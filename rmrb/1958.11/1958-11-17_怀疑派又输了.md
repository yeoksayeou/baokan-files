    The Skeptics Have Lost Again
    Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Reading is learning, and using is also learning, and it is even more important learning." These words profoundly tell us that only in production practice can we learn rich and living knowledge. The report from Xi'an Foreign Language Institute completely confirms this truth.
    Education must be combined with productive labor. Some skeptics initially doubted the correctness of this policy. Later, many industrial departments achieved great success in this regard, leaving them speechless. However, they did not give up. They said: Industrial departments can be combined, but other departments may be difficult! Now, Xi'an Foreign Language Institute uses its own achievements to declare to these people that other departments can and must implement the policy of combining education with productive labor. They have lost again.
    Learning is for use. If what is learned cannot be used, such learning is of little significance. The fact that Xi'an Foreign Language Institute has completely changed the past phenomenon of "what is learned cannot be used, and what is used cannot be learned" shows that we have found the correct path. Why bother with the skepticism of the skeptics?

### 怀疑派又输了

    怀疑派又输了
    毛泽东同志曾经说过：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”这些话深刻地告诉我们，只有在生产实践中才能学到丰富的、活的知识。西安外语学院的报道，完全印证了这个真理。
    教育必须和生产劳动结合，有些怀疑派们最初是怀疑这个方针的正确性的。后来，许多工业科系在这方面取得了很大成就，使得他们无话可说了。但是，他们并未服输，他们说：工业科系可以结合，其他科系可就难说了！现在，西安外语学院用自己的成就向这些人宣告，其他科系也同样可以和必需贯彻教育和生产劳动结合的方针。他们又输了一次。
    学习是为了使用，如果学了不能用，这样的学习是没有什么意义的。西安外语学院彻底改变了过去“学的用不上、用的学不来”的现象，这个事实，说明我们找到了正确的道路，何必理睬怀疑派的怀疑呢？
