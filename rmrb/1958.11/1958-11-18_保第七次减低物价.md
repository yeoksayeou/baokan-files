Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 16th - According to newspapers here today, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian Council of Ministers passed a resolution on the 14th, deciding to further reduce the prices of certain daily necessities, residential electricity, and gasoline from the 16th. According to regulations, the price reduction range for daily necessities ranges from 7% to 55%. This is the seventh time that Bulgaria has reduced the price of daily necessities since its liberation.

The rapid growth of Bulgaria's national income is the basis for its continuous reduction in the price of daily necessities. For example, last year, Bulgaria's national income had more than doubled compared to 1939 before liberation, an increase of 50% compared to 1952.

    保第七次减低物价
    据新华社索非亚16日电　据此间报纸今天报道：保加利亚共产党中央委员会和保加利亚部长会议14日通过决议，决定从16日起再次降低若干日用品、居民用电和汽油的价格。按照规定，日用品减价的幅度从7％到55％。这是保加利亚解放以后第七次降低日用品价格。
    保加利亚国民收入的迅速增长，是它能不断降低日用品价格的基础。例如，去年，保加利亚的国民收入已增加为解放前1939年的两倍以上，比1952年增加了50％。
