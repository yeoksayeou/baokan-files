Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: The rural areas of Shanxi Province have formed a large grain-picking army and launched a "Second Autumn Harvest" campaign, determined to gather every grain of the fruits of a year's hard work.

The "Second Autumn Harvest" campaign was decided upon after provincial, prefectural, county, township, and commune autumn harvest inspection teams conducted in-depth inspections in the fields and discovered the phenomenon of dropped ears and scattered grains during the rush harvest. The people's communes actively responded to this call and immediately mobilized women, the elderly, and children to form a "Second Autumn Harvest" army. Their slogan is: "Check every plot, pick up every ear, gather every grain; pick up the mature ears, grab the immature ones."

According to preliminary statistics from Changzhi, Yanbei, Qi County, Yuci and other regions, they have already collected more than 121.1 million catties of grain.

Our newspaper, Xian: Party organizations at all levels in Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, have taken effective measures to educate farmers to harvest and thresh carefully, and to pick up scattered grains and fallen cotton. Currently, more than 1,200 specialized teams have been organized, camping in the fields and fighting day and night, striving to bring back all the fruits of the harvest.

Xianyang County's more than 250,000 mu of autumn fields and 160,000 mu of cotton fields this year have increased production by more than double compared to last year. After the communization of the entire county, some farmers, intoxicated by the joy of high yields, mistakenly believed that grain could never be eaten all, and did not cherish grain, leading to a relatively common phenomenon of scattering grains. According to a responsible comrade of the Xianyang County People's Committee, the current loss of cotton due to unclean picking is generally about three catties per mu, with a total loss of more than 440,000 catties of seed cotton in the county, equivalent to more than 160,000 catties of lint cotton. The loss of corn and mung beans alone reached 2,435,000 catties. The Xianyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee paid great attention to the phenomenon of grain scattering in various places and demanded that this tendency be immediately corrected. They are to pick up the corn stalks and bean pods that can be picked up; the harvest in progress should be carried out carefully and meticulously. At present, an autumn harvest army of more than 70,000 people has been organized throughout the county, fighting day and night. After several days of effort, the four communes of Hongqi, Hongguang, Wuxing, and Wuyi have picked up more than 450,000 catties of grain in the harvested corn and mung bean fields.

    山西开展“第二次秋收”
    陕西咸阳纠正收打粗糙抛撒粮棉现象
    据新华社太原电　山西省农村组成拣粮大军，展开了“第二次秋收”运动，决心把一年来苦战的成果，颗粒不丢地拿到手里。
    “第二次秋收”运动，是最近省、专区、县、乡、社秋收检查团，深入田间检查，发现各地在连夜抢收中有丢穗、掉粒的现象以后决定展开的。各人民公社积极响应这一号召，立即发动妇女、老人和小孩，组成了“第二次秋收”大军。他们提出的口号是：“块块查、穗穗拾、粒粒拣，成穗的拣起来，不成穗的抓起来”。
    据长治、雁北、祈县、榆次等地区初步统计，他们已经拣回粮食一亿二千一百多万斤。
    本报西安电　陕西咸阳县农村的各级党组织采取有效措施，教育农民细收细打，拣拾抛撒的粮食颗粒和落地棉花。现在，全县已组织起一千二百多个专业队，在田野安营扎寨，日夜鏖战，力争把丰收果实全部拿回来。
    咸阳县今年二十五万多亩秋田和十六万亩棉花，比去年增产一倍以上。全县公社化后，有些农民陶醉于丰产的喜悦里，错误的认为粮食总是吃不完，不爱惜粮食，抛撒颗粒的现象比较普遍。据咸阳县人委负责同志告诉记者，目前各地棉花因拾的不净，每亩一般损失三斤左右，全县共损失籽棉四十四万多斤，合皮棉十六万多斤。包谷和绿豆两项的损失，即达二百四十三万五千斤。中共咸阳县委和县人委对各地抛撒粮食现象极为注意，要求各地立即纠正这种偏向。把能够拾回的棒子和豆角拾回来；正在收获的应认真细收、细打。目前，全县已组织起七万多人的秋收大军，日夜鏖战。红旗、红光、五星、五一四个公社经过几天努力，已在收过的包谷和绿豆地里拣回四十五万多斤粮食。
