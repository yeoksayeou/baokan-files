    Cotton Exposition
    By Our Correspondent
    The Turpan Cotton Experiment Station is one of the bases in our country with the largest collection and cultivation of cotton varieties. In its more than 500 mu of cotton fields, there are 231 varieties of cotton from both domestic and foreign sources. Cotton from Africa and the Americas, south and north of the Yangtze River, and almost every corner of the world, grows vigorously and luxuriantly here, resembling a magnificent cotton variety exposition.
    In early October, we entered this cotton field. We saw some cotton plants that were extremely tall, so tall that even on horseback you couldn't reach the top; others were short and dense, with the tallest only reaching the knee. The cotton leaves were of various shapes and colors. One variety, 5230B, had leaves larger than pumpkin leaves; another, the Huangjijiao (Yellow Chicken Foot) cotton, had leaves as slender as willow leaves; some cotton leaves were as red as maple leaves; and others were as purple as eggplants. The cotton fibers that emerged were of various colors, including white, yellow, green, and red, and there were distinctions between long-staple and short-staple cotton. One variety called Guanyin (Goddess of Mercy) cotton, with its budding tips blooming like vibrant crimson roses, was said to have been a tribute to the emperor as an ornamental flower thousands of years ago.
    Among these colorful cotton fields, the long-staple cotton (Sea Island cotton) was the most eye-catching. It grew the tallest, with leaves a deeper, darker green than ordinary cotton. Its bolls were massively producing fibers, with each plant having about fifty bolls, and the fibers were very fine.
    Long-staple cotton is an indispensable raw material for the development of modern industries such as aviation and automobile transportation. Growing it is still an emerging cotton-growing undertaking in our country. The Shanghai Cotton Textile Factory tested Turpan's long-staple cotton for spinning last year and proved that its fiber length was not inferior to imported Egyptian cotton, and its tensile strength and overall strength even exceeded that of Egyptian cotton.
    For the past five years, the Turpan Cotton Experiment Station has been consistently treating the cultivation, seed breeding, and propagation of long-staple cotton as an important task.
    The yield of long-staple cotton in various countries around the world is low, with small bolls and late maturity, and the yield rarely exceeds 400 jin of seed cotton per mu. The staff of the Turpan Cotton Experiment Station are using various methods such as hybridization, self-pollination, and selection to cultivate long-staple cotton with large bolls, early maturity, high yield, and good quality. Currently, there are 333 hybrid combinations.
    Upon entering the hybridization garden, one can see many hybrid cotton plants of different heights and colors. Several first generations of crosses between long-staple cotton and upland cotton have already shown significant hybrid vigor. They possess both the excellent quality of long-staple cotton with its fine and long fibers, and the characteristics of upland cotton with its large bolls, early maturity, and high yield.
    The concentration points for the cultivation of different varieties are the plant-row nursery and the original material nursery. This includes all sown cotton varieties and 414 selected lines. For scientific workers, each variety has its merits, and its "character" must be thoroughly understood during the experiment. For example, the Turpan ancient arboreum cotton, which has long been extinct, has been found by the Cotton Experiment Station through cultivation and research to still have excellent qualities of resistance to extreme heat and strong winds. Finding ways to transmit these advantages to other high-yield cotton varieties is also a new research topic.
    After visiting the Cotton Experiment Station, one is even more convinced that the Turpan Basin is an ideal cotton-growing paradise. The yield of various cotton varieties mostly exceeds 800 or 900 jin of seed cotton per mu. Even long-staple cotton, which has a relatively low yield worldwide, has a yield of 400 or 500 jin per mu this year. It is conceivable that with the development of China's aviation industry and automobile transportation industry, the entire Turpan Basin will become our country's long-staple cotton base.

    棉花博览会
    本报记者
    吐鲁番棉作试验站是我国保存和栽培棉花品种最多的基地之一。这里的五百多亩棉田里，生长着国内外各种棉花二百三十一种。非洲和美洲、江南、江北，几乎世界各个角落的棉花，在这里都生长得茁壮茂密，活像一幅气象万千的棉花品种博览会。
    10月初旬，我们进入这块棉花地。只见有的棉花高大无比，骑着马还攀不到顶端；有的棉花低矮稠密，高的也不过膝。棉花叶子，形形色色，有一种五二三零B的棉叶，比南瓜叶子还大；有一种黄鸡脚棉叶却细长如柳叶；有一种棉花叶子红似枫叶；有一种棉叶紫如茄子。吐出的棉絮一朵一朵，既有白、黄、绿、红各种颜色，又有长绒、短绒的区分。有一种名叫观音棉的品种，顶尖的花蕾绽开，娇艳得像紫红色的蔷薇，据说千百年前，它是进贡给皇帝的用作观赏的花卉。
    在这种五光十色的棉田中，长绒棉（海师棉）最吸引人注意。它生长得最为高大，绿叶比一般棉花更为深黑。它的棉桃正在大量吐絮，每株桃数多在五十个左右，长出的纤维很细。
    长绒棉是一种发展航空和汽车运输等现代工业不可缺少的原料。种它在我国还是一项新兴的植棉事业。上海棉纺厂去年试用吐鲁番的长绒棉纺纱，证明它的纤维长度并不亚于进口的埃及棉，而且在拉力和强度方面还超过了埃及棉。
    五年来，吐鲁番棉作试验站一直把长绒棉的栽培、种子育培和繁殖作为一项重要的任务。
    世界各国的长绒棉都因为棉铃小、成熟晚，单产很少超过籽棉四百斤。吐鲁番棉作试验站的职工正在采用杂交、自交、选育等各种办法培育铃大、早熟、产量高、质量好的长绒棉。目前杂交的组合就有三百三十三个。
    一进入杂交圃，就可以看到许许多多高矮不等、颜色不一的杂种棉。有几种长绒棉和陆地棉杂交的第一代，已经表现出了明显的杂种优势。它既具有长绒棉纤维细长的优良品质，又具有陆地棉铃大、早熟、产量高的性能。
    不同品种栽培的集中地点是株行圃和原始材料圃。这里包括了全部播种的棉花品种和四百一十四个选系。对于科学工作者来说，每一种品种都有它可取之处，必须在试验过程中把它的“性格”摸透。即如像久已绝迹的吐鲁番古老的草棉，棉作试验站经过栽培研究，发现它还有抵抗酷热和狂风等特殊气候的优良品质。设法把这种优点遗传给其他高产棉花，也是一项新的研究课题。
    参观完棉作试验站后，更令人信服吐鲁番盆地是生长棉花理想的天国。各式各样棉花产量单产多在籽棉八、九百斤。即如世界产量较低的长绒棉，今年亩产也有四、五百斤。可以想见，随着我国航空事业和汽车运输事业的发展，整个吐鲁番盆地，将会变成我国的长绒棉基地。
