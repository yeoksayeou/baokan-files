Xinhua News Agency, November 1st. This year, China's textile industry has achieved unprecedented high-speed development. Cotton, wool, linen, silk products, capital construction, and textile machinery manufacturing have all made significant leaps forward compared to last year. According to the production results of the first nine months and the production situation for the next three months, the Ministry of Textile Industry estimates that China will produce 6.66 million bales of cotton yarn in 1958, an increase of 43.15% over 1957; cotton cloth will reach 6.4078 billion meters, an increase of 26.86% over 1957; woolen fabrics will be 23.57 million meters, an increase of 29.72% over 1957; silk fabrics will be 195.24 million meters, an increase of 85.45% over 1957; and麻袋麻袋 bags will be 115.74 million, an increase of 39.21% over last year. The growth rate of these products not only greatly exceeds the average annual growth rate of the First Five-Year Plan but also greatly exceeds the fastest growth rate of 1956 in the First Five-Year Plan. The growth rate of cotton yarn in 1956 was 32%, while this year it is 43.15%.

While rapidly increasing production, the quality of products has also been significantly improved, and the variety of patterns has been continuously increased. The quality of many textiles has reached or exceeded international advanced levels. From January to August this year, Shanghai has trial-produced more than 1,100 new products, including high-grade gabardine, embossed overcoating, and fancy suitings, which have reached or exceeded the level of similar well-known British products.

The great leap forward in the textile industry this year is inseparable from the implementation of the central government's policy of "the whole Party and the entire people running industry." The implementation of this policy has greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses in running the textile industry. This year, the national cotton spinning industry has a construction scale of more than 2 million spindles, which is equivalent to more than 80% of the total number of newly built spindles during the First Five-Year Plan period. These spindles are distributed in eighteen provinces and cities across the country, and many key points have been established in some provinces, thus initially forming a situation of textile enterprises blooming everywhere. Because these newly built enterprises are mainly small and medium-sized, combining indigenous and foreign methods, making use of whatever is available, they require less investment, take less time, and yield quick results. For example, Wuhu Yuejin Yarn Factory in Anhui Province used the auditorium as a factory building, installed the original discarded machines, and spent only more than 200,000 yuan, putting it into production in just over a month.

Another decisive factor in the great leap forward in the textile industry this year is the vigorous tapping of the potential of existing enterprises, which has led to a rapid increase in the output of old factories. Under the resounding slogan of "Attacking the high-speed barrier, doubling production, consuming all cotton, and piling up yarn and cloth like mountains," Shanghai textile workers boldly accelerated the speed of various spinning frames and looms, and without increasing textile equipment or manpower, the city's cotton yarn output in the third quarter increased by 54% compared with the same period last year, and cotton cloth increased by 68%.

The great leap forward in the textile industry this year was achieved under the circumstances that more than 2 million textile workers across the country brought into play their soaring energy to overcome many difficulties. For example, the power supply in Northeast China was tight, and textile factories in Liaoning Province generally suffered from insufficient power supply in September. However, the workers of each factory used automobile heads, tractors, fire trucks, etc. to drive the machines, and even used hand-cranked and foot-pedaled methods to drive the machines, and insisted on production. The supply of various parts and materials for textile machines was tight, so textile factories in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Shandong vigorously set up satellite factories to manufacture their own accessories such as steel wire rings and steel collars to supply their own factories' needs.

    纺织厂里彩霞万丈
    增产幅度赛过前年　许多产品压倒英国
    据新华社1日讯　我国纺织工业今年获得了史无前例的高速度发展。棉、毛、麻、丝各项产品、基本建设和纺织机械制造都比去年有很大的跃进。纺织工业部根据前九个月生产实绩和今后三个月的生产情况分析，预计1958年我国将生产棉纱六百六十六万件，比1957年增长43.15％；棉布将达到六十四万零七百八十万公尺，比1957年增长26.86％；毛织品二千三百五十七万公尺，比1957年增长29.72％；丝织品一万九千五百二十四万公尺，比1957年增长85.45％；麻袋一万一千五百七十四万条，比去年增长39.21％。这些产品增长的速度，不仅大大超过了第一个五年计划平均每年增长的速度，而且也大大超过了第一个五年计划中增长速度最快的1956年。1956年棉纱的增长速度是32％，而今年则是43.15％。
    在高速度地增加生产的同时，产品的质量也有显著提高，花式品种不断增加。许多纺织品的质量已经达到或超过国际先进水平。上海市今年1月至8月份已试制出一千一百多种新产品，其中高级华达呢、拷花大衣呢、花呢等都达到或超过了英国同类名牌产品的水平。
    今年纺织工业的大跃进，是和各地贯彻执行中央提出的全党全民办工业的方针分不开的。这一方针的贯彻，大大发挥了广大群众办纺织工业的积极性。今年全国棉纺工业建设规模达二百多万纱锭，相当于第一个五年计划期间新建纱锭总数的80％以上。这些纱锭分布在全国十八个省市，有些省内又建立了许多基点，这样就初步形成了纺织企业遍地开花的局面。由于这些新建企业以中小型为主，土洋结合，因陋就简，因此投资少，时间短，收效快。例如安徽省芜湖跃进纱厂利用大礼堂作厂房，安装上原来的废机器，只花了二十多万元，建设一个多月就投入了生产。
    今年纺织工业大跃进的另一决定因素是大力挖掘了现有企业的潜力，使老厂产量飞速提高。上海纺织工人在“猛攻高速关，产量翻几番，棉花全吃尽，纱布堆成山”的响亮口号下，大胆加快了各种细纱机和布机的车速，在纺织设备、人力没有增加的情况下，使全市第三季度棉纱产量比去年同期增加54％，棉布增加68％。
    今年纺织工业的大跃进，是在全国二百多万纺织工人发挥冲天干劲克服许多困难的情况下实现的。例如东北电力紧张，辽宁省各纺织厂在9月份电力供应普遍不足。但是，各厂职工利用汽车头、拖拉机、消防车等来开动机器，甚至用手摇、脚踏的办法开动机器，坚持了生产。纺织机上的各种零件和机物料供应紧张，四川、陕西、山东的纺织厂就大办卫星厂，自造钢丝圈、钢领等配件，供应本厂需要。（附图表）
