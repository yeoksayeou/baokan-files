Today's Soviet Science
A. ? Smirnov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences

The Great October Socialist Revolution, realized forty-one years ago, opened a new era in human history—a new era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism. The countries of the socialist camp have achieved outstanding successes in socialist construction on their path forward.

The close unity of the Chinese and Soviet people, who account for about one-third of the world's population, is an invincible force. This force is of decisive significance for the struggle of the people of all countries in the world to defend peace and oppose war.

The achievements of the Chinese people fill all those who are fortunate enough to witness the hard work, perseverance, discipline, and creative spirit of the Chinese people with immense joy.

Chinese scientists have made invaluable contributions to the world's human treasure. They are doing everything they can to create a scientific foundation for their country's magnificent economic and cultural construction. Soviet scientists wholeheartedly help them to discuss scientific and advanced technical issues in order to apply scientific achievements to the national economy.

Last year, the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences signed a cooperation agreement. The agreement stipulates a wide exchange of experience, information, and documents, mutual visits to make reports, improvement of scientific research methods, and joint research on various issues. In the implementation of this agreement, many Chinese graduate students and scientific workers are working in the institutions of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Our academicians, corresponding members, professors, doctors, and associate doctors also frequently visit China for varying lengths of time.

The goals of scientists in the Soviet Union and China are the same, which is to use their research work to fully promote the high tide of national economic development, the development of the cultural and material well-being of the masses, and technological progress.

Soviet scientists are greeting the 41st anniversary of the Great October Revolution with important achievements.

The successful implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU is a powerful driving force for the extensive development of Soviet scientific theory and experimental work, and remarkable results have already been achieved. Mathematicians, theoretical physicists, physicists, and experimental chemists, in their purposeful joint efforts with engineers and designers in the peaceful use of atomic energy and nuclear reactions, have enabled the Soviet Union to take a leading position in the main aspects of natural science and technology. Physicists are increasingly delving into the mysterious realm of the atomic nucleus. In Dubna, near Moscow, there is one of the world's largest basic particle accelerators, with a power of 10 billion electron volts. In our country, the world's first atomic power station with a generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts was put into production, and not long ago the first phase of another huge atomic power station was completed and began generating electricity, with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. The "Lenin" atomic icebreaker, equipped with electric turbines, has been launched.

One of the most important achievements of Soviet science in 1958 was the exploration of outer space. A little more than a year ago, the first artificial satellite was launched into space. On November 3, 1957, the second artificial satellite appeared. Then, on May 15 this year, the third artificial satellite, a veritable automatic scientific laboratory in space, was launched. This is the result of the creative work of Soviet scientists and designers, based on the high level of radio electronics and automation in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union has made great achievements in nuclear physics. Soviet scientists have made successful progress in mastering thermonuclear synthesis and utilizing thermonuclear energy. Solving this task would forever guarantee mankind an unlimited source of power. To this end, the Atomic Energy Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has built a powerful "Ogra" device. The results of theoretical and experimental work recently carried out by Soviet scientists in controlling thermonuclear reactions have been presented at the Second International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy held in Geneva in September this year.

In the Soviet state, science has become a tool for reforming nature and society. On the basis of science and relying on the achievements of the latest advanced technical ideas, a national economic development plan has been formulated to create a material basis for communism. Advanced Soviet science is a child of socialism.

The utilization of Soviet scientific achievements plays an increasingly important role in the Soviet national economy, national defense, and cultural life. In our country, special attention is paid to the development of theoretical sciences—mathematics, mechanics, physics, chemistry, biology, geology—and to the application of the research results of these sciences in technology, medicine, and agriculture.

Omnipotent or dedicated to solving local problems (such as managing machines) fast electronic computers are a very important department of the latest science and national economy. Soviet scientists and designers have created a series of fast computers and have formulated machine calculation methods. This machine solves various problems in nuclear physics, space flight, mechanics, and gas dynamics. The further development of the theory and new principles of establishing an automatic power system for managing and controlling new technological equipment, based on the wide use of the achievements of physics, radio electronics, and computing technology, is of great significance. The general line of technological development in our country is the complete automation of physical labor processes and the use of automatic machines to assist mental labor.

In pre-revolutionary Russia, there was practically no chemical industry. The Soviet chemical industry has grown up relying on the research of scientists. Lebedev developed synthetic rubber, which was an original invention that had the fastest and most direct impact on industrial development. These works are the result of years of research on unsaturated hydrocarbons, especially hydrocarbons with conjugated double bonds.

The achievements of Soviet chemistry include: the production of a variety of synthetic rubbers, including synthetic rubber identical to natural rubber; the production of new types of electrical insulating resins, plastics for various uses; new types of synthetic fibers, artificial leather, and artificial fur. These achievements have created conditions for the great leap forward in the development of the Soviet chemical industry. The task before chemists is to manufacture artificial materials of particularly valuable quality for use in all aspects of technology and people's lives. New technologies require the creation of heat-resistant, lightweight, strong, and non-corrosive metals and alloys, heat-resistant plastics, rubber, and glass, especially strong fibers and crystals harder than diamonds. In the machinery manufacturing industry, strong and lightweight plastics will be widely used to replace metals in the future.

The achievements of Soviet geology are most evident in the discovery and research of a series of huge deposits of coal, oil, natural combustible gas, iron and non-ferrous metals, as well as diamonds, rare metals, and radioactive minerals. The overall research level of the Soviet geological community has been greatly improved. The Soviet national geological and crustal structure map, which is necessary for studying theoretical and practical problems of prospecting and exploring mineral resources, has been successfully compiled. The inexhaustible oil resources of the Volga River basin and the huge high-quality iron ore in the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly region are being developed on an increasing scale.

Wherever our country is building industries and cultivating fields, wherever Soviet people are working, science should be developed everywhere. The Soviet Academy of Sciences attaches great importance to the Siberian Branch established in Novosibirsk. The Siberian Branch should become the scientific and creative center of research institutions that are widely developing in the eastern part of our country.

The Siberian Productivity Research Conference was held in Irkutsk in August this year. At the meeting, scientists and representatives of the National Economic Council, industry, and agriculture, in a spirit of creative cooperation, discussed the most reasonable ways to develop this most fertile region. 75% of the Soviet Union's coal mines, 80% of its hydropower resources, and 80% of its forestry resources are concentrated in this region.

Communist construction requires the creative development of social sciences and the struggle against bourgeois ideology. It is necessary to study the philosophical problems of dialectical materialism on the basis of analyzing the latest achievements of natural and social sciences; it is necessary to explain world history from a Marxist point of view, that is, the law-governed process of society advancing towards communism, and to explain the regularity of the development of social relations and cultural life (science, literature, art, and state construction in the socialist and transitional era to communism).

Soviet scientists are enthusiastically participating in formulating the scientific basis for the Soviet national economic development plan for 1959-1965. The 21st Congress of the CPSU, to be held in January next year, will discuss the control figures of this plan. The resolutions of this congress will show the Soviet people an exciting prospect of advancing towards communism and will inspire socialist builders all over the world to engage in creative work.

I would like to extend brotherly greetings to the great Chinese people who are building socialism and are united and firmly struggling against the interference of imperialist aggressors in China's internal affairs.

Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and China, the strong fortress of world peace!

Long live communism, the bright future of all mankind!

    今日的苏联科学
    苏联科学院院长　阿·?斯米扬诺夫
    四十一年前实现的伟大十月社会主义革命，开辟了人类历史的新纪元——资本主义溃灭和社会主义胜利的新纪元。社会主义阵营各国在自己前进的道路上，取得了社会主义建设的杰出成就。
    约占全世界人口三分之一的中苏两国人民的紧密团结，是一个不可战胜的力量。这个力量对于全世界各国人民保卫和平、反对战争的斗争具有决定的意义。
    中国人民的成就，使一切有幸看到中国人民的勤劳、坚毅、纪律性和创造精神的人，都感到万分的欢欣。
    中国的科学家，对于世界的人类宝藏作出了无可估价的贡献。他们正在尽一切力量，为自己祖国宏伟的经济和文化建设创立科学基础。苏联科学家衷心地帮助他们研讨科学问题和先进技术问题，以便把科学成就运用到国民经济中去。
    去年苏联科学院同中国科学院签订了一项合作协定。协定中规定广泛地交流经验、情报和文献，相互访问作报告，改善科学研究方法，以及共同研究各种问题。在执行这一协定中，有很多的中国研究生和科学工作者在苏联科学院的机关里工作。我国的院士、通讯院士、教授、博士和副博士，也以或长或短的时间，经常到中国进行访问。
    苏中两国科学家的目标是一致的，这就是以自己的研究工作全力促进国家经济的高涨、人民群众文化和物质福利的发展，以及技术的进步。
    苏联科学家以重要的成就来迎接伟大的十月革命四十一周年。
    成功地实现苏共第二十次代表大会的决议，对于广泛地发展苏联的科学理论和实验工作，是一个强大的推动力，而且已经取得了卓越的成果。数学家、理论物理学家、物理学家和实验化学家，在和平利用原子能和核子反应这一工作上，同工程师、设计师们作的目的鲜明的共同努力，促使苏联在自然科学和技术的主要方面跃居先进的地位。物理学家日益深入到原子核的奥秘境地。在莫斯科附近的杜布纳有一个世界上最大的基本粒子加速器，它的功率是一百亿电子伏特。在我国首先有世界上第一个发电能力达五千瓩的原子发电站投入生产，不久以前又一个巨大的原子发电站的第一期工程完工并开始发电，它的发电能力为十万瓩。装有电气涡轮的“列宁号”原子破冰船，已经下水。
    1958年苏联科学最重要的成就之一，是深入了宇宙空间。在一年稍多一点以前，第一颗人造卫星上了天。1957年11月3日，又出现了第二颗人造卫星。接着在今年5月15日又发射了作为名副其实的宇宙自动化科学试验室的第三颗人造卫星。这是在苏联拥有无线电子学和自动学的高度水平下，苏联科学家和设计师创造性工作的成果。
    在核子物理学方面苏联取得了巨大的成就。苏联科学家在掌握热核合成和利用热核能方面有了成功的进展。解决这方面的任务，就可以永远保证人类有无限的动力源泉。为此，苏联科学院原子能研究所，建立了一个强大的“奥格拉”装置。近来苏联科学家在控制热核反应方面进行的理论与实验工作的成果，已经被介绍给今年9月在日内瓦召开的和平利用原子能第二次国际会议。
    在苏维埃国家里，科学成了改革自然和社会的工具。在科学的基础上，依靠最新的先进技术思想的成就，制定了为共产主义创立物质基础的国民经济发展计划。先进的苏联科学，是社会主义的产儿。
    利用苏联科学成就一事，在苏联的国民经济、国防和文化生活中起着越来越重大的意义。在我国特别重视理论科学——数学、机械学、物理学、化学、生物学、地质学——的发展和在技术、医疗和农业方面利用这些科学的研究成果。
    万能的或专为解决局部课题（例如管理机器）的快速电子计算机，是最新科学和国民经济的一个非常重要的部门。苏联科学家和设计师，创立了一系列的快速计算机，并且制定了机器计算的方法。这种机器解决了核子物理学、宇宙飞行、机械学、气体动力学方面的各种课题。在广泛地利用物理学、无线电子学、计算技术的成就的基础上，建立管理操纵自动机新技术设备的电力自动体系的理论和新原则的进一步发展，具有重大的意义。我国技术发展的总路线，是体力劳动过程的全盘自动化和以自动机帮助脑力劳动。
    在革命前的俄国实际上不曾有化学工业。苏联的化学工业是依靠科学家的研究而成长起来的。列别捷夫研制了合成橡胶，这是独创性的发明，对于工业发展有最快和直接的影响。这些工作都是多年研究不饱合碳氢化合物，特别是具有共轭双键的碳氢化合物的结果。
    苏联化学的成就有：制成了多种的合成橡胶，其中包括同天然橡胶相同的合成橡胶；制成新的电气绝缘树脂品种、各种用途的塑料；新型的合成纤维、人造皮、人造毛皮。这些成就为苏联化学工业发展的大跃进，创造了条件。摆在化学家面前的任务，就是要为供技术和人民生活一切方面使用而制造人造的质地特别宝贵的材料。新的技术要求创制耐热、轻便、坚韧而又不腐蚀的金属和合金，耐热的塑料，橡胶和玻璃，特别是坚韧的纤维、硬度超过钻石的晶体。在机器制造业方面，将来要广泛地采用牢固而轻便的塑料来代替金属。
    苏联地质学的成就，最明显地表现在发现和研究了一系列巨大的煤、石油、天然可燃性煤气、铁和有色金属的矿床，以及钻石、稀有金属和放射性矿物。苏联地质学界的总的研究水平已经大大地提高。为研究探测和勘察矿产的理论和实践问题所必需的苏联全国地质与地壳结构图，已经编制成功。伏尔加河流域取用不竭的石油资源、库尔斯克磁性反常地区的巨大的优质铁矿的开发范围越来越广了。
    凡是我国在建设工业和耕种田地的地方，凡是有苏维埃人劳动的地方，到处都应该发展科学。苏联科学院对在诺沃西比尔斯克建立的西伯利亚分院极为重视。西伯利亚分院，应该成为在我国东部广泛发展的研究机关的科学创造中心。
    今年8月间在伊尔库茨克召开了西伯利亚生产力研究会议。在会上，科学家们和国民经济委员会、工业和农业的代表们，本着创造性的合作精神，讨论了开发这一最富饶地区的最合理的办法。苏联全国75％的煤矿、80％的水力资源和80％的林业资源，都集中在这个地区。
    共产主义建设要求创造性地发展社会科学和进行反对资产阶级思想的斗争。必须在分析自然科学和社会科学最新成就的基础上，研讨辩证唯物主义哲学问题；必须以马克思主义观点来阐明世界历史，就是社会向共产主义前进的合乎规律的过程，阐明社会关系和文化生活（社会主义和向共产主义过渡时代的科学、文学、艺术、国家建设）发展的规律性。
    苏联的科学家们热心地参加制定1959—1965年苏联国民经济发展计划的科学基础。明年1月举行的苏共第二十一次代表大会，将对这个计划的控制数字进行讨论。这次代表大会的决议，将在苏联人民的面前，展示出向共产主义前进的激动人心的前景，而且会鼓舞全世界的社会主义建设者从事创造性的工作。
    谨向正在建设社会主义，并且团结一致地坚决为反对帝国主义侵略者干涉中国内政而斗争的伟大的中国人民致以兄弟般的敬礼。
    世界和平的强大堡垒——苏中两国人民牢不可破的友谊合作万岁！
    全人类的光辉未来——共产主义万岁！（附图片）
    莫斯科将建造发射第一颗人造地球卫星的纪念碑。这是纪念碑的设计图
