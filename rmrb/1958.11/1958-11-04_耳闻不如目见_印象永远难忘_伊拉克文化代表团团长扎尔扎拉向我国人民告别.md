Seeing is Believing, Impressions are Unforgettable
Iraqi Cultural Delegation Head Zarzala Bids Farewell to the Chinese People

(Our Newspaper) The Iraqi Republic Cultural Delegation recently concluded its friendly visit to our country. On the eve of his departure from Beijing, the head of the delegation, Zarzala, delivered a farewell address, the full text of which is as follows:

As we are about to leave your beautiful country, I feel I must, in my personal name and on behalf of my colleagues, the members of the delegation, express our sincere gratitude and deepest appreciation to the Government of the People's Republic of China for the extremely thoughtful care and sublime feelings shown by everyone we met during our visits and formal and private conversations.

From the first meeting, the warm reception we received and the joy clearly evident on the faces of all the people we met in the countryside, schools, factories, and shops clearly demonstrated the long-established warm friendship. In the Arab people's struggle to defend world peace and its security, the generous Chinese people have always spared no effort to show the existence of this friendship to the Arab people.

Before I came to your beautiful country, I had heard many talks about the generosity, loyalty, sincerity, and noble character of the Chinese people. I also heard many reports about the intelligence, ingenuity, patience, and fearlessness of difficulties of the Chinese people. Although the old regime in Iraq did not allow us to know the news of the people of free countries, we still read many things. Yes, I read materials on the great achievements made by the Chinese People's Government in all aspects, but, believe me, what we saw during this visit was far more moving than what I read and heard.

Congratulations to you, the Chinese people, and congratulations to your loyal leaders and sincere politicians, who have dedicated their entire lives and energy to seeking peace and prosperity for you and your friends.

The impressions gained during our visit of all the people and places will remain forever in my memory, and the memory of this visit will always make me and my colleagues proud. My colleagues often tell me that they are happy and admire everything they have seen and heard.

On the day of the birth of our republic, you made various expressions to maintain our cause. You took the initiative to promote cultural relations between our two countries, inviting us to visit here, and inviting some of our compatriots to visit here shortly before we came here. I hope these relationships will become increasingly great.

Now, as I look back on the scene of being with you for a month, I and my companions feel that we are living with sincere friends without restraint and courtesy, and your goals and wishes are also our goals and wishes. Therefore, I will be very sorry if I cannot express in these few short words the love, admiration and respect in my heart and in the hearts of my friends for the friendly Chinese people and for the noble leaders of the Chinese people. If we could shake hands with each of you and personally express our admiration to everyone, we would certainly do so.

At the same time, I must say that all the valuable knowledge that responsible people have enabled us to obtain will help us solve many problems facing our country in teaching and education, and apply many of the ideas and views discussed with your scientists and experts.

Finally, the members of our Iraqi Republic Cultural Delegation really do not know how to fully express our gratitude for all the time and energy you have spent and the hospitality you have shown, no matter how we want to do so, but we hope that we will be fortunate enough to welcome your delegation to Baghdad in the near future so that our Iraqi people can slightly repay your hospitality.

Goodbye, my friends, and good luck to you!

    耳闻不如目见  印象永远难忘
    伊拉克文化代表团团长扎尔扎拉向我国人民告别
    本报讯　伊拉克共和国文化代表团最近结束在我国的友好访问。在离开北京前夕，该团团长扎尔扎拉发表了告别词，全文如下：
    当我们就要离开你们的美丽的国家的时候，我觉得我必须以我个人的名义并且代表我的同事们、代表团的团员们，对中华人民共和国政府表示我们真诚的感谢和最深切的谢意，感谢在我们进行访问以及正式和私人谈话中我们遇到的每一个人表现的极其周到的照顾和崇高的感情。
    从第一次见面的时候起，对我们的热情接待以及我们在农村、学校、工厂和商店里从所有的人的脸上明显地看出的那种喜悦，清楚地说明了早就建立的亲切友谊。在阿拉伯人保卫世界和平和它的安全的斗争中，慷慨的中国人民始终不惜余力地对阿拉伯人表示这种友谊的存在。
    在我前来你们美好的国家以前，我已经听到许多关于中国人的慷慨、忠实、真诚和高尚品德的谈论。我也听到许多关于中国人的聪明、灵巧、有耐心和不怕困难的报道。尽管伊拉克的旧政权不让我们知道自由国家的人民的消息，我们还是读到许多东西。是的，我读到中国人民政府在各方面获得的巨大成就的材料，但是，请相信我，我们在这次访问中所看到的东西远比我所读到的和听到的要动人得多。
    祝贺你们——中国人民，祝贺你们的忠实的领袖和真诚的政治家，他们献出了他们整个生命和精力，为你们和你们的朋友谋求和平和繁荣。
    在我们访问期间所获得的关于所有的人和地方的印象，将永远留在我的记忆中，这次访问的纪念将永远使我和我的同事们感到骄傲，我的同事们经常对我表示，他们对他们所看到和听到的一切感到高兴和钦佩。
    在我们的共和国诞生的日子里，你们作了各种表示来维护我们的事业。你们主动地促进我们两国之间的文化关系，邀请我们到这里访问，并且邀请我国的一些同胞在我们来到这里之前不久来这里访问。我希望这些关系将日益发扬光大。
    现在，当我回顾我们同你们相处的一个月的情景的时候，我同我的同伴们一样觉得，我们是同真诚的朋友们毫无拘束和客套地生活在一起，你们的目的和愿望也是我们的目的和愿望。因此，如果我用这短短的几句话不能表示我心中和我的朋友们心中对友好的中国人民和对中国人民的崇高领袖们的热爱、钦佩和尊敬的话，我将非常抱歉。如果我们能够和你们每一个人握手，并且亲自对所有的人表达我们的钦佩，我们将一定这样做。
    同时，我必须说，负责人士使我们能够得到的所有宝贵的知识，将帮助我们解决我们的国家在教导和教育方面面临的许多问题，并且应用同你们的科学家和专家们一起讨论的许多意见和观点。
    最后，我们伊拉克共和国文化代表团团员们真不知道怎样才能对你们所花的全部时间和精力以及所表现的好客态度表示充分的感谢，不管我们怎样想这样做，但是我们希望，我们能够有幸在最近的将来在巴格达欢迎你们的代表团，以便我们伊拉克人民稍稍回报你们的盛情。
    再见了，我的朋友们，祝你们好！
