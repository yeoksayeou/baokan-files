Practice is the Mother of Science
Yang Kuangbao, Director of the Lujiiao First Cooperative and Party Branch Secretary, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province

    After several years of effort, our cooperative has now selected and bred 33 varieties of high-quality rice, established seed fields and seed comparison trial fields, organized seed professional teams, seed selection shock brigades, and seed technology research groups, greatly promoting production. The average rice yield per mu has increased from 470 jin in 1954 to more than 1,000 jin in 1957, and is expected to reach more than 2,000 jin this year. We also plan to establish a seed cooperative next year to supply the seeds needed for 200,000 mu (two-fifths of the county's rice acreage) of rice in the county. The following is an account of my process from not understanding seed selection at all to gradually mastering some of the rules of seed selection.

    Breaking Old Habits to Select Good Seeds Greatly Increased Grain Production and Confidence
    After the land reform, I joined the first mutual aid group in Luqiao. I only had one simple wish in my heart: Now that the land is my own, no landlord can take away the yield, no matter how high it is. Therefore, we must respond to the call of the Party and the government and increase the yield as high as possible, even higher!

    It was this simple wish that prompted me to actively seek out all the keys to increasing production. I pondered all day long, and naturally thought of improving seeds.

    So, I started looking for good rice seeds. Once, I happened to hear students from Taizhou Agricultural School say that they had a good rice variety called "503". The next day, I rushed to buy seven jin of it. Another time, I passed through Aowang Village, Shiqu Township, and saw a farmer's field where a rice variety called "Coarse Stalk White" was growing very well, so I bought twenty jin of seeds back.

    Cultivating foreign new varieties was truly an incomprehensible thing for farmers who had grown the same old varieties for generations.

    Afraid of being laughed at, I hid alone in the house, selecting seeds grain by grain, and didn't even go out for the Spring Festival. Unfortunately, a person with conservative ideas barged in. He spread this "news" everywhere, mocking me, and even people in the same mutual aid group didn't dare to cooperate with me at that time.

    I had to work alone. After sowing, I guarded the seedlings in the field all day long. When transplanting, the mutual aid group still didn't help.

    After transplanting, I was very anxious, running to the field countless times in the morning and evening. The situation in the field did not disappoint me: the new variety "503" was growing smoothly.

    But by June 26th, other people's rice had already been harvested, while only 60% of "503" was ripe. According to the weather forecast, there would be strong winds and heavy rain on the 27th, so we had to rush to harvest immediately. Even so, "503" still yielded 365 jin per mu, 95 jin more than "Guangdong White".

    Late rice was planted with the new variety "Coarse Stalk White". After planting, it grew very strong, with straight stalks and clean leaves, and it was not afraid of pests, diseases, or rice blast. Even people with conservative ideas couldn't help but nod in approval.

    "Coarse Stalk White" yielded 440 jin per mu, 66 jin more than other varieties. After harvesting, people came to exchange seeds with me.

    From then on, I became even more obsessed with seeds. As long as I heard of a good variety, I couldn't eat or sleep well, and I always tried to find a way to get it.

    Boldly Reform the Cropping System Achieving Bumper Harvests in Both Early and Late Rice

    The initial achievements in 1952 were an important beginning for me.

    This year, our mutual aid group set a production target of 750 jin per mu. The target was much higher than others. When we considered how to achieve this target, we felt that it was not enough to rely solely on promoting the selection and breeding of new varieties, and we had to open up new paths. Where were the new paths?

    Intercropping is an old method passed down here for generations. The biggest drawback of this farming method is that it cannot be densely planted (only 7,000 plants per mu), and the land utilization rate is very low, which has become a major obstacle to increasing production. At this time, I thought: Could we postpone the transplanting time of late rice until after the early rice is harvested? In this way, the number of early rice plants could be increased from 7,000 to 16,000 per mu. According to the estimated increase in the number of plants, the yield could be increased by at least 50%. Using this method, it was no problem to increase the yield of early rice, but was it feasible to postpone the transplanting of late rice by two months? I immediately found the answer to this question. I remembered that every year after the early rice harvest, because some of the late rice had already died, we always had to replant some late rice seedlings in the intercropped rice fields. These replanted late rice seedlings still grew very well and did not affect the harvest. Since replanting works, why can't all late transplanting work? So, I decided to experiment in my own one and one-third mu of land.

    My plan to grow continuous cropping rice was again opposed by people with conservative ideas. Some people said to me: "You are obsessed with being a model! Planting so densely is sure to cause lodging." I ignored them.

    I was not worried about the early rice. Sure enough, the early rice yielded 580 jin per mu, 300 jin more than others. But I was worried about the late rice. What if the northwest wind blows in the fall and it doesn't produce ears?

    Four or five days after the late rice was transplanted, other people's intercropped late rice was already one and a half feet tall, while mine was only three or four inches tall, and the color was really ugly. Some people said: "The rice stalks are as long as chopsticks, and the whole field is feeding cow grass!" I buried my head and stepped up fertilization and weeding, weeding five times, and the rice gradually caught up. After the Autumnal Equinox, other people's rice had already headed, while my rice stalks were still shriveled. I went to see it for four or five days, peeled open the stalks, and there was still nothing. People were shouting in my ear again: "Hurry up and feed it to the yellow cow, anyway, your family has a big yellow cow." It was really annoying to hear!

    Although I was annoyed, my confidence did not waver. I thought: We must resolutely carry on and persist to the end to win. If we fail, we will try again. Three days later, I went to the field again and casually pulled one open to take a look. Oh, it's heading! I could hardly believe my eyes, and I was unspeakably happy. The next day, most of the rice headed, and ten days later, the rice ears were all drooping heavily.

    All the members of the mutual aid group came to help with the harvest. After harvesting, it weighed 446 jin per mu, plus the 580 jin of early rice, for a total of 1,026 jin. People with conservative ideas had to be convinced by the facts. The harvested grain was exchanged by everyone for seeds.

    Annual Seed Selection Greatly Increased Production Utilizing Hybridization to Breed New Varieties

    In 1954, the elementary cooperative was established. It has become a generally accepted fact that good seeds can increase production. However, there was still a lot of ideological resistance to the practice of annual seed selection and seed fields.

    I decided to use facts to convince them again. I created several comparison fields with and without ear selection, and then organized the cooperative members to visit and discuss. The facts were very clear: The same "Black Mouth Glutinous" rice seeds grew much more uniformly after ear selection, and the grains were also fuller, yielding 55 jin more per mu, "Nante No. 1" yielded 37 jin more, and "Dajing White" yielded 51 jin more. Such a big difference! Everyone understood. The cooperative members wrote a rhythmic jingle praising it: "Selecting rice seeds is very good, the rice heads grow heavy; full and bright, one season can yield a thousand jin of grain!"

    That autumn, in the heavy waves of rice, I suddenly found a few rice ears growing particularly well, with tall plants, thick stalks, and long ears, different from the others. I estimated that this was a hybrid of "Black Mouth Glutinous" and the nearby "Yellow Glutinous", and I thought: "If the glutinous rice all grows this well, then wouldn't the yield increase a lot!"

    At harvest, I pulled out the best sixteen plants. The next year, I marked a small plot in my seedling field and planted these sixteen rice ears, and then surrounded them with straw. At the autumn harvest, I harvested more than ten jin of seeds, each grain full and promising. So, I selected and sowed them separately every year, painstakingly managing them and expanding them year by year. This year, 75% of the cooperative's fields have been planted with this new variety.

    After several years of careful cultivation, its performance has developed new features, with a yield about 20% higher than the original "Black Mouth Glutinous", strong cold resistance, and no rice blast, and it has become an outstanding high-quality new variety.

    Sixteen rice ears bred a high-quality variety, which greatly inspired and encouraged me, and helped me find a new direction for selecting and breeding good varieties: changing from looking for suitable good varieties from other places in the past to breeding more and better high-quality varieties through hybridization myself. Now I have bred high-quality varieties such as "Sloping Eight Stones Late". In order to breed more new varieties, we have set up a seed room in our cooperative, established seed comparison trial fields, and formed a seed research group, so that the scientific research work on seeds has developed into a mass movement, and can better concentrate the rich experience and knowledge accumulated by old and young farmers.

    Familiarize Yourself with the Temperaments of Various Varieties Utilize Their Strengths and Avoid Their Weaknesses
    Another autumn, I encountered a difficult question to answer: In August, two kinds of late rice, both good varieties, were planted on the same day, but at harvest, they yielded different harvests: "Black Mouth Glutinous" yielded 568 jin per mu, while "Dajing White" yielded only 292 jin. Since they are both good varieties, and the soil quality, fertilizer, and cultivation are roughly the same, why is there a difference of onefold in yield? Isn't this a strange phenomenon? After further research with the old farmers, I suddenly realized that the characteristics of the varieties had been ignored during cultivation. "Dajing White" has poor cold resistance and is not suitable for continuous cropping late rice, so the yield was reduced; "Black Mouth Glutinous" has strong cold resistance and is suitable for continuous cropping late rice, so the yield was increased.

    This incident was very enlightening to me. I realized that to increase production, it is not enough to simply do a good job in selecting and breeding good varieties, but it is necessary to further familiarize myself with the characteristics of each variety. Only with reasonable matching and adapting to local conditions can we give full play to the strengths of each variety and enable all good varieties to achieve high yields. For example, rice seeds from the south are more afraid of cold because the climate in the south is colder than here. This variety has very poor cold resistance and can only produce shriveled grains when planted as late rice, but it can produce a bumper harvest when planted as early rice; rice seeds from the north are just the opposite, because the north is colder than here, so they are more cold-resistant and mature earlier in the south, making them most suitable for late rice. For example, japonica rice requires sufficient base fertilizer, so it needs to be planted in fields with better soil quality; while indica rice is the opposite. In short, we must follow its temperament; if there is any improper arrangement, the result will be counterproductive. Based on this understanding, I focused on studying the performance of each variety. According to the different characteristics of climate, soil quality, fertility, cultivation level, and varieties, I found a set of rules for which ones to match with which ones, which ones are suitable for which seasons, and which ones are suitable for which soils. In this way, each variety can be used to its best advantage and give full play to the potential of seed selection to increase production.

    Good Seeds and Inferior Seeds Often Transform Each Other Constantly Cultivate and Constantly Eliminate
    Dealing with seeds for many years, I gradually discovered such an important rule: the quality of seeds is not constant, and good seeds and inferior seeds often transform each other. For example, "503" was originally a vigorously promoted good variety, but in recent years, the yield has been declining year by year, and the performance of the variety is gradually degenerating, and it has become the object of elimination this year. On the contrary, "Long Awn Late" was originally an inferior variety that was going to be eliminated, but after being hybridized with "Dwarf Foot Awn Mouth", it turned into a good variety. There are many similar examples. No good variety can remain a good variety forever unchanged. This further proves that it is very necessary to insist on annual seed selection. Only in this way can good varieties be developed in the constant struggle with weeds. This is the theoretical basis for seed selection.

    At the same time, I further discovered in my observation that the degeneration phenomenon of a variety is more obvious when it is planted in the same place and on the same land for a long time. But if it is changed to a new land or moved to a new place for cultivation, the opposite phenomenon will immediately occur, and the performance of the variety will rapidly improve. For example, "Nante No. 1" yielded 545 jin per mu in Luqiao, but after being transferred to Linhai, the yield reached 580 jin. The "Glutinous Beijing Rice" transferred from Wenling yielded 536 jin per mu in Luqiao, while the yield in the original Wenling was only 490 jin (the cultivation conditions were similar).

    Based on this rule, I proposed in the cooperative the establishment of a system for frequent exchange of varieties with other places, and the adoption of a cropping system in which various varieties are planted in rotation.

    The so-called good seeds and inferior seeds are not absolute. Some varieties themselves have not degenerated and can maintain the achieved yield level, and even increase the yield year by year, but due to the rapid development of the objective situation, the level of soil quality and fertility has improved, and advanced cultivation techniques have been adopted, etc., the performance of the original varieties can no longer meet the requirements of the yield target, so they can only be placed in the elimination list. Take "Nante No. 1" as an example. From the perspective of yield, it is also increasing year by year, and last year's yield of 600 jin per mu is generally not too low. However, because a "Lucai No. 1" has emerged that has developed the advantages of "Nante No. 1" and far exceeds it, in contrast, "Nante No. 1" has become an inferior variety and will be completely eliminated this year.

    Based on this rule, we have begun to systematically cultivate new varieties and eliminate old varieties. We cultivate several varieties and eliminate several varieties every year.

    Because I have a preliminary understanding and mastery of the law of seed transformation, I have also explored a set of methods for selecting and breeding good varieties - combining seed selection, exchanging good varieties with other places, cultivating local new varieties, eliminating old varieties, and rotating planting on the same land. Implementing this method can strive for perfection, select the best of the best, and improve the performance of varieties to a higher level.

    From my own experience, I deeply realize that practice is the mother of science. Our knowledge of the laws of seed development and change did not come from any books, but from our years of labor, through continuous observation, research, and practice. Without the practice of production, without going through the process of practice, understanding, and then practice, we would not be able to master the characteristics of seeds and the laws of their development and change. At the same time, from our practice, we have also realized that science is not something mysterious. As long as we break superstitions, dare to think, dare to do, work hard to research, and give play to the wisdom of the collective, farmers can also master science.

    实践是科学之母
    浙江黄岩县路桥一社社长兼党支部书记　杨匡保
    经过几年的努力，我社现在已选育出三十三种水稻良种，建立了种子田和种子对比试验田，组织了种子专业队、选种突击队、种子技术研究小组，大大推动了生产，水稻每亩平均产量从1954年的四百七十斤，提高到1957年的一千多斤，今年可达到二千多斤。我们还打算在明年建立种子社，供应全县二十万亩（占全县水稻五分之二）水稻所需的种子。下面谈谈我从根本不懂选种到逐步掌握了一些选种规律的过程。
    打破老习惯选种良种　粮食增了产信心更增
    土地改革以后，我参加了路桥第一个生产互助组，心头只有这么一个单纯的愿望：现在土地是自己的了，产量再高，地主也拿不去了。因此一定要响应党和政府的号召，把产量提得高些、再高些！
    就是这样一个单纯的愿望，促使我去积极寻找一切增产的关键。我整天寻思着，很自然地就想到了改良种子。
    于是，我就开始物色好谷种。有一次，偶然听到从台州农校来的学生谈起，农校有一种“五○三”稻种很好。第二天，我就赶去买了七斤回来。又一次，从石曲乡岙王村经过，在一个农民的田头看到一种叫“粗秆白”的稻子长得很好，也买了二十斤谷种回来。
    培育外来的新品种，这在祖祖辈辈都种着同样几种老品种的农民看来，真是不可理解的事情。
    因为怕人笑话，我就一个人躲在屋里一粒一粒地选谷种，过春节也没有出门。不巧给一个有保守思想的人闯见了。他到处传播这种“新闻”，拿话挖苦我，闹得同一个互助组的人那时也不敢同我合作了。
    我只好单干。下种以后整天在田头上守着秧，插秧时，互助组还是不帮忙。
    插完秧，我心里很急，早晨、黄昏不知要跑多少趟田头。田里的情况没有叫我失望：新品种“五○三”长得很顺利。
    可是到了6月26日，人家的稻子都已收割完毕，而“五○三”只熟了60％。据气象台预报，27日就要有大风大雨，只好马上抢收。就是这样，“五○三”每亩还是收了三百六十五斤，比“广东白”多收九十五斤。
    晚稻种上了新品种“粗秆白”。种下去就长得很粗壮，秆子笔直，稻叶也清爽，还不怕病虫害和稻热病。有保守思想的人看了也不能不点头说好。
    “粗秆白”每亩收了四百四十斤，比别的品种多收六十六斤。收割后，人家都来跟我换种。
    从此，我对种子就更像着了迷一样。只要打听到哪里有良种，就饭也吃不下，觉也睡不好，总要想办法把它弄来。
    大胆改革耕作制度　早稻晚稻都告丰收
    1952年的初步成就对于我来说是一个重要的开始。
    这一年，我们互助组订了一个亩产七百五十斤的生产指标。指标比人家高得多。我们在考虑如何实现这个指标时，认为光靠推广选育新品种是不够的，还得开辟新的道路。新的道路在哪里呢？
    间作，是这里祖祖辈辈传下来的老方法。这种耕作方法最大的缺点是不能密植（亩插仅七千株），土地利用率很低，已成为增产的主要障碍。这时，我就想：是不是可以把晚稻插秧的时间推迟，等早稻收割完毕再插；这样，早稻的株数就可以由七千株增加到一万六千株。根据增加的株数推算，产量至少可以增加50％。采用这种办法，早稻增产是不成问题的，可是晚稻插秧推迟两个月行不行呢？对于这个问题，我马上找到了答案。我想起每年收割早稻后，因为有些晚稻已经死了，总要在间作稻田里补上部分晚秧，这些补插的晚稻不是一样长得很好，并不影响收成吗？既然补种的能行，为什么全部晚插不行呢？于是我决心在自己的一亩三分田里进行试验。
  我要种连作稻的事情，又遭到了有保守思想的人的反对。有的人对我说：“你是想当模范想得着迷啦！种得这么密，准要倒伏。”我没有理会这些。
    我对早稻没有什么耽心。果然早稻每亩收了五百八十斤，比人家多收三百斤。但是我耽心晚稻。万一秋后西北风一刮，不结穗怎么办？
    晚稻插下四、五天了，人家间作晚稻已有一尺五高了，我的才三、四寸，颜色也真难看，有人说：“稻秆筷样长，满田喂牛草！”我埋着头加紧施肥和耘田，耘了五遍，稻子就慢慢赶上来了。过了秋分，人家的稻子已抽穗了，我的稻秆还是瘪的。连去看了四、五天，剥开秆子看，还是什么也没有。人家又在我的耳边叫：“赶快喂黄牛算了，反正你家养着大黄牛。”听了真叫人心烦！
    心虽烦，可是信心没有动摇。我想：搞一定要坚决搞下去，坚持下去就能胜利。要是失败就再来。又过了三天，我又去田头，顺手拔一根剥开来一看，咳，出穗了！简直有些不相信自己的眼睛，心里说不出的高兴。第二天，大部稻子出了穗，十天后稻穗都沉甸甸地垂下了头。
    互助组全部人员都来帮助收割。收好后，一称亩产四百四十六斤，加上早稻五百八十斤，一共是一千零二十六斤。有保守思想的人在事实面前不得不信服了。收割的谷子又被大家换去做种子。
    年年选种大大增产　运用杂交培育新种
    1954年办起了初级社。良种能增产，已成为大家公认的事实。但是对坚持年年选种、搞种子田的一套，思想抵触还很多。
    我决定再用事实来说服他们，搞了几块经过穗选和未经穗选的对比田，然后组织社员们去参观并进行讨论。事实一摆就很清楚：同样的“乌嘴糯”稻种，经过穗选的就长得整齐得多，谷粒也饱满得多，一亩要多产五十五斤，“南特号”要多产三十七斤，“大荆白”要多产五十一斤。差得这么多！大家的心亮堂了。社员们编了一首赞扬的快板：“选稻种，好得很，长起稻头沉甸甸；又饱满，又鲜亮，一季能打千斤粮！”
    这年秋天，我在沉甸甸的一片稻浪中，忽然发现有几丛稻穗长得特别好，株高、秆粗、穗长，与众不同。我估计这是“乌嘴糯”同附近的“黄糯”杂交而成的，心里想：“要是糯稻都长得这好，那么产量不是要增加得许多许多吗！”
    收割时，我把其中最好的十六株拔了回来。第二年，在自己的秧田里划了一小丘，把这十六株稻穗都播了下去，再用稻草把它们团团围起。秋收时收了十多斤谷种，粒粒饱满，确是大有希望的谷种。于是年年单独选种，单独播种，苦心经营，年年扩大。今年，全社已有75％的田种上了这种新品种。
    经过几年精心培育，它的性能有了新的发展，产量要比原来的“乌嘴糯”高20％左右，抗寒能力很强，无稻热病，已成为出色的优良新品种。
    十六株稻穗培育出一种优良品种，给我极大的启发和鼓舞，使我找到了选育良种的新方向：由过去向外地寻找适宜的良种，改由自己通过杂交方法来培育更多更好的优良品种。现在我已经培育了“斜八石晚”等优良品种。为了培育出更多的新品种，我们社里设立了种子室，建立了种子对比试验田，并且组成种子研究小组，使种子的科学研究工作发展为群众性的行动，并能更好地集中老农民和青年农民所积累起来的丰富经验和知识。
    熟悉各种品种脾气　用其所长避其所短又是一个秋天，我遇到了一个难以回答的题目：就是在8月里同一天种下的两种都是良种的晚稻，到收割时，却得到了不同的收成：“乌嘴糯”亩产达五百六十八斤，而“大荆白”却只收了二百九十二斤。既然都是良种，土质、肥料、耕作也大致相同，为什么产量相差了一倍？这不是很奇怪的现象吗？和老农进一步研究后，才恍然大悟，原来在耕作时忽视了品种的特性。“大荆白”抗寒能力差，不适宜种连作晚稻，因此就减了产；“乌嘴糯”抗寒能力强，适宜作连作晚稻，因此就增了产。
    这件事给我启发很大。我认识到：要增产，光做好选育良种还不够，需要进一步熟悉每种品种的特性。只有合理搭配，因地制宜，才能充分发挥每个品种的特长，使所有的良种都能得到丰产。譬如南边来的稻种，因南边气候比这里冷得迟，这种品种就比较怕冷，抗寒能力很差，当晚稻种只能结瘪谷，当早稻种就能丰收；北边来的稻种恰恰相反，因为北边比这里冷，所以比较耐寒，在南方成熟期早，当晚稻种最适宜。又如粳稻，它要基肥足，因此需要种在土质较好的田里；而籼稻的情况则相反。总之，一定要顺着它的脾气；稍有安排不当，结果就会适得其反。在这样的认识基础上，我就专心致志地研究每个品种的性能。根据气候、土质、肥力、耕作水平和品种的不同特性，何者和何者搭配，何者适宜什么季节，何者适宜哪种土壤，都给找出了一套规律。这样就使各种品种各得其所，各尽所能，充分发挥选种增产的潜力。
    良种劣种常互相转化　要不断培育不断淘汰
    长年和种子打交道，逐渐发现这么一个重要的规律：种子的好坏并不是一成不变的，良种和劣种经常互相转化。例如“五○三”原是大力推广的良种，但是这几年来，产量年年下降，品种的性能正在逐渐退化，已成为今年淘汰的对象。相反的，“长芒晚”原来是准备淘汰的劣种，但是和“矮脚芒嘴”杂交后，却摇身一变而为良种了。类似这样的例子是很多的。没有一种良种可以一成不变地永远为良种。这就更加证明：很有必要坚持年年选种，只有这样，才能在和莠种不断斗争中使良种得到发展。这就是选种的理论根据。
    同时，我在观察中又进一步发现：一种品种长期种植在同一地方、同一块土地上，它的退化现象就更要明显些。但是如果把它换到一块新土地上种植，或迁到一个新的地方培育，又会马上发生完全相反的现象，品种的性能迅速提高。例如“南特号”在路桥亩产五百四十五斤，调到临海后，产量就达到五百八十斤。从温岭调来的“糯京稻”，在路桥亩产量达五百三十六斤，而在温岭原地时产量仅四百九十斤（耕作条件是相仿的）。
    根据这一规律，我就在社里提出了建立和外地经常交流品种的制度，和采用各种品种轮番种植的耕作制度。
    所谓良种和劣种也并不是绝对的。有些品种本身并没有退化，能够保持已达到的产量水平，甚至还能逐年增产，但是由于客观形势飞跃发展，土质、肥力水平有了提高，以及采用了先进的耕作技术等等原因，原有品种的性能已不能适应产量指标的要求，就只能把它排入淘汰之列。就拿“南特号”为例，从产量上看，它也是年年提高的，去年亩产六百斤，一般不算太低。但是因为出现了一种发展了“南特号”的优点、并远远超过它的“陆财号”，对比之下，“南特号”成为劣种，今年就要把它全部淘汰。
    根据这个规律，我们已开始有计划地培育新品种、淘汰旧品种。每年都要培育几种、淘汰几种。
    由于我初步认识和掌握了种子转化的规律，因此，我也就摸索出一套选育良种的办法——选种、和外地交流良种、培育本地新品种、淘汰老品种、在同一土地上轮番换种等几种方法相结合的方法。实行这个方法，就能精益求精，优中选优，把品种的性能提高到更高的水平上去。
    从我亲身的经验里，我深刻地体会到：实践是科学之母。关于种子发展变化的规律的知识，我们不是从什么书本上得来的，是从我们经年累月的劳动中，经过不断的观察、研究和实践而得来的。如果没有生产的实践，如果不经过实践、认识、再实践的过程，我们是不会掌握种子的特性和它的发展变化的规律的。同时，从我们的实践中，我们也认识到：科学并不是什么神秘的东西，只要我们打破迷信，敢想、敢干，努力研究，发挥集体的智慧，农民也是能够掌握科学的。
