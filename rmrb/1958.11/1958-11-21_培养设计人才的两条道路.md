    Two Paths for Cultivating Design Talent
    Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy and Electric Power

    The Party's educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor is entirely correct. Its implementation will fundamentally reform the education sector, enabling it to better adapt to the needs of socialist revolution and construction, as well as the transition to communism. The results of Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy and Electric Power integrating graduation design with production fully prove this point.

    In February 1958, based on the victories of the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, and inspired by the new situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture—especially in water conservancy—the CPC Committee of Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy and Electric Power and the Institute's administration decided to integrate the graduation design of graduating students with production. According to this decision, 237 students independently undertook the design tasks of 25 projects in more than three months, cooperated with production agencies to design 16 projects, and independently completed five special research projects. Of all the work completed, the engineering departments decided to adopt the 25 independently undertaken engineering design projects, and 22 of them are scheduled to begin construction this winter and next spring. The national economic benefits of these 22 projects after completion will be quite substantial, including: (1) Irrigating an area of 56,488,800 mu, approximately equal to one-quarter of China's total irrigated area over the past several thousand years before liberation; equivalent to four times the wheat planting area of major crops in the UK in 1956; equal to about one-half of the total un-irrigated cultivated land area in the five provinces where the projects are located; (2) The installed capacity of hydropower stations will reach 679,800 kilowatts, equivalent to 22 times that of the Guanting Hydropower Station; (3) The annual cargo volume of navigation projects will be 2,700,900 tons; (4) The flood control area will reach 5,304 square kilometers; (5) Pumping stations will have 37,870 horsepower; (6) Waterlogging drainage area will be 1,900,000 mu. In addition, the collaborative projects are not included in these figures. Such work achievements have played a significant role in directly promoting water conservancy construction.

    Achieving such fruitful results was not easy but went through a tortuous struggle between two paths and two methods. After the decision to integrate the graduation design of graduating students with production was proposed, some students expressed support, many were hesitant, and a few showed resistance. Among the teachers, only a minority approved, most expressed doubt, and a small number opposed it. Teachers and students who opposed, resisted, or doubted the integration of graduation design with production put forward various reasons. Among these reasons, the one they considered "most powerful" was that integrating graduation design with production would lower the quality of student training. The reasons given were: "The content of such graduation design is not complete or systematic"; "Students may not be able to use their time effectively during the design process, there may be more repetitive calculations and more rework"; "The guidance may be weaker, the technical personnel in the agencies may have a lower theoretical level, and the teachers in the schools may not be able to take care of everything everywhere"; and so on. The bourgeois teaching viewpoint that is detached from production reality formed a contradiction with the Party committee's decision under the guise of the so-called "quality" issue. At this time, the Party committee realized that the struggle between two lines and two ideologies was unavoidable. In order to establish an opposing example, the Party committee agreed to the following arrangement made by the department administration: the graduation design of 176 of the 237 graduating students would be integrated with production, while the other 61 students would still carry out the old-fashioned graduation design detached from reality. More than two months into the graduation design process, the advantages and disadvantages of the two different methods became more apparent. At this time, the 61 students who were constrained by the old-fashioned design were dissatisfied with their "work" and posted big-character posters, resolutely demanding a change in the design method to combine it with production, and they reflected this demand to the Party committee. The Party committee immediately agreed to their request, and some teachers also admitted their conservative ideas in the face of the facts. As a result, the graduation design of these 61 students also smoothly embarked on the correct path of integrating with production.

    Now, the graduation design combined with production has been basically completed, and a mass summary has been conducted. What were the results? Compared with graduation design detached from reality, did the graduation design combined with production improve or lower the quality of student training?

    In the past, when conducting design detached from reality, students often "worked late into the night," "thought hard," and were "conscientious." However, what was the purpose of the design? What were they responsible for? Analysis reveals that it was nothing more than: First, being responsible for getting a grade of "five" for themselves. To achieve this goal, despite some major shortcomings and errors in the design, they could avoid reworking and instead try to "cover up" or "defend" them (in fact, students often prepared, under the "guidance" of teachers, how to "defend" the shortcomings and errors in the design results during the graduation design defense); but they spent a lot of effort on the drawings to add a shaded perspective view of construction machinery, which was completely unnecessary, to make the drawings "look better"; or they tried every means to make the description longer. Second, being responsible for their own interests. Since the design was not intended for practical use anyway, they could do whatever they liked. Third, being responsible for the preferences of the guiding teacher. This was related to being responsible for getting a grade of "five" for themselves. The students knew very well that if they could cater to the preferences of the guiding teacher in the design, they would have a greater chance of getting a grade of "five."

    In the graduation design combined with production, the situation was completely different. This type of design was to be used locally as a basis for actual water conservancy construction. In fact, the vast majority of the graduation designs completed this time are to be implemented this winter. The students understood very well that their design must be responsible to the socialist cause and to the people. Some students said, "This is the first time I have contributed my skills to serve the people, and I should make a good start." With a sense of pride and ownership in their thinking, they were able to consciously make the design results conform as much as possible to the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical, and they would not allow mistakes to occur. Many students proposed, "We should be responsible for the results of our design to the end." During the design process, there were indeed many instances of rework, but this rework did not affect the "effective use of time" at all. On the contrary, this rework not only tempered the students' communist qualities but also improved their scientific and technological level. In the design of a ship lock connecting the Yangtze River and Lake Wu (near Hankou), the lock was initially designed as reinforced concrete based on dogma, with an estimated cost of more than one million yuan. Faced with this design, the local government and people said, "The design is good, but it is too expensive, and we cannot build it." This was both a blow and a dose of sobriety for the students. They immediately reviewed their design ideas, held discussions, and sent people to the site to further understand the local material situation. Finally, they decided to completely change their design, abandon the original reinforced concrete plan, and adopt a new masonry plan, which reduced the cost to hundreds of thousands of yuan and saved the state a large amount of steel and cement. At the same time, they also made some new creations in technology.

    One method of graduation design cultivates students to develop towards the path of bourgeois individualism; another method of graduation design cultivates students to develop towards the path of proletarian collectivism.

    Bourgeois teachers often boast that graduation design detached from reality is an effective way to "cultivate students' independent working ability." However, this "independent working ability" is essentially only the ability to use formulas from books to solve hypothetical "practical problems." People with this "independent working ability" often have no independent working ability in the face of production reality. Conversely, graduation design combined with production can truly cultivate students' independent working ability.

    To assess the independent working ability of engineering and technical personnel, the first thing to consider is whether they are good at understanding the Party's policies. People who are ignorant of policies have no independent working ability to speak of, even if they have learned to use formulas. Graduation design combined with production just promotes students to deeply understand the Party's policies. In the water conservancy construction industry, the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, the policy of combining large, medium, and small, the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and the policy of focusing on storage, community management, and small-scale projects in farmland water conservancy work must all be carefully reflected in the design. Otherwise, the design results will not meet the needs of the country and the people and will only become a pile of waste paper. For example, in the design of a certain canal line, there are two options: one, the canal line is longer, with more earth and stone work; the other, the canal line is shorter, with less earth and stone work, but requires the addition of a pumping station. The calculated project cost is higher for the former than for the latter. Faced with these two options, an academic designer might choose the latter because it is both "modern" and "economical." However, if the local government and farmers are allowed to choose, they will definitely choose the former because excavating earth and stone work can be done with certainty, and the actual cost required is not as expensive as calculated on paper; on the other hand, setting up a pumping station will inevitably cost more money, and there is even no guarantee that it can be purchased within the expected time frame. Such a problem is essentially a technical policy issue. Students must and can deeply understand technical policies in the graduation design combined with production and, through the understanding of technical policies, connect with the wishes of the masses and the objective reality in their thinking. In fact, all of the Party's policies reflect the wishes of the broad masses and the objective reality. I ask: is it possible to obtain this kind of training in understanding policies in a virtual design?

    The independent working ability of a technical cadre should also be assessed based on whether they are good at acquiring existing data, collecting missing data, and analyzing and processing data using scientific viewpoints and methods. In virtual design, the "original data" is originally artificially created, just as the conditions in arithmetic problems for elementary school students are pre-set by the teacher. If any "data" is found to be lacking during the design process, it can be arbitrarily assumed and supplemented; if any conditions are found to be not to one's liking, they can be arbitrarily modified. People who do not like designing earth dams can assume that "there is no soil suitable for building earth dams locally." People who like to make reinforced concrete structures can assume that "the construction site happens to be adjacent to a large steel factory." In a word: not starting from the actual situation but from subjective wishes. From this point alone, it can be seen that the "completeness" and "systematicness" mentioned by bourgeois teachers have no practical significance. In graduation design combined with production, students have to seriously collect data and seriously analyze and process data. Almost no design is started before first conducting on-site surveys, asking the masses, or supplementing measurement work. In data analysis, students learn to distinguish between the main contradictions and secondary contradictions of things and to make the resolution of secondary contradictions subject to the resolution of main contradictions. It is not difficult to see how this kind of training will help promote students to establish a scientific dialectical materialist viewpoint in the business field. Virtual design can only cultivate subjectivism. In the fundamental issue of worldview, the two also form a sharp contrast.

    In the graduation design combined with production, students also realize that the exertion of individual independent working ability is based on the full exertion of collective strength. To carry out any actual water conservancy engineering design, it is necessary to obtain full cooperation with relevant units and relevant personnel. People engaged in hydraulic structure design must promptly understand the conditions of construction; conversely, people engaged in construction design must also understand the design of hydraulic structures. The better the cooperation, the more conducive it is to the exertion of individual independent working ability. If one closes the door and relies solely on one's own intelligence to carry out the design, the result will inevitably be incompatible with the whole, and rework will inevitably be caused. It is naturally very important for the younger generation of technical workers to cultivate a mass viewpoint and a collective viewpoint in business work. However, in virtual design, there is no opportunity for this kind of training. In that case, his work is 100% "independent," so what he needs is not cooperation but only to close the door and indulge in fantasy alone, simply circling in the small world of personal thinking, sometimes complacent and sometimes discouraged. If it is said that this can also cultivate "independent working ability," then this "independent working ability" becomes a valueless illusion as soon as it comes into contact with reality, with the collective, and with the masses. From this graduation design combined with production, the students deeply realized that only practice, the masses, and the collective are the inexhaustible source of individual wisdom.

    Students engaged in graduation design combined with production naturally also need to have the independent working ability to use the necessary formulas to perform the necessary calculations and to use the necessary scientific and technological theories to analyze and process specific problems. However, it is very inappropriate to limit the cultivation of independent working ability to a narrow scope, as bourgeois teachers advocate. Moreover, even within this scope, the training that students receive in design combined with production is more profound compared to that in virtual design. The former requires the application of scientific and technological theories and calculation formulas in living practical situations and conditions; while the latter only applies them in simple, rigid, and virtual conditions. There is a qualitative difference between the two. Which method can cultivate students' true independent working ability, is it not obvious?

    The last trump card of teachers who oppose and doubt the integration of production in graduation design is: according to their argument, this method may play a role in cultivating students' "redness," but there are major problems in cultivating students' "expertise." However, the facts have given a resounding rebuttal to these opponents and doubters.

    Precisely because graduation design combined with production has a very clear purpose, students clearly recognize that their design results will have an effect in water conservancy construction, thus greatly increasing their sense of responsibility, initiative, and creativity in their work. Therefore, there is a great improvement in the scientific and technological level. This is beyond the reach of virtual design. This is not only because the old-fashioned fake design has forged an immutable framework in terms of purpose, requirements, design methods, and design steps, which cannot but restrict the exertion of creativity. More importantly, it is because fake design induces people engaged in work to drill into the small circle of bourgeois individualism, which not only fails to exert collective strength but also hinders the exertion of individual creativity. It can be clearly seen from here that bourgeois individualism is always associated with stagnation, backwardness, and ignorance. This is true in politics, and it is also true in science and technology.

    The iron-like facts prove that integrating production into graduation design will greatly and comprehensively improve students' quality of being both red and expert, rather than reducing quality. None of the various arguments put forward by the opposition and doubters can stand up to the facts.

    Two different methods of graduation design take two different paths and yield two essentially different results. Graduation design detached from reality will cultivate "talents" who are bourgeois individualistic, subjectivist, and unable to solve practical problems in science and technology; graduation design combined with production will cultivate talents who are proletarian collectivist, good at starting from reality, and dare to think and act in science and technology.

    培养设计人才的两条道路
    武汉水利学院
    党提出的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针是完全正确的，它的贯彻执行，将从本质上改革教育事业，使之更好地适应社会主义革命和建设以及向共产主义过渡的需要。武汉水利学院结合生产进行毕业设计的结果，完全证明此点。
    1958年2月，在整风运动和反右派斗争取得胜利的基础上，在全国工农业大跃进——特别是水利事业大跃进的新形势的鼓舞下，中共武汉水利学院委员会和院行政决定将应届毕业学生的毕业设计结合生产进行。根据这一决定，二百三十七名学生在三个多月的时间内独立承担了二十五项工程的设计任务，协同生产机关进行了十六项工程的设计任务，独立完成了五项专题研究工作。所完成的全部工作中，独立承担的二十五项工程设计项目为工程机关决定采用，而且要在今冬明春施工者计有二十二项。这二十二项工程建成后，国民经济效益相当巨大，计：（1）灌溉面积五千六百四十八万八千亩，约等于解放前几千年来我国灌溉总面积的四分之一；相当于1956年英国主要作物小麦播种面积的四倍；等于各工程所在五省全部尚未灌溉的耕地面积的二分之一左右；（2）水电站装机容量达六十七万九千八百瓩，相当于官厅水电站的二十二倍；（3）航运工程的年货运量二百七十万九千吨；（4）防洪面积达五千三百零四平方公里；（5）抽水机站三万七千八百七十马力；（6）排渍面积一百九十万亩。此外，协同完成者不计在内。这样的工作成果在直接促进水利建设事业方面起了巨大作用。
    这样丰硕成果的取得，并不轻易，而是经历了两条道路、两种方法的曲折斗争的。应届毕业生的毕业设计结合生产进行的决定提出后，在学生中，一部分人表示拥护，不少的人犹豫不决，个别的人表现出抵触情绪；在教师中，赞成的只是少数，大多数人表示怀疑，一小部分人持反对态度。对结合生产进行毕业设计抱着反对态度、抵触情绪和怀疑态度的教师与学生，提出各式各样的理由。在这些理由中，他们认为“最有力量”的一条是：结合生产进行毕业设计会降低培养学生的质量。原因是：“这样的毕业设计，在内容上不是完整的、有系统的”；“同学们在设计中，不易有效利用时间，重复的计算可能较多，返工可能较多”；“指导力量会较弱，机关里的技术人员理论水平可能较差，而学校里的教师又不易到各处照顾”；等等。脱离生产实际的资产阶级教学观点，便在所谓“质量”问题的掩盖下，与党委的决定形成对立。此时，党委看出，两条路线、两种思想的斗争是不可避免的。为了树立对立面，党委同意系行政所作如下安排：二百三十七个应届毕业学生中的一百七十六人的毕业设计结合生产进行，另外六十一人仍进行老一套的脱离实际的毕业设计。到毕业设计进行了两个多月以后，两种不同方式的好坏优劣，已比较明显。这时，被束缚于老一套的设计中的六十一个同学不满意于自己的“工作”了，贴出大字报，坚决要求改变设计方式，结合生产，并将这个要求反映给党委。党委立即同意他们的要求，某些教师在事实面前也承认自己有保守思想，于是这六十一个同学的毕业设计也顺利地走上结合生产的正确道路。
    现在结合生产的毕业设计已基本完成，进行了群众性的总结。结果怎样呢？与脱离实际的毕业设计比较起来，结合生产的毕业设计究竟是提高了还是降低了培养学生的质量？
    过去，在进行脱离实际的设计中，同学们也常常“开夜车”“苦思苦想”，“认真负责”。然而设计的目的性何在呢？对什么负责呢？分析起来，不外：第一、对自己得五分负责。为了达到这个目的，尽管对设计中的某些重大缺点和错误，可以不去返工，而设法“掩盖”或“辩解”过去（事实上，学生常常在教师的“指导下”，准备在毕业设计答辩中如何为设计成果中的缺点与错误“辩护”）；但是在图纸中却花费许多力量完全不必要的添上一幅施工机械的带阴影的透视图，使图纸“更好看一些”；或者，想尽办法将说明书写得更长一些。第二、对自己的兴趣负责。由于设计反正是不用于实践的，自己高兴怎样作，便怎样作。第三、对指导教师的爱好负责。这与对自己得五分负责是相联系的。同学们知道得很清楚，如果在设计中能投指导教师之所好，得五分的机会就会更多一些。
    在结合生产的毕业设计中，情况便完全两样。这种设计，是要拿到当地据以实际从事水利建设的。事实上，这次所完成的绝大多数毕业设计，都是在今年冬天就要施工的。同学们了解得很清楚：他们的设计，必须对社会主义事业负责，对人民负责。有的同学说：“这是我第一次贡献自己的技术为人民服务，应该把这个头起好。”在思想上有自豪感和主人翁感，因而能够自觉地使设计成果尽可能符合多快好省的原则，更不允许出错误。不少的同学提出：“应该对我们的设计结果负责到底。”在设计过程中，确实出现了不少的返工现象，但这种返工，绝非影响“有效利用时间”。恰恰相反，在这种返工中，既锻炼了同学们的共产主义品质，也提高了科学技术水平。在沟通长江与武湖（汉口附近）的一座船闸的设计中，开始的时候，从教条出发，把船闸设计成钢筋混凝土的，工程费需一百余万元。面对这个设计，当地政府和人民表示：“设计好是好，只是太贵，我们不能建筑。”这对同学说来，既是当头一棒，也是一服清醒剂。他们马上对自己的设计思想进行检查，展开讨论，并派人到现场进一步了解当地材料的情况。最后决定彻底改变自己的设计，放弃钢筋混凝土的原方案，改用砌石的新方案，使工程费降低到几十万元，并为国家节省大量钢材和水泥。同时，在技术上还作了一些新的创造。
    一种方式的毕业设计，培养同学们向资产阶级个人主义的道路发展；另一种方式的毕业设计，培养同学们向无产阶级集体主义的道路发展。
    资产阶级的教师们常常吹嘘脱离实际的毕业设计是“培养学生独立工作能力”的有效方式。但这种“独立工作能力”，实质上只是运用书本中的公式，去解答假设中的“实际问题”的能力。具有这种“独立工作能力”的人，在生产实际面前，却往往是毫无独立工作能力的。相反地，从结合生产的毕业设计中，却能真正培养学生的独立工作能力。
    作为工程技术人员的独立工作能力如何，首先要看他在工作中是否善于体会党的方针政策。昧于方针政策的人，尽管学会了运用公式，是毫无独立工作能力可言的。结合生产进行毕业设计，刚好促进了同学深入体会党的方针政策。在水利建设事业中，多快好省的方针，大中小结合的方针，土洋并举的方针，农田水利工作中以蓄为主、社办为主、小型为主的方针等等，都必须在设计中认真体现出来。否则，设计成果便不符合国家和人民的需要，只能成为一束废纸。例如在某条渠线的设计中，有两种方案：其一，渠线较长，土石方较多；另一，渠线较短，土石方较少，但须添设一座抽水站。计算出的工程费用，前者较后者为高。面对这两种方案，学院式的设计者，可能会选择后一种，因为它既“近代化”又“经济”。但是，如果让当地政府和农民去选择，肯定会挑前一种，因为开挖土石方是有把握办到的，所需的实际费用并不似纸面上计算出的那样昂贵；反之，设置抽水机站，倒是非多花钱不可的，甚至于还无把握在预期的时限内购得。像这样问题，实质上是一个技术政策问题。同学们在结合生产的毕业设计中，必须也有可能深入体会技术政策，并通过技术政策的体会，与群众的愿望和客观实际，在思想深处联系起来。事实上，党的方针政策，无一不是反映广大群众的愿望和客观实际的。试问：这种体会方针政策的锻炼，在虚拟的设计中，哪有可能得到呢？
    一个技术干部的独立工作能力如何，还应该看他是否善于占有已有的资料、收集缺乏的资料以及用科学的观点和方法去分析处理资料。在虚拟的设计中，“原始资料”本来都是人工创造的，正像小学生做算术题时，题里面的条件都是老师预先设定的一样。在设计过程中如果发现缺乏什么“资料”，可以任意假设补充；如果发现有什么条件不对自己的胃口，也可以随意加以修改。不喜欢设计土坝的人，可以假定“当地并无适于建土坝的土壤”。喜欢作钢筋混凝土建筑物的人，可以假定“工地恰好与一个大钢厂毗邻”。一句话：不是从实际情况出发，而是从主观愿望出发。仅从这一点，也可看出资产阶级教师所说的“完整”、“有系统”是没有任何实际意义的。在结合生产的毕业设计中，学生便不得不认真地收集资料，严肃地分析处理资料。几乎没有一个设计，在动手之前，不是先到现场查勘，向群众询问，或者补作测量工作的。在资料分析中，同学们学会了区别事物的主要矛盾与次要矛盾，让次要矛盾的解决服从于主要矛盾的解决。不难看出，这种锻炼将多么有利于促使同学在业务领域中建立辩证唯物主义的科学观点。而虚拟的设计却只能培养主观主义。在宇宙观这个根本问题上，二者也形成尖锐的对比。
    在结合生产的毕业设计中，同学们还体会到个人独立工作能力的发挥，是以集体力量的充分发挥作基础的。进行任何一项实际的水利工程设计，都必须与有关单位和有关的人员取得充分的协作。从事水工建筑物设计的人，不能不及时了解施工方面的条件；反之，从事施工设计的人，也不能不了解水工建筑物的设计情况。协作搞得愈好，便愈有利于个人独立工作能力的发挥，如果关起门来，单凭一个人的聪明才智去搞设计，所得到的结果，必然会与整体格格不入，不可避免地将造成返工。在业务工作中锻炼群众观点和集体观点，对于年青一代的技术工作者来说自然是十分重要的。然而，在虚拟的设计中，这种锻炼的机会是没有的，在那种情况下，他的工作是百分之百“独立的”，因而他所需要的不是协作，而只是关起门来，独个想入非非，单纯地在个人思维的小天地中兜圈子，时而沾沾自喜，时而灰心丧气。假若说这样也能培养“独立工作能力”的话，则这种“独立工作能力”一接触实际，一接触集体，一接触群众，便成为不值一文的幻影。从这次结合生产的毕业设计中，同学们深深体会到，只有实际、群众和集体才是个人智慧的无尽泉源。
    同学们从事结合生产的毕业设计，自然同样需要具备运用必要的公式去作必要的计算以及运用必要的科学技术理论去分析处理具体问题的独立工作能力。然而，如果将独立工作能力的培养限制在狭窄的范围里面，像资产阶级教师所主张的那样，就很不恰当了。何况就在这个范围里面，同学们在结合生产的设计中与在虚拟的设计中比较起来，所受到的锻炼，也是更加深刻的。前者，要求在活生生的实际情况和条件中去运用科学技术理论和计算公式；而后者却只是在简单的死板的虚拟条件下去运用它们。二者是有质的不同的。究竟哪一种方式能够培养学生的真正的独立工作能力，难道不是很明显吗？
    反对以及怀疑结合生产进行毕业设计的教师们，在“质量”问题上的最后一张王牌是：按照他们的论点，这种方式，如果对于培养学生的“红”来说也许会起点作用的话，对于培养学生的“专”来说，就大成问题。可是事实却给这些反对派与怀疑派以响亮的驳斥。
    正由于结合生产的毕业设计，目的性很明确，同学们清楚地认识到自己的设计成果在水利建设中即将发生作用，因而大大地提高了工作中的责任感，积极性和创造性。因而，在科学技术水平上有很大的提高。这是虚拟的设计所望尘莫及的。这不仅由于老一套的假设计无论在目的要求上，设计方法和设计步骤上都铸就了一个一成不变的死框框，不能不束缚创造性的发挥。更重要的是由于假设计诱使从事工作的人钻入资产阶级个人主义的小圈子中，既不能发挥集体力量，也妨碍了个人的创造性的发挥。从这里也可以清楚地看出：资产阶级个人主义总是与促退、落后和愚昧相联系的。在政治上是如此，在科学技术上也是如此。
    铁一般的事实证明了结合生产进行毕业设计会大大地全面地提高同学们又红又专的质量，而不是降低质量。反对派与怀疑派所提出的各式各样的论点，在事实面前，无一条是站得住脚的。
    两种不同的毕业设计的方式，走着两条不同的道路，得出两种在本质上不同的结果。脱离实际的毕业设计将培养出资产阶级个人主义的、主观主义的、在科学技术上不能解决实际问题的“人才”；结合生产的毕业设计将培养出无产阶级集体主义的，善于从实际出发的，在科学技术上敢想敢作的人才。
