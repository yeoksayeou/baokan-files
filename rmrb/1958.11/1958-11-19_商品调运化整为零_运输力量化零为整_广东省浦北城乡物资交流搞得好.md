Guangzhou Dispatch: In the midst of the Great Purchasing and Great Sales campaign, the commercial departments of Pubei County, Guangdong Province, created an advanced working method of "breaking down bulk commodity transfers into smaller units, and integrating fragmented transportation resources," enabling the timely transfer of large quantities of agricultural and sideline products from this mountainous area with inconvenient transportation, as well as industrial products transferred from the city to the countryside. They overfulfilled this year's purchasing plan more than fifty days ahead of schedule.

In the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, Pubei County found itself with a serious shortage of labor and transportation capacity. Large quantities of agricultural and sideline products needed to be sold from the countryside but could not be transported out, and the various industrial products urgently needed by the countryside could not be supplied in a timely manner. During the Great Purchasing and Great Sales campaign, the Zhanghuang and Shouxu transportation transit stations, where commodity transfers were most concentrated in the county, adopted the method of breaking down bulk commodity transfers into smaller units. The purchasing and sales departments under each station were responsible for picking up and transporting entire batches of goods themselves, dividing the task of transferring entire batches of goods among the various purchasing and sales departments, with each responsible for its own transportation. The transit station was only responsible for the transfer procedures. Each supply point quickly found transportation tools and manpower, and in one night transported all the goods to each supply point for timely supply. When these supply points came to pick up these goods, they also brought agricultural and sideline products from various places along the way.

In solving the problem of insufficient transportation capacity, Pubei County paid attention to utilizing fragmented and small-scale transportation resources, proposing the method of "seizing opportunities when vehicles are empty and carrying goods along the way," ensuring that no vehicle ran empty on the road, and achieving "carrying as much as possible, even a few dozen pounds is not too little."

Another method used by Pubei County to solve the difficulty of transferring agricultural products was "integrating fragmented transportation resources." They organized previously dispersed transportation tools and manpower into transportation teams. The county commercial department established a transportation company, and each station established platoons or squads, using bicycles, handcarts, horse-drawn carts, etc., for short-distance transportation within the county, transferring from one station to another in a relay.

### 商品调运化整为零  运输力量化零为整  广东省浦北城乡物资交流搞得好

    商品调运化整为零  运输力量化零为整
    广东省浦北城乡物资交流搞得好
    本报广州电　广东省浦北县商业部门在大购大销运动中，创造了一套“商品调运化整为零，运输力量化零为整”的先进工作方法，使这个交通不便的山区出产的大量农副产品和由城市调往农村的工业品得到及时调运，提前五十多天超额完成了今年的采购计划。
    浦北县在工农业生产大跃进中，劳动力和运输力量都显得非常不足，农村需要出售的大量农副产品运不出去，农村迫切需要的各种工业品也得不到及时供应。在大购大销运动中，这个县的张黄、守墟两个商品调运最集中的运输中转站，采取商品调运化整为零的方法，整批商品由各所属购销部门自提、自运，把整批商品的调运任务由各购销部分担，各自负责运输，中转站只负责转交手续。各供应点很快就找到了运输工具和人力，一天晚上就将商品全部调运到各供应点及时供应。这些供应点在前来接运这些商品时，还都顺路带来了各处的农副产品。
    浦北县在解决运输力量不足问题中，注意到了利用零星小量的运输力量，提出“遇空就抓，顺路带货”的办法，不让一辆车子在公路上空跑，而且做到“能带多少就多少，几十斤也不嫌少”。
    浦北县解决农产品调运困难的另一个办法是“运输力量化零为整”，将过去分散的运输工具和人力组成运输队伍，县商业部门成立运输连，各站成立排或班，用单车、手推车、马车等进行县内短途运输，一站转一站，接连运输。
