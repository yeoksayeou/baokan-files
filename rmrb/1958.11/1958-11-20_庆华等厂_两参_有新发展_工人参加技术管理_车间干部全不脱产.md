Our correspondent Kang Weizhong and Wang Baoxin report from Qiqihar on the 19th: The state-owned Qinghua Tool Factory, which created the experience of "Two Participations, One Reform," as well as the Jianhua Machinery Factory and the Hua'an Machinery Factory, have made some new and important developments in implementing "Two Participations." The production and management work of these factories has taken on a new look.

On the basis of workers participating in daily group management, these three factories have developed to the point where they participate in design and in the formulation of plans. Workers' participation in management has gradually developed from participating in production management to participating in the comprehensive management of production, finance, and technology. Workers at the Jianhua and Hua'an factories have directly participated in the design of everything from gauges and measuring tools to simple machine tools through "Academies of Sciences" (scientific research organizations created by the masses themselves). After participating in design, workers in each group of the eighth workshop of the Jianhua Machinery Factory designed and created new products such as flat block grinding machines, cast iron turning tools, and small simple rocking grinding machines in just one month. At present, workers throughout the factory have designed and manufactured more than 300 simple lathes themselves. In terms of planning work, these factories have changed the past practice of relying only on a few people in the office to compile plans, and have delegated the right to compile plans to the groups, with the workshops only issuing reference targets and providing drawings and materials. The groups formulate production schedules and processes according to the overall work progress, and implement long-term plans with short-term arrangements. This has greatly promoted the production enthusiasm and creativity of the groups.

On the basis of workers participating in group management, the Jianhua Machinery Factory has implemented new systems such as workers taking and sending tools and materials themselves, using and taking labor protection supplies themselves, and calculating and taking wages themselves. This practice improves the quality of management and facilitates production.

Comprehensively strengthening the work of production groups is a concentrated manifestation of the consolidation and development of "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations." These three factories have all adjusted the cadres of the groups, expanded the powers of the groups, and strengthened the Party's leadership over the groups. The groups have developed from purely production units to grassroots units for carrying out political work, production management, and arranging the lives of employees. The Jianhua Machinery Factory has also implemented a four-responsibility system within the groups, namely: responsibility for production, responsibility for management, responsibility for ideology, and responsibility for life.

In terms of cadres participating in labor, the cadres of these three factories have developed from participating in labor at fixed times and fixed positions in the past to participating in labor at any time and at any position, and have combined cadres' participation in labor with cultivating experimental plots. This facilitates the implementation of the policy of cadres' labor training, ensures the cadres' labor time, and facilitates participation in production and leadership of production. In addition to attending meetings convened by the factory's leading organs and handling affairs that must be handled without leaving production, all the cadres of the sixth workshop of the Hua'an Machinery Factory participate in production labor for the rest of the time; they go wherever there are difficulties, and they adopt the method of combining leading cadres, technicians, and the masses to cultivate experimental plots to solve key production problems. In September, their task of producing diesel engines was 200 units, and only 102 units were completed by the 25th. The workshop branch analyzed the key to production and believed that in order to complete the production task, it was necessary to immediately improve the production capacity of the assembly group. Therefore, the workshop leaders and technicians formed a group and went deep into the assembly group to cultivate experimental plots, which resulted in the overfulfillment of the task for that month.

The Qinghua Tool Factory has also absorbed some workers to form amateur functional groups with the original cadres who did not participate in production as the core, to take charge of various management tasks in the workshop. The relevant functional personnel only take two or three days to concentrate on handling business matters at the beginning or end of the month when business work is tight. In this way, all the workshop cadres do not leave production and directly participate in production and lead production. After the factory implemented the practice of workshop cadres not leaving production, the factory-level departments were also merged accordingly, and the original 13 departments were merged into four offices, and the functional personnel became "all-rounders." Therefore, the number of cadres who did not participate in production in the factory decreased from 4.8% of the total number of employees to 2%. On the basis of "Two Participations, One Reform," the Jianhua and Hua'an factories have also begun to try out a system of rotation between cadres and workers.

### 庆华等厂“两参”有新发展  工人参加技术管理　车间干部全不脱产

    庆华等厂“两参”有新发展
    工人参加技术管理　车间干部全不脱产
    本报齐齐哈尔19日电　记者康伟中、王宝馨报道：创造“两参一改”经验的国营庆华工具厂以及建华机械厂、华安机械厂，在实行“两参”方面有一些新的重要发展。这些厂的生产和管理工作又出现了新面貌。
    这三个厂的工人在参加小组日常管理的基础上，发展到参加设计，参加制定计划。工人参加管理已经由参加生产管理逐步发展为参加生产、财务、技术等方面的全面管理。建华、华安两厂的工人通过“科学院”（群众自己创造的科学研究组织）活动，直接参加了从工卡量具到简易机床的设计。建华机械厂八车间各小组的工人在参加设计以后，仅一个月的时间，就设计和创造出平面块规研磨机、铸铁车刀和小型简易摇头磨床等新产品。现在，全厂工人自己设计制造的简易车床已经有三百多台。在计划工作方面，这些厂改变了过去只靠少数人在办公室里编制计划的作法，把编制计划的权利下放到小组，车间只下达参考指标，供给图纸和材料。小组根据总作业进度编制生产进度和工艺，实行长计划短安排。这样，就大大发挥了小组的生产积极性和创造性。
    建华机械厂在工人参加小组管理的基础上，实行了工人自取自送工具、材料，自用自取自管劳动保护用品，自算自取工资等新制度。这种作法既提高了管理质量，又便利了生产。
    全面加强生产小组的工作，是“两参一改三结合”巩固、发展的集中表现。这三个厂都调整了小组的干部，扩大了小组的职权，加强了党对小组的领导。小组已经由单纯的生产单位发展成进行政治工作、进行生产管理和安排职工生活的基层单位。建华机械厂还在小组内实行了四包制度，即：包生产，包管理，包思想，包生活。
    在干部参加劳动方面，这三个厂的干部都由过去的固定时间、固定岗位参加劳动，发展到不固定时间和不固定岗位随时参加劳动，并把干部参加劳动和种试验田结合起来。这样既便于贯彻干部劳动锻炼的方针，也保证了干部的劳动时间，便于参加生产领导生产。华安机械厂六车间的干部除参加厂领导机关召开的会议，处理必须脱产处理的事务以外，其余全部时间都参加生产劳动；他们参加劳动，哪里有困难就到哪里去，并且采用领导干部、技术人员和群众相结合种试验田的办法，解决生产关键问题。9月份，他们生产柴油机的任务是二百台，到25日才完成了一百零二台。车间支部分析了生产关键，认为要完成生产任务，必须立即提高装配小组的生产能力。于是车间领导干部和技术人员组成小组，深入装配小组种试验田，结果使这个月的任务超额完成。
    庆华工具厂还吸收一部分工人组成以原脱产干部为核心的业余职能小组，分别担任车间的各项管理工作，有关的几个职能人员只在月初或月末业务工作紧张时，抽出两三天时间集中处理业务工作。这样便做到了车间干部全部不脱产，直接参加生产领导生产。这个厂在实行车间干部不脱产的作法以后，厂级各科室也相应地进行了合并，把原来十三个科室合并为四个办公室，职能人员都作“多面手”。因此，全厂脱产干部又由占全厂职工的4.8％降到2％。建华、华安两厂在“两参一改”的基础上，还开始试行干部和工人轮换的制度。
