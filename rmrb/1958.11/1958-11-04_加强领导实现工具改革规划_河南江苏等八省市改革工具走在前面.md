    Strengthen Leadership to Realize Tool Reform Plans
    Henan, Jiangsu, and Eight Other Provinces and Cities Lead in Tool Reform
    (Our Newspaper News) As of now, the nation has popularized over 320 million pieces of new and improved farm tools, accounting for 76% of the planned number for promotion this year in various regions; produced over 110 million sets of ball bearings, accounting for 29.5% of the planned production; installed ball bearings on over 41 million pieces of farm equipment; 784 counties and cities nationwide have basically achieved ball-bearing implementation for rotating tools; over 2.4 million rope-traction machines have been promoted, accounting for 30.9% of the planned number. Overall, the achievements in farm tool reform are significant; however, many new farm tools with promotional value have not been promoted and used in a timely and widespread manner, and the progress of the movement in some regions is still very slow.
    The regions with faster promotion progress include Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hunan, Anhui, Guangxi, Shanghai, and Beijing. These regions have promoted a larger number of various farm tools, having completed or nearly completed the planned numbers. Gansu, Hubei, Yunnan, and other regions made rapid progress in the early stages of the farm tool reform movement, but in recent months, there has been stagnation. To complete this year's plan, the greatest effort is still needed. Heilongjiang Province made very slow progress initially but quickly promoted over 200,000 rope-traction machines in the promotion of rope-traction machines.
    The main experience of some regions where the farm tool reform movement has been carried out well is that they have grasped the current urgent situation of labor shortage in agricultural production, made appropriate arrangements for farm tool reform work, and organized professional teams to engage in farm tool reform. For example, Jiangdu, Jiangpu, and other counties in Jiangsu Province organized deep plowing corps, used rope-traction machines for deep plowing, and completed the deep plowing task ahead of schedule.
    After many new farm tools were promoted to the masses, they were continuously improved and enhanced in actual use. The stump-less winding winches reformed in Changxing, Zhejiang, Huang County, Shandong, and Beijing have reduced the heavy labor of driving piles compared to the original winches and improved the efficiency of use.
    The slow progress in promotion in most regions is due to the lack of proper arrangements for farm tool reform work under the extremely tight conditions of steel production and the "Three Autumns" tasks. They mistakenly believed that tools could not be reformed during labor shortages, but in fact, tool reform is to fundamentally solve the labor shortage. Some regions in Jiangxi Province stopped the production of ball bearings, and in Wu Xing County, Zhejiang Province, all but 100 of the 3,000 carpenters were transferred to the steel front, resulting in a lack of technical backbone for the farm tool reform team, which seriously affected the progress of tool reform. At the same time, in some areas, the work was not thorough enough, the masses were not fully mobilized, and they were satisfied with inventions and general on-site meetings and exhibitions, without conducting specific organizational work and in-depth inspections of the actual results of promotion. Therefore, the farm tool reform movement was hindered.
    Currently, various regions are taking measures to strive to overcome the problems existing in the work, continue to vigorously engage in farm tool reform, and strive to complete the plans for various farm tool reforms by the end of the year to achieve semi-mechanization.
    In addition, the National Farm Tool Exhibition selected a total of 682 exhibits that should be awarded from more than 4,000 exhibits. The exhibition decided to reward the units or individuals who invented and created these exhibits. Among them, there were 21 special prizes, 59 excellent prizes, and 602 general prizes. The National Farm Tool Exhibition closed on September 20. After the closing, the work of evaluating and awarding the exhibits continued. (Attached picture)

### 加强领导实现工具改革规划  河南江苏等八省市改革工具走在前面

    加强领导实现工具改革规划
    河南江苏等八省市改革工具走在前面
    本报讯　到目前为止，全国已经推广了各种新农具和改良农具三亿二千多万件，占各地今年推广规划数的76％；生产滚珠轴承一亿一千多万套，占规划生产数29.5％。安装滚珠轴承的农具四千一百多万件，全国有七百八十四个县、市已基本实现了运转工具的滚珠轴承化；绳索牵引机已推广二百四十多万部，占规划数的30.9％。总的来看，农具改革的成绩是很大的；但是目前还有很多有推广价值的新农具没有及时地、普遍地推广、使用起来，有些地区运动的进展还很缓慢。
    推广进度较快的有河南、江苏、山东、湖南、安徽、广西、上海、北京等地，这些地区各项农具的推广数量较多，已经完成或接近完成预订规划数。甘肃、湖北、云南等地在农具改革运动的初期进展较快，但最近几个月来有停滞不前的现象，要完成今年的规划还需作最大的努力；黑龙江省初期进展很慢，而在推广绳索牵引机运动中很快推广了二十万多部。
    有的地区农具改革运动之所以开展得好，主要经验是：抓紧了当前农业生产中劳动力紧张的突击情况，对农具改革工作作了适当安排，组织专业队伍，从事农具改革。如江苏省江都、江浦等县，组织深翻兵团，以绳索牵引机深耕，提前完成深翻任务。
    不少新的农具在推广到群众中去以后，在实际使用中不断得到改进提高。浙江长兴、山东黄县、北京等地改制成的无桩绞关，比原来的绞关减轻了繁重的打桩劳动，提高了使用效率。
    推广进度缓慢的地区，多数是由于在钢铁、“三秋”任务十分紧张的情况下，对农具改革工作缺乏妥善安排。他们误以为劳动力紧张中不能改革工具，其实工具改革正是为了从根本上解决劳动力的紧张。江西省有的地区停止了滚珠轴承的生产，浙江省吴兴县三千木工留下一百人外，都调到钢铁战线，致使农具改革队伍缺乏了技术骨干，这就严重地影响了工具改革的进度。同时有的地区，工作不够深入，没有充分发动群众，满足于创造发明和一般现场会、展览会，而没有进行具体的组织工作和深入检查推广的实际效果。因此，农具改革运动受到阻碍。
    目前各地正在采取措施，努力克服工作中存在的问题，继续大搞农具改革，以期在年底以前完成各项农具改革的规划，实现半机械化。
    又讯　全国农具展览会在四千多件展品中评选出应当受奖的展品共达六百八十二件。展览会决定对这些展品的发明创造单位或个人给予奖励。其中，受特等奖的有二十一个，受优等奖的五十九个，受一般奖的有六百零二个。全国农具展览会是9月20日闭幕的。闭幕之后继续进行了展品评奖工作。（附图片）
