Dear Comrades,

The 41st anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution has arrived. All the people of China are jubilantly celebrating this glorious festival. Here, I would like to first, in the name of the Chinese people, extend the warmest congratulations to our dearest brothers and sisters – the great Soviet people who first raised the red flag of the October Revolution!

The October Revolution is the greatest revolution in world history, and this revolution opened a new era in human history. The October Revolution began the transition of the whole world from capitalism to socialism and communism, and therefore it is the fundamental turning point in human history. The October Revolution gave birth to the great Soviet Union, broke through the chains of imperialist rule and oppression of the people of the world, and encouraged the people of the world to unite and fight against imperialist rule and oppression. Therefore, imperialism and all reactionaries fear the great anniversary of the October Revolution, while the proletariat, the working people, the oppressed nations, and progressive mankind all over the world love the great anniversary of the October Revolution and regard it as their great festival.

The great October Socialist Revolution took place forty-one years ago. As Lenin said: "The further this great day recedes from us, the more obvious the significance of the Russian proletarian revolution becomes." The banner of the October Revolution is invincible. The past forty-one years have been forty-one years in which capitalism and imperialism have moved towards their demise with increasing speed, forty-one years in which socialism has developed upwards with increasing irresistible force, forty-one years in which the world's national revolutionary forces, supported by socialist forces, have become an irresistible trend, and forty-one years in which world peace forces have developed increasingly widely and war forces have become increasingly isolated.

In the past forty-one years, very great changes have taken place in the world. The criminal system of imperialism has caused mankind to experience two world wars in less than half a century. However, the First World War produced the Soviet Union with a population of 200 million, and the Second World War produced the socialist camp with a population of nearly one billion. In the twenty years from the First World War to the Second World War, the Soviet Union fought alone, and the capitalist world was able to maintain temporary stability for a period of time. However, since the Second World War, the situation has been greatly different. A series of countries in Eastern Europe and Asia, including China with a population of 650 million, have also advanced victoriously along the road of the October Revolution after the Soviet Union. Socialism has formed a powerful world system, forming a great socialist camp that occupies more than one-third of the total number of mankind and is geographically integrated. Hundreds of millions of oppressed people in the world have greatly raised their revolutionary consciousness through the tempering of the anti-fascist war. The world rule of imperialism has fallen into a deeper crisis, and the various contradictions within the imperialist system have become more acute. The colonies that they originally relied on for survival and were originally regarded as solid rear areas are now collapsing piece by piece, becoming the front lines against imperialism. Under their feet, there are volcanoes everywhere, with earthquakes at any time. The new world of the rising sun and the old world of the setting sun form a strong contrast.

The great Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are advancing victoriously on the road of communist construction. The total industrial output of the Soviet Union in the first three quarters of this year increased by 10% compared with the same period last year. In terms of several major industrial products, the Soviet Union's coal mining in the first half of this year exceeded the total mining volume in 1949, steel production exceeded the total output in 1950, oil exceeded the total output in 1953, and natural gas exceeded the total output in 1956. The speed of agricultural development in the Soviet Union has also greatly accelerated, and it has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. As for the development of cutting-edge science and technology in the Soviet Union, it has long surpassed the most developed capitalist countries. In the competition of artificial earth satellites, the Soviet Union is the absolute champion, and the United States has not yet had the ability to launch an artificial earth satellite that can be seen with the naked eye at high altitude into the sky. The success of the Soviet artificial earth satellite is by no means accidental. It is the result of the high degree of development of industry and science and technology in all aspects of the Soviet Union, and it is a concentrated manifestation of the superiority of socialism. Our people are particularly pleased to know that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, scheduled to be held in January next year, will adopt the control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy in the next seven years, which will be a grand program of communist construction. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union will realize its basic economic task ahead of schedule, catching up with and surpassing the United States in terms of per capita product output. The great Soviet people, in advancing along the road of communism, always attract and encourage the people of the world with the infinitely beautiful prospects of communism. The great Soviet people always stand at the forefront of the people of the world, constantly making significant contributions to strengthening the power of the socialist camp and to the cause of maintaining world peace and opposing imperialist aggressive wars. The people of the world all cheer for the victories and achievements of the great Soviet people!

The Chinese revolution is a continuation of the October Revolution. The Chinese people, advancing along the victorious road of the October Revolution, are now working hard with soaring enthusiasm to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way on the basis of the victories they have already achieved. The great leap forward in production of doubling grain and doubling steel, the people's commune movement spreading throughout the country, and the movement of the entire people becoming soldiers, illustrate the unprecedented enthusiasm of the Chinese people in building socialism and striving for communism. Our Party fully estimates and firmly believes in the great strength of the revolutionary masses and has fully brought into play the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Chinese people. The face of our motherland is undergoing rapid changes.

Other socialist countries are also moving forward on the common road of the October Revolution. Our entire socialist family is showing a thriving scene everywhere. Due to the unprecedented high economic growth of the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries, the proportion of industrial output of the socialist camp in the total industrial output of the world has increased from about 33% last year to about 40% this year. The day when the socialist camp catches up with and overwhelms the capitalist world not only in terms of production development speed, but also in terms of total production volume, is not far away.

The October Revolution built a bridge linking the socialist revolution and the national revolution. After the October Revolution, the anti-imperialist national revolutionary movement, supported by socialist forces, has greatly developed. In the past year, the development of the national revolutionary movement has reached a new upsurge. The flames of anti-colonialism are not only burning in the Arab East, but have also spread to the African continent and Latin America, rapidly disintegrating the foundations of imperialist rule. The outstanding victory of the Iraqi national revolution and the great victory of the Arab people's struggle against the armed intervention of the US and British imperialism in the Middle East are a huge driving force for the entire national revolutionary movement. The socialist camp and the national revolutionary movement have common interests in opposing imperialist aggression. The union of these two forces is giving imperialism increasingly heavy blows. With the support of socialist countries, anti-colonialism has become an irresistible historical trend. Imperialism has irretrievably reached its end.

On the imperialist camp side, just as the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the Socialist countries pointed out: "The capitalist economy cannot avoid new and profound shocks and crises," the capitalist world has fallen into the abyss of economic crisis. The head of imperialism, the United States, has been hit the hardest. At the same time, the economic crisis in the United States is impacting the entire capitalist world. The various contradictions within the imperialist system have become increasingly acute. The youthful vitality of the socialist system and the old decay of the imperialist system have never been as obvious as they are now. Under such circumstances, the day when the socialist camp completely defeats imperialism through peaceful competition will come sooner.

The socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union adhere to a policy of peace. Their unremitting efforts on pressing international issues such as reducing armaments, prohibiting the manufacture, use and testing of weapons of mass destruction, easing international tensions, establishing collective security in Europe and Asia, and peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems have been warmly welcomed and supported by all peace-loving countries and people in the world. However, the imperialist aggressive groups headed by the United States completely violate the wishes of the people of the world, stubbornly pursue their "position of strength" policy, actively expand armaments and prepare for war, create tensions everywhere, and carry out aggression and expansion everywhere. This cannot but make people more clearly realize that the "communist threat" fabricated by the imperialists is completely a smokescreen to cover up their aggressive actions. The imperialist aggressive groups headed by the United States are now using their own actions to expose their true colors more and more clearly. All the hypocritical masks of the United States have been torn off, which cannot but put itself in a position of political isolation and being besieged by angry people. More and more people have realized that imperialism is the root of war and colonialism, the goal of the peace movement has become clearer and clearer, and the peace movement and the anti-colonial movement have been combined.

The imperialist aggressive groups headed by the United States have done all kinds of bad things. However, in today's world where socialism, national revolution and the peace movement are so powerful, the era of imperialist hegemony is long gone. Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. As long as we unite with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, as long as all forces that love peace and oppose aggression unite, abandon illusions about imperialism, and fight resolutely, any aggressive conspiracy of imperialism can certainly be crushed. Now the forces defending peace have become so strong that, although the imperialist war maniacs want to launch a war, as the communique of the meeting between Comrades Mao Zedong and Khrushchev said, "If the imperialist war maniacs dare to impose a war on the people of the world, then all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and people will certainly unite closely, completely eliminate the imperialist aggressors, and lay the foundation for the permanent peace of the world." This cannot but force the imperialist aggressors to have some concerns. Many facts in the past year have clearly confirmed this point. The aggression and subversion activities carried out by the US and British imperialism against Indonesia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have all suffered miserable defeats. The shameful crimes of the United States interfering in our internal affairs and carrying out war provocations in the Taiwan Strait area have also suffered miserable defeats. The diplomatic policy of US imperialism has not only aroused the opposition of the people of the world, but also aroused the strong opposition of its allies and its own people. The serious defeat of the ruling Republican Party in the elections is precisely an indication of the extreme dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the American people with the domestic and foreign policies of the US government. Recently, the United States, under pressure from the situation, changed its approach, and vainly attempted to achieve its goal of permanently occupying our territory Taiwan and invading our country by creating "two Chinas." However, this plan of US imperialism is also bound to fail completely. The Chinese people, including the patriotic military and civilians in Taiwan, will never allow the US conspiracy to succeed. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen and Mazu, and the US aggressors must get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait!

New forces are bound to defeat corrupt forces. Since the victory of the October Revolution, the victory of the people of the world has become a foregone conclusion. Forty-one years later, today, this foregone conclusion of victory is even clearer, and the lifespan of imperialism will not be long. The great revolutionary teacher Lenin's ideas about the advanced East and the backward West have now been fully confirmed. The East and the West we are talking about are not general geographical concepts, but political concepts. The East refers to the socialist camp and the national revolutionary forces in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and the West refers to the imperialist countries. Today's East is full of light, and today's West is smoggy. The days in the Eastern world are good, and the days in the Western world are not good. The Eastern world, which was ridiculed as backward and dark for one or two hundred years, has now become advanced due to the rise of the socialist revolution and the rise of the national revolutionary movement; the West, which was once in an advanced position during the rise of capitalism, is now corrupt and backward. The old world of the West must be replaced by the new world of the East. Any struggle of imperialism and all reactionaries is useless.

The great victory of the October Revolution and the great victory of the world revolutionary cause in the forty-one years after the October Revolution are the great victories of Marxism-Leninism. A year ago, the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries held in Moscow summarized the basic experience of the international communist movement since the October Revolution, continued to develop Marxism-Leninism, and enriched the treasure house of socialist-communist theory. The declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries very correctly expressed the common road of the October Revolution, and summarized the common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction. This declaration has been accepted by all Marxist-Leninist parties in the world and has become an epoch-making programmatic document of the international communist movement. The facts of the past year have proved that this great revolutionary declaration is a beacon guiding us towards the great victory of socialism-communism. The common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction pointed out in this great document, that is, the common road of the October Revolution that we usually talk about, are precisely the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, which is applicable to all countries in the world that are now moving towards socialism. If the road of the October Revolution is violated, the victory of socialism and communism cannot be achieved.

We are very pleased to see that the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the international communist movement centered on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have become more consolidated and strengthened. This unity is the great source of our strength and the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the international working class's common cause. The Yugoslav revisionist group has abandoned the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism and attempted to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement. However, the Yugoslav revisionist group has suffered a shameful defeat. Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries unanimously condemned and opposed modern revisionism in the workers' movement in Yugoslavia and other countries. The dying imperialists always want to break through our fortress from within, and they cheer for the divisive activities of modern revisionists. However, the departure of those revisionist elements from the revolutionary ranks does not cause any loss to us, but instead makes our ranks purer and stronger.

The Communist Party of China has always educated the Chinese people with the spirit of combining internationalism and patriotism, and takes consolidating the international unity of the proletariat as its international responsibility. The Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly emphasized that strengthening the fraternal friendship between the two great countries of China and the Soviet Union is an important symbol of proletarian internationalism. The alliance between the two great socialist countries of China and the Soviet Union is not only an important condition for us to achieve the great victory of socialism-communism, but also a powerful guarantee for peace in the Far East and the world. The unity between China and the Soviet Union has been further strengthened due to the talks between Comrades Mao Zedong and Khrushchev in August this year. Our socialist cause has always received fraternal assistance from the Soviet Union in many aspects. In the recent just struggle of our people against US aggression, we have also received the strongest support from the Soviet Union. Comrade Khrushchev warned the US aggressors with the most powerful words: "To infringe on China is to infringe on the Soviet Union," which is the concentrated expression of the fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Here, I would like to once again, in the name of the Chinese people, express my heartfelt thanks to the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their great internationalist assistance and support to our country!

More than a decade ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said that communism is surging around the world with an overwhelming force, with the power of thunder, and with magnificent beauty. These words have been proved by countless historical facts, and they will continue to be proved by history. The victory of the October Revolution will always inspire us. The banner of the October Revolution will inevitably guide us to greater victories.

Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!
Long live the great Soviet Union!
Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live the eternal and unbreakable unity between China and the Soviet Union!
Long live Marxism-Leninism!
Long live socialism-communism!

    新世界旭日东升　旧世界夕阳残照
    林伯渠同志在首都庆祝十月革命四十一周年大会上的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年来到了。全中国人民都在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝这个光辉的节日。在这里，我要首先以中国人民的名义，向我们最亲爱的兄弟姊妹——首先举起十月革命红旗的伟大的苏联人民，致以最热烈的祝贺！
    十月革命是世界历史上最伟大的革命，这个革命开辟了人类历史的新时期。十月革命开始了全世界从资本主义向社会主义和共产主义的过渡，因而它是人类历史的根本转折点。十月革命产生了伟大的苏联，突破了帝国主义统治和压迫全世界人民的锁链，鼓舞了全世界人民团结起来进行反对帝国主义统治和压迫的斗争。因此，帝国主义和一切反动派都害怕伟大的十月革命纪念节，而全世界的无产阶级、劳动人民、被压迫民族和进步人类，都热爱伟大的十月革命纪念节，把它作为自己的伟大节日。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命过去四十一年了。正如列宁所说：“这个伟大日子离开我们愈远，俄国无产阶级革命的意义就愈加明显”。十月革命的旗帜，是不可战胜的。过去的四十一年是资本主义和帝国主义越来越迅速地走向末日的四十一年，是社会主义越来越锐不可挡地向上发展的四十一年，是世界民族革命力量在社会主义力量支持下成为不可抗拒的潮流的四十一年，是世界和平力量日益广泛发展和战争势力日益趋向孤立的四十一年。
    过去的四十一年，世界上发生了非常巨大的变化。帝国主义的罪恶制度，使人类在不到半个世纪中，经历了两次世界大战。但是，第一次世界大战产生了一个两亿人口的苏联，第二次世界大战产生了一个近十亿人口的社会主义阵营。从第一次世界大战到第二次世界大战的二十年间，苏联还是孤军奋斗，资本主义世界还能在一段时间内维持暂时的稳定。但是，第二次世界大战以来，形势是大大不同了。东欧和亚洲一系列国家，其中包括六亿五千万人口的中国，继苏联之后，也沿着十月革命的道路胜利前进了。社会主义形成了强大的世界体系，组成了占人类总数三分之一以上的、地理上联成整体的伟大的社会主义阵营。世界上几万万被压迫的人民，经过了反法西斯战争的锻炼，革命的觉悟大大提高了。帝国主义的世界统治，已经陷入更加深刻的危机之中，帝国主义体系内部的各种矛盾，已经更加尖锐化。他们原来所赖以生存的、原来被当作巩固后方的殖民地，现在，正一大片、一大片地崩陷下去，变成为反对帝国主义的前线。在他们的脚下，到处是火山，随时有地震。旭日初升的新世界，和夕阳残照的旧世界，形成了强烈的对比。
    伟大的苏联人民，在伟大的苏联共产党的领导下，正在共产主义建设的道路上胜利前进。苏联的工业总产量今年头三个季度比去年同期增长了10％。以几种主要的工业产品来说，今年上半年苏联开采的煤超过了1949年的全年开采量，钢产量超过了1950年全年产量，石油超过1953年全年产量，天然瓦斯超过1956年全年产量。苏联农业发展的速度也大大加快了，并且在今年获得了空前未有的大丰收。至于苏联尖端科学技术的发展，早已超过最发达的资本主义国家。在人造地球卫星的竞赛中，苏联是绝对冠军，美国至今还没有本领把一个在高空中肉眼能看得见的人造地球卫星发射到天上去。苏联人造地球卫星的成功决不是偶然的，这是苏联各个方面的工业和科学技术高度发展的结果，是社会主义优越性的集中的表现。我国人民特别高兴地知道，定于明年1月举行的苏共第二十一次代表大会，将要通过今后七年苏联国民经济发展的控制数字，这将是一个宏伟的共产主义建设纲领。毫无疑问，苏联将要提前实现它的基本经济任务，在按人口平均的产品产量上赶上和超过美国。伟大的苏联人民在沿着共产主义道路的前进中，总是以无限美好的共产主义前景，吸引和鼓舞着全世界人民。伟大的苏联人民，总是站在世界人民的最前列，不断地对于加强社会主义阵营的威力，对于维护世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略战争的事业作出重大的贡献。全世界人民都为伟大苏联人民的胜利和成就而欢呼！
    中国革命是十月革命的继续。沿着十月革命胜利道路前进的中国人民，现在正在已经取得的胜利的基础上，以冲天的干劲，为多快好省地建设社会主义而努力奋斗。粮食翻一番和钢铁翻一番的生产大跃进，普及全国的人民公社运动和全民皆兵运动，说明了中国人民建设社会主义和为共产主义而奋斗的空前的积极性。我们党充分估计和坚决相信革命的人民群众的伟大力量，充分地发挥了中国人民的革命积极性。我们祖国的面貌，正在起着日新月异的变化。
    其他的社会主义国家，也正在十月革命的共同道路上向前迈进。我们整个社会主义大家庭，到处呈现着欣欣向荣的景色。由于苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家的经济的空前高涨，社会主义阵营的工业产量在全世界工业总产量中所占的比重，已经由去年的33％左右提高到今年的40％左右。社会主义阵营不但在生产发展速度上，而且在生产总量上，赶上和压倒资本主义世界的日子，已经不远了。
    十月革命架起了一座桥梁，把社会主义革命和民族革命联结起来。十月革命以后，被社会主义力量所支持的反帝民族革命运动，有了极大的发展。最近一年来，民族革命运动的发展又有了新的高涨。反殖民主义的火焰不但燃烧在阿拉伯东方，而且已经蔓延到非洲大陆和拉丁美洲，正在迅速地瓦解着帝国主义统治的基础。伊拉克民族革命的出色的胜利，以及阿拉伯人民反对美、英帝国主义武装干涉中东的斗争的伟大胜利，对于整个民族革命运动是个巨大的推动力量。社会主义阵营和民族革命运动在反对帝国主义侵略上有着共同的利益，这两种力量的联合，正在给予帝国主义愈来愈沉重的打击。在社会主义国家的支援下，反殖民主义已经成为不可抗拒的历史潮流。帝国主义已经无可挽回地临到末日了。
    在帝国主义阵营方面，恰如社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言所指出的：“资本主义经济不能避免新的、深刻的震动和危机”，资本主义世界已经陷入了经济危机的深渊。帝国主义的头子美国受到的打击最为严重，同时，美国的经济危机又正在冲击着整个资本主义世界。帝国主义体系内部的各种矛盾已经日益尖锐化。社会主义制度的青春活力同帝国主义制度的老朽腐败，从来没有像现在这样的明显。在这种情况下，社会主义阵营通过和平竞赛彻底战胜帝国主义的日子，将会更快到来。
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国坚持和平政策，它们在裁减军备、禁止制造、使用和试验大规模毁灭性武器，缓和国际紧张局势，建立欧洲和亚洲的集体安全，不同社会制度国家和平共处等迫切的国际问题上所作的坚持不懈的努力，得到了全世界所有爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈欢迎和支持。但是，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团完全违背世界人民的愿望，顽固地推行其“实力地位”政策，积极扩军备战，到处制造紧张局势，到处进行侵略和扩张。这就不能不使人们更加清楚地认识到，帝国主义者所捏造的“共产主义威胁”完全是用以掩护它们侵略行动的烟幕弹。以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团，现在正在用它们自己的行动，愈来愈清楚地揭露它们自己的真面目。美国的一切伪善面具都撕毁了，这就不能不使它自己陷于政治上的孤立和被愤怒的人民围攻的地位。愈来愈多的人，已经认识到：帝国主义是战争和殖民主义的根源，和平运动的目标已经越来越明确，而且和平运动和反殖民主义运动已经结合起来了。
    以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团做尽坏事。但是在社会主义、民族革命和和平运动如此强大的今天，帝国主义横行霸道的时代早已一去不复返了。帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。只要同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结起来，只要所有爱好和平反对侵略的力量团结起来，丢掉对帝国主义的幻想，坚决斗争，帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋都是一定可以粉碎的。现在保卫和平的力量已经强大到这样地步，帝国主义战争狂人虽然想发动战争，但是，正如毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫两位同志会谈公报所说，“如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上，那末，所有爱好和平和爱好自由的国家和人民必将紧密地团结在一起，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的永久和平。”这就不能不迫使帝国主义侵略者有所顾虑。最近一年来的许多事实，特别明显地证实了这一点。美、英帝国主义对于印度尼西亚、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、约旦以及其他亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家所进行的侵略和颠覆活动，都遭到了惨败。美国在台湾海峡地区干涉我国内政和进行战争挑衅的可耻罪行，也遭到了惨败。美国帝国主义的外交政策不但引起了全世界人民的反对，而且引起了它的盟国和本国人民的强烈反对，美国执政党共和党在选举中的严重失败，正是说明了美国广大人民对美国政府内政外交的极端不满。最近美国迫于形势，改变做法，妄图通过制造“两个中国”来达到它永远霸占我国领土台湾和侵略我国的目的。但是，美帝国主义的这种打算也是一定要彻底失败的。中国人民，包括台湾爱国的军民同胞，决不容许美国的阴谋得逞。中国人民一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门和马祖，美国侵略者必须从台湾和台湾海峡滚出去！
    新生力量一定战胜腐朽力量。从十月革命的胜利起，世界人民的胜利已经成为定局了。四十一年后的今天，这个胜利的定局是更加清楚了，帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。伟大的革命导师列宁关于先进的东方和落后的西方的思想，现在完全证实了。我们所说的东方和西方，不是一般的地理的概念，而是政治概念。东方指的是社会主义阵营以及亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族革命力量，西方指的是帝国主义国家。今天的东方正是一片光明，今天的西方是乌烟瘴气。东方世界的日子很好过，西方世界的日子很不好过。在一二百年间被人讥笑为落后的、黑暗的东方世界，现在已经由于社会主义革命的兴起，由于民族革命运动的兴起，而成为先进的了；在资本主义上升时期曾经一度居于先进地位的西方，现在是腐败了，落后了。西方的旧世界一定要被东方的新世界所代替。帝国主义和一切反动派的任何挣扎都是没有用的。
    十月革命的伟大胜利和十月革命后四十一年来世界革命事业的伟大胜利，就是马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利。一年以前，在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议，总结了十月革命以来国际共产主义运动的基本经验，继续向前发展了马克思列宁主义，丰富了社会主义—共产主义理论的宝库。社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言非常正确地表达了十月革命的共同道路，总结出社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律。这个宣言已经为全世界所有的马克思列宁主义的政党所接受，成为国际共产主义运动的划时代的纲领性的文件。一年来的事实证明，这个伟大的革命宣言，是指引我们走向社会主义—共产主义伟大胜利的灯塔。这个伟大的文件中所指出的关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律，也就是我们平常所说的十月革命的共同道路，正是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，它是适用于现在世界上一切走向社会主义的国家的。如果违反了十月革命道路，就不能够取得社会主义和共产主义的胜利。
    我们非常高兴地看到，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和以苏联共产党为中心的国际共产主义运动的团结更为巩固了。这个团结是我们力量的伟大泉源，是国际工人阶级共同事业的胜利的根本保证。南斯拉夫修正主义集团背弃了马克思列宁主义的根本原则，企图破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结。但是，南斯拉夫修正主义集团已经遭到了可耻的失败。各国共产党和工人党一致谴责与反对南斯拉夫和其他国家的工人运动中的现代修正主义。垂死挣扎的帝国主义者，总是想从内部来攻破我们的堡垒，他们为现代修正主义者的分裂活动而喝采。但是，那些修正主义分子离开革命队伍，对我们并没有什么损失，反而使我们的队伍更加纯洁，更加坚强。
    中国共产党历来以国际主义和爱国主义相结合的精神教育中国人民，以巩固无产阶级的国际团结作为自己的国际责任。中国共产党和毛泽东同志一再强调，加强中苏两个伟大国家的兄弟友谊，就是无产阶级国际主义的重要标志。中苏两个伟大的社会主义国家的同盟，不但是我们取得社会主义—共产主义伟大胜利的重要条件，而且是远东和世界和平的强大保障。中苏两国的团结，由于今年8月毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫两位同志的会谈，而进一步地加强了。我国的社会主义事业，向来得到苏联的多方面的兄弟的援助。在最近我国人民反对美国侵略的正义斗争中，又得到了苏联的最强有力的支持。赫鲁晓夫同志以最有力量的词句，对美国侵略者提出了警告：“侵犯中国就是侵犯苏联”，就是中苏两国兄弟情谊的集中表现。在这里，我要再一次以中国人民的名义，衷心感谢苏联政府和苏联人民对我国的伟大的国际主义的援助和支持！
    十几年前，毛泽东同志就讲过，共产主义正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春。这些话，已经被无数的历史事实所证明，它还将继续被历史所证实。十月革命的胜利，永远鼓舞着我们。十月革命的旗帜，必然要引导我们走向更大的胜利。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    伟大的苏联万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    中苏两国永恒的牢不可破的团结万岁！
    马克思列宁主义万岁！
    社会主义—共产主义万岁！
