    Making "Winter Clothes" for Oxen
    (Our report) The Weixing (Satellite) Commune's 14th Brigade in Qi County, Henan Province, spent three days making winter coats for 141 head of draught animals. These coats are woven from thin hemp rope and rice straw, with one side being hairy and the other smooth. They can be used for both warmth and rain protection, with each costing only 38 fen. When in use, they are placed on the animals and tied with thin ropes at the neck, legs, and belly. The whole commune is now promoting this method. (Gang Feng)

    为耕牛做“冬衣”
    本报讯　河南杞县卫星公社十四大队用三天时间给一百四十一头耕畜做好了过冬的大衣。这种大衣是用细麻绳和稻草编织的，一面毛一面光，可作取暖防雨两用，每件成本只合三角八分钱。用时盖在牲畜身上，在脖子、腿、肚等处用细绳扎住就行了。现在全公社都在推广这个办法。　（钢锋）
