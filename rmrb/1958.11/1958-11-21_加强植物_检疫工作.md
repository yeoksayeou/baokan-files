    Strengthen Plant Quarantine Work
    In the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, the inter-provincial transfer of superior seeds is increasing day by day. However, many comrades often neglect plant quarantine work when transferring seeds. Judging from the seeds, seedlings, and plant products transported into Qinghai this year, most of them have not been quarantined and inspected, and some even carry quarantine objects. For example, the peanut seeds transported from Weinan, Shaanxi Province, in April did not have a quarantine certificate. After our inspection, it was found to carry peanut nematodes. Another example is the sunflower seeds transferred from Heilongjiang and the wheat seeds transported from Hubei, Shaanxi and other places, which have not been quarantined and inspected. It is hoped that all regions will work together to do a good job in plant quarantine.

    加强植物  检疫工作
    在农业生产大跃进的形势下，省与省之间互调优良种子的情况日益增多，但在调运种子时很多同志往往把植物检疫工作忽视了。根据今年运入青海的种子、苗木及植物产品来看，大部分未经检疫检验，有的并带有检疫对象。如4月份由陕西渭南运入我省的花生种子，就没有检疫证书，经我们检验后发现带有花生线虫病。又如从黑龙江调来的向日葵种子；湖北、陕西等地运来的小麦种子等，都没有检疫检验过。希望各地共同做好植物检疫工作。
