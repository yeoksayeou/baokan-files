    The Fundamental Task of Political Work: Propagating Communist Ideology
    The Struggle Between Two Ideologies Intensifies
    The fifth issue of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee's theoretical journal "Ideological Front" published a commentary entitled "Vigorously Launch a Communist Ideological Education Movement." The commentary begins by stating: The propagation of communist ideology should be regarded as the fundamental task of ideological work. The commentary goes on to say: In the past, the propagation of communism was mainly as an ideological system, a theoretical system, as a social vision, and as the ultimate goal of revolutionary struggle. Now, the propagation of communism has direct practical significance.
    The commentary says: At present, the establishment of factories by schools, schools by factories, the implementation of a supply system plus wage system in people's communes, the abolition of piece-rate wages for workers, the demand by writers to reduce royalties, especially the widespread establishment of people's communes, etc., all demonstrate that there are already communist factors in our real life, and the realization of communism in our country is not far off. However, it should also be noted that due to the emergence and development of communist sprouts, many new contradictions have arisen between the economic base and the superstructure of our society; the struggle between communist ideology and capitalist ideology has intensified.
    The commentary points out: The fundamental method of carrying out communist ideological education is to launch ideological struggle in conjunction with many problems existing in current real life. Such as the issue of people's communes eliminating the remnants of private ownership of the means of production and implementing the supply system, the issue of combining school education with productive labor, the issue of workers abolishing piece-rate wages and cadres changing to the supply system, and so on. In the process of solving these problems, there will inevitably be a struggle between the communist idea of equality and the bourgeois right ideology, there will be a struggle between collectivism and individualism and departmentalism, there will be a struggle between the Marxist-Leninist dialectical viewpoint and the metaphysical viewpoint, in a word, there will inevitably be a struggle between two roads, two lines, and two styles of work. To carry out the communist ideological education movement is to guide the masses to conduct a great airing of views, a great contending, and a great debate around these practical issues, it is to educate the masses to greatly destroy capitalist ideology and greatly establish communist ideology.
    From Each According to His Ability is the Premise of To Each According to His Needs
    The ninth issue of "Liberation" published an article by Zhou Linzhi entitled "Commenting on Some Erroneous Views on Labor and Distribution Issues in Shanghai Publications." The article says: One of the fundamental characteristics of communist society is that everyone works for society without compensation, and this uncompensated, unremunerated labor depends on the people's high level of communist consciousness. However, in some of our publications promoting communism, this point is often overlooked. They only talk about the improvement of productivity, culture, science, and technology, without talking about putting politics in command; they only talk about the improvement of living standards, without talking about communist labor. In a word, they only grasp "to each according to his needs," one half of the complete formula "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," and discard "from each according to his ability," the other half. They fail to emphasize that from each according to his ability is the premise of to each according to his needs.
    The author says: We neither deny that in communist society, people's living standards will be greatly improved; nor do we deny that in communist society, people's working hours will be shortened and labor intensity will be greatly reduced. These are all non-problematic. The problem is that communism needs to be built with arduous labor.
    Finally, the author analyzes the reason why these publications produce this kind of erroneous view, saying: The basic reason is that they do not use communist ideology, dialectical materialism, and historical materialism to view and analyze the issues of distribution and labor in socialism and communism, but use petty-bourgeois or even bourgeois ideology, idealism, and metaphysics to view and analyze the issues of distribution and labor in socialism and communism.
      The Key Lies in Destroying Bourgeois Right Ideology
      The fifth issue of "East Wind" published an article by Yang Wangfu: "On Eliminating the Remnants of Bourgeois Right." The author says: In order to eliminate the remnants of bourgeois right, we must first eliminate bourgeois right ideology and extensively carry out communist ideological education.
    Bourgeois right ideology is, in fact, a manifestation of bourgeois ideology.
    This ideology can be said to have the following key points: First, its essence is still the old bourgeois principle: private property is sacred and inviolable. However, there is no longer private ownership of the means of production now, what exists now is individual talent, individual endowment, and individual labor ability. These things are all one's own private property, and cannot be contributed without compensation. Second, it still regards the relationship between people as a naked relationship of interests, as a relationship of "cash transaction" and "equivalent exchange." How much labor is contributed, how much remuneration is obtained, or even how much remuneration is obtained, how much labor is contributed, the so-called "pay according to work." Otherwise, it is "suffering a loss," it is "cutting the fat off the fat man to put it on the thin man." Third, it mythologizes money. It does not believe in the ideological consciousness of the masses, and does not believe in the role of communist ideology. It seems that only money and the stimulation of material interests can promote the progress of society.
    The author points out: This kind of ideology is fundamentally incompatible with communist ideology. The author says: People are social beings, everything of the individual is inseparable from society, selfishness is only a product of the system of private property, and with the elimination of the system of private property, the concept of selfishness will gradually disappear. The relationship between people should not be a monetary relationship, but a comrade-like relationship of cooperation and mutual assistance. The whole society is a collective. Everyone works for society according to their ability, and naturally everyone can also receive remuneration from society according to their needs. But bourgeois ideology hinders this, so if we do not eliminate bourgeois right ideology, it will hinder our transition to communism.

### 政治工作的根本任务——宣传共产主义思想

    政治工作的根本任务——宣传共产主义思想
    两种思想的斗争更加深化
    陕西省委的理论刊物“思想战线”第五期发表了题为“大力开展共产主义思想教育运动”的评论。评论开始就提出：应该把宣传共产主义思想作为思想工作的根本任务。评论接着说：过去宣传共产主义，主要是作为一种思想体系、理论体系、作为一种社会远景和革命的最终奋斗目标去宣传的。现在，宣传共产主义，就具有直接的实践意义了。
    评论说：目前，像学校办工厂、工厂办学校、人民公社实行供给制加工资制，工人取消计件工资制，作家要求降低稿费，特别是人民公社的普遍建立等等，都说明在我们现实生活中，已经有了共产主义因素，共产主义在我国的实现，已经为期不远了。但是，也应该看到，由于共产主义萌芽的出现和发展，我国社会经济基础和上层建筑之间已经产生了许多新的矛盾；共产主义思想和资本主义思想的斗争更加深化了。
    评论指出：开展共产主义思想教育的根本方法，就是结合目前现实生活存在的很多问题展开思想斗争。像人民公社消灭生产资料私有制残余和实行供给制的问题，学校教育与生产劳动结合的问题，工人取消计件工资和干部改行供给制的问题等等。在解决这些问题的过程中，必然会有共产主义的平等思想同资产阶级法权思想的斗争，会有集体主义同个人主义和本位主义的斗争，会有马克思列宁主义的辩证观点同形而上学观点的斗争，一句话，必然会有两条道路、两条路线、两种作风的斗争，开展共产主义思想教育运动，就是要引导群众围绕这些实际问题，大鸣大放大争大辩，就是要教育群众大破资本主义思想，大立共产主义思想。
    各尽所能是各取所需的前提
    “解放”第九期发表了作者周林知写的“评上海出版物中有关劳动和分配问题的一些错误观点”的文章，文章说：共产主义社会的根本特征之一，就是人人无代价地为社会劳动，而这种无代价的、不计报酬的劳动有赖于人民群众的高度的共产主义觉悟，可是在我们某些宣传共产主义的读物里，常常忽视了这一点，只是大讲生产力、文化科学技术水平的提高，而不讲政治挂帅；只是大讲生活水平的提高，而不讲共产主义的劳动。一句话，“各尽所能，各取所需”这个完整的公式，他们只抓住了“各取所需”这一半，而把“各尽所能”那一半丢掉了。没有强调各尽所能乃是各取所需的前提。
    作者说：我们既不否认在共产主义社会中，人们的生活水平将大大地提高；也不否认在共产主义社会中，人们的劳动时间将会缩短，劳动强度将大大减轻这些都是不成问题的。问题在于，共产主义是要人们用艰苦的劳动去建设的。
    最后作者分析这些出版物所以会产生这种错误观点说：基本原因是没有用共产主义思想、辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义思想来看待和分析社会主义与共产主义的分配和劳动问题，而是用小资产阶级甚至资产阶级思想、唯心主义和形而上学的思想来看待和分析社会主义和共产主义的分配和劳动问题。
      关键在于破资产阶级法权思想
      “东风”第五期发表了杨往夫的一篇文章：“关于破除资产阶级法权残余”。作者说：为了破除资产阶级的法权残余，首先就必须破除资产阶级法权思想，广泛地进行共产主义思想教育。
    资产阶级法权思想，也就是资产阶级思想的表现。
    这种思想，可以说有这么几个要点：第一，它本质上还是资产阶级的那个老原则：私有财产神圣不可侵犯。不过现在没有生产资料的私有了，现在所有的，是个人才智，个人天赋，个人的劳动能力。这些东西都是自己的私产，没有代价是不能贡献出来的。第二，它依然把人和人的关系看做是赤裸裸的利害关系，看做是“现钱交易”“等价交换”的关系。出多少劳动，就取得多少报酬，甚至得多少报酬，就出多少劳动，所谓“按酬付劳”。不然，就是“吃亏”，就是“割胖子的肉安到瘦子身上”了。第三，它把金钱神化了。不相信群众的思想觉悟，不相信共产主义思想的作用。好像只有金钱，只有物质利益的刺激，才能推动社会的前进。
    作者指出：这种思想是和共产主义思想根本不相容的。作者说：人是社会的人，个人的一切都是和社会分不开的，自私自利只是私有财产制度下的产物，随着私有财产制度的消灭，自私自利的观念也将逐渐消灭。人和人之间的关系不应该是金钱关系，而应该是同志式的合作互助关系，整个社会是一个集体。每个人都按自己的能力为社会工作，自然每个人也可以按自己的需要来从社会得到报酬。而资产阶级思想却阻碍着这样作，因此不破除资产阶级法权思想，就阻碍我们向共产主义过渡。
