Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 18th: Japanese labor unions have decided to participate in the national joint struggle against the Kishida Nobusuke government's "Amendment to the Police Officer Duty Execution Law" scheduled for November 26th through strikes, rallies, and other means.

The Japan Coal Miners' Union decided at a tactical committee meeting held in Tokyo on the 17th that Japanese coal miners would simultaneously hold a 24-hour strike on November 26th. The Japan Coal Miners' Union has already notified its affiliated unions of this decision.

The Japan Federation of Steel Industry Workers' Unions, at an enlarged central struggle committee meeting held on the 17th, decided to order unions that have already obtained the right to strike to hold a four-hour strike starting at noon on November 26th. Unions that cannot hold strikes will hold workplace meetings during working hours.

According to a broadcast by Japan Broadcasting Corporation on the 17th, the National Railway Workers' Union decided at a national representative meeting held in Tokyo to hold a large-scale struggle against the revision of the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law" on November 26th.

On the day of the joint struggle, the National Railway Workers' Union will designate eighty-three workplaces related to operations in Tokyo and twenty-six other locations, holding three-hour workplace meetings during working hours; other business departments will also hold thirty-minute workplace meetings.

The meeting also decided that if the police interfere, all personnel outside the designated workplaces mentioned above will also hold meetings.

The National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union also decided that when the national joint struggle is held on November 26th, focusing on train crew members, each of the twenty-seven union branches nationwide will designate one workplace to hold a two-hour workplace meeting during working hours; other workplaces will also conduct struggles to refuse overtime work.

The All Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union decided at a meeting held today to conduct a struggle on an even larger scale than the joint struggle on November 5th. On November 26th, its 150,000 members will simultaneously hold three-hour workplace meetings.

The All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union also decided today that its eight hundred affiliated unions should hold one-hour workplace meetings from the start of working hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 18th: The Japan Teachers' Union, in a statement issued in Tokyo on the 17th, pointed out that the Wakayama Prefecture Board of Education's illegal punishment of the Wakayama Prefecture Teachers' Union is a suppression of the activities of the Teachers' Union in defending peace and democratic education, and is connected to the war policy of the Kishida Nobusuke reactionary government.

The Wakayama Prefecture Board of Education, appointed by the Kishida Nobusuke government, announced illegal punishments on the 17th against leading cadres of the Wakayama Prefecture Teachers' Union because they conducted a struggle against the Kishida Nobusuke government's "performance rating" system.

The statement said that the Teachers' Union, in the name of the entire organization, lodges a serious protest against this illegal punishment and demands its immediate withdrawal. At the same time, the Teachers' Union expressed its intention to further intensify joint action and resolutely fight to the end to crush the "performance rating" system and the "Amendment to the Police Officer Duty Execution Law."

On the same day, Koyanagi Isamu, the director of the Social Democratic Party's Illegal Punishment Countermeasures Committee Secretariat, visited Inoue, the manager of the western branch of the National Railway, to warn him not to illegally punish railway workers who participated in the joint struggle against the "Amendment to the Police Officer Duty Execution Law" on November 5th.

Koyanagi said after the visit: If workers are subjected to illegal punishment, a fierce struggle will be conducted.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 18th: All members of the Wakayama Prefecture Teachers' Union and the Wakayama Prefecture High School Teachers' Union simultaneously held protest rallies throughout the prefecture starting at 3:00 p.m. today, protesting the Kishida Nobusuke government and the Wakayama Prefecture Board of Education's illegal punishment of union cadres and teachers who participated in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law" and demanding the revocation of this illegal punishment.

Prior to this, teachers from 530 primary and secondary schools in Wakayama Prefecture also simultaneously held protest rallies starting at noon, deciding to return all punishment orders.

The Wakayama Prefecture High School Teachers' Union, in order to protest the Wakayama Prefecture Board of Education's illegal punishment of five leading union cadres, had been simultaneously suspending classes at twenty-five high schools in the prefecture since 3:00 p.m. on the 17th, holding protest rallies.

The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the 17th stating that the Wakayama Prefecture Board of Education's punishment of cadres and members of the Wakayama Prefecture Teachers' Union and the Wakayama Prefecture High School Teachers' Union is an illegal suppression of people who oppose the "Amendment to the Police Officer Duty Execution Law" and the "performance rating" system. The Socialist Party demands the immediate revocation of this punishment.

The Socialist Party also decided to dispatch an investigation team to Wakayama on the 19th, with protest rallies centered around the Socialist Party branches in the prefecture.

In order to oppose the Kishida Nobusuke government's revision of the Police Law and its forced implementation of the "performance rating" system, the Japan High School Teachers' Union decided to suspend classes from 3:00 p.m. on November 2nd, and all union members will go to the streets to post slogans and conduct signature collection activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 18th: About eight hundred students from Waseda University held a protest rally on campus on the evening of the 17th, protesting the school authorities' unreasonable punishment of students who participated in the joint struggle against the Kishida Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law." The students believe that this punishment is an act of destroying the freedom of the university, so they decided to establish a struggle committee to demand that the school authorities revoke the punishment.

On the 17th, Waseda University punished ten students, including Ono from the third year of the Faculty of Political Science and Economics, who had participated in the struggle against the revision of the Police Law on November 5th, suspending them indefinitely. At the same time, another six students were given reprimands of suspension. (Attached picture)
