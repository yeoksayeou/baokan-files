Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 9th: Newspapers here today published editorials on Israel's recent infringement on Syrian territory.

    "Al-Jamahir" pointed out that without orders from Washington and London, Israel could not carry out any aggression. It said that the purpose of this infringement was to test the military deployments of the United Arab Republic as a prelude to launching a surprise attack.

    "Al-Nour" said that although Israel's infringement on the Arab demilitarized zone two days ago was not serious, there is sufficient evidence to prove that a series of activities had instigated Israel to carry out military provocations before it occurred. This newspaper mentioned the fact that the United States and Britain had transported large quantities of weapons to Israel before withdrawing their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, November 9th: Iraq's "Al-Hurriyah" commented on Israel's infringement on the Syrian border, pointing out that imperialism is responsible for the tensions generated in this region as a result. The newspaper said that the imperialists, who were forced to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, will not stop their conspiracies and plots against the Arabs, and therefore they used their traditional puppet Israel.

    The newspaper warned that all Arabs are prepared to face the war imposed on them by the imperialists and drive the imperialists out of every inch of Arab land.

    "Al-Yaqza" also commented on this issue, writing that the Arabs have now been liberated, and they are now concerned only with the interests of their people. If Israel and their imperialist masters do not understand this and dare to launch another aggression, they will surely understand it.

    中东舆论评以色列挑衅活动时指出
    美英是侵略活动的策划人
    新华社大马士革9日电　此间报纸今天就最近以色列侵犯叙利亚地区发表社论。
    “群众报”指出，没有华盛顿和伦敦的命令，以色列是不可能进行任何侵略的。它说，这次侵犯的目的是要试探阿拉伯联合共和国的军事部署，以作为发动突然进攻的前奏。
    “光明报”说，虽然以色列两天前对阿拉伯非军事区的侵犯并不严重，但是有充分证据证明，在它发生之前曾有一系列的怂恿以色列进行军事挑衅的活动。这家报纸提到美国和英国在把它们的军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦以前，曾经运给以色列大批武器的事实。
    新华社巴格达9日电　伊拉克“自由报”在评论以色列对叙利亚边界侵犯时，指出帝国主义要对由此而在这个地区产生的紧张局势负责。这家报纸说，被迫从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退的帝国主义者不会停止对阿拉伯人的阴谋和策划，因此它们就利用了它们传统的傀儡以色列。
    这家报纸警告说，所有的阿拉伯人都准备面对帝国主义者强加于他们的战争，并且把帝国主义者从阿拉伯的每一寸土地上赶出去。
    “觉醒报”也就这个问题发表了评论，它写道，阿拉伯人现在已经获得解放，他们现在关心的只是他们人民的利益。如果以色列和它们的帝国主义主子不明白这一点而胆敢发动另一次侵略，它们就一定会明白的。
