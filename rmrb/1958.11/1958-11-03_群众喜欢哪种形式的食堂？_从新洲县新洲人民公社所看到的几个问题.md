The Xinzhou People's Commune in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, has established 357 rural public canteens. More than 47,000 people eat in the canteens, accounting for 93.1% of the total population, basically realizing dining in the canteens. The peasants praise this situation as: The red flowers of communism are blooming, and a happy life has arrived. Now, people are using communist enthusiasm to care for and support this bud of communism, so that it can continue to develop and consolidate in the struggle against all old things and old ideas.

Facts have proved that the collectivization of life centered on canteens is not only an economic task, but also a political task. It is the biggest revolution in the lives of peasants. Therefore, the struggle between the two roads is also very sharp. Some people eat in the canteen but are still scheming at home; others think the canteen will not last long and secretly keep something for themselves; some rich middle peasants even hide grain and refuse to hand it over, which affects the canteen's ability to operate. Therefore, running rural public canteens well, so that commune members eat more, eat better, and live more happily than at home, has become a fundamental issue in doing a good job in production and consolidating the people's communes. In consolidating the public canteens, in addition to continuously strengthening political and ideological education and carrying out the two-road struggle, the scale, form, and some management systems of the canteens are worth further study to gradually improve them.

How Large Should a Canteen Be?

First, regarding the scale of the canteen. Among the 357 public canteens in the Xinzhou People's Commune, those with 10-20 households account for 19.6% of the total; those with 20-50 households account for 16.2%; those with 50-100 households account for 61.9%; and those with more than 100 households account for 2.3%. Most of these canteens were established at the same time as the establishment of the people's communes. Generally speaking, there are three situations: The first is organized with the original small production teams as units, which results in several canteens in one village, making it difficult to unify production actions, especially after the establishment of new production organizations, which is even more prominent. The second is organized with the village as the unit, without taking into account the original production units or the new production organizational forms. Regardless of the size of the village or the number of households, canteens are established based on the village. In this way, production and life are very inconvenient. For example, comparing the two canteens in Liuji Street and Xiren Village in the Fourth Brigade, the Liuji canteen has 112 households and employs one affairs director, one accountant, and eight cooks. The Xiren Village canteen only has 11 households and also employs one affairs director, one accountant, and two cooks. By comparison, the Liuji canteen has more than nine times the population of the Xiren Village canteen and is also responsible for supplying vegetables, using only ten people in total; while the Xiren Village canteen not only does not supply vegetables, but uses two people. This kind of canteen actually affects the further liberation of the productive forces. The third is organized with the new production team as the unit. This kind of canteen has many advantages and can unify production, life, and work. Generally speaking, it is most convenient to establish a canteen with the new production team as the unit in the plains area. In the hilly area, a canteen can be established with the village as the unit, but there should be a unified economic accounting system based on the new production team. If the village is too small, the villages should be merged to run the canteen together. From the current living conditions and leadership level, a general canteen with about 70-80 households or about 100 households is appropriate.

Which Form is Better?

Second, regarding the form of the canteen. Which form of canteen is easier to lead in production and more convenient for the masses in life? As far as the current situation is concerned, there are three forms. The first is selling meals but not selling vegetables. This kind of canteen is established in form, but in reality, each household is still cooking vegetables. The lifestyle of each household has not been completely changed, and women have not been completely liberated from trivial housework. The masses commented that this kind of canteen has four major drawbacks: 1. Commune members are suspicious and have disagreements; 2. The speed of eating is different, and attendance is uneven; 3. Each household makes vegetables, and they still argue about oil and salt money; 4. Women are not liberated, and the tail of private ownership still exists. It seems that the masses have opinions on this kind of canteen, and some places are changing this form. The second is selling meals and vegetables but not supplying water. Although this form is an improvement over the first form, the masses still feel unaccustomed to the lack of supply of boiled water and hot water. Some said: "After working for a day, I don't even have hot water to soak my feet. How can I live like this?" In order to change this situation, some places have improved the system in a timely manner, stipulating that each person should bring a pot of boiled water when going to the field, so that they can quench their thirst in time during work. However, some canteens have stipulated some unreasonable systems when supplying boiled water, such as stipulating that one fen should be paid for a bucket of boiled water, which is not appropriate. The third is supplying meals, vegetables, and water at the same time. This is a more advanced form. The Liuji canteen is run in this way, and the commune members say that it has five advantages: the water supply is good, the life is good, the cost savings are good, the family unity is good, and the hygiene is good.

In order to gradually develop the third form, some canteens in Xinzhou Commune have adopted some methods: 1. All private stoves in the family are demolished, and the public canteen sets up small stoves, or five households keep a small stove for the use of the masses. The masses have opinions on five households keeping a small stove, saying that there is a tail of private ownership; they are very supportive of the canteen running a small stove. For example, in the Liuji canteen, there is a 63-year-old Xia Haibo, who has been a bachelor for more than 20 years. In the past, when he was sick, he slept in bed and no one took care of him. This time, when he was sick, the canteen's small stove made him a bowl of shredded pork noodles. He held the noodles and said with a smile: "I have only eaten this bowl of noodles in my life, and it is as good as having a son." 2. With the canteen as the unit, all vegetable gardens are concentrated, and collective vegetable cultivation is implemented, and a professional vegetable team is established to achieve self-sufficiency and more than self-sufficiency. At the beginning, the Liuji canteen collectively planted 21 mu of vegetables and determined that six people were specifically responsible. Now, it can not only guarantee the supply of 600 jin of vegetables for eating every day, but also has vegetables for sale. They plan to reach 10,000 jin of vegetables per household, and 1 million jin for the entire canteen, which is a good plan to care for and improve the lives of the masses. 3. On the basis of doing a good job in collective vegetable cultivation, the canteen purchases commune members' live pigs, mobilizes commune members to invest or discount into the canteen, so as to achieve self-raising and self-eating. For example, the Liuji canteen improved its life twice in one month, eating braised fish once and steamed meat once, and the masses were very satisfied, and they worked harder.

Management system

Third, regarding some management system issues of the canteen. How to manage the rural public canteen well under the principle of eating enough, eating well, and not wasting, there are many specific issues worth studying and solving. Generally, there are the following issues:

1. How to implement democratic management? Making the canteen the masses' own canteen, and implementing democratic management in the economy, is an important key to consolidating the canteen work. According to existing experience, some have established a "Canteen Management Committee" or a "Food Committee." The more appropriate name should be "Canteen Management Committee." Generally, there are five to seven people. Under the leadership of the committee, all members should fully develop democracy, rely on the masses, and do a good job in the management of the canteen.

2. How to take care of the sick, the old, the young, women, and various people. The way the Liuji canteen solves these problems is: the sick are supplied with pasta by the canteen's small stove; women giving birth are subsidized with 5-6 jin of noodles per month, 1 jin of oil noodles, and 2 jin of oil tickets; children who are one year old are subsidized with 5-8 jin of grain and 1 jin of oil tickets; those who get married are subsidized with 20 jin of grain; those who have funerals are subsidized with 10-15 jin of grain; guests are subsidized with 12-15 meals per household per year, and large families are subsidized with 15-17 meals; this year, in order to take care of the habits of the masses, each person is subsidized with 4 jin of glutinous rice and 3 jin of oil noodles for the New Year. These subsidized grains are not supplied by the state, but are supplied by the canteen from the savings made on weekdays.

3. How to select management personnel in the canteen? The affairs director, accountant, cook, etc. who are specifically responsible for the work of the canteen, need to be carefully selected. They have an important relationship to consolidating the canteen.

The selection object of the affairs director should be a cadre or activist with high political awareness, strong working ability, and able to be selfless. His task is to manage all internal and external affairs in the canteen work, that is, to specifically implement the specific affairs work of the "Canteen Management Committee."

The conditions for the accountant, in addition to the conditions equivalent to those of the affairs director, should also add one, that is, able to write and calculate, and should be assumed by a very reliable person. The accountant should be in charge of accounts only, not money.

Some people think that the cook is a very heavy and dirty job, and they did not let the middle and poor peasants be the cook, but let the landlords and rich peasants be the cook; some also take turns on duty. However, the masses are very concerned about the selection of cooks. They require the selected cooks to be able to cook, pay attention to cleanliness, be diligent, have a good attitude, and have certain skills. It can be seen that the selection of cooks must not be sloppy, let alone let landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements be cooks.

4. How to do a good job in periodic settlement of accounts and timely publicize the canteen's accounts is a matter of considerable concern to the masses. The canteen of the Fourth Team of the Eleventh Brigade of Gugang has established six accounts, namely, grain receipt account, income account, expenditure account, daily life account, commune member current account, and fixed asset account. It is announced once a month. In this way, the response is very good.

    群众喜欢哪种形式的食堂？
    ——从新洲县新洲人民公社所看到的几个问题
    中共黄冈地委工作组
    湖北省新洲县新洲人民公社已办起三百五十七个农村公共食堂。在食堂吃饭的有四万七千多人，占总人口的93.1％，已基本实行了吃饭食堂化。农民赞述这种情景是：共产主义红花开，幸福生活已到来。现在，人们正以共产主义的热情来关心和扶持这个共产主义的萌芽，使它在同一切旧事物、旧思想的斗争中不断地得到发展和巩固起来。
    事实证明，以食堂为中心的生活集体化，不仅是一项经济工作，而且是一项政治工作，是农民生活中一场最大的革命，因此，两条道路的斗争表现得也很尖锐。有的人在食堂吃饭，心在家里打主意；也有的人认为食堂办不久，私自留一手；甚至有些富裕中农藏米不交，以致影响食堂停火。因此，办好农村公共食堂，使社员比在家里吃得饱、吃得好，生活得更美满，已成为当前搞好生产、巩固人民公社中的一个带有根本性的问题。在巩固公共食堂工作中，除了不断地加强政治思想教育和进行两条道路斗争外，对食堂的规模、形式以及一些管理制度等等问题，都值得进一步研究，使它逐步地完善起来。
    食堂的规模多大好？
    第一，关于食堂的规模问题。新洲人民公社三百五十七个公共食堂，十——二十户的占总数19.6％；二十——五十户的占16.2％；五十——一百户的占61.9％；一百户以上的占2.3％。这些食堂，大部分是在建立人民公社的同时建立的。一般地来说有三种情况：第一种是以原来小生产队为单位组织的，这样就形成了一个垸子几个食堂，生产行动难于统一，特别是新的生产组织建立以后，显得更为突出。第二种是以垸子为单位进行组织的，既未照顾原来生产单位，又未照顾新的生产组织形式，不论垸子多大，户数多寡，一律以垸子建立食堂。这样一来，生产和生活就很不方便了。如第四大队的刘集街和细任垸的两个食堂比较，刘集食堂有一百一十二户，占用了一个事务长，一个会计，八个炊事员。而细任垸食堂只十一户，亦占用了一个事务长，一个会计，二个炊事员。两者比较，刘集食堂人口比细任垸食堂大九倍多，还负责供应蔬菜，总共只用十人；而细任垸食堂不但未供应蔬菜，却用了二人。这种食堂实际上影响了生产力的进一步解放。第三种是以新的生产队为单位进行组织的，这种食堂好处很多，能将生产、生活、工作统一地结合起来。一般地说，平原地区以新的生产小队为单位建立食堂是最方便的，丘陵地区可以以垸子为单位建立食堂，但应有一个以新的生产小队为单位进行统一的经济计算制度。垸子太小了，应并垸合办食堂。从当前的居住条件、领导水平看，一般食堂以七、八十户或一百户左右为宜。
    哪种形式好？
    第二，关于食堂的形式问题。究竟哪种形式的食堂在生产上便于领导，生活上便利群众呢？就目前情况看，有三种形式。第一种是卖饭不卖菜。这种食堂形式上办起了，实际上各家还在冒烟做菜。以一家一户为单位的生活方式仍未彻底改变，亦未将妇女从琐碎的家务劳动中彻底解放出来。群众评述这种食堂有四大坏处：1．社员怀疑，互闹意见；2．吃饭快慢，出勤不齐；3．各家弄菜，仍吵油盐钱；4．妇女未解放，私有尾巴仍存在。看来，群众对这种食堂是有意见的，现在有的地方正在改变这种形式。第二种是卖饭菜，不供应用水。这种食堂，虽比第一种形式有所改进，但群众对无开水、热水供应，还感不习惯。有的说：“劳动了一天，想点热水泡脚都没有，这怎么过得？”为了改变这种情况，有的地方及时改进了制度，规定每人下畈时，带开水一壶，便于在劳动中及时解渴。但是，有的食堂在供应开水时，却规定了一些不合理的制度，如规定一分钱买一桶开水，这不妥当。第三种是饭、菜、用水同时供应。这是一种较高级的形式。刘集食堂就是这样办的，社员说它有五好：用水供应好，生活过得好，节约开支好，家庭团结好，讲究卫生好。
    为了逐步发展第三种形式，新洲社有些食堂采用了一些办法：1．家庭私有炉灶全部拆光，公共食堂设小灶，或五户留一小灶，以备群众使用。群众对五户留一小灶有意见，说有私有尾巴；对食堂办小灶很赞成。如刘集食堂有一位六十三岁的夏海波，打了二十多年单身汉，过去病了睡在床上无人照顾，这次病了，食堂小灶给他弄了一碗肉丝面，他端着面笑眯眯的说：“我一生也只吃到这碗面，有儿子也只有这样好。”2．以食堂为单位，菜园全部集中，实行集体种菜，成立专业蔬菜队，作到自种自给，自足有余。刘集食堂一开始就集体种了二十一亩地的蔬菜，确定六人专门负责，现在不但每天能保证供应六百斤的吃菜量，而且还有蔬菜出卖。他们计划达到每户蔬菜万斤，全食堂达一百万斤，这是一个关心和改善群众生活的好计划。3．在搞好集体种菜的情况下，以食堂为单位购买社员生猪，发动社员投资或者折价入食堂，作到自养自食。如刘集食堂在一月内，改善了两次生活，吃了一次烧鱼和一次蒸肉，群众很满意，生产越干越有劲。
      管理制度
    第三，关于食堂的一些管理制度问题。如何在吃饱、吃好，不浪费的原则下，管理好农村公共食堂，有很多具体问题值得研究解决。大体上，有如下几个问题：
    一、如何实行民主管理？使食堂成为群众自己的食堂，在经济上实行民主管理，是巩固食堂工作中的一个重要关键。据已有经验，有的成立了“食堂管理委员会”或“伙食委员会”，比较适宜的称呼，应是“食堂管理委员会”。一般是五至七人，在委员会的领导下，全体委员应充分发扬民主，依靠群众，搞好食堂的管理工作。
    二、如何照顾病、老、幼、妇以及各种人。刘集食堂解决这些问题的办法是：病人由食堂小灶供应面食；生孩子每月补助面五——六斤，油面一斤，油票二斤；小孩满周岁补助粮食五——八斤，油票一斤；结婚的，补助粮食二十斤；有丧事，补助粮食十——十五斤；客人，每户每年补助十二——十五顿，大家庭补助十五——十七顿；今年过年，为了照顾群众习惯，每人补助糯米四斤，油面三斤。这些补助粮食，不要国家供应，均由食堂在平日节约下来供应。
    三、如何选择食堂中的管理人员？具体负责食堂工作的事务长、会计、炊事员等人，均需认真地选择，他们对巩固食堂有着重要的关系。
    事务长的选择对象，应是政治觉悟高，工作能力强，能大公无私的干部或积极分子。他的任务，是管理食堂工作中内内外外一切事务，即是具体执行“食堂管理委员会”的具体事务工作。
    会计的条件，除了应与事务长具备相等的条件外，还应加一条，就是会写会算，应由一个非常可靠的人担任。会计应专管账，不管钱。
    炊事员，有些人认为这是一件很重很脏的活路，没有让中、贫农当，却叫地主、富农当了；还有的轮班值日。可是，群众对炊事员的选择是非常关心的，他们要求被选择的炊事员会弄饭、讲清洁、手脚勤、态度好，要有一定的技术。可见选择炊事员决不能马虎，更不能让地、富、反、坏分子当炊事员。
    四、如何作好定期结账，及时公布食堂账目，是群众相当关心的问题。顾岗十一大队四小队食堂，建立了六个账目，即领粮账、收入账、支出账、日常生活账、社员往来账、固定财产账。一月公布一次。这样，反映很好。
