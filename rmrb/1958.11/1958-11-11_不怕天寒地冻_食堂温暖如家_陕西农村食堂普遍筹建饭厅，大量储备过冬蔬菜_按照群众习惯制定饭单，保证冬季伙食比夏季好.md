    Not Afraid of the Bitter Cold: Dining Halls as Warm as Home
    Rural Shaanxi Dining Halls Universally Prepare Dining Rooms, Store Large Quantities of Winter Vegetables
    Meal Plans Made According to People's Habits, Ensuring Winter Food is Better Than Summer Food
    Xi'an, November 10th (reporter Zhu Bo) – With the severe winter approaching, more than 105,000 rural dining halls in Shaanxi Province have launched various winter preparations. People's Communes on the Guanzhong Plain, in the southern Shaanxi mountain areas, and on the northern Shaanxi plateau are working day and night to paper and repair houses, build thatched houses, store vegetables, and collect firewood, to ensure that commune members can eat well and stay warm even in the severe winter.

    Due to the rapid development of rural dining halls in Shaanxi Province, most dining halls have simple equipment and no dining rooms. In the warm weather of summer and autumn, people eat outdoors. Now that the weather is cold, the masses urgently demand a solution to the dining room problem. Party committees at all levels attach great importance to this issue, and secretaries or standing committee members personally lead working groups to go deep into the People's Communes. Based on local characteristics, they find ways to solve the problem of temporary dining rooms. In the Guanzhong Plain, where there are many houses, the general approach is to adjust existing houses to solve the dining room problem; a few People's Communes have also built simple houses for dining halls, or borrowed primary school classrooms as temporary dining rooms (without affecting student learning). Su Yaoxian, deputy secretary of the Xianyang County Party Committee, led a working group to the Five-Star People's Commune, where they worked with commune cadres to specifically study the winter preparations for the dining halls. Everyone unanimously agreed to adjust existing houses, solving the dining room problem for all dining halls (a total of more than 200). These houses have been renovated and expanded, single rooms have been connected, and small rooms have been expanded into large rooms, with new stoves built. For example, the dining hall of the Fourth Squad of the Fourth Brigade has more than 310 people eating there. Out of the seventeen rooms, three are used as kitchens, and the remaining fourteen have been renovated into three connected dining rooms, with more than forty square tables and benches (all borrowed from commune members). Assuming eight people per table, this can fully accommodate the more than 300 people in the squad. Each dining room also has a clay stove for commune members to warm themselves while eating, and can also provide them with boiling water. Lintong, Dali, Huaxian and other places have also adjusted commune members' houses to solve the dining room problem. The rural dining halls in Lintong County have also built new simple dining rooms. According to statistics from four People's Communes in the county, there are more than 2,100 simple dining rooms that have been built or are under construction. In the Qinling Mountains of southern Shaanxi, the Bashan mountain areas, and the northern Shaanxi plateau, where houses are scarce, most rural dining halls build simple thatched houses or sheds as temporary dining rooms. These mountainous areas are full of wild grass, bamboo, and firewood, and the people have experience in building simple thatched houses and sheds, so this method is very convenient.

    In carrying out the winter preparations for dining halls, all localities have paid attention to the winter living problems of the elderly, children, and the sick. There are many methods adopted in various places. Rural dining halls in Lintong County generally establish small stoves, with higher standards of supply and more varieties of food. Each dining hall also establishes a "connected kang" (a heated brick bed) for the elderly and children to warm themselves while eating. One "connected kang" can accommodate twenty to thirty people. In addition to setting up small stoves in the dining halls, the communes in Xianyang County also set up children's dining rooms. The Henan Street Kindergarten of the Five-Star Commune has established a dining hall and dining room for the more than 150 children in the kindergarten. The dining room is converted from three old rooms and has twenty-four five-foot-long and one-foot-high small dining tables, with small benches on both sides (all made from waste wood). This method has been enthusiastically supported by the masses. This not only allows the children to eat hot meals, but also ensures that the standard of food is higher than that of adults, and that they eat more meals (four meals a day), which is especially satisfying for the mothers.

    Dining hall managers in various places have proposed to make the food in winter even better than in summer and autumn. To achieve this goal, dining halls in various places have prepared large quantities of vegetables for use in winter. Except for remote mountainous rural dining halls, the general goal is to have one catty of vegetables per person per day. For example, dining halls in Liquan, Wugong, Chang'an, Xianyang and other counties have prepared sufficient vegetables and have dug cellars to store them, or have entrusted the vegetables to commune members for safekeeping. The various brigades of the Liquan Fire Beacon People's Commune have a total of nine dining halls, with more than 2,000 people eating, and have prepared more than 200,000 catties of various vegetables. Rural dining halls in various places have also proposed to formulate winter meal plans and menus according to the local people's eating habits in winter. For example, people in the Guanzhong area are accustomed to eating thin porridge (made of millet or corn), hot soup noodles, and "connected pot noodles" (noodles with corn) in winter, so the dining halls have drawn up meal plans based on this situation. Also, as the people of Guanzhong like to eat sauerkraut (made with pickled cabbage and turnip greens) and chili peppers, the dining halls have purchased a large batch of chili peppers and prepared several to a dozen large vats to make sauerkraut. Some communes have also set up wineries to make vinegar, soy sauce, pickled vegetables, tofu, and bean sprouts, specifically for the use of the dining halls.

    All localities are also paying attention to solving the problem of winter heating for commune members' families. The people on the Guanzhong Plain are accustomed to burning kangs (heated platforms), mainly using cotton stalks and corn stalks as firewood. Generally, one kang needs more than 1,000 catties of firewood for the entire winter. This year, more than twice as much firewood has been collected as in previous years, which can completely solve the problem of firewood for commune members' families. Now, the communes have begun to distribute firewood to the commune members, generally distributing two to three thousand catties to each household. In the Qinling mountain area, the communes have demarcated firewood mountains, generally assigning one mu of firewood mountain to ten households, and commune members are squeezing out time to chop firewood to prepare for winter heating.

    The winter preparations for rural dining halls in various parts of Shaanxi Province are progressing relatively quickly and smoothly, mainly because party committees at all levels have attached importance to this work. Secondly, all localities have paid attention to mobilizing the masses to conduct debates on the winter preparations for dining halls, resolving ideological obstacles to the problem of winter preparations for dining halls.

    不怕天寒地冻　食堂温暖如家
    陕西农村食堂普遍筹建饭厅，大量储备过冬蔬菜
    按照群众习惯制定饭单，保证冬季伙食比夏季好
    本报西安10日电　记者朱波报道：严冬即将到来，陕西省十万五千多个农村食堂，展开了过冬的各项准备工作。关中平原、陕南山区和陕北高塬的人民公社，正日夜糊裱房屋，修建草房，贮藏蔬菜，收集烧柴，以便保证社员们在严寒的冬天，也都能吃饱吃暖。
    由于陕西省农村食堂发展迅速，多数食堂的设备都很单简，没有饭厅。夏、秋两季天气温暖，群众都在露天里吃饭。现在天气寒冷了，群众迫切要求解决饭厅问题。各地县委都非常重视这个问题，由书记或常委亲自带领工作组，深入各人民公社，根据当地不同特点，找出解决临时饭厅的办法。关中平原房屋多，一般的都采取调整房屋的办法，解决饭厅问题；也有少数的人民公社为食堂修建了简单的房屋，或借用小学教室作为临时饭厅（不影响学生学习）。咸阳县委副书记苏耀先率领工作组，深入到五星人民公社，协同公社干部具体研究了食堂过冬的问题。大家一致同意调整房屋，解决了全部食堂（共二百多个食堂）的饭厅问题。这些房子都经过整修和扩建，把单间打通，把小房间扩建成大房间，并建立了新的炉灶。例如第四大队第四连的食堂，共有三百一十多个人吃饭，共十七间房子，除了三间作灶房外，其余十四间修成了相连的三个饭厅，共摆有四十多张方桌和凳子（都是借用社员的），每桌按八个人计算，完全可以容纳下该队三百多人吃饭。每个饭厅里还修了土炉，供社员吃饭时取暖，并且还可以供给社员开水。临潼、大荔、华县等地也都调剂社员的房屋解决了饭厅问题。临潼县的农村食堂还新建了简易饭厅，据该县四个人民公社统计，已建和正在建的简易饭厅共有二千一百多间。在陕南的秦岭，巴山山区和陕北高塬，由于房屋缺少，多数农村食堂都修建简易草房或草棚，作为临时饭厅。这些山区遍地都是野草、竹子和木柴，群众过去也有修建简单草房和草棚的经验，因此，采用这个办法非常方便。
    各地在开展食堂过冬的准备工作中，都注意了老人、孩子和病人的冬季生活问题。各地采取的方法很多，临潼县的农村食堂一般都建立了小灶，供应标准高一些，饭菜样数多，每个食堂还建立了连锅炕，供老人、孩子吃饭时取暖。一个连锅炕可容二、三十人。咸阳县各公社除了食堂建立小灶外，还建立儿童饭厅。五星公社河南街幼儿院，为该院一百五十多个儿童建立了一个食堂和饭厅，饭厅是三大间旧房改建的，共有二十四张五尺长一尺高小饭桌，两边摆着小条凳（都是利用废木材做的）。这个办法得到群众的热烈拥护。这样不仅使孩子吃到热饭，而且饭菜的标准比大人的高，吃的顿数也多（每天四顿饭），尤其是妈妈们更为满意。
    各地食堂管理人员都提出要把冬季里的伙食办的比夏季、秋季还好，为做到这一点，各地食堂都准备了大量的蔬菜，以备在冬季用。除了偏远的山区农村食堂外，一般都做到一人一天一斤蔬菜。例如醴泉、武功、长安、咸阳等县食堂都准备好足够的蔬菜，并都挖了存放蔬菜的地窖，或把蔬菜交给社员保管。醴泉烽火人民公社的各个大队，共有九个食堂，有二千多个人吃饭，共准备了二十多万斤各种蔬菜。各地农村食堂都还提出根据当地群众在冬季吃饭的习惯拟定冬季的饭单和菜单。例如关中地区的群众，冬季习惯吃稀粥（小米、玉米做的）、热汤面和连锅面（面条加玉米），食堂就根据这种情况订出了饭单；又如关中群众喜欢吃酸菜（用白菜、萝卜缨泡制的）和辣子，各食堂都购买了大批的辣椒，并准备了几个到十几个大缸，泡制酸菜。有的公社还开办了酿制厂，造醋、酱油、腌咸菜、做豆腐、豆芽等，专门供应各食堂用。
    各地还注意解决社员家庭的冬季取暖问题。关中平原上群众都有烧炕的习惯，主要用棉花秆、玉米秆作烧柴，一般的一个炕一冬天需要一千多斤烧柴。今年柴草比往年多收一倍以上，完全可以解决社员家庭用柴问题。现在，各公社都开始给社员分配烧柴，一般的每户分到二至三千斤。在秦岭山区，各公社都划分了柴山，一般都是十户分到一亩柴山，社员们正挤出时间打柴，准备冬季取暖用。
    陕西省各地农村食堂过冬的准备工作进展的比较迅速和顺利，这主要是各级党委重视了这一工作。其次是各地都注意了发动群众，对食堂过冬问题进行辩论，解决了食堂过冬问题的思想障碍。
