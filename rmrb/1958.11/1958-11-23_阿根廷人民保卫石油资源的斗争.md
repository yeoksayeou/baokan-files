    The Struggle of the Argentine People to Defend Oil Resources
    Zhang Ye
    In recent months, the Argentine people have been engaged in a resolute struggle to defend the country's oil resources. Because the Argentine government's contract with American oil monopoly capital to jointly exploit Argentine oil was scheduled to be formally signed on November 12, this struggle recently reached a new climax. Oil workers in Mendoza Province went on a large-scale strike from October 31 to protest the government's signing of oil contracts with foreign companies. Oil workers in Argentina's main oil field, "Comodoro Rivadavia," the Federation of Sixty-Two Trade Unions of the country, and patriotic people from a wide range of social strata all lent their support. On November 9, workers of the Argentine National Oil Monopoly Company held a conference and decided to hold a forty-eight-hour strike starting at zero hour on the 13th. Because of the discovery of a plot to overthrow President Arturo Frondizi on November 12, the domestic situation suddenly became tense. In order to avoid being exploited by reactionaries to create a coup situation unfavorable to the people and national interests, the oil union decided to postpone the originally decided general strike, and later decided to end the strike on the 18th.
    Faced with the magnificent people's movement to defend national oil resources, the Argentine government was forced on the one hand to announce the postponement of the signing date of the oil contract to thirty days later; on the other hand, under the pressure of domestic and foreign reactionaries, it announced the implementation of a month-long state of emergency across the country from November 11, ordered the striking oil workers to stop striking immediately, and conducted large-scale arrests across the country. Those arrested included many labor leaders and Communists.
    The Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party issued a statement on November 14 regarding the current domestic political situation, condemning the government's measures against the Communist Party, the working class, and the people, and supporting the oil workers' struggle against the signing of an agreement with American oil companies, as well as the struggle of the masses to protect Argentina's national wealth. The Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party demanded that the government end the state of emergency, release all those arrested, fully restore democratic freedoms, immediately revise the contract with American companies, delete clauses that harm the national economy and national sovereignty, and stipulate that oil workers who strike in protest against the agreement signed with American oil companies should not be persecuted.
    Rich in Oil Reserves
    Argentina is the second largest country in Latin America and has abundant underground oil resources. Proven oil reserves are estimated at 500 million cubic meters. Based on the current annual consumption of 14 million cubic meters, it is enough for Argentina to use for thirty-six years.
    However, Argentina's rich oil resources have not benefited the Argentine people. On the one hand, it is precisely because of the rich oil reserves that they have aroused the covetousness and plunder of imperialism, especially American imperialism. Imperialism has tried every possible means to exploit Argentina's difficulties, using methods such as refusing to give "aid," not selling oil machinery and equipment, and controlling Argentina's foreign trade to force it to cede its oil mining rights. On the other hand, due to American imperialism's efforts to hinder the development of Argentina's national oil industry and Argentina's own lack of funds and technical equipment, most of Argentina's oil resources have not been exploited, and therefore it has to import large quantities of oil from foreign countries every year. According to Frondizi's statement on the oil issue on July 24, in 1957, out of the 14 million cubic meters of oil consumed in Argentina, about 10 million cubic meters were imported from foreign countries. In order to import so much oil, Argentina spent about 300 million US dollars in foreign exchange, which was nearly the trade deficit of 1957. Frondizi believes that dependence on foreign countries in terms of fuel and steel has become a "major obstacle to progress" in Argentina and "puts Argentina's sovereignty in a dangerous situation." The statement proposed that oil self-sufficiency must be achieved.
    Wrong Conclusion
    However, how to solve the problem of Argentina's oil self-sufficiency? In his statement, Frondizi proposed some measures to rely on foreign capital, mainly American loans and American monopoly capital, to develop and produce Argentine oil. The statement also announced that the Argentine government had reached an agreement with a series of foreign oil companies to conclude contracts for jointly exploiting Argentine oil. The total amount of investment provided by these companies to Argentina is about 1 billion US dollars, of which the "American Group" led by Atlas Company will provide 790 million US dollars in investment.
    After Frondizi's statement on the oil issue was published, it aroused strong opposition from the Argentine people. The Argentine Communist Party issued a statement the day after the statement was published (July 25), accusing the government of taking measures favorable to imperialism on the oil issue. The statement pointed out that Frondizi drew wrong conclusions from the correct premise he put forward. The statement pointed out that this is "a plan to serve the imperialist companies at the expense of the country." Socialist leader Palacios criticized the government's oil agreement with foreign companies at a mass rally of tens of thousands of people held in Buenos Aires. He demanded that Frondizi pursue a policy of safeguarding Argentina's national interests. Even Baigori, a member of the National Assembly of the ruling Intransigent Radical Civic Union, condemned the American companies for wanting to obtain huge profits through this agreement.
    Ceding Oil Rights
    Frondizi was elected president in the general election in February this year with the support of patriotic and democratic forces including the Communist Party. The Argentine working class and people voted for Frondizi because he put forward an election platform that conformed to national interests and the demands of the people. An important item in this platform was to protect the country's oil resources and nationalize the development of oil. Since taking office on May 1 this year, Frondizi, with the support of domestic progressive forces and the broad masses of the people, has done some good things that are beneficial to democracy and national interests and defeated the reactionary plot of a coup. However, on the other hand, under the increasingly intensified pressure from American imperialism and domestic reactionaries, he has shown wavering, compromise, and concessions. Insisting on signing an oil contract with foreign companies despite the opposition of the people across the country is an example.
    Although Frondizi emphasized in his statement on the oil issue that the government would never give new oil concessions to others, and submitted a bill to the National Assembly for discussion at the end of August to nationalize oil deposits. However, allowing the most predatory American monopoly capital to jointly exploit oil is just ceding oil concessions under a not-so-subtle disguise. Because in the current situation of awakening of the people of all countries, American imperialism cannot force concessions as before, but has to wear a mask and use forms such as "aid" and "investment cooperation" to deceive the people. From loans to "aid," from direct investment to mixed joint-stock companies and investment in capital goods, from running oil concessions itself to "serving" the invaded country. Although the forms are different, the essence is always the same: plundering rich raw material wealth, grabbing huge profits, interfering in their internal affairs, and other political and military aggression activities that follow. According to an editorial in Argentina's "Times" on November 14, the coup plot in Argentina on November 12 was manufactured by American imperialism. The "Times" emphasized that the American oil trust creating a chaotic situation in Argentina was to "find an excuse for foreign intervention and to install agents and protectors of oil monopoly capital in the highest positions."
    Ruthless Plunder
    From the content of the contracts signed with American companies announced by the Argentine government and newspapers, we can fully see the ferocious face of American monopoly capital's ruthless plunder of Argentine oil. First of all, the price of American companies' investment in oil exploration is much more expensive than the investment in oil exploration by the Argentine Oil Deposit Administration. Taking drilling as an example, the investment of American companies requires a total of 120,000 US dollars for each oil well drilled, which is equivalent to 7.2 million pesos in Argentine currency, while the cost of drilling an oil well by the Argentine Oil Deposit Administration is only 1.5 million pesos, a difference of 5.7 million pesos. According to the contract, 4,000 oil wells are to be drilled. Then, Argentina will have to spend 22.8 billion pesos more just on drilling. In addition, the contract also stipulates that American companies will export 2.8 million cubic meters of oil to Argentina in two years, and can double it if necessary, that is, increase to 5.6 million cubic meters. This is actually still using foreign exchange to import oil, rather than solving the problem of oil self-sufficiency. More importantly, the Argentine government's allowing American monopoly capital to jointly exploit oil is tantamount to letting a wolf into the house, which facilitates the infiltration of American oil monopoly capital.
    Sharp Contrast
    At the time when the Argentine people's struggle to defend national oil resources entered a climax, the Soviet government signed an agreement in Moscow on October 27 to provide Argentina with machinery and equipment for the oil industry with preferential loans of 400 million rubles (equivalent to 100 million US dollars). The agreement stipulates that the annual interest rate on the loan is 2.5%, and the loan utilization period is three years. The Argentine government will start repaying with Argentine goods three years after receiving each batch of machinery and equipment, and the repayment period is seven years, with equal annual repayments.
    The Soviet Union's loan agreement to help Argentina develop its oil industry forms the sharpest contrast with the American monopoly capital's joint oil exploitation contract to plunder Argentina's oil resources. Jose Liceaga, head of the Argentine trade delegation who negotiated and signed the loan agreement with the Soviet Union, said in an interview with a reporter from the Soviet "Izvestia," "The Soviet Union does not want to force us to accept any conditions, whether political, economic, or financial. Our negotiations were conducted on the basis of mutual benefit and complete equality." He emphasized that this was the first agreement signed in his country's history under such favorable conditions.
    The Soviet Union's loan to Argentina was warmly welcomed by Argentine and Latin American public opinion. Argentina's "Clarin," "Razon," "El Mundo," and "The Times" all published Liceaga's talks. "Clarin" emphasized in its commentary that the agreement signed between Argentina and the Soviet Union "was signed under particularly favorable conditions for our country (Argentina). … The Soviet representatives expressed complete understanding of the problems currently facing Argentina, and expressed their willingness to contribute to solving these problems, and will prove this with their actions." Argentine business and political figures believe that this agreement is of great significance to the further development of the national economy. And pointed out the correct way to solve the problem of Argentina's oil self-sufficiency. The signing of this agreement shows that at present, the Frondizi government is still wavering between the right and wrong paths. The characteristics of the Argentine political situation are that the pressure from American imperialism and the Argentine right wing on the Frondizi government is still great, but the Argentine patriotic and democratic forces are also strengthening their struggle. The struggle of Argentine oil workers to defend national oil resources is precisely a demonstration of this trend.

    阿根廷人民保卫石油资源的斗争
    章叶
    最近几个月以来，阿根廷人民为保卫国家石油资源，进行了坚决的斗争。由于阿根廷政府同美国石油垄断资本缔结的共同开采阿根廷石油的合同，曾预定在11月12日正式签字，最近这一斗争达到了新的高潮。门多萨省的石油工人为抗议政府同外国公司签订石油合同，从10月31日起举行了大罢工。阿根廷主要油田“科莫多罗—里瓦达维亚”的石油工人，和全国六十二个工会联合会以及广泛阶层的爱国人士，都给以支持。11月9日，阿根廷国家石油专卖公司的工人召开大会，决定从13日零时起举行四十八小时的罢工。由于11月12日阿根廷发现了企图推翻阿图罗·弗朗迪西总统的阴谋，国内局势突趋紧张，为了免被反动派所利用以造成不利于人民和民族利益的政变局势，石油工会决定把原来决定的总罢工推迟举行，后来又在18日决定停止罢工。
    面对着波澜壮阔的保卫国家石油资源的人民运动，阿根廷政府一方面被迫宣布把石油合同的签字日期推迟到三十天以后；另一方面，在国内外反动派的压力下，又宣布从11月11日起在全国实行一个月的紧急戒严，命令罢工的石油工人立即停止罢工，并在全国范围内进行了大规模的逮捕，被捕的人包括很多劳工领袖和共产党人。
    阿根廷共产党中央委员会11月14日就当前国内政治形势发表声明，谴责政府采取反对共产党，反对工人阶级和人民的措施，支持石油工人为反对同美国石油公司签订协定而进行的斗争以及人民大众保护阿根廷民族财富的斗争。阿根廷共产党中央委员会要求政府结束紧急状态，释放所有被逮捕的人，完全恢复民主自由，立即修改同美国公司的合同，删除其中有损国家经济和民族主权的条款以及规定不迫害为抗议同美国石油公司签订的协定而罢工的石油工人。
    油藏丰富
    阿根廷是拉丁美洲的第二大国，地下蕴藏着丰富的石油资源。已经查明的石油蕴藏量估计有五亿立方公尺。按目前每年消耗一千四百万立方公尺计算，足够阿根廷三十六年之用。
    但是，阿根廷的丰富石油资源，并没有能造福阿根廷人民。一方面，正是由于丰富的石油蕴藏量，引起了帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义的垂涎和掠夺。帝国主义千方百计地利用阿根廷的困难，用不给“援助”，不卖给石油机器和设备、控制阿根廷的对外贸易等手段，迫使它出让自己的石油开采权。另一方面，由于美帝国主义竭力阻挠阿根廷民族石油工业的发展以及阿根廷本身缺乏资金和技术设备，阿根廷的石油资源大多没有开采，因而每年不得不从外国大量进口石油。据弗朗迪西在7月24日发表的石油问题文告中说，在1957年，阿根廷所消耗的一千四百万立方公尺的石油中，从外国进口的约有一千万立方公尺，为了进口这么多的石油，阿根廷大约花了三亿美元的外汇，这笔开支将近1957年的贸易赤字。弗朗迪西认为，在燃料和钢的方面对外国的依赖，已经成为阿根廷“进步的主要障碍”，并且“把阿根廷的主权置于危险的境地”。文告提出，必须做到石油的自给自足。
    结论错误
    但是，怎样解决阿根廷石油自给自足的问题呢？弗朗迪西在他的文告中提出一些依靠外国资本，主要是依靠美国贷款和美国垄断资本来开发和生产阿根廷石油的措施。文告并且宣布，阿根廷政府已经同一系列的外国石油公司就缔结共同开采阿根廷石油的合同达成协议。这些公司为阿根廷提供的投资总额约为十亿美元，其中以阿特拉斯公司为首的“美国集团”将提供七亿九千万美元的投资。
    弗朗迪西关于石油问题的文告发表后，引起阿根廷人民的强烈反对。阿根廷共产党在文告发表的第二天（7月25日）就发表一项声明，指责政府在石油问题上有利于帝国主义的做法。声明指出，弗朗迪西从他提出来的正确前提下，得出了错误的结论。声明指出，这是“以帝国主义公司为本国服务的计划”。社会党领袖帕拉肖斯在布宜诺斯艾利斯举行的有好几万人参加的群众大会上抨击政府同外国公司签订的石油协定，他要求弗朗迪西奉行保卫阿根廷民族利益的政策。甚至执政党不妥协公民激进联盟的国民大会议员拜戈里也谴责说，美国公司想通过这个协定获得高额利润。
    出让油权
    弗朗迪西是今年2月大选时，在包括共产党在内的爱国民主力量支持下当选总统的。阿根廷工人阶级和人民投票选举弗朗迪西，是因为他提出了符合民族利益和人民要求的竞选纲领。这个纲领中的重要一项就是保卫国家石油资源，由国家垄断石油的开发。弗朗迪西从今年5月1日就任以来，在国内进步力量和广大人民群众的支持下，做了一些有利于民主和民族利益的好事，击败了反动派的政变阴谋，但是，在另一方面，在美帝国主义和国内反动派的日益加紧的压力下，表现了动摇、妥协和让步。不顾全国人民的反对执意同外国公司签订石油合同，就是例证。
    弗朗迪西虽然在他的关于石油问题的文告中强调政府决不再给别人以新的石油租让权，并且在8月底把石油矿藏国有化的法案提交国民大会讨论。但是，这种让最富掠夺性的美国垄断资本共同开采石油，只是在一种不怎么巧妙的伪装下，出让石油租让权罢了。因为在目前各国人民觉醒的形势下，美帝国主义不能像以前一样强行租让，而不得不带上假面具，用“援助”和“投资合作”等形式去欺骗人民。从贷款变为“援助”，从直接投资变为混合股份公司和资本货的投资，从自己经营石油康采恩变成为被侵略的国家“服务”。形式虽然不同，本质却永远是一个：掠夺丰富的原料财富，攫取高额利润，干涉它们的内政，以及随之而来的其他政治和军事侵略活动。据阿根廷“时报”11月14日的一篇社论揭露，11月12日阿根廷的政变阴谋就是美帝国主义所制造的。“时报”强调指出，美国石油托辣斯在阿根廷制造混乱局势是为“外国的干涉寻找借口和把石油垄断资本的代理人及保护者安插在最高职位上”。
    残酷掠夺
    从阿根廷政府和报纸公布的同美国公司签订的合同内容，也可以充分看出美国垄断资本对阿根廷石油残酷掠夺的凶恶面目。首先，美国公司投资开采石油的价格比阿根廷石油矿藏管理局的投资开采石油的价格昂贵得多。以钻井为例，美国公司的投资每钻一口油井共需十二万美元，折合阿根廷货币为七百二十万比索，而阿根廷石油矿藏管理局钻一口油井的成本仅一百五十万比索，相差五百七十万比索之巨。根据合同要钻四千口油井，那末，单是钻井一项，阿根廷就要多花二百二十八亿比索。此外，合同还规定，美国公司在两年中将向阿根廷出口二百八十万立方公尺的石油，必要时可以增加一倍，即增加到五百六十万立方公尺。这实际上还是用外汇去进口石油，而不是解决石油的自给自足问题。更重要的是阿根廷政府让美国垄断资本共同开采石油，无异是引狼入室，便利了美国石油垄断资本的渗入。
    鲜明对比
    正是在阿根廷人民保卫国家石油资源的斗争进入高潮的时候，苏联政府以四亿卢布（合一亿美元）的优惠贷款，向阿根廷提供石油工业机器和设备的协定，10月27日在莫斯科签字。协定规定，贷款年利为二厘五，贷款利用期限为三年。阿根廷政府在接到每批机器设备三年后开始用阿根廷货物偿还，偿还期限为七年，每年偿还数量相等。
    苏联帮助阿根廷发展石油工业的贷款协定同美国垄断资本掠夺阿根廷石油资源的共同开采石油合同，形成一个最鲜明的对比。同苏联谈判和签订贷款协定的阿根廷贸易代表团团长何塞·利塞阿加接见苏联“消息报”记者时说，“苏联不想强迫我们接受任何条件，无论是政治的，经济的，或是财政的。我们的谈判是在互利和完全平等的基础上进行的”。他强调指出，这是他本国历史上在这样有利条件下签订的第一个协定。
    苏联对阿根廷的贷款，受到阿根廷和拉丁美洲舆论的热烈欢迎。阿根廷的“号角报”、“理性报”、“世界报”、“时报”都发表了利塞阿加的谈话。“号角报”在评论中强调指出，阿苏两国签订的协定“是在对我国（阿根廷）特别有利的条件下签订的。……苏联代表表示完全理解目前摆在阿根廷面前的问题，他们并表示愿意为解决这些问题作出自己的贡献，并将以自己的行动来证实这一点。”阿根廷的工商界和政界人士认为这个协定对国家经济进一步发展具有重大的意义。并指出了解决阿根廷石油自给自足问题的正确道路。这个协定的签订表明，目前，弗朗迪西政府仍然在正确的和错误的道路上摇摆不定。阿根廷政治局势的特点是，美帝国主义和阿根廷右派对弗朗迪西政府的压力还很大，但是，阿根廷爱国民主力量也正在加强自己的斗争。阿根廷石油工人保卫国家石油资源的斗争，正是表明了这一趋势。
