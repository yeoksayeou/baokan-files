    Female Militia Team
    In Kanmen Town, located on the southern coastal defense line of Zhejiang, women were already undertaking the task of supporting the front lines just like men in the early days of Liberation. Some even stood guard and kept watch alongside the militia teams, but there wasn't a single official female militia member in the militia team. Despite repeated requests from the women, everyone felt that the coastal defense struggle was very arduous and worried that the women wouldn't be able to endure it, so they were never allowed to participate. This year, when American imperialism created tension in the Taiwan Strait, the women once again put forward the request to join the militia. They said: Defending our hometown is everyone's business. How can we defend our hometown together with the men if we don't practice our skills well? Seeing their great determination, the town leaders approved the establishment of a female militia company of one hundred and forty-six people. This boosted their enthusiasm even more. During the three militia training sessions, the female militia members, like the male militia members, braved the hot summer sun every time and persisted in shooting practice while crawling on the ground. During the first live-fire shooting practice, among the seventy-eight female militia members, forty-eight scored "excellent," and the female militia members of the Fourteenth Village even became a "shooting all-red village."

    女民兵队
    浙江南部海防线上的坎门镇的妇女，在解放初期就和男子一样担负支援前线的任务。有的还跟着民兵队一起站岗放哨，但是民兵队里却没有一个正式的女民兵。妇女们虽一再要求，但大家觉得海防斗争非常艰苦，耽心妇女们吃不消，始终没有让她们参加。直到今年，当美帝国主义在台湾海峡制造紧张局势后，妇女们又提出了参加民兵的要求。她们说：保卫家乡是大家的事，我们不练好本领怎么能够和男子一起保卫家乡呢？镇领导上看到她们决心很大，便批准她们成立了一个有一百四十六人的女民兵中队。这一下她们劲头更大了，在民兵的三次集训中，女民兵们和男民兵一样，每次都冒着夏天火热的太阳，爬在地上坚持射击练习。在第一次进行实弹射击练习时，七十八个女民兵中，有四十八个人打了“优秀”，十四村的女民兵还成为“射击满堂红村”。
