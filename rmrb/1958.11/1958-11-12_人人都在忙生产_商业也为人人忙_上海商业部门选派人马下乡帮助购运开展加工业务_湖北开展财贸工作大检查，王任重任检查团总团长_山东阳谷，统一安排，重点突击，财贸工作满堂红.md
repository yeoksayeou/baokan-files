Shanghai Commercial Departments Select Personnel to Go to the Countryside to Help Purchase, Transport, and Develop Processing Businesses
Hubei Launches a Comprehensive Inspection of Financial and Trade Work, Wang Renzhong Serves as the Head of the Inspection Team
Shandong Yanggu, Unified Arrangement, Focus on Key Points, Financial and Trade Work Achieves Overall Success

(By our newspaper, Shanghai, November 11) Amidst the current upsurge of large-scale purchases of agricultural and sideline products in rural areas, Shanghai's commercial departments are actively supporting the purchasing activities in various regions from all aspects.

Shanghai, as an industrial base and foreign trade port, requires a large amount of industrial raw materials, non-staple foods, and export goods from various regions. This year, the country has seen an unprecedented bumper harvest of agricultural products, and the task of purchasing is heavy. Therefore, relevant commercial units in Shanghai regard supporting the purchasing in production areas as an important task, rather than passively waiting for the purchase and allocation from various regions.

In the recent period, Shanghai has successively dispatched more than 2,000 commercial personnel to various production areas to organize sources of goods. Many people directly participated in the local purchasing teams, assisting with weighing, inspection, warehousing, and escorting. The commercial personnel sent to Binghui, Quanjiao, and Lai'an in Anhui Province shared a part of the local pig procurement tasks. They helped raise the purchased pigs and often walked hundreds of miles to drive the pigs to the transfer points, alleviating the difficulty of insufficient local labor. Shanghai commercial personnel with specialized expertise brought samples with them when they went to the countryside, teaching quality identification techniques for agricultural and sideline products in various places. Personnel from the Shanghai Cotton Company exchanged cotton grading technology with local personnel in Hangzhou and Cixi, Zhejiang Province; personnel from the Native Produce Export Company introduced methods for inspecting the quality of local products such as dried chili peppers in Sichuan and Hunan, improving the technical level of purchasing agents in these regions. Many cadres sent by Shanghai also specifically helped some regions develop processing businesses for various agricultural and sideline products such as cured meat.

Shanghai's commercial departments actively supported the transportation of agricultural and sideline products from various regions. A group of cadres was stationed at transfer points, stations, and docks in various places to help receive and deliver goods. Personnel from the Shanghai Grain, Oil and Fats Export Company stationed in Guangde County, Anhui Province, made a special trip to Zhejiang Province to borrow a batch of wooden boats, promptly helping Guangde County to transport grain. Although the commercial departments in Shanghai currently feel that their own transportation tools are insufficient, they still dispatched some trucks, handcarts, and tugboats to participate in the transportation of agricultural and sideline products in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, and Fujian and other regions.

The quantity of agricultural and sideline products purchased in various regions this year is enormous, requiring a large number of packaging materials. Shanghai's commercial departments are also making great efforts to help in this regard. Since the launch of new cotton and new tobacco, the commercial departments here have vigorously carried out the recovery of packaging materials for cotton and tobacco leaves, supplying them to ten provinces including Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, and Henan and the rural areas in the suburbs of Shanghai. In addition, Shanghai has also supported various regions with a batch of processing equipment such as cotton ginning machines, baling machines, and rubber rollers for rice milling machines in the recent period.

(By our newspaper) The Hubei Provincial Party Committee organized an inspection team and decided to organize a province-wide inspection of financial and trade work in early December.

The inspection team is headed by Wang Renzhong, Zhang Tixue, and Zhao Xinchu as the general and deputy heads. Each prefectural party committee establishes an inspection sub-team. The inspection team is composed of cadres drawn from various provincial units and prefectural, municipal, and county party committees, as well as personnel in charge of finance and trade. This inspection mainly focuses on the following:

(1) The unified purchase, processing, storage, and transportation of grain, cotton, and oil, as well as the grain supply for urban industrial and mining areas and large and medium-sized reservoir construction sites.

(2) The supply of market materials, especially the supply of means of production and livelihood for supporting the iron and steel production campaign and the autumn harvest, winter planting, deep plowing, and water conservancy movement.

(3) The purchase of local specialties and waste products, especially the purchase of live pigs, ramie, tea, waste steel, copper, tin, and lead.

(4) The supply of cash to the market during the peak season, organizing the withdrawal of currency, collecting overdue agricultural loans, bonds, advance purchases, and sales on credit, and further developing urban and rural savings deposits.

(5) The completion of the state's various fiscal revenues, especially the completion of industrial and commercial taxes and the income of central and local enterprises, to ensure the supply of funds for iron and steel production and winter farmland water conservancy.

The Provincial Party Committee proposed that in the process of inspecting the above tasks, it is necessary to simultaneously check the situation of each department's diligence and thrift in running enterprises, diligence and thrift in running all undertakings, and carrying out technological revolution and cultural revolution, as well as strengthening the leadership of the Party, implementing the mass line (democratic management system), and political and ideological work (competition and evaluation).

(By our newspaper, Jinan, November 11) News of a comprehensive great leap forward in financial and trade work has come from Yanggu County, Shandong Province. As of October 24, the unified purchase of grain, the requisition of cotton, the purchase of waste steel, taxation, savings, bonds, recovery of loans, insurance, the purchase of live pigs, and the organization and assistance to the masses in developing pig raising, manufacturing local fertilizers, local pesticides, and fire saltpeter, a total of thirteen tasks, have been completed or exceeded the annual plan. Among them, the task of unified purchase of grain was completed by 136.2%, and the requisition of cotton was completed by 100.3%.

The county's early and comprehensive completion of financial and trade tasks is the result of the Party committee strengthening leadership and vigorously organizing a comprehensive leap forward. The Party committees at all levels first grasped political leadership, and through airing views, debates, and clearing away various right-leaning conservative ideas that "focusing on the center cannot focus on business," all financial and trade personnel correctly recognized the close relationship between central work and business work, and established a new style of going deep into the lower levels and into reality.

In terms of organization and leadership, the Party committees at all levels adopted the method of unified organization, unified arrangement, focusing on key points, and driving others, using all available gaps to launch a concentrated effort in financial and trade work. Since the end of September, the county has relatively concentratedly organized three blitz campaigns. The first time was when the early autumn harvest and deep plowing were basically completed and the late autumn harvest had not yet fully started. A total of 110,000 people and thousands of vehicles were mobilized, and more than 30 million jin of grain unified purchase tasks were completed in one day and night. The second time was when autumn planting was basically completed and cotton was entering the market in large quantities. 42,000 students and elderly women were mobilized to pick cotton, and 35,000 laborers were engaged in transportation. On October 23, picking and purchasing were done simultaneously in one day, and a total of more than 3 million jin of ginned cotton were purchased, exceeding the cotton requisition task, and tasks such as recovering loans, bonds, savings, and insurance were also completed. The third time was before the basic drying of spring sweet potatoes and the start of the rush harvest of late sweet potatoes, a blitz was launched for one day to purchase more than 10 million jin of dried sweet potatoes, and the masses were mobilized to raise pigs and complete the live pig purchase plan. These blitz campaigns were all carried out during production gaps and made full use of the strength of the masses, so not only was the task completed quickly, but after the blitz, it was more conducive to doing a good job in production with all our strength.

    人人都在忙生产　商业也为人人忙
    上海商业部门选派人马下乡帮助购运开展加工业务

    山东阳谷，统一安排，重点突击，财贸工作满堂红
    本报上海11日电　在当前农村大购农副产品的高潮中，上海商业部门积极从各方面支援各地的收购活动。
    上海这个工业基地和对外贸易口岸，需要各地提供大量的工业原料、副食品和出口货源。今年全国农产品空前丰收，收购任务繁重。因此，上海有关的商业单位把支持产区收购作为自己的一项重要任务，而不是坐待各地收购后调拨。
    近一时期来，上海陆续派出了二千多名商业人员，分赴各地产区组织货源。很多人直接参加了当地的收购队伍，帮助过磅、验收、进仓和押运。派往安徽省炳辉、全椒、来安三地的商业人员，分担了当地一部分生猪的采购任务。他们帮助饲养收购来的生猪，经常徒步几百里把猪赶到转运点，减轻了当地劳动力不足的困难。有经营专长的上海商业人员，下乡时带去了样品，在各地传授农副产品的质量鉴别技术。上海棉花公司人员在浙江省的杭州、慈溪，同当地有关人员交流了棉花分等分级的技术；土产出口公司人员在四川、湖南等地，介绍了辣椒干等土产品的验质方法，提高了这些地区采购员的技术水平。上海派出的不少干部还具体帮助一些地区开展了腌腊肉等各种农副产品的加工业务。
    上海商业部门积极支援了各地农副产品的运输。有一批干部专驻在各地的转运点和车站、码头上，帮助接送货物。上海粮谷油脂出口公司派在安徽省广德县的人员，专程奔赴浙江省，借调了一批木船，及时帮助广德县运出粮食。目前上海商业部门自备的运输工具虽然感到不足，仍然派出了部分卡车、手推车和拖轮，参加江苏、浙江、山西、福建等地的农副产品的运送。
    各地今年收购的农副产品数量庞大，需要大批的包装材料，上海商业部门也尽很大努力在这方面进行帮助。新棉、新烟登场以来，这里的商业部门大力开展了棉花、烟叶的包装材料回收工作，供应江苏、山东、河北、河南等十个省和上海郊区农村。此外，上海近一时期来还支援了各地一批棉花轧花车、打包机、轧米机橡皮滚筒等加工设备。
    本报讯　中共湖北省委组织检查团，决定在12月初组织全省财贸工作大检查。
    检查团由王任重、张体学、赵辛初同志分任总、副团长。每个地委成立检查分团。检查团人员由省直各单位及地、市、县委抽调干部和财贸负责人员组成。这次主要检查以下几个内容：
    （一）粮、棉、油的统购、加工、保管、储运工作及城市工矿地区与大中型水库工地的粮食供应问题。
    （二）市场物资供应工作，特别是支援钢铁元帅升帐和秋收、冬播、深耕、水利运动的生产资料和生活资料供应工作。
    （三）土特产、废品的收购工作，特别是生猪、苎麻、茶叶、废钢铁、铜、锡、铅的收购工作。
      （四）旺季市场现金供应，组织货币回笼，收回到期农贷、公债、预购、赊销款，进一步开展城乡储蓄存款工作。
    （五）完成国家的各项财政收入情况，特别是完成工商税和中央、地方企业收入，保证钢铁生产和冬季农田水利的资金供应情况。
    省委提出在检查以上几项工作的过程中，必须同时结合检查每一个部门勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业和开展技术革命、文化革命的情况，以及加强党的领导，贯彻群众路线（民主管理制）和政治思想工作（竞赛评比）等问题。
    本报济南11日电　山东省阳谷县的财贸工作传来全面大跃进的喜讯。到10月24日，粮食统购、棉花征购、收购废钢铁、税收、储蓄、公债、收回贷款、保险、收购生猪以及组织与帮助群众发展养猪、制造土化肥、土农药、火硝十三项任务都已完成或超过全年计划，其中粮食统购任务完成了136.2％，棉花征购完成了100.3％。
    这个县提前全面完成财贸任务，是党委加强领导，大力组织全面跃进的结果。各级党委首先抓住了政治挂帅，通过鸣放辩论扫清了认为“搞中心就不能搞业务”的各种右倾保守思想，使全体财贸人员正确地认识到中心工作与业务工作的密切关系，并且树立了深入下层、深入实际的新风气。
    在组织领导上，各级党委采取了统一组织、统一安排、重点突击、带动其他的方法，利用一切可以利用的空隙，突击开展财贸工作。从9月下旬开始，全县比较集中地组织了三次突击运动。第一次是在早秋抢收和深翻地基本结束、晚秋收获尚未全面展开的时候，一共发动了十一万人，几千辆车，一昼夜完成了三千多万斤的粮食统购任务。第二次是在秋种基本结束、棉花大量登市时，发动了四万二千名学生和老年妇女摘拾棉花，三万五千名劳动力搞运输，在10月23日一天之内随摘拾、随收购，一共收购了皮棉三百多万斤，超额完成了棉花征购任务，同时还完成了收回贷款、公债、储蓄、保险等任务。第三次是在春地瓜基本晒完、晚地瓜开始抢收之先，突击一天收购地瓜干一千多万斤，同时还发动群众养猪和完成生猪收购计划。这几次突击运动，都是在生产空隙，并且充分发挥群众的力量，因而不仅任务完成得快，而且在突击之后，更有利于全力搞好生产。（附图片）
