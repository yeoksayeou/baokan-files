Xinhua News Agency, November 13th, Boston Dispatch: An article by the "Christian Science Monitor" reporter Stanford, published on November 6th, pointed out that the Democratic majority in the new U.S. Congress will "continue to support" the Republican government's basic foreign policy, and will only cause Dulles some trouble on the "tactics" of foreign policy.

The reporter actually admits that the Democratic and Republican parties are birds of a feather, writing, "Democrats have been among the most consistently supportive of many of President (Eisenhower)'s basic foreign policy propositions," and Eisenhower's basic foreign policies are "inherited from previous Democratic administrations." Therefore, the Democratic Party's "influence" on the Republican government will only be "in the execution and handling of foreign affairs," rather than "in basic foreign policy issues."

The reporter predicted, "In the coming months, the Democratic majority will have a psychological (not a concrete) restraint on Secretary of State Dulles." "It can also be safely assumed that, due to the Democratic Party's overwhelming majority, the Republican government will feel obliged to consult more fully with the opposition party earlier."

However, the reporter wrote, "What will be subject to special scrutiny by the Democrats in the future is less President Eisenhower's guidance of foreign policy than Mr. Dulles's approach to implementing foreign policy." He said that Dulles's "tactics in foreign affairs have always been the object of Democratic criticism and aversion."

The reporter pointed out that the "Two Chinas" conspiracy that the Republican government has been conducting recently is an example of this change in "tactics." The reporter pointed out that the U.S. government had to make this change because Dulles "discovered" in the election that there was "so much opinion" in public opinion about his "tactics" of provoking war over the issue of the Chinese coastal islands, and that his and other Republican leaders' (such as Eisenhower and Nixon) defense of these "tactics" "seemed to have produced only a very small effect, if any."

    美两党外交政策基本相同
    美报认为民主党将继续支持共和党政府
    新华社13日讯　波士顿消息：美国“基督教科学箴言报”6日刊载的该报记者斯坦福的一篇文章指出，美国新国会中的民主党多数，对共和党政府的基本外交政策将会“继续给予支持”，而只会在外交政策的“战术”上给杜勒斯找些麻烦。
    记者实际上承认民主党和共和党都是一丘之貉，他写道，“民主党人一直是最一贯地支持总统（艾森豪威尔）的许多基本外交政策主张的人们中的一批”，而艾森豪威尔的这些基本外交政策又都是“从以前的民主党政府那里继承下来的”。因此，民主党对共和党政府的“影响”将只是“在外交事务的执行和处理方面”，而不是“外交政策的基本问题方面”。
    这位记者预料道，“在未来的几个月中，民主党的多数对国务卿杜勒斯将有一种心理上的（倒不是具体的）约束”。“人们还可以肯定地认为，由于民主党取得了这种巨大的多数，共和党政府将会感到自己必须更早地同反对党进行更充分的磋商。”
    但是，这个记者写道，“在将来会受到民主党特别检查的，与其说是艾森豪威尔总统对外交政策的指导，不如说是杜勒斯先生执行外交政策的做法。”他说，杜勒斯在“外交事务方面的战术，一直是民主党批评和厌恶的对象”。
    这位记者指出，共和党政府最近一直在进行的“两个中国”的阴谋，就是这种改变“战术”的做法。记者指出，美国政府不得不作这种改变，也是由于杜勒斯在选举中“发现”舆论界对他要在中国沿海岛屿问题上进行战争挑衅的“战术”竟然有“这么多的意见”，而他和共和党其他首脑（如艾森豪威尔和尼克松等）为这种“战术”所进行的辩护“似乎只产生了极其微小的作用，如果说有任何作用的话”。
