The further away, the clearer
    Lin Ling

Lenin said: The further the October Revolution is from us, the more clearly we see its great significance. The October Revolution is forty-one years away from us, and we indeed understand its great significance more clearly year by year. The October Revolution is a correct revolutionary road. Whoever follows this road will be able to achieve victory in the revolutionary struggle. The farther away, the more victories will be achieved, and the closer it gets to communist society. Since this year, Argentine comrades have commemorated the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Argentine Communist Party; Finnish comrades have commemorated the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Finnish Communist Party; Greek comrades have commemorated the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Greek Communist Party; now, German comrades are commemorating the 40th anniversary of their November Revolution and the founding of the German Communist Party; Hungarian comrades are preparing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Hungarian Soviet Revolution in March next year; Austrian comrades are also commemorating the 40th anniversary of the national strike and the initial establishment of the Soviets in 1918; China is preparing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. Various countries are preparing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist International in March next year. By next year and the year after, there will be more of these great "fortieth anniversary" commemorations.

In fact, which country's working class and working people in the world have not more or less been influenced by the October Revolution and raised the red flag of revolution? The light of the October Revolution illuminated the path of struggle for the working people all over the world. This struggle has different experiences in different countries, but their direction is consistent. Although in many countries, the working people have not yet become masters; however, under the guidance of the light of the October Revolution, they are bound to achieve the final victory sooner or later. From this point, we can better understand why the October Revolution is a new era in human history, why November 7, 1917, is a watershed in human history, and why the revolutionary history of many countries must begin on this day.

This great significance of becoming clearer the further away it is can also be proved by some specific facts. One example is that the October Revolution itself was directly participated in by the working class of various countries, including the names of Chinese laborers.

In the snow-covered Moscow, on the glorious Red Square, in the solemn purple-red granite mausoleum, rests the great Lenin. Behind Lenin's Mausoleum, at the foot of the Kremlin wall, is a fraternal cemetery of revolutionary soldiers, in which are buried the revolutionary heroes who sacrificed in the Moscow October Uprising. Among these revolutionary heroes are two Chinese comrades. According to the recollections of two old Soviet Bolsheviks, these two Chinese heroes were both workers in a Moscow building materials factory. They also remembered the Russian names of these two Chinese workers, one named Huaxia and the other named Kolia. They both died heroically when charging the Kremlin.

This historical fact is still being further explored. But these bits of material already tell us how deep the revolutionary friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is. As early as forty-one years ago, the representatives of the Chinese and Soviet proletariats demonstrated the noblest spirit of internationalist fighting solidarity. If we recall how many Chinese workers participated in the fighting during the Soviet Civil War and sacrificed heroically, and how many Soviet comrades dedicated their lives to the Chinese revolution, we will be even more inspired by this spirit of internationalism and more clearly see the great significance of the path of unity and cooperation pioneered by the revolutionary martyrs.

After the October Revolution, Lenin attached great importance to the revolutionary struggles of the people of Eastern countries. He repeatedly met with representatives of workers from various Eastern countries. In one meeting with the Mongolian shepherd Sukhbaatar, who later became the founding father of the Mongolian People's Republic, there were several Chinese workers present. The continued exploration of these materials will be of great significance for studying the historical facts of Lenin's guidance of revolutions in various countries at that time.

From these far from exhaustive materials, we can already see how enormous the international significance of the October Revolution is, how great Lenin's role as the international proletarian revolutionary teacher was, and how profound the fighting friendship between the working people of China and the Soviet Union is. The great day of the October Revolution is already forty-one years away from us, but the farther away it is from us, the clearer its significance, its influence, its role, and its achievements become. It will become even clearer in the future.

    愈远愈清楚
    林陵
    列宁说过：十月革命离开我们愈远，我们就愈加清楚地看出它的伟大意义。十月革命离开我们四十一年了，我们确实一年比一年更清楚地了解它的伟大意义。十月革命是一条正确的革命道路，谁循着这条道路走，谁就能取得革命斗争的胜利，愈来愈远，也就愈多取得胜利，愈加接近共产主义社会。今年以来，阿根廷同志纪念了阿根廷共产党成立四十周年；芬兰同志纪念了芬兰共产党成立四十周年；希腊同志纪念了希腊共产党成立四十周年；现在，德国同志正在纪念他们十一月革命四十周年和德共成立四十周年；匈牙利同志正在筹备纪念明年三月里的匈牙利苏维埃革命四十周年；奥地利同志也在纪念1918年全国大罢工和最初成立的苏维埃四十周年；中国正在准备纪念五四运动四十周年。各国正在准备纪念明年3月间的共产国际成立四十周年。到明年，后年，这种伟大的“四十周年”的纪念更多。
    事实上，世界上哪一个国家的工人阶级和劳动人民，不是或多或少地受了十月革命的影响而举起革命的红旗的呢？十月革命的光芒，照亮了全世界劳动人民斗争的道路。这个斗争，在不同的国家里有不同的经历，但是，他们的方向是一致的。尽管在还有不少的国家里，劳动人民还没有成为主人；但是，在十月革命的光芒的指引下，他们迟早是一定要取得最后的胜利的。我们从这一点更可以了解，为什么十月革命是人类历史的新纪元，为什么1917年11月7日是人类历史的分水岭，许多国家的革命历史要从这一天写起。
    这种愈远愈清楚的伟大意义，还可以从一些具体事实中得到证明，例子之一就是：十月革命本身，是有各国工人阶级直接参加的，其中也有中国劳动者的名字。
    在白雪皑皑的莫斯科，在光辉灿烂的红场上，在庄严肃穆的紫红色花岗石陵墓里，安眠着伟大的列宁。在列宁陵后面，在克里姆林宫城墙脚下，有一个革命战士的兄弟墓，里面安埋着在莫斯科十月起义中牺牲的革命英雄，在这些革命英雄中有两位是中国同志。据两位苏联老布尔什维克回忆，这两位中国英雄都是莫斯科一个建筑材料工厂的工人，他们还记得这两位中国工人的俄文名字，一个叫华夏，一个叫柯里亚，他们都是在冲击克里姆林宫时英勇牺牲的。
    这一史实还在进一步地发掘中。但这点滴的材料已经告诉我们：中苏两国人民的革命友谊多么深厚，远在四十一年前，中苏两国无产阶级的代表就表现了最高尚的国际主义战斗团结的精神。如果我们再回忆一下，有多少中国工人在苏联内战时参加战斗而英勇牺牲，又有多少苏联同志在中国革命事业中献出了自己的生命，我们就更加为这种国际主义精神所感奋，更加清楚地看出革命先烈所开辟的团结合作的道路的伟大意义了。
    十月革命发生后，列宁非常重视东方各国人民的革命斗争，他曾屡次接见东方各国工人代表谈话。在一次接见后来成为蒙古人民共和国开国元勋的蒙古牧人苏赫巴托时，在座的就有几个中国工人。这些材料的继续发掘，将对于研究当时列宁指导各国革命的史实，有重大意义。
    从这些远不完尽的材料中，我们已经可以看出十月革命的国际意义多么巨大，列宁所起的国际无产阶级革命导师的作用多么伟大，中苏两国劳动人民的战斗友谊多么深远了。十月革命这伟大的日子离开我们已经四十一年了，可是它离开我们愈远，它的意义，它的影响，它的作用，它的成就，却愈来愈清楚。以后还会更加清楚。
