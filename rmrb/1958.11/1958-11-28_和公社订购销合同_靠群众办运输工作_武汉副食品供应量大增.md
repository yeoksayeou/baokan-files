Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 27th: Wuhan's commercial departments have adopted measures such as signing purchasing and sales contracts with people's communes and adopting transportation methods like breaking bulk into smaller lots and making use of every available space, comprehensively improving the market supply of goods.

In the past month, the supply of various major non-staple foods in Wuhan has increased significantly. The supply of Chinese cabbage and fresh fish has increased by one to two times compared to a month ago. Wild rice stems, leeks, and carrots are regularly available. On average, each person can eat nearly one pound of fresh vegetables per day. The meat supply is good, with pork available throughout the day in all vegetable markets based on rationing. Recently, more than two hundred fresh sheep have been available daily. For some varieties with relatively scarce supply, such as bean products, vegetable markets allocate them to neighborhoods according to proportion, or increase the number of stalls to supply them, thus basically eliminating the phenomenon of queuing and crowding. Some vegetable markets are even open all night, selling to customers as they come.

For winter supplies, commercial departments have also made proper arrangements, having organized hundreds of thousands of bamboo poles and two million reed mats to supply construction sites for building sheds. The cotton wadding, cotton batting, and cotton clothing prepared by department stores can be fully supplied.

In the previous period, the supply of some daily necessities in the Wuhan market was relatively tight. After research by the commercial departments, it was believed that this was mainly due to the labor force in the countryside being relatively strained after the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and agricultural and sideline products could not enter the city. The commercial departments also had the mentality of "waiting for goods to be delivered," and did not take the initiative to go deep into the countryside to purchase and transport goods. In response to this situation, Wuhan's commercial departments decided to designate November as a month for concentrated purchasing, organizing more than 1,200 purchasing agents to purchase agricultural and sideline products from various places. The purchasing agents went deep into the countryside, signing purchasing and sales contracts with people's communes, opening up a large number of sources of goods. The Municipal Vegetable Company alone has signed contracts for 180 million catties of vegetables with people's communes, enough for the city's population to eat this winter and next spring. The Sichuan purchasing team of the Municipal Native Produce Company signed a contract with the local people's commune for 100,000 umbrellas, which not only helped the commune sell its sideline products, but also solved the problem of insufficient umbrella supply at steel construction sites in the city. In the process of purchasing, they closely relied on the masses, entrusting the work of grading, inspecting, weighing, packaging, and short-distance transportation of products to the communes, which greatly increased the purchasing volume. For example, the amount of Chinese cabbage, potatoes, and radishes purchased recently in Heilongjiang, Henan, and other places has increased by ten to fifteen times compared to the same period last year.

The purchasing agents also used various ingenious transportation methods such as breaking bulk into smaller lots and making use of every available space, to transport the purchased materials to Wuhan as quickly as possible. They took advantage of the fact that large stations had a lot of goods waiting to be transported and it was difficult to load vehicles, while some small stations had fewer goods, so they divided the goods into batches and sent them to small stations to compete for railway car loading. Not long ago, the Municipal Native Produce Company purchased hundreds of thousands of catties of apples in Liaoning Province. If they were transported all at once at a large station, it would take five railway cars to transport them all. The purchasing agents divided the apples into three batches and sent them to three nearby small stations, and they were quickly transported to Wuhan. For some sideline foods with smaller purchase volumes, such as seafood and dried and cured products, they implemented decentralized packaging and combined them with other units' goods waiting to be transported, which also allowed the goods to be transported out earlier. In addition, they also paid close attention to the use of civilian transportation tools, relying on the local masses to transport goods. The Municipal Vegetable Company purchased nearly 40 million catties of radishes in Yunmeng County, which were quickly transported to Wuhan by civilian boats.

### 和公社订购销合同　靠群众办运输工作  武汉副食品供应量大增

    和公社订购销合同　靠群众办运输工作
    武汉副食品供应量大增
    新华社武汉27日电　武汉市商业部门采取和人民公社签订购销合同以及化整为零、见缝插针等运输办法，全面改善了市场物资供应工作。
    近一个月来，武汉市各种主要副食品的供应量已增加很多，大白菜、鲜鱼比一个月前增加一倍到两倍，茭白、韭菜、红萝卜等都能经常保持供应；平均每人每天可以吃到近一斤鲜菜。肉食供应情况良好，各个菜场整日有猪肉按定量供应；近来每天还有二百多头鲜羊肉上市。部分货源较少的品种如豆制品等，菜场按比例分配给街道，或增设摊位供应，因而基本上消灭了排队拥挤现象。部分菜场还做到通宵营业，随来随卖。
    对于过冬物资，商业部门也作了妥善安排，已经组织到几十万根楠竹和二百万条芦席，供应工地搭盖工棚。各百货商店准备的棉絮、卷花、棉服，都可以充分供应。
    武汉市场前一时期部分生活资料供应比较紧张。经商业部门研究，认为这主要是由于工农业大跃进后，农村劳动力比较紧张，农副产品进不了城；商业部门又存在“坐等货源上门”的思想，没有主动深入到农村去进行收购、调运。针对这种情况，武汉市商业部门确定以11月份为突击采购月，组织了一千二百多个采购员，到各地采购农副产品。采购员们纷纷深入农村，和人民公社签订购销合同，开辟了大量货源。仅市蔬菜公司就已经和人民公社签订一亿八千万斤蔬菜合同，足够全市人民今冬明春食用。市土产公司四川采购组和当地人民公社签订了十万把雨伞合同，既帮助公社推销了副业产品，又解决了市内钢铁工地雨伞供应不足的问题。在采购过程中，他们紧紧依靠群众，把产品的分等、检验、过秤、包装、短途运输等工作，交给公社来办，使采购量增加很多。如最近在黑龙江、河南等地采购的大白菜、土豆、萝卜，都比去年同期增加十倍到十五倍。
    采购员们还用化整为零、见缝插针等多种多样运输上的巧办法，把采购到手的物资尽快地运到武汉。他们根据大车站待运物资很多，装车有困难，而有的小车站物资较少的特点，把物资分成几批，分头送往小车站，争取车皮装运。不久前，市土产公司在辽宁省采购了几十万斤苹果，如果在大车站上一次调运出去，需要五个车皮才能运完。采购员们把苹果分成三批，分头送往附近三个小车站，结果很快就运到了武汉。有些采购量较少的副食品如海味、干腌制品，他们便实行分散包装和其他单位的待运物资合伙装车，也使商品能提早运出。此外，他们还十分注意利用民间运输工具，依靠当地群众调运物资。市蔬菜公司在云梦县采购的近四千万斤萝卜，通过民船很快地就运到了武汉。
