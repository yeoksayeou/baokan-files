　　　Eight years of hard battle to subdue "Yellow Dragon" (flowing sand),

A Jiangnan-like scene of crisscrossing canals and lush vegetation has appeared in Dengkou County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a place beyond the Great Wall.

Dengkou County, which won the national title of Model in Afforestation, has basically controlled the flowing sand rushing from the Tengger Desert after eight years of arduous struggle. The more than 150 kilometers of shelterbelt, the more than 1.9 million mu of sand-fixing and grass-cultivation area, the more than 30 kilometers of windbreaks and wind barriers, and the 43 canals leading to the desert have tamed the wind and storms, and layer by layer blocked the path of the rolling flowing sand. Under the protection of this green Great Wall, the people of all ethnic groups in Dengkou County reaped an unprecedented bumper harvest for the first time this year. This year, the county is expected to have a grain yield of 450 jin per mu, realizing the grain target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (draft) nine years ahead of schedule; the net increase in livestock is more than 24%; and the direct income from forestry is about 190,000 yuan.

Dengkou County faces the Yellow River in the east and is surrounded by sand on three sides. The entire county is like a belt tightly attached to the edge of the Tengger Desert. Before liberation, due to the large-scale looting and destruction of forests by imperialists and reactionaries, the vast flowing sand was like a runaway horse, rolling eastward. In the past forty years, it has been verified that there were fourteen villages submerged by the flowing sand. Farmland close to the desert was even more barren, yielding nothing. The people of all ethnic groups on the wind and sand line lived a miserable life of "the desert ruthlessly presses on the good fields, forcing people to move their homes."

After liberation in 1949, the men, women, and children of Dengkou County, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, broke the superstitious thinking of "Yellow Dragon Wind God" and rose up to declare war on the flowing sand. Starting in 1951, the county has continuously launched a large-scale sand control movement. Based on the law that flowing sand "likes one thing and fears three" (likes wind, fears trees, fears grass, fears water), the masses vigorously carried out activities of planting trees, cultivating grass, and diverting water to irrigate the sand. Over the past eight years, more than 30,600 people in the county have planted more than 93,000 mu of trees, cultivated more than 1.9 million mu of grass, and irrigated more than 200,000 mu of desert, not only saving the county's 180,000 mu of farmland from being encroached upon by flowing sand, but also protecting tens of millions of mu of grassland in the northeastern part of Alxa League.

In this battle to conquer the desert, young people and women of all ethnic groups are the most active force. They have organized more than 220 organizations such as "Greening Commando Teams" and "Afforestation Expedition Teams." Every afforestation season, they carry their luggage, dry food, and tools into the sand, set up camps, and work hard day and night. Heroic model figures have emerged continuously. Chang Dala (Communist Party member), a 72-year-old national forestry labor model, in addition to helping Mongolian farmers plant trees, spends almost every day of the year running around in the forest area, sometimes even staying overnight in the forest area to guard the trees. The sand-fixing wind barriers created by the late Wu Chenggong, a national forestry labor model, are being promoted throughout the county. Guo Sanyuan, a member of the Shuguang People's Commune with paralyzed legs, often rides a donkey to inspect the forest area and sometimes crawls on the sand to chase away livestock that harms the trees. A new atmosphere of afforestation and tree care has been formed in Dengkou County, and children over ten years old have learned the techniques and knowledge of afforestation and forest protection.

Now, a larger-scale autumn afforestation movement of "ten thousand people and a thousand horses" has begun. On the more than 300-li-long sand line, people are preparing the land, watering, transporting, and planting seedlings. They will not only further subdue the flowing sand but also open up a new path for transforming and utilizing the desert. (Attached picture)

    八年苦战伏流沙
    新华社记者　秦继仑
    东临黄河西靠沙，
    造林育草好办法，
    苦战八年“黄龙”（流沙）伏，
    绿树丛中有人家。
    一幅渠道纵横，草木葱茂的江南景象，已在塞外的内蒙古自治区磴口县里出现了。
    荣获全国造林模范称号的磴口县，经过八年的艰苦奋战，现在已经基本控制了从腾格里大沙漠飞奔而来的流沙。全县营造起的一百五十多公里的防护林带，一百九十多万亩的封沙育草区，三十多公里的风墙风障和引向沙漠的四十三条渠道，已经驯服了风暴，并层层拦住了滚滚流沙的去路。磴口县的各族人民，在这片绿色长城的卫护下，今年第一次取得了空前大丰收。今年全县预计亩产粮食四百五十斤，提前九年实现了农业发展纲要（草案）所规定的粮食指标；牲畜纯增24％以上；林业的直接收入约达十九万多元。
    磴口县东临黄河，三面环沙，全县像一条带子紧贴在腾格里沙漠的边沿上。解放前，由于帝国主义和反动派大量对林木的掠夺破坏，使漫漫流沙如脱缰之马，滚滚东侵。近四十年中，已经查明被流沙淹没的村庄，就有十四处。靠近沙漠的农田更是十种九空，颗粒无收。风沙线上的各族人民就这样常年过着“沙漠无情压良田，逼得人们把家搬”的苦难生活。
    1949年解放后，磴口县的男女老幼，在各级党委的领导下，大破“黄龙神风”的迷信思想，奋起向流沙宣战。从1951年开始到现在，全县持续地开展了一个大规模治沙运动。群众根据流沙“一喜三怕”（喜风，怕树、怕草、怕水）的规律，大力开展了造林、育草和引水灌沙活动。八年来，全县三万零六百多人，造林九万三千多亩，育草一百九十多万亩，并灌溉沙漠二十多万亩，不仅使全县十八万亩农田免遭流沙侵袭，并保护了阿拉善旗东北部的千万亩草原。
    在这场征服沙漠的战斗中，各族青年和妇女是一支最活跃的力量。他们组织了二百二十多个“绿化突击队”和“造林远征队”等组织，每到造林季节，就背着行李、带着干粮和工具进入沙滩，安营扎寨，日夜苦战。英雄模范人物不断涌现，七十二岁的全国林业劳动模范常大拉（共产党员），除了帮助蒙古族农民植树造林外，几乎一年到头每天在林地里奔波，有时还夜宿在林地，看守林木。全国林业劳动模范武成功（已故）创造的固沙风障，正在全县推广。曙光人民公社双膝残废的社员郭三元，也经常骑上毛驴到林地里巡视检查，有时还爬行在沙滩上，追逐危害林木的牲畜。造林爱林的新风气，已经在磴口县形成，十多岁的孩子都学会了造林护林的技术和知识。
    现在，一个规模更大的“万人千马”秋季造林运动已经开始。在三百多里的沙滩线上，人们正在整地、浇水、运输和栽种苗木。他们不但要进一步制伏流沙，并且为改造和利用沙漠，开拓崭新的道路。（附图片）
