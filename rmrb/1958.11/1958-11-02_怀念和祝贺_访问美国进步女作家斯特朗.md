Remembering and Congratulating
——Visiting American Progressive Writer Anna Louise Strong
Xinhua News Agency reporters Yu Minsheng and Yuan Mu

    Anna Louise Strong, the silver-haired American progressive writer, stood up from her seat in her living room and excitedly took out a gray silk lambskin coat from the closet. Strong excitedly told the reporters that Marshal Lin Biao had given her this coat when she visited the Liberated Areas of China in 1946. For more than ten years, this old friend of the Chinese people has carefully preserved this memorable gift and wears it every winter after returning to the United States to commemorate the meaningful days she spent in China.
    Seventy-one-year-old Strong visited China five times from 1925 to 1947, writing many news reports and progressive books introducing the Chinese revolution. She said that she brought Marshal Lin Biao's fur coat back with her this time to wear it through the winter in China. She expressed her desire to introduce the situation of the new China to the American people more and better.
    Strong had a friendly conversation with reporters for an hour and a half in a bright and spacious living room in the Beijing Hotel. Her entire conversation was filled with infinite nostalgia for old friendships and expressed enthusiastic congratulations on the great construction achievements of the new China.
    "As an old friend of the Chinese people, I have been hoping to return to China for more than ten years. I miss the cities and villages I once visited, and I miss my old Chinese friends," Strong said to the reporters in an excited tone, expressing her feelings for the Chinese people. "And when I return to the China I have been thinking about today, I see 650 million hardworking and brave Chinese people, and I see the unparalleled and amazing miracles they have created."
    She put on her glasses, opened two folders, carefully flipping through the many reports and articles about China that she had written for American newspapers and magazines since she came to China this time, and read a section of it to us:
    "Without a doubt, the greatest renaissance in history is taking place here. The speed of China's construction is so amazing that everything anyone writes seems outdated!"
    Strong was afraid that we would not understand the meaning of her report, so she particularly extended it, saying, "It is almost difficult to accurately write down anything that is happening in China, because in the short time you are writing, the matter has changed greatly from the original. For example, today you visit a people's commune, and people will give you free steamed buns to eat, and tomorrow when you go to this people's commune, people may give you free clothes to wear!"
    "Six hundred and fifty million people, everyone is happy, everyone is smart, and they are all working hard towards a common goal. Even the cadres work during the day and participate in steelmaking at night. I have never seen such vigorous and energetic people!" When she talked about this, the expression on her face was so happy.
    Strong is a person with rich writing experience. In her more than 30 years of journalistic and writing career since 1922, in addition to reporting on the situation in the Soviet Union and China, she has also reported on the Spanish Civil War, the Warsaw Eastern Front campaign and the liberation of Poland, as well as the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and other major historical events. It seems that the earth-shattering things happening in China have deeply moved her. In Strong's living room, we saw many English books and newspapers introducing the situation of the new China. Among the many materials she had personally clipped, various classification labels were carefully pinned on them with tacks. As we looked around her living room, she talked to us about the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and the Yangtze River Bridge, and also about the water conservancy construction in Henan Province. She said in a tone of praise: "These are all peaceful constructions, and China is advancing by leaps and bounds!"
    We asked her to talk about the friendship of the American people towards the Chinese people. Strong fell into contemplation. At this time, we saw a layer of melancholy appear on her face.
    "The anti-China policy implemented by the American authorities prevents people from correctly understanding China." Strong's tone was low, and pain was tormenting her.
    After a while, the old woman became active again. She said: "However, the general American people have a traditional friendship with the Chinese people, and they all know that the Chinese are hardworking and capable."
    Strong opened a letter she had just received from the United States. The letter said that the American people had written many letters to Eisenhower, and four out of every five letters opposed the US government's policy on the Taiwan issue. Strong said: "The vast majority of Americans believe that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the United States has no reason to interfere in China's internal affairs. Minister Peng Dehuai's several communiques are very wise, and they are of great educational significance to the American people, because these communiques make it very clear that the issue between China and Chiang Kai-shek is entirely China's internal affair, and they can make the American people understand more clearly that Dulles's interference in China's internal affairs is completely unjustified."
    Speaking of this, we couldn't help but think of Mao Zedong's meeting with Strong in Yan'an more than ten years ago. At that time, Strong was the first to report Mao Zedong's famous assertion that "all reactionaries are paper tigers" to the people of the world. We asked Strong what she thought when she revisited Mao Zedong's words at that time after more than ten years.
    "It was considered very correct at the time, and after more than ten years of events, it seems even more correct now."
    Unforgettable memories brought the famous American progressive writer back to the historic day when Chairman Mao met her. She appeared more active, trying her best to recall the many brilliant assertions Mao Zedong had made to her back then, and repeating them to us: Superficially, American imperialism is the most vicious, but in reality, it is the weakest; although the American buildings are tall, their foundations are shaky; it is not the atomic bomb that will destroy mankind, but mankind that will eventually destroy the atomic bomb;... Strong then repeated her own view, saying, "All of Chairman Mao's pronouncements were not only completely correct at the time, but the subsequent historical developments have all confirmed his brilliant foresight."
    Although Strong is over seventy years old, she is still energetic and very talkative. She especially vividly remembers Yan'an, the holy land of the Chinese revolution, which she visited. When talking about some old friends she met in China back then, she was filled with joy and could not suppress her inner excitement. Strong picked up a faded grass-green woolen handbag from the coffee table in front of the sofa and showed it to us, telling us that it was given to her by female comrades in Yan'an in the second year after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The following words are embroidered on the handbag with white silk thread:
    To Mrs. Strong
    Presented by the Second Nursery of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in the Chinese Liberated Area
    August 15, 1946
    In Strong's view, even such a small handbag condenses the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards her, an ordinary American. That's why she has carefully preserved it for more than ten years.
    Strong also pointed to a pair of cotton pants she was wearing and told us: "These are also the cotton pants I wore in Yan'an back then!" On closer inspection, there were many small holes in the surface of these black silk cotton pants, revealing bits of white cotton. Even so, she treasures them, because they are a pair of cotton pants that condense friendship!
    "For more than ten years, I have been hoping to come to China again. Now that I have come to China, I really can't bear to leave her again!" Strong continued with friendly affection: "What makes me most happy is that the spirit of Yan'an back then, that close relationship of comrades, that ever-upward revolutionary vigor, and that blood-and-flesh relationship between revolutionaries and the people, are not only still maintained today, but have also been further developed."
    "You didn't expect China to change so quickly when you were in Yan'an, did you?" The memory of friendship made our conversation more harmonious and intimate, and we couldn't help but ask her this.
    "I believed at the time that the Chinese revolution would definitely be victorious, but I never thought that China would be built so quickly after victory!" Strong said excitedly in poetic language: "On the reviewing stand in front of Tiananmen Square on October 1st, I saw an extremely moving and great scene. A quarter of the world's people are so hardworking, and they control their own destiny. I once again felt that the safety and peace of mankind were guaranteed!"
    Strong then smiled and said to us that when she watched the fireworks on the Tiananmen Gate Tower on the evening of the "Eleventh," she met with comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Lu Dingyi, and others. Strong said: "When I saw Chairman Mao and many old friends from Yan'an in an instant, I really couldn't express the impulse in my emotions."
    Finally, the reporter asked her, "What do you plan to write about this time you come to China?" Strong thought for a while and said: "I don't plan to write about the entire new China, because China is developing too fast, and things will have developed again before the book is published. I would like to write about the development of a county's people's commune, because the people's commune is the new cell that best represents China's great future. By doing so, maybe I can better reflect the face of China!"
    When we said goodbye, the streets of Beijing were already brightly lit. Through the interview with this American progressive writer, we have a deeper understanding of the deep friendship of ordinary Americans towards the Chinese people. (Attached picture)

    怀念和祝贺
    ——访问美国进步女作家斯特朗
    新华社记者　于民生　袁木
    满头银发的美国进步女作家安娜·路易斯·斯特朗，从她住室里的座位上站了起来，兴致勃勃地从衣橱中取出了一件灰色绸面的羊皮大衣。斯特朗激动地告诉记者，这件大衣是林彪元帅当她1946年在中国解放区访问的时候送给她的。十多年来，这位中国人民的老朋友一直把这个值得纪念的礼物经心地保存着，并且回到美国以后每年冬天都要穿一次，以纪念她在中国度过的那些有意义的日子。
    七十一岁的斯特朗从1925年到1947年曾经五次访问过中国，写过不少介绍中国革命情况的通讯报道和进步书籍。她说她这次把林彪元帅送她的皮大衣重新带来，是要穿着它在中国过冬。她表示要更多更好地把新中国的情况介绍给美国人民。
    斯特朗在北京饭店一间明亮宽敞的住室中同记者作了一个半小时的亲切交谈，在她的整个谈话中，都充满了对旧日友谊的无限怀念，表达了对新中国巨大建设成就的热情祝贺。
      “作为中国人民的老朋友，十多年来我一直希望着能重来中国。我怀念着那些我曾经访问过的城市和乡村，怀念着旧日的中国老朋友”，斯特朗以兴奋的声调向记者表达她对中国人民的感情说：“而当我今天重新来到思念着的中国时，我又看到了六亿五千万勤劳勇敢的中国人民，看到了他们所创造的举世无双的惊人奇迹。”
    她戴上了眼镜，打开了两本卷宗，仔细地翻阅着这次她来中国后给美国报纸和杂志写的许多关于中国的报道和文章，并且向我们读了其中的一段：
      “毫无疑问，这里在进行着历史上最伟大的复兴。中国建设的速度是如此之惊人，以至每个人所写的东西都显得过时了！”
    斯特朗恐怕我们不能理解她这段报道的意思，特别加以引伸说：“你几乎很难确切地写出正在中国发生的任何一件事情，因为就在你写作的短短时间里，这件事情却又变化得同原来大不一样了。譬如今天你去访问一个人民公社，人们会给你不要钱的馒头吃，而明天你再到这个人民公社时，人们也许就会给你不要钱的衣服穿！”
    “六万万五千万人民，人人愉快，个个聪明，他们都为着一个共同的目标而辛勤地工作着。就连干部们也是白天工作，晚上参加炼钢。我从来也没有看见过这样朝气勃勃充满生命力的人！”她在谈到这里时，脸上的表情是那样的欢乐。
    斯特朗是一位有着丰富写作阅历的人。从1922年以来，在她三十多年的记者和作家生涯中，她除了报道过有关苏联和中国的情况外，也还报道过西班牙的内战、华沙东线战役和波兰的解放，以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的成立等重大历史事件。看来，目前在中国所发生的惊天动地的事情深深地感动了她。在斯特朗的住室中，我们看到摆满了介绍新中国情况的英文书籍和报刊。在她亲手剪贴的许多资料中，上面都仔细地用大头针别着各种分类的标签。在我们环顾她的住室的情景时，她向我们谈到了十三陵水库，谈到了武汉钢铁公司和长江大桥，也谈到了河南省的水利建设。她以赞美的语调说：“这些都是和平建设，中国在大踏步前进！”
    我们请她谈谈美国人民对中国人民的友谊。斯特朗陷入了沉思。这时，我们看到她脸上浮起了一层抑郁的表情。
      “美国当局执行的敌视中国的政策，使人民没有办法正确地了解中国。”斯特朗音调低沉，痛苦在折磨着她。
    一会儿，这位老人又显得活跃起来。她说：“但是，一般美国人对中国人是有着传统友谊的，他们都知道中国人勤劳，能干。”
    斯特朗打开了刚刚收到的来自美国的一封信。这封信里说，美国人民给艾森豪威尔写了许多信，每五封信中就有四封是反对美国政府在台湾问题上的政策的。斯特朗说：“绝大多数美国人都认为台湾是中国的领土，美国没有理由干涉中国的内政。彭德怀部长的几次文告都非常英明，它们对美国人民教育意义很大，因为这些文告讲的很清楚，中国同蒋介石的问题完全是中国的内政问题，它们可以使美国人民更清楚地懂得：杜勒斯干涉中国内政是完全没有理由的。”
    谈到这里，我们不禁想起了十多年以前毛主席在延安接见斯特朗的事情。那时，斯特朗第一个把毛主席关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的著名论断向世界人民作了报道。我们问斯特朗，十多年以后，她重温毛主席当时的那些话时有何感想。
    “当时认为非常正确，经过十多年的事变以后，现在看来更加正确。”
    难忘的记忆又把这位著名的美国进步女作家带回到毛主席接见她的那个历史的日子里，她显得更加活跃起来，她在尽量地回忆着毛主席当年对她谈过的许多精辟论断，并且向我们复述出来：从表面上看，美帝国主义是最凶恶的，实际上它却是最软弱的；美国的高楼虽然高，但是它的基础是动摇的；不是原子弹消灭人类，而是人类最后将消灭原子弹；……斯特朗这时又重复她自己的看法说：“毛主席的一切断语，都不仅是在当时完全正确，而且后来的历史发展都一一证实了他的英明预见。”
    斯特朗虽已年过七十，但仍精神奕奕，十分健谈。特别是对她访问过的中国革命圣地延安，更是记忆犹新。谈起当年在中国认识的一些老朋友时，她更是充满了喜悦，压抑不住内心的激动。斯特朗顺手从沙发前的茶几上拿起一个褪了色的草绿色呢料手提包给我们看，告诉我们那是延安的女同志在抗战胜利后的第二年送给她的。手提包上用白丝线绣着下面的字样：
    给斯特朗夫人
    中国解放区陕甘宁边区第二保育院敬赠
    1946年8月15日
    在斯特朗看来，就是这样的一个小手提包也凝结着中国人民对她这个普通美国人的深厚友谊。正是这样，她才把它细心的保存了十多年的岁月。
    斯特朗还指着她穿的一条棉裤告诉我们：“这也是当年在延安时穿过的棉裤啊！”仔细一看，这条黑色丝质的棉裤，裤面上有许多小洞，露出了点点白棉。即使是这样，她也珍贵地保存着，因为这是一条凝结着友谊的棉裤啊！
    “十多年中间，我一直盼望着再到中国来。现在到了中国以后，真舍不得再离开她了！”斯特朗充满友谊深情地继续说：“最使我高兴的是，当年延安的那种精神，那亲密的同志关系，那永远向上的革命朝气，那革命者同人民血肉相连的关系，不仅至今还保持着，而且更加发扬光大了。”
    “当年在延安的时候，没有想到中国会变化得这样快吧？”友谊的回忆使得我们的交谈更加融洽亲切，我们禁不住这样的问她。
      “当时我就相信中国革命一定会胜利，但是，决没有想到胜利后中国会建设得这样快！”斯特朗以诗一般的语言兴奋地说：“在10月1日天安门前的观礼台上，我看到了极其动人的伟大场面。占世界四分之一的人都是那样的勤劳，他们自己掌握了自己的命运。我又一次觉得人类的安全与和平有了保障了！”
    斯特朗又笑着对我们说，“十一”晚上在天安门城楼上看焰火的时候，她会见了毛主席和刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、陆定一等同志。斯特朗说：“当我在顷刻之间就见到了毛主席和当年在延安的许多老朋友时，真是无法表达自己感情上的冲动。”
    最后，记者问到她“这次来中国还计划写些什么东西？”斯特朗想了一下说：“我不准备写整个新中国，因为中国发展太快，书还没有出版，事情就又发展了。我很想写一个县的人民公社发展的经过，因为人民公社是最能代表中国的伟大未来的新生细胞。这样做，也许我能够更好地反映出中国的面貌！”
    当我们告辞的时候，北京街头已经是灯火通明。通过对这位美国进步女作家的访问，我们更深刻地了解了普通美国人对中国人民的深厚友谊。（附图片）
