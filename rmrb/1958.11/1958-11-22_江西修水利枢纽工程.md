Jiangxi Builds Water Conservancy Hub Projects

    In Jiangxi Province, 2,752 water conservancy projects have been fully launched, with 500,000 water conservancy workers fighting day and night on the construction sites. The slogan put forward by the people of the province is: "Work hard this winter and spring to basically eliminate drought and flood disasters, realize water conservancy throughout the province, and ensure a bumper harvest despite drought or flood."

    The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee has decided that this year, while vigorously constructing small-scale projects, the province will focus on constructing 441 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects as water conservancy hubs for the province. These will be connected with hundreds of thousands of small-scale projects through ditches and canals, forming a complete water conservancy system for the province based on small-scale projects, with medium-sized projects as the backbone, and combining large, medium, and small projects. The total project volume will reach 3 billion cubic meters of earth and stone, which is six times the amount of earth and stone used in water conservancy construction during the great leap forward last winter and this spring. Upon completion of these projects, the irrigated area will be expanded and improved by 24 million mu, and the water storage capacity will be increased by 30 billion cubic meters. In addition to the province's existing water conservancy projects, with the province's 42 million mu of cultivated land, each mu of land will have 420 to 700 cubic meters of water, ensuring no drought for 100 days without rain and no disaster from rainfall of 300 to 500 millimeters, basically eliminating drought and flood disasters and ensuring a bumper harvest despite drought or flood. At the same time, the province will also build 1,800 small hydropower stations with a total power generation capacity of 55,000 kilowatts. (Attached photo)

    江西修水利枢纽工程
    江西全省已有二千七百五十二座水利工程全面动工，五十万水利大军日夜奋战在工地上。全省人民提出的口号是：“大干一个冬春，基本消灭旱涝灾害，实现全省水利化，旱涝保丰收。”
    江西省委确定今年在大力兴修小型工程的基础上，全省有重点地兴修四百四十一座大中型水利工程，作为全省水利枢纽，并通过沟渠把它同几十万个小型工程联贯起来，使全省形成一个小型为基础、以中型为骨干，大、中、小相结合的完整的水利系统。总的工程量达到三十亿土石方，等于去冬今春大跃进高潮中全省水利建设的土石方的六倍。这些工程完成后，扩大和改善灌溉面积达二千四百万亩，增加蓄水量三百亿公方。加上全省现有水利工程，全省以四千二百万亩耕地面积计算，每亩田就可以有水四百二十到七百公方，保证一百天不下雨不受旱，一次降雨三百到五百公厘不成灾，基本上消灭旱涝灾害，实现旱涝保丰收。同时，全省还将修建总共可发电五万五千瓩的小型水力发电站一千八百座。（附图片）
