Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 15th: Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda expressed his attitude on November 14th regarding the issue of military dictatorship, which has already attracted attention. He said that Indonesia can avoid the very dangerous events that have occurred in some of its neighboring countries.

He said this is because there is a great understanding between the Indonesian armed forces and the government. Therefore, Indonesia has long been able to move in the direction of restoration to normalcy and greater clarity.

Prime Minister Djuanda refuted the absurd statement made by American journalist John Scott. Scott said that “in the underdeveloped countries of Asia,” the path of military dictatorship must be taken before “perfect democracy” can be achieved. Djuanda said that he doubted Scott's statement. He said that Indonesia will not take this path, because the Indonesian armed forces and the government spare no effort to achieve mutual understanding and trust between themselves.

Prime Minister Djuanda also said that the recent events in Indonesia can fully remind the army and the government that they should do their best to avoid the dangerous events that have occurred in some of Indonesia's neighboring countries. He said, however, that there are still signs of "moving in this direction."

Djuanda said, "We have not yet gotten rid of the activities of groups of adventurers and certain groups that only pay attention to their own interests. We must remain vigilant, and we must still boldly take resolute action." He said that there is sufficient strength to prevent such dangerous events.

When talking about the speech given by Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution at the National Military Academy on the 11th, Djuanda said that the government cannot lightly reject the ideas existing in the army—such as soldiers and military leaders participating in decisions regarding the leadership of the country in a personal capacity. He said that in order to solve this problem, good and objective methods must be sought. Therefore, when deciding a person's position, the influence of political parties or groups will be avoided.

Djuanda made the above remarks at a ceremony held at Army Headquarters, where military authorities handed over the Dutch enterprises taken over to the government.

    朱安达总理说
    印度尼西亚不要军事独裁
    认为必须对冒险家集团保持警惕
    新华社雅加达15日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达14日就已经引起大家注意的军事独裁问题表示态度。他说，印度尼西亚可以避免像它的一些邻国所发生的那种非常危险的事件。
    他说，这是由于印度尼西亚武装部队和政府之间彼此非常谅解，因此，印度尼西亚早已能够朝着恢复正常的和更加明确的方向前进。
    朱安达总理驳斥了美国记者约翰·斯科特的荒谬的说法。斯科特说，“在亚洲的不发达国家里”，必须走军事独裁的道路，然后才能达到“完善的民主”。朱安达说，他对斯科特的说法表示怀疑。他说，印度尼西亚不会走这样的道路，因为印度尼西亚的武装部队和政府不遗余力地使彼此之间相互谅解和信任。
    朱安达总理又说，最近在印度尼西亚发生的事件，可以充分地提醒陆军和政府，它们应该尽它们最大力量，来避免像印度尼西亚的一些邻国所发生的那种危险的事件。他说，但是，仍然存在着“朝这个方向走”的迹象。
    朱安达说，“我们还没有摆脱冒险家集团和某些只注意自身利益的集团的活动。我们必须保持警惕，我们仍然必须大胆地采取坚决的行动。”他说，有足够的力量可以防止这种危险的事件。
    朱安达在谈到印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安11日在全国军事学院发表的演说时说，政府不能轻率地拒绝在陆军中所存在的思想——例如士兵和军事领袖以个人资格参加决定国家的领导。他说，为了解决这个问题，必须寻求良好的和客观的方法。因此在决定一个人的职位时，将避免政党或者集团的影响。
    朱安达是在陆军总部举行的由军事当局把接管的荷兰企业移交给政府的仪式上发表上述谈话的。
