    The Nobel Peace Prize Should Be Awarded to Dulles
    Poem by Chi Beiou, Illustration by Ying Tao
    —It has been reported that Dulles has been nominated as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize and has a good chance of winning. It is indeed fitting to award the Nobel Prize to Dulles. Nobel was the inventor of high explosives, and Dulles is full of explosives himself. Who would say it's inappropriate to award the Nobel Prize to Dulles? Since the Literature Prize has been given to a master of defamation, the Peace Prize should naturally be awarded to a war peddler. It makes perfect sense to award the Nobel Prize to Dulles. He engages in aggression and advocates for war everywhere, making people of all countries see the crisis of peace. The Nobel Prize should be awarded to Dulles, and it is entirely appropriate. He has mobilized millions of people to oppose aggression, making him the number one negative teacher for the people of all countries. (Attached picture)

    诺贝尔和平奖金应发给杜勒斯
    池北偶诗　英韬画
    ——有消息说，杜勒斯被提名为诺贝尔和平奖金的候选人，而且颇有希望当选云云。诺贝尔奖金发给杜勒斯，的确合适。诺贝尔是烈性火药的发明人，杜勒斯浑身火药气。诺贝尔奖金发给杜勒斯，谁曰不宜？文学奖金既然给了诽谤能手，和平奖金自当赏予战争贩子。诺贝尔奖金发给杜勒斯，满有道理。他到处搞侵略、鼓吹战争，使各国人民看到了和平的危机。诺贝尔奖金发给杜勒斯，理当如此。他动员了千百万人起来反对侵略，是各国人民天字第一号反面教师。（附图片）
