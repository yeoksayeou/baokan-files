    The Yellow River is Cut Off
    By Our Correspondent Jun Qian
    On the morning of the 25th, the closure of the diversion channel at Shenmen Island in Sanmenxia was completed. Thus, the entire diversion project at Sanmenxia on the Yellow River is basically finished.
    According to the design, the Sanmenxia diversion project was to be carried out when the river flow rate dropped to 1,000 cubic meters per second and was to be completed by December 8th. However, this year, the Yellow River experienced a high-water year, and November saw the highest water month in fifty years, with the maximum flow rate reaching 2,430 cubic meters per second. When the diversion channel at Shenmen River was closed, the flow rate was still above 1,600 cubic meters per second. Even with such a high flow rate, the diversion project only took seven days, twenty-one hours, and forty-five minutes, significantly shorter than the designed time. Such a high speed is rare in world water conservancy projects, which shows that China's water conservancy construction technology has leaped to the world's advanced level.
    The early completion of the diversion project laid a victorious foundation for the future excavation of the dam foundation on the right bank and the pouring of the dam, providing favorable conditions for flood control one year ahead of schedule, power generation six months ahead of schedule, and solving the threat of extraordinary floods to the downstream areas in advance. If the diversion project could not be completed in November, or if it was delayed due to high river water, the ice jam season in December would prevent the diversion from taking place, and the excavation of the foundation would be out of the question, let alone the pouring of the dam. In that case, the entire project would be delayed by one year, and the losses would be difficult to estimate.
    Why did the project progress so quickly? Putting politics in command is an extremely important guarantee. All employees are proud to participate in the construction of this great project to fundamentally control and develop the Yellow River. All the work of each unit is serving the diversion project, and everyone is working with soaring enthusiasm and high spirits. The Party and government leaders of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau and Sanmenxia City are also directing operations day and night on the construction front line, discovering and solving problems in a timely manner, so that the project can move forward safely and smoothly. During the days of the diversion, about 4.5 cubic meters of stones were poured into the raging current every minute or so by a truck, and each shift overfulfilled its task. The design stipulated that 4,000 cubic meters of stones should be thrown each day, but the average daily amount was more than 6,000 cubic meters.
    Thorough organizational preparation played a decisive role. The Sanmenxia project established a special agency in June to study the diversion project plan; in October, it conducted organizational and propaganda education work on the diversion project for employees. Relevant units selected workers with good political conditions and strong physiques to participate in the diversion, trained truck drivers to transport diversion materials, especially drivers of trucks carrying 25 tons, inspected machinery several times, fully prepared materials, and repaired transportation routes. In November, the Party and government leaders of the Engineering Bureau and Sanmenxia City formed the Diversion Project Headquarters. Various tasks were rehearsed, practicing how to hoist large stones conveniently and how to throw 15-ton concrete blocks. During the diversion project model test, it was discovered that there were serious collapses during the advance, and personal or mechanical accidents would occur during the actual advance. Xie Hui, Deputy Director of the Engineering Bureau, invented the "safety row" equipment to be laid on the advancing embankment, so that three trucks could simultaneously pour stones into the river on it, which was both convenient and safe, and played a huge role in improving work efficiency and accelerating the advance. After the project started, more than 30 trucks, one after another, day and night, continuously and orderly dumped stones into the river without any accidents. It was truly a case of skilled soldiers and brave generals, sophisticated weapons, strict organization, and rapid action. After all the preparation work was completed, the diversion project exercise was conducted on November 17th with a cautious attitude, to feel the temperament of the Yellow River water, expose problems, and learn from experience.
    None of the construction workers were at a loss in the face of the ferocious Yellow River water, and no one was bound by the design clauses. Taking the diversion method as an example, foreign countries use the flat blocking method of throwing stones on the entire diversion section, but China has the vertical blocking advance method that has been effective on the Yellow River for thousands of years. Therefore, the flat blocking method was decisively rejected, and the vertical blocking advance method was adopted. On the day of the diversion project exercise, although the river flow rate was 2,030 cubic meters per second, more than double the designed flow rate, the builders did not wait for the river water to drop, but actively overcame this difficulty without delaying the progress of the entire project.
    Although the organizational preparation work and equipment for the diversion project had many superior conditions, the Yellow River water is, after all, a very ferocious enemy, and we must not underestimate it. In addition to widely soliciting reasonable suggestions from employees internally, the headquarters also invited six flood control engineering team leaders from the lower reaches of the Yellow River. These six team leaders all had decades of rich experience in flood control and had blocked dozens or even hundreds of Yellow River breaches. They took turns observing changes in the water situation and the changes in the stones thrown down during the advance, and used poles to probe the scouring of the embankment by the river water, reporting the situation to the headquarters in a timely manner, which greatly helped the command in combat. Finally, it should be mentioned that the selfless help of Soviet experts played a huge role. Soviet experts not only were responsible for the design of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub, but also helped the construction with the great spirit of internationalism during the construction. Korolev, Chief Engineer of the Sanmenxia Project Design of the Leningrad Design Branch of the Soviet Union, and Agarakov, Director of the Construction Department, often went to the construction site to observe and guide, and strongly supported the smooth progress of the diversion project.

    黄河截断了
    本报记者　君谦
    25日清晨，三门峡神门岛上泄水道截流工程合龙了，至此，黄河三门峡的整个截流工程基本结束。
    按照设计，三门峡截流工程要在河水流量降落到一千秒公方时进行，要到12月8日结束。但是今年遇到了黄河丰水年，11月又遇到了五十年来的最大丰水月，最大流量曾达到二千四百三十秒公方，在神门河泄水道截流合龙的时候，流量仍然在一千六百秒公方以上。即使流量这样大，但是截流工程只费时七天又二十一小时四十五分，比设计时间大大缩短。这样高的速度在世界水利工程中是少有的，这说明我国水利工程建设技术已跃到世界先进水平。
    截流工程的提前完成，为今后右岸开挖大坝基坑和浇筑大坝奠定了胜利基础，为提前一年拦洪，提前半年发电，提前解决特大洪水对于下游的威胁，提供了有利条件。如果11月份截流工程不能完成，或因为河水大而推迟截流工程，12月凌汛开始，就不能进行截流，当然也不能开挖基坑，更谈不到浇筑大坝。那样，整个工程要推迟一年，损失将是很难估算的。
    工程为什么进展得这样迅速？政治挂帅是极重要的保证。全体职工人人以能参加这项根治和开发黄河的伟大工程的建设为荣。各单位的一切工作，都为截流工程服务，人人干劲冲天，精神抖擞。三门峡工程局和三门峡市的党政领导同志，也都日夜在施工前线指挥，发现问题及时解决，使工程安全顺利地向前猛进。在截流的日子里，每一分钟左右就有一辆汽车把约四点五公方的石头倾泻到狂流中，每班都超额完成任务。设计规定每天投石四千公方，结果平均每天投石六千多公方。
    严密的组织准备工作，起了决定性的作用。三门峡工程在6月份就成立了专门机构，研究截流工程方案；10月对职工进行关于截流工程的组织和宣传教育工作。有关的单位选拔了政治条件好、身体强健的工人参加截流，训练了运输截流物料的汽车司机，特别训练了驾驶载重二十五吨汽车的司机，几次检修了机械，充分准备了物料，修治了运输线路。进入11月，由工程局和三门峡市的党政领导同志组成了截流工程指挥部。各项工作作了预演，演习大块石如何吊装方便，演习抛投十五吨重的混凝土块。在截流工程模型试验中，发现了在进占的时候有严重的坍塌现象，实际进占的时候将会出现人身事故或机械事故。工程局副局长谢辉发明了在进占的戗堤上铺“安全排”的设备，这样，三辆汽车可以同时在上面往河里倾倒石头，既方便又安全，对于提高工效加速进占起了巨大的作用。工程开始后，三十多辆汽车，一辆接一辆，日夜不息有条不紊地轮番往河里倾倒石头，没有发生什么事故。真是兵精将勇，武器精良，组织严密，行动迅速。当一切准备工作做好了以后就以谨慎的态度，在11月17日进行了截流工程的演习，从演习中摸一摸黄河水的脾气，暴露问题，吸取经验。
    建设工人们没有一个人在凶暴的黄水面前束手束脚，没有人被设计条文束缚住。拿截流方法来说，外国都是用在整个截流断面上全面抛石的平堵方法，但是我国有几千年来在黄河上行之有效的立堵式的进占方法，于是断然否定了平堵方法，采用了立堵式的进占方法。截流工程演习的那天，虽然河水流量是两千零三十秒公方，超过设计流量一倍多，但是建设者们没有等待河水的降落，而是积极地战胜这个困难，没有耽误整个工程的进度。
    截流工程的组织准备工作和设备，虽然具有很多优越条件，但是黄河水毕竟是很凶恶的敌人，不能轻敌。指挥部除了在内部广泛地吸取职工的合理化建议外，又从黄河下游请来六位防洪工程队长，这六位队长都有几十年的防洪丰富经验，都堵过几十个以至于百多个黄河决口。他们日夜轮班在现场观察水势的变化，观察进占抛下石头的变化，用杆子试探河水对于戗堤淘刷的情况，及时将情况报告给指挥部，给指挥作战以很大的帮助。最后，应当谈到：苏联专家的无私的帮助起了很大的作用。苏联专家不但负责作了三门峡水利枢纽的设计工作，在施工中，又以伟大的国际主义精神来帮助施工。苏联列宁格勒设计分院三门峡工程设计总工程师柯洛略夫、施工处长阿加拉科夫等，都经常到工地观察指导，有力地支援了截流工程的顺利进行。
