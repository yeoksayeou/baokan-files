Completing Water Conservancy Construction Tasks Quickly, Efficiently, and Economically
Jiangsu Uses Rope-Pulled Rail Trains to Transport Soil
Xuzhou and Other Areas Mass-Produce Transport Tools to Increase Work Efficiency

(Our report) Jiangsu Province is not only using rope-pulling machines for deep plowing, but is also greatly expanding the role of rope-pulling machines in water conservancy projects. According to incomplete statistics from Yangzhou and Xuzhou special districts alone, there are now about 10,000 rope-pulling machines投入in water conservancy projects.

Currently, in counties and cities in northern Jiangsu where the autumn harvest and planting ended earlier, river network projects have begun one after another. Because the steel and agriculture fronts are very busy with production, and labor allocation is tight, all localities have grasped the experience of "tool reform preceding water conservancy construction" and mobilized the masses to vigorously carry out tool reform. Taixing, Suining, Taicang and other counties have successfully tested the use of rope-pulling machines to pull rail trains to transport soil at pilot construction sites, which has pointed the way for the推广widespread use of rope-pulling machines in water conservancy projects.

The rope-pulled rail train is composed of a rope-pulling machine, rails, and a four-wheeled flatcar. When working, the loaded car is pulled to the top of the堤the bank to unload the soil, and the empty car is pulled back to the loading area, just like a train running on a railway.

Transporting soil is a heavy task in embankment projects. In the past, people pushed small dirt carts, which was laborious, inefficient, and transported little soil. Now, using rope-pulled rail trains to transport soil generally increases work efficiency by more than five times; mechanically powered rope-pulled rail trains increase work efficiency by dozens of times. The mechanically powered rope-pulled rail train created by the masses in Taixing County can travel from the loading area to the unloading area, more than 200 meters away, in six or seven minutes, carrying seven or eight four-wheeled flatcars each time, with a daily soil transporting efficiency of 700 to 1,000 cubic meters. The manpower used is also relatively small. Including the driver, digging, and unloading workers, only 16 people are needed, and each person's average daily efficiency is as high as about 50 cubic meters. The人力manual rope-pulled rail train in Qiao宁 County requires six people to push the winch and dig, load, and unload. At a distance of 100 meters, the average daily efficiency per person is about 20 cubic meters.

In addition to pulling wheeled vehicles to transport soil, rope-pulling machines can also be used to dig soil. When working, it is like deep plowing the land, and the work efficiency is generally five times higher than manual digging.

Recently, at the Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy On-site Conference held in Taixing County, the Provincial Department of Water Conservancy called on all large, medium, and small water conservancy projects in the province to quickly promote the use of rope-pulled rail trains to complete the water conservancy tasks of this winter and next spring quickly, efficiently, and economically.

According to Xinhua Daily News, in the water conservancy tool reform movement throughout Jiangsu Province, all localities have adopted the method of focusing on key points and全面开花 allowing water conservancy tools to "bloom in a hundred flowers." After Xuzhou Special District reformed 950,000 water conservancy tools, basically achieving车子化vehicle-ization,轴承化bearing-ization, and轨道化rail-ization, it focused on producing 100,000 rope-pulling machines, striving to achieve the绞关化winch-ization of soil transportation. Since Changshu County launched the tool reform movement led by winches and four-wheeled flatcars, the county has newly manufactured more than 13,000 winches, 30,000 four-wheeled flatcars, more than 138,000 meters of rails, 20,000 shovels, and various soil transportation tools, while also repairing existing water conservancy tools.

In order to complete the water conservancy tool reform quickly, efficiently, and economically, all localities have also fully mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and implemented the方針guideline of "reforming the old to create the new" and "using local methods instead of洋methods." During the reform of water conservancy tools in Nantong Special District, more than 500 tons of steel were needed, and the masses actively contributed iron and materials, reaching more than 400 tons. The people of Xuyi County contributed wood, iron, and stone materials, and in less than a week, all the wood and iron materials needed for the county's planned vehicle manufacturing were solved. Many communes in Changshu County tried every means to find substitutes,改造改装refitting the槽筒木 trough wood of old waterwheels into wooden rails; old floorboards were改做made into car boards, and many seemingly useless wood and iron materials were converted into good tools through careful改造modification. Chen Binglou, a carpenter at the Huinan Farm Tool Factory in Nanhui County, and others, in order to save steel raw materials, studied the modification of iron shafts into wooden shafts and iron wheels into wooden wheels, and created a "nail-free four-wheeled flatcar." The county saved 13.5 tons of iron nails by manufacturing 30,000 four-wheeled flatcars.

The more than 4.5 million newly manufactured water conservancy tools have begun to show their great power in the current water conservancy projects. The foot-operated soil transportation winch manufactured by the Zhongxing Commune in Jiangyin County can transport soil at an efficiency of 50 cubic meters per person per day, which is more than ten times higher than manual carrying; the water conservancy construction site of Xingnan Commune in Xinghua County dispatched more than 2,000 vehicles and more than 200 winches, basically realizing the vehicle-ization and winch-ization of soil transportation, greatly improving work efficiency. More than 1,000 people have an average daily work efficiency of 68 cubic meters. On the Grand Canal construction site in Pei County, there were more than 20,000 vehicles for more than 30,000 migrant workers, with an average of two vehicles for every three people. Currently, the average work efficiency of 34 platoons has reached 20 cubic meters, and the highest has reached 40 cubic meters. The masses reflect that: with the "fourizations" on the construction site, no matter how big the task is, they are not afraid.

    多快好省地完成水利建设任务
    江苏用绳索牵引轨道列车运土
    徐州等地大量制造运输工具提高工效
    本报讯　江苏省在使用绳索牵引机深耕的同时，又在水利工程上大大发挥了绳索牵引机的作用。仅据扬州、徐州几个专区的不完全统计，现在投入水利工程的绳索牵引机已有一万部左右。
    目前，在江苏北部秋收秋种结束较早的县市，河网化工程已经陆续动工。由于钢铁、农业战线生产十分繁忙，劳力调配紧张，各地都抓住了“水利尚未动工，工具改革先行”的经验，发动群众大搞工具改革。泰兴、睢宁、太仓等县在试点工地上，用绳索牵引机牵引轨道列车运土试验成功，就为在水利工程中推广使用绳索牵引机指出了道路。
    绳索牵引轨道列车，是由绳索牵引机、轨道和四轮平车三部分组成的。工作时，实车拉向堤顶卸土区，空车拉回装土区，就像火车在铁道上运行一样。
    运土，是河堤工程中一件重活，过去是人推小土车，费力大，运土少，工效低。现在用绳索牵引轨道列车运土，工效一般提高五倍以上；机力绳索牵引轨道列车，工效提高几十倍。泰兴县群众创造的机力绳索牵引轨道列车，从装土区到卸土区二百多公尺，六、七分钟就可来回一次，每次挂四轮平车七、八辆，每天运土工效七百方到一千方。所用人力也比较少，包括司机、挖土、卸土工在内，只要十六人，每人每天平均工效高达五十方左右。瞧宁县的人力绳索牵引轨道列车，推绞关和挖装卸共六人，在距离一百公尺的情况下，每天每人平均工效在二十方左右。
    绳索牵引机除能牵引车轮运土外，还可用来挖土。工作时，像深翻土地一样，比人挖工效一般提高到五倍。
    最近，在泰兴县召开的江苏省水利现场会议上，省水利厅号召全省大中小型水利工程，迅速推广使用绳索牵引轨道列车，多快好省地完成今冬明春的水利任务。
                      （严锋明）
    据新华日报消息　江苏全省在水利工具改革运动中，各地都采取抓住重点、四面开花的办法，使水利工具百花齐放。徐州专区在改革九十五万件水利工具、基本达到车子化、轴承化、轨道化后，又重点赶制绳索牵引机十万部，争取实现运土绞关化。常熟县自开展以绞关四平车带头的工具改革运动以来，全县已新制绞关一万三千多部、四平车三万辆、轨道十三万八千多公尺、铁锹二万把和各式运土工具，同时还整修了旧有的水利工具。
    为了多快好省地完成水利工具改革，各地还充分发动群众、依靠群众，贯彻了以旧改新、以土代洋方针，改革治水工具。南通专区在改革水利工具中需要五百多吨钢铁，群众积极献铁献料就达到四百多吨。盱眙县人民献木料、献铁料、献石料，不到一个星期，就使全县计划制造车子所需要的木料、铁料全部得到解决。常熟县许多公社千方百计寻找代用品，把旧水车的槽筒木改装成木轨道；旧地板改做成车子板，许多看来没有用的木料、铁料，经过精心改造，都变成了好工具。南汇县惠南农具厂的木工陈丙楼等，为了节省钢铁原料，研究将铁轴改木轴，将铁轮改木轮，并创造了“无钉四平车”，全县造三万辆四平车，就节省了铁钉子十三吨半。
    各地新制造的四百五十多万件水利工具，已开始在当前水利工程中大显威力。江阴县中兴公社制造的脚踏运土绞关机，每人每天运土工效达五十方，比人工挑抬高十多倍；兴化县兴南公社水利工地出动了二千多辆车子，二百多部绞关，基本实现了运土车子化、绞关化，大大提高了工效，有一千多人平均每人每天工效达六十八方。沛县大运河工地三万多民工就有二万多辆车子，平均三人就有二辆，现在，有三十四个排平均工效已达二十方，最高的达四十方。群众反映说：工地有了“四个化”，任务再大也不怕。
