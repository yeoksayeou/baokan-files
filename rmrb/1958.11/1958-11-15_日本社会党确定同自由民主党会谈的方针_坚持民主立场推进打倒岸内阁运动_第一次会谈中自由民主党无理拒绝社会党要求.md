Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: The Japan Socialist Party, at a meeting of its chairman and bureau directors held in Tokyo today, decided to hold talks with the Liberal Democratic Party on issues related to the political crisis in Japan caused by the Kishi Nobusuke group's use of illegal means to extend the Diet session.

The policy for handling these talks between the two parties, adopted at the meeting, stipulates that the movement to crush the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" should be further promoted, developing it into a movement to defend democracy, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, and dissolve the Diet; even if agreeing to hold talks between the two parties, efforts should still be made to implement the three principles of repealing the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill," invalidating the extension of the Diet session, and demanding the resignation of the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives.

The policy stipulates that the Socialist Party must consistently adhere to a democratic stance; it must pay close attention to public opinion with a humble attitude, and move forward without detaching itself from the masses.

The Central Executive Committee meeting of the Socialist Party, held subsequently, agreed to the policy of holding talks between the two parties. The meeting also decided that Socialist Party Secretary-General Inajiro Asanuma would hold a preliminary consultation with Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Shojiro Kawashima on the 14th regarding the issue of holding leaders' talks between the two parties. In the preliminary talks, the Socialist Party would put forward the three principles of demanding the declaration of the extension of the Diet session as invalid, etc. If the Liberal Democratic Party lacked sincerity, the Socialist Party would terminate the talks at any time.

The Kishi Nobusuke group has been begging to hold talks between the two parties, attempting to divert the Japanese people's struggle against its "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" through the talks, and to alleviate the Japanese people's anger at its illegal extension of the Diet session. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government has not abandoned its conspiracy to revive the police state. This was illustrated by Kishi Nobusuke's speech today at the Central Training Course for Organizational Leaders held by the Liberal Democratic Party's National Organization Committee in Tokyo.

Kishi Nobusuke said: "The Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill is definitely necessary, and I want to get it passed." He said: "As for whether the Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill can be passed in this Diet session, this should be decided after very careful discussion. At this time, we should avoid relying on a majority of seats to force it through." He continued: "However, doing so does not mean withdrawing the bill or abandoning the bill." A resolution passed by the Liberal Democratic Party's Special Committee on "Security Countermeasures" on the afternoon of the 12th also showed that the Kishi Nobusuke group insists on restoring Japan to a police state. This resolution believes that: "Judging from the current international situation and the movements of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, it is necessary to do a good job in security work, and in connection with this issue, in order to safeguard parliamentary politics, the (Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill) should be passed in the Diet session."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The Japan Socialist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party held their first meeting in Tokyo this morning to address the current chaotic political situation in Japan. This political crisis was created single-handedly by the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which used illegal means to extend the session of the extraordinary Diet session, attempting to forcibly pass the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill." The Liberal Democratic Party attempted to induce the Socialist Party to compromise through the talks.

In today's meeting, the Socialist Party resolutely demanded that the resolution to extend the Diet session be declared invalid, that the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" be scrapped, and that the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives resign. However, the Liberal Democratic Party unreasonably rejected the demands put forward by the Socialist Party, so the talks yielded no results. The Socialist Party was represented in the talks by Secretary-General Inajiro Asanuma and Diet Countermeasures Committee Chairman Mitsu Kono. The Liberal Democratic Party was represented by Secretary-General Shojiro Kawashima and Diet Countermeasures Committee Chairman Isamu Murakami.

The Socialist Party also held a meeting of its chairman and bureau directors in Tokyo this afternoon to discuss countermeasures for the current talks between the two parties. The meeting decided that, apart from the current four-person talks, no private consultations would be conducted at all.

Talks between the two parties will continue on the 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held a national discussion conference in Kanagawa Prefecture on the 13th, deciding to carry out a strength struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" on November 26th as planned.

The conference decided that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan would consistently adhere to the three principles of invalidating the Kishi Nobusuke government's illegal extension of the Diet session, demanding that the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" be scrapped, and demanding the resignation of the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives.

The conference discussed the methods for conducting the struggle in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The Fukuoka Teachers' Union of Japan held a representative meeting on the 13th, deciding to hold a strike by stopping classes on the afternoon of November 26th to participate in the national joint struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," which the Japan Teachers' Union is scheduled to hold on that day.

The executive body of the Fukuoka Teachers' Union also put forward a future struggle plan against the "Performance Evaluation" system, deciding to conduct a strike by all teachers stopping classes and holding an indefinite refusal to work shifts. This struggle plan will be submitted to the Japan Teachers' Union's extraordinary conference scheduled to be held in Kyoto on November 20th for final decision.

    日本社会党确定同自由民主党会谈的方针
    坚持民主立场推进打倒岸内阁运动
    第一次会谈中自由民主党无理拒绝社会党要求
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天在东京举行的委员长和局长会议，决定同自由民主党就由岸信介集团使用非法手段延长国会会期所造成的日本政治危机的有关问题举行会谈。
    会议通过的处理这次两党会谈的方针规定，要进一步推进粉碎“警察官职务执行法修正案”的运动，使它发展成为保卫民主、打倒岸信介内阁和解散国会的运动；即使同意了举行两党会谈，仍然要努力贯彻把“警察官职务执行法修正案”作废、延长国会会期的决议无效和要求众议院正副议长辞职等三项原则。
    方针规定，社会党要始终坚持民主的立场；要以谦虚的态度注视舆论的动向，在不脱离群众的情况下前进。
    社会党随后举行的中央执行委员会会议，同意了举行两党会谈的方针。会议还决定，社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎14日将同自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎就举行两党领袖会谈问题进行预备性的商谈。在预备会谈中，社会党要提出要求宣布延长国会会期无效等三项原则。如果自由民主党没有诚意，社会党将随时终止会谈。
    岸信介集团一直在央求举行两党会谈，企图通过会谈来转移日本人民反对它的“警察官职务执行法修正案”的斗争目标，缓和日本人民对它非法延长国会会期的愤怒情绪。但是，岸信介政府并未放弃它复活警察国家的阴谋。岸信介今天在自由民主党全国组织委员会在东京举办的组织领导者中央进修会上的讲话说明了这一点。
    岸信介说：“警察官职务执行法修正案是一定需要的，而且我想要使它获得通过。”他说：“至于在这次国会会议中能否使警察官职务执行法修正案获得通过，这应该在十分慎重地讨论以后才能决定。在这个时候，应该避免依靠多数议席来硬干。”他接着说：“但是，这样做并不意味着撤回这个法案或者放弃这个法案。”自由民主党“治安对策”特别委员会12日下午通过的一个决议，也说明岸信介集团坚持要把日本恢复为一个警察国家，这个决议认为：“从目前的国际形势和日本工会总评议会，全日本学生自治会总联合会的动向看来，有必要做好治安工作，同这个问题联系起来，为了维护议会政治，应该在国会会议上通过（警察官职务执行法修正案）。”
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本社会党和自由民主党今天上午在东京就收拾目前日本混乱政局的问题举行了第一次会谈。这次政治危机是由岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党所一手造成的，它们使用非法手段延长国会临时会议的会期，企图强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”。自由民主党企图通过会谈诱骗社会党妥协。
    在今天的会谈中，社会党方面坚决要求宣布延长国会会期的决议无效、要求将“警察官职务执行法修正案”作废和众议院正副议长辞职。但是，自由民主党方面无理拒绝了社会党所提出的要求，因此会谈没有结果。社会党方面参加会谈的有书记长浅沼稻次郎、国会对策委员会委员长河野密，自由民主党方面是干事长川岛正次郎、国会对策委员会委员长村上勇。
    社会党今天下午还在东京举行了委员长和局长会议，讨论了目前进行的两党会谈的对策问题。会议决定，除了目前进行的四人会谈以外，完全不进行私人的商谈。
    两党之间的会谈将在15日继续进行。
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会13日在神奈川县召开了全国讨论大会，决定按照预定计划，在11月26日进行反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的实力斗争。
    大会决定，日本工会总评议会将始终坚持岸信介政府非法延长国会会期的决议无效、要求把“警察官职务执行法修正案”作为废案、要求众议院正副议长辞职等三项原则。
    大会讨论了今后进行斗争的方法。
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本福冈教职员工会13日举行了代表会议，决定在11月26日下午举行停止上课的斗争，来参加日本教职员工会预定在那天举行的反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的全国联合斗争。
    福冈教职员工会执行机构还提出了今后反对“勤务评定”制度的斗争方案，决定以全体教员停止上课和举行不定期限的拒绝值班的斗争。这个斗争方案将提交预定11月20日在京都举行的日本教职员工会临时大会作最后决定。
