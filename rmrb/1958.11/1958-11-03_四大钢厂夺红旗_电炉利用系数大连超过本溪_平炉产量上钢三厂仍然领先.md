Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 2nd: The open hearth furnace workshops of Shanghai's two major steel plants created miracles in October in the competition to win the high-yield steelmaking Red Banner. The Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant's open hearth furnace workshop, which has maintained the high-yield open hearth furnace Red Banner for more than two consecutive years, achieved an open hearth utilization coefficient of 17.046 in October, breaking their own national record of 14.225 set in August and continuing to lead the country. The Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant's open hearth furnace workshop, which has been closely following and striving to catch up with No. 3 Plant, saw its utilization coefficient jump from 8.463 in September to 15.748 this month, also reaching the national advanced level. Both workshops exceeded the national plan for October.

The competition to win the Red Banner was unusually fierce from the very beginning of October. In the first half of October, the open hearth utilization coefficient of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant once surpassed that of No. 3 Plant, taking the lead. Faced with this situation, the workers of No. 3 Plant's open hearth furnace workshop were both nervous and anxious. They originally "grasped every shift, every furnace," but now they proposed to "grasp every minute, every second, even every ounce." They adopted a series of measures that quickly increased the output of each furnace of steel from more than 30 tons in the past to more than 40 tons, with some reaching 45 tons. The smelting time was also shortened. As a result, the utilization coefficient of this workshop in the second half of the month quickly rose from 14.26 in the first half of the month to 19.66, surpassing Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant. The total steel output of the entire workshop exceeded the 10,000-ton mark for the first time this month, producing 488 tons of steel more than planned.

Under the slogan of "Learn from No. 3 Plant, Catch up with No. 3 Plant, Surpass No. 3 Plant," the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant seized every shift and every furnace's production, not letting go of even a minute or a second. The workshop's leading cadres also changed their work style, moving to the dispatch room next to the open hearth furnace to work, studying production with the workers day and night. As a result, the output of each furnace of steel in this workshop gradually increased from more than 40 tons to 60 tons, 65 tons, and 70 tons in October, with some reaching 76 tons, and the average daily output reached 485 tons, more than double that of September.

Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, November 2nd: The Dalian Steel Plant, which has maintained the national high-yield electric furnace steelmaking Red Banner for three consecutive months, set a record high of 63.17 for the electric furnace utilization coefficient on the 30th, surpassing the national record of 62.5 set by the Benxi Steel Plant on October 21st.

The electric furnace utilization coefficient of the Dalian Steel Plant was 36.97 in September. During the high-yield week from October 15th to 21st, the daily average utilization coefficient rose to 40.2. The record created on the 30th was 22.97 higher than the high-yield week. Compared with the level in September, the output of the electric furnace increased by more than 70%. On this day, the electric furnace utilization coefficient of the "Youth No. 2" furnace of this steel plant reached as high as 77.33, surpassing the national youth furnace record of 74.45 tons created by the "Satellite" youth furnace of the Benxi Steel Plant on October 28th, and taking the lead among the national youth furnaces.

    四大钢厂夺红旗
    电炉利用系数大连超过本溪
    平炉产量上钢三厂仍然领先
    据新华社上海2日电　上海两大钢厂的平炉车间在争夺炼钢高产红旗的竞赛中，10月份同创奇迹。连续两年多保持平炉高产红旗的上钢三厂平炉车间，10月份的平炉利用系数达到十七点零四六，打破了他们在8月份创造的十四点二二五的全国最高纪录，继续在全国领先。紧追猛赶三厂的上钢一厂平炉车间，这个月的利用系数从9月份的八点四六三跳到十五点七四八，也达到了全国先进水平。两个车间都超额完成了10月份的国家计划。
    这场夺红旗的竞赛，在10月份一开始就异常激烈。在10月上半月，上钢一厂的平炉利用系数曾赶过三厂，一路领先。面对着这一情况，三厂平炉车间的工人们又紧张又焦急。他们原来是“班班抓、炉炉抓”，现在又提出“分分抓，秒秒抓，斤两也要抓”。他们采取了一系列的措施，使每炉钢的产量很快就从过去的三十多吨提高到四十吨以上，高的达到四十五吨。冶炼时间也缩短了。这样，这个车间下半月的利用系数很快就从上半月的十四点二六上升到十九点六六，赶过了上钢一厂。全车间钢的产量，在这个月第一次突破了万吨大关，比计划多生产四百八十八吨钢。
    上钢一厂平炉车间在“学三厂，赶三厂，超三厂”的口号下，抓紧每班、每炉的生产，一分一秒的时间都不放过。车间领导干部也改变作风，搬到紧靠平炉的调度室办公，不分日夜地和工人一起研究生产。这样，10月份这个车间每炉钢产量就逐步由四十多吨提高到六十吨、六十五吨、七十吨，高的达到七十六吨，平均日产量达到四百八十五吨，超过9月份的一倍以上。
    新华社旅大2日电　连续三个月保持全国电炉炼钢高产红旗的大连钢厂，30日创电炉利用系数六十三点一七的最高纪录，超过了本溪钢厂10月21日创造的六十二点五的全国纪录。
    大连钢厂9月份电炉利用系数是三十六点九七，在10月15日到21日的高产周里，日平均利用系数上升到四十点二。30日创造的纪录又比高产周高出了二十二点九七，和9月份的水平比较，电炉的产量增加了70％多。这一天，这个钢厂的“青年二号”炉电炉利用系数高达七十七点三三，超过了本溪钢厂“卫星号”青年炉10月28日创造的七十四点四五吨的全国青年炉最高纪录，跃居全国青年炉首位。
