Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 15th: Henan Province has recently achieved tremendous success on the financial and trade front. As of November 12th, Henan Province has overfulfilled its annual tasks in grain purchase, cotton, hemp, scrap steel, scrap copper procurement, bank loan repayment, and savings. According to relevant departments, the procurement plans for flue-cured tobacco and live pigs are also expected to be completed in the next few days through a concentrated effort.

This year, the widespread establishment of people's communes and the decentralization of the financial and trade system, with the masses handling their own inspection, purchase, storage, processing, transportation, settlement, and transfer, have provided favorable conditions for a great leap forward in Henan's financial and trade work. Therefore, at the Party Committee's command, many areas completed a month's, a quarter's, or even a year's worth of financial and trade tasks in a single day. On the grain front alone, more than 12 million people participated in procurement and storage work. In mid-October, only 75 counties and cities in the province had started storing grain, but by November 9th, 86 counties and cities had overfulfilled their grain purchase plans. The total amount of autumn grain (excluding potatoes) purchased and stored in the province reached over 2,386 million catties, exceeding the annual plan by 6%. In cotton procurement, the highest daily procurement volume in the province reached 103 million catties, equivalent to one-third of the total procurement volume for the entire last year. In Xinyang Prefecture, a major pig-producing area, over 410,000 fat pigs were procured in less than two days from October 31st to November 1st, exceeding the total procurement volume for the entire prefecture last year by one-third.

In the process of completing various financial and trade tasks through concentrated efforts, Henan Province first used various facts to criticize all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas. Before the province organized the great leap forward movement in agricultural product procurement, Xinyang Prefecture had already completed its annual procurement plan for agricultural and sideline products, and Shangqiu Prefecture had also completed its grain purchase plan. In late October, the commercial and grain departments of Henan Province held on-the-spot meetings in these two prefectures to exchange experiences, which powerfully criticized the "conditions theory," "wait and see" and other arguments that existed in various places. At the same time, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made comprehensive arrangements for various tasks in the province in November, determining that under the principle of taking steel as the key link to drive everything else, the autumn harvest should be completed from November 1st to 10th, and the procurement of various agricultural products should be completed from November 11th to 15th. The Provincial Party Committee also held successive telephone conferences with local municipal Party Committees to make arrangements. On November 5th, the Provincial Party Committee organized a broadcast meeting on financial and trade work, requiring Party Committees at all levels in the province to appoint a secretary to personally take charge and lead the procurement campaign, and to re-arrange work in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, so as to unify the work pace in all regions of the province. After the meeting, various townships, communes, and brigades mobilized from top to bottom, making full preparations, determining inspectors and custodians, counting warehouses, planning processing and transportation, and preparing various utensils. In many places, the masses also launched extensive airing of views, big debates, and wrote big-character posters, letters of determination, and letters of guarantee, proposing the number of days and specific dates for preparation, concentrated efforts, and finishing touches, as well as precautions, to ensure the completion of the procurement tasks on time, in quantity, and in quality.

According to the instructions given by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to organizations at all levels, to do a good job in agricultural product procurement, it is necessary to pass the "five barriers" of procurement, processing, transportation, storage, and helping people's communes develop diversified economies in one go. At present, areas that have completed the agricultural product procurement tasks have already shifted to processing and transportation work, and are also starting to carry out the procurement of small native products and small oilseeds, as well as the supply of materials. Their slogan is: "No pride, no complacency, seize the opportunity to vigorously attack the next three barriers (processing, transportation, and storage), leap again and again, turn over and over again, and win the championship on the financial and trade front."

    河南完成农产品收购计划
    目前正乘胜猛攻加工、调运和保管三关
    新华社郑州15日电　河南省，最近在财贸战线上获得巨大成就。截至11月12日，河南省粮食征购，棉花、麻类、废钢铁、废铜采购，银行归贷、储蓄等都已超额完成全年任务。据有关部门估计，烤烟、生猪的收购计划也将在最近几天内突击完成。
    今年，人民公社的普遍建立和财贸体制下放，由群众自己来进行验级、收购、保管、加工、运输、结算、转账，给河南省财贸工作大跃进提供了良好的条件。因此，党委一声令下，许多地区在一天内就完成了一个月、一个季度甚至一年的财贸任务。仅粮食战线上，最近就有一千二百多万人参加征购、入库等工作，10月中旬全省还只有七十五个县市开始把粮食入库，到11月9日，就有八十六个县市超额完成粮食征购计划。全省征购入库的秋粮（不包括薯类）共达二十三亿八千六百多万斤，超过全年计划6％。在棉花收购方面，全省最高的日收购量曾达一亿三百万斤，等于去年全年收购量的三分之一。产猪较多的信阳专区，10月31日到11月1日不到两昼夜，便突击收购肥猪四十一万多头，比去年全专区全年收购量还多出三分之一。
    河南省在突击完成各项财贸任务中，首先用各种事实批判了各色各样的右倾保守思想。在全省尚未组织农产品收购工作大跃进运动之前，信阳专区已经完成了全年农副产品采购计划，商丘专区也完成了粮食征购计划，10月下旬，河南省商业、粮食部门分别在这两个专区召开现场会议交流了经验，有力地批判了各地存在的“条件论”、“等一等再说”等论调。同时，中共河南省委把全省在11月份的各项工作任务作了全面安排，确定在以钢为纲带动一切的原则下，11月1日至10日完成秋收，11日至15日完成各项农产品收购任务。省委还向各地市委连续召开电话会议进行布置。省委在11月5日组织了一次有关财贸工作的广播大会，要求全省各级党委确定一位书记亲自挂帅，领导收购运动，并根据省委、省人民委员会指示精神，重新安排工作，使全省各个地区的工作步调统一起来。会后各乡、社、大队自上而下层层动员，充分做好准备工作，确定验级员、保管员，清点仓库，筹划加工、运输，准备各项用具。许多地方群众还开展大鸣大放大辩论，写大字报，决心书，保证书，提出准备、突击、扫尾的天数和具体日期，以及注意事项等，保证按时按量按质完成收购任务。
    根据中共河南省委给各级组织的指示，做好农产品收购工作要一口气过好收购、加工、调运、保管、帮助人民公社发展多种经济等“五关”。目前完成了农产品采购任务的地区，已经转入加工、调运工作，并且着手进行小土产、小油料的收购工作和物资供应工作。他们的口号是：“不骄傲、不自满、乘胜猛攻下三关（加工、调运、保管），跃再跃，翻再翻，财贸战线夺状元”。
