    Deep Internationalist Affection
    The People's Daily published an article by Comrade Wei Wei on November 14th, entitled "Deep Affection of Parting Reluctance" on the eighth page. This article is full of the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, praising the hardworking, brave, and simple nature of the Korean people, and praising the lofty internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers in cherishing every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea. Their scene of reluctance to part seems to appear before our eyes, moving me to tears. After reading this article, my excited mood lingered for a long time. I am determined to learn the noble qualities of the Volunteers and the strong will of the Korean people.

    国际主义的深情
    11月14日人民日报第八版刊载了魏巍同志所写“依依惜别的深情”。这篇文章，字里行间都洋溢着朝中两国人民深厚的友情，歌颂了朝鲜人民勤劳、勇敢、朴实的本色，歌颂了志愿军爱护朝鲜一山一水、一草一木的崇高国际主义精神。他们依依惜别的情景好像显现在我们眼前，使我感动得流下了热泪。看完这篇文章，激动的心情久久不能平静。我下定决心：学习志愿军的高尚品质，学习朝鲜人民的坚强意志。
