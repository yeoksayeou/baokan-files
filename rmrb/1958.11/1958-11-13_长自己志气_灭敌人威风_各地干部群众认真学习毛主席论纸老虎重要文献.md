Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 10th. The broad masses of cadres, workers, and peasants in Hebei Province are extensively studying Chairman Mao's important documents on "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers."

    After Chairman Mao's important documents were published in the People's Daily, Hebei organized cadres and the masses in various regions to study and hold discussions. The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee, led by Prefectural Committee Secretary Fu Xuezhou, gave a mobilization report to cadres and launched a week-long study among cadres throughout the area. Gaocheng County organized 110,000 people for discussions. Luanping County launched a large-scale discussion throughout the county. Rural Red and Expert Schools in the Chengde area all used Chairman Mao's documents as political lesson content, going deep into construction sites and workshops, utilizing rest time, and organizing all cadres and masses to participate in the study. Matou People's Commune in Zhuozhou County had the Party Committee give a report to more than 4,000 steelworkers and more than 8,000 commune members at the Zhangcun iron smelting site. Elementary school students provided supplementary lessons for the elderly and sick, organizing all adults to participate in the study.
    Through study, the broad masses of cadres and people have further strengthened their confidence and revolutionary drive in the struggle against imperialism. Many cited facts such as China's wheat yield surpassing the United States, the American economic crisis, and artificial satellites lagging far behind the Soviet Union, proving that American imperialism is not only a paper tiger militarily, but also economically and technologically. Steelworkers battling day and night at construction sites in various regions, after studying Chairman Mao's documents, expressed their determination to complete the steel production task, strike at American imperialism, and support the liberation of Taiwan.
    Many cadres, after studying this important document, felt the importance of studying Chairman Mao's works. In studying this document, everyone felt particularly profound about the following: First, the importance of recognizing phenomena and essence. Chairman Mao is good at grasping the essence and the mainstream, therefore he can see that although the revolutionary forces are small, "a single spark can start a prairie fire," and although the enemy appears strong on the surface, they will eventually be defeated by the people. Second, Chairman Mao's thesis of strategically despising the enemy while tactically taking the enemy seriously means that, towards imperialism, we must both recognize its paper tiger nature and have full confidence in victory, and treat it as a real tiger in battle. Third, Chairman Mao always emphasizes the role of people, opposing "weaponry only theory" in the war issue, and points out that the key to determining the victory or defeat of a war lies in people, not weapons. "Weaponry only theory" and "conditions only theory" only see things and not people. We must see both things and people in order to do a good job and achieve victory.
    The broad masses of cadres and people, after studying Chairman Mao's documents, have increased their confidence in accelerating socialist construction and actively preparing conditions for a gradual transition to communism. Now, Party committees in various regions of Hebei are organizing cadres and the masses to continue to conduct in-depth study, deeply understanding the great significance of Chairman Mao's articles.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, November 12th. The broad masses of cadres and people in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's documents on "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." The Party Committee of the autonomous region's directly affiliated organs, the Nanning Municipal Committee, and the Liuzhou Municipal Committee, etc., have all issued notices to organize study. The notice from the Liuzhou Municipal Committee believes that this great revolutionary document is a weapon to help us correctly understand the truth that all reactionaries are bound to perish and the revolutionary cause is bound to be victorious. The directly affiliated organs of the autonomous region have held a report meeting, followed by widespread discussions. The Nanning Municipal Committee is training propaganda cadres, preparing to widely organize reports and carry out study and discussion among the masses in the city.
    In recent days, the Guangxi branch of Xinhua Bookstore has distributed more than 60,000 copies of Chairman Mao's book "On Paper Tigers." The number of pre-orders from various regions across the region is constantly increasing, reaching more than 200,000 copies by the 11th.
    This document has become the center of people's daily discussions. Everyone who sees Chairman Mao's brilliant foresight deeply feels the greatness of Chairman Mao's philosophical thought, and their confidence in defeating the enemy is even stronger. When some representatives attending the Guangxi Military Region Party Congress held a forum, Huang Guolan, a veteran soldier of the Right River Eighth Red Army and current deputy commander of the Yulin Military Sub-district, used his revolutionary struggle experience of more than twenty years to explain that every local struggle experience proves Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis. He said: After the Eighth Red Army left the Right River and went north in 1932, Kuomintang reactionaries such as Zhang Fakui continuously used the strength of two armies to sweep through the Right River revolutionary base, attempting to destroy the weak revolutionary forces left behind at the time. However, in these years, the revolutionary forces were not only not eliminated, but grew stronger day by day, until the victory of the struggle.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 12th. Teachers, students, and staff of universities and colleges in the capital have been enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's important document "On Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" in recent days, and have also held discussions and forums. After studying, everyone has further liberated their thinking, armed their minds, and strengthened their confidence in building the cause of communism.
    Teachers, students, and staff from departments such as the Industrial Economics Department, Journalism Department, Philosophy Department, and Law Department of the Renmin University of China widely studied this important document, and even teachers and students sent down to the countryside for labor training took the time to conduct discussions. Chen Shulan, a fourth-year student of the Industrial Economics Department and a national model worker in the textile industry, said: Imperialist countries are constantly experiencing economic crises and are declining, while our country is leaping forward rapidly and prospering. People all over the world support us and oppose imperialism. Although American imperialism still occupies our Taiwan, it will eventually roll out. Reading Chairman Mao's documents has given us more confidence and determination to liberate Taiwan. Fan Zhenhui, a fourth-year student of the Industrial Economics Department and a representative of the National People's Congress, pointed out that Chairman Mao's theory not only guided the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, but also pointed out to the people of the world: Imperialism and all reactionaries are not terrible. As long as we unite and persist in the struggle, we can achieve independence and liberation and defend world peace.
    Teachers, students, staff, and family members of Tsinghua University have conducted study and discussion with great political enthusiasm. In the discussion, many people talked about that under the current situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, the life of imperialism will not be long. Gu Zuyao and Zhang Shimin, students from the Electrical Engineering Department, said at the discussion: Chairman Mao's article gave us the strength to fight against imperialism. Imperialism is constantly increasing troops and weapons to our territorial Taiwan, and recently Dulles has stepped up the conspiracy of creating "two Chinas." These aggressive actions of American imperialism are nothing but a dying struggle and cannot scare anyone.
    Some teachers and students from departments such as Chinese, Physics, Biology, and Eastern Languages of Peking University held a forum. Communist Youth League members of the Biology Department have expressed that they will intensify their study of Marxism-Leninism, learn Chairman Mao's thinking methods and working methods, accelerate their transformation, pass the test of communism well, and give imperialism a greater blow.
    Recently, the Party committees of universities and colleges in the capital will also organize all teachers, students, and staff to further study Chairman Mao's important documents in depth.

    长自己志气　灭敌人威风
    各地干部群众认真学习毛主席论纸老虎重要文献
    新华社天津10日电　河北省广大干部和工农群众正广泛学习毛主席论“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的重要文献。
    毛主席的重要文献在人民日报发表后，河北各地就普遍组织干部、群众进行了学习和座谈。石家庄地委由地委书记傅学周向干部作了动员报告，并以一周时间在全区干部中开展了学习。藁城县组织了十一万人的座谈。滦平县在全县开展了大讨论。承德地区农村红专学校都以毛主席的文献作为政治课内容，深入工地、车间，利用休息时间，组织全体干部群众参加学习。涿县的马头人民公社，由党委向张村炼铁工地的四千多名钢铁战士、八千多名社员作了报告。对年老、有病的人，由高小学生进行了补课，把所有成年人都组织到学习中来。
    通过学习，广大干部群众更加增强了对帝国主义斗争的信心和革命干劲。很多人举出我国小麦产量超过美国、美国的经济危机和人造卫星大大落后于苏联等事实，证明美帝国主义不仅在军事上是纸老虎，在经济上、科学技术上也是纸老虎。各地区在工地上日夜鏖战的钢铁战士，学习了毛主席的文献，纷纷表示决心完成钢铁任务，打击美帝国主义，支援解放台湾。
    很多干部学习了这一重要文献后，都感到学习毛主席著作的重要意义。在学习这个文献中大家感到特别深刻的是：一、认清现象和本质的重要性，毛主席善于抓本质、抓主流，因此能够看到，革命的力量虽小，但“星星之火，可以燎原”，敌人虽然表面强大，但结果仍被人民打败。二、毛主席从战略上藐视敌人，从战术上又要重视敌人的论断，就是说对帝国主义，既要认清它纸老虎的本质，具有充分的胜利信心，又要把它当真老虎打。三、毛主席处处重视人的作用，在战争问题上反对“唯武器论”，指出决定战争胜败的关键在人，不在武器，“唯武器论”“条件论”都是只见物、不见人，必须见物又见人，才能作好工作、取得胜利。
    广大干部、群众学习了毛主席的文献，更增加了加速社会主义建设、积极准备条件向共产主义逐步过渡的信心。现在河北各地党委正在组织干部、群众继续深入进行学习，深刻领会毛主席文章的伟大意义。
    新华社南宁12日电　广西僮族自治区广大干部和群众，热烈学习毛主席论“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文献。中共自治区直属机关党委、南宁市委和柳州市委等，都已发出组织学习的通知。柳州市委的通知认为，这一伟大的革命文献，是帮助我们正确认识一切反动派必定灭亡，革命事业必定胜利这个真理的武器。自治区直属机关已举行了一次报告会，会后普遍进行座谈。南宁市委正在训练宣传干部，准备在全市群众中广泛组织报告，开展学习讨论。
    最近几天，新华书店广西分店已发行了毛主席论“纸老虎”一书达六万多册。全区各地的预订数字正不断增加，至11日已达二十多万册。
    这个文献已成为人们日常谈论的中心。每一个人看到了毛主席英明的预见，无不深深感到毛主席哲学思想的伟大，对战胜敌人的信心更为坚定。出席广西军区党代会的一部分代表举行座谈会的时候，右江红八军老战士、现任玉林军分区副司令员黄国栏，从他二十几年的革命斗争经历，说明每个地方每次斗争经验，都证明毛主席的英明论断。他说：1932年红八军离开右江北上后，国民党反动派张发奎等连续用两个军的兵力扫荡右江革命根据地，企图摧毁当时留下的薄弱的革命力量。但是，在这些年里，革命力量不仅没被消灭掉，反而一天天壮大起来，直到斗争胜利。
    新华社12日讯　首都各高等院校的师生员工连日以来热烈学习毛主席的“论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”这一重要文献，还举行讨论和座谈。经过学习，大家进一步解放了思想，装武了头脑，坚定了建设共产主义事业的信心。
    中国人民大学的工业经济系、新闻系、哲学系、法律系等师生员工广泛地学习了这个重要文献，连下放到农村劳动锻炼的师生们，也抽出时间来进行讨论。工业经济系四年级学生、全国纺织工业劳动模范陈树兰说：帝国主义国家不断发生经济危机，日薄西山，而我们国家却飞快跃进，蒸蒸日上。全世界人民支持我们，反对帝国主义。美帝国主义虽然还侵占我国台湾，但终究是要滚出去的。读了毛主席的文献，使我们更有信心和决心解放台湾。工业经济系四年级学生、全国人民代表大会代表范祯辉指出，毛主席的理论不但指导了中国人民革命的胜利，而且也给全世界人民指明：帝国主义和一切反动派不可怕，只要团结起来，坚持斗争，就能获得独立和解放，保卫世界和平。
    清华大学的师生员工和家属都以极大的政治热情进行了学习和讨论。在讨论中，很多人都谈到，在目前东风压倒西风的形势下，帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。电机系学生顾祖耀、张世民在讨论会上说：毛主席的文章给了我们向帝国主义斗争的力量。帝国主义不断往我国领土台湾增加兵力和武器，最近杜勒斯又加紧制造“两个中国”的阴谋，美帝国主义这些侵略行为不过是垂死的挣扎，是吓不倒任何人的。
    北京大学的中文、物理、生物、东语等系部分师生举行了座谈。生物系的共青团员们都纷纷表示要加紧学习马列主义，学习毛主席的思想方法和工作方法，加紧改造自己，过好共产主义关，给帝国主义更大打击。
    最近期间，首都各高等院校党委还要组织全体师生员工进一步深入地学习毛主席这一重要文献。
