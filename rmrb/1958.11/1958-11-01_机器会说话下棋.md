    Machine Talks and Plays Chess
    Do you believe that a machine can talk and play chess? A special-purpose digital electronic computer will give you a satisfactory answer.
    On this beautiful machine, there is a chessboard and chess pieces. It plays "Three Piles Chess," a popular Chinese ancient folk game. The person who wants to play chess only needs to give the machine a signal, and it will decide who goes first. If you go first, it will say, "Please make your move." If you make an illegal move against the rules of chess, it will say, "You are cheating." When you lose, it still says in that calm, peaceful tone, "You lost."
    This machine was made by young teachers and students of the Electronic Computer Department of Harbin Institute of Technology as part of their work-study program. The average age of the seven young teachers who were responsible for the design and adjustment of this machine is only twenty-five years old. The people who undertook the manufacturing were all first and second year students. They dared to think and dared to do, successfully welding the complicated circuits, and gained a lot of knowledge about this cutting-edge science from the actual manufacturing activities.

    机器会说话下棋
    你相信机器会说话、能下棋吗？一架专用数字电子计算机会给你满意的回答。
    这台漂亮的机器上，有棋盘和棋子。它是中国古代民间流行的三堆棋。要下棋的人，只要给机器一个讯号，它会决定由谁先走。如果由你先走，它就说：“请你走。”如果你不按下棋的规则乱走，它会说：“你犯规了。”当你输了时，它仍然用那种沉静、平和的声调说：“你输了。”
    这台机器是哈尔滨工业大学电子计算机专业的青年师生开展勤工俭学以后制成的。担任这台机器的设计和调整工作的七位青年教师的平均年龄只有二十五岁。担任制造工作的都是一、二年级的学生。他们敢想、敢做，成功地焊接了复杂的线路，从实际的制造活动中得到了关于这门尖端科学的许多知识。
