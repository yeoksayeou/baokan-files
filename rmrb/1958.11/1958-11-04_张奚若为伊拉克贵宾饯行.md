Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd—Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, hosted a banquet tonight to bid farewell to the Iraqi cultural delegation headed by Mr. Abed Zarzara.

    In his farewell speech at the banquet, Mr. Zarzara spoke passionately. He said that the people of Iraq and China support each other in the struggle against imperialism, and that our common enemies, whether in Taiwan or in the Arab world, will be utterly defeated. Zarzara also spoke about his impressions of visiting various parts of China for more than a month.

    At the beginning of the banquet, Zhang Xiruo delivered a speech to welcome and bid farewell to the Iraqi friends. He thanked the Iraqi people for their support to the Chinese people in the struggle against American imperialism. He said that the Chinese people will always stand together with the Iraqi people at the forefront of the struggle against colonialism and wars of aggression. The forced withdrawal of American and British aggressor troops from Lebanon and Jordan is another major victory for the people of the Middle East and the people of the world in their anti-imperialist struggle. At the same time, it once again proves that imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger.

    Among those present at the banquet tonight were Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; Luo Jun, Vice President of the China-Iraq Friendship Association; and Sa Kongliao, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, and others. Counselor Shebini and Badrone of the Embassy of the United Arab Republic in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

    张奚若为伊拉克贵宾饯行
    据新华社3日讯　对外文化联络委员会主任张奚若今晚举行宴会，欢送以阿布德·扎尔扎拉团长为首的伊拉克文化代表团。
    扎尔扎拉团长在宴会上发表了热情的告别讲话。他说，伊中两国人民在反帝国主义斗争中互相支援，我们的共同敌人无论在台湾或是在阿拉伯世界都将遭到彻底失败。扎尔扎拉还谈到了这次在中国各地参观访问一个多月的印象。
    张奚若在宴会开始时致词欢送伊拉克朋友。他感谢伊拉克人民在中国反对美帝国主义的斗争中所给予中国人民的支持。他说，中国人民将永远同伊拉克人民一起站在反对殖民主义和反对侵略战争的最前线。美英侵略军被迫撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，是中东人民和世界人民反帝国主义斗争又一重大胜利，同时，也再一次证明帝国主义不过是纸老虎。
    出席今晚宴会的，有外交部副部长章汉夫，对外文化联络委员会副主任张致祥，中国伊拉克友好协会副会长罗俊，民族事务委员会副主任萨空了等多人。阿拉伯联合共和国驻中国大使馆参赞谢宾尼和巴德朗也应邀出席宴会。
