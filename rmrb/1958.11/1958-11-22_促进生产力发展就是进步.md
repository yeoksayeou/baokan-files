Promoting the Development of Productive Forces is Progress
　　Wang Zhenguo

Was the change from the supply system to the wage system for cadre待遇 in the early days of liberation progress or regression? This should be determined by its effect on social productive forces. In my opinion, the change from the supply system to the wage system in the early days of liberation was a means of correctly handling contradictions among the people. It mobilized all positive factors and turned negative factors into positive factors. This is because in the early days of liberation, the political consciousness of most people was still very low. If the supply system were implemented, it would make some people content with the status quo, dependent on the government, and unable to fully exert their enthusiasm and creativity. This would be detrimental to the development of social productive forces.

As for some comrades who believe that the supply system should be maintained for veteran cadres while implementing the wage system, I disagree. If some people implement the supply system while others implement the wage system, it will not only create difficulties for economic accounting, but also create disunity between new and old comrades. This is because whether implementing the supply system or the wage system is irrelevant to veteran cadres who have been tempered for a long time. However, for new comrades who have not undergone much tempering, the situation is different. If the supply system continues to be promoted among veteran cadres, it will give newly participating comrades the feeling that the Party and the state do not regard them as their own people, and that their relationship with the state is only an employment relationship. This will inevitably hinder the enthusiasm and creativity of new comrades, create estrangement between new and old comrades, and thus hinder the development of social productive forces.

    促进生产力发展就是进步
    王振国
    解放初期干部待遇由供给制改为工资制是进步还是退步？这应该由它对社会生产力作用来决定。我认为，解放初期由供给制改为工资制，是正确处理人民内部矛盾的一种手段。它调动了一切积极因素，并化消极因素为积极因素。这是因为解放初期，大多数的人们的政治觉悟还是很低的。如果实行供给制，那就会使一部分人安于现状，依赖政府，不充分发挥自己的积极性和创造性。这对社会生产力的发展是不利的。
    至于有的同志认为，在实行工资制的同时，应该在老干部中继续保持着供给制。我却不以为然。如果一部分人实行供给制，而另一部分人却实行工资制，那就不仅会给经济核算带来困难，而且更会造成新老同志之间的不团结。这是因为实行供给制也好，实行工资制也好，对于久经锻炼的老干部来说是无所谓的。但是，对于未经过多少锻炼的新同志来说，情形就不同了。如果在老干部当中继续推行供给制，那就会给新参加革命的同志这样的感觉：党和国家不把他们当作自己人，他们和国家的关系只是一种雇佣关系。这就必然会妨碍新同志的积极性和创造性的发挥，造成新老同志之间的隔阂，从而妨碍了社会生产力的发展。
