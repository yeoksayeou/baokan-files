Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: "The flowing water in the Yalu River never ceases, the pine trees on Changbai Mountain are evergreen forever; this is the eternal symbol of the friendship between China and North Korea. Four thousand years of people's friendship is as close as milk and water, and in the last eight years it has become a crystallization of blood and sweat…." Inside the Huai Ren Tang, the goose-yellow velvet curtain slowly opened with the powerful prologue poem recited by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea.

The China People's Volunteer Army Performing Arts Troupe's report-back performance to the people of the motherland had begun. The stage showed the raging flames of war on the southern bank of the Yalu River eight years ago, and the volunteer army heroes embarked on their journey in the majestic war songs. The song and dance revue "Volunteer Army War Song" performed by the Volunteer Army Performing Arts Troupe tonight vividly depicts the great epic of the Chinese and North Korean people fighting side by side in those years.

Party and state leaders Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Li Jishen, and Guo Moruo, heads of various departments of state organs, people's organizations, democratic parties, and people from all walks of life in the capital watched tonight's report-back performance.

The Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, and embassy staff were invited to watch the performance.

At tonight's event, the Volunteer Army Performing Arts Troupe also performed wonderful programs such as "Motherland, I Return to Your Side," "Poor American Potatoes," "Celebrating the Bumper Harvest," and "Farewell to Korea." These programs, with moving facts and short, lively art forms, reflected the lofty patriotism and internationalism of the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, as well as their heroic image, and were warmly welcomed by the audience.

After the report-back performance was completely over, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Ambassador Li Yong-ho, accompanied by General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping, went on stage to meet the actors and presented them with flower baskets. At this time, everyone stood up and congratulated the success of the performance with a long and warm applause.

Finally, the actors gathered at the gate of Huai Ren Tang and enthusiastically saw everyone off in the deafening sound of gongs and drums, thanking the party and state leaders and the loved ones of the motherland for their kind care. (Attached picture)
