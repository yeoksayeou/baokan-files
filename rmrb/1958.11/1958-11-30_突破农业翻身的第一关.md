    Breaking Through the First Hurdle for Agricultural Turnaround
    Zhang Shiying, Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Jilin Provincial Committee

    The deep plowing campaign in Jilin Province this autumn was carried out simultaneously with the intense autumn harvest and the mass steelmaking movement. After more than two months of nationwide mobilization and round-the-clock hard work, as of November 26, a total of 50,092,500 mu of land had been deeply plowed. In terms of the overall situation in the province, the requirement to deeply plow all arable land once before next year has been basically successfully completed. And the requirements of plowing basic farmland more than one chi deep, high-yield farmland more than three chi deep, and general farmland more than seven cun deep have also been basically achieved. This is a major revolution in the agricultural cropping system of Jilin Province, and it is the first hurdle to overcome in striving for a major agricultural turnaround next year.

    Jilin Province's total grain output in 1958 was 14 billion jin, an increase of more than 40% compared to 1957. Compared with the agricultural production increases in the past few years, this is a leap forward, but compared with the national agricultural increase rate, the increase is still relatively small. Agricultural production in the province has not fundamentally turned around. The reasons for this, in addition to the fact that rectification is not thorough enough in some areas and the problems of the two roads and two work styles have not been completely resolved, are mainly due to the fact that the struggle between the two cropping systems of "wide ridges and shallow plowing, extensive planting and meager harvest" and "deep plowing and close planting, less planting and more harvest" has not been completely resolved in the minds of the vast number of cadres and masses. The white flag has not been completely pulled down, and the red flag has not been firmly planted. Many cadres and masses are still bound by the theories of "conditions determine everything", habitual thinking, and exceptionalism, and their minds have not been completely liberated.

    The deep plowing campaign in Jilin Province is a sharp struggle between the two lines and two cropping systems of "deep plowing versus shallow plowing" and "intensive cultivation versus extensive planting," and it is also a sharp struggle between advanced and conservative thinking. At the beginning of the deep plowing campaign, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the call to "turn the soil, turn the heart first." Facts have proved that to make the deep plowing campaign develop rapidly, it is necessary to mobilize cadres and the masses to speak out, debate, establish opposing views, criticize right-leaning conservatism, and liberate thinking. The main content of the debates in many places at the beginning was whether deep plowing could increase production. Some right-leaning conservatives and well-to-do middle peasants argued: "The temperature in the Northeast is low, and deep plowing makes the soil cold, which is not good for crop growth. Not only will it not increase production, but it will reduce production." Tang Wancai, a well-to-do middle peasant of the Hongxing People's Commune in Changling County, said: "The land is plowed so deep, the soil is turned upside down, and there will definitely be a reduction in production next year." Some well-to-do middle peasants even claimed to be experienced and said: "Living a thousand years and experiencing ten thousand things, our ancestors for eight generations have never heard of turning the land. If young people don't listen to the old farmers, don't blame us if you harvest less grain." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants actively responded to the Party's call and used many examples to illustrate the benefits of deep plowing. They used big-character posters and speeches at debates to put forward "Agriculture must pass the test, first grasp deep plowing," "Every inch of land deeply plowed is worth an extra layer of manure," "One chi of land deeply plowed will turn bad land into good land, deep roots and lush foliage produce more grain, don't miss the good opportunity for deep plowing," "The land is plowed deep, yellow soil turns into gold, apply fertilizer in layers, and the granaries will be full of bumper harvests." After a fierce debate in various places, the skeptics and opponents were refuted. But they were not reconciled and put forward "Although deep plowing is good, there is a lot of work to do in the autumn and time is short," "There is less land and more people in Guannei (areas within the Great Wall), so they can deeply plow, but there is more land and fewer people in the Northeast, and there is a shortage of labor and livestock, plus it gets cold and freezes early, so we can only plow less and shallower. We cannot deeply plow all of it." Some well-to-do middle peasants argued: "Deep plowing requires a lot of labor and yields little profit. It is better to open up wasteland and plant more land." After calculating time, tasks, progress, and comparing energy on-site visits, the broad masses once again refuted habitual thinking and the theory of "conditions determine everything." After a major debate, the awareness and confidence of cadres and the masses were rapidly increased. Cadres generally reflected, "To plow the land quickly, we must rely on putting politics in command," "To plow the land, we must first turn the heart. One inch of turning the heart is worth three chi of plowing."

    While solving the ideological problems of the masses, it is necessary to quickly solve the two work styles of cadres—namely, bureaucracy and the mass line—and carry out competition movements among cadres. Experience has proven that where the leadership has conservative ideas and does not follow the mass line, the progress of deep plowing is slow; where the leading cadres' thinking is not completely liberated and they lack drive, they only complain about difficulties. The speed of deep plowing is not a problem of the masses being backward, but a problem of the leadership being ideologically conservative. As long as there is a strong leading backbone, it can drive the broad masses forward. In the sixth management area of Taiping Township in Shuangyang County, the progress of plowing was very slow, only fifteen mu were plowed per day. After mobilizing the masses to debate, the work of the original branch secretary was revoked, and a new branch secretary was elected to lead the plowing, and the daily plowing progress reached 258 mu, an increase of seventeen times. In Liming People's Commune in Changling County, after the wealthy middle peasant production team leader Yan Xisheng, who hindered deep plowing, was removed and replaced by the poor peasant Jiang Dehe, who had communist ideas, the number of plows increased from four to eight, and the daily plowing increased from 30 mu to 165 mu.

    After rapidly changing the work style of cadres, all localities generally put forward "Secretary takes command and goes to the front line in person." Cadres should eat, live, and work with the peasants, and be good commanders, combatants, and technicians. Work should focus on grasping ideology, measures, and progress. Changling County put forward the call of "Secretary takes command, the branch guarantees, Party members take the lead, Youth League members are vanguards, the whole Party acts, and all the people go into battle," and universally promoted the methods of six fixings (tasks, plots of land, tools, manpower and animal power, quality, and remuneration); four implementations (implementation to the management area, production team, production group, and individual); three grasps (ideology, typical examples, and progress); two guarantees (quantity, quality and time); and one promotion (rope-drawn plow). Therefore, a vigorous mass movement quickly unfolded. Not only did the men, women, old, and young of the peasant masses participate in the deep plowing movement, but many teachers and students, urban residents, and family members of workers were also organized to bring their own tools and food to the countryside to support the deep plowing movement. In order to seize time, grab progress, and overcome the frozen ground, the masses in Kaitong County described the soaring enthusiasm of the deep plowing army, saying: "The sky is full of stars, the ground is full of lights, there is no sound of birds for miles, only the sound of plows and shovels." In order to carry out a deep plowing blitz, Qian'an County formed a field army corps, set up camps on the spot, and the masses were in high spirits and sang songs: "The field army company is a hero, sleeps on the battlefield, eats in the field, seizes every minute to grab time, plows the ground three chi deep to loosen the soil, and next year's 'satellite' will definitely go to heaven."

    In the short period of two months, completing the task of deeply plowing 50 million mu of land in the province is indeed a very arduous task. It is not enough to rely solely on hard work, intense work, and day and night work. Therefore, all localities held "Zhuge Liang meetings" to mobilize the masses to contribute ideas and suggestions, and actively carried out tool reform movements. Through practice, various deep plowing experiences were created. According to incomplete statistics, during the movement, 31,235 rope-drawn plows and 656,000 various deep plowing tools were manufactured and promoted. Many places created advanced experiences in combining human and animal power. In manual plowing, Yongji County promoted the plowing method of "four ditches connecting the soil, five people working together." In the later stage of deep plowing, in order to break through the frozen soil layer, the methods of "pulling the knife to break the soil" and "explosive blasting" were adopted. In order to carry out the autumn harvest and autumn plowing at the same time, the Happiness Road People's Commune in Jiaohe County put forward the slogan "The car does not run empty, and people do not come empty-handed." Large carts went to the field to pull manure, and came back to pull crops. These experiences greatly accelerated the deep plowing progress and saved labor.

    In order to accelerate the progress of plowing, all localities generally established and improved the organization and system of "labor organization militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization." Many places adopted large-scale operations, concentrated forces to break through in areas, and adopted the method of setting up large camps in the field, where people ate, lived, studied, and held meetings. The province established more than 47,000 rural public canteens, more than 68,000 nurseries and kindergartens, and more than 8,000 sewing factories, liberating 1.3 million women from household chores and enabling them to participate in production. When large-scale operations are carried out, people's labor intensity is very high, and it is necessary to care about people's lives. In particular, it is even more important to run public canteens well and ensure that members eat enough and eat well. The deep plowing team collectively boarded and lodged, and strived to rest on time.

    In the competition movement, new deep plowing records were constantly created. Yushu County once plowed 150,000 mu in a day. Through competition, evaluation, major inspections, and major collaboration, the problems of uneven progress and rough quality were solved in a timely manner. In the heated competition movement, political work took the lead, ensuring that the masses had full and lasting labor enthusiasm.

    突破农业翻身的第一关
    中共吉林省委农村工作部部长　张士英
    吉林省今年秋季的深翻地运动，是同紧张的秋收和全民大炼钢铁运动同时并举的，经过两个多月的全民总动员，日夜奋战，到11月26日为止，共深翻地五千零九十二万五千亩。就全省总的情况来说，已经基本上胜利地完成了把明年全部耕地普遍深翻一遍的要求。而且也基本上实现了基本田翻一尺以上，高额丰产田翻三尺以上，一般田翻七寸以上的要求。这是吉林省农业耕作制度上的大革命，是争取明年农业大翻身的第一关。
    吉林省1958年粮食总产量为一百四十亿斤，比1957年增产了40％以上。这和过去几年来农业增产的情况相比较，是一个跃进，但和全国农业增产的速度相比较，增产幅度还比较小。全省农业生产还没有在根本上大翻身。其原因除了一部分地区整风还不够彻底，两条道路和两种作风的问题还没有完全解决以外，主要是在广大干部和群众的思想上，对“宽垅浅耕，广种薄收”和“深耕密植，少种多收”的两种耕作制度的斗争，还没有彻底解决，白旗没有完全拔掉，红旗没有牢固地插起来，许多干部和群众还受着唯条件论、习惯论和特殊论的束缚，思想还没有完全解放。
    吉林省的深翻地运动，是一场尖锐的“深耕与浅耕”、“精耕细作与广种薄收”的两条路线和两种耕作制度的斗争过程，也是先进思想和保守思想尖锐斗争的过程。在深翻地运动一开始，省委就提出“翻地先翻心”的号召，事实证明了，要使深翻地运动迅速开展起来，必须发动干部和群众鸣放辩论，树立对立面，批判右倾保守，解放思想。许多地方开始辩论的内容，主要是深翻地能不能增产，一些右倾保守的人和富裕中农提出：“东北气温低，深翻土发凉，长不好庄稼，不但不能增产，反会减产”。长岭县红星人民公社富裕中农唐万才说：“地翻这样深，土翻的乱七八糟，来年非减产不可”，有的富裕中农甚至以有经验自居，提出：“活一千过一万，祖辈八代都没听说过把地翻，小伙子不听老农话，少打粮食可莫怨。”广大贫农和下中农积极响应党的号召，用许多事例说明深翻的好处。他们用大字报和在辩论会上提出“农业要过关，首先抓深翻”，“土地深翻一寸，顶上多上一层粪”，“土地深翻一尺，坏地也会变良田，根深叶茂打粮多，深翻良机莫错过”，“土地翻的深，黄土变成金，分层多施肥，丰收粮满囤”。各地经过一场激烈的辩论，怀疑派、反对派被驳倒了。但是他们并不甘心，又提出“深翻虽然好，就是秋季活多时间短”“关内地少人多能深翻，东北地多人少劳畜力不足，加上天冷上冻早，只能少翻浅翻。不能深翻全部翻”。有的富裕中农提出：“深耕地，费工多，得利小，不如开荒多种地”。广大群众经过算时间、算任务、算进度、比干劲，现场参观，又一次驳倒了习惯论和唯条件论。经过一场大辩论，迅速提高了干部和群众的觉悟和信心。干部普遍反映“翻地要快，全靠政治挂帅”，“翻地先翻心，翻心一寸，翻地三尺”。
    在解决了群众思想问题的同时，必须迅速解决干部的两种作风——即官僚主义和群众路线问题，在干部中开展竞赛运动。经验证明，那里领导上有保守思想不走群众路线，那里深翻地的进度就慢；那里领导干部思想没有彻底解放，干劲不足，那里就光叫喊困难。深翻地进度的快慢，不是群众落后问题，而是领导思想保守问题，只要有坚强的领导骨干，就可以带动广大群众前进。双阳县太平乡第六管理区，翻地进度很慢，每天只翻十五亩，经过发动群众辩论，撤销了原来支部书记的工作，选出了新的支部书记来领导翻地，每天翻地进度达到二百五十八亩，提高了十七倍。长岭县黎明人民公社，撤销了阻碍深翻地的富裕中农生产队长彦喜胜，换上了有共产主义思想的贫农姜德和以后，由四副犁杖增加到八副，由每天翻地三十亩增加到一百六十五亩。
    在迅速改变了干部作风后，各地普遍提出“书记挂帅、亲临前线”，干部要做到与农民同吃、同住、同劳动，做好指挥员、战斗员、技术员，工作要抓思想、抓措施、抓进度。长岭县提出：“书记挂帅，支部做保证，党员打先锋，团员做尖兵，全党动手，万民齐出征”的号召，并且普遍地推广了六固定（任务、地块、工具、人畜力、质量、报酬）；四落实（落实到管理区、生产队、生产小组和个人）；三抓（思想、典型、进度）；二保证（数质量和时间）；一推广（绳索牵引犁）的方法。因此，一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，迅速开展起来了。不仅农民群众中的男女老少参加了深翻地运动，许多学校师生、城市居民、职工家属也都组织起来，自带工具和口粮，下乡支援深翻地运动。为了抢时间，抢进度，战胜地冻，开通县的群众形容翻地大军的冲天干劲说：“天上满天星，地下灯成龙，万里无鸟音，只有犁锹声。”乾安县为了突击深翻，组成了野战兵团，就地安营扎寨，群众情绪很高，并编歌高唱：“野战连，是好汉，战场睡，野外餐，分秒必争抢时间，地翻三尺土发渲，明年‘卫星’定上天。”
    在短短的两个月时间里，要完成全省五千万亩地的深翻任务，确实是一个很艰巨的任务。光靠猛干、苦干、昼夜干是不行的。因此，各地都召开了“诸葛亮会”，发动群众献策献计，积极开展工具改革运动，通过实践，创造了各种各样的深耕经验。据不完全统计，在运动中，制造和推广了绳索牵引犁三万一千二百三十五台，各种深翻工具六十五万六千件。许多地方创造了人畜力结合的先进经验。在人工翻地中，永吉县推广了“四沟串土，五人联合作战”的翻地法。在深翻地的后期，为了揭破冻土层，采用了“拉刀破土法”，“炸药爆破法”。蛟河县幸福之路人民公社，为了使秋收和秋翻地同时进行，提出了“车不空运，人不空手”的口号，大车下地拉粪，回来拉庄稼，这些经验大大加快了深翻进度，节省了劳动力。
    为了加速翻地进度，各地普遍建立和健全了“劳动组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化”的组织和制度。许多地方采取了大兵团作战，集中力量分片突击，并采取野外扎大营，吃饭、住宿、学习、开会都在田间。全省共办了农村公共食堂四万七千多处，托儿所、幼儿园六万八千多处，缝纫厂八千多处，使一百三十万妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加了生产。在大兵团作战的时候，人们劳动强度很高，必须关心人们的生活。特别是办好公共食堂，保证社员吃得饱，吃得好，更为重要。深翻队伍集体食宿，努力作到按时休息。
    在竞赛运动中，不断创造翻地新纪录，榆树县曾日翻地十五万亩。通过竞赛评比，大检查，大协作，及时解决了进度不平衡和质量粗糙的问题。在热火朝天的竞赛运动中，政治工作一马当先，保证了群众有饱满的和持久的劳动热情。
