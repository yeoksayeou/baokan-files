    Studying Theory Really Solves Problems
    Liu Fengming
    In the old society, I toiled for landlords for thirteen years. My father was killed by the Japanese devils, and my mother and I begged for food for several years, living in hunger and cold. At that time, going to school was a dream!
    After the land reform, I turned over and became a village cadre. Because I was illiterate, I couldn't write reports or read documents, and I ran into many snags in my work. In 1950, the Party called on us to learn to read, and the village organized a literacy school, which I joined. But when I looked at the words on the blackboard, they were just a blurry white mass, and the more I looked, the more confused I became. After a lot of ideological struggle and overcoming many practical difficulties, I finally obtained a literacy graduation certificate in 1954. I was extremely happy.
    Although I got rid of the label of being illiterate, it wasn't all smooth sailing! I still ran into snags in my work. Especially during the 1955 village cadre re-election, the masses raised many opinions about me, saying I was "always pushing." Hearing these words, I got really angry! I thought, I work hard all year long, and the result is that I'm not liked. So I went to the district committee secretary and said I couldn't do it anymore. The district committee secretary reasoned with me, helped me analyze the problem, and told me to buy a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." He said that Chairman Mao had the best methods for working, and he wanted me to study hard.
    After returning, I went to the Xinhua Bookstore and bought a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume III. Learning theory wasn't smooth sailing either. Some terms I didn't understand, and when I couldn't go on, I wanted to give up. But when I thought of the district committee secretary's teaching: "As long as you study theory well, you will have more ways to work," my determination grew stronger again. Later, when I encountered terms I didn't understand, I wrote them down and asked people. What Chairman Mao said was very practical, not at all roundabout, and the more I studied, the more motivated I became! Now that the rural areas are in the Great Leap Forward, time is even tighter, so in order not to interrupt my studies, I adopted the method of keeping the book with me at all times, and keeping myself with the book. In this way, I studied thirty-six political theory books, including "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume II, "Party Constitution Teaching Materials," and "History of Social Development."
    After reading Chairman Mao's works, I learned to follow the mass line and changed my work methods. In the past, because I easily got angry, I forced the tasks assigned by the superiors on people regardless of the specific situation and conditions, and always thought that "the folks are stubborn and have dead brains," so many people were dissatisfied with me and called me "Liu the Tiger." Since reading Chairman Mao's "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," I felt like I had found a treasure, and I studied it four or five times over and over again. Then, I suddenly realized: Chairman Mao is so particular about work methods, but in the past I just blindly charged ahead, not caring about the opinions of the masses, and always thinking that the masses were backward. In fact, the reason why the masses' thinking is not clear for the time being is precisely because we cadres have not gone to the masses to do propaganda and explanation. My work was not done well, and the masses were not satisfied, because when I was doing my work, my subjective thinking did not conform to the objective thinking of the masses. Therefore, the responsibility lies with me and not with the masses.
    Afterwards, I changed my work methods. For example, in the task of persuading people to purchase public bonds, I no longer apportioned the task like in previous years. I understood that I should first have the cadres take the lead in subscribing, and then explain the reasons to the masses and do a good job of propaganda. As a result, the task was quickly completed. The work was easier than before, and the masses also said: "Old Liu has changed! This time we are really willing." These facts have deeply educated me:
      Studying theory really solves problems!

    学理论真解决问题
    刘凤鸣
    在旧社会里，我一直给地主家扛了十三年活。父亲被日本鬼子打死了，母亲领着我要了几年饭，过着饥寒交迫的生活。那时，念书是个梦想！
    土地革改后翻了身，我当了村干部。因为没有文化，我既不会写报告，又不会看文件，在工作中碰了不少钉子。1950年党号召我们学文化，村里组织了民校，我报名参加了。但是，一看黑板上的字，白糊糊一大片，越看越糊涂。经过不少思想斗争，克服了很多实际困难，1954年我终于获得了扫盲毕业证书。我高兴极了。
    虽然摘掉了文盲帽子，却并没有万事大吉啊！我在工作上还尽碰钉子。特别是在1955年改选村干部时，群众给我提了许多意见，说我是“尽讲压力派”。听到这些话，我可真火了！我想，一年辛辛苦苦地干工作，结果是不讨好。于是，我找上区委书记，说啥我也不能干了。区委书记讲了很多道理给我听，帮我分析问题，还要我买一本“毛泽东选集”。他说，毛主席工作最有办法，要我好好学习。
    回来后，我到新华书店买了一本“毛泽东选集”第三卷。理论学习也不是一帆风顺的。有的名词不懂，看不下去了就想搁下；但是，我想到区委书记的教导：“只要学习好理论，工作办法就能多了。”决心就又大了。以后，我碰到不懂的名词，就记下来问人。毛主席说的话很实在，一点也不拐弯抹角，我越学越有劲啦！现在农村大跃进，时间更紧了，我为了不间断学习，采取书不离人、人不离书的办法。这样又学了“毛泽东选集”第二卷、“党章教材”和“社会发展史”等三十六本政治理论书籍。
    读了毛主席的著作，我学会了走群众路线，改变了工作方法。过去因为我动不动就爱发火，对上级布置的任务不管具体情况和条件硬灌，老认为“老乡是死脑瓜骨，顽固”，所以许多人对我不满，叫我“刘大虎”。自从看了毛主席的“关于领导方法的若干问题”，我好像得到宝贝似地，一遍再一遍地学了四、五次。于是，我恍然大悟：毛主席都这样讲究工作方法，我过去却尽是蛮干一通，谁管群众意见不意见的，还老认为群众落后。实际上群众的思想一时搞不通，正是因为咱们当干部的没有到群众中去作宣传解释的缘故。我的工作做得不好，群众不满意，是因为在我做工作的时候，我的主观不符合客观的群众思想。因此，责任在我而不在群众。
    以后，我就改变了工作方法。例如，我在劝购公债等任务中就不像往年那样摊派了。我懂得先干部带头认购，再向群众讲清道理，作好宣传，结果很快就完成了任务。工作比过去容易了，群众还说：“老刘变样了呵！这回我们可真是自愿”。这些事实深深地教育了我：
      学理论真解决问题！
