Yang Caixue, a second lieutenant assistant in the Armed Forces Department of Bijiang County, Yunnan, has forged a deep friendship with the fraternal ethnic groups in the Sixth Village of the Fourth District over the past year. The people of the Sixth Village love him, saying he is a good cadre of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The elders call him "Wo Ran" (meaning "my son"), and no one in the village wants him to leave; they want him to settle down in the Sixth Village. Once, Yang Caixue went to the county for a meeting and didn't return for more than a month. The masses were always thinking of him and wrote two letters urging him to come back. Later, the masses, fearing that he would not return if he went, only allowed him to take a quilt to the county for the meeting.

The Sixth Village is an administrative village inhabited by the Lisu and Lama ethnic groups, with more than 240 households, the majority being Lisu people. To the east of the village is the turbulent Nujiang River, and to the west is the towering Gaoligong Mountain with its perpetual snow. The village is also located on a large mountain. Due to traffic obstruction, the work started relatively late. Although two mutual aid teams and a primary cooperative were set up in 1956, production still maintained the primitive cultivation method of "slash-and-burn". The people's lives were still very poor.

In February 1957, Yang Caixue was assigned to work in the Sixth Village, with the task of leading the masses in production and combining this with joint defense and armed work. Before this, the Sixth Village had never seen the People's Liberation Army. In their memory, none of those wearing yellow uniforms (referring to soldiers) were good; they either burned, killed, robbed, or conscripted soldiers. The crimes of the Kuomintang reactionary army in the Sixth Village would never be forgotten. This time, seeing Yang Caixue wearing a yellow military uniform, they didn't know what he was there for. At first, they avoided him from a distance, even closing their doors. Faced with this situation, Yang Caixue explained and publicized while taking practical actions, eating, living, and working with the masses. He spent his own money to buy a set of commonly used farm tools (such as hoes, sickles, and carrying baskets). He went out early and returned late, carrying manure and thatch. As time went on, the masses' knots were untied, and everyone smiled and approached him.

The problem at hand was how to lead the masses in production and completely change the backward and poor conditions in production and life. To increase production, it was necessary to change the backward farming methods and old habits of not accumulating fertilizer, not applying fertilizer, and not planting according to the seasons. However, the rumors that "carrying urine manure will cause hair loss" and "crops that have been fertilized with urine manure don't taste good and will cause stomach aches if eaten" were deeply "entrenched" in the minds of the masses. Yang Caixue used the method of "doing it for everyone to see and using facts to break superstitions" to plant two-tenths of an acre of corn and four-tenths of an acre of experimental rice in the village, using the methods of "ditch planting, deep plowing and careful cultivation, and applying fertilizer and topdressing." The corn and rice grew fat and strong, with large ears. Therefore, he organized the masses to visit and seized the opportunity to publicize the benefits of accumulating fertilizer, deep plowing, careful cultivation, and timely planting. This time, the masses' thinking was clear, and superstitions were broken. Under his leadership and the active efforts of the masses, grain production increased by more than double.

Yang Caixue also did a very good job in combining work arrangements. With the development of production and the improvement of living conditions, the masses' awareness and patriotism greatly increased. According to the demands of the people and the instructions of higher authorities, under the slogan of "protecting production, protecting the fruits of labor, and protecting the hometown," the Sixth Village also established a Lisu people's armed force - a joint defense team - while carrying out "youth league construction" work. A people's defense line was built in the Sixth Village. The joint defense team not only protected the peaceful life of the people in the Sixth Village but also became a strong force in production throughout the village.

For the happy life of the people in the Sixth Village, Yang Caixue always took the lead in helping the masses find solutions and encouraging them to overcome difficulties. This year, in the great leap forward in production, the Party Committee assigned him to be responsible for leading the Sixth Village to dig 50 ditches and reform more than 400 racks of paddy fields. He also had to participate in the district's water conservancy headquarters work. He was sometimes so busy that he couldn't even eat, and although he was sick for several days, he still insisted on staying on the construction site. This deeply moved and educated the more than 60 people who had originally wanted to go back to rest for a few days, and they all voluntarily stayed to continue working. In the construction of water conservancy, wherever there was danger, he always took the lead with the joint defense team, drilling blasting holes and blasting rocks on the hanging cliffs. Because of their active actions, a large ditch of more than 15 Chinese miles long, with more than 25,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, which was originally planned to be completed in two years, was completed in two months. Especially in the fight against drought and protection of seedlings, once the ditch collapsed, many acres of seedlings were about to wither under the fiery sun. It concerned the planting of 500 acres of newly opened paddy fields and the life of the entire village, and some of the masses cried anxiously. But with Yang Caixue there, the seedlings would never die from drought. He led the joint defense team to carry water overnight to rescue them and organized the digging of water diversion channels. After three days and two nights of hard work, the seedlings were saved and grew very well. Two old ladies were so excited that they shed tears and said, "Wo Ran, Shuang Mo (thank you), we will never forget you!"

The masses' enthusiasm for production and their love and trust in him encouraged and educated Yang Caixue, prompting him to quickly learn the ethnic language so that he could work without a translator. Only in this way could he further strengthen his relationship with the masses and jointly build and defend the border. Therefore, he learned whatever he saw and asked whatever he didn't understand. He also found an elementary school teacher to teach him the Lisu language and phonetic alphabet. In three months, he learned to speak Lisu. Now, he can use the ethnic language to vividly publicize the Party's policies and also freely talk with the masses.

    傈僳族人民的好儿子
    丽军
    在云南碧江县四区六村工作的县武装部少尉助理员杨才学，一年多来，和兄弟民族结下了深厚的友谊。六村的人民热爱他，说他是共产党毛主席的好干部，老辈称他为“窝然”（即我儿子），全村谁都不愿他离开，要他在六村安家落户。有一次，杨才学到县里开会，一月多没回来，群众老惦记着他，接连写了两封信催他回来。后来，群众因怕他去了不回来，只准他带上个被子去县里开会。
    六村，是一个傈僳族与拉马族聚居的行政村，有二百四十来户人家，其中傈僳族占多数。村的东面是波涛汹涌的怒江，西边是高入云霄、积雪不化的高黎贡山，村子也在大山上。由于交通阻隔，工作开展较迟，虽然在1956年办起了两个互助组，一个初级社，可是生产上还保持着“刀耕火种”的原始耕作方法。人民的生活还很穷苦。
    1957年2月，杨才学被分配到六村工作，任务是：领导群众搞生产；结合进行联防武装工作。六村在这以前，还从来没见过解放军，在他们的记忆里，穿黄衣服的（指当兵的）没一个是好的，不是烧杀抢劫，就是拉兵，国民党反动军队在六村的罪恶，他们永世也不会忘记的。这回，看到杨才学穿着一套黄军装，不晓得他是来干什么的，开初，见了他就远远躲开，甚至闭门不出。面临这样的情况，杨才学边解说宣传，边开始实际行动，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，自己掏钱买了一套常用的农具（如锄头、镰刀、背箩等），他早出晚归出门背粪，回来背茅草，日子一久，群众的疙瘩解除了，个个喜笑颜开，接近他了。
    摆在面前的问题是如何领导群众搞生产，彻底改变生产、生活上的落后和贫困面貌。要增产，就得改变落后的耕作方法和不积肥、不施肥、不按节令栽种的旧习惯。可是“背了尿粪要掉头发”“上了尿粪的庄稼不好吃，吃了要肚疼”的传言，深深地“盘踞”在群众的脑海里。杨才学就用“做出来给大家看，用事实打破迷信”的办法，在村边用“控塘点种，深耕细作、施肥追肥”的方法，种了两分地的包谷和四分地的试验稻谷。包谷、稻谷长得又肥又壮，穗又大。于是，他就组织群众来参观，并抓住时机宣传积肥、深耕细作，按时栽种的好处，这回群众思想通了，迷信破除了。在他的领导和群众积极努力下，粮食产量增加了一倍以上。
    杨才学在工作的安排结合上也是做得很好的。生产的发展，生活的改善，群众觉悟和爱国主义思想大大提高了，根据人民群众的要求和上级的指示，在“保卫生产，保卫劳动果实，保卫家乡”的口号下，在“建团”工作的同时，六村也建立了一支傈僳族的人民武装——联防队。在六村筑起了一条人民防线。联防队不仅保卫着六村人民的和平生活，而且成为全村在生产上的一支劲旅。
    为了六村人民的幸福生活，杨才学处处走在前头，帮助群众想办法，鼓励群众克服困难。今年，在生产大跃进中，党委分配他负责领导六村开掘水沟五十条和改水田四百多架的工作，还要他参加区的水利指挥部工作，他有时忙得连饭也顾不上吃，并且，病了好几天，仍然坚持不下工地，使原来想回去休息几天的六十多名群众深受感动和教育，也都自动留下来继续干。在修水利中，哪里危险，他总是带上联防队一马当先，在悬岩上打炮眼、炸石头。由于他们的积极行动，使一条原准备两年完工的长达十五华里，土石方达两万五千多的大水沟，在两个月里就全部完成了。特别是在抗旱保苗中，一次水沟垮了，有好多亩秧苗被火红的太阳晒得快枯死了，它关乎全村新开的五百亩稻田的栽种和全村的生活，群众有的急哭了。可是有杨才学在，秧苗绝不会旱死。他带领联防队员连夜背水抢救，组织挖引水槽，经过三天两夜的苦干，秧苗得救了，还长得很好。两位老大妈激动得流下了眼泪，说：“窝然，双莫（谢谢），永远忘不了你！”
    群众的生产劲头和对他的热爱、信赖，鼓舞教育了杨才学，促使他决心很快学会民族语言，做到不要翻译也能工作。这样才能更进一步密切同群众的关系，共同建设边疆，保卫边疆。因此他见啥就学啥，不懂就问，还找了一个小学教员来教傈僳文和拼音法。三个月他就学会了傈僳话。如今，他已经能用民族语言，生动地宣传党的政，也能和群众自由畅谈了。
