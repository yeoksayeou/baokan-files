Editor's Note:

    Turn steel into materials!
    The great battle for steel must be divided into several campaigns:
    First, hate the ore for not being iron, that is, to smelt ore into iron.
    Then, hate the iron for not being steel, that is, to refine iron into steel.
    Finally, hate the steel for not being material, that is, to roll steel into various types of steel materials. Only in this way can the steel materials be handed over to the machinery manufacturing departments, so that they will hate the materials for not being equipment, and then make various steel materials into various machines.
    Now, the great battle for 10.7 million tons of steel is already in sight of victory. The current task is: to refine iron into steel. The task is still very heavy, and we must continue to work hard. But an even more important new task is coming up, and that is to roll steel into various types of steel materials.
    To successfully complete the task of rolling steel into materials, we must give full play to the existing rolling capacity, mobilize all possible rolling machinery to participate in rolling, create various methods for rapid rolling and simple rolling, and rush to manufacture large and small rolling mills!
    This new task also requires a mass movement. We must engage in steel materials on a large scale like we did with iron and steel, so that the steel can become useful material, and then send the steel materials to machinery factories to manufacture all kinds of machinery urgently needed in various fields.
    Today, the three news items about rolling steel published in this newspaper are hoped to attract everyone's attention. Anshan Iron and Steel Company is launching a mass movement to resolutely guarantee that it will contribute one million tons of steel materials to the country in the fourth quarter. Teachers and students of the rolling steel major of Northeast Institute of Technology have used indigenous methods to create non-mandrel rolling equipment, which is a major technical creation. Xiaguan Machine Tool Factory in Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture has created a kind of indigenous rolling mill that is simple to manufacture and easy to operate. These three good news stories are representatives of many good news stories in the nationwide battle for steel materials. They reflect that a great and vigorous battle for steel materials is being launched in full swing. (Attached picture)

### 把钢变成材！

    把钢变成材！
    大战钢铁要分几个战役：
    先是恨矿不成铁，就是要把矿砂炼成铁。
    再是恨铁不成钢，就是要把铁炼成钢。
    最后是恨钢不成材，就是要把钢轧成各种类型的钢材。这样才能把钢材交给机械制造部门，要他们恨材不成器，再把各种钢材制造成各种机械和机器。
    现在，为一○七○万吨钢的大战已经胜利在望，当前的任务是：把铁炼成钢，任务仍然很重，还要继续努力。但是比这更重大的新任务跟着上来了，这就是把钢轧成各种类型的钢材。
    要顺利完成把钢轧成材的任务，就是要充分发挥现有轧钢的能力，就是要动员一切可能轧钢的机械参加轧钢，就是要创造各种快速轧钢和简易轧钢的办法，就是要赶制大大小小的轧钢机！
    这个新任务也要大搞群众运动，我们要像大搞钢铁那样来大搞钢材，才能使钢成材顶用，才能把钢材送给机械厂，制造成各方面急迫需要的各色各样的机械和机器。
    今天本报刊登的三条有关轧钢的消息希望能引起大家注意。鞍钢大搞群众运动，坚决保证在第四季度给国家贡献出一百万吨钢材。东北工学院轧钢专业师生用土法制成了无锭轧钢设备，这是一项重大的技术创造。大理白族自治区下关机床厂创造成一种制作简单和操作方便的土轧钢机。这三个好消息是全国大战钢材的斗争中很多好消息的代表，它们反映出一个声势浩大的为钢材而战的伟大战役正在全面地开展起来。（附图片）
