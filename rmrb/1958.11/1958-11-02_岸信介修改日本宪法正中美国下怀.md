Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 30th - Washington News: American officials have privately stated that the United States welcomes the Kishi Nobusuke government's amendment of the Japanese constitution in order to enable Japan to play a greater military role on the Far Eastern stage.

According to the Associated Press, American officials privately admitted that the United States has been urging Japan to play a more active role in the defense of the free world. US Secretary of State Dulles raised this issue during his meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama in September of this year. Since that meeting, the Kishi Nobusuke government has more vigorously pursued a policy of following the United States and being hostile to China.

The Associated Press revealed that the US government intends to use some concessions in the talks on revising the US-Japan Security Treaty as bait to drive the Kishi Nobusuke government to guarantee that Japan will agree to play a greater role in the common aspirations of the free world in the Far East. In order to eliminate the legal constraints on this guarantee, the United States hopes that Kishi Nobusuke will amend the constitution.

The United States acknowledges that Kishi Nobusuke is isolated in implementing the US nuclear war policy. The Associated Press said that Kishi Nobusuke is not only struggling with his opponents, but also with powerful elements within his own party, which Washington views with sympathetic regret.

### 岸信介修改日本宪法正中美国下怀

    岸信介修改日本宪法正中美国下怀
    据新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国官员们私下表示，美国欢迎岸信介政府修改日本宪法，以便使日本“在远东舞台上起更大的军事作用”。
    据美联社报道，美国官员们私下承认，美国曾经促使日本在“自由世界”的“防务”中起更积极的作用。美国国务卿杜勒斯在今年9月同日本外务相藤山爱一郎会谈的时候曾经提起这个问题。自从这次会谈以后，岸信介政府就更加起劲地奉行追随美国和敌视中国的政策。
    美联社透露，美国政府打算以美国在修改日美“安全条约”的会谈中作些“让步”为诱饵，驱使岸信介政府“保证日本将同意在自由世界在远东的共同愿望中起更大的作用”。为了消除这种“保证”的法律束缚，美国希望岸信介修改宪法。
    美国承认岸信介在执行美国的核战争政策中处境孤立。美联社说，岸信介不仅要同他的反对者斗争，而且也要同他自己党内的强有力的分子斗争，华盛顿以“同情的遗憾心情”看待这种情况。
