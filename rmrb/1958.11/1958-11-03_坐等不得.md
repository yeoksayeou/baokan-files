    Waiting Around is Not Allowed

    Regarding our commercial work, we have gained some experience in dealing with material shortages, but we have less experience in how to do a good job in commerce when materials are abundant. This year, agricultural and sideline products have had an unprecedented bumper harvest in various places. However, how to purchase and transport large quantities of agricultural and sideline products in a timely manner to meet the urgent needs of all parties is a very noteworthy issue in the current economic life.

    Some people say that the "marshal" of steel and grain is already extremely busy, and if the purchasing work is added, this contradiction will be difficult to resolve, so it is better to wait and see. We say that purchasing work cannot wait, and we must take advantage of the opportunity to get involved. The central government's directive on October 22 regarding the crash purchase and transport of agricultural and sideline products clearly pointed out: in the current purchasing and transporting of agricultural and sideline products, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, combine crash purchases with regular purchases, and combine crash transport with regular transport. While vigorously developing steel and agriculture, insert purchasing and transport movements, large-scale movements encompassing small-scale movements, and long-term movements encompassing short-term movements. The facts in many regions have proven that as long as we conscientiously implement the spirit of the central government's instructions, rely on the masses, and make reasonable arrangements for time, labor, and transportation, the purchasing and transportation work will not hinder the "marshal’s" progress. Moreover, the purchasing of agricultural and sideline products is itself a crash task. The fourth quarter of each year is the most tense moment. If we do not focus on purchasing and transportation now, not only will the materials be lost, but the more serious consequence will be affecting the daily lives of the broad masses of people and the normal production of some factories, which is also very unfavorable for supporting the "marshal."

    Some people say, "Isn't it too tense to have the 'marshal' advance and also vigorously grasp the purchasing and transportation work?" Of course, it is undeniable that an unprecedented tense situation has emerged after the "marshal" advanced. But it should also be seen that this tension is a pleasant tension, a tension of prosperity. Many great achievements in our country's construction have proven that the more tense it is, the more it can prompt people to use their brains to find solutions. In this way, solutions to overcome the tension are found, new work rules are discovered, the work tasks are completed, and the tension is transformed into ease and pleasure. Therefore, the broad masses of people like this kind of tension, and only those with serious right-leaning conservative ideas are afraid of tension. In fact, the more you fear tension, the more passive the work becomes, the fewer solutions you have, and the heavier the burden on the work becomes, which will eventually turn into more unpleasant and more tense situations.

    The current problem is still right-leaning thinking at work. They only see the tense side, but not the regularity of the tension. Agriculture and steel are long-term, large-scale movements, while commercial work is short-term and small-scale movements. This is the objective law of our country's economic construction today, and it will be the same next year. Recognizing this law, grasping this law, and taking some specific measures on the basis of criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, our purchasing work will advance by leaps and bounds. The Xinyang Special District Party Committee took the lead, established specialized agencies, convened on-site meetings, and strengthened propaganda and education work among the masses. The basic-level commercial departments also carried out inventory clearance, prepared scales, arranged funds, and organized transportation, which greatly accelerated the progress of purchasing and transportation. Their experience is worth referring to in various places.

### 坐等不得

    坐等不得
    我们的商业工作，对于处理物资缺乏的情况曾经取得了一些经验，至于在物资丰富了的情况下怎样搞好商业工作，经验还不多。今年，各地农副产品空前丰收，但是，怎样把大量的农副产品及时收购起来，调运出去，满足各方面迫切的需要，这在当前经济生活中是一个十分值得注意的问题。
    有人说，钢铁、粮食“元帅”升帐已经忙得不可开交了，再加上收购工作插进来，这个矛盾就不好解决了，不如等一等再说。我们说，收购工作是坐等不得的，必须乘着空子插进去。10月22日中央关于突击收购和调运农副产品的指示明确地指出：在当前农副产品的收购和调运工作必须发动群众，把突击收购和经常收购结合起来，突击运输和经常运输结合起来。在大搞钢铁大搞农业同时，插入收购和调运运动，大运动套小运动，长运动套短运动。许多地区的事实证明，只要认真执行中央指示精神，依靠群众，把时间、劳动力、运输力作合理的安排，收购和调运工作是无碍于“元帅”升帐的。而且农副产品采购工作本身就带有突击性，每年第四季度都是最紧张的时刻，现在不抓采购和调运，物资会造成损失还不算，更严重的后果是将要影响广大人民日常生活，影响某些工厂的正常生产，这对于支援“元帅”也是十分不利的。
    有人说，又要“元帅”升帐，又要大抓收购、调运工作，“岂不是太紧张了？”当然，在“元帅”升帐以后，呈现空前紧张的局面，这是不能否认的。但是也应该看到，这种紧张是愉快的紧张，是繁荣的紧张。我们国家建设事业许多伟大的成就都证明了，越是紧张一些，就越能促使人们开动脑筋想办法，这样，克服紧张的办法想出来了，新的工作规律摸着了，工作任务也完成了，紧张也便随着转化为轻松和愉快。所以，广大人民是喜欢这种紧张的，只有那些有严重右倾保守思想的人才骇怕紧张。其实，越怕紧张，工作就越被动，办法也就越少，工作上的包袱也就越背越重，到一定的时候就会转化为更不愉快更加紧张。
    当前的问题，还是右倾思想作怪，他们只看到紧张的一面，却看不到紧张规律性。农业和钢铁搞长运动、大运动，商业工作搞短运动和小运动，这是当前我国经济建设的客观规律，今年如此，明年仍然如此。认识这个规律，掌握这个规律，并在批判右倾保守思想的基础上，采取一些具体措施，我们的收购工作就会大踏步前进。信阳专区党委挂帅，建立专门机构，召开现场会议，加强对群众的宣传教育工作；基层商业部门并进行了清仓、准备磅秤、安排资金、组织运输等作法，大大加快了收购和调运进度，他们的经验值得各地参考。
