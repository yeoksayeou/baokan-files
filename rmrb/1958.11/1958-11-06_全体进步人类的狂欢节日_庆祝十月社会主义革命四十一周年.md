    A Carnival for All Progressive Humanity
    ——Celebrating the 41st Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution
    Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    A full forty-one years have passed since the October Socialist Revolution took place on Russian soil. Why do the working people of the world celebrate this festival with increasing warmth and enthusiasm?
    This is primarily because this revolution is far greater and of far more profound significance than any other revolution in human history. Previous revolutions, if they succeeded, replaced an old system of exploitation with a new one, a new gang of oppressors replacing the old. Through those revolutions, social productive forces were generally promoted to some extent, but exploitation and oppression still existed (and were greatly intensified in the age of imperialism), and poverty and ignorance remained. Only the October Socialist Revolution was completely different. Under the leadership of the great Lenin and the Russian Communist Party, the workers and peasants of Russia held such a great October Revolution, overthrowing all exploiting classes and smashing all systems of exploitation and oppression. From then on, a new world of genuine freedom and happiness, socialism, was born. The ideals that all the advanced elements of mankind had dreamed of and longed for for thousands of years began to be realized on one-sixth of the world's land. From then on, human history began to end its very unpleasant but profoundly instructive preface, and began to write its newest and most beautiful main text in earnest. The salvo of the October Revolution opened a new era in human history. The victory of the October Revolution and the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people in building their new life constantly encouraged the working people of the world, stirred up the endless vitality of mankind that had long been hidden underground, and spurred them to rush to the bright common road of human development that the October Revolution represented, and to fight for the construction of a new world of freedom and happiness where there is no exploitation of man by man or oppression of man by man.
    The October Revolution became a great festival for all progressive humanity because it laid a solid foundation for the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. One hundred and ten years ago, the East Wind complied with the requirements of the times, "rising from the end of the duckweed." Marx and Engels were the first to expound the world-historical mission of the proletariat as the creator of a socialist society. At that time, as Lenin said, "Marx's doctrine did not occupy a dominant position. It was only one of countless socialist factions or trends of thought." Just as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Marx and Engels were only two people, and at that time they said that capitalism around the world would be overthrown." This East Wind was fierce and furious, stirring up the heroic uprising of the Paris proletariat in 1871, thereby establishing the immortal Paris Commune; after that, it went through a long period of accumulating strength and preparing for battle, and in 1905 it ignited the uprising of Moscow workers, shaking the foundation of the Tsarist rule. But whether it was the Paris Commune or the Russian Revolution of 1905, the working class failed in the face of the resistance and suppression of the landlords and bourgeoisie. It was not until after the victory of the October Revolution in 1917 that the working class became the ruling class within the scope of a large country, the ideal of socialism became the actual life of the people, and on this basis a powerful force combining spirit and matter was formed. It was precisely by relying on this force that the Soviet people defeated the intervention of fourteen imperialist countries. It was also precisely by relying on this force that mankind was able to defeat the Axis powers of Germany, Japan and Italy (which were the vanguard of that West Wind at the time), with the Soviet army as the main force, and avoid fascist enslavement. The victory of the Soviet Union in the anti-fascist war, on the one hand, defeated three imperialist countries, and on the other hand, helped and promoted the establishment of China and a series of other socialist countries. In this way, the situation of the balance of class forces in the world and the balance of power between the East Wind and the West Wind underwent epoch-making changes. Last year, the Soviet Union launched artificial satellites, and representatives of communist and workers' parties from various countries held a meeting in Moscow and issued a declaration. These two events marked a new turning point in the world political situation. This turning point, as expressed by Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant conclusion, is: "I think the characteristic of the current situation is that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, that is to say, the socialist forces have an overwhelming advantage over the imperialist forces." From November last year to now, the development of the situation in the past year has clearly proved that the East Wind is further prevailing over the West Wind, and the socialist forces have far surpassed the imperialist forces. This new turning point, this situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, comes from a more fundamental turning point, that is, the turning point of the entire human history, namely the October Revolution forty-one years ago. Only after this October Revolution gave birth to the first socialist country like the Soviet Union, then there could be the victory of the anti-fascist war (another turning point in the balance of power between the East Wind and the West Wind), the establishment and strengthening of the socialist camp, and the situation today where the East Wind more significantly and further prevails over the West Wind. The October Socialist Revolution laid a solid foundation for the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind and the final and complete victory of socialism and communism over capitalism. The working people of the world need to fully understand this point. From the strategic point of view of the world proletariat, after the October Revolution, all revolutions truly led by the proletariat are a continuation of the great October Revolution and a component of the world proletarian socialist revolution started by the October Revolution. Therefore, they must adhere to the path of the October Revolution. At the same time, we must continue to develop and consolidate the friendly unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union with the greatest effort, and continue to develop and consolidate the friendly unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This is our sacred responsibility.
    This great festival of the October Revolution, while making all the working people revel, also makes the imperialist mad dogs and their lackeys furious. This is by no means accidental. All imperialists and reactionaries are most afraid of hearing people say that they have no strength and that they will be eliminated. But Marxists have determined from the beginning that socialism will definitely succeed capitalism, and the proletariat will definitely defeat the bourgeoisie. Comrade Mao Zedong's famous thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is encouraging hundreds of millions of people to advance bravely with confidence. And it is precisely this October Socialist Revolution that first used iron-like facts and full persuasiveness to confirm Comrade Mao Zedong's conclusion. The Russian imperialism represented by the Tsar and Kerensky was once very powerful and fierce. It bullied China and many small and weak countries. It had powerful armed forces and a complete set of state machinery. But what about the revolutionary forces at that time? During the February Revolution, the Bolshevik Party had only 40,000 people, and during the October Revolution, it only had 240,000 people. They had no money, no food, and no army. But they overthrew the Tsar in the February Revolution and overthrew Kerensky's imperialist government in the October Revolution. In this way, the working people became the masters of their own affairs and began socialist construction.
    What does this illustrate? This shows that imperialism, which is fully armed and looks very powerful, is actually a paper tiger that appears strong on the outside but is weak on the inside. They can be completely overthrown by people who have no money, no power, and are unarmed. And the power of the people, as long as there is correct leadership, is invincible. The joint military intervention of fourteen imperialist countries that occurred in the Soviet Union later, as well as the later German fascist invasion, also demonstrated the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's above-mentioned point with great persuasiveness. Then there was the victory of our Chinese revolution, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Anglo-French war of aggression against the Suez Canal, and the recent withdrawal of the United States and Britain from the Middle East, etc., all of which eloquently showed that imperialism and all reactionaries, including U.S. imperialism, are nothing but paper tigers. In today's world, the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, and it has long been the time when imperialists and reactionaries are afraid of our revolutionary people, and it should never be that revolutionary people are afraid of imperialists and reactionaries. Now, the imperialists and reactionaries are following the old path of their predecessors, the Tsar, Kerensky, Hitler, and Mussolini, and are about to go into their graves. The death knell of imperialism was sounded long ago by the October Revolution. The more ferocious the imperialists and reactionaries appear, just as the Tsar and Kerensky behaved before the February Revolution and the October Revolution, the closer they are to death. Extremes meet, and all the nooses that strangle imperialism and reactionaries are put on by the imperialists and reactionaries themselves and tightened more and more tightly with their own hands. This was the case with the Tsar and Kerensky, and it is the same with U.S. imperialism now. Whether the imperialists and all reactionaries see this point clearly or not, reactionaries are reactionaries after all, and they will eventually perish sooner or later. The sooner the revolutionary masses see this point clearly, the better, because only in this way will they have more initiative, be able to enhance their own advantages in overwhelming the enemy, and be able to lay the foundation for world lasting peace at an early date.

### 全体进步人类的狂欢节日——庆祝十月社会主义革命四十一周年

    全体进步人类的狂欢节日
    ——庆祝十月社会主义革命四十一周年
    中苏友好协会总会秘书长  钱俊瑞
    在俄罗斯土地上发生的十月社会主义革命过去已经整整四十一个年头了。为什么全世界的劳动人民越来越多地而且越来越亲切热烈地来庆祝这个节日呢？
    这首先是因为这个革命比起人类历史上其它一切的任何一次革命都要伟大得多，意义深远得多。在这以前的革命，如果它们成功了，都是以一种新的剥削制度来代替旧的剥削制度，以一个新的压迫者所搭成的班子来代替旧的压迫者的班子；经过那一些的革命，社会生产力一般地在一定程度上是被促进了，但是剥削和压迫依然存在（在帝国主义时代还大大加深了），穷困和愚昧依然存在。只有这个十月社会主义革命，情况就完全两样。在伟大的列宁和俄国共产党的领导下，俄罗斯的工人和农民举行了这样一个伟大的十月革命，把一切剥削阶级都推翻了，把一切剥削和压迫的制度砸个粉碎，从此诞生了一个真正自由幸福的社会主义的新世界。几千年来人类中一切先进分子所梦想和渴望的理想在全世界六分之一的土地上开始实现了。人类的历史从此就着手结束它那篇十分不愉快的但是充满着深刻教训的序言，正正经经地开始写起它的最新最美的正文来了。十月革命的一声炮响，开辟了人类历史的新时代。十月革命的胜利以及苏联人民在建设自己的新生活中所获得的辉煌成就，不断地鼓舞着全世界的劳动人民，并且翻腾起一切长期潜藏在地底下的人类无穷无尽的活力，奔向十月革命这条人类发展的共同的光明大道，为建设一个没有人剥削人、人压迫人的自由幸福的新世界而奋斗。
    十月革命成为全体进步人类的伟大节日，又因为它奠定了东风压倒西风的坚实的基础。在一百一十年前，东风顺应了时代的要求，“起于青萍之末”，马克思和恩格斯第一个阐明了无产阶级作为社会主义社会创造者的世界历史使命。在那时，正像列宁所说，“马克思学说并未占有统治的地位。它不过是无数社会主义派别或思潮之一而已。”也正像毛泽东同志所说，“马克思、恩格斯只有两个人，那时他们就说全世界资本主义要被打倒。”这股东风激扬熛怒，在1871年激起了英勇的巴黎无产阶级的起义，从而建立了不朽的巴黎公社；其后又经过了长时期的积聚力量，准备战斗的过程，在1905年煽起了莫斯科工人的起义，震撼了沙皇统治的基础。但是不论巴黎公社或是1905年的俄国革命，工人阶级都在地主资产阶级的抵抗和镇压前面失败了。而直到1917年的十月革命胜利之后，工人阶级才在一个大国的范围内变成了统治阶级，社会主义的理想才变成人们的实际生活，并且在这个基础上形成了一种强大无比的精神和物质相结合的力量。正是依靠这种力量，苏联人民击败了十四个帝国主义国家的干涉。也正是依靠这种力量，人类才能以苏联军队为主力，击败德日意轴心（这是当时那股西风的先锋），而免于法西斯的奴役。苏联在反法西斯战争中的胜利，一只手打垮了三个帝国主义国家，另一只手帮助和推动了中国和其它一系列社会主义国家的成立，这样，世界范围内阶级力量对比的形势，东风和西风力量对比的形势，就发生了划时代的变化。去年苏联发射了人造卫星，同时各国共产党和工人党的代表又在莫斯科举行了会议，发布了宣言，这两件事标志了世界政治形势达到了一个新的转折点。这个转折点，正如毛泽东同志英明的论断所表达的：“我认为目前形势的特点是东风压倒西风，也就是说，社会主义的力量对于帝国主义的力量占了压倒的优势。”从去年十一月到现在，这一年来形势的发展十分明白地证明了东风是在进一步地压倒西风，社会主义的力量已经远远地超过帝国主义的力量。这个新的转折点，这个东风压倒西风的形势，来自一个更带根本性质的转折点，就是说，整个人类历史的转折点，即四十一年前的十月革命。只有在这个十月革命诞生了苏联这样第一个社会主义国家之后，然后才能有反法西斯战争的胜利（这是东风西风力量对比的另一个转折点），才能有社会主义阵营的成立和壮大，也才能有今天的东风更加显著地和更进一步地压倒西风的形势。十月社会主义革命打下了东风压倒西风，社会主义共产主义最后和完全战胜资本主义的坚实基础。世界劳动人民对于这一点有充分认识之必要。从世界无产阶级的战略观点来看，在十月革命之后，一切真正由无产阶级领导的革命，都是伟大的十月革命的继续，都是从十月革命所开始的世界无产阶级社会主义革命的一个组成部分，因此，它们都必须坚持十月革命的道路。同时，我们要用最大力量继续发展和巩固中苏两国人民的友好团结，继续发展和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的友好团结。这是我们神圣的责任。
    十月革命这一个伟大节日，一面使全体劳动人民狂欢，一面又使帝国主义疯狗及其奴才们狂怒。这也决不是偶然的。一切帝国主义和反动派最害怕听人说他们没有力量，说他们要被消灭。而马克思主义者一开头就断定：社会主义一定接替资本主义，无产阶级一定战胜资产阶级。毛泽东同志的关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的著名论断正以无比的威力鼓舞着亿万人民群众满怀着信心，奋勇前进。而恰恰不是别的，正是这个十月社会主义革命，第一个用铁一般的事实，充分的说服力，证实了毛泽东同志的这个论断。沙皇和克伦斯基所代表的俄国帝国主义曾经是厉害得很，凶得很的，它欺侮过中国和许多弱小国家，它有强大的武装力量和全套国家机器。而当时的革命力量呢，二月革命时候，布尔什维克党只有四万人，十月革命时候也只二十四万人，他们一无钱，二无粮，三无军队。但是他们在二月革命中却把沙皇推翻了，在十月革命中又把克伦斯基的帝国主义政府打倒了，这样，劳动人民就当家作主了，搞起社会主义建设来了。
    这说明了什么？这说明了全副武装的看来是很强大的帝国主义，却原来是外强中干的纸老虎，他们是完全能够被无钱无势、手无寸铁的人民打倒的，而人民的力量，只要有正确的领导，那就是无敌的。以后在苏联境内发生的十四个帝国主义国家联合出兵干涉，以及后来的德国法西斯的进攻，也都以极大的说服力，论证了毛泽东同志上述论点的正确性。接着就有我们中国革命的胜利，朝鲜战争，越南战争，苏伊士运河的英法侵略战争，以及最近美英从中东的撤兵，等等，也都雄辩地说明帝国主义和一切反动派，包括美帝国主义在内，都只不过是纸老虎。当今之世，东风压倒西风，早就到了帝国主义和反动派害怕我们革命人民的时候了，而决然不应该是革命人民害怕帝国主义和反动派。现在，帝国主义和反动派，都在走着他们的前辈沙皇、克伦斯基、希特勒、墨索里尼的老路，快要钻进坟墓里去了。帝国主义的丧钟早已被十月革命打响了。帝国主义和反动派越显得凶恶，正像二月革命和十月革命以前的沙皇和克伦斯基所表现的那样，他们便越接近死亡。物极必反，一切绞杀帝国主义和反动派的绞索都是帝国主义者和反动派自己套上而且用他们自己的双手越勒越紧的。沙皇和克伦斯基是这样，现在美帝国主义也正是这样。帝国主义者和一切反动派，看清这一点也罢，看不清这一点也罢，反动派终究是反动派，他们迟早终归要灭亡的。革命的人民群众则越早看清楚这一点越好，因为只有这样，他们就越有主动权，越能增强自己压倒敌方的优势，越能早日奠定世界持久和平的基础。
