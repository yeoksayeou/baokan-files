Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 24th: Guangdong Province has reported bumper harvests of sugarcane, hemp, pond fish, and silkworm sericulture.

	The 2.2 million mu of tall and sturdy sugarcane in the province have matured and harvesting has begun. According to agricultural departments, the total sugarcane harvest is estimated at 11 million tons, an increase of 6.5 million tons over last year; the average yield per mu is 5 tons, an increase of 72% over last year. The new sugarcane areas of Hainan Island, Zhanjiang Special Zone, and Hepu Special Zone, covering 1.1 million mu, have an average yield of over 3.5 tons per mu. These areas have become new raw material bases for Guangdong's sugar industry. In Shunde County, a famous sugarcane area, the number of effective stems in its 120,000 mu of sugarcane fields has doubled compared to previous years, and the estimated yield per mu is 11 tons, an increase of 140% over last year.

	Guangdong planted a total of 300,800 mu of hemp this year, ranking second in the country. All hemp has been harvested, with a total output of more than 1.29 million dan, an average yield of 422 jin per mu, an increase of 84% over last year. Chao'an County, with its large area of high-yielding hemp, has an average yield of 1,006 jin per mu across its 10,588 mu of hemp, becoming the first "thousand-jin hemp county" in the country. In Dengta Commune, Wuchuan County, a 1.14 mu experimental plot achieved an average yield of 2,903.5 jin of hemp per mu.

	The production of pond fish in Guangdong has developed rapidly this year, with a total output estimated at 520,000 tons, an increase of 188% over last year; the yield per unit area has increased more than twofold compared to last year.

	Silkworm sericulture, which people have always thought could only increase production slightly, has also seen significant development this year. The total output of silkworm cocoons in the province will increase by 28% compared to last year; the total output of mulberry leaves is more than 6.74 million dan, an increase of 190%. High-yield records for silkworm sericulture are also constantly emerging. Xiaohang Commune in Zhongshan County has successively created high yields of 72.08 jin of cocoons per dan of mulberry leaves and 21,286 jin of mulberry leaves per mu.

	The common technical measures for increasing the production of these economic crops, like rice, are mainly "density" (except for silkworm cocoons): dense planting of sugarcane, hemp, and mulberry trees, and dense stocking of pond fish. In the past, sugarcane was generally planted at about 1,000 plants per mu, but this year it is planted at 1,800 to 2,000 plants per mu; hemp had an average of 12,000 seedlings per mu last year, but this year it has 20,000 seedlings; pond fish had an average of 600 fish fry stocked per mu last year, but this year they are densely stocked at over 5,000. In addition to dense planting, mulberry trees are also topped and trimmed to promote more branches and abundant leaves.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, November 24th: Guiding County, Guizhou Province, which is rich in cured tobacco, has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of the 25,000 mu of cured tobacco planted this year. Currently, 90% of the tobacco leaves in the county have been cured, with a total harvest of 9 million jin of dried tobacco, doubling the total output compared to last year; the average yield per mu can reach 400 jin, an increase of 160% over last year.

	Guiding County has a history of more than 20 years of cultivating cured tobacco, and income from cured tobacco accounts for about half of the county's total agricultural and sideline income. This year, Guiding County strengthened its leadership over cured tobacco production based on its local production characteristics. Tobacco production headquarters and work groups were established at all levels from the county to the commune, and more than 300 specialized tobacco production farms and specialized tobacco production teams and groups were established in the communes. In this way, the eight-point "constitution" for agricultural production has been better implemented in cured tobacco production. One-third of the cured tobacco land in the county was deeply ploughed to more than one chi, and the remaining tobacco land was also deeply ploughed to more than eight cun. In terms of dense planting, an average of 4,200 tobacco seedlings were planted per mu, of which 15% of the area was planted with more than 7,500 seedlings per mu. All cured tobacco land was fertilized with an average of more than 15,000 jin of base fertilizer, and layered fertilization was promoted; many tobacco fields were also fumigated with soil.

    广东甘蔗黄麻塘鱼蚕桑丰收
    贵州贵定县烤烟比去年增产一倍
    新华社广州24日电　广东省的甘蔗、黄麻、塘鱼、蚕桑等都告丰收。
    全省二百二十万亩长得高大粗壮的甘蔗已经成熟，并开始收割了。据农业部门估计，共可收甘蔗一千一百万吨，比去年增长六百五十万吨；平均每亩产量五吨，比去年增产72％。今年开辟的新蔗区——海南岛和湛江专区、合浦专区的一百一十万亩甘蔗，平均每亩产量也在三吨半以上。这些地区已成为广东制糖工业新的原料基地。著名蔗区顺德县的十二万亩蔗田，有效茎比往年增长一倍，预计亩产量可达十一吨，较去年增产一点四倍。
    广东今年黄麻种植面积共三十万零八千亩，居全国第二位。目前已全部收割完毕，总产量一百二十九万多担，平均亩产四百二十二斤，比去年增产84％。大面积高产的潮安县，全县一万零五百八十八亩黄麻平均亩产一千零六斤，成为全国第一个黄麻千斤县。吴川县灯塔公社有一亩一分四厘试验田，平均亩产黄麻高达二千九百零三点五斤。
    今年广东塘鱼生产的发展很快，总产量预计可达五十二万吨，比去年增长一点八八倍；单位面积产量较去年增产两倍多。
    人们向来认为只能少量地增产的蚕桑，今年也有较大的发展。全县蚕茧总产量将比去年增产28％；桑叶总产量六百七十四万多担，增产一点九倍。蚕桑高产纪录也不断出现。中山县小杭公社先后创造了一担桑产茧七十二点零八斤和亩产桑叶二万一千二百八十六斤的高额丰产。
    这些经济作物获得增产的共同技术措施，和水稻一样主要是“密”（蚕茧除外），甘蔗、黄麻、桑树密植、塘鱼密养。甘蔗往年一般每亩种一千株左右，今年种一千八百至二千株；黄麻去年平均每亩一万二千苗，今年二万苗；塘鱼去年平均每亩放养鱼种六百条，今年密养到五千条以上；桑树除了密植之外，还摘芯、摘梢，使桑枝多发，叶片繁生。
    新华社贵阳24日电　盛产烤烟的贵州省贵定县，今年栽种的二万五千亩烤烟获得大面积丰收。目前全县90％的烟叶已烘烤完毕，共收干烟九百万斤，总产量比去年增加一倍；平均亩产可达四百斤，比去年增产一点六倍。
    贵定县已有二十多年栽培烤烟的历史，烤烟收入占全县农副业总收入的一半左右。今年贵定县根据本地生产特点，加强了对烤烟生产的领导，从县到社层层建立了烤烟生产指挥部、工作组等机构，各公社建立的烤烟专业生产农场和烤烟专业生产队、组就有三百多个。这样，在烤烟生产中，就比较好地执行了农业生产八条“宪法”。全县三分之一的烤烟地深耕一尺以上，其余的烟地也都深耕八寸多。在密植方面，平均每亩栽烟苗四千二百株，其中有15％的面积每亩栽七千五百株以上。所有烤烟地平均施底肥一万五千多斤，并推行了分层施肥法；还有不少烟地进行了熏土。
