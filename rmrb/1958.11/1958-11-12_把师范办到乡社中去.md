	Run Teachers' Colleges in Townships and Communes

The entire Party and the entire people are vigorously developing education. Many places have already popularized secondary and primary education, and teachers are needed everywhere. The existing teaching staff, both in terms of quantity and quality, cannot meet the needs of actual work. Therefore, vigorously developing teacher education has been put on our work agenda.

Is it necessary to run teacher education? No one doubts this; it must be done. However, can teacher education be run at the grassroots level? Many people hold skeptical views.

Formalists say that teacher training schools should look like teacher training schools, and "pedagogy" must be taught in class. Our attitude is the opposite of theirs. The bourgeoisie's pedagogy is completely wrong. New pedagogy is waiting for us to find the correct answer from practice and from real life, based on Marx's educational thought and in accordance with the Party's educational policies and guidelines. In Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, the amateur teachers' college broke with superstition and adopted the method of "teach what you learn," learning for practical application, which has achieved good results. This has broken the bourgeois educational thought of "education for education's sake." This is breaking with the bourgeoisie's formalism and establishing the proletariat's formalism on the educational front.

Those who focus on conditions say that there are no conditions for running teacher training at the grassroots level. Isn't it just "stir-frying radish with radish," unable to teach anything systematic? But we believe that conditions are created by people. The problem lies in observing and excavating among the masses. Because our cause is the cause of the people, the cause of the masses, as long as we truly connect with the masses, the masses will provide us with extremely rich conditions or create conditions. Conversely, if we are divorced from the masses, even the best conditions will be useless. In Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, the teachers' colleges run by the communes follow the principle of "the capable shall be teachers" to invite teachers, and adopt the method of taking turns as teachers to exchange experience to solve problems encountered in teaching practice, improve themselves, and help others. Following the mass line, teaching and learning from each other can greatly solve the teacher problem. Townships and communes running teachers' colleges do not lack conditions, but have many conditions.

There are also some short-sighted people who believe that teacher education should be run, but it is not their business, but the business of the higher-level Party and government, and the commune cannot manage so much. Indeed, running teacher training at the grassroots level is an innovation, a major revolution, something that has never happened before. Our country is building socialism and preparing conditions for the transition to communism. This means that state functionaries should learn to be versatile. People have already seen the relationship between production and education, and the importance of teachers to education, so they must dare to think and act, liberate their minds, break with superstition, follow the mass line, and put teacher education on the work agenda.

School education can break with superstition and blossom everywhere; teacher education will certainly be able to break with superstition and blossom everywhere. Everyone should not wait and see, hesitate, and hurry up to start running teacher education!

### 把师范办到乡社中去

    把师范办到乡社中去
    全党全民正在大办教育，许多地方已经普及了中学教育和小学教育，到处需要师资。现有的师资从数量到质量都不能满足实际工作的需要，所以，大办师范教育就提到我们的工作日程上来了。
    要不要办师范教育？这是没有人怀疑的，一定要办。可是，对于基层能不能办师范教育？持怀疑观点的却大有人在。
    正规论者说，师范学校要像个师范学校的样子，上课一定要讲“教育学”。我们所持的态度却与他们相反。资产阶级的教育学根本不对头。新的教育学正有待我们根据马克思的教育思想按照党的教育方针政策，从实际出发，到现实生活中去寻求正确的答案。四川省叙永县办业余师范中，打破迷信，采取了“教什么，学什么”的办法，学以致用，收效良好。这就破除了“为教育而教育”的资产阶级教育思想。这是教育战线上的破资产阶级的正规，立无产阶级正规。
    条件论者说，基层办师范没有什么条件，还不是“萝卜炒萝卜”，教不出什么章法来。可是我们认为，条件是人创造的。问题在于到群众中去观察和挖掘。由于我们的事业是人民的事业，是群众的事业，只要我们真正地联系了群众，群众一定会提供给我们极其丰富的条件或者创造出条件来。相反地，如果脱离了群众，即使具有再好的条件也没有用场。江苏省昆山县社社办师范中，按照“能者为师”的原则来请教师，采取轮流担任教师的办法交流经验，来解决教学实践中碰到的问题，提高了自己，帮助了别人。走群众路线，互教互学，就可以大大解决教师问题。乡社办师范不是没有条件，而是条件很多。
    还有一种目光短浅的人，他们认为，师范教育是要办的，可是不是他们的事，而是上级党和政府的事，社里管不了这么多。的确，基层办师范是个创举，是个大革命，是过去没有过的。我国正在建设社会主义，并且为过渡到共产主义准备条件。这就是说，国家工作人员应当学作多面手。人们已经看到了生产和教育的关系，看到师资对于教育的重要意义，那就要敢想敢作，解放思想，破除迷信，走群众路线，把师范教育安排到工作日程上去。
    学校教育能够破除迷信，遍地开花；师范教育也一定能够破除迷信，遍地开花。大家不要观望、徘徊，赶快动手把师范教育办起来！
