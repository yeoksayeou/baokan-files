    Education and science are flourishing
    Shedding the Hat of Cultural Backwardness
    Gansu Province's education has experienced unprecedented prosperity. According to recent statistics, 88.31% of the province's young and middle-aged adults have shaken off illiteracy, basically achieving a province free of illiteracy among young and middle-aged adults; 97.36% of school-age children in the province are enrolled in school, and secondary schools have grown to 794, with more than 130,000 students, an average of 10.24% middle school students per thousand people; the number of universities and colleges has increased by 39 compared to last year, with more than 14,000 students. Spare-time education is even more vibrant and colorful, not only popularizing spare-time elementary schools, but also creating all kinds of spare-time middle schools, and establishing 219 red-and-expert universities of various types.

    The Masses Vigorously Run Scientific Undertakings
    A mass scientific research atmosphere is taking shape in Gansu Province. According to incomplete statistics, more than 4,000 folk-run scientific research institutes, research offices, and science and technology associations have been established in various parts of the province, along with 19,000 technical classes and 27,500 technical groups.
    The scientific research institutions established by the masses are mainly run by counties, townships, and communes themselves, and are mostly led by the Party committee secretary who directly participates in research and assumes leadership. Although these institutions do not have modern equipment and instruments, they still carry out research work and have made great achievements. Farmers in Kangle County have successfully used snuff instead of 666 powder to kill wheat sucking midges in their pest control research. They sprayed it on more than 220 mu of wheat fields infested with wheat sucking midges, using three and a half jin per mu. The result was a 100% kill rate, even stronger than 666 powder. (Sun Jing)
    Farmers Learn to Use Isotopes
    Farmers began learning about the application of radioactive isotopes in agriculture on October 20 in Lanzhou, marking the first time that working people across the country have used atomic energy for peaceful purposes.
    The "Isotope Application Training Class" is being run by the Northwest Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. More than 20 people are participating in the training. They will spend seven weeks learning the basic knowledge of material structure and radiochemistry, learn to use basic instruments and simple isotope application methods, and personally conduct some isotope application experiments in agriculture. The learning method is mainly a combination of theory and practice, with four hours of lectures and six hours of review each day. (Sun Jing)

    教育科学事业欣欣向荣
    摘掉文化落后帽子
    甘肃省教育事业出现了前所未有的繁荣景象。据最近统计，全省已有88.31％的青壮年摘掉了文盲帽子，基本上实现了青壮年无盲省；全省97.36％的学龄儿童已入学，中等学校已发展到七百九十四所，学生十三万余人，平均每千人中有中学生10.24％；高等学校比去年增加了三十九所，学生已达到一万四千余人。业余教育更是百花齐放，万紫千红，不仅普及了业余高小，而且还创了各种各样的业余中学，创办了各类红专大学二百一十九所。

    群众大办科学事业
    一个群众性的科学研究风气正在甘肃省形成中。据不完全统计。现在全省各地建立起来的民办科学研究所，研究室及科学技术协会等共四千多个，技术班一万九千个，技术小组二万七千五百个。
    群众建立的科学研究机构，主要是县、乡，社自己办的，大都由党委书记直接参加研究并担任领导工作。这些机构虽没有现代化的设备和仪器。却照样进行研究工作，而且做出很大成绩。康乐县农民在研究虫害中，试用鼻烟代替六六六药粉杀灭小麦吸浆虫已经成功。他们在二百二十多亩发生小麦吸浆虫的麦田里进行喷撒，每亩撒了三斤半。结果杀虫效率达到百分之百，比六六六药粉还强。　（孙　晶）
    农民学用同位素
    农民学习放射性同位素在农业上的应用，10月20日在兰州开始，这是全国第一批劳动人民把原子能用于和平事业。
    “同位素应用训练班”是中国科学院西北分院开办的。参加学习的二十余人。他们要在七个星期的时间内，学完物质结构和放射化学的基本常识，学会使用基本仪器和简便的同位素应用方法，并亲自做出某些同位素应用在农业上的试验。学习的方法主要是理论和实际相结合，每天讲课四小时，复习六小时。（孙晶）
