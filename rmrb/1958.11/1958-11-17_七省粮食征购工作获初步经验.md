Preliminary Experience Gained in Grain Procurement Work in Seven Provinces
Based on the spirit of "giving way, assisting, squeezing," unified arrangements for labor and time to launch a mass movement, phased blitzes, seizing every opportunity, and setting off a high tide of urban-rural cooperation, collaboration between financial and trade departments, and cooperation between communes.

From the 6th to the 11th, the average daily grain storage volume across the country has exceeded 2 billion jin, approaching 2.1 billion jin, which is 1.8 times higher than the highest record of the average daily storage volume in the past five years.

The main force behind this achievement is the seven provinces of Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Anhui, Hebei, Shandong, and Hubei, which participated in the first high tide of national grain procurement. Due to the correct implementation of the emergency instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on the task of rushing to complete the procurement and transfer of agricultural products, and the large-scale mass movement, the scale and momentum of this procurement high tide were unprecedented. A few days ago, Henan Province took the lead in overfulfilling the grain procurement task (excluding potatoes) fifty days ahead of schedule. Heilongjiang Province caught up later, and on the 15th, it overfulfilled the annual grain procurement task by 3.5%. At the National Grain Telephone Conference held today, Chen Guodong, Vice Minister of Food, praised these advanced provinces and summarized the preliminary experience of the above seven provinces in organizing the procurement high tide. He analyzed the new situation and new characteristics of this procurement movement, and emphasized some common practices adopted by the seven provinces under this new situation: First, strengthen the leadership of the Party, based on the spirit of giving way (to the steel and grain marshals), assisting (in supporting the marshals' advancement), and squeezing (finding gaps to squeeze time and labor to rush grain procurement), unified arrangements for labor and time. If arrangements are well made, the movement will come quickly. Second, launch a large-scale mass movement, adopting the method of large-scale movements encompassing small-scale movements, implementing phased blitzes, and setting off a high tide. Within a province, several high tides are also launched. This is a concrete way to seize every opportunity. Third, organize three collaborations: first, urban-rural cooperation, with workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers cooperating to send grain to warehouses; second, collaboration between financial and trade departments in procurement, adopting the method of "handling everything when going to the countryside, and then dividing the work after returning" for agricultural product procurement; third, cooperation between communes, providing mutual support.

Chen Guodong urged all regions to make persistent efforts to launch a greater procurement high tide and pay special attention to making grain procurement work more solid. Attention should be paid to the quality and storage of grain entering the commune warehouses, and where conditions permit, grain from the state, local authorities, and communes should be stored separately. The moisture content of the grain entering the warehouse should meet safety standards to effectively improve the quality of the grain entering the warehouse. In concentrated potato production areas, we must also do a good job in the storage, supply, and comprehensive utilization of potatoes. In addition, we must also do a good job in grain transfer work.

    全国粮食入仓量创历年最高纪录
    七省粮食征购工作获初步经验
    本着“让、援、挤”的精神，统一安排劳力和时间大搞群众运动，分期突击，见缝插针，掀起高潮组织城乡协作、财贸部门协作和公社与公社协作
    新华社16日讯　从6日到11日，全国征购粮食的平均日入仓量已突破二十亿斤，逼近二十一亿斤，比历年全国五日平均日入仓量的最高纪录高出一点八倍。
    赢得这个成绩的主力，是参与全国粮食征购第一个高潮的黑龙江、河南、湖南、安徽、河北、山东、湖北等七省。各地由于正确贯彻了中共中央、国务院关于突击完成农产品收购调运任务的紧急指示，大搞群众运动，这次征购高潮规模之大来势之猛都属空前。前几天，河南省一马当先提前五十天超额完成了除薯类以外的粮食征购任务；黑龙江省后来居上，已在15日超额3.5％完成了全年全部粮食征购任务。在今天举行的全国粮食电话会议上，粮食部副部长陈国栋表扬了这些先进省份，并对上述七省组织征购高潮的初步经验作了小结。他分析了这次征购运动的新形势、新特点，着重指出七省在这种新情况下所采取的一些共同作法：一、加强党的领导，本着让（给钢粮元帅让路）、援（支援元帅升帐）、挤（找空隙挤时间挤劳力突击征购）的精神，统一安排劳力、时间，安排得好，运动就来得快。二、大搞群众运动，采取大运动套小运动的作法，分批分期突击，掀起高潮。一省之内，也是搞几个高潮。这是见缝扎针的具体作法。三、组织三个协作：一是城乡协作，工农商学兵协作送粮入库；二是财贸部门协作征购，采取“下乡一把抓，回来再分家”的办法收购农产品；三是公社与公社协作，互相支援。
    陈国栋要求各地再接再厉，掀起更大的征购高潮，并且要特别注意把粮食征购工作搞得更加踏实。就社入库的粮食要注意粮质和保管，有条件的地方要把国家、地方和公社的粮食分仓保管。入库粮食的水分要达到安全标准，切实提高入库粮食的质量。在薯类集中产区还要切实作好薯类的保管、供应和综合利用。此外，还要作好粮食调运工作。
