    Xi'an Street Industries Process for Large Factories
    Large Factories Find Powerful Assistants, Small Factories Achieve Consolidated Development

    (Reported by our correspondent Li Qian) Xi'an City is organizing street-level small industries and school-run industries to process for large and medium-sized factories. This can not only solve the problem of labor shortages in large industries but also improve the technical level of small factories and solve problems such as the lack of raw materials for small factories.

    Since the Great Leap Forward, the tasks of large and medium-sized industries in the Xi'an area have increased significantly, especially the machinery manufacturing industry, where tasks have generally increased several times compared to last year. Therefore, there is a widespread feeling of insufficient labor. On the other hand, Xi'an City has already established more than 4,600 street cooperative factories with a total of more than 40,000 employees. Major universities and middle schools have also established 5,000 small factories. In the previous period of development, these small industries had a certain degree of blindness. In order to guide the development of street-level small factories in the right direction, give full play to their role, and avoid conflicts with large and medium-sized industries such as steel and machinery in terms of raw materials, equipment, and labor, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to organize street industries and school-run small industries to process for large factories, or allow small industries to undertake general repair tasks. In this way, large, medium, and small industries can cooperate with each other and improve together.

    Recently, many large and medium-sized factories have divided some simple and mainly manual operations into sections and processes and handed them over to small factories run by nearby streets and schools for production. Large factories free up manpower, factory buildings, and equipment to engage in the production of large and precision products, expanding the factory's production capacity. For example, the Northwest Automotive Tool Repair Factory began to undertake the production of equipment such as machine tools, portable boilers, converters, and cupola furnaces this year. Because the number of workers has basically not increased, the labor force is very tight. In order to complete such arduous production tasks on schedule, this factory signed processing contracts with small factories run by the Red Star Machinery Factory, the Third Metal Cooperative, the Fourth Metal Cooperative, and the Thirty-eighth Middle School, the Third Middle School, the Twenty-ninth Middle School, etc., entrusting these small factories to process some small castings, forgings, screws, and some simple parts. This factory then freed up skilled workers to produce large castings of 50 kilograms or more and more precise mechanical processing parts, which basically changed the past situation of excessively heavy production tasks and tight labor.

    In order to ensure that the product quality of each small factory is qualified, large factories have implemented the method of masters leading apprentices to quickly improve the technical level of workers in small factories, and support them with some simpler equipment. The Northwest Automotive Tool Repair Factory has adopted the method of absorbing workers and middle school students from small factories to the factory for internships, or sending production teams to produce at small factories with the factory's production tasks, teaching the technology to the workers of small factories. Therefore, the product quality of small factories generally meets the requirements. As the technical level of workers in small factories continues to improve, the scope of accepted production tasks is becoming wider and wider, and the quantity is also increasing.

    Street industries processing for large and medium-sized factories also has many benefits for themselves. First of all, it is conducive to the consolidation and development of street industries. Before street industries processed for large industries, the problem of raw materials and sales was quite large; after processing for large industries, the supply and sales problems were basically solved. Second, it can gradually bring thousands of street-run industries into the planned orbit. Third, after the street laborers have been trained through processing, they can become a reserve labor force for large factories. After the technical level and mechanization degree of a small number of small factories are improved, they can also be upgraded.

    西安街道工业为大厂加工
    大厂找到有力助手　小厂得到巩固发展
    本报讯　记者李茜报道：西安市组织街道小型工业和学校工业为大、中型工厂加工，既可以解决大型工业劳动力紧张的问题，又可以提高小型工厂的技术水平，解决小厂缺乏原材料等问题。
    大跃进以来，西安地区的大、中型工业任务增加都很多，尤其是机械制造工业，任务一般都比去年增加数倍，因此普遍感到劳动力不足。另一方面，西安市已经办起四千六百多个街道合作工厂，共有四万多名职工。各大、中学校也办起了五千个小型工厂。这些小型工业在前一个时期的发展中曾经有一定的盲目性。中共西安市委为了引导街道小型工厂向正确方向发展，充分发挥它们的作用，避免在原料、设备、劳动力等方面同钢铁、机械等大、中型工业发生矛盾，决定组织街道工业和学校小型工业为大厂加工，或者让小型工业承担一般的修理任务。这样，就可以使大、中、小型工业互相协作，共同提高。
    最近，很多大、中型工厂已经把一些简单的和主要用手工操作的工种和工序划分出来，交给附近街道和学校办的小型工厂进行生产。大工厂腾出人力、厂房、设备，便去搞大型和精密产品的生产，扩大工厂的生产能力。例如，西北汽车机具修配厂今年开始担任机床、锅驼机、转炉、冲天炉等设备的生产任务。由于工人基本上没有增加，劳动力十分紧张。为了按期完成这样繁重的生产任务，这个厂和红星机械厂、第三金属合作社、第四金属合作社以及第三十八中、三中、二十九中等学校办的小型工厂订立了加工合同，将一些小型的铸件、锻件、螺丝钉及一些简单的零件委托这些小厂加工。这个厂便腾出技术工人生产五十公斤以上的大型铸件和较精密的机械加工件等，基本上改变了过去生产任务过于繁重和劳动力紧张的现象。
    为了保证各小厂加工的产品质量合格，大型工厂都实行了师傅带徒弟的办法，迅速提高小厂职工的技术水平，并且支援他们一些较简单的设备。西北汽车机具修配厂采取了吸收小厂工人和中学生到厂实习，或派生产组带着本厂的生产任务到小厂去生产的方法，将技术教给小厂的工人。因此，小厂加工的产品质量一般都能达到要求。由于小厂工人技术水平不断提高，接受生产任务的范围也愈来愈广，数量也愈来愈多。
    街道工业为大、中型工厂加工，对它们本身也有很多好处。首先是有利于街道工业的巩固和发展。街道工业在没有为大型工业加工以前，原料和销路问题相当大；给大型工业加工以后，供销问题就基本解决了。第二，可以逐步地把千万个街巷民办工业纳入计划轨道。第三，街巷劳动者经过加工的锻炼，可以成为大厂的劳动后备军。少数小厂技术水平和机械程度提高以后，还可以升级。
