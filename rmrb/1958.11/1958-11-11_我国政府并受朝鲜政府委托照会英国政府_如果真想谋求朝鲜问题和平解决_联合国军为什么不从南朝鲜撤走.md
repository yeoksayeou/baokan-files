Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs today delivered a note to the British Office, requesting the British government to forward it to the governments of all countries participating in the United Nations Forces. This note is the reply of the Chinese government and the Chinese government, entrusted by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to the note from the British government representing the United Nations Forces of July 2nd. The full text of the note is as follows:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China extends its greetings to the British Office in China. Please notify the British government of the following matters and, through the British government, forward them to the governments of all countries on the United Nations Forces side.

The Chinese government, in its own name and entrusted by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, replies to the sixty-fourth note from the British government representing the governments of all countries on the United Nations Forces side, which was sent to the Chinese government on July 2, 1958, as follows:

The Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from Korea. This proactive measure by the Korean-Chinese side has broken the deadlock in the Korean issue and provided favorable conditions for a peaceful resolution. If the United Nations Forces side can take corresponding measures and also withdraw their troops from Korea, then the prospect of a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue will undoubtedly be greatly improved. However, the governments of Korea and China cannot help but point out with regret that the United Nations Forces side has not only failed to take any corresponding measures to date but has also continuously violated the Armistice Agreement by illegally shipping new weapons into Korea and establishing missile bases in southern Korea. These facts once again vividly illustrate who wants peace, who is aggressing, who is seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, and who is obstructing a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. Anyone cannot help but ask, if the United Nations Forces side is confident that their position is in line with the interests of the Korean people, then why don't they withdraw from South Korea and let the Korean people solve their own problems without any external interference?

The note mentions the issue of elections, to which the Korean government, in its statement of February 5, 1958, has already made a clear statement: After all foreign troops have withdrawn from North and South Korea, free elections should be held throughout Korea within a certain period, and the elections can be conducted under the supervision of a neutral country's organization. If the governments of all countries participating in the United Nations Forces truly have the desire to achieve a "unified, independent, and democratic Korea" by peaceful means, then after the troops of the United States and other countries participating in the United Nations Forces have completely withdrawn from Korea, the specific issues related to elections are not difficult to resolve reasonably through further consultations between the relevant countries. However, it is difficult for the two notes from the United Nations Forces side to convince people that they have such a desire. The United Nations Forces side has repeatedly insisted on resolving the Korean issue under the unilateral conditions of the United Nations. However, everyone knows that under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations has been placed in the position of a belligerent in the Korean War and has completely lost the qualifications and moral authority to handle the Korean issue fairly and reasonably. If the United Nations Forces cannot impose the unilateral conditions of the United Nations for resolving the Korean issue on the Korean people by means of war, then what other explanation can there be for insisting on these conditions now, except to deliberately obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and maintain and exacerbate the tension in Korea and the Far East?

The governments of Korea and China believe that the continued presence of the troops of the United States and other countries participating in the United Nations Forces in southern Korea is the main obstacle to seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue at present. As long as they do not withdraw from Korea, they cannot escape the opposition and condemnation of the Korean people who yearn for peaceful reunification and the people of all peace-loving countries in the world. The governments of Korea and China hope that the governments of all countries on the United Nations Forces side will reconsider their rigid position and take positive measures that conform to the national aspirations of the Korean people and the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world.

Respectfully to the British Office in China.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
November 10, 1958, Beijing

Attachment: Note from the British Government Representing the Governments of All Countries on the United Nations Forces Side, July 2nd.

The British Office extends its greetings to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China and, on behalf of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, respectfully replies to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note of May 6, 1958, which has been forwarded to the governments of all countries that have provided troops to the United Nations Forces in Korea. These governments, after consultation, have requested Her Majesty's Government to once again represent them in making a reply.

The relevant governments point out that the majority of the troops sent to Korea in accordance with the United Nations resolution have already been withdrawn, and reiterate their welcome to the statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China that Chinese troops will also be withdrawn from North Korea.

However, the relevant governments are disappointed that the note delivered to the British Office on May 6 did not provide the clarification requested in the note delivered by the British Office on April 9, and brushed aside the issue of the principles on which elections should be based. The relevant governments believe that the principles listed in the April 9 note are the central issue in this matter. It is for this reason that they requested clarification in the aforementioned British Office's note. They cannot agree that further withdrawal of United Nations troops, without any provisions for a proper settlement of the Korean issue, would be aimed at leading to the easing of tensions in the Far East; they even believe that such an action would cancel a guarantee that currently exists, which is essential to prevent new aggression in Korea before a final settlement is reached.

The relevant governments hope to see a genuine solution to the Korean issue in accordance with United Nations resolutions and are always willing to promote consideration of measures aimed at achieving reunification on this basis. United Nations troops are staying in Korea under the mandate of the United Nations. In accordance with the existing recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly, the relevant governments are prepared to withdraw their troops from Korea when the conditions for a lasting solution stipulated by the General Assembly are realized.

A copy of this reply is being sent to the United Nations.

The British Office takes this opportunity to renew to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China the assurances of its highest consideration.

British Office
July 2, 1958

### 我国政府并受朝鲜政府委托照会英国政府  如果真想谋求朝鲜问题和平解决  联合国军为什么不从南朝鲜撤走

    我国政府并受朝鲜政府委托照会英国政府
    如果真想谋求朝鲜问题和平解决  联合国军为什么不从南朝鲜撤走
    新华社10日讯  我外交部今日交给英国代办处照会一份，并且要求英国政府转达参加联合国军的各国政府。这份照会是中国政府和中国政府受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，对英国政府代表联合国军方面各国政府7月2日来照的答复。照会全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部向英国驻华代办处致意。请将下列事项通知英国政府，并通过英国政府转达联合国军方面各国政府。
    中国政府以自己的名义，并且受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，对英国政府代表联合国军方面各国政府在1958年7月2日发致中国政府的第六十四号照会答复如下：
    中国人民志愿军已经全部从朝鲜撤出。朝中方面的这一主动措施，打开了朝鲜问题的僵局，为和平解决朝鲜问题提供了有利的条件。如果联合国军方面能够采取相应的措施，也从朝鲜撤出他们的军队，那么，和平解决朝鲜问题的前景无疑将得到极大的改善。但是，朝中两国政府不能不遗憾地指出，联合国军方面不仅迄未采取任何相应措施，而且还不断违反停战协定，非法向朝鲜运进新式武器，并且在朝鲜南部建立导弹基地。这些事实，再一次生动地说明了究竟是谁要和平，谁在侵略，谁在谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，谁在阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。任何人都不免要问，如果联合国军方面自信他们的立场是符合朝鲜人民的利益的，那么，他们为什么不撤出南朝鲜，让朝鲜人民在没有任何外力干涉的情况下自己解决自己的问题呢？
    来照中提出有关选举的问题，对此，朝鲜政府在它的1958年2月5日的声明中，已经作了明确的表示：在一切外国军队撤出南北朝鲜以后，应该在一定时期内实行全朝鲜的自由选举，选举可以在中立国机构监督下进行。如果参加联合国军的各国政府确实具有用和平方法实现一个“统一、独立和民主的朝鲜”的愿望，那么，在美国和参加联合国军的其他国家的军队全部撤出朝鲜以后，有关选举方面的具体问题，是不难由有关国家经过进一步协商求得合理解决的。但是，联合国军方面的两次照会很难使人相信他们具有这样的愿望。联合国军方面一再坚持在联合国的片面条件下解决朝鲜问题。但是，谁都知道，在美国操纵下，联合国已经被置于朝鲜战争中交战一方的地位，根本失去了公平合理处理朝鲜问题的资格和道义力量。如果联合国军用战争的方法也不能把联合国解决朝鲜问题的片面条件强加在朝鲜人民的身上，那么，现在坚持这些条件，除非是蓄意阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决、保持和加剧朝鲜和远东的紧张局势，还可能有什么别的解释呢？
    朝中两国政府认为，美国和参加联合国军的其他国家的军队继续留在朝鲜南部，是目前谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的主要障碍。他们一天不从朝鲜撤走，就一天不能逃脱渴望和平统一的朝鲜人民和爱好和平的世界各国人民的反对和谴责。朝中两国政府希望联合国军方面各国政府重行考虑他们的僵硬立场，并且采取符合于朝鲜人民的民族愿望和世界人民的和平愿望的积极措施。
          此致英国驻华代办处
                        中华人民共和国外交部
                          1958年11月10日于北京
      附件：英国政府代表联合国军方面
            各国政府七月二日的来照
    英国代办处向中华人民共和国外交部致意并奉女王外交大臣之命谨答复外交部1958年5月6日来照，该照会已经转达为在朝鲜的联合国军队提供过部队的各国政府，这些政府在谘商后要求女王陛下政府再次代表它们提出答复。
    有关各国政府指出，按照联合国决议派到朝鲜去的军队，大部分已经撤出，同时重申欢迎中华人民共和国政府关于中国部队也将从北朝鲜撤出的声明。
    然而有关各国政府感到失望，5月6日交给英国代办的照会并没有提供4月9日英国代办交去的照会中所要求的澄清，并且把举行选举所应该依据的原则的问题撇在了一边。有关各国政府认为4月9日照会中所列举的各项原则是这件事的中心问题。正是因为这个缘故，它们在上述英国代办的照会中请求加以澄清。它们不能同意，在没有为朝鲜问题的正当解决作出任何规定的条件下，进一步撤退联合国军队会是旨在导致远东紧张局势的和缓的；它们甚至认为这样的行动会取消目前存在的，在没有实现最后解决以前防止在朝鲜发生新的侵略所必不可少的一个保障。
    有关各国政府希望看到朝鲜问题按照联合国决议得到真正的解决，并且随时愿意促进考虑旨在这个基础上实现重新统一的措施。联合国军队是遵联合国之命呆在朝鲜的。按照联合国大会现有的建议案，有关各国政府准备在大会所规定的持久解决的条件获得实现的时候从朝鲜撤走它们的军队。
    这个答复的副本正送交联合国中。
    英国代办处顺向中华人民共和国外交部重申最崇高的敬意。
                                    英国代办处
                                1958年7月2日
