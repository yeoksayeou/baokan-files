North Korea Advances Vigorously

    Build Cement Factories in a Big Way; Build More New Residences
    (By our dispatch) In various parts of northern Korea, in order to effectively utilize the abundant cement raw materials, simple cement factories are being built on a large scale.
    In South Pyongan Province, which has the richest cement raw materials, it is planned to build twenty-five cement factories this year. The construction speed is currently being accelerated. Among them, the cement factories built in Sunchon County and Sungho County have already been put into production, with a daily output of several tons. When all twenty-five cement factories are put into production, their annual output will reach 100,000 to 130,000 tons. In this way, South Pyongan Province will be completely self-sufficient in the cement needed for the construction of 50,000 rural cultural residences next year.
    The cement factory built in Pongsan County, North Hwanghae Province, was completed in mid-September and produces four to five tons of cement per day to supply the needs of irrigation construction sites. The filling and mixing operations of this factory are mechanized.
    Currently, the cement factories being built on a large scale throughout the country are expected to produce 1.2 million tons of cement by 1959, in addition to the state plan.

    大办水泥厂　多建新住宅
    本报讯　在朝鲜北部各地，为了有效地利用丰富的水泥原料，正在大力兴建着简便的水泥厂。
    水泥原料最丰富的平安南道，预计在今年内建设二十五所水泥厂。目前正在加快其建设速度，其中建设在顺天郡和胜湖郡的水泥厂，已经投入生产了，其日产量达数吨。二十五所水泥厂全部投入生产以后，其年产量将达到十万吨到十三万吨。这样，平安南道在明年建设五万幢农村文化住宅所需的水泥，将可完全自给自足。
    在黄海北道凤山郡建立的水泥厂，已在9月中旬竣工，每天生产四——五吨水泥来供应灌溉工地的需要。这个厂的填料和搅拌作业，都是机械化的。
    目前，全国各地正在大规模地兴建的水泥厂，预计到1959年，除了国家计划以外将生产一百二十万吨水泥。
