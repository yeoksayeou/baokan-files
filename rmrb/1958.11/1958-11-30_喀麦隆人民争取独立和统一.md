The people oppressed and enslaved on the African continent are experiencing surging movements demanding independence, and the chains of colonialism are collapsing section by section. The fact that the British and French governments were forced to agree to Cameroon gaining unification and independence in 1960 is an example of this general trend.

	Pirate Invasions and Plunder

The history of Cameroon is one filled with blood, tears, and arduous struggle. At the end of the fifteenth century, Portuguese, Dutch, and British pirates successively invaded Cameroon to trade black people and plunder ivory. In 1884, German colonialists invaded and occupied Cameroon. During World War I, British and French troops occupied it in 1916. In 1922, the League of Nations designated Cameroon as a "mandated territory" to be managed separately by Britain and France. During World War II, the people of Cameroon participated in the anti-fascist war, fighting in Syria, Tunisia, Italy, and France, and the people of Cameroon contributed to the victory over Hitler's Germany. The people of Cameroon originally hoped to gain independence after the war, but in December 1946, the United Nations Trusteeship Council decided that Britain and France should "administer" Cameroon. Changing from a "mandated territory" to a "trusteeship" meant that the oppressors of the Cameroonian people were still the original colonialists, which was obviously contrary to the wishes of the Cameroonian people.

Cameroon is a place rich in resources, located on the equator, in the waist of the African continent. The country covers an area of ​​approximately 450,000 square kilometers, equivalent to four-fifths of the area of ​​France. It has a population of approximately 4.5 million. The French-administered area covers 425,000 square kilometers, with a population of more than 3 million, and the capital is Yaoundé; the British-administered area covers approximately 25,000 square kilometers, with a population of nearly 1.5 million, and the capital is Buea. The people of Cameroon are mainly engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry, and hunting. The main agricultural products are rice, peanuts, cocoa, coffee, bananas, rubber, and wood, with large export volumes. Minerals discovered include gold, tin, aluminum, copper, and uranium.

However, Cameroon's abundant assets only feed the colonialists and do not bring happiness to the Cameroonian people. Foreigners, who account for only 0.5% of the population, monopolize two-thirds of the country's resources. In the British-administered area, large colonial enterprises such as the "Cameroon Development Corporation" and "United Africa Company Limited" control most of the rubber, palm, and banana plantations. The colonialists reap huge profits every year. In the French-administered area, French companies, under the pretext of "ownerless wasteland," occupy entire forests and fields. Because the prices of agricultural products are very low, farmers are almost engaged in unpaid labor; while French capitalists earn staggering profits from these almost plundered agricultural products. Bananas bought in Cameroon for one franc are sold for fifty francs in Parisian restaurants.

Under the cruel exploitation of the colonialists, the lives of the Cameroonian people are in a very miserable situation. Medical and health conditions are very poor, with an average of one doctor for every 70,000 residents. Only 15% of the population is literate.

	Political Deception by Colonialists

For a long time, the French and British colonial authorities have used various methods to maintain their rule in Cameroon. In the French-administered area, the French administrative agency, headed by the French High Commissioner, has full power. In November 1956, in order to conceal its colonial face, France held so-called "municipal elections" in Cameroon. Under the leadership of the patriotic and progressive organization "Union of the Peoples of Cameroon," the Cameroonian people expressed their opposition to the colonialists' election conspiracy by abstaining in large numbers. For example, in Douala, only 8,200 people voted out of 68,000 registered voters.

On December 23, 1956, France held so-called "legislative assembly elections" in Cameroon. On the eve of the election, an anti-French patriotic movement broke out in Cameroon. The French authorities relied solely on brutal armed suppression to finally elect "parliamentary" members and, in May 1957, formed an "autonomous government" headed by Mbida, leader of the "Cameroon Democratic Party." The "Parliament" accepted the "new regulations" drafted by the French colonialists, and Cameroon's diplomacy, defense, finance, and trade were all controlled by France, while the "Legislative Assembly" and the "Government" were both subject to the French High Commissioner. Recently, the French de Gaulle government, under the guise of granting Cameroon "internal autonomy," is preparing to absorb Cameroon into the French Federation in the future, continuing to maintain its rule.

In the British-administered area, Britain administratively assigned the area to British Nigeria for management. In 1951, according to the then constitution of Nigeria, the area was divided into northern and southern parts, with the southern part becoming a directly administered unit of Nigeria and the northern part incorporated into Nigeria's Northern Province.

	Embarking on the Road of Armed Struggle

For a long time, the people of Cameroon have waged resolute struggles demanding independence and unification.

In the French-administered area, the independence struggle movement is led by the "Union of the Peoples of Cameroon" as well as the "Confederation of Cameroon Trade Unions," "Cameroon Democratic Youth Union," "Cameroon Democratic Women's Union," and other political parties and groups. The "Union of the Peoples of Cameroon" was founded in April 1948, and its battle cry is "National Unity—Independence." It has waged unremitting struggles for unification and independence, for improving people's living standards, against forced labor, racial discrimination, and the seizure of land. It enjoys high prestige among the people.

In the spring of 1955, the Cameroonian national liberation movement entered a high tide. In May, various Cameroonian democratic groups issued a joint declaration demanding an end to trusteeship and the establishment of a sovereign state of Cameroon. On May 25, the French trusteeship authorities carried out a bloody massacre of marching and demonstrating crowds in major cities in Cameroon, resulting in more than 5,000 casualties. Democratic organizations such as the "Union of the Peoples of Cameroon" were declared illegal, and many leaders and large numbers of patriots were arrested or forced into exile.

However, the colonialists' bloody suppression could not contain the development of the Cameroonian national independence movement. In the summer of 1956, under the leadership of the "Union of the Peoples of Cameroon," the people of Cameroon began an armed struggle in the forests of Sanaga-Maritime, and established a "National Organizing Committee" to carry out military leadership work.

In 1957, the struggle of the Cameroonian people for national unification and independence saw new developments. The Cameroonian underground armed struggle quickly spread to the Sanaga coastal area and the Bassa area of ​​Douala port, as well as the northwestern region. This spring, a new uprising broke out in the Bamileke region (population of approximately 500,000). The increasingly high tide of the Cameroonian people's struggle greatly alarmed the French colonialists. In August 1957, France successively dispatched eight battalions and two companies of troops to Cameroon to strengthen suppression. Currently, the number of French troops has increased to 84,000. The number of Cameroonians held in prisons and concentration camps established by the French colonialists has reached 64,000.

The movement of the Cameroonian people demanding independence has also expanded to the British-administered area. The main force leading the struggle there is the "Cameroon National Congress."

	Persisting in Striving for National Unification and Independence

The struggle of the Cameroonian people for unification and independence has received the sympathy and support of people from all countries. The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo at the end of 1957 stated in its resolution that it "supports the struggle of the Cameroonian people for unification and independence" and that "the conference condemns the violent measures taken by the French authorities in this place." In April of this year, the Conference of Independent African States held in Accra supported the proposal put forward by the Cameroonian representative, and the participating countries decided to adopt a common attitude to realize the legitimate rights of the Cameroonian people.

With the support of the people of Asian and African countries, the people of Cameroon are successfully carrying out the struggle against the French and British colonialists and for independence through armed struggle and other means.

In October of this year, the "Legislative Assembly" in Yaoundé also passed a resolution by an overwhelming majority demanding the abolition of the trusteeship agreement and "declaring the Cameroonian people's hope to see Cameroon gain independence on January 1, 1960." On November 12, the Trusteeship Committee of the United Nations General Assembly also passed a resolution requesting the trustee countries to "accelerate the realization of autonomy or independence for the trust territories," and the resolution specifically pointed out that Cameroon "can be expected to be independent or autonomous in 1960."

However, although the French colonialists superficially agreed that Cameroon would be independent on January 1, 1960, and the British colonialists agreed that West Cameroon would be independent on October 1 of the same year, they have not relaxed military suppression in the slightest. Recently, the French colonial army also conducted a week-long "cleansing" campaign, arresting many innocent people. The British colonial army also conducted two large-scale "sweeps," putting many patriots into concentration camps. The colonialists attempted to intimidate the Cameroonian people, forbidding them from talking about the issues of "independence in 1960" and "the merger of British-occupied Cameroon and French-occupied Cameroon." They want to use terror tactics to stifle the Cameroonian people's desire for independence, or at least attempt to buy time to cultivate pro-colonial forces, so that they can maintain their colonial rule in a disguised form in the future.

The Cameroonian people responded to the colonialists' military suppression and political deception with practical actions, and their will to strive for national unification and independence is unshakable. The Cameroonian people not only have the support of hundreds of millions of Africans, but also the sympathy and support of hundreds of millions of people in Asia and other countries around the world, and their just struggle will surely achieve final victory.

    喀麦隆人民争取独立和统一
    胡真
    在非洲大地上，被压迫被奴役的人民要求独立的运动风起云涌，殖民主义的锁链正在节节崩溃。英法两国政府被迫同意喀麦隆在1960年获得统一和独立，就是这种总的趋势中的一个例证。
            海盗的入侵和掠夺
    喀麦隆的历史是一部充满血泪和艰苦斗争的历史。十五世纪末年，葡萄牙、荷兰和英国的海盗们，先后侵入喀麦隆贩卖黑人，掠夺象牙。1884年德国殖民者侵占了喀麦隆。第一次世界大战期间，英法军队在1916年占领了它。1922年，国际联盟把喀麦隆作为“委任统治地”，为英法两国分管。第二次世界大战期间，喀麦隆人民参加了反法西斯战争，当时他们转战在叙利亚、突尼斯、意大利和法国，对希特勒德国的胜利中有着喀麦隆人民的功绩。喀麦隆人民原来希望战后可以获得独立，但是在1946年12月，联合国托管理事会又决定法英两国来“托管”喀麦隆。由“委任统治地”变成“托管地”，压迫喀麦隆人民的还是原来的殖民者，这显然是违背喀麦隆人民愿望的行为。
    喀麦隆是物产富庶的地方，位于赤道上面，非洲大陆的腰部。全国面积约四十五万平方公里，相当于法国面积的五分之四。人口约四百五十万。法国托管区面积为四十二万五千平方公里，人口三百多万，首府叫雅温得；英国托管区面积约二万五千平方公里，人口近一百五十万，首府是布埃亚。喀麦隆人民主要从事农业、畜牧业和打猎等，主要农产品为米、花生、可可、咖啡、香蕉、橡胶和木材，输出量很大。矿产已发现的有金、锡、铝、铜和铀等。
    但是喀麦隆的丰富资产只是喂饱了殖民者而没有给喀麦隆人民带来幸福。仅占人口0.5％的外国人霸占着全国三分之二的资源。在英国托管区，“喀麦隆开发公司”、“联合非洲有限公司”等大殖民企业掌握了大部分橡胶、棕榈和香蕉种植园。殖民者每年都获得巨额利润，在法国托管区，法国公司在“无主荒地”的借口下，侵占了整片整片的森林和田地。由于农产品价格非常低，因此农民几乎在从事无偿的劳动；而法国资本家却从这些几乎是掠夺来的农产品中赚得惊人的利润，在喀麦隆以一个法郎的价格收进的香蕉，在巴黎的餐厅里却以五十个法郎出售。
    在殖民者残酷的剥削下，喀麦隆人民的生活陷于非常悲惨的境地。医药卫生条件很差，平均每七万个居民才有一个医生。全国只有15％的居民识字。
            殖民者的政治骗局
    法英殖民当局长期以来运用各种方法力图维持它们在喀麦隆的统治。在法国托管区，掌握全权的是以法国高级专员为首的法国行政机构。1956年11月，法国为了掩饰自己的殖民面目，在喀麦隆举行了所谓“市政选举”。喀麦隆人民在爱国进步组织“喀麦隆人民联盟”的领导下，以大批弃权的方式，表示了对殖民者选举阴谋的反对。例如在杜阿拉六万八千个登记投票的人中，只有八千二百人投了票。
    1956年12月23日，法国又在喀麦隆举行了所谓“立法议会选举”。选举前夕，喀麦隆爆发了反法爱国运动。法国当局只是依靠了残暴的武装镇压，才终于选出了“议会”议员，并且于1957年5月，组成了以“喀麦隆民主党”领袖姆比达为首的“自治政府”。“议会”接受了法国殖民者拟定的“新规章”，喀麦隆的外交、国防、财政和贸易等一概由法国掌握，而
  “立法议会”和“政府”也都听命于法国的高级专员。最近，法国戴高乐政府在所谓给喀麦隆“内部自治”的幌子下，准备在将来把喀麦隆吸收到法兰西联邦，继续保持其统治权。
    在英国托管区，英国将该区在行政上划归英属尼日利亚管理。1951年，根据尼日利亚当时的宪法，该区被分为南北两部分，南部成为尼日利亚的一个直辖单位，北部并入尼日利亚的北方省。
          走上武装斗争的道路
    长期以来，喀麦隆人民进行了要求独立和统一的坚决斗争。
    在法国托管区，领导着独立斗争运动的是“喀麦隆人民联盟”以及“喀麦隆工会联合会”、“喀麦隆民主青年联盟”、“喀麦隆民主妇女联盟”等政党和团体。“喀麦隆人民联盟”成立于1948年4月，它的战斗口号是“民族团结——独立”，它为争取统一和独立，为提高人民生活水平、反对强迫劳动、种族歧视和强占土地而进行了不懈的斗争。它在人民中间享有很高的威信。
    1955年春季，喀麦隆民族解放运动进入了高潮。喀麦隆各民主团体5月间发表联合宣言，要求结束托管，建立喀麦隆主权国家。5月25日，法国托管当局对喀麦隆各大城市的游行示威群众进行了血腥大屠杀，群众伤亡达五千人以上。“喀麦隆人民联盟”等民主组织被宣布为非法，许多领袖和大批爱国人士被逮捕或被迫流亡国外。
    但是，殖民者的血腥镇压遏止不住喀麦隆民族独立运动的发展。1956年夏季，喀麦隆人民在“喀麦隆人民联盟”的领导下，在斯纳加·马利丁勒的丛林中开始了武装斗争，并设立了“全国组织委员会”来进行军事领导工作。
    1957年，喀麦隆人民争取民族统一和独立的斗争又有新的发展。喀麦隆地下武装斗争很快就在萨纳加海滨和杜阿拉港的巴萨地区以及西北部地区开展起来。今年春季，在巴米来卡地区（人口约五十万）又爆发了新的起义。喀麦隆人民日益高涨的斗争使得法国殖民者大大恐慌起来。1957年8月，法国曾先后增派八个营和两个连的军队到喀麦隆去，增强镇压力量。目前，法国军队已增至八万四千人。关在法国殖民者设立的监狱和集中营的喀麦隆人达六万四千人。
    喀麦隆人民要求独立的运动也扩大到英国托管区。那里主要领导斗争的力量是“喀麦隆国民大会”。
        坚持争取国家的统一和独立
    喀麦隆人民要求统一和独立的斗争得到了各国人民的同情和支持。1957年年底在开罗举行的亚非人民团结大会在决议中表示“支持喀麦隆人民争取统一和独立的斗争”，“大会谴责法国当局在这个地方采取的暴力措施”。今年4月，在阿克拉举行的非洲独立国家会议支持了喀麦隆代表提出的建议，与会国决定采取共同态度来实现喀麦隆人民的合法权利。
    在亚非各国人民支持下的喀麦隆人民，通过武装斗争，也通过其他方式，胜利地进行着反对法英殖民者和争取独立的斗争。
    今年10月，在雅温得的“立法议会”，也以绝大多数票通过决议，要求废除托管协定，“宣布喀麦隆人民希望见到喀麦隆在1960年1月1日获得独立”。11月12日，联合国大会托管委员会也通过了决议，要求托管国“加速实现托管地的自治或独立”，决议特别指出，喀麦隆“可望在1960年独立或自治”。
    不过，法国殖民者在表面上虽然同意喀麦隆在1960年1月1日独立，英国殖民者同意西喀麦隆在同年10月1日独立，但是它们丝毫没有放松军事镇压。最近期间，法国殖民军还进行了一次为期一周的“清乡”运动，逮捕了许多无辜人民。英国殖民军也两次进行大规模“清查”，把许多爱国者关进集中营。殖民者企图威吓喀麦隆人民，不准他们谈论“在1960年独立”和“英占喀麦隆和法占喀麦隆合并”的问题，它们想利用恐怖手段来扼杀喀麦隆人民要求独立的愿望，至少也企图争取时间来培植亲殖民者的势力，以便将来能够变相地维持它们的殖民统治。
    喀麦隆人民用实际行动回答了殖民者的军事镇压和政治欺骗，他们争取民族统一和独立的意志是不可动摇的。喀麦隆人民不仅有着亿万非洲人的支援，还有亿万亚洲和世界各国人民的同情和支持，他们的正义斗争必将得到最后胜利。
