    Shanghai State Cotton Mill No. 17 Red and Expert University Implements New Teaching Methods
    Workers Can Understand, Learn Quickly, and Comprehend Deeply
    (Our newspaper's report from Shanghai on the 12th) The teachers of the Shanghai State Cotton Mill No. 17 Red and Expert University, under the guidance of the idea of serving the working class with all their might, have come up with various methods and creatively carried out teaching work, enabling the workers to understand, learn quickly, and comprehend deeply, which has been warmly praised by the worker masses.
    When the first class of this staff amateur university had its first language lesson on "The Diligent and Hardworking Chu Xiaomei," the teacher did not lecture herself, but invited "Chu Xiaomei," a female textile worker from State Cotton Mill No. 5, a mother of five children, wearing her work clothes, to the classroom to share her personal experience. She vividly introduced how she arranged her housework, overcame difficulties, and persisted in learning. Most of the students in the first class were older female workers with many children and heavy housework. "Chu Xiaomei's" own speech gave them great encouragement. When "Chu Xiaomei" encouraged everyone to study hard, many students spoke and wrote letters of determination on the spot, promising to overcome any difficulties and study diligently and practice hard. Ye Guiying, a female worker from the cloth machine workshop, was moved to tears. She said, "I am also a mother of five children. Compared to you, I am learning too poorly. I must learn from you." The "Chu Xiaomei" who spoke in the class was actually not Chu herself, but was dressed up by a language teacher from another class. The teachers carefully studied the characteristics of this lesson, which was relatively long, with specific and vivid content, and friendly language, and used this new teaching method, which achieved very good results.
    When explaining the lesson "Writing According to Speech," the teachers, based on the content of the lesson and the students' ideological situation of thinking that speaking is easy but writing is difficult, compiled a crosstalk. Two teachers had a dialogue in the classroom, asking and answering questions, and the students listened with great interest. After listening to the crosstalk, they explained the lesson and read some articles written by senior students in the factory. Finally, the teacher asked everyone to write an article on the topic of "Think About the Past, Compare with the Present." At this time, all the students felt that writing articles was not mysterious, and everyone wrote an article on the spot. Some students wrote more than 700 words for the first time. When teaching folk songs and clapper talk, the teachers matched these works with songs and local opera tunes, and adopted a teaching method of talking and singing. As soon as the teacher sang, the students followed and sang, and the more they sang, the smoother it became. After singing, the whole class wrote folk songs and clapper talk on the spot. Each person wrote two or three songs, and some wrote as many as eight songs at a time. The folk songs and clapper talk created by the whole class were compiled into two small booklets. The two lessons, "The Leader is Among Us" and "Zhao Yiman," were both presented by the teachers themselves, who drew slides and lectured while showing them. Many other lessons adopted various methods such as visiting, discussion, recalling and comparing, telling stories, and reciting.
    Every time the math teacher gave a lesson, they wrote the teaching requirements of this lesson into an encouraging little poem and posted it in the classroom for the students to see. The students were not very clear about some concepts in geometry, so the teachers made various geometric figures out of lead wire for them to see. The pulley of the iron workshop was also moved to the classroom to help students understand the concepts of parallel lines and concentric circles. The math calculation problems compiled by the teachers themselves were mostly combined with production and the current situation, calculating the speed of textile and carding machines, the output and quality of yarn and cloth, the production leap forward targets, and the comparison of grain, cotton, and steel production between China and major capitalist countries such as the United States and Britain, and the comparison of production growth rates, and so on. The workers loved to do these exercises.
    The teachers not only adopted various methods to improve the quality of classroom teaching, but also tried to use their spare time to visit workers in workshops and work areas to understand their opinions and requirements on learning and help them solve their learning difficulties. The school also implemented eight different tutoring methods, such as pre-class tutoring, scheduled tutoring, on-demand tutoring, and naming tutoring for students with poor levels, so that students could make up for any missed classes due to official duties, illness, or personal matters in a timely manner and not fall behind.
    In addition to organizing a staff department to study and solve teaching problems, the school's administrative cadres and teachers also organized a logistics department, specializing in helping workers participating in learning to solve their living difficulties. They specially set up a nursery in the school for breastfeeding female workers, and made quilts and diapers themselves with waste cotton and packing cloth from the factory. When breastfeeding female workers went to work, their children were placed in the factory nursery (which was also in three shifts). When they got off work to go to school, they were placed in the school nursery, so that they could study with peace of mind. The school also bought breakfast needed by night shift workers together every morning and brought it to the classroom by the teacher to sell to them, so that these night shift workers would not be late for school in the morning because they went to the street to buy breakfast, or go to class hungry because they did not have time to buy breakfast.
    These actions of the teachers deeply moved the workers. Many workers wrote poems and articles warmly praising their schools and teachers. They excitedly said: You are really good teachers for us workers. We can only do our best to study hard to answer your care.

    上海国棉十七厂红专大学试行新教学法
    工人听得进　学得快　懂得深
    本报上海12日电　上海国棉十七厂红专大学的教师们在尽一切力量为工人阶级服务的思想指导下，想出各种办法，创造性地进行教学工作，使工人们听得进、学得快、理解得深，受到工人群众的热烈赞扬。
    这个职工业余大学第一班上第一课语文“勤学苦练的褚小妹”的时候，教师自己不讲述，而是把身穿工作服的国棉五厂纺织女工、五个孩子的母亲“褚小妹”请到教室里来，向学员们现身说法，生动地介绍了自己如何安排家务，克服困难，坚持学习的故事。第一班的学员大都是年龄较大、子女较多、家务繁重的女工，“褚小妹”自己的讲话给她们很大的鼓舞，当“褚小妹”勉励大家努力学习时，许多学员当堂发言，写决心书，保证要克服任何困难，勤学苦练。布机间女工叶桂英感动得流泪了，她说，我也是五个孩子的母亲，比起你来，我学得太差了，一定要向你学习。在班上讲话的这位“褚小妹”其实并不是褚本人，而是由别班的语文教师装扮的。教师们认真研究了这篇课文较长、内容具体生动、语言亲切，又是用第一人称等特点，采取了这种新的教学方法，取得了很好的效果。
    在讲解“照着话写”这一课时，教师们根据课文内容，结合学员中认为说话容易写作难等等思想情况，编成一篇相声。两个教师在课堂上对话，边问边答，学生们听得津津有味。听完相声后，再讲解课文，阅读本厂高年级学员写的一些文章，最后教师以“想想过去，比比现在”为题，让大家自己写文章。这时，全班学员都已感到写文章并不神秘，当堂人人都写了文章，有的学员第一次写就写了七百多字。教民歌、快板时，教师们就将这些作品配上歌曲和地方剧的调子，采取说说唱唱的方式教学。教师一唱，学生也跟着唱起来，愈唱愈顺口，唱完以后，全班当堂就来写民歌、快板，每人都写了二、三首，多的一次就写了八首。全班创作的民歌、快板一下就编成了二本小册子。“领袖在我们中间”和“赵一曼”两课，都由教师们自己绘制了幻灯片，一面看一面讲。还有许多课文，采取了参观、讨论、回忆对比、讲故事、朗诵等多种方式进行教学。
    数学教师每次上课时，将这一课的教学要求写成一首鼓动性的小诗贴在教室里给学员看。学员们对几何学上的一些概念不大清楚，教师就用铅丝做成各种几何图形给他们看。铁工间的皮带盘也被搬到课堂里来帮助学生了解平行线和同心圆的概念。教师们自己编的数学计算题大都是结合生产和当前形势，计算纺织、梳棉机器的车速、纱和布的产量质量、生产跃进指标、中国和美英等主要资本主义国家粮食、棉花、钢铁产量的对比与生产增长速度的对比，等等。工人们很爱做这些习题。
    教师们不仅采取各种方法提高课堂教学的质量，还尽量利用空隙时间下车间、工房访问工人，了解他们学习上的意见与要求，帮助他们解决学习上的困难。学校还实行课前补课、预约补课、随到随补、对程度差的学员点名补课等八种不同的补课办法，务使学员不论因公、因病、因事缺了课，都能及时补好，不致跟不上班。
    学校行政干部和教师们除了组织了一个参谋部研究解决教学问题外，还组织了一个后勤部，专门帮助参加学习的工人解决生活上的困难。他们特地在校内为哺乳女工们办了一个托儿所，自己用厂里的废棉花和打包布做了棉被和尿布。哺乳女工上班时孩子放在工厂托儿所（也是三班制），下了班来上学时，就放在学校托儿所，这样她们也能安心学习了。学校每天早上还把夜班工人需要的早点一起代为买来，由教师带到教室里卖给他们，使这些夜班工人早上来上学时不致于因上街买早点而迟到，或来不及买早点而饿着上课。
    教师们的这些行动使工人深受感动，许多工人写了诗歌和文章热烈赞美自己的学校和教师。他们激动地说：你们真是我们工人的好老师，我们只有尽最大的努力搞好学习，来回答你们的关怀。
