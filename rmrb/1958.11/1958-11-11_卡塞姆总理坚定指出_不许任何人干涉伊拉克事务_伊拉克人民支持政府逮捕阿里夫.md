Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 10th—Iraqi Republic Prime Minister Qassem, when meeting with former British Chancellor of the Exchequer and Trade, Thorneycroft, on the 9th, responded to his questions by saying, “Generally speaking, we are a neutral country with complete sovereignty, and we have absolute freedom in our actions. We Arab countries solve our own problems. No one is allowed to interfere in our affairs. Iraq's primary concern is the interests of the people, and at the same time, for the interests of the Arab nation, it pays attention to full cooperation with Arab countries in all aspects.”

The Iraqi Republic Radio broadcast Prime Minister Qassem's remarks on the 9th. In answering questions raised by Thorneycroft, he spoke about the Iraqi Republic's foreign policy and its relations with other Arab countries.

Prime Minister Qassem, when answering the question of whether Iraq would maintain its independence when cooperating with other Arab countries, said, "The Iraqi Interim Constitution stipulates very clearly that we are now in a transitional period. During this period, we will dedicate ourselves to raising the level of the people, so that the symbols of culture enter every home, every village, and every district. We will dedicate ourselves to improving our country's health, cultural, and social conditions. Through these, every member of the masses will feel completely at ease and will express their opinions after the end of the transition period, and we must act according to the opinions of the people. At the same time, I also have an opinion among the opinions of the masses, and I will publish it after the end of this period. I want to affirm to you that, whether within or after the transition period, we will cooperate to the maximum extent with our Arab brotherly countries in all aspects. We will also cooperate without exception with all friendly countries that are willing to befriend us.”

In this regard, he expressed his agreement with Thorneycroft's understanding that the basic task of the Iraqi Republic now is to strengthen internal work before proceeding with other things, including handling foreign relations.

Prime Minister Qassem emphasized in his remarks that the Iraqi people are willing to befriend the people of the world and harbor no aggressive intentions towards anyone. He said, "The Iraqi Republic is determined to maintain friendship with all countries in the world that are willing to be friendly with Iraq, on the basis of mutual benefit, and to guarantee the interests of the people."

(Combined report from this newspaper) Since the 6th, thousands of letters and countless telegrams have been sent from all over Iraq to Baghdad's newspaper offices and radio stations. They come from all strata of the Iraqi people, including workers, students, lawyers, women, and mothers. These letters and telegrams all express the people's complete support for their leader, Qassem, and demonstrate their opposition to all imperialist conspiracies.

A telegram issued by one hundred and ninety students said: "We express our full support for your action in arresting Arif. Your wise policies will lead the country to progress. Long live our free, democratic Republic!"

A telegram from workers said: "We firmly support the measures you have taken. We will sacrifice everything to safeguard the freedom of our republic. Long live our leader! Long live world peace!"

The Republic Radio broadcast on the 5th a telegram signed by Yahsin Muhammad and twenty others, saying to Qassem: We support you with our lives in using an iron fist to eliminate all those who dare to undermine the security of our democratic republic.

A tribal chief, Nawal Amin, representing seven hundred and fifty families, expressed in a telegram his heartfelt congratulations to Qassem for the actions taken against those who conspired to undermine the security of the republic. The telegram said, we will use our lives and property to defend the existence of the republic.

Teachers and staff of Garbia Middle School, Sofaer, and twenty-seven others, expressed in a telegram their support for Qassem's strong measures against conspirators, with the belief that "the interests of the people are above personal interests."

On the 5th, people from all walks of life in Iraq held demonstrations to express support for the government's wise measures. Farmers also participated in the processions in various places.
