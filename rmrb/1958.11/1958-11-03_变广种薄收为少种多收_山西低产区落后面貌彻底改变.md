Transforming Extensive Planting with Low Yields into Intensive Planting with High Yields
Shanxi's Low-Yield Areas Completely Change Their Backward Appearance

(Our newspaper reporter Yang Yi reports) Shanxi Province's "Basic Farmland" system, established throughout the province this year, has yielded tremendous results. Areas with sparse population and low yields have transformed from extensive cultivation and low yields to intensive cultivation and high yields, resulting in a great leap forward in production. The long-standing backwardness in production has been fundamentally and greatly changed.

The more than 37 million mu of "Basic Farmland" for grain crops established in Shanxi Province this year has yielded an unprecedented bumper harvest in the province's history. The yield of summer crops generally doubled compared to the past, and it has become a common phenomenon for terraced fields in mountainous areas to increase two or three times. The increase in autumn crops is even more significant. As of mid-October, statistics show that more than ten counties in mountainous areas such as Taihang and Lüliang have achieved an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu for summer and autumn grain crops. Jinxi and Jinxi areas, known for their low yields, have seen many counties jump from an average yield of dozens of jin per mu in the past to achieving and exceeding the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) targets of 400 jin and 500 jin ahead of schedule this year. The low-yield appearance of the Yanbei ancient Great Wall border area has also been changed. In Shlou County, Lüliang Mountains, fifteen hundred large gullies criss-cross, most cultivated land are steep slopes, barren soil, and low yield. Historically, the average yield has never exceeded seventy-five jin. This year, over 200,000 mu of cultivated land was abandoned, and 120,000 mu of "Basic Farmland" were established on plateau gullies and flatlands. The average yield of the county was 1,004 jin per mu, a nineteen and a half-fold increase compared to last year; the total output rose to over 100 million jin, an increase of more than five times compared to last year. Due to the implementation of the "Basic Farmland" system, low-yield areas in various places have transformed into high-yield areas, and high-yield areas have become even higher-yielding. The average yield of summer and autumn grain crops in the province this year reached 500 jin per mu, equivalent to four times the average yield last year; the total output increased by 130% compared to the bumper harvest year of 1956.

With the implementation of the "Basic Farmland" system, the three major transformations in mountainous areas (soil and water conservation, water conservancy construction, and afforestation) have also been greatly promoted. In the Jinan area, after planning and establishing "Basic Farmland," more than 1,000 large and small rivers have been treated so far, controlling an area of more than 7.41 million mu, an achievement in a few months equivalent to 103% of the area controlled since liberation. Ten counties with terraced ridges and eighteen counties with terraced fields have emerged. In order to ensure increased production in "Basic Farmland," the Xin County area has newly developed 3.59 million mu of mountainous water conservancy areas throughout the region. Together with the original water conservancy area, more than half of the "Basic Farmland" has been transformed into irrigated land. Wuzhai and Shenchi counties in the Jinxi Plateau, which lack water conservancy facilities, have also basically achieved water conservancy. In addition, the afforestation area in the province has reached 70% of the suitable afforestation area, and thirty-five counties have completed and basically completed the afforestation task in the whole territory this year.

In the past, Shanxi Province had 68 million mu of cultivated land, more than half of which was sloping land with low yields, most of which yielded less than 100 jin per mu. The characteristics of these low-yield areas are: sparse population, barren soil, severe soil erosion, coupled with insufficient labor and livestock, and a lack of three materials (fertilizer, fuel, and feed). Therefore, agricultural production has long been characterized by extensive cultivation with low yields. In the Jinxi area, each male laborer is responsible for an average of 50 mu of cultivated land, with an average yield of only dozens of jin per mu in good years and more than ten jin per mu in bad years. Due to the drag of these low-yield areas, the total grain output of the province has been fluctuating between 7 billion and 9 billion jin for nearly five years, never exceeding the 10 billion jin mark. Therefore, with the development of the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, changing the backward appearance of low-yield areas has become a key issue in increasing agricultural production in Shanxi Province.

The "Basic Farmland" system is to take revolutionary measures in areas with a lot of cultivated land and lack of labor and livestock to stop cultivating part of the cultivated land that is not suitable for growing crops and return it to grass and forests; retain a certain amount of high-quality land, which is called "Basic Farmland." Concentrate manpower and materials to do a good job in "Basic Farmland", processing and management, implementing intensive cultivation and meticulous farming, and using the method of less planting and more harvesting to replace the habit of extensive planting and low harvesting. This major reform was gradually summarized by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China through investigation and research on mass experience. In the investigation and research on the experience and measures of continuous production increase in the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Ningwu County and the Mijata Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongyang County, the Provincial Party Committee found that these agricultural cooperatives, in response to the situation of more land and insufficient labor, planned to stop cultivating part of the cultivated land and establish "Basic Farmland" to carefully cultivate and meticulously farm. As a result, less planting was better than more planting, and low yield quickly reached high yield. The Provincial Party Committee summarized and promoted this experience, and then mobilized the masses from top to bottom to conduct large-scale debates in conjunction with local conditions. After discussions in various places, it was generally welcomed, believing that this was a faster, better, and more economical way to change the production appearance of low-yield areas. Therefore, it was universally promoted from 1958.

This year, Shanxi Province has mainly focused on two links in promoting the "Basic Farmland" system: The first is to vigorously carry out the movement to establish "Basic Farmland". Various places have generally returned the original inferior land that was far from the village, with steep slopes and extremely low yields in a planned way, and selected cultivated land that was closer to the village, concentrated in contiguous areas, suitable for the development of water conservancy, and convenient transportation, as "Basic Farmland." In "Basic Farmland," five construction measures, such as building ridges, building terraces, bringing water conservancy to the mountains, applying a large amount of fertilizer, and carrying out close planting and intensive cultivation, have been universally implemented. The other link is to vigorously carry out the utilization of retired cultivated land, as rotation fields for pasture and crops, and for afforestation and the development of fruit production. Therefore, this year is a year of great change in the low-yield appearance in various places, and at the same time, it is a year of great development of multiple economies.

    变广种薄收为少种多收
    山西低产区落后面貌彻底改变
    本报讯　记者杨义报道：山西省今年在全省范围内建立的“基本农田”制度收到了巨大效果。地广人稀产量较低的地区变耕作粗放、广种薄收为精耕细作、少种多收，生产大放光芒，长期以来生产的落后面貌已从根本上大大改观。
    山西省今年初建的三千七百多万亩粮食作物“基本农田”，获得了山西省历史上从所未有的大丰收。夏收作物产量一般比过去提高了一倍，山区水平梯田翻两番、三番已成为普遍现象。秋作物增产效果更为突出，截至10月中旬统计：太行、吕梁等山区已出现了十多个夏秋粮食作物平均亩产千斤以上的县。以低产称著的晋西北、晋西地区，有许多县今年由过去平均亩产数十斤一跃而提前实现和突破了全国农业发展纲要（草案）四百斤、五百斤指标。雁北古长城塞上地区低产面貌也得到改变。吕梁山区石楼县全县一千五百多条大沟壑纵横交错，绝大部分耕地是陡坡、垣地，土地瘠薄，产量很低，历史上平均亩产最高也没有超过七十五斤。今年弃耕了二十多万亩耕地，在垣沟地和平川地上建立了十二万亩“基本农田”，全县亩产平均到一千零四斤，比去年提高了十九倍半；总产量上升到一亿多斤，比去年增产了五倍以上。由于贯彻“基本农田”制度，各地低产区低产变高产、高产更高产。全省今年夏秋粮食作物平均亩产达到五百斤，相当于去年平均亩产的四倍；总产量比大丰收的1956年提高了130％。
    随着“基本农田”制度的推行，对山区三大改造工作（水土保持、水利建设、植树造林）也起了巨大的促进作用。晋南地区在规划、建立“基本农田”后，到目前已集中治理了大、小河流一千多个，控制面积达到七百四十一万多亩，几个月的成就相当于解放以来控制面积的103％，并出现了十个地埂化和十八个梯田化的县。忻县地区为了保证“基本农田”增产，全区新开发山区水利面积三百五十九万亩，连同原有水利面积，半数以上的“基本农田”已变成了水浇地。晋西北高原缺乏水利的五寨、神池县也已基本实现水利化。另外，全省绿化面积达到了宜林面积的70％，有三十五个县在今年完成和基本完成了全境绿化任务。
    山西省过去共有耕地六千八百万亩，其中半数以上是坡地，产量低，大部分亩产在百斤以下。这部分低产区的特点是：地广人稀，地力瘠薄，水土流失严重，加以劳畜力不足、三料（肥、燃、饲料）俱缺。因此在农业生产上长期是耕作粗放，广种薄收，产量低。晋西北地区每个男劳力平均负担五十亩耕地，好年成亩产不过数十斤，坏年成亩产十多斤。由于这部分低产区的牵扯，全省粮食总产量近五年来一直在七十亿到九十亿斤之间摇摆不前，从未突破百亿斤大关。因此，随着农业大跃进的新形势发展，改变低产区落后面貌，就成为山西省农业增产中的关键问题了。
    “基本农田”制度，就是要在耕地多、劳畜力缺乏的地区，采取革命的方法停耕一部分不适宜种农作物的耕地，还草还林；保留一定数量的优等地，称之为“基本农田”。集中人力物力作好“基本农田”，加工管理，实行精耕细作，用少种多收的办法代替广种薄收的沿习。这一重大改革是中共山西省委通过调查研究群众经验逐步总结出来的。省委在调查研究宁武县前进农业社、中阳县米家塔等农业社连年增产的经验措施中，发现这些农业社针对土地多、劳力不足等情况，有计划地停耕一部分耕地，建立“基本农田”，精耕细作，结果少种比多种强，由低产迅速达到高产。省委总结、发扬了这一经验，然后自上而下地发动群众结合当地情况大鸣大放大辩论，经过各地讨论，普遍受到欢迎，认为这是改变低产区生产面貌的一种多、快、好、省的道路。于是从1958年起普遍推广。
    山西省各地今年推行“基本农田”制度主要抓住两个环节：第一是大力开展建立“基本农田”运动。各地普遍把原有离村远、坡度陡、产量极低的劣地有计划地退耕，挑选了距村较近、集中连片、适宜发展水利、交通方便的耕地，作为“基本农田”。在“基本农田”里普遍实行培地埂、修梯田，水利上山，大量增施肥料，进行密植，精耕细作等五项建设性的措施。另一环是大力进行了退耕土地的利用，作为牧草、农作物的轮作田和用作造林发展果树生产。因而今年各地是大大改变低产面貌的一年，同时又是多种经济大发展的一年。
