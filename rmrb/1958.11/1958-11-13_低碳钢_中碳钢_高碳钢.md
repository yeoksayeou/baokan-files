    Low Carbon Steel, Medium Carbon Steel, High Carbon Steel
    The common method for distinguishing steel and iron is determined by the amount of carbon content. Steel is made by reducing some carbon from iron.
    According to usual regulations, anything with a carbon content of 1.7% (or 2%) or less is steel, and anything more is iron. Low carbon steel has a carbon content of 0.25% or less, medium carbon steel has a carbon content of 0.26% - 0.6%, and high carbon steel has a carbon content greater than 0.6%.
    Different carbon contents in steel result in different properties and uses. Low carbon steel has relatively poor strength but good ductility and is generally used to make nails, wire, steel pipes, and steel plates. Medium carbon steel has a certain tensile strength and ductility and is generally used as shaft material, construction material, and to manufacture agricultural machinery. High carbon steel has strong tensile strength and good wear resistance, but poor ductility, and is generally used to manufacture machine tools, tools, steel rails, as well as high-strength rebar and steel wire.

    低碳钢　中碳钢　高碳钢
    常用的钢和铁的区分方法是由含碳量的多少决定的。钢就是由铁中减去一部分碳而成的。
    按通常规定，含碳量在1.7％（或2％）以下的就是钢，超过的是铁。含碳量在0.25％以下的是低碳钢，含碳0.26％——0.6％的是中碳钢，大于0.6％的是高碳钢。
    钢的含碳量不同，性质和用途也就不一样。低碳钢的强度比较差，但展延性好，一般可制洋钉、铁丝、钢管和钢板等。中碳钢具有一定的抗张力和展延性，一般可用作轴料、建筑材料和制造农业机械。高碳钢抗张力强，耐磨性好，但展延性差，一般可以用来制造机床、工具、钢轨以及高强度的钢筋和钢丝。
