"Three Combinations" Create Miracles
Yizhong Electric Motor Factory's Monthly Output Exceeds Last Year's Total by One Time

    According to the *Jiefang Daily*, the Yizhong Electric Motor Factory in Shanghai overcame the problem of insufficient integration between technicians and the masses of workers in its October production. Under the leadership of the Party, the factory implemented the "three combinations" of cadres, workers, and technicians, launched a vigorous technical revolution, and created an unprecedented production miracle. The output in one month exceeded the total output of the entire last year by one time, and they outstandingly completed the manufacturing task of seventy-five 1800 kVA ferroalloy furnace transformers entrusted by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and received praise from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry.

    The factory received the task of manufacturing seventy-five ferroalloy furnace transformers for silicon-iron smelting for the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in the third quarter. The original plan was to complete it within October and November, but due to urgent need, it was changed to be completed entirely within October. Such a large task, concentrated from material input to completion within one month, was obviously very difficult. After repeated research, the factory leadership felt that only by vigorously mobilizing the masses to launch a vigorous technical revolution could they overcome the difficulties and complete the task. Therefore, they held several factory-wide mass meetings in succession, explained the principles to everyone, assigned tasks, broke down difficulties, and called on everyone to participate and use their brains to carry out the technical revolution movement.

    The workers and technicians of the entire factory immediately took action, studying and improving technology. But at the beginning, the technicians and workers did not integrate well. You were in charge of your work, and I was in charge of mine, and each did their own thing, so the effect was not significant. Because the original design and processing of the voltage regulator were complicated and easily damaged, the technicians tried to improve the design structure, changing the support porcelain bottle of the voltage regulator to wood that had been processed. However, this kind of wood had very high requirements and was not easy to obtain, so it was difficult to adopt the new design. Coincidentally, the workshop workers were also thinking about the support porcelain bottle. They used a large number of discarded low-voltage samples in the factory to make the support porcelain bottle. The quality was good, and the materials were easy to obtain. When the technicians' new design drawings were handed over to the workers for production, the workers' improved voltage regulator had just been manufactured. After comparing the two, the support porcelain bottle improved by the workers was better than the design of the technicians, while in other places, the technicians' design was better than the workers' improvement.

    This matter gave the factory leaders a great inspiration. Therefore, they mobilized the technicians to go down, contracted by work section groups, and closely integrated with the workers to carry out the technical revolution. The technicians also deeply realized from improving the design that it was not a solution to rely solely on a few people to innovate behind closed doors. They all voluntarily went to the work section groups to work alongside the workers, discuss and solve the difficult problems encountered in the technical revolution. As a result, a heat wave of technical revolution was immediately set off. Many innovation projects that were originally considered separately by workers or technicians were realized one by one because theory and practice, technology and labor were combined, complementing each other's weaknesses and learning from each other's strengths. For example, the area of ​​the drying room in the winding section was not enough and needed to be expanded, which required a lot of investment. Some technicians were often concerned about this problem. Now the workers came up with a way to put together wood and asbestos board, and added a few infrared light bulbs. They built an indigenous drying room without spending much money. The use effect was as good as that of a foreign drying room. In this month, workers and technicians completed a total of forty-seven major improvements, which had a great effect on improving production efficiency and saving materials and labor.

    While jointly studying and improving technology, the technicians also frequently helped the workers to become familiar with the drawings, familiar with the operating techniques, explained the processing requirements, and assisted in solving various specific problems.

    Cadres also closely integrated with technicians and workers. Workshop cadres often analyzed key production points with technicians and veteran workers and studied solutions; factory leaders each contracted a work section, checked problems every day, and held scheduling meetings every night to solve problems. In this way, the rapid solution of key production points was further guaranteed, which greatly helped the on-time completion of production tasks.

    “三结合”创奇迹
    益中电机厂一个月产量超过去年一倍
    据解放日报消息　上海益中电机厂在10月份生产中，克服技术人员和工人群众结合不密切的现象，在党的领导下实行干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”，大闹技术革命，创造了前所未有的生产奇迹。一个月的产量超过去年全年总产量一倍，出色地完成了冶金工业部委托的七十五台一千八百千伏安铁合金炉变压器的制造任务，受到了冶金工业部的表扬。
    这个厂在第三季度接到为冶金工业部制造七十五台炼矽铁用的铁合金炉变压器的任务，原来计划在10、11两个月内完成，后因需要急迫，改为在10月份内全部完成。这样大的任务，从投料到完成都集中在一个月内，困难显然是很大的。厂的领导方面经过再三研究，觉得只有大力发动群众大闹技术革命，才能克服困难，完成任务。于是接连召开了几次全厂性的群众大会，向大家说道理，交任务，摊困难，号召人人动手，个个动脑，开展技术革命运动。
    全厂工人和技术人员当即纷纷行动起来，研究改进技术。但开始时，技术人员和工人没有结合好，你管你，我管我，各搞一套，效果不显著。技术人员因为调压器原来的设计加工复杂，容易损坏，就琢磨改进设计结构，把调压器的支架瓷瓶改用加工处理后的木头来做。但这种木头要求很高，不易得到，新设计采用有困难。恰巧，车间工人也在支架瓷瓶上动脑筋。他们用厂内大量废弃的低压样板来做支架瓷瓶，质量既好，材料又容易得到。等到技术人员新设计的图纸交给工人生产时，刚好工人改进的调压器也制造出来了。两者一比较，工人改进的支架瓷瓶要比技术人员设计的好，而在另外一些地方，技术人员的设计又比工人改的好。
    这件事给工厂的领导干部一个很大的启发。于是发动技术人员下去，按工段小组分工包干，和工人紧紧结合起来搞技术革命。技术人员从改进设计中也深深体会到光靠少数人关了房门搞革新不是办法，都自愿到工段小组去跟班劳动，和工人一道商量和解决技术革命中遇到的困难问题。这样一来，技术革命立即掀起热潮。许多原来由工人或技术人员分别考虑的革新项目，由于理论与实践、技术和劳动一结合，互补所短，互取所长，都一一实现了。如绕装工段烘房面积不够，要扩大，需用很多投资，有的技术人员常为这个问题操心。现在工人想办法用木头和石棉板拼拼搭搭，加装几只红外线灯泡，没花多少钱就造成了土烘房，使用效果和洋烘房一样好。在这一个月中，工人和技术人员搞成的重大改进共有四十七项，对提高生产效率、节省材料、人工有很大作用。
    在共同研究改进技术的同时，技术人员还经常帮助工人熟悉图纸、熟悉操作技术，讲解加工要求，协助解决各种具体问题。
    干部也紧紧和技术人员、工人结合。车间干部经常和技术人员、老工人一起分析生产关键，研究解决的措施；厂的领导干部每人包干一个工段，天天查问题，每晚开调度会议，解决问题。这样，就更加保证了生产关键的迅速解决，大大有助于生产任务的如期完成。
