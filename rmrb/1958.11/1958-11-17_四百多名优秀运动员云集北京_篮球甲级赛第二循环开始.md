More Than Four Hundred Excellent Athletes Gather in Beijing
Second Round of Basketball League A Begins

    (Our report) The second round of the 1958 National Basketball League A competition began yesterday in Beijing. Yesterday afternoon and evening, a total of six women's and six men's matches were played. As a result, the women's teams of Tianjin, Shanghai White, Beijing, Coal Mine, Shanghai Red, and Bayi defeated Yunnan, Wuhan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Guangzhou, and Sichuan, respectively. The men's teams of Shanghai Red, Bayi, Sichuan, Beijing, Nanjing Military Region, and Shenyang defeated Tianjin, Shenyang Military Region, Public Security, Jiangsu, Shanghai White, and Beijing Military Region, respectively. The men's match between Shanghai Red and Tianjin was tense and exciting. The two teams were evenly matched and had very similar styles. Throughout the game, the scores of both sides rose in a seesaw manner. After forty minutes, the scores were equal, and there was no winner. In the five-minute overtime, Tianjin was in the lead until the last few seconds, still leading by one point, but due to a lack of composure in defense, Shanghai Red scored a goal just before the end of the game, resulting in a one-point defeat for Tianjin.
    This competition brings together the best men's and women's basketball teams in the country, including Beijing, "Bayi," Tianjin, and Shanghai, totaling twenty-four teams and more than four hundred of the most outstanding basketball players. Since the end of the first round of competition in April this year, after a period of rest and reorganization, the political ideology and technical level of each team have improved. The athletes of each team are determined to play their own style in this competition and further develop the flexible and fast characteristics of China's basketball movement.
    On the morning of the 15th, Rong Gaotang, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, gave a mobilization report to the athletes participating in this league. He asked the athletes to learn from each other through this competition, jointly improve their basketball skills, and cultivate communist moral qualities. He also required the referees to do their work appropriately, not to restrict or affect the improvement of athletes' technical level, and to cultivate and train athletes to adapt to the level of international competition through referee work.
    This competition is the most intense and exciting one this year since the first round of competition. The champion and runner-up will be determined after the second round of competition. The competition is expected to end on the 25th.

    四百多名优秀运动员云集北京
    篮球甲级赛第二循环开始
    本报讯　1958年全国篮球队甲级队联赛第二循环比赛从昨日在北京开始进行。昨天下午和晚上共进行了六场女子和六场男子比赛。结果女子队天津、上海白、北京、煤矿、上海红、八一分别战胜云南、武汉、河北、江苏、广州、四川，男子队上海红、八一、四川、北京、南京部队、沈阳分别战胜天津、沈阳部队、公安、江苏、上海白、北京部队。男子队上海红对天津一场紧张精彩。两队打法势均力敌，风格很相似。全场比赛双方比分始终是犬牙交错般地上升，四十分钟完了，双方比分相等，不分胜负。延长五分钟再战，天津一直占先，直至最后十几秒钟还胜一分，但因防守不够沉着，终场前被上海红投中一球，结果反败给上海红一分。
    这次比赛集中了全国最好的北京、“八一”、天津、上海等二十四个男、女篮球队，四百多名最优秀的篮球运动员。各队自从今年4月第一循环比赛结束，经过了一段休整后，政治思想和技术水平都有所提高。各队的运动员们决心在这次比赛中打出自己的风格来，进一步发挥我国篮球运动的灵活、迅速等特点。
    15日上午，体育运动委员会副主任荣高棠，曾给参加这次联赛的运动员们作了动员报告。他要求运动员要通过这次比赛来共同学习、共同提高篮球技术水平和培养共产主义的道德品质。他还要求裁判员的工作要作得适当，不要限制和影响运动员技术水平的提高，要通过裁判工作培养训练运动员适应国际比赛的水平。
    这次比赛是今年继第一循环比赛后最紧张最精彩的一次。第二循环比赛结束后将产生冠军、亚军。比赛预计到25日结束。
