    A Struggle at the Xuguang People's Commune
    By Our Reporter Zhang Wei
    Not long after the establishment of the Xuguang People's Commune in Echeng, a three-day党员大会 (party member conference) was held, attended by more than 500 party members and activists. At the meeting, more than 3,400 big-character posters were put up criticizing Hu Changbi, the deputy director of the commune. One of them read:
    "The People's Commune is established, everyone is happy but you are worried.
    Your commune is rich, other communes are poor, you are afraid of losing out;
    First, you fear income will decrease, second, you fear machines will be transferred out,
    Third, you fear labor will be drawn away, fourth, you fear the small commune's red flag will fall.
    Hu Changbi, oh Hu Changbi, today everyone advises you:
    Keep the title of party member firmly in mind, discard erroneous thoughts."
    The deputy director of the commune, Hu Changbi, was originally the Party Branch Secretary and Director of the Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative. This cooperative was well-known in Hubei Province, with original public accumulation of more than 167,900 yuan, including a tractor, a combine harvester, and a lathe, and five water pumps. This year, this cooperative merged with the neighboring Xuguang No. 4 Cooperative to form a large commune, and he was quite active seeing that the income and accumulation of the No. 4 Cooperative were almost the same as theirs. However, when the members of 49 cooperatives in the six townships of Dushan, Hengshan, Linjiang, Donggang, Xinjian, and Putuan requested to establish the Xuguang People's Commune with Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative as the center during August and September, he saw that the production, income, and accumulation of some cooperatives were far worse than theirs, and he began to mutter in his heart: "If dozens of cooperatives merge at once and are leveled out, wouldn't our cooperative's income decrease?" He was quite reluctant.
    One day, when the township Party committee held a meeting to study the establishment of the People's Commune, he proposed at the meeting: "Merging is merging, but the public accumulation of each cooperative must be aligned, and no cooperative can suffer a loss." As soon as he said this, the Party Branch Secretaries of various cooperatives felt that he was demonstrating to everyone: "My rich cooperative will only merge with rich cooperatives; if I merge with poor cooperatives, I will suffer a loss, and I won't do things that will make me lose out." At that time, Ke Hengmu, the Party Branch Secretary of Xuguang No. 8 Cooperative, said tentatively: "I'm afraid it shouldn't be like this, right?" Hu Changbi immediately glared and slammed the table: "My lathe is worth more than 7,000 yuan, what do you have in your cooperative?"
    At the founding meeting of the commune, Hu Changbi also put forward three opinions: First, the distribution after the establishment of the commune should be based on the past income, this year's income, and this year's expenditure of each small cooperative. Second, the ownership of the fixed assets and various machines of the small cooperatives belongs to the commune, but the right to use them should be retained by the original small cooperatives. Third, the commune's transfer of labor must be carried out after meeting the needs of the small cooperatives.
    Shi Gang, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, learned about this situation and personally talked to him, criticizing his departmentalism and the thinking of a well-to-do middle peasant. But he couldn't get his head around it, and under the control of departmentalism, Hu Changbi looked gloomy and was too lazy to pay attention to anything in the cooperative. During the district team competition, Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative, which had consistently won the Great Leap Forward Red Flag, was downgraded to an Advanced Red Flag Cooperative (the competition red flags are divided into three types: Great Leap Forward, Leap Forward, and Advanced). Then, the Advanced Red Flag was snatched away by the Second Brigade (formerly Xuguang No. 2 Cooperative), which had always had lower production than them.
    Under the influence of Hu Changbi, the red flag of Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative really fell. This was a major event for all the party members and members of the cooperative. Therefore, the Party Committee of the Xuguang People's Commune convened a meeting of all party members and launched a great debate, starting with an examination of production and a discussion of distribution. Hu Changbi's thinking became the object of everyone's debate. More than 20 party members from the original Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative first presented him with an accounting of how Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative became rich.
    "Of the total public accumulation of 167,940 yuan, the materials and machines donated by various units or devolved or sold to the cooperative by the state on credit are worth 93,750 yuan, accounting for 55.73% of the accumulation. Only 74,186 yuan was purchased by ourselves, accounting for only 44.18% of the public accumulation. When the cooperative was short of funds, the state provided timely loans, and when the township distributed fertilizer, the most was always allocated to the No. 1 Cooperative. During the busy farming season, the various agencies and schools also supported 4,820 labor forces without compensation." At the meeting, Hu Fengying, who usually didn't like to speak, criticized Hu Changbi, saying: "If everyone was like you, who would be willing to send you so many machines? Who would be willing to support you with so much labor for nothing? Isn't it because people have communist ideas!" She continued: "Our cooperative is now a rich cooperative, but was it rich in the past? When we first established the cooperative, the well-to-do middle peasants, Wang Jiating and the others, disliked us poor peasants for being poor and didn't want to partner with us. Now that we are rich, you think that poor cooperatives want to sponge off us. Isn't this the thinking of a well-to-do middle peasant? Don't forget the pain once the wound heals, and think about where the happy life comes from!" Some people used the facts of the great development of production after the office commune to ask Hu Changbi: "When we were a small cooperative, we couldn't even spare people to build a blast furnace. When we established a large commune, we mobilized more than 16,000 people to build steel, and we also built pig farms, five middle schools, and sixty-eight primary schools. If dozens of cooperatives hadn't joined together to establish a People's Commune, and according to your idea, only a few rich cooperatives were merged together, could there have been so many people, so much power, to do such a great undertaking?"
    Listening to everyone's criticism, Hu Changbi's mood became heavy. He carefully thought about the growth of the cooperative, and thought about how he himself had risen from a poor peasant to the life of a middle peasant:
    There are 378 households in Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative, of which 259 are poor peasants. Each mu of land only produced 20 to 30 jin of cotton. In 1953, when Hu Changbi and the others turned from mutual aid teams to cooperatives, there were only 19 households. The well-to-do middle peasants Wang Jiating and Tan Fengmao and these several strong (meaning strong in plows, farm tools, labor, and land) households, ridiculed them as a "bare cooperative" and were unwilling to partner with them, and proudly said: "My wealth is my own wealth." At that time, in order to solve the difficulties of the poor peasants, the government loaned them 4,000 yuan of cooperative funds. In 1954, their cooperative showed great superiority in overcoming the flood. Wang Jiating and the others asked to join the cooperative, but when collecting the shareholding funds, they were unwilling to put their new waterwheel into the cooperative, and also ridiculed the poor peasants as "old pits, old ponds" that could not be filled. Because of these things, he had repeatedly criticized Wang Jiating's capitalist thinking at meetings.
    And now? He thought to himself: "Now that the cooperative is rich, and I myself am rich, I think that the cooperative's wealth is our own wealth. I look down on other poor cooperatives, and I am unwilling to merge with them, unwilling to take the road of common prosperity, and say that people want to sponge off us. Isn't this attitude the same as the attitude of the well-to-do middle peasant Wang Jiating towards me?" Thinking and thinking, Hu Changbi kept blaming himself: "I really have the thinking of a well-to-do middle peasant! I really forgot my roots. The Party has educated me for so many years in vain."
    Hu Changbi's thinking gradually became clear. He criticized his own capitalist thinking at the meeting and resolved to take the road of communism.

    旭光人民公社的一场斗争
    本报记者　张碨
    鄂城旭光人民公社成立不久，就开了三天党员大会，有五百多名党员和积极分子参加。在这个会上，大家给公社副社长胡昌壁贴了三千四百多张大字报，其中有一张是这样写的：
    “人民公社成立了，万人欢喜你苦恼。
    你社富来别社穷，就怕自己吃亏了；
    一怕收入会减少，二怕机器往外调，
    三怕劳力抽跑了，四怕小社红旗倒。
    胡昌壁呀胡昌壁，今日大家劝告你：
    党员称号要牢记，错误思想要丢弃。”
    公社副社长胡昌壁原是旭光一社支部书记兼社主任。这个社在湖北省很出名，原来已有共公积累十六万七千九百多元，其中包括拖拉机、康拜因、车床各一台和抽水机五部。今年这个社跟邻近的旭光四社并为大社，他见四社的收入与积累跟他们差不多，也挺积极。但当8、9月间杜山、横山、临江、东港、新建、蒲团六个乡四十九个合作社的社员们要求以旭光一社为中心，成立旭光人民公社的时候，他看见有些社的生产、收入、积累都比他们差得远，他心里就嘀咕起来了：“这一下子几十个社合并起来一拉平，我们社的收入不减少了吗？”挺不乐意。
    一天，乡党委开会研究成立人民公社问题，他就在会上提出：“并是并，各社的公共积累可要并齐，不能搞的哪个社吃亏上当。”他这话刚一出口，各社的支部书记就感到他是在向大家示威：“我这富社只与富社并；与穷社并我就吃亏，吃亏的事情，我不干。”当时，旭光八社支部书记柯亨木以试探的口气说：“恐怕不应当是这样的吧？”胡昌壁马上瞪着眼睛，把桌子一拍：“我一部车床值七千多块，你们社里有什么？”
    在公社成立大会上胡昌壁也提出三个意见：第一，建立公社后的分配，要按各小社以往的收入、今年的收入和今年的支出进行分配。第二，小社的固定财产与各种机械的所有权属公社，但使用权应留原小社。第三，公社抽调劳动力，必须在满足小社的需要的情况下，再行抽调。
    县委第一书记石岗了解了这一情况，亲自找他谈话，批评他这种本位主义思想和富裕中农的思想。但他思想不通，在本位主义思想支配下，胡昌壁愁眉苦脸，对社里的什么事情都懒得理会。区队评比时，一贯获得大跃进红旗的旭光一社，降为先进红旗社（竞赛红旗分为大跃进、跃进、先进三种）。接着，先进红旗也被一贯比他们生产差的二大队（原旭光二社）夺去了。
    在胡昌壁的影响下，旭光一社的红旗真地倒下了。这是全社党员和社员的一件大事，于是，旭光人民公社党委，召开全体党员大会，从检查生产和讨论分配入手，开展大辩论。胡昌壁的思想就成了大家辩论的对象。原旭光一社的二十多个党员首先跟他算了一笔旭光一社是怎样富起来的账。
    “全社公共积累十六万七千九百四十元中，属于各单位赠送、国家下放或赊销给社里的物资机器等，共值九万三千七百五十元，占积累的55.73％，自己购置的只有七万四千一百八十六元，仅占公共积累的44.18％。社里资金困难时，国家及时贷款，乡里分配肥料时，分给一社的总是最多。在农忙时各机关学校还无报酬的支援劳动力四千八百二十个。”在会上，一个平时不爱讲话的胡凤英，批评胡昌壁说：“如果都像你，那谁还愿意送你那多机器？谁还肯白白支援你那多劳动力？这还不是因为人家有共产主义思想！”她接着又说：“我们社现在是富社了，可过去是不是富呢？我们刚办合作社的时候，富裕中农汪家庭他们嫌我们贫农穷，不和我们合伙。现在我们富了，你又以为穷社要揩我们的油。你这不是富裕中农思想是什么？你不要揭了疮疤忘了疼，要想想幸福生活是哪里来的呢！”有的人拿出办公社后生产大发展的事实问胡昌壁：“小社时，办一个高炉还抽不出人，办大社就抽了一万六千多人办钢铁，并且还办了养猪场，五所中学、六十八所小学，要不是几十个社合在一起成立人民公社，而按照你的意思只把几个富社并在一起，能有这多人，这大力量，办这大事业？”
    听了大家的批评，胡昌壁心情沉重起来了，他仔细想了想这个社的成长，想了想他自己怎样由贫农上升到中农生活的：
    旭光一社这个地方有三百七十八户，其中有二百五十九户是贫农，每亩地才产二、三十斤棉花。1953年胡昌壁他们由互助组转合作社时只有十九户，富裕中农汪家庭、谭丰茂这几家四硬（耕牛、农具、劳力、土地都强的意思）户，讽刺他们是“光蛋社”，不愿跟他们合伙，还神气十足的说：“我富是我自己富起来的。”那时政府为了解决他们贫农的困难，贷给他们四千元入社基金。1954年，他们合作社在战胜水灾中显示了巨大的优越性，汪家庭他们要求入社了，但在集股份基金的时候，又不愿把自己的新水车入社，还讽刺贫农是“老坑、老壋”填不满。为了这些事，他曾经在会上多次批评过汪家庭的资本主义思想。
    现在呢？他想着自己：“现在社富了，我自己也富了，我就以为社富是我们自己富起来的。我看不起别的穷社，不愿与人家合并，不愿走共同富裕的道路，说人家想揩自己的油。这种态度不是和富裕中农汪家庭对我的态度一样吗？”想着想着，胡昌壁不住的责备自己说：“我真是十足的富裕中农思想呀！我真是忘了本。党教育我这多年都白教育了。”
    胡昌壁的思想逐渐明朗了。他在会上批判了自己的资本主义思想，决心走共产主义的道路。
