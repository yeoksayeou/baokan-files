Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 10th. The Jiamusi Bathhouse has won the red flag of the national bathhouse industry for its good service attitude, good service quality, high labor efficiency, and low expenses. The Ministry of Commerce recently held a national bathhouse industry on-site conference in Jiamusi to promote the experience of more than a dozen bathhouses across the country, with the Jiamusi Bathhouse as the main example.

The service attitude of the Jiamusi Bathhouse makes customers feel as if they are at home. A railway worker could not scrub his back while bathing because of an arm injury. The attendant Duan Yongchun picked up a towel and soap to help him scrub. A young woman was upset and preparing to go back because her child was crying and she couldn't take a bath. The female attendant Sun Fengqin took the child for her so she could take a comfortable bath. The bathhouse staff also created more than a dozen tools such as foot-operated showers, automatic back scrubbers, and washing machines, and added more than 30 service items such as pre-sale of bath tickets and door-to-door ticket delivery, which greatly facilitated customers.

    商业部开浴池现场会议
    据新华社哈尔滨10日电　佳木斯浴池以服务态度好、服务质量好、劳动效率高、费用开支低，夺得了全国浴池业的红旗。商业部最近在佳木斯召开全国浴池业的现场会议，推广以佳木斯浴池为主的各地十几个浴池的经验。
    佳木斯浴池的服务态度使顾客感到亲如家人。一个铁路工人因为胳膊受过伤，洗澡时怎样也擦不到后背。服务员段永春就拿起毛巾、肥皂帮他擦洗。一个年轻妇女，因为孩子哭闹洗不成澡，懊丧地准备回去。女服务员孙凤琴就替她抱孩子，让她舒舒服服地洗了澡。浴池的职工还创造了脚踏淋浴、自动擦背器、洗衣机等十几种工具以及增加了预售澡票、送票到门等三十多种服务项目，给顾客很大方便。
