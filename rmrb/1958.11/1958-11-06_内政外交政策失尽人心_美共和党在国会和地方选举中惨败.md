Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Washington Report: Incomplete results from the US Congressional and local elections held on the 4th were revealed on the 5th. The ruling Republican Party suffered a crushing defeat in this election. The control of the upcoming Eighty-Sixth US Congress, which will convene in January next year, and the majority of state governments have fallen into the hands of the Democratic Party.

　　Voters Unenthusiastic
　　Half Didn't Vote

The voting results show that the broad masses of the American people are not enthusiastic about elections manipulated by the two major reactionary parties—the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Among the 105 million eligible voters in the United States, only more than 75 million registered to participate in the election. And only about 48 million people actually voted in this election.

　　Republican's Failure
　　Most Miserable in Over Twenty Years

According to American news agencies, the defeat suffered by the Republican Party in this biennial election is the most miserable in over twenty years. According to reports from these news agencies as of 10:00 PM on the 5th, if the results of Maine, which held its election earlier in September this year, are included, and Alaska, which will hold its election at the end of November, is excluded, then out of the four hundred and thirty-five seats in the House of Representatives, the Republican Party won only one hundred and thirty-two seats, the Democratic Party won two hundred and seventy-two seats, and the results of the other thirty-one seats are still pending; out of the thirty-four Senator seats up for re-election this time, the Republican Party won only eight seats, the Democratic Party won twenty-five seats, and the results of the other one seat are still pending; out of the thirty-three governorships up for re-election this time, the Republican Party won only seven seats, the Democratic Party won twenty-three seats, and the results of the other three seats are still pending. In this way, the proportion of seats held by the Republican Party in the Senate will decrease from slightly less than one-half to slightly more than one-third, it will only have about one-third of the seats in the House of Representatives, and less than one-third of the state governors will be Republicans.

Associated Press said in a news report on the 5th describing the miserable Republican defeat, "Across the country, Democratic candidates have driven out incumbent Republicans... This is the first time in more than a hundred years." The report said that even in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Eisenhower's hometown election district, a Democrat was elected to replace a Republican congressman.

　　Villain Nolan Loses
　　Nixon Suffers Setback

In California, the large western state, the Republican candidate for governor, William Knowland, the head of the US Congress "China Lobby" who is notorious for his insane hostility towards the Chinese people, also suffered a major defeat, and his opponent, Democrat Brown, won. After learning of the election results, Knowland said that he no longer intends to run for election and will go to Oakland to serve as the assistant publisher of the "Oakland Tribune."

The report also pointed out that in the same state of California, Republican Senatorial candidate Knight also suffered a major defeat. This unfavorable situation for the Republican Party has not occurred in California for sixteen years. The report said that the Republican Party's failure in California also means that US Vice President Nixon "suffered a top-level major political setback" because California is Nixon's "political home base."

　　Spent Large Sums of Money
　　Rockefeller Elected

The only consoling gain for the Republicans in this election was that Nelson Rockefeller, a major figure in the American oil tycoon Rockefeller family, who was running for Governor of New York, defeated Democratic candidate Harriman. During the campaign, Nelson spent huge sums of dollars to buy many bourgeois newspapers to support him.

News from Taipei said that the Republican Party's defeat caused "disappointment" among the Chiang Kai-shek clique, because they reportedly did not expect so many of their "closest friends," especially Senator Knowland, to suffer such a failure.

　　Policies Repulsive
　　Republican Party Spurned

What does the Republican Party's failure illustrate? It shows that the Republican government's actions are very unpopular domestically. The broad masses of American voters loathe the Republican government's domestic and foreign policies, especially its foreign policy, and therefore, they abandoned the Republican candidates in the voting.

In 1952, Republican presidential candidate Eisenhower was elected. The Republican Party replaced the Democratic Party in power. The banner raised by the Republican Party during the election at that time was: "Peace and Prosperity." The record of six years in power has completely exposed this deceptive guise. The Republican government not only inherited the original Democratic government's set of foreign aggression and war policies, but also intensified playing Dulles's proclaimed brinkmanship game. In the recent short period of just over four months, the US government has twice pushed the world to the brink of war over the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait.

The Republican Party was also aware in advance of the serious failure and unpopularity of the US government's foreign policy. Therefore, the Republicans waged a frantic struggle in the election campaign. Eisenhower, in his frail and ailing body, also personally went out to campaign for the Republican Party from the East Coast to the West Coast. The Republican government tried its best to avoid discussing foreign policy in the election campaign, especially the Far East policy that had aroused widespread condemnation at home and abroad. However, the situation caused by the Republican government's fire-playing policy was so serious, and the worries and dissatisfaction it aroused in domestic public opinion were so profound and widespread, that the Republican Party was completely unable to escape this issue, and the Democrats did not give up this good opportunity to attack their opponents.

　　Ruling Group's Policies
　　Will Not Have Major Changes

It should be pointed out that the results of this congressional and local election will not cause any major changes in the policies of the American rulers. Although the Democratic Party's power has been strengthened in Congress, the government machinery will continue to be in the hands of the Republican Party for the next two years, and the two parties have never had any essential differences in foreign and domestic policies.

But the overriding fact is: the Republican Party's unprecedented failure reflects the serious failure and crisis of US domestic and foreign policies, and reflects the extreme dissatisfaction, "distress," and "anger" of voters with these policies, as US newspapers have said. The continued implementation of this policy of aggression and expansion abroad, playing "brinkmanship," and exploitation and deepening economic crises at home is destined to lead to greater failure and an even worse predicament. This is a problem that neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party can absolutely avoid.

    内政外交政策失尽人心
    美共和党在国会和地方选举中惨败
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：华盛顿消息：在4日举行的美国国会和地方选举的不完全结果5日已经揭晓，执政的共和党在这次选举中遭到了惨败。将于明年1月开幕的美国第八十六届国会和绝大多数州的控制权落入民主党手中。
    选民毫不热心
    一半人没投票
    投票结果表明，美国广大人民对于由两大反动政党——共和党和民主党操纵的选举并不热心。在美国一亿零五百万有选举权的选民中，登记参加选举的只有七千五百多万人。而在这次选举中实际参加投票的只有四千八百万人左右。
    共和党的失败
    二十多年来最惨
    据美国通讯社说，在这个两年一度的选举中，共和党遭到的挫败是二十多年来最惨的。据这些通讯社截至5日下午十时的报道，如果把在今年9月已先期举行选举的缅因州的结果包括在内，而把要到11月底才举行选举的阿拉斯加州除外，那么在众议院的四百三十五个席位中，共和党只赢得一百三十二席，民主党赢得了二百七十二席，另外三十一席尚未有结果；在这次改选的三十四个参议员席位中，共和党只赢得八席，民主党赢得了二十五席，另外一席尚未有结果；在这次改选的三十三个州长席位中，共和党只赢得七席，民主党取得二十三席，另外三席尚未有结果。这样共和党今后在参议院中所占的席位的比例将由二分之一弱减到三分之一强，在众议院中将只拥有三分之一左右的席位，而在各州州长中也将只有不到三分之一是共和党人。
    美联社在5日一条描写共和党失败之惨的消息中说，“在全国各地，民主党的候选人纷纷赶走了执政的共和党人……这在一百多年来还是第一次”。消息说，甚至在艾森豪威尔的老家宾夕法尼亚州葛底斯堡选区，也选出了一个民主党人来代替一个共和党的众议员。
    坏蛋诺兰落选
    尼克松遭挫折
    在美国西部的大州加利福尼亚，共和党的州长候选人、以疯狂敌视中国人民而臭名远扬的美国国会“院外援华集团”的首脑人物威廉·诺兰也遭到大败，他的对手民主党人布朗获胜。诺兰在得悉选举结果后说，他以后不再打算进行竞选了，他将要到奥克兰去出任“奥克兰论坛报”的助理发行人。
    消息还指出，在同一个加利福尼亚州，共和党的参议员候选人奈特也大败，这种不利于共和党的情况是加利福尼亚州十六年来从未有过的。消息说，共和党在加利福尼亚州的失败也意味着美国副总统尼克松“遭到头等重大的政治挫折”，因为加利福尼亚是尼克松“政治活动的老家”。
    花了大量钞票
    洛克菲勒当选
    共和党人在这次选举中唯一的一点聊以自慰的收获是竞选纽约州州长的纳尔逊·洛克菲勒——美国石油大王洛克菲勒家族的主要人物击败了民主党候选人哈里曼。在竞选过程，纳尔逊花费了巨额美元，收买许多资产阶级报纸来支持他。
    来自台北的消息说，共和党的失败在蒋介石集团人士中引起“失望”，因为据说他们没有预料到他们这么多的“最密切的朋友”，特别是参议员诺兰遭到这样的失败。
    政策令人厌恶
    共和党被唾弃
    共和党的失败说明了什么呢？它说明，共和党政府的作为在国内十分不得人心。美国广大投票选民厌恶共和党政府的对内对外政策，特别是它的对外政策，因此，他们在投票中抛弃了共和党的候选人。
    在1952年的时候，共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔当选。共和党取代民主党而执政。共和党当时在竞选中打出的旗号是：“和平和繁荣”。六年来的执政纪录，完全揭穿了这个骗人幌子。共和党政府不仅继承了原来民主党政府的一套对外侵略和战争政策，而且加紧玩弄着杜勒斯宣扬的战争边缘把戏。在最近短短的四个多月里，美国政府就中东和台湾海峡两度把世界推向战争边缘。
    共和党对于美国政府外交政策的严重失败及其不得人心事先也是知道的。因此，共和党人在竞选中曾进行狂热的挣扎。艾森豪威尔以衰病之身，也亲自出马，从东海岸到西海岸，为共和党奔走呼号。共和党政府竭力避免在竞选运动中讨论外交政策，特别是在国内外引起广泛谴责的远东政策。但是，共和党政府的玩火政策所引起的局势是这样严重，在国内舆论中引起的忧虑和不满是这样深刻和广泛，结果共和党就完全无法逃避这方面的问题，民主党人也并没有放弃这种打击对手的良机。
    统治集团政策
    不会有大改变
    应当指出，这次国会和地方选举的结果并不会使美国统治者的政策有什么重大改变。尽管民主党势力在国会中加强，未来两年中政府机器将继续掌握在共和党手中，而两党在外交内政政策上从来都没有什么本质的区别。
    但是压倒一切的事实是：共和党空前的失败反映了美国国内外政策的严重失败和危机，反映了美国报纸所说的选民们对这种政策的极端不满，“苦恼”和“愤怒”。这种对外实行侵略扩张，玩弄“战争边缘”，对内实行巧取豪夺、加深经济危机的政策继续推行下去，注定了要陷于更大的失败和更糟的绝境。这是不论共和党或民主党都绝对回避不了的问题。
