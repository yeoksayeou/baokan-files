Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 24th. The International Preparatory Committee Meeting of the Asian-African Youth Conference opened here this morning with the participation of thirty-seven Asian and African countries.

　　President Anwar Sadat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference said in his opening speech today that most of the countries participating in the meeting have finally shaken off the shackles of imperialist rule, but the people of some other Asian and African countries are still under imperialist rule. He said that representatives from these countries are also participating in this meeting, "which is one of the reasons why we are holding this meeting, and it is also one of the reasons why we will continue to hold meetings until all our brothers regain their freedom." He said: "We will continue our efforts until they are free."

　　In his speech, Sadat emphasized the increasingly strengthened solidarity and friendship of the peace-loving Asian and African people in their efforts to achieve lasting peace. He recalled the previous Bandung Conference and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo, as well as the establishment of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council. He said that this is clear evidence that we are determined to stop imperialism, end imperialism's ruthless and brutal rule, and defend peace.

　　Sadat also said that imperialism hates the Asian-African Youth Conference and other Asian-African people's conferences, and they will do everything possible to undermine the efforts of the Asian-African people to make the conference a success. However, he said he believed that regardless of the attempts of imperialism, the conference would be a success.

　　Hussein, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Youth Welfare of the United Arab Republic and Minister of Education of the UAR, praised the principles formulated at the conferences in Bandung, Cairo, and Accra in his speech to the meeting, and he emphasized the role of youth in strengthening these principles.

　　Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, Seba'i, called on Asian and African youth to strengthen unity in all aspects of life, seek solutions to common problems together, and cooperate in all aspects, so that "we can eliminate all attempts by imperialism to exploit us."

　　After the representatives spoke, Hussein, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Youth Welfare of the United Arab Republic, was elected Honorary Chairman of the International Preparatory Committee of the Asian-African Youth Conference, and Seba'i was elected Chairman.

　　Four representatives from India, China, Kenya, and Cameroon were elected Vice-Chairmen.

　　Abdel Khaleq Allam, the representative of the United Arab Republic, was elected Secretary-General of the International Preparatory Committee.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 24th. Secretary-General of the Standing Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, Seba'i, said at a press conference held here yesterday that so far, seventy-two representatives of youth organizations from thirty-seven Asian and African countries have accepted the invitation to attend the International Preparatory Committee Meeting of the Asian-African Youth Conference.
