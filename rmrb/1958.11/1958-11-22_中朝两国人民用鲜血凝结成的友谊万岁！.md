    Long Live the Friendship Forged in Blood by the Peoples of China and Korea!
    Li Dequan, President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association
    Today, the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, is coming to our country for a friendly visit, bringing with them the deep friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese people. On behalf of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, I would like to express my warm welcome and highest respect to Premier Kim Il-sung, the leader of the heroic Korean people, and all members of the delegation.
    China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are close neighbors, and the Chinese and Korean peoples are the closest friends and brothers. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples is forged in blood. For a long time, our two peoples have fought side by side and advanced together in the struggle against common enemies. In the Chinese people's revolutionary wars and during the Anti-Japanese War, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people spared no effort to sacrifice their lives to support the Chinese people. When American imperialism ignited the flames of war in Korea and threatened China's security, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people also formed the Volunteer Army, crossed the Yalu River, and rushed to the Korean front to fight alongside the heroic Korean People's Army in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. This struggle lasted for four years, from 1950 to 1953. Because this war was a war against the barbaric aggression of the United States, a great and just war, it finally ended with our great victory and the crushing defeat of the American aggressors. It proved to the people of the world that the people who have been liberated, have their own working-class political party leading them, and are advancing along the socialist road, are forever invincible. At the same time, it also revealed to the people of the world that the seemingly powerful American imperialist aggressor army is essentially a paper tiger. Any country and nation that is oppressed and invaded, as long as it dares to resolutely fight against it, will surely be able to defeat it. The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fought side by side on the Korean battlefield and defeated the American imperialist aggressor army, which is a glorious example. During the years when the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army jointly fought back against the American aggressor army, the Korean people gave great support and care to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The spirit of unyielding perseverance shown by the heroic Korean people in the most difficult days when their hometowns were bombed into ruins, in the face of the enemy's inhumane burning and killing, inspired us, and inspired every soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    In early 1952, the Chinese Red Cross sent me to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to lead an investigation team. I personally witnessed the heinous crimes of the American aggressor army: they were carrying out inhumane germ warfare, bombing countless peaceful towns and villages into ruins, and turning ancient buildings into rubble. Under the burning and killing of heavy bombs and napalm bombs, many women and children tragically lost their lives, many children lost their parents, and many parents lost their children. But all this did not frighten the heroic Korean people. On the contrary, under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean people more heroically and tenaciously resisted the aggressors, and finally defeated the American aggressor army, burned this paper tiger, and achieved a great victory.
    Although the American aggressors suffered a crushing defeat and were forced to cease fire, they still insisted on their policy of aggression against Korea, obstructed the peaceful reunification of Korea, and continuously violated the armistice agreement, threatening peace in Korea and the Far East. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly put forward just proposals for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, which have not only received the consistent support of the Chinese people and our government, but also the active support of all peace-loving countries and people in the world. In order to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea and ease the tense situation in the Far East, our Volunteer Army had already withdrawn nineteen divisions from Korea in three batches from September 1954 to October 1955. The remaining Volunteer Army was also completely withdrawn to the motherland at the end of October this year. The withdrawal of our Volunteer Army from Korea is not only a major contribution to the peaceful reunification of Korea and the easing of the international situation, but also demonstrates the strength of the socialist camp. We believe that the three thousand miles of Korean rivers and mountains will surely be unified, and the thirty million compatriots in the North and South will surely be reunited. All the sabotage conspiracies of imperialism will eventually be completely defeated.
    During the period of peaceful reconstruction, the Korean people are carrying out large-scale socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and Premier Kim Il-sung, they have mounted the Chollima (Thousand-Li Horse) and are galloping forward along the road of socialism. Last year, the total industrial output value of northern Korea had increased to 2.8 times that of the pre-war year of 1949, and in the first nine months of this year, it increased by 34% compared to the same period last year. Agriculture in Korea has been fully collectivized, and despite a severe drought this year, it still achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The heroic Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been rebuilt from the ruins and stands as a stronger force on the eastern frontier of the socialist camp. Our people have always consistently cared for and supported the peaceful construction of the heroic Korean people, and we regard the construction achievements of our brotherly Korean people as our own achievements.
    Our people's struggle for socialist construction and against the American imperialists' occupation of our territory of Taiwan has also received the full support of our brotherly Korean people. The cooperation and mutual support between the Chinese and Korean peoples in various fields vividly proves that the friendship forged in blood between the Chinese and Korean peoples is unbreakable and will continue to develop.
    The fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Korea, which has a long history, has reached an unprecedented level of development in the days of the common struggle against American aggression. Under the glorious light of the banner of Marxism-Leninism, this flesh-and-blood, sharing-weal-and-woe friendship, forged like a rock by the blood shed together in fighting side-by-side against the enemy and the hot sweat shed together in common labor, embodies the most sublime spirit of proletarian internationalist unity and friendship. Relying on this unity and friendship, our two peoples have achieved a great victory against American imperialist aggression in the past; similarly, relying on this unity and friendship, our two peoples will surely be able to jointly achieve incomparably glorious victories in the great cause of socialist construction. We believe that the internationalist friendship, solidarity, and cooperation characterized by mutual assistance and affection between Korea and China, and among all socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, will surely spread to all mankind! The common enemy of the people of the world, the American imperialists, who have occupied our Taiwan and the southern part of Korea and have done all kinds of evil, will ultimately be sentenced to death by hanging in the face of the great united strength of the peace-loving people of all countries.
    As we warmly welcome our distinguished Korean guests with excitement today, let us raise our arms and shout: Long live the unbreakable friendship forged in blood by the peoples of China and Korea! Long live the great unity and consolidation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    中朝两国人民用鲜血凝结成的友谊万岁！
    中朝友好协会会长　李德全
    今天以金日成首相为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团，带着朝鲜人民对中国人民深厚的友情，前来我国进行友好访问，我谨代表中朝友好协会，向英雄的朝鲜人民的领袖金日成首相及代表团全体成员表示热诚的欢迎和致以崇高的敬意。
    中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是亲邻，中国人民和朝鲜人民是最亲密的朋友和兄弟。中朝两国人民的友谊是用鲜血凝成的。长期以来，我们两国人民就在反抗共同敌人的斗争中并肩作战，共同前进。在中国人民历次革命战争中和抗日战争时期，朝鲜人民的优秀儿女不惜牺牲生命支援中国人民。当美帝国主义在朝鲜燃起战火，并且威胁中国安全的时候，中国人民的优秀儿女也组成了志愿军，跨过鸭绿江，奔向朝鲜前线，与英勇的朝鲜人民军并肩作战，进行抗美援朝、保家卫国的斗争。这个斗争由1950年到1953年进行了四个年头。由于这个战争是反抗美国野蛮侵略的战争，是一次伟大的正义战争，它终于以我们的伟大胜利、美国侵略者的惨重失败而告终。它向全世界人民证明：解放了的、有了自己的工人阶级政党领导的、沿着社会主义道路迈进的人民，永远是不可战胜的。同时它也向全世界人民揭露：貌似强大的美帝国主义侵略军，实质上是一只纸老虎，任何受压迫受侵略的国家和民族，只要敢于坚决地同它进行斗争，就一定可以把它打败。英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜战场上并肩作战，打败了美帝国主义的侵略军，就是一个光辉的范例。在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军共同反击美国侵略军的年月里，朝鲜人民给予中国人民志愿军以极大的支援和关怀。英雄的朝鲜人民在家乡被炸成废墟的最艰难的日子里，在敌人惨无人道的烧杀面前所表现的那种坚贞不屈的精神激励着我们，激励着中国人民志愿军的每个战士。
    1952年初，中国红十字会曾派我带领调查团到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，我亲眼看到美国侵略军的万恶罪行：他们在进行惨无人道的细菌战，并将无数的和平城镇和村庄炸成一片废墟，把古老的建筑物也炸成了一片瓦砾场，在重磅炸弹和凝固汽油弹的烧杀下，很多妇女儿童悲惨地失去了生命，多少孩子失去了父母，多少父母失去了儿女。但所有这一切，并没有吓倒英雄的朝鲜人民，相反的，朝鲜人民在金日成首相和朝鲜劳动党的领导下，更加英勇顽强地抗击侵略者，最后，终于打败了美国侵略军，烧毁了这只纸老虎，取得了伟大的胜利。
    美国侵略者虽然惨遭失败而被迫停战，但是它仍坚持对朝鲜的侵略政策，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，并不断破坏停战协定，威胁朝鲜和远东的和平。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾屡次提出和平统一祖国的正当主张，这些主张不仅获得中国人民和我国政府的一贯支持，而且也获得了世界一切爱好和平国家和人民的积极支持。为了促进朝鲜人民和平统一祖国和缓和远东紧张局势，我国志愿军早在1954年9月到1955年10月，就已先后分三批从朝鲜撤出了十九个师。其余的志愿军又于今年10月底全部撤回祖国。我国志愿军的撤出朝鲜，不仅是对和平统一朝鲜和缓和国际局势的重大贡献，而且也显示了社会主义阵营力量的强大。我们相信，朝鲜的三千里江山，一定能够统一，南北的三千万同胞，一定能够团聚。帝国主义的一切破坏阴谋终将会遭到彻底失败。
    朝鲜人民在和平恢复时期，进行着大规模的社会主义建设。他们在劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相的领导下，跨上了千里马，沿着社会主义的道路奔腾前进。去年朝鲜北部的工业总产值已经增加到战前1949年的二点八倍，而今年头九个月又比去年同期增加了34％。朝鲜的农业已经全部实现了合作化，今年虽逢大旱，但是仍然获得了空前丰收。英雄的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，已经从废墟上重建起来，以更强大的姿态屹立在社会主义阵营的东方前哨。我国人民始终一贯地关心和支持英雄的朝鲜人民的和平建设，我们把兄弟朝鲜人民的建设成就，看成是我们自己的成就。
    我国人民在社会主义建设和反对美帝国主义霸占我国领土台湾的斗争，也同样地得到了兄弟朝鲜人民的全力支持，中朝两国人民在各方面的合作和互相支持，生动地证明了中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的友谊牢不可破，并将日益发展起来。
    有着悠久历史的中朝两国人民之间兄弟般的友谊，在反抗美国侵略的共同斗争的日子里，得到了从未有过的高度发展。在马克思列宁主义旗帜的光辉照耀下，经过并肩杀敌时流在一起的鲜血和共同劳动中流在一起的热汗所灌溉的，磐石般凝结起来的这种骨肉相依、患难与共的友谊，体现了人世间最崇高的无产阶级国际主义的团结友爱精神。依靠这种团结和友谊，我们两国人民过去取得了反抗美帝国主义侵略的伟大胜利；同样，依靠这种团结和友谊，我们两国人民在伟大的社会主义建设事业中，也一定能够共同获得无比辉煌的胜利。我们相信：在朝鲜和中国之间、在以苏联为首的各社会主义国家之间互助合作、相爱无间的国际主义友好团结关系，必将普及到全人类！霸占着我国的台湾和朝鲜的南部、做尽了一切坏事的全世界人民的公敌——美帝国主义，在世界各国爱好和平的人民伟大的团结力量面前，必将最后被处以绞刑。
    当我们怀着兴奋的心情热烈欢迎我们的朝鲜贵宾的今天，让我们振臂高呼：中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的牢不可破的友谊万岁！以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结和巩固万岁！
