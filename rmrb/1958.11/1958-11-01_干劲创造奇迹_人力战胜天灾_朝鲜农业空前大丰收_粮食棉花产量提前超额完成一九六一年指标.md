Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 30th: North Korea's agriculture has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year.

According to statistics from the North Korean Ministry of Agriculture, this year's grain production will reach 3.9 million tons, an increase of 700,000 tons compared to last year, exceeding the first Five-Year Plan's final year (1961) target of increasing grain production to 3.76 million tons three years ahead of schedule. This year, North Korea's ginned cotton production will reach 60,000 tons, a tenfold increase compared to last year, exceeding the 1961 planned production by 100%.

This year's bumper harvest in North Korea was achieved through the collective strength of North Korean farmers after the complete collectivization of agriculture, and it was achieved by North Korean farmers, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, using human power to overcome natural disasters. In the first eight months of this year, North Korea's weather was particularly dry, with only half the normal rainfall. Especially in May and June, during the sowing, transplanting, and crop growth periods, most areas of northern North Korea did not receive rain. Farmers, students, soldiers, and cadres from all over the country formed a large drought resistance army and worked hard for more than twenty days and nights, finally overcoming the drought.

North Korean farmers have comprehensively promoted advanced technologies such as "cold storage seedling cultivation" and "nutritional soil transplanting" in rice and cotton planting, which has become an important factor in this year's agricultural production increase. Due to the farmers' bold innovations in agricultural cultivation techniques and intensive farming, high-yield "satellites" have appeared in various crops. For example, the yield of two chongbo (approximately fifteen mu per chongbo) of rice in the Yonan Agricultural Cooperative in Yonan County, South Hwanghae Province, reached 110 tons, an average of 55 tons per chongbo. The yield of five chongbo of corn in the Samryong Agricultural Cooperative in Sunan County averaged 15 tons per chongbo. Half a chongbo of cotton field in the Songjong Agricultural Cooperative in Gusan County produced 5.75 tons of ginned cotton. This is an increase of two to four times compared to the highest unit area yield of these crops last year.

Encouraged by this year's bumper harvest, North Korean farmers are responding to the call of the Workers' Party of Korea to strive to increase grain production to 7 million tons within one or two years.

Now the autumn harvest has been completed, and winter wheat has also been sown. Farmers have broken with the past view that wheat yields are low, and have sown more than 160,000 chongbo of winter wheat, an increase of 60,000 chongbo compared to last year. They have also applied more fertilizer and practiced close planting. The Wonsa Agricultural Cooperative in Ongjin County plans to harvest 100 tons (equivalent to more than 10,000 jin per mu) on a one-chongbo wheat experimental field. Choi Kyung-seok, the chairman of the Doyoung Agricultural Cooperative in Gangnam County, told Xinhua News Agency reporters that the high-yield records created by Chinese farmers have greatly encouraged North Korean farmers. The average yield of rice in this cooperative this year is 15 tons per chongbo, and the members are determined to increase the rice yield more than threefold next year, reaching 50 tons per chongbo. Choi Kyung-seok, the chairman of the cooperative, plans to produce 250 tons of rice (equivalent to 34,000 jin per mu) in the one-chongbo experimental field that he directly participates in cultivating.

    干劲创造奇迹  人力战胜天灾
    朝鲜农业空前大丰收
    粮食棉花产量提前超额完成一九六一年指标
    新华社平壤30日电　朝鲜北部今年农业获得史无前例的丰收。
    据朝鲜农业省的统计，今年的粮食产量可达三百九十万吨，比去年增产了七十万吨，提前三年超额完成了第一个五年计划最后一年（1961年）增产到三百七十六万吨粮食的指标。今年朝鲜的籽棉产量可达六万吨，跃增为去年的十倍，超过1961年的计划产量的一倍。
    今年朝鲜的大丰收，是朝鲜农民全部完成了合作化以后用集体的力量取得的，是朝鲜农民在劳动党的领导下，以人力战胜天灾而取得的。今年头八个月，朝鲜天气特别干旱，雨量只有常年的一半。特别是5、6月间，正值播种插秧和农作物生长的时候，朝鲜北部大部分地区没有下雨，各地的农民、学生、军队和干部组成了抗旱大军，苦战二十多个昼夜，终于战胜了干旱。
    朝鲜农民在水稻和棉花的种植中，全面推广了“冷藏育苗法”和“营养坛假植法”等先进技术，这成为今年农业增产的一个重要因素。由于农民们大胆革新农业栽培技术，精耕细作，各种作物都出现了高产“卫星”。如黄海南道延安郡延安农业社的两町步（每町步约合十五亩）水稻的产量达到一百一十吨，平均每町步五十五吨。顺安郡三龙农业社的五町步玉蜀黍产量平均每町步十五吨。龟城郡松亭农业社的半町步棉田产籽棉五点七五吨。这比去年这些作物的最高单位面积产量分别增加两倍到四倍。
    朝鲜农民在今年大丰收的鼓舞下，响应朝鲜劳动党的号召，争取在一两年内使粮食产量达到七百万吨。
    现在秋收已经全部结束，冬小麦也已经播种完毕。农民们打破了过去小麦低产的看法，共播下了十六万多町步的冬小麦，比去年增加了六万町步。他们还多施肥料，实行密植。瓮津郡元舍农业社计划在一町步的小麦试验田上收一百吨（合亩产一万多斤）。江南郡斗岩农业社的社长崔景锡对新华社记者说，中国农民创造的丰产纪录，大大地鼓舞了朝鲜农民。这个社今年的水稻平均产量每町步十五吨，社员们决心要使明年水稻产量跃增三倍多，达到每町步五十吨。这个社的社长崔景锡计划在他直接参加耕种的一町步大的试验田里生产二百五十吨稻谷（合亩产三万四千斤）。
