    Deeply Moved
    After reading the news about the volunteer soldiers and officers paying respects to the Chinese and North Korean martyrs published on the fifth page of your newspaper on October 22nd, I learned that Chairman Mao's eldest son, Comrade Mao Anying, also sacrificed himself in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. This matter moves me deeply. Martyr Mao Anying joined the volunteer army to go to Korea in 1950. In that most dangerous time, Chairman Mao sent his own son to the front line, on the one hand, setting an example, and on the other hand, expressing his determination to resist US aggression and aid Korea. This noble spirit of self-sacrifice and internationalism is, in the eyes of our great leader, a very natural and ordinary thing; but for us, it is such a profound education! If our state functionaries are still calculating personal interests, they are not worthy of being citizens of the Mao Zedong era.

    使我万分感动
    读了你报10月22日第五版登载的志愿军官兵祭别中朝烈士的消息，我才知道毛主席的长子毛岸英同志也在抗美援朝战争中牺牲了。这事使我万分感动。毛岸英烈士参加志愿军赴朝，是在1950年。在那最危险的时候，毛主席就把自己的亲生儿子送到前线去，一方面起了带头作用，一方面表示抗美援朝的决心。这种崇高的自我牺牲和国际主义的精神，在我们伟大的领袖看来，是很自然、很平凡的事；但对我们来说，是多么深刻的教育啊！我们国家工作人员，如果再斤斤计较个人的利益，便不配做毛泽东时代的公民了。
