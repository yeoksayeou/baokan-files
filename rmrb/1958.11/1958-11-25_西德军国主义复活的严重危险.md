    The Grave Danger of the Revival of West German Militarism
    By Xi Linsheng
    Recently, the government of the German Democratic Republic issued a memorandum regarding the threat to peace posed by the policy of arming West Germany, and a white paper regarding the aggressive policies of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. These documents use powerful facts to tell the people of the world: Today, West Germany is following the old path of Hitler's Germany. Countless facts have proven that the Potsdam Agreement, for which millions of people bled and sacrificed during World War II, has been most severely undermined in West Germany. With the help and support of the United States, a new militaristic Germany has been revived on the territory of western Germany.

    Evil Spirits Re-ascend the "Throne"
    In order to eradicate the economic foundations of the German militarist forces, the Potsdam Agreement clearly stipulated: The German economy shall be decentralized as rapidly as possible in order to eliminate the excessive concentration of economic power formed by cartels, syndicates, trusts and other monopoly agreements. However, for thirteen years, West Germany, at the instigation of the United States and other Western countries, has taken a completely different path. At present, the concentration of capital in West Germany is even greater than before the war. In 1958, large companies controlled 62.5% of share capital, compared to 37.1% in 1938. Among them, seventeen monopoly groups control approximately 80% of West Germany's total share capital. Nine steel concerns monopolize 93.9% of metallurgical industrial production, 99.9% of iron ore mining, 69.9% of coal mining, and 75.2% of coke production. In terms of financial capital, the three largest monopoly banks of the former German Reich: Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, and Commerzbank own 60% of West Germany's total bank assets, more than double the total capital in pre-war years.

    The U.S. News & World Report once wrote: "Most of the bosses in the Ruhr today are figures who thrived in the Hitler era." This is indeed the case. For example, the Krupp family, the arms king, has been making fortunes by manufacturing weapons of death for over a century. During the Franco-Prussian War, it sold breech-loading cannons to Prussia and France; during World War I, it sold the "Big Bertha" long-range cannons to the German Reich; during World War II, it manufactured "Tiger" tanks and submarines for Hitler to carry out aggressive wars. At the end of World War II, Krupp, such a major war criminal, was only sentenced to twelve years in prison. However, after being imprisoned for less than three years, he was released by the U.S. occupation authorities in 1951, and the United States then returned his property to him. Today, Krupp has once again become a monopoly empire with nearly seventy huge enterprises and assets of three billion marks. His steel plant produces 3.5 million tons of steel annually. He is expanding all over the world and is actively preparing to manufacture atomic weapons. Another example is the Farben chemical concern, which supplied 80% of all explosives and 70% of shells to Hitler's army during World War II. It also manufactured poison gas for the Nazis to slaughter people in concentration camps. But now it has become one of the world's largest chemical companies, controlling 70% of the share capital of West Germany's chemical industry and accounting for 85% of German chemical products. Those leaders of the Farben concern in the past have also long since walked out of prison and re-ascended to the seats of managers and directors.

      Nazi Criminals Make a Comeback
    The Potsdam Agreement also explicitly stipulated: War criminals and persons who caused atrocities or war crimes must be arrested and brought to trial. But in reality, the prisons in which the Western occupying powers detained Nazi war criminals are now empty. Of the thousands of war criminals in the early post-war period, only a few remain today. Even these few remaining war criminals will be released soon. Now many Nazi criminals have once again become the darlings of the West German Adenauer government. In the current government institutions, more than 180,000 officials and employees once held the same positions under Hitler. For example, among the seventeen ministers in the West German government, eight were heads of the Hitler SS and officials of the Nazi government. In the federal judicial system, six hundred Nazi judges occupy important positions. These Nazi Party members are resuming their old trades. Like former SS head and current Interior Minister Schröder, who planned atrocities such as banning the Communist Party and declaring many democratic organizations illegal, he is now preparing to announce a "state of national emergency" decree to suppress strikes and demonstrations against atomic armament policies.

      Aggressive Nature Remains Unchanged
    While restoring economic and political power, German militarists are also making every effort to restore their military power. West German Chancellor Adenauer, Defense Minister Strauss, Foreign Minister von Brentano, and many West German generals do not conceal their aim in rebuilding the army: to launch revanchist wars and seize European hegemony. Adenauer once stated: With German divisions, it would be possible to "attack eastward when possible." On November 19, Strauss openly clamored at the North Atlantic Assembly that the mission of the West German navy was to prepare for war with the Soviet Union. West German Foreign Minister von Brentano openly proposed restoring Germany's borders of 1937. Recently, the Chiefs of Staff of the West German Army, Navy, and Air Force, Heusinger, said even more bluntly that the West German army today faces the same tasks as the German Wehrmacht in 1939. In fact, the West German army today has already held many atomic war exercises against the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and other socialist countries as hypothetical enemies.

    However, the ambitions of West German militarists are not only directed at the East, their spearheads are also pointed at the West. For example, Heusinger once clamored: "When we have fifteen divisions, we will speak to the French in a different tone." And Arnold, the acting chairman of Adenauer's party, openly threatened the Dutch government to immediately abandon a narrow strip of land near West German territory that it acquired during World War II.

    The rearmament of West Germany is entirely the work of the United States. The United States has long intended to turn West Germany into a European assault force to provoke a new war. Therefore, after the United States divided Germany, it actively rebuilt the West German army. After several years of support from the United States, West Germany has now established a Bundeswehr with 175,000 soldiers. Among them, 37,000 are in the air force and 17,000 are in the navy. The navy has more than one hundred warships. The air force is also ordering aircraft in large quantities. According to reports, by 1963, West Germany will have more than 1,300 aircraft. The entire Bundeswehr will reach 350,000 in the early 1960s. Currently, American generals are openly clamoring to make West German armed forces become "a major part of the Atlantic Pact armed forces." The Nazi generals Speidel and Foertsch of West Germany have also become the Commander of Allied Land Forces Central Europe and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, respectively. But West German militarists are not satisfied with this. Recently, they have been clamoring to establish a unified command for Central and Northern Europe, placing the military forces of Denmark and Norway under the command of Central European Commander Speidel.

    The Original Crew, New Weapons
    This newly established West German Bundeswehr is in many ways identical to Hitler's Wehrmacht. This is not surprising, because many senior officers in this new Bundeswehr are old members of the Wehrmacht. Currently, 215 Hitler officers hold leadership positions in the West German army. For example, General Speidel, who used to be the chief of staff of Hitler's general staff in France, not only occupied France and massacred French patriots, but also adopted the so-called "scorched earth" policy in Soviet Ukraine. The current Chief of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Heusinger, was also the Minister of Operations of Hitler's General Staff, and helped Hitler plan World War II. Kilmansegg, the current West German liaison officer to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was a major in the staff of Hitler's armored division. In 1941, he clamored arrogantly to "eliminate Poland from history." The West German Navy Commander Ruge was a Nazi admiral who led the attack on Poland. Now he is asking the West German Navy to prepare for combat and harass the Soviet Union's maritime supply lines. It can be seen that the ferocity of these Nazi executioners has not diminished.

    Currently, the United States and West German militarists are making every effort to equip this new Bundeswehr with atomic weapons. In March of this year, the West German Bundestag officially passed a resolution to equip the West German army with atomic weapons. Recently, a spokesman for the West German Ministry of Defense announced: The United States will provide West Germany with twenty-four "Honest John" rockets that can be equipped with nuclear warheads and two rocket launchers before the end of the year. The personnel who will operate the rockets are also receiving training in the use of atomic weapons in the United States. Not only that, the West German military industry is also engaged in research on the manufacture of rockets and atomic weapons. In some armaments factories in Bonn, Hanover, and Stuttgart, materials for missiles and rockets are being produced. Through cooperation with France, the Franco-German Missile Research Institute was established in Saint-Louis, Alsace, and they are jointly testing missile launches in Colomb-Béchar, Algeria. In terms of atomic weapons, West German Defense Minister Strauss has publicly stated that in three to five years, West Germany will produce nuclear weapons itself, regardless of the provisions of the Paris Agreement. Obviously, when the ferocious German militarists get their hands on atomic weapons, their aggressive ambitions will be even greater. This is a serious threat to peace in Europe and the world.

    The Occupation of Berlin Must End
    The active revival of German militarism by the United States and the West German government has completely destroyed the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement, and the only thing that remains is the system of occupation of West Berlin by Western countries, which is implemented in accordance with this spirit. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. The fact is obvious that since the United States and Britain, France, and the West German government have already brutally trampled on the Potsdam Agreement, then the legal basis for their occupation of West Berlin has been completely lost. Therefore, the recent proposal by Soviet Premier Khrushchev, supported by the government of the German Democratic Republic, to end the remnants of the occupation regime in Berlin is completely reasonable and welcomed by the broad masses of the German people. But now Western countries are using so-called "occupation rights" and "sacred obligations to administer West Berlin" to justify their occupation of West Berlin. But one cannot help but ask, what is this so-called "sacred obligation to administer West Berlin"? Does it not precisely mean eradicating German militarism and fascism, and eliminating their threat to world peace? The fact that Western countries are reviving German militarism has long undermined this sacred obligation, which further proves that they have no reason to occupy West Berlin at all. Today, there are two sovereign states on German territory: the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. People absolutely cannot tolerate the fact that Western countries stubbornly refuse to recognize the German Democratic Republic on the one hand, and unscrupulously occupy its territory as a base for subverting and undermining democratic Germany on the other. Now the United States and Western countries are clamoring to take so-called "tough measures" and threatening to "resort to force" if necessary, but such clamoring cannot intimidate anyone at all. The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" pointed out that the Soviet government is determined to implement the long-planned measures to end the remnants of the Berlin occupation regime without hesitation.

    A Road of War and Disaster
    The United States and the West German government's intensified revival of German militarism has deepened the division of Germany and pushed West Germany onto the path of war and disaster. This road has twice brought tremendous sacrifices and disasters to the German people in the past half century. This is a path that violates the interests of the German nation. Therefore, it has been opposed by the German Democratic Republic and the broad masses of the West German people. In order to reunify Germany into a peaceful and democratic country, the Soviet Union and the government of the German Democratic Republic have repeatedly put forward various constructive proposals, but they have all been unreasonably rejected by Western countries and the West German government. They insist on unifying Germany by annexing democratic Germany, which makes it fundamentally impossible to solve the German unification problem.

    The path of the United States and the West German government's efforts to revive militarism is a path of troublemaking, failure, more troublemaking, more failure, and heading towards final destruction. In the past, the people of the world had the power to eliminate Hitler's Germany, then today, when the first peaceful fortress - the German Democratic Republic - has appeared on German territory, when the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is becoming stronger and stronger, and the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, the people of the world have even more power to destroy all the ghosts of Hitler.

    西德军国主义复活的严重危险
    席林生
    最近，德意志民主共和国政府发表了关于武装西德的政策造成对和平的威胁的备忘录和关于德意志联邦共和国政府的侵略政策的白皮书。这些文件以有力的事实告诉世界人民：今天西德正在走上希特勒德国的老路。无数事实已证明，第二次世界大战时千百万人民为之流血牺牲而赢得的波茨坦协定在西德遭到了最严重的破坏。在美国的帮助和扶植下，一个新的军国主义的德国在德国西部的领土上复活起来了。
    凶神恶煞重登“宝座”
    为了铲除德国军国主义势力的经济基础，波茨坦协定曾经明确规定：德国经济应在尽速之可能日期内使其分散，以消灭目前卡特尔、辛迪加、托辣斯及其他独占协定所形成之经济力量之过分集中。但是十三年来西德在美国和其他西方国家的怂恿下，走的完全是另外一条道路。目前西德资本的集中比战前有过之无不及。在1958年，大公司控制62.5％股份资本，而在1938年则为37.1％。其中十七个垄断集团控制着西德全部股份资本的80％左右。九个钢铁康采恩垄断了冶金工业生产的93.9％，铁矿开采量的99.9％，煤开采量的69.9％，焦炭生产的75.2％。在金融资本方面，前德意志帝国的三家最大垄断银行：德意志银行、德累斯顿银行和商业银行拥有的资产占了西德全部银行资产的60％，已超过战前年代总资本一倍以上。
    美国新闻“与世界报道”曾经写道：“目前鲁尔的大多数头子都是希特勒时代飞黄腾达的人物”。事实也确是如此。例如枪炮大王克虏伯家族在整个一个多世纪以来都是靠制造杀人武器发财致富。普法战争时它卖给普鲁士和法国前膛式炮；第一次大战时它卖给德意志帝国“大蓓塔”长射程炮；第二次大战时它又为希特勒制造“虎式”坦克和潜水艇，供他进行侵略战争之用。第二次大战结束时，克虏伯这样一个大战犯仅被判处十二年徒刑。但是关了不到三年，到1951年就被美国占领当局释放出来，之后美国又把财产发还给他。今天克虏伯重新成了一个拥有近七十个巨大企业和三十亿马克资产的垄断帝国。他的钢铁厂年产钢达三百五十万吨。他正在全世界各地进行扩张，并积极准备制造原子武器。再如法本化学康采恩，第二次大战中它供给了希特勒军队全部炸药的80％和炮弹的70％。它还为纳粹制造屠杀集中营人民的毒气。但是现在又成为世界最大化学公司之一，它控制着西德化学工业的股份资本的70％，产品占德国化学产品的85％。过去法本康采恩的那些领导人也早已从监狱里走出来重又登上了经理、董事的宝座了。
      纳粹罪犯东山再起
    波茨坦协定也曾明令规定：战争罪犯及造成暴行或战争罪行之人物，必须加以逮捕并交付审讯。但是实际上今天西方占领国拘禁纳粹战犯的监狱早已空空如也。战后初期的几千名战犯现在剩下的已寥寥无几了。即使这寥寥无几的战犯也将马上被释放。现在许多纳粹罪犯重又成了西德阿登纳政府里的宠儿。在目前政府机构中，共有十八万多名官员和雇员曾经在希特勒手下担任过同样的职务。譬如西德政府的十七个部长中就有八人曾是希特勒党卫军的头子和纳粹政府的官员。在联邦司法部门中，六百名纳粹的法官占有重要的地位。这些纳粹党徒正在干起他们的老行业来。像过去党卫军头子、现在的内政部长施罗德，策划了取缔共产党和宣布许多个民主组织为非法的暴行，最近又准备公布“国家紧急状态”的法令来镇压反对原子武装政策的罢工和示威。
      侵略本性依然如故
    德国军国主义者在恢复经济势力和政治势力的同时，也正在竭力设法恢复它们的军事势力。西德总理阿登纳、国防部长施特劳斯、外交部长勃伦塔诺以及许多西德的将军们毫不掩饰他们重建军队的目的，是要发动复仇主义战争和攫取欧洲霸权。阿登纳曾经表示：有了德国师团，就可以在“可能时向东方进攻”。11月19日施特劳斯在北大西洋集团议员会议上更公然叫嚣西德海军的任务是准备和苏联作战。西德外交部长勃伦塔诺则公开提出要恢复德国1937年的疆界。最近西德陆海空三军总参谋长豪辛格说得更露骨，他说：西德军队今天面临着1939年德国国防军同样的任务。事实上，今天的西德军队也已举行过许多次针对苏联、民主德国和其他社会主义国家为假想敌人的原子战争的演习。
    但是，西德军国主义者的野心并不仅仅是针对东方，他们的矛头也指向西方。例如豪辛格就曾叫嚣说：“当我们有了十五个师的时候，我们便将用另一种声调与法国人讲话了。”而阿登纳党的代理主席阿诺德也公然威胁荷兰政府立即放弃第二次大战中获得的靠近西德领土的一块狭长地带。
    西德的重新武装完全是美国一手造成的。美国早就蓄意把西德变为挑起新战争的一支欧洲突击队。因此，当美国把德国分裂之后，就积极重建西德的军队。经过美国几年来的扶植，现在西德已建立一支拥有十七万五千名士兵的国防军。其中三万七千是空军、一万七千是海军。海军共有一百多艘军舰。空军也在大批订购飞机，据消息透露，到1963年西德将有一千三百多架飞机。整个国防军在六十年代初将达到三十五万人。目前美国将军公开叫嚷要使西德武装力量变成“大西洋公约武装力量的主要部分”。西德的纳粹将军斯派达尔和弗尔奇也分别当上了北大西洋集团侵略军中欧司令和“盟军”最高司令部的副参谋长。但是西德军国主义者并不以此为满足。最近他们又吵着要建立中北欧统一司令部，把丹麦和挪威的军事力量划归中欧司令斯派达尔来指挥。
    原班人马　新式武器
    这支新建立的西德国防军在很多方面是和希特勒的国防军一模一样的。这也不奇怪，因为这支新国防军的许多高级军官本是过去国防军的老人马。目前有二百一十五名希特勒军官在西德军队里担负领导工作。例如四星上将斯派达尔过去是希特勒总参谋部驻法国总部的总参谋长，他不仅占领过法国、屠杀过法国的爱国志士而且在苏联乌克兰采行过所谓“焦土”政策。现任陆、海、空三军总参谋长的豪辛格也曾是希特勒的总参谋部的作战部部长，曾帮同希特勒策划过第二次世界大战。现任西德驻北大西洋集团联络官的基尔曼塞克，是希特勒的装甲师参谋部的少校。在1941年他曾狂妄地叫嚣要把波兰“从历史上消灭”。西德海军司令鲁格是纳粹的海军上将，曾领导过对波兰的袭击。现在他又要求西德海军做好战斗准备对苏联海上供应线进行骚扰。可以看出，这些纳粹刽子手的凶残依然不减当年。
    目前美国和西德军国主义者又正竭力要把这支新国防军用原子武器装备起来。今年3月西德联邦议院已正式通过了以原子武器装备西德军队的决议案。不久前西德国防部发言人又宣布：美国将在年底前向西德提供二十四个可以装置核弹头的“诚实的约翰”式火箭和两个火箭发射台。操纵火箭的人员也正在美国接受使用原子武器的训练。不仅如此，西德的军事工业也正在从事制造火箭和原子武器的研究工作。在波恩、汉诺威和斯图加特的一些军火工厂正在生产导弹和火箭的材料。通过和法国的合作，在阿尔萨斯的圣路易地方成立了法、德导弹研究院，它们并在阿尔及利亚的科隆培沙共同试验发射导弹。在原子武器方面，西德国防部长施特劳斯已公开表示：三、五年后西德将不顾巴黎协定的规定而自己生产核武器。很显然，当凶恶的德国军国主义者手上拿上了原子武器之后，他们的侵略野心也就更大。这对欧洲和世界的和平是一个严重的威胁。
    必须结束对柏林的占领
    美国和西德政府积极复活德国军国主义已经把波茨坦协定的精神完全破坏殆尽，而唯一保留下来的仅是根据这一精神而实行的西方国家对西柏林的占领制度。这种情况是不能让它继续下去的。事实很明显，美国和英法及西德政府既然已经粗暴地践踏了波茨坦协定，那末它们据以占领西柏林的法律基础也就已经完全丧失了。因此，最近苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫提出的、并得到民主德国政府支持的关于结束占领柏林制度的残余的建议是完全合理的，它得到广大德国人民的欢迎。但是现在西方国家又以所谓“占领权利”、“管制西柏林的庄严义务”来为他们占领西柏林辩解。但是人们不禁要问，这个所谓“管制西柏林的庄严义务”是什么呢？它不正是指肃清德国军国主义和法西斯主义，根除它们对世界和平的威胁吗？西方国家复活德国军国主义的事实早已破坏了这个庄严的义务，这就更加证明它们占据西柏林完全没有理由。今天德国领土上存在着两个主权国家：德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国。人们绝对不能容忍西方国家一方面顽固地拒绝承认德意志民主共和国，一方面又肆无忌惮地占领着它的领土作为颠覆和破坏民主德国的基地。现在美国和西方国家叫嚷要采取所谓“强硬措施”、必要时“诉诸武力”等进行威胁，但这种叫嚣根本吓不倒任何人。苏联“真理报”指出：苏联政府决定毫不动摇地实现早已酝酿成熟了的关于结束柏林占领制度残余的措施。
    一条战争和灾难的道路
    美国和西德政府加紧复活德国军国主义加深了德国的分裂，把西德推向战争和灾难的道路。这条道路在过去半个世纪中曾经两次给德国人民带来了巨大的牺牲和灾难。这是一条违反德国民族利益的道路。因此它遭到了德意志民主共和国和广大西德人民的反对。为了使德国重新统一成为一个和平、民主的国家，苏联和德意志民主共和国政府曾无数次地提出各种建设性建议，但一概受到西方国家和西德政府的无理拒绝。他们坚持要以吞并民主德国的办法来统一德国，这就根本不可能解决德国的统一问题。
    美国和西德政府竭力复活军国主义的道路是在沿着捣乱、失败、再捣乱、再失败而走向最后的灭亡的道路。过去世界人民有力量消灭希特勒德国，那末今天当德国土地上已经出现第一个和平堡垒——德意志民主共和国的时候，当以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量越来越强大，东风已经压倒西风的时候，世界人民就更有力量使一切希特勒的幽灵遭到毁灭。（附图片）
