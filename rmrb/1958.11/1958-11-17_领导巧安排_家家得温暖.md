The People's Daily Commentary:

    (Our Report) The Jixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province, in order to ensure that all commune members can live warmly and eat well during the winter, used Xibingma Village as a pilot site. After discussions and research with the masses, they came up with five methods to solve the village's heating problem. At the same time, improvements were also made to the management of the canteen and the food service. The village's heating methods are:

    1.  The village has a total of five canteens. If coal is used for heating, each dining hall would need 30 jin of coal per day, totaling 150 jin per day, which is quite expensive. After everyone's research, they came up with a win-win solution - using the fire from small earthen furnaces for iron smelting for heating. The method is: dismantling the old stove platforms and using six unbaked bricks to build on the spot. The small furnace is directly connected to the heated brick bed (kang). The top of the small furnace should be about one foot in size and can be covered. If the kang needs to be heated, the cover can be placed on top and a bellows can be used to fan the fire. Each time, 62 jin of coal, 20 jin of ore, and 16 jin of limestone are used, which can produce 12 to 14 jin of iron. The test results are very good, with strong firepower and high temperature. The village used this method to solve the heating for one dining hall and 17 commune member households. Three dining halls use the kitchen fire to heat the dining hall's kang and also burn some charcoal for warmth. Another dining hall could not build a heated brick bed, so a boiler is used to heat water, which not only solves the heating problem but also provides hot water for commune members to drink.

    2.  For heating commune members' homes, the main method is to assign the making of pig feed and stir-frying livestock feed to the commune members' households. The village needs to stir-fry 200 jin of feed per day and make 31 pots of pig feed, which can solve the heating for 41 commune member households.

    3.  Six flour mills are set up in the winter, and commune members make noodles at home, which solves heating for five households.

    4.  Single commune members are mobilized to live in shared houses during the winter. This method reduces the need for heating for six households. In addition to the above methods, ten laborers are assigned to collect firewood, and they can collect 40,000 jin in twenty days. In this way, the heating problem for all 107 households in the village is completely solved.

    The commune members' cotton clothes were also prepared in advance. Without affecting production, elderly women were found to help the sewing and laundering factory make cotton clothes, and most of them have been completed. In Yaoshizhuang Commune, there are five elderly women who, after finishing the commune members' cotton clothes, are currently making cotton shoes for the commune members. Therefore, some people say, "Eating well and having a warm kang, this is really worry-free." (Guo Jincheng)

    领导巧安排  家家得温暖
    本报讯　河北蓟县党委为了保证冬天社员都能住得暖和，吃得满意。以西兵马村为试验点，同群众座谈和研究，想出五个办法解决了全村的取暖问题。同时，对食堂的管理和伙食工作也作了改进。该村取暖的办法是：
    一、全村共有五个食堂，如果用烧煤解决取暖，按一个饭厅每天用煤三十斤，每天即需一百五十斤。花销较多，经过大家研究，想出一举两得的办法——用小土炉炼铁的火取暖。方法是：将旧锅台拆去，就地用六块坯垒上，小炉直通火炕，小炉上口要一尺左右，并可加盖，如需炕热，可将上盖盖上，用一个风箱拉火，每次用六十二斤煤，二十斤矿石，石灰石十六斤，能出铁十二斤到十四斤。通过试验效果很好，火力强，温度高。该村用这种办法解决了一个饭厅和十七户社员的取暖。有三个饭厅是用厨房的火烧饭厅的炕，并扒些火炭烤火。另一个饭厅因不能搭火炕，就用锅炉烧水，不但能解决取暖而且还能供给社员喝热水。
    二、群众住房取暖，主要办法是把猪食和炒牲口料分到社员户去作，全村每天需炒料二百斤，作猪食三十一锅，这样能解决四十一户社员取暖。
    三、冬季搞粉磨六盘，在社员家漏粉，这样解决五户取暖。
    四、发动单身社员在冬季并屋子居住。这种办法减少六户烧炕。除以上办法外，抽训十名劳力打柴，二十天就能打四万斤。这样全村一百零七户的取暖问题就全部解决了。
    社员的棉衣也都提前作了准备，在不影响生产的前提下，找老大娘帮助缝纫浆洗厂作棉衣，一般的都作完了。该社钥匙庄有五个老大娘，把社员的棉衣作完后，目前正在给社员赶作棉鞋。因此，有的人说：“吃的好，炕又暖和，这就省心了”。　　　（郭金城）
