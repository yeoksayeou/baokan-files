    Beijing Municipal Party Committee Theory Journal
    "Frontline" Semi-Monthly Launched

    (Our newspaper news) The "Frontline" semi-monthly journal, sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, is scheduled to be launched on November 25.

    The journal's "Inaugural Statement" states that this journal will use Mao Zedong Thought, that is, the integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and use the spirit of continuous revolution to guide itself, striving to make itself a timely ideological weapon for the Party organizations in Beijing to reflect reality, guide practice, and transform reality. This journal will stand at the forefront of implementing the Party's guidelines and policies and other central instructions, at the forefront of the socialist revolution, at the forefront of socialist construction, at the forefront of the struggle of Marxist-Leninist ideology, at the forefront of the struggle against all kinds of bourgeois ideology and modern revisionism, and at the forefront of the struggle against various unhealthy tendencies and evils within the people.

    The "Inaugural Statement" points out that the ideological style of the vast majority of Party members in Beijing is healthy, and particularly since the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the Great Leap Forward, there has been leaping progress. However, the doctrine of the mean, middle-of-the-roadism, and nitpicking criticisms of the mass movement still appear from time to time, creating trouble, and must be constantly exposed and criticized.

    The "Inaugural Statement" says that to stand at the forefront of revolution and construction, it is necessary to stand among the masses, in the movement, to be closely linked with the masses, and to lead the masses forward together on the basis of their conscious awareness.

    北京市委理论刊物
    “前线”半月刊创刊
    本报讯　中共北京市委主办的“前线”半月刊，定于11月25日创刊。
    刊物的“发刊词”说，这个刊物将用毛泽东思想，即马列主义普遍真理跟中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的思想，用不断革命的精神，指导自己，努力使自己成为北京市党的组织及时地反映现实、指导实践、改造现实的思想武器。这个刊物要站在贯彻执行党的方针、政策和中央其他指示的最前线，站在社会主义革命的最前线，站在社会主义建设的最前线，站在马列主义思想斗争的最前线，站在反对各色各样的资产阶级思想和现代修正主义斗争的最前线，站在反对人民内部各种歪风、邪气斗争的最前线。
    “发刊词”指出，北京市绝大多数党员的思想作风是健康的，特别是整风、反右和全民大跃进以来，又有飞跃的进步。但是中庸主义、中游主义和对群众运动的吹毛求疵派还时隐时现，兴妖作怪，必须不断地加以揭露和批判。
    “发刊词”说，要站在革命和建设的最前线，就必须站在群众之中，运动之中，跟群众血肉相连地打成一片，在群众自觉的基础上，领导群众一同前进。
