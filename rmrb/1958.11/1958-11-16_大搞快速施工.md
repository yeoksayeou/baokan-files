    Vigorously Promote Rapid Construction

    Under the current situation of the great leap forward in the national economy, the scale of our country's capital construction has expanded unprecedentedly. This year's completed investment in capital construction will greatly exceed the planned target, and the investment in capital construction next year will be much higher than this year. Such an unprecedented increase in capital construction tasks marks the rapid development of our country's construction undertaking. This is good news that excites the people of the whole country, and it is also a very glorious and arduous task for the broad masses of construction workers in our country. Although our country's construction strength has grown year by year, it still lags behind the needs of the large increase in construction tasks. What should we do? Do as much as we can with the resources we have. This is the simplest way. But this is the method of the promoters of retreat, which the broad masses of construction workers are ashamed to imagine. Is it feasible to expand the construction team and recruit more construction workers? This is also a way, but it is impossible to transfer a large amount of labor to construction enterprises under the current situation of extremely tight labor in urban and rural areas. The most effective way to solve the contradiction between tasks and strength is for construction enterprises to mainly rely on their own strength to speed up project progress and complete one or even several times the construction and installation tasks in the same amount of time and with the same amount of strength.

    Can the progress of construction projects be accelerated? The broad masses of construction workers have already answered this question affirmatively with practical actions. Since March and April of this year, after the Harbin No. 1 Construction Company adopted the method of rapid construction and built three buildings in 18 days, many places such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenyang have successively promoted the advanced experience of rapid construction. The progress of many projects has accelerated by one time, two times, or even more than ten times. Projects that used to take three to five years or several months to complete now only take one to two years or dozens of days. Such a construction speed is unprecedented in the history of our country and rare in the world. This proves that it is entirely possible to speed up the progress of construction projects.

    Some comrades worry: Will the promotion of rapid construction only focus on speed while sacrificing quality and economy? These comrades' concerns are certainly well-intentioned, and attention should indeed be paid to quality and economy in promoting rapid construction; but if we hesitate to move forward with rapid construction because of this, it is wrong. In fact, rapid construction not only greatly accelerates project progress, but also can comprehensively achieve the goals of more, faster, better, and more economical. Because the progress is accelerated, more tasks can be completed in the same amount of time and manpower, achieving the goal of more. Because the progress is accelerated, labor productivity is improved, machinery and equipment are used rationally, management costs, wage funds, machinery costs, turnover materials, and temporary facility costs are reduced, and project costs are significantly reduced, which can achieve the goal of economy. The project costs of units that are now promoting rapid construction are generally reduced by about 20%, and some have reached 30%. As for project quality, it is generally good. Some comrades also worry about whether safety is guaranteed when rapid construction is carried out. It is entirely correct to pay attention to construction safety. However, whether it is safe or not mainly depends on whether we attach importance to it ideologically and whether we have thorough measures. If we attach importance to it ideologically and have thorough measures, we can still ensure safety even if the construction speed is fast; if we do not attach importance to it ideologically and do not have thorough measures, accidents can still occur even at a slower construction speed.

    Rapid construction is a revolution in construction enterprises. What is the key to speed? The key lies in mobilizing the masses and launching a large-scale mass movement. There can be no real rapid construction without a mass movement. In the past few years, our construction enterprises have also relied on the masses and followed the mass line, but it now appears that this work is still very insufficient, there are still too many top-down administrative orders, and there are too many unreasonable rules and regulations, which have tied the hands and feet of the broad masses. Promoting rapid construction requires giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers, mobilizing all positive factors, and organizing an intense battle to achieve a quick victory. This will inevitably fiercely impact the old leadership methods and backward rules and regulations that hinder the development of productive forces, and promote the overall leap forward of various tasks in construction enterprises. Leading cadres of various construction enterprises must consciously recognize that this is a profound revolution, improve leadership style and leadership methods, use existing experience such as "two participations, one reform, three combinations, and four great freedoms," extensively and deeply mobilize the masses, launch a mass movement for rapid construction, and train our construction enterprises into a rapid force capable of winning every battle. Some comrades worry that this will mess up construction enterprises. They always think that construction projects, especially industrial construction projects, are extraordinary, and that a set of so-called "standardized" management methods is indispensable. This is actually still not trusting the masses. May I ask: Which complex industrial construction project is not built by workers? As for chaos, when the mass movement rises, it will naturally disrupt backward rules and regulations and backward management order. This is a good thing and there is nothing to be afraid of. Only by abolishing the rules and regulations that hinder the development of productive forces can new rules and regulations be established that meet the needs of the development of productive forces.

    At present, the promotion of rapid construction is still very uneven across the country, and many places have not yet widely promoted it. In order to ensure the completion and preparation for undertaking more arduous industrial construction tasks in the future, it is necessary to quickly launch a high tide of vigorously promoting rapid construction throughout the country, and to universalize and regularize rapid construction, making it a normal construction method for the construction industry.

    Some comrades say: "Rapid construction, concentrating manpower and material resources to build a few projects as gifts is possible, but large-scale promotion is impossible." This view is obviously wrong. Yes, rapid construction requires concentrating considerable manpower and material resources; without considerable manpower and material resources, it cannot be fast. Do we currently have considerable manpower and material resources to universally promote rapid construction? As long as the work is done well and projects are carefully lined up, there is manpower and material resources. Because universally implementing rapid construction does not mean that all types of projects, regardless of their importance and urgency, are rushed into all at once. Rushing into all at once and dispersing strength will make rapid construction impossible. Universally implementing rapid construction must be carried out under the leadership of the local Party committee, distinguishing between importance and urgency, and lining up projects in order to concentrate manpower and material resources, launch batch-by-batch blitzkriegs, and complete one batch before starting another. This is called fighting a war of annihilation, not a war of attrition. Especially in the current situation of insufficient materials, machinery, and manpower, lining up projects is an effective way to implement rapid construction and ensure that key projects are put into production ahead of schedule. Of course, since there must be a queue, there will always be priorities, which requires emphasizing that "minor points" are subordinate to "major points" and that the local is subordinate to the overall situation, emphasizing the promotion of a spirit of cooperation and opposing departmentalism; but at the same time, attention should also be paid to having minor points within major points and major points within minor points. One should not pretend to be a major point, nor should one bury a major point.

    As for the fact that even after the projects have been lined up, some materials and machinery are still not supplied, this requires construction enterprises to develop a spirit of self-reliance, vigorously engage in diversified operations, produce their own materials, and produce their own machinery. According to statistics from twenty-two provinces and cities, construction enterprises have already built more than 3,200 factories, which can produce more than 120 kinds of building materials and construction machinery, greatly enhancing the initiative of enterprises, so that they do not have to reach out to the higher authorities for even a small item, which would delay construction progress. This is also a favorable condition for universally promoting rapid construction. This condition is entirely created by people. As long as construction enterprises in various places vigorously engage in diversified operations and establish their own supply bases, it will not be difficult to make material resources abundant and ensure rapid construction.

    Promoting rapid construction requires the use of advanced construction methods. With backward construction methods, the progress of construction cannot be fast. Experience has proven that expanding the scope of prefabrication and assembly of building components and implementing a combination of indigenous and foreign methods for mechanized and semi-mechanized construction is an advanced construction method for accelerating project progress. Not only reinforced concrete components, wall masonry, and partition boards can be prefabricated, but also doors, windows, plumbing, electrical, sanitation equipment, and mechanical equipment can be pre-assembled and installed as a whole. As for whether the components are prefabricated in factories or on site, it should be adapted to local conditions and adapted to the project. In places with difficult conditions, concrete projects can also be poured on site. The machinery required for construction should also use foreign methods if available, and use indigenous methods if foreign methods are not available. In construction, advanced construction methods of three-dimensional cross-parallel flow operations should also be promoted, organizing two or three shifts for production, working day and night, especially to accelerate the progress of the main project, create a working surface, so that the entire project can be fully launched, with all types of work advancing side by side, all processes interwoven closely, making full use of time and space, and minimizing or even eliminating intermittent time.

    Promoting rapid construction must be combined with vigorously engaging in technological innovation. Speed is not just something that can be achieved by brute force. Increasing labor intensity can be effective for a while, but it is ultimately difficult to sustain. Only by carrying out a mass movement of technological innovation, combining hard work with skillful work, and combining work with rest, can it be truly fast and sustained. In the past few months, construction workers have already put forward more than 2 million technological innovation proposals, and invented and created 765 better machines and tools. Now, the technological innovation movement should be further carried out, organized typification and standardization work should be carried out, and several advanced machines, tools, and advanced operation methods should be selected and vigorously promoted in various types of work and procedures.

    Rapid construction is a decisive measure to accelerate the progress of capital construction. It is hoped that Party committees in various places will strengthen their leadership over rapid construction, and it is hoped that all construction workers will take active action to launch a high tide of rapid construction!

    大搞快速施工
    在当前国民经济大跃进的形势下，我国的基本建设规模空前扩大，今年的基本建设投资完成额将大大超过预定计划，明年的基本建设投资额将比今年还要多得多。基本建设任务这样空前的增长，标志着我国的建设事业正在飞跃的发展。这是一个令全国人民无比兴奋的好消息，也是我国建筑业广大职工一项十分光荣和艰巨的任务。我国的建筑力量虽然逐年壮大，但仍然落后于建设任务大量增长的需要。怎么办呢？有多少力量干多少活，干多少算多少，这是一种最简单的办法。但这是促退派的办法，是广大的建筑职工耻于设想的。扩大建筑队伍，多招些建筑工人行不行呢？这也是一种办法，但是在目前城乡劳动力极其紧张的情况下，不可能向建筑企业大量输送劳动力。解决任务和力量的矛盾的最有效的办法，就是建筑企业主要依靠自己的力量加快工程进度，用同样的时间和力量完成一倍，以至几倍的建筑安装任务。
    建筑工程进度能不能加快呢？建筑业的广大职工已经用实际行动肯定地回答了这个问题。自从今年3、4月间，哈尔滨第一建筑公司采用快速施工的方法，十八天建成三幢楼房以后，北京、上海、沈阳等许多地方都相继推行了快速施工的先进经验，许多工程的进度加快了一倍、两倍，以至十倍以上。过去要用三五年、几个月才能完成的工程，现在只要一两年、几十天就完成了。这样的建设速度，在我国历史上是空前的，在世界上也是少有的。这就证明了加快建筑工程的进度是完全可能的。
    有些同志耽心：推行快速施工会不会只顾快，而丢掉好，丢掉省？这些同志的耽心固然也是出于好意，推行快速施工也确实应该注意质量、注意节约；但如果因此就对快速施工裹足不前，却是不对的。事实上快速施工不仅大大加快了工程进度，而且可以全面达到多快好省的目的。由于进度加快，就可以用同样的时间和人力，完成更多的任务，达到多的目的。由于进度加快，劳动生产率提高，机械设备得到合理的使用，管理费用，工资基金，机械费用，周转材料和临时设施费用减少，工程成本显著降低，就能达到省的目的。现在推行快速施工的单位，工程成本一般都降低了20％左右，有的达到30％。至于工程质量，一般也是好的。还有些同志耽心搞了快速施工，安全有没有保障？注意施工安全是完全正确的。然而安全不安全，主要决定于思想上重视不重视，决定于有没有周到的措施。思想重视，措施周到，施工速度快了，也一样可以做到安全；思想上不重视，措施不周到，再慢的施工速度也一样出事故。
    快速施工是建筑企业的一项革命。快的关键何在？关键在于发动群众，在于大搞群众运动。没有群众运动就不可能有真正的快速施工。过去几年来，我们的建筑企业也依靠群众，也走群众路线，但现在看来，这方面的工作还是很不够的，还是自上而下的行政命令多，不合理的规章制度多，这就束缚了广大群众的手脚。推行快速施工，要求充分发挥广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，调动各个方面的积极因素，组织一场速战速决的紧张的战斗。这就必然要猛烈地冲击那些障碍生产力发展的旧的领导方法和落后的规章制度，促进建筑企业各项工作的全面跃进。各个建筑企业的领导干部必须自觉地认识这是一场深刻的革命，改善领导作风、领导方法，用“两参、一改、三结合、四大”等已有的经验，广泛深入地发动群众，大搞快速施工的群众运动，把我们的建筑企业锻炼成一支能够百战百胜的快速部队。有些同志耽心，这样一来会把建筑企业搞乱了。他们总以为建筑工程，特别是工业建筑工程非同小可，没有一套所谓“正规化”的管理方法是不行的。这实际上还是不相信群众。试问：哪一项复杂的工业建筑工程不是依靠工人盖起来的？至于说到乱，群众运动起来了，自然会打乱落后的规章制度和落后的管理秩序，这是好事，没有什么可怕的。只有废除了障碍生产力发展的规章制度，才能建立新的，适应生产力发展需要的规章制度。
    目前，快速施工在全国推行的情况还是很不平衡的，许多地方还没有普遍推广。为了保证完成和准备担负今后更加繁重的工业建设任务，必须迅速地在全国范围掀起一个大搞快速施工的高潮，并且把快速施工普遍化、经常化，使之成为建筑业正常的施工方法。
    有些同志说：“快速施工，集中人力物力搞个把工程献礼是可以的，大面积推广办不到”。这种看法显然是错误的。是的，快速施工要求集中相当的人力物力；没有相当的人力物力是快不起来的。我们目前有没有相当的人力物力普遍推行快速施工呢？只要工作做得好，认真进行工程排队，是有人力、有物力的。因为普遍实行快速施工，并不是说各类工程不分轻重缓急，一拥而上。一拥而上，力量分散，就不可能有快速施工。普遍实行快速施工必须在地方党委领导下，分别轻重缓急，进行工程排队，以便集中人力物力，分批突击，搞完一批，再上一批。这叫作打歼灭战，不打消耗战。特别是在目前材料、机械和人力不足的情况下，进行工程排队，是实行快速施工，保证重点工程提前投入生产的有效办法。当然，既然要排队，总会有先有后，这就要强调“轻点”服从“重点”，局部服从整体，强调发扬协作精神，反对本位主义；但是，同时也要注意重点中有轻点，轻点中有重点，既不能冒充重点，也不要埋没重点。
    至于工程排队之后，仍然有些材料和机具供应不上，这就需要建筑企业发展自力更生的精神，大搞多种经营，自产材料，自产机具。据二十二个省市的统计，建筑企业已经建成了三千二百多个工厂，能够生产一百二十多种建筑材料和施工机械，大大增强了企业的主动性，不必缺一点东西就伸手向上面要，而耽误施工进度，这也是普遍推行快速施工的有利条件。这种条件完全是人创造出来的。各地建筑企业，只要大搞多种经营，建立自己的供应基地，也就不难使物力充裕起来，保证快速施工。
    推行快速施工，必须采用先进的施工方法。施工方法落后，施工进度是快不起来的。经验证明，扩大建筑物构件预制装配的范围，实行土洋结合的机械化、半机械化施工，是一种加快工程进度的先进的施工方法。不仅钢筋混凝土构件、砌墙和隔墙板可以预制，门窗和水暖、电气、卫生设备、机械设备也可以预先组合，整体安装。至于构件是在工厂预制还是在现场预制，应当因地制宜，因工程制宜。在条件困难的地方，混凝土工程也可以在现场浇灌。施工需要的机械，也应当有洋用洋，无洋用土。在施工中还应该推行立体交叉平行流水作业的先进施工方法，组织两班或三班生产，昼夜施工，特别是要加快主体工程的进度，创造工作面，使整个工程全面展开，各工种齐头并进，各工序互相穿插，紧密衔接，充分利用时间和空间，尽量减少以至消灭间歇时间。
    推行快速施工必须和大搞技术革新相结合。快，并不只是拼体力就能做到的。提高劳动强度可以见效于一时，但终难持久。只有开展群众性的技术革新运动，使苦干和巧干结合，劳逸结合，才能真正地快、持久地快。几个月来，建筑业职工已经提出的技术革新建议达二百多万件，发明和创造的较好的机械和工具达七百六十五种。现在应当进一步开展技术革新运动，有组织地进行选型和定型工作，在各个工种、工序中选定几种先进的机械、工具和先进的操作方法大力推广。
    快速施工是加快基本建设进度的一项决定性的措施。希望各地党委加强对快速施工的领导，希望全体建筑职工积极行动起来，掀起快速施工的高潮！
