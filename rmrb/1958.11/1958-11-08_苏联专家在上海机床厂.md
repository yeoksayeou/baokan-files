When reporters visited the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, they heard many engineers, technicians, and workers talk with gratitude about the Soviet experts who were helping them work there. People said: What the experts give us is first-class technology, close friendship, and the noble qualities of Soviet people that are worth learning well.

		Building New and Better Products

In the second half of last year, Soviet screw grinder expert Rabotkina came to the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, bringing with her all the technical data for the "582" screw grinder that the factory was preparing to manufacture. However, when she learned that the factory had even better production conditions, she suggested manufacturing the "5822" screw grinder. This is a new type of high-precision grinder with even better performance. The finished products it processes will not differ in precision by even one sixty-fourth of a hair's breadth. The Soviet Union had only recently completed its design. The factory leaders and engineers were very happy to hear this and immediately changed their minds.

However, the technical requirements for this high-precision grinder are extremely high, with more than 3,000 parts and components of all sizes. In the past, the factory's designers calculated errors in terms of hundredths of a millimeter; now, they were required to calculate in terms of thousandths of a millimeter. The engineers had never seen technical data in this area, and expert Rabotkina only brought assembly reduction drawings of this grinder. She wrote letters to her Moscow internal grinder factory and relevant Soviet departments, requesting materials, while also preparing lectures to teach everyone about the structure and performance of high-precision screw grinders. Three months later, a complete set of design data for the "5822" grinder was sent from Moscow. The engineers began intensive design work with Rabotkina's help.

In June of this year, Rabotkina returned to her country for vacation. Two months later, she brought back a whole box of drawings, all of which were urgently needed by the factory. In fact, Rabotkina was hardly on vacation! According to a letter from the personnel sent by the machine tool plant to the Moscow internal grinder factory for internship, the expert was busy in the workshop all day after returning to her country, and sometimes went to factories related to screw grinder processing and assembly to collect information. Rabotkina also brought back parts such as the lead screw, nut, and speed generator from the screw grinder. These were gifts from the workers of the Moscow internal grinder factory to their Chinese brothers. With these actual samples, the machine tool plant workers quickly mastered the technology for manufacturing these parts. Later, someone learned that this Soviet expert, who loved movies very much, was so busy during her vacation that she didn't even see a single movie.

		The Fortieth and First

During the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward this spring, the machine tool plant's designers put forward a Great Leap Forward target: to design forty new types of grinders and instruments in the first half of the year.

This news reached Soviet expert Ablosimov. He was extremely happy and said privately to the translator: "The Chinese comrades are making a Great Leap Forward, so we must also have a Great Leap Forward!" How to leap forward? Ablosimov and several staff members of the expert office discussed it and decided to design a new product to add to the Great Leap Forward target.

Ablosimov is a gear grinder expert. Seeing that technicians and workers lacked instruments when measuring gear transmission accuracy and that assembly was very troublesome, he decided to design an instrument called a gear transmission accuracy automatic recorder to solve this problem for the factory, and asked two translators and a clerk to cooperate.

This instrument was quite complex, with more than 400 parts and 300 drawings to be made. Ablosimov reserved the difficult parts for himself and asked the translators and clerks to help with the simple ones. But they didn't understand design. The expert started by teaching the most basic operating techniques, such as using drawing instruments, and enthusiastically guided them in drawing. At this time, Ablosimov was helping the factory design the high-precision "5831" gear grinder, and his work was quite intense. He designed the grinder during the day and the instrument at night, sometimes without even stopping for lunch breaks. The expert was thin and weak, and had been wounded in the Patriotic War, so his right hand was not very flexible; but he still insisted on working at the drawing board day and night, using his left hand when his right hand was tired. Others were afraid that he would overwork himself and advised him to rest earlier, but he politely refused.

Before the "May 1st" International Labor Day, Ablosimov completed the entire design of this instrument and handed this thick bundle of drawings to the factory's design department as a festival gift.

		Design According to Chinese Conditions

The machine tool plant's technicians and workers are now able to independently design and manufacture Chinese models of precision grinders. When talking about this, people especially miss Comrade Rakivillin, the Soviet expert who helped work in the factory a year ago.

Comrade Rakivillin came to the factory at the end of 1955. The first suggestion he made after arriving at the factory was to ask Chinese designers to design according to China's specific conditions and needs, and not to simply copy the drawings of Soviet products. He said frankly: "The climatic conditions in the Soviet Union and China are different, and the manufacturing and usage conditions are also different. There are also several factories in the Soviet Union that manufacture grinders, and each factory has its own design style, so it cannot be copied." From the first day he arrived at the factory, Rakivillin was determined to help this factory train its own Chinese machine tool designers and establish a series of Chinese model grinders.

Comrade Rakivillin first set an example in his work. An important component of the hydraulic equipment on the grinder is called an oil cylinder, which is made of seamless steel pipes in the Soviet Union and other countries, but our country has difficulty supplying steel pipes. After the expert learned about this, he suggested: "Since steel pipes are difficult to buy, can we switch to using cast iron?" So he immediately began to research and design cast iron oil cylinders. After seeing that he was somewhat confident, he invited Chinese engineers to study together. As a result, they succeeded. Cast iron worked just as well as steel, not only solving the difficulty of insufficient materials, but also allowing it to be cast in the factory itself, greatly reducing costs.

Comrade Rakivillin not only encouraged designers to develop independent thinking and creativity, but also advocated humbly learning from others and striving for the latest and best designs. He always asked Chinese designers to give their opinions on his own designed drawings again and again. Once, the expert made a drawing of the transmission part of a grinder, and a designer made a modification suggestion on one of the parts. The expert was overjoyed when he saw it and said: "It is completely correct for you to take such an attitude towards work. The improved design can be said to be the crystallization of three continents. The United States and the Soviet Union have had this kind of thing before, but there are still certain shortcomings in the structure. With your improvement, it is especially perfect."

Before Comrade Rakivillin returned to China last November, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant built China's first Chinese model precision grinder.

    苏联专家在上海机床厂
    新华社记者　季群　叶世涛
    记者在上海机床厂访问的时候，听到许多工程师、技术员和工人怀着感激的心情，谈起在那里帮助工作的苏联专家。人们说：专家给予我们的是头等的技术，是亲密的友谊，还有那值得我们很好学习的苏维埃人的崇高品质。
              造新的造好的
    去年下半年，苏联螺丝磨床专家拉鲍脱基娜来到上海机床厂，随身带来了工厂准备制造的“五八二”螺丝磨床的全部技术资料。但是当她知道工厂具备更高的生产条件以后，就建议制造“五八二二”螺丝磨床。这是一种性能更好的新型高精度磨床，加工出来的成品，精密度不会相差一根头发丝的六十四分之一，苏联也是不久前才设计完成的。工厂的领导人和工程师们一听非常高兴，马上改变了主意。
    但是，这种高精度磨床的技术要求极高，光是大大小小的部件、零件就有三千多种。在设计上，过去工厂设计人员是以百分之几公厘计算误差的，现在要求千分之几公厘。工程师们从来没有看到过这方面的技术资料，拉鲍脱基娜专家也只带着这种磨床的装配缩形图。她一面给自己所在的莫斯科内圆磨床厂和苏联有关部门去信，请求提供资料；一面便编写讲义，给大家上课，讲解高精度螺丝磨床的结构和性能。三个月以后，全套“五八二二”磨床的设计资料从莫斯科寄来了。工程师们在拉鲍脱基娜的帮助下开始了紧张的设计工作。
    今年6月份，拉鲍脱基娜回国去休假。两个月以后，她带回整整一箱子的图纸，这些都是工厂迫切需要的材料。其实，拉鲍脱基娜哪里是去休假的！据机床厂派在莫斯科内圆磨床厂实习的人员来信说，专家回国以后整天都在车间里忙着，有时还到同螺丝磨床加工装配有关的工厂去收集资料。拉鲍脱基娜还带来了螺丝磨床上的丝杆、螺帽和测速发电机等零件。这是莫斯科内圆磨床厂工人送给中国兄弟的礼物。机床厂工人有了这些实样，便迅速地掌握了制造这些零件的技术，后来有人知道，这位很爱好电影的苏联专家，休假期间竟然忙得一场电影都没有看过。
                  第四十一种
    今年春天的生产大跃进高潮中，机床厂的设计人员提出了一项跃进指标，要在上半年设计出四十种新型的磨床和仪器。
    这个消息传到了苏联专家阿勃洛西莫夫那里。他高兴极了，私下里对翻译人员说：“中国同志大跃进，我们可也要来个大跃进啊！”怎么跃进呢？阿勃洛西莫夫和专家办公室的几个工作人员一商量，决定也设计一种新产品，给跃进指标加码。
    阿勃洛西莫夫是齿轮磨床专家。他看到技术人员和工人们测量齿轮传动精度时缺乏仪器，装配的时候非常麻烦，决定设计一种叫做齿轮传动精度自动记录仪的仪器，给工厂解决这个问题，并且要求两个翻译员和一个文书员合作来搞。
    这种仪器相当复杂，有四百多个零件，要画三百张图纸。阿勃洛西莫夫把困难的部分留给自己做，简单的请翻译员和文书员帮助。但是他们不懂设计。专家便从使用绘图仪器等最基本的操作技术教起，热情地指导他们画图。这时候，阿勃洛西莫夫正在帮助工厂设计高精度的“五八三一”齿轮磨床，工作相当紧张。他白天设计磨床，晚上设计仪器，有时连中午休息时也不停息。专家身体瘦弱，又在卫国战争中负过伤，右手转动不大灵活；但是他仍然日夜坚持在设计台前，右手累了就用左手。别人怕他劳累过度，劝他早些休息，都被他婉言拒绝了。
    “五一”国际劳动节前夕，阿勃洛西莫夫完成了这架仪器的全部设计，把这厚厚的一大束图纸交给了工厂的设计科，作为节日的献礼。
    要根据中国条件来设计
    机床厂的技术人员和工人现在能够独立设计制造中国型号的精密磨床了。谈到这一点时，人们特别怀念一年前曾经在厂里帮助工作的苏联专家拉基维林同志。
    拉基维林同志是在1955年底来厂的。他到厂以后提出的第一个意见是，要求中国设计人员根据中国的具体情况和需要进行设计，不要照搬照抄苏联产品的图纸。他直率地说：“苏联和中国的气候条件不同，制造和使用情况也不一样，苏联制造磨床的工厂又有好几家，各厂有各厂的设计风格，不能照搬。”从到厂的第一天起，拉基维林就立志帮助这个工厂培养出中国自己的机床设计人员和建立中国型号的磨床系列。
    拉基维林同志在工作中首先作出了榜样。磨床液压设备上有一种重要的部件叫油压筒，苏联和其他国家都是用无缝钢管做的，但是我国钢管供应有困难。专家知道后就提出：“既然钢管难买，能不能改用生铁来做？”于是他就立即开始研究和设计生铁油压筒，看看有些把握就请中国工程师一起研究。结果成功了。生铁做的同钢做的一样好用，不但解决材料不足的困难，还可以在本厂自己浇铸，成本大大减轻。
    拉基维林同志不但鼓励设计人员发挥独立思考和创造精神，也提倡虚心向人学习，尽量争取最新最好的设计。他自己设计的图纸，总是再三要求中国设计人员提出意见。有一次，专家制作了一张磨床传动部分的图纸，一位设计人员对其中一个零件提出修改意见。专家一看不由大喜说：“你对工作采取这样态度是完全正确的。现在改进的设计，可说是三大洲的结晶。在美国和苏联，以前都有过这种东西，但是在结构上还有一定缺点，经你这一改进，就格外完善了。”
    拉基维林同志去年11月回国以前，上海机床厂造出了我国第一台中国型号的精密磨床。
