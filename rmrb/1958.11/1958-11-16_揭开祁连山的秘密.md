Unveiling the Secrets of the Qilian Mountains

The Qilian Mountains, stretching for 800 kilometers, stand as a screen southwest of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province. The year-round snow cover on the mountain peaks resembles a thousand miles of silver waves. In the valleys of the high mountains, glaciers reflect myriad rays of cold light under the sun. Ever since people learned of the Qilian Mountains, they have been a mystery, and no one has been able to unlock their secrets, or even dared to think about it. However, the people of Gansu, who have diverted thousands of rivers to the mountains and transformed the Gobi Desert into fields, have begun to take on this task. Now, the work of conquering the snow-capped mountains and glaciers has begun, and the day when all the secrets of the Qilian Mountains are revealed is not far away!

Unveiling the Secrets of Glaciers

The water from the glaciers in the Qilian Mountains irrigates millions of mu of fertile land in the Hexi Corridor. In the past, the melting of ice and snow was entirely determined by weather and climate, and people could not control it. The water flowed down the mountains at times that often did not correspond to the agricultural seasons, and the amount of water could not meet the needs. To make full use of the snow water on the mountains, it is necessary to understand the glaciers. A glacier exploration team of 120 people, carrying a glorious mission, entered the Qilian Mountains in July.

A detachment led by Li Sijing and Xia Kairu rode camels from Subei Mongolian Autonomous County to climb the Qilian Mountains. At this time, although the Gobi Desert was hot, the Qilian Mountains were already very cold. They set up tents by the glaciers to live. The team members put on shoes with cleats, took ice axes, and worked in groups of three or four, tied together with nylon ropes, sliding on the glass-like ice. The climate of the glaciers is "four seasons in one day," changing constantly. The surveyors fought against nature at the risk of their lives. Sometimes, the team members suspended themselves with ropes, going down into the depths of the ice cracks to observe the secrets of the ice. They sprinkled coal powder or carbon black on the ice surface to blacken the glaciers. The results of the experiment showed that the ablation of glaciers could be accelerated by dozens to a hundred times. Airplanes could be used to spread a large amount of carbon black and coal powder on the glaciers, causing them to melt and flow down the mountains half a month or a month earlier.

After two months of efforts by all the surveyors, the secrets of the Qilian Mountains glaciers were revealed. The total area of the glaciers is 1,000 square kilometers, the thickness of the ice layer is between 40 meters and more than 100 meters, and the total storage capacity is 30 billion cubic meters, which is equivalent to the water stored in 500 Ming Tombs Reservoirs. Now, people are studying how to use this ice to increase more wealth for the people of the Hexi Corridor.

Artificial Snowfall

September 30th afternoon was a good day. There was no sign of rain or snow within dozens of kilometers around the main peak of the Qilian Mountains. At this time, an Ilyushin Il-12 aircraft flew around the clouds near the main peak several times, scattering 12 kilograms of dry ice. In less than ten minutes, the clouds changed, and snowflakes fell on the top and slopes of the mountain, continuing for more than 30 minutes. The sky around the snowfall area remained clear. The aircraft conducted the same experiment in the Lizhulongguan and Dudashaliang areas of the Qilian Mountains, and the miracle of artificial snowfall also appeared.

The purpose of artificial snowfall and making the glaciers of the Qilian Mountains melt and flow down the mountains earlier is to change the drought situation of the Hexi Corridor. After the glaciers melt earlier and the melting speed is increased, the storage capacity of the glaciers will gradually decrease. Artificial snowfall can compensate for the decrease in the storage capacity of the glaciers, and the snow water can continuously and freely serve the agricultural production of the Hexi Corridor.

Railway in the Mountains

The iron ore in the Jingtieshan Mountains is very good ore. A steel complex being built near Jiuquan needs it. Therefore, a large number of railway construction workers are braving wind and snow to build a railway along the cliffs of the Qilian Mountains, entering the Beida River.

The railway winds through the Beida River canyon. Standing where the railway line passes, looking up, you see the steep peaks covered with white snow, and under your feet is the roaring river, with a maximum flow rate of more than ten cubic meters per second. On such steep slopes, even sure-footed blue sheep sometimes lose their footing and fall to their deaths. When the railway construction workers first entered here, they took explosives, picks, and cleared small paths just enough to stand on, and moved forward cautiously. Because the slopes of the mountain canyons are too steep, it is impossible to set up tents, and the railway construction workers live in cold mountain caves at night.

Now, projects such as the 83-meter-high and 5-hua-li-long (2.5 km) tunnel have begun construction. The section of railway from Jiuquan to the Jingtieshan mining area, more than 8,000 meters long, will be open to traffic in September next year. This road will transport countless secrets and countless treasures from the Qilian Mountains. The Qilian Mountains will no longer be silent!

### 揭开祁连山的秘密

    揭开祁连山的秘密
    绵延八百公里的祁连山脉，屏列在甘肃省河西走廊的西南面，山顶终年不化的积雪，像千里银色的浪涛。高山的山谷里，冰川群在阳光下射出万道寒光。自从人们知道有祁连山到现在，这个山一直是个谜，没有人能够揭开它的秘密，甚至没有人敢想过。但是，把数千河流引上高山，曾经把戈壁和沙漠改造成田的甘肃人民，开始担起了这个担子。现在，征服雪山冰川的工作已经开始，全部揭开祁连山秘密的日子，已经不远了！
    揭开冰川的秘密
    祁连山上冰川化的水，灌溉着河西走廊千百万亩良田，过去，冰雪的融解完全决定于天时气候，人们无法控制它，雪水下山的时候往往不能和农业季节相适应，水量也不能满足需要。充分利用山上的雪水，就要摸清冰川的底。一支由一百二十人组成的冰川勘探队，带着光荣的任务，在7月进入了祁连山。
    李思敬和夏开儒等率领的一个分队，从肃北蒙古族自治县骑骆驼爬上了祁连山。这时，戈壁滩上虽然炎热，而祁连山上已经寒意很浓。他们在冰川边上支起帐篷住下来。队员们穿上了有钉子的鞋，拿着冰镐，三、四人一组。用尼龙绳相互系着，在玻璃似的冰上擦滑着。冰川的气候“一天四季”，变化多端。勘测人员冒着生命的危险和自然搏斗。队员们，有时把自己用绳子吊着，下到冰缝的深处，察看冰的秘密。他们把煤粉或炭黑撒在冰面上，黑化冰川，试验的结果，可以使冰川的消融加快数十倍至一百倍，可以用飞机向冰川撒播大量的炭黑和煤粉，使冰川提前半月或一月消融出山。
    经过全体勘测人员二个月的努力，祁连山冰川的秘密被揭开了。冰川的总面积达一千平方公里，冰层厚度在四十公尺至一百多公尺间，储量共达三百亿公方，等于五百个十三陵水库所蓄积的水量。现在，人们正在研究，如何利用这些冰，给河西走廊的人民增加更多的财富。
    人工降瑞雪
    9月30日下午是个好天气，祁连山主峰四周数十公里看不到下雨、降雪的任何迹象。这时，一架伊尔——12型的飞机，在主峰附近云层中飞行了几圈，撒下十二公斤的干冰，不到十分钟，云块发生了变化，山顶和山坡飘下了雪花，继续了三十多分钟之久。在降雪区周围的天空，依然是一片晴朗。飞机在祁连山的里珠龙观和杜大沙梁地区，作了同样试验，结果也同样出现人工降雪的奇迹。
    人工降雪和使祁连山冰川提前消融下山，目的都是为了改变河西走廊的干旱面貌。冰川提前消融和增加消融速度后，冰川的储量就渐渐减少，人工降雪就可弥补冰川储量的下降，雪水能够源源不绝地，随心所欲地为河西走廊的农业生产服务。
    山上铁路
    镜铁山的铁矿石是很好的矿石。在酒泉附近建筑的一座钢铁联合企业正需要它。因此，大批的筑路工人们，正冒着风雪，沿着北大河进入祁连山的悬崖峭壁间修筑铁路。
    这条铁路蜿蜒在北大河峡谷里，站在铁路线经过的地方抬头看头顶是覆盖白雪的陡峭山峰，脚下是咆哮的大河，河水的流速最高在每秒十公方以上。在这样陡峭的山坡上就是擅于攀登的青羊，有时也会失足摔死。铁路建设人员开始进入这里时，拿着炸药、洋镐、辟出仅能立足的小路，小心翼翼地前进。因为山峡坡度太陡，无法支搭帐篷，铁路建设人员夜晚就住在冰冷的山洞里。
  　现在，八十三公尺高、五华里长的大隧道等工程，已经展开施工，从酒泉至镜铁山矿区八千多公尺长的一段铁路，明年9月就可以通车。这条路将从祁连山内运出无数的秘密，运出无数的宝藏，祁连山再不沉静了！
