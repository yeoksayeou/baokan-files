    Launch Mass Seed Collection and Commune-Run Nursery Movement
    Ministry of Forestry Convenes On-Site Meeting on Forest Tree Seedlings in Fourteen Southern Provinces
    (By our reporter) To summarize and exchange experiences in seed collection and seedling cultivation in various regions, and to promote the mass seed collection and commune-run nursery movement, the Ministry of Forestry convened an on-site meeting on forest tree seedlings in fourteen southern provinces and regions (including Henan and Shaanxi). From September 28th to October 29th, the attending representatives visited the forest farms, nurseries of people's communes, and state-owned nurseries in Yuanling, Hengyang, Qiyang, Qidong, Lingling in Hunan, and Maoming, Xinyi, Dianbai, Wuchuan in the Zhanjiang area of Guangdong. The summary meeting was finally held in Zhanjiang.
    Through on-site visits and exchange of experiences, the representatives emancipated their minds, broke down superstitions, and clearly recognized that as long as they firmly relied on the leadership of the Party and fully mobilized the masses, the difficulty of insufficient seedlings for afforestation and greening could be completely solved. Hengyang County in Hunan and Maoming County in Guangdong have basically achieved a situation where every commune and team has its own nursery, and have created large-scale high-yields. The seedlings needed for mass afforestation can be self-sufficient. In the first half of this year, Maoming County collected 470,000 jin of seeds and cultivated more than 6,000 mu of seedlings, with the seedling cultivation area roughly equivalent to the total nursery area of agricultural cooperatives in a province such as Jiangxi, Zhejiang, or Fujian. These facts greatly encouraged the participating representatives. They unanimously agreed that carrying out mass seed collection and commune-run nursery movement is not only necessary but also possible.
    The meeting pointed out that, according to the new situation of the comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the rural communization in our country, in terms of afforestation, we must not only green all barren mountains and wasteland at high speed, but also achieve landscaping and rapid high-yield timber production. Therefore, future seedling work must continue to vigorously carry out mass seed collection, commune-run nursery and high-yield seedling movements to fully supply high-quality seedlings to meet the needs of all parties.
    The meeting summarized the main experiences of various regions in carrying out mass seed collection and commune-run nursery movement as follows: 1. Party committees attach importance, leaders take action, make unified arrangements, and mobilize the whole people. 2. Put politics in command, emancipate the mind, trust the masses, and rely on the masses. 3. Run commune forest farms on a large scale, organize professional teams, and combine the shock seed collection and seedling cultivation movement with regular seed collection and seedling cultivation work. 4. Organize inspections and evaluations, and carry out red flag competitions. 5. Establish a seedling cultivation guidance network to popularize seedling cultivation technology.
    The main measures for high-yield seedling production are: 1. Communes should delineate, manage, and operate mother tree forests well to improve seed quality and consolidate and expand the source of improved seeds. 2. Seeds should be collected in a timely manner, processed promptly, and stored and transported properly. 3. In terms of seedling cultivation technology, it is necessary to master deep plowing and multiple plowing, meticulous land preparation; apply a large amount of layered organic base fertilizer and appropriate topdressing at the right time; timely drain waterlogging and resist drought; appropriately early sowing, dense sowing and timely prevention and control of diseases and insect pests and other links.

    开展人人采种社社育苗运动
    林业部召开南方十四省林木种苗现场会议
    本报讯　为了总结和交流各地采种、育苗工作经验，以推动人人采种社社育苗运动，林业部召开了南方十四省区（包括河南、陕西）林木种苗现场会议。与会代表于9月28日开始至10月29日止，先后参观了湖南的沅陵、衡阳、祁阳、祁东、零陵和广东湛江地区的茂名、信宜、电白、吴川等地人民公社的林场、苗圃和国营苗圃，最后在湛江市进行总结。
    通过现场参观和交流经验，代表们解放了思想，破除了迷信，明确认识到只要坚决依靠党的领导，充分发动群众，造林绿化种苗不足的困难是完全可以解决的。湖南衡阳县和广东茂名县都基本上做到了社社队队有苗圃，并创造了较大面积的丰产，群众造林所需的种苗，可以自给自足。茂名县今年上半年采种四十七万斤，育苗六千多亩，育苗面积约相当于江西、浙江或福建一个省的农业社育苗总面积。这些事实，给与会代表以极大的鼓舞，他们一致认为，开展人人采种，社社队队育苗运动不仅是必要的，而且是可能的。
    会议指出，根据我国工农业生产全面大跃进和农村公社化的新形势，在造林方面，不仅要高速度绿化一切荒山荒地，而且要实现园林化和林木快速丰产。因此，今后的种苗工作，必须继续大力开展人人采种，社社育苗和种苗丰产运动，充分供应良种壮苗，以满足各方面的需要。
    会议总结各地开展人人采种社社育苗运动的主要经验是：一、党委重视，领导动手，统一安排，全民动员。二、政治挂帅，解放思想，相信群众，依靠群众。三、大办公社林场，组织专业队伍，把突击性采种育苗运动与经常的采种育苗工作结合起来。四、组织检查评比，开展红旗竞赛。五、建立育苗辅导网，普及育苗技术。
    种苗丰产的主要措施是：一、社社划定和经营管理好母树林，以提高种子质量，巩固和扩大良种来源。二、种子要适时采集，及时处理，妥善贮运。三、在育苗技术上要掌握深耕多耕，细致整地；多量分层施用有机基肥，适当适期追肥；及时排涝抗旱；适当早播、密播和及时防除病虫害等环节。
