    Leader, Mentor, Loving Father, and Comrade-in-Arms
    Reading "Following Chairman Mao on the Long March"
    Li Xifan
    After finishing Comrade Chen Changfeng's "Following Chairman Mao on the Long March," I couldn't suppress the excitement in my heart. For an old revolutionary warrior who participated in the Long March, this is such a precious memory! Comrade Chen Changfeng is not a writer, but a deputy commander of a military region of the People's Liberation Army. However, the historical fragments recorded by his passionate pen are more touching and fascinating than some literary works written by writers. I think this is primarily because the real life recorded by the author has profound typical significance. Secondly, it should be said that the life depicted by the author is his own personal experience, and therefore, compared to some writers who describe indirect life, it is imbued with deeper emotions. This makes this memoir, to a great extent, possess rich literary characteristics.
    "The Long March," this arduous and earth-shaking struggle led by our Party, is itself a great epic that can never be fully written. Countless moving stories circulate on that heroic journey of twenty-five thousand miles. This period was also a crucial turning point in the Chinese revolution—the Party Central Committee corrected the "Left" opportunist line and established the correct line centered on Mao Zedong Thought. People are eager to know (even the smallest details) how the great leader led the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation through snow-capped mountains, across grasslands, overcoming countless difficulties, and heading to the front lines of the War of Resistance Against Japan in those difficult years! Although "Following Chairman Mao on the Long March" does not directly depict Chairman Mao's political leadership life during this period (because the author did not have access to this aspect of life at the time), Chen Changfeng, as Chairman Mao's bodyguard and orderly, recorded the great leader's noble qualities of hardship, simplicity, humility, and class love from his daily work and life. The author's indelible impressions, which seem to be ordinary records, contain very rich and inspiring content, leaving you unable to calm down for a long time after reading them. For example, in the sixth section, "Crossing the Jinsha River and Entering the Yi Ethnic Region," there is a small story describing Chairman Mao entering the camp, which is so exciting to the author and the readers!
    Upon entering the campsite, Chen Changfeng set up a bed for the Chairman, but because he couldn't find a desk to arrange the office supplies, he didn't pay attention to it and busied himself with getting hot water for the Chairman. After dawn, the Chairman returned and, seeing that there was no desk, criticized Chen Changfeng in a serious but gentle tone: "The important thing now is work, eating and drinking are minor matters. Two or three thousand of our comrades are waiting on the other side of the river! These are the lives of tens of thousands of comrades!" So, the Chairman gave Chen Changfeng a humorous and educational punishment—ordering him not to sleep but to sit at the table and accompany the Chairman in his work. However, after sitting for a while, the Chairman smiled and told Chen Changfeng, who was filled with remorse, to go to sleep, kindly admonishing him: "Remember, whether now or in the future, the most important thing for us is work."
    Although the plot of this little story is very simple, how profound is the feeling of a revolutionary in these short dialogues of the Chairman. After reading this little story, I quickly thought of a scene in the newsreel "Ode to the Yan River"—the light in the Yan'an cave dwelling where the Chairman lived. The narration tells us that during the years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chairman worked here until late every night. ... For decades, our great leader has been working tirelessly for the Party and the people! "Whether now or in the future, the most important thing for us is work," how profoundly and powerfully this expresses the thoughts and feelings of a great revolutionary! It should become the motto of every revolutionary.
    In this memoir, more of the records are about the close comradeship in work and life between the author and the Chairman. Chen Changfeng was only a sixteen-year-old child when he followed Chairman Mao on the Long March. As he said, "It's less that I took care of the Chairman, and more that the Chairman took care of me." It should be said that this is the author's summary of the main content of this memoir. The author vividly describes how he received the Chairman's meticulous care, cultivation, and education in the process of following Chairman Mao on the Long March, making the reader deeply realize what a good foundation this laid for this young Red Army soldier to later grow into a commander of a military region of the People's Liberation Army. It also makes us clearly see how deep the fighting friendship and how close the comradely relationship were between the great leader and the comrades working around him.
    Comrade Chen Changfeng wrote with respectful passion: "The Chairman taught me revolutionary principles, taught me to read, and helped me learn culture. When he knew I missed home, he wrote home letters for me. During night marches in heavy rain, the Chairman, fearing that I would fall, took the lantern from my hand and held it himself to light the way for us little devils. Especially unforgettable is when crossing the Liupan Mountains, I had malaria for several days in a row, and my body was weak. When I was about to climb to the top of the mountain, I was shaking with cold and fainted on the mountain. The Chairman thought I had another bout of malaria, so he took off his leather coat and put it on me, while he himself wore only a lined jacket, braving the biting cold wind."
    All of this profoundly and vividly tells us that Chairman Mao was not only a great leader and mentor to the young people working around him, but also a loving father and close comrade-in-arms. Therefore, as a revolutionary memoir, "Following Chairman Mao on the Long March" not only records the great leader's admirable and lovable selfless revolutionary work spirit for the Party and the people from many wonderful life stories, and educates us ideologically on how a revolutionary should work, but also educates us from the great leader's attitude towards life and dealing with people on how a revolutionary should live, and how a communist should live harmoniously in a collective.
    We welcome Comrade Chen Changfeng's "Following Chairman Mao on the Long March." We welcome and eagerly hope that more and more veteran comrades will write more and more such revolutionary memoirs for us.

    领袖、导师、慈父和战友
    读“跟随毛主席长征”
    李希凡
    读完了陈昌奉同志的“跟随毛主席长征”，我抑制不住内心的激动，对于一个参加过长征的老革命战士来说，这是多么珍贵的回忆啊！陈昌奉同志不是一个作家，而是一个解放军的军区副司令员，但是，他的充满着激情的笔触所记录下来的这历史的片段，却比某些作家写的文艺作品，更能打动人心，更能引人入胜。我想，这首先是因为作者所记录的真实生活就具有深刻的典型意义，其次应该说是作者所描绘的生活是自己的切身经历，因而，比之某些作家描写间接的生活，贯注了更加深厚的感情。所以使得这个回忆录在很大程度上，具有着丰富的文艺特点。
    “长征”，我们党所领导的、这震动中外的艰苦卓绝的斗争生活，它本身就是永远写不完的伟大史诗。多少可歌可泣的故事，流传在那两万五千里的英雄路程上。而这个时期，又是处在中国革命的伟大转折点的时期——党中央纠正了左倾机会主义路线，建立了以毛泽东同志的思想为中心的正确路线。人们多么渴望知道（那怕是最微小的细节）伟大的领袖在那艰苦的年月里，怎样领导着中华民族的优秀儿女们，跨过雪山，通过草原，战胜了数不清的困难，杀奔抗日前线！“跟随毛主席长征”，虽然没有从正面描写毛主席在这一时期的政治领导生活（因为作者当时并不接触这方面的生活），但是，作为毛主席当时的警卫员、勤务员的陈昌奉同志，却从他所接触到的日常工作和生活里，记述了伟大领袖的艰苦、朴素、谦逊、阶级友爱等崇高的品质。作者的那些不可磨灭的印象，看来都是一些平凡的记述，但却具有非常丰厚的激动人心的内容，使你读了以后，久久地不能平静下来。像第六节“渡过金沙江，进入彝族区”里，有一段描写进入宿营地的毛主席的小故事，它是怎样激动着作者和读者的心啊！
    进入宿营地，陈昌奉给主席搭了一个铺，可是，没有找到办公桌，摆不开办公用具，他就没有注意这件事，忙着去给主席打开水了。天亮后，主席回来看到没有办公桌，便用严肃而又温和的语气批评陈昌奉说：“现在重要的是工作，吃饭喝水是小事，江那边有我们两三万同志在等着哪！这是几万同志的性命呀！”于是，主席给了陈昌奉一个幽默而又带有教育作用的处分——罚他不睡觉，坐在桌旁陪主席工作，然而，刚坐了一会儿，主席就又笑着叫充满内疚心情的陈昌奉去睡觉了，亲切地告诫他：“记住，无论现在和将来，对我们来说，最重要的是工作。”
    这个小故事的情节虽然很简单，但是，在主席这些简短的对话里，跃动着多么深厚的革命者的感情。看了这个小故事，使我很快地联想起新闻纪录片“延河之歌”的一个镜头——主席居住过的延安窑洞的灯光。解说词告诉我们，在抗日战争的年代里，主席每天在这里工作到深夜。……数十年如一日，我们伟大的领袖，为党为人民一直就是这样永不疲倦地工作着！“无论现在和将来，对我们来说，最重要的是工作”，这是多么深刻有力地表达了一个伟大革命家的思想感情！它应该成为每一个革命者的座右铭。
    在这本回忆录里，更多的记述，是作者和主席相处时期的工作和生活上的亲密的战友关系。陈昌奉同志跟随毛主席长征的时候，不过是一个十六岁的孩子。正像他所说的：“与其说是我照顾主席，还不如是主席照顾我”，应该说这是作者总括了这本回忆录的主要内容。作者生动地记述了在跟随毛主席长征的工作过程里，怎样受到了主席的无微不至地关怀、培养和教育，使读者深切地体会到，这给这个年轻的红军战士，后来成长为解放军的军区司令员，奠定了一个多么良好的基础。也使我们清楚地看到了，伟大的领袖和他的周围的工作同志，有着多么深厚的战斗友谊和多么亲密无间的同志关系。
    陈昌奉同志怀着敬爱的激情写道：“主席告诉我革命道理，教我识字，帮我学文化。当他知道我惦念家时，就代我写家信。夜行军下大雨，主席怕我摔倒，就从我手里取过马灯，自己提着给我们小鬼照路。尤其难忘的是在过六盘山时，我一连发了几天疟疾，身体虚弱，当快爬到山顶时，我冻得混身发抖，竟昏倒在山上。主席以为我又犯了疟疾，便把他的皮衣服脱下来给我穿上，自己却穿着一身夹衣，顶着刺骨的冷风。”
    所有这一切，都是多么深刻、生动地告诉了我们，毛主席对于他周围工作的青年人，不仅是伟大的领袖和导师，而且还是慈爱的父亲和亲密的战友。因此，作为一本革命回忆录，“跟随毛主席长征”不只从许多精采的生活故事里，为我们记述了伟大领袖的为党为人民可敬可爱的忘我的革命工作精神，从思想上教育了我们一个革命者应该怎样工作，而且也从伟大领袖的待人处世的生活态度里，教育了我们一个革命者应该怎样生活，一个共产主义者应该怎样融洽无间地生活在集体里。
    我们欢迎陈昌奉同志的“跟随毛主席长征”，我们欢迎，也殷切地希望更多更多的老同志，为我们写出更多更多的这样的革命回忆录来。
