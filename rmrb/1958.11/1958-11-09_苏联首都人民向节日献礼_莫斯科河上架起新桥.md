    Soviet Capital's People Offer Gifts for the Festival
    New Bridge Erected Over the Moscow River
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th. A new type of bridge spanning the Moscow River, with the upper level for cars and pedestrians and the lower level for underground trams, as well as "Komsomol Avenue," a major eight-kilometer-long thoroughfare in Moscow, have been completed on the eve of the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution.
    Previously, Moscow's underground trams could not cross the Moscow River, causing much inconvenience to passengers. The completion of this new bridge connects the underground railways on both sides of the Moscow River, which is of great significance for Moscow's traffic. Now, when the underground tram approaches the Moscow River, it can directly cross the river on the new bridge and then dive back into the underground railway.
    Including the approaches, the newly built bridge is two kilometers long and 35 meters above the river. The upper level of the bridge is now open to traffic, and the lower level will soon be put into use.

    苏联首都人民向节日献礼
    莫斯科河上架起新桥
    新华社莫斯科8日电　横跨莫斯科河的一座上层可通汽车和行人、下层可通地下电车的新型桥梁以及一条长达八公里的莫斯科市的干道“共青团大街”，在十月革命四十一周年前夕完工。
    从前，莫斯科的地下电车不能通过莫斯科河，给旅客造成许多不便。这座新桥梁的建成使莫斯科河两边的地下铁道衔接起来，对莫斯科的交通来说，具有重要意义。现在，当地下电车开到莫斯科河附近时，它便能直接从河面上的新桥梁穿过，然后又钻入地下铁道。
    这座新建的桥梁连桥头进路计算在内全长达二公里，离河面高度为三十五公尺。桥梁的上层现已通车，下层也即将交付使用。
