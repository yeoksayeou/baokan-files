    Special Queue
    Several queues were lined up outside the Student Union office, longer than usual for buying theater tickets. I pushed through the crowded people, trying to find out what show was being shown. Faces both excited and nervous flashed before me, revealing an eagerness that couldn't be found in ordinary ticket-buying queues. Suddenly, a white work coat flashed through the crowd, and several doctors were intently giving injections to the students. I was completely bewildered, when I saw a large sign that read:
        Rescue a Critically Ill Patient!
    A woman in labor at the Beijing Affiliated Hospital is suffering from severe anemia, and her condition is critical, urgently requiring a blood transfusion. However, because the patient's blood type is special, it has been found to be incompatible after matching with more than two thousand people. Therefore, we request the assistance of Peking University students! Beijing Medical College
    Only then did I understand the conversation I had heard earlier, in which one person's tone was so frustrated, "My ear failed the test three times, what bad luck!" It turned out that he was afraid the doctor made a mistake, so he queued up twice to re-test.
    I quickly joined the queue. It was almost my turn, and I silently prayed, "Let me pass!" My heart was pounding. The doctor took a drop of blood from my ear and placed it on a glass slide, looking at it against the light. Ah, my eyes were also fixed on the doctor, holding infinite hope. Immediately, she picked up a small red slip and gave it to me, telling me to go to have a blood transfusion. Ah! I really wanted to jump up. Holding the small red slip, my face was glowing, as if I had already snatched the patient back from the brink of death!

    特别的排队
    学生会办公室那边排着好几串队伍，比平时买戏票的还要长得多。我穿过拥挤的人群，想去打听一下是看什么戏。从我面前闪过一张张又兴奋又紧张的脸，流露着迫不及待的神色，这种情景在普通的售票队伍中是寻不到的。忽然在人堆里闪过了白色的工作衣，几个医生正在聚精会神地给同学们打针。我正被搞得莫明其妙，只见一张大纸上写着：
        抢救垂危病人！
    北京附属医院一产妇因极度贫血，病情严重，急待输血抢救。但因该病人血型特殊，已与两千余人配血仍不适合，为此请求北大同学援助！　北京医学院
    我这才弄懂刚才听到的一席对话，其中一位的语调是那样的懊丧“我的耳朵验了三次都不合格，真倒霉！”原来他怕医生验错了，又两次排队重验。
    我赶紧也站到队伍里。好容易快轮到我了，我默念着：“让我合格吧！”心怦怦跳着。医生从我耳朵上取了一滴血放在玻璃片上，对着亮处在看，啊，我的眼睛也死盯着医生，抱着无限希望。立刻，她从前面拿起了一张小红纸条给我。叫我去输血。啊！我真想跳起来。我拿着小红纸条，满面红光，就好像已经把病人从死亡的边缘夺了回来！
