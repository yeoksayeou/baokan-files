    Excavating Treasures
    Some people say, "Traditional Chinese medicine is unscientific." However, there are many diseases that Western medicine cannot treat, or for which its efficacy is very low, but which, after being treated by traditional Chinese medicine, show immediate and remarkable effects. This fact is a powerful rebuttal to those who say "Traditional Chinese medicine is unscientific." Although many valuable experiences in Chinese medicine still need to be整理 (zhěnglǐ - sorted and organized) and improved, many facts now prove that it is indeed a great treasure trove. I advise those who stubbornly cling to foreign things to turn around and look at the facts of traditional Chinese medicine treating diseases in various places. These are tens of thousands of rare and precious treasures accumulated by our ancestors over thousands of years, and we must inherit and carry forward the medical heritage of our motherland.
    The Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine has already cultivated the first batch of "Chinese-Western medicine combined" doctors in our country, and this is only a beginning. We believe that before long, our socialist national new medicine will surely appear in the world.

    发掘珍宝
    有些人说：“中医不科学”。可是，有许多病，西医无法治疗，或者疗效很低，而经中医诊治，立见奇效。这个事实就是对那些“中医不科学”论者的有力回击。中国医药学里的许多可贵的经验虽然还要整理提高，但现在的许多事实证明，这确是一个伟大的宝库。奉劝那些死抱住外国不放的人们，回转身来，看一看各地中医治疗疾病的事实。这些都是我们祖先几千年来积累起来的万千奇珍异宝，我们要继承发扬祖国的医学遗产。
    中医研究院中医研究班已经培养出我国第一批“中西合璧”的医生，这只是一个开端。我们相信，不要多久，我国社会主义的民族的新医学定会出现在世界。
