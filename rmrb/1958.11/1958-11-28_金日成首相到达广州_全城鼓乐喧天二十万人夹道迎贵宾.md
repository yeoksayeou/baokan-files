Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 27th: Premier Kim Il-sung and all members of the Korean government delegation arrived in Guangzhou this morning from Hankou on a special plane, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, and Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Qiao Xiaoguang. The entire city of Guangzhou was jubilant, filled with music, and more than 200,000 people lined the streets to welcome the distinguished Korean guests.

The news that Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean guests were coming to Guangzhou caused the entire city to boil over. At the break of dawn, people put on their festive costumes, waved colorful flags, held flowers, and beat gongs and drums, converging on the airport and the roads the guests would be passing through. The dozen or so kilometers of highway from the airport to the guesthouse resembled a colorful corridor. Everywhere in the city hung the national flags of China and North Korea, and huge red banners with gold characters such as "Welcome the Korean Government Delegation Headed by Premier Kim Il-sung," "Long Live Sino-Korean Friendship," "Long Live the Great Socialist Camp Headed by the Soviet Union," and "Long Live World Peace" fluttered in the wind.

At 11:50 a.m., when Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean guests' plane landed, the military band played "Beijing-Pyongyang" and "Song of General Kim Il-sung." At this moment, thunderous applause and singing filled the air, and shouts of "Welcome Premier Kim Il-sung" and "Long Live Premier Kim Il-sung" rang out in the welcoming crowd.

Today, wearing the First Class National Flag Medal awarded to him by the Korean government, he arrived early to welcome the distinguished guests. Also present to welcome Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean guests were the responsible persons of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City.

After receiving flowers from the Young Pioneers, Premier Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou Enlai and others went around the field to meet the welcoming crowd. Premier Kim Il-sung first came to the welcoming ranks of the troops, many of whom were victorious Volunteer Army soldiers, and the medals awarded to them by the Korean government shone brightly on their chests. In the ranks of the literary and art workers, the actors wore brightly colored stage costumes and welcomed Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean guests with performances full of national characteristics. In front of the militia team composed of five hundred militiamen, Premier Kim Il-sung said to them in fluent Chinese: "Hello, comrades!" The militiamen immediately replied: "Hello, Premier Kim Il-sung." Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean guests were warmly welcomed by the young students, who scattered colorful paper and ribbons on Premier Kim Il-sung, and presented bouquets of flowers to the distinguished guests.

Amidst the continuous storm of applause, Premier Kim Il-sung, covered with ribbons and petals, rode in an open car accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and Governor Chen Yu, passing through the enthusiastic welcoming crowd towards his residence. The streets were crowded with people, and the whole city was jubilant. Batch after batch of young women surged out of the ranks to offer flowers to the distinguished guests. Premier Kim Il-sung accepted the bouquets and constantly shook hands with the flower presenters. When the Prime Minister's car arrived in front of the guesthouse, the cheering crowd was simply boiling over.
