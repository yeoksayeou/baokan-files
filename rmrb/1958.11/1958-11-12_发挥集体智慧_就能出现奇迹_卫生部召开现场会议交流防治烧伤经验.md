Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 11th: The Ministry of Health convened a national on-site conference on burn prevention and treatment experience in Shanghai from November 3rd to 9th to summarize and exchange the experience of Guangci Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Second Medical College in rescuing Shanggang worker Qiu Cai Kang, as well as the experience of hospitals across the country in treating severe burns. Through the exchange of experiences, the truth that medical and health undertakings must be led by the Party was further proven, and the skepticism and conditionalism of some people were shattered.

The successful rescue of seriously burned worker Qiu Cai Kang once caused a sensation throughout the country. However, some people believed that this was an "accidental miracle" and was due to the good medical conditions of Guangci Hospital. Now, the experience of various places proves that regardless of the size of the hospital or the quality of equipment, wherever politics takes command, the masses are mobilized, and collective wisdom is brought into play, miracles can occur. According to statistics, since the rescue of Qiu Cai Kang in May this year, some critically burned patients have been saved in various places. Some of them were saved in hospitals in Zibo, Jinzhou, Xuanhua and other cities, as well as in medium and small hospitals with poor equipment conditions such as Tongzhou District Hospital in Beijing and Yushiba Mining Area Hospital. When Tongzhou District Hospital in Beijing rescued chemical industry worker Jin Xuezhi, Jin Xuezhi had a burn area of 85%, with second-degree burns accounting for 60% and third-degree burns accounting for 20%. Because they learned from the experience of Guangci Hospital and tried every means to treat the patient, Jin Xuezhi finally fully recovered his health. After exchanging experiences in the treatment of burns with traditional Chinese medicine in various places, the representatives recognized that traditional Chinese medicine has unique advantages that Western medicine does not have. Among the seriously burned patients rescued across the country, most were treated with a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. In the treatment of burns, orally administered decoctions of traditional Chinese medicine can detoxify and nourish, while externally applied ointments can relieve pain, kill bacteria, and promote the growth of new skin. These traditional Chinese medicines are convenient to use and inexpensive. The Beijing Medical College Affiliated Hospital successfully used traditional Chinese medicine methods to transplant xenogeneic (chicken skin) skin in the treatment of burns, opening up new avenues for the treatment of burns in the future. Everyone believes that these experiences should be fully promoted, and further sorted out and improved through the cooperation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, which is the direction of the leap forward in burn treatment.

The meeting called on medical workers to "learn from Guangci and catch up with Guangci" to ensure that the steel marshal takes office, and also called on provinces and cities to quickly take measures to prevent burns and other industrial accidents. A total of 244 representatives and doctors of traditional Chinese and Western medicine from 27 provinces and cities participated in this meeting.

    发挥集体智慧  就能出现奇迹
    卫生部召开现场会议交流防治烧伤经验
    新华社上海11日电　卫生部11月3日到9日在上海召开全国烧伤防治经验交流现场会议，总结和交流了上海第二医学院附属广慈医院抢救上钢工人丘财康以及全国各地医院的治疗严重烧伤的经验。通过经验交流，进一步证明了医药卫生事业必需要由党来领导的真理，并且打破了有些人的怀疑论和条件论。
    抢救严重烫伤工人丘财康获得成功，曾经轰动了全国。但也有些人认为这是“偶然出现的奇迹”，是广慈医院医疗条件好的缘故。现在各地经验证明，不论医院大小，设备条件好坏，哪里政治挂帅，发动群众，发挥集体智慧，哪里就能出现奇迹。据统计，从今年5月抢救丘财康以来，各地又救活了一些危急的烧伤病人。其中有的就是在淄博、锦州、宣化等市的医院，以及北京市通州区医院和鱼石堡矿区医院等设备条件较差的中、小型的医院中救活的。北京市通州区医院在抢救化学工业工人金学芝时，金学芝烧伤面积达85％，二度伤占60％，三度伤占20％，由于他们学习广慈医院的经验，千方百计地为病人治疗，终于使金学芝完全恢复健康。在交流各地中医中药治疗烧伤的经验以后，代表们公认中医中药有为西医西药所不及的独特的优点。在全国抢救的严重烧伤病人中，有大部分是中西医合作治疗的。中医中药在治疗水火烧伤中，内服煎药可以解毒滋补，外用药膏可以止痛杀菌，促进新皮生长。这些中药使用方便，费用低廉。北京医学院附属医院在治疗烧伤时用中医方法用异种（鸡皮）皮肤植皮成功，为今后治疗烧伤开辟了新途径。大家认为，这些经验应全面推广，并且由中西医合作进一步整理提高，这是烧伤治疗工作中跃进的方向。
    会议号召医务工作者“学广慈、赶广慈”，保证钢铁元帅升帐，并且号召各省市迅速展开预防烧伤和其它工伤事故发生的措施。参加这次会议的共有二十七个省市的代表和中西医师二百四十四人。
