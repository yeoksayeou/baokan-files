"Serving People" is Glorious
Shi Heyi

Recently, canteens and nurseries have sprung up like mushrooms all over the country, especially in rural areas. Many outstanding comrades have volunteered to take up these jobs. They serve the working people wholeheartedly with boundless loyalty. They fully understand that as people are pouring all their efforts into socialist construction today, the work of canteens, nurseries, etc., has become even more important; doing this work well is of great importance to accelerating the building of socialism. Therefore, they try every means to do their work well, wholeheartedly wanting to make the labor force eat better and the children live better. However, some comrades are unwilling to do this work, saying, "Cooking, taking care of children, plus sewing and washing, are all things that serve people, like being a nanny. Now that we have been liberated for many years, people are equal, so why should we serve people?"

Serving people! At first glance, it reminds people of the various scenes of serving people in the old society: slaves serving masters, servants serving lords and ladies, those being served acting like tyrants, and those serving suffering... But what is the similarity between the images of the respected service industry personnel before us and those of the past? What is the similarity between the glorious positions now and the humble status of the past? The socialist social system is fundamentally different from the old society's social system of man oppressing man. Now, everyone is equal, labor is glorious, and all work is to serve the people.

If we still want to use the word "serving," we must first clarify: who serves whom? Why serve? In different societies, the answers to these two questions are different. In the past, those who were served were the exploiting classes, this master or that master, but now those who are served are the broad masses of the people; in the past, those who served people were enslaved people, but now those who serve people are the masters of their own affairs; in the past, serving was a desperate means of making a living; now, serving is a glorious labor of serving the people. In the past, serving and being served distinguished people's "high and low status," but now serving and being served only illustrate the different divisions of labor in society. In short, in the past it was the exploited class serving the exploiting class, but now it is the people serving the people, the nature has completely changed. Different societies endow the concept of serving people with different content. If we don't see the essence of serving people today and still look at these jobs from the perspective of the past, doesn't that show that their thinking is lagging behind the times?

What is now called "serving" by some people should be correctly called "service." Don't we all want to say "serve the people wholeheartedly"? Do we regard serving the people as very glorious? Then why are we unwilling to serve the working people specifically? If individual people being "served" have a bad attitude, are arrogant, and think they are superior because they are being "served," that is only because they lack a correct understanding of the relationship between people in our society, and the result is only to push themselves into a position of being despised and ridiculed. This does not detract from the glory of serving the people. Nor is it necessary to despise one's work because of this.

In fact, here, everyone is both a server and a served. Some people serve others through cooking, taking care of children, sewing and washing clothes, etc., while others serve these people through producing grain, building factories, etc. It's just a matter of different positions. Steelworkers, botanists, and livestock breeders, on the surface, seem to be serving steel, serving plants, and serving livestock, but tracing back to the source, aren't they all serving people? If steel, plants, and livestock are not needed by people, why would people serve them?

Are there people who don't serve people? In the past there were. Those who did not work for a living in the old society never served people, but only waited for others to serve them, and even asked people to respect them. In the new society, whoever can work but doesn't want to work and wants to sit back and enjoy the fruits of others' labor will not be respected by anyone. Can people survive without being "served" by others? No one can, including those who think they are "serving" others. Unless they can be like the legendary gods who don't eat human food, but unfortunately that is just a myth.

Our society is a society where everyone serves everyone, everyone is inseparable from being served by others, and everyone is inevitably going to serve others. This is the relationship between people now. Those who are assigned to work in the service industry should abandon all outdated views and should fully recognize the nature of their work.

Lu Xun has a sentence that solves the so-called problem of serving people for us: "Bowing down like a willing ox for the children," isn't that the meaning of serving the people?

### “侍候人”是光荣的

    “侍候人”是光荣的
    施鹤仪
    近来，食堂、托儿所像雨后春笋一般，在全国各地，特别是农村中，到处出现。许多优秀的同志自告奋勇站到这些工作岗位上去。他们以无限的忠诚全心全意地为劳动人民服务。他们完全明白：当人们正在倾注全力于社会主义建设的今天，食堂、托儿所等工作更加显示出了它们的重要性；搞好这些工作，对于加速建成社会主义有着重大的关系。因此他们千方百计地搞好业务，一心想使劳动大军吃得更好，孩子们生活得更好。但是也有的同志不愿干这些工作，说：“烧饭、看孩子，加上缝缝洗洗什么的，都是侍候人的事，像老妈子一样。现在解放多年了，人与人之间早已平等了，干么还要侍候人？”
    侍候人！猛一听，会叫人想起旧社会种种侍候人的景象来：奴才侍候主子，仆人侍候老爷太太，被侍候者作威作福，侍候者受苦受气……，可是，呈现在我们眼前的尊敬服务性行业人员的景象，同过去的那种景象有什么相同呢？现在的光荣岗位又同过去的卑贱地位有什么相同呢？社会主义的社会制度是根本不同于旧社会人压迫人的社会制度的。现在，人人平等，劳动光荣，干什么工作都是为人民服务。
    如果我们仍然要沿用这“侍候”两个字的话，就要先弄清楚：谁侍候谁？为什么侍候？在不同的社会里，这两个问题的答案是不同的。从前侍候的是剥削阶级，是这个主子或那个主子，现在侍候的是广大人民；从前侍候人的人是被奴役的人，现在侍候人的人是当家作主的人；从前的侍候，是逼不得已的谋生手段；现在的侍候，是为人民服务的光荣劳动。从前从侍候与被侍候分出人的“高低贵贱”，现在侍候与被侍候只说明社会的不同分工。总之，从前是被剥削阶级侍候剥削阶级，现在是人民侍候人民，性质全变了。不同的社会赋与了侍候人这一概念以不同的内容，不看清如今侍候人的实质，仍还按照过去的眼光来看这些工作，不是说明他们的思想落后于时代了吗？
    现在被一部分人所称作“侍候”的这个词儿，正确的说来，应该是“服务”。我们不是每个人都愿意说“要全心全意为人民服务”。把为人民服务看作非常光荣吗？那末，为什么一到具体地为劳动人民服务的时候，就不愿意了呢？如果个别被“侍候”者态度不好，盛气凌人，自以为受到“侍候”是高人一等，那只是由于他自己对我们社会里人与人之间的关系缺乏正确的理解，而结果也只是把他自己推向被鄙视被嘲笑的地位。这丝毫也无损于为人民服务的光荣。更不需要因此就轻视自己的工作。
    其实，在我们这里，人人既是侍候者，又是被侍候者。这一些人从烧饭、管孩子、缝洗衣服等工作上去侍候那一些人，那一些人又从生产粮食，建设工厂等等工作上来侍候这一些人，岗位不同而已。炼钢工人、植物学家、牲口饲养员，表面看来是侍候钢、侍候植物、侍候牲口，可是追根溯源，还不都是侍候人？钢啊、植物啊、牲口啊，这一切，倘不是人所需要的，人又怎么会去侍候它？
    不侍候人的人有没有呢？过去是有的。旧社会里的不劳而获者就从来不侍候人，却只等别人去侍候他，还要叫人尊敬他。在新社会里，凡能劳动而不想劳动，想坐享其成，那可谁也不会去尊敬他的。人能不能离开别人的“侍候”而生存呢？谁也不能，包括这些自以为是“侍候”别人的人在内。除非他能够像传说中的神仙那样，不食人间烟火食，可惜这只是神话。
    我们的社会，是人人侍候人人的社会，人人都离不开别人的侍候，人人也都免不了去侍候人，这正是我们现在人与人之间的关系。被委派去干服务性行业的工作的人应该抛弃一切陈旧的看法，应该充分认识到自己工作的性质。
    鲁迅有一句话给我们解决了所谓侍候人的问题：“俯首甘为孺子牛”，这不就是为人民服务的意思吗？
