The Colombian Communist Party is preparing to convene its Eighth National Congress in December this year, after the overthrow of the dictatorial tyrant Rojas Pinilla and the legalization of the Communist Party. From the brewing and preparation of the National Congress, it can be seen that the Colombian Communist Party has accumulated extraordinarily rich experience in its twenty-eight years of history, especially in the struggles of the past decade.

Colombia has suffered brutal fascist rule and bloody suppression. In less than eight years, reactionary forces killed 200,000 of the 13 million Colombian people, most of whom were farmers. During the same period, 50,000 houses were burned down, 800 villages were razed to the ground, and millions of patriotic democrats suffered oppression and torture. In the wave of bloody suppression, our party lost three Central Committee members and hundreds of Communist Party members. Faced with this fascist reactionary rule, the Colombian people carried out a resolute resistance.

These sufferings tempered the people, raised their awareness, and made them realize who the enemy of the people really was.

	American intervention and plunder

The ugly face of U.S. imperialism's brutal plunder of Latin America, under the beautiful guise of "Pan-American solidarity," has been exposed not only in Colombia but throughout Latin America. Nixon's disgraceful failure to "visit" South America is a clear proof of this. Between 1947 and 1948, in preparation for a new war against the socialist camp, the U.S. government tried its best to clear its rear and tie Latin American countries tightly to the U.S. chariot, and to support dictatorial regimes in these countries that practiced fascist rule internally and relied on the United States externally.

U.S. imperialism has invaded and interfered in Colombia more than once. History is the most powerful witness: In 1903, Colombia's Panama province, at the instigation of the United States, declared its independence from Colombia. In 1948, U.S. imperialism directly massacred banana workers working for the United Fruit Company. Later, the United States forced Colombia to sign a bilateral military agreement with the United States. According to this agreement, a U.S. military advisory group came to Colombia to direct and help the reactionary government carry out armed suppression of the insurgent peasants. In addition, the United States also sent "technical advisory groups" to plunder Colombia's national resources and obstruct the development of Colombia's national economy.

Imperialism, mainly U.S. imperialism, is constantly strengthening its plunder of the Colombian economy. Most of Colombia's oil resources are in the hands of Mobil Oil Company. The United States can import crude oil without using foreign exchange, but when gasoline is processed in the United States and then sold to Colombia, we must pay in U.S. dollars. This situation has promoted the oil nationalization movement, which is a question being discussed in Congress.

U.S. imperialism also exploits Colombia by lowering the prices of imported goods. Due to the continuous drop in coffee prices, which account for 70% of our country's foreign trade, our country has lost 200 million U.S. dollars annually in the past three years. Because coffee-producing countries agreed to reduce each country's coffee exports in order to stabilize coffee prices, Colombia has had to reduce coffee production by 15%, which will cost our country 150 million U.S. dollars annually. The coffee problem is a serious problem in our country, and the only way to solve this problem is to develop trade relations with the socialist camp, regardless of the obstruction of U.S. imperialism.

	Semi-feudal agricultural economy

In rural Colombia, the feudal manorial system is still retained, which restricts our country's economic development.

Despite having twenty-five years of struggle history in the peasant movement, the land problem is still a serious problem in Colombia. According to official statistics that have been deliberately reduced, 504,566 small landholders, accounting for 55% of all farmers, only have 927,124 hectares of land, that is, only 3.5% of the cultivated land. However, 4,045 landlords, accounting for only 0.44% of all farmers, occupy 11,264,021 hectares of land, that is, 44.6% of the land. Among them, 318 large feudal lords, accounting for less than 0.03%, occupy 3,777,796 hectares of land, which is equal to 14.9% of all cultivated land. In addition, more than 4.3 million farmers have no land at all. They work as hired laborers for landlords, and their wages are low, making it difficult to maintain basic needs.

The rising peasant movement opposes this feudal system. The feudal lords collude with imperialism to suppress the peasant movement.

	Solution to the crisis

Colombia is trapped in a deep crisis, which is the inevitable result of being dependent on imperialism and a semi-feudal and semi-colonial economic base. This crisis is manifested in the alarming rise in the cost of living (rising by 4% per month), the freezing of wage levels, the sharp increase in unemployment (with more than 300,000 people completely unemployed), and the decline in industrial and agricultural production.

The bourgeoisie has shown hesitation and concern on various reform issues. During the dictatorship, the bourgeoisie only made some anti-dictatorial gestures when the dictatorial government threatened their traditional interests (such as shrinking the domestic market and wasting foreign exchange). However, when the dictatorial government allowed them to restrict the trade union movement, lower workers' real wages, and purchase agricultural products used as raw materials at low prices, the bourgeoisie supported this dictatorial government.

In this situation, only the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution proposed by the Colombian Communist Party is the only way to solve the crisis. The Communist Party advocates that a broad "national liberation and democratic front" must be established, led by the working class, united with the peasant masses, and with the participation of the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie.

	The situation of the working class

Between 1932 and 1946, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Colombian working class gained many democratic rights through struggle. These democratic rights were attacked and damaged by the reactionary government after the dictatorial government first provoked the division of the workers' movement, which was originally unified in the Colombian Trade Union Confederation.

However, the Colombian working class, which has 250,000 industrial workers, has been fighting to defend its democratic rights. This year's strike struggles have all been successful. The number of trade unions is also increasing day by day. The broad masses of workers are demanding that a united conference of the two trade unions be held in order to seize the leadership of the trade unions from the hands of the opportunists. If the trade unions achieve organizational unity, then they can gradually achieve consistency in action. In the face of the fascist policy of terror, the peasant movement and the guerrilla movement rose up to defend themselves. Peasant self-defense forces and guerrillas have appeared in almost every part of the country. After many battles, the peasants have learned military technology and military tactics, making the guerrillas an invincible force. Although the Colombian government army has launched countless attacks on the guerrillas with new weapons provided by the United States, the guerrillas have not only not been "annihilated" but have grown stronger day by day. There are now six guerrilla groups in Colombia, four of which are led and organized by the Colombian Communist Party. In the past few years, the government army has not been able to attack these four guerrilla bases at all.

After the Colombian people gained democratic freedoms, the Communist Party suggested that the organization of the guerrillas be changed to an organization for striving for democratic rights, fighting for land reform, low-interest loans, and demanding government compensation for losses caused by the government's policy of terror. At the same time, the Communist Party also demanded that the guerrillas strive to increase agricultural production in various regions. However, accepting past experience, the peasants are unwilling to hand over their weapons, because possessing weapons can prevent a return to the road of fascist rule. The task of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance will be put forward at the upcoming Eighth National Congress of our party.

	Prospects for the people's struggle

Due to the division of the working class, the alliance of the bourgeoisie and other reactionary forces led the people's movement to overthrow the dictatorial tyrant Rojas Pinilla and re-established the republican legal system. The people had excessive illusions about the results of the presidential election on May 4 this year, believing that they could get rid of the dangers of militarism and dictatorial rule, and therefore passed a provision in a referendum that all public positions (public positions in the National Assembly, government, and judicial organs) would be equally divided between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. At the same time, although the Communist Party has obtained legal status and enjoys the right to vote, it has been deprived of the right to be elected.

The struggle for a complete democratic system has already begun and has achieved considerable results. In the recent election, despite all kinds of deception and threats by the military authorities, the list put forward by the Communist Party still received 100,000 votes.

In the Colombian people's struggle, many difficulties still need to be overcome. Although imperialism has been discredited, it is still using conspiracies and tricks in Latin America. However, in the struggles of the past decade, it has provided rich experience for the people of our country and the people of other countries on the continent. The Eighth National Congress of our party will focus on pointing out the road of struggle that combines the struggle for democracy with the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal land revolution.

The Colombian Communist Party, united like a rock, fully supports the declaration of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties. At the upcoming Eighth National Congress of our party, a program for expanding the united front and uniting the masses will be formulated to fight for the liberation of Colombia from the control of U.S. imperialism and the elimination of the semi-feudal system in rural areas. Our party must combine the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism with the specific conditions of Colombia, oppose the current main danger—various manifestations of modern revisionism—and oppose dogmatism, so as to build our party into a mass party with a strong proletarian base and capable of successfully solving future tasks ideologically and politically. In this struggle, our party must absorb the valuable experience of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries that have been built or are victoriously building socialism.

    哥伦比亚人民斗争的经验
    哥伦比亚“民主呼声报”总编辑  阿尔封索·罗麦罗·布格
    哥伦比亚共产党在独裁暴君罗哈斯·皮尼亚被推翻和共产党获得合法地位以后，就准备在今年12月召开第八次代表大会。从代表大会的酝酿和筹备工作中可以看出，哥伦比亚共产党在二十八年的历史中，特别是近十年来的斗争中所积累的经验，是异常丰富的。
    哥伦比亚曾遭到残酷的法西斯统治和血腥镇压。一千三百万的哥伦比亚人民，在不到八年的期间就被反动势力杀掉了二十万人，其中大部分是农民。在同一个时期，还有五万所房屋被烧毁，八百个村庄被夷平，千百万爱国民主人士受着压迫和折磨，工人阶级最优秀的领袖被监禁或屠杀。在血腥镇压政策的恶浪中，我们党失去了三位中央委员和成百名共产党员。面对着这种法西斯反动统治，哥伦比亚人民进行了坚决的反抗。
    这些苦难锻炼了人民，提高了他们的觉悟，并且使他们认清了到底谁是人民的敌人。
      美国的干涉和掠夺
    美帝国主义披着“泛美团结”的美丽外衣，对拉丁美洲残酷掠夺的凶恶面目，不仅在哥伦比亚，也在整个拉丁美洲被揭穿了。尼克松“访问”南美的可耻失败，就是个明证。在1947到1948年间，美国政府为了准备反对社会主义阵营的新战争，竭力扫清它的后方，并把拉丁美洲国家紧紧地拴在美国的战车上，并在这些国家中扶植对内实行法西斯统治，对外投靠美国的独裁政权。
    美帝国主义不止一次地侵略和干涉哥伦比亚。历史是最有力的见证人：1903年，哥伦比亚的巴拿马省，在美国的怂恿下，宣布脱离哥伦比亚独立。1948年美帝国主义又直接屠杀了在联合水果公司工作的香蕉工人。以后，美国又迫使哥伦比亚同美国签订双边军事协定。根据这个协定，美国的军事顾问团来到了哥伦比亚，指使和帮助反动政府对起义农民进行武装镇压。此外，美国还派遣了“技术顾问团”，掠夺哥伦比亚的民族资源和阻挠哥伦比亚民族经济的发展。
    帝国主义主要是美帝国主义，不断加强它对哥伦比亚经济的掠夺。哥伦比亚的石油资源大部分掌握在美孚油公司的手中。美国进口原油可以不用外汇，但是，在美国加工后再把汽油卖给哥伦比亚的时候，却一定要我们用美元付款。这种情况推动了石油国有化运动，这是国会正在讨论的一个问题。
    美帝国主义还用压低进口商品价格的政策来剥削哥伦比亚。由于占我国对外贸易70％的咖啡价格不断下跌，在最近三年中使我国每年损失两亿美元。由于出产咖啡的国家协议减少各国咖啡出口额以稳定咖啡价格，哥伦比亚不得不把咖啡生产减少15％，这就使我国每年要损失一亿五千万美元。咖啡问题在我国是一个严重的问题，要解决这个问题只有不顾美帝国主义的阻挠同社会主义阵营发展贸易关系。
    半封建的农业经济
    在哥伦比亚农村，还保留着封建的大庄园制度，这种制度限制了我国的经济发展。
    尽管在农民运动方面有着二十五年的斗争历史，但是，土地问题还是哥伦比亚的一个严重问题。根据官方故意缩小了的统计，占全体农户55％的五十万四千五百六十六户小土地占有者，只有九十二万七千一百二十四公顷的土地，即只占耕地的3.5％。而仅占全体农户0.44％的四千零四十五户地主，却占有一千一百二十六万四千零二十一公顷的土地，即占44.6％的土地，其中还不到0.03％的三百一十八户大封建主就占有了三百七十七万七千七百九十六公顷的土地，等于全部耕地的14.9％。此外，还有四百三十多万农民根本没有土地。他们替地主作雇工，工资低微，难以维持温饱。
    不断高涨的农民运动，反对这种封建制度。而封建主则同帝国主义勾结起来镇压农民运动。
        危机的解决
    哥伦比亚陷在深刻的危机中，这是依附于帝国主义和半封建半殖民地经济基础的必然结果。这种危机表现在生活费用惊人高涨（每月要上升4％），工资水平被冻结，失业激增（完全失业的达三十多万人）和工农业生产衰退等等。
    资产阶级在各项政革问题上表现得犹豫不决、顾虑重重。在独裁统治时代，资产阶级只有当独裁政府威胁到他们的传统利益（如收缩国内市场、浪费外汇）时，才作出一些反独裁的姿态。但是，当独裁政府允许他们限制工会运动、降低工人实际工资和用低价购买作为原料用的农产品时，资产阶级又对这个独裁政府加以支持。
    在这种情况下，只有哥伦比亚共产党提出的反帝反封建革命是解决危机的唯一道路。共产党主张，必须建立一个以工人阶级为领导，联合农民群众，有小资产阶级和民族资产阶级参加的广泛的“民族解放民主阵线”。
      工人阶级的情况
    在1932到1946年间，哥伦比亚工人阶级在共产党领导下，经过斗争获得了许多民主权利。在独裁政府首先挑起了原来统一于哥伦比亚工会联合会的工人运动的分裂以后，这些民主权利曾遭到反动政府的进攻和破坏。
    但是，拥有二十五万产业工人的哥伦比亚工人阶级一直为保卫自己的民主权利而斗争。今年的罢工斗争都获得了胜利。工会的数目也一天一天地在增长。广大的工人群众要求召开一次两个工会的团结大会，以便把工会的领导权从机会主义者的手中夺取过来。如果工会取得了组织上的团结，那就可以逐步使各个工会在行动上取得一致。农民运动和游击运动在法西斯恐怖政策面前，农民纷纷起来自卫。差不多在全国都出现了农民自卫队和游击队。经过许多次的战斗，农民学会了军事技术和军事策略，使游击队成为一支不可战胜的力量。尽管哥伦比亚政府军用美国提供的新式武器对游击队进行了无数次进攻，但是，游击队不但没有被“歼灭”，反而日益壮大。现在哥伦比亚有六支游击队，其中有四支是哥伦比亚共产党领导和组织的。在过去几年中，政府军根本没有攻入这四个游击根据地。
    哥伦比亚人民获得了民主自由权利之后，共产党建议把游击队的组织改为争取民主权利的组织，为争取土地改革、低利贷款和要求政府赔偿由于政府恐怖政策所造成的损失而斗争。同时，共产党还要求游击队在各地地区力争农业增产。但是，接受过去的经验，农民们不愿交出自己的武器，因为保有武器才能阻止再回到法西斯统治的道路上去。在即将举行的我党第八次代表大会上将提出一个巩固工农联盟的任务。
      人民斗争的前景
    由于工人阶级的分裂，资产阶级及其他反动势力的同盟领导了推翻独裁暴君罗哈斯·皮尼亚的人民运动，并且重新建立了共和国法制。人民对今年5月4日的总统选举结果还有过分的幻想，以为从此可以摆脱军国主义和独裁统治的危险，因而在一次公民投票中通过了所有的公职（国民大会、政府和司法机关的公职）都由自由党和保守党平分的规定。同时，尽管共产党取得了合法地位，享有选举权，却被剥夺了被选举权。
    争取完全的民主制度的斗争已经开始，并且取得了不少成果。在最近的选举中，尽管军事当局百般欺骗和威胁，共产党所提出的名单还是获得了十万张票。
    在哥伦比亚人民的斗争中，还要克服许多困难。帝国主义虽然已经名誉扫地，但是仍然在拉丁美洲使用阴谋诡计。但是，在近十年的斗争中，已经为我国人民和大陆上其他国家的人民提供了丰富的经验。在我党第八次代表大会上将着重指出把争取民主的斗争和反帝反封建的土地革命结合起来的斗争道路。
    磐石般团结的哥伦比亚共产党，完全拥护各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的宣言。在即将举行的我党第八次代表大会上，将制定一项扩大统一战线和团结群众的纲领，为把哥伦比亚从美帝国主义的控制下解放出来和清除农村中的半封建制度而斗争。我党在运用马克思列宁主义的基本原则时要结合哥伦比亚的具体情况，要反对目前的主要危险——现代修正主义的各种表现，反对教条主义，以便把我党建设成为一个群众性的、有强大无产阶级基础的、善于在思想上和政治上顺利解决将来任务的党。在这个斗争中，我党要吸收已经建成、或正在胜利建设社会主义社会的苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的宝贵经验。
