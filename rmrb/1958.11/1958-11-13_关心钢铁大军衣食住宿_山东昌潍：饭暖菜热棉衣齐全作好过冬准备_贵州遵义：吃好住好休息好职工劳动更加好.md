Caring for the Food, Clothing, Housing of the Steel Army
    Changwei, Shandong: Warm Food, Hot Dishes, Complete Cotton Clothing, Making Good Preparations for Winter; Zunyi, Guizhou: Good Food, Good Housing, Good Rest, Employees Work Even Better

    According to the Dazhong Daily, while striving for a complete victory in the decisive steel production month, leaders at all levels in the Changwei area of Shandong province have taken various measures to ensure that steelworkers are warm and well-fed through the winter, so that the blast furnaces continue to produce molten iron even in the cold season. To date, all 610,000 steelworkers in the region have been housed in winter-proof dwellings, and everyone has received cotton clothing.

    In mid-October, the county (city) Party committees all assigned cadres to specifically organize efforts to prepare for winter steel production. On the one hand, they mobilized farmers in villages near the construction sites to vacate some houses for steelworkers to live in; on the other hand, they organized specialized construction teams to rely on the masses and build more than 11,300 employee dormitories through self-reliance, so that all 610,000 steelworkers in the region could live in winter-proof dwellings. The people's communes in Pingdu County took the initiative to organize labor to send wooden poles, sorghum stalks, and wheat straw to the steel construction sites. The county Party committee also extracted two regiments from the water conservancy teams to build dormitories for the steelworkers. The county built more than 1,300 earth houses in ten days. The workers of the Weifang Steel Plant No. 3 displayed a high degree of revolutionary vigor, using production gaps to build their own dormitories, and adopted the method of rammed earth walls to overcome the difficulty of insufficient wood and sorghum stalks, building more than 100 earth houses. While rushing to build dormitories for the steelworkers, various localities also actively organized sewing and processing labor to make cotton clothing for the steelworkers, and tried to send the cotton clothing to the construction sites. Seven thousand nine hundred and ten workers in the region who lacked money to make cotton clothing were also appropriately resolved through advance wage payments and relief. The various steel construction sites have also improved site life management to ensure that workers eat well and have enough to eat. In Changyi County, large collective dining units at steel construction sites have been appropriately reduced in size, generally ensuring that each combat company has its own kitchen, thereby overcoming the phenomenon of workers eating in crowded conditions, spending too much time, and eating cold food. The workers reacted well.

    This newspaper reports that in the past few months, the Dongfeng Iron Plant in Nanbai District, Zunyi County, has carried out a great deal of work in improving the living and working conditions of its employees, and has achieved significant results. This plant was built on a large barren slope. Some of the cadres and workers lived in a few civilian houses two or three li away from the construction site, while most lived in small grass sheds, and some even slept in the pine forest in the open. After the basic construction of the furnace was completed, the plant leaders mobilized the masses to solve the housing problem themselves. The plant built two or three hundred large and small thatched houses and sheds, distributed around the workshops and blast furnaces, making it convenient for workers to live in, and they could go to the thatched houses and sheds to rest after work at night. They sang: "Small pine branches as roof frames, topped with golden silk tiles, cool in summer and warm in winter, neither cold nor hot, better than home." The people's communes cared about the steelworkers, and recently dismantled fifteen old houses from various villages and transported them to the vicinity of the construction site to rebuild them; at the same time, the plant is also building a new batch of earth-walled houses. The housing difficulties of the plant's employees have been initially resolved.

    In terms of diet, the Nanbai District Committee of the Communist Party of China specially appointed the director of the district warehouse and cadres from the supply and marketing cooperative to work at the plant as general affairs staff. A grain supply station was added near the plant. The plant and the nearby commune production teams have established relations, with the production teams regularly supplying vegetables, cooking oil, and pork. In order to improve the quality of food, the plant has changed the past large collective dining hall into small canteens in separate areas, with a total of twenty-two canteens in the plant, and a feast is held every ten days, which the workers are satisfied with. There is also a material supply department and mobile sales stalls in the plant. As the weather is getting colder, the plant Party committee, under the instructions of the district committee, has organized fifty-one sewing machines and more than two hundred processing workers in Nanbai District to make cotton clothes and quilts for the iron plant workers.

    关心钢铁大军衣食住宿
    山东昌潍：饭暖菜热棉衣齐全作好过冬准备  贵州遵义：吃好住好休息好职工劳动更加好
    据大众日报消息　山东昌潍专区各级领导在为夺取钢铁决战月全胜的同时，多方采取措施，保证钢铁战士饱暖过冬，使高炉在寒冬季节依然铁水畅流。到目前为止，全区六十一万钢铁大军都住上了过冬房屋，人人棉衣有了着落。
    10月中旬，各县（市）委都抽调了部分干部负责具体组织力量，为寒冬钢铁生产做准备。他们一面在工地附近村庄动员农民调出部分房屋，为钢铁战士住宿；一面组织专门建筑力量，依靠群众，自力更生，抢建起一万一千三百多间职工宿舍，使全区的六十一万钢铁战士都住上了过冬房屋。平度县各人民公社都主动组织力量，把木杆、秫秸、麦穰等物料送到钢铁工地，县委还从水利队伍中抽出两个团为钢铁战士抢建宿舍。全县十天时间就建起地屋一千三百多间。潍坊市钢铁三厂的工人们发挥了高度的革命干劲，利用生产空隙自己建筑宿舍，并全部采用土打墙的办法，克服木料、秫秸不足的困难，建起地屋一百多间。各地在抢建钢铁战士宿舍的同时，还积极组织缝纫加工力量为钢铁战士赶制棉衣，并设法把棉衣送到工地。全区有七千九百一十名工人做棉衣缺钱，也都通过预支工资和救济等办法适当加以解决。各钢铁工地也都改善了工地生活管理，保证工人吃好吃饱。昌邑县普遍把钢铁工地大伙食单位适当缩小，一般做到每个战斗连进一个伙房，从而克服了工人吃饭拥挤、时间过长和吃冷饭冷菜的现象。工人反映良好。
    本报讯　几个月来，遵义县南白区东风铁厂在改善职工生活和劳动条件方面，进行了许多工作，收到显著效果。这个厂是在一个大荒坡上建立起来的。干部和工人一部分住在距工地两三里远的几间民房里，大部分则是住在小草棚内，甚至有的在松林中露宿。建炉基本结束，厂领导就发动群众自己动手解决住宿问题。全厂修搭起两三百座大小茅屋和茅棚，分布在各车间各高炉周围，工人住宿方便了，晚上下班就到茅棚、茅屋里休息。他们唱：“小小松枝当屋架，头上盖的金丝瓦，夏天凉爽冬又暖，不冷不热赛老家。”人民公社关心钢铁工人，最近从各村寨拆了十五幢旧房屋，运到工地周围重新盖起来；同时厂里还在新盖一批土墙的房屋。全厂职工宿舍困难问题初步得到了解决。
    在饮食方面，中共南白区委专门抽了区仓库主任、供销社干部多人，到厂担任总务工作。在厂附近增设了粮食供应站。厂里和附近公社生产队都建立了关系，定期由生产队供应蔬菜、食油和猪肉。为了改进伙食质量，全厂将过去的大伙食团，改为分片的小食堂，全厂共建立了二十二个食堂，十天打一次牙祭，工人满意。在厂里还设有物资供应部，流动售货摊等。天气渐冷，厂党委在区委指示下，组织了南白区五十一部缝纫机，二百多加工工人，为铁厂工人赶制棉衣棉被。
