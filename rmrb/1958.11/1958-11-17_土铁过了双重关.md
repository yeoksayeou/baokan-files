    Indigenous Iron Passes the Double Test
    Currently, modern steel mills and machine manufacturing plants are encountering a technical problem of "using indigenous iron," which is how to refine large quantities of indigenous iron into steel or make good machine castings. The technical problem of using indigenous iron to make steel has now been broken through; the problem of using indigenous iron to make castings has also been successfully researched by scientific personnel. This experimental achievement has opened up broad avenues for the large-scale utilization of indigenous iron.
    The sulfur content of pig iron used for casting must not exceed one-thousandth. If the sulfur is too high, the casting will become white cast iron, brittle, and unusable. People have always considered this an unbreakable rule. Some people believe that they can only act in accordance with this rule and cannot make any changes. Is this opinion correct? Of course not. What is a rule? A correct rule is a person's understanding of the inherent laws of objective things. Understanding is not completely achieved in one go. With the deepening of people's practice, people can not only supplement and develop their understanding of these laws, but also discover new laws. Doesn't the example of the Machinery Manufacturing and Technology Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building researching the use of indigenous iron to make castings fully illustrate this principle? They discovered in their experiments that castings made of high-sulfur indigenous iron, although white cast iron when cast, have performance close to that of ductile iron castings after short-term annealing. They also found in their experiments that the high sulfur in indigenous iron can accelerate the graphitization of iron into spheroids during annealing, that is, it acts as the spheroidizing agent – magnesium – in ductile iron and shortens the annealing time. In this way, they transformed the harmful factor of high sulfur into a beneficial factor.
    The fact that good castings can be made from indigenous iron with very high sulfur content once again eloquently proves the great significance of Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching to liberate our minds and break superstitions. Which of the many examples of the rapid development of the national economy and science and technology in our country this year is not the result of liberating the mind and breaking superstitions? Science and technology originate from social practice and material production. Only if scientific and technological research work has a daring and enterprising style, closely integrates with production, and serves socialist construction, can it grasp and discover new laws and open up infinitely broad fields for scientific and technological research work.

    土铁过了双重关
    目前，现代化的炼钢厂和机器制造厂都碰到一个“吃土铁”的技术问题，也就是怎样使大量的土铁能够炼成钢或做成好的机器铸件。土铁炼钢的技术问题，现在已经被人们突破了；用土铁做成铸件问题，也已经被科学人员研究成功了。这种试验成就，给大量利用土铁开辟了广阔道路。
    铸造用的生铁含硫不得超过千分之一，硫高了，铸件便成白口，发脆，不能用。人们一向认为这是一条牢不可破的规程。有些人认为只能按照这个规程办事，不能有任何改变。这个意见对不对呢？当然不对。规程是什么呢？正确的规程是人们对客观事物内在规律的一种认识。认识不是一次就很完全的。随着人们实践的深入，人们不但可以补充和发展对这些规律的认识，而且还可以发现新的规律。一机部机械制造与工艺科学研究院研究用土铁做铸件的例子不是充分地说明这个道理吗？他们在试验中发现，用高硫土铁做的铸件，虽然在铸造时为白口，但经过短期退火以后，它的性能却接近于球墨铸铁铸件。他们在试验中还发现：土铁中的高硫在退火中可以加速铁中的石墨球化，即起球墨铸铁中球化剂——镁的作用，并且缩短退火时间。这样他们就把高硫这一有害因素转变为有利因素。
    用含硫很高的土铁一样可以做出很好的铸件，这件事，再一次雄辩地证明毛泽东同志教导我们解放思想、破除迷信这一句话的巨大意义。我们国家今年以来国民经济和科学技术飞跃发展的许多事例，有哪一样不是解放思想、破除迷信的结果？科学技术来源于社会实践和物质生产。科学技术研究工作只有具有敢想敢干的风格，密切结合生产，为社会主义建设服务，才能掌握和发现新的规律，给科学技术研究工作开辟无限广阔的天地。
