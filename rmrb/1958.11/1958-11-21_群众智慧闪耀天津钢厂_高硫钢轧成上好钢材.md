Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 20th: The Tianjin Steel Plant's structural steel mill, focusing on the wisdom of its workers, has overcome the challenge of high-sulfur steel, successfully rolling steel ingots with high sulfur content into high-quality steel. The steel they use has a sulfur content as high as 0.3%, with manganese content exceeding sulfur by more than double, and the yield rate reaches 90%, even as high as 100%.

Starting in October this year, the Tianjin Steel Plant began using domestically produced iron to make steel on a large scale, which significantly increased the sulfur content of the steel. When rolling this high-sulfur steel, many steel ingots would shatter into small pieces, turning into "tofu dregs" as they went through the rolling mill. On October 20th, the structural steel mill test-rolled seven to eight tons of high-sulfur steel, all of which became scrap. How to roll high-sulfur steel into usable material became a critical problem for the entire plant. At the time, some people believed that rolling this kind of steel was a waste of time and materials. They insisted that "you can't make good porridge without good rice" and "you can't roll good material without good steel." The question facing the structural steel mill was: either mobilize the masses to overcome the difficulties of rolling high-sulfur steel and change the situation of high scrap rates, or shut down the rolling mill and wait for steel with a lower sulfur content to be produced. The plant's Party General Branch Committee affirmed the former path and, in light of the plant's specific circumstances, conducted a thorough discussion and study of the high-sulfur steel rolling problem, deciding to deeply mobilize the masses. They adopted the methods of special forums and special debates to liberate thought and break down superstitions, in order to encourage workers to carry out technical innovations and break through the high-sulfur steel barrier.

Subsequently, the Party General Branch Secretary convened cadres, engineers, technicians, and workers for meetings, extensively mobilizing the masses to launch three debates, examining and criticizing various conservative ideas and negative complaining sentiments. Through debate, everyone's thinking was clarified, and it was clear that this was not only a general economic task but also a top priority; fulfilling the steel production quota was not enough; good steel had to be rolled out to be considered a complete task. The workers said: The iron has already been made into steel; if we rolling workers cannot turn the steel into material, it is the greatest waste. During the forums and debates, many experienced veteran workers shared their carefully observed insights. Veteran worker Fang Xueming pointed out that crushing and cracking often occurred at the beginning and in the middle of the ingot rolling process, but later on, they were less likely to crack; he found that the later ingots did not crack because the heating temperature was lower. Veteran worker Chen Mingren said: When heating high-sulfur steel, it is necessary to master the appropriate temperature according to the sulfur content. The workers reached a consensus: the temperature should not be too high, and the heating time should be checked to ensure that the steel is heated evenly inside and out. In addition, after discussion, technicians also proposed changing the size of steel ingots, changing the rolling groove, reducing the amount of pressure, and increasing the manganese content during steelmaking.

The Party General Branch concentrated the large number of opinions put forward by the workers, then handed them back to the masses for discussion, and organized leading cadres, workers, and technicians in a three-way combination to carry out experimental plots. The broad masses of workers actively responded to the Party's call, putting forward the bold slogan: "Even with inferior rice, we must make good porridge; even with inferior steel, we must roll good material." The workers studied the technology day and night beside the heating furnace and rolling mill. After continuous experimentation, they finally found a method to control the heating temperature and heating time according to the different sulfur content of the steel, thus providing an operational basis for rolling high-sulfur steel. Due to the increase in the yield rate, the steel production of this plant is increasing daily.

### 群众智慧闪耀天津钢厂  高硫钢轧成上好钢材

    群众智慧闪耀天津钢厂
    高硫钢轧成上好钢材
    据新华社天津20日电　天津钢厂的型钢厂集中职工群众智慧，闯过高硫钢的关，用含硫量较高的钢锭轧制成好钢材。他们用的钢含硫量高达千分之三，含锰量大于硫一倍以上，而轧制成材率达到了90％甚至高达100％。
    天津钢厂从今年10月份起大量用土铁炼钢，钢的含硫量大大增加。这种高硫钢在轧制的时候，许多钢锭从轧钢机这头进去到了那头，就碎成了小块，变成“豆腐渣”。10月20日型钢厂试轧了七吨到八吨的高硫钢，全部成为废品。如何把高硫钢轧制成材，成了全厂一大关键问题。当时有些人认为：轧这种钢白浪费时间、白浪费材料。他们认定“没有好米做不出好粥”、“没有好钢轧不出好材”。这时摆在型钢厂面前的问题是：或者是发动群众克服高硫钢轧制的困难，改变废品多的状况；或者是把轧钢机停下来，何时炼出含硫不多的钢何时再轧。这个厂的党总支委员会肯定了前一条道路，并且结合本厂具体情况专门对高硫钢轧制问题作了充分讨论研究，决定深入发动群众。他们采取专题鸣放专题辩论的办法，解放思想破除迷信，以带动职工大搞技术革新，突破高硫钢的难关。
    接着，党总支书记分别召集干部、工程技术人员同工人开会，广泛发动群众展开了三次辩论，检查和批判各种保守思想及消极埋怨情绪。通过辩论，大家思想豁亮了，明确了这不仅是一般的经济任务，而且是头等重要任务；钢产量完成了还必须轧制出好钢材才算完成任务。工人们说：铁已成钢，我们轧材工人不能使钢成材就是最大的浪费。在鸣放辩论中，许多经验丰富的老工人，把日常细心观察的心得，都谈了出来。老工人方学鸣指出，轧碎轧裂，往往是开始和中间那些锭子，而轧到后面就不大碎裂；他发现后面那些锭子不碎裂，是因为加温较低的缘故。老工人陈鸣仁说：加热烘高硫钢，必须根据含硫高低情况，掌握确当。工人得出一致的意见是：温度不可过高，并且应该检查加温时间，使钢内外加热均匀。另外，技术人员经过讨论，还提出了改变钢锭尺寸，改变轧辊孔槽，减小压下量，以及炼钢时增加含锰量等办法。
    党总支把职工群众提出的这些大量的意见集中起来，再交给群众讨论，并且组织领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合，大搞试验田。广大职工群众积极响应党的号召，提出了豪迈的口号：“次米也要做成好粥，次钢也要轧成好材”。职工们不分昼夜地在烘钢炉旁、轧钢机旁钻研技术。经过连续试验，终于找出了根据钢的不同含硫量控制加热温度与加热时间的办法，这样便使得高硫钢轧制有了操作依据。由于成材率的上升，这个厂的钢材产量正在逐日提高。
