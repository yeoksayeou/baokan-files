Xinhua News Agency, 11th, Tokyo dispatch: According to a report in today's "Akahata," nearly thirty prefectures and counties in Japan have now established joint struggle organizations including the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Based on the unified action of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, they are launching struggles against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," demanding the opening of Sino-Japanese relations, demanding the dissolution of the Diet, and demanding the overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

	In the Kanto region, Gunma Prefecture, on the 7th, established a permanent unified action organization – the "Prefectural Federation for the Protection of Democracy." Participating in this organization are fifty-one labor unions such as the Gunma Prefectural Council of Trade Unions, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Farmers' Association, the Gunma Prefectural Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, and more than twenty other democratic and peace organizations. The basic struggle program of this Prefectural Federation is: In order to safeguard democracy and peace, we will do our best to carry out struggles against the Kishi Nobusuke government's destruction of democracy under the guise of anti-communism, and all reactionary conspiracies to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and revise the Japanese Constitution.

	The program believes that a series of measures such as the "Work Performance Rating" system, the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment," and the relaxation of the "Anti-Monopoly Law" are policies to step up war preparations. Therefore, they will fight to the end to crush these reactionary policies and will carry out a long-term struggle to establish a democratic politics.

	In the Kanto region, joint struggle organizations including the Communist Party or the Socialist Party and labor unions have also been established in Ibaraki, Tochigi, Yamanashi, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama prefectures.

	The Hokkaido Joint Struggle Liaison Conference against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," participated by the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and labor unions, farmers, women, fishermen, students, peace organizations, and cultural figures, was established on October 21, and held a grand prefectural people's uprising conference in Sapporo on the joint struggle day of November 5.

	Joint struggle organizations have also been established successively in Miyagi Prefecture in the Tohoku region and Niigata and Nagano Prefectures in the Hokuriku region. In Osaka, since the launch of the struggle against the "Work Performance Rating" system, joint struggle organizations at the district level have been rapidly organized.

	In the Kyushu region, joint struggles in Kumamoto, Oita, Miyazaki, and Fukuoka prefectures are also becoming increasingly active, starting with the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

	Even the Shimane Prefectural Federation of Youth Groups, controlled by the Liberal Democratic Party, has joined the joint struggle organization in Shimane Prefecture in the Chugoku region. Also participating in this organization is the Food Store Association. Joint struggle conferences have also been established in other prefectures such as Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, Okayama, and Tottori.

	In Tokyo, a Central Joint Struggle Conference has been established. Joint struggle organizations at the district level have also been established in various districts. Communists in these district organizations have always stood at the forefront of the struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th, Tokyo dispatch: As the unprecedented struggle of the Japanese people against the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" continues to develop, Japanese monopoly capital groups have expressed dissatisfaction with the Kishi Nobusuke government's "clumsy approach" of forcibly extending the Diet session in order to quickly pass this fascist bill, and have expressed concern about the resulting standstill of the Diet's functions and the future of the Kishi Nobusuke government in its besieged situation.

	According to a broadcast by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation on the 10th, the board of directors of monopoly capitalist groups such as the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations and the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations invited Aoki Tadashi, Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, and others to explain the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" and expressed clear support for the Kishi Nobusuke government's reactionary bill to suppress the Japanese people, especially the Japanese working class. However, in the current situation, which is very unfavorable to the Kishi Nobusuke government, some people within the monopoly capital groups, who are the backers of the Kishi Nobusuke government, have also "severely criticized Kishi Nobusuke's 'sudden' introduction of this amendment, saying that this is Kishi Nobusuke's bureaucratic and clumsy approach."

	The radio broadcast said that these monopoly capitalists considered that "if they themselves came forward to carry out certain activities on this issue, the result would put the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party in a disadvantageous position and instead put the Socialist Party and other progressive camps in an advantageous position." The radio said, "However, with the government and the ruling party's extension of the extraordinary session of the Diet as a turning point, the functions of the Diet have completely stalled, and abnormal situations have occurred in the Diet. Therefore, the financial and business community is beginning to worry about the future of the conservative regime."

	According to the radio broadcast, monopoly capitalists such as Kobayashi Tadashi, President of the Japan Development Bank, have already planned for the Kishi Nobusuke group, believing that the Kishi Nobusuke group should currently adopt a delaying tactic and postpone the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" to the next Diet session for continued deliberation. These capitalists believe that in the current extremely unfavorable situation, the Kishi Nobusuke government should make concessions and try to restore the Diet to normal as soon as possible.

	The radio said: "People in the financial and business community secretly judge that if the abnormal state of the Diet continues, the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet will face a situation of resigning en masse or dissolving the Diet, which may lead to the development of progressive forces, which the financial and business community is most worried about, and even worse situations. Some people in the financial and business community even say that Kishi Nobusuke should seize the opportunity as soon as possible and resign from the presidency of the Liberal Democratic Party."

	According to the broadcast, the anxious Japanese monopoly capitalists are also very concerned about the Socialist Party's scheduled extraordinary convention on the 12th, fearing that the Socialist Party will become even tougher after holding this convention. According to the radio, the Federation of Economic Organizations will also hold a standing board meeting to exchange views on the so-called issue of promoting the restoration of the Diet to normal.

    团结一致要求解散国会和打倒岸内阁
    日本各地建立共同斗争组织
    垄断资本集团对局势发展表示严重不安
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，目前在日本有将近三十个府、县单位已经成立了包括社会党和共产党在内的共同斗争组织，并以社会党和共产党的统一行动为基础，正在展开反对修改“警察官职务执行法”、要求打开日中关系、要求解散国会和打倒岸信介内阁的斗争。
    关东地方的群马县，7日成立了持久性的统一行动组织——“拥护民主主义县民联合会”。参加这个组织的有群马县工会地方评议会等五十一个工会和社会党、共产党、农民协会、群马县学生自治会联合会以及其它二十多个民主团体与和平团体。这个县民联合会的基本斗争纲领是：为了维护民主与和平，将竭尽全力展开斗争，反对岸信介政府假借反共的名义破坏民主，修改日美“安全条约”和修改日本宪法的一切反动阴谋。
    纲领认为，“勤务评定”制度、“警察官职务执行法修正案”、放宽“禁止垄断法”等一系列的措施都是加紧备战的政策，因此，他们将为粉碎这些反动政策而斗争到底，并且要为确立民主政治进行长期的斗争。
    关东地方的茨城、櫔木、山梨、神奈川、千叶和埼玉等县也都成立了包括共产党或者社会党和工会在内的共同斗争组织。
  由社会党、共产党和工会、农民、妇女、渔民、学生、和平团体以及文化界人士参加的北海道反对修改“警察官职务执行法”共同斗争联络会议已在10月21日成立，并且在11月5日的联合斗争日在札幌市举行了盛大的县民奋起大会。
    东北地方的宫城县和北陆地方的新泻县、长野县也都相继成立了共同斗争组织。在大阪，自从展开反对“勤务评定”制度的斗争以来，以区为单位的共同斗争组织就迅速组织起来。
    九州地方的熊本、大分、宫崎和福冈等县的共同斗争，也以反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争为起点而日益趋向活跃。
    甚至自由民主党控制的岛根县青年团联合会也参加了中国地方岛根县的共同斗争组织，参加这个组织的还有伙食店铺协会。山口、广岛、冈山、鸟取等其它各县也都成立了共同斗争会议。
    在东京，已经成立了中央共同斗争会议。各区也都成立了以区为单位的共同斗争组织。在这些区的组织里的共产党员们一直站在斗争的最前列。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：在日本人民反对“警察官职务执行法修正案”的规模空前的斗争继续发展的情况下，日本垄断资本集团已经对岸信介政府强行延长国会会期以迅速通过这一法西斯法案的“笨拙做法”表示不满，并且对岸信介集团由此而造成的国会机能停顿的局面和岸信介政府在四面楚歌形势下的前途表示担心。
  据日本广播协会电台10日广播，日本经济团体联合会，日本经营者团体联盟等垄断资本家团体的理事会曾经邀请国家公安委员会委员长青木正等就“警察官职务执行法修正案”作了说明，并且表示明确支持岸信介政府这一镇压日本人民，特别是镇压日本工人阶级的反动法案。但是，在目前形势对岸信介政府非常不利的情况下，作为岸信介政府后台老板的垄断资本集团内部，也有人对岸信介“突然”提出这个修正案的做法“进行相当严厉的批评，说这是岸信介的官僚主义的笨拙的做法”。
    这家电台广播说，这些垄断资本家们考虑到，他们“如果自己出马在这个问题上进行某些活动，结果将会使岸信介政府和自由民主党处于不利的地位，反而会使社会党等革新阵营处于有利的地位。”电台说，“可是，以政府和执政党延长国会临时会议会期为转折点，国会的机能完全停顿，并且发生了国会不正常情况，因此，金融实业界，开始担心起保守政权的前途来了。”
    据这家电台广播，像日本开发银行总经理小林中等垄断资本家已经替岸信介集团策划，认为岸信介集团目前应该采取缓兵之计，把“警察官职务执行法修正案”搁置到下一次国会会议去继续审议。这些资本家们认为，在目前极端不妙的情势下，岸信介政府应该让步，并且设法尽早使国会恢复正常。
    这家电台说：“金融实业界人士暗地里都这样判断：如果国会不正常的状态继续下去，岸信介内阁将会碰到全体辞职或者解散国会的局面，说不定会造成金融实业界最担心的革新势力的发展和比这更坏的情况。在金融实业界中甚至有人说岸信介应该尽早抓住机会，引咎辞去自由民主党总裁的职务。”
    据广播，焦急万分的日本垄断资本家们还对社会党预定在12日举行的临时大会非常关心，担心社会党在举行这次大会以后会变得更加强硬。据电台说，经济团体联合会也要举行常任理事会议，来就所谓促使国会恢复正常的问题交换意见。
