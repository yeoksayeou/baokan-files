    Copper: Assistant to the "Marshal" and "Pioneer"
    Wang Zhenyuan
    Copper is a capable assistant to the mechanical "marshal" and the electrical "pioneer," occupying a very important position in socialist industrialization.
    One of its most significant characteristics is its strong electrical conductivity. It also possesses ductility, making it an important raw material in the motor industry. Generators, motors, electrical wires, electric fans, electric lights, telephones, etc., all require copper. Without large quantities of copper, achieving electrification is unimaginable.
    Copper alloys have high hardness and are corrosion-resistant, making them superior to iron. In the machinery industry, many important parts such as castings, bearings, pipelines, and gears for precision instruments cannot do without it. Manufacturing a Liberation brand automobile requires approximately twenty-one kilograms of copper. Without copper, the mechanical "marshal" cannot set up camp.
    In military affairs and architectural decoration, copper and its alloys are indispensable.
    China is very rich in copper mines. The imperialist countries used to say that China was poor in copper, which is nonsense. According to preliminary estimates, China's copper reserves have already exceeded those of the world's largest copper-producing country—Chile.
    The composition of copper ore is very complex. There are generally two types: one is oxide copper ore, from which copper smelting is very simple, like iron smelting, requiring only reduction with coke. Most copper ores are sulfide copper and iron sulfide types, with many impurities mixed in.
    To extract copper from sulfide copper and iron sulfide type copper ores, the first step is to remove a large portion of the non-metallic impurities, which is called ore dressing. Ore dressing can be done using gravity methods, which involves placing finely ground ore in water. Because the minerals are heavy and the rocks are light, the impurities floating on the surface are removed, like panning for rice. However, the best method is froth flotation. The finely ground ore powder is placed in a mixture of special oil and water, and vigorously stirred, then air is blown in, which generates a large amount of foam. The foam, with the help of the oil, tends to stabilize, and the useful part of the ore is surrounded by it and floats on the surface, while the impurities sink to the bottom. This separation is very precise, and the result is called refined copper concentrate.
    The first step in smelting refined copper concentrate into copper is to treat the refined copper concentrate with hot air to remove a portion of the sulfur and to agglomerate the ore. The second step is to heat the product with coke and flux. At this time, a portion of the impurities will be oxidized and combine with the flux to form slag that floats on the surface, leaving a mixture of cuprous sulfide and iron sulfide, also mixed with small amounts of gold, silver, and other impurities. The third step is to place the product in a converter similar to a steelmaking converter, add a small amount of sand, and blow in hot air. In this way, the remaining sulfur continues to turn into sulfur dioxide, and the iron turns into silicate slag, which is removed, leaving behind crude copper.
    Extremely pure copper is needed in the motor industry, as crude copper increases resistance, which is detrimental to conductivity. Therefore, further refining is necessary. This involves continuing to oxidize the crude copper to remove impurities, and then reducing it with coke. This can yield 99.7% copper. Electrolysis can also be used. The crude copper is used as the anode, and thin pure copper coated with graphite is used as the cathode, placed in a copper sulfate solution. The result of passing an electric current is that the copper on the anode moves to the cathode, while the impurities precipitate or are preserved in the solution. This process can result in copper reaching 99.99% purity.

    铜：“元帅”和“先行”的助手
    王震元
    铜是机械“元帅”和电力“先行”的得力助手，在社会主义工业化中占有非常重要的地位。
    它的一个最显著的特点就是强大的导电性，同时它还具有延展性，所以成为电机工业上的重要原料。发电机、电动机、电线、电扇、电灯、电话机等都需要用铜。没有大量的铜，要实现电气化是不能设想的。
    铜的合金具有很高的硬度并且能耐腐蚀，这是它优于铁的地方。在机械工业中许多重要的零件如：铸件、轴承、管路、精密仪器的齿轮等都离不开它。制造一辆解放牌汽车，约需要二十一公斤的铜。没有铜，机械“元帅”也升不了帐。
    在军事上、建筑装饰上都少不了铜和它的合金。
    我国的铜矿非常丰富，以前帝国主义国家说我国贫铜，那是胡说。据初步测定，我国的铜藏量已经超过了世界上产铜最多的国家——智利。
    铜矿的成分很复杂。大体上有二个类型，一个是氧化铜型，从中炼铜很简单，和炼铁一样，只要用焦炭还原就行了。大部分的铜矿是硫化铜、硫化铁类型的，里边还夹了许多杂质。
    要从硫化铜、硫化铁类型的铜矿中炼铜，首先要将一大部分的非金属杂质除掉，这叫做选矿。选矿可以采取重力法，就是将研细的矿石放在水里，因为矿物重，岩石轻，好像淘米一样，把浮在上面的杂质除去了。但最好的是采取泡沫浮选法。将研细的矿粉置于特殊的油和水的混合液中，用力搅拌，然后吹入空气，这样就会产生大量的泡沫。泡沫靠了油的帮助趋于安定，矿石的有用部分被它包围起来而浮在上面，杂质则沉到了底下。这样分离的精密度很高，称为精铜矿。
    把精铜矿冶炼成铜，第一步是将精铜矿用热空气处理，以除去一部分的硫，并使矿石结块。第二步是将产品同焦炭，熔剂一同加热、这时一部分杂质就会被氧化而与熔剂结合成熔渣浮在上面，下面的是硫化亚铜和硫化铁的混合物，也还夹杂有少量的金银等杂质。第三步是将产物放在同炼钢相似的转炉内，加入少量的砂，吹入热空气。这样剩余的硫继续变成二氧化硫，铁变成硅酸盐的熔渣除去。留下来的就是粗铜。
    在电机工业上需要极纯的铜，粗铜会增加电阻，对导电不利。所以必须进一步的精制。就是将粗铜继续氧化，除去杂质，然后再用焦炭去还原它。这样可得到99.7％的铜。还可以用电解的方法。将粗铜当作阳极，涂有石墨的薄纯铜当作阴极，放在硫酸铜的溶液中，通以电流的结果，阳极上的铜就会跑到阴极上去，而杂质沉淀下来，或者保存在溶液之中。这样处理的结果，可以使铜达到99.99％的纯度。
