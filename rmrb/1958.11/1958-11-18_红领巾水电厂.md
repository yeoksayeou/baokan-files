    Young Pioneers Hydroelectric Plant
    Lin Zeng
    The campus of Xichuan Elementary School in Linxia City, Gansu Province, was crowded with adults and children, watching with tension and excitement as green water flowed from the canal, driving the water turbine and generating electricity. Hou Wanxiang, the Young Pioneers squad leader, stood in the machine room and solemnly flipped the switch. In an instant, all the lights on campus lit up, and the children shouted excitedly: "The Young Pioneers Hydroelectric Plant is generating electricity!"
    Who built this hydroelectric plant? These children did.
    Last August, fifth-grade students did a water turbine experiment in a natural science class. The children were very interested to see the water driving the water turbine to rotate rapidly, and they heard the instructor say that the Linxia Minsheng Hydroelectric Plant generates electricity using water power. An ideal arose in the children's minds: How wonderful it would be if they could make a generator and build a hydroelectric plant themselves!
      How to do it? The children knew how to rely on the collective, and they formed bricklaying, carpentry, electrical, and ironworking groups. The first step was to make a generator. This task fell to the electrical group led by thirteen-year-old Hou Wanxiang. The instructor brought a wall chart of a hand-cranked generator, which was the only technical material. The children drew drawings according to the pattern and went to iron factories and bicycle factories to find waste screws and waste axles, and the power plant sent waste enameled wire and waste wires… When the generator was installed, they tested it in the school's canal, but it did not generate electricity. Some children were disappointed and said, "Generators are not simple; this is not something we children can do; this is a matter for adults." Hou Wanxiang thought to himself: If adults can make generators, why can't children do it? As long as it is done correctly, it will definitely generate electricity. So, after school every day, he went to check the generator for problems, and gradually a large group of children went with him to surround the generator, all worrying about the machine's "illness." Hou Wanxiang decided to disassemble it and reinstall it. After installation, the result of the test was still no electricity. He was not discouraged by the second failure, and he continued to do several detailed inspections, and everything was the same as drawn on the drawing, with no differences. Finally, they asked the older brothers and sisters of the Minsheng Hydroelectric Plant to do an inspection and found that the generator's speed was too low, not reaching 2,000 revolutions per minute. To increase the speed, they took the old ball bearings from a broken bicycle and installed them. The speed exceeded the requirement, but still no electricity was generated. The older brothers and sisters from Minsheng Hydroelectric Plant could not find the reason either. At this time, they requested the brigade headquarters to write to factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Harbin, and other places for help.
    A week later, replies came from all over, all expressing their willingness to help. The children got in touch with the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, which manufactured generators, and sent their generator and drawings. A reply came from the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, revealing that they had wound the coils incorrectly. The electric motor factory also replaced them with a generator base plate that was not easily damp and replaced some parts. The generator was successfully made.
    With the generator, the Young Pioneers Hydroelectric Plant's project immediately began in full swing. If they did not have tools, the children made them themselves; if they did not have bricks, they burned their own kilns. After the generator was installed, there was no switch to control the power supply, and light bulbs were often burned out. Hou Wanxiang and the others carefully observed the structure of the switches on the agricultural cooperative's broadcaster and made six types of switches using flattened iron nails instead of iron sheets. As soon as they finished class, they immediately entered their respective construction sites. Even the first-grade pupils did not show weakness, automatically taking on the task of transportation. To meet the requirements of the power plant, the water level needed to be raised, so they raised and widened the entire 50-meter-long canal by one foot. At the same time, they compacted the dikes, leveled the slopes, planted flowers, trees, and also built a fish pond and a rockery, completing the entire basic construction project of the power plant.
    Since then, the Xichuan Elementary School has been continuously lit by electric lights "lit" by the Young Pioneers themselves.

    红领巾水电厂
    林曾
    甘肃省临夏市西川小学的校园里，挤满了大人和孩子，他们怀着又紧张、又兴奋的心情，看着绿色的水从渠里流下，冲动了水轮，发出了电力。站在机房里的少先队中队长侯万祥，神色庄严地启动了开关。一霎那间，校园里的灯全亮了，孩子们高兴地叫了起来：“红领巾水电厂发电啦！”
    这个水电厂是谁修的呢？就是这些孩子们。
    还是去年8月里，五年级学生在一堂自然课上作了一次水轮实验。孩子们看到水冲动着水轮飞快地旋转，感到极大的兴趣，又听辅导员说，临夏市民生水电厂就是用水力发电的。孩子们的心灵里就产生了一个理想：要是自己做一架发电机，修一个水电厂，那该有多好！
      怎么做呢？孩子们懂得依靠集体，他们自己组成了砖工、木工、电工、铁工等小组。第一步是制作发电机。这个任务落在十三岁的侯万祥所领导的电工组身上。辅导员拿来了一张手摇发电机的挂图，这就是唯一的技术资料。孩子们按照图样画了图纸，分头到铁工厂、自行车厂找来了废螺丝和废轴，电厂送来了盘砂丝和废电线……。发电机安装完了，他们拿到校园的水渠里一试验，却发不出电来。有的孩子失望了，说：“发电机不简单，这不是我们小孩能做的，这是大人的事。”侯万祥听了，心想：大人能做发电机，小孩就不能做吗？只要做得对，就一定能发出电来。于是每天下课后，他就去检查发电机的毛病，逐渐地也有一大群孩子跟他一起去围着发电机转了，大家都在为这架机器的疾病担忧。侯万祥决定把它拆卸开来，重新安装。装好后，试验的结果还是发不出电。第二次的失败，他还是没有灰心，他又连续做了几次详细的检查，一切都跟图纸上画的一样，没有什么不同的地方。最后，他们请民生水电厂的哥哥姐姐们作了一次检查，发现发电机的转速太小，没有达到每分钟两千转。为了提高转速，他们又把一辆破自行车里的旧滚珠拿下来安了进去。转速是超过规定了，可是还发不出电来。民生水电厂的哥姐们也检查不出是什么原因。这时他们请求大队部向上海、天津、哈尔滨等地的工厂写信，要求帮助解决。
    一个星期后，各地的回信来了，他们都表示愿意帮助。孩子们同制造发电机的上海电机厂挂上了钩，把自己作的发电机和图纸寄了去。上海电机厂的回信来了，原来是他们把线圈绕错了。电机厂还替他们换上了一块不易受潮的发电机底板和换了一些零件。发电机制成功了。
    有了发电机，红领巾水电厂的工程也立刻全面动工了。没有工具，孩子们自己制造；没有砖头，自己烧窑。发电机安装起来后，没有开关，不能掌握电源，常常烧坏灯泡，侯万祥他们仔细观察了农业社广播器上的开关构造，用铁钉砸扁代替铁片做成了六种开关。他们只要一上完课，立即进入各自的工地。就是一年级的小学生也不示弱，自动担负起运输的任务。为了适合电厂的要求，需要提高水位，他们把全长五十公尺的水渠加高、加宽了一尺。同时，他们还夯实堤岸，打平坡面，种上花草、树木，还修了一个鱼池、一座假山，完成了发电厂的整个基本建设工程。
    从此，西川小学里一直亮着红领巾们自己“点燃”的电灯。
