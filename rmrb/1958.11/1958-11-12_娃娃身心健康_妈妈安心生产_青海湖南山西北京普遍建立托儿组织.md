According to the Qinghai Daily, as of now, Qinghai Province has more than 9,800 childcare organizations, with over 85% of eligible children enrolled. This plays a significant role in addressing the current labor shortage during the Great Leap Forward and strengthening early childhood education.

Party committees at all levels in Qinghai attach importance to the leadership of childcare organizations. The Communist Party Committee of Huangyuan County specifically appointed a county party secretary to be responsible for mass welfare work; and repeatedly emphasized the selection of nursery staff. Zou Yingcheng, the first secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Haibei Gangcha County's Ha'erge People's Commune, held more than six Party committee meetings to run the nursery well, and conducted multiple studies on the conditions for nursery staff. Song Lin, the first secretary of the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, publicized the importance of childcare work at the Prefecture Party Committee enlarged meeting and when he went to work in the counties under his jurisdiction, and emphasized the transfer of outstanding Party members and League members to work in nurseries. Regarding the idea of some township and commune cadres that "poor farmers and herdsmen cannot take care of babies," he launched a major debate among the masses, making everyone clearly aware that poor farmers and herdsmen have their lives guaranteed and no longer have to worry about eating and clothing, so they will definitely take good care of their babies, thereby implementing the class line in the work of running nurseries.

According to the New Hunan Daily, kindergartens and nurseries have been universally established in the vast rural areas of Hunan Province.

In the process of consolidating and improving childcare work, under the leadership of the Party committees and women's federations at all levels, many measures have been taken. The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture trained more than 4,400 nursery staff and childcare cadres. The Xiangyin County Party Committee included childcare work as part of the unified arrangement, inspection, and evaluation. In some communes in Jiahe County, Party and League branch secretaries, women's directors, parent representatives, and educators formed a childcare management committee and formulated regulations, putting forward specific requirements for educators and parents. Under the patient education of the educators, the children in care love collective life, and new moral qualities are gradually growing, which is welcomed by parents.

Relying on the masses to run nurseries and kindergartens diligently and thriftily is one of the important keys to further consolidating childcare work. Most kindergartens and nurseries are built using temples, ancestral halls, or dilapidated houses, and all equipment is simple and crude. The teachers of the No. 1 Brigade Kindergarten of the Dongtingwei Commune in Xiangyin County picked up many old pieces of wood to use as building blocks for the children and transported sand for the children to play with.

According to the Shanxi Daily, childcare organizations in Shanxi Province are developing rapidly. At present, more than 160,000 kindergartens and nurseries have been established in the province, and the total number of children under the age of seven in care accounts for more than 90% of the total number of children, thereby liberating more than 3.3 million women in the province from tedious housework and bravely putting them into various production fronts.

Under the slogan that taking good care of children and doing a good job in childcare is equally glorious, significant achievements have been made in childcare work in various places. Huting Township in Xiangqin County often pays attention to checking whether the food is thin, soft, fresh, and delicious in terms of children's food; in terms of accommodation and utensils, it often urges managers to do a good job in cleaning and hygiene. Since the establishment of child care organizations in Chaoying People's Commune in Pingshun County, the Party branch has included childcare work as an agenda item in its regular work. It regularly convenes nursery staff to conduct inspections, summaries, and exchange work experience, guides nursery staff to continuously improve their work methods, and encourages revolutionary enthusiasm of childcare staff by evaluating and commending advanced staff. Therefore, the children in care are all innocent, lively, love to work, and are very polite.

In order to completely liberate women's labor, many regions are currently rectifying childcare organizations, summarizing experiences, and evaluating advanced childcare workers.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Collective childcare has basically been realized in the suburbs of the capital. According to statistics, more than 27,800 childcare organizations have been established in the suburbs, with a total of more than 387,000 children in care, accounting for 83% of preschool children.

The vigorous development of childcare organizations in the suburbs has liberated more than 200,000 mothers from tedious housework and made them a fresh force on the agricultural front. With the needs of large-scale production, childcare organizations in the suburbs have been further consolidated and improved. In the past month, more than 1,100 children's canteens have been established in the suburbs. Generally, there are vegetables for every meal, three meals a day, and the variety is often changed. Full-time nurseries and kindergartens have also begun to appear in the suburbs, generally with clean and simple bedrooms and recreation rooms, and some also have sports fields and bathhouses. These facilities are mostly built by commune members who volunteer to work. Nurseries and kindergartens generally have established hygiene systems, and children's towels, water bowls, and tableware are used separately, and they are often cut their nails and wash their hair.

In the great development of childcare organizations, the ranks of childcare workers in the suburbs are also growing. Now there are more than 10,000 young women with a certain degree of political awareness and cultural level who are engaged in childcare work.

    娃娃身心健康　妈妈安心生产
    青海湖南山西北京普遍建立托儿组织
    据青海日报消息　截至目前，青海全省已有托儿组织九千八百多个，受托儿童占应托儿童的85％以上。这对解决当前生产大跃进中劳力不足和加强幼儿教育有着重大作用。
    青海各地党委都重视对托儿组织的领导。中共湟源县委专门抽调一位县委书记，负责群众福利工作；并且再三强调对保育员的选择。海北刚察县哈尔盖人民公社党委第一书记邹应成为了办好托儿所，曾连续召开了六次以上的党委会议，对保育员的条件曾进行过多次研究。黄南藏族自治州委第一书记宋林在州委扩大会议和赴所属各县工作时，对托儿工作的重要意义都作过宣传，并强调把优秀的党员、团员调到托儿所去工作。对一些乡社干部存在的“贫苦农牧民不会带娃娃”的思想，曾发动群众进行了一场大辩论，使大家明确认识到贫苦农牧民生活有了保障，再不用操心吃饭、穿衣问题了，那么就一定会带好娃娃，从而使办托儿所的工作也贯彻了阶级路线。
    据新湖南报消息　湖南省广大农村已普遍办起托儿所和幼儿园。
    在巩固和健全保育工作的过程中，各地在党委和妇联的领导下，采取了很多措施。湘西土家族苗族自治州训练了四千四百多名保育员和托儿干部。湘阴县委将保育工作作为统一布置、检查和评比的内容。嘉禾县有的公社，由党、团分支书、妇女主任、家长代表、教养员成立了幼儿管理委员会，并制定了章程，对教养员和家长分别提出了具体要求。受托的儿童在教养员耐心教养下，热爱集体生活，新的道德品质逐渐成长，受到家长的欢迎。
    依靠群众勤俭办所办园，是进一步巩固保育工作的重要关键之一。不少幼儿园、托儿所大都是利用庙宇祠堂或破旧房屋办起的，一切设备因陋就简。湘阴县洞厅围公社第一大队幼儿园的老师自己拣来许多旧木头给小朋友当积木，搬运沙子给小朋友游戏。
    据山西日报消息　山西全省托儿组织以飞快速度向前发展。目前，全省已经建立了十六万多所幼儿园和托儿所，七岁以下的幼儿受托总数占幼儿总数的90％以上，从而使全省三百三十多万妇女从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，勇猛地投入到各个生产战线中去。
    在带好孩子、做好托儿工作同样光荣的口号下，各地保育工作已经做出了显著的成绩。襄沁县虎亭乡对幼儿吃食方面，经常注意检查食物是否稀、软、新鲜、可口；在住宿和用具上，经常督促管理人员搞好清洁卫生。平顺县超英人民公社成立了幼托组织以来，党支部把保育工作列为经常工作中的一项议程。定期召集保育员进行检查、总结、交流工作经验，指导保育人员不断地改进工作方法，并且通过评比，表扬先进，大大地鼓励了保教人员的革命干劲，她们根据儿童心理特点，摸索出一套新的工作方法。因此，受托幼儿个个天真活泼，爱劳动，并且很有礼貌。
    为了彻底解放妇女劳力，目前有不少地区正对托儿组织进行整顿，总结经验和评比先进保育工作者。
    据新华社讯　首都郊区基本实现了幼儿教养集体化。据统计，全郊区已经建立二万七千八百多个托儿组织，共收托孩子三十八万七千多人，占学龄前儿童的83％。
    郊区托儿组织的蓬勃发展，使二十多万个妈妈从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，成为农业战线上的生力军。随着大生产的需要，郊区托儿组织又有了进一步的巩固和提高。近一个月来，郊区已经建立了一千一百多处幼儿食堂。一般的每日三餐，顿顿有蔬菜，而且常变花样。全托的托儿所、幼儿园也开始在郊区出现，一般都有整洁朴素的卧室和游艺室，有的还有运动场和澡堂。这些设备大都是社员们义务出工兴建的。托儿所、幼儿园一般都建立了卫生制度，儿童们的毛巾、水碗、餐具都分开用，还经常剪指甲、洗头发。
    在托儿组织大发展中，郊区保育人员的队伍也正在壮大，现在已有一万多个具有一定政治觉悟和文化水平的女青年担任保育工作。
