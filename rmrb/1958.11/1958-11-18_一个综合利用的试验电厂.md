    A Comprehensive Utilization Experimental Power Plant
    National Economic Commission, Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power
          A Satellite

    Following the intentions and commission of the National Economic Commission and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and under the leadership of the school's Party Committee and with the support of fifteen brother units such as the Beijing Repair and Manufacturing Plant of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, the faculty and students of Tsinghua University worked hard for two months to build a comprehensive utilization indigenous power plant with a capacity of 2,000 kilowatts in the north of Tsinghua Garden, launching the first indigenous "satellite" of the power industry.

    This power plant, due to its implementation of the principles of comprehensive utilization, replacing foreign with indigenous methods, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials, has created miracles in terms of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and has made many unprecedented innovations.

    The birth of this power plant has opened up a new path for prefectures, counties, and people's communes to run power plants by the whole people.

          Seven Characteristics

    This comprehensively utilized indigenous power plant has seven characteristics: more products, faster construction, less investment, material saving, simple equipment, less land occupation, and low cost.

    More products: This power plant not only produces electricity, but also produces a variety of products. Before the coal is sent to the boiler for combustion, it is first subjected to dry distillation to extract the volatiles (oil content), which becomes coal tar. The remaining semi-coke is then sent to the boiler as fuel for power generation. After treatment, the coal tar is made into gasoline, diesel, phenols, fertilizers, oil coke, etc. During dry distillation, various petroleum products and chemical products also produce a large amount of gas that can be utilized.

    The ash residue after the boiler combustion is not discarded either. It is mixed with lime and gypsum, ground, and becomes slag cement. Another indigenous kiln is set up to load clay bricks mixed with lime, gypsum, etc., and heated and burned using gas or flue gas from the boiler chimney, and ground to obtain clay cement. The warm water discharged from the power plant is also used to irrigate nearby paddy fields, which can promote crop production and replace irrigation pumping stations.

    The comprehensive power plant has a direct promoting effect on the development of rural industry and agriculture, which can be summarized as promoting "six-izations": electrification, mechanization, chemicalization, gasification, urbanization of rural construction, and water conservancy irrigation. In addition to the 12 million kilowatt-hours of electricity produced annually by the power plant, which can be directly supplied to the power needs of rural industry and agriculture, the gasoline produced by the power plant each year can be used for 47 cars or 94 tractors for one year; gas can be used as fuel for 20,000 people; cement can be used to build 32,000 square meters of two-story buildings or for industrial and water conservancy projects; fertilizer can be directly used for fertilizing fields; circulating water can be used to irrigate paddy fields; phenol can be used to make explosives, organic dyes, plastics, and agricultural agents; oil coke can be used to make artificial graphite and electrodes, as well as waterproof building materials, etc.

    Faster construction: The construction of this comprehensive utilization power plant began on July 16 this year, the design began on July 20, ground was broken on July 24, was completed on September 28, and formally generated electricity on October 10. It took a total of 86 days. This construction speed is much faster than the recently designed and built Yantai Power Plant in Shandong, or the recent standard design, and faster than the power plants built in the past. The comparison is as follows: (attached table)

    The construction time is only one-sixth of that of Yantai, and one-half of the recent standard design. In fact, the time saved is even more, because Yantai is a standard design and has long been included in the national plan, while the Tsinghua Power Plant is a creative design that consumes a lot of testing time. At the same time, it is a temporarily launched project. Except for the main equipment being settled, the building materials and auxiliary equipment were all temporarily grabbed. The construction period also happened to be a time of very tight materials and equipment, which also delayed some time. The actual construction time was less than two months. It is estimated that the construction of such a power plant can be completed in about one month in the future.

    Less investment: The total investment is 640,000 yuan, of which the power generation part is 590,000 yuan. The unit cost per kilowatt capacity is less than 300 yuan, which is only one-fifth of that of Yantai, and one-half of the recent standard design and Qinghe Power Plant.

    Material saving: Because this power plant was built using indigenous methods, the total consumption of steel is less than two tons, and the amount of steel used per kilowatt is only one-seventeenth of that of Yantai, and one-seventh of that of Qinghe. The amount of cement and wood is only one-twentieth of that of Yantai.

    Simple equipment: The total weight of the equipment in the entire plant is 73 tons, and the equipment weight per kilowatt of power generation capacity is only one-quarter of that of Yantai. For example, Yantai used 41 motors in the entire plant, while the Tsinghua Power Plant only used seven.

    Less land occupation: The comprehensive power plant occupies a total of seven mu, of which the power plant occupies about three mu, which is only one-fifteenth of that of Yantai, and one-half of the recent standard design.

    Low cost: The cost per kilowatt-hour is about three cents, which is about half lower than the cost of similar power plants without comprehensive utilization.

    In addition, it also has the advantages of easy operation and easy training of all-rounders.

    The above seven characteristics constitute a typical example of more, faster, better, and more economical.

            Several Measures

    Through breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, and boldly adopting many technological innovation measures in design and construction, the main ones include the following:

    1. This power plant utilizes existing buildings, and many equipment are arranged outdoors or semi-outdoors. This is the first open-air power plant in China. The equipment arranged outdoors includes: an open-air boiler, with only a roof to prevent rain and snow; condensing equipment, high-voltage power distribution equipment, water treatment equipment, blowers, and circulating water pumps are also placed outdoors.

    2. Greatly simplify the production system and save a lot of equipment. For example, the boiler does not use economizers or induced draft fans; the steam turbine does not use deaerators and high and low pressure heaters; the electrical system eliminates DC battery packs, etc. A lot of simplification has also been made to the thermal engineering system, plant power system, underground pipeline system, and coal conveying system. Although many equipment are saved, safe power generation is still guaranteed.

    3. Widely use indigenous methods and substitutes. In equipment and materials, wood, bamboo poles, and existing large trees are used to replace utility poles; iron wire replaces copper wire; earthenware pipes replace steel pipes; red bricks replace fire bricks; brick columns replace boiler steel frames; brick foundations replace the steel-reinforced concrete foundations used for steam turbines. More prominently, electrical equipment is indigenized, and nine innovations are created: indigenous oil switches, indigenous fuses, indigenous lightning arresters, indigenous isolating switches, indigenous relays, indigenous insulators, indigenous capacitors, and indigenous mutual inductors. What is especially amazing is the use of water tanks and wooden boards to make indigenous oil switches, conquering the high-voltage oil switches, which are known as the "mysterious mansion of electricity." These indigenous equipment are not only reliable in performance and can be made locally, but also simple to manufacture, and the cost is only one-twentieth to one-fiftieth of that of foreign ones. Many of the above indigenous methods and indigenous equipment are innovations.

    4. Fast construction and installation. Indigenous methods are used to lift and install equipment during construction, without the use of cranes. Indigenous methods of integral assembly experience are also created. The steam turbine and boiler furnace tubes are pre-assembled as a whole, and then pushed into the foundation as a whole, which is faster and more convenient than the traditionally used method of partial hoisting. In addition, new rapid construction methods have been created in the construction of high-temperature chimneys, deep well digging, and hydraulic engineering.

    These measures not only achieved "more, faster, better, and more economical," but also created experience. More importantly, they opened the door to ideological liberation for the mysterious views on running power plants.

        Extraordinary Labor

    When the construction work began, a fierce struggle between two paths was encountered. The Party leadership launched a debate, in which the idea of ​​DC boilers emerged, advocating that the power plant be as foreign as possible. The Party led this dispute between foreign and indigenous, and the essence of the dispute was who the indigenous power plant served. Through the debate, the soul of the construction of the plant was clarified - indigenous. The students wrote a poem "The Indigenous is Smiling" to praise the indigenous power plant: "Indigenous methods, indigenous materials, indigenous machines, indigenous methods of making, indigenous power plants using indigenous temples, the light of the indigenous power plant shines in all directions, commune members laugh heartily when they see it." After the debate, a large number of indigenous initiatives emerged, setting off a mass movement to advance towards "indigenous." In just ten days from the start of the design, hundreds of creative suggestions emerged. They said: "It has never existed in the world, it has never been written in books, the teacher has never talked about it, what are you afraid of! If you do it, it will exist in the world! It will be written in books! The teacher will talk about it!" This fully expresses the revolutionary spirit of the masses after gaining ideological liberation. However, people who are conservative in their thinking do not give in, and put forward various difficulties in the specific design. Creative indigenous designs such as outdoor boiler arrangement, brick foundations, brick column supports, and red brick furnace walls were strongly opposed. Even at the end, those who doubted still insisted on retaining their opinions, and asked the students who designed the indigenous to indicate that "this is experimental." It so happened that due to design errors and poor construction quality, the brick column was crushed by the steam drum. This accidental event caused widespread suspicion and confusion among the masses about "indigenization." Some people who adopted a reserved attitude in their thinking satirized and sarcastically said: "You have to be honest this time." The designers felt gray and prepared to make a review. The Party organization led the masses in a timely manner to attack the ideology of suspicion and conservatism, criticized the mood of grayness and preparation for review, found the cause of the brick seat collapse, and also promptly reminded everyone to pay attention to scientific basis while boldly innovating. Therefore, they worked hard for three days and three nights, and conducted "three reviews and five checks" on the overall design, determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "everything through experimentation," and regained confidence, finally achieving one success after another. During the entire construction process of the plant, a total of 613 various tests were conducted on indigenous reform measures, and reliable scientific basis were obtained. The entire completion of the indigenous power plant can be said to be an extraordinary struggle, with both experience and lessons.

    Although a few people held a resistant attitude, and some students regarded labor as a burden and were a little gloomy, most people were full of enthusiasm and high spirits. For two months, this power plant construction site has been boiling, regardless of day or night, regardless of wind or rain, with passionate enthusiasm. However, difficulties are still like stubborn enemies. When digging wells, quicksand was encountered, and it more than once sent the labor and hard work of many people for several days and nights to naught. However, how can stubborn enemies be an enemy to strong communist fighters! In two deep absorption wells, quicksand poured in continuously. People used specially made iron dustpans to put down to dig sand, and a dozen people pulled on it with sweat all over their faces. The efficiency was still very low, so they took off their clothes and went down to the bottom of the well to shovel sand, with half of their bodies immersed in the icy underground water, so cold that their lips turned purple. They came up to drink a few sips of shochu and went back down the well... Basket after basket of quicksand was constantly pulled up, and finally defeated this stubborn enemy - quicksand. In this way, the builders of the indigenous power plant fought tenaciously for two months. The completion of this power plant has merged much labor and sweat.

    Although the builders used labor and wisdom to create indigenous methods and indigenous equipment, indigenous methods still require indigenous materials, and at that time, materials were very tight in the market. In order to overcome the difficulties of materials, they had traveled all over Beijing and several nearby large cities. Although they tried to find ways everywhere, they often still could not buy materials. Once, there were many flange pipes missing for the steam turbine installation, but they could not be bought in the market. The masses proposed the initiative to inspect waste materials, and immediately formed a mass movement. In one night, a large number of broken pipes were found. They immediately took the initiative to process them themselves, not only meeting the needs of the steam turbine, but also supporting the boiler.

    The "satellite" of the comprehensive utilization indigenous power plant has been successfully launched. This is an innovation in power industry construction. We eagerly look forward to launching higher and higher "satellites" (especially the indigenization of power generation equipment) after this first "indigenous satellite," and to promote indigenous power plants as universally as indigenous blast furnaces, to bring about a comprehensive blossoming.

    一个综合利用的试验电厂
    国家经委水利电力局
          一颗卫星
    清华大学师生按照国家经委和北京市委的意图和委托，在学校党委领导和水利电力部北京修造厂等十五个兄弟单位的支援下，奋战两个月，在清华园北面建成一座容量为二千瓩综合利用土电厂，放出了电力工业的第一颗土“卫星”。
    这个电厂由于贯彻了综合利用、以土代洋、因地制宜，就地取材的方针，因而在“多、快、好、省”方面创造了奇迹，并作出了许多前所未有的创举。
    这个电厂的诞生，为专区、县和人民公社等全民办电开辟了一条新的道路。
          七个特点
    这座综合利用的土电厂具有七个特点：产品多、建设快、投资少、材料省、设备简单、占地少、成本低。
    产品多：这个电厂不仅生产电力，还生产多种产品。煤在送入锅炉燃烧之前，先经过干馏，把其中的挥发分（油分）提炼出来，成为煤焦油，剩下的半焦再送入锅炉作发电燃料；煤焦油经过处理，制成汽油、柴油、酚、化肥、油焦等；各种石油产品和化工产品，干馏时，还生产出大量的煤气可以利用。
    锅炉燃烧后的灰渣也不白白抛掉，把它与石灰、石膏混合磨碎，就得到炉渣水泥；又另设一个土窑，把粘土坯与石灰、石膏等混合装入，利用煤气或锅炉烟囱中的烟气加热燃烧和磨碎，就得到粘土水泥；电厂排出的温水也利用来灌溉附近的稻田，可以促进农作物增产和代替灌溉抽水站。
    综合电厂对于农村工农业的发展有直接的促进作用，归纳起来可以促进“六化”：电气化，机械化，化学化，煤气化，农村建筑城市化，水利灌溉化。电厂除每年生产一千二百万度电力可以直接供给农村工农业发展动力需要外，电厂每年生产的汽油可供四十七辆汽车或九十四辆拖拉机一年之用；煤气可供两万人燃料之用；水泥可盖双层楼房三万二千平方公尺或供办工业和水利工程使用；化肥直接可以肥田；循环水可以灌溉稻田；酚可以制作炸药、有机染料、塑料及农业药剂；油焦可以制成人造石墨和电极，以及防水建筑材料等等。
    建设快：这个综合利用的电厂从今年7月16日开始筹建，7月20日开始设计，7月24日破土动工，9月28日建成，10月10日正式发电。前后共八十六天，这个建设速度无论比过去设计最近建成的山东烟台电厂，或最近的标准设计都快得多，比以往建成的电厂更快。比较如下：（附图表）
    建设时间仅为烟台的六分之一，为最近标准设计的二分之一，实际上缩短的时间还多，因烟台是标准设计，而且早已列入国家计划，而清华电厂是一种创造性的设计，消耗许多试验时间，同时又是个临时上马的项目，除主要设备有着落外，建筑材料和附属设备都是临时抓的，建厂期间又正好是材料设备非常紧张的时候，也耽误了一些时间，实际建厂时间不到两个月。估计今后再建这样的电厂有一个月左右时间即可完成。
    投资少：全部投资为六十四万元，其中发电部分为五十九万元，每瓩容量的单位造价小于三百元，仅为烟台的五分之一，为最近标准设计及清河电厂的二分之一。
    材料省：这个电厂因为用土办法建成的，全部耗用钢材不到二吨，每瓩钢材用量仅为烟台的十七分之一，为清河的七分之一，水泥和木材均为烟台的二十分之一。
    设备简单：全厂设备总重七十三吨，每瓩发电能力设备重量仅为烟台的四分之一，例如全厂电动机烟台用四十一台，清华电厂只用七台。
    占地少：综合电厂全部占地七亩，其中电厂占地约三亩，仅为烟台的十五分之一，为最近标准设计的二分之一。
    成本低：每度电约合三分，比同类型没有综合利用的电厂成本要低一半左右。
    此外还具有操作简便，容易培养多面手等优点。
    以上七个特点构成了多快好省的一个典型。
            几项措施
    通过破除迷信，思想解放，在设计和施工中大胆地采取了很多技术革新的措施，其中主要的有下列几项：
    1、这个电厂是利用旧有房屋，许多设备采取露天或半露天布置，这在国内是首创的露天电厂。布置在露天的设备有：露天锅炉，上面只搭个顶棚，以防雨雪。凝汽设备，高压配电设备，水处理设备，鼓风机和循环水泵等也都是放在露天的。
    2、大大简化生产系统，省掉大量设备。例如在锅炉上没有用省煤器，引风机；汽机上没有用除氧器和高低压加热器；电气上省去了直流蓄电池组等等。并对热工系统，厂用电系统，地下管道系统，输煤系统等也作了大量的简化。虽然省掉许多设备，但同样保证安全发电。
    3、广泛地采用土办法和代用品。在设备器材上用木材、竹竿和原有的大树代替电杆；铁线代替铜线；缸瓦管代替钢管；红砖代替耐火砖；砖柱代替锅炉钢架；砖砌基础代替汽轮机沿用的钢筋混凝土基础；更突出的是土化了电器设备，创造了土油开关、土熔绝器、土避雷器、土隔离开关、土继电器、土绝缘子、土电容器、土互感器等九项革新；尤其使人感到新奇的是用水缸、木板制成土油开关，攻下了号称“电气神秘之府”的高压油开关。这些土设备不仅性能可靠，可以就地取材，制作简单，成本仅及洋的二十分之一到五十分之一。上述土办法，土设备很多都是创举。
    4、快速施工和安装。施工用土法起吊和安装设备，没用起重机。并创造了土法整体组装经验，把汽轮机和锅炉炉管预先组装好，然后整体推入基础，比沿用的分部吊装法又快又方便。此外在修建高温烟囱，打深井和水工建筑等方面都创造了新的快速施工方法。
    这些措施不仅取得了“多快好省”，而且创造了经验，更重要的是给办电厂存在的神秘观点打开了思想解放的大门。
        不平凡的劳动
    当建厂工作一开始，就遇到了两条道路的激烈斗争，党领导展开了辩论，辩论中出现了主张直流锅炉的思想，主张电厂搞的愈洋愈好，党领导着这场洋土之争，争论的实质是土电厂为谁服务，通过争论明确了建厂的灵魂——土，同学们做了一首“土在笑”的诗来歌颂土电厂：“土的办法土的料，土的机器土法造，土的电厂用土庙，土电厂光芒四方照，公社社员见了哈哈笑”。争论之后，出现了大量土化倡议，掀起了群众性的向“土”进军，仅仅设计开始的十天内就出现了数百条创造性的建议，他们说：“世界上不曾有过，书本上不曾写过，先生不曾讲过，怕什么！把它干出来，世界上不是就得有了吗！书本上不是就得写了吗！先生不就得讲了吗！”这充分表达了群众获得思想解放后的革命气概。但是思想上保守的人并不就此服输，在具体设计中提出种种质难。锅炉露天布置，砖砌基础，砖柱支架，红砖炉墙等创造性的土化设计就遭到激烈的反对，一直到最后，怀疑的人仍然坚持保留意见，要求土化设计的同学注明“这是试验性”的。事情正好不凑巧，由于设计有错误，施工质量不高，砖柱被汽包压塌了下来，这件偶然的事件引起了群众对“土化”普遍发生了怀疑和混乱，一部分思想上采取保留态度的人就讽言冷语说：“你们这回可得要老实些了。”设计的人出现了灰溜溜准备检讨的心情。党组织及时领导群众打击了怀疑保守思想，批判了灰溜溜准备检讨的心情，找出了砖座压塌的原因，同时也及时提醒大家在大胆革新的同时要注意科学根据，于是苦战三天三夜，对全面设计进行了“三审五查”，决心遵照毛主席“一切经过试验”的指示，重新鼓起信心，终于获得一个接一个的成功，在整个建厂过程中对土化革新措施共作了六百一十三次各种试验，获得了可靠的科学依据。整个土电厂的建成可以说是一场不平常的斗争，有经验也有教训。
    虽然少数人抱着抵触的态度，部分学生也有把劳动当负担，有点愁眉苦脸，但大多数的人是干劲冲天，意气风发，两个月来这个电厂工地一直是沸腾的，不分昼与夜，不问风和雨，热情奔放，然而困难仍是像顽固的敌人一样，挖井遇到了流沙，它不止一次地把多少人几昼夜的劳动和辛苦一付东流，然而顽强的敌人又怎能敌得过坚强的共产主义战士！有两个人深的吸收井里，流沙源源涌来，人们用特别制的铁簸箕放下去挖沙，十几个人在上面拉得满头大汗，效率仍然很低，于是他们脱了衣服，就下到井底铲沙，半个身子浸在冰凉的地下水中，冷得嘴唇发紫，他们上来喝几口烧酒，又重新下井……一篮接一篮的流沙不断的被拉上来，终于战胜了这顽强的敌人——流沙，就这样，土电厂的建设者们意志坚强地战斗了两个月，这个电厂的建成融汇了多少劳动和汗水。
    虽然建设者用劳动和智慧创造了土办法、土设备，但是土办法也还要土材料，而当时市上材料非常紧张，为了克服材料困难，他们曾跑遍了北京市和附近几个大城市，虽然这样到处想办法，但常常还是买不到材料，有一次汽机安装缺很多法兰管子，但是市上买不到，群众就提出了检废料的倡议，马上形成一个群众运动，一夜间找来了大批破旧管子，他们立即自行动手加工，不但满足了汽机的需要，还支援了锅炉。
    综合利用土电厂的“卫星”发射成功了，这是电力工业建设上的一项创举，我们热烈盼望在这第一颗“土卫星”之后，接着一颗又一颗地放出更高的“卫星”来（特别是发电设备的土化），把土电厂像土高炉一样普遍推广，来它一个全面开花。（附图片）
