In the Ranks of the Youth Shock Brigade
--Sketches of the Life of Young Activists
　　Our Correspondent
    Voluntary Train Attendants
    Recently, one evening, as the Beijing-Guangzhou 8th Express Train pulled out of Guangzhou Station, a young, military-clad voluntary train attendant appeared in each carriage.

    These voluntary train attendants were representatives from the Guangzhou-stationed troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, attending the National Congress of Youth Activists. They divided into three shifts, working around the clock to assist the train attendants in each carriage, as the first gift to the National Congress of Youth Activists. Under the slogan of "Attentive Service, Ensuring Safety," they worked enthusiastically. Some scrubbed floors and windows, some emptied spittoons and tidied bedding, as earnestly as soldiers carrying out orders from superiors. Lieutenant Xia Yumin scrubbed the carriage floor twice in one hour and constantly brought tea to the passengers. Every time the train stopped at a station, they stood at the carriage doors, assisting the elderly and young, warmly helping passengers on and off the train.

    When the train arrived in Wuhan, it was a bit cold. Lieutenant Han Yongyin, on the night shift, went to each carriage to see if the passengers were well-covered. When he saw an elderly passenger sleeping hunched over in his seat, thinly dressed, he quietly took off his overcoat and covered the passenger with it. When the passenger woke up from his sleep, he was so moved that he took Han Yongyin's hand and said, "Comrades, you are truly the best people!"

    The dining car began service, and the seats were full, with more people constantly arriving to eat. The attendants were overwhelmed, and these voluntary train attendants immediately came to support them. Huang Guodong and Liu Yueguo were the first to join the ranks of the attendants, serving dishes, serving rice, setting out chopsticks, and wiping tables for the customers. Although they were also hungry, they forgot about themselves for the sake of the passengers.

    Their actions deeply moved every passenger.

    Guests Who Refuse to be Served
    Recently, thousands of young activists from all over the country, who refuse to be served, have been staying in many hotels in the capital. Every morning after getting up, they collectively do exercises, sing songs, and compete to do everything themselves. Disregarding the waiters' objections, they fetch water, bring dishes, and take rice themselves, snatching brooms and wiping cloths from the waiters' hands, vying to clean the interior and exterior. The young guests at the Baiguang Road Hotel also cleaned nearby streets and toilets in groups. To save electricity in the capital, the young guests at the Qianmen Hotel generally did not take the elevator when going up and down stairs, despite the repeated beckoning of the waiters standing by the elevator, they said: No need! Many hotel waiters were deeply moved by such guests and wrote many big-character posters to praise them.

    Iron Smelting at the Hotel
    In the courtyard of the Beiwei Hotel, where the representatives of the Henan Province youth activists were staying, there was a small earthen furnace, just over a foot high. The equipment was very simple. It was less than a foot in diameter, with a small wooden bellows connected to one opening on the left, and an opening on the right for ventilation and iron tapping. However, on the 17th, this small furnace smelted nearly two pounds of iron.

    This small furnace, from its appearance, really looked like it was playfully built by a child. Who on earth did this at the hotel? It turned out that there was a twelve-year-old little brother in the Henan Province Youth Activist Delegation. His name is Zheng Zhangcheng. He built this furnace, and he also smelted the iron.

    Speaking of Zheng Zhangcheng, almost everyone in Luoyang Prefecture and Yechuan County, Henan Province, near and far, knows him. It was he who created this small furnace called the "lampshade type," which had been promoted to more than 19,000 in Yechuan County. This kind of furnace does not use coal or coke, only firewood, even tree branches are also acceptable. After the ore is added, it can smelt more than one to two pounds of iron in less than twenty minutes with a blow of the small bellows. In October, Yechuan County smelted 112,000 tons of iron, and more than 15,000 tons were smelted using this small furnace.

    Zheng Zhangcheng came to Beijing for the meeting this time and brought more than ten kilograms of iron ore, more than ten kilograms of firewood, a small wooden bellows and a small wooden stick for both poking fire and digging out iron, all of which were all his iron-smelting furniture. On the 17th, he found a few bricks in the courtyard, mixed some thin mud, and built a small furnace in one hour starting at 11:00 in the morning. He started smelting iron at 1:00 in the afternoon. It took fifty minutes to fire the furnace, and after adding the ingredients, it only took twenty minutes for the molten iron to flow out.

    Sending Seeds to Tibet Early
    As soon as Tan Changrong, a young activist from Tibet, arrived in the mainland, he busied himself collecting high-yielding crop seeds and yield-increasing experiences from various places during his visits. He carefully packaged wheat seeds from the Luoyang People's Commune and cotton seeds from Shandong in the hotel, preparing to send them to Tibet soon. Recently, he has written to Tibet about the experience of pig breeding in various places and the soaring enthusiasm of the commune members of the People's Commune. These days, he has seen various situations of the Great Leap Forward in the mainland, which has caused countless excitements, and he thinks of the construction of Tibet. Although his experiment of planting pasture once a year and then planting highland barley in Tibet has been successful this year (only one crop can be planted in Tibet in the past year), he is not satisfied with this result and is determined to experiment with producing 10,000 catties of highland barley and wheat per mu next year.

    在青年突击手的队伍里
    ——青年积极分子生活花絮
  　本报记者
    义务列车员
    最近有一个晚上，当京广第八次特快列车开出广州车站时，每一个车厢里都出现了一个穿着军装的年轻的义务列车员。
    这些义务列车员，是中国人民解放军驻广州部队出席全国青年积极分子大会的代表。他们分成三班日夜不停地协助每个车厢的列车员进行工作，以做为献给全国青年积极分子大会的第一件礼物。在
  “服务周到，确保安全”的口号下，他们热情地劳动，有的擦地板、擦门窗，有的倒痰盂、整理卧具，就像战士执行上级命令那样认真。夏裕民少尉在一个小时内就把车厢的地板擦了两遍，并且不断地为旅客们送茶。每当列车停站时，他们都站到车厢门口，扶老携幼，热情地照顾旅客们上、下车。
    列车到武汉时，天有些冷了，值夜班的韩永银少尉就到各个车厢去，看看旅客们有没有盖好被子。当他看到有一位上了年纪的旅客，伏在座位上睡着了，身上穿的很单薄，就悄悄地把自己身上的大衣脱下来，盖在这位旅客身上。当这位旅客从熟睡中醒来时，感动得拉着韩永银的手说：“同志，你们真是最优秀的人！”
    餐车开始营业了，席位上坐得满满的，就餐的人还在不断增加。招待员忙不过来，这些义务列车员又立即赶来支援。黄国栋、刘跃国首先加入了招待员的行列，给顾客们端菜、端饭、摆筷子、抹桌子。虽然他们也饿着肚子，但是，为了旅客，他们忘掉了自己。
    他们的行动深深感动了每一个旅客。
    不接受招待的客人
    最近，首都许多旅馆里，住着成千名不接受招待的来自祖国各地的青年积极分子，他们每天早上起床后，集体练操、唱歌，什么事情都是争着自己干。不顾服务员的阻拦，自己打开水，端菜拿饭，从服务员手里夺过扫帚、擦桌布，抢着整理室内外卫生。白光路一个旅馆的青年客人们还成群地打扫附近街道和厕所。前门饭店的青年客人们为了节约首都用电，在上下楼时普遍不坐电梯，守在电梯旁边的服务员再三招手，但他们说：用不着！许多旅馆的服务员看到这样的客人深受感动，写了许多张大字报来表扬他们。
    旅馆炼铁
    在河南省青年积极分子代表们住的北纬旅馆的院子里，有一个一尺多高的小土炉，设备非常简单，直径不到一尺，左边的一个口通着一只小小的木制风箱，右边一个口是用来通风和出铁的。就是这样一个小炉子，17日那天，却炼出了将近二斤铁。
    这个小炉子从外表看来，真像是一个顽皮的孩子垒起来闹着玩的，这到底是谁在旅馆里干的事呢？原来河南省青年积极分子代表团里有一个十二岁的小弟弟，他的名字叫做郑章成，这个炉子就是他砌的，铁也是他炼出来的。
    提起郑章成，差不多河南省洛阳专区和乐川县的人，远远近近的都知道他。就是他创造的这种被叫做“灯罩型”的小炉子，曾经在乐川县推广到一万九千多个。这种炉子不用煤，不用焦，只烧木柴，甚至树枝也可以，矿石加进去以后，用小风箱一吹，不到二十分钟，就可以炼出一斤多到二斤铁来。10月份，乐川县全县炼出了十一万二千吨铁，光是用这种小炉子炼出来的就有一万五千多吨。
    郑章成这次到北京来开会，特地从家里带来了十几斤铁矿石，十几斤木柴，还带了一个木制小风箱和一根又拨火又掏铁的小木棍，所有这些，就是他炼铁的全部家具。17日那天，他在院子里找了几块砖头，和了一点稀泥，从上午十一点开始，一个钟头之内就砌成了一个小炉子，下午一点开始炼铁，烧炉用了五十分钟，加料以后，只花了二十分钟的功夫，铁水就流了出来。
    把种籽早点寄到西藏去
    西藏的青年积极分子谭昌荣一到内地，就忙着在参观的时候收集各地高额丰产的农作物种籽和增产经验，他在旅馆里细心地包扎洛阳人民公社的小麦种和山东的棉种，准备很快地寄到西藏去。最近，他已把各地生猪繁殖的经验和人民公社社员的冲天干劲写信寄回西藏了。这些天来，他看到内地大跃进的各种情况，引起无数次激动，就想到西藏的建设。虽然，他今年试验在西藏一年中种一次牧草再种一次青稞已经成功（西藏过去一年内只能种一季作物），但他并不满足这个成绩，决心要在明年试验每亩青稞、小麦产一万斤。（附图片）
