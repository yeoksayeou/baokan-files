    Learning from Chairman Mao's Scientific Work Style of Integrating Theory with Practice
    Li Da
    With such a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, we philosophy workers should also make a great leap forward. The first step in this great leap forward is to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works and change the past study style, teaching style, and writing style of separating theory from practice, and establish a study style, teaching style, and writing style of integrating theory with practice.
    Since 1950, more and more people in our country have been studying Marxist-Leninist philosophy, and the ranks of philosophy workers have gradually expanded. In research and teaching, and in publicizing dialectical materialism and criticizing bourgeois idealism, much achievement has been made. This is certain. However, there are still many shortcomings. It is no exaggeration to say that many of our comrades have only studied philosophy according to the system of philosophical works written by Stalin, and when it comes to linking with practice, they only link with some of the practices written in the books, and very little with the actualities of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Such a dogmatic study style is bound to produce a dogmatic teaching style. Some comrades, when lecturing, write out outlines item by item in advance, take them to the classroom and read them verbatim, while the students copy the notes. Some comrades, when writing articles, mostly dwell on terminology and concepts, the meaning is obscure, the content is empty, and they carry some of the baggage of formalism. Such dogmatic study styles, teaching styles, and writing styles did indeed exist in the past. Now everyone unanimously expresses that they want to study Chairman Mao's works. I think that when we study Chairman Mao's works, especially his philosophical works, we should not only learn the scientific theories in those works, but also learn Chairman Mao's scientific method of linking theory with practice. Chairman Mao is a great master of materialist dialectics. Each of his works is a model of using materialist dialectics to analyze historical realities and revolutionary realities and solve major problems in the Chinese revolution and construction. Therefore, after each of his works is published, it has the effect of mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and transforming society, making the social face of our country constantly renewed. This is truly "Once theory is grasped by the masses, it immediately becomes a material force." Why can Chairman Mao's works be grasped by the masses? That is because the theories expounded in his works correctly reflect the developing objective reality and concentrate the opinions and demands of millions of masses. Chairman Mao, in response to different objective realities in different periods, used the method of cognition of "from the masses, to the masses" and the method of class analysis to formulate different strategies and methods, which promoted the realization of the democratic revolution and prepared the conditions for the socialist revolution. We should learn from Chairman Mao's example of applying Marxism-Leninism, applying dialectics and materialism in practical work at all times, learn from his example of combining a serious spirit of principle with a lively spirit of originality, and learn from his example of being with millions of masses, concentrating the wisdom of the masses, and leading the masses with correct theory.
    Marxist philosophy is the scientific abstraction of the experience of the working people, especially the proletariat's struggle for production and class struggle, over thousands of years. Therefore, we philosophy workers should do the work of linking theory with practice, so that this philosophy is linked with the current specific struggle for production and class struggle, and return this philosophy from the working people to the working people. Now workers and peasants who study philosophy have this reflection: they cannot understand the articles written by philosophy experts, but they can easily understand Chairman Mao's philosophical works; they cannot understand the philosophy lectured by experts, but they can understand the philosophy lectured by their own comrades. That is to say, articles that link theory with practice can be understood, otherwise they cannot be understood; lectures that link theory with practice can be understood, otherwise they cannot be understood. This is a great inspiration for us who are engaged in philosophical work. If we want to do a good job in philosophy, we must walk out of the study, go to the countryside and factories, go deep into the working masses, become one with them, participate in the struggle for production and class struggle, and be familiar with various problems in production and various problems in mass work. Only by first being a student of the masses can we be a teacher of the masses. This sentence is completely applicable to us philosophy workers.

    学习毛主席理论联系实际的科学作风
    李达
    工农业生产这样的大跃进，我们哲学工作者也应该来一个大跃进。这个大跃进的第一步，就是要认真学习毛主席的著作，改变过去理论脱离实际的学风、教风和文风，树立理论联系实际的学风、教风和文风。
    1950年以来，我国学习马克思列宁主义哲学的人越来越多了，哲学工作者的队伍逐步扩大了，在研究工作和教学工作方面，在宣传辩证唯物主义，批判资产阶级唯心主义方面，都作出了很多的成绩，这是肯定的；但也还有不少的缺点。不庸讳言，我们的许多同志，只是按照斯大林所写的哲学著作的体系学习哲学的，说到联系实际，也只是联系书本上所写的一些实际，对于我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实际，联系得很少很少。像这样的教条主义的学风，必然产生教条主义的教风。有些同志讲课的时候，预先一条一条地写出提纲，拿到教室照本宣读，学生则照抄笔记。有些同志写文章的时候多半是扣名词、扣概念、语义晦涩，内容空洞，带一些八股气。这样的教条主义的学风、教风和文风，在以前确实是存在的。现在大家都一致表示要学习毛主席的著作，我想，我们学习毛主席的著作，特别是学习他的哲学著作，不单是为了学习那些著作中的科学理论，并且要学习毛主席用理论联系实际的科学方法。毛主席是唯物辩证法的大匠，他的每一篇著作，都是运用唯物辩证法分析历史实际和革命实际，解决中国革命和建设中的重大问题的范例。所以他的每篇著作发表以后，就具有动员群众、组织群众和改造社会的作用，使我国的社会面貌不断更新。这真是“理论一掌握群众，就立刻成为物质的力量。”毛主席的著作为什么能够掌握群众呢？那就是因为他的著作中所阐述的理论，正确地反映了发展着的客观实际，集中了千百万群众的意见和要求。毛主席针对各个时期不同的客观实际，运用从群众中来到群众中去的认识方法和阶级分析方法，制定出不同的策略和方法，促进了民主革命的实现，并为社会主义革命准备了条件。我们应当学习毛主席在实际工作中时时刻刻应用马克思列宁主义、应用辩证法和唯物论的榜样，学习他把严肃的原则精神同生动的独创精神相结合的榜样，学习他同千百万群众在一起，集中群众智慧，以正确的理论领导群众的榜样。
    马克思主义的哲学是几千年来的劳动人民，特别是无产阶级生产斗争和阶级斗争的经验的科学抽象。因此，我们哲学工作者应该去做理论联系实际的工作，使这种哲学联系当前的具体的生产斗争和阶级斗争，把这种从劳动人民来的哲学归还给劳动人民。现在学习哲学的工人农民有这样的反映：他们读哲学专家写的文章读不懂，读毛主席的哲学著作却容易懂；他们听专家讲哲学听不懂，听他们自己的同志讲哲学就听得懂。这就是说，理论联系实际的文章就读得懂，否则就读不懂；理论联系实际的讲课就听得懂，否则就听不懂。这对于我们搞哲学工作的人，是一个很大的启发。我们要搞好哲学工作，必须走出书斋，下乡下厂，深入劳动群众中，同他们打成一片，参加生产斗争和阶级斗争，熟悉生产中的各种问题和群众工作中的各种问题。只有先当群众的学生，才能当群众的先生，这句话对我们哲学工作者完全适用。
