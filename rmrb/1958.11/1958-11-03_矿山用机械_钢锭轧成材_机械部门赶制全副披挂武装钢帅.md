Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: While providing a large number of steelmaking and ironmaking equipment, the national machinery industry is rushing to manufacture a batch of mining equipment and rolling equipment to strengthen the two ends of the steel industry: mining production and steel rolling production.

Mining production and steel rolling production are currently the weak links in the steel industry. The rapid development of the steel industry requires, on the one hand, enhancing mining production capacity to extract more smelting raw materials and fuel; on the other hand, it also requires equipment to roll the produced steel into steel products in a timely manner. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the machinery industry to provide a large number of mining equipment and rolling equipment. In order to mobilize the workers of the national machinery industry to complete this task, the First Ministry of Machine Building held a telephone conference of directors of industry departments and bureaus of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in mid-October to deploy this work. Recently, the ministry and its relevant departments have successively sent working groups to key areas to further inspect and organize this work.

At present, machinery factories in many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have taken tense action. According to preliminary arrangements in fifteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions alone, the crushing equipment manufactured in the next two months will be equivalent to about twice the total output from January to October of this year. Some places have also organized the repair departments of other enterprises to rush to manufacture mining and rolling equipment for the steel marshal. The repair shops and repair factories of the paper mill, handicraft cooperatives, and commercial departments in Andong City have undertaken the task of manufacturing crushing equipment, hoisting equipment, and rolling equipment.

Factories undertaking the manufacture of rolling equipment have placed the task of manufacturing rolling equipment in the first place, and they also smelt steel and iron themselves and manufacture large earth machine tools to overcome the difficulties of large equipment and insufficient raw materials, striving to overfulfill the manufacturing task of rolling equipment. The workers of Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant created the experience of "tea kettle cooking pig head", using a two-ton electric furnace to smelt more than seven tons of molten steel, overcoming the difficulty of not being able to cast large parts of rolling mills, and completing the manufacturing task of two rolling mills ahead of schedule. Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant manufactured six sets of rolling mills in October alone.

In the rush to manufacture mining equipment, especially crushing equipment, a mass movement has been formed. A batch of simple crushing equipment such as hand-operated crushers, horse-drawn crushers, and simplified foreign crushers have been manufactured by local machinery factories and handicraft cooperatives. A "bulldozer-type" crusher manufactured by the workers of Wuxi Internal Combustion Engine Plant can replace one hundred people's labor with only five people operating it. Some universities and colleges are also actively designing and manufacturing crushing equipment. The mining and beneficiation teaching and research group of Beijing Mining College has designed seven simple crushers for local selection and manufacture. The steel regiment of Licun Township, Yanshi County, Henan Province, has successfully manufactured a hanging bow flying hammer crusher, which is controlled by four people and can crush more than 20,000 jin of iron ore in sixteen hours, which is ten times more efficient than manual labor. Now they have basically achieved mechanization in crushing ore.

### 矿山用机械　钢锭轧成材  机械部门赶制全副披挂武装钢帅

    矿山用机械　钢锭轧成材
    机械部门赶制全副披挂武装钢帅
    新华社2日讯　全国机械工业在大量提供炼钢炼铁设备的同时，正在突击赶制一批矿山设备和轧钢设备，加强钢铁工业的两头——矿山生产和轧钢的生产。
    矿山生产和轧钢生产是目前钢铁工业的薄弱环节。钢铁工业的迅速发展，一方面要求增强矿山生产能力，开采更多的冶炼原料、燃料；另一方面也需要设备，把已生产出来的钢及时轧制成钢材。因此，迫切要求机械工业提供大批矿山设备和轧钢设备。为了动员全国机械工业职工完成这一任务，第一机械工业部已在10月中旬召开了省、市、自治区工业厅、局长电话会议，部署了这一工作。最近这个部和所属有关部门，又相继派出工作组到重点地区去，进一步检查和组织这一工作。
    目前，许多省、市、自治区的机械工厂，已经紧张地行动起来。仅据十五个省、市、自治区的初步安排，今后两个月制造的破碎设备，就相当于今年1月到10月总产量的两倍左右。有些地方把其他企业的机修部门也组织起来，为钢铁元帅赶制矿山和轧钢设备。安东市的造纸厂、手工业社、商业部门的机修车间和修理工厂，都承担起制造破碎设备、卷扬设备、轧钢设备的任务。
    承担制造轧钢设备的工厂，都把制造轧钢设备的任务排在第一位，并且自己动手炼钢炼铁、制造大型土机床，猛冲大型设备和原材料不足的难关，力争超额完成轧钢设备的制造任务。沈阳矿山机器厂职工创造了“茶壶煮猪头”的经验，用两吨电炉炼出七吨多钢水，战胜不能铸造轧钢机大部件的困难，提前完成两台轧钢机的制造任务。洛阳矿山机器厂在10月份一个月里就制造好六套轧钢机。
    在赶制矿山设备特别是破碎设备方面，更形成了群众性的运动。一批手摇破碎机、马拉破碎机、简化的洋破碎机等结构简单的破碎设备，已由各地机械工厂和手工业社制造出来。无锡内燃机厂职工制造的一种“斗牛式”破碎机，只要五个人操作，可以代替一百个人劳动。一些大专学校也在积极设计和制造破碎设备。北京矿业学院采矿选矿教研组，已经设计出七种简易的破碎机，供各地选择制造。河南偃师县李村乡钢铁团自己制造成功一种吊弓飞锤破碎机，由四个人掌握，十六小时能破碎两万多斤铁矿石，比手工劳动效率提高十倍，现在他们破碎矿石已经基本上做到机械化。
