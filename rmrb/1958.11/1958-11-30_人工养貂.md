    Artificial Sable Farming
    The main key to artificial sable farming lies in the sable's reproduction. Sables give birth in April and May, so this year in April, the people at the Jilin Special Products Research Institute's Sable Farm became tense.
    The entire farm has sixty sables, making it the largest artificial sable farm in the country. According to foreign literature, because sables are restless and delicate, and extremely sensitive to the external environment, they must be artificially raised for two years before they can breed. However, the sables here were only captured from Changbai Mountain half a year ago, and eight female sables are already facing their due date. The sable farmers are determined to break the superstition and ensure that the first generation of artificially raised sables survives early. Therefore, at the end of March, they began to clean the cages, disinfect them, lay soft and clean Ula grass to keep them warm, increase the nutrition for the female sables, and maintain a quiet environment. At the beginning of April, special personnel quietly entered the enclosure, tiptoed near the cages, listened carefully, three times a day.
    On the early morning of April 23, the first litter of baby sables made a faint call. Three hairless baby sables were trembling on the grass. But this startled the mother sable, and after checking on the third day, all three baby sables had been eaten by the mother sable. On April 30, two female sables gave birth at the same time, and the baby sables made a loud cry. People did not dare to check again, but after four days, another litter of baby sables was eaten by the mother sable. After that, five litters were born in a row, including a litter of three baby sables on May 9. To avoid being eaten by the mother sable, they were moved into mink cages for mixed rearing. Minks are gentle and have a strong maternal love, but the little sables were physically weak and unable to drink milk, and soon died. Finally, five baby sables from two litters with the loudest calls were preserved. Now, the average weight of the five young sables has exceeded the mother sable by 450-500 grams.
    A month later, people became nervous again: the sable mating season had arrived!
    The sables of Changbai Mountain mate from June to August every year, and give birth from April to May of the following year, which is extremely accurate. However, the sables in the farm showed no signs of estrus in June this year. Everyone followed the general rule of artificial insemination for livestock, using pregnant mare serum (blood from mares 40-100 days pregnant) to induce estrus, and experimenting with mixing plant-based sex hormones in the food. As a result, estrus began three days later. During this period, the breeders entered the observation platform from 2:00 a.m., recording the mating behavior of the sables. Sometimes, the cages were moved to nearby forests to promote sable mating in a suitable natural environment. Finally, three pairs of these sables, which had only been artificially raised for nine months, were successfully mated.
    The superstition that artificial sable farming cannot reproduce within two years has begun to be broken!

    人工养貂
    人工养貂的主要关键在于貂的繁殖。紫貂分娩是在4、5月间，因此今年4月，吉林特产研究所养貂场的人们紧张起来。
    全场有紫貂六十只，是目前全国最大的人工养貂场。据国外文献记载：由于紫貂性躁而娇，对外界环境极为敏感，人工驯养须两年以后才能繁殖。但这里的紫貂刚刚从长白山捕来半年，八只母貂已面临产期了。养貂工人们决心破除迷信，使即将诞生的第一代人工养貂早日成活。于是他们在3月末尾就开始打扫笼舍，进行消毒，铺好松软干净的乌拉草保持温暖，并对母貂增加养分，维护安静。一进4月，每天有专门人员悄悄地进入围栏，蹑近笼舍，细心静听，一天三次。
    4月23日清早，第一胎仔貂发出微弱的呼叫。三个光皮的仔貂在草上颤颤欲动。但从此惊动母貂，第三天三个仔貂再一检查，完全被母貂吃了。30日有两个母貂同时产仔，仔貂的叫声很大。人们不敢再去察看，但过了四天又有一窝仔貂被母貂吃掉，此后连续生了五窝，其中5月9日一窝三个仔貂，为避免被母貂吃掉，移入水貂笼舍混合饲养。水貂温存，母爱很强，只是小紫貂身体孱弱不能吃奶，不久也死掉了。最后有两窝叫声最大的五个仔貂终于保存下来。现在，五个幼貂的平均体重已超过母貂450—500克。
    一个月后，人们又紧张起来：紫貂配种的季节到了！
  长白山的紫貂，每年6至8月配种，次年4至5月分娩，极为准确。但场内紫貂在今年6月份却没有发情的征候。大家便按照一般牲畜实行人工配种的规律，以妊马血（怀孕40—100天的母马血液）催情，并在食物中混合植物性的性激素进行试验。结果，三天后开始发情。这一期间，饲养人员从午夜二时进入了望台，记录着貂的交配情况。有时还把笼舍转移到附近森林中，以适当的自然环境促进紫貂配种。最后，这些只经过九个月人工饲养的紫貂中，已有三对配了种。
    人工养貂两年内不能繁殖的迷信，开始被冲破了！
