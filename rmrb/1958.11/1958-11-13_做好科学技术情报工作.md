    Do a Good Job in Science and Technology Intelligence Work
    With the leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, the working people are making great efforts in technological revolution, and inventions and creations are emerging everywhere at an unprecedented speed and quantity. The in-depth development of the technological revolution requires that science and technology intelligence work keep up, rapidly disseminate and introduce the creative inventions and scientific research achievements of the masses, and promptly publicize the gains of individuals or individual departments, making them the valuable property of the people of the whole country.
    Recently, under the leadership of the Party, the masses have created various methods for exchanging scientific and technological intelligence and materials; the scientific and technological intelligence work carried out by economic, technical, scientific, and educational departments in various parts of the country is colorful. The vigorous publicity of various newspapers across the country, the holding of exhibitions, experience exchange meetings, on-site meetings, short-term training courses, and the publication of quick reports, good news reports, and technical materials have played a significant role in promoting China's production and scientific research. For example, after the experience of indigenous methods of iron and steel smelting was disseminated, a large amount of steel was produced in a short period of time. Furthermore, after the intelligence and data on the development of the machinery industry and the indigenous manufacture of machine tools were rapidly disseminated, counties and townships could manufacture machine tools and various machinery and equipment. The Party and the government, as well as economic departments, relying on scientific and technological intelligence data, further explored the development prospects of the work, revised and supplemented blueprints, determined the direction and policies of technological development, and led the technological revolution movement forward.
    At present, China's science and technology intelligence work is far from keeping up with the needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and scientific research. Many domestic inventions and creations cannot be quickly centralized; many achievements of universal significance cannot be promoted in a timely manner; many directional creations have not been systematically introduced. Although some intelligence agencies have been established in various regions, departments, and units, they have not yet formed an intelligence network with interconnected veins and division of labor and cooperation. Therefore, how to rapidly carry out China's science and technology intelligence work nationwide to better promote production and scientific research has become an urgent task at present.
    The guiding principle of science and technology intelligence work is to serve socialist construction, that is, to serve the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Science and technology intelligence work must be aimed at the needs of completing production plans and scientific research plans with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and collect and provide intelligence data in a planned and purposeful manner. These materials are most urgently needed by various regions and units. After the enthusiasm of the broad masses for socialist construction is highly organized, they need methods and scientific and technological intelligence data. If they master these new methods and intelligence data, they can change the face of production in a very short period of time. Many regions and units have recognized the importance of science and technology intelligence work in their work practice and have changed the practice of simply "setting targets in spring, summer, autumn, and winter and calculating figures all year round." They attach importance to science and technology work, and therefore also attach importance to science and technology intelligence work, and urgently require science and technology intelligence work to serve production and construction. This is a natural thing. Science and technology intelligence work should actively serve the current production and construction and supply the urgently needed intelligence in all aspects, which is the main aspect. However, science and technology intelligence work should also study the development trends of science and technology in accordance with the Party's policy of developing science and technology, pay close attention to major inventions and creations at home and abroad, and report new discoveries and achievements in science and technology in a timely manner.
    A large number of China's scientific and technological inventions and creations come from the working people. The working people can create and invent, and they can and need to promote and popularize them so that more people can master science and technology. Therefore, science and technology intelligence work should also follow the mass line and mobilize everyone to do it. The view that science and technology intelligence work is very "mysterious" and should only be done by a few people is incorrect. The broad masses of the working people in China can master science and technology, and our Party and country create conditions in all aspects for them to master science and technology, which is fundamentally different from the bourgeoisie's monopoly of science and technology in capitalist countries. This year, the "temple fairs" held by various industries in Shanghai had more than 190,000 visits by the masses to learn from each other's technical revolution experiences, and more than 16,000 technical problems were solved by mutual assistance among units. The masses reflected that they had "found the golden key to open the treasure mountain." In the technical revolution movement, the masses were mobilized and created amazing achievements on the fronts of industrial and agricultural production and scientific research, and at the same time created lively and flexible methods of intelligence work.
    Science and technology intelligence work should mobilize the masses to participate, but it also requires full-time intelligence work organizations. It is necessary to combine full-time intelligence work organizations with mass-based science and technology intelligence work. Science and technology are changing rapidly, and it is necessary to continuously provide new and even newer intelligence, from simple to complex, from low-level to high-level. There must be full-time intelligence work organizations responsible for collecting and summarizing, comprehensively analyzing, systematically studying, rapidly reporting, and supplying in a timely manner in order to complete this major task. Science and technology intelligence workers should strengthen their service concept and correct their service attitude. It is wrong to only pay attention to collecting and整理 intelligence materials without paying attention to reporting and supplying intelligence. It should be known that collecting and 整理 intelligence materials is for the purpose of reporting and supplying them, otherwise the intelligence will become "antiques" and they themselves will become "antique connoisseurs." Intelligence workers should strive to be proactive in their work, broaden their horizons, and not "wait for people to come to the door," but "go to the door."
    China's science and technology is developing rapidly, and inventions and creations are blooming everywhere. Intelligence work urgently needs to keep up. There are ideological obstacles to carrying out science and technology intelligence work. Some units have solved the scientific and technological problems of their own units, but they are afraid of trouble and have not organized them into materials or documents for reference by other departments. As a result, only one unit has increased its production speed, while the vast majority of units cannot make a leap forward. Being "afraid of trouble" has reduced a lot of output in the motherland's production, causing real trouble. As for some people who hold on to departmentalism and are unwilling to hand over their own or their department's inventions and creations to the people, that is completely unacceptable and is a reflection of bourgeois ideology. The cause we are engaged in today is a cause for the whole people, a cause of unparalleled nobility. Those who only see individuals or their own units, but not the collective and the whole people, cannot adapt to the requirements of socialist construction. We must promote the noble style of communism, promote new inventions in a timely manner, and exchange good creations immediately. If this work is done well, not only can production be greatly improved, but also the creative inventions of the masses can inspire each other, which can greatly promote the development of the technical revolution movement. Intelligence agencies at all levels should put politics in command, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, implement the mass line, coordinate the forces of all aspects in carrying out science and technology intelligence work, and organize a nationwide intelligence network with interconnected veins. The view that intelligence work should establish its own independent system, ignoring the leadership of the Party, is a manifestation of emphasizing business and neglecting politics, which is not conducive to our cause. Intelligence workers should, under the leadership of the Party, use Marxist ideology to guide their work and apply the rich experience gained by the Party from revolutionary practice and construction practice to intelligence work.
    China is carrying out socialist construction and preparing conditions for an early transition to communism. Under this situation of comprehensive leap forward, the demand for scientific and technological intelligence is extremely broad in all aspects, and cannot be limited to one corner, so it must be broad; and all aspects require scientific and technological intelligence to be fast and accurate. Therefore, the task of China's science and technology intelligence work is very arduous. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and following the mass line, science and technology intelligence work can be done broadly, quickly, and accurately, which will help promote socialist construction and realize communism ahead of schedule.

    做好科学技术情报工作
    随着我国工农业生产的跃进，劳动人民大闹技术革命，发明创造到处涌现，速度之快，数量之多，真是史无前例。技术革命的深入发展，就要求科学技术情报工作能够跟得上去，迅速传播和介绍群众的创造发明和科学研究成果，使个别人或个别部门的收获，及时宣传，成为全国人民的宝贵财产。
    最近一个时期以来，在党的领导下，群众创造了多种多样的交流科学技术情报和资料的方法；全国各地经济、技术、科学、教育等部门进行的科学技术情报工作丰富多彩。全国各种报纸的大力宣传，各地举办展览会、经验交流会、现场会议、短期训练班和出版快报、捷报、技术资料，对推动我国生产和科学研究有很大的作用。例如土法炼铁、炼钢的经验传播以后，在短短的时间内增产了大量的钢铁。又如发展机械工业、土造机床的情报资料迅速传播后，县县乡乡都可以制造工作母机和各种机器设备。党和政府以及经济部门，依靠了科学技术情报资料，进一步探讨工作的发展远景，修改和补充蓝图，决定技术发展的方针政策，领导技术革命运动前进。
    目前，我国科学技术情报工作，还远远赶不上工农业生产和科学研究大跃进的需要。国内的许多发明创造，不能迅速地集中起来；许多有普遍意义的成就，不能得到及时推广；许多具有方向性的创造，没有作系统的介绍。虽然各地区、各部门、各单位建立了一些情报机构，但是还没有形成一个脉络相通、分工协作的情报网。因此，如何使我国科学技术情报工作在全国范围内迅速开展起来，更好地推动生产和科学研究工作，已经成为当前迫切的任务。
    科学技术情报工作的方针是为社会主义建设服务，也就是为多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线服务。科学技术情报工作，必须针对多快好省地完成生产计划和科学研究计划的需要，有计划有目的地搜集和提供情报资料。这些资料是各地区、各单位最迫切需要的。广大群众的社会主义建设的积极性被高度组织起来以后，就需要办法，需要科学技术情报资料，如果他们一经掌握这些新的办法和情报资料，就可以在很短的时间内改变生产面貌。许多地区和许多单位在工作实践中已经认识到科学技术情报工作的重要性，已经改变了那种单纯的“春夏秋冬订指标，一年四季算数字”的做法，重视科学技术工作，因而也重视科学技术的情报工作，迫切要求科学技术情报工作为生产建设服务。这是很自然的事情。科学技术情报工作应该积极为当前的生产建设服务，供给各方面所迫切需要的情报，这是主要的方面。但是，科学技术情报工作还应该根据党的发展科学技术的方针，研究科学技术的发展动向，密切注意国内外的重大发明创造，及时报道科学技术的新发现和新成就。
    我国的科学技术的发明创造大量地来自劳动人民。劳动人民能够创造发明，也就能够而且需要宣传推广，使更多的人来掌握科学技术。因此，科学技术情报工作也应当走群众路线，发动大家来办。那种把科学技术情报工作看得很“神秘”，认为只应由少数人来办的看法是不对的。我国广大劳动群众能够掌握科学技术，而且我们的党和国家从各方面创造条件使他们掌握科学技术，同资本主义国家中的资产阶级垄断科学技术根本不同。今年上海举办的各业“庙会”，参观的群众互相学习技术革命经验即达十九万多项次，各单位互相帮助解决技术问题一万六千多项。群众反映是，“找到金钥匙，打开万宝山”。在技术革命运动中，群众动员起来，在工农业生产以及科学研究战线上创造了惊人的成绩，同时创造了生动活泼的作情报工作方法。
    科学技术情报工作要动员群众参加，但是，也需要专职的情报工作机构。要使专职情报工作机构同群众性的科学技术情报工作结合起来。科学技术日新月异，需要不断提供新的以至更新的情报，从简单到复杂，从低级到高级，必须有专职的情报工作机构，负责搜集汇总，全面分析，系统研究，迅速报道，及时供应，才能完成这项重大任务。科学技术情报工作干部要加强服务观点，端正服务态度。那种只注意搜集和整理情报资料，而不注意报道和供应情报是不对的。要知道搜集和整理情报资料，就是为了报道和供应，不然就会使情报变成“古董”，而自己变成“古董鉴赏家”了。情报工作者在自己的工作中要争取主动，放宽视野，不要“等上门来”，而要“找上门去”。
    我国的科学技术飞跃发展，发明创造遍地开花，情报工作亟需跟上去。开展科学技术情报工作是有思想障碍的。有的单位解决了本单位的科学技术问题，可是却怕麻烦，没有把它整理成资料或文献，供给其它部门参考。于是，只有一个单位生产提高了速度，绝大多数的单位却不能跃进。“怕麻烦”一下，就使祖国生产减少了很多的产量，造成了真正的麻烦。至于有的人抱有本位主义思想，不肯把自己的或本部门的发明创造交给人民群众，那是完全要不得的，是资产阶级思想的反映。我们今天所从事的事业是全民的事业，是无比崇高的事业。那种只看到个人或者本单位，而看不到集体和全民的眼光，是不能适应社会主义建设的要求的。我们要发扬共产主义的崇高风格，有新发明及时推广，有好创造马上交流。如果把这个工作做好，不但可以大大提高生产，同时群众的创造发明互相启发，那就可以大大推动技术革命运动的发展。各级情报机构应该政治挂帅，在各级党组织的领导下，贯彻群众路线，把各方面进行科学技术情报资料工作的力量协调起来，组织起全国脉络相通的情报网。那种认为情报工作应该建立自己的独立系统，忽视党的领导，是重业务，轻政治的一种表现，是不利于我们的事业的。情报工作者应该在党的领导下，运用马克思主义的思想来指导工作，把党从革命实践中和建设实践中所得的丰富经验运用到情报工作中来。
    我国正在进行社会主义建设，并为提前过渡到共产主义准备条件。在这个全面大跃进的形势下面，各方面要求科学技术情报极其广泛，不能限于一隅，所以要广；各方面又要求科学技术情报要快，要精确。因此，我国科学技术情报工作的任务很繁重。我们相信，在党的领导下，走群众路线，一定可以把科学技术情报工作做得又广、又快、又精，有助于推动社会主义建设和提前实现共产主义。
