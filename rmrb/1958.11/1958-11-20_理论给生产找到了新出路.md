Theory Finds a New Way Out for Production
    Xinhua

    Half a year ago, the Lalin Town Leather Cooperative in Wuchang County had a large backlog of "wula" (traditional winter boots) that couldn't be sold, and the workers' morale was low. After the Party branch led everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, the workers' minds were opened. The "wula" workers found a way out for production from "On Contradiction," switching to manufacturing basketballs, which sold well throughout Northeast China.

    In the process of studying "On Contradiction," the workers realized that the development process of everything is full of contradictions. Because people's living standards have improved, wearing leather shoes is better than wearing "wula," thus creating the contradiction between the production and sales of "wula."

    Only by finding contradictions and resolving contradictions can production continuously develop. The workers proposed: now that sports activities are greatly developed, changing to making basketballs will definitely have a market. However, conservative ideas were like stumbling blocks along the way. Some people said: It's useless without basketball making skills. Just as the way out to resolve the production and sales contradiction was found, a new contradiction arose between wanting to produce basketballs and not knowing how to make them. The workers said, this is truly a contradiction that runs through the entire development process of things; if there is a contradiction, solve it, if you don't know, learn it. So, they sent people to Shuangcheng to learn the technique. The first basketball was made, and it looked like a big watermelon. Some workers lost heart, but some workers believed that through practice, understanding, and more practice, they would definitely make qualified basketballs. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party branch, they summarized experience, continued to produce, and sent people to Harbin to learn and improve their skills. The second basketball was made, and the technical appraisal was at the third level. Advanced workers were not convinced, but some workers were satisfied. The Party branch pointed out that this was a contradiction between the advanced and the backward, and another debate was launched. In this continuous process of contradictions arising and being resolved, the basketballs reached domestic standards. The workers said: It's really good to study theory! Combining the study of theory with the development of production allows one to not only understand the theory but also improve production.

    理论给生产找到了新出路
    新华
    五常县拉林镇皮革社半年前因生产的靰鞡卖不出去，大量积压，工人生产情绪低落。经过党支部领导大家学习了毛主席的著作，工人的脑筋开了窍。靰鞡工人从“矛盾论”中找到了生产的出路，改行制造篮球，畅销东北各地。
    工人在学习“矛盾论”的过程中认识到一切事物发展过程都充满着矛盾。因为人民生活提高了，穿皮鞋比穿靰鞡好，这样就发生了靰鞡的产销矛盾。
    找出了矛盾，解决矛盾，才能使生产不断发展。工人提出：现在体育运动大大开展，改制篮球一定会有销路。但是，保守思想像绊脚石一样随路都有。有的人说：不会篮球手艺是白搭。解决产销矛盾的出路刚找到，要生产篮球和不会篮球手艺又发生了新的矛盾。工人说，这真是事物发展过程中自始至终贯穿着矛盾；有矛盾就解决，不会就学。于是，派人去双城学技术。第一只篮球制成了，样子像个大西瓜。有的工人就泄了气，有的工人却相信实践、认识、再实践，一定会制成合格的篮球。于是，他们在党支部领导下总结经验，继续制作，并派人到哈尔滨学习提高技术。第二个篮球制成了，技术鉴定是三级。先进工人不服气，有的工人却满足了。党支部指出这是先进和落后的矛盾，又掀起一场争论。就在这样不断出现矛盾，不断解决矛盾的过程中，篮球达到了国内标准。工人说：学习理论真好！把学习理论和发展生产紧密结合起来，就能既学懂了理论，又提高了生产。
