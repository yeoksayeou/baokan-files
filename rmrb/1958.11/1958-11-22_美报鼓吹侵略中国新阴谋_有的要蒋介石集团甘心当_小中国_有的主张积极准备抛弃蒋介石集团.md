Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch from Boston: The "Christian Science Monitor" published a dispatch from Taipei by William Stringer, demanding that the Chiang Kai-shek clique accept the U.S.-manufactured "Two Chinas" plot, contenting themselves with playing the role of a "Small China" designated by the United States in Taiwan.

Stringer said in the dispatch that non-official figures in Taiwan believe that "the Quemoy [Kinmen] incident marks a turning point in the decline of the Kuomintang's cause." He also said that some senior officials in the Chiang Kai-shek clique privately agree with this point.

Starting from this point, Stringer wants the Chiang Kai-shek clique to follow the "Small China" path according to the wishes of the United States. He wrote, "The Quemoy incident may have forever ended the Kuomintang's hope of retaking the mainland with the help of U.S. nuclear weapons. However, this incident has not deprived the Kuomintang of the opportunity to be such a regime—another China." According to Stringer's opinion, the Chiang Kai-shek clique can only "more realistically" play such a role for its "cause to continue to flourish."

Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch from Washington: The "Washington Post" published a "letter to the editor" on November 11, requesting the U.S. government to consider replacing Assistant Secretary of State Robertson, who has consistently advocated for aid to the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The letter said: Robertson "has been, and will always be, an open advocate of the pro-Nationalist China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique) policy." In 1953, the government appointed him to his current position to "appease the strong demands of the pro-Nationalist China (Chiang Kai-shek clique) policy advocates." However, now, due to changes in the situation, the requirements for the position of Assistant Secretary of State have changed, "and it is now time to consider removing Robertson's name from the government list."

This letter blatantly advocated for the U.S. policy of abandoning Chiang Kai-shek, saying: "There is no longer a need for advocates of the pro-Nationalist China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique) policy; what is needed now is someone who can make good use of his subordinates' best and most comprehensive practical assessments of every factor in the complex and currently extremely important diplomatic relations between the United States and China and China's neighbors. Experts are very clear that under Mr. Robertson's leadership, this is absolutely impossible."

### 美报鼓吹侵略中国新阴谋  有的要蒋介石集团甘心当“小中国”  有的主张积极准备抛弃蒋介石集团

    美报鼓吹侵略中国新阴谋
    有的要蒋介石集团甘心当“小中国”
    有的主张积极准备抛弃蒋介石集团
    新华社20日讯　波士顿消息：“基督教科学箴言报”发表的威廉·斯特林格发自台北的一条电讯，要求蒋介石集团接受美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，甘心于在台湾充当美国所指定的“小中国”的角色。
    斯特林格在电讯中说，台湾非官方人士认为，“金门事件标志着国民党事业走向衰败的转折点”。他还说，蒋介石集团某些高级官员私下也同意这一点。
    斯特林格从这一点出发要蒋介石集团按照美国的心意，走“小中国”的道路。他写道，“金门事件可能已经永远结束了国民党在美国核武器帮助下打回大陆的希望。但是，这一事件并没有使国民党丧失作为这样一种政权——另一个中国——的机会”。据斯特林格的意见，蒋介石集团只有“更现实地”充当这样的角色，它的“事业才会继续兴旺”。
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：“华盛顿邮报”11月11日刊载了一封“读者来信”，要求美国政府考虑撤换一贯鼓吹援助蒋介石集团的助理国务卿罗伯逊。
    这封信说：罗伯逊“一直是，而且将永远是亲国民党中国（指蒋介石集团）政策的公开鼓吹者”。1953年政府任命他担任现职，是为了“平息亲国民党中国（蒋介石集团）政策鼓吹者的强硬主张”。但是，现在，由于事态的变迁，对所担任的助理国务卿职务的要求已经改变，“现在已经是考虑把罗伯逊的名字从政府名单上勾销的时候了。”
    这封信露骨地鼓吹美国抛弃蒋介石的政策，它说：“现在已经不再需要亲国民党中国（指蒋介石集团）政策的鼓吹者；现在需要的是这样一种人，他应该能够很好地运用自己部下对于复杂而目前又极其重要的美国同中国及中国邻国之间的外交关系中的每一个因素所作出的最好、最充分的在行的估价。专家们非常清楚，在罗伯逊先生领导下，这种事情绝对办不到。”
