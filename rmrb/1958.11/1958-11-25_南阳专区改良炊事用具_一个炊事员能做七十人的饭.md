    Nanyang Special District Improves Cooking Utensils
    One Cook Can Prepare Food for Seventy People

    (Our Dispatch) A tool reform movement to improve the efficiency of canteen work is being carried out comprehensively in the Nanyang Special District of Henan. Six counties in this special district, including Biyang, Dengxian, and Zhenping, have created and invented more than 15,000 pieces of various cooking tools.

    After communization in the Nanyang Special District, collective living was generally realized. Due to lack of experience, many canteens had only one cook preparing food for thirty people, and the problem of milling flour was particularly difficult. In order to improve the efficiency of canteen work, the Nanyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a cooking utensil reform meeting in Biyang County, which had done a good job in canteen work. After this meeting, all counties took the secretary as the leader, with Party and League members taking the lead, fully utilizing the wisdom of the masses, creating many new cooking tools, and improving many stoves. Comrade Li Zhongtang, director of Chengang Management District in Biyang, invented an automated water-powered double mill, which can produce more than 3,000 jin of flour per day. It does not require animal power and only needs one person to manage it, increasing work efficiency by twenty-five times compared to donkey-pulled mills. The small steel mill invented in Nanyang County is fully automated and can produce more than 2,000 jin of flour per day. At the same time, various places also launched a fuel-saving stove improvement movement. 60% of the stoves in the entire special district have been improved. After the improvement, a canteen serving 300 people only needs one person to stoke the fire, saving two people compared to the original. The original stoves required one jin and ten liang of firewood per person per day, but after the improvement, only twelve liang of firewood per person per day is needed. The Yaoyuan Village public canteen in Biyang County, which serves 281 people, invented a "locomotive" stove. This stove has six pots arranged in four rows, front and back, for cooking rice, steaming buns, and stir-frying dishes. It used to take four hours to prepare a meal, but now it has been shortened to two hours, and the number of cooks has been reduced by 30%. Dengxian County mainly focuses on developing biogas to save firewood. More than 2,100 biogas pits have been built in the county. The water wheel-powered slicer invented in Nanyang County can slice 140,000 jin per day, increasing work efficiency by about 140 times compared to manual labor. The noodle press created in Liuquanpu, Zhenping County, puts sweet potato mash into the machine, and the noodles produced are long and thin. In Biyang County, due to the creation of twelve kinds of tools such as wooden noodle rolling machines and vegetable cutting machines, a large number of manpower and animal power have been saved. In the past, combatants from each class were drawn to cut vegetables, but now a vegetable cutting machine is more efficient than twenty people cutting vegetables. According to statistics from 396 canteens in the county, after the reform of cooking utensils, a total of 696 laborers have been saved. The efficiency of each person cooking has increased from only preparing food for thirty people to preparing food for seventy people. (Zhang Lizhong)

    南阳专区改良炊事用具
    一个炊事员能做七十人的饭
    本报讯　以提高食堂工作效率的工具改革运动在河南南阳专区全面开展。这个专区的泌阳、邓县、镇平等六个县，已创造发明各种炊事工具共一万五千多件。
    南阳专区公社化以后，普遍实现了生活集体化。由于经验不足，许多食堂一个炊事员只做三十个人的饭，特别是磨面问题更感到吃力。中共南阳地委为了提高食堂工作效率，在食堂工作做得好的泌阳县召开了各县炊具改革会议。在这次会议以后，各县都以书记挂帅，党、团员带头，充分发挥群众的智慧，创造了许多炊事新工具和改进了不少炉灶。泌阳陈岗管理区主任李仲堂同志，发明水打自动化双磨，每天可产面粉三千多斤，不用畜力，只用一人照顾，比驴拉磨提高工效二十五倍。南阳县发明的小钢磨全部自动化，每天可产面粉二千斤以上。同时各地还开展了节约燃料改良锅灶运动。全专区改良的锅灶达60％，经过改良的锅灶，三百人吃饭的食堂，只要一个人烧火，比原来节省二人。原来的锅灶每人每天需烧柴一斤十两，改良后，每人每天只用十二两柴就够了。泌阳县姚园村公共食堂共二百八十一人吃饭，他们发明了一种火车头锅灶，这种灶六个锅前后分为四排，做饭、蒸馍、炒菜，做一顿饭过去用四小时，现在缩短为两小时，还减少了30％的炊事员。邓县以搞沼气为主节约烧柴。全县已修建沼气坑二千一百多个。南阳县发明的水车头切片机，每天能切片十四万斤，比人力提高工效一百四十倍左右。镇平县柳泉铺创造的压面机，把红薯泥放进机器内，制出的面条又长又细。泌阳县由于创制出木制轧面条机、切菜机等十二种工具，节省了大批的人、畜力，过去切菜抽各班的战斗员，现在一个切菜机比二十个人切菜的效率还高。据全县三百九十六个食堂统计，炊具改革后，共节约劳力六百九十六名，每人做饭效率，由每人只做三十人的饭，提高做七十人的饭。　（张励中）
