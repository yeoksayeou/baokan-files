    苏联棉农足球队到北京
    今天战八一队　后天战长春队
    本报讯　应邀来我国访问的苏联乌兹别克塔什干棉农足球队全部队员已于昨日到达北京。在北京比赛的日程已经排定。今天下午对八一队，28日战长春队。
    塔什干棉农足球队成立于1954年，是今年全苏乙级联赛第四名，全队除右前卫麦卡苏特夫是运动健将外，其余都是一级运动员。大部分队员是乌兹别克共和国的国手。
    棉农队队员特点是：守门员身高，动作敏捷，反应尚快；右后卫体能好，抢球主动，经常到前场助攻；中卫积极主动，善于紧盯人，人高头球好；两翼速度快，善于内锋配合打二过一。
    塔什干棉农队曾同我国足球队作过两场比赛。去年联二队访问阿富汗，路过塔什干以1比1同棉农队踢平，今年长春队访苏，也以2比2同棉农队打平。
