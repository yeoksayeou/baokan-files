Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Shanghai's advanced producer and the chief mechanical engineer of the New Shanghai Steel Plant, Zheng Fuyou, who came from a working-class background, has mastered the world's new technology of hot rolling gears using extremely simple indigenous methods. He used a coal stove, an old-fashioned belt lathe, and a self-made rolling mill to roll out a batch of spur gears. The average rolling time for each gear, including loading and unloading the workpiece, was only one and a half minutes, increasing efficiency by eighty to one hundred times compared to cutting methods. This batch of gears, after technical appraisal, had a smooth surface and reached the third-grade standard of precision, with quality even better than those milled by the machine repair shop using a hobbing machine. The factory has now received a batch of lathe gear processing tasks and is only waiting for the mechanical manufacturing plant to help manufacture rolling mills so that they can mass-produce hot-rolled gears. Otherwise, mass production will still be difficult.

Gears are indispensable parts for transmitting power in machines. An ordinary six-foot lathe has sixty to seventy gears of various sizes. Gear processing has always adopted cutting methods, and even a small gear takes two hours to process. Therefore, improving gear processing efficiency has become a key issue in accelerating machine production.

Hot rolling gears involves using pressure to roll gears, similar to rolling steel. This method can not only dramatically increase production efficiency but also improve gear quality, extend service life, and save a large amount of metal materials. Therefore, countries around the world have been researching and experimenting with it in recent years. However, to date, foreign hot rolling gear methods generally use very complex specialized equipment, so not many have officially used this new technology.

The hot rolling gear method created by Zheng Fuyou has great promotional value. Mechanical factories in general small and medium-sized cities can manufacture a complete set of equipment themselves.

Zheng Fuyou is now also studying how to improve hot rolling technology so that he can use hot rolling methods to produce special specifications of gears such as helical gears and herringbone gears in the future.

    用土法掌握世界新技术
    郑富有创热轧齿轮法效率增百倍
    据新华社讯　上海市先进生产者、新沪钢铁厂工人出身的总机械师郑富有，用极简单的土办法掌握了热轧齿轮世界新技术。他用一只煤炉、一台老式皮带车床和自己制造的轧辊，轧出了一批正齿轮，平均每只轧制时间包括装卸工作物在内，只有一分半钟，比切削法加工齿轮效率提高八十倍到一百倍。这批齿轮经技术鉴定，表面光洁，精度达到三级标准，质量比机修车间用滚床铣出来的还要好。现在这个厂已经接到一批车床齿轮的加工任务，只待机械制造厂帮助制造轧棍，就可大批生产热轧齿轮。否则，大批生产还有困难。
    齿轮是机器传送动力不可缺少的零件，一台普通的六呎车床，就有大小齿轮六、七十只。加工齿轮一向采取切削方法，一只小小的齿轮也要加工两小时。因此提高齿轮加工效率，成为加速生产机器的一个关键问题。
    热轧齿轮就是像轧钢一样把齿轮用压力轧出来。这种方法不但可以使生产效率惊人地提高，还可改善齿轮质量，延长使用寿命和节约大量金属材料。因此，近年来世界各国都在研究试用。但到目前为止，国外热轧齿轮方法一般都是用很复杂的专用设备，因此正式使用这一新技术的还不多。
    郑富有所创造的热轧齿轮的方法，具有很大的推广价值，一般中小城市的机械工厂都可以自己制造全套设备。
    郑富有现在还在研究提高热轧技术，以便将来用热轧法生产斜齿轮、人字齿轮等特殊规格的齿轮。
