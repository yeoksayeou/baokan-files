    Participating in Labor Offers Many Avenues; Ideological Training Brings Great Gains
    Cadres at All Levels in Anhui Province Show a New Look After Participating in Labor

    (Reported by this newspaper) Cadres at all levels in Anhui Province are actively participating in labor training through various forms. By participating in labor, cadres have greatly improved their labor viewpoint, further strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses, and vigorously promoted work, bringing about a new situation in various tasks.

    The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to organizing cadres at all levels to participate in labor training. As early as 1955, some cadres were assigned to participate in production. Since 1957, in conjunction with the reorganization work, a total of 121,300 cadres throughout the province have been assigned to agricultural cooperatives and factories for labor training, and to grassroots units for work training.

    There are many forms of organizing cadres to participate in labor training. In addition to being assigned to labor training, the following forms have also been widely adopted: First, government offices run their own factories and farms, organizing on-the-job cadres to participate in labor training in rotation. According to statistics from the provincial government directly affiliated organizations alone, 194 factories and farms have been established, and 206 small blast furnaces for iron smelting have been put into production. Recently, steel smelting has also been widely carried out, with an average of more than 7,000 cadres participating in steel and iron smelting every day. Second, cadres are universally planting high-yield experimental fields. According to incomplete statistics from the Wuhu and Bengbu special districts in August, 79,815 cadres at the county, township, and cooperative levels participated in planting high-yield experimental fields, planting 185,983 mu of experimental fields. Third, combining the transfer of cadres to help with central work or conduct work pilots, organize work teams. After going down, they participate in grassroots work on the one hand and labor on the other. According to incomplete statistics from provincial government directly affiliated organizations from February to September, more than 2,100 cadres were transferred to various places to help with cooperative reorganization, inspect spring plowing production, fight drought, and inspect steel production. The Wuhu special district adopted the form of work teams, transferring more than 7,000 cadres to grassroots units to participate in labor and do grassroots work. Fourth, in the busy farming season, cadres take turns going to the countryside to participate in short-term labor, as well as temporarily participating in various voluntary labor. This year, during the fight against drought, rush harvesting, and rush planting, a large number of cadres were transferred to the countryside to participate in labor in rotation throughout the province. During the intense drought resistance stage in July this year, the Hefei municipal government directly affiliated organizations dispatched 70% to 80% of the cadres to take turns participating in the drought resistance struggle in the suburbs. Fifth, factories have implemented the "two participations and one reform" (cadres participate in production, workers participate in management, and reform rules and regulations), and stores have implemented the "three participations and one reform" (cadres participate in business, salespersons participate in management, the masses participate in supervision, and reform rules and regulations), and management personnel have also universally participated in production labor.

    Cadres in various places have already gained huge harvests from participating in labor training. First of all, it has raised the communist consciousness of cadres and cultivated their labor viewpoint. For example, more than 300 cadres from the provincial political and legal departments who were assigned to the Huayanghe Farm, undaunted by difficulties, insisted on doing farm work in the rain, eating in the fields with umbrellas, ensuring the timely completion of the sowing task of more than 2,000 mu of cotton fields. Many cadres have also increased their production knowledge and learned production techniques during labor, opening up a path for cadres to be both red and expert, red to the core and deeply expert. Many cadres assigned to the countryside have generally learned agricultural production techniques such as sowing, transplanting, weeding, fertilizing, and field management. Comrades assigned to factories have generally initially mastered operating techniques, and some have become relatively skilled technicians. For example, among the 583 cadres assigned to five coal mines in Huainan City, those who have reached levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 account for 80.8%; among the 36 leading cadres of the Hefei knitwear, cork, and flour factories, after participating in follow-the-shift labor, five people reached level 3, thirteen people reached level 2, ten people were able to master basic operating techniques, and the other eight people also improved a step on the basis of their original technology. Cadres participating in labor have also gained rich experience in grassroots work and practical work.

    Second, the participation of cadres in labor has strengthened the backbone force of grassroots units and production units, vigorously promoted industrial and agricultural production and other tasks, and promoted the technical revolution and cultural revolution. For example, the cadres assigned to the countryside in Su County are distributed in 29 relatively backward production teams. After the efforts of the assigned cadres and the in-depth mobilization of the masses, 22 production teams have now leaped into advanced teams, and 7 backward teams have also changed their appearance. After cadres at all levels widely plant experimental fields, and cadres in factories and enterprises implement the follow-the-shift labor system, they have greatly changed their leadership style, overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism, and promoted work and production. When the township cadres of Liwu Township, Fengyang County, discovered wheat rust disease in their experimental fields, they immediately organized cooperative and team cadres to study, learn technology, and carry out prevention and control. In less than five days, the wheat rust disease was eliminated throughout the township. The cadres assigned to participate in labor also actively helped the countryside establish various schools, carry out literacy and other cultural and educational work, and actively lead the masses to carry out technical reforms. The cadres assigned to the Bengbu special district worked with the masses to research, create, and improve tools. In the first half of the year alone, according to incomplete statistics, there were 88 inventions, creations, and improved tools, as well as successfully trial-produced new products.

    Third, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been strengthened. The broad masses of people truly realized that the cadres were working for them, and therefore loved the Party and the government even more. They said, "You are as hardworking as we are, for the sake of our good life. Only cadres under the leadership of the Communist Party can do this." Many cadres have been elected as production models. For example, among the 14 cadres of the Provincial Communist Youth League who were assigned to Fulixiang, Su County, four were rated as advanced producers in the county, and this group was also rated as a red flag group. Many assigned cadres have also been elected as Party representatives and people's representatives.

    Fourth, they directly created wealth for the country and contributed material strength to socialist construction. According to statistics from the financial and trade system in April this year alone, there were more than 39,000 cadres assigned last year and this year, of which more than 9,000 were assigned last year, with a total output value of more than 395 million yuan; more than 30,000 cadres assigned this year are planning to produce an output value of 997 million yuan. More than 36,000 cadres in the Bengbu special district planted experimental fields, planting a total of 28,000 mu of experimental fields, which can harvest about 100 million jin of grain throughout the year.

    Now, a trend has formed throughout the province for cadres at all levels to participate in labor training. Especially since the large-scale iron and steel smelting began, cadres in various places have been fighting selflessly day and night on the steel front, and the participation of cadres in labor has entered a new climax.

    The Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has run an affiliated knitting factory for government offices, installed twelve electric sock knitting machines, and cadres go to the factory to participate in production, which can weave more than 40 dozen pairs of socks every day.

    参加劳动门路多　思想锻炼收获大
    安徽省各级干部参加劳动后气象一新
    本报讯　安徽省各级干部采取多种多样的形式积极参加劳动锻炼。通过参加劳动，大大提高了干部的劳动观点，进一步密切了党和群众的关系，有力地推动了工作，使各种工作出现了一个崭新的局面。
    中共安徽省委对组织各级干部参加劳动锻炼很重视，早在1955年即下放部分干部参加生产。1957年以来，全省结合整编工作，下放到农业社、工厂进行劳动锻炼和下放到基层工作锻炼的干部共达十二万一千三百多人。
    组织干部参加劳动锻炼的形式是多种多样的，除了下放劳动锻炼以外，还广泛采取了以下各种形式：第一，机关自办工厂和农场，组织在职干部轮流参加劳动锻炼。仅据省直属机关统计，已办工厂、农场一百九十四个，已投入生产的炼铁小高炉有二百零六座，最近还广泛开展了炼钢，平均每天参加炼钢炼铁的干部达七千多人。第二，干部普遍种丰产试验田。据芜湖、蚌埠专区8月份不完全统计，县乡社各级干部参加种丰产试验田的干部达七万九千八百十五人，种试验田十八万五千九百八十三亩。第三，结合抽调干部下去帮助中心工作或搞工作试点，组织工作队，下去后一面参加基层工作，一面劳动。据省直属机关2月到9月不完全统计，抽调到各地帮助整社、检查春耕生产、抗旱、检查钢铁生产的干部有二千一百多人。芜湖专区采用工作队的形式，抽调七千多名干部下放到基层，一面参加劳动，一面做基层工作。第四，在农忙季节，干部轮流下乡参加短期劳动，以及临时参加其他各种义务劳动。今年在抗旱、抢收、抢种中全省各地都抽调了大批干部轮流下乡参加劳动。合肥市直属机关在今年7月抗旱紧张阶段，抽出70％到80％的干部轮流到郊区参加抗旱斗争。第五，工厂实行了“两参一改”（干部参加生产，工人参加管理，改革规章制度），商店实行“三参一改”
  （干部参加营业，营业员参加管理，群众参加监督，改革规章制度），管理人员也普遍参加了生产劳动。
    各地干部参加劳动锻炼已经有了巨大的收获。首先，提高了干部的共产主义觉悟，培养了干部的劳动观点，如省政法部门下放到华阳河农场的三百多名干部，不怕困难，冒雨坚持干农活，在田里打着伞吃饭，保证及时完成二千多亩棉田的播种任务。很多干部在劳动中还增长了生产知识，学到了生产技术，为干部又红又专、红透专深开辟了道路。下放到农村的很多干部，一般都已学会了播种、栽秧、锄田、施肥、田间管理等农业生产技术，下放到工厂的同志一般都初步掌握了操作技术，有些人已成为比较熟练的技工。如淮南市下放到五个煤矿的五百八十三名干部中，现在达到二、三、四、五级工的占80.8％；合肥市针织、软木、面粉三个厂三十六位领导干部，参加跟班劳动以后，有五个人达到三级工，十三人达到二级工，十个人能掌握基本操作技术，其他八个人也在原有的技术基础上提高了一步。参加劳动的干部还取得了丰富的基层工作和实际工作的经验。
    第二，干部参加劳动，加强了基层单位和生产单位的骨干力量，有力地推动了工农业生产和其他各项工作，促进了技术革命和文化革命。如宿县下放到农村的干部分布在二十九个比较落后的生产队，这些队经过下放干部的努力，并深入发动群众，现在已有二十二个生产队跃进为先进队，有七个落后队也改变了面貌。各级干部广泛种试验田，工厂企业的干部实行跟班劳动制度以后，已大大改变了领导作风，克服了官僚主义和主观主义，推动了工作和生产。凤阳县李武乡乡干部在自己试验田发现麦锈病，立即组织社、队干部研究，学习技术，进行防治，不到五天时间，全乡就消灭了麦锈病。下放参加劳动的干部还积极帮助农村建立了各种学校，进行扫盲等文教工作，并积极领导群众进行技术改革。蚌埠专区下放干部同群众一道研究创造和改良工具，仅上半年不完全统计，发明创造和改良的工具以及试制成功的新产品，就有八十八件。
    第三，密切了党和群众的关系。广大人民群众真正体会到干部是为他们办事的，因而对党和政府更加热爱了。他们说：“你们和我们一样辛苦，为的是我们过好日子，只有共产党领导下的干部才能这样。”许多干部被群众选为生产模范，如共青团省委下放到宿县符离乡的十四个干部就有四个人被评为全县的先进生产者，这个小组也被评为红旗组。有许多下放干部还被选为党代表和人民代表。
    第四，直接为国家创造了财富，给社会主义建设贡献了物质力量。仅据财贸系统今年4月份统计，去年和今年下放的干部有三万九千多人，其中去年下放的干部有九千多人，生产总值达三亿九千五百多万元；今年下放的干部三万多人，计划生产产值九亿九千七百万元。蚌埠专区有三万六千多干部种试验田，共种试验田二万八千亩，全年可收粮食一亿斤左右。
    现在，全省各地干部参加劳动锻炼已经形成风气。特别是自从大规模炼铁炼钢以来，各地干部正在钢铁战线上日日夜夜忘我地苦战，干部参加劳动已进入新的高潮。（附图片）
