Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 9th: The autumn agricultural collaboration conference held in Nanjing from October 27th to November 5th by six provinces and cities—Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Shanghai—arranged the production plan for next year, striving for a greater leap forward in agricultural production. The conference also discussed the main issues of running rural people's communes well at present. Liao Luyan, Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Minister of Agriculture, attended the conference. Representatives from Shandong Province also attended.

This year, the six provinces and cities have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests in various crops. Total grain output has increased by nearly one and a half times compared to last year, and per-mu yield has increased by 80%. Total cotton output has also increased by nearly one and a half times compared to last year, and per-mu yield is equal to two and a half times last year. The output of peanuts, rapeseed, and other economic crops has also increased significantly compared to last year. The conference believes that the production of oil crops, hemp, and other economic crops this year is far from meeting the needs of socialist construction. It requires that next year, while ensuring a greater leap forward in total grain output, the greatest efforts must be made to develop oil crops, hemp, silk, tea, and other economic crops, appropriately expand the area of economic crops, and develop diversified economies. At the same time, it is also necessary to vigorously develop large livestock and increase pig and sheep production. The conference believes that next year, with the reduction of grain crop planting area, the reduction of sweet potato planting area, and the greater leap forward in total grain output, the task of agricultural production will be particularly arduous. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the command of political and ideological work, and through the communist education movement to be carried out in rural areas this winter and next spring, further mobilize the masses, constantly resolve the contradictions between advanced and conservative thinking, uproot white flags, and plant red flags. This is the key to ensuring the high-speed increase in agricultural production. In terms of increasing production measures, we must conscientiously implement the "eight-point charter of agriculture": water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, close planting, pest control (disease and pest control), tools (improvement of tools), and management (field management). This winter and next spring, we must carry out large-scale farmland water conservancy construction, launch mass movements for accumulating and creating fertilizers, deep plowing of land, and set off a large-scale mass movement of agricultural technology revolution. The conference also called for using the "accurate, ruthless, and mass character" spirit of eliminating the four pests to launch a movement to completely eliminate crop diseases and insect pests starting this winter.

The conference conducted a detailed discussion on carrying out the high-yield demonstration plot movement on a large scale next year and promoting the policy of "plant less, yield more, and reap more." The six provinces and cities decided to designate 10%, 20%, or even 30% (Fujian plans 50%) of the planting area as high-yield demonstration plots. Farmland will be divided into three types: first, satellite experimental fields; second, high-yield demonstration plots; and third, general fields. Satellite fields are the leaders, high-yield demonstration plots are the backbone, driving the general fields to develop towards high yield. All three must be closely grasped and not relaxed or abandoned, and the central link is the high-yield demonstration plot. The conference believes that the implementation of this policy must be carried out step by step in accordance with the specific conditions of each region. At present, we must first focus on next year's summer harvest and early rice, so the area of autumn sowing this year and spring sowing next year should not be reduced too much.

Regarding the consolidation and improvement of people's communes, the conference discussed how to grasp ideology, grasp production, grasp distribution, grasp living welfare, and strengthen party leadership. To consolidate and improve people's communes, the party's leadership must be greatly strengthened and must not be weakened. The conference believes that the practice of some places sending strong county-level leading cadres to people's communes to serve as leading backbones is very good and should be promoted everywhere. Regarding the issue of distribution, the conference believes that rural people's communes, when dealing with distribution issues, should consider the distribution of the entire social product and should be conducive to the development of production throughout society. Therefore, the conference requires all localities to properly handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption—the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, the relationship between the large collective and the small collective, the relationship between expanded reproduction and improving the living standards of members, the relationship between long-term interests and current interests, and also consider the supply of means of production and means of subsistence. In order to develop production and increase income, all expenditures of the people's communes must adhere to the principle of running the commune diligently and frugally, and running all undertakings diligently and frugally. It is necessary to practice strict economy and oppose any form of extravagance and waste. The conference believes that military organization, combat-ready action, and collectivized life have played a great role in production and must be further consolidated. At the same time, it is also necessary to promote democratic management, promote the style of the mass line, and strive to prevent tendencies toward simplification, bureaucracy, formalism, and commandism.

    两大农业协作会议部署明年大面积丰产
    少种　高产　多收
    据新华社南京9日电　江苏、浙江、安徽、福建、江西、上海六省市从10月27日到11月5日在南京举行的秋季农业协作会议，安排了明年的生产规划，力争明年农业生产更大跃进。会议并讨论了当前办好农村人民公社的主要问题。中共中央农村工作部副部长、农业部部长廖鲁言出席了会议。山东省也有代表列席。
    今年六省市各项作物空前大丰收。粮食总产量比去年增加近一倍半，亩产量比去年增长80％。棉花总产量也比去年增加近一倍半，亩产量等于去年两倍半。花生、油菜籽和其它经济作物的产量都比去年有很大增长。会议认为今年油料、麻类等经济作物的生产，还远不能满足社会主义建设的需要，要求明年在保证完成粮食总产量更大跃进的同时，必须用最大的努力发展油料、麻类、蚕丝、茶叶等经济作物，适当扩大经济作物的面积，发展多种经济。同时，还必须大力发展大家畜和增加猪羊生产。会议认为：明年在粮食作物播种面积减少、红薯种植面积缩小，而粮食总产量又要更大跃进的情况下，农业生产任务就显得格外繁重。因此，必须继续加强政治思想挂帅，并通过今冬明春在农村中开展共产主义教育运动，进一步发动群众，不断解决先进与保守思想之间的矛盾，拔白旗，插红旗，这是保证实现农业生产高速度增产的关键。在增产措施上，必须认真贯彻水、肥、土、种、密、害（除治病虫害）、工（改良工具）、管（田间管理）等农业“宪法”。今冬明春要大搞农田水利建设，开展群众性的积肥造肥、深翻土地运动和掀起一个大规模的群众性的农业技术革命高潮。会议还要求用除四害的“准、狠、群众性”的精神，从今冬开始掀起一个彻底消灭农作物病虫害的运动。
    会议对明年开展大面积高额丰产田运动和推行“少种、高产、多收”方针，作了详细讨论。六省市决定以播种面积的10％、20％以至30％（福建计划50％）为高额丰产田。将农田分为三种：一是卫星试验田，二是高额丰产田，三是一般田。卫星田是带头的，高额丰产田是骨干，带动一般田向高产发展，三者都要紧紧抓住，不可放松和偏废，中心环节是高额丰产田。会议认为实行这个方针必须根据各地区的具体情况，有步骤地进行。当前，首先要抓住明年的夏收和早稻，因此今年秋种和明年春种的面积不宜多减。
    关于巩固和提高人民公社的问题，会议讨论了如何抓思想、抓生产、抓分配、抓生活福利和加强党的领导问题。要巩固和提高人民公社，党的领导必须极大地加强，决不能削弱。会议认为有些地方把强的县级领导干部下放到人民公社充任领导骨干的做法很好，各地都应推行。关于分配问题，会议认为农村人民公社在处理分配问题时，要考虑整个社会产品的分配，要有利于全社会生产的发展。因此会议要求各地妥善处理积累与消费的关系——国家、集体、个人的关系，大集体与小集体的关系，扩大再生产与提高社员生活水平的关系，长远利益与目前利益的关系，还要考虑到生产资料和生活资料的供应问题。为了发展生产，增加收入，人民公社的各项开支必须坚持贯彻勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的原则，必须厉行节约，反对任何形式的铺张浪费。会议认为组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化在生产上发挥了极大作用，必须更加巩固起来；同时，又必须发扬管理民主化，发扬群众路线的作风，极力防止简单化、官僚主义、形式主义和命令主义的倾向。
