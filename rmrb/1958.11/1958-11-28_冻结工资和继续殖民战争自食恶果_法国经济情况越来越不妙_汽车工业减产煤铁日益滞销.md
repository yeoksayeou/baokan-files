Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 25th: Reporter Yang Xiaonong reports: The French economic newspaper "Echo" today expressed great concern about the decline of the French automobile industry. The automobile industry is a major industry in France, and played a major role in France's economic development from 1954 to 1957. About 200,000 workers are directly engaged in automobile manufacturing, with an annual total wage bill of 110 billion francs. If indirect employees are included, the number reaches 700,000.

　　"Echo" admits that the decline of the automobile industry involves a wide range of areas. Except for three types of inexpensive cars, almost all cars are affected, such as the Panhard car factory's Dyna brand car, which has reduced production by one-half.

    Why is the French automobile industry declining? According to the analysis in the November issue of the monthly "Economy and Politics", about 70% of French cars are sold in the domestic market, but the capacity of this market is now relatively saturated. Now, domestic car orders in France have decreased, and it is estimated that the automobile industry will inevitably reduce production in the coming months.

    What is serious at present is that not only the automobile industry has experienced a crisis, but the prospects for other important industrial sectors are not promising either. "Economy and Politics" monthly pointed out that coal inventories are constantly increasing. In the three major coal regions of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, the Lorraine Basin, and the Loire, coal stocks have reached 3.4 million tons. "Liberated Parisian" estimates that the year-end coal storage of the "European Coal and Steel Community" will reach 23.5 million tons, of which French coal will reach 7 million tons. Coal mine owners are already considering taking measures, including closing several mines, to reduce production.

    The situation in the metallurgical industry sector is also very serious. As of the end of October, the production of rolled iron industry has exceeded the order quantity by 30%.

    Some industrial sectors have already reduced working hours, or are about to do so. The textile industry has decided to generally reduce working hours by 30% because monthly orders are only enough for fifteen working days.

    Observers here, when analyzing the difficulties currently encountered by the French economy, pointed out that the French ruling class tries to make up for the huge war expenses of the Algerian War and maintain budgetary expenditures by compressing civilian investment, freezing wages, and reducing domestic consumption, but in the end, it harms itself. Because this policy reduces people's purchasing power, thereby accelerating the approach of a cyclical crisis of overproduction.

### 冻结工资和继续殖民战争自食恶果  法国经济情况越来越不妙  汽车工业减产煤铁日益滞销

    冻结工资和继续殖民战争自食恶果
    法国经济情况越来越不妙
    汽车工业减产煤铁日益滞销
    据新华社巴黎25日电　记者杨效农报道：法国经济界报纸“回声报”今天对法国汽车工业的衰退表示了极大的不安。汽车工业是法国的主要工业，在法国1954年到1957年的经济发展中起了主要作用。直接从事汽车制造的职工约达二十万人，每年支付工资总额达一千一百亿法郎。如果包括间接从业人员在内，则达七十万人。
      “回声报”承认，这次汽车工业的衰退涉及的面很广，除三种廉价汽车外，几乎所有汽车均被波及，如帕纳尔汽车厂的杜那牌汽车即减产二分之一。
    法国汽车工业为什么衰退呢？据“经济与政治”月刊11月号分析，法国汽车约有70％销售于国内市场，但是目前这个市场的容量已经处于相对的饱和状态。现在，法国国内的汽车订货已经减少，估计在今后几个月内，汽车工业必然要降低生产。
    目前严重的是：不仅汽车工业出现了危机，其他一些重要工业部门的前景也并不美妙。“经济与政治”月刊指出，煤的存贮量在不断增加。在诺尔—加来海峡、洛林盆地及卢瓦等三大煤区，存煤量已经达到三百四十万吨。“解放了的巴黎人报”估计，年底“欧洲煤钢联营”存煤量将达二千三百五十万吨，其中法国煤将达七百万吨。煤矿主已在考虑采取包括关闭若干矿井在内的一些措施来减少产量。
    冶金工业部门的情况也很严重。截至10月底为止，辗铁工业的生产已经超过订货量的30％。
    一些工业部门目前已经减少开工时间，或者即将这样做。纺织业由于每月订货只够十五个工作日，已经决定普遍减缩工时30％。
    这里的观察家在分析法国经济目前所碰到的困难时指出，法国统治阶级以压缩民用投资，冻结工资，减少国内消费来弥补阿尔及利亚战争的庞大战费和维持预算开支，到头来却使自己受害。因为，这种政策使人民购买力下降。从而加速了周期性生产过剩危机的逼近。
