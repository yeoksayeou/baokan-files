Xinhua News Agency, London. The British "Daily Worker" recently pointed out that the industrial profit figures for the first ten months of 1958 show how the Conservative government's policies favor profits over wages.

The newspaper cited the "Financial Times" survey of the profits obtained by 2,338 industrial companies, pointing out that the profits obtained by these companies increased by more than £99 million over 1957, reaching a record high of more than £1.901 billion.

The "Daily Worker" said that the government's published figures for the first nine months of 1958 showed that there were five million fewer workers receiving wage increases than in the same period last year. The amount of wage increases received by workers each week was £3 million less than in the same period in 1957.

    保守党政府劫贫济富
    英国资本家利润增加
    据新华社伦敦讯　据英国“工人日报”最近指出，1958年头十个月工业利润的数字表明，保守党政府的政策是如何有利于利润而不利于工资。
    报纸援引“金融时报”对二千三百三十八家工业公司所获得的利润的调查材料，指出这些公司获得的利润比1957年增加了九千九百万英镑以上，达到了十九亿零一百万英镑以上的最高纪录。
    “工人日报”说，政府公布的1958年头九个月的数字表明，增加工资的工人比去年同一时期要少五百万。工人增加的工资数额每星期要比1957年同期少三百万英镑。
