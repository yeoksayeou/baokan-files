Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd: Guangdong Province, in the 24 hours of November 1st, refined 877,612 tons of pig iron, exceeding the province's task for the entire year in a single day. Of this, first and second-class iron accounted for 99%. On the same day, the province produced 5,810 tons of steel, more than four times the highest previous daily steel production in the province.

The person in charge of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee told reporters regarding this high-yield achievement: Guangdong Province's annual pig iron production task for this year was 500,000 to 600,000 tons. Due to the extremely weak iron and steel foundation and a constant shortage of coal, the Provincial Committee started focusing on iron and steel later, so pig iron production progressed slowly. From the beginning of the year to the end of September, only 21,100 tons of pig iron were produced. From late September onwards, although the Provincial Committee and Party committees at all levels vigorously grasped iron and steel, progress was still not fast due to a lack of experience and many difficulties. In October, only 59,865 tons of iron were produced, still far from the annual pig iron target. The refining of more than 870,000 tons of pig iron on November 1st shows that Guangdong Province's exploration stage of iron smelting has basically ended, and the laws of iron smelting have been basically mastered by the Party and the broad masses of the people. With this, we can now command nature to produce iron.

According to reports from reporters dispatched to the scene by this agency, iron smelting production in Guangdong Province on November 1st formed a mass movement that was far more enthusiastic, intense, and concentrated than agricultural production in the past. On this day, more than seven million farmers, workers, cadres, People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers, and students participated in iron smelting. Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangdong, and the iron and steel divisions and regiments organized by provincial and special district cadres, all fearlessly took on the most arduous tasks such as blasting and splitting mountains.

The great victory of Guangdong Province's high pig iron yield on November 1st is a victory of indigenous methods and methods for the poor. On this day, in addition to more than 20,000 large and small blast furnaces put into production in Guangdong Province, there were also 92,659 large and small adobe furnaces, and 48,307 various brick, tile, lime, cement, and ceramic kilns. In addition, there were 10,298 iron smelting furnaces that were successfully converted from former bunkers and old houses. (Attached picture)

### 一年任务一天完成  一类和二类铁占百分之九十九  广东日产生铁87万吨

    一年任务一天完成
    一类和二类铁占百分之九十九
    广东日产生铁87万吨
    据新华社广州3日电　广东省在11月1日的二十四小时内，全省人民炼出生铁八十七万七千六百十二吨，一天的产量就超额完成了全省今年的任务。其中一二类铁占99％。在同一天里，全省产钢五千八百一十吨，比过去全省钢的最高日产量增长了四倍多。
    中共广东省委负责人，就这一高产成就对记者说：广东省今年全年生铁生产任务为五十万吨到六十万吨。由于钢铁基础十分薄弱，一向缺煤，省委抓钢铁晚些，因此生铁生产进度缓慢，从年初到9月底才生产了生铁二万一千一百多吨。9月下旬起，省委和各级党委虽然大力抓了钢铁，但是经验少，困难多，进展仍然不快。10月份一个月才产铁五万九千八百六十五吨，距离全年生铁任务指标还很遥远。11月1日炼出生铁八十七万多吨，这一成就说明广东省炼铁的摸索阶段已经基本结束，炼铁的规律已基本上被党和广大人民所掌握。有了这一条，今后就可以命令自然界拿出铁来。
    据本社派往现场的记者报道，11月1日广东省各地的炼铁生产，形成了远较过去农业生产更热烈更紧张更集中的群众运动。在这一天中参加炼铁的农民、工人、干部、解放军官兵、学生，达到七百万人以上。驻广东人民解放军部队官兵，省、专区干部组织的钢铁师团，更是个个奋不顾身，担任了爆炸劈山等最繁重的工作。
    11月1日广东省生铁高产的伟大胜利，是土办法和穷办法的胜利。广东省这天除了投入生产的大小高炉两万多个外，还有大、小土坯炉九万二千六百五十九座，各种砖瓦窑、石灰窑、水泥窑、陶瓷窑四万八千三百零七座。此外还有一万零二百九十八座炼铁炉，是用以前的碉堡、旧房子等改建成功的。（附图片）
