	Is Distant Water Really No Use for Quenching Immediate Thirst?
	Xiao Min

	When something doesn't produce immediate results, people often compare it to "distant water being no use for quenching immediate thirst." Currently, there's a similar argument regarding factories running schools, claiming it doesn't contribute to current production.

	Is this really the case? Not at all. Ruan Chengpu, a technician at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, after learning some physics in the plant's secondary technical school, combined his studies with his production experience and created a non-stop mechanical device, increasing the national production of thin plates by 420 tons throughout the year. Such examples are numerous. Many workers have practical production experience, and once they grasp cultural and scientific knowledge, they can immediately apply it to production, making a significant impact. Workers participating in learning isn't "distant water being no use for quenching immediate thirst," but rather, it's immediately effective.

	Those who argue that "distant water is no use for quenching immediate thirst" say that factories are under production pressure, with insufficient labor and technical strength. If schools are established, with some employees participating in learning, production and work hours will be reduced, affecting production. Admittedly, factories have heavy production tasks, and there's a time conflict between production and learning. However, this is only one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, if factories establish schools, and after three, five, or even ten years, most or all workers participate in learning, and their cultural level rises from illiterate or primary school to middle school, from middle school to high school or university, and a large number of educated laborers are cultivated from the existing workers, then the temporary tension will bring immense benefits in the future. Conversely, if we only treat the symptoms without addressing the root cause, only care about the present without a long-term plan, and workers lack learning opportunities, and their cultural and technical levels don't improve, then production will remain tense now and in the future. Wouldn't that mean that this "immediate thirst" can never be quenched?

	There's another layer. Material products are produced by people, and the quantity and quality of products depend on people, on their communist consciousness and cultural and technical level. The higher the workers' consciousness and the more cultural knowledge and advanced technology they possess, the more and better material products they can produce. Strengthening workers' education and actively improving their cultural and scientific knowledge are essential factors for increasing production. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "While factories produce material products such as steel, machinery, and electricity, they should also be responsible for cultivating new people with cultural knowledge and labor skills – builders of communism. Factories should produce university students, technicians, engineers, and cadres."

	Far and near are relative terms, judged by comparison. Some things seem distant from the current perspective, but are actually quite near from a long-term perspective. This is the case with factories running schools. Currently, our country is transitioning from socialism to communism. One of the conditions for entering communist society is that the entire population must receive education, both widespread and advanced, so that the difference between mental and manual labor is eliminated. Factories running schools is a major step towards popularizing education among the working masses, raising their cultural level, making workers knowledgeable, and gradually eliminating the opposition between manual and mental labor. Therefore, factories running schools are not only for the needs of current production, but also, only in this way can people transition to communism. Those who argue that "distant water is no use for quenching immediate thirst" have neither recognized the key to the plant's leap forward, nor recognized the importance of greatly improving human cultural levels for moving towards communism.

	The conditions for factories running schools are very favorable, the question is what attitude the factory and mine leading cadres take towards running schools. At the beginning of running schools, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China first convened factory and mine party committee secretaries and propaganda cadres to hold a discussion to solve ideological problems. Once the ideological problem was resolved, schools of various forms developed like a whirlwind. We hope that other regions can also, like Taiyuan, focus on the issue of factories running schools, clear ideological obstacles, and make a great leap forward in factories running schools.

    真是远水不解近渴吗？
    萧敏
    一件事情不能马上生立竿见影之效，人们往往把它比之为“远水不解近渴”。现在，在工厂办学问题上也有这种说法，认为工厂办学对于当前的生产无补于事。
    真的是这样吗？不然。太原钢铁厂技工阮成普在本厂中等专业学校里学习一些物理知识以后，他便结合自己的生产经验，创造了一种不停车的机械设备，全年为国家增产薄板四百二十吨。这种例子很多。许多工人都有实际的生产经验，他们一旦掌握文化科学知识，马上就能用之生产，对生产发生作用。工人参加学习不是“远水不解近渴”，而是立即生效。
    “远水不解近渴”论者，持有这样一种理由，说工厂生产紧张，劳动力技术力量不足，如果再办起学校，一部分职工参加学习，就要减少生产和工作时间，会影响生产。诚然，工厂的生产任务很重，生产和学习在时间上有一定的矛盾。但这是问题的一方面，另一方面，工厂办起了学校，经过三年、五年乃至十几年以后，如果工厂的大多数或全部工人都参加了学习，工人的文化水平由文盲、小学达到中学、由中学达到高中、大学的水平，从现有工人当中培养出大批有文化的劳动者，那么，暂时紧张一下，将来就会有莫大的好处。反之，只是头疼医头、脚疼医脚，只顾眼前，没有长远之计，工人没有学习的机会，文化和技术水平得不到提高，现在生产紧张，将来生产依然紧张，那么，这“近渴”岂不是老解不了吗？
    还有一层。物质产品是由人生产出来的，产品质量的多寡好坏，决定于人，决定于人的共产主义觉悟和文化技术水平，工人的觉悟愈高，工人有了较高的文化素养，掌握了先进的技术，才能生产出更多更好的物质产品。加强工人的教育，积极的提高工人的文化科学知识，乃是增产的不可少的因素。刘少奇同志说过：“工厂在生产钢铁、机器、电力等等物质产品的同时，还应该负责培养有文化知识有劳动本领的新人——共产主义的建设者。工厂里应该出大学生、出技师、出工程师、出干部。”
    远和近是比较着说的，是相对的。有些事情，从当前着眼是较远的事情，但如果从长远着眼又是较近的事情。工厂办学就是如此。现在，我国正由社会主义向共产主义过渡。要进入共产主义社会，条件之一就是要全民受教育，既要普及又要提高，使脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别消灭。工厂办学校，正是为了在工人群众中普及教育，提高工人的文化水平，使工人知识化，逐步消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动对立的重大步骤。因此，工厂办学校一方面为了当前的生产需要，同时，也只有这样，人们才能过渡到共产主义。“远水不解近渴”论者，既没有认识到本厂跃进的关键，又没有认识到大大提高人类文化水平对向共产主义迈进的重要意义。
    工厂办学的条件是很优越的，问题在于厂矿领导干部对办学采取何种态度。中共太原市委会在办学之初，首先召集厂矿党委书记和宣传干部务虚，解决思想问题。思想问题已破，各种形式的学校便风起云涌般的发展起来。我们希望其他地区也能像太原一样，抓一抓工厂办学问题，扫除思想障碍，使工厂办学也来一个大跃进。
