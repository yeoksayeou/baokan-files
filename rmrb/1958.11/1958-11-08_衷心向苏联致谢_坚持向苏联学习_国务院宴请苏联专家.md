Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: The State Council held a banquet at noon today to entertain the heads of Soviet economic and cultural experts who are helping our country in its socialist construction, celebrating the 41st anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

At the banquet, which was filled with friendship and joy, Vice Premier Bo Yibo and responsible persons from relevant departments of the State Council, along with Soviet expert leaders Fumin, Totmakov, and their assistants, repeatedly raised their glasses to warmly congratulate each other on the growing prosperity and strength of the new world opened up by the October Socialist Revolution, to congratulate the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union for its rock-solid unity, and to congratulate the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people that will last forever.

In his speech, Bo Yibo spoke eloquently about the great historical significance of the October Revolution and enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people in building communism.

On behalf of the State Council of our country, Bo Yibo expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government and people, and the Soviet experts working in China. He said: In our socialist construction, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people have provided great selfless assistance and have sent many outstanding experts to our country to help with our work. The achievements of our socialist construction are inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union and the creative labor of the Soviet experts. The Chinese people will forever remember the fraternal friendly assistance of the Soviet people and the selfless labor and internationalist spirit of the Soviet experts. Bo Yibo enthusiastically stated that the Chinese people will continue to learn from the Soviet Union, humbly learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and advanced science and technology, to promote the faster development of our socialist construction.

In his speech, Bo Yibo expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and people for their deep sympathy and support in the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression.

Bo Yibo concluded by saying: In the lofty cause of maintaining world peace and human progress, the Chinese people will resolutely and forever stand on the same front as the Soviet people.

Soviet expert leader Fumin said in his speech: The ideals of the October Revolution and the ideas of peace and friendship among the peoples of all countries are fully reflected in the big family of the socialist camp. The formation of a powerful socialist camp is a great achievement of the international communist movement and the workers' movement.

Fumin said: The people of China and the Soviet Union have established an unbreakable friendship, and we help and cooperate with each other like brothers. Our relationship is very sincere because our friendship is built on the common foundation of Marxism-Leninism.

Fumin said in a very excited tone that the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have made tremendous achievements in industry, agriculture, and other fields, and the Soviet people are happy for your achievements. Your achievements are the achievements of the socialist camp, and this achievement has greatly strengthened the unity and power of the socialist camp. Fumin also stated in his speech that the Soviet people will always give firm support to the Chinese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism's provocations in the Taiwan Strait.

Totmakov then spoke with great enthusiasm. He said that the Chinese people are peace-loving and hard-working, and the Chinese and Soviet people will always be united together, which is an invincible force. In order to support the socialist construction of the fraternal Chinese people, all Soviet experts and the Soviet people are always willing to contribute everything they have.

The people attending the banquet repeatedly responded to the speeches of Bo Yibo, Fumin, and Totmakov with warm applause.

In the banquet filled with a friendly atmosphere, State Council Secretary-General Xi Zhongxun and responsible persons from relevant departments of the State Council, including Lin Feng, Wang Shoudao, Liao Chengzhi, Jia Tuofu, and Fan Changjiang, frequently toasted each other with Antonov, Sudarikov, Androsov, and others, the counselors of the Soviet Embassy in China who were invited to attend the banquet, to congratulate the growing consolidation of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and to congratulate the two countries on their leaping forward in the cause of socialist and communist construction.

After the banquet, a group of famous athletes from our country gave a wonderful friendly table tennis and volleyball performance to the Soviet friends.

In the past few days, the economic and cultural departments of the central state organs where Soviet experts and experts from other fraternal countries are helping with their work have also held get-togethers and celebration banquets to celebrate the October Revolution Day with the experts from their respective departments.
