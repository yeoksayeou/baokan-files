    Forty Years Old Furnace Red Flag Flying
    Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant No. 1 Youth Blast Furnace Zhang Yupu
    Our blast furnace is named "Youth Furnace" not because the furnace is young, but because the people operating the furnace are all young men. The youngest among us is only half the age of the furnace. But now the furnace's output has increased three or four times compared to its younger days. Especially after March of this year, we revised the production increase target eight times, and the furnace output has increased from the initial 9,000 tons to 70,000 tons, making our plant the national champion for six consecutive months. Why can such an old and outdated furnace create a miraculous achievement in the hands of inexperienced young lads?
    This furnace was built in 1915 and is a simple and backward furnace. According to the original planned targets, it could only produce 250 tons of iron per day, and the highest daily output never reached 200 tons. What about before liberation? Not only did it not produce iron, the chimney became the home of crows, and several feet of grass grew on the furnace.
    After liberation, this furnace was put back into production and named "Youth Furnace," but accidents occurred frequently, and the production tasks were not completed well. Some people lost confidence and said, "The furnace has been in use for more than forty years, it's too old, how can it work?" Some workers complained to the technicians, "You've read so many books, but you can't even manage the furnace. You're just eating for nothing."
    At the beginning of 1958, the Party Central Committee put forward the slogan of catching up with Britain in fifteen years, which gave us great encouragement. At this time, the Party Committee pointed out: the Youth Furnace must be liberated from the shackles of old ideas, change the passive situation of the furnace managing people, and actively be a good manager of the furnace.... From then on, we found the direction of progress and enhanced our confidence, which is: only by liberating our minds and breaking superstitions can we reverse the backward situation. Through great debate, we unanimously agreed that although the furnace is old, it is entirely possible to increase the coke load while increasing the smelting intensity. And we stipulated the following principles: if ideas are not consistent, debate; if you don't believe it, look; if you are unified, experiment; if you are confident, do it. Our battle slogan is: bring out the spirit of arduous struggle of the 25,000-li Long March, bring out the wisdom of Zhuge Liang, and the courage of Wu Song fighting the tiger, work hard, struggle hard, and work fiercely to increase the smelting intensity from 1.06 to 1.1, reduce the furnace capacity utilization coefficient from 0.71 to below 0.58, increase the coke load from 2.75 to 2.85, work hard for 30 days to increase the hot blast temperature from 700 degrees to 900 degrees, and proposed to increase the original planned production increase target of 900 tons to 1,500 tons. This plan was opposed and hindered by the technical assistant, who said, "What you are doing violates the system, and the regulations do not allow such operations." Some people said, "It is impossible to increase the smelting intensity of this old furnace, it will damage the furnace." What should we do at this critical moment? Should we yield to the conservatives? Or should we persist? With the help of Party and Youth League organizations, we realized that this was a struggle between two lines. If we retreated, we would be surrendering to the backward conservatives. Therefore, we mustered our courage, and on the one hand, we launched a fierce attack on conservatism in the form of big-character posters, and on the other hand, we collected technical data from all aspects to prove that our point of view was correct. Finally, with the support of the Party and Youth League organizations, we won the victory and realized our desire to experiment. But no one expected that two accidents of burning the furnace belly water tank occurred during the experiment, and the inlet and outlet water temperatures of the furnace hearth water tank also increased. We launched a mass campaign to offer suggestions, giving play to the creative wisdom of the masses, and quickly overcame the difficulties in the advance. After eight days of experiments and fourteen days of hard work, we fully realized our battle slogan, increasing the daily output from 460 tons to 590 tons, creating the highest record of furnace utilization coefficient in the history of the entire plant, leading the entire plant. This initiative greatly enhanced the fighting spirit of the Youth Furnace members.
    In order to catch up with the advanced level of the whole country, we carried out a seven-comparison competition between shifts and individuals on this basis, and boldly tried and put forward the battle slogan of "Learn from Anshan, catch up with Anshan." After many fierce "tug-of-war battles," we finally surpassed Anshan Iron and Steel with the highest utilization coefficient of 0.531. But soon our championship was taken away by the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Youth Furnace with a new record, and we put forward the slogan of "Learn from Taiyuan Iron and Steel, catch up with Taiyuan Iron and Steel," and rose up to catch up, and soon won the championship with 0.501, leading the country. We completed the first half of the year's production plan eighteen days ahead of schedule, increasing the production of pig iron by 15,000 tons for the country, saving 4,500 tons of coke, and from then on, we were considered one of the best blast furnaces in the country by all parties.
    We are not satisfied with this, our achievements are still far from the requirements of the Party and the country, and all comrades of our Youth Furnace must continue to work hard, struggle hard, and work skillfully to strive for greater achievements.

    四十年的老炉红旗飘
    本溪第一钢铁厂一号青年高炉　张玉璞
    我们的高炉所以被命名为“青年炉”，并不是因为炉子年轻，是我们操作高炉的都是小伙子。我们当中年龄最小的同志才只有炉子岁数的一半。但是现在炉子的产量却比它年轻时增加了三、四倍。特别是今年3月份之后，我们八次修改增产指标，炉子产量已由最初九千吨提高到七万吨，使我们厂连续六个月荣获全国冠军。为什么这样老而陈旧的高炉，掌握在缺乏经验的青年小伙子手里能创造出神话般的奇迹呢？
    这个炉子是1915年建起来的一座设备简单而落后的炉子。按原计划指标，它一天只能生产二百五十吨铁，最高的日产量从来也没有达到二百吨。解放前呢？不仅不出铁，烟筒成了乌鸦的老家，炉上也长了好几尺高的青草。
    解放以后，这个炉子重新投入生产，并被命名为“青年炉”，可是，经常出事故，生产任务完成的不好。部分人失掉信心，说：“炉子已经使用四十多年了，都老掉牙了，怎么能行呢？”部分工人埋怨技术人员说：“你们白念那么多书啦，连炉子都管不好。真是白吃饱”。
    1958年初，党中央提出了十五年赶上英国的口号，给了我们极大的鼓舞。这时党委指出：青年炉必须从旧思想的束缚中解放出来，改变炉子管人的被动局面，要主动当好管炉子的人……。从此，我们找到了前进的方向，增强了信心，这就是：只有解放思想，破除迷信，才能扭转落后局面。我们通过大辩论一致认为炉子虽然年岁大，但完全可以在提高冶炼强度的同时，提高焦炭负荷。并规定这样几条原则：思想不一致就辩，不信就看，统一了就试验，有把握就干。我们的战斗口号是：拿出二万五千里长征艰苦奋斗的精神，拿出诸葛亮的智慧，武松打虎的勇气，大干、苦干、猛干，把冶炼强度由一点零六提高到一点一，把炉容利用系数由零点七一降到零点五八以下，焦炭负荷由二点七五提高到二点八五，苦干三十天，使热风温度由七百度提高到九百度，并提出把原计划增产九百吨的指标提高到一千五百吨。这个计划遭到技术助理的反对和百般阻挠，他说：“你们这样做违反制度，规章上不允许这样操作”。有的人则说：“这个老掉牙的炉子还要提高冶炼强度，那是不行的，非搞坏炉子不可”。在这个紧要关头，该怎么办呢？是向保守主义者让步呢？还是坚持下去呢？我们在党团组织的帮助下，认识到这是两条道路的斗争，如果退却就是向落后的保守主义者投降。因此，我们鼓足了勇气，一方面用大字报的形式对保守主义进行了猛烈的攻击，同时也各方面收集技术资料来说明我们的观点是正确的。终于在党团组织的支持下获得了胜利，实现了进行试验的愿望。但谁也没有预料到在试验中竟发生两次烧坏炉腹水箱的事故，另外也使炉缸水箱的进出水温度增大。我们就开展了群众性的献计活动，发挥了群众的创造智慧，迅速地战胜了前进中的困难。经过八天的试验和十四天的苦战，全面地实现了我们的战斗口号，使日产量由四百六十吨提高到五百九十吨，创造了高炉利用系数全厂有史以来的最高纪录，在全厂领先。这一创举大大地提高了青年炉成员的斗志。
    为了赶上全国的先进水平，我们又在此基础上开展了班与班、个人与个人之间的七比竞赛活动，并大胆尝试，提出了“学鞍山，赶鞍山”的战斗口号。经过多次激烈的“拉锯战”，我们终以零点五三一的最高利用系数超过了鞍钢。可是不久又被太钢青年炉以新的纪录夺去了我们的冠军，我们又提出“学太钢，赶太钢”的口号，奋起直追，不久就以零点五零一获得冠军在全国领先。提前十八天完成了上半年生产计划，为国家增产生铁一万五千吨，节约焦炭四千五百吨，从此我们也就被各方面认为是全国最优秀的高炉之一了。
    我们并不因此而满足，我们的成就与党和国家的要求还相差很远，我们青年炉全体同志一定继续苦干、猛干、巧干，争取更大的成就。
