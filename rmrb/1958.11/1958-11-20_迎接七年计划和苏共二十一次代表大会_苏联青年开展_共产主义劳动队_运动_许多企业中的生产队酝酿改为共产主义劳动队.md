Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: Soviet youth, in anticipation of the Seven-Year Plan and the upcoming 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are launching a nationwide "Communist Labor Brigade" movement. This type of labor brigade is a collective organization for labor, study, and life. Each member participating in the labor brigade must not only work in the spirit of communism but also study science, technology, and culture.

    Many factories, mines, and collective farms in Moscow, Leningrad, Magnitogorsk, Baku, Ukraine, and Belarus have already organized Communist Labor Brigades. Judging from the regulations drafted by the labor brigades themselves, these labor brigades are labor collectives filled with the spirit of communism. The regulations of the Communist Labor Brigade of the Fifth and Sixth Mines of the "Red Army Coal Mine" Trust in Donbas stipulate that each member should work with a conscious attitude and should study business, culture, and politics, mastering every procedure of coal mining technology. The Communist Labor Brigade of the No. 12 Blast Furnace of the Dnepropetrovsk Metallurgical Plant not only proposed guarantees such as overfulfilling production plans, but also proposed that each member should master several professions and actively study and participate in social activities. Many enterprise production teams in the Soviet Union are brewing transformation into Communist Labor Brigades. Romanov, a lathe operator and captain of the Leningrad Metallurgical Plant Youth Work Team, stated on behalf of the entire team at a meeting discussing Khrushchev's report on the outline of the Seven-Year Plan that, in order to welcome the convening of the Party Congress, their work team should work more actively and strive to become a Communist Labor Brigade.

    许多企业中的生产队酝酿改为共产主义劳动队
    新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联青年为了迎接七年计划和即将召开的苏共第二十一次党代表大会，正在全国各地开展一个“共产主义劳动队”运动。这种劳动队是劳动、学习和生活的集体组织。参加劳动队的每个队员不但要以共产主义精神劳动，还要学习科学技术和文化。
    莫斯科、列宁格勒、马格尼托哥尔斯克、巴库、乌克兰、白俄罗斯的许多工厂、矿井和农庄都已组织了共产主义劳动队。从劳动队自己订的规章可以看出，这种劳动队是充满着共产主义精神的劳动集体。顿巴斯“红军煤矿”托辣斯第五和第六号矿井的共产主义劳动队的规章提出每个队员都应以自觉的态度进行劳动，都要学习业务、文化和政治，掌握采煤技术的每一个程序。第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克冶金工厂第十二号高炉的共产主义劳动队不但提出超额完成生产计划等保证，同时还提出每个队员要掌握几种职业，要积极学习和参加社会活动。苏联许多企业中的生产队都在酝酿改为共产主义劳动队。列宁格勒冶金工厂青年工作队队长镟工罗马斯诺夫代表全队在讨论赫鲁晓夫关于七年计划提纲报告的会议上表示，为了迎接党代会的召开，他们的工作队要更积极劳动，争取变成共产主义劳动队。
