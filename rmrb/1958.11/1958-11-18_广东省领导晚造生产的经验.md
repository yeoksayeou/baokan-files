Guangdong's early rice production, although achieving a substantial increase of 6.7 billion jin compared to last year's early rice harvest, was not prominent enough amidst the nationwide great leap forward in agricultural production. The Provincial Party Committee consciously utilized this situation, emphasizing it greatly to mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast cadres and masses, enabling them to recognize the situation, boost their morale, and break through the middle level, striving for the top. After continuous hard work, a bumper harvest of late rice is assured, with the estimated total output reaching 35 billion jin, and a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, three to four times that of last year's late rice and nearly three times that of this year's early rice. Including late-season miscellaneous grains and spring-harvested early rice, the total annual output is preliminarily estimated to reach approximately 65 billion jin, with a yield of 1,550 jin per mu, averaging over 1,700 jin of grain per person in the province.

Whether agricultural production can leap forward depends critically on the great emancipation of leaders' and masses' thinking and the extensive mobilization of the broad masses. "Where there is the courage to think, there is the possibility; where there is the courage to act, there is the realization," is the profound understanding of cadres and masses. It is also the most fundamental experience in leading late rice production. Specifically speaking:

  First, Implement the Spirit of Continuous Revolution
      Oppose Right-leaning Conservative Thought

    The leaping forward situation makes people's thinking appear more backward than reality. People do not fully understand the potential of agricultural production, how much wealth can be extracted from nature, and it is easy to become complacent with a little achievement, whereupon fatigue, slackness, right-leaning conservatism all follow. Looking forward, looking left and right, one feels the pressing situation, the necessity to leap forward. We have been continuously talking about the national grain situation, the soaring drive and production targets of various places, to make cadres and masses recognize the situation and dispel arrogance.

    "Condition theory" was quite popular for a considerable time. Cadres in backward areas said: "Few people and much land, high mountains and cold water, backward farming, others can leap forward, we cannot. A small leap forward is possible, a large leap forward is not. Assistance from superiors is possible, self-reliance is not." Condition theory became a shield for right-leaning conservatives, an ideological obstacle to the great leap forward. We launched a criticism of condition theory, making cadres recognize that conditions can be changed, contradictions can be transformed, and a dialectical view is necessary when assessing conditions. "Blank paper can be written with the newest and most beautiful words, painted with the newest and most beautiful pictures." Bad conditions are precisely the motivation for arousing people's enthusiasm, and enthusiasm can create favorable conditions. The criticism of condition theory has played a significant role in changing the face of backward areas and achieving balanced development in production.

    "Middle-level theory" is also a major obstacle. After recognizing the pressing situation of one wave chasing another, most cadres can muster their enthusiasm and strive for the top. But some people have put forward: "The top is not easy to reach, the bottom is undesirable, the middle is the most appropriate," "The top is too stressful to endure, the bottom will be punished, not good, the middle is comfortable and happy." Thus, various places broke through the middle-level theory and launched an ideological movement to denounce the middle-level theory. After debate, as some villagers said: "Woe to the middle level, stink to the middle level, with the middle level no one stands out, break through the middle level without stopping, everyone competes to stand at the top." Middle-level thought is now despised by the masses.

    Agricultural production is a process of continuous struggle between people and nature, a process of people continuously mastering the laws of plant growth. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly overcome various natural disasters, eliminate the mentality of "labor is in people, success is in heaven," intimidated by the power of nature, and establish the courageous and daring style of "how daring people are, how productive the land is, how much labor is paid, how much yield is produced." According to the production season, new tasks are proposed in a tight loop. When cultivating the fields, it was proposed that sufficient water, abundant fertilizer, and thick soil layers are key, water, soil, and fertilizer determine everything. During rice transplanting, we fought against the fallacy of "sparse planting yields grain to sell, dense planting yields grass to burn," emphasizing that dense planting determines everything. After transplanting, we emphasized rational irrigation and drainage, attacking the tillering stage, proposing that the number of tillers determines everything. We organized shock brigades, divided combat zones, and contracted to eliminate third-class seedlings. In the later stage of field management, we proposed protecting the panicles and attacking the grains, the number of grains determines everything, and we must do everything possible to make the panicles uniform and the grains strong. After one battle ended, we immediately organized a second battle.

    Putting politics and ideology in command. Talking about the situation, criticizing "condition theory" and "middle-level theory," constantly proposing new combat tasks, and overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking are the ideological foundations for obtaining a bumper harvest. The late rice bumper harvest is the product of a great ideological harvest.

  Second, Emphasize Dense Planting and Field Management

    The unit area yield is the product of the number of panicles and the number of grains and grain weight. The more panicles and grains, the higher the yield. Therefore, it is necessary to first grasp the number of panicles and, on the basis of a certain number of panicles, simultaneously grasp the number of grains, seeking the number of panicles first, then attacking the number of grains. This year's early rice suffered from not being densely planted enough. This year's late rice, the province's average of 400,000 to 500,000 panicles per mu, several times more than last year's late rice of 100,000+ panicles, and this year's early rice of 150,000-160,000 panicles, is the primary guarantee for increased production of late rice. However, the dense planting of late rice has undergone a struggle. It was only after ideological exchanges that this important technical measure was implemented.

    Past backward farming techniques have formed conservative habits in people. Therefore, the first hurdle of dense planting is to overcome people's sparse planting thinking. Some people said: "Sparse rice, sparse seedlings are suitable, one string of grain spikes requires two people to carry, dense rice, densely packed, a few grains of rice per string." A considerable number of technical cadres also advocated dense planting, but their "dense" was only slightly denser than the past "sparse," not dense enough to fully utilize the land. They said: "Early rice relies on the main panicle, late rice relies on tillering, dense planting is ineffective for tillering, rice stalks are weak and easily fall over." Through thematic debates, we criticized the thinking that sparse planting yields more grain and dense planting is prone to lodging, laying the ideological foundation for rational dense planting. In transplanting, we adopted the mass line method of "demonstration, debate, promotion, and evaluation," that is, on-the-spot instruction, live demonstration, layer-by-layer trial planting, free airing of views and debate, summary promotion, and comprehensive blooming. This solved both specific and ideological problems, enabling the comprehensive implementation of dense planting measures.

    The second hurdle after dense planting is that various measures must keep up. However, due to insufficient preparation, after grabbing dense planting of late rice, there was a serious shortage of seedlings. The amount of seed sown increased from seven or eight jin per mu to dozens of jin. When seed grain ran out, commodity grain was used, and when late rice seeds were used up, early rice seeds were inverted and sown. Deep plowing was not enough, and fertilizer also could not keep up. After dense planting, many third-class seedlings appeared at one point. Some people were pessimistic and discouraged because of this. We criticized the thinking of "emphasizing planting and neglecting management," emphasizing the "victory in the post-natal" theory, and implemented the spirit of human effort is decisive. After realizing that field management has great potential, everyone mustered revolutionary enthusiasm and tightly grasped field management. According to the growth process of rice seedlings, tasks were proposed in segments, and large-scale battles were organized. First, we besieged third-class seedlings. Leaders at all levels went deep into the fields, organized field consultations, prescribed the right medicine, and pointed out that the cause of the third-class seedlings was insufficient fertilizer. Therefore, the center of field management was to accumulate and topdress fertilizer. Farmers in Xinfeng County sang: "Rice seedlings are not divided into three classes, good or bad depends entirely on what people do, enough fertilizer and clean weeds, three become one, less fertilizer, one class becomes three classes," expressing the will of the province's farmers to "win in the post-natal."

  Third, Competition, Evaluation, and Big-Character Posters

    We deeply realized that competition, evaluation, and big-character posters are the best organizational forms, methods, and weapons for leading production movements. A surge of competition has swept across counties, townships, and communes throughout the province. In order to promote this competition and prevent it from becoming a mere formality, the province organized two large-scale, comprehensive, and systematic agricultural production inspections. More than 100,000 cadres and more than 5 million people participated in the inspections. The local prefectural and county party committees also organized three or four inspections and evaluations in their respective areas. The method of inspection and evaluation generally adopted a combination of cursory inspections and in-depth observation, trying to reach every township and every commune, to encourage the masses, but also to delve into key areas to discover problems and summarize experiences. Inspection teams everywhere greatly encouraged cadres and masses. The masses posted big-character posters saying: "Hearing that an inspection team is coming, our drive is stronger and our hearts more focused, 2,000 dan of fertilizer accumulated per mu, three days' task completed in one day." After the inspection team left, it left valuable suggestions. The cadres below said: "Affectionate guidance, meticulous care, leaving valuable words, bearing fruits and flowers."

    Facts have proven that mass on-site evaluation is a method of educating the masses through actual things, grasping both ends, bringing along the middle, analyzing and comparing through the two mutually contradictory aspects, and using advanced methods to overcome backwardness. Therefore, it is a materialistic method, a dialectical method, and a method for the masses to educate themselves. This method has been widely used in late rice production. In organizing competitions and evaluations, we paid special attention to grasping the neighboring areas between special zones, counties, townships, and communes. This not only mobilized the enthusiasm of both sides of the competition but also enabled the rapid change of the faces of these traditionally backward remote areas. There are great benefits to the comprehensive linkage of the two sides of the competition. For example, Lianping and Xinfeng counties in remote mountainous areas held an on-site evaluation meeting at the border area, and the two counties signed a competition agreement. Seven townships in Xinfeng and thirteen townships in Lianping, as well as three key communes in the two counties, were directly linked to establish competition relations. This greatly promoted the two counties' determination to comprehensively leap forward and strive for first place. Before the evaluation, Longjie Township in Lianping County found that more than 100 mu of land in the commune had not been cultivated during the mid-cultivation season, and some of the land had not been transplanted by the beginning of autumn, so it immediately concentrated its efforts to launch a blitz, working hard overnight to complete the task and welcome the evaluation. Thirty-five old men in Matou Commune in Xinfeng County heard that the Provincial Party Committee was coming to preside over the evaluation, and voluntarily asked the commune cadres to let them participate in the battle of Longjie. Farmers in Xinfeng County vividly depicted this enthusiastic competitive situation with mountain songs: "Clouds of war drift from north to south, the earth moves and the mountains shake, and the sun and moon sway, the whole party and the whole people are working hard together, and the heroic figures are watching today. Dare to sing mountain songs loudly, dare to set plans and dare to implement them, guarantee to realize a satellite county, and determined to compete to reach Beijing."

    After the border competition and evaluation movement in various special zones, counties, and townships was launched, the masses were mobilized and secretly sent "envoys" to observe each other. In order to defeat their opponents, the masses overcame all difficulties to implement the decisions of the superiors. The places that participated in the evaluation in Chaoan achieved "uniformization" of transplanting specifications, "gardenization" of field management, and "baldness" of the weeds on the field foundations. The province has formed a situation where communes are vying for red flags, teams are competing for first place, and everyone is striving to be at the top. In the competition and evaluation, the masses seriously studied the opponents' production increase measures and put forward methods to surpass their opponents, showing a high degree of awareness.

    Big-character posters are a powerful weapon for carrying out mass movements. Since May of this year, more than 400 million big-character posters have been posted in rural areas throughout the province. In most areas, a lively and vigorous political situation has formed, showing great power, which has promoted both rectification and consolidation of communes, and has also promoted production. Most cadres have transformed from fearing big-character posters to loving them. Big-character posters have developed from being fixed in one place to big-character posters looking for people, big-character posters coming to the door, and big-character posters coming to the scene in person. From within agricultural cooperatives, it has developed to mutual gifting between townships and communes. Big-character posters are not limited by time, place, or object, and can freely express opinions, debate, and regularly promote democracy to handle internal contradictions of the people. The spearhead of big-character posters sweeps away the three styles and five airs. As a farmer said: "Big-character posters are really good, everyone calls them a magic weapon, right-leaning conservatism is swept away, and the three styles and five airs cannot escape." He criticized a cadre for not going deep enough in a big-character poster: "Branch Secretary Liu Hangiang, meetings are long during busy farming, I suggest you change this in the future, and go deep into the fields to discuss more." He praised the excellent cadres: "Commune Chief Guo Wenaia, works really fast, gets the red flag in the commune, resolutely takes the lead, for the three thousand and eight changes, leads the villagers to work hard again and again."

    Big-character posters were posted to third-class seedlings, and the third-class seedlings were eliminated; big-character posters were posted to farm tools exposed to rain and sun, and the storage of farm tools was improved; they were posted to thin and weak cattle, and the management and care work was improved. In many places, big-character posters were used for thematic debates and free airing of views. Happiness Commune in Sihui County used big-character posters to refute the theory of no fertilizer, praised the good example of the fertilizer accumulation hero, the Mulan Shock Group, criticized the bad example of Wu Xueqi who opposed fertilizer accumulation, seized the opposite side, launched a debate, and made the fertilizer accumulation movement deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, exceeding the fertilizer accumulation task.

    Facts have proven: the more big-character posters there are, the better the production is. Big-character posters really produce grain.

  Fourth, Set Up Camps and Settle Down in the Fields to Plant Large Areas of High-Yield Fields

    The 1 million mu of cadre experimental fields in early rice have become a model of technical reform, a banner of high yield, and a place for cadres to become both red and expert. However, how to increase the yield even higher, do the work more deeply, and spread the experience better has become a problem that cadres are concerned about and want to solve. Pang Jitone, secretary of the Haiiing Island Party Committee in Yangiang County, and Dai Ruxi, secretary of the Shuangfeng Commune Branch, discussed a solution and pioneered the idea of building thatched sheds in the fields, installing telephones, settling down, eating, living, working, and guiding work all here. The Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee quickly promoted this experience. More than 90% of the township party committee members, 84% of the commune committee members, more than 60,000 cadres above the production team leader, and 800,000 commune members lived in the fields, ate in the fields, and worked hard day and night in the fields. The province promoted this experience, and many county party secretaries, county party committee members, and grassroots party committee members built field command posts, ate, lived, and worked in the fields, determined to share the fate of rice seedlings. They expressed their determination: "Building small thatched huts in the fields, taking the fields as home, not wavering, letting the wind blow and the sun shine, pests and diseases cannot harm a single seedling."

    Because of eating and lodging in the fields, the leadership is more specific and in-depth, and the relationship between cadres and masses is also closer. Villagers praised in big-character posters in the fields: "Cadres take the lead in living in the fields, solving problems in every way, cadres and villagers work hard together, striving for a bumper harvest of late rice."

    In many places, cadres have insisted on living in the fields until now, insisting until the rice is in hand. And the fields have also become the activity center of politics, economy, culture, and labor, running field canteens, temporary nurseries, barber shops, and supply and marketing stations. Big-character posters arrive in the fields, and learning culture is also done in the fields.

    There are certain limitations to the promotion of experience in planting small plots of experimental fields. People's desire for increased production requires shortening the distance between the yield of experimental fields and large plots of land, and requiring large areas of high yield. Therefore, many places have developed from small experimental fields of early rice to planting large areas of experimental fields and high-yield plots of late rice, and launched the 10,000 jin and 10,000 mu high-yield plot movement. The field headquarters was set up in the high-yield plot, and the experience created by the high-yield plot was quickly promoted to drive the entire township and county forward. This experience has proven very effective and it was decided to comprehensively promote it next year.

    广东省领导晚造生产的经验
    中共广东省委书记　赵紫阳
    广东的早造粮食生产，虽然获得了比去年早造增产六十七亿斤的大丰收，但在全国农业生产大跃进的形势中，是不够突出的。省委有意识地运用了这种形势，大讲特讲，以调动广大干部和群众的积极性，使干部和群众认清了形势，鼓足了干劲，大破中游、力争上游。经过连续的苦战，晚造的大丰收已成定局，估计晚稻总产量可达三百五十亿斤，单位面积产量一千斤以上，为去年晚造的三、四倍，将近今年早造的三倍。加上晚造杂粮及春收早稻等，全年总产量初步预计可达六百五十亿斤左右，单位面积产量一千五百五十斤，全省每人平均粮食一千七百斤以上。
    农业生产能否跃进，决定的关键在于领导思想和群众思想的大解放，在于广大群众的大发动。“敢想就有可能，敢干就能实现”，这是干部与群众的深切体会。也是领导晚造生产的一条最根本的经验。具体说来是：
  第一、贯彻不断革命精神
      反对右倾保守思想
    跃进的形势，使人们的思想更显得落后于现实。人们对农业生产的潜力，对可以向大自然索取多少财富，并不十分了解，很容易在一点已得的成绩面前自满起来，于是，疲沓松劲，右倾保守，随之俱来。如果向前看，向左右看，就会感到形势迫人，非跃不可。我们是通过不断地讲全国的粮食形势，讲各地的冲天干劲与生产指标，使干部和群众认清形势，打掉骄气的。
    “条件论”在一个时间相当流行，落后地区的干部说：“人少地多，山高水冷，耕作落后，别处跃进可以，这里跃进不能。小跃进可以，大跃进不能。上级支援可以，自力更生不能。”条件论成为右倾保守者的挡箭牌，成为大跃进的思想障碍。我们展开了对条件论的批判，使干部认清条件可以改变，矛盾可以转化，看条件的好坏要有辩证观点，“白纸可以写最新最美的字，画最新最美的画。”坏条件正是鼓起人们干劲的动力，干劲又可以创造出有利的条件。对于条件论的批判在改变落后地区的面貌，使生产平衡发展方面，起了很大的作用。
    “中游论”也是个大障碍。在认清了一浪赶一浪的迫人形势之后，大部分干部是能鼓足干劲，力争上游的。但也有一部分人，提出了：“上游不能当，下游不愿当，中游最妥当”、“上游过分紧张难当，下游要挨处分不好当，中游稳坐快乐舒畅”的论调。于是各地大破中游论，开展了辩臭中游论的思想运动。经过辩论之后，正如一些社员所说：“哀中游，臭中游，有了中游不出头，大破中游不能休，人人相争立上游。”中游思想已为群众所不耻。
    农业生产是人和自然不断斗争的过程，是人们不断掌握植物生长规律的过程。因此，必须不断地战胜各种自然灾害，清除“劳动在人，成功在天”，慑服于自然威力的心理，树立“人有多大的胆，地有多大的产，付出多少劳力，生产多少产量”的敢想敢为风格。根据生产季节，一环紧扣一环地提出新的任务。在办田的时候，提出水足、肥丰、土层厚是关键，水土肥决定一切。在插秧的时候，和主张疏植的“疏禾有谷粜，密禾有草烧”的谬论作斗争，强调密植决定一切。插秧之后，强调合理排灌，攻分蘖关，提出条数决定一切。组织突击队，划分作战区，包干消灭三类禾。田间管理后期，提出保穗攻粒，粒数决定一切，要想尽办法使穗穗齐整，粒粒精壮。在一个战役结束之后，紧接着又组织第二个战役。
    政治思想挂帅。讲形势，批判“条件论”、“中游论”，不断提出新的战斗任务，克服右倾保守思想，是获得丰产的思想基础。晚造大丰收是思想大丰收的产物。
    第二、突出地抓密植和田间管理
    构成单位面积产量的是穗数和粒数粒重的积。穗数粒数越多，产量也就越高。因此必须先抓穗数，并在一定穗数的基础上同时抓粒数，先求穗数，后攻粒数。今年早稻插得不密的吃了亏。今年晚稻，全省每亩平均四、五十万穗，比去年晚造的十多万穗、今年早造的十五、六万穗，增加数倍，这是晚造所以增产的首要保证。但是，晚造的密植，是经过一番斗争的。是经过思想交锋之后，才把这项重要的技术措施贯彻下去的。
    过去落后的耕作技术形成了人们保守的习惯，因此，密植的第一关是克服人们的疏植思想。有些人说：“疏禾疏丁当，一串谷穗两人扛，密禾密的笃，一串谷穗几粒谷。”相当部分的技术干部，也主张密植，但他们的“密”，只是比过去的“疏”稍密而已，并不是密到充分利用土地。他们说：“早田靠主穗，晚田靠分蘖，密植无效分蘖多，稻秆软弱容易倒”。我们通过专题辩论，批判了疏植多谷，密植易倒的思想，为合理密植打下思想基础。在插秧中，采用了“示范、辩论、推广、评比”的群众路线的方法，也就是田头传授，现场示范，层层试插，鸣放辩论，总结推广，全面开花的做法。既解决具体问题，又解决思想问题，使得密植措施得到全面贯彻。
    密植后的第二关是必须使各项措施跟上去。但是，由于原来准备不足，晚稻抓密之后，出现秧苗严重不足的现象，播种量由每亩七、八斤增至数十斤。种子粮用完，用商品粮，晚造种播完，用早造种倒播。深耕不够，肥料也跟不上，密植之后，一度出现不少三类禾。有的人也曾因而悲观泄气。我们批判了“重插轻管”的思想，强调“后天决胜”论，贯彻了事在人为的精神。大家在认识到田间管理大有可为之后，鼓起革命干劲，狠狠地抓紧了田间管理，按照禾苗生长过程，分段提出任务，组织大兵团作战，首先围攻三类禾，各级领导深入田间，组织田头会诊，对症下药，指出三类禾的产生，在于肥料不足，因此田间管理的中心是积肥追肥。新丰县的农民这样歌唱：“禾苗本不分三类，好坏全靠人来为，肥足草净三变一，肥少一类变三类。”表达了全省农民“后天决胜”的意志。第三、竞赛、评比、大字报
    我们深刻体会到竞赛、评比、大字报是领导生产运动的最好的组织形式、方法和武器，全省的县、乡、社之间掀起了竞赛热潮。为了推动这种竞赛，使之不流于形式，全省组织了两次大规模的、全面系统的农业生产大检查。参加检查的有干部十万多人，群众五百多万人，各地委、县委自己又组织了三、四次本地区的检查评比。检查评比的方法，一般是采取走马看花和下马观花相结合，尽可能做到乡乡到，社社到，鼓舞群众，又能深入重点发现问题，总结经验。检查团到处，对干部和群众鼓舞很大，群众贴大字报说：“听说来了检查团，干劲更足心更专，一亩积肥两千担，三日任务一日完。”检查团走了，留下了宝贵的意见，下面干部这样说：“亲切的指导，无微的关怀，留下珍贵语，结出花果来。”
    事实证明，群众性的现场评比，是通过实际事物教育群众的方法，是抓两头，带中间，通过互相矛盾的两个方面，进行分析，比较，用先进克服落后的方法，因此，是唯物的方法，是辩证的方法，是群众自己教育自己的方法。这个方法在晚造生产中已普遍运用。在组织评比竞赛中，我们特别注意抓专、县、乡、社之间的接邻地区，这样不仅最能调动竞赛双方的热情，而且能使这些一向落后的边远地区的面貌迅速改变过来。竞赛的双方做到全面挂钩有很大好处。例如偏僻山区的连平新丰二县，在边界地方开了现场评比大会，两县签订竞赛协议书。新丰的七个乡和连平的十三个乡以及两县的三个重点社，都直接挂钩，建立竞赛关系。这就大大促进了两县全面跃进，力争第一的决心。连平县隆街乡在评比前查出全社有一百多亩田到了中耕季节没有中耕，有一部分田到了立秋没有插秧，便立即集中力量突击，通宵苦战，完成任务，迎接评比。新丰县马头社有三十五个老头听说省委来主持评比，自动向社干部请缨，要求让他们参加大战隆街。新丰农民用山歌生动地描绘了这种热火朝天的竞赛形势说：“天南地北战云飘，地动山移日月摇，全党全民齐苦战，英雄人物看今朝。敢唱山歌敢大声，敢订计划敢实行，保证实现卫星县，决心争上北京城。”
    各专区，各县乡的边界竞赛评比运动开展之后，群众动起来了，都或明或暗地互派“使节”往来观察。为了战胜对手，群众排除万难来贯彻上级的决议。潮安参加评比的地方，都实现了插秧规格“统一化”，田间管理“花园化”，田基草铲得“光头化”。全省形成了社社夺红旗，队队争第一，人人争上游的局面。在竞赛评比中，群众都认真研究对手的增产措施，提出了超过对手的办法，表现了高度的自觉。
    大字报是大搞群众运动的有力武器。从今年5月以来，全省农村贴出了四亿多张大字报，在多数地区已形成生动活泼的政治局面，显示出巨大的威力，既推动了整风整社，也推动了生产。大部分干部，已由怕大字报转变为爱大字报。大字报已由固定一地发展到大字报找人、大字报上门，大字报亲临现场。由农业社内部，发展到乡乡、社社互相赠送。大字报不限时间、地点、对象，能随时鸣放、辩论，经常发扬民主，处理人民的内部矛盾。它矛头所指，扫荡三风五气。正如一个农民说的：“大字报，真正好，人人称它是法宝，右倾保守一扫光，三风五气逃不了。”他批评干部不深入的一张大字报写道：“支部书记刘汉强，农忙开会时间长，建议以后要改过，深入田间多商量。”他表扬了优秀的干部：“社长郭文佳，干事真正快，社内得红旗，坚决把头带，为了三千和八变，领导社员苦战再苦战。”
    大字报贴到三类禾，三类禾消灭了；大字报贴到雨淋日晒的农具，农具保管得好了；贴到瘦弱的耕牛身上，管养工作改善了。很多地方，运用大字报作专题辩论，专题鸣放。四会县的幸福社，运用大字报，驳倒了无肥论，表扬了积肥的好典型花木兰突击组，批判了反对积肥的坏典型伍学琦，抓住了对立面，展开了辩论，使积肥运动深入人心，超额完成了积肥任务。
    事实证明：哪里的大字报越多，哪里的生产也搞的越好，大字报真的出了粮食。
    第四、田头安营扎寨种大面积丰产田
    早造一百万亩干部试验田，成为技术改革的典范，高产的旗帜，干部红专的场所。但是，如何使产量提的更高，工作做的更深入，经验更好的传播，成为干部所关心而要求解决的问题。阳江县海陵岛党委书记庞积通和双丰社支部书记戴如喜，商量出了办法，首创在田头搭上草棚，安装上电话，定居下来，吃住、劳动、指导工作，均在于此。湛江地委迅速推广这个经验，全区有90％以上的乡党委委员，84％的社委委员，生产队长以上的干部六万多人，和八十万社员群众，都住在田头，吃在田头，日夜苦战在田头。全省推广这个经验，很多地方的县委书记、县委委员和基层党委委员，都搭了田头指挥台，食宿劳动在田头，决心要和禾苗同命运共呼吸。他们表示决心说：“田头搭起小茅寮，以田为家不动摇，任凭风吹日头晒，虫害难伤一根苗。”
    由于食宿在田，领导更具体、更深入了，干群关系也更加密切了。社员在田头大字报上表扬说：“干部带头住田头，解决问题件件周，干部社员齐苦干，力争晚造大丰收。”
    不少地方，干部住在田头一直坚持到现在，坚持到稻谷拿到手。而田头，也变成了政治、经济、文化、劳动的活动中心，办田头食堂，办临时托儿所、理发站、供销站。大字报到田，学文化也在田。
    种小块的试验田，经验的推广尚有一定的限制，人们增产的热望要求缩短试验田和大片田产量的距离，要求大面积的丰产。因此，许多地方都由早造的小块试验田，发展到晚造种大面积的试验田、丰产片，开展了万斤万亩丰产片运动。把田头指挥所安扎在丰产片，把丰产片创造的经验迅速加以推广，带动全乡全县前进。这种经验证明非常有效，决定在明年全面推广。
