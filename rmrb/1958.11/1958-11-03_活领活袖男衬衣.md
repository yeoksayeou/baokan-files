    Men's Shirt with Detachable Collar and Cuffs
    The Beijing Public-Private Partnership Dahua Shirt Factory has recently designed a new type of men's shirt with detachable collars and cuffs and has begun mass production to supply the market. This shirt is designed based on the characteristics that collars and cuffs are easily soiled and frequently worn. It comes with two sets of collars and cuffs that can be easily replaced. It is convenient to wash, easier to iron, and more durable than ordinary shirts with fixed collars and cuffs by a factor of two. However, the price is only about 20% higher than ordinary shirts, saving money and conserving cotton cloth.

    活领活袖男衬衣
    北京公私合营大华衬衣厂，新近设计了一种活领活袖男衬衣，并已大批生产，供应市场。这种衬衣是根据领、袖易脏和经常磨损的特点设计的，附带领子、袖子两份，可以随意掉换，洗时方便，平整时省力，耐穿率比一般死领死袖衬衣高一倍，但价格比一般衬衣只高20％左右，既省钱又节约棉布。
