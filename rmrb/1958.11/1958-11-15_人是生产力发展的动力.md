In the development of productivity, people play a decisive role.

In the development of productivity, people play a decisive role.

Zhou Xincheng, a student in the Department of Economics at Renmin University of China, published an article entitled "Some Questions on 'Productivity'" in the tenth issue of "Teaching and Research." He put forward new views on the concept of "productivity." He believes that in the two elements of productivity (the author adopts the two-element theory), although the means of production are very important factors, people can only carry out production with its help, but the relationship between people and the means of production is a dialectical relationship. In this dialectical relationship, people are the main and decisive factor, while the means of production are determined. The reasons are: (1) The means of production are made by people; (2) The means of production are just a pile of dead things if no one masters and uses them; (3) Productivity itself refers to the relationship between people and nature, and the means of production are only their medium. Therefore, it is not that the means of production change, and then people change accordingly, and productivity develops, but the opposite. This can be proved by the facts of the Great Leap Forward in our country: whether people's minds are liberated, whether people's enthusiasm is sufficient, and people's labor experience and production skills all play a decisive role in the development of productivity, while the means of production change and develop only when people feel it is necessary to improve tools in the process of production practice and productivity development, and under the role of people.

The author also believes that we should not emphasize production experience and labor skills as the most important characteristics of people in the elements of productivity. He said that although people cannot carry out production without certain production experience and labor skills, people are social people, people with consciousness and thought. People's ideological situation, attitude towards labor, understanding of problems, etc., have a huge impact on the development of productivity. The lesson of the saddle shape in my country from 1956 to 1957 to 1958 can prove that in the development process of this production curve, the means of production have not changed much, and people's production experience and labor skills have not changed significantly. However, the development speed of productivity in the three years is very different. The only reason is that people's thinking has changed, their political awareness has been improved, and their understanding and utilization of objective laws have been more sufficient. Therefore, the level of people's ideological awareness, and their degree of understanding and utilization of objective laws, have a certain decisive significance for the development of productivity under certain conditions.

The most revolutionary factor is people's thinking

What is the relationship between people and tools in the two elements of productivity? Is it people who drive tools, or tools that drive people? Regarding this question, Zhao Jibin believes in his article "People and Tools" that demonstrates the Marxist theory of population (published in the fifth issue of "Zhongzhou Review"): The production practice of the working people is the only source of creating tools, and the most active and revolutionary driving force in production practice is not "production experience and labor skills," but ideological consciousness and political awareness. This is the conclusion he reached after introducing Engels's point of view and criticizing Plekhanov's point of view. He said that according to the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in production, the cultural revolution, and the technological revolution in our country, the primary condition for the change and development of production does not start from the change and development of the means of production, but from the brave and hardworking Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong, emerging with the endless power and wisdom to create history. He said: "Due to the establishment of socialist ownership, an infinitely broad prospect has been opened up for the development of productivity, and people's subjective initiative has been unprecedentedly strengthened. Therefore, the scientific truth and revolutionary power of Engels's population theory have been confirmed by the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country after seventy-four years, and have been developed by Chairman Mao." Finally, the author also believes that "denying that people are producers, denying that people are productivity, and not taking people as the determining factor but taking tools as the driving force for production leap forward and waiting for the mechanization of tools, will lead to serious errors in theory and fall into the reactionary quagmire in practice."

    人是生产力发展的动力
    在生产力的发展中  人起着决定作用
    中国人民大学经济系学生周新成在“教学与研究”第十期上发表了“关于‘生产力’的一些问题”一文。他对于“生产力”这概念提出了新的看法。他认为在生产力两要素（作者采用两要素说）中，生产工具虽是很重要的因素，人们只有借助于它才能进行生产，但是，人和生产工具的关系是一个辩证的关系。在这个辩证关系中，人是主要的，决定性的，而生产工具则是被决定的。理由是：（一）生产工具是由人来制造的；（二）生产工具如果没有人去掌握、运用，就是一堆死的东西。（三）生产力本身是指人与自然的关系，生产工具只是它们的媒介。因此，不是生产工具变化了，人才随之变化，生产力才发展，而是相反。这从我国大跃进的事实可以证明：人的思想解放与否，人的干劲足不足，人的劳动经验、生产技能如何，对生产力发展是起决定性作用的，而生产工具则是当人们在生产实践中生产力发展过程中感到有必要改进工具，并且在人的作用下，才引起变化和发展。
    作者同时认为，不应该强调生产经验和劳动技能为生产力要素中人的最主要的特点。他说，虽然没有一定的生产经验和劳动技能，人不能进行生产，但是人是社会的人，是有意识有思想的人，人们的思想情况、对待劳动的态度、对问题的认识等等，对生产力的发展有着巨大的影响。我国1956—1957—1958年的马鞍形的教训可以证明：在这个生产曲线发展过程中，生产工具变化不大，人们的生产经验、劳动技能也没有怎样显著的变化，但是三年生产力发展速度，相差非常大。唯一的原因就是人们的思想变了，政治觉悟提高了，对客观规律的认识和利用更充分了。因此，人的思想觉悟的高低，及其对客观规律的认识和利用程度，对生产力的发展在某种条件下具有一定的决定意义。
    最革命的因素是人的思想
    生产力的两要素中，人和工具的关系怎样？是人带动了工具，还是工具带动了人？关于这个问题，赵纪彬在他写的论证马克思主义人口理论的“人和工具”一文中（载“中州评论”第五期）认为：劳动人民的生产实践是创造工具的唯一源泉，而生产实践中最活跃最革命的动力，不是“生产经验和劳动技能”，而是思想意识和政治觉悟。这是在他介绍了恩格斯的论点，批驳了普列汉诺夫的论点之后得出的结论。他说根据我国生产大跃进，文化革命、技术革命大跃进的高潮来看，生产的变更和发展的首要条件，并非是从生产工具底变更和发展上开始，而是勇敢勤劳的中国人民在伟大的中国共产党和它的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，涌现出了自己创造历史的无穷无尽的力量和智慧。他说：“由于社会主义所有制的树立，为生产力的发展开辟了无限广阔的前途，人的主观能动性空前加强，因而恩格斯人口学说的科学真理及其革命威力，便在七十四年后由我国的工农业生产大跃进所证实，并由毛主席所发展。”最后，作者并认为“否认人是生产者，否认人是生产力，不以人为决定因素而以工具为生产跃进的动力而等待着工具的机械化，将会在理论上导出严重的错误，实践上陷入反动的泥沼。”
