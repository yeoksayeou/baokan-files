Editor's Note:

    Every Grain Returned to the Granary
    Many regions have recovered a lot of grain, cotton, and oilseeds during the re-harvesting and re-threshing process. This "second autumn harvest" is indeed something worth vigorously promoting.
    One of the reasons for the rough harvest is that some people believe that because there is a bumper harvest, it doesn't matter if a little is scattered. Therefore, to carry out the second autumn harvest, we must correct this view in order to thoroughly clean up the autumn harvest battlefield.
    Is it important or not to scatter some grain? This depends on the standpoint from which you speak. Some members of the Liuquan Township in Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, compare their labor achievements to "a grain of food, a drop of sweat." People like this will certainly not scatter grain. Whether scattering a little is important or not also depends on the angle from which you look at it. The numbers scattered from one mu, ten mu, may not be large; however, if you look at it from the perspective of a commune, a county, a province, or even the whole country, then the scattered numbers are not small, but very large.
    We should return every grain of the abundant harvest to the granary.

    粒粒收回仓
    许多地区在复收复打中又收回了不少粮食、棉花和油料，“二次收秋”确是一件值得大提倡的事情。
    收获粗放原因之一，是有些人认为大丰收了，抛撒一点不要紧。因此开展二次收秋就一定要纠正这种观点，才能把秋收战场彻底打扫干净。
    抛撒点粮食究竟要紧不要紧呢？这要看站在什么立场上说话。山西陵川县六泉乡一些社员把他们的劳动果实比喻为“一颗粮食一滴汗”。这样的人肯定不会抛撒粮食的。抛撒点要紧不要紧，还要看从什么角度来看。一亩地、十亩地抛撒的数字可能不算大；但是，如果从一社、一县、一省以至全国来看，那么抛撒的数字就不是不大，而是很大了。
    我们应该把丰产的粮食粒粒收回仓。
