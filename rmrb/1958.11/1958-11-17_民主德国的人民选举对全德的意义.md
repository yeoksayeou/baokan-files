    The Significance of the People's Election in Democratic Germany for All of Germany
    Walther Feiner,
    Member of the Presidium of the National Council of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic
    At present, the struggle to defend European peace, strive for German national unification, oppose the atomic armament policy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and oppose the cold war policy of the West German imperialist ruling clique is becoming increasingly significant. The people's election in the German Democratic Republic is being conducted in such a period. At the same time, the people's election is being conducted at a stage where the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic has reached such a stage: that is, the socialist system will show its superiority to the capitalist system of West Germany in all aspects. The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany pointed out to the German working class and all patriotic forces of Germany the road to strive for peace, strive for the socialist victory of the German Democratic Republic, and strive for mutual understanding between the two Germanys. The Congress determined that the most important thing in the German question is to guarantee peace.
    The German imperialist forces headed by Adenauer, Strauss, and Brentano are determined to complete the atomic armament plan adopted by the Bundestag in 1961. The German Democratic Republic opposes this insidious plan, which not only threatens the security and survival of the German people, but also poses a serious danger to all the people of Europe. It has put forward a peace plan that is designed to raise living standards and bring the consumption of all the most important foods and consumer goods per capita up to and exceed that of the entire West Germany.
    On September 22, 1958, the National Front unanimously adopted the proclamation on the election, which is also the program of struggle of the National Front in the recent period. The National Front advocates uniting the peace forces of all of Germany to oppose the West German imperialist forces and strive for mutual understanding between the two Germanys. The specific content of this program is to sign a peace treaty with Germany, establish a non-nuclear weapons zone in Central Europe, and establish a confederation between the two Germanys.
    West Germany responded to the lofty tasks put forward by the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the National Front to the entire German people by intensifying its attacks on the German Democratic Republic and the entire socialist camp. They tried by all means to obstruct the people's movement against the danger of atomic war and for peace and mutual understanding between the German Democratic Republic and West Germany, while turning a deaf ear to the proposals put forward by the German Democratic Republic regarding the future peaceful Germany. In mid-September, the Eighth Congress of the Christian Democratic Union was held in Kiel. At the meeting, the party announced its program of atomic armament and aggression against the German Democratic Republic. Adenauer's party openly announced that it would lower living standards and social insurance, and demanded further restrictions on the rights and freedoms of residents.
    At the same time, the right-wing leading forces of the Social Democratic Party have long concealed their true intentions and misled the workers. Now they openly adopt the political方針 of Adenauer, Remer, and Deist and others, and try to get the Social Democratic Party parliamentary group to pass the resolution formulated by the Christian Democratic Union at the meeting of the West Berlin parliament on October 1. The purpose of this resolution is to oppose reconciliation with the German Democratic Republic and to intensify the cold war against Germany's first worker-peasant state.
  The residents of the German Democratic Republic, who have embarked on the road of peace, socialism, and German national revival, warmly welcome the election on November 16. The election movement in the German Democratic Republic is a struggle for peace and socialist construction. In order to greet the election, millions of working people are making new contributions every day to consolidate the worker-peasant regime and strive for socialist victory.
    In the one hundred and ninety-four voter representative meetings attended by more than one hundred and forty thousand people, the candidates for representatives of the People's Chamber and the administrative district councils met with everyone. They reported on their work to the voters and explained the campaign program. Before expressing their trust in them, the voters questioned them. Therefore, the election movement in the German Democratic Republic is the practice of socialist democracy, which will stimulate new enthusiasm and promote greater achievements in production, science and technology, and other sectors of social life. In the unbreakable family of socialist countries, the economic, political, and cultural achievements of the German Democratic Republic are thus developing and consolidating day by day in the fraternal solidarity and mutual assistance with the socialist countries. The spiritual and political unity of the people of the German Democratic Republic is thus becoming increasingly consolidated.
    No matter how crazy it is, the policy of the Christian Democratic Union of Adenauer against the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving forces in West Germany will not succeed. The contradictions within the Christian Democratic Union's own ranks have greatly increased; after the congress held in Kiel, Catholic workers have been convinced that they have been deceived and know that the Christian Democratic Union has long abandoned their social ideals. The contradictions among the West German bourgeoisie have also greatly increased; among the bourgeoisie, more and more people are demanding the establishment of normal trade relations with the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries. At the same time, workers all over West Germany are resolutely demanding that the West German government accept the German Democratic Republic's proposal to purchase four million tons of coal, two hundred thousand tons of rolled metal, and eighty to ninety million marks of chemicals, shoes, and textiles from West Germany. Many workers, trade union workers, and members of the Social Democratic Party in West Germany, as well as people from other strata of West Germany, will, in accordance with the advice of the Third Congress of the National Front, see and learn from the vivid example of the people's election in Democratic Germany the democratic rights enjoyed by the people of East Germany.

    民主德国的人民选举对全德的意义
    德意志民主共和国全国阵线
    全国委员会主席团委员  瓦尔切尔·费斯皮尔
    目前，保卫欧洲和平、争取德国民族统一、反对北大西洋公约组织的原子武装政策、反对西德帝国主义统治集团的冷战政策的斗争，越来越具有重大的意义，德意志民主共和国的人民选举就是在这样的时期进行的。同时，人民选举是在德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设已达到这样的阶段进行的：即社会主义制度将在各个方面显示出比西德的资本主义制度优越。德国统一社会党第五次代表大会向德国工人阶级和全德的爱国力量指出争取和平、争取德意志民主共和国的社会主义胜利和争取两个德国互相谅解的道路。代表大会确定，在德国问题上最主要的便是保障和平。
    以阿登纳、斯特劳斯和勃伦塔诺为首的德国帝国主义势力决心要在1961年完成联邦议会通过的原子武装计划。德意志民主共和国反对这个不仅威胁德国人民的安全和生存，而且也是欧洲全体人民的严重危险的阴险计划，它提出了一项和平计划，这项计划预定提高生活水平，使按人口平均计算的所有最重要的粮食和消费品的消费量，赶上和超过整个西德。
    1958年9月22日，全国阵线一致通过了关于选举的文告，这个文告同时也是最近期间全国阵线的斗争纲领。全国阵线主张联合全德的和平力量反对西德帝国主义势力，争取两个德国之间的互相谅解。而签订对德和约、在中欧建立非原子武器区、两个德国建立邦联——这就是这项纲领的具体内容。
    西德用加强对德意志民主共和国和整个社会主义阵营的攻讦来回答德国统一社会党第五次代表大会和全国阵线向德国全体人民提出的崇高任务。他们力图用一切手段阻挠反对原子战争危险、争取和平和德意志民主共和国同西德之间的互相谅解的人民运动，同时对德意志民主共和国提出的有关未来的和平德国的建议，则置若罔闻。9月中旬在基尔举行了基督教民主联盟第八次代表大会。这个党在会上宣布了它的原子武装和侵略德意志民主共和国的纲领。阿登纳的党公开宣布要降低生活水平和社会保险，并要求进一步限制居民的权利和自由。
    同时，社会民主党的右翼领导势力长期掩饰着自己的真正打算，使工人陷入迷途。现在他们公开采取阿登纳、雷墨尔和戴斯特等人的政治方针，力图使社会民主党议会党团通过基督教民主联盟10月1日在西柏林议会开会时制定的决议。这项决议的目的在于反对同德意志民主共和国谅解，并且加强进行反对德国第一个工农国家的冷战。
  走上了和平、社会主义和德国民族复兴道路的德意志民主共和国的居民，热情地迎接11月16日的选举。德意志民主共和国的选举运动就是争取和平和社会主义建设的斗争。为了迎接选举，千百万劳动人民为巩固工农政权、争取社会主义胜利，每日都作出了新的贡献。
    在有十四万多人参加的一百九十四次选民代表会议上，人民议院和行政专区议会代表的候选人同大家见了面。他们向选民作工作报告，解释竞选纲领。选民在向他们表示自己的信任之前，向他们提出质询。因此，德意志民主共和国的选举运动是社会主义民主的实践，它将激起新的干劲，促使人们在生产、科学和技术以及社会生活其他部门达到更大的成就。在社会主义国家牢不可破的大家庭中的德意志民主共和国，在同社会主义各国兄弟般的团结互助中，经济上、政治上和文化上的成就，就这样日益发展和巩固起来。德意志民主共和国人民的精神上和政治上的团结一致，也就这样越来越巩固了。
    阿登纳的基督教民主联盟执行的反对德意志民主共和国和西德一切爱好和平力量的政策，不论怎样疯狂，是不会获得成功的。基督教民主联盟自己队伍中的矛盾大大增加了；在基尔举行的代表大会以后，天主教的工人已经确信他们是被欺骗了，知道基督教民主联盟早已撇开了他们的社会理想。西德资产阶级之间的矛盾也大大增加了；在资产阶级人士中，要求同德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家建立正常的贸易关系的人越来越多了。同时，西德各地的工人坚决要求接受德意志民主共和国向西德购买四百万吨煤、二十万吨压延金属、八千万到九千万马克的化学药品、鞋子和纺织品的建议。西德许多工人、工会工作者和社会民主党的党员以及西德其他居民阶层的人们，将根据全国阵线第三次代表大会的忠告，从民主德国人民选举的生动实例中，看到和学到东德人民所享有的民主权利。
