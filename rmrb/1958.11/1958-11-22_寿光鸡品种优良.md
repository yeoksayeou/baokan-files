Shouguang chicken is one of the famous excellent breeds in the country. There are mainly four types: Cilun chicken, Dabao chicken, Taihe chicken, and Weng chicken.
      Cilun Chicken
    The Cilun chicken has a large body. The rooster weighs more than ten catties, and generally weighs six or seven catties; the hen weighs about four or five catties, and the eggs have thick, red shells, generally weighing three or four taels. The characteristics of this chicken are: strong physique, strong disease resistance, fast growth and development, and suitable for feeding coarse feed.
      Dabao Chicken
    Dabao chicken is produced by mating Cilun chicken with local Taihe chicken and Weng chicken. Its living habits are similar to those of Cilun chicken, with a body weight of about three or four catties, and an egg weight of more than two taels. More than 70% of the agricultural cooperatives in the county raise this kind of chicken.
      Taihe Chicken and Weng Chicken
    Taihe chicken and Weng chicken have smaller bodies, are good at foraging, and have a higher egg production rate. The eggs weigh about one tael or more, and there is a tendency to gradually eliminate them.
    In recent years, due to the development of national foreign trade, Shouguang eggs have become high-quality export goods. From 1956 to 1957, the state purchased 450,000 catties of eggs in the county, which played a significant role in supporting the country's socialist construction.

    寿光鸡品种优良
    寿光鸡是全国著名的优良品种之一。主要有慈伦鸡、大宝鸡、太和鸡和瓮鸡等四种。
      慈伦鸡
    慈伦鸡体躯魁伟，公鸡体重达十余斤，一般也重六、七斤；母鸡重约四、五斤，生蛋皮厚色红，一般重三、四两。这种鸡的特点是：体质健壮，抗病力较强，生长发育快，适于喂粗放饲料。
      大宝鸡
    大宝鸡是慈伦鸡和当地太和鸡、瓮鸡交配而生的，其生活习惯与慈伦鸡相似，体躯约三、四斤左右，蛋重二两多，全县有70％以上的农业社养这种鸡。
      太和鸡和瓮鸡
    太和鸡和瓮鸡，体躯较小，善于觅食，生蛋率较高，蛋重约一两多，现有逐渐淘汰的趋势。
    近年来由于国家对外贸易的发展，寿光鸡蛋成为优质的出口物资，自1956年至1957年国家在该县收购鸡蛋四十五万斤，在支援国家的社会主义建设方面起了很大作用。
