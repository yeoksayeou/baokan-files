    Procurement Work Must Also Launch Satellites
    Xinyang Prefecture Basically Completes Cotton, Tobacco, and Hog Procurement Plans
    Heilongjiang Completes Native and Subsidiary Product Procurement Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 1st: Heilongjiang Province's commercial departments have already overfulfilled this year's procurement plan for native and subsidiary products by 29% ahead of schedule on October 20, increasing the average income of farmers in the province by more than thirty yuan per person.
    Heilongjiang Province's commercial departments used the method of vigorously launching mass movements to mobilize the masses to engage in great airing of views, great contending, and great debates, thoroughly criticizing conservative ideas such as "developing sideline occupations contradicts the central work" and "insufficient labor, sideline occupations cannot leap forward." Shuangcheng County seized the gap in agricultural production and launched more than ten intensive campaigns to purchase native and subsidiary products. Each time, more than 100,000 people and staff from financial and trade departments worked together, and in mid-October, they overfulfilled the annual leap forward plan for purchasing native and subsidiary products. Hejiang Prefecture organized the masses engaged in water conservancy construction, peat harvesting, mining, grazing, and cutting sheep grass to collect native and subsidiary products in conjunction with their own work, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor for engaging in sideline occupations. Heilongjiang Province's commercial departments also started with production, combined with procurement, and cultivated a large amount of sources of native and subsidiary products.
    This newspaper Zhengzhou, 2nd: Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, adopted the method of launching commercial satellites, making the work of large-scale purchase and sale fast and good. In the short period of twenty days in early and mid-October, the entire prefecture has completed 82% of the fourth quarter procurement plan for agricultural and sideline products and 62% of the material supply plan. As of the 20th, this year's cotton and flue-cured tobacco procurement tasks have been overfulfilled ahead of schedule, and the live hog procurement task has also been basically completed.
    According to the experience of Xinyang Prefecture, criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking is the key to launching commercial satellites, and vivid facts are the most powerful ideological criticism.
    October is the busiest season for large-scale iron and steel production, deep plowing, and autumn harvesting and planting. At the beginning of September, the Luoshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party only focused on grasping iron and steel production and agricultural work, squeezing out commercial procurement work, and was given a white flag in the competition among the financial and trade systems of the entire prefecture. In order to remove the white flag, the county committee decided to use the intervals between iron and steel production and plowing to carry out intensive procurement days. Specific dates were set for the collection of cotton, live pigs, fresh eggs, and hemp. The entire party and the entire people were mobilized, and as a result, the entire year's procurement tasks for cotton and hemp were completed in one day, and the progress of fresh egg and live pig procurement work was also greatly accelerated. The entire prefecture leaped into the most advanced red flag unit.
    One of the experiences of Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, in launching commercial "satellites" is to organize debates to liberate thinking. Under the leadership of the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, each county conducted debates on the topics of "If others can launch satellites, can we launch satellites?" and "If grain and iron and steel can launch satellites, can commercial financial and trade work launch satellites?" Analyzing the favorable conditions brought about by the establishment of people's communes and the decentralization of the financial and trade system to procurement work, and criticizing various right-leaning conservative ideas. Around October 11, a high tide of launching commercial satellites was set off everywhere. From the 11th to the 15th, the procurement volume of agricultural and sideline products in the entire prefecture, compared with the previous five days: cotton increased by more than four times, flue-cured tobacco increased by thirty times, live pigs increased by more than seven times, and fresh eggs increased by thirty-four times. Other scrap copper and broken iron have also increased exponentially.
    Secondly, like launching iron and steel "satellites," the secretary must take the lead and mobilize the entire people. Prepare in advance for launching commercial "satellites." The county-level commercial departments should put forward a plan for launching "satellites" in order to facilitate the overall arrangement of various tasks by the party committee. Establish command posts at all levels, headed by the party committee secretary. At the same time, organize propaganda teams to widely and deeply publicize the specific dates, requirements, and precautions for launching "satellites" to the masses. Grassroots commercial departments should take stock of warehouses, arrange funds, transfer procedures, transportation, etc. In addition, commercial, financial, banking, and other departments must strengthen cooperation.
    Third, it is necessary to rely on the masses to inspect the grade, purchase, and transport themselves. After concentrating the purchased materials in the people's commune warehouse, the masses are still responsible for their own care. The custodians are responsible to the state, ensuring quality and quantity. The commercial department accepts the goods in the warehouse, and the procedures are simple.

### 收购工作也要放卫星  信阳专区棉烟猪收购计划基本完成  黑龙江提前完成土副产品收购计划

    收购工作也要放卫星
    信阳专区棉烟猪收购计划基本完成
    黑龙江提前完成土副产品收购计划
    据新华社哈尔滨1日电　黑龙江省商业部门已经提前在10月20日超额29％完成了今年土副产品的采购计划，给全省农民平均每人增加了三十多元的收入。
    黑龙江省商业部门用大搞群众运动的办法，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，彻底批判了“搞副业和中心工作矛盾”和“劳动力不足，副业就无法跃进”等保守思想。双城县抓住农业生产空隙，展开了十多次收购土副产品的突击运动，每次有十多万群众和财贸部门的职工一起动手，在10月中旬就超额完成了全年收购土副产品的跃进计划。合江专区把修水利的、搞草炭的、采矿的、放牧的和打羊草的群众都组织起来结合本身工作采集土副产品，解决了搞副业劳力不足的困难。黑龙江省商业部门还从生产入手，结合采购，培植了大量土副产品的货源。
    本报郑州2日电　河南省信阳专区采取大放商业卫星的办法，使大购大销工作做得又快又好。在10月上、中旬短短二十天时间，全专区已经完成第四季度农副产品采购计划的82％，物资供应计划的62％。到20日止，今年的棉花、烤烟收购任务已经提前超额完成，活猪收购任务也基本上完成。
    根据信阳专区的经验，批判右倾保守思想是大放商业卫星的关键，而活生生的事实则是最有力的思想批判。
    10月份是大搞钢铁，深翻土地，秋收秋种最繁忙的季节。中共罗山县委在9月初只顾抓钢铁抓农活，把商业采购工作挤掉了，在全专区财贸系统竞赛中被插上白旗。为了拔去白旗，县委会决定利用钢铁、翻地的间歇时间，开展突击收购日。具体规定收棉、活猪、鲜蛋、麻的日期，全党、全民动员，结果一天便完成了全年棉花、麻的采购任务，鲜蛋、活猪采购工作也大大加快了进度。在全专区——跃成为最先进的红旗单位。
    河南信阳专区商业工作大放“卫星”的经验之一是组织辩论解放思想。在中共信阳地委的领导下，各县都以“人家能放卫星，我们能不能放卫星？”、“粮食钢铁能放卫星，商业财贸工作能不能放卫星？”为题，进行辩论。分析人民公社成立和财贸体制下放给采购工作带来的有利条件，批判各种右倾保守思想。到10月11日前后，便在各地掀起大放商业卫星的高潮。全专区11日到15日农副产品采购量，和上五日相比：棉花增加四倍多，烤烟增加三十倍，生猪增加七倍多，鲜蛋上升三十四倍。其他碎铜烂铁等都有成倍增加。
    其次，要像放钢铁“卫星”那样，书记挂帅，全民动员。放商业“卫星”事前要作好准备工作。县级商业部门要提出放“卫星”的规划，以便于党委全面安排各项工作。要层层建立指挥部，由党委书记挂帅。同时要组织宣传队，向群众广泛深入宣传放“卫星”的具体日期、要求和注意事项。基层商业部门要进行清点仓库，安排资金，转账手续、运输等。此外，商业、财政、银行等部门还必须加强协作。
    第三，必须依靠群众自己验级、自己收购、自己运输。把采购物资集中到人民公社仓库后，仍由群众自己看管。看管员对国家负责，保质保量。商业部门就仓验收，手续简便。
