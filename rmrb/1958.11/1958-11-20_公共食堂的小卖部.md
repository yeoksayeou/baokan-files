The Public Canteen's Tuck Shop
By Our Correspondent Hao Jian

	One midday, after a sudden rain shower, I visited the tuck shop of the public canteen at the First Team of the Fourth Brigade of the East Zhao People's Commune in the northern suburbs of Zhengzhou. As soon as I entered, I found it crowded with customers. Some were buying egg drop soup, some were buying fried meatballs, some were buying stir-fried dishes, and others were bringing plump hens and lively carp for the canteen to cook for them...

	This tuck shop is run by the public canteen of the First Team. It not only provides over thirty kinds of inexpensive and delicious meals daily, such as sugar buns, sweet soup, noodles, dumplings, fried dough cakes, and fish, meat, and vegetables, but also has a processing department. No matter how much or how little food a member has, they can bring it to the tuck shop to be prepared, and the processing fee is very cheap. To accommodate the members, the processing department works from early morning to late at night, preparing food whenever it is needed. At the same time, the tuck shop also sells cigarettes, alcohol, and braised dishes.

	The members here praise the tuck shop to anyone they meet. While I was visiting the tuck shop, I happened to meet a 75-year-old man named Huang Zhenlu, who was bringing a large hen to be cooked. It turned out that the old man had been sick for seven or eight months, and when he was very ill, the tuck shop made noodles and egg drop soup for him every day for over a month, until his health gradually improved. Today, he was bringing a chicken to improve his diet. Another member told me this story: In June of this year, Yang Shufang gave birth to a son, but after two months, her milk suddenly dried up. The child cried all day because he had no milk. Although the public canteen provided her with flour, the child only drank noodle soup all day and never gained weight. Yang Shufang was very worried. Just then, the tuck shop was established. They made sweet soup or steamed egg custard for him every day, and after half a month, the child was growing very well.

	The tuck shop not only takes care of the lives of the sick and children but also provides great convenience for members celebrating birthdays and entertaining guests. A few days ago, when 60-year-old Cao Guozheng celebrated his birthday, his daughter Cao Xiaorong specially brought back a carp weighing more than two pounds from the Yellow River from her in-laws' home. He added a chicken himself, and the tuck shop made four or five dishes, as well as some wine. The family happily enjoyed a meal together. Cao Guozheng repeatedly praised that this was the first time in his life that he had eaten such good food for his birthday. Cao Yurong, who had just returned from her in-laws' home, said, "Having the tuck shop is so convenient for the members. A month ago, when my husband came to East Zhao Village for the first time, we had neither money nor the ability to cook. We had the tuck shop process two chickens and made seven or eight dishes, including spicy chicken, stewed chicken, shredded chicken, and stir-fried chicken giblets, all for just over one yuan, which is much cheaper than a restaurant."

	After visiting the tuck shop, Luo Xuehai, the captain of the First Team, introduced the simple process of establishing the tuck shop to me. He said that since the team's agricultural busy season canteen had been converted into a public canteen, they had found that the large canteen could only provide ordinary meals with very few varieties, which was inconvenient for the members. For example, if guests came to the house or an elderly person had a birthday, it was inconvenient to add a few good dishes. Therefore, the commune decided to open the tuck shop. This was done to take care of the small freedoms within the large collective and to provide the members with many conveniences. The East Zhao Commune Management Committee (now renamed the East Zhao Brigade after the establishment of the People's Commune) was very concerned about and supported this matter. They immediately hired two chefs, and the members also contributed pots, pans, and furniture, and helped repair the kitchen and stoves. The tuck shop was quickly established. Now the tuck shop has formulated a production plan to open a flour mill and raise more chickens, ducks, and fish so that members can eat more and cheaper meals.

### 公共食堂的小卖部

    公共食堂的小卖部
    本报记者  郝健
    在一个骤雨初歇的中午，我到郑州市北郊人民公社东赵第四中队一分队公共食堂的小卖部去参观。一进小卖部，里边挤满了顾客，有买鸡蛋汤的，有买油炸丸子的，有买炒菜的，还有提着肥胖的大母鸡和活蹦乱跳的大鲤鱼来找食堂代为烹调的……。
    这个小卖部是一分队的公共食堂开办的，每天不仅备有糖包、甜汤、挂面、水饺、油饼和鱼肉蔬菜等三十多种价廉物美的饭菜，而且还设有加工部，不管社员东西多少都可以拿到小卖部去做，而且加工费非常便宜。为了照顾社员，加工部从清早到晚上一直工作，随要随做。同时，小卖部还设有烟酒和卤菜。
    这里的社员见人就夸赞小卖部。在我参观小卖部的时候，正好碰见一位七十五岁的黄振洛老汉提着一只大母鸡来做菜。原来，这个老汉生了七、八个月的病，在病得很厉害的时候，小卖部天天给他做挂面和鸡蛋汤，一连吃了一个多月，身体才渐渐地壮实起来，今天他又来杀鸡改善生活哩。又有一个社员告诉我这样一段事：在今年6月间，杨淑芳生了一个小子，不料过了两个月，她的奶突然断了。小孩没有奶整天哭闹，公共食堂虽然发给她的面，可是小孩整天喝面汤，总是吃不胖。杨淑芳心里很着急，正在这时，小卖部成立了，每天不是给他做甜汤，就是炖鸡蛋糕，半个月后，小孩长得很好。
    小卖部不仅照顾了病人和小孩的生活，而且对社员过生日和招待客人都给了很大的方便。前几天，六十多岁的曹国政过生日时，他闺女曹小蓉特地从婆家提来了一条二斤多重的黄河大鲤鱼，他自己又添了一只鸡，在小卖部做了四、五样菜，另外还打了几两酒，一家人欢欢乐乐地吃了一顿。曹国政连连称赞，这是他过生日以来头一回能吃到这样好的菜。刚从婆家回来不久的曹玉蓉说：“有了小卖部对社员可方便哩，一个月前，我爱人第一次来东赵庄时，家里既没有钱又不会做菜，在小卖部加工了两只鸡就做出了七、八样菜，有辣子鸡、清炖鸡、炒鸡丝和炒鸡杂等，一共才花了一元多，这比饭馆要便宜得多哩。”
    在小卖部参观完后，一分队队长罗学海向我介绍了成立小卖部的简单经过。他说，这个队自农忙食堂转为公共食堂后，便发现在大食堂里，只能供应花样很少的普通饭菜，对社员有很多不方便。例如家里来了客人，老人过生日等要想增加几样好菜，都不方便。于是社里就决定开办了小卖部，这样做，是为了照顾大集体中的小自由，使社员有很多的方便。东赵社管理委员会（人民公社成立后，现改为东赵大队）对这件事十分关心和支持，立刻请了两名厨师，社员们还拿出锅碗和家具等，并帮助修理了厨房和炉灶，小卖部很快就成立起来了。现在小卖部已订出了生产计划，准备开设粉厂和多养鸡鸭，多养鱼，使社员们能够吃到更多更便宜的饭菜。
