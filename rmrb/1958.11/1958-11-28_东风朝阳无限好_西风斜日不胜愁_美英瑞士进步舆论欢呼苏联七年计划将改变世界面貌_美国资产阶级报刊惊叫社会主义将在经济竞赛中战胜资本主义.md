Title: The East Wind and Morning Sun are Infinitely Good; The West Wind and Slanting Sun are Utterly Melancholy - Progressive Public Opinion in the United States, Britain, and Switzerland Cheer that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan Will Change the World; American Bourgeois Newspapers Shriek that Socialism Will Defeat Capitalism in the Economic Race

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Public opinion in various countries continues to comment on the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan, pointing out that the socialist system has great advantages, while Western countries are caught in an increasingly deep economic crisis, and the capitalist system is increasingly declining.

The American "Worker's Weekly" published an article by George Morris on November 23, arguing that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is a new proof of the Soviet Union's desire for lasting peace and a peaceful competition challenge with the greatest impact on capitalism.

The article points out that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan will increase its production by 80% and make the living standards of the Soviet people the highest in the world by 1970. At the same time, by 1965, socialist countries around the world will produce more than half of the world's output.

The article, emphasizing the inspirational role this plays for workers in capitalist countries, states, "It can greatly help workers in capitalist countries. In many capitalist countries, workers have already been able to see the progress of socialism and the fear of capitalism regarding the growing influence of socialism. In the next seven years, the progress of socialism will become a factor, even in the United States (where its workers' average wages are still higher than in any other country)."

A recent editorial in the British "World News" emphasized the contrast between the rapid development of the socialist system and the increasing decline of the capitalist system.

"World News" pointed out: "In a few years, China's industrial output will exceed that of Britain, its coal production has already exceeded that of Britain, and its grain and cotton production has exceeded that of the United States." "The Soviet Union, shortly after the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, will catch up with the United States not only in total output but also in per capita output."

"World News" said: "In capitalist countries, stagnation and even decline are prevalent phenomena. This happens from time to time wherever capitalism reigns."

"World News" said: "Today, the development of socialism and the decline of capitalism have become a contrast." "It is this contrast that makes the restless economists and propagandists of capitalism shout 'the communist economic challenge'. They are worried that the 'free enterprise' system they cherish cannot meet the challenge. That is why Dulles and his lackeys dream of destroying communism by force. They know their end is coming soon."

The Swiss "Voice of Labor" published an article on the 22nd, commenting on the draft outline of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan. The newspaper believes that this is "the Soviet Union's peaceful challenge to the capitalist world," and the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will "change the face of the world."

"Voice of Labor" said that Khrushchev's report outline on the 1959-1965 Seven-Year Plan to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was like a bolt from the blue to Western observers in Moscow. According to this plan, the Soviet Union will build the material and technical foundation of communism within fifteen years.

The newspaper concluded by saying that by 1965, socialist countries would produce more than half of the world's industrial products, and the absolute superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system in the production of material wealth would be further guaranteed.

Faced with the vigorous development of the Soviet economy, many American bourgeois newspapers have had to admit that the Soviet Union can complete the Seven-Year Plan and that the socialist system can win the economic competition with capitalism.

John S. Knight, publisher of the "Chicago Daily News," wrote in an editorial that the Soviet-prescribed Seven-Year Plan promises to give the Soviet people the highest standard of living in the world, and this plan "deserves more attention." Knight pointed out that, in general, "the United States has often underestimated statements about Russian achievements before those achievements become obvious facts," which is a mistake made by the United States.

Knight said, "Now it cannot" regard the Soviet Union's statement that it will "surpass the United States in production by about 1970" "as empty talk with political purposes."

The "Des Moines Register" also said that the Soviet economic plans had "often been ridiculed by the capitalist West," but this "ridicule has obviously become lower and lower in recent years" because the Soviet Union "has proved that it can make great economic progress – progress faster than the United States."

The newspaper said: "The successful launch of the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite has more powerfully awakened the critics of the communist economic system in the West than anything else."

A recent issue of "Newsweek" prominently featured an article by its chief European correspondent, Griffiths, entitled "The Very Startling Red Experiment." Griffiths said that an American expert said that if the goals set out in the report are achieved as scheduled, "the communist world will clearly win the economic competition with the West."

    东风朝阳无限好　西风斜日不胜愁
    美英瑞士进步舆论欢呼苏联七年计划将改变世界面貌
    美国资产阶级报刊惊叫社会主义将在经济竞赛中战胜资本主义
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论继续评论苏联的七年计划，纷纷指出社会主义制度具有巨大优越性，而西方国家则陷入日益深重的经济危机，资本主义制度正日益没落。
    11月23日的美国“工人周报”发表了乔治·摩里斯写的一篇文章，认为苏联七年计划是苏联要持久和平的一个新的证明，这是对资本主义提出的一个影响最大的和平竞赛的挑战。
    文章指出，苏联的七年计划将使它的生产提高80％，并且使苏联人民的生活水平到1970年成为世界上最高的生活水平。与此同时，全世界社会主义国家到1965年所生产出来的东西将占世界产量的一半以上。
    文章在着重指出这对于资本主义国家工人所起的鼓舞作用时说，“它能够大大帮助资本主义国家的工人。在许多资本主义国家内，工人们已经能够看到社会主义的进展，看到资本主义害怕社会主义日益增长的影响。在今后七年内，社会主义的进展甚至在美国（它的工人平均工资仍比其他所有国家都高）也会成为一个起作用的因素。”
    最近一期的英国“世界新闻”的社论着重把社会主义制度的迅速发展同资本主义制度的日益没落作了对比。
    “世界新闻”指出：“在几年内，中国工业品产量将超过英国，它的煤产量已经超过英国，它的谷物和棉花产量已经超过美国。苏联在七年计划完成后不久，就不仅将在总产量而且将在按人口计算的产量方面赶上美国”。
    “世界新闻”说：“在资本主义国家里，停滞不前，甚至下降是流行的现象。凡是由资本主义统治的地方，就不时发生这种情况。”
    “世界新闻”说：“今天，社会主义的发展和资本主义的没落成了对照。”“正是这种对照使得资本主义的坐立不安的经济学家和宣传员大叫‘共产主义经济挑战’。他们担心的是，他们所珍视的‘自由企业’制度无法应付挑战。这就是杜勒斯以及他的走狗为什么梦想以武力毁灭共产主义。他们知道他们的末日快要来到”。
    瑞士“工人之声报”22日发表文章，评论苏联的七年计划纲要。这家报纸认为，这是“苏联向资本主义世界的和平挑战”，七年计划的实现将使“世界面貌改观”。
    “工人之声报”说，赫鲁晓夫向苏联共产党中央委员会提出的1959—1965年七年计划报告纲要，使莫斯科的西方观察家感到有如晴天霹雳。根据这个计划，在十五年内，苏联就要建成共产主义的物质和技术基础。
    报纸最后说，到1965年，社会主义国家所生产的工业产品将占世界工业产品的一半以上，社会主义制度在物质财富的生产方面对于资本主义制度的绝对优越性，将进一步得到保证。
    面对着苏联经济的蓬勃发展，就是美国许多资产阶级报纸也不得不承认，苏联能够完成七年计划，社会主义制度能够在同资本主义进行的经济竞赛中取得胜利。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”发行人奈伊特在社论中写道，苏联规定的七年计划许下诺言，要使苏联人民享有世界上最高的生活水平，这个计划“值得给予更多的重视”。奈伊特指出，总的说来，“在俄国的成就没有成为明显事实之前，美国对有关俄国成就的声明往往估计不足”，这是美国所犯的错误。
    奈伊特说，“现在不能”把苏联“大约在1970年将在生产上超过美国”的这种声明“看作是具有政治目的的空谈了”。
    “得梅因纪事报”也说，苏联的经济计划过去“常常遭到资本主义西方的嘲笑”，这种“嘲笑声近年来显然越来越低了”，因为苏联“证实了它能够取得巨大的经济进步——比美国更快地进步”。
    这家报纸说：“苏联第一颗人造卫星的发射成功比任何东西都更有力地使西方的共产主义经济制度的批评家们清醒了过来。”
    最近一期的“新闻周刊”以显著地位刊登了它驻在欧洲的主要记者格里菲思的一篇文章，标题是“非常惊人的红色试验”。格里菲思说，有一个美国专家说，如果报告中所规定的目标如期实现，“共产主义世界显然就会在同西方的经济竞赛中获得胜利”。
