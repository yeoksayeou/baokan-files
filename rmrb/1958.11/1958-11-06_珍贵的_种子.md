　　The First Article Praising the October Revolution

　　Ten months after the October Revolution, Li Dazhao, one of China's earliest Marxists, published "A Comparative View of the French and Russian Revolutions," the first article by the Chinese people praising the October Socialist Revolution. The "Yanzhi Quarterly," which published this article, has only recently been discovered and is now in the collection of the Preparatory Office of the Central Revolutionary Museum.

　　In this article, Comrade Li Dazhao discussed the essential differences between the October Revolution and the French bourgeois revolution. He clearly pointed out the great historical significance of the October Revolution: "The Russian Revolution is a revolution of the early 20th century, a revolution based on society." It "is not only a clear sign of the changes in the hearts of the Russian people, but also a clear sign of the universal psychological changes in mankind throughout the 20th century... We can only look forward to welcoming the dawn of a new world civilization in Russia's current events, and listen to the news of a new Russia built on freedom and humanity."

　　In October 1918, just as the imperialists and their lackeys were vigorously publicizing the victory of the Entente over Germany in World War I as a victory for "humanity" and "truth," attempting to erase the influence of the October Revolution, Li Dazhao published two famous essays in "New Youth," "The Victory of the Common People" and "The Victory of Bolshevism," wholeheartedly praising the October Revolution and cheering the victory of the socialist revolution. Based on preliminary Marxist viewpoints, he correctly analyzed the imperialist nature of World War I and pointed out the great significance of the October Socialist Revolution.

　　A Cartoon from Forty Years Ago

　　In the picture, a worker holds up a large bulletin board with the claims "Announced by the Russian Social Revolutionary Army": "Bread freedom, land freedom, strike freedom... Implementation: Armistice, confiscation of private property, abolition of religious social classes, opening of conquered countries..." In front of it stands a fat capitalist, holding his safe, taking off his top hat, and looking at the bulletin with tears streaming down his face. In the upper left corner of the painting is a sentence: "Why not one family cry rather than everyone cry," explaining that the capitalist's family "crying" could prevent more people from "crying."

　　This cartoon reflects the Chinese people's longing for the October Revolution as early as forty years ago. It was published in the "Labor Magazine" in Shanghai more than four months after the October Revolution, and it was prominently placed on the front page. This memorable magazine is now in the collection of the Beijing Normal University Library.

　　At the same time, this magazine published an article entitled "The Political Strategies Implemented by the Russian Bolsheviks," clearly expressing that the Chinese people recognized from their feelings that the October Revolution was the first proletarian revolution in human history. The article began with: "...The amazing Russian revolution has caused a worldwide sensation, and people all over the world are paying attention and concerned about it, inquiring about its news, and studying its results. Officials and bureaucrats are afraid that their troubles will become too big and that their own power and position will not be preserved. Big landlords and big capitalists are even more afraid that their troubles will become too big and that their private property obtained through fraud and deprivation will vanish once the communist world is implemented... Only those unfortunate laborers are waiting for their revolution to succeed sooner, to spread sooner, so that the masses can share equal happiness and live free lives. Therefore, telegrams from Russia are especially noteworthy, and news from the Bolsheviks is especially welcome." This article also introduced the political measures after the October Revolution and the profound impact of the October Revolution on European countries.

　　This issue of the magazine also published "A Brief Biography of Lenin, the Pioneer of the Russian Social Revolution." More than a month before the publication of this article, "Eastern Magazine" introduced the great revolutionary teacher Lenin to the Chinese people for the first time. At that time, these articles greatly inspired the Chinese people.

　　The October Cannon Fire Brought Marxism

　　Forty years ago, Comrade Li Dazhao wrote many articles praising the October Revolution in a room in the southeast corner of the first floor of the Red Building in Sand灘, Beijing, becoming the clarion call for arousing the people to move towards revolution.

　　This room has now been turned into a memorial room. On Comrade Li Dazhao's desk is a bound volume of the "Weekly Review" that he personally edited. People saw the first Chinese translation of "The Communist Manifesto" after it was transmitted to China in the April 6, 1916 issue. The editor wrote such an editor's note: "This manifesto is Marx and Engels' first and most important opinion. When they published it, it was from November 1847 to January 1848. Its main purpose is to advocate class warfare (i.e., class struggle) and to call for the union of workers in various places. It is a document representing a new era."

　　Later, this publication, which spread Marxism, successively introduced the Soviet Union's new constitution, land law, marriage law, etc., calling on people to study and research them.

　　China's early Marxists began to sow the precious seeds of the October Socialist Revolution on the land of China.

　　A Souvenir from Twenty-Seven Years Ago

　　Among the large number of old and yellowed publications collected by the Preparatory Office of the Central Revolutionary Museum, there is a booklet with the title "Youth in Disaster." When people opened this disguised cover, they unexpectedly saw many articles written by revolutionaries under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the October Revolution. The article "Commemorating the 14th Anniversary of the October Revolution" described the historical significance of the October Revolution and pointed out that the light of the October Revolution illuminated the path forward for the youth of our country, who were searching for light in the darkness. It also called on the vast number of young people to fight for "the victory of China's October Revolution." At the same time, it published the resolution of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League on October 1: "Outline of the Work to Commemorate the 14th Anniversary of the October Revolution."

　　A "Special Announcement" was published on the inside cover of this booklet, which inspired young people to fight. It explained that the frenzied white terror at the time caused great difficulties in the printing of this publication. The manuscripts for the July, August, and September issues that were being printed were destroyed. Therefore, the publication had not been able to meet readers in various places for several months. After arduous struggle, this issue was finally rushed to print during the October Revolution Festival. This is a souvenir left by Chinese youth commemorating the 14th anniversary of the October Revolution twenty-seven years ago.

    珍贵的“种子”
    新华社记者　孙世恺
      歌颂十月革命的第一篇文章
    十月革命后十个月，我国最早的马克思主义者李大钊便发表了“法俄革命之比较观”，这是我国人民歌颂十月社会主义革命的第一篇文章。刊载这篇文章的“言治季刊”，近年来才被人们发现，现收藏在中央革命博物馆筹备处。
    李大钊同志在这篇文章中论述了十月革命和法国的资产阶级革命的本质区别。他明确指出十月革命的伟大历史意义：“俄罗斯之革命，是二十世纪初期之革命，是立于社会上之革命”，它“非独俄罗斯人心变动之显兆，实二十世纪全世界人类普遍心理变动之显兆……，吾人对于俄罗斯今日之事变，惟有翘首以迎其世界的新文明之曙光，倾耳以迎其建于自由人道上之新俄罗斯之消息。”
    在1918年10月，正当帝国主义及其走狗把第一次世界大战中协约国对德国的胜利，当作“人道”和“真理”的胜利来大肆宣传，企图抹煞十月革命的影响，李大钊又在“新青年”上发表了“庶民的胜利”、“布尔什维主义的胜利”两篇著名的论文，竭力赞扬十月革命，欢呼社会主义革命的胜利。他根据初步的马克思主义的观点，正确地分析了第一次世界大战的帝国主义性质，指出十月社会主义革命的重大意义。
          四十年前的一幅漫画
    在画面上，劳动者举着一张大的布告牌，写着：“俄罗斯社会革命军公布”的主张：“面包自由、土地自由、罢工自由……执行：休战、没收私产、革除宗教的社会的阶级、开放被征服国……”在它的前面却站着个肥胖的资本家，手扶保险箱脱下大礼帽望着布告满脸流泪。在画的左上角还题了一句话：“一路哭何如一家哭”，说明资本家一家“哭”，就可以使得更多的人不“哭”了。
    这幅漫画反映出我国人民早在四十年前向往十月革命的心情。它是十月革命后四个多月在上海出版的“劳动杂志”发表的，放在首页，十分醒目。这份可纪念的杂志现藏在北京师范大学图书馆中。
    在这份杂志上同时发表了“俄国过激派（即布尔什维克党）施行之政略”一文，显明地表达出我国人民从感觉中认识了十月革命是人类历史上破天荒第一次的无产阶级革命。在文章的开头就这样写道：“……俄罗斯惊人的革命，也闹得轰天震地，世界人士莫不瞩目关心，打听他的消息，研究他的结果，做官做宦的恐怕他们乱子闹大了，把自己的利禄势位也保不住，大地主大富翁又恐怕他们乱子闹大了，共产世界一旦实行，把自己欺诈剥夺所得的私产化为乌有……只有那些不幸的劳动家，天天盼望他们的革命早早成功，早早普及，好大众共享平等的幸福，同过自由的日子，所以俄罗斯来的电报，是格外得人注意，过激党（即布尔什维克党）传的消息，格外得人欢迎。”这篇文章又介绍十月革命后的政治措施，以及十月革命在欧洲各国引起的深刻影响。
    这期杂志还刊登了“俄罗斯社会革命之先锋李宁（即列宁）事略”。在这篇文章发表前一个多月，“东方杂志”曾第一次向中国人民介绍了伟大的革命导师列宁。当时这些文章都大大地振奋了中国人民。
      十月的炮响送来了马克思主义
    四十年前，李大钊同志在北京沙滩红楼一楼东南角的一间房子里，写下许多颂扬十月革命的文章，成为当时唤起人民走向革命的号角。
    这间房子现已改为纪念室。在李大钊同志办公桌前摆着他亲手主编的“每周评论”合订本。人们在1916年4月6日一期上看到了“共产党的宣言”传到中国后第一篇的中文摘译。编者写下这样的按语：“这个宣言是马克思和恩格斯最先最重大的意见，他们发表的时候，是由1847年的11月到1848年正月，其要旨在主张阶级战争（即阶级斗争），要求各地劳工的联合，是表示新的时代的文书。”
    后来，这个传播马克思主义的刊物又相继介绍了苏联新宪法、土地法、婚姻法等，号召人们去学习、研究。
    我国早期的马克思主义者就这样开始在我国的大地上播种下十月社会主义革命的珍贵种子。
          二十七年前的一件纪念品
    在中央革命博物馆筹备处收藏的大批年久发黄的刊物中，有一本封面上印着“灾荒里青年”小册子，当人们揭开这个伪装的封面，却出人意料地看到革命者在国民党反动派统治下为纪念十月革命十四周年而写的许多文章。在“纪念十月革命十四周年”一文中叙述十月革命的历史意义后，指出十月革命的光芒给正在黑暗中探求光明的我国青年照亮了前进的方向。并号召广大青年为“中国的十月革命的胜利”而斗争。同时，又刊载了中国共产主义青年团中央10月1日的决议：“十月革命十四周年纪念工作大纲”。
    在这本鼓舞青年战斗的小册子的封里上登了一个“特别启事”，说明当时由于疯狂的白色恐怖使这个刊物印刷遭到很大的困难，正在排印的七、八、九月三期稿子均被毁灭，因此，该刊在数月间未能与各地读者相见，经过艰苦的斗争，终于把这一期赶到十月革命节时付印出来。这是二十七年前我国青年纪念十月革命十四周年留下的纪念品。
