    American Economist Hobbes Argues That the American Economic Crisis Has Not Passed
    (This newspaper dispatch) Moscow, November 6th, via "Foreign Trade Information Bulletin": An article discussing the prospects of the American economy in 1959 quoted American economist Hobbes, explaining that the American economic crisis has not passed, and production and exports will sharply decrease in 1959.
    In his speech to the Toronto Security Traders Club on October 14th, Hobbes pointed out that the artificial measures taken by the U.S. government to support economic activity in the current economic crisis have caused a government budget deficit. This is only a temporary stimulant and will not promote long-term economic growth. He said that this does not rule out some increase in the industrial production index in the coming months of this year. However, Hobbes pointed out that by April 1959, the industrial production index would fall to the lowest point of the same period in 1958. At that time, the Federal Reserve Board's industrial production index was 126 points (with 1947 to 1949 as 100), that is, it fell to the lowest level since October 1954. Moreover, according to Hobbes, by April 1959, the industrial production in the United States may fall sharply to 120 points, the lowest level since 1952.
    Hobbes used the following points to argue his assertion.
    First, the current facts do not prove the expectations of some economists that investment in 1959 will greatly increase. Statistics prove that the excess of U.S. productivity is the largest since 1937. Therefore, it can almost be asserted that even for the whole year, capital expenditures will reach 30 to 31 billion U.S. dollars, and U.S. investment in the first half of next year will decrease by 5-8% compared with the same period in 1958. Supporting this conclusion is the fact that current orders for machine tools are 50% lower than last year and 70% lower than in 1956.
    Second, next year, the U.S. government will probably not allocate funds for construction projects as it did at the beginning of this year. Even if the conditions for banks to provide credit are the same as before June to September, residential mortgage loans in 1959 will have to be reduced by at least 10%, because many central areas have an excess of housing. Without artificially easing credit conditions, residential construction next year will decrease by 15-20% compared with this year.
    Third, there are already signs that U.S. government spending will be cut after the election, because government orders increased significantly this spring.
    Fourth, the low level of demand with payment ability in the United States hinders the expansion of production, and consumer debt has reached an unprecedented high. By the end of August this year, the total amount of consumer credit had reached 43.2 billion U.S. dollars.
    Fifth, due to the deterioration of the foreign exchange situation in many countries and many other reasons, the export volume of the United States in 1959 will decrease by 2 to 4 billion U.S. dollars, which will seriously affect the economic sectors related to exports in the United States.
    Sixth, although the inventory of goods has decreased somewhat, the number is still very large. The current ratio index of inventory to sales exceeds the average level of the past decade. If the industrial production index reaches 140 points again, the process of inventory growth may repeat itself, and the government's reduction in procurement will contribute to this trend.
    (This newspaper dispatch) The U.S. "Worker's Weekly" published an article on November 23rd saying: Some "recoveries" that the United States constantly heard before the election are just some exaggerated figures published by the government. Even in the aspects where the government's statement is based, there has been a significant slowdown in the upward trend.
    The First National City Bank's November newsletter, in pointing out the "slowdown" and "pause" in durable goods, said, "Some people are asking whether recent developments are a signal of a renewed decline." The publication does not think so. "New York Times" economic analyst Mooney said: "The initial signs of recovery are not as strong as advertised. Officially published statistics on the gross national product—the value of all products and services—make it seem as if three-quarters of the recession losses had been recovered by the end of September. However, unpublished estimates that take into account price changes consider the extent of recovery to be closer to one-third."
    The article also pointed out: Economists expect that due to seasonal factors, the number of unemployed will have a new increase. "New York Times" analysts also believe that the number of unemployed is expected to increase from the current 3.8 million to 4.5 million in the winter months.

### 美国经济学家霍布斯论证  美国经济危机并没有过去

    美国经济学家霍布斯论证
    美国经济危机并没有过去
    本报讯　苏联“国外商情公报”11月6日登载一篇谈1959年美国经济前景的文章，文章引用美国经济学家霍布斯的谈话，说明美国的经济危机并没有过去，1959年的生产将剧烈下降，出口也将减少。
    霍布斯10月14日在多伦多证券交易人俱乐部发表的谈话中指出，美国政府在现阶段经济危机中所采取的支持经济活动的人为措施，已经引起政府的预算赤字。这不过是暂时的兴奋剂，不会促进经济的长期高涨。他说，这并不排斥在本年今后几个月中，工业生产指数还会有些上升。但是，霍布斯指出，到1959年4月，工业生产指数将下降到1958年同期的最低点。当时联邦储备管理局发表的工业生产指数是一二六点（以1947到1949年为一百），即降到1954年10月以来的最低水平。而且，根据霍布斯的意见，到1959年4月，美国的工业生产可能急剧下降到一二零点，即1952年以来的最低点。
    霍布斯用下列各点来论证他的论断。
    第一，目前的事实都不能证明某些经济学家对1959年的投资额将大大增加的期望。统计数字证明，美国生产力的过剩是1937年以来最巨大的。因此，几乎可以断言，即使以全年来说，资本的支出将达到三百到三百一十亿美元，明年上半年美国的投资也将比1958年同期减少5—8％。支持这个结论的是这一事实：目前收到的机床订单比去年低50％，比1956年低70％。
    第二，在明年，美国政府大概不会像今年年初一样地对建筑工程拨款。即使银行提供信贷的条件和6至9月以前一样，1959年住宅抵押借款无论如何也要至少减掉10％，因为许多中心区的住宅已经过剩了。如果没有人为地放宽信贷条件，明年的住宅建筑将比今年减少15—20％。
    第三，已经有了这样的迹象：在选举以后的美国政府开支将削减，因为今年春季政府的订货额曾大大增加。
    第四，美国有支付能力的需求的低水平，阻碍了生产的扩大，而消费者的债务已经达到空前的高额，到本年8月底，消费信贷总额已达四百三十二亿美元。
    第五，由于许多国家的外汇情况恶化和许多其他原因，1959年的美国出口额将减少二十到四十亿美元，这将严重影响美国与出口有关的经济部门。
    第六，尽管商品的存货有些降低，但是为数还是很大。目前的存货额同销货额的比率指数，超过近十年来的平均水平。如果工业生产指数再一次达到一四○点，则存货的增长过程可能重演，而政府的削减采购将助长这种趋势。
    本报讯　美国“工人周报”11月23日载文说：美国在选举以前不断听到的某些“复苏”，只不过是政府发表的一些夸大了的数字而已。即使在政府的说法有根据的方面，也出现了上升趋势显著减缓的现象。
    第一花旗银行11月份的通讯在指出耐用品方面的“减缓”和“停顿”现象的时候说，“有些人问，最近的发展是否是重新下降的信号”。这个刊物并不认为是这样。“纽约时报”的经济问题分析员穆尼说：“复苏的初步现象并不完全像宣传的那样有力。关于国民生产毛值——所有产品和劳务的作值——的官方已发表的统计数字使情况看来好像是，衰退损失有四分之三到9月底已得到恢复。但是，把物价变动计算在内的未发表的估计认为，恢复的程度更接近三分之一”。
    文章还指出：经济学家预计，由于季节性因素的刺激，失业人数将有新的增加。“纽约时报”分析员也认为，预料在冬季几个月中，失业人数将从目前的三百八十万人增加到四百五十万人。
