    Ode to the Heroic People of Henan
    Qian Junrui
    This year, under the leadership of the Party, the people of our country have comprehensively launched “satellites” in all fields. Among them, there are five particularly large “satellites”: first, a multiplied increase in agricultural production; second, the mass campaign for iron and steel production by the whole people; third, the people's commune system; fourth, the arming of the entire population; and fifth, the cultural revolution movement combining cultural education with productive labor. They shine with golden light, not only marking the leap forward in our country's socialist construction and the accelerated preparation for the transition to communism, but also exerting a far-reaching influence on world peace and the cause of human progress. In these several movements of great significance, nearly 50 million people in Henan are all standing in the ranks of the advanced. We recently visited Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang, Xuchang, Dengfeng, Yuxian, Mengjin, and Sanmenxia and other places. The soaring enthusiasm and heroic spirit of the people of Henan are truly something we can only look up to with admiration. Therefore, this ode:
    Heroic people are spirited and high,
    Their ambition swallows mountains and rivers as they go to the battlefield.
    A million-strong army refines iron and steel,
    The steelmakers are even stronger than steel.
    High-yield “satellite” fields are everywhere,
    Deep plowing yields ten thousand catties of grain per mu.
    Everyone praises the "local Eighth Route Army,"
    Strutting and brimming with vigor.
    Thousands upon thousands of poems,
    Surpass the good writings of Li Bai and Du Fu.
    The people's commune is infinitely good,
    The light of communism is revealed.
    Poverty and blankness, what's so bad about them?
    Stir up enthusiasm, unmatched in the world!
    Fifty million people cooperate,
    Fifty million people rejoice.
    Happiness does not forget the root of happiness,
    Long live the red sun, the East!

    河南英雄人民赞
    钱俊瑞
    今年我国人民在党的领导下，全面大放卫星。其中有五颗特大卫星：一曰农业增产加番，二曰全民大办钢铁，三曰人民公社化，四曰全民皆兵，五曰文化教育和生产劳动相结合的文化革命运动，他们金光闪烁，不但标志着我国社会主义建设的飞跃前进和向共产主义过渡的加速准备，并且将对世界和平和人类进步事业发生极其深远的影响。在这几项具有重大意义的运动中，河南近五千万人民都站在先进的行列。我们最近历访郑州、开封、洛阳、许昌、登封、禹县、孟津和三门峡等地，对于河南人民的冲天干劲和英勇豪迈气概，真是仰之弥高，崇敬无已。因为赞，曰：
    英雄人民意气扬，
    气吞山河上战场。
    百万雄师炼钢铁，
    炼钢人比钢还强。
    处处高产卫星田，
    深翻亩打万斤粮。
    人人夸说“土八路”，
    雄赳赳来气昂昂。
    诗篇琳琅千万首，
    赛过李杜好文章。
    人民公社无限好，
    共产主义露光芒。
    一穷二白岂坏事？
    鼓起干劲世无双！
    五千万人齐协作，
    五千万人喜洋洋。
    幸福不忘幸福根，
    万岁东方红太阳！
