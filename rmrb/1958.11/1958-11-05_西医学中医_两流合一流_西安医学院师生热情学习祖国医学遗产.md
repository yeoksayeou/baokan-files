Xi'an, November 3rd (reporter from this newspaper) – At Xi'an Medical College, over four thousand teachers, students, and medical personnel from affiliated hospitals are launching a mass movement of "integrating Western and Chinese medicine" by studying Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Since the beginning of this semester, the school party committee has placed special emphasis on the work of studying and researching Chinese medicine and herbal remedies. Although there are only four TCM practitioners in the entire school, they give prominence to politics and everyone participates, adopting the method of doing what they learn, learning what they do, learning while using, improving while learning, starting from individual points to cover the whole area, and accumulating knowledge gradually, quickly pushing the "integration of Western and Chinese medicine" learning to a comprehensive blooming. In the past month, the number of diseases treated with TCM and herbal remedies in the school's two affiliated hospitals has reached 323, a ten-fold increase compared to the past. 90% of clinical department teachers and medical personnel have initially mastered the basic theory and techniques of acupuncture. According to their respective specialties, they are also learning and applying the treatment methods and prescriptions of TCM. Clinical teaching and research groups have formulated "integration of Western and Chinese medicine" treatment plans and are starting to compile TCM prescription manuals. Teachers are also actively conducting scientific research on replacing Western medicine with Chinese herbal remedies, putting forward the ambitious slogan "to make liver cancer surrender and high blood pressure bow its head."

Students are even more enthusiastic about learning the legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Recently, they have launched a widespread movement to collect secret and effective folk remedies. Fourth-year students in the medical department have begun to visit relatives, friends, and acquaintances, and send letters. Each of them will collect ten folk remedies or proven prescriptions within the year, and then compile them into a book. Many classes have automatically established committees for the integration of Western and Chinese medicine, and every dormitory has purchased acupuncture point charts and TCM magazines. Students are most interested in learning acupuncture, and some have bought needles and scrap electrical wire to practice on each other.

In this movement of "destroying the authority of bourgeois medicine and establishing the ambition of proletarian health," teachers and students of Xi'an Medical College have achieved good results in learning TCM and herbal remedies. A teacher in the Department of Basic Internal Medicine used the folk remedy "swollen half-section" for a patient in the degenerative phase of chronic nephritis. The patient took only a few doses of medicine, costing only five jiao (cents), and the edema of the limbs completely disappeared and he recovered. In the past, using the Western medicine "chlormethine," one course of treatment would cost 20 yuan, but the effect was very slow. They also used the inexpensive Chinese herbal medicine "berberine" to treat bacillary dysentery in clinical practice, and the effect was much better than the Western medicine "chloramphenicol."

Xi'an Medical College already had a certain foundation in learning TCM in the past. Last semester, teachers and students presented 110 teaching and research achievements in TCM and herbal remedies as gifts for National Day. However, at that time, learning TCM had not formed a mass movement. Many senior teaching and medical personnel had bourgeois academic thoughts and medical views such as valuing Western medicine and belittling Chinese medicine, revering foreign countries and despising China. They believed that Chinese herbal remedies were nothing more than bark and roots, without scientific basis and untrustworthy. They claimed that the therapeutic effect of TCM was accidental, citing reasons such as not enough cases or incomplete diagnoses. Starting in October this year, the Party Committee of Xi'an Medical College decided to remove the white flag and launch a mass debate among teachers and students to address these bourgeois ideas and viewpoints. The Basic Internal Medicine Teaching and Research Group originally planned to implement "integration of Western and Chinese medicine" within three years. After criticizing the erroneous ideas of doubting the efficacy of TCM, the hospitalized patients in all four wards under its management were treated with Chinese herbal remedies and acupuncture. The school-wide "integration of Western and Chinese medicine" movement quickly unfolded after the theoretical discussions turned into practical actions.

At the same time, the secretary of the school party committee went deep into the teaching and research groups and departments to help teachers and doctors summarize their experiences in learning TCM. The School immediately established a school-wide TCM learning promotion committee. The original teaching plan was also broken in the teaching, and systematic TCM courses were opened every year from the first grade. In addition, more than a dozen well-known TCM practitioners from outside the school were hired as instructors and consultants. According to the opinions discussed by the masses, the school put forward four specific requirements for the "integration of Western and Chinese medicine": First, every medical staff should master acupuncture techniques and learn the application of commonly used acupoints in their departments; Second, TCM and herbal remedies or integrated Chinese and Western medicine should be used to treat 60% of patients; Third, doctors at all levels should be able to read TCM books related to common diseases (about ten) in their departments, explain them with TCM theory, and prescribe Chinese herbal formulas for clinical treatment; Fourth, 60% of clinical lessons should use TCM theory to explain diseases, and basic courses should also appropriately link and teach relevant content.

Now, Xi'an Medical College, after a month of hard work, has basically completed the first two "integration" requirements. Teachers and students are continuing to carry out the struggle between the two roads of teaching and medical ideology, while actively studying the general theory of TCM, intensifying clinical observation and theoretical research of TCM and herbal remedies, and systematically collecting various data to summarize and improve, so that the current popularization of TCM knowledge and technology will rapidly move towards improvement.

    西医学中医　两流合一流
    西安医学院师生热情学习祖国医学遗产
    本报西安3日电　西安医学院近四千多教师、学生以及附属医院的医务人员，正展开一个群众性的西医学习中医的“中西合流”运动。
    这学期开始，学校党委对学习和研究中医中药这项工作特别重视，虽然全校只有四个中医，可是他们政治挂帅，人人动手，采取了做什么、学什么、边学、边用、边提高，由点到面，滴水成河的办法，很快使“中西合流”的学习推向全面开花。近一个月来，学校两个附属医院应用中医中药进行治疗的疾病，已达三百二十三种，比过去增长了十倍。90％的临床各科教师和医务人员，都已初步掌握了针灸的基本理论和技术操作，他们按自己不同专业科别，还在学习和应用中医的治疗法则和方剂。各临床教研组订出了“中西合流”治疗方案，分别正在着手编写中医处方手册。教师们还在积极进行用中药代替西药的科学研究，他们提出“要使肝癌投降，高血压低头”的豪迈口号。
    学生们对学习祖国医学遗产，更是热情。最近，他们广泛展开了收集秘方、验方的采风运动。医疗系四年级学生已分头向亲友、熟识者访问和发信，他们在年内每人将收集十个民间的秘方或验方，然后汇编出书。许多班级自动成立了中西医合流委员会，各个宿舍都购买了针灸穴位图和中医杂志。学生们对学习针灸最感兴趣，有的买了扎针和废电线互相练习操作。
    在这次“破资产阶级医学权威，立无产阶级卫生志气”的运动中，西安医学院师生学习中医中药已取得良好效果。基础内科教师为一个慢性肾炎变性期的患者，使用了民间秘方“肿半截”，病人仅吃了几服药，花了五角钱药费，肢体浮肿便全部消失痊愈了。而过去用西药“氯芥”，一个疗程的医药费就要二十元，疗效却很慢。他们在临床还用价格低廉的中药“小蘖碱”医治细菌性痢疾，疗效也大大超过西药“同霉素”。
    西安医学院过去对学习中医已有一定基础。上学期，师生们在中医中药方面拿出了一百一十项教学和科研成就，向国庆节献礼。可是，当时学习中医并没有形成群众性的运动。不少高级教学医疗人员存在着厚西薄中、重洋轻中、崇拜美英等资产阶级学术思想和医疗观点，他们认为中药不过是树皮草根，没有科学根据，不足置信，他们以病例不多或诊断不全为理由，称中医的治疗效果是带有偶然性的。今年十月开始，西安医学院党委决定拔掉白旗，针对这些资产阶级思想观点，发动广大师生群众鸣放辩论。基础内科教研组原来计划三年内实行“中西合流”，这次批判了怀疑中医疗效等错误思想后，所管四个病区的住院病人，全部采用了中药和针灸治疗。全校“中西合流”运动经过务虚论实很快展开了。
    同时，学校党委书记深入教研组和科室，帮助教师、医师总结学习中医的经验，立即成立了全校学习中医促进委员会。教学上也打破了原有教学计划，从一年级起每年都开设系统的中医课程，另外聘请了校外十几个著名中医担任辅导和顾问。根据群众讨论意见，学校并提出了“中西合流”的四大具体要求：一、每个医护人员都要掌握针灸技术，学会本科常用穴位的应用；二、在60％的病人中应用中医中药治疗或者中西兼治；三、各级医师对本科常见的疾病（十个左右）应该能够阅读与其有关的中医书籍，用中医理论加以解释后，开中药方剂临床治疗；四、临床课教学有60％的疾病运用祖国医学理论讲解，基础课也适当联系有关内容讲授。
    现在，西安医学院经过苦试一月，已基本完成了前两项“合流”要求，师生们一面在继续展开教学医疗思想两条道路的斗争，一面正在积极学习中医学概论，加紧中医中药的临床观察和理论探讨研究，系统收集各方面资料，加以总结和提高，使现阶段中医知识技术的普及迅速走向提高。
