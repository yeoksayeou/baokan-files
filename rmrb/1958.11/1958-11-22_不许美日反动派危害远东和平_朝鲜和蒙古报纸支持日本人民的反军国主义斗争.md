Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st. "Democratic Korea" published a commentary today stating that the purpose of the US imperialists and the Nobusuke Kishi government in revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty" runs counter to the Japanese people's rights to national autonomy and peace in the Far East.

The commentary said that the goal pursued by the US imperialists and the Nobusuke Kishi government in revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty" is to continue using Japan as a military base for aggression in Asia and to use the Japanese army as cannon fodder in wars of aggression. This will inevitably link Japan with military blocs such as the Atlantic and Southeast Asia, effectively realizing the "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" that has been planned for a long time.

The commentary emphasized that the Korean people, who have always supported the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy and hope that Japan will become a peace-loving and democratic country, once again warn the Nobusuke Kishi government that it must abandon the illusion of including Japan in the atomic strategic system to realize the impossible "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." It must abandon the hostile policy toward the Korean people and the unfriendly attitude toward the Chinese people manifested in the "Japan-South Korea Talks" and the issue of Korean residents in Japan. It should show sincerity in establishing good-neighborly relations with neighboring countries, especially Korea and China. If Nobusuke Kishi disregards this warning, colludes with US imperialism, and pursues a hostile policy toward neighboring countries, he will inevitably meet the fate of his old partner, Tojo.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 21st. The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published a commentary today stating that the Mongolian people support the Japanese people's struggle to embark on a path of peace and democracy.

The commentary said that due to the Nobusuke Kishi government's pursuit of a policy of external aggression and internal anti-people measures, the situation in Japan has deteriorated drastically. The US-Japan negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty" have aroused a tide of resistance from the Japanese people. Peace-loving people in all countries, like the Japanese people, demand the abolition of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" that harms the interests of the Japanese nation.

The commentary said that in order to suppress the Japanese people, the Nobusuke Kishi government is attempting to forcibly pass the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment," leading Japan down the dangerous path of a police state. However, the Nobusuke Kishi government's reactionary measures have been strongly opposed by the Japanese people, and the Japanese people are fighting to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government.

    不许美日反动派危害远东和平
    朝鲜和蒙古报纸支持日本人民的反军国主义斗争
    新华社平壤21日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论说，美帝国主义者和岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的目的是同日本的民族自主权利和远东和平背道而驰的。
    评论说，美帝国主义和岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”所追求的目的是，美国继续利用日本为侵略亚洲的军事基地并且将利用日本的军队作为侵略战争的炮灰，这必然使日本同大西洋和东南亚等军事集团联系起来，在实际上实现很久以来就在筹划的“东北亚军事同盟”。
    评论强调说，一向支持日本人民为独立、和平和民主的斗争并且希望日本成为爱好和平民主的国家的朝鲜人民，再一次向岸信介政府发出警告，必须放弃把日本列入原子战略体系以实现不可能实现的“大东亚共荣圈”的幻想，必须放弃在“日韩会谈”和旅日朝鲜侨民问题中所表现对朝鲜人民的敌对政策和对中国人民的不友好态度，应该表示诚意同邻邦首先是朝中两国建立善邻关系。如果，岸信介无视这一警告，勾结美帝国主义追求对邻邦的敌对政策，它必将遭到它的老伙伴东条的命运。
    新华社乌兰巴托21日电　蒙古“真理报”今天发表的一篇评论说，蒙古人民支持日本人民为走上和平民主的道路而进行的斗争。
    评论说，由于岸信介政府奉行对外侵略、对内反人民的政策，日本局势因之极端恶化。日美关于修改“安全条约”的谈判引起了日本人民的反抗怒潮，爱好和平的各国公众同日本人民一样，要求废除损害日本民族利益的日美“安全条约”。
    评论说，岸信介政府为了镇压日本人民，企图强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”，使日本走上警察国家的危险道路。但是，岸信介政府的反动措施遭到了日本人民的强烈反对，日本人民正在为打倒岸信介政府进行着斗争。
