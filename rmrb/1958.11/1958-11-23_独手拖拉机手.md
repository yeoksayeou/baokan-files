    One-Armed Tractor Driver

    When you mention Zhang Taoxian, the one-armed female tractor driver from Jiangkou County, Guizhou Province, she is well-known far and wide.

    When Zhang Taoxian was little, because no one took care of her, her left hand was burned and became disabled, leaving her with only one hand. However, the happy life in the new society encouraged her. She didn't become pessimistic or disappointed, but instead, she boosted her spirits, overcame all kinds of difficulties, and became a production expert. Whether it was promoting new farm tools or cutting grass, she always strived to be the best.

    In May of this year, the county decided to bring in eight tractors and train dozens of tractor drivers within the year. From that moment on, Zhang Taoxian often thought, "How wonderful it would be if I could learn to drive a tractor!" But she also felt that driving a tractor was much more difficult than using a double-wheeled double-shared plow or cutting grass and working. She was afraid that she couldn't do it, and even more afraid that the leadership wouldn't approve her to study. As expected, the county tractor training class didn't call her to go, and she felt both envious and sad. But she knew that it wasn't that the Party didn't want to train her, but that the leading comrades were concerned about her, afraid that her body couldn't handle it, and afraid that she couldn't move the machine with one hand. The more she thought about these things, the sadder she became. After the township knew about it, Branch Secretary Yang and Township Head Huang came to persuade her, encouraging her to concentrate on production at home. She felt very sad, hating herself for only having one hand, but she still requested to go to study. The township contacted the county Party committee and the county Communist Youth League several times, and the county finally decided to let her try. Zhang Taoxian happily ran to the county. On the way, she met Baolan, who had just arrived at the tractor school the day before. She hurriedly asked, "Baolan, does the tractor have two turntables or one turntable, and can it be operated with one hand?" Baolan told her that there was only one steering wheel and encouraged her to try. Only then did Taoxian feel relieved and ran all the way to the county. "Wow, such a big machine, so many parts, can I do it?" She looked at the machine for a long time, a little worried. The next day, she found Master Dai by herself. Master Dai encouraged her, saying that she could learn it, and said that the county Party committee had already told driver Wang a few days ago to be responsible for teaching her. During the learning process, she found it very difficult because she only had one hand. Others could do an action in one or two tries, but she had to do it three or four times, or even more, before she could master it. Although there were many difficulties, she didn't lose heart or become discouraged. Finally, with the support of the Party, the patient help of the master, and the encouragement of her classmates, after more than ten days of hard study and hard work, she learned to drive a tractor.

    独手拖拉机手
    提起了贵州省江口县独手女拖拉机手章桃仙，真是远近皆知。
    章桃仙小的时候因为没人照管，左手被烧成了残废，只剩下一只手。但是，新社会的幸福生活鼓舞了她，她不悲观失望，相反地却鼓起干劲，克服了种种困难，成为生产中的好手。无论是推广新式农具或割草，她都争得了上游。
    今年5月间，县里决定调来八部拖拉机，在今年内要培养几十名拖拉机手。从那时起，章桃仙经常在想：“要是能学会开拖拉机该有多好！”可是她又觉得开拖拉机比用双轮双铧犁，比割草、干活要困难得多，怕自己不行，更怕领导上批不准去学习。果真县里拖拉机训练班没有调她去，她心中又羡慕又难过。可是她知道不是党不愿意培养她，而是领导同志在关心她，怕她去后身体吃不消，怕一只手搬不动机器，愈想这些她就愈难过。乡里知道后，杨支书和黄乡长都来劝她，鼓励她安心在家生产。她心里很难过，恨自己只有一只手，可是她还是要求去学习。乡里好几次给县委和团县委联系，县里最后决定让她去试试看。章桃仙就高高兴兴地往县里跑。在路上碰见了头天刚到拖拉机学校的宝兰，她忙问：“宝兰，拖拉机是两个转盘还是一个转盘，能不能合起来用一只手开？”宝兰告诉她只有一个方向盘，并鼓励她去试试。桃仙这才放心，一口气跑到县里。“呀，这么大的机器，这么多零件，能行吗？”她把机器看了好久，有点耽心。第二天她一个人找到了戴师傅，戴师傅鼓励她，说她能学会，并且说：县委在前两天已经告诉了王司机，请他负责教会。在学习中，她因为只有一只手，感到很吃力，人家一个动作一二遍就能做了，她得三四次以至更多的次数才能掌握。虽然困难多，但她不灰心气馁。终于在党的支持、师傅的耐心帮助和同学们的鼓励下，经过十多天的苦学苦钻，学会驾驶拖拉机了。
