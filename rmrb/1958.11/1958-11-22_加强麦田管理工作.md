Strengthen Wheat Field Management

The sowing of wheat, rapeseed, and other crops across the country has essentially concluded, except in some southern regions. Grasping field management, particularly wheat field management, has become one of the most important tasks in current agricultural activities. We know that an important experience in striving for a bumper summer harvest this year was strengthening field management. This year's summer harvest crops were inherently deficient to begin with, but by strengthening later-stage management, we achieved leaps in production, increasing yields by tens of percent, hundreds of percent, or even two hundred percent compared to 1957. If early-stage management had been strengthened, the increase would have been even greater.

Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "The task for agriculture in 1959 should be a greater leap forward than in 1958." This means that the development of agriculture next year should take another leap based on this year's Great Leap Forward. A greater leap forward in next year's summer harvest crops, especially wheat production, will play a decisive role in ensuring a greater leap forward in overall agricultural production next year. We know that this year's autumn sowing (including winter planting) covers approximately 500 million mu of grain, of which more than 370 million mu are winter wheat. If we strive for a yield of 1,000 jin of wheat per mu, the total output of summer harvest crops will reach 500 billion jin, greatly exceeding the total grain output for the entire year of 1957, and equivalent to more than half of this year's total grain output. This is, of course, a pivotal figure for completing the task of a greater leap forward in grain production for the entire year next year. A great leap forward in summer harvest crops, especially wheat, will also greatly promote autumn crops. This year's bumper summer harvest, especially the emergence of high-yield wheat "satellite fields" with yields of several thousand jin per mu, sparked a leaping tide of "early rice catching up with wheat" and "late rice catching up with early rice" in summer and autumn production in various regions, resulting in unprecedented high yields for autumn crops as well.

So, is a greater leap forward possible for next year's wheat and other summer harvest crops? It is entirely possible, not only because the sowing quality this year is much better than last year, but also because there is still great potential for increasing wheat production. This year's bumper summer harvest and the emergence of high-yield wheat satellites have proven, on the one hand, that wheat is not a low-yield crop and that wheat yields can be greatly increased. On the other hand, although many high-yield satellites have appeared for wheat, it still lags behind other grain crops in terms of yield per unit area. Nationally, the average yield of wheat per unit area is still less than one-third of the rice yield per mu, only slightly more than half of the corn yield per mu, and even 30 to 40 percent lower than the yields of millet and sorghum per mu. It is clear that wheat production still needs to leap forward and is capable of a greater leap forward. To turn need and possibility into reality, the key lies in strengthening wheat field management from beginning to end. Like a mother protecting her child, we must protect it from sowing until it matures. The more diligent and meticulous the field management, the higher the yield will be. How much labor you give it is how much grain it will give you.

The primary key to doing a good job in early wheat field management is topdressing and watering. Doing these two things well will ensure that the soil has sufficient moisture and rich nutrients, and wheat tillering can be increased. According to experimental observations on topdressing seedling fertilizer for wheat by agricultural science departments, winter topdressing resulted in 2.45 tillers per plant, while no seedling fertilizer resulted in 1.69 tillers per plant. The degree of wheat yield increase is closely related to the number of ears, and the number of ears depends on the number of effective tillers. When An'guo County, Hebei Province, was debating the issue of strengthening early wheat field management, someone calculated that if early processing and management of wheat fields could increase the number of effective tillers by 100,000 per mu, it could increase wheat production by 400 jin. Another situation particularly worth noting this year is that in a few areas, due to deep plowing and close planting without sufficient fertilizer, wheat seedlings have shown signs of yellowing. Therefore, strengthening field management is even more important. Winter irrigation has the effect of storing water and retaining warmth. All areas with suitable conditions should irrigate once before freezing. According to the results of winter irrigation experiments conducted by the masses in Wugong, Xingping, and other places in Shaanxi Province over the years: early winter irrigation results in more tillering, more and deeper roots, and stronger growth of wheat seedlings, with an average yield increase of 16% to 20% per mu. After irrigation, weeding, pressing, and harrowing of wheat should be carried out in a timely manner to prevent crusting and cracking, conserve moisture, prevent cold, and protect seedlings.

In order to resolutely eliminate the three types of seedlings in the seedling stage, early management work must also be done well. We must ensure that every inch of land is utilized and every seedling is nurtured, guaranteeing that each plant is strong and each plot is uniform, increasing the ability to resist adverse environments. For poorly growing wheat seedlings, fertilizer and water should be applied simultaneously to promote the weak to catch up with the strong, and the late to catch up with the early, resolutely eliminating the three types of seedlings in the seedling stage, striving to transform first and second-class fields into high-yield fields, and transform high-yield fields into ultra-high-yield fields. In areas with underground pests, effective measures should be taken to control and treat them, laying a solid foundation for achieving even greater harvests.

Managing large-area high-yield "satellite fields" is the focus of wheat field management in various regions. Ensuring that more than 10% of the total wheat sown area consists of large-area satellite fields with yields of 3,000 jin, 5,000 jin, or even 10,000 jin per mu is a fundamental key to a greater leap forward in production next year. Of course, while ensuring the management of more than 10% of high-yield satellite fields, the remaining 80% of general fields must also be well managed, combining high-yield production with comprehensive production. According to the experience of this year's bumper summer harvest, to ensure a leap forward in next year's summer crops, we need to continue to break superstitions and liberate our thinking. Although the fact of this year's bumper summer harvest has already refuted all pessimistic arguments such as the "low wheat yield theory," not everyone is confident in achieving the targets of an average wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu nationwide and yields of 3,000 jin to 10,000 jin per mu on more than 10% of the cultivated land. Some people still express doubts about this, and some even oppose it. They say: This is bragging! This is a dream! Some people admit that these targets may be achieved, but believe that the effort and cost are too great and not worthwhile. We must criticize these ideas. Only in this way can next year's wheat yield increase targets be realized; and only in this way will everyone pay attention to strengthening wheat field management this winter.

Among many farmers, there is also a habit of not paying much attention to early wheat field management. They are not convinced of the benefits of strengthening early wheat field management, especially winter topdressing and watering. They say: "We have been farming for eight hundred generations and have never heard of fertilizing or watering wheat in winter." This requires a series of concrete facts to illustrate the benefits of strengthening early wheat field management.

At present, autumn harvesting has not yet been fully completed, farmland water conservancy construction has already begun, and adding early wheat field management, the labor force is very tight. Therefore, a comprehensive arrangement must be made for the labor force; otherwise, wheat field management will be squeezed out. After the end of autumn sowing, An'guo County, Hebei Province, immediately formulated a plan for managing high-yield wheat satellite fields and general fields, classified and ranked all wheat fields, organized professional teams to be responsible for management according to various situations, and launched a free airing and debate on how to do a good job in wheat field management, focusing on ensuring full and strong seedlings, and criticizing the old ways. In terms of management measures, they focused on applying seedling fertilizer to ensure full seedlings, irrigating to protect seedlings (irrigating once before freezing in winter), and applying winter fertilizer (fertilizing in the twelfth lunar month) to ensure that wheat seedlings safely overwinter. Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, adopted the method of "inspecting and supplementing as soon as it appears" for early wheat field management, proposing "a missing seedling is a large blank space, and a broken furrow is three inches without seedlings." Mobilizing an army of 45,000 seedling checkers completed the replanting in two days. In order to further strengthen wheat field management, 50,000 wheat field management professional teams were organized, adopting measures of "fixed time, fixed personnel, fixed plots, and fixed quality." As of early November, more than 360,000 mu of wheat fields in the county's 500,000 mu of wheat fields had been topdressed, and more than 190,000 mu of wheat fields had been irrigated.

The above analysis shows that to do a good job in wheat field management, the Party committee secretary must personally take command and bring this work onto the Party committee's agenda. Wheat field management is indeed a technical task, but without political guarantees, it cannot be done well. This year's experience has already shown this. From now until March next year, there are still more than four months. In these four months, the first secretaries of Party committees at all levels must grasp the field management of summer crops like they did with steel and grain in the past, ensuring that this work is done quickly, well, and in great quantity.

    加强麦田管理工作
    全国小麦、油菜等作物的播种工作，除南方一部分地区以外已基本结束。抓紧田间管理，特别是麦田管理，成了当前农事活动中一个最重要的课题。我们知道，今年各地争取夏季大丰收的一个重要经验，就是加强田间管理。今年的夏收作物本来是先天不足的，因为加强了后期管理，就获得了比1957年增产百分之几十、百分之一百、百分之二百的跃进；如果加强早期管理，增产还会更高。
    毛泽东同志曾经指出：“1959年农业方面的任务，应当比1958年有一个更大的跃进”。这就是说，明年农业的发展，应当在今年大跃进的基础上，再来一个飞跃。而明年夏收作物，特别是小麦生产的更大跃进，对保证明年农业生产的更大跃进有决定性的作用。我们知道，今年秋播（包括冬种）粮食面积约五亿亩，其中冬小麦有三亿七千多万亩。如果争取每亩产麦一千斤，夏收作物的总产量就达五千亿斤，大大超过1957年全年的粮食产量，相当于今年全年粮食产量的半数以上。这对于完成明年全年的粮食生产更大跃进的任务，当然是一个举足轻重的数字。夏收作物特别是小麦的大跃进，对于秋季作物还有很大促进作用。今年夏季大丰收，特别是亩产几千斤的小麦卫星田的出现，使各地在夏秋生产中掀起了“早稻赶小麦”，“晚稻赶早稻”的跃进高潮，这样，秋季作物也得到空前的丰产。
    那么，明年的小麦以及其他夏收作物的更大跃进可不可能呢？完全可能，这不仅因为今年播种质量比去年好得多，而且因为小麦增产还有很大潜力。今年夏季大丰收和小麦高产卫星的出现，一方面证明了小麦不是低产作物，小麦产量还可以大大提高；另一面，小麦虽然出现不少高产卫星，但与其他粮食作物的单位面积产量比较起来，还是落后的。就全国来说，小麦的平均单位面积产量还不到水稻亩产量的三分之一，仅及玉米亩产量的二分之一强，比起谷子、高粱的亩产量也低百分之三、四十。可见小麦产量还需要跃进，也可能有更大的跃进。要使需要与可能变成现实，关键就在于从头到尾自始至终地加强麦田管理。就像母亲保护自己孩子一样，从下种一直保护到它成熟。田间管理愈是勤快，愈是细致，产量就会愈高。你给它多少劳动，它就给你多少粮食。
    做好麦田早期管理工作的首要关键，就是追肥和浇水。做好这两项工作，土壤中的水分充足，养分丰富，小麦的分蘖就可增多。根据农业科学部门对小麦施追苗肥的试验观察，冬季施追苗肥的，每株分蘖二点四五个，不施苗肥的每株分蘖一点六九个。小麦增产的程度和穗数关系很大，而穗数多少又决定于有效分蘖的多少。河北安国县在辩论加强麦田早期管理问题的时候，有人算了一笔账：如果及早对麦田进行加工管理，以每亩增加有效分蘖十万株计算，就可以增产麦子四百斤。今年还有一个特别值得注意的情况，少数地区由于深耕密植以后，肥料配合不上，麦苗已有发黄现象，因此，加强田间管理就显得更加重要。冬灌有蓄水保温的作用。凡是有条件的地区，都应当在上冻以前浇一次封冻水。据陕西省武功、兴平等地的群众历年来所做的冬灌试验结果：早冬灌比晚冬灌的麦苗分蘖多，根多根深，生长健壮，每亩产量平均高出16％到20％。浇灌后要适时进行锄麦、压麦、耱，这样，既能防止发生板结裂缝现象，又能保墒、防寒、保苗。
    为了坚决把三类苗消灭在幼苗阶段，也必须做好早期管理工作。做到寸土不让，棵苗必争，保证株株健壮，块块整齐，增加抵抗不良环境的能力。对于生长不好的麦苗，应当边施肥，边浇水，促进弱赶强，晚赶早，把三类苗坚决消灭在幼苗阶段，力争变一二类田为丰产田，变丰产田为高产田。有地下害虫的地区，要采取有效措施进行除治，为争取更大的丰收打下坚实的基础。
    管理好大面积高产卫星田是各地麦田管理的重点。保证小麦总播种面积内有10％以上的亩产三千斤、五千斤到一万斤的大面积的卫星田，这是明年生产更大跃进的一个根本关键。当然，既要保证管好10％以上的高产卫星田，其余80％以上的一般田也要管好，把高额丰产和全面丰产结合起来。根据今年夏季作物大丰收的经验，要保证明年夏季作物有一个飞跃的发展，就需要继续破除迷信，解放思想。虽然今年夏季作物大丰收的事实已经驳倒了“小麦低产论”等一切悲观论调，但是对于争取全国小麦平均亩产一千斤和10％以上的耕地亩产三千斤到一万斤的指标，并不是所有人都是信心很足的，其中还有些人对此表示怀疑，还有些人甚至表示反对。他们说：这是吹牛！这是梦想！也有人承认这些指标可能达到，但认为花的功本太大，不合算。对于这些思想，我们还必须进行批判。只有这样，明年的小麦增产指标才能实现；也只有这样，大家才会注意去加强今冬的麦田管理工作。
    在许多农民中，还有这样一种习惯，对麦田早期管理工作不大注意。他们对于麦田早期管理特别是冬季追肥、浇水，不大想得通。他们说：“种了八百辈子的地，也没听说麦子在冬天就要追肥、浇水。”这样就需要通过一系列具体事实，来说明加强麦田早期管理的好处。
    目前秋收工作尚未全部结束，农田水利建设已经开始，再加上一项麦田早期管理工作，劳动力是很紧张的。因此，对劳动力必须作全面安排；否则，就会挤掉麦田管理工作。河北省安国县在秋种结束后，马上做出管理小麦高产卫星田和一般田的规划，把所有麦田进行一次分类排队，根据各种情况组织专业队负责管理，并围绕保证苗全苗壮为中心，开展如何做好麦田管理的鸣放辩论，批判了老一套的做法。在管理措施上，大抓施追苗肥、保证全苗，浇保苗水（冬前浇一次封冻水），施冬肥（腊月施肥），保证麦苗安全越冬。山东省寿张县对早期麦田管理，采取“随出、随查、随补”的办法，提出“杯大空白为缺苗，三寸无苗为断垅”。发动四万五千查苗大军两天补完。为了进一步加强麦田管理，组织了五万个麦田管理专业队，采取“定时间、定人员、定地块、定质量”的措施，全县五十万亩麦田，截至11月上旬，已经施追肥的麦田达到三十六万多亩，浇灌麦田十九万多亩。
    上述分析，说明了要做好麦田管理工作，必须党委书记亲自挂帅，必须把这一工作提到党委议事日程上来。麦田管理工作的确是个技术性的工作，但是没有政治来保证，是做不好的。今年已有这样的经验。从现在到明年3月还有四个多月，在这四个多月里，各级党委第一书记必须像过去抓钢铁、粮食一样来抓夏季作物的田间管理工作，保证这一工作做得又多又快又好。
