    Despise Imperialism and All Reactionaries
    The publication of the important document "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries are Paper Tigers" is a matter of great political significance. After the publication of this document, it immediately aroused widespread attention from factories, rural areas, institutions, troops, schools, newspapers, and people from all walks of life across the country, and formed a new upsurge of learning throughout the country. Judging from the discussions of this document in various places, the scope of the discussion is very extensive. It includes major issues such as the inevitable victory of newborn forces over decadent forces, the relationship between the victory of the Chinese revolution and Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic thinking, the ebb and flow of revolutionary forces versus counter-revolutionary forces in the Chinese revolutionary struggle, the Chinese people's opposition to US imperialist aggression and the liberation of Taiwan, the significance of accelerating China's socialist economic construction, the comparison of strength between the two camps and the prospects for development, and the development of national independence movements. The study and discussion of this document has greatly enhanced the political understanding of the Chinese people, further inspired their fighting spirit, and promoted the revolutionary spirit of despising imperialism and all reactionaries.
    At present, the struggle of people all over the world against imperialism, mainly the struggle against US imperialist aggression and oppression, is developing vigorously. Although the US imperialist policy of "strength" and "brinkmanship" has failed, and its aggressive activities have been resolutely resisted by people of all countries and have repeatedly failed, it is still baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, moving fleets around, wielding atomic weapons, and intimidating and threatening people of all countries. Under these circumstances, it is very important for the people of the world not to be deceived by the superficial bluster of the imperialist reactionaries, but to see clearly from the essence that they are nothing but "paper tigers". Only by recognizing that US imperialism is acting fiercely everywhere, showing off its power, is merely a manifestation of its being outwardly strong but inwardly weak, can we greatly enhance our confidence and courage in the struggle, correctly arrange our strategic plans, and guide the people to advance victoriously. The conclusion that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" is our sharpest ideological weapon to defeat imperialism and all reactionaries.
    Our era is an era full of revolutionary struggles and revolutionary victories, an era in which newborn revolutionary forces constantly defeat decadent reactionary forces. The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution opened up a brand new era for mankind's transition from capitalism to socialism. From that time until now, although it has only been a short forty-one years, the face of the world has undergone earth-shaking changes. Socialism has transcended the scope of one country and developed into a powerful socialist camp with nearly one billion people. The anti-imperialist national revolutionary movement is flourishing in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Socialist forces and national revolutionary forces are converging into an irresistible historical torrent, fiercely impacting the final rule of imperialist reactionary forces. On the imperialist side, the situation is completely the opposite. The entire imperialist camp cannot escape the economic crisis, and the situation of US imperialism is particularly serious. The reactionary forces in some countries supported by the United States have embarked on the path of fascism and military dictatorship because they cannot solve the deepening political and revolutionary crises. This does not indicate the strength of imperialism and these reactionaries; on the contrary, it is a manifestation of their increasing weakness and a sign of their final failure and death.
    Imperialism and all reactionaries are about to die. It should be the imperialist reactionaries who are afraid of the revolutionary forces, not the revolutionary forces who are afraid of the imperialist reactionaries. However, even now, many people overestimate the strength of the imperialist reactionaries and underestimate the revolutionary forces of the people. They only see the superficial strength of the imperialist reactionaries, but they do not see the essential weakness of the imperialist reactionaries. They only see the phenomenon that the development of people's forces is temporarily slow in some places, but they do not see that the people are awakening and uniting, and will eventually overthrow all oppression and achieve final victory. They only see that some places under the rule of reactionary forces still maintain a superficial calm, but they do not see that the flames of the people in those places are running underground, and will eventually erupt suddenly and completely bury those decadent forces. All these views are extremely wrong. These views can only enhance the enemy's prestige and diminish our own ambition, which is detrimental to the people's revolutionary cause.
    Now, some people still think that the West is advanced and the East is backward. This is superstition! The fact is just the opposite. The West has long been backward, and the East is advanced. Lenin asserted long ago that Asia would run ahead of Europe. Now, the socialist camp is magnificent and unparalleled, Asia, Africa, and Latin America are bright, while the Western imperialist world is precarious. The imperialist West is the setting sun of the afternoon, while the socialist and nationalist East is the rising sun of the morning. May I ask: which aspect of the Western imperialist countries can be called advanced? Can they be called advanced for maintaining the criminal social system of man exploiting man and man oppressing man? Can they be called advanced for invading and plundering the people of other countries and suppressing the national independence movements of other countries? Can their science and technology, serving the purpose of war, for the benefit of a few, and fundamentally unable to benefit the people, be called advanced? They have reached a dead end of being separated from the people in culture, full of decadence and despair, and have even developed to the point where chimpanzees have become "art masters." Can this be called advanced? They are backward, they have low tastes, and all revolutionary people have every reason to despise them.
    Now, some people still think that the strength of the West cannot be underestimated. This is also superstition! Western imperialism is not only resisted by the people of all countries in the world, but also opposed by the people of their own countries. Their internal affairs are disintegrating, and they do not receive the support of the people. Their so-called power is built on sand. Their so-called strength is nothing more than some steel plus a few atomic bombs. US imperialism is precisely using these things to scare others. However, Marxists-Leninists have always believed that what ultimately determines the victory or defeat of a war is not weapons, but the people who wield them. Moreover, the United States is not the only country that possesses nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union has long mastered this weapon, and the United States has fallen far behind the Soviet Union in certain military science and technology, such as intercontinental missiles. As for steel, it is even less frightening. Not only is steel not the only factor determining the balance of power, but the advantage in steel production that the United States and the imperialist camp have over the Soviet Union and the socialist camp will soon disappear. Both "weapon-only theory" and "steel-only theory" are completely untenable.
    Now, some people still think that it is best not to provoke US imperialism. Provoking it will make it even more mad and will be detrimental to world peace. But the question is: who is provoking whom? Does the United States interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries, invade the territory of other countries, and force the establishment of military bases in other countries, isn't this "provoking" others? If all the people in the world who are invaded and oppressed stand up to stop it, oppose it, and drive it away, if this is also called provocation, then what's wrong with this kind of provocation? Is it possible to achieve peace by not stopping it, not opposing it, and not driving it away? Of course it is impossible to achieve peace. On the contrary, the result will only be to condone aggression and make the imperialist reactionaries even more rampant. In fact, reactionaries are always reactionaries, and imperialism is always imperialism. Even if you don't provoke it, it will always provoke you. US imperialism's expansion and aggression around the world is not due to someone provoking it. For any aggressive activity of US imperialism, only by carrying out a resolute struggle against it and breaking its aggressive claws can true peace be established. It is not possible to be afraid of provoking imperialism.
    From the perspective of the overall situation of the struggle, from the perspective of the development of the balance of power, from the perspective of the essence of things, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and the revolutionary people have every reason to despise them. However, in the actual struggle against imperialism and in specific issues, the revolutionary people should also pay attention to the enemy, concentrate their forces to fight, and ensure victory. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "In order to fight against the enemy, we have formed a concept over a long period of time, that is, we must despise all enemies strategically and we must value all enemies tactically. That is to say, we must despise it as a whole, and we must value it on each and every specific issue." Moreover, the closer the imperialist reactionaries are to death, the more desperately they will struggle. Revolutionary people and peace forces must remain vigilant and bury the imperialist reactionaries in the graves they have dug themselves when they go crazy.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's great strategic thinking that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" and his brilliant conclusion that revolutionary forces will surely win and reactionary forces will surely fail have been proven by the great victory of the Chinese revolution and by a series of great victories in the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism. This is an invincible Marxist-Leninist ideological weapon. All of us Chinese people must continue to study in depth, use this brilliant thinking of Comrade Mao Zedong to better arm ourselves, and make greater contributions and strive for greater victories in developing the Chinese revolution, defending world peace, and ending the struggle against imperialism.

### 藐视帝国主义和一切反动派

    藐视帝国主义和一切反动派
    “毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的重要文献的发表，是一件有重大政治意义的事。这个文献发表之后，立即引起了全国各地工厂、农村、机关、部队、学校、报纸以及各界人士的广泛的重视，并且在全国范围内形成了一个新的学习热潮。从各地讨论这个文献的情况看来，讨论涉及的范围十分广泛。其中包括新生力量一定战胜腐朽力量，中国革命胜利同毛泽东同志的战略思想的关系，中国革命斗争中革命力量与反革命势力的消长，中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略和解放台湾的问题，加速我国社会主义经济建设的意义，两个阵营力量的对比和发展前途，民族独立运动的发展等等重大问题。对这个文献的学习和讨论，使我国人民大大提高了政治认识，进一步振奋了斗争精神，发扬了藐视帝国主义和一切反动派的革命气概。
    目前世界各国人民反对帝国主义的斗争，主要是反对美帝国主义侵略和压迫的斗争，正在汹涌澎湃地发展着。尽管美帝国主义的“实力地位”政策和“战争边缘”政策已经破产，它的侵略活动已经遭到各国人民的坚决反抗而一再失败，但是它仍在张牙舞爪，把舰队调来调去，挥弄原子武器，向各国人民进行恫吓和威胁。在这种情况下，对于全世界人民来说，不为帝国主义反动派表面上的虚张声势所迷惑，而从本质上看清楚它不过是“纸老虎”，这是十分重要的。只有认清楚美帝国主义到处逞凶，扬武耀威，不过是它外强中干的表现，才能大大地增强我们的斗争信心和勇气，才能正确地布置我们的战略计划，引导人民胜利前进。“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”这个论断，就是我们战胜帝国主义和一切反动派的最锐利的思想武器。
    我们这个时代，是充满着革命斗争和革命胜利的时代，是新生的革命力量不断战胜腐朽的反动力量的时代。伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，开辟了人类由资本主义过渡到社会主义的一个崭新的时代。从那个时候到现在，虽然还只有短短的四十一个年头，但是世界的面貌却已起了翻天覆地的变化。社会主义已经超越了一国范围，发展成为拥有近十亿人口的强大的社会主义阵营。反帝的民族革命运动，正在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲蓬勃发展。社会主义力量和民族革命力量正汇成莫之能御的历史洪流，猛烈地冲击着帝国主义反动势力的最后统治。在帝国主义方面，情况完全相反。整个帝国主义阵营无法摆脱经济危机，美帝国主义的情况尤其严重。美国所支持的某些国家的反动力量，由于无法解决日益加深的政治危机和革命危机，走上了法西斯化和军事独裁的道路。这并不是表示帝国主义和这些反动派的强大，恰恰相反，这是他们日益衰弱的表现，是他们走向最后失败和死亡的标志。
    帝国主义和一切反动派快要完蛋了。应当是帝国主义反动派害怕革命力量，而不是革命力量害怕帝国主义反动派。可是，直到现在，还有许多人对帝国主义反动派的力量估计过高，对人民的革命力量估计过低。他们只看到帝国主义反动派表面上的强大，而看不到帝国主义反动派实质上的虚弱。他们只看到人民力量的发展在某些地方暂时还是缓慢的现象，而看不到人民正在觉醒和团结起来，终将推翻一切压迫，取得最后胜利。他们只看到反动势力统治下的某些地方暂时还保持着表面的平静，而看不到那些地方人民的烈火正在地下运行，终将突然爆发，彻底埋葬那些腐朽的势力。所有这些看法，都是极端错误的。这些看法，只能长敌人的威风，灭自己的志气，对人民的革命事业是不利的。
    现在，有些人还以为，西方是先进的，东方是落后的。这是迷信！事实恰恰相反，西方早已落后了，东方才是先进的。列宁早就断言，亚洲将要跑在欧洲的前面。现在，社会主义阵营雄伟无比，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲一片光明，而西方帝国主义世界却是风雨飘摇。帝国主义西方是下午的没落的太阳，而社会主义和民族主义的东方则是早晨的上升的太阳。试问：西方帝国主义国家究竟有哪一点称得起先进呢？它们保持人剥削人，人压迫人的罪恶社会制度，能称得起先进吗？它们侵略和掠夺别国人民，镇压别国的民族独立运动，能称得起先进吗？它们的科学技术，服务于战争的目的，为了少数人的利益，根本不能造福于人民，能称得起先进吗？它们在文化上已经走到了脱离人民的绝境，充满着颓废和绝望，以至发展到猩猩成为“艺术大师”，这能叫做先进吗？它们是落后的，是低级趣味的，一切革命的人民完全有理由鄙视它们。
    现在，有些人还以为，西方的实力不可小看。这同样是迷信！西方帝国主义不仅遭到全世界各国人民的反抗，而且也遭到它们本国人民的反对。他们的内部是分崩离析的，他们得不到人民的支持。他们的所谓力量是建筑在沙滩上的。它们的所谓实力，无非是一些钢铁再加上几颗原子弹。美帝国主义就正是拿着这些东西来吓唬别人的。但是，马克思列宁主义者从来就认为，最后决定战争胜败的不是武器，而是掌握武器的人。何况，现在拥有核武器的并不只有美国，苏联也早就掌握了这种武器，而且在某些军事科学技术方面，例如在洲际导弹方面，美国已经远远落后于苏联。至于钢铁，更吓唬不了人。不但钢铁不是决定力量对比的唯一因素，而且美国和帝国主义阵营对于苏联和社会主义阵营所具有的钢铁生产的优势，很快就会消失了。“唯武器论”和“唯钢铁论”都是完全站不住脚的。
    现在，还有些人认为，对美帝国主义，最好不要刺激它，刺激了它，就会使它更加疯狂，对世界和平不利。但是，问题在于：究竟谁在刺激谁？美国干涉别国内政，侵犯别国主权，侵略别国领土，强迫在别国建立军事基地，这难道不是它在“刺激”别人吗？全世界一切被侵略被压迫的人民起来制止它，反对它，赶走它，如果这也叫做刺激的话，那末，这种刺激有什么不好呢？难道不制止它，不反对它，不赶走它，就会取得和平吗？当然不可能得到和平，相反地，其结果只能纵容侵略，使帝国主义反动派更加猖狂。其实，反动派总是反动派，帝国主义总是帝国主义，就是你不刺激它，它也总是要刺激你的。美帝国主义在全世界到处扩张侵略，并不是有人刺激了它的缘故。对于美帝国主义的任何侵略活动，只有同它进行坚决的斗争，打断它的侵略魔爪，才能确立真正的和平。怕刺激帝国主义是不行的。
    从斗争的全局来看，从力量对比的发展来看，从事物的本质来看，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，革命人民完全有理由加以藐视。但是，革命人民在反对帝国主义的实际斗争中和具体问题上，又应当重视敌人，集中力量进行战斗，保证赢得胜利。毛泽东同志告诉我们：“为了同敌人作斗争，我们在一个长时间内形成了一个概念，就是说，在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。也就是说在整体上我们一定要藐视它，在一个一个的具体问题上我们一定要重视它。”而且，帝国主义反动派愈是临近死亡，它们愈要拼命挣扎。革命人民和和平力量必须保持警惕，在帝国主义反动派一旦发疯的时候，就把它们埋葬到自己挖掘的坟墓里去。
    毛泽东同志关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的伟大的战略思想，关于革命力量一定胜利和反动力量一定失败的英明论断，已经为中国革命的伟大胜利所证明，也已经为世界人民反对帝国主义斗争的一系列伟大胜利所证明。这是一个战无不胜的、马克思列宁主义的思想武器。我们全中国人民一定要继续深入地进行学习，用毛泽东同志这个辉煌的思想把我们更好地武装起来，为发展中国革命、保卫世界和平和结束帝国主义的斗争，作出更大的贡献，争取更大的胜利。
