(Our newspaper, Jinan, 13th dispatch) The CCP Gaotang County Committee organized a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in all county work and achieved great results. In all walks of life, in all townships and communes in Gaotang County, high-speed forward development has emerged, with a new situation of leap forward in every field and in every area.

Since the beginning of this year, the 340,000 people of Gaotang County have been spirited and united as one, with one production upsurge following another. The county basically achieved water conservancy in April. Of the 1,020,000 mu of cultivated land, more than 800,000 mu can be irrigated; fertilizer application has increased from 4,500 jin per mu in previous years to 120,000 jin per mu this year; all land has been realized as large-scale ridge fields; the cotton seedlings on 400,000 mu of cotton fields were growing vigorously, with the tallest cotton plants reaching 7.5 chi, and the average cotton plants were also 2-3 chi tall. At present, according to the first picking of cotton and the result of checking the plants and counting the bolls, it is estimated that the county can pick an average of more than 367 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Grain crops are also growing very well. This economic crop area, which relied on the state for grain supply in the first half of this year, can not only be self-sufficient in grain after this autumn, but also have surplus grain. The average yield per mu of more than 526,460 mu of grain crops has reached more than 1,170 jin.

Here, villages and teams are running industries. Now, Gaotang County has started 40 industrial projects and established 137 joint factories.

Driven by the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the county's cultural education, recreational sports, health, finance and trade, and other aspects of work have also made leaps and bounds. In June of this year, the county basically eliminated illiteracy; in order to consolidate and improve, the county also held 520 "four-in-one" (learning culture, learning politics, learning scientific knowledge, learning agricultural technology) amateur Red and Expert high-level primary schools, 94 middle schools, and 41 Red and Expert universities; primary school education has been popularized throughout the county, with 95.4% of school-age children enrolled. Recreational sports have formed a broad mass movement. Every team has a club, amateur troupe, and sports association. There are more than 210,000 members of sports associations in the county, and 591 youth sports schools have been established.

In order to achieve a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in various tasks, the Gaotang County Committee skillfully used the methods of "politics taking command" and "ideology leading the way." Since the beginning of this year, it has conducted 11 on-site rectification campaigns according to the needs of the production movement and launched extensive airing of views, big debates on various erroneous ideas. The county has particularly focused on criticizing the mechanistic materialistic ideas of "conventionalism," "empiricism," "fatalism," and "conditionalism." Through continuous ideological revolution, the subjective initiative of the people has been fully brought into play. From practice, Gaotang County has found a good form of continuous ideological revolution, that is, constantly carrying out inspections and comparisons and constantly carrying out rectification during the intervals of the production movement. This form has great significance for promoting a comprehensive Great Leap Forward.

Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the Gaotang County Committee changed its past general appeals and all-encompassing approaches, and instead skillfully used the working method of "grasping the key link to bring along everything else." In each period of work, the County Committee has firmly grasped the main contradictions. With the "key link" in the work, it further adopted the working method of turning the completion of various tasks into movements and organizing major assaults. Practice has proved that this is an effective method to adapt to the characteristics of rural work, which has many tasks, tight schedules, and strong seasonality. According to the experience of the Gaotang County Committee, there are many benefits to launching assaults: First, the whole people are mobilized, cadres are dispatched, the strength of the people is great, and enthusiasm is high, which can create miracles; second, it can ensure that key tasks do not miss the season during busy farming; third, the launch of an assault can open up a new movement, break through key points, set examples, and drive the overall situation; fourth, the assault facilitates the exertion of collective wisdom, overcomes major difficulties, shows people's subjective initiative, and thus lays the foundation for the confidence that man will conquer nature. The slogan circulating in the rural areas of Gaotang: "Hands hold up the sky and turn it, feet kick the ground and turn it over, how bold people are, how much the land produces," is derived from this. Fifth, through the assault, cadres are tested, which facilitates the cultivation of a contingent of socialist construction activists who have firm positions, dare to be original, are in contact with the masses, and are both Red and expert.

Since the first half of this year, the Gaotang County Committee has prominently grasped 11 major movements, including drought resistance and spring irrigation, eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene, sowing densely, industrial upsurge, water conservancy construction, cultural and technological revolution, drought resistance and dual protection, general line propaganda, and fertilizer accumulation. Each movement is interspersed and combined, and mutually driven. In each movement, the general policy of taking rectification as the command, taking production as the center, and driving the comprehensive leap forward of various tasks has been specifically implemented. In specific control, on the one hand, emphasis is placed on production, highlighting the center, while on the other hand, plans are made for other tasks, specific arrangements are made, internal connections are found according to different seasons and different work natures, specific requirements are put forward, and the enthusiasm and initiative of various departments are fully brought into play, combining the business work of various departments with clear directions in each period. For example, in the fertilizer accumulation and application movement, the County Committee put forward the slogan of working hard and fiercely for 15 days to ensure that the amount of fertilizer applied per mu exceeds 100,000 jin. The whole party and the whole people responded enthusiastically, and every household cleaned up garbage and looked for fertilizer sources inside and outside the house. After 20 days of hard work, the county accumulated and transported more than 170 billion jin of fertilizer, with an average of more than 160,000 jin of top dressing per mu. It also promoted hygiene work. In finding fertilizer sources and emphasizing hygiene, the masses cleaned up many broken and waste steel, which also drove the purchasing work of the supply and marketing cooperative. The task of purchasing 600,000 jin of waste steel throughout the year was overfulfilled nine times as early as the end of August. In the drought resistance movement, all departments, under the unified deployment of the Party Committee, went all out to promote their business to serve the center. The propaganda department mobilized more than 50,000 propaganda troops, using various forms such as blackboards, loudspeakers, clappers, and storytelling to carry out extensive propaganda activities, commend the advanced, and praise models. The health department organized 323 doctors from the county to bring medicine to the countryside and go deep into the fields for mobile treatment.

After the realization of people's communes, Gaotang County also made corresponding improvements in its leadership methods. According to the new situation of the 11 departments of the people's commune, such as cotton, grain, water conservancy, culture, and welfare, the County Committee set up 11 offices, with secretaries taking charge of everything and committee members managing the departments. In the autumn plowing and planting work, we first grasped politics in command, launched a struggle between two roads through airing views and debates, and organized large-scale operations with the main contents of military organization, collective life, and fighting production. In the deep plowing and autumn planting movement not long ago, more than 220,000 laborers were invested every day, accounting for more than 140% of the county's labor force. Since the county itself has no iron ore, Cao Zidan, the first secretary of the County Committee, and Wei Fuguo, the secretary, personally led an expeditionary force of 2,700 people to the Zibo area to mine and smelt iron. After more than 10 months of practical training and education this year, the cadres and masses of Gaotang County have now achieved the following situation: as long as the Party Committee gives an order, it can immediately form a situation of "all fronts are mobilized and thousands of troops are dispatched."

    高唐县各项工作全面大跃进
    政治挂帅　思想开道
    本报济南13日电　中共高唐县委组织全县工作全面大跃进，获得很大成绩。在高唐县各行各业，各乡各社，都以高速度向前发展，出现了条条跃进，块块跃进的新形势。
    今年以来，高唐县的三十四万人民，精神奋发，拧成一股绳，生产高潮一个接着一个。全县在4月份就基本实现水利化，一百零二万亩耕地，能灌溉的达八十多万亩；肥料由往年亩施四千五百斤，提高到今年亩施十二万斤；全部土地已实现大地畦田化；四十万亩棉田棉苗在生长旺盛时，棉棵高者达七尺五寸，一般的棉花也有二、三尺高。目前，根据第一喷拾棉的情况和查棵算桃的结果，估算全县每亩平均能拾皮棉三百六十七斤多。粮食作物也生长得很好，这个在今年上半年还依靠国家调粮供应的经济作物区，今年秋后不仅可以粮食自给，还可以有余粮，五十二万六千四百六十多亩粮食作物，平均亩产达到一千一百七十多斤。
    在这里，村村队队都在办工业。现在，高唐县已搞起四十个工业项目，建立联合工厂一百三十七处。
    在工农业生产大跃进的带动下，这个县的文化教育、文娱体育、卫生、财贸等各方面的工作也都有飞跃的发展。今年6月全县已基本上实现无盲县；为了边巩固、边提高，全县还举办了四合一（学文化、学政治、学科学知识、学农业技术）业余红专高小五百二十处，中学九十四处，红专大学四十一处；小学教育已经普及全县，入学儿童达到95.4％。文娱体育已形成广大群众性的运动，队队有俱乐部、业余剧团、体育协会，全县有体育协会会员二十一万多人，建立了青少年体育学校五百九十一处。
    为了使各种工作全面大跃进，高唐县委熟练地运用了“政治挂帅”、“思想开道”的方法，今年以来根据生产运动的需要，曾经进行十一次实地整风，并对各种错误思想展开大鸣大放、大辩论。全县特别集中批判了“常规论”、“经验论”、“定局论”、“条件论”等机械唯物论的思想。经过不断的思想革命，这就充分地发挥了人们主观能动性的作用。从实践中高唐县已经找到了一种思想不断革命的好形式，这就是随着生产运动的间隙，不断进行检查评比，不断进行整风，这种形式对于推动全面大跃进有着重大的意义。
    高唐县委在大跃进的形势下，改变了过去一般化的号召和面面俱到的做法，而是熟练地运用了“纲举目张”的工作方法。县委在每一个时期的工作中，都紧紧地抓住了主要矛盾，有了工作中的“纲”，便进一步采取了完成各种任务运动化，组织大突击的工作方法。实践证明，这是适应农村工作头多、事紧、季节性强等特点的行之有效的方法。根据高唐县委的体会，搞突击的好处很多：第一、全民动手，干部出征，力大人多热情高，能创造奇迹；第二、可以保证关键性的任务，不致在农忙中错过季节；第三、一件新的运动到来，开展突击能打开局面，从中突破重点，作出榜样，带动全盘；第四、突击便于发挥集体智慧，战胜重大困难，显示人的主观能动性，从而奠定人定胜天的信心。高唐农村流传的：“手托天转，脚蹬地翻，人有多大胆，地有多大产”的口号，就是由此得出的。第五、通过突击考验干部，便于培养立场坚定、敢于独创、联系群众、又红又专的社会主义建设积极分子队伍。
    今年上半年以来，高唐县委突出的抓住了抗旱春灌、除四害讲卫生、播种密植、工业高潮、水利建设、文化技术革命、抗旱双保、总路线宣传、积肥等十一项大的运动，各个运动都是穿插结合，相互带动，在每个运动中都具体贯彻了以整风为统帅，以生产为中心带动各项工作全面跃进的方针。在具体掌握上，一方面强调生产、突出中心，同时对其它各项工作都进行规划，具体安排，根据不同季节，不同工作性质，找出他们的内在联系，提出具体要求，结合各部门的业务工作在各个时期都有明确的方向，从而充分发挥各部门的积极性、主动性。如在积肥施肥运动中，县委提出大干、猛干十五天，保证每亩施肥超十万斤的号召，全党全民奋起响应，家家户户清垃圾，屋里屋外找肥源，经过二十天奋战，全县积运肥料一千七百多亿斤，每亩平均可以追肥十六万斤以上。同时也带动搞好了卫生工作。在找肥源、讲卫生中，群众清理出许多破废钢铁，又带动了供销社的收购工作。全年收购废钢铁六十万斤的任务，早在8月底超额九倍完成。在抗旱运动中，各部门在党委统一部署下，全力以赴地推动自己的业务为中心服务。宣传部门动员了五万多宣传大军，利用黑板报、广播筒、快板、说唱等各种形式，广泛地开展了宣传活动，表扬先进，歌颂模范。卫生部门组织全县三百二十三个医生带药下乡，深入田间巡回治疗。
    实现人民公社化以后，高唐县在领导方法上也随着作了相应的改进，县委根据人民公社设立的棉花、粮食、水利、文化、福利等十一个部的新情况，设立了十一个办公室，行行事事有书记挂帅，委员分部管理。在秋耕秋种工作中首先抓住了政治挂帅，通过鸣放辩论开展了两条道路的斗争，并以组织军事化、生活集体化、生产战斗化等为主要内容，组织了大兵团作战。不久前的深翻秋种运动中，每天投入的劳力有二十二万多人，占全县劳动力的140％多。由于这个县本身没有铁矿，县委第一书记曹子丹、书记魏富国亲自率领了二千七百人的远征军赴淄博地区开矿炼铁。经过今年十个多月的实际锻炼和教育，高唐县的干部和群众现在已经作到这样的情况：只要党委一声号令，就可以立即形成“各个战线齐动员，千军万马齐出征”的局面。　	（林麟）
