    Xuchang Special District Vigorously Grasps Six Links in Transportation
    Main and Branch Lines Unblocked, Goods Unloaded Upon Arrival
    (Our report) Henan Province's Xuchang Special District, under the slogan of "Guaranteeing the Marshal's Ascent of Steel, Transportation Takes the Lead," has tightly grasped six links in transportation, forming a powerful combat whole of 500,000 transportation troops and hundreds of thousands of vehicles including automobiles, horse-drawn carts, ox carts, push carts, handcarts, and bicycles. The entire army was mobilized, fundamentally reversing the passive situation caused by large transport volume and small transport capacity.
    The six links they grasped are: 1. Relay Transportation, 2. Loading and Unloading, 3. Collaboration, 4. Road Repair, 5. Safety, 6. Technical Revolution.
    Grasping relay transportation mainly involves using tools such as ox carts and horse-drawn carts to collect and distribute goods for automobiles, connecting main lines with branch lines, and long-distance transportation with short-distance transportation. They proposed: Let ox carts and horse-drawn carts serve automobiles, automobiles serve trains, simple roads serve highways, and highways serve railways. From September 1st to October 20th, ox carts, horse-drawn carts, etc., in the entire district collected and distributed a total of 179,957 tons of goods for automobiles, guaranteeing the production of steel and the transportation of other urgently needed materials.
    Grasping loading and unloading: First, mobilize the entire people to solve the problem of cargo yard congestion through a concentrated effort, then establish a large loading and unloading army, loading and unloading goods as soon as vehicles arrive. Each county promoted the experience of Luhe City in mobilizing the entire people for loading and unloading. The city's 50,000-strong loading and unloading army was divided into three teams: the first team was a standing army composed of loading and unloading workers; the second team was a leaping team composed of street residents, participating in loading and unloading when transport volume suddenly increased; the third team was a shock force composed of schools, organizations, and groups, supporting loading and unloading when transport volume was especially large; important market towns also organized a loading and unloading army that was both workers and farmers and soldiers. Due to the promotion of various advanced experiences by the loading and unloading army, most counties achieved an average loading and unloading time of no more than one minute per ton of goods.
    Grasping collaboration: Primarily grasping dispatching and organizing sources of goods. With 80% of the transportation tools supporting steel production, the transportation departments achieved unified arrangements, comprehensive consideration, and tried their best to meet the needs of various departments. Material departments were required to ensure timely submission of consignment plans; when transport capacity and transport volume changed, both carriers and consignors were required to notify in advance so that timely rearrangements could be made. In order to do a good job of collaboration, the Xuchang Special District Transportation Headquarters also proposed that the following should be achieved: advanced tools and backward tools should be well connected, simple roads and highways should be well connected, material departments and transportation departments should be well connected, related materials should be well connected, transportation departments and loading and unloading departments should be well connected, and economic departments and administrative departments should be well connected.
    Grasping highways: In the great steelmaking movement, many counties fought hard for several days and nights, and built new highways. Yu County organized a strong and powerful road repair army of 100,000 people, divided into eleven command posts, fighting hard for three days and nights, realizing the stone surface of all major highway trunk lines in the county. Each district and township also established road maintenance brigades, with an average of one road maintenance worker per kilometer. They mostly camped by the roadside, living and eating collectively. Road maintenance implemented frequent watering, frequent sanding, frequent leveling, and frequent inspection; achieving a flat road surface, smooth passage in sunny and rainy weather, repair as soon as damage occurred, and ensuring safety. Since September, the entire special district has repaired a total of eighty-three highways, with a total length of more than 1,170 kilometers, basically forming a highway network centered on Xuchang City.
    Grasping safety: In order to achieve safe driving and orderly traffic, Lushan, Xiangcheng and other counties organized militia to serve as traffic police. Xiangcheng County also widely carried out traffic safety education among the masses, formulated traffic safety rules, and strictly supervised their implementation.
    Grasping technical revolution: Since August, the entire special district has launched a mass-based technical revolution centered on the bearingization of backward transportation tools and the train-ization of automobiles, which has achieved great results.
    Currently, the entire special district has established transportation headquarters at all levels from top to bottom, with the Party Committee Secretary personally taking charge. 95% of the transportation tools have been organized. Their battle slogans are: "The entire Party and the entire people engage in transportation, all transportation tools are mobilized, vehicles are everywhere on plains and hills, main and branch lines are all connected." While completing the annual freight plan, they will form three transportation networks in the entire district - a highway network, a road maintenance network, and a safety network - and achieve fiveizations - stone or brick paving of road surfaces, vehiclization of transportation in mountainous areas, ball bearingization and rubberization of vehicles, train hauling by automobiles, and shipping on small river canals.

### 许昌专区猛抓交通运输六环节  干道支线畅通　货物随到随卸

    许昌专区猛抓交通运输六环节
    干道支线畅通　货物随到随卸
    本报讯　河南省许昌专区在“保证钢铁元帅升帐，运输当好先行”的口号下，紧紧抓住运输上的六个环节，使五十万运输大军和几十万辆汽车、马车、牛车、架子车、手推车、自行车组成了一个强大的战斗整体。全军出动，基本扭转了由于运量大运力小所造成的被动局面。
    他们抓的六个环节是：一、接力运输，二、装卸，三、协作，四、修路，五、安全，六、技术革命。
    抓接力运输，主要是利用牛车、马车等工具为汽车集散货物，使干线和支线、长距离运输和短距离运输衔接起来。他们提出：让牛车、马车为汽车服务，汽车为火车服务，便道为公路服务，公路为铁路服务。从9月1日到10月20日，全区牛车、马车等共为汽车集散货物十七万九千九百五十七吨，保证了钢铁生产和其他急需物资的运输。
    抓装卸：首先全民动员突击解决货场堵塞问题，然后建立装卸搬运大军，车子开到随装随卸。各县推行了漯河市全民搞装卸的经验。这个市五万装卸大军分别编成三个队：第一队是装卸搬运工人组成的常备军；第二队是街道居民组成的跃进队，在运量突然增加时参加装卸；第三队是由学校、机关团体组成的突击队，在运量特大时支援装卸；重要集镇还组织了亦工亦农亦兵的装卸大军。由于装卸大军推广了各种先进经验，大部分县都做到了装卸一吨货平均不超过一分钟。
    抓协作：主要是抓调度和组织货源。在80％的交通运输工具支援钢铁生产的情况下，运输部门做到统一安排，全面照顾，尽量满足各部门的需要。对物资部门要求能保证按时报送托运计划；在运力和运量变化时，承运和托运双方都要提前通知，以便及时重新安排。许昌专区交通指挥部为了搞好协作，还提出要做到：先进工具和落后工具衔接好，便路和公路衔接好，物资部门和运输部门衔接好，有关的物资之间衔接好，运输部门和装卸搬运部门衔接好，经济部门和行政部门衔接好。
    抓公路：在大办钢铁运动中，很多县苦战几昼夜，就修起了一条条新的公路。禹县组织了十万兵强马壮的修路大军，编成十一个指挥部，苦战三昼夜，实现了全县各主要公路干线路面石子化。各区、乡还建立了养路大队，平均一公里有一个养路员。他们大都在路旁扎营，集体食宿。养路中实行勤洒水，勤铺沙，勤平路，勤检查；做到路面平整，晴雨畅通，随坏随修，保证安全。全专区从9月份以来，共整修公路八十三条，全长一千一百七十多公里，基本上形成了以许昌市为中心的公路网。
    抓安全：为了做到行车安全，秩序井然，鲁山、襄城等县都组织民兵担任交通民警。襄城县还广泛地向群众进行了交通安全教育，制定了交通安全规则严格督促执行。
    抓技术革命：全专区从8月份以来，开展了群众性的以落后运输工具滚珠轴承化、汽车列车化为中心的技术革命，收到很大效果。
    目前，全专区已自上而下建立了各级交通运输指挥部，由党委书记亲自挂帅。95％的运输工具都已组织起来。他们的战斗口号是：“全党全民办交通，运输工具齐出动，平原山岗车子化，干道支线都沟通”。他们要在完成全年货运计划的同时，在全区组成交通运输的三网——公路网、养路网、安全网，实现五化——路面石子砖碴化，山区运输车辆化，车辆滚珠胶皮化，汽车拖带列车化，小河干渠船运化。
