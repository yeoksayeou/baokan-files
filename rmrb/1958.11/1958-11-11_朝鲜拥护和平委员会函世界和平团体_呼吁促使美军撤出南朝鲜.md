Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th. The Korean Central News Agency reported that the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace sent a letter on the 8th to the World Peace Council, the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, and peace organizations and peace fighters of various countries, calling on them to support the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and the demand for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.

The committee also attached the statement issued by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on October 28 regarding the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea.

The letter stated that the Korean people are waging a tenacious struggle to make the US military follow the example of the Chinese People's Volunteers and immediately withdraw from South Korea.

The letter pointed out that the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea has opened up a new situation for the resolution of the Korean issue. The letter condemned US imperialism for not only refusing to withdraw its troops from South Korea but also turning South Korea into a new atomic war base, continuing to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, and threatening peace in the Far East and the world.

The letter expressed its belief that peace organizations and peace fighters of all countries will warmly support and support the Korean people's just struggle to demand the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and the peaceful reunification of their motherland by the Korean people themselves, so as to make a significant contribution to safeguarding and consolidating peace in the Far East and the world.
