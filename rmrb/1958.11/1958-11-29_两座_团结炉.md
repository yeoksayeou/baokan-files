Two "Unity Furnaces"

By our reporter, Xian Ruiguang

In the Hui Autonomous Region of Ningxia, in a narrow valley called "Turning Back Hollow" in the northwest corner of the Helan Mountain Iron and Steel Works, a story circulates about two "Unity Furnaces." Since they were built in late October, these furnaces have been continuously producing iron, and people excitedly call them a "new crystallization of the communist unity and friendship of the Hui and Han peoples."

The furnace chiefs who established and operate these two "Unity Furnaces" are two male and female commune members from the Avant-garde People's Commune, organized by the Hui and Han people of Helan County: the male is a young Han man named Yang Yuqi; the female is a Hui girl named Wu Yuefang. These two people, who grew up in the countryside for a long time, were originally unfamiliar with iron smelting. In mid-October, the Hui and Han commune members of the Avant-garde People's Commune unanimously requested to go to the Helan Mountains, more than 200 li away from their homes, to smelt iron. Yang Yuqi and Wu Yuefang, like other commune members, went up the mountain. After more than a month of unity and mutual assistance, and mutual teaching of technology, the two of them are now among the most outstanding furnace chiefs in the army of more than 50,000 Hui and Han iron smelters in Helan Mountain.

Although Yang Yuqi and Wu Yuefang, these two Hui and Han youths, were in the same brigade of the People's Commune, they did not know each other because they lived in two villages more than a dozen li apart. This time, when they smelted iron, they became as close as siblings as soon as they met. On the evening of the day they went up the mountain, Wu Yuefang said to Yang Yuqi: "The Party has entrusted us with such a glorious task, we must study hard and be sure to smelt iron." Yang Yuqi smiled and said: "As long as the Hui and Han commune members are closely united, iron will definitely be smelted." The next day, the Hui and Han commune members went happily to mine ore and coal, while Wu Yuefang and Yang Yuqi tried to build a furnace. But neither of them knew how to build one, and the glorious task of iron smelting was constantly urging them. The two thought hard for a while at the construction site. Wu Yuefang suddenly said: "No matter what, we must try every possible means to smelt iron. Isn't there a *kang* (a type of heated brick bed) made of mud in our homes? We can imitate that form and process it a bit to make an 'earthen square furnace' and see if we can smelt iron." Yang Yuqi was moved by this girl's intelligence and strong will to smelt iron, and resolutely said: "Let's do as you said, no matter how difficult it is, I can overcome it, and the task of smelting iron must be completed!" So, Wu Yuefang carried stones, and Yang Yuqi plastered the furnace, and soon they built an "earthen square furnace". When the commune members who were mining and coal saw it, they sang happily: "The Hui and Han people are united tightly, steel piles up like a mountain peak!" Who knew that after burning for a day and a night, very little iron was smelted. Everyone was very anxious. They asked Party Branch Secretary Feng Jufu for instructions. Feng Jufu told them that iron smelting was not very easy, and that they should study carefully and learn from other places. Wu Yuefang proposed to go to other places to study, but Yang Yuqi said: "You are a girl, just going out, not much experience, let me go." The two argued for a long time, but in the end Yang Yuqi went.

After Yang Yuqi returned, he told Wu Yuefang everything he had learned about the furnace type, furnace building, batching, charging, and smelting techniques from Ningxia County. In order to enable the Hui and Han commune members to quickly master the local method of iron smelting, the Party Branch designated Yang Yuqi and Wu Yuefang as furnace chiefs, and assigned them to lead a group of male and female commune members to be responsible for furnace building and smelting. On the evening that Yang Yuqi and Wu Yuefang decided to build the furnace, a piercing northwest wind happened to blow on Helan Mountain, followed by heavy snow. At this time, Yang Yuqi, who was building the furnace, thought of Wu Yuefang: I just taught her the technology, can she use it? Can an eighteen-year-old Hui girl withstand the attack of wind and snow? He dropped the furnace he was building and ran to Wu Yuefang's construction site. He saw dozens of Hui and Han female commune members in the wind and snow, all full of energy: some were moving stones, some were carrying coal, and some were transporting ore. Wu Yuefang led a few people to build the furnace wall in the excavated pit. But the frozen clay could not stick to the sandy soil furnace wall. He told her, "Thin mud can smooth the wall." Spray some water on the sandy soil furnace wall, and it will be easier to stick if the mud is thinner. While braving the wind and snow, he carried a load of water to help her build the furnace wall, until Wu Yuefang and many women had mastered the technology of building and loading the furnace, and loaded the furnace, before returning to his own furnace to prepare to work overtime overnight to build the furnace.

Who knew that just as he was about to process and build his own furnace, Wu Yuefang braved the wind and snow with several women to help him build the furnace. After a night of battle, two "earth furnaces" symbolizing the new communist ethnic relations appeared in this valley.

After the furnace was lit, Yang Yuqi was still worried, afraid that an accident would affect production and make Wu Yuefang even more anxious. Whenever he guarded the furnace at night, he would teach Wu Yuefang and the Hui commune members to learn smelting technology, which made Wu Yuefang even more grateful. One night after twelve o'clock, Wu Yuefang went to Yang Yuqi as usual to discuss iron smelting technology, but when she walked into his work shed, she found that Yang Yuqi was sleeping soundly. She covered him with the quilt and was about to go out when she suddenly found that Yang Yuqi's cotton trousers were torn, revealing the cotton. She quietly put them in her arms and went back to her companions and said: "Sisters, look, the male comrades are helping us smelt iron, and no one mends their torn clothes; let's help them mend them as a little concern for them!" So, the women went to the male commune members to ask for clothes to mend. Wu Yuefang carefully sewed Yang Yuqi's cotton trousers by the blazing furnace, making them brand new. The next day, when Yang Yuqi got up, he suddenly found that his cotton trousers were new. From Wu Yuefang's consistent concern for his life, he knew that she had mended them. This feeling of class friendship moved him to tears. That day, he and Branch Secretary Feng Jufu discussed and visited nearby areas to learn the experience of mastering the heat and the changes in the color of fire in advanced furnaces, and told Wu Yuefang and the others in the evening: what is the color of fire when ore burns, what is the color of fire when it melts, and what is the color of fire when iron comes out. And said: "To make the iron come out well, you must master the heat, otherwise, it is easy to form raw or oxidized phenomena." In this way, they mastered a relatively complete set of smelting technology.

The two furnaces were about to produce iron, and the Hui and Han commune members looked at the crystallization of their unity and friendship, and they all jumped up with joy. In order to celebrate the victory of national unity, the Hui and Han commune members called these two furnaces "Unity Furnaces."

The new model of national unity further strengthened the confidence of all the Hui and Han commune members in the team to smelt iron. So, the whole team launched activities to mutually transmit technology, learn from each other, and build "Unity Furnaces" on a large scale. In a few days, the team built one hundred "Unity Furnaces" and smelted more than thirty tons of pig iron in more than twenty days.

    两座“团结炉”
    本报记者　咸瑞光
    在宁夏回族自治区贺兰山钢铁工地西北角的一条带形峡谷——回头窝里，流传着两座“团结炉”的故事，这两座团结炉从10月下旬建炉以来，到现在一直连续出铁，人们都兴奋得把它叫“回汉人民共产主义团结友爱的新结晶”。
    建立和操作这两座“团结炉”的炉长，是贺兰县回、汉人民组织起来的前锋人民公社的两个男、女社员：男的是个汉族青年，叫杨玉琪；女的是个回族姑娘，叫吴月芳。这两个长期生长在农村的人，原来对炼铁是陌生的，10月中旬，前锋人民公社的回、汉族社员，一致要求到离家二百多里路的贺兰山去炼铁。杨玉琪和吴月芳两人，也同其他社员一样上山了。经过一个多月团结互助，互相传授技术，现在他们两人已是贺兰山五万多名回、汉炼铁大军中最出色的炉长之一。
    杨玉琪和吴月芳这两个回、汉青年虽然同在人民公社的一个大队里，但由于他们分别居住在相距十几华里的两个村庄里，两人并不相识。这次炼铁时，两人一见就像亲兄妹一样亲密。上山的当天晚上，吴月芳就对杨玉琪说：“党把这样光荣的任务交给咱们，可得努力钻研，一定要炼出铁来，”杨玉琪笑着说：“只要回、汉社员亲密团结，铁一定会炼出来。”第二天，回、汉社员们都兴高彩烈地采矿、采煤去了，吴月芳和杨玉琪两人就试着建炉。可是两个人都不会建，而炼铁的光荣任务又随时催促着他们，两人在工地上想了好一回，吴月芳突然说：“不管想尽千方百计，总要把铁炼出来。咱们家里不是泥过扯炕（当地群众睡觉的一种热炕）吗，咱们可以仿照那种形式，再把它加工一下，变成个‘土方炉’，看能不能炼出铁来。”杨玉琪被这个女孩子的聪明和炼铁的坚强意志所感动，也坚决地说：“就照你说的办吧，不管有多大困难，我都能克服它，炼铁任务一定要完成！”于是，吴月芳背石头，杨玉琪泥炉子，很快就建起了一座“土方炉”。采矿、采煤的社员看到后，都高兴地唱起来：“回汉人民团结紧，钢铁堆得像山峰！”谁知烧了一天一夜，炼出来的铁却很少。大家非常焦急。他们请示了党支部书记冯聚富，冯聚富告诉他们，炼铁并不是十分容易的，应当仔细钻研，向别的地方学习。吴月芳提出要去外地学习，杨玉琪说：“你是个女孩子，刚刚出门，经验不多，还是让我去吧。”两人争论了好久，最后还是杨玉琪走了。
    杨玉琪回来以后，把学习宁朔县的炉型、建炉、配料、装炉、冶炼等技术，全部告诉给吴月芳。党支部为了让回汉族社员很快掌握土法炼铁技术，就指定杨玉琪和吴月芳担任炉长，让他们分别带领一批男女社员负责建炉和冶炼。杨玉琪和吴月芳决定建炉的这天晚上，碰巧贺兰山上刮起了刺骨的西北风，接着飞起了鹅毛大雪。这时正在建炉的杨玉琪想起了吴月芳：我刚刚把技术教给她，她能利用吗？一个才十八岁的回族女孩子，能受得住风雪的袭击吗？他丢下自己正在建立的炉，连忙跑到吴月芳的工地。一看，几十个回、汉族女社员在风雪中，个个干劲十足：有的搬石块，有的背煤，有的运矿石。吴月芳领着几个人在挖好的土坑内砌炉壁。但是冻僵了的坩泥怎么也沾不到沙土炉壁上，他一边告诉她，“稀泥才能抹光墙”，在沙土炉壁上喷些水，再把泥和稀些就容易沾住了；一边冒着风雪担了一担水，帮她砌炉壁，直等吴月芳和许多妇女全部掌握了建炉装炉技术，把炉装好后，才回到自己的炉旁准备连夜加班建炉。
    谁知他正要加工建自己的炉时，吴月芳又冒着风雪带着几名妇女来帮他建炉了。这样经过一夜的战斗，两座象征着共产主义民族新关系的“大地炉”便出现在这个山谷里。
    炉子点燃以后，杨玉琪仍然不放心，单怕出了事故会影响生产，使吴月芳更加焦急。每当夜晚守炉的时候，他就教吴月芳和回族社员学冶炼技术。使吴月芳更加感激。有一天夜晚十二点以后，吴月芳照例去找杨玉琪交谈炼铁技术，但当她走进他的工棚后，发现杨玉琪正睡得香甜，她把被子给盖好后正要出门时，忽然发现杨玉琪的棉裤烂的露出了棉花，她悄悄地揣到怀里，回去给她的同伴说：“姊妹们，你们看，男同志帮助咱们炼铁，衣服扯烂了也没人给缝补；咱们帮他们缝补一下，也算是对他们的一点关心啊！”于是，妇女们都纷纷去找男社员要衣服缝补。吴月芳在熊熊的火炉旁边一针一线的给杨玉琪把棉裤缝补得一新。第二天，杨玉琪起床后，突然发现自己的棉裤新了，从吴月芳一贯关心他的生活上，他就知道是她补的。这种阶级友爱的情感使他感动得几乎流下泪来。当天，他和支部书记冯聚富同志研究，并参观了附近地区先进炉的掌握火候的经验和火色的变化，在晚上告诉给吴月芳她们：矿石燃烧是什么火色，熔化是什么火色，出铁是什么火色。并说：“要使铁出得好，一定要掌握火候，不然，容易形成夹生或氧化等现象。”这样，使得她们掌握了一套比较完整的冶炼技术。
    两座炉子要出铁了，回、汉社员们看着他们团结友爱的结晶，一个个都高兴得跳起来。回、汉社员为了祝贺民族团结的胜利，把这两座炉叫“团结炉”。
    新的民族团结的榜样，更加坚定了全队回、汉社员炼铁的信心。于是，全队整个工地展开了互传技术、互学技术，大建“团结炉”的活动。不几天，全队建起了一百个“团结炉”，二十多天就炼出生铁三十多吨。
