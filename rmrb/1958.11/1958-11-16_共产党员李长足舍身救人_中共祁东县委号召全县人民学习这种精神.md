Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 15th. Li Changzu, deputy director of Gaoyuqi Coal Mine in Qidong County, Hunan Province, and a Communist Party member, used his shoulders to hold up the pillars of the factory shed when the Shuikouzi coal mine shed in the mine collapsed, saving seventeen workers. He gloriously sacrificed himself when he was crushed under the factory shed frame weighing more than 10,000 catties. The Qidong County Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the people of the county to learn from Comrade Li Changzu's great communist spirit of selflessness.

Shuikouzi Coal Mine is the most productive coal mine in Gaoyuqi Coal Mine. A factory shed was built at the entrance of the mine to shelter it from wind and rain. This factory shed was not strong. On the morning of October 23, a force seven gale blew, shaking the factory shed frame, and the factory shed began to tilt, posing a danger of collapse. Li Changzu, who was assigned to be responsible here, discussed with Party Branch Secretary Chen Ze'an and decided to renovate it. After breakfast on the 23rd, he personally led the workers to start the renovation. By 2 p.m., all the straw on the factory shed had been removed, but the factory shed frame was more inclined than before because people were walking and trampling on it when they were removing the straw. The connection between the crossbeam and the main pillar began to loosen. At this time, they reduced the number of people on the factory shed, leaving only three people on the factory shed frame to tie the willow branches tightly to the factory shed frame with straw ropes, and the rest of the people came to the ground to tie thatch braids. Li Changzu and several workers began to straighten the pillars. However, because the factory shed frame and willow branches were all wet pine trees, they were too heavy, and the effort was ineffective. Li Changzu came out to look at the factory shed and consider new methods. Suddenly, the entire factory shed frame tilted into a slope of eighty degrees and continued to slope downward. Communist Party member Liu Jinghua hurriedly used his shoulder to hold up the main pillar of the factory shed, but still could not stop the factory shed from sloping downward. Seeing that the factory shed frame was about to collapse, at this critical moment, Li Changzu, in order to save the seventeen workers under the factory shed, quickly ran from outside the shed to the inside, shouting for everyone to get out of the way. He ran to Liu Jinghua's side, pushed him out of the factory shed, and used all his strength to hold up the main pillar of the factory shed with his shoulder, so that the factory shed would collapse more slowly, so that the workers could escape danger. The workers heard the sound and quickly dodged. Liu Jinghua also ran half of his body out of the factory shed. The factory shed collapsed with a "crash," and a crossbeam hit Li Changzu's chest. The factory shed frame weighing more than 10,000 catties crushed Li Changzu. He gloriously sacrificed himself for the cause of the Party and for saving others. Seventeen workers were rescued as a result, and only Liu Jinghua and five others suffered minor injuries.

After learning the news of Comrade Li Changzu's glorious sacrifice, the Qidong County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County People's Committee sent a delegation to offer condolences, held a memorial meeting, introduced his life story, and presented wreaths. The delegation also expressed condolences and provided compensation to Comrade Li Changzu's family. The Qidong County Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the people of the county to learn from Comrade Li Changzu's communist spirit of selflessness. The seventeen workers who were rescued swore to inherit Comrade Li Changzu's cause and play an exemplary role in work, production, and study.

Comrade Li Changzu was thirty-five years old this year and came from a poor peasant family. He had begged for food when he was a child. At the age of sixteen, he was forced to join the army by the Kuomintang reactionaries and fled to Qiyang Guanyintan Coal Mine to work as a coolie. After liberation, he actively participated in various struggles and joined the Communist Party of China in 1952. In his work, he was always selfless and devoted himself to the Party. When he was the director of the rural agricultural cooperative, the organization transferred him to serve as the head of the mutual aid group due to work needs. He did not bargain at all and cheerfully obeyed the assignment. After he came to the mine from the agricultural cooperative (where he served as the director of supervision) in August this year, he worked actively. In addition to being responsible for all technical guidance, he also went down the mine with the workers to dig coal every day. He often stayed up for three or five nights without sleeping. Wherever it was most difficult, he fought there. He dedicated everything he had to the great cause of the Party and the people. He will always live in the hearts of the people.

    共产党员李长足舍身救人
    中共祁东县委号召全县人民学习这种精神
    新华社长沙15日电　湖南省祁东县高鱼歧煤矿副矿长、共产党员李长足，在这个矿的水口子煤窿厂棚倒塌时，用肩扛住厂棚柱子，救活十七个工人，而自己被压在一万多斤重的厂棚架下光荣牺牲。中共祁东县委号召全县人民学习李长足同志这种舍己为人的伟大的共产主义精神。
    水口子煤窿是高鱼歧煤矿产煤最多的煤窿，窿门口搭了一座遮避风雨的厂棚。这个厂棚不牢固。10月23日清晨，吹来了七级大风，把厂棚架吹动了，厂棚开始倾斜，有倒塌危险。分工在这里负责的李长足，同党支书陈泽安商量后，决定进行整修。23日早饭后，他亲自带领工人动手整修。到下午二时，厂棚上的稻草全部掀下来了，但是厂棚架子因人在上边掀草时走动和踩踏，比原来斜得更厉害了，横梁和正柱的衔接处开始松离。这时，他们就减少在厂棚上的人，只留下三个人在厂棚架上用草绳把柳条捆紧到厂棚架上，其余的人都来地上扎茅编。李长足便和几个工人动手扶正柱子。但因厂棚架和柳条全是湿松树，太重，用力不见效。李长足便出来看看厂棚，考虑新的办法。忽然间，整个厂棚架倾斜成八十度的坡形，并且继续下斜。共产党员刘景华忙用肩去扛住厂棚正柱，还是阻止不了厂棚下斜，眼看厂棚架就要倒下。在这千钧一发的时候，李长足为了要救出厂棚下的十七个工人，连忙从厂棚外跑向棚内，一面高喊大家快躲开；一面跑到刘景华身边，把他推出厂棚外，自己用尽平生之力以肩扛住厂棚正柱，让厂棚慢点倒，好使工人脱险。工人闻声后连忙躲开，刘景华也跑出半个身子在厂棚外，厂棚便“哗”的一声塌下来，一根横梁打中李长足的胸部，一万多斤重的厂棚架压到李长足的身上，他为党的事业、为拯救别人而光荣牺牲了。有十七个工人因此脱险，只有刘景华等五人受了点轻伤。
    中共祁东县委和县人民委员会在获悉李长足同志光荣牺牲的消息后，派出代表团前往吊唁，召开了追悼大会，介绍了他的生平事迹，并且献了花圈。代表团还对李长足同志的家属进行了慰问和抚恤。中共祁东县委号召全县人民学习李长足同志这种舍己为人的共产主义精神。被救活的十七个工人，宣誓要继承李长足同志的事业，在工作、生产、学习中起模范作用。
    李长足同志今年三十五岁，出身于贫农家庭。小的时候曾经讨过饭，十六岁时被国民党反动派征兵所迫，逃到祁阳观音滩煤矿做苦工。解放后，他积极参加各种斗争，在1952年加入了中国共产党。在工作中，他处处舍己为人，一心为党。在他任乡农协主任时，因工作需要，组织上调他担任互助组长，他一点不讲价钱，愉快地服从分配。今年8月他从农业社（原在社里担任监察主任）来到矿山后，积极工作，除负责全部技术指导外，并每天都和工人一起下窿挖煤。他经常三五夜不睡觉，那里最困难，他就战斗在那里。他把自己一切都献给了党和人民的伟大事业，他将永远活在人民的心里。
