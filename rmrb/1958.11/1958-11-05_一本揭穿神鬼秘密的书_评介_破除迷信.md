A Book Exposing the Secrets of Gods and Ghosts
—A Review of "Breaking Superstition"
		Ke An
    In the meeting celebrating the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Party at Peking University, Comrade Chen Boda pointed out that the activities of philosophers and the purpose of studying philosophy must be beneficial to the people and helpful to the cause of the people. He also said: "If some of our philosophers can discover the secrets of such gods, or compile many stories and materials of this kind written in past notes and novels, and carry out some specific publicity work, it would be a contribution of educational significance to the peasants." The comrades of the Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of the Philosophy Department of Peking University, based on this suggestion, spent twenty days, relying on collective strength, to compile a booklet entitled "Breaking Superstition." This book has been published by Zhonghua Book Company.
    The content of this book includes two parts. The first part uses relatively short sections to briefly introduce some famous ancient Chinese atheistic thoughts. Such as: the criticism and ridicule of Yan Ying in "Yanzi Chunqiu" of Duke Jing of Qi's absurd behavior of sacrificing to the mountain god and river god for rain; Xun Zi's materialistic explanation of heaven and the thought of man conquering nature; Wang Chong's refutation of the fallacy of the interaction between heaven and man and the exposure of the falseness of ghosts and gods; Fan Zhen's opposition to Buddhist superstition and opposition to the thought of cause and effect. The second part is forty-nine anti-superstition short stories compiled based on relevant materials from ancient Chinese history books and notes and novels, such as the River God marrying a wife and Shi Chong eliminating locusts, etc.
    This booklet has a more significant feature, that is, it uses materials from ancient Chinese books, and through relatively popular and lively texts, it exposes the secrets of ghosts and gods, and promotes materialistic thought. And because of its simplicity, clarity, vividness and interest, it is especially easily accepted and loved by the workers and peasants.
    Writing such a book against religious superstition is a very meaningful work. The writing and publication of this booklet can at least illustrate two issues: The first is that if people engaged in philosophy and the history of philosophy truly have the consciousness and determination to serve the people, they will definitely be able to make philosophy no longer be empty talk in the study, but put the task of philosophy on publicizing materialism and eliminating the idealistic influence in the minds of the masses. It is of great significance for clearing the enemies in the people's minds, liberating the people from the shackles of theocratic ideas, and raising the political and ideological awareness of the people. If it was said that it was still somewhat difficult in the past to completely break the people's, especially the peasants', superstition in gods, and the conditions were not yet mature, then the situation has completely changed now. Now is the era of the Great Leap Forward of the whole people, the era when the communist consciousness of the people is rapidly increasing. The Bodhisattvas erected by the peasants themselves are being pushed down and crushed by the peasants' own hands. The authority of the gods will completely give way to the authority of the people; the power of man replaces the power of "Heaven." The time and conditions for greatly breaking superstitions, greatly breaking ghosts and gods, and thoroughly eliminating the superstition of ghosts and gods from people's minds are already mature. At this time, theorists and historians of thought are needed to provide weapons and enlightenment.
    Secondly, the writing and publication of this booklet specifically shows people that there are indeed many materialistic intellectual essences in the rich historical and cultural classics of our motherland. As long as our ancient books are reorganized and published, we can truly put politics in command and implement the principle of emphasizing the present over the past, then we can make the past serve the present. To some extent, the publication of this booklet has also opened up a new path for us to sort out and publish ancient books, and pointed out a new direction. Although the sorting out and publication of ancient books is not limited to this aspect and this path, it is worth promoting as a direction.
    Of course, the booklet "Breaking Superstition" is not perfect either, and it has some obvious flaws. One of the important manifestations of this defect is that it does not pay enough attention to the broadest target audience—the peasants; when introducing and narrating the ancient Chinese atheistic thoughts, and when writing anti-superstition historical stories, it has not completely gotten rid of the so-called "history of philosophy" shackles, or to put it more frankly, it still reveals a lot of bookishness. For example, as for the origin of gods and the exploitation of gods and ghosts by the exploiting classes as a tool to consolidate their reactionary rule, these principles are only quoted in the foreword from a few sentences in an article in the sixth issue of the "Red Flag" magazine, without explaining them in depth and simple terms. In the writing of the stories, most of them are just telling the stories, without organically connecting these historical anti-superstition stories with the current actual life. In fact, in this regard, many problems can and should be connected for publicity and explanation. For example: the issue of moving graves that occurred because agricultural cooperatives merged into large cooperatives and established people's communes and needed to level the land; the use of old temples and ancestral halls in rural areas as school buildings and offices; the sabotage activities and disturbance of social order by reactionary Taoist sects, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements who use superstition in rural areas; the victory in water conservancy construction and drought resistance struggles compared to the past worshiping gods for rain; the extermination of insect pests compared to the so-called "divine insects" of the past; the elimination of serious endemic diseases (such as schistosomiasis, malaria, etc.) compared to the so-called "natural disasters" and "plague gods" of the past; the various names and origins of gods and monsters that used to be popular among the people (such as the God of Fire, the God of Plague, the God of Mountains, the God of Land, the God of Thunder, the Granny Wind, Bodhisattva, the God of Wealth, the God of the Hearth, the God of the Door, etc.) and other issues, can be revealed in a popular way in the book, removing their false roots, so that they have no foothold in people's minds. In terms of written language, although this book pays more attention to being popular, in specific expressions, the language often seems monotonous and rigid, and rarely pays attention to the use of the vivid language of the masses. This cannot but weaken the actual effect of this book to a certain extent. In addition, this book only talks about the theories of atheism in history from Yanzi and Xunzi in the pre-Qin period to Fan Zhen in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, and does not mention the representatives of atheistic thought in the long historical period from the Tang Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty, which is also a deficiency.
    Although this booklet still has these shortcomings, as mentioned earlier, it is needed at present, and its direction is also correct. We earnestly hope that philosophers, especially comrades engaged in the history of Chinese philosophy, will continue to make greater and better contributions to the people along the direction pointed out by the Party.

    一本揭穿神鬼秘密的书
    ——评介“破除迷信”
    柯安
    陈伯达同志在北京大学庆祝党成立三十七周年的大会上指出，哲学家的活动和学习哲学的目的，必须是对人民有益处，对人民的事业有帮助；并说：“如果我们有些哲学家能够发现这类神的秘密，或者把过去的笔记和小说所写的许多属于这类的故事和材料编一编，进行一些具体的宣传工作，也就是做了一件对农民有教育意义的贡献。”北京大学哲学系中国哲学史教研室的同志们，根据这个提示，用了二十天的时间，依靠集体的力量，编写了一本小册子，书名叫做“破除迷信”。这本书已经由中华书局出版了。
    这本书的内容包括两个部分。第一部分以比较短的篇幅，扼要地介绍了中国古代的一些著名的无神论思想。如：“晏子春秋”中晏婴对齐景公祭祀山神河伯祈雨的荒诞行为的批评和嘲笑；荀子对于天的唯物主义解释和人定胜天的思想；王充对于天人感应谬说的批驳和揭穿鬼神的虚妄；范缜反对佛教迷信、反对因果报应的思想。第二部分是根据中国古代史书和笔记、小说中的有关材料编写成的四十九个反迷信的小故事，例如河伯娶妇，石崇灭蝗等等。
    这本小册子，有一个比较显著的特点，就是它利用中国古书中的材料，通过比较通俗活泼的文字，揭穿了鬼神的秘密，宣传了唯物主义思想；并且由于它的通俗浅显，生动有趣，特别容易为工农群众所接受和喜爱。
    编写这样一本反对宗教迷信的书籍，是一件很有意义的工作。这本小册子的编写和出版，至少可以说明这样两个问题：首先是搞哲学和搞哲学史的人，如果真正有了为人民服务的自觉和决心，他就一定能够使哲学不再是书斋里的空谈，而把哲学的任务放在宣传唯物论，扫除人民群众思想中的唯心论影响上，对于清除人民脑子里的敌人，把人民群众从神权思想的绳索中解放出来，提高人民群众政治思想觉悟具有很重要的意义。如果说过去彻底破除人民群众，特别是农民群众对于神的迷信，还有若干困难，条件还不够成熟，那么现在的情形却完全变了。现在是全民大跃进的时代，是人民群众的共产主义觉悟急剧提高的时代，农民自己立起来的菩萨，正在由农民用自己的双手去推倒踏碎，神的权威将完全让位给人的权威；人的力量代替了“天”的力量。大破迷信，大破鬼神，从人们头脑中彻底清除对于鬼神的迷信的时机和条件，已经成熟了。在这个时候，就需要理论工作者，思想史工作者，给以武器，给以启发。
    其次是，这本小册子的编写和出版，向人们具体表明了在我们祖国丰富的历史文化典籍中，确实有着不少的唯物主义的思想精华，只要我们的古籍整理出版工作者，真正作到了政治挂帅，贯彻执行厚今薄古的方针，那么就能够使古为今用。在某种程度上说，这本小册子的出版，也为我们整理和出版古籍，打开了一条新的道路，指出了一个新的方向。虽然整理和出版古籍，并不仅限于这个方面和这个途径，但是作为一种方向，是值得提倡的。
    当然，“破除迷信”这本小册子，也并不是十全十美的，它还有一些明显的缺陷。这种缺陷的重要表现之一，就是它对于最广大的读者对象——农民，还注意得不够；它在介绍和叙述中国古代无神论的思想的时候，在编写反对迷信的历史故事的时候，还没有摆脱尽所谓“哲学史”的羁绊，更坦率些说，就是它还流露着不少的书生气。例如，对于神的起源，对于剥削阶级利用神鬼作为巩固其反动统治的工具，这些道理，只是在前言里引用了“红旗”杂志第六期上一篇文章中的几句话，而没有深入浅出地加以说明。在故事的编写上，也多是就故事讲故事，而没有把这些历史上的反迷信故事和当前的实际生活有机地联系起来。实际上，在这方面很多问题是可以而且应该联系起来进行宣传解释的。例如：农业社因为并大社、建立人民公社，须要平整土地而发生的迁坟的问题；利用乡村中过去的庙宇、祠堂作校舍、办公室等问题；农村中反动道会门、反革命分子、坏分子利用迷信神鬼进行破坏活动和扰乱社会治安的问题；兴修水利、抗旱斗争胜利与过去的拜神求雨的问题；捕灭虫灾与过去的所谓“神虫”问题；消灭严重的地方病（如血吸虫病，疟疾等）与过去的所谓“天灾”、“瘟神”问题；过去流行在人民群众中的各种各样的神怪的名目和来历（如火神、瘟神、山神、土地、雷公、风婆、菩萨、财神、灶神、门神等等）的问题等等，都可以在书中加以通俗的揭破，拔掉它们的虚妄的老根，使它们在人们的头脑中再无立足之地。在文字语言上，本书虽然比较地注意了通俗，但在具体的表达上，往往显得语言的单调和呆板，很少注意运用群众的生动的语言。这就不能不在一定程度上削弱了这本书的实际效果。此外，这本书在讲历史上无神论的理论时，只从先秦的晏子、荀子，讲到南北朝的范缜，而对于自唐迄清末这一段很长的历史时期的无神论思想的代表人物都没有提及，这也是一个美中不足之处。
    这本小册子，虽然还有这些缺点，但正如前面所说，它是当前所需要的，它的方向也是正确的。我们热切地希望哲学家们，特别是搞中国哲学史的同志们，沿着党所指出的方向，为人民不断地做出更大更好的贡献。
