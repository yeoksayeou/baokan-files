The Volunteer Army—Witness to the Paper Tiger
Wang Ping, Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

On this day of the triumphant return of the Volunteer Army, reading Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant document on imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers, and recalling the eight-year experience of resisting America and aiding Korea, feels exceptionally personal and inspires even greater confidence. The victory of the Volunteer Army in Korea in severely defeating the American bandits is the victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought; the eight years of practice of the Volunteer Army has also proven the complete correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis with living facts.

The United States, claiming to be the leader of the capitalist world, used one-third of its army (and concentrated ace elites such as the 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Cavalry Division), one-fifth of its air force, and most of its navy in the Korean War merely to deal with the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In three years, it used almost all of its latest weapons, from napalm bombs to germ bombs, except for atomic bombs. It adopted various tactics, from lightning attacks and magnetic warfare to copying our tunnel fortifications. It paid the price of consuming over 20 billion US dollars in war expenses, over 73 million tons of war materials, and 390,000 American casualties. It changed its commander three times, repeatedly suffered defeats and repeatedly fought. In the end, it was beaten back to the starting point of launching the war. Not only could it not advance a single step, but the battle line moved further and further south, and it was finally forced to sign the armistice. If it were not outwardly strong but inwardly weak, outwardly fierce but inwardly timid, how else could all this be explained? The Korean War ruthlessly exposed the American paper tiger and played a role in dispelling superstition and boosting morale among all the people in the world who have suffered from American aggression and oppression.

However, even today, some people still harbor fear of American imperialism. Their minds have not yet been liberated. The fundamental reason is that they only look at the surface when observing problems, without examining the essence; they only see things, without seeing people; they are fixated on the temporary comparison of strength and weakness, without investigating the ebb and flow of long-term development. This superficial, one-sided, and static way of looking at problems is the reason why they keep making mistakes on this issue.

Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers contains three inseparable and dialectically interconnected basic contents: first, it is said that imperialism and all reactionaries have no future because they are divorced from the people and are bound to fail; however, second, they still have power now, and they will still carry out their final struggle before dying. Therefore, we must despise the enemy strategically, placing them in an insignificant position, but we must pay attention to them tactically. We must firmly believe that we can eliminate imperialism like eating a meal, but we must eat it bite by bite, and we cannot suffer from the acute illness of swallowing it in one gulp. Finally, and very importantly, only by believing in the people and relying on the people can we defeat the strong with the weak, transform the weak into the strong, and finally expose the enemy's paper tiger.

When the U.S. military frantically advanced north in October 1950, and shells had already hit our Northeast territory, from the surface, the situation at that time was very unfavorable. The strength of the enemy and ourselves was very disparate. The Volunteer Army, with very few cannons and without a single plane or tank, hastily crossed the river to participate in the war and confront the U.S. military with its naval and air superiority and first-class technical equipment. Friends at home and abroad were worried about this. However, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, perceiving the weak essence of the seemingly powerful American imperialism, and deeply believing in the determination and strength of the working people, who had become masters of the country, to defend the motherland and aid neighboring countries, decisively made the wise decision to resist America and aid Korea. The Volunteer Army, ridiculed by arrogant American generals for fighting a modern war with medieval supplies, seized upon the U.S. military's weaknesses of being afraid of close combat, night combat, and encirclement and outflanking to cut off the rear, as well as their arrogance and underestimation of the enemy due to their advanced separation of forces, and adopted a strategy based on mobile warfare, boldly implementing penetration and division, encirclement and outflanking, and quickly annihilating the enemy in motion. As a result, the Battle of Yunshan was a successful start, and then, in several offensive campaigns, the U.S. military, which had already reached the Yalu River, was driven back south of the 38th parallel, reversing the situation. The U.S. military, which had been flexing its muscles and boasting that it would end the Korean War before Thanksgiving (November 23), now revealed its paper tiger form.

After the continuous victories in the initial offensive operations after going abroad, we soberly estimated that American imperialism still had power, that it still possessed the undeniable advantages of the sea, air, and artillery, and that it would inevitably not be reconciled to defeat and would fight back desperately. Therefore, based on the technical equipment conditions of the enemy and ourselves at that time and the characteristics of the Korean terrain, we switched from mobile warfare to positional warfare and adopted a strategy of relying on mountainous areas to build solid fortifications and actively defend. In response to the threat posed by the enemy's air and artillery superiority, we began to construct a defense system with tunnel fortifications as the backbone. At the same time, we carefully studied the enemy's situation, mastered the enemy's activity patterns, and under the slogan of "the enemy changes, we change," and "fight a battle, advance a step," we carried out activities such as killing the enemy with cold shots and cold cannons, annihilating the enemy with small units, and preparing to gradually seize the enemy's protruding positions. In this way, the focus of the struggle was gradually pushed from our front line to the enemy's front line. Originally, the enemy relied on its air and artillery superiority to suppress and blockade our positions, making it almost impossible for us to move around during the day. Now, the enemy was afraid to raise its head during the day due to our cold shots and cold cannons, and at night it was afraid to go out due to the unpredictable ambushes and raids of our small units. The enemy changed from madness and arrogance to panic and passivity. In every battle to seize the enemy's protruding positions, we went through very careful and repeated reconnaissance. We would not fight unless we were sure of winning, and we were sure to win every battle. Finally, we accumulated small victories into big victories, depleted the enemy, and shifted the battle line to the south. If we had not paid attention to the enemy tactically and treated the enemy as a real tiger in every specific battle, it would have been impossible to truly despise the enemy strategically and finally expose the paper tiger's true form.

In terms of the weapons and technical conditions of the two armies, the enemy not only had an absolute advantage in the early stages of the war, but even on the eve of the armistice, it still held a huge advantage. The most fundamental reason why we were able to defeat the superior with the inferior and become stronger as we fought was the truth that it is people, not things, and politics, not technology, that determine the outcome of war. From beginning to end, we fully exploited the subjective initiative of people. We did not disregard the role of weapons, but we believed more in the people who mastered and used these weapons. Our people were all people with a high degree of awareness and a high degree of internationalist spirit. They also understood that the enemy possessed an absolute advantage in technical equipment, but everyone offered ideas and thought of ways to find the enemy's weaknesses from their strengths, avoid the enemy's strengths and attack their weaknesses, and avoid our weaknesses and use our strengths. In this way, the miracles of turning weakness into strength and defeating the strong with the weak appeared one after another on the Korean battlefield from the infinite wisdom of the broad masses. For example, after entering positional warfare, in response to the enemy's air and artillery superiority, we developed and summarized the inventions of the masses, creating tunnel fortifications and tunnel tactics that had never existed in the world. And when the enemy also built tunnel fortifications, and our firepower was far weaker than the enemy's, we created a set of tactics for attacking the enemy's tunnels by hiding large troops in front of the enemy and combining military and political efforts, turning the enemy into "turtles in a jar" in their own tunnels. The same tunnels, in our hands and in the enemy's hands, played completely opposite roles. Does this not better illustrate the essence of the enemy's paper tiger? No amount of good weapons or strong fortifications could save their fate.

A few years ago, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, the Volunteer Army exposed the American paper tiger in the war. Today, with the U.S. military continuing to occupy southern Korea, the Volunteer Army has completely withdrawn from Korea, once again exposing the essence of American imperialism as a paper tiger. American imperialism can only rely on the bayonets of its invading troops to maintain its dark rule in southern Korea with its lackeys. This fact precisely proves its weakness, proves its doubts about the Syngman Rhee puppet regime and its own strength, and proves its fear of the growing socialist construction in the democratic base of northern Korea and the growing anti-American sentiment among the people in southern Korea. Isn't this the case? With the east wind of socialism and peace growing stronger day by day and capitalism declining in the west, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, there is no reason to harbor any superstition about the American imperialism that frightens people with atomic bombs. The day when this paper tiger disappears from the face of the earth is getting closer and closer!

    志愿军——纸老虎的见证人
    中国人民志愿军政治委员　王平
    在志愿军胜利归国的今天，读毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎这篇辉煌的文献，回顾八年抗美援朝斗争的经历，实在是异常亲切而又信心倍增。志愿军在朝鲜痛击美国强盗的胜利，就是毛泽东同志这一思想的胜利；志愿军八年的实践，又以活生生的事实证明了毛泽东同志这一论断的完全正确。
    号称资本主义世界首领的美国，在朝鲜战争中仅仅为了对付朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，就使用了它的陆军的三分之一（而且集中了陆一师、骑一师这样的王牌精锐），空军的五分之一，以及海军的大部，在三年时间中，除原子弹以外几乎用尽了从凝固汽油弹到细菌弹的一切最新式武器，采取了从闪电攻击、磁性战术直到搬用我们的坑道工事等各种打法；付出了消耗战费二百亿美元以上、作战物资七千三百万吨以上，和伤亡三十九万美军的代价，三易其主帅，屡败而屡战；结果还是被打回到原来发动战争的起点，不但一步前进不得，反而愈打战线愈加南移，终于不得不被迫签字停战。如果不是外强中干，色厉内荏，又如何解释这一切？朝鲜战争就这样无情地戳穿了美国的纸老虎，在全世界一切遭受美国侵略与压迫的人民中起了破除迷信、鼓舞斗志的作用。
    但是，今天也还有一些人对美帝国主义怀有畏惧的心理。他们的思想还没有解放。其根本原因就在于他们在观察问题的时候，只看表面，不察本质，只见物，不见人，固着于一时的强弱对比，而不究长远发展中的消长变化。这种表面的，片面的，静止的看问题的方法，就是使他们老是在这个问题上犯错误的原因。
    毛泽东同志关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断，包含着三个不可分割的辩证地互相联系着的基本内容：第一是说帝国主义和一切反动派由于他们脱离人民，所以是没有前途的，一定要失败的；但是，第二，他们现在还是有力量的，他们在临死之前，还是要进行最后的挣扎的；因此，我们对敌人，在战略上要藐视它，把它放在不在话下的位置，在战术上则要重视它。要坚定地相信我们能像吃饭一样地消灭掉帝国主义，但是却必须是一口一口的吃，而不能犯一口吞下去的急性病。最后，还有非常重要的一条，就是只有相信人民，依靠人民，才可以以弱敌强，化弱为强，从而最后戳穿敌人的纸老虎。
    当1950年10月美军疯狂向北推进，炮弹已经打到我东北领土上的时候，从表面看来，当时战局十分不利，敌我力量悬殊，很少大炮，没有一架飞机和一辆坦克的志愿军，匆促过江参战，迎击具有海空优势、头等技术装备的美军。国内外的朋友都为此而担心。但是党中央和毛主席洞察貌似强大的美帝国主义的虚弱的本质，深信当了国家主人翁的劳动人民保卫祖国援助邻邦的决心与力量，当机立断，作出了抗美援朝的英明决策。被骄傲的美国将军们嘲笑为用中世纪的供应来打现代化战争的志愿军，抓住美军是怕近战，怕夜战，怕迂回包围断后，以及当时分兵冒进骄傲轻敌的弱点，采取以运动战为主的方针，大胆实施穿插分割，迂回包围，在运动中速决歼敌。结果云山一战，旗开得胜，接着几个攻势战役，就把已经打到鸭绿江边的美军，赶回到三八线以南，扭转了战局。不久前还耀武扬威，夸口要在感恩节（11月23日）前结束朝鲜战争的美军，这时就显出了纸老虎的原形了。
    在出国初期几个攻势作战的连续胜利以后，我们清醒地估计到：美帝国主义还是有力量的，它还具有着不可忽视的海、空、炮的优势，它必然不甘心于失败而还要拚命反扑。因此，我们根据当时敌我技术装备条件和朝鲜地形特点，由运动战转入阵地战，采取依托山地构筑坚固工事，积极防御的方针。针对敌空炮优势给予我的威胁，开始构筑以坑道工事为骨干的防御体系，同时，认真研究敌情，掌握敌人活动规律，在“敌变我变”，“打一仗进一步”的口号下，开展了冷枪冷炮杀敌、小部队歼敌、和有准备地逐个夺取敌人突出阵地等活动。这样，就把斗争焦点由我方前沿逐渐推向了敌人前沿。原来是敌人依靠空炮优势压制封锁我阵地，使我几乎在白天无法活动，现在是敌人白天被我冷枪冷炮打得不敢抬头，夜晚被我小部队神出鬼没的伏击、袭击吓得不敢出门，敌人由疯狂嚣张一变而为恐慌、被动。在每一次夺取敌突出阵地的战斗中都经过十分慎重的反复侦察，不战则已，每战必胜。终于积小胜为大胜，消耗了敌人，使战线南移。如果不是在战术上重视敌人，在一个个具体战斗中把敌人当作真老虎打，也就不可能做到在战略上真正藐视敌人，而最后叫纸老虎显出原形。
    就两军的武器和技术条件而论，敌人不但在战争初期占有绝对优势，就是在停战前夕，也还是掌握着巨大优势的。我们所以能够以劣胜优，愈战愈强，最根本的在于决定战争胜负的是人而不是物，是政治而不是技术这样一个真理。我们自始至终充分发挥了人的主观能动性。我们并不是不重视武器的作用，但是我们更相信掌握和使用这些武器的人。我们的人，都是有高度觉悟的人，有高度国际主义精神的人，他们也都明白，敌人占有技术装备上的绝对优势，但是，大家出主意、想办法，从敌人长处中找出短处，避敌之长而攻敌之短，避我所短而用我所长。这样，化弱为强、以弱胜强的奇迹，在广大群众无穷智慧中，就一个接一个地出现在朝鲜战场上了。例如，在进入阵地战后，针对敌人空炮优势，我们发扬与总结了群众的发明，创造出了世界上从未有过的坑道工事和坑道战术；而在敌人也构筑起坑道工事，而我火力远较敌人为弱的情况下，又创造了敌前大部队潜伏，和军事政治相结合的打敌坑道的一套战术，使敌人在它自己的坑道中成了“瓮中之鳖”。同样是坑道，在我们手中和在敌人手中，就起了完全相反的作用，这不更好地说明敌人的纸老虎的本质吗？再好的武器，再强的工事，也无法挽救它们的命运。
    几年前，志愿军在毛泽东同志的思想指导下，在战争中戳穿了美国纸老虎；今天，志愿军在美军继续盘踞朝鲜南部的情况下，全部撤出朝鲜，又一次暴露了美帝国主义纸老虎的实质。美帝国主义只能依靠其侵略军队的刺刀尖，才能维持它和它的奴才在朝鲜南部的黑暗统治。这一事实，恰恰证明了它的虚弱，证明了它对李承晚傀儡统治和对自己力量的怀疑，证明了它对朝鲜北部民主基地社会主义建设的日益发展，对朝鲜南部人民反美情绪的日益增长的恐惧。事实不正是如此吗？在社会主义和和平的东风日猛，资本主义日落西山，回顾过去，展望将来，再没有理由对拿着原子弹吓人的美帝国主义抱有任何迷信了。这个纸老虎被从地面上消失的日子，越来越近了！
