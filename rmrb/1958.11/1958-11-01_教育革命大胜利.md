The "Exhibition of Combining Education with Productive Labor" displays a large number of new products, scientific research achievements, scientific papers, and works of art, clearly showing the tremendous changes taking place in education in our country. The old educational tradition of separating theory from practice, mental from physical labor is being broken down, and a communist education system that combines theory with practice, mental with physical labor is being established. In the past six months, this fundamental reform in teaching carried out by schools in various regions is a mass education revolution under the leadership of the Party, and a serious struggle between two lines and two methods.

Fundamental Differences

The teaching reform section of the exhibition introduces the anti-rightist struggle, followed by an exhibit from Peking University depicting a student who learned the motto "Genius plus hard work equals greatness" from a teacher, taking the white and expert road, and consequently falling headfirst into a pile of paper, half-submerged, before being rescued by the Party and embarking on the correct path. Is this an isolated case? No! In the exhibits from various faculties, including arts, law, science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, there are a large number of capitalist ideological viewpoints in various forms, poisoning young people through the mouths of bourgeois experts.

In the exhibits from the arts, we can see the serious phenomenon of valuing the past over the present in the old teaching methods. On many statistical charts, the gray line representing "the past" is so high, while the red line representing "the present" is so low, generally in a ratio of four to one. The exhibit from the Chinese Department of Peking University introduces a "Chu Ci expert" who argues that "Qu Yuan was an abandoned woman, pursuing a carefree immortal life." This "expert" even researches the wife, daughter, son-in-law, and nephew of the mythological River God. An exhibit from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music depicts a teacher's motto: "The erhu sounds like a chicken, the violin is wonderful; the pipa is for brushing the toilet, the piano is worth a lot." There are many similar examples. The phenomenon of valuing foreign things over local things, valuing capitalist countries over socialist countries, is particularly serious in the sciences, engineering, medicine, and agriculture. Such examples are countless in the exhibition. Look at the exhibit from the Architecture Department of Tsinghua University. The picture records a professor openly saying that the architecture of capitalist countries is "God's pearls, which the working people will not appreciate architectural art," and that "the architecture after liberation should be beaten." They even plagiarize residential designs from American magazines, even dividing the stairs into two for "masters" and "servants." The sciences, engineering, agriculture, and medicine are inherently the most scientific, but from the many materials exhibited, it is clear that some teachers are teaching the most unscientific things, outdated and backward, repetitive and incomplete. From the large number of facts exhibited, it can be seen that many disciplines are teaching old textbooks from more than a decade or even thirty years ago, turning a blind eye to the latest scientific achievements, some of which have been tested in practice and found to be pseudo-science.

From the exhibits, it can be seen that all disciplines have a common problem, which is that they start from one-sided teaching and emphasize book knowledge, despising practical labor knowledge. The students taught are incompetent in both literary and military affairs, learning chemistry without being able to analyze, learning electrical engineering without being able to connect fuses, and learning agricultural machinery without understanding combine harvesters. Such examples cannot be listed one by one in the exhibition. As one exhibit says, "What kind of teacher, what kind of student." An exhibit from Peking Medical College introduces some students who, while still in school, look forward to the future "three bigs (big cities, big hospitals, big doctors), three smalls (small western-style houses, small families, small cars)," and are unwilling to go to the countryside. Some young people also follow teachers on the white and expert road, falling into the anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist mire. Although these are a minority, they are enough to be shocking. These problems have been gradually exposed with the victory of the rectification campaign, the implementation of the Party's general line and education policy, the large-scale descent of teachers and students to the countryside and mountains, and then the establishment of factories and farms by schools, thus launching a new teaching reform movement.

A Serious Struggle

Teaching reform is also a struggle between two lines and two methods. Bourgeois experts only want to make minor repairs, while the masses want revolution, not reform. Under the leadership of the Party, schools in various regions have broken out of the old framework and made great breakthroughs through the three-way combination method.

Here, under titles such as "Ignite the raging fire of teaching reform and burn away all kinds of bourgeois ideas," are exhibited some major battles in the teaching reform of schools in various regions in recent months. From the exhibited photos and text descriptions, we can also see the heated debates everywhere in the playgrounds, classrooms, and auditoriums at that time, as well as the big-character posters and exhibitions. Renmin University of China mobilized the masses to conduct "five investigations": investigate listening notes, investigate classroom discussion summaries, investigate teaching outlines and reference books, investigate lecture notes and manuscripts, and investigate teachers' papers, thoroughly liquidating dogmatism and exposing and criticizing revisionism and various bourgeois ideas.

As the debate deepened, the masses further liberated their minds and inevitably came into contact with some "authorities" who were usually worshiped as idols, pulling out big white flags in the academic field. From the exhibits from various regions, it can be seen that at the beginning, these "authorities" did not care, looking down on the strength of the Party and the masses, and raising various difficult questions such as "What are the four great gods?" and "How much stuff is in your belly?" trying to scare the masses. However, under the leadership of the Party, the masses bravely challenged the cutting-edge "authorities" of the old teaching methods. Here are exhibited the express reports and articles of teachers and students of the Philosophy Department of Peking University and the idealist philosopher Feng Youlan, as well as Feng Youlan's own works. Under the title "Newborn calves are not afraid of tigers," it introduces in detail how teachers and students, under the leadership of the Party, worked collectively and used Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and methods to write 56 critical papers in half a month, breaking Feng Youlan's idealist philosophical system. Now Mr. Feng Youlan has expressed his willingness to conduct self-criticism.

Some departments and faculties of some schools went to practice to carry out teaching reform. Here are also exhibited many vivid examples. Jilin Normal University exhibited that more than 900 people from the school's education and other three departments went to the countryside to participate in the cultural revolution, and from June to August, they established 5,019 schools of various types in 27 counties, compiled 222 kinds of teaching materials in teaching practice, and explored the way of teaching reform. People reflected that there are "four combinations" and "five benefits." The four combinations are: combining work, study, labor, and research; the five benefits are: learning living knowledge, getting all-round training, etc. The exhibited activities of the "field combat regiment" of the Physics Department of Peking University during the summer vacation to work in factories, pictures and text introductions, 250 students solved 645 production technical problems in one month, and gained a double harvest of labor and thought.

Bourgeois experts originally believed that the Party and the masses would not succeed in carrying out teaching reform, but now their "predictions" have all fallen through. The thousands of newly compiled teaching outlines and textbooks exhibited at the exhibition answered them.

Very Good

Bourgeois experts oppose the Party's education policy, believing that education cannot be combined with productive labor. What about now? Groups of materials at the exhibition show that schools in various regions have fundamentally changed the old tradition of teaching only "books" and not practice in the past. Teaching not only arranges teaching plans for professional courses but also strengthens political courses and arranges labor plans, listing labor as a formal course. Schools have set up factories and farms, and teachers and students have gone to factories, the countryside, and the mountains. Some schools or departments have moved to the countryside to run schools. Looking at the situation of schools in various regions exhibited, the arrangement of annual holidays, labor, and teaching time is generally "1 (month) —3 (month) —8 (month)" or "1—4—7." Many schools, including some universities, have gradually changed to a part-work, part-study system. According to the materials exhibited by Jilin University, all nine departments and eleven majors of the school have made great breakthroughs and thoroughly changed, and have built factories for teaching according to the five systems of smelting, mechanical and electrical machinery, chemical industry, cutting-edge products, and building materials, and have basically implemented the new school system of part-work and part-study.

Bourgeois experts also said: Reform will lead to "chaos" and "bad results." What is the situation now? At the exhibition, we have already seen many real "chaos" and "bad results" in the old teaching methods of bourgeois experts, and although the new teaching methods have not been around for long and inevitably still have shortcomings, they are fundamentally very good! In the various exhibition rooms of the teaching reform section, people can see a large number of comparisons between the old and new teaching methods. Not only has the phenomenon of valuing the past over the present in the arts been fundamentally changed, but also the unreasonable things in science and engineering have been preliminarily corrected.

The old teaching method was to teach books behind closed doors, with teachers lecturing on articles and students copying and memorizing articles. After studying, they were "unwilling to work with their hands and unable to distinguish the five grains," seriously divorced from reality. Taking agricultural colleges as an example, they used to be located in cities, and in the classroom, they talked about varieties and insects with dead specimens, and talked about Australian black chickens and Dutch cows for domestic animals and poultry. Even rabbits and pigs were talked about from foreign countries, turning the school into a "foreign goods exhibition hall." As a result, the broad masses of farmers released one high-yield satellite after another in the Great Leap Forward, and foreign experts were stunned. Now, more than 30 agricultural colleges are going to move to the countryside to run schools, work with farmers, cultivate high-yield fields, and learn to create a new Chinese-style agricultural science system. Here is a group of exhibits from Hunan Agricultural College, which was the earliest to be sent down. The scientific research of this college was only 90 items last year, but it has had 800 items in half a year since being sent down. Before being sent down, there were only 300 papers and reports in seven years, but 4,600 have been produced in half a year since being sent down, and 40% of the people have been rated as labor models. Mathematics has always been considered the "queen of science," and "pure theory" cannot serve production. However, the mathematics departments of Peking University, Nanjing University, Nankai University, and Beijing Normal University exhibited that they collected more than 900 problems from practice and the masses in more than a month, and have solved 329 items, some of which are quite important achievements in mathematics and have been incorporated into new textbooks. Many people say that there is no way for liberal arts to combine with productive labor, but here are exhibited a batch of works such as mining history, factory history, port history, and Soviet area party history surveys, all of which are masterpieces made by students from the history departments of several universities who recently went to factories, mines, and the countryside to participate in labor and conduct investigations and research from the masses. The exhibition room has a batch of "folk song collections," which are products of the Chinese Department of the University's productive labor. The exhibit from the Central South Conservatory of Music made a clear comparison: in the past four years, there were 35 performances with 30,000 audiences, but in the past six months, there have been 454 performances with 350,000 audiences. The exhibit uses eye-catching red letters to write "One year is equal to 103 years." More importantly, it is the harvest in political thought, as summarized by a professor from Central China Normal College in a few words: "Educational investigation has strengthened my three loves (love for the Party, love for the countryside and peasant children, love for education), and strengthened the three requirements (to transform ideas, to reform teaching, and to strengthen teachers' sense of responsibility)."

The old teaching tradition has always been monopolized by experts. Some fake experts do not have real skills, but they still insist that students accept him. Now this tradition has also been broken. Many schools exhibited on-site mutual teaching and learning, and learning from capable people. We can see the photo of Ning Huatang, a new professor who has been herding sheep for 40 years at Shanxi Agricultural College, receiving an appointment letter from the school and teaching students and foreign experts on-site. The Shanghai Fisheries College exhibited the scene of teachers and students going to fishing areas to learn from fishermen and on-site teaching. In a short period of time, they formulated 216 teaching outlines and 22 textbooks, and the scientific research projects completed in ten days were equal to 16 and a half times the total of the past five years.

This great education revolution has achieved initial victory, breaking the old and establishing the new, breaking the old tradition of separating physical and mental labor for thousands of years, and establishing a communist education system that combines physical and mental labor. In this struggle, because it is a principled and fundamental difference, the struggle is also very serious. In schools in various regions, the movement is gradually deepening, further breaking the old and establishing the new, thoroughly implementing the Party's education policy, and moving towards the goal of communist education. This is a struggle between two lines and two methods, and it must be carried out to the end to achieve a complete victory! (Attached pictures)

    教育革命大胜利
    本报记者　魏文华
    在“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”上，陈列着大量新产品、科学研究成果、科学论文、艺术作品等，清楚地显示出我国教育在发生着巨大的变化。脱离实际的体力劳动和脑力劳动分离的旧教育传统在破除，联系实际的体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的共产主义教育体系正在建立。半年来，各地学校在教学上所进行的这一根本性改革，是在党的领导下一场群众性的教育革命，一场严肃的两条道路两种方法的斗争。
    根本的分歧
    展览会教学改革部分在介绍了反右派斗争后，紧接着有北京大学的一件展品，画着一个学生从教师那里学了“天才加勤奋等于伟大”这样一个格言，走白专道路，结果两脚朝天栽到纸堆中，沉没了半个身子，经党挽救才走上了正确的道路。这是个别的事例吗？不！在各展览馆展出的文、法、理、工、农、医各科的旧教学，都有大量的形形色色的资本主义思想观点，通过资产阶级专家之口毒害青年。
    在文科的展品中，我们可以看到旧教学严重的厚古薄今现象，在许多幅统计图上，代表“古”的灰线是那么高，代表“现代”的红线又是那么低，一般都成四与一之比。北京大学中文系展品介绍一位“楚辞专家”，考证“屈原是弃妇，追求逍遥的活神仙”，这位“专家”还为神话中的河伯考证妻子、女儿、女婿、外甥是谁等等。上海音乐学院展品画着一位教师的格言是：“二胡像鸡叫，提琴真美妙；琵琶刷马桶，钢琴身价高”。类似这样的事例还很多。理工医农各科重洋轻土、重资本主义国家轻社会主义国家的现象，尤其严重，展出中这样的事例也是不胜枚举。请看清华大学建筑系的展品，画面上记载一位教授公开讲资本主义国家的建筑是“上帝的珍珠，劳动人民不会欣赏建筑艺术”，“解放后的建筑该挨揍”，他们设计住宅也要从美国杂志上抄袭，连楼梯都要分为“主”、“仆”分用的两个。理工农医这些学科本是科学性最强的，但从展出的许多材料看到，偏偏有些教师讲些最不科学的东西，陈旧落后，重复遗漏，从展出的大量事实中看到，许多学科讲的是十几年前甚至三十多年前的旧教材，对现代最新的科学成就是熟视无睹，有的在实际中检验并发现是伪科学。
    从展品中可以看到，所有的学科，有一个共同的问题，就是从片面教书出发的，重书本知识，卑视劳动实践知识，所教学生文不成武不就，学了化学不会分析，学了电工不会接保险丝，学了农业机械不懂联合收割机，在展览会上这样的事例不能一一列举。正如有一幅展品所说的“有什么先生，就有什么学生”。北京医学院展品介绍有的学生在学校中就盼着未来“三大（大城市、大医院、大大夫）、三小（小洋房、小家庭、小汽车）”，不愿到农村去。也有一些青年跟着教师走白专道路，掉进反党反社会主义的右派泥坑。以上虽然是少数，但也足以令人触目惊心了。这些问题，随着整风胜利，贯彻党的总路线和教育方针，学校师生大批下乡上山，进而在学校大办工厂农场，逐步地暴露出来，因而掀起了新的教学改革运动。
    严肃的斗争
    教学改革也是两条道路两种方法的斗争，资产阶级专家只要修修补补，群众要革命不要改良。各地学校在党的领导下，通过三结合的办法，跳出旧框框，大破大立。
    这里在类如“燃起教学改革的熊熊烈火，烧掉形形色色资产阶级思想”的标题下，展出了各地学校最近几个月来在教学改革中的一些重大战役。从展出的照片文字说明还可以看到当时人们在操场、教室、礼堂各处热烈辩论以及所出大字报举办展览会等情况。中国人民大学发动群众进行“五查”：查听课笔记、查课堂讨论小结、查教学大纲和参考书目、查讲义讲稿、查教员论文，彻底地清算教条主义，揭露批判了修正主义和各种资产阶级思想。
    当辩论深入的时候，群众进一步解放了思想，不可避免地接触到一些平常被作为偶像一样崇拜的“权威”，从学术领域内拔大白旗。从各地展品可以看到，在开始时这些
  “权威”都是不在乎的，轻蔑地看待党和群众的力量，提出各种难题如“四大神物是什么”、“你们肚里有多少货”等，想把群众吓倒。但群众在党的领导下，勇敢地向旧教学的尖端“权威”挑战。这里陈列着北京大学哲学系师生和唯心主义哲学家冯友兰论战的快报、文章以及冯友兰本人的著作，在“初生之犊不畏虎”的标题下面，详细介绍了师生们在党领导下集体努力，运用马克思列宁主义观点方法，半个月中写出批判论文五十六篇，击破了冯友兰的唯心主义哲学体系。现在冯友兰先生表示愿意进行自我批判。
    有一些学校的系科，到实际中去进行教学改革。这里也展出了不少生动的事例。吉林师范大学展出了该校教育等三个系九百多人下乡参加文化革命，从6月到8月在二十七个县办起各类学校五千零一十九所，在教学实践中编成二百二十二种教材，探求到教学改革的途径，人们反映有“四结合”、“五好处”，四结合是：把工作、学习、劳动、研究结合起来；五好处是：学到活的知识，得到多方面锻炼等等。展出的北京大学物理系暑期“野战兵团”下工厂劳动的活动，图片和文字介绍说明，二百五十个同学一个月中解决了生产技术问题六百四十五项，得到劳动思想双丰收。
    资产阶级专家原来认为党和群众搞教学改革不会成功，现在他们的“预言”全部落空了，展览会上成千本新编的教学大纲、教材，回答了他们。
    好得很
    资产阶级专家反对党的教育方针，认为教育与生产劳动不可能结合。现在怎样呢？展览会一组一组的材料说明，各地学校都对过去片面教“书”不要实践的旧传统作了根本的改变，教学中不但安排业务课的教学计划，还加强了政治课，安排了劳动计划，把劳动列为正式课程。学校办起了工厂、农场，师生们下厂下乡上山，有的学校或系科搬到农村去办。从展出的各地学校情况看，每年放假、劳动、教学时间的安排，一般是“1（月）—3（月）—8（月）”或“1—4—7”，不少学校包括部分高等学校在内逐步改为半工半读。展出的吉林大学材料，全校九个系，十一个专业大破大立，一改到底，按照冶炼、机械电机、化工、尖端产品、建筑材料等五个体系建厂教学，基本上实行了半工半读的新学制。
    资产阶级专家又说：会改“乱”改“糟”。现在情况怎样呢？在展览会上我们已经看到了资产阶级专家旧教学中许多真正的“乱”和“糟”，而新的教学虽然时间还不长，也难免还有缺点，但根本上是好得很！教学改革部分各个陈列室，人们都可以看到新旧教学的大量对比，不但文科厚古薄今的现象得到根本改变，就是理工科也初步纠正了不合理的东西。
    旧教学是关门教书，先生讲条文，学生抄书背条文，学到头是“四体不勤，五谷不分”，严重地脱离实际。以农学院为例，过去设在城市里，在课堂上就死标本讲品种、昆虫，讲家畜家禽是澳洲黑鸡，荷兰牛，连兔子和猪也是讲外国的，把学校办成“洋物陈列所”，以致广大农民在大跃进中放出一颗一颗的高额丰产卫星，洋专家们个个目瞪口呆；现在三十多所农学院要全部搬到乡下去办，和农民一起劳动，培育丰产田，学着创造中国新型的中国式农业科学系统。这里有下放最早的湖南农学院的一组展品，这个学院的科学研究，去年一年只有九十项，今年下放半年即有八百项；论文报告，下放以前七年只有三百篇，现在下放半年即作出四千六百篇，还有40％的人被评为劳动模范。数学一向被认为是“科学的皇后”，“纯理论”不能为生产服务，但展出的北京大学、南京大学、南开大学、北京师范大学四校的数学系，一个多月中即从实际和群众中收集了九百多个问题，已解决三百二十九项，有一些是数学上相当重要的成果，已编入新教材。许多人说文科没有办法结合生产劳动，但这里展出的一批矿史、厂史、港口史、苏区党史调查等著作，都是几个大学历史系的学生最近下厂下矿下乡参加劳动从群众中调查研究作出的杰作。陈列室有一批“采风集”、“民歌集”等，是大学中文系生产劳动的产品。中南音乐专科学校的展品作了一个显明的对比，过去四年演出三十五场，观众三万人，最近半年就已演出四百五十四场，观众三十五万人，展品用醒目的红字写着“一年等于103年”。更重要的是政治思想上的收获，正如展出的华中师范学院一位教授所总结的几句话：“教育调查使我加强了三热爱（热爱党，热爱农村和农民子弟，热爱教育事业），加强了三要（要改造思想，要改革教学，要加强教师责任感）。”
    旧的教学传统一向是专家们包办的，有些冒牌专家并没有真实本事，也硬要学生接受他的，现在这一传统也被打破。展出的许多学校实行现场互教互学，拜能人为师。我们可以看到山西农学院曾牧羊四十年的新教授宁华堂收到学校的聘书，他在现场为学生和洋专家们上课的照片说明。上海水产学院展出了师生们下渔区拜渔民为师和现场教学的情景。他们在短短的时间内制订了二百一十六份教学大纲和二十二本教材，十天中完成的科学研究项目就等于过去五年总和的十六倍半
    这一场教育大革命，目前已取得了初步胜利，破旧立新，破糟立好，破除几千年体力劳动和脑力劳动分离的旧传统，建立体力劳动和脑力劳动结合的共产主义教育体系。这一场斗争中，由于是原则性的根本的分歧，所以斗争也是十分严肃的。在各地学校，运动正在逐步深入，进一步地破旧立新，彻底贯彻党的教育方针，向共产主义教育目标迈进。这是两条道路两种方法的斗争，必须进行到底，取得全胜！（附图片）
