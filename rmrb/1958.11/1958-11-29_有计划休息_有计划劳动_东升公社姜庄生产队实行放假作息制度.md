　　Planned Rest, Planned Labor
　　Jiangzhuang Production Team of Dongsheng Commune Implements a Vacation and Work System

　　(Our dispatch) The Jiangzhuang Production Team of the Dongsheng People's Commune in Dongguang County, Hebei Province, has implemented a vacation and work system. Amidst the intense labor, members have gotten sufficient rest on holidays, everyone is in good spirits, and their enthusiasm has greatly increased. Production efficiency has greatly improved, and all aspects of production are a step ahead of other production teams.

　　Since the Great Leap Forward in production, all members of the Jiangzhuang Production Team have been full of energy. In order to complete various production tasks, members have been working day and night to complete their tasks. To ensure that the members' production enthusiasm is sustained, the Party branch, after consulting with the masses, formulated a vacation and work system. It stipulates that members are guaranteed eight hours of sleep every day, four to six hours for eating, walking, and entertainment, and ten to twelve hours for labor. A half-day holiday is given every half month, and the public canteen improves meals for everyone. This system has been in effect since August 24th, and three months of practice have proven that this system has many benefits.

　　The implementation of the vacation and rest system has also brought the household labor of the members into a planned manner, greatly reducing the phenomenon of members asking for leave and absenteeism, and increasing the time members spend on collective production. In the past, at least a dozen people from the team of one hundred and twenty-four households would ask for leave every day. Whenever it was market day, twenty or thirty people from the team would go to the market. Now, members' household affairs, except for particularly urgent ones, are generally handled on holidays. Before the implementation of the vacation system, member Wu Linkui's household affairs were unplanned, and he was absent from work for at least seven days a month. Now that household affairs are handled on holidays, he can work twenty-seven or eight days a month. Because everyone gets sufficient rest on holidays, they have more energy. After a day of rest, members constantly and spontaneously carry out "assault day" activities. Female member Wu Shuzhi and two others dug the ground, averaging one-third of an acre per person per day, an efficiency that is twice as high as in the past.

　　On this day of vacation, in addition to going to the market, visiting relatives, taking care of housework, and carrying out entertainment activities, members sometimes use the evening to hold forums to summarize the previous stage of work and allow everyone to offer suggestions. For example, when they began digging sweet potatoes, the efficiency of rolling the field and slicing them on the ground was very low. Through a forum held on a holiday, member Zhang Wenchao suggested rolling a strip of field in the middle of the field and slicing them on the spot, so that they could be cut as they were dug. In this way, the team of more than five hundred acres of sweet potatoes saved more than three hundred transport workers. The contradictions between collective labor and members' household labor were resolved, and the relationship between cadres and members was also improved.

　　After implementing the vacation and work system, the planning of work was also strengthened. The team adopted a phased (every half month) plan for production and a specific arrangement method. It was arranged in detail what work was to be completed in this half month, how many people were needed, and who would do it, and it was arranged to each person. To ensure the realization of the plan, members were also mobilized to make a half-month work plan, which increased the attendance rate.

### 有计划休息　有计划劳动  东升公社姜庄生产队实行放假作息制度

    有计划休息　有计划劳动
    东升公社姜庄生产队实行放假作息制度
    本报讯　河北东光县东升人民公社姜庄生产队实行了放假和作息制度。在紧张的劳动中，社员们在假日得到了充分的休息，人人心情舒畅，个个干劲倍增，生产效率大大提高，各项生产都比其他生产队先行一步。
    姜庄生产队从生产大跃进以来，全体社员的干劲十足。社员们为了完成各项生产任务，不分昼夜的进行鏖战突击。为了使社员的生产热情持续经常，党支部经过和群众商量，制订了放假和作息制度。规定平时保证社员每天睡眠八小时，吃饭、走路、娱乐四至六小时，劳动十至十二小时；每半月放假一天，公共食堂给大家改善伙食。这一制度从8月24日开始实行，三个月的实践证明，实行这一制度的好处很多。
    放假和休息制度的实行，使社员的家务劳动也走向计划化，大大减少了社员平时请假和旷工现象，增加了社员从事集体生产的时间。过去全队一百二十四户每天至少有十几人请假，每逢集日，全队就有二、三十个人去赶集。现在，社员的家务事除了特别紧急的以外，一般都等到假日办理。社员吴林奎在未实行放假时，家务事无计划，每月至少要缺七天勤，现在家务事等到假日办，每月能出勤二十七、八天。由于大家在假日得到了充分的休息，精力更加旺盛。休息一天以后，社员不断自发的开展“突击日”活动。妇女社员吴守芝等三人掘地，平均每人一天掘三分，效率比过去提高了一倍。
    在放假这一天，社员们除了随便赶集、探亲、料理家务、开展娱乐活动以外，有时还利用晚上的时间召开座谈会，总结前段工作，让大家献计。如在开始刨山芋时，在地头轧场切片，效率很低。通过假日开座谈会，社员张文朝提出在地当中轧条场，就地切片，随刨随切办法。这样全队五百多亩的山芋就节省了三百多个运输工。解决了集体劳动与社员家务劳动的矛盾，同时也改善了干部和社员的关系。
    实行放假和作息制度以后，同时加强了工作的计划性。这队对生产采取了分段（每半月）计划，具体安排的办法。这半月要完成那些活，需要多少人，由那些人去都一一安排好，并且一直安排到每个人身上。为了保证实现计划，还发动社员人人作半月出工计划，这样出勤率就提高了。
