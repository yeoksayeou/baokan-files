    Almaty and Gina
    Yang Mo
    Recently, a precious item has appeared on my desk – a silver frame in which a pretty little girl is actively climbing on snow-covered branches, smiling and gazing at me – this is my new friend, little Gina from the Soviet Union. On October 14th, after the Asian-African Writers' Conference, some of our Chinese delegates visited Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, from Tashkent. As soon as I got off the plane, I noticed that among the Soviet comrades welcoming us, there was a little girl in a beige coat who was waving to us affectionately with her big black eyes. I immediately happily picked her up, and she also warmly embraced me. From then on, we became good friends. She is six-year-old Gina, the little daughter of Comrade Moslezov, Chairman of the Kazakhstan Writers' Association. She is as warm and hospitable as her father, treating guests from faraway China as her relatives. What I remember most is that on the day we finally left Almaty, she came early to see us off again. Seeing me from afar, she rushed towards me with her little hands outstretched. I couldn't help but hug her tightly. Although we didn't speak the same language, I could clearly see what she wanted to say in her eyes: "Auntie, I love you because I love China"... That day, she gave me this photo. Even after our plane had already taken off, I could still see her little hands from the glass window, sometimes placed on her lips, sometimes waving to us. Although she probably couldn't see, although the plane had already sped down the runway, my hands just couldn't come down. And my eyes became wet without realizing it. ...
    Now, it has been more than ten days since I left little Gina, and it is a long distance away. But as soon as I see this photo on my desk, my heart returns to Almaty, and I see the lively and enthusiastic little Gina again. In fact, my longing for little Gina is closely linked with Almaty. When I think of her, I also think of it. Because they are both young, beautiful, and full of vitality.
    This is truly a rare city. Tall poplar trees stand one after another, almost covering all the buildings in the city. But surrounding this emerald green sea of trees are continuous, towering mountain peaks. In the sunlight, the white snow on the peaks and the green trees in the city reflect each other, forming a wonderful scene! But even more wonderful are the people – the great Soviet people, the people of Almaty, and the miracles of construction led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The current Almaty looks magnificent and grand, with tall buildings everywhere. But who would have thought that in 1911, after a major earthquake, only one house remained in the entire city; in 1921, a fierce flash flood broke out, and huge rocks washed down from the mountains destroyed the entire city again. However, after only a short thirty years, a modern, magnificent, and beautiful city has stood tall in front of the people of the world with its youthful vigor! The magnificent and bright Navoi Opera House here can accommodate one or two thousand people; there are theaters and national conservatories specially built for children; here, tall factory chimneys stand around the city, but there are parks of all sizes for the working people to rest everywhere in the city. The reflections of benches, the swaying willow branches... What a comfortable and peaceful place!
    At the same time, I also want to tell the readers that the entire Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic is also full of thriving prosperity, just like Almaty. In 1913, the entire Kazakhstan had only five million hectares of cultivated land; in 1953, it had nine million hectares; and in recent years, after the CPSU led the people in a large-scale reclamation of wasteland, the cultivated area has suddenly increased to thirty million hectares. ... I cannot introduce Kazakhstan and Almaty any further, I can only say that once I came here, I more deeply realized the greatness of communism, the greatness of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the greatness of the Soviet people. I also deeply realized that human talent and wisdom can only emit infinite power and eternal brilliance once they are combined with communism.
    Seeing such a country and people, who can not feel deep love and yearning in their hearts? Thus, all the goodwill towards our great neighbor that I had accumulated in my heart was poured onto little Gina at once. And through little Gina, I also felt a deep, passionate, and even indescribable emotion – this is the close, sincere, and deeper than brotherhood profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. Although the language barrier sometimes makes it difficult for us to express this emotion, why must deep feelings be expressed through language? Just like me and little Gina, we have not had a single conversation, but I believe that even when she grows up, she will not forget me, a Chinese person, just as I will never forget her and Almaty.

    阿拉木图和吉娜
    杨沫
    最近，我的案头多了一件珍贵的物品——银色的镜框里，一个漂亮的小女孩正活泼地爬在雪枝上含着微笑向我凝视——这是我的新朋友苏联的小吉娜。10月14日，亚非作家会议结束后，我们一部分中国代表从塔什干来到哈萨克斯坦共和国的首府阿拉木图访问。刚一下飞机，我就发现在许多迎接我们的苏联同志里面，有一个穿着米色大衣的小女孩正睁着乌黑的大眼睛向我们亲切地招手。我立刻高兴地抱起她来，她也亲热地搂住了我。从此我们成了好朋友。她就是六岁的小吉娜、哈萨克斯坦作家协会主席莫斯列佐夫同志的小女儿。她和父亲一样的热情好客，把来自遥远的中国客人当成了她的亲人。使我最难忘的是：当我们最后离开阿拉木图的那天，她又早早地来送我们。远远地看见了我，她就张开两只小手向我扑来。我忍不住紧紧抱住了她。虽然我们的语言不通，但是我从她的眼睛里可以清楚地看出她要说的话：“婶婶，我爱你，因为我爱中国”……这天，她送给我这张照片。一直到我们的飞机已经起飞了，我从玻璃窗口还看见她那双小手一会儿放在唇上，一会儿向我们挥舞。虽然她可能看不见，虽然飞机已经冲向跑道，可是我的两只手却怎么也放不下来。而且眼睛不知不觉地潮湿了。……
    现在，离开小吉娜已经十几天了，而且万里遥遥。可是一看到案头的这张照片，我的心又回到了阿拉木图，又看见了那活泼热情的小吉娜。实在，我对小吉娜的怀念是和阿拉木图紧紧地连在一起的。想起她，也想到它。因为她们是同样的年轻、美丽、朝气勃勃。
    这真是一个稀有的城市。高大的白杨树一棵连着一棵，几乎把整个城市的建筑都掩盖起来。可是在这翠绿的林海四周，紧紧包围着全城的却是连绵不断的高峻的山峰。阳光下，山峰上白皑皑的积雪和市内的绿树遥相辉映，这，形成一个多么奇妙的景色啊！但是更奇妙的还是人——伟大的苏联人，阿拉木图人和苏联共产党领导建设的奇迹。现在的阿拉木图看起来雄伟、壮丽，到处是高大的建筑物。但是，谁能想到1911年这里在一次大地震后全市只剩下了一所房屋；1921年这里又爆发了凶猛的山洪，从山上冲下来的巨石又毁坏了整个的城市。然而只经过短短的三十多年，一座现代化的雄伟而又美丽的大城市已经以它年轻的雄姿屹立在全世界人民的面前！这儿富丽、宏亮的那瓦伊大剧院可容一两千人；这儿有专为儿童修建的剧院和国立音乐院；这儿，工厂高大的烟囱环立在市外，市内却随处都有供劳动人民休息的大小公园。长凳的倒影，摇曳的柳枝……这是多么舒适、安静的所在呵！
    同时，我还要告诉读者，整个哈萨克斯坦共和国也全和阿拉木图一样充满了欣欣向荣的繁盛景况。1913年全哈萨克斯坦只有五百万公顷的耕地；1953年有了九百万公顷；而在最近几年苏共领导人民大规模开垦荒地后，现在耕地面积已突增到三千万公顷。……关于哈萨克斯坦和阿拉木图我不能再多介绍下去了，我只能说，一到这儿，我才更深刻地体会到共产主义的伟大，苏联共产党的伟大和苏联人民的伟大。也才深刻地体会到人类的才能、智慧，只有一旦和共产主义相结合后，它才能发出无穷无尽的力量与永不衰褪的灿烂的光芒。
    看到这样的国家和人民，人们的心里谁能不生出深深的爱慕与向往？于是，在我内心里所蕴蓄的这一切对我们伟大邻邦的好感，就一下子全倾注在小吉娜的身上。而且通过小吉娜，我还感受了一种深沉、热烈、甚至无法形容的情感——这就是中苏两国人民之间那种亲密、真挚、比亲兄弟还亲切的深情厚谊。虽然因为语言的隔阂，使我们有时难于表达这种情感，但是深的情谊何必一定要借语言来表达？就像我和小吉娜，我们并没有交谈过一句话，但是我相信，一直到她长大成人她都不会忘掉我这个中国人，正如同我永远也不会忘掉她和阿拉木图是一样。
