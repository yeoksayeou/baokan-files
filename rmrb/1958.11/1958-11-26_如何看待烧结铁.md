How to View Sintered Iron
Wu Lü

During the mass iron smelting campaign, some sintered iron was produced. As a result, some people became alarmed: it's terrible, the mass iron smelting campaign has produced sintered iron! In their view, sintered iron is worthless, and the mass iron and steel campaign is a losing proposition.

Is sintered iron good or not? We say: both good and bad. Sintered iron is not yet iron, hence the "bad"; but sintered iron has already been sintered once, and is an intermediate product between ore and iron. Re-smelting it makes it easier to produce good iron, hence the "good." Didn't Guangxi use sintered iron to re-smelt a lot of good iron? Didn't Henan already directly use sintered iron to make steel? To demean the both good and bad sintered iron to the point of being "worthless" is not being realistic.

Of course, we do not advocate producing sintered iron; no one smelting iron wants to produce sintered iron, but when technical equipment is insufficient, it is understandable that some sintered iron is produced. Saying that sintered iron is worthless, and then using sintered iron to negate the mass iron and steel campaign, actually reflects that some comrades are still standing outside the mass movement, adopting a "attack one point, disregard the rest" attitude towards individual shortcomings in the mass movement, placing individual shortcomings above the mainstream. In our view: first, the mass iron and steel campaign's achievements are the main aspect, although some sintered iron was produced, it is only a shortcoming of one finger out of nine; second, sixty million people initially came to the iron and steel front, most of whom were farmers who had just put down their hoes. In the beginning, they lacked experience, and it was inevitable that some sintered iron would be produced; third, moreover, sintered iron can be re-smelted, and even directly used to make steel, so we should actively help the masses to process and use the sintered iron.

Recognize the mainstream, regard sintered iron as an inevitable product of the mass movement, and enthusiastically help the masses re-smelt the sintered iron into good iron that meets quality standards. And strive to produce no sintered iron or less sintered iron in the future, so that the mass iron and steel campaign can continue to develop vigorously. If we can't see the mainstream, don't make a concrete analysis of the shortcomings, and don't proceed from a positive attitude, but condemn sintered iron outright, and negate the entire mass iron and steel campaign, not only will the sintered iron remain sintered iron and be difficult to put to any use, but the mass iron and steel campaign will inevitably suffer setbacks.

How to treat sintered iron is a touchstone to distinguish between promoters and "watchers" on the iron and steel front. It seems that the "watchers" are always trying to rise again, and the struggle against the "watchers" cannot be relaxed for a moment.

    如何看待烧结铁
    吴滤
    在全民炼铁运动中出了一些烧结铁。于是，有些人就大惊小怪起来：不好了，全民炼铁炼出烧结铁来，简直糟透了！在他们看来，烧结铁是一文不值的，全民炼钢铁的群众运动也是得不偿失的。
    烧结铁究竟好不好呢？我们说：又好又不好。烧结铁还不是铁，故曰不好；但烧结铁毕竟已经过一次烧结，是一种介于矿、铁之间的中间产品，再加回炼，就比较容易炼出好铁来，故又曰好。广西不是利用烧结铁回炼出许多好铁来吗？河南不是已经直接用烧结铁炼钢了吗？把又好又不好的烧结铁贬低到“一文不值”的程度，并不是实事求是的。
    当然，我们并不提倡出烧结铁；炼铁的人谁也不愿意出烧结铁，但是技术设备都不够的情况下，出了一些烧结铁也是可以谅解的。把烧结铁说得一文不值，并进而用烧结铁来否定全民炼钢铁的群众运动，实际上反映了有些同志还站在群众运动之外，对群众运动中的个别缺点采取了“攻其一点，不及其余”的态度，把个别缺点放在主流之上了。在我们看来：第一，全民炼钢铁的群众运动，成绩是主要的，虽然出了一些烧结铁，只是九个指头中一个指头的缺点；第二，六千万人初到钢铁战线，其中大部分是刚刚放下锄头的农民，开始的时候缺乏经验，出些烧结铁也是难免的；第三，况且烧结铁还可以回炉再炼，甚至可以直接炼钢，更应该积极帮助群众处理和使用烧结铁。
    认清主流，把烧结铁看成是群众运动中难免的产物，满腔热情地帮助群众把烧结铁回炉重炼，炼成合乎质量标准的好铁。并且力争今后不出烧结铁、少出烧结铁，就能使全民炼钢铁的群众运动继续蓬勃发展。看不见主流，不对缺点做具体分析，不从积极的态度出发，把烧结铁一口骂倒，把全民炼钢铁的群众运动全部否定，不仅烧结铁还是烧结铁，很难有什么用处，全民炼钢铁的群众运动也势必受到挫折。
    怎样对待烧结铁，是当前区别钢铁战线上促进派和“观潮派”的一颗试金石。看来，“观潮派”总是想伺机再起的，同“观潮派”的斗争一刻也不能松弛。
