Xinhua News Agency, London, November 25th: The Chilean newspaper "El Siglo" published on the 19th the speech of Luis Corvalán, General Secretary of the Chilean Communist Party, at the Eleventh Congress of the Chilean Communist Party held on the 18th.
    Analyzing the international political situation, Corvalán pointed out that the world has undergone fundamental changes. Socialism, once represented only by the Soviet Union, has become a world system due to the emergence of the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries in Europe and Asia. He said that the Soviet Union will soon surpass the United States in many aspects of production, and the construction achievements of the People's Republic of China in nine years are equivalent to hundreds of years of construction achievements. The People's Republic of China has become a great industrial country in the world.
    Corvalán then pointed out that the situation in Latin America is also changing. Several dictatorships have collapsed and been replaced by constitutional governments. Communist parties have gained legal status in Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina, and Chile. The party in Brazil is already working openly. The Communist Party of Honduras has also been formally established in recent years. Corvalán quoted Mao Zedong as saying: "It is not the West wind prevailing over the East wind, but the East wind prevailing over the West wind."
    Corvalán said that the exciting progress made by socialism and the victorious struggles of the people of Asia and Africa have inspired the people of Latin American countries. More and more Latin Americans are currently opposing the war policies of the American monopolists who exploit them. The examples of American provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait and against the people of Lebanon and Jordan have taught us to be vigilant, develop national and international solidarity, and fight for peace.
    The Chilean Communist Party received congratulatory messages from communist parties around the world on the occasion of its Eleventh National Congress.
    "El Siglo" published in full on the 19th the congratulatory messages from Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, and the communist parties of Korea, the Soviet Union, France, Romania, and many other countries.

    智共总书记在党代表大会上指出
    东风鼓舞着拉丁美洲人民
    反对美国战争政策的人愈来愈多
    新华社伦敦25日电　智利“世纪报”19日刊载了智利共产党总书记路易斯·科尔巴兰在智利共产党18日召开的第十一次代表大会上的讲话。
    在分析国际的政治局势时，科尔巴兰指出：世界已经发生了根本的变化。一度只是以苏联为代表的社会主义，已经由于中华人民共和国以及欧洲和亚洲其它社会主义国家的出现而成为一个世界体系。他说，苏联不久将在生产的许多方面超过美国，而中华人民共和国在九年中的建设成就等于好几百年的建设成就。中华人民共和国已经成为世界上伟大的工业国家。
    科尔巴兰接着指出，在拉丁美洲，局势也在发生变化。若干独裁政权垮台了，取而代之的是立宪政府。共产党在委内瑞拉、玻利维亚、哥伦比亚、阿根廷和智利已经取得合法地位。巴西的党已经公开进行工作。洪都拉斯共产党也在最近几年正式成立了。科尔巴兰引用毛泽东的话说：“现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。”
    科尔巴兰说，社会主义所取得的令人兴奋的进展和亚非人民胜利的斗争，鼓舞了拉丁美洲各国人民。目前愈来愈多的拉丁美洲人在反对剥削他们的美国垄断资本家的战争政策。美国在台湾海峡对中国人民所进行的挑衅以及对黎巴嫩和约旦人民的挑衅的事例教育了我们必须保持警惕，发展民族的和国际团结，以及为争取和平而斗争。
    智利共产党在召开第十一次全国代表大会之际接到了世界各国共产党的贺电。
    “世纪报”在19日全文刊载了毛泽东、胡志明和朝鲜、苏联、法国、罗马尼亚以及许多其它国家的共产党的贺电。
