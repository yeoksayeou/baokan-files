Attacking the Big with the Masses
——On the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant's Trial Production of Large-Scale Indigenous Machine Tools
By Our Shanghai Correspondent

With the workers' soaring ambition, Mount Tai is like bread;
Ants gnawing on bones, a flower tray is a cake.
These are verses written by the workers of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant when they were manufacturing large-scale indigenous machine tools.

At the beginning of June this year, the Party Committee of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant presented the equipment section with a challenge: the plant was to produce large-scale electric motors and generators, which had never been produced domestically before. However, ordering machinery and equipment was extremely difficult, especially large vertical lathes, boring machines, and gantry planers. Ordering from abroad might take a year and a half. Therefore, the Party Committee called on everyone to promote the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, to be self-reliant, and to manufacture large-scale indigenous equipment and indigenous machine tools themselves.

The workers started working on their own. Technicians Bi Rulin and Xu Derong, who came from worker backgrounds, each led a group of electricians, lathe operators, and fitters to be responsible for trial-producing a large gantry planer and a large vertical lathe. They collectively designed and collectively created. Some drawings couldn't be produced, so the workers started working based on oral instructions. There were indeed many difficulties. A behemoth like the five-meter vertical lathe, not to mention having never made one, very few people had even seen one. During the design and manufacture, the workers still consulted engineers, but the engineers coldly said, "You're the ones who want to launch satellites!" The attitude of foreign experts did not discourage the workers. They were determined to overcome difficulties with their own wisdom and perseverance. If there were no materials, they would look for them in the scrap pile. If there were no lathes for processing, they would sneak into other workshops.

However, the biggest technical difficulty arrived. The welders had finally flattened the steel plates and welded the table surface of the large gantry planer, but the ends of the table surface suddenly warped upwards like small boats. "It's over!" The welder walked into the office of the branch secretary Ying Lianfang with a heavy expression. Ying Lianfang was also taken aback. The "insurmountable difficulty" that the engineer had mentioned had indeed appeared. He thought: using welded steel plates instead of castings for the slide plate was the key to this indigenous gantry planer, and they must not succumb to difficulties. He stood up and said to the workers: Let's think of a solution together and see if we can correct it. So everyone studied the warped table surface. Fortunately, the bottom and sides of the slide plate had not yet been welded. Someone suggested that since welding causes warping, if we weld the bottom plate in the opposite direction, it will warp in the opposite direction, couldn't we flatten the table surface? Everyone said it was a good idea and immediately started welding. Sure enough, the table surface was flattened, and the difficulty was finally overcome in practice.

The five-meter vertical lathe that Technician Xu Derong was responsible for also encountered a key problem. Originally, the turntable of the vertical lathe was made of castings, but it weighed dozens of tons, and there was no place to cast it. They tried to weld a shell out of scrap steel plates and angle steel and then pour cement into it. But after finally welding it, it was impossible to process. This large turntable was fifteen feet in diameter, like a small stage, and it blocked the passage in the workshop. Not to mention that there was no lathe in all of Shanghai that could process this large turntable, even its base was intractable. Difficulties did not scare them, and everyone still came up with ideas collectively. Finally, a solution was found. They used two I-beams to frame the workshop pillars, installed a shaft in the middle, and placed the turntable base on the shaft. Driven by a motor, the large turntable base rotated between the pillars like a windmill. People climbed onto the I-beam frame and could operate the lathe.

Victory excited everyone. Everyone thought they should write a poem to express their feelings. Someone said: "Mount Tai is the largest in the world, we are not afraid even with Mount Tai in front of us, let's write 'Mount Tai is like bread'." Some said: "Although the big turntable is big, it can only be a cake compared to Mount Tai." Thus, the magnificent poem "With the workers' soaring ambition, Mount Tai is like bread; ants gnawing on bones, a flower tray is a cake" was collectively created.

On October 8, the first six-foot wide and eighteen-foot long indigenous gantry planer was finally completed and test-run. This large machine tool used welded steel plates for the slide plate and cement for the machine frame, saving fifty tons of steel raw materials, and cost only 35,000 yuan in total. Buying a new domestic product would cost 160,000 yuan. The test-run ceremony was filled with gongs and drums, and guests thronged the door. The Party Secretary, the Factory Director, and the Chief Engineer all came. Pens, ink, paper, and inkstones were moved to the workshop for a grand poetry meeting. Electrician Ren Genfu was the first to write the four characters "开车大吉" [kāi chē dà jí - Auspicious Start for the Machine] in large letters, and then wrote a poem of praise:

"Indigenous produces foreign, foreign produces indigenous, indigenous and foreign flowers bloom everywhere;
Machine produces egg, egg produces machine, machines will number ten thousand in the future."

Then everyone took turns writing, creating a hundred and ten poems. At this time, Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, came to the factory to inspect. Hearing about this grand event, he also rushed to the workshop to congratulate them. The workers' emotions were even higher. Someone proposed that Comrade Liu Ningyi also write a poem. Comrade Liu Ningyi was moved by the workers' victorious enthusiasm and immediately wrote a poem on the spot praising "Celebrating the Success of the Gantry Planer". The poem said:

"The east wind blows a hundred flowers red, Shanghai Electric produces heroes,
Cadres and workers work together, indigenous and foreign combined are a great success;
Hard work for less than two months, truly more, faster, better, and more economical,
To surpass the 1070, looking at satellites in the ninth heaven."

    以群攻大
    ——记上海电机厂试制大型土机床
    本报驻上海记者
    工人志气高，泰山当面包；
    蚂蚁啃骨头，花盘当蛋糕。
    这是上海电机厂工人在自己制造大型土机床时所写的诗句。
  今年6月初，上海电机厂党委向设备科摊了一张牌：厂内要生产国内从来没有生产过的大型电动机和发电机，但机器设备订购十分困难，尤其是大型的立式车床、搪床和龙门刨床等，向国外订货，一年半载怕不能定到。因此，党委号召大家发扬敢想敢说敢做的精神，自力更生，自己制造大型的土设备、土机床。
    工人们自己动手干起来了。工人出身的技师毕如林和徐德荣各自率领了一批电工、车工、钳工，分头负责试制一台大龙门刨和一台大立车。他们集体设计、集体创造，有些图纸画不出，工人们根据口头传授就干起活来。困难的确不少，像五公尺大立车这样的庞然大物，别说没有做过，也很少有人见过。在设计制造中，工人们还是去请教工程师，可是工程师冷冷地说：“卫星是你们要放的呀”！洋专家的态度并没有使工人们泄气，他们决心用自己的智慧和毅力来克服困难。没有材料，就到废料堆里去找，没有车床加工，就钻别的车间的空子。
    但是，技术上的最大困难，果然来了。电焊工好容易压平了钢板，焊接好大龙门刨的台面，台面两头忽然像小船一样翘起来了。“完了！”电焊工带着沉痛的表情走进支部书记应连芳的办公室来。应连芳心里也一怔，工程师曾提出过的“不可克服的困难”果然出现了。他想：用焊接钢板代替铸件做拖板，是这台土龙门刨的关键，决不能向困难低头。他站起来对工人们说：我们一道去想办法，看看是否能校正过来。于是大伙就在弯曲得不像样的台面旁边研究起来。幸亏拖板底和边都还没有焊，有人提出，电焊既然要弯，如果我们在焊底板时从反方向焊，就会从反方向翘，岂不可以把台面拉平了吗？大家都说这主意不错，立刻动手焊起来。果然台面校平了，困难终于在实践中克服了。
    徐德荣技师负责的五公尺立车也遇到了关键性的问题。原来立车的花盘是铸件做的，但有几十吨重，没有地方浇铸，他们想法用废钢板和角钢焊成个壳子，再用水泥浇。但好容易焊好了，却无法加工。这大花盘直径有一丈五尺，像个小型舞台一样，把车间都塞得不好走路。别说这个大花盘全上海没有一台车床能加工，就是它的底座也奈何不得。困难没有把他们吓倒，大家还是集体出主意。最后，办法终于想出来了。他们用两根工字铁架在车间柱子上，中间装一根轴，把花盘底座架在轴上，用马达带，大花盘底座就像风车一样在柱子间转起来。人爬在工字铁架上，正好可以掌刀。
    胜利激动着每一个人，大家想到该写一首诗来表达一下自己的心境。有人说：“天下泰山最大，泰山当前我们也不怕，就写泰山当面包吧。”有的说：“大花盘虽大，比泰山只能当蛋糕”。于是“工人志气高，泰山当面包；蚂蚁啃骨头，花盘当蛋糕”这首气势磅礴的诗就集体创作出来了。
    10月8日，第一台六尺宽、一丈八尺长的土龙门刨床终于完工试车了。这台大机床用焊接钢板和拖板，用水泥制机架，省下钢铁原材料五十吨，总共只花了三万五千元，买一台新的国产品可得十六万元。试车典礼上锣鼓喧天，宾客盈门，党委书记、厂长、总工程师都来了。笔墨纸砚搬到车间，大做诗会。电工任根福首先动笔写了“开车大吉”四个大字，接着又写了一首赞美诗：
    “土生洋，洋生土，土洋花朵处处开；
    机生蛋，蛋生机，来日机器万万千。”
    接着大家轮流执笔，写了洋洋百十来首诗。这时正好中华全国总工会主席刘宁一同志来工厂视察，听说这个盛会，也赶到车间祝贺。工人们情绪更高了。不知那一个提议，请刘宁一同志也写一首诗。刘宁一同志被工人群众的胜利热情所激动，当场提笔口赞“庆龙门刨成功”一首。诗曰：
    东风吹得百花红，上海电机出英雄，
    干部工人齐动手，土洋结合大成功；
    苦战不到两个月，真是多快又好省，
    一○七○要超过，九霄云上看卫星。
