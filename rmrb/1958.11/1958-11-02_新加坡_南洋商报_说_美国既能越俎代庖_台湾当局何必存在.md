    Singapore's "Nanyang Siang Pau" Says
    If the U.S. Can Usurp Authority,
    What Need is There for the Taiwan Authorities to Exist?
    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 1st: Singapore's "Nanyang Siang Pau" recently published an editorial entitled "Dulles' Great Achievement—Taipei Announces Abandonment of the Use of Force," saying that Dulles's visit to Taiwan was aimed "at putting pressure on General Chiang Kai-shek to make Chiang agree to reduce or withdraw the defense forces of Jinmen and Matsu." The editorial believes that the reason Dulles dares to disregard Chiang's opposition and insist that Chiang implement the U.S. plan is because "what Taipei relies on is U.S. aid."
    This overseas Chinese newspaper also accused U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson's remarks to reporters in Taipei of "usurping authority," which is equivalent to announcing to the world on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek that he not only has no plan to "counterattack the mainland," but also has no ambition to "counterattack the mainland." This is clearly intended to make it impossible for the Taiwan authorities to survive, making people think, "What reason is there for General Chiang Kai-shek's regime to exist?".

### 新加坡“南洋商报”说  美国既能越俎代庖  台湾当局何必存在

    新加坡“南洋商报”说
    美国既能越俎代庖
    台湾当局何必存在
    新华社香港1日电　新加坡“南洋商报”最近发表题为“杜勒斯大功告成——台北宣告放弃使用武力”的社论说，杜勒斯访问台湾的目的“是在对蒋介石将军施以压力，使蒋氏同意减少或撤退金马的防军”。社论认为，杜勒斯之所以敢于不顾蒋的反对，硬要蒋执行美国的计划，是因为“台北所依赖的，是美国的援助”。
    这家华侨报纸还指责美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在台北向记者发表的谈话是“越俎代庖”，等于替蒋介石向天下宣布，他不但没有“反攻大陆”的计划，也并没有“反攻大陆”的志向。这显然存心使台湾当局混不下去，使人们想到“蒋介石将军的政权还有什么存在的理由呢？”。
