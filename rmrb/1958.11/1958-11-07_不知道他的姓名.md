    Not Knowing His Name
    Wei Ping
    One sultry afternoon this summer, I took my three-year-old sister for a walk in the park. The beauty of the motherland's landscape is especially touching to me—a returned overseas Chinese... Suddenly, thunder roared, and the clear sky turned into a dark haze, with heavy rain pouring down on the visitors. I had to hurry my sister toward the park exit, wanting to get home quickly. The rain was heavy and the road slippery, and I accidentally tripped and fell. My sister fell underneath me, crying as if her life depended on it. At that moment, a Soviet comrade came from ahead, around forty years old. Although he was wearing a raincoat, he was running as fast as the other visitors trying to avoid the rain, as if he had something urgent to attend to. When he reached us, he stopped. He immediately bent down and used his hand to support my sister’s head, with a kind and benevolent smile on his face, signaling her not to cry. But my sister wouldn’t listen and cried even harder, kicking her little feet on the ground.
    The rain poured down like a waterfall. The Soviet comrade's pair of clear blue eyes stared straight at my sister's right arm, and he suddenly said in fluent Chinese with surprise, "What? Is her arm broken?" I looked and realized that my sister’s right arm was bent from the fall. There happened to be a pedicab across the street, and the Soviet comrade immediately called it over. The three of us went to the hospital together.
    At the hospital, the Soviet comrade gently held my sister in his arms like a kind father and walked towards the surgery room. By the time my sister was bandaged, it was already past six o'clock in the evening. The Soviet comrade then took us out for dinner and bought my sister cookies and apples before leaving.
    When my mother arrived at the hospital, my sister had already stopped crying. My mother took out some money and said to the doctor, "Comrade, how much do I owe?" The doctor shook his head and said, "You don't need to pay. That Soviet comrade already paid everything." My mother couldn't help but exclaim "Ah!" and her hand trembled slightly. At that moment, six or seven people, including the doctor and nurses, gathered together, looking at each other, too moved to speak.
      "Do you know where he works and what his name is?" my mother asked anxiously. "I didn't ask him, and he didn't tell me," I replied, which made everyone feel regretful.
    On the way home, my mother walked very slowly, with tears of emotion constantly flashing in her deep-set eyes. My sister nestled in my mother's arms and fell asleep.

    不知道他的姓名
    蔚苹
    今年夏天的一个闷热的下午，我领着三岁的妹妹到公园里去散步。祖国江山如此多娇，对于我——一个刚从国外归来的华侨来说，体会得特别亲切……。突然，雷声大作，万里晴空变成了一片阴霾，大雨倾盆似地泼洒在游人身上。我只好抱着妹妹急急忙忙地向公园出口处跑，想快些回家去。雨大路滑，一个不留心，扑通跌了一跤。妹妹摔在下面，哭得死去活来。这时，从我们前面来了一位苏联同志，约摸四十岁上下。他虽然穿着一件雨衣，可是也像避雨的游人一样跑得很急，好像有什么急事。当他走到我们身旁后就停住了。马上弯下腰来用手托住我妹妹的脑袋，脸上露出亲切而仁慈的微笑，示意着叫妹妹不要哭了。但是妹妹不听话，愈哭愈厉害，两只小脚在地上乱跳。
    雨像瓢泼似地直往下泻。这位苏联同志的一对碧澄澄的眼睛直楞楞地望着妹妹的右臂，突然吃惊地用熟练的中国话说：“怎么？手臂断啦？”我一看，原来妹妹的右臂跌弯了。马路对面恰好有三轮车，这位苏联同志马上把他叫了过来。我们三个人一起来到了医院。
    到了医院，苏联同志像个慈祥的父亲一样把妹妹轻轻地抱在怀里，向外科室走去。当妹妹包扎好时，已是晚上六点多钟了，这位苏联同志又领我们出去吃晚饭，还给妹妹买了饼干和苹果，然后才离去。
    妈妈来到医院时，妹妹早已不哭了。妈妈拿着钱，对医师说：“同志，要多少钱？”医师摇摇手说：“不用付了，刚才那位苏联同志都给付清了。”妈妈情不自禁地“啊”了一声，手微微地颤动着。这时，医师、护士等六七个人围在一起，大家你望望我，我望望你，激动得谁也没有说话。
      “知道他在什么地方工作，叫什么名字吗？”妈妈着急地问。“没有问他，他也没有告诉我。”我的回答，使大家都感到很遗憾。
    回家的路上，妈妈走得很慢，在她那对深陷的眼窝里，不断地闪着激动的泪花。妹妹依偎在妈妈的怀里睡着了。
