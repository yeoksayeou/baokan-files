    Everyone Come Cut the "Appendix"
    The Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant's proposal to boldly cut the "appendix," simplify machine tool parts, and save steel is a very meaningful thing.

    Saving steel is a major gain from cutting the "appendix." However, the gains in people's thinking are far more significant than saving steel. What is dispensable, eliminate it; what can be big or small, make it small; what can be heavy or light, make it light; what can be long or short, make it short; this is a guiding ideology. Conversely, if everywhere we increase the safety factor, preferring big to small, preferring heavy to light, preferring long to short, this is another guiding ideology. The matter of cutting the "appendix" puts the leadership and the masses of enterprises to the test of two ideologies, guiding them onto a healthy path.

    The physical appendix is only one, but the "appendix" in our work, unlike the human appendix, exists in many places. Everyone taking action to cut off the "appendix" is a good thing, it is a revolution.

### 大家都来割“盲肠”

    大家都来割“盲肠”
    沈阳第一机床厂提出大刀阔斧割“盲肠”，简化机床部件，节省钢材，是一件很有意义的事情。
    节省钢材是割“盲肠”的一大收获。但是，人们思想上的收获，却远比节省钢材的意义要重大得多。可有可无的，无；可大可小的，小；可重可轻的，轻；可长可短的，短；这是一种指导思想。反之，如果处处加大保险系数，宁大勿小，宁重勿轻，宁长勿短，这又是一种指导思想。割“盲肠”这件事，就使企业的领导和群众在两种思想的考验中，走上健康的道路。
    身体上的盲肠只有一个，而工作中的“盲肠”，却同人体的盲肠不同，它有好多个。大家动手割掉“盲肠”，是一件好事，是一项革命。
