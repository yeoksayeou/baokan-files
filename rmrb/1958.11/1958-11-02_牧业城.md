Grassland business is booming

    "Pastoral City"
    Upon entering the Bayantsetseg Pastoral Commune in Sonid Right Banner, Inner Mongolia, one is greeted by five neat streets, composed of over eighty yurts. Amidst the cluster of yurts stand ten earth-and-wood structured houses. In the grassland north of the village, a group of Mongolian commune members are busy laying foundations for new houses.
    Since ancient times, such yurt villages had never appeared in the nomadic regions of Inner Mongolia. This year, with the merging of smaller pastoral cooperatives into larger communes, this commune, expanding from twenty-six households to one hundred and twenty-seven, gave birth to this new type of pastoral village. The commune members affectionately call it "Pastoral City."
      After the establishment of "Pastoral City," many new things have emerged on the grassland. There is a milk powder factory here, housed in a medium-sized yurt. Two middle-aged Mongolian women are producing whole milk powder in the factory. They used to herd sheep and milk cows, and only learned the milk powder production technique a month ago. In other yurts, there are small processing plants for hides and furs, wood, sewing, and cleaning. The commune members can now process their own woodware, leather, and clothing. After the news of the nationwide Great Leap Forward in steel production reached here, they rode horses up the mountains to mine iron ore for the country. During the mining process, they also discovered a copper mine, which they are now preparing to exploit and smelt.
      "Pastoral City" also boasts a veterinary station, a primary school, a nursery, a herdsmen's health clinic, a library, and an amateur song and dance group, all run by the pastoral commune. (Attached image)

### “牧业城”

    “牧业城”
    一走进内蒙古苏尼特旗巴音策力牧业社，迎面看到五条整齐的街道，这是由八十多座蒙古包组成的。在蒙古包群中间，矗立着十幢土木结构的房屋，村北的草地上，还有一群蒙古族社员，正在那里打地基盖新房。
    自古以来，在内蒙古游牧区里，还未出现过这样的蒙古包村落。今年，牧区牧业社并大社，这个社由二十六户扩大到一百二十七户，才诞生了这个新型的牧村。社员们亲切的称呼它为“牧业城”。
      “牧业城”建立后，草原上出现了许多新鲜事情。这里有个乳粉厂，厂房是座中型蒙古包。厂里有两个中年牧民妇女在生产全脂乳粉，她们过去一直在放羊挤奶，一个月前才学会生产乳粉技术。在其他一些蒙古包里，还有皮毛、木材、缝纫、拆洗等小型加工厂。社员们所用的木器、皮张、衣服等，都能自己加工生产了。全民大炼钢铁的消息传到这里以后，他们骑马上山，为国家开采铁矿石。在采矿过程中，还找到一个铜矿，现在正准备开采和冶炼。
      “牧业城”里，还有牧业社自办的兽医站、小学、托儿所、牧人保健所、图书馆和业余歌舞小组。（附图片）
