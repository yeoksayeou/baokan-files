Singing of Inner Mongolia
    Xing Xinyi

(I) The scenery beyond the Great Wall is beautiful
      It has a great reputation since ancient times
      People say Inner Mongolia
      Now has greatly changed
      Tall buildings rise from the ground
      The people are busy building

(II) The desert turns into an oasis
      Cattle and sheep are fat and strong
      Bayun Obo Iron Mine, Shiguai Coal
      Baogang chimneys are ten thousand feet high
      Large and small factories are dotted around
      Railways and highways are like spider webs

(III) Airplanes and ships shuttle back and forth
      Postal and telecommunications networks reach in all directions
      Agricultural and pastoral water conservancy is electrified
      Everywhere is a new atmosphere

(IV) Catch up with the Yangtze River from the Yellow River
      Agricultural production is just around the corner
      Mongolian and Han people are united
      Building a happy new borderland

    歌唱内蒙古
    邢心一（一）塞外风光好
      自古盛名扬
      人说内蒙古
      如今大变样
      高楼平地起
      人民建设忙（二）沙漠变绿洲
      牛羊肥又壮
      白云铁矿、石拐煤
      包钢烟囱高万丈
      大小厂矿星罗布
      铁路公路像蛛网（三）飞机轮船如穿梭
      四通八达邮电网
      农牧水利电气化
      到处一片新气象（四）过黄河赶长江
      农业生产指日上
      蒙汉人民大团结
      建设幸福新边疆
