Five Months in the Countryside Surpasses Ten Years of Study
    ——A Record of the Work-Study Program at Taiyuan Water Conservancy School
    By Our Correspondent Shui Tiansheng
    “Work-study is truly good, the harvest in half a year is extremely great, going to the site for practical learning, daring to think and daring to create, the harvest can be so great, all thanks to the Party's good leadership.” This is a poem praising the work-study program circulating among the teachers and students of Taiyuan Water Conservancy School.
    From February to the end of July this year, Taiyuan Water Conservancy School carried out a work-study program centered on river basin management planning. Teachers and students from the entire school traveled to eighty-four counties in Shanxi Province, formulating river basin management plans for thirty-six river systems including the Fen River and the Hutuo River. Through five months of practical labor, the school underwent major changes in its teaching work and the political thought of its teachers and students. Not long ago, at a celebration of the harvest held by all teachers and students, Principal Yang Lantian said in his report: The harvest of the work-study program is a great victory for the Party's educational policy and a complete defeat for bourgeois educational thought.
            A Great Debate
    In the past, teachers at Taiyuan Water Conservancy School generally held erroneous views of slighting politics and slighting practice. When lecturing on soil and water conservation and water conservancy projects, they only talked about large-scale projects, but not the small and medium-sized projects needed in rural areas; they quoted a large amount of foreign materials, principles and formulas from books, making students memorize them by rote, without combining them with actual needs. Although students study reservoirs, they do not know what a reservoir actually looks like; some students majoring in water conservancy engineering do not even know extremely common knowledge such as steep slopes and waterfalls. Because teaching was divorced from politics, students lacked the viewpoint of serving socialism, and their professional ideology was very unstable.
    Faced with serious problems, teachers and students of Taiyuan Water Conservancy School, under the leadership of the Party, launched a teaching revolution. All teachers and students launched a debate aimed at various arguments such as "work-study undermines educational traditions, schools are only places to spread advanced theories, and going to the countryside to work will inevitably reduce teaching quality." Through debate, most people realized that bourgeois education can only cultivate intellectuals of the exploiting class who are ignorant of the five grains and do not engage in physical labor. Only by implementing the policy of combining education with labor can we cultivate intellectuals who are both red and expert. At this point, erroneous ideas were severely criticized, and confused ideas were also clarified. The school leaders formulated plans and measures for work-study, and decided that all teachers and students should go to the countryside to participate in practical work, carrying out work-study activities centered on river basin management planning. More than 800 students and more than 50 teachers from the entire school, holding high the banner of the teaching revolution, stepped out of the classroom amidst the upsurge of rural water conservancy construction, and began their first lesson in combining education with labor in the Fen River, Zhang River and other thirty-six river systems along the Jinan and Jinzhong plains, the Saiwai Yanbei region and the Taihang Mountains.
  Practice—The Source of Knowledge
    Learning in practice, how rich is knowledge! The teachers and students of Taiyuan Water Conservancy School who walked out of the classroom were all in high spirits. In nature and in the actual struggle, teachers and students observed and studied in depth, studied mountains, rivers, vegetation, and human geography. While working with their hands, their knowledge domain expanded, and they also learned a lot of useful knowledge. Students who went to Baicheng River in Yanggao County to make plans for flood investigation found that the flood investigation according to the textbook was inaccurate after several investigations. Through labor practice, teachers and students realized that flood investigation should fully consider natural factors, and it is impossible to simply apply formulas without combining them with actual conditions. Zhang Chunlan, a student who went to Wenyu River in Wenshui County to make a plan, was drawing a cumulative area map of Wenyu River basin for the first time, but practice solved the lack of knowledge. She repeatedly investigated and thought on the spot, and personally collected data, and finally drew a qualified chart. She said: Labor practice is the key to increasing practical knowledge and enriching theoretical knowledge. Only by combining teaching with productive labor can we learn real knowledge. Fan Xiqing, a second-year student majoring in farmland water conservancy engineering, boldly compiled a textbook of 40,000 words for training rural water conservancy technicians while learning and doing planning work. The content of this textbook is practical and easy to understand, and is welcomed by farmers. He said: The successful compilation of this textbook is the result of the collision of theory and practice. If he sat in the classroom, he would never be able to compile this textbook in his life. Through labor practice, the vast majority of students went from not knowing how to do it at all, to being able to make comprehensive plans for water conservancy, soil and water conservation, agriculture, and forestry; many students can undertake a series of tasks from selecting reservoirs, designing storage capacity, construction, and writing planning reports. In the past, most people did not know how to survey and draw topographic maps, but now they have learned how to do it.
    Learn from the working people! This is a resounding slogan put forward by Taiyuan Water Conservancy School after contacting the working people. Whenever they go to a place, they ask labor models, local experts, and old farmers to introduce their experiences and knowledge, and learn on the spot. When forty-one teachers and students from three majors including farmland water conservancy were planning the Huishui River basin in Jinan, they tried to solve many difficult problems with only some book knowledge, but they could not solve them all. Later, when they learned from the masses and relied on the wisdom and strength of the masses to carry out the planning, the problems were much easier to solve. Once they felt difficulties in making comprehensive use of land, but after the branch secretary and director of the Ganqing Township Agricultural Cooperative in Wenxi County gave them a rich lesson on soil and water conservation, the teachers and students suddenly became enlightened and determined the key issues such as developing agriculture as the main focus, forestry and animal husbandry as the auxiliary, reducing farmland, and making full use of land in the Huishui River basin. Teacher Liu Chengshu said: This time, he learned many technical experiences created by the working people, such as planting trees on rocky mountains, underground springs for both drought and flood, Zhuan Shan Canal and comprehensive utilization of land technical measures, which intellectuals sitting in schools could not even imagine. Through practice, she clarified that intellectuals must learn from the working people, and teaching must serve production.
    In the actual struggle and labor exercise, the thinking of teachers and students in this school has undergone tremendous changes. When teachers and students went to the countryside and saw men, women, old and young building water conservancy and carrying out production under the lights, and when they saw the hard-working, simple and brave style of the working people, they were moved to tears and deeply felt their own shame of being "ignorant of the five grains and not engaging in physical labor". Students who originally disliked farmers for being dirty no longer disliked them, people who said they did not have the strength to carry luggage disappeared, and they put down the airs of intellectuals and ate, lived, and worked with the farmers. Wang Amin, a second-year student majoring in water conservancy, often hired donkeys to travel when he first went to the countryside, but inspired by the hard-working spirit of the working people fighting against nature, he not only stopped hiring donkeys but also personally made a willow pole to carry luggage for weak classmates. He wrote on the pole: "The pole is soft and soft, carrying luggage rolls, traveling thousands of miles a day, not bitter but sweet." In order to complete the task as soon as possible, teachers and students worked day and night, and did not bow their heads to difficulties. Six students who went to Lingshi County to plan the Longfeng River climbed the "Ghost Gate Pass" full of thorns and cliffs for surveying. Although the work was arduous, they thought that if the planning of this river was good and all the construction was completed, it could irrigate 400,000 mu of land and benefit the people of Lingshi and Jiexiu counties, they mustered up the courage and completed the longitudinal and transverse measurement of the river and the topographic measurement of the reservoir in eleven days. Whenever the teachers and students who went to Jiaocheng to plan the Wenyu River sang the famous Shanxi folk song: "Jiaocheng Mountain, Jiaocheng Water, irrigates Jiaocheng but not Wenshui", they decided to change the content of this folk song with reality. After making a river basin plan for the Wenyu River that irrigates both Jiaocheng and Wenshui, they happily sang a new song "Jiaocheng Mountain, Jiaocheng Water, irrigates Jiaocheng and irrigates Wenshui" with the masses. In labor practice, many students have a new understanding of water conservancy and love their major. Teachers and students of Taiyuan Water Conservancy School formulated river basin management plans for thirty-six river systems including the Fen River in five months. The plan includes small and medium-sized reservoirs, small hydropower stations, canals, gullies, mountain closure for afforestation, land ridges, dry wells, and storage ponds. After all these projects are implemented, they can control soil erosion of more than 50 million mu and develop an irrigation area of 35 million mu. This indisputable fact silenced the opponents and doubters of work-study, and the teachers who had been deeply immersed in books also realized it.
      Labor Production Report
    After the teachers and students of Taiyuan Water Conservancy School returned to the countryside, the school leaders adopted a completely different examination method from the past: let each student write a "labor production report." This is another bold reform in teaching.
    In the past, whenever the exam came, students were uneasy, burning the midnight oil to memorize dogmas, swallowing dates whole, fearing that they would not be familiar with it and fail the exam. But this time the atmosphere was completely different. Before the exam, the students put aside their textbooks and quietly read the knowledge and materials about water conservancy and soil and water conservation that they had learned and collected from production practice, focusing on thinking about problems, or engaging in heated discussions with classmates, and then began to write "labor production reports" based on their own experiences, handing in test papers marking a significant improvement in political thought and teaching quality to the Party.
    The production labor report is a true identification of the political thought and professional knowledge of students. It proves with the most eloquent facts that the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor is the only way to cultivate talents who are both red and expert. Opening each "labor production report", each student wrote down their gains in moral, intellectual, physical and other aspects in production labor, combined with their own ideological reality and experience. In the "labor production report", each student also made a plan and engineering design for a river, canal, reservoir, hydropower station, bridge, and dry well. These plans and engineering designs not only summarize the experience of the working people, but also have scientific principles and technical explanations, and can be taken to the site for construction. Zhang Guantai, a second-year student majoring in water conservancy engineering construction, failed four courses in the last final exam, but this time he wrote an excellent "labor production report." He made a comprehensive plan for Quanshui River in Yushshe County based on the investigation materials of natural conditions and social and economic conditions, and proposed scientific designs for reservoirs, canals, etc. that meet the needs of farmers. Why did this student, who failed four courses half a year ago, make such rapid progress? Zhang Guantai said it well: In practice, practical knowledge provides him with a wealth of theoretical basis; at the same time, because theory is linked to practice, he can understand and consolidate the knowledge he has learned. Li Huaijie, a second-year student majoring in farmland water conservancy, used to memorize lecture notes and notes by rote in order to pass the exam, which caused neurasthenia and lost interest in learning. He had repeatedly asked to drop out of school. But through this labor practice, everything has changed. He wrote in the "labor production report": "In the past, teaching was divorced from reality, and I only knew how to study hard. This time, I participated in productive labor and learned real knowledge. I no longer memorize dogmas, and my body is stronger. This is entirely the benefit of work-study."
    Faced with these facts, some teachers who were not interested in work-study had to admit that work-study did indeed improve teaching quality. The teachers were convinced and gave 651 "labor production reports" a score of five or four. In the last final exam, among the 770 students, 300 failed one to four courses.
    Yang Lantian, the principal of Taiyuan Water Conservancy School, said: The planning work and labor production of all students have proved with eloquent facts that carrying out work-study greatly improves the political and ideological level and professional knowledge level of students. The benefits of work-study have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

    下乡五个月  胜读十年书
    ——记太原水利学校勤工俭学活动
    本报记者　水天生
    “勤工俭学真正好，半年收获大极了，现场实地去学习，敢想敢干能创造，收获能有这样大，全靠党的好领导。”这是流传在太原水利学校师生中的赞颂勤工俭学的一首诗。
    今年2月到7月底，太原水利学校开展了以流域治理规划为中心的勤工俭学活动，全校师生走遍山西省八十四个县，制定了汾河、滹沱河等三十六条河系的流域治理规划，通过五个月的劳动实践，该校在教学工作和师生政治思想上都起了大的变化。不久前，在全体师生举行的一次庆祝丰收大会上，校长杨兰田在报告中说：勤工俭学的收获，是党的教育方针的伟大胜利，资产阶级教育思想的彻底失败。
            一场大辩论
    太原水利学校教师，过去普遍存在着轻政治、轻实践的错误观点。讲水土保持和水利工程，只讲大型工程，却不讲农村需要的中小型工程；大量引用国外资料、书本上的原理和公式让学生死记，而不结合实际需要。学生虽然学水库，但却不知道水库究竟是啥样子；水利工程专业的一些学生连极其普通的知识如陡坡、跌水都不知道。由于教学脱离政治，学生缺乏为社会主义服务的观点，专业思想很不巩固。
    面对着严重的问题，太原水利学校师生在党的领导下掀起了教学革命。全体师生针对着“勤工俭学破坏了教育传统，学校只是传播高深理论的场所，下乡劳动势必降低教学质量”等等各式各样的论调展开辩论。通过辩论，大多数人认识到资产阶级教育只能培养出五谷不分、四体不勤的剥削阶级的知识分子，只有贯彻教育和劳动结合的方针才能培养出又红又专的知识分子。至此，错误思想受到严正批判，糊涂思想也得到澄清。该校领导制定勤工俭学的规划和措施，并决定全体师生下乡参加实际工作，以流域治理规划为中心开展勤工俭学活动。全校八百多个学生和五十多个教师高举教学革命的大旗，在农村水利建设高潮声中跨出教室，在晋南、晋中平原、塞上雁北和太行山区的汾河、漳河等三十六条河系沿岸和丛山峻岭中，开始了教育结合劳动的第一课。
  实践—知识的源泉
    在实践中学习，知识是多么丰富啊！走出教室的太原水利学校师生一个个莫不情绪高涨，在大自然中和实际斗争中师生们深入观察、学习，研究山川草木，人文地理，一面动手操作，知识领域扩大了，同时学到了不少有用的知识。到阳高县白澄河作规划的学生作洪水调查时，按照课本上说的做洪水调查，多次调查都不准确。通过劳动实践，师生们才发现调查洪水要全面考虑自然因素，死套公式不结合实际是不行的。到文水县文峪河作规划的学生张春兰在绘一张文峪河流域面积累加图时，虽然是破题儿第一遭，但实践解决了知识的不足。她反复在现场踏查、思考，亲自动手搜集资料，终于绘出了一张合格的图表。她说：劳动实践是增加实际知识，丰富理论知识的钥匙，只有把教学和生产劳动结合起来，才能学到真正的知识。农田水利工程专业二年级学生樊喜庆，在规划工作中边学边做，大胆编写了一份长达四万字的训练农村水利技术员的教材，这份教材内容实际，通俗易懂，受到农民欢迎。他说：这份教材编写成功是由于理论和实际碰了头的结果。如果坐在教室里，一辈子也编写不出来这份教材。通过劳动实践，绝大多数学生从根本不会做、到会做水利、水土保持、农、林的综合规划；不少学生能担负从选水库、设计库容、施工、编写规划报告等等一系列的工作。过去大多数不会测量和描绘地形图，现在都学会了。
    拜劳动人民为师！这是太原水利学校在与劳动人民接触后提出来的一个响亮的口号。他们每到一地便请劳动模范、土专家、老农为他们介绍经验知识，并到现场学习。农田水利等三个专业的四十一个师生在晋南作洓水河流域规划时，企图拿仅有的一些书本知识解决面临着的许多疑难问题，但都解决不了。后来向群众学习，依靠群众的智慧和力量进行规划时，问题好解决得多了。有一次他们在作综合利用土地时感到困难，但闻喜县干庆乡农业社支部书记和社长给他们讲授了一堂内容丰富的水土保持课后，师生们茅塞顿开，确定洓水河流域以发展农业为主，林牧为副，压缩农田，充分利用土地等等关键性的问题。教师刘承菽说：这次下乡学习了劳动人民创造的石山植树，旱涝两用地下泉，转山渠和综合利用土地技术措施等许多技术经验，是坐在学校里的知识分子连想也想不到的。通过实践，使她明确了知识分子必须向劳动人民学习，教学必须为生产服务。
    在实际斗争和劳动锻练中，这个学校的师生思想上起了巨大的变化。师生们下乡后看到男女老少在灯光下兴修水利大搞生产的时候，看到劳动人民艰苦朴素、勤劳勇敢作风的时候，激动得流出了眼泪，深深感到自己“五谷不分，四体不勤”的可耻。原来嫌农民脏的学生不再嫌脏了，说自己没有力气背不动行李的人没有了，并且放下知识分子的架子和农民同吃、同住、同劳动。水利专业二年级学生王阿民，下乡初期动辄要雇毛驴代步，可是在劳动人民向自然斗争的艰苦精神感召下，不但不再雇毛驴还亲手制成柳木扁担，为体弱的同学担行李，他在扁担上写道：“扁担软又软，担上行李卷，日行千里路，不苦还觉甜。”师生们还为了早日完成任务，夜以继日地苦战，不向困难低头。到灵石县作龙凤河规划的六个学生，攀登上满布棘针的峭壁悬崖的“鬼门关”进行勘测，工作虽然艰巨，但他们一想到这条河流规划好，全部建成后可以浇四十万亩土地，为灵石、介休两县人民造福时，就鼓起勇气，在十一天内完成河流纵横测量和水库地形测量的任务。到交城作文峪河规划的师生每当唱起著名的山西民歌：“交城山，交城水，不浇交城浇文水”时，决定要以现实来改变这首民歌的内容，作了文峪河既浇交城，又浇文水的流域规划后，愉快地和群众在一起唱起了“交城山，交城水，浇了交城浇文水”的新歌曲。在劳动实践中，许多学生对水利事业有了新的认识，对自己的专业热爱起来了。太原水利学校全校师生在五个月中共制订了汾河等三十六条河系的流域治理规划。规划包括中小型水库、小型电站、渠道、谷坊、封山育林、地埂、旱井、蓄水池等。这些工程全部付诸实现后，可以控制水土流失五千多万亩，发展灌溉面积三千五百万亩。这无可争辩的事实，使勤工俭学反对派和怀疑派哑口无言，一向深陷在书本里的教师也觉悟过来了。
      劳动生产报告
    太原水利学校师生下乡归来后，学校领导采取了与过去迥然不同的考试：让每个学生写一篇“劳动生产报告”。这是教学上又一次大胆的改革。
    在过去每当考试到来，学生们惶惶不安，开夜车背教条，囫囵吞枣，唯恐背不熟，考不及格。但这次空气却完全不同了，考试前，学生都丢开了课本，安静地翻阅自己从生产实际中学到的和搜集来的水利和水土保持等方面的知识和资料，专心致意地在思考问题，或者和同学展开热烈的讨论，然后根据各人的心得开始写“劳动生产报告”，向党交出了标志着政治思想和教学质量显著提高的试卷。
    生产劳动报告是对学生政治思想、业务知识一次真正的鉴定。它以最雄辩的事实证明了党的教育结合生产劳动的方针是培养又红又专人才的唯一方法。翻开每一份“劳动生产报告”，每个学生都联系自己的思想实际和体会，写下了在生产劳动中德育、智育、体育等各方面的收获。在“劳动生产报告”中，每个学生还做出一项河流、渠道、水库、水电站、桥梁、旱井规划和工程设计。这些规划和工程设计，既总结了劳动人民的经验，又有科学原理和技术说明，并且都可以拿到现场施工。水利工程建筑专业二年级学生张观泰上次期终考试四门功课不及格，但这次却写了一篇出色的“劳动生产报告”。他根据自然情况和社会经济情况的调查材料作出的榆社县泉水河的综合规划，并提出科学的、合乎农民需要的水库、渠道等设计。为什么这个半年前还是四门功课不及格的学生有这样的突飞猛进呢？张观泰说的好：在实践中，实际知识给他提供了丰富的理论根据；同时由于理论联系实际，学到的知识自己能够理解和巩固起来。农田水利专业二年级学生李怀杰过去为了考试经常死背讲义、笔记，闹得神经衰弱，对学习丧失了兴趣，曾经三番五次要求退学。但通过这次劳动实践，一切都变了。他在“劳动生产报告”中写道：“过去教学脱离实际，光知道死读书，这次参加生产劳动学到了真正的知识，不再背教条了，身体也强壮了。这完全是勤工俭学带来的好处。”
    面对着这些事实，一些对勤工俭学不感兴趣的教师不得不承认：勤工俭学确确实实提高了教学质量。教师们心服口服地在六百五十一份“劳动生产报告”上，评上五分或四分的成绩。而在上次期终考试的七百七十个学生中，一门到四门课程不及格的就有三百人。
    太原水利学校校长杨兰田说：全体学生的规划工作和劳动生产以雄辩的事实证明了开展勤工俭学大大地提高了学生政治思想水平和业务知识水平。勤工俭学的好处已经深入人心。
