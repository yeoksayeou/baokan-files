Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th TASS: The Soviet government issued a statement on the cessation of nuclear testing, saying: The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom conference on resolving the cessation of nuclear testing to be held in Geneva on October 31, has all the conditions to satisfactorily resolve the historic task of permanently ceasing the testing of weapons with the greatest destructive and lethal force in human history.

The Soviet government demands the immediate, universal, and permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and declares: "Continued delays in resolving the issue of ceasing nuclear testing will create increasing difficulties for reaching necessary agreements between countries in this regard."

The statement points out that after the Soviet government decided to cease nuclear testing starting on March 31 of this year, the US and British governments not only were unwilling to follow the Soviet Union's initiative, but instead began an unprecedentedly intense series of nuclear bomb explosions.

The statement also exposed the long-standing claim by the US and British governments that establishing supervision over the implementation of an agreement between countries on the cessation of nuclear testing is fundamentally impossible. The statement said that this claim is nothing more than an attempt to deceive the people of all countries and conceal their intention not to cease nuclear testing. Not long ago, the meeting of experts held in Geneva proved that it is entirely possible to supervise the universal cessation of nuclear testing, and that establishing a supervisory system is practically achievable.

The statement said that the Soviet government considers the US and British governments' suggestion to suspend nuclear testing for one year as completely unacceptable and firmly rejects it.

"The US and Britain, after accelerating the most intense testing to date, propose a one-year suspension of testing, clearly attempting to gain a unilateral military advantage over the Soviet Union."

The statement emphasized: "The actions of Western countries give the Soviet Union full rights to continue experimental explosions on a one-to-one basis according to the number of explosions conducted by the US and Britain combined, because the number of explosions it has conducted since the Soviet Union resumed testing is not yet equal to the number of nuclear explosions these countries have conducted since March 31, 1958. As long as the US and British governments continue to obstruct the reaching of an agreement and constantly create obstacles to reaching an agreement on the immediate and permanent cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing, then the Soviet government, out of concern for the security of the Soviet people, will inevitably act in this way."

The positions of the US and British governments on the issue of ceasing nuclear testing confronts the Soviet Union with the following choice: either reach an agreement on the universal and permanent cessation of nuclear testing, or the Soviet Union continues to conduct such testing. If the US and British governments are prepared to conclude the aforementioned agreement, then the Soviet Union can now sign such an agreement with them and immediately cease testing, even though the Soviet Union has conducted fewer experimental explosions than the United States and Britain.

The statement said that recently, as the Geneva talks approach, some people in the United States and Britain have spread rumors that the Soviet Union has "changed" its position on this issue and even refuses to stop experimental explosions altogether. US Secretary of State Dulles' statement on October 28 was made in this spirit, the basic meaning of the statement is: distorting the Soviet Union's position on the cessation of nuclear testing, shifting public attention from the fact that the US government stubbornly refuses to reach an agreement on the permanent cessation of nuclear testing.

In order to exonerate the US government, the US Secretary of State even fabricated the claim that the Soviet Union, during the Geneva expert talks, concluded that Western countries had overtaken the Soviet Union in nuclear research, and therefore "lost interest in stopping testing."

The statement emphasized that the above argument is absurd. If anyone fantasizes that the Soviet Union is "behind" in nuclear research, it is merely taking wishful thinking as reality.

The statement concluded by emphasizing that the Soviet Union's representatives attending the Geneva conference will strive to achieve the immediate, universal, and permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing. "If the US and British governments also hold the same attitude, then the issue of ceasing nuclear weapons testing will be thoroughly and completely resolved."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st TASS: In a note responding to the US Embassy, the Soviet government said that it hopes that the negotiations on the cessation of nuclear testing starting in Geneva on October 31 will result in all countries permanently ceasing nuclear weapons testing. The Soviet government will make every effort to achieve this goal.

The Soviet reply reiterated the Soviet government's attitude towards the Geneva conference on the issue of ceasing nuclear weapons testing, which has been stated in the Soviet notes of August 30 and October 1. This attitude is: the purpose of this Geneva conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should be to conclude an agreement on the permanent cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing, and to establish appropriate supervision over the implementation of this agreement.

The Soviet government expressed regret that its proposal to hold a meeting of foreign ministers in Geneva was not supported by the US government. The Soviet government still believes that holding a ministerial-level meeting may create the most favorable conditions for reaching an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing in the shortest possible time. However, given that the US Embassy's note indicates that the US government is in principle willing to send the US Secretary of State to Geneva at a certain stage of the negotiations, the Soviet government suggests that the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom participate in the meeting at a later stage, as this would undoubtedly help to more quickly reach the necessary agreement on the issue of ceasing nuclear weapons testing.

On the 30th, the Soviet government also delivered a reply with the same content to the British government.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 31st TASS: Representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom are scheduled to begin discussing the issue of ceasing nuclear weapons testing at the League of Nations building in Geneva today.

The Soviet delegation, led by Ambassador Tsarapkin, a member of the Collegium of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, the US delegation, led by Ambassador Wadsworth, and the British delegation, led by Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ormsby-Gore, have all arrived in Geneva. United Nations Secretary-General's representative Narayanan has also arrived in Geneva.

    苏联政府就苏美英日内瓦会议发表声明
    要求立即普遍永远停止核试验
    如美英继续阻挠达成协议苏联有权进行试验
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科30日讯：苏联政府就停止核试验发表声明说：10月31日将在日内瓦举行的苏联、美国和英国三国关于解决停止核试验的会议，拥有一切条件来圆满地解决永远停止试验人类历史上破坏力和杀伤力最大的武器这一历史性的任务。
    苏联政府要求立即普遍地永远停止核武器试验，并声明说：“继续拖延关于停止核试验问题的解决，就会给各国间在这方面达成必要的协议造成越来越多的困难”。
    声明指出，苏联政府决定从今年3月31日开始停止核试验以后，美英两国政府不仅不愿效法苏联的创举，相反，却开始了空前紧张的核弹爆炸。
    声明还揭露了美英两国政府长期以来，关于对各国间停止核试验协定的执行情况建立监督是根本不可能的这种说法。声明说，这种说法无非是想要欺骗各国人民，掩饰它们不想停止核试验的企图。不久前，在日内瓦举行的专家会议证明，对普遍停止核试验进行监督是完全可能的，建立监督制度实际上是可以实现的。
    声明说，苏联政府认为美英两国政府关于暂停核试验一年的建议是完全不能接受的，并且坚决加以拒绝。
    “美英两国在加速进行了迄今为止最紧张的试验以后，提出暂停试验一年的建议，显然是企图获得对苏联的单方面的军事优势。”
    声明强调说：“西方国家的行动给了苏联以充分的权利来按照美英两国加在一起所进行的爆炸数目，按比例一个对一个地继续进行试验性爆炸，因为在苏联恢复试验后它所进行的爆炸数目现在同这些国家自1958年3月31日以来所进行的核爆炸数目还不相等。只要美英两国政府继续阻挠达成协定并不断制造障碍就立即永远停止原子武器和氢武器试验达成协议，那么，苏联政府出于对苏联人民的安全的关怀，势必将这样行动。”
    美英两国政府在停止核试验问题上的立场使苏联面临这样的抉择：要末达成普遍地永久停止核试验的协议，要末苏联继续进行这种试验。如果美英两国政府准备缔结上述协定，那么，苏联现在就可以同它们一道签订这种协定，立即停止试验，虽然苏联比美国和英国进行的试验性爆炸要少。
    声明说，近来由于日内瓦谈判的逼近，在美国和英国有人散布谣言说，苏联“改变了”它在这个问题上的立场，并且甚至根本拒绝停止试验性爆炸。10月28日美国国务卿杜勒斯的声明就是本着这种精神而发表的，声明的基本意思是：歪曲苏联在停止核试验问题上的立场，转移公众对下述事实的注意力，即美国政府顽固地不愿意达成永远停止核试验的协议。
    美国国务卿为了替美国政府开脱，甚至捏造说，苏联在日内瓦专家谈判时得出了西方国家在核研究方面赶过了苏联的结论，因此“对停止试验失去了兴趣”。
    声明强调指出，上述论调是荒谬的。如果有人妄想苏联在核研究方面“落后”，那只不过是拿愿望当作现实而已。
    声明最后着重指出，苏联出席日内瓦会议的代表将争取达到立即、普遍地永久停止核武器试验。“如果美、英两国政府也抱有同样的态度，那么，停止核武器试验的问题，就将得到彻底的、完全的解决。”
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科31日讯：苏联政府在一份答复美国大使馆的照会说，苏联政府希望10月31日在日内瓦开始的关于停止核试验的谈判，将得到所有国家永远停止核武器试验的结果。苏联政府方面将尽一切努力来达到这个目的。
    苏联的复照重申了苏联政府对日内瓦停止核武器试验问题会议的态度，这种态度已在8月30日和10月1日苏联的照会中表明过。这个态度就是：这次苏、美、英三国日内瓦会议的目的应当是缔结一项关于永远停止原子武器和氢武器试验的协定，并对这一协定的执行建立应有的监督。
    苏联政府表示遗憾说，它关于在日内瓦举行外交部长级会议的建议没有得到美国政府的支持。苏联政府仍然认为，举行部长级会议可能为在最短期间达成停止核武器试验的协议创造最有利的条件。但是，鉴于美国大使馆的照会中表示美国政府原则上愿意在谈判的一定阶段派美国国务卿到日内瓦去，苏联政府建议苏、美、英三国外交部长在较迟的阶段参加会议，因为这样无疑地会有助于就停止核武器试验问题更迅速地达成必要的协议。
    苏联政府30日还把同样内容的复照交给英国政府。
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联、美国和英国代表定于今天在日内瓦国联大厦开始讨论停止核武器试验问题。
    以苏联外交部部务委员查拉普金大使为首的苏联代表团、以华兹沃斯大使为首的美国代表团和以协办外交事务国务大臣奥姆斯比—戈尔为首的英国代表团都已到达日内瓦。联合国秘书长代表纳拉扬也到达日内瓦。
