Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 12th: German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl said today that the government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes and supports the Soviet proposal to amend the Potsdam Agreement. This proposal "is in the interests of all the German people and all the people of Europe." He also said that the Bonn government should seriously consider the recent speech by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev.

Grotewohl made these remarks at a press conference held here at noon today.

Grotewohl said that the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the elimination of fascist and militarist forces are very important to the German people, but under the guidance of US policy, this agreement has completely lost its effect in West Germany.

Grotewohl emphasized that the issue of a peace treaty with Germany is the issue of greatest concern to the German people. The people of the two Germanies should sit down together and decide their future. Adenauer's refusal to allow the German people to speak in the drafting of a peace treaty with Germany would turn this treaty into a Treaty of Versailles. Only by consulting and deciding together with representatives of the German people can the preconditions for the reunification of Germany be created. Grotewohl pointed out that Comrade Khrushchev's speech at the Soviet-Polish People's Friendship Congress in Moscow was of great political significance. He said: "Khrushchev's speech provides an opportunity to get the German question out of the stalemate caused by Bonn's policies."

Premier Grotewohl said that the Berlin question is only one of many questions, and the main question is peaceful understanding. Of course, the Berlin question cannot be absent from this question. He pointed out that the US, UK, and France have no right to occupy West Berlin, and their privileges in Berlin are not in the interests of all the German people and the people of Berlin.

Grotewohl condemned the Bonn government's reactionary measures of depriving the people of democratic rights and suppressing the workers' movement. He said that the German Democratic Republic will fully support those workers who are fighting for mutual understanding between East and West Germany and who are being persecuted.

Grotewohl also pointed out that the Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone is of increasing significance.

At the press conference, the government of the German Democratic Republic's memorandum on the threat to peace posed by the policy of arming West Germany, as well as the German Democratic Republic Foreign Ministry's "White Paper on the Aggressive Policy of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany," were distributed to reporters.

Xinhua News Agency, November 12th: According to TASS, Berlin, November 11th: The Democratic Berlin City Council and the City Government recently suggested that the West Berlin authorities sign a trade agreement to establish closer economic ties between the two parts of Berlin.

According to the German News Agency, although the implementation of these proposals would greatly improve the material situation of West Berlin residents, the West Berlin City Government rejected these proposals at today's meeting. (Attached picture)

    格罗提渥支持苏联建议
    美英法无权霸占西柏林
    德国人民应该坐在一起决定自己的未来
    新华社柏林12日电　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥今天说，德意志民主共和国政府欢迎并且支持苏联提出的关于修改波茨坦协定的建议。这个建议“是符合全德国和全欧洲人民的利益的”。他又说，波恩政府应当认真考虑一下苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫最近的一次讲话。
    格罗提渥是在今天中午在这里举行的记者招待会上说这番话的。
    格罗提渥说，波茨坦协定关于肃清法西斯、军国主义势力的规定对德国人民非常重要，但是在美国的政策指导下，这个协定在西德已经完全失去了它的作用。
    格罗提渥强调说，对德和约问题是德国人民最关心的问题。两个德国的人民应该坐在一起，决定自己的未来。阿登纳不允许德国人民在制定对德和约时发言，这就会使这个和约变成凡尔赛条约。只有和德国人民的代表一道商量决定，才能为重新统一德国创造前提。格罗提渥指出，赫鲁晓夫同志在莫斯科举行的苏波人民友好大会上的讲话具有重大的政治意义。他说：“赫鲁晓夫的讲话提供了机会，使德国问题走出由于波恩的政策而造成的僵局。”
    格罗提渥总理说，柏林问题只是许多问题之一，而主要的问题是和平谅解。当然，在这个问题中不能没有柏林问题。他指出，美英法无权霸占西柏林，它们在柏林享有特权是不符合全德国和柏林人民的利益的。
    格罗提渥谴责波恩政府剥夺人民民主权利、镇压工人运动的反动措施。他说，民主德国将全力支持那些为德国东西双方互相谅解而斗争的和遭受迫害的工人。
    格罗提渥还指出，波兰政府关于建立无原子武器区的建议具有愈来愈大的意义。
    在记者招待会上，向记者们散发了德意志民主共和国政府关于武装西德的政策造成对和平的威胁的备忘录以及德意志民主共和国外交部出版的“关于德意志联邦共和国政府的侵略政策的白皮书”。
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社柏林11日讯：民主柏林市议会和市政府最近建议西柏林当局签订贸易协定以建立柏林两部分的更紧密的经济联系。
    据德意志通讯社报道，尽管实现这些建议会在很大程度上改善西柏林居民的物质境况，但西柏林市政府在今天的会议上拒绝了这些建议。（附图片）
