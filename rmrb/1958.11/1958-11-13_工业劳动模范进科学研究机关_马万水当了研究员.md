Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th: Ma Wanshui, a renowned industrial labor model and miner from the Pangjiabu Mine Engineering Office of the Longyan Iron and Steel Company in Hebei Province, has been appointed as a special researcher at the Non-Ferrous Metallurgical Mine Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry.

Ma Wanshui came from a poor family and only attended school for a year or two. He worked as a tunneling worker in coal and iron mines for more than ten years. After liberation, he created operating techniques for drilling holes based on different rock types, which dramatically improved mine tunneling efficiency. In 1950, the tunneling team he led was recognized as a model team and attended the National Labor Model Conference. Over the years, he and his team members created a complete set of mine tunneling experiences. These advanced experiences increased mine tunneling efficiency from 54 meters per month to 260.7 meters, making it a red banner in national mine tunneling. Later, although Ma Wanshui served as the director of the mine engineering office, he still often worked with the team to research and improve technology.

    工业劳动模范进科学研究机关
    马万水当了研究员
    据新华社天津12日电　著名的工业劳动模范、矿工出身的河北省龙烟钢铁公司庞家堡矿山工程处主任马万水，已被冶金工业部有色冶金矿山科学研究所聘为特约研究员。
    马万水出身贫苦家庭，只念过一两年书，连续在煤矿和铁矿当掘进工人达十余年，解放后，他创造出根据不同岩石，采取多种打眼的操作技术，使矿山掘进效率空前提高。1950年，他所领导的掘进小组，被评为出席全国劳动模范大会的模范组。几年来，他和全组工人一起创造了一整套矿山掘进经验。这些先进经验，使矿山掘进效率由月进五十四公尺提高到二百六十点七公尺，成为全国矿山掘进的一面红旗。以后，马万水虽然担任了矿山工程处主任，他还经常和小组工人一起研究改进技术。
