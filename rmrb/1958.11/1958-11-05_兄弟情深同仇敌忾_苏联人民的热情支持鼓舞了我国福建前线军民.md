Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 4th: With great internationalist spirit and immense enthusiasm, the Soviet people are concerned about and support the just struggle of the Chinese people against American imperialist aggression and for the liberation of our territory, Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu.

In hundreds of letters to the military and civilians on the Fujian front from Chinese students in the Soviet Union from Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Odessa, and other places, it was said that when Soviet comrades heard the news of American imperialist war provocations in the Taiwan Strait, they held rallies and demonstrations to protest American imperialist aggression against China. Chinese students studying at the Leningrad Institute of Engineering and Economics and the Sverdlovsk Mining Institute wrote in letters to the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front and the faculty and students of Xiamen University: In the Soviet Union, whether on the streets or in the alleys, whether in factories or collective farms, you will encounter men and women, old and young, who enthusiastically stop them and express their cordiality: "To invade China is to invade the Soviet Union!" "If anyone dares to touch our brother—China, let them try!" Chinese student Yu Shiqing, who is studying in the Soviet Union, wrote in a letter that his Soviet friend said to him: "For the sake of the Chinese people and for the cause of world peace, once war breaks out, we will not hesitate to go to the front line and, together with you, eliminate the root of war—American imperialism!"

Fu Yongbao, a Chinese student at the Ural Kirov Institute of Technology, wrote to the officers and soldiers on the Fujian front: "In this school, whenever Soviet students hear that our Fujian Front People's Liberation Army has sunk, shot down, or damaged Chiang Kai-shek's warships and aircraft, they celebrate it like their own victory and tell each other the good news everywhere."

Xiamen University, which stands on the front line of coastal defense, has received enthusiastic support and concern from the Soviet people, especially the young students of Leningrad University, in the struggle against American imperialist war provocations and the Kuomintang's frantic sabotage. When the news of the Jinmen Kuomintang army shelling Xiamen University reached Leningrad University in the Soviet Union, the secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of Leningrad University, entrusted by all the members of the school's Communist Youth League, made a long-distance call from thousands of miles away to Xiamen University, expressing warm concern, support, and greetings. They said in the phone call: "The Soviet people, the people of Leningrad, and all the faculty and students of Leningrad University will always stand with the Chinese people. We firmly support your just struggle against American imperialist aggression and for the liberation of Taiwan. To infringe upon China is to infringe upon the Soviet Union. The Soviet people will contribute all their strength to defend peace."

The Soviet people's kind concern and firm support have brought tremendous encouragement and strength to the military and civilians on the Fujian front. They have expressed their determination to repay the great friendship of the Soviet people by achieving greater victories in the struggle against American imperialist aggression and for the liberation of our territory. The faculty and students of Xiamen University recently wrote a letter to Soviet youth, saying: "Your support and concern for our Xiamen University in adhering to the struggle against the enemy on the coastal defense front, adhering to teaching and scientific research, and adhering to labor, has greatly encouraged us. We are happy and proud to have such a socialist family and to have a friend like the Soviet Union."

    兄弟情深同仇敌忾
    苏联人民的热情支持鼓舞了我国福建前线军民
    新华社福建前线4日电　苏联人民以伟大的国际主义精神和极大的热情，关怀和支持我国人民反对美帝国主义侵略和解放我国领土台湾、澎湖、金门和马祖的正义斗争。
    我国留苏学生从莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、敖德萨等地写给福建前线军民的数百封来信中都说，当苏联的同志们听到美帝国主义在台湾海峡进行战争挑衅的消息后，纷纷集会、游行，抗议美帝国主义对中国的侵略。在列宁格勒工程经济学院、斯维尔德洛夫城矿业学院学习的我国留学生，给福建前线解放军官兵和厦门大学师生的信中说：在苏联，不论是在大街或小巷，不论是在工厂还是集体农庄，都会遇到一些男人和女人、老人和青年人热情地把他们拦住，亲切地向他们表示：“侵略中国就是侵略苏联！” “如果有人胆敢碰我们的兄弟——中国，那就让他们试试看！”我国留苏学生俞时清在信中写到，和他在一起的苏联朋友对他说：“为了中国人民，为了世界和平事业，一旦战争爆发，我们就毫不犹豫地走上前线，和你们一起，把战争根源——美帝国主义消灭！”
    乌拉尔基洛夫工学院中国留学生傅永宝写信告诉福建前线官兵：“在这个学校里，苏联学生们在每次听到我福建前线人民解放军击沉击落击伤蒋军军舰和飞机的时候，就像庆贺他们自己的胜利一样，到处相互转告报捷。”
    屹立在海防前线的厦门大学在反对美帝国主义战争挑衅和蒋军疯狂破坏的斗争中，得到了苏联人民特别是列宁格勒大学青年学生的热情支持和关怀。当金门蒋军炮击厦门大学的消息传到苏联列宁格勒大学时，列宁格勒大学的共青团团委书记受学校全体共青团员的委托，从万里外给厦门大学打来长途电话，表示热情的关怀、支持和问候。他们在电话中说：“苏联人民、列宁格勒人民、列宁格勒大学的全体师生，永远同中国人民站在一起。我们坚决支持你们反对美帝国主义侵略和解放台湾的正义斗争，侵犯中国就是侵犯苏联，苏联人民将为保卫和平而贡献出自己的一切力量。”
    苏联人民的亲切关怀和坚决支持，给我国福建前线军民带来巨大的鼓舞和力量。他们纷纷表示，以在反对美帝国主义侵略，解放我国领土的斗争中取得更大的胜利，来答谢苏联人民的伟大友谊。厦门大学的师生不久前给苏联青年写了一封信，信里说：“您们对我们厦门大学在海防前线坚持对敌斗争、坚持教学和科学研究、坚持劳动所表示的支持和关怀，使我们受到巨大的鼓舞。我们为有这样一个社会主义大家庭和有苏联这样的朋友而感到幸福和自豪。”
