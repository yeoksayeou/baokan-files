    The "Turn" is Not Yet Complete
    Yang Mei
    It is said that in some people's communes, when the system of "eating without money" was implemented, a "suffering loss" theory emerged. Some commune members with more labor power and fewer people in their families felt that those households with less labor power and more people were "taking advantage" of them. A newsletter in the newspaper told of a middle peasant who originally thought he was losing out because his whole family of three could work, so he did not approve of the "eating without money" method. Later, he thought that his son would get married and have children in the future, and if he suffered a little now, he would take advantage of others later. Thinking this way, he slowly came around and expressed his firm support for the "eating without money" system.
    It is good that this commune member changed his attitude. People are always accustomed to initially recognizing and judging whether something is good or bad from their own immediate interests. But is this turn complete? How much communist element does it contain? Does the communist spirit of "one for all, all for one" simply mean that if you have a son to be raised collectively, I must also provide a daughter to society, a simple one-equals-one "everyone doesn't lose out" mentality? Are those without children or with few children at a disadvantage or unlucky?
    To see it this way would be to vulgarize communism.
    Communists also talk about taking losses and gaining advantages, but they differ from individualists in that they talk about big losses and big advantages. Communism is about allowing all the people to obtain the greatest "advantage." To achieve this goal, everyone needs to abandon their small "advantages" (of course, this does not allow some people to take advantage of others). If everyone is concerned about their own small advantages, the collective will certainly suffer a big loss. Moreover, communism is created jointly by everyone, and its fruits are shared by everyone. Whether you are a young and strong youth, or an old and frail elder, or a child of tender age, no one has lived through it since childhood, and everyone will get old, everyone belongs to this collective, his elders are everyone's elders, his children are everyone's children. Therefore, from an individual point of view, in addition to being able to contribute some wealth to society during their youth, they rely on society to raise them in their childhood and old age, and they have not suffered any losses. Only when every able-bodied person contributes all their strength will the material wealth of society become more and more abundant, and the lives of people—including men, women, old, and young—become more and more fulfilling. People with communist ideas regard labor as an obligation to society, as a joyful enjoyment, and labor will never be associated with the word "loss." Moreover, no matter how strong a person's labor is, its role is equal to zero without the collective. Without the power of the collective, can we engage in large-scale water conservancy, launch high-yield satellites, or run industries on a large scale? The so-called collective is by no means a quantitative combination of three plus two equals five, but a qualitative leap: it can create miracles that every single person cannot accomplish. Everyone relies on it and gains a great "advantage." If people calculate who has strong labor power and who has weak labor power from their own narrow perspective, then in the end, they can only break up with each other to avoid losing out, but they suffer a big loss—they lose the greatest benefit brought by the collective.
    Those who advocate the "suffering loss" theory will slowly come around. However, if the turn is not thorough, it will leave a hiding place for the selfish and self-interested bourgeois individualism. If this small individualistic residence is retained, it is still inevitable to make small calculations in collective life, to see whether one is losing out or gaining an advantage. But how can this not affect the smooth development of collective undertakings?

### “弯”还转得不彻底

    “弯”还转得不彻底
    杨眉
    据说有些人民公社里在实行吃饭不要钱的制度时，曾经出现过一种“吃亏论”。有的劳动力多、人口少的社员，觉得自己被那些劳力少、人口多的户“占了便宜”。报上登过一篇通讯，说有一个中农原来也是认为自己吃亏的，因为他全家三口人都能劳动，所以他不赞成吃饭不要钱的办法。后来一想，自己的儿子将来结了婚，也要生儿育女，现在吃点亏，以后也会占别人的便宜。这么一想，心里就慢慢转过弯来，也就表示坚决拥护吃饭不要钱的制度了。
    这位公社社员转变了态度是好事。人们总是习惯于最初从切身的利益去认识和判断某一件事是好还是坏。可是，这个弯转得彻底不彻底呢？其中又含有多少共产主义成分？难道共产主义的“我为人人，人人为我”的精神，就是你有一个儿子要集体抚养，我也必须来一个女儿交给社会，这样简单地一等于一的“大家不吃亏”么？难道那些没有子女或子女少的人就吃亏倒霉了么？
    这样看的话，就未免把共产主义庸俗化了。
    共产主义者也是要讲吃亏和便宜的，可是他与个人主义者不同，讲的是大吃亏和大便宜。共产主义就是为了让全体人民得到最大的“便宜”。为了实现这个目的，就需要每个人抛弃自己的小“便宜”（当然，更不允许这一部分人占那一部分人便宜）。如果人人都计较个人的小便宜，集体就一定吃大亏了。而且，共产主义是大家来共同创造的，它的果实为大家共同享有。无论你是年轻力壮的青年，或是年老力衰的老者，或是正当孩提时代的儿童，谁也打从小时候过过，每个人都还要老，每个人都是属于这个集体的，他的老人就是大家的老人，他的孩子就是大家的孩子。因此，从个人来说，除了青壮年时代能够为社会创造一些财富外，幼年和老年的时候都要依靠社会来抚养，自己并没有吃什么亏。也只有每一个能劳动的人，把自己的一切力量都贡献了出来，社会的物质财富才会愈来愈多，人们——包括男女老幼的生活才会愈来愈美满。具有共产主义思想的人，把劳动看作是一种对社会的义务，看作是一种愉快的享受，劳动，永远不会跟“吃亏”这个词有任何联系。何况，一个人的劳力即使再强，离开集体它的作用也就等于零。没有集体的力量，能够大闹水利化，大放丰产卫星，大办工业么？所谓集体，决不是三加二等于五的量的组合，而是质的飞跃：它能够创造每一个单个的人所不能办到的奇迹。每一个人都依靠它而得到了大“便宜”。如果人们都从自己的鼻子尖下来计较谁的劳力强、谁的劳力弱，那么最后只好彼此散伙才会互不吃亏，然而却吃了个大亏——失掉了集体所带来的最大的利益。
    吃亏论者总会慢慢转过弯来的。但是，如果转得不彻底，就会给自私自利的资产阶级个人主义思想留下一个藏身之所。留住这个个人主义的小住所，总还是不免要在集体生活中打打自己的小算盘，看看是吃亏还是占便宜。但这怎能不影响集体事业的顺利发展呢？
