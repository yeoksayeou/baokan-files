    Soviet Industry's Development and Achievements since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
    Zasiadko, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union
    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, convened in February 1956, formulated a magnificent program for further developing communist construction.
    Led by the Communist Party, the Soviet people, implementing the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress, are greeting the 41st anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution with new and tremendous achievements in developing the economy and culture and further improving the material welfare of the Soviet people. They have taken a new and giant step towards the bright future of mankind—the path of communism.
        The Development of Industrial Production
    A characteristic of the Soviet Union's economic development is the continuous and rapid growth of industrial production. The total industrial output in 1957 increased by 22% compared to 1955, before the 20th Congress of the CPSU. Industrial output in the first nine months of 1958 increased by 10% compared to the same period in 1957. The industrial products produced in 1958 will be approximately fifty times that of 1917. That is to say, the Soviet Union now produces in seven days the equivalent of the entire industrial output of 1917.
    Our country has become one of the most industrially developed countries in the world in the shortest historical period. In terms of industrial output, we have far surpassed the capitalist countries of Europe and are confidently catching up with the United States.
    The speed of Soviet industrial development is beyond the reach of capitalist countries. This superiority of the socialist economic system embodies the fact that socialism will inevitably defeat capitalism in the economic competition. From 1918 to 1957, Soviet industrial production increased by an average of 10.1% annually, while US industrial production increased by an average of only 3.2% annually during the same period. At the same time, the superiority of socialist economic development speed is even more pronounced in the era of peaceful economic construction. For example, in the eleven pre-war years from 1930 to 1940 and the eleven post-war years from 1947 to 1957, the average annual growth rate of Soviet industry was 16.2%, while that of the United States was only 2.7%.
    It is very important that in recent years the Soviet Union has not only surpassed the United States in terms of growth rate, but also in terms of absolute increase in product output. For example, from 1953 to 1957, the Soviet Union's absolute increase in iron production averaged 2.4 million tons per year, while the United States' was 800,000 tons; the Soviet Union's steel was 3.3 million tons, and the United States' was 300,000 tons; the Soviet Union's cement was 3.2 million tons, and the United States' was 1.2 million tons; the Soviet Union's oil was 11.4 million tons, and the United States' was 8.8 million tons; the Soviet Union's coal (converted to hard coal) was 30.8 million tons, and the United States' was 6.2 million tons.
    In the United States, the total industrial production in the first seven months of 1958 decreased by 10.2%, and steel production decreased by 36.5%. In the first half of 1958, the United States' iron production decreased by 38.3%, coal mining decreased by 22%, and oil extraction decreased by 14%. Industrial production declines have also occurred in other capitalist countries.
    Lenin's doctrine of prioritizing the development of heavy industry is the foundation of the entire national economy of the Soviet Union, the foundation for further consolidating the country's strength, and the basis for continuously improving the material welfare of the Soviet people. It is by consistently adhering to Lenin's doctrine that the Soviet Union has achieved tremendous achievements in industrial development.
    In just the two years of 1956 and 1957, that is, in the first two years after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the production of means of production in the Soviet Union expanded by 24%. Compared with 1917, the production volume of heavy industry has increased approximately one hundredfold in 1958.
    Due to the implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the adoption of new production equipment has been significantly strengthened in the past three years, the use of existing production equipment has been improved, the work of manufacturing and using new machines has been accelerated, production has been continuously improved technically, and on this basis, and on the basis of further development of socialist competition, labor productivity has increased year by year, all of which have been of decisive significance for the development of Soviet industry.
    The reorganization of industrial and construction management, initiated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and warmly supported by the entire Soviet people, has had a particularly positive impact on the work of Soviet industry. The reorganization of industrial and construction management has ensured the further development of Lenin's principle of democratic centralism and promoted the broad masses of working people's initiative in managing production, exploring and using production potential.
    After the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the most important heavy industrial departments are characterized by the following developments:
          Ferrous Metallurgy Industry
    The ferrous metallurgy industry has achieved the greatest achievements. In 1958, the Soviet Union produced approximately 40 million tons of iron, 55 million tons of steel, and 43 million tons of steel products. Compared with the eve of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, that is, with 1955, the production of pig iron and steel increased by 20%, and the production of steel products increased by 21%. Compared with 1913, the total production of these most important products for the national economy increased by 9.4 times, 13 times, and 12 times, respectively. The pig iron, steel, and steel products produced by a single Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant exceeded the country's total production in 1913.
    The scale of Soviet ferrous metal production ranks first in Europe and second in the world, second only to the United States. In 1957, the Soviet Union produced more steel than the total of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium. The four iron and steel plants built only during the Soviet regime—Magnitogorsk, Kuznetsk, Nizhny Tagil, and Zaporozhye—smelted more iron and steel than France.
    The rapid growth of ferrous metal production is due to the addition of new production capacity on the one hand, and the improvement of the work of metallurgical combined units on the other, which is achieved through the merging of major combined units and the improvement of their structure, mechanization and automation of production, improvement of labor organization and work for preparing raw materials and fuels for steelmaking, adoption of advanced technical regulations, and various new raw materials.
    Recently, the Soviet Union has been prioritizing the construction of huge mechanized and automated blast furnaces with a volume of 1,400 to 1,700 cubic meters.
    In 1957, the utilization of blast furnaces increased by 19% compared to 1950 and by 33.5% compared to 1940, and open-hearth furnaces increased by 30% and 65% accordingly. These achievements are due to the strengthening of technical regulations in blast furnace production, such as increasing the pressure of the furnace top gas, increasing the temperature of the blast, using self-fluxing sinter, natural gas, and comprehensive automation, and using oxygen in steelmaking, strengthening the temperature of the furnace, and using major refractory materials.
    The Soviet Union has reached the world's peak in the utilization of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces.
    For example, in advanced enterprises such as the Magnitogorsk and Kuznetsk steel plants and other steel plants, the utilization of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces is 15%-20% higher than the national average in the Soviet Union.
            Coal Mining Industry
    The coal mining industry occupies an important position in the Soviet economy.
    This year, our country's coal mining volume has increased sixteen times compared with 1913, reaching approximately 496 million tons, which is 105 million tons more than in 1955. Therefore, the growth in coal production in the past three years is 3.6 times the total mining volume in 1913.
    The Soviet Union's coal production greatly exceeds that of European capitalist countries, and this year our coal mining volume will exceed that of the United States.
    This clearly shows the Soviet miners' great creative labor in building a powerful production technology base for the coal industry and in continuously developing the technology of the coal industry.
    In recent years, the mechanization of the coal mining industry has significantly expanded. The mechanization level of coal loading at the coal mining working face has increased from 33% in 1955 to 39.5% in the first half of 1958, and the mechanization of coal loading and rock work in the preparation of roadways has increased from 47% to 54%.
    In the Donetsk, Kuznetsk, and Karaganda mining areas, the degree of mechanization of coal loading using conveyor belts has reached 45%-70%, and the degree of mechanization of coal loading and rock preparation in the preparation of working faces has reached 68%-70%. Metal supports have been widely used in the recovery working faces and preparation working faces, and mechanized supports, shallow-cut coal mining combined machines, and non-disassembly conveyors have begun to be used.
    Great work has been carried out in improving tunnel systems and adopting retreating mining methods in recovery areas and mining fields.
    Continuously expanding the adoption of the most economical open-pit mining methods is of great significance. In 1958, 96 million tons of coal will be mined using this method, which is 1.5 times that of 1955 and 15 times that of the pre-war 1940.
    In the coal mining industry, the method of efficient hydraulic mining has begun to be used on a large scale, and the adoption of other rational methods of coal mining is also continuously expanding.
        Petroleum and Gas Industry
    The petroleum industry and the gas industry are also advancing at full speed. In 1958, the oil extracted reached 113 million tons, which is an increase of 60% compared with 1955. During this period, the volume of natural gas and associated gas increased threefold, almost reaching 29 billion cubic meters. The technology of oil extraction and processing is also constantly improving. Due to the adoption of new and powerful drilling machine tools, electric drills, and improved labor organization, the monthly drilling speed of each oil and gas well increased by approximately 20% in production well drilling and by 36% in exploration well drilling between 1956 and 1958.
    In recent years, the method of hydraulic fracturing of rock formations has been widely used to expand the flow rate of drilling wells. In the exploitation of oil mines, the adoption of the methods of water injection within the boundary and water injection outside the boundary has greatly increased, which can save a lot in mining and can also extract oil more fully.
    The installation of new, more powerful technical equipment in oil refineries, the comprehensive automation and mechanization of oil refinery production, has significantly expanded the volume of oil refining and reduced the construction costs of oil refineries.
    In order to further accelerate the expansion of new equipment in oil refining, preparations are now being made to manufacture vacuum distillation units with an annual production capacity of 6 million tons; catalytic cracking units with an annual production capacity of 2 to 2.5 million tons; powerful catalytic reforming units; and huge units for producing lubricating oil.
    The production of petrochemical products is developing more and more widely; for example, synthetic alcohol, synthetic fatty acids, alcohol, and others.
    The Soviet Union is now further developing the fuel base of the national economy by prioritizing the development of the most economical fuels, namely oil and gas.
    This can achieve a large saving of social labor and greatly contribute to accelerating the development speed of the national economy.
    Therefore, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government stipulated that in the next fifteen years, the annual output of gas should reach 270 billion to 320 billion cubic meters, which is thirteen to fifteen times the total volume of gas extracted and produced in 1957. This can guarantee a fundamental change in the structural balance of our fuel, greatly reducing the proportion of coal and replacing it with more economical various oil fuels and natural gas. This large-scale change can be realized in the next few years.
            Power Industry
    Significant achievements have also been made in the development of electrification of the Soviet national economy. In the past three years, electricity production has increased by 36%, and will reach 230 billion kilowatt-hours in 1958. At the same time, the electricity produced by hydroelectric power stations has almost doubled. This can improve the power supply to industry and cities, as well as massively develop the electrification of railway transportation.
    Switching to the construction of huge power stations has greatly promoted the further development of electrification, which can reduce the cost of electricity and the investment amount per unit of installed equipment capacity.
    In addition to the huge hydroelectric power stations that have already been built, the world's largest Volga Hydroelectric Power Station named after Lenin has been fully powered up, with a power generation capacity of 2.3 million kilowatts. The construction projects of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station with a power generation capacity of 2.3 million kilowatts (the first batch of combined units of this hydroelectric power station will start generating electricity in 1958), the Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station with a power generation capacity of 3.6 million kilowatts, and other hydroelectric power stations have been vigorously launched. In addition, the construction of many thermal power stations with a power generation capacity of 1 million to 2 million kilowatts has also begun.
    In order to greatly improve the capacity of power stations in a short period of time with only a small amount of money, thereby accelerating the speed of electrification and saving time, thermal power stations using cheap open-pit mining coal and natural gas will be prioritized in recent years.
    The level of power technology has also been significantly improved, and the capacity of power stations under construction and the unit production capacity of the combined units that have already been started up have been improved. At present, powerful turbo generators with a power generation capacity of 50,000, 100,000, and 150,000 kilowatts have been installed in the power stations of various regions. The proportion of high-pressure combined units that have been installed in the thermal power stations of various regions is approximately 60%, while in the past it was only 20%.
    The atomic energy power industry has also been further developed. Several large-scale atomic energy power stations are currently under construction. The first phase of one of the power stations has been completed this year and has begun to generate electricity, with a power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts.
    In recent years, some 400 kilovolt high-voltage transmission lines have been erected, and the construction of 500 kilovolt lines has begun, which has laid the foundation for establishing a unified domestic power system.
              Chemical Industry
    The chemical industry is also developing rapidly, and this year's output will increase by 40% compared with 1955. At present, the chemical industry produces more products in three days than the entire year's output of pre-revolutionary Russia in 1913.
    In the past three years, the production of mineral fertilizers has increased by 27%, of which nitrogen fertilizer has increased by 36.5%. At the same time, large-scale pesticide production has been organized for agriculture.
    The production of sulfuric acid has increased by 27%, of which the production of sulfuric acid using used sulfur dioxide has increased to 1.5 times.
    The production of alcohol refined from crude oil has developed particularly rapidly, which is of great economic significance. The output of artificial alcohol in 1958 will almost quadruple compared with 1955. In this way, a large amount of alcohol refined from grain can be replaced in industrial needs, from which 100 million poods of grain can be saved.
    During this period, the production of ammonia gas using waste gas has also been organized on a large scale. The production of plastics and synthetic resins, artificial fibers, and synthetic fibers has increased to one and a half times, which has greatly promoted the increase in the output of daily necessities and made it possible to replace a large amount of non-ferrous metals with cheaper materials.
    In the years after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, a new chemical industry department was established—organic silicon synthesis—and high-quality organic silicon paints were produced for the power industry and the radio industry.
    The production of synthetic rubber has expanded. Many new varieties of synthetic rubber have been mastered. The production of rubber using synthetic ethanol has doubled.
    Due to the wide adoption of plastics, rubber, and film as a large number of new materials and products in production as a result of scientific research. Materials for rocket technology necessary for launching artificial earth satellites were manufactured.
    At present, in order to implement the resolution of the May Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU on accelerating the development of the chemical industry, especially accelerating the production of synthetic materials, various tasks are being widely carried out. This resolution stipulates that by the end of 1965, the production capacity of artificial fibers and synthetic fibers will be 4.6 times higher than in 1957, plastics and synthetic resins will be eight times higher, and synthetic rubber will be 3.4 times higher.
          Machine Manufacturing Industry
    The machine manufacturing industry, which is the foundation of technological progress in the entire national economy, has also achieved outstanding achievements. While the production of various departments of the machine manufacturing industry has increased, the technological perfection of machines has also been greatly improved. Factories can produce a large number of technologically advanced new machines.
    It is sufficient to illustrate this that more than 4,500 important new types of machines, machinery, instruments, and other equipment have been manufactured in the past three years.
    In the field of heavy machinery manufacturing, the production volume of power industry and metallurgical industry equipment has been particularly increased. The output of steam turbines has increased by 33%, and the output of gas turbines has increased to 7.5 times. The production of turbines is developed based on the principle of increasing its unit capacity and adopting high steam parameters in steam turbines. Steam turbines with a power generation capacity of 200,000 kilowatts and hydro turbines with a power generation capacity of 105,000 kilowatts have been manufactured, and the production of hydro turbines with a power generation capacity of 200,000 kilowatts and gas turbines with a planned power generation capacity of 50,000 kilowatts is being prepared.
    The production of blast furnace equipment has increased to 1.6 times. The production of many advanced rapid thin plate machines and other rolling mills is being prepared, including the world's largest thin plate machine, which has an annual output of 3.5 million tons.
    Walking excavators that can excavate 25 cubic meters of soil at a time and have an arm length of 100 meters have been manufactured for excavation work, and excavators that can excavate 35 cubic meters of soil at a time are being designed.
    The manufacture of automatic and semi-automatic lathes and automatic forging presses has increased to more than two times, and the manufacture of automatic conveyor belts for lathes has increased to one and a half times.
    Due to the replacement of railway transportation with newer and more advanced traction tools, the production of high-horsepower diesel locomotives and electric locomotives has also greatly increased. Various shunting diesel locomotives with 1,100 horsepower, 750 horsepower, 400 horsepower, and 150 horsepower are being planned and prepared for production. Steam locomotives are no longer being manufactured.
    The variety of machines produced for the mechanization of civil engineering and road construction has also increased a lot, and there are 159 new machines submitted for manufacturing in just 1956 and 1957.
    In the power industry, the mass production of a large number of new types of power equipment has begun, including 400 kilovolt high-voltage electrical devices. The first turbo generator with a power generation capacity of 200,000 kilowatts that uses hydrogen with increased pressure to cool the rotor coil has been manufactured. A large number of new electric motors and generators are currently being planned.
    In the automobile manufacturing industry, while increasing production, many new and modern styles of small cars and large cars have been produced to replace a large number of outdated old-style cars. There are currently twelve new types of trucks, four types of small cars, and five types of large cars being produced.
    The tractor manufacturing industry has increased the output of tractors by 33%, especially the output of wheeled tractors. The production of three new types of tractors has now begun, and seven types of tractors have been improved to make them more perfect.
    Due to the rapid increase in agriculture, the production of agricultural machinery in 1958 increased by 82% compared with 1955. The output of suspended agricultural machinery has also greatly increased, such as tractor-drawn plows, cultivators, harvesters, etc.
          Building Materials Industry
    The building materials industry has developed particularly rapidly. In the past three years, the production of building materials has increased by approximately 70%. The production of materials and finished products that ensure high assembly, improve construction quality, and reduce costs has also been greatly developed.
    In essence, the large factory enterprises of prefabricated reinforced concrete have been re-established, and prefabricated reinforced concrete is the foundation of modern industrial construction. The output of reinforced concrete structures and parts in 1958 is approximately 17 million cubic meters, exceeding 2.2 times that of 1955 and 12 times that of 1950.
    In industrial and residential construction, we have widely adopted prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and parts throughout the country.
    In the past three years, cement production has increased to 1.5 times, and will reach 33.5 million tons in 1958. The Soviet Union ranks first in Europe in cement production, second only to the United States.
    The production of asbestos-cement board, a roofing material with high economic value, has been greatly developed. This is driven by the large amount of natural asbestos resources and the rapid development of the cement industry. The production volume of asbestos-cement board has increased by almost one billion pieces compared with 1955, and the production volume of asbestos-cement board will reach 2.4 billion pieces in 1958. The Soviet Union's asbestos-cement board production exceeds the total production of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.
    The production of other building materials has also been greatly developed. For example, this year's production of window glass, soft roofing boards, heating radiators, asbestos-cement pipes, mineral wool, and mineral wool products will increase by 25%-50% compared with 1955. The production of huge concrete and silicate walls, dry gypsum slurry, ceramic products, and other building materials has also been greatly developed.
    One of the important achievements of the growth of Soviet industry is the great development of automated production.
    In 1957, approximately 90% of Soviet steel production was produced by mechanized and automated furnaces. More than 80% of the electricity produced by the thermal power stations in various regions is produced by thermal power stations equipped with boiler combined units with automatic adjustment devices. All hydroelectric power stations in all regions are fully automated. Remote control has also been widely adopted in the power industry.
    Automated production is being used more and more widely in the machine manufacturing industry. More than 60% of tractor and agricultural machinery manufacturing has adopted automatic operation lines.
    Recently, the production of tools and instruments using automated control and manipulation process regulations has increased to two times, and the production of mathematical computers has increased to three times.
    Instruments and devices controlled by gas and electricity have been put into mass production.
    All of these make it possible to realize comprehensive automation of a series of process regulations in some industrial departments, such as machine manufacturing, the chemical industry, the metallurgical industry, and other industrial departments.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government constantly care about improving the lives and working conditions of the working people. With the further development of mechanization and automation to reduce workers' labor, huge measures to shorten working hours can be taken.
    At present, a six-hour and seven-hour workday for workers and staff is being implemented in the coal and metallurgical industry departments. Working hours for workers and staff are also being shortened in many other heavy industry departments. Therefore, most workers have increased wage quotas.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government are very concerned about improving the material welfare, living conditions, and cultural and living facilities of the working people. The actual income of workers—including free education, free medical care, national pensions, and other payments and preferential treatment, as well as shortening the workday—has increased fourfold compared with before the revolution.
            Light Industry
    On the basis of the vigorous development of heavy industry, the production of daily necessities such as cloth, clothes, shoes, and food has also been greatly developed. This year, the Soviet Union's production of daily necessities will increase to twenty times that of 1917.
    The scale of residential construction is also very large. In the two years of 1956 and 1957, excluding the residential construction of collective farms, the total area of residential buildings completed was 88 million square meters. The plan for 1958 stipulates that the total area of residential buildings to be built is 62 million square meters, while it will be 100 million square meters in 1960. We can confidently say that the task of eliminating housing shortages in the next ten to twelve years, formulated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, will be completed ahead of schedule.
    On the basis of technological progress, the adoption of new technologies and advanced working methods, and the improvement of production organization, workers' labor productivity increases year by year. Under the conditions of shortening the workday, my country's industrial labor productivity in 1958 increased by 21% compared with 1955.
    In 1957, the average annual labor productivity of Soviet industrial workers, under the conditions of shortened working hours, increased by eight and a half times compared with 1913. During the same period, US industrial labor productivity only increased by 1.3 times, the UK only increased by 40%, and France increased by one time. The Soviet Union has exceeded the labor productivity level of the United Kingdom and France, and has greatly shortened the distance with the United States in terms of labor productivity level.
    Socialist competition, mass creative innovation, and rationalization proposals have played a decisive role in the development of the socialist economy. My country's socialist competition is of a national character. At present, the competition to celebrate the upcoming 21st Congress of the CPSU is unfolding more and more widely. While participating in the socialist competition to celebrate the upcoming 21st Congress of the CPSU, the entire staff of factories and mines guarantee to complete the 1958 product production plan ahead of schedule, improve product quality, and reduce production costs.
    Due to the initiative of the Donbass miners, a competition has been widely carried out in various industrial departments for each worker to overfulfill the daily production quota and reduce the cost of producing each unit of product.
    The general plan for the Soviet Union's development of the national economy shows the Soviet people a magnificent prospect. Within fifteen years, the Soviet Union will not only catch up with but also exceed the current production volume of major products in the United States. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have set the task: during the three five-year plans, steel production should reach 100 million to 120 million tons, iron production—75 million to 85 million tons, coal production—650 million to 750 million tons, oil production—350 million to 400 million tons, and electricity generation—800 billion to 900 billion kilowatt-hours. There is no doubt that this task will be successfully completed.
    The People's Republic of China and other countries in the socialist camp have also made great contributions to the cause of the socialist world system victoriously launching peaceful competition with the capitalist system. In recent years, the national economies of these countries have greatly advanced, and their development speed has significantly exceeded that of capitalist countries.

    苏联工业在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后的发展和成就
    苏联部长会议副主席　扎霞迪科
    1956年2月召开的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会制定进一步发展共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。
    在共产党的领导下，把第二十次代表大会的历史性决议付诸实施的苏联人民，用他们在发展经济和文化、在进一步改善苏联人的物质福利方面所获得的新的巨大成就，来迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年。他们向人类的光辉未来——共产主义的道路迈进了新的巨大的一步。
        工业生产的发展
    苏联的经济发展的特点就是工业生产不断的迅速增长。1957年的工业总产量比苏共第二十次代表大会以前1955年增长了22％。1958年的九个月中的工业产量比1957年同期增长了10％。1958年出产的工业品大约将五十倍于1917年。这就是说，苏联现在每七天生产的工业品相当于1917年的全年产量。
    我们的国家在最短的历史期间成为了世界工业最发达的国家。在工业产量上，我们已远远超过了欧洲的资本主义国家，并满怀信心地赶上美国。
    苏联工业发展的速度是资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。在社会主义经济制度的这一优越性中，便体现出社会主义在经济竞赛中必将战胜资本主义的事实。从1918年到1957年，苏联的工业生产平均每年增加10.1％，同期内在美国工业生产每年平均仅增加3.2％。同时，在和平经济建设的年代，社会主义经济发展速度的优越性更加显著。例如，从1930年到1940年这战前十一年中和1947年到1957年这战后十一年中，苏联工业增长额的每年平均速度为16.2％，而美国仅只为2.7％。
    十分重要的是：最近几年来苏联不仅在增长速度方面超过美国，而且在产品绝对增产额方面也超过了美国。例如，从1953年到1957年，苏联的铁的绝对增产额，平均每年为二百四十万吨，而美国为八十万吨，苏联的钢为三百三十万吨，美国为三十万吨，苏联的水泥为三百二十万吨，而美国为一百二十万吨，苏联的石油为一千一百四十万吨，而美国为八百八十万吨，苏联的煤（折合成硬煤）为三千零八十万吨，而美国为六百二十万吨。
    在美国，1958年头七个月的工业生产总额减少了10.2％，钢产量减少了36.5％。1958年上半年，美国的铁产量减少了38.3％，煤的开采量减少了22％，石油开采量减少了14％。在其他资本主义国家里，也发生了工业生产下降的现象。
    列宁关于优先发展重工业的学说，是苏联整个国民经济的基础，是进一步巩固国家的威力和不断提高苏联人民物质福利的基础。由于一贯遵循着列宁的这一学说，苏联才获得了工业发展中的巨大成就。
    仅只在1956年和1957年两年中，也就是说在苏共第二十次代表大会后的头两年之间，苏联的生产资料的生产扩大了24％。1958年与1917年相比，重工业的生产量约增加到一百倍。
    由于实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议，在最近三年来显著地加强了采用新的生产设备，改善了对现有的生产设备的使用，加快了制造和使用新机器的工作，不断地从技术上来改善生产，并在这个基础上，以及在进一步发展社会主义竞赛的基础上，劳动生产率一年比一年提高了，所有这些对于发展苏联工业都具有决定性的意义。
    由苏联共产党中央委员会倡议，得到全体苏联人民热烈拥护的工业和建筑管理的改组，对于苏联工业的工作产生了特别良好的影响，工业和建筑管理改组保证了列宁的民主集中制原则的进一步发展，促进了广大的劳动人民在管理生产、探求和使用生产潜力方面的积极性的提高。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后，最重要的重工业部的发展特点如下：
          黑色冶金工业
    黑色冶金工业获得的成就最大。在1958年，苏联约生产四千万吨铁，五千五百万吨钢和四千三百万吨钢材，与苏联共产党第二十次代表大会前夕，即与1955年相比，生铁和钢增加了20％，钢材增加了21％。与1913年相比，这些对于国民经济最重要的产品的生产总额相应地增加到九点四倍、十三倍和十二倍。仅只一个马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂生产的生铁、钢和钢材，就超过了我国在1913年全年的生产量。
    苏联的黑色金属生产的规模占欧洲第一位，在全世界仅次于美国位居第二位。1957年苏联炼的钢比英国、法国和比利时的总和还要多。仅苏维埃政权年代兴建的四个钢铁厂——马格尼托哥尔斯克、库兹涅茨、下塔吉尔和萨波罗什炼出的铁和钢，就比法国多。
    黑色金属生产之所以获得迅速增长，一方面是由于增添了新的生产能力，一方面是由于改善了冶金联合机组的工作，这是通过合并主要联合机组和改善其构造、生产的机械化和自动化、改善劳动组织和为炼钢准备原料和燃料的工作、采用先进技术规程和各种新式原料而达到的。
    最近，苏联正在优先建造巨大的机械化和自动化的高炉，其容积为一千四百至一千七百立方公尺。
    1957年对高炉的利用比1950年增加了19％，比1940年增加了33.5％，平炉相应地增加了30％和65％。所以获得这些成就是由于在高炉生产中加强了技术规程的缘故，例如，提高炉顶煤气的压力，提高鼓风的温度、采用自溶烧结矿、天然煤气和综合自动化，在炼钢方面则使用氧气、加强炉子的温度和采用主要的耐火材料。
    苏联对于高炉和平炉的利用达到了世界最高峰。
    例如，在马格尼托哥尔斯克和库兹涅茨炼钢厂以及其他炼钢厂等先进的企业，对高炉和平炉的利用，比苏联全国平均数高出15％—20％。
            采煤工业
    采煤工业在苏联经济中占有重要的地位。
    今年我国开采的煤比1913年增加了十六倍，约为四亿九千六百万吨，也就是比1955年多一亿零五百万吨。因而，在最近三年来煤产量的增长额为1913年全年的开采量的三点六倍。
    苏联的煤产量大大超过了欧洲各资本主义国家，今年我们所开采的煤将超过美国。
    在这一点上可以明显地看出苏联矿工在建设煤炭工业的威力强大的生产技术基地，在不断发展煤炭工业技术方面巨大的创造性劳动。
    最近几年来，采煤工业的机械化显著地扩大了。采煤工作面装煤的机械化水平从1955年的33％增加到1958年上半年的39.5％，在准备巷道的掘进时，装煤和岩石工作的机械化从47％增到54％。
    在顿涅茨、库兹涅茨和卡拉干达矿区，用传送带装煤机械化的程度达到45％—70％，在准备工作面装煤和岩石的机械化程度达到68％—70％。在回采工作面和准备工作面已大量地采用金属支架，机械化的支架、浅截式采煤联合机和不用拆卸的运输机已开始使用了。
    在改善坑道体系和在回采区和矿田采用后退式回采方面，进行了巨大的工作。
    不断扩大采用最经济的露天采煤方法具有重大的意义。1958年，有九千六百万吨煤将使用这种方法开采，这个吨数为1955年的一点五倍，为战前1940年的十五倍。
    在采煤工业方面，已开始大规模地使用效率高的水力采煤的方法，同时也在不断地扩大采用其他采煤的合合理方法。
        石油和煤气工业
    石油工业和煤气工业也在以全速前进。1958年开采的石油达到一亿一千三百万吨，也就是比1955年增加了60％。在这一期间，天然煤气和伴生煤气增加到三倍，几乎达到二百九十亿立方公尺。石油的开采和加工的技术也在不断改进。由于采用了新的强大的钻孔机床、电钻，以及改善了劳动组织，一部石油和煤气钻井每月的掘进速度，在1956年—1958年间，在钻生产井方面增长了约20％，在钻探井方面增加了36％。
    最近几年来，广泛地采用了水力切断岩层的方法，其目的是为了扩大钻井的流量。在开采石油矿方面，大大增加了对边缘内注水和边缘外注水方法的采用，这可以使采矿方面大量节约，还可以更充分地提取石油。
    炼油厂安装上新的、威力更强大的技术装置、炼油厂生产的综合自动化和机械化，显著地扩大了炼油量，并降低了炼油厂的建造成本。
    为了在炼油方面进一步加速扩大新设备，现在正在准备制造每年生产能力为六百万吨的真空蒸馏装置；每年生产能力为二百至二百五十万吨的催化裂化装置；威力强大的催化重整装置和生产润滑油的巨大装置。
    石油化学产品的生产越来越广泛地发展起来了；例如，合成酒精、合成脂肪酸、酒精和其他。
    现在正在用优先发展最经济的各种燃料，即石油和煤气的方法来进一步发展苏联国民经济的燃料基地。
    这可以达到大量节省社会劳动，并能大大有助于国民经济发展速度的加快。
    因此，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府规定了在最近十五年内使煤气的产量每年达到二千七百亿至三千二百亿立方公尺，也就是说为1957年开采和生产的煤气的总量十三倍到十五倍。这可以保证根本改变我们燃料的平衡结构，大量削减煤的比重而代之以更经济的各种石油燃料和天燃煤气。这种大规模的改变在最近的几年就可以实现。
            电力工业
    在苏联国民经济电气化的发展方面也获得了显著的成就。近三年内电力的生产增加了36％，1958年将达到二千三百亿度，同时，水电站所产电力几乎增加了一倍。这可以改善对工业和城市的电力供应，以及大规模地发展铁路运输电气化的工作。
    转为建设巨大的发电站大大地促进了电气化的进一步发展，这可以降低电力的成本和所安装的设备能力的单位的投资额。
    除了早已建成的巨大水电站外，世界上最大的以列宁命名的伏尔加水电站已全部发电了，它的发电能力为二百三十万瓩。发电能力为二百三十万瓩的斯大林格勒的水电站（这座水电站的第一批联合机组将在1958年开始发电），发电能力为三百六十万瓩的布拉次克水电站和其他水电站的建设工程，均已大力展开。此外，还开始建设许多发电能力从一百万到两百万瓩不等的火力发电站。
    为了在短期内只花费少量的钱而能大大提高发电站的能力，从而加速电气化的速度和赢得时间，在最近几年内将优先建造使用便宜的露天开采的煤和天然煤气的火力发电站。
    动力技术的水平也显著地提高了，正在建筑的发电站能力和已经开动的联合机组的单位生产能力已经提高了。现在，在各地区的发电站上已分别安装上发电能力为五万、十万、十五万的威力强大的涡轮发电机。正在安装第一部发电能力为二十万瓩的联合机组在各地区的火力发电站上，已安装好的高压联合机组的比重，约为60％，而过去只有20％。
    原子能动力工业也得到了进一步的发展。现在正在建设几个规模巨大的原子能发电站。其中的一个发电站的第一期工程，今年已经竣工并开始发电，发电能力为十万瓩。
    最近几年内架设了一些四百千伏的高压输电线，并开始架设五百千伏的线路，这为建立国内统一的动力系统奠定了基础。
              化学工业
    化学工业发展的速度也很快，今年的产量将比1955年提高40％。目前，化学工业三天之内生产的产品，比革命前的俄国1913年整年的产量还多。
    最近三年之内，矿物肥料的生产增加了27％，其中氮肥增加了36.5％。同时，为农业组织了大规模的农药生产。
    硫酸的生产增加了27％，其中利用已用过的二氧化硫生产的硫酸提高到一点五倍。
    从原油中提炼酒精的生产得到了特别迅速的发展，这有极大的经济意义。1958年人造酒精的产量将比1955年几乎增加四倍。这样，在工业需要中就可以代替用粮食提炼的大量酒精，从中可以节约一亿普特的粮食。
    在这个时期内，也大规模地组织了利用废瓦斯生产氨气。塑料和合成树脂的生产、人造纤维和合成纤维的生产已提高到一倍半，这就大大促使日用品产量的增加，并有可能用较便宜的材料来代替大量的有色金属。
    在苏共第二十次代表大会后的几年内，建立了新的化学工业部门——有机矽合成物，并为电力工业和无线电工业生产优质有机矽漆。
    合成橡胶的生产扩大了。掌握了许多合成橡胶的新品种。用合成乙醇制造橡胶的生产提高了一倍。
    由于科学研究的结果在生产中广泛采用了塑料、橡胶和胶片做的大量新材料和制品。制造了为放射人造地球卫星所必需的火箭技术用的材料。
    目前，为实现苏共中央五月全会关于加速化学工业的发展、特别是加速生产合成材料的决议，广泛地开展了各项工作，这项决议规定：1965年底人造纤维和合成纤维的生产能力将比1957年提高到四点六倍，塑料和合成树脂提高到八倍，合成橡胶提高到三点四倍。
          机器制造工业
    作为整个国民经济中技术进步的基础的机器制造业，也取得了出色的成就。在机器制造业各个部门生产提高的同时，也大大提高了机器的技术完善程度。工厂能生产大量技术先进的新机器。
    足够说明这一点的是，最近三年来共制造出四千五百多种重要的、新型的机器、机械、仪器和其他设备。
    在重型机器制造业方面，特别提高了动力工业和冶金工业设备的生产量。蒸汽涡轮机的产量增加了33％，煤气涡轮机增加到七点五倍。涡轮机的生产是根据提高它的单位能力和在蒸汽涡轮机上采用蒸汽高参数的原则而发展的。已经制造出二十万瓩的蒸汽涡轮机、十万五千瓩的水力涡轮机，正在准备生产二十万瓩的水力涡轮机和拟制五万瓩的煤气涡轮机。
    高炉设备的生产增加到一点六倍。正在准备生产许多设计先进的快速薄板机和其他轧钢机，其中有世界上最大的薄板机，它的年产量是三百五十万吨。
    为挖掘工作制造了一次能挖土二十五立方公尺和臂长一百公尺的走动挖土机，正在设计一次挖土三十五立方公尺的挖土机。
    自动和半自动车床、自动锻压机的制造，提高到二倍以上，车床的自动传送带的制造提高到一倍半。
    由于铁路运输改用更新的、先进的牵引工具，大马力的内燃机车和电气机车的生产也有了很大的提高。正在拟制和准备生产一千一百马力、七百五十马力、四百马力和一百五十马力的各种调车内燃机车。蒸汽机车现在已不再制造了。
    为土木工程和筑路工程的机械化而生产的机器的品种也增加了很多，仅仅1956年和1957年内提交制造的新机器就有一百五十九种。
    在电力工业方面已经开始成批生产大量新式的电力设备，其中有四百千伏的高压电装置。已经制成了第一部用增高压力的氢来冷却转子线卷的二十万瓩的涡轮发电机。目前正在拟制大批新的电动机和发电机。
    在汽车制造工业方面，在提高产量的同时，生产了许多新的现代化式样的小轿车和大汽车来代替大量过时的旧式汽车。目前出产十二种新型的载重货车、四种小轿车和五种大汽车。
    拖拉机制造工业提高了拖拉机的产量33％，特别是提高了轮式拖拉机的产量。现在已开始生产三种新式的拖拉机，改进了七种拖拉机，使它们更臻完善。
    由于农业的迅速提高，1958年农业机器的生产比1955年提高了82％。吊挂式的农业机器的产量也有了很大提高，如：拖拉机牵引犁、中耘机、收割机等。
          建筑材料工业
    建筑材料工业有了特别迅速的发展。最近三年内建筑材料的生产提高约达70％。保证高度装配，提高建筑质量和降低成本的材料和成品的生产，也得到了很大的发展。
    实质上重新建立了装配式钢筋混凝土的大工厂企业，装配式钢筋混凝土是现代化工业建筑的基础。1958年钢筋混凝土结构和零件的产量约一千七百万立方公尺，超过1955年的二点二倍和1950年的十二倍。
    在工业和住宅建筑方面，我们全国已经广泛地采用了装配式钢筋混凝土结构和零件。
    最近三年来，水泥的生产提高到一点五倍，1958年将达到三千三百五十万吨。苏联在水泥生产方面占欧洲第一位，仅次于美国。
    有高度经济价值的屋顶用的材料——石棉水泥板的生产得到很大的发展。这是大量的自然石棉资源和水泥工业的迅速发展所促成的。石棉水泥板生产量几乎比1955年增加了十亿块，1958年石棉水泥板生产量将达到二十四亿块。苏联石棉水泥板的产量超过了美、英、法三国产量的总和。
    其它建筑材料的生产也得到很大的发展。例如，今年的窗玻璃、软屋顶板、暖气包、石棉水泥管、矿质棉和矿质棉制成品的产量，将比1955年增加25％—50％。巨大的混凝土和硅酸盐墙、干石膏浆、陶器制品和其它建筑材料的生产也得到很大的发展。
    苏联工业增长的重要成果之一是自动化生产的大大发展。
    1957年苏联的钢铁生产大约有90％是由机械化和自动化的炉子炼出的。各区火力发电站生产的电力，有80％以上是在安装有自动化调整装置锅炉联合机的火力发电站生产的。所有区的水力发电站全部都是自动化的。在动力工业上还广泛采用了远距离操纵。
    机器制造业越来越广泛地采用自动化生产。在拖拉机和农业机器制造业中有60％以上采用了自动作业线。
    最近，用自动化控制和操纵工艺规程的工具仪器生产增长到二倍，数学计算机的生产增长到三倍。
    利用气体和电力控制的仪器和装置已大批投入生产。
    所有这些使一些工业部门，如机器制造业、化学工业、冶金工业和其它工业部门中一系列的工艺规程有可能实现综合自动化。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府不断地关心劳动人民的生活和劳动条件的改善。随着减轻工人劳动的机械化和自动化进一步的发展，便可采取缩短工作时间的巨大措施。
    现在，在煤炭和冶金工业部门已在实行工人和职员的六小时和七小时的工作日。在其它很多重工业部门也在缩短工人和职员的工作时间。因此大部分工人都提高了工资定额。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府十分关心改善劳动人民物质福利、居住条件和文化生活设施。工人的实际收入——包括免费学习、公费医疗、国家抚恤金和其它的支付和优待，也包括缩短工作日——比革命前增加了四倍。
            轻工业
    在重工业蓬勃发展的基础上，布匹、衣服、鞋子、食品等日用品的生产，也获得很大的发展。今年苏联的日用品生产将比1917年增加到二十倍。
    住宅建筑的规模也很大。在1956年和1957年二年中，不包括集体农庄的住宅建筑，建成的住宅总面积为八千八百万平方公尺，1958年计划规定建造的住宅总面积为六千二百万平方公尺，而1960年将为一亿平方公尺。我们可以肯定地说，由苏联共产党和苏联政府所制定的在最近十年到十二年时间内消灭住房不足的任务，将提前完成。
    在技术进步、采用新技术和先进工作方法，以及改善生产组织的基础上，工人的劳动生产率一年比一年提高。在缩短工作日的条件下，1958年我国工业劳动生产率比1955年提高21％。
    1957年，苏联工业工人平均一年的劳动生产率，在缩短工作时间的条件下，比1913年提高了八倍半。在同一时期内，美国工业劳动生产率只提高了一点三倍，英国仅提高了40％，法国提高了一倍。苏联超过了英国和法国的劳动生产率水平，大大缩短了与美国在劳动生产率水平方面的距离。
    社会主义竞赛、群众性的创造革新和合理化建议，在社会主义经济发展中起了决定性的作用。我国社会主义竞赛带有全民性质。目前，为庆祝即将召开的苏共第二十一次党代表大会的竞赛，正在越来越广泛地展开了。在参加为庆祝即将召开的苏共第二十一次党代表大会的社会主义竞赛的同时，厂矿企业全体人员保证提前完成1958年的产品生产计划，提高产品质量和降低生产成本。
    由于顿巴斯矿工们的倡议，在各个工业部门广泛开展了每个工人为超额完成每天的生产定额和减少生产每一单位产品的费用的竞赛。
    苏联发展国民经济的总计划在苏联人民面前展示了宏伟的远景。十五年内苏联不仅能赶上，而且将超过美国目前主要产品的生产量。苏联共产党和苏联政府提出这样的任务：在三个五年计划期间，钢产量要达到一亿到一亿二千万吨，铁产量——七千五百万到八千五百万吨，煤产量——六亿五千万到七亿五千万吨，石油产量——三亿五千万到四亿吨，发电量——八千亿到九千亿度。毫无疑问，这个任务将胜利完成。
    中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营的其他国家，在社会主义的世界体系与资本主义制度胜利展开和平竞赛的事业中，也作出了很大的贡献，最近几年来这些国家的国民经济大大向前推进了，其发展速度显著地超过了资本主义国家。
