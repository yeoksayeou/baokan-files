    Outstanding Soil Expert Gan Zhijin
    Identifies Soil Fertility and Properties Based on Plant and Animal Growth
    (Our Dispatch) Gan Zhijin, an old farmer from Hongqi Commune, Xinxing County, Guangdong Province, can identify soil fertility and properties by observing the growth of plants and animals. Recently, at the National Soil Survey Work On-site Conference held in Xinxing County, he was invited to give a special report.
    This sixty-four-year-old soil expert told soil scientists from all over the country that the fertility of the soil is different, and the small animals and weeds that grow in the soil are also different. He cited: paddy fields where mole crickets, earthworms, snails, and forage grass like to grow must be fertile fields; places where leeches and cat hair grass (leaves are needle-shaped, with particularly developed root systems, a grass that even cattle are unwilling to eat) grow are strongly acidic, rusty water paddy fields or yellow mud paddy fields. If the number of the same species of organisms found in different cultivated land is similar, it can be judged that these types of fields are similar.
    Why do different soils grow different animals and plants? Gan Zhijin explained in detail that this is because the environmental conditions required for animal and plant survival are different, such as soil temperature, humidity, viscosity, looseness, and hardness, which determine the distribution of organisms. He compared fertile fields with a sand-to-mud ratio of 3:7 to yellow soil-bonded fields. The former has loose soil and more organic matter, with more larvae. The latter has sticky and hard soil and less organic matter, with fewer larvae. Therefore, animals such as mole crickets, earthworms, and snails can easily find food and burrow into the soil for self-defense in the former, while the latter is not conducive to the survival of these animals. Gan Zhijin also discussed the role of soil animals on crops dialectically. He cited as an example that mole crickets, while searching for food in rice fields, damage the root systems of crops, but loosening the soil and excreting fertilizer helps deepen the arable layer, which is beneficial to crop growth. Earlier this year, technicians who came to Xinxing County to conduct a soil survey dug profiles of the soil quality judged by Gan Zhijin for chemical analysis, proving that his judgment was completely correct.

    出色的土壤土专家甘志锦
    根据动植物生长鉴别土壤肥力、性质
    本报讯　广东省新兴县红旗公社老农甘志锦能通过观察动植物生长情况鉴别土壤肥力和性质。最近在新兴县举行的全国土壤普查工作现场会议，邀请他作了专题报告。
    这位六十四岁的土专家向来自全国各地的土壤科学工作者说，土壤的肥力不同，生长在土壤中的小动物和野草也各有差别。他举出：土狗（蝼蛄）、蚯蚓、田螺、饲料草等喜爱生长的田土，肯定是肥田；蚂蝗（水蛭）、猫毛草（叶呈针状，根群特别发达，牛也不愿吃的一种草）等生长的地方，都是强酸性的铁锈水田或黄泥田。在不同耕地里发现同种生物的数量相近，便可以判断这些田土类型相似。
    为什么不同土壤会生长不同的动物植物？甘志锦详尽地解释说这是由于动物植物生存依赖的环境条件要求不同，如土壤温度、湿度、粘性、松软和硬实等，决定了生物的分布。他以沙三泥七的肥沃田与黄土粘结田作对比。前者泥土松软，有机质多，幼虫多。后者泥土粘结硬实，有机质少，幼虫少。因此，蝼蛄、蚯蚓、田螺等动物在前者既容易找到食物，也容易钻进土层自卫，而后者对这些动物生存却不利。甘志锦还辩证地论述了土壤动物对农作物的作用。他举例说，蝼蛄在水稻田里寻找食物，破坏了作物根群，但掘松土壤和排泄出肥料，却帮助了耕作层加深而有利作物生长。今年初，到新兴县作土壤普查的技术人员，对甘志锦所判断的土质挖剖面作化学分析，证明他的判断完全正确。　（郑世文）
