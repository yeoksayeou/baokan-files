    Heroes of Luzhai
    Our correspondent in Nanning
    After getting off the Xiang-Gui Railway at Luzhai Station, you can immediately see a huge banner stretched across Changgu Ridge opposite: "Steel boils, iron flows, Britain admits defeat, America bows its head." To the north of Changgu Ridge are the encampments of the Dayang, Zhongdu, Yingshan, and Xiangshui iron and steel bases. During the day, the mountains and plains are filled with the sounds of folk songs, axes, mine blasts, wheel rolling, and propaganda broadcasts. At night, fires blaze everywhere; gas lamps, kerosene lamps, torches, and flashlights form strings and patches, with thousands of people fighting harder and harder. It is truly beautiful and magnificent.

        The Flying Tiger Battalion's Great Battle at the Forty-Eight Hollows?
    There are forty-eight hollows on Changgu Ridge. Weeds and shrubs grow everywhere. Before liberation, it was a lair for wild animals and bandits. Now, the Flying Tiger Battalion of Liujiang County, with 1,215 soldiers stationed at the foot of the mountain, transformed fifteen mountain hollows into charcoal bases in less than half a month. Wei Shaoqun of the Hero Commune had burned charcoal for more than ten years. He thought that when he came to the construction site, he would be guarding the stove day and night, pulling the bellows, or holding the red-hot iron back and forth. Who knew that this time he would be assigned to burn charcoal again? So, he kept thinking: I used to burn charcoal, and now I still burn charcoal; what does burning charcoal have to do with steel production? Soon, the construction site opened an amateur Red and Expert School. Through discussions and debates at the school, he and other soldiers realized that logging and burning charcoal are important parts of steelmaking. People's ideological awareness improved, and their enthusiasm was like a volcanic eruption. The more than 600 soldiers from the Hero Commune who joined the Flying Tiger Battalion brought only 62 knives and axes. Many who did not get knives and axes climbed on the hillside to tear at the trees with their hands and split them with broken hoes. Without sharp tools to dig charcoal kilns, they used pointed wooden sticks to pry the soil. Although many people's palms and soles were blistered, no one felt tired. Listen! The east mountain sings: "No need for knives to cut firewood on the mountain, just kick with your feet and shake with your hands; if you don't believe me, come and see, one person does the work of ten." In a moment, the west mountain sings: "All soldiers act quickly, surpassing Wukong making havoc in heaven; as long as everyone works hard, satellites going to space are guaranteed." In this way, in just ten days, firewood was piled all over the hollows and charcoal kilns were everywhere. In the past, it took eight days to burn a kiln of charcoal, gradually shortened to five days, three days, and finally only 17 hours.

          Giving Up Homes for Ore
    Where there is ore, where there is fuel, that is where iron is smelted. This is an experience from the great battle for iron and steel in Luzhai. However, this is not a simple matter. The Six-End Village of Yingshan People's Commune is full of high-grade rich ore above and below ground. Should they choose ore or houses? Would it work to give up houses to mine ore? Just last year, villagers were fighting to withdraw from the agricultural cooperative over a few dozen yellow-skinned fruit trees, but today is different. After an hour of discussion at a mobilization meeting, the commune members of Six-End Village unanimously said: Move! On the morning of the 17th, they removed the roofs and moved to Guanqiao, Duzhai and other villages. That day, people mined on the spot, using the walls of the original houses to make nine large earthen kilns, loaded with ore and fuel, and set them on fire to smelt iron. On the night of the 20th, the first kiln of iron was produced on the site of Lu Chunhua's three houses. This kiln contained a total of 6,600 tons of ore, yielding more than 2,000 tons of iron and more than 2,000 tons of sintered iron. People wrote the words "House Iron" on drums and gongs and inserted them into the iron pile. Lu Chunhua said with a smile: "I am busy for the great battle for iron and steel, and my house has also contributed to the great battle for iron and steel!"

          Large Earthen Kilns and "Small Native Clusters"
    On the eight iron and steel bases in the county, the most attractive are not only the clusters of small native blast furnaces, but also the large earthen kilns that have never been seen in the history of ironmaking. Most of these large earthen kilns are lime kiln-style furnaces, but there are also those that use old houses, bunkers, and pillboxes for ironmaking, and others that use mine pits, valleys, and channels to build kilns. In short, everything that can be used to burn kilns has been armed by the masses. Most of the more than 8,000 newly built ironmaking kilns in the county are this type of large earthen kiln, with an average capacity of 50 tons per kiln. When the command issued the order: foreign furnaces, native furnaces, blast furnaces, low furnaces, large kilns, small kilns are all lit at the same time, all smoking. In an instant, it was truly red and hot everywhere. There is a valley-style large kiln in the Forty-Eight Peaks, with mountain rocks on both sides of the kiln body, and kiln walls built on the front and rear ends, with ventilation holes in the middle and iron and slag outlets below. When loading materials, it takes in more than 30,000 tons of ore and wood at a time. It spits out more than 9,000 tons of pig iron and sintered iron at once, which is more than hundreds of small native blast furnaces produce. A new mine pit kiln that appeared on the Xiangshui construction site covers an area of ​​nearly one acre and is about three zhang deep. There are net-shaped fire channels and fire holes under the pit, and six chimneys above. It is filled with 50,000 tons of ore alone, and can produce 30,000 tons of iron and sintered iron at a time. The soldiers call it the "No. 1 Kiln in the World" and pasted a couplet on both sides, the first line reads: An earthen kiln floods England with molten iron, and the second line reads: Satellites are launched and thick smoke covers the American sky. The people's ambition to dare to think, dare to act, and strive to be the best in the world, truly changes the wind and clouds and breaks the mountains and rivers.

    The iron and steel fighters have developed a deep affection for the tense and happy construction site life. Wei Chunxiu, a member of the Hero Commune in Liujiang County, said with deep affection, where in the world can you find such a joyous and lively amusement park! He is willing to bring his wife and children to live on the construction site for the rest of his life. (Attached picture)

    鹿寨英雄
    本报驻南宁记者
    在湘桂铁路鹿寨车站下车后，举目便可看到对面长古岭上，横排着一幅巨大的标语：“钢水沸腾，铁水奔流，英国服输，美国低头。”在长古岭的北面，是大阳、中渡、英山、响水等钢铁基地的营盘。白天，满山遍野都激荡着山歌声、刀斧声、矿坑爆破声、车轮辗轧声和广播鼓动声；一到夜间，到处火光熊熊，汽灯、马灯、火把、手电，成串连片，千人万马越战越酣，真是美丽而壮观。
        飞虎营大战四十八?
    长古岭上有个四十八?。荒草杂木，漫山遍野。解放前曾是野兽、土匪潜伏的巢穴。现在，柳江县飞虎营，一千二百一十五名战士扎营山下，不到半月就把十五个山?改变成为柴炭基地。英雄公社的韦绍群曾经烧过十多年炭，他以为到工地上一定是日夜守在炉旁拉风箱，要不就是握着虎头钳，噙着通红的铁块来回奔忙。谁料这次恰好又分配他烧炭，于是，他心里总在打转：过去烧炭，现在还烧炭；烧炭算什么钢铁生产？不久，工地上开办了业余红专学校，他和其他战士在学校里通过鸣放辩论，才认识到伐木烧炭是炼钢铁重要的一环。人们的思想觉悟提高了，干劲就像火山爆发一样，英雄公社参加飞虎营的六百多名战士，一共只带六十二把刀斧，许多没有分到刀斧的，就爬在山坡上用手扯；用破锄头劈；挖炭窑没有利器，就用尖木头撬土，许多人的手心和脚掌虽然磨出了血泡，但谁也不感到劳累。听吧！东山上唱道：“上山砍柴不用刀，全凭脚踢手来摇；不信你来跟我看，一人干来十人挑。”一会儿西边山上唱道：“全体战士急行动，赛过悟空闹天宫；只要大家拼命干，卫星上天有保证。”就是这样，只用十来天功夫，便闹得柴草满?，炭窑遍地。过去烧一窑炭需要八天，逐步缩短到五天、三天，最后只用17小时。
          舍掉家园取矿石
    哪里有矿石，哪里有燃料，就在哪里炼铁，这是鹿寨钢铁大战中的一条经验。但是，这并不是一件简单的事儿。英山人民公社六末村，地上地下全是品位很高的富矿。要矿呢还是要房屋？舍掉房屋挖矿石能行得通吗？就在去年，村里的社员为了几十株黄皮果树，还闹着要退出农业社，但是，今天却不同了。六末村的公社社员们，在一次动员会上，只经过一小时的商讨，便异口同声地说：搬！17日清晨，他们就把屋顶掀掉，分别迁移到官桥，独寨等村居住。当日，人们就地挖矿，利用原有房屋墙壁，做成九个大土窑，装上矿石和燃料，点火炼铁。20日夜晚，在卢春华的三间房屋基地上出了头一窑铁。这一窑共装六千六百吨矿石，出铁两千多吨，另有烧结铁两千多吨。人们敲锣打鼓写着“房子铁”三字插在铁堆上。卢春华笑眯眯地说：“我为钢铁大战奔忙，我的房屋也为钢铁大战出了力！”
          大土窑和“小土群”
    在全县八个钢铁基地上，最吸引人的不仅有成群的小土高炉，还出现了一片一片的在过去炼铁史上没有见过的大土窑。这些大土窑中绝大多数是石灰窑式的窑炉，也有把旧房屋、碉堡、炮楼加以改造利用炼铁的，还有利用矿坑、山谷和渠道来筑窑炉。总而言之，凡是能利用来烧窑的东西，都被群众武装起来了。全县新建的八千多个炼铁窑，大部是这种大土窑，平均每个窑的容量是五十吨。当指挥部发出号令：洋炉、土炉、高炉、低炉、大窑、小窑一齐点火，统统冒烟。霎时间，真是到处红通通，遍地热烘烘。四十八峰有个山谷式大窑，窑身两边全是山岩，前后两端砌起窑壁，中段通风孔，下留出铁口和出渣口。装料时，一次就吃下三万来吨矿石和木柴。一下就吐出九千多吨生铁和烧结铁，比几百个小土高炉出的还多。响水工地上新出现的一座矿坑大窑，面积将近一亩大，深约三丈，坑下设有网形火道和烧火口，上有六个烟筒，仅矿石就装填了五万吨，一次能出三万吨铁和烧结铁。战士们称它为“天下第一窑”，两旁贴了一幅对联，上联写着：一个土窑铁水淹没英伦岛，下联是：大放卫星浓烟遮盖美国天。群众这种敢想敢作、力争天下第一的雄心大志，真使风云变色，山河崩裂。
    钢铁战士们对紧张愉快的工地生活，已经发生了深厚的感情。柳江县英雄公社社员韦春修，情意深长地说，像这样欢腾热闹的大乐园，在世上往那里找！他愿把老婆孩子接来，在工地上住一辈子。（附图片）
