    Cultivating Talent Can Also Be Done More, Faster, Better, and More Economically
    Yang Xiguang
    Can the work of cultivating talent in institutions of higher education also be carried out in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical, like industrial and agricultural production, to achieve a great leap forward? There are two different answers to this question.
    Some people say: Industrial production and agricultural production can be carried out in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical, but cultural and educational work, especially the work of cultivating talent in institutions of higher education, cannot be carried out in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical. The reason is: knowledge can only be gradually accumulated; to go faster means it can't be better or more economical.
    However, the fact that Shanghai's Fudan University, based on the rectification movement, has implemented the mass line in teaching, conducted creative teaching, and creative learning, refutes this argument and proves that cultural and educational work, including the work of cultivating talent in institutions of higher education, can be carried out in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical. Not only can the speed be accelerated and the quantity increased, but the quality can also be improved. The key is to: strengthen the Party's comprehensive leadership over institutions of higher education, and under the leadership of the Party, realize the three-way combination of the Party committee, teachers, and students; implement the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor; and conduct teaching and learning practically and creatively, linking theory with practice. During the Great Leap Forward, because Fudan University resolutely implemented the Party's education policy, students learned more in a few short weeks than they had previously learned in a much longer period of time. Not only did the quantity increase, but the quality also improved. In the Department of Chemistry, a class of forty-four fourth-year students, combined the current pressing problems in production, and while studying and researching, not only made up for the specialized courses of Organic Analysis and Organic Structure in two weeks and systematically reviewed a chapter of General Organic and Colloid Chemistry, but also cooperated with two other classes to successfully trial-produce more than sixty new products that had never been produced domestically. There are many such examples in the school.
    Based on Fudan University's experience in conducting creative learning in the previous stage, we have realized that in order to implement the Party's education policy in institutions of higher education and cultivate talent in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical, it is first necessary to thoroughly criticize bourgeois educational thought and the educational system, thoroughly realize the educational revolution, and place all the work of institutions of higher education more firmly under the leadership of the Party. Now, let's explain this in three aspects:
    I. The Party's leadership, political command, and constant efforts to grasp the big picture. In the past, at Fudan University, due to the poisoning of bourgeois educational thought and the educational system, and the shackles of dogmatic teaching and learning methods, people were operating under the suppression of a slave mentality, and everything had to be done according to the old almanac. As a result: the atmosphere was relaxed, and there was a sense of stagnation, and the enthusiasm and creativity of teachers and students could not be fully brought into play. This made it possible to carry out the work of cultivating talent only in a manner that was less, slower, worse, and more expensive. Due to the strengthening of the Party's leadership, the implementation of the mass line in teaching, the criticism of bourgeois educational thought and the educational system, and the breaking of dogmatism and slave thinking, the creative spirit and revolutionary drive of people were fully promoted, and the work of cultivating talent immediately took on a new look, full of vitality, with new and ever-changing achievements everywhere, enabling the entire work to leap forward in a manner that was more, faster, better, and more economical. After the graduating class of the Physics Department in 1958 creatively engaged in learning, they completed the design of three sets of microwave measurement systems, manufactured ultra-high frequency millivoltmeters and ultra-short pulse generators, and solved the key problems of infrared thermocouples in less than a month. Using original electronic methods, they carried out the measurement of luminescence material decay, completed the spectral analysis of piano strings entrusted by the factory, and produced transistor oscillators. When the students of the electronics class in this grade, under the leadership of the Party branch, proposed to complete the design of three sets of microwave measurement systems within three days, a veteran teacher who had just returned from the United States said that this was "nonsense" and believed that it would take at least three months to complete even under such good equipment conditions abroad. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the students, after discussion, proposed: "If the professor says it can't be done, we will do it for him to see." As a result, after two days and two nights of hard work, the task was completed. In the face of the facts, the veteran teacher had to concede and repeatedly express his admiration, saying: "I am twenty years behind."
    When they summarized the reasons for achieving these results, they believed that it was due to the establishment of four red flags: The first red flag is the leadership of the Party. This movement was launched under the inspiration of the Party's general line and under the direct leadership of the Party. At the beginning, more than forty students in the Optics class were "working alone," and after a week of work, there were no results, and everyone lacked confidence, and some were dejected. Later, the Party branch helped them solve ideological obstacles such as the belief that "cooperation is hindering and does not solve the problem," established collectivist thinking, insisted on taking the road of collaboration, and organized everyone together, assigning Party members to lead specifically, which led to the situation of catching up from behind and taking the lead. The second red flag is to use redness to lead expertise and use the abstract to lead the concrete. The students said: We have been in college for four years, why were we so inferior before, and a paper took half a year with no results. Now why can we have a great leap forward? The only reason is that politics has taken command, superstitions have been broken, minds have been liberated, and we have mustered enough energy. In the movement, the students fully utilized class-wide evaluations, challenges, small group democratic life, and timely resolution of ideological problems, which achieved great results. The third red flag is the combination of theory and practice. The research topics in this movement are mostly urgently needed for national production and scientific research or are needed for the establishment of laboratories in the department. Because the students clarified the purpose and significance of their work, they were full of energy. The fourth red flag is the road of collaboration. This is the mass line issue of scientific research, and it is also a matter of more, faster, better, and more economical methods. Many people have many ideas, many discussions, quick actions, high enthusiasm, and full confidence. Everyone does their best, and taking the road of collaboration is one of the important conditions for achieving rapid results.
    II. Implement the policy of combining education with productive labor and linking theory with practice, so that learning and application are consistent and learning and creation are closely combined. In our institutions of higher education, there still remains an odious characteristic left over from the old era: the separation of education from productive labor, the separation of book knowledge from practice, and the separation of learning from use. Students learn only book knowledge. Even some of the research topics done by senior students are mostly found by teachers in the corners of the literature. What is the use of doing it? No one knows. Obviously, students trained in this way, who lack independent thinking ability in theory and lack independent working ability in the face of practical problems, cannot meet the requirements of the state for cultivating talent. However, after the innovation of teaching and scientific research work, especially after organizing students to participate in productive labor and doing some scientific research work to serve the development of production, the situation is different. Through the production of bacterial fertilizers, students majoring in microbiology in the Biology Department have mastered more deeply and firmly the professional knowledge in this area, improved their practical ability to apply knowledge, written papers, and significantly improved the quality of their learning. While working in the countryside, students in the Philosophy Department lectured farmers on philosophy. They explained people's subjective initiative and class viewpoint from the perspectives of "why things are done by people and people are bound to conquer nature," "why it is wrong to say that seventy percent depends on heaven and thirty percent depends on people," and "what people say." They used recreational activities, heart-to-heart talks, and other forms to promote atheism to farmers. In this way, they also helped themselves to truly master the ideas of dialectical materialism.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said long ago: "Reading is learning, and using is also learning, and it is even more important learning." Students learn a lot of things in productive labor that cannot be learned from books; at the same time, after mastering certain basic knowledge, going to solve practical problems in production and scientific research not only improves students' ability to independently apply knowledge to solve practical problems but also enlivens students' thinking, enabling them to break through the shackles of books, put forward their own independent opinions, and obtain the ability to develop knowledge creatively. Only in this way can we train truly socialist-minded and cultured laborers who meet the needs of the country in a relatively short period of time.
    III. If institutions of higher education are to cultivate talent in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical, they must fundamentally change the cramming teaching methods and the rote memorization learning methods. In the past, teachers taught alone in the classroom, and the vast majority of students were only the objects of indoctrination. Students often: took notes in class, read notes after class, and memorized notes for exams. Many living and rich knowledge became dead and boring articles. As a result: most students could neither deeply understand knowledge nor develop their cognitive abilities in the learning process. Fudan University changed this situation in the creative learning carried out in the previous stage. Under the leadership of the Party, a method combining Party organizations, teachers, and students was adopted to fully exert the initiative of students in learning, making students masters of knowledge instead of slaves of knowledge. Four worker-peasant students in the Physics Department used to not understand math classes because the teachers made things that were originally clear and easy to understand very complicated and abstract, and they always felt that the theory was profound and difficult to grasp. In creative learning, they formed a group of four people, and after their own exploration, they mastered the learning method from intuitive to rigorous proof when discussing integration, and initially broke the superstition that mathematical theory was mysterious and unpredictable. The students reflected: This is true learning, turning knowledge into something alive and vibrant. The students were liberated from the situation of not being able to leave books and not being able to leave teachers, and they achieved the ability to study and work independently and creatively.
    At the same time, teaching work should also be carried out creatively based on the principle of teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, starting from the actual situation of the students. In the past, the Foreign Languages Department of Fudan University used eighty hours to teach phonetics. Teachers found in this Great Leap Forward that, in fact, it is not difficult for Chinese students to master English phonetics. After the joint efforts of teachers and students, better results can now be obtained in only one-tenth of the time. In the past, many teachers taught college students as if they were children. To learn a word or a grammar, they had to consolidate it again and again before daring to take a step forward; and they had to "master five skills" at the same pace. Now, they have innovated the teaching content, and in the teaching method, they have adopted the method of continuous consolidation in progress and the reading ability taking the lead to drive the other four skills (listening, speaking, writing, and translating), and the annual reading volume can be increased thirty times. Because the teachers in the past regarded the students of New China and the students of the old era as equal and did not see the political awareness and subjective initiative of the students, their estimates of the students in teaching work were often conservative. Now, when they change this view, the progress and quality of teaching are greatly improved.
    All of these prove that: as long as we thoroughly realize the educational revolution under the guidance of the general line and the socialist education policy, carry out creative teaching, closely combine education with productive labor, learning with use, theory with practice, liberate our minds, break the shackles of dogmatism and slave thinking, and crush the bourgeois educational thought and the educational system, the work of cultivating talent in institutions of higher education can be carried out in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical.
    This also proves that: the struggle between more, faster, better, and more economical and less, slower, worse, and more expensive not only exists in teaching work but also in scientific research work. In the past, when many comrades organized scientific research forces, they only saw dozens of experts (most of whom were bourgeois experts) but did not see the strength of the vast student masses. And those bourgeois experts regarded scientific research work as merely a matter of wording. They believed that the results of scientific research were only attainable by chance. However, under the leadership of the Party, with politics in command, clarifying the direction of science serving politics and serving the development of production, and implementing the mass line in scientific research work, the situation immediately changed greatly. The achievements of scientific research work at Fudan University in the past few months far exceed the sum of the past few years, which is a clear proof.
    The general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical is a beacon that illuminates all our work. It has shown unparalleled power on the industrial front and the agricultural front, and it is also showing great power on the cultural and educational front, including the work of cultivating talent and carrying out scientific research in institutions of higher education. Although we need to continue to create experience in this work, and some difficulties will inevitably arise in this process, and we need to go through a period of exploration. However, as long as we resolutely implement the spirit of the general line and the Party's socialist education policy in our work and adhere to the struggle between two roads and two methods on the education front, we will surely see a new situation in cultivating talent in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical.

    培养人才也能多快好省
    杨西光
    高等学校培养人才的工作，能不能够也像工农业生产那样，多快好省地进行，来个大跃进？这个问题，有着两种不同的回答。
    有人说：工业生产和农业生产可以多快好省地进行，但是文教工作，特别是高等学校培养人才的工作，是不可能多快好省地进行的。理由是：知识只能逐渐积累，要多快就不能好省。
    但是，上海复旦大学在整风运动基础上，贯彻教学中的群众路线进行创造性的教学和创造性的学习的事实，驳斥了这种论点，证明了：文教工作，包括高等学校培养人才的工作在内，完全可以多快好省地进行。不但速度可以加快，数量可以增多，并且质量也可以提高。关键在于：加强党对高等学校的全面领导，在党的领导下，实现党委、教师、学生三结合；贯彻教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针；理论联系实际地、创造性地进行教学和学习。复旦大学在大跃进中，由于坚决贯彻了党的教育方针，学生在短短几个星期内所学到的知识，比平时更长的时间所学到的知识丰富得多。不仅在数量上增多，并且在质量上也提高了。化学系四年级一个班四十四个同学，结合当前生产中迫切要求解决的问题，一面研究一面学习，在两个星期内不仅补学了有机分析、有机结构两门专门化课程，较系统地复习了普通有机和胶体化学的一个章，而且和其它两个班合作，试制成功六十多种国内没有生产过的新产品。这种例子，在学校里是很多的。
    根据复旦大学前阶段进行创造性学习的经验，我们体会到，要在高等学校中贯彻党的教育方针，多快好省地培养人才，首先要彻底批判资产阶级教育思想和教育体系，彻底实现教育革命，把高等学校的全部工作更牢固地放在党的领导之下。现在分三个问题来说明：
    一、党的领导，政治挂帅，不断务虚。过去，在复旦大学由于资产阶级教育思想、教育体系的毒害，和教条主义的教学方法、学习方法的束缚，人们在一种奴隶心理的压抑下，一切都要照旧皇历办事。结果是：空气松懈，暮气沉沉，师生的积极性和创造性不能充分地发挥出来。这就使得培养人才的工作只能少慢差费地进行。由于加强了党的领导，在教学中贯彻了群众路线，批判了资产阶级教育思想和教育体系，打破了教条主义和奴隶思想，把人的创造精神和革命干劲充分地发扬起来，培养人才的工作立刻就面貌一新、生气勃勃，到处出现着日新月异的成绩，使整个工作都多快好省地飞跃发展。物理系1958年的毕业班学生在创造性地进行学习后，在不到一个月的时间内，完成了三套微波测量系统的设计，制造了超高频毫伏计和超短脉冲发生器，解决了红外热电偶的关键问题。用独创的电子学方法进行了光致发光材料减衰的测定，完成了工厂委托的琴簧的光谱分析，制成了晶体管振荡器。当这个年级的电子班学生在党支部领导下提出了要在三天内完成三套微波测量系统的设计时，一位刚从美国回国的老教师听到后，说这是“胡闹”，认为在国外那么好的设备条件下，至少也要三个月才能完成。学生在党支部领导下，经过讨论，提出：“教授说不行，我们就搞给他看。”结果苦干了两天两夜，任务就完成了。这位老教师在事实面前，不得不拱手连称钦佩，并且说：“我落后了二十年”。
    他们在总结取得这些成绩的原因时，认为是由于树立了四面红旗：第一面红旗是党的领导。他们这次运动是在党的总路线的鼓舞下、在党的直接领导下搞起来的。光学班四十多个同学开始时“单干”，干了一个星期没有什么结果，大家信心不足，有的垂头丧气。后来党支部帮助他们解决了认为“合作化碍手碍脚，不解决问题”等思想障碍，树立了集体主义思想，坚持走协作道路，并把大家组织起来，派党员专门领导，才出现了后来居上、一马当先的局面。第二面红旗是以红带专，以虚带实。同学们说：我们进大学四年了，为什么以前那么自卑，一篇论文搞了半年，毫无成果。现在为什么能大跃进，唯一的原因就是政治挂了帅，破除了迷信，解放了思想，鼓足了干劲。在运动中，同学们充分运用了大班评比、挑战，小组民主生活，及时解决思想问题，收到了很大的效果。第三面红旗是理论联系实际。这次运动中搞的研究题目，大多是国家生产和科学研究迫切需要的，或者是系里建立实验室所需要的。由于同学们明确了工作的目的和意义，劲头就十足了。第四面红旗是协作的道路。这是科学研究的群众路线问题，也是多快好省的方法问题。人多脑多、议论多、动作快、热气高、信心足，人人各尽所能，走协作的道路，是迅速取得成绩的重要条件之一。
    二、贯彻教育和生产劳动相结合、理论联系实践的方针，使学用一致，把学习和创造紧密地结合起来。在我们高等学校中，至今还存留着旧时代遗留下来的一个可恶的特征：教育和生产劳动隔离，书本知识同实践隔离，学和用隔离。学生学得的都是书本上的知识。就是高年级学生做的一些研究题目，很多也是教师从文献角角里找出来的。做出来有什么用？谁也不知道。这样培养出来的学生，在理论上既缺乏独立思考的能力，在实际问题面前更缺乏独立工作的能力，显然是不能符合国家培养人才的要求的。但是在教学和科学研究工作实现革新以后，特别是组织学生参加生产劳动和做了一部分为发展生产服务的科学研究工作后，情况就不相同了。生物系微生物专门化的学生通过制造细菌肥料，更加深入和牢固地掌握了这方面的专业知识，并且提高了运用知识的实际能力，写出了论文，学习质量有了显著的提高。哲学系学生在农村劳动的同时，向农民讲哲学。他们从“为什么事在人为，人定胜天”“为什么七分靠天，三分靠人是不对的”“什么人说什么话”等来说明人的主观能动性和阶级观点。他们用文娱活动、谈心会等形式向农民宣传无神论。这样，也帮助他们自己真正地掌握了辩证唯物主义的思想。
    毛泽东同志早就说过：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，并且是更重要的学习”。学生在生产劳动中，学到了大量书本上学不到的东西；同时，在掌握了一定的基本知识后，去解决生产和科学研究中的实际问题，不仅提高了学生独立运用知识解决实际问题的能力，并且活泼了学生的思想，使他们能突破书本的束缚，提出自己的独立见解来，取得创造性地发展知识的能力。只有这样，才能在较短的时间内培养出真正符合国家需要的有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者来。
    三、高等学校要多快好省地培养人才，还必须根本改变填鸭式的教学方法和死背死记的学习方法。过去教师一个人在课堂上教，广大学生只是被灌输的对象，同学们常常是：上课记笔记，下课读笔记，考试背笔记。许多活的丰富的知识变成了死的枯燥的条文。结果是：多数学生既不能深刻地领会知识，又不能在学习过程中发展自己的认识能力。复旦大学在前阶段进行的创造性学习中，改变了这种状况。在党的领导下，采取党组织、教师、学生相结合的办法，充分发挥了学生在学习中的主动性，使学生从知识的奴隶变成了知识的主人。物理系有四个工农同学，过去上数学课时，由于教师把原来清楚易懂的东西讲得十分复杂和抽象，他们总是听不懂，觉得理论深奥不易掌握。在创造性学习中，他们四个人组成了一个小组，经过自己的摸索，在讨论积分时掌握了从直观出发到严格证明的学习方法，初步破除了过去认为数学理论神秘莫测的迷信。同学们反映：这才是真正的学习，把知识变成了活的、有生命力的东西。同学们从不能离开书本，不能离开教师的状况下解放出来，达到了有创造的独立学习和工作的能力。
    同时，还应当根据因材施教的原则，从学生的实际情况出发，创造性地进行教学工作。复旦大学外文系，过去用八十个小时教语音，教师们在这次大跃进中发现，实际上中国学生对掌握英国语音困难并不大，经过师生的共同努力，现在只要十分之一的时间就可以得到更好的效果。许多教师过去把大学生当小孩子来教，学一个词或一个语法，必须巩固再巩固才敢前进一步；还要“五会”齐头并进。现在他们革新了教学内容，在教学方法上采取了在前进中不断巩固和阅读能力一马当先带动其它四会（听、讲、写、翻译）的办法，全年阅读量可以提高三十倍。由于教师们过去把新中国的学生和旧时代的学生等量齐观，看不见同学们的政治觉悟和主观能动性，因此，在教学工作中对学生的估计常常是保守的。现在当他们改变了这个看法的时候，教学的进度和质量就大大地提高了。
    所有这些都证明：只要在总路线和社会主义教育方针的指导下，彻底实现教育革命，进行创造性的教学，把教育和生产劳动、学和用、理论和实践紧密结合起来，解放思想，打破教条主义和奴隶思想的束缚，粉碎资产阶级的教育思想和教育体系，高等学校培养人才的工作是完全能够多快好省地进行的。
    这同样也证明：多快好省和少慢差费的斗争，不仅在教学工作中存在，在科学研究工作中也同样地存在。过去很多同志在组织科学研究力量时，只看到几十个专家（其中大多数是资产阶级专家），却没有看到广大学生群众的力量。而那些资产阶级专家，对科学研究工作又看作只是字里行间的功夫。他们认为科学研究的成果，是可遇而不可求的。但是，在党的领导下，政治挂帅，明确了科学为政治服务、为发展生产服务的方向，贯彻了科学研究工作中的群众路线以后，情况也立刻发生了很大的变化。复旦大学最近几个月科学研究工作的成绩远远超过了过去几年的总和，就是一个明证。
    鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是照耀我们一切工作的灯塔。它在工业战线上、农业战线上已经显示出无比的威力，在文教战线上，包括高等学校培养人才和开展科学研究的工作，也正在显示出巨大的力量。虽然我们在这个工作中还要继续创造经验，在这个过程中也不可能不发生一些困难，还要经过一段摸索。但是，只要我们坚决地在自己的工作中贯彻总路线的精神和党的社会主义教育方针，坚持在教育战线上两条道路两种方法的斗争，我们就一定会在多快好省地培养人才上出现一个新的局面。
