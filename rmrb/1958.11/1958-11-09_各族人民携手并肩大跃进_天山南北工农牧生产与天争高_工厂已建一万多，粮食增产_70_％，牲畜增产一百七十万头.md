(Our Urumqi Dispatch, November 8th) The people of all nationalities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are working together for the Great Leap Forward, achieving tremendous results in industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production in the northern and southern Tianshan Mountains, and greatly changing the face of remote and backward areas.

To date, a number of local industries have been established in various ethnic autonomous prefectures, special districts, and counties. More than 10,000 factories and more than 80,000 iron-smelting furnaces have been built throughout the autonomous region. Nearly 600,000 people are working day and night on the iron and steel front, which is ten times the total number of workers in the industrial sector of the autonomous region at the beginning of this year. Some large backbone factories are also under intense construction, including the Urumqi Hongyanchi Thermal Power Plant with a total power generation capacity of 900,000 kilowatts, the Urumqi Coalfield Sidaocha Pingdong with an annual output of 900,000 tons of raw coal, the Kashi Hydropower Station, the Hami-Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County Iron and Coking Coal Base, and ten machinery manufacturing plants and electrical machinery manufacturing plants in Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture and Urumqi City. With the support of Han cadres and workers, some previously uninhabited Gobi deserts and barren mountains, such as Baluntai in the central Tianshan Mountains under the Bayingoleng Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, Dahongshan in the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, and the Kuqa Depression in the Tarim Basin, have been rapidly built into emerging iron and steel and petroleum bases in the autonomous region. With the support of Han workers and Uyghur farmers, the highway to Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County on the Pamir Plateau has been completed and opened to traffic. The technical level of workers of all nationalities is also rapidly improving under the slogan of "Learning from the Han nationality and catching up with the whole country," and thousands of new products that Xinjiang had never produced before have been trial-produced, including various types of machine tools, universal tractors, trucks, complete sets of power generation equipment and complete sets of smelting equipment, as well as coal tar, reactive dyes, and colored floral fabrics.

The leap forward in agricultural production and the appearance of the countryside is even more prominent. This spring, farmers of all nationalities braved the severe cold and launched a mass campaign to build water conservancy projects and reclaim wasteland. In many areas, the attendance rate of agricultural cooperative members reached more than 90%. Uyghur women, who were locked in their houses before liberation and still wore veils a few years ago, have participated in major labor this year at a rate of 90%. To date, the wasteland reclamation army, mainly composed of production and construction corps, has reclaimed more than 5 million mu of wasteland, and 108 new state-owned and local state-owned farms have been built on the winding Tarim River and the ancient wilderness of the Junggar Basin, exceeding the total number of farms established in the past eight years. Various crops have also achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. The autonomous region has become a 100-jin ginned cotton area, with an average yield of 321 jin per mu of grain. Compared with last year, the total grain output has increased by 70%, cotton by 81%, and oil crops by 27%. The grain produced this year alone is equal to three times the total grain output in 1949 at the time of liberation. Miquan County in Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture and Bachu County, a Uyghur-populated area in the western Tarim Basin, have respectively leaped into thousand-jin counties for rice and corn, reaching the production level of the Jiangnan region. Calculated by the population of the entire autonomous region, the average person has 1,200 jin of grain, 30 jin of cotton, and 19 jin of vegetable oil. The countryside presents a scene of abundance everywhere.

In the mountainous and remote areas inhabited by Kazakh, Mongolian, Kyrgyz, and Tajik nationalities, industries such as power generation, mining, iron smelting, flour milling, and milk processing have been established this year. Agriculture in these areas has also developed rapidly. According to statistics from seven counties in Altay Prefecture, the area sown with grain has increased by 200,000 mu this year. The original purely pastoral economic areas have all realized the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, and 80% of the herdsmen have fixed houses. New villages surrounded by farmland can be seen everywhere in the Tianshan pastures and at the foot of the Altai Mountains. On the basis of the basic completion of the socialist transformation of animal husbandry and the great development of agriculture and industry, animal husbandry production has also begun to leap forward. This year, the lambing survival rate reached 95%. Last year, the entire autonomous region had only one state-owned ranch with 10,000 sheep and 10,000 lambs. This year, there is one ranch with 1,000 cattle and 1,000 calves, twenty state-owned ranches and reclamation areas with 10,000 sheep and 10,000 lambs, and a large number of animal husbandry cooperatives with 1,000 sheep and 1,000 lambs. This year, the total number of livestock in the entire autonomous region increased by more than 1.7 million head compared with last year. The comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region this year proves that under the correct leadership of the Party, ethnic minorities can completely advance at high speed, build socialism, and completely shatter the erroneous ideas of "regional backwardness," "minority nationality exceptionalism," and "conditionalism," as well as the various slanders of local nationalists, creating good ideological and material conditions for rapidly building the autonomous region into a new industrial base and agricultural and pastoral base in our country.

    各族人民携手并肩大跃进
    天山南北工农牧生产与天争高
    工厂已建一万多，粮食增产70％，牲畜增产一百七十万头
    本报乌鲁木齐8日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各民族人民，携手并肩大跃进，天山南北工、农、牧业生产成绩巨大，边远落后地区的面貌也大为改观。
    到目前为止，各民族自治州、专区、县，都已建立起一批地方工业。全自治区已经建起一万多个工厂，八万多座炼铁炉，单是在钢铁战线上日夜苦战的就有近六十万人，等于今年年初全自治区工业部门工人总数的十倍。一些大型骨干工厂也正在紧张施工，其中有全部发电能力为九十万瓩的乌鲁木齐红雁池火电站，年产九十万吨原煤的乌鲁木齐煤田四道岔平洞，喀什水电站，哈密——巴里坤哈萨克族自治县钢铁和焦煤基地，昌吉回族自治州和乌鲁木齐市的十个机械制造厂和电机制造厂等。在汉族干部和工人的支援下，原来一些渺无人烟的戈壁、荒山，如巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州属下天山中部的巴仑台，昌吉回族自治州的大黄山，塔里木盆地的库车洼地等处，已经迅速建成为自治区新兴的钢铁和石油基地，在汉族工人和维吾尔族农民的支援下，通往帕米尔高原上塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县的公路已经建成通车。各民族工人的技术水平也在“学习汉族，赶上全国”的口号下飞速提高，试制了成千上万种新疆过去从来没有生产过的新产品，包括各型机床、万能拖拉机、载重汽车、成套发电设备和成套冶炼设备以及煤焦油、活性染料、色香花布。
    农业生产和农村面貌的跃进更为突出。今年春天，各族农民就冒着严寒，展开了全民性的修水利，开荒运动。许多地区农业社社员出勤率达到90％以上。解放前被锁在房子里，几年以前还披带面纱的维吾尔族妇女，今年有90％都参加了主要劳动。到目前为止，以生产兵团为主力的开荒大军已经开荒五百多万亩，在蜿蜒千里的塔里木河两岸和准噶尔盆地古老的荒原上，新建起一百零八所国营和地方国营农场，超过已往八年来建立农场的总和。各种农作物也获得空前大丰收，自治区已成为百斤皮棉区，粮食平均亩产达到三百二十一斤，和去年比较，粮食总产量增加了70％，棉花增加了81％，油料增加了27％，单是今年一年生产的粮食，就等于解放时1949年粮食总产量的三倍。昌吉回族自治州的米泉县、塔里木盆地西部维吾尔族聚居的巴楚县，已分别跃为水稻和玉米千斤县，达到了江南产量水平。按全自治区人口计算产量，平均每人有粮食一千二百斤，棉花三十斤，植物油十九斤，农村到处呈现着丰衣足食的景象。
    在哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克孜、塔吉克等民族聚居的山区和边远地区，今年已分别建立了发电、采矿、炼铁、面粉、牛奶加工等工业。这些地区的农业也发展得很快，据阿勒泰专区七个县的统计，今年就增加粮食播种面积二十万亩。原来的纯牧业经济地区，已全部实现了农牧结合，80％的牧民都有了固定房屋，在天山牧场、阿尔泰山麓，到处都可以看到农田环绕的新村。在畜牧业社会主义改造基本完成和农业、工业大发展的基础上，畜牧业生产也开始跃进，今年羊的繁殖成活率达到了95％，去年全自治区只有一个万羊万羔国营牧场，今年有一个千牛千犊场，二十个万羊万羔国营牧场、垦区和大批千羊千羔牧业社。今年全自治区各种牲畜共比去年净增了一百七十多万头。新疆维吾尔自治区今年工、农、牧业的全面大跃进，证明了少数民族在党的正确领导下，完全可能高速度前进，建成社会主义，彻底粉碎了“地区落后论”、“少数民族特殊论”、“条件论”等等错误的思想和地方民族主义分子的种种谰言，为把自治区迅速建成为我国新兴的工业基地和农业、牧业基地创造了思想上和物质上的良好条件。
