Mass Movement Breaks Through Conservative Thinking
Chongqing Steel Unearths Huge Potential

(Our newspaper Chongqing, November 18th dispatch) Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has been vigorously launching a mass movement and deeply carrying out technological revolution, resulting in a new leap forward in production.

Since October, major innovations and creations that have broken through the key to production have continuously emerged in this company. Steel production in October increased by 84% compared to September, and steel material production has also been continuously improving.

Starting in October, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company launched a mass speaking out, mass airing of views, and mass debate movement to liberate thinking among cadres and workers. Under the influence of the rapid development of the national steel front, leading cadres in various factories and workshops criticized the ideas of not believing in the masses and not relying on the masses, and felt that the heavier the production tasks, the more necessary it was to let go and mobilize the masses and rely on the masses; through speaking out and debates, workers broke through all conservative ideas that were afraid of difficulties and did not dare to boldly innovate and create. All employees of the company felt that only by breaking the shackles of those outdated technical concepts, unreasonable technical regulations, and empiricism, and boldly innovating technology, could they catch up with the advanced national level by leaps and bounds.

Since October, the steelmaking workshop has used a large amount of native iron for steelmaking. The high content of impurities in native iron has brought great difficulties to production. In the mass speaking out, workers criticized the conservative idea that good steel could not be made from native iron, and adopted various desulfurization and dephosphorization methods in the pig iron furnace and open hearth furnace, and finally overcame this difficulty, ensuring that both steel production and quality did not decline.

The rapid increase in steelmaking production created conditions for the rolling mill department to improve production, and also promoted the rapid advancement of rolling mill production. Under the slogan of catching up with the steelmaking workers by leaps and bounds, the rolling mill workers improved their work in terms of strengthening equipment maintenance, improving equipment production efficiency, rapid rolling, and rapid roll changing. The production level of various steel materials is also rising step by step. Under the circumstances that a large number of workers were transferred to support steelmaking production, the output of steel products in October increased by 13% compared with September, and continued to rise in the first half of November.

    群众运动冲破保守思想
    重钢挖出巨大潜力
    本报重庆18日电　重庆钢铁公司大搞群众运动，深入开展技术革命，生产上出现了一个新的跃进局面。
    10月份以来，这个公司突破生产关键的重大革新创造不断出现。钢的产量10月份比9月份增长了84％，钢材产量也在不断提高。
    重庆钢铁公司从10月份起在干部和职工中展开了大鸣大放大辩论的解放思想运动。在全国钢铁战线飞跃发展的形势影响下，各工厂和车间的领导干部批判了不相信群众、不依靠群众的思想，感觉到生产任务越重，就越是要放手发动群众和依靠群众；职工中通过鸣放和辩论，冲破了一切畏难、不敢大胆革新创造的保守思想。全公司的职工都感觉到，只有打破那些陈旧了的技术观念、不合理的技术规程和经验主义的束缚，大胆革新技术，才能大踏步地赶上全国先进水平。
    炼钢车间从10月份起大量使用土铁炼钢，土铁含杂质成分高给生产上带来了很大的困难。工人们在大鸣大放中批判了认为土铁炼不出好钢的保守思想，在化铁炉和平炉采取了多种脱硫、脱磷办法，终究战胜了这个难关，保证了钢的产量和质量都没有下降。
    炼钢生产的飞快上升，为轧钢部门提高生产创造了条件，同时也推动轧钢生产快速前进。轧钢工人在大步追赶炼钢工人的口号下，从加强设备维护、提高设备生产效率、快速轧制、快速换辊等方面改进工作，各种钢材生产水平也在步步上升。在抽调了大批工人支援炼钢生产的情况下，10月份钢材产量还比9月份提高了13％，11月上半月又继续上升。
