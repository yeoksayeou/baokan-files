    Cuban Dictatorial Government Has Lost Popular Support
    Forces Supporting the Uprising are Expanding Daily
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 17th: The forces within Cuba opposing the dictatorial regime and supporting the uprising movement are expanding daily. According to delayed news, Manuel León Ramírez, the original presidential candidate of the ruling Progressive Action Party, and Eduardo Roca, a candidate for Congress, announced their withdrawal from the election before the election and joined the rebel army. The two men delivered speeches on the rebel army's radio station, exposing the reactionary nature of the Cuban dictatorial government and the deceptive nature of this election. They said that they "do not want to be part of this government anymore."
    Ramón Grau San Martín, the presidential candidate of the Cuban Revolutionary Party representing the interests of the bourgeoisie and landlords, also said that this election was forced and deceptive. He demanded that the election be held again.
    Many reports indicate that the morale within the government army is very low, with people constantly defecting to the rebel army. Veteran soldiers do not want to fight, and the morale of newly recruited mercenaries is even lower. Recently, two companies of the government army, along with their company commanders, defected to the rebel army.
    The dictatorial regime is increasingly losing popular support. Even mouthpieces of the American ruling class doubt how long this dictatorial regime can last. The "New York Times" of November 7th said, "A third or half of the country is in a state of civil war; ... one of the most brutal dictatorships ever seen in Latin America is suppressing the rebellious people." When talking about the presidential "election" arranged by the dictator, the "New York Times" had to admit: "In fact, the entire procedure (of the election) is false." The newspaper pointed out that Batista held the "election" with the aim of having Agüero (the newly "elected" president) inherit his mantle, but "even with General Batista's iron fist support, it is doubtful whether he (Agüero) can do this for long."

    古巴独裁政府失尽人心
    拥护起义的力量日益扩大
    新华社17日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴国内反对独裁政权和拥护起义运动的力量日益扩大了。据迟到消息，执政党进步行动党的原定总统候选人曼努埃尔·莱昂·腊米雷斯以及国会议员候选人爱德华多·罗加在选举前宣布退出选举，投奔了起义军。他们两人在起义军的电台上发表演说，揭露古巴独裁政府的反动性和这次选举的欺骗性。他们说，他们“不想成为这个政府的一部分了”。
    代表资产阶级和地主利益的古巴革命党总统候选人拉蒙·格劳·圣马丁也说，这次选举是强迫的，并且是欺骗的。他要求重新举行选举。
    许多消息表明，政府军内部军心十分涣散，不断有人投向起义军，老兵不想作战，新招募来的雇佣兵士气更为低落。最近政府军有两个连队连同他们的连长一起投向起义军。
    独裁政权正愈来愈失尽人心。甚至连美国统治集团的喉舌也怀疑这个独裁政权能够维持多久。11月7日的“纽约时报”说，“这个国家的三分之一或者半数的人处于内战状态中；……一个拉丁美洲所见过的最凶暴的专制政权在制止着反叛的人民。”“纽约时报”在谈到独裁者所布置的总统“选举”时也不得不承认：“其实，（选举的）整个程序都是虚假的。”这家报纸指出，巴蒂斯塔举办“选举”的目的是要阿古埃罗（新“当选”的总统）来继承他的衣钵，但是，“即使是在巴蒂斯塔将军铁腕支持下，他（阿古埃罗）能否长期这样作也是有疑问的”。
