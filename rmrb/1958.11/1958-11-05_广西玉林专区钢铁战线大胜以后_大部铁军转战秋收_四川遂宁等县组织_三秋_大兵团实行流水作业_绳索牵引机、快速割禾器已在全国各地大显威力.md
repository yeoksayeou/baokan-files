According to Guangxi Daily: The vast cadres and masses in the Yulin Special District of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region recently returned triumphantly from the steel battlefield and immediately threw themselves into the autumn harvest battle. With the exception of a portion of the labor force continuing to hold the steel front, the majority of the manpower has been invested in the autumn harvest. As of October 26th, 1.05 million troops had rushed to the autumn harvest battlefield, increasing the harvesting speed by three and a half times compared to before October 23rd.

Due to the immediate transfer from the steel battlefield to the autumn harvest, some cadres and masses experienced a slackening of enthusiasm. Various localities, through convening celebrations of the steel victory and oath-taking rallies for the autumn harvest, evaluating achievements and commending models, criticized some incorrect thoughts and held debates around the following questions: Should ripe rice be harvested immediately? What are the harms of delaying the harvest? Is the idea of resting for a few days before harvesting correct? How can the autumn harvest task be completed quickly and well? After the debate, it was unanimously agreed that this year's late rice ripened early, ripened in large quantities, and some had already reached the point of threshing. If it was not harvested quickly, the losses would be great. Moreover, the tasks of deep plowing and water conservancy were very heavy, and a slight delay would put all the work in a passive position. After the debate, the vast cadres and masses expressed their determination to immediately engage in the rush harvesting battle.

From cadres to the masses, a communist labor emulation campaign has been launched everywhere. More than 5,000 soldiers from the Daxu Commune in Guixian County, who had just transferred from the steel battlefield, carried their luggage to the oath-taking rally, determined to fight hard for nine days and complete the autumn harvest task of 44,000 mu. Among the 17,000 people participating in the autumn harvest in the Daxuan District of Guiping, 14,500 were eating and living in the fields, fighting bravely and arduously.

In order to mobilize various forces to support the autumn harvest, a widespread large-scale cooperation movement was launched. Government officials, teachers, students, urban residents, etc., all actively transferred to the autumn harvest battlefield. Pingnan County alone mobilized more than 90,000 people to join the autumn harvest battle. Various functional departments are also vigorously supporting the autumn harvest in various ways. The Bureau of Commerce is leading cadres to the countryside to help communes plan sideline occupations, improve vegetable production, and increase members' incomes; the Bureau of Finance and the Tax Bureau, in addition to doing a good job in tax collection, are also helping communes clear financial accounts and do a good job in distribution; the Grain Bureau is focusing on grasping the autumn harvest warehouses, helping communes verify output, inspect warehouses, and train storage personnel; the Civil Affairs Section and the County Women's Federation are mainly helping communes run public canteens and nurseries (institutions). While rushing to harvest, various localities also paid attention to the storage of rice to prevent mold and rot.

In addition to a large amount of labor being transferred from steel to the autumn harvest, various localities are also continuing to vigorously reform tools in an effort to rapidly increase the efficiency of harvesting and deep plowing.

According to the Sichuan Daily: Suining, Shehong, Pengxi, Tongnan, and other counties in Sichuan Province have adopted professional teams and large corps to cooperate in combat, making a concentrated effort on the "Three Autumns," so that labor efficiency has increased by another 50% on the basis of the already greatly improved efficiency, achieving meticulous harvesting, good storage, deep plowing, dense planting, and careful selection of seeds.

When organizing professional teams and large corps to fight, the people's communes in these counties generally formulated unified combat plans, made specific arrangements by large and medium teams, and used small and medium teams as combat units, while large corps played a shock role. The people's communes in Pengxi, Shehong, and other counties were divided into professional teams for grain, vegetables, pig raising, etc., according to the crop planting situation. Each professional team was allocated a certain number of plowing cattle and agricultural implements as the basic unit of the people's commune. Some urgent tasks in current production were then tackled by large corps.

Suining, Pengxi, Shehong, and other counties implemented the "five fixings" and "five to the fields" contract system in the organization of professional teams and large corps, and promoted assembly line operations and professional operation methods. The content of the "five fixings" is to fix output, fix quality, fix time, fix labor, and fix cost; the content of the "five to the fields" is to bring fertilizer, seeds, crops, technology, and indicators to the fields.

In order to better promote the assembly line operation method, the Fuxing, Qinggang, Dagan, Taiyi, and other districts of Shehong County formed three armies: the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting armies. These three armies closely cooperated and adopted the assembly line operation method for production. As the autumn harvest army cleared a piece of land, the autumn plowing army immediately plowed it; they plowed and fertilized at the same time, and helped clear the land after plowing. After plowing a piece of land, the autumn planting army immediately went to the battlefield to sow seeds. When necessary, the three teams would concentrate to carry out a general attack. This achieved fast action, rapid completion of tasks, and high quality work, with the "Three Autumns" being completed at once. The implementation of this assembly line operation method further brought into play the labor enthusiasm and expertise of each person and overcame phenomena such as unclear responsibilities, wasted work time, and waste. After adopting this method, the Jinhua District of Shehong County generally increased labor efficiency by more than 50%.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th - The rope traction machines, fast rice harvesters, and other new agricultural tools promoted in various localities have shown great power in the "Three Autumns" work, effectively alleviating the labor shortage that appeared during the Great Leap Forward.

Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, the two provinces that have promoted rope traction machines the fastest in the country, have made rapid progress in deep plowing and wheat planting work, even though a large number of laborers have been drawn out for iron smelting. Due to the extensive use of rope traction machines, Jiangsu Province has deep plowed 15 million mu of land. After Suixi County, Anhui Province, promoted nearly 20,000 rope traction machines, the progress of autumn planting has jumped from the original 30,000 mu per day to 110,000 mu. This year, Mengquan Commune in Shimen County, Hunan Province, plans to deep plow 36,100 mu of land to a depth of one foot; if rope traction machines are not used, it would take more than a month for all 8,589 laborers in the commune to be fully mobilized, and the quality could not be guaranteed. After the commune held an on-site meeting to show the benefits of rope traction machines, the masses donated wood and rope and rushed to manufacture 560 rope traction machines in three days and two nights, quickly plowing 15,200 mu to a depth of one foot and two inches. Now, the commune is installing ball bearings on the plows of the rope traction machines in order to complete the deep plowing task faster. In areas where promotion and use are more common, the masses have new creations and developments in both manufacturing and use: Shandong has widely promoted wind traction; Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, has created a pileless traction machine and a rope traction deep plowing and fertilization combined machine; Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, has created a rope traction soil transport vehicle; Fugu County, Henan Province, not only uses rope traction machines to plow the land, but also uses them to harrow, sow, and make ridges.

During the autumn harvest, the promotion of fast rice harvesters in some areas of the southern provinces also played a major role. Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, has a total of 410,000 mu of late rice; if harvested with sickles, it would take at least 500,000 workdays. However, after the county's masses fought hard for five days and nights, they manufactured more than 35,000 fast rice harvesters, eliminating sickles, so it only took five days and 100,000 workdays to complete the harvest. According to Hubei Province's calculations, if fast rice harvesters are used throughout the province, more than 15 million workdays can be saved, which is equivalent to the work of 500,000 people for a month. Hunan Province has promoted rice harvesters more widely. Changde County harvested 170,000 mu of late rice with rice harvesters on October 15th alone, also completely eliminating sickles. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has already promoted more than 110,000 harvesters, increasing rice harvesting efficiency by two to three times.

In addition, the reform and promotion of tools for threshing, processing, transportation, sowing, etc., has also solved the labor shortage problem in many areas during the Three Autumns. In Nanchong Special District, Sichuan Province, tool reforms were carried out only in the harvesting and transportation of sweet potatoes, which saved 7,000 workdays. In October, all the laborers in the Gongchang Commune of Jianli County, Hubei Province, could originally only do 400,000 standard workdays, which was more than 700,000 workdays short. The commune members carried out tool reforms in many ways, such as changing wheat planting to dense strip sowing drills, changing grain sorting to threshing machines, realizing vehicle and ship transportation, and realizing semi-mechanized rice milling. As a result, not only was the labor deficit made up, but there were also 120,000 workdays surplus.

### 广西玉林专区钢铁战线大胜以后  大部铁军转战秋收  四川遂宁等县组织“三秋”大兵团实行流水作业  绳索牵引机、快速割禾器已在全国各地大显威力

    广西玉林专区钢铁战线大胜以后
    大部铁军转战秋收
    四川遂宁等县组织“三秋”大兵团实行流水作业
    绳索牵引机、快速割禾器已在全国各地大显威力
    据广西日报消息：广西僮族自治区玉林专区广大干部群众最近刚从钢铁战场凯旋归来，又立即投入了秋收大战。各地除留一部分劳力继续坚持钢铁战斗外，大部人力都已投入秋收。到10月26日止，已有一百零五万大军奔向秋收战地，收割速度比23日以前增加了三倍半。
    由于从钢铁战场马上转到秋收，部分干部群众存在松劲情绪。各地通过召开钢铁庆功和秋收誓师大会、评功表模等办法，对一些不正确思想进行了批判，并围绕以下几个问题进行辩论：禾熟了要不要立即收割？迟割有什么害处？休息几天再割的想法对不对？怎样又快又好完成秋收任务等。辩论后，一致认为今年晚稻熟的早，熟的多，有的已熟到脱粒了，再不快收，损失就很大，而且深耕、水利任务又很繁重，稍迟一下，全盘工作都将被动。经过辩论，广大干部群众都表示要立即投入抢收战斗。
    各地从干部到群众，到处掀起了共产主义劳动大竞赛。贵县大墟公社刚从钢铁战场转来的五千多战士，许多人背着行李参加誓师大会，下决心苦战九日，完成四万四千亩秋收任务。桂平大宣区参加秋收的一万七千多人，即有一万四千五百人食在田头，住在田头奋勇苦战。
    为了动员各种力量支援秋收，广泛开展了大协作运动。机关干部、教师、学生、城镇居民等都积极转入秋收战场。仅平南县就动员了九万多人投入秋收战斗。各业务部门也正在从各方面大力支援秋收。商业局带领干部下乡帮助公社规划副业，搞好蔬菜生产，增加社员收入；财政局、税务局除搞好税收外，还帮助公社清理财务账目，搞好分配；粮食局则着重抓好秋收仓库，帮助公社核实产量，检查仓库，训练保管人员等；民政科和县妇联主要帮助公社搞好公共食堂和托儿组（所）。各地在抢收同时，还注意了稻谷的保管，防止霉烂。
    除了劳力大量从钢铁转入秋收以外，各地还在继续大闹工具改革，力争迅速提高收割、深耕效率。
    据四川日报消息：四川省遂宁、射洪、蓬溪、潼南等县采用专业队和大兵团协同作战，突击“三秋”，使劳动效率在原来已经大大提高的基础上又提高50％，做到了收得细、藏得好、耕得深、种得密，种子选得精。
    这些县的人民公社在组织专业队和大兵团作战时，一般都统一制订了作战规划，分大、中队进行具体安排，以中、小队为作战单位，大兵团则发挥突击作用。蓬溪、射洪等县的人民公社按照作物种植情况，分成粮食、蔬菜、养猪等专业队。每一个专业队分配一定数量的耕牛和农具，作为人民公社的基本单位。当前生产中的一些紧急任务，则由大兵团突击。
    遂宁、蓬溪、射洪等县在组织专业队和大兵团作战中，实行了“五定”“五到田”的包工制，推行流水作业法和专业操作法。“五定”的内容是定产量、定质量、定时间、定劳力、定成本；“五到田”的内容是肥料、种子、作物、技术、指标等到田。
    为了很好地推行流水作业法，射洪县的复兴、青岗、大干、太乙等区组成秋收、秋耕、秋种三路大军。这三路大军紧密配合，采取流水作业法进行生产。秋收大军腾出一块地、秋耕大军就马上耕完一块地；边耕边施肥，耕完又帮助腾地。耕完一块地，秋种大军又立即上战场播种。必要时，三套人马又集中起来进行总攻。这样就做到了行动快、任务完成快、活路质量高，
  “三秋”一道清。实行这种流水作业法以后，进一步发挥了每个人的劳动积极性和专长，克服了责任不明、窝工浪费等现象。射洪县金华区在采用这个办法以后，普遍提高劳动效率50％以上。
    新华社4日讯　各地推广的绳索牵引机、快速割禾器等新农具已经在三秋工作中大显威力，有效地缓和了大跃进中出现的劳动力紧张情况。
    全国推广绳索牵引机最快的山东、江苏两省，虽然抽出大批劳动力炼铁，但是深耕和种麦工作仍然进展迅速。江苏省由于大量使用绳索牵引机，深翻耕地已达一千五百万亩。安徽省濉溪县推广近两万部绳索牵引机后，秋种进度已经由原来的每天三万亩跃到十一万亩。湖南省石门县蒙泉公社今年计划深翻耕地三万六千一百亩，深度一尺；如果不用绳索牵引机，全社八千五百八十九个劳动力全部出动也需一个多月，并且还不能保证质量。这个公社召开现场会议显示绳索牵引机的好处后，群众捐献木料和绳索，三天两夜就突击制造出五百六十部绳索牵引机，很快就耕了一万五千二百亩，深达一尺二寸。现在这个公社又在给绳索牵引的犁安装滚珠，以便更快地完成深翻任务。凡是推广使用较普遍的地区，群众在制造和使用两方面都有新的创造和发展：山东较普遍地推广了风力牵引；浙江省长兴县创造了不打桩的牵引机和绳索牵引深耕施肥联合器；江苏省太仓县创造了绳索牵引运土车；河南省扶沟县不仅用绳索牵引机翻地，并且用它耙地、播种和打畦。
    秋收中，南方各省部分地区推广快速割禾器，发挥作用也大。湖北省应城县的晚稻共四十一万亩，如用镰刀收割至少要五十万工。但是全县群众苦战五昼夜，制造了三万五千多部快速割禾器，消灭了镰刀，这样只需五天时间、十万个工就可完成收割。据湖北省计算，如果全省使用快速割禾器，就可以节省一千五百多万工，等于五十万人一个月的工作量。湖南省推广割禾器较普遍。常德县在10月15日一天就用割禾器收割了十七万亩晚稻，也彻底消灭了镰刀。广西僮族自治区已经推广收割器十一万多部，水稻收割效率提高了两三倍。
    此外，脱粒、加工、运输、播种等工具的改革和推广，也解决了许多地区三秋中的劳力不足问题。四川省南充专区仅在甘薯的收挖和运输方面进行工具改革，就节省了七千个劳动日。湖北省监利县龚场公社全部劳动力10月份原来只能做四十万个标准工，差七十多万个工，社员们从多方面进行工具改革，如种麦改用密植条播耧，扮禾改用脱粒机，运输实行车船化，碾米实现半机械化。结果不但弥补了劳动力的赤字，还多余了十二万个工。
