Fully Mobilize the Masses to Make a Concentrated Effort to Harvest, Sell, and Transport
Sharp Increase in Procurement of Agricultural Products
Jiangxi Nearly Completes Annual Plan / Jiangsu Cotton Purchased Quickly and Transported Quickly / Shandong Launches Major Inspection and Competition

According to the Jiangxi Daily, a high tide in the agricultural product procurement movement has been set off in Jiangxi Province, and the amount of procurement has greatly increased. The province has completed 92.9% of this year's annual state procurement plan. Nine counties—Ganxian, Xunwu, Longnan, Anyuan, Huichang, Yudu, Guangchang, Chongyi, and Pingxiang—and Shangrao City have completed all agricultural product procurement plans ahead of schedule. In addition, thirty-four counties have completed the procurement plans for cotton, tobacco, hemp, and live pigs respectively. The province's outward transfer plan has also been well completed: live pigs have completed 153% of the annual plan, ramie 100%, jute 91.4%, and cotton 80%.

The above achievements were mainly due to the timely implementation of the instructions of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee in various places. Party and government leaders personally took charge of procurement work, using the method of a large-scale movement encompassing small-scale movements, relying on and mobilizing the broad masses to make concentrated efforts to harvest, sell, and transport, thereby greatly accelerating the progress of procurement. Many regions, through airing views, debates, and big-character posters, have also greatly broken the pessimistic argument that "current labor shortages make it impossible to carry out agricultural product procurement work." By tapping into the potential labor force in society, the province has organized a labor army of 300,000 to 500,000 people, often focusing on the central task, taking advantage of gaps, seizing time, and carrying out concentrated procurement in batches and at any time.

The experience of many places proves that as long as leadership is strengthened, overall arrangements are made, the potential of labor is tapped, and time is rationally arranged, the procurement of agricultural products can be combined with large-scale steel production and autumn harvesting and planting. Taking Ganxian as an example, during the high-yield steel week from October 15 to 21, they overfulfilled the pig iron task by 109.1%. Before October 27, they also completed all autumn harvesting tasks, and the annual procurement tasks of several major agricultural products such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, tea, and red melon seeds were also overfulfilled.

Nanjing, November 10 (By Telegraph) - With a vigorous launch of a mass movement, the amount of cotton purchased in Jiangsu Province has soared. Since the province launched a concentrated effort movement on October 25, the average daily purchase volume has increased by more than 60% compared with the past. The cotton purchased this year, converted into ginned cotton, is nearly two million dan, an increase of five times compared with the same period last year.

Jiangsu Province has had a bumper cotton harvest this year, with an estimated total output of eight million dan, more than double that of last year. The bumper harvest has brought favorable conditions for commercial departments to expand procurement. However, some people's communes in some areas did not properly arrange and extract a certain amount of labor to carry out cotton sales work due to the tension of steel production, autumn harvesting, and autumn planting. In addition, the commercial departments did not change the procurement methods according to the new situation, and the progress of cotton purchase was very slow, and the completion of the plan was poor. After the CPC Central Committee and the State Council jointly issued instructions for concentrated procurement and transportation of agricultural products, the county committees of the CPC in Jiangsu Province conducted a comprehensive inspection of the cotton procurement work in the previous stage, requiring all people's communes to unify the arrangement of labor under the principle of "marshal taking the lead, advancing first, and all work keeping up," drilling the seams of agricultural production gaps, and carrying out a mass concentrated effort movement. Through airing views, debates, and big-character posters, the commercial departments' right-leaning conservative ideas such as following old ways and waiting for customers to come to their door were criticized. This reversed the slow procurement situation, and the average daily purchase volume in the province increased from more than 50,000 dan to more than 80,000 dan. In Nantong, Yancheng, and Suzhou prefectures, the key cotton-producing areas, the mass line of procurement methods of boldly mobilizing the masses, relying on the people's communes to conduct self-inspection, self-weighing, self-packaging, and self-transportation, have overfulfilled the October cotton procurement plan.

Various localities have tried every means to solve the difficulties in processing and transportation brought about by the increase in cotton procurement volume. The Suzhou Prefecture has carried out technical reforms in cotton processing to increase hourly output; it has equipped sufficient manpower and vigorously organized manual cotton gins. The daily output of ginned cotton in the district in late October was 14,000 dan, an increase of 56% compared with the first and middle ten days of the month. This prefecture used "five boats" (tugs, barges, inland river boats, farm boats, empty return boats), combined ships and vehicles, short-distance concentration, and long-distance transportation to ensure that ginning factories did not run out of seed cotton and yarn factories did not run out of ginned cotton. In October, more than 700,000 dan of ginned cotton were shipped in a timely manner to support the production of textile factories in Wuxi, Shanghai, and other cities.

Currently, more than 50,000 commercial employees have arrived in rural areas to assist the people's communes in pushing the cotton sales movement to a climax.

Jinan, November 10 (By Telegraph) - The agricultural product procurement work in Shandong Province is advancing victoriously on the basis of the previous stage. The province is required to strive to complete 70% to 80% of the annual procurement tasks of cotton, tobacco, hemp, and oilseeds by November 15, and the remaining tasks will be completed by the end of November. These requirements were put forward at a telephone conference convened by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee on the evening of the 4th.

This telephone conference was specially convened to organize a greater upsurge in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. At the meeting, it was also required that all localities earnestly grasp the procurement, transportation, and organization of export materials. At the same time, it is also required to seize the procurement of some minor local and sideline products, export materials, and wild fibers and wild oilseeds. For export goods that are urgently needed, such as lace and straw braid, a certain amount of labor should also be arranged for production.

The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that to complete the above tasks, it is necessary to continuously overcome various ideas that hinder the progress of the movement, and combine with the specific conditions of the locality to put forward clear and specific task requirements, and actions must be rapid and timely. The financial and trade front must uniformly organize and mobilize all forces, so that business work can fully keep up with the requirements of the development of the movement, and ensure that the commune sells as much as it receives, sends as much as it receives, and receives whenever it is sent. Between the financial and trade departments, it is necessary to carry forward the communist spirit and promote the cooperative method of "grabbing everything when going out and dividing the family again when returning." To ensure the realization of the above requirements, the Provincial Party Committee decided to immediately launch a red flag competition movement of major inspection, inserting red flags, and launching satellites on the financial and trade front throughout the province. Now, a financial and trade work inspection group of more than a thousand people has been formed and set off on the 6th of this month to conduct cross-inspections by prefecture, exchange experiences with each other, and promote each other through comparison.

### 充分发动群众突击采收、交售、调运  农产品收购量猛升

    充分发动群众突击采收、交售、调运
    农产品收购量猛升
    江西接近完成全年计划  江苏棉花购得快运得快  山东开展大检查大竞赛
    据江西日报消息　江西省农产品采购运动已掀起高潮，收购量大大上升。全省已完成今年全年国家采购计划的92.9％，赣县、寻乌、龙南、安远、会昌、于都、广昌、崇义、萍乡九县和上饶市，已提前完成了全部农产品收购计划。另有三十四县分别完成了棉、烟、麻和生猪收购计划。全省外调计划也完成得好，生猪已完成年计划的153％，苎麻完成100％，黄麻完成91.4％，棉花完成80％。
    上述成绩的取得，主要是各地及时贯彻了中共中央、国务院和省委、省人委的指示，做到了党政领导同志亲自挂帅抓采购工作，运用大运动套小运动的方法，依靠和发动了广大群众突击采收、交售、调运，从而大大加快了收购进度。许多地区通过鸣放辩论，还大破了“当前劳动力紧张，就无法开展农产品采购工作”的悲观论调，通过发掘社会潜在的劳动力，全省组织了三十万到五十万劳动大军，经常围绕中心工作，趁空隙、抢时间，分期分批随时突击收购。
    许多地方的经验证明：只要加强领导，全面安排，挖掘劳动潜力，合理安排时间，在大搞钢铁和秋收秋种的同时，农产品的收购工作是可以结合进行的。以赣县为例，他们在10月15至21日的钢铁高产周中，超额完成生铁任务109.1％，10月27日以前又全部完成了秋收任务，而棉、麻、烟、茶、红瓜子等几项主要农产品的全年收购任务也超额完成了。
    本报南京10日电　大张旗鼓掀起群众性运动，江苏省购棉量猛升。全省自10月25日开展突击运动以来，平均日收量比过去多60％以上。本年度收购的棉花折成皮棉已有近二百万担，比去年同期增加达五倍。
    江苏省今年棉花大丰收，预计总产量可达八百万担，比去年增产一倍多。丰收给商业部门扩大收购带来了有利条件。但是前些时有些地区人民公社因钢铁生产、秋收、秋种紧张，没有妥善安排和抽出一定数量的劳力进行售棉工作，加之商业部门没有根据新的情况改变收购方法，购棉进度很慢，完成计划较差。在中共中央和国务院联合发出突击收购和调运农产品的指示后，中共江苏省各县县委会对前一阶段棉花收购工作进行了全面检查，要求各个人民公社在“元帅领先，先行突出，各项工作跟上”的原则下，统一安排劳力，钻农业生产空隙的缝子，开展群众性突击运动。并通过鸣放辩论，批判了商业部门在收购工作上的因循守旧、等客上门等右倾保守思想。这样，扭转了收购缓慢的局面，全省平均日收量从五万多担增加到八万多担。重点棉花产地的南通、盐城和苏州专区，由于大胆发动群众，依靠人民公社自行检验，自行过秤，自行打包，自行运输的群众路线的收购方法，都超额完成了10月份棉花收购计划。
    各地千方百计解决棉花收购量增加所带来的加工和运输方面的困难。苏州专区对棉花加工进行技术改革，提高台时产量；配备足够的人力，大力组织人力轧花车，全区10月下旬皮棉日产量一万四千担，比上旬和中旬增长56％。这个专区运用“五船”（拖驳、内河轮、农船、渔船、回空船）、车船并举、短途集中和长途运输相结合等办法，做到轧花厂不脱子棉，纱厂不脱皮棉，在10月份及时赶运了七十多万担皮棉，支持无锡、上海等市纺织工厂的生产。
    目前，五万多商业职工已经到达农村，协助人民公社把售棉运动推向高潮。
    本报济南10日电　山东省农产品采购工作正在前段胜利的基础上，乘胜猛进。要求全省在11月15日前，争取完成棉、烟、麻和油料全年收购任务的70％到80％，其余的任务在11月底全部完成。这些要求是中共山东省委在4日晚召开的电话会议上提出的。
    这次电话会议是专为组织一次更大的农副产品采购工作高潮召开的。会上，还要求各地认真抓好出口物资的收购、调运和组织出口工作。同时，对一些次要的土副产品、出口物资和野生纤维、野生油料等也要求抓紧收购。对于出口迫切需要的花边、草帽辫等也要安排一定的劳力进行生产。
    省委指出，要完成上述任务，必须不断克服障碍运动前进的各种思想，并结合当地具体情况，提出明确具体的任务要求，行动要迅速及时。财贸战线要把全部力量统一地组织调动起来，使业务工作完全跟上运动发展的要求，做到公社卖多少就接多少，送多少就收多少，什么时候送到什么时候接收。各财贸部门之间，要发扬共产主义精神，推广“出门一把抓，回来再分家”的协作方法。为保证实现上述要求，省委决定立即在全省范围内开展一个财贸战线上的大检查、插红旗、放卫星的红旗竞赛运动。现在，一个千余人的财贸工作检查团已经组成，并在本月6日出发，以专区为单位进行交叉检查，互相交流经验，互相评比促进。
