Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: To alleviate the strong condemnation of his fascist actions from public opinion, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi met with journalists on the 7th, desperately trying to defend his heinous conspiracy to extend the Diet session by illegal means in order to forcibly pass the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment." At the same time, according to Kyodo News, he also falsely accused the Japanese people's movement to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, which was launched to oppose his restoration of the police state and pursuit of war policies, of being related to the "international communist movement."

Under questioning from reporters, Nobusuke Kishi admitted that he had taken improper means to illegally extend the Diet session this time. However, he sophistically argued that these were "measures" that had to be taken for a "legitimate purpose." At the same time, Nobusuke Kishi tried his best to shirk his responsibility for this despicable behavior. He said that although he concurrently serves as Prime Minister and President of the Liberal Democratic Party, he cannot personally handle the work of the Diet.

Nobusuke Kishi attempted to slander the Japanese people's struggle against his series of reactionary policies, including the forced implementation of the "Performance Rating" system, the restoration of the police state, and the amendment of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to further tie Japan to the American war chariot. He insisted that these struggles "changed their original nature" and that he did not want these struggles to become a "political struggle" to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Liberal Democratic cabinet. He was very afraid of the Japanese people's support for the Socialist Party's struggle, and afraid of the Liberal Democratic Party's increasingly isolated position in the struggle. Therefore, he described the Japanese people's support for the Socialist Party as "driven by groups exerting pressure from the outside," and even as a "crisis of democracy."

When reporters questioned him about his attempts to formulate a series of reactionary laws related to the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," such as the formulation of the "Anti-Espionage Law," he admitted that he would take "certain public security countermeasures." He once again played the old tune of "preventing indirect aggression" and "safeguarding individual freedom" to cover up his militaristic aggression ambitions and his conspiracy to infringe upon the basic rights of the Japanese people.

Nobusuke Kishi is afraid of others exposing his ugly history of serving as a cabinet member in the Tojo cabinet and being a war criminal. He described the Japanese people's exposure of this sore as "malicious propaganda."

### 恢复警察国家阴谋欲盖弥彰  岸信介徒然为其恶行辩解

    恢复警察国家阴谋欲盖弥彰
    岸信介徒然为其恶行辩解
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介为了缓和舆论对他的法西斯行径的强烈谴责，在7日接见新闻记者，竭力为他使用非法手段延长国会会期，以便强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”的罪恶阴谋辩解。同时，据共同社透露，他还反诬日本人民为了反对他恢复警察国家和奉行战争政策而掀起的打倒岸信介内阁的运动同“国际共产主义运动”有关联。
    在记者们的责问下，岸信介承认他这次非法延长国会会期采取了不正当的手段。但是他诡辩说，这是为了“正当的目的”、“不得不”采取的“措施”。同时，岸信介还竭力推卸他对这种卑劣行为所负的责任。他说他虽然兼任首相和自由民主党的总裁，但是不能亲自处理国会的工作。
    岸信介力图诬蔑日本人民为了反对他的强制推行“勤务评定”制度、反对他恢复警察国家、反对他通过日美“安全条约”的修改而把日本进一步缚在美国战车上的一连串的反动政策的斗争，他硬说这些斗争“改变了原来的性质”，他不愿意这些斗争变成打倒岸信介自由民主党内阁的“政治斗争”。他非常害怕日本人民支持社会党所进行的斗争，害怕自由民主党在斗争中日益孤立的处境，于是他把日本人民对社会党的支持说成是“被外面施加压力的团体所推动”，甚至说成是“民主的危机”。
    当记者们质问他企图制订一连串同修改日美“安全条约”有关的反动法律，例如制订“防谍法”等的情况时，他承认他要采取“某种治安对策”。他再次弹起了“防止间接侵略”和“维护个人自由”的滥调，来掩盖他的军国主义侵略野心和侵犯日本人民基本权利的阴谋。
    岸信介忌讳别人揭发他的担任过东条内阁阁员、曾经是战犯的丑恶的历史，他把日本人民揭他这一疮疤说成是“恶意宣传”。
