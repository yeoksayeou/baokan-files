Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 1st: In southern China, a region traditionally considered coal-deficient, another high-yield coal production satellite has been launched. In Meixian County, Guangdong Province, 50,000 coal miners extracted 710,000 tons of coal in a single day, October 28th. This output is equivalent to one and a half times the total coal production of the county in the first nine months of this year.

　　This coal was extracted from the coal-rich Zhukeng Mountain using large-scale blasting methods. At 2:00 AM on the 28th, twenty-one blasting points set up on the coal mountain were detonated. After the surface layer of the coal mountain was blasted open, a thick coal seam 350 meters long and 150 meters wide was immediately revealed. The coal mining army immediately began clearing the loosened soil and rubble covering the coal seam, as well as the soil and rubble mixed within the coal seam, clearing a total of 23,000 cubic meters of mud and stone. The extracted coal was inspected and accepted by Sun Jingye, the First Secretary of the Meixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Peng Dumin and Zhang Jiannan, Deputy Commissioners of the Shantou Prefecture, and local experts, totaling 710,000 tons, all of which is anthracite coal.

　　The main reason for the success of Meixian County's coal production satellite is that the Meixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has greatly strengthened its leadership by treating coal production as an important part of current iron smelting production. The First Secretary of the County Committee took personal command, and workers, peasants, soldiers, students, residents, and cadres were all mobilized. Everyone looked for methods and ideas, and finally created this record of high crude coal production.

    梅县一天采煤达七十一万吨
    新华社广州1日电　在一向被认为缺煤的祖国南方，又有一颗原煤高产卫星上天。广东省梅县五万名采煤大军，在10月28日一天采煤七十一万吨。这一产量相当于这个县今年头九个月总采煤量的一倍半。
    这些煤炭是用大爆破的方法，在煤藏丰富的柱坑山上采出的。28日早晨两点钟，设在这座煤山上的二十一个爆破点爆炸了。煤山表层炸开以后，立即显出了一片长三百五十公尺、宽一百五十公尺的深厚煤层。采煤大军立即开始清除煤层外被炸松的泥土和碎石，以及杂在煤层中的泥土和碎石，一共清出了二万三千立方公尺的泥、石。清理出的煤，经过中共梅县县委第一书记孙敬业、汕头专署副专员彭笃民、张建南及当地土专家等多人的验收，共为七十一万吨，都是无烟煤。
    梅县产煤卫星能够上天，主要原因是中共梅县县委把煤炭生产当作当前炼铁生产的重要部分，大大加强了领导。县委第一书记亲自挂帅，工人、农民、战士、学生、居民和干部都动员起来。大家找窍门，想办法，终于创造了这次原煤高产纪录。
