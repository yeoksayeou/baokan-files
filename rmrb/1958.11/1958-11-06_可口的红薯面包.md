Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th - More than twenty counties in Henan Province have achieved sweet potato bread production. Out of the more than 29,000 public canteens in the Shangqiu area, more than 25,000 are eating delicious sweet potato bread. Zhongmu County has established 381 bread ovens, each producing more than 500 jin of sweet potato bread per day. The bread baked by the public canteens in Huaiyang County includes date paste fillings, savory flavors, sweet flavors, salty flavors, and some are made with eggs, sugar, and oil.

Sweet potato bread production is a creative achievement made by public canteens throughout Henan Province under the slogan of "refining coarse grains."

In making bread, all localities thoroughly implemented the principle of "mass appeal." About 80% of the baked bread is sweet potato, and about 20% is corn flour, bean flour, and millet flour. The production method is: steam the sweet potatoes, peel them, and knead them into sweet potato paste, add some alkali, and then mix with the mixed flour to ferment. After fermentation, form the dough into bread and bake it in the oven, using the same baking method as for regular bread. Adding alkali to the sweet potato paste is to neutralize the acidity in the sweet potatoes, avoiding excessive stomach acid after eating the bread. The sweet potato bread made by Shuangba Commune in Shangqiu County, using 85% sweet potatoes, 15% corn flour, 2.5 jin of white sugar, and seven qian of saccharin per hundred jin, costs only eight fen per jin. Because sweet potato bread is sweet and delicious, low in cost, and suitable for long-term storage, it is very popular among the masses.

    可口的红薯面包
    新华社郑州5日电　河南省已有二十多个县实现了红薯面包化。商丘专区二万九千多个公共食堂中，就有二万五千多个食堂吃上了可口的红薯面包。中牟县建立了三百八十一个面包炉，每炉每天生产红薯面包五百多斤。淮阳县公社食堂烤成的面包有枣泥馅的、五香的、甜的、咸的、还有加鸡蛋、糖、油做成的。
    红薯面包化，这是河南省各地公社食堂在“粗粮细吃”口号下，取得的一项创造性的成就。
    各地做面包时，都彻贯了“大众化”的原则。烤成的面包中，有80％左右是红薯，20％左右是玉米面、豆面和小米面。制作方法是：把红薯蒸熟去皮揉成红薯泥后，放些碱进去，再和杂面掺在一起发酵。发酵后，团成面包放到炉中烘烤，烤法与一般面包的烤法相同。在红薯泥里放碱，是为了和红薯中的酸性中和，避免面包吃到肚里产生过多的胃酸。商丘县双八公社用85％的红薯、15％的玉米面和每百斤掺二斤半白糖、七钱糖精制成的红薯面包，每斤成本只合八分钱。由于红薯面包香甜可口，成本低，又适于长久储存，因此很受群众欢迎。
