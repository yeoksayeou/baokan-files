    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 22nd: Tokyo News: Amidst the resolute struggle of the Japanese people, Nobusuke Kishi, the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Prime Minister of Japan, has been forced to make some concessions to domestic public opinion and has agreed to temporarily shelve his "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" as a bill "under deliberation but not concluded."
    The meeting between Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, and Kishi Nobusuke today in Tokyo was held in accordance with the agreement reached in the four-person meeting between Socialist Party Secretary-General Inajiro Asanuma and Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Masajiro Kawashima yesterday. Asanuma and Kawashima also attended today's meeting. A joint communique issued after the meeting between the two party leaders stated that both sides agreed to treat the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" as a bill under deliberation but not concluded; confirmed the validity of the Kishi Nobusuke group's decision to extend the extraordinary session of the Diet, the House of Representatives will naturally adjourn after the extended session, and the House of Councillors will adjourn after deliberating on the supplementary budget and related bills; regarding the issue of the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives resigning to take responsibility, both sides tacitly agreed that after the situation in the Diet returns to normal, the Speaker and Vice-Speaker will automatically resign, and both sides also agreed that the Speaker and Vice-Speaker should disaffiliate from their parties in the future.
    The Socialist Party had originally advocated that the Kishi Nobusuke group should acknowledge the invalidity of the decision to extend the session of the extraordinary Diet, that the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" should be scrapped, and that the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives should resign to take responsibility. It advocated that only after these three conditions were met would it agree to restore the normal state of the Diet.
    Local Japanese newspaper commentators believe that the agreement reached by Kishi Nobusuke and Suzuki on this issue today indicates the failure of the government and the ruling party. However, the national public still expresses dissatisfaction because the Socialist Party has abandoned its original demands and compromised with the government.

    在日本人民坚决反对声中
    岸信介被迫暂搁“警职法”
    社会党领袖与岸信介会谈达成协议
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎和执政的自由民主党总裁、日本首相岸信介今天在东京举行了会谈。在日本人民坚决的斗争中，岸信介被迫向国内舆论作了一些让步，同意把他的“警察官职务执行法修正案”作为“审议未了”的法案暂时搁置起来。
    这次两党领袖的会谈，是根据社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎和自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎等昨天举行的两党四人会谈中达成的协议而举行的。浅沼和川岛也出席了今天的会谈。两党领袖会谈后发表的联合公报说，双方同意把“警察官职务执行法修正案”作为审议未了的法案；确认岸信介集团关于延长国会临时会期的决定有效，众议院在延长会期后自然休会，参议院在审议完补充预算案以及有关法案后休会；关于众议院正副议长引咎辞职的问题，双方默契，在国会情况恢复正常以后，正副议长自动辞职，双方同时协议，今后正副议长要摆脱党籍。
    社会党原来曾经主张，要岸信介集团承认延长国会临时会议会期的决定无效，“警察官职务执行法修正案”作废，众议院正副议长引咎辞职。它主张满足了这三个条件，才同意恢复国会的正常状态。
    日本的地方报纸评论员认为，岸信介和铃木今天就这个问题达成的协议，表明了政府和执政党的失败。然而全国公众仍然表示不满，因为社会党放弃了自己原有的要求，同政府进行了妥协。
