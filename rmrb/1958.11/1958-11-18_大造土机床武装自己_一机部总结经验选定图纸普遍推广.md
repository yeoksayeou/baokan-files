Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: The First Ministry of Machine Building recently convened an on-the-spot experience exchange meeting on earth-method machine tools in East China, summarizing and exchanging many valuable experiences in manufacturing earth-method machine tools and using earth methods to manufacture machine tools. The representatives attending the meeting included factory directors, technicians, and workers from machinery factories and people's commune agricultural tool repair stations in six provinces and cities in East China. Representatives from ten provinces and autonomous regions, including Hebei, Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, also participated.

Since the beginning of this year, the rapid increase in the demand for machine tools has come from two aspects: first, after the nationwide campaign to run the iron and steel industry, the need to manufacture equipment for smelting, steel rolling, mining, power stations, transportation, and other equipment has increased rapidly; second, the agricultural great leap forward, and the rapid development of rural people's communes, requires machine tools to manufacture and repair machinery for farmland irrigation, deep plowing, harvesting, transportation, and other purposes. At present, many regions have built many machinery factory buildings, but there is a lack of machine tools; in some places, farmers want to repair agricultural tools, but there are no local machinery stations. Therefore, producing more machine tool equipment in the shortest possible time has become the most arduous task of the current machine tool industry. Since the beginning of this year, many machinery factories in East China and other regions have mobilized the masses, broken superstitions, and self-reliantly manufactured many earth-method machine tools and used earth methods to manufacture many new machine tools. The summarization, improvement, and comprehensive promotion of these experiences have opened up a broad road for the widespread development of the machine tool industry.

However, some people still hold mysterious views on manufacturing machine tools and lack confidence in mobilizing the masses to manufacture machine tools themselves. Some people also regard earth-method machine tools as a transitional and backward method to solve temporary difficulties. Therefore, some factories are still reaching out to the state for machine tools and waiting for allocation from higher authorities. The many experiences exchanged at this meeting refuted these conditional theories and the attitude of reaching out. The many experiences introduced by various regions of starting from scratch and self-reliantly developing earth-method machine tools have been particularly valued by the representatives. Many factories in the Fuyang Special Zone of Anhui Province had only dozens of dilapidated machine tools last year. This year, based on the need to establish an agricultural machinery network in the special zone, the local Party committee launched a major debate among the masses on whether they could manufacture machine tools themselves. In the debate, the workers broke superstitions and manufactured more than 5,000 machine tools in half a year. When manufacturing machine tools, some factories did not have a planer for machining flat surfaces, so they modified the carpenter's plane and used manual planing; without a slotting machine to make gears, they used hacksaws and files to make them. The machine tools they made armed many machinery factories and agricultural tool repair stations of people's communes. The Xiamen First Machinery Factory in Fujian Province was originally a handicraft cooperative making iron scales and wooden steelyards. Since August, with the assistance of various parties, they have also made thirty-four machine tools.

The experiences introduced by many representatives also show that manufacturing machine tools with earth methods is not only easy to manufacture, which can be widely developed and rapidly develop the mechanical industry, but also can create new machine tools from earth. In June, the Shanghai Zheng Xingtai Auto Parts Factory received the task of manufacturing important parts for the "Red Flag" large-scale tractor. These parts have special specifications and high precision. The factory did not have special machine tools, so the workers designed and manufactured them themselves. They built seventeen earth-method machine tools in just forty days, equipping a flow-line workshop, and the production efficiency was increased by more than twenty times compared with the trial production, and some reached about seventy times. The representatives from various regions were greatly inspired after visiting these factories.

During the meeting, the First Ministry of Machine Building also summarized the manufacturing experience of sixty-three kinds of earth-method machine tools and earth-method equipment, made drawings, and distributed them to representatives from various regions.

    大造土机床武装自己
    一机部总结经验选定图纸普遍推广
    据新华社上海16日电　第一机械工业部最近在上海召开了华东地区土机床经验交流现场会议，总结和交流了制造土机床和用土法制造机床的许多宝贵经验。参加会议的代表有华东地区六个省市的机械厂和人民公社农具修配站的厂长、技术人员和工人。河北、河南、广东、广西、甘肃、宁夏等十个省、自治区也有代表参加。
    今年以来，机床需要量的迅速增长来自两个方面：一是全民大办钢铁工业以后，制造冶炼、轧钢、矿山、电站、交通运输等设备的需要迅速增加；一是农业大跃进，农村人民公社迅速发展以后，农田灌溉、深耕、收割、运输等机械都需要有机床去制造和修理。目前许多地区盖了许多机械厂的厂房，苦无机床；有些地方农民要修农具，当地没有机械站。因此，在最短的时间内生产出更多的机床设备已成为当前机床工业最艰巨的任务。华东和其他地区许多机械厂今年以来发动群众，打破迷信，自力更生地制造了许多土机床和用土办法制造了许多新机床。这些经验的总结提高和全面推广，对机床工业遍地开花开辟了一条广阔的道路。
    但是，还有一部分人对于制造机床存在着神秘观点，对于发动群众自己制造机床缺乏信心。也有些人把土机床看成是过渡性的、解决一时困难的落后办法。因此有的工厂现在还伸手向国家要机床、坐等上级调拨。这次会议交流的许多经验，驳倒了这些条件论、伸手派。各地介绍的许多平地起家、自力更生大搞土机床的经验，特别受到代表们的重视。安徽省阜阳专区许多工厂去年只有几十台破旧机床，今年根据专区建立农业机械网的需要，当地党委发动群众展开了一场能不能自己制造机床的大辩论。工人们在辩论中打破了迷信，半年内造出了五千多台机床。有的工厂制造机床时，车平面没有刨床，就把木匠用的刨子改装，用人工刨；没有插床做齿轮，就用钢锯、锉刀来做。它们做成的机床武装了许多机械厂和人民公社的农具修配站。福建省厦门第一机械厂原来是一个做铁磅、木杆秤的手工业合作社，在8月份以来，他们在各方面的协助下，也做出了三十四台机床。
    许多代表介绍的经验还说明：用土办法制造机床不仅制造容易，可以遍地开花、迅速发展机械工业，而且能够土中出洋，创造出新机床。上海郑兴泰汽车配件厂6月份接到制造“红旗牌”大型拖拉机重要部件的任务，这些部件规格特殊，精密度很高，厂里没有专用机床，工人们就自己设计制造。他们在短短的四十天内造出了十七台土机床，装备了一个流水作业车间，生产效率比试制时提高二十多倍，高的达到七十倍左右。各地代表参观了这些工厂后，都得到了很大的启发。
    会议期间，第一机械工业部还归纳了六十三种土机床、土设备的制造经验，制成图纸分发给各地代表。
