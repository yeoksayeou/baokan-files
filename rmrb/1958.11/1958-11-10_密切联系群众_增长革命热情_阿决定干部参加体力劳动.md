Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 8th November: November 8th marks the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian Labour Party. On this day, the Central Committee of the Albanian Labour Party announced a resolution on the participation of cadres nationwide in physical labor. This resolution was adopted by the Labour Party Central Committee at its recent plenary session.

The resolution stipulates that all staff of Albanian state organs, intellectuals, cadres of party organs, and mass organizations, including senior cadres of party and state organs, except for those who are elderly or ill and unable to participate in physical labor, must spend at least one month each year participating in physical labor.

The resolution states that the targets of labor will be jointly determined by local Party committees and district executive committees. The Central Committee of the Labour Party calls on Party and government organs at all levels to actively organize labor, especially voluntary labor in the region, such as road construction, tree planting, land reclamation, pasture improvement, house building, and cultural center construction.

The resolution points out that the decision for cadres to participate in physical labor has enormous educational and political significance. It will enable cadres to better connect with the realities of life and socialist construction, strengthen ties with the people, and learn from the masses' struggle experience. Physical labor will be an important factor in increasing revolutionary and labor enthusiasm and eliminating bureaucracy and remnants of bourgeois ideology.

The resolution also calls on cadres nationwide, especially Party members, to actively set an example.
