A new product has been developed by Beijing's silk industry, named Feili Silk. It is woven from locally reeled silk.

Clever silk workers utilize the uneven thickness of locally reeled silk to weave a silk fabric that features irregular bumps on the surface, giving it a unique style. This product is very popular among residents of Southeast Asia and other regions, and has already begun to be exported in large quantities.
