    Be Sure to Manage the Canteen Well
    Cheng Pu
    A large number of rural public canteens have been established. They have become an important material foundation for the militarization of rural organization, the combatization of action, and the collectivization of life. However, at present, some rural cadres are unwilling to manage the canteens. There are various reasons for their unwillingness, such as some people saying that this is a "trivial matter of life," and that whether it is managed well or badly does not matter much. Articles published in this newspaper a few days ago criticized this view. In addition, some people have another saying: The people's commune implements a grain supply system, and eating is free of charge, so the commune members do not have to worry about eating. There is no need to manage it anymore. In the eyes of these people, it seems that as long as the grain supply system is implemented, everything will be fine, and leading cadres do not need to worry about the masses' eating problems anymore. Is the problem really that simple?
    No one denies that it is an unprecedented event that everyone has food to eat after the implementation of the grain supply system. The broad masses of peasants do welcome this very much. However, as leaders, we must not be satisfied with this. After the implementation of the grain supply system and the establishment of public canteens, the responsibilities of the leaders have not been reduced, but increased. In the past, each family arranged everything in their own small kitchen, and whether they ate well or badly was their own business. Now, with the establishment of public canteens, the responsibility for arranging the masses' meals falls on the shoulders of the leaders. How can the rural Party organizations and the leading cadres of the people's communes not care? Not only must they care, but they must also manage them well. The sign of managing the public canteen well is to ensure that everyone eats their fill and eats well. Eating one's fill and eating well are inseparable. If you don't eat well, it will be difficult to eat your fill. For example, if a public canteen provides very poor food, often serving undercooked rice, cold rice, or simply asking people to drink plain boiled water and eat steamed buns. In such a situation, people will not only not eat well, but whether they can eat their fill is also a problem. How can such a public canteen take root among the masses? To make the public canteen take root among the masses, it is necessary to make the masses feel that eating in the public canteen is more comfortable and satisfactory than eating at home. Eating is free of charge, which is the most advanced distribution system, but the peasant masses measure any system not according to the provisions of the system, but according to the results of its implementation. Only by running the public canteen well, so that the peasants can truly see its benefits, can they sincerely acknowledge the superiority of the public canteen and the grain supply system.
    In the depths of the minds of some comrades who do not care about the lives of the masses, there may still be some "benevolence" viewpoints at work. They have such thoughts: "How many people used to worry about eating, and how many people begged relatives and friends because they had no food to eat; now that the grain supply system is implemented and food is given for free, are you still not satisfied?" This is very undesirable. The reason why the peasants can enjoy the welfare of free food today is by no means due to the "benevolence" of anyone, but due to the hard work and hard work of the peasant masses under the leadership of the Party, which has resulted in a large increase in grain production. Therefore, free food must not become a reason for leading cadres to be irresponsible and uncaring about public canteens. Since the peasants have paid so much labor to create today's material conditions for free food, they have the right to demand to eat better within the limits of what is permitted. If they criticize because they do not eat well, then the leading cadres should accept the criticism of the masses and strive to run this collective welfare undertaking well.
    Today, the lives of the peasants have been collectivized, and collectivized life is closely linked to collectivized production. The better the collective life is organized, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses for production, and the stronger the organization and discipline of the masses in labor, which will result in an increasingly rapid increase in overall labor productivity. Therefore, whether to care about the lives of the masses and whether to earnestly organize collective life is a matter of the mass viewpoint and also a matter of the production viewpoint. Today, in the new situation where rural production and construction are leaping forward at a rapid pace, rural Party organizations and leading comrades of the people's communes must broaden their horizons and look at today's peasant life problems from a developmental perspective, and not continue to use past standards to cope with today's new needs.

    一定要管好食堂
    程浦
    大量的农村公共食堂举办起来了，它们已经成了农村的组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化的重要物质基础。但是，目前在农村干部中还有些人对办食堂这件事不大愿意管。不愿意管的理由有种种，比如有些人说这是“生活小事”，办好办坏无关大体。本报前些天发表的文章中曾经批判过这种看法。除此之外，有些人还有另一种说法：人民公社实行了粮食供给制，吃饭不要钱了，社员不愁吃饭了，用不着再去管了。在这些人看来，似乎只要实行了粮食供给制，就万事大吉，就不用领导干部再为群众的吃饭问题操心了。问题真的是这样简单吗？
    谁也不否认，实行粮食供给制以后，人人有饭吃，这是破天荒的大事。广大农民也的确十分欢迎这件事。但是，从领导者来说，决不能就此满足。实行了粮食供给制，办起了公共食堂，领导者的责任不是减轻了，而是加重了。从前是每个家庭自己安排自己小厨房里的一切，吃好吃坏，是每个家庭自己的事。现在，成立了公共食堂，安排群众吃饭的事情的责任就落到领导者的肩上了。农村党组织和人民公社的领导干部怎么可以不管呢？不但要管，而且一定要管好，管好公共食堂的标志，是让大家吃饱和吃好。吃饱和吃好是分不开的，吃不好，也就难以吃得饱。比如有一个公共食堂把伙食办得很糟，经常让人们吃夹生饭，吃冷饭，或者只叫人们喝着白开水啃馍馍。这样的情况下，人们不但吃不好，能否吃得饱，也是个问题。这样的公共食堂怎么能在群众中生根呢？要使公共食堂在群众中生根，就必须做到使群众感到在公共食堂吃饭，比在家里吃饭更舒服，更满意。吃饭不要钱，是一种最先进的分配制度，但是农民群众衡量任何制度。都不是根据制度的条文，而是根据实行的结果来评判的。只有把公共食堂办好了，让农民真正看到它的好处了，他们才能心悦诚服地承认公共食堂和粮食供给制的优越性。
    在某些不关心群众生活的同志的思想深处，可能还有点“恩赐”观点在作怪。他们有这样的想法：“从前多少人为了吃饭问题而忧愁，多少人因为没饭吃而求亲告友；如今实行了粮食供给制，白给饭吃，你们还不知足吗？”这是很要不得的。今天农民所以能享到吃饭不要钱的福利，决不是由于什么人的“恩赐”，而是由于农民群众自己在党的领导下猛干苦干，使粮食产量大量增加的结果。因此，吃饭不要钱这一点，决不能成为领导干部可以对公共食堂不负责任，不操心的理由。农民既然付出了那么多的劳动才创造了今天这个吃饭不要钱的物质条件，他们就有权利要求在条件许可范围内吃得更好些。如果他们因为吃得不好而提出批评，那么领导干部就理应接受群众的批评，努力把这项集体福利事业办好。
    今天，农民的生活已经集体化了，集体化的生活同集体化的生产紧密相连。集体生活组织得越好，群众的生产劲头就越大，群众在劳动中的组织性、纪律性也就越强，结果就会使整个劳动生产率越来越快地提高。所以，是否关心群众生活，能不能认真地组织集体生活，是群众观点问题，也是生产观点问题。在今天，在农村生产建设正在一日千里地向前跃进的新形势下，农村党组织和人民公社的领导同志一定要把眼光放远些，用发展的观点来看待今天的农民生活问题，而不能老拿过去的标准来应付今天的新需要。
