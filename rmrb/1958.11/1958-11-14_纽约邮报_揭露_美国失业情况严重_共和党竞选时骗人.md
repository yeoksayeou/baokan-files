Xinhua News Agency, New York, 12th: The "New York Post" published an editorial on the 9th entitled "Now We Can Talk," exposing the Republican government's deception of the people on the issue of unemployment.

The editorial said: Now that the election campaign is over, the government apparently believes that it is no longer important to reveal some of the less attractive truths about our economy. Until November 4, the situation depicted by Republican speakers was filled with optimism. Every reduction in unemployment figures was hailed as a victory for Republican wisdom and courage over the opposition's doubts and fears. They assured us that the unemployment problem would soon be a thing of the past.

The editorial said that Ewan Clague, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor, leaked the secret of the unemployment situation forty-eight hours after election day.

Clague admitted that from now until midwinter, "total employment in the economy will decline significantly, and unemployment will increase." He also said that even if business conditions continue to recover, "the reduction in employment" will still be "significant."

    “纽约邮报”揭露
    美国失业情况严重  共和党竞选时骗人
    新华社12日讯　纽约消息：“纽约邮报”9日刊载了一篇题为“现在可以谈出来了”的社论，揭露共和党政府在失业问题上欺骗人民。
    社论说：竞选运动既已结束，政府显然认为，透露一些有关我国经济的不那么吸引人的真实情况已不要紧了。直到11月4日为止，共和党演说家所描绘的情况充溢着乐观的情绪。失业数字的每一次减少都被欢呼是共和党的智慧和勇气对反对党的怀疑和恐惧的胜利。他们向我们保证说，失业问题很快就会成为过去的事情。
    社论说，劳工部劳工统计局局长尤安·克拉格在选举日后四十八小时就泄露了失业情况的秘密。
    克拉格承认，从现在起直到仲冬，“在经济方面总的就业人数将大大下降，失业人数将增加”。他又说，即使商业情况继续恢复，“就业人数的减少”仍然“很大”。
