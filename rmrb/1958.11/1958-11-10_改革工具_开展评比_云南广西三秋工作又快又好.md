Yunnan and Guangxi Achieve Fast and Good Results in the Three Autumn Harvests

    (Our report) Yunnan Province has adopted a method combining normal production with a shock campaign. Since October 30th, it has organized an unprecedented autumn harvest and planting shock movement. The labor force投入into autumn harvest and planting has increased to over six million people. The pace of the autumn harvest has rapidly increased from around one million mu per day to over two million six hundred thousand mu per day, and the pace of autumn planting has also reached nearly one million mu per day. Forty million mu of major spring crops have achieved "nine yellow ten harvests, every grain returns home," and more than twenty million mu of minor spring crops have undergone a major revolution in minor spring production, transforming from not plowing, harrowing, fertilizing, or irrigating in previous years to deep plowing, fine harrowing, heavy fertilization, and heavy irrigation.
    In the high tide of the autumn harvest and planting, all localities have implemented the idea of both speed and quality into the actions of the masses. The masses have created experiences such as ensuring the sickle for cutting millet is sharp, the hand grips tightly, the knife is held flat, and only the upper part moves to reduce scattering. Some counties have implemented a parallel assembly line operation method of cutting, transporting, threshing, and storing simultaneously, which has reduced the phenomenon of grain scattering compared to previous years. Party committees at all levels, counties and communes, have universally organized mass quality inspections. In the inspection and evaluation, Qujing Prefecture promoted the experience of "three no departures," meaning: no departure if the ideology is not clear, no departure if the measures are not detailed, and no departure if the backward state is not changed. Yiliang, Yuxi and other counties promoted a system of three inspections per day, checking attendance in the morning, work efficiency at noon, and quality in the evening, ensuring that each plot is planted, inspected, and immediately remedied if it does not meet the requirements. So far, the vast majority of the more than 31 million mu of major spring grain crops harvested and the more than 13 million mu of minor spring crops planted throughout the province are of good quality.

    (Our report) The autumn harvest work in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is proceeding both quickly and well. In recent days, more than 3.5 million laborers across the region have been working day and night to harvest mid-season and late rice, with a daily harvest progress of one million mu. By the 3rd, half of the mid-season and late rice had been harvested.
    This year, the planting area of mid-season and late rice in the autonomous region has greatly increased compared to last year, and it is generally characterized by medium-sized plants, dense planting, good seedlings, and abundant grains, so the workload of harvesting is one to four times greater than last year. Therefore, leaders at all levels in the autonomous region have mobilized all men, women, old, young, full labor force and partial labor force to participate in the autumn harvest. After ideological mobilization and organizational mobilization in Yulin Prefecture, the labor force participating in the autumn harvest has increased from hundreds of thousands of people to more than 1.3 million people now.
    In the harvesting process, all localities have universally adopted a combination of large-scale corps coordinated operations and contracted responsibility system by area to greatly accelerate the harvesting speed. After Tiandeng County adopted this method, the harvesting efficiency doubled and the quality was also guaranteed. Counties such as Quanxian, Guixian, and Baise have also classified and ranked the rice seedlings according to their maturity, distinguishing between urgent and less urgent, and carried out mutual support between communes and between mountainous areas and plains.
    While carrying out the great harvest shock, great collaboration, and great competition, all localities in the autonomous region have also launched a major reform of autumn harvest tools. As of the 4th, more than 440,000 harvesting machines and more than 80,000 threshing machines have been manufactured throughout the region. Yulin Prefecture's tool reform is fast and plentiful, and the entire area has achieved harvesting toolization. The Dongfanghong People's Commune in Liujiang County has increased production efficiency three times by using harvesting machines compared to using old sickles.

    改革工具　开展评比
    云南广西三秋工作又快又好
    本报讯　云南省采取正常生产与突击运动相结合的方法，从10月30日开始组织了一个规模空前的秋收秋种突击运动，全省投入秋收秋种的劳动大军已增加到六百多万人，秋收进度由每天百万亩左右迅速上升到每天二百六十多万亩，秋种进度也达到每天近百万亩。四千万亩大春作物作到“九黄十收、颗粒还家”，两千多万亩小春作物由往年的不犁、不耙、不施肥、不灌溉，变成深耕、细耙、大肥、大水，进行了小春生产的大革命。
    在秋收秋种高潮中，各地都把既要快又要好的思想贯彻到群众的行动中去。群众创造了割谷子镰刀要快，手要捏紧，刀要放平，上动下不动等减少抛撒的经验。有的县实行了边割边运边打边藏平行流水作业法，抛撒粮食的现象比往年减少。各地、县委和公社党委都普遍组织了群众性的质量大检查。曲靖专区在检查评比中推行了“三不走”的经验，即：思想不通不走，措施不细致不走，落后面貌不改变不走。宜良，玉溪等县推行了一日三查制，每天早查出勤、午查工效、晚查质量，做到种一块，查一块，不合要求的立即补救。到目前为止，全省已经收割的三千一百多万亩大春粮食作物和种下的一千三百多万亩小春作物，绝大部分质量良好。（张廷干）
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区秋收工作进行得既快又好。连日来，全区投入中、晚稻收割的三百五十多万劳动大军，披星戴月，每天收割进度达一百万亩，到3日止，中、晚稻收割一半。
    自治区今年中、晚稻种植面积较去年大大增多，又普遍是中株密植、禾好谷多，收割工作量比去年多一倍到四倍。因此，自治区各级领导在秋收工作中，把一切男女老少全劳动力、半劳动力都组织起来。玉林专区经过思想发动和组织动员以后，参加秋收的劳动力由几十万人增加到现在的一百三十万多人。
    在收割过程中，各地普遍采取大兵团协同作战和分片包干、建立责任制相结合的办法，使收割速度大大加快。天等县采取这一办法后，收割效率提高一倍，质量也得到了保证。全县、贵县、百色等县还根据禾苗成熟情况分类排队，分别先后缓急，开展公社与公社之间、山区平原互相支援。
    在收割大突击、大协作、大评比的同时，自治区各地还开展了秋收工具大改革。到4日止，全区已制成收割器四十四万多架，打谷机八万多架。玉林专区工具改革又多又快，全区已实现了收割工具化。柳江县东方红人民公社使用收割器比用旧镰刀收割生产效率提高三倍。
