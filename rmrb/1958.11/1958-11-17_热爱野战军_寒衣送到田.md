According to the Henan Daily News: The members of the Xiatang Branch of the People's Commune in Lushan County, Henan Province, have all put on cotton clothes, covered themselves with cotton quilts, and put on new shoes.

Since last winter, the members of this commune have been engaged in the ever-increasing great leap forward movement in industrial and agricultural production. Especially after the people's communes were established, the broad masses of commune members were overjoyed and worked even harder, fighting day and night in the mountains and fields, selflessly working to achieve a double bumper harvest of steel and grain. In such a massive and comprehensive great leap forward, some commune members did not have time to prepare winter clothes, quilts, shoes, and socks. Although the commune has established sewing factories and shoe factories, they are not large enough to meet the needs of all commune members. According to a survey last month, 7,356 people in the commune had not prepared winter clothes.

The commune's Party committee believes that solving the problem of winter clothing is not only an urgent demand of the masses, but also closely related to further improving industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, they loudly put forward the slogan of "Fighting hard for seven days and nights to break through the winter clothing barrier" and took effective measures in a timely manner: 1. Organize women's semi-labor and auxiliary labor forces to concentrate on dismantling, washing, and mending winter clothes, and rushing to make shoes and socks. In terms of dismantling, washing, and mending clothes, they are divided into four groups, adopting an assembly line operation method of dismantling, washing, and making at the same time, making and sending items according to the degree of urgency, and delivering winter clothes to needy commune members in a timely manner; 2. Organize female comrades from administrative organs, commerce, banks, and other departments to go to various teams under the unified leadership of the Party committee, cooperate with all people who can dismantle, wash, and mend winter clothes, and carry out the "Breakthrough Winter Clothing Barrier" movement with a spirit of hard work to ensure the completion of the task in seven days; 3. Give full play to the role of sewing factories and shoe factories, put forward the slogan of "Tools are not idle," organize all employees to operate in shifts, and rush to make them day and night. After seven days and nights of hard work, 16,137 pieces of old cotton clothes were dismantled, washed, and mended, 2,286 pieces of new cotton clothes were rushed to be made, 1,150 quilts were dismantled, washed and added to, and 11,640 pairs of shoes were made, so that all commune members of the commune put on cotton clothes, covered themselves with cotton quilts, and put on shoes.

After the problems of clothing, quilts, and shoes for the members of the Xiatang branch were solved, their enthusiasm for labor became even higher. The labor army fighting on the steel construction site issued a majestic oath: "Continue to work hard and ensure that the steel satellite does not fall." The commune members fighting on the agricultural front have expressed their determination to do a good job in agricultural production and ensure that next year's wheat satellite goes to heaven.

    热爱野战军　寒衣送到田
    据河南日报消息　河南鲁山县人民公社下汤分社社员都穿上了棉衣，盖上了棉被，穿上了新鞋。
    这个社的社员们，从去冬以后就投身于日益高涨的工农业生产大跃进运动中，特别是人民公社化以后，广大社员欢欣鼓舞，干劲更大，日夜奋战在高山、田野，为争取钢铁、粮食双丰收而忘我地劳动。在这样声势浩大的全面大跃进中，有些社员过冬的衣服、被子、鞋、袜来不及准备。公社虽然建立了缝纫厂、制鞋厂，但规模不大，还不能满足全体社员的需要。据上月了解，全社还有七千三百五十六人没有准备过冬的衣服。
    社党委认为解决寒衣问题不仅是群众的迫切要求，而且和进一步搞好工农业生产有着密切关系。因而，他们响亮地提出了“苦战七昼夜，突破寒衣关”的口号，及时地采取了有效措施：一、把妇女半劳力和辅助劳力组织起来，集中拆洗、缝补寒衣，赶制鞋袜。在拆洗缝补衣服方面分为四个组，采取边拆、边洗、边做的流水作业方法，根据轻重缓急，做一件送一件，及时把寒衣送到缺衣社员手里；二、把行政机关、商业、银行等部门中的女同志组织起来，在党委统一领导下，分赴各队，协同一切能够拆洗缝补寒衣的人，以苦战精神开展“突破寒衣关”运动，保证七天完成任务；三、充分发挥缝纫厂、制鞋厂的作用，提出“工具不闲”的口号，组织所有职工换班操作，昼夜不息地突击赶制。经过七昼夜奋战，拆洗缝补旧棉衣一万六千一百三十七件，赶制新棉衣二千二百八十六件，拆洗和添置被子一千一百五十条，做鞋一万一千六百四十双，使全社社员都穿上了棉衣，盖上了棉被，穿上了鞋子。
    下汤分社社员们的衣、被、鞋子问题解决后，劳动热情更加高昂。奋战在钢铁工地上的劳动大军发出雄伟的誓言：“继续大干苦战，保证钢铁卫星不落。”战斗在农业战线上的社员们，纷纷表示要把农业生产搞好，保证明年小麦卫星上天。
