Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Under the slogan of "All Treasures Return Home," Guizhou Province has launched a mass movement to collect mountain products. People's communes everywhere are collecting, processing, and selling to the state as they go. According to incomplete statistics, from November 1st to 23rd, purchasing departments have spent more than 50 million yuan in cash to purchase mountain products such as tung oil seeds, tea seeds, castor beans, and raw lacquer.

Since early November, various areas of Guizhou Province have made unified arrangements for the collection and purchase of mountain products. To date, Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture and Shuicheng, Yanhe, Qianxi and other counties have completed or basically completed the harvesting of various mountain products.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: After the basic completion of autumn plowing and planting, Lushan County in Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province, organized members of all ethnic groups to vigorously develop sideline production.

Lushan County is one of the main areas inhabited by the Miao people. This year's agriculture has achieved a bumper harvest, but the commune's cash income is not high. Therefore, after the basic completion of autumn plowing and planting, the Lushan County Party Committee quickly arranged labor and developed various sideline productions with local characteristics. The County Party Committee appointed the secretary in charge of finance and trade and industry to take charge, and the Party Committee secretaries of each district and commune were also specifically responsible for the leadership of sideline production. According to the local situation of many mountains and coal, the communes first organized more than 5,800 people to mine coal. In this one item alone, the 170,000 people in the county can increase their cash income by more than 7 yuan each.

    百宝归家
    据新华社讯　在“百宝归家”的口号下，贵州省展开了群众性的采集山货运动。各地人民公社都随采随加工随向国家出售。据不完全统计，从11月1日至23日，收购部门用于收购桐子、茶子、蓖麻、生漆等山货的现金已达五千多万元。
    自11月上旬以来，贵州省各地对山货的采集和收购工作都作了统一的布置和安排。到目前止，黔东南苗族侗族自治州和水城、沿河、黔西等县，都已完成或基本完成了各种山货的采摘工作。
    据新华社讯　贵州省黔东南苗族侗族自治州炉山县在秋耕秋种基本结束后，组织各族社员大搞副业生产。
    炉山县是苗族主要聚居区之一，今年农业获得丰收，但公社现金收入不多。因此中共炉山县委在秋耕秋种基本结束后迅速安排劳力，因地制宜地有特色地发展各种副业生产。县委指定负责财贸、工业的书记挂帅，各区、公社也都有党委书记专门负责副业生产的领导。根据当地多山多煤的情况，各公社首先组织了五千八百多人挖煤。仅这一项，全县十七万多人每人就可增加现金收入七元多。
