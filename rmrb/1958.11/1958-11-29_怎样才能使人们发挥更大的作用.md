Wei Gao believes that even in a communist society, there will still be a need for people engaged solely in mental labor. One of the reasons is that only in this way can we "most rationally utilize human resources" and "enable people to play a greater role." This view is not only theoretically wrong, but also reflects, in its ideological consciousness, the desire of the exploiting classes to continue monopolizing knowledge.

First of all, we believe that, with the continuous development of production, the combination of mental and physical labor is an inevitable trend, a law of social development that no one can stop. Because production in a communist society is based on highly developed technology, it requires laborers with advanced science, technology, and cultural knowledge to master and engage in creative labor; otherwise, there is no way to promote and develop production. In other words, the development of production requires everyone to be a laborer who combines mental and physical labor; purely mental labor or purely physical labor will no longer exist at that time.

Just take the current agricultural production in our country as an example, and we can clearly see the inevitable trend of combining mental and physical labor. For example, to manage a large commune with thousands or tens of thousands of households, it is necessary to solve many economic, political, and even philosophical problems. Without knowledge in these areas, it is difficult to satisfactorily promote the development of work and production. To carry out large-scale agricultural production using advanced technology and farming methods, to establish large numbers of various factories, one cannot conduct production well without scientific knowledge of agriculture and industry. Doesn't mechanization, electrification, chemical fertilization, etc., also require knowledge of physics, chemistry, and other fields? It can be predicted that after further development of production, theoretical knowledge of atomic energy, automatic control, and other things now considered cutting-edge science will also become indispensable in production. Precisely because the broad masses of peasants have experienced this demand for the development of production, they are eager to master cultural and scientific knowledge in order to promote the leaping development of various productions.

We believe that under the leadership of the Party, and on the basis of establishing Red and Expert Schools everywhere, 500 million peasants will rapidly become laborers who can engage in both physical and mental labor, eliminating the serious difference between mental and physical labor that has existed for thousands of years, thereby creating greater achievements in production and launching even bigger satellites. The desire to have the broad masses of laborers remain forever as purely physical laborers is just a fantasy!

Secondly, facts have proven that, under the conditions of increasingly developed production, maintaining the difference between mental and physical labor not only fails to enable people to play a greater role, but also restricts people's all-round development and limits the development of their talents. Only by combining the two can we more rationally utilize human resources and better enable people to play their roles. We can look at this issue separately from the perspectives of industrial and agricultural laborers and intellectuals.

In the thousands of years before liberation, because the ruling class monopolized science and culture, depriving the broad masses of working people of the right and conditions to receive education, laborers were bound to heavy physical labor for life, which greatly limited their talents, even though they had accumulated rich experience in long-term production practice, because they did not have enough time and conditions to accept the scientific and cultural achievements of their predecessors, preventing them from summarizing and improving this valuable experience, thereby hindering them from rapidly promoting the development of production.

After liberation, the working people were freed from oppression and exploitation, became the masters of the country, and also gained the opportunity to receive education. At this time, we can see how brilliant talents and wisdom the working people will display and how amazing miracles they will create once science and culture are returned to their true masters—the working people!

Countless examples since the Great Leap Forward are inspiring. Liao Shigang, a worker in Chongqing, studied science and technology, constantly inventing and creating, and increased his work efficiency by thousands of times. An ordinary worker in Tianjin, using the scientific knowledge he had gained through hard study, systematically summarized and improved his experience in production, wrote the book "Spark Point Welding Method," and corrected errors that Japanese experts had made for decades. Wang Baojing, a farmer in Shaanxi, created "Field Design Science" and cultivated more than two hundred new varieties. The broad masses of peasants attended Red and Expert Schools, learned agricultural knowledge, improved and refined their farming techniques, and creatively utilized existing production experience, resulting in a series of world-shaking high-yield satellites in agriculture. If China's 600 million working people can master science and culture and become conscious and cultured laborers, then they will surely promote the leaping development of our country's production and scientific undertakings with a momentum as powerful as mountains and rivers.

These facts show that only when those engaged in physical labor master scientific and cultural knowledge and become people who can engage in both physical and mental labor can they truly play the greatest role. The view that there is no need for those engaged in physical labor to master a lot of theoretical knowledge is unfounded. The essence of this view is to deny the need for workers and peasants to become knowledgeable, and it attempts to keep the broad masses of working people forever bound to heavy physical labor, while they themselves occupy the special position of engaging solely in mental labor.

Let's take a look at the situation of some bourgeois experts and professors who are divorced from production and reality. They should be said to be people who "engage solely in mental labor" cultivated according to the training methods proposed by Wei Gao. They do have a lot of knowledge in books, but they appear very ignorant once they come into contact with reality. For example, a group of teachers from the Plant Research Section of the Biology Department of a certain school went to the countryside and passed by a water chestnut field. Someone guessed it was arrowhead, someone else said it was daffodil, and still others actually thought it was an onion, arguing for a long time without knowing what it was. A member of the Academy of Sciences and rice expert in the Biology Department spent two class periods lecturing on photosynthesis, using formulas and calculations, and the conclusion was that the maximum rice yield per mu was about 3,000 jin. A famous chemistry professor did not know how to use a multimeter. It is not that these intellectuals have no talent, but because they were trained under the bourgeois education system and are purely mental laborers—which is exactly what Wei Gao advocates—so it is impossible to use their knowledge to promote production. Can this be said to be "the most rational utilization of human resources" and "enabling people to play a greater role"?

Conversely, we have seen that it is precisely because the Party has resolutely implemented the educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor that our education has created unprecedented miracles in a very short period of time, greatly promoting the development of science and technology. For example, in the Great Leap Forward in scientific research at Peking University, because we implemented the policy of combining teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, we completed 4,139 scientific research projects in two months, of which 227 exceeded or reached international levels. Both in terms of quantity and quality, it far exceeded the total achievements of scientific research in the years since liberation. Some students in the Physics Department, who in the past could not even distinguish between ordinary diodes and transistors, were able to design and manufacture them themselves after participating in productive labor in factories. Students who participated in labor in semiconductor factories made products such as thermistors and photoresistors that reached international levels within ten days.

These facts once again prove that physical labor engaged in material production is the main source of the continuous development of human intelligence. And the knowledge gained from engaging solely in mental labor is one-sided and not very useful. Only by realizing the principle of combining mental and physical labor can we cultivate truly knowledgeable and well-rounded talents. And only such people can most effectively use their talents and make greater contributions to production and scientific undertakings.

Especially at present, another significance of intellectuals participating in physical labor lies in the fact that this is an important way to transform their thinking and cultivate themselves into working-class intellectuals. Therefore, our education cannot continue to follow the bourgeois educational line advocated by Wei Gao, training people who engage solely in mental labor. What we want to cultivate are working-class intellectuals who can engage in both mental and physical labor, and are both literate and martial, as required by social development.

    怎样才能使人们发挥更大的作用
    王金锡　苏志中
    魏高认为，到了共产主义社会仍然需要有单纯从事脑力劳动的人。理由之一是：只有这样才能“最合理的利用人力”，“发挥人们更大的作用”。这种观点不仅在理论上是错误的，而且在思想意识上正是反映了剥削阶级继续垄断知识的愿望。
    首先，我们认为，随着生产的不断发展，脑力劳动和体力劳动的结合是一个必然的趋势，是社会发展的规律，是任何人都阻挡不了的。因为共产主义社会的生产是建立在高度发展的技术基础上的，它要求有高度科学技术和文化知识的劳动者去掌握，并进行创造性的劳动，否则就没有办法推动和发展生产。换句话说，生产的发展，要求每个人是脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的劳动者，单纯的脑力劳动或单纯的体力劳动到那时候是不会再存在了。
    就举当前我国农业生产为例，也可以清楚地看到脑力劳动和体力劳动必然结合的趋势。如要管理一个几千几万户的大公社，是要解决许多经济上、政治上甚至哲学上的问题的，没有这些方面的知识，就很难完满地推动工作和生产的发展。要用先进技术和耕作方法搞大面积农业生产，要兴办大批的各式各样的工厂，没有农业和工业方面的科学知识，同样不能很好地进行生产。搞机械化、电气化、化肥化等等，不也需要物理、化学等方面的知识吗？可以预料，生产进一步发展之后，原子能、自动化控制等现在认为是尖端科学的理论知识，也将成为生产上所不可缺少的。广大农民正由于体验到生产发展的这种要求，所以他们迫切希望掌握文化科学知识，以便推动各项生产飞跃发展。
    我们相信，在党的领导下，在各地大办红专学校的基础上，五亿农民将迅速地成为既能从事体力劳动、又能从事脑力劳动的劳动者，消除几千年来脑力劳动和体力劳动的严重差别，从而在生产上创造出更伟大的成绩，放射出更大的卫星。那种硬要广大劳动群众永远做个单纯的体力劳动者的愿望，只能是一种幻想！
    其次，事实证明，在生产日益发展的情况下，保持脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，不仅不能发挥人们更大的作用，而且会限制人们的全面发展，限制人们的才智的发挥。只有把二者结合起来，才能更合理的利用人力，更好的发挥人们的作用。我们可以分别从工农劳动者和知识分子两方面来看一下这个问题。
    在解放以前的几千年当中，由于统治阶级垄断了科学文化，剥夺了广大劳动人民受教育的权利和条件，劳动者终生被束缚在繁重的体力劳动中，因而使得劳动人民虽然在长期生产实践中积累了丰富的经验，但是由于没有足够的时间和条件去接受前人的科学文化成果，而使他们的才智受到了极大的限制，使他们不能把这些宝贵的经验加以总结和提高，从而也妨碍了他们迅速地推动生产的发展。
    解放以后，劳动人民摆脱了压迫和剥削，成为国家的主人，也获得了受教育的机会。这时，我们可以看到，当科学文化一旦交还给它真正的主人——劳动人民之后，劳动人民会显示出多么灿烂的才华和智慧，创造出多么惊人的奇迹！
    大跃进以来的无数事例，是振奋人心的。重庆的工人廖世刚，钻研科学技术，不断发明创造，工作效率提高了几千倍。天津的一个普通工人，利用刻苦学习所得的科学知识，系统地总结和提高了生产中的经验，写了“火花点溶法”一书，改正了日本专家存在了几十年的错误。陕西农民王保京创立了“田间设计学”，培育了二百多种新品种。广大农民上了红专学校、学了农业知识，提高和改进了耕种技术，创造性地利用了已有的生产经验，结果在农业中放出了一连串震动世界的高产卫星。如果中国六亿劳动人民都能掌握了科学文化，成为有觉悟有文化的劳动者，那么，他们一定会以气壮山河之势，推动我国生产和科学事业飞跃发展。
    这些事实说明：从事体力劳动的人只有掌握了科学文化知识，成为既能从事体力劳动又能从事脑力劳动的人，才能真正发挥最大的作用。那种认为从事体力劳动的人没有必要掌握很多理论知识的观点，是毫无根据的。这种观点实质上是否认工农需要知识化，是企图让广大劳动人民永远束缚在繁重的体力劳动中，而自己则居于单纯从事脑力劳动的特殊地位。
    让我们再来看一看脱离生产、脱离实际的某些资产阶级专家教授们的情况吧。他们应该说是按照魏高所提出的培养方法培养出来的“从事单纯脑力劳动”的人。他们书本上的知识确实不少，但是一接触实际，就显得十分无知。例如某校生物系植物教研室的一群老师，下乡走过荸荠田，有人猜是慈菇，又有人说是水仙，还有人竟认为是洋葱，争论半天，不知道究竟是什么。生物系有一位科学院学部委员、水稻专家，在讲光合作用时，花了两节课的时间，公式套公式，计算又计算，结果得出的结论是：水稻亩产最多三千斤左右。一位有名的化学教授，不会使用万能电表。这些知识分子并非没有才能，只是由于他们是在资产阶级教育制度下培养出来的，是单纯的脑力劳动者——这正是魏高所主张的，所以就不可能使自己的知识用于推动生产。这难道能说是“最合理的利用了人力”、“发挥了人们的更大作用”吗？
    相反地，我们看到，正由于党坚决地贯彻了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针，才使得我们的教育，在极短的时期内创造了史无前例的奇迹，大大推动了科学技术的发展。例如我们北京大学在科学研究跃进运动中，由于贯彻了教学、科学研究和生产劳动三结合的方针，在两个月内就完成了科学研究项目四千一百三十九项，其中有二百二十七项超过或达到了国际水平。无论在数量上、质量上都远远超过了解放几年来科学研究的总成绩。物理系的一些同学，过去连普通的二极管、三极管也分不清，到工厂参加生产劳动以后，自己能够设计和制造了。参加半导体工厂劳动的同学，十天内就做出了达到国际水平的热敏电阻、光敏电阻等项产品。
    这些事实再一次证明，从事物质生产的体力劳动，是人类聪明才智不断发展的主要源泉。而单纯从事脑力劳动所获得的知识是片面的，用处不大。只有实现了脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的原则，才能培养出真正有知识的全面发展的人才。也只有这种人，才能最有效地发挥自己的才能，对生产和科学事业做出更大的贡献。
    特别是在目前，知识分子参加体力劳动的另一意义在于，这是改造思想、培养自己成为工人阶级知识分子的重要途径。所以，我们的教育不能再像魏高所主张的那样，走资产阶级教育路线，培养单纯地从事脑力劳动的人。我们要培养的是按照社会发展所要求的，既能从事脑力劳动又能从事体力劳动的、能文能武的工人阶级知识分子。
