　　By the Jinsha River.
　　Here are rarely seen towering mountains and ridges; here are rarely seen precipitous cliffs. White clouds float beneath one's feet. The flames of copper smelting furnaces surge. Although it is only late October, it is already very cold here. Coming here will make you even more appreciative of the admirable efforts of the people of Yunnan in responding to the Great Leap Forward in production called for by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao; coming here will make you even more appreciative of the admirable women of Yunnan in the Great Leap Forward.
　　This day, we climbed over a large mountain to watch copper smelting at that place filled with smoke and fire. Before we even reached the smelting furnace, the Party Secretary said: Look, how industrious the women of Yunnan are. In such deep mountains, they work like men, and women account for a full half of the workforce on our construction sites here. Indeed, this was the case. In the ore dressing yard, on the transportation routes, and by the copper smelting furnaces, women were all working intensely. By a tall smelting furnace, many people were gathered, listening to a young woman speak. The motor of the blower roared, and the flames from the furnace also roared. No matter how loud these sounds were, the young woman's speech could still be heard clearly:
　　"Comrades, our women's furnace has only been established for a little over a month, and we don't have much experience yet. The comrades at our furnace all know that without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, housewives like us would still be tied to the kitchen. Now that we have the communes and public canteens, we can concentrate on smelting copper." She was a little shy when she spoke, and her face was even redder than when she was holding an iron rod to stoke the furnace. She straightened her short hair in front of her forehead, pulled her hat back a bit. It looked like that short hair wasn't cut short in a barber shop, but scorched by the furnace fire. She paused for a moment, as if gathering her courage again, and raised her head to say: "In the past, we women couldn't come to this place to smelt copper. Now the Party has entrusted us women with the task of smelting copper, we must study technology well and complete the state's tasks even better." To others, it seemed that she hadn't finished her speech, but she repeatedly said: "That's all I have to say, that's all I have to say."
　　This thin-faced young woman is called Hu Jinying. The people here all call her Little Hu. Comrade Gao, who came with me, said that she hadn't gone home to sleep since the furnace was lit, and only closed her eyes by the furnace for a short rest. No matter how long she hasn't rested, from her bright eyes and thick black eyebrows, you can't see a bit of fatigue. Little Hu only came here from her hometown by the Jinsha River not long ago. Her husband is digging wind tunnels. Three months ago, she came to the mining area with the hope of becoming a worker. At that time, the leadership asked her to carry soil on the construction site. Little Hu was already very satisfied with such a simple job. Soon, she got another piece of satisfactory news. The leadership asked her to come to the copper smelting furnace. At that time, Little Hu was extremely happy. She couldn't wait to run to the side of the raging fire to train herself and become a veritable female worker more quickly. How much Little Hu envied those workers holding long iron rods! They leaned their heads by the furnace fire and bravely thrust the iron rods into the belly of the furnace. How much she envied the heroic scene of the workers on the smelting furnace, braving the long tongues of fire to fill the furnace with ore! But someone told her that going to the smelting furnace would scorch her hair, burn off her eyebrows, and the spraying sparks would burn her clothes and scald her face, and the sound of the huge blower would blow people over. These things had no influence on Little Hu, but made her even braver.
　　"We can do what men can do. The Party calls on us women to make progress, how can we not make progress?"
　　Little Hu's first day at the furnace was to remove slag. She didn't stop for a moment. The red-hot slag burned her lips that day. What did this matter? She encouraged herself inwardly: I can do what others can do. We are all young people, there is nothing that young people can't do, there is no hardship that young people can't endure. Every time she thought of what the Party Secretary said: It is not easy for you women to come to this furnace to smelt copper. It took the bloodshed and sacrifice of many revolutionary comrades to achieve the liberation of women, otherwise, it would be impossible for you women to come to the mine, let alone become copper smelting workers. Whenever Little Hu thought of this, she felt inexhaustible strength and unspeakable happiness.
　　An exciting piece of news came from the squad leader, Wu Pinggui, saying that the entire mining area would launch a copper smelting "satellite" on the 18th. Before launching the "satellite," a women's furnace would be established, and the leadership decided to have Little Hu work in the women's furnace. When Little Hu heard that she was going to work in the women's furnace, she felt an unspeakable emotion in her heart. The Party entrusts such important work to women, how much the Party cares about women! If I don't work hard, how can I be worthy of the Party. That night, squad leader Wu Pinggui told Little Hu:
　　"Li Guiying is the squad leader of your women's furnace, and you are the furnace chief."
　　"Don't talk nonsense." Little Hu was so nervous that her heart beat faster and her face turned red. "How can I be the furnace chief? I haven't even been a worker yet!"
　　"What are you afraid of? Just work hard! If you don't understand, there are teachers. Smelting copper skills don't fall from the sky."
　　"How can I be a furnace chief without being a worker!" The excited mood of going to the women's furnace turned into tension and fear. Little Hu was afraid that if she really became the furnace chief, she would not be able to complete the Party's task.
　　On October 14th, the women's furnace was lit. Before the furnace was lit, they also held a rally. The Party Secretary and leaders of the women's circles all spoke at the meeting. People welcomed Little Hu to speak, and she only said a few sentences about resolutely completing the task assigned by the Party and ended the speech with a red face. Before the furnace was lit, the enthusiastic teacher Wang Gang expressed to the comrades in the women's furnace that he would resolutely teach them the technology, and also signed a master-apprentice contract with Little Hu and Yang Guofen on the spot. Teacher Wang Gang also explained the basic knowledge that the furnace should pay attention to, saying that during operation, the front bed should be knocked clean of slag; the wind nozzles and temperature should be checked frequently; when the temperature is normal, the outside is red and the inside is white; when it is abnormal, the inside is black and the outside is white; when adding materials, they should be weighed with a scale. After Teacher Wang Gang explained this, Little Hu's heart slowly calmed down. These women were particularly inquisitive, and they asked many, many questions. No matter how the female comrades asked, Teacher Wang Gang could patiently and satisfactorily answer their questions. After the furnace was lit, she encountered a problem she had never encountered before: she assigned Lu Decai to add materials to the furnace, but Lu Decai wanted to watch the wind nozzle; she assigned Gao Guizhen to add materials to the furnace, but Gao Guizhen also didn't go. Little Hu had no way to deal with it and was really angry. Later, the commander criticized them, saying that it was wrong not to listen to the furnace chief, and who would do the feeding work if they didn't. Communist Party member Xu Cuilan immediately signed up, and then Li Guiying also signed up to go to the feeding place.
　　This night, the mountain wind howled. Fire kept窜窜out of the furnace. When Little Hu was holding ore and pouring it into the furnace, the hair on her forehead was scorched, and her face was burned red by the fire. She touched her burning face and continued to pour the second and third baskets of ore into the furnace. In fact, what threatened Little Hu was not the fire, but her lack of technical knowledge. Since she came to the furnace, she always ate on the furnace. Little Hu was originally on the night shift, and people on this furnace saw her working nervously at night, and they still saw her working nervously during the day. When I went to the women's furnace, the cadres here had already issued the order for her to rest for the third time, but Little Hu always said she was not sleepy, just afraid of not completing the task. The reason why Little Hu and these young people worked tirelessly is so simple. Their only thought is to smelt more copper for the country.
　　Copper was smelted, but only a few hundred kilograms a day. At present, they are doing all the preparatory work for a big push on the 18th. For these people who produce copper, time is more precious than anything else. There are still two days left before the satellite launch. Because too much ore was added, the slag flowing out was very thick, and the gold gate was blocked by furnace ash. They opened all three wind nozzles, but the flames still didn't come out. Teacher Wang Gang took a few young people and put in a lot of effort to open the gold gate and bring the furnace back to normal, but the power went out just as the furnace was restored to normal. A power outage was still a first for the women's furnace. How terrible a power outage should be! Li Guiying hurriedly covered the gold gate with furnace ash, and Little Hu led a few people to cover the top of the furnace with ash. Little Hu hurriedly called Li Zhuying to call her husband to see if there was something wrong with the circuit. In fact, Li Zhuying's husband had just gone to sleep. When he heard that their women's furnace had a power outage, he ran over in only his shorts. The inspection revealed that the fuse was blown. After the fuse was connected, the blower started to sound. Unexpectedly, the power went out again at ten o'clock in the evening. They covered the gold gate and the top of the furnace as usual, and went to call the electrician as usual. But this time it was not because the fuse was broken, but all the furnaces were out of power. An hour passed, two hours passed, several hours passed, but the electricity still didn't come, and the front bed was frozen. The copper smelters are most afraid of lifting the "monk" (copper frozen in the front furnace), and the most feared thing ultimately fell on the heads of these young people. They quickly dismantled the bricks of the front bed, and it took more than 20 people three hours to lift the 2,000-plus jin copper block. Unexpectedly, after the "big monk" was lifted, there was still a "small monk" weighing several hundred jin. They stood on that red-hot copper block, hitting it piece by piece like the size of a tile. People's hands were burned, and their shoes were scorched, but even so, the "small monk" still couldn't be taken out. Time was passing too quickly. The satellite was to be launched tomorrow, and if it was not repaired by ten o'clock at night, the furnace temperature would be difficult to maintain. Little Hu was so anxious that she really wanted to cry, but what was the use of crying? Later, they simply used refractory mud to mud the "small monk" in the front bed.
　　At ten o'clock at night, the furnace was repaired. The enthusiastic sound of the blower rang again. What was worrying was that the furnace temperature was too low. They chopped hundreds of jin of firewood and added it, and soon the furnace became prosperous. On the morning of the 18th, the furnace burned like never before, and these heroic women had not slept for four days and four nights. Unexpectedly, they produced 5.8 tons of copper that day. Little Hu was really happy that day. She was busy writing a letter to tell her husband in the distance. (Attached photo)

    巾帼炉旁
    本报记者　陈勇进
    在金沙江边。
    这里是人们少见的崇山峻岭，这里是人们少见的悬崖绝壁。白云在人们的脚下浮动。炼铜的炉火在蒸腾。虽然才是10月底，这里就已经很冷了。到这里会使你更加感到云南的人民在为响应党中央和毛主席的生产大跃进所做努力的可敬；到这里会使你更加感到在大跃进中的云南妇女的可敬。
    这天，我们爬过一个大山，到那烟火弥漫的地方看炼铜。还没到炼炉边，党委书记就说：你看，云南的妇女有多么勤劳。在这样大的深山里，她们像男人一样的劳动，我们这里的工地上，妇女占了足有一半。确实是这样，在选矿场上，在运输道上，在炼铜的炉火旁，都有妇女们在紧张地工作。在一个高大的炼炉边，这里围着很多人，正在听一个年青妇女讲话。鼓风机的马达在呼?呼?的响着，炉火喷出来，也发出呼呼的响声。不管这些声音怎么响，那位年青女同志的讲话还可以听得清：
    “同志们，我们妇女炉才成立一个多月，没有那样经验。我们炉子上的同志，都知道没有共产党毛主席的领导，像我们这些家庭妇女还不都拴在厨房里。现在有了公社，有了公共食堂，我们就能安心地出来炼铜。”她讲话时有些含羞，脸比在炉子前面拿着铁棍通火炉时还红。她理了理额前的短发，把帽子往脑后拉了拉，看样儿，那短发并不是理发馆里给她剪短的，而是炉火烧焦的。她停了一会，好像又鼓足了勇气，把头抬起来说：“这炼铜的地方，我们妇女过去是不能来的。现在党把炼铜的任务交给我们妇女，我们一定要好好学习技术，把国家的任务完成得更好。”在别人听来，她的话好像并没有讲完，但她却连声说：“没有那样讲的了，没有那样讲的了。”
    这位面容消瘦的青年叫胡金英，这里的人们都喊她小胡。和我一块来的高同志说她从开炉以来就没回家睡过觉，只是在炉旁合合眼就算睡觉了。不管有多长时间没有休息，但从她那明亮的眼睛里，从她那粗黑的眉宇之间，却看不出一点疲惫来。小胡是不久前才从金沙江边的家乡来这里的。她爱人在洞子打风道，三个月前，她怀着一颗当工人的希望来到矿区，当时领导上叫她到基建的工地上挑土。对于这样简单的工作，小胡已经非常满意了。不久，她又得到一个满意的消息，领导上叫她到炼铜炉子上来。当时小胡真高兴极了。她恨不得马上跑到烈火熊熊的炉边来锻炼自己，使自己更快地成为一个名副其实的女工人。小胡多么羡慕那拿着长铁杆的工人啊！他们把头探在炉火旁，勇敢地把铁杆通向炉子的腹部去。她多么羡慕那炼炉上的工人冒着长长的火舌把矿石填到炉子里的豪迈情景呀！但却有人告诉她，到炼炉上去会烧焦她的头发，会烧掉她的眉毛，喷出的火花会烧焦她的衣服，会烫破她的面孔，那巨大的鼓风机的响声，会把人吹倒。这些对小胡没有丝毫的影响，她却更勇敢了。
    “人家男人做的事情我们都可以做。党叫我们妇女进步，我们还能不进步吗。”
    小胡到炉子上的第一天是拉炉渣。她一会也不停息。红红的炉渣，当天把她的嘴唇都烤焦了。这算得什么，她内心鼓励着自己：人家能干的事情我也能干。都是青年人，那有青年干不了的事情，那有青年人吃不了的苦头。每当她想到党委书记说的：你们妇女能到这炉子上来炼铜，并不是件容易的事。不知有多少革命同志的流血牺牲才有了妇女的解放，不然，你们妇女是根本不可能到矿上来的，更当不上炼铜工人。小胡一想到这里真有用不完的劲儿，说不出来的快乐。
    一个令人兴奋的消息从班长吴品贵那里传出来，说全矿区要在十八号放炼铜卫星。在放卫星前要成立妇女炉，领导上决定要小胡到妇女炉去工作。当小胡听到要她到妇女炉上工作的时候，她内心真有说不出来的感动。党把这样重要的工作交给妇女，党对妇女是多么的关心！自己不努力哪能对得起党。晚上班长吴品贵告诉小胡说：
    “你们妇女炉，是李桂英当班长，你当炉长。”
    “你不要昏说。”小胡紧张得心跳起来，脸红起来，“我凭哪样当炉长，工人还没当过呢？”
    “你怕哪样？努力干就是啦！你不懂还有老师哩。炼铜的本事也不是从天上掉下来的。”
    “不当工人哪能当炉长！”到妇女炉去的兴奋心情变成了紧张和怕。小胡怕真的当了炉长而完不成党的任务。
    10月14日，妇女炉开炉了。开炉前，她们还开了誓师大会。党委书记、妇女界的领导人都在会上讲了话。人们欢迎小胡讲话，她只说坚决完成党交给的任务几句就红着脸结束了。开炉前，热情的王纲老师向妇女炉上的同志表示坚决把技术教给她们，当场还和小胡、杨国粉订了师徒合同。王纲老师还把炉子应当注意的基本知识向她们作了讲解，说操作时，前床要把炉渣敲干净；要经常看风嘴，看温度；温度正常时外面红里面白；不正常时里面黑外面白；加料时要用秤称过。王纲老师这么一讲，小胡的心才慢慢地放下来。这些妇女们，特别好问，她们问了好多好多的问题。不管那些女同志怎么问，王纲老师都能耐心地满意地回答她们的问题。开炉后，她碰到了一个从来没有碰到的问题：她分配卢德彩在炉上加料，卢德彩却要看风嘴；她分配高桂珍到炉上加料，高桂珍也不去。小胡一点办法也没有，真是生气极了。后来指挥长批评她俩，说不听炉长的话是不对的，加料工作都不干谁干。党员徐翠兰马上报了名，接着李桂英也报名到加料的地方去。
    这天夜里，山风呼啸。火不断地从炉子里窜出来。小胡端着矿石向炉子里倒时，前额的头发被烧焦了，脸被火烫红了。她摸了摸火烫的脸，继续把第二筐第三筐矿石倒进炉去。其实对小胡威胁的倒不是火，而是自己不懂技术。从她上炉子来，吃饭总是在炉子上吃，小胡本来是值夜班，到这个炉子上的人，在夜里看到她紧张地工作，在白天也仍然看到她在紧张地工作。我到妇女炉上的时候，这里的干部已经发出第三次让她休息的命令，而小胡总是说不困，就怕完不成任务。使小胡这些年青人不知疲倦地工作的道理就是这样简单。她们唯一的想法，就是为国家炼出更多的铜。
    铜是炼出来了，每天只是几百公斤。目前她们是做好一切准备工作，到十八号大干一下。对于这些出铜的人们来说，时间是再宝贵也没有了。离放卫星的时间还有两天，因为添矿石过多，流出的渣很稠，金门被炉灰堵死了。她们把三个风嘴都打开，火苗还是出不来。王纲老师带了几个小青年，费了好大的劲才把金门打开，使炉子转为正常，可是炉刚刚恢复正常却停电了。停电，对妇女炉来说还是第一次。停电该是多么可怕！李桂英慌忙地把金门用炉灰盖好，小胡领着几个人把炉顶用灰盖好，小胡忙叫李竹英去喊她爱人，看是否电路上有什么毛病。其实李竹英的爱人刚刚睡觉，听说她们妇女炉停电了，只穿了个短裤就跑来了。检查的结果是保险丝烧坏了。保险丝接上后，鼓风机就响起来。出人意料地，晚上十点钟又停电了。她们照常地把金门、炉顶盖好，照常地去叫电工。可是这一次并不是因为坏了保险丝，而是所有的炉子都停电了。一个钟头过去了，两个钟头过去了，几个钟头过去了，电仍然没有来，前床被冻结了。炼铜的人最怕抬“和尚”（冻结在前炉里的铜），最怕人的事情毕竟落在这些青年人的头上来。她们迅速地把前床的砖拆开，二十多个人花了三个钟头的时间才把那两千多斤重的铜块抬掉。出人意外地，“大和尚”抬掉后，还有个几百斤重的“小和尚”，她们在那火红的铜块上站着，像瓦片大小地一块块地往下打。人们的手被烫破了，鞋子被烧焦了，即令这样，“小和尚”也仍然拿不出来。时间是太快了，明天就要放卫星，如果到夜里十点钟修不好，炉温就难以保持了。小胡急得真想哭一顿，哭又有什么用呢。后来，干脆用耐火泥把“小和尚”泥在前床里。
    夜里十点钟，炉子修好了。鼓风机那热烈的声音又响起来。令人担心的是炉温太低，她们砍了几百斤柴加上去，不久炉子就旺盛起来。十八号这天上午，炉子空前未有地燃起来，而这班巾帼英雄们已经四天四夜没睡觉了。出人意料地，这天她们生产了五点八吨铜。这天小胡实在高兴极了，她忙着写了封信告诉她远方的爱人。（附图片）
