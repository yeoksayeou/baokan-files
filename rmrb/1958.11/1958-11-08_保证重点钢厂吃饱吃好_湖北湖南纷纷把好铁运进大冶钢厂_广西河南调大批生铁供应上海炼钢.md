    Guarantee Key Steel Plants are Well-Fed and Well-Supplied
    Hubei and Hunan are Transporting High-Quality Iron to Daye Steel Plant
    Guangxi and Henan are Transferring Large Quantities of Pig Iron to Supply Shanghai Steel Refining
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th November: Dozens of trains and ships loaded with raw materials such as pig iron are arriving at Daye Steel Plant from all over the country every day.
    Hubei, Henan, and Hunan provinces, responsible for supplying Daye Steel Plant with pig iron, are sending the best pig iron to support it. People of the Tujia and other ethnic minorities in the remote mountainous area of Maodong District, Laifeng County, Hubei Province, learned that Daye Steel Plant was short of scrap steel and supplied 148 tons within a few hours. Because there were no cars to transport the scrap steel, they loaded it onto wooden boats, detoured through Sichuan and Hunan, passed through five rivers and one lake, and more than two hundred dangerous shoals, and sent it directly to Daye Steel Plant.
    The newly built converters at Daye Steel Plant lacked blowers and motors. Electromechanical factories in Chongqing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Hohhot, which were contracted to manufacture this equipment, were working around the clock. To save time, the equipment manufactured by the Hohhot Electric Motor Factory was transported by plane, ensuring that these converters were put into production on schedule.
    The enthusiastic support from all over the country has deeply educated all the employees of Daye Steel Plant and boosted their confidence in completing their tasks. On November 1st, the plant created a new record for daily steel production, which was more than double the average daily output in October. The factory workers are striving for even greater achievements.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th November: Henan Province had transferred more than 60,000 tons of pig iron by the end of October. The task of transferring 100,000 tons of pig iron to support Shanghai and other places will be completed in the first half of November.
    Currently, iron and steel transportation organizations have been established at the provincial, special district, county, and people's commune levels. Xinyang Special District concentrated 660,000 transportation personnel and various vehicles and ships to rush to transport iron, transporting more than 20,000 tons of pig iron from the mountains and remote areas to the transportation trunk lines within two days. In order to ensure that the pig iron transferred out meets the requirements for steelmaking, Luoyang Special District also trained more than 400 pig iron quality inspectors to inspect, concentrate, and transport the pig iron. Nanyang Special District also adopted a method of quantitative storage, dividing the concentrated pig iron into different piles of two tons, three tons, and four tons, so that when trucks arrived, they could be loaded and transported without weighing.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 6th November: The 2,600 tons of pig iron from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to support Shanghai steelmaking were loaded and departed from Yulin Station on the Lizhan Railway on the 2nd. This is the first batch of the 100,000 tons of pig iron that Guangxi is supporting Shanghai with. The outward transportation of this batch of pig iron marks the end of Guangxi's history of relying on other provinces for pig iron support.
    After achieving a great victory in pig iron production through mass movements, Guangxi has launched a mass movement to transport pig iron, centered on supporting Shanghai. In recent days, large numbers of people have been mobilized to transport pig iron over mountains and ridges. Rong County was assigned a task of transferring 500 tons of pig iron, but actually transferred 600 tons, overfulfilling the task. Pingnan County organized 4,600 people and 4,400 wooden carts, and worked hard for one day and two nights to transport 817 tons of pig iron to the Liangjiang Wharf. All of these pig irons have undergone three levels of acceptance and are all high-quality iron. The staff at Yulin Station also demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm during loading, trying their best to complete the loading task ahead of schedule. They sang loudly: "People across the region are working together, with large and small furnaces all over the mountains; iron flows from the valleys and plains, and the Li River and the Five Ridges reflect the red light. Guangxi pig iron is transported to Shanghai, everyone is excited and ecstatic."
    In order to ensure the completion of the task of supporting Shanghai, the Autonomous Region Party Committee specifically convened a meeting of the first secretaries of the prefectural and municipal party committees. Liu Jianxun, the first secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, and Wei Guoqing, the secretary, emphasized at the meeting that supporting Shanghai with pig iron is directly completing the glorious task of 10.7 million tons of steel. Although industry and agriculture are very busy and the labor force is tight, we must ensure that the task is completed on schedule. The pig iron transported to Shanghai must be guaranteed to be all high-quality iron.

    保证重点钢厂吃饱吃好
    湖北湖南纷纷把好铁运进大冶钢厂
    广西河南调大批生铁供应上海炼钢
    新华社武汉7日电　全国各地每天有几十辆火车和轮船满载着生铁等原料，运进大冶钢厂。
    负责供应大冶钢厂生铁的湖北、河南、湖南等省，都是以最好的生铁运来支援。地处偏僻山区的湖北省来凤县卯洞区土家等少数民族人民，得知大冶钢厂缺少废钢铁，在几小时内就支援了一百四十八吨；这些废钢铁没有汽车运，他们就把它装上木船，绕道四川、湖南，经过五江一湖和二百多个险滩，直接送到了大冶钢厂。
    大冶钢厂新建的转炉缺少鼓风机和马达。承制这些设备的重庆、上海、沈阳和呼和浩特等市的机电工厂都日夜赶制；为了争取时间，呼和浩特电机厂制造的设备，还用飞机来运，保证了这些转炉按时投入生产。
    全国各地的热情支援，使大冶钢厂全体职工受到深刻教育，鼓舞了他们完成任务的信心。11月1日，这个厂创造的日产钢量的新纪录，比10月份平均日产量高一倍多。工厂职工还在争取更大的成就。
    新华社郑州7日电　河南省到10月底已外调生铁六万多吨。支援上海等地的十万吨生铁，将在11月上半月内完成外调任务。
    目前，省、专区、县和人民公社都建立了钢铁调运机构。信阳专区集中六十六万运输大军和各种车船突击运铁，两天内就把两万多吨生铁从山沟里和边远地方运到了交通干线。为了使调出的生铁都适合炼钢的要求，洛阳专区还训练了四百多个生铁质量验收员，边验收，边集中，边外运。南阳专区更采取定量储存的办法，把集中起来的生铁分成两吨、三吨、四吨不同的堆子，汽车来了不用再过磅就可以装载运走。
    新华社南宁6日电　广西僮族自治区支援上海炼钢的二千六百吨生铁，2日已在黎湛铁路线上的玉林车站装车启运。这是广西支援上海的十万吨生铁中的第一批。这批生铁外运，标志着广西一向依靠外省支援生铁的历史已经结束。
    广西在大搞群众运动取得了生铁生产的巨大胜利以后，又掀起了一个以支援上海为中心的大运生铁的群众运动。连日来各地都出动了大批群众翻山越岭搬运生铁。容县分配的生铁外调任务是五百吨，结果上调六百吨，超额完成了任务。平南县组织四千六百人、四千四百辆木车，苦战一天两夜就把八百一十七吨生铁运到两江码头。这些生铁都经过了三级验收，全部是好铁。玉林车站的职工在装车时也发挥了高度的积极性，尽量想法提前完成装车任务。他们高唱：“全区人民齐动手，大小炉群布山岗；山沟平原出铁水，漓江五岭映红光。广西生铁运上海，人人兴奋喜发狂。”
    为了保证完成支援上海的任务，自治区党委曾专门召开了地、市委第一书记会议。自治区党委第一书记刘建勋、书记韦国清在会上强调指出，支援上海生铁就是直接完成一千零七十万吨钢的光荣任务。虽然当前工农业十分繁忙、劳动力紧张，也要保证按期完成任务。运往上海的生铁要保证全部是好铁。
