Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 14th (TASS): The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a plenary session on the 12th. The meeting discussed and adopted the report outline to be given by Khrushchev at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1959-1965." The plenary session decided to publish this outline in the newspapers for broad discussion in preparation for the Congress.

　　The plenary session also discussed the issue of strengthening the connection between schools and practical life and further developing the Soviet national education system. The plenary session approved the draft resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers on this issue. This draft will be published in the newspapers for nationwide discussion. The meeting also decided to submit this issue to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

　　In view of the election of CPSU Central Committee Presidium member Belyayev as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, the plenary session relieved Belyayev of his post as Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 14th (TASS): In the report outline "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1959-1965," the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, announced that by 1965, the Soviet Union's total industrial output would increase by about 80% compared to 1958, and total agricultural output would increase by 70%.

　　The report outline also announced plans to fully transition all Soviet employees to a six- or seven-hour workday. It is expected that a five-day work week will be implemented.

　　Khrushchev will deliver a report on the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to be held next January. Now, his report outline has been published for nationwide discussion.

　　The outline states: "The fundamental issue of this Seven-Year Plan is the issue of accelerating economic development along the road of communism, and the issue of maximizing time in the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism."

　　The outline says that in 1959-1965, the state's investment in basic construction will increase by 80% compared to the previous seven years, almost equal to the total investment in basic construction of the national economy in all years since the establishment of the Soviet regime.

　　The outline points out that in 1965, the output of pig iron will reach 65 million to 70 million tons, the output of steel will reach 86 million to 91 million tons, the output of rolled steel will reach 65 million to 70 million tons, the output of oil will reach 230 million to 240 million tons, and the electricity generation will reach 500 billion to 520 billion kilowatt-hours.

　　The total output of light industry will increase by about half in seven years, and the output of daily necessities will double. At the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the total output of Soviet textiles, clothing, and footwear and the per capita output will approach the level of the United States. The per capita output of a series of important foods will catch up with and exceed the most developed capitalist countries.

　　By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the total grain output of the Soviet Union is estimated to be 10 billion to 11 billion poods per year.

　　The outline stipulates that the national income will increase by 62% to 65% in seven years. The real income of workers and staff will increase by an average of 40%, and the income of collective farmers will also increase by at least 40%.

　　The plan stipulates that people who now work seven hours a day will work forty hours a week.

　　The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that nearly 15 million housing units will be built in towns and cities, and about 7 million houses will be built in agricultural areas.

　　The report outline points out that the Soviet Union's superiority in the growth rate of production will create a realistic foundation for the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass the United States in per capita production level in about five years after 1965. By that time, or even earlier, the Soviet Union will rank first in the world in terms of both the absolute quantity of production and the per capita output, thus guaranteeing the residents the highest standard of living in the world. This is a victory of world historical significance for socialism in the peaceful competition with capitalism.

　　The outline says that by the time the Seven-Year Plan is completed in 1965, the total industrial output value of socialist countries will account for more than half of the world's industrial output value, while it currently accounts for about one-third. In this short period of time, the socialist world system will have absolute superiority over the capitalist system in the field of material life—the field that is decisive for human life.

　　The outline emphasizes that the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will further strengthen the economic power, defense power, and unity of the socialist world system, greatly strengthen the positions of peace-loving forces throughout the world, and set up new insurmountable obstacles on the road of war instigators, which will once again prove the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist principle put forward by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that it is possible to prevent war in the current era.

　　The outline concludes by saying that the Soviet Union has entered a new historical period of gradual transition from socialism to communism. The national development prospect plan for the next fifteen years will create the necessary conditions for completing the transition to communism.

    进入从社会主义向共产主义过渡的新时期
    苏联公布七年计划的报告提纲
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会在12日举行全体会议。会议讨论并且通过了赫鲁晓夫将在苏共第二十一次代表大会上作的关于“1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”的报告提纲。全体会议决定在报纸上发表这个提纲，以供广泛讨论，而为代表大会作好准备。
    全体会议还讨论了加强学校和实际生活之间的联系以及进一步发展苏联国民教育制度的问题。全体会议批准了苏共中央和苏联部长会议关于这个问题的草案。这个草案将在报上发表以供全国人民讨论。会议并决定把这个问题提交苏联最高苏维埃。
    鉴于苏共中央主席团委员别利亚耶夫当选为哈萨克共产党中央委员会第一书记，全体会议免除别利亚耶夫的苏共中央书记的职务。
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在“1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”报告提纲中宣布，到1965年，苏联工业总产值将要比1958年增加约80％，农业总产值将增加70％。
    报告提纲又宣布，计划要使苏联全体职工完全过渡到六、七小时工作日。预计要实行每周五天工作制。
    赫鲁晓夫将在明年1月召开的苏共第二十一次代表大会上作关于七年计划控制数字的报告。现在，他的报告提纲已经发表，以供全民讨论。
    提纲中说：“这个七年计划的根本问题就是沿着共产主义的道路加速发展经济的问题，在社会主义同资本主义的和平经济竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间的问题。”
    提纲说，在1959—1965年间，国家基本建设投资额将比以前的七年增加80％，几乎等于苏维埃政权建立以来历年国民经济基本建设投资额的总和。
    提纲指出，1965年生铁的产量将达到六千五百万到七千万吨，钢产量将达到八千六百万到九千一百万吨，钢材将达到六千五百万到七千万吨，石油将达到二亿三千万到二亿四千万吨，发电量将达到五千亿到五千二百亿度。
    七年间轻工业的总产量将增加大约半倍，日用品的产量将增加一倍。在七年计划结束时苏联纺织品、衣服和鞋类的总产量和按人口平均的产量将接近美国的水平。按人口平均计算的一系列重要食品的产量将赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    到七年计划结束时，苏联谷物总产量估计为每年一百亿到一百一十亿普特。
    提纲规定七年中国民收入将增加62％到65％。职工实际收入平均将提高40％，集体农民的收入也将至少提高40％。
    计划规定，现在每天工作七小时的人将每周工作四十小时。
    七年计划中规定在城镇建筑将近一千五百万套住宅，在农业地区建筑约七百万幢住宅。
    报告提纲指出，苏联在生产增长速度方面的优越性将造成现实的基础，使苏联在1965年以后大约再用五年的时间使按人口平均计算的生产水平赶上和超过美国。到那时候，也可能还早一些，苏联无论在生产的绝对数量方面，或者在按人口平均计算的产量方面，都将居世界第一位，这样就将保证居民具有世界上最高的生活水平。这是社会主义在同资本主义和平竞赛方面的具有世界历史意义的胜利。
  　提纲说，在1965年七年计划完成的时候，社会主义国家的工业生产总值将占全世界工业产值的一半以上。而目前约占三分之一。这样一来，在这个短短的时间内，在物质生活——人类生活具有决定意义的领域内，社会主义世界体系将对资本主义体系占绝对优势。
    提纲强调指出，七年计划的实现必将进一步加强社会主义世界体系的经济威力、国防威力和团结一致，将大大地加强全世界爱好和平力量的阵地，将在战争挑拨者的道路上设下新的不可克服的障碍，将再一次证明苏共第二十次代表大会提出关于现时代有可能防止战争这一马克思列宁主义原理的正确性。
    提纲最后说，苏联已经进入从社会主义逐渐向共产主义过渡的新的历史时期。今后十五年的国家发展前景计划将为完成向共产主义过渡创造必要的条件。
