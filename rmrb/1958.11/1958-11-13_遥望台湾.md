    Gazing at Taiwan
    He Xiangning
    I
    Green mountains can assist, yet also divide [Note],
    Remembering this poem from over twenty years ago,
    In cold weather, pine and cypress are pillars of the land,
    Scattered in Taiwan, do they know or not?
    II
    The beautiful rivers and mountains are infinitely good,
    How joyful to stroll together by the Biyun Temple,
    Expelling the American bandits with shared hatred,
    Why grieve and lament with whitening hair?
    III
    Gazing at Taiwan, filled with sorrow and sighs,
    Recalling past events, thinking of our comrades in travel,
    For decades, it has been like this every day,
    National prosperity accompanies us into old age.

    [Editor's Note] The above three poems were written by Mr. He Xiangning after reading yesterday's newspaper report about Kuomintang elder Yu Youren's recent poems expressing longing for the mainland and old friends. They follow Yu Youren's original rhyme scheme.

    In April 1928, Mr. He Xiangning and other patriotic figures within the Kuomintang jointly submitted a proposal to the Kuomintang authorities requesting the restoration of the cooperation between the two parties that had existed in 1924. However, only a minority supported it at the time, and the proposal failed to pass. Thus, she devoted herself to poetry and painting. He Xiangning, Jing Hengyi, and Chen Shuren collaborated on more than twenty "Three Friends of Winter" paintings, with Yu Youren providing the inscription.

    In 1934, Mr. He Xiangning invited several friends to collaborate on poetry and painting at his residence in Shanghai. He Xiangning initiated the effort, and Mr. Liu Yazi continued with a poem: "For whom to mend the broken rivers and mountains, the clouds and mist beneath the wrist are not to be taken lightly, gathering heroic ambition to return to tranquility, often leaning on a cane towards Jingguan." Yu Youren was also present at the time. A few days later, Mr. He Xiangning sent a collaborative landscape painting of a waterfall to Yu Youren for inscription, and Yu Youren responded with a poem: "Able to assist the green mountains, not just dividing them, what is the meaning of leaving the mountains, its sound flows throughout the earth."

    遥望台湾
    何香凝
    一
    青山能助亦能界〔注〕，
    二十余年忆此诗，
    岁寒松柏河山柱，
    零落台湾知未知？
    二
    锦绣河山无限好，
    碧云寺畔乐同游，
    驱除美寇同仇忾，
    何事哀伤叹白头？
    三
    遥望台湾感慨忧，
    追怀往事念同游，
    数十年来如一日，
    国运繁荣渡白头。
    〔编者附注〕上面三首诗，是何香凝先生看了昨日本报发表的国民党元老于右任最近赋诗怀念大陆和旧友的消息后写的。用于右任诗原韵。
    1928年4月，何香凝先生和当时国民党内的爱国之士联名向国民党当局提出一个提案，要求恢复1924年的两党合作，但当时赞成的人只是少数，该提案未能通过，于是寄情诗画。何香凝、经亨颐、陈树人三人合作所画岁寒三友图共二十多幅，由于右任题记。
    1934年，何香凝先生在上海寓所又约了几个朋友合作诗画。由何香凝首唱，柳亚子先生续题诗一首：“为谁来补破河山，腕底烟云未等闲，收拾雄心归淡泊，时时曳杖款荆关。”当时，于右任亦在坐。几天后，何香凝先生以合作瀑布山水画一幅，送请于右任题记，于右任题诗一首作答：“能为青山助，不是界青山，出山有何意，声流大地间。”
