Treasures from the Treasure House of Traditional Chinese Medicine
By our reporter Liu Peiheng

An Octogenarian Writes Books to Pass on Medical Knowledge

The 80-year-old veteran Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) doctor, Ran Xuefeng, often says: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have given TCM a new lease of life. If I live one more year, I must write down one more year's worth of experience; if I live one day, I must teach my students for that one day."

This white-bearded old man guides his disciples—young TCM and Western medicine diagnosticians—in the outpatient clinic of the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine every morning. In the early morning and at night, he also wields his trembling pen, engaging in writing, summarizing his rich medical theories and clinical experiences accumulated over fifty years into books. Currently, he has completed and is working on more than ten works, including "Resolving the Problem of Syndrome Differentiation in Stroke," "A Synthesis of Chinese and Western Physiology," and "Annotations and Comprehensive Explanation of the Treatise on Febrile Diseases." Opening these manuscripts, the characters are neat and tidy; if one does not see the person, it is difficult to imagine that this is the handwriting of an 80-year-old.

He is very enthusiastic about passing on the traditional medicine of the motherland to the younger generation. In his studio, people often see the old man urging his disciples: "Have you finished reading the books left behind?" "Are there any problems you don't understand?"... Young Western medicine doctor Chen Keji and TCM doctor Guo Shikui, under the guidance of the old man, after more than a year of study, are already writing "Syndrome Differentiation in Treatise on Febrile Diseases" and "Pulse Differentiation in Treatise on Febrile Diseases" respectively. Chen Keji has also compiled a book entitled "Unusual Cases of TCM Doctor Ran Xuefeng". This old TCM doctor also often patiently guides young doctors in the diagnosis, analysis of patient conditions, and explanation of pathology in the clinic. Under the guidance of the old TCM doctor Ran Xuefeng, four young TCM and Western medicine doctors treated fifty cases of hypertension, achieving significant results. Half of the patients' blood pressure has returned to normal. Most of these patients were originally severe cases with a long course of illness, and the heart, kidney, and blood vessels had varying degrees of hardening lesions. Some had been patients for ten or twenty years.

Letting the "Blind" See the Light Again

One day, the veteran doctor Wei Wengui of the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine received a letter. The letter read: "Thank you for your excellent TCM medical skills, which have enabled my eyes to see the light again..." This was a thank-you letter written by Huang Pei, who had recovered and was working happily.

A few years ago, Huang Pei suffered from "degenerative vitreous changes," which Western medicine considered untreatable. He had been treated in several hospitals for more than three years without success. Young Huang Pei was unable to continue working due to his poor eyesight. He thought of attending a school for the blind with great pain. Later, he was referred to the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine for treatment through the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital in Beijing. Doctor Wei Wengui used methods such as tonifying qi and blood for treatment. He saw improvement after one month, and his eyesight returned to normal after one year. After examination by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital in Beijing, it was believed that the patient's vitreous body was no longer cloudy and had completely returned to normal.

Dr. Wei has used ancestral medical skills to treat eye diseases for many years, relieving the pain and misfortune of many people. In the past two years, he has treated 220 eyes of patients with "incurable diseases"—optic atrophy—in the outpatient clinic, and all have improved to varying degrees, with an effectiveness rate of 83%. It is particularly effective in treating children who become blind due to optic atrophy after suffering from meningitis and in treating early optic atrophy. Bai Xilan, a three-year-old girl, had no light perception in both eyes and her pupils were dilated after suffering from tuberculous meningitis. Western medicine treatment was ineffective for four months. The child's parents, with a glimmer of hope, brought Bai Xilan to the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine for diagnosis and treatment. After taking ninety doses of Chinese medicine consecutively, the child regained her sight. The child's parents happily told the doctor that the child's vision had recovered to the same level as a normal child and could see a pin at a distance of more than three feet.

Conquering Infantile Paralysis

Infantile paralysis, a disease that is considered unconquerable in the world of medicine, has now been subdued by traditional Chinese medicine.

Infantile paralysis, also known as acute poliomyelitis, is an acute infectious disease caused by a virus. There is no specific treatment for it in medicine in various countries. Effective treatments can only save the lives of children, but most children are left with disabilities in their limbs.

Among the 129 children with infantile paralysis treated by Doctor Zhao Xiwu of the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, some could only flex, extend, and lift their limbs but could not walk or stand, or even roll over and crawl; some children had completely paralyzed limbs and lost the function of autonomous movement. After the onset of the disease, Zhao Xiwu used methods such as clearing heat and detoxifying to quickly eliminate the virus in the body as early as possible, reduce the close combination of toxins and nerves, and reduce the consumption of the child's physical and mental strength, thus saving the lives of many children. For example, six-year-old Cao Zhenguo suddenly suffered from facial and laryngeal nerve paralysis, had difficulty swallowing food, vomited sticky saliva, and had unclear pronunciation... After Zhao Xiwu diagnosed and confirmed it as infantile paralysis and treated him with traditional Chinese medicine for more than a month, the child's mouth was no longer crooked, his speech was clear, and there were no sequelae. He was running and jumping around as usual. Gu Qiguan, a boy who was just one week and three months old, was unable to stand or sit up after suffering from the disease, and his legs were weak. After ten days of treatment, he was able to stand alone and walk on his own. (Attached picture)

    祖国医药学宝库中的珍宝
    本报记者  刘佩珩
    八十老人写书传医
    八十高龄的老中医冉雪峰常说：“共产党、毛主席让中医翻了身，我多活一年就得多写下一年的经验，活一天就得教一天学生。”
    这位胡须花白的老人，每天上午在中医研究院门诊室里指导他的弟子——年青的中、西医诊断。清晨和夜晚，他还要挥着颤动的笔，从事写作，把他五十多年积累下的丰富医学理论和临床经验，总结成书。目前他已完成的和正着手著作的有“辩证中风问题之解决”、“中西汇通生理学”和“伤寒集注总诠”等十多部著作。翻开这些手稿，字字清秀工整，若不见其人，很难想像出这是八十岁老人的笔迹。
    他很热心把祖国医学传授给年青一代。在他的工作室里，人们时常会见到老人督促他的弟子们：“留下的书看完没有？”“有什么问题不明白？”……年青的西医陈可冀和中医郭士魁等在老人的教导下，经一年多的学习，他们已经在分别写“伤寒论类证”和“伤寒论类脉”，陈可冀还整理了“中医冉雪峰疑案”一书。这位老中医也常常在诊疗室里耐心地指导年青的大夫诊断、分析患者病状和讲解病理。在冉雪峰老中医指导下的四个年青中西医，治疗高血压病症五十例，已获得显著疗效，有一半患者的血压已恢复正常。而这些患者，原来大部分是病情严重、病程较长、心肾血管已具有程度不同的硬化病变，有的是一、二十年的患者。
    让“盲人”重见光明
    有一天，中医研究院的苇文贵老大夫接到了一封来信。信中写道：“感谢您的高妙的中医医术，使我双目重见光明……”这是病愈后的黄裴，在上班工作后带着愉快的心情写来的感谢信。
    几年前，黄裴患了西医认为无法治疗的“玻璃体退行性变症”，曾辗转几个医院治疗三年多都没效。年青的黄裴当时因视力太坏，已经无法坚持工作了。他非常痛苦地曾想入盲人学校。后来经北京中苏友谊医院介绍到中医研究院治疗。苇文贵大夫采用滋补气血等办法进行治疗，一个月以后就见好转，一年后双目视力恢复正常。又经北京中苏友谊医院检查，认为患者双目玻璃体已无混浊，完全恢复正常。
    苇大夫用祖传的医术治疗眼病多年，曾为许多人解除了痛苦和不幸。近二年来在门诊治疗了“不治之症”——视神经萎缩患者二百二十多只眼睛都有不同程度的好转，疗效达83％。特别是医治小儿患脑膜炎后由于视神经萎缩而双目失明和早期视神经萎缩，更有奇效。三岁的女孩白希兰，患结核性脑炎后，双眼没有一点光感，瞳孔也放大了，经西医治疗四个月无效。孩子的爸爸妈妈抱着一线希望带着白希兰来到中医研究院诊治，连续服九十剂中药后，患儿就重见光明。孩子的爸爸妈妈高兴地告诉大夫说：孩子的视力已经恢复到和正常孩子一样，在距离三尺多远的地方有大头针都能看见了。
    征服小儿麻痹症
    小儿麻痹症，在世界医学界这是被认为无法征服的病魔，现在却被中医中药降服了。
    小儿麻痹症又名急性脊髓灰白质炎，是由病毒引起的急性传染病。各国医学对它还没有特效的疗法。疗效好的仅能保下儿童的生命，但大部分患儿遗留下肢体的残疾。
    中医研究院的赵锡武大夫在治疗的一百二十九个小儿麻痹症病儿中，有的只能肢体伸屈、抬举，但不能走路、不能站立，甚至不能翻身爬行；有的患儿患肢完全麻痹，失去了自主运动功能。发病后经赵锡武以清热解毒等方法进行治疗，及早的将体内病毒尽快排除，减少毒素与神经的密切结合以及患儿体力精神的耗损，夺回了许许多多的孩子的生命。如六岁的曹振国突然面部喉头神经麻痹，吞咽食物感到困难，口吐粘沫、发音不清……经赵锡武诊断确证是小儿麻痹症，进行了一个多月的中医治疗，病儿的口角不歪了，说话也清楚了，没有任何后遗症，和往常一样到处跑跑蹦蹦。刚刚一周零三个月的男孩顾奇官患病后，两下肢软不能站不能坐起，两腿痿软，经治疗十天后便能独自站立，又能自行成步了。（附图片）
