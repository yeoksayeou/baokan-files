The peaceful reunification of our country is the most urgent national aspiration of the Korean people and one of the current basic tasks of our revolution.

Relying on the great Soviet army, Korea was liberated from Japanese imperialism's colonial rule, and a broad path for building a prosperous, democratic, free, and independent country was opened up before the Korean people.

However, due to the aggressive policy of US imperialism and the traitorous, nation-selling policy of its lackey, the Syngman Rhee clique, our country has not yet been reunified thirteen years after liberation.

**US Imperialists Divide Korea**

The Korean nation, which inherits the blood of the same ancestors and lives a unified economic and cultural life, has its territory divided into two halves, while in South Korea, occupied by US imperialism, the people groan in hunger and poverty.

If there had been no US imperialist aggression, if US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique had accepted our just and reasonable proposals for peaceful reunification, then without a doubt, our country would have been peacefully reunified long ago, and the people in the southern half would have been enjoying a free and happy life like the people in the northern half.

From the first day of its founding, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has regarded the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland as its noble task and has adhered to the unwavering position that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves through consultation, without any external interference.

From this position, the government of the Republic proposed that the governments of the Soviet Union and the United States simultaneously withdraw their troops stationed in Korea.

The great Soviet Union, our nation's liberator and true benefactor, accepted the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and US troops and completely withdrew its troops from North Korea by the end of 1948.

However, US imperialism more blatantly implemented its aggressive policy of turning South Korea into its permanent colony, instigated its lackey, the Syngman Rhee clique, to prepare for war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and carried out unbridled acts of provocation.

While the enemy was carrying out vicious provocations, the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic, in order to avoid the tragedy of fratricide and to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland, put forward the most reasonable proposals and continued to struggle patiently for their realization.

On June 19, 1950, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposed to the South Korean "National Assembly" to jointly form a single, all-Korean legislative organ composed of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and South Korean "National Assembly" to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland in this way.

This sincere effort and legitimate proposal received the absolute support of the entire Korean people and aroused wide international response.

However, the US imperialists obstructed the implementation of our sincere proposals for the peaceful reunification of Korea, and in order to stifle the great revolutionary achievements of the Korean people, further establish their rule over all of Korea, and turn Korea into a military base for aggression against the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, they finally instigated the Syngman Rhee clique to provoke a war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Not only that, the United States, gathering fifteen countries that followed it, stole the flag of the United Nations, exhausted unprecedentedly barbaric means of war, and attempted to conquer the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people.

However, under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people unitedly rose up to wage a just Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggressors in order to win the freedom and independence of the motherland.

The people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world gave active support and solidarity to the Korean people's just struggle for freedom and independence in spirit and in material. In particular, the great Chinese people, during the most difficult period of the Korean people's struggle, held high the banner of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, formed the Chinese People's Volunteers with their outstanding sons and daughters, and sent them to the Korean battlefield to aid the Korean people with blood.

The Korean people and the People's Army, together with the Chinese People's Volunteers, displayed unparalleled heroism in the three-year fierce liberation war and defeated the enemy's armed offensive.

This victory proves that there is no force in the world that can conquer a liberated people who have sovereignty in their own hands; it also proves that the international reactionary forces headed by US imperialism are not as powerful as they boast, but are merely "paper tigers."

This victory also illustrates the superiority of the people's democratic system, the correctness of the policies of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, and the great vitality of proletarian internationalism.

**Basic Line for Peaceful Reunification**

After the armistice was realized, the Korean people re-entered peaceful construction.

In order to strengthen the material guarantee for the reunification of the motherland—the revolutionary democratic base in the northern half of the Republic—the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic called on the Korean people to rapidly restore and develop the people's economy, which had been severely damaged in the Fatherland Liberation War, and on this basis, to carry out a broad struggle to build socialism. Our party, proceeding from concrete realistic demands, put forward the general line of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture in economic construction, and organized and mobilized all forces to launch a struggle to victoriously realize this general line and promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The basic line of our party and government for the peaceful reunification of Korea is: transforming the Korean armistice into a consolidated peace, withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, and resolving the Korean issue by the Korean people themselves through consultation on a democratic basis without any foreign interference.

The Third Congress of the Korean Workers' Party, held in April 1956, once again affirmed and clarified the basic line for striving for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

In April 1954, at the Geneva Conference for the peaceful adjustment of the Korean issue, the delegation of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward specific proposals based on the party and government's basic line on the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Our proposals received the active support of the delegations of the governments of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, but the US imperialists, who have always opposed the peaceful reunification of Korea, and the countries that followed him rejected our proposals. After the Geneva Conference for discussing the Korean issue was sabotaged by the US imperialists, our party and the government of the Republic continued to struggle to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

The Eighth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly, held in October 1954, suggested that a joint conference of representatives of political parties and social organizations of North and South Korea or a joint meeting of the North and South Korean National Assemblies be convened as soon as possible to discuss the issue of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

The Ninth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly, held in March 1955, proposed, as a current issue to promote the reunification of the motherland, the withdrawal of foreign troops, the reduction of the North and South Korean armies to less than 100,000 each, the realization of mutual visits and contacts between the North and the South, and the realization of economic and cultural exchange between the North and the South.

In order to promote the solution of the above-mentioned urgent issues of the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the government of the Republic has reduced the People's Army by 80,000 personnel and corresponding equipment, and proposed that the South Korean authorities reduce the North and South armies, and at the same time announced that the North and the South will not use force against each other.

The government of the Republic also put forward concrete measures to supply electricity urgently needed by the South Korean people's lives and to relieve the starving farmers, unemployed, and vagrant orphans in South Korea who are groaning on the verge of starvation from the noble standpoint of fraternal love. There is no doubt that the realization of this proposal from fraternal love would contribute to promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

**US-Rhee Clique Reject All Peaceful Proposals**

However, the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique unconditionally rejected all our proposals for striving for the peaceful reunification of Korea, and even did not want contacts and communication between the North and the South, did not accept our assistance from fraternal love, but foolishly clamored for "northward advance." In order to provoke a new war and to keep the US military stationed in South Korea for a long time, the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique concluded the "US-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" after the armistice. They also tried every possible means to obstruct the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which has made positive contributions to maintaining the Korean armistice. Not only that, they unilaterally abolished the important provisions of the armistice agreement, moved the "United Nations Command" to South Korea, transported a large number of new weapons, such as atomic and missile weapons, turned South Korea into an atomic war base, and frequently conducted large-scale military exercises, carrying out various provocative actions.

Under these circumstances, the question of eliminating the threat to peace caused by the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique in Korea, easing the tense situation, and ending the division of Korea as soon as possible has been raised with greater importance. During this period, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward a major plan on February 5 this year regarding the peaceful reunification of the country and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea.

In its statement, the government of the Republic proposed: that all foreign troops withdraw simultaneously from North and South Korea; that free all-Korean elections be held within a certain period thereafter; that North and South Korea consult on economic and cultural ties on an equal footing; and that North and South Korea reduce their military forces to the minimum.

The government of the People's Republic of China fully supported the statement of our Republic's government, and according to the agreement reached during the talks between the delegations of the Chinese and North Korean governments in Pyongyang in February, the Chinese People's Volunteers decided to withdraw from Korea.

Holding high the banner of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers, who participated in the Korean War to aid the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War with blood, completely withdrew from Korea by October 26, according to this proactive measure taken by the Chinese and North Korean sides, further opening up a new situation for the resolution of the Korean issue.

The people of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world unanimously support our just proposals on peaceful reunification, highly appreciate this proactive measure taken by the Chinese and North Korean sides, and unanimously demand that the US military also follow the example of the Chinese People's Volunteers and withdraw from Korea as soon as possible.

The withdrawal of the US military from Korea is a mature and urgent issue that can no longer be delayed. Now that the Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn, the US military no longer has any excuse to continue to stay in South Korea.

Due to the US military's forcible occupation of South Korea, the Korean people continue to endure the intolerable pain and disaster of the country being divided into two halves and the nation being split.

The result of the US imperialist aggressive policy is the extreme decline of the South Korean economy. Today, there are more than 4.2 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people in South Korea, 2 million vagrant orphans, and more than 1 million households of farmers who have run out of food, hovering on the brink of starvation.

The South Korean people under the reactionary rule of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique do not even have the most basic democratic rights. In addition, there are unprecedented atrocities such as murder and plunder committed by the invading US military.

Faced with a deep political crisis and completely isolated from the people, the Syngman Rhee clique is barely maintaining itself through fascist suppression and terror against the people. Today, the South Korean people have united to fight against the US and Syngman Rhee to get rid of hunger, poverty, and lack of rights, and to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

They yearn for the prosperous Republic of the North, which has become a paradise for the people, regard the socialist construction in the northern half as their hope, as a guiding lighthouse, and from this they derive the strength to strive for liberation.

**Accelerate Northern Construction to Promote Peaceful Reunification**

The northern half of the Republic has entered a great upsurge of socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the entire Korean people, led by the working class, with soaring revolutionary will, have launched a struggle to complete the first five-year plan one and a half to two years ahead of schedule, and are now creating admirable miracles every day and every hour. In this way, the northern part of the Republic today produces cars and tractors that our ancestors never dared to imagine, and is about to implement electrification and mechanization in the countryside, and the technical revolution and cultural revolution are also being implemented successfully.

In his report at the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic, Comrade Kim Il-sung put forward great programmatic tasks to be achieved in socialist construction in the next six to seven years.

Inspired by this solemn prospect, the working people in the northern half of the Republic are determined to complete the programmatic tasks put forward by Comrade Kim Il-sung not in six to seven years, but in four to five years. They are united like steel around our party and the government of the Republic, and are advancing courageously with the spirit of riding a Chollima horse.

After this task is completed, the Korean people will be able to ascend to a high ground from which they can realistically see a communist society. The successful implementation of socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic is a decisive guarantee for promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea, and it is also a powerful force that can rapidly restore the destroyed industry, the desolate countryside, and the hard lives of the people in the devastated southern half after the reunification of the motherland is realized.

In this way, today the policy of peaceful reunification of our party and the government of the Republic further inspires the broader masses of the South Korean people and vigorously launches the struggle to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

**US Military Must Withdraw from South Korea**

The masses of the South Korean people have further clearly realized that only by forcing the US military to withdraw from South Korea and realizing the peaceful reunification of the motherland is there a road to guarantee their freedom and happiness. They are now raising the banner against the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee bandits higher and higher. The foundation of the fascist rule of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee bandits is beginning to completely collapse from its roots. Peace-loving people all over the world and the entire Korean people resolutely demand that the US military withdraw from Korea.

Regardless of the situation, the US imperialists shamefully evade the prerequisite for realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea—the withdrawal of their own troops from Korea, attempt to continue to maintain the tense situation in Korea, clamor about the "threat from the North" that does not exist at all, and put forward absurd and ridiculous excuses, saying that they will not withdraw his troops from South Korea until the Korean issue is finally resolved. Even as they are carrying out provocative actions against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait, they are also conducting large-scale atomic war maneuver exercises in South Korea, and are plotting new war provocations.

At this session of the UN General Assembly, the US imperialists once again used his voting machine to pass an illegal resolution to keep the US military forcibly occupying South Korea without the participation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea representatives who truly represent the interests of the Korean people. This resolution, like the resolutions on the Korean issue passed by previous sessions of the UN General Assembly, has no effect.

Without the US military withdrawing from South Korea, it is impossible to imagine any free elections for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Only when the US military completely withdraws from South Korea can peace in Korea be consolidated, and the Korean people can realize unification in a peaceful way, based on expressing their free will without external interference.

Therefore, the US troops must withdraw from Korea immediately.

Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il Sung, the Korean people will surely force the US military to withdraw from South Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland with their own hands.

    朝鲜人民为祖国的和平统一而斗争
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相兼外务相　南日
    我国的和平统一是朝鲜人民最迫切的民族愿望，是我们革命的当前基本任务之一。
    依靠伟大的苏联军队，朝鲜从日本帝国主义的殖民统治下获得了解放，在朝鲜人民面前展开了建设富强的、民主的、自由独立的国家的广阔大道。
    但是，由于美帝国主义的侵略政策和它的走狗李承晚集团的出卖国家出卖民族的政策，我国在解放后过了十三年多的今天还没有统一。
    美国侵略者分裂朝鲜
    继承同一祖先的血统，过着单一的经济和文化生活的朝鲜民族，国土被分割为南北两半，而在美帝国主义强占下的南朝鲜，人民呻吟在饥饿和贫穷之中。
    如果没有美帝国主义的侵略行为，如果美帝国主义和李承晚集团接受了我们关于和平统一祖国的正当而合理的方案，那么毫无疑问，我国早已和平统一了，南半部人民也早就像北半部人民一样享受着自由而幸福的生活了。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国从成立的第一天起，就把和平统一祖国的斗争作为自己的崇高的任务，坚持了在没有任何外来干涉的情况下由朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题的坚定不移的立场。
    从这种立场出发，共和国政府建议苏美两国政府同时撤出驻扎在朝鲜的苏美两国军队。
    我们民族的解放者和真正的援助者——伟大的苏联接受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国关于苏美两国军队同时撤出的建议，到1948年底为止，从北朝鲜完全撤出了自己的军队。
    但是，美帝国主义却更加露骨地实行把南朝鲜变成自己的永久的殖民地的侵略政策，并嗾使自己的走狗李承晚集团，准备反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争，进行肆无忌惮的挑衅行动。
    在敌人进行恶毒的挑衅的时候，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府为了避免同族相残的悲剧，实现祖国的和平统一，提出了最合理的方案，并为其实现而继续耐心地进行斗争。
    1950年6月19日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会向南朝鲜“国会”建议，把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议和南朝鲜“国会”联合组成单一的全朝鲜的立法机关，用这个方法来实现祖国的和平统一。
    这种真诚努力和正当建议，受到全朝鲜人民的绝对的支持，并引起了广泛的国际反映。
    但是，美帝国主义者却阻挠我们为和平统一朝鲜的有诚意的建议的实现，并为了扼杀朝鲜人民的伟大革命果实、进一步在全朝鲜建立他们的统治、把朝鲜变成为侵略伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国的军事基地，终于嗾使李承晚集团挑起了反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争。
    不仅如此，美国纠集十五个追随它的国家，盗用联合国的旗帜，用尽史无前例的最野蛮的战争手段，企图征服朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和朝鲜人民。
    但是，朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的英明领导下，为了争取祖国的自由和独立，一致奋起进行反对武装侵略者的正义的祖国解放战争。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民对于朝鲜人民为自由和独立的正义斗争在精神上和物质上给予积极的支持和声援。特别是伟大中国人民在朝鲜人民进行最艰苦斗争的时期，高举抗美援朝的旗帜，以自己的优秀儿女组成了中国人民志愿军，派到朝鲜战场上来用鲜血援助了朝鲜人民。
    朝鲜人民和人民军队同中国人民志愿军一起在历时三年的激烈的解放战争中发挥无比的英雄气概，打败了敌人的武装进攻。
    这一胜利证明：世界上没有任何力量能征服在自己手中掌握了主权的解放了的人民；同时证明：以美帝国主义为首的国际反动势力并不是像它们自己吹嘘的那样强大，而不过是一只“纸老虎”。
    这一胜利并说明了人民民主制度的优越性，朝鲜劳动党和政府的政策的正确性和无产阶级国际主义的伟大活力。
    和平统一的基本路线
    停战实现以后，朝鲜人民便重新进入了和平建设。
    朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府为了加强祖国统一的物质保证——共和国北半部革命民主基地，号召朝鲜人民迅速恢复和发展在解放战争中遭到残酷破坏的人民经济，在这个基础上进行广泛的建设社会主义的斗争。
    我们党从具体的现实要求出发，提出了优先发展重工业和同时发展轻工业和农业的经济建设的总路线，并组织和动员一切力量展开为胜利实现这一总路线和促进祖国和平统一的斗争。我们党和政府为朝鲜的和平统一的基本路线是：在把朝鲜停战转变为巩固的和平、从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队、朝鲜问题应该在没有任何外国干涉的情况下由朝鲜人民自己以协商的方法在民主的基础上给予解决。
    1956年4月举行的朝鲜劳动党三次代表大会再一次确定和阐明了争取和平统一朝鲜的基本路线。
    1954年4月，在为了和平调整朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议上，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团根据党和政府关于和平统一朝鲜的基本路线提出了具体方案。
    我们的方案受到了苏联和中华人民共和国政府代表团的积极支持，但是，始终一贯反对朝鲜的和平统一的美帝国主义者和追随他的国家一起拒绝了我们的方案。我们党和共和国政府在讨论朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议为美帝国主义者破坏以后，仍继续进行促进祖国的和平统一的斗争。
    1954年10月举行的最高人民会议第八次会议建议尽速召开南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体代表联席会议或南北朝鲜国会的联合会议，以讨论关于祖国的和平统一问题。
    1955年3月召开的最高人民会议第九次会议作为促进祖国统一的当前问题，建议撤出外国军队，将南北朝鲜的军队分别削减到十万名以下，实现南北之间相互往来和接触，并实现南北之间经济、文化交流。
    为了促进解决祖国和平统一的上述紧迫的问题，共和国政府已裁减了八万名人民军队和相应的装备，并建议南朝鲜当局削减南北的军队，同时宣布南北之间互不使用武力。
    共和国政府还从崇高的同胞爱的立场出发，提出关于供应南朝鲜人民生活所迫切需要的电力，救济呻吟在饥饿线上的南朝鲜绝粮农民、失业者和流浪孤儿的具体措施。毫无疑问，这种从同胞爱出发的建议的实现，对于促进祖国的和平统一会有所贡献。
    美李拒绝了一切和平建议
    但是，美帝国主义者和李承晚集团无条件地拒绝了我们争取朝鲜和平统一的一切建议，甚至于不愿意南北间的接触和音信交往，不接受我们从同胞爱出发的援助，却愚蠢地叫嚣
  “北进”。美帝国主义和李承晚集团在停战以后为了挑起新战争，为了使美军长期驻在南朝鲜缔结了“韩美共同防御条约”。并百般地妨害了对维护朝鲜停战作出积极贡献的中立国监察委员会的活动。不仅如此，他们片面废除停战协定的重要条款，把“联合国军”司令部搬进南朝鲜，大量地运入原子和导弹武器等各种新式武器，把南朝鲜变成为原子战争基地，频繁地进行大规模的军事演习，进行各种挑衅行动。
    在这种情况下，消除美帝国主义和李承晚集团在朝鲜造成的对和平的威胁，缓和紧张局势，尽早地结束朝鲜的分裂的问题，更加重要地被提出来了。在这个时期，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在今年2月5日提出了关于国家的和平统一和从朝鲜撤出外国军队的重大方案。
    共和国政府在它的声明中建议：一切外国军队从南北朝鲜同时撤走；以后在一定的时期内，实行全朝鲜自由选举；南北朝鲜在对等基础上协商经济和文化联系问题；并把南北兵力减少到最少限度。
    中华人民共和国政府全面支持了我们共和国政府的声明，根据2月间在平壤举行的朝中两国政府代表团会谈达成的协议，中国人民志愿军决定从朝鲜撤出。
    高举抗美援朝的旗帜，为了用鲜血援助朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争而参加朝鲜战争的中国人民志愿军，根据朝中方面的这种主动措施，到10月26日为止，已完全撤出了朝鲜，为朝鲜问题的解决进一步打开了新的局面。
    以苏联为首的兄弟国家人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一致支持我们关于和平统一的正当建议，对朝中方面这次采取的主动措施予以很高的评价，并一致要求美军也效法中国人民志愿军早日从朝鲜撤走。
    美军的撤出朝鲜是再也不能拖延的成熟了的迫切的问题，在中国人民志愿军已完全撤走后的今天，美军再没有任何借口继续赖在南朝鲜不走。
    由于美军的强占南朝鲜，朝鲜人民继续经受着不可容忍的国土分为两半和民族分裂的痛苦和灾难。
    美帝国主义的侵略政策所造成的结果是南朝鲜经济极端雕零。今天南朝鲜有四百二十多万失业者和半失业者，二百万的流浪孤儿，一百万户以上的断粮农民徘徊在饥饿线上。
    在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的反动统治下的南朝鲜人民，连起码的民主权利也没有。另外还加上美帝国主义侵略军队制造的杀人掠夺等史无前例的暴行。
    面临深刻的政治危机而彻底孤立于人民的李承晚集团，通过对人民的法西斯镇压和恐怖而勉强地维持着。今天南朝鲜人民一致起来为摆脱饥饿、贫穷和无权利，争取祖国的和平统一而进行反美反李承晚的斗争。
    他们向往成为人民的乐园的繁荣的共和国北部，把北半部的社会主义建设看做他们的希望，看做引路的灯塔，并从此得到争取解放斗争的力量。
    加速北部建设促进和平统一
    共和国北半部已进入社会主义建设的大高潮。以工人阶级为首的全体朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，以昂扬的革命意志，掀起为提前一年半到二年完成第一个五年计划的斗争，现在每日每时都创造出令人敬佩的奇迹。这样，共和国北部在今天生产了我们祖先连想都不敢想的汽车和拖拉机，并要在农村实行电气化和机械化，技术革命和文化革命也在有成就地实行着。
    金日成同志在共和国创建十周年庆祝大会的报告中提出了今后六年到七年内要在社会主义建设中达到的伟大的纲领性的任务。
    为这种庄严的前景所鼓舞的共和国北半部劳动人民决心不是在六年到七年内而是在四年到五年内完成金日成同志所提出的纲领性任务。他们钢铁般地团结在我们党和共和国政府的周围，以跨上了千里马的气概勇往前进着。
    在这一任务完成后，朝鲜人民就可以登上能够现实地望见共产主义社会的高岗。共和国北半部社会主义建设的胜利实行是促进朝鲜的和平统一的决定性的保证，这同时是在实现祖国的统一后能够迅速恢复被破坏了的南半部产业、荒废的农村和困苦的人民生活的强大力量。
    这样，今天我们党和共和国政府的和平统一方针，进一步鼓舞更加广泛的南朝鲜人民大众，有力地展开争取祖国的和平统一的斗争。
    美军必须撤出南朝鲜
    南朝鲜人民群众进一步明确地认识到：只有迫使美军撤出南朝鲜实现祖国的和平统一这一条路，才是保证他们的自由和幸福的道路。他们现在越来越高地举起反对美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮的旗帜。美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮的法西斯统治的基础开始从它的根基上彻底的崩溃。全世界爱好和平人民和全体朝鲜人民一道坚决要求美军撤出朝鲜。
    不顾形势如此，美帝国主义者可耻地回避实现朝鲜的和平统一的先决条件——自己军队的撤出朝鲜，企图继续使朝鲜的紧张局势持续下去，叫嚣根本不存在的“来自北部的威胁”，并提出荒唐无稽的借口，一直到最后解决朝鲜问题的时候，也不从南朝鲜撤出他的军队。甚至他们在台湾海峡进行反对中国人民的挑衅行为的同时，又在南朝鲜进行大规模的原子战争机动演习，在策划新的战争挑衅。
    美帝国主义者在本届联大再一次在没有真正代表朝鲜人民利益的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的参加下，利用他的表决机器，通过了要使美军继续强占南朝鲜的非法决议。这种决议同以往历届联大通过的关于朝鲜问题的决议一样，没有任何效力。
    美军不撤出南朝鲜，就无法想像实行和平统一朝鲜的任何自由选举。
    只有在美军完全撤出南朝鲜的情况下，才有可能巩固朝鲜的和平，朝鲜人民就有可能在没有外来干涉的情况下，在表示自己的自由意志的基础上用和平方式实现统一。
    所以，美军必须立即撤出朝鲜。
    朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的领导下，必将迫使美军撤出南朝鲜，用自己的手实现祖国的和平统一。
