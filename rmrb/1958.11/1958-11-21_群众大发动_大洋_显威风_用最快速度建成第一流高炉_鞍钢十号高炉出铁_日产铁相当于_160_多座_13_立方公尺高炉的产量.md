Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 20th – Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 10 Blast Furnace, built at the world's fastest speed, produced its first batch of molten iron late on the 19th.

At 10:40 p.m. on the 19th, the golden-red molten iron rushed out of the tap hole, flowed through the long iron trough, and poured into the iron ladle like a dazzling waterfall.

At 11:00 p.m., the builders of the blast furnace held a celebration ceremony to congratulate the birth of this, the largest blast furnace in our country. Zhao Xiyu, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Yuan Zhen, Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel, both spoke at the meeting, expressing their sincere regards and warm congratulations to the builders.

The commissioning of the new No. 10 Blast Furnace adds a powerful new force to Anshan Iron and Steel. Under normal production conditions, its daily output of high-quality pig iron is equivalent to the total daily output of more than 160 small indigenous blast furnaces of 13 cubic meters. Therefore, it will greatly alleviate the current shortage of molten iron at Anshan Iron and Steel, enabling open-hearth furnaces to fully realize their production potential and creating favorable conditions for completing the leap forward plan of producing 4.5 million tons of steel annually.

This blast furnace is not only world-class in size, but also has the latest technological equipment in the world. In addition to advanced technological equipment such as a high-pressure furnace top and steam blowing, radioactive isotopes are placed in the brickwork at the bottom of the furnace. Through the radioactive effect of these isotopes, the degree of erosion of the furnace bottom by molten iron can be detected. Its material handling process is also fully automated.

This blast furnace, with its huge scale and advanced technology, was completed entirely by Chinese builders, from surveying and design to construction, in just over five months; the complete set of equipment for the blast furnace was also manufactured by Chinese factories.

In the construction process, the builders of this blast furnace displayed a communist style of daring to think and daring to act, breaking the "standardization" conventions in the construction of large foreign enterprises, and creating a model for the high-speed construction of large enterprises. The designers moved their offices to the construction site, absorbed staff from construction and production departments to participate in the design, and revised the design at any time based on the actual situation that occurred during construction; the construction department obtained the consent of the design department to break ground before the first blueprint was even available, changing the usual practice of designing first and then constructing; the construction and production units also changed the relationship of mutual entanglement between Party A and Party B, and between general and sub-contractors. All these aspects have greatly accelerated the construction speed. (Attached picture)

    群众大发动“大洋”显威风
    用最快速度建成第一流高炉
    鞍钢十号高炉出铁
    日产铁相当于160多座13立方公尺高炉的产量
    新华社鞍山20日电　以世界上最快的速度建成的鞍钢十号高炉，19日深夜炼出了第一炉铁水。
    19日晚上十点四十分，金红色的铁水冲出出铁口、穿过长长的铁水沟，像一道耀眼的瀑布似地倾泻到了铁水罐。
    十一时，这座高炉的建设者举行了庆祝典礼，祝贺这座我国最大的高炉的诞生。中共鞍山市委书记赵希愚、鞍钢经理袁振，都在会上讲了话，向建设者表示亲切的慰问和热烈的祝贺。
    新建十号高炉的投入生产，为鞍钢增加了一支强大的生力军。在生产正常的情况下，它一天生产的优质生铁相当于一百六十多座十三立方公尺小洋高炉的总日产量。因此，它将大大缓和目前鞍钢铁水不足的紧张状况，使平炉能充分发挥生产潜力，为完成年产四百五十万吨钢的跃进计划创造了有利条件。
    这座高炉不仅规模之大是世界第一流的，而且还有世界上最新的技术装备。它除了有高压炉顶、蒸汽鼓风等先进技术装置以外，还在炉底砌砖中放置了放射性同位素，通过这些同位素的放射性作用，能探测炉底被铁水浸蚀的情况。它的运料过程也全部是自动化的。
    这座具有巨大规模和先进技术的高炉，从勘察、设计到施工，全部是我国建设者完成的，时间只花了五个多月；高炉的全套设备也是我国工厂制造的。
    在建设过程中，这座高炉的建设者们发挥了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，打破了大洋企业建设中的“正规化”的常规，创造了高速度建设大企业的范例。设计工作者将办公室搬到工地上，吸收施工和生产部门的工作人员参加设计，随时根据施工中出现的实际情况修改设计；施工部门在第一张蓝图还没有到手时，就取得设计部门的同意破土动工，改变了先设计、后施工的惯例；施工和生产单位之间也改变了甲方同乙方、大包同二包的互相牵扯的关系。所有这些方面，都大大加快了建设速度。（附图片）
