Quotations

        Of course, society cannot liberate itself without liberating every individual. Therefore, the old mode of production should be completely changed, especially the old division of labor should be eliminated. What should take its place is such an organization of production that, on the one hand, no one can shift the part he should participate in productive labor (the natural condition of human existence) onto others; on the other hand, productive labor provides everyone with the possibility of fully developing and utilizing all their physical and intellectual capabilities. It (productive labor—translator) is no longer a means of enslaving people but a means of liberating them. Therefore, productive labor transforms from a burden into a pleasure.
            Engels: "Anti-Dühring"

    Communist labor, in a narrower and stricter sense, is unpaid labor for the benefit of society, labor that is not performed to fulfill certain obligations, not to enjoy the right to obtain certain products, not according to pre-determined legal quotas, but is voluntary labor, unrationed labor, labor that does not expect reward, labor without conditions of remuneration, labor based on the habit of working for the public good, based on the conscious need to work for the public good (which has become a habit), labor that is a natural need of a healthy body.
    Lenin: "From the Destruction of the Old System to the Creation of the New"

    To realize communism, it is absolutely necessary to concentrate labor to the highest and strictest degree nationwide. This requires first overcoming the workers' professional and regional dispersion and decentralization, because this dispersion and decentralization is one of the roots of capital's strength and labor's weakness.
    Lenin: "Draft Program of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)"

    What socialism needs is not ease and comfort but that all people labor honestly, not for others, not for the rich and exploiters, but for themselves, for society.
    Stalin: "Speech at the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers"

    语录
    自然，社会如不把每个人解放，它自己也是不能得到解放的。所以旧的生产方式，应该彻底地被改变，特别是旧的分工应该消灭。代之而起的，应该是这样的生产组织，它使得一方面谁都不能把自己在生产劳动（人类生存的自然条件）中所应参加的部分，推到别人身上，另一方面，生产劳动供给每人以全面发展并运用自己一切体力智力的可能，它（生产劳动——译者）不再是奴役人的手段，而是解放人的手段，因此，生产劳动从一种重负，变成为一种快乐。
            恩格斯：“反杜林论”
    共产主义劳动，从比较狭窄和比较严格的意义上说，是一种为社会造福的无报酬的劳动，这种劳动不是为了履行一定的义务、不是为了享有取得某种产品的权利、不是按照事先规定的法定定额进行的劳动，而是自愿的劳动，是无定额的劳动，是不指望报酬、没有报酬条件的劳动，是根据为公共利益劳动的习惯、根据必须为公共利益劳动的自觉要求（这已成为习惯）来进行的劳动，这种劳动是健康的身体的自然需要。
    列宁：“从破坏历来的旧制度到创造新制度”
    要实现共产主义，绝对需要在全国范围内把劳动最高度地最严格地集中起来，这就要首先克服工人在职业上和地区上的散漫性和分散性，因为这种散漫性和分散性是资本有力量和劳动没有力量的根源之一。
    列宁：“俄共（布）党纲草案”
    社会主义需要的不是好逸恶劳，而是所有的人都诚实地劳动，不是为别人劳动，不是为富豪和剥削者劳动，而是为自己、为社会劳动。
    斯大林：“在全苏集体农庄突击队员第一次代表大会上的演说”
