Editor's Note: Since Minister Peng Dehuai's "Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan" was published again, many readers have written to inquire about the detailed circumstances of Zhang Zuolin's death at the hands of the Japanese. We are now publishing this article.

    Time: 5:30 AM, June 4, 1928.
    Location: Huanggu Tun Station, northwest of Shenyang, at the intersection of the former Beijing-Fengtian (Beijing-Shenyang) Railway and the South Manchuria Railway (southern section of the China Changchun Railway).

At that time, Zhang Zuolin, the Grand Marshal of the Beiyang Government, was returning to Shenyang from Beijing. His special train had just arrived when a thunderous roar erupted, and a landmine exploded. The steel bridge of the South Manchuria Railway at the intersection was instantly destroyed, and the entire bridge collapsed. The rails were twisted and hanging down onto the roadbed of the Beijing-Fengtian Railway; the sleepers on the bridge were ablaze, and all the electric wires were severed. Zhang Zuolin's special train was blown to pieces. Fragments of the car body were scattered outside the railway line, and the bombed people were burning. Corpses were hurled three or four zhang away, some burned into black charcoal, and some were left with only white bones; the wounded who were not dead cried out for help.

Zhang Zuolin was seriously injured and died a few hours after being transported back to Shenyang by his subordinates in a car.

Regarding this incident, it was not difficult for anyone at the time to see that it was the doing of Japanese imperialism, because:

    1. The force of this landmine explosion was unprecedented since there had been explosive incidents. Such landmines could not be manufactured by Chinese arsenals at the time.

    2. According to experts, this explosion required at least two hundred pounds of high-explosive. With the tight security checks in the Shenyang area, it was impossible for ordinary people to transport so much explosives.

    3. The landmine exploded precisely when the carriage carrying Zhang Zuolin passed by, not a second off. It would not have been possible to be so precise without using an electric firing line. It would take six hours to make such a device. Its arrangement seemed to be the work of army engineers; and Huanggu Tun was completely under the strict control of the Japanese army, and no one unrelated to the Japanese army could approach.

    4. Zhang Zuolin's movements were very secretive. Understanding his departure time, the train number he was traveling on, and being able to quickly set up the explosion; it must have been someone who had a grasp of Zhang's movements and possessed a communications agency. Only the Japanese intelligence agency at the time could do this.

Naturally, what was even more important was the increasingly obvious contradiction in the relationship between Zhang Zuolin and the Japanese government. Therefore, Chinese and foreign public opinion was in an uproar, and widespread suspicion was directed at the Japanese authorities.

However, the Japanese government consistently adopted an evasive attitude towards the assassination of Zhang Zuolin; it even avoided mentioning the name of the incident, calling it "a major incident in Manchuria." On the one hand, it pretended to conduct a joint investigation with China, shifting responsibility to the Chinese side; on the other hand, it tried to clear itself, and when Japanese Diet members questioned it, it only used the phrase "under investigation" to get by. It did not utter a word about the content, and when Army Minister Shirakawa was about to rise to answer Diet member Nagai Ryutaro's question in the Diet, Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi publicly signaled to stop him.

In order to evade responsibility, the Japanese government also conducted extensive propaganda to the world through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and news agencies; pretending to say that two Chinese men were stabbed to death by Japanese soldiers on the eve of the car bombing incident in Huanggu Tun, and a letter found on their bodies proved that they were assassins sent by the Kuomintang Northern Expeditionary Army...

However, can the truth be covered up by lies? On July 26, 1952, the mastermind of the Huanggu Tun incident, the Japanese war criminal and former senior staff officer of the Kwantung Army, Kōmoto Daisaku, confessed to the whole story of the Japanese government's planning of the assassination of Zhang Zuolin in the face of interrogation by the Chinese people.

Why did the Japanese government kill Zhang Zuolin, whom it had personally supported? Kōmoto Daisaku revealed the vicious intentions of the Japanese imperialists in one sentence. At that time, he was running back and forth between various warlords in northern and southern China, interfering in China's civil war through warlords who leaned towards Japan. He said: "We will seize all pro-Japanese warlords. We will help them when they can be used; and find ways to eliminate them when they cannot be used!"

Is not the story of General Zhang Zuolin's dealings with Japan a good example?

As everyone knows, Japanese imperialism has always harbored aggressive ambitions towards our country. Especially during the First World War, Japan took advantage of the fact that Western imperialism had no time to care about the Far East and repeatedly launched aggression against our country, openly clamoring that "Manchuria and Mongolia are Japan's lifeline" and advocating the so-called "Manchuria-Mongolia policy"; attempting to emulate their means of annexing Korea to annex our country's Northeast and Inner Mongolia, and then step by step to invade the mainland. Around the time the Tanaka Giichi Cabinet took power in Japan in 1927, in view of the rise of the high tide of the Chinese revolution, it further promoted the so-called "active policy," using "cooperation" with the Manchurian authorities, especially with the then Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Three Provinces Security and Fengtian Military Governor Zhang Zuolin, to expand and develop Japan's special interests in our country's Northeast. It openly declared: "Japan regards Manchuria as a place completely different from other parts of China. If war spreads from other places to Manchuria and Mongolia, Japan will use force to protect its interests there." Of course, the ambitions of Japanese imperialism were far more than that; it also attempted to use Zhang Zuolin to expand from the Northeast to the interior, so as to dominate China.

Why did Japanese imperialism support Zhang Zuolin? Since Japan presented the "Treaty between China and Japan concerning South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia" (the "Twenty-One Demands") to the traitor Yuan Shikai in May 1915, its power in the Northeast has greatly expanded. In order to consolidate its colonial rule in the Northeast and further extend its aggressive claws into the interior, Japanese imperialists decided to support a puppet as a docile tool for its aggression against China. Let us see what Baron Goto Shinpei, a well-known strategist of Japanese militarism, said in his secret pamphlet: "Zhang Zuolin has a special status in Manchuria. He has no official experience and no relationship with the central government. If Zhang leaves Manchuria, he will lose his position, so Manchuria is Zhang's only territory. His focus is only on power and profit, and he has no other ideas. Moreover, Zhang recognizes that Japan has great power in Manchuria and knows that it is unfavorable to go against Japan and beneficial to obey Japan. If we use Zhang Zuolin, who has this special status and this idea, then the affairs of Manchuria, life and death, will be in our hands, not just one Zhang. Japan can rely on this power to run amok in Manchuria and Mongolia without hindrance."

At that time, Zhang Zuolin, a warlord who came from a veterinary background and started out with a landlord reactionary armed force, had his strength continuously increased and his position gradually risen after "meritorious" suppression of the armed uprising of ethnic minorities in Inner Mongolia under Zhao Erxun: from a militia to a patrol camp, and from a patrol camp to an army division...; after becoming the military governor of Fengtian Province and the inspector-general of the three northeastern provinces, he had become the ruler of the Northeast. Zhang Zuolin was also determined to further expand his power into the interior, so he sought the backing of imperialism. In this way, one sought a tool, and the other sought a backer; Japanese imperialism and Zhang Zuolin closely colluded with each other in a situation of mutual utilization.

Japanese imperialists indeed greatly supported Zhang Zuolin for more than ten years while using him to serve its "Manchuria-Mongolia policy." When Zhang Zuolin used troops in the interior, Japan's support for Zhang can be said to have been all-out. Especially in the Battle of Shanhaiguan in 1924, with the help of Japanese imperialism, Zhang Zuolin robbed a large amount of ordnance in Qinhuangdao, enough to equip seven divisions. And in 1925, when Zhang Zuolin's subordinate Guo Songling launched a mutiny, Zhang Zuolin would have collapsed long ago without Japan's full support. The reason why Japan did this was that it hoped that even if Zhang Zuolin did not completely cede the Northeast to Japan, he should obey Japan's orders. When Zhang failed to satisfy their ambitions, the seeds of murder were planted.

At that time, Japanese imperialists were particularly dissatisfied with Zhang Zuolin for several things:

    First, the "Twenty-One Demands" issue. When Japanese imperialists dispatched the Kwantung Army to assist Zhang Zuolin in eliminating Guo Songling, they forced Zhang Zuolin to guarantee the implementation of all the Northeast-related parts of the 1915 "Treaty between China and Japan concerning South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia" ("Twenty-One Demands"). Zhang agreed verbally at the time. In 1927, taking advantage of Zhang Zuolin's control of the Beijing government, Japan demanded that he fulfill his promise. Zhang Zuolin, awed by the surging anti-imperialist tide of the Chinese people at the time, could not act entirely according to the intentions of Japanese imperialism and resisted the implementation of the above-mentioned traitorous treaty.

    Second, the issue of opening up railways. Japan has always adopted a monopoly policy on railways in the Northeast, that is, the railways are built by Japan, or at least financed by Japan, and management rights are obtained. Zhang Zuolin's several attempts to borrow money from other countries to build railways failed due to Japan's sabotage. Later, fearing Japan's opposition, Zhang Zuolin began secretly building a railway from Dahushan on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway north to Tongliao via Zhangwu. The Japanese government learned of this and immediately protested to Zhang Zuolin. This road not only runs parallel to the South Manchuria Railway, but will also affect its income in the future; moreover, the Zheng (Zhengjiatun) Tong (Tongliao) Road, Zheng (Taonan) Road, and Taoang (Ang'angxi) Road, which were built with Japanese loans through this road, can connect the transportation of Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces. If Dahushan Road is completed, it will be a major blow to Japan's policy of monopolizing railways in the Northeast, affecting its aggressive deployment.

    Third, Zhang Zuolin planned to build a port in Huludao. If this port is completed, it will greatly affect the cargo transportation of the monopolized Dalian Port by Japan.

    Fourth, Zhang Zuolin set up checkpoints outside the stations of the South Manchuria Railway to tax the goods transported out of the South Manchuria Railway, resisting its freight transportation.

    Fifth, the Jihui and Changda Road issues. In order to promote its aggressive policy, Japan had long asked China for the right to build Jihui Road (from Jilin to Hoeryong in Korea) and Changda Road (from Changchun to Dalai in Heilongjiang); so that its port of Chongjin in Korea could become the second Dalian, so that Japanese power could directly reach the hinterland of Heilongjiang from Chongjin, and then completely monopolize the Northeast politically, militarily, and economically. Taking advantage of Zhang Zuolin's power in Beijing, the Japanese government raised the request again; Zhang did not agree.

In addition, the Fenghai Road issue, the Jihai Road issue, the commercial lease right issue, etc., were all considered by the Japanese government to be Zhang Zuolin's anti-Japanese behavior, and its hatred for Zhang was piercing; it considered replacing Zhang Zuolin's subordinate Yang Tingyu to serve its aggressive policy. Therefore, at the "Eastern Conference" held by Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi in Tokyo in July 1927, it was decided that the former Japanese Kwantung Army would disarm Zhang Zuolin, remove his entourage and subordinates, and isolate him. Later, Japanese imperialists, in order to "remove Zhang Zuolin, who had become an obstacle to Japan's establishment of a new country in Manchuria," finally resorted to poisoning and killing him.

Kōmoto Daisaku, the mastermind of the Huanggu Tun incident, admitted that Zhang Zuolin was personally killed by the personnel of the Japanese Kwantung Army Staff Headquarters under his command. They had set up a so-called "must-die formation" at Huanggu Tun Station, a point one and a half kilometers north of Shenyang where the Beijing-Fengtian Railway and the South Manchuria Railway intersect: they buried thirty sacks of yellow explosives in the railway intersection, and controlled the triggering of the explosion with an electric machine on an observation platform 500 meters away; a derailment machine was installed north of the intersection, and a row of commandoes were ambushed nearby. At half past 5:00 AM on June 4, 1928, just as Zhang Zuolin's blue armored car arrived at the railway intersection, Captain Tōgū of the Japanese Kwantung Army pressed the button, and the armored train was completely destroyed. Afterwards, in order to cover up the truth, the Kwantung Army Command immediately mobilized engineers to rush to repair the damaged part of the railway according to the pre-planned plan; and arrested more than a dozen innocent residents, falsely accusing them of being Kuomintang Northern Expeditionary Army conspirators. Kōmoto Daisaku admitted that they had also deliberately killed two Chinese and thrown them at the scene of the incident, with forged letters from the Northern Expeditionary Army stuffed in their pockets, in order to confuse the public.

Japanese imperialists not only bombed Zhang Zuolin to death, but also wanted to eliminate the roots, intentionally plotting to harm his son Zhang Xueliang. At that time, Zhang Xueliang was commanding the Northeast Army to retreat to the pass outside Tianjin. Later, he had to disguise himself as a soldier and sneak back to Shenyang in an army car. After the train passed Shanhaiguan, although Japanese imperialists sensed that Zhang Xueliang was on the train; only because they were not very sure and it was inconvenient to do a second bombing of the car, Zhang Xueliang was able to safely return to Shenyang.

Thirty years have passed since the Huanggu Tun incident. Why bring up old matters today? Only because this is a historical lesson. It fully demonstrates the characteristics of imperialists: when they need you, they will support you, and when they don't need you, they can use any vicious means. The imperialists in the world have no conscience, especially the US imperialists, who are the most vicious, just like what Minister Peng said in his communiqué, "at least no less than the Japanese who killed Zhang Zuolin." Shouldn't friends in Taiwan be careful? Please think about it! (Attached picture)

    为什么旧事重提？
    ——关于张作霖被炸事件
    张新才
    编者按：自从彭德怀部长再告台湾同胞书发表后，许多读者来信问及张作霖被日本人治死的详细经过。现特发表此文。
    时间：1928年6月4日上午五时三十分。
    地点：沈阳西北皇姑屯车站，前京奉（京沈）铁路和南满铁路（中长铁路南段）交叉的地方。
    当时北洋政府的大元帅张作霖，由北京返回沈阳。他的专车刚刚开到这里，一声雷响，地雷爆发。交叉点上的南满路钢桥顿时炸毁，全桥塌下。铁轨曲折下垂在京奉路的路基上；桥上枕木火势焰焰，电线全被炸断了。张作霖所乘的专车炸成粉碎。车身的碎片飞散到线路之外，被炸的人正在燃烧。尸体被崩到三四丈远，有的烧成黑炭，有的只烧剩了白骨；负伤而没死的人悲声求救。
    张作霖受了重伤，由部下用汽车运回沈阳后几个小时就死了。
    关于这一事件，当时任何人都不难看出是日本帝国主义干的勾当，因为：
    一、这种地雷爆炸力的猛烈，是从有爆炸案件以来不曾见过的。这种地雷，当时中国的兵工厂还不能制造。
    二、据专家估计，这次爆炸至少需要高裂性炸药二百磅，以沈阳地区那样严密的检查，一般人根本无法运入这许多炸药。
    三、地雷恰恰在张作霖所乘的一节车开过时轰发，不差分秒。若不是用电流引火线，不可能如此准确。作这种装置，需花六个小时。它的布置很像是出于陆军工兵之手；且皇姑屯完全在日本军队的严密控制之下，与日军无关的人不可能走近。
    四、张作霖的行动，非常秘密。了解他的启程时间、乘坐列车班次，而又能够迅速布置爆炸；必定是掌握张的行动。且拥有通信机关的。这只有当时日本特务机关才能做到。
    自然，更为重要的还是张作霖同日本政府的关系中间日益明显的矛盾。因此中外舆论哗然，普遍对日本当局表示怀疑。
    但日本政府对谋杀张作霖事件，始终采取回避的态度；甚至连事件的名称也讳而不言，称之为“满洲某重大事件”。它一面假装由中日共同调查，转嫁责任于中国方面：一面自行洗刷，遇到日本议员质问，只用“调查中”一句话搪塞过去。对于内容一言不吐，而当白川陆军大臣在议会中要起立回答议员永井柳太郎的质问时，田中义一首相当众用眼色来阻止他。
    为了推脱责任，日本政府还通过它的外务省机关和通讯社，对世界大肆宣传；像煞有介事地说什么皇姑屯在炸车事件发生前夜，有两名中国人被日本兵刺死，从身上搜出一封信件证明他们是国民党北伐军派来行刺的凶手……。
    然而，事实岂是谎言所掩盖得了的？1952年7月26日，皇姑屯事件的主谋人、日本战犯、前关东军高级参谋河本大作，在中国人民的审讯面前，供认了日本政府策划谋杀张作霖事件的前前后后。
    日本政府究竟为什么要杀害它亲手扶植起来的张作霖？河本大作一语道破了日本帝国主义者的毒辣用心。当时他正往来奔走于中国南北各军阀之间，通过向日本靠拢的军阀干涉中国内战。他说：“一切亲日的军阀，我们统统抓住。能利用的时候就援助；不能利用的时候就设法消灭！”
    张作霖将军同日本往来的始末不正是一个很好的例子吗？
    大家知道，日本帝国主义对我国一贯抱有侵略野心。特别在第一次世界大战期间，日本乘西方帝国主义无暇顾及远东，屡次向我国发动侵略，公然叫嚷“满蒙是日本的生命线”，提倡所谓“满蒙政策”；企图仿用它们并吞朝鲜的手段，并吞我国的东北和内蒙古，然后步步侵入内地。1927年，日本田中义一内阁执掌政权前后，鉴于中国大革命高潮的兴起，更加推行所谓“积极政策”，借着与满洲当局、特别是与当时的东三省保安总司令及奉天督军张作霖的“合作”，扩大和发展日本在我国东北的特殊权益。它公开声明：“日本将满洲看作和中国其他部分完全不同的地方。如果战争从其他地方波及满洲和蒙古时，日本将以武力来保护它在该地的利益。”当然，日本帝国主义的野心远不止于此，它还企图利用张作霖从东北扩大到关内，达到霸占中国的目的。
    日本帝国主义为什么要扶植张作霖呢？日本自从1915年5月向卖国贼袁世凯提出“中日间关于南满洲及东部内蒙古之条约”（即“二十一条卖国条约”）以后，势力在东北大大扩张。日本帝国主义分子为了巩固它在东北的殖民统治并进一步将侵略魔爪伸入关内，决定扶植一个傀儡作为它侵略中国的驯服工具。请看日本军国主义的著名策士后藤新平男爵在他所写的秘密小册子里是怎样说的：“张作霖在满洲有一种特别之地位，彼非有任何官历，也与中央政府无因缘。张离满洲，则失其地位，故满洲为张之唯一地盘。其中心唯知权势利欲，别无何等经纶。且张认日本在满洲有绝大势力，知背日本之不利，而顺从日本之有益。若利用有此特别地位，且有此思想之张作霖，则满洲之事，生杀由我，不仅一张也。即满蒙之事日本皆可依此势力横行无阻。”
    当时，这个马兽医出身、搞地主反动武装起家的军阀张作霖，自从在赵尔巽手下，镇压内蒙古少数民族武装起义“有功”以后，实力不断增强，地位也步步上升：由民团而改为巡访营，又由巡访营而为陆军师……；待当上奉天省督军和东三省巡阅使后，便已成为东北的统治者。张作霖还决心把他的权力进一步扩张到关内，于是寻找帝国主义的靠山。就这样，一个找工具，一个找靠山；日本帝国主义和张作霖就在相互利用的情况下密切地勾结起来了。
    日本帝国主义分子在利用张作霖为它的“满蒙政策”效劳的十多年中，的确对张作霖曾大加扶植。张作霖向关内用兵，日本援张可以说是不遗余力。尤其是1924年山海关之役，张作霖在日本帝国主义的帮助下，在秦皇岛抢劫到大批军械，足足配备了七个师。而1925年张作霖的下属郭松龄发动倒戈，若没有日本的竭力支持，张作霖早已垮台。日本所以这样做，原指望张作霖即使不完全把东北让与日本，也应唯日本之命是从。待张未能满足它们的野心；便伏下了杀机。
    当时日本帝国主义分子对张作霖特别不满的，有几件事：
    一是“二十一条”问题。日本帝国主义分子在出动关东军协助张作霖消灭郭松龄的时候，曾强迫张作霖保证实现1915年“中日间关于南满洲及东部内蒙古之条约”（“二十一条”）中全部有关东北的部分。张当时在口头上同意。1927年，日本趁张作霖掌握北京政权之便，要求他履行诺言。张作霖慑于当时中国人民汹涌的反帝浪潮，不能完全按照日本帝国主义的企图行事，抗拒实施以上卖国条约。
    二是打通铁路问题。日本对东北铁路向来采取垄断政策，即铁路由日本修筑，至少也由日本贷款，并取得管理权。张作霖几次向别国借款修路，都由于日本的破坏而失败。以后张作霖因怕日本反对，开始秘密修筑一条由京沈路的打虎山向北经彰武到通辽的铁路。日本政府得知，立刻向张作霖提出抗议。因为这条路不仅同南满铁路平行，将来会使它的收入受到影响；而且由这条路经日本贷款所修的郑（郑家屯）通（通辽）路、郑洮（洮南）路、洮昂（昂昂溪）路，可以联络辽宁、黑龙江两省的交通。打通路如修成，将对日本垄断东北铁路的政策，是一大打击，影响它的侵略部署。
      三是张作霖计划在葫芦岛建港问题。这港如建成，将大大影响日本垄断的大连港的货运。
    四是张作霖在南满铁路各站外面设关卡，对南满铁路运出的货物课税，抵制它的货运。
    五是吉会、长大路问题。日本为了推行它的侵略政策，早已向中国要求吉会路（吉林到朝鲜的会宁）和长大路（长春到黑龙江的大赉）的修筑权；以便使它在朝鲜的清津港成为大连第二，使日本势力可由清津直达黑龙江腹地，进而在政治上、军事上、经济上全部垄断东北。日本政府趁张作霖在北京掌权，再度提出要求；张没有同意。
    此外，奉海路问题、吉海路问题、商租权问题等等，都被日本政府认为是张作霖的排日为行，对张恨之刺骨；考虑改换张作霖的部下杨霆宇来代替张为它的侵略政策服务。于是，1927年7月在日本田中义一首相在东京召开的“东方会议”上，决定由前日本关东军解除张作霖的武装、去掉他的左右和部下，使之孤立。以后，日本帝国主义分子为了“除去成了日本在满洲建立新国家的障碍的张作霖”，终至下毒手杀害。
    皇姑屯事件的主谋人河本大作承认：张作霖，是他亲自指挥日本关东军参谋部的人员干掉的。他们事先在沈阳北一公里半京奉铁路和南满铁路交接点皇姑屯车站布下所谓“必死之阵”：在铁路交接点里埋置了三十麻袋黄色炸药，在五百公尺外的了望台上用电气机控制触发爆炸；在交接点以北装置了脱轨机，在附近又埋伏了一排冲锋队。1928年6月4日黎明5时半，张作霖所乘的蓝色铁甲车刚刚开到铁路交接点，日本关东军东宫大尉一按电钮，装甲列车全被炸毁。事后，日本关东军司令部为了掩盖事实真相，按预先计划，立刻调动工兵赶修铁路被炸毁的部分；逮捕十多名无辜居民，诬陷为国民党北伐军谋犯。河本大作承认，他们还曾专门杀了两个中国人扔在肇事地点，口袋里塞上伪造的北伐军的信，以便混淆视听。
    日本帝国主义者炸死张作霖不算，还想斩草除根，有意谋害他的儿子张学良。当时张学良正在天津一带指挥东北军退回关外，后来不得不改装为士兵，混入军队车中偷回沈阳。车过山海关后，日本帝国主义分子虽然感知张学良在列车里；只因为不十分肯定，又不便再干第二次炸车，张学良才得安全回到沈阳。
    皇姑屯事件过去已经三十年了，今天为什么旧事重提？只因为这是一个历史的教训。它充分表明了帝国主义分子的特点：用得着的时候扶植你，用不着的时候，什么毒辣的手段都可以使出来。世界上的帝国主义分子都没有良心，特别是美帝国主义者最凶恶，正像彭部长发表的文告中所说的“至少不下于治死张作霖的日本人”。难道台湾的朋友们，不应该当心一点儿吗？请你们想一想吧！（附图片）
