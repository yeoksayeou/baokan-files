Xinhua News Agency, 8th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan Socialist Party held an emergency meeting of the Central Executive Committee and a general meeting of Diet members in Tokyo on the evening of the 7th. The meeting issued a statement saying that the 30th Extraordinary Diet session ended on the 7th. The "Amendment to the Police Officer Duty Execution Law" has been fiercely countered by public opinion, and deliberation has not yet been completed; this bill has become invalid.

The statement said that the resolution to extend the Diet session is invalid. The Socialist Party will investigate the responsibility of Jiro Hoshijima, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Saburo Shiikuma, Vice-Speaker, and demand their immediate resignation.

The statement said that in order to prevent Japan from embarking on the path of fascism and war, and to safeguard democracy and defend peace, the Socialist Party will use the strength of the entire party, stand at the forefront of the people, and fight for the dissolution of the Diet and the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet.

The Socialist Party held another meeting of Socialist Diet members today and decided to organize a protest group of about 50 people, headed by Isamu Akamatsu, to go to the Diet to investigate the responsibility of Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and House Speaker Hoshijima and Vice-Speaker Shiikuma.

After the meeting, all participants took to the streets for a demonstration.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan Socialist Party held a meeting of chairmen and bureau directors in Tokyo today, and decided that all Socialist Party members of the Diet would refuse to participate in all Diet deliberations from November 8th to 15th, and would widely mobilize the Japanese people to oppose the Nobusuke Kishi group's conspiracy to illegally extend the Diet session in order to pass the "Amendment to the Police Officer Duty Execution Law."

The struggle policy determined by the meeting stipulates that on the 8th and 9th, all Socialist Party members of the House of Representatives will hold parades in Tokyo, advocating that "the resolution to extend the Diet session is invalid"; on the 10th and 11th, all Diet members will give speeches on the streets of Tokyo, calling on the Japanese people to oppose the resolution to extend the Diet session; from the 13th to the 15th, with the National Conference Against the Vicious Revision of the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law" as the core, ten million people will be mobilized to hold national rallies throughout the country.

The meeting also decided that all Socialist Party members of the House of Councillors would be dispersed to various regions from November 8th to participate in campaigns to arouse public opinion, in order to create a climax advocating that the resolution to extend the Diet session is invalid and demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

Kaoru Ota, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and representatives of other trade unions met with leading cadres of the Socialist Party on the afternoon of the 7th, expressing their support for the Socialist Party's decision and demanding that the Socialist Party not compromise with the Liberal Democratic Party on the issue of extending the Diet session.

The All Japan Trade Union Congress also expressed to the Socialist Party that it would, like the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, support the Socialist Party's struggle policy.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th, Tokyo Dispatch: Shigejiro Suzuki, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, pointed out at a press conference held in Tokyo on the 7th that the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet's policy of unilaterally extending the Diet session to forcibly pass the "Amendment to the Police Officer Duty Execution Law" and a series of other policies that undermine parliamentary politics and destroy the foundations of democracy, are policies that attempt to make Japan regress to the Tojo Cabinet era. He said that the reactionary policies pursued by Nobusuke Kishi, such as revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," are tantamount to conducting a "slow coup" within the Diet.

Suzuki reiterated that the Socialist Party firmly does not recognize the resolution of the Nobusuke Kishi group to extend the Diet session, which fundamentally undermines the work of the Diet. He said that the Socialist Party will focus its main efforts on mobilizing public opinion, overthrowing the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, and demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

Suzuki pointed out that it is necessary to concentrate the strength of the Japanese people so that the Liberal Democratic Party cannot unilaterally deliberate bills in the Diet. He said that relying solely on the struggle in the Diet cannot dissolve the Diet. He pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the opposition forces outside the Diet, first of all to broadly organize the labor front and launch a movement to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet and force it to dissolve the Diet. He hoped that Japanese workers would carry out more powerful and large-scale struggles than the joint struggle on November 5th.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Joint Struggle Conference Against the Vicious Revision of the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law" in the Nishiyodogawa district of Osaka held a rally on the evening of the 7th at the Himejima sports ground in Nishiyodogawa Ward, with about 1,500 people participating, to oppose the Nobusuke Kishi government's revision of the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law" and protest the police's abuse of power to persecute three young people who opposed the revision of the police law.

After the end of the rally, the participants also held a lantern demonstration. When the marching crowd marched between the Nishiyodogawa Police Station and Kanzakiko Port while ringing bells, the Osaka Prefectural Police Headquarters dispatched many police officers to monitor them.

The incident of persecution of young people in Osaka shows that Nobusuke Kishi is making every effort to suppress the Japanese people from "talking about state affairs." On the evening of November 5th, the very day that the Japanese people carried out an unprecedented joint struggle against the Nobusuke Kishi government's revision of the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law," three Japanese youths were standing in front of a theater in Nishiyodogawa Ward, Osaka, talking, and they said they wanted to oppose the revision of the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law," and one youth said that it was a very bad bill. As a result, they were arrested and illegally interrogated by patrolling police officers who heard them talking.

The Osaka Prefectural Branch Federation of the Socialist Party has already protested to the Osaka Nishiyodogawa Police Station against the police's abuse of power and infringement of human rights, and will also investigate the responsibility of the Osaka Prefectural Police Headquarters. The Osaka Prefectural Branch Federation of the Socialist Party held an executive committee meeting today and decided to fight against the Nobusuke Kishi government and the National Public Safety Commission, and also to submit this issue of police infringement of human rights to the Socialist Party's extraordinary congress scheduled to be held on November 12th for discussion.

    坚决粉碎岸信介修改警官法阴谋
    日本社会党积极发动群众斗争
    声明关于延长国会会期的决议无效
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本社会党7日晚上在东京举行了中央执行委员会紧急会议和国会议员全体会议。会议发表声明说，第三十次国会临时会议到7日已经结束。“警察官职务执行法修正案”遭到了舆论猛烈的反击，审议工作还没有结束；这个法案已经作废。
    声明说，关于延长国会会期的决议是无效的。社会党要追究众议院议长星岛二郎和副议长椎熊三郎的责任，并且要求他们立即辞职。
    声明说，为了防止日本走上法西斯和战争的道路，为了维护民主和保卫和平，社会党要用全党的力量，站在国民的最前列，为解散国会、打倒岸信介内阁而斗争。
    社会党今天再次举行了社会党国会议员会议，决定组织一个以赤松勇为团长的约五十人的抗议团到国会去追究岸信介首相和众议院议长星岛、副议长椎熊的责任。
    会后，全体与会者到街头举行了游行。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天在东京举行了委员长和局长会议，决定全体社会党议员从11月8日到15日拒绝参加国会的一切审议工作，并且要广泛发动日本人民反对岸信介集团非法延长国会会期以便通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”的阴谋。
    会议决定的斗争方针规定，8日和9日，全体社会党的众议员将在东京都内举行游行，主张“延长国会会期的决议无效”；10日和11日，全体议员在东京的街道上发表演说，呼吁日本人民反对延长国会会期的决议；13日到15日，以反对恶劣修改“警察官职务执行法”国民会议为核心，在全国各地动员一千万人举行国民集会。
    会议还决定，全体社会党的参议员从11月8日起分散到各地去参加唤起舆论的运动，以掀起一个主张延长国会会期的决议无效、要求解散国会的高潮。
    日本工会总评议会议长太田熏和其它各工会代表7日下午会见社会党的领导干部，表示支持社会党的决定，并且要求社会党不要在延长国会会期的问题上同自由民主党妥协。
    全日本工会会议也对社会党表示，它要同日本工会总评议会一样，支持社会党的斗争方针。
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎7日在东京举行记者招待会上指出，岸信介内阁所奉行的为强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”片面延长国会会期等等一连串摧残议会政治、破坏民主基础的政策，是企图使日本倒退到东条内阁时代去的政策。他说，岸信介所奉行的修改日美“安全条约”等等这样一些反动政策，等于在国会内部进行“缓慢的政变”。
    铃木再次表示，社会党坚决不承认岸信介集团从根本上破坏议会工作的延长国会会期的决议。他说，社会党要把主要的力量放在发动舆论、打倒岸信介内阁和要求解散国会方面。
    铃木指出，有必要集中日本国民的力量，使自由民主党不能够在国会片面进行审议法案的工作。他说，只靠国会里的斗争不能使国会解散。他指出，有必要加强国会外面的反对力量，首先要广泛组织劳工战线，展开打倒岸信介内阁和迫使它解散国会的运动。他希望日本工人进行比11月5日的联合斗争更强有力的大规模的实力斗争。
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本大阪西淀川地区反对恶劣修改“警察官职务执行法”联合斗争会议，7日晚上在西淀川区姬岛运动场举行了约有一千五百人参加的奋起大会，反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”，抗议警察滥用权力迫害反对修改警察法的三个青年。
    大会结束以后，与会者还举行了提灯示威游行。当游行队伍敲着钟在西淀川警察署和神崎港之间游行的时候，大阪府警察本部又出动了许多警察进行监视。
    在大阪发生的迫害青年的事件说明，岸信介正在竭力镇压日本人民“莫谈国是”。11月5日，就是日本全国人民进行规模空前的反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”联合斗争的当天晚上，有三个日本青年站在大阪西淀川区的一家戏院前面谈话，他们说要反对修改“警察官职务执行法”，有一个青年说那是一个很坏的法案。于是就被听到他们谈话的巡逻警察逮去进行了非法盘问。
    社会党大阪府支部联合会7日已就警察滥用职权侵犯人权的非法行为向大阪西淀川警察署提出抗议，并且还要追究大阪府警察本部的责任。社会党大阪府支部联合会今天举行了执行委员会会议，决定要向岸信介政府和国家公安委员会进行斗争，同时还要把这一警察侵犯人权的问题提交预定在11月12日举行的社会党临时大会讨论。（附图片）
    10月24日夜间，日本八千工人提着灯举行示威游行反对岸信介修改警官法。
