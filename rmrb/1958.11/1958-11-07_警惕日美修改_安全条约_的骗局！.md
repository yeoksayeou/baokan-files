Beware of the US-Japan plot to revise the "Security Treaty"!
    Since the beginning of October, the Japanese government of Nobusuke Kishi and the United States government have been conducting negotiations in Tokyo on the issue of revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

    According to a report by Japan's Jiji Press on October 27, certain individuals close to the Kishi Nobusuke government revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the United States have reached agreement in principle on many issues. The revised US-Japan treaty will grant the United States the legal right to militarily control Japan. The two sides have agreed to include in the agreement that the United States has an "obligation to defend Japan." At the same time, according to the news agency, based on the fact that the Japanese ruling group's suppression machine has been greatly strengthened and the United States has exclusively occupied Japanese military bases, the United States seems to be able to consider deleting the clause in the current "Security Treaty" that the US military has the right to suppress Japanese democratic movements in principle. Furthermore, it is said that the United States has also indicated that in principle it can agree to consult with Japan in advance regarding the transfer and deployment of US troops stationed in Japan. Regarding the issue of whether Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands under US occupation should be included in the US-Japan "joint defense area," Jiji Press said that the Kishi Nobusuke government supports the application of the revised "Security Treaty" to these islands. According to a revelation from the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" some time ago, the so-called US-Japan "joint defense treaty" planned by the Kishi Nobusuke government will include: Japan will "cooperate" with the United States when the US military takes action as a "United Nations force," or when the Japanese and American governments reach a comprehensive agreement on the actions to be taken by the United States regarding the situation in the Far East. According to a draft of the new treaty formulated by the US government revealed by the United Press International, Japan also has an obligation to take action with the United States to deal with "common dangers." Recent news from Tokyo and Washington confirms that the United States is preparing to expand the US-Japan "joint defense area" not only to Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, but also to the entire Western Pacific, according to the new treaty. This further exposes what the so-called US-Japan "cooperation" is all about.

    From this, it can be seen that the so-called revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" that Kishi Nobusuke has been touting recently, to promote Japan's "independence" and to have "equal say" in the activities of the US military stationed in Japan, is actually a big scam. All of the above circumstances indicate that this so-called revision is actually to turn the US-Japan "Security Treaty" into a "bilateral" US-Japan military treaty in the nature of a "joint defense treaty." According to this new treaty, the United States will be able to continue to station armed forces in Japan under the guise of "defending Japan," occupy Japanese military bases for a long time, and make Japan a base for the United States to carry out aggression against China and Asia. Not only that, but the United States may also use the pretext that Japan has an obligation to take action with the United States to deal with "common dangers" to intensify Japan's militarization, arm Japan's army with nuclear weapons, and, when the United States deems it necessary, send Japanese troops to Taiwan in our country and even to any region in the "Western Pacific region" to act as an accomplice in US military aggression. In other words, it is to revive Japanese militarism, make Japan a pawn for the United States to carry out aggression, and pull chestnuts out of the fire for US imperialism.

    If this "bilateral" military treaty between the United States and Japan can be realized, the United States will in fact link Japan with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and other military treaties, including even the US-Chiang military alliance. The "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization," which the United States has been planning for a long time, will also be formed in fact. Because the United States can tie Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek group, and the Syngman Rhee group together through the three "bilateral" military treaties between the United States and Japan, the United States and Chiang, and the United States and South Korea, and become tools for the United States to carry out aggression in the Far East.

    The statement that the United States has agreed in principle to consult with Japan in advance regarding the transfer and deployment of US troops stationed in Japan is actually a smokescreen used by US imperialism to deceive the Japanese people. Japanese public opinion has pointed out that countless facts in the past have proved that the United States will not consult with Japan before carrying out military aggression activities in an emergency. On the contrary, the United States can use "consultation" as a pretext to drive Japan to act as an accomplice in aggression. As for the US military handing over all the "power" to suppress the Japanese democratic movement to the Japanese government, this only proves that, in the eyes of the United States, the Kishi Nobusuke government is already competent to act as the executioner to suppress the Japanese people. The current Kishi Nobusuke government is preparing to control the Japanese Diet and forcibly pass the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law Amendment," making Japan a police state again. If Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracy succeeds, he will then amend the constitution, expand armaments, deprive the Japanese people of the little rights they have left, revive Japanese militarism, and completely drag Japan back to the old road of imperialism.

    It is by no means accidental that the US reactionaries are currently eager to revise the "US-Japan Security Treaty." This does not reflect their strength, but rather their approaching doom. Recently, after US imperialism suffered a series of defeats in the Middle East, the Near East, and especially the Taiwan Strait region, the original form of its paper tiger has been completely exposed, it has fallen into unprecedented isolation in the world, and its position has become unstable. In order to reverse its decline and launch new aggression in Asia, US imperialism is further controlling those countries that have treaty relations with it, instigating military coups through the reactionaries of these countries, strengthening fascist rule, and forcing these countries to implement policies that more closely follow the United States, so as to realize its conspiracy of using Asians to fight Asians. This time, the United States' eagerness to drag Japan into the water is a major component of its new aggressive and expansionist conspiracy in Asia. And it is not at all surprising that Kishi Nobusuke is willing to follow the United States into the water. This is the inevitable result of Kishi Nobusuke's consistent adherence to a latent imperialist policy. Kishi Nobusuke believes that further colluding with the United States can save Japan's increasingly serious economic crisis, suppress the dissatisfaction and resistance of the Japanese people, and realize the imperialist expansion ambitions of Japanese monopoly capital. However, Kishi Nobusuke's calculation is completely wrong. US imperialism will never harm its own interests to suit Japan's interests, but will only harm Japan's interests to suit the interests of the United States. The United States can only allow Japanese militarists to act as its slaves, but will never allow Japan to become a partner equal to the United States. Whether it is the US reactionaries or the Japanese reactionaries, their attempt to save their crisis and realize their respective aggressive ambitions by revising the "US-Japan Security Treaty" is impossible. On the contrary, the result of their doing so will further expand the conflict of interest between them, promote the upsurge of the Japanese people's movement for independence, democracy, and peace, and promote the further awakening of the Asian people to oppose US aggression and Japanese expansion. The US reactionaries will become the best negative teachers for the Japanese and Asian people.

    Currently, under the promotion of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese Socialist Party, and Japanese patriots, the Japanese people have launched a massive movement to demand the abolition of the "US-Japan Security Treaty." The broad masses of Japanese working people, intellectuals, and some middle and small bourgeoisie have been involved in this movement, and even some enlightened people in the Japanese government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have expressed their opposition to Kishi Nobusuke's approach. This fully proves that the US reactionaries' plot to revise the "US-Japan Security Treaty" cannot cover up the eyes of the Japanese people. The negative teaching materials they constantly provide to the Japanese people will only prompt the Japanese people to rise up more resolutely to fight.

    The Chinese people firmly support the Japanese people's movement to demand the abolition of the "US-Japan Security Treaty" and oppose being a cannon fodder for the United States. The Chinese people have always been concerned about the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and peace, and against the revival of militarism. China has long pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's latent imperialist policy, if not stopped, will lead the Japanese nation to the disaster of war and destruction. Today, this danger has been unprecedentedly increased, and Kishi Nobusuke's latent imperialist policy has been made public and overt. This not only concerns the fate of the Japanese people, but also seriously threatens China's security and Asian peace. The Chinese people and the Asian people cannot but express serious concern about this and maintain the greatest vigilance. We once again warn the Kishi Nobusuke government that your collusion between US imperialism and Japan will never end well. Isn't Tojo Hideki's end thirteen years ago a lesson for you? In today's world situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the lifespan of US imperialism is not long. If you follow the United States as accomplices, you will not only not gain any advantages, but you will only end up lifting a stone to drop it on your own feet.

### 警惕日美修改“安全条约”的骗局！

    警惕日美修改“安全条约”的骗局！
    从10月初旬起，日本岸信介政府和美国政府，在东京进行了修改日美“安全条约”问题的谈判。
    据日本时事通讯社10月27日报道，某些接近岸信介政府的人士透露，岸信介政府同美国的谈判，已在很多问题上达成原则性的协议。修改后的日美条约将给予美国在军事上控制日本的合法权利。双方已经商定，将在协定中写明美国有“保卫日本的义务”。同时，据该社透露，从日本统治集团的镇压机器已经大大加强和美国已经独霸日本军事基地的事实出发，美国似已在原则上可以考虑从现行的“安全条约”中删去美军有权镇压日本民主运动的条款。并且，据云美国还表示在原则上可以同意驻日美军的调动和部署，事先要同日本协商。关于美军占领下的冲绳和小笠原群岛是否划入美日“共同防御地区”的问题，时事通讯社说，岸信介政府赞成修改后的“安全条约”适用于这些岛屿。又据日本“读卖新闻”在前一些时候的透露，岸信介政府拟议中的所谓日美“共同防御条约”将包括：在美军作为“联合国部队”采取行动的时候，或者在日美两国政府就美国对远东局势要采取的行动问题达成全面协议的时候，日本将同美国“合作”。据美国合众国际社透露的美国政府拟订的新条约草案也规定，日本有义务和美国一道采取行动，对付“共同的危险”。最近从东京和华盛顿传出的消息证实，美国方面正准备根据新的条约，把日美“联合防御地区”不仅扩大到冲绳和小笠原群岛，而且还要扩大到整个西太平洋。这就进一步暴露了所谓日美“合作”的内幕究竟是怎么一回事了。
    由此可见，岸信介最近大肆吹嘘的所谓修改日美“安全条约”是为了发扬日本的“独立性”，是为了对驻日美军的活动有“平等的发言权”等说法，原来是一场大骗局。所有以上这些情况都说明，这次的所谓修改，实际上就是将日美“安全条约”变成“共同防御条约”性质的“双边”的日美军事条约。根据这一新的条约，美国将有可能利用“保卫日本”的名义，继续在日本驻扎武装部队，长期霸占日本的军事基地，使日本成为美国对中国和亚洲进行侵略的作战和供应基地。不仅如此，美国还有可能利用日本有义务同美国一道采取行动、对付“共同危险”的名义，加紧日本的军国主义化，以核武器武装日本的军队，并且当美国认为需要的时候，把日本军队派到我国的台湾以至“西太平洋地域”的任何地区，充当美国军事侵略的帮凶。换一句话说，就是复活日本军国主义，使日本充当美国进行侵略的炮灰，为美帝国主义火中取栗。
    如果日美间的这一“双边”的军事条约能够实现，美国将事实上把日本同东南亚条约组织、北大西洋条约组织以及其他军事条约，其中甚至包括美蒋军事同盟联结起来。美国蓄谋已久的“东北亚条约组织”，于此也将在事实上形成。因为，美国通过美日、美蒋、美李三个“双边”军事条约这根绳子，就可以把日本、蒋介石集团和李承晚集团套在一起，成为美国在远东进行侵略的工具。
    美国在原则上同意驻日美军的调动和部署，事先要同日本协商这一说法，实际上是美帝国主义欺骗日本人民的一套障眼法。日本的舆论已经指出，过去无数的事实证明，在紧急的情况下，美国在进行军事侵略活动以前是不会同日本协商的。相反的，美国却可以利用“协商”为名，驱使日本充当侵略的帮凶。至于美军把镇压日本民主运动的“权力”全部移交给日本政府，这只不过是证明，在美国的心目中，岸信介政府已经可以胜任充当镇压日本人民的刽子手了。目前岸信介政府正准备控制日本国会，强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”，使日本重新成为警察国家。如果岸信介的这一阴谋得逞，接着他就将修改宪法，扩张军备，剥夺日本人民仅存的一点权利，复活日本军国主义，把日本完全拉回到帝国主义的老路上去。
    美国反动派目前急欲修改“日美安全条约”，这绝不是偶然的。这不是反映它们的强大，而是反映他们的日暮途穷。最近，美帝国主义在中近东特别是台湾海峡地区遭受了一连串失败以后，他的纸老虎的原形已经彻底暴露，他在世界上已经陷于空前的孤立，他的阵脚已经呈现不稳。美帝国主义为了挽回他的颓势和在亚洲方面发动新的侵略，正在进一步控制那些同他有条约关系的国家，通过这些国家的反动派策动军事政变，加强法西斯统治，迫使这些国家执行更加追随美国的政策，以便实现他利用亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋。这次美国急于要拉日本下水，正是他在亚洲进行新的侵略扩张阴谋的一个主要组成部分。而岸信介所以甘愿跟着美国下水，也是丝毫不奇怪的。这是岸信介一贯坚持潜在的帝国主义政策的必然结果。岸信介自以为同美国进一步勾结，就可以解救日本日益严重的经济危机，镇压日本人民的不满和反抗，实现日本垄断资本的帝国主义的扩张野心。但是，岸信介的算盘是完全打错了。美帝国主义决不会损害自己的利益，来适合日本的利益，而只会损害日本的利益，来适合美国的利益。美国只能容许日本军国主义分子充当他的奴才，而决不会容许日本成为同美国平起平坐的伙伴。不管是美国反动派也好，日本反动派也好，他们妄图通过修改“日美安全条约”来挽救自己的危机，实现各自的侵略野心，这是办不到的。相反的，他们这样做的结果，将会更加扩大他们之间的利害冲突，促进日本人民争取独立、民主、和平运动的高涨，并且推动亚洲人民更加觉醒起来反对美国的侵略和日本的扩张。美国反动派将成为日本人民和亚洲人民最好的反面教员。
    目前，在日本共产党、日本社会党和日本爱国人士的推动下，日本人民已经展开了声势浩大的要求废除“日美安全条约”的运动。广大的日本劳动人民、知识分子和一部分中、小资产阶级已经卷入了这一运动，就连日本政府和执政的自由民主党中的一些有识之士也表示反对岸信介的做法。这就充分证明，美国反动派修改“日美安全条约”的骗局，是掩盖不了日本人民的眼睛的。他们不断向日本人民提供的反面教材，只会促使日本人民更坚决地起来斗争。
    中国人民坚决支持日本人民要求废除“日美安全条约”，反对给美国当炮灰的运动。中国人民一向关怀日本人民争取独立、民主、和平，反对复活军国主义的斗争。中国早就指出岸信介所执行的潜在帝国主义政策，如果不加阻止，就会把日本民族引导到战争和毁灭的灾难中去。今天这种危险是空前地加大了，岸信介的潜在帝国主义政策已经公开化和表面化了。这不仅关系到日本人民的命运，而且严重地威胁着中国的安全和亚洲的和平。中国人民和亚洲人民不能不对此表示严重的关切和保持最大的警惕。我们再一次警告岸信介政府，你们日美帝国主义狼狈为奸是绝不会有什么好的下场的。十三年前东条英机的下场不正是你们前车之鉴吗？在今天东风压倒西风的世界局势下，美帝国主义的寿命已经不长了，你们跟着美国当帮凶，不但不会占到任何便宜，而只会是搬起石头打自己的脚。
