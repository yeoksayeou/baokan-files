What to Teach? Ask the Workers
Xiao Min
    It's certainly a great thing that many factories have started schools and workers can read. However, some factories, even though they have schools, are not necessarily welcomed by the workers. Why is that? Because what is being taught is not very suitable for the needs of production. At present, factory and enterprise production is extremely tight, and workers are very welcome to improve their cultural and technical knowledge level to carry out technical revolution. However, forcing workers to follow the old set of ordinary schools cannot meet the current requirements of the workers. If they study but cannot apply what they learn, the workers will not be able to manage at present.

    There is an example to prove it: The Southwest Radio Equipment Factory initially started a part-work, part-study university, and the teaching materials were copied from a set of ordinary universities. As a result, workers commented: "If we study like this for four years, we will become backward elements. What we can learn in two or three years, others have already learned in production." In fact, there have been quite a few such discussions for a long time. In the past, a worker wrote a limerick saying:

    "The workshop is engaged in mass production, the classroom is reading 'Peach Blossom Spring',
    Production urgently needs to learn trigonometry, follow the steps and wait for senior year three,
    Hard water softening is very useful, search through chemistry and physics and can't find it,
    Education serves production, textbooks should be greatly adapted."

    The workers' few words profoundly illustrate what factories should do in running schools, what to teach, and what to learn. People need education to carry out class struggle and production struggle. Running education and imparting knowledge should serve politics and serve the ultimate goal of production, not education for the sake of education, knowledge for the sake of knowledge. The most advanced workers understand this. Therefore, factories should run schools based on the actual situation of their own factories and listen to the opinions of the workers.

    The schools run by factories are different from full-time schools. Most of the schools run by factories are part-time or part-work, part-study. Workers' learning does not separate from production or only partially separates from production. The workers participating in the study are all adults, and they have relatively rich practical life and production knowledge. Full-time schools are not like this. Obviously, the set of full-time schools cannot be copied in the schools run by factories. Not only can the set of full-time schools not be copied, but the schools run by Factory A cannot be copied by Factory B, because the production conditions of each factory are different. Factory A produces this product, and Factory B produces another product. The different production places different demands on workers' scientific and technical knowledge. Therefore, in addition to basic courses, the setting of professional courses, teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, teaching materials, and the length of schooling should be based on the characteristics and needs of the factory, advocating adapting to local conditions and diversity. Otherwise, even if the school is started, it will have to be reformed. In this regard, the past vocational education for workers has had profound lessons. Learn from the mistakes of the past, and don't take detours again.

    What to do? Listen to the opinions of the workers and follow the mass line. From the length of schooling, teaching content, textbook compilation, school management to scientific research, factory-run schools should adopt the "three-way combination" method of teachers, students, workers, and engineers and technicians under the leadership of the Party committee. However, some people believe that workers have no knowledge and are laymen in teaching. They cannot put forward complete opinions and say "a few words are nothing." We must shout loudly, these people are wrong. Workers have clear learning goals and are familiar with the factory's production situation. Even if some workers can only say "a few words" about teaching work, they often point out the key problems existing in teaching. Wasn't it because the Southwest Radio Equipment Factory had workers say that the factory production needed kiln furnace science, but the original teaching plan did not have this course, that kiln furnace science was added? Wasn't the teaching reform of this factory carried out after a mass discussion and airing of views, the Party committee listened to the opinions of workers, engineers and technicians, and teachers, and concentrated the wisdom of the masses, canceled, merged, and reduced certain majors and teaching materials, and shortened the length of schooling, that the school was run well?

    From this, we can draw a conclusion that the mass line is the line of victory for all work, and it is also the line for factory-run schools. When running a school, when discussing what to teach and what to learn, we must firmly remember the principle of "from the masses, to the masses."

    教什么？问问工人
    箫敏
    许多工厂办起了学校，工人有书读了，这当然是顶大的好事。但是，有的工厂虽然有了学校，工人却不一定很欢迎它。为什么呢？因为教的东西不大适合生产的需要。目前各工厂企业生产极为紧张，提高文化技术知识水平来闹技术革命，工人很欢迎。可是硬要工人按部就班，学普通学校的老一套，就不能满足工人当前的要求，学了不能致用，工人目前就无法兼顾了。
    有例为证：西南无线电器材厂当初办起了一所半工半读大学，教材是搬的普通大学的一套，于是工人议论了：“这样学习四年，我们会变成落后分子了。我们两三年后才能学到的，别人早在生产中学会了。”其实，像这样的议论早就有不少了。过去，有一位工人曾写过一首打油诗，曰：
    “车间搞的大生产，课堂读的‘桃花源’，
    生产急需学三角，按部就班等高三，
    硬水软化用处大，翻遍理化找不见，
    教育服务于生产，教材应该大改编。”
    工人同志的几句话，很深刻地说明了工厂办的学校究竟应该怎么办？教些什么和学些什么？人们是为了进行阶级斗争和生产斗争而需要教育的。办教育传授知识，应当服务于政治，服务于生产这个最终目的，不是为教育而教育，为知识而知识。先进的工人最懂得这个。因此，工厂办学应当从本厂的实际出发，多听听工人的意见。
    工厂办的学校与全日制的学校不同。工厂办的学校多半是业余的或半工半读的，工人学习是不脱离生产或半脱离生产的，参加学习的工人都是成人，他们有比较丰富的实际生活和生产知识。全日制的学校就不是这样。显然，工厂办的学校是不能照搬全日制学校的一套。不仅不能照搬全日制学校的一套，而且甲厂办的学校，乙厂也不能照搬，因为各厂之间生产条件不同，甲厂生产这种产品，乙厂生产别种产品，生产的不同，对于工人科学技术知识的要求就不一样。因此，除了基础课之外，专业课程的设置、教学计划、教学大纲、教材、学制等应当从本厂的特点、需要出发，提倡因厂制宜，多种多样。否则，即使办起了学校，也不能不进行改革。这点，过去的职工业余教育是有较深教训的。前车之辙，后车之鉴，不要再走弯路。
    怎么办呢？多听听工人的意见，走群众路线。工厂办学从学制、教学内容、教材编写、学校管理直到科学研究，应当采取在党委领导下师生、工人和工程技术人员“三结合”的方法。但是，有些人却认为工人没有知识，对于教学是外行，不能提出成套的意见，说个“三言两语，没啥”。我们要大喝一声，这些人错了。工人学习有明确的学习目的，对工厂的生产情况熟悉，纵然有的工人对于教学工作只能说个“三言两语”，但却往往一针见血，点破教学中存在的关键问题。西南无线电器材厂不是因为有了工人说工厂生产需要窑炉学，而原来教学计划没有这门课程这句话，才增设了窑炉学吗？这个厂的教学改革不是经过群众性的讨论鸣放，党委听取了工人、工程技术人员、教师的意见，集中群众的智慧，取消、合并、精减了某些专业、教材，缩短了学习年限，才把学校办好的吗？
    由此得出一个结论，群众路线是一切工作胜利的路线，也是工厂办学的路线。在办学的时候，在商订教什么、学什么的时候，要牢牢记住从群众中来，再到群众中去的这个原则。
