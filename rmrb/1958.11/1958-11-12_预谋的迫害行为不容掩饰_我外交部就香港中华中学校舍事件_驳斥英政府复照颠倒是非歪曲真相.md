Xinhua News Agency, November 11th - Our Foreign Ministry today sent a note to the British government, refuting the British government's reply of October 9th this year regarding the Hong Kong British authorities' forceful closure of the Hong Kong Chung Wah Middle School.

The Foreign Ministry's note pointed out: The British government's reply of October 9th, offering explanations for the Hong Kong British authorities' forceful closure of the Chung Wah Middle School and the Hong Kong police's brutal beating of the school's faculty, staff, students, and Chinese news reporters present at the scene, is completely unacceptable. The truth cannot be concealed. As pointed out in the Foreign Ministry's note of August 27th, since the beginning of this year, after the promulgation of the Education (Amendment) Ordinance, the Hong Kong British authorities have carried out many acts of sabotage and persecution against the educational endeavors and educators of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon under various pretexts; and this forceful closure of the Chung Wah Middle School is another deliberate act of sabotage and persecution against the educational endeavors of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon under the pretext of "dangerous buildings." The Hong Kong British authorities first deliberately delayed the Chung Wah Middle School's request to repair the school building, then issued a closure order, coercing the school to close and students to transfer, and then dispatched police to use violence to forcibly close the school building, beating the school's faculty, staff, students, and Chinese news reporters present at the scene. This is clearly a premeditated act of persecution, and it cannot be explained away as a normal housing repair issue. As for the police's acts of violence, not only have the Chinese residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon witnessed it, but there are also photos taken by reporters present at the scene as evidence. The British government's reply cannot but admit that the Hong Kong police did use force against the school's teachers, students, and Chinese news reporters. However, the British government's reply unreasonably accused our Foreign Ministry's note of containing "completely unfounded claims." This is a complete reversal of right and wrong, and a distortion of the truth, to which the Chinese government expresses its regret.

The Foreign Ministry's note continued: The Chinese government has noted that the Hong Kong British authorities have already unsealed the Chung Wah Middle School. It has also noted that in the conversation between Chargé d'Affaires Wen Yusheng and Deputy Director of the Western European Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry, Song Zhiguang, it was stated that some of the textbooks stipulated by the Hong Kong British authorities were already "outdated" and would be revised, and that Hong Kong schools could use textbooks outside of the textbook directory. However, the British government's reply did not provide a satisfactory answer to the relevant requests put forward in the Foreign Ministry's note of August 27th.

The Foreign Ministry's note concluded: The British government's reply did not even mention the Hong Kong British authorities' connivance with Chiang Kai-shek's group in engaging in conspiratorial activities in Hong Kong and Kowloon under the guise of running schools, opposing and undermining the People's Republic of China, and creating "two Chinas." The Chinese government believes it is necessary to reiterate the relevant requests in the Foreign Ministry's note of August 27th and bring them to the attention of the British government.

    预谋的迫害行为不容掩饰
    我外交部就香港中华中学校舍事件
    驳斥英政府复照颠倒是非歪曲真相
    新华社11日讯　我国外交部今日照会英国政府，驳斥英国政府今年10月9日关于香港英国当局强行封闭香港中华中学校舍事件的复照。
    我外交部照会指出：英国政府10月9日的复照，对香港英国当局强行封闭中华中学校舍和香港警察野蛮殴打该校教职员、学生和在场采访的中国新闻记者事件所作的解释是完全不能接受的。事实真相不容掩饰。正如外交部8月27日照会中所指出，今年初以来，香港英国当局在颁布教育（修正）条例后，就在各种借口下对港九中国人民的教育事业和教育工作者进行过多次的摧残和迫害；而这次强行封闭中华中学校舍事件是在“危险房屋”的借口下对港九中国人民教育事业的又一次蓄意摧残和迫害行为。香港英国当局先则故意拖延中华中学校方提出的修缮校舍要求，继而颁发封闭令，胁迫学校停办，学生转学，随后又出动警察使用暴力强行封闭校舍，殴打该校教职员、学生和在场采访的中国新闻记者，这显然是预谋的迫害行为，而绝不是可以用通常的房屋修缮问题来作解释的。至于警察行凶情事，不仅港九中国居民有目共睹，而且也有在场记者拍摄的照片为证。英国政府复照中也不能不承认香港警察确曾对该校师生和中国新闻记者使用了武力。但是，英国政府复照中却反无理指责我外交部照会中包含了“完全没有根据的说法”。这完全是颠倒是非，歪曲事实真相，中国政府对此表示遗憾。
    我外交部照会继续指出：中国政府注意到香港英国当局已经将中华中学校舍加以启封。同时注意到文郁生代办同外交部西欧司宋之光副司长谈话中表示，香港英国当局规定的教科书有的已经“过时”，将予修改，香港学校可以使用教科书目录单以外的课本。但是，英国政府的复照对外交部8月27日照会中所提出的有关要求并未给予满意的答复。
    我外交部照会最后指出：英国政府复照中更未提及关于香港英国当局纵容蒋介石集团分子假借办学之名在港九进行反对和破坏中华人民共和国和制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动。中国政府认为有必要在此重申我外交部8月27日照会中的有关要求，提请英国政府予以注意。
