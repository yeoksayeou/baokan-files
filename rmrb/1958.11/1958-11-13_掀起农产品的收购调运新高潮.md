Since entering November, the procurement of agricultural products across the country has greatly improved, and the procurement progress has been greatly accelerated. According to incomplete statistics, as of November 9, the national grain procurement has completed 33.5% of the production year's plan, cotton has completed 44.2% of the annual procurement task, flue-cured tobacco has completed 31.3%, and jute has completed 44.8%. However, judging from the overall situation, the procurement work is still far from the annual task, and there are still imbalances within the scope of a province and in the variety of procurement. There are still many problems to be further resolved in the processing, storage, and transportation of the agricultural products that have been purchased. Now, the late autumn crops have mostly entered the market, and the procurement of agricultural products is facing a decisive stage. In order to procure agricultural products according to plan in the next month or so, the local party committees need to further strengthen their leadership, and the financial and trade departments need to make great efforts.

How to make reasonable arrangements for commercial work when the Marshal of Steel takes office is a very important issue. Correctly understanding this issue is of great significance to the current large-scale purchase and sale work. Generally speaking, it is "one 'give way', two 'support', and three 'squeeze'." "Give way" means to give way to time, labor, and transportation capacity to ensure the marshal's ascension and pave the way for the vanguard; "support" means to strengthen collaboration and support the marshal and the vanguard through the purchasing and sales activities of the commercial departments; "squeeze" means to seize the gaps between steel production and agricultural production to actively carry out purchasing, sales, and transportation activities. "Squeeze" is for better "support". "Give way", "support", and "squeeze" are a unity of contradictions and are inseparable. The commercial work's implementation of the principle of "give way", "support", and "squeeze" is also in line with the current objective reality of economic construction.

After the launch of the nationwide steelmaking and large-scale agricultural campaigns, many agricultural products urgently need to be purchased, and many means of production and livelihood also need to be supplied. If the supply work cannot keep up, it will adversely affect steel and agricultural production. However, since it is necessary to give way to the marshal and carry out large-scale purchasing and sales, there will always be some contradictions in between. It is unrealistic to say that there are no contradictions at all. However, where there are contradictions, there must be ways to overcome them. This is to be good at squeezing. And squeezing is precisely for the sake of support. What is squeezing? It means appropriately squeezing out some time, labor, and transportation capacity on the premise of ensuring the "marshal" ascends to power. The specific squeezing method is to combine concentrated procurement with regular procurement, and to combine concentrated transportation with regular transportation; to seize every opportunity, to combine large-scale movements with small-scale movements, and to combine long-term movements with short-term movements; while engaging in steel and agriculture on a large scale, to insert the procurement and transportation movement of agricultural products in the gaps. It should be noted that although labor and transportation capacity are relatively tight after the marshal's ascension, there are still gaps and potential, and conditions are constantly changing. Recently, many places have almost completed deep plowing of the land. In terms of steel production, the current focus is on grasping quality and consolidating and improving small local groups, so the gaps in time, labor, and transportation capacity are larger than in the previous period. It can be seen that emphasizing the further strengthening of the procurement and transfer of agricultural products at the present time has objective conditions.

Correcting the understanding does not mean that we can do a good job in large-scale purchasing and sales. It also depends on what methods you take. The recent shortage of supplies in some areas is not due to the lack of goods, there are many goods, but because the procurement and transportation work cannot keep up for a while, so it appears tight. This is fundamentally different from the nature of past shortages. How can commercial staff adapt to this prosperous situation of tension and learn to do a good job in purchasing and sales in a tense situation? This is a new issue facing commercial workers. Faced with this new situation, there are two fundamentally different approaches. One is to have the Party committee lead and launch a large-scale mass movement. The other is to rely only on a few business departments to carry out purchasing and sales activities. The procurement work in the past period has proved that taking the mass line and launching a large-scale mass movement can continuously create various ways to overcome difficulties, and the procurement work can move forward by leaps and bounds. This year, many regions have created the "four self" methods of self-inspection, self-weighing, self-settlement, and self-storage in the procurement of agricultural products; some regions have adopted the method of organizing transportation corps to carry out large-scale transportation; some regions have adopted the method of launching "satellites" and planting red flags to create a mass-based concentrated procurement and transportation movement with great momentum. Facts have proved that these methods can not only purchase quickly and purchase more, but also purchase well and transport quickly. Although some of the above methods are different, they have one thing in common, that is, the procurement work is carried out by mass movement methods. Learning to use the form of mass movement to carry out purchasing, sales, and transportation activities is an important key to doing a good job in current commercial work.

At present, in areas where procurement is better, some agricultural products have almost completed the procurement plan. We must not slacken our efforts in these areas. We must purchase all the agricultural products that should be purchased, and pay attention to solving quality problems in the procurement process. The procurement of agricultural products is a meticulous and huge organizational work, which must be linked one after another, and one wave after another. Any problems in any link will cause uncoordinated phenomena. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the weak links of processing and transportation. The most important thing is to expand processing capacity and resolutely eliminate the phenomenon of having vehicles without goods in transportation work. Because agricultural products must not only be purchased, but also transported out in order to supply the needs of industrial production and people's lives. This is an issue that should be paid special attention to at present. It should also be pointed out that the procurement plans for native and sideline products have not been completed well in many regions. We must pay attention to grasping the procurement. Otherwise, native and sideline products may be squeezed out. This is unfavorable for completing the state's export plan and meeting the diverse needs of the people.

The bumper harvest of agricultural production has increased the purchasing power of the market considerably. According to some survey materials, the demand for means of production in many regions has increased by multiples or even several times this year. The widespread establishment of people's commune canteens, nurseries, sewing groups, schools, and medical institutions has increased the demand for commodities in terms of variety and quantity. This year, the state's commodity inventory has increased a lot compared with the same period last year. This is a favorable material basis for doing a good job in large-scale sales, but it is still insufficient for some varieties. The difference between the inventory of means of production and the actual needs is relatively large. On the premise of ensuring the country's key construction, we should adopt the method of self-reliance, using local materials, local processing, and local supply. As long as it is done well, it can basically meet the supply. For consumer goods, except for a few planned supply commodities, the rest should be supplied without reservation. If we want to supply a large number of commodities to the masses in a timely manner, we must also continuously improve the supply methods.

Winter has arrived, and commercial departments in various regions must, under the leadership of the Party, earnestly do a good job in the supply of winter commodities, and pay special attention to ensuring that the steel and water conservancy armies are well-fed and clothed, and ensure the victorious completion of the steel and farmland water conservancy tasks.

### 掀起农产品的收购调运新高潮

    掀起农产品的收购调运新高潮
    进入11月份以来，全国各地农产品收购工作有了很大起色，收购进度大大加快。根据不完全的统计，迄至11月9日为止，全国粮食收购已经完成生产年度计划的33.5％，棉花完成了全年收购任务的44.2％，烤烟完成了31.3％，黄麻完成了44.8％。但从总的情况来看，收购工作距离全年的任务还相差很远，在一个省的范围内和收购的品种上都还存在着不平衡的现象。已经收购起来的农产品在加工、保管、运输等方面也还有许多问题需要进一步解决。现在晚秋作物已经大部登场，农产品收购工作面临着决战阶段。要在今后一个多月的时间内按照计划把农产品收购起来，还需要各地党委进一步加强领导和财贸部门进行巨大的努力。
    商业工作在钢铁元帅升帐的情况下怎样进行合理安排，这是一个很重要的问题，正确地认识这一问题对于当前大购大销工作具有重要意义。概括地说，是一“让”二“援”三“挤”。让是让时间、让劳动力、让运输力，保证元帅升帐，为先行开路；援是加强协作，通过商业部门的购销活动支援元帅和先行；挤是要利用钢铁生产和农业生产的空隙挤上去，积极开展购销和调运活动。挤是为了更好地援。让、援、挤，这是矛盾的统一体，是不可分割的。商业工作执行让、援、挤的方针也是符合当前经济建设的客观实际的。
    全民炼钢和大搞农业运动开展起来以后，许多农产品急需收购，同时许多生产和生活资料也都需要供应，供应工作如果跟不上去就会使钢铁和农业生产受到不利的影响。可是既要给元帅让路，又要开展大购大销，这中间多少总是有些矛盾的。说完全没有矛盾是不合实际的。然而有矛盾就必有克服矛盾的办法。这就是要善于挤。而挤也正是为了援。何谓挤？在保证“元帅”升帐的前提下，适当地挤出一部分时间、劳动力和运输力。具体的挤法是突击收购和经常收购相结合，突击运输和经常运输相结合；见缝就插针，大运动套小运动，长运动套短运动；在大搞钢铁和农业的同时，利用空隙插入农产品的收购和调运运动。应该看到，元帅升帐以后，劳动力、运输力虽然比较紧张，但空隙和潜力还是有的，而且条件也是在不断起变化的。最近许多地方深翻土地已经接近完成，钢铁生产方面，当前主要是抓质量，抓小土群的巩固和提高，因而时间、劳动力和运输力的空隙比起前一时期要多一些大一些。可见在当前强调进一步加强农产品的收购调动工作，是有客观条件的。
    端正了认识还不等于就能做好大购大销的工作，还要看你采取什么方法。最近某些地区出现的一些物资供应紧张现象，其原因并不是东西少，东西是很多的，只是由于一时收购调运工作跟不上，因而显得紧张。这和过去紧张的性质有根本上的不同。商业工作人员怎样才能适应这种繁荣的紧张局面，学会在紧张的情况下做好购销工作，这是商业工作者面临的一个新的问题。面对这一新的情况有两种根本不同的做法。一种是党委领导，大搞群众运动。另一种是只依靠少数业务部门开展购销活动。过去一段收购工作证明，走群众路线，大搞群众运动，就能不断地创造各种各样克服困难的办法，收购工作就能大踏步前进。今年许多地区在农产品收购工作中就创造了自行验级、自行过秤、自行结算、自行保管的“四自”方法；有些地区采用组织运输兵团的方法大搞运输；有的地区采用放“卫星”插红旗的办法造成声势浩大的群众性突击收购和调运运动。事实证明，这些办法不但能收购得快收购得多，而且收购得好，调运得快。上述的一些办法虽然有些不同，但有一点是相同的，就是收购工作都是采取群众运动的办法。学会运用群众运动的形式开展购销和调运活动，是做好当前商业工作的重要关键。
    目前收购较好的地区，有些农产品已经接近完成收购计划。在这些地区也决不可松劲，我们必须把应该收购的农产品都收购起来，并在收购当中注意解决质量问题。农产品收购工作是一项细致的巨大的组织工作，必须要一环套一环，一浪赶一浪，任何环节发生问题都会发生不协调的现象。因此，必须加强加工和调运这些薄弱环节。最主要的是扩大加工力量，和坚决消灭调运工作中有车无货的现象。因为农产品不仅要收购起来，而且要调运出来，才能供应工业生产和人民生活的需要。这是当前应当特别加以注意的问题。还需要指出的是许多地区土、副产品的收购计划完成得不好。必须注意抓紧收购。不然，土、副产品就有被挤掉的可能。这对于完成国家出口计划和满足人民多方面的需要都是不利的。
    农业生产大丰收给市场增加了不少的购买力，根据一些调查材料来看，今年许多地区对生产资料的需求都有了成倍以至几倍的增长。人民公社食堂、托儿所、缝纫组、学校和医疗机构的普遍建立，对商品的需求在品种、数量等方面都是增加的。今年国家商品库存比去年同时期增加很多，这是做好大销工作的有利的物质基础，但是就某些品种来说还是不足的。其中生产资料的库存和实际需要之间差额是较大的。应该在保证国家重点建设的前提下，采取自力更生的办法，就地取材，就地加工，就地供应，只要搞得好，也能够做到基本上满足供应。对于生活资料，除了少数计划供应的商品以外，其余都应该放手供应。如要把大量的商品及时地供应到群众手里，还必须不断地改进供应方法。
    冬天已经到了，各地商业部门必须在党的领导下切实做好冬令商品的供应工作，特别要注意使钢铁和水利大军吃饱穿暖，保障钢铁和农田水利任务的胜利完成。
