    Creating Films with Good Content, Style, and Sound & Light
    The Film Industry Prepares to Launch Satellites Next Year
    (Our dispatch) From November 1st to 7th, the Ministry of Culture convened a meeting with Shanghai Film Studio and the Beijing, Changchun, August First, Guangzhou, and Xi'an film studios to discuss launching artistic film "satellites" to welcome the 10th anniversary of National Day next year. During the meeting, Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, put forward many important opinions, and Xia Yan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture, made a concluding speech.
    At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that the requirement put forward by the Party Central Committee to produce at least seven color art films reaching the world's advanced level next year is the glorious task of all film workers and a huge driving force to promote greater leaps forward in film art creation. The countless heroic deeds of the people across the country since the Great Leap Forward are an inexhaustible source for film art creation. After the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the film industry, under the guidance of the Party and in the context of this year's Great Leap Forward, closely combined with the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, filmed more newsreels, and created documentary art films. There has been a significant improvement in the ideological level of artistic creation. What is particularly important is that the Party committees in various places attach great importance to the work of film satellite launching, and actively lead and organize the creation of film scripts, which has given the film work a new look. This is a very favorable condition and foundation for launching film satellites next year.
    Everyone unanimously believed that the films presented next year to celebrate the 10th anniversary of National Day should achieve a high degree of ideological content and the most perfect artistry possible. It is necessary to ensure the cutting-edge political themes of our era, create vivid and lively typical examples of new people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and at the same time, to well reflect some major themes of the several revolutionary historical periods led by our Party. The themes should also strive to be broad and diverse; and in terms of artistic form, the method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism should be promoted, with bold creation, improved skills, and striving for rich local and national characteristics, creating films with a more popular national style, and continuing to implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom. Everyone unanimously agreed that the three good requirements put forward by Comrade Zhou Yang: namely, good content (communist ideology), good style (national form), and good sound and light (improvement of various film technologies) are a goal to strive for. It is required that each factory face its own region, go deep into the masses, and at the same time strive to improve artistic expression skills, and create socialist and communist new national films.
    Everyone also believed that many facts prove that film satellite launching must break superstitions, resolutely implement the mass line, widely mobilize the masses, and achieve a combination of professional and amateur creators under the leadership of the Party committee. It is necessary to vigorously rely on the masses and cultivate new forces. At the same time, the ideology of film workers must also be continuously improved. First, "launch satellites" ideologically, so that "satellites" can be launched in creation. In the work of launching satellites, leading comrades of each factory must also personally take action, cultivate "experimental fields" well, create "high-yield records," and drive the overall work.
    In order to make film "satellites" fill the sky, everyone also discussed the communist cooperative relationship between factories, pointing out that old and large factories should launch "satellites," and new and small factories should also launch "satellites." They must closely cooperate with each other; creators and technicians must also strive to launch "satellites," cooperate with each other, and strive to exceed their previous levels. Shanghai Film Studio, Changchun Film Studio, and other old factories have expressed their willingness to do their best to support brother factories and jointly launch "satellites." New factories have also stated that they will strive for self-reliance and strive for advancement.
    The main difficulty that currently exists is the film supply problem. During the meeting, the Ministry of Light Industry was also holding a meeting on photosensitive materials, and good news came that the newly built film factories in various places exerted revolutionary spirit and proposed to guarantee the production of 70 million meters of film to support film production, giving great encouragement to various factories. Although there are only eleven months left until next year's National Day and time is tight, all factories have expressed that they will seize the time, step up action, plan production in a planned way, mobilize manpower and material resources, and have the confidence to complete and strive to over fulfill the task.

    电影界准备明年放卫星
    本报讯　11月1日至7日文化部召集上海电影制片公司与北京、长春、八一、广州、西安等制片厂举行会议，讨论了为迎接明年国庆十周年大放艺术片“卫星”问题。会议期间，中共中央宣传部副部长周扬提出了许多重要意见，文化部副部长夏衍作了总结发言。
    在会议上，大家一致认为党中央提出的明年至少生产出七部赶上世界先进水平的彩色艺术片的要求，是全体电影工作者的光荣任务，是促进电影艺术创作更加跃进的一个巨大的动力。大跃进以来全国人民的无数的英雄事迹，是电影艺术创作的取之不尽的源泉。电影界经过了整风反右斗争，在今年大跃进的形势下执行党的指示，密切结合工农业大跃进多拍摄新闻纪录片，创作纪录性的艺术片，在艺术创作的思想水平上已经有显著的提高，特别重要的是各地党委非常重视电影放卫星的工作，积极领导和组织了电影剧本创作，使得电影工作出现了一个崭新的面貌，这对明年电影放卫星来说，是非常有利的条件和基础。
    大家一致认为：明年为庆祝国庆十周年献礼的影片，应该达到高度的思想性与尽可能完美的艺术性。要保证我们时代的政治尖端题材，创造出生动活泼的敢想敢说敢做的新人的典型，同时，要很好地反映我们党所领导的几个革命历史时期的某些重大题材。题材方面还应该力求广泛多样；而在艺术形式方面，提倡革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的方法，大胆创造，提高技巧，力求富有地方色彩和民族色彩，创造出更加为群众喜闻乐见的民族风格的影片，继续贯彻百花齐放的方针。大家一致认为周扬同志所提出的三好要求：即内容好
  （共产主义思想）、风格好（民族形式）、声光好（电影各种技术的提高）是一个奋斗的目标。要求各厂面向本区，深入群众，同时努力提高艺术表现技巧，创造出社会主义的共产主义的民族新电影。
    大家也认为，许多事实证明，电影放“卫星”必须破除迷信，坚决贯彻群众路线，广泛地动员群众，要做到在党委领导下，专业、业余创作工作者相结合，要大力依靠群众，培养新生力量。同时，电影工作者的思想也必须不断提高，首先在思想上放“卫星”，才能在创作上放出“卫星”来。在放卫星工作中，各厂领导同志还必须亲自动手，种好“试验田”，创造出“高产纪录”，带动全盘工作。
    为了使电影“卫星”满布天空，大家也讨论了各厂的共产主义的协作关系，指出各老厂大厂要放“卫星”，各新厂小厂也要放“卫星”，彼此必须紧密协作；创作人员、技术人员也都要努力放“卫星”，相互协作，争取超过自己以往的水平。上影、长影等老厂都表示尽力支援兄弟厂，共同放“卫星”，各新厂也表示要力求自力更生，力争先进。
    目前所存在的主要困难，是胶片供应问题。在会议期间，轻工业部也正在召开感光材料会议，传来捷报，各地新建的胶片厂发挥革命干劲，提出保证生产七千万公尺胶片支援电影制片，给予各厂极大的鼓舞。虽然目前距离明年国庆仅有十一个月，时间紧迫，但各厂都表示要争取时间，加紧行动，有计划地安排生产，调动人力物力，有信心完成并力争超额完成任务。
