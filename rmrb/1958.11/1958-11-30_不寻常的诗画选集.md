	An Unusual Collection of Poetry and Painting

	Under the leadership of the Wangren Township Party Committee in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, the entire township created 143,400 wall poems and 560 "technology on the wall" paintings in less than a month. There were also 21,340 combined wall poem-paintings. The Wangren Township Party Committee compiled a "Selected Poetry and Painting Collection," which was a selection of 100 works from these 20,000+ pieces, printed by the commune's lithography factory.

	From this collection, we can see that the Wangren Township has achieved great results in the poetry and painting movement. At the same time, we can see that under the leadership of the Party, the working people of our country have not only politically turned over but also culturally. The working masses are the true creators of culture. They have unlimited wisdom and creativity.

	The works selected for this collection include those from the township Party committee secretary to ordinary farmers, women, and old ladies. All seven township Party committee secretaries took the lead in writing and painting. The first secretary, Comrade Tao Yehua, once wrote eleven poems in one night and personally revised painting drafts. One of his poems, "People's Hearts Lean Towards the Communist Party," reads:

	Red flags flutter towards the East,
	Sunflowers bloom towards the sun,
	People's hearts lean towards the Communist Party,
	The future of life faces the sun.

	The masses praised the movement, saying: "The secretary opened his mouth, the whole Party took action, poems are like seawater, and paintings cover the walls."

	From this collection, we can see that Wangren Township's poetry and painting movement closely coordinated with political movements and production. Although the content and themes are so rich and colorful, they all embody the principle of "politics in command." The political and ideological nature is very strong, and they can write and paint in time with the central work, so they cooperate with the Party's political education and promote production. Among the one hundred paintings selected, forty-eight praised this year's bumper harvest in industry and agriculture. One painting depicts a very tall granary, with a person standing on top. A field of starlight is half-way down the granary, and the poem reads:

	The whole country sings of a year of bumper harvest,
	The granary is so full it breaks the sky,
	Working people stand on top of the granary,
	Only seeing the stars and moon below.

	What rich imagination!

	In short, in this collection, every work shines with the talents and wisdom of the working people.

	This is an unusual "Selected Poetry and Painting Collection," created, compiled, and printed entirely by a people's commune. From here, we can see the dawn of a future cultural boom.

    不寻常的诗画选集
    安徽省阜阳县王人乡在乡党委领导下，不到一个月的时间内，全乡创作墙头诗十四万三千四百首，“技术上墙”画五百六十幅，诗画合一的墙头诗画二万一千三百四十幅。王人乡党委编选了一本“诗画选集”，就是从这二万多幅中精选一百幅，由公社的石印厂印刷的。
    从这本选集中，我们可以看到王人乡开展诗画运动的成绩是很大的。同时也可以看到我国劳动人民在党的领导下，不仅政治上翻了身，而且文化上也翻了身。劳动群众才是文化的真正创造者。他们有无限的智慧和创造力。
    这本选集中所选的，从乡党委书记起到普通农民、妇女、老太太的作品都有。七个乡党委书记全都带头写、画，第一书记陶叶华同志一夜曾写诗十一首，并亲自修改画稿。他写的一首“人心倾向共产党”的诗是：
    红旗飘展向东方，葵花开放向太阳，人心倾向共产党，生活前景向太阳。
    群众对这个运动歌颂是：“书记开了口，全党来动手，诗歌似海水，绘画满墙头。”
    从这本选集中可以看到，王人乡的诗画运动是密切配合了政治运动和生产的。内容题材虽然是那样的丰富多彩，但都体现了一条“政治挂帅”。政治思想性很强，能及时跟着中心工作连写带画，所以配合了党的政治教育，促进了生产。在选出的一百幅画中，歌颂今年工农业大丰收的有四十八幅。有一幅画画着一个很高的粮仓，上边站一人，粮仓半腰是一片星光，诗写道：
    全国歌唱丰收年，满仓粮食顶破天，劳动人民仓顶站，只见星月在下边。
    这是多么丰富的幻想呵！
    总之，在这本选集中，每一篇作品都闪烁着劳动人民的才能与智慧的光芒。
    这是一本不寻常的“诗画选集”，创作、编选、印刷完全由一个人民公社自己做，从这里便可以看到未来的文化大繁荣的曙光。
