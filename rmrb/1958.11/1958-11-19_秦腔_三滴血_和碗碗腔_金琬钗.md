Qinqiang "Three Drops of Blood" and Wanwanqiang "Golden Bracelet"
	Ouyang Yuqian

The Shaanxi Provincial Opera Troupe's performance in Beijing has been warmly welcomed. I watched the First Troupe's "Three Drops of Blood" and the Third Troupe's "Golden Bracelet," and I felt that both were performed very well. I enjoyed watching them thoroughly, and they also sparked some thoughts.

The First Troupe was originally the Shaanxi Yisu Society. In 1921, thirty-seven years ago, I was performing in Hankou, and they happened to be performing there as well. I often went to see their performances and had several gatherings with their playwrights and actors. At that time, famous Dan (female) roles like Liu Zhensou and Liu Dimin, and the famous clown Ma Pingmin, all passed away in their youth. The male role Liu Yuzhong has come this time, and I can still recognize him. After asking him, I learned that the playwright Mr. Fan Zidong has passed away, and Mr. Li Yuezhi is over eighty years old and still healthy. I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia. Some of the plays they performed at that time are still vivid in my memory, and I was once moved by them. I even adapted their "Han Baoying" and "Ruan Yuping" into Peking operas, which were performed by Zhou Xinfang, Gao Baishui, and myself.

From the beginning, the Shaanxi Yisu Society was not just for art's sake. As the name suggests, it had the ambition to change customs. Their plays mostly aimed to improve social customs, eliminate feudal superstitions, and promote patriotic ideas. However, under the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang, it did not receive the development it deserved and was even subjected to undue destruction. Before liberation, this troupe didn't know what to do and couldn't find the right path. It was only after liberation that it was reborn. After being separated from this troupe for more than thirty years, I saw them today in the people's capital, seeing that under the leadership of the Party, they have cultivated new forces, organized new teams, and made new developments in the performance of their repertoire. I couldn't help but feel sincerely happy.

"Three Drops of Blood" was originally an old repertoire, which has been reorganized into a very complete and excellent comedy. It satirizes a muddleheaded county magistrate, Jin Xinshu, who believes in the reliability of the "blood kinship test." He ran into snags three times in a row, separating a father and son who were actually related. He also separated a pair of unrelated siblings who wanted to marry, declaring them to be siblings from the same womb. Then, he even insisted that a son who was clearly his own was not, even falsely accusing his mother of having an affair. It's truly hard not to laugh. The plot of this play is very tortuous, a legendary tale of joys and sorrows, ending in reunion. The muddleheaded magistrate Jin Xinshu also received the punishment he deserved. Watching this kind of play is quite relaxing and enjoyable. This is a comedy, but it is treated seriously in terms of handling, performed as a straight drama, but the result is a comedic effect. For example, the county magistrate Jin Xinshu clearly did very ridiculous things, but he was always serious and complacent, with no comedic performance, yet he was the most laughable figure being satirized. I found it very interesting.

Wanwanqiang was originally a shadow puppet play. Before liberation, it was on the verge of extinction and has only been rescued in recent years. In 1956, it was first brought to the stage and performed by people. Because this opera genre is popular in Huazhou area in eastern Shaanxi, it was renamed "Hua Opera." This was my first time seeing it. I am completely an outsider to this opera genre. Like others, I only felt that the tunes were very pleasant to listen to, and the performances were sincere and moving.

"Golden Bracelet" is a traditional repertoire that has been circulating for a long time. The plot is unbelievably tortuous: It is said that Cui Hu of the Tang Dynasty had two younger sisters, Yanniang and Liniang. Yanniang, during a spring outing, fell in love with a young man named Lu Chong and deliberately left behind a golden bracelet. Unexpectedly, it was obtained by an evil monk who forced Yanniang to death. After Yanniang's death, she was helped by a fox fairy to marry Lu Chong and have a son. Fearing that the difference between humans and ghosts would arouse Lu Sheng's suspicion, she falsely claimed to be Liniang, thus causing many complicated disputes. Liniang also had a golden bracelet, which accidentally got caught in her brother Cui Hu's clothes. Cui Hu, during a spring outing, met a beauty and gave this bracelet to the village girl Tao Xiaochun. Therefore, the two golden bracelets became increasingly difficult to disentangle. The county magistrate was also punished for this. In the end, it was Yanniang's spirit who explained the origin of the case to conclude the matter. I heard that someone asked if this was a mythological drama. I think it is still a play pieced together from legends. The appearance of the fox fairy and the raising of a child by a ghost are also familiar tropes, which no longer arouse any superstition. In this play, they are used to express unchanging love between life and death. In feudal times, it was difficult for women to meet men, so those who fell in love at first sight were especially numerous. If they encountered many obstacles, they would fight to the death, which also had its social roots. This play particularly emphasizes the infatuation of women, while the depiction of men towards women is relatively indifferent. For example, Lu Chong towards Yanniang and Cui Hu towards Tao Xiaochun are not passionate enough, merely not unfaithful. In a male-centered society, there are infatuated women and unfaithful men everywhere. The Lu Chong and Cui Hu in this play are probably considered rare by the playwrights and directors, and I also agree. This play can be watched in one go, effortlessly and without burden, and can be used to recover from fatigue, which is a good effect.

I am very happy to have watched the above two plays by the Shaanxi Provincial Opera Troupe performing in Beijing. They have reorganized the traditional repertoire very well, and they also have many modern repertoires. I used to watch the Yisu Society perform several current affairs plays, which were all very complete. It can be said that Qinqiang has a tradition of performing modern life. I am especially happy to see that a group of young actors can sing and act, singing pleasantly and acting appropriately. They all possess the qualities of being actors. There are not many old actors in the First Troupe, and almost all the actors in the Second and Third Troupes are young actors, which shows that the young actors cultivated in recent years are of considerable quantity and attention has also been paid to quality. I am delighted that they have received strong support from the Party and the government. At the same time, it can be seen that the older generation of artists has put in a lot of effort for them. They are strong successors, and they still have a lot to learn. Artistic achievement cannot lack constant accumulation. With the great leap in production and the popularization of education, the broad masses' demands for art will inevitably be higher. This will make our actors unable to be content with the status quo at any time and will have to work hard. I think that under the leadership of the Party, the young actors of the Shaanxi Opera Troupes will be able to vigorously develop the artistic undertakings of various Northwest opera genres and better serve socialist construction.

    秦腔“三滴血”和碗碗腔“金琬钗”
    欧阳予倩
    陕西省戏曲赴京演出团在首都受到热烈的欢迎，我看了第一团的“三滴血”和第三团的“金琬钗”，觉得都演得很好，一气看完，获得艺术的享受，也引起一些感想。
    第一团原来是陕西易俗社。1921年，也就是去今三十七年前，我在汉口演戏，恰好他们也在那里演出。我经常去看戏，也和他们的剧作者、演员们聚谈过好几次。当时有名的旦角如刘箴俗、刘迪民，名丑马平民，都在青年时期就先后去世了。生角刘毓中这回来了，我还能认识他，问过了他才知道剧作家范紫东先生已故，李约之先生已经八十多岁，还健在，不禁兴起怀旧之感。当时他们所演的戏有些还历历在目，我曾经为之感动。并曾把他们编的“韩宝英”、“软玉屏”改编为京戏，由我和周信芳、高百岁两位演出过。
    陕西易俗社一开始就不是为艺术而艺术的，顾名思义是有移风易俗之志。他们的戏以改良风俗，破除封建迷信，宣传爱国思想的为多。但在国民党腐败统治之下，没有得到应有的发展，还受到了不应有的摧残。解放前这个剧团就弄得不知怎么办好，找不到正确的出路。解放以后又才得到了新生。我和这个剧团阔别三十多年，今天在人民的首都看见他们，看见他们在党的领导之下，培养出了新生的力量，组织了新的队伍，在剧目的演出方面有新的发展，不由得衷心感到喜悦。
    “三滴血”原是旧有的保留节目，经过整理，成了很完整、很好的喜剧。它讽刺一个糊涂县官晋信书相信“滴血认亲生”的办法可靠，一连碰了三次钉子，把人家亲生的父子拆散；又把一对要结婚的异姓姊弟，断为同胞姊弟，拆散了人家的婚姻；再又把分明是亲生的儿子断说不是亲生的，甚至诬指他的母亲有外遇，真令人忍笑不住。这个戏情节十分曲折，是传奇式的悲欢离合，以团圆终结。糊涂知县晋信书也受了应有的处分。看这种戏颇觉得轻松愉快。这是个喜剧，可是在处理方面却是严肃的，当一个正剧来演的，而所得的却是喜剧的效果。即如那个县官晋信书，分明做了很可笑的糊涂事，可是他一直是一本正经，心安理得，并没有什么滑稽的表演，可是他是一个被讽刺的最可笑的人物。我觉得很有意思。
    碗碗腔原来是皮影子戏。解放前已濒绝境，近年来才抢救回来。1956年第一次搬上舞台，由人来扮演，由于这个剧种流行陕西东部华州一带，改名“华剧”。我还是第一次看，对这个剧种来说我完全是外行，我和别人一样，只觉得腔调很好听，表演真切动人。
    “金琬钗”是一个流传很久的传统节目。情节曲折到不可思议：据说唐朝崔护有两个妹子，艳娘和丽娘。艳娘春游因爱一少年卢充，故意遗下金琬钗，不料为恶僧所得，逼死艳娘。艳娘死后得狐仙之助与卢充成婚生子，她为的怕人鬼殊途，引起卢生猜疑，假说自己是丽娘，因此引起许多错综复杂的纠纷。丽娘也有一支金琬钗，无意中夹在她哥哥崔护的衣服里面。崔护春游遇美，把这支钗赠给了村女桃小春。因此为了两支金琬钗弄得越来越扯不清。县官也为此受了处分。结果还是艳娘的魂来说明原由才了结一场公案。听说有人问这是不是神话剧，我以为还是由传说凑合而成的戏。狐仙现形，鬼养儿子，也是熟套，早已不会引起什么迷信，在这个戏里却是用来表现生死不变的爱情。封建时代的女子很难和男子见面，所以一见倾心的特别多。遇到好事多磨便拚一死，也是有其社会根源的。这个戏特别强调女子的痴恋，而写男子对女子则比较冷漠，如卢充对艳娘，崔护对桃小春都并不够热，只是不负心而已。在男性中心社会里，到处都是痴心女子负心汉，这个戏里的卢充、崔护大约在编者导者看来已经难得，我也以为对。这个戏一气看完，毫不费力，没有负担，可以用来恢复疲劳，这就是好的作用。
    我看了陕西省戏曲赴京演出团以上两个戏，很高兴。他们把传统节目整理得很好，他们也有不少现代剧目。我从前就看过易俗社演好几个时事戏，都很完整。秦腔表演现代生活可以说是有传统的。我尤其高兴的是看见一班青年演员个个能唱能演，唱得悦耳，演得也妥当，他们都具备了当演员的素质。一团老一辈的演员已经不多，二团、三团几乎全部都是青年演员，可见近几年来培养出来的青年演员是有相当的数量，也注意到质量。欣幸他们得到党和政府的大力支持，同时也可以看得出来前辈艺人为他们下了不少功夫。他们是有力的接班人，他们还有很多东西要学，艺术的成就不能缺少经常不断的积累。生产大跃进，教育大普及，广大群众对艺术的要求必然更高，这将使得我们的演员随时随刻不能安于现状，而不得不勤修苦练。我想陕西戏曲各团的青年演员，在党的领导之下，必能把西北各剧种的艺术事业努力向前发展，更好地为社会主义建设服务。
