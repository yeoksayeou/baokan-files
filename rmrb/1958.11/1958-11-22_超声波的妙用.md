Believe it or not, there is a sound that cannot be heard, and it is very useful.

Sounds that are too low, such as gently waving a fan, cannot be detected by the human ear, which is easy to understand. It seems that in order for people to hear, the sound should be raised, but if the sound is higher than a certain range, it also cannot be heard.

The highness or lowness of a sound is actually the number of vibrations of a sound wave in a unit of time, which is the so-called frequency. The frequency of sound that normal people can hear is about 20 to 20,000 times per second. Those exceeding 20,000 times cannot be heard by people, and this is ultrasound.

Ultrasound has strange properties and has great uses in industry, agriculture, medicine and health, navigation, and scientific research.

Sound waves will be reflected when they encounter obstacles. The echo that people usually hear is the result of reflection. The sound waves emitted by ordinary people must encounter large obstacles to be reflected, otherwise they may bypass the object. Ultrasound is different. Even objects as small as a few centimeters can also be reflected. Based on this characteristic, ultrasonic depth sounders, ultrasonic flaw detectors, and ultrasonic diagnosis of tumors can be made.

An ultrasonic depth sounder emits ultrasonic waves to the seabed, and reflection can be used to know the depth of the sea and the location of obstacles very accurately. Relying on it, ships will not be in danger of running aground even when sailing in the dark or in heavy fog.

To know whether there are tiny defects inside mechanical parts, you can use the method of emitting ultrasound to detect flaws. If there are defects (such as air bubbles) inside the machine parts, the ultrasound will be scattered and will not be passed through like other normal parts. The accuracy of ultrasonic flaw detection is very high, truly discerning the finest detail.

Because tumors and normal tissues are different, the reflection of ultrasound is also different, so doctors can use ultrasound to diagnose tumors.

Another characteristic of ultrasound is its powerful vibration and the effect of crushing materials. In the manufacture of certain chemical products, several mutually insoluble substances—such as oil and water—often need to be mixed evenly. This is indeed a difficult task, but ultrasound can crush the oil droplets and distribute them evenly in the water.

Using ultrasound, holes can also be drilled in glass. Apply a mixture of boron carbide and water to the glass, and then emit ultrasound on it. A very smooth hole will be produced in a few minutes, and the entire piece of glass will remain intact.

Vacuum tubes are an indispensable object in cutting-edge science and technology. The manufacture of vacuum tubes must go through a high degree of cleaning procedure, and ordinary washing methods are difficult to achieve this "spotless" requirement. Ultrasound can complete this procedure. Similarly, our country also uses ultrasound in the dyeing industry, which can make the dye more evenly distributed on the fibers, and the dyeing effect is very good.

Ultrasound can also change the properties of substances. The most practical significance of this is that the seeds of certain crops (such as peas) will grow rapidly after being irradiated with ultrasound.

The research on ultrasound is still an emerging science, and its uses are far more than those mentioned above. In the all-round great leap forward, our country has included ultrasound in the research plan, so that it can serve production, science and human health more and better. As for obtaining ultrasound by artificial methods, it is not difficult. Just use a thin quartz plate, attach two iron plates up and down, and then pass alternating current with a frequency of hundreds of thousands of times per second, and the quartz plate will vibrate rapidly, generating ultrasound.

    超声波的妙用
    王震元
    信不信由你，有一种声音是听不见的，而且它的用处非常大。
    过低的声音，比如说轻轻地挥动扇子，人的耳朵就察觉不到，这是容易理解的。看来为了要让人听见，应当把声音提高些，但是声音高过一定范围以后，同样也不能被人听见了。
    声音的高或低，实际上就是在单位时间内声波振动次数多还是少，这就是所谓的频率。正常人能听到的声音，频率大约在每秒二十次至两万次之间，超过两万次的，人们也听不见，这就是超声波。
    超声波有奇异的性质，在工业、农业、医药卫生、航海和科学研究等方面都有巨大的用途。
    声波碰到了障碍物就会反射回来，人们平常所听到的回声就是反射的结果。普通人所发出的声波，必须碰到大的障碍物才能反射，否则它就可能绕物而过。超声波则不同，即使是几厘米小的物体，同样也能反射。根据这个特点，可以作成超声波测深器、超声波探伤器和利用超声波诊断肿瘤等。
    超声波测深器向海底发射超声波，利用反射可以非常精确地知道海的深度和障碍物在什么地方。船只依靠了它，即使在黑夜或大雾里航行也不会有触礁的危险。
    要想知道机械的零件内部是否有微小的缺陷，可以用发射超声波的办法来探伤。如果机件内部有缺陷（例如气泡），超声波就会散射，不像其他正常部分那样被通过。超声波探伤的精确度非常高，真是明察秋毫之末。
    由于肿瘤和正常组织不同，对超声波的反射情况也就有所差别，所以医生可以用超声波来诊断肿瘤。
    超声波的另一特点是它的强大的振动和粉碎物质的作用。在某些化学药品的制造上，往往需要几种互不溶解的物质——比如油和水均匀地混合起来。这的确是一件难事，但是超声波可将油滴打得粉碎，使它均匀地分布在水内。
    利用超声波，还可以在玻璃上钻孔。涂一些碳化硼和水的混合物在玻璃上，然后向上面发射超声波，几分钟后就产生了非常光滑的孔，而整块玻璃仍是完好无缺。
    真空管是尖端科学技术中一个不可缺少的物件，制造真空管。必须要经过高度的洗净手续，而普通的洗涤法是很难达到这个“一尘不染”的要求的。超声波却能完成这一道手续。同样，我国在染色工业上也采用了超声波，它能使染料更均匀地分布在纤维上，染色的效果非常好。
    超声波还会改变物质的性质，其中最有实际意义的是某些农作物（如豌豆）的种子经过超声波照射后会迅速地成长起来。
    对超声波的研究，还是一门新兴的科学，它的用途远不止上面谈的那些。在全面跃进中，我国已经把超声波列入了研究的计划，要让它更多、更好地为生产、科学和人类的健康服务。至于用人为的方法来取得超声波并不困难。只要用一块薄的石英片，上下镶两块铁片，然后通以频率为每秒几十万次的变流电，石英片就会迅速地振动起来，产生了超声波。
