Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 23rd. Old Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor Liu Dafu of Wuhan Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital performed the first "Willow Branch Bone Setting Method" surgery on patient Liu Lixiu. After five months of treatment and recuperation, the patient, whose leg bone was crushed, has completely eliminated pain in his leg, can walk with a cane, and will soon be able to return to his work post.

After this legacy of traditional Chinese medicine was discovered and applied to the human body, major hospitals in Wuhan also began to study his experience. So far, according to statistics from six hospitals, forty-nine patients have undergone willow branch bone setting surgery. Cases include new fractures and old fractures, adults and children. The operations were performed not only on the long bones of the limbs but also on the fingers, toes, joints, and spine. Most patients achieved first-stage healing, and limb function is gradually recovering.

The willow branch bone-setting method is a legacy of traditional Chinese medicine that had been lost for more than twenty years. The basic feature of this treatment is to place a peeled willow branch on the bone fracture, using it to replace the bone fragments taken from animals. The willow branch eventually turns into bone. According to X-ray examination by Wuhan Medical College, it has also been proven that the original wood completely transformed into bone.

    中医用柳枝接骨效果好
    新华社武汉23日电　武汉中医院老中医刘达夫用“柳枝接骨法”第一个给病人刘礼修动了手术，经过五个月的治疗和休养，这个腿骨被压碎的病人，腿部已经完全没有了痛疼，能撑棍走路，不久就可以重新回到劳动岗位上去。
    这项祖国医学遗产被发掘并运用到人体以后，武汉各大医院也纷纷学习和研究他的经验，到现在为止，据六个医院的统计，已经给四十九个病人做了柳枝接骨手术。病例中有新的骨折，也有陈旧的骨折，有大人，也有小孩，做的部位除四肢长骨外，在手指、足指、关节、脊椎等部位也都做了这个手术。大部分病人都是第一期愈合，肢体功能在逐步恢复。
    柳枝接骨法是已经失传二十多年的祖国医学遗产。这种医疗的基本特征，就是把剥皮的柳树棒安在骨碎位置，用以代替从动物体中取出的碎骨部分。柳枝到后来就变成了骨头。据武汉医学院用X光拍片检验，也证明原来的木质完全变成了骨质。
