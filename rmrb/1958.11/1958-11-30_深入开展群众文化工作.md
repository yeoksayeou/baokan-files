Deeply Develop Mass Cultural Work
People's Daily Commentator

    Simultaneous with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, hundreds of millions of working people, in a mighty and powerful force, are marching towards the fortress of culture and art, rapidly forming a new cultural revolution movement. This movement is prominently manifested in the great popularization of culture, the great flourishing of creation, and the great development of organization. Hundreds of millions of working people have shed the label of illiteracy, and immediately after shedding the label of illiteracy, they picked up their pens to compose poetry and wielded brushes to paint. By the end of October, the number of mass creations nationwide had reached more than 880 million. In some places, poetry and painting are everywhere in every village and commune, and often there is singing in the midst of tense labor. People sing the happy present of socialist society and the even happier prospect of communism, sing the communist style of the working people, thereby further promoting production and construction. The close integration of cultural work with productive labor has opened up a broad road for the realization of the great popularization of culture.

    The broad masses of working people are carrying out a vigorous cultural revolution and have already achieved initial and significant results. At present, the movement is spreading and deepening further. How to continue to vigorously develop and how to consolidate and improve are important issues at present.

    While the cultural revolution is entering its climax, we see that the development of the movement is uneven, with large disparities between regions. Some regions have formed a nationwide cultural movement, creating a vigorous situation, while in other regions the masses have not been fully mobilized and remain cold and deserted. In regions where the movement has already spread, the development of various activity projects is also uneven. Except for poetry activities, which have been carried out more universally throughout the country, other projects are relatively poor, and some differ greatly. The cultural revolution is a great cultural emancipation movement of 600 million people, and it is a common need of the broad masses. The masses demand to become the masters of culture and art and to comprehensively master culture and art. No region should be outside the cultural revolution, but should strengthen leadership, vigorously mobilize the masses, and catch up to eliminate the blank spots in the mass cultural revolution movement; regions that have already achieved victory in a single activity should also add more effort, go further, and strive for the all-round flowering of cultural and artistic activities. We must work together to thoroughly realize the great popularization of culture nationwide.

    In regions where the movement has already spread, in order for the movement to continue to develop, we should attach importance to correctly solving the problem of improvement on the basis of popularization. Specifically, we must comprehensively solve the problem of professional guidance. On the issue of professional guidance, we must fully follow the mass line. First, the masses should exchange experiences, conduct practical observation, and conduct in-depth research; second, professionals and amateurs should be combined, and experts and the masses should be combined. Use these two methods to achieve the goal of mutual help and common improvement. In implementing guidance, we should actively promote the diversity of subjects and forms of mass creation. "Write what you do" is the main characteristic of mass literary and artistic creation, and it is also an important reason why the mass literary and artistic movement can be carried out. It should continue to be promoted. However, the life of the people is rich and colorful, and its actual situation is often based on a central task, which drives everything and produces a series of changes. As a weapon of ideological education, literature and art, in addition to reflecting people's labor and production, should further reflect people's thoughts and feelings, new spiritual outlook, and new social relations, in order to comprehensively and profoundly reflect people's life and spiritual world, open up a broader road for mass literary and artistic creation, and enable mass creation to achieve greater development.

    Guiding mass literary and artistic creation towards diversification should be gradually guided forward according to the actual possibilities of mass acceptance, consolidate their achievements, and inspire their thoughts. Do not simply put forward rigid requirements that make them daunted.

    The people's needs for cultural and artistic life are diverse, and their needs should be met in many ways. At the same time, they have diverse artistic talents, and their talents should be fully developed. The cultural and artistic heritage of our motherland has always been rich and colorful. At present, we are in a great era of one day equaling twenty years, and the content of life is unusually rich and magnificent, and it also needs diverse art forms to reflect this great era. The current mass creation movement has begun to develop in many directions, and many artistic forms are gradually being adopted. We should see this situation and correctly guide the movement forward.

    The methods of improvement should also be diverse. Promoting excellent works of mass creation, holding exhibitions, performances, conducting various competitions, running training classes, professional cultural workers giving guidance to the masses, etc., are all very good methods. We should promptly collect the experience of the masses and persist in it. Today, workers, peasants, and soldiers are gradually mastering culture, and their appreciation and discernment are also gradually improving. They can comment on works based on their own life experience, class consciousness, and understanding of cultural and artistic activities. We should organize the masses to participate in literary and artistic theory criticism work, and gradually form a mass literary and artistic theory criticism team. This will not only guide the movement, but also open up a new path for the construction of literary and artistic theory.

    The great popularization of mass culture is an earth-shaking movement and is the main content of building a new culture of socialism and communism for the nation. Only under the correct leadership of the Party, serving politics, and combining with production can the great popularization of culture be realized. We must use the spirit of continuous revolution to improve on the basis of popularization, and popularize under the guidance of improvement, so that mass cultural work can develop rapidly, well, and economically, so that working people can have a rich and colorful cultural life.

    深入开展群众文化工作
    本报评论员
    在工农业生产大跃进的同时，几亿劳动人民浩浩荡荡，向文化艺术的堡垒进军，迅速形成了一个新的文化革命运动。这个运动突出的表现为文化大普及，创作大繁荣，组织大发展。亿万劳动人民摘掉了文盲的帽子，并且在刚刚摘掉文盲帽子以后，立即提笔赋诗，挥毫作画。到10月底为止，全国群众创作已达八亿八千多万件。有些地方，村村社社已经处处诗画，在紧张的劳动当中，常常是一片歌声。人们歌唱着社会主义社会的幸福的今天和更为幸福的共产主义的远景，歌唱着劳动人民的共产主义风格，从而更推进了生产和建设。文化工作与生产劳动紧紧结合，就为实现文化大普及开辟了广阔的道路。
    广大劳动人民，进行着轰轰烈烈的文化革命，已经初步得到巨大的成果。目前运动正在更加铺开，更加深入。如何继续大力发展和如何巩固提高，是当前的重要课题。
    在文化革命进入高潮的同时，我们看到，运动的发展是不平衡的，地区之间悬殊很大，有的地区已形成全民的文化运动，造成轰轰烈烈的局面，也有的地区群众还未充分发动起来，依然冷冷清清。在运动已经铺开的地区，各种活动项目的开展也是不平衡的，除诗歌活动在全国范围内开展得比较普遍外，其他项目就比较差了，有的相差很大。文化革命是六亿人民的伟大的文化翻身运动，是广大人民的共同需要。群众要求成为文化艺术的主人，全面地掌握文化艺术。任何地区都不应处在文化革命之外，而要加强领导，大力发动群众，迎头赶上去，消灭群众文化革命运动的空白点；已在单项活动上取得胜利的地区，也要再加把油，百尺竿头，更进一步，争取文化艺术活动全面开花。我们要为在全国范围内彻底实现文化大普及而共同努力。
    在运动已经铺开的地区，要使运动继续发展，就应当重视在普及的基础上正确解决提高的问题。具体地说，要全面地解决业务辅导问题。在业务辅导问题上，要充分地走群众路线，首先是群众交流经验，实际观摩，深入研究；其次要专业与业余相结合，专家与群众相结合。运用这两种方法，达到互相帮助共同提高的目的。在实行辅导中，应该积极提倡群众创作的题材和形式上的多样性。“做什么，写什么”，正是群众文艺创作的主要特点，也是群众文艺运动能够开展的一个重要的原因，应该继续发扬。但是，人民的生活是丰富多采的，它的实际状况常常是以一件中心工作为纲，带动一切，随之就产生了一系列的变化。作为思想教育的武器的文学艺术，除了反映人的劳动生产之外，要进一步地反映人们的思想感情、新的精神面貌、新的社会关系，以便全面地深刻地反映人们的生活面貌和精神世界，为群众文艺创作打开更广阔的道路，使群众创作得到更大的发展。
    引导群众文艺创作向多样化的方向发展，要根据群众实际接受的可能，逐步向前引导，要巩固他们的成绩，启发他们的思想，不要简单的硬性的提出要求，使他们望而却步。
    人民对文艺生活的需要是多种多样的，应当多方面的满足他们的需要，同时他们又有多方面的艺术才能，应当充分地发展他们的才能。我们祖国的文化艺术遗产本来就是丰富多彩的，目前我们处在一天等于二十年的伟大时代里，生活的内容异常丰富、异常壮丽，也需要多种多样的艺术形式来反映这个伟大的时代。目前的群众创作运动开始向多方面发展，许许多多的艺术形式逐渐被采用。我们应该看到这种形势，正确地指导运动前进。
    在提高的方法上，也应该多种多样。推广群众创作的优秀作品、举办展览、会演、进行各种评比竞赛、大搞训练班、专业文化工作者对群众辅导，等等，都是很好的方法。我们应当及时地把群众的经验集中上来，再坚持下去。如今工农兵逐步地掌握了文化，欣赏力与鉴别力也逐步提高，他们能够根据自己的生活实践、阶级觉悟、对文化艺术活动的体会来评论作品。我们应当组织群众参与文艺理论批评工作，逐步形成群众文艺理论批评的队伍，这样不仅可以指导运动，同时也为文艺理论的建设工作开辟一条崭新的途径。
    群众文化大普及是一个天翻地复的运动，是建设社会主义、共产主义的民族的新文化的主要内容。只有在党的正确领导下，为政治服务，同生产结合，才能实现文化大普及。我们要以不断革命的精神，在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及，使群众文化工作多快好省地向前发展，让劳动人民都能有丰富多彩的文化生活。
