Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 7th: Since the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party used treacherous means to extend the Diet's extraordinary session, completely exposing its plot to revive the police state, the Japanese people's struggle to smash the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment," oppose the revival of the police state, and defend democracy has intensified.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the All-Japan Trade Union Congress, the National Congress of Industrial Organizations, and other trade unions held meetings on the 6th, respectively, and decided to strengthen the struggle to smash the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment."

Japanese newspapers have successively published editorials these days, attacking the Liberal Democratic Party's despicable behavior of using tricks to extend the Diet session and condemning the Kishi Nobusuke group for violating democracy.

    The "Mainichi Shimbun" today demanded that the Liberal Democratic Party thoroughly reflect on its actions and pointed out that there is no other way out except to cancel the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment."

    The "Asahi Shimbun" today published opinions from prominent figures from all walks of life in Japan regarding the Diet session being stalled due to the Kishi Nobusuke group forcibly and illegally passing a resolution to extend the Diet session. Tadashi Yoshimura, professor at Waseda University, Rintaro Fukuhara, professor at the University of Education, critics Yoshimi Usui, Ayako Ishigaki, and Mao Hara, chairman of the Coal Miners' Union, unanimously condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party's actions as illegal acts that undermine parliamentary politics and democracy. Many people also demanded the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

    The "Hokkaido Shimbun" commented on the 5th that the root cause of the current political turmoil lies in the dangerousness of the content of the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" and the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's anti-democratic and abuse of power attitude. The newspaper pointed out that the urgent task for the Japanese people at present is how to safeguard democracy, which is facing a crisis, from the oppression of power politics.

As the voices of opposition from the Japanese people and public opinion have risen, the Liberal Democratic Party has begun to waver. Former Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi published an article in the "Yomiuri Shimbun" morning edition on the 6th, criticizing the Kishi Nobusuke government's politics. Ishibashi pointed out that all politicians should study why so many groups and people are opposed to the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" and examine whether there are shortcomings in the current politics. This is the responsibility of politicians.

According to a report in the "Asahi Shimbun" today, Takeo Miki, Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency of the Kishi Nobusuke government, has already submitted his opinion to Kishi Nobusuke on the 6th, requesting him to invalidate the resolution to extend the Diet session.

    The "Mainichi Shimbun" pointed out today that signs of a major wavering have appeared in the Liberal Democratic Party, and the future of the political situation presents unpredictable anxiety.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 7th: The National Conference Against the Bad Revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" held a national rally in Tokyo today, protesting against the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's use of tricks to extend the Diet's extraordinary session, and passed a resolution declaring the Diet's resolution invalid.

More than 800 representatives from 152 Japanese workers', farmers', youth, women's, and cultural groups attended the rally. The resolution passed by the representatives strongly condemned the Liberal Democratic Party for using despicable means to extend the Diet session, undermine parliamentary politics, and trample on democracy; therefore, the representatives declared that they could not recognize this illegal resolution.

The resolution firmly stated that in order to smash the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" and maintain parliamentary politics, they will call on all the Japanese people and public opinion to fight to the end.

Chairman of the Socialist Party Mosaburo Suzuki, Vice Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan Akira Imamura, and representatives from the All-Japan Trade Union Congress, the National Congress of Industrial Organizations, neutral trade unions, the National Federation of Farmers' Associations, the Women's Association for the Protection of National Human Rights, the Japan Congress of Journalists, and religious groups spoke at the meeting, unanimously condemning the illegal actions of the Kishi Nobusuke government. They pointed out that the outrage of illegally extending the Diet session is the first step in the political bankruptcy of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. They called on the Japanese people to strengthen unity, launch a struggle of strength, promote the dissolution of the Diet, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, and prevent the conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" aimed at moving toward the road of war.

As of today, 331 groups have participated in the National Conference Against the Bad Revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

The Federation for the Defense of the Constitution also issued a statement on the 6th, condemning the Liberal Democratic Party's despicable act of illegally extending the Diet session. The statement announced that if the Liberal Democratic Party does not recognize the invalidity of the resolution to extend the Diet session passed by trickery and unilaterally continues to hold Diet sessions, then all laws passed by the Diet after November 8 will be invalid and cannot bind the Japanese people.

The Japan Society of World Literature also issued a statement on the 6th, opposing the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment." The Society of World Literature believes that "the amendment will infringe upon the basic human rights of the people and will threaten freedom of research and speech."

    由于日本人民和舆论的反对声浪日益高涨，自由民主党内部开始动摇起来。前任首相石桥湛山在6日的“读卖新闻”早刊上发表文章批评岸信介政府的政治。石桥指出，凡是政治家都应该研究为什么有这样多的团体和人民在反对“警察官职务执行法修正案”，检讨目前的政治有无缺点，这是政治家应有的责任。
