    De Gaulle Faces France's Financial and Economic Crisis
    Wen Xin
    De Gaulle stole the majority of votes in the referendum on September 28, passing the so-called "Fifth Republic Constitution" in an attempt to strengthen the rule of French monopoly capital. However, this cannot solve the difficulties faced by the French ruling group. The De Gaulle regime not only faces the powerful wave of colonial people demanding independence and the domestic people's struggle for peace and democracy, but also faces an increasingly serious financial and economic crisis.

        A Ruined Mess
    Long-term colonial wars and arms expansion have kept France in a severe financial crisis. From 1947 to 1954, due to the Indochina War and arms expansion, France's military expenditure reached an astonishing figure of 7.4 trillion francs. Although the end of the Indochina War in 1955 gave French finances a year of respite, the expansion of the Algerian War in 1956 made the situation worse again. In 1958 alone, the Algerian war expenditure is estimated to be over one trillion francs, which is undoubtedly an unbearable burden for the French finances facing an impasse.
    For eleven years, the heavy burden of military expenditure has brought huge deficits to France's annual budgets. For example, the budget deficit in 1957 was 1,041 billion francs. This year it will not decrease. In the past, France's fiscal deficit was mainly made up by "US aid," inflation, increased taxes, and issuing public bonds. However, "US aid" is decreasing year by year. During the Indochina War, the French government could receive an average of 700 million US dollars in aid from the United States every year, but in 1957 it only received 125 million US dollars. At the beginning of this year, the Gaillard government nominally received a loan of 655,525,000 US dollars. In reality, 131,125,000 US dollars of this loan came from the International Monetary Fund, and this was only part of the fees France paid as a member of this organization; secondly, this loan also included a temporary postponement of 186 million US dollars of wartime loans due, and 86 million US dollars of surplus cotton and military supplies. Therefore, the "real benefits" France received from this loan are very limited. Even so, France agreed to give the United States many "preferential treatments" for this loan. From this, it can be seen that unless France is determined to pay a heavy price, the road of attempting to rely on "US aid" to solve its financial difficulties is becoming increasingly unfeasible.
    Another magic weapon for the French government to make up for the deficit is inflation. However, this magic weapon has now turned into a serious threat to the financial crisis. From March 31, 1947, to January 5, 1956, the amount of French paper money in circulation increased from 751 billion francs to 2,836 billion francs; in 1957, the French government had the Bank of France advance another 550 billion francs. By the end of 1957, the amount of French paper money issued had increased to 3,268 billion francs.
    Inflation has resulted in repeated devaluations of the franc and continuous price increases. In the past eleven years, the franc has been devalued five times, from 34.96 francs to one US dollar in 1938, to 420 francs to one US dollar in 1957. That is to say, foreign goods that used to require one franc to import now require twelve francs.
    The phenomenon of rising prices in France has been most significant in the past two years. In 1957, wholesale prices rose by 14%, and retail prices rose by 15%. Compared with before the war, the current retail prices in France are 30.5 times those of 1938, and wholesale prices are 26 times.
    After the war, in order to solve its financial difficulties, successive French governments tried every possible means to squeeze the people and increase their tax burden. For example, direct tax and business tax in 1947 only increased four times compared with 1938, but by 1955 it had increased fifty-four times. In the two years of 1956 and 1957 alone, the additional tax burden reached 685 billion francs.
    The national debt has also increased rapidly. By the first half of 1958, the domestic debt had reached 6,187.4 billion francs, and the foreign debt had reached 1,017.5 billion francs. France is now one of the most indebted countries in the world.
    The trade deficit and the international payment crisis are also important factors contributing to the increasing severity of France's financial and economic crisis. After the war, from 1946 to 1953, France's international payments were always in deficit. There was a slight improvement in 1954 and 1955, but after 1956, the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. In 1956, the deficit reached 835 million US dollars, and by the end of 1957, it had increased to 1.5 billion US dollars. Gold and foreign exchange reserves were almost exhausted. The crisis in international balance of payments is mainly the result of the deterioration of foreign trade. In the past two years, the trade deficit has been even more serious, with exports only making up for 71% to 73% of imports. The deficit in 1957 reached 492.5 billion francs. On the one hand, this is because France is too dependent on foreign power and raw materials in the development of industry. On the other hand, the war economy has also greatly increased the trade deficit. In addition, the competition between the United States and West Germany and the embargo policy implemented by successive French governments that succumbed to the United States have also greatly deepened this crisis.
    This is the ruined mess of France's financial and economic situation that is placed before De Gaulle.

      Useless methods
    De Gaulle's choice of Independent Party leader Pinay as Minister of Finance has two reasons: first, because Pinay made great efforts in his struggle to seize power, and second, to use Pinay's "valuable experience" in 1952 to step up the exploitation of the working people to maintain the war economy and alleviate the increasingly serious financial crisis.
    In the past five months, the methods taken by Pinay mainly include the following aspects: First, he issued a 54-year gold bond with an annual interest rate of 3.5%. The result of the issuance was the recovery of more than 320 billion francs (of which 293 billion was cash and 30 billion was the return of interest on old public bonds) and 150 tons of gold, equivalent to 175 million to 200 million US dollars. The French authorities desperately boasted about the success of the issuance of public bonds, boasting that gold and foreign exchange reserves had been greatly improved. But what is the actual situation? We might as well peel it open and take a look: (1) The cash recovered from this public bond is not as much as that recovered from the 1956 public bond. In 1956, 320 billion francs returned to the national treasury. (2) The gold recovered this time only accounts for 1.6% of the total amount of gold scattered in the hands of holders. (3) The amount of cash recovered from this public bond cannot keep up with the increase in paper money issuance. For example, from October 1956 to July 1958, the amount of paper money issued increased from 3,242 billion to 3,570 billion, that is to say, in nearly two years, the amount of paper money in circulation increased by more than 328 billion francs. (4) It is estimated that the amount of money recovered from this public bond can only last until the end of this year, even under the current financial situation. Therefore, this public bond only plays a temporary emergency role and is not a great way to solve France's financial difficulties.
    In addition to issuing new public bonds, the De Gaulle government also passed measures to increase taxes and freeze wages to shift the financial burden onto the working people. At the end of July this year, shortly after issuing the public bonds, the De Gaulle government decided to increase taxes by 50 billion francs. This tax increase includes exceptional taxes levied on companies, civic taxes levied on residences, consumption taxes, and the cancellation of several tax exemption decisions. At the same time, De Gaulle froze wages under the pretext of "appealing to French workers, employees, and farmers to sacrifice their own interests and maintain the stability of the franc." But at the same time that wages were frozen, prices (especially the prices of staple foods) continued to rise.
    In addition, the De Gaulle government also adopted a policy of restricting imports and expanding exports. In terms of restricting imports, in mid-July, the De Gaulle government announced that French imports would still maintain the level stipulated in the second half of 1956, and would not restore the level relaxed in June 1957. At the same time, active measures were taken to encourage exports: letting some industrial sectors undertake the task of exporting some products; and reducing export controls.
    These financial and economic measures taken by De Gaulle after taking office, on the surface, have somewhat improved France's gold and foreign exchange reserves, and the foreign trade situation has also improved somewhat. August was the first time in four years that France had a surplus in international payments. However, this temporary "improvement" cannot be maintained for long. Due to the continued Algerian War, France's financial difficulties will deepen. According to the "Politics and Economics" monthly magazine in September this year, the Algerian military expenditure, which was originally budgeted at 880 billion francs at the beginning of this year, has already exceeded 120 billion to 130 billion francs, thereby reaching a figure exceeding one trillion francs. This will greatly increase the budget deficit. Pinay himself has revealed that the deficit this year will reach about one trillion. This greatly exceeds the originally estimated level of 600 billion francs. In addition, the trade deficit is still a big problem. As of August this year, France's trade deficit has reached 282.22 billion francs.

      On the verge of crisis
    Due to the increasingly mature conditions for the capitalist world economic crisis and the factors that have stimulated French production in recent years are gradually losing their effect, France has begun to face the threat of an economic crisis of overproduction. If the "prosperity" of the French economy and the financial crisis, two contradictory phenomena, still existed at the same time in the previous period, then at present, while the financial crisis is still threatening France, production has also begun to decline. Even De Gaulle himself had to announce in a radio speech on August 1 that France may have to face the threat of economic recession.
    The signs of a crisis that have already appeared in the French economy are as follows:
    1. Slowdown and decline in production growth: Although the entire French production index is still growing, the speed is clearly slowing down. Last year, the growth rate of French industry was 10%, but in the first half of this year, French industrial production only increased by 8.5% compared with the same period last year. According to recent trends, it is expected that French industry in the second half of this year will be lower than the level of the same period last year. The downward trend is particularly significant in some sectors. For example, in the first half of 1958, compared with the same period last year, the situation of residential construction decreased by 12% due to a 15% reduction in government funding. The growth rate in the textile, hardware, equipment, cement, and electrical products industries has also declined significantly.
    2. Reduction in orders. The situation of canceling orders in some departments is very serious. The most prominent are the aviation industry, shipbuilding industry, metallurgy industry, and textile industry. The aviation industry has not received new orders since the end of last year. According to the Bank of France report in May, the metallurgy industry only has three months of work. This is the lowest order volume in this industry for many years. The orders recently canceled by the shipbuilding industry are equivalent to one year's workload of four or five large shipbuilding companies. This situation is closely related to the crisis in the world shipping industry. The reduction in orders in the textile sector has also significantly affected the production field, and the production in the northern provinces has clearly stagnated.
    3. Insufficient enterprise operation and relative surplus of labor. At present, the phenomenon of dismissing workers and shortening working hours has spread throughout France. For example, the textile industry, the household goods sector in the metal industry, the electrical appliance sector, bicycle and motorcycle factories, the shipbuilding industry, and the aviation industry have all dismissed thousands of workers. Working hours are also being reduced, and some factories have reduced from 50 hours a week to 40 hours. This affects workers' wage income. This situation clearly shows that although more than 500,000 laborers have been sent to Algeria to fight, unemployment is still threatening the French working people day by day.
    4. Decline in sales and increase in inventory. The most inventory is coal. As of June this year, coal inventories have almost doubled compared with the same period last year. In the textile and household goods sectors, sales in the first half of the year also fell very sharply.
    It can be seen from this that the stimulating effect of the Algerian War on French production is gradually losing, and the financial difficulties caused by the war are increasingly affecting the production field. For example, the Gaillard government had to cut imports in order to increase military expenditure, and the French cotton spinning industry once faced a crisis due to the lack of raw cotton. In addition, while the state reduces investment, the growth rate of private investment has decreased. For example, the estimated investment growth in 1958 will not exceed 13%, while it was 18% in 1957 and 23% in 1956. At the same time, the continuous impoverishment of the working people directly affects France's domestic trade. According to the bourgeois "Echo," the volume of domestic trade at the end of July 1958 has decreased by 15% compared with the same period last year.
    The development of the French economic crisis is an integral part of the development of the capitalist world economic crisis. The French ruling class's attempt to strengthen its control and exploitation of its own people and the colonial people through De Gaulle's personal dictatorship to alleviate its crisis is definitely impossible. Facts have proved that the series of policies adopted by De Gaulle after taking office towards the country and the colonies will not only fail to alleviate but will instead deepen the financial and economic crisis it faces.

    戴高乐面临的法国财政经济危机
    文欣
    戴高乐在9月28日公民投票中窃取了多数票，通过了所谓“第五共和国宪法”，企图借以加强法国垄断资本的统治。但是这并不能解决法国统治集团所面临的困难。戴高乐政权不仅面对着殖民地人民要求独立的强大浪潮和国内人民要求和平和民主的斗争，并且还面对着日益严重的财政和经济危机。
        一付破烂摊子
    长期的殖民战争和扩军备战使法国一直处于严重的财政危机中。从1947年到1954年，由于印度支那战争和扩军备战，法国的军费，曾达七万四千亿法郎的惊人数字。尽管1955年印度支那战争停止，曾使法国财政得到了一年的喘息机会，但是1956年阿尔及利亚战争的扩大，使情况又趋恶化。1958年仅阿尔及利亚战费预计就在一万亿法郎以上，这对于面临绝境的法国财政，无疑是一项沉重得难以支持的负担。
    十一年来，沉重的军费负担给法国历年预算带来巨大赤字。例如，1957年预算赤字是一万零四百一十亿法郎。今年也不会减少。法国的财政赤字过去主要是靠“美援”、通货膨胀、增加税收和发行公债等办法来弥补的。但是“美援”是在一年年减少。在印度支那战争期间，法国政府平均每年可以从美国得到七亿美元的援助，但是1957年却只获得一亿二千五百万美元。今年年初盖伊阿政府名义上得到了六亿五千五百二十五万美元的贷款，实际上，这笔贷款中，有一亿三千一百二十五万美元是来自国际货币基金，而这只是法国作为这个组织的一个成员所缴纳的费用的一部分；其次这笔贷款中还包括暂时延期支付的一亿八千六百万美元的到期战时贷款、八千六百万美元的剩余棉花和军事物资的供应。所以法国从这笔贷款中所得到的“实惠”是十分有限的。即使这样，法国还为这笔贷款答应了给美国许多“优惠”。由此可见，法国除非决心付出重大的代价，否则企图依靠“美援”来解决它的财政困难的道路是越来越行不通了。
    法国政府另一个弥补赤字的法宝是通货膨胀。但是这个法宝目前已反过来成为财政危机的严重威胁。从1947年3月31日到1956年1月5日，法国纸币流通量从七千五百一十亿法郎增加到二万八千三百六十亿法郎；1957年法国政府又要法兰西银行垫出了五千五百亿法郎。至1957年年底，法国纸币发行量已增加到三万二千六百八十亿法郎。
    通货膨胀结果使法郎一再贬值，物价不断上涨。在过去十一年中，法郎已贬值五次，从1938年的三十四点九六法郎折合一美元，降低到1957年的四百二十法郎合一美元。就是说，以前需要用一个法郎进口的外国货物，现在却需用十二个法郎。
    最近两年来法国物价上涨的现象最为显著。1957年，批发价格上涨了14％，零售价格上涨了15％。如同战前相比，法国目前的零售价格为1938年的三十点五倍，批发价格为二十六倍。
    战后，法国历届政府为了解决它的财政困难，曾千方百计地向人民搜刮，增加人民的税负。例如1947年的直接税和营业税比1938年还只增加四倍，到1955年就增加了五十四倍。在1956年和1957年两年中，单单附加税负担已达到六千八百五十亿法郎。
    国债增加得也很快，到1958年上半年为止，国内债务已达到六万一千八百七十四亿法郎，国外债务达到一万零一百七十五亿法郎。法国今天已是世界上负债最多的国家之一。
    对外贸易逆差、国际支付危机也是促成法国财政和经济危机日益严重的一个重要因素。战后从1946年到1953年，法国的国际支付一直是逆差。1954年和1955年稍有好转，但是1956年后，情况又急转直下。1956年逆差达八亿三千五百万美元，1957年底增加到十五亿美元。黄金外汇储备几乎耗尽。国际收支的危机主要是对外贸易恶化的结果。最近两年来对外贸易逆差更为严重，出口只能弥补进口的71％至73％。1957年的逆差达四千九百二十五亿法郎。这一方面是由于法国在发展工业中，对外国的动力和原料依赖过大，另方面，战争经济也大大增加了对外贸易的逆差。此外，美国与西德的竞争、历届法国政府屈从美国所执行的禁运政策，也大大加深了这个危机。
    这就是摆在戴高乐面前的法国财政经济状况的一付破烂摊子。
      无济于事的办法
    戴高乐上台后，选择独立党领袖比内做财政部长有着两个原因：首先是由于比内在他夺取政权的斗争中出了很大的力气，其次是要利用比内1952年的“宝贵经验”，加紧压榨劳动人民来维持战争经济，缓和日益严重的财政危机。
    五个月来，比内所采取的办法主要有下列几方面：第一，发行了为期五十四年、年利率3.5％的黄金公债。发行结果收回了三千二百多亿法郎（其中二千九百三十亿是现金，三百亿是旧公债的利息归还）和一百五十吨黄金，相当于一亿七千五百万到两亿美元。法国官方拚命吹嘘发行公债的成功，吹嘘黄金、外汇储备已大大改善。但是实际情况怎样呢？我们不妨剥开来看一看：（一）这次公债收回的现款不及1956年那次公债收回得多，1956年有三千二百亿法郎回到了国库。（二）这次收回的黄金只不过占散藏在持有者手中的黄金总量的1.6％。（三）在这次公债中收回的现款赶不上纸币发行的增长。例如从1956年10月到1958年7月，纸币发行额由三万二千四百二十亿增加到三万五千七百亿，就是说在将近二年中，纸币流通量增加了三千二百八十多亿法郎。（四）从这次公债中收回的款额，据估计，即使在目前那样的财政情况下，也只能维持到今年年底。因此，这次公债也只是起暂时救急的作用，并不是解救法国财政困难的什么了不起的办法。
    除了发行新公债以外，戴高乐政府还通过增税和冻结工资的办法来把财政重负转嫁到劳动人民身上。今年7月底，即发行公债后不久，戴高乐政府就决定增加五百亿法郎的捐税。这项增税中包括对公司征收的例外捐税、对住宅征收的市民税、消费税及取消若干免税决定等。同时戴高乐在所谓“吁请法国工人、职员、农民牺牲各自利益，维持法郎的稳定”的借口下冻结了工资。但就在工资被冻结的同时，物价（特别是主要食品价格）仍在不断地上涨。
    另外，戴高乐政府也采取了限制进口、扩大出口的政策。在限制进口方面，7月中，戴高乐政府宣布法国进口仍维持1956年下半年规定的水平，而不恢复1957年6月放宽的水平。同时还采取积极措施鼓励出口：让某些工业部门承担部分产品出口任务；同时减少出口管制。
    戴高乐上台后采取的财政经济方面的这些措施，从表面上看来使法国的黄金、外汇储备有所改善，外贸情况也有一些起色，8月份是法国四年来第一次在国际支付上出现盈余。但是，这种暂时的“好转”并不能维持长久。由于继续进行阿尔及利亚战争，法国的财政困难还要加深。据今年9月份的“政治与经济”月刊报道，在今年初预算为八千八百亿法郎的阿尔及利亚军费已经超支了一千二百亿到一千三百亿法郎，从而达到了超过一万亿法郎的数字。这样预算赤字将大大增加。比内本人已透露今年赤字将达一万亿左右。这就大大超过了原来预计的六千亿法郎的水平。此外，对外贸易逆差仍是一个很大的问题。截至今年8月份为止，法国的对外贸易逆差已达二千八百二十二亿法郎了。
      在危机的边缘上
    由于资本主义世界经济危机的条件愈来愈成熟和近年来刺激法国生产的因素已在逐渐失去作用，法国已开始面临生产过剩的经济危机的威胁。如果说在前一时期，法国经济的“繁荣”和财政危机两种矛盾的现象还同时存在，那么目前在财政危机仍然威胁着法国的同时，生产也开始走下坡路了。连戴高乐本人也不得不在8月1日的广播演说中宣布：法国可能不得不面临经济衰退的威胁。
    法国经济中已出现的危机迹象如下：
    一、生产增长的放慢和下降：法国整个生产指数虽然仍在增长，但是速度显然是在减慢。去年全年法国工业的增长率为10％，但今年上半年法国工业生产只比去年同期增加了8.5％。根据最近的趋势，预计今年下半年法国工业将低于去年同期的水平。在某些部门下降趋势表现得特别显著。例如1958年上半年住宅建筑的情况与去年同期比较，由于政府拨款减少了15％，建筑量就减少了12％。纺织、五金、设备器材、水泥、电气制成品工业中增长速度也都有明显下降。
    二、订货减少。有些部门撤销订货的情况很严重。最突出的是航空工业、造船业、冶金业和纺织业。航空工业自去年年底以来一直没有接到新的订货。冶金业据法兰西银行5月份报告，只有三个月的工作量。这是这门工业多年来最低的订货量。造船业近来被取消的订货相当于四、五个大造船公司一年的工作量，这种情况跟世界航运业危机有密切的关系。纺织部门的订货减少也已显著地影响到生产领域，北部各省的生产已明显发生停滞情况。
    三、企业开工不足，劳动力相对剩余。目前解雇工人和缩短开工时间的现象已经波及法国全境。例如纺织工业、金属工业中的家庭用品部门、电器用具部门、自行车和摩托车工厂、造船业、航空工业都上千地解雇工人。劳动时间也在减少，有的工厂已由每周工作五十小时减至四十小时。这样就影响工人工资收入。这种情况清楚说明：虽然有五十万以上的劳动力被派往阿尔及利亚作战，但是失业还是一天一天在威胁着法国的劳动人民。
    四、销售额下降、存货增加。存货最多的是煤。截至今年6月，煤存量比去年同期几乎增加一倍。在纺织品和家庭用具部门，上半年销售额也下降得非常厉害。
    从这里可以看出，阿尔及利亚战争对法国生产的刺激作用已在逐渐失去，而由于战争所造成的财政困难却愈来愈影响到生产领域。例如盖伊阿政府由于要增加军费就不得不削减进口，法国的棉纺工业就曾因原棉的缺乏而面临危机。此外，在国家削减投资的同时，私人投资额的增长率已减低了。如1958年投资额估计增长将不超过13％，而1957年为18％，1956年为23％。同时劳动人民的不断贫困化直接影响法国的国内贸易。据资产阶级的“回声报”说，1958年7月底的国内贸易额已比去年同期减少了15％。
    法国经济危机的发展是资本主义世界经济危机发展的一个组成部分。法国统治阶级企图通过戴高乐个人独裁，来加强对本国人民和殖民地人民的控制和压榨来缓和它的危机，肯定是做不到的。事实证明，戴高乐上台后，对国内和对殖民地所采取的一系列政策，非但不能缓和，相反地却会加深它所面临的财政和经济危机。
