This newspaper reports that the steel rolling specialty teachers and students of the Steel Metallurgy Department of the Northeast Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Shenyang Steel Rolling Plant, have used indigenous methods to create spindle-less rolling equipment that can directly roll molten steel into steel products. This is a major technological innovation in the steel rolling industry, paving a broad road for indigenous steel rolling.

Since the mass campaign to produce iron and steel using indigenous methods began, the teachers and students of the steel rolling specialty at the Northeast Institute of Technology have begun to study how to carry out steel rolling using the simplest indigenous methods. Although foreigners had experience with spindle-less rolling of iron plates in the past, they had never rolled steel, let alone produced silicon steel sheets in this way. However, the steel rolling specialty teachers and students finally succeeded in their experiments.

The method of spindle-less steel rolling is to directly roll freshly refined molten steel into steel products without going through many intermediate processes such as casting into steel ingots, soaking, blooming, and heating roughing, which saves dozens of times the labor, hundreds of times the construction investment, and greatly reduces costs.

This creation of the Northeast Institute of Technology was successfully researched with the support and encouragement of the Party Branch. With bare hands and in the spirit of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, combining indigenous and foreign methods, the teachers and students of the steel rolling specialty, in collaboration with the Shenyang Steel Rolling Plant, used discarded oxygen cylinders to make rolling mills and channel steel to make machine frames, and finally created spindle-less rolling equipment and successfully trial-rolled silicon steel sheets using molten steel. Currently, they are full of confidence and continuing to study the production of various types of steel using spindle-less rolling methods, so that this indigenous steel rolling method can be widely promoted.

    用钢水直接轧成钢材
    东北工学院制成无锭轧钢设备
    本报讯　东北工学院钢冶系轧钢专业师生和沈阳轧钢厂协作，用土办法制成了无锭轧钢设备，可使钢水直接轧成钢材。这是轧钢工业的一项重大技术革新，为土法轧钢开辟了广阔道路。
    从全民大办土法炼铁土法炼钢以来，东北工学院轧钢专业师生就开始研究如何用最简单的土法进行轧钢。虽然过去外国有无锭轧制铁板的经验，却从未轧过钢材，更从未用这种方式生产矽钢片。但是，轧钢专业师生终于试验成功了。
    无锭轧制钢材的办法，是把刚炼好的钢水不经铸成钢锭、均热、开坯和加热毛轧等很多中间工序，直接轧成钢材，这就节省了几十倍的劳动力，节省了成百倍建设投资，大大降低了成本。
    东北工学院这一创造，是在党总支的支持和鼓励下研究成功的。轧钢专业师生赤手空拳地本着多快好省、土洋结合的精神，在沈阳轧钢厂的协作下，用废氧气瓶制成轧辊，用槽钢制成机架，终于制成无锭轧钢设备，并用钢水试轧成功了矽钢片。目前，他们正满怀信心地继续研究用无锭轧钢方法生产各种类型的钢，以使这种土法轧钢普遍推广。
