Title: The U.S. is Again Engaging in "Air Ceasefire" Conspiracy; Kuomintang Air Force Raids on the Mainland Repeatedly Struck and Badly Mauled; Daring Not to Run Rampant, They Actually Claim to Stop Air Combat

Xinhua News Agency, 12th Dispatch: A United Press International dispatch from Taipei on November 8th reported: "The United States and the Kuomintang authorities are now implementing a kind of air ceasefire over the Formosa Strait," "This is a full-time air ceasefire," "No air combat news has been received since October 10th." The United States "hopes to use this to encourage Beijing to declare a complete abandonment of the use of force in the Formosa Strait." The message also presumptuously stated, "The Communists themselves may have quietly agreed to this ceasefire."

Clearly, this is a remake of the United States' already bankrupt "ceasefire" conspiracy. However, two days after this news was released, at 11:57 AM on November 10th, four American-made F86 Kuomintang aircraft intruded into the airspace over Weitou in Fujian Province. After being fired upon by our anti-aircraft artillery units, they fled in panic. This ruthless fact can be said to be a heavy slap in the face to the United States, which is trying to continue playing the "ceasefire" conspiracy.

The UPI dispatch also stated that from August 14th to October 10th, American-made Kuomintang aircraft shot down "31" of our planes. Among them, in one air combat where the Kuomintang Air Force used American "Sidewinder" missiles, "11 MiG aircraft were shot down." The Kuomintang itself "only lost one American-made Sabre aircraft" during this period. This is truly shameless fabrication. To expose this fabrication, our Air Force Headquarters announced the following facts to this agency: From July 29th to October 10th, our army and the Kuomintang Air Force engaged in a total of thirteen air battles. Our army's aircraft were shot down six and damaged four, while the Kuomintang aircraft lost twenty-three, of which fourteen were shot down and nine were damaged. If you want to ask why the Kuomintang Air Force's activities of harassing the mainland have not been as rampant as in the past since October 10th, then the battle results announced by our Air Force Headquarters can very well explain the problem.

The UPI dispatch also said that the reason why the United States does not want the Kuomintang to continue air combat is that it fears that American jets piloted by the Kuomintang Air Force may be forced to land on the mainland, "in which case important parts of its secret 'Sidewinder' missiles may fall into the hands of the Communists." American officials can be said to be careful. Unfortunately, Mr. Americans, your "Sidewinder" missiles have long been in the hands of the Chinese people and have been exhibited for a month at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, becoming a very good negative example to educate the Chinese people to resolutely fight against the U.S. policy of aggression and war.

### 美国又搞“空中停火”阴谋  国民党空军窜扰大陆屡遭痛击  不敢猖狂肆虐竟说是停止空战

    美国又搞“空中停火”阴谋
    国民党空军窜扰大陆屡遭痛击  不敢猖狂肆虐竟说是停止空战
    新华社12日讯　据合众国际社台北11月8日消息报道：“美国和国民党当局现在正在福摩萨海峡上空实行着一种空中停火”，“这是空中的一种全部时间的停火”，“自从10月10日以来一直没有接到空战的消息”，美国“希望借此能够鼓励北平在福摩萨海峡宣布完全放弃使用武力”。这个消息并且自作聪明地说，“共产党人自己可能已经悄悄地同意了这种停火”。
    很清楚，这是美国早已破产了的“停火”阴谋的翻版。但是，这个消息发表两天之后，在11月10日上午十一时五十七分，四架美制F86型国民党飞机窜入我福建省围头上空，被我高射炮部队射击以后，仓惶逃遁。这个无情的事实，对于企图继续玩弄“停火”阴谋的美国，可以说是狠狠的一记嘴巴。
    合众国际社的消息又说，从8月14日到10月10日，美制国民党飞机一共击毁了我机“三十一架”。其中，在国民党空军使用美国“响尾蛇”导弹的一次空战中，就“击毁十一架米格飞机”。而国民党自己在这期间“仅仅损失了一架美制佩刀式飞机”。这真是恬不知耻的造谣。为了击破这种造谣，我空军司令部向本社宣布以下的事实：从7月29日到10月10日，我军和国民党空军一共进行了十三次空战。我军飞机被击落六架、击伤四架，而国民党飞机却损失了二十三架，其中，被击落的是十四架，击伤的是九架。如果要问，为什么从10月10日以来，国民党空军窜扰大陆的活动不像过去那样猖狂，那么，我空军司令部所宣布的战果倒是很能说明问题的。
    合众国际社的消息还说，美国不愿让国民党继续进行空战的理由是怕国民党空军驾驶的美国喷气机可能被迫降落到大陆，“那样它的秘密的‘响尾蛇’导弹的重要部分就可能落到共产党人手里”。美国官员们可称是小心谨慎的了。可惜，美国先生们，你们的“响尾蛇”导弹早已到了中国人民的手里，并且在北京市劳动人民文化宫展览了一个月，成为教育中国人民坚决同美国的侵略政策和战争政策斗争到底的一个非常好的反面教材。
