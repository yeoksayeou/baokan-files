Xinhua News Agency, 10th - The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel tonight to thank the people from all walks of life in the capital for their warm welcome.

Premier Zhou Enlai and other Party and state leaders, as well as more than a thousand representatives from all walks of life in the capital, including workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, attended tonight's reception. In the spacious banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel, our most beloved people and representatives from all walks of life in the capital were all smiles, drinking the victory wine. The Volunteer Army representatives warmly thanked the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and their homeland relatives for giving them victory and honor; people from all walks of life in the capital constantly toasted the Volunteer Army representatives, thanking their great achievements for bringing great encouragement to the people of the capital and the whole country.

"Victory comes from the Party, from Chairman Mao," this sentence became the common language of more than a thousand people at tonight's reception. When Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, proposed that everyone toast "to the health of Chairman Mao," everyone in the audience raised their glasses, stood up, cheered enthusiastically, and the applause lasted for a long time.

In his enthusiastic speech, Guo Moruo said that since the Volunteer Army delegation returned to the capital, the people of the capital have been as happy and joyous as if it were the New Year.

Guo Moruo said that the Volunteer Army comrades fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, and their heroic achievements are inexhaustible; we must sing their praises today, and we must sing their praises for generations to come.

Guo Moruo said that the Volunteer Army received meticulous care from the heroic Korean people in Korea, and here we would like to express our most sincere gratitude to the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic Government headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, and all the Korean people.

Guo Moruo said that the glory of the Volunteer Army is the glory of all the people of our country, and this glory is given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao. Here we want to warmly thank the Party and Chairman Mao.

Guo Moruo finally said that the Volunteer Army comrades have given us reports in the capital, and the Volunteer Army Art Troupe has given us performances, which have given us great encouragement. They are always the most beloved people.

Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke amidst thunderous applause. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea received strong assistance and cordial care from the Korean people, the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean government, and the Korean people's leader, Comrade Kim Il-sung. Without their help and care, the victorious return of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army would not have been possible.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that for a long time, countless Korean revolutionary comrades have participated in the Chinese revolution. Comrade Kim Il-sung, Comrade Choi Yong-kun, and Ambassador Li Yong-ho and his wife have all participated in China's revolutionary war and helped the Chinese people. We should first thank them and will always commemorate those Korean comrades who sacrificed for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that Premier Kim Il-sung will soon lead a Korean government delegation to visit our country, and we warmly welcome their arrival!

Vice Premier Chen Yi finally proposed a toast to the eternal friendship between China and North Korea. At this time, everyone in the hall happily drank all the wine in their glasses for the friendship between China and North Korea.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho toasted at the reception with great excitement. He said that he could not express the deep feelings of the Korean people for the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese people. He warmly congratulated all officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army for achieving even more brilliant achievements in the cause of building and defending the motherland, congratulated Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party and other leaders of the People's Republic of China on their health, and congratulated the further consolidation and development of the fighting friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples.

Also present at tonight's reception were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Peng Zhen, and Cheng Qian, Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Li Siguang, Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Wentian, heads of various departments of state organs, people's organizations, and democratic parties, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and heads of Beijing's Party and government organs and relevant departments.

General Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, spoke at the beginning of the reception. He said: "Since the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation came to the capital more than ten days ago, it has received meticulous care from Party and state leaders, and has received grand welcomes and warm receptions from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the National Committee of the CPPCC, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, the CPPCC, the Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, as well as various central organs and groups and people from all walks of life in the capital, which makes us infinitely grateful." On behalf of the comrades of the Volunteer Army Delegation and all the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army who have returned to the embrace of the motherland, he once again expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the leaders, comrades, and friends for the honor given to the Volunteer Army.

Yang Yong said: "The great victory achieved by the Chinese people in the movement to resist America and aid Korea and defend the country should first of all be attributed to our beloved Party and Chairman Mao, to the great people of the motherland, the heroic Korean people, and the people of the world who are fighting for peace. If the Volunteer Army has contributed a little bit and achieved a little bit of success in this struggle, then, within the scope of the Volunteer Army, those who should enjoy the honor should also be: the glorious martyrs who sacrificed their lives and the troops and comrades who entered Korea to fight during the most difficult period of the Korean War."

Yang Yong said: "In the past ten days or so, we have been like entering a university of the General Line, and we have seen more specifically the new face of the motherland's Great Leap Forward of one day equaling twenty years. Wherever we go, whether it is a factory, a rural area, an office, or a school, the soaring enthusiasm of the people of the motherland to work hard and make great efforts, and the miraculous creations all deeply attract us."

Yang Yong said: "In this visit to learn from the people of the motherland, we have more deeply felt that the little bit of achievements made by the Volunteer Army in the past eight years are only a drop in the ocean compared with the great achievements of the motherland today in moving mountains and seas and reversing the universe. The little bit of work we have done for the motherland is really not commensurate with the honor given to us today. The example of the Great Leap Forward of the people of the motherland and the honor given to us by the people of the motherland are both encouragement and spur. We must convey everything we have personally felt and seen in these ten days to every commander and fighter, so that it can become the power to spur us to continue our efforts and forge ahead bravely. Together with the people of the whole country, we will catch up with the situation of the Great Leap Forward, immediately participate in the ranks of this Great Leap Forward, and contribute all our strength to the new battle and work posts. We will repay the Party and the people of the motherland with practical actions to defend and build the motherland."

Yang Yong said: "In this era when we are rejoicing and celebrating the Great Leap Forward of the motherland, we feel infinitely angry about the crimes of the American aggressors in continuing to threaten our country with war and creating the conspiracy of 'two Chinas'. We are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and fight for the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu. Here, we extend our warm respect and fraternal greetings to the old brothers of the People's Liberation Army who are guarding the front lines of the motherland's sea defense day and night, and we are determined to learn from their heroic fighting spirit, and when the motherland needs it, we will immediately take up arms to teach a lesson to the American bandits who dare to launch a war of aggression against our country."

At the reception, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Art Troupe, famous Peking Opera actors Shang Xiaoyun, Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Qiu Shengrong, Li Duokui, Zhang Junqiu, Ping Opera actress Xiaobai Yushuang, actress Yan Chunhua from the People's Commune of Xushui County, Hebei Province, and male and female actors from the Shaanxi Opera Troupe to Beijing and the Central Song and Dance Troupe performed wonderful literary and artistic programs. General Yang Yong, Commander of the Volunteer Army, and General Wang Ping, Political Commissar, walked onto the stage amidst warm applause after each program was performed, toasting the actors and thanking them for their performances.

After the reception, a grand dance was held. Party and state leaders and representatives from all walks of life in the capital enjoyed themselves with the most beloved people until late at night. (Picture attached)

    “胜利来自党，来自毛主席”，这句话成了今晚招待会上一千多人的共同语言。在中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若提议大家为“毛主席的健康”而干杯时，全场人人举杯起立，热烈欢呼，经久不息。
    郭沫若在热情洋溢的讲话中说，志愿军代表团回到首都以后，首都人民好像过年一样，非常高兴，非常欢乐。
    郭沫若说，志愿军同志们同朝鲜人民军一道并肩作战，他们树立的丰功伟绩是歌颂不完的；我们今天要歌颂，今后世世代代都要歌颂。
    郭沫若说，志愿军在朝鲜得到了英雄的朝鲜人民的无微不至的爱护，在这里我们要向以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党共和国政府以及全体朝鲜人民表示最衷心的感谢。
    郭沫若说，志愿军的光荣，是我们全国人民的光荣，这光荣是党、是毛主席给我们的，我们在这里要热烈地感谢党，感谢毛主席。
    郭沫若最后说，志愿军同志们在首都给我们作了报告，志愿军文艺工作团给我们作了演出，给了我们巨大的鼓舞，他们永远是最可爱的人。
    陈毅副总理在雷鸣般的掌声中讲话。他说，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜，得到了朝鲜人民、朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民领袖金日成首相同志的大力帮助和亲切关怀，没有他们的帮助和爱护，中国人民志愿军的胜利凯旋是不可能的。
    陈毅副总理说，长时期以来，无数朝鲜革命同志参加了中国革命，金日成同志，崔庸健同志以及李永镐大使和大使夫人同志等都参加过中国的革命战争，帮助了中国人民，我们首先应该感谢他们，并且将永远纪念那些为中国人民革命的胜利而牺牲的朝鲜同志们。
    陈毅副总理说，金日成首相即将率领朝鲜政府代表团访问我国，我们热烈地欢迎他们的到来！
    陈毅副总理最后提议为中朝两国永恒的友谊干杯。这时，大厅里每个人都兴高采烈地为中朝友谊喝尽了自己杯里的酒。
    李永镐大使怀着极大的兴奋心情在招待会上祝酒。他说他没有办法表达出朝鲜人民对中国共产党、毛主席和中国人民的深厚感情。他热烈祝贺志愿军全体官兵在建设祖国和保卫祖国的事业中获得更加辉煌的成就，祝贺毛主席和中国共产党与中华人民共和国其他领导人的健康，祝贺朝中人民的战斗友谊和团结进一步巩固和发展。

    中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将在招待会开始的时候讲话。他说：“中国人民志愿军代表团，到首都十多天来，受到党和国家领导同志无微不至的关怀，受到人大常委会、政协全国委员会、抗美援朝总会、北京市人民委员会、政协、抗美援朝分会，以及中央各机关团体和首都各界人民盛大的欢迎和热情的接待，这使我们无限的感激。”他代表志愿军代表团的同志们，代表回到祖国怀抱的志愿军全体指战员，向首长们、同志们、朋友们给予志愿军的荣誉，再一次致以衷心的感谢。
    杨勇说：“中国人民在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中所取得的伟大胜利，首先应该归功于我们亲爱的党和毛主席，归功于伟大的祖国人民，英雄的朝鲜人民，以及全世界为和平而斗争的人民。如果说，志愿军在这个斗争中出了一点点力，有一点点成绩的话，那末，就志愿军范围来说，应当享受荣誉的，也应该是：光荣牺牲的烈士们和在朝鲜战争最艰苦的时期入朝作战的部队和同志们。”
    杨勇说：“这十多天来，我们像是进了一座总路线的大学一样，更具体地看到了祖国一天等于二十年的大跃进的崭新面貌。我们所到之处，无论是工厂、农村，无论是机关、学校，祖国人民大干、特干的冲天干劲，奇迹般的创造都深深地吸引着我们。”
    杨勇说：“这次向祖国人民学习的参观活动中，我们更深刻地感到志愿军过去八年所取得的一点点成绩，和今天祖国这种移山填海、扭转乾坤的伟大成就相比，正是沧海之一粟。我们为祖国所作的一点点工作，和今天给予我们的荣誉相比，实在是不相称的。祖国人民的大跃进的榜样，祖国人民给予我们的荣誉，对我们既是鼓励，也是鞭策。我们一定要把这十几天来亲身感受、亲自看到的这一切，都传达给每一个指战员，使之成为鞭策我们再接再厉奋勇前进的力量。和全国人民一道，迎头赶上大跃进的形势，立即参加到这个大跃进的行列中来，在新的战斗和工作岗位上，贡献出自己的全部力量。以保卫祖国、建设祖国的实际行动来报答党和祖国人民。”
    杨勇说：“在我们为祖国大跃进而欢欣鼓舞的时代，对美国侵略者继续对我国进行战争威胁的罪行，和制造‘两个中国’的阴谋更感到无比愤怒。我们准备随时响应祖国召唤，为解放台、澎、金、马而奋斗。在这里，我们对日日夜夜守卫在祖国海防前线的解放军老大哥致以热烈的敬意和兄弟的慰问，并决心学习他们英勇战斗的精神，在一旦祖国需要的时候，立刻拿起武器，去教训敢于对我国发动侵略战争的美国强盗。”
