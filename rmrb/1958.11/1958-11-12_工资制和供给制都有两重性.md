Both the Wage System and the Supply System Have a Dual Nature
　　Luo Gengmo

After the national liberation, various regions transitioned from the supply system to the wage system between 1951 and 1953. As for those who were retained and the factories and mines taken over at the time, they continued to use the original wage system without experiencing the transition from the supply system to the wage system, only changing the social nature of their wages. In rural areas, after the individual economy was transformed into the collective economy of cooperatives, the cooperatives implemented a work-point dividend system for their members, transitioning from individual private ownership to the socialist principle of distribution according to work.

Due to changes in living conditions brought about by moving from rural areas to cities, and the fact that the original supply standards were very low (having been slightly raised after national liberation), the supply system, which had been in place for many years, had to be changed. At the same time, the coexistence of two different treatment systems among people working for the state and within the same factory or mine hindered unity and needed to be unified into one system. However, why was the supply system changed to the wage system at that time, rather than the wage system being changed to the supply system? Analysis suggests two main reasons:

Two Reasons for Changing the Supply System to the Wage System

(1) Catering to the Majority: After national liberation, although the supply standards were slightly raised (then called the "overall contract system"), they were generally lower than the wage system (except for some with many children). At that time, the number of people enjoying the wage system in national state organs (including state-owned enterprises) was greater than the number enjoying the supply system. Aligning the former group with the supply system would have resulted in a large scope of change, and due to the recent national liberation and insufficient ideological transformation, it would have been difficult to implement. In particular, private industrial and commercial enterprises had not yet been transformed at that time, and they could not change the wage system. Thus, state-owned enterprises could only continue to use the wage system. At the same time, due to the higher urban living standards and more complex living needs, the leadership should also have taken care of the needs of those who originally enjoyed the supply system.

(2) The Guiding Ideology of Socialist Distribution According to Work: During the transition period from capitalism to socialism and in the socialist stage, due to the insufficient awareness of the people and the insufficient development of productive forces, the distribution of means of subsistence cannot but have considerable differences. This makes the socialist method of distribution according to work necessary, as it can motivate people to improve technology and increase labor productivity. For those who lack the above awareness, the supply system cannot play this role.

Changing the Supply System to the Wage System Was Basically Correct, Only the Understanding of the Principle of Distribution According to Work Was One-Sided

Generally speaking, the aforementioned two reasons for changing the supply system to the wage system were correct (especially considering that at the time, it was not anticipated that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce could be completed in four or five years). Therefore, the reform at that time was also basically correct and played a good role. Some people now say that changing the supply system to the wage system was fundamentally wrong and a complete detour. I think this statement is incorrect. Although looking back from the present, the understanding of the supply system and the principle of distribution according to work at that time was indeed incomplete and contained some errors. For example, people at that time had the error of unilaterally demeaning and completely abandoning the supply system, criticizing it as "whether you work or not, two and a half catties." This only saw the shortcomings that the supply system might bring under certain conditions, but did not see that under the political leadership of our Party, implementing the supply system could achieve unity from top to bottom, with everyone happy to work actively and even willing to sacrifice their lives for the revolution. On the other hand, people at that time only unilaterally saw the advantages of the socialist principle of distribution according to work and the wage system and its necessity in the socialist stage, and forgot that Marx taught us that the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" has not gone beyond the narrow horizon of bourgeois right and is contradictory to communist equality. That is to say, in the socialist stage, if we only know the positive aspects of the principle of distribution according to work and completely follow it to deal with the distribution of social consumption funds, without simultaneously dialectically restricting it and utilizing other transitional forms of distribution (such as the new supply system currently being tested in our country) to intersect with it at a certain time and under certain conditions, then its negative aspects will harm its positive aspects, such as first creating a tendency among cadres and senior intellectuals to separate from the workers and peasants in terms of life and then in terms of consciousness. However, this only shows that if we had had the aforementioned complete understanding of the supply system and the principle of distribution according to work at that time, we could have improved the change from the supply system to the wage system at that time, such as setting the number of levels and the difference between levels of the new wage system replacing the supply system to be fewer and smaller, so as to fully prevent and restrict the negative effects of the aforementioned principle of distribution according to work. As for the change from the supply system to the wage system at that time, based on the aforementioned two reasons, it was still necessary and basically correct.

The Wage System Still Has Its Advantages at the Current Stage, So a Semi-Supply, Semi-Wage System Should Be Implemented

Now, due to the deepening of the socialist revolution, our country has once again seen a brand-new process of appropriately reforming the socialist distribution relationship. It points out that the process of quantitative and qualitative change from the socialist production and distribution relationship to the communist production and distribution relationship is extremely dialectical and complicated. We must have foresight, grasp new things in a timely manner, and make today's socialist construction more in line with the communist direction of tomorrow.

In the past, when changing the supply system to the wage system, we had one-sided views and some shortcomings in specific methods. Today, we are at a turning point in partially changing the wage system (including the work-point dividend system) to the supply system, so we should have a comprehensive view of the supply system and the wage system, and recognize that they both have a dual nature, both have positive and negative aspects. It is completely necessary and correct to point out that in the past, we forgot the progressiveness of the supply system and did not see the shortcomings of distribution according to work, and to advocate the adoption of a new supply system within a certain range. However, I think that we cannot therefore forget that the wage system still has its advantages at the current stage, and that the supply system, under certain circumstances (such as the lack of due political leadership and mass awareness), may also contain the possibility of paralyzing labor enthusiasm. Therefore, we cannot unilaterally only want the supply system and not the wage system at present. The correct way is a supply system plus a wage system (including communes and organs). At the same time, in the wage system, there should also be a reward wage system based on the quality of labor (limited to communes). In urban industrial and mining enterprises, the piece-rate wage system currently needs to be restricted and gradually abolished, and at the same time, we should actively consider how to change the wage system to a supply system plus a wage system.

    工资制和供给制都有两重性
    骆耕漠
    全国解放以后，各地在1951年到1953年，都先后由供给制改行工资制。至于当时全国被留用人员以及接收过来的厂、矿企业则一直沿用原来的工资制，他们没有经历从供给制到工资制的转变过程，只不过变更了工资的社会性质。在农村方面，自个体经济变为合作社的集体经济以后，社对社员实行按劳动日分红制，他们是从个人私有制转到社会主义的按劳分配制。
    由于从农村进入城市，生活条件有所变化，以及原来的供给标准很低（全国解放后曾略有提高），过去已行之多年的供给制必须有所改变。同时，在同为国家工作的人员中以及在同一个厂矿的职工中，有两种待遇制度分别并行着，这亦有碍团结，必须统一为一个制度。但是，当时为什么是将供给制改为工资制，而不是将工资制改为供给制呢？分析起来，主要有以下两个原因。
    供给制改工资制的两个原因
    （一）照顾多数：全国解放以后，供给标准虽然略有提高（当时称为“大包干制”），但是比起工资制来，一般还是低的（部分多子女者除外）。当时全国国家机关（包括国营企业）工作人员中享受工资制的人数多于享受供给制的人数，要将前一部分人都按供给制待遇，其变动面很大，而且由于全国解放不久和思想改造不够，也有不易贯彻之处。特别是当时私营工商业还未改造，它们不能改变工资制，这样，国营企业也只能继续采用工资制。同时，由于城市生活水平较高和生活需要复杂一些，领导上对原享受供给制的人员也应有所照顾。
    （二）社会主义按劳分配的指导思想：在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期以及在社会主义阶段，由于人们的觉悟不够高，以及生产力的发展不够高，生活资料的分配不能不有相当的差别。这使社会主义按劳分配的办法成为必要，它能推动人们改进技术和提高劳动生产率。对缺乏以上觉悟的人来说，供给制就不能起这种作用。
    供给制改工资制基本上是正确的只是认识按劳分配原则有片面性
    总的说来，当年改供给制为工资制所依据的前述两个理由是正确的（特别是当时估计不到资本主义工商业的社会主义改造在四、五年内就可以完成），从而当年的改革也是基本正确的，并起了良好的作用。现在有人说，当年改供给制为工资制是根本错误的，完全走了弯路，我认为这种说法是不对的。虽然从现在来看过去，当时对供给制和按劳分配原则的认识确有不够完整以至含有若干错误的地方。例如，当年人们对供给制有片面贬谪和完全抛弃的错误，批评供给制是“干不干，二斤半”。这是只看到供给制在一定条件下可能带来的缺点，而看不到在我们党的政治领导下推行供给制，可以做到上下团结，大家都乐于积极工作以至不惜为革命献出自己的生命。另一方面，当年人们对社会主义按劳分配原则和工资制只片面地看到它的优点和在社会主义阶段的必要性，而忘记了马克思所教导我们的“各尽所能，按劳取酬”这一原则并未越出资产阶级法权的狭隘天空，它和共产主义的平等是有矛盾的。这就是说，在社会主义阶段，我们如果只知道按劳分配原则的积极方面和完全按照它来处理社会消费基金的分配问题，而不知同时在一定时机、一定条件下辩证地加以限制，并利用其他过渡性的分配形式（如我国现在试行的新供给制）来同它交叉，那么，它的消极方面就会戕害它的积极方面，如在干部中和在高级知识分子中，先造成生活上、后造成意识上脱离工农大众的倾向。但是这只能说明：我们当时对供给制和按劳分配原则如果有了上述那样完整的认识，那就可以把当时供给制改工资制改得更好一些，例如把代替供给制的新工资制的级数和级差定得少一些和小一些，使能充分预防和限制上述按劳分配原则的消极方面的作用。至于当时改供给制为工资制，根据前述两个理由，那还是必需的和基本正确的。
    工资制在现阶段还有它的优越性所以要实行半供给半工资的制度
    现在，由于社会主义革命的深入，我国又出现了对社会主义的按劳分配关系进行适当变革的崭新过程。它指出了从社会主义的生产分配关系到共产主义的生产分配关系的量变和质变过程是极其辩证和错综复杂的，我们必须有预见，及时掌握新鲜事物，使今日的社会主义建设更加符合明日的共产主义方向。
    过去改供给制为工资制时，我们曾有片面观点和在具体办法上有些缺点，今天我们正处在把工资制（包括按劳动日分红制）局部地改变为供给制的转折关头，就应该对供给制和工资制有全面观点，认识它们都有两重性，都有积极的方面和消极的方面。现在指出过去忘了供给制的进步性和看不出按劳分配的缺点，并主张在一定范围内采用新的供给制，这是完全必要的和正确的；但是我认为也不能因此就忘了工资制在目前阶段还有它的优越性，和供给制在一定情况下（如缺乏应有政治领导和群众觉悟）也会含有麻痹劳动积极性的可能性。所以，目前不能一面倒地只要供给制，而不要工资制。正确的办法是供给制加工资制（包括公社和机关），同时在工资制中还应该有按劳动好坏的奖励工资制（限于公社）。在城市工矿企业方面，计件工资制目前有限制和逐渐废除的必要，同时应该积极考虑如何将工资制改为供给制加工资制。
