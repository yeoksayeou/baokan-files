Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Washington dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower said at a press conference on the 5th that the Democratic Party's victory in the congressional elections would not fundamentally change the basic direction of U.S. foreign policy.

The Republican Party's crushing defeat in the election was one of the most frequently asked questions of Eisenhower at this press conference. One reporter asked him if he was worried that Democrats in Congress would force the government to "soften its resistance to communism." Eisenhower replied that he did not know of any responsible Democrat who wanted to change the basic U.S. foreign policy. He said it would be unfair to call the Democratic Party as a whole "appeasers."

Eisenhower said that he was relying on the support of Democratic leaders in Congress in the "free world's" forward battle against the "communist threat" being waged in the United States. He said that U.S. foreign policy would not undergo fundamental changes. Although, he added, the situation is changing every day, requiring some new ways to deal with it.

A reporter asked whether the Eisenhower administration was "weakening" support for "Formosa" (Taiwan) and tending to recognize "two Chinas." Eisenhower did not answer the question directly. But he said, "I often remind people that the problem—sometimes there are factors, the main factors—is gradually changing." He cited the joint communique of the Chiang-Eisenhower talks held last month as an example, saying that Chiang Kai-shek now agreed not to use force to counterattack the mainland and agreed to use only political means to achieve his goals.

Eisenhower added, "You see, in this matter, some things are constantly changing." However, he also made it clear that although the Chiang-Eisenhower talks communique has aroused many reactions, as long as China continues to do things that the United States cannot tolerate, such as refusing to release detained American prisoners, the U.S. government's policy toward Communist China will not change.

When talking about domestic policies, Eisenhower stated that he would continue to maintain existing policies. He focused on the financial and economic difficulties facing the U.S. government, saying that next year the U.S. government must repay a large amount of short-term and long-term public debt, and must also raise 12 billion U.S. dollars in new revenue to pay for inflated military and other expenses, and to make up for losses in tax revenue due to the "recession." He said that unless every possible means is taken to reduce government spending, the dollar will depreciate further and severe inflation will be inevitable.

But he also said that his government would not change the current amount of foreign aid, saying that this was "a matter of maintaining the basic tools that enable the United States to maintain its leadership in the free world."

Eisenhower attributed the Republican Party's defeat to the Republican Party's lack of preparation, and he asked the Republican Party to start working on the 1960 presidential election from this day on. A reporter asked if he would run for a third term as president if the constitution did not limit it. Eisenhower replied that he believed that there should be an age limit for U.S. presidents, and that people over the age of seventy should no longer be president, and that he would be exactly seventy years and three months old at the time of the 1960 election.

### 选举虽遭失败　侵略野心不死  艾森豪威尔叫嚣对华政策不变

    选举虽遭失败　侵略野心不死
    艾森豪威尔叫嚣对华政策不变
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在5日举行的记者招待会上说，民主党在国会选举中的胜利不会使美国外交政策的基本方针有任何改变。
    共和党在选举中遭受惨败是艾森豪威尔在这次记者招待会上被问得最多的一个问题。有记者问他，他是否担心国会中的民主党人会迫使政府“缓和对共产主义的抵抗”，艾森豪威尔回答说，他不知道有任何负责的民主党人想要改变美国的基本外交政策。他说，把民主党作为一个整体称它是“姑息者”是不公平的。
    艾森豪威尔说，在美国进行的“自由世界”反对“共产主义威胁”的前哨战中，他是依靠着国会民主党领袖的支持的。他说，美国外交政策不会有基本的改变。虽然，他又说，现在的局势每天都在变化，需要有些新的办法来应付。
    有记者问，艾森豪威尔政府是否正在“削弱”对“福摩萨”（台湾）的支持并且倾向于承认“两个中国”，艾森豪威尔没有正面答复这个问题。但是他说，“我常常提醒人们注意，问题——有时有一些因素，主要的因素——是逐渐改变的”。他以上月举行的杜蒋会谈公报为例，说这个公报表明，蒋介石现在同意不使用武力反攻大陆，并且同意将只采用政治手段来达到他的目的。
    艾森豪威尔又说，“你们看到，在这个问题中，有些东西是一直在改变的。”不过他同时又表明，尽管杜蒋会谈公报引起了许多反应，只要中国还在做着像拒绝释放被扣押的美国犯人这样一类的美国不能容忍的事情，美国政府对共产党中国的政策就不会改变。
    在谈到国内政策的时候，艾森豪威尔表示他将继续维持现有的政策。他着重谈到美国政府面临的财政和经济的困难，他说，明年美国政府必须偿还大笔短期和长期的公债，还必须筹措一百二十亿美元的新收入以支付膨胀的军事和其他费用，并且弥补由于“衰退”而在税收方面所受到的损失。他说，除非采取每一种可能的办法来减少政府支出，否则，美元将进一步贬值，而严重的通货膨胀将不可避免。
    但是他又表示，他的政府将不改变目前的对外援助的数量，他说这是“保持使美国能够在自由世界中维持其领导地位的基本工具的问题”。
    艾森豪威尔把这次共和党的失败归诸于共和党没有准备，他要求共和党从这一天开始就来着手1960年的总统选举。有记者问，如果宪法不限制，他还会不会竞选第三届连任的总统。艾森豪威尔回答说，他认为美国总统应该有一个年龄的限制，满七十岁的人不应该再当总统，而他在1960年大选的时候将刚刚是七十岁零三个月。
