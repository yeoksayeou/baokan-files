    Planting More Sword Beans in Mountainous Areas
    In the mountainous areas of Xingyi County, Guizhou, many bare hillsides are covered with clusters of sword beans. The already withered corn stalks are also entwined with the green branches and leaves of sword beans. Even though it is late autumn, these hillsides look as beautiful as spring.
    Sword beans, also known locally as "mao dao dou," are rich in starch and can be used as food, made into flour, brewed into wine, or used as feed. They are a good "treasure" of the mountainous areas.
    Generally, each plant can yield more than one jin, and the highest can yield six jin. When intercropped in cornfields, each mu can yield three to four hundred jin. Its roots take up very little land, and the branches and leaves climb on bare rocks or the trunks of trees on the edge of the land. If intercropped with corn, its branches and leaves flourish only after the corn matures, climbing up the withered corn stalks.
    When sword beans are not ripe, the pods have a lot of hair, and the shell is thick, making them less susceptible to birds, animals, and insect pests. At the same time, they are not afraid of severe cold or heat, and they are drought-resistant, making them easy to manage. Therefore, I suggest that mountainous areas plant more sword beans.

### 山区多种狗儿豆

    山区多种狗儿豆
    在贵州兴义县的山区，许多光秃秃的山坡上爬满了一簇簇的狗儿豆，已经枯黄的玉米秆上也缠满了狗儿豆的绿色枝叶，虽是深秋，看上去这些山坡却像春天一样美。
    狗儿豆当地又叫毛刀豆，含有丰富的淀粉，可作粮食，也可制粉、酿酒或作饲料。是山区的一个好“宝贝”。
    狗儿豆一般每株可收一斤多，最高的一株可收六斤。在玉米地里间种，每亩可收三、四百斤。它的根部占地很少，枝叶都攀缠在光秃的岩石上或土边地角的树干上生长，若是和玉米间作，它的枝叶正好在玉米成熟以后才茂盛，攀缠着玉米枯秆往上长。
    狗儿豆没成熟的时候，豆荚上有很多毛，壳也厚，不容易遭到鸟、兽、虫害。同时它不怕严寒、不怕热，又耐旱，管理起来也方便。因此我建议山区可多种点狗儿豆。
