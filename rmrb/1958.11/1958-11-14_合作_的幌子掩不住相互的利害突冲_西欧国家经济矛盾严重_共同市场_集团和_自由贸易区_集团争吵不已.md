Xinhua News Agency, London, November 13th (Reporter Peng Di): The increasingly fierce economic contradictions among Western European countries are threatening to split Western Europe into two or more incompatible trade protectionist blocs.

The Western European "Common Market" will be established on January 1, 1959. At that time, the six member states (West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) will begin to reduce tariffs by 30%, expand trade quotas by 20%, and adopt other protective measures among themselves, while erecting discriminatory barriers against countries outside the six. This bloc, with West Germany at its core and the United States manipulating it from behind, poses a serious threat to other Western European countries, especially Britain, because capitalist Britain relies heavily on export trade for its survival.

For months, Britain has been trying to deal with this threat. It has proposed establishing a broader "Free Trade Area" in Western Europe on terms favorable to Britain, to link the "Common Market" six with the other members of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation." Britain and the Common Market countries have been negotiating on the "Free Trade Area" issue, but the negotiations have been protracted and fruitless. One of the points of contention is that Britain intends to establish a "Free Trade Area" in order to benefit from the Western European market (which often accommodates a quarter of British exports), while at the same time maintaining its imperial preference system with Commonwealth countries (Commonwealth countries' markets often accommodate half of British exports).

France originally found it difficult to agree to the establishment of the "Common Market"; it only signed the agreement on the "Common Market" after West Germany made concessions. It is very afraid of British competition. French industry is heavily protected, and if France were to engage in a "Free Trade Area" with a country like Britain that has very low external tariffs, it would suffer serious damage, because British goods would certainly be cheaper, and the raw materials for British goods from the Commonwealth region are subject to very low tariffs.

Therefore, Britain's plan has met with strong opposition from the "Common Market" countries, especially France.

Recently, the British government has been desperately trying to reach some kind of agreement on the "Free Trade Area" issue before the "Common Market" is established on January 1 next year. Reginald Maudling, the British minister in charge of free trade area negotiations, said on the 11th that the date is of great significance because the six countries will take some action on that date, and if this action is not accompanied by other things (conditions), it could lead to very serious problems and the division of Western Europe.

Maudling was in Paris last month, and is in Paris again today – making final efforts to negotiate at the meeting of the seventeen-nation "Organization for European Economic Cooperation". French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville also held fruitless talks with the British government on the "Free Trade Area" issue during his recent visit to London. All indications so far suggest that the possibility of successful "Free Trade Area" negotiations is even less than before.

With no hope of breaking this deadlock, a group of six non-"Common Market" countries led by Britain is organizing an opposing bloc to deal with the serious impact of the "Common Market's" discriminatory measures. Leading industry representatives from Britain, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, and Switzerland are currently meeting in Paris. In a joint statement, they said that if an agreement on the "Free Trade Area" issue cannot be reached soon, there is a serious danger that Western Europe will be economically and politically divided, and that the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" and the "European Payments Union" will collapse. A major crisis in Western European economic relations is emerging, with the six "Common Market" countries on one side and the six non-Common Market countries on the other entering their positions in an economic war. The "Daily Mail" editorial on the 11th pointed out that the "Free Trade Area" negotiations are in danger of collapsing. The newspaper said that "it may split into at least two hostile blocs."

    “合作”的幌子掩不住相互的利害突冲
    西欧国家经济矛盾严重
    “共同市场”集团和“自由贸易区”集团争吵不已
    新华社伦敦13日电　本社记者彭迪报道：西欧国家之间的日益激烈的经济矛盾，大有把西欧分裂成为两个或两个以上的互不相容的贸易保护性集团之势。
    西欧“共同市场”将在1959年1月1日成立。到那时，六个成员国（西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡）将在它们之间开始削减关税30％、扩大贸易限额20％并且采取其他保护性措施，而对六国以外的国家树起歧视性的壁垒。这种以西德为核心并有美国在背后操纵的集团对其他西欧国家特别是英国来说，是严重的威胁，因为资本主义的英国的生存大部分是依靠出口贸易的。
    几个月来，英国一直在设法对付这种威胁。它建议根据有利于英国的条件在西欧建立范围更广泛的“自由贸易区”，以使“共同市场”六国同“欧洲经济合作局”的其他成员国联系起来。英国和共同市场国家一直在就“自由贸易区”问题进行谈判，谈判旷日持久而毫无结果。争执点之一是：英国打算建立“自由贸易区”以便从西欧市场取得好处（西欧市场经常容纳了英国出口货的四分之一），而同时又要保持它同英联邦国家的帝国优惠制（英联邦国家市场经常容纳了英国出口货的一半）。
    法国本来感到难以同意建立“共同市场”，它只是在西德作了让步以后才签订关于“共同市场”的协定的。它非常害怕英国的竞争。法国工业是受到很大保护的，如果法国跟英国那样的对外关税很低的国家一起搞“自由贸易区”，它就会遭到严重的损害，因为英国货一定是比较便宜的，英国货的来自英联邦地区的原料所付的关税是很低的。
    因此，英国的计划遭到“共同市场”国家、特别是法国的坚决反对。
    最近，英国政府拼命争取在“共同市场”在明年1月1日成立以前在“自由贸易区”问题上达成某种协议。英国负责自由贸易地区谈判的大臣雷金纳德·莫德林11日说，日期是有重要意义的，因为六个国家将会在那个日期采取某种行动，如果这种行动不附加另外一些东西（条件）的话，就可能导致非常严重的问题和西欧的分裂。
    莫德林上月在巴黎，今天又在巴黎——在为十七国“欧洲经济合作局”会议上的谈判作最后的努力。法国外交部长德姆维尔在最近访问伦敦期间也同英国政府就“自由贸易区”问题举行了毫无成果的会谈。迄今为止的一切迹象表明，“自由贸易区”谈判成功的可能性比以前更少了。
    由于没有希望打破这种僵局，由英国为首的六个非“共同市场”国家正在组织一个对立的集团，来对付“共同市场”的歧视措施将造成的严重影响。来自英国、挪威、丹麦、瑞典、奥地利和瑞士的主要工业界代表目前正在巴黎开会。他们在联合声明中说，如果不能很快就“自由贸易区”问题达成协议，就有这样严重的危险：西欧在经济上和政治上处于分裂状态，“欧洲经济合作局”和“欧洲支付同盟”瓦解。西欧经济关系中的主要危机正在出现，六个“共同市场”国家一方和六个非共同市场国家另一方都在经济战争状态中进入了它们的阵地。“每日邮报”11日的社论指出，“自由贸易区”谈判有濒于破裂的危险。这家报纸说，“可能至少分裂成为两个敌对的集团”。
