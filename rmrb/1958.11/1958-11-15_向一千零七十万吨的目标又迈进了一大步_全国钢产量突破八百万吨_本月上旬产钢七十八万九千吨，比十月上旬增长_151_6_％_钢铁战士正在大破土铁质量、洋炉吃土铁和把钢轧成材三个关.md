Xinhua News Agency, 14th: After large-scale high-production movements in September and October, national steel production has begun to stabilize in early November. Currently, great efforts are being made to improve the quality of steel and ensure that iron can be turned into steel and steel can be turned into materials. The new task currently facing the national steel front is to overcome three hurdles: the quality of indigenous iron, the "foreign" furnaces' consumption of indigenous iron, and the rolling of steel into materials.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, by November 10th, the national steel output this year had exceeded the 8 million-ton mark, accounting for 75.3% of the annual target of 10.7 million tons of steel. In many areas, after the intense high-yield week at the end of October, although some furnaces are being repaired and some labor has been transferred to agricultural production, steel production is still rising steadily. From the 1st to the 10th, the country produced a total of 789,000 tons of steel and 2,133,000 tons of iron. The average daily output of steel increased by 151.6% compared with the first ten days of October, and pig iron increased by 217.3%.

While continuing to maintain high output, various regions have begun to pay serious attention to improving the quality of steel production. In order to expand the proportion of first-class iron, eliminate sintered iron, and reduce second-class iron, many regions have strengthened the testing and acceptance of pig iron, and launched a technological innovation campaign centered on improving quality. Henan Province mobilized the iron and steel army to carry out a high-quality iron refining campaign. Anyang County alone posted more than 30,000 big-character posters, fiercely attacking various conservative ideas, and put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals. In order to improve quality, the masses in various places worked day and night to improve furnace types, equipment, and operating techniques. After indigenous blast furnaces in You County, Zixing, Lianyuan and other places in Hunan Province were modified to use hydraulic and mechanical blowing and generally increased air volume and pressure, they have achieved good iron output from every furnace, and high-quality iron accounts for more than half of the total pig iron output. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region adopted a "two-step" approach, first using large kilns to refine ore into sintered iron, and then using small blast furnaces to refine it into pig iron. The proportion of gray cast iron has accounted for 30% to 70%.

In terms of improving the quality of indigenous steel, various regions have begun to adopt methods such as tapping molten steel, casting steel ingots, and forging indigenous steel into small steel ingots, so that indigenous steel, which was originally limited in its scope of use due to its small size, can be rolled into various steel products. However, at present, many regions do not pay enough attention to improving the quality of indigenous steel. At the same time, due to the lack of steel rolling equipment, some steel ingots cannot be rolled into steel. Therefore, relevant departments require that while paying attention to improving the quality of steel, all regions must seize the manufacturing and installation of steel rolling equipment.

The key enterprises, which are responsible for more than half of the country's steel production, have also improved their production levels to varying degrees in the past ten days. For example, the output of Tangshan Steel Plant on November 5 increased by more than 90% compared with the average daily output in October. After launching mass debates, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has improved the rolling capacity of various steel rolling plants. At present, the biggest difficulties in the production of these key enterprises are: first, the lack of steelmaking raw materials, especially high-quality pig iron, which prevents the full utilization of equipment capacity; and second, the excessive content of impurities such as sulfur and phosphorus in indigenous iron, which affects the quality of steel. Solving the raw material problem of key enterprises is the key to ensuring a bumper harvest in both output and quality of the steel industry this year. Therefore, in addition to requiring all regions to continue to pay great attention to improving the quality of pig iron and transferring good iron to support the production of key enterprises, relevant departments also require all enterprises to continue to mobilize workers to fight against impurities in indigenous iron and further study technically how to overcome the problem of excessive sulfur content.

    向一千零七十万吨的目标又迈进了一大步
    全国钢产量突破八百万吨
    本月上旬产钢七十八万九千吨，比十月上旬增长151.6％
    钢铁战士正在大破土铁质量、洋炉吃土铁和把钢轧成材三个关
    新华社14日讯　全国钢铁生产在经过9、10两月大规模高产运动以后，11月上旬开始稳定下来，目前正在大力提高钢铁质量，保证铁能成钢，钢能成材。全国钢铁战线目前面临的新任务是过好三关，即土铁质量关，洋炉子吃土铁关，把钢轧成钢材关。
    根据冶金工业部的统计，到11月10日止，今年全国的钢产量已经突破八百万吨大关，占全年任务一千零七十万吨钢的75.3％。许多地区在10月底紧张的高产周以后，虽然一部分炉子正在休整，部分劳动力已经转入农业生产，但是，钢的产量仍然在稳步上升。从1日到10日，全国共计产钢七十八万九千吨，产铁二百一十三万三千吨。平均日产量钢比10月上旬增长了151.6％，生铁增长了217.3％。
    在继续保持高产的同时，各地开始认真地注意提高钢铁生产的质量。许多地区为了扩大一类铁的比重，消灭烧结铁和减少二类铁，都加强了对生铁的化验和验收工作，并且开展了以提高质量为中心的技术革新运动。河南省发动钢铁大军开展炼优质铁运动，仅安阳县就贴出了三万多张大字报，猛攻各种保守思想，并且提出了数以万计的合理化建议。各地群众为了提高质量，废寝忘食地在那里改进炉型、设备和操作技术。湖南省攸县、资兴、涟源等地的土高炉在改用水力和机械鼓风、普遍增加风量和风压以后，已经做到炉炉出好铁，优质铁占到全部生铁产量的一半以上。广西僮族自治区采用“两步走”的办法，先用大窑把矿石炼成烧结铁，再用小高炉炼成生铁，灰口铁的比重已经占到30％到70％。
    在提高土钢的质量方面，各地开始采用出钢水、铸成钢锭，以及把土钢锻打成小型钢锭的办法，以便使原来因体积过小而使用范围不广的土钢，能轧制成各种钢材。但是目前许多地区对提高土钢的质量注意得还是不够的。同时由于轧钢设备不足，有些钢锭不能轧成钢材。因此，有关部门要求各地在注意提高钢的质量的同时，必须抓紧轧钢设备的制造和安装工作。
    担负着全国一半以上钢产任务的重点企业，这一旬的生产水平也有不同程度的提高。如唐山钢厂11月5日一天的产量就比10月份平均日产量提高了90％以上。鞍山钢铁公司在发动群众大辩论以后，各轧钢厂的轧钢能力都有了提高。目前，这些重点企业生产中最大的困难，一是缺乏炼钢原料，特别是质量优良的生铁，因而设备能力不能充分发挥；二是土铁中含硫、磷等杂质过高，影响钢的质量。解决重点企业的原料问题，是保证今年钢铁工业产量和质量双丰收的关键。因此，有关部门除了要求各地继续大力注意提高生铁的质量，把好铁调运出来支援重点企业生产以外，还要求各企业继续发动职工向土铁中的杂质作斗争，在技术上进一步研究如何克服含硫过高的问题。
