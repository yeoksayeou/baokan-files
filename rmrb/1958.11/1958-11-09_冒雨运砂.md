    Transporting Sand in the Rain
    Chi Fachun, Qingdao State-owned Cotton Factory No. 4
    In the morning, heavy clouds rolled in the sky, with occasional drizzles. More than a dozen small pushcarts were waiting in front of the gate of Qingdao State-owned Cotton Factory No. 4, ready to depart for Liuqing River to transport quartz sand.
    Li Ruishi, the branch secretary of Weaving Department C Class, was busy checking the transportation tools for this "expedition" team. Suddenly, a girl around twenty years old ran over breathlessly and asked as her first question, "Secretary Li, why didn't the expedition call for me?"
    Secretary Li asked back with a smile, "Look at this team, is there a woman?"
      "Why don't you want women?" the girl asked a little unconvinced. "Does transporting sand only work for men, and not for women? Didn't we transport refractory clay yesterday?..."
    This girl is called Chen Xiulan, and she is a shuttle changer in Weaving Department B Class. Since the start of the Great Leap Forward for Steel Production, she has been very active in transportation. It seems that not letting her go today is not an option. But Secretary Li still wanted to persuade her: "Xiulan, look how bad the weather is, what if it rains heavily?"
    "If it rains, aren't men afraid? The rain doesn't only fall on women and not men!..."
    They set off. The rain became heavier and heavier, and the road became more and more slippery. Everyone was worried about Chen Xiulan, but she walked on as if she didn't care. At four o'clock in the afternoon, they arrived at Liuqing River beach. The raging wind stirred up waves on the sea that were several yards high, madly crashing towards the shore. On the soft beach, people's feet sank into the sand with every step. Everyone carrying sand was soaked like a drowned rat. At this time, not to mention carrying a large sandbag weighing more than two hundred pounds, even walking empty-handed required a lot of effort. Chen Xiulan picked up a bag of sand and felt like she had no strength in her feet, her body was swaying, and beads of sweat were flowing inside her clothes against her skin, while the outside of her clothes was ice-cold rainwater and seawater.
    After carrying the sand back, the torrential rain continued to pour down. The wheels were especially difficult to move on the muddy road. Suddenly, a cart in front stopped, and someone said to Xiulan, "We're at Wuligang!" "Let's take a short break. We need a burst of energy to pull the cart up the five-li slope!"
    "Just pull it, I guarantee I won't be a coward. Our 'expedition' is only two hundred *li*, the Red Army wasn't afraid of the 25,000-li Long March!"
    No one took a break, and the carts continued to pull uphill.

    冒雨运砂
  　青岛国棉四厂　迟法春
    早晨，浓云在天空翻滚，不时地下着小雨点。十几辆小地排车在国棉四厂门口待命出发，到流清河去运石英砂。
    织部丙班的支部书记李瑞世正在忙着为这支“远征队”检查运输工具，突然，一个二十岁上下的姑娘气喘吁吁地跑来了，第一句话就问：“李书记，远征为什么不叫我去呵？”
    李书记笑眯眯地反问：“你看这支队伍里，有一个女的没有？”
      “为什么不要女的呢？”姑娘有点不服气地问道：“难道拉砂光兴男的干，就不兴女的干啦？我们昨天不是去拉过耐火土吗？……”
    这个姑娘叫陈秀兰，是织部乙班的换梭工。从钢铁大战一开始，她就一直很积极地搞运输。看来今天不让她去是不行了。李书记却还想说服她：“秀兰，你看天气多不好，如果下大雨怎么办？”
    “下雨，男的就不怕吗？雨又不是光淋女的不淋男的！……”
    他们上了路。雨越下越大，路也越走越滑，大家都担心陈秀兰，但她却满不在乎地走着。走到下午四点，到了流清河海滩。狂风掀起海上的巨浪足有几丈高，疯狂地向着海岸猛扑。松软的沙滩上，人的脚一踏下去，就被沙埋住了，抬砂的人个个被淋得像落汤鸡似的，这时候，不用说抬二百多斤重的大砂包，就是空着手走路，每走一步也要费很大的劲。陈秀兰抬起一包砂来，就觉得脚底下一点劲也没有了，身子乱摇晃，豆大的汗珠在衣服里面贴着皮肤流动，衣服外面却是冰凉的雨水和海水。
    抬了砂回去，倾盆大雨还是一个劲地往下倒。车轮在泥泞的路上格外难走。忽然，前面一辆车停下了，有人对秀兰说：“到了五里岗啦！”“稍微歇一歇吧。五里地的上坡要一股劲的拉上去呢！”
    “拉就拉呗，我保险熊不了。咱这才二百里的‘远征’，人家红军二万五千里长征都没有害怕过！”
    谁也没有歇一下，车子又向崖上拉去。
