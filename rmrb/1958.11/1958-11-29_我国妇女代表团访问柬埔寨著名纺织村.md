Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 27th. Residents of the Prek Ta Kov village in Kandal Province, Cambodia, famous for its textiles, warmly welcomed the visit of the Chinese Women's Delegation this morning.

Twenty years ago, this village became a textile center, capable of producing no less than ten kinds of exquisite hand-woven sarongs (a type of skirt) and scarves.

When the Chinese Women's Delegation arrived at the village by motorboat along the Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodian textile workers specially brought out their wooden looms and demonstrated weaving under the shade of trees. The beautifully designed sarongs, inlaid with colorful silk threads, gold threads, and silver threads, won great admiration from the Chinese guests.

Governor Patievong and his wife received the Chinese Women's Delegation here with fresh fruit and presented each member of the delegation with a sarong. The delegation also presented some gifts to the governor and his wife, as well as a Cambodian female textile worker.

    我国妇女代表团访问柬埔寨著名纺织村
    新华社金边27日电　柬埔寨干丹省以纺织著名的普来克塔考村的居民今天上午热烈欢迎中国妇女代表团的访问。
    二十年以前，这个村就成了纺织中心，能够生产不下十种高贵的手织纱笼（一种围裙）和围巾。
    当中国妇女代表团乘汽艇沿着洞里湖到达这个村庄时，柬埔寨纺织工人特别搬出他们的木机，在树荫下表演纺织。设计美观的纱笼上镶织着彩色缤纷的丝线、金线和银线等，博得了中国客人极大的赞赏。
    省长帕提翁和夫人在这里用新鲜水果招待中国妇女代表团，并且赠给每个团员一件纱笼。代表团也把一些礼物送给省长和他的夫人以及一位柬埔寨纺织女工。
