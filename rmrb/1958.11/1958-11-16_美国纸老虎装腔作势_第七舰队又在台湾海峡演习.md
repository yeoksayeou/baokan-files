Xinhua News Agency, November 14th, Taipei Dispatch: The U.S. Seventh Fleet and the U.S. Air Force units invading Taiwan yesterday conducted a show-of-force joint sea and air exercise in the Taiwan Strait in order to maintain tension in the Taiwan Strait area. According to U.S. news agency reports, during the exercise, some U.S. aircraft dropped napalm bombs, turning a sea area into a "sea of fire for nearly twenty minutes." Other aircraft launched rockets, and U.S. nuclear bombers also conducted "atomic bomb dropping" exercises with substitutes over the Taiwan Strait.

The report said that aircraft from three U.S. aircraft carriers participated in this exercise involving war provocation and atomic intimidation. The flagship of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, the USS "Helena," along with two destroyers and other ships, also participated in the exercise in the waters north of Taiwan, as well as some "U.S.-aid" ships of Chiang Kai-shek's navy. The 11th Marine Air Group also dispatched aircraft from Taiwan to bomb simulated targets.

The report said that the Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Hopwood, the Commander of U.S. Forces Invading Taiwan, Smoot, and the U.S. "Ambassador" to Taiwan, Drumwright, all reviewed this provocative exercise. They also invited Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng, Chiang Ching-kuo, and a group of Chiang's military generals to "observe."
