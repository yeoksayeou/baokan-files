Xinhua News Agency, November 16th: Many fraternal countries' newspapers on the 15th commented with enthusiastic praise on Khrushchev's report outline regarding the "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1959-1965."

The Albanian "People's Voice" published an editorial saying: The magnificent seven-year plan formulated by the Soviet Union is a plan to mobilize all the creativity of the Soviet people.

The German Socialist Unity Party's central organ, "Neues Deutschland," emphasized that the figures in the outline indicate that the Soviet Union will achieve an unprecedented upsurge in its national economy in the next seven years. The seven-year plan is a continuation of the peaceful competition with the capitalist world. By 1965, the total industrial output of all socialist countries will reach half of the world's total industrial output.

All Polish newspapers published Khrushchev's report outline on the 15th. "People's Tribune" called this outline the "Economic Program for Soviet Communist Construction."

The Romanian "Spark" published an editorial stating that the seven-year plan formulated by the CPSU showed the Soviet people a vision of development, turning humanity's aspired ideal—communism—into a concrete goal about to be realized.

All Hungarian national newspapers published excerpts of Khrushchev's report outline in prominent positions. "People's Voice" wrote in large headlines: "The Seven-Year Plan Stipulates that the Soviet National Economy Will Achieve Enormous Development."

The Mongolian working people carefully studied the Soviet plan outline for the development of the national economy. Professor Nachagdorj, Deputy Doctor of History, said in the newspaper that the realization of the seven-year plan by the Soviet people is of great significance for enhancing the economic strength and defense capabilities of the entire socialist camp and for further consolidating the strength of the international peace movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 16th: The Korean "Workers' Daily" published a commentary today, stating that the Korean people are as happy as if it were their own affair about Comrade Khrushchev's report outline on the control figures for the Soviet seven-year prospective plan, and believe that the great leap forward of the Soviet people will promote the socialist construction of the Korean people and the final victory of the Korean revolution.

The commentary stated that this report outline is a great source of encouragement not only for the Soviet people but also for the people of all countries fighting for peace and socialism, as well as the international workers' movement and the peace movement. The victory achieved by the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union in socialist and communist construction is a decisive victory for the cause of world peace.
