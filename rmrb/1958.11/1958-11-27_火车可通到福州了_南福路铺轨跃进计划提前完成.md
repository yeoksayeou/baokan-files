Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 26th -- The important southeastern city of Fuzhou will soon be accessible by train. The second major railway artery in Fujian Province, the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway, completed its track-laying at its terminal station – Fuzhou Station – on the 26th, 35 days ahead of the original leap forward plan.

At 9:50 AM on the 26th, as the last pair of spikes were hammered in, the sounds of train whistles, firecrackers, and applause erupted, celebrating the victory of the Nanfu Railway track-laying. Gao Qingjiu, member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Governor of Fujian Province, Zhang Chuandong, Secretary of the Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and hundreds of youths and Young Pioneers, who had just personally hammered in the spikes, immediately stepped forward to present bouquets of flowers to the officers and soldiers of a certain railway corps of the People's Liberation Army, the civilian workers, and the drivers of the track-laying train, warmly shaking their hands to express their gratitude.

The weather in Fuzhou on the 26th was sunny, and although it was early winter, it was still warm as spring. Hearing the news of the track-laying reaching Fuzhou, people from all walks of life in the city, dressed in festive attire and holding colorful flags and flowers, gathered at the Fuzhou Station Square in eastern Fuzhou from early morning. Starting at 11:00 AM, a celebration rally with over 10,000 participants was held.

The completion of the Nanfu Railway will play a significant role in developing the industrial and agricultural production and foreign trade of Fuzhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Min River area, as well as consolidating the coastal defense in the southeast. The railway is 168 kilometers long, starting from Nanping Station on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, crossing the rapidly flowing Min River, and extending southeast along the left bank of the Min River. It passes through the high mountains and cliffs of the Min River valley and the turbulent tributaries of the Min River, reaching Fuzhou. The entire project was arduous, involving the excavation and filling of more than 14.6 million cubic meters of earth and stone, the construction of 57 bridges, and 416 culverts. Construction began in March 1956, and thanks to the hard work and ingenuity of the officers and soldiers of a certain railway corps of the People's Liberation Army and more than 10,000 civilian workers, the entire line was completed ahead of schedule, with actual construction taking only thirteen months.

The Nanfu Railway passes through three counties and cities, including Gutian, Minqing, and Minhou. The area along the railway is rich in resources. After the railway opens to traffic, rice, aquatic products, citrus fruits, olives, and the famous scented tea and bodiless lacquerware, which are abundant in Fuzhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Min River, will be transported to various parts of the province and the country. The abundant coal, iron, manganese, and aluminum mineral resources and the Min River water conservancy will also be gradually developed. Industrial products such as steel, machinery, cement, and chemical fertilizers needed in Fuzhou and other places will also be transported from all over the country. Since the Nanping to Eyang section of the railway began freight operations at the beginning of this year, a total of more than 385,000 tons of materials such as steel, machinery, cement, wood, and salt have been transported in and out by the end of October, reducing the burden on Min River shipping and saving the country 2 million yuan in transportation costs.

    火车可通到福州了
    南福路铺轨跃进计划提前完成
    据新华社福州26日电　我国东南重镇福州市不久可以通行火车了。福建省第二条铁路大动脉——南（平）福（州）铁路在26日铺轨到终点站——福州车站，比原订跃进计划还提前三十五天。
    26日上午九点五十分，当钉最后一对道钉的叮当声刚刚停止，霎那间汽笛声、鞭炮声和鼓掌声四起，人们欢庆南福铁路铺轨的胜利。刚刚亲手钉过道钉的中共福建省委委员、福建省副省长高磬九、中共福州市委书记张传栋和上百个青年、少先队员，立即上前把一束束鲜花献给担负铺轨任务的铁道兵某部官兵、民工和铺轨列车的司机们，并热烈和他们握手表示感谢。
    26日，福州市天气晴朗，虽然时届初冬，仍然温暖如春。喜闻铺轨到福州的全市各界人民，穿着节日的服装，手持彩旗和鲜花，从清晨起陆继汇集在福州东部的福州车站广场上，从十一时开始，召开有一万多人参加的庆祝大会。
    南福铁路的建成，对发展福州和闽江中、下游地区的工农业生产、对外贸易和巩固东南沿海海防，都将起重大的作用。这条铁路全长一百六十八公里，从鹰厦铁路上的南平车站出发，跨过水流湍急的闽江，沿闽江左岸向东南伸展，穿过闽江狭谷地区的高山峭壁和湍急的闽江支流，到达福州。全线工程艰巨，共计挖掉和填垫土石方一千四百六十多万公方，架设桥梁五十七座，涵洞四百一十六处。它在1956年3月开始兴建，经过人民解放军铁道兵某部官兵和一万多名民工的苦干和巧干，提前全线修通，实际施工时间仅十三个月。
    南福铁路经过古田、闽清、闽侯等三个县、市，沿线物产丰富，通车以后，福州和闽江中下游盛产的稻谷、水产、柑桔、橄榄和著名的香花茶叶、脱胎漆器等，将更多地运往省内外各地。蕴藏丰富的煤、铁、锰、铝矿产和闽江水利，也将逐步得到开发，福州等地所需的钢材、机器、水泥、化肥等工业品，也将源源从全国各地运来。这条铁路的南平到莪洋段从今年年初开办货运业务以来，到10月底止共计运进和运出钢材、机器、水泥和木材、食盐等物资三十八万五千多吨，减轻了闽江航运的负担，并为国家节省二百万元的运费。（附图片）
