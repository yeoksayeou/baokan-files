    Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace Great Leap Forward
    Daily Output Once Exceeded Design Targets
    (According to Changjiang Daily) The “Big Ocean Group” movement at Wuhan Iron and Steel is being pioneered at the No. 1 blast furnace. On November 15th, the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 blast furnace produced 2,214 tons of pig iron, exceeding the design target by 144 tons.
    Recently, workers at the Iron Smelting Plant launched a mass airing of views, a mass debate, for high blast furnace output. In two or three days, workers posted more than 1,700 big-character posters, criticizing shortcomings in management and other aspects, and offering suggestions on how to achieve high output. After the big-character posters were put up, debates were also held. Some technicians were afraid that feeding the furnace too quickly or increasing the air volume would lead to accidents; the workers believed that they should not just be passively afraid, but should actively think of ways to increase production. Some workers also cited past examples of Anshan daring to speak and daring to act to increase production, persuading a few technicians. At the same time, workers conducted self-criticism for their inattentive operations, which had resulted in molten iron flowing out several times.
    After the debate, a new atmosphere immediately emerged at the Iron Smelting Plant. The "two participations and one reform" system began to be implemented, with leading cadres frequently operating in front of the furnace. Technicians and workers became harmonious, workers from the three shifts united, and leading cadres and technicians consulted with workers on everything. A new style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act emerged throughout the plant. Now the No. 1 blast furnace is beginning to operate with the world's most advanced high-pressure furnace top. The higher the pressure, the greater the heat, and the more iron produced.
    Before the 15th, the Iron Smelting Plant held a "competition" meeting, where heroes took the stage one after another to compare their determination, compare their drive, compare their methods, and compare their communist style. Everyone proposed that everyone should guard their post, accumulate small victories into big victories, and, under the existing conditions, leap the daily output of pig iron to more than 2,200 tons. On the 15th, in 24 hours, a total of 2,214 tons of iron were produced, 400 to 500 tons more than usual.

    武钢一号高炉大跃进
    日产量曾超过设计指标
    据长江日报消息　武钢的“大洋群”运动已经在一号高炉领先开展起来。11月15日，武钢一号高炉日产生铁二千二百一十四吨，超过设计指标一百四十四吨。
    近来，炼铁厂职工为高炉高产展开了一场大鸣大放大辩论。两三天中，职工们贴出了一千七百多张大字报，对管理工作等方面的缺点提出批评，对如何高产提出建议。大字报贴出来以后，还开展了辩论。有些技术员害怕料下快了、风量大了会出事故；工人们认为不能只是消极害怕，应该积极想办法增产。有些工人还举出过去鞍山敢说、敢干的增产事例，说服了少数技术人员。同时，工人对自己操作不注意，出现几次铁水流到外面等事故进行了自我批评。
    辩论以后，炼铁厂立刻出现了新气象，开始实行两参一改，领导干部经常在炉前操作。技术人员和工人融洽了，三班工人团结了，领导干部和技术人员事事找工人商量。全厂出现了一种敢想、敢说、敢作的新风格。现在一号高炉开始用世界最先进的高压炉顶进行操作，高压越大、热量就大、出铁就多。
    15日以前，炼铁厂举行了“比武”大会，英雄们个个上台比决心、比干劲、比方法、比共产主义风格。大家提出要人人把关口，集小胜为大胜，在现有的条件下，把生铁日产量跃到二千二百吨以上。15日在二十四小时内，共出铁二千二百一十四吨，比平时多产四、五百吨。
