    My Mom, "Fragrant Village"
    Ying Xuan, Dongli Township, Yiyuan County, Shandong
    Not long after the establishment of the People's Commune, various production teams began to set up public canteens. As Dad expected, Mom was indeed chosen by everyone to be in charge of the kitchen. After breakfast, Mom busied herself changing clothes, preparing to go to the canteen. Dad stroked his beard and said to Mom, "Tsk! My old partner, this time it's not just the reputation of 'Fragrant Village' forcing us to go to the Northeast!" He chuckled as he said this.
    Mom is a well-known cook in the whole village. Rice, flour, grains, chicken, fish, meat, eggs, sweet potato vermicelli, all rural dishes, once they pass through her hands, are made exceptionally delicious. Whenever someone in the village has a happy occasion, they always ask her to help with the cooking. Everyone praises Mom's cooking for being able to fill the whole village with fragrance, so they gave Mom the nickname "Fragrant Village."
    I asked Mom what Dad meant by going to the Northeast.
    Mom, changing clothes, sighed and said, "At that time, your dad and I were farming for the landlord 'Black Miser.' One day, 'Black Miser' staggered into our house, drunk, and said, 'Fragrant Village, my house is missing someone to cook and prepare meals, come to my house and serve me, earn some leftover oil and food scraps to eat, it's better than your poor life!' Bah! A landlord with a belly full of poison! Even if a knife is pressed against my neck, don't even think about me entering your dark prison! And don't even think about eating the food I cook! There was really no other way, so we had to abandon our home and property, and secretly went to the Northeast with your dad the next night! It wasn't until liberation that we came back home! At that time, you had just turned one year old!" As Mom spoke, she changed into a newly sewn sky-blue dress, and on the white apron tied around her waist, there was also the bright red lettering "Dongli People's Commune Seventh Canteen!"
    Second Uncle Hongen moved into the new red-tiled houses built in the commune, and the canteen was set up in his original home. Five chimneys were newly built on the roof, towering high, and the walls were also plastered smooth and white. Five brand-new red-tiled and black-bricked dining halls were located in the middle of the courtyard, and the glass windows and rows of dining tables reflected people's images.
    After school in the afternoon, I walked to the canteen door, and a burst of laughter came from inside. I heard Third Aunt shout at the top of her voice, "The Party Secretary said: 'Those who are able should work harder!' Everyone unanimously elected you to manage the cooking stove and be a master chef, and us clumsy sisters will follow along and do odd jobs. Isn't that right?"
    "Sharp-tongued woman, I don't need you to be glib! Hmm, managing the eating and drinking of hundreds of people, the power is not small! Let me tell you, it's not just 'Fragrant Village,' we also want to fill the whole commune with fragrance!" I heard, this was Mom's voice.
    I had been home for a while when Mom also came back in a hurry; while rolling up her sleeves and lifting her apron, she said to me, "Zhu, come quickly! The flour mill sent flour to our canteen, and the canteen is short of a flour vat. The people delivering the flour are in a hurry to leave, come quickly! Help Mom carry our vat to the canteen to store the flour."
    In the first few months after the establishment of the People's Commune, the original small cooperative used to make urine fertilizer, and the cooperative director discussed with Mom three times, wanting to buy our vat for seven yuan. At that time, Mom thought the price was too low and refused to sell it no matter what. At this time, I couldn't help but ask, "Mom, how much has the price of the vat increased this time?"
    Mom blushed, and while tidying up the vat, she said to me angrily, "Don't be so talkative, the canteen needs it urgently, carry it away quickly!"
    The vat was carried to the canteen, and the accountant counted eight yuan and gave it to Mom. Mom pulled a long face, didn't even look at the eight yuan, and said angrily, "What? Do you think your sister-in-law is a selfish ghost? Didn't I say it over and over again just now that this is a little something from me for our canteen! Look at you! You're only hung up on a few stinky coins! Go where you need to go, everyone will be eating dinner tonight, and I'm still busy!" Saying this, Mom strode towards the stove, and I also ran two steps to catch up, to see if I could lend a hand to help Mom. (Attached picture)

### 我的妈妈“香满庄”
应选

    我的妈妈“香满庄”
    山东沂源县东里乡　应选
    人民公社成立不久，各个连队开始建立公共食堂。不出爸爸所料，妈果然被大伙选为“伙头军”。早饭后，妈忙着换衣裳，准备往食堂去。爸爸捋着胡楂儿，对妈说：“啧！我的老伙计，这回可不是‘香满庄’的名声儿，逼着咱下关东呀！”说着，呵呵笑了。
    妈是全村出名的厨手，米面杂粮，鸡鱼肉蛋，地瓜粉皮，农村所有饭菜，一经她手，做的格外可口好吃。村里谁家有个喜事，总是请她来帮忙做菜。大伙都夸妈做的饭菜能香满庄，所以给妈起了个外号叫“香满庄”。
    我问妈，爸爸讲的下关东是怎么回事？
    妈换着衣服，叹了口气，说：“那工夫，我和你爸爸给地主‘黑财迷’种地。一天，‘黑财迷’醉醺醺地闯进咱家，说：‘香满庄，我家大门里缺个办饭做菜的，你到我家侍候侍候吧，赚点剩油剩菜儿吃，总比你这穷日子强啊！’呸！一肚子毒水的地主！就是刀按脖子，也休想我进你家的黑牢门！也休想吃我做的饭菜！实在没法儿了，只得抛家荡产，第二天夜里，和你爸爸偷偷地下了关东！一直到解放，咱才家来呀！那工夫，你刚满周岁哩！”妈说着，换上一身新缝的天蓝色衣裳，腰间系着的白色围裙上，还缀着“东里人民公社第七食堂”的鲜红大字哩！
    洪恩二叔搬到社里新盖的那一片红色大瓦房里去了，食堂就设在他原来的家里。屋顶上新砌五个烟囱，老高老高的耸立着，墙壁也粉刷的光溜白。五间崭新的红瓦黑砖大饭厅，座落在庭院中间，玻璃窗户和饭桌一排排的照得见人影儿。
    放午学，我走到食堂门前，里面传出一片说笑声。只听三婶子拉开嗓门儿说：“党委书记说过：能者多劳嘛！大伙儿公推你掌管锅灶，当个大师傅，俺这些笨手笨脚的姐妹儿跟着打打杂。不是么？”
    “尖嘴婆娘，不用你耍滑嘴儿！嗯，管着几百号人吃喝，权柄就是不小嘛！告诉你说，不光香满庄，咱还要香满社哩！”我听着，这是妈的声音。
    我到家一会儿，妈也急冲冲地回来；她一边卷着衣袖儿，撩起围裙，对我说：“柱呀，快来！面粉厂给咱食堂送来面，食堂缺一口面缸，人家送面的急着走，快来！帮着妈抬咱家这口缸到食堂去，把面盛下。”
    人民公社成立的前几个月，原来的小社沤尿肥，社主任和妈商议三次，要作价七元收买咱家这口缸使用。那时，妈嫌价格低，说啥也不卖。这时，我不禁问道：“妈，这回缸价涨了多少呀？”
    妈脸一红，一边拾掇缸，一边对我气乎乎地说：“别多嘴多舌的，食堂急着用，快抬走！”
    缸儿抬到食堂，会计数着八元钱送给妈，妈把脸一板，看也不看那八元钱，气乎乎地说：“怎么？你就看定你嫂子我是个自私鬼么？我刚才不是说了个三番五次，这是我对咱食堂的一点儿心意嘛！看你呗！只在几个臭钱上吃紧！该到那儿快到那儿去吧，晚上大伙儿开饭，我还忙着哩！说着，妈大步往锅灶边走去，我也跑了两步跟上去，看能不能插上手给妈帮帮忙。（附图片）
