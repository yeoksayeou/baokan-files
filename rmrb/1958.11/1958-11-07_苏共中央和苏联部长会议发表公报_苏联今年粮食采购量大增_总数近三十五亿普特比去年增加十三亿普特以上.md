Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th (TASS dispatch): The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR stated in a communiqué that the collective farms and state farms of the Soviet Union have delivered a total of 3,491 million poods (each pood equals 32.76 jin) of grain to the state from this year's harvest, which is 1,329 million poods more than the state procured last year. This material shows that this year's Soviet grain procurement is more than 100 million poods more than the unprecedented bumper harvest of 1956.

The communiqué emphasized that due to the reclamation of wasteland, the eastern region of the Soviet Union has become the largest base for grain production in the Soviet Union. This year, 2 billion poods of grain were purchased in the reclaimed areas, while only 652 million poods were purchased in 1953 before the reclamation. In the five years from 1954 to 1958, more than 4 billion poods of grain were purchased in the eastern reclaimed areas than in the previous five years.

The communiqué said that the collective farms and state farms of the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine have achieved great success. As of November 1st, they had delivered 1.93 billion poods, 950 million poods, and 552.2 million poods of grain to the state, respectively.

This year, the state's sugar beet procurement plan has been completed by 111%. As of November 1st, the collective farms and state farms across the country have delivered 43 million tons of sugar beet to the state, which is 6.7 million tons more than the unprecedented bumper harvest of the same period in 1957.

As of November 1st, the collective farms and state farms have delivered 3,211,000 tons of seed cotton to the state this year, and the cotton harvesting work is still continuing.

In discussing the achievements in the development of animal husbandry, the communiqué pointed out that in the year from October 1st of last year to October 1st of this year, the number of cattle in the Soviet Union increased by 3.5 million head, pigs increased by 1.5 million head, and sheep and goats increased by 6.4 million head.

The communiqué said that this year's corn harvest in the Soviet Union was also very good. The collective farms and state farms across the country harvested nearly 145 million tons of silage, an increase of 57 million tons over the past. The harvest of coarse feed increased by 7.7 million tons compared with last year.

The communiqué pointed out that after the reorganization of machine tractor stations, the state has sold 463,000 tractors, 200,400 grain harvesting combines, 58,000 corn and silage harvesting combines, and hundreds of thousands of other agricultural machines to the collective farms.
