    Messages Left After Visiting the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    We are very happy to have seen the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region people lively and vigorous, with soaring enthusiasm; to have seen the friendship and unity between the various ethnic groups; and to have seen the vigorous development of construction. This is the glorious victory of the Party's leadership, the glorious victory of the Party's correct ethnic policies.

    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has fertile land and abundant resources. We believe that the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, on the basis of the victories already achieved, following the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, will strive unremittingly and will surely achieve greater success in developing agriculture, industry, animal husbandry, and sand control and greening. Building the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region even better will surely make a huge contribution to the socialist construction of our great motherland.
