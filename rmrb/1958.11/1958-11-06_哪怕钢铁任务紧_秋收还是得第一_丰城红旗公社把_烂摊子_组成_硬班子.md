Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 4th. Reporter Li Jiuzhe reports: The Hongqi Commune Party Committee in Fengcheng County, Jiangxi, has strengthened its leadership in autumn harvesting and winter planting, turning what was called a mess on the agricultural front into a tough team, completing the autumn harvest and winter planting quickly and well.

The Hongqi Commune has a total labor force of 24,000 (converted from male, female, full, and half), but 11,000 of the full labor force have been drawn to engage in steel production and water conservancy construction, leaving mostly women and the elderly at home. The commune's autumn harvest and winter planting tasks are larger than in previous years, with an autumn harvest area of ​​68,700 mu and a winter planting area of ​​135,000 mu; a total of 243,344 workdays are needed, while the labor force remaining at home can only provide 121,364 workdays, a difference of more than half.

Under these circumstances, the cadres and masses left at home were ideologically confused. The cadres believed that agriculture was a "mess" and had no confidence in completing the tasks. Some of the masses waited passively, thinking that the higher authorities would come up with a solution when the time came, "the tall ones will hold up the sky when it falls, so we don't need to worry;" others doubted the large-scale steel production, thinking that steel production would affect agriculture.

The Commune Party Committee believed that in order to complete the autumn harvest and winter planting, the ideological problem must be solved first, so they led everyone to conduct a free airing of views and debates. It was clarified that: 1. As long as the Party's leadership is strengthened, and ideological and organizational work is strengthened, the current mess on the agricultural front can be completely transformed into a tough team. 2. Mobilize the masses widely, everyone shares the difficulties, and everyone holds up the sky when it falls. 3. Steel production must be carried out, not only this year, but also next year. Therefore, we must organize the current mess in agriculture into a fighting force to ensure that agricultural production is done well while steel production is also done well.

After the ideology was clarified, the Commune Party Committee led the masses to tap the labor potential. First, all 6,500 female laborers at home were mobilized to participate in the autumn harvest and winter planting. Second, more than 3,000 children over the age of ten in the commune, some on vacation and some with reduced class time, participated in some labor. Third, the elderly were organized to participate in labor within their capabilities. In addition, 877 people were drawn from the 585 public canteens in the commune to engage in production, and main laborers were exchanged for secondary laborers; the establishment of nurseries and laundry groups liberated another 1,458 female laborers; residents and handicraft workers in four market towns, totaling 3,000 people, were mobilized to participate in the autumn harvest. Of the 9,000 laborers engaged in steel production in the commune, more than 2,000 transported charcoal near the commune, and their spare time was also used to help the commune with autumn harvest and winter planting.

After the labor force was tapped, the next step was to carry out organization and management work. First, the work was divided according to physical strength and skills. The old, weak, and children picked cotton, pulled sesame, accumulated fertilizer, and cut rice, while male laborers and strong women cut rice, transported fertilizer, and planted seeds. Second, new organizations were established, mainly referring to the residents of market towns, children, and the group of people engaged in steel transportation. People in market towns formed autumn harvest and winter planting companies or platoons independently, with the market town as the unit. Because they were not skilled, agricultural production teams sent people to serve as technical instructors. Children formed children's battalions and companies under the leadership of school class meetings. The 2,000 people transporting charcoal for steel production near the commune were contacted by the commune and the county's steel headquarters. According to their charcoal transportation routes, they were concentrated in four late rice growing areas and commanded by the original organization. Third, all kinds of autumn harvest and winter planting organizations universally implemented "three-izations" (militarization, combat-ization, and discipline-ization) and "four-fixings" (fix tasks, fix labor, fix time, and fix quality) to improve labor efficiency, save labor, and ensure the quality of harvesting and planting.

After being organized, it was also necessary to persist in ideological work. The method was to debate problems at any time and stipulate a "theoretical study day" (every three days). On the "theoretical study day," meetings were held in the evenings by the various levels of militarized organizations to discuss ideology, how industry and agriculture could leap forward together, and to carry out criticism and praise.

After such meticulous ideological and organizational work, this tough team has completely completed the commune's harvesting tasks. The speed and quality are the best in the county. The planting tasks have also been completed well and are also upstream. They are now working hard to complete the winter planting tasks and are determined to do a good job in deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and other tasks to prepare for next year's production.

### 哪怕钢铁任务紧  秋收还是得第一  丰城红旗公社把“烂摊子”组成“硬班子”

    哪怕钢铁任务紧
    秋收还是得第一
    丰城红旗公社把“烂摊子”组成“硬班子”
    新华社南昌4日电　记者李久泽报道：江西丰城县红旗公社党委加强秋收冬种的领导，把农业战线上的所谓烂摊子组织成了硬班子，秋收冬种完成得又快又好。
    红旗公社共有劳动力（男、女、整、半折合）二万四千个，但其中整劳动力一万一千个都抽去搞钢铁生产和修水利去了，留在家中的多是妇女和老弱。全社秋收冬种任务比往年大，秋收面积六万八千七百亩，冬种面积十三万五千亩；共需二十四万三千三百四十四个劳动日，而留在家中的劳动力只能提供十二万一千三百六十四个劳动日，相差一半多。
    在这种情况下，留在家里的干部和群众，思想都比较混乱。干部认为农业上是个“烂摊子”，对完成任务没有信心。群众有的消极等待，认为到时候上面会想办法，“天塌下来有高个子顶住，不用我们发愁”；有的对大搞钢铁产生了怀疑，认为搞钢铁影响农业。
    公社党委认为要完成秋收 冬种，首先得解决思想问题，于是领导大家进行了鸣放辩论。明确了：一、只要加强党的领导，加强思想工作和组织工作，农业战线上现在这个烂摊子完全可以变成一个硬班子。二、广泛发动群众，困难大家挡，天塌下来大家顶住。三、钢铁要搞，不仅今年，明年还是要搞。因此，必须把现在农业上的这个烂摊子组织成一支战斗力量，以保证在搞好钢铁的同时搞好农业生产。
    思想明确以后，公社党委便领导群众把劳动潜力挖掘出来。第一、把家里的六千五百名妇女劳动力都动员起来投入了秋收冬种。第二、全社三千多个十岁以上的儿童，有的放假，有的减少上课时间，参加部分劳动。第三、把老年人组织起来参加他们力所能及的劳动。此外，从全社五百八十五个公共食堂中抽出了八百七十七人搞生产，并且以次要劳力换出了主要劳力；健全与建立了托儿所、洗衣组，从中又解放出了一千四百五十八个妇女劳动力；动员了四个墟镇居民、手工业者，共三千人参加秋收。全社九千个搞钢铁的劳动力中有二千多人在公社附近运送木炭，他们的间隙时间也被利用起来为社里搞秋收冬种。
    劳力挖出来后，接着就进行组织和管理工作。第一、按照体力及技术进行分工，老的弱的和儿童，摘棉花、扯芝麻、积肥、割禾，男劳动力及强壮妇女割禾、送肥、播种。第二、建立新的组织，主要是指墟镇居民、儿童和搞钢铁运输的三部分人。墟镇的人以墟镇为单位单独成立秋收冬种连或排，技术不熟练，由农业生产队派人任技术指导。儿童以学校的班会为领导，专门成立儿童营连。在公社附近给钢铁生产运木炭的二千人，公社与县的钢铁指挥部取得联系，根据他们运木炭的路线，分别集中在四个晚稻多的作业区，由原组织指挥。第三、各种秋收冬种组织普遍实行“三化”（军事化、战斗化、纪律化）、“四定”（定任务、定劳力、定时间、定质量），以提高劳动效率，节省劳动力，保证收种质量。
    组织起来以后还需要坚持思想工作，办法是：有问题随时辩论，并规定“务虚日”（三天一务）。“务虚日”这天晚上以各级军事化组织为单位开会谈思想，谈工业、农业如何齐跃进，并进行批评表扬。
    经过这样细致的思想工作和组织工作，这个硬班子已经全部完成了全社的收割任务，速度和质量是全县第一，种的任务完成也好，也是上游。现在他们正在加油完成冬种任务，并决意把深耕、积肥等项工作都做好，为明年生产做好准备。
