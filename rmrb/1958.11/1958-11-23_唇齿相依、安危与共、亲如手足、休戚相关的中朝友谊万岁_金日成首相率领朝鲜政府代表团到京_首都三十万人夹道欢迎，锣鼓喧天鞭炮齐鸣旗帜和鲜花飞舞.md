Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. Premier Kim Il-sung led the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to Beijing this morning. Premier Zhou Enlai and central leaders in Beijing welcomed the distinguished Korean guests at the station. Three hundred thousand people from all walks of life in the capital cheered the arrival of the distinguished guests.

The presence of Comrade Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people, and the Korean government delegation, along with all comrades of the military delegation headed by General Kim Kwang-hyup, brought unparalleled joy to the people of the capital, as if celebrating a grand festival. The deep fraternal affection of the Chinese and Korean people, who share life and death, shone even more brilliantly throughout Beijing today.

Today, in the capital of our great motherland, countless national flags of China and Korea and colorful banners fluttered in the warm early winter sunshine. Huge slogans in gold lettering on a red background, such as "Long Live the Friendship Between the Chinese and Korean People!" "Long Live the Great Socialist Camp Headed by the Soviet Union!" "Long Live World Peace!" radiated dazzling light everywhere. The welcoming masses, holding flowers and colorful flags, gathered from early morning towards Beijing Railway Station, Tiananmen Square, and the broad streets, forming a magnificent and joyous torrent there. Today, the people of the capital, with boundless excitement, welcomed the glorious envoys of the heroic Korean people, cheered the leaping development of socialist construction in Korea, and applauded the immortal contributions made to the defense of peace.

At 11:00 a.m., when the special train carrying the distinguished guests from our close neighbor slowly entered Beijing Railway Station, Premier Zhou Enlai and all the central leaders applauded to the tune of joyous friendship music. On the colorfully decorated platform, tens of thousands of welcoming masses raised the national flags of both countries, waved their colorful bouquets, and shouted in unison: "Welcome, Comrade Kim Il-sung, the close friend of the Chinese people!"

When Premier Kim Il-sung and all the distinguished Korean guests stepped off the train, they were warmly welcomed by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai, He Long, Chen Yi, and Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, and Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, and Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee Wang Jiaxiang.

Dozens of lively and lovely Young Pioneers presented flowers to Premier Kim Il-sung and all the distinguished Korean guests. When Premier Kim Il-sung, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the guard of honor, the Premier greeted the members of the guard of honor in fluent Chinese: "Greetings, Comrades!" The members of the guard of honor shouted in unison: "Greetings, Premier!"

Premier Kim Il-sung, amidst waves of thunderous applause and countless excited and joyous faces in the welcoming crowd, conveyed the love and friendship of the Korean people for Beijing and all the Chinese people in his speech at Beijing Railway Station. Premier Kim Il-sung said that through the arduous revolutionary struggle against foreign imperialism, the traditional friendly relations between the Korean and Chinese people have been further consolidated and have entered a new and higher stage. He praised with great excitement that the friendly unity of the two countries has made significant contributions to the prosperity and development of both countries and to peace in the Far East and the world, and pointed out that it will make even greater contributions in the future.

Premier Kim Il-sung praised the Chinese people in the most beautiful terms for "completing the great historical undertaking that could not be completed in the past thousands of years in just a few years, and creating great miracles that amaze people all over the world." In his speech, he also warmly declared that the Korean people will do their utmost to further strengthen the militant friendship with the Chinese people.

The welcoming crowd listened to Premier Kim Il-sung's speech with respect and gratitude. Every sentence of his speech was followed by continuous applause on the platform. People warmly cheered the beloved leader and envoys of the Korean people, applauding the heroic Korean people's great contributions to Sino-Korean friendship and the defense of world peace, standing at the forefront of peace in the East.

Before Premier Kim Il-sung's speech, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government and the people of the whole country, warmly welcomed the leader of the Korean people and all the distinguished Korean guests. In his speech, Premier Zhou praised the friendly relations between China and Korea as "close as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe," and praised the friendship between the two peoples as "as intimate as brothers, sharing happiness and suffering." He said that the people of China and Korea are not only comrades-in-arms in the struggle against imperialist aggression, but also brothers who support each other and learn from each other in peaceful construction. Premier Zhou firmly declared: "The friendly unity of our two countries in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union cannot be destroyed by any force in the world."

Premier Zhou warmly praised the Korean people for their spirit of hard work under the leadership of the Labor Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, and for the great achievements they have made in construction, and wished Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean comrades that this visit will promote the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.

After the Premier and Prime Minister finished their speeches, they shook hands warmly and expressed their cordial greetings. At this time, the warm current of friendship warmed everyone's heart, and the applause and cheers that resounded through the sky vibrated once again over Beijing Railway Station.

In the long welcoming line on the station platform were also the heads of various departments of the central state organs, people's organizations, and democratic parties. Among them, many were old comrades-in-arms of Comrade Kim Il-sung during the years when he led the Korean people to participate in the Chinese revolutionary struggle, and many had forged deep friendships with the Korean people in the past in Korea. Today, they all came to welcome the distinguished guests with boundless gratitude to the Korean people and with nostalgia for the old combat friendship.

General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping excitedly shook hands and greeted Premier Kim Il-sung and all the distinguished guests of the delegation one by one at the station. More than twenty days ago, they returned to their motherland, which they had been away from for eight years, with reluctance and reluctance, under the warm farewell of the whole of Korea. Today, they are welcoming these close comrades-in-arms who once fought side by side on the Korean battlefield and jointly defended the socialist eastern outpost in the capital of their motherland, feeling particularly excited and cordial. General Wang Ping was so excited in the middle of the night yesterday that he found the newest clothes for his two daughters and told them how to scatter flowers to Premier Kim Il-sung and the distinguished guests of the delegation. The arrival of the distinguished guests made General Yang Yong, General Wang Ping, and others unable to help but immerse themselves in memories of the past. During the summer counterattack in 1953, when General Yang Yong commanded a certain unit of the Volunteer Army to capture an unnamed highland on the east bank of the North Han River, the Korean People's Army used powerful artillery fire to cooperate in bombing the enemy on this unnamed highland, supporting the Volunteer Army to quickly capture this position. After the armistice, one time two trains of the Volunteer Army were trapped by blizzards on the road, and hunger and severe cold seriously threatened the officers and soldiers on the trains. At that time, the People's Army immediately dispatched aircraft to airdrop food to the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army, and nearby officers and soldiers of the People's Army and the Korean people transported food and removed snow for the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army, quickly freeing the officers and soldiers on these two trains from danger. On the days of the Volunteer Army's return to China, the Korean party and government leaders headed by Premier Kim Il-sung personally went to the Volunteer Army units to say goodbye. When the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army headquarters left Pyongyang to return to China, Premier Kim Il-sung arrived at the station half an hour earlier to cordially send them off. After recalling these facts, General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping said with great excitement: It was precisely because of the meticulous care and support of the Korean Labor Party, the Republic Government, and the Korean people, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army defeated the enemy and won victory on the Korean battlefield.

Countless flower petals and colorful ribbons were thrown up among the welcoming crowds at the station. The music and singing of "Song of General Kim Il-sung" rose one after another. Thousands of people on both sides of the platform applauded and cheered enthusiastically, crowding around Premier Kim Il-sung and all the distinguished Korean guests as they walked out of the station. Premier Kim Il-sung, covered in flower petals, was accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and boarded an open-top car. Comrades Park Jung-ai, Nam Il, Kim Kwang-hyup, Lee Il-kyung, and Lee Yong-ho were also accompanied by comrades Peng Dehuai, Chen Yi, Zhang Wentian, etc., and boarded open-top cars, slowly driving towards the guesthouse. On the ancient arrow tower, a large banner reading "Welcome Premier Kim Il-sung" was hung high under the red flag fluttering in the wind. Opposite the station square stood a huge colored oil painting. Two heroic soldiers from China and Korea stood side by side in the picture. Behind them were pines and cypresses symbolizing the eternal friendship between China and Korea. Two doves of peace soaring between the pines and cypresses. Below the oil painting were dazzling white characters on a red background: "Long Live the Militant Friendship Forged with Blood by the People of China and Korea!"

On the streets, which were covered with huge welcome slogans and fluttering colorful flags, the 300,000 welcoming crowds were boiling. Wherever the open-top cars of Premier Kim Il-sung and other distinguished Korean guests arrived, a climax of joy appeared. Drums and gongs were played loudly, firecrackers were set off, and banners and flowers flew all over the sky. Premier Kim Il-sung's head, body, and car were covered with flower petals and colored paper. Everywhere the distinguished guests' cars passed, there were piles of flower petals and colorful ribbons all over the ground. The walls of many houses, the rooftop platforms of many tall buildings, and the windows were also crowded with people, warmly applauding and welcoming the distinguished guests. On Tiananmen Square, where a huge construction project was underway, countless construction workers climbed onto the piles of wood and sand piles that filled the square, waved their hands, and shouted welcome slogans, welcoming the envoys of friendship from the Korean people, who were rapidly carrying out large-scale socialist construction. Along the way, Premier Kim Il-sung always smiled, chatting cordially with Premier Zhou Enlai from time to time, and frequently waving to the welcoming crowd.

In the welcoming crowd were workers who had just got off work and had no time to rest, farmers from the suburbs, shop assistants who had walked out of the counter, enthusiastic university and middle school students, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and fully armed militiamen, white-haired old people and housewives holding children. From the station to the guesthouse, people sang and danced, enthusiastically and unrestrainedly, and there were touching scenes everywhere.

The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company got off the night shift, washed their faces, changed their clothes, and rushed from forty miles away to welcome the distinguished guests. The workers said excitedly: "We welcome Premier Kim Il-sung to visit!" Dai Hongbin, the head of the wooden mold section of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, was full of enthusiasm, constantly applauding and cheering in the welcoming crowd, and excitedly telling his partners about his experiences in Korea. Three years ago, when he first arrived in Pyongyang, some streets were still covered with rubble, but in less than two months, buildings had sprung up everywhere. Dai Hongbin said: "I will never forget the scene of Korean workers working selflessly day and night. Recently, the workers of the New Uiju Paradise Factory wrote me a letter, knowing that they are striding forward on the Chollima. I believe that under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung, the construction speed of the Korean people will surely leap forward." The 3,000 militiamen of the Capital Militia Division were neatly arranged on the station square today, welcoming the Korean government delegation headed by Premier Kim Il-sung. They were fully armed, in high spirits, and their cheers and slogans were particularly loud. Zhao De, the deputy commander of the militia division, said to the militiamen of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory: "The heroic spirit of the Korean people in defending their country and homeland is a model for us to learn from. If American imperialism dares to launch a war, we will once again puncture this paper tiger."

Zhao Guirong, an old lady living in Yangrou Hutong, Xisi, rushed to Tiananmen Square early this morning. Eight years ago, when the flames of war of American imperialism burned to the Yalu River, she sent her son to join the Volunteer Army to aid the fraternal Korean people. Now her son has returned to the motherland. Today she is particularly happy to welcome the Korean distinguished guests. She said: "Korea and China are good brothers and will never be separated. American imperialism is still clinging to South Korea and refusing to leave. They will be driven out by the Korean people sooner or later!"

In the enthusiastic welcoming crowd were Wang Huyuan, Lu Changrong, and Wang Zhanshan, heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and Huang Zhifu, who was praised by the Korean people as "Living Luo Shengjiao." All of them had seen Premier Kim Il-sung in Korea. The Premier had kindly encouraged them. The honor given to them by the Premier became a force to encourage them to move forward. When they read in the newspaper that Premier Kim Il-sung was going to lead a government delegation to visit our country, they looked forward to it day and night. Some people even met Premier Kim Il-sung in their dreams, and also dreamed of the Korean people and People's Army comrades who supported and cared for them like parents and brothers. Today, they came to welcome the Korean distinguished guests with infinite gratitude. When Premier Kim Il-sung and others passed by them, they clapped non-stop and shouted welcome slogans as loudly as they could.

The wave of joy was higher than the last, and the passion of friendship always infected everyone's heart. Until the cars carrying Premier Kim Il-sung and other distinguished Korean guests drove into the guesthouse, the welcoming crowd was still cheering outside the door, reluctant to leave for a long time.

Today, all the distinguished Korean guests headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, accompanied by Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, Chinese Ambassador to Korea Qiao Xiaoguang, and others, arrived in Beijing from Andong. All the members of the Korean Embassy in China, all the artists of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Art Troupe, Korean students in Beijing, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China, all went to Beijing Railway Station to welcome the distinguished guests.

    唇齿相依、安危与共、亲如手足、休戚相关的中朝友谊万岁
    金日成首相率领朝鲜政府代表团到京
    首都三十万人夹道欢迎，锣鼓喧天鞭炮齐鸣旗帜和鲜花飞舞
    新华社22日讯　金日成首相率领的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团今天上午到达北京。周恩来总理和在北京的中央领导同志都到车站迎接朝鲜贵宾，首都工农商学兵各界人民三十万人夹道欢呼贵宾们的到来。
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成同志和朝鲜政府代表团与以金光侠大将为首的军事代表团全体同志的光临，给首都人民带来了庆祝盛大节日一般的无比欢乐。中朝两国人民同生死共患难的手足深情，今天在整个北京城发出了更加灿烂的光辉。
    今天，在我们伟大祖国的首都，数不尽的中朝两国国旗和彩旗在初冬的和暖阳光中迎风招展，“中朝人民的友谊万岁！”“以苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”等巨幅红底金字标语，到处放射着耀眼的光彩。手执鲜花、彩旗的欢迎群众，从清晨就向北京车站、天安门广场和广阔的马路上汇集，在那里组成了波澜壮阔的欢乐洪流。首都人民今天怀着无比激动的心情迎接英雄朝鲜人民的光荣使者，欢呼朝鲜人民社会主义建设的飞跃发展和对保卫和平立下的不朽功勋。
    上午十一时，当来自我们亲密邻邦的贵宾乘坐的专车徐徐驶进北京车站的时候，周恩来总理和中央的所有领导同志都和着欢乐的友谊乐曲在鼓掌，在装饰得五彩缤纷的车站月台上，成千上万的欢迎群众举起了手里的两国国旗，挥舞着手里绚丽的花束，发出了共同的欢呼：“欢迎你，中国人民亲密的朋友金日成同志！”
    金日成首相和全体朝鲜贵宾步下火车时，受到了周恩来总理，彭德怀、贺龙、陈毅、聂荣臻副总理，李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、程潜副委员长，国防委员会张治中副主席，政协李四光副主席，外交部张闻天副部长，中共中央书记处书记王稼祥等人的热烈欢迎。
    几十名活泼可爱的少先队员向金日成首相和全体朝鲜贵宾献了鲜花。在金日成首相由周恩来总理陪同检阅仪仗队时，首相用流利的中国话向全体仪仗队队员高声道贺：“祝同志们好！”全体仪仗队员齐声高呼：“首相同志好！”
    金日成首相迎着一阵阵春雷般的掌声和欢迎群众中无数兴奋激动的笑脸，在北京车站的讲话中转达了朝鲜人民对北京和全中国人民的热爱和友谊。金日成首相说，通过反对外来帝国主义的艰苦的革命斗争的考验，朝中两国人民的传统友好关系已经得到了进一步巩固，并且进入了更新、更高的阶段，他怀着极大的兴奋心情称颂了两国的友好团结已经对两国的繁荣发展和远东与世界和平作出了重大贡献，并且指出今后还将作出更大的贡献。
    金日成首相以最美好的词句赞扬中国人民在短短的几年时间内“完成了过去几千年来没能完成的历史性的伟大事业，创造着使全世界的人们都感到惊异的伟大奇迹”。他在讲话中还热情地宣称朝鲜人民将竭力进一步加强同中国人民的战斗友谊。
    欢迎人群怀着崇敬和感激的心情静听着金日成首相的讲话。他的每一段讲话的话音未落，月台上就响起了持续不断的掌声。人们向着朝鲜人民的敬爱领袖和使者们热烈欢呼，欢呼站在东方和平前哨的英雄朝鲜人民对中朝友谊和保卫世界和平的伟大贡献。
    在金日成首相讲话以前，周恩来总理代表中国政府和全国人民热情地致词欢迎朝鲜人民的领袖和全体朝鲜贵宾。周总理在讲话中颂扬中朝两国的友好关系是“唇齿相依，安危与共”，赞颂两国人民的友情是“亲如手足，休戚相关”。他说中朝两国人民不仅是反对帝国主义侵略斗争中的战友，并且在和平建设中也是互相支援互相学习的兄弟。周总理坚定地宣称：“我们两国在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的友好团结，是世界上任何力量也破坏不了的。”
    周总理热情地称颂了朝鲜人民在劳动党和金日成首相的领导下的苦干精神和他们在建设事业中所取得的巨大成就，并且预祝金日成首相和朝鲜同志们的这次访问将促进两国友好合作关系的进一步发展。
    首相和总理结束讲话以后，他们热烈地握手，亲切致意。这时，友谊的热流温暖了每一个人的心，响彻云霄的掌声和欢呼声再一次振荡在北京车站的上空。
    在车站月台上漫长的欢迎队伍里还有中央国家机关各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派的负责人。在他们当中，有许多人是在金日成同志当年领导朝鲜人民参加中国革命斗争时期的老战友，有许多人过去在朝鲜同朝鲜人民结下了深厚的友谊。他们今天都怀着对朝鲜人民的无比感激心情和对旧日战斗友情的怀念，前来欢迎贵宾们。
    杨勇上将和王平上将在车站上激动地同金日成首相和代表团的全体贵宾一一握手、问候。二十多天前，他们在朝鲜举国上下盛情欢送下，怀着依依不舍、难分难离的心情回到了阔别八年的祖国，今天，他们在自己祖国的首都欢迎这些曾经在朝鲜战场上并肩作战、共同守卫了社会主义东方前哨的亲密战友，感到分外的兴奋和亲切。王平上将在昨天深夜里，就兴奋地给两个女儿找出了最新的衣服，告诉女儿怎样向金日成首相和代表团的贵宾们撒花。贵宾们的到来，使杨勇上将、王平上将等情不自禁地沉浸在对往事的回忆里。1953年夏季反击战中，杨勇上将指挥志愿军某部攻占北汉江东岸敌人的一个无名高地时，朝鲜人民军用强大的炮火配合轰击这个无名高地上的敌人，支援志愿军迅速攻占了这个阵地。停战后，有一次志愿军的两列列车被暴风雪困阻在半路上，饥饿和严寒严重威胁着列车上的官兵们，当时，人民军立即出动了飞机，为志愿军官兵们空投食物，附近的人民军官兵和朝鲜人民纷纷为志愿军官兵们运送粮食和挖除积雪，迅速使这两列列车上的官兵们脱离了险境。在志愿军归国的日子里，以金日成首相为首的朝鲜党政领导人亲自到志愿军部队送别，在志愿军总部官兵离开平壤归国时，金日成首相提前半个钟头赶到车站上，亲切地为官兵们送行。杨勇上将、王平上将回忆起这些事实以后，万分激动地说：正是由于以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和朝鲜人民无微不至的关怀和支援，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上才打败了敌人、取得了胜利。
    车站上的欢迎群众中抛起了无数的鲜花花瓣和各色彩带，“金日成将军之歌”的乐曲声和歌声此起彼伏，月台两旁千万人热烈鼓掌欢呼，簇拥着金日成首相和全体朝鲜贵宾步出车站。金日成首相全身披满鲜花花瓣，由周恩来总理陪同登上敞篷汽车。朴正爱同志、南日同志、金光侠同志、李一卿同志和李永镐同志，也分别由彭德怀、陈毅、张闻天等同志陪同，乘上敞篷汽车，徐徐驶向迎宾馆。在古老的箭楼上，迎风招展的红旗下面高悬着“欢迎金日成首相”的大幅标语。车站广场的对面矗立着一幅巨大的彩色油画，中朝两国的两位英雄战士在画面上并肩站立在一起，他们的后面是象征中朝友谊万古长存的松柏，两只展翅高飞的和平鸽翱翔在松柏之间。油画的下面是耀眼的红底白字：“中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万岁！”
    在到处都是巨幅欢迎标语和彩旗飘扬的街道上，三十万欢迎人群都沸腾起来了。金日成首相和其他朝鲜贵宾的敞篷汽车到了那里，那里就出现了欢乐的高潮。锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，旗帜和鲜花满天飞舞，金日成首相的头上、身上和汽车上都被花瓣和彩纸盖满，贵宾们的汽车所过之处都是花瓣成堆，彩带遍地。沿途许多房屋的围墙上，许多高大建筑物的屋顶平台上和窗口上，也都挤满了人群，热烈地鼓掌欢迎贵宾。正在进行巨大建设工程的天安门广场上，数不清的建筑工人爬上了堆满广场的木料堆和沙土堆，挥起双手，高呼欢迎口号，欢迎正在迅速进行大规模社会主义建设的朝鲜人民的友谊使者。一路上，金日成首相始终满脸堆笑，不时地同周恩来总理亲切交谈，频频向欢迎人群挥手致意。
    欢迎队伍里有刚下班还来不及休息的工人，有来自郊区的农民，走出柜台的店员，热情的大、中学生，有解放军战士和全副武装的民兵，有白发苍苍的老人和怀抱小孩的家庭妇女。从车站直到宾馆，人们载歌载舞，热情奔放，到处是动人的场景。
    石景山钢铁公司的工人们下了夜班，洗洗脸换身衣服，从四十里外赶来欢迎贵宾。工人们兴奋地说：“我们欢迎金日成首相来参观！”北京第一机床厂木型工段工长戴鸿宾热情横溢，不停地在欢迎队伍中鼓掌欢呼，并且激动地向伙伴们讲述他在朝鲜的见闻。三年前，他刚到平壤的时候，有些街道上还都是瓦砾，不到两个月，已经楼房成群。戴鸿宾说：“朝鲜工人不分日夜忘我劳动的情景，在我脑子里永远也不会忘记。最近，新义州乐园工厂工人写给我一封信，知道他们正在跨上千里马向前飞奔。我相信朝鲜人民在金日成首相领导下，建设速度一定飞跃前进。”首都民兵师的三千名民兵今天整齐地排列在车站广场上，欢迎以金日成首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团。他们全副武装，精神抖擞，欢呼声和口号声特别响亮。民兵师副师长赵德对长辛店机车车辆工厂的民兵们说：“朝鲜人民卫国保家乡的英勇精神，是我们学习的榜样。如果美帝国主义胆敢发动战争，我们就要再一次戳穿这只纸老虎。”
    住在西四羊肉胡同的赵桂荣老太太，今天一清早就赶到天安门来了，八年前当美帝国主义的战火烧到鸭绿江边时，她送自己的儿子参加了志愿军，去援助兄弟的朝鲜人民。现在她的儿子已返回了祖国。今天她来欢迎朝鲜贵宾的时候特别高兴。她说：“朝鲜和中国是好兄弟，永远不分离，美帝国主义还赖在南朝鲜不走，它们早晚也得被朝鲜人民赶出去！”
    在热情洋溢的欢迎队伍里，有中国人民志愿军部队的英雄王虎元、陆昌荣和王占山以及被朝鲜人民誉为
  “活的罗盛教”的黄治富。他们几个人在朝鲜时，都曾经见到过金日成首相。首相曾亲切地勉励过他们。首相给予他们的荣誉，成了鼓舞他们前进的力量。当他们从报纸上看到金日成首相要率领政府代表团访问我国时，他们日夜盼望，有的人甚至在梦里会见了金日成首相，又梦见了那些父母兄弟般支援和关怀他们的朝鲜人民和人民军战友。今天，他们三人怀着无限感激的心情来欢迎朝鲜贵宾，当金日成首相等路过他们面前的时候，他们用尽力量不停的鼓掌，不停地放声高呼欢迎口号。
    欢乐的浪潮一浪高于一浪，友谊的激情始终感染着每一个人的心。直到金日成首相等朝鲜贵宾乘坐的汽车驶进宾馆，欢迎的人群还在门外欢呼，久久地不愿离去。
    今天，以金日成首相为首的朝鲜全体贵宾，由外交部副部长曾涌泉，中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光等人陪同由安东到达北京。朝鲜驻中国大使馆全体人员，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国艺术团全体艺术家和在北京的朝鲜留学生，以及各国驻华使节，都到北京车站欢迎贵宾。（附图片）
