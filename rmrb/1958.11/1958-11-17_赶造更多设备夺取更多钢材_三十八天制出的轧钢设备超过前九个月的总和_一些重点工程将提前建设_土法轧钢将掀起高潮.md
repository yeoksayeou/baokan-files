Rush to Manufacture More Equipment and Seize More Steel Materials
Thirty-eight Days of Rolling Mill Equipment Production Exceeded the Total of the Previous Nine Months
Some Key Projects Will Start Construction Ahead of Schedule; Indigenous Steel Rolling Will Set Off a High Tide

    (Our Newspaper) News - A battle to seize time and rush to manufacture rolling mill equipment is being widely launched throughout the country. In the past month or so, China's machinery industry has been providing an average of one set of rolling mill equipment with an annual output of nearly 20,000 tons of steel every day, equipping China's iron and steel industry to vigorously break through the steel production barrier.

    On the basis of the major victory already achieved in rushing to manufacture smelting equipment, China's machinery industry immediately shifted to the tense battle of rushing to manufacture rolling mill equipment starting in early October. Many factory cadres and the broad masses of workers and staff have豪迈ly put forward guarantees: We will never stop fighting until a complete victory is won, so that the rolling mills and steelmaking furnaces can "form a family" as soon as possible, and all the steel ingots smelted are rolled into steel. As of November 7, in the thirty-eight days and nights of battle, forty-four sets of rolling mill equipment have been rushed out, more than the rolling mill equipment manufactured in the previous nine months. According to national requirements, Shenyang City must complete the task of manufacturing eight sets of rolling mill equipment by November 5. However, the workers and staff of more than 30 factories undertaking this task formed a fighting whole and fought nervously. As a result, the task was completed ahead of schedule on October 24.

    In this battle, many small machinery factories have also been put into the battle of manufacturing rolling mill equipment. The Jiaxing Agricultural Machinery Factory in Zhejiang Province could only manufacture general agricultural machinery in the past. Later, it adopted the method of "ants gnawing at bones" and used the original small equipment for manufacturing agricultural machinery to manufacture a 250 mm rolling mill that can roll 30,000 tons of steel annually. Fuzhou Cold Work Boiler Factory, in cooperation with Fuzhou Ship Repair Factory, has used indigenous methods and equipment to manufacture the first rolling mill in Fujian Province, which can roll more than 20 tons of steel per day, and the quality of the steel fully meets the standards.

    At present, the speed of manufacturing rolling mill equipment in various places is increasing sharply. According to incomplete statistics, various places will manufacture 110 sets of rolling mill equipment in November, which is more than 2.8 times that of October.

    In order to accelerate the manufacture of rolling mill equipment, on the one hand, various places are vigorously implementing the "small indigenous groups" policy, mobilizing the masses to rush to manufacture a batch of small rolling mill equipment to meet current urgent needs; on the other hand, they are actively organizing production capacity and technical forces to speed up the manufacture of larger and medium-sized rolling mill equipment.

    (Our Newspaper) News - The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is vigorously taking measures to increase steel production. Now, a working group for studying the leap forward in national rolling mill production and technological revolution has been established in this ministry. The scheduling and guidance work related to steel production has also been strengthened compared to the past. The twenty-four technical working groups dispatched by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to various places in the previous period will also shift their strength from now on to focus on helping various provinces solve technical problems in rolling mill production.

    In order to ensure that steel production can achieve a great leap forward in the same way as iron and steel smelting, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is also preparing to convene a national rolling mill work promotion meeting in the near future, focusing on studying the transformation of existing equipment and exchanging the many advanced experiences that have emerged in various places since the Great Leap Forward. The design institutes, research institutes, and Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology affiliated to this ministry are also preparing to trial-produce several simple friction hammers and simple rolling mills in the near future, so as to be widely promoted in rural areas, setting off a high tide of indigenous steel rolling, so that a large amount of indigenous steel can also be rolled into useful steel.

    At the same time, this ministry is also taking measures to accelerate the basic construction work of new rolling mill equipment. The key projects originally scheduled to start construction in the first half of next year have now been decided to start construction ahead of schedule. Various construction sites are also widely promoting the experience of rapid construction and rapid installation, so that as soon as the rolling mill arrives at the construction site, it can be installed quickly and put into production quickly.

### 赶造更多设备夺取更多钢材  三十八天制出的轧钢设备超过前九个月的总和  一些重点工程将提前建设　土法轧钢将掀起高潮

    赶造更多设备夺取更多钢材
    三十八天制出的轧钢设备超过前九个月的总和
    一些重点工程将提前建设　土法轧钢将掀起高潮
    本报讯　一场抢时间突击赶制轧钢设备的战斗正在全国各地广泛展开。我国机械工业最近一个多月来，平均不到一天就提供一套年产近两万吨钢材的轧钢设备，装备我国钢铁工业猛冲钢材关。
    我国机械工业在赶制冶炼设备已经取得重大胜利的基础上，紧接着又从10月初开始转入突击赶制轧钢设备的紧张战斗。许多工厂干部、广大职工群众都豪迈地提出保证：不获全胜决不收兵，让轧钢机和炼钢炉早日“成家”，把炼出来的钢锭都轧制成钢材。截至11月7日，在三十八个日日夜夜的战斗里，已经赶制出四十四套轧钢设备，比前九个月制造的轧钢设备还多。根据国家要求，沈阳市要在11月5日全部完成制造八套轧钢设备的任务。但是，担负这项任务的三十多个工厂职工组成了一个战斗的整体，紧张地进行战斗，结果，在10月24日就提前完成了任务。
    在这场战斗中，许许多多小型机械工厂，也都投入了制造轧钢设备的战斗。浙江省嘉兴农业机械厂原来只能制造一般的农业机械，后来采用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，利用原有制造农业机械的小型设备，制造出了二百五十公厘的、每年能轧制三万吨钢材的轧钢机。福州冷作锅炉厂同福州修船厂合作，已用土办法，土设备制成了福建省的第一台轧钢机，每天能轧制钢材二十吨以上，钢材的质量完全合乎标准。
    目前各地制造轧钢设备的速度正在猛烈增长。根据不完全的统计，各地要在11月份制造一百一十套轧钢设备，这个数字等于10月份的二点八倍多。
    为了加快轧钢设备的制造，各地一方面正在大力贯彻执行“小土群”方针，发动群众赶制一批小型轧钢设备，满足当前急需；另一方面正在积极组织生产能力和技术力量，加紧制造较大的和中型的轧钢设备。
    本报讯　冶金工业部正在大力采取措施增加钢材生产。现在，一个研究全国轧钢生产跃进和技术革命的工作小组已经在这个部成立。有关钢材生产的调度和指导工作也比过去加强了。冶金工业部前一时期派往各地的二十四个技术工作团，从现在开始也将转移力量着重帮助各省解决轧钢生产中的技术问题。
    为保证钢材生产能做到同钢铁冶炼一样地来个大跃进，冶金工业部还准备在最近召开全国轧钢工作促进会议，着重研究现有设备的改造工作，并且交流自大跃进以来各地出现的许多先进经验。这个部所属的设计院、研究院和北京钢铁学院等，也准备在最近要试制出几种机构简单的摩擦锤、简易轧钢机等，以便在农村中普遍推广，掀起土法轧钢的高潮，使大量的土钢也能轧制成有用的钢材。
    同时，这个部还正在采取措施，加快新轧钢设备的基本建设工作。原定在明年上半年开工的重点工程，现在决定提前开始建设。各工地还普遍推广快速施工和快速安装的经验，以便使轧钢机一运到工地就能抓紧安装、迅速投入生产。
