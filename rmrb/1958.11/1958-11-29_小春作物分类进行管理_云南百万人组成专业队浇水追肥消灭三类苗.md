    Yunnan Organizes a Million-Strong Professional Team to Water, Fertilize, and Eliminate Three Types of Seedlings

    (Our reporter Ye Zijian reports) The people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province have comprehensively strengthened the field management of spring crops. A professional team of over one million people is currently watering, fertilizing, and eliminating third-class seedlings on over 20 million mu of spring land.

    Half a month ago, Yunnan's rural population was fully mobilized to complete the sowing of nearly seven million mu of wheat and over ten million mu of spring crops such as rapeseed and broad beans. The progress was rapid, and the quality was also good, changing the past situation of extensive planting and low yield, and crude cultivation. As they transitioned to field management, the people of the province, under the slogan of "Spring crops surpass summer crops, grain and oil achieve a great turnaround," launched a high tide of spring crop field management.

    Fertilizing and watering are the main tasks of field management for spring crops in Yunnan. In the past half-month, most of the wheat and rapeseed have been watered once and fertilized once.

    Yunnan Province has also made large-area high-yield fields the focus of field management. In general counties in Yunnan, high-yield fields account for one-fifth of the total spring area, and in twelve counties such as Yuanyang, high-yield fields account for more than one-third. The total area of spring high-yield fields in the province is about five million mu. Most of the high-yield fields now have the necessary fertilizer and water. Where deep plowing is insufficient, soil is being added from above, or sand is being used to improve overly sticky soils. The 200,000 mu of high-yield fields in Yiliang County have all reached the standards of garden-style fields, achieving sufficient water, sufficient fertilizer, deep plowing, close planting, uniform seedlings, and strong seedlings.

    The method of assigning dedicated personnel and professional teams for management is a major feature of spring crop field management in Yunnan.

    Yunnan Province has made comprehensive arrangements for labor, with about 25% of the labor force dedicated to field management. These include professional teams for categorized management of wheat, rapeseed, and broad beans, as well as professional teams for mixed management, professional teams for high-yield fields, and professional teams for general fields. The professional teams have brought many new aspects to field management. Fumin County transferred more than 8,000 commune members, with Party members, League members, and militia cadres as the backbone, to form professional teams responsible for the processing and management of more than 100 mu of land. In just six or seven days, they watered and fertilized the spring crops throughout the county once, and built more than 1,000 new roadside toilets. (Attached picture)

### 小春作物分类进行管理  云南百万人组成专业队浇水追肥消灭三类苗

    小春作物分类进行管理
    云南百万人组成专业队浇水追肥消灭三类苗
    本报讯　记者叶子健报道：云南省各族人民全面加强了小春作物的田间管理，一百多万人组成的专业队伍正在二千多万亩小春地里浇水、追肥、消灭三类苗。
    在半个月前，云南农村全民动员突击完成了近七百万亩小麦和一千多万亩油菜、蚕豆等小春作物的播种工作。进度迅速，质量也好，改变了过去广种薄收、耕作粗放的状况。在转入田间管理的过程中，全省人民又在“小春超大春、粮油大翻身”的口号下掀起了小春田间管理的高潮。
    追肥和浇水是云南小春作物田间管理的主要工作。半个多月来，大部分小麦和油菜都浇过了一次水，追施了一道肥。
    云南省还把大面积丰产田作为田间管理的重点。云南一般县份的丰产田占小春总面积的五分之一，元阳等十二县的丰产田占三分之一以上。全省小春丰产田的面积共五百万亩左右。现在大部丰产田都有了必要的肥料和水。深耕不够的正在从上面培土，或挑沙改良粘性太大的土壤。宜良县的二十万亩丰产田，都已达到园田化的标准，做到水足、肥够、深耕、密植、苗齐、苗壮。
    采用专人负责和专业队负责管理的办法是云南小春田间管理的一大特点。
    云南省把劳动力作了全面安排，25％左右的劳动力固定搞田间管理。其中有小麦、油菜、蚕豆等分类管理的专业队，也有混合管理的专业队，有丰产田的专业队，还有一般田的专业队。专业队给田间管理带来了许多新气象。富民县抽调以党团员基干民兵为骨干的八千多名公社社员组成专业队，分管一百多亩田的加工管理。不过六、七天的时间，就把全县的小春作物润了一次水，施了一次灰肥，给新挖了一千多个田边厕所。（附图片）
