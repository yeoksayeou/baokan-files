Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Winter wheat in the Yellow River basin and areas to its north has basically been sown. A distinct characteristic of wheat planting and cultivation in these areas this year is the vigorous development of large-area, high-yield "satellite" fields and early sowing and management. Currently, people's communes in various regions have organized professional teams to strengthen winter management of wheat fields.

The wheat-growing areas in the Yellow River basin and areas to its north include ten provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions: Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Liaoning, and Beijing. These regions have sown a total of more than 244 million mu of winter wheat this year, an increase of more than 27 million mu over last year. At present, the sowing of winter wheat in the Yangtze River basin and areas to its south is still proceeding intensely.

In order to strive for a greater leap forward in wheat production next year, under the guidance of the idea of "less planting, high yield, more harvest," various regions in the north have designated more than 10% or about 20% of wheat fields as large-area, high-yield "satellite" fields. The per-mu yield of these high-yield "satellite" fields is planned to increase by several, dozens, or even tens of times compared to the summer harvest yield this year, reaching 5,000, 6,000, 8,000, 10,000, or more than 20,000 jin. To achieve this high-yield target, various regions have doubled their efforts to implement yield-increasing measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density in the high-yield "satellite" fields; in some areas with severe underground pests, pesticides have also been applied in conjunction with deep plowing to poison and kill pests, and generally, they have been turned into raised fields and garden-like fields. For example, in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, where all wheat fields are planned to be turned into large-area, high-yield fields, striving for a per-mu yield of 10,000 jin next year, all 550,000 mu of wheat fields have been deeply plowed to a depth of more than 1.5 chi, of which 280,000 mu have been deeply plowed to more than 3 chi. Every mu of wheat field has been fertilized with more than 400,000 jin of fertilizer, and the seeding rate has reached more than 40 jin per mu. In Xiayi County, Henan Province, the 640,000 mu of large-area, high-yield "satellite" fields, which account for more than 60% of the county's wheat fields, have been fertilized with 70,000 jin more fertilizer per mu than ordinary wheat fields, reaching more than 300,000 jin; the seeding rate per mu is 20 jin more than ordinary wheat fields, reaching more than 50 jin, and all are good varieties. The large-area, high-yield fields planted in Anguo County, Hebei Province, and Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, have been leveled very smoothly, and the ridges are as straight as lines, making full preparations for irrigation.

In addition to the meticulous planting of large-area, high-yield fields, various regions have also planted ordinary wheat fields well. According to inspections, most of the ordinary wheat fields in various regions have been deeply plowed to more than 1 chi; most have been applied with base fertilizer, and the general fertilizer application rate per mu is about 30,000 to 50,000 jin. To achieve dense planting, the general seeding rate is about 30 jin per mu.

Good wheat planting is the mainstream of winter wheat sowing this year. However, according to inspections in various regions, there are still a few wheat fields that have not been applied with base fertilizer or have been applied with less, which cannot meet the fertilizer needs of densely planted wheat; some wheat fields have a serious lack of seedlings; some wheat fields have been infested with pests; and some wheat seedlings are growing too vigorously, which is not conducive to overwintering. In response to the above situations, many regions, after the end of wheat sowing, immediately strengthened the winter management of wheat fields, focusing on "eliminating the three types of seedlings in the seedling stage." Various counties in the Liaocheng area of Shandong Province have universally launched a field management campaign of "four inspections and four comparisons," such as checking and replanting seedlings. Xushui County, Hebei Province, has already launched the first upsurge of wheat field management. More than 610 professional wheat field management teams in the county are actively checking and replanting seedlings, eliminating pests, watering, and topdressing. After two days of hard work by the professional teams, locusts and other pests were eliminated on more than 47,000 mu of wheat fields. (Attached picture)

    北方冬小麦种得好管得早
    各地高额丰产“卫星”田一般达到麦地百分之十至二十
    及时注意幼苗越冬管理力争提早消灭三类苗
    新华社2日讯　黄河流域及其以北地区的冬小麦已经基本种完。大搞大面积高额丰产“卫星”田和种得好管得早，是这些地区今年种植和培育小麦的一个鲜明特点。当前，各地人民公社都组织了专业队对麦田加强了越冬管理。
    黄河流域及其以北地区的种麦地区，包括河南、河北、山东、山西、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、新疆、辽宁以及北京等十个省、市和自治区，这些地区今年共计播种冬小麦二亿四千多万亩，比去年扩大二千七百万亩以上。目前，长江流域及其以南各地的冬小麦播种工作仍在紧张进行。
    为了力争明年小麦产量实现更大的跃进，在少种、高产、多收的思想指导下，北方各地都划出10％以上或20％左右的麦地作为大面积高额丰产“卫星”田。这些高额丰产“卫星”田的每亩产量，都计划比今年夏收产量提高几倍、十几倍到几十倍，达到五千斤、六千斤、八千斤、一万斤或两万斤以上。为了实现这个高产指标，各地在高额丰产“卫星”田上都加倍地贯彻了水、肥、土、种、密等增产措施；部分地下虫害严重的地区，还结合深翻撒了农药，毒杀害虫，并且一般都做到了畦田化、园田化。例如全部麦田都计划搞成大面积高额丰产田、力争明年亩产万斤的山东省寿张县，五十五万亩麦田全部深翻一尺五寸以上，其中有二十八万亩深翻了三尺多，全部麦田每亩都施肥四十多万斤，每亩下种量达到四十斤以上。河南省夏邑县占全县麦田60％以上的六十四万多亩大面积高产“卫星”田，每亩施肥量比一般麦田多七万斤，达到三十万斤以上；每亩下种量比一般麦田多二十斤，达到五十多斤，并且全部都是良种。河北省安国和陕西省长安等县种植的大面积高额丰产田，地整得很平坦，埂直如线，为灌溉作好了充分准备。
    各地除对大面积高额丰产田进行了细致的种植外，对一般麦田种得也很好。据检查，各地的一般麦田，绝大部分都深翻一尺以上；绝大部分都施了底肥，一般每亩施肥量都在三万斤到五万斤左右。为了实现密植，一般每亩都下种三十斤左右。
    小麦种得好，是今年冬小麦播种的主流。但据各地检查，还有少数麦田没施底肥或施的较少，不能满足密植的小麦对肥分的需要；有的麦田缺苗现象严重；有的麦田发生了虫害；有的麦苗生长过旺，不利越冬。针对上述情况，很多地区在小麦播种结束后，都立即以“把三类苗消灭在幼苗阶段”为中心，对麦田普遍加强了越冬管理。山东省聊城专区各县普遍展开了查苗补苗等“四查四比”的田间管理运动。河北省徐水县已经掀起了第一次麦田管理高潮。全县六百一十多个麦田管理专业队积极查苗补苗、除虫、浇水、追肥。经专业队两天鏖战，即在四万七千多亩麦田上消灭了蝗虫等害虫。（附图片）
