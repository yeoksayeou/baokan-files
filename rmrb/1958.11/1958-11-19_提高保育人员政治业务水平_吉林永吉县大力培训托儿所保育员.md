Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 18th: Yongji County, Jilin Province, is taking various measures to vigorously train nursery workers.

Yongji County has established and is planning to establish approximately 400 nurseries. Currently, a large number of nursery workers lack the knowledge to educate young children. When children are naughty, they often use things like "tigers" to scare them; they teach children to sing songs for adults; and there are common problems in areas such as clothing, food, housing, and hygiene. The Yongji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to intensify the training of nursery and educational staff in nurseries. The nursery worker training class, which opened in Shuanghe Town on the 6th, has 400 participants. The teaching materials are jointly compiled by the County Women's Federation, the Bureau of Culture and Education, and the Health Station, and include children's language learning, songs, riddles, and hygiene knowledge. The Bureau of Culture and Education has transferred seven nursery teachers who graduated from normal schools to serve as instructors. The county plans to use the trainees from this training class as the backbone to establish a large number of nursery and guidance groups after the training class ends, so as to universally improve the political and professional level of nursery teachers throughout the county.

At the same time, the county is organizing temporary nursery worker training classes based on the commune. Five or six communes have already completed their temporary training classes, training more than 100 nursery workers. In addition, the county is also preparing to add a preschool teacher class to the normal school in order to continuously improve the political and professional level of nursery staff in the future.

    提高保育人员政治业务水平
    吉林永吉县大力培训托儿所保育员
    新华社长春18日电　吉林省永吉县采取多种办法大力培训保育员。
    永吉县已办和正在筹办的托儿所约有四百所。目前有大量的保育员缺乏教养幼儿的知识，她们在孩子淘气时，常用“老虎”等吓唬孩子；教孩子们学大人唱的歌；在衣食住卫生等方面也普遍存在一些问题。中共永吉县委决定加紧训练一批托儿所的保、教人员。6日在双河镇开学的保育员训练班，共有四百人参加学习，教材是由县妇联、文教局和保健站联合编写的，包括幼儿学话、学歌、谜语、卫生知识等。文教局抽调了七名幼儿师范毕业的保育员作辅导员。县里计划在这个训练班结束以后，再以训练班的学员为骨干，成立大量的保育和辅导小组，使全县教养员的政治业务水平普遍提高一步。
    与此同时，全县正以公社为单位开办保育员临时训练班。已有五、六个公社的临时训练班结业，共训练出保育员一百多名。此外，县里还筹备在师范学校增设幼师班，以便今后不断的提高保育人员的政治业务水平。
