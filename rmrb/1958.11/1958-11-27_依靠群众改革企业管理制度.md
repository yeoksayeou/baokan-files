    Rely on the Masses to Reform Enterprise Management Systems
    Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    Relying on Workers or Relying on Systems?

    Before the rectification movement, our factory had a total of 133 rules and regulations, and more than 700 types of forms and reports. There were 26 departments, and management personnel accounted for 26.4% of the total number of employees. The organization was bloated, there were too many superfluous personnel, and the phenomenon of mutual procrastination and buck-passing occurred frequently. Many rules and regulations were not conducive to the development of production but restricted the enthusiasm of the masses, leading to many contradictions between the masses and the leadership.

    Although the production plan was also submitted to the lower levels for discussion, the main purpose was to have the masses guarantee its implementation. The daily and shift plans were arranged by the departments, often impractical. When workers completed their production tasks ahead of schedule, they could not receive the next batch of materials.

    From product design to processing, everything was stipulated by the departments. Processing was done according to drawings, and processes were followed according to regulations. Every part and every procedure was issued with a process card, which everyone had to follow. Even if the drawings were wrong, they had to be approved before they could be modified. A worker's suggestion went through more than ten units, so a small suggestion took at least three months to be approved, and a big one took half a year or a year. In terms of product quality, emphasis was placed on supervising workers, so there were as many as 147 inspectors. It seemed that only the inspectors valued quality, so the inspectors often had conflicts with the workers, even to the point of antagonism.

    Similarly, in the management of finance, personnel, and other aspects, cumbersome procedures had to be followed. Taking travel expenses as an example, approval was given by one department, review was done by the accounting section, and payment was made to the finance section. A worker who wanted to leave the factory had to run through all the workshops and departments of the factory and get stamps from each unit before completing the departure procedures. For example, if a worker wanted to continue working outside of the eight-hour workday, he needed the approval of the foreman, the workshop director, the safety and technology section, the general affairs section, and the factory director.

    In short, management was about departments making systems and drafting regulations, and its most prominent feature was "managing people," and managing them very rigidly. This raised the question of whether to rely on the working class wholeheartedly to improve production, as proposed by the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, or to rely on a small number of people in the departments to "manage" production with a set of systems.

          After the Decentralization of Management Authority

    The Great Leap Forward exposed many problems with the old management system. In this context, we learned from the experience of Qinghua Tool Factory and, under the leadership of the Party committee, promoted worker participation in management, cadre participation in labor, and the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations. This change altered the past situation where a small number of people "managed" the majority, and a new atmosphere emerged in which cadres and workers managed the enterprise together, united and working as one. Due to the decentralization of management authority, profound changes have taken place in workers' thinking, cadre-worker relations, worker-worker relations, and the relationship between production and management.

    These changes are prominently manifested in the following aspects:

    First, the workers' sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs has been enhanced. Production teams have the power to schedule production plans, set labor quotas, manage personnel attendance, compile wage statistics, manage tools, etc. The workers in the teams elect their own team leaders and various "members" to be responsible for various tasks. In this way, workers feel that their responsibilities are greater. Worker Wang Linfu said: "Now we are the masters, managing ourselves." Because the management authority is in the hands of the team, the workers' sense of responsibility for completing the national production plan has also been greatly strengthened. With workers participating in management, the situation of "each person sweeps the snow from his own doorstep" and only operating for eight hours has also changed, forming a situation where everyone manages the plan and everyone cares about production. Now, every month, as long as the workshop leaders tell everyone the monthly tasks and put forward the requirements for the delivery date of the goods, the workers immediately discuss and arrange the plan through the team meeting, and everyone discusses and arranges the plan, and everyone makes guarantees, conducts inspections in the middle of the month, and summarizes it at the end of the month. In each discussion, possible problems are raised and solutions are found. This not only makes the plan timely and accurate, but also allows workers to know what to do that day and what to do for the whole month. Production efficiency is constantly improving. For example, in the first month that workers in the diesel engine workshop participated in management (June), diesel engine production increased by 300 units compared to January. The bearing team in the workshop completed the June production plan seven days ahead of schedule. For example, in the oil pump workshop in September, near the end of the month, the entire workshop had completed the task, only the 216 oil pump housing team was in a dangerous situation. When this matter was known to the workers on the nearby beds, it spread from one to two, and from two to three, and each team immediately came to support, and the task of this team was finally completed two hours ahead of schedule.

    Through extensive airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates, this mass enterprise management reform has not only changed the management form but also changed the face of the Party's political and ideological work. More people are doing political and ideological work, and advanced workers are rising up to do political and ideological work, especially the team leaders and activists are more active. In order to complete the team's production tasks and improve team unity, they actively carry out political work and ideological work. For example, the core sleeve team and the oil tip housing team in the oil pump workshop, some people have not been active for a long time, and the quota has not been reached. The team found that the main problem was ideological, so they patiently helped educate them, and finally, several people changed, and the output quickly increased by more than double. But as a worker in the diesel engine workshop said: "After the rectification, the consciousness of everyone who participated in enterprise management has been improved, but there are still backward ideas and backward workers. This requires continuous political and ideological work." Through the rectification and a series of mass enterprise management revolutions, workers have not only learned to use debate to solve key production problems but also learned to use debate to solve ideological problems between workers. For example, after Wang Jinxin of the diesel engine workshop's body team changed from piece-rate wages to time wages, production declined. The team debated his erroneous ideas. Through the debate, Wang Jinxin's thinking was cleared, and his enthusiasm for production immediately increased. As the secretary of the Party branch of the diesel engine workshop said: "Distinguishing right from wrong through debate is a good way for the masses to educate themselves." In the past, only cadres visited workers' homes, but now workers visit each other's homes, and ideological work is carried out through visits. As the workers' sense of ownership has increased, more and more people are doing political and ideological work.

    While the production management authority and financial management authority were decentralized, some technical management authority was also decentralized. With the decentralization of various powers, the relationship between workers and technicians has also changed, and the thinking of technicians has also changed. In the past, technicians did not approach workers, thinking that they were "smarter" than workers, ignoring the opinions of workers, which greatly undermined the enthusiasm of workers. Now, with the decentralization of power, some technicians have been sent to the workshops. By working close to the workers, they have realized in practice that the old workers have rich operational experience, and they gradually feel that their past closed-door practices were wrong. Therefore, one hundred suggestions that were not adopted in the past are now being adopted again. In this way, the thinking of engineers and technicians has become more open, and the opinions of workers have become fewer. Workers also go to engineers and technicians to discuss their opinions together. This is not only beneficial to the ideological transformation of engineers and technicians but also beneficial to giving play to the enthusiasm of the workers in making technical revolutions, beneficial to the Great Leap Forward in production, and can shorten the distance between engineers and technicians and production workers.

          Carry out Ideological Struggle

    The great reform of enterprise management in our factory has not been smooth sailing. The entire process of reform is a process of mobilizing the masses and a process of struggle between advanced ideas and right-leaning conservative ideas. The struggle between these two ideas is very sharp and intense, and it is mainly manifested in two aspects: between cadres and the masses and between the advanced and backward among the workers.

    This struggle between cadres and the masses has been prominently exposed in almost every link since the decentralization of power, especially among technicians. They are superstitious about books, thinking that their views are scientific and that "workers have narrow vision." Some even said publicly: "It's just messing around to let workers manage." They said: "It's okay to have workers participate in administrative management, but technical management is not possible!" They made technical management very mysterious, seemingly unattainable. A struggle was carried out against the "theory of the mystery of technical management," and facts were used to educate technicians, so that they went from not believing in the masses to believing in the masses and seeing the wisdom and strength of the workers. At the same time, they also helped workers to emancipate their minds and break superstitions. In the management departments, the struggle was also very sharp. They emphasized the complexity of production management, and they were superstitious about rules, regulations and reports to "manage" production. In fact, they were thinking about "managing" people. Some of them said openly: "My thinking is just not clear. I don't believe it. Just wait and see. It must be chaos." At the beginning of the decentralization of power, the issue of product inspection caused a struggle. The inspection department always felt that something was wrong. In order to find a basis for themselves, they went to fraternal factories several times to explore information. Their idea was that only inspectors are responsible to the country for quality. It seems that the factory director is not responsible to the country, let alone the workers who can be responsible to the country for product quality.

    At the beginning of the decentralization of power, the leadership's thinking was not firm enough. Regarding the above-mentioned issues, especially the issues of technical management, there was still a superstitious mindset, and they did not dare to touch it or dare to boldly believe in the workers. This issue is essentially a question of who to rely on and who to believe in. Is it to believe in and rely on the vast masses who have been mobilized, or to believe in and rely on a small number of experts and engineers? Is it to grasp or abandon the Party's leadership in technology? At that time, the leadership invited the responsible comrades of Qinghua Tool Factory to come to the factory to introduce their experience in decentralizing power, wanting to learn from the experience of Qinghua Tool Factory and hand over the power of enterprise management to the workers. However, when the workers really rose up, they were somewhat hesitant. For example, at that time, the workers in the water tank workshop and the blank workshop put forward the opinion that certain powers should be decentralized and made preparations, but the leadership was still not decisive enough and was still piloting there, considering whether the workers could really manage it. The workers were very enthusiastic about participating in enterprise management. Practice has proved that the workers themselves can not only manage but also manage better than when a small number of cadres managed in the past. Not only can they manage the production plan, but they can also manage the technical management work very well.

      Three Issues for Consolidation and Improvement

    The main problems that exist now are:

    1.  The participation of cadres in labor in "two participations, one reform" (except for those who have been sent to the workshops) is not normal. It is tight at the beginning and loose at the end, especially the factory-level cadres (including the departments). Currently, they are too busy with affairs to go down. This is the case for management personnel, and it is also the case for engineers and technicians. Although the Party committee has organized and mobilized technicians to go down several times, after they go down, they come back up after a period of time, forming a situation where they will not go down unless they are forced to.

    2.  On the issue of breaking and establishing, breaking has been done, but establishing was not grasped tightly later. To this day, some systems that need to be established are not perfect and are not satisfactory. In particular, a lot of work still needs to be done on how to help the teams manage well and improve their management level after the decentralization of power. That is to say, after the decentralization of power, the responsibilities of cadres have not only not been reduced but have been increased. Because in the past, they were subjectivist and did their own thing, but now they are managing the enterprise by following the mass line. In this process, how cadres can strengthen their leadership, that is, how to be both democratic and centralized, how to follow the mass line and strengthen the Party's leadership at the same time, still requires exploration and summarization of a set of experiences.

    3.  The development of the work of consolidating and improving "two participations, one reform," especially after the workers' participation in management, is unbalanced. Relatively speaking, the diesel engine workshop is better now, while other workshops are worse, and the oil pump workshop and the tool workshop are even worse.

    The implementation of the major reform of enterprise management of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" is a manifestation of the communist spirit of the workers in our factory, the result of putting politics in command, and one of the great products of the Party's rectification movement. We will continue to implement the spirit of the rectification movement, resolutely follow the mass line in enterprise management, solve various contradictions at any time, and through "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," make our enterprise management level truly take a big step forward.

    依靠群众改革企业管理制度
    中共上海柴油机厂委员会
    依靠工人还是凭制度办事
    整风运动以前，本厂共有规章制度一百三十三种，各种表报达七百余种。科室组织有二十六个，管理人员占职工总数的26.4％，机构臃肿，人浮于事；相互拖拉扯皮现象经常出现。许多规章制度，不是有利于生产的发展，而是约束了群众积极性的发挥，群众与领导之间矛盾很多。
    生产计划虽然也交下面讨论，但主要是要群众保证执行。每日每班计划均由科室安排，常常不切合实际，工人生产任务提前完成了，还领不到下一批活的料。
    从产品设计到加工，全由科室规定，加工按图纸、工艺按规定，每一零件每一程序均发工艺卡，任何人必须遵循，即使图纸有错误，也得经过申请批准，才能修改。工人一件建议经十多个单位流转，因此小建议从提出到批准，至少三个月，大的就得半载一年。在产品质量上强调对工人进行监督，因此检查人员多至一百四十七人，似乎只有检查人员重视质量，因而检查人员就和工人经常发生矛盾，甚至处于对立地位。
    其他在财务、人事等管理方面，同样须经过繁复的手续。以出差费为例，批准是一个部门，审查属会计科，付款到财务科；一个工人调离厂须至全厂车间科室跑遍，经过各单位盖章才能办理离开手续。又如工人八小时以外继续做一些工作，需要经过工长、车间主任、安技科、总务科同意、厂长批准才行。
    总之，管理就是科室订制度，拟规章，其突出的特点就是“管人”，而且管得很死。这就提出了究竟是根据党的七届二中全会所提出的全心全意依靠工人阶级搞好生产，还是依靠科室少数人凭着一套制度来“管”好生产的问题。
          管理权下放以后
    大跃进的形势暴露出旧的一套管理制度有许多问题，在此情况下，学习了庆华工具厂的经验，在党委领导下，推行了工人参加管理，干部参加劳动，改革不合理的规章制度。这一变革，改变了过去少数人“管”多数人的情况，出现了干部和工人大家一起进行企业管理，上下一致、打成一片的新风气。由于管理权力下放，在工人思想上、干群关系上、工人与工人之间关系上、生产与管理关系上，都发生了深刻的变化。
    这些变化突出地表现在如下几个方面：
    首先是工人的主人翁责任感提高了。生产小组有了生产计划调度权、工时定额权、人事考勤权、工资统计权、工具管理权等等，小组工人就自己推选组长和各
  “员”，分工负责各项工作。这样工人感到自己责任更大了。工人王林福说：“现在阿拉是主人，自己管自己了。”由于管理权由小组掌握，工人完成国家生产计划的责任感也大大加强。工人参加管理，“各人自扫门前雪”只管操作八小时的情况也变化了，形成了人人管理计划，个个关心生产的局面。现在每月生产任务只要车间领导把月度任务告诉大家，提出商品出厂期的要求，工人自己就马上通过小组会进行讨论，大家来商量安排计划，并且大家订保证，月中进行检查，月底再加以总结，在每次讨论中都提出可能碰到的问题，并找出解决的办法。这就不仅使计划及时准确，而且工人也知道当天做什么，整个月干什么。生产效率不断提高。如柴油机车间工人参加管理的第一个月（6月份），柴油机生产比1月份增加三百台，该车间的轴承小组提前七天完成了6月份生产计划。如油泵车间9月份接近月底时，全车间都完成了任务，只有二百一十六油泵外壳小组处于危险境地。当这个事情被附近床子上的工人知道后，一传二，二传三，各小组立即都来支援，这个小组的任务终于也提前二小时完成了。
    经过大鸣大放、大字报、大争大辩，这场群众性的企业管理上的大改革，不仅在管理形式上有了改变，而且使党的政治思想工作面貌也有了变化。做政治思想工作的人多了，先进的工人群众都起来做政治思想工作，尤其是小组长积极分子更加活跃了，为完成小组的生产任务，搞好小组团结，他们积极进行政治工作和思想工作。如油泵车间芯套小组和油尖外壳小组，有几个人长期以来不积极，定额达不到，小组发现主要是思想问题，就耐心帮助教育，终于几个人都转变了，产量很快的提高一倍多。但是正如柴油机车间一个工人所说：“经过整风，工人参加企业管理，每个人的觉悟都有所提高，但落后的思想，落后的工人还是有的。这就必须不断地进行政治思想工作。”经过整风和群众性的企业管理上的一系列革命，工人不仅学会了用辩论的方法解决生产上的关键问题，也学会了用辩论的方法解决工人之间思想上的问题。如柴油机车间机体工组王金鑫在计件工资改为计时工资后，生产下降，小组就针对他的错误思想进行辩论，通过辩论，王金鑫的思想通了，生产的积极性马上就高涨了。正如柴油机车间党总支书记说：“通过辩论，分清是非，是群众自己教育自己的好办法。”过去光干部到工人家中访问，现在工人互相到家中访问，通过访问来进行思想工作。由于工人群众主人翁感增强了，做政治思想工作的人就越来越多。
    在生产管理权、财经管理权下放的同时，一部分技术管理权随之下放。随着各种权力的下放，工人和技术人员的关系也有了变化，技术人员的思想也起了变化。过去技术人员不接近工人，自以为比工人“高明”，漠视工人意见，大大损害工人的积极性。现在随着权力下放，部分技术人员下放到车间，通过劳动接近工人，他们在实践中，认识到老工人是有着丰富操作经验的，渐渐地感到过去自己闭门造车的不对，因此，过去一百个不采纳的建议，今天重新被采纳了。这样一来，工程技术人员思想开朗了，工人的意见也少了；工人有了意见也去找技术人员一道商量了。这不仅对工程技术人员思想改造有利，对发挥工人群众大闹技术革命的积极性有利，对生产大跃进有利，而且可以缩短工程技术人员同生产工人之间的距离。
          开展思想斗争
    企业管理的大改革，我厂不是一帆风顺的。改革的整个过程，是发动群众的过程，是先进思想与右倾保守思想斗争的过程。这两种思想的斗争是很尖锐剧烈的，它主要地表现在两个方面：干部与群众之间和工人群众的先进与落后之间。
    在干部与群众之间的这种斗争，从权力下放开始，几乎每个环节都暴露得十分突出，特别表现在技术人员身上。他们迷信书本，以为自己看法科学，“工人眼光狭小”。甚至有人公开说：“要工人来管理，简直是瞎胡闹。”他们说：“行政管理要工人参加还马马虎虎，技术管理可不行！”把技术管理说得十分神秘，似乎高不可攀。同“技术管理神秘论”进行了斗争，用事实教育了技术人员，使他们从不相信群众到相信群众，看到工人的智慧与力量。同时也帮助工人解放思想，破除迷信。在管理科室中，斗争也是很尖锐的。他们强调生产管理的复杂性，迷信规章制度和报表“管”生产，实际思想上就是“管”人。他们有的公开说：“我的思想就是不通，不信走着看好了，一定要乱。”权力下放一开始，产品检验的问题就引起了斗争。检查科总是觉得不对头，为了给自己找到根据，曾三番五次的到兄弟厂去探索情报，他们的想法是：只有检验员才是代表国家对质量负责的，好像厂长对国家也不负责，更不相信工人群众能够对产品质量负责对国家负责了。
    权力下放的开始，在领导思想上也是不够坚决的。对上述一些问题，尤其是技术管理上的问题，仍然有着迷信思想，不敢碰，不敢大胆地相信工人群众。这个问题在实质上，就是究竟依靠谁相信谁的问题，是相信和依靠发动起来的广大群众呢，还是相信和依靠少数专家工程师？是抓紧还是放弃党在技术上的领导权？当时领导上虽然邀请了庆华工具厂的负责同志来厂介绍他们权力下放的经验，想学习庆华工具厂的经验，把企业管理的大权交给工人群众，但当工人群众真正起来以后，又有些犹豫不决。如当时水箱车间和毛坯车间工人，提出了某些权力应当下放的意见，并做了准备工作，但领导上仍然不够果断，还在那里试点，考虑工人是不是真能管起来。而工人群众对参加企业管理是十分积极的。实践证明，工人自己管，不但能管，而且管的比过去少数干部管的时候好的多；不但生产计划能管起来，就是技术管理工作管的也很好。
      巩固提高的三个问题
    目前存在的问题主要有三个：
    一、两参一改中的干部参加劳动（下放到车间的例外）情况不正常，前紧后松，尤其厂级（科室在内）干部，目前由于忙于事务，处在下不去的状态，管理人员如此，工程技术人员亦如此。党委虽曾组织动员技术人员下去过几次，但下去后，搞一段时间就又上来，形成不赶不下去。
    二、在破与立的问题上，破是破了，但在立的问题上后来没抓紧，直到今天，一些需要建立的制度，还不完善，不能令人满意。尤其对权力下放后如何帮助小组管好，提高小组的管理水平，还需要做很多工作。就是说，权力下放，干部的责任不但不是减轻了，反而是加重了，因为过去主观主义自搞一套，现在是走群众路线来管理企业，在这当中，干部如何加强领导，就是既民主又集中，既要走群众路线，又必须加强党的领导，还需要摸索和总结出一套经验来。
    三、两参一改，尤其是工人参加管理后的巩固提高工作上发展的不平衡，比较起来，目前柴油机车间比较好，其他车间较差，油泵车间与工具车间更差一些。
    实行两参一改三结合这一企业管理上的重大改革，是我们厂里工人同志发扬共产主义风格的表现，是政治挂帅的结果，是党的整风运动的伟大产物之一。我们将继续贯彻整风精神，在企业管理中，坚决走群众路线，随时解决各种矛盾，通过“两参一改三结合”，使我们的企业管理水平真正提高一大步。
