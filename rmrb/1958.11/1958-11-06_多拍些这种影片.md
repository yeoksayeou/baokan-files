Shoot More Films Like This
    Except for one actress, all the other performers in "Huang Baomei" are workers. Whether young or old, male or female, I think they all acted very well. This shows that our workers can also be actors. Baomei shed tears when arguing with the technician about repairing the machine. It's not easy for her to act like that. Look, her performance is so natural, without any awkwardness. The other comrades also look like old people when they play old people, and young people when they play young people. Zhang Xiulan produced a lot of white yarn, and when she gets angry, it seems real. After being transferred to the lane, Baomei was very busy, but she sat there steadily drinking tea. Later, Baomei heard that she was sick, so after work she went to her house to get medicine and pour boiled water for her. Her shot of secretly looking at Baomei in bed was very realistic. I found her both funny and lovable.
    I also participated in filming a few shots in this movie. To be honest, I was very excited when I was filming. Before liberation, who looked up to a young girl? Even watching movies was not easy. If your clothes were a bit dirty, you couldn't get into the cinema. I never thought I could appear on the screen now. I think we can shoot more films like this, made by workers and reflecting the lives of workers.

    多拍些这种影片
    “黄宝妹”除一位演员外，其它都是工人演的。不管青年、老年，也不管男工、女工，我看都演得很好。可见我们工人也能当演员。宝妹和技术员争论检修机器时掉泪了，她能这样表演真不容易，你看，她表演得那么自然，没啥束手束脚。别的同志也是老像老，少像少。张秀兰白花出得多，发脾气时像真的一样。调弄堂后，宝妹忙煞忙，她却笃笃定定坐着喝茶。后来宝妹听说她有病，在放工后到她家里弄药倒开水，她在床上偷看宝妹的镜头，表演得很逼真。我看了觉得她又可笑又可爱。
    在这部电影里，我也参加拍了几个镜头。说真话，我拍戏时是很激动的。解放前，一个毛头姑娘啥人看得起，就是看电影也是不容易呀，衣服脏些，电影院就跑不进去，想不到现在能走上银幕了。像这种由工人演的、反映工人生活的影片，我觉得以后还可以多拍点。
