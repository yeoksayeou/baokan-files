    Africa
    Senegal David Diop
                (Translated by Tie Xian)
    Africa, my Africa, Africa of proud warriors, Africa of my ancestors, Africa of snow-capped mountains, Africa sung by my aged grandmother, you stand on the distant riverbank—I have never known you.
    But in my eyes, there is all of you.
    I see the dark bloodstains on the fields,
    I see: blood and sweat as sweat droplets from the labor of your enslaved,
    The enslavement of your children.
    Africa, tell me, Africa,
    That back bent by the burden of humiliation,
    That back trembling with the stripes drawn by the whip,
    On the scorching road under the blazing sun,
    Answering the whip with repeated "Yes, yes,"
    Could that person be you?
    A stern voice answers me:
    "Impatient son!
    Do you see the trees in the distance?
    It is a young and sturdy tree,
    Among some withered flowers, it appears especially lonely—
    That is Africa, your Africa,
    It grows patiently and stubbornly,
    And its fruit gradually fills with the sour juice of freedom."

    非洲
    塞内加尔　大卫·迪奥普
                （铁弦译）非洲，我的非洲啊，高傲的战士们的非洲，我祖先的非洲，雪峰的非洲，我年迈的祖母所歌唱的非洲，你立在远方的河岸上——我从来还不认识你。但我的目光中，却有你的一切，我看见田野上的深暗血迹，我看见：血和汗作为你奴隶的劳动的汗滴，你子孙们的奴役。非洲啊，你要告诉我，非洲，那被屈辱的重负压弯了的背脊，那被鞭子抽出条条血痕而颤抖着的背脊，在烈日当头、地面火烫的路上，向鞭子连声回答：“是，是”的，那个人莫非就是你？一个严峻的声音回答我：“没有耐性的儿子呀！你看见远方的树木吗？那是一棵年青而坚实的树，在一些枯萎的花朵中，它显得特别孤单——那就是非洲，你的非洲，它耐心和顽强地成长，而它的果实逐渐地充满着自由的酸味汁浆。”
