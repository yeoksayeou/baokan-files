Xinhua News Agency, November 11th dispatch from Washington: A ministerial meeting of eighteen participating countries in the "Colombo Plan" was held in Seattle on the 10th. The agenda was to discuss the "aid" provided by Western countries to underdeveloped nations.

U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his opening speech on the morning of the 10th, proposed a "five-point plan for international economic assistance," which included expanding international trade, providing technical assistance, encouraging private capital exports, providing bank loans, and expanding the scope of lending.

This U.S. President, targeting the desire of Southeast Asian countries to obtain funds for construction, emphatically put forward suggestions to pave the way for the capital exports of U.S. monopoly capitalist groups. He said that the financial resources of U.S. private capital are much greater than the financial resources that the U.S. government can provide. He said that if the United States is to "provide the greatest assistance to less developed countries, it needs to absorb the largest amount of its (U.S.) private financial resources."

When talking about expanding trade, Eisenhower mentioned that economically underdeveloped countries need to raise funds through international trade in order to purchase imported equipment. He even pretentiously suggested "relaxing restrictions that hinder trade." However, he did not specifically mention what actions the United States would take in this regard. As everyone knows, the U.S. policy of dumping agricultural products, suppressing raw material prices, and restricting the import of goods from other countries has caused great losses to many Southeast Asian countries.

    “科伦坡计划”国家在西雅图开会
    美国总统放出“援助”之饵
    提出五点计划企图为美国资本输出开路
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：十八个“科伦坡计划”参加国的部长级会议于10日在西雅图举行，议程是讨论西方国家对不发达国的“援助”问题。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔10日上午在致开幕词时提出了一项“国际经济援助的五点计划”，其中包括扩大国际贸易、提供技术援助、鼓励私人资本输出、提供银行贷款和扩大贷款的范围。
    这位美国总统，针对着东南亚国家希望得到资金来从事建设这一情况，着重地提出了为美国的垄断资本集团的资本输出开辟道路的建议。他说，美国的私人资本的财力比美国政府所能够提供的财力要大得多。他说，要美国“对不大发达的国家作出最大的援助的话，就需要最大量地吸收它（美国）的私人财源”。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到扩大贸易时提到，经济不发达的国家需要通过国际贸易来筹集资金，以便购买进口装备。他甚至还煞有介事地建议“放松阻碍贸易往来的限制”。但是，他没有具体谈到美国在这方面到底会采取甚么行动。大家知道，美国倾销农产品，压低原料价格和限制其他国家的货品进口的政策，曾使许多东南亚国家蒙受很大损失。
