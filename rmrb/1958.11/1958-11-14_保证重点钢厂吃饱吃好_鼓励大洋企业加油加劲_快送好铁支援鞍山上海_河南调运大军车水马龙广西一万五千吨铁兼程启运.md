According to Henan Daily, on November 9th, Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, transferred 10,046 tons of pig iron to support Anshan, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places. The iron was inspected by personnel from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and various iron receiving units, and all of it was deemed to be of acceptable quality. It is now being loaded onto trains for shipment.

To launch a large "satellite" of iron transfer, Xinxiang Prefecture established iron transfer offices in various counties and assigned a county Party secretary to specifically manage the iron transfer work. Lei Feng, Deputy Secretary of the Yuanyang County Party Committee, personally led the masses, driving eighty horse-drawn carts to transport iron. The counties also used extensive airing of views, big debates to enhance the understanding of the cadres and the masses regarding the importance of iron transfer. Wuzhi County proposed the resounding slogan: "Refine good iron, produce good steel, send good iron and good steel to the Central Government." To provide timely guidance to the iron transfer work, the Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee held telephone conferences with the first secretaries of the county Party committees from the 7th to the 9th, checking the iron transfer work, exchanging experiences in iron transfer work, and promoting the smooth progress of iron transfer work in various counties, with the iron transfer figures increasing day by day. The entire prefecture transferred 510 tons of iron on the 6th, and on the first day of the Prefectural Committee's telephone conference, 1,684 tons of iron were transferred; on the second day, 2,363 tons were transferred; and on the third day, it increased to 10,046 tons. The best performance in completing the iron transfer task was the Tangyin-Junxian cooperative area. This cooperative area transferred 5,500 tons of pig iron in one day on the 9th, and together with the iron transferred previously, it had exceeded the target of transferring 6,000 tons of iron to the Central Government by 8%. To deliver the good iron to the factories as quickly as possible, the entire prefecture vigorously organized the iron transportation work. Seven counties, including Anyang and Wuzhi, organized 2,547 horse-drawn carts and 144 trucks to transport iron.

Also reported: On the 10th, Luoyang Prefecture also transferred more than 10,000 tons of qualified pig iron, native steel, and scrap iron to Shanghai to support steelmaking.

Starting from the evening of the 9th, from the banks of the Yi and Luo Rivers to the Funiu Mountains, more than 100,000 people and tens of thousands of vehicles in the entire prefecture formed a transportation army, fighting day and night! On the highways leading from Luoyang to various counties, strings of trucks loaded with pig iron sped along, the headlights illuminating the night like daytime, with vehicles, horses, and people carrying pig iron and native steel towards the highways and railway stations.

To quickly transfer good iron to the Shanghai steel plants, since November, the Luoyang Prefectural Party Committee has repeatedly instructed the counties to do a good job in pig iron transfer. On the 6th, Wang Huizhi, Secretary of the Luoyang Prefectural Party Committee, proposed ten measures for steel transfer at a telephone conference with the county Party secretaries, and particularly emphasized that the amount of pig iron transferred is one of the criteria for measuring and inspecting the steel production situation. Before organizing this large "satellite" launch for iron transfer, Luoyang Prefecture established a steel transfer "satellite" command, with more than 1,600 cadres from the entire prefecture participating in organizing and directing the transfer, repairing roads, and organizing manpower and vehicles to prepare in all aspects. The transportation army of Mengjin County proposed: "No matter how muddy the road, no matter how slippery the road, we will not dismount until the task is completed." The masses were extremely enthusiastic. Luoyang Transportation Company proposed the slogan of driving 550 to 600 kilometers per day, more than twice the normal driving distance, and the truck drivers responded to the call, fighting day and night. Cadres from the directly affiliated organizations of the Prefectural Committee and students from schools also formed a unloading team of more than 1,300 people, undertaking all the unloading tasks at Luoyang Railway Station and creating a new record of unloading a truck of pig iron in five minutes. All railway stations along the Longhai Railway within Luoyang Prefecture regarded the transfer of pig iron as the most important task to be completed, organized dedicated teams of workers to load and unload pig iron, unloading and loading as soon as it arrived, ensuring the smooth progress of the iron transfer work. Currently, the mass iron transfer movement in Luoyang Prefecture is continuing to develop.

According to Guangxi Daily, the people of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are doing everything possible to transfer pig iron to support Shanghai's steelmaking. Now, all localities are using various means of transportation to gradually collect the first batch of good iron to be transferred to Shanghai at water and land transportation points. From November 1st to 6:00 PM on the 7th, a total of 15,543 tons of pig iron had been shipped from all parts of the region to Shanghai. Among them, Yulin Prefecture transferred more than 9,770 tons.

To concentrate and ship the first batch of good iron to Shanghai on time, all localities made arrangements based on the spirit of the prefectural and municipal Party committee secretaries' meeting convened by the Regional Party Committee, and then organized forces to carry out a mass transfer work. During the organization of the transfer in Yulin Prefecture, the staff and masses were organized to carry out debates on "Why transfer pig iron to support Shanghai," "Should we support Shanghai," and "How to support Shanghai," which enhanced the understanding of cadres and the masses, and everyone worked hard to support Shanghai's steelmaking. The staff and family members of the Yulin Automobile Repair Factory transported more than 310 tons of pig iron from the factory to Yulin Railway Station in just one day and one night of assault. Bobai County in this area also organized eighteen assault platoons to mobilize the masses and transport more than 1,700 tons of pig iron to the roadside and railway station in six days. Pingnan County collected more than 800 tons of pig iron scattered more than ten miles away to the ports of the Yu River in two days and nights, and loaded them all onto tugboats, completing 102% of the task ahead of schedule. The counties under this area also adopted the methods of "no empty return trips for people, no empty runs for vehicles" and "production on the same day, collection and transportation on the same day, everyone takes action, being both smelting workers and transportation workers," so that the iron transfer and the transportation of raw materials for ironmaking were not delayed, which solved the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity to some extent, and rebuilt and built 269 kilometers of highways. Based on the characteristics of difficult transportation in mountainous areas, Baise Prefecture organized more than 68,000 laborers and more than 12,000 cattle, horses, and wooden carts to participate in the pig iron transfer work. People of all ethnic groups, such as Yao, Miao, and Luo Luo in Bama Yao Autonomous County and Longlin Ethnic Autonomous County, transported pig iron over mountains and ridges. In the transfer of pig iron, all localities also strengthened the acceptance work to ensure the quality of pig iron. The Steel and Transportation Command of the Nanning Prefectural Party Committee, based on the transportation routes of each point, while rationally arranging transportation capacity, sent inspection teams to assist in inspecting the quality of pig iron in various counties.

To load and transport quickly, railway workers, family members, local troops, schools, teachers, students, and residents all participated in the battle. When the Luzhai Railway Station loaded twenty-two cars of pig iron on November 4th, all the staff and family members of the station participated in the loading work before dawn under the leadership of the Party General Branch of the line. The stationmaster and chairman of the trade union moved to the station to stay at twelve o'clock in the night, and Auntie Zeng, the cook in the station's canteen, also ensured that the seven people in the canteen were reduced to two, allowing the other five to spare time to participate in the loading and unloading work.

    河南调运大军车水马龙广西一万五千吨铁兼程启运
    据河南日报消息　11月9日，河南省新乡专区调出生铁一万零四十六吨支援鞍山、天津、北京等地。这些铁经冶金工业部和各调铁单位的人员验收质量全部合格，正装火车启运。
    新乡专区为了放出调铁大“卫星”，各县都建立了调铁办公室，并抽一个县委书记专管调铁工作。原阳县委副书记雷峰同志，亲自带领群众，赶着八十辆马车运铁。各县还通过大鸣大放大辩论，来提高干部、群众对调铁重要意义的认识。武陟县提出：“炼好铁，出好钢，好铁好钢送中央”的响亮口号。中共新乡地委为了及时指导调铁工作，从7日到9日，连续召开县委第一书记电话会议，检查调铁工作，交流调铁工作经验，促进各县调铁工作顺利进行，调铁数字与日俱增。全专区在6日调铁五百一十吨，地委电话会议的第一天就调铁一千六百八十四吨，第二天就调出二千三百六十三吨，第三天即增至一万零四十六吨。完成调铁任务最好的是汤（阴）浚（县）协作区。这个协作区在9日一天，就调出生铁五千五百吨，加上以前调出的已超额8％完成了向中央调铁六千吨的任务。为了把好铁尽快地送到工厂，全专区大力组织运铁工作。安阳、武陟等七个县就组织了二千五百四十七辆马车、一百四十四部汽车投入运铁。
    又讯　洛阳专区10日也调出质量合格的生铁、土钢、废钢铁共一万多吨，即将运往上海支援炼钢。
    这个专区从9日晚开始，从伊洛河边到伏牛山区，全区十万多人成千上万的车辆组成的运输大军，星夜奋战！从洛阳通向各县的公路线上，一串串满载生铁的汽车疾驰，汽车灯光照耀得如同白昼，车马人流，载运着生铁土钢奔向公路线和火车站。
    为了将好铁迅速调运到上海钢厂，11月以来，中共洛阳地委向各县三令五申作好生铁调运工作，6日中共洛阳地委书记王慧智同志在各县县委书记电话会议上，就钢铁外调问题提出了十项措施，并特别强调外调生铁的多少，是衡量检查钢铁生产情况的标准之一。在组织这次大放调铁“卫星”之前，洛阳专区成立了钢铁调运“卫星”指挥部，全区参加组织指挥调运的干部达一千六百多人，整修了道路，组织人力车辆从各方面进行准备工作。孟津县的调运大军提出“泥再大，路再滑，完不成任务不下马”。群众情绪极为高涨。洛阳运输公司提出了汽车日行五百五十公里到六百公里的号召，超过平常行车里程的两倍，汽车司机们响应号召，大战了一昼夜。地委直属机关的干部和学校的学生也组成了一千三百多人的卸车大队，担负起洛阳车站的全部卸车任务，并创造了五分钟卸一汽车生铁的新纪录。洛阳专区境内陇海铁路有关火车站，都将调运生铁作为头等重要的任务来完成，组织了专门装卸生铁的工人队伍，随到、随卸、随装，保证了调铁工作的顺利进行。目前，洛阳专区群众性的调铁运动，正在持续发展。
    据广西日报消息　广西僮族自治区各地各族人民想尽一切办法，调运生铁，支援上海炼钢。现在各地正利用各种运输工具，陆续将首批调运上海的好铁集运到水陆交通运输点。由11月1日至7日下午六时，全区各地已启运上海的生铁共计一万五千零一百四十三吨。其中玉林地区就调运九千七百七十多吨。
    为了按时将首批调运的好铁集中与启运至上海，各地根据区党委召开的地、市委书记会议精神，进行了布置，随即组织力量，开展了群众性的调运工作。玉林地区在组织调运中，组织职工、群众开展了“为什么要调运生铁支援上海”，“要不要支援上海”与“怎样支援上海”的辩论，提高了干部和群众的认识，人人为支援上海炼钢而努力。玉林汽车保修厂全厂职工和家属，仅一天一夜的突击就把厂内三百一十多吨生铁运到了玉林火车站。这个地区的博白县也组织了十八个突击排，带动群众，以六天时间把一千七百多吨生铁运到公路旁和火车站，平南县在两昼夜内就将分散在十里以外的八百多吨生铁集运到郁江各港口，并全部装上拖驳船，提前完成任务的102％。这个地区所属各县还采用了“人无回空路、车无放空跑”与“当天生产、当天集运，人人动手，既是冶炼工人又是运输工人”的办法，使生铁调运与炼铁原材料的运输工作两不误，解决了部分运力不足的困难，并改建和修筑了二百六十九公里的公路。百色地区根据山区交通运输困难的特点，组织了六万八千多劳动力和一万二千多牛马驮、木车参加了生铁调运工作。巴马瑶族自治县与隆林各族自治县的瑶、苗、倮倮等各族人民，翻山越岭将生铁运出来。在调运生铁中，各地还加强了验收工作，保证了生铁的质量。南宁地委钢铁、交通指挥部根据各点运输路线，在合理安排运力的同时，派出了检验组、检查组分赴各县协助检验生铁质量。
    为了快装快运，各地铁路职工、家属与地方部队、学校、师生、居民也都参加了战斗。鹿寨火车站在11月4日装运二十二车生铁时，全站职工、家属在线路党总支的领导下天还未亮就参加了装车工作，站长和工会主席在深夜十二点就搬到车站住宿，车站大伙房的炊事员曾老大娘也保证将伙房的七个人减为两个人，让其他五个人抽出身来参加装运工作。
