Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 14th: Japanese Socialist Party Secretary-General Inajiro Asanuma and other leading cadres lodged protests this afternoon with the relevant authorities of the Kishida Nobusuke government, including the National Railway Corporation, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, as well as the Public Prosecutor's Office, the National Police Agency, and the Metropolitan Police Department. The protests concerned the illegal suppression of trade unions that participated in the joint struggle on November 5th.

Since trade unions in various sectors of Japan conducted an unprecedented joint struggle on November 5th against the Kishida Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," relevant departments of the Kishida Nobusuke government have continuously imposed illegal sanctions on workers and illegally searched the offices of trade unions and the residences of trade union leaders.

These suppressive activities are still ongoing. Today, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department conducted its fifth search of the All-Agricultural and Forestry Ministry Workers' Union. The police, citing the union's participation in the joint struggle against the revision of the Police Law as a violation of the "National Public Service Law," searched the headquarters of the All-Agricultural and Forestry Ministry Workers' Union and the office of the Joint Struggle Council of National Public Employees' Unions.

    岸政府非法镇压工人
    日本社会党提出抗议
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎等领导干部，今天下午分别向岸信介政府国营铁道公司、邮政省、农林省等各有关当局和检察厅、警察厅、警视厅提出抗议，抗议它们非法镇压曾经参加11月5日联合斗争的工会。
    自从日本各行业工人在11月5日进行了规模空前的反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的联合斗争以后，岸信介政府各有关部门就一直不断地非法处分工人，并且非法搜查各工会的办事处和工会领导干部的住宅。
    这种镇压活动目前还在继续进行。东京警视厅今天就对全农林省工会进行了第五次搜查，警察借口这个工会参加反对修改警察法的联合斗争违反“国家公务员法”，分别搜查了全农林省工会总部和国家公务员工会共同斗争会议的办事处。
