	“Quick and Good Improvement”
	The delightful autumn sees changes for the better every day. People excitedly joke, "Haha! I'm afraid our threshing ground won't be able to hold it all this year!"

	The only flaw was a patch of corn in Team Ten, which wasn't growing vigorously enough. The old folks lamented, "What a pity! A thousand good things, ten thousand good things, but the topdressing just isn't keeping up!"

	Communist Youth League member Zhao Dahu had just returned from the high-yield field when he overheard this. He immediately said urgently, "Look at our director, what's he doing! This suggestion was made yesterday, but he..." Before he could finish, he turned and ran. In an instant, he returned, holding a big-character poster, the ink still wet, on which was written:

		The corn is starving, quickly transport fertilizer!
		Everyone made suggestions, the director didn't listen.
		Post a big-character poster, unafraid of your bureaucracy.
		If you don't improve quickly, we'll hold you accountable for the reduced yield!

	At this moment, the branch secretary, Old Wang, returned from inspecting the fields. He laughed heartily when he saw it, saying, "Good Dahu! You did right! Taking your time to accept opinions is not a leap forward; you deserve criticism." Before he finished speaking, a rubber-wheeled cart turned out of the alley to the west. The person pushing the cart had feet covered in mud and was soaked to the skin, but a raincoat was covering the load on the cart. This person was none other than the director. It turned out that the director had heard this suggestion yesterday and had braved the strong winds to go to the district cooperative to load chemical fertilizer. After loading the cart, he rushed back nonstop under the starry sky. Who knew that he would encounter a sudden rainstorm on the way back? He hurried as fast as he could, but in the end, he was still a bit late.

	When Dahu learned the truth, his eyes immediately filled with respect and joy. He looked at the director, leaped up, and reached out to tear down the big-character poster he had just posted. When the director saw this, he quickly smiled and dissuaded him, "Dahu! Your criticism is good. Although I listened to the opinion, I was still late. The big-character poster should still be posted."

	Dahu's eyes darted around, and he had an idea. He turned and ran again. In an instant, he wrote another big-character poster, the ink still fresh, on which was written:

		The fertilizer has arrived, the corn is saved!
		As long as the opinion is right, improvement is quick and good.
		With our good director, high yield is guaranteed.
		Our great satellite is about to go into the sky!

	The two big-character posters, tightly pressed together, the ink not yet dry, but the problem had already been solved.

### “改得快又好”

    “改得快又好”
    喜煞人的秋天，一天一个成色。人们兴奋地打趣着：“哈哈！今年只怕咱场院里盛不下哩！”
    美中不足的是十队的一块玉米，长劲不足。老人们感叹说：“可惜呵！一千个好，一万个好，就是追肥跟不上趟了！”
    共青团员赵大虎刚从丰产田回来，正好听见，便急刺刺的道：“看咱社长，怎么搞的！这个意见昨天就提了，可是他……”话没说完，扭头就跑。霎时回来了，手里拿着一张大字报，墨迹未干，上写着：玉米饿坏了，赶快运肥料！大家提意见，社长没听到。贴张大字报，不怕你官僚。要再不快改，减产向你要！
    这时社支部书记老王从田间检查回来，看了乐哈哈的道：“好大虎！干的对！接受意见慢悠悠的，不跃进，就该挨批评。”话音未落，又从西边胡同口拐过一辆胶轮小车。推车的人，两只脚成了泥团，身上水漉漉的，有件蓑衣却盖在车上。此人正是社长。原来，社长昨天听了这个意见，连夜冒着大风到区社装化肥去了。装好车，顶着星星一刻不停往回急赶。谁知回来的路上碰上了一阵急雨，紧赶慢赶，结果还是回来的迟了些。
    大虎知道了究竟，眼睛里立时充满了尊敬和喜悦。他看了看社长，就地一跃，伸手想把刚刚贴上的大字报揭下来。社长一见，连忙笑嘻嘻地劝阻道：“大虎！你批评的好，虽说我听取了意见，但还是来迟了，大字报还是该贴的。”
    大虎眼珠一转，计上心来，扭头又跑。霎时，又写来一张大字报，墨迹鲜明，上写着：
    化肥运来了，玉米得救了！只要意见对，改得快又好。有咱好社长，丰产没有跑。咱的大卫星，快要上天了！
    两张大字报，紧紧地靠在一起，墨迹都还没干，可是问题已经解决了。
