    Give Play to the Superiority of the People's Commune
    Sichuan Accelerates the Development of Cash Crops

    (By our reporter) The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held two telephone conferences on the 3rd and 4th of this month, calling on the people of the entire province to immediately mobilize and concentrate their efforts on achieving large-scale, high-yield production. In 1959, the entire province should make even greater leaps forward in both grain and cash crops.

    The Provincial Party Committee decided that next year, the province will stop cultivating more than ten million mu of high-altitude, cold mountainous land and poor-quality land that currently exists in arable land, and concentrate its efforts on cultivating one hundred million mu of land well. According to the principle of giving equal importance to grain crops and cash crops, of this one hundred million mu of land, sixty million mu will be used to grow grain (a reduction of about one-third compared to this year's area), and forty million mu will be used to grow cash crops and vegetables (an expansion of about one-fold compared to this year). Through intensive cultivation, this one hundred million mu of land is required to produce twice as much grain as this year; greater leaps forward are also required in cash crops such as cotton, rapeseed, ramie, peanuts, sesame, tobacco, medicinal materials, and soybeans.

    The Provincial Party Committee pointed out at the telephone conference that, in order to resolutely implement the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and achieve a greater agricultural harvest in 1959, the entire province should, in accordance with the spirit of "planting less, planting well, and harvesting more," change the past method of extensive planting and thin harvesting, and concentrate the use of manpower and material resources to do a good job in large-scale, high-yield agriculture next year. On the sixty million mu of grain crop land, large-scale yields of 3,000 jin, 5,000 jin, and 10,000 jin per mu are required respectively. For fields with a yield of 10,000 jin per mu, if calculated in two seasons, wheat is required to reach a yield of 3,000 jin per mu, and rice (or other grain crops) is required to reach a yield of 7,000 jin per mu. Large areas of high-yield fields of 10,000 jin per mu should be planted with good fields. In the province, the land planted with grain crops can average one mu per person in the plains area, 1.5 mu per person in the hilly area, and about 2 mu per person in the mountainous area. Of the forty million mu of land planted with cash crops, the rapeseed sowing area should strive to be about five million mu, with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. Greater leaps forward are also required in the yield of other cash crops.

    The conference required that all fields with a yield of 10,000 jin per mu must be deeply plowed twice, deeply cultivated, and have sufficient fertilizer applied; green manure should be promoted in all areas where green manure can be planted.

    The conference emphasized that, in order to victoriously achieve this leap forward task in agricultural production throughout the province next year, all localities must combine the current widely launched communist ideological education movement, conduct full and in-depth ideological mobilization work among cadres at all levels and the masses, further emancipate their minds, boost their energy, and establish firm confidence.

    (By our reporter) Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, has placed the development of cash crops and diversified economy on an important agenda.

    In formulating next year's agricultural production plan, the Neijiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently proposed that, in addition to vigorously carrying out the large-scale high-yield movement and continuing to strive to produce more grain, more arable land will be used to vigorously produce cotton, oil, sugarcane, medicinal materials, poultry, livestock, and various agricultural and sideline products with exchange value, in order to support national economic construction and enrich the material lives of the people. Their slogan is a comprehensive and great development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. The plan arranges for the area planted with grain crops throughout the district next year to be reduced from 80% of the total cultivated land this year to 60%; the area planted with cash crops will increase from 20% this year to 40%. Although the area planted with grain crops has been reduced by more than two million mu, according to the production increase plan, it will still double this year's output, and efforts should be made to produce more fine grains. The production of cash crops and sideline production will develop rapidly. It is estimated that the total output of peanuts next year will increase by four to five times compared to this year, and the total output of rapeseed will increase by nine times. The total output of cotton will increase by one to two times, the total output of sugarcane will increase by one and a half to two times, the number of pigs will increase by three times, the number of small poultry and livestock will increase by five times, and the output of other medicinal materials and various small local specialties will generally be more than double. After the implementation of this plan, not only will it provide more industrial raw materials and export materials for national construction and supply a large number of non-staple foods to cities, but the income of the people throughout the region will also increase significantly, and their lives will be greatly improved. Each person will have 3,000 jin of grain, 60 jin of pork, 30 jin of edible oil, and 48 jin of cotton per year. (Attached pictures)

    发挥人民公社的优越性
    四川加速发展经济作物
    本报讯　中共四川省委在本月3、4两日召开两次电话会议，号召全省人民立即动员起来，集中力量搞好大面积高产，1959年全省在粮食和经济作物两方面都要有一个更大的跃进。
    省委决定，明年全省将把现有耕地中的一千多万亩高寒山地和土质瘠薄的坏地停止耕种，集中力量种好一亿亩土地。根据粮食作物和经济作物并重的方针，这一亿亩地中，以六千万亩种粮食（比今年面积缩小约三分之一），以四千万亩种经济作物和蔬菜（比今年扩大约一倍）。通过精耕细作，要使这一亿亩土地比今年多打两倍产量的粮食；棉花、油菜、苧麻、花生、芝麻、烟草、药材和大豆等经济作物也都要求有更大的跃进。
    省委在电话会议上指出，为了坚决贯彻毛主席和党中央的指示，实现1959年农业更大的丰收，全省应该根据“种的少，种的好，收的多”的精神，改变过去广种薄收的方法，集中使用人力物力，搞好明年农业大面积高产。在六千万亩粮食作物耕地上，要求大面积亩产分别达到三千斤、五千斤和一万斤。亩产一万斤的田地，如以两季计算则要求小麦达到亩产三千斤，水稻
  （或其他粮食作物）亩产达到七千斤。亩产万斤的大面积高产田，应该以好田来种植。全省种植粮食作物的土地，在平坝地区每人可以平均一亩，丘陵地区每人平均一点五亩，山地每人平均二亩左右。在四千万亩种植经济作物的土地中，油菜播种面积要争取有五百万亩左右，亩产达到一千斤。其他经济作物产量上也都要求有更大的跃进。
    会议要求凡是亩产万斤的田，要保证深翻两次，耕深，施足肥料；凡是可以种绿肥的地区，应该提倡多种绿肥。
    会议强调指出，为了胜利地实现全省明年在农业生产上这一跃进任务，各地必须结合当前广泛展开的共产主义思想教育运动，在各级干部和群众中进行充分的、深入的思想动员工作，进一步解放思想，鼓足干劲，树立坚定的信心。

    本报讯　四川内江专区把发展经济作物和多种经济提到重要日程上来。
    中共内江地委最近在制定明年农业生产规划中提出，除了大搞大面积高产运动，继续争取生产更多的粮食外，将拿出更多的耕地大力生产棉花、油料、甘蔗、药材、家禽家畜和各种有交换价值的农副产品，以支援国家经济建设和使人民物质生活丰富多采。他们的口号是农、林、牧、副、渔全面大发展。规划安排全区明年粮食作物种植面积将由今年占总耕地80％减为60％；经济作物种植面积将由今年的20％，上升为40％。粮食作物面积虽然缩小了二百多万亩，但按增产计划仍将比今年翻两番，而且要尽量多生产细粮。经济作物和副业生产将飞跃发展起来，预计明年花生总产量将比今年增加四至五倍，油菜总产量增加九倍。棉花总产量增加一倍到两倍，甘蔗总产量增加一倍半到两倍，毛猪增加三倍，小家禽家畜增加五倍，其他药材和各种小宗土特产一般都在两倍以上。这项规划实现后，不仅能给国家建设提供更多的工业原料和出口物资，向城市供应大量副食品，全区人民收入也将显著增加，生活大改观。每人每年能有粮食三千斤，猪肉六十斤，食油三十斤，棉花四十八斤。（附图片）
