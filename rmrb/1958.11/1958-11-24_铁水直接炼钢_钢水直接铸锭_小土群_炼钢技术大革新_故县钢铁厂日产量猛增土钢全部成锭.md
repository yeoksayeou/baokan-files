Taiyuan Dispatch: (Our Newspaper) Guxian Iron and Steel Plant in Shanxi Province has recently been engaging in a major technological revolution, boldly transforming the steelmaking methods of small indigenous groups. They have successfully adopted three major technological measures, enabling all indigenous steel to be cast into ingots, greatly improving the quality of the steel.

    The three measures are: First, connecting the indigenous iron smelting furnace, small indigenous converter, and ingot mold into a complete set of equipment, enabling the automatic flow of molten iron and steel, and automatic casting. In this way, the daily steel output increased from four to five tons in the past to about ten tons, and the quality improved from being unable to cast ingots to all being cast into ingots, saving twelve man-hours per furnace per day. Second, molten iron from modern blast furnaces no longer undergoes ingot casting and smelting processes but flows directly into steelmaking furnaces, where it is blown into steel and the molten steel "self-flows" into ingots. In this way, the furnace-front workers at the modern blast furnaces have become steelmaking workers, reducing the man-hours per 10,000 tons of steel from 300 in the past to 150. At the same time, it saves a lot of machinery and equipment and coke, and reduces iron loss. Third, using dolomite instead of magnesia to repair furnace linings.

    The three major measures taken by the Guxian Iron and Steel Plant have attracted the attention of China's steel industry. Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and other plants have sent people to the Guxian Iron and Steel Plant to visit and learn. Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gave a high evaluation to these three major measures. He pointed out that the revolutionary significance of these measures is that they have changed the old production organization and the old production process, and changed the past situation of separating iron smelting and steelmaking, thereby greatly increasing steel production.

    When Guxian Iron and Steel Plant was vigorously developing indigenous steelmaking in late September, the masses created three good types of steelmaking furnaces: small indigenous converters, indigenous open-hearth furnaces, and indigenous stir-frying furnaces. However, soon the masses discovered that these furnaces had great shortcomings: they were labor-intensive, and the quality of the steel was poor, generally unable to be cast into ingots. The workers working on the small converters first started to use their brains to find ways to improve. In order to save the process of carrying molten iron and steel and avoid excessive heat dissipation during transportation, which affected the quality, they suggested that the molten iron from the iron smelting furnace should flow directly into the steelmaking furnace, and the molten steel from the steelmaking furnace should flow directly into the ingot mold. This suggestion was supported by the Party Committee Secretary. The Party Committee Secretary also studied and designed the "self-flowing" equipment with the workers. They installed the iron smelting furnace, small converter, and steel ingot mold on three levels of earthen terraces, so that the molten iron and steel no longer needed to be carried by manpower, but could automatically flow into the designated place along the grooves.

    This creation in the field of small indigenous group steelmaking enlightened the workers at the modern blast furnaces. They also researched methods for molten iron from modern blast furnaces to be directly converted into steel and for molten steel to "self-flow" and be cast into ingots. Using this method of steelmaking requires very little equipment. A set of equipment with a daily output of more than 100 tons of steel costs only more than 2,000 yuan. In addition, in response to the shortage of furnace linings after the widespread establishment of steelmaking furnaces, the workers have researched the experience of using dolomite, which is produced in many parts of China, to replace magnesite as furnace lining. After testing, it has been proven that the furnace lining made of dolomite instead of magnesite surpasses the magnesite furnace lining in terms of fire resistance and extending the life of the furnace.

    铁水直接炼钢　钢水直接铸锭
    “小土群”炼钢技术大革新
    故县钢铁厂日产量猛增土钢全部成锭
    本报太原23日电　山西故县钢铁厂职工最近大搞技术革命，大胆改造小土群的炼钢方法，成功地采用了三项重大的技术措施，使土钢全部成锭，大大提高了钢的质量。
    这三项措施是：第一，把土化铁炉、小土转炉和铸锭模三级设备连成套，使铁水钢水自动流、自动铸。这样，就使钢的日产量由过去四、五吨提高到十吨左右，质量由不能铸锭提高到全部成锭，每炉每天还节省了十二个人工。第二，洋高炉铁水不再经过铸锭、熔炼过程就直接流进炼钢炉，吹炼成钢和钢水“自流”成锭。这样，就使过去高炉上的炉前工人变成了炼钢工人，每炼一万吨钢由过去三百个人工减少到一百五十个人工。同时，还节省了许多机器设备和焦炭，减低了铁的损耗。第三，采用白云石代替镁砂补炉衬。
    故县钢铁厂采取的这三项重大措施，引起了我国钢铁界的重视。鞍钢、武钢等都派人到故县钢铁厂参观学习。中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳对这三项重大措施给予很高的评价。他指出，这些措施的革命意义，是改变了旧的生产组织和旧的生产过程，改变了过去炼铁和炼钢割裂的情况，从而大大提高了钢铁生产。
    故县钢铁厂在9月下旬大搞土法炼钢的时候，群众创造了小土转炉、土平炉和土炒炉等三种好的炼钢炉。但是不久，群众就发现这些炉子有很大缺点：费工多，钢的质量不好，一般都不能浇铸成锭。在小转炉上工作的职工首先动脑筋想办法改进。为了省掉抬运铁水、钢水的工序，避免抬运过程中散温过多，影响质量，他们建议使化铁炉化出的铁水直接流进炼钢炉，炼钢炉炼好的钢水直接流进铸锭模。这项建议得到了党委书记的支持。党委书记还同工人们一起研究和设计了“自流”的设备。他们把化铁炉、小转炉和钢锭模分别安装在三级土台阶上，这样铁水和钢水就再不用人力来抬搬，而能顺着沟槽自动流入指定的地方。
    小土群炼钢方面的这一创造，启发了洋高炉上的工人。他们也研究出洋高炉铁水直接炼钢和钢水“自流”铸锭的办法。用这种方法炼钢，需要设备很少，一套日产一百多吨钢的设备，只用两千多元。此外，工人们针对炼钢炉遍地开花以后炉衬缺乏的情况，研究出用我国许多地方都出产的白云石代替镁砂做炉衬的经验。他们用白云石代替镁砂做的炉衬，经过试验证明，在耐火度和延长炉子寿命方面，都超过了镁砂炉衬。
