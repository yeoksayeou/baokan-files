Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 31st. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a symposium on employee education in mid-October to conduct a preliminary summary of the city's employee education work since the Great Leap Forward and to discuss important issues such as further developing employee education and vigorously promoting teaching reforms. The meeting was attended by responsible cadres from the municipal, district, and grassroots levels of the Party committee and administrative departments in charge of education and industrial production, as well as some principals of employee schools. At the meeting, He Qijun, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau, made a speech on the city's employee education work in the past stage and future arrangements. Wang Kangzhi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. Lin Feng, Director of the Second Office of the State Council, who was inspecting education work in Tianjin, also attended the symposium and gave important instructions.

Since the spring of this year, Tianjin's employee education work has made great progress. A total of 280,000 young and middle-aged people have been lifted out of illiteracy, bringing the number of non-illiterate young and middle-aged people to 92%. Various spare-time schools have developed to 1,402, with more than 420,000 students, an increase of 160% compared with the spring of this year. While developing spare-time education, the city has piloted 106 employee part-work, part-study schools, with 24,500 students, of which 10 factories have implemented part-work, part-study for all employees.

The Great Leap Forward in employee education in Tianjin occurred simultaneously with the Great Leap Forward in production. The phenomenon of detachment from politics, detachment from production, and detachment from reality in employee education in the past has been changed, and education has begun to play an active role in promoting production. A large number of employees entered various schools in a timely manner after becoming literate. Some districts, under the slogan of "universal enrollment," enrolled 90% of young and middle-aged people. Some factories have initially established their own education systems. The enthusiasm of the vast number of employees for learning is unprecedentedly high, which is a new atmosphere. The symposium unanimously agreed that the fundamental reasons for achieving the above achievements are: under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, the method of having the secretary take the lead, assigning responsibility at all levels, close cooperation between industrial and educational departments, comprehensive arrangements, and fully mobilizing the masses was implemented, and the policy of education serving politics and serving production was implemented.

According to the situation reflected in the comprehensive symposium, the forms of employee education in Tianjin are diverse. In spare-time schools, a large number of preparatory classes for senior elementary schools have been set up to meet the requirements of employees who have just emerged from illiteracy. In order to meet the needs of employees to improve their scientific and technical knowledge, a number of research classes and 55 spare-time universities have been established. Among them, Xinhua University and spare-time correspondence broadcasting universities have relatively complete departments and are very popular among employees. The forms of part-work, part-study that have appeared are: (1) factories run part-work, part-study schools for their own employees; (2) factories recruit primary and secondary school graduates and implement part-work, part-study; (3) factories and ordinary middle schools merge, and part-work, part-study is implemented among students and some young workers; (4) members of street residents' production service cooperatives implement part-work, part-study. These part-work, part-study schools either focus on learning technical knowledge or mainly learn cultural basic knowledge, and there are various arrangements for learning and production time. There are two-six system, four-four system, one-seven system, etc.

The meeting conducted extensive discussions on whether employee education can be vigorously promoted while production is making a Great Leap Forward. Liu Jianmin, Secretary of the Nankai District Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Ruisheng, Minister of the Industrial Department of the District Committee, Zhang Zhongnan, Secretary of the General Branch of Chunhe Weaving Factory, and Cui Boye, Vice Principal of the Eighty-Second Middle School and Deputy Director of the Bicycle Factory, used specific examples at the meeting to powerfully illustrate that education and production can achieve a double leap forward. As long as we conscientiously act in accordance with the Party's policy, education can become a force to promote production. Nankai District is one of the districts in Tianjin with the fastest development of employee education. In August and September, they vigorously promoted "universal enrollment" and vigorously ran part-work, part-study, and the production was still completed higher than in the past. After the Chunhe, Tonghua, and Sailcloth factories implemented part-work, part-study throughout the factory, the daily output of weaving increased and the cost decreased. The Chunhe Weaving Factory also transferred 70 laborers to support other factories. The merger of the Eighty-Second Middle School and the Bicycle Factory supplemented the factory's labor force, helped production, and also improved the quality of education. The Spare-time Xinhua University in Heping District organized dozens of young people from society to study and arranged their production and work. These facts refuted the view that education cannot be vigorously promoted during the production leap forward and reduced the concerns of some units that vigorously promoting education may affect production.

The symposium believed that running employee education well is to improve the political, cultural, and technical level of employees, accelerate socialist construction, and also prepare conditions for the transition to communism. Therefore, it is necessary to do a good job in political and ideological work, fully mobilize the masses, and solve the problems in the process of running education through extensive airing of views, debates and discussions.

Wang Kangzhi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out in his speech at the symposium: The combination of education and production is a policy that the Party has already determined. The Party committee should make comprehensive arrangements for production and education. The responsible comrades of the factory should grasp both production and education. He said that production is very important, it is the material basis; developing education is also important, it is one of the important conditions for the transition to communism. In the past six months, Tianjin's employee education has achieved great results, but the future tasks are still very heavy. The employees who have just emerged from illiteracy must consolidate and improve. The spare-time schools and part-work, part-study schools that have already been established must be further improved. Spare-time schools should be vigorously developed, and part-work, part-study should be further developed. Employees who have not yet enrolled should be organized to enroll. Wang Kangzhi requested that all departments and units pay attention to summarizing and promoting experience and study and arrange for important issues such as teaching reform.

In his speech, Lin Feng put forward opinions on the issue of launching mass movements and running employee education well. He first analyzed the tremendous and profound changes that have taken place on my country's education front in the past year under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. He said that due to the leap forward development of education, it is rapidly changing the backward cultural situation in our country. Our country has changed from a majority of people being illiterate to a majority of people not being illiterate; from a majority of school-age children not being able to enroll to more than 93% of school-age children being enrolled; the working class and peasant masses who were originally isolated from education have entered various levels and types of schools in large numbers to receive education; this is a fundamental change and an important symbol of the advent of a cultural revolution upsurge. Now, production has exceeded the scope of production departments, and schools, institutions, troops, and streets are running factories and farms on a large scale and engaging in production on a large scale; education has exceeded the scope of schools, and factories, communes, institutions, troops, and streets are running education on a large scale. Education and production have gradually been combined and unified. The object of education is no longer limited to children and young people, but includes all members of society. Education work is not only a matter for the education department, but a matter for all departments. This is completely a new situation. The emergence of this new situation requires comrades in the production department and the education department, first of all leading comrades, to keep up with it ideologically and in their work. Do not simply regard running employee education as a matter of "reading and literacy," but actively prepare conditions for accelerating socialist construction and for the transition to communism, and realize Chairman Mao's teachings as soon as possible: intellectuals becoming workers and peasants, and workers and peasants becoming intellectuals; everyone producing, everyone learning. He believes that Tianjin has achieved results in employee education and has accumulated a lot of experience. He hopes to make greater achievements in the future.

Lin Feng said: The Central Committee proposed to popularize higher education in about fifteen years, which is a great task of cultural revolution. Judging from the current cultural and educational situation of employees across the country and in Tianjin, in order to achieve this task, it is necessary to correctly handle the issue of popularization and improvement. We must regard large-scale popularization as the primary task, popularize and improve at the same time; gradually improve on the existing basis, and combine popularization and improvement. To this end, schools should be widely established in all units with conditions to organize employees to enroll. He pointed out that in the process of large-scale development and popularization, it is necessary to prevent the tendency of requiring too high teaching standards and requiring uniformity. The level and form of employee education can be "three grades and nine levels, diverse and varied." Do not be afraid of too much, do not be afraid of "chaos," and do not use the framework of ordinary schools to restrict the masses. We must realize that there can be high only if there is low; learning more is better than learning less, and learning less is better than not learning at all; the level is not uniform now, but it will be uniform in the future. He said that some intellectuals often underestimate the production knowledge and learning ability of workers and peasants, and comrades engaged in education work must prevent this ideological tendency.

Regarding the issue of spare-time education and part-work, part-study, Lin Feng pointed out: The trial implementation in Tianjin and other places proves that part-work, part-study is an important method for realizing technical revolution and cultural revolution. In the future, with the development of society, it must be continuously expanded. However, at present, spare-time education is still the main form. In the future period, we must promote both spare-time education and part-work, part-study, vigorously develop and run spare-time education well, and actively pilot part-work, part-study, accumulate experience, and gradually promote it.

Lin Feng emphasized that employee education must serve politics and serve production, so that education becomes a force to promote production. All comrades who run employee education should be concerned about production and learn production knowledge. We must thoroughly carry out teaching reform, carry out a major revolution in teaching, and overcome the shortcomings and errors of detachment from politics, detachment from production, and detachment from reality. We must mobilize the masses, break superstitions, make major breakthroughs and establish new ones, and not be afraid of breaking the original "system." The guiding ideology of teaching reform in employee education should be: starting from reality, closely combining with production needs and the characteristics of adults, combining politics, technology, and culture, and combining current needs with preparation for improvement. The production tasks of factories are often tight, so we must find a way to "combine work and study." Lin Feng also put forward some opinions on the reform of curriculum, teaching materials, academic system, and teaching methods. Regarding the issue of teachers, he said that we should strengthen the transformation and improvement of existing teachers, establish a system for teachers to participate in productive labor, so that they can learn production knowledge, improve teaching methods, improve relations with workers, and teach and learn from each other. We must vigorously train new teachers, plan to select excellent workers for training, so that they become the backbone of the teaching staff.

Comrade Lin Feng finally said: Running employee education and carrying out cultural revolution is a large-scale mass movement. Under the leadership of the Party, we must fully mobilize the masses and make them truly the masters of culture through their conscious actions. To mobilize the masses to enroll in school, we must launch a large-scale mass movement; to carry out teaching reform, we must also launch a large-scale mass movement. He believes that strengthening the Party committee's leadership over employee education, closely combining with production, and fully mobilizing the masses are the guarantees for doing this work well.

    为政治服务　为生产服务
    天津职工教育会议高树职工教育红旗
    林枫同志对职工教育工作作了重要指示
    新华社天津31日电　中共天津市委员会于10月中旬召开了职工教育工作座谈会，对大跃进以来全市职工教育工作做了初步总结，对今后进一步发展职工教育和大搞教学改革等重要问题进行了讨论。参加会议的有市、区、基层三级党委和行政主管教育工作和工业生产的负责干部，以及部分职工学校的校长。会上，天津市教育局局长何启君对全市过去一个阶段的职工教育工作和今后的部署做了发言，中共天津市委书记处书记王亢之在会上讲了话，正在天津市视察教育工作的国务院第二办公室主任林枫，也出席了座谈会，并作了重要的指示。
    今年春季以来，天津市职工教育工作有了很大的发展。共扫除青壮年文盲二十八万人，使青壮年中非文盲人数达到92％。各种业余学校已发展到一千四百零二所，学员四十二万余人，较今年春季增加160％。在发展业余教育的同时，全市试办了职工半工半读学校一百零六所，学员二万四千五百人，其中有十个工厂实行了全体职工的半工半读。
    天津市职工教育的大跃进，是在生产大跃进的同时出现的。过去职工教育中脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的现象已经有了改变，教育开始在推进生产上起着积极的作用。大量职工扫盲后及时进入了各种学校，有的区在“全民入学”的口号下，青壮年90％入了学，有些工厂已初步建立起自己的教育体系，广大职工学习情绪空前高涨，这是一种新的气象。座谈会一致认为，取得上述成绩的根本原因是：在市委领导下，实行了书记挂帅，层层负责，工业部门和教育部门密切协作，全面安排，充分发动群众的办法，贯彻了教育为政治、为生产服务的方针。
    综合座谈会反映的情况，天津市职工教育的形式是多种多样的。在业余学校中，为了适应刚脱离文盲状态的职工的要求，设立了大量的高小预备班。为了满足职工提高科学技术知识的要求，已设立了若干研究班和五十五所业余大学，其中新华大学和业余函授广播大学，系科设置相当完备，职工颇为欢迎。半工半读已出现的形式有：（1）工厂自办以本厂职工为对象的半工半读学校；（2）工厂招收中小学毕业生，实行半工半读；（3）工厂与普通中学合并后，在学生和部分青年工人中实行半工半读；（4）街道居民生产服务社社员实行半工半读。这些半工半读学校，有偏重学习技术知识的，也有主要学习文化基础知识的，学习和生产时间的安排办法，也有多种。有二六制，四四制、一七制等。
    对于在生产大跃进的同时，能不能大办职工教育的问题，会议进行了较多的讨论。中共南开区区委书记刘建民和区委工业部部长刘锐生，春和织布厂总支书记张中南，八十二中副校长兼自行车厂副厂长崔伯野等在会上用具体的事例有力地说明了教育、生产是能够双跃进的，只要认真按党的方针办事，教育就可以成为推动生产的力量，南开区是天津市职工教育发展最快的一个区，八、九月份他们大搞“全民入学”，大办半工半读，生产还完成得比过去高。春和、同华、帆布等厂，全厂实行半工半读后，织布的日产量提高了，成本降低了，春和织布厂还抽出了七十名劳动力支援外厂。八十二中和自行车厂合并，补充了工厂的劳动力，帮助了生产，也提高了教育质量。和平区业余新华大学，对几十名社会青年，从组织学习发展到安排他们的生产和工作。这些事实反驳了认为生产跃进中不能大办教育的看法，减少了某些单位认为大办教育可能影响生产的顾虑。
    座谈会认为：办好职工教育，是为了提高职工政治、文化、技术水平，加快社会主义建设，也是为了过渡到共产主义准备条件。因此，必须做好政治思想工作，充分发动群众，对于办教育过程中的问题，要通过大鸣大放，大争大辩加以解决。
    中共天津市委书记处书记王亢之在座谈会上讲话中指出：教育和生产相结合，是党已经确定了的方针。党委应该对生产和教育进行全面安排。工厂的负责同志要把生产和教育都抓起来。他说，生产很重要，是物质基础；发展教育也重要，是过渡到共产主义的重要条件之一。半年多来，天津市职工教育的成绩是很大的，但今后的任务还很重。刚脱离文盲状态的职工，必须巩固提高。已经办起来的业余学校和半工半读学校，必须进一步办好。业余学校要大力发展，半工半读还应再发展一部分。尚未入学的职工要设法组织入学。王亢之要求各部门、各单位都要注意总结和推广经验，对教学改革等重要问题加以研究安排。
    林枫在讲话中对大搞群众运动，办好职工教育问题提出了意见。他首先分析了一年来在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，我国教育战线上所发生的巨大的深刻的变化。他说，由于教育事业的飞跃发展，正在迅速地改变着我国文化落后的状况。我国已经由多数人是文盲变为多数人不是文盲；由多数学龄儿童不能入学变为93％以上的学龄儿童入了学；原来和教育隔绝的工农劳动群众大量地进入了各级各类学校受教育；这是一个根本性的转变，是文化革命高潮到来的一个重要标志。现在，生产已经超出了生产部门的范围，学校、机关、部队、街道都在大办工厂、农场，大搞生产；教育已经超出了学校的范围，工厂、公社、机关、部队、街道都在大办教育。教育和生产已经逐步地结合起来、统一起来了。教育的对象，不再局限于儿童和青年，而是包括社会的一切成员。教育工作不仅仅是教育部门的事，而是一切部门的事。这完全是一种新的形势。这个新形势的出现，要求生产部门和教育部门的同志，首先是领导同志，在思想上、工作上要紧紧跟上。不要把办职工教育单纯看作是“念书识字”的问题，而是为加速社会主义建设，为过渡到共产主义积极准备条件，早日实现毛主席所教导的：知识分子工农化，工农群众知识化；人人生产，人人学习的局面。他认为，天津市在职工教育方面是有成绩的，积累了很多的经验，希望今后作出更大的成绩来。
    林枫说：中央提出以十五年左右的时间来普及高等教育，是个伟大的文化革命的任务。根据全国和天津市职工目前的文化教育情况看，要实现这个任务，必须正确地处理普及和提高问题。要把大量普及作为首要任务，边普及，边提高；在已有的基础上逐步提高，把普及和提高结合起来。为此，要在一切有条件的单位广泛设立学校，组织职工入学。他指出：在大发展大普及中，必须防止对教学水平要求过高、要求整齐划一的倾向。职工教育的水平和形式，可以“三等九级，多种多样”。不要怕多，不要怕“乱”，不要用普通学校的框框去束缚群众。必须认识：有低才能有高；多学比少学好，少学比不学好；现在水平不齐，将来会齐。他说，有些知识分子对工农群众的生产知识和学习能力常常估计不足，作教育工作的同志一定要防止这种思想倾向。
    关于业余教育和半工半读问题，林枫指出：天津和各地试办的情况证明，半工半读是实现技术革命和文化革命的一种重要方法。今后随着社会的发展，必须不断扩大。但是在当前，业余教育还是大量的。在今后一个时期内，必须业余教育和半工半读并举，既要大力发展和办好业余教育，又要积极试办半工半读，积累经验，逐步推广。
    林枫强调指出：职工教育必须为政治服务，为生产服务，使教育成为推动生产的力量。一切办职工教育的同志都应该关心生产，学习生产知识。必须彻底地进行教学改革，在教学上来一个大革命，克服脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的缺点和错误。要发动群众，破除迷信，大破大立，不要怕打破了原来的“体系”。职工教育教学改革的指导思想应该是：从实际出发，密切结合生产需要和成人特点，使政治、技术、文化相结合，使当前需要和准备提高相结合。工厂的生产任务经常是紧张的，要找出“工读结合”的办法。林枫对课程、教材、学制、教学方法的改革问题也提出了一些意见。关于师资问题，他说，应该对现有教师加强改造提高，建立教师参加生产劳动的制度，使他们学习生产知识，改进教学方法，改进和工人的关系，和工人互教互学。要大力培养新师资，有计划地挑选优秀的工人进行培养，使他们成为教师队伍的骨干。
    林枫同志最后说：办职工教育，搞文化革命，是一个大规模的群众运动。必须在党的领导下，充分发动群众，通过群众的自觉行动，使他们真正成为文化的主人。发动群众入学，必须大搞群众运动；进行教学改革，也必须大搞群众运动。他认为，加强党委对职工教育的领导，密切结合生产，充分发动群众，是做好这项工作的保证。
