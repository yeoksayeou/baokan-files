Steelmaking and People-Making: Youth Charge Ahead
36 Million Youths Tempered into Steel Warriors

(Our dispatch) "Resolutely respond to the Party's call and be sure to achieve 10.7 million tons of steel!" Youths across the country have made a magnificent vow to realize the great task of doubling steel production. In the two months since the start of the great steel battle, approximately 36 million young people have participated, accounting for about 60% of the total. According to statistics from seventeen provinces (regions) and cities including Sichuan, Guangxi, Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Guizhou, there are more than 371,000 youth steelmaking and ironmaking furnaces named by local Party committees. Many young people stated during steelmaking: "For steel, wherever the Party needs me, I will go." When there was an urgent need for ore to ensure the steel "marshal" was well-fed, young people in Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong, and Henan provinces organized more than 40,000 mining and prospecting teams, braving hardships to collect ore in the deep mountains and dense forests, carrying dry rations. The footprints of youth expedition teams from Baotou and other provinces were all over Baiyun Mountain, Boshan Mountain, Funiu Mountain, Tongbai Mountain, and Taihang Mountain.

As quality issues have become the most important problem in steel production, the youth have not hesitated to actively participate in the struggle to improve the quality of steel. Youths in Shanxi, Henan, Hunan, Shanghai and other places have actively marched toward the great improvement of steel quality in response to the Party committee's call to "make good iron and good steel." In order to expand steel production, the broad masses of young people have also warmly responded to the Party's call to establish new steel bases. Nearly one million young people in provinces and cities such as Henan, Guizhou, Hubei, and Beijing have organized countless armies to enter the mountains and go on expeditions to mining areas to participate in the construction of steel bases.

In order to strive for "more steel, faster steel, and better steel," the youth have launched a communist competition upsurge of "you catch up with me, and I catch up with you" throughout the country. Key steel plants such as Shanghai Steel, Anshan Steel, Chongqing Steel, and Taiyuan Steel, as well as countless indigenous furnaces across the country, have actively joined the competition. In this competition, the youth competed with each other, displayed their skills, and repeatedly broke records, increasing the production of a large amount of steel for the country. After Dalian Steel Plant's Youth No. 2 furnace achieved a utilization coefficient of 82.90 tons on the 9th, winning the glorious title of "Red Flag Youth Furnace," the youth of the entire furnace, with the revolutionary spirit of "mountains are high, clouds are high, the sky is even higher, our ambition is higher than the sky," released a satellite of 97.774 tons of electric furnace utilization coefficient on the 15th, surpassing Benxi Steel Plant's Satellite No. 1 Youth Furnace and regaining the championship. The Benxi Satellite Furnace, Fushun, Dalian, Anshan, Shenyang and other nine youth electric furnaces are also speeding up to catch up.

On the steel front, the vast majority of young people are new recruits. They studied hard, dared to think and dare to act, and finally created miracles. In Zunyi County, Guizhou, 80,000 young people launched a competition craze to compare technology, learn quickly, learn well, and learn a lot in order to increase the output of indigenous iron, collectively storming technical fortresses. In the past month or so, more than 24,000 young people in the county have mastered various ironmaking technologies, and more than 150 of them have become furnace masters. Cui Zhinian, a young worker at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company’s No. 1 Steel Plant, is an assistant at the No. 5 furnace. This No. 5 furnace was known as the "old ox furnace," and the shortest record for smelting a furnace of steel was eight hours and twenty-five minutes. Seeing that other furnaces were leaping forward, Cui Zhinian was very anxious and determined to change this backward record. So he requested to smelt a furnace of steel himself. The Party branch supported his request. Cui Zhinian, who had never smelted steel before, boldly changed some operating methods with the help of veteran workers, and finally smelted a furnace of steel in six hours and fifty minutes, making the No. 5 furnace leap to become an advanced furnace. In Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places, young people also boldly used old equipment and created miracles that increased the output of a furnace of steel by more than one time.

Under the slogan of "Everything for steel" and "Making steel and making people," touching examples of selflessness and public service have emerged one after another among young people, and communist ideological qualities are constantly growing. In Yantai, people are spreading the moving story of young worker Lü Fengfu's risking his life to rescue a blast furnace. Lü Fengfu is a worker at the Yantai No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant. On September 29, the charging hopper of the No. 29 furnace was off-center, and the furnace body was immediately in danger of being burned out. At this time, Lü Fengfu ran to the furnace without hesitation, risking his life to rescue it. In the end, the furnace was saved, but Lü Fengfu was seriously injured and escaped danger only after emergency treatment. In Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants and Xinhua Steel Plant, young people also took the initiative to help others catch up with themselves; young people in Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel rushed to do heavy work and carried out uncompensated labor, winning the praise of the Party and veteran workers. After being tempered in the steel battle, many young people greatly improved their awareness and gloriously joined the Party and the League on the front lines. (Attached picture)

    炼钢又炼人　青年打冲锋
    三千六百万青年锻炼成为钢铁勇士
    本报讯　“坚决响应党的号召一定要拿下一○七○万吨钢！”全国青年为了实现钢产量翻一番的伟大任务，发出了雄壮的誓言。两个多月以来，参加钢铁大战的青年约有三千六百万人，占总人数的60％左右。据四川、广西、河南、河北、江苏、贵州等十七个省（区）市统计，各地经党委命名为青年炼钢、炼铁炉的，共有三十七万一千多座。很多青年在炼钢中提出：为了钢铁，党需要我到哪里我就到哪里。当各地紧张地需要矿石，保证钢铁元帅吃饱的时候，陕西、甘肃、山东、河南四省青年，就组织起四万多个采矿、查矿队，不畏艰苦地带着干粮到深山密林中去采集矿石。在白云山、博山、伏牛山、桐柏山和太行山上，遍布着来自包头青年远征团和其他各省青年的足迹。
    当目前质量问题成为钢铁生产中的头等重要问题的时候，青年们毫不迟疑地积极参加了提高钢铁质量的斗争。山西、河南、湖南、上海等地青年根据党委提出“炼好铁、炼好钢”的号召，积极向钢铁质量大进军。为了扩大钢的生产，广大青年还热烈响应党关于建立新的钢铁基地的号召。河南、贵州、湖北、北京等省市近百万青年，已经组织了无数大军开入大山和远征到矿区参加钢铁基地的建设。
    青年们为了争取“多出钢，快出钢，出好钢”，在全国掀起了一个“你赶我，我赶你”的共产主义竞赛热潮。上钢、鞍钢、重钢、太钢等重点钢厂，以及全国无数土炉，都积极投入了竞赛。在这个竞赛中，青年们互相比武，各显神通，一再突破纪录，为国家增产了大批钢铁。大连钢厂青年二号炉继9日利用系数达到八二点九○吨，获得“红旗青年炉”的光荣称号后，15日全炉青年又以“山高云高天更高，我们的志气比天高”的革命干劲，再放出电炉利用系数九七点七七四吨卫星，超过本溪钢厂卫星号青年炉，再次夺回冠军。本溪卫星炉、抚顺、大连、鞍山、沈阳等九个青年电炉，也正在快马加鞭赶上去。
    在钢铁战线上，绝大部分青年都是新兵，他们苦钻苦学，敢想敢干，终于创造了奇迹。贵州遵义县八万青年，为了提高土铁产量，掀起了一个比技术，比学得快，学得好，学得多的竞赛热潮，集体猛攻技术堡垒。一个多月以来，全县已有二万四千多名青年掌握了各种炼铁技术，其中一百五十多人当了炉师。鞍钢第一钢铁厂青年工人崔志年是五号炉的助手。这个五号炉被人称为“老牛炉”，炼一炉钢最短的纪录是八点二十五分。崔志年眼看到别的炉子都在跃进，很着急，决心要改变这个落后纪录。于是他请求自己炼一炉钢。党支部支持了他的要求。从来没有炼过钢的崔志年在老工人的帮助下，大胆地改变了一些操作方法，终于用六小时五十分钟炼出了一炉钢，使五号炉一跃而为先进炉。在沈阳、武汉、广州等地，青年们还大胆利用旧设备，创造了使一炉钢增加产量一倍以上的奇迹。
    在“一切为了钢”，“炼钢炼人”的口号下，青年中舍己为公的动人事例层出不穷，共产主义的思想品质在不断成长。在烟台，人们传颂着青年工人吕丰福冒险抢救高炉的动人故事。吕丰福是烟台市第一炼铁厂的工人。9月29日，第二十九号炉的料盅偏了，炉膛立刻有被烧坏的危险。这时吕丰福毫不迟疑地跑到炉上冒着生命危险进行抢救。最后炉子是被保住了，但吕丰福却受了重伤，经过急救后才脱险。在上海第一、第三钢铁厂、新沪钢铁厂，青年们还主动帮助别人赶上自己；包钢、武钢青年抢干重活，开展了不计报酬的劳动，获得党和老工人的赞扬。许多青年经过钢铁战斗的锻炼，觉悟大大提高，光荣地在火线上入了党，入了团。（附图片）
