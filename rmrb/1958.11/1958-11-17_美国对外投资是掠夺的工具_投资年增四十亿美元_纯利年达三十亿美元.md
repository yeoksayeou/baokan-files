U.S. Foreign Investment is a Tool of Plunder
Investment Increases by $4 Billion Annually, Net Profit Reaches $3 Billion Annually

    (Reported by this newspaper) U.S. monopoly capital relies on the means of exporting capital to underdeveloped countries to obtain staggering high profits. According to a report in the "New York Times" on October 27, William McDonnel, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, admitted in a recent speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico that U.S. private investment abroad has reached $37 billion and is growing at a rate of $4 billion per year. He said that the net profit from foreign investment is about $3 billion per year.

    According to materials from "Vision" magazine published in New York on October 24, U.S. private investment in Latin America reached $8.8 billion in 1957, an increase of $1.03 billion over 1956. Most of this was invested in the oil industry, which increased by $900 million in 1957. Last year, U.S. private capital in Latin America earned profits of $915 million, two-thirds of which came from the oil industry.
