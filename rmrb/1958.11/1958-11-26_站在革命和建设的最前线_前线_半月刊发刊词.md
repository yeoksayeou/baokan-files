    Standing on the Forefront of Revolution and Construction
    --Inaugural Statement of "Frontline" Bi-monthly
    "Frontline" is a theoretical publication sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. It will use Mao Zedong Thought, that is, the integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and the spirit of continuous revolution, to guide itself and strive to become a timely ideological weapon for the Beijing Party organization to reflect reality, guide practice, and transform reality.
    "Frontline" must, together with the theoretical publications sponsored by the provincial and municipal Party committees across the country, stand on the forefront of implementing the Party's guidelines, policies, and other instructions from the Central Committee, stand on the forefront of the socialist revolution, stand on the forefront of socialist construction, stand on the forefront of the ideological struggle of Marxism-Leninism, stand on the forefront of the struggle against all kinds of bourgeois ideology and modern revisionism, and stand on the forefront of the struggle against various unhealthy tendencies and evil practices among the people. Always be a promoter, not a middle-of-the-roader, and certainly not a drag. It is not easy to truly achieve this. However, we must do it; it is our duty.
    The Beijing Party organization is closely following Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee. The ideological style of the vast majority of Party members, the mainstream of the Party's ideological style, is upright and healthy. In particular, since the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the nationwide Great Leap Forward, there has been leaping progress. However, a few people do have some very bad tendencies, which hinder the masses from going all out, aiming high, and standing on the forefront of the revolutionary movement. They appear and disappear from time to time, creating disturbances. These are centrism, middle-of-the-roadism, and those who nitpick at mass movements. We must continue to expose and criticize them.
    The characteristics of centrists are that they often have an ambiguous and equivocal attitude between right and wrong, showing "generosity and magnanimity" and trying to please everyone. Even in the face of major issues of principle, on the ideological front of class struggle, they sometimes take a cunning and slick "impartial" and "detached" attitude. They do not adhere to the truth, go all out, distinguish between right and wrong, and distinguish between the enemy and ourselves to stand on the forefront of the movement. Instead, they are determined to always stand in what they consider to be a completely safe haven, that is, in a middle state. What they care most about is not the interests and success or failure of the Party and the people's cause, but establishing popularity and winning "votes" without principle. In fact, such people are protectors of various unhealthy tendencies and evil practices, and allies of Rightists inside and outside the Party. Unfortunately, a very small number of our comrades have also been infected with this anti-Marxist-Leninist philistine and "village worthy" style.
    The characteristics of middle-of-the-roaders are that they do not strive to go upstream, but settle for being in the middle. They are complacent with slight achievements, thinking they are already good enough, and therefore often fall into the downstream. They love the square steps of the rich man on the stage too much, and they are too accustomed to the pace of snails. Therefore, in the face of the high tide of mass revolution and the Great Leap Forward in construction, they are often flustered. They either complain that the Party and the masses' demands are too high, or they complain that they are walking too fast, feeling that this is risky and that is unstable. On the surface, they seem to be Zhuge Liang, who is thoughtful and commanding, but in reality, they are conservatives within the people who cling to the old and stick to conventions. If this ideological style spreads within the Party, the Party will become like an old man with too much calcification in his body, unable to leap forward and even struggling to walk, and his actions will be slow.
    To stand on the forefront of revolution and construction, one must stand "among the masses" and "in the movement," be closely connected with the masses like flesh and blood, and lead the masses to advance together on the basis of their conscious efforts. However, some people not only stand outside the masses and outside the movement, but also often stand above the masses, acting as if they are the masters of the world, and arbitrarily judge the mass movement. They always use a microscope magnified ten thousand times, and according to their imagined "blueprint" of the mass movement, point fingers and nitpick at the mass movement. When they find a little fault, they use the method of "attacking one point without considering the rest," criticize and blame, and pour cold water on the cadres and the masses. They do not study the mass movement in a down-to-earth manner, summarize the experience of the movement, affirm the achievements, correct the shortcomings, and promote the movement forward; instead, they specialize in finding fault, blaming, tying the hands and feet of the masses,打击打击 the spirit of the masses, and hindering the development and deepening of the mass movement. They are actually opponents of the mass revolutionary movement.
    To stand on the forefront of revolution and construction is to maximize subjective initiative based on the Party's guidelines and policies and the objective possibility and necessity, that is, to use the conscious efforts of the Party and the masses to advance our work in all aspects at the highest possible speed objectively and healthily. Here, we must neither be Right-leaning and conservative, nor blindly rush forward based solely on subjective enthusiasm. We must constantly use the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and method to continuously conduct systematic and thorough investigations and studies of the current specific situation. Without a scientific understanding of reality, we have no basis for determining guidelines and policies and establishing determination and confidence, and our guiding work will be unfounded.
    We are dialectical materialists, and we know the actual relationship between our subjective initiative and objective existence and objective laws. Yes, people are the creators of history. We must transform reality—transform society, transform nature. But we cannot act emotionally, cannot act on the "instinct" of a flash of inspiration, cannot act according to fragmentary materials and superficial phenomena, and even more cannot be like kites or hydrogen balloons, drifting with the wind, that is, following the air. In short, we cannot violate objective laws and act arbitrarily. We must, and only must, act in accordance with objective laws in a down-to-earth and honest manner, and transform reality in accordance with objective laws. At the same time, we must adopt a Marxist-Leninist honest attitude towards the achievements and shortcomings in our work, whether we have done it right or wrong, treat them all as objective things, say yes if it is yes, no if it is no, good if it is good, bad if it is bad, many if it is many, few if it is few, and deal with them seriously and cautiously. Therefore, we must consciously and continuously conduct systematic investigations and studies of the current situation, the current trend, the laws of social development, the laws of development of various movements, the situation of struggle full of contradictions, and the ideological, political, and organizational conditions of the constantly changing masses, etc., and summarize the experience of the movement in a timely manner, make it systematic, and elevate it to a theory, so as to guide practice and improve work. At the same time, we are political workers, not historians. Our investigation and research work, our understanding, must be ahead of the movement to transform reality, ahead of the practice of the broad masses. Therefore, we must see the general from the embryonic forms of things, from the typical research of new things, and from the summary of new typical experiences, grasp the key, grasp the mainstream, and explore the laws, directions, and prospects of the development of things, so as to form several concepts that essentially summarize the situation, form scientific political predictions, and use them to guide our own and the masses' practice. Otherwise, standing on the forefront of revolution and construction will become an empty boast, or actually become a follower of tailism who drifts with the tide.
    In the past, the work of our Beijing Party, including the Municipal Committee, in this regard was not done well and had shortcomings. Our investigation and research work, the work of systematizing experience and elevating it to a theory, is not commensurate with the huge amount of practical work we have done, and is lagging behind practical work. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. We want to use the publication of this journal to spur ourselves to improve our work in this area and improve our level of theoretical work and our level of thinking.
    We hope that comrades will work together to run this journal well.

    站在革命和建设的最前线
    ——“前线”半月刊发刊词
    “前线”是中共北京市委主办的理论刊物。它将用毛泽东思想，即马列主义普遍真理跟中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的思想，用不断革命的精神，指导自己，努力使自己成为北京市党的组织及时地反映现实、指导实践、改造现实的思想武器。
    “前线”必须同全国各省、市委主办的理论刊物一道，站在贯彻执行党的方针、政策和中央其他指示的最前线，站在社会主义革命的最前线，站在社会主义建设的最前线，站在马列主义思想斗争的最前线，站在反对各色各样的资产阶级思想和现代修正主义斗争的最前线，站在反对人民内部各种歪风、邪气斗争的最前线。永远作促进派，不要作中间派，当然，更不能作促退派。要真正做到这样，是不容易的。可是，我们必须这样做，这是我们的职责。
    北京市党的组织是紧处在毛泽东同志和党中央的跟前的，绝大多数党员的思想作风，党的思想作风的主流，是正派、健康的。特别是整风、反右和全民大跃进以来，又有飞跃的进步。但是有少数人确实有些很不好的倾向，它是妨害群众鼓足干劲、力争上游地站在革命运动的最前线的。它们时隐时现，兴妖作怪。这就是中庸主义、中游主义和对群众运动的吹毛求疵派。我们必须继续不断地加以揭露和批判。
    中庸主义者的特点是，在是非之间，往往态度暧昧，模棱两可，“雍容大度”，八面讨好。甚至在大是大非面前，在阶级斗争的思想战线上，有时，也贼光油滑地采取“不偏不倚”的折衷、“超然”态度。他们不是坚持真理、鼓足干劲、辨明是非、分清敌我，站在运动的最前线，而是打定主意，总站在他们自以为万全的避风港，即处在中间状态中。他们最关心的，不是什么党和人民的利益和事业的成败，而是无原则地树立人缘，争取“选票”。实际上，这种人是各种歪风，邪气的庇护者，党内外右派的同盟军。可惜我们的极少数同志也传染上这种反马列主义的市侩、“乡原”作风。
    中游主义者的特点是，不力争上游，却安居中游，稍有成就，就沾沾自喜，以为已经差不多了，因此往往沦为下游。他们太喜爱舞台上员外老爷的四方步了，太习惯于蜗牛式的步伐了。因此，他们在群众革命高潮和建设大跃进面前，往往张皇失措，不是嫌党和群众的要求太高，就是嫌走得太急太快，觉得这也冒险，那也不稳。从表面上看，他们好像是深谋熟算、指挥若定的孔明，实际上是人民内部抱残守缺、故步自封的保守派。如果让这种思想作风在党内蔓延起来，党就会变得像体内石灰质过多的老人一样，不但跃进不起来，甚至步履维艰，行动都会迟滞起来。
    要站在革命和建设的最前线，就必须站在“群众之中”和“运动之中”，跟群众血肉相连地打成一片，在群众自觉的基础上，领导群众一同前进。可是，有一部分人，不但站在群众之外，运动之外，而且往往站在群众之上，俨然以世界主宰自居，对群众运动妄自尊大地进行审判。他们老是用上万倍的显微镜，按照他们设想的群众运动“图纸”，指手画脚、吹毛求疵地对群众运动品头评足。抓到一点毛病，就采用“攻其一点不及其余”的手法，指责非难，向干部、群众头上浇冷水。他们不是实事求是地研究群众运动，总结运动的经验，肯定成绩，纠正缺点，推动运动前进；而是专门找碴、责难，捆绑群众的手足，打击群众的锐气，阻挠群众运动的发展和深入。他们实际是群众革命运动的反对派。
    要站在革命和建设的最前线，就是要根据党的方针政策，根据客观实际的可能性和必要性，最大限度发挥主观的能动性，即用党和群众自觉的努力，使我们各方面的工作，以客观上可能的最高的速度，健康地前进。在这里既不能右倾保守，也不能单凭主观的热情，盲目地蛮干。必须经常地用马列主义的观点和方法，对于当前的具体情况，连续地进行系统周密的调查研究。没有对于现实的科学认识，我们就没有确定方针、政策和树立决心、信心的根据，我们的指导工作也就无所根据。
    我们是辩证唯物主义者，我们知道，我们的主观能动性跟客观存在、客观规律的实际关系。是的，人是历史的创造者。我们要改造现实——改造社会，改造自然。可是我们却不能感情用事，不能凭灵机一动的“本能”办事，不能按照片断的材料和表面现象办事，更不能像风筝、氢气球一样，随风飘荡，即跟着空气办事。总之，不能违背客观规律，任意乱干。我们必须，也只有实事求是地、老老实实地按照客观规律办事，按照客观规律改造现实。同时，对于工作中的成绩和缺点，做得对或者不对，必须采取马列主义的老实态度，都当作客观事物对待，是就是、非就非，好就好、坏就坏，多就多、少就少，该怎样就怎样，严肃谨慎地对待。因此，就必须自觉地连续地对于当前的情况、当前的大势，对于社会发展的规律，对于各种运动发展的规律，对于充满着矛盾的斗争形势，对于工作和不断变化着的群众的思想、政治、组织状况等等，进行系统的调查研究，把运动的经验，及时地加以总结，使它条理化，使它上升为理论，用以指导实践，改进工作。同时，我们是政治工作者，不是历史家，我们的调查研究工作，我们的认识，必须走在改造现实运动的前面，走在广大群众实践的前面。因此，我们必须从事物的萌芽形态中，从新鲜事物的典型研究中，从新的典型经验的总结中，看出一般，抓住关键，抓住主流，探索出事物发展的规律、方向和前途，以便形成从本质上概括情况的若干概念，形成科学的政治预见，用来指导自己和群众的实践。否则，所谓站在革命和建设的最前线，就会变成一句豪迈的空话，或者实际上变成随波逐流的尾巴主义者。
    我们北京市的党，包括市委在内，过去在这方面的工作，是做得不够的，是有缺点的。我们的调查研究工作，把经验条理化，使它上升为理论的工作，是跟我们所作的巨大的实际工作不相称的，是落在实际工作的后面的。这种情况，不能让它再继续下去。我们想借这个刊物的出版，鞭策自己改进这方面的工作，提高我们的理论工作水平，提高我们的思想水平。
    我们希望同志们共同努力办好这个刊物。
