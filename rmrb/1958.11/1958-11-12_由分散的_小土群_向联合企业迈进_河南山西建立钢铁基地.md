Henan and Shanxi Establish Steel Bases

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 11th: The mass steelmaking movement in Henan Province has entered a stage of comprehensive consolidation and improvement. Various localities are universally implementing "five-izations" (i.e., furnace grouping, group furnace factoryization, team specialization, production basification, and base people's communalization), so that the province's indigenous steelmaking and ironmaking furnaces are developing into small joint enterprises integrating indigenous and foreign methods, covering steel, iron, coal, refractory materials, and building materials.

As early as September and October, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and party organizations at all levels began to consolidate and improve the "small native group" iron and steelmaking efforts. At that time, various furnace types created by the masses were first identified, and eight excellent ironmaking furnace types and several steelmaking furnace types were selected for promotion throughout the province. Now, the province has formed 2,500 steel and ironmaking furnace groups. These furnace groups are actually the prototypes of iron and steel joint enterprises. In terms of production, there are steelmaking and ironmaking, and some also have forging and coking. In terms of labor organization, specialized teams such as mining, transportation, furnace building, crushing, steelmaking, ironmaking, and repair, as well as various shock brigades, have been established, and key technical personnel have been fixed. In terms of management, factory directors and party committee secretaries have been assigned, functional organizations have been established, workshops or sections and work teams have been divided, accounting books have been established, and a management method of fixed leadership, fixed personnel, fixed tasks, fixed quality, fixed time, and fixed raw materials, as well as a militarized organizational form, has been implemented. Various localities have also separated technical work types and drafted key points of technical operation on the basis of summarizing the production experience of the previous stage, so as to standardize the operation procedures and facilitate production and improve the skills of workers.

The iron and steel joint enterprises in various localities are planned according to the conditions of raw materials, fuel, transportation, water, and electricity. Henan Province has relatively abundant resources and convenient transportation. At present, most of the steel and ironmaking furnace groups formed in the province are close to transportation and raw material producing areas. Now these furnace groups are gradually being improved to become small iron and steel joint enterprises.

This kind of small iron and steel joint enterprise has the following advantages: (1) It is easy to lead and manage, and can quickly improve various technical and economic indicators, increase output and quality. (2) It is easy to promote various advanced experiences and quickly improve the technical level. (3) It is easy to organize continuous production, from ore entering the factory to producing steel, which can reduce transportation and material consumption. (4) The products produced can meet the needs of local people's production and life. (5) It can eliminate the differences between urban and rural areas, realize the close integration of industry and agriculture, and make laborers all-rounders. (6) It is easy to gradually realize technological transformation, making it a modernized small steel plant, and then further expanding and transforming some of them into medium-sized or large-scale steel bases equipped with the latest technology, so that the province will form a reasonable distribution steel base network combining large, medium and small, and equipped with the latest technology.

In order to promote the sound development of the province's iron and steel industry from low to high, from less to more, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is currently vigorously mobilizing the masses to transform and improve the small native groups, and on the other hand, is seizing the basic construction of small group furnaces based on the small native groups according to the specific situation. The mass technical innovation movement currently being carried out in the province will greatly accelerate the mechanization process of "small native group" steelmaking and ironmaking.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 10th: Reporter Fan Yinhuai and Guo Jie reported: Shanxi is adopting the method of concentrated contiguous areas to begin rectifying the scattered and single "small native group" iron and steelmaking base points, and building iron and steel bases combining indigenous and foreign methods. After these iron and steel bases are completed, the province will form an iron and steel base network with large, medium, and small sizes. In addition to the original Yangquan, Changzhi, and Taiyuan becoming large-scale iron and steel bases with an annual steel output of 500,000 to 1 million tons, 14 "small native group" areas such as Jincheng and Puxian will also be transformed into medium and small-sized iron and steel bases with an annual steel output of about 100,000 tons through furnace type transformation and the addition of equipment.

Now, in the spirit of "foreign methods from native methods" and "combining native and foreign methods," various localities have begun to transform native smelting furnaces. Changzhi Prefecture is universally transforming native square furnaces and native blast furnaces, which are labor-intensive and have dispersed wind temperatures, by adopting the method of "grouping furnaces into groups and building furnaces into groups," and fixing special personnel and equipment to implement circulating flow operations in production. In this way, not only the furnace temperature is increased, but also nearly half of the labor force is saved. Taiyuan City, southern Shanxi, and Yuci Prefecture, while transforming native furnaces, are massively adding small foreign blast furnaces of 1.5 cubic meters and 3 cubic meters, and are also massively adding native open-hearth furnaces and small converters for steelmaking to replace the steel stir-frying furnaces that consume too much wood and coal, so as to reduce costs and improve quality. Near the various iron and steel bases, a hot wave of "small native groups" opening coal kilns and massively running refractory material factories and building native railways has also been set off. The province is to restore and build more than 2,000 small coal kilns to provide fuel for the iron and steel bases.

The iron and steel bases that have been rectified have established normal labor order. Each base has formed several fixed labor armies such as mining, smelting, and transportation according to different production tasks. In the key iron and steel bases in Changzhi and southern Shanxi, production management systems and technical operating procedures have begun to be established. Jincheng, Wuxiang, Gaoping, and Huguan counties have also equipped factory directors, party committee secretaries, and necessary production and financial management cadres in various iron and steel joint enterprises, and production has begun to normalize.

    由分散的“小土群”向联合企业迈进
    河南山西建立钢铁基地
    本报郑州11日电　河南省群众性的大办钢铁运动，已经走上全面巩固提高的阶段。各地正在普遍实行“五化”（即炉子成组化、群炉工厂化、队伍专业化、生产基地化和基地人民公社化），使全省的土法炼钢、炼铁炉，发展成为土洋结合的钢、铁、煤炭、耐火材料和建筑材料的小型联合企业。
    早在9、10月间，中共河南省委和各级党组织就开始着手对“小土群”炼铁炼钢进行巩固提高工作。那时首先鉴定了群众创造的各种炉型，从中选出八种优秀的炼铁炉型和几种炼钢炉型在全省推广。现在全省形成了二千五百个炼钢炼铁炉群。这些炉群实际上就是钢铁联合企业的雏型。在生产方面，有炼钢、炼铁，有的还有锻造、炼焦。在劳动组织上都建立了采矿、运输、建炉、粉碎、炼钢、炼铁、修配等专业队和各种突击队，固定了主要技术骨干。在管理方面，配备了厂长和党委书记，建立了职能机构，划分了车间或工段、工作队，建立了会计账目，实行了定领导、定人员、定任务、定质量、定时间、定原料的管理方法和军事化的组织形式。各地并且分别技术工种，在总结前段生产经验的基础上草拟了技术操作要点，使操作规程化，以利于生产和提高工人的技术。
    各地的钢铁联合企业都是根据原料、燃料、交通、水、电等方面的条件来进行规划的。河南省的资源相当丰富，交通四通八达。目前全省已经形成的炼钢、炼铁炉群，绝大部分靠近交通以及原料产地。现在这些炉群正逐步提高，使其成为小型的钢铁联合企业。
    这种小型的钢铁联合企业具有以下优点：（一）便于领导和管理，能够较快地提高各种技术经济指标，提高产量和质量。（二）便于推广各种先进经验，迅速提高技术水平。（三）便于组织连续生产，从矿石进厂后一直到生产出钢材，可以减少运输和物力的耗费。（四）生产的产品能够切合当地人民生产与生活的需要。（五）可以消除城乡之间的差别，实现工农业的密切结合，使劳动者成为多面手。（六）便于逐步实现技术改造。使其成为现代化小型的钢铁厂，再进一步将其中一部分扩建改建成中型或大型的由最新技术装备起来的钢铁基地，使全省形成一个大中小相结合的由最新技术装备起来的合理的分布的钢铁基地网。
    中共河南省委为促使全省钢铁工业由低到高、由少到多、土洋结合的健全发展，目前一方面在大力发动群众进行小土群的改造提高，另一方面在以小土群为主的基础上根据具体情况抓紧小群炉的基本建设。目前全省正在开展的群众性的技术革新运动，将大大加速“小土群”炼钢炼铁的机械化进程。
    据新华社太原10日电　记者范银怀、郭洁报道：山西各地采取集中连片的办法，开始整顿分散的、单一的“小土群”炼铁炼钢基点，建设土洋结合的钢铁基地。这些钢铁基地建成以后，全省将形成一个大、中、小俱全的钢铁基地网。除原有的阳泉、长治、太原成为年产钢五十万吨到一百万吨的大型钢铁基地外，晋城、蒲县等十四个“小土群”地区也将经过炉型改造和增添设备，成为年产钢十万吨左右的中、小型钢铁基地。
    现在各地本着“土中出洋”“土洋结合”的精神，开始改造土炼炉。长治专区普遍对费力多、风温分散的土方炉和土高炉，采取“编炉成组、建炉成群”的办法加以改造，并且固定专人、固定设备，在生产中实行循环流水作业。这样，不仅提高了炉温，而且节省了近一半的劳动力。太原市、晋南和榆次专区，在改造土炉的同时，正在大量增建一点五立方公尺和三立方公尺的小洋高炉，并且大量增建炼钢土平炉和小转炉，代替消耗木材、煤炭过多的炒钢炉，以降低成本、提高质量。在各个钢铁基地的附近，还掀起了“小土群”开煤窑和大办耐火材料厂和修筑土铁路的热潮。全省要恢复、新建两千多座小煤窑，为钢铁基地提供燃料。
    经过整顿的钢铁基地，已经建立起正常的劳动秩序。各个基地都按照不同的生产任务，分别组成了采矿、冶炼、运输等几支固定的劳动大军。在长治、晋南地区的重点钢铁基地，已经开始建立起生产管理制度和技术操作规程。晋城、武乡、高平和壶关等县，还在各个钢铁联合企业内配备了厂长、党委书记和必要的生产、财务管理干部，生产开始走向正常化。（附图片）
