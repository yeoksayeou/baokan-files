	Produce Good Iron, Refine Good Steel

	At present, iron and steel production in our province has entered a new stage. The most significant sign is that the quantity problem of iron has been solved, and improving the quality of pig iron is a new task. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee proposed: In November, while continuing to increase quantity, greatly improve quality and launch a good iron production competition campaign.

	Some people say that improving quality will prevent the completion of the plan. This is unfounded. On the contrary, because of the improvement of quality and the return of production to normal, completing the plan will be more guaranteed. For example, in order to improve quality, it is necessary to increase the furnace temperature, which will not only turn white iron into gray iron, but also reduce and eliminate furnace bottoming, so that output and quality can be improved simultaneously.

	Some people have always doubted that good iron can be produced by indigenous methods. Therefore, when it comes to improving the quality of iron, they become superstitious about "large, foreign, and specialized," and do not believe in "small, indigenous, and mass." We believe that the masses can solve the quantity problem, and they will certainly be able to solve the quality problem. Indigenous methods will definitely produce good iron. For example, the small blast furnaces of the Yancheng Iron and Steel Plant have been producing gray pig iron in every furnace due to the transformation of the furnace type and the improvement of operating technology; the Lushan Wawu "August 1st" Iron and Steel Plant has also improved its technology, eliminated sintered iron, and improved the quality of iron. Of course, while adhering to the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy, we must also actively establish small modern blast furnaces. In this way, the quantity and quality of iron and steel production will be more guaranteed.

	The key to improving the quality of pig iron lies in fully mobilizing the masses to carry out technological reforms. It is necessary to launch a great airing of views, a great debate on "Why produce high-quality iron?", "Can high-quality iron be produced?", and "How to produce high-quality iron?", so that the broad masses of workers understand the great significance of producing high-quality iron for steelmaking production. On the basis of improving the masses' quality viewpoint through detailed accounting, mobilize the masses to offer suggestions and carry out technological innovations. In terms of specific measures, it is necessary to select excellent furnace types to ensure that iron flows from every furnace; change cold air to hot air to increase furnace temperature; and rationally utilize fuel, raw materials, and fluxes to maintain the stability of the composition. In terms of operation, it is necessary to formulate operating procedures for charging, slagging, and opening to make the small blast furnace "eat less, eat more often, and eat fine food"; strengthen laboratory work and cultivate laboratory forces; and pay special attention to improving the technical level of the iron and steel army, promote "five transformations," and strengthen the management of production to ensure that iron and steel production is carried out in an orderly manner.

	The production of pig iron is for refining steel and for casting various machines with iron. Steel production itself is for rolling various steel products for infrastructure construction and machine manufacturing. If the quality of iron is not good and the sulfur and phosphorus content is too high, qualified steel cannot be refined, and unqualified steel ingots cannot be rolled into steel.

	This brings a series of problems. Our economic departments urgently need to equip various machines, and we also need to accelerate the manufacture of various machines in order to save a lot of labor. Our basic construction units and water conservancy projects urgently need steel. Without a large amount of good steel and iron, it will drag down the legs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture and hinder the high-speed progress of various constructions.

	Quantity and quality cannot be separated. High output must be accompanied by high quality. High-output figures without quality content are actually low output. Without the basis of high output, we cannot talk about quality. Now everyone has found a way to achieve high pig iron output, and they should, and it is possible, to pay attention to quality at the same time. In order to produce more good iron, good steel, and good coal, it is necessary to further mobilize the masses. We have been able to rely on the masses to increase output, so that our steel, iron, and coal production has been raised to an unprecedented level and we have passed the output hurdle. Then in the future, we will certainly be able to rely on the masses and mobilize the masses to strive to improve the quality of pig iron. For this reason, we require high-yield "satellites" and also high-quality "satellites." We firmly believe that indigenous iron furnaces can have high output and high quality.

### 出好铁  炼好钢

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    出好铁  炼好钢
    目前，我省钢铁生产已进入一个新的阶段，最显著的标志，就是铁的数量问题已经解决了，提高生铁质量，则是一项新的任务。因此，省委提出：11月份在继续增加数量的基础上，大大提高质量，开展生产好铁竞赛运动。
    有人说，提高质量就完不成计划。这是没有根据的。相反，由于质量的提高，生产走向正常，完成计划会更有保证。比如为了提高质量，要增加炉温，不仅使白铁变成灰铁，而且可以减少和消灭炉子结底现象，产量、质量可以同时跃进。
    有人一直怀疑，土法炼不出好铁。因而一说提高铁的质量，他们又迷信“大、洋、专，”不相信“小、土、群”。我们认为，群众既可以解决数量问题，也一定可以解决质量问题。土办法一定会炼出好铁来。如郾城炼铁厂的小高炉，由于改造了炉型，改进了操作技术，炉炉炼出灰生铁；鲁山瓦屋八一钢铁厂，也是进行了技术改进，消灭了烧结铁，提高了铁的质量。当然，我们在坚持“小土群”方针的同时，还要积极建立小洋高炉。这样，钢铁生产的数量和质量将更有保证。
    提高生铁质量的关键，在于充分发动群众，进行技术改革。要开展“为什么生产优质铁？”“能不能生产优质铁？”“怎样生产优质铁？” 的大鸣大放大辩论，使广大职工认识到生产优质铁对炼钢生产的重大意义，在通过算大账、算细账，提高群众质量观点的基础上，发动群众献策献计，进行技术革新。在具体措施上，要选择优良炉型，保证炉炉流铁水；冷风改热风，增加炉温；合理利用燃料、原料、溶剂等，以保持成分的稳定性；在操作上要制订上料、出碴、开口的操作规程，使小高炉“少吃、多餐、吃细粮”；加强化验工作，培养化验力量；特别要注意提高钢铁大军的技术水平，推行“五化”，加强生产的管理工作，使钢铁生产有秩序的进行。
                                        （河南日报）
    生产生铁是为了炼出钢来，同时用铁铸造各种机器。钢的生产本身又是为了轧制各种钢材，以供基建和机器制造之用。如果铁的质量不好，含硫磷过高，就炼不出合格的钢来，这种不合格的钢锭就轧不成钢材。
    这就带来了一系列的问题，我们各经济部门是急需装备各种机器的，为了大量节省劳动力，也需要加紧制造各种机器；我们各基本建设单位，各项水利工程，都急需钢材使用。没有大量的好钢好铁，就将拖着工农业大跃进的腿，阻碍各项建设高速度前进。
    产量与质量两者是不能分割的，高产量同时就要高质量。没有质量内容的高产数字，实际上是低产。没有高产量的基础就不能谈到质量。现在大家对生铁高产已摸到了门路，就应该、同时也就有可能来注意质量了。为了生产更多的好铁、好钢、好煤，那就必须进一步发动群众，我们能够依靠群众提高了产量，使我们的钢、铁、煤的产量，提到了空前未有的水平，过了产量关。那么今后我们也一定能依靠群众、发动群众努力提高生铁的质量。为此我们要求有高产“卫星”，也要有高质量的“卫星”。我们坚信土铁炉能有高产量也能有高质量。　（新湖南报）
