Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 18th. Chaoyang County in Guangdong Province is implementing political education in its secondary schools by using the countryside as the classroom, the laboring people as teachers, and the realities of political life as teaching materials, with very good results.

During the upsurge of rural people's communes, although Chaoyang County's secondary schools educated students about the people's communes, some ideological problems could not be well resolved in the classroom because teachers and students lacked practical understanding of the rural situation and real political struggles. For example, some students had doubts about whether farmers would suffer losses from "the collectivization of the means of production" and whether they would be willing to accept it. Therefore, from early October to mid-October, Chaoyang County decided to organize teachers and students from various schools to participate in productive labor and central tasks in rural areas, learning, speaking out, and debating while experiencing real life, in order to carry out a deep, lively, and vivid communist education.

Upon arriving in the countryside, a female student from Xiashan Middle School saw farmers enthusiastically signing up for the steelmaking army. Even an old mother encouraged her only son to sign up. She asked the old mother, "Why are you willing for your child to go to make steel?" The old mother replied readily, "Why wouldn't I be willing? Our mother and son's happy life today is all thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party. Whatever the Party says to do, we will do it, and it's sure to be right." After hearing this, the female student said, "I truly admire the farmers from the bottom of my heart." Some students from Shalun Middle School saw that after the tangerine orchards were collectivized into the commune, the farmers still went to the orchards early and worked late every day to prune, remove pests, and fertilize. One student asked a farmer, "Now that the tangerine orchards belong to the commune, why are you working so hard?" The farmer replied, "Even though it belongs to the commune, I still have a share in it!" Through these events, teachers and students from various schools launched discussions, specifically resolving ideological problems. Many students said: When listening to lectures in school, they did not have much feeling. This time, going to the countryside and seeing the broad masses of farmers working selflessly for the sake of socialist construction, they truly had the most vivid, concrete, and profound communist education lesson.

### 拜劳动人民为老师  以现实生活作教材  潮阳中等学校在农村进行政治教育效果很好

    拜劳动人民为老师  以现实生活作教材
    潮阳中等学校在农村进行政治教育效果很好
    新华社广州18日电　广东省潮阳县各中等学校的政治教育，实行以农村为课堂、拜劳动人民为教师、以实现政治生活作教材，效果很好。
    在农村人民公社化的高潮中，潮阳县各中等学校虽然对学生进行了有关人民公社的教育，但是由于学校师生对农村情况和现实的政治斗争缺乏实际了解，有些思想问题在课堂中不能很好解决。例如有的学生对“生产资料归公社，农民会不会吃亏？乐意不乐意？”还有怀疑。因此潮阳县在10月初到10月中旬，决定组织各校师生到农村去参加生产劳动和中心工作，在实际生活中边看、边鸣放、边辩论，进行一次深入的、生动活泼的共产主义教育。
    初到农村，峡山中学一个女学生看到农民踊跃报名参加钢铁大军，连一个老妈妈也鼓励自己的独子报名时，她便问老妈妈：“你为什么愿意孩子去炼铁呀？”这个老妈妈爽朗地回答说：“为什么不愿意？我们母子今天的幸福生活都是共产党领导得来的，党说要做什么，我们就做什么，准没错的。”这位女学生听了后说：“我这回从心底佩服农民了。”沙陇中学有的学生看到柑田归公社后，农民每天还是起早贪黑地到柑田去整枝、除虫和施肥。一个学生去问农民说：“柑田已经归公社了，你为什么这样卖力干呢？”这位农民答道：“归公社也有我的一分啊！”通过这些事情，各校师生展开了鸣放辩论，具体地解决了思想问题。很多学生说：在学校里听课时没有什么感受，这次下乡，看到广大农民为社会主义建设公而忘私、积极劳动的情景，才真正是上了一次最生动、最具体、最深刻的共产主义教育课。
