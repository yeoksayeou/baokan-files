    Canadian Labour Progressive Party Severely Criticizes the Yugoslav Communist Program
    Revisionism is the Vanguard of Imperialist Anti-Communism
    This newspaper reports: The Canadian Labour Progressive Party’s official publication, "Marxist Review" (published in Toronto), published on September 8th a "Statement by the Labour Progressive Party on the Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia," criticizing the revisionist views of the Yugoslav Communist program.
  The statement pointed out that the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the program finally adopted by the Congress, as well as the main reports made by Tito, Kardelj, and Ranković at the Congress, contained a policy that fundamentally revises the long-tested principles of Marxism-Leninism. Moreover, this revisionist policy is now presented as a systematic opinion embodied in a program.
    The statement said that discussion and criticism of this revisionist policy by the international communist movement is not "interference" in the internal affairs of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, but is the duty of communists everywhere, especially since revisionism is an international phenomenon that manifests itself in various countries; it is a collection of opportunist, anti-Marxist views, and promoting revisionism can only benefit imperialism.
    The statement of the Canadian Labour Progressive Party pointed out that, in this context, the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia—who are also the leaders of a country—cannot but become an international center of revisionism by writing revisionist views into the program. This makes it a matter of direct and urgent importance to our party.
    It is no accident that the anti-Marxist-Leninist views contained in the Yugoslav Communist program and the anti-Soviet remarks made by the Yugoslav Communist leaders at the recent Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia echo the views put forward by Canadian revisionists. For example: elevating national forms or characteristics above the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, promoting the erroneous theory of "national communism" in opposition to proletarian internationalism—which means surrendering to and fueling bourgeois nationalism;
    Opposing the basic principle of Marxism-Leninism—the dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, the necessity for the working class to hold state power;
    Denying the leading and organizing role of a communist party based on democratic centralism and ideologically unified on the basis of Marxist-Leninist theory;
    Revisionists insist that imperialism and state monopoly capitalism will automatically "grow into" socialism, thus denying the class struggle to seize power; slandering the historically endowed leading role of the Soviet Union in the socialist state system and the Soviet Communist Party's enormous theoretical and practical contributions to the international communist movement.
    This revisionist stance has led to the emergence in the Yugoslav Communist program and speeches at the Yugoslav Communist Congress of such "theories" that the phenomenon of the world being divided into two major systems, imperialism and socialism, does not exist, that the imperialist war camp headed by the United States and the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union are both equally "great power blocs," and that socialist countries and communists should not participate in either side and should be "beyond" both. Tito went even further, saying that American imperialism gave Yugoslavia "selfless" aid, while Soviet aid was "exploitation," and that the Soviet Union's peaceful policy was the "cause" of imperialist war preparations and the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization war alliance!
    This is contrary to and an attack on the declaration of peace by the communist and workers' parties of sixty-four countries, which the League of Communists of Yugoslavia also signed.
  The statement said that the Canadian Labour Progressive Party supports the programmatic declarations of the communist and workers' parties of the twelve socialist countries and the peace declaration of the parties of sixty-four countries, believing that these two declarations embody the ideological and political unity of the world communist movement. This unity is absolutely necessary in order to defeat world imperialism and to strengthen and expand the world system of socialist countries.
    "Therefore, we unequivocally declare that the program and policies of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia are anti-Marxist-Leninist, revisionist, and that they are a disruption and attack on the ideological unity of the world communist movement and the international struggle for peace, and that they are beneficial to imperialism."
    The statement mentioned that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia stubbornly refused to conduct fraternal discussions on its draft program and to study the experiences of other parties, especially the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which has further distanced them from the path of working-class internationalism and isolated them from the world communist movement.
    The statement concluded by saying that today, the vanguard of the ideological struggle of the imperialists against communism and the cause of peace and socialism is revisionism; it takes many forms, forms alliances with various counter-revolutionary groups, establishes international ties, and uses the new program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the speeches of the revisionist leaders of Yugoslavia to confuse Canadian workers and incite anti-Marxist and anti-Soviet sentiments. Therefore, revisionism is the main danger facing our party and the cause of socialism, and it must be exposed and resolutely fought to the end.

### 加劳工进步党严厉批判南共纲领  修正主义是帝国主义反共急先锋

    加劳工进步党严厉批判南共纲领
    修正主义是帝国主义反共急先锋
    本报讯　加拿大劳工进步党机关刊物“马克思主义评论”（多伦多出版）9月8日刊载了“劳工进步党关于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领的声明”，批判南共纲领的修正主义观点。
  声明指出，南共纲领草案和南共代表大会最后通过的纲领，以及铁托、卡德尔和兰科维奇在代表大会上所作的主要报告，包含着一种政策，这种政策要在根本问题上修正久经考验的马克思列宁主义原则。不仅如此，这种修正主义政策现在是作为体现在一个纲领中的系统化意见提出来的。
    声明说，国际共产主义运动讨论和批评这种修正主义政策，不仅不是“干涉”南共内部事务，而且是任何地方共产党人的本分，特别是由于修正主义是一种国际现象，在各国都有表现；它集机会主义的反马克思主义的观点之大成，宣扬修正主义，这只能够对帝国主义有利。
    加拿大劳工进步党的声明指出，在这种情况下，南共领导人——他们也是一个国家的领导人——把修正主义观点写进纲领中就不能不成为修正主义的国际中心。这使它成了对我们的党有直接和迫切重要意义的问题。
    南共纲领和南共领导人在南共最近举行的代表大会上的反苏言论中所包含的反马克思列宁主义的观点同加拿大修正主义者提出的观点一鼻孔出气，这不是偶然的事。例如：把民族形式或特点提高到马克思列宁主义基本原则之上，宣扬错误的“民族共产主义”的理论，同无产阶级国际主义相对立——这意味着向资产阶级民族主义投降和助长资产阶级民族主义；
    反对马克思列宁主义的基本原则——无产阶级专政，即工人阶级掌握国家政权的必要性；
    否认一个以民主集中制为基础的和在马克思列宁主义理论的基础上思想一致的共产党的领导作用和组织作用；
    修正主义者硬说帝国主义和国家垄断资本主义会自动“长入”社会主义，因此否认夺取政权的阶级斗争；诬蔑苏联在社会主义国家体系中的历史所赋予的领导地位和苏联共产党对国际共产主义运动的理论和实践的巨大贡献。
    这种修正主义的立场使南共纲领和南共代表大会上的发言中出现了这样的“理论”：世界分裂为帝国主义和社会主义两大体系的现象是不存在的，以美国为首的帝国主义战争阵营和以苏联为首的和平阵营同样都是“大国集团”，社会主义国家和共产党人应该不参加双方，并且“超乎”双方。铁托更进一步说，美帝国主义给予南斯拉夫“无私的”援助，而苏联的援助却是“剥削”，苏联的和平政策是帝国主义备战和成立北大西洋公约组织战争同盟的“原因”！
    这是同南共也在上面签字的六十四国共产党和工人党和平宣言相违背的，并且是对这个宣言的攻击。
  声明说，加拿大劳工进步党拥护十二个社会主义国家共产党和工人党的纲领性宣言和六十四国的党的和平宣言，认为这两个宣言体现了世界共产主义运动的思想和政治团结。为了击败世界帝国主义，为了加强和扩大社会主义国家世界体系，这种团结是完全必要的。
    “因此，我们毫不含糊地宣称，南共的纲领和政策是反马克思列宁主义的，是修正主义的，它们是对世界共产主义运动的思想团结和国际争取和平的斗争的破坏和攻击，它们是对帝国主义有利的。”
    声明谈到，南共领导人顽固地拒绝就它的纲领草案进行兄弟的讨论和学习其他党、特别是苏共的经验，这已经使他们更加脱离工人阶级国际主义的道路，更加自绝于世界共产主义运动。
    声明最后说，今天，帝国主义者对共产主义与和平和社会主义事业的思想斗争的急先锋是修正主义；它采取许多形式，同各种反革命集团结成联盟，建立国际联系，利用南共新纲领和南斯拉夫修正主义领导人的言论来迷惑加拿大工人，鼓动反马克思主义和反苏的情绪。因此，修正主义是我们党和社会主义事业所面临的主要危险，必须加以揭露和同它坚决地斗争到底。
