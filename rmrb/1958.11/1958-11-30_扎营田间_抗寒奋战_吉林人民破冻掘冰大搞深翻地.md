Camping in the Fields, Fighting the Cold

Jilin People Break Frozen Ground and Dig Ice to Vigorously Carry Out Deep Plowing

(Our report) After completing the general deep plowing task by the end of October, Jilin Province has now entered a second deep plowing high tide of large-scale basic farmland and satellite fields. As of the 16th, the province's deep-plowed area reached 50,092,500 mu, accounting for 113.1% of the 1959 planting plan. Among them, 13,638,000 mu were plowed one chi (foot) or more, accounting for 89.1% of the basic farmland plan, and 1,042,080 mu were plowed three chi or more, accounting for 38.6% of the satellite field plan. Currently, Yongji, Yushu, and Nong'an counties have completed their entire deep plowing tasks ahead of schedule and exceeded their quotas. Yongji County's satellite fields with a depth of more than three chi exceeded the province's requirement of one-third of a mu of satellite field per person by more than 38%. The experimental fields of many county and commune cadres are generally deep-plowed to a depth of five chi to one zhang (ten chi).

The high tide of deep plowing in Jilin Province gradually formed from the beginning of October. Because the Party committees at all levels paid attention to implementing the struggle between the two roads from the beginning, and thoroughly criticized the "habit theory," "condition-only theory," and "special theory," the deep plowing work leaped forward again and again. By the end of October, within one month, the deep plowing plan for general fields was overfulfilled by 6.4%.

Currently, the ground is frozen nearly one chi deep, and the cold wind is biting. However, the people of Jilin, determined to get grain from the land, are breaking frozen ground and digging ice with the heroic spirit of masters of nature, taking advantage of their victory to launch a fierce attack, and advancing to deeper soil layers. Some use dynamite to blast open the frozen soil layer and continue deep plowing; some make tools for deep plowing frozen layers; some have created methods for deep plowing frozen ground, camping in the fields, and fighting the cold. Now, in many places, thick smoke billows during the day, and lights shine brightly at night. The sound of explosions against the frozen ground rises and falls one after another. Shuangliao County on the western prairie, after completing the deep plowing task for general fields at the end of October, immediately organized a field army of 40,000 people, led by the first secretary of the county party committee, to station on both sides of the Liao River, determined to deep plow 300,000 mu of cultivated land to a depth of more than three chi. They also put forward the requirements of "plowing, harrowing, and compacting simultaneously, achieving level ground like a mirror, straight ridges like lines, and applying fertilizer in layers, making satellite fields into gardens," and challenged the neighboring Lishu County to a competition. In Da'an County, land deep-plowed more than one chi has reached 219% of the basic farmland plan. They recently put forward the fighting goal of "3,000 jin per mu in the entire county, and letting all cultivated land release satellites," and continue to increase deep-plowed land, determined to plow all the cultivated land in the county to a depth of more than one chi in the shortest possible time. This county has also generally achieved fertilization while plowing, and the fertilized area has reached more than 77% of the cultivated area. Fuyu County, on the Songhua River, in order to improve the speed of deep plowing, from the county to the township communes and work areas, leaders at all levels personally took command and established regiments, battalions, and companies at each level, clarified tasks, and launched a deep plowing blitz. The county's newly built nineteen saltpeter boiling factories and nine gunpowder factories produce more than 900 jin of locally made explosives (without sulfur) per day, which are promptly supplied to the needs of deep plowing fields. Currently, on the land of the entire county, explosions resound, and songs shake the sky and the earth. More than 20,000 soldiers in the entire county, under the slogan of "Deep plow even if the ground is frozen three chi deep, and do not withdraw until the task is completed," are increasing the progress of deep plowing day by day. After the ground froze in Nong'an County, the morale was even stronger. Under the slogan of "Everything give way to deep plowing," the number of people deep plowing the land increased from more than 70,000 before the 10th to more than 90,000 after the 10th, and the progress of plowing increased by 50% compared to the original.

    扎营田间　抗寒奋战
    吉林人民破冻掘冰大搞深翻地
    本报讯　吉林省在10月底完成了一般深翻地任务之后，现已进入大搞基本田、卫星田的第二次深翻高潮。截至16日止，全省深翻地面积达五千零九十二万五千亩，为1959年播种计划的113.1％。其中，一尺以上的一千三百六十三万八千亩，占基本田计划的89.1％，三尺以上的一百零四万二千零八十亩，占卫星田计划的38.6％。目前已有永吉、榆树、农安等三县提前超额完成了全部深翻任务。永吉县深翻三尺以上的卫星田比省里规定的每人三分卫星田的指标提高了38％以上。许多县、社干部的试验田一般都深翻五尺到一丈。
    吉林省深翻地高潮，从10月初逐步形成。由于各级党委一开始就注意贯彻两条道路的斗争。彻底批判了“习惯论”“唯条件论”和“特殊论”以后，使深翻工作一跃再跃，到10月底，一个月内，就超额6.4％完成了一般田的深翻计划。
    目前，地冻近尺，寒风袭人。但决心向大地要粮的吉林人民，正以大自然主人的英雄气概，破冻掘冰，乘胜猛攻，向更深的土层进军。有的用土炸药把冻土层炸开，继续深翻；有的制作破冻层深耕工具；有的创造了破冻深翻方法，扎营田间，抗寒奋战。现在，不少地方，白天浓烟滚滚，夜晚灯火齐明。向冻地开战的爆破声，此起彼伏。西部草原上的双辽县，在10月末完成了一般田的深翻任务后，立即组织了四万人参加的野战兵团，由县委第一书记带领驻扎辽河两岸，决心把三十万亩耕地深翻三尺以上。他们还提出“随翻随耙随镇压，达到地平如镜，埂直如线，分层施肥，使卫星田园田化”的要求，与邻近的梨树县挑战竞赛。大安县深翻一尺以上的土地已达基本田计划的219％，他们最近又提出了“全县亩产三千斤，让所有耕地都放卫星”的奋斗目标，继续增加深翻地，决心在最短期间，把全县所有的耕地都翻到一尺以上。这个县还普遍做到了随翻随施肥，施肥面积已达耕地面积77％以上。松花江畔的扶余县，为提高深翻的速度，从县到乡社、作业区，由各级领导亲自挂帅，逐级成立了团、营、连，明确任务，突击深翻。这个县新建的十九座熬硝厂、九座火药厂，日产土炸药（不用硫磺）九百余斤，及时供应了深翻田的需要。目前，全县的土地上，爆破声??，歌声震天地。全县二万多名战士，在“地冻三尺要深耕，不完成任务不收兵”的口号下，深翻进度与日俱增。农安县结冻后，士气更加旺盛。他们在“一切给深翻让路”的口号下，深翻地的人数由10日前七万多人，增加到10日后的九万多人，翻地进度比原来提高50％。　（蔡明）（附图片）
