Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, delivered a report to the Second National Congress of Youth Socialist Construction Activists this afternoon. The title of the report was: "Promote the Communist Spirit and Strive to Build Socialism."

In his report, Hu Yaobang first extended a warm welcome on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League to the five thousand youth activists attending the congress. He said to the youth activists: "You are representatives of the broad masses of youth who have made outstanding contributions on various fronts of our country's socialist construction, and you embody the direction of advancement of this generation of youth in our country."

Hu Yaobang said: "Our current congress is being held under the close concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We must not only make this congress a meeting to review the achievements and contributions of the national youth in socialist construction, but also make it a mobilization rally for the youth of our country to respond to the call of the Party, further mobilize, promote the Communist spirit under the illumination of the Party's General Line, and strive to build socialism."

In his report, Hu Yaobang narrated the great achievements created by the people of our country under the illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction during the Great Leap Forward, and the active role of youth on various fronts in socialist construction. He encouraged the youth activists, saying: "The youth of our country have already made enormous contributions to the cause of socialist construction. But we have no reason to be proud and complacent. We young people, after all, are young, not politically and ideologically mature enough, and have not been tempered by thousands of trials in practical struggle. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao expect us youth to become successors who can withstand storms, to take over the revolutionary cause of the working class from our fathers and brothers like a relay race."

Hu Yaobang put forward the future direction of efforts for the youth on various fronts. He especially put forward four things that the broad masses of youth must do in order to better serve the socialist cause of the motherland. These are: First, actively participate in labor, everyone without exception must develop the habit of labor, and diligently study and improve their skills in labor; Second, work harder to learn culture and science, work harder to learn Marxist-Leninist theory, and closely combine these two kinds of learning to advance towards the goal of "both red and expert," and "thoroughly red and deeply expert"; Third, promote initiative and creativity, thoroughly break down superstitions, liberate thoughts, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and closely combine the daring and capable spirit of young people with a realistic and pragmatic style; Fourth, we must raise the red flag of communism high in our minds, constantly improve our communist ideological consciousness, and constantly improve our communist moral qualities.

In the last part of his report, Hu Yaobang said in an excited tone: "The demise of imperialism is already certain. The victory of socialism is also already certain. Our great motherland is moving from victory to victory irresistibly." "1959 is the second year of our people's three years of hard work, the decisive year in which our people are determined to fundamentally change the face of the country, and the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland. As such a year is approaching, we will naturally think that the revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary elders have already opened up an infinitely bright road for us. We should be as promising and accomplished as our revolutionary elders. The Party calls on our youth to fight for even greater victories in 1959, together with the people of the whole country. I believe that the comrades present can fully represent the youth of the whole country in accepting this call loudly!"

Hu Yaobang's report started at 3:00 pm and ended at 5:00 pm. Throughout the report, the entire body of youth activists repeatedly expressed their heartfelt support and great welcome for the report with warm applause.

    发扬共产主义精神  努力建设社会主义
    胡耀邦向青年积极分子大会作报告
    新华社25日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会书记处第一书记胡耀邦，今天下午向第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会作了报告。报告的题目是：“发扬共产主义精神，努力建设社会主义”。
    胡耀邦在报告中首先代表共青团中央向到会的五千名青年积极分子表示热烈的欢迎。他向青年积极分子们说：“你们是在我国社会主义建设的各个战线上做了出色贡献的广大青年的代表，在你们身上，反映着我国这一代青年的前进方向。”
    胡耀邦说：“我们这次大会是在党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀下召开的。我们不但要使这次大会成为检阅全国青年在社会主义建设中的成就和贡献的一次会师大会，而且要使它成为我国青年响应党的号召，进一步动员起来，在党的总路线的照耀下，发扬共产主义精神，努力建设社会主义的誓师大会。”
    胡耀邦在报告中叙述了我国人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，在全民大跃进中创造出的伟大成就，以及各个战线上的青年在社会主义建设中的积极作用。他勉励青年积极分子们说：“我国青年在社会主义建设事业上已经作出巨大的贡献。但是我们没有理由骄傲和自满。我们青年究竟因为年轻，政治上和思想上还不够成熟，还没有在实际斗争中经过千锤百炼的锻炼。党中央和毛主席期待我们青年成为经得起暴风雨的接班人，从我们的父兄手上像接力赛跑一样地把工人阶级革命事业接替下去。”
    胡耀邦向各个战线上的青年提出了今后的努力方向。他特别向广大青年提出为了更好地为祖国的社会主义事业服务而必须做到的四件事。这就是：第一、积极地参加劳动，人人无例外地要养成劳动的习惯，并且在劳动中刻苦钻研，提高自己的本领；第二、更加努力地学习文化和科学，更加努力地学习马克思列宁主义理论，并且把这两种学习密切地结合起来，向“又红又专”、“红透专深”的目标前进；第三、发扬积极性和创造性，彻底破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢说敢做，并且使青年人中的那种敢想敢干的精神同实事求是的作风密切结合起来；第四、一定要在思想上高高地树起共产主义的红旗，不断地提高自己的共产主义思想觉悟，不断地提高自己的共产主义道德品质。
    胡耀邦在报告的最后部分以兴奋的语调说道：“帝国主义的灭亡，已经是肯定的了。社会主义的胜利，也已经是肯定的了。我们伟大的祖国，正在不可阻挡地从胜利走向胜利。”“1959年是我国人民苦战三年的第二年，是我国人民决心基本改变国家面貌的带决战性的一年，是我们伟大祖国建国的十周年。在这样一个年头即将来临的时候，我们自然会想到，革命先烈，革命长辈，已经为我们开辟了一条无限光明的大道。我们应该像我们的革命长辈那样，大有出息，大有作为。党号召我们青年，在1959年，同全国人民一道，为争取更大的胜利而斗争。我相信，在座的同志完全可以代表全国青年响亮地接受这个号召！”
    胡耀邦的报告从下午三时开始，到五时结束。在整个报告进行期间，全体青年积极分子一次又一次地以热烈的掌声表示对这个报告的衷心的拥护和极大的欢迎。
