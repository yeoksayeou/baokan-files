	A Peasant Inventor
	裴化
	Because the children were being noisy, and also because he had worries on his mind, Zhang Guangyi didn't close his eyes all night. He made up his mind: he had to call her back! Anxiously waiting for daybreak, he jumped up, hurriedly wiped his face, and ran out without bothering to start a fire and cook. Just as he stepped out the door, he heard the children crying again inside, so he had to return and patiently coax them before he could leave.

	He first went to the production team leader's house to ask for leave, and then dashed off to his father-in-law's house outside the village. Ah, so early, his wife was already out fetching water. He went up and greeted her with a "Hey," but unexpectedly, as soon as she saw him, she quickly shrank back inside the door with the buckets, and slammed the bolt shut with a "喀哒" sound. Zhang Guangyi knocked for a while without being able to open it, and said, "What's wrong with you? Aren't you afraid people will laugh at you?" From inside the door came a "Humph," and she said, "It's precisely because I'm afraid people will laugh that I'm getting a divorce from you." "If you want a divorce, then divorce, why did you sneak back to your mother's house?" "Isn't it because we couldn't get divorced? Didn't you hear the Party Branch Secretary trying to persuade us?" "Then come back, you can't stay at your mother's house forever." "......" There was no answer from inside the door. After waiting for a while, seeing no movement, Zhang Guangyi had to plead softly, "I say, you should come back, I specially invited you, and the children are waiting for you too?" "Then you promise not to be foolishly inventive anymore?" "What foolishly inventive! Aren't you enlightened yet? Creation and invention are serious matters, and I've figured it out." "Heh, I'm not enlightened, I'm backward, you're progressive, then let's go our separate ways." "Are you coming back or not?" "Not coming back." "You have to come back even if you don't want to, you come out for me!" "Not coming out, what can you do?"......

	The two of them argued back and forth through the door. Zhang Guangyi got anxious and knocked on the door like a drum, but the door just wouldn't open. "If you don't open it, I'll smash it with a rock!" This worked, and with a "Ya" sound, the door did open. But standing in the doorway was his father-in-law, scowling and puffing on his dry tobacco pipe. Zhang Guangyi felt a chill, thinking that the old man was even more stubborn than his daughter, what could he say to get through to him? Just as he was pondering, the old man opened his mouth and said coldly, "Good son-in-law, coming to pay respects to your in-laws early in the morning?" Seeing that his son-in-law didn't speak, he said again, "To tell you the truth, because of your foolish inventions, the commune has already lost four or five hundred yuan. Now the cadres are criticizing you, the masses are scolding you, and my daughter is too embarrassed to live with you. Consider me unlucky, having to support my daughter after she's been married off..." Zhang Guangyi was so angry he couldn't stand it, and ran off before the old man finished speaking.

	Zhang Guangyi ran halfway, calmed down, and said to himself, "This won't do, I have to produce, cook, and take care of the children, I haven't slept for two nights, where do I have time to engage in creation and invention?" After thinking for a while, he got an idea: "Either you come back, or you take the children with you, anyway, I won't let you hold me back." Returning home, he picked up the youngest, led the second oldest, and had the oldest follow behind, and went to his father-in-law's house again.

	The four of them knocked on the door for a long time, but there was no response. It turned out that the old man had seen it was him through the crack in the door and was deliberately ignoring him. Zhang Guangyi had an idea, arranged for the children to sit at the door, and said loudly, "I'm leaving, the children are all here, it's up to you whether you take care of them or not!" But he didn't go far, hiding behind a big tree. The children, not seeing their father, cried and shouted, finally drawing their mother out. She picked up the children, looked around, and said fiercely, "Heartless man...". While wiping away the children's tears, she was also crying herself. Zhang Guangyi, seeing the mother and children crying together, couldn't help but feel sad. He wanted to go forward, but stopped, stood there for a while, and quietly left.

	As he reached the village entrance, he encountered two backward masses. One said, "The engineer is here, make way, make way." Another said, "The expert, leisurely strolling, so carefree, not much different from a loafer." Zhang Guangyi pretended not to hear, and went home with his head down.

	Before he knew it, it was getting dark. Zhang Guangyi was hungry and tired, and collapsed on the bed as soon as he entered the house. But he couldn't sleep, his mind was in a mess. He thought: I can ignore other people's gossip, but the obstruction from my family is really difficult to bear. I, Zhang Guangyi, am engaged in creation and invention, reforming tools, for the sake of the whole village's water conservation, for the sake of building socialism, I have no ulterior motives, why is everyone against it? ... No, everyone is not against it, it's just one or two cadres with conservative ideas, and two or three backward masses who are against it. Didn't the Party Branch Secretary strongly support me? Besides, it was also my own first shot that didn't hit the mark, the reformed tool failed, and the commune wasted forty or fifty yuan, so the old-minded people are naturally unwilling. I remember when I didn't even have food to eat, but now life is better, and I've become a Communist Party member, how can I lose heart now? Thinking of this, Zhang Guangyi suddenly rolled off the bed, lit the lamp, took it to the front of Chairman Mao's portrait, looked at Chairman Mao, and said silently, "You old man can hear me, I swear I will never leave the Party. I would rather not have a wife, I will resolutely carry on."

	At this time, the Party Branch Secretary pushed the door open and came in: "Old Zhang, how is it going? I was busy with meetings today and didn't have time to come here. Eh, where did the children go?" Zhang Guangyi felt like he had seen a relative, and grabbed the Secretary tightly. After a long time, he explained the whole story. The Secretary patted Zhang Guangyi's shoulder sympathetically, kindly pulled him to the bed to sit down, and waited for his excitement to calm down before saying seriously to him: "New things often need a period of time to be accepted, don't be discouraged, the Party fully supports your creation. ... Your wife, it doesn't matter, she will change her mind, I will talk to her again tomorrow. Tonight, I've invited some experts, they will be here soon. Come on, let's discuss it first!"

	The window paper was almost turning white, and the light in Zhang Guangyi's room was still shining brightly. The Party Branch Secretary, carpenter Old Zheng, and several commune members, plus himself, were gathered around the table, pointing at a design drawing and talking about something. ....................

	This happened two years ago in Wencun Township, Dengfeng County, Henan Province. Since then, with the support of the Party and the masses, Zhang Guangyi has created fifteen new tools. He has truly become an expert and engineer. He has been hired as a special researcher at the Institute of Agricultural Machinery, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. He also formed a technical research group with surrounding carpenters, old farmers, and the village's "know-it-alls," and later established the "Academy of Science and Technology," successively creating four new tools and improving seventeen old tools with everyone. He is truly a daring, resolute, and indomitable communist fighter!

	As for his wife, readers can rest assured, she soon became enlightened under the Party's education and has long since reconciled with Zhang Guangyi. The old father-in-law, the cadres with conservative ideas, and the backward masses have all changed for the better after the waves of the Great Leap Forward.

    一个农民发明家
    裴化
    因为孩子闹，也因为自己有心事，张广义又一夜没閤眼，他下定决心：非把她叫回来不可！眼巴巴等到天亮，他一骨碌爬起，胡乱擦把脸，顾不上起火做饭，就往外跑。刚跨出门，听见屋里孩子又哭了，只得返回来，百般耐心地哄住了，才抽开身去。
    他先到生产队长家告了个假，就朝村外岳父家飞奔。啊，好早，孩子他妈已经出来担水了。他上前去才招呼了一声“喂”，不料她一见他，赶紧连人带桶一块缩回门里，喀?一声下了栓。张广义敲了一阵敲不开，发话道：“你这是怎么的了？也不怕人家笑话。”门里“哼”了一声道：“就是怕人家笑话，才跟你离婚。”“离就离呗，干嘛又悄悄儿的走娘家来了？”“不是离不成吗？没听见党支书劝说来着？”“那就回呗，总不能一辈子老在娘家。”“……”，门里没答话。等了一阵，不见动静，张广义只得软软地央求道：“我说，你还是回吧，我特意请你来了，孩子们也等着你呢？”“那你是答应不再胡生法了？”“什么胡生法！你还不开窍？创造发明是正经事，我是搞定了。”“嘿，我不开窍，我落后，你进步，那就各走各道吧。”“你倒是回不回？”“不回。”“不回也得回，你给我出来！”“不出来，你敢咋的？”……
    两个隔着门儿你一句我一句，就此顶上了嘴。张广义急了，把门敲得锣鼓般响，可是门就是不开。“你再不开，看我拿石头砸！”这话真灵，呀的一声门果真开了。不过当门站的却是老岳父，正虎着脸，把旱烟抽得丝丝响。张广义一见，凉了半截，心想老头子比他闺女还顽固，用什么话去说通他？正思忖间，老头子开口了，冷冷地：“好女婿，大清老早就上岳家请安来了？”见女婿不言语，就又说：“实告你罢，就为着你那胡生法，社里都赔了四、五百元了，如今干部斗你，群众骂你，我闺女也没脸跟你过了。算我晦气，嫁了闺女还得老子来养活，……”张广义气得不行，没待老头子说完就跑了。
    张广义跑到半路，冷静了下来，心里对自己说：“这样不行，我又得生产，又得做饭照管孩子，两宿没睡觉了，哪还有时间去搞创造发明？”盘算了一阵，得了个主意：“要末你回来，要末你把孩子一块带去，反正不叫你拖住我后腿。”回到家里，抱起老三，牵着老二，叫老大跟在后边，重又上岳父家去。
    父子四个敲了半天门，总不见应声。原来老头子从门缝里瞧见了又是他，故意不答理。张广义心生一计，把孩子们安排着坐在门口，自己高声说道：“我走了，孩子们都来了，管不管由你！”却不走远，闪在一棵大树后面。孩子们不见了大人，又嚷又哭，终于把孩子他妈引了出来。她抱起孩子，四处张望了一下，发狠道：“没良心的，……”。一面替孩子拭泪，一面自己也眼泪直淌。张广义见母子们哭做一团，禁不住也心酸起来，想上前去，又停住了，呆了一会，悄悄走了。
    走到村头，迎面遇上两个落后群众。一个说：“工程师来了，让道让道。”一个说：“专家嘛，悠悠荡荡，好自在，跟二流子差不离。”张广义只做没听见，低着头回了家。
    一来二往，天已擦黑。张广义又饿又累，进门就横倒炕上了。不过怎么也睡不着，心乱如麻。他想：别人闲言闲语都可不管，家里人阻碍实在难当。俺张广义搞创造发明、改革工具，是为了全村水利化，是为了建设社会主义，没啥歪心眼，为啥大家反对？……不对，大家并没反对，反对的不过是一、二个保守思想的干部，二、三个落后群众。党支书不是就极力支持吗？况且也是俺自己头一炮没打响，改革工具失败了，白费了社里四、五十元钱，老脑筋人当然不愿意了。想俺从前苦得没饭吃，如今生活好了，而且成了个共产党员，哪能就此泄了气？想到这里，张广义猛地一翻身下炕，掌上灯，端到毛主席像前，看着毛主席，默默地说：“您老人家可听见俺说话，俺发誓永远不离开党。俺宁可不要老婆，俺也要坚决干下去。”
    这时，党支书推门进来了：“老张，怎么样了？我今天忙着开会，没顾得上这儿来。咦，孩子们都到哪去了？”张广义好像见了亲人一样，猛的一把拉住支书，半晌，才一五一十地说出经过。支书同情地拍了拍张广义的肩膀，亲切地拉他到炕上坐定，直待他这阵激动平静下来，才严肃地对他说：“新事物往往要经过一段时期才能被人接受，不要气馁，党全力支持你的创造。……你爱人，没关系，会回心转意的，我明天就找她再谈谈。今晚，我约了几个内行来，一会儿就到。来，咱们先合计合计吧！”
    窗纸快发白了，张广义屋里的灯还亮亮地。党支书、木匠老郑、还有几个社员，加上他自己，几个头凑在桌前，正对着一张设计图比划着说着什么。……………………
    这是两年前的事了，发生在河南登封县文村乡。从那时起，张广义在党和群众的支持下，创造出了十五种新工具。他真的成了专家、工程师了。他被聘为中国农业科学研究院农业机械研究所的特约研究员。他又联合周围的木匠、老农、村里的“百事通”组成了技术研究小组，后来成立了“科学技术研究院”，陆续地又和大家共同创造出了四种新工具，改良了十七种旧工具。他真是个敢想敢做、百折不挠的共产主义战士！
    至于他老婆，请读者们放心，她在党的教育下不久就觉悟了过来，早已和张广义和好。那老岳父、有保守思想的干部、落后群众，一经过大跃进的风浪，也都转变好了。（附图片）
