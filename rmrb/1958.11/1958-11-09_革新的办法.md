      Innovative Methods
    The "Sprout" editorial department moved to the people's commune to edit, solicit manuscripts, and tutor amateur writing; the People's Daily organized a special page in Wanxian Special District, Sichuan Province - "Thousands of Troops Make Pig Iron" - to praise the heroic spirit and miracles of the steel army. These have been generally welcomed. It is hoped that the editorial departments of all newspapers and periodicals will do the same, and adopt innovative methods for editing work. In this way, not only will the layout be lively and colorful, but the content will also be richer. More importantly, it can closely connect with the broad masses, promote various central tasks, cultivate worker-peasant authors, and truly exert the role of the Party's propaganda tool.

      革新的办法
    “萌芽”编辑部搬到人民公社里进行编辑、组稿、辅导业余创作；人民日报为了歌颂钢铁大军的英雄气概和奇迹，在四川省万县专区组织了一个专页——“千军万马搞生铁”，这些都普遍受到欢迎。希望各报刊的编辑部都这样作，都采取革新的办法进行编辑工作。如此，不仅能使版面式样活泼多采，内容也将更加丰富。更重要的是，能密切联系广大群众，推动各项中心任务，培养工农作者，真正发挥党的宣传工具的作用。
