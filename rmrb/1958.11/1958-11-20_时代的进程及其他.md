    The March of the Times
    The March of the Times
    At this time last year, the declaration issued by the Communist and Workers' Parties of twelve countries at the Moscow Conference stated: "In our era, the development of the world depends on the progress and outcome of the competition between the two opposing social systems." A year has passed, how is the progress? The result of the test: the wheel of history has accelerated greatly compared to the past.
    When the declaration was issued, people cheered that a new stage of the international communist movement had begun. Indeed, since then, the socialist camp has started a rapid Great Leap Forward; a Great Leap Forward in economy; a Great Leap Forward in culture and science; a Great Leap Forward in political life; a Great Leap Forward in spiritual thought; further consolidation and strengthening of the communist ranks; socialist builders showing their abilities, all presenting unprecedented speed and height.
    Why has the wheel of history accelerated so much? The declaration provides us with the answer: "Socialist ideas are mastering the consciousness of more and more millions of people." This is a truth, the more deeply socialist-communist ideas penetrate people's consciousness, the more the forward movement of history will accelerate.

    "+" Sign and "-" Sign
    People often use numbers to illustrate problems. Numbers like the following can indeed clearly illustrate the problem. Comparing the first half of this year with the first half of last year: socialist countries increased pig iron production by 9%, steel by 10%, coal by 11%, and oil by 15%; capitalist countries reduced pig iron production by 19.6%, steel by 19.5%, coal by 9.1%, and oil by 1.8%. One increase and one decrease are so conspicuous. If we want to choose the most concise symbol to most appropriately represent these two camps, I think we can only use "+" and "-". The "+" sign has become the emblem of the socialist camp, and the "-" sign has become the symbol of the capitalist camp. The situation of socialism is called a leap forward, then, can't the situation of the capitalist camp be called a leap backward?
    However, numbers are not everything. If you look at the atmosphere in the spiritual realm: the socialist camp's morale is high, full of joy and singing, while the Western world's morale is decadent, full of troubles and sorrows. The attraction of the socialist system to people's hearts worldwide, and the aversion to the capitalist system in people's hearts, cannot be expressed by numbers.

    Old Ox Cart and "Golden Dragon"
    In the competition between the two major camps, what has been most noticeable in the past year is that two major socialist countries are rapidly catching up with two major capitalist countries in terms of the output of certain products (they have already surpassed in other aspects). Ever since the Soviet Union chose the United States and China chose the United Kingdom as their opponents to catch up with, this matter has been attracting the world's attention. Initially, it was planned to take about fifteen years for the Soviet Union to catch up with or surpass the United States in industrial products per capita. China would catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products. However, after only half a year, we in China declared that we would change a little longer time to a shorter time. And in the Soviet Union, coal production already exceeded the United States last year. Although the competition cannot be finally revealed, the settlement in the first half of the year has already shown a trend. Comparing industrial production with the same period last year, the Soviet Union increased by 10.5%, the United States decreased by 10.8%; China increased by 34%, the United Kingdom decreased by 2.1%. For our two major countries, the second half of the year is even more of a leap forward than the first half; but for the United States and the United Kingdom, it is even worse. Within a year, the two old capitalist countries have already been chased breathless.
    Western newspapers say that we are like a golden dragon, closely chasing after John Bull. We and the Soviet Union deserve to be called golden dragons, but what should the United Kingdom and the United States be compared to? John Bull? Decades ago, it looked a bit like it, but now it seems they walk even slower than an ox. It is very appropriate to describe them with the idiom "an old ox pulling a broken cart."

    时代的进程及其他
    时代的进程
    去年的这个时候，十二个国家的共产党和工人党，在莫斯科会议发表的宣言里说：“在我们的时代里，世界的发展取决于两个对立的社会制度竞赛的进程和结果。”一年过去了，进程怎么样？检验的结果：历史前进的车轮，较以前大大地加速了。
    宣言发表的时候，人们就曾欢呼说从此开始了国际共产主义运动的新阶段。果然，自那以后，社会主义阵营开始了神速的大跃进；经济的大跃进；文化科学的大跃进；政治生活的大跃进；精神思想的大跃进；共产主义者队伍的巩固与团结的进一步加强；社会主义建设者们大显神通，在在都呈现出前所未有的速度和高度。
    历史的车轮为什么会这样加快？宣言向我们提供了答案：“社会主义思想正在掌握着越来越多的成千成万的人们的意识。”这是一个真理，社会主义——共产主义思想越能深入人们的意识，历史的前进运动愈会加速。

    “＋”号和“－”号
    人们常常用数字说明问题。像下面这些数字，也的确能够清楚地说明问题。今年上半年与去年上半年相比：社会主义国家生铁增产9％，钢增产10％，煤增产11％，石油增产15％；资本主义各国生铁减产19.6％，钢减产19.5％，煤减产9.1％，石油减产1.8％。一增一减，是如此的显眼。如果要选择一个最简明的符号，来最恰当地代表这两个阵营的话，我想只能用“＋”与“－”。“＋”号成了社会主义阵营的徽号，而“－”号成了资本主义阵营的象征了。社会主义的形势，被称为跃进，那末，资本主义阵营的形势，不也可以称之为跃退了?？
    然而数字还不是一切。如果看一看精神领域里的气象：社会主义阵营的人心向上，充满欢乐歌唱，西方世界里的人心颓唐，充满烦恼忧伤。社会主义制度在世界范围内对人心的吸引，资本主义制度在人心中所引起的厌恶情绪，又岂是数字所能表现的呢？

    老牛破车和“金龙”
    两大阵营的竞赛中，一年来最惹人注目的是两个社会主义大国，在某些产品的产量方面（其他方面早已超过）急起直追两个资本主义大国。自从苏联择定美国，中国择定英国，作为追赶的对手以来，这件事便一直吸引世界着人心。当初预定十五年左右为期，苏联要在工业产品上按人口平均赶上或超过美国。中国在主要工业产品的产量上赶上和超过英国。但是，只过了半年，我们中国方面就声明把更多一点时间改为更短一点时间。而在苏联，煤的产量去年就已经超过了美国。竞赛虽然还不能最后揭晓，但是上半年的结算，已表明了一种趋势。各以工业生产同去年同时期比较，苏联增10.5％，美国降10.8％；中国增34％，英国降2.1％。下半年，对我们两个大国来说，是比上半年更加跃进；而对美国和英国来说却是越加的不妙。一年之中，两个老牌资本主义大国，就已经被追得气喘呼呼的了。
    西方的报刊，说我们像一条金色巨龙一样，紧紧地追在约翰牛的后边。我们和苏联被称作金龙的确当之无愧，但是，英国和美国应该比作什么呢？约翰牛吗？几十年前还有些像，如今看来，它们比牛还走得慢。用老牛拖破车这句成语来形容它们，倒是很适当的。
