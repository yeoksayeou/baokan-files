Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission recently convened the National Athletes Training Work Conference in Beijing. More than 400 people attended the conference, including heads of the Physical Culture and Sports Commissions from 28 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, coaches, referees, and athlete representatives.

This conference exchanged experiences in athlete training work and unified understanding. The conference unanimously agreed that training work must emphasize politics and ensure the absolute leadership of the Party, and must correctly combine political and ideological education with physical training, basic technical training, and tactical training. Only in this way can sports technical level be rapidly improved. Many representatives, in their speeches at the conference, used vivid examples to illustrate that sports work can achieve results when politics are put in command. For example, the ice skating team of the Korean Middle School in Dunhua County, Jilin, under the education and leadership of the school's Party branch, understood the political significance of participating in sports, strengthening physical fitness, and improving sports performance to win glory for the motherland. Every athlete linked his or her actions with the Party's sports cause, thus generating soaring enthusiasm. Without ice skates, they made their own wooden skates. They ate the same food as ordinary students. They broke the superstition of "nutrition theory" and other myths, and carried out arduous, high-volume training every day after class. Finally, through hard work, they created the national record for the 1,500-meter women's speed skating. Now they are redoubling their efforts to prepare to challenge the world record in speed skating.

The conference believes that to do a good job in training, it is also necessary to continue to implement the spirit of rectification, oppose arrogance and squeamishness, promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, break down superstitions, and establish the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. Believing in "famous experts" and "famous coaches," and believing in dogmas, will bind one's own thinking and hinder the great leap forward. Training work must also rely closely on the masses, vigorously carry out mass movements, and vigorously carry out technical revolution.

    训练运动员要政治挂帅
    体委召开全国运动员训练工作会议
    新华社8日讯　体育运动委员会最近在北京召开了全国运动员训练工作会议。二十八个省、市、自治区的体委负责人、教练员、裁判员和运动员代表等共四百多人出席了这次会议。
    这次会议交流了运动员训练工作的经验，统一了认识。会议一致认为训练工作必须政治挂帅和保证党的绝对领导，必须把政治思想教育和身体训练、基本技术训练、战术训练正确地结合起来。只有这样，才可能飞速地提高运动技术水平。很多代表在大会发言中，以生动的事例说明了体育工作有了政治挂帅，就能出成绩。例如吉林敦化县朝鲜中学滑冰运动队，他们在学校党支部的教育和领导下，懂得参加体育运动、增强体质和提高运动成绩为祖国争光的政治意义，每个运动员把自己的行动和党的体育事业联系在一起，因此产生了冲天的干劲。没有冰鞋，他们就自制木板冰鞋。伙食也同一般学生吃得一样。他们破除了“营养论”等等的迷信，每天课余进行艰苦的大运动量训练，终于在苦练下创造了一千五百公尺女子速滑全国最高纪录。现在他们正在加倍努力，准备冲击速度滑冰的世界纪录。
    会议认为，搞好训练工作还必须继续贯彻整风精神，反对骄气、娇气，兴无灭资，破除迷信，树立敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格。迷信“名家”、“名教练”，迷信教条，就会束缚自己的思想，阻碍大跃进。训练工作还必须紧紧地依靠群众，大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命。
