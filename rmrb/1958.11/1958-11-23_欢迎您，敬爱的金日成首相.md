Welcome, Respected Premier Kim Il-sung
		Our Reporter
Beijing, the entire city welcomes the most beloved friend of the Chinese people.

The melodious welcoming music began. Premier Kim Il-sung, with the robust stride of a hero, stepped out of the train. Premier Zhou, with a smile, stepped forward to shake his hand warmly, exchanging cordial greetings. At that moment, firecrackers popped, gongs and drums thundered, and the welcoming crowd inside and outside the station cheered enthusiastically. Flower petals rained down like drizzle on the distinguished guest, and bouquets of flowers were presented to him. Many old friends reunited, their affection deepened. Vice Premier Peng Dehuai and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo grasped the hands of Vice Premier Nam Il, Minister of National Defense Kim Kwang-hyup, and others. Park Jung-ae recognized Li Dequan and Xu Guangping from the welcoming ranks, and they embraced and kissed. People were excited, jumping, and cheering the arrival of the envoys of friendship.

People from thousands of alleys throughout the city took to the streets and joined the welcoming ranks. Some came from beside their machines, some from in front of their counters, and some from classrooms and offices. Many elderly people with gray hair, supported by their children and grandchildren, also came. As Premier Kim Il-sung slowly passed by, only enthusiastic cheers could be heard, rolling over like a tsunami.

Comrade Feng Zhongyun, the former leader of the Anti-Japanese United Army and now Vice Minister of Water Resources and Electric Power, recounted to us the arduous struggle of the Chinese and Korean people against Japanese imperialism, and recalled the glorious achievements of Comrade Kim Il-sung in this struggle. He said excitedly: "We used to fight side by side against our common enemy. Today, we care for and support each other in the cause of building socialism. We will always be together!"

Generals Yang Yong and Wang Ping, who had recently returned from Korea, and many combat heroes also appeared in the welcoming ranks. Volunteer Army "Second-Class Hero" Captain Wang Huyuan arrived at the station very early. He told reporters about attending the Combat Heroes Congress of the Korean People's Army in Pyongyang shortly after the Korean War armistice, and his first meeting with Premier Kim Il-sung. Premier Kim Il-sung visited them at their accommodations, cared for them, and asked them, "Are you comfortable here?"

"Are you cold at night? Is the kang (heated platform bed) warm enough?" The Premier's concern for the Volunteer Army constantly inspired this hero's heart. He said: "I saw Chairman Mao not long after returning to China this year, and now I have seen Premier Kim again. It is truly a double blessing! I will always work hard to defend peace and promote the development of Sino-Korean friendship."

Along the route from the station to the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, 300,000 people converged into a magnificent human tide. Windows, rooftops, and scaffolding on construction sites were filled with people waving and cheering to the distinguished guests.

Premier Kim Il-sung, accompanied by Premier Zhou, rode out of the station in a Shanghai-made sky-blue convertible, and the workers and students lined up in the station square cheered. At this moment, the workers of the Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, standing east of the arrow tower, leaned forward and enthusiastically sang a newly composed song: "Welcome to the great Kim Il-sung, bringing friendship and peace. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is a guarantee of world peace, as evergreen as pine and cypress." As the car passed in front of them, the workers vigorously beat gongs and drums, rhythmically shouting: "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome Premier Kim Il-sung!" "Welcome to the Korean Government Delegation!" More than eighty steelworkers from the Beijing Steel Plant, upon hearing the news of Premier Kim Il-sung's arrival as they finished their shift at midnight last night, were so excited that they didn't want to sleep. They gathered and lined up before dawn to welcome him. Seeing the sea of people and colorful flags welcoming the distinguished guests, they couldn't suppress their inner excitement and took out their pens to describe their feelings in poetic language. Steelworker Yan Fuxing dedicated a poem to Premier Kim Il-sung that read:

"The morning sun is red and bright,
Welcoming Premier Kim Il-sung with delight.
Two nations advance side by side,
Fighting for peace, with hearts unified.
International friendship we'll never forget,
Back to our posts, better steel we'll get."

The cars carrying the distinguished guests slowly drove into Tiananmen Square, and the entire square erupted, the sounds of firecrackers, gongs, and drums mingling with the cheers of the people, like thunderous roars. Standing on high, one could see bouquets and colorful flags waving in the crowd, and colorful confetti flying in the air. Beside the Monument to the People's Heroes and on the Jinshui Bridge far from the receiving line, hats and headscarves were waved, and people enthusiastically cheered for the respected Premier Kim Il-sung with extreme excitement. The radiant Premier Kim Il-sung, passing through the smoke of firecrackers and the scattering of paper flowers, frequently waved to the cheering crowd. Four years ago, on the "National Day," Premier Kim Il-sung, together with Chairman Mao, reviewed the capital's people from Tiananmen Gate. Today, a different scene was presented before the distinguished guest. Tiananmen Square was piled high with building materials such as bricks, wood, sand, and stone, and towering building frames rose on both sides of the square. Countless people were densely packed on these "mountains" to welcome the distinguished guests. Construction workers waved willow-branch safety helmets on the cranes, welcoming the people's leader from the heroic country.

Premier Kim Il-sung arrived in front of the Beijing Institute of Telecommunications. The school's band played "The Song of General Kim Il-sung." To the music, the young people jumped and repeatedly shouted "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!" In this welcoming team, Lu Shizhe, a 21-year-old sophomore, had tears of excitement in his eyes when he saw Premier Kim Il-sung, and he raised his heels, constantly waving to the distinguished guest. Lu Shizhe volunteered to join the Korean War at the age of sixteen and was wounded in a severe winter. He entered the Sinpo Hospital in Korea, where Korean nurses fed him, dressed him, and carried him into air-raid shelters to avoid enemy planes, as if he were their little brother. The deep affection of the Korean people was deeply etched in this young man's heart. He said: "I will never forget those difficult years of friendship with the Korean people!"

In today's welcoming ranks, there were also many demobilized soldiers of the Volunteer Army working in various posts, some of whom had become workers, cadres, or students. Wu Chunying, a cadre from Yucai School, was originally a member of the Volunteer Army Cultural Troupe. She had met Premier Kim Il-sung twice during performances in Pyongyang and Beijing. Premier Kim Il-sung had watched her and other members of the troupe perform large choruses such as "The Song of Kim Il-sung" and "Heroes Conquer the Dadu River." Today, she stood in the marching ranks again to welcome the leader of the Korean people whom she knew so well. When Premier Kim Il-sung's car passed the welcoming ranks, she shouted with excitement: "Hello, Premier Kim Il-sung!"

Many workers from the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory who had returned from the Volunteer Army also came to welcome him. Rao Enhua, a worker who went to the Korean front in 1951 and was wounded in the home of a Korean old lady named Jin, came to the station early this morning, beating gongs and drums, to welcome Premier Kim Il-sung. Chen Zhenyang, a worker at the Wire and Cable Factory, worked as a medical worker on the Korean front since 1952. Today, he stood in the welcoming ranks as a skilled inspector, welcoming Premier Kim Il-sung, whom he had been looking forward to seeing day and night for several years. Mao Shusuo, a worker at the Beijing No. 1 Food Company, served as a demolition expert on the Korean front in 1951. He was awarded the Third Class Merit for fighting against American imperialism alongside the Korean People's Army. He said: "As a soldier who once fought side by side with the Korean people, I feel particularly honored to see Marshal Kim Il-sung in the capital of our motherland today."

Mothers who had sent their children to the Korean front came today with a victorious heart to welcome the envoy of the heroic Korean people. Guan Haihua, a family member of a Volunteer Army martyr, suffering from high blood pressure and feeling unwell, insisted on coming by car to welcome the Korean distinguished guests. Her son, Li Yu, had defended his position in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, charging seven times and killing and wounding a large number of enemies. He was awarded the title of Special Class Hero. She went to welcome the Volunteer Army delegation when they returned triumphantly, and today she came to welcome the Korean distinguished guests. She said with enthusiasm: "I saw the Volunteer Army return not long ago, and today I welcome the Korean leader. I am very happy. The Korean War was victorious, and the paper tiger of the United States was pierced by our two peoples." Guan Haihua, who was awarded the title of Model Family Member of Martyrs, also said: "Seeing the victory of the Chinese and Korean people today, my son's bloodshed is glorious, and I, as a mother, also feel honored and proud." In the ranks of residents of Chongwen District streets, there were elderly people with white hair and beards. However, they seemed more enthusiastic than the young people in welcoming the Korean government delegation headed by Premier Kim Il-sung. Zhao Xichen, an old man with a silver beard hanging down his chest, was already sixty-seven years old. Last night, when he learned that he would have the opportunity to welcome Premier Kim Il-sung, he was so happy that he didn't sleep well all night. This morning, just after six o'clock, he was busy on the street, greeting his neighbors and welcoming him together.

The bright sun of early winter shone on the long motorcade, shining with brilliance. When the distinguished guests arrived at East Chang'an Street and Taijichang, middle school students and street residents ran out of the welcoming ranks, waving colorful flags and scattering paper flowers. Students of the "Kim Il-sung Class" in the first year of high school at Beijing No. 5 Middle School, each wearing a class badge with the words "Kim Il-sung Class" in both Chinese and Korean, were shining brightly today. When Premier Kim Il-sung, accompanied by Premier Zhou, drove past their ranks in a convertible, everyone couldn't help but cheer and say in unison: "I saw the Premier!" The "Kim Il-sung Class" was born in 1950, when the U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea. After the students of the first class to receive the glorious title graduated, the school named the most outstanding class "Kim Il-sung Class," which has now been passed down to the fourth session. For eight years, under the care and encouragement of Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean people, they have continued to grow stronger. In the classroom of this class, there is a letter signed by Premier Kim Il-sung in 1953, congratulating the students on their greater achievements in learning and work. With such a close relationship, how could they be calm when they heard the news of the Premier's visit to Beijing? In order to report their achievements to the Premier and send gifts, the young people put a lot of effort. Wang Lin, Zhao Minwei, and Zhang Jiashan, a group of boys who had never done needlework before, ignored their fingers being pricked by the needles several times, and carefully embroidered the eight characters "Sino-Korean Friendship Lasts Forever" on a satin in a week. The whole class also presented the products of their work-study program - fried steel, refractory bricks, asbestos wool, and the all-excellent red flag awarded by the school - as the most precious gifts to Premier Kim Il-sung. On the glass box containing the gifts, they wrote: "The Party's General Line is the beacon that guides us. Your shining name is the source of our strength..." Chen Guiling, a 19-year-old female student in the third year of high school at Beijing No. 5 Girls' Middle School, heard last night that she was going to welcome Premier Kim Il-sung. She thought about how to tell her Korean girlfriend, Li Dongyu, whom she had not yet met, about this happy event. She decided to write about it in detail in her letter so that Li Dongyu could share her glory and joy.

How did Chen Guiling "meet" Li Dongyu? It turned out that Chen Guiling had long hoped to make friends with Korean comrades. This summer vacation, she met Li Dongyu through the introduction of Che Jiaying, a female medical worker in the Volunteer Army. Li Dongyu, Che Jiaying's good friend in middle school, had repeatedly urged her to introduce her to a Chinese friend after returning to China. In this way, Chen Guiling became a good friend of the Korean girl Li Dongyu. Recently, Li Dongyu wrote in a letter that she had graduated from high school and was about to participate in educational work. She also said that it would be great if the three of them could meet one day. She also sent a family photo in the letter. Chen Guiling said: "I met this Korean friend when welcoming the Volunteer Army relatives back to China, and now I welcome the respected Premier Kim Il-sung. What a great happy event this is!" Here they come, Premier Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou Enlai, shoulder to shoulder, in a convertible. The students lined up in front of the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse were ecstatic, waving the national flags of China and Korea, shouting "Welcome Premier Kim Il-sung," some students beating gongs and drums, and some climbing onto the roof to set off firecrackers. In the welcoming team of the Central University for Nationalities, composed of thirty-one minority students, many girls dressed in various ethnic costumes ran out and scattered handfuls of flower petals on Premier Kim Il-sung. Li Hongfan, a Korean student from Yanbian, told people about the story of Premier Kim Il-sung and the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people participating in the Chinese anti-Japanese struggle. He said: In the difficult years of resisting Japanese aggression, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives to assist the Chinese revolution. In Wolong Township, Helong County, Jilin Province, there is still a Korean girl named Jin buried. She was a communist party member, and she was captured by the Japanese invaders in 1932. In order to prevent the enemy from obtaining any secrets of the anti-Japanese organization, she bit off her own tongue and ten fingers with her mouth. The great internationalist spirit of this Korean martyr is forever engraved in the hearts of the Chinese people.

Yes, the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is a fighting brother's friendship, a friendship forged with blood that will last forever!

The cars carrying the distinguished guests, filled with the cheers from the bottom of the hearts of the people, drove into the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. The sounds of joy and songs are still echoing in the air:

"In the east of this world………………
Ah, Beijing - Pyongyang
Beijing - Pyongyang
Two places, one ideal
This ideal is already a huge wave
Surging in the East."

Listen, this is the voice of the Chinese and Korean people with their hearts linked together, this is the voice of the two peoples united into one force. (Attached picture)

    欢迎您，敬爱的金日成首相
    本报记者
    北京，举城在欢迎中国人民最敬爱的朋友。
    悠扬的迎宾乐曲响起来了。金日成首相迈着英雄的健步走出列车，周总理含笑上前同他热烈地握手，亲切地互相问候。这时，鞭炮齐鸣，锣鼓震天，车站内外欢迎的人热情欢呼，鲜花瓣像细雨一样洒落在贵宾的身上，一簇簇鲜花送到贵宾的手里。许多老友又重逢了，倍加亲切。彭德怀副总理、郭沫若副委员长紧紧握着南日副首相、金光侠民族保卫相等人的手。朴正爱从欢迎行列中认出李德全、许广平等，她们拥抱亲吻。人们激动着，跳跃着，欢呼友谊使者的光临。
    人们从全城千百条胡同走上街头，涌进了欢迎的行列。有的来自机床旁，有的来自柜台前，有的走出课堂和办公室。多少白发苍苍的老人扶着儿孙也来了。当金日成首相缓缓走过时，只听得忘情的欢呼，像海啸滚滚而过。
    当年抗日联军的领导者之一、现在的水利电力部副部长冯仲云同志向我们追述了中朝人民反抗日本帝国主义的艰苦斗争，追述了在这一斗争中金日成同志的光辉的战绩。他兴奋地说道：“我们过去曾经为了反对我们共同的敌人而并肩战斗过，今天我们又在建设社会主义的事业中互相关怀和支持，我们永远在一起！”
    从朝鲜归国不久的杨勇上将、王平上将和许多战斗英雄也都出现在欢迎的行列里。志愿军“二级英雄”王虎元上尉，很早就来到车站，他向记者谈起在朝鲜刚停战时，他到平壤市参加朝鲜人民军战友战斗英雄大会、第一次会见金日成首相的情景。金日成首相到他们住宿的地方，看望他们，问他们“在这里住习惯不习惯？”
  “夜里睡觉冷不冷，炕热不热？”首相对志愿军部队的关心，时刻激励着这位英雄的心。他说：“今年回国以后看到毛主席不久，又看到了金首相，真是双喜临门，我将要永远为了保卫和平，为了中朝友谊的发展而努力工作。”
    从车站到迎宾馆的沿途，三十万人汇成波澜壮阔的人流。在楼窗、墙头以及建筑工地的脚手架上，都挤满了人，向贵宾们招手欢呼。
    金日成首相在周总理陪同下乘上海蓝色的敞篷汽车驶出车站，排列在车站广场上的工人、学生都欢跃起来。这时，站在箭楼东面的北京第二机床厂的工人们，一面俯冲着上身，一面热情地唱起了刚编成的一首歌曲：“欢迎您伟大的金日成，带来了友谊与和平。中朝人民的友谊，世界和平的保证，像松柏一样万古长青。”当汽车驶过他们面前的时候，工人们使劲地敲着锣鼓，有节奏地高呼：“欢迎！”“欢迎！”“欢迎金日成首相！”“欢迎朝鲜政府代表团！”北京钢厂八十多个炼钢工人在昨晚十二时下班时，听到欢迎金日成首相的消息，都兴奋得不想睡觉了。他们在天还没亮就集合整队来欢迎。他们看到人山人海，彩旗满街欢迎贵宾的景象，压制不住内心的激动，纷纷掏出钢笔，用诗的语言来描述自己的心情。炼钢工人阎福兴献给金日成首相的一首诗这样写着：
    “早晨太阳红通通，欢迎首相金日成。
    两国人民齐跃进，　并肩作战卫和平。
    国际友谊永不忘，　回到岗位炼好钢。”
    贵宾们乘坐的汽车，缓缓地驶进了天安门广场，顿时全场沸腾，鞭炮声、锣鼓声交和着人们的欢呼声，如同雷鸣般的震响起来。站在高处望去，只见人群中花束、彩旗挥动，五颜六色的纸屑在空中飞舞。在人民英雄纪念碑旁和远离迎道的金水桥上，也有帽子和头巾挥动，人们以万分激动的心情热烈地向敬爱的金日成首相欢呼。神采奕奕的金日成首相，穿过鞭炮的烟雾弥漫和纸花纷飞的迎道，频频向欢呼的人群招手致意。四年前的“十一”，金日成首相曾在天安门城楼上，和毛主席一起检阅过首都人民的队伍，今天呈现在贵宾眼前的是另一番景象了。天安门广场上砖、木、沙、石等各种建筑材料堆积如山，广场两侧耸立起了高入云霄的建筑架，无数的人密密层层的拥挤在这一座座的“山”上欢迎贵宾的来临，建筑工人们在起重机上，挥舞着柳条安全帽，欢迎来自英雄国度的人民领袖。
    金日成首相来到了北京电讯学院的队伍面前，这个学校的乐队演奏起了“金日成将军之歌”。和着这乐曲青年们跳跃着一再高呼“中朝两国人民的友谊万岁！”在这支欢迎贵宾的队伍里，二十一岁的二年级学生卢世哲，看到金日成首相时，两眼含着激动的泪花，跷起两个脚后跟，不住的向贵宾挥手。卢世哲十六岁志愿入朝，当年在一个严冬里负伤，进了朝鲜的新坡医院，在医院里朝鲜的护士像对自己的小弟弟一样给他喂饭、穿衣服，背着他进防空洞躲避敌机。朝鲜人民的深情厚意深刻地铭记在这个青年人的心里。他说：“我将永世不忘和朝鲜人民友谊相处的那些艰苦的岁月！”
    在今天的欢迎队伍里，还有许多在各种岗位上工作的志愿军复员军人，他们有的已成了工人，有的成了干部或学生。育才学校干部吴春英本来是志愿军文工团的团员，她曾经在平壤、北京两次演出中见过金日成首相，金日成首相曾经看过她和其他文工团员们演唱的“金日成之歌”、“英雄们战胜了大渡河”等大合唱，今天她又站在游行队伍里欢迎她所熟识的朝鲜人民的领袖，当金日成首相的车子经过欢迎队伍时，她又激动又兴奋地高喊“金日成首相好！”
    北京电子管厂许多从志愿军复员归来的工人也来欢迎。1951年就去朝鲜前线，曾在朝鲜金老大娘家养过伤的工人饶恩华，今天他一早就打着锣鼓来到车站迎接金日成首相。有线电厂工人陈振扬从1952年开始就在朝鲜前线搞医务工作，今天他以一个熟练的检验工人的身份站在欢迎队伍里，迎接几年来日夜盼望见到的金日成首相。北京第一食品公司工人毛书锁，1951年在朝鲜前线当过爆破手，他在同朝鲜人民军一道打击美帝国主义中，获得过三等功。他说：“作为曾经同朝鲜人民并肩作战过的军人，今天能在祖国首都见到金日成元帅，我感到特别光荣。”
    曾把儿女送到朝鲜前线的妈妈们，今天怀着胜利的心情来欢迎英雄的朝鲜人民的使者。志愿军烈士家属关海华患着高血压症，身体又不舒服，她坚持坐车赶来欢迎朝鲜贵宾。她儿子李玉在抗美援朝战争中曾经坚守阵地，七次冲锋，杀伤了大量的敌人，被评为特等功臣。志愿军代表团凯旋归国时，她去欢迎了，今天她又来欢迎朝鲜贵宾，她满腔热情地说：不久前我看到志愿军回来，今天又欢迎朝鲜的领袖，心里十分高兴。朝鲜战争胜利了，美国这只纸老虎被我们两国人民戳穿了。这位被评为烈属模范的关海华又说：看到今天中朝人民的胜利，我儿子的流血是光荣的，我做母亲的也感到光荣和骄傲。崇文区街道居民的队伍里，有须发苍苍的老年人。但是，他们为欢迎以金日成首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团，却显得比青年人更加热情。银须垂胸的赵希臣老大爷已经是六十七岁的高龄了。昨夜当他知道自己能有机会来欢迎金日成首相时，高兴得一夜没睡好，今晨刚过六点钟，他就在街上忙碌起来，招呼左邻右舍，一起前来欢迎。
    初冬的艳阳照射着长长的汽车行列，闪出一片光彩。贵宾们到了东长安街和台基厂一带时，中、小学生和街道居民纷纷从欢迎的队伍中跑出来，挥着彩旗，撒出纸花。北京市第五中学高中一年级“金日成班”的学生们，今天每个人胸前佩戴的缀有“金日成班”中、朝两种文字的班徽在闪闪发光。当金日成首相在周总理陪同下乘着敞篷车驶过他们的队伍时，大伙禁不住雀跃起来，异口同声地说：“我见到首相了！”“金日成班”是在1950年，正当美帝发动侵朝战争时诞生的，第一个获得光荣称号的班级的学生毕业以后，学校就把最优秀的班级命名为“金日成班”，现在已经传到第四届了。八年来，他们在金日成首相和朝鲜人民的关怀和鼓舞下，不断地茁壮成长起来。就在这个班的教室里，挂着金日成首相在1953年亲笔签名的信，他祝贺学生们在学习和工作中获得更大的成绩。有着这样亲密的关系，当他们听到首相来京的消息，心里怎么会平静呢。为了向首相汇报成绩，致送礼物，年轻人煞费苦心。王麟、赵民伟和张家善这帮男孩子从来也不会做针线活，这会却不顾自己的手指好几次被针扎出了血，用一个礼拜的时间，精心地在一方缎子上刺绣了“中朝友谊万古长青”八个大字。全班还把勤工俭学中的产品——炒钢、耐火砖、石棉绒，还有学校奖给的全优红旗，作为最珍贵的礼物送给金日成首相。在装礼物的玻璃盒上他们这样写着：“党的总路线，是我们指路的明灯。您的光辉的名字，是我们力量的源泉……”。北京第五女子中学高中三年级十九岁的女学生陈桂玲，昨晚听说要欢迎金日成首相，夜里就考虑怎样把这件喜事告诉给还没见过面的朝鲜女朋友李东玉，她决定要在信上把这件事写得详详细细的，让李东玉也分享她的光荣和欢乐。
    陈桂玲是怎么“认识”李东玉的呢？原来，陈桂玲很早以前就盼望和朝鲜同志做朋友。今年暑假，她经过志愿军女医务人员车家营的介绍结识了李东玉。车家营的在中学念书的好朋友李东玉曾再三叮咛她回国后一定再给她介绍一位中国朋友，就这样，陈桂玲成了朝鲜姑娘李东玉的好朋友，最近李东玉来信说她已经高中毕业将要参加教育工作，她并且说，要是有一天她们三人能见面在一起该多好。信里还寄来了全家照片。陈桂玲说：欢迎志愿军亲人回国时我结识了这位朝鲜朋友，现在我又欢迎了敬爱的金日成首相，这是件多么大的喜事啊！来了，金日成首相和周恩来总理肩并肩地乘着敞篷汽车过来了，排在迎宾馆门前的学生们欢喜若狂，一个个挥舞着中朝两国国旗，高呼“欢迎金日成首相”的口号，有的学生敲锣击鼓，有的爬上楼顶燃放鞭炮。三十一个少数民族学生组成的中央民族学院欢迎队伍里，穿着各色民族服装的许多姑娘们跑出来，把一把一把的鲜花花瓣撒到金日成首相身上。来自延边的朝鲜族学生李洪范，向人们讲述金日成首相和朝鲜人民的优秀儿女参加中国抗日斗争的故事，他说：在反抗日本侵略的艰苦岁月里，朝鲜人民的优秀儿女不惜牺牲自己的生命援助中国革命。吉林省和龙县卧龙乡至今还埋葬着一位姓金的朝鲜姑娘，她是个共产党员，1932年被日本侵略者抓住了，她为了不让敌人得到一点抗日组织的秘密，用自己的嘴把自己的舌头和十个手指头咬断了。这位朝鲜烈士的伟大的国际主义精神永远铭刻在中国人民的心里。
    是的，中朝人民的友谊，是战斗的兄弟的友谊，是用鲜血凝结起来的万世长青的友谊！
    贵宾们乘坐的汽车满载着人群发自内心的欢呼驶进迎宾馆。欢乐声、歌声依然在空中荡漾：
    “在这世界的东方………………
    啊，北京——平壤
    北京——平壤
    两个地方一个理想
    这个理想已是巨浪
    汹涌奔流在东方”。
    听，这是中朝人民心连心的声音，这是两国人民团结成一个力量的声音。（附图片）
