Holding the "Constitution" in one hand and the butcher's knife in the other
French colonists brutally harm Algerian patriots
Bousouf refuses to be a puppet parliamentarian and is burned to death

    This newspaper reports that news from Algeria indicates that French colonial authorities are strengthening their bloody suppression in order to maintain their colonial rule in Algeria.

    Recently, in a village north of Constantine, French troops forced an Algerian leader, Bousouf, to run as a candidate for the current parliamentary seat under the provisions of de Gaulle's "Constitution." When Bousouf refused, they burned him alive in front of his five children. In addition, de Gaulle has ordered an offensive of threats, imprisonment and massacre against the Algerian people, and has arrested and imprisoned a large number of people.

    This inhumane atrocity by the French colonial authorities has been strongly condemned by Middle Eastern public opinion. In a commentary broadcast on the evening of the 9th, Iraqi Republic Radio exposed and condemned the recent crimes committed by the imperialists in Algeria. The commentary pointed out that the French ruling clique and all imperialists headed by the American imperialists will be tried for these crimes, because without the weapons of the aggressive Atlantic Treaty Organization and the assistance and support of American imperialism, the war waged by the French colonists in Algeria cannot continue. The commentary pointed out that these crimes prove that imperialism is in a dying state. The Hitlerites once killed a large number of freedom fighters, but they could not prevent the coming of their final collapse.

    Cairo's "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 10th, strongly condemning the brutal acts of the French colonialists. The editorial said that France must pay the full price for its new shameful act. France should be punished for this.

    一手拿“宪法”　一手执屠刀
    法国殖民者残害阿爱国者
    布苏夫拒当傀儡议员竟被烧死
    本报讯　来自阿尔及利亚的消息表明，法国殖民当局为了维护在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治，正在加强血腥镇压。
    最近，法国军队在君士坦丁北边的一个乡村里，强迫一位阿尔及利亚领袖布苏夫根据戴高乐“宪法”的规定作为本届议会议员的候选人。布苏夫拒绝了他们，他们就当着他的五个孩子的面把他活活烧死。此外，戴高乐还下令对阿尔及利亚人民发动一个威胁、监禁和屠杀的攻势，并且已经逮捕和监禁了大批人民。
    法国殖民当局的这种灭绝人性的暴行，受到中东舆论的强烈谴责。伊拉克共和国电台在9日晚间广播的评论中，揭露并且谴责帝国主义者最近在阿尔及利亚干出的罪行。评论指出，法国统治集团和以美帝国主义者为首的所有帝国主义分子都将因为这些罪行而受审，因为如果没有侵略性的大西洋公约集团的武器和美帝国主义的援助和支持，法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚进行的战争是不能继续下去的。评论指出，这些罪恶证明，帝国主义是处在垂死状态中。希特勒分子曾经大量杀死自由战士，但是，他们并不能阻止最后崩溃的命运的来临。
    开罗“人民报”在10日发表社论，强烈谴责法国殖民主义者的残暴行为。社论说，一定要使法国对它所干出的新的可耻行为付出全部代价。应该使法国为这件事情受到惩罚。
