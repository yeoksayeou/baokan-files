Two Important Links
Liaoning Provincial Construction Department Wang Zeqi

Fast construction in Liaoning Province is currently developing from individual points to a broader scale. Based on our experience, in organizing rapid construction, in addition to putting politics in command, launching a large-scale mass movement, and conducting engineering scheduling and batch construction, we must also grasp the following two important links:

First, expand the scope of prefabrication and installation, and adopt factory-based, mechanized, and semi-mechanized construction. Its main advantages are: changing some high-altitude operations to ground operations, making operation convenient, efficient, and safe; expanding the working surface of various types of work, allowing for simultaneous progress; and at the same time, most components can be processed into semi-finished and finished products indoors, unaffected by the climate, reducing idle work. Experience has proven that expanding prefabrication and installation requires the development of lifting and installation forces. In lifting and installation, we must adopt methods that make use of local resources where available, use foreign methods where available, and combine local and foreign methods.

Second, maximize the working surface as much as possible and organize parallel three-dimensional cross-operations. It can fully spread out the entire project, put all projects into production, interweave various processes closely, and eliminate stagnation points. In building construction projects, layered, segmented, cyclical flow can be implemented. In industrial plant construction projects, the bay-by-bay hoisting method is implemented. First, the prefabricated columns, large beams, etc., are continuously hoisted section by section. After one section is installed, wall building, equipment foundation excavation, pipeline laying, and installation of other auxiliary equipment can be carried out simultaneously, without waiting for the exterior walls and roof to be built before proceeding with other work.

    两个重要环节

    辽宁省的快速施工目前正由点到面的发展着。根据我们的经验，在组织快速施工中，除要政治挂帅，大搞群众运动和进行工程排队分批施工外，还必须抓住以下两个重要环节：
    第一、扩大预制安装范围，采用工厂化、机械化、半机械化施工。其主要优点是：使一部分高空作业改为地面作业，操作方便，效率高，安全；扩大了各个工种的作业面，可齐头并进；同时可以将大部分构件在室内加工成半成品和成品，不受气候影响，减少了窝工。经验证明，扩大预制安装，必须发展起重安装力量。在起重安装上必须采取有土用土，有洋用洋，土洋结合的办法。
    第二、尽量扩大作业面，组织平行立体交叉作业。它可使整个工程全面铺开，各个工程全部投入生产，各个工序相互穿插，紧密衔接，消灭停歇点。在楼房工程上，可实行分层分段循环流水。在工业厂房工程上，实行节间吊装法，首先把预制的柱子、大梁等逐节连续吊装，安装一节之后，就可以同时进行砌墙、挖设备基础、铺设管道和安装其他一些辅助设备，不必等外墙和房盖建成，再去进行其他工作。
