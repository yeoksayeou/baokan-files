    A Wave in the Cultural High Tide
    —On the Cultural Activities in Beiyinpo Village, Dengfeng County, Henan
    Deng Wen
    Nestled at the foot of the Funiu Mountains, there's a village of over two hundred households, renowned as Dengfeng County's cultural village: Beiyinpo.

    "In the old days of Beiyinpo, the poor suffered greatly." In the old society, the masses of this village were exploited by eight local tyrants, resulting in many fleeing famine, many selling coal, many being illiterate, and many poor people having no land to till.

    Now, as soon as you step into this village, you'll sense a strong cultural atmosphere. At the village entrance and along the main roads, groups of male and female commune members head to the fields, tools on their shoulders, newspapers and books in hand, talking, laughing, walking, and reading. The mud walls in the village, whitewashed with lime, are adorned with vibrant paintings full of realism and romanticism. One painting depicts a child pushing a cart laden with a large, bright red peach, another shows three people climbing ladders into the clouds to peel a plump ear of corn. Various designs abound. Besides the murals, the most common sight here is small blackboards, almost every household possessing five or six. These blackboards are found at the gate, in the courtyard, in the main room, in the kitchen, even on the wall beside the bed, and on the toilet wall. During the literacy campaign, these small blackboards served as tools to reinforce character recognition. Now, the blackboards are filled with poems composed by the peasants themselves, with phonetic symbols alongside the poems. The peasants all carry pens, diaries, and newspapers in their pockets.

    Under the leadership of the Party, after two literacy campaigns and three months of diligent study, all young and middle-aged illiterates were eliminated by the first month of this year, and by August, some elderly and young illiterates were also eradicated. Now, all the peasants in the village have shed the label of illiteracy, achieving a state where everyone can write, everyone can read newspapers, and everyone attends school to learn culture. Many elderly people also attend the people's school every day, leaning on their canes and wearing glasses.

    After the people mastered culture, they composed a large number of folk songs and rhythmic verses. Not only are the rhymes beautiful and the language vivid, but the ideology is also very high. Just as one poem describes: "Hundreds and thousands of peasant writers, gather at the cultural mountain, their pens like orchards, bearing fruit and bending branches." There is also a poem praising this village: "Beiyinpo, Beiyinpo, many poets in Beiyinpo village, eighty-year-olds write poems, children can create. Culture returns to the people's hands, everyone surpasses Su Dongpo." Peasant poet Bai Guiyong, who is sixty-three years old this year, only shook off his illiteracy this spring. Now he is studying in an amateur middle school. This old peasant studies with great enthusiasm. Afraid of being disturbed by his grandchildren, he secretly goes down to the sweet potato cellar to study. This year he has composed more than a hundred folk songs, and the county has recommended him as a member of the Henan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. He has a folk song that "expresses his feelings": "Everyone says I am old, but although I am old, my heart is not old. I am like a withered vine meeting rain, I must learn from the old Liang Hao, Liang Hao became a top scholar at eighty, my age is younger than him, he studied to become an official, I study to improve my skills." Not only does he compose, but his daughter-in-law and granddaughter can also compose. All three have entered amateur middle school. People call Bai Guiyong's family: "Three generations of middle school students."

    In Beiyinpo, men and women, young and old, compete with each other to write and recite poetry. Poetry has become their everyday language, and a powerful tool for praising the advanced and criticizing the backward. After graduating from literacy class, the old farmer Ma Youcai felt that being able to read newspapers and write letters was enough and that he didn't need to study anymore. His son, Ma Depo, who was his classmate, wrote a rhythmic verse at home to criticize him: "Listen to me, father, let me talk about studying. You just graduated from literacy class, and you think you've learned all the culture. Learning is like rowing against the current, it's easy to fall behind, hard to advance. If you don't study for another half year, you'll forget everything you've learned. I hope you continue to study hard." Ma Youcai really listened to his son and went to school with his books. Wen Jinhuan is Bai Xuemin's wife. After literacy, Bai Xuemin thought that it was enough for women to know a little, and they didn't need to go to school anymore. When entering the higher primary class, he bought two new diaries, wrote his name on them, but didn't buy one for Wen Jinhuan. Knowing this, Jinhuan immediately wrote a poem on the small blackboard: "Caring only for yourself and not others, how can I learn culture without a diary?" After seeing it, Bai Xuemin immediately gave his wife a new diary.

    In Beiyinpo Village, these little poems and stories are produced every day, every hour. In the past six months, they have written more than 78,000 rhythmic verses and folk songs, more than 30 communications and feature articles, and more than a dozen small plays.

    Beiyinpo, like all parts of our motherland, is undergoing profound changes, drawing new and beautiful pictures on a blank sheet of paper. A poem describes it well: "Beiyinpo is a cultural slope, folk songs sung all day long, the sound of reading is like thunder, pens fly and ink dances, many poems, every household reads books, men and women, young and old, can write, culture returns to the people's hands, poetry becomes an ocean, songs become a river."

    文化高潮中的浪花
    ——记河南登封县背阴坡村的文化活动
    登文
    在伏牛山背面的山角下，有个二百多户的村子，这就是登封县的有名的文化村——背阴坡。
      “昔日的背阴坡，贫苦穷人多”。在旧社会里，这个村的群众受着八大土豪的压榨剥削，没吃逃荒人多、卖煤人多、不识字的多、穷人没地种的多。
    现在，你只要踏进这个村子，就会感到浓厚的文化气息。在村头上、大路上，一群群的男女社员下地去，肩扛工具，手拿书报，说着笑着，走着看着。村里用白石灰粉饰过的土墙上，到处是色彩鲜艳的充满现实主义和浪漫主义情调的画。有一幅画着一个儿童用车子推着一个大鲜红桃子，有一幅画着三个人上梯子到云里去剥一穗肥大的玉米穗子。各种各样。除了壁画以外，这里最多见的是小黑板，差不多每家都有五、六块。大门口、当院里、堂屋里、厨房、甚至床一边的墙上，厕所的墙上都是小黑板。在扫盲的时候，这些小黑板作巩固生字的工具。而现在小黑板上都是农民自己编的诗歌。在诗歌的一旁还用拼音字母注上音。农民们人人口袋里装有钢笔、日记本和书报。
    在党的领导下，全体农民经过两次扫盲运动和三个月的苦学苦练，在今年正月已经把青壮年文盲全部扫除，到今年8月又把一些老幼文盲也全部扫除。现在全村农民都摘掉文盲帽，达到人人会写作，人人会看报，人人都入学学文化。许多老年人也都每天扶着拐杖戴着眼镜到民校学习。
    人民掌握了文化以后，编写了大量的民歌快板。不但音韵优美，语言生动，思想性也非常高。正像一首诗描写的一样：“农民作家上百千，群英会师文化山，笔杆尤如花果林，结出桃李枝压弯。”还有歌颂这村的诗是：“背阴坡，背阴坡，背阴坡村诗人多，八十老公写诗篇，几岁玩童会创作。文化回到人民手，人人赛过苏东坡。”农民诗人白贵永，今年已经六十三岁了，他也是今年春天才摘掉文盲帽子，现在入了业余中学学习，这个老农民学习起来真是精神饱满。怕孙子们吵他，他偷偷下到红芋窖里学习，今年他编了民歌百余首，县里已把他推为河南省文联会员，他有一首自己“抒怀”的民歌是：“人人都说我年老，看我年老我心不老，我好像枯藤逢吹雨，一定要学老梁灏，梁灏八十中状元，我的年龄比他小，他读书为的状元官，我读书为的技术高”。不但他编，他媳妇，他孙女都会编，三人都一同入了业余中学。人称白贵永家是：“三代中学生”。
    在背阴坡，男女老少互相比赛写诗诵诗，诗歌成了他们谈话中的口头语，诗歌成了表扬先进、批评落后的有力工具。老农民麻有才扫盲毕业后，觉得能看报写信，不用再学习了。他儿子麻德坡和他是同学，就在家里写了一首快板批评他：“叫父亲听我言，我把学习谈一谈，扫盲你才毕了业，你觉着文化全学完，学习好比逆行船，后退容易，前进难，你再有半年不学习，你所学的全忘完，希望你继续上学苦钻研。”麻有才着实听了儿子的话，拿着书本上学去了。文金环是白学敏的妻子，扫盲以后，白学敏心里想，妇女识点字就行了，不必再上学。在升入高小班时，他自己买了两本新日记本，写上自己的名字，没给文金环买。金环知道后，马上在小黑板上写了一首诗：“只管自己不管人家，没有日记本怎能学文化？”白学敏看后，马上给爱人一本新日记本。
    在背阴坡村，像这种小诗话、故事，每天每时都在产生着。这半年来，他们写出了快板民歌七万八千多首，通讯、特写三十多首，小剧本十几个。
    背阴坡和我们祖国各地一样，正在起着深刻的变化，在白纸上画上了又新又美的图画。有一首诗描写得好：“背阴坡文化坡，民歌唱的日不落，读书声音风雷动，笔飞墨舞诗歌多，家家户户把书读，男女老少会写作，文化回到人民手，诗成江海歌成河”。
