    A New Stage in the International Communist Movement
    —The First Anniversary of the Moscow Meeting and Declaration of Communist and Workers’ Parties of All Countries
    Last November, when representatives of Communist and Workers’ parties from all over the world gathered in Moscow to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, at the initiative of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers’ parties from twelve socialist countries was held from the 14th to the 16th, and a meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers’ parties from sixty-four countries was held from the 16th to the 19th. These two meetings of great historical significance adopted two declarations of great historical significance. Now, a year has passed since the Moscow Meeting and the Moscow Declaration. The Declaration of the Communist and Workers’ Parties of the Twelve Socialist Countries, because it summarized the experiences of the international communist movement over the past century, especially the past forty years, and because it was later endorsed by the Communist Parties of capitalist countries, has actually become the program of the international communist movement for the coming period. The Peace Declaration of the sixty-four Communist and Workers’ Parties, because it reflected the strong will of the people of the world to defend peace, has become a clarion call to guide the people of the world to unite and stop war and maintain peace. Over the past year, it has become clearer to people that this broadest international meeting of Communist and Workers’ parties from all over the world since the dissolution of the Communist International, due to the fact that it laid a new ideological and political foundation for the unity of the international communist movement, has indeed begun a new stage in the international communist movement.
    This year, the contrast between the prosperity of the socialist camp and the decline of the imperialist camp is particularly stark. No matter how the imperialists and modern revisionists trumpet that capitalism can escape crises, the monstrous waves of severe periodic economic crises have once again swept across the major capitalist countries. No matter how the imperialists and modern revisionists ridicule the planned economy and the enthusiasm of the people in socialist countries, the entire socialist camp is full of prosperity and high-speed development. Compared with the same period last year, the total industrial output of the United States decreased by 10.8%, while the total industrial output of the Soviet Union increased by 10.5%. British industrial production continued to decline after three years of stagnation, while China's industrial production soared. Compared with the same period last year, the industrial production of the socialist camp increased by an average of 13%, while that of the five countries of the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, and Japan decreased by an average of 4.6%. The proportion of industrial output of socialist countries in the world's total industrial output has increased from about 33% last year to 38%-40% this year. This year, both the Soviet Union and China have made great leaps in agriculture: the Soviet Union has had an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain, and China has created the unprecedented miracle of doubling grain and cotton production. As for science and technology, the Soviet Union has already surpassed and will continue to surpass the United States. The Soviet Union's third huge artificial earth satellite—a veritable cosmic automated scientific laboratory—is still operating in space. Its first geophysical rocket launched for the second time this year reached an altitude of 450 kilometers and accurately returned to the designated location. The United States can only sigh at the “sky.” These scenes show that in the peaceful competition, the socialist camp will definitely outstrip the decaying imperialist camp.
    This year, the struggle of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union to defend world peace and support the national independence movement has achieved great victories. The policy of aggression and expansion and the "brink of war" policy of the imperialist blocs, especially U.S. imperialism, have suffered heavy blows. The national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have developed unprecedentedly, turning the former imperialist "fiefdoms" into volcanoes under their feet. The situation of the imperialist aggressor forces in the two regions of the East—the Middle East region and the Taiwan Strait region—has further exposed the fatal weakness of their great ambitions but insufficient strength. The victory of the national revolution in Iraq broke the chains of imperialism in the Middle East. The U.S. and British imperialist conspiracies of interference and subversion against the Republic of Iraq have repeatedly been declared failures and are helpless. The U.S. and British troops, which pounced into Lebanon and Jordan with their teeth and claws, had to roll out with their tails between their legs. The military threats and war provocations carried out by U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait region have not only failed to intimidate the Chinese people, but have precisely played a role in mobilizing the Chinese people from the opposite side, and have put itself in an unprecedented political and moral isolation. The situation of the struggle over the past year shows that the only result of U.S. imperialism's pursuit of a policy of aggression and a policy of war everywhere is to put a noose around its own neck and be unable to escape, exposing its outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger form in the face of the power of the people of the world, and becoming the number one negative teacher in the world to educate the people.
    The Moscow Declaration pointed out that the unity of the Communist and Workers' parties of all countries, their unity with each other, and the unity of the socialist countries are the cores of all broader unity. Only by strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the unity of international communist movement headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, can we better unite all working people and progressive mankind, and unite all freedom-loving and peace-loving forces in the world. Since the Moscow Meeting, the unity of the Communist and Workers' parties of all countries and the unity of the socialist countries, whether in the struggle for peace, for socialism, and for the common cause of Marxism-Leninism, or in close exchanges, mutual understanding, and exchanges of experience, have made significant progress.
    The leaders of the Communist parties and governments of socialist countries have conducted extensive visits, talks, and meetings this year. In May of this year, a meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' parties of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance was held in Moscow to study the issue of expanding mutual assistance and cooperation in economic affairs between socialist countries. In June, representatives of Communist and Workers' parties from fifteen European countries held a meeting in Berlin to discuss common opposition to imperialist war policies and strive for European collective security and world peace. In August, the theoretical and reporting monthly "Problems of Peace and Socialism" of the Communist and Workers' parties was launched. In August, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev held talks in Beijing. These talks and the published joint communiqué were a serious blow to the imperialist aggressor forces and a new and great encouragement to the people of all countries who love peace and social progress.
    In addition, in February of this year, the Chinese government delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai visited Korea; in March, the Romanian government delegation led by Comrade Stoica visited China, Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia; in April, the Soviet party and government delegation led by Comrade Khrushchev visited Hungary, and Comrade Voroshilov visited Poland; in May, the Polish party and government delegation led by Comrade Gomulka visited Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania; in July, the Czechoslovak party and government delegation led by Comrade Novotny visited the Soviet Union; in October, the Polish party and government delegation led by Comrade Gomulka visited the Soviet Union.
    In this year, the Communist and Workers' parties of all countries have made the tide of the international communist movement even more magnificent with unremitting work. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has made great achievements in leading Soviet people in the construction of communism, and has made outstanding contributions in uniting all peace-loving forces in the world to dispel the clouds of war. The modern revisionists' anti-Soviet slanders cannot damage the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is the center of unity of the international communist movement, in the slightest. On the contrary, its prestige among the working people of the world has increased even more. The Twenty-First Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is being actively prepared for, and the inspiring indicators of the plan for the development of the Soviet national economy from 1959 to 1965, which will be adopted at this congress, will be an important milestone in the Soviet Union's accelerated communist construction. The Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people through the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, and victoriously carried out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. At the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC held in May of this year, a general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results was formulated. Under the illumination of this general line, a high tide of great ideological liberation of communism, a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a great development of the people's commune movement and the movement of the whole people as soldiers, and a combination of education and labor production has been set off across the country. Under the leadership of the Communist parties of various countries, the people of other socialist countries have also made great achievements in economic, political, and cultural aspects. This year, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and the German Socialist Unity Party have successively held their congresses, and these congresses have become the engines for uniting and mobilizing the people of these countries to accelerate the construction of socialism. The Communist parties of Asian, African, and Latin American countries are increasingly becoming the core of national unity in the national independence struggles of various countries. The Communist parties of the major capitalist countries have strengthened their unity and fighting spirit in the arduous struggle against the attacks of the reactionaries and against the sabotage of the revisionist elements. The French Communist Party is uniting and educating its own people to oppose de Gaulle's dictatorial rule and defend the French republican system. The Italian Communist Party achieved a brilliant victory in the general election in May of this year. The Finnish Communist Party and its allies also achieved the status of the largest party in the parliamentary elections. The Japanese Communist Party is uniting the Japanese people to launch a massive movement against the Kishi Nobusuke government's pursuit of the U.S. aggressive policy and the revival of Japanese militarism, and is fighting for Japan's independence, democracy, and peace. The U.S. Communist Party has regained its fighting power after clearing out revisionist elements such as Gates. After criticizing the Larsen revisionist group and expelling Larsen from the party, the Danish Communist Party is more orderly. After clearing out the traitor Wijgerna-Brandtson, the Dutch Communist Party is more aligned and vigorous.
    The strengthening of the unity of the international communist ranks is not only manifested in their unanimous endorsement of the Moscow Declaration, but also in their participation in the battle to criticize modern revisionism. Before the Moscow Meeting, the Communist parties of all countries repelled successive anti-communist waves manufactured by imperialism and reactionaries of all countries in a period before and after the Hungarian incident. Afterwards, when the Yugoslav modern revisionists frantically attacked the international communist movement, the Communist parties of all countries unanimously condemned and opposed modern revisionism in the workers' movement in Yugoslavia and other countries. These two battles have both politically and ideologically tempered the communist ranks of all countries, making them purer and stronger. Revisionist elements, like imperialism and reactionaries of all countries, are negative teachers for communists. In order to serve imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, the Yugoslav modern revisionists vainly attempted to disintegrate the rock-solid unity of the socialist camp and the international communist ranks as manifested in the Moscow Meeting, and vainly attempted to confront the ideological weapon given to the working class, working people, and progressive mankind by the Moscow Declaration. However, just as the aggressive policy and war policy of the U.S. imperialists went against their wishes, the conspiracy of the Yugoslav modern revisionists to establish a revisionist white flag within the international communist movement also went against their wishes: The Yugoslav leadership group lost its deceptive role within the international communist movement because it fully exposed its face as a traitor to the working class. In the struggle against revisionism, the Communist parties of all countries have strengthened their ideological work and fighting ability, and consolidated the unity within their own ranks and with each other.
    The life of imperialism is not long. Encouraged by the Moscow Meeting's program of striving for peace, democracy, national liberation, and socialism, the determination and foresight of the revolutionary proletariat and working people of all countries for the revolutionary cause are maturing more and more broadly. In the struggle between imperialism and reactionaries of all countries on the one hand, and the people of all countries on the other hand, between aggression and anti-aggression, and oppression and anti-oppression, the imperialists and reactionaries of all countries will always make trouble, fail, make trouble again, and fail again, until their final demise, and they will never violate this logic; the people of all countries will also always struggle, fail, struggle again, and fail again, until their final victory, and this is the logic of history. In history, new forces always grow from small to large and eventually gain a dominant position; decadent forces always shrink from large to small and eventually go to their demise. In the process of historical development, the expression of decadent forces as a backward movement towards death is absolute, and their expression as some forward movement of doing evil is temporary and therefore relative. Conversely, the expression of new forces as a forward movement of growth and strength is absolute, and their expression as some backward movement of setbacks and failures is temporary and therefore relative. Some forward movement of decadent forces and some backward movement of new forces are merely a twist in historical development. This twist is often unavoidable. Through this twist, the forward movement of decadent forces hides its greater backward movement, while the backward movement of new forces is preparing for its greater forward movement. The recent road taken by the ruling classes of France and some other countries to military dictatorship is such a historical twist. In these countries, the reactionary ruling classes are only temporarily succeeding, and their implementation of military dictatorship only declares the bankruptcy of bourgeois democracy, and the military dictatorship used to replace bourgeois democracy will inevitably lead to the complete failure of the reactionaries. After this kind of incident, in addition to receiving positive education from the communists, the people of these countries have military dictatorship as a negative teacher. The people of these countries will be tempered and educated, will draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, and will increasingly embark on the road of revolutionization.
    The common laws of the communist movement summarized in the great Moscow Declaration have continued to develop Marxism-Leninism and enriched the theoretical treasure house of communism. The facts of the past year prove that it is precisely because the Communist parties of all countries have mastered this theoretical weapon that the international communist movement is full of vigor and the communist ranks are strongly united. It is also because the Communist parties of all countries have mastered this theoretical weapon that they are able to unite and launch a struggle to expose and criticize modern revisionism. The reason why the theory of Marxism-Leninism is invincible is that it originates from revolutionary practice, serves revolutionary practice, and is constantly enriched and developed in revolutionary practice, so it can reflect and guide the ever-changing new historical practice, and can be universally applicable.
    The Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' parties of all countries has begun a new stage of greater prosperity in the international communist movement, marking a great turning point in the world political situation of the East wind prevailing over the West wind. Peace and socialism must continue to achieve new victories.

### 国际共产主义运动的新阶段——世界各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议和宣言一周年

    国际共产主义运动的新阶段
    ——世界各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议和宣言一周年
    去年11月，当世界各国共产党和工人党的代表聚集莫斯科，庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，在苏联共产党的创议下，在14日至16日举行了十二个社会主义国家的共产党和工人党的代表会议，在16日至19日举行了六十四个共产党和工人党的代表会议。这两个具有伟大历史意义的会议，通过了两个具有伟大历史意义的宣言。现在，莫斯科会议和莫斯科宣言已经过去一周年了。十二个社会主义国家共产党和工人党宣言，由于它总结了一百年来特别是近四十年来国际共产主义运动的经验，由于它后来又受到资本主义国家共产党的赞同，实际上成为今后一个时期内国际共产主义运动的纲领。六十四个共产党和工人党的和平宣言，由于它反映了世界人民保卫和平的坚强意志，成为引导世界人民团结一致制止战争、维护和平的号角。经过这一年，人们更加清楚地看到了：世界各国共产党和工人党自从共产国际解散以来的这一次最广泛的国际会议，由于它奠定了国际共产主义运动的团结的新的思想和政治的基础，确实开始了国际共产主义运动的新阶段。
    这一年，社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营一荣一枯的对照特别鲜明。不管帝国主义者和现代修正主义者怎样鼓吹资本主义可以逃避危机，严重的周期性经济危机的骇浪又一次席卷了主要的资本主义国家。不管帝国主义者和现代修正主义者怎样讥笑社会主义国家的计划经济和人民干劲，整个社会主义阵营充满着欣欣向荣和高速度发展的景象。今年上半年和去年同期比较，美国工业总产量下降10.8％，而苏联工业总产量上升10.5％。英国工业生产在经过三年的停滞以后继续下降，而我国工业生产扶摇直上。今年上半年和去年同期比较，社会主义阵营的工业生产平均增长了13％，而美、英、法、西德、日本五个国家平均下降了4.6％。社会主义国家的工业产量在全世界工业总产量中所占的比重，已经由去年的33％左右提高到今年的38％—40％。今年苏中两国农业都有巨大的跃进：苏联粮食空前大丰收，中国粮棉创造了增产一倍的史无前例的奇迹。至于科学技术方面，苏联已经超过而且将继续超过美国。苏联第三个巨大的人造地球卫星——名副其实的宇宙自动化科学试验室——仍在太空运转。它今年第二次发射的一级地球物理火箭，达到四百五十公里高空后准确地回到了指定的地点。美国对此只能望“空”兴叹。这些景象说明：在和平竞赛中，社会主义阵营肯定要比垮帝国主义阵营。
    这一年，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营为捍卫世界和平和支持民族独立运动而进行的斗争，取得了巨大的胜利。帝国主义集团特别是美帝国主义的侵略扩张政策和“战争边缘”政策则遭到沉重的打击。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动有了空前的发展，正使昔日帝国主义的“采邑”变成它们脚下一座座火山。帝国主义侵略势力在东方的两个地区——西亚地区和台湾海峡地区的处境，更加暴露出它们的野心很大而力量不足的致命弱点。伊拉克民族革命的胜利，打断了帝国主义在西亚的锁链。美英帝国主义对伊拉克共和国的干涉阴谋和颠覆活动，已一再宣告失败，而无可奈何。张牙舞爪地扑进黎巴嫩和约旦的美英军队，不得不夹着尾巴滚出去了。美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区所进行的军事威胁和战争挑衅，不仅未能吓住中国人民，恰好从反面起了动员中国人民的作用，并使它自己在政治上和道义上陷于空前的孤立。一年来的斗争形势表明：美帝国主义到处推行侵略政策和战争政策，其唯一的结果是到处给自己套上绞索而不得脱身，在世界人民的威力面前暴露出外强中干的纸老虎原形，成为教育全世界人民的天字第一号反面教员。
    莫斯科宣言指出：各国共产党和工人党内部的团结，它们之间的团结，社会主义国家的团结，是一切更广泛的团结的核心。只有加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和以苏联共产党为首的国际共产主义运动的团结，才能很好地团结全体劳动人民和进步人类，团结全世界爱好自由和和平的力量。自从莫斯科会议以来，各国共产党和工人党的团结，社会主义国家的团结，不论在为和平、为社会主义、为马克思列宁主义的共同事业而斗争方面，在密切往来、互相了解和交流经验方面，都有了显著的进展。
    社会主义国家的共产党和政府的领导人员在这一年中进行了广泛的访问、会谈和会议。今年5月，在莫斯科举行了经济互助委员会成员国共产党和工人党代表会议，研究了扩大社会主义国家之间经济方面的互助合作问题。6月，欧洲十五国共产党和工人党代表在柏林举行了会议，讨论了共同反对帝国主义战争政策、争取欧洲集体安全和世界和平等问题。8月，共产党和工人党的理论性和报道性月刊“和平和社会主义问题”创刊。8月，毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志在北京举行了会谈，这次会谈和所发表的会谈公报对于帝国主义侵略势力是一个严重的打击，对于世界各国爱好和平和社会进步事业的人民是一个新的巨大的鼓舞。
    此外，今年2月，周恩来同志率领的中国政府代表团访问了朝鲜；3月，斯托伊卡同志率领的罗马尼亚政府代表团访问了中国、朝鲜、越南、蒙古；4月，赫鲁晓夫同志率领的苏联党政代表团访问了匈牙利，伏罗希洛夫同志访问了波兰；5月，哥穆尔卡同志率领的波兰党政代表团访问了保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚；7月，诺沃提尼同志率领的捷克斯洛伐克党政代表团访问了苏联；10月，哥穆尔卡同志率领的波兰党政代表团访问了苏联。
    各国共产党和工人党在这一年中都以不懈的工作，使国际共产主义运动的潮流更加壮阔。苏联共产党在领导苏联人民进行共产主义建设方面取得了伟大的成就，在联合世界上一切爱好和平的力量打散战争乌云方面作出了卓越的贡献。现代修正主义者的反苏的毁谤，丝毫也不能损害作为国际共产主义运动团结中心的伟大的苏联共产党，相反，它在世界劳动人民中的威信更加增高了。苏联共产党正在积极筹备召开的第二十一次代表大会，和在这次大会上将要通过的鼓舞人心的1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济计划指标，将是苏联加快共产主义建设的一个重要里程碑。中国共产党领导中国人民通过整风运动和反右派斗争，胜利地进行了政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命。在今年5月间举行的中共八届二次会议上制订了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。在这条总路线的照耀之下，全国掀起一个共产主义思想大解放、工农业生产大跃进、人民公社化和全民皆兵运动大发展、教育与劳动生产相结合的高潮。其他社会主义国家的人民，在各国共产党的领导下，也在经济、政治、文化各方面取得了巨大的成就。今年蒙古人民革命党、保加利亚共产党、捷克斯洛伐克共产党和德国统一社会党先后举行了代表大会，这些大会都成为团结和动员这些国家的人民加快建设社会主义的发动机。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的共产党，日益成为各国民族独立斗争中全民族团结的核心。主要的资本主义国家的共产党在反对反动派的进攻和反对修正主义分子的破坏的艰苦斗争中，增强了团结和斗志。法国共产党正在团结和教育本国人民反对戴高乐的独裁统治，进行捍卫法国的共和制度。意大利共产党在今年5月大选中取得了辉煌的胜利。芬兰共产党及其盟友也在国会选举中取得了第一大党的地位。日本共产党正在团结日本人民展开一个声势浩大的反对岸信介政府追随美国侵略政策、复活日本军国主义的运动，为争取日本的独立、民主、和平而斗争。美国共产党在清除了盖茨等修正主义分子之后重新获得了战斗力。丹麦共产党在批判了拉森修正主义集团和开除拉森出党之后，荷兰共产党在清除了叛徒魏吉纳—布兰德森之后，队伍更加整齐了，力量更加充沛了。
    国际共产主义队伍的团结的加强，不仅表现在它们一致赞同莫斯科宣言上面，而且表现在它们一起投入批判现代修正主义的战斗上面。在莫斯科会议以前，世界各国共产党在匈牙利事件前后的一个时期中击退了帝国主义和各国反动派所制造的接二连三的反共浪潮。以后，当南斯拉夫现代修正主义疯狂地向国际共产主义运动进攻的时候，世界各国共产党一致谴责和反对南斯拉夫和其他国家的工人运动中的现代修正主义。这两次战斗都在政治上思想上锻炼了各国共产主义队伍，使它们更加纯洁，更加坚强。修正主义分子和帝国主义、各国反动派一样，是共产党人的反面教员。南斯拉夫现代修正主义者为了替帝国主义特别是美帝国主义效劳，妄想瓦解社会主义阵营和国际共产主义队伍在莫斯科会议上所表现的磐石般的团结，妄想对抗莫斯科宣言所给予工人阶级、劳动人民和进步人类的思想武器。但是，正如美帝国主义者的侵略政策和战争政策走向它的愿望的反面一样，南斯拉夫现代修正主义者要在国际共产主义运动内部树立修正主义白旗的阴谋也走到了它的愿望的反面：南斯拉夫领导集团由于完全暴露了工人阶级叛徒的面目而失去在国际共产主义运动内部进行欺骗的作用。世界各国共产党在反修正主义的斗争中加强了自己的思想工作和战斗能力，巩固了自己队伍内部和彼此之间的团结。
    帝国主义的寿命已经不长了。由于受到莫斯科会议争取和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义的纲领的鼓舞，世界各国革命无产阶级和劳动人民对于革命事业的坚定性和预见性正在日益广阔地成熟起来。在帝国主义和各国反动派作为一方，各国人民作为一方之间的侵略和反侵略、压迫和反压迫的斗争中，帝国主义和各国反动派一方总是捣乱、失败、再捣乱、再失败，直到最后灭亡，他们决不会违背这个逻辑；各国人民一方也总是斗争、失败，再斗争、再失败，直到最后胜利，这是历史的逻辑。在历史上，新生力量总是由小变大，最后取得支配的地位；腐朽力量总是由大变小，最后归于灭亡的命运。在历史的发展过程中，腐朽力量之表现为走向死亡的后退运动是绝对的，它们表现为逞凶作恶的某些前进运动则是暂时的，因而也就是相对的。相反地，新生力量之表现为成长壮大的前进运动是绝对的，它们表现为挫折和失利的某些后退运动则是暂时的，因而也就是相对的。腐朽力量的某些前进运动和新生力量的某些后退运动，不过是历史发展的一个曲折。这种曲折往往是不可避免的。通过这个曲折，腐朽力量的前进运动埋伏着它的更大的后退，而新生力量的某些后退运动却是准备着它的更大的前进。最近法国和其他一些国家的统治阶级走上军事独裁的道路，就是这样一种历史的曲折。在这些国家里，反动统治阶级不过是暂时得逞，它们实行军事独裁只不过宣告了资产阶级民主的破产，而用来代替资产阶级民主的军事独裁必将引出反动派的彻底失败。经过这种事变，这些国家的人民除了受到共产党人的正面教育之外，又有军事独裁来当反面教员。这些国家的人民就会受到锻炼和教育，就会划清敌我的界限，就会日益走上革命化的道路。
    伟大的莫斯科宣言所总结的共产主义运动的共同规律，继续向前发展了马克思列宁主义，丰富了共产主义的理论宝库。一年来的事实证明，正是由于世界各国共产党掌握了这一理论武装，才出现了国际共产主义运动的蓬勃生气和共产主义队伍的坚强团结。也正是因为各国共产党都掌握了这一理论武装，所以才能够团结一致地展开揭露和批判现代修正主义的斗争。马克思列宁主义的理论之所以是无敌的，就在于它是来源于革命实践，为革命实践服务，并且在革命实践中不断地得到丰富和发展，因而它就能够反映和指导不断变更的新的历史实践，并且能够放之四海而皆准。
    世界各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议开始了国际共产主义运动更加兴盛的新阶段，标志着东风压倒西风的世界政治形势的伟大转折点。和平和社会主义一定要继续取得新的胜利。
