Respected Comrade Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet, Respected Comrades of the Korean Government Delegation, the Korean Military Delegation, and the Korean Art Troupe, Comrades, Friends:

Today, people from all walks of life in our capital gather here to welcome Comrade Kim Il-sung, the close friend of the Chinese people and the beloved leader of the Korean people, to welcome all the comrades of the Korean Government Delegation, to welcome all the comrades of the Korean Military Delegation and the Korean Art Troupe. We feel very honored and happy. Please allow me, on behalf of the people of the capital and the entire Chinese people, to express our highest respect to our distinguished guests, to our fraternal Korean people.

Our capital's people have just welcomed the Chinese People's Volunteers returning from Korea. They brought back to the motherland the unparalleled deep friendship of the Korean government and the Korean people towards the Chinese people. The vigorous support and meticulous care given to the Chinese People's Volunteers by the Korean Workers' Party, the government, and the entire people of Korea, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, during the eight years in Korea, will be forever etched in our memories. During the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, the Korean government and the Korean people gave them such warm and cordial send-offs. For this, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the Korean government and the Korean people.

The Victory of the Korean People Strongly Supported Our Country's Construction

We, the Chinese people, have boundless and profound feelings for the heroic Korean people. The great victory of the Korean people in resisting American aggression not only defended their own motherland, but also severely struck at the American aggressors' plot to attack the Chinese mainland from the two flanks of Taiwan and Korea and launch a world war, powerfully supported our peaceful construction in China, and greatly inspired the determination and confidence in victory of all oppressed countries and peoples in the world to resist American aggression. The victory of the Korean people is the victory of the Chinese people, the victory of the entire socialist camp, and at the same time, the victory of all peace-loving countries and people in the world!

Our two countries, China and Korea, share weal and woe. The Chinese people will never forget that in the extremely difficult years of our revolutionary cause, Comrade Kim Il-sung and many other Korean comrades fought side by side with us against Japanese imperialism. After World War II, the revolutionary struggles of our two countries successively achieved victory, and we established close and friendly cooperative relations. The joint combat of the outstanding sons and daughters of China and Korea on the Korean battlefield has more firmly solidified the great friendship between our two peoples. This friendship was established and developed in the long-term revolutionary struggle against common enemies, is based on the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism, and is eternally unbreakable. Its power is invincible.

We are Advancing Side by Side on the Socialist Road

For more than five years, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have healed the wounds of war and have increased Korea's industrial and agricultural production beyond the highest pre-war levels. Now, the Korean people are striving to successfully complete the First Five-Year Plan. Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the Korean people are "riding the Chollima" and displaying a spirit of selfless labor on the road to building socialism, constantly achieving new victories on various fronts. Korea's industrial and agricultural production this year has greatly improved compared to last year. The Korean people have already achieved the agricultural production tasks of the First Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year and are working hard to complete the industrial production tasks of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. These great achievements made by the Korean people in peaceful construction make all the Chinese people feel very happy. Just like in the war against American aggressors, we regard every achievement of the Korean people in peaceful construction as our own achievement. We believe that the diligent and brave Korean people, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, will surely achieve even greater and more brilliant victories!

Comrades, friends! Our Chinese people, under the guidance of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" put forward by the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are leaping forward on all fronts of socialist construction and have already achieved tremendous achievements. This year, our country's annual grain output may double compared to last year. The annual steel output may also double. With the great leap forward in agricultural production and the improvement of the political consciousness of 500 million peasants, our country's rural areas have basically realized communization. These achievements are the result of the hard work of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party; at the same time, it is inseparable from the advanced experience and generous assistance of the Soviet Union, and inseparable from the support and assistance of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union. We deeply know that our work still has many shortcomings, we still lack experience in socialist construction, and we still have many difficulties to overcome. We sincerely hope that Comrade Kim Il-sung and other Korean comrades will give us criticism and correction for the shortcomings in our work.

America's Retrogressive Actions Will Only Accelerate Its Own Demise

Our two peoples are vigorously carrying out socialist construction, but we have not forgotten for a moment the American imperialists' aggression and threat to our two countries. American imperialism not only occupies the southern part of Korea, but also occupies China's territory of Taiwan. They deliberately obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, and they try to create "two Chinas" in order to turn South Korea and Taiwan into permanent American colonies and military bases. American imperialism was and still is the most dangerous common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people. The Chinese people resolutely support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland and firmly believe that the Korean people's struggle will surely be victorious. American imperialism can neither prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, nor can it prevent the three thousand miles of Korea from being unified. The era when American imperialism could arbitrarily run rampant in the East has passed. Its retrogressive actions will only accelerate its own demise.

Comrades, friends, all the Chinese people and the people of the world can see clearly from the victorious struggle of the Korean people that American imperialism is a paper tiger that appears strong on the outside but is weak on the inside. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago that the current era is one in which the East wind prevails over the West wind, that imperialism and all reactionary and decadent forces are bound to perish, and that the new forces of socialism and national revolution are bound to be victorious, and that the new forces must defeat the decadent forces. Ironclad facts have proven and will continue to prove that this is the truth. Now, the Korean people are advancing victoriously, the Chinese people are advancing victoriously, the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union is advancing victoriously, the national revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing, and the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace is continuing to rise. In our new world, everything is full of vigor, and everything is developing prosperously. And the old world of imperialism has fallen into an increasingly serious economic and political crisis, and the capitalist system is heading towards death at an unexpected speed. No force in the world can save it from extinction. We represent the trend of historical development, we represent the direction of human progress, we represent light, we represent peace. We firmly believe that light will surely defeat darkness, progress will surely defeat reaction, peace will surely defeat war, and final victory must belong to us!

Long live the heroic Korean people!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!

Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

Long live world peace! (The main title and subheadings were added by the editors of this newspaper)

    中国人民对朝鲜人民的感情深厚
　  坚决支持朝鲜为统一祖国的斗争
    彭真同志在首都人民欢迎朝鲜政府代表团大会上的讲话敬爱的金日成首相同志，敬爱的朝鲜政府代表团、朝鲜军事代表团和朝鲜艺术团的全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们首都各界人民在这里集会，欢迎中国人民的亲密朋友和朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成同志，欢迎朝鲜政府代表团的全体同志们，欢迎朝鲜军事代表团和朝鲜艺术团的全体同志们，我们感到非常荣幸和高兴。请允许我以首都人民和全中国人民的名义，向我们的贵宾们，向兄弟的朝鲜人民，表示崇高的敬意。
    我们首都人民，刚刚欢迎了从朝鲜归来的中国人民志愿军。他们把朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民对中国人民无比深厚的友谊带回祖国。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的八年中，以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党、政府和全体人民对他们的大力支援和无微不至的关怀，使我们永远感念不忘。在中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的过程中，朝鲜政府、朝鲜人民又那样热烈亲切的欢送。对此，我们谨向朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民表示衷心的感谢。
    朝鲜人民的胜利有力支援了我国建设
    我们中国人民对英雄的朝鲜人民，有着无限深厚的感情。朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略的伟大胜利，不但保卫了自己的祖国，而且严重地打击了美国侵略者企图从台湾和朝鲜两个侧翼进攻中国大陆、发动世界战争的阴谋，有力地支援了我们中国的和平建设，极大地鼓舞了全世界一切被压迫的国家和人民反抗美国侵略斗争的决心和胜利信心。朝鲜人民的胜利，就是中国人民的胜利，就是整个社会主义阵营的胜利，同时，也是全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的胜利！
    我们中朝两国是休戚与共的。中国人民永远不会忘记，在我国革命事业极其艰难的岁月里，金日成同志和其他许多朝鲜同志，就同我们在一起并肩作战，反对日本帝国主义。第二次世界大战以后，我们两国的革命斗争先后取得了胜利，我们两国建立了亲密友好的合作关系。朝鲜战场上中朝两国优秀儿女的共同作战把我们两国人民的伟大友谊更加牢固地凝结在一起。这种友谊是在长期的反对共同敌人的革命斗争中建立和发展起来的，是以马列主义的共同思想为基础的，是永恒的牢不可破的。它的力量是不可战胜的。
    我们在社会主义道路上并肩前进
    五年多以来，朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜政府领导下，医治了战争创伤，并且使朝鲜的工农业生产量超过了战前最高指标。现在，朝鲜人民正在为胜利完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。朝鲜人民在劳动党的领导下，正在“跨上千里马”在建设社会主义的道路上发挥忘我劳动精神，不断在各个战线上取得新的胜利。朝鲜的工农业生产今年比去年有了很大的提高。朝鲜人民今年已经提前三年实现了第一个五年计划的农业生产任务，并且正在为提前完成第一个五年计划的工业生产任务而努力。朝鲜人民在和平建设中所取得的这些巨大成就，使全中国人民感到十分高兴。如同在反对美国侵略者的战争中一样，我们把朝鲜人民在和平建设中的每一项成就，看成是自己的成就。我们相信勤劳勇敢的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党的正确领导下，一定会取得更加伟大、更加辉煌的胜利！
    同志们，朋友们！我们中国人民，正在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党提出的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的引导下，在社会主义建设的各个战线上向前跃进，已经取得了巨大的成绩。今年我国的粮食年产量可能比去年翻一番。钢的年产量也可能翻一番。随着农业生产的大跃进和五亿农民政治觉悟的提高，我国农村已经基本上实现了公社化。这些成就是我国人民在中国共产党领导下艰苦奋斗的结果；同时，它是同苏联的先进经验和慷慨援助分不开的，是同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的支持和援助分不开的。我们深知道，我们的工作还是有不少缺点的，我们还缺乏社会主义建设的经验，在我们面前还有不少困难需要克服。我们热诚地希望金日成同志和其他朝鲜同志们，对于我们工作中的缺点给予批评和指正。
    美国的倒行逆施只会加速自己的死亡
    我们两国人民都在轰轰烈烈地进行着社会主义建设，但是我们一刻也没有忘记美帝国主义对我们两国的侵略和威胁。美帝国主义不仅盘踞着朝鲜南部，而且还在霸占着中国的领土台湾。他们蓄意阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，他们力图制造“两个中国”，以便于把南朝鲜和台湾变成美国永久的殖民地和军事基地。美帝国主义过去是、现在仍然是中朝人民共同的最危险的敌人。中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民和平统一自己祖国的斗争，并且深信朝鲜人民的斗争是一定要胜利的。美帝国主义既不能阻挠中国人民解放台、澎、金、马，也决不能阻挠朝鲜的三千里江山归于统一。美帝国主义在东方可以任意横行霸道的时代已经过去了。它的倒行逆施只会加速自己的死亡。
    同志们，朋友们，全中国人民和全世界人民都可以从朝鲜人民的胜利斗争中看清楚，美帝国主义是一个外强中干的纸老虎。毛泽东同志早就指出，现在是东风压倒西风的时代，帝国主义和一切反动的腐朽力量是一定要死亡的，社会主义和民族革命的新生力量是一定要胜利的，新生的力量一定要战胜腐朽的力量。铁的事实已经证明，并且还会继续证明这是真理。现在，朝鲜人民在胜利前进，中国人民在胜利前进，以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国都在胜利前进，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族革命运动正在蓬勃发展，世界人民保卫和平的斗争正在继续高涨，在我们的新世界，一切都充满着朝气，一切都在欣欣向荣地发展。而帝国主义的旧世界，却陷入了日益严重的经济危机和政治危机，资本主义制度正在以人们意想不到的速度走向死亡，世界上没有任何力量可以挽救它的灭亡。我们代表着历史发展的潮流，我们代表着人类进步的方向，代表着光明、代表着和平。我们深信光明必将战胜黑暗，进步必将战胜反动，和平必将战胜战争，最后胜利一定属于我们！
    英雄的朝鲜人民万岁！
    中朝两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！　（大题和小题都是本报编者加的）
