Xinhua News Agency, 28th: In many ethnic minority regions across the country, a widespread trend of learning the Han language (both spoken and written) has taken shape in government offices, factories, schools, and people's communes.

    With the development of socialist ethnic relations in our country and the great leap forward in production and construction, the connections between various ethnic groups have become increasingly close. People of ethnic minorities increasingly feel that merely developing their own ethnic languages and scripts is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the technological and cultural revolutions. In order to facilitate the learning of advanced experiences from the Han people and to further enhance economic and cultural exchanges between ethnic groups, the vast number of ethnic minority cadres and masses are urgently requesting to learn the nationally used Han language. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, more than 80% of Mongolian cadres in urban and rural areas have learned the Han language, which makes it much easier for them to understand and implement the policies and guidelines of the Party and the state than in the past. Many Evenki cadres and hunters living in the primeval forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains are now able to read Han newspapers, which has broadened their horizons. In the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, a large number of Korean cadres have also learned the Han language. Now, meetings can be held without interpreters, and they can directly read Han books and newspapers. In the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, all ethnic minority cadres have learned the local Han dialect, and most of them can understand Mandarin. Therefore, they no longer feel constrained by language difficulties in their daily work and lives. In the entire autonomous prefecture, more than 240,000 young and middle-aged people have already learned more than 1,500 commonly used Han characters. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, ethnic minority workers, cadres, and students, in addition to making friends with Han people and learning languages from each other through joint labor and life, also organize Han language learning groups or establish regular Han language learning systems. After the Yao Autonomous County of Dayao Mountain in Guangxi launched a movement to learn the Han language, cadres of all ethnic groups throughout the county, from production team leaders to county-level government offices, have learned to speak Mandarin, and more than 91% of young and middle-aged people have initially learned to recognize Han characters.

    According to the urgent demands of the people, ethnic minority primary schools in areas such as Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, while teaching in their own ethnic languages, also have Han language courses. Ethnic minority primary schools in Guizhou and Hainan Island have adopted Han textbooks and use a combination of ethnic languages and Mandarin to conduct classes. In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, more than 130,000 primary school students of Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Dong, and other ethnic groups have launched a movement to learn Mandarin.

    适应技术革命和文化革命的需要
    少数民族热情学习汉族语文
    新华社28日讯　全国许多少数民族地区的机关、工厂、学校和人民公社中，已广泛形成学习汉文汉语的风气。
    随着我国社会主义民族关系的发展和生产建设的大跃进，各民族间的联系已经越来越密切，少数民族人民日益感到仅仅发展本民族的语言文字，已经不能适应技术革命、文化革命的需要。为了便于学习汉族的先进经验，进一步增进民族之间经济、文化的交流，广大少数民族干部和群众迫切要求学习全国通用的汉文汉语。在内蒙古自治区的城市和农村，有80％以上的蒙古族干部学会了汉文汉语，因而在领会、执行党和国家的政策方针上，比过去有很大的方便。居住在大兴安岭原始森林中的许多鄂伦春族干部和猎民，现在已能看懂汉文报纸，眼界更加开阔。延边朝鲜族自治州也有大批朝鲜族干部学会汉文汉语，现在开会可以不再用翻译，并且能够直接阅读汉文书报。海南黎族苗族自治州所有少数民族干部都学会了当地的汉语，绝大部分还能听懂普通话，因此他们在日常工作和生活中已不再感到受语言限制的困难。全自治州还有二十四万多名青壮年，现在已经学会一千五百多个常用汉字。新疆维吾尔自治区的少数民族工人、干部、学生们，除了和汉族在共同劳动和生活中交朋友，互相学习语文以外，还组织汉文学习小组或建立定期学习汉文的制度。广西大瑶山瑶族自治县开展学习汉文汉语运动后，全县从生产队长到县级机关的各族干部，都已学会讲普通话，91％以上的青壮年都已初步认得了汉字。
    根据人民群众的迫切要求，内蒙古、青海以及延边朝鲜族自治州等地区的民族小学，在用本民族语文教学的同时，还设有汉族语文课程。贵州和海南岛的民族小学，都采用了汉文课本，以民族语言和汉语普通话相结合进行讲课。在广西僮族自治区，已有十三万多名僮、瑶、苗、侗等族小学生，展开了学习普通话的运动。
