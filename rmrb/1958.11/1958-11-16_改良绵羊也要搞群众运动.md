Improving mutton sheep in China began in 1950. In recent years, thanks to the attention and strong support of party and government leaders in various regions, the work of improving mutton sheep has expanded to all sheep-raising provinces and autonomous regions across the country. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of June 1958, the country already had 2.84 million improved sheep, accounting for 6.7% of the total number of mutton sheep. Xinjiang has the most improved sheep, with 1.24 million, accounting for 10.3% of the region's total number of mutton sheep. Gansu Province has 257,000 improved sheep, accounting for 8.9% of the province's total number of mutton sheep. In areas where improvement work started earlier, a number of villages and communes that are completely improved with good breeds have already emerged. It is estimated that in 1958, the country can produce 11.7 million *jin* of improved fine wool and semi-fine wool, fundamentally changing the historical situation in which China could not produce fine wool and semi-fine wool. This is the beginning of a great victory.

Improving mutton sheep, transforming China's existing mutton sheep with low wool yield and coarse wool quality into fine-wool sheep with high wool yield and fine wool quality, is one of the important contents of China's livestock industry's technological revolution. In recent years, practical work has proven that improving mutton sheep is a great thing. It is of great significance for increasing people's income, increasing wool production, and supplying raw materials for the wool textile industry. At present, China's mutton sheep produce only about two *jin* of wool per year, while first-generation improved sheep can generally produce four *jin* of wool per year, more than double that of unimproved sheep. Second-generation improved sheep can produce five to six *jin* of wool, an increase of about two times. In terms of wool fineness, China's unimproved wool cannot be used to weave woolen fabrics and other products, while the fineness of wool from second-generation and above improved sheep can generally reach 60 counts, basically meeting the requirements of the wool textile industry.

In 1958, under the new situation of the all-round Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural construction, China's work of improving mutton sheep has also entered a new period of rapid development. The number of improved mutton sheep mating heads in various regions has reached 6 million, more than one and a half times the total number of improved mating heads in the entire year of 1957, equivalent to the sum of the total number of improved mating heads in the past six years. However, the improvement work in 1958 has not ended, and the enthusiasm in various regions is soaring, and the improvement work is developing rapidly. It can be fully predicted that this year China's work of improving mutton sheep will achieve an unprecedented and great achievement.

However, the scale and speed of China's work of improving mutton sheep are far from meeting the needs of the comprehensive development of national economic construction. At present, a particularly prominent problem is that China's wool production cannot meet the needs of raw materials for the wool textile industry. A large part of the raw materials for the wool textile industry are still imported from abroad. In 1956 alone, the imported wool tops were equivalent to more than 35,000 tons of raw wool. It is understood that since the Great Leap Forward, the equipment utilization rate and production capacity of the wool textile industry have doubled. The raw materials that used to last for a year are now used up in half a year. The current slow growth of wool production is far from meeting the needs of the Great Leap Forward in China's wool textile industry.

Under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people are accelerating the construction of socialism and creating a rich material foundation for an early transition to communism. In order to achieve this happy and beautiful goal as soon as possible, we must produce large quantities of grain, oil, cotton cloth, and meat, but increasing wool production and producing large quantities of wool textiles is also an aspect that cannot be ignored. At present, our consumption level in this area is very low. In 1957, China's total wool production was only about 50,000 tons, with an average of only one *jin* of wool for every six people in the country. We must catch up quickly and catch up with and surpass the advanced levels in the world as soon as possible.

More than 60% of China's mutton sheep are concentrated in the four major pastoral areas of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Gansu. Mutton sheep are the most economically lucrative livestock among all livestock in the pastoral areas, and their numbers also account for the absolute majority of all livestock. Therefore, from an economic income perspective, improving mutton sheep at high speed, increasing wool production, and improving quality is also a very important and strategic measure for building pastoral areas.

We must go all out and aim high, pushing the work of improving mutton sheep from one climax to another, and strive to basically improve China's mutton sheep into fine-wool sheep and semi-fine-wool sheep with high wool yield and excellent wool quality in the shortest possible time.

Is it possible to achieve such a requirement? We believe it is entirely possible. China has a nine-year history of improving mutton sheep, and the masses have an urgent need, which lays the foundation for us to improve mutton sheep at high speed.

The realization of cooperation in pastoral areas and the development of people's communes have created favorable conditions for carrying out the work of improving mutton sheep at high speed. This makes it possible to rely on organized farmers (herdsmen) to carry out improvement work, and to change the previous method of having the state send cadres, buy stud rams, and establish artificial insemination stations to improve mutton sheep for the masses. This method of carrying out mass movements and following the mass line to improve mutton sheep began to appear after the development of the agricultural cooperation movement in 1955, and has developed year by year. It is expected that this year the number of commune-run mutton sheep artificial insemination stations nationwide will increase to more than 16,000, and the number of artificial insemination technicians will reach more than 25,000, which can basically ensure that there are artificial insemination stations in every village and commune in areas with mutton sheep.

There are four major benefits to doing this: First, technology is decentralized, and improving mutton sheep flourishes everywhere; second, everyone participates, accelerating the speed of improvement; third, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and the work takes root among the masses, making it easier to do well; fourth, saving manpower and material resources, and the cost is low. In a word, it can be done more, faster, better, and more economically. However, some people disagree with this approach. They mystify the improvement of mutton sheep, do not believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, and believe that farmers (herdsmen) who have not attended school cannot master artificial insemination technology. This is a conservative and superstitious idea that should be greatly criticized.

Supplying enough fine-wool stud sheep is a material condition for massively improving mutton sheep. Thanks to the selfless assistance of the Soviet government and the efforts of Chinese scientists, we have established a large fine-wool stud sheep herd. China now has 14 large stud sheep farms, with more than 200,000 fine-wool stud sheep, which can basically meet our needs. The current problem is that the utilization rate of stud sheep is not high. At present, our general stud sheep mating number is only about 200 heads, but the high ones reach more than 1,000 heads, and this year there have been many high-yield records of mating 4,000 to 5,000 heads. According to statistics, there are now more than 50,000 adult stud rams used for improvement. If the utilization rate can be greatly improved and the technical level of artificial insemination can be improved, the speed of China's improvement of mutton sheep will definitely be greatly accelerated.

    改良绵羊也要搞群众运动
    农业部畜牧兽医局副局长　陈凌风
    我国改良绵羊是由1950年开始的。几年来由于各地党政领导的重视和大力支持，目前改良绵羊的工作已经扩展到全国所有养绵羊的省和自治区。据不完全统计，1958年6月底全国已经有改良羊二百八十四万只，占绵羊总数的6.7％。其中改良羊最多的是新疆，有改良羊一百二十四万只，占该区绵羊总头数的10.3％。甘肃省有改良羊二十五万七千只，占该省绵羊总头数的8.9％。在改良工作开展早的地区，目前已经出现了一批全部良种化的乡和社。预计1958年全国可生产改良的细羊毛和半细羊毛一千一百七十万市斤，根本上改变了历史上我国不能生产细羊毛和半细羊毛的局面，这是一个伟大胜利的开端。
    改良绵羊，把我国现有产毛量低和毛质粗劣的绵羊变成为产毛量高和毛质纤细的细毛羊，是我国畜牧业技术革命的重要内容之一。几年来，实际工作证明了改良绵羊是一件大好的事情，对于增加人民收入，增加羊毛产量，供应毛纺工业原料均具有十分重要的意义。目前，我国的绵羊每只年产羊毛只有二市斤左右，而经过改良的一代绵羊，一般年产毛可达到四市斤，比没有改良的羊增加一倍以上。改良的二代绵羊，产毛量则可达到五、六市斤，约增加二倍。在羊毛细度方面，我国未经改良的羊毛，不能纺织毛呢等产品，而二代以上的改良羊毛细度一般可以达到六十支纱，基本上合乎毛纺工业的要求。
    1958年在工农业建设全面大跃进的新形势下，我国改良绵羊的工作，也进入了一个飞跃发展的新时期。各地改良绵羊配种头数已经达到六百万只，超过1957年全年改良配种总头数的一倍半以上，相当于过去六年改良配种总头数的总和。但是，1958年的改良工作并未结束，各地的干劲冲天，改良工作正在急速发展。完全可以预计，今年我国改良绵羊的工作必将取得一个史无前例的伟大成绩。
    但是，我国改良绵羊工作的规模和速度还远远不能适应国民经济建设全面大发展的需要。当前，特别突出的问题是我国羊毛产量不能满足毛纺织工业原料的需要，毛纺织工业原料中很大一部分仍然由国外进口，单1956年进口的毛条就折合原毛三万五千多吨。据了解，大跃进以来，毛纺织工业的设备利用率和生产能力增长了一倍，原来一年的原料，现在半年就用光了。现在羊毛产量增长缓慢的情况，已经远远不能适应我国毛纺织工业大跃进的需要。
    我国人民在党的领导下正在加速建设社会主义，创造丰富的物质基础，早日过渡到共产主义。为了早日达到这个幸福美好的目标，我们要生产大量的粮食、油料、棉布、肉类，但是增产羊毛，生产大量的毛纺品，也是一个不可忽视的方面。目前我们在这方面消费的水平很低，1957年我国羊毛总产量只有五万吨左右，全国平均每六个人才有一市斤羊毛。我们必须急起直追，及早地赶上和超过世界的先进水平。
    我国绵羊的60％以上集中在新疆、内蒙古、青海、甘肃等四大牧区，而绵羊又是牧业区各种牲畜中经济收入最多的一种牲畜，它的数量也占各种牲畜的绝对多数。因此，从经济收入上看，高速度地改良绵羊，增加羊毛产量，提高质量，也是建设牧业区的一项非常重要的、具有战略意义的措施。
    我们必须鼓足干劲、力争上游，把改良绵羊的工作由一个高潮推向另一个高潮，争取在最短的时间内把我国绵羊基本上改良成产毛量高的毛质优良的细毛羊和半细毛羊。
    实现这样的要求有没有可能呢？我们认为是完全可能的。我国改良绵羊已有九年的历史，群众有迫切的要求，这就给我们打下了高速度地改良绵羊的基础。
    牧业区合作化的实现，人民公社的发展，给高速度进行改良绵羊工作创造了一个有利的条件。这就有可能依靠组织起来的农（牧）民进行改良工作，而改变已往由国家出干部、买种公羊、建立人工授精站给群众改良绵羊的方法。这种搞群众运动，走群众路线来改良绵羊的方法，在1955年农业合作化运动发展起来以后，即已开始出现，并且逐年发展。预计今年全国社办的绵羊人工授精站将发展到一万六千多处，人工授精技术员将达到二万五千多人，可以基本上作到有绵羊的地区，乡乡、社社都有人工授精站。
    这样作有四大好处：第一，技术下放，改良绵羊遍地开花；第二，大家动手，加快了改良速度；第三，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，工作在群众中扎根，容易做得好；第四，节省人力、物力，成本低廉。一句话，可以多、快、好、省。但是有些人是不同意这条方针的，他们把改良绵羊神秘化，不相信群众的智慧和力量，认为没有上过学堂的农（牧）民不能掌握人工授精技术，这是一种应该大加批判的保守思想和迷信思想。
    供应足够的细毛种羊是大量改良绵羊的一个物质条件。由于苏联政府的无私援助，我国科学工作者的努力，我们已经建立起了一个庞大的细毛种羊群，我国现在已拥有十四处大型种羊场，有二十多万只细毛种羊，已经基本上可以满足我们的需要。目前的问题是种羊利用率不高，现在我们一般种羊配种头数只有二百头左右，但高的则达到一千头以上，今年出现了不少配四千到五千只的高产纪录。据统计，现在改良用的成年种公羊有五万多只，如果都能大大提高利用率，提高人工授精的技术水平，我国的改良绵羊速度一定会大大加快。
