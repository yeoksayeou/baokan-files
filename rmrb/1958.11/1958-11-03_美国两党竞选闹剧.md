    U.S. Two-Party Election Farce
    Zhang Zhenya

    On November 4th, the United States will hold congressional and gubernatorial elections. For the past two months, the Republican and Democratic parties have been fully engaged in an election battle, with their leading figures Eisenhower, Nixon, Truman, Stevenson, Humphrey, ... all throwing themselves into this war of words.

        No Platform
    The Republican and Democratic parties' election campaign has been a chaotic farce from the start. In this election battle, neither party has presented voters with any clear platform; all they have offered are mutual abuse, personal attacks, and confused and contradictory cries.

    To cater to the people's anti-war sentiment, both the Democratic and Republican parties hypocritically compete to present themselves as "peace-makers," while labeling the other side as the "war party."

    The Democratic Party's firepower is mainly concentrated on the Republican Party's unpopular foreign policy and the economic crisis. Truman, Stevenson, Acheson, Senators Green, Mansfield, Morse... almost all unanimously condemned the Republican government for leading the American people towards a terrible nuclear war. In a speech in Milwaukee, Stevenson openly attacked the Eisenhower administration for "harming America's prestige and peace" on the issue of small islands "of no use to the Formosa government (Chiang Kai-shek group)." Stevenson and other Democrats have targeted Nixon as their target of attack; Stevenson called Nixon an "intolerable demagogue." The Democratic National Committee also published a campaign pamphlet, "Democratic Facts," to accuse the Eisenhower administration of causing the United States to "fall into the most severe recession since World War II at home and face the deadly danger of war and failure everywhere abroad" in less than six years in power.

    The Republican government, which came to power in the 1952 and 1956 elections under the banner of "peace and prosperity," hurriedly shouted that the policy on the Taiwan area should not be a "topic for open debate" in the election campaign in order to get rid of its passive situation and tried its best to play a "reconciliation" posture on the issue of aggression against China. Then, it fiercely attacked Truman's past performance in power to prove that the Democratic Party was no better than the Republican Party. Some senior Republicans even came up with a fanciful "brilliant plan": try to portray the Democratic Party as a "socialist party"! ? And they clamored that if the Democratic Party came to power, it would "nationalize the property of big capital"! ? According to "New York Times" reporter Raskin, the wonderful use of this strategy lies in the fact that it is a smokescreen that "can make voters forget the recession, high prices, heavy taxes, the horror of war, Adams' corruption, and Eisenhower's golf game."

    The Republican Party's Misfortune
    Although Eisenhower and Nixon went out together to campaign for the Republican Party, judging from the results of the recent preliminary nomination elections in various cities and villages in the United States, the Republican Party's prospects are very bad. According to an Associated Press survey report, after the Democratic Party won a great victory in Maine in September, winning the state's governor seat, a senator seat, and two of the three congressmen, the Democratic Party is currently more advantageous than the Republican Party in more than a dozen states such as Arizona, California, Connecticut, Indiana... Other American newspapers and public opinion polls have also predicted that the Republican Party will suffer the biggest defeat since 1936.

      Party Infighting
    In this unfavorable situation, the Republican Party's internal strife has also surfaced. The extreme right-wing elements in the Republican Party, represented by Knowland, Nixon, and former Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Strauss, took advantage of the failure in Maine to take the opportunity to use strong pressure to force Eisenhower to dismiss his special assistant Sherman Adams. Adams' forced resignation, like the forced resignation of other conservatives in the Republican Party such as former Undersecretary of State Hoover Jr., former Treasury Secretary Humphrey, and former Defense Secretary Wilson, marked the strengthening of the extreme right-wing's control over the government.

    However, Adams' resignation did not ease the contradictions within the Republican Party. On the contrary, the right wing and conservatives in the party were strongly dissatisfied with Eisenhower's weak leadership in domestic and foreign affairs. The right wing complained that Eisenhower was indecisive on the Jinmen and Matsu issues and was too "accommodating" to labor; the isolationists among the conservatives believed that he had always been led by the nose by the right wing and vacillated in various policies. This division has reached such a serious degree that the conservatives have adopted a fatalistic and indifferent attitude in this election, and even threatened not to donate campaign funds; while Nixon openly scolded the conservatives: "I don't think there is anything more shameful than running away from the fight when the environment is unfavorable!"

      California's Internal Strife
    The Republican Party's internal strife not only appeared in Washington, but also expanded in California. The notorious Republican right-wing leader Knowland, in order to achieve his personal political ambition of becoming the President of the United States, even rudely forced Knight, a Republican who was already confident of winning the governorship of the state, to withdraw from the election, and let him be the gubernatorial candidate. However, Knight refused to publicly support Knowland. This puts the Republican Party in danger of suffering a complete defeat in California, that is, losing both the governor and the senator. On October 20, Eisenhower went to Los Angeles to "mediate," but Knight still announced at a press conference the next day: I do not support Knowland's election as governor.

    The Oil Tycoon's "Victory"
    For the Republican Party, the only thing that is certain is probably the New York gubernatorial election. Representing the Republican Party here is Nelson Rockefeller, a descendant of the oil dynasty.

    But here, rather than saying that Nelson Rockefeller is running in the name of the Republican Party, it is better to say that he is using the prestige of his family to overwhelm his opponent, the Democratic incumbent governor Harriman. After the Republican Party in New York announced Rockefeller's candidacy for governor, many newspapers that had always claimed to support the Democratic Party, such as the "New York Post," suddenly changed their tone and supported Rockefeller. Even the "New York Times," a mouthpiece of monopoly capital that claims to be "non-partisan," has become Rockefeller's campaign platform. On October 16, the newspaper published a rare long editorial praising the descendant of the oil dynasty in a nauseating manner, calling him "new blood" in American political life and possessing "the character and broad experience in business, management, and government work" to be governor. But interestingly, in this article of more than 2,000 words of praise, it did not mention the Republican Party he represents. No wonder, after reports in various newspapers that Eisenhower and Nixon would go to New York to "help" Rockefeller campaign, the Associated Press said: If he (Rockefeller) wins, the part that relies on himself is probably about the same as or even more than the part that relies on Eisenhower and Nixon. That is to say, the reputation of the President and Vice President combined is not as resounding as a name in the Rockefeller family.

    In any case, even without the appearance of representatives of big monopoly capital to run for election, this congressional and gubernatorial election is just a farce played on the henchmen of the monopoly capital group. If there is anything worth noting, it is that the bankruptcy of bourgeois politics, the deepening of the economic crisis, and the repeated setbacks in the foreign policy of aggression cannot but be reflected to a certain extent.

    美国两党竞选闹剧
    张振亚
    11月4日，美国将要举行国会选举和州长选举。两个月来美国共和、民主两党全力展开了竞选斗争，它们的头面人物艾森豪威尔、尼克松、杜鲁门、史蒂文森、汉弗来，……都投入了这场唇枪舌战之中。
        没有政纲
    共和、民主两党的竞选自始就是一场混乱的丑剧。在这场竞选斗争中，两党都没有向选民提出任何鲜明的政纲，有的不过是相互谩骂、人身攻击以及混乱和自相矛盾的叫嚷罢了。
    为了迎合人民的厌战心理，民主党和共和党都假惺惺地竞相以“和平缔造者”自居，并把“战争党”的帽子扣在对方的头上。
    民主党的火力主要集中在共和党的失尽人心的外交政策和经济危机问题上。杜鲁门、史蒂文森、艾奇逊，参议员格林、曼斯菲尔德、莫尔斯……几乎是异口同声地谴责了共和党政府正在把美国人民引向一场可怕的核战争。史蒂文森在密尔基窝发表的演说中，公开攻击艾森豪威尔政府在“对福摩萨政府（蒋介石集团）毫无用处”的小岛问题上“危害美国的威望和和平。”史蒂文森和其他民主党人都把尼克松作为他们攻击的目标；史蒂文森把尼克松称作是一个“不能容忍的煽动政客”。民主党全国委员会还出版了一本竞选小册子“民主实况”，来指责艾森豪威尔政府在不到六年的执政时间内就使美国“在国内陷于第二次世界大战以来最厉害的衰退中，在国外遭到战争的致命危险和到处失败”。
    在1952年和1956年两次竞选中都是打着“和平和繁荣”的招牌上台的共和党政府，为了摆脱挨打的被动处境，赶忙叫嚷台湾地区的政策不宜作竞选运动中“公开辩论的题目”，并竭力在侵略中国的问题上玩弄“和解”姿态，然后，就猛攻杜鲁门当年执政时的劣绩，证明民主党并不比共和党高明。共和党的一些高级人士，还抬出了一条异想天开的“锦囊妙计”：竭力把民主党说成是一个“社会主义政党”！？并扬言民主党上台就会“把大资本的财产国有化”！？据“纽约时报”记者拉斯金透露，原来这条计策的妙用在于它是一个障眼法，“能使选民们忘掉衰退、高昂的物价、沉重的赋税、战争的可怕、亚当斯的贪污和艾森豪威尔的高尔夫球戏。”
    共和党的厄运
    尽管艾森豪威尔和尼克松一齐出动，为共和党的竞选奔走，但是从最近美国各个城市和乡村初步提名选举的结果看来，共和党的前景是十分不妙的。据美联社的调查报告，继9月份民主党在缅因州大获胜利赢得了该州州长席位、一个参议员席位和三个众议员中的两个席位之后，目前民主党在亚利桑那、加利福尼亚、康涅狄格、印第安纳……等十几个州又比共和党占优势。”其他一些美国报纸和民意测验所也纷纷预测，共和党将遭到1936年以来的最大惨败。
      党内的倾轧
    在这种不利的处境中，共和党内的内哄也表面化了。以诺兰、尼克松和前原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯为代表的共和党内的极右翼分子，借缅因州的失败为由，乘机以强大的压力迫使艾森豪威尔辞退了他的特别助理薛尔曼·亚当斯。亚当斯的被迫辞职正像以前共和党内其他保守派如前副国务卿小胡佛、前财政部长汉弗来和前国防部长威尔逊的被迫告退一样，标志了共和党内极右翼对政府控制的加强。
    但是亚当斯的辞职并没有能缓和共和党内部的矛盾。恰正相反，这个党内的右翼和保守派都对艾森豪威尔内政外交领导的软弱无力发生了强烈的不满。右翼抱怨艾森豪威尔在金门、马祖问题上虎头蛇尾，对劳工过于“迁就”；保守派的孤立主义分子则认为他一直是被右翼牵着鼻子走，在各项政策上摇摆不定。这一分歧已达到如此严重程度，以致在这次竞选中保守派分子竟采取了听天由命的冷漠态度，甚至以不捐助竞选经费相威胁；而尼克松则公开责骂保守派道：“我认为再没有什么比环境不顺利时就逃避斗争更为可耻！”
      加州的内哄
    共和党的内哄不仅在华盛顿出现，而且在加利福尼亚州扩大开来。臭名远扬的共和党右翼领袖诺兰，为了达到他做美国总统的个人政治野心，竟蛮横地强迫在竞选这个州州长席位方面已有获胜把握的共和党人奈特退出竞选，而由他任州长候选人。但是奈特拒绝公开支持诺兰。这使共和党面临在加利福尼亚州遭受全盘败北，即既失掉州长，又失掉参议员的危险。10月20日艾森豪威尔到洛杉矶进行“调解”，但奈特第二天在记者招待会上仍然宣布：我不支持诺兰当选州长。石油大王的“胜利”
    对于共和党说来，唯一有把握的，恐怕只有纽约州长的竞选了。在这里代表共和党的是石油王朝的后代纳尔逊·洛克菲勒。
    但是这里与其说纳尔逊·洛克菲勒是以共和党的名义在竞选，倒不如说他是以他的家族的声威来压垮他的对手民主党的现任州长哈里曼。在纽约州的共和党宣布了洛克菲勒竞选州长以后，许多一向自称是支持民主党的报纸像“纽约邮报”等也突然改变声调，支持起洛克菲勒来了。甚至像“纽约时报”这家自称是“超党派”的垄断资本喉舌竟也成了洛克菲勒的竞选讲台。10月16日这家报纸以罕有的长篇社论对这位石油王朝的后裔作了一番肉麻的吹捧，称他是美国政治生活中的“新血液”，具有做州长的“品格和在商业、管理和政府工作三方面的广阔经验”。但是有趣的是在这篇长达两千字的歌功颂德的文章中，却对他所代表的共和党未置一词。难怪在各报传出艾森豪威尔和尼克松将到纽约州“帮助”洛克菲勒进行竞选以后，美联社却说：如果他（洛克菲勒）胜利的话，这里面靠他自己的成分同靠艾森豪威尔、尼克松的成分大概差不多，甚至还比后者更多一点。也就是说，堂堂总统和副总统的声望加起来，还抵不上洛克菲勒家族中的一个名字响亮。
    本来嘛，即使没有大垄断资本的代表人物出场竞选，这场国会和州长的选举，都不过是玩弄在垄断资本集团股肱之上的闹剧。如果有值得注意的地方，那就是资产阶级政治的破产、经济危机的深刻化，对外侵略政策的连遭挫败，不能不在一定程度上反映出来。
