Xinhua News Agency, November 28th, London Dispatch: The British government held a cabinet meeting on the same day (27th) it received the Soviet Union's note proposing to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city to discuss the matter. It is revealed that Britain has begun consultations with several countries, including West Germany.

The British government has not formally expressed its attitude toward the Soviet proposal. However, sources say that senior British officials said that the Soviet proposal was "unacceptable." They absurdly used the fact that the German Democratic Republic had not been established when the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France signed the agreement on the occupation of Berlin as an excuse, stubbornly insisting that the Soviet Union could not return its administrative power over Berlin to the German Democratic Republic, but "should" hand it over to the United States, Britain, and France.

These officials' remarks indicate that they still intend to entangle the Berlin issue with the long-unresolved German reunification issue due to Western obstruction.

On the other hand, these officials privately expressed their willingness to use the six-month period provided by the Soviet Union to "consider" the future of Berlin.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 28th: The French government held a meeting on the 27th to discuss the Soviet government's note on the Berlin issue. Information Minister Soustelle told the press after the cabinet meeting that the Soviet government's note on the Berlin issue "creates a situation that needs to be studied very carefully." He said that the French government is "paying very close attention to this issue and will closely monitor the development of the situation in this regard."

According to people close to de Gaulle, French officials will not immediately express their attitude towards the Soviet proposal. Agence France-Presse quoted authoritative sources as saying, "The Soviet note raises extremely important issues, and the French government will discuss it with its allies."

    英国举行内阁会议进行讨论  法官方表示要仔细研究形势
    新华社28日讯　伦敦消息：英国政府在接到苏联建议把西柏林变成非军事的自由城市的照会的当天（27日），就举行内阁会议，来讨论这个问题。据透露，英国已经开始同包括西德在内的一些国家进行磋商。
    英国政府没有正式表示它对苏联建议的态度。但是，有消息说，英国的高级官员说，苏联的建议是“不能接受的”。他们荒谬地以所谓苏、美、英、法四国在签订关于占领柏林问题的协定时德意志民主共和国还没有成立为借口，硬说苏联不能把它对柏林的管理权交还给民主德国，而“应当”交给美、英、法三国。
    这些官员的谈话表示，他们还打算把柏林问题同由于西方的阻挠而长期未能解决的德国重新统一问题纠缠在一起。
    另一方面，这些官员又私下表示愿意利用苏联所提供的六个月的期限来“考虑”柏林的前途问题。
    新华社巴黎28日电　法国政府在27日开会讨论了苏联政府关于柏林问题的照会。情报部长苏斯戴尔在内阁会议后向报界说，苏联政府关于柏林问题的照会“造成了一个需要非常仔细研究的形势”。他说，法国政府“非常注意这个问题，并且将密切注意这方面事态的发展”。
    据接近戴高乐的人士说，法国官方不会马上对苏联的建议表示态度。法新社引用权威人士的话说，“苏联的照会提出了极为重要的问题，法国政府将同自己的盟国讨论它。”
