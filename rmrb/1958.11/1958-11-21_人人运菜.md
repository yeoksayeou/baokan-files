　　Everyone Transports Vegetables
　　The Nanan District Vegetable Company in Chongqing fully relies on the masses to transport vegetables. They make full use of the high pedestrian traffic on the Huangjueya to Longmenhao transportation route, doing some publicity and mobilization work. First, they pack fresh vegetables (sweet potatoes, pumpkins, loofahs, eggplants, etc.) into small baskets, bags, and sacks, weighing ten or twenty catties each, and entrust cadres, students, soldiers, and farmers passing through Longmenhao to transport the fresh vegetables from Huangjueya to the Longmenhao market reception station. From 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM on October 14th and for two and a half hours each on the 15th and 16th, one hundred and sixteen pedestrians carried more than two thousand catties of fresh vegetables, solving the transportation difficulties. This method of relying on the masses for transportation is being promoted.

    人人运菜
    重庆市南岸区蔬菜公司充分依靠群众运菜。他们利用黄桷垭至龙门浩这条交通要道来往行人很多的特点，作些宣传动员工作，先把鲜菜（红苕、南瓜、丝瓜、茄子之类）用小篮子、兜兜、口袋装成十斤、二十斤不等，委托要路过龙门浩的机关干部、学生、军人、农民把鲜菜从黄桷垭运到龙门浩市场接待站去。10月14日下午三点到七点和15、16日各二个半小时的时间，有一百一十六个行人携带了两千多斤鲜菜，解决了运输上的困难，这一依靠群众运输的方法正在推广。
