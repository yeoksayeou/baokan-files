Henan and Hunan Local Teams and Brigades Run Factories to Mass Produce Native Fertilizer
    Preparing More "Fine Grain" for Crops

    (Our dispatch) Zhengzhou – On the basis of the victorious conclusion of the wheat sowing task, Henan Province is launching a mass movement of self-reliance, prioritizing native methods over foreign ones, to vigorously produce native fertilizer. This will provide wheat fields with sufficient high-quality fertilizer, promote robust wheat growth, and ensure a larger bumper harvest next year.

    Henan Province is planting 80 million mu of wheat this year, with the goal of increasing the yield per unit area from the original 270-odd jin to over 1,000 jin next year. One of the key factors in achieving this magnificent leap forward target is fertilizer. However, the current national supply of chemical fertilizer falls far short of demand. While composting coarse fertilizer is an option, it cannot be used urgently at present, and its large volume makes transportation and application difficult. Under these circumstances, various localities, through open discussions and debates, have universally implemented the policy of using native methods to manufacture chemical fertilizer. In order to strengthen leadership in the production of native fertilizer, Xuchang Prefecture has established fertilizer offices from the prefecture to the county level, designated more than 3,700 cadres to focus on fertilizer, organized visits for learning and comparison, and trained 160,000 native fertilizer technicians. After debate, cadres and the masses in Xinxiang Prefecture realized the importance of native fertilizer for increasing production. The entire prefecture, led by the secretary, mobilized the entire Party and the entire population to engage in a large-scale native fertilizer industry. After 25 days of hard work, fertilizer plants were established in every township and brigade, with smoke rising from fertilizer cellars everywhere. As of early November, more than 100,000 native chemical fertilizer plants and bacterial fertilizer plants have been built throughout the province. In October alone, more than 300 types of fertilizers were produced, including potassium chloride, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, calcium carbide, haloid fertilizer, urea, manure concentrate fertilizer, ammonium sulfate and quick-acting fertilizer, totaling more than 400,000 tons, as well as 230 million jin of various bacterial fertilizers. Some of these fertilizers have already been applied to the fields, while others are stored in fertilizer depots of various production units as topdressing fertilizer.

    The raw materials used in various places to manufacture native fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer are mostly local products. The manufacturing method is simple, the cost is low, and the quality of the finished products is generally very good. Ammonium sulfate extracted from sulfur mine slag in Bo'ai County contains 17.4% nitrogen. In the first half of this year, according to the results of native fertilizer demonstrations conducted on eight crops in 56 counties throughout the province, whether it was cotton, tobacco, sesame, peanuts, or food crops such as rice and corn, the increase in production was very significant wherever native fertilizer was used. At the same time, because native fertilizer has high fertilizer efficiency (100 jin of native fertilizer can be equivalent to 10,000 jin of coarse manure), it can also save a large amount of labor for transporting fertilizer.

    (Our dispatch) Changsha – Qianyang Prefecture in Hunan Province is adopting the methods of "small, native, and mass" to launch a mass movement of building kilns and furnaces on every mountain and running factories in every team, vigorously producing phosphate and potash fertilizer, and preparing large quantities of native fertilizer for next year's great leap forward in agriculture.

    Qianyang Prefecture is a mountainous area with continuous mountains and few people but abundant land. Rice accounts for 80% of the total cultivated land in the district. In the past, the masses paid little attention to rational fertilization. Rice production mainly relied on nitrogen fertilizers such as cutting green grass on the mountains, turf, pond mud, and ditch manure, neglecting the production and application of phosphate and potash fertilizers. Although the district achieved a yield of 1,000 jin per mu this year, due to excessive nitrogen fertilizer and lack of phosphate and potash fertilizers, the potential for increasing rice production has not been fully tapped. Lodging, weak grains, and empty shells were more common in high-yielding fields.

    In order to strive for a greater bumper harvest of rice next year, the Qianyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, while focusing on deep plowing, water conservancy, and manure accumulation, particularly emphasized the production of phosphate and potash fertilizers. Under the instructions of the Prefectural Committee, the Party committees of all twelve counties and cities in the district established special offices led by the Party secretary in charge of agriculture. Adopting the principle of "small, native, and mass," 10,195 various fertilizer plants were built and put into production one after another within a month, including 5,826 phosphate and potash fertilizer plants; a professional army of more than 50,000 people was trained to manufacture native fertilizer; and more than 946 million jin of various native fertilizers were produced, including more than 516 million jin of phosphate and potash fertilizers.

    In the beginning, they did not understand the method of manufacturing native fertilizer, so various localities sent a group of cadres to other places to learn experience and technology. When some cadres learned the manufacturing method and succeeded in local experiments, the movement was fully launched. The Qianyang County Party Committee first personally led a key project in the Xima Commune. After a month of hard work, phosphate and potash fertilizers were successfully trial-produced, and a live meeting of the secretaries of all communes in the county was immediately held to impart technology. Within a week, more than 1,740 factories were built throughout the county, producing more than 4 million dan of various native fertilizers. In the movement to vigorously produce native fertilizers, the counties not only learned from the experience of other places, but also proposed the slogan of "everyone using their brains, everyone contributing ideas," giving full play to the wisdom of the masses and creating many new methods of native fertilizer production.

    While vigorously promoting the native method of manufacturing phosphate and potash fertilizer, various localities adopted the method of making the best of local conditions, making full use of resources, manufacturing locally, and using locally, relying on the masses to run native fertilizer plants in every team. The Jinhe Commune in Mayang County, relying on the masses, raised 640 large pots for boiling native fertilizer, more than 700 loads of buckets and baskets, more than 500 drying mats, as well as lime, plant ash, etc., and established 280 native fertilizer plants in five days. The Xima Commune in Qianyang County, relying on the masses, modified small blast furnaces for iron smelting to smelt phosphate fertilizer, and used stone rollers from workshops and oil presses to replace ore crushers, and successively established 400 fertilizer plants.

    While the "small, native, and mass" fertilizer production movement has fully developed, many counties and people's communes have also tried to run large factories. Huitong County and the masses have built ten small blast furnaces to smelt molten phosphate fertilizer using phosphate rock, with a daily output of 20 tons. Many small and medium-sized fertilizer plants originally run by communes are gradually expanding and developing into regular factories. (Zhang Shengbin)

    河南湖南各地队队办工厂大造土化肥
    为农作物多多准备“细粮”
    本报讯　在麦播任务胜利结束的基础上，河南省正掀起一个群众性的，自力更生、先土后洋的大搞土化肥运动，从而给麦田准备足够的优质肥料，促进麦子生长健旺，保证明年的更大丰产。
    河南省今年种植小麦八千万亩，要求明年单位面积产量由原来的二百七十多斤，提高到一千斤以上。实现这个宏伟的跃进指标，重要关键之一是肥料。但是，目前国家供应化肥远远不能满足需要，沤制粗肥一则眼下不能急用，二则量大运输和追施有困难。在这种情况下，各地通过鸣放辩论，普遍贯彻执行了运用土法制造化学肥料的方针。许昌地区为了加强土化肥生产的领导，从专区到县都成立了肥料办公室，指定干部三千七百多人专抓肥料，组织参观评比，并训练制造土化肥技术员十六万人。新乡专区经过辩论，干部和群众认识到土化肥对增产的重要意义之后，全区以书记挂帅，全党动员，全民出征，大搞土化肥工业，经过苦战二十五天，乡乡社社都建起化肥厂、队队肥窖冒起狼烟。截至11月初，全省建起土制化肥厂、细菌肥料厂十万多个。仅10月份，生产出氯化钾、硫酸铵、硝酸铵、碳化钙、卤膏化肥、尿素、粪精化肥、硫酸錏和速效肥料等三百多种，计四十多万吨，各种细菌肥料二亿三千万斤。这些肥料，目前有的已施入田间，有的作为追肥保存在各个生产单位的肥库。
    各地制造土化肥和细菌肥料所用的原料，绝大部分都是当地的土产品。它的制法简便，成本低，制造出来的成品，一般质量很好。博爱县从硫磺矿渣中提制的硫酸铵含氮17.4％。今年上半年，根据全省在五十六个县八种作物上进行的土化肥示范结果，不论是棉花、烟叶、芝麻、花生和水稻、玉米等粮食作物，凡使用土化肥的增产都很显著，同时由于土化肥肥效高（土化肥每百斤能顶粗粪肥一万斤），并可节省大量运肥的劳动力。

    本报讯　湖南省黔阳专区采取小、土、群的方法，掀起一个山山建炉窑，队队办工厂，大造磷钾肥的群众运动，为明年农业大跃进准备大批土化肥。
    黔阳专区是个群山连绵，人少田多的山区。全区水稻占总耕地面积的80％，过去群众很不讲究合理施肥，水稻生产主要依靠刈青（山上青草）、草皮，塘泥，凼粪等氮肥，忽视磷、钾肥料的生产和应用。今年虽然获得稻谷每亩产一千斤专区，但是由于氮肥过多，磷、钾肥料缺乏，还没有充分挖掘稻谷增产的潜力。一般高产田较普遍地出现倒伏，谷粒不壮实，空壳多等现象。
    为了争取明年稻谷更大丰收，中共黔阳地委在大抓深耕、水利、积肥的同时，特别重视磷、钾肥料的生产。在地委指示下，全区十二个县、市的党委都成立专门的办公室，由专管农业的党委书记亲自领导，采取“小、土、群”的方针，在一月内，先后建成投入生产的各种化肥厂一万零一百九十五个，其中磷、钾肥厂五千八百二十六个；培训了一支五万多人制造土化肥的专业大军；生产各种土化肥九亿四千六百多万斤，其中磷、钾肥五亿一千六百多万斤。
    开始，不懂制造土化肥的方法，各地就派出了一批干部到外地学习经验技术，当一部分干部学会制造方法，并在本地试验成功后，运动就全面展开。黔阳县委首先在洗马公社亲自领导一个重点，经过一月苦战，试制成功磷、钾肥料，立即召开全县各公社书记现场会，传授技术，一星期内全县建厂一千七百四十多个，生产各种土化肥四百余万担。各县在大造土化肥的运动中，不仅学习外地经验，还提出“人人动脑筋，个个献计策”的口号，发挥群众的智慧，创造了许多新的土制化肥的方法。
    在大力推广土法制造磷钾肥的同时，各地采取因陋就简，充分利用资源，就地取材，就地制造，就地使用的办法，依靠群众，队队办土化肥厂。麻阳县锦和公社依靠群众，自筹熬煎土化肥的大锅六百四十口，水桶、箩筐七百多担，晒簟五百多床以及石灰、草木灰等，五天内就创办了二百八十个土化肥厂。黔阳县洗马公社依靠群众，改装炼铁小土炉冶炼磷肥，利用作坊、榨坊的石碾，代替碎矿机，先后办起四百个化肥厂。
    在“小、土、群”大造化肥运动的全面发展的同时，许多县和人民公社也试办了大型工厂，会同县群众兴建小高炉十个，用磷矿石冶炼融溶磷肥，日产二十吨。原有社办的许多中小化肥厂，正逐步扩大向正规化工厂发展。　　（张胜斌）
