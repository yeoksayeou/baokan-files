    Sanmenxia Dam Cutoff Project

    Comb Teeth: Usually, when constructing hydraulic structures on rivers, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the project and allow the river water to continue flowing normally, it is necessary to solve the problem of construction diversion, so that the project can be carried out on dry land. Generally, construction diversion methods include using channels, tunnels, or aqueducts for diversion, staged diversion, and the comb teeth method, etc. The comb teeth method is often used to build concrete dams, where the dam body is shaped like a comb, with water flowing through the bottom between each tooth, and then using gates to gradually raise the concrete. Sanmenxia used a staged diversion method, with the first stage involving the construction of the bottom concrete works of the left bank overflow section, shaped like comb teeth, covered with cover plates to form twelve bottom holes. During the second stage of the project, river water flowed through the bottom holes of the comb teeth.

    Cofferdam: A cofferdam is a temporary water-retaining structure used to protect the construction pit of hydraulic engineering structures. Before construction, a cofferdam is often built, and the accumulated water in the foundation pit is pumped out (if there is water), so that work can be carried out in the foundation pit. Commonly used cofferdams include: earth cofferdams, riprap cofferdams, log crib cofferdams, sheet pile cofferdams, cellular cofferdams, concrete cofferdams, etc.

    Advancing Method: The method of gradually advancing and filling from the river bank towards the river center when building earth dikes (or stone dikes) and carrying out cutoff is called the advancing method. It can be advanced from one bank or simultaneously from both banks, finally converging.

    Partition Wall: In general embankment-type hydropower stations, a partition wall is often built between the hydropower station and the spillway dam to separate the downstream water flow of the spillway dam and the hydropower station, so as to prevent the high-speed water flow from the spillway dam during flood discharge from affecting the tailwater flow of the hydropower station and thus affecting the work of the water turbine. The partition wall of the Sanmenxia water conservancy project also serves as a longitudinal cofferdam during the construction period.

    Pier: There is a pier between the left overflow section and the right power station section of the Sanmenxia water conservancy project. It is actually part of the dam body, but it is used as a longitudinal cofferdam during the construction period and is connected to the partition wall. (Huang Tingji)

    三门峡截流工程
    梳齿：通常在河流上建造水利工程建筑物时，为了要保证工程的顺利进行而又能使河水照常地流过，就要解决施工导流的问题，使工程能在干地上进行。一般施工导流有利用渠道、隧洞或渡槽导流，分期导流和梳齿法等等。梳齿法常用于建造混凝土坝，是将坝体作成如梳齿的形状，在梳齿各齿间底处过水，然后利用闸门轮流加高混凝土。三门峡是用的分期导流办法，第一期先作左岸溢流部底部混凝土工程，作成梳齿状，盖上盖板，即形成十二个底孔，第二期工程进行时，河水经梳齿底孔流过。
    围堰：围堰是用来围护水利工程建筑物施工基坑的临时性挡水建筑物。在施工以前，往往先修筑围堰，抽去基坑中的积水（如有水时），即可在基坑中进行工作。经常采用的围堰有：土围堰、堆石围堰、木笼围堰、板桩围堰、格形围堰、混凝土围堰等等。
    进占法：在堆筑土堤（或石堤）和进行截流时，由河岸向河心方向逐步推进填筑的方法，叫进占法。可以由一岸进占，也可以两岸同时进占，最后合龙。
    隔墙：一般的堤坝式水电站，在水电站和溢流坝之间常常修筑一道隔墙，用以分开溢流坝和水电站下游的水流，以免溢流坝泄洪时的高速水流影响水电站的尾水水流进而影响水轮机的工作。三门峡水利枢纽的隔墙，同时又用作为施工时期的纵向围堰。
    隔墩：三门峡水利枢纽在左边溢流部和右边电站部之间有一段隔墩，它实际上是坝体的一部分，但在施工期间利用作为纵向围堰，与隔墙相连。　　　（黄庭济）
