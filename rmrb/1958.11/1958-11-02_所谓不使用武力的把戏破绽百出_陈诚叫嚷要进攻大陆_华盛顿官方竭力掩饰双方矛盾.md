Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch – At a luncheon on the 31st to “celebrate” Chiang Kai-shek’s seventy-second birthday, Chen Cheng, the “vice president” of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, delivered a speech clamoring that returning to the mainland remains the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "primary mission and goal," and even threatened that if the Chinese people started to liberate Jinmen and Mazu, the Chiang Kai-shek clique would launch an offensive against the mainland. Chen Cheng said: "Talking about us not counterattacking is a lie."

United Press International, in reporting on Chen Cheng's speech, pointed out that since the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek meeting communique stated that the Chiang Kai-shek clique would "not use force to attack the mainland," "Taipei officials have always said that the government (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek clique) does not completely abandon the use of military force to realize the 'sacred mission' of returning to the mainland."

After Chen Cheng made these remarks, U.S. State Department spokesman White issued a statement in Washington that same day denying that there were differences between the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek on the issue of "not using force." Although, according to UPI, Washington "officials admit that talks like Chen Cheng's have the effect in the public's mind of making it seem that it partially violates the no-use-of-force statement issued by Chiang Kai-shek and Dulles on October 23."

White reiterated the U.S. stance, saying that the U.S. State Department believes that Chen Cheng's remarks "do not indicate a violation of the policy announced by the Republic of China (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek clique): that the main means of achieving the government's mission of restoring the freedom of citizens on the mainland will be peaceful." He then added: "This of course does not preclude the use of force for self-defense or in the event of a large-scale uprising on the mainland (i.e., the Hungarian-style counter-revolutionary riot dreamed of by Dulles). As we understand it, it means that the Republic of China (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek clique) itself will not launch a war to re-establish its power on the mainland." White also reiterated that the understanding reached between Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Foreign Minister" Yeh Kung-chao in 1955 remains valid, the gist of which is: unless approved by the Americans, the Chiang Kai-shek clique cannot use force against the mainland.

### 所谓不使用武力的把戏破绽百出  陈诚叫嚷要进攻大陆  华盛顿官方竭力掩饰双方矛盾

    所谓不使用武力的把戏破绽百出
    陈诚叫嚷要进攻大陆
    华盛顿官方竭力掩饰双方矛盾
    新华社1日讯　蒋介石集团的“副总统”陈诚31日在“庆祝”蒋介石七十二岁生日的午宴上发表演说，叫嚷回到大陆仍然是蒋介石集团的“首要使命和目标”，并且扬言如果中国人民着手解放金门马祖，蒋介石集团就要对大陆发动进攻。陈诚说：“谈论我们将不进行反击，那是骗人的。”
    合众国际社在报道陈诚演说的消息中指出，自从杜勒斯蒋介石会谈公报表示蒋介石集团将“不使用武力进攻大陆”以后，“台北官员们一直说政府（即蒋介石集团）并不完全放弃使用军事力量来实现回到大陆的‘神圣使命’”。
    在陈诚说了这番话以后，美国国务院发言人怀特当天就在华盛顿发表谈话否认美蒋之间在“不使用武力”问题上有分歧。虽然据合众国际社消息说，华盛顿“官方人士承认，像陈诚的那种谈话在公众的心目中产生这样一种效果，就是使人觉得它部分地违反了蒋介石杜勒斯10月23日发表的不使用武力声明”。
    怀特重申美国的态度说，美国国务院认为，陈诚的这种谈话“并不表明违背中华民国（即蒋介石集团）所宣布的政策：实现政府恢复大陆上的公民的自由的使命的主要手段将是和平的。”他接着又说：“这当然并不排斥为了自卫或者在大陆发生大规模起义（即杜勒斯梦想的匈牙利式反革命暴乱）时使用武力。据我们了解，它意味着中华民国（即蒋介石集团）自己将不发动战争以重建它在大陆的权力。”怀特并且重申，杜勒斯在1955年同蒋介石集团“外交部长”叶公超达成的谅解仍然有效，这个谅解大意是：除非得到美国人的批准，否则蒋介石集团不能对大陆使用武力。
