    Acquisition work must guarantee both quantity and quality. It is indeed not easy to achieve both of these points when all tasks are very demanding.
    Can things that are not easy to do be left undone? No. The quality of the product is an important indicator of work performance. Only pursuing quantity without paying attention to quality may seem like completing the task on the surface, but in reality, it is not completed. Because if agricultural products that have not been dried properly are acquired, incidents such as heating up and rotting will inevitably occur, causing losses to state resources. Therefore, in any busy situation, strictly establish an acceptance system, grade and classify, store according to grade, and conduct education on patriotism and quality awareness among the broad masses, so that everyone cares about product quality, and quality will be guaranteed.
    Neijiang Special District in Sichuan Province pays special attention to quality in the acquisition of agricultural products. The 250,000 dan of cotton and 40 million jin of peanuts that have already been stored in this district all meet the quality requirements. This is a manifestation of patriotism.

    重量又重质
    收购工作，既要保证数量又要保证质量。在各项工作十分紧张的时候，要保证做到这两点，确是不容易的事。
    对于不容易做到的事是不是可以不做呢？不。质量好坏是衡量工作成绩的一个重要标志。光求数量，而不讲求质量，表面上好像完成了任务，实际上并没有完成。因为没有晒干的农产品收购进来，必然会发生发热霉烂等事故，造成国家资材的损失。所以在任何繁忙的情况下，严格建立验收制度，分等论级，分级入库，在广大群众中进行爱国主义和质量观点的教育，让大家都来关心产品质量，质量就会得到保证。
    四川内江专区在农产品收购中特别注意质量，这个区已经入库的二十五万担棉花，四千多万斤花生全部合乎质量要求，这是爱国主义的一种表现。
