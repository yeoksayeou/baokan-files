Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice on launching a universal socialist and communist education movement throughout the army.

    The notice pointed out that at present, the rural areas of the country have basically realized the people's commune system. The in-depth development of the people's commune movement will greatly accelerate socialist construction and the gradual transition to communism, and completely eliminate the remnants of private ownership of the means of production. Our army is a force led by the Party and fighting for the complete liberation of mankind. Realizing communism is our highest ideal and long-term goal. Therefore, we should carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution and make all commanders and fighters promoters of the people's commune movement and the advance towards communism.

    The notice pointed out that this education focuses on solving the following problems: (1) Eliminate private ownership concepts. Private ownership is a scourge and the root of many erroneous ideas, which must be completely eliminated. We must carry forward the communist spirit and correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective, the part and the whole, and immediate and long-term interests. (2) Eliminate bourgeois ideology, establish the attitude of serving the people wholeheartedly, and consciously establish a communist labor attitude that is obedient to social needs, has no quotas, makes no conditions, and does not consider remuneration. Actively support the implementation of the supply system.
    (3) Eliminate bourgeois privileged thinking and hierarchical concepts, and establish mass viewpoints and communist egalitarianism. Appear as ordinary workers, treat people equally, be able to work at both higher and lower levels, be able to serve in both military and civilian roles. Consciously implement the Party's instructions on cadres going down to the company to serve as soldiers and participating in physical labor, implement the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, and gradually eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor. (4) Eliminate the individual living habits of small producers and old family concepts, and cultivate communist collective living habits. Actively support women in liberating themselves from the small circle of housework and participating in social labor. (5) We must stand firm on the communist position and treat the people's commune movement with a correct attitude. The people's commune is the inevitable trend of historical development in our country, so we must actively support and endorse communization. (6) We must oppose complacency, declining fighting spirit, haggling over personal gains and losses, and living confined to the narrow circle of personal selfishness. We should have a full spirit of continuous revolution, and after passing the socialist barrier, we will pass the communist barrier. Our ideal is to realize communism throughout the world so that all mankind can live a happy and beautiful life, and we must strive unremittingly to realize this great and lofty ideal!

    The notice requires all units to concentrate a period of time at the end of this year to vigorously publicize the unprecedented great leap forward achievements of the country's industry, agriculture, culture, education, scientific research, and other construction undertakings. On the basis of summarizing the experience of the great leap forward in the construction work of our army, publicize the great achievements our army has made in the rectification movement and in the past year in military training and technical and cultural revolutions, and lay a good foundation for the new leap forward in various construction works next year. The notice finally pointed out that communist education, with the people's commune issue as its core content, is a long-term task, and all units must continuously conduct uninterrupted education for the troops according to new circumstances.

    解放军永远当促进派
    总政通知在全军开展社会主义和共产主义教育运动
    据新华社15日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部最近发出关于在全军普遍开展社会主义和共产主义教育运动的通知。
    通知指出，目前全国农村已经基本上实现了人民公社化，人民公社运动的深入发展，将大大加速社会主义建设和向共产主义逐步过渡，彻底消灭生产资料私有制残余。我军是党领导的为人类的彻底解放而奋斗的部队，实现共产主义是我们的最高理想和长期奋斗的目标。因此，应当发扬不断革命的精神，使全军指战员成为人民公社运动和向共产主义前进的促进派。
    通知指出，这次教育着重解决以下几个方面的问题：（1）破除私有观念。私有观念是一种祸害，是许多错误思想的根源，必须彻底清除。要发扬共产主义精神，正确处理个人与集体、局部与整体、眼前与长远利益的关系。（2）破除资产阶级思想，树立全心全意为人民服务，自觉地建立服从社会需要，没有定额、不讲条件、不计报酬的共产主义劳动态度。积极拥护实行供给制。
  （3）破除资产阶级的特权思想和等级观念，树立群众观点和共产主义的平等思想。以普通劳动者的姿态出现，平等待人，能上能下，能军能民。自觉地执行党的干部下连当兵和参加体力劳动的指示，贯彻执行党的教育与生产劳动结合的方针，逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。（4）破除小生产者的个体生活习惯和旧的家庭观念，培养共产主义的集体的生活习惯。积极支持妇女从家务劳动的小圈子中解放出来参加社会劳动。（5）要站稳共产主义立场，以正确的态度来对待人民公社运动。人民公社是我国历史发展的必然趋势，因此对公社化要积极拥护和支持。（6）要反对满足现状、斗志衰退、斤斤计较个人得失、生活局限于个人自私自利的狭小圈子里。我们应有饱满的不断革命精神，过了社会主义关又过共产主义关。我们的理想是要在全世界实现共产主义，使全人类都能过美好幸福的生活，并要为实现这个伟大而崇高的理想奋斗不懈！
    通知中要求各单位在今年年底集中一段时间，大张旗鼓地宣传国家工业、农业、文化教育、科学研究以及其他各项建设事业的空前大跃进的成绩，并在总结我军各项建设工作大跃进经验的基础上，宣传我军在整风运动和一年来军事训练以及技术、文化革命等各个方面所获得的巨大成绩，为明年各项建设工作走上新的跃进打下良好的基础。通知最后指出，以人民公社问题为中心内容的共产主义教育是长期的，各单位必须不断根据新的情况，对部队进行不间断的教育。
