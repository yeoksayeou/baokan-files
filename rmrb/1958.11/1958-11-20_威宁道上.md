    Past Qixingguan,
    Ahead lies Mote River;
    Past Mote River,
    Mountain upon mountain higher.
    Past Zuantian Slope,
    Clouds and mist roll down before the vehicle;
    The hazy clouds and trees appear in the sky,
    The peaks resemble waves in a smoky sea.
    Hezhang corn grows in the clouds,
    Weining cattle and sheep roam in the sky;
    Yi and Miao brothers seize nature's work,
    Busily building railways above the white clouds.
    When the sun comes out, the clouds and mist dissipate,
    Brocade ribbons adorn the mountain peaks;
    A Miao girl comes down the mountain,
    Her hair in double buns, white skirt, singing leisurely.
    Again I see the pagoda-like mountains ahead,
    Standing tall in the mountain valleys, emitting white clouds;
    They are not pagodas but blast furnaces,
    Copper, iron, lead, and zinc flow like water.
    The mountains are covered with earth furnaces,
    The mountains are filled with flowing molten metal;
    The motherland is busy smelting everywhere,
    Weining copper water flows with a jade-green light.
    The old desolate Wusa is no longer cold,
    Late buckwheat flowers are red in October;
    In the Yi, Miao, and Hui communes,
    Songs of production float in the clouds.
    Communism warms the barren peaks,
    The old Liangshan is swept by spring winds;
    Early buckwheat yields three thousand jin per mu,
    The communes everywhere report a bumper harvest.
    Suddenly, a patch of white in the sky,
    Is actually the Caohai Lake reflecting silver light,
    Wulongqing Mountain shines with the light from the sea,
    Pastoral songs carry from the boats harvesting water caltrop.

    威宁道上
    田兵
    过了七星关，
    前面墨特川；
    过了墨特川，
    一山高一山。
    过去钻天坡，
    云雾滚滚车前落；
    朦胧云树天上见，
    群峰烟涛似海波。
    赫章包谷云上长，
    威宁天上走牛羊；
    彝苗兄弟夺天工，
    忙修铁路白云上。
    太阳出时云雾收，
    锦绸万束披山头；
    苗家小妹下山来，
    双髻素裙歌悠悠。
    又见前山宝塔群，
    矗立山坳吐白云；
    不是宝塔是高炉，
    铜铁铅锌水滚滚。
    遍山都是土炉群，
    遍山都有金水滚；
    祖国到处冶炼忙，
    威宁铜水流碧光。
    乌撒旧荒不再冷，
    十月晚荞花正红；
    彝苗回族公社里，
    生产之歌飘云中。
    共产主义暖荒峰，
    旧日凉山刮春风；
    早荞亩产三千斤，
    公社处处报年丰。
    忽见天上一片白，
    原是草海泛银辉，
    乌龙箐山背海光闪，
    牧歌传出采菱船。
