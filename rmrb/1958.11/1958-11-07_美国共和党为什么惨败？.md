    Why Did the American Republican Party Suffer a Miserable Defeat?

    The American congressional and local elections held on November 4th concluded with the ruling Republican Party suffering its worst defeat since 1936. According to final statistics, excluding the newly established state of Alaska which has yet to hold elections, the Republican Party holds only thirty-four seats in the ninety-six-seat Senate (down from forty-seven in the previous session), and only one hundred and fifty-four seats in the four hundred and thirty-five-seat House of Representatives (down from two hundred in the previous session). Of the forty-eight governorships, Republicans hold only fourteen (down from nineteen in the previous session). In California, the old stronghold of Nixon and Knowland, the governorship, which had been held by the Republicans for sixteen years, was also snatched away by the Democrats. The Associated Press described the Republican Party's disastrous defeat as follows: "Across the country, Democratic candidates have ousted incumbent Republicans one after another... This is the first time in more than a century."

    Why did the Republican Party suffer such a disastrous defeat? Nixon attributed the reason to the Democrats' "hard work and excellent organization," which is, of course, self-deceiving nonsense. Democratic National Committee Chairman Butler attributed the Democratic victory to the American people's lack of confidence in the leadership ability of the Republican government, which only tells one side of the story. The real reason must be found in the disasters that the Republican government has brought to the American people in the two years since it continued in power in 1956.

    Like in 1952, the Republican Party came to power in the 1956 election by waving the banner of "peace and prosperity." However, what kind of "peace" and what kind of "prosperity" has it brought to the American people in the past two years?

    The past two years have been the two years in which the Eisenhower government's "brink of war" policy has developed to a state of madness. It instigated the rebellion of counter-revolutionary elements in Hungary, forced the European countries of the North Atlantic Group to agree to establish American missile bases, resolutely refused to stop nuclear weapons tests, and conspired to subvert the nationalist and nationalistic regimes of Syria, Indonesia, Haiti, and Venezuela. It has also carried out blatant armed aggression and war provocations in Lebanon and the Taiwan area. These actions have greatly intensified international tensions, seriously threatened world peace, and at the same time made the American people worry day and night, fearing that they would wake up one morning to find themselves dragged into a war created single-handedly by the American ruling group.

    The Eisenhower-Dulles policy towards China is the greatest threat to the security of the American people. China is a great country with 650 million strong and unyielding people, and the people of such a great country are not afraid of any military provocations and war threats. The Eisenhower government's rude interference in China's internal affairs, its attempt to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands, has not only aroused the resolute opposition of the Chinese people, but has also been condemned by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. Even its so-called allied countries have expressed uneasiness and dissatisfaction. The Eisenhower government's reactionary policy of being hostile to the Chinese people has put the American people in an increasingly dangerous situation.

    The Eisenhower government's attempt to alleviate the economic crisis by expanding armaments and preparing for war has only deepened the economic crisis further. Huge military expenditures have contributed to the crisis of overproduction and a serious financial crisis: the budget deficit for this year is as high as 12.2 billion US dollars, and the national debt has reached a historical peak of 280.8 billion US dollars. Industrial production has fallen to its lowest level since World War II, and prices and taxes have reached the highest level in American history. The number of unemployed people, according to the official, greatly reduced figures, is still as high as more than five million, and the lives of millions of ordinary American people have been severely hit by the economic crisis. The Republican government has tried its best to shift the burden of the economic crisis onto the American working people; in this election campaign, Nixon proposed a campaign platform of only reducing taxes for large enterprises, and Knowland clamored for the passage of the "right to work law" to weaken the strength of trade unions in order to further reduce the living standards of workers. Today, the so-called "prosperity" of the United States has become a laughing stock.

    The Republican government's domestic and foreign policies have completely gone bankrupt in the eyes of the American people. The storm stirred up by Eisenhower-Dulles in the Taiwan Strait has caused a huge storm of protests in the United States, which is a sharp manifestation of the American people's dissatisfaction with the Republican policy. This congressional and local election was conducted against such a background.

    In order to reverse this obviously unfavorable situation, both Eisenhower and Nixon personally went to important areas across the country to campaign for local Republican candidates. They once again revived the magic weapon of "peace and prosperity," touting the Republican Party's "achievements" at home in the past six years. They also played tricks on the Taiwan issue, talking about "not using force" and "ceasefire," attempting to repeat the old trick of using the peaceful settlement of the Korean War as an election slogan in 1952 and using the "peacemaker" of the Suez Canal War as an election capital in 1956 to achieve victory. However, most American voters used the method of voting for the Democratic Party to show that they did not believe any of the Republican Party's sweet talk, that they spurned the Republican Party and those Republican politicians who symbolized war adventures, and that they were dissatisfied and resisted the Eisenhower government's reactionary domestic and foreign policies!

    Of course, the fact that the Democratic Party has won a majority of seats in this election does not mean that the Democratic Party's domestic and foreign policies have won the trust of the American people.

    Everyone knows that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are two sides of a card in the hands of the American monopoly bourgeoisie, and they are birds of a feather. In terms of domestic and foreign policies, especially in terms of foreign policy, there is basically no difference between the two parties. The "brink of war" policy, atomic blackmail, and arms race policy pursued by Eisenhower-Dulles today are inherited from the policies of Truman and Acheson back then. What is the essential difference between the Truman Doctrine of that year and the Eisenhower Doctrine of today? Moreover, the Democratic Party originally controlled the previous Congress, and the various reactionary domestic and foreign policies implemented by the Republican government were originally jointly formulated with the cooperation of the Democratic Party. The result of the American election proved the failure of the Republican Party, but it cannot prove the victory of the Democratic Party. Because America's hypocritical bourgeois democratic system forces the American people to choose either the donkey (Democratic Party) or the elephant (Republican Party) in the old carousel game. Choosing the donkey is because you want to abandon the elephant, not because the donkey is better than the elephant. The American people can only choose one of two evils at present, which is the tragedy of their political life.

    Nevertheless, this disastrous defeat of the Republican Party still has a certain significance. On the one hand, the extreme right wing of the Republican Party suffered a heavy blow in this election. Knowland, who was most determined to be an enemy of the Chinese people and was notoriously known as "the senator from Taiwan," was forced to temporarily withdraw from the political arena due to his failure to run for governor of California, and Nixon, Dulles and others became more isolated. On the other hand, the Democratic Party, blessed by the American people's spurning of the Republican Party, has gained an overwhelming advantage in Congress. In order to further win the general election in 1960, including the presidential election, the Democratic Party will in the next two years entangle itself more with the Eisenhower government on procedural and detailed issues, and the contradictions between the two parties will be further expanded and the differences will increase. More importantly, the American people will increasingly clearly recognize the reactionary and harmful nature of the Eisenhower government's domestic and foreign policies. Therefore, it will be increasingly difficult for the Eisenhower government to continue to implement its current reactionary domestic and foreign policies.

    However, imperialism is imperialism after all, and reactionaries are reactionaries after all. American imperialism is the largest reactionary in the world. The resolute opposition and resistance to its reactionary domestic and foreign policies will not be easily contained. The people of the world must continue to wage a resolute and unremitting struggle against the aggressive and war-mongering policies of American imperialism.

### 美国共和党为什么惨败？

    美国共和党为什么惨败？
    11月4日举行的美国国会和地方选举，以执政的共和党遭受到1936年以来最惨的一次失败而告结束。根据最后的统计，除掉新成立的阿拉斯加州尚待选举外，在参议院的九十六席中，共和党仅占三十四席（上届是四十七席），众议院的四百三十五席，共和党仅占一百五十四席（上届是二百席）；四十八名州长，共和党仅占十四名（上届是十九名）。在尼克松和诺兰的老巢加利福尼亚州。共和党把持了十六年之久的州长位置，也被民主党夺去，美联社这样描写了共和党的惨败状况：“在全国各地，民主党的候选人纷纷赶走了执政的共和党人……这在一百多年来还是第一次。”
    为什么共和党会遭到这样的惨败？尼克松把原因归结为民主党“做了坚苦的努力而且组织工作做得很出色”，这当然是自欺欺人的胡扯。民主党全国委员会主席巴特勒把民主党所以取得胜利的原因说成是美国人民对共和党政府的领导能力缺乏信心，这也只说了事情的一面。真正的原因必须从共和党政府1956年继续执政的两年内带给美国人民的灾难中去找寻。
    同1952年一样，共和党在1956年的竞选中也是打着“和平和繁荣”的迷魂幡而上台的。然而，两年来它带给美国人民什么样的“和平”，什么样的“繁荣”呢？
    过去的两年是艾森豪威尔政府的“战争边缘”政策发展到疯狂程度的两年。它策动了匈牙利反革命分子的叛乱，强使北大西洋集团的欧洲各国同意建立美国的导弹基地，坚决拒绝停止核武器试验，阴谋颠覆叙利亚、印度尼西亚、海地和委内瑞拉的民族主义的和具有民族主义倾向的政权。它还先后在黎巴嫩和台湾地区进行公然的武装侵略和战争挑衅。这些行动大大地加剧了国际紧张局势，严重地威胁了世界和平，同时也使得美国人民日夜提心吊胆，害怕哪一天早上醒来发觉自己已被拖入一场美国统治集团所一手制造的战争中。
    艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯的对华政策，是对美国人民的安全的最大威胁。中国是一个拥有六亿五千万坚强不屈的人民的大国，这样一个伟大国家的人民是不害怕任何军事挑衅和战争威胁的。艾森豪威尔政府横蛮干涉中国内政，妄想阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿，不仅激起了中国人民的坚决反对，并且遭到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的同声谴责。甚至它的所谓同盟国家也纷纷表示不安和不满。艾森豪威尔政府与中国人民为敌的反动政策，使美国人民面临日益危险的境地。
    艾森豪威尔政府企图以扩军备战的政策来缓和经济危机，结果却使经济危机进一步深刻化。巨大的军费开支促成了生产过剩危机和严重的财政危机：本年度预算赤字高达一百二十二亿美元，国债创二千八百零八亿美元的历史最高峰。工业生产下降到第二次世界大战以来最低的水平，物价和捐税达到美国整个历史上的最高水平。失业人数仅仅根据官方大大缩小了的数字仍高达五百余万，千千万万美国普通人民的生活受到经济危机的严重打击。共和党政府千方百计地把经济危机的重担转嫁于美国劳动人民；在这次竞选中，尼克松提出了只对大企业减税的竞选政纲，诺兰叫嚣要通过“工作权法”，削弱工会的力量，以便进一步降低工人的生活水平。时至今日所谓美国的“繁荣”已经成为笑柄。
    共和党政府的内外政策在美国人民的心目中已经完全破产。艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯在台湾海峡掀起的风浪，造成了美国国内的巨大抗议风暴，这是美国人民对共和党政策不满的尖锐表现。这次的国会和地方选举，正是在这样的背景下进行的。
    为了挽回这种明显的不利形势，艾森豪威尔和尼克松都亲自到全国各重要地区为当地的共和党候选人竞选。他们还是重新祭起了“和平和繁荣”这个法宝，鼓吹共和党执政六年来在国内的“政绩”。他们还在台湾问题上玩弄“不使用武力”和“停火”的诡计，企图重演1952年以和平解决朝鲜战争作竞选号召、1956年以苏伊士运河战争的“和事佬”为竞选资本而取得胜利的故技。但是，大多数美国选民却用投民主党的票这个办法来表明他们不相信共和党的任何花言巧语，表明他们唾弃共和党和那些象征战争冒险的共和党政客，表明他们对艾森豪威尔政府的内外反动政策的不满和反抗！
    当然，民主党在这次选举中取得多数的议员席位，决不是表明民主党的内外政策得到了美国人民的信任。
    谁都知道，民主党和共和党是美国垄断资产阶级手中一张牌的两面，它们是一丘之貉。在内外政策方面，特别是在外交政策方面，两党是基本上没有什么差别的。艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯今天所奉行的“战争边缘”政策、原子讹诈和军备竞赛政策，正是从当年杜鲁门、艾奇逊的政策一脉相承下来的。当年的杜鲁门主义和今天的艾森豪威尔主义又有什么本质上的不同呢？而且民主党本来就控制着上届国会，共和党政府所推行的各种反动内外政策，本来就是在民主党的合作之下共同制定的。美国选举的结果是证明了共和党的失败，却不能证明是民主党的胜利。因为，美国的虚伪的资产阶级民主制度强迫美国人民只能在老一套的旋转木马游戏中不是选择驴子（民主党），就是选择象（共和党）。选择驴子是因为要抛弃象，并不是驴子比象高明。美国人民目前只能在两害之中择一害，这是他们的政治生活中的悲剧。
    虽然如此，这次共和党的惨败还是有其一定意义的。一方面，共和党的极右派在这次选举中受到了沉重的打击，最坚决地与中国人民为敌、以“来自台湾的参议员”而臭名昭著的诺兰由于竞选加利福尼亚州州长失败而被迫暂时退出政治舞台，尼克松、杜勒斯之流更加孤立。另一方面，民主党托福于美国人民的唾弃共和党而在国会取得了压倒优势，为了进一步取得1960年包括总统选举在内的大选的胜利，民主党在今后两年中将更多地在程序和细节问题上同艾森豪威尔政府纠缠，两党的矛盾将更加扩大，分歧将更加增多。更重要的是，美国人民将越来越清楚地认识到艾森豪威尔政府内外政策的反动性和危害性。因此，艾森豪威尔政府要继续执行目前的内外反动政策，将是越来越困难了。
    但是，帝国主义到底是帝国主义，反动派到底是反动派。美帝国主义是世界上最大的反动派。它的内外反动政策所遭到的坚决反对和抵抗，是不会轻易收敛的。全世界人民必须对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策继续不懈地进行坚决的斗争。
