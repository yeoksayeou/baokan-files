    On Viewing "Labor and Love"
    Sha Ying
    The original title of the Soviet film "Labor and Love" is "Height." It depicts the selfless labor and heroic spirit of Soviet construction workers working at high altitudes; at the same time, through the love stories of two young couples and plot twists full of comedic elements, it expresses the sincere and pure love established by new people in labor.
    In the old society, labor was synonymous with suffering. Laborers were the exploited and harmed "lower class." But in our socialist society, labor has become a glorious and heroic undertaking; laborers are now the masters of the new society. Therefore, how one treats labor and laborers is the most important criterion for judging a person's thinking and quality, and it is also a theme that artistic works should seriously and extensively reflect. In this film, the author realistically reflects the boiling construction life of the Soviet people and praises the noble qualities of the working class with concrete and vivid artistic images. They do not care about personal gains or losses, work actively, and are intelligent, brave, and dare to be creative. When continuous rainy weather affected the progress of the project, in order to race against time, installation team leader Dakmakov and the workers broke with the conservative ideas of the leaders, boldly put forward rationalization proposals, and successfully completed the installation of large metal structures, enabling the project to be completed ahead of schedule. This demonstrates the working class's pioneering spirit of daring to think and dare to do. Bassechnik, an outspoken installation worker, stepped forward when encountering difficulties in his work, risking his life to climb to a high altitude in the strong wind to rescue the metal structure, allowing the installation work to proceed smoothly. These are all very exciting. Their advanced ideas and heroic actions are shining with the light of communism.
    In the film, not only the people in labor and the heroes are lovely, but also the objects and environment in labor are lovely. Look, on that bustling construction site, blast furnaces soar into the clouds, cranes go up and down, locomotives emitting smoke call out, electric welders flash sparks, and red flags on blast furnaces flutter in the wind... colorful and dazzling, forming the most magnificent picture. This environment, this atmosphere, and the people inside are so beautiful and so lovely! They express the greatness of labor and the happiness of laborers, with strong and touching charm, inspiring people to love labor and arousing people's enthusiasm to actively participate in labor.
    Of course, there are still contradictions within socialist society, and a large number of them are contradictions between the advanced and the backward. On the issue of how to treat labor, due to different ideological awareness, everyone's attitude is different. Some people are for the collective and for communism, such as the heroic figures mentioned above. Some people think of both society and their own material interests, such as a worker in the film named Mecherisky. When a certain project is completed well, he says that he smells "the smell of bonuses in the air"! There are also a small number of people who are selfish, pursue enjoyment, do not work hard, always hope to gain more with less labor, and even harm others for their own benefit and harm the public for their own private interests; for example, Hagyink in the film works like "turtle racing," treating labor as "suffering." Once Bassechnik asked him: "How will you live in a communist society?" He actually said: "I am not in a hurry for communism. I am satisfied with socialism!" In our lives, there are also people like Hagyink. These people not only cannot see the brighter prospects of communism, wanting to stagnate in socialist society, and sometimes even want to retreat to capitalist society! The film satirizes and criticizes such characters, and enthusiastically praises and commends heroic characters, and in the comparison between the backward and the advanced, it further shows the nobility and loveliness of heroic figures such as Bassechnik!
    Love is an indispensable part of our lives. In the new society, love is truly free; however, whom to love and how to love are questions that some people have not yet resolved well in our real life. Some people love a person, paying attention only to their appearance, as for their thoughts, qualities, etc., they don't care or don't care much about. Some people, when choosing a partner, always consider whether the other party is a "level" cadre, how much their "monthly income" is, etc., staining love with the color of "class" and the smell of money! The treatment of love in this film is correct. Female welder Katya confessed to Bassechnik at the moment when he fell from a high altitude and his life was in danger. She didn't think that he might be disabled or die in the future. The reason why she loves him so passionately is because she loves his activeness and bravery in labor, and she loves his progressive thinking and noble qualities. When Masha and Telyabin left, it was precisely when Telyabin was promoted to take on a "very high" "new position." She didn't think about any material enjoyment or status. Why did she resolutely leave him? Because he pursued comfort and had bad qualities. Why did she love Dakmakov? Because he yearned for labor and because Dakmakov was an upright person and an advanced element. These two beautiful love stories are closely linked to labor, sincere and pure, reasonable and well-founded, and are enlightening and infectious to the audience, especially the young people.
    "Labor and Love" is a good film with educational significance. Especially when the Chinese people's communist labor enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high, and the mass movement of steelmaking and ironmaking is in full swing, when the vast audience sees this color film reflecting the Soviet people's construction of the steel industry base, they will feel particularly kind and delighted.

### 看“劳动与爱情”

    看“劳动与爱情”
    沙英
    苏联影片“劳动与爱情”的原名是“高空”。它是描写苏联建筑工人在高空作业中的忘我的劳动和英雄气概的；同时通过两对青年男女相爱的故事和充满喜剧性的情节，表现了新的人在劳动中建立起的真挚而纯洁的爱情。
    劳动，在旧社会里，是苦难的代名词。劳动者，是被剥削、被损害的“下等人”。可是在我们社会主义社会中，劳动却已变成一种光荣而豪迈的事业；劳动者，已是新社会的主人。因此，怎样对待劳动，怎样对待劳动者，是判定一个人的思想和品质的最重要的标准，也是艺术作品应当认真大量反映的主题。在这部影片中，作者以具体而鲜明的艺术形象，真实地反映了苏联人民沸腾的建设生活，歌颂了工人阶级的高贵品质。他们不计较个人的得失，积极劳动，而且机智勇敢，敢于大胆创造。当阴雨连绵的天气影响了工程的进度，为了跟时间赛跑，安装队队长达克麻阔夫和工人们，打破领导者的保守思想，大胆地提出合理化建议，胜利完成了大型金属结构的安装，使工程提前竣工。表现了工人阶级敢想敢做的首创精神。性格爽朗的安装工人巴谢奇尼克，在工作遇到困难的关头，便挺身而出，冒着生命的危险，在大风中爬上高空，去抢救金属结构，使安装工作得以顺利进行下去。这些都是十分激动人心的。他们的先进思想和英雄行为，闪烁着共产主义的光芒。
    在影片中，不仅劳动中的人、英雄是可爱的，就是劳动中的物、环境也是可爱的。你看，在那轰轰烈烈的工地上，高炉耸入云霄，起重机上上下下，冒着烟的机车呼叫着，电焊闪烁着火花，高炉上的红旗迎风招展……，五采缤纷，光耀夺目，组成了最壮丽的画面。这种环境，这种气氛和这里边的人，是多么美，是多么可爱！它们表现了劳动的伟大和劳动者的愉快，富有强烈的感人的魅力，鼓舞着人们热爱劳动，也激起了人们积极参加劳动的热情。
    当然，在社会主义社会内部还是有矛盾的，其中大量存在的是先进和落后的矛盾。在对待劳动这个问题上，由于思想觉悟的不同，各人的态度也不一样。有的人是为了集体，为了共产主义，例如上面所说的那些英雄人物。有的人是既为社会而又常为个人的物质利益着想，例如影片中一个名叫梅切里斯基的工人，当一种工程搞好之后，他说在空气里就闻到“一股奖金的气味”！还有少数人则是自私自利，追求享受，不好好劳动，总希望少劳多得，甚至损人利己，害公为私；例如影片中的哈银克，干活就像“乌龟赛跑”一样，把劳动当作“受罪”。有一次巴谢奇尼克问他：“到了共产主义社会怎样生活？”他竟这样说：“我不着急共产主义，我呀！在社会主义就知足啦！”在我们的生活中间，像哈银克这类人也是有的，这类人不仅看不见共产主义更光明的前景，想停滞在社会主义社会，有时甚至想退回到资本主义社会去呢！影片对于这类人物作了讽刺和批判，对于英雄人物作了热情的歌颂和赞扬，并在落后和先进的比照之下，更显示了巴谢奇尼克等英雄人物的高贵和可爱！
  　爱情，是我们生活中不可缺少的一部分。在新社会中，恋爱是真正自由的了；但是，爱什么人，怎样爱法？在我们的现实生活中，有些人还没有很好地解决这个问题。有的人爱一个人，光注意外表，至于她的思想、品质等等，那是不管或不大管的。有的人选择对象，总多考虑对方是“那一级”的干部，每月“收入多少”等等，将爱情沾染上“等级”的颜色和钱臭的气味！这部影片对待爱情的处理是正确的。电焊女工卡嘉爱巴谢奇尼克，是在他从高空摔下来，带有生命危险的时刻向他表白的，她没有想到他将来可能残废或死亡。她所以热烈地爱他，是爱他在劳动中的积极和英勇，是爱他的思想进步和具有高贵的品质。玛莎和捷良宾离开的时候，正是捷良宾被提升去担任“很高”的“新职务”的时候，她没有想到什么物质享受和地位。她为什么毅然地离开他？是因为他追求安逸，品质恶劣。她为什么爱达克麻阔夫，因为他向往劳动，因为达克麻阔夫是个正派人，是个先进分子。这两个优美的爱情故事，密切结合着劳动，真挚而纯洁，合情合理，对于观众，特别是对于年轻人，是有启发和感染的。
    “劳动与爱情”是一部具有教育意义的好影片。特别是当目前我国人民共产主义的劳动热情空前高涨，炼钢炼铁的群众运动正在轰轰烈烈的开展的时候，广大观众看到这部反映苏联人民建设钢铁工业基地的彩色影片时，会格外觉得亲切和欢欣。
