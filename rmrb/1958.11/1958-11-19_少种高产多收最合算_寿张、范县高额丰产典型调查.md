Planting Less, High Yield, More Harvest is Most Cost-Effective
Investigation of High-Yield Models in Shou Zhang and Fan County

Is it cost-effective to plant less, achieve high yields, and reap more harvest? To further clarify this issue, we recently conducted this investigation.

    I. Late Corn in Taiqian Management Area, Shou Zhang People's Commune

We investigated three types: one was a 1.3-mu corn "satellite field" with a yield of 35,062 jin per mu; one was a medium-high yield field with a yield of 8,000 jin per mu; and the other was a general field with a yield of 3,000 jin per mu.

    (1) Labor and Production Costs of the Satellite Field with a Yield of 35,062 Jin per Mu: 1. Plowing, harrowing, and weeding: Deep plowing to a depth of four chi, heavy plowing of 1.5 meters before sowing, harrowing fifteen times, plus repairing ridges, inter-tilling, and weeding, totaling 40 workdays; 2. Fertilization: Applying 478,000 jin of coarse fertilizer, 2,700 jin of fine fertilizer, totaling 70 workdays; 3. Sowing: 4 workdays; 4. Irrigation: 20 workdays; 5. Harvesting: 8 workdays; 6. Other: 12 workdays, totaling 154 workdays. 7. Production costs: 1,326.2 yuan.

    (2) Medium-High Yield Field with a Yield of 8,000 Jin per Mu: Totaling 106 workdays, production costs: 295 yuan.

    (3) General Field with a Yield of 3,000 Jin per Mu: Totaling 48 workdays, production costs: 67.1 yuan.

From the perspective of the labor used, production costs, and the production results obtained in the above three types, the deeper the plowing and the more fertilizer applied, the greater the results achieved. The satellite field used an average of 154 workdays per mu, which is 145% of the medium-high yield field and 321% of the ordinary field. The production costs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.) of the satellite field were 1,326.2 yuan, which is 450% of the medium-high yield field and 1,976% of the ordinary field. However, the average yield per mu of the satellite field was 438% of the medium-high yield field and 1,168% of the ordinary field. The average grain production per workday: 228 jin for the satellite field, 76 jin for the medium-high yield field, and 63 jin for the ordinary field. This investigation shows that although the satellite field used more than twice the labor days of the ordinary field, its output value increased elevenfold.

    II. Peanuts in Sucun Production Brigade, Wangzhuangji Production Management Area, Fan County People's Commune

The Sucun Production Brigade planted a total of 450 mu of peanuts this year, with an average yield of 11,825 jin per mu. Among them, 25 mu yielded 30,743 jin per mu, and 5 mu of satellite fields averaged 53,408 jin per mu, becoming the largest peanut satellite in the country this year. Even based on the average yield of 11,825 jin per mu for the 450 mu, it is more than 31 times the average yield of 364 jin per mu in 1957.

    (1) Labor Input for Satellite Field with a Yield of 53,408 Jin per Mu: 1. Seed selection: selecting by plant, selecting by fruit, shelling, selecting by grain, using 8.9 workdays; 2. Plowing and preparing the land: winter plowing 0.5 chi, deep plowing 1.5 chi, winter irrigation once, spring harrowing three times, rolling once, spring plowing 0.4 chi, fine harrowing four times, preparing into ridges, using 38 workdays; 3. Sowing: soaking seeds in warm water, treating seeds with medicine, watering when sowing, using 10.3 workdays; 4. Inter-tilling and weeding: weeding four times, pulling weeds three times, using 4 workdays; 5. Fertilizing and topdressing: applying base fertilizer, topdressing chemical fertilizer, watering with manure and urine, spraying phosphorus, using 55.5 workdays; 6. Hilling and surrounding seedlings: three times, using 30 workdays; 7. Watering: five times, using 12 workdays; 8. Pest control: three times, using 2.5 workdays; 9. Harvesting: using 60 workdays; totaling 221.2 workdays.

    (2) High-Yield Field with a Yield of 30,743 Jin per Mu: Totaling 135.5 workdays.

    (3) General Field with a Yield of 5,240 Jin per Mu: Totaling 90.9 workdays.

Comparing the above three types of fields: the satellite field used 0.63 times more labor than the high-yield field, and the yield was 0.73 times higher than the high-yield field; the satellite field used 1.43 times more labor than the general field, and the yield was 9.18 times higher; the high-yield field used 0.49 times more labor than the general field, and the yield was 4.86 times higher.

From the above two investigative materials, it can be seen that although the labor input of the satellite field is greater than that of the general field, the yield is several times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times higher than that of the general field; although the costs are higher, the yield is also multiplied. Therefore, it is not a losing proposition to carefully manage crops and invest more labor and capital; rather, it is very worthwhile.

It should also be noted that because high-yield fields have been deeply plowed and transformed, and more fertilizer has been applied, the soil fertility has not been exhausted this year, and the fertilizer effect is still very significant. Even if deep plowing is no longer carried out next year, and the same amount of fertilizer is no longer applied, very good crops can still be grown. In fact, not all farmland needs to be deeply plowed every year. This year is the first year of large-scale deep plowing, and more labor will inevitably be used. Moreover, high-yield fields are all planted as experimental fields this year; since it is an experiment, more labor will inevitably be spent. In the future, with rich experience in high-yields, manpower will be greatly saved.

    少种高产多收最合算
    寿张、范县高额丰产典型调查
    究竟少种、高产、多收合不合算。为了进一步明确这个问题，最近我们作了这个调查。
        一、寿张人民公社台前管理区晚玉米
    我们一共调查了三个类型，一个是一点三亩玉米卫星田，亩产三万五千零六十二斤，一个是亩产八千斤的中等丰产田，另一个是亩产三千斤的一般田。
    （一）亩产三万五千零六十二斤的卫星田用工量和生产费用：1、耕耙锄：深翻四尺，播种前重翻一点五公尺，耙十五次，加上修畦田、中耕锄草共用工四十个；2、施肥：施粗肥四十七万八千斤，细肥二千七百斤，用工七十个；3、播种：用工四个；4、灌水：用工二十个；5、收获：用工八个；6、其他：用工十二个，共用工一百五十四个。7、生产费用：一千三百二十六点二元。
    （二）亩产八千斤中等丰产田：共用工一百零六个，生产费用：二百九十五元。
    （三）亩产三千斤一般田：共用工四十八个，生产费用：六十七点一元。
    从上述三种类型使用的劳力与生产成本及取得的生产成果来看，深翻地越深，施肥越多，取得的成果越大。卫星田每亩平均用工一百五十四个，为一般丰产田的145％，普通田的321％；卫星田生产费用（种子、肥料、农药等）一千三百二十六点二元，为中等丰产田的450％，普通田的1，976％；而每亩平均产量，卫星田则为中等丰产田的438％，为一般田的1，168％；每个劳动日平均产粮：卫星田为二百二十八斤，中等丰产田为七十六斤，普通田为六十三斤。从这个调查可以看出：卫星田虽比普通田多用劳动日二倍多，但其产值则增加十一倍。
        二、范县人民公社王庄集生产管理区苏村生产大队的花生
    苏村生产大队今年共种花生四百五十亩，平均亩产一万一千八百二十五斤；其中有二十五亩亩产三万零七百四十三斤；有五亩卫星田平均亩产五万三千四百零八斤，成为今年全国最大的花生卫星。就以四百五十亩大面积平均亩产一万一千八百二十五斤计算，也超过1957年平均亩产三百六十四斤的三十一倍多。
    （一）亩产五万三千四百零八斤的卫星田用工量：1、选种：棵选、果选、剥皮、粒选，用工八点九个；2、翻地整地：冬耕零点五尺，深翻一点五尺，冬灌一次，春耙三遍，滚轧一遍，春耕零点四尺，细耙四遍，整成畦田，用工三十八个；3、下种：温汤浸种、药剂拌种、浇地下种，用工十点三个；4、中耕锄草：锄四遍，拔草三次，用工四个；5、施肥追肥：施底肥、追化肥、浇粪尿、喷磷，用工五十五点五个；6、拥土围秧：三次，用工三十个；7、浇水：五次，用工十二个；8、治虫：三次，用工二点五个；9、收获：用工六十个；共用工二百二十一点二个。
    （二）亩产三万零七百四十三斤的丰产田，共用工一百三十五点五个。
    （三）亩产五千二百四十斤的一般田，共用工九十点九个。
    以上三类田比较：卫星田比丰产田多用工零点六三倍，产量比丰产田高零点七三倍；卫星田比一般田多用工一点四三倍，产量高九点一八倍；丰产田比一般田多用工零点四九倍，产量高四点八六倍。
    从以上两个调查材料中可以看出：卫星田虽然用工量比一般田大一些，但产量却比一般田高几倍、十几倍甚至几十倍；成本虽然大一些，产量也是倍增。因此，对作物加工管理，苦心经营，多用些工本，不是划不来，而是很上算的。
    还应当看到：高产田由于深翻改造，多施肥料，今年的地力并未用完，肥效仍然很大，来年即使不再深翻，不再施那样多的肥料，仍然可以长出很好的庄稼。事实上，所有农田每年也不一定都要深翻。今年，是大规模深翻地的第一年，用工必然多一些。而且对高额丰产田，今年都当试验田种；既是试验，就免不了多费些工。今后，有了丰富的高额丰产经验，人力会大大节省。
