Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Provinces (municipalities), autonomous regions, and units such as the military and state organs throughout the country have selected nearly five thousand outstanding individuals from among young people in various positions to attend the Second National Congress of Youth Socialist Construction Activists to be held in Beijing. As of the 18th, a total of 4,226 youth activists and representatives of advanced youth collectives had reported their arrival in Beijing.

After the news of the Third National Committee of the Communist Youth League's Second Plenary Session's decision to convene the Second National Congress of Youth Socialist Construction Activists was released, youth leagues and the broad masses of young people in various localities took welcoming the congress as a driving force to promote the current socialist construction and encourage themselves. Young people in more than ten provinces and cities, including Anhui, Guangdong, Sichuan, Henan, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, launched production competitions of "Rendering Meritorious Service for Socialist Construction."

Youth activists from all over the country arrived in Beijing with extreme excitement and elation. Along the way, the most talked about and concerned questions among the youth activists were: What shall we take to see Chairman Mao? How shall we respond to the Party's care for young people? What should we bring back from the meeting? They made guarantees one after another, using the spirit of going all out and aiming high to make the congress a success. The Shandong representatives resolved to bring back "Six Treasures" from the congress: (1) Bring back the instructions of the Party Central Committee; (2) Bring back the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the spirit of the congress; (3) Bring back the advanced experience of fraternal regions; (4) Bring back the news from the capital in the Great Leap Forward; (5) Bring back the friendship of the young people of various provinces and cities and Beijing; (6) Bring back the achievements of participating in voluntary labor in the capital.

The arrival of the youth activists was warmly welcomed and received by the youth of the capital. The city's youth also prepared to be divided into fourteen units and regions to invite activists from various places to give reports, hold discussions, and have get-togethers. This afternoon, youth activists Huang Baomei, Zhao Dean, and Wang Baojing were invited to report their exemplary deeds to 4,000 young people in the Cultural Palace of the Working People. Tonight, four units, including the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Communist Youth League Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the CPC Central Committee, the Communist Youth League Committee of the Central State Organs, and the Youth Department of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, also held a welcome party to welcome the youth activists arriving in Beijing.
