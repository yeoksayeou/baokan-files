Thinking about Nolan's Loss

Dong Fengya

The farce of the American election has just played out, leaving only the disappointed face of a notorious person in the memory. In the Republican Party's crushing defeat, Nolan lost the election. It is said that he has announced that he will no longer run for election, but will instead change careers to become an assistant publisher of a newspaper.

For those who aspire to a career on the current American political stage, it is still a convenient path to first learn how to do business, or, to put it more plainly, to make more money. Didn't Rockefeller get elected as the Governor of New York because he spent a lot of dollars? However, before changing careers, shouting something like "no longer running for election" etc., could it be that he really realized that he has "become a pile of dog shit that is despised by mankind" and is disheartened?

In fact, Nolan doesn't have to be like this at all.

Because first, people in the United States who "become a pile of dog shit despised by mankind" did not start with Nolan, nor is Nolan the only one. Not to mention those further back, MacArthur a few years ago is one example. This American general, who was once prominent in the World War, only suffered a few defeats on the Korean battlefield, which made the American people see through the false image of the American government's "anti-aggression" policy. Under the fierce opposition of the people, first MacArthur himself was reduced to a frustrated officer and an obscure clown; then the ruling Democratic Party and President Truman also fell. Eisenhower, who was as famous as MacArthur in World War II, who is now still temporarily sitting in the American presidential seat, how much better can he be than MacArthur? Eisenhower was fortunate that he had not been sent to the Korean battlefield. Therefore, when MacArthur was devalued for his reactionary behavior, Eisenhower was able to put on the badge of a hero of World War II and swaggeringly become president. However, he avoided the Korean battlefield, but he could not escape the nooses that he put around his own neck, especially on the Taiwan Strait issue, Dulles, Nixon, and Eisenhower will not be able to escape the fate of "a pile of dog shit despised by mankind." We have heard more than once from the United States the call to oust Dulles. And in this American election, the president personally went into battle, desperately shouting that his six years in office were the best six years in American history, but he could not save the Republican Party from a crushing defeat. One after another, with so many big figures accompanying him, Nolan can be comforted.

Secondly, although the Republican Party has been abandoned by the American people because of its reactionary domestic and foreign policies, this does not mean the Republican Party's future is hopeless. For many years, the American political situation can be said to be a two-party rotation system. The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are birds of a feather, the crow is no whiter than the pig. Among them, when one is in power, the other is preparing to take office next time, and the result is always changing in this regular way. It can be predicted that if no unexpected changes occur in American society in the next few years, the Republican Party will always have a chance to become the victor again. The Republican and Democratic parties are merely two deceptive broken magic weapons in the hands of the American big bourgeoisie, turning them back and forth to deceive the people. If one does not work, switch to the other; if the other does not work, bring out the original one again. This is why whoever is in power steps down, and after a rotation, they come back to power. This is also the essence of the democratic politics that our right-wing heroes vigorously praise, that "if you can't do it, I'll come; if I can't do it, you'll come."

However, the rotation is by no means a completely unchanged cycle, but only because it is still in a process of quantitative accumulation. The fact that some people in power are knocked down by the people and "become a pile of dog shit despised by mankind" is evidence. This quantitative change will probably continue for some time, but the day of qualitative change will eventually come, and that is the day when the American people overthrow the rule of monopoly capital and eradicate the Republican and Democratic parties. At that time, Nolan will really be heartbroken!

    从诺兰落选想到的
    董逢亚
    美国选举的闹剧刚刚演过，留在印象中的，却只剩了一个臭名远扬的人的失意面孔。在共和党的惨败中，诺兰落选了。据说他已宣布今后再不进行竞选，而是要改行去当一家报纸的助理发行人了。
    有志于美国目前政治舞台生涯的人，先去学一学做生意，更明白地说，就是去多弄几个钱，倒还是一个方便的路。洛克菲勒不就是因为花了大量美元，才当选为纽约州长的吗？但是，在改行之前，大喊什么“再不进行竞选”云云，莫非他果真因为觉察到自己已经“变为不齿于人类的狗屎堆”而心灰意冷了?？
    其实，诺兰是大可不必这样的。
    因为第一，在美国“变为不齿于人类的狗屎堆”的人，绝不是由诺兰开始的，也绝不只诺兰一人。远的不说，前几年的麦克阿瑟就是一个。这位在世界大战中煊赫一时的美国将军，也只是在朝鲜战场上吃了几个败仗，便使美国人民看清了美国政府“反侵略”政策的假像，在人民的激烈反对之下，先是麦氏本人沦为失意军官而又默默无闻的小丑；接着执政的民主党和杜鲁门总统也都滚了下来。在第二次世界大战中同麦氏齐名的艾森豪威尔，也就是现在还暂时坐在美国总统位子上的那一位，又能比麦氏强多少？艾比麦幸运的是他未曾被派到朝鲜战场上去。所以当麦氏因反动受贬的时候，艾氏反而还能冒着世界大战功臣的牌号，洋洋洒洒地当起总统来。但是，他躲过了朝鲜战场，却逃不过他自己套在脖子上的那些绞索，特别是在台湾海峡问题上，杜勒斯、尼克松、艾森豪威尔都将逃不开“不齿于人类的狗屎堆”的命运。我们不只一次听到从美国传来要赶杜勒斯下台的呼声。而这次的美国选举，总统御驾亲征，到处拼命大喊他执政的六年是美国历史上最好的六年，也不能挽救共和党一败涂地的命运。先先后后，有如此众多的大人物作陪，诺兰是可以聊以自慰的了。
    再有第二，共和党虽然由于自己的反动内外政策，被美国人民抛掉了。但这并不等于共和党将来的绝望。多年来的美国政局，大体上可说是两党轮休制。共和党和民主党，原是一丘之貉，老鸹并不比猪白。它们之中，这一个在执政，那一个就准备着下次上台，而结果也总是这样有规律地在变换。可以预料，美国社会在最近几年，倘不发生意外的变化，共和党总还有机会再成为胜利者的。共和、民主两党，不过是美国大资产阶级手里的两件骗人的破法宝，颠来倒去地用来欺骗人民，这件不中用了，换另一件；另一件又不中用了，再拿出原来那件来，这便是为什么谁执政谁下台，而轮过一转以后又来执政的原因。也就是我们的右派英雄所大力赞美的那“你不行我来，我不行你来”的民主政治的实质。
    但是，轮换决不是丝毫没有变化的循环，而只不过是它还处于一种量变的积累过程中，每一次循环中，总要有一些当权人物被人民打落而“变为不齿于人类的狗屎堆”便是证据。这种量变大概还要继续一个时候，但发生质变的一天终归要到来，那就是美国人民打倒垄断资本的统治，连根挖掉民主、共和两党的那一天。到那时，才真要使诺兰大伤心呢！
