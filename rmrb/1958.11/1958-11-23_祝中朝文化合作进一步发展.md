    Wishing Further Development of Sino-Korean Cultural Cooperation
    Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the People's Republic of China
    Today, as the Chinese people welcome the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea led by Premier Kim Il-sung with unparalleled excitement, it is also the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement. This is truly a double celebration, and the Chinese people are celebrating this festival, which marks the growing friendship between China and Korea, with redoubled joy. The Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed five years ago is an agreement that embodies the interests and aspirations of the people of China and Korea, and an agreement that embodies a new type of international relationship of friendship, equality, mutual assistance, and cooperation between socialist countries. This agreement has played a significant role in promoting the economic construction and cultural prosperity of China and Korea and in enhancing the brotherly friendship between the people of China and Korea. Today, as we look back on the development of Sino-Korean cultural cooperation over the past five years, we can say with satisfaction that our governments of China and Korea have faithfully implemented this agreement and achieved the lofty goals of signing it.
    Since 1955, the governments of China and Korea have signed annual cultural cooperation plans year by year, enabling our cultural cooperation to enter a new stage of planned development. The scope of our cooperation has also expanded to all aspects of culture, art, science, health, and sports, and we have created a variety of forms of cooperation. Our cooperation is becoming more comprehensive, extensive, and in-depth.
    Over the past five years, we have sent various cultural delegations to each other to conduct inspections and exchange experiences, and we have sent art troupes, writers, journalists, artists, musicians, and dramatists to each other to perform or create works. We have sent teachers, students, and graduate students to each other to teach or study. We have held various exhibitions and reports introducing each other's political, economic, and cultural life, and we have translated and published each other's books and staged each other's plays. In addition, many units of the cultural departments of our two countries have established contacts and frequently exchange information. It must be pointed out that the scale of cultural exchanges between the two countries is actually much wider. In previous years, a large number of literary and art workers participated in the work of the Chinese People's Comfort Groups to Korea and the Korean People's Delegations to China, and they made important contributions to the cause of Sino-Korean cultural exchange. The Chinese People's Volunteers were an even greater force in Sino-Korean cultural exchange. They brought Chinese national culture to Korea and Korean national culture back to China. That is to say, the scale and depth of Sino-Korean cultural exchanges over the past few years cannot be estimated in numbers.
    The reason why cultural cooperation between China and Korea is in the interests of the people of both countries is because it has a common foundation, that is, it serves the socialist construction of China and Korea and the struggle against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and it is carried out in accordance with the internationalist principle of sincere mutual assistance. Precisely because of this, it has promoted the mutual understanding and brotherly friendship between the people of China and Korea, promoted the upsurge of cultural undertakings in China and Korea, and played a positive role in the socialist construction and revolutionary struggles of China and Korea. In 1955 and 1956, the Korean Education Inspection Group visited our country and thoroughly examined our educational system and teaching experience. In 1957, the Chinese Art Workers Delegation spent two months deeply and systematically investigating the development of Korean art, studying the experience of Korea in developing art, and learning many Korean dances. Over the past few years, the exchange of art troupes between the two sides has greatly enriched the cultural life of the people of the two countries and enriched the content of artistic activities by performing for the vast number of workers, farmers, students, and soldiers. The Korean classical masterpiece "Chunhyangjeon" has been adapted into Yue opera, Ping opera, and other national forms and widely performed in various parts of our country. Korean films such as "The Guerrilla Girl" and "Fisherman's Song" were shown in China, allowing the Chinese people to vividly see the strong spirit and heroic spirit of the Korean people in fighting imperialism, and further encouraging the Chinese people's will to fight. Such examples are too numerous to list.
    Socialist countries have many creative achievements and experiences in socialist construction, and achievements and experiences in cultural construction are naturally an important part of them.
    Cultural exchange and cooperation undoubtedly help exchange experiences and learn from each other. This exchange and learning is an indispensable part of the development and prosperity of our cultural undertakings. We have always attached importance to cultural cooperation between socialist countries and will make greater efforts to promote its development.
    At present, China is going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and Korea is galloping on the Chollima on the road of socialism. The cultural undertakings of our two countries, like other construction projects, are also developing and improving vigorously. It is certain that cultural exchange between China and Korea will be developed more extensively.
    Let me wish further development and improvement of Sino-Korean cultural exchange.

    祝中朝文化合作进一步发展
    中华人民共和国对外文化联络委员会主任　张奚若
    今日，中国人民以无比兴奋的心情热烈欢迎由金日成首相率领的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团的时候，正好是中朝经济及文化合作协定签订五周年的日子。这真是双喜临门，中国人民以加倍的欢欣来庆祝这个标志着中朝友谊日益增进的节日。五年前签订的中朝经济及文化合作协定是一个体现中朝两国人民利益和愿望的协定，体现社会主义国家之间友好、平等、互助合作的新型的国际关系的协定。这个协定，对于促进中朝两国的经济建设和文化事业的繁荣，对于增进中朝两国人民的兄弟友谊，起了重大的作用。今天，我们回顾五年来中朝文化合作事业发展的情况，可以满意地指出，我们中朝两国政府忠实地执行了这一协定，实现了签订这一协定的崇高目的。
    从1955年起，中朝两国政府就逐年签订年度文化合作计划，使我们的文化合作事业进入了一个新的、有计划地发展的阶段。我们合作的范围也发展到文化、艺术、科学、卫生、体育各个方面，并且创造了多种多样的合作形式。我们的合作已经日益走向全面、广泛和深入。
    五年来，我们互派了各种文化性的代表团到对方进行考察交流经验，互派了艺术团、作家、记者、美术家、音乐家、戏剧家到对方进行表演或者创作，互派了教员、留学生和研究生到对方进行教学或学习。我们相互举办了各种介绍对方的政治、经济、文化生活的展览会、报告会，翻译出版了对方的书籍，上演了对方的戏剧。此外，我们两国文化部门的不少单位之间还建立了联系，经常交换资料。必须指出，两国文化交流的规模实际上还要广泛得多，历年中国人民赴朝慰问团和朝鲜人民访华代表团中都有大批的文艺工作者参加了工作，他们在中朝文化交流事业中作出了重要的贡献，而中国人民志愿军更是中朝文化交流中的一支巨大力量。他们把中国的民族文化带到了朝鲜，又把朝鲜的民族文化带回中国。这就是说，几年来中朝文化交流的规模和深度实在是无法用数字来估计的。
    中朝两国间的文化合作之所以符合于两国人民的利益是因为它有着共同的基础，那就是，它是为中朝两国的社会主义建设和为反对共同敌人美帝国主义斗争服务的，它是遵循着真诚的相互帮助的国际主义原则而进行的。正因为这样，它促进了中朝两国人民的相互了解和兄弟友谊，促进了中朝两国文化事业的高涨，对中朝两国的社会主义建设和革命斗争起了积极的作用。1955年和1956年，朝鲜教育考察团在我国访问期间，详细地考察了我国的教育制度和教学经验。1957年，中国艺术工作者代表团以两个月的时间深入地、系统地考察了朝鲜艺术事业发展的情况，研究了朝鲜发展艺术工作的经验，并学会了许多朝鲜的舞蹈。几年来双方艺术团体的往来，为广大的工人、农民、学生、士兵进行演出，大大丰富了两国人民的文化生活，丰富了两国艺术活动的内容。朝鲜的古典名剧“春香传”，曾被改编成越剧、评剧等各种民族形式，在我国各地广泛上演。朝鲜电影“游击队的姑娘”、“渔郎川”等在中国上演，使中国人民形象地看到了朝鲜人民和帝国主义进行斗争的坚强精神和英雄气概，也进一步鼓舞了中国人民的斗争意志，这样的事例是不胜列举的。
    社会主义各国在社会主义建设方面都有着不少的创造性的成就和经验，文化方面的建设成就和经验自然是其中一个重要的组成部分。
    文化交流和合作无疑地有助于经验交流和相互学习。这种交流和学习，对于我国文化事业的发展和繁荣，是一个不可缺少的部分。我们向来重视社会主义国家之间的文化合作，并且将以更大的努力，来促进它的发展。
    目前，中国正在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，朝鲜正跨上了千里马在社会主义的道路上疾驰猛进。我们两国的文化事业也像其它各项建设一样，在蓬勃发展和提高。可以肯定，中朝两国间的文化交流事业将获得更广泛的开展。
    让我预祝中朝文化交流事业的进一步发展和提高。
