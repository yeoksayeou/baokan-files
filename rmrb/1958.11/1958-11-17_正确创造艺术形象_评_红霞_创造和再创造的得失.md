Correctly Create Artistic Images
——On the Successes and Failures of the Creation and Re-creation of "Hongxia"
Ma Shaobo

Our literature and art have a creative tradition of combining realism and romanticism. The combination of militant realism and positive romanticism has made many literary and artistic works of past dynasties radiate immortal brilliance. In today's era of the Great Leap Forward, we need to inherit and carry forward this tradition more conscientiously. Chairman Mao pointed out that the creative method of our literature and art should be a combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. As Comrade Zhou Yang said, "This is a scientific summary of the entire history of literature, and it is a very correct proposition put forward based on the characteristics and needs of the current era. It should become the common goal of all our literary and artistic workers."

The reason why artistic images in excellent works are so touching is often due to the correct application of the method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, which makes the characters real and vivid, achieving a level of prominence and richness, and a higher spiritual realm. To achieve this, we must start from the authenticity of the characters' thoughts, personalities, and lives, and we must accurately grasp the characteristics of the characters' living environment to carry out artistic conception and give play to artistic imagination. The creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism is not unrelated to the writer's worldview, and it is not even a general relationship. The latter is the foundation of the former.

I have seen many different opera versions of "Hongxia" one after another; I have also read the original opera and the adapted versions for film and Kunqu opera, and I feel that the adaptations have greatly enriched and developed the story. This is very gratifying. Therefore, I would like to explore the gains and losses in the development of this play.

"Hongxia" depicts the story of a rural girl named Hongxia in the old revolutionary base area of Jiangxi, who bravely fought against the Kuomintang reactionaries more than 20 years ago. It is one of the most popular plays at present. The story conception and musical creation of the original opera are still quite successful. The author made an artistic generalization based on some related fragmentary legends. These legends are full of brilliance. This is very similar to the original legend of "The White-Haired Girl." Using it as creative material, one can greatly unleash imagination to reflect the era of a revolutionary period and the heroic struggle of the people. I think the author's creative intention is precisely this.

A good work of art often depends on the depth of expression of life's contradictions, because only by doing this can it produce exciting power; however, in order to express the depth of life's contradictions, the development of events and the conflict between characters must be placed on the foundation of real life, making it more prominent and sharper, and thus able to show the complexity of the struggle. Because with this solid and reliable foundation, the artistic conception can be as complete and reasonable as possible, the wings of imagination can fly higher, and the more trust and persuasiveness it can generate in the audience. Only in this way can the purpose of educating the audience be achieved.

The original "Hongxia" did not pay enough attention to this fundamental issue. The author focused on rendering bizarre and thrilling plots, only caring about placing the characters in sharp conflicts and pursuing some superficial effects, while quite neglecting the depiction of the reality of life and the typicality of the characters, thus making people feel an undue superficiality and falsehood in life and the characters, greatly damaging the characters and lowering the ideological nature of the work. The original work has oversimplified and downgraded defects in writing about the Party, the Red Army, the revolutionary masses, and even the negative characters.

For example, the severity of the White Terror, which is indeed the reality of historical life and also a side that must be reflected in the work; but this is only one aspect, and it is not the main and overwhelming aspect in either historical life or the work. For a period of time, the enemy's intrusion into the Soviet area had a great advantage in strength, and the people were thus subjected to cruel persecution, but the dominant aspect was that the revolutionary people carried out a heroic struggle against the enemy for a long time to welcome their own liberation. When writing about the struggle in the old base areas, if the spiritual strength of the masses in overcoming the enemy in an inferior situation is not fully written out, it will be difficult to reflect the true face of history.

The original work initially puts the masses in a fairly peaceful and paralyzed situation, and then suddenly pushes them into an abyss of panic and misery. Let's look at a passage from the lyrics of the village cadre Qingshan: "The fire is burning, folks! Disaster is coming, children! Is it my old eyes that are blurred? Or is it a nightmare? This morning at dawn, I went to the front line to deliver grain, and met the Red Army retreating to the rear, the White Army's artillery fire chasing after them, smoke covering the village, folks with tears in their faces, people in panic, you hear the sound of cannons approaching step by step, you see the Red Guards have returned to the village. The White Army in the south is rampant, and the Japanese devils are attacking in the north again, could it be that the world is about to change? Ah! I only feel that the world is shaking."

Such lyrics are not isolated. The typical environment of the Red Army's northward march against Japan, as depicted by the author, is that the revolutionary army retreated in such a flustered or "embarrassed" manner, and the masses were so pessimistic and disappointed. These words coming from the mouth of a backbone member of the revolutionary masses are difficult to understand. According to this description, it gives the impression that the Red Army's northward march against Japan was a "scramble" under the close pursuit of the White Army, disregarding the masses without preparation. On the contrary, the White Army's entry into the Soviet area is described as "entering a no-man's land"! Coupled with the sad and mournful tone of the masses seeing off the Red Guards, this atmosphere is even more prominent, and this description is not in line with historical truth.

The panic and hesitation of the masses are not impossible to express under certain circumstances in the work, but as written in the original "Hongxia," it was by no means a general and widespread situation in the long-tempered old Soviet area, and therefore lost its typical significance.

The play writes that Hongxia pretends to lead the enemy in order to cover the masses, and the masses severely scold Hongxia, which seems to be a depiction of the revolutionary consciousness of the masses, but the effect is just the opposite, showing the "ignorance" of the masses. It is understandable that some of the masses misunderstand for a while, but it will never be the case that all the masses, including Qingshan, who knows Hongxia best, misunderstand unanimously, because we cannot forget that Hongxia agreed to lead the way when the enemy was about to kill all the masses. This description not only fails to realistically express the relationship between Hongxia and the masses, but also belittles the image of the masses. The play does not see the strength of the masses, nor does it see the leading role of the Party. In the author's pen, the revolutionary masses become a group of lost sheep. Although the Red Army finally made a show of force, it seems to be just a "bright tail" and cannot change the overall impression given by the entire script regarding the Red Army's erroneous perception. The author seems to only focus on bizarre plots and startling conflicts, and has not paid attention to these fundamental issues.

Secondly, let's talk about the description of Hongxia in the original work.

In order to strengthen the "drama," the author uses "honey trap" as the central plot. Hongxia, on the way to pretending to lead the enemy, uses the bandit leader Bai Wude's despicable intentions towards her to intoxicate the enemy with sensuality and rescue her captured lover, Zhao Zhigang. This arrangement and description seriously damages the image of a pure and brave heroic girl. When she is pouring wine for the enemy, she sings such a long "ode" to the reactionaries: "A cup of fine wine is poured full, you enjoy wealth in the world. A second cup of fine wine is poured again, you get promoted and make a fortune and your prestige shakes the four directions. Three cups of fine wine go into your stomach, you have more land, more houses, more grain in the granary. If you have wine, you should drink it, if you have fun, you should enjoy it. Four cups of wine, you have herds of mules and horses, and pens full of pigs and sheep. Five cups of wine, you have three wives and four concubines and servants filling the hall..." No matter how good the author's motives are, the gains and losses of such words coming from the mouth of a revolutionary girl are very clear.

What is most unbearable is that when the White bandit leader teases Hongxia, the author deliberately puts Hongxia's lover, Red Guard captain Zhao Zhigang, in front of her, developing the plot from the "triangular" entanglement of the three people. Even in order to set off the enemy's ugly and shameless soul, even the small hotel in the old Soviet area mountains is stiffly plastered with the couplet "One should enjoy life to the fullest when one is successful, and never leave the golden cup empty to the moon." It is difficult to understand, is the drama only in need of lively plots!

The original work also has some heroic lyrics, but throughout the whole work, it often inappropriately exaggerates and renders the negative emotions of the characters in order to write "detailed" emotions. All the parts that write about the parting of relatives and the revolutionary martyrs going to their deaths reveal a gray, lingering sentiment, which coats the revolutionary image of bravely fighting for the cause of human liberation or regarding death as home with a layer of gray. In the film, in the middle of a long song of Hongxia's nostalgia for life and yearning for the light before her sacrifice, a close-up shot is used to make Hongxia pick a wild flower on the mountain and put it on her temple, which is extremely beautiful, but extremely false. It is neither in line with the life situation nor does it help to express the image. According to the needs of the image, adding a concentrated expression will make the image more prominent, richer, and more typical; conversely, it often damages the image. The distinction between the communist spirit and the petty-bourgeois and bourgeois thoughts and feelings is very clear. If the original "Hongxia" has defects, I think what I have talked about above are fundamental defects.

Although the film adaptation of "Hongxia" basically puts the opera on the screen, it has made great improvements in showing the strength of the masses, which is more in line with the historical face. The "honey trap" plot has been diluted a lot, but unfortunately, the original color of this plot in the opera is still retained; in particular, the scene where Zhao Zhigang appears in the same scene when Hongxia is teased, that is, when Hongxia uses her tricks against the enemy, is also retained.

The Kunqu opera "Hongxia" has made a greater degree of adaptation to the original work. This is manifested in the fact that the above-mentioned defects have been carefully deleted and compensated one by one, completely erasing the traces of the "honey trap," protecting the integrity of the character image, and making Hongxia more rationally and reasonably defeat the enemy. There are many wonderful descriptions of the Party's leading role, the strength of the masses, and the relationship between the characters. For example, the description of the revolutionary masses and the scenes of life when the Red Army marched north against Japan and withdrew from the Jiangxi Soviet area has been greatly changed compared with the original. The masses depicted here are not peaceful and happy without any concept of the enemy's situation, nor are they sudden panic and hesitation, but rather focus on reflecting the character characteristics of the people in the Soviet area and the Party's leading role. Qingshan's appearance has been changed to such lyrics:

Qingshan: The war artillery fire is roaring, the White bandits are going to be fierce again, quickly evacuate and strengthen the walls and clear the fields, don't leave half a grain for the enemy!
Xiaohu: Folks, the chairman of the district Soviet orders, immediately strengthen the walls and clear the fields, hide all the grain, tear down the bridge, cut down the trees, block the road, cut off the trails, the enemy is coming soon, hurry up and take action! ….

Let's take another example: When a security brigade deputy in the adaptation added a cruel means to investigate Hongxia among the masses, no one was willing to reveal it. However, when the masses suffered because of this, Hongxia bravely stood up. At this time, the enemy thought they had gained something, suddenly another girl stood up and shouted: "I am Hongxia!" The enemy was still in shock, suddenly one, two, three... girls stood up and shouted: "I am Hongxia! I am Hongxia!" It's really thrilling! The communist style of the revolutionary masses is perfectly expressed here. But the enemy finally recognized Hongxia, and because of the above description, it also set off the enemy's cruelty and cunning. The adaptation pays special attention to the depiction of the character image and the character relationship, and strives to make the plot reasonable. What is especially valuable is that it correctly expresses the positive image, expresses their growth and development, and makes their new ideological qualities always shine with the light of communism from the depths of their hearts in the struggle. Thus, it produced a great encouragement and educational force.

The Kunqu opera adaptation completely deleted the love relationship between Hongxia and Zhao Zhigang and processed it into a simple relationship between Party comrades. It is a very clever and brilliant method to embody the Party's leadership through Zhao Zhigang. It is not that the love life plot of revolutionary heroes cannot be described, the problem is whether it is necessary for shaping the image and expressing the theme. The original opera used a large amount of space to render the love relationship between Hongxia and Zhao Zhigang. Due to improper handling, it makes people feel that the main component of Hongxia's heroic behavior is out of love for her children. Since the original work treated Hongxia's ideological consciousness quite low at the beginning, and the leading force of the Party lacked correct expression, especially from lyrics such as "To pick the flowers of happiness and freedom, Zhigang can open the way, I would rather lose my life for him, the affection will never be moved", it is no wonder that the audience has the above impression.

The adaptation work carried out by the Kunqu opera to the original work is actually a re-creation process. It has made great efforts in correctly expressing the Party's leading role and the spiritual outlook of the masses, thereby relatively completely expressing the heroic image of Hongxia, who is wise, brave and unyielding. Undoubtedly, this is written higher, more ideal, and therefore more typical, more real, and more convincing. When we express revolutionary historical themes, even if the revolutionary forces are in extremely difficult circumstances, we should grasp the most essential things: to strengthen our own ambition and destroy the enemy's prestige. If this aspect is not fully expressed, it will be difficult to improve the ideological nature of the work.

The new achievement of "Hongxia" is not only in the work itself, but the most important thing is to provide a good example for the correct creative method. We very much hope that the opera version of "Hongxia" can learn from the Kunqu opera adaptation and improve it. In the early years, "The White-Haired Girl" also had some individual principled shortcomings in image shaping, and it also gradually matured in the continuous revision over the years.

In his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, Chairman Mao pointed out that "Life as reflected in works of literature and art can and ought to be on a higher plane, more intense, more concentrated, more typical, nearer the ideal, and therefore more universal, than actual everyday life. Revolutionary literature and art should create a variety of characters out of real life and help the masses to advance history...." These instructions, it should be said, are the most familiar to us, but our understanding is not deep enough. In fact, this is a brilliant exposition of the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. It is very harmful to the development of creation to separate revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism are different, but they are unified, flesh and blood related, and blended as a whole. It is based on real life and takes the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint to "observe, experience, study, analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, and all original materials of literature and art," truthfully reflecting life and struggle and must be higher and more ideal than ordinary actual life. Revolutionary romanticism cannot be separated from the basis of truthfully reflecting life and struggle; and revolutionary realism is bound to be closely linked with revolutionary romanticism, and even contains the elements of revolutionary romanticism. Without raising life and characters higher, more typical, and more ideal on the basis of real life, it cannot be regarded as a work of revolutionary realism. We have always opposed the tendency to stick to the details of real life and fall into short-sighted naturalism. Let our artistic generalization ability and artistic imagination fly higher and higher; but the most basic thing is still the reality of life. It is impossible to stand firm on this foothold first. Empty talk about revolutionary romanticism will turn into daydreaming. The unity of the truth of life and the truth of art is precisely the concrete embodiment of the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Describing revolutionary historical themes also requires truthfully and centrally reflecting the revolutionary real life, and fully expressing the lofty and far-reaching communist ideals and style, and creating the most real, highest, and most typical artistic images. The creation and re-creation of "Hongxia", between gains and losses, has given us great enlightenment.

    正确创造艺术形象
    ——评“红霞”创造和再创造的得失
    马少波
    我国文学艺术有着现实主义和浪漫主义相结合的创作传统。战斗现实主义和积极浪漫主义的结合，使历代不少文艺作品放射不朽的光芒。在今天大跃进的时代，我们需要更加认真地继承和发扬这个传统。毛主席指出我们的文学艺术的创作方法应当是革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义的结合，正如周扬同志所说的，“这是对全部文学历史的科学概括，是根据当前时代的特点和需要而提出来的一项十分正确的主张，应当成为我们全体文艺工作者共同奋斗的方向。”
    优秀作品中的艺术形象之所以富有感人的力量，往往是由于正确运用了革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的方法，使人物真实而生动，达到突出和充实的程度和更高的精神境界。作到这一点，必须从人物的思想、性格、生活的真实性出发，必须确切掌握人物生活环境的特点，来进行艺术的构思，发挥艺术的想像。革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法和作家世界观不是没有关系的，甚至还不是一般的关系。后者乃是前者的基础。
    我先后看了“红霞”的很多不同剧种的演出；同时也读了歌剧原作和电影、昆剧的改编本，感到改作有很大的丰富和发展。这是叫人非常高兴的事。因此，我想就这个戏的发展，探索一下其中的得失。
    “红霞”描写的是二十多年前江西老革命根据地一个名叫红霞的农村姑娘和国民党反动派英勇斗争的故事。是当前最流行的剧目之一。歌剧原作的故事构思和音乐创作，还是有一定成就的。作者根据一些有关的片断的传说进行了艺术的概括。这些传说是富有光彩的。这一点和“白毛女”原来的传说十分类似。用它作为创作素材，是可以大大地驰骋想像力来反映一个革命时期的时代面貌和人民的英勇斗争的。我想，作者的创作意图正是这样。
    一部好的艺术作品，往往取决于表现生活矛盾的深度，因为作到这点，才可能产生激动人心的力量；但是为了表现生活矛盾的深度而事件的发展和性格之间的冲突，必须放置于现实生活的基础之上，使它更突出，更尖锐，也就愈能显示斗争的复杂性。因为有了这个坚实可靠的基础，艺术构思作到尽情合理，想像的翅膀飞的愈高，在观众中愈能产生信任和说服力。这样才能达到教育观众的目的。
    “红霞”原作对这一根本问题的注意是不够的。作者着重地渲染离奇惊险的情节，只顾把人物放在尖锐的冲突之中，追求一些表面的效果，而相当忽略了生活的现实性和人物形象典型性的描写，因而使人感到生活和人物不应有的肤浅和虚假，大大损伤了人物形象，降低了作品的思想性。原作写党、写红军、写革命群众以至反面人物都有简单化和格调低下的缺陷。
    例如所描写的白色恐怖的严重，这的确是历史生活的真实，而且也是作品中所必须反映的一面；但这仅仅是一个方面，无论在历史生活和作品中都不是主要的压倒的一面。在一个时间内，敌人侵入苏区在力量上是具有极大的优势，人民因而遭受残酷的迫害，但是主导的方面是革命的人民长期地进行英勇的对敌斗争来迎接本身的解放。写老根据地的斗争，如果不充分写出人民群众在劣势的情况下，压倒敌人的精神力量，那就很难反映出历史的真实面貌。
    原作一开始把群众放在一个相当太平麻痹的情境，突然又把他们推入惊慌悲惨的深渊，我们引一段村干部青山的唱词看：“大火烧来啦，乡亲们噢！灾难要来罗，孩子们噢！是我老眼昏花？还是恶梦一场？今早五更天，我上前线去送粮，半路上遇红军纷纷向后方，白军炮火追，烟雾盖村庄，乡亲们泪满面，人心乱慌慌，你听这炮声步步紧，你看这赤卫队已回到村头上。南方的白军正猖狂，日本鬼子又打进北方，莫非世道要大变哪？啊！只觉得天地在动荡。”
    这样的唱词，还不是个别的。作者所描写的红军北上抗日的典型环境，就是革命军队如此慌张或者说“狼狈”地败退，群众又如此悲观失望。这些话出自一个革命群众的骨干分子之口，是叫人难以理解的。按照这种描写，给人的感觉却好像是红军北上抗日，是在白军紧紧进逼下毫无准备地置群众于不顾的“逃窜”，相反，把白军进入苏区反而描写成“如入无人之境”！加以群众为赤卫军送行的那种悲悲切切的调子，这种气氛就更加突出了，这种描写是不符合历史真实的。
    群众的惊慌徬徨，在作品中的一定情况下，不是不可以表现的，但是像“红霞”原作所写的那样，在久经锻炼的老苏区，决不是一般的带有普遍性的情况，因而失掉了典型意义。
    剧中写到红霞为了掩蔽群众假意为敌人带路，群众把红霞痛加责骂，好像是描写了群众的革命觉悟，而效果恰恰相反，表现的是群众的“愚昧无知”。有的群众一时发生误解，这是可以理解的，但绝不会是全体群众包括最了解红霞的青山在内，一致发生误解，因为我们不能忘记红霞是在敌人要把群众统统杀害的情况下答应带路的。这种描写不仅没有真实地表现红霞和群众的关系，而且贬低了群众的形象。剧中看不到群众的力量，也看不到党的领导作用，革命群众在作者笔下变成了一群迷途的羔羊。最后虽然让红军壮了一下声势，看来只是一条“光明的尾巴”，并不能改变整个剧本所给人的对于红军的错觉。作者似乎只抓住离奇的情节和惊人的冲突，没有注意到这些根本性的问题。
    其次，谈谈原作对于红霞这个人物的描写。
    作者为了加强“戏剧性”，用“美人计”作为中心情节。使红霞在假意为敌人带路的途中，利用匪首白五德对她的卑鄙念头，用色情来灌醉敌人，救出被捕的她的爱人赵志刚。这种情节的安排和描写，严重损害了一个纯洁的勇敢的英雄少女的形象。在她向敌人灌酒的时候，竟然唱出这样一大段对于反动派的“颂歌”：“一杯美酒倒满杯，你在人间享富贵。二杯美酒再斟上，你升官发财威振四方。三杯美酒进肚肠，你地多房多粮食满仓。有酒就该喝，有乐就该享。四杯酒啊，你骡马成群满圈猪羊。五杯酒，你三妻四妾佣人满堂。……”无论作者的动机多么良好，这样的话出于一个革命少女之口，得失是很清楚的了。
    最使人不能忍受的，是作者当白匪首调戏红霞时，特意把红霞的爱人、赤卫队长赵志刚放在面前，从三个人的“三角”纠葛来发展剧情。甚至为了衬托敌人丑恶无耻的灵魂，连老苏区山中的小酒店也生硬地贴上“人生得意须尽欢，莫使金樽空对月”的对联。使人很难理解，难道戏剧只是需要热闹的情节么！
    原作中对于主要的反面人物白匪大队长白五德也有不真实的描写。表现正面形象，突出主题思想，不能不用很大的努力来刻划反面人物的典型。只有当反面人物愈典型化，愈真实而生动，就愈能烘托正面人物的鲜明的性格，愈能显示生活中间矛盾冲突的复杂性和尖锐性。白五德的描写可能是受了“美人计”的限制，姑无论在如此紧迫的军事行动中醉酒取乐是否可能；只是把一个主要的反面人物写成像“望江亭”中的杨衙内那样的中计，那样轻易地中计，就是很不真实的。
    原作虽也写出了一些豪壮的唱词，但通篇看来，却往往为了写出“细致”的感情，而不恰当地夸大渲染人物的消极情绪，凡是写亲人惜别和革命者就义的部分，都流露出一种灰溜溜缠绵绵的情调，这给为了人类解放事业英勇奋斗或者视死如归的革命形象，涂了一层灰色。影片还在红霞牺牲前一大段对人生留恋感慨和对光明的想望的歌唱中间，以特写镜头，使红霞“闲庭信步”似的在山头采拾一朵山花插上鬓边，美则极美了，但是极其虚假，它既不符合生活情境，也无助于表现形象。根据形象需要，加以集中表现，就会使形象更突出、更充实、更有典型性；反之，则往往使形象受到损害，共产主义的精神和小资产阶级、资产阶级的思想感情，其区别是至为明显的。如果说“红霞”原作有缺陷，我认为以上谈的是根本性的缺陷。
    “红霞”的电影改编本，虽然基本上是把歌剧搬上了银幕，但对表现群众的力量，却有了很大的弥补，比较符合历史面貌。“美人计”的情节冲淡了好多，但可惜仍然保留了歌剧这一情节的原有色调；特别是当红霞被戏侮也就是红霞对敌人用计的时候使赵志刚同场出现的情节，也被保留下来了。
    “红霞”的昆剧对原作进行了较大程度的改编。这表现在对于上述缺陷都一一地精心地加以删除和弥补，完全抹掉了“美人计”的痕迹，保护了人物形象的完整，而又使红霞较入情合理地战胜了敌人。对于党的领导作用，对于群众的力量，对于人物之间的关系都有不少精彩的描写。例如对于红军北上抗日撤离江西苏区时的革命群众和生活场景的描写，比原作大为改观。这里描写的群众不是毫无敌情观念的太平欢乐，也不是突如其来的惊慌和徬徨，乃是着重反映了苏区人民的性格特征和党的领导作用。青山上场改成了这样的唱词：
    青山：战争炮火轰隆响，白匪又要逞凶狂，坚壁清野
          快疏散，不给敌人留下半颗粮！
    小虎：乡亲们，区苏维埃主席命令，马上坚壁清野，
          把粮食都藏起来，把桥拆掉，把树砍倒，拦住
          大路，切断小道，敌人快要到了，赶快行动起
          来吧！……。
    再举一个例子来说吧：当改编本加写进去的一个保安大队副以残酷的手段在群众中追查红霞的时候，群众谁也不肯吐露。可是当群众因此遭难的时候，红霞勇敢地站了出来。这时，敌人以为有所得了，突然又有一个姑娘站出来喊：“我是红霞！”敌人惊悸未定，突然又有一个、两个、三个……姑娘站出来喊：“我是红霞！我是红霞！”真是惊心动魄啊！革命群众的共产主义风格在这里得到了极其完美的表现。但是敌人终于认出红霞来了，由于上面的描写，也就反衬出敌人的凶残和狡猾。改编本异常注重人物形象和人物关系的刻划，努力使情节入情合理，尤其可贵的是正确地表现了正面形象，表现出他们的成长和发展，并在斗争中使他们的新的思想品质始终从人物的内心闪耀着共产主义的光芒。从而产生了极大的鼓舞和教育的力量。
    昆剧改编本彻底删掉了红霞和赵志刚的爱情关系，处理成单纯的党的同志关系，通过赵志刚来体现党的领导是很聪明绝妙的作法。本来对革命英雄人物是未尝不可以描写她的爱情生活情节的，问题是在于对塑造形象和表达主题思想有无必要。歌剧原作以很大篇幅渲染红霞和赵志刚的爱情关系，由于处理不当，使人感觉红霞的英雄行为的主要成分是出于儿女之情。由于原作在开始的时候把红霞的思想觉悟处理得相当低下，党的领导力量又缺乏正确表现，特别是从诸如“要采幸福自由花，志刚能把路打通，我为他宁可丢性命，情意永世搬不动”等唱词看来，观众产生如上的印象，也就无怪其然了。
    昆剧改编本对原作所进行的改编工作，实际上是一个再创作的过程。它在正确表现党的领导作用和群众的精神面貌上，尽了很大的努力，从而比较完整地表现了红霞这一智勇不屈的英雄形象。无疑这是写得更高、更理想了，因而也是更典型、更真实、更令人信服。我们表现革命历史题材，即使革命力量在极困难的情况下，也应该把握最本质的东西：长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风。这方面表现得不充分，作品的思想性就很难提高。
    “红霞”的新成就不仅在作品本身，而最重要的，是为正确的创作方法提供了良好的例子。我们很希望“红霞”的歌剧本能够从昆剧改编本有所借鉴加以改进。早年，“白毛女”在形象塑造上也曾存在过个别带有原则性的缺点，它也是在多年来不断地修磨中逐步成熟起来的。
    毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中，指出“文艺作品中反映出来的生活却可以而且应该比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性。革命的文艺，应当根据实际生活创造出各种各样的人物来，帮助群众推动历史的前进。……”这些指示，应该说是我们最熟悉的了，但我们的体会并不是深刻的。其实这就是对于革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的精辟阐述。值得我们更深刻地去体会它的精神实质。把革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义割裂开来，对于创作的发展是十分有害的。革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义是有区别的，而又是统一的、血肉关联、水乳交融的整体，是在现实生活的基础上以马克思列宁主义的观点“去观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料”，真实地反映生活斗争并且必须比普通的实际生活更高，更理想。革命浪漫主义不能离开真实地反映生活斗争的基础；而革命现实主义必然和革命浪漫主义紧密相连，甚至包含革命浪漫主义的成分。没有在现实生活基础上把生活和人物提得更高、更典型、更理想，也就不成其为革命现实主义的作品。我们从来是反对拘泥于现实生活细节流入鼠目寸光的自然主义的倾向的，让我们的艺术概括能力和艺术的想像飞得更高更高吧；但是最基本的还是生活的现实。不首先站稳这个立脚点，是不行的。空谈革命浪漫主义，会变成想入非非。生活的真实和艺术的真实的统一性，正是革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法的具体体现。描写革命的历史题材，同样要求真实地集中地反映出革命的现实生活，并且充分表现出崇高远大的共产主义理想和风格，创造出最真实、最高、最典型的艺术形象。“红霞”的创造和再创造，得失之间，使我们从而得到很大的启示。
