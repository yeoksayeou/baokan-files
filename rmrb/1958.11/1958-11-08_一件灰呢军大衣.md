    A Gray Wool Military Overcoat
    Worker at Beijing Xingping Machinery Factory, Chu Yanzhang

    I have a gray wool military overcoat at home. I have cherished and kept it for thirteen years.

    Seeing this military overcoat, I think of a person. A Soviet Red Army soldier. Unfortunately, I don't know his name, and of course, I don't know where he is now. I can only look towards the red stars twinkling in Moscow and silently offer him my blessings.

    In August 1945, one midnight, Soviet Red Army bomber groups flew to the Northeast. In a moment, there were earth-shattering explosions. The city of Dong'an (now Mishan), the capital of the Japanese-puppet Dong'an Province, was a sea of fire. The surrounding Japanese barracks and fortifications were completely destroyed.

    The bombing continued until dawn. The sounds of artillery fire from the east and south grew louder and closer. The Japanese devils were in full retreat, fleeing for their lives. At dawn, the Soviet Red Army mechanized units arrived! The villagers surrounded them, as if meeting long-separated relatives, cheering, shaking hands, and tears gushing like springs. The devils were finished this time! Fourteen years! How much suffering and torment we had endured! This year, we finally made it to the end!

    Our village people were all relocated here by the Japanese devils to reclaim wasteland. We were starving and freezing, and hardly a day went by without two or three people being carried out dead. At this time, everyone went to the empty battlefields and barracks to pick up things. People called this "foreign scavenging." My older brother had already gone for two days, and I was the only one left at home. I was only ten years old, with nothing to eat or wear. I decided to go find him, maybe I could pick up some "foreign scavenging" as well.

    From our village to the east, all the way to the Ussuri River, there were more than two hundred miles without any inhabitants. I set out in the morning. After walking for a while, I tripped over something. I got up and saw, ah, a dead Japanese devil lying on the ground, his eyes wide open, his face bulging in patches, his head swollen to a large size, covered with green bottle flies. I was scared, and ran away. Then there were several of the same dead fellows blocking my way, so I had to run to the side. I ran and shouted, until it got dark, exhausted, without seeing a single person. My body was covered in blood, my feet were pricked in several places and still bleeding, my already tattered clothes were torn into strips, and I didn't know where I lost the pair of broken shoes I was wearing.

    Suddenly, the rumble of an engine came from afar, and a light shone over. It was a car, and it stopped. A Soviet driver wearing leather boots came over and asked me many questions in surprise, but I didn't understand a word. I just pointed west, repeatedly shouting the name of our village, "Banshi Chang, Banshi Chang." He understood. He picked me up and put me in the car, found iodine to rub on my wounds, and took out bread and sausage for me to eat. He touched my head and said some words that seemed to be affectionate and reproachful. It was the first time I had ever eaten bread and sausage. While I was eating, I looked at him. He was tall, only in his twenties. It felt like I was sitting next to my older brother.

    The car finally found my home with difficulty. He took me down, and seeing me shivering from the cold, he took off his overcoat and put it on me. I stared blankly at him, not knowing what to say. But he smiled and lifted me up high and then gently put me down, tightly holding my little hand and saying, "Harasho" (good), "Dosvidanya" (goodbye). I also learned to repeat those two words of his. The car finally drove away, the red taillights flashing, gradually disappearing into the vast plain.

    It was a brand new gray wool military overcoat, with several iron buttons on it. The buttons had a golden five-pointed star, with a red hammer and sickle in the center. Its shining light still shines brightly in my heart.

    Thirteen years have passed, and tremendous changes have taken place in my hometown. The original Beidahuang, overgrown with shrubs and weeds and infested with wolves, is now the largest farm in the country, the granary of the motherland. The poor children who used to herd pigs and cattle, like us, are now defenders and builders of the motherland.

    I have almost completely forgotten everything from my childhood, but only this event is firmly etched in my mind.

    一件灰呢军大衣
    北京兴平机械厂工人　褚彦章
    我家里有一件灰呢军大衣。我珍贵地保存它已经有十三个年头了。
    看到这件军大衣，我就想起一个人。一位苏联红军战士，可惜我不知道他的姓名，当然更不知道如今他在哪里，我只能遥向着莫斯科红星闪烁的地方，默默地为他祝福。
    1945年8月里一个午夜，苏联红军的轰炸机群飞到东北来了，片刻传来了惊天动地的巨响，伪东安省城东安市（现在的密山）一片火海，周围的日本兵营和工事全部毁了。
    轰炸一直到天亮。东面和南面炮声隆隆，越来越近。日本鬼子全线溃退逃命。天亮时候，苏联红军机械化部队就开过来了！老乡们把他们围住，像见到久别的亲人一样，又欢呼，又握手，热泪像泉水一样涌出来。这一下鬼子可完蛋了！十四年哪！我们受了多少苦难折磨！今年总算熬到头了！
    我们村的人都是被迁来给日本鬼子垦荒的，饥寒交迫，哪天没有三个两个死人向外抬？这时候，都到空荡荡的战场上和兵营中去捡东西。大家管这叫“洋捞”。我哥哥已经去了两天，家里只剩下我一个，我才十岁，没吃没穿的。我决定去接他，说不定顺便也能捡上一点什么“洋捞”呢。
    由我们村往东，直到乌苏里江边，二百多里没有人烟。早晨我就上了路。走了一阵，被什么东西拌了我一跤。爬起来一看，啊，一个死日本鬼子躺在地上，眼睛瞪得圆溜溜地，脸一块块凸起来，脑袋发涨得老大，混身落满了绿头苍蝇。我害怕了，拔腿就跑，前边又有几个同样的死家伙挡住了去路，只得向旁边跑去。我一面跑，一面叫，直到天黑，精疲力尽，没见一个人。我身上到处是血迹，脚扎了几个口子还冒血，本来就很破的裤褂被撕得一条条的，脚上那双破鞋也不知道丢在哪里了。
    突然，隆隆的马达声由远而近，一道灯光照射过来，是一辆汽车，停下了。一个穿皮靴的苏联司机走过来，惊奇地问了我好多话，我一句也不懂。我只是手指西边，一边连声喊着我们村的名字“板石场，板石场”。他明白了。他把我抱上了车，找出红药水往我的伤处擦，又拿出面包和香肠给我吃。他摸着我的头，说了些似乎是爱抚和埋怨的话。面包香肠我还是第一次吃哩。我一面吃，一面打量他。他高高个子，不过二十多岁，我仿佛就坐在哥哥身边。
    汽车好容易找到了我的家。他把我抱下来，看见我冷得发抖，顺手把他的大衣脱下来披在我身上。我呆呆的望着他，不知说些什么才好。他却笑嘻嘻地将我高高举起又轻轻放下，紧握着我的小手说：“合老少”（好），“道斯维达臬”。（再见）我也学着重复地说他那两句话。汽车终于开走了，后边的红灯一闪一闪地，渐渐消失在茫茫的大平原上。
    那是一件崭新的灰呢子军大衣，上面有几个铁质钮扣，钮扣上有金色五角星，中间有着红色锤子和镰刀。它那闪闪的光，直到现在，还在我心头发亮。
    十三年过去了，家乡起了巨大的变化。原来灌木杂草丛生、野狼成群的北大荒，现在成了全国最大的农场，成了祖国的谷仓。原来我们这伙放猪放牛的穷苦孩子，现在都成了祖国的保卫者和建设者了。
    童年时期的一切，现在差不多忘得一干二净了，只有这件事情牢牢地刻在我的心头上。
