Mobilize the Masses to Explore the Treasure House of Traditional Chinese Medicine
Hebei Province Achieves Remarkable Success in Ten Major Campaigns to Promote Traditional Chinese Medicine

(Our report) Reporter Sun Zunian reports: In order to promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, Hebei Province has earnestly implemented the Party's policies on traditional Chinese medicine and has achieved remarkable results over the past four years.

Since 1954, a series of mass movements have been carried out throughout the province, including visiting and seeking out talented individuals, promoting unity between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, encouraging Western medicine practitioners to study traditional Chinese medicine, advancing traditional Chinese medicine education, conducting research in traditional Chinese medicine, collecting folk remedies, and popularizing acupuncture. These movements have expanded traditional Chinese medicine institutions, universally established traditional Chinese medicine departments in medical units above the county level, and absorbed a large number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners into the workforce, thereby further leveraging the strength of traditional Chinese medicine and giving traditional Chinese medicine work a brand-new look.

Due to the implementation of the traditional Chinese medicine policy, the ideological awareness and work enthusiasm of the vast number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have been continuously improved. In the past, many diseases considered incurable by Western medicine were often treated effectively by traditional Chinese medicine. Many diseases that required surgical operations could be cured with internal Chinese medicine or acupuncture. Many chronic diseases could be cured without medication through acupuncture, qigong, or cupping. For example, traditional Chinese medicine can treat arterial embolism without amputation, intestinal obstruction without surgery, and appendicitis without incision. Observation of one thousand cases of appendicitis treated with emergency powder showed a 100% cure rate. After traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Sheng Zizhang contributed his secret formula for treating syphilis, the disease was essentially eliminated within a few months. With the active role played by traditional Chinese medicine, its social status has also greatly improved. Not only have 1,868 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners been elected as people's representatives and CPPCC members at all levels throughout the province, but more and more people have come to understand traditional Chinese medicine. Most people have changed their previous views, actively studied traditional Chinese medicine, and even the opposition faction among bourgeois intellectuals has had to bow their heads and admit defeat in the face of irrefutable facts.

Why has Hebei Province achieved such great success in implementing the Party's policies on traditional Chinese medicine? The fundamental reason is that it relied on the masses to mobilize the masses, resulting in a magnificent ten major campaigns for traditional Chinese medicine work throughout the province. The specific content of the ten major campaigns is as follows:

Learning Traditional Chinese Medicine Policy
After the Party Central Committee issued instructions on improving traditional Chinese medicine work in 1954, the provincial health administration meeting conveyed them. In 1955, a massive movement was launched among medical and health personnel throughout the province to study the Party's policies on traditional Chinese medicine work. Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, this movement focused on criticizing the ideas of He Cheng and rightist Wang Bin, who belittled, discriminated against, and excluded traditional Chinese medicine, and carried out an ideological struggle between two lines among all medical and health personnel. This struggle thoroughly exposed various bourgeois ideas that belittled, discriminated against, attacked, and excluded traditional Chinese medicine. Irreconcilable struggles were waged against these erroneous ideas, and typical people and events were seized upon for in-depth criticism. Cadres in health departments at all levels also universally conducted ideological self-examinations from top to bottom. At the same time, representative meetings of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were convened at each level to solicit opinions. Many Party and government leaders in counties and cities personally visited traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and included the implementation of the Party's policies on traditional Chinese medicine work in the government's work plan. These movements greatly undermined the bourgeois ideology of excluding traditional Chinese medicine, and further improved the ideological and policy levels of all health personnel. The health administration department also formulated specific measures to unite traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, organized Western medicine practitioners to study traditional Chinese medicine, established traditional Chinese medicine institutions, and made reasonable deployments for traditional Chinese medicine business, with unified arrangements. Under the influence of the health system's study of traditional Chinese medicine policies, cadres in political and legal affairs, taxation, and supply and marketing departments also automatically examined phenomena in the past that were inconsistent with traditional Chinese medicine policies when dealing with problems. The vast number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were greatly moved, and they went everywhere to tell each other, "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can traditional Chinese medicine have a bright future." Those who did not dare to take apprentices in the past took apprentices again, and those who did not dare to practice traditional Chinese medicine resumed their practice and actively participated in various health care work.

Great Unity of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine
In order to further strengthen the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, the province launched a great unity movement of traditional Chinese and Western medicine among health personnel in 1956. All levels of specialized, municipal, county, and district authorities throughout the province convened such meetings of great unity between traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Since then, traditional Chinese and Western medicine have not only strengthened their political unity but have also promoted the development of technical cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Since 1956, joint consultations and treatments by traditional Chinese and Western medicine have significantly increased. The Chengguan Clinic and Health Station in Xingtang County and 18 other units, with 140 traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, established a system of joint consultations by traditional Chinese and Western medicine every three days to jointly study difficult and complicated diseases. In the treatment of epidemic encephalitis B, traditional Chinese and Western medicine in counties such as Pingquan, Mengcun, and Qinglong, with traditional Chinese medicine as the main treatment and Western medicine as the auxiliary treatment, achieved a cure rate of 100%. According to statistics from four districts in Zhangbei County, 23 difficult and complicated patients were cured through joint consultations by traditional Chinese and Western medicine. A patient with measles complicated by pneumonia in the 9th district was in critical condition and was cured through joint diagnosis and treatment by traditional Chinese and Western medicine. The patient's mother gratefully said, "Only under the leadership of the People's Government can traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners see patients together. The doctors are truly serving the people. We have never seen such a thing in the old society!"

Visiting and Seeking Out Talented Individuals
The movement to visit and seek out talented individuals began with the province organizing a "Visiting Traditional Chinese Medicine Work Group" to conduct visits and seek out talented individuals, and later developed to the specialized, municipal, county, and township levels. Among the 784 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners visited by the provincial visiting traditional Chinese medicine work group alone, 257 secret formulas and 57 medical works were contributed. Some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners even wrote poems for this visit, such as: "Traditional Chinese medicine in the old society was at the end of its rope, and traditional Chinese medicine in the new society has a bright future. The Communist Party's kindness will never be forgotten, and we vow to inherit and promote the medicine of our motherland." "A strong country seeks talent, and Chairman has a great mind. If traditional Chinese medicine does not work hard, when will it!" During the visits to seek out talented individuals, many traditional Chinese medicine talents were also discovered. For example, Hao Dexin from the provincial traditional Chinese medicine clinic, who can treat myopia; Men Zhaoyi, who cured Hodgkin's disease with three doses of traditional Chinese medicine; Qian Qiguang from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute, who treats cirrhosis; and Liu Jiesan from the Baoding Special District Hospital, who is good at treating deafness and muteness, are all traditional Chinese medicine practitioners with excellent skills who were discovered during the movement to visit and seek out talented individuals. After these people participated in national medical work, they not only further exerted their strength but also brought more favorable conditions for inheriting and promoting the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine.

National Folk Remedy Collection
Since the implementation of the traditional Chinese medicine policy, all parts of the province have paid attention to verified prescriptions and folk remedies, and have collected more than 10,000 single prescriptions. Starting in October of this year, a national folk remedy collection movement has been launched throughout the province, and this movement is currently being widely carried out. According to incomplete statistics at the end of October, 162,000 pieces of single prescriptions and folk remedies have been collected. These single prescriptions cover a wide range of treatments, and most of them can adapt to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. Among the 1,790 prescriptions collected in Hejian County in three days, preliminary review showed that 1,092 were economical and effective. In Xiaohuangjia Village in the county, an elderly woman in her sixties has a special effect in treating stubborn tinea with flint cutting. She has personally cured more than 600 patients with stubborn tinea. An elderly farmer in his seventies in Cangxian Special District contributed a special effect formula that he had used for more than 40 years to treat stubborn dermatitis. Recently, this method was used to treat a cadre of the Cangxian Prefectural Office who suffered from systemic dermatitis. The cadre had been suffering from the disease for two or three years and had been treated in several large hospitals in Beijing without success. With this old farmer's treatment method, he was completely cured in less than a month. In the folk of Baoding Special District, a method of treating influenza with acupuncture and moxibustion was also discovered. From these facts, it is very necessary to launch a national folk remedy collection movement and actively rescue this precious cultural heritage of the motherland.

Run Traditional Chinese Medicine Education on a Large Scale
Running traditional Chinese medicine education on a large scale is an important task for inheriting and promoting the medicine of our motherland, expanding the ranks of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and developing our country's health cause. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine education in Hebei Province has developed on the basis of taking on apprentices. Especially after rectification and the Great Leap Forward, a movement to run traditional Chinese medicine education on a large scale quickly swept the province.

Western Medicine Practitioners Studying Traditional Chinese Medicine
The movement for Western medicine practitioners to study traditional Chinese medicine entered a climax in 1956. The learning methods are: spare time self-study, worshiping traditional Chinese medicine practitioners as teachers, accompanying traditional Chinese medicine practitioners on rounds, attending spare time traditional Chinese medicine schools, listening to academic reports on traditional Chinese medicine, organizing joint consultations between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and establishing on-the-job and off-the-job classes for Western medicine practitioners to study traditional Chinese medicine. More than 12,000 Western medicine practitioners in the province were drawn into the tide of studying traditional Chinese medicine, and 1,395 Western medicine practitioners have learned two sets of skills and become doctors who combine traditional Chinese and Western medicine.

Engage in Traditional Chinese Medicine Research on a Large Scale
This year, in order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production, a movement to widely establish a traditional Chinese medicine research network was launched throughout the province. As of the end of September, 2,198 traditional Chinese medicine research organizations of various types have been established throughout the province, with 10,021 researchers, achieving the goal of having a traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute at the provincial level, a traditional Chinese Medicine Research Branch at the special district level, a traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute at the county level, and traditional Chinese Medicine researchers in people's communes and general hospitals. It is expected that by the end of the year, traditional Chinese medicine research institutions will be fully popularized in urban and rural areas throughout the province. These research institutions will achieve certain results in exploring and organizing traditional Chinese medical theory and clinical experience. In recent years, more than a dozen types of books, including Internal Medicine Collection 1, Surgery Collection 1, Gynecological Treatment Methods, Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment of Measles, Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment of Epidemic Encephalitis B, Medical Transmission Record, and Folk Verified Prescriptions, have been published and distributed more than 200,000 copies, circulating in various provinces in China and Southeast Asia, and are deeply welcomed by the medical community at home and abroad.

Traditional Chinese Medicine Review
There are more than 40,000 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Hebei Province. Only a few elderly people have theoretical knowledge and experience, and most people's theoretical knowledge and experience are still insufficient. Improving the theoretical and technical level of traditional Chinese medicine and enriching clinical experience is not only the requirement of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners but also the desire of the broad masses of people. Under the leadership of the Party committee, various localities have launched a movement to run amateur traditional Chinese medicine education on a large scale. According to recent statistics, there are already seven amateur traditional Chinese medicine universities in the province, with 432 students; 95 amateur traditional Chinese medicine schools, with 21,565 students; and 35 traditional Chinese medicine refresher schools, with 1,944 students. The Hebei Traditional Chinese Medicine College has also established a traditional Chinese medicine refresher department to train teachers. In the past year, through traditional Chinese medicine review, these students have completed courses such as "The Inner Canon of Medicine," "Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases," and "History of Chinese Medicine." Their theoretical and technical level has been greatly improved.

Popularize Acupuncture and Moxibustion
Acupuncture and moxibustion is an important part of traditional Chinese medicine, with the advantages of being economical, simple, highly effective, easy to understand, and easy to learn. In order to popularize acupuncture and moxibustion, the province has held acupuncture and moxibustion training classes, training more than 400 acupuncture and moxibustion teachers, with an average of two to three acupuncture and moxibustion teachers per county. Zhangjiakou Special District already has more than 154,900 doctors, cadres, and masses who have learned simple acupuncture and moxibustion, adding a strong new force to the health front.

Carry out Mass Drug Production and Acquisition
In the production of medicinal materials, a mass movement of "Catch up with Yunnan and Guizhou, Compete with Sichuan and Guangdong, Authentic medicinal materials grow in Hebei; Wild medicinal materials are cultivated at home, Birds, beasts, insects, and fish are domesticated" was also launched. The province has established dozens of medicinal material experimental farms in Anguo, Pingquan, Shanhaiguan and other places, and opened medicinal material technical schools. The area for cultivating medicinal materials this year has increased nearly three times compared with 1955. Twenty-seven authentic medicinal materials such as safflower, rehmannia, codonopsis, pinellia, and finger citron have all been successfully introduced. Twenty-five kinds of wild animal and plant medicinal materials such as astragalus, licorice, aristolochia, scorpions, and sparrows have also been successfully domesticated one after another and have begun to be cultivated and bred in large quantities. At the same time, a massive mountain exploration movement was launched throughout the province, surveying 4,088 large and small mountains such as Daqing Mountain, Du Mountain, and Xiaowutai Mountain, and discovering 42 kinds of medicinal materials such as wild angelica dahurica, lily, and sea lice that were previously believed not to be produced in Hebei. In terms of medicinal material supply, the province has established a network of supply points, and the vast number of pharmaceutical and commercial employees have been working day and night, traveling over mountains and rivers to deliver goods to the mountains, rural areas, and factories to meet the needs of the masses.

    发动群众发掘祖国医学宝库
    河北省开展中医工作十大运动成绩卓著
    本报讯　记者孙祖年报道：为了发扬祖国医学遗产，河北省认真贯彻了党的中医政策，四年来已经取得显著成就。
    从1954年以来，先后在全省范围内开展了访贤求贤、中西医团结、西医学习中医、中医教育、中医研究、采风、普及针灸等一系列的群众运动，发展了中医机构，普遍在县以上的医疗单位中建立了中医科，吸收广大中医参加了工作，从而进一步发挥了中医力量，使中医工作出现了崭新的面貌。
    由于中医政策的贯彻，广大中医的思想觉悟和工作积极性，得到了不断的提高。过去，在西医看来许多不能治的病，而中医治疗却往往有奇效，很多必须施用外科手术的病，可以用内服中药或针灸而治愈，很多长期慢性病，用针灸、气功、拔罐不药而愈。比如中医治疗动脉栓塞可以不用截肢，肠梗阻可以不动手术，盲肠炎可以不开刀，用急救散治疗盲肠炎，一千个病例的观察，痊愈率为100％；中医盛子章献出了治疗梅毒的秘方后，在几个月的时间内，就基本上消灭了梅毒病。随着中医作用的积极发挥，中医的社会地位也大大提高。全省不仅有一千八百六十八名中医被选为各级人民代表和政协委员，而且对中医了解的人越来越多，大多数的人改变了以往的看法，积极地学习祖国医学，甚至那些资产阶级知识分子中的反对派，也不得不在铁的事实面前低头服输。
    河北省为什么能在贯彻执行党的中医政策上取得如此巨大的成就呢？根本原因，是依靠群众发动群众，在全省范围内，掀起了规模壮阔的中医工作十大运动的结果。十大运动的具体内容是：
    学习中医政策
    1954年党中央发布了关于改进中医工作的指示后，全省卫生行政会议进行了传达；1955年又在全省医药卫生人员中，发起了一个声势浩大的运动，学习党对中医工作的政策。这次运动在省委的领导下，以批判贺诚同志、右派分子王斌的轻视、歧视、排斥中医思想为中心，在全体医药卫生人员中，开展一场两条道路的思想斗争。在这场斗争中彻底揭露了各种轻视、歧视、打击、排斥中医的资产阶级思想。并和这些错误思想，进行了不调和的斗争，抓住典型人典型事，深刻作了批判，各级卫生部门的干部，也自上而下的普遍联系自己进行思想检查。同时，逐级召开中医代表会，征求意见。不少县市党政领导同志亲自登门拜访中医，并且把贯彻党对中医工作的政策列入政府工作中。通过这些运动，使排斥中医的资产阶级思想受到很大打击，全体卫生人员的思想政策水平有了进一步的提高。卫生行政部门还订出了团结中医的具体措施，组织了西医学习中医，建立了中医机构，并对中医业务作了合理部署，统一安排。在卫生系统学习中医政策的影响下，政法、税务、供销部门的干部也自动的检查了过去处理问题不符合中医政策的现象。广大中医受到了很大感动，到处奔走相告“只有在共产党毛主席领导下，中医才有光明前途”，过去不敢带徒弟的又带了徒弟，不敢当中医的又恢复了业务，并积极参加了各项卫生保健工作。
    中西医大团结
    为了进一步加强中西医的团结合作，全省于1956年在卫生人员中，开展了一个中西医大团结运动。全省所有的专、市、县、区各级均召开了这种中西医大团结会议。从此，中西医不仅加强了政治上的团结，也推动了中西医技术合作的发展。1956年以来，中西医共同会诊，共同治疗有了显著的增多。行唐县城关诊所、保健站等十九个单位，一百四十名中西医，订立了每三天一次的中西医会诊制度，共同研究疑难病症。平泉、孟村、青龙等县中西医在治疗流行性乙型脑炎方面，以中医为主，西医配合，治愈率达百分之百。张北县四个区的统计，通过中西医会诊治疗，治愈二十三个疑难病人；九区一个麻疹合并肺炎的患者，病情十分危急，经中西医共同诊治痊愈。患者的母亲感激的说：“只有在人民政府的领导下，中西医才能在一起看病，医生真是为人民服务，旧社会根本没有见过这样的事啊”！
      访贤求贤
    访贤求贤运动，开始是由省组织“拜访中医工作团”进行访贤求贤，以后又发展到专、市、县、乡。仅经省拜访中医工作团访问的七百八十四名中医中，献出秘方二百五十七个，医学著作五十七部，有的中医还为此次访问写了诗，如：旧社会的中医日暮途穷，新社会的中医前途无量，共产党的恩情终生难忘，誓把祖国医学继承发扬”。“强国求贤才，主席大胸怀，中医不努力，更待何时哉！在访贤求贤中，还发现了好多中医人材，如省中医门诊部能治近视的郝德新，三剂中药治愈了何杰金氏病的门兆义以及中医研究院治疗肝硬变的钱祺光，保定专区医院善于治疗聋哑症的刘介三等技术很好的中医，都是在访贤求贤运动中发现的。这些人参加国家医疗工作后，不仅进一步发挥了他们的力量，也给继承和发扬祖国医学遗产带来了更多的有利条件。
        全民采风
    从贯彻中医政策以来，全省各地就注意了验方、土方，并收集到单方一万多个。今年10月份开始，又在全省掀起了全民采风运动，目前这个运动正广泛开展。根据10月底不完全统计，已收集到的单方、土方十六万二千件。这些单方治疗范围很广，大多数都能适应多快好省的方针。河间县三天收集起来的一千七百九十个方子，经初步审查，其中有一千零九十二件都是经济有效的。该县小黄家村，一位六十多岁的老太太，用燧石割治顽癣有特效，本人曾先后治愈过六百多名顽癣病人；沧县专区一位七十多岁的老农民，献出了一个用过四十多年的治疗顽固性皮炎的特效方，最近用这个方法治疗了沧县专署一位患全身性皮炎的干部，这个干部患病已二、三年之久，在北京几个大医院治疗无效，用这位老农的治法，不到一个月就完全治愈了。在保定专区民间，还发现有一种针灸治疗流行性感冒的方法。从这些事实来看，发动全民采风运动，积极抢救祖国这份宝贵的文化遗产，是十分必要的。
    大办中医教育
    大办中医教育，是继承发扬祖国医学，扩大中医队伍，发展我国卫生事业的一项重要任务。几年来，河北省的中医教育，是在带徒弟的基础上发展起来的。特别是整风和大跃进以后，全省迅速掀起一个大办中医教育运动。
    西医学习中医
  西医学习中医的运动，于1956年进入了一个高潮；学习的方法是：业余自修，拜中医为师，随中医伴诊，上业余中医学校，听中医学术报告，组织中西医会诊，建立西医学习中医在职和脱职班等多种多样的形式，把全省一万二千多名西医，卷入学习中医的浪潮，并有一千三百九十五名西医学会了两套本领，成为中西医结合的医生。
    大搞中医研究
    今年，为适应生产大跃进的需要，在全省广泛地建立了中医研究网运动。截至9月底止，全省已建立各种中医研究组织二千一百九十八处，研究员一万零二十一人，达到省有中医研究院，专区有中医研究分院，县有中医研究所，人民公社和一般医院均有中医研究人员。预计到年底，中医研究机构在全省城乡全面普及。这些研究机构，在探讨和整理中医学理和临床经验方面，将取得了一定成绩。几年来共出版发行内科一集、外科一集、妇产科治疗法、麻疹中医疗法、流行性乙型脑炎中医疗法、医学传心录和民间验方等十几种二十多万册，流传于国内各省和南洋一带，深受国内外医学界的欢迎。
      中医温课
    河北省有四万多名中医，有理论有经验的是少数老年人，多数人理论和经验还不足。提高中医理论技术水平，丰富临床经验不仅是中医的要求，也是广大人民的愿望。在党委领导下，各地开展了大办中医业余教育运动。据最近统计，全省已有中医业余大学七所，学员四百三十二人；中医业余学校九十五所，学员二万一千五百六十五人；中医进修学校三十五所，学员一千九百四十四人；河北中医学院还建立了中医进修系，培养师资。一年来，通过中医温课，这些学员已学完内经、伤寒论、中国医学史等课程。他们的理论和技术水平都有很大提高。
      普及针灸
    针灸是祖国医学中的重要组成部分，具有经济、简便、疗效高、易懂、易学的优点。为了普及针灸，省举办了针灸训练班，培养出针灸师资四百多名，平均每县有针灸教员二至三人。张家口专区已有十五万四千九百多名医生、干部、群众学会简易针灸；使卫生战线上增加了一批强大的生力军。
    开展群众性的药材生产收购
    药材生产上也开展了群众性“赶云贵、赛川广、道地药材河北长；野产药材家培植，鸟兽虫鱼变家养”的运动。全省在安国、平泉、山海关等地建立数十处药材试验场，开办了药材技术学校。今年培植药材面积比1955年增加近三倍；红花、生地、党参、半夏、佛手等二十七种地道药材都引种成功；野生的黄蓍、甘草、马兜铃、全虫、麻雀等二十五种动植物药材，变家养也先后成功，并开始大量培植、饲养。同时，全省又开展声势浩大的上山探宝运动，勘察了大青山、都山、小五台山等四千零八十八座大小山头，发现了野百芷、百合、海蛆等四十二种曾认为河北不出产的药材。在药材供应上，全省建立了星罗棋布的供应网，广大医药商业职工披星戴月翻山涉水开展送货上山下乡、下厂，满足群众的需要。（附图片）
