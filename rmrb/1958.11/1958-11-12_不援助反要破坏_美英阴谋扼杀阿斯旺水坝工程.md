    Not Helping But Sabotaging
    US and British Conspiracies to Strangle the Aswan Dam Project
    (Comprehensive report from this newspaper) With the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Aswan Dam project in the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic is about to commence construction. The Aswan High Dam Supreme Committee has approved an allocation of 700,000 Egyptian pounds for the preparatory work for the first phase of the dam project. Soviet, Polish, and East German archaeologists and experts are making great efforts to preserve the historical sites located on the foundation of the Aswan Dam, ensuring that these sites are not submerged after the construction of the dam begins.
    While distorting and slandering the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to the UAR in various ways, the United States and Britain are also conspiring to obstruct the start of the Aswan Dam project. When answering reporters' questions about the US attitude towards the Aswan Dam project, US Secretary of State Dulles once again reiterated the cliché of so-called "establishing regional development organizations" and "handling this issue on a multilateral basis," maliciously provoking the relationship between the United Arab Republic and other countries upstream of the Nile River, attempting to create disputes over the construction of the Aswan Dam and set obstacles for the construction plan. The British authorities also held secret talks with British Nile River experts, demanding that they provide urgent recommendations to obstruct the construction of this high dam. According to the Cairo newspaper "Al-Akhbar," Britain has formulated a secret plan on this issue and instructed its embassies abroad to implement it.
    Commenting on the destructive activities of the United States and Britain, the Cairo newspaper "Al-Ahram" pointed out, "There is no doubt that after Egypt achieved political independence, US and British imperialists opposed Egypt's achievement of economic independence. It cannot tolerate Egypt raising its head. For the imperialists, the High Dam is a project that should be strangled from the beginning." However, the newspaper said, "Despite the attempts of imperialist conspirators to obstruct it, this project will soon begin, which should be a lesson for them."

    不援助反要破坏
    美英阴谋扼杀阿斯旺水坝工程
    本报综合报道　在苏联的无私援助下，阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区的阿斯旺水坝工程即将动工兴建。阿斯旺水坝最高委员会已批准拨款七十万埃镑作为水坝第一期工程筹备工作的经费。苏联、波兰和民主德国的考古学家和专家们正在作巨大努力，设法保存座落在阿斯旺水坝地基上的古迹，使这些古迹在建筑水坝工程开始后不致为水淹没。
    美英两国在对苏联给予阿联的无私援助进行种种歪曲和诬蔑之余，还阴谋阻挠阿斯旺水坝工程的开建。美国国务卿杜勒斯在回答记者关于美国对阿斯旺水坝工程态度的问题时，又一次重弹了所谓“建立区域性发展组织”和在“多边的基础上处理这一问题”的滥调，恶毒地挑拨阿拉伯联合共和国和尼罗河上游其他国家的关系，企图在建筑阿斯旺水坝问题上制造纠纷，为施工计划设置障碍。英国当局也和英国的尼罗河问题专家进行了秘密会谈，要求他们提出紧急建议，来阻挠这个高水坝的建造。据开罗“消息报”报道，英国已就这一问题制订了一项秘密计划，并指示驻外使馆执行。
    开罗“金字塔报”在评论美英两国的破坏活动时指出，“毫无疑问，在埃及取得了政治独立以后，美英帝国主义者反对埃及在经济上取得独立。它不能容忍埃及抬起头来。对帝国主义者说来，高水坝是一项一开始就应该加以扼杀的工程”。但是，这家报纸说，“尽管帝国主义阴谋分子企图阻挠，这项工程不久就将开始进行，这应该是对他们的一个教训”。
