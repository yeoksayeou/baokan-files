    Learn from Huang Baomei

    We have seen many films with factory life as their theme, but this is the first time we have seen a film like "Huang Baomei." "Huang Baomei" is a very realistic work that reflects how textile workers work hard and cleverly in the great leap forward, and it also shows us where the advanced thinking of advanced figures is specifically manifested. This film gives people a very亲切 feeling. Seeing many things that happened in Huang Baomei's group is like happening around us.

    After watching Huang Baomei and her group eliminate white spots and other advanced deeds, I deeply realized that the main reason why Huang Baomei has been able to maintain the glorious title of labor model and always become a red flag is that she is modest, sincere, has a spirit of continuous innovation, and has a high degree of communist consciousness. This film gave me tremendous spiritual strength and encouragement, and made me deeply feel how important a role our textile female workers play in the development of the national economy!

    I am a roving frame doffer. In the past, I always thought that a doffer would not have any innovations. After watching "Huang Baomei," my thinking was eliminated. I want to sincerely learn from Huang Baomei, under the brilliant light of the general line, liberate my mind and use my brains, and contribute all my strength.

    向黄宝妹学习
    以工厂生活为主题的影片，我们已经看过很多了；但是像“黄宝妹”这样的影片还是第一次看到。“黄宝妹”是一部非常真实的作品，它反映了纺织工人在跃进的巨浪中怎样苦干，巧干，而且也向我们显示出：先进人物的先进思想具体表现在哪儿。这部影片给人很亲切的感觉，看到黄宝妹小组里发生的许多事情，就像发生在我们周围一样。
    看了黄宝妹和她的小组消灭白点等先进事迹，我深切地认识到，黄宝妹能一直保持着劳动模范的光荣称号，始终成为一面红旗，主要原因就是她虚心、诚恳，有不断革新的精神，有高度的共产主义觉悟。这部影片给了我巨大的精神力量和鼓舞，使我深深感到，我们纺织女工在发展国民经济中发挥了多么重大的作用！
    我是一个细纱落纱工。过去我总认为一个落纱工不会有什么创举。看了“黄宝妹”以后，我的这种思想消除了。我要诚恳地向黄宝妹学习，在总路线的光辉照耀下，解放思想开动脑筋，贡献出自己一切力量。
