    Steelworkers' Ironclad Friendship
    Dear Comrades of the Iron Smelting Department of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works:
    Hello! On behalf of all the workers and staff of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, I warmly congratulate you on the great October Socialist Revolution Day and congratulate you on your great achievements.
    In 1956, I visited your great country with our Chinese delegation. I witnessed with my own eyes the great achievements made by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Party and the government in industry, agriculture, and science and culture, which greatly encouraged and educated me. Since this year, we have continuously learned from the newspapers about the new achievements made by the Soviet people in developing the economy, culture, and further improving the material welfare of the people, and we are truly extremely happy.
    Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet people, our country is leaping forward at a speed of "one day equals twenty years." This year, the people of the whole country have launched a vigorous steelmaking movement. Many factories, rural areas, government offices, schools, street residents, and even the elderly and Young Pioneers have participated in steelmaking. Our steelworkers naturally do not lag behind. Under the slogan of "Seize steel from time!" the young men of our Iron Smelting Department's youth blast furnace are also full of energy. We eat by the furnace and sleep by the furnace. On the eve of the 41st anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, our blast furnace has already produced 668 tons of iron per day. In order to increase one more ton of steel for the country, we have also tried to learn technology and improve operations, and established three small converters beside the blast furnace to make steel at the same time. Now these three small converters are producing 12.5 tons of steel per day. We are truly becoming steelworkers, smelting both iron and steel.
    Let our friendship be as solid as steel, and let us advance side by side on the road to communism!
    Wang Cai, Head of the Youth Blast Furnace, Iron Smelting Department, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

### 钢铁工人的钢铁般的友谊

    钢铁工人的钢铁般的友谊亲爱的马哥尼托哥尔斯克钢铁公司炼铁部全体同志们：
    你们好！我代表石景山钢铁厂的全体职工向你们热烈地祝贺伟大的十月社会主义革命节，祝贺你们取得的伟大成绩。
    1956年，我随我国代表团访问过你们伟大的国家。我亲眼看见了苏联人民在党和政府的领导下，在工业、农业和科学文化方面取得的巨大成绩，使我受到很大的鼓舞和教育。今年以来，我们又不断地从报纸上知道，苏联人民在发展经济、文化和进一步改善人民物质福利方面所取得的新的成就，我们真是高兴极了。
    我们的国家在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在苏联人民大公无私的援助下，正在以“一天等于二十年”的速度飞跃前进。今年，全国人民掀起了轰轰烈烈的炼钢运动。许多工厂、农村、机关、学校、街道居民，甚至连老人和少先队员都参加了炼钢。我们钢铁工人自然也不落后。在“向时间夺钢！”的口号下，我们炼铁部青年高炉的小伙子们也是干劲冲天，我们吃在炉旁，睡在炉旁。在十月社会主义革命四十一周年的前夕，我们高炉已经日产铁达六百六十八吨。为了多给国家增加一吨钢，我们又设法学习技术、改进操作，在高炉旁建立了三个小转炉同时炼钢，现在这三个小转炉已经日产钢十二点五吨。又炼铁、又炼钢，我们真正成为钢铁工人了。
    让我们的友谊像钢铁一样坚固，让我们在奔向共产主义的大道上并肩前进！
    石景山钢铁厂炼铁部青年高炉炉长  王才
