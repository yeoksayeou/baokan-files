    In the large-scale mass movement of the whole party and the whole people running industry with steel as the key link, the coal industry took the lead and overfulfilled the 1958 plan two months ahead of schedule. October was a month of rapid development in coal production. The total coal output for the month was more than 70 million tons, a two-fold increase compared to September. By the end of October, the national coal output had reached 221 million tons, exceeding the annual state plan by more than 11 million tons. It can be said with certainty that China's coal output this year can reach 300 million tons. Britain produced 227 million tons of coal last year, and only produced more than 140 million tons of coal from January to September this year. Thus, we will leave Britain far behind this year. This is another great victory for the mass movement in the industrial production front in our country, and a great contribution made by the millions of labor armies on the coal industry front to complete the task of 10.7 million tons of steel.
    This great victory fully demonstrates the enormous power of carrying out mass movements on the industrial front. In the past two months, the mass movement with steel as the key link has driven all industrial sectors. In the coal industry, a vigorous mass movement to run coal mines by the whole people was quickly launched. This movement is a great revolution that enables China's coal industry to achieve high-speed development and fundamentally change the face of the coal industry. The mass movement in the coal industry, like other industries, must embody the principle of combining "large, foreign, and group" with "small, local, and group." The "small, local, and group" movement is the basic factor for the coal industry to complete the national plan two months ahead of schedule this year. After the secretaries took command and the whole party took action, more than 20 million people across the country, carrying hoes and pots, marched into the mountains with high spirits to extract coal from the earth. People's battle slogan is: "Where thousands of tons of iron are produced, tens of thousands of tons of coal will be produced," and they have launched high-yield satellites at a rapid pace. In October, the daily output level of local coal mines increased sharply from 290,000 tons in September to 1.65 million tons, an increase of 4.7 times. The number of small coal kilns across the country has increased from more than 20,000 to more than 100,000. At present, 77 counties with a daily output of 10,000 tons of coal have emerged in provinces (regions) such as Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Zhejiang. Ten counties, such as Liucheng and Xincheng in Guangxi, Yuxian, Linru, Jiyuan, Shanxian, Dengfeng, Xin'an, and Bo'ai in Henan Province, and Hongzhao in Shanxi, have all launched high-yield satellites with a daily output of more than one million tons of coal. This is an unprecedented miracle in the history of China's coal industry. In October alone, local coal mines produced 51 million tons, exceeding the total coal output in the first nine months of this year. This astonishing figure was unimaginable even two months ago, but now it is vividly displayed in front of people. This example powerfully illustrates that carrying out mass movements on the industrial front is a correct path for the high-speed development of China's industry.
    Using the "small, local, and group" method to develop the coal industry has special and important significance for the southern provinces of our country. It not only solves the need for coal locally, alleviating the transportation tension caused by transporting coal from the north to the south. More importantly, it has found many extremely rich coal resources in the southern provinces, thoroughly bankrupting the "Southern coal scarcity theory" of bourgeois scholars. This makes it possible to establish large and small coal bases in the southern provinces in a short period of time, so that the coal industry can develop rapidly, creating conditions for changing the long-term unreasonable distribution of the coal industry in our country.
    While the "small, local, and group" movement in the coal industry is being carried out, the "large, foreign, and group" movement is also developing greatly. Many coal mining enterprises have conscientiously promoted the experience of two participations, one reform, four greats, and three combinations, bringing enterprise management into a new era. The communist consciousness of the working masses has greatly improved, and many advanced experiences have been created. The output of many large coal mines has increased sharply in the past two months. In the past, many people doubted whether mass movements could be carried out in large enterprises. They were afraid that mass movements would disrupt the enterprises. They believed that industrial technology was complex and could not carry out mass movements like the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and "Land Reform" movements. This outdated thinking restricted people's hands and feet, resulting in a cold and deserted atmosphere in the enterprises and a lack of vitality. The mass movement in the past two months has not only refuted these skeptics and shattered the mysterious views of running industry in the past and the so-called regularization thinking, but also found a path for high-speed development of the coal industry.
    Although the production of the coal industry has completed the plan two months ahead of schedule, judging from the rapid development of the steel industry in the future, the task of the coal industry is still very arduous. This requires that the mass movement must be further widely and deeply carried out on the coal industry front. We must guard against arrogance and rashness, and create greater victories on the basis of victory.
    In areas where "small, local, and group" has not yet been popularized, it should be quickly popularized to allow small coal kilns to bloom everywhere and shine brightly. Winter has little rain and is a favorable season for mining coal. We must seize this favorable opportunity to quickly launch the movement of the whole party and the whole people to run coal mines. Now no one doubts whether it is possible to rely on the power of the masses to run small coal kilns on a large scale. However, many people still doubt whether small coal kilns can be consolidated and improved. They believe that opening small coal kilns is a temporary measure because it requires a lot of people, can only be mined in shallow outcrops, the quality of the coal is poor, and transportation is difficult. Therefore, it can only be used for emergency relief and is not a long-term solution. It can only be mined when it is easy to mine, and it cannot be mined when it is difficult to mine. These are all one-sided views. Comrades with this view often have an unclear understanding of the relationship between the development and improvement of things. They are accustomed to seeing things as unchanging and cannot see the inevitable trend of change in things. They do not understand that everything must go through a lot of development before it can be improved. Without quantity, there is no quality. It is impossible to imagine that mobilizing the masses to run coal mines will be perfect from the beginning. From the perspective of the natural formation conditions of coal seams, it can only start with digging outcrops and shallow parts first, and then gradually develop to deep parts. If large and deep wells are built from the beginning, that would be a strange thing. However, with the increasing demand for coal and the increasing richness of the masses' experience in running mines, they will inevitably consolidate and improve the opened small coal kilns through technical transformation.
    The technical transformation of small coal kilns is an important task for the coal industry at present and an inevitable trend for the in-depth development of the mass movement. In order to do a good job in the technical transformation of small coal kilns, we should first make practical plans in terms of geology and transportation conditions, and adopt indigenous methods and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to carry out technical transformation in terms of lifting, drainage, ventilation, and transportation, so that it becomes a large and small coal base. These coal bases should be coordinated with industries such as steel, fertilizer, and oil refining as much as possible to form a joint enterprise. This will be of great benefit in terms of labor force allocation, raw material supply, and mutual cooperation in the future. If the country can establish three or four hundred new coal industrial bases with an annual output of 300,000 to 500,000 tons this winter and next spring, it will play a huge role in ensuring the needs of the steel industry, other industries, and transportation in a greater leap forward next year. We believe that if we can rely on the masses to build tens of thousands of small coal kilns, we will inevitably be able to rely on the masses to complete the technical transformation of small coal kilns.
    Judging from the overall situation, the "large, foreign, and group" movement in the coal industry has not been carried out widely, deeply, or thoroughly enough. Although the national coal output has completed this year's task ahead of schedule and overfulfilled the target, state-owned coal mines have not yet completed the annual plan. State-owned coal mines are responsible for supplying coking coal needed by key steel enterprises. At present, steel production is rising sharply and more coking coal is needed. Therefore, it is necessary to further carry out mass movements to ensure that the production task for this year is completed half a month or a month ahead of schedule.
    It should be pointed out that since this year, the vast number of coal mine workers have created many good production experiences and launched many high-yield "satellites." The problem is that many experiences have not been universally promoted, which hinders the further development of the potential of coal mines. Today, one of the important tasks of the leaders of coal mining enterprises is to comprehensively popularize the advanced experiences that have been obtained, constantly overcome weak links, and make the level of all producers catch up with the level of advanced producers. Only in this way can advanced experiences blossom and bear fruit, and achieve large-scale high yields. All management cadres of enterprises must appear as ordinary laborers, go deep into production, go deep into the masses, and work, eat, and live with the workers. Only in this way can the relationship between people in the enterprise be fundamentally changed, the communist style of the workers and masses be greatly improved, the management of the enterprise appear in a brand-new look, and production continue to leap forward.
    With the high-speed development of the national economy, the production task of the coal industry next year will be even more arduous. Therefore, we must continue to muster greater revolutionary vigor and, while striving for more overproduction of coal this year, seize the time to prepare for next year, especially we should seize the technical transformation of small coal kilns and the work of tunneling and stripping in large coal mines. The basic construction work this year should also be grasped fiercely. From this winter to next year, about 160 million tons of new mines are required to be put into production. The task is very arduous. Therefore, we are required to prepare from now on to welcome a greater leap forward next year.

### 群众运动在煤炭工业中开花结果

    群众运动在煤炭工业中开花结果
    在以钢为纲全党全民办工业的大规模的群众运动中，煤炭工业一马当先，提前两个月超额完成了1958年的计划。10月份是煤炭生产飞跃发展的一个月。全月产煤七千多万吨，比9月份提高了两倍。到10月底全国煤炭的产量已经达到二亿二千一百万吨，超过全年国家计划一千一百多万吨。可以肯定地说，今年我国煤炭产量可以达到三亿吨。英国去年产煤二亿二千七百万吨，今年一月到九月才产煤一亿四千多万吨，这样，我们在今年就将把英国远远抛在后面。这是我国工业生产战线上大搞群众运动的又一个大胜利，是煤炭工业战线上千百万劳动大军为完成一千零七十万吨钢的任务所作出的一个伟大贡献。
    这个伟大的胜利充分显示了在工业战线上大搞群众运动的巨大威力。最近两个月以来，以钢为纲的群众运动带动了一切工业部门。在煤炭工业中迅速地掀起了一个声势浩大的全民办煤矿的运动。这个运动是使我国煤炭工业能够获得高速度发展和基本改变煤炭工业面貌的一个大革命。煤炭工业的群众运动和其它工业一样，必须体现“大洋群”和“小土群”相结合的方针。“小土群”的运动是今年煤炭工业提前两个月完成国家计划的基本因素。在书记挂帅、全党动手后，全国有二千多万人背着镢头，带着锅灶，志气昂扬地深入丛山峻岭向大地索取煤炭。人们的战斗口号是：“那里产千吨铁，那里就产万吨煤”，他们以一日千里之势，连放高产卫星。10月份地方煤矿的日产水平，由9月份的二十九万吨猛增到一百六十五万吨，提高了四点七倍。全国小煤窑由两万多个发展到十万多个。目前在河南、湖南、湖北、广西、山西、四川、云南、甘肃、浙江等省（区）先后出现了七十七个日产万吨煤的县。像广西的柳城、忻城，河南省的禹县、临汝、济源、陕县、登封、新安、博爱，山西的洪赵等十个县，都曾经放出日产百万吨以上煤炭的高产卫星。这是我国煤炭工业史上从来未有过的奇迹。10月一个月，地方煤矿就生产了五千一百万吨，超过了今年前九个月煤产量的总和。这个惊人的数字，在两个月以前，人们连想也不敢想，可是现在却活生生地摆在人们面前了。这个事例有力地说明了在工业战线上大搞群众运动，是一条高速度发展我国工业的正确路线。
    用小土群的办法发展煤炭工业，对我国南方各省来说，更有其特殊重要的意义。它不仅就地解决了煤炭的需要，缓和了由于北煤南运而造成的运输上的紧张情况。而更重要的是：在南方各省找到了许多的极为丰富的煤炭资源。使过去资产阶级学者的“南方少煤论”彻底破产了。这样就有可能在短时期内在南方各省建立起大大小小的煤炭基地，使煤炭工业得以迅速发展，为改变我国长期以来煤炭工业分布不合理的现象创造了条件。
    在煤炭工业“小土群”运动开展的同时，“大洋群”运动同样有着很大的发展。许多煤矿企业认真地推行了两参一改、四大和三结合的经验，使企业的管理进入了一个新的时期，工人群众共产主义的觉悟有了很大的提高，创造了许多先进经验，许多大型煤矿的产量近两个月来有了急剧的增长。在大企业中能否搞群众运动，过去许多人是有怀疑的。他们怕群众运动会把企业搞乱。他们认为工业技术复杂，不能像“三反”“五反”“土改”那样搞群众运动。这种陈腐的思想，束缚着人们的手脚，其结果是企业中冷冷清清，缺乏生气。两个月来的群众运动不仅已经驳倒了这些怀疑论者，打破了过去办工业的神秘观点和所谓正规化的思想，并使煤炭工业找到了一条高速度发展的道路。
    虽然，煤炭工业的生产已经提前两个月完成了计划，但是从今后钢铁工业急剧发展的情况来看，煤炭工业的任务还是十分艰巨的。这就要求在煤炭工业战线上还必须进一步广泛深入地开展群众运动。必须戒骄戒躁，在胜利的基础上，创造更大胜利。
    在“小土群”方面，还没有普及的地区，应很快普及起来，让小煤窑遍地开花，大放光彩。冬季雨水少，是开采煤炭有利的季节，要抓住这一有利时机，迅速开展全党全民办煤矿运动。现在对能否依靠群众的力量大办小煤窑是没有人再怀疑了。但是对小煤窑能否巩固和提高却还有许多人怀疑，他们认为开小煤窑是临时措施，因为用人多，只能在露头浅部开采，煤的质量差，运输困难，因而只能救急，不是长远之计，只能容易开采时开采，困难开采时就不能开。这都是一些片面性的看法。有这种看法的同志往往是对事物的发展和提高的关系认识不清。他们习惯于把事物看成是一成不变的，看不到事物的必然变化的趋势。不懂得一切事物都是经过大量发展才能获得提高的，没有数量，也就没有质量。不可能设想，发动群众办煤矿一开始就会做得十全十美。从煤层自然生成的条件来看，一开始只能是先挖露头和浅部，然后才能逐步向深部发展。如果一开始就搞起大井深井，那才是怪事。但随着煤炭需要量的日益增长和群众办矿经验的日益丰富，他们势必会把已开的小煤窑经过技术上的改造，进一步巩固和提高起来。
    小煤窑的技术改造，是煤炭工业当前的一项重要任务，是群众运动深入开展的必然趋势。为了做好小煤窑的技术改造工作，应当首先根据地质和交通运输等条件，在地区上切实地加以规划，采取土办法和土洋结合的办法在提升、排水、通风、运输诸方面进行技术改造，使它成为大大小小的煤炭基地。这些煤炭基地应该尽可能地同钢铁、化肥、炼油等工业配合起来，形成一个联合企业。这样在今后劳动力调配、原材料供应和相互协作等方面都会有很大好处。如果全国能在今冬明春建立起三、四百个年产三十到五十万吨的新的煤炭工业基地，那么，对保证明年钢铁工业、其它工业和交通运输业在更大跃进中对煤炭的需要，将发挥巨大的作用。我们相信，能依靠群众建设数万个小煤窑，也就必然能够依靠群众完成小煤窑的技术改造任务。
    煤炭工业的“大洋群”运动，从总的情况看来，开展的还不广、不深、不透。全国煤炭产量虽然已经提前超额完成今年的任务，但就国营煤矿来说，还没有完成全年计划。国营煤矿担负着重点钢铁企业所需炼焦煤的供应任务。目前钢铁生产正在急剧上升，需要更多的焦煤，因此，还必须进一步大搞群众运动，保证提前半个月或一个月完成今年的生产任务。
    应当指出，今年以来，广大煤矿职工创造了许许多多好的生产经验，放出了不少的高产“卫星”。问题在于有很多经验还未能普遍地加以推广，这就障碍着煤矿潜力的进一步发挥。今天，煤矿企业领导者的重要任务之一就是要把已经获得的先进经验，全面地普及起来，不断地克服薄弱环节，使全体生产者的水平赶上先进者的水平。只有这样才能使先进经验开花结果，获得大面积的丰产。所有企业的管理干部要以普通劳动者的姿态出现，深入生产，深入群众，同工人群众同劳动，同吃，同住，只有这样才能从根本上改变企业中人与人的关系，大大提高职工群众的共产主义风格，使企业的管理出现一个崭新的面貌，使生产不断跃进。
    随着国民经济的高速度发展，煤炭工业明年的生产任务将是更加繁重。因此，必须继续鼓足更大的革命干劲，在争取今年更多超产煤炭的同时，抓紧做好明年的准备工作，特别是应抓紧小煤窑的技术改造和大煤矿的掘进、剥离等工作。今年的基本建设工作也要狠狠抓一下，今冬到明年要求有一亿六千万吨左右新矿井移交生产，任务是十分艰巨的，因此要求从现在起做好准备，以迎接明年更大的跃进。
