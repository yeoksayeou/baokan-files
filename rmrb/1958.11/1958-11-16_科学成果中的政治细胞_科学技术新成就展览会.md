Visiting the Exhibition of New Scientific and Technological Achievements currently held in Beijing was some time ago, but several profound impressions still linger in my mind and cannot be dispelled for a long time: No matter how large China's territory is, from the coast to the interior, from the interior to the border areas, whether it is plains or mountains, whether it is advanced areas or backward areas, wherever there is the leadership of the Party, there can be excellent scientific achievements; many of these scientific achievements have simple structures and are very "earthy," but they can solve major problems in national production and construction, and are world firsts, and are easy to promote everywhere. A large part of the creators of these new scientific and technological achievements are manual laborers. Their achievements show that under the leadership of the Party, after being freed from exploitation and oppression and becoming masters of their own affairs, Chinese workers and peasants are using their brains and hands to fill the gap between mental and manual labor. The more than 3,000 exhibits of various kinds here are engraved with the same truth: the Party's specific leadership in science and technology, the Party's mass line, and the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and blossoming everywhere are the guarantee for the ultra-high-speed development of science and technology in our country and an invincible weapon.

At this exhibition, one can have a bird's-eye view of the magnificent scene of the national technological revolution and the great leap forward in science. Here are the wheat peeling machine created by veteran workers, which the United States has studied for more than ten years without success, and the steam rapid rice seedling cultivation method created by farmers; there is the X-ray horizontal tomography machine of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which exceeds the world level, the joint door and window machine with nine processes pioneered by Qinghai Province, and the method of smelting pig iron from lean iron ore created by Guizhou Province; there is oxalic acid, an important industrial raw material, extracted by housewives using ladles, medicine bottles, tea sets, and candy jars as chemical utensils; there are grain cleaning machines and automatic rice vending machines made of old copper, scrap iron, and wood by farmers and government cadres; there are electronic measuring devices that can verify the "mystery" of traditional Chinese medicine meridian theory; there are mythical grain high-yield technologies and physical specimens; there are also atomic reactors (models), various electronic instruments and precision machinery, heart surgery using extracorporeal circulation, reactive dyes, and artificial corundum that proudly stand at the peak of world science....

In the exhibition room of Zhejiang Province, there are models of the "Rapid Steam Rice Seedling Cultivation Method" created by seven farmers. This is a pioneering work in the history of world agriculture. However, its equipment is so simple: no machinery is needed, let alone precision instruments, only a thatched house that can keep warm, two silkworm cooking stoves, some wooden frames and bamboo frames for raising silkworms. After generating steam, rice grains can be cultivated into seedlings in seven days. The time only takes seven days, which is several times faster than natural seedling cultivation in the field; and it can make the seedlings green and grow earlier, which is convenient for weeding, can be cultivated in large quantities, does not occupy cultivated land, and saves about nine-tenths of the labor compared with natural seedling cultivation in the field.

Among the exhibits in Hubei Province, there are many construction machines, and the electric bricklaying machine is one of the stars. This machine is about the size of a briefcase and is composed of some iron chains, gears, electric small motors, and transformers. The structure is not complicated. But it is the world's first machine, which can increase work efficiency five times compared with manual bricklaying. Eighteen countries have written to order and request drawings and information. The main author of this exhibit, Long Wenzhong, was a wandering apprentice in the old society. After liberation, Long Wenzhong entered a shipyard and became a labor model in 1950. In 1951, he was transferred to the Wuhan City Construction Company as an inspector. In 1952, the Wuhan construction system generally promoted Su Changyou's double-handed slurry squeezing method and Fu Hongbin's ash spreading machine, which increased work efficiency several times and the quality was better than the past knife ash masonry. However, workers generally reflected: "The ash spreading machine is good, but the fingers can't stand it." The workers' feedback aroused the attention of the Party organization of the Wuhan City Construction Company, and immediately proposed to change this situation. Solving the problem of "fingers can't stand it" was put on the important agenda. Long Wenzhong, an inspector from a worker background, accepted the task assigned by the Party without bargaining and immediately racked his brains to conceive a bricklaying machine. He still thought about this matter every night when he slept in bed. One midnight, he was inspired by the "checha" sound of the locomotive coming from afar, and immediately jumped out of bed: he used his hands as "shengda" (a bricklaying tool), and used two books as bricks, and pondered on the table with a stretch and a contraction. The employees in the dormitory looked at him and said, "Old Long, are you crazy!" Old Long's day and night hard work made his research have some clues, but because he was stained with individualism, he hoped to monopolize the credit, so he closed the door and worked alone. At this time, the Party organization promptly pointed out to him that the main reason for his failure was working alone. He was asked to make the bricklaying machine plan public and solicit everyone's opinions. Long Wenzhong listened to the Party's instructions. Under the leadership of the Party organization, the wisdom of many people in various professions was concentrated, fourteen machines were trial-produced, suggestions from all aspects were absorbed, and after more than three hundred revisions, the world's first electric slurry squeezing bricklaying machine was finally born.

The Party's specific leadership in science is not only in grasping and solving key ideological problems, but also in grasping and solving key problems in science and technology itself. Among the exhibits in Shanxi Province, there is an outstanding research achievement—the electric pneumatic brake valve for trains. It is a device for braking trains, and has great advantages over the air brake currently used in trains. It can allow trains to increase speed, thereby increasing transportation efficiency. In the process of creation by the workers of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, the key problem encountered first was what plan to adopt for manufacturing. At this time, the worker masses, under the guidance of the Party Committee, put forward many plans under the leadership of the Party Committee for comparative experiments, so that the most suitable plan could be found in the shortest time. At that time, some people believed based on theoretical calculations that the valve stem could not be lifted, and the electric pneumatic brake valve could not be made. At this time, the Party seized this key point and mobilized everyone to think of ways to solve this problem. If the valve stem was too long, it was immediately shortened; if it was too thick, it was immediately thinned; if the round groove was not good, the vertical groove was immediately spun. After more than 40 hours of hard work, this key point was finally broken, the valve stem was lifted, and the principle of the electric pneumatic brake valve was proven to be correct through experiments. Therefore, on this basis, the worker masses further developed collective wisdom and received the help and guidance of engineering and technical personnel, and their ideals were finally realized.

The horizontal tomography machine was created by Laxi, a Mongolian military doctor and Communist Party member in the radiology department of the People's Liberation Army Hospital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The International Society of Radiology Conference mentioned that cross-sectional or horizontal tomographic X-ray photography is one of the directions for future development and research. Laxi boldly tried to make this kind of camera. The Party organization and leading comrades of the hospital did their best to support his bold creation. In the absence of any information, after painstaking research, after getting some clues in theory, he used waste materials such as old dental swivel chairs, iron wire, bandages, wooden boards, and wooden sticks for experiments. After several failures, he finally obtained the first horizontal tomographic X-ray photo on New Year's Eve in 1957. Then, according to the design of Comrade Laxi, the Inner Mongolia Military Region Repair Shop used tap water pipes, steel, etc. to trial-produce the first horizontal tomographic X-ray machine, but the experimental results were not working. At this time, Laxi thought of Chairman Mao's instruction "When encountering difficulties, find the masses...", so he invited two members of the Communist Youth League in the hospital to hold an on-site meeting and studied until late at night, and the next day he found the workers in the repair shop to study together, and finally found the cause of the failure and made this machine successfully. Clear horizontal tomographic X-ray photos of the human patella, the lower end of the femur, and the chest were taken. At present, all similar instruments abroad are machines that do not move, and patients sit on swivel chairs and rotate continuously, which makes patients suffer. The instrument designed by Laxi, starting from the care of patients, does not require patients to sit on the machine and rotate, but the machine rotates around the patient. After appraisal by experts, they all believed that this instrument was much better than similar products abroad.

Many viewers left such remarks after watching the exhibition: Watching science and technology is equivalent to taking a political lesson! (Attached picture)

    科学成果中的政治细胞
    ——科学技术新成就展览会
    新华社记者　吕新初
    参观正在北京举行的科学技术新成就展览会，已经是好些日子以前的事，但是几个深刻的印象至今仍萦绕在脑际长久不能消散：不管我国的幅员有多大，从沿海到内地、从内地到边疆，不论平原和山地，不论先进地区和落后地区，哪里有党的领导，哪里就能出现优越的科学成果；这些科学成果中有许多是构造简单、十分“土气”，然而却能解决国家生产建设中的重大问题，却是世界上的创举，又便于到处推广，这些科学技术新成果的缔造者中间，有很大一部分是体力劳动者，他们的成就说明中国的工农体力劳动者在党的领导下，摆脱了剥削和压迫、当家作主以后，正在用自己的脑汁和双手填平脑力劳动和体力劳动间的鸿沟。这里展出的三千多件各式各样的展品，它们镌着同样的一个真理：党对于科学技术的具体领导，党的群众路线和土洋并举、遍地开花的方针，是我国科学技术超高速发展的保证，是无往不胜的武器。
    在这个展览会上，可以鸟瞰全国技术革命和科学大跃进的宏伟情景。这里有老工人创造的、美国研究了十多年还没有成功的小麦脱皮机和农民创造的蒸气快速育秧法；有内蒙古自治区的超过世界水平的X射线水平断层摄影机、青海省首创的九种工序联合门窗机和贵州省创造的贫铁矿冶炼生铁方法；有家庭妇女用水瓢、药瓶、茶具、糖果罐当作化学器皿提炼出来的重要工业原料草酸；有农民、机关干部用旧铜、废铁、木头制成的净粮机和自动售米机；有能够证实“玄虚”的中医经络学说的电子测定器；有神话般的粮食丰产技术和实物标本；也有傲居世界科学尖峰的原子反应堆（模型）、各种电子仪器和精密机械、运用体外循环进行的心脏手术、活性染料和人造钢玉……。
    浙江省的展览室里，陈列着七个农民创造的“快速蒸气育秧法”模型。这是世界农业史上的创举。然而它的设备是如此简单：不用机械，更没有精密仪器，只要一间可以保温的茅屋，两座巢丝锅灶，一些养蚕用的木架和竹扁，产生蒸气以后，就可以使谷粒在七天内育成秧苗，时间只要七天，比田间自然育秧要快好几倍；并且可以使秧苗提早发青发棵，便于除杂草，可以大量培育，不占耕地面积，人工方面，比田间自然育秧节省约十分之九。
    在湖北省的展品中，有许多建筑机械，电动砌墙机是其中的一颗明星。这架机器像手提皮箱那么大，是一些铁链、齿轮、电动小马达和变压器等组成，结构并不繁复。但是它是世界首创的机器，它比手工砌墙可提高工效五倍。有十八个国家来信订货和索取图纸资料。这件展品的主要作者龙文忠，在旧社会里是一个到处流浪的徒工。解放后，龙文忠进了造船厂工作，1950年成了劳动模范。1951年他被调到武汉市修建公司当检工员。1952年，武汉建筑系统普遍推广了苏长友双手挤浆法和傅鸿宾创造的铺灰器，使工作效率提高了好几倍，质量也比过去刀灰砌的好。但是工人普遍反映：“铺灰器好是好，就是手指吃不消。”工人的反映，引起了武汉市建筑公司的党组织的注意，立刻提出要改变这个状况。解决“手指吃不消”的问题就被提到重要的议事日程上来。工人出身的检工员龙文忠毫不还价地接受了党分配的这个任务，马上就挖空心思去设想砌墙机。每天深夜睡在床上他还是想着这件事。一天午夜，他受到远处传来火车牵引机的“切查”声的启发，立即从床上跳起来：双手比作“生达”，用两本书比作砖头，在桌子上一伸一缩地琢磨起来。寝室里的职工们看着他说：“老龙，你是不是发神经病了！”老龙这般日夜苦思，使得他的研究已有眉目，但是由于他沾染了个人主义思想，希望独占功劳，因此一个人关着房门单干。这时党组织及时向他指出，他不能成功的主要症结在于单干。要他把砌墙机的方案公开出来，征求大家意见。龙文忠听从了党的指示。在党组织的领导下，集中了各个专业的许多人的智慧，试制了十四部机械，吸取了各方面的建议，经过三百多次修改，世界上第一架电动挤浆砌墙机终于诞生。
    党对于科学的具体领导，不但在于能抓住和解决思想上的关键问题，同样在于抓住和解决科学技术业务本身的关键问题。在山西省的展品中有一项杰出的研究成果——火车电空制动阀。它是火车煞车的装置，比目前火车所用的空气制动机有很大优点，它可以让火车提高速度，从而提高运输效率。太原铁路管理局的工人在创作过程中，首先碰到的关键问题是采用什么方案来制造。这时工人群众就根据党委的指导，在党委领导下提出了很多方案进行比较试验，这样就能在最短的时间内找出了最合适的方案。当时有人根据理论计算认为阀杆不能提起来，电空制动阀就不可能制成。这时党就抓住了这个关键，发动大家针对这个问题想办法，阀杆长了立即旋短；粗了立即旋细，圆槽不行立即旋竖槽。经过四十多小时的苦战，终于突破了这个关键，阀杆被提起来了，电空制动阀的原理经过试验证明正确。于是在这个基础上，工人群众进一步发挥集体智慧，并且得到了工程技术人员的帮助指点，他们的理想终于实现。
    水平断层摄影机是内蒙古自治区解放军医院放射科的一个蒙族军医、共产党员拉西创造的。国际放射学会会议曾提到横断面或水平的断层X光摄影术是今后发展和研究的方向之一。拉西大胆地试制这种摄影机。医院的党组织和领导同志竭力支持他的大胆创造。在没有任何资料的情况下，经过苦心钻研，在理论上得到一些门路以后，他便用牙科的旧转椅、铁丝、绷带、木板、木棍等废料试验，经过几次失败，终于在1957年除夕得到第一张水平断层的X光照片。接着，便由内蒙古军区修械所根据拉西同志的设计，用自来水管、钢材等试制成了第一部水平断层X光摄影机，但是试验的结果不灵。这时拉西想起了毛主席指示的“遇到困难找群众……”，他便邀集医院里两个共青团员开现场会议，研究到深晚，第二天又找修械所的工人一起研究，终于找出了失败原因，把这架机器制造成功，摄出了清晰的人体髌骨、股骨下端和胸部的水平断层X光照片。目前外国所有的同类仪器，都是机器不动，病人坐在旋椅上不断转动，这样就会使病人痛苦。而拉西设计的仪器，从爱护病人出发，病人坐在机器上不必转动，机器则围绕着病人转。经过专家们的鉴定，都认为这架仪器比外国同类产品要优越得多。
    许多观众看了展览后留下了这样的感言：看的是科学技术，却等于上了一堂政治课！（附图片）
