    CPC Central Committee Sends Telegram to Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee to Congratulate the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the Hungarian Communist Party
    Xinhua News Agency, November 19th The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China today sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, congratulating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Communist Party. The telegram is as follows:
    To the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, dear comrades:
    On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China and the entire Chinese people, extends warm fraternal congratulations to you, and through you, to all members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian people.
    The Hungarian Communist Party was born in the revolutionary struggle to achieve the dictatorship of the proletariat. Over the past forty years, it has experienced a difficult, tortuous, and glorious path of struggle. Under the influence of the October Revolution, the revolutionary socialists of Hungary once established a Soviet Republic in their country. Although this republic existed for a short time, it wrote a glorious page in the history of the Hungarian revolution and the international workers' movement. During the dark rule of Horthy fascism and the German fascist occupation, the Hungarian Communists persevered in a long-term underground struggle. After liberation, the Hungarian Communists led the Hungarian people in carrying out land reform, realizing the nationalization of industry, and carrying out socialist construction. In October 1956, the imperialists, colluding with the Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces, launched an armed rebellion in an attempt to strangle Hungary's socialist cause. The Hungarian Communists, headed by Comrade Kádár, with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and the support of all progressive forces in the world, resolutely suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots, defended Hungary's socialist cause, and shattered the imperialists' conspiracy to open a breach in the socialist camp and turn Hungary into a forward base for instigating war. Since then, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Hungarian people have consolidated the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat, healed the wounds caused by the counter-revolutionary riots, restored the national economy, improved the people's living standards, and continued socialist construction at an even greater speed. At the same time, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has also made an effective effort on the ideological front, achieving remarkable achievements in eliminating the ideological influence of domestic counter-revolutionaries and revisionism. Hungarian comrades, together with the Communist Parties of all countries, have also defended the principles of Marxism-Leninism, criticized Yugoslav modern revisionism, and powerfully exposed the role of the Yugoslav leadership group as instigators and interventionists in the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots, thereby making valuable contributions to maintaining and strengthening the unity of the entire socialist camp and the international communist movement centered on the Soviet Union. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has also made significant contributions in opposing the imperialist policies of aggression and war.
    The Chinese Communists and the Chinese people have watched with great care and enthusiasm the heroic struggle of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party over the past two years, and are rejoiced and encouraged by the great achievements you have made. On this day of the birth of the Hungarian Communist Party, we wish the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian people greater and greater achievements in the struggle to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, complete socialist transformation, and advance socialist construction, in the struggle to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and strengthen the unity of the international communist movement, and in the struggle to defend world peace and strive for human progress.

    中共中央致电匈社会主义工人党中央
    祝贺匈共成立四十周年
    新华社19日讯　中国共产党中央委员会今天致电匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会，祝贺匈牙利共产党成立四十周年。电文如下：匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    在这匈牙利共产党成立四十周年的时候，中国共产党中央委员会谨代表中国共产党全体党员和全中国人民，向你们，并通过你们，向匈牙利社会主义工人党全体党员和匈牙利人民致以热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    匈牙利共产党一开始就是在争取实现无产阶级专政的革命斗争中诞生的。四十年来，它经历了艰难曲折的、光荣的斗争道路。在十月革命的影响下，匈牙利的革命的社会主义者曾经在本国建立了苏维埃共和国。这一共和国存在的时间虽短，可是它在匈牙利革命和国际工人运动的历史上写下了光辉的一页。在霍尔蒂法西斯黑暗统治和德国法西斯占领期间，匈牙利共产党人又艰苦卓绝地坚持了长期的地下斗争。解放以后，匈牙利共产党人领导匈牙利人民进行了土地改革，实现了工业国有化，进行了社会主义建设。1956年10月，帝国主义者同匈牙利反革命势力勾结在一起发动了武装叛乱，企图扼杀匈牙利社会主义事业。以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利共产党人，在苏联的兄弟援助和世界上一切进步力量的支持之下，坚决地镇压了反革命暴乱，保卫了匈牙利的社会主义事业，帝国主义妄图在社会主义阵营内部打开缺口，使匈牙利成为帝国主义策动战争的前哨阵地的阴谋，归于泡影。从那时以来，匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党的领导之下，巩固了无产阶级专政制度，医治了反革命暴乱所造成的创伤，恢复了国民经济，改善了人民生活，并以更大的速度继续进行着社会主义建设。与此同时，匈牙利社会主义工人党在思想战线上也作了有效的努力，在消除国内反革命和修正主义的思想影响方面取得了显著成就。匈牙利同志们还同各国共产党人一起，捍卫了马克思列宁主义的原则，批判了南斯拉夫现代修正主义，对南斯拉夫领导集团在匈牙利反革命暴乱中所起的挑拨者和干涉者的作用作了有力的揭露，从而在维护和加强以苏联为中心的整个社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结方面作出了可贵的贡献。在反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策方面，匈牙利社会主义工人党也作出了重大的贡献。
    中国共产党人和中国人民以极大的关怀和热情，注视着匈牙利社会主义工人党两年来的英勇斗争，并且为你们所取得的伟大成就感到欢欣鼓舞。在这匈牙利共产党诞生的日子，我们谨祝匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利人民在为巩固无产阶级专政、完成社会主义改造和推进社会主义建设的斗争中，在为捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性和加强国际共产主义运动的团结的斗争中，在为保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的斗争中，获得更多更大的成就。
      中国共产党中央委员会
