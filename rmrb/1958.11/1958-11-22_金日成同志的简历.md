Biography of Comrade Kim Il-sung

Comrade Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, was born on April 15, 1912, in a poor peasant family in Mangyongdae, South Pyongan Province. His father dedicated his life to the national liberation struggle against Japanese imperialism.

At the age of fourteen, Comrade Kim Il-sung followed his father to Northeast China. After arriving in the Northeast, he entered Yuwen Middle School in Jilin. While studying at the middle school, Comrade Kim Il-sung joined the Communist Youth League in 1926. He stood at the forefront of the student movement, striving to unite progressive students around the underground organization, the Communist Youth League.

Comrade Kim Il-sung was arrested by reactionary Chinese warlords for carrying out Communist Youth League work among students and propagating Marxist-Leninist revolutionary ideas. From 1927 to 1928, he lived in imprisonment in Jilin Prison.

After graduating from middle school in 1929, he served as the Secretary of the East Manchuria Special District Committee of the Communist Youth League. Comrade Kim Il-sung joined the Communist Party in 1931.

In 1931, Comrade Kim Il-sung united the anti-Japanese forces centered on workers and peasants in Northeast China, organized the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force, and unyieldingly endured hardships to continue the armed struggle against Japanese imperialism for more than fifteen years.

In 1934, he merged the anti-Japanese guerrilla units into the Korean People's Revolutionary Army. With the close cooperation of the Chinese people, he inflicted heavy blows on the Japanese imperialist invaders.

In May 1935, he organized the Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland, a broad anti-Japanese national united front organization with hundreds of thousands of members. Comrade Kim Il-sung was elected as its chairman. He creatively combined Marxism-Leninism with the reality of Korea and formulated and published the "Ten-Point Program of the Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland," which expounded the strategy and tactics of the Korean revolution.

Comrade Kim Il-sung's anti-Japanese armed struggle infinitely encouraged the Korean people's revolutionary struggle. He sent many personnel to various parts of the country to organize and guide the workers' movement and the national liberation struggle.

Through all these activities, Comrade Kim Il-sung cultivated many communist core members and laid the organizational and ideological foundation for the creation of a Marxist-Leninist party.

Comrade Kim Il-sung triumphantly returned to his homeland on August 15, 1945, with the liberation of the motherland by the Soviet army.

After liberation, Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out a clear line for the Korean revolution and organized and led the Korean people in their struggle for the democratic development of the motherland.

After the establishment of the North Korean Organizing Committee of the Korean Communist Party in October 1945, he was elected as its secretary, and later elected as the chairman of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea, established in February 1946.

In September 1948, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was founded, and he was appointed as the Premier of the Cabinet.

In July 1949, the North and South Korean Labor Parties merged, and he was elected as the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Labor Party.

At the beginning of the Fatherland Liberation War, Comrade Kim Il-sung served as the Chairman of the Military Commission and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, leading the entire Korean people and the Korean People's Army to victory in the war.

In February 1953, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded him the title of Marshal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

After the armistice, Comrade Kim Il-sung organized and led the entire Korean people to successfully carry out the post-war reconstruction of the people's economy. Today, he continues to lead the Korean people in their struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the construction of socialism in the northern half of the Republic.

The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded Comrade Kim Il-sung the title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Labor Hero for his outstanding achievements in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the motherland and the construction of socialism.
