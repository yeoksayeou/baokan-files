Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th. The National Ductile Iron Conference concluded in Shenyang on the 14th.

After listening to experience reports from twenty-one units and visiting the exhibition of China's great achievements in promoting ductile iron in recent years, the 480 representatives from factories, schools, and research departments across the country unanimously agreed that ductile iron has six major advantages: good performance, low cost, fast construction, easy to master, wide application, and great prospects. Promoting ductile iron is not only the most effective measure to implement the principle of "using iron instead of steel and casting instead of forging" in the machinery industry and to solve the current shortage of cast steel and forged steel, but also opens up new avenues for the long-term development of the machinery industry. The conference decided to greatly enhance the status of ductile iron, treat it as a regular industrial material, and apply it to various industrial sectors across the country. In the process of promotion, it is necessary to achieve "from less to more, from urban to rural, from point to area, from low to high, from strong to stronger, from single to diverse," and to make every effort to increase the production of ductile iron, so that the mechanical properties of ductile iron, which have already reached advanced levels, continue to develop to higher levels, and expand from casting to stamping, pressing, extrusion, drawing, welding, rolling, and other processes.

The conference believes that the current urgent need is to solve how to use indigenous iron to manufacture ductile iron, research new spheroidizing agents to replace the currently scarce magnesium, and find ways to stabilize the quality of ductile iron. On the last day of the conference, representatives from various regions formulated specific plans for promoting ductile iron and research topics, and enthusiastically launched friendly challenges and responses.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th. Ductile iron, known as a new world technology, has achieved tremendous development in China. Especially since the Great Leap Forward this year, China's foundry workers have liberated their minds, broken superstitions, and have used ductile iron to manufacture the world's first iron rail, the first seamless iron pipe, the first hot-rolled gear, the first cold-rolled sheet, the first all-iron lathe, the first all-iron high-speed diesel engine, the first batch of turbine and hydro-turbine impellers and spindles, etc., finding broad development prospects for the application of ductile iron.

At present, ductile iron in China is not only widely used in various machinery manufacturing, but has also gone beyond the field of machinery manufacturing and is being used in metallurgy, railways, transportation, construction and other industries. The rollers of various steel rolling mills that work under high temperatures and bear huge loads used to generally require nickel-chromium steel. Now, Anshan Iron and Steel has successfully manufactured them with ductile iron. The large rolling mill rolls weighing twenty-six tons made of ductile iron have better performance than alloy forged steel. China has rich experience in using ductile iron to cast crankshafts. In addition to the 600-horsepower diesel engine crankshaft manufactured by Dalian Shipyard, crankshafts for various other horsepower diesel engines, gasoline engines, air compressors, and donkey boilers have been mass-produced in many factories. The ductile iron high-pressure gate valve manufactured by Shanghai Petroleum Machinery Company was originally designed with a working pressure of 160 atmospheres, but reached 950 atmospheres during testing, setting an example for using ductile iron to manufacture high-pressure equipment. Even more exciting is that Tsinghua University has used ductile iron to cast various types of rails, which have been safely and undamaged after 15,000 runs. They have also successfully used ductile iron to manufacture 1,500 kW turbine spindles and impellers, replacing high-speed rotating forged steel parts, breaking the foreign-recognized limit that ductile iron parts cannot exceed 8 meters per second.

In terms of ductile iron manufacturing technology, China has also reached the world's advanced level. Now, China can not only master the spheroidization treatment of large castings, but also created the world's first method of adding molten iron to increase the temperature of molten iron and control the amount of residual spheroidizing agent—magnesium. Some units have reduced the amount of magnesium added to 0.07%, breaking the world record of 0.08%. As for the emerging ductile iron rolling, forging, calendering, and extrusion technologies, they are also the world's first. Great achievements have also been made in new spheroidizing agents and spheroidizing theories.

    把球墨铸铁当作正规材料
    各地试用证明：球墨铸铁用途广阔
    据新华社沈阳18日电　全国球墨铸铁会议14日在沈阳结束。
    来自全国各地工厂、学校、研究部门的四百八十名代表在会上听了二十一个单位的经验介绍，参观了我国几年来在推广球墨铸铁方面巨大成就的展览之后，一致认为球墨铸铁有性能好、成本低、建设快、掌握易、用途广、前途大等六大好处，推广球墨铸铁不仅是贯彻机械工业“以铁代钢、以铸代锻”，解决当前铸钢、锻钢供应不足的最有效措施，也为机械工业的长远发展开辟了新的途径。会议决定要大大提高球墨铸铁的身价，把它作为一种正规的工业材料，应用到全国各个工业部门中去。在推广过程中做到“由少到多，由城市到乡村，由点到面，由低到高，由强到更强，由单样到多样”，并千方百计地提高球墨铸铁的产量，使球墨铸铁的机械性能在已经达到先进水平的基础上，继续向更高的水平发展，并由铸扩展到冲、压、挤、拔、焊、轧等工艺方面。
    会议认为，当前急需解决的是如何利用土铁制造球墨铸铁，研究新的球化剂来代替现在供不应求的镁，并且设法稳定球墨铸铁的质量。在会议最后一天，各地代表都制定出了推广球墨铸铁的具体规划和研究的课题，热烈展开了友谊挑战、应战。
    据新华社沈阳18日电　被称为世界新技术的球墨铸铁，在我国获得巨大的发展。特别是自今年大跃进以来，我国铸造工作者解放思想、破除迷信，已经用球墨铸铁制造出世界上第一根铁轨、第一根无缝铁管、第一个热轧齿轮、第一片冷轧薄板、第一台全铁车床、第一台全铁高速柴油机、第一批汽轮机、水轮机的叶轮和主轴等，为球墨铸铁的应用找到了广阔的发展前途。
    目前，球墨铸铁在我国不仅广泛地运用于各种机械制造，并且已经超出了机械制造领域，被使用到冶金、铁路、交通、建筑等工业上去。在高温下工作并承受巨大负荷的各种轧钢机的轧辊，过去一般要求用镍铬钢制造，现在在鞍钢已成功地用球墨铸铁制造出来。他们用球墨铸铁制造的重二十六吨的初轧机大型轧辊，使用效果比合金锻钢还好。利用球墨铸铁铸造曲轴，在我国已经有了丰富的经验。除了大连造船厂制造出六百马力柴油机曲轴以外，其他各种马力的柴油机、汽油机、空气压缩机、锅驼机的曲轴已在许多工厂成批生产。上海石油机械公司制造的球墨铸铁高压闸门，原设计工作压力一百六十大气压，试验时曾达到了九百五十大气压，为利用球墨铸铁制造高压设备树立了榜样。更令人兴奋的是清华大学已经用球墨铸铁浇注各种类型的铁轨，经过一万五千次行车，安全无损。他们还成功地用球墨铸铁制造出了一千五百瓩汽轮机主轴和叶轮，代替了高速运转的锻钢件，打破了外国公认的球墨铸铁零件转速不能超过每秒八公尺的界限。
    在球墨铸铁制造技术上，我国也已达到世界先进水平。现在，我国不仅能够掌握大型铸件的球化处理，还创造了世界上过去没有的补加铁水方法，来提高铁水温度、控制残余的球化剂——镁的数量，有的单位已把加镁量减低到0.07％，打破了0.08％的世界纪录。至于已经出现的球墨铸铁轧制、锻造、压延和挤压技术，也是世界首创。在新的球化剂和球化理论方面也取得了很大成就。
