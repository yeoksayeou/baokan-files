Payment Based on Labor is the Foundation of China's Current Distribution System
He Tianzhong

The distribution system of "partial supply, partial wage" has become the main form of distribution in China's rural areas, which is a major reform of the distribution system. It is not only a reasonable distribution method that conforms to China's current level of productivity, but also contains elements of the communist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." Therefore, the broad masses enthusiastically support this new system. However, it is incorrect to think that changing the supply system to the wage system after liberation was a compromise and concession to bourgeois right, a regression, or even that it was the bourgeoisie protecting bourgeois right. I believe that the wage system of "payment based on labor" in the past promoted the development of production, and at present, the principle of payment based on labor is still the foundation of China's distribution system.

The Correctness of Implementing the Principle of Payment Based on Labor in the Past and the Inevitable Trend of Changing the Supply System to the Wage System

Distribution is a matter within the scope of production relations. It depends on class relations on the one hand, and more importantly on the development of productive forces; of course, it is also closely related to the level of social political thought, science, and culture. Although the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 marked the beginning of the socialist revolution, due to the backward old foundation and the serious damage of the war, the national financial and economic situation was very difficult at that time, and the large number of unemployment phenomena left over from the old society could not be solved immediately. The central task facing the people of the whole country was to develop production. At this time, not only was it impossible to universally implement the supply system, but the unreasonable wage system left over from the semi-colonial era could not be eliminated all at once, and the right to work could not be guaranteed. Until the completion of the socialist transformation in 1956, Chinese society had always been a situation in which five economies coexisted. The bourgeoisie and capitalist ownership still existed, and the wage system of private enterprises had not been thoroughly reformed. Therefore, in this historical period, vigorously promoting payment based on labor and more pay for more work not only conformed to the political and economic situation at that time, but also promoted the development of production in fact. If today, after rectification and communization, our task is to advocate an attitude of labor that does not count remuneration and to criticize bourgeois right ideology, then in the past when urban and rural capitalism existed, our task was precisely to criticize the capitalist ideology of not working and gaining without labor with the principle of payment based on labor, so as to establish the idea that labor is glorious. Therefore, the correctness of implementing the wage system in the past is beyond doubt. As for the current "partial supply, partial wage" system implemented in China, it must first be recognized that it is the product of the all-people rectification and Great Leap Forward since 1957, and the high-speed development of China's productive forces and the unprecedented improvement of people's awareness. Without this development situation, there is no point in talking about the "partial supply, partial wage" system. Even today, after communization, whether from the perspective of production conditions or political conditions, it is still necessary to retain a certain proportion of the wage part, otherwise it will not be conducive to the development of production. Since what is implemented today is still a partial supply system, what is there to criticize about changing the supply system for a few people to a salary system a few years ago? As for the original supply system being regarded as a red flag and the idea that the two systems coexist, although it has its advantages and positive effects, it may not have been perfect for the historical conditions at that time. The supply system at that time was first implemented in the revolutionary base areas during the war when materials were scarce. Its main characteristics were: first, small differences, and second, low supply standards and hard living. The revolutionary comrades at that time all abandoned their family burdens and lived a military combat life. The scope of activities was mainly rural areas and small and medium-sized cities, and the main problems people thought about were defeating the reactionaries and Japanese imperialism. After liberation, they entered big cities and began peaceful economic construction. The living standards in cities were high, and people's needs were also diversified. It was really inconvenient to still focus on material supply at this time, so they had to change the original supply system to a contract system. In addition, after liberation, many cadres' parents and children came to the door, and many people had no means of living, so of course, the public would be responsible for supporting them. However, if all these problems of the new and old comrades were borne by the public, the state would have financial difficulties, so it would not be able to take care of everything. In addition, there were also problems between cadres with the supply system and the salary system. At that time, some people had different views on people with the supply system and people with the salary system. At the same time, there were many inconveniences in management work, and there were more or less contradictions with the economic accounting system of enterprises. After the supply system was changed to the contract system, it was essentially a low-wage system (its reasonable factor was based on population), so in the end, it was an inevitable trend to change the supply system to a salary system. The so-called inevitability does not absolutize the problem; it does not mean that retaining the supply system is completely impossible and has no benefits. If one could have foreseen the development of today's Great Leap Forward and communization, and tried to solve some of the problems of the original supply system to adapt it to the new situation, it might have been more beneficial than harmful, but few people could come up with a reasonable supply system plan suitable for the period from after the founding of the country to before 1958 (the army's supply system should indeed be retained). Marxism-Leninism has far-reaching scientific foresight, but it cannot completely predict specific events. Looking back from the timetable of 1958, it is naturally clear at a glance; looking at the aftermath from before the event, there are not so many Zhuge Liangs. Without summing up history, one cannot learn lessons, but summing up history must fully grasp historical materialism and be good at distinguishing between nine fingers and one finger.

The Past Mistake Was That It Did Not Promote the Equal Spirit of the Supply System, Implemented a Low-Wage System, and Expanded Wage Differences, Which Promoted Economism and Individualism

Acknowledging the correctness of implementing the principle of payment based on labor in the past and changing the supply system to the wage system does not mean denying the shortcomings and mistakes of the past. On the contrary, if one cannot correctly recognize mistakes, one cannot advance in the distribution system. The main mistake in the past was to absolutize and sanctify the principle of payment based on labor, regarding it as the only distribution law of socialist society. It neither recognized the relative inequality of bourgeois right contained in the principle of payment based on labor from the perspective of the communist distribution principle; nor did it realize that the communist distribution principle would sprout and grow in socialist society, and mistakenly believed that it would be many years before talking about the communist distribution principle in China. This is precisely a metaphysical view. Therefore, there cannot but be deviations and errors in work. For example, excessive emphasis on the principle of material incentives; excessive beautification of the piece-rate wage system; excessive emphasis on opposing egalitarianism, expanding wage differences, and so on. This could not but neglect political command to a certain extent, and in some respects promote economism and individualism in people's minds. In dealing with the supply system, it was indeed not with the attitude of combining Marxism-Leninism with Chinese practice to sum up its advantages and experiences. On the contrary, it emphasized that it had the shortcomings of egalitarianism. In this way, not only could the fine tradition of the communist spirit of equality in China's long-term revolution not be fully promoted; but it was bound to take the road of expanding wage differences. Our mistake was not in changing the supply system to the wage system, but in not starting from 600 million people when changing, implementing a low-wage system; in not absorbing the communist spirit of equality of the supply system; in excessively emphasizing opposition to egalitarianism and neglecting the unreasonableness of high and low disparity. In these respects, it cannot be said that it was bound and influenced by the thought of bourgeois right. Although we implemented the principles with communist factors in the additional wage part accounting for more than ten percent of the total wage in terms of medical care, labor insurance, and welfare, this was ultimately not the main aspect. Therefore, we must learn lessons from the mistakes and errors of the past. The basic reason for this problem is inseparable from our low level of political thought, lack of foresight in politics, and even dogmatic thinking methods.

The Principle of Payment Based on Labor Still Plays a Role in Promoting Production

In the process of discussing bourgeois right and exploring the supply system, the arguments of some comrades essentially deny the progressive role that the principle of payment based on labor still has at present and in the future for a certain period of time. For example, criticizing the wage system for forming "contending for fame in the court and contending for profit in the market"; equating the wage system with the rank system; mythologizing the supply system, advocating unlimited expansion of the supply ratio, and believing that the more is contracted, the better, and so on. We believe that since distribution is subordinate to the development of productive forces, since today's products are not rich enough, social differences still exist, and people's consciousness lacks a complete communist system, then today we cannot but retain part of the wage system. Therefore, the distribution law of payment based on labor will still play a role in promoting production.

From the communist point of view, in terms of the principle of payment based on labor, we must point out its inequality; and call on people to fight for the highest communist principles. But in the first stage of communism, since this inequality is an objective reflection and an inevitable historical process, we cannot but admit its relative rationality. Whether in the past, today, or even in the short term, it is difficult to level the material life of experts and professors with ordinary workers all at once. As for confusing the wage differences under the socialist system with the rank system of the exploiting class society, it is even more wrong. Although the two still have some similarities in form, and we still use the term "wage", the two are essentially different. One is a distribution system based on equal labor and measured by labor after the elimination of exploitation, and the other is a system of exploitation of man by man based on private ownership of the means of production. The style of "superior Chinese and Master Zhao", as well as the phenomenon of "contending for fame in the court and contending for profit in the market", has always been a problem for a few people. How can there be none of such people during the supply system period? When analyzing the ideological roots, Marxists and Leninists have always started from the class roots. The idea of fame and profit is a bourgeois idea, which exists in people who come from exploiting class families and have not been well reformed, and exists in people who have been invaded by bourgeois ideas.

When the supply system was changed to the salary system in the past, one-sidedness occurred, and we cannot repeat the old path today. If today we still do not recognize the communist factors in the supply system, and do not recognize that the principle of payment based on labor has the nature of bourgeois right, we cannot move forward; but overestimating the role of the supply system in history cannot completely help the future either. The supply system during the revolutionary war was only a military communist life system, not a distribution method linked to production. Although the past supply system and today's supply system have a common communist spirit of equality, it is not a simple historical repetition. The past supply system contributed to overcoming financial difficulties; to revolutionary unity; and to cultivating people's communist spirit; but it could only play an auxiliary role in the victory of the revolution. Today's supply system is still a limited distribution, and can only be a form of communist sprout and transition to the communist distribution principle. Although this system is a more reasonable form that is a step forward than the wage system of payment based on labor, it is also necessary to prevent some possible negative effects from occurring in the implementation. If political work cannot keep up, there may be phenomena such as family members entering the city, and a few people becoming negative due to reduced income. Although these can only be a few people, they cannot be ignored. Therefore, overemphasizing the role of the supply system and overemphasizing the role of payment based on labor in developing production are both separated from political command. Today, people often oppose the principle of payment based on labor to political command. This is not the case. The distribution law of the socialist stage proposed by Marx and affirmed by Lenin is not in principle opposed to political command. Political command is the prerequisite, but today we cannot do without a little material encouragement. Even in the past supply system period, it was opposed to egalitarianism. Some people see the workers' communist labor attitude of not counting remuneration and not counting time after the Great Leap Forward, especially after the abolition of piece-rate wages, and think that the principle of material incentives no longer has any effect. This is incorrect. The workers and peasants do not count time and do not count remuneration because of the domination of the great communist ideal, and they have made some sacrifices for material interests, but it does not mean that there are no material interests. Denying people's concern for material life can only be idealism. If the supply system is contracted too much, not only is it impossible in fact due to the limitations of the production level, but it is also a manifestation of being divorced from people's ideological level. People's lives are diversified, and there is still currency and commodity circulation today. Contracting too much is not conducive to promoting production, nor is it conducive to commodity circulation. The result is only to make people feel inconvenient (of course, it is another matter when products are abundant). At the same time, it is very easy to fall into egalitarianism and fall into the mire of production raids and equal remuneration. Stalin once pointed out: "That all people receive the same wages, the same amount of meat, the same amount of bread, wear the same clothes, and receive the same and the same amount of products—such socialism is unknown to Marxism." (Stalin: "Conversation with the German writer Emil Ludwig")

The main purpose of our discussion of bourgeois right today is to weaken it, criticize it, and open up the road for new forms of distribution system, rather than to eliminate it immediately. Communists who are not enthusiastic about the communist direction of the distribution system are not true communists. But people must be clear in their minds: the principle of payment based on labor can only be gradually weakened with the development of production in the future, until it is finally replaced by the communist principle. The current and future tasks in the field of distribution will be: to ensure people's basic living needs by promoting the half-supply and half-wage system, to continuously narrow the differences, to continuously expand the proportion of the supply system, to expand people's economic equality, so as to strengthen the unity of 600 million people, and to make production relations further adapt to the productive forces.

### 按劳付酬是我国目前分配制度的基础

专栏：关于资产阶级法权问题的讨论

    按劳付酬是我国目前分配制度的基础
    贺天中
    部分供给部分工资的分配制度，目前在我国的农村已成为主要的分配形式，这是分配制度的重大改革。它不仅是符合我国目前生产力水平的合理分配方式，而且包含了共产主义各取所需的因素，因此广大群众都热情地拥护这一新制度。但是，如果因此认为解放后把供给制改为工资制是对资产阶级法权的妥协让步，是倒退，甚至认为这是资产阶级为了保护资产阶级法权，却是不对的。我认为过去由供给制改为“按劳付酬”的工资制促进了生产的发展，而且在当前，按劳付酬原则仍然是我国分配制度的基础。
    过去贯彻按劳付酬原则的正确性和供给制改工资制的必然趋势
    分配是属于生产关系范畴的问题，它一方面取决于阶级关系，一方面更主要的是取决于生产力的发展；当然也与社会政治思想、科学文化的发展水平密切相关联。1949年中华人民共和国的成立虽然标志了社会主义革命的开始，但由于旧有基础落后和战争的严重破坏，当时国家财政经济十分困难，旧社会遗留下来的大量失业现象不能立即解决，摆在全国人民面前的中心任务是发展生产。这时不仅普遍实行供给制问题无从提起，就是半殖民地遗留下来的不合理的工资制度也无法一下子消除，劳动权也无法保证。直到1956年社会主义改造完成以前，中国社会一直是五种经济并存的局面，资产阶级和资本主义所有制仍然存在，私营企业的工资制度也没有彻底改革。因此在这一历史时期，大力提倡按劳付酬、多劳多得，不仅符合当时的政治经济情况，事实上也促进了生产的发展。如果说经过整风和公社化的今天，我们的任务是提倡不计报酬的劳动态度，批判资产阶级法权思想，那么在存在城乡资本主义的过去，我们的任务恰恰是以按劳付酬原则来批判不劳而获的资本主义思想，以此来树立劳动光荣的思想。因此过去实行工资制的正确性是不容置疑的。至于目前我国实行的部分供给部分工资制，首先要认识到它是经过1957年以来的全民整风和大跃进，是我国生产力高速度发展，人民觉悟空前提高后的产物。离开这一发展形势，就谈不到什么部分供给部分工资制。即使是公社化后的今天，无论从生产条件或政治条件来说，都还需要保留一定比重的工资部分，否则就不利于生产的发展。既然今天实行的还是部分供给制，那么在几年前将少数人的供给制改为薪金制又有什么可以非议呢？至于将原有供给制作为红旗，两种制度并存的主张，虽然有其优点和积极作用，但对当时历史条件来说，也未必就完美无缺。那时的供给制，首先是在战争时期革命根据地物资缺乏的情况下实行的，其主要特点：一是差别小，二是供给标准低，生活艰苦。当时的革命同志都是抛开身家之累，过着军事战斗生活，活动范围主要是乡村和中小城市，人们的头脑中思考的主要问题是战胜反动派和日本帝国主义。解放后进入了大城市，开始了和平的经济建设，城市生活水平高，人们的需要也多样化了，这时仍以实物供给为主确有许多不便，因此不得不将原来的供给制改为包干制。另外，解放后不少干部的父母子女找上门来，不少人生活无着落，这样当然就要由公家负责供养。但新老同志的这些问题全部由公家负担，国家财政上有困难，所以也就无法全部照顾。此外，供给制、薪金制干部之间也不是没有问题的，当时有若干人对供给制人员和薪金制人员存在不同看法，同时在管理工作上也有许多不便之处，与企业的经济核算制也或多或少的存在矛盾。在供给制改为包干制后，实质上已经变成了低工资制（其合理因素是按人口），所以在最后将供给制改为薪金制已是不可避免的趋势。所谓不可避免并不是把问题绝对化；也并不是说保留供给制完全不行和没有好处。如果能预料到今天的跃进和公社化的发展，而设法解决原有供给制的一些问题，使之适应新情况，也可能利多弊少，但很少有人能谈出适合建国以后到1958年以前的合理的供给制方案（军队供给制确该保留）。马列主义是具有远大科学预见性的，但并不能完全预料具体事态，站在1958年的时间表上看过去，自然了如指掌；从事前看事后，就没有那么多的诸葛亮。不总结历史不能吸收教训，但总结历史必须充分掌握历史唯物主义，要善于区分九个指头和一个指头。
    过去的错误在于没有发扬供给制的平等精神，实行低工资制，而扩大了工资的差别，助长了经济主义和个人主义
    承认过去贯彻按劳付酬原则和改供给制为工资制的正确性，并不是否认过去的缺点和错误，反之，如果不能正确认识错误，也就不能在分配制度上前进。过去主要的错误是把按劳付酬的原则绝对化和神圣化了，把它看成是社会主义社会的唯一分配规律。既没有从共产主义分配原则来认识按劳付酬原则所包含的资产阶级法权的相对不平等性；又没有认识到共产主义分配原则会在社会主义社会萌芽成长，而错误的认为在中国谈共产主义分配原则，起码是许多年以后的事。这正是形而上学的观点。因此在工作上就不能不出偏差和错误。如过分强调了物质鼓励原则；过分美化了计件工资制，过分强调了反对平均主义，扩大了工资差别等等。这就不能不在一定程度上忽视政治挂帅，并在某些方面助长了人们思想中的经济主义和个人主义思想。在对待供给制问题上的确也没有以马克思列宁主义和中国实践相结合的态度去总结它的优点和经验，反之却强调它有平均主义的缺点。这样不仅不能充分发扬我国长期革命中共产主义平等精神的优良传统；而且必然走上扩大工资差别的道路。我们的错误不在于供给制改工资制，而在于改的时候没有从六亿人口出发，实行低工资制；在于没有吸收供给制的共产主义平等精神；在于过分强调了反对平均主义，忽略了高低悬殊的不合理。在这些方面不能不说是受了资产阶级法权思想的束缚和影响。虽然，我们在占工资总额百分之十几的附加工资部分中，在医疗、劳保、福利等方面实行了带有共产主义因素的原则，但这终非主要方面。因此必须从过去的缺点和错误中吸收教训。产生这一问题的基本原因，是与我们政治思想水平不高，在政治上缺乏远见，以至教条主义的思想方法分不开的。
    按劳付酬的分配原则目前还起着促进生产的作用
    在讨论资产阶级法权和探讨供给制的过程中，若干同志的论点实质上是否定了按劳付酬原则在当前和在今后一定时期仍然具有的进步作用。如指责工资制形成了“争名于朝，争利于市”；把工资制和等级制等量齐观；神化供给制，主张无限扩大供给比重，认为包的越多越好等等。我们认为既然分配从属于生产力的发展，既然今天的产品还不丰富，还存在社会差别，人们的意识又缺乏完整的共产主义体系，那么今天就不能不保留部分工资制。因之按劳付酬的分配规律就还会起着促进生产的作用。
    从共产主义观点来看按劳付酬这一原则，我们必须指出它的不平等；号召人们为共产主义最高原则而奋斗。但在共产主义的第一阶段，这种不平等既然是客观存在的反映，又是不可避免的历史过程，就不能不承认它的相对合理性。无论过去和今天以至短暂的将来，把专家、教授的物质生活和普通工人一下子拉平，都难于行得通。至于把社会主义制度下的工资差别和剥削阶级社会的等级制混为一谈，更是不对。尽管二者形式上还有某些相同，我们还沿用了“工资”的名词，但二者本质不同。一个是消灭了剥削后以平等劳动为基础，以劳动为尺度的分配制度，一个是以私人占有生产资料为基础的人剥削人的分配制度。“高等华人和赵太爷”作风，以及“争名于朝，争利于市”的现象，始终是少数人的问题，这种人在供给制时期又何尝一个没有？马列主义者分析思想根源时，历来都是从阶级根源说起，名利思想是资产阶级思想，它存在于出身于剥削阶级家庭而未改造好的人身上，存在于受了资产阶级思想侵袭的人的身上。
    过去由供给制改薪金制时，曾产生片面性，今天就不能再走老路。如果今天我们还认识不到供给制中的共产主义因素，认识不到按劳付酬原则中有资产阶级法权的性质，我们就不能前进；但是过高地估计供给制在历史上的作用，也不能完全有助于将来。革命战争时期的供给制只是一种军事共产主义生活制度，并不是与生产联带的一种分配方式。过去的供给制与今天的供给制虽有一脉相通的共产主义平等精神，但并不是简单的历史重复。过去的供给制对克服财政困难；对革命团结；对培养人们共产主义精神是有功绩的；但对革命胜利也只能起着辅助性作用。今天的供给制仍然是有限额的分配，只能是共产主义的萌芽和向共产主义分配原则过渡的形式。这种制度虽然较之按劳付酬的工资制是前进了一步的合理的形式，但在执行中也要防止发生某些可能发生的消极作用。如果政治工作跟不上，就有可能出现家属进城，少数人由于降低收入而消极等等现象。这些虽然只能是少数人，但并不能忽视。所以过分强调供给制的作用和过分强调按劳付酬对发展生产的作用，都是离开了政治挂帅。今天人们谈到按劳付酬原则往往把它和政治挂帅对立。事实并非如此。为马克思所提出并为列宁所肯定的社会主义阶段的分配规律，并不是在原则上就与政治挂帅相对立的。政治挂帅是前提，但今天不能不要一点物质鼓励。即或在过去的供给制时期，也是反对平均主义的。有人看到大跃进后尤其是取消计件工资后工人的不计报酬、不计时间的共产主义劳动态度，就认为物质鼓励原则再没有作用了，这是不正确的。工人和农民的不计时间、不计报酬，是由于伟大共产主义理想的支配，对物质利益作了某些牺牲，并不是没有了物质利益的问题。否认人们对物质生活的关怀只能是唯心主义。供给制包的太多，不但因生产水平所限，事实上办不到，也是脱离了人们的思想水平的表现。人们的生活是多样化的，今天还存在着货币和商品流通，包死了既不利于促进生产，也不利于商品流转，结果只是使人感到不便（当然产品丰富时又当别论）。同时这样极易陷入平均主义，陷入生产突击、报酬平等的泥坑。斯大林曾指出：“所有的人都领取同样的工资、同等数量的肉、同等数量的面包，穿同样的衣服，领取同样的和同等数量的产品，——这种社会主义是马克思主义所不知道的”。（斯大林：“和德国作家艾尔米·路德维希的谈话”）
    我们今天讨论资产阶级法权的主要目的，是削弱它、批判它，为新形式的分配制度开拓道路，而不是马上要消灭它。共产党人如果不热心于分配制度的走向共产主义，就不是真正的共产主义者。但是人们必须在思想上明确：按劳付酬原则在今后只能是随着生产的发展而逐步削弱，以致最终为共产主义原则所代替。在分配领域内当前和今后的任务将是：通过推行半供给半工资制，保证人们基本生活需要，不断缩小差别，不断扩大供给制比重，扩大人们在经济上的平等，以加强六亿人民的团结，使生产关系进一步适应生产力。
