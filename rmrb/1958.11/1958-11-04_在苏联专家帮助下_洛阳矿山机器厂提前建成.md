    Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 3rd November. China's first modern Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant, equipped with the latest technology, has been completed ahead of schedule. The National Acceptance Committee, after inspection, found that the quality of all projects was excellent and approved the plant to be officially put into production on November 1st.
    The Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant is one of the key projects designed with Soviet assistance. Once put into production, it will be able to produce a series of complete sets of equipment for steelmaking, ironmaking, steel rolling, and mining. Construction of this factory began in December 1955, and the construction time was a quarter ahead of the original plan. In July of this year, the plant comprehensively began trial production and has already manufactured nine 2.5-meter hoists, sixteen rolling mills, and a total of 134 units of 20 other products. It is expected that the cumulative output of the entire plant by the end of this year will reach the designed level.
    On November 1st, all employees of the plant held a grand ceremony to celebrate the start of production. Li Li, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee and Chairman of the National Acceptance Committee, Jiang Zemin, Assistant Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, and others spoke at the meeting.
    Skoptsov, representative of the Soviet Foreign Economic Liaison Bureau, congratulated China on putting another modern machine manufacturing plant into production on behalf of all Soviet experts. Raourusin, the head of the resident expert group, said that he would work with all employees to complete the more glorious and arduous production tasks assigned by the Chinese Party and the state for next year, based on the tremendous achievements already made.

    The Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant started trial production of new products during construction. This is the metalworking workshop installing a 2.5-meter hoist. These three hoists, which have absorbed the advanced design of Soviet hoist manufacturing for many years, are suitable for mines with an annual output of 200,000 to 300,000 tons.

    在苏联专家帮助下
    洛阳矿山机器厂提前建成
    据新华社洛阳3日电　我国第一座具有最新技术装备的现代化的洛阳矿山机器厂，已经提前全部建成。国家验收委员会经过验收，认为全部工程质量优良，批准这个厂在11月1日正式投入生产。
    洛阳矿山机器厂是苏联帮助我国设计的重点工程之一，投入生产后能够生产炼钢、炼铁、轧钢、采矿等一系列的成套设备。这座工厂从1955年12月开始建厂，到正式投入生产，建设时间比原计划提前了一个季度。在今年7月，这个厂就全面开始试生产，已经制造出九台两公尺五的卷扬机，十六台轧钢机，以及其他二十种产品共一百三十四台。预计全厂到今年年底，累计产量就将达到设计水平。
    11月1日，全厂职工隆重举行了开工生产典礼仪式。中共河南省委书记处书记、国家验收委员会主任委员李立、第一机械工业部部长助理江泽民等，都在会上讲了话。
    苏联对外经济联络局代表斯柯普佐夫代表全体苏联专家，祝贺我国又一个现代化的机器制造厂投入生产。驻厂专家组长拉乌鲁辛表示，他将和全厂职工共同在已经取得巨大成就的基础上，全力完成中国党和国家所交给的明年的更加光荣和艰巨的生产任务。（附图片）
