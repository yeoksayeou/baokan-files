    Rat-Free Port - Dalian Port
    By our reporter Cao Zhixian
    Dalian Port has created a rare miracle in the world's shipping industry: the vast port, stretching for more than ten li, has now become a "rat-free port." In the rat-free Dalian Port, there has not been a single incident of rats damaging goods or spoiling grain in the past two years. In the past, large areas of grassland in the port were inhabited by rat colonies. Now, it is difficult to find any trace of rat activity in the open-air debris piles and food storage warehouses.
    As everyone knows, ports are filled with warehouses, and grain is piled high, making them ideal places for rats to live. With this favorable living environment, the rat's reproductive capacity is even more alarming. According to dockworkers' recollections, in the past, Dalian Port suffered severely from rats. Rats would run out of their holes during the day and walk around the warehouses in a grand manner. After liberation, Dalian Port continuously exterminated rats, and the rat plague decreased year by year, but there were still many rats.
    Opening Fire on Rats
    In 1956, a fierce annihilation war against rats began in Dalian Port! Professional rat extermination groups and mass rat situation intelligence networks were combined to form a dragnet for the rats. The rat extermination groups divided the port into many rat extermination zones. In each small zone, densely laid out were arrays of thousands of rat traps. They used a "large sweep" method to "sweep" through all areas several times.
    The mass intelligence network was even more ubiquitous, covering every corner of the harbor. Any stevedore who discovered a rat situation would immediately report it to the rat extermination group by telephone. Experienced workers would rush to the scene like investigators. These rats were all seasoned veterans, extremely cunning creatures that could jump over rat traps without getting caught. Baits soaked in poison were placed in rat holes, but the rats could smell the poison and would starve themselves or push the bait out of the hole.
    However, no matter how cunning the rats were, the experienced workers of the rat extermination group, relying on the masses, came up with many clever tricks and successfully lured the rats into the maze. Based on the rat's habit of moving along walls, the experienced workers sprinkled white ash at the base of the walls. Upon discovering rat footprints, they would track them to the rat hole. They used two rat traps side by side to block the entrance of the hole, making it impossible for the rats to escape when they came out. They fried hemp seeds and flour into fragrant bait that the rats found especially tempting. They also rotated the use of many different poisons, changing the taste frequently, so the rats could not detect any flaws.
    The number of rats in Dalian Port decreased more and more. Many rat extermination zones designated by the experienced workers now couldn't even catch a single rat. Even in the grain and food warehouses, the most suitable places for rats to live, only one or two rats could be caught occasionally after a long period.
    Rat-Free Ships
    Every ship belonging to Dalian Port cherishes the title of "rat-free port." The crew and sailors, fearing that a rat might suddenly appear on their ship and tarnish the reputation of "rat-free port," have all waged a sweeping battle against rats on board, using cages, traps, poisons, and poisoned bait, to thoroughly eliminate the rats. What if rats secretly boarded the ship while loading cargo in other ports? The sailors have a full set of rat-catching tools on board, waiting for them. When the ships are sailing quietly in the sea, the sailors often take flashlights to search for signs of rats in every corner. Once, on the voyage from Qingdao to Dalian on the passenger ship "Democracy No. 9," a small rat was discovered. The sailors immediately followed the rat's footprints, found the rat hole, and then set up a dragnet of traps and cages at the entrance of the hole and on the rat's necessary route of entry and exit, eliminating the last remaining rats on the ship. As soon as the ship docks at other ports and lowers the mooring lines, the sailors immediately install circular rat guards made of iron plates on the high part of the ship's cables to prevent rats from climbing up the cables and getting on board. Now, every ship belonging to Dalian Port, no matter which port it returns from, the sailors can pat their chests and proudly say to Dalian Port: Our ship is a "rat-free ship."
    Foreign Rats Forbidden to Land
    On May 29 this year, a West German merchant ship, the "Leipzig," arrived at Dalian Port from Kobe, Japan. At the inspection anchorage not far from the dock, staff from the Dalian Quarantine Office discovered rat droppings in the general cargo warehouse in the forepeak of the ship. After the ship docked, quarantine personnel boarded the ship and placed rat-catching cages in the forepeak. Before the "Leipzig" weighed anchor and left port, quarantine personnel Li Fuben disembarked from the ship carrying a European roof rat caught on board. The old captain, Skrlinwelt, stood on the bridge and gave Li Fuben a thumbs up, expressing his gratitude.
    Since 1956, Dalian Port has helped merchant ships from more than a dozen countries to clear rats from their ships free of charge. On July 11 last year, the Norwegian merchant ship "Corona" arrived at Dalian Port from Egypt carrying cotton. Chinese quarantine personnel found traces of rats in five or six cargo holds. After the ship docked, quarantine personnel placed one hundred and fifty rat traps in these cargo holds and caught one hundred and twenty-six Egyptian cotton mice within two days.
    Now, foreign merchant ships entering the port must, in accordance with the regulations of Dalian Port, hang rat guards on the ship's cables and raise the gangplank at night. When working at night, the gangplank must also be illuminated with strong lights to make the rats fearful and unwilling to land.
    The fact that Dalian Port has become a "rat-free port" is admired by the captains of some British and Japanese merchant ships. They have been to many countries' seaports. They said: In the ports of some countries, flies crash straight into your head as soon as you get off the ship, let alone eliminating rats.

    无鼠港——大连港
    本报记者　曹志贤
    大连港创造了世界海运业中一个罕见的奇迹：连绵十多华里长的巨大海港，今天已经成为“无鼠港”了。无鼠的大连港，两年来没有发生过一件老鼠咬坏货物，糟蹋粮食的事情。港内过去鼠群野居的大片草地，露天的杂物堆和储存食物的仓库里，现在很难再发现一点老鼠活动的迹象了。
    大家知道，港口仓库林立，粮食成堆，是老鼠栖居的好地方。老鼠有了这个良好的生活环境，繁殖能力就更加惊人了。据码头工人回忆，过去，大连港鼠患严重，老鼠白天也跑出洞来，在仓库里大模大样地走动。解放后，大连港不断地灭鼠，鼠祸逐年减少了，但老鼠还是不少。
    向老鼠开火
    1956年，一场向老鼠猛烈进攻的歼灭战，在大连港开始了！专业性的除鼠组和群众性的鼠情情报网结合起来，给老鼠布成了一个天罗地网。除鼠组把港内划分许多除鼠区。每个不大的区里，密集地布下了上千个鼠夹组成的阵地。他们用“大扫荡”的办法，把所有地方巡迴“扫荡”了好几遍。
    群众性情报网更是遍布海港的各个角落，任何一个装卸工人，一旦发现鼠情，就立刻用电话报告除鼠组。老工人闻讯后就会像侦察员一样赶到现场。些这老鼠，都是饱经风险，异常机警的家伙，它们走近鼠夹，一跃跳过，硬是不上圈套。毒药浸过的诱饵塞进了鼠洞，老鼠嗅出了药味，就会绝食，或者把诱饵从洞里推出来。
    可是，不管老鼠多么狡猾，除鼠组老工人依靠群众，想出了许多巧计妙策，还是把老鼠引进了迷宫。老工人们根据老鼠的习性是沿墙走动，就在墙脚下撒上白灰，发现鼠脚印，就追踪到鼠洞口。他们用两个鼠夹并排堵在洞口，老鼠出洞躲也躲不过去。他们用麻籽和面粉炸成香喷喷的诱饵，老鼠特别容易上钩。他们还轮换地使用好多种毒药，药味经常变化，老鼠就识不出一点破绽。
    大连港的老鼠越打越少了。老工人划分的许多除鼠区，现在甚至连一个老鼠也打不到了。即使在最适合老鼠生存的粮食、食品仓库里，很长时期内也只能偶然打到一、两只老鼠。
    无鼠船
    属于大连港的每一艘轮船都非常珍视“无鼠港”的称号。船员和水手们唯恐自己的船上忽然跑出来一只老鼠，会玷污“无鼠港”的荣誉，都曾经在船上用笼子、夹子、毒药、毒饵等对老鼠进行过一场扫荡战，彻底清除了船上的老鼠。轮船在别的港口装货时，老鼠偷偷上了船怎么办？水手们在船上有全套扑鼠工具，等待着它们。轮船在大海里，静静行驶的时候，水手们经常拿着手电筒在各个角落搜索老鼠的迹象。有一次，民主九号客轮在青岛到大连的航行途中，发现了一只小老鼠。水手们立刻沿着老鼠走过的脚印，找到了鼠洞，接着就在洞口和老鼠进进出出必经的路上，用夹子、笼子布下了天罗地网，消灭了船上最后的一小撮老鼠。轮船在其他港口一靠码头，放下缆索，水手们立刻在船缆的高处安上铁板做的圆形防鼠挡，不让老鼠爬上缆索，混到船上来。现在，属于大连港的每一艘轮船，不管从那个港口开回来，水手们都能拍着胸脯，自豪地对大连港说：我们的船是“无鼠船”。
    外国老鼠禁止登岸
    今年5月29日，一艘西德商船“来普在克”号从日本神户港驶抵大连港。在距离码头不远的检查抛锚地，大连检疫所的工作人员在这艘轮船前尖舱的杂物仓库里发现了鼠粪。轮船靠岸后，检疫人员上船把扑鼠笼子放在前尖舱里。“来普在克”号起锚离港前，检疫人员李辅本拿着船上捕到的欧洲屋顶鼠，从船上下岸时，老船长司克林威尔脱站在舵楼上对李辅本翘起大拇指，表示感谢。
    大连港1956年以来帮助过十多个国家的商船免费清除了船上的老鼠。去年7月11日挪威商船“柯罗那”号，从埃及运载棉花驶抵大连港。我国检疫人员在五、六个货舱里，都发现了鼠迹。船靠岸后，检疫人员在这些货舱里放下了一百五十个打鼠夹，两天内就打到了一百二十六只埃及的棉花小鼠。
    现在，驶进港口的外国商船，按照大连港的规定，必须在船缆上挂防鼠挡，晚上收起跳板。在夜间作业时，跳板上也必须用强烈的灯光照射，使老鼠望而生畏，不敢登岸。
    大连港成为“无鼠港”，一些英国和日本商船的船长很钦佩。他们曾经到过许多国家的海港。他们说：在有些国家的港口，一下了船苍蝇直撞脑袋，更不用说消灭老鼠了。
