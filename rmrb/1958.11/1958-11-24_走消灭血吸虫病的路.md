    Walking the Path of Eliminating Schistosomiasis

    The Work of Eliminating Schistosomiasis Advances from Victory to Victory
    "People die and no one carries the coffin, every family cries in sorrow, houses collapse and fields lie barren, relatives do not visit." This is a folk song circulating in Baoshan County, Shanghai, depicting the desolate scene in areas where schistosomiasis is rampant. Schistosomiasis is a major scourge for the broad masses of people in the southern provinces of China. It is widespread, covering 350 counties (cities) in twelve provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Shanghai. Nearly ten million people are infected, and the population at risk of infection is over one hundred million. Schistosomiasis not only harms humans but also poses a great threat to livestock, especially draught cattle, which are more susceptible to infection. According to incomplete statistics, among the 132,187 draught cattle surveyed in 118 counties and cities in the twelve provinces and cities, the highest infection rate was over 52%. It is estimated that about one to one and a half million draught cattle are infected with schistosomiasis nationwide. According to the survey's extrapolation, the loss of labor force due to sick cattle in the endemic areas is more than one-third, which is a significant loss to agricultural production.

    Over the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, the schistosomiasis prevention and control work has fully mobilized the masses, implemented active prevention and control, adopted comprehensive measures, combined mass movements with science and technology, and integrated prevention and control work with production, adhering to the correct policy of repeated visits to the countryside. The achievements have been enormous. As of the end of September this year, more than 3.5 million patients have been cured, of which 2.88 million were cured from January to June this year. In the past few years, more than 471 million square meters of snails have been eliminated, accounting for 57.3% of the snail-infested area nationwide. Fecal management has been carried out in 2,710 townships, accounting for 62.9% of the townships that should be managed. Protective measures are becoming a habit in people's lives. This year, more than 600,000 people from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui and other provinces went to endemic areas to harvest lake grass. Due to the good protective work, infection was basically avoided. After several years of efforts, 171 counties and cities and 2,183 townships have basically eliminated schistosomiasis nationwide. More counties, cities and provinces that have eliminated schistosomiasis are constantly emerging.

    The Path of Experts Becomes Narrower and Narrower, Eventually Leading to a Dead End
    The work of eliminating schistosomiasis over the past few years has developed in the struggle between two lines. One is the Party's line, the mass line; the other is the expert line. Because the Party's line has won, the work of eliminating schistosomiasis has been successful.

    Some bourgeois experts in the medical and health field believe that schistosomiasis cannot be eliminated and can only be controlled at most. They believe that controlling schistosomiasis is a scientific and technological issue, and scientific and technological issues can only be solved by science and technology. Only they are "experts," the Party is an "outsider," and the masses are ignorant and incompetent. Therefore, they do not want the Party's leadership and do not believe in the power of the masses. They base their arguments on world literature, which in their view is the golden rule and cannot be broken. They say that even capitalist countries with more developed science, such as Britain and the United States, cannot eliminate schistosomiasis. For example, Japan has only eight prefectures with snails and more than 33,000 patients. To eliminate snails, the rice field ditches are built with cement, and vigorous prevention and control have been carried out for forty years, but it has still not been eliminated. China has one of the largest number of patients, the largest distribution of snails, and the widest range of sources of infection in the world. In addition, its science and culture are backward, and its economy is underdeveloped. Trying to eliminate schistosomiasis is truly a "fool's dream." These "experts" believe that we are speaking as outsiders and doing things as outsiders. In their view, these people who do not understand anything dare to eliminate schistosomiasis, which is simply outrageous. They put on the faces of experts, claiming to play the role of the general staff and wanting the Party to listen to them. They say: To implement prevention first, we must focus on snail elimination, and snail elimination should be based on drugs, and drug snail elimination should be based on calcium arsenate. In terms of fecal management, they advocate building cement toilets for farmers. In terms of treatment, they only treat mild patients without symptoms and not severely ill patients who are suffering deeply, on the grounds that late-stage patients cannot be treated. For treatment, they only use antimony injections, and antimony injections only use antimony potassium and not antimony sodium. The treatment method is a twenty-day course of treatment, and the patient must rest for another twenty days after treatment. They believe that traditional Chinese medicine has no insecticidal effect, do not recognize that traditional Chinese medicine can treat schistosomiasis, and exclude and discriminate against traditional Chinese medicine. They believe that prevention and control work should rely on large hospitals and abide by a set of strict formal systems; they can only rely on full-time teams, such as specialized snail elimination teams and full-time prevention and control personnel... Let's take a look at the results achieved by following the expert line. Didn't some people advocate using calcium arsenate as the main method of snail elimination? A professor conducted a special experiment in his snail elimination experimental field. He sprinkled calcium arsenate in areas with snails. Because he did not mobilize the masses and conducted the experiment in isolation, not only were the snails not eliminated, but sixteen draught cattle were poisoned to death. They advocated using so-called scientific methods to manage feces and advocated building cement toilets, but some places built them only for sightseeing purposes; some built toilets, but the masses did not go to defecate, and instead said that it was unhygienic that no one used the toilets built for hygiene. In one area, there were 115 full-time medical personnel who treated patients in hospitals according to formal procedures. Patients were hospitalized for twenty days, costing dozens of yuan. Because it took a long time and cost a lot of money, most mild patients were unwilling to go for treatment; in the busy farming season, they were forced to go for treatment, which hindered production; and severely ill patients who had lost their ability to work were considered "out of specification" and were not given treatment. As a result, a medical worker treated an average of three patients per month. Full-time laboratory technicians worked in rural areas, only doing stool examinations. The masses said, "The schistosomiasis prevention station eats its fill and has nothing to do, specializing in playing with feces," so they did not send feces. The result of doing things according to these experts' opinions is that snails cannot be eliminated, but the draught cattle on which the masses rely for production are eliminated; severely ill patients who urgently need to relieve their pain cannot be treated, and the treatment of mild patients without symptoms hinders production. In short, their line does not truly proceed from the interests of the people. They cannot see the suffering of the broad masses of people, lack the spirit of serving the people, cannot see the power of the masses, and do not believe that schistosomiasis can be eliminated. The result must be cold and desolate, miserable and sad, slow, expensive, and wasteful. Three years of practice have proved that this path becomes narrower and narrower, and eventually leads to a dead end.

    The Decisive Factors are the Party's Leadership and the Power of the Masses
    Under the leadership of the Party, the path to eliminate schistosomiasis is completely opposite to this. Eliminating schistosomiasis is a major political issue, and the decisive factors are the Party's leadership and the power of the masses, not technical issues. Proceeding from this guiding ideology, the Party put forward the correct policy of active prevention and control, adopted comprehensive measures, launched a vigorous mass movement, and eliminated schistosomiasis in a fast, good, and economical way. The bourgeois experts also opposed this policy. They attacked our active prevention and control policy as not implementing prevention first, and only they implemented prevention first. Is this actually the case? We require disease prevention for those who have not been infected, and treatment for those who have been infected. Disease prevention does not interfere with treatment, and treatment does not interfere with disease prevention. They believe that schistosomiasis cannot be cured after infection and should not be managed. We believe that mild illnesses should be treated, and severely ill patients who are in great pain should be treated even more. Haven't some experts also admitted that eliminating a link in snail elimination, fecal management, and patient treatment can eliminate schistosomiasis? Why is it that we advocate preventing those who have not been infected from becoming infected and curing those who have been infected, both relieving the pain of patients and cutting off the link of fecal transmission, and it is not implementing prevention first? Some experts do not advocate treating severely ill patients, refusing to save them, and cannot cut off the source of infection in the feces of patients. Instead, they call it implementing prevention first. In fact, it is not surprising, because in their view, any link in snail elimination, fecal management, and patient treatment cannot be completely resolved or cut off. Their so-called "prevention first" is just a beautiful facade. They oppose comprehensive measures, believing that they do not distinguish between primary and secondary. We say that schistosomiasis uses the people's habit of using toilets, uses snails, and uses the conditions that people in the south come into contact with water everywhere to attack people, and we must eliminate it even more by using all the conditions that are unfavorable to it, finding its contradictions and weaknesses, and adopting various methods, and these methods are used differently depending on the time, place, and situation. Such comprehensive measures are a manifestation of a comprehensive viewpoint and dialectical materialism. Some bourgeois experts mechanically distinguish between primary and secondary and advocate focusing on snail elimination in isolation. This is even less intelligent than the small schistosomiasis, so how can schistosomiasis be eliminated?

    Some people oppose mobilizing the masses, saying that this is "human wave tactics" and "wasting manpower and money." If it is not malicious slander, it is extreme stupidity. In fact, mobilizing the masses is not just relying on a large number of people to work blindly, but combining mass movements with science and technology and combining large-scale mass movements with large-scale technological revolutions. This is the broad road to eliminate schistosomiasis and the source of the power to eliminate diseases. Because of relying on the masses, miracles that have never been seen before and shocked the world have been created.

    Over the past few years, the struggle between the two lines in the work of eliminating schistosomiasis has been sharp and in stark contrast. The dead end of the expert line, like a stinking ditch full of snails, has been buried by the practice of the masses, while the Party's mass line has unlimited vitality and proves even more correct and great. This is something that some bourgeois experts cannot understand and that is not recorded in any literature of world medical science.

    Mass Movements Solve Problems that Foreign Countries Cannot Solve
    Because we have implemented the Party's mass line, firmly believed in the masses, relied on the masses, and fully mobilized the masses, we have advanced triumphantly, overcome numerous difficulties, and achieved victory. When the broad masses have raised their awareness and recognized the importance of eliminating schistosomiasis, turning the work of eliminating schistosomiasis into the actions of the broad masses, countless methods have emerged and infinite power has been exerted in all aspects of snail elimination, fecal management, and patient treatment. In the practice of the masses, there have been many inventions and creations, which have enriched and improved science and technology. Some people cling to foreign literature, always believing that China's science and technology level is low. In fact, the heroic feats of the broad masses in eliminating schistosomiasis have written the world's highest-level medical and scientific literature, solving problems that foreign countries cannot solve. On the issue of eliminating schistosomiasis, it should be said that we have climbed the highest peak of world medicine. On the one hand, relying on the power of the masses, and on the other hand, overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas, breaking bourgeois medical authority, and breaking through so-called formal systems and authoritative remarks among medical and health personnel, short-course therapy, the three-way working method of doctors, nurses, and laboratory technicians, high-efficiency exercise, insecticidal Chinese medicine, fecal management and comprehensive utilization, biogasification... countless new people and new things have emerged. Chen Zhida, the founder of short-course therapy, Liu Jintao, the creator of high efficiency, and Wang Dinghuan, the inventor of compound betel nut pills... These people who were looked down upon in the past have now truly become experts in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis. In mass movements and technological revolutions, new forces are constantly emerging, and a new medical and health team that is both red and expert and eliminates harm and diseases is being formed.

    In particular, traditional Chinese medicine and folk remedies have shown their great skills. In the past, traditional Chinese medicine was not recognized at all, nor was it considered that traditional Chinese medicine could treat schistosomiasis. During the movement, it was proved that traditional Chinese medicine is the most effective in treating late-stage patients, and the theory of traditional Chinese medicine in treating schistosomiasis is to treat according to dialectics. According to extremely incomplete statistics, there are as many as seventy or eighty methods of traditional Chinese medicine for treating schistosomiasis, and many traditional Chinese medicines and folk remedies that can kill snails and schistosomiasis eggs have also been discovered. In this way, combining Chinese and Western medicine and using both native and foreign methods have eliminated the pain of millions of people and saved many critically ill lives, opening up brilliant flowers and bearing rich fruits in the medical field.

    The Victory of Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Work Points the Direction for the Entire Health Work
    The brilliant victory achieved on the schistosomiasis prevention and control front over the past few years is a victory of the Party's line and a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This victory has not only laid a solid foundation for completely eliminating schistosomiasis but also pointed out the correct direction and opened up broad avenues for eliminating other diseases that seriously endanger the people and for the entire health work. Therefore, it is of special significance to seriously summarize the experience on the schistosomiasis prevention and control front, refute bourgeois medical authority, and improve the political and ideological understanding of the broad masses of medical personnel and raise the banner of the proletariat even higher.

    With the vigorous development of the movement to eliminate schistosomiasis, the enlarged meeting of the Central Nine-Person Group held in Shanghai in October this year put forward a new battle slogan: "The whole Party mobilizes, the whole people take action, basically eliminate the five pests, eliminate the four diseases, and present a gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China." This means that within the next year, in the area of the thirteen provinces and cities in southern China, flies, mosquitoes, rats, sparrows, and snails will be basically eliminated, and schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, filariasis, and malaria will be basically eliminated. This is a glorious and great historical task. The proposal of this task has a sufficient basis and many favorable conditions: with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, there is an urgent need to eliminate pests and diseases to protect the people's labor force and physical health, especially the universal establishment of people's communes, the implementation of organizational militarization, combat operationalization, and life collectivization, the people's living habits and ideologies are also changing rapidly, and the masses have a more urgent demand for paying attention to hygiene and eliminating diseases, forming a broader mass revolutionary movement; the Party committees at all levels have further made unified plans, unified arrangements, and unified deployments for the work of eliminating pests and diseases, and strengthened leadership. Of course, it should also be recognized that this is a very arduous and complex task. But the awakened and organized Chinese people will certainly be able to accomplish this great historical task under the leadership of the Party.

    走消灭血吸虫病的路
    徐运北
    消灭血吸虫病的工作由胜利走向胜利
    “人死无人抬，家家哭声哀，屋倒田地荒，亲戚不往来”。这是上海宝山县流传的一首民谣，道出了血吸虫病流行猖獗地区的凄凉景象。血吸虫病是我国南方各省广大人民的一大祸害，流行很广，遍及江苏、浙江、湖北、湖南、安徽、江西、四川、云南、广东、广西、福建、上海等十二省市的三百五十个县（市），患病人数近一千万，受到感染威胁的人口达一亿以上。血吸虫病不仅危害人类，对牲畜也威胁很大，特别是耕牛更易感染。据不完全统计，在十二省市一百一十八个县市调查了十三万二千一百八十七头耕牛，其中最高感染率达52％以上，初步估算全国约有一百到一百五十万头耕牛感染了血吸虫病。根据调查的推算，流行区的病牛丧失劳动力达三分之一以上，对农业生产是一重大损失。
    几年来的血吸虫病防治工作，在党的领导下，充分发动群众，执行了积极防治，采取综合措施，群众运动和科学技术相结合，防治工作和生产相结合，反复到乡的正确方针，取得的成绩是巨大的。截至今年9月底止，已经治愈病人三百五十多万人，其中今年1月到6月份就治愈二百八十八万人。几年来共灭螺四十七万一千多万平方公尺，占全国有螺面积的57.3％，已进行粪便管理的乡二千七百一十个，占应管乡数的62.9％。防护工作正在变为人民的生活习惯。今年湖南、湖北、江苏、江西、安徽等省有六十多万人到疫区去打湖草，由于防护工作作得好，基本上避免了感染。经过几年来的努力，全国已出现了基本消灭血吸虫病的县市一百七十一个，乡镇二千一百八十三个，福建、江苏二省和上海市已基本上消灭了血吸虫病，更多的消灭血吸虫病的县市和省正在不断涌现出来。
    专家道路越走越窄  最后是一条死胡同
    几年来消灭血吸虫病的工作是在两条道路的斗争中发展起来的。一条是党的路线，群众路线；一条是专家路线。由于党的路线取得了胜利，消灭血吸虫病的工作才取得了胜利。
    医药卫生界有一些资产阶级的专家，他们认为血吸虫病是不能消灭的，最多只能加以控制。而控制血吸虫病是一个科学技术问题，科学技术问题只有用科学技术来解决，只有他们是“内行”，党是“外行”，群众更是无知无能，因此不要党的领导，不相信群众的力量。他们根据的是世界文献，而世界文献在他们看来是金科玉律，是不能突破的。他们说，英美等科学较发达的资本主义国家尚且不能消灭血吸虫病，如日本仅有八个县有钉螺存在，三万三千多病人，为了消灭钉螺，将稻田水渠用水泥砌成，大力防治了四十年，现在仍然未能消灭；而中国患病人数之多，钉螺散布幅员之大，传染源之广，是世界上少有的，加之科学文化落后，经济又不发达，想要消灭血吸虫病，真是“痴人说梦”。这些“专家”认为，我们是在说外行话，办外行事；在他们看来，这些这也不懂那也不懂的人，竟敢要消灭血吸虫病，真是岂有此理。他们板起专家的面孔，自命要起参谋部的作用，要党听他们的话。他们说：要贯彻预防为主就得以灭螺为主，而灭螺应以药物为主，药物灭螺又应以砒酸钙为主。在管理粪便方面，他们主张给农民修建洋灰厕所；在治疗方面，他们只治无病症的轻病人，而不治深感痛苦的重病人，理由是晚期病人无法治疗；治病也是只用锑剂注射，锑剂又只用锑钾而不用锑钠；治疗方法是二十日疗法，治疗后还要再休息二十天。他们认为，中药无杀虫疗效，不承认中医能治疗血吸虫病，排斥、歧视中医。他们认为防治工作要依靠大医院，遵守一套严格的正规制度；只能依靠专职队伍，如专门的灭螺队、专职的防治人员……。且来看看按照专家路线取得的成效吧。不是有的人主张要以砒酸钙灭螺为主吗？一位教授在他的灭螺试验田里专门进行了试验，他把砒酸钙撒在有钉螺的地区，由于没有发动群众，孤立进行，不仅钉螺没有消灭掉，反而毒死了十六头耕牛。他们主张用所谓科学的办法管理粪便，主张修洋灰厕所，但有的地方修起后只能作为参观之用；有的修了厕所，群众不去大便，反而说讲卫生修的厕所无人用实在不卫生。有一个地区，专职医务人员一百一十五人，按正规制度住院治疗，病人住院二十天，花钱几十元。由于时间长，花钱多，一般轻病人不愿去治；在农忙季节，强迫去治，妨碍了生产；而对丧失劳动能力的重病人又认为“不合规格”，不给治疗。结果一个医务人员平均每月治疗三个病人。专门的化验员在农村工作，只作粪便检查，群众说“血防站，吃饱饭没事干，专门玩大便”，因而不给送粪便。按照这些专家的意见办事的结果，是钉螺消灭不了，反而把群众赖以生产的耕牛消灭掉了；急需解除痛苦的重病人不能治疗，无病症的轻病人治疗又妨碍生产。总之他们的路线不是真正从人民的利益出发，他们看不见广大群众的疾苦，缺乏为群众服务的精神，看不见群众的力量，也根本不相信血吸虫病能够消灭，其结果必然是冷冷清清，凄凄惨惨，少慢差费。经过三年来的实践证明，这条道路越走越窄，最后是一条死胡同。
    起决定作用的是党的领导和群众的力量
    在党的领导下，消灭血吸虫病的道路则是与此完全相反的。消灭血吸虫病是一个重大的政治问题，起决定作用的是党的领导和群众的力量，而不是技术问题。从这个指导思想出发，党又提出了正确的积极防治的方针，采取综合措施，要搞轰轰烈烈的群众运动，要多快好省地来消灭血吸虫病。资产阶级专家们对这个方针也是反对的，他们攻击我们积极防治的方针不是贯彻预防为主，只有他们才是贯彻预防为主。实际上是不是这样呢？我们是对未患病的人要求防病，对已患病的人则要求治病，防病不误治病，治病不误防病。他们认为血吸虫病已经得了是没法治好的，且不要去管。我们认为轻病要治，重病人痛苦大更要治。不是有些专家也承认灭螺、管理粪便、治疗病人只要斩断一环，就可以消灭血吸虫病吗？为什么我们主张使未患病的不患病，已患病也治好，既解除病人痛苦又斩断病人粪便传染的一环，反而不是贯彻预防为主？而有些专家不主张治重病人，见死不救，又不能斩断病人粪便的传染源，反而美其名是贯彻预防为主。其实也并不奇怪，因为在他们看来，灭螺、管粪、治疗病人任何一环都是不可能彻底解决的，也是不可能斩断的。他们所谓的“预防为主”，只不过是一个漂亮的幌子罢了。他们反对综合措施，认为是不分主次。我们说血吸虫利用人民使用马桶的习惯，利用钉螺，利用南方人民到处接触水等条件，向人来进攻，而我们要消灭它，更必须利用一切不利于它的条件，寻找它的矛盾和弱点，采用各种办法，而这些办法又因时间地点情况的不同有区别地运用。这样的综合措施，正是全面观点和辩证唯物观点的体现。而有些资产阶级专家机械地分主次，孤立地主张重点灭螺，这连小小的血吸虫的智慧还不如，又怎能消灭血吸虫病。
    有些人反对发动群众，说这是“人海战术”“劳民伤财”，如果不是恶意的污蔑，也是极大的愚蠢。实际上发动群众并不是单凭人多蛮干，而是群众运动和科学技术相结合，大搞群众运动和大闹技术革命相结合。这是消灭血吸虫病的康庄大道，是消灭疾病力量的源泉。由于依靠了群众，才创造了前无古人和震撼世界的奇迹。
    几年来在消灭血吸虫病的工作中两条道路的斗争尖锐，对照鲜明，专家路线这条死胡同和生满了钉螺的臭水沟一样，已经被群众的实践埋葬，而党的群众路线却具有无限生命力，更加证明正确和伟大。这是一些资产阶级专家所不能理解和世界医学科学任何文献所没有记载的。
    群众运动解决了外国不能解决的问题
    由于我们贯彻了党的群众路线，坚决相信群众，依靠群众，充分发动群众，就势如破竹，克服重重困难，取得了胜利。当广大群众提高了觉悟，认识了消灭血吸虫病的重要性，把消灭血吸虫病的工作变成广大群众的行动，无论在灭螺、粪便管理、治疗病人等各方面，都涌现出无数办法，发挥出无穷的力量。在群众的实践中，有了很多的发明创造，丰富和提高了科学技术。有些人死抱着外国文献，总认为中国的科学技术水平低，实际上广大人民消灭血吸虫病的英雄壮举，写出了世界上水平最高的医学科学文献。解决了外国不能解决的问题。在消灭血吸虫病问题上，应该说我们已经攀上了世界医学的最高峰。一方面依靠群众的力量，一方面在医药卫生人员中，克服右倾保守思想，破资产阶级医药权威，突破所谓正规制度，权威言论，因而涌现了短程疗法，医生、护士、化验人员三结的工作方法，高工效运动中医中药杀虫，粪便的管理和综合利用，沼气化……无数新人新事。疗法创始人陈之达，高工效创造人青年医士刘锦桃，复方槟榔丸发明人王定寰……这些过去都是被人看不起的人物，现在倒真正成了防治血吸虫病的专家。在群众运动和技术革命中，新的力量不断地涌现，一支又红又专、除害灭病新的医药卫生队伍正在组成。
    尤其中医中药和土办法大显身手。过去根本不承认中医也不考虑中医能治血吸虫病，在运动中证明中医中药治疗晚期病人是最有效的，中医治疗血吸虫病的理论是辩证施治。根据极不完全的统计，中医治疗血吸虫病的方法有七、八十种之多，能灭螺和灭血吸虫卵的中药和土办法也发现了很多。这样中西结合，土洋并举，就消除了千百万人的痛苦，挽救了许多垂危的生命，在医学领域中开出灿烂之花，结出丰硕之果。
    血吸虫病防治工作的胜利为整个卫生工作指出方向
    几年来血吸虫病防治战线取得的辉煌胜利是党的路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。这个胜利，不仅为彻底消灭血吸虫病打下了巩固的基础，也为消灭其他危害人民严重的疾病和整个卫生工作指出了正确的方向，开辟了广阔的道路。因而认真总结血吸虫病防治战线上的经验，驳倒资产阶级医药权威，提高广大医务人员的政治思想认识，更高地举起无产阶级的旗帜，是有其特殊意义的。
    随着消灭血吸虫病运动的蓬勃开展，今年10月在上海召开的中央九人小组扩大会议上又提出了新的战斗口号：“全党动员，全民动手，基本上除净五害，消灭四病，向建国十周年献礼。”这就是要在今后一年的时间内，在我国南方十三个省市的区域内基本上消灭苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀和钉螺，基本上消灭血吸虫病、钩虫病、血丝虫病和疟疾，这是一个光荣伟大的历史任务。这个任务的提出有充分的根据和许多有利的条件：随着工农业生产大跃进的形势迫切的要求除害灭病，以保护人民的劳动力和身体健康，尤其普遍建立起人民公社，实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化，人民的生活习惯和意识形态也正在急剧的改变，群众对讲卫生消灭疾病有了更迫切的要求，形成更加广泛的群众性的革命运动；各级党委对除害灭病工作进一步作了统一规划、统一安排、统一部署，加强了领导。当然也应认清，这是一个非常艰巨复杂的任务。但是觉醒了的组织起来的中国人民，在党的领导下一定能完成这一伟大的历史任务。
