Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 31st: A dispatch from our correspondent: This year, the Soviet Union's steel production front is presenting a vibrant scene of vigorous development. The Soviet Union has achieved outstanding results in steel production in the first three quarters of this year: steel production has reached 40.8 million tons, an increase of 3 million tons compared with the same period last year, and pig iron production has reached 29.1 million tons, an increase of 1.6 million tons compared with the same period last year. The steel production in these three quarters is roughly equivalent to the Soviet Union's total production in 1954. It is estimated that the Soviet Union's task of producing 53.6 million tons of steel and 39.1 million tons of pig iron this year will definitely be successfully completed.

The biggest feature of Soviet steel production this year is the grand scale of construction. This year, the Soviet Union's investment in the steel industry has increased by 3.3 billion rubles compared to last year. The original first steel base in Ukraine and the second steel base in the Urals and Siberia are being expanded.

The Soviet Union is vigorously carrying out the construction of the third steel base in Kazakhstan and Siberia this year, and its annual pig iron production is expected to be 15 million to 20 million tons. The Karaganda Steel United Factory, which belongs to this base, will be fully completed in 1964, and it will produce 3 million tons of steel and 2.5 million tons of pig iron annually. This year, the construction of Soviet blast furnaces is being carried out on a scale and speed unprecedented in Soviet history. According to the plan, 14 blast furnaces will be built this year and next year, and their total production capacity will be equal to the total production capacity of all the blast furnaces built in the first two five-year plans of the Soviet Union.

The great development of steel production requires the iron ore mining industry to keep up. This year, the Soviet Union is building many large-scale iron ore mining bases in Siberia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and other places. In addition to the ore dressing combined factory in the Kustanai Oblast with an annual output of 20 million tons of iron ore, an iron mine with an annual output of 12 million tons of iron ore is being established in Krivoy Rog, and a giant open-pit iron mine has also begun construction in Siberia. It is estimated that the Soviet Union will increase its iron ore production by more than 10 million tons this year.

Another feature of Soviet steel production this year is the further improvement of technical level and labor productivity. The level of automation in Soviet ironmaking and steelmaking has surpassed all capitalist countries, including the United States, and ranks first in the world. (Attached picture)

### 苏联钢铁工业全面大跃进  建设规模空前巨大　自动化水平天下第一

    苏联钢铁工业全面大跃进
    建设规模空前巨大　自动化水平天下第一
    据新华社莫斯科31日电　本社记者报道：苏联今年在钢铁生产战线上呈现一片高歌猛进的蓬勃发展景象。苏联今年头三个季度的钢铁生产已获得出色的成绩：钢的产量已达到四千零八十万吨，比去年同期增加了三百万吨，生铁产量达到二千九百一十万吨，比去年同期增加了一百六十万吨。这三个季度的钢铁产量大约等于苏联在1954年全年的产量。据估计，苏联今年生产五千三百六十万吨钢和三千九百一十万吨生铁的任务一定能够胜利完成。
    苏联今年钢铁生产的最大特色是建设规模的宏大。今年苏联在钢铁工业方面的投资比去年增加三十三亿卢布。原有的在乌克兰的第一个钢铁基地和在乌拉尔、西伯利亚的第二个钢铁基地正在扩建。
    苏联今年在哈萨克和西伯利亚正在大力进行第三个钢铁基地的建设，它的生铁年产量预计是一千五百万到二千万吨。属于这个基地的卡拉干达钢铁联合工厂将在1964年全部建成，它每年将生产三百万吨钢和二百五十万吨生铁。今年，苏联高炉的建设是以苏联历史上未有的规模和速度来进行的，按计划，今年和明年将建成十四座高炉，它们的总生产能力将等于苏联头两个五年计划建成的全部高炉的生产能力的总和。
    钢铁生产的大发展要求铁矿开采工业紧跟上去。今年，苏联在西伯利亚、哈萨克、乌克兰等地建设许多规模巨大的铁矿开采基地。除库斯坦奈州的年产二千万吨铁矿砂的选矿联合工厂外，在克里沃罗格正在建立一个年产一千二百万吨铁矿砂的铁矿，在西伯利亚也开始建设一个巨型露天铁矿。预计，今年苏联将增产铁矿砂一千多万吨。
    苏联今年钢铁生产的另一个特色是技术水平和劳动生产率的进一步提高。苏联的炼铁和炼钢的自动化水平已经超过包括美国在内的一切资本主义国家，而居世界第一位。（附图片）
