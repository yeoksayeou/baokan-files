Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th: After striding across the iron and steel barrier, Guangdong Province already has nearly ten million laborers投入into the autumn harvest. Now, the province's 34 million mu of late rice are generally ripe, and the fields are full of golden seas. By the 7th, more than seven million mu had been harvested, and it is expected to be completed around the 20th.

Due to the exceptionally large harvest of late rice throughout the province, the amount of autumn harvest work has increased by two to three times compared with previous years. In addition, deep plowing and soil improvement, early winter planting, and steelmaking have made labor very tight. Therefore, all localities have re-adjusted their labor organizations, focusing on the autumn harvest without delaying other work, and ensuring that the exceptionally large harvest is fully secured. In terms of leadership, in addition to the first secretaries of the county Party committees in key steel producing counties grasping both autumn harvest and steel production, the first secretaries of the county Party committees in each county are using their main strength to direct the autumn harvest. When arranging labor, all localities also form specialized teams for harvesting, threshing, loading, transporting, and drying grain according to individual strengths and labor capacity, so that work is orderly and efficiency is improved. Raoping County, which was originally thought to be unable to complete the autumn harvest on time, has fixed a 100,000-strong autumn harvest army. After planning the time, it can now complete the harvest by the 16th at the latest.

In order to solve the shortage of labor and improve the efficiency of the autumn harvest, tool reforms with rapid rice harvesters as the main focus are being promoted throughout the province. Using the rice harvester, rice can be harvested while standing, which is suitable for men, women, old, and young. Both upright and lodged rice can be harvested, and it is easy to manufacture and low in cost (the cost per unit is two to three yuan). Generally, it can harvest five mu of land per day, and the efficiency is six to ten times higher than using a sickle. Dianbai and Shunde counties, after a few days of concentrated effort, realized rice harvesterization before the autumn harvest rush.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 10th: Jiangxi Province's more than 15 million mu of late rice has been completely harvested by four million agricultural army in seven days and nights of concentrated effort until the 8th. Now, all localities are conducting autumn harvest reviews to ensure that every grain returns home, and are strengthening grain storage and management.

Jiangxi has had a bumper harvest of late rice this year. At the end of October, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the people of the province to race against time and strive to complete the late rice harvest in one week. At that time, coal mining, mining, transportation, and large-scale procurement of agricultural and sideline products, centered on iron and steel, were being carried out intensively throughout the province. Thanks to the leadership of the first secretaries of Party committees at all levels, comprehensive arrangements, and mobilizing the masses to fully tap labor potential, combat organizations were established with one or several communes as units. The autumn harvest plans of each combat organization were discussed by the masses, and a responsibility system of assigning people, quantity, quality, fields, and time was implemented. In addition, meals, accommodation, meetings, selling goods, and medical care were provided in the fields. After Jiujiang Prefecture implemented this method, it completed the harvest task in three days, with an efficiency twice as high as last year. Communist coordination was also widely carried out in all localities. After completing the autumn harvest, Xingzi County transferred more than 2,000 strong laborers to support De'an County in a concentrated rush harvest. At the same time, all localities gave full play to the power of new-style agricultural tools, and Shangrao Prefecture promoted more than 12,000 rapid rice harvesters. During the rush harvest, although one-half of the labor force was drawn from the iron and steel front, the province's daily steel output remained stable at more than 3,000 tons reached during the Great Leap Forward week.

### 第一书记挂帅　组织劳动协作  广东江西劳动大军抢收晚稻

    第一书记挂帅　组织劳动协作
    广东江西劳动大军抢收晚稻
    据新华社广州9电　在大步跨过炼铁关后，广东省已有近一千万劳动大军投入秋收。现在全省三千四百多万亩晚稻普遍成熟，田野里到处是金黄色的海洋。到7日止已收割七百多万亩，预计20日左右可收完。
    由于全省晚稻特大丰收，秋收工作量比往年增大两三倍，加上深翻改土，提早冬种，炼钢炼铁，劳力十分紧张。因此，各地都重新调整劳动组织，以秋收为中心，又不耽误各项工作，一定要把特大丰收全部拿到手。在领导方面，除钢铁重点县的县委第一书记一手抓秋收，一手抓钢铁之外，各县的县委第一书记都以主要力量指挥秋收。各地在安排劳动力时还根据个人特长和劳力强弱，组成收割、脱粒、装运、晒谷等专业队，使工作有条不紊，提高效率。原来认为不能按时完成秋收的饶平县固定了十万秋收大军，规划了时间后，现在最迟在16日便可收割完毕。
    为了解决劳力不足，提高秋收效率，以快速割禾器为主的工具改革正在全省推行。使用割禾器，站立着就能割稻，男女老少都适用，直立禾和倒伏禾都可以收割；而且容易制造，成本低廉（每部成本二元至三元），每天一般能收割五亩地，效率比用镰刀提高六倍以至十倍。电白、顺德两县经过几天突击，在秋收大忙之前便实现了割禾器化。
    据新华社南昌10日电　江西省一千五百多万亩晚稻，经过四百万农业大军七昼夜突击，到8日已全部收割完。现在各地正进行秋收复查，保证做到颗粒还家，并且加强粮食储藏保管工作。
    江西今年晚稻大丰收，中共江西省委在10月底就号召全省人民与时间赛跑，争取一星期完成晚稻收割任务。当时全省以钢铁为中心的挖煤、采矿、运输以及农副产品大收大购工作正在紧张进行。由于各级党委第一书记挂帅，全面安排，发动群众充分挖掘劳动潜力，以一个或几个公社为单位建立战斗组织，个个战斗组织的秋收计划都通过群众讨论，实行定人，定量、定质、定田、定时等责任制，并且做到了吃饭、住宿、会议、卖货、医药等下田。九江专区实行这种办法后，三天就完成了收割任务，效率比去年提高一倍。各地还普遍大搞共产主义协作。星子县完成秋收后，抽调了两千多强壮劳动力去支援德安县突击抢收。同时，各地充分发挥新式农具的威力，上饶专区推广快速割禾器达一万二千多件。在突击抢收期间，虽然从钢铁战线上抽回了二分之一的劳动力，全省的钢铁日产量仍然稳定在跃进周达到的三千吨以上。（附图片）
