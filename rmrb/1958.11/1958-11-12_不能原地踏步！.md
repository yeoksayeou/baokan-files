	We Cannot Stand Still!
	Wang Wentao

	Recently, there are some people who like socialism, but when they hear about transitioning to communism, they become impatient and ask, "Is there no end to the revolution?" Especially when they see the implementation of the supply system and the reduction of their salaries, they complain, "The revolution is being directed at our own heads."
	The root cause of these people's arguments is that they are unwilling to implement communism. Communist society is a completely new society. It not only eliminates all legal systems left over from the bourgeoisie, but also eliminates the three differences: the difference between workers and peasants; the difference between urban and rural areas; and the difference between manual and mental labor. These differences still exist in socialist society. Because socialism is a society that emerges from capitalism, it inevitably carries the traces of these capitalist systems. And communism is precisely about eliminating these things.
	We often hear people say: We must consolidate socialist society. This statement is both right and wrong. It is right in relation to capitalist society: in relation to capitalist society, we must consolidate socialist society. It is wrong in relation to communist society; in relation to communist society, socialist society should not be consolidated. Those who only want to consolidate socialist society and do not want communist society will be abandoned by history if they do not change.
	There are three kinds of people in our society today. One kind of person wants neither communism nor socialism; the rightists are this kind of person. Another kind of person does not want capitalism, but wants to consolidate socialism and does not want communism. This kind of person is a status quo maintainer, a mechanist. The last kind of person wants both socialism and communism. There is no doubt that the vast majority of people in our country today are people who want both socialism and communism. Between capitalism and socialism, they have the enthusiasm for socialism. Between socialism and communism, they have the enthusiasm for communism. With these two kinds of enthusiasm, communism will be easy to achieve. Our Party supports the people's enthusiasm. Our implementation of cadres participating in labor, the establishment of people's communes, the development of rural industries, and the establishment of factories by government organizations and schools are concrete manifestations of supporting the enthusiasm of the masses.
	Frankly speaking, those who like socialism today but are not accustomed to communism may be some people with higher incomes, or perhaps a small number of our cadres, or their family members. This is because they do not understand the laws of social development. How can we reach communist society if we do not eliminate the three differences? Now you are only losing a little salary, but you are becoming a communist person. This is such a good thing, what is there to not understand!
	In fact, we communists did not have salaries in the past. In the past, we didn't have salaries, but we still completed the 25,000-li Long March, fought Japanese imperialism, and fought Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries. People don't work for salaries. If you are a communist but unwilling to implement communism, you are shooting yourself in the foot.
	It can be seen that the transition from socialism to communism is still a revolution. It cannot be a natural transition as some people say. From some facts, socialism does not necessarily lead to communism. Due to the influence of revisionism, it may also return to capitalism, such as the Tito group; due to the influence of mechanism, it may also stagnate for a long time; only under the guidance of continuous revolution can it leap and develop normally to communism. Therefore, there will inevitably be revolution and struggle during the transition to communism. However, this struggle is generally manifested as a bloodless struggle.
	Marxism-Leninism has long told us that socialist society is the lower stage of communism. After realizing this lower stage, we should actively transition to the higher stage—communism. Therefore, we cannot stop at the socialist system. We should bravely move forward and reach our ideal goal. We must shout to those who want to stand still in socialism: "Goal: Communism, Forward!"

### 不能原地踏步！

    不能原地踏步！
    王文涛
    最近，有这么一种人他们喜欢社会主义，但是一听到还要向共产主义过渡，就觉得有些不耐烦，问道：“革命就没有一个头？”特别是看到要实行供给制，降低自己的工资，更是埋怨起来：“革命革到自己头上来了。”
    这些人有这样的论调，归根结底还是不太愿意实行共产主义。共产主义社会是一个全新的社会，它不但要消灭资产阶级残余下来的一切法权制度，而且要消除三个差别，即工、农之间的差别；城、乡之间的差别；体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别。而这些在社会主义社会还是会有的。因为社会主义是从资本主义脱胎出来的一个社会，它不可避免的还要带上这些资本主义制度的痕迹。而共产主义正是要消灭这些东西。
    我们常常听到有人说：要巩固社会主义社会。这话又对又不对，说它对，是对资本主义社会说的：对资本主义社会来说，要巩固社会主义社会。说它不对，是对共产主义社会说的；对共产主义社会来说，社会主义社会是不应该巩固的。只要巩固社会主义社会，不要共产主义社会的人，倘不改变，是会被历史抛弃的。
    我们今天的社会上有三种人，一种人不但不要共产主义，也不要社会主义，右派就是这种人；一种人是不要资本主义，但要巩固社会主义，又不要共产主义，这种人是一种现状维持派，是机械论者。最后一种人是既要社会主义也要共产主义。毫无疑问，今天我国绝大多数人都是要社会主义也要共产主义的人。他们在资本主义与社会主义之间，有社会主义的积极性。在社会主义与共产主义之间有共产主义的积极性。有了这两个积极性，共产主义就好办了。我们党支持人民的这种积极性，我们实行干部参加劳动、实行人民公社、发展农村工业、机关、学校办工厂等等，就是支持人民群众这种积极性的具体表现。
    老实说，在今天喜欢社会主义而又不大习惯共产主义的，可能是一些收入较多的人吧，也可能是我们广大干部中的少数人吧，或者是他们的家属，这是他们不懂得社会发展规律，如果不消灭三个差别如何能到共产主义社会去呢？现在要你失去的只是一点工资，而要你变成一个共产主义的人，这是多么好，有什么想不通！
    其实我们共产党人过去就是没有工资的，过去没有工资，不是一样二万五千里长征，打日本帝国主义，打蒋介石反动派吗？人哪里是为了工资才做事的？如果是共产主义者而不愿意实行共产主义，那就是自己搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    可见得，从社会主义到共产主义还是要革命的，不能像有些人说的，可以自然而然的过渡。从一些事实看来，社会主义并不必然走向共产主义。由于修正主义的影响，也可能回到资本主义，例如铁托集团；由于机械论的影响，也可能长期停滞不前；只有在不断革命论的指导下，它才能飞跃的正常的发展到共产主义。因此在向共产主义过渡时，必然还会有革命，有斗争。不过这斗争一般表现为不流血的斗争罢了。
    马列主义早就告诉我们社会主义社会是共产主义的低级阶段，应该在实现了这个低级阶段以后，积极的向高级阶段——共产主义过渡，因而我们不能在社会主义制度上停止不前，应该勇往直前，一直达到我们理想的目标。我们要向想在社会主义原地踏步的人，高喊：“目标：共产主义，前进！”
