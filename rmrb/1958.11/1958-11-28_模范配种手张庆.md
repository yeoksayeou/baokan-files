    Model Breeding Technician Zhang Qing
    By our reporter Yang Shaoshan
    Daxing Village in Changtu County, Liaoning Province, is a nationally renowned model livestock village. Provincial Model Breeding Technician Zhang Qing lives there.
    In recent years, Zhang Qing has made significant contributions to the country and the people in developing livestock production, and the country and the people have given him high honors. He began learning breeding techniques in 1950, and now his breeding technique has basically reached the point of being completely accurate.
    Accumulated a Set of Experiences
    Zhang Qing has not been engaged in breeding work for a long time, but he loves this career and is good at research, so he has become an excellent breeding expert. He has accumulated a mature set of livestock breeding experience. These experiences are summarized as the "ask, test, look" combination method for judging estrus in mares. Ask, means to be familiar with the characteristics of the horse, to understand the age of the horse, whether it has foaled, the length of previous estrus periods, and so on. Test, refers to estrus testing. Look, refers to observing the estrus situation of the mare.
    When Zhang Qing started breeding, his technology and conception rate were not very high. In 1951, when he visited the Tieling Livestock Farm, he saw that the conception rate of the livestock farm reached 98%. He was very interested and asked the technical cadres in detail about the reasons. One thing he remembered particularly well was that "both the stallion and mare are your own, you can be familiar with the estrus cycle of each horse, which is conducive to timely breeding." After returning, he put a lot of effort into this, understanding and becoming familiar with the characteristics and estrus cycles of each horse. Especially after the cooperativization, he became even more active, staying with the horses all day, thinking about how to breed more and more accurately. In addition to constantly researching the use of local methods to judge estrus, he also humbly learned scientific breeding technical knowledge from local technical cadres to enrich his experience. In recent years, he has learned many advanced breeding methods such as "two-finger probing," "rectal examination," and "breeding every other day." This year, he took measures such as extracting blood from foaling mares and injecting it into non-estrus mares, and using agents to wash the uterus of mares, so that more than a dozen mares in the commune were bred successfully.
    Zhang Qing deeply realized in his work that protecting stallions to keep their sperm vigorous is another important key to improving the conception rate. Therefore, he also pays great attention to the feeding management and training of stallions. He feeds stallions in separate stalls and pays attention to pulling the horses for leisurely exercise. He once brought eggs from his home to feed the horses and collected green fodder for the horses to eat. He was afraid that the stallions would get sick, so he vacated his two houses to use as stables.
    Wish Fulfilled
    Before liberation, Zhang Qing drove carts for landlords for most of his life. He loved livestock and dreamed of raising one himself someday. However, at that time, the dream of a poor peasant was difficult to realize. After liberation, his life improved, and he raised a small colt himself. However, he saw that more farmers still had no horses to raise. In order to breed more horses, in 1950, he gladly accepted the government's offer to work as a breeding technician.
    In the past two or three years, because the horses bred by him have had high conception rates, farmers within a few dozen miles have brought their horses to him for breeding. At this time, he saw that other breeding technicians were idle, so he organized them, taught them breeding techniques, and divided them into areas to implement contracted breeding, so that they all had work to do. Zhang Qing's selfless communist spirit greatly moved the other breeding technicians, who actively participated in the breeding work, effectively promoting the development of local breeding work.
    Listening to the Party Was Not Wrong
    When Zhang Qing started pulling horses for breeding, he heard some sarcastic remarks and was once discouraged and wavered in his breeding work. After the Party organization discovered this, it pointed out the important significance of breeding work to him, which strengthened his confidence in breeding work. In 1951, he was selected as a labor model of the former Liaoxi Province because of his outstanding achievements in his work, which greatly encouraged him and made him deeply feel that listening to the Party was not wrong.
    The Party and the government also gave him many conveniences in breeding work. In 1953, his own red stallion died, and in order to help him with breeding, the government allocated him a tall "Sanhe" stallion at no cost; and repeatedly sent him to various livestock training classes to study, so that his breeding experience became more enriched and more abundant. Zhang Qing was very grateful for the care, training, and education of the Party and the government, and he told everyone that he was a Communist Party member, and if he didn't do well, he would be letting down the Party and the masses.

    模范配种手张庆
    本报记者　杨绍山
    辽宁省昌图县大兴村是全国著名的畜牧模范村，省模范配种手张庆就住在那里。
    几年来，张庆在发展畜牧业生产上，为国家和人民做出了巨大的贡献，国家和人民也给了他很高的荣誉。从1950年开始学习配种技术，到现在他的配种技术已经基本上达到了全配全准。
    积累了一套经验
    张庆从事配种工作时间不长，但是，他热爱这项事业，善于钻研，因此成为一个优秀配种专家。他积累了一套成熟的牲畜配种经验。这些经验综合起来就是“问、试、看”相结合的母马判情法。问，就是要熟悉马的特性，了解马的年龄大小，是否下过驹，以往发情期长短等等情况。试，指的试情。看，指看母马的发情情况。
    张庆开始配种的时候，技术和准驹率也不太高。1951年他在参观铁岭种畜场的时候，看到种畜场准驹率达98％，他很感兴趣，详细向技术干部询问了原因。其中有一条他记得特别牢靠，这就是“公母马都是自己的，能够熟悉每匹马的发情规律，便于做到适时配种”。回去后，他就在这方面下了很大功夫，了解和熟悉每匹马的特性和发情规律。特别是合作化以后，他更积极了，成天不离马群，琢磨怎样才能配得又多又准。他除了不断从实际中钻研用土法判情以外，还特别虚心向当地技术干部学习科学的配种技术知识，充实自己的经验。几年来，他已经学会了“二指问情”、“直肠检查”、“隔日配种”等许多先进的配种方法。今年，他采取把下驹的母马血抽出来给不发情的母马注射和用药剂洗母马子宫等办法，使社里十几匹母马都配准了驹。
    张庆在工作中深深体会到：保护种马使其精子旺盛，是提高准驹率的另一个重要关键。因此他对种马的饲养管理和调教方面也非常注意。他饲养种马都是看槽喂养，并且注意拉马逍遥运动。他曾经把自己家里的鸡蛋拿来喂马，采集青绿饲料给马吃。他怕种马受病，还把自己的两间房子腾出来做马厩。
    愿望实现了
    张庆在解放前，给地主赶了多半辈子大车，很喜爱牲口，幻想什么时候自己也能养活一头。但是，那时一个贫苦农民的愿望是难以实现的。解放以后，他的生活好起来了，自己也养活了一头小公马。但是，他看到有更多农民还没有马养。为了繁殖更多的马匹，1950年他欣然接受了政府让他做配种手的工作。
    最近两三年，由于经他手配的马，准驹率都很高，周围几十里地的农民都拉马来配种。这时，他看到别的配种手都闲起来了，便把他们组织起来，教给他们配种技术，并划分成片，实行包干配种，使他们都有了活干。张庆这种舍己为人的共产主义思想，大大感动了其他的配种手，积极参加配种工作，有力地推动了当地配种工作的开展。
    听党的话没有错
    张庆在开始拉马配种时，听到有些人讽言冷语，曾一度灰心，对配种工作发生动摇。党组织发现后，向他指出了配种工作的重要意义，使得他增强了配种工作的信心。1951年因为他工作上的出色成绩被选为原辽西省劳动模范，更使他受到了莫大的鼓舞，深深感到听党的话没有错。
    党和政府在配种工作上，也给他很多便利。1953年他自己的一匹红公马死了，政府为了帮助他配种，又无代价地拨给他一头高大的“三河”种马；并多次派他到各种畜牧训练班去学习，使他的配种经验更加充实，更加丰富了。张庆对于党和政府的关怀、培养和教育，十分感激，逢人便说，他是一个共产党员，如果干不好，真是对不起党和群众。（附图片）
