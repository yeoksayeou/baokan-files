    Struggle for Austria's Independence, Peace and Socialism
    ——Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of Austria
    By Bruno Frei, Reporter for the Austrian "Volksstimme"
    The Communist Party of Austria was born on November 3, 1918. Over the past forty years, the world has experienced two world wars, and the darkness of fascism has twice enveloped Austria. However, the vanguard of the Austrian working class, whether on the platform of legal struggle or in the harsh environment of the underground, has always held high the banner of independence. Under the guidance of the ever-victorious truth of Marxism-Leninism, the Communist Party of Austria, relying on the Austrian people, in this country with a long history and highly developed industry, has waged selfless struggles against domestic reactionary forces, against German militarism, and against U.S. imperialism. This struggle continues to this day.
    The Birth of the Party
    The Communist Party of Austria was founded at the end of the First World War, a few days before Austria declared the establishment of a republic and the multinational prison of the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated. For four centuries, the nationalities controlled by the Habsburg dynasty within this multinational monarchy became independent nations. The seven million Austrians who spoke German and lived in the Danube River Basin and the valleys of the Alps formed a new country – Austria. The revolution that completed this historical transformation was a bourgeois democratic revolution, but the October Revolution had a decisive influence on it. In January 1918, industrial workers in Vienna and Lower Austria enthusiastically responded to Lenin's "Appeal to the Toiling People of the World" and went on strike. They demanded peace and bread. Sailors in the navy combined with mass strikes of workers to launch a struggle. They also demanded the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty. A group of so-called "left-wing radicals" within the Social Democratic Party became the center of the revolutionary movement. Several leaders of this movement participated in the Zimmerwald Conference. At this conference, Lenin exposed the imperialist nature of the world war and called on revolutionary socialists to fight against the bourgeoisie of their respective countries. Due to the lack of strong revolutionary leadership, the January general strike and the naval mutiny both failed. However, after this great shock, the Austro-Hungarian Empire could only survive for a few more months. At the time of the founding of the republic, the bourgeoisie, under pressure from the masses, made huge concessions to the workers. This situation helped the Social Democratic leaders, who feared the transition from the bourgeois revolution to the proletarian revolution, to spread illusions about the bourgeois republic among the working masses. The Austrian Social Democrats' deceptive tactics were particularly clever; they disguised their opportunistic dealings with radical rhetoric. This opportunistic trick is recorded in the history of the workers' movement under the name of so-called "Austrian Marxism."
        Strengthening Influence Among the Working Masses
    The young Communist Party of Austria, from the first day of its birth, fought against "Austrian Marxism." Among the founders of the Communist Party of Austria were the leaders of the January general strike. With the establishment of the Communist Party, a turning point occurred in the history of the Austrian workers' movement; however, the Communist Party did not yet have enough strength to stand at the forefront of the working class from the very beginning and assume the responsibility of leading the working class. Although the party was weakened by sectarian struggles in the early days of the republic, it took the correct stand from the outset against the opportunistic policies of the Socialist Party members who colluded with the bourgeoisie. The Socialist Party, led by Bauer and Renner, paralyzed the workers' consciousness, telling them that only by continuously strengthening their power from one election to the next could they win a majority in Congress and thus naturally grasp state power. However, at this time, the Austrian bourgeoisie was doing its utmost to consolidate its position. On the one hand, it organized armed thugs, which later became the foundation for the emergence of Austrian fascist forces. On the other hand, it also handed over Austria's economy to foreign capitalists. The Austrian Republic was completely placed under the control of international financial capital.
    Despite the inflammatory propaganda of "Austrian Marxism," it was possible for the party to strengthen its influence among the Austrian working class due to the Socialist Party's adoption of a policy of surrender. Comrade Johann Koplenig played a leading role in transforming the Communist Party into a mass party. He was the son of a poor peasant, a worker himself, and a shoemaker by profession. At the Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Austria in 1924, he was elected as the party's General Secretary and has led the party ever since; he is now the Chairman of the Communist Party of Austria. Comrade Koplenig's main comrades-in-arms in the struggle against anti-party sectarians included Comrade Franz Honner and Fredl Fühnberg, who was then the leader of the Austrian Communist Youth League. The latter is now the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Austria. The Eighth Party Congress in 1925 finally defeated the sectarian elements and ensured the consolidation of a unified and solidified Leninist party leadership.
    The party's main task at that time was to accumulate strength to deal with the reactionary offensive. The party warned workers not to believe in the illusions about parliamentary struggle spread by the Socialist Party members. The party called for a struggle against handing over Austria's economy to international financial capital. At the party's Eighth Congress, Comrade Koplenig pointed out the danger of "German-Austrian merger" propaganda. He pointed out that the so-called argument that Austria was not viable was nothing more than an attempt to deceive the laboring masses and divert them from the struggle to defend their own interests.
          Against Fascist Dictatorship
    On July 15, 1927, the Vienna police carried out a bloody massacre. The massacre was triggered by workers holding demonstrations against the reactionary judicial authorities' acquittal of a group of fascist murderers. Hundreds of workers were sacrificed in this massacre. While the Communists demanded the dissolution of the fascist troops and the disarming of their weapons, the Socialist Party completely succumbed, thereby paving the way for the fascist thugs of the so-called "Homeland Defense Force." Encouraged by the Socialist Party's adoption of a policy of complete surrender, the reactionaries decided to crush bourgeois democracy. On May 26, 1933, the Communist Party of Austria, which led the workers in the struggle against the fascist line, was declared illegal. The party, struggling underground, called on the workers to go on the offensive and hold a general strike. On February 12, 1934, the Austrian working class launched an armed struggle against fascist thugs and the rapidly fascistizing government. However, despite the heroic resistance of the insurgents, the uprising failed. At that time, the party did not yet have enough strength to assume leadership responsibility for the February 12th uprising. However, the party's continuous struggle to establish a proletarian anti-fascist united front won the sympathy and support of the outstanding elements of the working class. In the flames of street fighting, in prisons and concentration camps, the Communist Party of Austria became a mass party, becoming the leading force of the Austrian working class in the struggle against fascist dictatorship.
    At the same time, even as Austria's fascist scum were desperately trying to lean on Mussolini's Italy, Hitler, who came to power in 1933, never relaxed his preparations to attack Austria. Comrade Koplenig said at the underground party conference in August 1934: "Since Hitler came to power, the main political issue in Austria has been the independence of the country and resistance to Hitler fascism." After Hitler came to power, the struggle for national independence throughout Europe intensified. Hitler's rise to power in Austria promoted the strengthening of the Austrian people's national consciousness and strengthened their will to fight to defend the independence of their motherland. Relying on the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, the Communists developed the principle of Austria's national independence and autonomy.
    After Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, Austrian Communists called on the people to oppose the alien rule of the Germans. When the German army entered Austria, the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party appealed in a proclamation to the people: "Unite to form a common front for all of Austria!"
    In July 1938, in a declaration to all the Austrian people, the Communist Party put forward a program for the possibility of escaping the shackles of the enslavers in the form of a national liberation movement. The declaration stated: "German fascists who enslave Austria are a brutal but short-lived force. No matter how cruel their oppression, alien rule can only be an interlude in history. In the end, the power of the people will prevail over the power of the oppressors." The party put forward the establishment of a free, independent, and democratic Austria as the goal of the struggle. At the Thirteenth Party Congress held in 1946, immediately following the Soviet army's liberation of Austria, Comrade Fredl Fühnberg explained the party's political program in the underground struggle against German alien rule with the following passage. He said: "Only by combining the people's liberation struggle for democracy and against fascist dictatorship with the national liberation struggle for Austrian independence can we arouse the forces among the masses of people that can successfully resist German fascism. The working class should play a leading role in this struggle for national and political liberation. Only by taking this path can we achieve the unity of the Austrian people in the anti-fascist struggle."
        Striving for National Rejuvenation
    In the struggle for Austria's national rejuvenation, the Communists displayed themselves as outstanding Austrian patriots. Our party's ranks have paid a huge price. Thousands of Communists were sentenced to death, and tens of thousands of Communists were thrown into prisons and concentration camps. German fascists devastated a large number of underground party cadres. These party cadres had been devoted to organizing armed forces and guerrilla activities. Many people died in guerrilla warfare. However, despite the bloodshed and sacrifice, the Communists still failed to attract the broad masses of people to participate in the struggle against alien rule. Because most of the leaders of other political parties were unwilling to participate in this struggle. The leaders of the Socialist Party did not recognize the anti-Hitler struggle as having a national character. They even saw the "German-Austrian merger" as a historical process. Due to the weakness of the anti-fascist national movement, the burden of liberating Austria fell primarily on the shoulders of the Soviet army. Regardless of all the conspiracies of the Western powers, the Soviet Union advocated the establishment of an independent Austrian state at the Yalta and Tehran conferences. Under the conditions of the four-power occupation, the Second Austrian Republic became a stage for U.S. imperialism to conduct a cold war against socialist bloc countries. Instead of promoting the unity of the working class, the Socialist Party concluded a coalition pact with the bourgeois parties (the Catholic Party named "People's Party"). The leaders of the right-wing Socialist Party replaced the struggle against capitalism with the struggle against communism.
        Maintaining National Independence and Neutrality
    They joined hands with the parties of big capitalists and opened the door to the U.S. Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan contained an obvious threat to turn Austria into a U.S. colony and strike at Austrian independence again. The plan of U.S. imperialism was to drag Austria, in whole or in part, into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and turn it into a military bridgehead against the Soviet Union. Under extremely difficult circumstances, the Communist Party of Austria fought against all these war preparations. The Communists were advanced fighters in the struggle to conclude an Austrian State Treaty ensuring Austria's independence and neutrality. Austrian Communist parliamentarian Ernst Fischer, speaking in Congress against the U.S. plan to split Austria, cried out: "Austria should not become the Korea of Europe!" As early as 1952, the slogan "Fight for an Independent and Neutral Austria!" became the election slogan of the Communists and the opposition forces that supported the Communists. It became increasingly clear that German militarism, nurtured by the Americans, was once again threatening Austria. In the military plans of U.S. strategists, Austria, the "fortress of the Alps," was an important link in the chain of anti-Soviet military positions that stretched across Europe. The Austrian State Treaty signed in May 1955 was an achievement of the Soviet diplomatic front, which dealt a severe blow to the aggressive plans of the U.S. warmongers. Austria was removed from the scope of the combined military operations of the NATO generals. Austria became a neutral country. Once again, it was the Soviet Union, and not others, that safeguarded Austria's independence from the dangerous aggressive conspiracies of imperialism. With the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, a new historical stage began to emerge. The resolution of the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party on May 20, 1955, put forward the primary task for the future: "Ensuring and consolidating Austria's neutrality and independence." At the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee in November 1955, the party leadership once again emphasized that the threat of imperialists plotting new conspiracies to undermine Austrian neutrality, relying primarily on their agents in West Germany, was inevitable. Faced with the increasingly acute class struggle, the united front proposed by the working class is more necessary than ever. Due to the consistent struggle of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, the reactionaries suffered two defeats in the Republic's congressional elections. The Communists believe that in the daily practice of class struggle, Socialist Party workers deeply understand that the anti-communism of the right-wing Socialist Party leaders will not only separate them from the struggle to improve economic conditions, but also from the struggle for national independence. The Communists are fighting against the intensification of exploitation and for the improvement of living conditions and working conditions. They tell the workers that concerted action is a prerequisite for overcoming poverty and capitalist crises and embarking on the road to socialist victory.
    Ensuring national neutrality in the interests of peace remains the most important combat task of the Austrian Communists to this day. The vast majority of the people support neutrality, but a small number of powerful groups are trying to drag Austria into the U.S. imperialist camp. True neutrality requires stopping malicious propaganda against socialist countries, restoring normal relations with the German Democratic Republic (just as relations have been established with West Germany), and, above all, establishing normal relations with the People's Republic of China. A few days ago, Comrade Koplenig said as a member of Congress that if Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark, which are members of NATO, have established diplomatic relations with China, then neutral Austria must also establish normal diplomatic relations with China. Faced with the already mature crisis of the world capitalist market, expanding trade relations with socialist countries is absolutely necessary for Austria. The same view was expressed at the Seventeenth Party Congress in 1957. This Congress dealt a powerful blow to all attempts to peddle revisionist contraband within the Communist Party. Following the Seventeenth Party Congress, an extraordinary emergency party conference was held in February of this year. This conference put forward the programmatic outline of "Austria's Road to Socialism." This document stated: "The October Socialist Revolution fundamentally shook the imperialist colonial system. The victory of the Chinese people marked the beginning of the inevitable collapse of the imperialist colonial system." This programmatic outline pointed out that the anti-imperialist liberation struggles of the people of colonial countries are of extreme importance for the victory of socialism. The outline stated: "The international working class supports the national liberation struggles of the people of colonial countries, which weaken the forces of imperialism."
    The Austrian Communists, as well as all progressive strata of the Austrian people, express ardent concern for the Chinese people's just struggle against the U.S. imperialism's occupation of Chinese territory by force. The activists of our party are doing everything they can to promote the slogan "Americans get out of Taiwan!" They know that supporting the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. aggressors is also striking at the main enemy of their own country's independence. Not long ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Ending the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly U.S. imperialism, is the task of the people of the world." Today, as Austrian Communists look back on the forty years of struggle for independence, peace, and socialism, they can say without hesitation that they understand this task very clearly. Because they are fighting to ensure Austria's independence and neutrality, opposing the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, exposing anti-communist lies, and strengthening the unity of the working class, they are also defending peace in the heart of Europe.

    为争取奥地利的独立、和平和社会主义而斗争
    ——纪念奥地利共产党成立四十周年
    奥地利“人民之声报”记者　布鲁诺·弗莱
    奥地利共产党诞生于1918年11月3日。四十年来，世界上曾经爆发过两次大战，法西斯的黑夜也曾两度笼罩过奥地利。但是，奥地利工人阶级的先锋队，无论在合法斗争的讲坛上或是在地下的艰苦环境中，都一直高举着独立的旗帜。在百战百胜的马克思列宁主义真理的指引下，奥地利共产党依靠着奥地利人民，在这个有着悠久的文化和工业高度发达的国家里，为反对国内反动势力、为反对德国军国主义和美帝国主义而进行了忘我的斗争。这一斗争一直继续到今天。
    党的诞生
    奥地利共产党是在第一次世界大战末期，在奥地利宣布成立共和国、各族人民的大监牢奥匈帝国瓦解的几天以前成立的。四百年来，被哈布斯堡王朝控制在这个多民族的君主国内的各民族，变成了独立的民族。居住在多瑙河流域和阿尔卑斯山河谷一带操德语的七百万奥地利人，组成了一个新的国家——奥地利。完成这一历史变革的革命，是一个资产阶级民主革命，但是十月革命对它起了决定性的影响。1918年1月，维也纳和下奥地利的产业工人，热烈响应列宁“告世界劳动人民书”的号召，举行了罢工。他们要求和平与面包。海军的水兵们同工人的群众性罢工结合起来，掀起了斗争。他们还要求立即缔结和约。社会民主党内部的一批所谓“左翼激进分子”，成了革命运动的中心。这一运动的几个领导人，参加了齐美尔瓦尔得代表会议。列宁在这个会议上，揭穿了世界大战的帝国主义性质，并且号召革命的社会主义者为反对各自国家的资产阶级而斗争。由于缺乏强有力的革命领导，一月大罢工和舰队水兵起义，都遭到了失败。但是，经过这次的大震动以后，奥匈帝国只能维持几个月的寿命了。在成立共和国时，资产阶级在群众的压力下对工人作了巨大的让步。这种情况有助于那些害怕从资产阶级革命向无产阶级革命过渡的社会民主党领袖们，在工人群众中散布对资产阶级共和国的幻想。奥地利社会民主派的蛊惑人心的手法特别巧妙，他们以过激的言论掩饰了机会主义的勾当。这种机会主义的把戏，是以所谓“奥地利马克思主义”的名称载入工人运动的史册的。
        加强在工人群众中的影响
    年青的奥地利共产党，从它诞生的第一天起，就进行了反对“奥地利马克思主义”的斗争。在奥地利共产党的创始人当中有一月大罢工的领导者。随着共产党的建立，奥地利工人运动史出现了一个转折点；但是共产党还没有足够的力量，以便从建党伊始就站在工人阶级的最前列来担负起领导工人阶级的责任。尽管在共和国成立的初期，党因宗派斗争而变得软弱无力，但是党一开始就对那些同资产阶级勾搭在一起的社会党人的机会主义政策采取了正确的立场。由鲍威尔和伦纳领导的社会党，麻痹工人的意识，告诉他们只有等到从一次大选到一次大选他们的力量不断强大起来时，结局在国会就赢得多数，从而自然地就掌握了国家政权。可是，就在这个时候，奥地利资产阶级极力巩固自己的地位。一方面它组织了武装匪徒，这在后来成了奥地利法西斯势力赖以产生的基础。另一方面，它还把奥地利的经济交给外国资本家掌握。奥地利共和国完全被置于国际金融资本的控制之下。
    尽管有“奥地利马克思主义”的煽动性宣传，由于社会党采取了投降主义的政策，党便有可能加强在奥地利工人阶级中的影响。约翰·柯普勒尼希同志在把共产党变为群众性的政党中起了领导的作用。他是贫农的儿子，他本人是工人，职业是皮鞋匠。在1924年奥地利共产党第六次代表大会上，他当选为党的总书记，从那以后一直领导着党，现在是奥地利共产党主席。柯普勒尼希在同反党的宗派分子进行斗争时的主要战友，有弗朗茨·杭纳尔同志和当时领导奥地利共产主义青年团的弗雷德尔·费恩伯同志。现在，后者是奥地利共产党的总书记。1925年的第八次党代表大会最后战胜了宗派主义分子，确保了统一的巩固的列宁式的党的领导。
    当时党的主要任务是要积蓄力量以对付反动派的进攻。党警告工人不要相信社会党人散布的对议会斗争的幻想。党号召为反对把奥地利的经济交给国际金融资本而进行斗争。在党的第八次代表大会上，柯普勒尼希同志就指出了“德奥合并”宣传的危险。他指出所谓奥地利没有生存能力的说法，无非是要欺骗劳动群众，使他们脱离保卫自身利益的斗争。
          反对法西斯专政
    1927年7月15日，维也纳的警察进行了一次血腥的大屠杀。这次屠杀的起因是工人们举行示威游行，反对反动的司法当局对一批法西斯凶手所作的无罪判决。在这次屠杀中牺牲了上百的工人。正当共产党人要求解散法西斯部队和解除他们的武器时，社会党却完全屈膝投降，从而为所谓“祖国保卫团”的法西斯匪徒开道。在社会党采取彻底投降的政策鼓舞下，反动派决定粉碎资产阶级式的民主。1933年5月26日，领导工人为反对法西斯路线而斗争的奥地利共产党，被宣布为非法。处在地下斗争的党，号召工人们转入反攻，举行总罢工。1934年2月12日，奥地利工人阶级掀起武装斗争来反对法西斯匪徒和迅速法西斯化的政府。但是，尽管起义者的英勇抵抗，起义还是失败了。当时党还没有足够的力量担负2月12日起义战斗的领导责任。然而，党为建立无产阶级反法西斯统一战线而不断进行的斗争，博得了工人阶级优秀分子的同情和支持。在巷战的烈火中，在监狱和集中营里，奥地利共产党变成了一个群众性的政党，变成了奥地利工人阶级在反对法西斯专政斗争中的领导力量。
    同时，就在奥地利的法西斯败类极力想投靠墨索里尼的意大利时，1933年上台的希特勒一刻也不放松地准备进攻奥地利。柯普勒尼希同志在1934年8月地下党代表会议上说：“自从希特勒上台以来，奥地利的主要政治问题，就是国家独立和反抗希特勒法西斯主义的问题。”希特勒上台后，整个欧洲争取民族独立的斗争尖锐化了。希特勒的上台，在奥地利促进了奥地利人民的民族自觉的加强，并坚定了他们为维护祖国独立而斗争的意志。共产党人依靠马克思列宁主义的学说，发展了关于奥地利民族独立自主的原理。
    在1938年希特勒吞并了奥地利以后，奥地利共产党人号召人民反对德国人的异族统治。当德国军队开进奥地利的时候，奥共中央委员会在告人民书中呼吁：“联合起来组成全奥地利的共同战线！”
    1938年7月，共产党在向全体奥地利人民发表的一项宣言中，提出了用民族解放运动方式有可能摆脱奴役者桎梏的纲领。宣言中说：“奴役奥地利的德国法西斯，是一个残暴然而短命的势力。不论它的压迫如何残酷，异族统治毕竟只能是历史上的一段插曲而已。到头来，人民的力量会胜过压迫者的力量。”党提出建立一个自由、独立和民主的奥地利作为斗争的目标。在1946年紧跟着苏军解放奥地利以后举行的第十三次党代表大会上，弗雷德尔·费恩伯同志用下面一段话说明了党在反对德国人异族统治的地下斗争的政治纲领。他说：“只有把争取民主和反对法西斯专政的人民解放斗争同争取奥地利独立的民族解放斗争结合起来，才能够唤起人民群众中那些成功地反抗德国法西斯的力量。工人阶级应当在这一争取民族解放和政治解放的斗争中起领导作用。只有走这条道路才能实现奥地利人民在反法西斯斗争中的团结。”
        争取民族复兴
    在争取奥地利的民族复兴的斗争中，共产党人显示为优秀的奥地利爱国者。我们党的队伍曾经付出了巨大的牺牲。成千的共产党人被判处死刑，上万的共产党人被投入监狱和集中营。德国法西斯摧残了大批的地下党的干部。这些党的干部曾经致力于组织武装部队和游击队的活动。许多人在游击战争中牺牲了。但是，尽管流血牺牲，共产党人仍未能吸引广大的人民群众参加反对异族统治的斗争。因为其它政党的大多数领导人，不愿意参加这个斗争。社会党的领导人不承认反希特勒的斗争具有民族的性质。他们甚至把“奥德合并”看作是一个历史过程。由于反法西斯民族运动的软弱无力，解放奥地利的担子首先落在苏军的肩上。苏联不顾西方列强的一切阴谋诡计，在雅尔塔会议和德黑兰会议上，主张建立一个独立的奥地利国家。在四国占领的条件下，第二个奥地利共和国变成了美帝国主义对社会主义阵营国家进行冷战的舞台。社会党不去促进工人阶级的团结，反而同资产阶级政党（以“人民党”命名的天主教党）缔结了联合公约。右翼社会党的领袖们，用反对共产主义的斗争来代替反对资本主义的斗争。
        维护国家的独立和中立
    他们同大资本家的政党携起手来，向美国的马歇尔计划洞开国门。在马歇尔计划中包藏着有把奥地利变成美国殖民地，重新打击奥地利独立的明显的威胁。美帝国主义的计划，是要把奥地利全部或局部地拖进北大西洋公约组织，把它变成反苏的军事桥头堡。奥地利共产党在极端艰巨的情况下，为反对所有这些备战的计划而进行了斗争。共产党人是争取缔结确保奥地利独立与中立的奥地利国家条约而斗争的先进战士。奥共国会议员艾伦斯特·费舍尔，在国会发言反对美国分裂奥地利的计划时，大声疾呼地说：“奥地利不应该成为欧洲的朝鲜！”早在1952年，“为独立的和中立的奥地利而斗争！”的口号，就成了共产党人和支持共产党的在野力量的竞选口号。事情越来越明显，由美国人豢养的德国军国主义，又在威胁奥地利了。在美国战略家的军事计划中，奥地利这个“阿尔卑斯山的要塞”，是布满整个欧洲的反苏军事阵地链条中的一个重要环节。1955年5月签订的奥地利国家条约，是苏联外交战线的一个成果，它使美国战争贩子的侵略计划遭到了惨重的失败。奥地利脱离了北大西洋公约组织将军们的联合军事行动的范围。奥地利成了中立国家。这次又是苏联从帝国主义的危险的侵略阴谋中维护了奥地利的独立，而不是别人。随着奥地利国家条约的签订，开始出现一个新的历史阶段。1955年5月20日奥共中央的决议提出了今后的首要任务是：“确保和巩固奥地利的中立和独立。”在1955年11月的第八次中央全体会议上，党的领导再一次强调帝国主义者首先依靠他们在西德的代理人来策划破坏奥地利中立的新阴谋的威胁是不可避免的。面对着日益尖锐化的阶级斗争，工人阶级提出的统一战线比任何时候都更加需要。由于社会党和共产党的一致斗争，在共和国国会选举中，反动派遭到了两度的失败。共产党人认为，在阶级斗争的日常实践中，社会党工人深切体会到，右翼社会党领袖们的反共，不仅会使他们脱离改善经济条件的斗争，而且脱离争取国家独立的斗争。共产党人为反对加强剥削、为争取改善生活状况和工作条件而进行斗争。他们告诉工人们说，一致行动是战胜贫困和资本主义危机以及走上社会主义胜利道路的必要条件。
    为和平的利益而确保国家中立，直到今天仍是奥地利共产党人的最主要的战斗任务。绝大多数的人民拥护中立，但是少数的有势力的集团，力图把奥地利拖进美帝国主义的阵营。名副其实的中立要求是：制止反社会主义国家的恶毒宣传，同德意志民主共和国恢复正常关系（就如同跟西德建立的关系一样），而首先是同中华人民共和国建立正常的关系。几天以前，柯普勒尼希同志作为国会议员发言时说，如果说北大西洋公约组织的成员国英国、荷兰和丹麦都同中国建立了外交关系，那末中立的奥地利也必须同中国建立正常的外交关系。面对着世界资本主义市场的已经成熟的危机，扩大同社会主义国家的贸易关系，对于奥地利说来是绝对需要的。在1957年的第十七次党代表大会上，也提出了同样的意见。这次代表大会对于在共产党内贩卖修正主义黑货的一切企图给予了强有力的打击。在第十七次党代表大会以后，今年2月又召开了党的特别紧急代表会议。这次会议提出了“奥地利走向社会主义道路”的纲领性提纲。这个文件中说：“十月社会主义革命从根底上动摇了帝国主义殖民体系。中国人民的胜利，标志着不可阻挡的帝国主义殖民体系崩溃的开始。”这个纲领性的提纲指出，殖民地各国人民的反帝解放斗争，对于社会主义的胜利具有极其重大的意义。提纲中说：“国际工人阶级在支援削弱帝国主义力量的殖民地各国人民的民族解放斗争。”
    奥地利共产党人以及奥地利人民的一切进步阶层，对于中国人民为反对以武力霸占中国领土的美帝国主义而进行的正义斗争，表示热切的关怀。我党的积极分子尽一切力量来推广“美国人滚出台湾去！”这个口号。他们知道，支持中国人民反对美国侵略者的斗争，同时也就是打击自己祖国独立的主要敌人。不久以前，毛泽东同志说：“结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的任务。”今天当奥地利共产党人回顾四十年来所走过的争取独立、和平和社会主义斗争的道路时，他们可以毫不犹豫地说，他们对于这个任务体会得十分清楚。由于他们为确保奥地利的独立和中立而斗争，反对美帝国主义的阴谋诡计，揭露反共的谎言，并且加强工人阶级的团结，他们也就是保卫了欧洲心脏地带的和平。
