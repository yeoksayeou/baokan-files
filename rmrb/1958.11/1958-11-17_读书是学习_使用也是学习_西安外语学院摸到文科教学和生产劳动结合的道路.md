Reading is Learning, Using is Also Learning
Xi'an Foreign Languages Institute Finds a Way to Combine Liberal Arts Teaching with Productive Labor

(Our newspaper, Xi’an, 16th) Xi’an Foreign Languages Institute is implementing a work-study program and has initially explored how liberal arts students can combine education with productive labor.

In March of this year, the school established a work-study program group and a labor production brigade, designating nearby Jiang Village as a fixed labor classroom for teachers and students. Labor became a required course. However, they had not yet found a feasible way to conduct teaching during labor. After several months of practice and exploration, they created teaching methods such as unit-based instruction, practical application, movement-based learning, and coordinated collaboration, enabling various types of productive labor to be closely integrated with foreign language teaching.

Currently, the school has established seventeen factories and farms and has established a translation and teaching research office. In addition to working in factories and farms, teachers and students have also undertaken translation tasks for twenty-one industrial and mining enterprises and teach courses at the school's affiliated middle school, agricultural vocational school, and spare-time foreign language night school. These places are used as fixed locations for foreign language teaching that combines productive labor and connects with reality.

Students attend classes in the morning and take their tools to factories and farms to work in the afternoon. Teachers and students working in the printing factory learn new characters and sentence structures from the work-study manuals while typesetting, printing, and proofreading them. Once the work-study manuals were printed, they had also learned the Russian vocabulary related to the school running factories and farms on a large scale, teachers and students going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, etc. Recently, in conjunction with the anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution, the school launched a unit-based teaching method. All students wrote letters in Russian to Soviet friends and university Communist Youth League organizations to congratulate them, and they informed their Soviet friends about the school's implementation of the work-study program and the participation of teachers and students in the autumn harvest and autumn planting and steelmaking. During the writing process, teachers promptly pointed out the errors and problems they found, and students reported that they had gained a great deal. Students working in Jiang Village also learned to converse in Russian or English, engaging in question-and-answer exchanges about raising pigs, accumulating fertilizer, and harvesting crops, as well as collecting the vocabulary, folk songs, and proverbs of the working people. Teachers helped correct pronunciation and resolve difficult problems. After returning to school, they compiled textbooks such as pig-raising conversation manuals and terms for industrial and agricultural labor. In the process of translating industrial materials, they learned about the current situation and requirements of industrial construction, extracting typical examples and new vocabulary to compile into books as teaching materials or supplementary materials. Now, students have begun to translate the high-yield satellites on the national agricultural front into Russian as teaching materials for agricultural vocational schools. Third- and fourth-year students also go to spare-time foreign language night schools and other places to teach courses, strengthening their professional practice.

This method of "doing something, learning something, learning while doing" has been very effective. More than 95% of fourth-year students can speak Russian in daily conversations, and second- and third-year students can generally conduct classroom discussions and write learning reflections in Russian. The vocabulary learned in labor practice is rich and colorful and easy to remember. It used to be difficult to learn six to seven thousand words in three years, but now they have broken through ten thousand words. The phenomenon of only being able to fluently recite Pushkin's poems and Gogol's novels and other Russian classical literature, but not being able to say modern terms such as "socialism," "both red and expert," and "Great Leap Forward" is gone forever. Students happily said: "We have changed from learning 'dead Russian' to learning 'living Russian'." Now, the whole school truly has exhibitions in every class and creations by everyone. In one semester, the novels and plays translated by students, the scientific research papers written, etc., have increased tenfold compared to the sum of the past three years. It has also completely changed the past phenomenon of "what is learned cannot be used, and what is used cannot be learned."

Xi'an Foreign Languages Institute has officially implemented a work-study program. Students work half a day and study half a day. During busy farming seasons and autumn harvests, they concentrate on learning and concentrated labor. This semester, the school's work-study affiliated middle school has established a kindergarten, and the school's farm has established an agricultural vocational school, forming a chain-like work-study education system. University students teach in middle schools, and middle school students work as teachers in kindergartens, cultivating all-rounders who are both university students, workers, farmers, and teachers.

    读书是学习　使用也是学习
    西安外语学院摸到文科教学和生产劳动结合的道路
    本报西安16日电　西安外语学院实行半工半读，初步摸索到文科学生如何使教育与生产劳动相结合的道路。
    今年3月，学校成立了勤工俭学小组和劳动生产大队，把附近的姜村作为师生固定的劳动课堂，劳动成了必修课程。但是，对在劳动中如何进行教学，还没有寻找出可行的门路。经过几个月实践和摸索后，创造出单元、实践、运动、联系协作等教学法，使各种生产劳动都能与外语教学紧密地结合起来。
    现在，学校已经办了十七个工厂和农场，成立了编译教学研究室。师生们除在工厂、农场劳动外，还承受了二十一个工矿企业的翻译任务，并且在学校办的附属中学、农业专科学校和业余外语夜校教课。把这些地方作为外语教学结合生产劳动、联系实际的固定场所。
    学生们上午上课，下午带着工具到工厂、农场中劳动。在印刷厂劳动的师生们，一边排、印、校对勤工俭学手册，一边学习手册中的生字和句子构造等，勤工俭学手册印完了，这本小册子中有关学校大办工厂、农场、师生上山下乡等方面的俄文生字生词和语汇也学会了。最近，学校结合苏联十月社会主义革命节，又开展了单元教学法，全校学生用俄文向苏联朋友、大学的共青团组织写信祝贺，并且把学校实行半工半读、师生参加秋收秋播、炼钢的情况告诉苏联友人。在写作中，教师及时指出发现的错误和问题，学生反映收获很大。在姜村劳动的学生们也学着用俄语或英语会话，双方一问一答地交谈着养猪、积肥、收割庄稼的情况和操作方法，搜集劳动人民的语汇、民歌和谚语，教师们帮助校正发音，解决疑难问题。回校后，又编成养猪会话手册、工农业劳动用语等教材。在翻译工业资料的过程中，了解当前工业建设的情况和要求，把其中的典型例句、新的语汇摘录汇集成册，作为教材或补充资料。现在，学生们又开始把全国农业战线上的高产卫星翻译成俄文，作为农业专科学校的教材；三、四年级学生还到业余外语夜校等地去教课，加强业务实践。
    这种做什么，学什么，边做边学的方法，收效很好。四年级学生95％以上在日常交谈中都能用俄语讲话了，二、三年级学生也普遍能用俄语进行课堂讨论、写学习心得。在劳动实践中学习的语汇丰富多彩，也容易记忆。原来三年学六千到七千单字还很困难，现在已经突破一万字了。过去那种只能流利地背诵普希金的诗篇、果戈理的小说等俄罗斯古典文学，而不会说“社会主义”“又红又专”“大跃进”等现代用语的现象一去不复返了。学生们高兴地说：“我们由学‘死俄语’变成学‘活俄语’了。”现在，全校真是班班有展览，人人有创作。一学期中，学生们翻译的小说、剧本，写的科学研究论文等，比过去三年的总和增加了十倍。并彻底改变了过去那种“学的用不上，用的学不来”的现象。
    西安外语学院已经正式实行半工半读，学生们半天劳动，半天学习，农忙、秋收等季节便集中学习，集中劳动。这学期，学院办的半工半读附属中学，又办了幼儿园，学院的农场设立一个农业专科学校，形成了连环套式的半工半读教育体系，大学生到中学教课，中学生到幼儿园当教师，培养出又是大学生，又是工人、农民和教师的多面手。
