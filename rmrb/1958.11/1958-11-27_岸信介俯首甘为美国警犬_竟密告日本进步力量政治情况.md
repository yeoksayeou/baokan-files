Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 26th: According to a revelation by "Akahata" today, the Nobusuke Kishi government, which willingly betrays the interests of the Japanese nation, once ordered the Procurement Agency to investigate and produce a secret report entitled "The Relationship Between the House of Representatives Electoral Districts and the Various Facilities Areas Provided by Japan to the United States," reporting to the U.S. government and U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan on the political situation of Japanese progressive forces in areas adjacent to U.S. military bases.

The Nobusuke Kishi government, under the pretext that it was "necessary to defend U.S. military bases," ordered the production of this secret report, which was handed over to the U.S. government and U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan on September 1st. The main content of the report is about the situation of the Communist Party, Socialist Party, trade unions, and democratic organizations in the vicinity of U.S. military bases in Japan, as well as an analysis of the votes obtained by candidates of various parties who participated in the general election held in May this year.

According to the newspaper, in July this year, members of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" conducted identity investigations on members of the Communist Party, Socialist Party, trade unions, and democratic organizations near the U.S. military base in Niigata Prefecture. This investigation was protested by democratic organizations, and the "Self-Defense Forces" authorities explained at the time that their superiors had ordered them to investigate and produce a "political map" of the area around the base. The newspaper pointed out that the Procurement Agency's report was based on these investigations and constituted a "left-wing political map" covering the entire country of Japan.

"Akahata" pointed out that this report is closely related to the various policies being pursued by the Nobusuke Kishi government to establish a military police state and will become basic data for intensifying the suppression of the Japanese people within the new U.S.-Japan military system it is attempting to build, centered on the "U.S.-Japan Mutual Security Treaty."

The newspaper pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government, under the pretext of dealing with "indirect aggression," is preparing to submit the "Anti-Democratic Subversive Activities Prevention Bill" and the "Anti-Espionage Law" to the next ordinary session of the Diet, in order to further suppress the Japanese people. "Akahata" pointed out that this report is related to these reactionary bills. The Nobusuke Kishi government, regardless of the opposition of the Japanese people, secretly handed over such a report to the U.S. military, which thoroughly exposed its anti-national militarist nature.

    岸信介俯首甘为美国警犬
    竟密告日本进步力量政治情况
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天揭露，甘心出卖日本民族利益的岸信介政府曾经命令调达厅调查和制作一份题为“众议院选举区同日本向美国提供的各种设施区域的关系”的秘密报告书，向美国政府和驻日美军当局报告美军基地邻近地区的日本进步力量的政治情况。
    岸信介政府以对“防卫美军基地是必要的”为口实而下令制作的这份秘密报告书已经在9月1日交给了美国政府和驻日美军当局。报告书的主要内容是关于在日本的美军基地邻近地区的共产党、社会党、工会和民主团体的情况以及对参加今年5月间举行的大选的各党候选人所得票数的分析。
    据报纸报道，今年7月间，日本“自卫队”队员对在新澙县的美军基地附近的共产党员、社会党员和工会、民主团体的会员进行了身份调查，这次调查曾经遭到民主团体的抗议，“自卫队”当局当时解释说，上司命令他们调查和制作基地周围的“政治地图”。报纸指出，调达厅的报告书就是根据这些调查作成的涉及日本全国范围的“左翼政治地图”。
    “赤旗报”指出，这份报告书同岸信介政府正在推行的为建立军事警察国家的各种政策有密切关系，并且将在它企图建立的以“日美共同防御条约”为中心的新的日美军事体系中，成为加紧镇压日本人民的基本资料。
    报纸指出，岸信介政府以对付“间接侵略”为口实，正在准备向下届国会平时会议提出“防止反民主破坏活动法案”和“防谍法”，借以进一步镇压日本人民。“赤旗报”指出，这份报告书同这些反动法案是有关连的，岸信介政府不顾日本人民的反对，偷偷地把这样的报告书交给美军，这就彻底暴露了它的反民族的军国主义的本质。
