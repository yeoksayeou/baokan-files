    In the Glow of October
    —On the Soviet Film "The Communist"
    Yimo
    From the very first day of its birth, the Soviet Republic began a desperate fight against all domestic and foreign reactionary forces. The enemy not only carried out a brutal military encirclement against it but also exhausted all available means – destroying transportation lines, cutting off fuel supplies, hoarding and monopolizing grain to create famine, forcing factories to shut down, and causing unemployment, to strangle the young Soviet state. However, the Russian proletariat, full of confidence, under the leadership of the great Lenin and the Bolshevik Party, began to build a socialist motherland in those turbulent years. Lenin drew up the plan for the electrification of all of Russia and decided to first build the Soviet's first power station in Shatura, near Moscow.

    Socialist construction was a new subject for the proletariat who had become the master of the country and the Bolshevik Party who were the leaders of the country. Grasping the huge machine of building a new life in their hands, and organizing the people who had just been liberated from the shackles of capitalism into the ranks of this conscious building of life, was a difficult job with absolutely no experience. It required the strong leadership of the Party and the selfless leading role of the Communist Party members to open up a path of victorious advance on the construction front.

    The film "The Communist," through the construction life of the Shatura power station, truly reflects this great struggle of historical significance. The markets, stations, and carriages filled with the noise of speculators and peddlers, the frantic sabotage, theft, and conspiracies of the Soviet enemies, could not cover up the mainstream of the new life. In the Kremlin, Lenin was presiding over a meeting to discuss the national electrification; in Shatura, those "wearing boots or military shoes, leggings, and tattered clothes left over from the defeated battlefields of the imperialist war," crossed the swampy areas, sparse forests, and thorny thickets, rushing to the first construction site of this new life. Hundreds of thousands of ordinary Russians, enduring famine and hardship, actively participated in the labor of building the power station. In them, we saw the noble qualities of ordinary Soviet people who were growing up. This quality is even more prominent and distinct in the protagonist of the film, the young Communist Party member Vasily Gubanov.

    The famous saying "Communists are made of special material" has been viciously ridiculed and attacked by many right-wing elements, who have falsely accused it as an arrogant expression of the Communist Party considering itself superior. This is a malicious distortion. Neither the title of Communist nor this famous saying has anything in common with concepts such as "superiority" or "lack of humility." The reason why a Communist Party member has become a political life that progressive mankind yearns for and pursues is because he represents the spirit of striving and dedicating himself to the great ideals of mankind. A Communist Party member is one of millions of ordinary laborers. If they have anything "special," it is because they have unwavering faith and a tenacious will to fight selflessly for the liberation of mankind, even at the cost of bloodshed and sacrifice. This is the education and training that the great Party has given them, and the glorious guide to their actions. The film "The Communist" profoundly expresses this truth with the image of Vasily Gubanov.

    The outstanding impression Gubanov gives people is his infinite loyalty to the cause of the Party and the selfless fighting spirit to complete the tasks assigned by the Party. As long as he understood the needs of the Party, as long as the Party assigned him a job, he immediately took action in a fighting posture. To get the nails needed for the construction site, he ran all over Moscow; to find the train carrying grain from Moscow, he trekked on foot. When he discovered that the train had broken down halfway due to lack of fuel, and the lazy train personnel would rather sleep than try to find a solution, he immediately forgot his fatigue and took an axe to cut down trees himself, because thousands of people in Shatura were waiting for this car of grain while starving. The train personnel were finally moved by his selfless spirit, and with a sense of guilt, came out to help him cut down trees... The train finally started, but just as it was about to reach Shatura, it was attacked by armed bandits. Gubanov sacrificed himself, but even at the last moment of his life, he fought tenaciously with the bandits.

    Of course, Communist Party members are not mythical figures. They came out of the old world, and like ordinary people, they also have traces of the influence of the old world remaining on them. However, under the education of the Party, they can overcome these ideological obstacles and consciously dedicate everything they have to the cause of the Party. When Gubanov came to the hydropower station construction site, he did not immediately realize the significance of his work. When the Party organization assigned him to work in the warehouse, he was furious, thinking it was an insult to him. He, a person who had shed blood in the war, could not be a "weighman" or "sell herring"! He also had pain and struggle in love. He fell passionately in love with a woman, but she was a married woman. However, no matter what confused ideas he had at work, or what wrong ideas he had in love, under the education and criticism of the Party, he corrected them and bravely threw himself into battle.

    Gubanov was an ordinary person, but his life was one that radiated the brilliance of battle. Just as the Party leader in Shatura, Khlomchenko, said in the film: "What he asks of the Party is not treatment, not status, but truth... In him lies such a rich vitality, such a deep confidence, such a tenacious will, that one feels that even death cannot defeat him!"

    Although Gubanov died, his noble qualities as a Communist Party member sowed the seeds of revolution in people's hearts. The old driver expressed everyone's belief: "Let us all be like him, forever like him!"

    在十月的光芒下
    ——谈苏联影片“共产党员”
    伊默
    苏维埃共和国从它诞生的第一天起，就开始和国内外一切反动势力进行殊死的战斗。敌人不仅对它进行了残酷的军事围剿，而且还用尽了可以利用的手段——破坏交通运输线，断绝燃料供应，囤积、垄断粮食制造饥荒，迫使工厂停工，人民失业，来扼死年轻的苏维埃国家。然而，满怀信心的俄国无产阶级，在伟大的列宁和布尔什维克党的领导下，却就是在那动荡不安的年头开始建设社会主义祖国。列宁拟定了全俄电气化的计划，并且决定首先在莫斯科附近的沙图拉建设苏维埃第一个发电站。
    社会主义建设，这对于成为国家主人的无产阶级和国家领导者的布尔什维克党来说，是一个新的课题。把建设新生活这个庞大的机器掌握在自己的手里，以及把刚刚从资本主义枷锁下解放出来的人民，组织到这自觉的建设生活的行列里来，是完全没有经验的艰巨工作。它需要党的坚强领导，需要共产党员的忘我的带头作用，才能开辟出一条建设战线上胜利前进的路。
    影片“共产党员”，通过沙图拉电站的建设生活，真实地反映了这具有历史意义的伟大斗争。那充斥着投机商和跑单帮小贩喧嚣声的市场、车站、车厢，那些苏维埃敌人疯狂的怠工、盗窃和阴谋破坏活动，都掩盖不住新生活的主流，在克里姆林宫，列宁正在主持讨论全国电气化的会议；在沙图拉，那些“穿着皮靴或军便鞋，打着绑腿，穿着从帝国主义战争失败的战场上残留下来的褴褛衣衫”的人群，穿过沼泽地带，穿过稀疏的矮林，穿过荆棘丛生的灌木丛，奔向这新生活建设的第一个工地。成千上万的普通俄罗斯人，忍受着饥荒和困难，积极参加建设电站的劳动。在他们的身上，我们看到了正在成长的普通苏维埃人的崇高品质。这种品质在影片主人公青年共产党员瓦西里·古班诺夫的身上，表现得更加突出和鲜明。
    “共产党员是特殊材料制成的”这句有名的话，曾经受到过许多右派分子恶毒的嘲笑和攻击，他们诬蔑这是共产党自居高人一等的不谦虚的表现。这是恶意的歪曲。无论是共产党这个称号或者是这句名言，都和“高人一等”“不谦虚”等概念，毫无相通之处。共产党员，所以成为进步人类向往、追求的政治生命，那是因为他代表着为伟大的人类理想而奋斗、献身的精神。共产党员是千百万普通劳动者中间的一个。如果说他们有“特殊”处，那是因为他们有坚定不移的信仰，为了人类解放进行忘我斗争甚至不惜流血牺牲的顽强意志。这才是伟大的党给他们的教育和培养，给他们的光荣的行动指南。影片“共产党员”用瓦西里·古班诺夫的形象，深刻地表现了这个真理。
    古班诺夫给人们的突出的印象是，他对于党的事业的无限忠诚，和那种为了完成党的任务的忘我的战斗精神。只要是他了解了党的需要，只要是党分配给他的工作，他就立刻以战斗的姿态行动起来。为了得到建设工地所需要的钉子，他跑遍了莫斯科；为了寻找那辆从莫斯科开来的运载粮食的火车，他就徒步跋涉去寻找。等到他发现这辆车由于没有燃料半途抛锚，而懒散的列车人员却宁肯睡大觉不去想办法解决的时候，他立刻就忘记了疲劳，一个人拿斧子去砍伐树木，因为沙图拉成千上万的人，挨着饿在等待着这车粮食。列车人员终于在他这种忘我精神的感召下，怀着负疚的心情走出来帮助他砍伐树木……列车终于开动了，可是，就在快到达沙图拉的时候，却遭到武装匪徒的袭击。古班诺夫牺牲了，然而，就是他的生命的最后一刻，他也和匪徒们进行了顽强的搏斗。
    当然，共产党员不是神话里的人物，他们从旧世界走出来，他们像一般人一样，也有旧世界影响残留在他们身上的痕迹，但是，他们能够在党的教育下，克服这些思想障碍，自觉地把自己的一切贡献给党的事业。古班诺夫来到了水电站工地，并不是一下子就认识了自己工作的意义。当党的组织分配他去做仓库管理工作的时候，他曾经发过火，认为这是侮辱他，他，一个在战争里流过血的人，不能去当“司秤员”、去“卖青鱼”！在爱情上，他也有过痛苦和斗争。他热烈地爱上了一个女人，但她却是一个有夫之妇。不过，不管他在工作上有过什么糊涂的观念，爱情上有过什么错误的思想，在党的教育和批评下，他都纠正过来，并且勇敢地投入了战斗。
    古班诺夫是一个平凡的人，而他的一生，却是散发着战斗光辉的一生，正像影片中的沙图拉的党的领导人赫洛姆钦科所说的：“他所要求于党的，不是待遇，不是地位，他是向党寻求真理的，……在他身上蕴藏着这样丰富的生命力，这样深厚的信心，这样顽强的意志，使人觉得，就是死亡也不能战胜他！”
    古班诺夫虽然死了，他的崇高的共产党员的品质，却在人们的身上，播下了革命的种子。那年老的司机说出了大家的信念：“就让我们大家都像他一样，永远像他一样吧！”
