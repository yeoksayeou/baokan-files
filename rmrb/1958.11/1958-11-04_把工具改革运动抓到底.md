The tool reform movement, which developed along with the great leap forward in agriculture, is paving the way for China's agriculture to move from semi-mechanization to mechanization and electrification. Now, this movement has been going on for nearly a year. What achievements and experiences have we gained? How should the tool reform movement be carried out in the future? As the new agricultural production year – the 1959 agricultural greater leap forward – is about to begin, it is very necessary to summarize the experience of the tool reform movement, draw necessary lessons from it, and determine the direction of continued progress.

The tool reform movement has achieved tremendous successes. According to statistics from relevant departments, as of November 1, more than 320 million improved agricultural tools of various types have been popularized nationwide. Eight provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities, including Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Xinjiang, and Beijing, have completed this year's plan for promoting improved tools. More than 780 counties have achieved roller bearingization. The promotion of rope-drawing machines has also made great progress, with Jiangsu and Shanghai having completed the promotion plan. The heavy agricultural tools that have been used for thousands of years are being replaced by more efficient new agricultural tools. However, the important achievement is that after a year of tool reform movement, we have a complete set of improved or new agricultural tools and implements from cultivation to harvest to agricultural product processing. Cadres at all levels have accumulated rich experience in leading the tool reform movement. With these two points, things will be easier in the future. By making good use of and developing these two points, we will be able to push the tool reform movement to a higher stage of development more easily, and we will be able to realize the mechanization and electrification of China's agriculture step by step more easily.

However, this year's tool reform movement also has shortcomings: the movement has developed very unevenly. Many provinces and cities have completed the promotion plan for improved tools, while some provinces have not completed it, and some are even far behind. Even in the same region, the progress of the movement is also uneven. Before late August, the tool reform movement in most parts of the country was carried out vigorously and vividly; after entering September, the movement gradually slowed down, and this situation became more serious in late September. In many areas, the tool reform movement almost came to a standstill.

"Great efforts in iron and steel production and the 'three autumn' work are all urgent tasks to be completed within a limited time, so we can't take care of tool reform!" Some comrades explained the recent sluggish progress of the tool reform movement in this way. Is this the truth? It is true, but it is not the fundamental reason. Jiangsu and Shandong are examples. These two provinces are also making great efforts in iron and steel production and also making a sprint in the 'three autumn' work, but their tool reform movement has not been affected, but has accelerated: Jiangsu has completed the promotion plan for rope-drawing machines ahead of schedule, and Shandong has been advancing at a speed of promoting 50,000 rope-drawing machines every day since mid-October. From the facts of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, we can draw the conclusion: the most fundamental reason for the recent sluggish progress of the tool reform movement in some areas is that the leaders there have relaxed their leadership over this movement, and have not done as the comrades in Jiangsu and Shandong have done: the more intense the production, the more insufficient the labor force, the more we must make great efforts in the tool reform movement. Therefore, the tool reform movement in these areas has stagnated and fallen behind.

Examining the history of China's tool reform movement can also illustrate this problem. Why didn't a large-scale tool reform movement like this year appear in the past or even last year and the year before? It is because there was no such a great leap forward in production and construction as this year. Under the scale and speed of production at that time, there was no or little labor shortage at all, and even the use of old tools could barely cope with it; if there was occasionally a labor shortage, it would pass with overtime work and extra effort. This year, as soon as the situation of the great leap forward in socialist construction appeared, things were different. It was no longer possible to adapt to the needs of the great leap forward situation by relying solely on overtime work and increasing labor intensity. It was no longer possible to solve the difficulty of labor shortage. What should we do? There are many ways, but the most fundamental and important is to improve labor productivity and greatly develop social productive forces.

Through what ways can we improve labor productivity and develop social productive forces? Marxism believes that the relations of production are the basic and decisive factors in promoting the development of productive forces. In our country, with the victory of the socialist revolution and the victory of the people's commune movement, this problem has been solved. The relations of production in our country are suitable for the development of productive forces. Although we still need to constantly pay attention to adjusting the imbalances in certain links, it is not a fundamental transformation problem of "major changes." In the future, the main way to improve labor productivity is to reform tools. The view that "the task of production and construction is too heavy and the labor force is too tight, so there is no strength to carry out tool reform" is obviously wrong. Precisely because we want a great leap forward, precisely because of the labor shortage, we must vigorously carry out the technical revolution and the tool reform movement. Only by vigorously carrying out the tool reform movement can we ensure that our country's socialist construction undertakings can leap forward on a larger scale and at a higher speed; only then can we liberate ourselves from the passive state of labor shortage, and only then can we fundamentally solve the problem of labor shortage in our country. This is the basic conclusion we have drawn from this year's tool reform movement. The recent slow progress of the tool reform movement in many areas is certainly due to improper work arrangements, failing to divide battle lines, establish tool reform professional teams, and launch mass movements as in Jiangsu and Shandong; the main problem is still the ideological understanding. Some comrades did not correctly understand that, in the specific circumstances of our country, reforming tools and implementing the technical revolution are the fundamental key to developing productive forces and improving labor productivity; they did not correctly understand that developing productive forces and improving labor productivity are the fundamental key to solving the labor shortage; they did not correctly understand that carrying out tool reform and implementing the technical revolution are the fundamental ways to build a modern agriculture in our country and realize mechanization and electrification. Because of this reason, they either relaxed their leadership over this movement; or waited for mechanization and looked down on improved agricultural tools; or they could not correctly grasp the law of development of the tool reform movement - improved tools can only be gradually completed in the process of promotion and use, but held the idea of "perfection" and "one step to the sky." Therefore, they only paid attention to invention and creation, but ignored promotion and use, and remained in the stage of looking at drawings and experimenting and performing for a long time, without large-scale and universal promotion and other phenomena. Therefore, when encountering a little "difficulty" - such as urgent tasks such as iron and steel and the "three autumns" - the tool reform movement was affected or even squeezed out, and the tool reform movement was not carried through to the end.

1958 is the first year of the "three years of hard struggle." This year's great leap forward is only the first glimpse, only the first battle. Next year, our country's industrial and agricultural production and other socialist construction undertakings will have a greater leap forward, and the labor shortage will be more serious than this year. According to estimates from nine provinces in the north, there is generally a shortage of about half of the labor force, and some provinces even lack two-thirds. Comrade Shaoqi said that this is a good thing. Isn't it? In a large country with 650 million people, not only is there no unemployment problem, not only is the problem of full employment fundamentally solved, but also there is a feeling of "labor shortage." Isn't this the most eloquent proof that our socialist system has unparalleled superiority over the capitalist system? Isn't it precisely because our country's construction undertakings are leaping forward on an unprecedented scale and speed? Isn't it precisely because our country will be able to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in the shortest time? The labor shortage is a great thing because it forces us to tap labor potential and forces us to carry out the technical revolution movement and vigorously carry out tool reform. All this will greatly improve China's labor productivity and greatly develop China's socialist productive forces. Lenin once said: Ultimately, labor productivity is the fundamental factor that determines the victory of the socialist system over the capitalist system. Comrade Shaoqi also pointed out in his report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party on behalf of the Central Committee: The purpose of the revolution is to develop social productive forces. We must fundamentally understand this issue. Party committees at all levels must further strengthen their leadership over the tool reform movement, especially those areas where the tool reform movement has lagged behind must be grasped tightly.

To further carry out the tool reform movement, two issues must be resolved: the issue of leadership and the issue of the guidelines and tasks of the tool reform movement.

Whether the tool reform movement is carried out well or not, as mentioned above, the key lies in leadership. Strengthening leadership should implement three principles: first, carry the tool reform movement through to the end, and do not be tight and loose from time to time; second, vigorously launch mass movements, and do not rely solely on a few "skilled craftsmen"; third, divide battle lines, establish tool reform professional teams and farm tool factories, and combine invention, creation, promotion, and use. Do not squeeze out the tool reform because other work tasks are tight.

The guidelines and tasks of the tool reform movement in the future should be: comprehensive reform. Not only should we reform the tools for grain crops, but also the tools for cash crops; not only should we reform the tools for cultivation and harvesting, but also the processing tools; not only should we reform the production tools, but also the farmland water conservancy basic construction tools and the collective living tools of the people's communes (such as kitchen cooking tools), etc. In carrying out comprehensive tool reform, all localities should conduct reforms in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner according to specific circumstances. Generally speaking, all localities should first focus on the following four aspects:

First, vigorously carry out the roller bearingization movement of transportation tools, especially to improve transportation tools. Ensure the completion of the plan proposed by the provinces at the National Tool Reform Telephone Conference convened by the Central Committee in August this year on schedule. The roller bearingization of transportation tools is the main symbol of the current realization of agricultural semi-mechanization in China, and the labor used for transportation accounts for the largest proportion of the various labor uses in rural areas. Therefore, areas that have not yet achieved cartization should realize cartization, and areas that have already achieved cartization should build and improve roads to achieve roller bearingization; promote wood railization and trailerization, and where conditions permit, rubber tires should be used to replace iron-wheeled carts as much as possible. Taking these measures can increase transportation efficiency by one to several times. According to estimates from nine provinces and cities in the north, this item alone can save 4 to 5 billion labor days. Therefore, it is very necessary to make it the focus of tool reform this winter, combine it with the heavy transportation tasks, farmland basic construction, and manure accumulation movement in winter, organize a mass movement, and realize cartization and roller bearingization of transportation tools.

Secondly, vigorously promote rope-drawing machines. Rope-drawing machines can not only plow deeply, but also harrow, fertilize, cultivate, weed, and harvest. Jiangsu, Shandong, and other places have begun to comprehensively utilize it. Now it seems that the rope-drawing machine is very likely to be a way for China to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification. All localities must conscientiously promote it, and must complete the universal promotion of rope-drawing machines and comprehensive operations this winter and next spring.

Again, vigorously develop power energy, especially water, wind, and biogas energy. In the current situation where China still lacks electricity and mechanical power, the large-scale use of water, wind, and biogas energy is of particular importance. This is the fundamental way to solve the shortage of manpower and animal power. According to the practice of various places, a windmill generally has 4 horsepower; one cubic meter of biogas fermentation liquid can generate 1 horsepower; a human and animal-powered winch uses ropes to draw and plow the land, and one person can top one cow, and one cow can top the power of three cows. As long as everyone starts, vigorously carries out mass movements, it is not difficult to increase tens of millions or hundreds of millions of horsepower in the country in a short period of time.

Finally, all localities should, in the near future, promote the various improved tools created and invented by the masses this year, as long as they have been tested and generally recognized as capable of being promoted. Strive to use efficient improved agricultural tools for field operations from cultivation and harvesting to processing next year.

These are the tasks and requirements of tool reform in the future. Now, there are still two months left before the end of the year, and only four or five months left before the spring plowing next year. In order to strive for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year and to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification more quickly, a more extensive, more practical, and more effective tool reform movement must be carried out in all parts of the country this winter and next spring.

    把工具改革运动抓到底
    随着农业大跃进发展起来的工具改革运动，正开辟着我国农业经过半机械化走向机械化、电气化的道路。现在，这个运动已经进行了将近一年，究竟我们得到了一些什么样的成就和经验呢？今后的工具改革运动应该怎样进行呢？在这新的农业生产年度——1959年农业更大跃进即将开始的时候，总结一下工具改革运动的经验，从中吸取必要的教训，确定继续前进的方针是十分必要的。
    工具改革运动获得了十分巨大的成就。据有关部门统计，到11月1日全国已经推广各种改良农具三亿二千多万件，河南、江苏、山东、广西、湖南、广东和新疆、北京等八个省（自治区）市已经完成今年全部的推广改良工具的规划；已经有七百八十多个县实现了滚珠轴承化；绳索牵引机的推广工作也有很大进展，江苏、上海已经完成推广规划。沿用几千年的笨重的农具，正在为效率更高的新农具所代替。但重要的成就还是经过一年来的工具改革运动，我们有了从耕作到收获到农产品加工的一整套的改良的或新式农具和工具；各级干部积累了丰富的领导工具改革运动的经验。有了这两条，今后的事情就比较好办了。很好地运用和发展这两条，我们就能够比较容易地把工具改革运动推向更高的发展阶段，就能够比较容易地一步一步地实现我国农业的机械化和电气化。
    但是，今年我国工具改革运动也有缺点：运动发展得很不平衡。有不少省市已经完成了改良工具的推广规划，有些省还没有完成，甚至差得很远。就是在同一地区，运动的进展也是不平衡的。8月下旬以前，全国大部分地区工具改革运动进行得轰轰烈烈，有声有色；进入9月以后，运动便逐渐缓慢起来，到9月下旬这一情况更为严重，不少地区的工具改革运动几乎陷于停顿状态。
    “大搞钢铁，三秋工作，都是限期完成的紧急任务，顾不上搞工具改革了！”有些同志这样解释最近时期工具改革运动进展迟缓。这是不是事实呢？是事实。但却不是根本的原因。江苏和山东就是例子。这两个省也在大搞钢铁，也在突击三秋工作，可是他们的工具改革运动，不仅没有受影响，反而加快了脚步：江苏提前完成了绳索牵引机的推广规划，山东从10月中旬以后，每天推广五万部绳索牵引机的速度向前猛进。从江苏、山东两省的事实中，就可以得出结论：有些地区最近工具改革运动进展迟缓，最根本的原因是那里的领导干部放松了对这一运动的领导，没有像江苏、山东的同志们那样：生产越是紧张，劳动力越是不足，就越要大搞工具改革运动。因此，这些地区的工具改革运动便停滞下来了，落后了。
    考察一下我国工具改革运动的历史，也可以说明这一问题。为什么在过去甚至在去年、前年没有出现像今年这样大规模的工具改革运动呢？就是因为那时没有像今年这样的生产建设大跃进。在当时那样的生产规模和速度下，根本不发生或很少发生劳动力紧张的情况，就是运用旧的工具也能勉强对付过去；偶而有劳力不足的情况发生，加加班、努把力也就过去了。今年，社会主义建设大跃进的形势一出现，事情就不同了，单靠加班加点和增加劳动强度已经不能适应大跃进形势的需要了，已经不能解决劳动力紧张的困难了。怎么办呢？办法多得很，但最根本最主要的是提高劳动生产率，是大大发展社会生产力。
    通过什么样的途径去提高劳动生产率和发展社会生产力呢？马克思主义认为：生产关系是促进生产力发展的基本的决定的因素。在我国随着社会主义革命的胜利，随着人民公社化运动的胜利，这个问题已经解决了。我国的生产关系是适合生产力发展的，虽然还需要经常不断地注意调节某些环节上的失调现象，但不是“大动干戈”的根本性的改造问题了。今后提高劳动生产率主要是改革工具的问题了。那种认为“生产建设任务太重，劳力太紧，因而没有力量进行工具改革”的观点显然是不对的。正因为要大跃进，正因为劳动力紧张，我们才必须大搞技术革命，大搞工具改革运动。只有大搞工具改革运动，才能保证我国各项社会主义建设事业能够以更大的规模、更高的速度向前跃进；才能使我们 从劳动力紧张的被动状态中解放出来，才能从根本上解决我国劳动力不足的问题。这就是我们从今年工具改革运动中取得的基本结论。很多地区最近工具改革运动进展缓慢，固然由于工作安排不当，没有像江苏、山东等地那样划分战线、建立工具改革专业队和大搞群众运动；更主要的还是思想认识问题。有些同志没有正确理解在我国的具体情况下，改革工具实行技术革命是发展生产力和提高劳动生产率的根本关键；没有正确理解发展生产力和提高劳动生产率是解决劳动力紧张的根本关键；没有正确理解进行工具改革实行技术革命是建设我国现代化农业，实现机械化、电气化的根本道路。就是因为这种原故，便产生了或者放松了对这一运动的领导；或者等待机械化，看不起改良农具；或者不能正确掌握工具改革运动的发展规律——改良工具只有在推广使用中才能逐渐完全起来，而是抱着“十全十美”“一步登天”的思想。因之便只注意发明创造，却忽视推广使用，长期地停留在看图画纸，试验表演的阶段，没有大量的普遍的推广等等现象。因此，遇到一点“困难”——譬如钢铁、三秋等紧急任务一来，便影响甚至挤掉了工具改革运动，没有把工具改革运动抓到底。
    1958年是“三年苦战”的第一年。今年的大跃进只是初露锋芒，只是初战。明年我们国家的工农业生产和其他社会主义建设事业将有更大的跃进，劳动力不足的情况比今年还要严重。据北方九省估算，一般都差一半左右的劳动力，有的省甚至缺少三分之二。少奇同志说过这是一件好事。不是吗？在六亿五千万人口的大国里，不仅没有失业问题，不仅根本上解决了全民就业问题，而且感到“劳力不足”，这不是最雄辩地证明了我们的社会主义制度比资本主义制度具有无比的优越性吗？不正是说明我们国家的建设事业正在以史无前例的规模和速度向前跃进吗？不正是说明我们国家在最短的时间内就能够赶上和超过世界上最发达的资本主义国家吗？劳动力紧张所以是一件大好事，还在于它逼着我们去挖掘劳动潜力，逼着我们开展技术革命运动，大搞工具改革。这一切必将大大提高我国的劳动生产率，必将大大发展我国的社会主义生产力。列宁曾经说过：归根到底劳动生产率是决定社会主义制度战胜资本主义制度的根本的因素。少奇同志代表中央向党的八大二次会议的报告中也指出：革命的目的就是为了发展社会生产力。我们必须从根本上认识这个问题。各级党委必须进一步加强对工具改革运动的领导，特别是工具改革运动落后了的地区更要抓紧。
    进一步开展工具改革运动要解决两个问题：领导问题和工具改革运动的方针任务问题。
    工具改革运动进行得好不好，如前所述关键在于领导。加强领导应该贯彻三条原则：一曰把工具改革运动抓到底，不能时紧时松；二曰大搞群众运动，不能单靠少数“能工巧匠”去搞；三曰划分战线，建立工具改革专业队和农具厂，并把发明、创造、推广、使用四者结合起来。不能因为其他工作任务一紧，便把工具改革挤掉。
    今后工具改革运动的方针任务应该是：全面改革。不仅要改革粮食作物的工具，还要改革经济作物的工具；不仅要改革耕种、收获的工具，还要改革加工工具；不仅要改革生产工具，还要改革农田水利基本建设工具和人民公社集体生活工具（如食堂炊事工具）等等。在进行全面的工具改革中，各地应该根据具体情况，有计划有步骤有重点地进行改革，一般说来，各地都应该首先抓住下面四个方面：
    第一，大搞运转工具滚珠轴承化运动，特别是改善交通运输工具。保证按期完成今年8月各省在中央召开的全国工具改革电话会议提出的规划。运转工具滚珠轴承化是我国当前实现农业半机械化的主要标志，而运输用工又在农村各项用工中占的比重最大。因此，要在没有实现车子化的地方实现车子化，已经车子化的地方要修建和改良道路，实现滚珠轴承化；推广木轨化、拖车化，有条件的地方还应该尽可能用胶皮轮代替铁轮车。采取这些措施就能使运输效率提高一倍到几倍。据北方九省市估算，只此一项就可以节省劳动日四、五十亿。所以很有必要把它作为今冬工具改革的重点，结合冬季繁重的运输任务、农田基本建设和积肥运动，组织一个群众性的运动，实现车子化和运输工具滚珠轴承化。
    其次要大搞绳索牵引机。绳索牵引机不仅能深耕，还能耙地、施肥、中耕锄草以及收获等，江苏、山东等地已开展了对它的综合利用。现在看来绳索牵引机很可能是我国实现农业机械化、电气化的一条道路，各地务必认真推广，一定要在今冬明春完成绳索牵引机的普遍推广工作和综合作业。
    再次要大搞动力能源，特别是大搞水力、风力和沼气能源。在目前我国尚缺乏电力和机械动力的情况下，大量运用水力、风力、沼气能源有特别重要的意义，这是解决人力、畜力不足的根本办法。根据各地实践，一部风车一般有四马力的动力；一立方公尺的沼气发酵液，能产生一马力的动力；一台人畜力绞关，用绳索牵引犁耕地，一个人能顶一头牛，一头牛能顶三头牛的力气。只要大家动手，大搞群众运动，在短期间内全国增加几千万、上亿马力的动力是不难办到的。
    最后，各地应在最近期间，把今年群众创造发明的各种改良工具，只要是经过试验和大家公认能够推广的，就应该定任务、定期限，下决心加以推广。争取明年田间作业从耕作、收获到加工都要使用效率高的改良农具。
    这就是今后工具改革的任务和要求。现在，距年终还有两个月，距明年春耕也只有四、五个月的时间了。为争取明年农业生产的更大跃进，为更快地实现农业机械化和电气化，在今冬明春全国各地都要开展一个更广泛、更踏实、更有成效的工具改革运动。
