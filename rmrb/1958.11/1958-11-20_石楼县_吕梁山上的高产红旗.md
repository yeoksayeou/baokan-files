    Shilou County – A High-Yield Red Banner on the Lüliang Mountains
    CCP Jinan Regional Committee
    Editor's Note: Shilou County, Shanxi Province, has established a basic farmland system, resolutely changing the extensive and low-yield farming system to one of intensive cultivation with high yields. This year, the per-mu grain yield has jumped from 49 jin last year to 1,004 jin, completely transforming the backward production situation. This experience is worthy of attention.
    Located in the western Shanxi plateau, and known as a "barren land," Shilou County, Shanxi, has completely changed its low-yield appearance after a year of hard work, with grain production soaring. Out of the county's 120,000 mu of basic farmland, excluding 27,000 mu of cash crops, the 93,000 mu of grain fields produced a total of 93,372,000 jin of grain this year, an average yield of 1,004 jin per mu. Compared to the 49 jin per mu in 1957, this is an increase of 19.5 times; even compared to the bumper harvest of 1956, with 74 jin per mu, it is an increase of 12.6 times. The total grain production of the county this year is 103,830,000 jin, an increase of 5.1 times compared to the total grain production in 1957, which is equal to 90% of the total grain production of the past five years (1953 to 1957). Calculated on the basis of the county's 40,504 people, the average grain possession per person has increased from 427 jin last year to 2,564 jin.
    Changing from Extensive Planting and Low Yield to Intensive Planting and High Yield
    The fact that Shilou County's total grain production has increased fivefold compared to last year, and that the per-mu yield has broken the 1,000-jin mark, may be unbelievable to some people. This is because the county is located at a high altitude, 1,200 meters above sea level; the climate is cold, with a frost-free period of only 130 days; soil erosion is serious, with 45.96 million cubic meters of sediment flowing into the Yellow River every year; ridges and mounds are numerous, and gullies are all over the place; the population is sparse, and the land is barren, with an average of only ten people per square kilometer. The county originally had 380,000 mu of cultivated land, with nearly ten mu per person on average. More than 90% of these lands are distributed on the tops and waists of loess ridges and gullies, all of which are steep slopes of about 50 degrees, so-called "hanging" lands, making cultivation extremely difficult. It has always been a low-yield area where "five-tenths of seedlings emerging is considered a bumper harvest" and "good years are when grain exceeds a dou (30 jin per mu)." According to those who prioritize conditions, this place could never produce 1,000 jin of grain. However, it is precisely in this "barren land" that the per-mu grain yield has reached over 1,000 jin this year.
    The main experience of Shilou County's leap from "barren land" to a 1,000-jin county is the revolutionary measures taken in the cultivation system and basic farmland construction. That is, resolutely abandoning the old road of extensive planting and low yield, and resolutely taking the new road of cultivating less land but cultivating it well. The county has reduced its cultivated land from 380,000 mu last year to 120,000 mu of basic farmland, averaging three mu per person. And on the fallow slopes, vigorous afforestation and planting of pasture are carried out. This spring and summer, 141,000 mu have been afforested and 20,000 mu of pasture have been planted. In the work of establishing basic farmland, 98,000 mu of dam construction projects have been completed in the loess gullies, combined with soil cutting and ditch filling, implementing the principle of filling ditches, sowing seeds, and obtaining benefits in the same year. At the same time, special attention has been paid to flood siltation and water conservancy construction, and 50,000 mu of land have been silted up by floods (of which more than 30,000 mu have been planted with autumn grain crops this year). On the original 41,000 mu of ditch and river land, land leveling and water conservancy construction have been vigorously carried out, and the irrigated area has increased from the original 500 mu to 13,000 mu. Coupled with increased fertilizer application and intensive cultivation, the total output of these 71,700 mu of basic farmland alone is equal to 4.6 times the total output of last year. Zheng Tingliang, a member of the Zhuangxi Commune, said: "In the past, one mu of land, even with the stalks, could carry at most two dan. This year, the basic farmland, one mu of corn, just the ears, can carry twenty dan, and with the stalks, two hundred dan can't carry it all. It's true that good land doesn't count by the mu, one mu is worth a hundred mu."
    The fact of Shilou County's unprecedented bumper harvest shows that establishing a basic farmland system centered on ditch siltation is the correct direction for transforming nature in mountainous and rocky areas. First, only by abandoning extensive planting and low yield can we concentrate our efforts on building basic farmland well, increase fertilizer application on basic farmland, cultivate intensively, and gradually realize garden-like cultivation. Second, the establishment of basic farmland centered on ditch siltation, moving cultivated land from the mountainsides to the mountain gullies, can conserve water and retain moisture, and can use the spring water in the gullies and the floodwater from the mountains for irrigation, rapidly realizing water conservancy. It can also maximize the use of decaying grass and wood on the slopes, increasing the fertility of the land. Because the gully land is flat, transportation is convenient, it is easy to cultivate, and it is convenient to implement vehicle transportation and also to realize mechanized cultivation in the future. Third, after the slope land is fallowed, a large number of trees can be planted, pasture can be cultivated, mountains can be closed for afforestation and grass cultivation, combined with dam construction and land siltation in the gullies, water and soil can be quickly and effectively conserved, and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and other diversified economies can be gradually developed.
    Sharp Struggle among County Committee Members
    The proposal to establish a basic farmland system is the result of combining leadership and practice. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, through vigorous water and soil conservation and efforts to develop production, the impoverished face of Shilou County has undergone significant changes. However, the question of how to fundamentally and rapidly change the low-yield and impoverished state has not been well resolved. Since the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of people have been extremely eager to change the low-yield and impoverished state. It was at this time that Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, and Zhao Yuting, First Secretary of the Jinan Regional Party Committee, and other leading comrades, inspected the production and living conditions in the mountainous areas of southern Shanxi, and in January this year, convened a meeting of the First Secretaries of the seven western Shanxi counties in Xinning County, making a decision to establish basic farmland in mountainous areas and formulating a ten-year long-term plan for establishing mountainous areas. In this way, the timely decision-making of the leadership and the urgent demands of the broad masses of people were combined.
    However, what kind of basic farmland should be established? What speed and method should be adopted to establish basic farmland? When the Standing Committee of the Shilou County Party Committee first discussed this issue, there were two views. Liu Baoyu, the County Party Secretary, and Li Guangyi, the Deputy Secretary, advocated taking revolutionary measures to completely fallow the 340,000 mu of steep slope land on the loess gullies and slopes, returning it to forests and grassland; and adopting the method of damming and silting up gully land and constructing existing gully and river land to establish new types of basic farmland. Fan Tianqing, the County Propaganda Minister, firmly opposed this. He advocated selecting a portion of the better slope land in the existing cultivated land to build terraces as basic farmland. He mechanically believed that damming and silting up gully land did not conform to the principle of "governing from top to bottom," and determined that fallowing slope land was "risky"; damming and silting up gully land was "wasteful and fruitless." Qiang Shuan'yu, the County Magistrate, adopted an ambiguous liberal attitude, saying: "Damming and silting up gully land can work, and it can't work." Four members of the County Standing Committee put forward three different opinions, and they argued endlessly and could not reach a conclusion. Therefore, it was decided that Li Guangyi and Fan Tianqing would go down to investigate. Comrade Li Guangyi spent ten days with township and commune cadres, carefully surveying twelve representative gullies in six townships, taking a cursory look at thirty gullies, and using the mass line method to summarize the experience of the Qianjin Commune of Yidie Township in fallowing slope land and damming and silting up gully land in the Xinyi Gully. The Xinyi Gully is three Chinese miles long, and originally suffered from severe soil erosion. There were 380 mu of steep slope land on the gullies, with a grain yield of only 30 to 40 jin per mu. In order to change this situation, they built dams in this gully to silt up land from 1955. In two years, 40 mu of gully land were silted up, with a total grain output of 24,000 jin, an average yield of 600 jin per mu, equal to 1.5 times the total output of the original 380 mu of slope land. While building dams and silting up land, all 380 mu of steep land were fallowed, and 290 mu of alfalfa and sweet clover were planted, and 98,000 trees were planted. Now, the pasture on the gullies is already two or three chi high, and the small trees have also grown. In the past three years, no soil or water has been lost in this gully. In the first two years, although the grass and trees on the gullies had not yet grown, all the lost soil and water silted up the gully land; in the third year, the pasture and tree seedlings grew up, ensuring that soil did not go down the mountains and water did not leave the gullies. The facts of the Xinyi Gully eloquently show that returning slope land to forests and grassland and establishing basic farmland centered on gully siltation can solve the two major problems of changing the low-yield state and conserving soil and water.
    The County Party Committee listened to the reports of Li Guangyi and Fan Tianqing. Fan Tianqing believed that, according to his investigation in Luocun Township, there were no gullies to dam at all, and there was no other way out except to build terraces on the slopes. Based on the reports of the two County Committee members, the County Party Committee carefully analyzed the natural conditions of the county and believed that the situation of the Xinyi Gully could basically represent the entire county. More than 80% of the county's area is loess ridge and gully area. The gullies are generally three to five Chinese miles long, making them ideal for gully land siltation. According to the investigation, there are more than 1,300 loess gullies with a length of more than one Chinese mile that can silt up about 50 mu of land, and there are nearly 10,000 gullies with a length of less than one Chinese mile. If dams are vigorously built to silt up land, the county can silt up 100,000 mu of gully land. Coupled with the existing 40,000 mu of gully and river land, each person can average at least three mu of good land. If terraces are built on steep slopes, it will not only require a lot of labor and cannot be completed in a short period of time, but even if terraces are built, it will bring great difficulties to vehicle transportation and future mechanized cultivation. After such research, eleven of the sixteen members of the County Party Committee advocated establishing basic farmland centered on "gully land siltation." However, Fan Tianqing still firmly opposed it. The entire County Party Committee then went to the Baozi Gully in Chengguan Township to observe and discuss. This gully is roughly the same as the Xinyi Gully. Through planting grass and trees on the slopes and building dams to silt up land in the gullies, not only was soil and water conserved, but also 100 mu of gully land was silted up. The facts once again struck at the conservatives and skeptics, and fifteen members of the County Party Committee unanimously agreed to the opinion of establishing basic farmland centered on gully land siltation, and only Fan Tianqing still firmly opposed it. Therefore, the County Party Committee resolutely chose the road of establishing basic farmland centered on gully land siltation.
    Then, how to build basic farmland in the shortest possible time? The County Party Committee calculated the labor force. According to the experience of Yidie Township, it takes eight workdays to dam and silt up one mu of gully land, and half a workday to create one mu of forest or plant one mu of grass. Out of the county's 18,000 laborers, 25% of the labor force will be drawn out to silt up gully land and plant grass and trees year-round, and 100,000 mu of gully land can be silted up and 200,000 to 300,000 mu of grass and trees can be planted in one year. After calculating the accounts, the County Party Committee had more confidence and determination. Therefore, it was decided to dam and silt up 80,000 mu of gully land within one year and plant trees and pasture on the fallowed slope land; and to water the original 40,000 mu of gully and river land within two years. In order to ensure the increase in grain production in the same year, the County Party Committee decided to adopt the principle of damming, cutting soil to fill ditches, sowing seeds, and striving to benefit in the same year. This relieved people's concerns that too much fallowing would affect total grain production.
    Relying on the Masses, the Momentum is Like a Broken Bamboo
    Thoroughly abandoning the farming road of extensive planting and low yield that people have been accustomed to for thousands of years and establishing a basic farmland system centered on gully land siltation is a major revolution in agricultural production, and it will inevitably encounter ideological resistance from all sides. Therefore, after the County Party Committee put forward the plan to establish basic farmland, it immediately organized the people of the county to conduct a great debate. In the debate, the broad masses of people warmly supported the County Party Committee's plan. However, some people opposed it. They believed that the County Party Committee was "talking crazy" and "bragging." "Fallowing land is risky, and silting up gully land is wasteful." In response to these arguments, the County Party Committee put forward to the people of the county: Is extensive planting and low yield good? Or is establishing basic farmland good? Which road is faster, better, and more economical? Because of the adopted method of "finding the key" and "unlocking the lock" on the spot, the mass debate was quickly led to a climax. After half a month of mass debate, the thinking was unified, the direction was clarified, everyone was ambitious, everyone was full of fighting spirit, they wrote letters of determination one after another, and oath-taking rallies were held everywhere. In this way, the County Party Committee's plan became the actual action of the masses. In the great debate, the broad masses of cadres and people also thoroughly exposed the many right-leaning conservative remarks spread by Fan Tianqing, the County Propaganda Minister, and Zhu Youhai, the Second Secretary of the Yidie Township Party Committee, as well as their full of old age and bureaucracy. At the unanimous request of the broad masses of cadres and people, the County Party Committee removed Fan Tianqing, the County Propaganda Minister and member of the County Party Committee Standing Committee, and Zhu Youhai, the Second Secretary of the Yidie Township Party Committee, from their posts.
    Such a major change will not only encounter many ideological obstacles, but also inevitably encounter many practical difficulties. For example, dam survey and design, preparation of building materials, labor organization, etc. The County Party Committee firmly grasped the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people who were eager to change the poor situation, relied on the masses, resolutely adopted the method of hard work and practical work, and solved all the difficulties.
    In order to facilitate unified action, the county established a basic farmland construction headquarters, with the three secretaries and one county magistrate serving as the chief and deputy commanders respectively. The headquarters has professional offices. A total of 200 cadres and 5,671 laborers (accounting for 32% of the total labor force) were drawn from the county to form five regiments, seventeen battalions (one battalion per township), divided into several companies, platoons, and squads. The regiment also has staff, propaganda and education, supply sections, and three professional teams for surveying, pioneering, and assault. The company is the unit, and a cooking class is set up. The forces of health care, commercial supply, and cultural entertainment are all incorporated, achieving unified leadership, collective life, eating and lodging on the construction site, and focusing on one area at a time, one township at a time. Under the command of the headquarters, in addition to one regiment conducting water conservancy construction on the original 40,000 mu of gully and river land, the remaining four regiments were fully committed to dam construction and land siltation.
    After the battle began, the problems encountered were: first, what materials to use to build the dam, and what kind of dam to build. Some people advocated that high-grade materials such as cement should be used to build foreign dams; but more people advocated taking materials locally, starting immediately, building earth dams if there was soil, and building stone dams if there were stones. The headquarters firmly supported the latter view. Second, what kind of terrain should be selected to build dams, and who should design them? In this regard, many people had no experience, and the county could not find such technical talents. What should be done? The County Party Committee immediately held "Zhuge Liang meetings," "capable people meetings," and "hero meetings" in the companies, held "suggestion platforms" and "competition platforms" (comparing the number of suggestions, good suggestions, and high-quality suggestions), and found a large number of effective local methods. The headquarters immediately drew out 200 local experts and technicians from the water conservation station who emerged from the suggestion movement and formed four professional survey teams, led by Liu Baoyu, the County Party Secretary, Gu Yangguang and Li Guangyi, the Deputy Secretaries, and Li Zhiyong, the County Magistrate, who first set off, surveying, designing, inserting signs (the signs stated the height, thickness, width, labor requirements, and other specifications and quality standards of the dam), and constructing. The survey team was responsible for inspecting each completed dam. Those that did not meet the standards were immediately reworked, ensuring that each dam met the standards. In order to improve labor efficiency and ensure project quality, political and ideological work with the general line as the guiding principle was carried out. Various construction sites universally adopted competitive methods such as "general platforms," "hero lists," "hero meetings," "celebration meetings," and "winning red flags," and launched a county-wide labor competition between the front and rear, between regiments, between battalions, between companies, between platoons, between squads, between people, between different types of work, and between different industries. Through regular and ad hoc inspections and evaluations, a large number of advanced units and heroic figures were commended, mobilizing all positive factors and inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses.
    After half a year of hard work, the county built 4,210 dams, completed 2 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, and completed 98,000 mu of dam gully land projects. 40,000 mu of original gully and river land were leveled, and 13,000 mu of water conservancy were built. Through dam gully land siltation, 20 million cubic meters of sediment were intercepted this year, equivalent to 43% of the total amount of sediment lost to the Yellow River by the county each year, which not only guaranteed a bumper harvest in agriculture, but also effectively controlled soil erosion. Through half a year of practice, the broad masses of cadres and people have gained a set of technical experiences in dam construction and land siltation. These are: (1) Select a gully mouth that is large-bellied and small-mouthed, has solid soil, and is easy to extract soil from to build a dam. (2) Build dams in sections and silt up land in blocks from the back of the gully to the front of the gully, and then gradually build a large area of gully land. (3) The gully should have slopes inside and outside, and the foundation should be solid when building the dam. (4) The spillway should be solid, and wider gullies should have spillways on both sides. (5) First divert the flood head to the wall beside the gully, so that the water head does not directly hit the dam body. (6) After the land is silted up, build reservoirs in the gully, dig spring water, and build canals to gradually make the gully land garden-like. At the same time, half a year of practice has greatly trained the people of Shilou, making people realize that nature can be conquered. Facts show that when the people have found the road to happiness, any difficulty is not worth mentioning, and all miracles will be created. Under these circumstances, all condition theorists, conservatives, and reformists can only lose again and again.
    Each Person Will Only Cultivate Two Mu of Land Next Year
    Shilou County's unprecedented bumper harvest this year is just a good start. The County Party Committee has proposed to the people of the county: in 1959, each person will only cultivate two mu of basic farmland, one mu of wheat, half a mu of autumn grain, and half a mu of cash crops. The per-mu yield will be 2,000 jin of wheat, 4,000 jin of autumn grain, 1,000 jin of seed cotton, 1,000 jin of oil, and 10,000 jin of vegetables. In order to achieve this goal, block by block basic farmland will be watered this winter and next spring, striving to achieve garden-like cultivation. Now the 40,000 people of Shilou are struggling to deeply plow 3 chi of 40,000 mu of idle autumn fields and apply 200,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu.

    石楼县——吕梁山上的高产红旗
    中共晋南地委会
    编者按：山西省石楼县建立基本农田制，坚决改变广种薄收的耕作制为少种多收，今年粮食亩产量由去年的四十九斤跃为一千零四斤，彻底改变了生产落后的面貌。这个经验值得重视。
    地处晋西高原，素称“不毛之地”的山西石楼县，经过一年苦战，彻底改变了低产面貌，粮食产量一步登天。全县十二万亩基本农田除去两万七千亩经济作物外，九万三千亩粮田，今年共产粮食九千三百三十七万二千斤，平均亩产一千零四斤。与1957年亩产四十九斤相比，增产十九倍半；与大丰收的1956年亩产七十四斤相比，也提高十二点六倍。今年全县共产粮食一亿零三百八十三万斤，与1957年粮食总产相比，增加了五点一倍，等于过去五年
  （1953至1957）粮食产量总和的90％。按全县四万零五百零四人计算，每人平均占有粮食由去年的四百二十七斤达到二千五百六十四斤。
    变广种薄收为少种多收
    今年石楼县粮食总产比去年增加五倍，亩产打破千斤关，可能有些人不会相信。因为这个县地势高亢，海拔有一千二百公尺；气候寒冷，无霜期仅仅一百三十天；水土流失严重，每年流入黄河的泥沙达四千五百九十六万立方公尺；梁峁成群，沟壑遍野，地广人稀，土地瘠薄，每一平方公里的面积上才平均有十人，全县原有耕地面积三十八万亩，每人平均近十亩。这些土地，90％以上分布在黄土梁峁沟壑的顶端和腰部，都是五十度左右的所谓“挂起来”的陡坡地，耕作条件十分困难。从来是“出苗五成算丰收”“粮食过斗（亩产三十斤）好年成”的低产地区。按照条件论者来讲，这个地方是万万产不到千斤粮的。可是，恰恰就是在这个“不毛之地”，今年粮食亩产达到了千斤以上。
    石楼县由“不毛之地”飞跃到千斤县的主要经验，是在耕作制度上和农田基本建设上采取了革命措施。这就是坚决抛弃了广种薄收的旧道路，坚决采取了种少种好的基本农田的新道路。全县由去年的三十八万亩耕地减少为十二万亩基本农田，平均每人三亩。而在停耕的坡地上，大力植树造林和种植牧草。今年春夏已经造林十四万一千亩，种植牧草两万亩。在建立基本农田的工作上，在黄土沟壑中完成了打坝工程九万八千亩，结合打坝进行了切土垫沟，执行了随垫沟、随播种、当年收益的方针。同时，特别注意了洪水淤漫和水利建设，已漫成沟地五万亩（其中有三万余亩今年种植了秋粮作物）。对原有的四万一千亩沟川地，大力进行了平整土地和水利建设，灌溉面积由原来的五百亩增加到一万三千亩。再加上增施肥料，精耕细作，仅这七万一千七百亩基本农田，总产量就等于去年总产量的四点六倍。庄西公社社员郑廷梁说：“过去一亩地连上秆子，顶多挑两担，今年的基本农田，一亩玉茭光穗子就担了二十担，连上秆子，二百担也担不完。真是好田不论亩，一亩顶百亩。”
    石楼县空前大丰收的事实表明，建立以沟漫地为中心的基本农田制，是土石山区改变大自然的正确方向。第一，只有抛弃广种薄收，才能集中力量建设好基本农田，在基本农田上增施肥料，精耕细作，逐步实现园田化。第二，建立以沟漫地为中心的基本农田，把耕地从山坡上搬到山沟中，可以蓄水保墒，可以利用沟中的泉水和山上的洪水浇灌，迅速实现水利化。并可最大限度地利用坡上的腐草朽木，增加土地的肥力。由于沟地平坦，交通方便，容易耕作，便于实行运输车辆化，也便于将来实现耕作机械化。第三，把坡地停耕以后，大量植树造林，培植牧草，封山育林育草，结合沟中打坝漫地，就可以迅速有效地保持水土，并逐步发展林、牧、副业等多种经济。
    县委委员中尖锐的斗争
    建立基本农田制度的提出，是领导和实际相结合的结果。解放后，在党的领导下，经过大搞水土保持，努力发展生产，石楼县的贫困面貌已经发生了显著变化。但是，如何从根本上迅速改变低产贫困面貌的问题，还没有很好解决。大跃进以来，广大人民群众对于改变低产贫困面貌的要求极为迫切。就在这个时候，中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳和中共晋南地委第一书记赵雨亭等领导同志，视察了晋南山区的生产生活状况，并于今年1月，在隰宁县召开了西山七县第一书记会议，作出了山区建立基本农田的决定，制定了建立山区十年远景规划。这样一来，领导上的适时决策和广大群众的迫切要求结合了起来。
    但是，建立什么样的基本农田呢？采取什么速度和方法来建立基本农田呢？中共石楼县委常委会第一次讨论这个问题时，就有两种主张。县委书记刘宝玉和副书记李广义主张采取大破大立的革命措施，把黄土沟坡上的三十四万亩陡坡地全部停耕，还林还草；采取打坝漫沟地和建设现有沟川地的办法，建立新型的基本农田。县委宣传部长范天庆坚决反对这样作。他主张在现有的耕地中挑选一部分较好的坡地修成梯田，作为基本农田。他机械地认为坝沟漫地不符合“从上而下”治理的方针，断定停耕坡地是“冒险”；坝沟漫地是“劳民伤财，费力不讨好。”县长强拴玉则采取了模棱两可的自由主义态度，说：“坝沟漫地也能行，也不能行”。四个县委常委提出三种不同意见，一直争执不下，定不了案。于是决定由李广义和范天庆下去调查。李广义同志以十天时间和乡、社干部一起，在六个乡详细勘察了十二条有代表性的沟壑，走马观花地看了三十条沟壑，并且采用群众路线的方法，总结了义牒乡前进社在新义沟中停耕坡地、坝沟漫地的经验。新义沟三华里长，原来水土流失严重，沟壑上有陡坡地三百八十亩，亩产粮食仅仅三、四十斤。为了改变这种状况，他们从1955年在这条沟中打坝淤地，二年内淤漫沟地四十亩，总产粮食二万四千斤，平均亩产六百斤，等于原来三百八十亩坡地总产量的一倍半。在打坝淤地的同时，将三百八十亩陡地全部停耕，种植苜蓿和草木樨二百九十亩，植树九万八千株。现在，沟壑上的牧草已经两三尺高，小树也长起来了。三年来这条沟中没有流失水土。前两年，虽然沟壑上的草和树还没有长起来，但流失的水土全部漫了沟地；第三年，牧草和树苗都长起来了，做到了土不下山，水不出沟。新义沟的事实雄辩的说明：把坡地还林还草，建立以沟漫地为中心的基本农田，可以解决改变低产面貌和保持水土这两个重大问题。
    县委听取了李广义和范天庆的汇报。范天庆认为，根据他在罗村乡的调查，根本无沟可坝，除了在坡地上修梯田，再无其他出路。根据两个县委委员的汇报，县委认真地分析了全县的自然情况，认为新义沟的情况基本上可以代表全县。全县80％以上的面积是黄土梁峁沟壑区，沟长一般三、五里，最宜于漫沟地。据调查，能漫地五十亩左右的一里以上的黄土沟壑共一千三百余条，一里以下的还有近万条。如果大力打坝漫地，全县就可以漫出十万亩沟漫地。加上现有的四万亩沟川地，每人至少可以平均三亩好地。如果硬在陡坡地上修梯田，不仅费工多，短时期不能完成，就算修成梯田，也给车辆运输和将来的机械化耕作带来了很大困难。经过这样研究，十六个县委委员中有十一人主张建立“以沟漫地”为中心的基本农田。但范天庆还是坚决反对。全体县委便到城关乡的堡子沟边察看边讨论。这条沟同新义沟大体相同，经过在坡地上种草种树，在沟中打坝漫地，不仅保持了水土，而且漫成了一百亩沟地。事实又一次打击了保守派和怀疑派，十五个县委委员一致同意了建立以沟漫地为中心的基本农田的意见，只有范天庆一人仍然坚决反对。于是，县委坚决选择了建立以沟漫地为中心的基本农田的道路。
    那末，如何在最短的时间内把基本农田建设起来呢？县委算了一笔劳力账。按照义牒乡的经验，打坝漫一亩沟地用工八个，造一亩林或种一亩草需工半个，全县一万八千个劳力，抽出25％的劳力常年漫沟地和种草种树，一年就可以淤出十万亩沟地，种草种树二十至三十万亩。经过算账，县委的信心更大，决心更强。于是决定，在一年内打坝漫沟地八万亩，把停耕的坡地种上树木和牧草；在两年内使原有的四万亩沟川地水利化。为了保证当年粮食增产，县委决定采取随打坝、随切土垫沟、随播种、力争当年受益的方针。解除了人们耽心停耕过多、影响粮食总产量的忧虑。
    依靠群众　势如破竹
    彻底抛弃几千年来人们已经走惯了的广种薄收的耕作道路，建立以沟漫地为中心的基本农田制度，是农业生产上一次翻天覆地的大革命，必然会遇到各方面的思想抵触。因此，县委提出建立基本农田的方案后，即组织全县人民进行了大鸣大放大辩论。在辩论中，广大人民群众是热烈拥护县委方案的。但也有些人是反对的。他们认为县委是“说疯话”“吹牛皮”。“停耕土地是冒险，漫沟地是劳民伤财”。县委针对这些论点，向全县人民提出了：是广种薄收好呢？还是建立基本农田好？那条路多快好省？由于采取了就地“找钥匙”就地“开锁子”的算账对比办法，把全民大辩论很快就引向了高潮。经过半个月的全民大辩论，统一了思想，明确了方向，人人志气奋发，个个斗志昂扬，纷纷写决心书，到处开誓师大会。这样一来，县委的方案变成了群众的实际行动。在大辩论中，广大干部和群众还彻底揭发了县委宣传部长范天庆和义牒乡党委第二书记朱有海散布的许多右倾保守言论和他们十足的暮气和官气。在广大干部群众的一致要求下，县委撤掉了县委宣传部长、县委常委范天庆和义牒乡党委第二书记朱有海的职务。
    这样一个大变革，不仅会碰到许多思想障碍，也必然遇到许多实际困难。比如打坝的勘察设计、建筑材料的准备、劳动力的组织等等。县委紧紧抓住了广大人民群众迫切要求改变穷困状况的积极性，依靠群众，坚决采取苦干、实干的办法，使一切困难迎刃而解。
    为便于统一行动，县上建立了建设基本农田指挥部，由三个书记一个县长分别担任正、副总指挥。指挥部下设专业办公室。全县共抽出二百个干部，五千六百七十一个劳力（占总劳力32％），组成五个团、十七个营（每乡一营），下分若干连、排、班。团内并设有参谋、宣教、供应股和勘察、尖兵、突击三个专业队。以连队为单位，设立了炊事班，并且把卫生保健、商业供应和文化娱乐等力量，也都统统编进去，做到了领导一元化，生活集体化，食宿在工地，一片一片、一乡一乡地突击。在指挥部统帅下，除一个团在四万亩原有沟川地上进行水利建设外，其余四个团全力打坝漫地。
    战斗开始后，碰到的问题是：第一、用什么材料打坝，打什么样的坝。有的人主张，应该用洋灰等高级材料打洋坝；但更多的人主张就地取材，马上动手，有土就打土坝，有石头就筑石坝。指挥部坚决支持了后一种主张。第二、选择什么地形打坝，谁来设计？在这方面，许多人没有经验，县上也找不到这种技术人材。怎么办呢？县委立即在各连队中普遍召开了“诸葛亮会”、“能人会”、“群英会”，举办了“献计台”、“赛计台”（比计多，计好，计高），找到了大批行之有效的土办法。指挥部立即把献计运动中涌现出来的二百名土专家和水保站的技术干部抽调出来，组成四个专业勘察队，由县委书记刘宝玉、副书记古仰光、李广义和县长李志勇亲自率领，先行出发，边勘察，边设计，边插牌（牌上写明坝的高度、厚度、宽度、用工数等规格质量标准），边施工。并且由勘察队负责，竣工一坝，验收一坝，不合标准者立即返工。做到了坝坝合乎标准。为了提高劳动效率，保证工程质量，开展了以总路线为纲的政治思想工作。各个工地普遍采取了“比将台”、“英雄榜”、“群英会”、“庆功会”、“夺红旗”等竞赛方式，开展了全县范围的前方与后方、团与团、营与营、连与连、排与排、班与班、人与人、不同工种、不同行业之间的劳动大竞赛，通过定期的和随时随地的检查评比，表扬了大批的先进单位和英雄人物，调动了一切积极因素，激励了群众的革命干劲。
    经过半年苦战，全县打坝四千二百一十条，做土石方二百万立方公尺，完成了九万八千亩坝沟地工程，对原有的四万亩沟川地进行了平整土地，兴修水利一万三千亩。通过坝沟漫地，今年拦积了泥沙两千万立方公尺，等于全县每年向黄河流失泥沙总量的43％，不仅保证了农业大丰收，而且有效的控制了水土流失。通过半年的实践，广大干部和群众摸到了一套打坝漫地技术经验。这就是：（1）选择肚大口小，土质坚固，取土容易的沟口筑坝。（2）由沟后至沟前，分节打坝，分块漫地，而后再逐渐建成大片沟地。（3）沟深内外有坡度，打坝时把根基打实。（4）溢洪道要坚固，较宽的沟要两边留溢洪道。（5）把洪水头先引到沟旁墙壁上，不要使水头直冲坝身。（6）地漫成后，即在沟中搞蓄水库，挖泉水，修水渠，逐步使沟地园田化。同时，半年的实践，大大锻炼了石楼人民，使人们认识了大自然是能够征服的。事实表明：当人民群众找到了奔向幸福道路的时候，任何困难就都提不到话下，一切奇迹都会创造出来。一切条件论、守旧派、改良主义者在此情况下，只能一输再输。
    明年每人只种二亩地
    石楼县今年的空前大丰收，仅仅是一个良好的开始。县委已经向全县人民提出：1959年每人只种二亩基本农田，种一亩小麦，半亩秋粮，半亩经济作物。每亩产量小麦双千斤，秋粮四千斤，籽棉一千斤，油料一千斤，蔬菜一万斤。为了实现这个指标，将在今冬明春使块块基本农田水利化，力争实现园田化。现在四万石楼人民，正在为把四万亩休闲秋田深翻三尺，每亩施底肥二十万斤而奋斗。
