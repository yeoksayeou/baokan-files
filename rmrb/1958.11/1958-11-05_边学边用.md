Learning is for application, and only through application can one learn better. The report on the Zhejiang Medical College's senior students running a worker's hospital in a steel factory illustrates this truth with facts.

It should be added here that the senior students of Zhejiang Medical College are "using" their skills at the right time and in the right place. Currently, everyone on the steel front is experiencing a tense battle, and many people are working so hard to produce more steel for the country that they are forgetting to eat and sleep. The more selflessly the people on the steel front work, the more their health should be cared for. It was at this time that the senior students of Zhejiang Medical College established a worker's hospital in the steel factory. Through their efforts, more than 10,000 cases of illness at the Banshan Steel Factory have been treated. One can imagine how much this single force will contribute to steel production.

What Zhejiang Medical College can do, other medical colleges should also be able to do. Learning while working not only supports current production, but more importantly, it will cultivate both red and expert medical cadres through work.

### 边学边用

    边学边用
    学是为了用，只有经过用，才会学得更好。浙江医学院高年级学生在钢铁厂办工人医院的报道，用事实说明了这个道理。
    这里要补充说明的是：浙江医学院高年级学生“用”得正是时候，“用”得正是地方。现在，一切站在钢铁战线的人都在经历着一场紧张的战斗，许许多多的人为了给国家生产更多的钢，真是到了废寝忘食的程度。钢铁战线上的人们越是这样地忘我劳动，就越是应当关怀他们的健康。正是在这样的时候，浙江医学院高年级学生在钢铁厂办起了工人医院。经过他们的努力，半山钢铁厂一万多人次的疾病都治疗好了。可以想像，单是这一支力量将会在钢铁生产上发挥多么大的作用。
    浙江医学院可以做到的，其他医学院也应当做到。一边学习，一边工作，这不仅支援了当前的生产，更重要的是通过工作将会培养出又红又专的医务干部。
