Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 22nd: "Rodong Sinmun" today published an editorial entitled "Great Friendship Forged in Blood" on the occasion of the visit of the Korean government delegation to China and the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement.

The editorial said that all the Korean people are heartily delighted and encouraged by the visit of the government delegation of the Republic to China. This visit will make a significant contribution to strengthening the traditional friendship and friendly solidarity between the people of Korea and China, to strengthening the economic and cultural cooperative relations between the two peoples who are leaping forward in socialist construction, and to consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

The editorial said: "According to the Korean-Chinese Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed five years ago, Korea and China have carried out close economic cooperation and continuous cultural exchanges, which have played a huge role in promoting the ever-developing socialist construction of the two countries."

The editorial said that the Korean people are paying close attention to the achievements made by the Chinese people in the great leap forward of socialist construction and are happy about it as if it were their own achievement. Today, under the wise leadership of the Workers' Party, the Korean people have set off a huge upsurge in all sectors of socialist construction. The editorial said that this visit of the Korean government delegation to China will strengthen the economic and cultural cooperative relations and exchanges of experience between the two peoples, which will be of great significance to further promoting the revolutionary upsurge.

The editorial said: The Chinese people have always given active support and solidarity to the Korean people's resolute struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The Korean people resolutely condemn the new provocative acts of US imperialism against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan Strait area, and the Korean people warn the US aggressors that any act of aggression against the Chinese people is a threat to Korea.

"Minju Choson" published an editorial today congratulating the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement. The editorial said that the Korean people, in welcoming the fifth anniversary of the signing of this agreement, are determined to further strengthen the unbreakable friendship and unity between the two peoples.

The editorial said that with the rapid development of socialist construction in Korea and China, the economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries has been further strengthened. In 1958, the trade volume between the two countries will increase by 50% compared with last year and ten times compared with 1954. The long-term trade agreement for 1959-1962 and the two loan agreements signed between Korea and China in Beijing in September this year will further strengthen and develop the economic cooperation between the two countries.

The editorial said that the cultural cooperation between the two countries is also developing rapidly. In particular, the recent establishment of the Korea-China Friendship Association and the China-Korea Friendship Association in the two countries has further enlivened the cultural exchanges between the two countries.

The editorial expressed its conviction that the visit of the Korean government delegation to China will contribute to further strengthening the friendly cooperation between the two peoples and promoting the victory of the common cause.
