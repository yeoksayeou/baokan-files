Xinhua News Agency, London, October 30th. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd today frankly admitted in the House of Commons that Britain is an apologist for the U.S.'s aggressive policy towards China and an accomplice in the U.S.'s plot to create "Two Chinas."

In his speech on foreign policy, Lloyd openly raised the "Two Chinas" argument, and absurdly distorted China's civil war into an international dispute between "Two Chinas" or between the Sino-Soviet side and the U.S.-Chiang side, repeating the U.S.'s so-called "no use of force" platitude. He said: "Some people believe that the dispute between the two Chinas is a civil war. However, one side has formed a close alliance with the Soviet Union, while the other side has a defense treaty with the United States. These are facts, and therefore any idea of resolving this issue by force is extremely dangerous."

In his speech, Lloyd slandered China's firm stance in resolutely safeguarding territorial sovereignty and opposing U.S. interference, and shamelessly defended the U.S.'s naked aggression against China. He said: "The Beijing government has adopted a completely inflexible attitude. They continue to use force. As far as the U.S. government is concerned, I absolutely believe that they want to deal with this issue peacefully."

Lloyd also supported the U.S. aggressors' "no concession" stance, saying, "The House should carefully consider what the consequences would be in some small countries in Southeast Asia and the Far East if the United States were to concede on the use of force on the issue of Formosa and the coastal islands. One ultimate consequence may be the withdrawal of the United States from the huge responsibilities it has already undertaken in the Far East, and I think only a handful of people truly believe that the withdrawal of the United States would be beneficial to world peace."

Lloyd advocated "trying to create an atmosphere" on this issue so that a so-called "temporary agreement" could be reached.

Referring to Britain's intervention in Jordan, Lloyd shamelessly defended it, saying that Britain's intervention "is a contribution to the peace and stability of the region that no one can deny."

Labor Party foreign policy spokesman Bevan said that Taiwan was seized from China by the Japanese in the nineteenth century. "It is absurd to say that China is being unreasonable."

However, Bevan also advocated "freezing the Taiwan issue for the time being," and said: It is unwise for China "to forcibly resolve the status of Taiwan now. But we do think that these coastal islands are a completely different category of problem."

Bevan accused Britain of voting in the United Nations to postpone consideration of the issue of admitting China for another year. He said: "This is not a conciliatory approach, and I can say with great certainty that it does not conform to the wishes of the British people. I believe that the vast majority of people would like to see Britain speak more clearly and independently to the United States on this issue and other issues." He said: "International relations are being poisoned. How can we exclude six hundred and fifty million people from the international family, how can we hope to seek peace when we adopt that approach?"

### 劳埃德又为杜勒斯帮腔  公然表示英国要参加制造“两个中国”阴谋

    劳埃德又为杜勒斯帮腔
    公然表示英国要参加制造“两个中国”阴谋
    新华社伦敦30日电　英国外交大臣劳埃德今天在下议院率直地供认，英国是美国对华侵略政策的辩护士和美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋的同谋犯。
    劳埃德在关于外交问题的发言中公然提出了“两个中国”的论点，并且荒谬地把中国的内战歪曲为
  “两个中国”之间或者中苏一方同美蒋一方之间的国际争端，重复美国所谓“不使用武力”的滥调。他说：“有些人认为两个中国之间的争执是内战。但是，一方同苏联结成了紧密的同盟，而另一方则同美国缔有防御条约。这都是事实，因而用武力来解决这个问题的任何想法都是极端危险的。”
    劳埃德在发言中对中国坚决维护领土主权和反对美国干涉的坚定立场进行了污蔑，并且无耻地为美国对中国的赤裸裸地侵略进行了辩护。他说：“北京政府方面采取了完全不灵活的态度。他们继续使用武力。就美国政府而言，我绝对相信，他们是要和平地处理这个问题的。”
    劳埃德还支持美国侵略者“不让步”的主张，他说，“下院应该慎重考虑，如果美国对于在福摩萨和沿海岛屿问题上使用武力这一点让步，在东南亚和远东的一些小国中将会产生什么样的后果。一个最终的后果可能是美国退出它在远东已经承担的巨大责任，而我认为，只有一小撮人才真正认为美国的退出会是有利于世界和平的。”
    劳埃德主张在这个问题上“设法产生一种气氛”，以便可以取得所谓“某种临时协议”。
    在谈到英国对约旦的干涉时，劳埃德厚颜地辩护说，英国的干涉“是任何人都否认不了的一种对该地区和平稳定的贡献”。
    工党外交政策发言人比万说，台湾是日本人在十九世纪从中国抢走的。“要说中国不讲道理那是荒谬的。”
    但是，比万又主张“在目前冻结台湾问题”，并且说：中国“要在现在强行解决台湾的地位问题，是不智的。但是我们的确认为，这些沿海岛屿是属于完全不同范畴的问题。”
    比万指责英国在联合国投票同意把考虑接纳中国的问题再推迟一年。他说：“这不是调解的作法，我可以十分肯定地说，这是不符合英国人民的愿望的。我相信，绝大多数人民愿意看到英国在这个问题上以及其他问题上能够向美国说得更清楚一些，态度更独立一些。”他说：“国际关系正在遭到毒害。我们怎么能把六亿五千万人民排斥在国际大家庭之外呢，我们怎么能够希望在采取那种作法的时候求得和平呢？”
