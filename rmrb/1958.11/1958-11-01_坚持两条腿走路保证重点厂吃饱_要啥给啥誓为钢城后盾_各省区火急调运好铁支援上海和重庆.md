Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 31st - Shanghai, one of the nation's key steel production bases, is receiving strong support from various regions in steelmaking production. Thanks to the strengthened supply work, the average daily amount of pig iron arriving in Shanghai has now reached approximately 5,000 tons. Various regions have demonstrated a communist spirit of selflessness in supporting Shanghai's work. Shandong Province proposed prioritizing supplies outside the province over supplies within the province in its pig iron supply arrangements, willing to reduce its own steel production to transfer high-quality iron to Shanghai. Fujian Province adjusted the pig iron supply in some areas within the province, also prioritizing support for Shanghai. Many regions, despite feeling a shortage of labor, still mobilized a large number of people to rush the transfer of pig iron scattered in various smelting points to transportation trunk lines, so as to transfer them to Shanghai's steel mills in a timely manner. In the fourth quarter, provinces in the East China region, as well as Henan, Guangxi, Hunan and other provinces and autonomous regions, will supply Shanghai with more than one million tons of pig iron. Coke, coal, and auxiliary materials needed by the steel industry are also being shipped from various regions to Shanghai. Shandong Province, which is responsible for supplying nearly half of Shanghai's current coke needs, has recently transferred a batch of washed coke to Shanghai, with large pieces, hard texture, and low ash content. Changxing and Wuxing counties in Zhejiang Province and Nanjing City in Jiangsu Province have also decided to increase the supply of limestone, lime, and dolomite to Shanghai by more than 60,000 tons this year.
    The people of Shanghai are determined to respond to the enthusiastic support from various regions by producing more steel and producing steel faster. On October 27th, they created a new record of producing 8,014.7 tons of steel in one day.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 31st - The people of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, who have achieved significant results in iron smelting, are adopting the method of "people, horses, cattle, carts, and boats, ants moving Mount Tai," and are vigorously gathering pig iron to support Shanghai's steelmaking.

    Currently, Nanning region has organized a steel transportation army of more than 79,000 people, and mobilized 138 automobiles and a large number of bullock carts and horse carts to participate in transportation. More than 310,000 people in the Liuzhou region have also been put into the work of handling pig iron. The Liuzhou region alone had transported 295,500 tons of pig iron and other materials by the 20th.

    The people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi believe that being able to use their own produced pig iron to support Shanghai's steelmaking is a glorious task that they should fulfill in completing the nation's 10.7 million tons of steel. Therefore, in the current situation of busy industrial and agricultural production, extremely tight labor force, and inconvenient transportation in mountainous areas, various regions have adopted various methods to overcome difficulties and resolutely complete the task. In order to transport iron well to support Shanghai, in addition to immediately transporting the high-quality iron scattered in the mountainous areas to the transportation lines for shipment, some inferior iron and sintered iron were re-smelted into high-quality iron and transported to Shanghai.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 31st - The steelmaking pig iron that Jiangxi Province is supporting Shanghai with is all gray iron and white iron with high purity, few impurities, and an iron content of over 90%. The good quality of the pig iron has been praised by relevant parties in Shanghai.

    In the process of transferring pig iron to support Shanghai's steelmaking, the people of Jiangxi demonstrated a communist spirit of selflessness. They proposed that high-quality iron must be used to support Shanghai, and inferior iron should be left for re-smelting or used by themselves. In order to ensure the quality of the pig iron transferred out, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee had repeatedly instructed party committees at all levels to conduct strict inspections of the pig iron transferred out, and resolutely eliminate those that did not meet the standards. In addition to conducting quality inspections of the pig iron transferred out, they also emphasized the importance of iron quality in daily production. The Provincial Party Committee once stipulated that all pig iron, sponge iron, or sintered iron with an iron content of less than 90% must be re-smelted.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 31st - Zhejiang Province rushed to mobilize 1,000 tons of pig iron on the 31st and transported it to Shanghai to support various steel mills in steelmaking. To date, the province has transported 25,530 tons of pig iron to Shanghai. All stations and docks in the province have put the task of transporting pig iron to Shanghai in the first place. The workers are transporting day and night, shipping it as soon as it arrives, determined to complete the task of supporting Shanghai with pig iron.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 31st - From August to October 28th, various regions in Jiangsu Province transferred 33,533 tons of pig iron to Shanghai, accounting for one-third of the province's pig iron production.

    Although Jiangsu Province itself currently urgently needs a large amount of pig iron to make steel and manufacture various mechanical equipment, and at the same time, pig iron production has been limited recently due to insufficient coal supply, party committees at all levels are still trying their best to overcome difficulties to ensure the completion of the task of supporting Shanghai. In early October, the Changzhou Municipal Party Committee received instructions requiring it to support Shanghai with 270 tons of pig iron within three days. The Municipal Party Committee immediately reduced the city's iron consumption for castings by half in order to first meet Shanghai's steelmaking needs. In order to ensure the quality of pig iron, some responsible persons in the city also personally inspected the iron at the railway station, rejecting the pig iron with poorer quality.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 31st - Many places inside and outside Sichuan Province are urgently transferring pig iron to support the steel city of Chongqing in steelmaking. Chongqing's steel production in the first 26 days of October increased by 70% compared to September, and the highest daily output has exceeded 10,000 tons. The continuous increase in steel production requires a greater supply of pig iron. Now, Benxi in the distant Northeast, Xuanhua in Hebei, as well as Hubei, Guizhou, and other places, are all rushing to transport large quantities of pig iron to support Chongqing. By the 26th, the pig iron that various places outside Sichuan Province had supported Chongqing with had reached 80% of the planned transportation volume; the rest is also being rushed.

    The native iron produced by the native blast furnaces in various special districts within Sichuan Province has become the main source of iron for steelmaking in Chongqing. Many special districts are working hard to strengthen the transfer and transport of the best quality pig iron in their districts to support Chongqing as soon as possible. In order to improve transportation conditions in the mining areas, many special districts have concentrated their efforts, repairing short-distance steel gathering and transportation lines from steep mountainous areas to transportation ports day and night. The Daxian Special District, where transportation is very inconvenient, organized a road-building army of 200,000 people, rushing to repair more than 300 kilometers of highways, more than 15,000 kilometers of large and small roadways and animal transport roads, 7,000 meters of cableways, manufactured more than 30,000 various vehicles, and also opened up more than 100 kilometers of waterways, which greatly facilitated short-distance collection and transportation from mountainous areas to transportation ports. In the past month or so, the entire district has transported more than 10,000 tons of pig iron to support Chongqing. (Attached picture)

    坚持两条腿走路保证重点厂吃饱
    要啥给啥誓为钢城后盾
    各省区火急调运好铁支援上海和重庆
    据新华社上海31日电　全国重点钢铁生产基地之一的上海，在炼钢生产方面正在得到各地的大力支援。由于供应工作的加强，目前运到上海的生铁平均每天已达五千吨左右。各地在支援上海的工作中表现了舍己为人的共产主义风格。山东省在生铁供应的安排上提出先省外，后省内，宁可自己少炼钢，也要把好铁调给上海。福建省调整了省内某些地区的生铁供应，也优先支援上海。许多地区虽然感到劳动力不足，还是抽调大批人力把分散在各冶炼点的生铁突击抢运到运输干线上，以便及时转运给上海的炼钢厂。第四季度里，华东地区各省以及河南、广西、湖南等省、自治区，将供应上海一百多万吨生铁。钢铁工业需要的焦炭、煤和辅助材料也从各地源源运来上海。担负供应上海目前焦炭需要量近一半的山东省，连日来调给上海一批洗焦，块子大、质地坚硬、灰分少。浙江省长兴、吴兴县和江苏省南京市，也决定年内增加供应上海石灰石、石灰和白云石六万多吨。
    上海人民决心以多炼钢、快炼钢来回答各地的热情支援。10月27日，他们创造了一天产钢八千零十四点七吨的新纪录。
    据新华社南宁31日电　在炼铁方面取得了重大成绩的广西僮族自治区各族人民，采取“人马牛车船、蚂蚁搬泰山”的办法，正在大力调集生铁支援上海炼钢。
    目前，南宁地区已经组织了七万九千多人的钢铁运输大军，并且调集了一百三十八部汽车和大批牛车马车参加运输。柳州地区投入搬运生铁的也有三十一万多人。仅柳州地区，到20日就已运出生铁等物资二十九万五千五百多吨。
    广西各族人民认为能用自己生产的生铁支援上海炼钢，是他们在完成国家一千零七十万吨钢方面应尽的光荣任务。因此，在当前工农业生产繁忙、劳动力十分紧张，山区交通不便的情况下，各地都采取各种办法克服困难，坚决完成任务。各族人民为了运好铁支援上海，除了立即把分散在山区的好铁搬运到交通沿线待运外，并把一些次铁和烧结铁重新炼成好铁运往上海。
    新华社南昌31日电　江西省支援上海的炼钢生铁，全部都是纯度高、杂质少、含铁量在90％以上的灰口铁和白口铁。由于生铁质量好，已经得到上海市有关方面的好评。
    在调运生铁支援上海炼钢的过程中，江西人民表现了舍己为人的共产主义风格。他们提出，一定要把好铁支援上海，坏铁留下回炉重炼或自己用。为了保证外调生铁的质量，中共江西省委曾数次指示各级党委对外调生铁进行严格的检查，发现不合规格的坚决剔除。除了对外调生铁进行质量检查，在平日生产中他们也强调要重视铁的质量。省委曾经规定，凡含铁量在90％以下的生铁、海绵铁或烧结铁，必须回炉重炼。
    据新华社杭州31日电　浙江省在31日突击调集一千吨生铁，运往上海支援各炼钢厂炼钢。全省到目前止，已经运到上海的生铁有二万五千五百三十吨。全省各个车站、码头都把运往上海生铁的任务放在第一位，工人们日夜运输，随到随运，决心完成支援上海生铁的任务。
    新华社南京31日电　江苏省各地从8月到10月28日调运上海的生铁有三万三千五百三十三吨，占全省生铁产量的三分之一。
    虽然江苏省本省目前也急需大量生铁炼钢和制造各种机械设备，同时由于煤炭供应不足，最近生铁产量也受到限制，但是各级党委仍然千方百计克服困难，保证完成支援上海的任务。10月初，中共常州市委接到指示，要求三天内支援上海二百七十吨生铁，市委当即将本市铸件用铁量减少一半，以便首先满足上海炼钢需要。为了保证生铁质量，市里的一些负责人还亲自在火车站验收，将质量较差的生铁剔出。
    据新华社重庆31日电　四川省内外许多地方正在紧急调运生铁，支援钢城重庆炼钢。重庆市10月份前二十六天的钢产量，比9月份增长了70％，最高日产量已超过一万吨。钢产量的不断增长，要求更多地供应生铁。现在，远从东北的本溪、河北的宣化，以及湖北、贵州等地，都正赶运大批生铁支援重庆。到26日止，四川省外各地支援重庆的生铁，已达到计划运量的80％；其余的也正在赶运中。
    四川省内各专区土高炉出产的土铁，已成为重庆市炼钢用铁的主要来源。许多专区都在努力加强调运，把本区质量最好的生铁，尽快调出支援重庆。为了改善矿区的运输条件，许多专区都集中力量，日夜抢修从险峻山区到交通口道的短途钢铁集运线。交通很不方便的达县专区，组织了二十万人的筑路大军，在山区抢修了公路三百多公里，大小车道和驮运道路一万五千多公里，索道七千多公尺，制造了各种车辆三万多部，还开辟了航道一百多公里，大大便利了山区到交通口道的短途集运。全区在最近一个多月内，已运出一万多吨生铁支援重庆。（附图片）
