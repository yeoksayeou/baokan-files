Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 17th - Arab United Republic President Nasser, when meeting with a reporter from the Lebanese newspaper "Al-Sahafa," refuted the slanderous rumor spread by imperialists that the Soviet Union was attempting to rule the United Arab Republic by providing it with large amounts of loans.

“Al-Sahafa” and the “Al-Gomhouria” newspaper here published President Nasser's remarks on the 15th and 17th respectively.

Nasser said that answering the imperialists' rumors is very simple. Repayment of Soviet loans will only begin after the relevant factories start production and will be repaid in installments over twelve years, with an interest rate of 2.5%. This means that the installments will be paid with the products of the factories.

President Nasser also said that the United Arab Republic will only repay the Soviet loans provided for the Aswan High Dam project after the first phase of the Aswan High Dam is completed. During this period, the United Arab Republic can reclaim 1.7 million feddans of land.

President Nasser pointed out that the United States withdrew its proposal to fund the High Dam project in an insulting manner in 1956, so Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company and used the canal's income to fund the construction of the High Dam. He also recounted the imperialist military aggression and economic pressure, including the freezing of Egyptian funds abroad.

Nasser also refuted the rumors spread by imperialists about inflation in the United Arab Republic. He said that all loans obtained by the United Arab Republic are used for industrialization plans. He said that as long as production increases, inflation is impossible. He also said that the expenditure on production and services in the past six years has not caused any inflation.

Speaking of economic plans, Nasser said that the first goal of the United Arab Republic is to meet the needs of the country without delaying economic development and industrialization plans. He said that the United Arab Republic's five-year plan will be completed in three years, and at the same time, it can undertake the task of completing the Aswan High Dam project.

Speaking of Israel's attempted aggression against Jordan, Nasser said that any aggression against Jordan means that the United Arab Republic will fulfill its obligations to Jordan under the Arab Collective Security Treaty. This treaty stipulates that aggression against Jordan is aggression against the United Arab Republic.

President Nasser also stated that the United Arab Republic will spare no effort to strengthen relations between the United Arab Republic and Lebanon. He expressed his firm belief that restoring normal relations between the two countries will help strengthen economic relations.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 18th - A commentary broadcast by the Arab United Republic Radio on the evening of the 17th reiterated the United Arab Republic's policy of neutrality, praised the Soviet Union's unselfish assistance, and criticized the aggression of American and British imperialism.

The commentary talked about the difficulties created by Western countries for the United Arab Republic's pursuit of President Nasser's policy of peaceful neutrality. The commentary cited the Aswan High Dam as an example, illustrating that the United States attempted to force the United Arab Republic to submit to the United States by providing loans with many political conditions attached. The commentary said, "If these conditions are accepted, the United Arab Republic will be forced to abandon its independent policy and subserviently pursue Washington's policy. And Washington's policy is to disrupt and undermine the friendly unity between Arab countries in order to achieve its ulterior motives."

The commentary continued, "Contrary to Western countries, the Soviet Union selflessly and quickly provided us with funds without any political or economic conditions attached. The only condition is that we need to repay the loan after a few years. In fact, the Soviet Union has friendly helped us build a project that can improve the living standards of our people. In this case, we are obviously happy to accept the Soviet Union's friendly help. The Soviet Union has long sympathized with the great struggle of various Arab countries for national independence."

The commentary condemned the vicious attacks launched by Western newspapers against President Nasser on this matter. It said, "Our position on the development of the situation is determined by the other party's attitude towards us. We cannot deny that the Western camp has always been trying to harm the interests of the Arab people. It has even launched military aggression against us and taken a series of economic measures. Western countries, especially the United States and Britain, have repeatedly and publicly expressed hostility towards us.

"On the contrary, the countries of the Eastern camp have always held a fair and sympathetic attitude towards us. These countries have established diplomatic and economic relations with us, but they have not attempted to endanger our security or interfere in our foreign and domestic policies. In addition, on the international stage, the countries of the Eastern camp often support the positions of Arab countries." The commentary emphasized, "Of course, we cannot and will not pursue a policy of discriminating against the countries of the Eastern camp. It is quite natural for us to maintain normal relations with these countries."

The radio station finally pointed out that President Nasser leads the entire United Arab Republic to resolutely pursue a policy of neutrality. It said, "This policy is beneficial to the whole world and beneficial to peace."

    不许诬蔑苏联对阿联的无私援助
    纳赛尔痛斥帝国主义者无耻造谣
    阿联电台赞扬社会主义国家对阿拉伯人民的友谊
    新华社开罗17日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔在接见黎巴嫩“萨哈法报”记者时驳斥了帝国主义者散播的所谓苏联企图通过向阿联大量提供贷款的方法来对它进行统治的这个诬蔑性的谣言。
    “萨哈法报”和这里的“共和国报”分别在15日和17日发表了纳赛尔总统的谈话。
    纳赛尔说，要回答帝国主义者的谣言是很简单的。在各有关工厂开始投入生产以后，才开始偿还苏联的贷款，并且将在十二年中分期偿付，利息是2.5％。这意味着分期偿付的款项将用各工厂的产品来支付。
    纳赛尔总统又说，阿联将在阿斯旺高水坝的第一期工程完工以后，才偿还苏联对高水坝工程所提供的贷款。在这段时间里，阿联可以开垦一百七十万费丹的土地。
    纳赛尔总统指出，美国在1956年用污辱性的方式撤回它资助高水坝计划的建议，因此埃及才把苏伊士运河公司收归国有，用运河的收入作为修建高水坝的资金。他还追述了帝国主义的军事侵略和经济压力，其中包括冻结埃及在国外的资金。
    纳赛尔还驳斥了帝国主义散播的所谓阿联发生通货膨胀的谣言。他说，阿联得到的所有贷款都用于工业化计划。他说，只要生产增长，就不可能发生通货膨胀。他又说，过去六年中用在生产和服务方面的开支并没有造成任何通货膨胀。
    在谈到经济计划时，纳赛尔说，阿联的第一个目的就是在不推迟经济发展和工业化计划的情况下满足国家的需要。他说，阿联的五年计划将在三年内完成，同时它能够担负起完成阿斯旺高水坝计划的任务。
    在谈到以色列对约旦的侵略企图时，纳赛尔说，对约旦的任何侵略意味着阿联将根据阿拉伯集体安全条约来履行它对约旦所承担的义务。这个条约规定，对于约旦的侵略就是对阿联的侵略。
    纳赛尔总统还表示，阿联将不遗余力地加强阿联同黎巴嫩两国间的关系。他表示深信，恢复两国之间的正常关系有助于加强经济关系。
    新华社开罗18日电　阿拉伯联合共和国电台在17日晚间广播的一篇评论中重申阿联奉行中立政策，赞扬苏联的无私援助和抨击美英帝国主义的侵略。
    评论谈到西方国家对阿联奉行纳赛尔总统的和平中立政策所制造的困难。评论举阿斯旺高水坝为例，说明美国企图通过提供附加着许多政治条件的贷款来迫使阿联屈从美国。评论说，“如果接受这些条件，阿联就会被迫放弃独立的政策而屈从地奉行华盛顿的政策。而华盛顿的政策是要扰乱和破坏阿拉伯各国之间的友好团结，以便达到其不可告人的目的。”
    评论接着说，“同西方国家相反，苏联却无私地迅速向我们提供了资金，并且不附带任何政治或经济条件，唯一条件是我们需要在几年之后偿还这笔贷款。事实上，苏联友好地帮助我们修建一项能够提高我国人民生活水平的工程。在这种情况下，我们显然乐于接受苏联的友好帮助。苏联长期以来就同情各个阿拉伯国家争取民族独立的伟大斗争。”
    评论谴责西方报刊就这件事向纳赛尔总统发动的恶毒攻击。它说，“我们对事态发展的立场，是由对方对我们的态度所决定的。我们无法否认，西方阵营始终在设法损害阿拉伯人民的利益，它甚至对我们发动了军事侵略和采取了一系列的经济措施。西方国家，特别是美国和英国，曾经多次公开对我们表示敌意。
    “相反地，东方阵营的国家始终对我们抱着公正和同情的态度。这些国家同我们建立了外交上和经济上的关系，但是他们没有企图危害我们的安全和干涉我们的对外和对内政策。另外在国际舞台上，东方阵营的国家往往支持阿拉伯各国的立场。”评论强调说，“我们当然不能，也不会奉行歧视东方阵营国家的政策。我们同这些国家维持正常关系是十分自然的。”
    这家电台最后指出，纳赛尔总统领导阿联全国坚决奉行中立政策。它说，“这种政策对全世界有利、对和平有利”。
