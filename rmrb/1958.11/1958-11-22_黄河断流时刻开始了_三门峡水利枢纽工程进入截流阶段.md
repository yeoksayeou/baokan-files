Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, November 21st (Reporter Jun Qian): The world-renowned Yellow River Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project, after nearly nineteen months of struggle by the builders, officially began the diversion project of the Shenmen River on the 20th. Thus, this great water conservancy construction project has entered the second phase of construction, that is, it has entered the critical and most intense battle phase.

The Sanmenxia construction site, which had been raining continuously for more than half a month, was clear yesterday. More than ten thousand employees were all in high spirits. The entire construction site was like a battlefield and filled with a festive atmosphere. This year, the Yellow River is a year of abundant water. The flow since entering November has reached a maximum of 2,430 cubic meters per second, which is also the largest abundant water month for the same period in the past fifty years. However, the builders, with their fearless spirit, still ignored the difficulties and launched a fierce battle to seize the river channel from the flood to accelerate the construction of this project. One after another, new heavy-duty trucks transported stones from the Shijiatan and Sanmengou material yards. Approximately one truckload of stones was poured into the Shenmen River every minute, and the river water was splashed with high waves. This continuous rush to throw stones and build the diversion cofferdam will gradually narrow the river channel and eventually block it.

After more than a year of transformation by the builders, the appearance of Sanmenxia has undergone tremendous changes. The Kaiyuan New River and the Shuzhuangtai on the left bank have long disappeared. Only a section of the tail of Renmen Island remains. Only a piece of rock from the alchemy furnace remains on Zhanggong Island. In this area, there are twelve comb-shaped holes made of reinforced concrete for water discharge, which can pass a flow of 1,500 cubic meters per second. On the right side of the comb teeth, along the direction of the original Renmen Island and Zhanggong Island, stands a longitudinal reinforced concrete diversion wall, isolation pier, and water barrier wall that is 260 meters long and 27 meters high at its highest point. This is the boundary between the future spillway and the hydroelectric power station. Shenmen Island and Guimen Island, which have been blasted away by half, have been split in half again, with a large gap in the middle, serving as a water discharge route during the diversion. A wide highway bridge lies across the Guimen River, and equipment and stone materials for the Shenmen River diversion are transported over it. Underneath this highway bridge, three giant steel gates have been installed, preparing for the final diversion of the entire project. Of all the original rock islands, only the Dizhushi, which has symbolized China's national style for thousands of years, remains intact and stands majestically in the waves. Downstream of the Dizhushi, there is a steel bridge connecting the two banks, serving as the artery for transporting dam construction materials to the left bank. On the right bank, there are three modern transportation lines connecting the Longhai Railway: one highway each on the mountain and at the foot of the mountain; and one railway on the mountain. Factories, offices, and employee housing are scattered all over the mountains and at the foot of the mountains on both sides. At night, the electric lights are brilliant, illuminating the area as if it were daytime.

The heroes who transformed the Yellow River forced the water of the Kaiyuan New River and the Renmen River to flow through the Shenmen River and the Guimen River last year, and completed the first phase of the cofferdam project in June this year. After the second phase of the cofferdam, namely the Shenmen River and Guimen River cofferdam project, was prepared, the Yellow River water was forced to flow through the Renmen River again from 12:00 on the 16th of this month, lowering the water level of the Shenmen River by more than one foot. However, this is no longer the original Renmen River, and the river water now flows downstream through the newly built twelve comb-shaped bottom holes. This is the first time the Yellow River has been tamed to flow downstream according to people's will. This is a victory for more than a year of hard work.

This second phase of the cofferdam project will first block the Shenmen River and then the Guimen River. The method of diversion is to use China's method of blocking the mouth of the river, building a dike by throwing stones from the right bank, gradually advancing, gradually narrowing the river channel, and finally closing the gap to completely block the river channel. The diversion project of the Shenmen River began with a rehearsal at 9:00 on the 17th. Because the rehearsal went smoothly, it continued non-stop. In the future, as the cofferdam extends further forward, the river channel will become narrower and narrower, the river water flow rate will become higher and higher, the difference in water level between the upstream and downstream of the cofferdam will become larger and larger, the scouring force of the river water will become more and more fierce, the advance will become more and more difficult, and the combat effectiveness of the construction will become stronger and stronger. Diverting water in such a large flow and such a large river water level difference has not only never been done in China, but is also extremely rare in the world. The builders, with their infinite wisdom and power to transform nature, are confidently and heroically launching an attack on the raging torrent on the basis of three days of rehearsals.

### 黄河断流时刻开始了  三门峡水利枢纽工程进入截流阶段

    黄河断流时刻开始了
    三门峡水利枢纽工程进入截流阶段
    新华社三门峡21日电　记者君谦报道：举世瞩目的黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程，经过建设者们近十九个月的奋斗，在20日正式开始了神门河截流工程。至此，这项伟大的水利建设工程就进入了第二期施工，也即进入了关键性的最紧张的战斗阶段。
    阴雨连绵达半个多月的三门峡工地，昨天天气晴明。万余职工个个精神抖擞。整个工地既像战场，又充满了节日的气氛。今年黄河是个丰水年，进入11月以来的流量，最大曾到二千四百三十秒公方，又是五十年来同期最大的丰水月。但是具有大无畏精神的建设者们，为了加速这项工程的建设，仍然不顾困难，展开了同洪水争夺河道的猛烈战斗。新式重型汽车一辆接一辆地从史家滩和三门沟料场将石料运来，大约每一分钟就有一车石料哗啦地往神门河里倾泻，河水被砸得飞溅出高大的浪花。这样不停息地抢投石头，抢筑截流的围堰，将逐步缩窄河道，最后将河道堵塞。
    经过建设者们一年多的改造，现在三门峡的面貌已经发生巨大的变化。左岸的开元新河和梳妆台，早已没有了影踪。人门岛只剩了一段尾巴。张公岛只残存着炼丹炉一块岩石。这一带出现了用钢筋混凝土筑成的供泄水用的十二个梳齿孔，它可以通过一千五百秒公方的流量。梳齿的右侧，顺着原人门岛和张公岛的方向，矗立起长二百六十公尺、最高二十七公尺的纵向钢筋混凝土导水墙、隔墩和隔水墙，这是将来泄水道和水电站的分界线。已炸去一半的神门岛和鬼门岛，又都劈为两半，中间出现了大缺口，做为截流时的泄水道路。鬼门河上横躺着宽大的公路桥，神门河截流用的器材和石料，就在它的上面运过。这座公路桥的下面，已安装好了三扇巨型钢铁闸门，为整个工程的最后截流准备了条件。所有原来的岩岛，现在只剩下几千年来象征我国民族风格的砥柱石，仍然完整地雄立在浪涛中。砥柱石下游，有连接两岸的钢桥，做为往左岸运输大坝建筑物的动脉。右岸有连接陇海铁路的三条现代化交通线：山上和山下，各有一条公路；山上还有一条铁路。两岸山上和山下，摆满了厂房、办公室和职工住房，入夜电灯辉煌，照耀得如同白昼。
    改造黄河的英雄们，去年逼开元新河和人门河的水改走神门河和鬼门河，到今年6月完成了第一期围堰工程。待第二期围堰即神门河和鬼门河围堰工程做好准备后，本月16日十二时起又逼黄河水再走人门河，使神门河水位降低了一尺多。但是，这已不是原来的人门河了，河水现在是通过新建成的十二个梳齿底孔下泄。这是黄河第一次按人们的意志驯服地下泄。这是一年多艰苦工作的胜利。
    这第二期围堰工程，将先堵神门河，再堵鬼门河。截流的方法，是用我国堵口的进占法，从右岸抛石筑堤，逐步前进，逐步缩窄河道，最后合龙，将河道全部堵塞。神门河的截流工程，从17日九时开始演习，因演习顺利，就接着不停息地干起来了。今后，围堰堤越往前伸延，河道越来越窄，河水流速越高，围堰上下游的落差越大，河水的冲击力越来越凶，进占就越来越困难，施工的战斗性也就越来越强。在这样大的流量和这样大的河水落差中截流，不但在我国没有过，在世界上也极少见。具有改造自然的无穷智慧和威力的建设者们，在三天来演习的基础上，正满怀信心地英勇地向狂流展开攻坚战。（附图片）
