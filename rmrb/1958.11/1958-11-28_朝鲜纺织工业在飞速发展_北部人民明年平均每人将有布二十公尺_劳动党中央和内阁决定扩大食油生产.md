Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 26th: A reporter from this agency reports: North Korea's textile industry is developing rapidly. This year, it will produce 120 million meters of cloth, allowing an average of twelve meters per person in northern Korea. This is thirteen times the pre-war level of 1948.

Currently, North Korean textile workers are launching a new upsurge in production, improving equipment utilization and labor productivity, and building new and expanding existing equipment to produce more than 200 million meters of cloth next year. This is three years ahead of the Five-Year Plan target of providing an average of twenty meters of cloth per person in northern Korea by 1961.

In this new upsurge in production, the staff and workers of various textile factories have broken down the blind faith in machine design capabilities. They are rapidly improving technology and launching a movement to drive faster and attend to more machines. At the Pyongyang Textile Factory, the speed of looms has been increased from 200 revolutions per minute to 250 revolutions per minute, and the speed of spinning machines has been increased from 9,000 revolutions per minute to 11,000 to 15,000 revolutions per minute. In the past, a spinning worker who could look after 800 spindles was considered skilled, but recently this has been generally increased to 1,000 spindles.

The staff and workers of the North Korean textile industry sector recently proposed completing the task set by Premier Kim Il-sung of increasing cloth production to 500 million meters within six or seven years, within four years, i.e., by 1962. To this end, they will start expanding the Pyongyang and Guicheng textile factories and the Kaesong weaving factory next year, and build new textile factories in Sinuiju, Hamhung and other places.

North Korea's silk weaving industry has a long history and has undergone unprecedented development in the post-war years. It is now able to produce high-end products such as brocade satin and North Korea's famous Yakshan satin, and exports them in large quantities.

This year, North Korea has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton, producing 60,000 tons of seed cotton, ten times that of last year. Recently, North Korea has made great progress in the research and production of man-made fibers, and has successfully researched and developed the use of corn stalks and rice straw to manufacture fibers. These two raw materials are inexhaustible in North Korea. In addition, a factory using calcium carbide to produce man-made fibers is under construction in Xingnan City. The bumper harvest of cotton and the development of various fiber raw materials have created a foundation for a major leap forward in the textile industry next year.

Northern Korea is mostly mountainous and has always been a region lacking grain and cotton. Now, under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, this year's grain output has reached 3.9 million tons, an increase of more than one million tons compared to pre-war levels. Coupled with the leap forward in the textile industry and the increase in fiber raw materials, northern Korea is rapidly becoming a socialist paradise of abundance.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 27th: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Cabinet of the Republic have adopted a joint decision requiring that the supply of edible oil per person per day in northern Korea reach more than 20 grams within two to three years.

(Editor's note: Each kilogram equals one kilogram)

The decision, published in Pyongyang newspapers today, stated that in order to meet the above supply standard, the total output of various edible oils in northern Korea must reach more than 30,000 tons in 1959 and more than 100,000 tons in 1960.

The decision pointed out that every effort must be made to expand and utilize all oil sources, and the total planting area must reach 30,000 chongbo in 1959 (approximately 15 mu per chongbo).

The decision also called for the widespread use of various agricultural products and nut kernels that can be used to extract oil, and the development of wild oil crop sources.

    朝鲜纺织工业在飞速发展
    北部人民明年平均每人将有布二十公尺
    劳动党中央和内阁决定扩大食油生产
    据新华社平壤26日电　本社记者报道：朝鲜的纺织工业正在飞速发展。今年将生产一亿二千万公尺布匹，使朝鲜北部平均每人可分得十二公尺。这等于战前1948年的十三倍。
    目前，朝鲜纺织工人正掀起新的增产高潮，提高设备利用率和劳动生产率，新建和扩建设备，要在明年生产二亿公尺以上的布匹，提前三年达到五年计划规定的到1961年使朝鲜北部人民平均每人有二十公尺布的目标。
    在这个新的增产高潮中，各纺织厂的职工打破对机器设计能力的迷信。迅速地提高技术，展开了开快车和多看机器的运动。平壤纺织厂的织布机由每分钟二百转提高到二百五十转，纺纱机由九千转提高到一万一千到一万五千转。过去纺纱工一个人看八百个纱锭就算是能手了，最近普遍提高到一千个纱锭。
    朝鲜纺织工业部门的职工们最近提出了在四年以内、即在1962年提前完成金日成首相所提出的在六、七年内增产到五亿公尺布匹的任务。为此，他们要从明年开始扩建平壤、龟城两个纺织厂和开城织物工厂，在新义州、咸兴等地新建纺织厂。
    朝鲜的丝织工业原有悠久的历史，在战后年代里有了空前的发展，现在已能生产织锦缎和朝鲜著名的药山缎等高级产品，并大批出口。
    今年朝鲜的棉花取得空前的丰收，可产籽棉六万吨，等于去年的十倍。最近朝鲜对生产人造纤维的研究有了很大发展，先后研究成功了用玉米秸和稻草制造纤维，这两种原料在朝鲜是取之不尽用之不竭的。另外，在兴南市一座用电石生产人造纤维的工厂正在兴建。棉花的丰收和多种纤维原料的开辟，为明年纺织工业的大飞跃创造了基础。
    朝鲜北部多山，向来是缺粮少棉的地区，现在在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，今年的粮食产量达到了三百九十万吨，比战前增加了一百多万吨。再加上纺织工业的跃进和纤维原料的增产，朝鲜北部正在迅速地变成丰衣足食的社会主义乐园。
    新华社平壤27日电　朝鲜劳动党中央常务委员会和共和国内阁通过联合决定，要求在二至三年内使朝鲜北部人民每人每天的食用油供应量达到二十克以上。
    （编者注：每千克等于一公斤）
    平壤报纸今天刊载的这项决定说，为了达到上述供应标准，1959年朝鲜北部的各种食用油总产量要达到三万吨以上，1960年要达到十万吨以上。
    决定指出，要尽力扩大和利用一切油源，总种植面积在1959年要达到三万町步（每町步约合十五市亩）。
    决定并且要求广泛利用各种可以榨油的农产品和各种果仁榨油，并开辟野生油料作物来源。
