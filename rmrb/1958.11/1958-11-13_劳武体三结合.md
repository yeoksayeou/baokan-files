    Combination of Labor, Military Affairs, and Physical Education
    After the people's commune was established in Badou Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, which had won the National Sports Red Flag Township, sports activities became even more active. During leisure time, on the ridges of fields, in ditches, and at the edge of villages, people could be seen everywhere doing high jumps, parallel bar exercises, throwing stone balls, climbing hanging poles, dancing with carrying poles, and lifting stone cylinders. Commune members often carried various self-made sports equipment with them, going to the mountainous areas spanning dozens of miles, and engaging in exercise in the open spaces of thousands of kiln construction sites.
    The integration of sports and production, and the service of sports to enhancing physical fitness and production, are prominent features of the sports activities in this township. In the first half of the year, in the struggle to transform poor mountains into rich mountains, mountain climbing activities were carried out to strengthen the leg endurance of the commune members. As a result, double-cropping rice was planted on high mountains for the first time. Timber production is one of the main tasks of this township, and in the past, people's arm strength was insufficient, and production efficiency was not high. They therefore universally practiced lifting sand cylinders. After exercise, people who could only lift a hundred catties in the past can now lift one hundred and fifty catties.
    The establishment of the militia regiment has solved the problem of organization and leadership for sports activities in the commune, becoming an excellent sports organization. Exercise groups were established by production unit, and the time for sports exercise was uniformly arranged, thereby ensuring the mass participation and regularity of the activities.
    At present, more than 90% of the people in the township have participated in sports activities, and calisthenics have been widely promoted; one-third of the people have reached the first-grade standard of the Labor and Defense System, and hundreds of people have passed the second-grade and athlete level standards of the Labor and Defense System.

    劳武体三结合
    荣获全国体育运动红旗乡的湖南省湘潭县八斗乡，在人民公社化后，体育运动更加活跃。一到空闲时间，在田埂上，沟壑里和村头村尾，到处可以看见社员们在跳高、翻双杠、掷石球，爬吊竿、舞扁担、举石筒。社员们经常随身携带着各种自制的运动器材，走上纵横数十里的山区，在成千座炭窑的工地上，只有稍有空隙，就进行锻炼。
    体育与生产合为一体，体育为增强体质、生产服务是这个乡开展体育运动的突出特点。上半年，在变穷山为富山的斗争中，为了加强社员们腿部的持久力量，他们就开展了登山活动。因而破天荒地把双季稻插上了高山。生产木材是这个乡的主要任务之一，过去人们臂力不足，生产效率不高。他们就普遍练习举沙筒。经过锻炼，过去能拿百把斤的人，现在都能拿起一百五十多斤。
    民兵团的建立解决了这个社体育运动的组织领导问题，成为一个最好的体育组织。以生产为单位成立锻炼小组，统一安排了体育锻炼时间，从而保证了活动的群众性、经常性。
    目前，全乡90％以上的人参加了体育活动，普遍推行了广播体操；三分之一的人达到了劳卫制一级标准，数百人通过了劳卫制二级和等级运动员标准。
