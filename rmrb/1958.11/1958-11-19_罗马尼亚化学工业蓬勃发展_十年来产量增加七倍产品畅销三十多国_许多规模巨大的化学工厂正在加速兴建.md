    Romanian Chemical Industry Thrives
    Output Increases Sevenfold in Ten Years, Products Sell Well in More Than 30 Countries
    Many Large-Scale Chemical Plants are Being Accelerated

    Bucharest, November 18th (Reporter Ding Man): Romania's chemical industry is developing at a rapid pace. The chemical industry output in 1957 increased sevenfold compared to 1933, the year with the highest annual output before liberation. The total value of chemical consumer goods sold in the first eight months of this year is equivalent to the entire sales volume of 1957. In Bucharest's stores, more than sixty kinds of red, green, and colorful plastic household utensils are sold. These products only started being produced this year.
    Currently, chemical plants are being built in many regions. Among them are: the synthetic rubber plant in Paulesti, the nitrogen fertilizer plant in Roznov, the synthetic fiber plant in Sevinesti, the caustic soda plant in Gherla, the plastic plant in Moldavia, the phosphate fertilizer plant in Navodari, the pulp mill in Braila, and so on. After these large-scale chemical plants are completed, Romania's chemical industry output will have a substantial increase. In the near future, Romania will produce an average of fifteen kilograms of plastic, four kilograms of synthetic fiber, and one and a half kilograms of synthetic rubber per person per year. The production of chemical fertilizers will be astonishing. During the era of landlord and bourgeois rule, Romania could not produce chemical fertilizers itself, but in 1957, it produced 94,000 tons, and by 1970, it will be able to produce one million tons of phosphate fertilizer and two million tons of nitrogen fertilizer.
    Before liberation, Romania's chemical industry was very backward, with its total output value accounting for only 2% of the entire industry. At that time, 72% of the capital of the few chemical plants was controlled by foreign capitalists. After liberation, the Party and the government paid great attention to the development of the chemical industry.
    In developing the chemical industry, Romania has extremely rich natural resources. Romania's natural gas reserves are second only to the Soviet Union in Europe. In 1957, 6.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas were extracted. The oil here is also world-famous, with 11 million tons produced last year. Romania's table salt is enough for the entire world's population to eat for 14,000 years. The reeds in the Danube Delta cover 260,000 hectares, accounting for one-third of the world's reed production. These are all ideal raw materials for the chemical industry.
    In recent years, a series of strong scientific research institutions have been established in Romania around the chemical industry, such as the Petrochemical Research Institute, the Chemical Design Institute, and research institutes for natural gas chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and cellulose chemistry. They have already begun to make important contributions.
    The fraternal cooperation with socialist camp countries has enabled Romania to use its own natural resources for the well-being of the people. In addition to cooperating with Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and Poland to build a pulp mill using reeds from the Danube Delta as raw material, Romania has received selfless assistance from the Soviet Union, especially in developing the chemical industry. The Soviet Union sent chemical experts, provided technical data, supplied complete sets of modern chemical plant equipment, and provided the necessary raw materials. In order to build chemical plants, they obtained preferential loans of 270 million rubles from the Soviet Union.
    Romania's chemical industrial products are now selling well in more than 30 countries.

    罗马尼亚化学工业蓬勃发展
    十年来产量增加七倍产品畅销三十多国
    许多规模巨大的化学工厂正在加速兴建
    本报布加勒斯特18日电　记者丁曼报道：罗马尼亚的化学工业正以飞快的速度发展着。1957年的化学工业产量比解放前年产量最高的1933年增加了七倍。今年前八个月销售的化学消费品的总值已和1957年全年销售量相等。在布加勒斯特的商店里出卖着六十种以上的红红绿绿的塑料制成的家庭用具。这些产品都是今年才开始生产的。
    目前正在许多地区兴建着化学工厂。其中有：保尔捷什蒂的人造橡胶厂、罗兹诺夫的氮肥厂、舍维尼什蒂的人造纤维厂、格瓦拉的烧碱厂、摩尔达维亚的塑料厂、纳伏达里的磷肥厂、勃莱依拉的纸浆厂等等。这些规模巨大的化学工厂建成后，罗马尼亚的化学工业产量将会有很大的增长。在不久以后的年代里，罗马尼亚平均每人每年就会得到十五公斤塑料、四公斤人造纤维、一点五公斤人造橡胶。化学肥料的生产将是惊人的。在地主资产阶级统治时代，罗马尼亚自己不能生产化学肥料，但在1957年生产了九万四千吨，到1970年，将可生产磷肥一百万吨，氮肥二百万吨。
    在解放以前，罗马尼亚的化学工业是很落后的，它的总产值仅占整个工业的2％。那时，有数的几个化学工厂的资本，72％又都操纵在外国资本家手里。在解放以后，党和政府对发展化学工业给予了很大的注意。
    在发展化学工业中，罗马尼亚有极丰富的自然资源。罗马尼亚的天然气储藏量在欧洲仅次于苏联。1957年开采了六十五亿立方公尺天然气。这里的石油也是举世闻名的，去年生产了一千一百万吨。罗马尼亚的食盐，足够全世界的人口吃一万四千年。多瑙河三角洲的芦苇有二十六万公顷，占世界芦苇产量的三分之一。这些都是十分理想的化学工业原料。
    近几年来，在罗马尼亚围绕着化学工业建立起了一系列的强有力的科学研究机关，如石油化学研究所、化学设计院和天然气化学、医药化学、纤维素化学等研究所。它们已经开始作出了重要贡献。
    和社会主义阵营国家的兄弟般的合作，使罗马尼亚有可能利用本国的这些天然富源为人民谋幸福。他们除去和捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国和波兰合作建立一个利用多瑙河三角洲芦苇作原料的纸浆厂外，在发展化学工业中，尤其是得到了苏联的无私的援助。苏联派遣了化学专家，供给了技术资料，提供了整套现代化的化学工厂设备和所必需的原料。为了建设化学工厂，他们从苏联获得了两亿七千万卢布的优惠贷款。
    罗马尼亚的化学工业产品现在畅销三十多国。
