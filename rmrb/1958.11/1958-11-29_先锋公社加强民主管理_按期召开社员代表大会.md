Vanguard Commune Strengthens Democratic Management
	Holds Members' Representative Congress on Schedule
    (Our dispatch) The Vanguard People's Commune in Guiping County, Guangxi, has achieved good results in strengthening democratic management by holding the members' representative congress on schedule.
    After the Vanguard People's Commune was established on August 10, it immediately plunged into the mass campaign to produce steel. During the intense battle for steel, the commune still convened two members' representative congresses in late August and late October, as scheduled by season. The first was to discuss and adopt the commune charter, review the financial revenue and expenditure plan, and elect the president, vice-president, and members of the commune affairs committee. The second was to discuss and adopt the commune's distribution system. Three days before each members' representative congress, the Vanguard Commune first wrote the issues to be resolved at the meeting into written opinions, distributed them to each member representative by company, and then widely collected mass opinions and reflections through the method of big blooming, big contending, and big-character posters with the company as the unit. Then the representatives brought the opinions and big-character posters to the congress. Before the members' representative congress was held, big-character posters were first posted and read, and then the opinions were summarized, sorted out, debated, and resolutions were made.

    先锋公社加强民主管理
    按期召开社员代表大会
    本报讯　广西桂平县先锋人民公社按期召开社员代表大会，加强公社民主管理，效果很好。
    先锋人民公社在8月10日成立后，立即投入全民大办钢铁运动。在紧张的钢铁战斗中，公社于8月下旬和10月下旬，仍按季召开了两次社员代表大会。第一次是讨论通过社章，审查财务收支计划，选举正副社长及社务委员会。第二次是讨论、通过公社的分配制度。先锋公社在每次召开社员代表大会的前三天，先将会议要解决的问题，写成意见书，按连队发给各社员代表，再以连队为单位用大鸣大放大字报的办法，广泛收集群众的意见和反映，然后由代表将意见和大字报，带到大会。社员代表大会开会前，先贴大字报，看大字报，然后将意见归纳、整理、辩论，作出决议。（黄绍进）
