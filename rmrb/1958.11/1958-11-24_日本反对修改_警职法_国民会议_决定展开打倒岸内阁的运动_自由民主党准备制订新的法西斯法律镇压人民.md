Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch: The leading cadres' meeting of Japan's National Conference Against the Evil Revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," held in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 22nd, decided that the national movement to crush the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" will henceforth be transformed into a movement to defend democracy, overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, and dissolve the Diet, in order to combat the reactionary conspiracy of the Nobusuke Kishi government to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The Japan Socialist Party's Central Executive Committee meeting held on the evening of the 22nd decided that the Socialist Party will vigorously launch a movement to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, demand the dissolution of the House of Representatives, and defend democracy.

The meeting also decided to launch a signature campaign demanding the dissolution of the House of Representatives and to fight against the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to enact the "Secrets Protection Law" and revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch: Ten members of the Fukuoka Prefecture Teachers' Union of Japan erected a tent in the square in front of the Prefectural Board of Education on the afternoon of the 22nd and held an indefinite sit-in protest against the government authorities' implementation of the "Performance Evaluation" system.

The Board of Education of Buzen City, Fukuoka Prefecture, also canceled the memorandum exchanged with the labor union a few days ago, which stated that the "Performance Evaluation" system would not be implemented this year. The Fukuoka Prefecture Teachers' Union decided to set up a temporary struggle headquarters in Buzen City again, and the members of the Buzen branch of the Teachers' Union are preparing to hold a strike at noon on November 28.

It is also reported that the Nara Police Station searched the residences of Yasuda, a student at Ritsumeikan University, and Ogawa, a student at Kyoto University, on the morning of the 23rd, allegedly because they had opposed the "Moral Education Lecture Meeting" held in Nara on the 9th of this month. The so-called "Moral Education Lecture Meeting" is a training class organized by the Nobusuke Kishi government to instill militarist ideas into primary and secondary school teachers.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch: The Liberal Democratic Party, the ruling party of Japan, decided at a consultants' meeting held in Tokyo today that the Liberal Democratic Party will study the enactment of new fascist laws to suppress the Japanese people who dare to express their opinions to the Diet.

Masajiro Kawashima, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, said at the meeting: "In order to restore the normal state of the Diet, while studying ways to enhance the authority of the Speaker, we also plan to enact laws to ban demonstrations against the Diet."

Ichiro Kiyose, a consultant of the Liberal Democratic Party, said: "It is necessary to stipulate new crimes of obstructing the performance of public duties to crack down on those who use violence against the Speaker."

The meeting decided to study these issues.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch: Although the Nobusuke Kishi group's conspiracy to turn Japan into a police state again has been severely hit by the Japanese people, it still intends to forcibly pass the bill to amend the "Police Duties Execution Law" at the regular Diet session, which is about to begin on December 10.

According to Japanese radio reports, Nobusuke Kishi held talks with Ichiro Kono, Chairman of the General Affairs Council of the Liberal Democratic Party, today, and they "reached a consensus" that they must find a way to pass the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" at the regular Diet session.

The radio said that leaders of the "mainstream faction" of the Liberal Democratic Party held a meeting on the 21st, and they decided to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" and submit it for discussion again at the beginning of the regular Diet session.

Nobusuke Kishi, with fresh wounds, advocated during his talks with Kono today that "we should see the trend of public opinion" before deciding on the time of submission, and it is not necessarily to be submitted at the beginning of the meeting.

    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本反对恶劣修改“警察官职务执行法”国民会议22日下午在东京举行的领导干部会议决定，今后要把为粉碎“警察官职务执行法修正案”而斗争的国民运动改为保卫民主、打倒岸信介内阁和解散国会的运动，来同岸信介政府企图修改日美“安全条约”的反动阴谋进行斗争。
    日本社会党22日傍晚举行的中央执行委员会会议决定，社会党今后要大力展开打倒岸信介内阁、要求解散众议院和保卫民主的运动。
    会议还决定当前就要展开一个要求解散众议院的签名运动，为反对岸信介政府企图制订“秘密保护法”和修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋而斗争。
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本福冈县教职员工会的十名会员在22日下午到县教育厅前的广场上搭起帐篷，举行无限期静坐斗争，抗议政府当局实施“勤务评定”制度。
    福冈县所属丰前市的教育委员会也取消了日前和工会交换的、声明本年度不实施“勤务评定”制度的备忘录。福冈县教职员工会决定再次在丰前市设立临时斗争总部，准备在11月28日由教职员工会丰前支部的会员在中午举行停止上课的斗争。
    另悉，奈良警察署23日早晨搜查了立命馆大学学生安田和京都大学学生小川的寓所，原因据说是他们两个人曾反对本月9日在奈良开会的“道德教育讲习会”。所谓“道德教育讲习会”是岸信介政府为了对中小学教员灌输军国主义思想而组织的讲习班。
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本执政党自由民主党今天在东京举行的顾问会议决定，自由民主党今后要研究制订新的法西斯法律来镇压敢于向国会表示意见的日本人民的问题。
    自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎在会议上说：“为了恢复国会的正常状态，在研究提高议长权威的方法的同时，还打算制订取缔对国会举行游行示威的法律。”
    自由民主党顾问清濑一郎说：“有必要规定新的妨碍执行公务的罪名，来取缔对议长使用暴力的人。”
    会议决定对这些问题进行研究。
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：岸信介集团企图再度把日本变成警察国家的阴谋，虽然受到日本人民的沉重打击，但是它仍然打算在即将从12月10日开始举行的国会平时会议上强行通过修改“警察官职务执行法”的法案。
    据日本电台报道，岸信介今天同自由民主党总务会长河野一郎举行了会谈，他们“取得一致意见”，一定要设法在国会平时会议上通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”。
    广播说，自由民主党“主流派”领导人员在21日举行了会议，他们决定把“警察官职务执行法修正案”加以修改后，在国会平时会议召开的初期再一次提出讨论。
    创痛犹新的岸信介今天在同河野会谈时，主张“要看看舆论动向”，然后再决定提出的时间，而不一定就在开会的初期就提出。
