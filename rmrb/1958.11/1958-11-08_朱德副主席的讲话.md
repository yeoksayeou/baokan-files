Comrade Ambassador, comrades, friends:

Today is the most glorious festival of the working people of the world—the 41st anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. We, like the working people of the world, celebrate this epoch-making anniversary with boundless joy and excitement. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, allow me to extend the most sincere and warmest congratulations to the Soviet Government and the great Soviet people.

The October Revolution created a fundamental transformation in human life, from darkness to light, from blindness to awareness. It opened a great new era in human history, an era of transition from capitalism to socialism. For more than forty years, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have built a backward and poor Russia into an advanced, prosperous, socialist country that is marching toward communism with selfless labor and unwavering spirit. Today, the Soviet Union has surpassed the most developed capitalist countries in many aspects of economy, culture, science, and technology, and will continue to leave them far behind. A magnificent prospect of a happy communist society has already been displayed before the Soviet people. The history of more than forty years has made it increasingly clear that the path of the October Revolution is the only path for mankind to get rid of the shackles of class exploitation and national enslavement and move towards a bright, happy, and free life.

The great cause pioneered by the October Revolution has now been vigorously developed. Today, socialism has become a powerful world system, forming an invincible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The strength of socialism has gained an overwhelming advantage over the strength of imperialism. The people of the socialist camp countries are building socialism and communism with unparalleled enthusiasm and are making unremitting efforts to defend world peace and safeguard the cause of human progress. Contrary to the thriving situation of the socialist camp, the skies of the capitalist world are shrouded in dark clouds. The phenomena of declining production, economic depression, and increasing unemployment put the capitalist world in a desolate and bleak scene. The great vitality of Marxism-Leninism and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system have become increasingly apparent as time goes on.

The great October Revolution powerfully impacted the imperialist colonial system, causing the colonial system to move towards collapse. Socialist countries, which have eliminated or are eliminating class exploitation at home, have always adhered firmly to national equality and opposed imperialist colonial oppression. The heroic struggles of the colonial peoples received tremendous sympathy and support from the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. At present, the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging like a storm. The victory of the Iraqi people's revolution and the shameful defeat of the US-British aggressors in the Middle East not long ago once again proved that the death of the imperialist colonial system and the liberation of the oppressed nations are irresistible. The development of history will inevitably lead to the final burial of the imperialists in the raging waves of the world's people striving for social and national liberation, and that day is not far away.

When we celebrate the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Revolution, it is particularly worth mentioning that the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries held a meeting in Moscow a year ago and issued a historic declaration. At the same time, the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries issued a peace manifesto. Developments over the past year have further proved the correctness of the important principles pointed out in these two declarations. Today, the solidarity and strength of the socialist camp are more consolidated and stronger than ever before. The Communist Parties of various countries have carried out a serious principled struggle against anti-Marxist-Leninist modern revisionism and have achieved great victories. This is of great significance for safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism and for promoting the development of the international workers' movement. In the past year, we have seen the forces of peace and progress in the world grow stronger, and imperialist aggression has been frustrated everywhere. All this once again proves that the general trend of the current international situation is that the East wind prevails over the West wind, and will continue to prevail over the West wind.

Comrades! It is in this situation that we celebrate the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The changes in the world situation over the past forty years have further proved the truth of Marxism-Leninism and the correctness of the path opened up by the Great October Revolution.

The October Revolution has had an extremely profound impact on the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved the great victory of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution precisely along the path pointed out by the October Revolution. At present, the Chinese people are realizing a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a great development of people's communes, and a technological and cultural revolution with unprecedented revolutionary vigor. The development speed of China's construction is much faster than people expected. All this once again proves to the world how much youthful vitality is contained in communist ideas.

The Chinese people not only have the confidence to build socialism and further transition to communism in a very short historical period, but also have the determination to complete the unification of their great motherland. American imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan for nine years. In these nine years, American imperialists have continuously created tension in the Taiwan region, threatening peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people's struggle to safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity is just, and this struggle has received the full support of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and the deep sympathy of peace-loving countries and people around the world. The Chinese people have long-term struggle experience and know that the ferocious and seemingly powerful imperialism and all reactionaries are actually weak, just as Comrade Mao Zedong said, are paper tigers. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, like all US aggressive bases around the world, are actually nooses around the neck of US imperialism. Now the conspiracy of American imperialism to create new tensions in the Taiwan region has failed shamefully. In order to realize its ambition of long-term occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, the American rulers are painstakingly conspiring to create "two Chinas". However, the Chinese people, including the patriotic soldiers and civilians in the Taiwan region, will never allow the US's conspiracy to succeed. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu must return to the embrace of the motherland, and American imperialism must get out of the Taiwan region.

The Soviet people have always sympathized with and supported the Chinese people. The Chinese people have received tremendous fraternal assistance from the Soviet people in their revolutionary struggle, in their construction, and in the struggle to consolidate the security of their motherland and maintain international peace. The Chinese people will never forget this internationalist assistance. The friendship forged between the Chinese and Soviet people is unprecedented. This friendship is the strongest and invincible pillar of world peace and the cause of human progress. This friendship was further strengthened by the meeting between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev in Beijing in August this year. The Chinese people will continue to do their best to consolidate and develop the great friendship with the Soviet people, strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and strengthen the unity with all peace forces in the world.

Comrades and friends, on this festive day that is jointly celebrated by the progressive humanity of the world, I propose:

For the great October Socialist Revolution,

For the great Soviet people who are building communism,

For the eternal and unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people,

For the great unity of the big family of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union,

For the health of the leading comrades of the Communist Party and Government of the Soviet Union,

Cheers.

### 朱德副主席的讲话

专栏：

    朱德副主席的讲话亲爱的大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天是全世界劳动人民最光辉的节日——伟大十月社会主义革命四十一周年。我们同全世界劳动人民一样，怀着无比的喜悦和兴奋的心情来庆祝这个划时代的纪念日。我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向苏联政府和伟大的苏联人民致最诚挚、最热烈的祝贺。
    十月革命造成了人类生活从黑暗走到光明，从盲目走到自觉的根本转变。它开辟了人类历史的一个伟大的新时代，从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时代。四十多年来，苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党的领导下，以忘我的劳动和坚忍不拔的精神把一个落后的、贫弱的俄国建设成为一个先进的、富强的、建成了社会主义并且正在向共产主义迈进的国家。今天，苏联在经济、文化和科学、技术的许多方面，已经超过了最发达的资本主义国家，并且还会继续把它们远远地抛在后面。在苏联人民面前，已经展示出一幅幸福的共产主义社会的宏伟前景。四十多年的历史使人们日益清楚地看出，十月革命的道路，是人类摆脱阶级剥削和民族奴役制度的枷锁而走向光明、幸福和自由生活的唯一道路。
    十月革命所开创的伟大事业，现在已经得到了汹涌澎湃的发展。今天，社会主义已经成为强大的世界体系，形成了一个以苏联为首的不可战胜的社会主义阵营。社会主义的力量对于帝国主义的力量已经占了压倒的优势。社会主义阵营各国的人民，正在以无比的热情，建设着社会主义和共产主义，并且为捍卫世界和平和维护人类进步事业进行着不懈的努力。和社会主义阵营的欣欣向荣的情况相反，资本主义世界的上空却笼罩着一片乌云。生产下降，经济萧条，失业增加的现象，使资本主义世界面临一种秋风萧瑟的凄凉情景。马克思列宁主义的伟大生命力和社会主义制度的无比优越性，已经随着时间的推移，愈加明显地显示出来。
    伟大的十月革命有力地冲击了帝国主义殖民制度，使殖民制度日益走向崩溃。在国内消灭了或者正在消灭阶级剥削制度的社会主义国家一贯坚持民族平等、反对帝国主义殖民压迫。殖民地人民的英勇斗争得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的巨大同情和支持。目前，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动正在风起云涌，怒涛澎湃。不久以前伊拉克人民革命的胜利和美英侵略者在中近东地区的可耻的失败，又一次证明了帝国主义殖民制度的死亡和被压迫民族的解放是不可抗拒的。历史的发展必然将使帝国主义者最后全部葬身于世界人民争取社会解放和民族解放的怒涛中，而且这个日子已经不远了。
    在我们庆祝伟大的十月革命四十一周年的时候，特别值得一提的是一年以前社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科举行了会议，并且发表了具有历史意义的宣言，同时各国共产党和工人党代表发表了和平宣言。一年以来的发展进一步证明了这两个宣言所指出的重大原则的正确性。今天，社会主义阵营的团结和力量比过去任何时候都更加巩固、更加强大了。各国共产党对反马克思列宁主义的现代修正主义进行了严肃的原则斗争，并且获得了巨大的胜利。这对于捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，促进国际工人运动的发展具有伟大的意义。在过去一年中，我们看到全世界的和平和进步力量更加壮大了，帝国主义的侵略行动处处遭到挫败。这一切再一次证明了目前国际形势的总的趋势是东风压倒西风，而且还将继续压倒西风。
    同志们！我们就是在这种形势下来庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十一周年的。四十多年来世界形势的变化，更加证明了马克思列宁主义的真理，证明了伟大十月革命所开辟的道路的正确性。
    十月革命对中国人民具有极其深刻的影响。中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，正是沿着十月革命所指出的道路，取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利的。目前中国人民正在以空前的革命干劲实现工农业生产的大跃进、人民公社大发展和技术、文化革命。中国建设事业的发展速度，比人们预计的要快得多。这一切向全世界再一次证明了共产主义思想蕴藏着多么大的青春活力。
    中国人民不仅有信心在很短的历史时期内建成社会主义和进一步向共产主义过渡，而且有决心完成自己伟大祖国的统一。美国帝国主义侵占我国的领土台湾，已经九年了，九年中，美国帝国主义者不断在台湾地区制造紧张局势，威胁远东和世界的和平，中国人民维护自己主权和领土完整的斗争是正义的，这个斗争得到苏联和其他社会主义国家的全力支持和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的深切同情。中国人民具有长期的斗争经验，深知穷凶极恶的、貌似强大的帝国主义和一切反动派实际上是虚弱的，正如毛泽东同志所说的，是一只纸老虎。台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖，和美国在全世界的一切侵略基地一样，实际上是套在美国帝国主义脖子上的绞索。现在美国帝国主义在台湾地区制造新的紧张局势的阴谋已经可耻地破产了。美国统治者为了实现长期霸占中国领土台湾的野心，正在处心积虑地阴谋制造“两个中国”。但是，中国人民包括台湾地区的爱国军民同胞决不会允许美国的这种阴谋得逞。台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖必须回到祖国的怀抱，美国帝国主义必须从台湾地区滚出去。
    苏联人民一贯同情和支持中国人民。中国人民无论在革命斗争中、在建设事业中、在巩固自己祖国的安全和维护国际和平的斗争中，都得到苏联人民巨大的兄弟般的援助。对于这种国际主义的援助，中国人民将永志不忘。中苏两国人民所结成的友谊，是史无前例的。这个友谊，是世界和平和人类进步事业的最强大的、不可战胜的支柱。今年8月，毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志在北京的会谈，使这一友谊得到了更进一步的加强。中国人民将继续用全力来巩固和发展同苏联人民的伟大友谊，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，并且加强同世界上一切和平力量的团结。
    同志们和朋友们，在这个全世界进步人类共同欢庆的节日里，我提议：
    为伟大的十月社会主义革命，
    为正在建设共产主义的伟大的苏联人民，
    为中苏两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国大家庭的伟大团结，
    为苏联共产党和政府领导同志们的健康，
    干杯。
