Good News from Central Sichuan

The first exploratory well in Yingshan, central Sichuan, struck crude oil in early October. The well produced 17 tons of oil in 58 hours. The oil-bearing stratum of this well belongs to the same stratum as the Nanchong and Longnüsi structures, which have produced large amounts of oil. The oil strike in this well not only confirms that Yingshan is an oil field but will also expand the oil-bearing area of the central Sichuan oil region.

    川中喜讯
    川中营山第一口探井在10月初出了原油。这口探井在五十八小时内出油十七吨。这口探井出油的层位与大量喷油的南充和龙女寺构造属于同一层位。这口探井的出油，不仅证实营山是一个油田，而且使川中油区的储油面积将得到扩大。
