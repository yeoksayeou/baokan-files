A Major Revolution in Cultivation Systems
Liu Zhendong, First Secretary of the CPC An'guo County Committee

This year, An'guo County is vigorously developing large-scale, high-yield wheat fields. The county has sown 400,000 mu of wheat, aiming for a yield of 5,000 jin per mu and striving for 10,000 jin. Within all the wheat fields, 22 large plots, totaling more than 186,000 mu, are planned with a yield target of 15,000 jin per mu, striving for 20,000 jin. These wheat fields are large, square, and have basically achieved regionalized planting, advanced gardening, standardized sowing, and scientific management. This is a major revolution in our county's cultivation system.

The realization of this in An'guo is not accidental.

        Valuable Experiences of the Masses

As early as before the wheat planting last year, some facts drew our attention: some villages had less land, meticulous cultivation, high grain yields, and affluent lives; other villages had more land, rough cultivation, low grain yields, and difficult lives. Was the former's land of better quality? Not necessarily. Some of them achieved high yields even on poor land. The latter, on the other hand, had some good land, but the yield could not be improved due to poor cultivation. At that time, we thought: could we set aside some land for planting alfalfa and concentrate our efforts on cultivating the other part well? This would not only increase grain production but also save labor. However, we didn't feel fully confident in doing so. At the same time, considering the national situation, it was still advocated to make full use of the land, plant more, and harvest more, so we didn't do it. This year's many high-yield facts have further led us to consider this issue. This year, our county saw wheat yields of more than 5,000 jin per mu, corn yields of more than 20,000 jin per mu, and multi-headed sorghum yields of more than 40,000 jin per mu. Calculated at this yield, one mu of sorghum is almost equal to the yield of 100 mu in normal times. So, is it better for us to concentrate our efforts on planting one mu of land, or to spread our efforts on planting 100 mu? We repeatedly considered this question but couldn't make a decision. In August of this year, Chairman Mao came to our county to inspect the work and instructed us to use the "three-three system" for farming in the future: one part for cultivation, one part for fallow, and one part for planting trees and grass to develop forestry and animal husbandry. This instruction completely conformed to the actual situation of agricultural development in our country and also gave a clear direction to the problem we had been considering for a long time.

Before the autumn harvest and wheat planting, we discussed this year's wheat planting issue at the county party committee meeting, unified our understanding, and unanimously agreed to adopt revolutionary methods to develop large-scale, high-yield fields. Based on the principle of adapting to local conditions, we formulated a wheat planting plan. Our county has 920,000 mu of cultivated land, and we decided to sow 400,000 mu of wheat with a yield of 5,000 jin per mu. Nearly half of this would be high-yield fields, aiming for 15,000 jin per mu. By achieving this plan, each person in the county can get an average of 5,000 jin of wheat. This can change the current situation of mainly relying on sorghum, sweet potatoes, and corn as staple foods to relying on wheat as the staple food. Everyone in the county can eat white flour, and at the same time, we can provide a large amount of wheat to support the state.

From the original planting of more, dispersed planting, to planned, concentrated planting, less planting, and implementing the "three-three system" of combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, this is a revolution in the cultivation system.

From the original relatively extensive cultivation, planting more and harvesting less, to intensive cultivation, planting less and harvesting more, and realizing large-scale, high-yield and advanced gardening, this is a revolution in cultivation technology.

Clearly Distinguishing Principles, Thorough Reform

To adapt to the major changes in cultivation systems and cultivation techniques, there must also be a great leap forward in people's thinking.

This is a new task, how to lead and mobilize the masses to do it? Our first step was to conduct pilot projects. Through pilot projects, cadres gained experience and created "models" to educate the masses. We first mobilized members of the Dongfeng People's Commune to discuss how to plant wheat well this year. In the discussion, everyone said that planting wheat around Wurenqiao Village was the most suitable. The land there is fertile, and the masses have experience in managing wheat fields. Planting three mu elsewhere is not as good as planting one mu there. The principle of adapting to local conditions and regionalized planting was quickly accepted by the masses and became their opinion. The entire commune planned a thousand-mu wheat field outside Wurenqiao Village. Then, the masses were mobilized to discuss that to plant wheat well, it is necessary to deep plow, apply more fertilizer, sow more seeds, and also be able to irrigate to achieve gardening. But to do this, relying solely on the strength of one production team in Wurenqiao is fundamentally impossible. What to do? We must adopt the method of large-scale operations. This broke the original thinking of planting land by village and team.

But in the middle of wheat planting, problems arose again: people from outside villages and teams felt that they had brought their labor, fertilizer, and seeds to this place, and if they didn't plant wheat in their own villages and teams, would they be able to eat white flour in the future? They always felt that it was more convenient to plant near their own homes. Some people in Wurenqiao Village were also worried that people from other villages would not be responsible for their work, would not plant well, and were also afraid that everyone would share their wheat in the future. When this problem was discovered, a meeting was held for debate: Whose is the Dongfeng People's Commune? Who eats the wheat that is planted? Will planting this way result in more or less production? After debate, the idea of localism was criticized, and communist ideology was increased, further clarifying that the commune belongs to everyone, and everyone concentrates their efforts to plant wheat well so that everyone can eat white flour.

There are always ideological problems; solve them promptly when discovered. When the weather got a bit cold, the masses' thoughts fluctuated again: the quality requirements are so high, when will we finish planting? I am afraid that we will not finish planting until the Beginning of Winter or Light Snow. Some people wanted to be perfunctory and hastily conclude the work. Some commune leaders also wavered, saying: Can we continue to plant like this? Can't we loosen up and let go? So the county party committee mobilized the masses to debate: This year's wheat planting is relatively tight in terms of time, but should we deep plow, apply more fertilizer, and plant well so that the wheat grows well, or should we plant casually and expect it to grow well? The masses compared the two approaches, analyzed the advantages and disadvantages, and believed that we should still firmly plant wheat well according to the original quality requirements. Some who had planted casually secretly plowed it again overnight and replanted it well.

Propose Plans, Make Good Models

To plant large-scale, high-yield fields and achieve advanced gardening, it is also necessary to solve technical problems. If only specifications and standards are proposed, and the masses do not know how to do it, it will still not work. According to our experience, the best way to solve technical problems is to create "model fields." At the beginning, we based it on the militia backbone team in the Dongfeng Commune, absorbing some ideologically advanced, technically experienced old farmers and leaders to participate, and used all kinds of high-yield measures on a thousand-mu field to plant it into a large-scale advanced garden field. After making a model, we mobilized cadres and the masses to visit and held on-site meetings. This had a great impact on the masses' thinking, and people talked about it: "The land in Wurenqiao has undergone a major transformation! The strength of the People's Commune is great. If one village were to plant this kind of land, let alone plowing, they couldn't even sow it." With this model, cadres and the masses can learn to do it. For some people with conservative ideas, it is difficult to persuade them by just talking about principles, but when they go to see the "model field," they are convinced: "It's true, the land they plant is like embroidery!" After returning, they automatically leveled the planted land and replanted it according to the new method.

See the Direction Clearly, Advance Courageously

The masses and cadres of An'guo County, after a month of day and night fighting, have completed the wheat planting task according to the plan. It has laid the foundation for the reform of the agricultural cultivation system in our county. The county party committee has the following experiences in leading this work:

First, recognize the direction, work hard, and strive for the upper reaches. Planting less, planting well, and harvesting more, and implementing the "three-three system" for farmland cultivation, is the inevitable trend of future agricultural production development. Under the instructions of Chairman Mao, we clarified the direction and immediately mobilized the masses, tapped all labor potential, and adopted the method of large-scale operations, working hard and making breakthroughs day and night. The situation faced in this year's wheat planting is: more than half of the county's young and middle-aged labor force has gone to the mountains to make iron and repair reservoirs, and the autumn harvest tasks at home are heavy; but the wheat planting area has increased by more than double compared to previous years, the quality requirements are high, and planting one mu of wheat requires two or three times more labor. Therefore, labor is extremely tight. Under these circumstances, if the leadership hesitates slightly in their thinking and the determination to strive for the upper reaches is not strong, it would not be possible to plant so much wheat so well.

Second, carry forward the revolutionary enthusiasm and heroic spirit of the masses in splitting mountains and filling the sea, despise difficulties, and overcome difficulties. Planting tens of thousands of mu of large-scale high-yield fields, requiring advanced gardening, deep plowing of the land for several feet, leveling pits, changing roads, raising heights, and lowering lows to achieve a major transformation of the land, the masses and cadres all have a fear of difficulties. If the leadership wavers slightly, it will not be accomplished. Facts have proved that as long as the masses are vigorously mobilized, no difficulties can stand in the way. In the Vanguard Commune's "ten-thousand-mu satellite field," there was a large ditch several miles long, and by mobilizing the masses, it was filled overnight.

Third, discussions of plans and measures should highly promote democracy and widely absorb the opinions and wisdom of the masses; execution must be highly centralized and without hesitation. If you don't believe it, just look; if you don't understand it, just debate; if there are difficulties, mobilize the masses to solve them; the determined plans must be resolutely completed.

    耕作制度的一次大革命
    中共安国县委第一书记　刘振宗
    今年安国县大搞小麦大面积高额丰产田。全县播种小麦四十万亩，要求亩产五千斤，力争一万斤。在全部麦田中，又规划出二十二大片，共十八万六千多亩，亩产指标一万五千斤，力争二万斤。这部分麦田，大片成方，基本上实现了种植区域化，高级园田化，播种规格化和管理科学化。这是我县耕作制度上的一个大革命。
    这件事在安国的实现并不是偶然的。
        群众的宝贵经验
    早在去年种麦之前，有些事实就引起我们的注意：有一部分村子，土地少，耕作细致，打粮多，生活富足；另一部分村子，土地多，耕作粗糙，打粮少，生活困难。前者的地是土质好吗？不尽然，有些恰恰是在不好的地上获得了高额丰产。后者却有些是好地，但由于耕种得不好，产量也提不高。那时我们就想：是不是可以抽出一部分土地种苜蓿，集中力量把另一部分地种好，这样不仅可以多打粮食，还能节省劳力。但这样作觉得还没有十分的把握。同时，就全国的情况来看，当时还是提倡充分利用土地，多种多收，我们也就没有那样作。今年的许多高额丰产事实，更进一步引起我们考虑这个问题。今年我县出现了亩产五千多斤的小麦，亩产二万多斤的玉米，亩产四万多斤的多穗高粱。按这个产量计算，这一亩高粱，差不多等于平常一百亩的产量。那么，我们是集中力量种一亩地好呢，还是分散力量种一百亩好呢？我们反复地考虑着这个问题，下不了决心。今年8月间，毛主席来我县视察工作，指示我们今后可以用“三三制”的办法种地，一部分耕种，一部分休闲，一部分种树种草，发展林、牧业。这一指示完全符合我国农业发展的实际情况，也使我们考虑很久的问题有了明确的方向。
    秋收种麦之前，我们在县委会上讨论今年的种麦问题，统一了认识，大家一致同意采取革命的办法，搞大面积高额丰产田。并根据因地制宜的原则，制订出小麦播种计划。我县共有耕地九十二万亩，决定播种小麦四十万亩，亩产五千斤，其中并有将近一半的高额丰产田，亩产一万五千斤，实现了这个计划，全县每人平均可以得到五千斤麦子。这就可以把今年以高粱、甘薯、玉米为主食的情况，改变为以小麦为主食，全县人人吃白面，同时还可以拿出大量小麦支援国家。
    从原来的多种、分散地种，到有计划地、集中地种，少种，实行农、林、牧相结合的“三三制”，这是耕作制度上的一次革命。
    从原来的耕作比较粗放，种的多，收的少，到精耕细作，种的少，收的多，实现大面积高额丰产和高级园田化，这是耕作技术上的一个革命。
    辩理分明　改革彻底
    适应耕作制度和耕作技术上的大变革，在人的思想上也必须有一个大跃进。
    这是一件新的工作，如何领导和发动群众来作？我们第一步是先搞试点。通过搞试点，干部取得了经验，并作出“样板”教育群众。我们先在东风人民公社发动社员讨论，怎样把今年的小麦种好？在讨论中，大家都说在五仁桥村周围种麦最合适。那里土地肥沃，群众又有管理麦田的经验，别处种三亩，也不顶那地方种一亩。因地制宜、种植区域化的原则很快为群众所接受，成为群众的意见。全社就在五仁桥村外规划了一块千亩麦田。接着又发动群众讨论，要把麦子种好，必须深翻、多施肥、多下种，还要能灌溉、达到园田化。但是要这样做，单靠五仁桥一个生产队的力量根本作不到，怎么办？必须采取大兵团作战的办法。这就把原来以村、队为单位种地的思想打破了。
    但是在种麦的中间，又出现了问题：外村、外队的人觉得，把自己劳力、肥料、籽种都弄到这地方来了，本村、本队不种麦子，今后是不是吃得上白面？总觉得不如种在自己家门口吃着方便。五仁桥村也有人担心，怕外村来的人做活不负责任，种不好，又怕将来大家都分自己的麦子吃。发现了这个问题，就开会进行辩论：东风人民公社是谁的？种的麦子归谁吃？这么种是多打还是少打？经过辩论，批判了本位主义思想，增加了共产主义思想，进一步明确了公社是大家的，大家集中力量把麦子种好，人人都可以吃得上白面。
    思想问题总是有的，及时发现就及时解决。当天气有些冷了，群众的思想又波动起来：质量要求这么高，种到什么时候？恐怕到立冬、小雪也种不完。有些人就想马虎从事，草草收兵。有的公社领导干部也有些动摇，他们说：咱们照这样种，种得下去吗？不能松松口，放放手吗？于是县委发动群众进行辩论：今年种麦在时间上是比较紧一些，但我们是要深翻、多施肥、好好种上，麦子长得好呢？还是马马虎虎种上，就可以长得好？群众对比了两种作法，分析了利害，认为还是应该按原来的质量要求，坚决把小麦种好。有些马马虎虎种了的，又连夜偷着翻了，重新好好种。
    提出规划　作好样板
    要种大面积的高额丰产田，达到高级园田化，还必须解决技术问题。如果光提出规格标准，群众不晓得怎么作，还是搞不成的。根据我们的经验，解决技术问题最好的办法是搞“样板田”。一开始，我们就在东风公社以民兵基干队为基础，吸收一些思想先进、有技术的老农和领导干部参加，在一块千亩大的田上，运用一切丰产措施，把它种成大片高级化的园田。作出了样子，就发动干部、群众参观，召开现场会议。这么作对群众的思想影响很大，人们纷纷谈论：“五仁桥的土地大翻身啦！还是人民公社的力量大，这样的地要一个村来种，别说翻地，光耩地也耩不了。”有了这个样子，干部、群众就可以学着干。对于一些有保守思想的人，光讲道理很难说服他，可是跑到“样板田”一看，他就信服了：“真是呵，人家种的地像绣花一样！”回去以后，就自动把已经种的平了，按新办法重新种。
    看清方向　勇往直前
    安国县的群众和干部，前后经过一个月的日夜鏖战，种麦任务已经按计划胜利完成。它给我县农业耕作制度的改革打下了基础。县委对这件工作的领导，有这样几点体会：
    第一，认清方向，大干特干，力争上游。种的少，种的好，收的多，农田耕作实行“三三制”，这是今后农业生产发展必然的趋势。我们在毛主席的指示下，明确了方向，就立即发动群众，挖掘一切劳动潜力，采取大兵团作战的办法，大干特干，昼夜突击。今年种麦所面临的情况是：全县有一半以上的青壮年劳力上山炼铁和修水库，家里秋收任务重；但种麦面积却比往年增加一倍多，质量要求高，种一亩麦需要增加两三倍的劳力，因此显得劳力异常紧张。在这种情况下，领导思想上如果少有犹豫，争上游的决心不大，麦子就不可能种这么多，这么好。
    第二，发扬群众的革命干劲和劈山填海的英雄气概，蔑视困难，战胜困难。种千万亩的大片丰产田，要求高级园田化，地深翻数尺，平坑改道，起高垫低，使土地大翻身，群众和干部都有畏难情绪，如领导上稍有动摇，就干不成。事实证明，只要大力发动群众，什么困难也不能挡道。先锋社的“万亩卫星田”中，有几里长的一条大沟，发动起群众，一夜就把它填平了。
    第三，讨论计划、措施，要高度发扬民主，广泛吸收群众的意见和智慧；执行时必须高度集中，毫不犹豫。不信就看，不通就辩，有困难就发动群众解决，确定的计划必须坚决完成。
