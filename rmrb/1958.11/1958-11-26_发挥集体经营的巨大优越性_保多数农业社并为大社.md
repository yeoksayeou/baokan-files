Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: According to TASS reports, a widespread movement to merge agricultural cooperatives has unfolded in Bulgarian rural areas. Currently, the vast majority of cooperatives have been merged into large cooperatives.

As a result of the mergers, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide has decreased from 3,457 to 1,470, and their land accounts for more than 92% of the country's cultivated land area.

The merger movement has transformed Bulgarian agricultural production cooperatives into huge economic units. For example, last year 57% of the country's agricultural production cooperatives had less than 10,000 decares of land (one decare is approximately 1.5 mu), while now each agricultural cooperative in the Vratsa region owns an average of 68,000 decares of land, and in the Pleven region each cooperative owns an average of more than 59,000 decares of land. This enables the cooperatives to give fuller play to the great superiority of collective management.

    发挥集体经营的巨大优越性
    保多数农业社并为大社
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社报道：保加利亚农村展开了一个广泛的合并农业合作社的运动。目前，绝大多数的合作社都并为大社。
    由于并社的结果，全国三千四百五十七个农业生产合作社减少为一千四百七十个，它们的土地占全国耕地面积的92％以上。
    并社运动使保加利亚的农业生产合作社变成了巨大的经济单位。例如，去年全国57％的农业生产合作社拥有不到一万狄卡尔的土地（一狄卡尔约合一市亩半），而现在弗拉查州的每个农业合作社平均拥有六万八千狄卡尔土地，在普勒文州每个社平均拥有五万九千多狄卡尔的土地。这样就使合作社能够更充分发挥集体经营的巨大优越性。
