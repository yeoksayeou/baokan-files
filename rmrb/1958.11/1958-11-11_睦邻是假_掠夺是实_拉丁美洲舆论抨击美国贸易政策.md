　　Based on reports from our newspaper: Recently, the practice of American monopoly capital to harm the economic interests of Latin American countries in order to ensure its own profits has been severely criticized by Latin American politicians and newspapers. This storm was caused by the U.S. reduction in imports of lead and zinc from Latin America.

　　Peru's "La Prensa" revealed in an editorial that the U.S. adopted this discriminatory trade policy in order to protect a limited number of American mining companies, because "their production costs are very high, and their interests are damaged by the greater competitiveness of other countries in the Americas."

　　Eduardo Porralo, chairman of the Mining Affairs Committee of the Peruvian Senate, accused the United States of only remembering the so-called "Good Neighbor Policy" when it is in its own interest, "and forgetting it afterwards." He pointed out that the U.S.'s unilateral policy of restricting imports "seriously affects" Peru's economic situation.

　　Colombia's "El Tiempo," commenting on the discriminatory measures taken by the U.S. in trade, emphasized that "there exists a colonial economic system which, although different from the political system, leads to the same tragic results."

　　Mexico's "Siempre!" weekly also pointed out that an important obstacle to economic cooperation among Latin American countries is economic inequality.

### 睦邻是假　掠夺是实  拉丁美洲舆论抨击美国贸易政策

    睦邻是假　掠夺是实
    拉丁美洲舆论抨击美国贸易政策
    本报综合报道　最近以来，美国垄断资本采取损害拉丁美洲国家的经济利益来保证自己的利润的做法，日益受到拉丁美洲的政治家和报纸的严厉抨击。这场风波是因为美国削减从拉丁美洲进口铅锌而引起的。
    秘鲁的“新闻报”在一篇社论中揭穿了美国采取这种歧视性贸易政策，是为了保护一批为数有限的美国采矿公司，因为“它们的生产费用很高，它们的利益遭到美洲其他国家竞争能力更大的损害。”
    秘鲁参议院矿业问题委员会主席爱德华多·波腊罗指责美国只在对自己有利时才记得所谓“睦邻政策”，“过后就把它忘了”。他指出，美国这种单方面限制进口的政策“严重地影响了”秘鲁的经济状况。
    哥伦比亚“时代报”在评论美国在贸易方面采取的歧视措施时着重指出，“存在着这样一种殖民主义经济制度，这种经济制度虽然与政治制度不同，但是导致的悲惨结果却是与它相同的。”
    墨西哥“永久”周刊也指出，在拉丁美洲国家经济合作方面的重要障碍是经济上的不公平。
