What are the Uses of Animal Medicinal Materials?
	Zhang Yingcai

	Chinese medicinal materials are derived from plants, animals, and minerals, with animal medicinal materials accounting for a significant proportion. The Han Dynasty's "Shen Nong's Materia Medica" recorded 365 kinds of medicines, of which 65 were animal medicinal materials. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" by Li Shizhen in the Ming Dynasty and the "Supplement to the Compendium of Materia Medica" by Zhao Xuemin in the Qing Dynasty increased the number of animal medicinal materials to 566. The scope of animals used as medicinal materials is very wide. Some use bones, some use skin, some use blood, some use horns, some use secretions or by-products, and some use the whole body as medicine.

	China's animal medicinal materials come from all directions. Tigers, musk deer, and deer living in the wild mountains, turtles, tortoises, mussels, and clams living in the water, bats that can fly and prey, pangolins crawling on the ground, white-flowered snakes, scorpions and mole crickets hidden in earthen walls and stone crevices, spiders and blister beetles among insects, cicadas栖juing on trees, frogs on riverside grasslands, as well as rhinoceroses in the tropics and antelopes in the cold regions, etc. Animal medicinal materials have a wide range of uses, and I will briefly describe several of them.

	Musk: It has the functions of clearing the orifices, dispelling foulness, searching for wind, and dispelling evil. Modern studies have proved that it is also a medicine for sterilization, detoxification, nerve stimulation, and unblocking meridians. It also has considerable effectiveness in treating many serious diseases such as encephalitis B and cerebritis. According to incomplete statistics, there are as many as 116 kinds of Chinese patent medicines prepared with musk. Musk is a unique fragrant liquid secreted from the hair follicles behind the navel of male musk deer. The yield is very small, so during hunting, planned protection and artificial breeding should be carried out.

	Tiger bone: Whether decocted in water, soaked in wine, or boiled into gelatin, it has the effect of dispelling wind and treating flaccidity and paralysis. It is a special medicine for strengthening bones, wind-cold-dampness arthralgia, and muscle and bone pain. All diseases that treat numbness of hands and feet, difficulty in walking, and back and leg pain cannot be separated from tiger bone. The amount of Chinese patent medicine that requires tiger bone as a raw material is very large. For example, tiger bone medicinal wine for treating rheumatism is popular at home and abroad. Tigers grow slowly and have low reproductive capacity, and current production cannot keep up with demand.

	Bear: Bear oil, bear bile, bear paws, etc., all have medical value, especially "bear bile," which has the greatest use. It is a medicine for removing nebula and improving eyesight, killing insects and treating malnutrition, relieving spasms and stimulating, and compensating for insufficient bile. Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica comments on bear bile, saying, "It reduces fever and clears the heart, calms the liver and improves eyesight, removes nebula and kills pinworms." In summer, the broad masses of people like to take "Wanying Pills" to prevent heatstroke and cholera, which contain bear bile.

	Toad: The most common kind of animal. The oil in the abdomen produced in Northeast China is called toad oil, which is a tonic medicinal material for treating neurasthenia. The white漿 juice secreted by the brow ridges produced in East China and North China is called chan酥, which is the main medicine for treating surgical diseases. Its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects are significant. Modern clinical studies have proved that it can also treat heart failure. The special medicine for treating throat diseases, "Liu Shen Wan," contains chan酥.

	The above two medicinal materials are in great demand in the medical field and are easy to produce, so they should be vigorously developed.

	Scorpion: The medicinal name is whole scorpion, also called whole insect. It has great medical effects. Li Shizhen said that it can treat "children's epilepsy and convulsions, adult malaria, deafness, hernia, all kinds of wind sores, and women's vaginal discharge and prolapse." Modern inventions have shown that it is an effective medicine for treating leprosy, Kashin-Beck disease, etc. Most of the patent medicines for treating epilepsy and wind evil need to be prepared with scorpions. Currently, there are 36 kinds of patent medicines made with scorpions. Due to insufficient wild production, some areas are studying artificial breeding.

	Qishe: Also known as the white-flowered snake, it is produced in the deep mountains of the southern region. Its main use is to treat all kinds of wind diseases, such as adult stroke, nerve paralysis, crooked mouth and eyes, hemiplegia, bone and joint pain, and numbness. It is an indispensable medicine in the preparation of Chinese patent medicines such as "Huisheng Zaizao Wan," "Da Huo Luo Dan," and various rheumatic medicinal wines.

	Other animal medicinal materials also have great medical effects, such as cicada slough for treating colds and relieving the exterior,鱉甲 for softening indurations, earthworms for relieving heat and unblocking meridians,鹿茸, 鹿肾, and 海狗肾 for warming and tonifying, turtle plastron for nourishing yin and replenishing blood, gecko for benefiting the lungs and relieving asthma, pearls for generating flesh and improving eyesight, hawksbill turtle for calming and tranquilizing, centipede, ginger silkworm and other medicines for epilepsy and rheumatism.

    动物药材有些什么用途
    张颖才
    中药材来源于植物、动物、矿物很多方面，而动物药材占着很大的比重。汉代“神农本草经”记载药物三百六十五种，其中动物药材就有六十五种。明朝李时珍“本草纲目”和清朝赵学敏的“本草拾遗”收载的动物药材增至五百六十六种。动物做药材的范围很广，有的用骨，有的用皮，有的用血，有的用角，有的用分泌物或副产物，有的全身都是药。
    我国的动物药材，来自四面八方。生在野山中的虎、麝、鹿，生活在水中的龟、鳖、蚌、蛤，能飞捕食的蝙蝠，地上爬的穿山甲，白花蛇，藏在土墙石缝中的蝎子、土鳖虫，昆虫中的蜘蛛、斑蟊，栖居树上的蝉，河边草地的青蛙，以及热带的犀牛和寒带的羚羊等等。动物药材用途很广，现简略说它几种。
    麝香：有通窍、辟秽、搜风、驱邪的作用，近代证明它还是杀菌、解毒、兴奋神经、通经窜络的药品，治疗乙型脑炎和大脑炎等许多严重疾病也有相当成效。据不完全统计，用麝香配制的中成药，计有一百一十六种之多。麝香是雄麝腹脐后所生的毛囊中分泌的一种奇香液体，产量很小，因此在猎取时，应有计划的予以保护和进行人工饲养。
    虎骨：无论水煎、酒浸或熬胶，都有追风治疗痿痹的作用，为健骨、风寒湿痹、筋骨疼痛的特效药，凡是治疗手足麻木，行步艰难，腰痛腿疼的疾病，都不能离开虎骨。需用虎骨作原料的中成药，用量很大，如治疗风湿病的虎骨药酒，在国内外均受欢迎。虎生长缓慢，繁殖力小，目前生产还赶不上需要。
    熊：熊油、熊胆、熊掌等，都有医疗价值，特别是“熊胆”，用途最大，是去翳明目，杀虫治疳，镇痉兴奋，补偿胆汁不足的药材。李时珍本草纲目论熊胆曰“退热清心，平肝明目，去翳杀蛲虫”。在夏季，广大人民预防中暑霍乱最喜欢服用“万应锭”，里边就有熊胆的成分。
    蛤蟆：最常见的一种动物，在东北产的用腹内的油，药名为蛤蟆油，是治疗神经衰弱的滋补药材。在华东华北一带所产的，用眉棱分泌的白浆汁、药名叫蟾酥，是治疗外科疾病的主要药品，止痛消炎的效用显著，近代临床证明还能治疗心脏衰弱症，在治疗咽喉病的特效药“六神丸”中，就有蟾酥成分。
    以上两种药材，在医疗事业上需要量很大，生产较容易，要大力发展。
    蝎子：药名叫全蝎，也叫全虫，有很大的医疗效用，李时珍说可治“小儿惊痫风搐，大人痎疟耳聋、疝气、诸风疮、女人带下阴脱”。近代发明是治疗麻疯，大骨节病等的有效药，凡是治疗惊癎风邪等病的成药，大部需用蝎子配制，目前用蝎子制造的成药，计有三十六种，现因野生产量不足，部分地区在研究人工饲养。
    蕲蛇：又名白花蛇，产在南方一带深山中，主要用途是通治诸风，如大人中风，神经麻痹，口眼歪斜，半身不遂，骨节疼痛，以及麻木不仁等疾病，在配制中成药“回生再造丸”，“大活络丹”及各种治疗风湿药酒中，都是不可少的药品。
    其他动物药材的医疗作用也很大，比如治疗感寒解表用的蝉蜕，软化坚结的鳖甲，解热通经络的蚯蚓，温热滋补药鹿茸，鹿肾，海狗肾，滋阴益血的龟板，利肺定喘的蛤蚧，生肌明目的珍珠，镇静安神的玳瑁，惊痫风湿药蜈蚣，姜蚕等。
