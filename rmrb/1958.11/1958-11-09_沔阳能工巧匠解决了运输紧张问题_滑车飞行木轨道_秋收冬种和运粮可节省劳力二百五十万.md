Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 8th. Nearly 90,000 cadres and people in Mianyang County, Hubei Province, after half a month of hard work, have basically achieved the trolley-on-wooden-track system throughout the county. As of the end of October, more than 2,000 li of light wooden tracks have been laid and nearly 3,000 wooden trolleys have been made. Wooden track trolleys are accessible between all dikes and embankments and on major roads throughout the county. The realization of wooden track trolley system not only fundamentally solves the current transportation tension in the county, but also greatly liberates labor. It is estimated that 2.5 million labor days can be saved in autumn harvesting, winter planting, and grain transportation.

Secretary takes the lead, relies on the masses, relies on its own efforts, and vigorously promotes local methods. This is the basic experience of Mianyang in achieving wooden track trolley system in a short period. County Party Secretary Xia Fuqing, based on the increasing transportation tasks, proposed the idea of using local methods to vigorously develop transportation, and selected the Shahu Commune, which had the worst conditions, to pilot the wooden track trolley system. Because the secretary personally took action and focused on demonstration, the masses were gradually mobilized. Although Shahu is sparsely populated and lacks wood, the masses actively contributed materials, and 150 li of wooden tracks and more than 100 trolleys were built in three days and nights. After the successful pilot project in Shahu, the enthusiasm of the masses throughout the county was high, and they voluntarily contributed more than 1.949 million pieces of materials, which solved various difficulties such as wood and tools, and created extremely favorable conditions for the rapid realization of the wooden track trolley system throughout the county.

The wooden tracks and trolleys in Mianyang were all made by cadres and the masses themselves. In order to reduce frictional resistance, the masses nailed bamboo strips to the wooden tracks. The trolley wheels are also made of wood, and some have been fitted with ball bearings. Each trolley can carry 800 jin, and ordinary people can push it. This kind of trolley is seven times more efficient than carrying by shoulder, and one to two times more efficient than handcarts, and can also be used for transportation in rainy weather.

Jingzhou Special District of Hubei Province has decided to promote wooden track trolley transportation on a large scale throughout the region. (Attached picture)

    沔阳能工巧匠解决了运输紧张问题
    滑车飞行木轨道
    秋收冬种和运粮可节省劳力二百五十万
    新华社武汉8日电  湖北省沔阳县近九万多名干部和群众，经过半个月的苦战，基本上实现了全县木轨滑车化。到十月底为止，全县已经铺成轻便木轨道两千里，制成木滑车近三千辆。全县堤垸之间和大道干路上都通木轨滑车。木轨滑车化的实现，不仅基本上解决了全县当前运输紧张的问题，并且大大解放了劳动力。据估计，在秋收冬播和运粮工作中，全县可以节省二百五十万个劳动力。
    书记挂帅，依靠群众，自力更生，大搞土办法，这就是沔阳在短期内实现木轨滑车化的基本经验。县委书记夏甫庆根据运输任务越来越大的情况，提出了采用土办法大办交通的意见，并且选择了条件最差的沙湖公社试办木轨滑车。由于书记亲自动手，重点示范，群众逐渐发动起来。尽管沙湖地广人稀，木料最缺，但是群众纷纷献料，三昼夜就铺成木轨道一百五十里，制成滑车一百多辆。沙湖试办成功后，全县群众情绪高涨，自动献料达一百九十四万九千多件，解决了木料、工具等种种困难，为全县迅速实现木轨滑车化创造了极为有利的条件。
    沔阳木轨道和木轨车，全部是由干部和群众动手做成的。为了减少摩擦阻力，群众在木轨上钉上竹条。滑车车轮也是木制，一部分已装上滚珠轴承。每辆能载重八百斤，一般人都能推动。这种滑车比肩挑的工效提高七倍，比手推车也提高一两倍，而且雨天也能运输。
    湖北省荆州专区已决定在全区大量推广木轨滑车运输。（附图片）
