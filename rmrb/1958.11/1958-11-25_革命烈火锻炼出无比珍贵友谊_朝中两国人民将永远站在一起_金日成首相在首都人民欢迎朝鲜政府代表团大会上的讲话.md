Esteemed Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai, Esteemed Comrade Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen, Dear Comrades and Friends:

Our government delegation is extremely pleased to be able to meet you, our closest friends and comrades-in-arms, in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China.

For the past two or three days, we have been warmly welcomed and meticulously cared for by the leaders of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, which has kept us constantly moved and excited.

Today, you are holding such a grand rally to welcome us again. Your sincere reception is an expression of the warm friendship of the Chinese people towards the Korean people, which deeply touches us.

I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Korean people, to extend our heartfelt and fraternal greetings to you and, through you, to all the Chinese people.

 朝中友谊在革命斗争烈火中更加巩固和发展
The Friendship Between Korea and China is Further Consolidated and Developed in the Flames of Revolutionary Struggle

There is a proletarian internationalist relationship of friendly cooperation between the peoples of Korea and China. The friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China have been formed through long-term common struggles and have been consolidated and developed in the flames of revolutionary struggle.

Our two peoples have long been subjected to oppression by foreign imperialists.

In order to oppose the imperialists who extended their clutches into our two countries, the peoples of Korea and China fought side by side and formed an unbreakable relationship of comrades-in-arms through this struggle.

The establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China has brought the friendly and cooperative relations between our two peoples into a new stage and developed them in an all-round way, blossoming everywhere.

Both of our countries are members of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and are fraternal countries that help and support each other in the common struggle for peace and socialism.

Our common struggle against the armed aggression of US imperialism has demonstrated the invincible power of the friendly unity between the peoples of Korea and China.

The great movement of the Chinese people to resist US aggression and aid Korea is a manifestation of the fraternal Chinese people's love for our people and has become a model of proletarian internationalism. Your internationalist fighters, sent directly to the front lines in Korea, fought for the Korean people and dedicated everything they had.

The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier Huang Jiguang blocked the enemy's gun muzzles with his chest, thereby ensuring the victory of the battle, and martyr Luo Shengjiao sacrificed his life to save a Korean child.

All the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, like the hero Huang Jiguang, displayed fearless heroism in battle, and like the martyr Luo Shengjiao, loved and helped our people.

The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, educated by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, displayed unparalleled heroism and sacrifice, repelled the enemy's armed invasion of our country, and thus established great merits in safeguarding peace in Asia. The great achievements established by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Korean War will be evergreen along with the beautiful mountains and rivers of Korea and will shine forever in the history of the people's liberation struggle throughout the world.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has returned to its motherland after leaving behind great achievements in Korea. The men and women, old and young, in Korea saw off the volunteer army warriors with infinite reluctance.

The Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army warriors established an unbreakable deep friendship through the common struggle of sharing life and death and weal and woe, and further consolidated and developed the traditional friendship and unity between the Korean people and the Chinese people.

During the war and after the war, all the Chinese people, together with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, gave the Korean people tremendous assistance materially and spiritually.

During the difficult times of the war, you sent our people food and clothing. You nurtured many of our war orphans as if they were your own flesh and blood.

In the post-war period, the Government of the People's Republic of China provided huge amounts of free aid in order to restore and develop our people's economy, which had been destroyed.

Your sincere assistance reduced the suffering of our people in the difficult environment of the war and made a great contribution to the restoration and development of our people's economy after the war.

For this assistance, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and all the Chinese people on behalf of the Korean people.

Today, our two peoples are closely united, cooperating with each other, victoriously building socialism, and bravely advancing towards the ideal of mankind—communism.

In terms of socialist construction, the economic and cultural cooperation between Korea and China is constantly developing. This cooperation has made a great contribution to promoting the socialist construction of our two countries and strengthening the friendship and unity between our peoples.

In February of this year, the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, visited our country, further strengthening the traditional friendship between our two peoples and greatly encouraging the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the construction of socialism.

The friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China plays a huge role in safeguarding lasting peace in Asia and the world.

Our two peoples, with their united strength, defeated US imperialism, which boasted of being the "strongest" in the world. This proved to the world that US imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger that appears strong on the outside but is weak on the inside, greatly encouraging the liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples.

We are deeply convinced that the friendship and solidarity between our two peoples will be further consolidated and made even more unbreakable.

There is no doubt that our great friendship will make even greater contributions to the boundless prosperity of our two countries and to the victory of the great cause of peace and socialism.

No force can destroy the great friendship between the peoples of Korea and China, and no force can defeat the united strength of our two peoples.

朝鲜人民为中国人民的成就感到无限兴奋
The Korean People Are Infinitely Excited About the Achievements of the Chinese People

Dear Comrades!

The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people under its leadership have traversed a glorious road of revolutionary struggle for a long time and have achieved great victories in this struggle.

The victory of the Chinese revolution opened up a new era in the history of the Chinese people, who had suffered oppression for a long time. Moreover, it incomparably strengthened the power of the socialist camp and opened up a decisive and favorable situation for the liberation struggles of the peoples of colonies and dependencies.

Since its founding, the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, has achieved great successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

China has completed the socialist transformation and has also achieved decisive victories for socialism on the political and ideological front.

Today, the Chinese people are displaying great creativity in all aspects of socialist construction and are advancing at a flying speed of one day equaling twenty years.

Today, China's total industrial output value is expected to increase by more than 60% compared to last year. Your great task of producing more than 10 million tons of steel, twice the output of last year, is also being victoriously completed. There is no doubt that your struggle to catch up with Britain in the production of major industrial products such as steel will be realized not in fifteen years, but in a greatly shortened period.

China's rural areas are expected to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest of 400 million tons of grain and more than 3.5 million tons of cotton. China's wheat production has surpassed the United States and ranks second in the world.

This rate of growth in industrial and agricultural production is unprecedented and amazes people around the world.

People's communes are being organized in many places, and communist ideas are further rising among the broad working people.

The international prestige of the People's Republic of China has been raised to an unprecedented level and plays a huge role in strengthening the power and unity of the socialist camp and in maintaining lasting peace in the world, especially in Asia.

The 650 million Chinese people with a long history and a splendid cultural tradition are today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, showing their true power to the world.

We are deeply convinced that this great force will build a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture on China's vast land, overwhelming all imperialist countries.

The Korean people are infinitely excited and greatly encouraged by the victories and achievements that their close friends, the Chinese people, have achieved in socialist construction.

We often learn from your valuable experience, and we will learn more through this visit. This will greatly help our socialist construction.

朝鲜人民跨上千里马沿着社会主义大道飞奔
The Korean People Ride the Chollima and Race Along the Socialist Road

Under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, our people, in the most difficult environment after the war, completed the task of rebuilding the destroyed people's economy and are currently achieving great successes in socialist construction.

Thanks to the creative enthusiasm and selfless labor of our working people, our unprecedented first Five-Year Plan is being successfully implemented.

This year, industrial production will increase to more than 3.5 times that of 1949, more than 5.5 times that of 1953 when the armistice was signed; and in agriculture, an unprecedented bumper harvest has been achieved this year.

Our cities and rural areas have completed the socialist transformation and completely eliminated all exploitation systems. In terms of people's lives, we have completely healed the serious wounds of war.

A great upsurge has been launched in our socialist construction, and all the people have mounted the Chollima and are racing along the socialist road.

Not long ago, our Party, based on the achievements already made, put forward a magnificent long-term plan to realize the technical transformation of the people's economy and the cultural revolution, to develop industry and agriculture more rapidly, and to turn our country into a developed socialist industrial country in the next six or seven years.

The long-term plan put forward by our Party has aroused even greater revolutionary enthusiasm among the working people.

In all factories and enterprises, a mass innovation movement is being carried out to increase labor productivity by two to three times, including the mechanization of production processes, the promotion of advanced production experience, and the rational organization of labor.

The peasants are launching a labor upsurge to realize the tasks of water conservancy, electrification, and mechanization put forward by our Party. Within two or three years, we will realize irrigation systems on all cultivated land except for steep slopes.

We will realize rural electrification within one or two years, and it is possible to realize the overall mechanization of agriculture within four or five years.

Therefore, our working people are determined to complete the first Five-Year Plan one and a half to two years ahead of schedule; and for the long-term plan put forward by our Party, they are determined to realize it not in six or seven years, but in four or five years. We believe that our working people will definitely be able to realize their determination.
 和平与社会主义力量压倒战争与帝国主义势力
The Forces of Peace and Socialism Overwhelm the Forces of War and Imperialism

Dear Comrades and Friends!

Today, we are living in a favorable situation where the forces of peace and socialism have an absolute advantage over the forces of war and imperialism. The great Soviet Union is developing at a high speed in all aspects of economy, science, and technology, and is gradually beginning to overwhelm the United States. The Soviet Union's three satellites in the sky have proved to the world that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in a series of important sciences and technologies. Not long ago, the Soviet Union announced a magnificent new long-term plan for communist construction that will be submitted to the 21st Congress of the CPSU for discussion. It is not only a program of struggle for the Soviet people's communist construction, but it will also further encourage the people all over the world who are fighting for peace and socialism.

All the people's democratic countries are achieving greater success in the cause of building socialism.

All the countries of the socialist camp are closely united around the Soviet Union under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and the power of the socialist camp has been strengthened unprecedentedly. This is the firmest guarantee for the victory of peace and socialism.

The international reactionaries and their running dogs, the revisionists, have done everything possible and are continuing to carry out conspiracies in order to undermine the unity of the socialist camp. However, these conspiracies of theirs have suffered a series of failures. Historical experience has proved that in this world, no force can undermine the unity of the socialist camp. Whoever tries to undermine it will certainly suffer the same failures as in the past.

Tens of millions of people in Asia and Africa have been liberated from imperialist oppression and have won national independence. They are fighting for peace together with the socialist countries

Today, the situation in the East has undergone fundamental changes. The old East, which was wantonly oppressed and plundered by the imperialists, has become a thing of the past forever. The great Chinese people and the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Mongolia are confidently marching towards socialism and communism. Colonialism has been almost completely eliminated in Asia; the forces of peace-loving and anti-imperialism are growing rapidly.

美帝国主义不接受教训一定会被埋葬掉
US Imperialism Will Certainly Be Buried If It Does Not Learn Its Lesson

Now is the time when the imperialists must face up to the great power of the Eastern people that has emerged and is growing. The imperialists should not forget that they suffered military defeat for the first time in their history due to the strength of the Korean and Chinese people united together.

However, the imperialist aggressors headed by the United States are unwilling to face up to the changed situation, let alone learn the lessons they should have learned from their shameful failures.

US imperialism is colluding with the human garbage that has been spurned by the people, such as Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Ngo Dinh Diem, in a vain attempt to save their dying fate. It is also attempting to revive Japanese militarism and turn Japan into a US base of aggression in the Far East. All of this is simply like grasping at a straw when falling into the water, trying to prolong their lives.

The peace-loving people of Korea and China have resolutely fought and are still fighting against the aggressive policies of US imperialism.

Since the Korean armistice, Korea and China have made unremitting efforts to turn the armistice into a consolidated peace and to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

Based on the joint statement of the governments of Korea and China on February 19, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has completely withdrawn from Korea.

This measure once again proves the sincere efforts of the Chinese people to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to ease the tense situation in the Far East.

However, US imperialism has responded to the efforts of the people of Korea and China for peace by continuing to occupy South Korea, transporting in atomic weapons and missiles, and carrying out even more blatant war provocations. This further exposes its aggressive policies.

It is precisely US imperialism that occupies the southern half of our country, plunging the South Korean people into a living hell of hunger and poverty, and obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea. All the national misfortunes and sufferings that the Korean people are suffering today are rooted in the fact that US imperialism occupies South Korea. The United States has no excuse to legitimize its military occupation of South Korea, and they should withdraw from South Korea.

US imperialism has recently carried out serious provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area. Disregarding the repeated serious warnings of the Chinese people, the US aggressors continue to interfere in Taiwan, interfere in China's internal affairs, and provoke the People's Republic of China.

The foolish provocative acts of US imperialism against the Chinese people seriously threaten the security of the Far East and world peace.

If US imperialism does not accept the lessons of its repeated failures in its aggressive policies and the disastrous defeat in the Korean War, and disregards the serious warnings of the Chinese people and the denunciation of the people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people, and dares to expand its provocations, then, in the final analysis, it will certainly be buried.

In the common struggle against the common enemy, the Korean people, who are closely linked with the Chinese people, will always stand firmly on the side of the Chinese people in the struggle against US imperialist aggression and in defense of peace.

The Korean people believe in the correctness of their great cause and have received the active Support and assistance from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people of all other socialist countries. We will firmly defend the peace line of Korea and will definitely achieve final victory in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of our motherland.

In the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the construction of socialism, the friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China is invaluable. Our people have experienced the invincible vitality of the friendship and unity with the Chinese people through desperate struggles. In the future, we will continue to contribute all our strength to strengthening the traditional friendship and mutual cooperation between the peoples of Korea and China. The Korean people will always be comrades-in-arms with the Chinese people, sharing weal and woe.
　
Long live the great Chinese people!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party and the government of the People's Republic of China!

Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China!

Long live the invincible unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace! (The main and sub-headings were added by our editor.)

    革命烈火锻炼出无比珍贵友谊  朝中两国人民将永远站在一起
    金日成首相在首都人民欢迎朝鲜政府代表团大会上的讲话尊敬的周恩来总理同志，尊敬的北京市长彭真同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我们政府代表团能在中华人民共和国的首都北京和我们最亲密的朋友和战友——你们见面，感到万分高兴。
    两三天来，我们受到了中华人民共和国政府领导人员和中国人民的热烈欢迎和无微不至的款待，使我们一直感到无比激动和兴奋。
    今天你们又举行这样盛大的集会欢迎我们。你们这样诚挚的接待，是中国人民对朝鲜人民的热烈友情的表示，深深地感动了我们。
    我趁此机会以朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府以及朝鲜人民的名义，向你们并通过你们向全体中国人民衷心地致以热烈的兄弟般的问候。
    朝中友谊在革命斗争烈火中更加巩固和发展
    朝中两国人民之间有着无产阶级国际主义的友好合作关系。朝中两国人民之间的友谊和团结，是通过历来的长期共同斗争而形成的，并且在革命斗争的烈火中得到巩固和发展。
    我们两国人民长期以来就受到外来帝国主义者的压迫。
    为了反对把魔掌伸进我们两国的帝国主义者，朝中两国人民并肩进行了战斗，并且通过这种战斗结成了牢不可破的战友关系。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的成立，使我们两国人民的友好合作关系进入了新的阶段，并且全面地发展起来，遍地开花。
    我们两国都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的成员，是在为和平和社会主义的共同斗争中，互相帮助和支援的兄弟国家。
    我们反对美帝国主义武装侵略的共同斗争，显示了朝中两国人民友好团结的不可战胜的威力。
    中国人民伟大的抗美援朝运动，是兄弟般的中国人民热爱我国人民的表现，并且已经成为无产阶级国际主义的榜样。你们直接派赴朝鲜前线的国际主义战士，为朝鲜人民进行了战斗，献出了自己的一切。
    中国人民志愿军英雄黄继光，以自己的胸膛挡住了敌人的枪眼，从而保证了战斗的胜利，罗盛教烈士为了拯救朝鲜儿童而献出了自己的生命。
    中国人民志愿军全体官兵像黄继光英雄一样，在战斗中发挥了大无畏的英雄气概，像罗盛教烈士一样热爱和帮助我国人民。
    中国共产党和毛泽东主席教育出来的中国人民志愿军官兵，发挥了无比的英雄气概和牺牲精神，击退了敌人对我们祖国的武装侵犯，从而为维护亚洲和平建立了伟大的功勋。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战争中建立的伟大功绩，将和朝鲜的美丽山河一起万古常青，将在全世界人民解放斗争的历史上永放光彩。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜留下了丰功伟绩而回到自己的祖国了。朝鲜的男女老少都以无限惜别之情，欢送志愿军勇士。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军勇士之间，通过同生死、共甘苦的共同斗争，建立了牢不可破的深情厚谊，进一步巩固和发展了朝鲜人民和中国人民的传统友谊和团结。
    在战时和战后全体中国人民同中国人民志愿军一道，从物质上和精神上给予了朝鲜人民莫大的援助。
    在战争的困难时期，你们给我们人民送来了吃的和穿的。你们像对待自己的亲骨肉一样，抚育了我们许多战灾孤儿。
    战后时期，中华人民共和国政府为了恢复和发展遭到破坏的我国人民经济，提供了巨大的无偿援助。
    你们真诚的援助，在战争的困难环境里，减少了我国人民的痛苦，并且对我国战后人民经济的恢复和发展，作出了极大的贡献。
    对于这种援助，我以朝鲜人民的名义，向中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和全体中国人民表示深深的感谢。
    今天，我们两国人民，紧密团结，互助合作，胜利地建设社会主义，向着人类的理想——共产主义奋勇前进。
    在社会主义建设方面，朝中两国的经济和文化合作，正在不断地发展。这些合作，对促进我们两国的社会主义建设和加强我们人民之间的友谊和团结，作出了巨大的贡献。
    今年2月，以周恩来总理为首的中华人民共和国政府代表团访问我国，进一步加强了我们两国人民的传统友谊，大大鼓舞了朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一和建设社会主义的斗争。
    朝中两国人民的友谊和团结，在保卫亚洲和世界持久和平方面起着巨大的作用。
    我们两国人民，以自己的团结力量，战胜了自己吹嘘为世界“最强”的美帝国主义。向全世界证明了毛泽东同志所说的：美帝国主义只不过是一个外强中干的纸老虎；大大鼓舞了被压迫人民的解放斗争。
    我们深信，我们两国人民的友谊和团结，将会更加巩固，更加牢不可破。
    毫无疑问，我们的伟大友谊，将会对我们两国的无限繁荣，对和平和社会主义伟大事业的胜利，作出更加重大的贡献。
    任何力量也破坏不了朝中两国人民的伟大友谊，任何力量也战胜不了我们两国人民的团结力量。
    朝鲜人民为中国人民的成就感到无限兴奋
    亲爱的同志们！
    中国共产党和它领导的中国人民，长期以来走过了光荣的革命斗争道路，并在这一斗争中取得了伟大的胜利。
    中国革命的胜利，在长期遭受压迫的中国人民的历史上，开辟了新的时代。不仅如此，而且无可比拟地进一步加强了社会主义阵营的威力，对殖民地附属国人民的解放斗争，打开了具有决定意义的有利局面。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，中国人民在共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中获得了巨大的成就。
    中国已经完成了社会主义改造，在政治思想战线上也取得了社会主义的决定性胜利。
    今天，中国人民正在社会主义建设的各个方面发挥伟大的创造性，以一天等于二十年的飞跃速度前进。
    今天中国的工业总产值，预计将比去年增长60％以上。你们生产二倍于去年产量的一千多万吨钢的伟大任务，也正在胜利完成。毫无疑问，你们在钢铁等主要工业产品生产方面赶上英国的斗争任务，将不是十五年，而是会在大为缩短的期间内实现。
    中国农村预计将获得生产四亿吨粮食和三百五十多万吨棉花的空前大丰收。中国的小麦生产已经超过美国而占世界第二位。
    工业和农业生产方面的这种增长速度，是史无前例的，它使世界上的人们感到惊讶。
    许多地方正在组织人民公社，共产主义思想正在广大的劳动人民中进一步高涨。
    中华人民共和国的国际威望已经空前提高，在加强社会主义阵营的威力和统一，在维持世界特别是亚洲持久和平方面起着巨大的作用。
    具有悠久的历史和灿烂的文化传统的六亿五千万中国人民，今天在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，正向全世界显示他们的真正威力。
    我们深信，这种伟大的力量，将会在中国辽阔的土地上建立一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，压倒一切帝国主义国家。
    朝鲜人民为自己亲密的朋友——中国人民在社会主义建设中所获得的胜利和成就，感到无限兴奋，并且受到很大的鼓舞。
    我们经常学习你们的宝贵经验，通过这次的访问还会学到更多的东西。这将大大的有助于我国的社会主义建设。
    朝鲜人民跨上千里马沿着社会主义大道飞奔
    在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，我国人民在战后最困难的环境里，完成了重建遭到破坏的人民经济的事业，目前正在社会主义建设中获得巨大的成就。
    由于我国劳动人民创造性的热情和忘我的劳动，我国史无前例的第一个五年计划，正在胜利地实行。
    今年，工业生产将增长到1949年的三点五倍以上。同1953年停战当时相比，增长到五点五倍以上；农业方面，今年获得了空前的大丰收。
    我国的城市和农村，已经完成了社会主义改造，完全消灭了一切剥削制度。在人民生活方面，我们已经完全医治了严重的战争创伤。
    我国的社会主义建设已经掀起了一个巨大的高潮，全体人民已经跨上千里马，沿着社会主义的大道飞奔。
    不久以前，我们党根据已经获得的成就，提出了一个宏伟的远景规划，要实现人民经济的技术改造和文化革命，更加迅速地发展工业和农业，使我国在最近六、七年内变成发达的社会主义工业国家。
    我们党提出的远景规划，唤起了劳动人民的更高的革命热情。
    在所有的工厂和企业，都在为提高劳动生产率二至三倍开展着包括生产工序机械化，推广先进生产经验及合理组织劳动力等内容的群众性革新运动。
    农民们在掀起一个劳动高潮，要实现我们党提出的水利化、电气化和机械化的任务。在二、三年内除了陡坡地之外，我们要在全部耕地面积上实现灌溉系统。
    我们要在一、二年内实现农村电气化，在四、五年内有可能实现农业全盘机械化。
    因此，我们的劳动人民决心提前一年半到两年完成第一个五年计划；对于我们党所提出的远景规划，也不是六、七年，而是决心要在四、五年内实现。我们相信，我国劳动人民一定能够实现自己的决心。和平与社会主义力量压倒战争与帝国主义势力
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    今天，我们是在和平与社会主义力量比战争与帝国主义势力占绝对优势的有利的形势下生活着。伟大的苏联正在经济、科学技术的各方面高速度发展着，并且逐渐开始压倒美国。苏联三个卫星上天，向全世界证实了苏联在一系列的重要科学技术上已经超过美国。不久以前，苏联公布了将要提交苏共第二十一次大会讨论的宏伟的新的共产主义建设远景规划。它不仅是苏联人民共产主义建设的斗争纲领，而且会更加鼓舞为和平和社会主义而奋斗的全世界的人民。
    所有的人民民主国家都正在建设社会主义的事业中取得更大的成就。
    所有的社会主义阵营国家，都在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，以苏联为中心紧紧地团结在一起，空前地加强了社会主义阵营的威力。这是和平和社会主义胜利的最坚定的保障。
    国际反动派及其走狗修正主义者，为了破坏社会主义阵营的统一，千方百计地进行了并且正在进行着阴谋活动。可是他们的这种阴谋活动遭到了一连串的失败。历史经验已经证明，在这个世界上，没有任何力量能够破坏社会主义阵营的统一。谁要企图破坏，谁就一定会遭到像过去一样的失败。
    千千万万的亚洲和非洲人民，已经从帝国主义压迫下获得了解放，争取了民族独立。他们同社会主义国家一道，为和平而进行着斗争。
    今天，东方的局势已经发生了根本的变化。帝国主义者肆意压迫和掠夺过的旧东方，已经永远成为过去了。伟大的中国人民和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、蒙古的人民，正满怀信心地向着社会主义和共产主义迈进。在亚洲几乎全部消灭了殖民地；反对帝国主义的爱好和平的力量，正在迅速增长。
    美帝国主义不接受教训一定会被埋葬掉
    现在应该是帝国主义者必须正视已经产生并且正在成长的东方人民的伟大力量的时候了。帝国主义不应该忘记，由于团结在一起的朝中两国人民的力量，它们在自己的历史上第一次遭到的军事上的失败。
    然而，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略者，不愿正视业已转变的局势，更不愿意从自己所遭到的可耻的失败里吸取应有的教训。
    美帝国主义纠合已被人民唾弃的蒋介石、李承晚和吴庭艳等人类垃圾，妄图挽救自己日暮途穷的命运。它还企图复活日本军国主义，把日本变为美国在远东的侵略基地。这一切，简直就等于落到水里还抓住一棵草，企图苟延残喘。
    热爱和平的朝中两国人民，为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策，坚决地进行过并且仍在进行斗争。
    朝鲜停战以后，为了使停战转入巩固的和平，和平解决朝鲜问题，朝中两国作了坚持不渝的努力。
    中国人民志愿军基于朝中两国政府2月19日的联合声明，已经全部撤出朝鲜。
    这一措施再一次证明了中国人民为促进和平解决朝鲜问题，为缓和远东紧张局势而作的真诚努力。
    但是，美帝国主义却用继续强占南朝鲜、运进原子武器和导弹、更加露骨地进行战争挑衅来回答朝中两国人民为和平而作的努力。这更加暴露了它的侵略政策。
    正是美帝国主义霸占着我国的南半部，使南朝鲜人民陷入饥饿和贫穷的活地狱，阻挠着朝鲜的和平统一。今天朝鲜人民身受的一切民族不幸和痛苦，根源就在于美帝国主义强占着南朝鲜。美国没有任何借口能使它的军队强占南朝鲜合法化，它们应当撤出南朝鲜。
    美帝国主义最近在台湾海峡地区进行了反对中国人民的严重的挑衅。美国侵略者竟然不顾中国人民的屡次严重警告，继续插足台湾，干涉中国的内政，向中华人民共和国进行挑衅。
    美帝国主义反对中国人民的愚蠢的挑衅行为，严重地威胁着远东的安全和世界和平。
    如果美帝国主义不接受自己的侵略政策屡次遭到失败和在朝鲜战争中遭到惨败的教训，不顾中国人民的严重警告和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民以及一切爱好和平人民的痛斥，胆敢扩大自己的挑衅，那末，归根结底，一定会被埋葬掉。
    在反对共同敌人的共同斗争中，同中国人民血肉相连的朝鲜人民，在反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫和平的斗争中，将永远坚定地站在中国人民这一边。
    朝鲜人民相信自己伟大事业的正确，并且得到了苏联、中华人民共和国和其它所有社会主义国家人民的积极支持和援助。我们一定会坚强地捍卫朝鲜的和平防线，并且在为自己祖国和平统一的斗争中，一定会取得最后胜利。
    在朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一和建设社会主义的斗争中，朝中两国人民的友谊和团结是无比珍贵的。我国人民通过殊死的斗争，体验到了同中国人民的友谊和团结的不可战胜的生命力。今后，我们将继续为加强朝中两国人民的传统友谊和互相合作而贡献一切力量。朝鲜人民将永远是和中国人民同甘苦、共患难的战友。
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府万岁！
    朝中两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的不可战胜的统一万岁！
    世界和平万岁！　（大题和小题都是本报编者加的）
