    The Hero Who Fought the Tiger Laughs About Paper Tigers
    By Our Reporter Jiang Qingzhao
    Cheng Mingyu, the commander of the "Second Class Combat Hero Company" who fiercely fought the American paper tiger in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, read the documents of "Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" with a very warm and excited feeling. He said: "Eight years ago, Chairman Mao wisely pointed out that American imperialism is a paper tiger, which strengthened our courage and confidence, and defeated the American aggressors together with the Korean people. Today, when we return to the motherland and face the continued occupation of our Taiwan by American imperialism, and the sending of planes and warships to carry out war provocations against our people, we will keep Chairman Mao's teachings in mind and will surely defeat the enemy and win victory."
    This hero who fought the tiger and his heroic company had competed with the American invading army's Seventh Division, known as the "ace," on the Korean battlefield. In a short period of three months, after three rounds, they eliminated more than 400 enemies and captured 12 alive, using the iron facts to prove that although the enemy is the "ace" of Wall Street bosses, they are not the opponents of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    Lieutenant Cheng Mingyu, with his rich combat experience and invincible heroic spirit, described to reporters a vivid image of the American paper tiger.
    "This paper tiger is indeed fierce on the surface, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws," he said. "It was only under our heavy blows that it revealed its true colors of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside."
    In the spring of 1953, we faced the American invading army's Seventh Division face to face. Relying on their superior steel, they bombarded the small hilltop position we were guarding with thousands of shells every day, madly and arrogantly, attempting to win with so-called "firepower superiority." But don't think it's really something great, it's actually very loose when it comes to actual combat.
    One night, in order to punish them, we used the strength of only thirty soldiers to capture the position defended by fifty-three of them in just over ten minutes, killing fifty of them on the spot and capturing three alive. These American young master soldiers who lost their lives were still wearing so-called "bulletproof" "nylon flak jackets"!
    Lieutenant Cheng Mingyu enthusiastically described the heroic spirit of our soldiers and the embarrassed appearance of the American devils.
    In a fierce battle for a hilltop, our soldier Luo Shunyu was suddenly surrounded by three American devils. These three guys, relying on their tall stature, thought they could easily catch our young soldier. Therefore, two devils stood by with guns, and one devil rushed to hug Luo Shunyu. The situation was extremely dangerous! But the people's soldier Luo Shunyu was not discouraged, he used his short stature to his advantage, suddenly butted his head, broke the big nose of the American soldier who was hugging him, and then kicked the enemy to the ground, seized the gun in his hand, and killed him. The other two American soldiers were stunned! They dared not shoot and fled for their lives. Luo Shunyu pounced on them like a tiger, one shot for each, and ended the lives of these two American young master soldiers.
    There are many such vivid examples. Cheng Mingyu himself had experienced it. That was in another night battle, when Cheng Mingyu and the soldiers stormed into the enemy's position, they encountered a fierce counterattack from the enemy. After Cheng Mingyu continuously eliminated more than a dozen American devils, his submachine gun broke and his grenades were used up. Just when he was very anxious, he suddenly discovered an American soldier aiming and shooting at him. What to do? "Use the false as the real, come up with an empty city scheme!" Cheng Mingyu immediately roared, raised the broken submachine gun, and rushed towards the enemy. The American soldier was frightened! He stood still, threw down his submachine gun, and obediently raised his hands, becoming a prisoner.
    Cheng Mingyu said humorously that in the same battle, they also saw the American invading army's "living martyrs" for the first time. At that time, the battle was over, and Cheng Mingyu and squad leader Chen Shouxin were searching along the traffic trench filled with enemy corpses. When they were counting the number of enemy corpses, they suddenly found a corpse moving. They shouted loudly, and this guy got up. Then two more "corpses" also got up. Their first action was to gesticulate on their necks, asking not to be beheaded, and the second action was to reach out for something to eat.... It was truly an ugly sight!
    Cheng Mingyu said: "That's not enough! The story of our company's new soldier Jiang Shengnian capturing American prisoners is even more interesting." He was fighting the American invading army for the first time and wanted to capture an American devil alive to see if it was really a paper tiger! As soon as the battle started, he bravely rushed to the enemy's position and blew up a large bunker, but there were still enemies inside who were not dead. Jiang Shengnian held a grenade and shouted in English, "Lay down your arms and you will not be killed!" After shouting for a long time, the enemy did not come out. This made him very angry. He threw two grenades at the bunker entrance in a row. Strangely, this solved the problem immediately. Two rifles and a pistol were thrown out of the bunker. Then three American devils walked out with their hands raised, one of whom was an officer. Jiang Shengnian handed these three prisoners over to the wounded comrades to guard, and said heroically, "Don't let these guys run away, I'm going to catch a few more!"
    After telling me the above vivid stories, Lieutenant Cheng Mingyu said: "To be honest, when we went abroad to fight, we heard that the American imperialist invading army had planes and cannons, and what modernization, we were not really sure of it in our hearts. But at that time, our great leader Chairman Mao wisely pointed out that American imperialism is a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and our Chinese and Korean people will surely defeat it. Chairman Mao's words penetrated into the hearts of every one of our soldiers and became a huge force guiding and encouraging us to fight bravely. Therefore, every one of our soldiers deeply realized that the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea was the victory of Chairman Mao's great thought, and we are determined to better study Chairman Mao's philosophical and military thoughts and forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao."

    打虎英雄笑谈纸老虎
    本报记者  姜庆肇
    在中国人民志愿军代表团里，痛打过美国纸老虎的“二级战斗英雄连”指挥员程明玉，怀着十分亲切和激奋的心情，阅读着“毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文献。他说：“八年前，毛主席就英明地指出了美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，增强了我们的勇气和信心，同朝鲜人民一道打败了美国侵略军。今天，当我们回到祖国，又面对着美帝国主义继续霸占我们的台湾，并且派飞机和军舰向我国人民进行战争挑衅的时候，我们牢记毛主席的教导，就一定能够打败敌人，取得胜利。”
    这位打虎英雄和他的英雄连队，在朝鲜战场上是同号称“王牌”的美国侵略军第七师较量过的，在短短三个月的时间里，经过三个回合，就消灭敌人四百多名，活捉了十二名，用铁的事实证明敌人虽然是华尔街老板的“王牌”，却不是中国人民志愿军的对手。
    程明玉中尉以他那丰富的战斗经历，无敌的英雄气概，向记者描述了一幅活生生的美国纸老虎的形象。
    “这个纸老虎，在表面上的确是凶恶的，张牙舞爪的。”他说：“只是在我们沉重打击下，它才暴露出外强中干的原形。”
    1953年春天，我们同美国侵略军第七师面对面地相峙着。它们依仗钢铁多，每天向我们守卫的一座小山头阵地上炮击成千发炮弹，疯狂不可一世，企图以所谓“炮火优势”制胜。可是，你别以为它真的有什么了不起，真的交起手来却很稀松。
    一天晚上，我们为了惩罚它一下，仅仅十几分钟，就以三十个战士的力量，攻下它五十三个人防守的阵地，当场打死它五十名，活捉了三名。这些丧了命的美国少爷兵身上，还都穿着所谓“刀枪不入”的“尼龙避弹衣”呢！
    程明玉中尉兴致勃勃地描述着我们战士的英雄气概和美国鬼子的狼狈相。
    在一次激烈的山头争夺战中，我们的战士罗舜玉突然被三个美国鬼子包围了。这三个家伙凭着个子高，满以为可以轻而易举地捉到我们这个年青的战士。因此，两个鬼子在一旁端着枪，一个鬼子抢先抱住了罗舜玉。处境是十二分危险的呀！可是人民战士罗舜玉毫不气馁，他利用自己个子矮的长处，猛然一头，就把抱着他的那个美国兵的大鼻子撞破了，接着又用脚踢倒了敌人，夺下他手里的枪，把他打死。另外两个美国兵吓呆了！他们不敢开枪，而自顾逃命。罗舜玉猛虎般地扑上去，一枪一个，又结果了这两个美国少爷兵。
    这样生动的事例是很多的。程明玉自己就经历过。那是在另一次夜间战斗中，当程明玉和战士们猛杀进敌人阵地的时候，碰上了凶猛反扑的敌人。程明玉在连续消灭十多个美国鬼子以后，冲锋枪打坏了，手榴弹也打光了。正在这十分焦急的时候，却突然发现一个美国兵在向他瞄准射击。怎么办呢？“以虚为实，来个空城计！”程明玉当即猛吼一声，端起了坏冲锋枪，冲向敌人。美国兵被吓昏了！他原地不动，扔下了冲锋枪，乖乖地举起双手，当了俘虏。
    程明玉幽默地说，在这同一次战斗中，他们还头一次看到了美国侵略军的“活烈士”。当时，战斗已经结束了，程明玉和六班长陈守信正顺着填满敌人尸体的交通壕边进行搜查工作。当他们正在点敌人尸体的数目时，却一下子发现有个尸体直动弹。他们猛喝一声，这家伙爬起来了。接着又有两个“尸体”也爬起来了。他们第一个动作就是用手在脖子上比划着要求不杀头，第二个动作就是伸手要东西吃……。真是丑态百出！
    程明玉说：“这还不够哩！我们连的新战士蒋胜年捉美国俘虏的故事就更有意思啦。”他头一次和美国侵略军打仗，就想活捉个美国鬼子看看，究竟是不是个纸老虎！战斗一打响，他勇敢地冲上敌人阵地，炸塌了一个大地堡，但是里面还有敌人没死。蒋胜年握着手榴弹，用英语喊着“缴枪不杀！”喊了半天，敌人却不出来。这可把他气坏了。他连续向地堡口扔去两颗手榴弹。奇怪，这一下子就解决问题了。地堡里扔出了两支步枪、一支手枪。接着三个美国鬼子都举着手走出来，当中还有一个是军官。蒋胜年把这三个俘虏交给负伤的战友看押，豪气冲天地说：“可别让这些家伙跑了，我还要去捉几个啦！”
    程明玉中尉在向我讲述了以上这些生动的事迹之后说：“说实话，早在我们出国作战的时候，听说美帝国主义侵略军又有飞机大炮，又有什么现代化，我们的心里确实还不大摸它的底。可是就在那个时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席就英明地指出了美帝国主义是一只外强中干的纸老虎，我们中朝人民一定能够打败它。毛主席的话，深入我们每个战士的心，成为指引和鼓舞着我们勇敢战斗的巨大力量。因此，我们每个战士都深刻地认识到抗美援朝的胜利就是毛主席伟大思想的胜利，我们决心更好地学习毛主席的哲学思想和军事思想，永远做毛主席的好战士。”
