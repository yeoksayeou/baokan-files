    Fiberglass Bicycle
    This bicycle made of fiberglass was trial-produced by the Tianjin Glass Factory. The main components of this bicycle are all made of fiberglass. Because fiberglass has high strength, light weight, and strong resistance to general chemicals, this bicycle is light, durable, and does not rust. (Attached picture)

    玻璃钢自行车
    这辆用玻璃钢做的自行车，是天津市玻璃厂试制出来的。这辆车子全车的主要部件都是用玻璃钢做的。因为玻璃钢强度大，分量轻，对一般化学药品的抵抗力强，所以这种自行车轻便、耐用、不生锈。（附图片）
