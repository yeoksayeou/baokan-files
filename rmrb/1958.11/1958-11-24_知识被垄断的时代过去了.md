    The Era of Knowledge Monopoly is Over
    Chen Guoliang
    Wei Gao believes that there will still be geniuses in communist society, and there is no need to ask geniuses to do work they are not good at, otherwise the genius will be buried. His argument is not unpopular. During our labor in the foundry workshop in the summer, some people said: "Modeling is better than tempering, but tempering is still better than pulling a cart." Some people also said: "It would be a huge waste to have me, a college student, pull a cart for the rest of my life." They emphasize that some so-called "top" figures among the "geniuses" can only engage in mental labor, scientific research, and theory; as for physical labor? Let the working people do it! They simply want to continue to monopolize knowledge and are afraid that the working people will master scientific knowledge.
    This reminds people of the "fool the people policy" of all exploiting classes in the past. Only the exploiting classes were afraid of the working people mastering knowledge, and only they put forward the fallacy of "the people can be made to follow, but not to know." They were afraid that once the workers and peasants mastered knowledge and understood the roots of the unreasonableness of the old society, they would rise up and overthrow their rule. It is shocking that in socialist today, among the college students in New China, some people are actually advocating this "fool the people policy," fearing the cultural liberation of the working people. It is not difficult to see what kind of thinking is at play.
    Those who think that the working people should not master science and culture should listen to the voices of the working people. Take Dasi Gezhuang in Xushui County as an example. In the past, only three people in the whole village of more than 700 people had studied "The Four Books" for a few days. In the past, farmers were illiterate, and they had to run several miles to find someone to write letters for them. Every Spring Festival, they had to run a long way to beg those "knowledgeable masters" to write Spring Festival couplets. They said painfully: "At that time, we were really blind, and we had nowhere to complain." For example, in the past, because the working people did not have scientific knowledge, they were tricked by the feudal rulers with superstitions of seeking gods and worshiping Buddha, and they regarded incense ash as elixir. My father suffered from lung disease and had no money for treatment, so he ate this kind of "elixir" and died without being cured. The working people are eagerly demanding cultural liberation. Every student from a worker or peasant background can recall what our parents said to us when we went to school. I clearly remember my parents saying to me: "Son! You must study hard. We don't even have enough to eat, but we still let you go to school, just so you won't be bullied anymore." And during my primary school years, I was ridiculed by the landlord masters, who used sarcasm to attack a child who was less than ten years old, saying, "Poverty is destined, it's useless for you to study for a few more years."
    Looking back on the past, it is very jarring to hear some classmates are afraid of the working people mastering knowledge. These people always want to put themselves in a superior position, fearing that after the working people master knowledge, they will lose the "good name" of intellectuals. Some people, in order to cover up their shameful idea of not letting the working people master knowledge, find all kinds of strange reasons to prove that the workers and peasants only need to have general knowledge to engage in physical labor. They feel uncomfortable and look down on workers and peasants running "Red and Expert Universities." This kind of thinking of "only allowing the working people to popularize, but not allowing the working people to improve" is essentially the exploiting class ideology of not letting the working people culturally liberate themselves, and this kind of thinking makes them short-sighted and unable to see that in the future communist society, production will be greatly developed, and electrification and atomic energy will be things used in daily life. What they refer to as "cutting-edge" is only the "general knowledge" of the workers and peasants.
    Today, the era of wanting to monopolize scientific knowledge and let the working people be manipulated by intellectuals has passed.

### 知识被垄断的时代过去了

    知识被垄断的时代过去了
    陈国梁
    魏高认为共产主义社会仍然会有天才，没有必要叫天才去做他不擅长的工作，否则就埋没了天才。他的这种论调并不是曲高和寡的。暑期我们在铸工车间劳动时就有人说：“造型工比退火好，但退火比拉大车还是好些。”也有人说：“要我大学生拉一辈子大车是天大的浪费。”他们强调，一些所谓“天才”中的“拔尖”人物就只能搞脑力劳动，搞科学研究，搞理论；体力劳动么？还是让劳动人民去搞吧！他们无非是想继续把知识垄断起来，而害怕劳动人民掌握了科学知识。
    这使人想起过去一切剥削阶级的“愚民政策”。只有剥削阶级才害怕劳动人民掌握知识，才提出什么“民可使由之，不可使知之”的谬论。他们害怕工农群众一旦掌握了知识，懂得了旧社会的不合理的根源，就起而推翻他们的统治。令人吃惊的是，在社会主义的今天，在新中国的大学生中，居然有人也在主张这种“愚民政策”，害怕劳动人民文化翻身，这就不难看出，究竟是什么思想在作祟了。
    认为劳动人民不要掌握科学文化的人，最好是去听听劳动人民的呼声。举徐水大寺各庄为例，全村七百多口人，过去只有三个人念过几天“四书”。过去农民一字不识，写信得跑几里地找人代写。每逢春节，写副春联也要跑好远央求那些“知识老爷们”。他们痛苦地说：“那时真是睁眼瞎子，有苦无处说。”又如过去由于劳动人民没有科学知识，就备受封建统治者用求神拜佛的迷信作弄，把香灰当作仙丹。我父亲得了肺病，无钱医治，也就是吃这种“仙丹”，不治而死的。劳动人民是迫切要求文化翻身的。每一个工农出身的同学，可以回想一下当我们上学时，我们的父母对我们说了些什么话。我清楚地记得我的父母对我说过：“儿呀！你要好好念书，我们连吃也不够，还是让你去念书，就是为了不再受气。”而我就在小学念书时期，也受尽了地主老爷们的嘲笑，他们用冷言冷语来打击一个不到十岁的孩子，说什么“穷是命里注定的，你再多念几年书也白搭”。
    回想过去，听到有些同学害怕劳动人民掌握知识，觉得非常刺耳。这些人总想把自己放在高人一等的地位，怕劳动人民掌握了知识后，使自己丧失了知识分子的“美名”。有的人为掩盖他们不让劳动人民掌握知识的可耻思想，就找各种奇怪理由来证明，说什么工农从事体力劳动只要有一般知识就行了。听到工农办“红专大学”就不舒服，就瞧不起。这种“只许工农普及，不许工农提高”的思想，实质上还是不让劳动人民文化翻身的剥削阶级思想，而这种思想使他们眼光短浅，看不到在将来的共产主义社会中生产极大的发展了，电气化、原子能已是日常生活中应用的东西，他们指的“尖端”也只不过是工农群众的“一般知识”罢了。
    今天，想垄断科学知识，让劳动人民听知识分子摆布的时代已过去了。
