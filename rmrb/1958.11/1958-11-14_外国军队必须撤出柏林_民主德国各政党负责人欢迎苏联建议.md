Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 13th. Leaders of various political parties and mass organizations in the German Democratic Republic warmly welcome the proposal by Soviet Premier Khrushchev regarding the status of Berlin.

    German Socialist Unity Party Central Committee Political Bureau member Matern said that the withdrawal of foreign troops from Berlin would help to normalize life in all of Berlin and "would be a major step towards guaranteeing peace for Germany and all of Europe."
    Chairman of the Free Democratic Party and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Loch, welcomed Khrushchev's proposal that the signatory powers of the Potsdam Agreement finally end the occupation regime in Berlin. He emphasized that the Potsdam Agreement has now become an empty promise due to the fascization of West Germany, the implementation of atomic armament, and the re-employment of former Nazis.
    President of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann, pointed out in a speech to voters in Leipzig that Khrushchev's remarks on the German question were a serious warning to new and old warmongers. Dieckmann pointed out that the Western countries and West German politicians have undermined the Potsdam Agreement, which is the main reason why the German people cannot live in peace and cannot achieve peaceful reunification.
    Chairman of the German Peace Committee and renowned scientist Professor Friedrich said that Berlin must no longer be a center of provocation and aggression.
    General Secretary of the Christian Democratic Union, Goetting, emphasized that the Western countries have abandoned their obligations under the Potsdam Agreement, and now only the occupation regime in Berlin remains. Goetting welcomed Khrushchev's proposal regarding the status of Berlin.
    Dr. Guenther Gereke, former Minister of the Interior of Lower Saxony in West Germany and now residing in the German Democratic Republic, welcomed Khrushchev's proposal regarding the status of Berlin. He hoped that this proposal would contribute to the solution of the German question.

    外国军队必须撤出柏林
    民主德国各政党负责人欢迎苏联建议
    新华社柏林13日电　民主德国各党派和群众团体的领导人，热烈欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于柏林地位问题的建议。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员马特恩说，外国军队撤出柏林将有助于使全柏林的生活正常化，并且“将是在走向保障德国和整个欧洲的和平方面跨出一大步”。
    自由民主党主席、民主德国副总理洛赫表示欢迎赫鲁晓夫提出的关于波茨坦协定签订国最后结束占领柏林的制度的建议。他强调指出，由于西德的法西斯化、实行原子武装并重新雇用前纳粹分子，波茨坦协定现在已经成了没有兑现的空话。
    民主德国人民议院主席团主席狄克曼在对来比锡选民发表演说时指出，赫鲁晓夫关于德国问题的谈话，是对新老战争贩子的一个严重警告。狄克曼指出，西方国家同西德政客破坏了波茨坦协定，这是德国人民不能安居乐业、不能获得和平统一的主要原因。
    德国和平委员会主席、著名科学家弗里德里希教授说，必须使柏林不再成为一个挑衅和侵略的中心。
    基督教民主联盟总书记戈丁强调指出，西方国家背弃了它们对波茨坦协定所承担的义务，现在仅仅剩下了占领柏林的制度。戈丁表示欢迎赫鲁晓夫关于柏林地位问题的建议。
    曾任西德的下萨克森州内政部长而现在居住在民主德国的根特·盖雷克博士欢迎赫鲁晓夫关于柏林地位问题的建议。他希望这个建议能有助于德国问题的解决。
