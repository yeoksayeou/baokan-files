Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, November 5th - The broad masses of military personnel and civilians on the Fujian Front are furiously condemning the grave crime of the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen for using poison gas shells to attack our army. They unanimously pointed out that this new military provocation by the Kuomintang army occurred after the Chiang-Dulles talks and the United States supplied the Kuomintang with a large amount of military supplies, and its nature is extremely serious. If the Kuomintang army dares to continue firing poison gas shells, the frontline troops will certainly give them severe punishment without any mercy.

    The artillery troops, who severely punished the enemy in the shelling of Jinmen, gathered beside their majestic cannons to denounce this new evil act by the US-Chiang clique. Zhu Xing, the artillery company commander who was awarded the Third Class Merit in the battle, said that on the day before our shelling on the 3rd, we had repeatedly notified our compatriots in Jinmen to take cover to avoid unnecessary casualties. However, the Jinmen Chiang troops fired US-made poison gas shells at us during the artillery battle. This inhumane crime is intolerable.

    The heroic frontline air force commanders and fighters were even more enraged by this evil act of the US-Chiang clique. Huan Shulin, Yang Yanfu and other pilots who participated in the air battle on October 10 and shot down three US-made Chiang aircraft said that we are waiting in battle readiness. If the enemy dares to use poison gas bombs again, we will definitely punish them severely. Zhang Qingsen, the squadron leader of a naval gunboat unit performing duties at sea, said that US imperialism used bacteriological weapons inhumanly in the Korean War in the past, and repeatedly fired poison gas shells at the positions of the Chinese and Korean armies. Now, it has supplied the Jinmen Chiang troops with poison gas shells to bombard our army. This consistent inhumane crime will surely be severely condemned by the people of the world. Neither the bacteriological weapons nor the poison gas weapons of US imperialism can scare the Chinese people. This new military provocation by US imperialism and the Kuomintang army cannot shake the Chinese people's firm will to liberate their own territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen and Matsu.

    The steelworkers of the Fuzhou General Machinery Factory held an angry rally early this morning next to the steelmaking furnace to protest the serious crimes of US imperialism and the Kuomintang army. The workers of this factory, which won the first place in the province's steel production during the first steelmaking high-yield week, are determined to produce more steel to smash the enemy's provocations. The broad masses of militiamen and farmers in the suburbs of Fuzhou, Xiamen and other places who are engaged in production and construction and practicing the skills of killing the enemy in the fields, construction sites and shooting ranges are determined to step up military training, step up production, and be ready to support the People's Liberation Army to severely punish the enemy at any time. Lin Zhongping, the deputy leader of the militia company of the Xiamen Front People's Commune, said: "The Kuomintang army used American poison gas shells to attack our compatriots. If the enemy stubbornly refuses to come to their senses, we will have to use artillery to wake them up. The people on the front will always guarantee their full support for the People's Liberation Army to severely punish the enemy." The employees of the Xiamen Glass Factory also signed letters to express their condolences to the soldiers who were injured by poison gas shells.

    The broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives who are studying the important document "Mao Zedong's Thesis that Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" believe that the use of American poison gas shells by the Jinmen Chiang army to attack our army does not indicate their strength. On the contrary, it shows that they are on their last leg.

    毒气弹是敌人穷途末路的信号弹
    福建前线军民怒斥金门蒋军对我使用毒气武器
    新华社福建前线5日电　福建前线广大军民愤怒谴责金门蒋军用毒气炮弹攻击我军的严重罪行。他们一致指出，国民党军队这一新的军事挑衅发生在蒋杜会谈和美国把大批军火物资供给国民党之后，性质是极其严重的。如果国民党军队胆敢继续施放毒气炮弹，前线部队定将毫不留情地给予严厉的惩罚。
    在炮击金门战斗中严重地惩罚过敌人的炮兵部队，在雄伟的大炮旁边集会申讨美蒋这一新的罪恶行为。在战斗中荣立三等功的炮兵连长朱兴说，我们在3日炮击前一天，曾几次通知金门军民同胞注意隐蔽，以避免可以避免的伤亡，然而金门蒋军却在炮战中向我施放美制毒气炮弹。这种违反人道的罪行，是不能容忍的。
    英雄的前线空军指战员们对美蒋这一罪恶行为更加怒不可遏。曾参加10月10日空战击落三架美制蒋机的飞行员桓树林、羊衍富等说，我们在严阵以待，如果敌人敢再施用毒气弹，我们就一定狠狠地予以惩罚。正在海上执行勤务的海军某炮舰部队中队长张庆森说，美帝国主义过去在朝鲜战场上曾灭绝人性地使用细菌武器，并且多次向中朝军队阵地施放毒气炮弹，现在又把毒气炮弹供给金门蒋军向我军轰击，这种一贯的违反人道主义的罪恶行为，必将受到全世界人民的严厉谴责。不管是美帝国主义的细菌武器还是毒气武器都吓不倒中国人民。美帝国主义和国民党军队这种新的军事挑衅，决不能动摇中国人民解放自己祖国领土台、澎、金、马的坚强意志。
    福州通用机器厂的炼钢工人今天一早在炼钢炉旁愤怒集会，抗议美帝国主义和国民党军队的严重罪行。这个在第一次炼钢高产周中抢得了全省钢产量第一的工厂的工人们，决心以生产更多的钢铁来粉碎敌人的挑衅。正在田间、工地、射击场上进行生产建设和练习杀敌本领的福州、厦门等地郊区广大民兵和农民，决心加紧练兵、加紧生产、随时准备支援解放军狠狠地惩罚敌人。厦门前线人民公社的民兵连副连长林忠平说：“国民党军队利用美国毒气炮弹攻击我同胞，如果敌人死不悔悟，我们只好用大炮来叫他们清醒。前线人民永远保证全力支援解放军严厉惩罚敌人。”厦门玻璃厂的职工还签名写信慰问受毒气炮弹伤害的战士。
    正在学习“毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”重要文件的广大归国华侨、侨眷认为，金门蒋军利用美国毒气弹攻击我军，并不表明他们强大，相反地表现他们日薄西山穷途末路。
