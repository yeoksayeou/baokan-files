    We Fight on the Forefront
    He Jiangping, Secretary of the General Branch of the CPC Hecuo Township
    Our Hecuo Township is the most forward position on Xiamen Island. Since the liberation of Xiamen in October 1949, we have been in intense struggle against the enemy. We hold guns in one hand to support the front lines and defend the coast; and we hold hoes in the other to engage in production and construction.

    We have long achieved universal armament on the front lines. Our male and female militia members, whether in winter or summer, cooperate with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to guard the coastline day and night. At the same time, they also help the PLA carry out political offensives against the enemy, using kites and other methods to send tens of thousands of propaganda materials to the enemy-occupied islands, conveying the rapid advancements of the motherland and the voices of peace to the Kuomintang (KMT) officers and soldiers.

    As soon as the artillery fires, the villagers, men and women, rush to the front, helping the soldiers to move shells, wipe shells, remove safety pins, and install fuses. Everyone becomes a soldier. If PLA soldiers are wounded, the masses immediately brave the smoke and flying shrapnel to rescue the wounded and send them to a safe place, taking care of them as if they were their own children or brothers. During breaks in the artillery battles, the masses help the soldiers build fortifications, and if the troops need stones to reinforce the fortifications, the masses immediately search everywhere. To ensure the smooth flow of the highway, the masses in each village divide sections to maintain the road. Once the transportation line is damaged by the enemy, they rush to repair it without the artillery stopping. The highway leading to the front is an unbreakable iron transportation line.

    In order to allow the soldiers more time to rest and recharge their batteries to punish the enemy, women organized laundry groups and water delivery teams. Women washed tens of thousands of clothes for the soldiers. The soldiers, afraid that the masses were too tired, were reluctant to give them their clothes to wash, so they asked the military leaders to issue an order, telling the soldiers to hand over their dirty clothes; some soldiers hid their clothes, so they went to the shelters to search for them, no matter where the soldiers put them, they would find them and take them to wash. They would not leave the front until they got the clothes. As soon as the artillery sounded, they began to prepare boiling water for the soldiers to drink. Some people, fearing that the soldiers would be hungry while fighting or building fortifications, often cooked sweet potato soup to send to the soldiers as snacks. In short, everyone actively does everything that is conducive to the victory of the struggle.

    While doing everything for the front, we also actively engage in production and construction. According to the characteristics of the situation, we adopted the method of dividing the whole into parts, decentralizing production, assigning special personnel for management, and contracting responsibilities for production. If the enemy does not fire, we work hard on production; if they fire a little, we work a little; if they fire a lot, we rest; if they fire on this side, we work on that side; if they fire on that side, we work on this side; if they fire during the day, we work at night; if they fire at night, we work during the day. We have universally dug air-raid shelters in the fields, and when the artillery fire gets close, we go into the air-raid shelters to rest and study. No matter how crazy the enemy is, our production has never stopped. If the crops are destroyed, we replant them.

    This year, the average yield of early rice in the township was 430 jin per mu, which is higher than the previous highest record; aquatic products such as fish and oysters have also increased by 30% to 50% respectively. In order to increase oyster production, 700,000 oyster stones were transplanted to the deep waters of the strait, creating a national record of 3,100 jin of oyster meat per mu this year. In terms of industry, we only had a few earthen kilns before, but now we have more than 20 factories such as power plants. The Party called on the whole people to make steel, and we also actively responded to this call, building furnaces, picking up shrapnel, and turning the shrapnel used by the enemy to kill people into good steel, to be made into tools for peaceful construction. Due to the gradual development of production, the lives of farmers have generally improved, and 80% of the farmers have caught up with the level of well-to-do middle peasants.

    October 9th was an unforgettable day when we established the People's Commune. Now, more than 30,000 farmers in our commune are struggling tirelessly to win greater victories and a greater harvest next year.

    After the failure of its military provocation conspiracy, U.S. imperialism is now attempting to create a "two Chinas" conspiracy. We once again warn U.S. imperialism not to provoke China. If it does not quickly withdraw its claws and continues to interfere in China's internal affairs, it will be crushed to pieces under the iron fists of the Chinese people.

    我们战斗在最前沿
    中共何厝乡总支书记　何江萍
    我们何厝乡是厦门岛上最前沿的地方。从1949年10月厦门解放，我们一直在紧张的对敌斗争中，我们一手拿枪，支援前线，保卫海防；一手拿锄头，生产建设。
    在前沿早已实现了全民武装。我们的男女民兵，不论冬天，或是夏天，配合解放军日夜守卫在海防线上。同时，还帮助解放军对敌人开展政治攻势，用风筝等各种办法，把成千上万的宣传品，送往敌占岛屿，把祖国一日千里的跃进形势，把保卫和平的声音，传给蒋军官兵。
    炮一打响，村上的男男女女群众，都往阵地跑，去帮助战士搬炮弹、擦炮弹、脱保险、上信管。大家都成了战士。解放军受了伤，群众立即冒着硝烟，在弹片纷飞中把伤员抢救下来，送到安全地方，像对待儿女兄弟一样照顾伤员。炮战间隙，群众便帮助战士构筑工事，部队需要石块加固工事，群众立即到处找寻。为了保证公路畅通，各村群众划分地段维护公路。运输线一被敌人打坏，炮没有停，就出动去抢修。通往前沿的公路，是一条打不断的钢铁运输线。
    为了让战士们有更多的时间休息，养精蓄锐惩罚敌人，妇女们组织了洗衣组，送水队。妇女为战士洗衣服数以万计。战士怕群众太累，不愿把衣服给她们洗，她们就请求部队首长下命令，叫战士们把脏衣服交出来；有些战士把衣服藏起来，她们就到掩蔽部里去找寻，不管战士们放在什么地方，都要把它找出来拿去洗，她们到了阵地，不拿到衣服是不走的。炮声一响，她们就开始准备开水给战士们喝，有些群众怕战士作战、修工事肚子饿，常常烧地瓜汤送去给战士当点心。总之，一切有利于斗争胜利的事，大家都积极干。
    在一切为前线的同时，我们也积极进行生产建设。我们根据形势的特点，采取化整为零，分散生产，专人管理，包干负责的方法进行生产。敌人不打炮，我们就猛干生产，它小打我们就小干，它大打我们就休息；它打这边我们就在那边干，它打那边我们就在这边干，它白天打我们晚上干，晚上打就白天干。在田头我们都普遍挖了防炮洞，炮打近了，就进防炮洞借以休息、学习。不管敌人如何疯狂，我们生产从没有停止。庄稼被毁坏，就再补种。
    今年全乡早稻平均亩产四百三十斤，比过去最高纪录还高；鱼蚝等水产也分别增长了30％到50％。为了提高海蚝产量，向海峡深水中移殖了七十万块蚝石，今年创造了亩产蚝肉三千一百斤的全国最高纪录。工业方面，以前我们只有几个土窑，现在我们已有发电厂等二十多个工厂。党号召全民炼钢铁，我们也积极响应了这个号召，建炉子，拣弹片，把敌人用来杀人的弹片，炼成好钢，做成和平建设的工具。由于生产逐年发展，农民生活都普遍提高了，有80％的农民已经赶上富裕中农的水平。
    10月9日，这是一个难忘的日子，我们成立了人民公社。现在我们全社三万多农民正为争取更大胜利和明年更大丰收不懈地斗争。
    美帝国主义在军事挑衅的阴谋破产后，现在又企图制造“两个中国”的阴谋，我们再一次警告美帝国主义，休得在太岁头上动土，在强大的中国人民面前，如不赶快缩回魔爪，继续干涉中国内政，就将在中国人民的铁拳下粉身碎骨。
