Six Hundred Million People Turn Into Steel
Ge Bizhou
    Which high mountain is without raging fire?
    Which village is not radiating light?
    Which sky is not glowing red?
    Which piece of ground is not shining bright?
    Bright enough to make the Yangtze River roll with silver,
    Bright enough to make the Yellow River churn with golden waves,
    There are tens of thousands of steel warriors,
    From the East Sea all the way to the Kunlun Mountains.
    Forging two precious swords,
    Radiating ten thousand rays of light:
    One is called the Sword of Peace,
    With a swing of the sword,
    High mountains and great rivers offer up grain;
    One is called the Demon-Subduing Sword,
    With a swing of the sword,
    Taiwan and Penghu see the sun.
    The New China is a great melting pot,
    Six hundred million people turn into steel.

    六亿人民尽成钢
    戈壁舟
    哪一座高山没有烈火？
    哪一个村庄不放光？
    哪一块天空没有烧红？
    哪一段地面不发亮？
    亮得长江银水滚，
    亮得黄河翻金浪，
    钢铁战士有万万，
    东海直到昆仑上。
    炼出两把宝剑来，
    放射着万道霞光：
    一把叫做和平剑，
    剑一挥，
    高山大河献出粮；
    一把叫做降魔剑，
    剑一挥，
    台湾澎湖出太阳。
    新中国是座大熔炉，
    六亿人民尽成钢。
