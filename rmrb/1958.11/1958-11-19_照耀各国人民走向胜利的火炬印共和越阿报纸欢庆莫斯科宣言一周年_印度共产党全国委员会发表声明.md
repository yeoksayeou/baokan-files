    A Torch Illuminating the People of All Countries Towards Victory: Indian Communist, Vietnamese, and Albanian Newspapers Celebrate the First Anniversary of the Moscow Declaration
  　Indian Communist Party National Committee Issues Statement
    The Socialist Camp is Becoming Stronger
    The Imperialist Camp is Falling Apart

    According to Xinhua News Agency: The Secretariat of the National Committee of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on November 13th regarding the first anniversary of the declaration of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries.
    The statement congratulated the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. The statement said that since the declaration of the Moscow meeting, the world communist movement has achieved new and great victories. In commemorating the first anniversary of the declaration, the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries are preparing to strive for greater achievements for the people, for the independence and freedom of all countries, and for peace, democracy and socialism.
    The statement said, "The Communist Party of India hails the unity of the world communist movement and guarantees to wage a struggle against all non-Marxist-Leninist tendencies, no matter what disguise they are under."
    The statement said that the Moscow meeting declaration called on the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries "to wage a struggle against revisionism or right-wing opportunism, the main danger at present, and thus made a historically significant contribution to the world communist movement. The revisionist program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia clearly shows that the call to launch this struggle against revisionism was timely."
    The statement said, "Revisionist ideology attempts to undermine people's belief in Marxism-Leninism from within at a time when Marxism-Leninism is achieving its greatest victories. The Communist Party of India guarantees to fight revisionism and dogmatism in its own ranks, to maintain the purity of Marxist-Leninist principles, and to guarantee to defend the principles of proletarian internationalism, and to reject all words and actions that undermine the unity of the world communist movement and the world working class."
    The statement said that the Moscow meeting declaration, "this historic document which summarizes the experience of the world communist movement over the forty years since the great October Revolution, helps to unite the ranks of the world communist movement and promote its development and growth."
    The statement said, "The declaration correctly points out that the camp of peace and socialism, led by the great Soviet Union, is becoming stronger and stronger, while the imperialist war camp is falling apart. Today, peace has become the most important issue for everyone. The declaration correctly points out that the forces of world peace are now practically capable of preventing war. In the past year, the forces of peace, led by the Soviet Union, have repeatedly defeated the US's schemes of aggression."
    The statement pointed out that many events that have occurred in the past year prove that the declaration's assertion that the colonial system is collapsing, imperialism is declining, and socialism is advancing from victory to victory is completely correct.
    Indian Communist Party "Freedom Daily" Editorial
    Communist Parties of All Countries Unite to Draw a Line Between Themselves and Revisionism
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 17th: The Communist Party of India newspaper "Freedom Daily," published in Calcutta, published an editorial yesterday endorsing the statement issued by the National Committee of the Communist Party of India on the first anniversary of the Moscow meeting declaration. The editorial emphasized the need to maintain the purity of Marxism-Leninism and pointed out the significance of conducting a struggle against revisionism.
    The editorial said that the Communist Parties of all countries in the world, inspired by the Moscow meeting declaration, "have strongly criticized the actions of the traitors of the world working class, the Yugoslav revisionists. The Communist Parties of all countries have drawn a line between revisionism and Marxism-Leninism." The editorial pointed out that the Communist Parties of all countries have unanimously launched a struggle to defeat those revisionists who are propagating against proletarian internationalism, the working class's seizure of power, and the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    The editorial said: "The decline of imperialism and the rise of socialism are the laws of historical development. It does not depend on people's subjective wishes. The heads of the imperialist countries, the American reactionaries, fearing this future, are conspiring to destroy the methods of bourgeois democracy in one country after another to forcibly establish military dictatorships. Under these circumstances, the necessity of strengthening the revolutionary consciousness of the Indian revolutionary workers and democratic forces has greatly increased. Therefore, the Communist Party of India has issued a call to struggle against the attempts of revisionism."
    The editorial continued, saying that the Communist Party of India exists in "the struggle to defend peace and democracy in India, at the center of the task of consolidating the revolutionary forces of the people, and in the struggle to establish socialism. The Communist Party must acquire the ability to shoulder this responsibility. It is for this purpose that the responsibility for maintaining the purity of Marxism-Leninism falls on the Communists in India."
    The newspaper, referring to the background of the development of the international situation and the great increase in the forces of peace and socialism, pointed out that "the frustrated and thwarted imperialist bloc is desperately trying to ignite the flames of war like bloodthirsty madmen."
    The editorial also expressed agreement with the argument in the eleventh issue of the Chinese "Red Flag" magazine's editorial, "Hold Higher the Red Banner of the October Revolution."
    Vietnamese "People's Daily" Editorial
    The Unity and Consolidation of the Communist Movement and the Increasingly Turbulent Ideological and Political Upsurge
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 18th: The Vietnamese Labor Party's organ, "People's Daily," published an editorial entitled "Strive Unremittingly for Victory Under the Brilliant Illumination of Two Historical Documents" to commemorate the first anniversary of the declarations of the Moscow meetings of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and the declaration of peace by sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties.
    The editorial said that all true Marxist-Leninist parties unanimously affirmed that these two documents "are the common programs of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. These two documents, like Marx and Engels' 'Communist Manifesto,' are torches that illuminate the working class and working people of all countries towards a bright future and the realization of mankind's noblest ideals."
    The editorial said that in the past year, under the illumination of these two historical documents, the ideological and political upsurge of the powerful world communist and workers' movement has become even stronger. In this regard, the editorial talked about the great victories of the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Germany, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Albania, and Mongolia in building socialism, saying that these eloquently illustrate the invincible strength of Marxism-Leninism.
    The editorial said, "Driven by Western imperialism, modern revisionism, concentrated in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, has once again attempted to undermine the unity of the international communist and workers' movement and distort Marxism-Leninism; it has put forward arguments that are completely contrary to the basic views of the two historical documents. However, the truth about modern revisionism has once again been revealed. Contrary to the intentions of the heads of imperialism and opportunism, after a fierce anti-revisionist struggle on a global scale, the international communist and workers' movement has become more united and stronger than ever before."
    The editorial said that Vietnam's struggle and construction practice in the past year also clearly illustrates the extremely important significance of these two historical documents.
    Albanian "Warrior" and "Voice of Youth" Newspaper Editorial
    The Moscow Declaration Has Profound Scientificity; The Past Year Has Proved That It is Invincible
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 16th: The Albanian "Warrior" magazine and "Voice of Youth" newspaper published editorials on November 16th to commemorate the first anniversary of the Moscow meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties.
    The "Warrior" magazine's editorial said that life has proven that the decisions of the Moscow meeting have profound scientificity. "The Moscow Declaration has further tempered the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, they have become a whole, and have completely exposed the modern revisionists represented by the Yugoslav leadership group, who are servants of imperialism. The principles of the Moscow Declaration have been victorious everywhere. History is advancing, and imperialism and all kinds of revisionism have never been able to make it retreat in the past or now."
    The "Voice of Youth" newspaper's editorial said that only one year has passed from the publication of the two declarations of the Moscow meeting to the present. However, within this year, the international situation has confirmed the correctness of these documents. The editorial said that the international communist movement is growing stronger, the steel-like unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is becoming more and more consolidated, and the struggles of the world people for peace, independence, and a new life are becoming more and more consolidated.
    The editorial said that the Albanian Labor Party always stands on an unshakable, loyal to Marxist-Leninist position, is with the Soviet Union, and resolutely struggles against the enemies of Marxism-Leninism.

    照耀各国人民走向胜利的火炬印共和越阿报纸欢庆莫斯科宣言一周年
  　印度共产党全国委员会发表声明
    社会主义阵营更加强大
    帝国主义阵营分崩离析
    据新华社讯　印度共产党全国委员会书记处13日就社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科代表会议宣言发表一周年发表声明。
    声明向各国共产党和工人党表示祝贺。声明说，莫斯科会议宣言发表以来，世界共产主义运动已经取得了新的巨大的胜利。在纪念宣言发表一周年的时候，世界各国共产党和工人党正在准备为人民，为各国的独立和自由，为和平、民主和社会主义争取更大的成就。
    声明说，“印度共产党欢呼世界共产主义运动的团结一致，并且保证要对一切非马克思列宁主义倾向展开斗争，不论这些倾向是在什么样的伪装之下。”
    声明说，莫斯科会议宣言号召各国共产党和工人党“向修正主义或右倾机会主义这种当前主要的危险展开斗争，因而对世界共产主义运动作出了具有历史意义的贡献。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义纲领清楚地表明，发出这个向修正主义展开斗争的号召是适时的。”
    声明说，“修正主义思潮企图在马克思列宁主义正在取得最大胜利的时候，从内部来破坏人们对它的信仰。印度共产党保证要向自己队伍里的修正主义和教条主义进行斗争，保持马克思列宁主义原则的纯洁性，保证要保卫无产阶级国际主义的原则，摒弃一切破坏世界共产主义运动和世界工人阶级的团结的言论和行动。”
    声明说，莫斯科会议宣言“这项总结伟大的十月革命以来世界共产主义运动四十年的经验的历史性文件，有助于团结世界共产主义运动的队伍，并且促进了这一运动的发展和壮大。”
    声明说，“宣言正确地指出，以伟大的苏联为首的和平和社会主义阵营正在越来越强大，而帝国主义战争阵营正在分崩离析。今天，对每个人来说，和平已经成为最重要的问题。宣言正确地指出，世界和平力量已经有实际可能来防止战争。在过去一年的过程中，以苏联为首的和平力量曾经多次击败了美国的侵略阴谋。”
    声明指出，一年来发生的许多事件证明，宣言中关于殖民主义体系正在瓦解，帝国主义正在衰退，而社会主义则从胜利走向胜利的论断是完全正确的。
    印共“自由报”社论
    各国共产党团结一致同修正主义划清界限
    新华社新德里17日电　在加尔各答出版的印度共产党报纸“自由报”昨天发表社论，表示拥护印度共产党全国委员会就莫斯科会议宣言公布一周年发表的声明。社论强调必须维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，并且指出进行反对修正主义斗争的意义。
    社论说，为莫斯科会议宣言所鼓舞的世界各国共产党“已经强烈地批判了世界工人阶级的叛徒、南斯拉夫修正主义者的行动。各国共产党已经在修正主义和马克思列宁主义之间划清界限”。社论指出，世界各国共产党已经一致展开斗争，以击败那些正在宣传反对无产阶级国际主义、工人阶级掌握政权和无产阶级专政的修正主义者。
    社论说：“帝国主义的衰落和社会主义的上升是历史发展的法则。它并不取决于人们的主观愿望。帝国主义国家的头子、美国反动派由于害怕这个前途，正在阴谋在一个又一个的国家里破坏资产阶级民主的办法来强行建立军事独裁。在这种情况之下，加强印度革命工人和民主力量的革命觉悟的必要性大大增加了。因此，印度共产党发出了向修正主义的企图进行斗争的号召。”
    社论接着说，印度共产党存在于“保卫印度的和平和民主的斗争中，存在于巩固人民革命力量的任务的中心，存在于争取建立社会主义的斗争中。共产党必须取得担负这个责任的能力。正是为了这个目的，保持马克思列宁主义的纯洁性的责任就落到印度共产党人的身上。”
    这家报纸在谈到国际局势发展的背景以及和平和社会主义力量大大增加时指出，“沮丧的和受到挫折的帝国主义集团正在像嗜血的狂人一样极力企图燃起战争的火焰。”
    社论还表示赞同中国“红旗”杂志第十一期的社论“更高地举起十月革命的红旗”的论点。
    越南“人民报”社论
    共产主义运动团结巩固思想政治高潮日益汹涌
    新华社河内18日电　越南劳动党机关报“人民报”以“在两个历史文件的光辉照耀下不懈地胜利奋斗”为题发表社论，纪念社会主义国家共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议宣言和六十四个共产党和工人党的和平宣言发表一周年。
    社论说，所有真正的马列主义的政党都一致确认，这两个文件“是各国共产党和工人党的共同纲领。这两个文件和马克思、恩格斯的‘共产党宣言’一样，是照耀各国工人阶级和劳动人民走向光辉前途、实现人类最高贵的理想的火炬”。
    社论说，一年来，在这两个历史文件的照耀下，强大的世界共产主义和工人运动的思想和政治高潮已经更加壮大起来。社论在这方面谈到苏联、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、民主德国以及罗马尼亚、波兰、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚和蒙古在建设社会主义方面的巨大胜利，它说，这些都雄辩地说明了马列主义的不可战胜的力量。
    社论说，“在西方帝国主义的驱使下，集中表现在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领中的现代修正主义，再一次企图破坏国际共产主义和工人运动的团结一致，歪曲马列主义；提出同两个历史文件的基本观点完全相反的论调。但是，现代修正主义的真相再一次被揭发出来了。同帝国主义和机会主义的头子们的意图相反，经过了全世界规模的反修正主义的激烈斗争以后，国际共产主义和工人运动已经比任何时候更加统一和强大。”
    社论说，越南过去一年中的斗争和建设实践，也清楚地说明了这两个历史文件的极重大的意义。
    阿“战士”和“青年之声报”社论
    莫斯科宣言有深刻科学性  一年来已证明它无往不胜
    据新华社地拉那16日电　阿尔巴尼亚“战士”杂志和“青年之声报”16日发表社论，纪念各国共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议一周年。
    “战士”杂志的社论说，生活已经证明，莫斯科会议的决定具有深刻的科学性。“莫斯科宣言更加锻炼了各国共产党和工人党，他们已经成为一个整体，并且完全揭露了以帝国主义的奴仆南斯拉夫领导集团为代表的现代修正主义者。莫斯科宣言的原则到处都获得了胜利。历史正在前进，帝国主义和形形色色的修正主义过去和现在永远不能使它后退”。
    “青年之声报”的社论说，从莫斯科会议发表两个宣言到现在，仅仅经过了一年。但是，在这一年内，国际形势已证实了这些文件的正确性。社论说，国际共产主义运动正日益壮大，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营钢铁般的团结正日益巩固，世界人民为和平、独立和新生活而进行的斗争正日益巩固。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党永远站在不可动摇的、忠于马克思列宁主义的立场上，和苏联在一起，坚决跟马克思列宁主义的敌人进行斗争。
