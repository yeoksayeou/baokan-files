    Welcome the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Morocco
    The People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Morocco yesterday (November 1st) issued a joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations, announcing the decision to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries, and both sides will establish diplomatic missions on a mutually agreed date. This is a joyous event for the people of China and Morocco, and also a new symbol of friendly cooperation between China and the Arab people.
    Although China and Morocco are geographically separated by towering mountains and vast oceans, they have had a traditional peaceful and friendly relationship for more than 700 years in history. In our historical books, there are vivid records of Morocco—formerly known as the Mulampi Kingdom—and the exchanges between the people of China and Morocco. For many centuries, trade and cultural ties between our two countries have continued to develop. It was only due to the invasion of Asia and Africa by imperialism in the last hundred years that this friendly exchange was once interrupted. However, the Chinese people's concern and friendship for the Moroccan people have never been changed by the obstacles created by colonialism.
    The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with Morocco's struggle for freedom and independence, and are pleased with the victory achieved by the Moroccan people's long-term struggle. It is precisely for this reason that when Morocco declared its independence on March 2, 1956, the Chinese government and people expressed warm congratulations, hoping that the Moroccan people would achieve new successes in safeguarding national sovereignty and developing the national economy.
    Morocco's independence has not only restored the friendly relations between our two countries that were once interrupted, but has also brought encouraging new developments. The delegation of the Moroccan National Consultative Assembly, the Moroccan government trade delegation, the Moroccan student delegation, and people from all walks of life in Morocco have successively visited our country. The Chinese government trade delegation, trade union delegation, student delegation, and acrobatic troupe have also visited Morocco. Recently, the governments of China and Morocco signed a trade agreement with a total export value of 5.1 billion Moroccan francs, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and exchange of needed goods. These friendly visits and economic ties have promoted mutual understanding between the two peoples and are in line with the common interests of the two peoples.
    We firmly believe that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Morocco and the friendship between the two peoples will be further strengthened due to the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Haji Muhammad Buamrani, head of the delegation of the Moroccan National Consultative Assembly to China, member of the Moroccan Independence Party, and first vice chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, said during his visit to China in 1957: "The Maghreb (Moroccan) people and government not only welcome the spirit of the Bandung Conference—the spirit of Asian-African people's unity—but also hope that this spirit will be maintained forever." These words expressed the good wishes of the Moroccan people. The Chinese people, who adhere to the principles of the Bandung Conference in international affairs, are willing to work together with the Moroccan people to realize the common aspirations of friendly cooperation between China and Morocco and between Asian and African countries.

### 欢迎中摩两国建交

    欢迎中摩两国建交
    中华人民共和国和摩洛哥王国昨天（1日）发表了关于建立外交关系的联合公报，宣布决定建立两国外交关系，双方将在一致同意的日期互设外交代表机构。这是中、摩两国人民的一件喜事，也是中国和阿拉伯人民友好合作的一个新的标志。
    中国与摩洛哥，虽然在地理上隔着崇上峻岭和宽阔的海洋，但是在历史上已有七百多年的传统的和平友好关系。在我国的史书中，关于摩洛哥国家——从前称为木兰皮国——以及中摩两国人民的交往，有着生动的记载。许多世纪以来，我们两国之间的贸易和文化的联系，曾不断有所发展。只是由于近百年来帝国主义的侵入亚洲、非洲，这种友好往来才一度中断。但是，中国人民对于摩洛哥人民的关怀和友谊，从未为殖民主义所造成的障碍而有所改变。
    中国人民对摩洛哥为争取自由独立而进行的斗争，一向寄予深切的同情，并且对摩洛哥人民长期斗争所取得的胜利感到高兴。正因为如此，当1956年3月2日摩洛哥宣布独立以后不久，我国政府和人民就表示热烈的祝贺。希望摩洛哥人民在维护国家主权和发展民族经济方面获得新的成就。
    摩洛哥的独立，不仅使我们两国一度中断了的友好关系得到恢复，并且有了令人鼓舞的新发展。摩洛哥国民协商议会代表团、摩洛哥政府贸易代表团、摩洛哥学生代表团以及摩洛哥其他各界人士，先后到我国访问。我国政府贸易代表团、工会代表团、学生代表团和杂技团等，也访问了摩洛哥。最近，中摩两国政府更依据平等互利、互通有无的精神，签订了一项双方出口总额达五十一亿摩洛哥法郎的贸易协定。这些友好访问和经济联系促进了两国人民的相互了解，符合于两国人民的共同利益。
    我们深信，中摩两国的友好合作关系、两国人民的友谊，将由于两国的正式建交而得到进一步的增强。摩洛哥国民协商议会访华代表团团长、摩洛哥独立党议员、议会预算委员会第一副主席哈吉·穆罕默德·布阿姆拉尼，1957年访问我国的时候说过：“马格里勃（摩洛哥）人民和政府不仅欢迎万隆会议精神——亚非人民团结的精神，同时也希望这种精神将永远保持下去。”这话表达了摩洛哥人民的良好愿望。在国际事务中坚持奉行万隆会议的原则的中国人民，愿与摩洛哥人民共同努力，来实现中国和摩洛哥以及亚洲和非洲国家友好合作的共同愿望。
