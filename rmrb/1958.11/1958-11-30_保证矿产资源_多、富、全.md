In recent months, a grand nationwide mass mineral exploration movement has unfolded, giving geological work a new look, and resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest of mineral resources. This fact once again proves that no matter what the work is, as long as the Party's mass line is implemented, it can transform from being lackluster to vigorous; it proves that adhering to putting politics in command and launching mass movements can not only produce more grain and more steel, but also more minerals.

In the past, some people thought that geological science was too high to reach, limiting geological work to the narrow circle of professional geological teams, and even mistakenly believing that the development of geological work depended solely on the growth of geological technical forces, completely ignoring the power of the broad masses. This thinking once hindered the faster development of geological undertakings. In recent months, thanks to the personal attention of Party committees at all levels to geological work, a climax of mass participation in geological undertakings has been set off. Many Party committee secretaries personally led the masses to explore for treasures in the deep mountains; many primary and secondary school teachers and students, the People's Liberation Army, and even elderly people in their seventies and eighties actively participated in the mineral exploration and reporting movement. In some provinces, the number of people going to the mountains to look for minerals has reached several millions. The powerful mass movement has promoted geological work to quickly move from the narrow circle of professional teams to a new world of broad development, from the original 200,000+ people doing geological work to millions of the broad masses doing geological work; enabling geological work to achieve unprecedented and tremendous results on the entire front of prospecting and exploration. Now, more than 150,000 mineral sites of various types have been found across the country, equivalent to three and a half times the total number of mineral sites found during the First Five-Year Plan period. Among them, there are more than 500 large mines, including more than 140 large iron mines alone. It is estimated that the proven reserves of various major minerals this year will exceed the national plan by several to more than ten times. This greatly improves the distribution of mineral resources in our country, and prepares a large amount of mineral resources for the widespread development of small and medium-sized enterprises and for the high-speed development of our country's industry with steel as the key link.

Although the mass mineral exploration movement this year has promoted the great leap forward of geological work, the already proven reserves of various minerals still cannot fully meet the needs of the Second Five-Year Plan due to the high-speed development of our country's industry. The regional distribution of minerals is not balanced enough; the resource supply of some industrial departments and provinces, cities, and autonomous regions is still quite tight; especially the mineral resources needed by small and medium-sized industries and non-ferrous metals and cutting-edge industries are still far from enough. 1959 is a decisive year for the three-year hard struggle on our country's economic front, and both industrial and agricultural construction will have greater development, and the geological departments must arrange their work at the same high speed. Therefore, it is necessary to hold high the red flag of the theory of continuous revolution, continue to go all out on the basis of the great achievements that have been made, and strive for another leap forward in geological work, providing more and better mineral reserves for the higher-speed development of our country's industry in the future, so that geological work can truly play the role of a vanguard of industrial construction.

In order to implement the industrial construction policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises, geological work must meet the needs of large enterprises and also meet the needs of small and medium enterprises. Large enterprises are the backbone of our country's industry, and we must continue to vigorously search for large mines to prepare sufficient raw material bases for large enterprises. This is without question. However, providing mineral resources for small and medium-sized enterprises is also an important task of geological work. In the geological departments, there are still a very few people who do not pay attention to small mines, are unwilling to find resources for small and medium-sized enterprises, and believe that finding small mines costs money, time, and manpower, and hinders the completion of reserve tasks. These ideas are one-sided. Comrades who hold these ideas neither understand the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises in our country's industrial construction, nor do they understand that large mines can be found from small and medium-sized deposits. Many large mines are often not discovered at the beginning, but are discovered through continuous exploration of small and medium-sized deposits. Looking down on small and medium-sized deposits will make it impossible to find large deposits. Taking Henan Province as an example, in the past few months, not only have a large number of small and medium-sized iron mines been found in 90% of the counties, but also several large iron mines have been found, solving the problem of iron ore resources for the steel base in the Central Plains region that has not been solved for several years. This fully proves that as long as we truly establish a comprehensive view of serving large, medium, and small enterprises, and arrange the geological forces well, it is entirely possible to find more small and medium-sized deposits without hindering the search for large mines, in order to meet the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises for mineral resources.

Guaranteeing that mineral resources are "abundant, rich, and comprehensive" is the most urgent requirement of current industrial construction for geological work. "Abundant" means that there should be many mineral sites; "rich" means that the ore grade should be rich; "comprehensive" means that the main raw materials, fuels, and auxiliary raw materials required for industrial production should be met as completely as possible. Our country's future industrial layout will be mainly decentralized rather than centralized, so there is a need for more mineral sites. The mineral reserves already proven in our country are still very insufficient in rich ore, so there is a need for more rich ore. The distribution of various minerals is not balanced enough, so there is a need for "comprehensive." The "abundance, richness, and comprehensiveness" of minerals is of utmost importance to both large and small and medium-sized enterprises. Comparing 100 million tons of iron ore reserves with "abundant, rich, and comprehensive" conditions with 1 billion tons of iron ore reserves without "abundant, rich, and comprehensive" conditions, although the latter's reserves are nine times more than the former, the former can play a greater role economically and politically than the latter. Therefore, geological departments at all levels should make the greatest efforts to meet the "abundant, rich, and comprehensive" requirements put forward by industrial construction, and use this as an important indicator to assess the quality of geological work, preventing the tendency to simply pursue quantity without paying attention to quality.

The deployment of geological work must also be closely combined with the transportation network and the actual needs of industrial construction. Under the current circumstances of heavy geological tasks and insufficient geological forces, we can only concentrate our main energy to first identify the mineral reserves that are most urgently needed for industrial construction and that can be utilized most quickly. Large-scale prospecting and exploration work should generally be limited to the vicinity of the existing and soon-to-be-built land and water transportation lines within three to five years. Even if the transportation is convenient and the prospects of the mining area are very large, it should be limited to identifying the reserves that meet the industrial requirements in terms of quality and can meet the needs of the industrial development plan; the rest should be completed after prospecting and clarifying the prospective reserves. If the actual needs of transportation conditions and industrial construction are not taken into account, and too many reserves that are difficult to utilize in the short term are identified, it will inevitably cause waste of manpower and material resources and affect the greater leap forward of geological work.

In the geological team, it is necessary to continue to break superstitions, emancipate the mind, and conscientiously implement the general line of socialist construction in the formulation and implementation of rules and regulations. We advocate combining our country's actual situation, flexibly and creatively applying various rules and regulations, and improving the exploration speed as soon as possible, opposing the tendency to deviate from the actual situation, mechanically executing norms, and inappropriately increasing the degree of exploration and various industrial indicators, so as to delay the exploration and construction speed. We must ensure that the proven mineral reserves can meet the minimum requirements of industrial design, so that industrial production is economically and technically possible to make full use of; we oppose destroying the norms without any basis, not considering the minimum requirements of industrial production for the degree of mineral exploration and ore grade, one-sidedly pursuing more and faster, but not paying attention to good and economical, causing waste of manpower, material resources and time.

Among the leading cadres and technical personnel of geological departments at all levels, it is necessary to advocate seeking truth from facts and avoid exaggeration. For the geological conditions of their work area, they should say good if it is good, bad if it is bad, and how much reserve if it is how much reserve. Exploring the mineral resources of an area is for the convenience of rationally arranging construction projects and developing our country's industry in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. It is not conducive to construction to say more as less, or to say less as more; to say good as bad, or to say bad as good. We must work in a down-to-earth manner and resolutely overcome the floating and unrealistic style of individual leaders and technical personnel.

In the situation of galloping in which steel is the key link, mass movements are carried out on a large scale, and our country's industry is developing at a high speed, the task of geological work is arduous. However, the mass movement of geological work has been formed nationwide. As long as we continue to adhere to putting politics in command, conscientiously implement the mass line of the whole party and the whole people running geology, improve the geological knowledge of the mineral-finding masses, and improve the quality of work, we will certainly be able to provide more and better mineral resources for the high-speed development of our country's industry.

### 保证矿产资源“多、富、全”

    保证矿产资源“多、富、全”
    近几个月，在全国范围内展开了一场规模宏伟的全民找矿运动，使地质工作出现了崭新的面貌，矿产资源获得了空前大丰收。这一事实，又一次证明了无论任何工作，只要贯彻党的群众路线，就可以由冷冷清清变成轰轰烈烈；证明了坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，不仅多出粮多出钢，也可以多出矿。
    过去有些人认为地质科学高不可攀，把地质工作限制在地质专业队伍的狭小圈子里，甚至错误地认为地质工作的发展仅仅取决于地质技术力量的成长，根本忽视广大群众的力量。这种思想曾经阻碍了地质事业更快的发展。近几个月由于各级党委亲自抓地质工作，掀起了群众大办地质事业的高潮。许多党委书记亲自率领群众到深山探宝；不少地方的中小学师生、人民解放军，以至七、八十岁的老人，也都积极参加了找矿报矿运动。有些省上山找矿的群众已达几百万人。声势浩大的群众运动，促进了地质工作很快地从狭小的专业队伍的圈子走向广阔发展的新天地，由原来二十几万人办地质工作变成千百万的广大群众办地质工作；使地质工作在整个普查勘探战线上，获得了空前巨大的战果。现在全国已经找到各种矿点十五万余处，相当于第一个五年计划期间找到的矿点总和的三倍半。其中大矿五百多处，仅大铁矿就有一百四十多处。预计今年探明的各种主要矿产的储量，都将超过国家计划的几倍到十几倍。这就大大地改善了我国的矿产分布情况，为中小型企业的遍地开花，为我国以钢为纲的工业高速度发展，准备了大量的矿产资源。
    今年全民找矿运动的开展，虽然促进了地质工作的大跃进，但由于我国工业的高速度发展，现在已经探明的各种矿产储量，仍不能完全满足第二个五年建设的需要。矿产的地区分布还不够平衡；有些工业部门和省、市、自治区的资源供应还相当紧张；特别是中小型工业以及有色金属和尖端工业所需要的矿产资源，还相差很远。1959年是我国经济战线上苦战三年具有决定性的一年，工业农业的建设都将有更大的发展，地质部门必须以同样的高速度来安排自己的工作。因此，必须高举不断革命论的红旗，在已经取得的伟大成绩的基础上，继续鼓足干劲，力争地质工作跃进再跃进，为我国今后工业的更高速度发展，提供数量更多、质量更好的矿产储量，使地质工作真正起到工业建设尖兵的作用。
    为了贯彻大中小型企业相结合的工业建设方针，地质工作必须既要满足大型企业的需要，也要满足中小型企业的需要。大型企业是我国工业的骨干，我们必须继续大力寻找大矿，为大型企业准备足够的原料基地，这是没有疑问的。但是，为中小型企业提供矿产资源，也是地质工作的重要任务。在地质部门中，还有极少数人不重视小矿，不愿为中小企业找资源，认为找小矿费钱费时费人，又妨碍完成储量任务。这些想法是片面的。抱有这些想法的同志，既不了解我国工业建设中的大中小型企业相结合的方针，也不了解可以从中小矿床中找到大矿。许多大矿往往不是一开始就被发现的，而是人们对中小矿床继续进行勘探中发现的。看不起中小矿床，就找不到大矿床。以河南省为例，在过去几个月中，不仅在90％的县里找到了大量的中小铁矿，同时也找到了几处大铁矿，解决了几年来一直未能解决的中原地区钢铁基地的铁矿资源问题。这就充分证明，只要真正树立为大中小型企业服务的全面观点，很好地安排地质力量，就完全有可能在不妨碍找大矿的前提下，找到更多的中小矿床，以满足中小企业对矿产资源的需要。
    保证矿产资源“多、富、全”，是当前工业建设对地质工作所提出的最迫切的要求。“多”就是矿产地要多；“富”就是矿石品位要富；“全”就是工业生产所需要的主要原料、燃料和辅助原料，要尽可能的全部满足。我国今后的工业部署，将主要是分散而不是集中，所以需要矿产地多。我国现在已经探明的矿产储量，富矿还很感不足，所以需要更多的富矿。各种矿产的分布情况，还不够平衡，所以需要“全”。矿产的“多、富、全”，无论对于大型企业或中小型企业，都有着极其重要的意义。一亿吨具备“多、富、全”条件的铁矿储量和十亿吨不具备“多、富、全”条件的铁矿储量比较，虽然后者的储量多于前者九倍，但是前者却要比后者在经济上和政治上能发挥更大的作用。因此，各级地质部门，应该尽最大努力来满足工业建设所提出的“多、富、全”的要求，并以此作为考核地质工作质量的重要指标，防止单纯追求数量而不注意质量的偏向。
    地质工作的部署，还必须和交通网和工业建设的实际需要紧密结合。在目前地质任务很重、地质力量不足的情况下，只能集中主要精力，首先探明工业建设最急需，并且有可能最快利用的矿产储量。大规模的普查勘探工作，一般应限制在现有的和三、五年内即将建设的水陆交通线附近。即使交通方便，矿区远景很大，也应以探明质量合乎工业要求，可以满足工业发展规划所必需的储量为限；其余则在作完普查，弄清远景储量后，即应结束工作。如不考虑交通条件和工业建设的实际需要，探明过多的难以在短期利用的储量，势将造成人力和物力的浪费，影响地质工作的更大跃进。
    在地质队伍中，必须继续破除迷信、解放思想，在制订和执行制度规范方面，认真贯彻社会主义建设总路线。我们提倡结合我国的实际情况，灵活地创造性地运用各种规章制度，尽快地提高勘探速度，反对脱离实际情况、机械执行规范，不适当地提高勘探程度和各种工业指标，以致延缓勘探和建设速度的偏向。我们要保证探明的矿产储量能够满足工业设计的最低要求，使工业生产在经济上、技术上都有可能充分利用；反对毫无根据地破坏规范，不考虑工业生产对矿产勘探程度和矿石品位的最低要求，片面地追求多快，而不注意好省，造成人力、物力和时间上的浪费。
    在各级地质部门的领导干部和技术人员中，必须提倡实事求是，力戒虚夸。对于自己工作地区的地质情况，应该是好就说好，是坏就说坏，是多少储量就说多少储量。探明一个地区的矿产资源，为的是便于合理安排建设项目，多快好省地发展我国工业。把多说成少，或者把少说成多；把好说成坏，或者把坏说成好，都不利于建设。我们必须踏踏实实地工作，坚决克服个别领导人员和技术人员的浮而不实的作风。
    在以钢为纲，大搞群众运动，高速度地发展我国工业的万马奔腾的形势中，地质工作的任务是艰巨的。但是，地质工作的群众运动已经在全国范围内形成，只要我们今后继续坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻全党全民办地质的群众路线，提高找矿群众的地质知识，提高工作质量，就一定能够为我国工业的高速度发展提供更多更好的矿产资源。
