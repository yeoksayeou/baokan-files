The employees of the Mu Ding Copper Mine in Yunnan Province have successfully created a "Leap Forward Furnace" by integrating the advantages of various indigenous copper smelting furnaces.

This furnace has the following advantages: First, the belly of the furnace is large at the top and small at the bottom, shaped like an inverted "eight," making it difficult for "shuttle birth" (raw material sinking) to occur. Second, the hearth is circular, resulting in more even wind exposure than a square hearth, with no dead corners, and less prone to nodule formation. Third, it can continuously produce copper. When the hearth is full of molten copper, the copper outlet can be opened to release the copper, and the furnace continues to produce normally, unlike ordinary indigenous furnaces that need to be shut down to release copper, thus increasing the utilization rate by more than double that of ordinary indigenous furnaces. In addition, this furnace is built with refractory sand and stone and refractory mud, making it inexpensive to build and more fuel-efficient (coke ratio averages 18%-20%, with a minimum of 12.3%). Therefore, it is hailed as a red flag among the nation's indigenous copper smelting furnaces.

This furnace can smelt oxide ores or a mixture of oxide and sulfide ores. The Mu Ding Copper Mine uses a mixture of oxide and sulfide ores, with an input grade of 1%-2%. It can process 2.5 to 3 tons of ore per day. With mechanical blowing, it can process up to 5 tons of ore per day, producing 20 kilograms of blister copper daily.

Each shift requires six to seven people to operate this furnace. (Attached picture)

    牟定跃进炉
    云南省牟定铜矿职工综合了各种炼铜土炉的优点，创造成功一种“跃进炉”。
    这种炉子有以下几个优点：一、炉腹上大下小，呈倒“八”字形，因而不易产生梭生（生料下沉）现象。二、炉缸是圆型，炉内受风面比方型炉缸均匀，没有死角，不易发生结瘤等现象。三、可以连续出铜。当炉缸装满铜水时，可以打开出铜口放出铜水，炉子仍旧照常生产，不像一般土炉需要停炉出铜，利用率比一般土炉提高一倍以上。此外，这种炉子用耐火砂石和耐火泥砌成，造价便宜，用燃料也比较省（焦比平均为18％—20％，最低达12.3％）。因此，它被誉为全国炼铜土炉中的一面红旗。
    这种炉子可以冶炼氧化矿或用氧化矿和硫化矿混合熔炼。牟定铜矿用氧化矿和硫化矿混合熔炼，入炉品位为1％—2％。每天可处理矿石二点五到三吨。如采用机械鼓风，每日处理矿石最高可达五吨。日产粗铜二十公斤。
    在这种炉子上操作的人数，每班六至七人。（附图片）
