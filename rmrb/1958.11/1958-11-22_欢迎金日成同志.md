    Welcoming Comrade Kim Il-sung
    Yang Zhihua
    This October, I participated in the delegation to Korea led by Comrade Guo Moruo. I personally witnessed the heroic deeds and socialist construction achievements of the Korean people under the leadership of the Workers' Party. I am very excited. I would like to welcome Comrade Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, with all my enthusiasm.
    The Korean people have high aspirations,
    Chollima displays its heroism,
    Diligent labor creates much,
    The beautiful rivers and mountains are like the spring dawn.
    The democratic base has beautiful scenery,
    Factories and schools are built everywhere,
    Rice ripens all over the fields like gold,
    Maple leaves on the mountains burn like fire.
    Recalling the three-year war to defend the country,
    The contribution to defending peace is not small.
    First, it punctured the paper tiger,
    Construction races against electricity.
    The American imperialists' indiscriminate bombing is in vain,
    Narrow paths become broad roads,
    Yesterday's ruins become mansions,
    Today's Pyongyang is even more beautiful.
    The 38th parallel divides the North and South Koreas,
    Light and darkness are in stark contrast.
    Looking south, few wisps of smoke rise from desolate villages,
    Looking north, the harvested grain is piled high.
    The people's leader, Kim Il-sung,
    Long live cheers resound throughout the peninsula,
    The five-year plan will be completed ahead of schedule,
    Everyone praises the good leadership.
    Long live the Workers' Party,
    The hearts of the compatriots in the North and South are one,
    Three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains,
    Peaceful reunification will come in the future.
    Sharing weal and woe makes us intimate friends,
    The friendship between China and Korea is higher than the mountains,
    The rising sun shines, the red flag flutters,
    The east wind blows, the west wind falls.

    欢迎金日成同志
    杨之华
    今年10月，我参加以郭沫若同志为首的访朝代表团到了朝鲜，亲眼看到朝鲜人民在劳动党领导下的英勇的事迹和建设社会主义的成就，感到非常兴奋。谨以满腔的热情来欢迎朝鲜人民的领袖金日成同志。
    朝鲜人民志气高，
    千里马上逞英豪，
    辛勤劳动多创造，
    锦绣河山如春晓。
    民主基地风光好，
    到处建厂办学校，
    遍地稻熟似黄金，
    满山枫叶如火烧。
    回思三年卫国战，
    保卫和平功不小。
    首先戳穿纸老虎，
    建设更同电赛跑。
    美帝烂炸是徒劳，
    羊肠小路变大道，
    昨日废墟成大厦，
    今日平壤更美好。
    三八线分南北朝，
    光明黑暗相对照。
    南望荒村炊烟少，
    北顾丰收禾堆高。
    人民领袖金日成，
    万岁欢呼遍半岛，
    五年计划准提前，
    人人歌颂好领导。
    万岁欢呼劳动党，
    南北同胞心一条，
    锦绣河山三千里，
    和平统一在明朝。
    患难相共成知交，
    中朝友谊比山高，
    旭日东升红旗飘，
    东风吹来西风倒。
