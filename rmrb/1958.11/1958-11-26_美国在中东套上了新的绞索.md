New Aggressive Conspiracy

The United States is intensely engaged in a new aggressive conspiracy to mend the Baghdad Pact and strengthen the so-called "Northern Tier Alliance" in the Middle East.

When the U.S. and Britain launched their armed invasion of Lebanon and Jordan, they made arrangements to repair the Baghdad Pact, particularly to strengthen military deployments in Iran and the Persian Gulf region. The American military forces stationed in Turkey were rapidly strengthened. In the Persian Gulf region, the United States and Britain also assembled a large number of troops. At the Baghdad Pact Council meeting held in London at the end of July, the United States decided to conclude bilateral military agreements with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan in order to further control these three countries and strengthen its aggressive activities in the Middle East. After the meeting, the United States first gave Turkey a "aid" of 230 million U.S. dollars, satisfying the demands repeatedly made by the Turkish ruling group in the past two or three years. Subsequently, senior American generals made frequent trips between Karachi, Tehran, and Ankara. After the military coup in Pakistan, U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy personally visited the remaining Muslim member states of the Baghdad Pact to make specific arrangements for concluding bilateral military treaties with these countries.

After the U.S. and British invasion troops were forced to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, the U.S. activities to repair the Baghdad Pact and strengthen the so-called "Northern Tier Alliance" became more frequent. At the Baghdad Pact Military Committee meeting held on November 5, the U.S. "Northern Tier Alliance" plan was further affirmed, and discussions on bilateral military agreements were intensified in the capitals of Turkey, Pakistan, and Iran. Among them, the negotiations between the United States and Iran on concluding a military agreement have been conducted openly.

Plans to Repair the Baghdad Pact

What are the main contents of the plan to repair the Baghdad Pact and strengthen the so-called "Northern Tier Alliance"? According to various sources, there are the following aspects:

First, the main foundation of this plan is the bilateral military treaties that the United States is preparing to sign separately with Turkey, Pakistan, and Iran. Before the July Revolution in Iraq, the United States had already signed bilateral military agreements with Turkey and Pakistan, namely the "U.S.-Turkey Military Cooperation Agreement" of 1947 and the "U.S.-Pakistan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" of 1954. Now, what the United States wants to complete is to sign a bilateral military agreement with Iran. The repaired Baghdad Pact will become a military group directly and fully controlled by the United States to a greater extent, based on bilateral military treaties.

Another important part of the U.S. plan is to strengthen its control over Iran and the Persian Gulf region. As early as May this year, U.S. Commander of Armed Forces in the Middle East, Major General Bruegeris, British Commander-in-Chief of Middle East Land Forces, Lieutenant General Bower, and Pakistani Naval Commander-in-Chief, Major General Chaudhri, held negotiations with Iranian military authorities in Tehran to discuss the so-called "New Persian Gulf Defense Plan." According to Iranian newspapers, the main points of this plan are: to use the Persian Gulf region as the "main center of attack and defense" for the Baghdad Pact; the United States will build bases in Iran, and U.S. troops will be stationed in Iran. However, since there was no bilateral military agreement between the United States and Iran at that time, the construction of bases by the United States in Iran had no explicit "legal basis." Therefore, signing a U.S.-Iran bilateral military treaty became the key to realizing this plan. After the victory of the Iraqi Revolution, the United States intensified its efforts to promote this plan and expanded its scale. The United States not only strengthened its military forces in the Persian Gulf, but also wanted to establish a Fifth Fleet, namely the Indian Ocean Fleet, to threaten countries along the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean; in addition, the U.S. activities of building bases in Iran have been extended from the original Persian Gulf coast to the hinterland adjacent to Iraq and the Soviet Union.

The United States is also attempting to undermine Afghanistan's policy of peace and neutrality and pull it into the "Northern Tier Alliance." In May this year, the United States instigated the King of Iran and the President of Pakistan to carry out a plan to establish an alliance between Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The authorities of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey have all publicly proposed the establishment of a "federation" with Afghanistan. However, the Afghan government explicitly rejected this request. A spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry said: "The Afghan government has not raised the issue of joining such an alliance. Afghanistan's policy is very clear, it is based on neutrality and non-participation in groups."

Finally, further squeezing out Britain's influence in the Persian Gulf and its influence on the remaining Baghdad Pact is also an important part of U.S. activities. The Persian Gulf region and the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula have always been important bases for British aggression in the Middle East. At the Bermuda talks in 1957, the United States had to express its recognition of Britain's position in this region. The great victory of the Iraqi Revolution severely hit the imperialist aggression against the Middle East, and the blow to Britain was even more direct. It not only weakened Britain's influence in the Persian Gulf region, but also made Britain lose a closest "ally" in the Baghdad Pact. The United States immediately took the opportunity to express its intention to further intervene in the Persian Gulf region. The U.S. "Northern Tier Alliance" activity is to make Britain a more secondary partner in the remaining Baghdad Pact.

Where is the Spearhead Pointing?

The U.S. plan to repair the Baghdad Pact and strengthen the so-called "Northern Tier Alliance" is a naked aggressive plan. Its spearhead is mainly aimed at the United Arab Republic, the newly born Republic of Iraq, and the national independence movements of other Arab countries. From the day of its birth, the Baghdad Pact has been an important tool for the United States and Britain to suppress the national independence movement in the Middle East. Its member state, Turkey, and the Faisal Dynasty of Iraq, have more than once carried out military threats and subversive activities against Arab countries that adhere to national independence. The victory of the Iraqi Revolution broke the backbone of the Baghdad Pact, disrupted the aggressive deployments of the United States and Britain, and the entire national independence movement in the Middle East was greatly encouraged by the victory of the Iraqi Revolution. But the United States is still unwilling to abandon this Baghdad Pact without Baghdad, and attempts to use it as a tool to strangle the Republic of Iraq and invade the entire Middle East. The Baghdad Pact Council meeting held in London at the end of July used opposition to the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic as the keynote of the entire event. The meeting openly praised and supported the aggressive actions of the United States and Britain in sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan, and used the pretext for aggression by the United States and Britain, namely the so-called "resistance to direct and indirect aggression," as the reason for the United States and the three Muslim member states to conclude bilateral military agreements.

The spearhead of the U.S. conspiracy is also aimed at the struggle of the people of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan for independence and freedom. The ruling groups of these three countries have been pursuing a policy of arms expansion and war preparations following the United States for many years, which has caused serious deterioration of the domestic political and economic situation, and constant turmoil and chaos. In January this year, when Dulles went to Turkey to attend the Baghdad Pact Council meeting, the U.S. Embassy in Turkey was bombed, a large number of military officers were arrested, and Defense Minister Erkin was forced to resign. At the beginning of this year, the Iranian government uncovered a case in which the United States instigated military officers to carry out subversive activities and arrested a large number of military officers. The King of Iran also publicly criticized the U.S. oil consortium for exerting pressure on the Iranian government. The situation of political turmoil and economic difficulties in Pakistan is also very prominent. The victory of the Iraqi Revolution has had a great impact in these three countries. Leaflets distributed in the name of the "National Liberation Committee" were found in Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey, calling on the people and the army to rise up and overthrow the government. The people of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan expressed widespread sympathy and support for the victory of the Iraqi Revolution, and demanded to withdraw from the Baghdad Pact and change the diplomatic policy of blindly following the United States. This situation shocked the United States and the reactionary groups in these countries. While the United States instigated military dictatorial coups in some countries to crack down on patriotic democratic forces, it was eager to carry out the "Northern Tier Alliance" activities in order to "establish a strong military system" and tightly bind them to the chariot.

A Dead Horse Cannot Be Ridden as a Live Horse

The U.S. plan to repair the Baghdad Pact and strengthen the so-called "Northern Tier Alliance" is not new. As early as May 1953, when U.S. Secretary of State Dulles visited the Middle East, he proposed a plan for the United States to independently organize the "Northern Tier Alliance." The main contents of this plan are: to start with Turkey and Pakistan and conclude military alliance treaties; at the same time, step up planning for subversive activities against Iran, overthrow the Mossadegh government, and establish a U.S. proxy regime. Then, these three countries would form an aggressive system controlled by the United States, including most of the Middle Eastern countries, based on the "Northern Tier Alliance" and using U.S. "aid" as bait to win over Arab countries.

According to this plan, the United States manufactured a military coup in Iran in August 1953. In April of the following year, the United States instigated Turkey and Pakistan to conclude a military alliance, and then the United States and Pakistan signed a bilateral military treaty. At the same time, the United States threw out the bait of U.S. "aid" to Arab countries such as Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon. Later, in order to obtain U.S. support for its aggressive activities against Egypt, Britain agreed to use its influence on the Faisal Dynasty of Iraq to make Iraq join the Turkish-Pakistani military alliance. Thus, the "Northern Tier Alliance," originally planned to be independently controlled by the United States, became the Baghdad Pact with British participation and U.S. manipulation behind the scenes. Now, the victory of the Iraqi Revolution has brought the Baghdad Pact to the brink of disintegration, and the United States has re-introduced the plan to establish the so-called "Northern Tier Alliance" to save the collapse of the colonial system in the Middle East.

However, the current situation in the Middle East has undergone tremendous changes compared to the situation in 1953 when Dulles proposed the "Northern Tier Alliance" aggression plan.

In the past five years, the flames of the national independence movement in the Middle East have burned more and more vigorously. The Arab people have continuously defeated the military aggression and interference by the United States, Britain, and France, making the Baghdad Pact finally unable to escape the fate of bankruptcy. It not only gave a severe blow to Britain, the old colonial country, but also smashed the black flag of the U.S. "Eisenhower Doctrine." The aggressive face of the United States has been further exposed, and the people of the Middle East have listed it as the number one aggressor. The U.S. aggressive activities to repair the Baghdad Pact and strengthen the so-called "Northern Tier Alliance" have aroused the vigilance and anger of the people of various Middle Eastern countries. With the support of the socialist camp and peace-loving people of all countries, they will surely be able to smash the new aggressive conspiracy of the United States. Neither the repaired Baghdad Pact nor the resurrected "Northern Tier Alliance" can ride a dead horse as a live horse, and can only become a new noose around the neck of the United States.

    美国在中东套上了新的绞索
    邢象超
    新的侵略阴谋
    美国修补巴格达条约集团和加强所谓中东“北层联盟”的新侵略阴谋活动，正在紧张地进行中。
    美英发动武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦时，就对修补巴格达条约集团、特别是加强在伊朗和波斯湾地区的军事部署问题作了安排。驻在土耳其的美国军事力量迅速得到加强。在波斯湾地区，美英两国也集结了大批部队。在7月底举行的巴格达条约集团理事会伦敦会议中，美国决定和土耳其、伊朗以及巴基斯坦缔结双边军事协定，以进一步控制这三个国家，加强对中东地区的侵略活动。会议结束以后，美国首先给了土耳其一笔二亿三千万美元的“援助”，满足了土耳其统治集团近两三年来多次提出的要求。接着，美国高级将领便在卡拉奇、德黑兰和安卡拉之间进行了频繁的奔走活动。巴基斯坦发生军事政变以后，美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊更亲自访问了巴格达条约集团残存的穆斯林成员国，具体安排和这些国家缔结双边军事条约问题。
    美英侵略军队被迫撤出黎巴嫩和约旦以后，美国修补巴格达条约集团和加强所谓“北层联盟”的活动，更加频繁起来。在11月5日召开的巴格达条约集团军事委员会会议上，美国的“北层联盟”计划又有了进一步的肯定，并在土、巴、伊的首都加紧商谈双边军事协定，其中美国同伊朗缔结军事协定的谈判已在公开进行。
    修补巴格达条约的计划
    修补巴格达条约集团和加强所谓“北层联盟”的计划有些什么主要内容呢？根据各方透露，有下述几个方面：
    第一，这个计划的主要基础是美国和土耳其、巴基斯坦以及伊朗准备分别签订的双边军事条约。在伊拉克7月革命以前，美国和土耳其、巴基斯坦已签订了双边军事协定，这就是1947年的“美、土军事合作协定”和1954年的“美、巴共同防御援助协定”。现在美国所要完成的是同伊朗签订双边军事协定。修补过的巴格达条约集团，将在双边军事条约基础上，成为在更大程度上受美国直接、全面控制的军事集团。
    美国计划的另一个重要内容是加强对伊朗以及波斯湾地区的控制。早在今年5月间，美国驻中东武装部队司令布格里斯少将、英国中东陆军总司令鲍尔中将、巴基斯坦海军总司令乔德里少将便曾和伊朗军事当局在德黑兰举行谈判，讨论所谓“波斯湾防御新计划”。根据伊朗报纸透露，这个计划的要点是：以波斯湾地区作为巴格达条约集团“进攻和防御的主要中心”；美国在伊朗境内建筑基地，美军驻扎伊朗。但是，由于美、伊之间当时并无双边军事协定，美国在伊朗境内建筑基地是没有明文的“法律根据”的，因此，签订美、伊双边军事条约就成了实现这个计划的关键。伊拉克革命胜利后，美国更加紧推行这个计划，并把规模加以扩大。美国不仅加强了波斯湾内的军事力量，而且还要建立第五舰队，即印度洋舰队，威胁阿拉伯海和印度洋沿岸国家；另外，美国在伊朗建筑基地的活动，也由原计划的波斯湾沿海推广到了邻近伊拉克和苏联的腹地。
    美国还企图破坏阿富汗的和平中立政策，把它拉进“北层联盟”中去。今年5月间，美国便曾指使伊朗国王和巴基斯坦总统进行建立伊朗、巴基斯坦和阿富汗联盟计划。伊朗、巴基斯坦和土耳其当局都曾公开提出和阿富汗结成“联邦”的要求。但阿富汗政府明确地拒绝了这一要求。阿富汗外交部发言人说：“阿富汗政府并未提出参加这种联盟的问题。阿富汗的政策很明确，它是建立在中立和不参加集团基础上的”。
    最后，进一步排挤英国在波斯湾的势力和它对残存的巴格达条约集团的影响，也是美国活动的一项重要内容。波斯湾地区和阿拉伯半岛南部，一直是英国侵略中东的重要基地。在1957年的百慕大会谈中，美国曾不得不表示承认英国在这一地区的地位。伊拉克革命的伟大胜利，严重地打击了帝国主义对中东的侵略活动，而对英国的打击则更为直接，不仅削弱了英国对波斯湾地区的影响，也使英国在巴格达条约集团内部失去了一个关系最密切的“盟国”。美国立即乘机表示要进一步插手波斯湾地区。美国的“北层联盟”活动，是要使英国在残存的巴格达条约集团中成为一个更加次要的伙计。
    矛头指向哪里
    美国修补巴格达条约集团和加强所谓“北层联盟”的计划，是一个赤裸裸的侵略计划。它的矛头主要针对阿拉伯联合共和国、新生的伊拉克共和国以及其他阿拉伯国家的民族独立运动。从巴格达条约集团的诞生之日起，就是美英两国镇压中东民族独立运动的重要工具。它的成员国土耳其以及伊拉克的费萨尔王朝都曾不止一次地向坚持民族独立的阿拉伯国家进行军事威胁和颠覆活动。伊拉克革命的胜利，打断了巴格达条约集团的脊骨，打乱了美英两国的侵略部署，整个中东地区的民族独立运动都从伊拉克革命胜利得到了巨大鼓舞。但美国仍然不愿放弃这个没有了巴格达的巴格达条约，而且企图利用它来作为扼杀伊拉克共和国和侵略整个中东的工具。在7月底举行的巴格达条约集团理事会伦敦会议，就是以反对伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国作为整个活动的基调的。会议公然赞扬和支持美英出兵黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略行为，而且把美英进行侵略的借口，即所谓“抵抗直接和间接侵略”，作为美国和三个穆斯林成员国缔结双边军事协定的理由。
    美国阴谋计划的矛头，也同时指向土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦各国人民争取独立自由的斗争。这三个国家的统治集团多年来追随美国执行着扩军备战政策，已经造成了国内政治经济情况的严重恶化，不断出现动荡和混乱。今年1月，杜勒斯去土耳其参加巴格达条约集团理事会会议的时候，美国驻土大使馆便曾受到炸弹轰击，大批军官被捕，国防部长厄尔金被迫辞职。在今年初，伊朗政府揭发了美国指使军官进行颠覆活动的案件，逮捕了大批军官。伊朗国王也公开抨击了美国石油财团对伊朗政府施加压力的行为。巴基斯坦政局动荡和经济困难的情况也很突出。伊拉克革命的胜利，在这三个国家中引起了极大的影响。在土耳其的安卡拉和伊斯坦布尔等地曾发现以“民族解放委员会”名义散发的传单，号召人民和军队起来推翻政府。土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦人民对伊拉克革命胜利表示了广泛的同情和支持，纷纷要求退出巴格达条约集团，改变一意追随美国的外交政策。这种情况使美国以及这些国家的反动集团感到万分震惊。美国在一些国家策动军事独裁政变，打击爱国民主力量的同时，急于进行“北层联盟”活动，就是为了“建立起一个强大的军事系统”，紧紧地把它们绑在战车上。
    死马当不了活马骑
    美国修补巴格达条约集团、加强所谓“北层联盟”的计划并不是什么新的东西。早在1953年5月间，美国国务卿杜勒斯访问中东的时候，就曾提出过由美国单独组织“北层联盟”的计划。这个计划的主要内容是：先从土耳其和巴基斯坦入手，订立军事同盟条约；同时加紧策划对伊朗的颠覆活动，推翻摩萨台政府，建立美国代理人政权。然后，这三国组成以“北层联盟”为基础，以美“援”为钓饵，拉拢阿拉伯国家入伙，建立由美国控制的、包括大部中东国家的侵略体系。
    根据这个计划，美国在1953年8月，在伊朗制造了军事政变。第二年4月，美国指使土耳其和巴基斯坦缔结军事同盟，接着美、巴两国又订立了双边军事条约。同时，美国向约旦、伊拉克、黎巴嫩等阿拉伯国家抛出了美“援”钓饵。之后，英国为了取得美国支持它对埃及的侵略活动，同意利用它对伊拉克费萨尔王朝的影响，使伊拉克加入土巴军事同盟。于是，原来计划由美国单独控制的“北层联盟”就成为有英国参加、美国退居幕后操纵的巴格达条约集团。现在，伊拉克革命的胜利，使巴格达条约集团趋于瓦解，美国便重新拿出建立所谓“北层联盟”方案，来挽救殖民制度在中东的崩溃。
    但是，目前中东形势已经和1953年杜勒斯提出“北层联盟”侵略方案时的形势有了巨大变化。
    五年多来，中东民族独立运动的火焰越烧越旺，阿拉伯人民连续击败了美英法的军事侵略和干涉行为，使巴格达条约终于逃避不了破产的命运，不仅给了英国这个老牌殖民国家以严重的打击，也把美国的“艾森豪威尔主义”的黑旗打得粉碎。美国的侵略面目已进一步暴露，中东人民把它列为第一号的侵略者。美国修补巴格达条约集团和加强所谓“北层联盟”的侵略活动，已经引起了中东各国人民的警惕和愤怒，他们将在社会主义阵营和各国爱好和平人民的支持下，一定能够粉碎美国的新侵略阴谋。不论是修补过的巴格达条约或是死灰复燃的“北层联盟”，都不能把死马当活马骑，只能成为套在美国脖子上的一条新的绞索。（附图片）
