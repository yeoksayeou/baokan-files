(Reported by this newspaper) The 1958 National Marathon Championship was held in Beijing on the morning of November 3. Our country's excellent marathon runners created world-class results. The top four athletes' scores all exceeded the highest Olympic record, and the fifth-place score also exceeded the first-place score of the 16th Olympic Games. Eight athletes surpassed the score of the winner of the 28th International Marathon held in Koons on October 12th this year. A total of more than one hundred athletes participated in the competition, with eighty-one breaking national records and thirty-two reaching the standard of Master Athlete.

The champion was Zheng Zhaoxin from Inner Mongolia, with a score of 2 hours, 21 minutes, and 29 seconds. Another Inner Mongolian athlete, Zhang Yuncheng, took second place with a time of 2 hours, 21 minutes, 43.4 seconds.

Zheng Zhaoxin is less than twenty-three years old this year and is a teacher at the Inner Mongolia Sports School. Zheng Zhaoxin and Zhang Yuncheng only started practicing in 1955, and both were participating in a marathon for the first time. Zheng Zhaoxin's score is the second-best in the world this year. The highest score this year is 2 hours, 15 minutes, and 17 seconds, created by Soviet athlete Popov.

The third place was Li Cunye from Yunnan Province, with a score of 2 hours, 22 minutes, and 42.8 seconds.

The thirty-five-year-old veteran You Yunting from Shandong Province won fourth place with a score of 2 hours, 22 minutes, and 48.2 seconds.

The fifth place was Cui Shiyi from Shanxi Province, with 2 hours, 24 minutes, and 41.4 seconds. The sixth place was veteran long-distance runner Zhang Xiling from Liaoning Province.

The world-renowned long-distance runner from Czechoslovakia, Zatopek, and his wife, Zatopekova, who are currently visiting our country, watched the race by car. He often stopped in front of the water stations, checked the time, and helped the staff pour water for the athletes. After Zheng Zhaoxin reached the finish line, he immediately ran over to hug Zheng Zhaoxin and congratulate him on his success.

The marathon race is an ultra-long-distance race, with a total length of 42 kilometers and 195 meters. It is generally held on roads. Marathon is the name of a place east of Athens, the capital of Greece. In 490 BC, the Greeks won a great victory in Marathon against the invading Persian army. A warrior named Pheidippides ran from Marathon to Athens to report the victory. He shouted "Victory" in the Athens square and died of exhaustion. In 1896, the first Olympic Games were held in Athens, and a long-distance race from Marathon to Athens was specially held to commemorate him, and it was included in international competition events. Our country has not been carrying out this sport for long, and the provinces that have developed it better have only done so for a few years. However, our athletes have already created excellent results. (Attached picture)

    全国马拉松锦标赛大放异彩
    五人成绩超过奥运会冠军
    八十一人打破全国纪录　三十二人达到健将标准
    本报讯　1958年全国马拉松锦标赛3日上午在北京举行。我国优秀的马拉松选手创造了世界水平的成绩。前四名运动员的成绩都超过了奥运会最高成绩，第五名的成绩也超过了第十六届奥运会第一名的成绩。八名运动员超过今年10月12日在科恩斯举行的第二十八届国际马拉松赛冠军的成绩。总共有一百多名选手参加的比赛，有八十一人打破全国纪录，三十二人达到运动健将标准。
    获得冠军的是内蒙古选手郑昭信，成绩是2小时21分29秒，另一个内蒙古选手张云程以2小时21分43秒4取得第二名。
    郑昭信今年不到二十三岁，是内蒙古体育学校的教员。郑昭信和张云程都是1955年才开始练习，而且都是第一次参加马拉松比赛。郑昭信的成绩是今年世界上第二个最好成绩，今年最高成绩是2小时15分17秒，是苏联选手波波夫创造的。
    第三名是云南省的李存业。成绩是2小时22分42秒8。
    三十五岁的山东老将酉云亭获得第四名，成绩是2小时22分48秒2。
    第五名是山西省的崔世一，2小时24分41秒4。第六名是长跑老将辽宁省的张希苓。
    正在我国访问的世界著名长跑家、捷克斯洛伐克老将扎托倍克和他的夫人扎托倍克娃坐汽车观看了比赛，在饮水站前，他经常停下来，看看时间，并帮助工作人员倒水给运动员喝。郑昭信到终点后，他马上跑过来和郑昭信拥抱，祝贺他的成功。
    马拉松赛跑，是一种超长距离赛跑，全长四十二公里一百九十五公尺。一般都在公路上进行。马拉松是希腊首都雅典东面的一个地名，公元前四百九十年希腊人在马拉松地方抗击入侵的波斯军队大胜，有一个叫裴德匹第斯的战士，从马拉松奔跑到雅典报告胜利消息，他在雅典广场高呼“胜利”后力竭而死。1896年第一届奥林匹克运动会在雅典举行，特别举行了一次从马拉松到雅典的长跑来纪念他，并列入国际竞赛项目。我国开展这项运动的时间还不久，开展较好的省份，也不过几年时间。但我国运动员已创造出优异的成绩。（附图片）
