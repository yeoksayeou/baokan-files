Japanese Cartoonist's Pen Attacks Nobusuke Kishi

    The Prime Minister drives recklessly,
    The people's iron fists block the way,
    The car ahead serves as a lesson for the car behind,
    The American master shouts in vain.

    Police batons act as conducting wands,
    Waving fists keep time,
    A highbrow song hard to continue,
    A tyrant shouts himself hoarse in vain.

    Police swords are disguised as walking sticks,
    A smiling face hides a sinister heart,
    A fox's tail cannot be concealed,
    A war criminal's disguise is useless.

    Fierce and malevolent police chief, refusing the people to walk on the good road,
    Forcing a deep abyss as a paradise, bringing disaster to the country and harm to the people, a crime unforgivable.

    日漫画家笔伐岸信介
    首相开车胡乱闯，
    人民铁拳把路挡，
    前车堪为后车鉴，
    美国主子白叫嚷。
    警棍权充指挥棒，
    舞动拳头打拍忙，
    曲槽和寡难为继，
    独夫徒然喊破嗓。
    警刀装作文明棍，
    笑面难把祸心藏，
    狐狸尾巴掩不住，
    战犯伪装没用场。
    凶神恶煞巡捕头，好路不让人民走，
    硬把深渊当乐土，祸国殃民罪难宥。
    （原载日本“赤旗报”）
