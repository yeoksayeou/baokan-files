    Breaking Through the Obstacles to the Leap Forward in Medical Science - Hierarchy
    Qiu Renzong, Chen Ziyang, Guo Shaojun
    Although the units under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences have been transformed to varying degrees in previous movements, changing their political outlook and service direction, the bourgeois worldview and outlook on life of the bourgeois intellectuals (of which bourgeois rights ideology and hierarchical concepts are a component) have not been fundamentally transformed. Moreover, they have vigorously maintained and propagated this hierarchy everywhere. Therefore, the bourgeois hierarchy in medical science departments has basically not changed.
    Suppressed the Wisdom and Talent of the Masses
    Helped Experts to Detach Themselves from Reality
    The titles in medical science departments are numerous, the levels complex, and the boundaries strict. Many are not necessary divisions of labor. Medical personnel are divided into interns, junior resident physicians, senior resident physicians, chief resident physicians, attending physicians, group attending physicians, and department directors; nursing personnel are divided into nursing aides, assistant nurses, and nurses; teaching personnel are divided into teaching assistants, lecturers, associate professors, and professors; research personnel are divided into research interns, assistant researchers, associate researchers, and researchers; technical personnel are divided into trainees, technicians, assistant engineers, engineers, and chief engineers. Each level is sometimes further divided into several small grades. The scope of work between each level is insurmountable. Higher-level personnel can possess certain technical work privileges, while lower-level personnel lose the right to participate in certain technical work. Deciding what work a person does depends less on the needs of the work and the person's work ability and technical level than on the person's rank and "qualifications." Deciding how much remuneration a person receives is less based on the quality and quantity of labor than on "education," "academic titles," and "degrees." For example, nurses are not allowed to perform treatment work because nurses do not have the "qualifications" to perform treatment work, even the simplest routine treatments. Resident physicians cannot do research work because resident physicians only have the qualifications for treatment, and research work is "unfathomable." If a technician summarizes the treatment effect and diagnostic method of a disease, he will be immediately stopped by the professor because only physicians are qualified to do this kind of work. Although technicians and resident physicians are refused entry into the door of research, many research projects cannot do without the help of resident physicians and technicians. Some professors openly say: "I use their hands, not their brains." Some professors use the privileges of high rank to seize the research results of lower-level personnel as their own, add their own names or simply publish them under their own names, and order lower-level personnel to interrupt this research. Department professors are especially superior. New data must be mastered by him, and new operations must be performed by him first. The joy and anger of the department professor can affect the actions of the entire department. Hierarchy has formed a patriarchal system in some departments. The bourgeois experts regard this very uncivilized patriarchal rule as sacred and inviolable.
    The above situation has two results: on the one hand, it suppresses the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, so that the talents of many young lower-level personnel have no opportunity to develop; on the other hand, bourgeois experts are becoming more and more detached from the vivid reality and drilling into the "ivory tower" of science. In the final analysis, it seriously hinders the development of medical science in our country.
    This kind of hierarchical system is a concrete manifestation of bourgeois rights in medical science departments. It creates many artificial contradictions between doctors and nurses, between superiors and subordinates, and among colleagues, making it impossible to work together wholeheartedly for the health of the people.
    Leadership Relations and Necessary Division of Labor Should Be Affirmed
    The Bourgeois Hierarchy Must Be Denied
    Some people say, "This is not hierarchy, this is not inequality, let alone privilege, this is division of labor, this is the authority of leadership." Yes, being intertwined with division of labor and leadership relations is precisely the characteristic of the bourgeois hierarchy in medical science departments. Therefore, it easily confuses and deceives the masses. What we oppose is the bourgeois hierarchy, the inequality between people in working relationships, not the rejection of scientific division of labor, not the rejection of leadership. In medical science departments, the following two types of division of labor cannot and cannot be eliminated: one type is the division of labor between departments and disciplines, such as some people engaging in obstetrics and gynecology, some people engaging in ophthalmology, and some people engaging in neurology; the other type is the division of labor in specific work, such as some people engaging in nursing, some people engaging in laboratory testing, and some people engaging in medical treatment. Although everyone in the medical science department must also become a versatile person, in any case, the above two types of division of labor will always exist. Similarly, the relationship between leaders and those being led in any work will also always exist. To fight against nature and fight against disease, there must always be commanders and combatants. Therefore, the opinion of requiring the cancellation of all job titles in hospitals and uniformly calling them "medical staff" is "throwing out the baby with the bathwater."
    The necessary division of labor and leadership relations should not be regarded as unequal relationships between people, or as a bourgeois hierarchy; similarly, the bourgeois hierarchy should not be said to be a necessary division of labor and leadership relationship. Is it necessary for the division of labor that nurses are not allowed to perform medical treatment, resident physicians are not allowed to do research, and technicians are not allowed to write experience? Is it necessary for leadership relations that professors use subordinates as tools for pursuing fame and profit? Obviously not.
    The Masses Rise Up to Break Through the Hierarchy
    The Department of Neurology of Peking Union Medical College Erects a Red Flag
    After the rectification movement, the socialist and communist consciousness of all comrades in the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has been raised to an unprecedented level. An unprecedented leap forward has emerged. In the technical revolution in the past three months, tens of thousands of creative and innovative projects have been created, and more than 2,000 creative inventions and innovations are of relatively high value. However, our work still cannot keep up with the needs of production development and people's lives. The remnants of bourgeois rights and the bourgeois hierarchy are increasingly seriously hindering the great leap forward in work. The masses are becoming more and more intolerable of the remnants of bourgeois rights and the bourgeois hierarchy, and are automatically rising up to break through the hierarchy. The comrades of the Department of Neurology of the Affiliated Beijing Union Medical College of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences have taken the lead in erecting a red flag in this regard. This department has begun to break the shackles of the bourgeois hierarchy and bourgeois rights concepts, and has begun to establish equal relationships between people in work. They began to allocate work according to work needs and personal abilities instead of allocating work according to "levels" and "qualifications." Senior physicians no longer stand high above the ground and detach themselves from reality, but are delegated to outpatient clinics and wards to specifically undertake outpatient and medical work. Subordinate personnel can also participate in medical and research work that they could not access in the past. All members of the department are striving to become versatile, everyone can treat, everyone can nurse, everyone can perform acupuncture, implement technical democracy, cooperate in treatment, and hold "Zhuge Liang meetings." In research and medical work, the party organization is the core, replacing the authority to "govern," and so on. All of this has greatly strengthened the unity among all medical staff, superiors and subordinates, and workers and retirees in the department. The face of the entire department has changed greatly in a few days. They have not only incorporated scientific research into the national plan and greatly improved work efficiency, but also found more effective treatments for cerebrovascular diseases and neurasthenia, which were previously considered difficult to treat by authorities. These iron facts prove that only by breaking the bourgeois concept of rights can the technical revolution continue to leap forward.

    冲破医学科学跃进的障碍——等级制
    丘仁宗　陈子扬　郭少军
    中国医学科学院所属的单位虽然在历次运动中都得到了不同程度的改造，改变了他们的政治面貌和服务方向，但是由于资产阶级知识分子的世界观和人生观（资产阶级法权思想、等级观念是其中一个组成部分）没得到根本的改造，并且还极力维护和到处宣扬这种等级制。因此，医学科学部门中的资产阶级等级制基本上没有改变。
    压制了群众的聪明才智
    助长了专家的脱离实际
    医学科学部门中的职衔名目繁多，层次复杂，界限森严。有许多并不是必不可少的分工。医疗人员有实习医师、初级住院医师、高级住院医师、住院总医师、主治医师、分组主治医师及科主任之分；护理人员有护理员、助理护士、护士之分，教学人员有助教、讲师、副教授、教授之分；研究人员有实习研究员、助理研究员、副研究员、研究员之分；技术人员有练习生、技术员、技士、技师、总技师之分。每一级之中有时又分若干小等级。各级之间的工作范围是不可逾越的，等级高的人员可以拥有某些技术工作上的特权，而等级低的人员则丧失参加某些技术工作的权利。决定一个人作什么工作，与其说根据工作需要和本人工作能力和技术水平，不如说根据这个人所属的等级和“资格”，决定一个人领取多少报酬，与其说以劳动的质量与数量为尺度，还不如说以“学历”、“学衔”、“学位”为尺度。比如护士是不许作治疗工作的，因为护士没有作治疗工作的“资格”。哪怕最简单的常规治疗。住院医师是不能作研究工作的，因为住院医师只有治疗的资格，研究工作是“高深莫测”的。技术员要是总结一种病的治疗效果和诊断方法，马上会被教授制止，因为这种工作只有医师才有资格作。技术员、住院医师虽然被拒绝于研究的大门之外，实际上许多研究工作又离不开住院医师、技术员的帮助，有的教授公开说：“我用的是他们的双手，不是他们的头脑。”有的教授利用等级高的特权，把下级人员的研究成果攫为己有，加上自己的名字或索性用自己名字发表，并勒令下级人员中断这种研究，主任教授尤其高人一等，新资料必须由他掌握，新手术必须由他先作，主任教授的喜怒可以左右全科的行动。等级制在有些科系中形成了家长制。而资产阶级专家把这种很不文明的家长式统治奉为神圣，不得破坏。
    上述情况就造成两个结果：一方面压制了群众的积极性创造性，使得许多年青的下级人员的才能没有机会得到发展；另一方面资产阶级专家愈来愈脱离了生动的实际，钻进了科学的“象牙之塔”中去，归根到底，严重阻碍了我国医学科学的发展。
    这种等级制度是资产阶级法权在医学科学部门中的具体表现。它在医护之间，上下级之间，同级之间造成许多人为的矛盾，不能同心协力为人民的健康服务。
    领导关系和必要分工应肯定
    资产阶级的等级制必须否定
    有人说，“这不是等级制，这不是不平等，更不是特权，这是分工，这是领导的职权。”是的，与分工、领导关系交错在一起正是医学科学部门中资产阶级等级制的特点，因此它容易迷惑群众和欺骗群众。我们反对的是资产阶级等级制，人与人在工作关系上的不平等，并不是不要科学的分工，不要领导。在医学科学部门中，下列两类分工是不能也无法消灭的：一类是部门、学科的分工，如有人搞妇产科，有人搞眼科，有人搞脑系科等；一类是具体工作上的分工，如有人搞护理，有人搞化验，有人搞医疗等。虽然在医学科学部门中每个人也都要成为多面手，但是，无论如何，上述两类分工，总是存在的。同样，任何工作中领导与被领导的关系也是要永远存在的，与自然作战，与疾病作战总要有指挥员，有战斗员。因此，要求取消医院所有的职务称号一律统称“医务员”的意见是“把脏水和小孩一起倒掉了”。
    不能把必要的分工、领导关系看成是人们之间的不平等关系，看成是资产阶级等级制；同样，也不能把资产阶级的等级制，说成是必要的分工和领导关系。护士不准作医疗，住院医师不准作研究，技术员不准写经验是分工所必需的吗？教授利用下级作为他追求名利的工具，这是领导关系所必需的吗？显然不是。
    群众起来冲破等级制
    协和脑系科树起红旗
    中国医学科学院全体同志经过整风运动，社会主义和共产主义觉悟空前提高。出现了空前未有的大跃进局面。在三个月以来的技术革命中，创造和革新项目数以万计，比较有价值的创造发明和革新项目达两千多项。但是，我们的工作仍然赶不上生产发展和人民生活的需要。资产阶级法权残余、资产阶级等级制度愈来愈严重地阻碍着工作的大跃进。群众对于资产阶级法权残余和资产阶级等级制，愈来愈不能忍受了，自动起来冲破等级制。医学科学院附属北京协和医院脑系科的同志们在这方面首先树起了红旗，这个科已经开始打破资产阶级的等级制度和资产阶级法权观念的束缚，开始树立了人与人在工作中的平等关系，开始根据工作需要与个人能力分配工作而不是根据“级别”与“资格”分配工作，高级医师也不再高高在上的脱离实际，而是下放到门诊病房具体担负门诊和医疗工作，下面的人员也能参加过去不能问津的医疗工作和研究工作了，全科人员都在争取自己成为多面手，人人会治疗，人人会护理，人人会针灸，实行技术民主，协作治疗，开“诸葛亮会”；在研究和医疗工作中以党组织为核心，代替权威“执政”等等。这一切使全科医护、上下、工休之间的团结大为增强，几天内全科的面貌大大改观。他们不仅把科学研究纳入了国家规划，大大提高了工作效率，过去一直被权威认为很难治疗的脑血管病和神经衰弱症，现在却找到了比较有效的治疗方法，这些铁的事实证明，只有打破资产阶级的法权观念，技术革命才能继续跃进。
