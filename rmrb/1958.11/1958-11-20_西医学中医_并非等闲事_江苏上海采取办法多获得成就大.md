The People's Daily, Nanjing, November 18th: Jiangsu Province resolutely implements the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Over the past two years, it has adopted various measures to encourage Western doctors to study TCM, laying a good foundation for creating a new socialist national medicine in China that combines Western and Chinese medicine.

Jiangsu Province has a long history of TCM, with many famous doctors throughout the ages, and a rich medical heritage. In the old society, due to the Kuomintang's destruction of TCM, TCM undertakings declined year by year. After liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiangsu Province greatly restored and developed the TCM cause. Now, there are more than 22,000 TCM doctors in the province, 21 TCM hospitals, and 114 general hospitals with TCM departments. Fifteen new TCM hospitals and schools, and one TCM research institute have been built. In order to further inherit and carry forward the legacy of Chinese medicine, a vigorous upsurge of Western doctors studying TCM has been launched in various places.

Jiangsu Province began to widely promote the work of Western doctors learning TCM in 1956. Various places have adopted five different forms of learning in carrying out this work: First, large-scale on-the-job TCM training classes for Western doctors were held in various places. Eight cities, including Nanjing, Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Nantong, and Yangzhou, established such training classes. Nearly 300 Western doctors from 97 units have systematically studied TCM for two years. Second, off-the-job TCM research classes for Western doctors were opened, specifically selecting senior Western doctors to study and research TCM theory and TCM clinical experience for two and a half years. Third, TCM mobile teaching was organized. For example, the Jiangsu Provincial College of Traditional Chinese Medicine dispatched experienced TCM doctors to conduct acupuncture mobile teaching in various counties throughout the province. A total of 72 sessions were held, enabling more than 5,400 TCM and Western doctors to learn acupuncture. Fourth, in general hospitals with TCM departments, mutual learning and exchange of experience were conducted through TCM and Western medicine consultations and clinical cooperation. Fifth, various places regularly held lectures for Western doctors to learn TCM. These learning forms have achieved great results in helping Western doctors learn TCM.

At the beginning of Western doctors learning TCM in various places, it was not smooth sailing. Many Western doctors, due to being influenced by bourgeois academic thought for a long time, had serious resistance to TCM and held attitudes of contempt and discrimination. Many Western doctors mistakenly believed that TCM was "unscientific," comparing Western medicine to "atomic bombs" and TCM to "bows and arrows," saying that learning TCM was "going backwards." Some even absurdly said that there were no foreign literature references for learning TCM, etc. Due to the strengthening of leadership by party committees at all levels and the Western doctors' own specific study for a period of time, the thinking of many Western doctors has changed. The vast number of Western doctors deeply realized that TCM is a great treasure house and requested to systematically study TCM theory. These Western doctors can also learn and use simultaneously. Some who have learned TCM treatment methods directly use Chinese medicine prescriptions to treat patients. For example, Zhong Ronggeng, a Western doctor in Wuxi City, used Chinese medicine to treat 138 cases of patients with high blood pressure. Zhou Qi?, a Western doctor in Changzhou City, learned the TCM compression therapy and thread-embedding therapy to treat hemorrhoids scab. Guo Zhongfang, a Western doctor at Suzhou Medical College, used acupuncture to cure "pulseless disease," which cannot be treated in the world.

Recently, Jiangsu Province used the method of launching a mass movement to set off a new mass upsurge of Western doctors learning TCM throughout the province. In Nanjing, 100% of Western doctors have participated in TCM learning. Other cities and counties have successively proposed guarantees to further extensively promote Western doctors learning TCM. TCM courses have also been generally increased in various medical colleges and schools, and a set of teaching plans for development towards the integration of Chinese and Western medicine has been formulated. The province requires that all Western doctors simultaneously possess TCM techniques within three to five years, creating conditions for the motherland to create new medicine and leap to the world peak.

The People's Daily, Shanghai, November 18th: The Shanghai medical community has recently launched a widespread upsurge of Western doctors learning TCM, requiring every Western doctor to learn the general theory of TCM and master both TCM and Western medicine techniques.

Currently, medical staff in hospitals and clinics throughout the city are learning acupuncture techniques. The Yulin District Western Medical Association used "plum blossom needle" acupuncture therapy to treat hypertension, rheumatic diseases, neurasthenia, and other diseases, treating more than 720 cases, with an effective rate of 70% to 100%. A surgeon at Huadong Hospital cooperated with a TCM doctor to use acupuncture to treat appendicitis. Many patients who entered the hospital with bent backs and clutching their stomachs quickly eliminated pain, inflammation subsided, and white blood cells returned to normal after acupuncture, and they went home within two or three days. Now, this hospital uses acupuncture therapy for the vast majority of appendicitis patients, no longer performing surgery, and has cured 100 people.

In the course of learning, many hospitals and medical colleges also launched a blooming and contending and debate on how to promote cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine. During the debate, many people used the rich achievements created by TCM in Shanghai and across the country to thoroughly refute the erroneous arguments that attempted to negate TCM, such as "TCM is unscientific," and clearly recognized that Western doctors learning TCM is not simply a combination of Western medical methods and TCM methods, but must master TCM theory and techniques, especially learning the TCM spirit of "dialectical treatment." Shanghai First Medical College has opened a night university for teachers to learn TCM and Chinese medicine. The Traditional Chinese Medicine course at Shanghai Second Medical College has been increased from the original 54 hours to 100 hours, with TCM doctors systematically teaching the theoretical knowledge of TCM. The 59 Western doctors studying in the TCM research class, after two and a half years of full-time study, have written 180 papers on learning TCM theory and experience. They are now beginning to use TCM principles such as starting from the whole and supporting the righteous and dispelling evil to treat diseases in their internships.

In order to accelerate the cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine and create our own medical school in China, TCM and Western doctors from Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, First Medical College, and the Institute of Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences are cooperating to sort out TCM clinical experience, widely collect folk prescriptions, and conduct systematic research. They have used self-made meridian measuring instruments and other instruments to find many acupoints of the twelve meridians, and have initially grasped some of the changing patterns of the meridians. Many studies have not only proven that meridian theory is not a fictitious empty theory, but also provided many new scientific bases.

    西医学中医　并非等闲事
    江苏上海采取办法多获得成就大
    本报南京18日电　江苏省坚决贯彻党的中医政策，两年中采取各种措施使西医坚持学习中医，为中西医学结合创造出我国社会主义的民族的新医学，奠定了良好的基础。
    江苏省中医历史悠久，历代名医辈出，有着丰富的医学遗产。在旧社会里由于国民党对中医的摧残，中医事业逐年冷落了。解放后在中国共产党领导下，江苏省大大地恢复和发展了中医事业。现在全省共有中医二万二千多名，中医院二十一所，有一百一十四个综合性医院内设立了中医科，新建中医院、校十五所和中医研究所一个。为了进一步继承、发扬祖国医学遗产，各地都先后掀起了轰轰烈烈的西医学习中医的热潮。
    江苏省普遍开展西医学习中医的工作是在1956年就开始的。各地在开展这个工作中采取了五种不同的学习形式：第一，大规模地在各地举办了在职西医学习中医的学习班，南京、徐州、镇江、常州、无锡、苏州、南通、扬州等八个市都建立了这样的学习班，有九十七个单位的近三百名西医两年来系统地学习了中医学。第二，开办了离职西医学习中医研究班，专门抽调了高级西医在二年半的时间内学习研究中医理论和中医临床经验。第三，组织中医巡回教学，如江苏省中医学院抽调了有经验的中医到全省各县进行针灸巡回教学，前后共举办了七十二期，使五千四百多个中、西医学会了针灸。第四，在设有中医科的综合性医院内通过中西医会诊临床合作，互相学习，交流经验。第五，各地都定期举办了西医学习中医讲座。这些学习形式在帮助西医学习中医上都取得了很大的成绩。
    各地西医在学习中医开始时也不是一帆风顺的。许多西医由于长期受着资产阶级学术思想的影响，对中医存在着严重的抵触情绪和轻视歧视的态度。不少西医错误地认为中医“不科学”，把西医比作“原子弹”，中医比作“弓箭”，说学习中医是“开倒车”。还有人竟荒唐地说学习中医学没有外国文献参考等。由于各级党委对西医的加强领导，和西医本身经过一个时期的具体学习，很多西医的思想都转变了。广大西医都深刻体会到中医学是个伟大的宝库，要求系统学习中医理论。这些西医还能边学边用，有的学会中医治疗方法，便直接使用中药处方治疗病人。如无锡市西医锺荣赓就用中药治疗高血压病人一百三十八例。常州市西医周启?学会了中医的压缩疗法、挂线疗法治疗痔疮痂。苏州医学院西医过中方用针灸治好了目前世界上还不能治疗的“无脉症”。
    最近江苏省用开展运动的办法，在全省又掀起了一个新的群众性的西医学习中医的热潮。南京市的西医已百分之百的参加了中医学习，其他各市、县都纷纷提出保证要进一步广泛开展西医学习中医，各医学院、校内也普遍增加了中医课程，制订出了一套向中西合流发展的教学计划。全省要求在三、五年的时间内使所有的西医同时具有中医技术，为祖国创造新医学、跃居世界高峰创造条件。（朱冰菊）
    本报上海18日电　上海医务界最近普遍掀起西医学习中医的热潮，要求每个西医都学会中医的一般理论，掌握中西医两套技术。
    目前，全市各医院、诊所的医护人员都在学习针灸技术。榆林区的西医学会用“梅花针”针刺疗法治疗了高血压、风湿性疾病、神经衰弱症等病症，已治疗七百二十多个病例，有效率达到70％到100％。华东医院外科医师同中医师合作，用针灸治疗阑尾炎，许多弯腰捧腹进院的病人，施行针刺以后，很快即消除疼痛，炎症消退，白血球恢复正常，两三天内就回家了。现在这个医院对绝大多数阑尾炎病人采用针灸疗法，不再开刀，已治愈的有一百人。
    许多医院和医学院在学习中，还对怎样促进中西医合作展开了鸣放和辩论。辩论中，许多人用上海和全国各地中医创造的丰富成果，彻底驳倒了所谓“中医不科学”等企图否定中医的错误论点，并且明确认识到西医学习中医不是简单的西医疗法加中医疗法，而必须掌握中医的理论和技术，尤其是学习中医“辩证论治”的精神。上海第一医学院已为教师们开设了学习中医中药的夜大学。上海第二医学院的祖国医学课程已从原来五十四学时增加到一百学时，由中医师系统地讲授中医的理论知识，在中医研究班学习的五十九个西医，经过两年半的脱产学习，已写了一百八十篇学习中医理论和经验的论文，他们现在已在实习中开始运用中医的从整体出发、扶正违邪等原则治病。
    为了加速中西医合作，创造我国自己的医学派，上海中医学院、第一医学院、中国科学院生理研究所等部门的中西医都在合作整理中医临床经验，广泛搜集民间单方，进行系统研究。他们运用自制的经络测定器等仪器已找到了十二经络的许多穴位，初步掌握了一些经络的变化规律。许多研究，不仅证明经络学说不是虚构的空论，而且已提供了不少新的科学根据。
