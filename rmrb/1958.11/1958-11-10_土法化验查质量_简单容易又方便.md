Xinhua News Agency dispatch: "Indigenous assays" adapted to the needs of the mass steelmaking and ironmaking campaign have recently been successfully developed by the Anshan Iron and Steel Central Laboratory. With these indigenous methods, the local steel and iron produced by counties, townships, and communes can be tested and assessed on the spot. The test results can be used to improve techniques and enhance quality.

The equipment used for indigenous assays is very simple. It is not afraid of vibration or sunlight and can be used anywhere. The complete set of equipment includes a simple balance consisting of a one-foot-long number three steel wire, a graduated scale, and some subsidiary coins, several glass tubes of the same size, a triangular beaker, and a native stove. The chemicals used are also inexpensive and common. Such a laboratory can be set up for only five or six yuan. It can test the content of five main elements in steel and iron: carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus, and sulfur. The accuracy of the test is within the permissible error range.

The operation of the indigenous assay is very easy and does not require complicated calculations. For example, when testing the carbon content, simply load the standard sample with a known carbon content into a triangular beaker, add nitric acid, and heat it on the fire to dissolve it, then load it into a glass tube. Then weigh a certain amount of the test sample, dissolve it in the same way, load it into another glass tube, and add water for colorimetric comparison. When the solutions in the two tubes show exactly the same color, the carbon content of the test sample can be calculated using proportional algorithms. The testing methods for silicon, manganese, phosphorus, and sulfur are roughly the same. Therefore, anyone who knows ordinary multiplication and division can do it.

This testing method was successfully developed by the engineering and technical personnel of the Chemistry Section of the Anshan Iron and Steel Central Laboratory in two weeks of spare time. Now, they are preparing various standard samples for use throughout the country. An indigenous method for assaying ore will also be developed soon.

### 土法化验查质量  简单容易又方便

    土法化验查质量
    简单容易又方便
    新华社讯　适应全民炼钢炼铁需要的“土法化验”，最近由鞍钢中央试验室研究成功了。有了这种土办法，县、乡、社自己炼的土钢土铁，可以当场进行化验鉴定，根据化验结果来改进技术，提高质量。
    土法化验所用的设备十分简单，它们不怕震动，不怕阳光，随地可以使用。它的全套设备包括一个由一根一尺长的三号钢丝、一根克度尺和一些辅币组成的简易天秤，几个一样大的玻璃管，一个三角杯，一个土火炉；所用药品也都是价格便宜的普通药品。这样的化验室只需要五、六元钱就可以设立起来。它能够化验出钢铁中的碳、矽、锰、磷、硫等五种主要原素的含量，化验的准确程度都在允许的误差之内。
    土化验的操作非常容易，也不需要繁琐的计算。比如化验含碳成分时，只要把已知含碳量的标准样装进三角杯，加上硝酸，在火上加热溶解后装进玻璃管。再秤取一定重量的试样，用同样的方法溶解，装进另一根玻璃管，然后加水进行比色。等两管内溶液呈现出完全相同的颜色时，就可以运用比例的算法算出试样的含碳量。矽、锰、磷、硫的化验方法也大体相同。因此凡会普通乘除法的人都能做。
    这种化验方法是鞍钢中央试验室化学室的工程技术人员在两个星期内，用业余时间研究成功的。现在，他们正在准备各种标准样，供全国各地应用。还有一种化验矿石的土方法，也将很快研究成功。
