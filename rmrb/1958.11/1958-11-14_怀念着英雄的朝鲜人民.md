    After the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation returned to the capital of the motherland, during these glorious days, while being warmly welcomed by the people of the motherland, they were also filled with deep affection and remembrance for the heroic Korean people.

    The Korean people treated the Volunteer Army so well! They loved them like parents of the motherland, as close as their own brothers. During the long eight years, they gave the Volunteer Army soldiers, far away from their motherland, the warmth and care of relatives, and gave the soldiers tremendous encouragement and support. The victories and honors achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are inseparable from the heroic Korean people.

    When the song and dance revue "Volunteer Army Battle Song," performed by the Volunteer Army Art Troupe in Beijing, once again presented the heroic image of the Korean people bravely resisting the invaders in their suffering, and selflessly protecting and rescuing wounded Volunteer Army soldiers in the flames of war, our battle-hardened Volunteer Army generals couldn't help but shed tears of emotion on the spot. General Yan Jinsheng said: It is difficult for those who have not been to Korea to deeply understand how lovable the Korean people are! They are kind, honest, brave, and hardworking. We will always respect, admire, remember, and cherish them, and take their heroic qualities as a model for learning and as a force to consolidate and develop the great friendship between our two peoples of China and Korea.

    In these days since returning to the motherland, Lieutenant Colonel Wang Tong has deeply missed Kim Bong-gyo, the brave and kind Korean elder. This old warrior, who fought in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea for eight years, could not suppress the passion in his heart and has now raised his strong fighting hand to write chapters of Sino-Korean friendship. He said: "I want to spread the stories of the Korean people's love and support for us, and the noble internationalist virtues of the Korean people, to the people of the motherland and pass them on to future generations."

    The image of Korean elder Kim Bong-gyo is radiant and touching. When the Volunteer Army first went abroad to fight, he voluntarily ran to a reconnaissance unit led by Wang Tong, asking to be a "guide" to lead the Volunteer Army to victory. His house was bombed by American "air bandits," and his relatives were killed. His eyes were burning with anger. He showed extraordinary determination but also extraordinary optimism. He often sang and danced with the Volunteer Army soldiers, taught Korean, and learned Chinese, like a young soldier. The Volunteer Army soldiers affectionately called him "Abaji" (old man), and he regarded the soldiers as his own sons. In the cold winter nights, he covered the soldiers with his quilt; when there was not much fried noodles left, he tightened his belt and secretly saved the fried noodles for the soldiers to eat. Every time he carried out reconnaissance missions, he bravely and vigilantly walked in the front, stepping on the familiar land of his hometown, searching for secret narrow paths, and safely led the reconnaissance team to the heart of the enemy, ensuring the smooth completion of the reconnaissance mission. In particular, once, before the Volunteer Army was about to attack an important enemy position, the brave old man suddenly disappeared! The scouts were anxious for him and worried about him. But he had already ventured into the enemy's village at the risk of his life, conducting reconnaissance for two whole days and nights, clarifying everything about the enemy before happily returning to report to Lieutenant Colonel Wang Tong in detail. What important intelligence this was! The Volunteer Army immediately redeployed its battle plan based on the old man's report, made full preparations, and completely annihilated this enemy force that night, achieving a major victory.

    After recounting this vivid story, Lieutenant Colonel Wang Tong said with admiration and gratitude: "In Korea, there are thousands upon thousands of people like Kim Bong-gyo. It was with the full support of the Korean people that we achieved victory and honor in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Today, although we have left Korea and returned to the motherland, the great friendship and merits of the Korean people will never be forgotten by us."

    In the days since returning to Beijing, combat hero Wang Zhanshan has dreamed several times of an "Amani" (old woman) living near the distant 38th parallel. Her kind face and cheerful singing always touched the heart of this Chinese soldier. During the fierce Jincheng counterattack in the summer of 1953, Wang Zhanshan suffered serious injuries to his head, back, and legs. When he regained slight consciousness from his coma, he was already lying in an aid station not far from the front line, with a gray-haired Korean "Amani" sitting beside him, feeding him water and food. In the first few days, the severe pain of the wound caused him to moan from time to time. The "Amani" stroked his hand and shed sad tears. This made Wang Zhanshan feel the warmth of a mother's heart. In order not to make his mother sad, from then on, no matter how painful the wound was, Wang Zhanshan bit his teeth, until sweat dripped from his forehead, without moaning! The "Amani" really thought that the hero's wound had improved, and she immediately became happy. Every day, in addition to carefully feeding him water and food, she also danced and sang, comforting the soldier. More than ten days later, Wang Zhanshan's wound began to heal. Carrying his mother's warmth and encouragement, he returned to the front line and bravely defended the outpost of peace with his comrades. Now, this hero, wearing a Korean First-Class National Flag Medal on his chest, says with infinite emotion: "We don't know when we will be able to see these respectable Korean mothers again. Their great hearts will always warm and encourage us, and we will always care about the happiness of Korean mothers."

    After returning to the capital, the young car driver Liu Wenjing immediately sent a thank-you letter to the family of the Korean elder Kang Xueyong. In the letter, he reported that after returning to the motherland, he had seen the respected leader Chairman Mao and received a warm welcome from 200,000 people in the capital. "At this glorious and happy moment, I cannot help but think of the heroic Korean people's meticulous care and love for us during the eight years. Our glory should be attributed to the heroic Korean people." During his time in Korea, this heroic soldier had received the meticulous care and love of this ordinary family. The kind care of this ordinary Korean family brought them so much warmth and strength.

    怀念着英雄的朝鲜人民
    新华社记者　冶峰、丁固、姜庆肇
    中国人民志愿军代表团的官兵们回到祖国的首都以后，在这些光荣的日子里，他们在受到祖国人民热情欢迎的同时，也满怀着对英雄朝鲜人民的深情怀念。
    朝鲜人民对志愿军太好了！像祖国的父母一样爱，像自己的兄弟一样亲。在漫长的八年岁月中，他们给了远离祖国的志愿军战士们以亲人般的温暖和关怀，给了战士们以巨大的鼓舞和支援。中国人民志愿军所取得的胜利和荣誉，是同英雄的朝鲜人民分不开的。
    当志愿军文艺工作团在北京汇报演出的歌舞活报剧“志愿军战歌”中，又出现了朝鲜人民在苦难中英勇抗击侵略者，在战火中舍身爱护和抢救志愿军伤员的英雄形象时，我们的身经百战的志愿军将军们也禁不住当场流下了激动的眼泪。颜金生将军说：不到朝鲜的人，很难深刻地了解到朝鲜人民是多么可爱！他们善良忠厚，勇敢勤劳，我们永远敬爱着他们，感激着他们，怀念着他们，并且把他们的英雄品质，作为学习的榜样，作为巩固和发展我们中朝两国人民伟大友谊的力量。
    王统中校在回到祖国的这些日子里，一直深切地怀念着勇敢、慈祥的朝鲜老人金奉教。这位抗美援朝八年的老战士，压抑不住内心的激情，现在已经挥起了他那粗壮的战斗的手，写起中朝友谊的诗章来。他说：“我要把朝鲜人民热爱和支援我们的事迹，朝鲜人民崇高的国际主义美德，传颂给祖国人民，传留给子孙后代。”
    朝鲜老人金奉教的形象是光辉动人的。他在志愿军刚出国作战的时候，就自动地跑到王统率领的一支侦察部队里，要求当“响导”，好引导着志愿军胜利前进。他的房子被美国“空中强盗”炸光了，亲人被杀害了，他的眼睛被怒火烧红了，他表现得异常坚决，但也异常乐观。他经常同志愿军战士们一起唱歌跳舞，教朝鲜话，学中国话，好像一个年青的战士。志愿军战士们亲热地称他“阿巴基”（老大爷），他把战士们看作自己的儿子。在严寒的冬夜里，他把被子盖到战士的身上；在炒面不多了的时候，他勒紧腰带，偷偷地把炒面省下来，留给战士们吃。每次执行侦察任务的时候，他勇敢机警地走在前头，踏着熟悉的故乡土地，寻找着秘密的羊肠小道，把侦察队安全地带到敌人的心脏，保证顺利地完成侦察任务。特别是，有一次，在志愿军就要攻打敌人的一座重要阵地之前，突然这位勇敢的老人不见了！侦察员一方面为他焦急，一方面为他耽心。可是他已经冒着生命的危险，摸进了敌人的村庄，整整侦察了两昼夜，把敌人的一切情况都弄清楚了，才愉快地走回来，向王统中校详细地作了报告。这是多么重要的情报啊！志愿军部队马上根据老人的报告，重新部署了战斗，作了充分的准备，在当天夜晚，便全部歼灭了这股敌人，取得了重大胜利。
    王统中校在叙述了这个生动的故事之后，满怀着敬仰和感激的心情说：“在朝鲜，像金奉教这样的人，是千千万万的，我们就是在朝鲜人民这样全力的支援下，才取得了抗美援朝的胜利和荣誉。今天，我们虽然离别了朝鲜，回到了祖国，但是朝鲜人民的伟大友情和功德，将是我们永远也忘不了的。”
    战斗英雄王占山在回到北京的日子里，还几次梦见居住在遥远的“三八”线附近的一位“阿妈妮”（老大娘）。她那慈祥的面庞，爽朗的歌声，永远触动着这位中国战士的心。1953年夏天激烈的金城反击战中，王占山的头部、背部和两腿都受了重伤，当他从昏迷中稍微清醒过来时，已经躺在距离战线不远的救护所里，身旁坐着一位鬓发苍白的朝鲜“阿妈妮”，给他喂水喂饭。最初几天，伤口的剧痛使他发出时时的呻吟声，“阿妈妮”一边抚摸着他的手，一边流着难过的眼泪。这使王占山觉察到一颗温暖的母亲的心，为了不使母亲难过，从此，伤口再痛，王占山就咬住牙，直到额头上冒出汗珠，也不呻吟一声了！“阿妈妮”当真以为这位英雄战士的伤口好转了，便也马上高兴起来。每天，她除了细心地喂水喂饭以外，还又跳舞又唱歌，安慰着战士，十几天以后，王占山的伤口初愈，便带着母亲的温暖和鼓舞，重返前线，和战友们一起勇敢地坚守着和平的前哨阵地。现在，这位胸前佩带着朝鲜一级国旗勋章的英雄，怀着无限激念的心情说：“我们不知道什么时候再能看到这些可敬的朝鲜母亲了，她们的伟大的心将永远温暖和鼓舞着我们，我们也将永远关怀着朝鲜母亲的幸福。”
    年青的汽车驾驶员刘文敬在回到首都以后，马上就给朝鲜的康学永老人一家寄去了一封感谢信。他在信中报告了他在回到祖国以后见到了敬爱的领袖毛主席和受到首都二十万人民热烈欢迎的情形。“在这光荣幸福的时刻，我不能不想起英雄的朝鲜人民在八年中对我们无微不至的关怀和爱护。我们的光荣，应该归于英雄的朝鲜人民。”这位英雄的战士在朝鲜期间，曾经受到这个普通家庭的无微不至的关怀和热爱。这个普通的朝鲜家庭的亲切关怀，给他们带来了多少的温暖和力量。（附图片）
