Seventeen Veterinary Biological Products Reach International Level

(Our dispatch) Our country's veterinary science research work has achieved significant results. Materials gathered at the recent National On-site Conference on Prevention and Treatment of Rinderpest prove that seventeen of our country's veterinary biological products have reached international levels. Seven types, including the lapinized rinderpest vaccine using sheep, the lapinized rinderpest vaccine using goats, the attenuated rinderpest reaction vaccine, the lapinized attenuated hog cholera vaccine with bovine reaction, the sheep pox vaccine using chicken embryos, the lapinized attenuated hog cholera vaccine, and the hog cholera crystal violet vaccine, have surpassed world levels; the first five were created exclusively in our country.

The tremendous achievements of veterinary science research work have powerfully promoted our country's livestock production. In different regions, we have respectively used the lapinized rinderpest vaccine using goats, the lapinized rinderpest vaccine using sheep, and the attenuated rinderpest reaction vaccine to eliminate the devastating rinderpest that has been prevalent for thousands of years, seeing off the great plague god of cattle. The lapinized attenuated hog cholera vaccine, developed in 1956, is safe and effective, producing immunity within three or four days after injection, with an immunity period of up to one and a half years. At the same time, the manufacturing method is simple, the cost is low, and it can be produced locally. It has now been extended to more than 1,400 counties across the country, and some people's communes have established manufacturing plants for production. The newly developed sheep pox vaccine using chicken embryos has begun to be promoted on a large scale and has played a significant role in preventing and treating sheep pox.

    十七种兽医生物药品达到国际水平
    本报讯　我国兽医科学研究工作取得了重大的成就。最近召开的全国防治兽疫现场会议汇集的材料证明，我国已有十七种兽医生物药品达到国际水平。牛瘟绵羊化兔化疫苗、牛瘟山羊化兔化疫苗、牛瘟弱毒反应疫苗、猪瘟兔化弱毒牛体反应疫苗、羊痘鸡胚化疫苗、猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗、猪瘟结晶紫疫苗等七种超过了世界水平；前五种为我国所独创。
    兽医科学研究工作的巨大成果对我国畜牧业生产起了有力的推动作用。在不同地区我们分别使用牛瘟山羊化兔化疫苗、牛瘟绵羊化兔化疫苗、牛瘟弱毒反应疫苗消灭了流传几千年的具有毁灭性的牛瘟，送走了牛的大瘟神。1956年培育成的猪瘟兔化弱毒安全有效，注射后三、四天内即产生免疫力，免疫期长达一年半之久，同时制造方法简便，成本低廉，并可以就地生产。现已推广到全国一千四百多个县，有些人民公社已建立了制造厂进行制造。新制成的羊痘鸡胚化疫苗，已开始大面积推广，在防治羊痘上已起到重大的作用。
