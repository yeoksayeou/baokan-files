Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 19th: The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized an urban-rural commercial collaboration group to go deep into the countryside to help arrange the peak season supply of materials, promoting closer urban-rural collaboration and smoother urban-rural material exchange.

The collaboration group was formed in mid-October and included more than 200 cadres. They went deep into the countryside to understand the market changes and dynamics after the communization, adjusted the distribution of goods, and helped various counties tap production potential to meet the needs of rural areas for means of production and means of livelihood. The collaboration group found in Xifeng County that the local cotton clothing processing capacity was insufficient, and the supply of cotton clothing could not keep up. If this was not resolved, it would affect the autumn harvest, deep plowing, and the large-scale steel industry. Therefore, they transferred 3,000 sets of cotton clothing from Shenyang to supply Xifeng. For materials needed by both urban and rural areas, the collaboration group, following the principle of giving priority to supplying rural areas, transferred goods from the supply of Shenyang City to rural areas.

The collaboration group helped various counties establish more than a dozen small factories producing cotton shoes, cardboard,麻袋 (ma dai - sacks), and knitwear, enabling some of the most urgently needed materials in various places to be manufactured and supplied locally.

Some materials are in great demand in rural areas, but the supply of goods is insufficient in both urban and rural areas. The collaboration group helped various places to find ways to solve the problem with substitutes. For example, counties need a lot of bamboo and iron rings for drilling deep wells, but the supply of these materials is insufficient. The collaboration group studied from other places and researched with local farmers, using miscellaneous wood to replace bamboo and wooden rings to replace iron rings.

The collaboration group helped rural areas solve many material supply problems, and various counties also expressed their intention to supply Shenyang City with more non-staple foods, thereby further strengthening urban-rural collaboration.

    城乡协作促进物资畅流
    沈阳组织商业协作团帮助农村安排旺季供应工作
    据新华社沈阳19日电　中共沈阳市委组织城乡商业协作团，深入农村帮助安排旺季物资供应工作，促使城乡协作进一步密切和城乡物资交流畅通。
    协作团是在10月中旬组成的，包括二百多名干部。他们深入农村了解公社化后市场的变化和动态，调整商品的摆布，帮助各县挖掘生产潜力，满足农村对生产资料和生活资料的需要。协作团在西丰县发现当地棉服加工能力不足，棉服供应不上，如果不解决，就会影响秋收、深翻和大办钢铁工业，于是从沈阳拨出三千套棉服供应西丰。协作团对城乡都需要的物资，按照尽先供应农村的原则，从供应沈阳市的货物中拨调农村。
    协作团帮助各县建立了十几个生产棉鞋、板纸、麻袋和针织品等产品的小工厂，使各地最急需的一些物资能够就地制造就地供应。
    有些物资农村很需要，但城乡货源都不足，协作团就帮助各地设法用代用品解决。如各县打深井需要大量竹子和铁圈，而这些物资货源不足。协作团一面向外地学习，同时和当地农民研究，用杂木代替竹子，用木圈代替铁圈。
    协作团帮助农村解决了许多物资供应上的问题，各县也表示要以更多的副食品供应沈阳市，从而更加密切了城乡协作。
