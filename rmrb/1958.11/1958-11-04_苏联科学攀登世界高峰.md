    Soviet Science Climbs to the World's Summit

    The Great October Socialist Revolution opened up unprecedentedly broad avenues for the development of Soviet science.

    In the past forty-one years, Soviet scientific endeavors have advanced by leaps and bounds, and currently hold the world's leading position in a series of major scientific fields. The achievements of Soviet mathematicians, physicists, chemists, experts in aerodynamics, metallurgy, instrument manufacturing, and other scientific and technological departments can prove this point.

    Intercontinental Ballistic Rockets and Artificial Earth Satellites

    In 1957, the Soviet Union was the first in the world to launch an ultra-long-range intercontinental multi-stage ballistic rocket and an artificial Earth satellite. Later, Soviet experts launched two more artificial Earth satellites. The third artificial satellite weighed about one and a half tons. The launch of artificial Earth satellites laid the foundation for mankind's conquest of outer space.

    Atomic Power Stations and Atomic Icebreakers

    The Soviet Union built the world's first atomic power station, which began generating electricity in June 1954. The first phase of a new atomic power station with a total generating capacity of 600,000 kilowatts was also recently completed. This first phase has a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. The Soviet Union is continuing to expand the scope of the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet Union is about to finalize the construction of the world's first atomic icebreaker, and radioactive isotopes are being widely used in scientific research and various sectors of the national economy.

    Specialized Personnel and Scientific Research Institutions

    The Soviet Union now has approximately 7.5 million specialized personnel with higher and secondary professional education, which is thirty-five times more than in pre-revolutionary Russia. In 1914, Russia had a total of only two hundred and eighty-nine scientific institutions and just over ten thousand scientific workers. At the beginning of this year, the Soviet Union already had about three thousand scientific institutions and more than two hundred and sixty thousand scientific workers, of whom about one hundred thousand have doctoral or associate doctoral degrees.

    The training of specialized personnel in the Soviet Union is improving year by year. In the past year alone, institutions of higher and secondary professional education have trained more than seven hundred and seventy thousand specialized personnel. There are more than two million students in institutions of higher education.

    As everyone knows, the United States is now very eager to catch up with the Soviet Union in expert training. Recently, the Soviet Union decided to reform secondary and higher education, which will further improve the level of talent training.

    苏联科学攀登世界高峰
    伟大的十月社会主义革命为苏联科学的发展打开了空前广阔的道路。
    四十一年来，苏联的科学事业突飞猛进，目前已在一系列主要科学领域方面获得了世界第一的地位。苏联数学家，物理学家，化学家，空气动力学、冶金、仪器制造以及其他科学技术部门专家的成就，就可以证明这一点。
    洲际弹道火箭和人造地球卫星
    1957年苏联在世界上第一个发射了超远程洲际多级弹道火箭，人造地球卫星。后来苏联专家们又发射了两个人造地球卫星。其中第三个人造卫星约重一吨半。人造地球卫星的发射奠定了人类征服宇宙空间的开端。
    原子能发电站和原子能破冰船
    苏联建成了世界上第一个原子能发电站，这个发电站在1954年6月开始发电。一个全部发电能力达六十万瓩的新原子能发电站的第一期工程也在不久前竣工。这一期工程的发电能力即达到十万瓩。苏联在继续扩大和平利用原子能范围。苏联即将最后完成世界上第一艘原子能破冰船的建造工作，科学研究以及国民经济各个部门都在广泛利用放射性同位素。
    专门人材和科学研究机构
    苏联现在约有七百五十万受过高等和中等专业教育的专门人材，比革命前的俄国多了三十五倍。1914年俄国一共只有二百八十九个科学机构，科学工作者的人数才一万多一点。在今年年初，苏联已经拥有约三千个科学机构和二十六万以上的科学工作者，其中约有十万人有博士或副博士的学位。
    苏联专门人材的培养工作一年比一年提高。仅在去年一年，高等和中等专业学校就培养出了七十七万以上的专门人材。高等学校学生人数在两百万以上。
    大家知道，美国现在非常急于在专家培养工作上赶上苏联。最近苏联决定改革中等和高等学校，这将使人材培养工作的水平更加提高。
