Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 17th. The "King of Open-Hearth Furnaces"—a fixed open-hearth furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel—which was recently put into production, has begun to show its power over the past half-month, with steadily increasing output. Since the furnace produced its first heat of steel on October 31st, it had produced 13,367 tons of steel by the 15th, with a utilization coefficient of 9.4. On the 15th alone, it produced more than 1,200 tons of steel, with a utilization coefficient of 13.2.

When this open-hearth furnace was first put into production, the steelworkers lacked experience in operating such a large furnace, and the basic construction of another large open-hearth furnace was underway nearby, creating many difficulties in production. For example, only one of the two slag outlets could be used, which affected the smelting time. However, the steelworkers were determined to overcome these difficulties. They broke down the boundaries between shifts and strengthened unity among the four shifts. Party branch secretary Liu Mingzhan and furnace chief Yu Guichen, among others, stayed by the furnace day and night to direct production. They worked alongside the workers to operate and maintain the furnace, and they organized workers to exchange experiences, which quickly improved the technical level of all workers in the furnace, familiarized them with the operating characteristics of large open-hearth furnaces, and continuously improved production levels. According to the design capacity, the smelting time for each heat of steel from this furnace is fourteen hours, but it has now reached ten hours and fifteen minutes. The charging amount has also increased from more than 500 tons to more than 600 tons, approaching the highest revised design level.

Recently, the workers at this open-hearth furnace have also launched a multi-skilled worker campaign. Steelworkers must not only be able to make steel, but also be able to maintain the furnace. This not only ensures the continuous improvement of open-hearth furnace production levels, but also cultivates a group of talents who can fully master large open-hearth furnaces.

### 鞍钢“平炉之王”显出威力

    鞍钢“平炉之王”显出威力
    新华社鞍山17日电　新投入生产的“平炉之王”——鞍钢一座固定式平炉，半个月来已初步显出它的威力，产量逐步上升。这座平炉自10月31日炼出第一炉钢以来，到15日已经出钢一万三千三百六十七吨，利用系数达到九点四；其中15日一天就生产了一千二百多吨钢，利用系数达到十三点二。
    这座平炉刚投入生产的时候，由于炼钢工人没有操纵这样大的平炉的经验，加上另一座大型平炉的基本建设工程正在旁边进行，生产上存在着不少困难。如两个出渣口中，只有一个能出渣，这样就影响熔炼时间。但是炼钢工人们决心要克服这些困难。他们冲破了交接班的界限，加强了四班团结；支部书记刘名占和炉长余贵臣等人，白天黑夜守在炉旁指挥生产，他们一面与工人共同操作、维护炉体，一面组织工人交流经验，使全炉工人很快提高了技术水平，熟悉了大型平炉的操作特点，使生产水平不断提高。按照设计能力，这座炉子每炉钢的熔炼时间是十四小时，但是现在已经达到十小时十五分。装入量也由五百多吨扩大到六百多吨，接近了修改后的最高的设计水平。
    最近，这座平炉的工人还开展了多面手运动。炼钢工不仅要能炼钢，还要能护炉。这样，不仅保证平炉生产水平不断地提高，也培养了一批能全面掌握大型平炉的人材。
