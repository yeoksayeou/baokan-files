The policy of combining education with productive labor has blossomed and borne fruit in various schools. The "Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor," which opened in Beijing today, serves as a mirror reflecting the achievements in this area. According to statistics from the exhibition, more than 20,000 secondary and higher education institutions across the country have established more than 150,000 factories and more than 10,000 farms. The factories run by schools across the country will produce 1.58 million tons of steel, 36,600 machine tools, and 1.93 million tons of fertilizer by the end of this year. The following are new products manufactured by teachers and students in labor and scientific research. (Attached pictures)

    党的教育方针结出丰硕之果
    教育与生产劳动相结合方针，已经在各个学校中开花结果。今天在北京开幕的“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”像一面镜子，反映了这方面的成就。根据展览会上的统计，全国两万多个中等以上的学校已开办了十五万多个工厂和一万多个农场。全国各地学校办的工厂，将在今年年底以前生产钢铁一百五十八万吨、机床三万六千六百台、肥料一百九十三万吨。下面便是学校师生在劳动中和科学研究中制造的新产品。（附图片）
