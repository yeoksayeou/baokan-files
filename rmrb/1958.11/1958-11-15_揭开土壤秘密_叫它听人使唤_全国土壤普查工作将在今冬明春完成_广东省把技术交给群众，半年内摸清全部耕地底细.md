Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 14th: The national on-site conference on soil survey work held in Xinxing County, Guangdong Province, calls on all localities to combine the current winter and spring deep plowing and soil improvement movement to complete the national soil survey and identification work, so as to adapt to the people's communes' comprehensive and rational utilization of land and the requirements of less planting, high yield, and more harvest.

The conference was jointly convened by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Land Utilization Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture. It was attended by more than 320 responsible cadres, experts, professors, and researchers from scientific research institutions and agricultural administrative departments in 26 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. During the conference from October 21st to November 5th, the representatives visited Xinxing, Yunfu, Guangning, Sihui, Xinhui, Nanhai and other six counties in Guangdong Province to learn from the experience of carrying out mass soil survey work, and exchanged experiences from various provinces. At the end of the meeting, Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, gave a summary report.

The meeting believes that immediately carrying out mass soil survey and identification work nationwide is a necessary measure to ensure that people's communes achieve less planting, high yield, more harvest, and comprehensive utilization of land resources. From the new situation in our country where people's communes have been realized and agricultural production is developing towards large-scale, high-yield, and bumper harvests, it has become an urgent demand of the masses to unlock the secrets of the soil and make the land obey human command. At present, all parts of the country are preparing to gradually implement the "three-three system" and "gardenization" of farmland planting, a major transformation in agricultural production. Various localities have decided to launch a large-scale high-yield satellite field movement next year, requiring unit area yield to increase at a rate of several times. Therefore, it is currently very necessary to carry out soil survey and identification nationwide. Through soil survey and identification, we can ascertain the soil quality and characteristics of various types of cultivated land, so as to formulate deep plowing indicators according to the depth of the soil layer; propose various improvement measures according to soil quality; apply fertilizers rationally according to different soils, continuously improve soil fertility, transform low-yield into high-yield, and make high-yield even higher; as well as leveling land, mastering the adaptability of soil to mechanized farming, and adjusting irrigation and drainage systems. At the same time, with leaders and the masses having a clear understanding of the soil, they will dare to reform farming techniques more boldly.

Who should we rely on to carry out soil surveys? Through on-the-spot observations and mutual exchange of experiences in Guangdong Province, the representatives deeply realized that the past approach of relying on a few technical cadres to contract for piecemeal soil surveys is far from meeting the needs of the current rapid development of production. Only by relying on the broad masses and handing over technology to the masses to carry out mass soil surveys can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. Guangdong Province piloted the work in March this year and only fully launched the soil survey in August. Because it relied on the masses and adopted the method of "soil-based, combining indigenous and foreign methods," it basically completed the soil survey work of the entire province within six months, while training a large number of farmer technicians, enabling the survey results to quickly play a role in production. The experience of various localities also shows that mass learning of soil survey technology should focus on on-site practice and supplemented by lectures. As long as the principles of popularizing scientific terms, unifying farmer terminology, and making lectures vivid are implemented, the broad masses of farmers can quickly master soil survey technology. The representatives saw in Yuejin Commune, Nanhai County, that men, women, old and young in this commune have mastered the rapid determination technology of analyzing soil acidity and alkalinity and effective nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil, which is used to guide deep plowing and soil improvement and layered fertilization.

The meeting also believes that soil survey work must be carried out in combination with investigation, planning, and implementation, so as to closely serve current production. After the masses in many areas of Guangdong Province conducted profile surveys themselves and found that cultivated land had a hardening phenomenon due to the past blind application of lime, they immediately took improvement measures, thus rapidly increasing production.

The meeting emphasized that to complete mass soil survey work nationwide in the current winter and spring, the most important thing is to put politics in command and have the secretary take action.

This newspaper reports: Guangdong Province relies on the masses to carry out soil surveys, and has basically ascertained the details of all cultivated land in the province in only half a year, and has quickly played a role in production.

Under the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, the past method of relying solely on a few technical cadres to contract for soil surveys and "field investigations, laboratory tests" is far from meeting the needs of rapid development in production. Starting in March this year, Guangdong Province carried out soil survey work by adopting the policy of "relying on the masses, combining indigenous and foreign methods, closely combining with production, and surveying while improving." The province's technical teams established pilot projects and held short-term training courses in each special district and county, handing over technology to the masses, adopting methods of lecturing in the fields, on-site practice, and learning while doing, training cadres at all levels, and cultivating a large number of farmer technicians. By summarizing the experience of the pilot projects and organizing visits and comparisons, the masses personally saw that the measures taken after the survey immediately took effect in production, and they paid more attention to carrying out soil surveys, regarding it as "looking at the land, taking its pulse, and treating its diseases," thereby promoting the rapid progress of this work. After the comprehensive launch from point to surface in August, the soil survey work in 120 counties and cities throughout the province has been basically completed.

After ascertaining the characteristics and soil layer thickness of various types of cultivated land, various localities have successively begun to carry out soil transformation and rational fertilization, avoiding blindness. Some past situations where fertilization was improper or crop planting arrangements were inappropriate due to not mastering soil performance well were also corrected in a timely manner. Many areas have reasonably transformed the terrain according to the survey results, done a good job in soil and water conservation based on rainfall and slope, turned sloping land into terraces, turned barren mountains into orchards, and a comprehensive plan for the soil's adaptability to mechanized farming has also begun.

This mass soil survey movement, after handing over technology to the masses, not only resulted in faster speed and more surveyed strata, but more importantly, the large number of farmer technicians who have grown up (nearly 100,000 farmer technicians have been trained in six special districts alone) immediately applied scientific knowledge to production after mastering it, closely guiding production and promoting the development of production. Some past arguments that farmers could not survey soil maps or understand laboratory work have also been broken by the facts. The experience of various localities proves that the native farmers are very familiar with the local terrain and soil distribution, and the soil map boundaries drawn are clear and detailed, and even a small field can be clearly seen on the map at a glance, and it is easy to see and practical. After short-term training and exercise in actual work, the broad masses of farmer technicians have mastered the rapid determination technology of soil acidity and alkalinity and effective nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

Soil survey is both a technical, political, and mass-based work. It must be closely combined with the center of production, and all relevant departments must cooperate closely. The experience of Guangdong Province proves that the attention and support of party and government leaders at all levels is a guarantee for the smooth completion of this work. (Zheng Shiwen)

    揭开土壤秘密  叫它听人使唤
    全国土壤普查工作将在今冬明春完成
    广东省把技术交给群众，半年内摸清全部耕地底细
    新华社广州14日电　在广东省新兴县举行的全国土壤普查工作现场会议，要求各地在今冬明春结合深耕改良土壤运动，完成全国土壤普查鉴定工作，以适应人民公社全面合理利用土地和实现少种、高产、多收的要求。
    会议由中国农业科学院、农业部土地利用总局联合召开，出席的有二十六个省、市、自治区的科学研究机构和农业行政部门的负责干部、专家、教授、研究员等三百二十多人。在10月21日到11月5日的会议期间，代表们曾分别到广东省的新兴、云浮、广宁、四会、新会、南海等六县参观，学习开展群众性土壤普查工作经验，并互相交流了各省的经验。会议结束时，农业部副部长刘瑞龙作了总结报告。
    会议认为，在全国范围内立即开展群众性的土壤普查鉴定工作，是保证人民公社实现少种、高产、多收和综合利用土地资源的必要措施。从我国已经实现人民公社化、农业生产向大面积高额丰产方向发展的新形势来看，揭开土壤的秘密，叫土地听人使唤已经成了群众的迫切要求。目前，全国各地都在准备逐步实行农田种植“三三制”和“园田化”的农业生产大变革。各地已决定明年开展大面积的高产卫星试验田运动，要求单位面积产量以数倍计的速度增长。因此，目前在全国开展土壤普查鉴定是十分必要的。通过土壤普查鉴定，摸清各类型耕地的土质、特性，才能按土层深浅订出深耕指标；分别土质提出各种改良措施；根据不同土壤合理施肥，不断提高地力，变低产为高产，让高产更高产；以及平整土地，掌握土壤对机械化耕作的适应性和调整排灌系统。同时，领导与群众对土壤心中有数，才敢于更大胆地改革耕作技术。
    依靠谁来开展土壤普查？代表们在广东省实地观察和互相交流经验中深刻体会到：过去依靠少数技术干部包办作零敲碎打的土壤调查的道路，已远不能适应当前生产飞跃发展的需要。只有依靠广大群众、把技术交给群众来开展群众性的土壤普查，才能做到多快好省。广东省今年3月试点，8月才全面开展土壤普查，由于依靠群众，采取“以土为主、土洋结合”的方法，前后半年内便基本完成全省土壤普查工作，同时培养出大批农民技术员，使普查结果迅速在生产上发挥了作用。各地的经验也表明：群众学习土壤普查技术应以现场实习为主、以讲课为辅，只要贯彻执行科学名词通俗化、农民用语统一化和讲课形象化，广大农民就能很快掌握土壤普查技术。代表们在南海县跃进公社看到，这个社的男女老幼都已掌握了分析土壤酸碱度和土壤中有效氮、磷、钾的速测技术，用来指导深耕改土和分层施肥。
    会议还认为：土壤普查工作必须边调查、边规划、边实施结合进行，以达到紧密为当前生产服务的目的。广东省许多地区经过群众自己作剖面调查，查出耕地由于过去盲目施用石灰造成板结现象后，立即采取改良措施，因而迅速提高了产量。
    会议强调指出：要在今冬明春在全国范围内完成群众性的土壤普查工作，最重要的是政治挂帅，书记动手。
    本报讯　广东省依靠群众开展土壤普查，仅花半年时间已基本摸清全省耕地底细，并迅速在生产上发挥作用。
    在农业生产大跃进的形势下，过去仅靠少数技术干部包办土壤普查和“野外调查、化验室化验”的方法已远不能适应生产飞跃发展的需要。今年3月开始，广东省开展土壤普查工作是采取“依靠群众、土洋结合、紧密结合生产、边普查边改良”的方针进行的。全省技术队伍分别在各专县建立试点和举办短期训练班，将技术交给群众，采取田头讲课、现场实习、边学边做的办法，逐级培训干部，培养大量农民技术员。通过总结试点的经验，组织参观评比，群众亲自见到普查后所采取的措施在生产上马上见效，对开展土壤普查更重视了，将它看成是“给耕地看相、摸脉医病”，从而推动这一工作迅速进行。由8月份开始以点带面的全面铺开后，全省一百二十个县市的土壤普查工作已基本完成。
    各地摸清了各类耕地的特性、土层厚度后，已先后开始进行土壤改造和合理施肥，避免了盲目性。一些过去因没掌握好土壤性能而施肥不当或农作物种植安排不当的也及时得到改正。许多地区按照普查结果已合理地改造了地形，根据降雨量、坡度做好了水土保持，将坡地变成梯田，把荒山变成花果山，对机械化耕作的土壤适应性也开始全面规划。
    这次开展群众性的土壤普查运动，把技术交给群众后，不仅速度快、调查的地层多，更重要的是大量成长起来的农民技术员（仅六个专区就训练出近十万名农民技术员）掌握科学知识后立即运用到生产上去，紧密指导生产和推动生产的发展。过去一些认为农民群众不能测绘土壤图、不懂化验工作的论调也被事实所击破。各地的经验证明：土生土长的农民对本地区的地形、土壤分布了如指掌，测绘出来的土壤图界线清楚细致，连小小一丘田都能在图上一目了然，而且易看实用。经过短期训练和在实际工作中锻炼，广大农民技术员已掌握了土壤酸碱度和有效养分——氮、磷、钾的速测技术。
    土壤普查既是技术性而又是政策性和群众性的工作，既要紧密结合生产中心，又要各有关部门通力协作，广东省经验证明，各级党政领导的重视和支持是顺利完成这项工作的保证。　　（郑世文）
