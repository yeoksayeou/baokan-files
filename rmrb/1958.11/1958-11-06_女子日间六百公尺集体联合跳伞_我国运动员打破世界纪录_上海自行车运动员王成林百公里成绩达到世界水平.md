    (Reported by this newspaper) Our excellent female parachute jumpers Li Shuhua, Cui Xiuying, and Li Shuhui broke the world record for women's daytime 600-meter group combined parachute jump during a parachute performance at Liangxiang Airport in Beijing on the morning of the 5th. Their distances from the target center point were 3.37 meters, 15.95 meters, and 17.86 meters, respectively, with an average distance from the target center point of 12.39 meters. The previous world record was set by Soviet female athletes in 1955, with a score of 21 meters from the target center.
    This parachute performance was held by the Aviation Club of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to welcome General Belov, Chairman of the Voluntary Association for Assistance to the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Soviet Union. General Belov was very pleased to witness the outstanding achievements of our parachute jumpers. He shook hands with Li Shuhua and others, congratulating them on their achievements, and presented each of them with a commemorative medal.
    (Reported by this newspaper) Shanghai cyclist athletes held a men's 100-kilometer road cycling race on the 4th. Excellent athlete Wang Chenglin won the championship with an excellent time of 2 hours, 18 minutes, 59.4 seconds.
