    A Visit to the Steel Base
    By our reporters Li Yifang and Lu Chaoqi
          On the Way to the Base
    At eight o'clock on the morning of October 25th, we boarded a train from Nanning to Pingxiang, heading to the Steel Command Headquarters of Ningming County.

    Ningming borders Vietnam and is not far from the Friendship Pass. It takes six hours by train from Nanning. In the north, it's almost time to light the stoves, but in Guangxi, it's a season of clear skies and refreshing air, although still scorching hot during the day. Along both sides of the railway, undulating hills rise and fall. On the low slopes, we often saw patches of mosquito nets and bedsheets fluttering in the wind. These were the campsites for teams heading up the mountains to make steel, dig coal, or cut wood.

    Upon arriving in Ningming, we were surprised to find that the Steel Command Headquarters had already moved to the Tingliang Steel Base, sixty miles away. Most of the people from the county seat had also gone to the Tingliang Steel Base, and even the bicycles that used to carry passengers were gone. We decided to seek help from the County Party Committee. Stepping into the courtyard of the County Party Committee, we were astonished: almost all the offices and dormitories were closed and locked. We finally found a comrade in the mail room, the only person left at the County Party Committee to watch the buildings and forward documents. He apologized and explained that there were no bicycles available, and the only option was to contact the train station and take the freight train at night. We accepted his suggestion, had dinner at the public canteen in the city, and headed towards the station. As soon as we arrived at the station, we saw a freight train arriving from Pingxiang. The station dispatcher said that according to regulations, this train would not stop at Tingliang Station. However, he enthusiastically helped us contact the driver, saying that there were two "important" figures going to the Steel Base, and requested the train to make an exception and stop at Tingliang for one minute. The driver comrade, upon hearing that someone was going to the Steel Base, agreed without hesitation. "Fighting for Steel" has indeed become the center of life here, and the most solemn cause in people's minds!
            The Sleepless Valley
    We arrived at Tingliang close to eight o'clock. The base is close to the railway, with iron ore, limestone, coal, and timber. If the resource reserves are indeed substantial, this is an ideal base for a steel enterprise. The Nanning Prefectural Committee and the Ningming County Committee of the Communist Party of China only decided to develop this base on October 15th. By the 25th, more than 26,000 people had gathered, power plants and telephone switchboards were installed on the mountain, and department stores, hospitals, and post offices had also sent people. All kinds of vehicles had arrived. This is a mountainous area, with a single commune spanning one to two hundred li. There were no cars or boats, and people relied on their own two legs to get around. Once the Party's call was issued and the goal was set, tens of thousands of people, carrying bedding and tools, trekked over mountains and rivers.

    A military system and combat readiness are being implemented here. Units below the regiment level are divided into battalions, companies, platoons, and squads. Bugles are blown to wake people up, whistles are blown to assemble, and working, resting, sleeping, and eating are all collective activities. People eat in the wind and sleep in the dew. The temporary County Committee is housed in a thatched shed of about forty square meters, with two large flags planted at the entrance. One flag reads: Ningming Heroes Division Command; the other reads: Nanning Prefectural Committee Directly Subordinate Organs, Schools Steel Field Army Headquarters. In the middle of the shed are two sets of office tables, three telephones, ore samples, steel samples from various regiments' trials, and teapots, all crowded onto the tables. On both sides of the shed are beds, some with wooden boards, some with thatched grass, and some simply on the ground.

    On the hills surrounding the headquarters, thatched sheds are everywhere. Late at night, we walked past the thatched sheds and saw that most of the beds were empty. In a mountain pass, there was a large kiln, more than two zhang in diameter and almost three zhang deep. On both sides of the kiln were two large trees with their branches already cut off, and two electric lights hung on the trees. At the bottom of the kiln, people were repairing the ventilation ducts and the kiln door. The ore and firewood around the kiln were almost piled up to the top of the mountain, but the streams of people carrying ore and firewood continued to flow from the small paths on both sides of the mountain. Comrade Qu Yicheng, the Party Secretary of the Hongqi People's Commune—the Ninth Regiment of the Heroes Division—told us that this large kiln was built in collaboration with the Munan People's Commune, the Haiyuan People's Commune, the Daxin County Steel Corps, the Nanning Prefectural Committee directly subordinate colleges and universities, and themselves. The Daxin Steel Corps, with more than 2,000 people, was responsible for transporting ore. This corps only arrived at the construction site on the night of the 23rd. They didn't even have time to build their sleeping sheds and threw themselves into the battle the next morning.

    On another hillside, eight kilns had already been lit. Each kiln door had a person specifically responsible for adding firewood and watching the fire, and there were nearly a hundred people next to each kiln. Some were crushing ore, and some were cutting long logs into short logs, constantly adding them to the top of the kiln. This was the iron smelting kiln in charge of the Eighth Company of the Gongmushan People's Commune. The company commander was a twenty-five-year-old young woman named Zou Haijin. She skillfully directed others to start the fire, as if she were an experienced smelter. However, she told us that she had never seen a smelting furnace before, and didn't even know what iron ore looked like.
          Daughters Can Outperform Sons
    The large number of women is one of the characteristics of the Tingliang Steel Base. In general companies, women account for about one-third, and in some, they account for more than half. Women in Guangxi have always been known for their agricultural labor. This time, on the steel front, they are no different from men, carrying ore when needed, carrying wood when needed, cutting trees when needed, mining when needed, firing kilns when needed, staying up all night when needed, and enduring rain when needed, without any less effort than men. The Gongmushan People's Commune had a young woman named Zeng Rongzhen, who challenged the battalion commander and all the men to compete in carrying weight, enduring for a longer time, and walking faster. Carrying ore, she could carry seven loads a day over a distance of twelve li, with each load weighing at least eighty or ninety jin, sometimes more than a hundred jin. Swinging a sledgehammer to mine ore, men had to be replaced several times in one night, but she could persist until dawn. The Bangun People's Commune—the Sixth Company of the Sixth Regiment of the Heroes Division—had a women's satellite furnace (kiln), staffed by ten women. There was a soldier named Li Guanying, a Party member, who was forty-eight years old, and people called her "Old Mama." Once, during the first firing of the furnace tested by the secretary, there was heavy rain. People saw that she was old and told her to go back to take shelter from the rain, but she insisted on staying and pulling the bellows with the men. Her clothes were wet, and she was told to go back and change, but she refused, saying, "I won't go back until I see the molten iron flowing out! I'll just dry them here, and the clothes will dry."

    There is a mountain song sung by a man and a woman, describing a couple competing in enthusiasm at the Steel Base. This song goes like this:

    Woman sings: To eat dragon meat, you must first go to the sea,
    　　　　　To capture a fierce tiger, you must go up the mountain;
    　　　　　Complete the steel task by the end of the month,
    　　　　　Let everyone take on the glorious task.

    Man sings: The light of the stars is not as good as the moon,
    　　　　　Serving tea and rice is not as good as soup;
    　　　　　Eighteen-year-olds (note: later generations refer to young people) are ambitious,
    　　　　　Dare to take on heavy burdens.

    Woman sings: Don't say that men are heroic,
    　　　　　Daughters can outperform sons;
    　　　　　Iron mountains must also bow down,
    　　　　　Ore must be turned into steel.

    The leading comrades of each regiment and company always express joy and pride when talking about their soldiers. They say, "We are all upstream people here, at least midstream people."

    Indeed, it is worth being proud because these people are all selected from the communes. Comrade Li Futian, the regiment commander of the Daxin Steel Corps, said that the slogan of taking steel as the key link has driven the enthusiasm of everyone. For more than a month, the Daxin Steel Corps has been fighting along the Zuojiang River, first digging coal in Fusui County, then moving to Chongzuo County to build indigenous blast furnaces, then to Longjin County to burn charcoal, and finally moving to Tingliang to build large kilns. Each transfer is hundreds of miles, all on foot, and the masses have no objections, and they are as swift as the army, setting off in full force two hours after receiving the order. Comrade Li Futian finally said: "With such people, the mountains will collapse when shaken, and the ground will flatten when stepped on. What difficulties can stop us from moving forward?"

    钢铁基地见闻
    本报记者　李益芳　陆超祺
          去基地的路上
    10月25日上午八点，我们坐上从南宁开往凭祥的火车，去宁明县钢铁指挥部。
    宁明和越南接壤，离睦南关不远，从南宁坐火车要六小时。在北方，现在已经快生火炉了，但在广西正是天高气爽的季节，白天还是很灼热的。铁路两旁山峦起伏，在低矮的山坡上，时时看见一片一片的蚊帐和被单随风飘动。这是上山炼铁、挖煤或砍木材的队伍的露营地。
    到了宁明，不料这里的钢铁指挥部已经搬到六十里以外的钢铁基地——亭亮去了。县城的人大都也到亭亮钢铁基地去了，原来有搭客的自行车也去了。我们决定到县委会想办法。走进县委会的院子，很使我们惊讶：几乎所有的办公室和宿舍都已关窗锁门，好容易才在收发室里找到一位同志，是县委会唯一留下来看房子和收转文件的人。他很抱歉地给我们解释说，自行车没有了，唯一办法就是跟火车站联系，乘晚上的货车去。我们接受他的建议，在城里公共食堂吃罢晚饭，就往车站走。刚到车站，就看见从凭祥开来一列货车。车站值班员说，照规定，这一列车在亭亮站是不停的。不过他很热心地帮我们与司机联系，说有两位“重要”人物要去钢铁基地，请列车破例在亭亮停一分钟。司机同志听说有人去钢铁基地，就毫不犹豫地答应了。“为钢铁而战”，确实成为这里的生活中心，成为人们心目中最庄严的事业了！
            不眠的山谷
    到亭亮，快八点钟了。基地紧靠铁路，有铁矿、有石灰石、有煤，又有木材。如果资源储量确实不低的话，这儿是个理想的钢铁企业基地。中共南宁地委和宁明县委在10月15日才决定开发这个基地，到25日，集结的队伍已经有二万六千多人，发电厂、电话总机都上了山，百货商店、医院、邮局也都派了人来。各种车辆都来了。这里是山区，一个公社纵横一、二百里，没有汽车，没有船，一动就靠两条腿。党的号召一出，前进的目标一定，数以万计的群众就挑着被服工具，翻山涉水而来。
    这里实行军事化和战斗化。团以下分营、连、排、班，吹号起床，吹哨集合，干活、休息、睡觉、吃饭都是集体行动。风餐露宿。临时县委会设在一个约四十平方公尺的草棚里，门口插着两面大旗。一面写着：宁明群英师司令部；一面写着：中共南宁地委直属机关、学校钢铁野战军总部。棚中间放着两组办公室桌，三个电话机、矿石样品、各团试炼出来的铁的样品和茶壶等等把桌子摆得满满的。棚的两边是床铺，有的铺木板，有的铺茅草，有的就干脆铺在地上。
    在司令部周围的几个山坡上，到处是草棚。深夜，我们从草棚走过去，看见绝大部分床铺都空着。在一个山隘上，有一个大窑，直径两丈多，深将近三丈。窑两边有两棵已砍去树枝的大树，树上挂两盏电灯。在窑底，人们正在修通风道和窑门。窑四周的矿石和木柴快堆得蔓到山顶了，但是，数以千计的挑矿石、扛木柴的人流，仍不断地从两边山坡的小道上涌上来。红旗人民公社——群英师第九团党委书记屈益成同志告诉我们，这个大窑是睦南人民公社、海渊人民公社、大新县钢铁兵团、南宁地委直属大中学校和他们协作搞的。大新钢铁兵团二千多人负责运矿石。这个兵团在23日晚上才赶到工地，连住宿的草棚还顾不上搭，第二天早上就投入战斗。
    在另一个山坡上，有八个窑已经点了火。每一个窑门有一个人专门负责添柴看火，窑的旁边还有将近一百人。他们有的在碎矿石，有的在把长木头截成短木头，不断地往窑顶上加。这是公母山人民公社第八连负责的炼铁窑。连长是个二十五岁的女青年，叫邹海金。她很熟练地指挥别人烧火，好像炼铁老手；但是，她告诉我们，以前，不仅没见过炼铁炉，连铁矿石是个什么样子也不知道。
          女儿也赛后生郎
    妇女多，是亭亮钢铁基地的特色之一。一般连队里，妇女占三分之一左右，有的占二分之一以上。广西妇女本来就以下地劳动著称，这一次在钢铁战线上，她们和男人一样，要挑矿石就挑矿石，要扛木头就扛木头，要砍树就砍树，要挖矿就挖矿，要烧窑就烧窑，要熬夜就熬夜，要淋雨就淋雨，比男人毫无逊色。公母山人民公社有个女青年，叫曾荣珍，她向营长和所有的男人挑战，比挑重、比坚持时间长、比走得快。挑矿石，十二里距离，她一天能挑七担，每担最少八九十斤，有时一百多斤。开矿石抡大锤，男人一夜间得换几个人，她却能坚持到天亮。板棍人民公社——群英师第六团第六连，有一个妇女卫星炉（窑），由十个妇女负责。有一个战士叫李冠英，党员，四十八岁了，人们都叫她“老妈妈”。有一次，书记试验炉第一炉升了火，就遭着大雨，人们见她老了叫她回去避雨，她坚持留下来和男人一起拉风箱。衣服湿了，叫她回去换，她不肯，她说：“我不见铁水流出来不回去！在这里烘一烘，衣服就干了。”
    有一首男女对唱的山歌，是描写一对男女在钢铁基地上比干劲的。这首山歌是这样：
    女唱：要吃龙肉先下海，
        要擒猛虎上山岗；
        月底完成铁任务，
        光荣任务大家当。
    男唱：星星顶光不比月，
        吃饭送茶那比汤；
        十八后生（注：后生指青年）豪气阔，
        千斤重担敢担当。
    女唱：别说男儿豪气壮，
        女儿也赛后生郎；
        铁山也要低头过，
        矿石要它变成钢。
    各团各连的领导同志说起自己的战士，总流露着喜悦和骄傲。他们说，我们这里都是上游人，至少是中游人。
    确是值得骄傲，因为这些人都是从公社里挑选出来的。大新钢铁兵团团长黎福田同志说，以钢为纲的口号，把一切人的干劲都带动起来了。一个多月以来，大新钢铁兵团转战左江一带，先在扶绥县挖煤，后来转到崇左县搞土高炉，再到龙津县烧木炭，最后才转亭亮搞大窑。一转移就是几百里，全是步行，群众毫无意见，而且像军队一样迅速，接到命令后两个小时就全部出发。黎福田同志最后说：“有这样的人民，摇山山崩，踏地地平，还有什么困难能够挡住我们前进呢？”（附图片）
