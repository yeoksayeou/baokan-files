Better Rest, Better Labor
Chao Ying Commune Combines Work and Rest for High Production Efficiency
(According to a report in the Dazhong Daily) The Chao Ying People's Commune in Chengwu County has been paying attention to the combination of work and rest during intense labor, enabling the vast number of commune members to be full of energy and improve labor efficiency due to adequate rest time, completing various production tasks quickly and well.

After the commune was established in mid-September, it implemented military organization and combat-like action, and by early October, it had achieved collectivization of life. The Commune Party Committee paid close attention to the material life of the vast number of commune members from the beginning, ensuring that all public canteens were generally well-run, which satisfied all men, women, old and young in the commune. However, due to the urgency of production tasks and the shortage of labor, coupled with the incomplete renovation of production tools, some battalions and companies did not pay enough attention to the rest of the commune members. The commune members worked hard day and night, with very little sleep time each day, which began to affect the health and production efficiency of the commune members. The Party Committee promptly studied and proposed that, under normal circumstances, ensure that commune members have one-third of their time for rest each day and two days off each month; at the same time, vigorously promote cultural and recreational activities in each battalion and company. However, cadres and commune members had different views on this issue. One view was active support, believing that the selfless labor spirit of the vast number of commune members who do not consider labor time, do not talk about work points, and work hard day and night is very valuable, and in order to protect this enthusiasm of the commune members, they must be given adequate rest time. Another view was support, but disagreement with proposing adequate rest now, believing that rest should be taken in the winter for a big rest. A third view was that resting for a few hours during the Great Leap Forward would delay a lot of work and should not be allowed. Another view was that since the grain supply system has been implemented, food is free and there is no need to worry about food and clothing, so there is no need to rest anymore.

In response to these ideological situations, the Party Committee organized a forum and debate among cadres and commune members, mainly debating whether properly organizing commune members' rest is beneficial or not beneficial to production, and whether appropriate rest is better or a big rest is better. Through concrete facts, the ideological understanding was unified by discussing real issues. During the forum and debate, the situation when deep plowing the early stubble land to plant wheat was recalled: The "May 1st" battalion and the "July 1st" battalion of the commune were connected together, and the labor, land, and tools of the two battalions were similar. The "May 1st" battalion started working all night from the beginning. After four or five days, some commune members could not physically support it, and the number of laborers attending work decreased from more than 1,200 to more than 800, and work efficiency slowly decreased, resulting in losing the competition with outside battalions. When the "July 1st" battalion was deep plowing, it did not exceed 12 o'clock every night, and there was also a midnight snack; the commune members were allowed to rest for one and a half to two hours at noon every day; therefore, the commune members were always full of energy and won the competition with outside battalions. Later, with the help of the county Party committee work group, the "May 1st" battalion implemented the "July 1st" battalion's method of combining labor and rest, and achieved victory in the second competition evaluation. This clear example made everyone further realize that hard work must be combined with proper rest, and only with both work and leisure can the exuberant production enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members be maintained and labor efficiency be improved.

Then, measures were studied and regulations were stipulated. In addition to strengthening the leadership of the commune's welfare department and the battalion and company welfare committees and groups, the commune's second secretary and the instructors and political instructors of each battalion and company were specifically assigned to manage the commune members' life issues. Now, under normal circumstances, commune members get up at 5:00 in the morning, practice martial arts for more than an hour, and then go to work collectively after breakfast, resting for one and a half to two hours at noon. After eating dinner at 6:00 in the afternoon, they participate in cultural and political studies, or go to clubs and amateur drama troupes to read books and newspapers and participate in recreational activities. If there are urgent tasks, they generally do not exceed 12 o'clock. Every half month, there is also a holiday for one day, where all canteens improve their meals, amateur drama troupes perform plays, and the commune shows movies. Because the commune's leaders care about the commune members' lives and combine labor and rest well, the commune members are all full of energy and soaring enthusiasm, and work efficiency has been significantly improved. Deep plowing has increased from an average of three-tenths of an acre per person per day to more than five-tenths of an acre, and the depth has also exceeded the previous level. The labor force attendance of the entire commune has increased from more than 8,800 to a level that can often maintain more than 14,000.

    休息好劳动更好
    超英公社劳逸结合生产效率高
    据大众日报消息　城武县超英人民公社，在紧张的劳动中注意了劳逸结合，使广大社员由于有适当的休息时间，个个精神饱满，劳动效率提高，各项生产任务完成的既快且好。
    该社于9月中旬建成后，实行了组织军事化、行动战斗化，到10月上旬又实现了生活集体化。公社党委会对广大社员的物质生活开始就比较关心，使个个公共食堂一般都办得很好，全社男女老幼都很满意。但是，由于生产任务紧迫，又加劳力不足，生产工具没有全部革新，有的营、连对社员的休息注意得不够，社员日夜苦干，每天睡觉的时间很少，开始影响到社员身体和生产效率。党委及时研究提出，在一般情况下，保证作到社员每天要有三分之一的休息时间，每月放假两天；同时，要大力搞好每个营、连的文化娱乐活动。可是，在干部和社员中对这一问题却存有不同的看法，一种是积极拥护，认为广大社员不计劳动时间，不讲工分，日夜苦战的忘我劳动精神是非常宝贵的，为了保护社员这种积极性，一定要让社员有适当的休息时间。另一种是虽然拥护，但不同意现在提适当休息，他们认为要休息到冬季来个大休息。第三种意见认为，在大跃进中休息几个小时就要耽误很多工夫，不能休息。还有一种意见认为，实行了粮食供给制，吃饭不要钱，吃穿都不用愁，不应再来休息了。
    党委针对这些思想情况，在干部和社员中组织了鸣放辩论，主要是辩论了适当的组织社员休息对生产有利还是没有利？是适当的休息好还是大休息好？通过具体事实，就实论虚，统一了思想认识。在鸣放辩论中，还回忆了开始深翻早茬地种麦时的情形：该社“五一”营和“七一”营相连在一块，两个营的劳力、土地、工具都差不多。“五一”营一开始就干通宵，干了四、五天之后，有些社员身体支持不住，出勤的劳力由一千二百多人减少到八百多人，工效慢慢的降低，结果与外营竞赛输了。“七一”营在深翻地时，每天晚上不超过十二点钟，还有夜饭；每天中午让社员休息一个半到两个小时；因此，社员的精神始终都很充沛，与外营竞赛赢了。后来“五一”营在县委工作组的帮助下，实行了“七一”营有劳动有休息的办法，到第二次竞赛评议时，取得了胜利。这一鲜明的实例，使大家进一步认识到，苦战必须与适当的休整相结合，有劳有逸才能保住广大社员的旺盛生产情绪，提高劳动工效。
    接着研究了措施，规定了制度，除加强公社福利部和营、连福利委员会、小组的领导外，公社由第二书记，各营、连由教导员和指导员分工专门管理社员的生活问题。现在，该社在一般的情况下，社员每天早晨五时起床，进行一个多小时的练武后，吃过早饭集体上工，中午休息一个半到两个小时。下午六时吃过晚饭后，便分别参加文化、政治学习，或到俱乐部、业余剧团，阅读书报和参加文娱活动。有突击任务，一般也不超过十二点。每半月还过假日一天，各个食堂都改善生活，业余剧团演戏，公社放电影。由于社的领导上关心社员生活，把劳动与休整结合得好，社员个个精力充沛，干劲冲天，工效有了显著提高。深翻地由每人每天平均三分提高到五分多，深度也超过以前。全社劳力出勤，由八千八百余名上升到经常能保持一万四千余名。
