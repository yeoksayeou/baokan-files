    High-Standard Gardening is the Foundation of High Yields
    Jiao Jiaju, County Head of An'guo County
    The high-standard gardening being promoted in An'guo County this year is currently the most advanced cultivation method in agricultural production. This cultivation method, firstly, absorbs the experience of old farmers who have been gardening for many years; secondly, it absorbs the advanced experience of high yield increases that have emerged in the great leap forward movement of agricultural production; and thirdly, it also absorbs the achievements of modern agricultural scientific research. Because high-standard gardening has such advanced nature, it also, to a large extent, gets rid of the threat of various natural disasters and puts agricultural production on a relatively solid foundation. Land cultivated using this method is all leveled and has sufficient water for irrigation. Whenever water is needed, it is available, and droughts are permanently eliminated. It also has a complete drainage system to prevent waterlogging. It has sufficient pesticides and agricultural machinery to prevent and control various insect pests... Therefore, the development of cultivation methods from low-standard gardening to high-standard gardening is the foundation for achieving large-area, high-yield production.
    The contents of high-standard gardening are:
    I. The characteristic of gardening is irrigated land, so high-standard gardening has achieved water conservancy. But this kind of irrigated land is different from the irrigated land of old farmers. Old farmers used waterwheels to irrigate, and the land had little water storage capacity; high-standard gardening uses machine wells and machine irrigation with sufficient water supply. On such irrigated land, the land is first leveled, so that the ground is as flat as a mirror and the soil is as fine as flour. Then it is formed into small plots, generally about five li in size. After leveling and plot formation, the land reaches "four straight" (ditches, ridge backs, field edges, and furrows are all straight), "four level" (roads, ditches, ground, and ridge backs), and "three uniform" (seeding amount, fertilization amount, and irrigation amount). In these lands, large areas are connected into squares, field roads are built, the land looks like lines when viewed straight, rows when viewed horizontally, and fish scales when viewed diagonally. This cultivation method is much more detailed than that of the old farmers. Generally, it takes more than twenty workdays just to cultivate the land to sowing.
    II. The land is deeply plowed. Generally, it is deeply plowed three or four feet, the deepest reaches seven or eight feet, and the shallowest is also more than one and a half feet.
    III. Large amounts of fertilizer are applied. Generally, more than 100,000 jin of fertilizer is applied, and in high cases, more than 200,000 jin, so that the soil is layered with fertilizer. A large amount of soil fertilizer, sesame cake fertilizer, etc., are also applied.
    IV. High-density planting. Generally, more than 60 jin of seeds are sown per mu, and the highest is 200-300 jin.
    The order of implementing high-standard gardening is generally as follows: First, level the land and remove obstacles (roads, ditches, pits, etc.); once the land is leveled, deep plowing begins. In order to facilitate the removal of topsoil, the land is plowed with a tractor before plowing deeply; after deep plowing, fertilizer is applied to ensure that the soil is layered with fertilizer; after fertilization, water is irrigated; after irrigation, chemical fertilizer is applied, and the land is finely tilled again; after tilling, the land is leveled again; on the leveled land, the ridges and backs are formed; after they are formed, sowing begins. Before sowing, some apply chemical fertilizer once and select good seeds. The seeds are wind-selected and water-selected, and are mixed with medicine to prevent underground insect pests. After sowing, the land is leveled again. On black sticky soil, wheat ridges must also be dug to facilitate the emergence of wheat seedlings. After the wheat seedlings emerge, any missing seedlings or broken ridges should be replenished in time. Then, according to seasonal changes, strengthen winter and spring field management until the wheat harvest.
    Due to the adoption of this advanced cultivation method, the quality of this year's wheat sowing is better than any year before. The emerged wheat seedlings are all black and shiny, truly taller and darker than in previous years.
    High-standard gardening is the direction of improving cultivation methods. We must also promote high-standard gardening on other crops and strive to become a high-yield county with 1,000 jin of cotton and 10,000 jin of grain per mu next year.

    高标准园田化是高额丰产的基础
    安国县县长　焦家驹
    安国县今年推广的高标准园田化是目前农业生产上最先进的耕作方法，这种耕作方法，第一、吸取了多年来老农种园田的经验；第二、吸取了农业生产大跃进运动中出现的高额增产的先进经验；第三、还吸取了现代农业科学研究方面的成果。由于高标准的园田化具有这样的先进性，也就在很大程度内摆脱了各种自然灾害的威胁，把农业生产放在比较稳固的基础上。采用这种方法耕作的土地，都是经过平整的，有足够的水量灌溉，何时用水何时就有，旱灾永远绝迹；它又有完备的排水系统，可以防止沥涝灾害；它有足够的农药农械，可以预防和除治各种虫害……。所以说耕作方法上这种由低标准园田化到高标准园田化的发展，是实现大面积高额丰产的基础。
    高标准园田化的内容是：
    一、园田的特点是水浇地，所以高标准园田都实现了水利化。但这种水浇地与老农的水浇地不同。老农用辘辘、水车浇地，土地蓄水量少；而高标准园田是用水量充足的机井和机器灌溉的。这样的水浇地上，先把土地都平整好，做到地平如镜，土细如面。然后整成小畦，一般的有五厘大。经过平地、整畦，土地达到“四直”（水沟、畦背、地边、垅都是直的）、“四平”（道、水沟、地面、畦背）、“三匀”（播种量、施肥量、浇水量）。在这些土地里，实现了大片连成方，田间公路化，土地直看如线，横看成排，斜看成鱼鳞形。这样的耕作法比老农细致的多，一般光耕地到播种就用工二十多个。
    二、土地经过深翻。一般深翻三、四尺，最深的达到了七、八尺，最浅的也在一尺五以上。
    三、大量施肥。一般施肥都在十万斤以上，高的达二十多万斤，作到层土层肥，还施了大量土化肥、麻饼肥等。
    四、高度密植。一般每亩下种六十斤以上，最多的达二、三百斤。
    推行高标准园田化的顺序，一般是这样的：首先把土地平整好，把障碍物（道沟、坑等）都清除掉；一平好地，就开始深翻地。为了便于取出表土，翻地前先用拖拉机耕一遍；深翻后就施肥，做到层土层肥；施肥后就灌水；灌过水施化肥，并把土地细串一遍；串后再把土地平整一遍；在平好的土地上整畦背、整畦；整好后就播种。在播种前，有的耩一次化肥，并选好种籽。种籽经过风选和水选，并用药拌种，以防治地下虫害。播种后把土地再平整一遍，在黑粘土地上，还要扒一下麦垅，使麦苗便于出土。麦苗出土后，如有缺苗断垅现象要及时补足。然后根据季节变化情况，加强冬春田间管理，一直到麦收。
    由于采用了这种先进的耕作方法，今年小麦播种质量比任何一年都好，已出土的麦苗，都是黑油油的，真是比往年高一头、黑一色。
    高标准园田化是改进耕作方法的方向。我们在其他农作物上也要推行高标准园田化，力争明年成为亩产千斤棉、万斤粮的丰产县。
