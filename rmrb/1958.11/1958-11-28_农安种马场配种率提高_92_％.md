    Nong'an Stud Farm Increases Mating Rate by 92%
    (Our dispatch) Jilin Province's Nong'an Stud Farm has set a new national record for horse mating this year. The farm's sixty-seven adult Soviet Ardennes stallions each mated with an average of 405 mares, a 92% increase over last year. One stallion, "Nongyou," mated with 1,200 mares, more than double the national record it set last year.
    The reason Nong'an Stud Farm achieved such remarkable results this year is that, in addition to closely relying on the leadership of Party and government at all levels, giving prominence to politics, and overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, they made many reforms in mating techniques and work methods. They broke the conventional standards for semen, reducing the standard for a single insemination from 1 billion sperm to 300 million, doubling the mating effect. During the livestock mating season, they vigorously increased the number of insemination stations, inseminating day and night, and not resting in windy or rainy weather, solving the contradiction between busy farming and mating. They trained a large number of farmer technicians, passing on the technology to the masses and realizing the blooming of artificial insemination everywhere.

    农安种马场配种率提高92％
    本报讯　吉林省农安种马场，创造了今年马匹配种的全国最高纪录。全场六十七匹成龄苏联阿尔登种公马，平均每匹种公马配种四百零五匹，比去年提高92％。其中有一匹“农友”号种公马配种一千二百匹，比这匹马去年创造的全国最高纪录又高出一倍多。
    农安种马场今年所以取得了这样卓越的成绩，除紧密依靠各级党政领导，政治挂帅，克服右倾保守思想，在配种技术和工作方法上做了很多改革。他们打破了输精标准的常规，一次输精标准由十亿精子减少到三亿，使配种效果提高一倍。在牲畜配种季节里，他们大力增设输精站，白天黑夜都配种，刮风下雨也不闲，解决了农忙与配种的矛盾。培训了大批农民技术手，把技术交给群众，实现人工授精遍地开花。
