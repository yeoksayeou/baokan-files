Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 9th: The Yunnan Province convened its First Session of the Second People's Congress from the 2nd to the 6th. The meeting called on people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province to continue to fight hard on the basis of great victories, and to strive for a greater leap forward and fundamentally change the face of Yunnan Province.

Liu Minghui, Deputy Governor of Yunnan Province, delivered a work report on behalf of the Provincial People's Committee at the meeting. The report stated that under the leadership of the Party and relying on the strong unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the province, Yunnan Province has achieved significant victories in all aspects, resulting in a significant change in the province's landscape. On the industrial front, more than 43,000 industrial and mining enterprises have been established, creating a magnificent scene of "machines humming everywhere, factories all over the cities and countryside." On the agricultural front, an unprecedented harvest has been confirmed, with the total grain output of the province expected to double, and the production of cash crops such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and sugarcane increasing by one to three times compared to last year.

According to the central government's instructions and the specific situation of Yunnan Province, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed a plan to "work hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of our province." The main requirements of the plan are: under the unified plan of the central government and the support of the cooperative regions, and on the premise of ensuring the state's key construction, to initially establish a relatively complete and relatively independent industrial system and a relatively developed transportation system in Yunnan Province; secondly, to initially achieve agricultural mechanization, achieve a large surplus of grain, cotton self-sufficiency, and a large export of other cash crops and animal products; while developing the economy, continue to carry out technological revolution and cultural revolution. The plan emphasizes that the people of the province should not only rely on their own efforts to develop Yunnan's national economy and accelerate and advance the tasks of the province's second five-year plan, but also contribute more to the country's socialist and communist cause. 1959 is the decisive year of the three-year hard battle, requiring that next year continue to maintain and exceed this year's leap-forward speed, and achieve decisive victories in the construction and production of backbone industries such as steel and machinery, as well as in agriculture.

At the meeting, more than 140 representatives of various ethnic groups, including Dao Jingban, engaged in enthusiastic discussions. They talked about the tremendous changes brought about by the situation of the Great Leap Forward, and the representatives were full of infinite confidence in the road to greater prosperity for all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Party.

At the end of the conference, Yu Yichuan was elected as the Governor of Yunnan Province, Liu Minghui, Zhang Chong, Wu Zuomin, Liu Zhuofu, Guo Chao, Liu Piyun, etc. were elected as Deputy Governors, Dao Jingban and 36 others were elected as members of the Yunnan Provincial People's Committee, and Li Woru was elected as the President of the Yunnan Provincial Higher People's Court. The conference also elected 45 representatives to the National People's Congress: Dao Jingban (Dai), Yu Yichuan, Wang Shaoyan, Fu Yizhi (Lisu), Zhao Cunxin (Dai), Liu Chun, Liu Shuqing (female), Liu Rongxian (Yi), Liu Aruzi (Yi), Song Renqiong, Li Neng, Li Guanghua (Lahu), Li Zirong (Bai), Li Hecai (Hani), Li Guiying (Yi, female), Li Kairong (Yao), Han Fuyou (Dai), Geng Jue (Tibetan), Zhou Xing, Zhou Baozhong (Bai), Zhu Liangfu, He Fengzhao (Naxi), Ma Jian (Hui), Ma Jikong, Hu Zhonghua (Kawa), Xu Jiarui, Qin Renchang, Gao Shiqi, Zhang Chong (Yi), Zhang Zizhai (Bai), Zhang Tianfang, Zhang Huiying (female), Zhang Linzhi, Zeng Wenchang, Pu Guizhong (Yi), Dong Fusheng, Chu Tunan, Lei Chunguo (Jingpo), Zhao Jiuzhang, Zhao Zhongqi (Hui), Xiong Kaiyou (Miao), Lu Han (Yi), Wei Yanjing (Kawa), Luo Yuntong (Zhuang), Gong Shou (Dai).

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 11th: The First Session of the Second People's Congress of Anhui Province was held in Hefei from November 3rd to 6th.

The meeting reviewed the tremendous achievements made by the province in industry, agriculture, and cultural and educational undertakings over the past year. This year, Anhui Province has witnessed an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in industry. By the end of September, the province's total industrial output value had already exceeded the annual plan. It is estimated that the total industrial output value for the entire year will increase by 1.7 times compared to 1957. In particular, a mass movement of the whole party and all the people to run the iron and steel industry has emerged throughout the province. After several months of hard work, tremendous achievements have been made. It is expected that 170,000 tons of steel and 1.03 million tons of iron will be produced by the end of the year. Significant achievements have also been made in trial-producing new products, improving product quality, and reducing costs. In less than ten months, more than 2,000 new products have been created and successfully trial-produced throughout the province. The achievements made in Anhui Province's agricultural Great Leap Forward this year are even more remarkable. It is estimated that the province's total grain output this year can reach 55 billion to 60 billion catties, an increase of 1.2 to 1.4 times compared to last year, realizing the grain yield per mu target set by the National Agricultural Development Program for Anhui Province nine years ahead of schedule. The total cotton output reached 3 million dan, an increase of two times compared to last year. The output of oil crops, tea, large livestock, pigs, and aquatic products has also increased significantly. Since last winter, the total amount of earth and stone work completed in the province for water conservancy projects and drought resistance has reached more than 6 billion cubic meters, more than three times the total amount of earth and stone work for water conservancy projects in the previous eight years. At present, some areas have crisscrossing rivers and canals, and interconnected ditches and ponds, initially realizing the goals of river network and paddy field. After nearly two months of effort, the province has basically realized the people's commune system. Currently, the number of households in the province joining people's communes accounts for 99.4% of the total number of rural households. Great achievements have also been made in cultural education, science, sports, and health undertakings.

In accordance with the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and after full discussion by all the representatives, the conference outlined a blueprint for the people of the province to further develop Anhui's socialist construction cause. The meeting held that this year is the first year of "three years of hard work to change the face," and a good foundation has been laid this year. The people of the province should, on this basis, further implement the general line of socialist construction, strengthen unity, cooperate closely, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, work hard, ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's tasks, and actively make various preparations to strive for a comprehensive and greater leap forward in steel, grain, machinery, and other production and construction next year.

The conference elected Huang Yan as the Governor, Sun Zhongde, Zhang Kaifan, Wang Guangyu, Su Yiran, Lu Xuebin, Yu Yanong, Ma Changyan, Chen Yinnan, Gui Peng, Wang Zhong, Yao Ke and other eleven people as Deputy Governors, Wang Zulie and 43 others as members of the Provincial People's Committee.

    云南省副省长刘明辉代表省人民委员会在会上作了工作报告。报告中说：云南省在党的领导下，依靠全省各族人民坚强团结一致的努力，各方面都获得了重大的胜利，使全省面貌起了显著的变化。在工业战线上，办起了四万三千多个工矿企业，出现了“机器到处响，工厂遍城乡”的壮丽景象。在农业战线上，空前丰收的局面已经肯定，预计全省粮食总产量将翻一番，棉花、烤烟、甘蔗等经济作物都比去年增产一倍到三倍。
    根据中央的指示和云南省的具体情况，中共云南省委提出了“苦战三年，根本改变我省面貌”的规划。规划的主要要求是：在中央统一计划和协作区的支援下，在保证国家重点建设的前提下，初步建立起云南省比较完整和相对独立的工业体系和比较发达的交通体系；其次，初步做到农业机械化，做到粮食大有富裕，棉花自给，其他经济作物和畜产品有大量出口；在经济发展的同时，继续进行技术革命和文化革命。规划强调全省人民不但要自力更生地发展云南省国民经济，加速和提前实现全省第二个五年计划的任务，而且要为国家的社会主义和共产主义事业贡献更多的力量。1959年是苦战三年决定性的一年，要求明年继续保持并超过今年的跃进速度，在钢铁机械等骨干性工业的建设和生产方面以及农业方面取得决定性的胜利。
    会上，刀京版等一百四十多位各民族代表展开了热烈讨论，他们谈到大跃进的形势所带来的种种巨大变化，对于各族人民在党的领导下走向更加繁荣的道路，代表们充满了无限的信心。

    会议根据党的社会主义建设总路线的精神，经过全体代表充分的讨论，为全省人民规划出了进一步发展安徽省社会主义建设事业的蓝图。会议认为，今年是“苦战三年，改变面貌”的第一年，在这一年已奠定了良好的基础。全省人民应在这个基础上，进一步贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，加强团结，密切协作，戒骄戒躁，艰苦奋斗，保证完成和超额完成今年的各项工作任务，并积极做好各项准备，为力争明年的钢铁、粮食、机械和其他各项生产建设的全面的更大跃进而努力。
