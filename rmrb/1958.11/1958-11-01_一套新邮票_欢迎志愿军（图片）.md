A New Set of Stamps to Welcome the Volunteers
Jiang Cheng's Poem

    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will soon issue a set of commemorative stamps to commemorate the triumphant return of the Chinese People's Volunteers, with a total of three designs.

    (1) Korean and Chinese brothers go to the front,
    	Fighting on the snowy, icy battlefield,
    	Vigorously attack the American paper tiger,
    	The hero's fame is known throughout the world.

    (2) Sharing joys and sorrows for a full eight years,
    	The hearts of the Korean and Chinese people are linked,
    	Amani bids farewell to her good children,
    	Endless reluctance to part.

    (3) When they left, they were only two or three years old,
    	Returning with red scarves,
    	A bouquet of flowers to welcome the uncles,
    	To defend world peace forever.

    一套新邮票　欢迎志愿军
    江城配诗
    邮电部为了纪念中国人民志愿军凯旋归国，即将发行中国人民志愿军凯旋归国纪念邮票一套，共三图。（一）朝中兄弟上前方，
    雪地冰天作战场，
    痛击美国纸老虎，
    英雄威名天下扬。（二）同甘共苦八年整，
    朝中人民心连心，
    阿妈妮送好儿女，
    不尽依依惜别情。（三）走时才只两三岁，
    归时带上红领巾，
    一把鲜花迎叔叔，
    保卫世界永和平。
