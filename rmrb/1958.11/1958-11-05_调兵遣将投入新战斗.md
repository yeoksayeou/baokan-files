    Deploying Troops and Generals into a New Battle

    The Yulin Special District of Guangxi, after a great victory on the steel front, in addition to leaving a portion of people to persist in the steel battle, immediately transferred the bulk of the steel army to the agricultural front to launch an intense autumn harvest battle. This approach is entirely correct.

    At present, the completion of the national steel task is within sight of victory. As pointed out in the editorial of this newspaper on the 3rd, the urgent task on the steel front is mainly to improve the quality of steel. It should move from the stage of primarily focusing on quantity to a stage of primarily focusing on improving quality while continuing to increase quantity. Therefore, it is currently urgently needed to consolidate and improve the results of the small-scale indigenous furnaces, and carry out the "Five Determinations" work of "fixed furnaces" (superior furnace types), "fixed points" (bases), "fixed groups" (furnace groups), "fixed personnel" (staff), and "fixed leadership," so that small-scale indigenous furnaces gradually develop in the direction of small-scale modern furnaces, and gradually establish some small and medium-sized, indigenous-modern integrated steel joint bases, reduce the number of the steel army, and improve the quality of the steel army.

    The result of doing so is that it can both consolidate and improve the mass steel production movement, and immediately draw out a large number of laborers to strengthen the agricultural front, do a good job in rush harvesting and rush planting, so that the fruits of our year's hard agricultural production are harvested without any loss, and that our greater harvest next year is given the first very reliable guarantee. This is precisely the correct approach to implement the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. Therefore, the experience of Yulin Special District in Guangxi is well worth learning from in various places.

    调兵遣将投入新战斗
    广西玉林专区在钢铁战线大捷以后，除了留下一部分人坚持钢铁战斗以外，把大部钢铁大军立即调到农业战线，展开紧张的秋收战斗。这个做法是十分正确的。
    目前，完成全国的钢铁任务已经胜利在望，正如本报3日社论所指出的，当前钢铁战线上的迫切任务，主要是提高钢铁的质量，应当由突击数量为主的阶段，进到在继续增加数量的基础上以提高质量为主的阶段。因而目前急需巩固和提高小土群的战果，进行定炉（优良炉型）、定点（基地）、定组（炉群）、定员（人员）、定领导的五定工作，使小土群逐渐向小洋群的方向发展，逐步建立起一些中小型的土洋结合的钢铁联合基地，减少钢铁大军的人数，提高钢铁大军的质量。
    这样做的结果，既可以巩固和提高群众性的钢铁生产运动，又可以即时抽调出大批劳动力加强农业战线，作好抢收抢种工作，使我们辛劳一年的农业生产果实一点不丢地收回来，使我们明年的更大丰收得到第一个十分可靠的保证。这正是贯彻工农业同时并举的正确作法。因此，广西玉林专区的经验，是十分值得各地学习的。
