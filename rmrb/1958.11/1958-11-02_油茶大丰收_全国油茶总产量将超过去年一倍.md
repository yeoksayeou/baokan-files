Bumper Oil-Tea Harvest
National Total Output of Oil-Tea Will More Than Double Last Year

(Our dispatch) This year's oil-tea production is a bumper harvest. Jiangxi Province's more than ten million mu of oil-tea will produce 120 million jin of oil, averaging seven to eight jin of tea oil per person according to the province's population. Hunan Province has recently been rushing to pick oil-tea, having completed harvesting on 5.6 million mu, accounting for 65% of the province's total oil-tea area, collecting a total of 18.27 million dan of fruit, averaging 25 jin of oil per mu, an increase of 150% over last year. Zhejiang Province will produce 1 million dan of tea oil, also an increase of 150% over last year. Guizhou Province expects to produce 840,000 dan of tea oil this year. It is estimated that the national tea oil production will exceed 5 million dan, more than double last year's production.

This year's oil-tea production has seen many high-yield and abundant forests. According to statistics from only 19 townships and communes in 7 counties in Hunan, Hubei, and Zhejiang provinces, 2,325 mu have produced more than 2,000 jin of oil per mu, and more than 5,370 mu have produced more than 1,000 jin. The old revolutionary base area of ​​the Red People's Commune in Pingjiang County, Hunan, known as the "Sea of Oil," has quadrupled its oil-tea production this year compared to last year. Among them, a 1.6 mu experimental mountain averaged 8,173 jin of oil per mu, setting a high-yield satellite record for oil-tea.

The widespread bumper harvest of oil-tea this year is due to the upsurge in high-yield oil-tea production in the major oil-tea producing areas during the large-scale greening campaign. For example, Changshan County in Zhejiang Province vigorously promoted high-yield oil-tea, launching the "Double Guarantee and Double Over-fulfillment" campaign (guarantee flowers, guarantee fruit, over-fulfill production, over-fulfill planning). The county party committee established a command headquarters, with the first secretary taking personal charge. Once the order was given, tens of thousands of laborers were immediately mobilized to launch a general offensive on the tea mountains, clearing mountains and nurturing more than 100,000 mu of oil-tea, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest of oil-tea. According to statistics, there are still 7 million mu of oil-tea mountains in the country that urgently need to be reclaimed and restored this winter and next spring. If we further strengthen tending and management, next year we can double the production of the existing oil-tea forests in the country.

    油茶大丰收
    全国油茶总产量将超过去年一倍
    本报讯　今年油茶大丰收。江西省一千多万亩油茶，将产油一亿二千万斤，按全省人口平均每人有茶油七、八斤。湖南省最近抢摘油茶，已采完五百六十万亩，占全省油茶总面积的65％，共采果一千八百二十七万担，平均每亩产油二十五斤，比去年增产一倍半。浙江省将产茶油一百万担，也比去年增产一倍半。贵州省预计今年可产茶油八十四万担。估计全国茶油产量将突破五百万担，比去年增产一倍。
    今年油茶生产出现了许多高额丰产林。仅湖南、湖北、浙江三省七个县十九个乡、社的统计，亩产二千斤油以上的达二千三百二十五亩，一千斤以上的达五千三百七十多亩。素以油海著称的革命老根据地湖南平江县红色人民公社，今年油茶产量比去年翻了四番。其中有一亩六分试验山，平均亩产油八千一百七十三斤，创油茶高产卫星。
    今年油茶普遍丰收，是由于在大规模绿化高潮中，各主要油茶产区掀起了油茶丰产的热潮。如浙江省常山县大搞油茶丰产，掀起“双保双超”运动（保花、保果，超产、超规划），县委成立了指挥部，第一书记亲自挂帅。号令一下，立即出动了数以万计的劳动大军向茶山展开了总攻势，铲山抚育油茶十万多亩，获得油茶空前丰收。据统计全国现仍有七百万油茶山亟待今冬明春垦复，如再加强抚育管理，明年可使全国现有油茶成林增产一倍。
