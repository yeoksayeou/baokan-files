Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Kyodo News Agency broadcast on the 18th a report from its special correspondent Okuto in Taipei, discussing how the Chiang Kai-shek group is brewing a response to the United States' intention to abandon Chiang Kai-shek and its malicious plot to isolate Taiwan and implement a "trusteeship" over Taiwan.

Okuto wrote, "After the Chiang-Dulles meeting announced that they would no longer 'counterattack the mainland,' a rather subtle dynamic has emerged within the (Taiwan) Nationalist Government (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group). It is said that the Nationalist Government, no longer bearing the full responsibility for counterattacking the mainland, has only three paths to take: 1. Trusteeship by the United Nations; 2. Taiwan independence; 3. Peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party."

He said, "Under these circumstances, the Nationalist Government certainly hopes to maintain the current position and may oppose any of these three paths. However, after the Democratic Party's victory in the US midterm elections, the possibility of the United States moving towards the first and second paths is increasing. In this situation, the last bargaining chip the Nationalist Government can use to negotiate with the United States is to indicate that it will take the third path (peace talks), which the United States fears most, to restrain the United States' actions."

The Japanese reporter also said, "It is said that in fact, some influential people within the Nationalist Government believe that rather than losing their long-held position due to being placed under UN trusteeship or declaring Taiwan independence, it would be better to launch Kuomintang-Communist peace talks to retaliate against this betrayal by the United States."

Okuto finally pointed out, "If the United States pushes its (isolating Taiwan) policy too hastily, then perhaps a completely unexpected situation of Kuomintang-Communist peace talks may occur."

    担心美国孤立台湾和实行“托管”
    蒋介石集团中有人在筹谋出路
    日本共同社驻台北记者报道台湾动态
    新华社19日讯　共同社18日广播了它的特派记者奥户从台北发出的一篇报道，谈到蒋介石集团内部正在酝酿着如何对付美国要抛弃蒋介石，妄图实现其孤立台湾和“托管”台湾的恶毒阴谋。
    奥户写道，“杜蒋经过会谈宣布不再反攻大陆以后，在（台湾）国府（指蒋介石集团）内部产生了相当微妙的动态。据说，不再承担反攻大陆的全部责任的国府，只有如下三条路可走：一、由联合国托管；二、台湾独立；三、国共讲和。”
    他说，“在这种情况下，国府当然希望继续保持目前的立场，可能对这三条道路中的任何一条都表示反对。但是，在民主党在美国的中期选举中获胜以后，美国今后向着第一条和第二条路前进的可能性越来越大。在这种情况下，国府可以同美国讨价还价的最后一着棋是：表示要走美国最担心的第三条（讲和）道路，来牵制美国的行动。”
    这位日本记者又说，“据说事实上，国府内部有一部分有势力的人认为，与其由于被联合国托管或者宣布台湾独立而丧失一向保持的地位，倒不如针对美国的这种背信行为，举行国共和谈，来实行报复还要好。”
    奥户最后指出，“如果美国推行它的（孤立台湾）政策过急，那么，说不定也许会发生完全出乎意料的国共讲和的情况。”
