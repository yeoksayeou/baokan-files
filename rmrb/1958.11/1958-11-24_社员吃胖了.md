Public Canteens Praised by All

    Commune Members Gain Weight
    The public canteen of the Third Company of the Wu Ming Camp in the Longhua People's Commune, Xianyou County, Fujian Province, feeds 723 people. Thanks to the efforts of the cooks, the commune members are eating very well. The canteen has planted 36 mu of vegetables and raises 283 pigs. In addition, they also grow some peanuts, soybeans and taro. The canteen processes these into different side dishes such as peanut butter, tofu, and dried tofu, so that commune members can enjoy various pickled side dishes in addition to cooked dishes. From the opening on September 18th to the end of October, the commune members have eaten meat a total of six times.
    The canteen also takes good care of commune members with special circumstances. The team has ten vegetarian commune members, so the canteen has allocated a separate stove for vegetarians to cook their own meals. Special care is also given to postpartum women, the sick, and visiting relatives and friends.
    When it is busy with farming or when commune members are working in distant fields, the cooks deliver the meals to the fields, reducing the time for commune members to travel back and forth to eat, and improving labor efficiency.
    Because the food in the canteen is good, many commune members have gained weight. The bachelor Qiu Tu, who is over sixty years old, used to cook for himself, eating irregularly and inconstantly, and his health was very poor and he was unable to work. Now he eats at the canteen at fixed times, and has hot meals, and his health has gradually improved. In one month, he collected more than 500 jin of manure. Lin Tianlin

### 社员吃胖了

专栏：公共食堂人人夸

    社员吃胖了
    福建仙游县龙华人民公社五明营第三连的公共食堂，有七百二十三人吃饭，由于炊事员的努力，社员们饭菜都吃得很好。食堂种了三十六亩菜，养了二百八十三头猪。另外还种了些花生、大豆和芋头，食堂把这些东西加工成不同的小菜如花生酱、豆腐、豆腐干等，因此社员们除了能吃到熟菜外，也能吃到各种酱小菜。从9月18日开办到10月下旬，社员们一共吃过六次肉了。
    食堂对于一些特殊情况的社员也照顾得很周到。队里有十个吃素的社员，食堂就让出一个锅灶，给吃素的人另外烧饭做菜。对于产妇、病人和来往亲戚朋友，也都另有照顾。
    遇到农忙或是社员在路远的地里干活时，炊事员就把饭菜送到田头去，减少社员往返吃饭的时间，提高了劳动效率。
    由于食堂吃得好，已经有不少社员吃胖了。单身汉丘涂年六十多岁了，过去自己做饭冷一顿热一顿，身体很不好，不能劳动，现在在食堂吃饭定时，又有热菜热饭，身体渐渐好起来，一个月就拣了五百多斤粪。　林天霖
