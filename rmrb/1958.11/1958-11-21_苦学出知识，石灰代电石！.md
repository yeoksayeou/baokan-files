    Diligent Study Yields Knowledge, Lime Substitutes Calcium Carbide!
    Li Zhixiang, Representative of the National Youth Activists Congress, Welder
    Recently, with the help of the Party and comrades, I successfully experimented with a new gas produced from lime and calcium carbide. It is said that no basis for this new gas has been found in world literature, so it cannot be named for the time being. An old professor at the East China Institute of Chemical Technology said to me meaningfully: "Only you so-called people without 'knowledge' can succeed in this experiment. People like us with so-called 'knowledge' can never do it." Indeed, I also find the process of experimenting with this gas very interesting. It tells us what true knowledge is and how to use it.
    I was originally a fifth-grade worker making bakelite buttons. In April, due to the needs of the Great Leap Forward, our factory changed from producing light industrial products such as bakelite buttons to producing an important piece of equipment in the chemical industry – large acid-resistant enamel reaction pots. I was therefore transferred to learn welding techniques.
    "It's foolish to give up being a fifth-grade master and become an apprentice!" Some people gossiped about my job transfer as news. I was a little hesitant at first, but then I thought that I was a member of the Communist Youth League, so I obeyed the assignment without hesitation. At this time, it happened to be payday, and when I looked at the money in my hand, it was the same as before. I hurriedly wrote a report requesting a reduction in my salary, because I felt uneasy. As an apprentice, I study all day and can't take so much! However, in order to encourage everyone to learn new technologies, the leadership decided to transfer me without changing my salary. I felt very uncomfortable taking so much money and was determined to master the new technology as soon as possible and create wealth for the country as soon as possible.
    As soon as I arrived at my new post, I found many novel things, and I couldn't wait to understand them all. The next day, when loading materials, I accidentally dropped a large piece of calcium carbide into the water tank. The water immediately made a hissing sound, and many small bubbles rose up. Why does calcium carbide produce bubbles and hot air when it comes into contact with water? I thought about this question again and again, but I couldn't figure it out. The third day, when I came to the factory, I passed a lime store and found that the situation when lime was stirred in water was the same as when calcium carbide was dropped in water. It suddenly occurred to me that if lime could be used to replace expensive and scarce calcium carbide, how much money would the country save? Our factory alone, with several hundred people, could save more than 100,000 yuan a year!
    At first, I didn't dare to tell anyone about this idea, for fear of being laughed at: "You've only been here for three days, and you're already acting important, starting to invent things. Do you think you can succeed?" Then I immediately thought that I was a member of the Communist Youth League, so all my worries disappeared. I found the Party Branch Secretary on a Sunday and reported to him. The Party Branch Secretary was very happy to hear this and encouraged me to experiment boldly, saying, "If you need anything, just say it, the Party will strongly support you!"
    When I started experimenting, there were many difficulties. I only had a primary school education and no basic knowledge of chemistry, and I didn't have any experimental instruments. But I didn't get discouraged. I borrowed two bowls from the kitchen and started the experiment. I put the same amount of lime and calcium carbide in two bowls, added water, and found that the lime dissolved quickly and the bowl was hot, while the calcium carbide dissolved slowly and the bowl was not very hot. This gave me a preliminary understanding of the general properties of the two raw materials. But after nine experiments, I still hadn't solved the problem of how to use lime instead of calcium carbide. So I asked a master to help me make a small acetylene generator, and after eleven more experiments, I proved that the effect produced by lime plus a small amount of calcium carbide was greater than that of calcium carbide, and this gave me a clue. I then asked the master to help me make a large acetylene generator. The experiment started very smoothly, and the welding nozzle spewed out a strong flame. In less than five minutes, suddenly, with a loud bang, the generator exploded, filling the room with black smoke.
    Just as I was feeling very sad, the Party Branch Secretary came. He said: A member of the Communist Youth League must be able to withstand the test of success and failure. We must find out the reason for this failure. The experiment cannot be abandoned halfway. He also told me to pay attention to safety, and gave me many letters of introduction to find veteran workers and technicians to study with.
    I ran to many welding companies and chemical research units. The workers all encouraged me and helped me find clues. But some of the so-called "experts" who shook their heads replied: "No, no, lime is lime, calcium carbide is calcium carbide; lime is used to build houses, calcium carbide is an industrial raw material, they are completely different things, how can they be mixed together?" "The world has never heard of lime being used to replace calcium carbide. You can't find it even if you search through scientific literature. Don't daydream. Even if you dare to say and dare to think, you must have a basis!" "Comrade, don't go against science, don't take this risk. If it explodes, it will have the power of several hundred pounds of bombs. You won't be able to save your life, and your head will be moved!" "There are more than two hundred welding factories in Shanghai, and thousands of masters. Are they waiting for you to invent it?"
    I visited teachers and friends from house to house, for four or five days, but without any leads. At night, I kept having nightmares of explosions. What should I do? Thinking of many revolutionary fighters, thinking of many creators, I gained courage and continued to use my brain and think of ways. I asked people for advice whenever I had a problem.
    One day, I thought and thought, until I realized in the evening that I hadn't eaten a single meal. I was so hungry that I ate four bowls of rice and two steamed buns in one breath. Hey, my stomach was so full that I felt very uncomfortable and hurried to defecate. As soon as I defecated, the trick suddenly came to me. I thought: People feel comfortable after eating too much and defecating. So, could the explosion of the acetylene generator also be caused by too much gas causing expansion? I immediately got up to find comrades to study.
    After discussing it, everyone decided to put two storage cylinders next to the acetylene generator to regulate the gas. Master Ma helped me prepare for the experiment, and the Party Branch Secretary also sent someone to check the safety equipment. It was time to experiment, and I asked Master Ma to leave, leaving only me there. Because no one was sure whether it would explode. If there was an accident, sacrificing me was a small matter. Master Ma had thirty years of experience and was a national talent, and his family had eight people to support. As for me, I was a young man, not very capable, and had no family burden. But Master Ma refused to leave. I begged him repeatedly, and he reluctantly walked away. The comrades were all worried about me, and thousands of eyes were staring at me from afar. Unexpectedly, the experiment went very smoothly. After a while, the furnace made bursts of hissing sounds, and everything was successful!
    Later, many scientists, engineers, and professors came to see it, even those so-called "experts" who shook their heads came. They conducted a detailed technical appraisal and confirmed that lime can completely replace calcium carbide.

    苦学出知识，石灰代电石！
    全国青年积极分子大会代表、电焊工人　李志祥
    最近，我在党和同志们的帮助下，试验成功了一种用石灰加电石而产生的新气体。据说，这种新的气体在世界文献上还没有找到根据，因此暂时无法定名。华东化工学院一位老教授意味深长地对我说：“这只有你们这些所谓没有‘知识’的人才能试验成功，像我们这些所谓有‘知识’的人是无论如何也搞不出来的。”的确，我也觉得试验这种气体的过程很有意思。它告诉我们什么是真正的知识，怎样运用知识。
    我原来是做胶木钮扣的五级工人。4月间，由于大跃进的需要，我们厂由生产胶木钮扣等轻工业产品改产化学工业中的一种重要设备——大型耐酸搪瓷反应锅，我也因此被调去学习电焊技术。
    “五级老师傅不当，去当艺徒，真是寿头！”有人把我调动工作的事当作新闻传说。我开始也有些踌躇，后来想到自己是共青团员，就毫不犹豫地服从了分配。这时正好发工资，拿到手里一看，竟是原来的数。我急忙打了一个报告要求降低工资，因为我感到不安，当艺徒整天学习，不能拿这样多呀！但是领导上为了鼓励大家学习新技术，决定调职不调薪。我拿了那么多的钱心里直难受，一心想早早掌握新技术，早早给国家创造财富。
    一到新岗位，就发现许多新奇的东西，我恨不得立刻把它们样样弄懂。第二天装料时不小心，把一块很大的电石落到水槽里去了。水里顿时发出嗤嗤的声音，还腾起很多小水泡来。电石碰到水为什么会产生水泡和热气呢？我把这个问题想了又想，总是想不出个名堂来。第三天来厂时经过一家石灰店，发现石灰在水里搅拌时的情景同电石掉在水里的结果一样。我猛然想到，如果能把石灰代替价贵而又缺货的电石来使用，将会给国家节省多少资金？光我们一个几百人的工厂一年就可以节省十几万元呢？
    起先我不敢把这想头讲出来，怕人家耻笑：“才来了三天，就老三老四，搞起发明创造来了，看你搞得成？”后来我立刻又想到自己是共青团员，就一切顾虑都消了。找了个星期天，特意上党支书那儿去汇报。党支书一听大为高兴，鼓励我大胆试验，还说：“你要什么，就开口，党大力支持你！”
    开始试验时，困难重重。我只有高小语文程度，一点化学的基本常识都没有，又没有试验的仪器。但我不气馁，上厨房借到两只碗，试验就开始了。我把同样份量的石灰和电石分放在两只碗里，加进水，结果石灰溶解快，碗烫，电石溶解慢，碗不太烫，这就初步掌握了二种原料的一般性能。但是试验了九次，没解决如何用石灰代替电石的问题。于是请一位老师傅帮忙做了一只小型乙炔发生器，又试验了十一次，证明石灰加上少量电石所产生的作用比电石更大，这就有了眉目了。我又请老师傅帮助做一只大型乙炔发生器。试验开始很顺利，电焊嘴里喷出了强烈的火焰，五分钟不到，突然，轰隆一声巨响，发生器爆炸了，满屋黑烟。
    我正在十分难过的时候，党支书来了。他说：一个共青团员要经受得起成功和失败的考验。这次为什么失败，要找出原因。试验不能半途而废。他还叫我注意安全，又开了许多介绍信让我去找老工人、技术员研究研究。
    我跑了许多电焊公司、化工研究单位。工人们都鼓励我，还帮我找线索。可是有些所谓“专家”的摇头派，却这样回答：“不行不行，石灰是石灰，电石是电石；石灰是造房子用的，电石是工业原料，根本两回事，怎么能混在一起？”“世界上从没听说过可以用石灰代替电石的，找遍科学文献也找不到，别异想天开吧，敢说敢想也得有个根据！”“小同志，不要违背科学，不要冒这个险，如果爆炸，有几百磅炸弹的威力，命也保不住，头也要搬场！”“上海有两百多家电焊工厂，几千个老师傅，还等你来发明？”
    我寻师访友地挨家访问，跑了四、五天，毫无头绪。晚上又不断做着爆炸的恶梦。怎么办呢？想到许多革命战士，想到许多创造者，我勇气就来了，继续不断动脑筋、想办法，一有问题就求教人。
    有一天，我想呀想的，直到晚上才发现一顿饭也没吃。肚子饿得要命，一口气吃了四碗饭两个馒头。嘿，肚子涨饱了，很难受，急着去大便。一大便，窍门忽然来了。我想：人吃得太涨，一大便就舒服了，那末，乙炔发生器的爆炸是否也是气体太多造成膨胀的缘故呢？我马上站起去找同志研究。
    大家议论后决定在乙炔发生器旁边放两个储筒器，用来调节气体，马师傅帮我做好了试验前的准备工作，党支书还专门派人来检查了安全设备。要试验了，我请马师傅离开，只让我一个人在。因为会不会爆炸，谁也没把握。万一发生意外，牺牲我是小事。马师傅已有三十年工龄，是国家的一个人材，况且家里有八口人要他负担。我呢，毛头小伙子，本事不大，家里也没负担。但是马师傅不肯走，急得我再三恳求，他才依依不舍，勉强走开。同志们都为我担心着，千百只眼睛远远盯住我。不料试验进行得很顺利，一会儿，炉里发出阵阵嗤嗤声，一切都成功了！
    后来许多科学家、工程师、教授都来看了，连原来那些所谓“专家”的摇头派都来了。他们做了细致的技术鉴定，证实石灰完全可以代替电石。
