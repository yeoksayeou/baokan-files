Replanting and Fertilizing Should Be Done as Early as Possible
Yiliang, Yuxi, and Other Places in Yunnan Make a Concentrated Effort in Small Spring Field Management

According to Yunnan Daily, Yiliang County, Yunnan, is seizing the opportunity to mobilize the entire population to inspect and evaluate the planted small spring crops plot by plot, break through the emergence barrier, and strive for full seedling emergence for small spring crops.

Cadres and the masses in Yiliang County have learned from past experience that planting small spring crops is only the first hurdle to achieving a large increase in production. There are three more hurdles to overcome (namely, the emergence hurdle, the survival, growth, and strengthening hurdle, and the natural disaster hurdle). If any hurdle is not overcome well, there is no guarantee for the great leap forward in small spring crops. In the later stage of autumn planting, they proposed: "Mending clothes should be done while they are small, treating illnesses should be done early, and the emergence hurdle for small spring crops should also be overcome early." Before the end of autumn planting, each commune organized inspection teams composed of middle-level cadres and experienced farmers to conduct a comprehensive inspection and evaluation of the planted small spring crops. The method is to inspect and evaluate while finding the reasons, mobilizing the masses to speak out and debate, find solutions and measures, and make up for whatever is lacking until the small spring crops have fully emerged and the cultivation reaches the standard of horticulture.

Yuejin People's Commune inspected and evaluated 145 mu of broad beans in the first battalion and first company, and the emergence situation was divided into three categories: the first category of fields had 30 mu, with an emergence rate of over 90%; the second category of fields had 30 mu, with an emergence rate of about 70%; and the third category of fields had 85 mu, with an emergence rate of 50%, of which 25 mu had an emergence rate of less than 40%. After the inspection team analyzed on the edge of the field, the main reasons were found to be: the first category of fields were planted early and adhered to the quality of autumn planting, and the seedlings emerged evenly. When planting the second category of fields, the cadres in the battalion saw that the harvesting and planting tasks were large, the quality requirements were high, and time was urgent, and their confidence began to waver. They did not grasp the quality of autumn planting tightly enough, and there were shortcomings such as not finely crushing the soil, insufficient fertilizer, and irregular arrangement of ditches and ridges, so the seedlings did not emerge well. The quality of the third category of fields was even worse, with shallow plowing, unbroken clods, insufficient fertilizer, and even some fields with white seeds planted. After the reasons were found, a commune member meeting was immediately held to mobilize commune members to debate issues such as "Do we want high yields for small spring crops? Can the current quality guarantee high yields for small spring crops? How to remedy it?" The commune members made sharp criticisms of the cadres in the battalion, criticizing them for wavering in their thinking and not listening to the opinions of the masses, resulting in delays in the autumn planting season and wasted seeds. Subsequently, the commune members put forward remedial measures for each type of field. After the meeting, action was immediately organized, and horse-drawn carts were dispatched overnight to Beiji Village, 18 kilometers away, to bring back 3,000 jin of bean seeds. The next morning, led by the battalion commander, the commune members launched a concentrated effort to make up for the missed lessons, working hard for two days and nights, and all 145 mu of broad beans were replanted according to plan. In the inspection and evaluation, the first brigade of Panjiang Commune found that 20% of the wheat in the seventh team had not sprouted, so they organized commune members to debate in the fields. Everyone said: If the seedlings don't emerge evenly, who are we going to ask for wheat? If we are careless now, how can we increase production of small spring crops next year? Everyone decided to make a concentrated effort to make up for the missed lessons overnight.

(Xinhua News Agency) Kunming, Yunnan, November 21st. This newspaper reports that Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, has strengthened the field management of small spring crops, turning drought-stricken wheat and rapeseed from yellow to green, and small spring crops that had not sprouted have sprouted new buds.

Some of the early-planted small spring crops in Yuxi County turned yellow due to the winter drought; later-planted small spring crops also did not sprout due to lack of water. The county party committee promptly mobilized all farmers in the county to do everything possible to ensure that each mu of small spring crops was thoroughly irrigated twice from now until the ears emerge. In areas with long-flowing water and dammed ponds, ditches were dug and repaired for irrigation; in areas along the lake, water was pumped for irrigation; and in mountainous areas with distant water sources and water shortages, water was transported for irrigation using animal power and improved tools. After extensive debate by the masses, the county quickly organized an army of about 10,000 people to fight drought and protect seedlings, active on three fronts: the lake, the plains, and the mountains.

In the plains with water, thanks to the efforts of the water conservancy vanguard company, 21 medium-sized reservoirs and more than 1,500 small dams and ponds were closed half a month earlier than in previous years, and more than 800 people were organized to repair the main channels leading to various people's communes, and dozens of ditches were built. When releasing water, the method of releasing water to distant fields first, then to nearby fields, first to withered yellow seedling fields and fields that have not sprouted, and then to general fields, and checking before releasing water was adopted to ensure that small spring crops were irrigated in time.

In areas along the lake and rivers, pumps and manual waterwheels were set up to lift lake and river water and lead it to fields one to two miles away.

In areas lacking water, the masses generally adopted methods such as sending people to find water sources, combining small water sources into large water sources, concentrating scattered water for use, digging underground dragon water, and using animal power and improved tools to transport water, persisting in drought resistance.

Through the efforts of the people of the whole county, in a very short period of time, more than 50,000 mu of small spring crops in the county have been irrigated once, and the already drought-stricken wheat and rapeseed have turned from yellow to green, and the small spring crops that have not sprouted have sprouted new buds.

### 补苗补肥越早越好  云南宜良玉溪等地突击小春田间管理

    补苗补肥越早越好
    云南宜良玉溪等地突击小春田间管理
    据云南日报消息　云南宜良县抓紧时机，全民动员，逐丘排队检查评比种下的小春作物，大破出苗关，力争小春作物全苗。
    宜良县的干部和群众从过去经验中体会到，小春种下去只是闯过了大增产的头道关，以后还要过三关（即出苗关，保活保长保壮关，自然灾害关），任何一关过不好，小春大跃进都没有保证。秋种后期，他们就提出意见：“补衣趁小，治病趁早，小春过出苗关也要赶早。”不等秋种结束，各公社就组织有中队干部和老农参加的检查团，对已种下的小春，来一次普遍查评验收。办法是边查评，边找原因，边发动群众鸣放辩论，想办法，找措施，缺什么课补上什么课，直到小春全苗，耕作达到园艺化的标准为止。
    跃进人民公社查评验收了一营一连的一百四十五亩蚕豆，出苗情况有三种：一类田有三十亩，出苗率占90％以上；二类田三十亩，出苗率70％左右；三类田八十五亩，出苗率50％，其中有二十五亩出苗率还不到40％。经过检查团在田边分析，找出的主要原因是：一类田种得早，坚持了秋种质量，苗出的齐。种二类田的时候，营里的干部看到收种任务大，质量又要求高，时间急，信心开始动摇，对秋种质量抓的不够紧，有碎土不细、肥料不足和沟、墒整理得不规矩等毛病，苗出的不好。三类田质量更差，犁不深，垡不碎，肥不足，甚至有少部分田点了白籽。原因找出来以后，马上召开社员大会，发动社员辩论“要不要小春高产，像现在这种质量能不能保证小春高产，怎样补救”等问题。社员们对营里的干部提出了尖锐的批评，批评他们思想动摇，不听群众的意见，结果是既拖迟了秋种节令，又浪费了种籽。接着，社员们又对各类田分别提出了补救的措施。会后，马上组织行动，连夜派出马车到十八公里外的北吉村拉回三千斤豆种，第二天一早，由营长率领社员突击补课，苦战了两昼夜，一百四十五亩蚕豆全部按计划补上了。盘江社一大队在查评验收中发现七中队的小麦有20％未出芽，就组织社员在田边辩论，大家说：苗出不齐，去问谁要麦子？现在马虎，明年小春怎样增产？大家决定连夜突击补课。
    本报讯　云南省玉溪县加强小春作物的田间管理，使受旱小麦、油菜由黄转绿，没有出芽的小春作物冒出了新芽。
    玉溪县部分早种的小春作物，曾因冬旱发黄；后种的小春作物，也因缺水没有出苗。该县县委及时动员全县农民，千方百计让每亩小春从现在到结穗，大润两次。在有长流水、坝塘水的地区开沟、修沟对水灌溉；沿湖地区提水灌溉；水源较远和缺水的山地运水灌溉。经过群众大鸣大放大辩论，全县很快就组织了一支约一万人的抗旱保苗大军，活跃在湖边、平坝、山地等三条战线上。
    在平坝有水的地区，由于水利尖兵连的努力，二十一个中型水库，一千五百多个小型坝塘都较往年提前半月关上了水，并组织了八百多人整修了通往各人民公社的主要沟道；兴修了几十条水沟。放水时，采取先放远田，后放近田，先放枯黄苗田和不出芽的田，后放一般的田，先检查后放水的办法，保证小春及时得到灌溉。
    在沿湖靠河地区，架设抽水机、人力水车，将湖水、河水提起来，引到一至二里以外的田地里去。
    在缺水的地方，广大群众普遍采取派人寻找水源，小水并大水，将散水集中起来用，挖地龙水，用畜力和改进工具运送水等办法，坚持抗旱。
    经过全县人民的努力，在很短的时间内，全县已有五万多亩小春作物润了一道水，已经干旱的小麦、油菜由黄转绿，没有出芽的小春作物冒出了新芽。
