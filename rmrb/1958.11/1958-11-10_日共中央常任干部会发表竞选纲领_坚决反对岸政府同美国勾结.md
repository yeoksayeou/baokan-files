Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th dispatch: TASS Tokyo, 9th dispatch: "Akahata" published the Japanese Communist Party Central Standing Committee's election platform for the House of Councillors and local government institutions. The elections are scheduled to be held in April and May 1959, respectively.

The platform points out that Japan is currently in a position of subordination to the United States, and imperialists are preparing for atomic war. Under these circumstances, the Nobusuke Kishi government is openly adopting a policy of reviving imperialism and militarism, while simultaneously intensifying its attacks on the rights and interests of the people. The platform states that the government is implementing a policy of collusion with the United States, supporting U.S. aggression against China, obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, attempting to revive the arbitrary police system, and pursuing nuclear armament domestically. The Japanese Communist Party Central Standing Committee platform points out that these reactionary measures do not demonstrate the current government's strength, but rather show that it is increasingly difficult for the government to maintain its rule using past, sham-democratic methods.

The Standing Committee calls on the Japanese working people, led by the working class, to intensify their struggle for their own rights and pay attention to the growing desire for unity among all democratic forces in order to gradually isolate the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the government. The Standing Committee said, "The contradiction and struggle between democratic forces and reactionary forces has now entered a new and decisive stage."

The Japanese Communist Party Central Standing Committee points out that as the election date approaches, the struggle between reactionary forces and democratic forces is becoming increasingly acute. Therefore, it calls on Communists to play a vanguard role in the people's struggle against the reactionary government, explain the party's policies to the masses, and increase the number of people who support the party.

The platform points out that in the upcoming elections and during the election preparation process, Communists must fight against the Kishi Nobusuke government's collusion with the United States to aggress against China, and must strive for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Taiwan area, the restoration of diplomatic relations with China, the immediate signing of a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, the abolition of U.S. bases in Japan, and the abrogation of all unequal treaties and agreements signed between Japan and the United States.

The Japanese Communist Party Central Standing Committee points out that all democratic forces must unite, and calls on the Socialist Party and other democratic groups in Japan to form a united front in the elections.

    日共中央常任干部会发表竞选纲领
    坚决反对岸政府同美国勾结
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社东京9日讯：“赤旗报”刊载了日本共产党中央常任干部会关于国会参议院和地方政权机构竞选纲领。这次选举订于1959年4月和5月分别举行。
    纲领指出，目前日本处于从属美国的地位，帝国主义者正在准备原子战争，在这种情况下，岸信介政府公开采取复活帝国主义和军国主义的方针，同时加紧进攻人民的权利和利益。纲领中说，政府执行同美国勾结的政策，支持美国对中国的侵略行动，阻挠同苏联缔结和约，企图复活警察专横的制度，在国内进行核武装。日共中央常任干部会纲领中指出，这些反动措施不但不能说明现政府强有力，反而说明政府越来越难以用过去的假民主办法来维持统治。
    常任干部会号召以工人阶级为首的日本劳动人民为切身权利而加紧斗争，注意日益增长的要求一切民主力量团结的愿望，逐步孤立执政的自由民主党和政府。常任干部会说，“民主力量和反动势力之间的矛盾和斗争现在已经进入新的决定性阶段。”
    日本共产党中央常任干部会指出，随着选举日期的迫近，反动势力和民主力量之间的斗争日益尖锐，因此它号召共产党人在人民反对反动政府的斗争中起先锋作用，向群众解释党的政策，增加拥护党的人数。
    纲领指出，在即将举行的选举当中和竞选准备过程中，共产党人必须为反对岸信介政府同美国勾结侵略中国而斗争，必须为争取美军立即撤出台湾地区、同中国恢复外交关系、立即同苏联签订和约、取消美国在日本的基地、废除日本同美国签订的一切不平等条约和协定而斗争。
    日本共产党中央常任干部会指出，一切民主力量必须团结起来，并且呼吁社会党和日本其他民主团体在竞选中结成统一战线。
