Only Originality, No Imitation
Discussing Agricultural Mechanization Research Under the Circumstances of Large-Scale High-Yield Harvests
Tao Dinglai

Over the past year, high-yield "satellites" of various crops have continuously emerged, which is a revolutionary and significant event in the development of agricultural production and agricultural science in our country.

The high yields in agriculture, especially the achievements of the "satellite" fields, have affirmed a series of agricultural technology measures for achieving high yields. In summary, these are the five measures of "water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density." In the past, many people believed that it was difficult to increase crop yields and difficult to grasp the rules. Now, after the creative labor of hundreds of millions of farmers in our country, it has been proven that the methods for increasing yields are not mysterious. No matter what crop, no matter in what region, as long as these five measures are implemented, high yields can be achieved. The central government's instructions on deep plowing and soil improvement further point out that deep plowing is the center of these five measures.

However, the large-scale promotion of these measures first encounters the difficulty of insufficient labor. Therefore, agricultural high yields urgently require the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification. What are the existing problems in agricultural mechanization and electrification? The most prominent issue is that many of the agricultural tools we used to use and considered relatively good in the past are now unsuitable due to the requirements of deep plowing and close planting; tractors that were considered very good in the past are no longer popular because they cannot perform deep plowing. Admittedly, through the tool reform movement, we have created many valuable agricultural implements in the past year, and with the modification of existing implements, some problems can be solved. But in general, the progress in agricultural mechanization and electrification has not kept up with the requirements of high-yield agriculture. This contradiction will become more obvious when larger-scale high-yield harvests are required in the future. Here are a few practical examples to illustrate this.

First is the issue of deep plowing implements. Since deep plowing was confirmed as an important measure for high yields, the inability of our original tractors and plows to meet the requirements has been exposed. In the past, we had experience in increasing production through mechanized farming, but the increase was generally only a few tens of percent, far from being comparable to the several or dozens of times increase in this year's "satellite fields." The original plows had a plowing depth of only 22 to 25 centimeters, but now, high-yield fields require a plowing depth of more than two feet (more than 66 centimeters). In order to meet the new requirements, deep plowing implements have been widely modified throughout the country. The main method is to add a subsoil shovel behind the plowshare to increase the overall plowing depth. This kind of modification has many advantages, such as being able to utilize existing implements, facilitating rapid promotion, preventing the subsoil from being turned over, and basically meeting agricultural requirements, etc. However, up to now, the plowing depth obtained through such modifications is rarely able to reach 50 centimeters, and the lower layer of crushed soil is generally poor, making it difficult to apply large amounts of fertilizer to the deep layer. More importantly, using such a plow for deep plowing requires a lot of resistance. In order for the tractor to be able to pull it, the plowing width has to be greatly reduced, such as changing a five-bottom plow to a three-bottom or two-bottom plow, and a three-bottom plow to a single-bottom plow, etc. Reducing the plowing width creates difficulties in the tractor's off-center pulling, preventing it from working normally. Therefore, these modification methods cannot perfectly meet the requirements.

Harvesting is also a prominent problem. We have imported many types of grain combine harvesters from foreign countries and regarded them as relatively advanced agricultural machinery. However, they are only suitable for grains with yields of less than 500 or 600 jin per mu. Working in fields with higher yields will cause clogging and increase losses, making them unusable.

The requirements for operating machinery inevitably affect the form of operating power. The cable-traction machine powered by mechanical and electrical power, which was successfully developed not long ago, has important significance in the history of agricultural machinery development in our country. Cable traction is particularly suitable for deep plowing. Compared with the many advantages of cable traction, the idea that tractors are the only direction for achieving agricultural mechanization has been shaken, at least in the paddy fields of southern China. Even in the plains of northern China, if tractors cannot solve the problem of deep plowing and cannot reduce the amount of metal used, then whether they can still be the main form of rural power is also doubtful (of course, tractors can still do a lot of work in comprehensive utilization with rural transportation). At present, we are vigorously promoting various types of cable-traction machines, which play a decisive role in completing deep plowing tasks. However, there are not many operating machines applied to cable-traction machines, and the cable-traction plows cannot yet adapt to relatively deep cultivation. Designing and manufacturing complete sets of cable-traction implements so that they can achieve comprehensive utilization in various operations is the urgent task we are now facing.

The development of China's agricultural economy, the achievements of people's communes, and the leaps forward in industry, especially the leaps forward in important products such as electricity, fuel, and steel, will prepare extremely favorable conditions for agricultural mechanization and electrification. In the first eight months of this year, more than 230 types of tractors were trial-produced across the country. This situation is unprecedented in our country and unique in other countries in the world. The problem now is: agriculture has needs, and industry can manufacture, so we should decide what to manufacture as soon as possible. Failure to solve this problem quickly will definitely seriously affect the progress of agricultural mechanization and electrification in our country.

To create our own agricultural implements, we must break away from dogmatism in agricultural machinery science and the idea of blindly believing in foreign countries. In the past, many people believed that to achieve agricultural mechanization and electrification in our country, we could only learn from foreign countries and follow the path that others have taken. In the promotion of new agricultural implements and mechanical agricultural implements, the main focus was on introducing and imitating (although some improvements were also made). In research work, it was generally impossible to boldly break the shackles of foreign theories. This was especially obvious among intellectual researchers. The National Agricultural Implements Exhibition this year exhibited more than 3,000 types of agricultural implements created by the working people of our country, of which very few were independently created by scientific research institutions, which fully illustrates the seriousness of our detachment from the actual production of our country and the constraints imposed by foreign design ideas.

Why is it difficult for existing plows to exceed 50 centimeters in plowing depth? This is a thought-provoking question. Experience tells us that if we use manual excavation to deep-plow three to five feet, it is not very difficult (the amount of labor required is another issue). Therefore, as long as we change the design of deep-plowing tools, power can be used to achieve deep-plowing requirements. The current situation of plows (and subsoil shovels) entering the soil is similar to driving piles into the ground to some extent. We know that piles are difficult to move in the soil because they will squeeze the soil, and the soil can withstand very high squeezing pressure. The situation of using a shovel to cut the soil is completely different. Can we use the principle of the shovel or other more effective methods of cutting the soil to design deep-plowing machinery? It is entirely possible.

The same is true for harvesting. In order to harvest grain, the original grain combine harvesters consumed a lot of power in hitting the grain stalks and cleaning the grain from the stalks. It should be said that this is a very unreasonable method. The simple harvester successfully trial-produced by the Agricultural Machinery Research Institute of the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery has proven that we can completely avoid letting crop stalks pass through the threshing drum, thereby reducing the load on the threshing drum, improving work efficiency, and making the harvester suitable for grains with yields of around 2,000 jin per mu. This is already a step up from foreign harvesting machinery. For cable-traction implements, it is even more necessary to rely on ourselves to develop relevant design theories.

In order to create agricultural machinery unique to our country, we must also mobilize and rely on the broad masses of workers and peasants to participate in experimental research work. Intellectuals must go deep into actual production and learn from the experience of the peasants. The method of deep-plowing soil created by Comrade Ma Tongyi of Changge County, Henan Province, is the best basis for designing deep-plowing implements. The same is true for research on biogas, internal combustion water pumps, and various cable-traction machines. We believe that a series of machines for deep plowing, close planting, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting required for high crop yields will also be solved soon.

    只能独创  不能模仿
    谈大面积丰产形势下的农业机械化研究工作
    陶鼎来
    一年来，各种农作物高额丰产“卫星”不断出现，这是我国农业生产和农业科学发展中具有革命性的重大事件。
    农业的丰产，特别是“卫星”田的成就，肯定了一系列丰产的农业技术措施，归纳起来，就是“水、肥、土、种、密”五项。过去许多人认为提高作物的产量很困难，很难掌握其中规律，现在经过我国亿万农民创造性的劳动，证明提高产量的办法并不神秘，无论什么作物，无论在什么地区，只要做到了这五项措施，就都可以得到丰产。中央在深耕和改良土壤的指示中，更指出深耕是这五项措施的中心。
    但是，在大面积上推广这些措施，首先就遇到劳力不足的困难。因此农业丰产迫切要求实现农业机械化和电气化。目前在农业机械化电气化方面所存在的问题是什么呢？最突出的是许多我们过去所惯用的，而且也认为是比较好的农具，现在由于要求深耕密植变为不适用的了；过去认为很好的拖拉机，因为不能深耕，就不再受欢迎了。诚然经过工具改革运动，一年来我们创造了许多有价值的农业机具，加上改装原有的机具，可以解决一些问题。但总的说来，农业机械化与电气化方面的进展，还赶不上丰产农业的要求。这个矛盾在今后要求更大规模的大面积丰产的时候，就会更加明显地表现出来。下面举几个实际例子说明。
    首先是深耕农具问题。自从肯定了深耕是丰产的重要措施以后，我们原有的拖拉机和机耕犁不能满足要求的情况就暴露出来了。过去我们曾经有机耕增产的经验，但增产的幅度一般不过百分之几十，远不能与今年“卫星田”增产几倍、几十倍相比。原有的机耕犁耕深不过二十二至二十五公分，现在，丰产田都要求耕深二尺（六十六公分多）以上。为了适应新的要求，全国各地已经在普遍改装深耕农具，主要的办法是在犁铧后加松土铲，来增加总的耕深。这样的改装有许多优点，如能利用现有农具，便于迅速推广，能使下层生土不上翻，基本上满足了农业要求等等。但到现在为止，经过这样改装所得到的耕深，还很少能达到五十公分，下层碎土一般不良，不便于向深层施用大量肥料。更重要的是用这样的犁来深耕，阻力很大，为使拖拉机能够牵引，不得不大大减少耕幅，如须把五铧犁改为三铧或二铧，三铧犁改为单铧等，而减小耕幅又造成拖拉机偏牵引的困难，不能正常工作。因此用这些改装方法，还不能完善地达到要求。
    收获问题，也很突出。我们曾从外国引进许多种型号的谷物联合收割机，并且当作是比较先进的农业机械。但是它们只适用于亩产五六百斤以下的谷物。在更高产量的田里工作，就会发生堵塞和加大损失，不能使用。
    对作业机械的要求，必然影响到作业动力的形式。不久前研究成功的机力和电力绳索牵引机，在我国农业机械发展史上有着重要的意义。绳索牵引特别适用于深耕。与绳索牵引所具备的许多优点相比，拖拉机作为实现农业机械化的唯一方向，目前至少在我国南方的水田地区，是已经动摇了。即令在北方平原地区，如果拖拉机不能解决深耕问题，不能降低金属用量，那么是否还能作为农村动力的主要形式，也是值得怀疑的（当然与农村运输综合利用，拖拉机还可以做许多工作）。目前我们正在大力推广各种型式的绳索牵引机，对完成深耕任务，有决定性的作用。但是应用在绳索牵引机上的作业机械还不多，绳索牵引的犁也还不能适应比较深的耕作。设计制造成套的绳索牵引机具，使能在各种作业上实现综合利用，是我们现在面临的迫切任务。
    我国农业经济的发展，人民公社化的成就，以及工业方面的跃进，特别是电力、燃料、钢铁等重要产品的跃进，将为农业机械化电气化准备了极为有利的条件。全国各地在今年的前八个月内，就试制成拖拉机二百三十多种。这种形势，是我国过去从来没有的，也是世界其它国家所没有的。现在的问题是：农业方面有需要，工业方面能制造，应当尽快地决定制造什么。这一问题不很快解决，肯定将严重地影响我国农业机械化电气化的进展。
    要创造我们自己的农业机具，就必须摆脱在农业机械科学方面的教条主义和迷信外国的观点。过去很多人认为我国要实现农业机械化和电气化，只有向外国学习，走人家走过的道路。在推广新式农具与机械农具方面，主要的是引进和仿制（虽然也作某些改进）。在研究工作上，一般的也不能大胆破除外国理论的束缚。这在知识分子研究人员中，尤为明显。今年全国农具展览会上展出了我国劳动人民创造的农具三千多种，其中由科学研究机关独立创造的极少，充分说明了我们脱离本国生产实际，受到国外设计思想束缚的严重程度。
    为什么以现有的犁，耕深很难超过五十公分，是耐人寻思的问题。经验告诉我们，如果用人工挖掘，深翻三尺至五尺，并不十分困难（用工多少是另一问题）。因此只要改变深耕工具的设计、动力是可以用来达到深耕要求的。现有的犁（及松土铲）进入土壤的情况，在某种程度上与向地下打的桩相似。我们知道桩子很难在土壤中移动，因为它将挤压土壤，而土壤可以承受很高的挤压力。用锹来切削土壤的情况，就完全不同。我们是否可以利用锹的原理或其它更有效的切削土壤的方法来设计深耕机械呢？完全可能。
    收割问题也是这样。为了收获谷粒，原有的谷物联合收割机消耗了很大的功率在打击谷物稿秆和在稿秆中清选出谷粒上。应当说这是很不合理的方法。一机部农业机械研究所试制成功的简易收割机证明我们完全有可能不让作物稿秆通过脱粒滚筒，从而减少脱粒滚筒的负荷，提高工作效率，使收割机适应亩产二千斤左右的谷物。这已经比国外的收割机械提高了一步。对绳索牵引的机具来说，更有必要依靠我们自己来发展有关的设计理论。
    为了创造我国独有的农业机械，还必须发动和依靠广大的工人、农民参加试验研究工作。知识分子则必须深入实际生产，学习农民的经验。河南省长葛县马同义同志创造的深翻土壤的方法，就是设计深耕农具的最好根据。其他如对沼气，内燃水泵，各种绳索牵引机等的研究，也是如此。我们相信为作物丰产所需要的深耕、密植、灌溉、施肥、收获等一系列机械，必然也会很快解决。
