    Water Conservancy Construction Tasks Are Large, Deadlines Are Short, and Manpower Is Limited. What Should We Do?
    Carry Out a High-Efficiency Movement by Reforming Technology
    (Our Dispatch) A mass movement to increase work efficiency, with the central tenets of vigorously reforming technology, rationally organizing labor, and properly arranging living conditions, has been vigorously launched on water conservancy construction sites across the country. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, since the winter repairs on water conservancy projects began across the country, the average earth and stone work efficiency per person per day on most construction sites has reached more than five cubic meters, which is more than double the national average daily work efficiency of earth and stone work last winter and this spring. Since the start of winter repairs in Shandong, Gansu, and other provinces, the average daily work efficiency per person has exceeded ten cubic meters of earth and stone. In the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province, the Changde Special Zone's 100,000-strong water conservancy army recently completed 4 million cubic meters of earthwork in one day. Thirty-nine advanced units averaged more than 100 cubic meters of work efficiency per person per day.
    This winter and next spring's water conservancy battle is our "Huaihai Campaign" to basically realize water conservancy. Vigorously engaging in a mass technological reform movement centered on improving construction tools and doubling work efficiency is of decisive significance in ensuring the victory of this battle. According to local plans, the amount of earth and stone work this winter and next spring will increase two to three times compared to last winter and this spring. And the steel and agricultural production fronts will be very busy this winter and next spring, and labor allocation will inevitably be more strained than last winter and this spring. Therefore, in response to this situation, many provinces and regions put forward the slogan of a high-efficiency movement as soon as they started work this year.
    In order to improve work efficiency, all provinces and regions are vigorously carrying out tool reforms, striving for semi-mechanization of construction, mechanization of earthwork, and factory-ization of construction sites. According to incomplete statistics from eight provinces and regions, including Hunan, Shanxi, and Guangxi, more than 20 million improved tools of various types have been promoted at water conservancy construction sites. The work efficiency of these tools is generally several times to dozens of times higher than in the past. Factories serving tool reform and project needs, such as tool factories, explosives factories, cement factories, lime kilns, and brick and tile factories, are also being built in large numbers on water conservancy construction sites across the country. More than 30,000 native cement factories have been established in only six provinces including Henan and Shandong, and more than 400 explosives factories have been built in three provinces including Hubei and Zhejiang.
    Some construction sites have basically achieved semi-mechanization due to good tool reforms. On many construction sites of the Yinqiao project in Gansu Province, the amount of earth and stone work completed after semi-mechanization has increased more than tenfold.
    The Shanmen People's Commune in Dongkou County, Hunan Province, built ten temporary factories at the Zuta Reservoir construction site and relied on its own strength to solve the difficulties of lacking equipment, and also realized the factory-ization of the construction site and the semi-mechanization of construction, saving a large amount of labor. The work efficiency of the entire reservoir project was therefore increased by more than six times. Since the official start of construction at the end of October, although only more than 400 people have been working every day, most of whom are auxiliary labor, and the main labor force is only more than 100 people, they have still built culverts and spillways, and the earth dam has also been built more than two feet high, and it is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
    The use of advanced large-scale blasting technology to excavate earth and stone is also a powerful measure taken by various places to improve work efficiency. In previous years, large-scale blasting was generally only used for large-scale projects to mine stone. This year, it has begun to be widely used in medium-sized and small projects. After adopting this advanced technology in various places, the work efficiency is generally dozens or even hundreds of times higher than before.
    In order to improve work efficiency, various water conservancy construction sites also pay great attention to improving labor organization and the lives of migrant workers. Most of the water conservancy armies in various places are organized in accordance with the militarized organization of the commune, and are formed into water conservancy corps, which set up large camps on the construction site. Anhui Province also formed assault combat organizations such as blasting companies, engineering companies, and arsenals (tool factories) according to labor strength and technical expertise. These corps move quickly and can highly exert collective wisdom and collaborative power. In addition, the party committees of each construction site vigorously grasped eating (running the canteen well) and sleeping, and the migrant workers ate and slept well and had sufficient energy. Therefore, work efficiency has improved particularly quickly. (Attached picture)

### 水利建设任务大，日期短，人力少，怎么办？  革新技术开展高工效运动

    水利建设任务大，日期短，人力少，怎么办？
    革新技术开展高工效运动
    本报讯　以大力革新技术、合理组织劳力和妥善安排生活为内容的提高工效的群众运动，已经在全国水利工地上蓬勃展开。据农业部了解，全国水利工程冬修开工以来，大部分工地每人每日的土石方平均工效已达到五方以上，比去冬今春全国的土石方平均日工效提高了一倍多。山东、甘肃等省冬修开工以来的每人每日平均工效，土石方已经突破十方。湖南省洞庭湖滨常德专区十万水利大军，前些天，一天完成土方四百万公方，有三十九个先进单位平均每人每日的工效已达到一百公方以上。
    今冬明春的水利战役是我国基本实现水利化的“淮海大战”。大搞以改良施工工具为中心的群众性技术改革运动，成倍地提高工效，对保证这个战役的胜利具有决定性意义。据各地规划，今冬明春土石方数量较去冬今春增加两倍到三倍。而今冬明春钢铁和农业生产战线都十分繁忙，劳力调配势必比去冬今春更为紧张。因此，针对这种情况，许多省区今年一开工就提出了高工效运动的口号。
    为了提高工效，各省区都大搞工具改革，力争施工半机械化、土机械化、工地工厂化。据湖南、山西、广西等八个省区的不完全统计，各水利工地已推广各种改良工具两千多万件。这些工具的工效一般都比过去提高了数倍至数十倍。服务于工具改革和工程需要的工具厂、炸药厂、水泥厂、石灰窑、砖瓦厂等工厂，也都在各地水利工地上大量兴建起来。仅河南、山东等六省已经建立起来的土水泥厂就有三万多个，湖北、浙江等三省还建起炸药厂四百多处。
    有些工地由于工具改革得好，已经基本上实现了半机械化。甘肃省引洮工程的许多工地，半机械化后完成的土石方猛增十倍多。
    湖南省洞口县山门人民公社在祖塔水库工地修建起十个临时工厂，靠自己力量解决了缺乏器材的困难，而且实现工地工厂化、施工半机械化，节省了大批劳动力。全部水库工程的工效因此即提高了六倍多。从10月末正式开工以来，每天虽然只有四百多人上工，其中大部分又都是辅助劳动力，主要劳动力只不过一百余人，但仍然修好了涵管、溢洪道，土坝也已筑起二尺多高了，预计年底可以全部竣工。
    采用大爆破的先进技术开采土石方也是各地提高工效的一项有力措施。往年大爆破一般只用于大型工程开采石方，今年已开始普遍用于中、小型工程。各地采用这种先进技术以后，工效一般地比采用前提高数十倍甚至百倍。
    为了提高工效，各水利工地还十分注意改进劳力组织和民工生活。各地水利大军大都是按公社军事化组织，编成水利兵团，就工地扎大营。安徽省还按劳力强弱和技术专长，组成爆破连、工兵连、兵工厂（工具厂）等突击战斗组织。这些兵团行动神速，能高度发挥集体智慧和协作力量。加上各工地党委大力抓吃（办好食堂）、抓睡，民工吃好睡好干劲足。所以，工效提高得特别快。（附图片）
