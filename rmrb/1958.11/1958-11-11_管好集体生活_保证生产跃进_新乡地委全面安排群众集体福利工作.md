    Manage Collective Life Well, Ensure a Leap in Production
    Xinxiang Prefectural Committee Makes Comprehensive Arrangements for Mass Collective Welfare Work
    Our newspaper Zhengzhou, 10th dispatch: In order to further improve the lives of the masses, promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and consolidate the people's communes, the CCP Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of Henan Province recently proposed to ensure that the broad masses of commune members eat well, dress warmly, sleep well, that the elderly are cared for, and that young children are educated, so that everyone is satisfied with their life and everyone is mentally comfortable.
    At present, collectivized living has been generally implemented in the Xinxiang area. Collective welfare undertakings are generally well-run, but there are also many problems.
    Based on this, the CCP Xinxiang Prefectural Committee has taken corresponding measures to further improve the welfare work of the masses' lives. First, the Prefectural Committee requires the party committees at all levels of the commune and all party member cadres to fully recognize the relationship between running socialist collective welfare undertakings well and developing production. Doing a good job in welfare work, ensuring that commune members have strong bodies, high spirits, and high labor efficiency, is precisely to further ensure a greater leap in production; therefore, the masses' living problems such as food and clothing should be placed on the shoulders of leaders at all levels, just like leading production.
    Second, run public canteens well. To ensure that everyone eats their fill and eats well, strive to ensure that each person can eat three qian of oil, five qian of salt, and two jin of fresh vegetables every day. Achieve diversification of meals, and turn sweet potatoes into bread and pastries, so that meals do not repeat within a week. The canteen management work should conscientiously implement the class line, and the management personnel and cooks should be universally reviewed again to clean out all bad elements. Recently, the weather has gradually turned cold, and it is required that all canteens in the region be simplified into dining halls within ten days to ensure that commune members eat hot meals and hot dishes.
    Third, special emphasis should be placed on paying attention to the commune members' sleep and rest. In general, it must be ensured that commune members sleep for no less than six hours a day, and special personnel should be assigned to manage this work. Letting the masses rest well and have full energy can stimulate their minds, create inventions, and reform tools, thereby improving work efficiency and completing tasks.
    Fourth, do a good job in sanitation to ensure the health of commune members. Run kindergartens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly well so that both the old and the young are well-cared for.
    Fifth, carry out red flag competitions for canteens and welfare undertakings, organize various visits, and convene battlefield meetings. Party secretaries at all levels should cultivate experimental plots for public canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries, set an example, gain experience, and promote the work.

    管好集体生活  保证生产跃进
    新乡地委全面安排群众集体福利工作
    本报郑州10日电　为了进一步改进群众生活，推动工农业生产大跃进和巩固人民公社，中共南河新乡地委最近提出要让广大社员吃好、穿暖、睡好，老人有人管，幼儿有人教，使人人生活满意，个个精神舒畅。
    目前新乡地区已普遍实行了生活集体化。集体福利事业一般办得很好，但也存在不少问题。
    据此，中共新乡地委就进一步作好群众生活福利工作采取了相应的措施。首先，地委要求公社的各级党委和全体党员干部必须充分认识办好社会主义集体福利事业和发展生产的关系。做好生活福利工作，保证社员有强壮的身体，有高昂的精神和高度的劳动效率，正是为了进一步保证生产的更大跃进；因此群众的吃穿等生活问题已经和领导生产一样应放在各级领导的肩上。
    第二，办好公共食堂。保证大家吃饱吃好，要争取使每人每天能吃到三钱油、五钱盐、二斤鲜菜。作到饭食多样化、红芋面包点心化，一星期饭食不重样。食堂管理工作应认真贯彻阶级路线，对管理人员和炊事员再进行普遍审查，把坏分子都清洗出去。最近天气已逐渐寒冷，要求十天内全区所有食堂实现简易饭厅化，保证社员吃到热饭热菜。
    第三，特别强调要注意社员的睡眠与休息。一般必须保证社员每天睡觉的时间不少于六小时，并责成专人管理这项工作。让群众休息好，有饱满的精神，才能开动脑筋，创造发明，改革工具，从而提高工效，完成任务。
    第四，搞好卫生工作，保证社员身体健康。办好幼儿园、托儿所、幸福院等，使老少各得其所。
    第五、开展食堂和福利事业的红旗竞赛，组织各种参观，召开战地会议。各级党委书记要搞公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所等试验田，作出榜样，取得经验，推动工作。
