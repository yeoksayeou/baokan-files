Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 4th: Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" on November 1st published an article entitled "The Worries and Indignation of Hong Kong Pro-Chiang Newspapers," analyzing the reaction of these newspapers to the Chiang-Dulles talks communiqué, which evolved from embellishment to dissatisfaction, and finally to greater indignation.

"Ta Kung Pao's" report stated that the reaction of Hong Kong pro-Chiang newspapers can be divided into several stages, and the "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" serves as a clear example. This Kuomintang newspaper published the full text of the Chiang-Dulles talks communiqué on October 24th, with a headline emphasizing "Determination to Defend Kinmen and Matsu" and the "United Solidarity" between the US and Chiang. However, the editorial that day evaded the main issue, discussing the "Thai coup" at length.

The next day, October 25th, the newspaper's editorial expressed "concern" over the phrase "not relying on force." But it reassured itself by saying, "In some subtle way, it may be necessary. ... We don't need to overemphasize the superficial wording of the communiqué, let's wait and see the actual performance afterwards!"

"Ta Kung Pao" pointed out: However, "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" also knew that there was no need to "wait and see the actual performance afterwards." On the third day, October 26th, the pro-Chiang newspaper's editorial believed that the Chiang-Dulles talks communiqué had "three major disadvantages" for the Taiwan authorities, "comparable to eating a political 'atomic bomb'," which was "truly regrettable."

"Ta Kung Pao" said: By the fourth day, October 27th, the "Hong Kong Commercial Daily's" editorial opened fire on the United States, starting with a quote from Minister Peng Dehuai's second letter to Taiwan compatriots, calling for "turning enemies into friends." "Ta Kung Pao" stated that Dulles' visit to Taiwan had already created "an emotional scar" for the Taiwan authorities in their relationship with the United States. "If the US authorities do not wake up quickly, then Peng Dehuai's words mentioned above will easily take effect." The "Hong Kong Commercial Daily's" editorial also believed that the United States wanted "to neutralize Taiwan, making it a US base in the Western Pacific, while using the Republic of China's (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) officials and soldiers as US-hired garrison troops." It also believed that "the United States wants to treat Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek group) officials and soldiers as loyal servants, placing them in a 'life imprisonment' prison while acting as the prison warden." As for the Chiang-Dulles talks communiqué, it was entirely "according to the American's wishes." This pro-Chiang newspaper believed that these oppressive acts of the United States against the Taiwan authorities "do not need to wait for the CCP to instigate, the US authorities are already instigating themselves."

"Ta Kung Pao" wrote: By the fifth day, October 28th, the "Hong Kong Commercial Daily's" editorial proposed that Chiang Kai-shek convene a "National Salvation Conference" to "soothe the wounds of the people's hearts" and to show that "the constraints that the United States wants us to accept fundamentally violate the will of all our people (referring to the Chiang group members)," and to express that "we still fully retain the freedom of counter-offensive actions." The "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" believed that only in this way could the Taiwan authorities "cut a bloody path out of the thorns!"

    香港亲蒋报纸对蒋杜公报反应
    满腹牢骚忍不住  一股怨气出腔来
    香港“大公报”评论一针见血
    从粉饰到不满到愤慨
    第一天　顾左右而言他
    第二天　表示有点担心
    第三天　认为三大不利
    第四天　怨责美国欺压
    第五天　主张杀出血路
    新华社香港4日电　香港“大公报”1日以“香港亲蒋报纸的担心与愤懑”为题，分析了这些报纸对蒋杜会谈公报的反应，是从粉饰到不满，到更大的愤慨。
      “大公报”的这篇报道说，香港亲蒋报纸的反应可分成几个阶段，以“工商日报”为例，可以看得很清楚。这家国民党报纸在10月24日刊登蒋杜会谈公报的全文，标题还强调什么“决心保卫金马”和美蒋“团结一致”。可是，当天的社论却顾左右而言他，大谈其“泰国政变”。
    第二天，10月25日，这家报纸的社论却对“非凭借武力”这一句表示“担心”了。但又自我安慰地说，“在某种微妙作用上，也许不得不尔。……我们不必过于看重公报上表面的文章，还是等看此后的实际表现吧！”
    “大公报”指出：可是，“工商日报”也知道实在不必“等看此后的实际表现”了，第三天，10月26日，这家亲蒋报纸的社论认为，蒋杜会谈公报对台湾当局有“三大不利”，“可以比于吃了一颗政治‘原子弹’”，“真堪惋惜”。
    “大公报”说：到了第四天，10月27日，“工商日报”的社论就对美国开炮了，一开头就引用了彭德怀部长再告台湾同胞书中“化敌为友”的号召。“大公报”说，杜勒斯这次到台湾已经划了台湾当局对美国的“一条感情上的伤痕，如果美国当局不赶快觉悟，则彭德怀上述的话，是不难发生作用的”。“工商日报”的社论还认为，美国要“把台湾中立化起来，成为美国在西太平洋的基地，而以中华民国（指蒋介石集团）的官员士兵作为美国雇佣的戍卒。”并认为“美国要把中国（蒋介石集团）官员士兵作忠仆，安置在一个‘无期徒刑’的监狱里而自为监狱官。”至于蒋杜会谈公报，更是“一任美国人的尊意”。这家亲蒋报纸认为，美国对台湾当局的这些欺压行为，“不必等待中共挑拨，美国当局已在自行挑拨了。”“大公报”写道：到了第五天，10月28日，“工商日报”的社论提出了要蒋介石召开“救国会议”的主张，以便“抚慰人心的创伤”和表明“美国要我接纳的束缚，乃根本违背我全体人民（指蒋集团分子）的意愿”，并且要表示“仍充分保留反攻行动的自由”。“工商日报”认为，台湾当局只有这样才能“从荆棘丛中杀出一条血路来！”
