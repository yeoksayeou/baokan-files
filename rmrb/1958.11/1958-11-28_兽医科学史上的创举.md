    A Pioneering Innovation in the History of Veterinary Science

    After breaking with the theory of conditions and casting aside feelings of inferiority, He Zaiyang and Chen Guipan, technical cadres at the Veterinary Diagnosis Room of the Wanxian Special District of Sichuan, and technician Zhou Shifu, through more than three months of diligent research, successfully experimented with "goat-modified rabbit-modified hog cholera attenuated vaccine" and "hog-modified first-generation rabbit-modified hog cholera attenuated vaccine."

    After the Wanxian District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed that hog cholera be eliminated throughout the district within two years, the production of the hog cholera prevention vaccine—rabbit toxin—was widely launched in various places. The entire district has more than three million pigs, and the production of preventive vaccines requires more than 50,000 rabbits; however, the entire district currently only has 20,000 rabbits, of which only more than 6,800 can be used to produce vaccines. Therefore, the District Committee instructed the Special District Veterinary Diagnosis Room to use other livestock to replace rabbits in the trial production of vaccines. After repeated research and review of relevant reference materials, He Zaiyang and Chen Guipan of the Diagnosis Room were inspired by the principle of using rabbit toxin to make cattle plague vaccine. They decided to use this method to inject rabbit toxin into goats in the same way, and then through several generations, allow the rabbit toxin to fully adapt in the goats, increase its susceptibility, and produce hog cholera vaccine. In Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Wanxian City, more than 100 pigs were injected with goat toxin at three different dilutions. Two weeks later, two pigs were selected from each of these three groups, and two control pigs were selected separately. The strongest Shimen strain of hog cholera virulent virus was used to determine the protective power. As a result, the two control pigs that were not injected with goat toxin died, and the six pigs injected with goat toxin were safe and sound. At the same time, they conducted experiments on hog-modified first-generation rabbit-modified hog cholera attenuated vaccine, and also achieved success.

    The success of these two experiments not only solved the difficulty of lacking rabbits for vaccine production, but also reduced costs.

    兽医科学史上的创举
    四川万县专区兽医诊断室技术干部何载阳、陈桂攀和技工周世富在打破条件论，砍掉自卑感以后，经过三个多月的刻苦钻研，试验成功了“山羊化兔化猪瘟弱毒疫苗”和“猪化一代兔化猪瘟弱毒疫苗”。
    中共万县地委提出全区在两年内消灭猪瘟的要求后，各地就普遍展开了猪瘟预防疫苗——兔毒的制造。全区有三百多万头生猪，制预防疫苗需要家兔五万多只；但目前全区仅有二万只，其中能制苗的只有六千八百多只。因此，地委即指示专区兽医诊断室用其他家畜代替家兔试制疫苗。诊断室何载阳、陈桂攀等经过反复研究，翻阅有关参考资料，从用兔毒制造牛瘟疫苗的原理中受到启发，决定用这个方法，把兔毒同样注射到山羊体内，再通过若干代，使兔毒在山羊体内充分适应，增加其感受性，制成猪瘟疫苗。在万县市郊区红光农业社，用山羊毒以三种不同的稀释度分别注射了一百多头猪。两周后，将这三种注射猪各选二头，另选对照猪二头，以最强的石门系猪瘟强毒作保护力测定，结果，未注射山羊毒的二头对照猪死去，注射过山羊毒的六头猪安然无恙。同时，他们进行了猪化一代兔化猪瘟弱毒疫苗的试验，也获得成功。
    这两项试验的成功，不仅解决了制疫苗缺家兔的困难，还降低了成本。
