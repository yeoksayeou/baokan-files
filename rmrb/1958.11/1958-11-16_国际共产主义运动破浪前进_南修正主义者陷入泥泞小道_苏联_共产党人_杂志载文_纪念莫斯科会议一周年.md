    The "Kommunist" magazine of the Soviet Union recently published an article by Ponomarev entitled "A New Stage in the International Communist Movement," commemorating the first anniversary of the Moscow Declaration of the Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties. The article elaborates in detail the tremendous development of the international communist movement over the past year, in the context of the socialist camp becoming stronger, the imperialist camp declining, and the struggle against revisionism and other opportunistic currents.

    The article states that countries in the socialist camp are developing vigorously toward socialism-communism at high speed, while the imperialist world is declining, corrupting, and falling into a serious economic crisis, with internal contradictions becoming increasingly acute. For example, comparing the first half of this year with the first half of last year, socialist countries increased pig iron production by 9%, steel by 10%, coal by 11%, and oil by 15%; while during the same period, capitalist countries reduced pig iron production by 19.6%, steel by 19.5%, coal by 9.1%, and oil by 1.8%. Currently, socialist countries are developing their national economies at high speed, confidently striving to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in a relatively short period of time. These great achievements are being made under the unprecedented unity and further mutual assistance and cooperation in economy and culture among socialist countries. The Moscow Declaration is playing a huge role in this regard.

    The article points out that the contradictions between capitalist countries and their colonies have deepened. In recent years, the torrent of national independence and liberation movements has been irresistibly impacting the Arab East and rapidly spreading to Africa and Latin America. The victory of the Iraqi revolution severely struck imperialism, destroyed the Baghdad aggressive bloc, and promoted the movement of the Arab people for national independence. The article states: "The existence of a strong and developing socialist camp and the development of anti-colonial national independence movements supported by socialist forces are rapidly disintegrating the colonial rule base of imperialism."

    The article continues by saying that imperialism is trying to implement a policy of strength and brinkmanship of war, frantically launching adventurous wars, aggressive provocations, in order to get rid of the crisis, but the result is running into snags everywhere. The article also said that the Peace Declaration reflects the aspirations of the broad masses of people to strive for peace. Over the past year, it has penetrated people's hearts and united all peace-loving forces in the world to actively fight for the cause of peace.

    The article says that the international communist movement, armed with the ideas of the Moscow Conference, has been further consolidated and developed. The most important characteristics of the past year are: the remarkable achievements of socialist construction in socialist countries, the consolidation of internationalist unity, the improvement of ideological and organizational work, and the expansion and increase of prestige of many communist parties in capitalist countries.

    Communist and Workers' Parties are growing and being tempered in the struggle against revisionism and other opportunistic currents. It is now particularly clear that the Moscow Conference's judgment that revisionism is the main danger in the communist movement and its pointing out that fraternal parties are resolutely fighting against this danger is completely correct. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia refused to participate in the declaration of the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries. Not only that, but the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia also put forward their own revisionist anti-Leninist program to counter the Marxist-Leninist Moscow Declaration. This program is a new Bernsteinism, that is, a program of right-wing opportunism. The aim of the revisionist program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is to split the unity of the socialist camp and the communist movement, slander socialism, abandon proletarian internationalism, and replace Marxism-Leninism with the revisionism of right-wing socialist ideology, defame and slander the communist parties of capitalist countries. The international communist movement unanimously opposed the Yugoslav revisionists and has isolated them. The development process of events after the publication of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia program powerfully revealed its enormous harm to the cause of peace, democracy and socialism, and showed its anti-Marxist powerlessness. Facts have proved that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have embarked on the muddy path of national communism, and are increasingly deeply mired in the quagmire of opportunism, and are moving farther and farther away from socialist ideology. The line of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has nothing in common with proletarian internationalism.

    The article points out that the struggle against revisionism is still continuing. This struggle has been strengthened in some parties. The Communist Party of Denmark waged a fierce struggle against the Larsen revisionist group. Larsen and his group have been completely bankrupt, and the Communist Party of the Netherlands recently crushed an opportunistic group. Conducting an irreconcilable struggle against revisionism and other opportunistic currents is the sacred task of Marxist-Leninists.

    The article emphasizes that the communist movement will inevitably encounter difficulties on its path, and it will be attacked and persecuted by reactionary forces. The greater the achievements of the communist movement, the more brutal the enemies of the working class, and the more rampant their struggle against communism. This requires all honest representatives of the workers', democratic, and anti-war movements to pay close attention and mobilize forces to fight against imperialist aggressors and reactionaries. The reactionaries' offensive not only proves the aggressiveness of the imperialist monopoly groups, but also proves their weakness and their inability to rule in the old way.

    The article concludes by saying that the achievements of the socialist camp, the developing national liberation movement, and the increased organization and unity of the working class are further weakening the capitalist position. This means that it is much easier to repulse the reactionaries' offensive now than it was in 1933-1935. However, this can only be achieved through the concerted action of the working class and the masses, and first and foremost, by ensuring the unity of the working class.

    国际共产主义运动破浪前进  南修正主义者陷入泥泞小道
    苏联“共产党人”杂志载文
    纪念莫斯科会议一周年
    新华社莫斯科14日电　最近出版的“共产党人”杂志发表了波诺马烈夫的一篇题为“国际共产主义运动新阶段”的文章，纪念共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议宣言一周年。文章详细论述了一年来在社会主义阵营更加强大、帝国主义阵营日趋没落的形势下，在反对修正主义和其他机会主义流派的斗争中，国际共产主义运动所获得的巨大发展。
    文章说，社会主义阵营各国正在以高速度朝着社会主义—共产主义蓬勃发展，而帝国主义世界日趋没落、腐败，陷入严重的经济危机，内部各种矛盾日益尖锐化。如以今年上半年与去年上半年相比，社会主义国家生铁增产了9％，钢增产10％，煤增产11％，石油增产15％；而同一时期，资本主义各国生铁减产19.6％，钢减产19.5％，煤减产9.1％，石油减产1.8％。目前，社会主义国家正在高速度发展着国民经济，信心百倍地争取在较短时间内赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。这些巨大成就正是在社会主义国家间的空前团结、经济文化的进一步互助合作之下取得的。而在这方面莫斯科宣言正起着巨大的作用。
    文章指出，资本主义国家和它们的殖民地之间的矛盾加深了。近年来，民族独立解放运动的洪流正以无可阻挡之势冲击着阿拉伯东方，迅速扩展到非洲、拉丁美洲。伊拉克革命的胜利严重地打击了帝国主义，摧毁了巴格达侵略集团，推动了阿拉伯人民争取民族独立运动。文章说：“强大的、日益发展的社会主义阵营的存在和受到社会主义力量支持的反殖民主义民族独立运动的发展，迅速地瓦解着帝国主义的殖民统治基础。”
    文章接着说，帝国主义力图推行实力政策和战争边缘政策，猖狂地发动冒险战争、侵略挑衅，来摆脱危机困境，但结果是到处碰壁。文章又说，和平宣言反映了广大人民的争取和平的愿望。一年来它深入人心，团结全世界一切爱好和平力量积极为和平事业而斗争。
    文章说，被莫斯科会议的思想武装起来的国际共产主义运动，已更加巩固和发展了。一年来最主要的特征是：社会主义阵营各国社会主义建设的卓越的成就，国际主义团结的巩固，思想和组织工作水平的提高，资本主义国家许多共产党队伍的扩大和威信的增长。
    共产党和工人党正在反修正主义和其他机会主义流派的斗争中成长和锻炼着。现在特别明显地可以看出，莫斯科会议判定修正主义是共产主义运动中主要的危险，指出兄弟党为反对这一危险而进行坚决斗争，是作得十分正确的。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟拒绝参加社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言。不但如此，南共领导还提出了自己修正主义的反列宁主义的纲领，来和马克思列宁主义的莫斯科宣言相对抗。这个纲领是新伯恩斯坦主义、也就是右倾机会主义的纲领。南共修正主义纲领的目的是要分裂社会主义阵营与共产主义运动的团结，诽谤社会主义，放弃无产阶级国际主义，而以右派社会主义思想的修正主义来偷换马克思列宁主义，污蔑和诽谤资本主义各国的共产党。国际共产主义运动一致反对了南斯拉夫修正主义者，并且已使他们孤立起来。南共纲领公布以后的事件发展进程，有力地揭露了它对和平、民主和社会主义事业的巨大危害性，并且表明了它反马克思主义的无能为力。事实证明，南共领导已走入了民族共产主义的泥泞小道，并越来越深地陷入机会主义的泥坑，越来越远地离开社会主义思想。南共的路线和无产阶级国际主义毫无共同之处。
    文章指出，反修正主义的斗争还在继续中。在某些党内这一斗争已经加强了。丹麦共产党为反对拉森修正主义集团进行了剧烈的斗争，拉森和他的集团已遭到彻底破产，不久前荷兰共产党粉碎了机会主义集团。对修正主义和其他机会主义流派进行不调和斗争是马克思列宁主义者神圣的任务。
    文章强调说，共产主义运动在自己的道路上不可免地要遇到困难，它会遭到反动势力的攻击和迫害。共产主义运动的成绩越大，工人阶级敌人就越残暴，他们反对共产主义的斗争也就越猖狂。这就要求所有工人、民主、反战运动的正直代表密切注意，要求动员力量去为反对帝国主义侵略者和反动派进行斗争。反动派的进攻不但证明帝国主义垄断集团的侵略性，而且还证明了它们的软弱性，它们没有能力再以旧方法来进行统治了。
    文章最后说，社会主义阵营的成就，正在发展着的民族解放运动和工人阶级组织性和团结的增强，更加削弱了资本主义阵地。这意味着目前打退反动派的进攻，要比1933—1935年容易得多。但是，这只有靠工人阶级和人民群众一致行动才能实现，首先是要工人阶级的团结来保证。
