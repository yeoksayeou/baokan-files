    Indigenous and Foreign Methods Combined for Comprehensive Utilization of Coal
    A Simple Square Dry Distillation Furnace Built in Lushun-Dalian
    (Our dispatch) A red banner for the comprehensive utilization of coal using indigenous and foreign methods has been erected in Lushun-Dalian. The Institute of Petroleum of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Coal Research Office, among other departments, have jointly created a simple square dry distillation furnace and by-product recovery device. Since the beginning of September, it has been continuously using ordinary fuel coal to produce coke, coal tar, gas, electricity, diesel, phenol, paraffin, and other products, finding a shortcut with quick results, great achievements, small investment, and easy operation for expanding the comprehensive utilization of coal.
    This square dry distillation furnace utilizes the production principles of a modern square dry distillation furnace used in the oil refining industry. At the same time, it absorbs some of the advantages of indigenous furnaces, such as the "heap dry distillation furnace," in terms of furnace structure, materials, and technical operations, making the cost of building the furnace similar to that of an indigenous furnace, while greatly improving production efficiency. In terms of the comprehensive utilization of coal, it has the following outstanding characteristics and advantages: (1) It obtains coke, coal tar, gas, electricity, and various chemical industrial raw materials through a relatively simple production process; (2) It can continuously add materials and continuously discharge coke, resulting in high production efficiency and good working conditions. Its dry distillation time is eight to ten hours; (3) It can flexibly adjust products according to needs. For example, if more medium-temperature coke is needed, the furnace temperature can be appropriately increased; (4) It can use weakly caking or non-caking lump coal to refine metallurgical coke for indigenous blast furnaces; (5) The structure is more complex and there is more equipment, but the technical operation is simpler, more convenient, and easier to control; (6) It has a long service life. With careful maintenance, it will not collapse and shut down for several years; (7) It is tightly sealed and has strong safety. The simple square dry distillation furnace and its by-product recovery device have very high productivity. It is operated by fifteen workers in three rotating shifts, and can process twelve tons of raw coal per day and night. Based on three hundred and thirty working days per year, it can process three thousand nine hundred and sixty tons of lump coal, producing two thousand one hundred and twenty tons of coke (including eight hundred and forty-seven tons of coke powder), five hundred and fifty tons of coal tar, and three hundred and eight billion eight hundred million cubic meters of gas. If all the coke is supplied to small blast furnaces, it can refine about one thousand five hundred tons of gray cast iron annually; after simple processing of each ton of coal tar by a simple recovery device, it can already obtain twenty-five to one hundred kilograms of gasoline, three hundred and forty-five kilograms of light diesel, one hundred and ten kilograms of phenols (which can be used as raw materials for making plastics, nylon, and medicine), four hundred and forty-seven kilograms of soft asphalt, and four kilograms of paraffin. With the addition of some simple equipment, it can also recover sulfur ammonia fertilizer and benzene and other chemical raw materials. In addition, the gas generated during the dry distillation process can generate 0.31 degrees of electricity per cubic meter when driving a gas engine. The gas generated by the square furnace during the dry distillation process, in addition to self-use, can drive a 200-kilowatt generator, which can generate more than 1.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, enough for a 50,000-spindle textile factory for one and a half months.

    土洋结合综合利用煤炭
    一座简易方型干馏炉在旅大建成
    本报讯　用土洋结合办法综合利用煤炭的一面红旗，在旅大市树立起来了。中国科学院石油研究所和煤炭研究室等部门共同创建了一座简易方型干馏炉和副产品回收装置，从9月初到现在不间断地用普通燃料煤生产出焦炭、焦油、煤气、电力、柴油、酚、石腊等产品，为扩大煤的综合利用找到了一条收效快、成果大、投资少，操作易的捷径。
    这座方型干馏炉运用了近代化炼油工业中的一种方形干馏炉的生产原理，同时，在炉子结构、取材和技术操作等方面吸收了土炉子“成堆干馏炉”的一些优点，使建炉成本和土炉子差不多，生产效率却大大提高。在综合利用煤的效果方面，有如下突出的特点和优越性：（1）通过较简单的生产过程，获取了焦炭、焦油、煤气、电和多种化学工业原料；（2）它能连续加料，连续出焦，生产效率高，劳动条件好，它的干馏时间是八至十小时；（3）能根据需要灵活地调整产品；如需要多出中温焦，可适当提高炉温；（4）能够采用弱粘结或不粘结的块煤炼出土高炉用的冶金焦；（5）结构较复杂，设备较多，但技术操作上较简单方便，容易控制；（6）寿命长，加意检修，数年内不会倒塌停产；（7）密封甚严，保安性强。简易方型干馏炉和它的副产品回收装置的生产率很高，它由十五个工人轮流分三班操作，每昼夜可以处理原煤十二吨，全年三百三十个工作日计算，能处理块煤三千九百六十吨，可以生产出焦炭二千一百二十吨（其中包括焦粉八百四十七吨），焦油五百五十吨，煤气三百零八亿八千八百万立方公尺。把焦炭全部供给小高炉，每年可炼出一千五百吨左右的灰口生铁；每吨焦油经过简易的回收装置加工，已可得到汽油二十五至一百公斤，轻柴油三百四十五公斤，酚类（可作制塑料、尼隆、医药的原料）一百一十公斤，软沥青四百四十七公斤，石腊四公斤，再安一部分简单装置，还可回收硫氨肥料和苯类等化工原料。另外，干馏过程中发生的煤气，每立方公尺可推动煤气机发电零点三一度，方型炉在干馏过程中发生的煤气，除自用外，能推动二百瓩的发电机，每年能生产电一百七十多万度，够一个五万纱锭的纺织厂用一个半月。
