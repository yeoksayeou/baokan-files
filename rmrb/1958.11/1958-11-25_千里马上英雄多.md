    Many Heroes Ride the Chollima Horse
    Our Correspondent Wang Yuzhang
    Recently, the working people of Korea, responding to the call of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, have mounted the Chollima horse and launched a great upsurge in production. Workers in various factories have proposed to increase their output by double or several times next year compared to this year, and farmers want to produce 200 or even 400 tons of grain per chongbo (approximately 15 mu or 2.47 acres) in their experimental fields. Truly, everyone is riding the Chollima, and everyone is full of heroic spirit.

    Leader of the Korea-China Friendship Production Team
    Workers at the Pyongyang Rubber Factory, in this great production upsurge, were the first to propose that next year's labor productivity be increased three times and output increased four times compared to this year. They spearheaded this vigorous movement. Recently, I visited Zheng Shixia, an advanced worker at this factory. Zheng Shixia is the leader of the Korea-China Friendship Production Team in the flat belt workshop. In 1952, he went to the Tianjin Rubber Factory in China for a six-month internship, where he learned the technology for manufacturing flat belts. In October of this year – during the Korea-China Friendship Month – the factory workers wanted to select outstanding production teams from the entire factory as Korea-China Friendship Production Teams. As a result, Zheng Shixia's team was honorably named the Korea-China Friendship Production Team. During the Korea-China Friendship Month, their team overfulfilled the production plan by 40%.

    However, recently, Zheng Shixia and his comrades put their minds together and改造 (gaizao) the calendaring machine for压制 (yazhi) flat belts, changing it from being able to压制 (yazhi) only one layer of flat belt at a time to压制 (yazhi) two layers. In addition, they accelerated the speed of rotation, so that the daily output of flat belts in November reached nearly 5,000 square meters, increasing to 3.5 times that of October. This is not all; next year they will produce 1.85 million square meters of flat belts, supplying the needs of belt conveyors used in irrigation projects in various rural areas in large quantities. Compared with this year's output, this is a leap of more than eleven times.

    The Creator of the First Tractor
    The first tractor manufactured by Korean workers themselves was born on November 7 this year at the Giyang Agricultural Machinery Factory. Recently, I visited the creators of this tractor. One of the creators, 53-year-old veteran worker Kim Geum-san, told me: "Today, Koreans can make anything. If you asked me to build an airplane, I could do it!" This is the bold voice of the Korean working class today.

    It would have been unimaginable to manufacture a tractor in this factory, which lacked heavy equipment and previously only manufactured machines such as corn threshers, and was not large in scale. Therefore, when Kang Jong-gyeong, the director of the trial production workshop, and the workers wanted to trial-produce a tractor, even some technicians at the factory did not believe it could be done successfully.

    But Kang Jong-gyeong did not lose heart. He disassembled the most difficult-to-manufacture parts and consulted with veteran workers Kim Sun-gil, Kim Geum-san, Kim Chang-mok, and others to discuss whether they could be manufactured. Kim Sun-gil and others all said they could. Later, they were encouraged and supported by Premier Kim Il-sung, which boosted their confidence even more. They had already started trial production at the end of August this year, proposing to complete it by November 7.

    How could these workers, who had never even touched a tractor, manufacture one? But they had endless drive and inquisitiveness. They did not have design drawings, so they disassembled a tractor and drew the parts and components according to the appearance of each part. Veteran worker Kim Geum-san, who manufactured the carburetor, the most complex and difficult part to manufacture in the tractor engine, failed three times in a row, but he finally succeeded. Kim Sun-gil and Kim Chang-mok forged forgings that could not be forged in the factory by hand. During the most intense days, Kang Jong-gyeong, Kim Geum-san, and 44 other workers did not go home for a month and a half. They were united like one person to create the tractor, eating and sleeping together in the workshop, working day and night. They also adopted new technologies such as nodular cast iron in the trial production process.

    In this way, the first "Chollima" tractor in Korean history, manufactured by Korean workers, with 28 horsepower, was created. Not only that, but the workers at the Giyang Agricultural Machinery Factory are now actively preparing to manufacture some of the necessary machinery and equipment themselves, striving to produce 3,500 such tractors by next year to supply the needs of the rural areas.

    The creation of the tractor sent a signal for creating even greater miracles on the industrial front. Following this, the Tokchon Automobile Repair Factory in Korea created Korea's first truck, and the Pyongyang Daily Necessities Factory created a motorcycle. All of this marks that Korean industry has leaped to a new height.

    Heroes Building the Yunfeng Power Plant
    I met Korean labor hero Zhu Youxian at the construction site of the Yunfeng Power Plant, a joint China-Korea project with a generating capacity of 600,000 kilowatts. In mid-November, there were already ice floes in the Yalu River, and the cold wind was biting. Zhu Youxian is a carpenter, and he was building workers' dormitories with the workers on the south bank of the Yalu River. In order to complete the preparations for the construction project as soon as possible, they are determined to build 24 collective dormitories (each accommodating 60 people) before November 24, regardless of the cold weather, so that the workers can move in first. Other workers are installing excavators, and some are working on the water-blocking project for the power plant dam. The construction site is very active. The workers are determined to make all preparations before May next year and complete the construction of the dam undertaken by Korea ahead of schedule, before September 1961, one year earlier.

    Zhu Youxian is a carpenter responsible for manufacturing the models used to pour the concrete dam. He won the title of labor hero in the restoration and expansion project of the Supung Dam. Now, because the dam project has not yet started, he first participated in the construction of housing. By April next year, they will also build 4,000 houses and public buildings such as shops, schools, and hospitals, turning Yunfeng-ri, which now has only 150 farming households, into a city of builders.

    Zhu Youxian told reporters: "I am very happy to build this hydroelectric power plant with the Chinese worker brothers. During the war, the Chinese People's Volunteers fought alongside us, exposing the American paper tiger. Now we are building a hydroelectric power station with the Chinese people, which will further develop the Korea-China friendship cemented with blood." (Attached picture)

    千里马上英雄多
    本报记者　王玉章
    最近朝鲜劳动人民响应朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相的号召，跨上千里马，掀起了一个大增产高潮。各工厂的工人们提出要使明年的产量比今年增加一倍或数倍，农民们要在每町步（每町步约合十五市亩）试验田里生产二百吨甚至四百吨粮食。真正是人人骑上千里马，个个都是英雄劲。
    朝中友好生产小组组长
    平壤橡胶工厂的工人们，在这次大增产高潮中，首先发起要使明年的劳动生产率比今年提高三倍，产量提高四倍。他们在这个轰轰烈烈的运动中打了先锋。记者最近访问了这个工厂的先进工人郑世夏。郑世夏是平皮带车间的朝中友好生产小组的组长，1952年他曾经到中国天津橡胶厂实习了半年，在那里学习了制造平皮带的技术。今年10月——朝中友好月中，厂内工人们要推选全厂优秀的生产小组作为朝中友好生产小组，结果郑世夏的小组被光荣地命名为朝中友好生产小组。在朝中友好月里，他们小组超额40％完成了生产计划。
    但是最近，郑世夏同他的同伴们一起，开动脑筋，把压制平皮带的梳化机进行了改造，使它由一次只能压一层平皮带变为压二层，另外加快了转动的速度，使11月份的平皮带日产量达到近五千平方，将增加到10月份的三点五倍。这还不算多，明年他们要生产一百八十五万平方平皮带，大量供应各地农村兴修灌溉工程所用的皮带运输机的需要。同今年的产量相比，跃增到十一倍多。
    第一辆拖拉机的制造者
    朝鲜工人自己制造的第一辆拖拉机，今年11月7日在岐阳农业机械厂诞生了。记者最近访问了这辆拖拉机的制造者。制造者之一，五十三岁的老工人金锦山对记者说：“今天的朝鲜人什么都能造，要我造飞机也办得到！”这就是今天朝鲜工人阶级豪迈的声音。
    要在这个缺少重型设备、过去只造玉米脱粒机等机械的设备规模不大的工厂中制造拖拉机，本来是难以想像的事。所以，当试制车间主任康宗敬和工人们要试制拖拉机时，连本厂的有些技术人员也不相信能够成功。
    但是康宗敬没有灰心，他拆下最难制造的零件找老工人金顺吉、金锦山、金昌木等研究，同他们商量能不能制造，金顺吉等都说能够制造。后来他们又受到了金日成首相的鼓励和支持，更加信心百倍。他们已在今年8月底开始试制，提出要在11月7日制成。
    这些对拖拉机摸也没有摸过的工人们，怎么能够制造拖拉机呢？但他们有的是无穷的干劲和钻劲。他们没有设计图，就把一辆拖拉机拆开照各个部件零件样子画成图。老工人金锦山制造拖拉机引擎中最复杂最难造的气化器，一连失败了三次，但他最后成功了。金顺吉和金昌木用手工锻成了厂内不能锻的锻件。在最紧张的日子里，康宗敬、金锦山等四十四个工人一个半月没有回家，他们为了造成拖拉机团结得像一个人一样，在车间里一块吃一块睡，日夜苦战，在试制过程中还采用了球墨铸铁等新式的技术。
    就这样，朝鲜历史上第一辆由朝鲜工人制造的有二十八马力的“千里马”号拖拉机造成了。不仅如此，岐阳农业机械厂的工人们现在正在积极准备自己制造一些必须的机器设备，争取到明年生产三千五百台这样的拖拉机，以供应农村的需要。
    拖拉机的造成，为工业战线上创造更大的奇迹发出了一个信号。接着，朝鲜德川汽车修配厂造成了朝鲜的第一辆载重汽车，平壤日用品工厂造成了摩托车。这一切，标志着朝鲜的工业已跃入了一个新的高度。

    建设云峰发电厂的英雄
    记者在中朝合建的发电容量六十万瓩的云峰发电厂的建设工地上，遇见了朝鲜劳动英雄朱尤先。11月中旬，鸭绿江里已经飘着浮冰，寒风吹来，冷气逼人。朱尤先是木工，他正在鸭绿江南岸同工人们一起修建工人宿舍。为了早日完成建设工程的准备工作，他们决心不顾天寒地冻，要在11月24日以前建成二十四幢集体宿舍（每幢能容六十人），让工人们先住下来。另外的工人们有的在安装挖土机，有的在搞发电厂大坝拦水工程，工地上十分活跃。工人们决心在明年5月以前作好一切准备工作，提前一年在1961年9月以前完成朝鲜分工担负的大坝的修建工程。
    朱尤先是负责制造浇灌混凝土大坝所用的模型的木工，他在水丰发电站的恢复扩建工程中获得了劳动英雄称号，现在因为大坝工程还没有开始，他就先参加了建设住宅的工作，到明年4月以前，他们还要盖起四千户住宅以及商店、学校、医院等公共建筑物，把这个现在只有一百五十户农民的云峰里变成一个建设者的城市。
    朱尤先对记者说：同中国工人兄弟们一同来建设这个水电厂，使我感到非常高兴。在战争时期，中国人民志愿军同我们并肩作战，戳穿了美国纸老虎，现在我们又同中国人民一同来建设水电站，这将使以鲜血凝成的朝中友谊进一步发展。（附图片）
