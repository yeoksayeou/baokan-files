Observe the Soil and Fertilize: Increase Production a Hundredfold
Southern County Launches Soil Survey Movement to Maximize the Effectiveness of Various Measures

(Our Correspondent Yu Jingqi Reports) Southern County, Sichuan Province, is vigorously carrying out a mass soil survey and appraisal movement in conjunction with deep plowing, in order to effectively improve the soil, better implement rational fertilization and close planting, and create conditions for a greater leap forward next year.

Since early September, more than 1,000 soil survey and appraisal team members, with farmer technicians as the backbone, have been dispatched. They are working day and night to investigate and study the soil conditions throughout the county, preparing to formulate a county-wide soil improvement plan. At the same time, they are conducting block-by-block appraisals of the soil in all small spring high-yield experimental fields, drawing up rational fertilization plans. The county expects to complete this task in two months.

Southern County is one of the counties in Sichuan with relatively rapid agricultural production leaps this year. The county's small spring crops, early rice, and middle rice have all increased significantly in production, and it has become the first county in the hilly area of northern Sichuan to achieve 1,000 jin per mu for middle rice. An important reason for the rapid leap forward is that the people of the county have vigorously promoted many advanced measures such as deep plowing, close planting, and increased application of fertilizers, and have processed the land, especially increasing the amount of fertilizer. However, a problem has also emerged in production: many experimental fields with large amounts of fertilizer and intensive cultivation have not achieved high yields, and crops in many soils have lodged extensively, or have not achieved the expected yield increase. As a result, some cadres and masses are both happy and afraid of fertilizer, and doubt the effectiveness of soil improvement.

The Southern County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the main reason for this problem is that in the past there was a lack of research on land and fertilizer issues, and a lack of sufficient knowledge and methods for rational fertilization according to the needs of the land and crops. This problem also directly affects how to better implement advanced measures such as deep plowing and close planting. Therefore, the county committee decided to rely on the masses to carry out county-wide soil appraisal work. With the help of scientific institutions, the county has held three training courses since July, training more than 400 farmer technicians. Immediately, with them as the backbone, and absorbing old farmers, commune cadres, and primary and secondary school teachers, a soil survey and appraisal army of more than 1,000 people was quickly formed. Currently, it has been expanded into a mass survey team of more than 10,000 people, with each production brigade having a survey team of four or five technically proficient people.

Farmer technicians trained in Southern County generally master three skills: (1) They can measure various nutrients in the soil; (2) They can identify the soil's parent material, type, distribution, and characteristics, and can draw soil distribution and improvement maps; (3) They can propose soil improvement methods and fertilization requirements for different crops and different growth periods. Now more than 80% of people can work independently.

After more than a month of mass surveys, the characteristics of the county's representative soils have been grasped. The most abundant soil in the county is purple soil. This is a neutral soil, rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The amount of fertilizer and the proportion of various fertilizers can be determined according to the degree of deep plowing, different crops, and different growth periods of the crops. The second type is yellow soil, which is a highly acidic soil. When transforming it, alkaline substances need to be added. In addition to deep plowing, attention should be paid to applying fertilizers rich in phosphorus and potassium when fertilizing this type of soil. The third type is red soil, which is of poor quality, but it does not account for a large proportion. After chemical analysis of these representative soils, people have a bottom line understanding of the soil conditions throughout the county. A survey and appraisal was also conducted on the soil of tens of thousands of mu of wheat and rape experimental fields throughout the county, and fertilization plans were determined according to the soil characteristics of each mu of cultivated land, making fertilization scientifically based and not blind. At the same time, through this mass soil survey work, the soil appraisal survey team has also been strengthened, from professional and technical personnel to the broad masses.

Soil survey and appraisal work has already played an important role in agricultural production. Many communes' middle rice and cotton production have increased due to changes in the original management measures through soil appraisal. At the same time, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses throughout the county is high, and they plan to thicken tens of thousands of mu of poor soil, and 200,000 mu of cultivated land will participate in the competition for 10,000 jin of grain per mu of small spring crops.

    看土施肥　增产百倍
    南部县开展土壤普查运动，让各种措施发挥更大作用
    本报讯　记者于竞祁报道：四川省南部县结合深翻地大力开展群众性的土壤普查鉴定运动，以便有效地改良土壤，更好地合理施肥和密植，为明年更大的跃进创造条件。
    9月上旬以来，全县以农民技术员为骨干的一千多土壤普查鉴定队员已全部出动。他们夜以继日地调查和研究全县土壤情况，准备制订全县土壤改良规划，同时对所有小春高产试验田的土壤进行逐块鉴定，订出合理施肥规划。全县预计两个月就可以完成这项任务。
    南部县是四川今年农业生产跃进较快的一个县。全县小春作物、早稻、中稻增产都很大，并成为川北丘陵区的第一个中稻千斤县。跃进快的重要原因是全县人民大力地推行了深耕、密植、增施肥料等许多先进措施和对土地进行了加工，其中特别是肥料增加很多。但在生产中也出现了一个问题：不少大量施肥加意培植的试验田产量反而不高，许多土壤良好的田地作物大量倒伏，或并未达到预期增产效果。因而使部分干部和群众对肥料又喜又怕，对改良土壤的效果发生怀疑。
    中共南部县委认为，产生这一问题的主要原因，是由于过去对土地和肥料问题缺乏研究，对按土地、按作物需要合理施肥缺乏足够知识和办法。这个问题还直接影响到深耕、密植等先进措施如何更好地贯彻。因此，县委决定依靠群众，开展全县土壤鉴定工作。在科学机关的帮助下，全县从7月份开始，先后已办了三期训练班，训练了四百多名农民技术员。随即以他们为骨干，吸收老农民、社干部和中小学教师参加，迅速组成了一千多人的土地普查鉴定大军。目前，已经扩大成一万多人的群众普查队，每个生产大队都有由四五名懂技术的群众组成的普查小组。
    南部县经过训练的农民技术员一般地都掌握了三门技术：（1）能测出土壤中各种养分；（2）能识别土壤的母质、种类、分布、性状，能画出土壤分布及改良图；（3）能提出土壤改良办法和不同作物不同生长期的施肥要求。现在有80％以上的人都能独立工作。
    经过一个多月群众性的普查之后，已经掌握了全县代表性土壤的特点。全县最多的是紫色土壤。这是一种属于中性的土壤，含氮、磷、钾都丰富。这种土壤可根据深耕程度，按不同作物，以及作物不同的生长期，确定施肥量和各类肥的比例。第二类是黄色土壤，这是一种酸性较大的土壤。改造时，需加碱性物。对这类土壤除深耕外，施肥时要多注意施用含磷钾多的肥料。第三类是红色土壤，土质不好，但它占比率不大。经过对这些代表性的土壤的化学分析，使人对全县土壤的情况有了底。对全县十几万亩小麦和油菜试验田也都进行了普查和鉴定，根据每亩耕地的土壤特点，确定了施肥方案，使施肥有了科学根据，不盲目了。同时，经过这次群众性的，土壤普查工作，也壮大了土壤鉴定的普查队伍，由专业技术人员普及到广大群众。
    土壤普查鉴定工作，已经在农业生产上起了重要作用。许多公社的中稻和棉花由于通过土壤鉴定而改变了原来的管理措施，促进了增产。同时，全县干部群众情绪高涨，计划把十几万亩薄土加厚，有二十万亩耕地参加小春作物亩产万斤粮的竞赛。
