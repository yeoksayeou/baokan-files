Outstanding Activists of the German Workers' Movement: Liebknecht and Luxemburg

November 9th is the fortieth anniversary of the German November Revolution. Forty years ago, under the influence of the Russian October Socialist Revolution, the German working class heroically launched a revolutionary struggle against imperialism and militarism. Although this revolution failed due to the betrayal of opportunists in the workers' movement, it sowed the seeds of revolution. The Communist Party of Germany was born in the flames of the November Revolution. Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, leaders of the November Revolution and founders of the German Communist Party, will forever live in the hearts of the German working class and the working classes of all countries.

	Karl Liebknecht
	(1871—1919)

Liebknecht was the son of Wilhelm Liebknecht, a famous activist in the German democratic and workers' movements of the nineteenth century. A revolutionary working-class family molded him. From his youth, Karl Liebknecht was an active fighter in the German socialist movement. At that time, he paid close attention to carrying out revolutionary anti-militarist movements among young people. In 1907, at his initiative, the first international conference of socialist youth organizations was held in Germany. At this conference, Liebknecht made a report on the struggle against militarism. He pointed out that relentlessly and consistently carrying out the anti-militarist struggle would in itself lead to revolutionary maturity and the consolidation of the party, and that it was a living source of revolutionary spirit. The conference decided to establish the "International Union of Socialist Youth Organizations."

In 1912, Liebknecht was elected as a member of the German Reichstag. This was on the eve of the German militarists launching the First World War. In the Reichstag meetings, he angrily condemned the crimes of the arms monopoly organizations, led by the "Cannon King" Krupp, in inciting imperialist war. He said that the development of such arms industries was a threat to their own country. He constantly pointed out the dangers of militarism to the German people. At the Social Democratic Party Congress held in the same year, he called for consolidating the unity of the international proletariat as a powerful means of fighting militarism.

Like other German Social Democratic leftists, Liebknecht at the time failed to understand the relationship between imperialism and opportunism in the workers' movement, especially the danger of opportunist ideas within the working class. With Lenin's help, Liebknecht quickly corrected his mistakes.

During the First World War, in May 1915, Liebknecht pointed out to the German people: "The main enemy is at home," and this enemy was German imperialism. This statement was consistent with the spirit of the Russian Bolsheviks' slogan "Turn the imperialist war into a civil war." This courageous revolutionary action led to his arrest and a four-year sentence of hard labor. During his hard labor, he received news of the victory of the October Revolution. Liebknecht was not freed until October 1918.

After being released from prison, Liebknecht immediately started working intensively to create a social basis for a new, progressive Germany. He actively participated in and led the German November Revolution. However, the "German Republic" government, formed by utilizing the strength of revolutionary workers and soldiers, did not touch the foundations of imperialist and militarist forces, but instead gave the reactionaries an opportunity to raise their heads. With the help of right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party, the reactionaries implemented a conspiracy to strangle the revolution and to persecute revolutionary elements. On January 15, 1919, Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were arrested and killed by the German reactionary government.

	Rosa Luxemburg
	(1871—1919)

Rosa Luxemburg was born in Poland. After graduating from secondary school, she embarked on the revolutionary path and became one of the founders of the Social Democratic Party of Poland. In 1897, she moved to Germany. As one of the leaders of the Social Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania, she also actively participated in the work of the German Social Democratic Party and carried out the struggle against militarism.

In 1899, Luxemburg criticized Bernstein's revisionism and defended the doctrines of class struggle and the proletariat's need to seize power. However, her anti-opportunist struggle was incomplete, and she did not understand at the time that it was necessary to ideologically and organizationally draw a line between themselves and the opportunists.

During the First World War, Luxemburg firmly opposed the policies of the right-wing leaders of the German Social Democratic Party, and she devoted herself to uniting the left and opposing the imperialist war. She participated in the establishment of the German revolutionary organization "Spartacus League." Together with Liebknecht, she organized numerous mass revolutionary demonstrations during this period and was arrested and imprisoned many times.

Under the influence of the October Revolution, Luxemburg saw the importance of the role of the proletarian party and the alliance of workers and peasants from the experience of the Russian Bolsheviks, thus correcting her past mistakes. Under her and Liebknecht's leadership, the German left set about establishing the Communist Party.

Like Liebknecht, Luxemburg bravely led the revolutionary struggle against the German bourgeoisie and its lackeys, the right-wing Social Democrats, thus arousing the frenzied hatred of the counter-revolutionary forces. On January 15, 1919, after the failure of the workers' battle in Berlin, she and Liebknecht died together.

    德国工人运动的卓越活动家李卜克内西和卢森堡
    11月9日是德国十一月革命四十周年纪念日。四十年前，德国工人阶级在俄国十月社会主义革命的影响下，英勇地进行了一次反对帝国主义和军国主义的革命斗争。虽然这次革命由于工人运动中的机会主义者的出卖而失败了，但是播下了革命的种子。德国共产党就是在十一月革命烈火中诞生的。卡尔·李卜克内西和罗莎·卢森堡都是领导十一月革命和创建德国共产党的领袖，他们永远活在德国工人阶级和各国工人阶级的心里。
      卡尔·李卜克内西
      （1871—1919年）
    李卜克内西是德国十九世纪民主运动和工人运动著名活动家威廉·李卜克内西的儿子，革命的工人阶级和家庭陶冶了他。从青年时代起，卡尔·李卜克内西就是德国社会主义运动一名积极的战士。当时他非常注意在青年中进行反对军国主义的革命运动。1907年根据他的倡议，在德国举行了青年社会主义组织的第一次国际会议，在这次会议上，李卜克内西作了关于反对军国主义斗争的报告。他指出，无情地和始终一贯地进行反军国主义的斗争本身就会引导到革命成熟和党的巩固，它是革命精神活生生的泉源。这次会议决定建立“社会主义青年组织国际联合会”。
    1912年，李卜克内西当选为德国国会议员。这时正是德国军国主义者发动第一次世界大战的前夜。他在国会会议上愤怒地谴责了以“大炮大王”克虏伯为首的军火垄断组织煽动帝国主义战争的罪行。他说，这种军火工业的发展是对自己国家的威胁。他不断地向德国人民指出军国主义的危险性。在同年举行的社会民主党代表大会上，他号召巩固国际无产阶级的团结一致，作为对军国主义斗争的有力手段。
    正像其他德国社会民主党左派人物一样，李卜克内西当时还未能理解帝国主义和工人运动中的机会主义之间的关系，特别是机会主义思想在工人阶级内的危险性。经过列宁的帮助，李卜克内西很快就纠正了自己的错误。
    在第一次世界大战期间，在1915年5月，李卜克内西向德国人民指出：“主要的敌人在自己的国内”，这个敌人就是德国帝国主义。这个声明同当时俄国布尔什维克的“变帝国主义战争为国内战争”口号的精神是一致的。这种勇敢的革命行动，使他被捕并被判处四年苦役。在苦役期间他得到了十月革命胜利的消息。直到1918年10月，李卜克内西才获得自由。
    李卜克内西出狱后立即紧张工作起来，为新的、进步的德国创造社会基础，他积极参加和领导了德国十一月革命。但是，利用革命的工人和士兵的力量成立的“德意志共和国”政府，并没有触动帝国主义和军国主义势力的根本，反而给予反动派以抬头的机会。反动派在社会民主党右翼领袖的帮助之下，实现了扼杀革命和残害革命分子的阴谋。1919年1月15日，李卜克内西和罗莎·卢森堡一起被德国反动政府逮捕和杀害。
        罗莎·卢森堡
        （1871—1919）
    罗莎·卢森堡生于波兰，中学毕业后即走上了革命的道路，并成为波兰社会民主党创建人之一。1897年她迁居德国，作为波兰和立陶宛王国社会民主党领导人之一，同时也积极地参加了德国社会民主党的工作，进行了反对军国主义的斗争。
    卢森堡在1899年时批判了伯恩斯坦的修正主义，捍卫了阶级斗争和无产阶级必须夺取政权的学说。不过，她的反机会主义斗争是不彻底的，她当时不曾理解到必须在思想上和组织上同机会主义者划清界线。
    在第一次世界大战期间，卢森堡坚决反对德国社会民主党右翼领袖的政策，她致力于团结左派，反对帝国主义战争。她参与了德国革命组织“斯巴达克团”的建立。她同李卜克内西一起，在这一期间组织了多次的群众革命示威行动，并多次被捕入狱。
    在十月革命的影响下，卢森堡从俄国布尔什维克的经验中看到了关于无产阶级政党的作用和关于工农联盟等问题的重要性，因而纠正了她过去的错误。在她和李卜克内西的领导下，德国左派着手建立了共产党。
    卢森堡和李卜克内西一样，英勇地领导了反对德国资产阶级及其奴仆社会民主党右派的革命斗争，因而引起了反革命势力的疯狂仇视。1919年1月15日，在柏林工人的战斗失败以后，她和李卜克内西一起牺牲了。
