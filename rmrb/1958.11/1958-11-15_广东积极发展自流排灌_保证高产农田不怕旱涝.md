    This newspaper reports: Guangdong Province, according to its plan for next year to implement less planting of rice for high yield and more harvest, and the comprehensive development of cash crops, has begun water conservancy construction this winter and next spring.
    Guangdong Province plans to reduce the existing 34 million mu of rice area to 22 million mu next year. For early rice alone, the average yield is required to be 3,000 jin per mu, with 10% reaching 10,000 jin per mu. Due to the large-scale high yield, the requirements for drainage and irrigation are particularly strict and meticulous. Each mu of land must have a sufficient water source, with as much as needed when needed, and also be able to drain water quickly in heavy rain, so it does not accumulate on that day. In this way, from each irrigation area to each field, there must be a complete system of large and small drainage and irrigation channels and various forms of field surface ditches to form self-flowing irrigation, in order to implement scientific water use throughout the entire growth period of rice. At the same time, the 18 million mu of cash crops next year also require comprehensive high yields, and some major cash crops also need the same water conservancy conditions as rice fields. Therefore, the province's irrigation water consumption is more than double what it used to be. However, the province's existing water conservancy facilities still lack a complete drainage and irrigation system. Although the reservoir storage capacity of all water storage projects basically meets the requirements of this year's agricultural leap forward, it does not reach half of next year's demand, and flood and water disasters have not yet been overcome.
    In response to these new situations, Guangdong Province has decided that the focus of water conservancy construction this winter and next spring is to ensure that the 22 million mu of rice and more than 10 million mu of cash crops next year will achieve a bumper harvest even in the event of severe drought or heavy rain. The average water storage capacity per mu of these paddy fields will be increased from the current 300 to 500 cubic meters to 600 to 800 cubic meters. The drought resistance capacity will be increased from less than 40 days and about 60 days in the past to more than 120 days and 180 days. In addition, more than 10 million mu of dry slopes in the province must also ensure a water storage capacity of 250 cubic meters per mu.
    Because large and medium-sized projects account for only about 4/10,000 of the more than 1.7 million water conservancy projects built in the past few years, and large, medium, and small projects are isolated and scattered with small water storage capacity, they cannot meet next year's irrigation requirements. Now, according to the requirements of next year's cultivated areas and cultivation plans for water conservancy facilities, various places are re-planning and comprehensively managing rivers as the object and irrigation areas as the unit; starting from blocking and storing mountain floods and rainwater, developing water sources, and fundamentally controlling rivers to change the existing water conservancy situation. Of the more than 3 billion cubic meters of earth and stone planned to be completed this winter and next spring, which is nearly four times the amount of water conservancy work done last winter and this spring, the expansion and addition projects to change the existing water conservancy equipment system account for the vast majority. The more than 540 large and medium-sized projects that have already started or are preparing for construction are located in the areas where small projects are the most scattered and backbone projects are the most lacking. After these projects are completed, they will become the general hub of the diversion and storage system in their respective river basins or irrigation areas, and will play a role in regulating water volume in many "reservoir groups" composed of small projects. Each irrigation area is preparing to connect existing mountain ponds, reservoirs, rivers, and streams; adding a large number of newly dug water diversion channels, and building many diversion and storage combination projects along rivers and channels, so that rainwater from the sky, flowing water from rivers, and groundwater are connected and interconnected. In this way, the entire province, from mountainous areas, hills, plains to coastal areas, will form a "long vine bearing melons" and "grape bunch" self-flowing irrigation system that combines large, medium, and small sizes.
    The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all localities on the 6th that as soon as the autumn harvest ends, the province should immediately form a 3 million-strong water conservancy army, work hard for three months, and launch a water conservancy construction upsurge that is larger in scale, higher in quality, and faster in construction speed than last winter and this spring.

    广东积极发展自流排灌  保证高产农田不怕旱涝
    本报讯　广东省根据明年实行水稻少种高产多收，和经济作物全面发展的计划要求，已开始了今冬明春的水利建设。
    广东省计划明年把现有的三千四百万亩水稻面积，缩减到二千二百万亩。仅早稻一项，要求平均每亩产量三千斤，其中有10％每亩产量一万斤。由于大面积高产，因此，对排灌的要求特别严格和细致，每一亩田都要有十分充足的水源，做到要多少有多少；什么时候要什么时候有；也要做到大雨不积水，当天就能排泄。这样，从每个灌区到每一丘田都必需有完整的大小排灌渠道和各种形式的田面沟构成自流灌溉，才能在水稻整个生长期间实行科学用水。同时，明年一千八百万亩经济作物也要求全面高产，其中一些主要经济作物，也需要像稻田一样的水利条件。因此，全省的灌溉用水量，比过去高一倍以上。但是，全省现有的水利设备，还缺乏完整的排灌系统；全部蓄水工程的库容蓄水量虽然基本适应今年农业大跃进的要求，但达不到明年需水量的一半，涝灾、水灾也未过关。
    针对这些新情况，广东省决定今冬明春的水利建设，首先要确保明年二千二百万亩水稻与一千多万亩经济作物即使遇上大旱、大雨也要大丰收。这些水田平均每亩蓄水量要由现有的三、五百公方增加到六百公方、八百公方。抗旱能力从过去不到四十天和六十天左右，提高到一百二十天，一百八十天以上。此外，全省一千多万亩旱坡地，也要保证每亩蓄水量达二百五十公方。
    由于这几年兴建的一百七十多万宗水利工程中，大中型工程只占总宗数的万分之四左右，而且大中小型工程孤立分散，蓄水量小，不能满足明年灌溉要求。各地现在按照明年的耕作区和耕作规划对水利设施的要求，重新以河流为对象，以灌区为单位，进行统一规划，综合治理；从拦蓄山洪、雨水、开发水源、根治河流等各方面着手改变现有的水利面貌。今冬明春准备完成等于去冬今春水利工作量近四倍的三十多亿土石方中，改变现有水利设备系统的扩建和增建工程就占了绝大部分。已经动工或作施工准备的五百四十多宗大、中型工程，遍布在小型工程最零散和骨干工程最缺少的地区。这些工程建成后，将成为它们所在流域或灌区内引蓄系统的总枢纽，在许多由小型工程组成的“水库群”中起调节水量的作用。每个灌区都准备把现有的山塘、水库和河、溪联结在一起；加上新挖大量的引水渠道，以及沿河、沿渠增建许多引蓄结合的工程，好叫天上雨水、河中流水和地下水相连相通起来。这样，全省从山区、丘陵、平原到沿海地带，将形成一个大中小型相结合的“长藤结瓜式”、“葡萄串式”的自流灌溉系统。
    中共广东省委6日已指示各地，秋收一结束，全省立即要组成三百万水利大军，大干三个月，掀起一个比去冬今春工程规模更大、质量更高、施工速度更快的水利建设高潮。
