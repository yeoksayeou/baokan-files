Knowland's Political Dream Shattered

    The rejection of William Knowland, the Republican Senate leader and an important figure in the Republican Party's far-right wing, in this election is a significant sign that the U.S. ruling group's policy of hostility toward the Chinese people is facing serious opposition at home.

    Politicians in the United States and Western Europe are discussing the implications of Knowland's defeat. By simply reviewing Knowland's political career, it is not difficult for people to draw the conclusions they should:

    Rising from Anti-Communism

    Knowland, 50 years old, served as a state assemblyman in California from 1933, then as a state senator, and in 1938 he became a member of the Republican National Committee, and in 1941 he served as chairman of the Republican National Executive Committee for one year. Since 1945, he has been a senator from California in the U.S. Senate. He served as vice president and director of the Tribune Construction Company and Franklin Investment Company, so Knowland represents the economic interests of the West Coast region, which is the closest region in the United States to China.

    Knowland, McCarthy, and Taft were the three notorious "extreme anti-communist leaders" in the Republican Party. The latter two have died, leaving only Knowland alive. He holds the most reactionary and belligerent positions on general international issues, especially on China.

    Hostility Toward China

    In 1949, when the Chinese people were defeating Chiang Kai-shek's group's army with overwhelming force, Knowland rushed to Chongqing on the eve of its liberation in November, urging Chiang Kai-shek to "hold on for three months" so that he could "think of a comprehensive aid plan" after returning to the United States. This "comprehensive aid" did not arrive, and the Chiang Kai-shek group was quickly driven out of mainland China. After that, Knowland clamored for "never recognizing" the People's Republic of China and continued to advocate expanding U.S. military and economic assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan. In 1951 alone, Knowland spoke 103 times in the U.S. Congress on the issue of aiding the Chiang Kai-shek group.

    After the United States launched the Korean War in 1950, Knowland almost always clamored for expanding the war whenever he had the opportunity, advocating using U.S. planes to bomb Northeast China, dropping atomic bombs, the U.S. Navy blockading China, and using Chiang Kai-shek's group's army to harass the mainland, etc. After the armistice was reached in Korea, he actively advocated using this approach to expand the Indochina War in 1954. After the armistice was reached in Indochina, Knowland clamored in 1955 that if China did not release the detained American spies, the United States would impose economic sanctions and naval blockades on China.

    Knowland insisted that the United States must help the Chiang Kai-shek group "defend" the coastal islands. He suggested in 1955 that the United States use atomic weapons to "defend" Kinmen.

    Stubborn to the Core

    Knowland often made what American newspapers called "the most dramatic gestures" at Senate gatherings. "His face turned blue from excessive tension, desperately clenching and waving his fists, and the voice he made from the podium roared in the conference hall like an organ." In 1954, he gave a speech in this manner, declaring that if the United Nations allowed representatives of People's China to enter, he would resign from his position as Republican leader in the Senate and use all his strength to get the United States to withdraw from the United Nations. He repeatedly reiterated his "oath" on this issue in 1955 and 1956: as long as he "had a voice and a vote in the Senate, he would oppose it to the end."

    Knowland is known as the "Senator from Taiwan" because of the above records. He is the head of the reactionary "pro-China (Chiang) lobby" in the U.S. Congress.

    All reactionaries are good at daydreaming. In this election, Knowland was not satisfied with being a senator and was determined to become the governor of California, the second largest state in the United States, and then climb to the White House from the governor's seat. He forced his party opponent, Knight, to withdraw from the gubernatorial race, causing a storm of arguments throughout the state, so that Eisenhower had to personally mediate.

    A Crushing Defeat

    However, the once prominent Knowland was defeated in the November congressional elections and disappeared from the political stage. He not only lost his position as Republican leader in the Senate, lost his "bright" future of becoming governor and president, but, according to American newspapers, also ruined his own official career. He has returned to his hometown to work as an assistant publisher for a small newspaper. His unfortunate brothers, Republican far-rightists and "pro-China lobby" colleagues, Senators Alexander Smith and William Jenner, also fell with him.

    Knowland's fate is a portrayal of the current makers of American foreign policy. Knowland's failure is also a failure of the aggressive policy of hostility toward the Chinese people that the U.S. rulers are still trying to implement. People who mistake dreams for reality will sooner or later get their heads broken. This is how ruthless history is.

### 诺兰官场梦断

    诺兰官场梦断
    美国共和党参议院领袖、共和党内极右翼集团重要人物诺兰在这次选举中之被抛弃，是美国统治集团敌视中国人民政策在国内受到人民严重反对的一个显著标志。
    美国和西欧的政界人士都在纷纷议论诺兰落选这件事的含意。只要翻阅一下诺兰的政治经历，人们就不难从这件事得出应有的结论：
    反共起家
    诺兰，现年五十岁，1933年起任加利福尼亚州的州众议员，以后任该州的州参议员，1938年任共和党全国委员会委员，1941年任共和党全国执行委员会主席一年。他在1945年来就一直是美国参议院里加利福尼亚州的参议员。他担任过特里宾建筑公司和富兰克林投资公司副总裁兼董事，所以，诺兰是代表美国最接近中国的一个地区——西海岸地区的经济利益的。
    诺兰和麦卡锡、塔夫特同是共和党里臭名昭著的三个“极端反共首脑人物”，后两人已死，活着的就剩诺兰一人。他在一般国际问题上、尤其是中国问题上持有最反动的、好战的立场。
    仇视中国
    1949年，中国人民正以雷霆万钧之势击溃蒋介石集团军队之际，诺兰在11月重庆解放前夕赶到那里，要蒋介石“坚持三个月”，以待他返美后“必想出一个全面援助办法来”，这种“全面援助”并没有到来，而蒋介石集团就被迅速赶出了中国大陆。之后，诺兰又叫嚷“决不承认”中华人民共和国，并且一直鼓吹扩大美国对台湾蒋介石集团的军事及经济援助。仅仅在1951年一年里，诺兰在美国国会里就援助蒋介石集团问题作过一百零三次发言。
    1950年美国发动侵略朝鲜战争以后，诺兰几乎是每有机会就要叫嚣扩大战争，主张用美国飞机轰炸中国东北，投掷原子弹，美国海军对中国进行封锁，利用蒋介石集团军队骚扰大陆等等。在朝鲜达成停战以后，他在1954年又积极主张运用这一套办法来扩大印度支那战争。在印度支那达成停战以后，诺兰在1955年又叫嚷，如果中国不释放扣押着的美国间谍，美国就要对中国进行经济制裁和海军封锁。
    诺兰坚持美国必须帮助蒋介石集团“保卫”沿海岛屿。他在1955年建议美国用原子武器来“保卫”金门。
    顽固透顶
    诺兰是经常在参议院集会上作出美国报纸称为“最富戏剧性的姿态”的，“他的面孔由于过分紧张而变得发青，拼命握紧拳头挥舞，他在讲坛上发出的声音像架大风琴一样在会议厅里轰鸣。”他在1954年有一次又以这副模样发表演说，宣称如果联合国让人民中国代表进入，他就要辞去参议院共和党领袖职务，以全副力量用来使美国退出联合国。他在1955年、1956年还一再重复他在这个问题上的“誓言”：只要他“在参议院有发言权和投票权，就将反对到底”。
    诺兰便是以他上述这些纪录而被称为“来自台湾的参议员”的，他是美国国会里反动透顶的“院外援华（蒋）集团的首脑。
    一切反动派都好做白日梦。在这一次竞选中，诺兰嫌参议员不过瘾，一心想当美国第二大州——加州的州长，然后再由州长而爬上白宫的宝座。他强迫他党内的对手奈特退出州长竞选，引起了满州风雨的争吵，以至艾森豪威尔不得不亲自去调解。
    一败涂地
    但是，显赫一时的诺兰在11月的国会选举中落选了，从政治舞台上消失了。他不仅失去了共和党参议院领袖的职务，失去了当州长、总统的“美好”前途，而且据美国报纸说，还葬送了他自己的仕宦生涯。他已经回家乡去当一个小报的助理发行人去了。同他一起倒下去的还有他的难兄难弟、共和党极右翼和“院外援华集团”的伙计参议员亚历山大·史密斯和威廉·詹纳尔。
    诺兰的下场是当前美国外交政策制订者的写照。诺兰的失败也就是美国统治者现在还在极力推行的敌视中国人民的侵略政策的失败。把梦想当现实的人们迟早总要碰得头破血流，历史就是这样无情的。
