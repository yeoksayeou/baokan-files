	Iraq is one of the major oil-producing countries in the Middle East. In 1956, it produced 31 million tons of crude oil. In 1957, due to the impact of pipeline disruptions during the Suez War, oil production was 21 million tons, still ranking fourth in the Middle East. According to last year's statistics, Iraq's oil reserves are 3.55 billion tons, accounting for more than one-tenth of the total oil reserves in the capitalist world.
	Iraq's rich oil resources are completely controlled and plundered by Western oil monopoly groups. The largest of these is the Iraq Petroleum Company. This company is composed of British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, French Petroleum Company, Near East Development Corporation (American capital), and Participation and Exploration Corporation. The first four each hold 23.75% of the shares, and Participation and Exploration Corporation holds 5% of the shares. The Iraq Petroleum Company's mining area is located in the area east of the Tigris River in Baghdad Province and Mosul Province, with a total area of more than 32,000 square miles, almost one-tenth of Iraq's entire territory. The concession period is 75 years from March 14, 1925, and will not expire until the year 2000.
	In addition, the Basra Petroleum Company and the Mosul Petroleum Company also suck the blood of Iraqi oil. The former exploits oil fields near Basra and the Iraqi part of the "neutral zone," with the concession expiring in 2013. The latter mainly exploits the Mosul oil fields west of the Tigris River, with the concession expiring in 2007. The share distribution ratio of these two companies is the same as that of the Iraq Petroleum Company.
	The Khanaqin Oil Company is the oldest company in Iraq, solely invested by British Petroleum. It obtained the concession on May 28, 1901, with a concession period of 60 years, which was extended by another 35 years in May 1926, expiring in 1996. Its mining area is the Naft Khaneh oil field in eastern Iraq. This oil field has a relatively small output, and its products mainly supply the Iraqi domestic market.

    在伊拉克的外国石油公司
    伊拉克是中东盛产石油的国家之一。1956年共产石油三千一百万吨。1957年，由于受到苏伊士战争期间油管中断的影响，产油二千一百万吨，但仍占中东第四位。伊拉克石油储量据去年统计有三十五亿五千万吨。占资本主义世界石油总储量十分之一以上。
    伊拉克丰富的石油资源，完全为西方石油垄断集团所控制和掠夺。其中最大的是伊拉克石油公司。这家公司是由英国石油公司、英荷壳牌石油公司、法国石油公司、近东开发公司（美国资本）、参加与开发公司组成。前四家各占23.75％股份，参加与开发公司占5％股份。伊拉克石油公司开采地区位于巴格达省和摩苏尔省底格里斯河以东地区，总面积在三万二千平方英里以上，差不多等于伊拉克全部领土的十分之一。租让年限自1925年3月14日起，共七十五年，要到公元二千年才满期。
    此外，吮吸伊拉克石油的，尚有巴士拉石油公司和摩苏尔石油公司。前者开采巴士拉附近和“中立地”内的伊拉克部分地区的油田，租让期至2013年期满。后者主要开采底格里斯河以西的摩苏尔油田，租让期至2007年期满。这两家公司的股份分配比例都和伊拉克石油公司一样。
    汉纳金石油公司是伊拉克境内最老的一家公司，由英国石油公司单独投资。1901年5月28日取得租让权，租让期六十年，1926年5月又延长三十五年，至1996年期满。它的开采区域是伊弗拉克东部的纳特·坎内油田。这个油田产量较小，产品主要供给伊拉克国内市场。
