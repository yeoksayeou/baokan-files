    "Let me block it!"
    This day at noon, the workers were busily digging ore when suddenly a large ore stone weighing over 300 pounds rolled down the mountain towards them. The ore rolled faster and faster, but the people digging in the mine pit below hadn't noticed and were still working hard. What a dangerous moment! If the ore hit them, who knows how many people would be injured or killed! Just at this moment, a young man in his twenties was carrying a load of ore when he saw the scene and quickly put down his load. He used his body to block the ore, muttering to himself, "Let me block it! I must not let my comrades get hurt." This person was Zhang Pijin, a youth shock team member from the Fifth Company of the Fourth Battalion of the Yanjia Tuo Mining Area in Shishou County, Hubei Province.
    The ore was blocked, and the safety of the comrades was ensured, but Zhang Pijin was injured all over, with a large hole in his foot and blood flowing freely. The comrades sent him to the clinic. Seeing how urgent the mining task was, he couldn't settle down to rest and asked to work as soon as his wound was a little better. He requested of the leadership, "Although my foot can't walk, I can do things sitting down. Let me go to the kitchen to help with chopping vegetables and washing dishes, and temporarily transfer someone from the kitchen to dig ore." The leadership agreed to his suggestion.
    Soon, a cook with a limp appeared in the kitchen. Unable to walk, he sat all day washing dishes, washing vegetables, and chopping vegetables, doing as much work as anyone else. (Attached image)

    “让我来挡住它！”
    这天中午，工人们正在紧张地挖着矿石，忽然山上一块三百多斤重的大矿石向他们冲下来。矿石越滚越急，可是下面矿坑里挖矿石的人谁也没有发觉，仍在使劲地挖着。多危险的时刻呵！要是矿石打下来，还不知会死伤几个人呢！就在这个时候，一个二十多岁的小伙子正挑着一担矿石走过来，他看到这情景急忙放下担子，一面用自己的身体去挡住矿石，一面自言自语地说：“让我来挡住它！决不能叫同志们受伤。”这人就是湖北省石首县鄢家沱矿区四营五连的青年突击队员张丕金。
    矿石是挡住了，同志们的安全也保住了，可是张丕金全身却受了伤，脚上被打了个大洞，鲜血直流。同志们把他送到了医务室。他见采矿任务这样紧，哪里还能安下心来养伤，伤口稍好一点就要求工作。他向领导上要求说：“我的脚虽不能走，坐着的事还可以做，让我到厨房去帮着切菜、洗碗吧，在厨房里暂抽一个人去挖矿。”领导上同意了他的意见。
    不久，厨房里就出现了一个跛着一条腿的厨师，他不能走路，成天坐着洗碗、洗菜、切菜，干的活比谁也不少。（附图片）
