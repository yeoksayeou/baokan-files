    Problems Seen from Murals in Xi'an City
    Shi Zikang

    In the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, the masses of workers and peasants in the Shaanxi region, like those throughout the country, also launched a mass mural movement. Taking Xi'an City as an example, 154,947 murals were painted in just over twenty days, with many villages achieving two murals per household, realizing the muralization of the entire city. More than 10,000 people, including workers, peasants, women, students, cadres, and professional art workers, participated in the painting, forming an unprecedentedly high-spirited mass art movement, and producing many excellent mass painters. Currently, in conjunction with the propaganda against U.S. imperialist aggression and for the liberation of Taiwan, the mural movement continues to develop. Some areas have organized the painters who emerged during the movement and are conducting professional studies to guide mass art creation towards in-depth and multi-faceted development.

    In this movement, we feel that some issues deserve attention and research.

    The mural movement is a political propaganda movement, a mass art movement, a movement in which the masses, in conjunction with current central tasks and production, engage in self-education in artistic form, and also a cultural revolution in the field of mass art. Therefore, like other movements, it must put politics in command, be personally led by Party committees and governments at all levels, and must implement the mass line, fully mobilize the masses, break down superstitions, emancipate the mind, shatter the mystical notions of art creation, and arouse the creative enthusiasm of the masses. Any approach that blindly trusts experts, does not believe in the masses, and relies on experts or a small number of people to monopolize and replace the masses is wrong. Facts have proven that in areas where the Party committee takes the lead, provides concrete leadership, and fully mobilizes the masses, murals not only reflect their enthusiasm in production and embody the spirit of the times, but also, in turn, serve production and serve politics, becoming a powerful tool for inspiring production enthusiasm, raising political awareness, and transforming customs.

    Like other work, mural work must also implement the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results. We advocate simplicity, adapting to local conditions, using both color and ink, emphasizing both large and small works, and diversifying forms of expression; achieving economy and beauty under the premise of correct propaganda of policies and guidelines. Through the mural movement, we must not only inspire the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people in building socialism, but also beautify the living environment and enrich the spiritual life of the people. Many peasants, after realizing muralization in their villages, said: "This is what a socialist countryside should look like." Some said: "Our villages are even more beautiful than some streets in the city." In this regard, the masses also have many creations; some paint directly on earthen walls, some wield brushes on brick walls, some use paper-cutting forms of expression, and some use traditional ink painting techniques, all of which are economical and beautiful. For example, the Xujiazhuang Production Brigade of the Dongfeng People's Commune painted 213 murals, spending only 9 yuan and 50 cents on paint.

    The development of the mural movement, the large-scale production of new mass art creations, and the emergence of a large number of amateur worker-peasant painters have significant meaning and far-reaching impact on the development of the socialist art movement.

    Although murals have a historical tradition of several thousand years, in the past they always resided in official residences, temples, grottoes, or tombs, and were occupied by the rulers. Today, they have reached the hands of the masses, and painting is everywhere in streets, lanes, and villages, becoming a social art form that is visible to the masses; like comic strips and New Year pictures, it is an important form of mass popularization of art works. And its characteristics are even better at reflecting the face of the times in huge format and expressing major themes, coupled with its sociality, mass character, and collectivity, so this art form is mastered by the masses and becomes the mainstream of the mass art movement; it has an undeniable significance and role. Mural production is not restricted by other production conditions and can be developed on a large scale. In some areas, not only have streets been transformed into art galleries, but also "murals have entered courtyards" and "murals have entered rooms." Adapting to buildings of different nature, different forms, and different geological conditions, the masses have many creations in handling themes and expressive techniques, greatly promoting the diverse development of mural forms. At the same time, the masses' own creations are always closely related to the objective reality of the time and place in terms of subject matter, whether it is criticism or praise, praise or lyricism, whether it is based on real people and events or expressed with bold ideals, so its education and influence on the audience are particularly vivid, intimate, profound and timely. Although the masses' murals are relatively rough in technique, this is the result of the ruling class monopolizing culture and art for thousands of years. It is precisely because of this that they will massively and keenly absorb beneficial nutrients from all sides in the process of cultural revolution, coupled with the foundation of their own rich and long-standing folk art traditions, they will rapidly improve in their continuous practice. Of course, this mural movement is only the beginning of the realization of the cultural revolution in art by the masses. But we believe that it will change from a blitz activity to a regular one, constantly developing and continuously improving; especially under the conditions of the rapid development of the people's communes, murals will surely become the giant art of the socialist era.

    The murals of the masses vividly express the socialist spirit of the times, overflowing with socialist thoughts, feelings and style. Like the impact of folk songs on new poetry, it injects new blood into our art creation. Because the masses have rich perceptual knowledge of production struggle and class struggle, and cherish the lofty ideals of conquering nature and transforming the world, the subject matter, conception, and expressive techniques of many excellent works are full of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. They exaggerate a corn kernel, an ear of wheat, a cotton boll, and a pig in a mythical way, but these are not empty images, but extraordinary ideals built on ordinary things; they are precisely enough to express the true content of reality. In the face of these mass creations full of revolutionary romanticism, those so-called naturalistic works that describe things as they are will appear dull. Many art workers who make murals with the masses deeply feel that not only should ideological transformation be combined with the masses, but also art creation should learn from the masses. Only in this way can we truly serve the masses and serve the masses well. Secondly, the wide range of subject matter, the diverse forms of expression, and the colorful artistic styles of mass creation have opened up a broad road for our art creation and brought far-reaching influence to professional creation. In addition, large-scale murals created by the general public are mostly carried out collectively with everyone suggesting topics, discussing them, giving play to the wisdom of the masses, and contributing their talents. The painting work is also often carried out through division of labor and cooperation such as drafting, coloring, and outlining. This also greatly inspires professional creation to move towards collective forms.

    The development of mass art also has a repeated process of popularization and improvement. The mural movement has set off a wave of mass art activities. It has opened up a broad road for popularization work and brought far-reaching influence to the new art movement. After making a big fuss about popularization, we must seize the training of mass painters and the research and guidance of mass creation, and combine experts and the masses to promote the continuous upsurge of the mass art movement. Excellent mass painters should be absorbed as members of the association to strengthen the socialist art ranks.

    从西安市壁画看到的问题
    石梓康
    在工农业生产大跃进的同时，陕西地区的工农群众与全国各地一样也出现了群众性的壁画运动。仅以西安市为例，在二十多天中就绘制了壁画十五万四千九百四十七幅，许多村达到每户有壁画二幅。实现全市壁画化。参加绘画的有工人、农民、妇女、学生、干部及专业美术工作者共一万余人；形成了空前高涨的群众美术运动，涌现出许多优秀的群众画手。目前结合反对美帝侵略，解放台湾的宣传，壁画运动还在继续发展。有些地区已把运动中涌现出的画手组织起来，并开展了业务学习，把群众美术创作导向深入的，多方面的发展。
    在这一运动中，我们感到有些问题，值得重视和研究。
    壁画运动是一个政治宣传运动；也是一个群众美术运动，是群众结合当前中心工作，结合生产，以美术形式进行自我教育的运动，也是群众美术方面的文化革命。因此，它和其他运动一样必须政治挂帅，各级党政亲自领导，必须贯彻群众路线，充分发动群众，破除迷信，解放思想，打破美术创作的神秘观念，鼓起群众创作热情。任何迷信专家，不相信群众，依靠专家或少数人包办代替的作法都是错误的。事实证明，凡是党委挂帅，具体领导，充分发动群众的地区，壁画不仅反映了他们在生产上的干劲，体现了时代的精神面貌，同时，反过来又服务于生产，服务于政治，成为鼓舞生产热情，提高政治觉悟，移风易俗的有力工具。
    壁画工作也和其他工作一样，必须贯彻多快好省的方针。我们提倡因陋就简，因地制宜，彩墨并举，大小并举和表现形式的多样化；在正确宣传方针、政策的前提下作到经济、美观。通过壁画运动既要鼓舞人民群众建设社会主义的革命干劲，也要美化生活环境，丰富人民群众的精神生活。许多农民在他们村里实现壁画化后。有的说：“这才像社会主义的农村了”。有的说：“咱们农村比城市一些街巷还漂亮”。在这方面群众也有许多创造，有的就土墙作画，有的就砖墙挥笔，有的运用剪纸形式表现，有的利用水墨画的传统技法，都很经济而美观。如东风人民公社徐家庄生产大队画了二百一十三幅壁画，才花了九元五角的颜料钱。
    壁画运动的开展，新的群众美术创作大量产生，业余的工农画手大量出现，对社会主义美术运动的发展具有重大的意义和深远的影响。
    壁画尽管有着几千年的历史传统，但过去总是栖身于官庭庙堂、石窟或坟墓，为统治者所占有。今天到了群众手里，街巷、村头到处皆画，成为群众触目可见的社会性的艺术样式；它和连环画、年画一样是美术作品大量普及的重要形式。而它的特点又更长于以巨辐形式反映时代的面貌，表现重大题材，加以它的社会性、群众性和集体性，所以，这种艺术形式为群众掌握且成为群众美术运动的主流；更具有不可低估的意义和作用。壁画制作不受其他生产条件的限制，可以大量发展，有些地区不仅街头变画廊，而且是“壁画进院”，“壁画进房”了。适应不同性质，不同形式，不同地质的建筑物，群众在处理题材与表现手法上也有很多创造，大大促进了壁画形式的多样发展。同时，群众自己的创作在取材上总是密切联系当时、当地的客观实际的，无论是批评或表扬，歌颂或抒情，或以真人真事为题材，或以大胆的理想来表现，所以它对观众的教育和影响就特别生动、亲切、深刻而及时。虽然，群众的壁画在技巧上比较粗糙，这是几千年来统治阶级霸占文化艺术的结果。也正由于这样，他们在文化革命的进程中会大量的锐敏的吸收来自各方的有益营养，加之他们有着自己丰富而悠久的民间艺术传统的基础，在其不断实践中必将迅速的提高。当然，这次壁画运动只是群众在美术方面实现文化革命的开端。但我们相信它将由突击性的活动变为经常，不断发展，不断提高；特别是在人民公社迅速发展的条件下，壁画必将成为社会主义时代的巨型艺术。
    群众的壁画鲜明的表现出社会主义的时代精神面貌，洋溢着社会主义的思想感情和风格。它像民歌对新诗的冲击作用一样给我们的美术创作注入了新的血液。由于群众具有生产斗争和阶级斗争的丰富的感性知识，怀着征服自然，改造世界的远大理想，许多优秀作品的取材、构思以及其表现手法都充满了革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义。他们把一颗玉米、一颗麦穗，一颗棉桃、一口猪作神话式的夸张，但这不是空虚的形象，而是建筑在平凡事物上的不平凡的理想；正足以表现现实的真实内容。在这些富有革命的浪漫主义色彩的群众创作面前，那些所谓如实描写的自然主义作品，就会显得黯然无光。许多和群众一起搞壁画的美术工作者都深深感到不仅思想改造上要与群众结合，即在艺术创作上也要向群众学习。只有这样才能真正做到为群众服务、为群众服务得好。其次，群众创作取材的广泛，表现形式和艺术风格的多彩，都为我们美术创作打开了宽广的道路，给专业创作带来深远的影响。此外，一般群众创作的大型壁画，大都是大家出题、大家讨论，发挥群众智慧，各尽长才而集体进行的。绘制工作也常是以放稿、涂色、勾线等分工合作。这对专业创作走向集体形式也有很大启发。
    群众美术的发展，也有普及与提高的反复过程。壁画运动掀起了群众美术活动的热潮。为普及工作开辟了广阔的道路，给新美术运动带来了深远的影响。在大闹普及以后，我们就必须抓紧群众画手的培养工作和群众创作的研究、引导专家与群众的结合，来促进群众美术运动的不断高涨。对于优秀的群众画手应吸收为协会会员，壮大社会主义的美术队伍。
