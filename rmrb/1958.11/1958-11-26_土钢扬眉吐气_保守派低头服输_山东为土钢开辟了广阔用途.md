　　Indigenous Steel Holds Its Head High, Conservatives Bow Their Heads in Submission
　　Shandong Opens Up Broad Uses for Indigenous Steel

　　(Our Dispatch from Jinan, November 25) The broad masses of workers in various steel plants and machinery manufacturing departments in Shandong Province are using indigenous steel to roll steel products and manufacture various tools. In order to open up broad uses for indigenous steel, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Party committees at all levels launched mass debates, using facts to refute arguments that indigenous steel could not accomplish great things. After indigenous steel held its head high and conservatives bowed their heads in submission, the Party Committee Secretary and workers of the Qingdao Rolling Mill jointly conducted numerous studies, figured out the laws of using indigenous steel, and rolled out very good round steel and flat steel. The first batch of steel products rolled out by this mill, after testing, contained 0.16% carbon, 0.19% silicon, 0.1% sulfur, 0.13% phosphorus, a tensile strength of 36 kilograms per square centimeter, and an elongation rate of 19%. Machinery factories and red furnace units in various places have also explored the many fire-refining and forging experiences created by the Chinese people over thousands of years, using the method of "refining a hundred times becomes steel" and repeated burning and hammering to forge a large amount of indigenous steel into various farm tools and light tools. The Weifang Machinery Factory and Cooperative No. 2 Factory, using indigenous steel produced in the city, have trial-produced 15 kinds of products such as round-mouth adzes, pickaxes, hoes, and axles after improving the quality through forging, some of which have very good quality. The First and Seventh Machinery Factories of the Qingdao Municipal Handicraft Bureau have also initially grasped operational experiences different from using foreign steel to manufacture products. For example, according to the different properties of indigenous steel, appropriately control the firing temperature for forging. General indigenous steel must be burned to about 1,000 degrees before forging. If it is over-fired, it will become slag; if the temperature is not enough, the quality of the forged product will not meet the requirements. When forging, master the principles of light and fast hammering, from light to heavy. To overcome the defects of loose structure and easy cracking due to many impurities in indigenous steel, they appropriately increase the number of smelting and forging operations. Facts have proved that indigenous steel is not only a good raw material for manufacturing agricultural tools, but also can be used to manufacture some machine parts.

    土钢扬眉吐气　保守派低头服输
    山东为土钢开辟了广阔用途
    本报济南25日电　山东省各炼钢厂和机械制造部门广大职工，用土钢轧成钢材和制成多种工具。中共山东省委和各级党委为了给土钢开辟广阔用途，曾发动广大群众开展鸣放辩论，用事实驳倒了那些认为土钢办不了大事的议论。使土钢扬眉吐气，保守派低头服输以后。青岛轧钢厂党委书记和职工共同进行了多次研究，摸到了使用土钢的规律，轧制出很不错的元钢和扁钢。这个厂轧出的第一批钢材，经过化验含炭0.16、矽0.19、硫0.1、磷0.13、抗张强度为每平方公分三十六公斤，延伸率19％。各地的机械厂和红炉单位，还发掘了我国人民几千年来创造的许多火炼锻打的经验，以“百炼成钢”、烧烧打打的办法，把大量土钢锻打成多种农具和轻便工具。潍坊市的机械厂和合作二厂，用本市生产的土钢，经过锻打提高质量后，已试制成元口锛、洋镐、锄头、车轴等十五种产品，其中有几种轻便用具的质量很好。青岛市手工业局第一、第七机械厂还初步摸到了用土钢制造产品与洋钢不同的操作经验。如根据土钢的不同性质，适当掌握锻造的火候，一般的土钢要烧到一千度左右才锻造，如果烧过了火就锻渣了，火候不够锻造出的产品质量也达不到要求；在锻打时，掌握轻打、快打，由轻到重；在克服土钢的组织松弛和因含杂质较多容易爆裂的缺点，他们就适当增加熔炼和锻打次数。事实证明：土钢不仅是制造农具的好原料，而且可以造一些机器部件。
