Coal Piles Up Like Mountains, Industrial Orders Decrease
West German Economy Shows a Downturn

    (Reported) West Germany's coal mining industry is currently facing the biggest sales crisis in German history. By the second half of October, the amount of unsold coal and coke piled up in warehouses had exceeded 11 million tons, 3.5 million tons more than the total amount of unsold coal during the most severe period of the economic crisis of 1930.

    This coal crisis began in February this year. The main cause of the crisis is the reduction in production caused by the decrease in orders in the steel industry, shipbuilding industry, and machinery manufacturing industry. The large decrease in orders has caused the first downward trend in West German industry since the war. For example, from January 1 to the end of September this year, the production of pig iron, crude steel, and cast metal products in West Germany all decreased by 6.3%, 3.7%, and 7.8% respectively compared with the same period last year. At present, the utilization rate of equipment in the steel monopoly enterprises in the Ruhr area can only reach about 75%. This reduction in steel production in West Germany has been seen by British industrialists as a new signal of a global recession.

    Now West German business owners are trying their best to pass on the losses of the crisis to the workers. Recently, 6,000 steel workers in the Ruhr area have been laid off. Since February, coal mine owners have forced more than 176,000 miners to take 1.5 million instances of compulsory "work stoppages," resulting in a loss of 40.5 million marks in wages for the miners. Currently, 45% of miners' families are in debt. But the capitalists are not satisfied with this. Not long ago, a person in charge of industrial and mining enterprises in the Ruhr area publicly stated that if the coal crisis continues, one-third of the mines will be closed, forcing "150,000 workers to go home."

### 存煤堆成山　工业订货少  西德经济出现下降趋势

    存煤堆成山　工业订货少
    西德经济出现下降趋势
    本报讯　目前西德煤矿业正面临着德国历史上最大的一次销售危机。到10月下半月止，仅仅堆在仓库里卖不出去的煤和焦炭已突破一千一百万吨大关，比1930年经济危机最严重时期的滞销煤总额还多三百五十万吨。
    这次煤业危机是从今年2月开始的。造成危机的主要原因，是钢铁工业、造船工业和机器制造业由于订货的减少而造成的生产上的缩减。订货的大量减少使西德工业出现了战后第一次下降趋势。如从今年1月1日到9月底西德的生铁、原钢和铸金属产品的生产都分别较去年同期降低了6.3％、3.7％、7.8％。目前鲁尔区各钢铁垄断企业的设备利用率只能达到75％左右。西德钢铁工业的这种减产曾被英国工业人士看做发生世界性衰退的新信号。
    现在西德的企业主竭力把危机的损失转嫁到工人的头上。最近鲁尔区的钢铁工人已有六千人被解雇。从2月以来煤矿主已迫使十七万六千多名矿工实行了一百五十万次的强制性“歇工”，使矿工们因此而损失的工资达四千零五十万马克。现在已经有45％的矿工家庭负了债。但是资本家还不以此为满足，不久前鲁尔区工矿企业的一个负责人公开表示，如果煤业危机继续下去的话，就要关闭三分之一的矿井，迫令“十五万工人回家去”。
