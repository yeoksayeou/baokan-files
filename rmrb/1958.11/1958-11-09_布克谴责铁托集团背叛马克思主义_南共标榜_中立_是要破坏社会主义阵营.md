    Bukharin Condemns Tito Group for Betraying Marxism
    Yugoslav Communists Flaunt "Neutrality" to Undermine Socialist Camp

    This newspaper reports that Tim Bukharin, General Secretary of the Labor Progressive Party of Canada, published an article criticizing Yugoslav revisionists in the party's organ "Marxist Review" on September 8th.

    The article says that after the Belgrade Declaration was issued, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union patiently tried to improve relations and provided Yugoslavia with generous fraternal material assistance. However, after the meeting of sixty-four communist and workers' parties in Moscow, the Yugoslav leaders began to prepare for their Seventh National Congress, which was held only six months later, as if the central purpose of this congress was to oppose and condemn the declaration of the twelve communist parties, and to present a series of anti-Marxist arguments developed by the Yugoslav leaders to oppose the long-tested principles and practices of the international movement. They turned the congress into a forum to attack the world communist movement, especially to attack the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in secret, claiming that the United States found reasons to organize the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and occupy foreign strategic bases with troops because of the Soviet Union's policies.

    They used this congress to announce their disassociation from Marxist-Leninist parties and their ideological opposition to these parties. They insisted that these Marxist-Leninist parties were dogmatic, full of illusions, and subjective. As if to emphasize that their actions were deliberate, Tito said that anyone who expected the Yugoslav Communist Party to change the position stated at the party congress would be wasting their time.

    The article points out that they regard the socialist camp as a military bloc, comparing it to the capitalist camp (they slanderously said that the Soviet Union bears most of the responsibility for the formation of military blocs). They emphasize that Yugoslavia does not belong to any "group" or camp, and that Yugoslavia is taking a third path, which is said to be independent of the socialist camp and the imperialist camp.

    All the speeches at the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress systematically tried to deny the decisive importance of the world being divided into two world systems, distorting the historical situation of the world being divided into two world systems into two hostile groups engaged in power politics, while using a confusing illusion to counter the solidarity of socialist countries, saying that the real "principled" path is not the consolidation and progress of the solidarity of socialist countries, but neutrality.

    The article says that the program adopted by the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress is full of neutral illusions. Its definition of the basis of Yugoslavia's foreign policy and Yugoslavia's attitude towards other socialist countries is not proletarian internationalism, but an attempt to decorate neutralism with Marxist words.

    The Yugoslav Communist Party program does not have a single word distinguishing the policies of socialist countries from those of imperialists, but only distinguishes between its so-called "group" policy and neutral policy. It expressed a negative attitude towards the socialist world, especially towards the Soviet Union. It emphasized its determination to maintain and develop the United Nations organization, and once again condemned the groups, but did not put forward the demand to defeat the imperialist warmongers.

    The article emphasizes that the political position adopted by the Yugoslav Communist Party program and the Seventh National Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party, which Tito described as neutralism, would mean that they were politically separated from the imperialist camp if it were done by President Nasser of the United Arab Republic or Prime Minister Nehru of India. But if a party that claims to be communist and a government that flaunts Marxism-Leninism adopts such a position, it means that it is politically separated from the socialist camp, which Tito admitted in his main speech at the congress.

    Neutralism against the imperialist conspiracy to create war is a welcome ally in the world's struggle for peace and socialism. However, while neutralism is a welcome ally, it will not prevent a world war by itself, it certainly cannot prevent it, and it cannot become a means to achieve socialism.

    The article says that it is undeniable that the key to the transition to socialism on a world scale is the consolidation and unity of socialist countries, uniting the majority of mankind around them. It must be emphasized that this is an indispensable factor in this era of socialist transition. However, Tito opposes the unity of progressive forces around the world to the world socialist camp.

    The article says that Lenin emphasized the international nature of revisionism fifty years ago. He wrote at the time: "The inevitability of revisionism is determined by its class roots. Revisionism is an international phenomenon." It is now quite obvious that the revisionism expressed in the Yugoslav Communist Party program is not limited to Yugoslavia.

    The article continues, that in Canada, as in Yugoslavia, there is a clear contradiction between the words of the revisionists and the reality of their political role. For example, although those who pretend to be "Canadianized" demand that party members abandon proletarian internationalism, they themselves are actually representatives in Canada of an international group organized according to a revisionist program. They are trying to persuade Canadian communists to abandon internationalism by pretending that it contradicts the Canadianism of our party. Their argument is false, and the members have recognized that this argument is false.

    The article concludes by saying, that even worse than the fact that their arguments are wrong is that they are directed by an international attempt to undermine the world communist movement, and they are certainly part of this international attempt, and not out of concern for Canada and the Canadian workers' movement. Their sudden desire to establish a "new socialist front," their demand to end the principle of minority subordination to the majority, and their sudden illusion that progress can be easily achieved through cooperative alliances are all old ideas they have borrowed from European revisionists, and these old ideas have now been brought together by the Yugoslav Communist Party program in "substance and in words." Their pro-Canadian pretext is an attempt to disguise their anti-Leninist attitude.

### 布克谴责铁托集团背叛马克思主义  南共标榜“中立”是要破坏社会主义阵营

    布克谴责铁托集团背叛马克思主义
    南共标榜“中立”是要破坏社会主义阵营
    本报讯　加拿大劳工进步党总书记提姆·布克在9月8日出版的党的机关刊物“马克思主义评论”上发表了一篇批判南斯拉夫修正主义者的文章。
    文章说，在贝尔格莱德宣言发表之后，苏联共产党耐心地设法改善关系，同时给予南斯拉夫慷慨的兄弟般的物质援助。但是在莫斯科召开了六十四国共产党和工人党会议之后，南共领导人着手筹备在此之后仅仅六个月召开的他们的第七次全国代表大会，好像这次代表大会的中心目的就是反对和谴责十二国共产党宣言，和提出经过南共领导人发挥的一系列反马克思主义论点，来反对国际运动的久经考验的原则和实践。他们把代表大会变成一个讲坛，来攻击世界共产主义运动，特别是暗中攻击苏联共产党，宣称由于苏联的政策，美国找到了组织北大西洋公约组织和用军队占领外国战略基地的理由。
    他们利用这次代表大会来宣布他们同马克思列宁主义的政党脱离关系，而且在意识形态方面反对这些政党，他们硬说这些马克思列宁主义的政党是教条主义的、充满错觉的和主观的。好像是为了强调他们的行动是经过深思熟虑的，铁托说，任何人期望南共改变在党代表大会上所阐明的立场，都将是浪费时间。
    文章指出，他们把社会主义阵营看成是军事集团，同资本主义阵营相提并论（他们诽谤地说军事集团形成的大部分责任在于苏联）。他们强调南斯拉夫不属于任何“集团”或阵营，并且说什么南斯拉夫走的是第三条道路，据说是独立于社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营之外的。
    南共代表大会上的所有发言都有系统地竭力否认世界分成两个世界体系的决定性的重要意义，把世界分成为两个世界体系的历史性局面曲解为两个从事强权政治的敌对集团，同时以一种迷惑人的幻想来对抗社会主义国家的团结，说什么真正的“原则性”的道路不是社会主义国家的巩固团结和进步而是中立。
    文章说，南共代表大会所通过的纲领充满了中立的幻想。它对南斯拉夫对外政策的基础和南斯拉夫对其他社会主义国家的态度所下的定义并不是无产阶级国际主义的，而是企图以马克思主义的字眼来装饰中立主义。
    南共纲领没有一个字眼把社会主义国家的政策同帝国主义者的政策加以区别，而只是把它所谓的“集团”政策和中立政策加以区别。它对社会主义世界表示了否定的态度，特别是对苏联表示了否定的态度。它强调了维护和发展联合国组织的决心，并且对集团再一次提出谴责，但是却没有提出挫败帝国主义战争煽动分子的要求。
    文章强调指出，南共纲领和南共第七次代表大会所采取的政治立场，铁托把它说成是中立主义。如果是阿联的纳赛尔总统或者印度的尼赫鲁总理那样做的话，这就意味着他们在政治上脱离帝国主义阵营。但是如果一个自称是共产主义的政党和一个标榜着马克思列宁主义的政府采取这样一种立场的话，这就意味着它在政治上脱离社会主义阵营，这是铁托在这次代表大会上的主要发言中所承认的。
    反对帝国主义制造争战的阴谋的中立主义，是世界上争取和平与社会主义的斗争中值得欢迎的同盟者。然而中立主义作为一个同盟者固然值得欢迎，但是它本身并不会防止世界大战，它的确无法防止，而它更不能成为达到社会主义的手段。
    文章说，无可争论的是，在世界规模上向社会主义过渡的关键是社会主义国家的巩固团结，把人类的大部分团结在它们的周围。必须强调指出，这是现在这个社会主义过渡时代的不可缺少的因素。但是，铁托却把全世界进步力量的团结同世界社会主义阵营对立起来。
    文章说，列宁在五十年前曾强调修正主义的国际性质，他当时写道：“修正主义之不可避免是由它的阶级根源所决定的。修正主义是一种国际现象”。现在相当明显，南共纲领所表现的修正主义并不限于南斯拉夫。
    文章接着说，在加拿大像在南斯拉夫一样，修正主义者的言论和他们的政治作用的实际之间有着明显的矛盾。例如，虽然那些冒充“加拿大化的人”要求党员抛弃无产阶级国际主义，但是他们本人实际上却是一个根据修正主义的纲领组织起来的国际集团在加拿大的代表。他们企图说服加拿大的共产党人抛弃国际主义，办法是假装认为它是同我们党的加拿大主义相矛盾的。他们的论点是虚假的，而且党员们已经认识到这种论点是虚假的。
    文章最后说，但是，比他们的论点是错误的这一事实更坏的是：他们是被一种打算破坏世界共产主义运动的国际企图所指使的，同时他们肯定地是这种国际企图的一部分，而决不是出自对加拿大和加拿大工人运动的关心。他们突然渴望成立“一个新的社会主义阵线”，他们要求结束少数服从多数的原则，他们突然幻想通过合作联盟容易地取得进展，所有这一切都是他们从欧洲的修正主义者那里借来的陈旧观念，现在这些陈旧观念已由南共纲领在“实质上和文字上”集其大成。他们的亲加拿大主义的借口是一种掩饰他们的反列宁主义态度的企图。
