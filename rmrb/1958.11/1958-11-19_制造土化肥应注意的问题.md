    Issues to Note When Manufacturing Indigenous Fertilizer
    Xiong Yi, Chen Jiafang

    Summarizing the factors contributing to high yields in agriculture across various regions, aside from deep plowing, fertilization is also a significant factor.

    To apply fertilizer in large quantities, it is first necessary to have large quantities of high-quality fertilizer. Over the past year, under the correct leadership of the Party, the masses have demonstrated vigor and wisdom, not only launching a nationwide fertilizer accumulation campaign but also initiating a high tide of fertilizer improvement and large-scale indigenous fertilizer production, playing a role in the great leap forward in agricultural production. Recently, the Institute of Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed 460 samples of farm manure from Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces, and the soil team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed more than 70 samples of farm manure from Hebei Province and suburban Beijing. The results of the identification show that many fertilizers are suitable, but some are not very suitable.

    Indigenous Fertilizer is Different
    from Mixed Organic Fertilizer

    What is indigenous fertilizer? Current opinions are not consistent. In rural areas, organic mixed fertilizers made by farmers are often referred to as "indigenous fertilizers." We believe that indigenous fertilizer is a chemical fertilizer made by the masses using local materials and indigenous methods, which is the same as the significance of indigenous iron smelting. The characteristic of chemical fertilizer is that it has a strong and fast fertilizer effect and is easy to transport and apply. Therefore, the manufacture of indigenous fertilizer and the processing and improvement of organic fertilizer are different.

    At present, in addition to manure, urine, stable manure, and grass ash, farmers have widely used peat, river mud, pond mud, garbage, weeds, wall soil, kang bricks, soot, hair, fur, bones, and other materials. In some areas, by-products and wastes from factories, such as oil cakes, bittern, leather scraps, slag, waste smoke, waste acid, alum, lime, gypsum, and caustic soda, are also used. The masses not only make use of local materials and waste to broaden the sources of fertilizer but also try to refine organic fertilizer and prepare mixed fertilizer.

    The masses have carried out a lot of work and made great creations in the processing and improvement of organic fertilizer. For example, the decomposition of manure and urine, and the composting of manure have achieved great success; the "high-temperature rapid steaming fertilizer method" promoted in Lantian County, Shaanxi Province, and the "fire-temperature steam rapid composting method" in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, have greatly shortened the time for composting and the compost made by these methods is of good quality. At the same time, the masses also use green grass, garbage, or peat and manure to make dry compost (artificial manure); use weeds, leaves, stable manure, human urine, etc. mixed with ammonium sulfate and superphosphate of lime and a large amount of sewage to make artificial urine. In rural areas, bacterial fertilizers such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria, phosphorus bacteria, and antibiotic bacteria are also produced on a large scale. Indigenous bacterial fertilizer plants have also been widely established in rural areas.

    Organic-Inorganic Mixed Fertilizer Has Low Fertilizer Efficiency, and Problems are Easy to Occur in the Preparation of Inorganic-Organic Mixed Fertilizer

    Farm mixed fertilizers can be divided into four types: (1) Organic mixed fertilizer. (2) Inorganic mixed fertilizer. (3) Organic-inorganic mixed fertilizer. (4) Inorganic-organic mixed fertilizer. Organic mixed fertilizer is to mix various nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium organic fertilizers in rural areas to make a fertilizer with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. For example, in southern China, snails, shellfish, fish, shrimp, etc. are mixed with peat or soil fertilizer to form an organic fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium (in the manufacturing process, the hard shells or skeletons of animals should be crushed first to give full play to their role). Inorganic mixed fertilizer is to prepare various inorganic fertilizers into complete fertilizers, and most of the indigenous fertilizers belong to this category.

    Organic-inorganic mixed fertilizer is mainly organic fertilizer, mixed with a small amount of inorganic fertilizer, and chemical fertilizer or indigenous fertilizer can also be used. The general method of preparing this kind of fertilizer is to use peat, garbage, weeds, manure, river mud, and pond mud mixed with grass ash, soil nitrate, bone meal, or superphosphate of lime to make a mixed fertilizer that contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium and can be used as a base fertilizer. This kind of mixed fertilizer is the most common in rural areas. Except for some that affect crop growth due to the excessive use of table salt or bittern, the prepared finished products are generally usable. Organic-inorganic mixed fertilizer not only has the characteristics of combining nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium but also has the advantages of combining organic and inorganic and combining quick-acting and slow-acting. However, due to the different types of raw materials and formulas, the composition and content of the fertilizers produced are very inconsistent. According to the analysis results, the nitrogen content of general organic-inorganic mixed fertilizer is not very high, and some fertilizers also lack phosphorus or potassium. In the future, when preparing mixed fertilizer, it is best to determine the ratio of fertilizer according to the needs of the crop and the depth of fertilization. For example, for deep fertilization, slow-acting fertilizer mainly composed of phosphorus and potassium for later use by crops should be used, and bone meal or phosphate rock powder can be used to replace superphosphate of lime for phosphorus fertilizer; for shallow fertilization, quick-acting fertilizer mainly composed of nitrogen should be used.

    Inorganic-organic mixed fertilizer is mainly inorganic matter mixed with organic fertilizer. The preparation of this kind of fertilizer in rural areas has more problems. For example, using a large amount of alum, grass ash, lime, or alkali powder as the main material mixed with alum manure, urine, or bone meal, etc., not only makes the fertilizer too acidic or too alkaline but also causes the loss of fertilizer (organic nitrogen fertilizer will lose nitrogen when it encounters alkali).

    Do Not Add Too Much Acid or Alkali
    When Making Indigenous Fertilizer

    Indigenous fertilizer should be an inorganic fertilizer. In rural areas, nitrate, bones, grass ash, etc. are often used to make bone meal, bone water, nitrate cold, nitrate brine, alkali cold, alkali brine, etc., and then these things are mixed and stirred evenly, or boiled, or stir-fried, to produce fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. However, due to the different types of raw materials and formulas, the composition and content of the fertilizers produced are inconsistent. According to the analysis results of most specimens, the effective nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content of general indigenous fertilizers is not high. In the future, we should consider how to improve the effective components of the three elements of indigenous fertilizer. In the process of making indigenous fertilizer, often due to improper use of raw materials or unreasonable formulas, excessive waste acid, waste alkali, lime, caustic soda, alum, etc. are added, making the fertilizer too acidic or too alkaline, which directly affects the quality of the fertilizer and is harmful to crop growth. For example, if too much alum is used in the fertilizer, the acidity can be increased to 30% (the neutralization amount of calcium carbonate); if too much lime is added, the alkalinity can be as high as 30%-60% (calcium carbonate); adding caustic soda can increase the alkalinity to 65% (including sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate). It should be especially pointed out that some indigenous fertilizers in the south are too acidic, and some indigenous fertilizers in the north are too alkaline or contain too much harmful salt, which is inconsistent with the acidic soil in the south and the alkaline soil in the north. The preparation of fertilizer should be neutral, not too alkaline, not too acidic. In the preparation of fertilizer, some bad phenomena often occur due to the wrong use of raw materials or not understanding the chemical changes of fertilizer combination. For example, taking salt frost as nitrate soil, using table salt instead of nitrate, boiling human urine with lime or using human urine to wash grass ash, etc., should be corrected.

    Pay Attention to Acidity Problems
    When Extracting Ammonia

    In the manufacture of indigenous fertilizer, there is also a method of extracting ammonia from feces, animal remains, or industrial waste products and absorbing it into waste acid, ferrous sulfate, or chalk soil. The problem of excessive acidity is also often found in the manufacture of ammonium sulfate. In Xuzhou, Jiangsu, ammonium sulfate was extracted from sulfur mine slag, with a nitrogen content of about 13%, equivalent to 65% ammonium sulfate, but the acidity was too high; in Changshu, Jiangsu, ammonia was distilled from human urine and absorbed in sulfuric acid, and the ammonium sulfate produced was equivalent to 70%-90% ammonium sulfate, and the acidity was also too high. Excessive acidity not only affects the quality of the fertilizer but also is harmful to crop growth. In the future, the acidity should be checked at any time during the manufacturing process, and the effect of sulfuric acid absorbing ammonia should be fully utilized, and the fertilizer produced should be close to neutral.

    The problem of excessive acidity was also found in the treatment of bone meal or phosphate rock powder with sulfuric acid to produce superphosphate of lime. For example, the superphosphate of lime produced in Jiangyin, Jiangsu, contains up to 60% residual sulfuric acid.

    Alum is also often used in the production of indigenous fertilizer. Alum contains potassium sulfate and aluminum sulfate. Putting a large amount of aluminum into the soil has the disadvantage of fixing phosphate. It is best to recover the aluminum oxide, which can be used as a raw material for aluminum refining.

    In general, the current large-scale fertilizer accumulation and production campaign in rural areas has achieved great success, and timely scientific summary, analysis, and improvement should be carried out. In terms of fertilizer raw materials, in addition to collecting and excavating as much as possible in rural areas, factory waste materials such as slag, waste gas, and waste acid should be widely used to manufacture fertilizer. In addition, the knowledge of fertilizer efficacy and chemical properties should be vigorously popularized among the farmers to help them master the methods of identifying raw materials and fertilizers, so as to further promote the work of farmers in manufacturing fertilizers and enable them to play a huge role in the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    制造土化肥应注意的问题
    熊毅　陈家坊
    总结各地农业高额丰产的因素，除深翻土地外，施肥也是重大因素之一。
    大量施肥，就必先有量多质好的肥料。这一年来，在党的正确领导下，群众发挥了干劲和智慧，不仅在全国范围内展开了积肥运动，还掀起了改进肥料和大搞土化肥的高潮，在农业生产大跃进中发挥作用。最近中国科学院土壤研究所曾分析江苏、安徽等省的农家肥料四百六十件，中国科学院土壤队曾分析河北省和北京市郊区的农家肥料七十多件。经过鉴定结果，有很多合用的肥料，但也有一些是不大适用的。
    土化肥和混合
    有机肥有区别
    什么是土化肥？目前的意见还不一致，农村中常把农家所制的有机混合肥料也称为“土化肥”。我们认为土化肥是农民群众就地取材，用土法制成的化学肥料，这和土法炼铁的意义是一样的。化学肥料的特点是肥劲大而快，易于运输和施用，因此，土化肥的制造和有机肥料的加工改进是有所区别的。
    目前农家肥料除粪、尿、厩肥、草灰之外，已广泛应用泥炭、河泥、塘泥、垃圾、杂草、墙土、炕坯、烟灰、毛发、皮毛、骨头等物，个别地区还采用工厂副产品和废品如油饼、盐卤、皮革屑、矿渣、废烟、废酸、明矾、石灰、石膏、烧碱等。群众不仅就地取材和废物利用以广辟肥源，还设法精制有机肥料和配制混合肥料。
    群众对有机肥料的加工改进方面，展开不少工作，也有很大的创造。如粪、尿的腐熟，堆肥的堆制等都很有成就；陕西省蓝田县所推广的“高温速成蒸肥法”和云南省宜良县的“火温蒸汽快速堆肥法”等都大大缩短了堆肥腐熟的时间，并且用这种方法堆制的堆肥，质量也很好。同时，在群众中还有用青草、垃圾或泥炭和粪尿来制成干堆粪（人造粪）；用杂草、树叶、厩肥、人尿等拌上硫铵及过磷酸石灰调入大量污水制成人造尿等。在农村中，还大规模制造固氮菌、磷细菌和抗生菌等细菌肥料。土法细菌肥料厂在农村也普遍建立。
      有机无机混合肥肥效不高，无机有机混合肥配制易出问题
    农家的混合肥料可分为四种：（1）有机混合肥料。（2）无机混合肥料。（3）有机无机混合肥料。（4）无机有机混合肥料。有机混合肥料是把农村中各种氮、磷、钾有机肥料混合起来，使成为氮磷钾具备的肥料。如我国南方用螺丝、蚌壳、鱼虾等和泥炭或土肥一起混成氮、磷、钾、钙都有的有机肥料（在制造过程中，应先把动物的硬壳或骨格等粉碎，以便发挥其作用）。无机混合肥料是把各种无机肥料配制为全肥，大部分土化肥就属于这一类。
    有机无机混合肥料是以有机肥料为主，掺与少量的无机肥料，也可以用化肥或土化肥。一般配制这种肥料的办法是利用泥炭、垃圾、杂草、粪便、河泥和塘泥混入草灰、土硝、骨粉或过磷酸石灰，制成氮、磷、钾俱备而可作基肥用的混合肥料。农村中所配制的肥料以这种混合肥料最多，除部分因掺用过多食盐或盐卤影响作物生长之外，一般所配制的成品都大致可用。有机无机混合肥料不仅具有氮、磷、钾三要素相结合的特点，还具有有机和无机相结合和速效性与迟效性相结合的好处。但是由于原料的种类和配方不同，所制成肥料的成分和含量很不一致。根据分析结果，一般有机无机混合肥料的含氮量并不甚高，部分肥料中还有缺磷或缺钾的情况，今后配制混合肥料时，最好按作物的需要和施肥深度来决定肥料的配合比例。如深施肥，应以供作物后期利用的磷钾为主的迟效性肥料，磷肥可用骨粉或磷矿粉代替过磷酸石灰；浅施肥则应以氮素为主的速效性肥料为宜。
    无机有机混合肥料是以无机物为主掺入有机肥料。农村中配制的这种肥料，问题较大，例如用大量明矾、草木灰、石灰或碱粉为主料掺入矾粪尿或骨粉等物，不仅使所制肥料过酸或过碱，还引起肥料的损失（有机氮肥碰到碱、氮素要损失）。
  制土化肥不能加入
    过多的酸、碱
    土化肥应当是一种无机肥料。农村中常用硝盐、骨头、草木灰等来制成骨粉、骨水、硝冷子、硝卤水、碱冷子、碱卤水等，然后又把这些东西混合拌匀，或熬煮，或炒干，制出含有氮、磷、钾的肥料。但是由于原料的种类和配方不同，所制成肥料的成分和含量不一致。根据多数标本的分析结果，一般土化肥的有效氮、磷、钾含量都不高，今后应考虑如何提高土化肥的三要素有效成分。在制造土化肥的过程中，常因采用原料不当或配方不尽合理，加入过多的废酸、废碱、石灰、烧碱、明矾等而使肥料过酸或过碱，直接影响肥料的质量，对作物生长有损无益。如肥料中采用过多明矾，酸度可提高到30％（碳酸钙的中和量）；加入过多的石灰，碱度可高达30％—60％（碳酸钙）；加入烧碱可提高碱度到65％（包括碳酸钠及重碳酸钠）。特别要提出的，南方的土化肥有些酸性过大，北方的土化肥有些过于偏碱或含有过多的有害盐分，这和南方的酸性土壤和北方碱性土壤是相矛盾的。配制肥料时应宜求中性，不过碱，不过酸。在配制肥料时，常因错用原料或不了解肥料配合的化学变化，产生一些不好的现象。如把盐霜当硝土，以食盐代硝盐，人尿掺石灰熬煮或用人尿淋洗草木灰等，都应当加以纠正。
    提取氨要注意
    酸度过大问题
    在制造土化肥方面，还有从粪便，动物遗体或工业废品中提取氨并吸收于废酸、绿矾或白垩土的办法。在硫酸铵的制造过程中也常发现酸度过大的问题，江苏徐州曾由硫磺矿渣提取硫酸铵，含氮量约13％，相当于65％硫酸铵，但含酸度过高；江苏常熟由人尿蒸馏氨并吸收于硫酸中，所制出的硫酸铵，相当于70％—90％硫酸铵，酸度也是过大。酸度过大，不但影响肥料质量，而且有害于作物的生长。今后应在制造过程中随时检查其酸度，应充分利用硫酸吸氨的效力，并使所制肥料近于中性。
    用硫酸处理骨粉或磷矿粉以制造过磷酸石灰也发现酸度过大的问题，例如江苏江阴所制的过磷酸石灰，其中含有残余硫酸高达60％。
    在制土化肥中也常用明矾，明矾含有硫酸钾和硫酸铝，多量的铝放到土里有固定磷酸的害处，最好把氧化铝回收下来，可供炼铝原料之用。
    总的说来，目前农村大规模的开展积肥造肥运动，已经获得很大的成就，应及时进行科学总结，并分析和提高。在肥料的原料方面除在农村中尽量搜集和发掘外，应广泛利用工厂废料如矿渣废气废酸等来制造肥料。另外应在农民群众中大力普及肥料效能及化学性质的知识，帮助农民掌握鉴定原料和肥料的方法，这样更可推进农民制造肥料的工作，使其在农业生产大跃进中发挥巨大作用。
