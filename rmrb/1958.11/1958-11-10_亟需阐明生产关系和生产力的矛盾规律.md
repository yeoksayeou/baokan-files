    An Urgent Need to Clarify the Law of Contradiction Between Production Relations and Productive Forces
    Ai Siqi
    Regarding the issue of the contradiction between production relations and productive forces, there was a time when people often believed that the existence of this contradiction was merely the result of certain remnants of the old social system not yet being eliminated. As for the socialist production relations themselves, they seemed to be in complete accordance with the productive forces. Now, the practice of life has clearly raised the question: Socialist production relations themselves are also in contradiction with the development requirements of productive forces in many aspects.
    Up to now, socialist production relations still have the distinction between ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. Collective ownership is far superior to individual private ownership. However, the emergence of the people's commune has allowed us to begin to see that there is a contradiction between this form of ownership and ownership by the whole people. After the establishment of the people's communes, the rural productive forces developed even faster. One of the reasons is that after the cooperatives developed into people's communes, not only were many remnants of individual private ownership eliminated, but also certain factors of transformation from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people began to appear.
    The relationships between people in the socialist production process are usually regarded as comradely mutual aid and cooperation. This is certainly correct. However, it is not enough to merely point this out. The relationship between people in socialist production also has another aspect: here, there are still other essential differences between people: the differences between city and countryside, between workers and peasants, between mental and manual labor. The existence of these differences is in contradiction with the development of productive forces in socialist society.
    The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country clearly illustrates the existence of this contradiction. The rapid development of productive forces is inseparable from the beginning of breakthroughs in these differences.
    In socialist production relations, the exchange of labor between people is carried out according to the principle of equivalent exchange, according to the principle of "he who does not work, neither shall he eat" and remuneration according to labor. Such a form of distribution is inevitable and necessary in the production process. However, this right of equivalent exchange, according to which one obtains corresponding remuneration for the labor one provides, is still a bourgeois right. It is in contradiction with the further development requirements of socialist productive forces. This is because the role of this right lies only in relying on the stimulation of material interests to promote the production enthusiasm of the working people, rather than relying on raising their communist consciousness.
    The Great Leap Forward situation of the past year has made the contradiction between the distribution form of remuneration according to labor and the productive forces begin to be clearly exposed. Implementing a half-supply, half-wage system or abolishing piecework wages and adopting time wages has not fundamentally exceeded the nature of remuneration according to labor. However, these changes have indicated that our social practice has begun to move in the direction of gradually breaking through bourgeois rights, and factors of distribution according to need have begun to appear in our distribution system. And these changes are adapted to the above-mentioned changes in breaking through the distinction between the two forms of ownership and breaking through the differences between urban and rural areas, workers and peasants, and mental and manual labor.
    The law of contradiction between socialist production relations and productive forces is now exposed relatively clearly. We need to explain these laws more deeply and specifically.

    亟需阐明生产关系和生产力的矛盾规律
    艾思奇
    就生产关系和生产力的矛盾问题来说，曾经有一个时候，人们常常认为这种矛盾的存在仅只是由于旧社会制度的某些残余还没有消灭的结果，至于社会主义生产关系的本身，似乎是和生产力完全适合的。现在，生活的实践已经明确地提出了这样的问题：正是社会主义生产关系在许多方面也是和生产力的发展要求矛盾着的。
    社会主义的生产关系直到现在还存在着全民所有制和集体所有制的区别。集体所有制比个体私有制远为优越。但是人民公社的出现，已使我们开始看出这种所有制和全民所有制是有矛盾的。人民公社成立之后，农村的生产力发展得更快了。原因之一，就是合作社发展成为人民公社后，不但个人私有制的许多残余被消灭了，也开始出现了由集体所有制向全民所有制转化的某些因素。
    社会主义社会生产过程中人和人中间的相互关系，通常都认为是同志式的互助合作关系。这当然是不错的。但是，仅仅指出这一点来还是不够的。社会主义生产中人和人的关系还有它的另一个方面：在这里，人们之间还存在着其他的本质的差别：城市与乡村的差别，工人与农民的差别，脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别。这些差别的存在，和社会主义社会生产力的发展，是有着矛盾的。
    我国工农业生产的大跃进，清楚地说明了这个矛盾的存在。生产力的飞跃发展，和这些差别的开始突破是分不开的。
    在社会主义生产关系中，人和人之间劳动交换按照等价交换的原则，按照“不劳者不得食”和按劳付酬的原则来进行。这样的分配形式是不可避免的，也是生产过程上所必要的。但是，按照自己所供给的劳动来取得相应的报酬的这种等价交换权利，仍然是一种资产阶级式的法权。它和社会主义生产力的进一步发展要求是有矛盾的。因为，这种法权的作用仅仅是在于依靠物质利益的刺激来推动劳动人民的生产积极性，而不是依靠提高他们的共产主义觉悟。
    一年来的大跃进形势使按劳付酬的分配形式和生产力之间的矛盾开始明显地暴露出来。实行半供给半工资制或废除了计件工资而采用计时工资，在基本上仍然没有超出按劳付酬的性质。但是，这些变革已表示我们的社会实践已开始向着逐步突破资产阶级式法权的方向前进，开始在我们的分配制度中出现了各取所需的因素。而这些变革，是和上述突破两种所有制的区别和突破城乡、工农、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别的变革相适应的。
    社会主义社会生产关系和生产力的矛盾规律，现在已是暴露得比较明显了。我们要更深刻更具体地阐明这些规律。
