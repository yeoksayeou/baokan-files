Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 24th: According to the Polish Press Agency, Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, said at a workers' rally in Łódź on the 22nd that imperialist countries are not willing to ease international tensions in the slightest. They are betting on a military gamble to defeat socialism. "Under the current circumstances, the countries of the socialist camp should strengthen their unity and should be concerned about their own strength. The policies of our party and government are also following this direction."

Gomułka said that the friendly visit of the delegation of the Polish People's Republic to the Soviet Union made a great contribution to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, especially to strengthening the alliance and fraternal relations between Poland and the Soviet Union. "Those who try to undermine the foundations of our building and hope to weaken our country's relations with the Soviet Union are completely disappointed."

He said that we will never allow anyone to undermine the foundation of the People's Poland building. Our friendly visit to the Soviet Union has further consolidated this foundation. This fact is particularly important to us in the case of the atomic armament of the successors of Hitler's policies in West Germany. "If Hitler's followers do not stop their current aggressive policies, then they will only suffer complete defeat."

A grand rally was held at the Łódź Sports Palace on November 22 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Polish Textile Workers' Union. Gomułka made the above remarks in his speech at the meeting.

In his speech, Gomułka talked about the achievements of the Polish national economy in the years of the people's regime. He said that anyone who can observe socialism and compare it with capitalism can now clearly see the advantages and superiority of socialism.

Gomułka said that although socialist countries currently have less production and consumption per capita than the most developed capitalist countries, this distance between the two sides is constantly and rapidly narrowing every year, and will be narrowed even faster in the near future.

The economic development of socialist countries is accelerating day by day. Just look at the draft outline of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy, and you will surely be convinced of this. The development plans of other socialist countries, especially the unprecedented development of the Chinese economy, also show how quickly the distance between socialist countries and the most developed capitalist countries in terms of production will be rapidly shortened until it is completely eliminated.

Gomułka pointed out that imperialist countries are unwilling to ease international tensions in the slightest and are unwilling to reduce their armaments in the slightest. This is because this would reduce the profits of capitalist monopoly capital, accelerate the development of socialism, and create better conditions for the socialist system to compete with the capitalist system. In addition, they are unwilling to do so because they know that the result of this competition will inevitably be that socialism will win in a very short historical period, and therefore, they are betting on a military gamble to defeat socialism.

Gomułka said that the socialist camp countries certainly cannot take a passive attitude towards the military activities of imperialist aggressive groups, and they have not taken a passive attitude. He said: "The military and political strength of the socialist countries and all the peaceful forces in the world are the backing of the socialist countries' peaceful policies."

In his speech, Gomułka also talked about the role of trade unions in People's Poland. He said that under the socialist system, the role of trade unions has undergone a fundamental change because trade unions have become an integral part of the socialist system. The trade union is a very important tool in the hands of the working class, and it is a tool for the working class to exert their role as masters in public enterprises.

Gomułka said that for fourteen years, the Polish socialist revolution has been developing continuously. The driving force of the socialist revolution is the working class, and the leading force of this revolution is the working class party—the Polish United Workers' Party. He said that our economy, our national economy, and first of all our industry, is the foundation of the entire social revolutionary change. I think the most important and revolutionary task is to exert all our strength and mobilize the maximum material resources to further develop our industry, increase production, reduce production costs, and increase labor productivity.

Gomułka finally said that workers and laborers have stepped onto the historical stage as a factor determining the direction of historical development. This direction is socialism. Socialism is the future of the world.

    哥穆尔卡说帝国主义丝毫不愿缓和国际紧张局势
    社会主义阵营应当加强团结和力量
    新华社华沙24日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡22日在罗兹市的一个工人集会上说，帝国主义国家丝毫不愿意缓和国际紧张局势。它们把战胜社会主义的希望押在军事赌注上。“在目前情况下，社会主义阵营国家应当加强自己的团结，应当关心自己的力量。我们的党和政府的政策也正是遵循着这个方针的”。
    哥穆尔卡说，波兰人民共和国代表团到苏联的友好访问，对于加强社会主义阵营的团结，特别是对于加强波兰和苏联的联盟和兄弟关系，作出了巨大的贡献。“那些企图拆我们大厦的墙脚并指望削弱我国同苏联的关系的人，是完全失望了”。
    他说，我们决不让任何人破坏人民波兰大厦的立足基础。我们到苏联的友好访问，更加巩固了这个基础。在西德的希特勒政策继承者进行原子武装的情况下，这个事实对我们特别重要。“如果希特勒的追随者不停止自己目前的侵略政策，那末，他们就只会遭到彻底的失败。”
    11月22日罗兹市体育宫举行了盛大集会，庆祝波兰纺织工人工会成立五十周年。哥穆尔卡是在会上讲话时说了以上那番话的。
    哥穆尔卡在讲话中谈到了波兰国民经济在人民政权年代中所获得的成就。他说，任何人，只要他能观察一下社会主义并把它同资本主义作一比较，那么，他现在就能够明显地看得出社会主义的优势和优越性。
    哥穆尔卡说，社会主义国家目前在按人口平均计算的生产和消费方面虽然还比最发达的资本主义国家少，但是，双方之间的这种距离每年都在不断地迅速缩小，在最近的将来，还要更快地缩小。
    社会主义国家的经济发展速度日益加快。只要看一看苏联发展国民经济七年计划提纲草案，就一定会对这一点深信不疑。其他社会主义国家的发展计划，特别是中国经济的空前未有的发展也同样表明，社会主义国家同最发达的资本主义国家在生产方面的距离将会以何等快的速度迅速缩短，直至完全消除。
    哥穆尔卡指出，帝国主义国家丝毫不愿意缓和国际紧张局势，丝毫不愿意裁减自己的军备。这是因为，这会减少资本主义垄断资本的利润，会加速社会主义的发展，会为社会主义制度创造出同资本主义制度竞赛的更好的条件。此外，他们不愿意这样做，还因为他们知道，这种竞赛的结果必然是社会主义将在很短的历史时期内取得胜利，因而，他们就把战胜社会主义的希望押在军事赌注上。
    哥穆尔卡说，社会主义阵营国家对帝国主义侵略集团的军事活动当然不能采取被动态度，而且也没有采取被动态度。他说：“社会主义国家的军事和政治力量，全世界的一切和平力量，都是社会主义国家和平政策的后盾”。
    哥穆尔卡在讲话中还谈到了工会在人民波兰中的作用。他说，在社会主义制度下，工会的作用起了根本的变化，因为工会已成为社会主义制度的一个组成部分。工会是工人阶级手中的一个非常重要的工具，是工人阶级发挥他们在公有化企业中主人翁作用的一个工具。
    哥穆尔卡说，十四年来，波兰社会主义革命一直在不断发展。社会主义革命的推动力是工人阶级，这个革命的领导力量是工人阶级的政党——波兰统一工人党。他说，我国的经济，我国的国民经济，首先是我国的工业，是整个社会革命变革的基础。我认为，最重要的、最具有革命性的任务，就是要鼓足全力，动员最大限度的物力，来进一步发展我国的工业，提高产量，降低生产成本和提高劳动生产率。
    哥穆尔卡最后说，工人、劳动者已作为决定历史发展方向的因素而走上了历史舞台。这个方向就是社会主义。社会主义是全世界的未来。
