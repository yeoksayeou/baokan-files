    Better Use of Debate Methods
    Zhai Xiangdong
    Fully promoting democracy and initiating mass airing of views and debates whenever issues arise is the correct method for handling contradictions among the people. Airing views and debating can allow the masses to educate themselves, improve their understanding, and thoroughly resolve ideological problems; at the same time, leaders can understand the ideological trends of the people, absorb correct opinions from the masses, and continuously improve their work. In the past year or so, more and more people have recognized the importance of debate and learned how to organize debates. "Debate whatever we do," "big debates for big issues, small debates for small issues," "debate if there's no consensus, then act once there is consensus" have become common phenomena. Some people even proactively raise issues, request debates, or conduct self-debates to distinguish right from wrong and discuss merits and demerits: this is a welcome phenomenon in the development of socialist democracy.
    The Great Leap Forward and the communization movement have brought many new issues to the forefront for leaders and the masses, and many new contradictions have emerged among the people, urgently requiring adjustment. In this situation, it is even more important to fully promote democracy and consult with the masses on everything. Therefore, paying attention to organizing mass debates in our work cannot be ignored. Many people understand this point, and despite the intense production and work schedules, they still pay attention to initiating mass debates at any time and regard debate as one of the fundamental methods for completing tasks. In the current communist education movement, many places are universally guiding the masses to engage in debates on issues such as "Why establish communes? How to run communes well?" "Is it good to implement a half-supply, half-wage system?" "Who are we fighting hard for?" In the debates, the masses' communist ideas are overflowing, and they boldly raise many new contradictions that urgently need to be resolved after communization, awakening the leadership and assisting the leadership in resolving them. This is a clear sign of the development of airing views and debating to a new stage.
    Some people feel that "there is really no need to always launch mass airing of views and debates." This understanding does not grasp that in the face of the new situation of the rapid advancement of socialist construction, on the one hand, the leadership is unfamiliar with many new things and lacks experience with many new problems, urgently needing to study and explore the way forward together with the masses; on the other hand, many people in the masses have different opinions on many new things and new problems, and are equally unfamiliar; and there is a need to promptly organize debates to achieve a correct understanding. If the masses do not debate many new and important issues and unify their understanding through debate, there will be no unified language and unified action, which will be detrimental to adjusting contradictions among the people and establishing production and social changes on a solid foundation of high consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses.
    Strictly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions: those between ourselves and the enemy, and those among the people.
    Some places have adopted methods of attack and struggle in carrying out debates. It is certainly correct to promptly attack and struggle against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who still exist and dare to undermine the communization movement and the Great Leap Forward movement. Especially when we are adjusting new contradictions among the people, we should resolutely counterattack those enemies who dare to take the opportunity to sabotage. However, after all, this type of issue is a small amount at present. The large amount that exists are issues among the people. If we adopt methods of dealing with contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, implementing attack and struggle, when debating issues among the people, then it is obviously a principled mistake. Some people in the masses now have misconceptions about debate because some comrades have confused the two different types of debate, and have also adopted methods of dealing with contradictions between ourselves and the enemy for debates on issues among the people.
    The two different types of debate are determined by the two different types of contradictions: those between ourselves and the enemy, and those among the people. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists spread dissatisfaction with the current great changes, or deliberately exaggerate the shortcomings in our work, and even fabricate rumors. Their purpose is to oppose communization, undermine the Great Leap Forward, and want our society to stop moving forward, or even go backward, in order to benefit their resurgence. We must refute and struggle against their destructive remarks. Sometimes, we also adopt the method of debate to handle contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, but the purpose of the debate is to expose the enemy, isolate the enemy, and attack the enemy. Therefore, it is still a struggle against the enemy. As for the people, some people either air some wrong opinions, or reveal some dissatisfaction with the current changes, and some even have extremely wrong remarks, but they are either due to temporary lack of understanding, or have opinions on some shortcomings in the development of work, but their purpose is not to oppose communization and undermine the Great Leap Forward, and some even urgently hope to run the commune better and make production leap forward faster. Using the method of debate to resolve this type of contradiction can only be based on presenting the facts, reasoning, and patiently persuading and educating. Sometimes, we also conduct ideological struggle against those who have serious wrong ideas, but it is limited to reasoning, and the purpose of this struggle is still to educate and persuade, so as to achieve unity. Therefore, in order to have a good debate and accurately resolve the problem, we must not only look at the phenomenon, but must analyze from the essence, first strictly distinguish between the two different natures of the contradiction, and then determine the method of debate according to the nature of the contradiction. We must strictly distinguish between these two different natures of issues in the purpose and method of debate. The purpose of using the method of debate to discuss issues among the people is to correctly resolve contradictions among the people, unite the masses, and mobilize all positive factors for building socialism. If we misuse the method of dealing with contradictions between ourselves and the enemy to handle contradictions among the people, and confuse debate with attack, it will inevitably expand and deepen contradictions among the people, seriously detach ourselves from the masses, and turn good things into bad things.
    Analyze contradictions among the people too
    At present, the issues for debate are largely issues among the people. If we do not analyze issues among the people, and simply regard all contradictions among the people as contradictions between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, the two ideologies, or conversely, simply regard them all as contradictions between advanced and backward, we will not be able to effectively resolve the contradictions, and we will also detach ourselves from the masses.
    Among the contradictions among the people, the contradiction between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, the two ideologies, is the most important contradiction at present, and will continue to exist for a long time to come, not only now. We cannot have any ambiguity about this. For example, in the process of people's communization, some wealthy middle peasants have residual capitalist spontaneous tendencies, are nostalgic for capitalism, and do not want to move forward. They stand on a strong position of individualism and departmentalism, conceal and privately divide public property, express dissatisfaction with the collectivization of livestock and trees after communization, and oppose the half-supply, half-wage system, etc. Many debates in the countryside are precisely the struggle between the socialist direction and the residual capitalist spontaneous tendencies of these wealthy middle peasants. Some comrades do not see this contradiction, or stand on the position of capitalist spontaneous tendencies, agree with various arguments that are actually nostalgic for private ownership, and show political right-leaning. This is an aspect that deserves attention.
    On the other hand, some comrades have ignored the contradiction between advanced thinking and backward thinking among people who support socialism and communism. Many people with backward thinking doubt that communization is "rash advance," worry that the commune is too big and cannot be run well, and so on. Such ideas should not be regarded as capitalist ideas, wanting to take the capitalist road. The contradiction between advanced thinking and conservative backward thinking is sometimes related to the contradiction between the two roads and the two ideologies, and it is not easy to distinguish at once. However, one is the difference between the two roads, and the other is consistent agreement with the socialist and communist road, but the thinking is different in terms of advanced and conservative backwardness, after all, they are not issues of the same nature. Therefore, they cannot be confused. If they are confused, it will inevitably hurt the enthusiasm of some of the masses, or even cause them to have misconceptions about the Party's policies and cause dissatisfaction.
    After communization, because the leadership has to organize the masses' production and also organize the masses' lives, if it is not handled well, the contradiction between the leadership and the masses may also be more prominent. This contradiction is, on the one hand, because the leadership lacks experience in some new issues after communization, and the solutions are not appropriate or timely, and on the other hand, some cadres have developed a compulsory command style, do not care about the masses' rest and life, and handle problems simply and bluntly. Sometimes it is the shortcomings of the leadership, but instead they criticize the masses, and the masses therefore have opinions.
    Among the people, there are also other contradictions. In short, contradictions among the people are complex and must be analyzed specifically. Some comrades feel that work is tense, and seriously analyzing these contradictions is "too troublesome." This thinking should be reversed. Otherwise, it will lead to wrong debates, unclear rights and wrongs, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, affecting the improvement of work, and then it will become a really troublesome thing.
    Democracy and reasoning are the soul of debate
    Fully promoting democracy, fully reasoning, and convincing people with reason are the souls of carrying out debates among the people and making debates truly able to solve problems. Some of the masses have misconceptions about debate, which is greatly related to the fact that some cadres regard debate as a tool of compulsory command, and the debate methods are simple and blunt. The main manifestations of simplicity and bluntness are: 1. Against people rather than against things. The saying "lightly criticize, heavily debate" does not start from clarifying the nature of the problem, but contains the meaning of attacking a few people. 2. One-sided debate rather than two-sided debate, without presenting facts and reasoning, only the majority criticizing and scolding the minority; the minority party has almost no opportunity to talk about their own reasons, let alone insist on their own opinions. 3. Requiring the debate to solve the problem at once, without doing some work outside the debate, and not listening to the reasonable opinions of the opposing side.
    Debate is a kind of ideological movement, and ideological activities can be hidden or visible. To truly solve the problem and not produce false appearances, when debating issues among the people, we must create all conditions, inspire controversy between the opposing sides, emphasize against things rather than against people, and should not create a political pressure on a certain person. Emphasize "what is discussed is the matter, what is debated is the reason," and the debate meeting should become a meeting for "finding the truth." If a debate does not succeed, then debate many times, do not be so nervous. Whether it is leading cadres or the masses, they must fully reason, and must obey the truth. Whoever's reason is right, obey whoever's reason.
    To make the debate truly able to carry out in this way, the key is for the leading cadres to establish a democratic style and listen to the opinions of the masses. Because the leadership shoulders the heavy responsibility of organizing the masses' production and organizing the masses' lives after communization, and many new contradictions have emerged at present that need to be adjusted, the leadership should consciously and actively mobilize the masses to conduct airing of views and debates on relevant issues, expose problems, and discuss solutions with the masses. In particular, pay attention to mobilizing the masses to open up their minds, debate some problems in the leadership's work, and listen to the criticisms and suggestions of the masses. After communization, it is inevitable that some of the masses have some opinions on the leadership, and the opinions of the masses are not all wrong, nor do they all belong to negative complaints. It should be said that constructive opinions account for the majority. Therefore, be sure not to "immediately push back as soon as someone speaks up," and do not make the masses with opinions feel that they are "being debated." By fully promoting democracy in this way, being good at mobilizing the masses to air their views, flexibly organizing mass debates, adopting reasonable opinions, and correcting wrong opinions with reason, we can mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, which will greatly help adjust new contradictions among the people, thereby accelerating the cause of socialist construction.

    更好地运用辩论的方法
    翟向东
    充分发扬民主，遇事发动群众鸣放辩论，是处理人民内部矛盾的正确方法。有事鸣放辩论，可以由群众自己教育自己，提高认识，把思想问题解决透；同时，领导上也可以了解人们的思想动向，从群众中吸收正确的意见，不断地改进工作。近一年多来，越来越多的人认识了辩论的重要，学会了组织辩论的方法，“做啥辩啥”，“大事大辩，小事小辩”，“不通就辩，通了就干”，已成为普遍的现象。有些群众甚而时常主动地提出问题，要求辩论，或自行辩论，分是非，议好坏：这更是社会主义民主发展中的可喜现象。
    生产大跃进和公社化运动，把许多新问题提到领导和群众面前，人民内部出现了许多新的矛盾，急需加以调整。在这种情况下，更充分地发扬民主，遇事与群众商量，就更为重要。因之，在工作中注意组织群众辩论，也就更不可忽视。许多人理解了这一点，尽管生产和工作十分紧张，仍然随时注意发动群众辩论，并且把辩论当成完成任务的根本方法之一。在当前的共产主义教育运动中，许多地方普遍就“为什么办公社？怎样办好公社？”“实行半供给半工资制好不好？”“苦战究竟为了谁？”等问题，引导群众展开了辩论。在辩论中，群众的共产主义思想洋溢，大胆地提出了公社化后许多迫切需要解决的新的矛盾，唤醒领导上并协助领导上去解决，这是鸣放辩论发展到新的阶段的鲜明标志。
    有些人觉得，“总是发动群众鸣放辩论，实在没有必要”。这种认识，是不了解在社会主义建设事业飞速前进的新形势面前，一方面，领导上对许多新事物是生疏的，对许多新问题缺乏经验，急待与群众一起研究，摸索前进；另一方面，群众中有许多人，对许多新事物、新问题，其说不一，同样很生疏；而需要及时地组织辩论来取得正确的认识。如果群众对许多新的重要问题不加辩论，并从辩论中统一认识，就将没有统一的语言和统一的行动，这就不利于调整人民内部矛盾，使生产变革和社会变革建立在群众的高度自觉性、积极性的坚实基础上。
    严格区别敌我之间和人民内部两种不同的矛盾
    有的地方在开展辩论中，采用了打击、斗争的方法。对目前仍然存在着的敌我矛盾，对于那些敢于破坏公社化运动和生产大跃进运动的地、富、反、坏、右及时给以打击、斗争，当然是正确的。特别是当我们调整人民内部新的矛盾的时候，我们对那些敢于乘机破坏的敌人更应该给以坚决的反击。但这类性质的问题，在当前毕竟是小量的。大量存在的是人民内部的问题。在辩论人民内部问题时如果采用对待敌我矛盾的方法，实行打击、斗争，则显然是原则的错误。群众中有些人现在对辩论有错觉，原因就是有些同志混淆了两种不同的辩论，对人民内部问题的辩论也采用了对待敌我矛盾的方法。
    两种不同的辩论，是由敌我之间和人民内部两种不同的矛盾决定的。地、富、反、坏、右对当前的大变革散布不满，或故意夸大我们工作中的缺点，甚至造谣生事，他们的目的是在于反对公社化，破坏大跃进，想让我们的社会停止不前，甚至往回里走，以利于他们死灰复燃。对他们所散布的破坏言论，我们一定要驳斥，要进行斗争。有时，我们处理敌我矛盾，也采取辩论的方法，但是辩论的目的，是为了揭露敌人，孤立敌人，打击敌人。因此仍是同敌人进行斗争。至于人民内部，有些人或者鸣放了某些错误意见，或者流露了对当前变革的某些不满，有的甚至有极其错误的言论，但是他们或者是由于一时认识不清，或者是对工作发展中的某些缺点有意见，他们的目的却并不是反对公社化和破坏大跃进，有的还是迫切希望把公社办的更好，使生产跃进的更快。用辩论的方法解决这类矛盾，只能是摆事实、讲道理、耐心地说服教育。有时，我们对那些有严重的错误思想的人，也进行思想斗争，但只限于说理，这种斗争的目的，同样仍是为了教育说服，达到团结。因此，为了辩论的好，问题解决的准，就不能只从现象上看，而必须从本质上去分析，首先严格区分两种不同性质的矛盾，然后根据矛盾的性质，确定辩论的方式方法。对这两种不同性质的问题，必须在辩论的目的和方法上严格地区别开来。我们用辩论方法讨论人民内部问题，目的是在于正确解决人民内部矛盾，团结群众，调动建设社会主义的一切积极因素。如果错用对待敌我矛盾的方法来处理人民内部矛盾，把辩论与打击混淆了，必将扩大和加深人民内部的矛盾，严重脱离群众，把好事变成坏事。
    人民内部矛盾也要分析
    目前辩论的问题，大量的是人民内部问题，如果对人民内部问题不加分析，简单化地把人民内部矛盾统统看成是社会主义与资本主义两条道路、两种思想的矛盾，或相反地统统看成先进与落后的矛盾，就不能有效地解决矛盾，而且也会脱离群众。
    在人民内部矛盾中，资本主义和社会主义两条道路、两种思想的矛盾，是目前最主要的矛盾，并且不仅现在存在，在今后很长时期内仍将继续存在。对此，我们不能有半点模糊。如在人民公社化的过程中，就有一部分富裕中农，残存着资本主义自发倾向，留恋资本主义，不想前进。他们站在浓厚的个人主义、本位主义立场，隐瞒、私分公共财产，对公社化后家畜、树木的入社表示不满，反对半供给半工资制等。农村中的许多辩论，正是社会主义方向与这种富裕中农残存的资本主义自发倾向的斗争。有些同志看不到这种矛盾，或者站在资本主义自发倾向的立场上，赞同各种实际上是留恋私有制的论调，表现了政治上的右倾。这是值得注意的一个方面。
    另一方面，有些同志忽视了在拥护社会主义、共产主义的人们中间，还有着先进思想与落后思想的矛盾。许多有落后思想的人，怀疑公社化是“冒进”，担心社太大了办不好，等等。对这样一些思想，不可一律认为是资本主义思想，是想走资本主义道路。先进思想与保守落后思想有时与两条道路、两种思想的矛盾有联系，一下子不好分清。但一个是两条道路的不同，一个是一致赞同社会主义、共产主义道路，而思想有先进、保守落后之不同，毕竟不是同一性质的问题。因此不能混为一谈。如果混淆了，必定会伤害一部分群众的积极性，甚或使他们对党的政策产生错觉，引起不满。
    公社化以后，因为领导上既要组织群众生产，又要组织群众的生活，如果处理不好，领导与群众之间的矛盾也就可能表现得较为突出。这种矛盾，一种是因为领导上对公社化后一些新的问题缺乏经验，解决的不妥当，不及时，一种是部分干部滋长了强迫命令作风，不关心群众的休息和生活，处理问题简单生硬。也有时是领导上的缺点，反而去批评群众，群众因而有意见。
    在人民内部，也还有其他矛盾。总之，人民内部矛盾是复杂的，必须进行具体分析。有些同志觉得工作紧张，认真分析这些矛盾“太麻烦”。这种思想应当扭转。不然，就会招致错误的辩论，是非不清，引起群众不满，影响工作的改进，那样，就成了真正麻烦的事情。
    民主与说理是辩论的灵魂
    充分发扬民主，充分说理，以理服人，是人民内部开展辩论，并使辩论真正能解决问题的灵魂。有些群众对辩论有错觉，这与有些干部把辩论当作强迫命令的一种工具，在辩论方法上简单生硬有很大关系。简单生硬的表现主要是：一、对人而不是对事。“轻者批评，重者辩论”的说法，就是不从辩清问题性质出发，而含有打击少数人之意。二、一面辩而不是两面辩，不摆事实讲道理，只由多数人对少数人批评训斥；少数的一方几乎没有机会讲自己的道理，更不用说坚持自己的意见了。三、要求辩论一次就解决问题，不在辩论会外做些工作，不听取对立面的合理的意见。
    辩论是一种思想运动，思想活动是可隐可现的，要真能解决问题，不产生假象，在辩论人民内部的问题时，必须创造一切条件，启发对立面之间的争论，强调对事而不对人，不应造成对某一个人的一种政治压力。强调“论的是事，辩的是理”，辩论会要成为“找真理”的会，一次辩论不成，就多次辩论，不必那么紧张。不论领导干部或群众，都要充分说理，而又要服从真理，谁的道理对服从谁。
    要使辩论真正能这样开展起来，关键在于领导干部树立民主作风，倾听群众的意见。由于公社化后领导上担起了组织群众生产和组织群众生活的重担，当前又出现许多新的矛盾需要调整，领导上更应自觉地积极地发动群众，就有关问题进行鸣放辩论，暴露问题，与群众共同商量解决。尤其要注意发动群众敞开思想，辩论领导工作中的一些问题，听取群众的批评建议。公社化后，某些群众对领导有些意见，是免不了的，群众的意见并不都是错误的，也并不都属于消极瞒怨，应当说建设性的意见占大部分。因此，一定不要“一出头就顶回去”，也不要使有意见的群众感到是“挨辩论”。这样充分发扬民主，善于发动群众鸣放，灵活地组织群众辩论，采纳合理的意见，对错误意见又能加以纠正，以理服人，才可以调动起群众的积极性，大大有利于调整人民内部新的矛盾，从而加速社会主义建设事业。
