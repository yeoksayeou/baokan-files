Clearing Ideological Obstacles and Adapting to Construction Needs
Taiyuan Factories and Mines Run Schools Everywhere

(Our Dispatch) Reporter Feng Jianwei reports: After factories and mines in Taiyuan City universally established schools, they are gradually moving towards consolidation and improvement. Some factories and mines that have done a better job have also created good experiences in schools run and taught by the masses, pushing factory and mine-run schools to a new stage.

The factory and mine-run schools in Taiyuan City are characterized by close integration with actual production and a variety of forms. Currently, all larger factories and mines in the city have established spare-time and part-work, part-study schools, each with a fairly complete educational system from primary school to university. According to recent statistics from eighty-nine state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines, the first type, spare-time schools, is the most common and major form. The second type of school is still being piloted. The above two types of schools have a total of more than 132,000 students, accounting for more than 72% of the total number of employees.

Factories and mines in Taiyuan City began running schools in May. In the early stages of establishment, they first encountered a series of ideological obstacles. Some leading cadres of factories and mines mechanically opposed study and production, believing that running schools in factories and mines was not attending to their proper duties and would inevitably affect production; others, although they felt the necessity of running schools, still believed that a distant supply could not quench the immediate thirst and held a passive and hesitant attitude. After the schools were opened, some cadres and staff with higher levels of education also had formalistic ideas, pursuing bigness, foreignness, and high standards, looking down on the existing schools and teachers. In order to thoroughly solve these ideological problems, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held two meetings of factory and mine party committee secretaries and propaganda officers in May and July, respectively, adopting the method of moving from practical matters to theoretical principles, debating while acting, and carrying out serious criticism of erroneous ideas. The Municipal Committee particularly emphasized the need to consult with the masses and follow the mass line. In addition, each factory had to calculate the current and future needs for technical personnel. Many responsible cadres of factories and mines initially could not understand, but after consulting with the workers, the workers said that mechanization and electrification were difficult to achieve without culture; however, they had no opportunity to study culture during pre-shift and post-shift meetings, and therefore requested schools and opportunities to study. Some factories calculated the need to supplement new technical personnel for production development and were shocked, realizing that there was a shortage now and would be a greater shortage in the future. If they did not start cultivating these talents early, they would become increasingly passive and affect production. After the ideological problems were resolved, the enthusiasm for running schools increased, and each factory shifted from passive to active, and various forms of schools developed like a rising tide in the factories and mines.

In the process of establishing schools, factories and mines generally encountered the contradiction between tense production labor and learning time. Regarding this contradiction, each factory and mine school adopted flexible and diverse methods based on different production conditions. The labor and production time arrangements for part-work, part-study students were sometimes based on the "four-four system," that is, four hours of labor and four hours of study each day. The workshop would pre-assign apprentices or technicians to the enrolled workers, so that the remaining work after they studied would be done by the apprentices, so as not to interrupt production. The workshop labor shortage was made up by mobilizing cadres to work or organizing family members to produce. Some implemented the "every other day six-two system," studying six hours per week, so that the labor organization was not greatly affected and the income of the employees was not reduced. Others implemented a four-shift system, working eight hours a day, three days of work and one day of study. Still others implemented a three-shift rotation system, that is, two shifts working each day, each shift working twelve hours, and one shift studying, rotating every three days or two weeks. This ensures both production time and concentrated and extended study time.

The Mining Machinery Factory and Jinxi Machinery Factory recently tested the three-level school system of factory level, workshop and work area. This not only promoted the enthusiasm of lower-level organizations for running schools, facilitated the resolution of problems such as learning time, lack of classrooms and teachers, but also made teaching more closely integrated with actual production.

### 扫清思想障碍　适应建设需要  太原厂矿办学遍地开花

    扫清思想障碍　适应建设需要
    太原厂矿办学遍地开花
    本报讯　记者冯建伟报道：太原市各厂矿普遍举办学校以后，正逐步走向巩固和提高。有些办理较好的厂矿，还创造了群众办群众教的好经验，把厂矿办学推向一个新的阶段。
    太原市的厂矿办学，以紧密结合生产实际和形式多种多样为显著特点。全市较大厂矿目前都已办了业余的、半工半读的学校，每一种都有从小学、中学到大学的教育体系，组织相当完备。据最近八十九个国营和地方国营厂矿的统计，第一类业余学校，是目前大量的主要的形式。第二类学校目前还在试办。以上两种学校，共有学生十三万两千多人，占职工总数的72％多。
    太原市各厂矿办学是从5月开始的。在创办初期，首先遇到一系列的思想障碍。有些厂矿领导干部把学习和生产机械地对立起来，认为厂矿办学校是不务正业，势必影响生产；有的虽然感到办学的必要，但还认为远水不解近渴，抱消极犹豫的态度。开办学校后，还有些文化较高的干部和职员存在正规化思想，追求大、洋、高，看不起现有的学校，瞧不起教员。为了彻底解决这些思想问题，中共太原市委在5月和7月，分别召开两次厂矿党委书记和宣传负责干部的会议，采取从实务虚，边辩论边行动的办法，对错误思想开展严肃批判。市委特别强调要和群众商量，要走群众路线，另外还要各厂算清目前和今后需要技术力量的账。许多厂矿负责干部开始想不通，回厂和工人一商量，工人说，机械化电气化，没有文化很难化。而现在却是班前会，班后会，学习文化没机会；要求办学，要求学习。有的厂计算了生产发展需要补充新的技术力量后，大吃一惊：感到现在缺，将来还缺，如不及早动手培养，就越来越被动，越来越影响生产。思想问题解决后，办学积极性随着提高，各厂都由被动转为主动，各种形式的学校便在厂矿里风起云涌般发展起来。
    在创办学校的过程中，各厂矿普遍遇到紧张的生产劳动和学习时间的矛盾。对于这个矛盾，各厂矿学校都根据不同的生产情况，采取灵活多样的办法。半工半读学生的劳动和生产时间安排，有的采取“四四制”，即每天四小时劳动四小时学习。车间要预先给入学职工配好徒工或技工，使他学习时剩下的活由徒工来干，不致间断生产。车间劳动力缺额，由厂内发动干部劳动或组织家属生产来补足。有的实行“隔日六二制”，每周学习六小时，这样劳动组织不受大影响，职工收入也不减少。还有的实行四班制，每天工作八小时，三天工作一天学习。有的是三班大轮换，即每天有两班工作，每班劳动十二小时，一班学习，每三天或两星期对换一次。这样既能保证生产时间，又使学习时间集中和延长。
    矿山机器厂和晋西机器厂，最近试验厂级、车间和工区三级办学。这样，不仅发扬了下层组织的办学积极性，便利解决学习时间、缺乏教室和教员等问题，而且使教学更加结合生产实际。
