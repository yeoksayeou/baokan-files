Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 26th: A grand mass rally of Sofia citizens was held this afternoon to warmly welcome the Czechoslovak Party and Government delegation headed by Novotny, which is currently visiting Bulgaria. Novotny and Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they unanimously emphasized that the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is a garden full of spring, while the imperialist camp is a scene of desolation.

    Novotny said: "The world has now developed to a new stage. The characteristic of this stage is: the increasingly great achievements of socialism and its decisive victory in the peaceful competition with capitalism. The people of the whole world are watching with great joy the continuous consolidation of the socialist camp and its catching up with, and even surpassing, capitalist countries in many aspects of economy, science and culture."

    Zhivkov said: "Now, the balance of power in the world has developed to such a point that neither the intimidation and blackmail of the imperialists, nor the slander of modern revisionists, can stop the further strengthening of the unity and power of the socialist camp. In the peaceful competition with capitalism, the socialist system will inevitably triumph."

    In their speeches, Novotny and Zhivkov both emphasized the eternal friendship between the Bulgarian and Czechoslovak people, the importance of the friendship between the two peoples and the Soviet Union, and the unwavering will to continuously strengthen this friendship.

    The mass rally was held in "September 9th Square". When Novotny, Siroky and others, accompanied by Bulgarian Party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov and others, appeared on the rostrum, warm applause resounded throughout the venue.

    That evening, Czechoslovak Ambassador to Bulgaria, Spurny, held a grand banquet at the Balkan Hotel for the visit of the Czechoslovak Party and Government delegation to Bulgaria. Bulgarian Party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov and others attended the banquet.

    On the evening of the 25th, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly, R. Damyanov, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Yugov, hosted a banquet in the Hall of the Council of Ministers to welcome the delegation. Novotny and Siroky paid a return visit to Damyanov this morning, and the guests had a cordial conversation.

    捷保领导人在索非亚群众大会上指出
    和平竞赛社会主义制度必胜
    新华社索非亚26日电　索非亚市民今天下午举行盛大的保捷友谊群众大会，热烈欢迎正在保加利亚访问的以诺沃提尼为首的捷克斯洛伐克党和政府代表团。诺沃提尼和保共中央第一书记日夫科夫先后在会上讲了话。他们在讲话中一致强调指出，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营正是满园春色，而帝国主义阵营却是满目凄凉。

    日夫科夫说：“现在，世界力量的对比已发展到这样一种情况：不论是帝国主义者的恫吓和讹诈，或是现代修正主义分子的诋毁，都绝不能阻挡社会主义阵营的团结和威力的进一步增强。在同资本主义和平竞赛中，社会主义制度必然胜利。”
