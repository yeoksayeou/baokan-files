Random Notes from Su Village Camp
By Our Correspondent Jiang Wenpin

　　Wilderness Stationing and Encampment

　　After the people's communes were established in Fan County, like ten thousand horses galloping, a powerful field army was organized this autumn, stationed in the fields, and launching a surprise attack on the rush to harvest and plant. Recently, this reporter visited the "Su Village Camp" in the Wangzhuang war zone of the county.

　　When you enter this camp, you immediately feel a strong atmosphere of battle. Standing in the camp and looking around: in front, there is a grass shed mansion, which also serves as a Party school, Communist Youth League school, and club. Behind is the command post tent. Fifty-three huts are lined up side by side on the left and right, men on the east and women on the west. In front of the men's huts, thirty-two large pots are buried in a row from north to south for boiling soup and cooking. The bright red battle flag is flying in the air, what a majestic sight!

　　Su Village Camp commands twenty-one companies, and eight companies are stationed here. Nurseries, department stores, barbershops, health clinics, and sewing groups all live inside with the army. Everything is organized in an orderly manner for the people fighting here. They eat hot soup, hot dishes, and hot meals three times a day. At night, they sleep in tightly built huts. There are almost no sick people in the thousand-person camp, and each combatant has gained five or six pounds. People here receive good political and cultural education. Every Saturday night, they are given leave to go home and spend time with their spouses. Fifty days of training in corps operations have made these formerly more lax farmers love this happy collective life from the bottom of their hearts.

　　Large Corps Operations Shake the Earth

　　Su Village Camp has such a battle song circulating: "The army goes on an expedition, success is immediate, every attack is invincible, and we win everywhere," praising the benefits of large corps operations.

　　There is a plain east of Shahe Village, where 800 mu of wheat will be planted this year. They deployed a field army and launched an encirclement and annihilation battle. They call it the "Shahe Campaign." The officers and soldiers shouted such heroic words: "Grab Mount Tai as a pillow, kick over the Yellow River and reverse the flow. Fight a beautiful battle in Shahe, and guarantee production to strive for the top. Next year, the wheat yield per mu will be 30,000 jin, and we will report a good harvest in front of Tiananmen Square. Strive to go to Beijing for a meeting and shake hands with Chairman Mao." They turned over 400 mu of wheat fields to a depth of three to five chi, and another 400 mu to a depth of one chi and five cun, and it only took two days to plow and plant.

　　Here, is a scene of large corps operations. On the morning of October 19, five companies of the corps plowed the land together. More than 400 people lined up one after another to form a giant dragon. The commanders and fighters took off their cotton coats, some with bare backs, and declared war on the earth. The Old Huang Zhong Company and the Hua Mulan Company engaged in an undeclared battle. The old men shouted: "The Fifth Company is Old Huang Zhong, first fight Hua Mulan, then fight Mu Guiying." The women were unwilling to give in, and soon left the Fifth Company behind. They shouted: "Old Huang Zhong is useless, you have become prisoners!"
　
　　The "Old Huang Zhongs" shouted the slogans "Greatly exert ourselves, and especially exert ourselves," and in the blink of an eye, they plowed in front of the women again. In just one morning, they plowed more than 50 mu of land in this way, competing with each other.

　　Camp Commander Su Kuitan calculated a detailed account: Last year, they planted 8,100 mu of wheat, plowing to a depth of four cun, using only 3,000 jin of manure per mu, and the wheat was not planted until the Beginning of Winter. This year, they planted 8,400 mu of wheat, most of which was fertilized with more than 400,000 jin per mu, and most of the wheat fields were plowed to a depth of three to five chi. This year, they also transferred more than 400 laborers to go out to make iron and dig rivers, but they completed the wheat planting task 20 days earlier than last year. From this, we can see the unparalleled superiority of large corps operations.

　　Rear Service Department – "She Taijun Company"

　　Large corps operations cannot be separated from the strong support of the rear. The She Taijun Company, composed of more than 70 elderly women, is in charge of rear service work. Comrade Wang Sheng, the instructor of the She Taijun Company, is an old Communist Party member who joined the Party in 1938. In the past, when adhering to the underground struggle, she risked her life to deliver letters to underground Party comrades all year round. Now she is the propaganda committee member of the Party branch and a famous figure on the array champion list. Under her leadership, the company's work is very good, and it can make more than a dozen sets of clothes and fifteen or sixteen pairs of cloth shoes a day. The officers and soldiers are very satisfied with their work.

　　Guo Fengzhen, the deputy company commander of the Hua Mulan Company, is the mother of four children and could not wear a cotton coat during the Beginning of Winter in previous years. This year, the She Taijun Company made eight cotton clothes and six pairs of cloth shoes for her family in one day, and the whole family was warmly dressed. She said gratefully: "The She Taijun Company is stronger than my own mother, I have no worries, I just have to work hard!" This female company commander has been a model four times on the front.

　　The Times Create Heroes

　　In more than 50 days of large corps operations, "Su Village Camp" has created many commendable heroic deeds; a large number of outstanding figures have emerged. People everywhere are spreading moving stories such as "Old couple challenge," "Uncle and nephew contest," and "Father and son strive for the first."

　　Old woman Li Guilian and her husband Li Xuesen are both cooks in the same company. These old people who have suffered the hardships of the old society have joined the people's commune this year and participated in cooking work, and they really have unspeakable inner joy. The old couple cook during the day and compete in plowing the fields at night, and both husband and wife have become models. Old man Zhang Qiujiang heard on the front that three of the four members of Kong Qingsan's family had become models, and he was anxious. He called his son over, and the father and son challenged each other face to face. Later, the son was on the honor roll, and the old man really became a model. Soon, this honest old man also became the deputy company commander of the Old Huang Zhong Company.

　　Kong Songzhi, who was made a female camp commander by the commune members in more than 50 days, can be regarded as the leading woman in this camp. This heroic girl, who was once the head of the sisters' group and whose leadership of the land reform review caused a sensation, was controlled by her mother-in-law and husband after marrying into a wealthy middle peasant family, and she was shut at home for eight years without any success after giving birth to three children in a row. This time, the establishment of the people's commune and the organization of large corps operations made her like a bird out of a cage, and she was re-liberated. This capable and well-led woman showed her former qualities again. From being a squad leader and platoon leader to being the company commander of the Hua Mulan Company, she has always been the best cadre at completing tasks. The militia company also had to lose to her.

　　In the entire Su Village Camp, in the first battle round of the autumn harvest and rush planting, 44 red flags appeared among more than 51 cadres above the company level; 842 of the 1,170 combatants became models. Currently, they are conducting troop consolidation on the front, preparing to continue to advance forward.

    苏村营散记
    本报记者　姜文品
    野外屯兵安营扎寨
    万马奔腾的范县实现人民公社化以后，今秋组织了强大的野战兵团，在田头安营扎寨，突击抢收抢种。最近记者访问了这个县王庄战区的“苏村营”。
    当你走进这个营寨，立刻感到一种强烈的战斗气氛。站在营中四下一看：前有草棚大厦，里面兼作党校、团校、俱乐部。后有指挥官的寨棚。左右并排五十三个窝铺，男东女西，各列一旁。男子窝铺之前，南北一溜埋下三十二口大锅，烧汤做饭。鲜红的战旗在空中飘扬，好不威风凛凛！
    苏村营统率二十一个连队，这里驻扎了八个连。托儿所、百货店、理发部、卫生所、缝纫组都随军住在里面。战斗在这里的人们一切都组织得井井有条。一天三餐吃着热汤、热菜、热饭。晚间睡着搭得严严实实的窝铺。千人的兵营几乎没有病员，每个战斗员都增加了五、六斤体重。人们在这里受着良好的政治、文化教育。每逢星期六晚上放假，让已婚的男女回家过夫妇生活。五十多天兵团作战的锻炼，使这些原来较为散漫的农民，从心眼里爱上了这种欢乐的集体生活。
    大兵团作战威震大地
    苏村营流传着这样一支战歌：“大军出征，马到成功，攻无不克，处处得胜”，歌颂了大兵团作战的好处。
    沙河村以东有一片平川，今年要种八百亩小麦。他们开进了一个野战兵团，展开了围歼战。他们把这叫作“沙河战役”。官兵们喊着这样的豪言壮语：“抓过泰山当枕头，踢翻黄河水倒流。沙河打个漂亮仗，保证生产争上游。明年小麦亩产三万斤，天安门前报丰收。争取北京去开会，见了毛主席握握手。”他们把四百亩麦田翻了三至五尺深，另外四百亩翻了一尺五寸深，连翻带种只用了两天时间。
    这里，是大兵团作战的一个场面。10月19日清晨，兵团五个连在一起翻地，四百多人一个挨一个的排成一条巨龙，指战员们抡下棉袄，有的光着脊背，向大地宣战了。老黄忠连和花木兰连不宣而战地交了锋。老头们喊道：“第五连是老黄忠，先战花木兰，再战穆桂英”。妇女们哪里肯让，不多时把五连抛在后面。她们喊道：“老黄忠不中用，你们成了俘掳兵！”
  “老黄忠”们大声呼喊着“大干、特干”的口号，眨眼间又翻到妇女前面。一早上就这样你比我赛地翻了五十多亩地。
    苏奎坦营长算了一笔细账：去年他们种了八千一百亩小麦，犁地四寸深，每亩只用三千斤粪，直到立冬才种上了小麦。今年种了八千四百亩小麦，每亩施肥多数是四十万斤以上，大部分麦田都翻到三至五尺深，今年还调出四百多劳力外出炼铁、挖河，但比去年提前二十天完成了种麦任务。从这里可以看出大兵团作战的无比优越性。
    后方勤务部——“佘太君连”
    大兵团作战一时也离不开后方的有力支援。由七十多个老年妇女组成的佘太君连，专管后方的勤务工作。佘太君连的指导员王省同志，是1938年入党的老共产党员。当年在坚持地下斗争时，她长年累月冒着生命危险，给地下党的同志送信。现在她是党总支的宣传委员，也是阵地状元榜上的出名人物。这个连在她领导下工作的十分出色，一天能做出十几套衣服，十五、六双布鞋。指战员们对她们的工作十分满意。
    花木兰连的副连长郭风真是四个孩子的母亲，往年立冬时都穿不上棉袄。今年佘太君连一天的功夫，给她家做了八件棉衣、六双布鞋，閤家穿的暖暖和和。她感激地说：“佘太君连比俺亲娘还强，我啥顾虑也没有了，只管下劲干活吧！”这个女连长在阵地上当了四次模范。
    时势造英雄
    五十多天的大兵团作战，“苏村营”创造了许多可歌可颂的英雄事迹；大批的优秀人物涌现出来了。人们到处传颂着“老两口挑战”、“叔侄比武”、“父子争先”等动人的故事。
    老太婆李桂莲和老伴李学森同在一个连里当炊事员，这对受尽旧社会风霜之苦的老人，今年加入人民公社，又参加了做饭工作，真有说不尽的内心欢乐。老两口白天做饭，晚上到田里竞赛翻地，夫妻双双当了模范。张秋江老人在阵地上听说孔庆三一家四口有三口当了模范，心急了，叫了儿子过来，父子俩当面挑战。以后儿子上了光荣榜，老头果然当了模范。不久，这位忠厚的老人又当了老黄忠连的副连长。
    在五十余天中由社员当了女营长的孔宋芝，可算得这个营里的女中魁首。这个当年的姐妹团长、领导土改复查轰动一时的英雄姑娘，从嫁到富裕中农家里以后就被婆婆、丈夫管束起来，连着又生下三个孩子，一直关在家里八年没有出头。这次成立人民公社，组织大兵团作战，她如出笼之鸟，获得重新解放。这个精明能干、领导有方的妇女，又显出了当年的本色，从当班长、排长到当花木兰连长，一直是完成任务最好的干部。基干民兵连和她们竞赛，也不得不输在她的门下。
    整个苏村营，在秋收抢种的第一个战斗回合中，五十一个连以上干部出现了四十四面红旗；一千一百七十个战斗员有八百四十二人当了模范。目前，他们正在进行阵地整军，准备继续向前挺进。
