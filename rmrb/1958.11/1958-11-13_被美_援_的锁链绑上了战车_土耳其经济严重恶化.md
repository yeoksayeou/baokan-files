    Bound to the War Chariot by American "Aid"
    Turkey's Economy Seriously Deteriorates
    (Report from this newspaper) According to estimates by Turkish officials, Turkey's total import value this year may reach $630 million, a sharp increase of more than 50% compared to last year's import value of $400 million. The $234 million in loans and "aid" provided by the United States to Turkey in September is the main reason for the surge in imports. Most of this American "aid" will be used to pay for surplus American industrial and agricultural products. On the other hand, Turkey's export situation is declining even more than last year. According to statistics from January to April this year, Turkey's exports to the United States have decreased by 23.1% compared to the same period last year, and exports to major Western European countries have decreased by 31.3%. It is expected that this year's trade deficit will be much larger than last year. In the past decade, Turkey's total trade deficit has reached $1.06 billion.
    Due to its pursuit of a policy of following the United States in expanding its military and preparing for war, Turkey's economic situation has already deteriorated significantly. After the Turkish authorities raised foreign exchange rates in early August, prices rose rapidly. The new American "aid" of more than $230 million can only add fuel to the fire of Turkey's economic crisis. Turkey's "Akis" magazine bitterly said: "Since 1953, Turkey's national income has consistently ranked last among Middle Eastern countries, while the cost of living has consistently maintained the championship in this region."
    Hungry and cold Turkish workers have been forced to launch organized struggles to raise wages and protect their right to survival. Workers at the Kayseri textile factory and the Kırıkkale arms factory have collectively demanded that the government raise wages. Eight thousand workers from various enterprises of the Machinery Manufacturing and Chemical Industry Association have also declared that they will take strike action to demand improved living conditions. The Turkish "New Era Newspaper" pointed out: This will be the largest strike in Turkish history. (Attached picture)

    被美“援”的锁链绑上了战车
    土耳其经济严重恶化
    本报讯　据土耳其负责官员估计，土耳其今年入口总值可能达到六亿三千万美元，将比去年四亿美元的入口总值猛增50％以上。9月间美国向土耳其提供二亿三千四百万美元的贷款和“援助”，是入口猛增的主要原因。这笔美“援”的大部将用美国剩余工农业产品支付。另一方面，土耳其的出口情况，则比去年有更大的下跌。据今年1至4月的统计，土耳其对美国出口已比去年同期减少了23.1％，对西欧主要国家出口减少了31.3％。预料今年的贸易赤字将比去年有很大增加。按土耳其在过去十年中，贸易赤字总数已达十亿六千万美元。
    土耳其由于执行追随美国扩军备战政策，经济情况本已十分恶化。8月初土耳其当局提高外汇价格后，物价迅速上涨。二亿三千余万美元的新的美“援”，对于土耳其经济危机只能火上加油。土耳其的“阿基斯”杂志辛酸地说：“自从1953年以来，土耳其的国民收入在中东各国中间一直是倒数第一，而在生活费用方面，则一直保持着这个地区的冠军”。
    饥寒交迫的土耳其工人已经被迫为提高工资和保护自己的生存权利展开了有组织的斗争。开塞利的纺织工厂和克雷卡尔的兵工厂工人，都集体要求政府提高工资。机器制造业和化学工业协会各企业的八千名工人也声明将以罢工的行动要求改善生活条件。土耳其“新时代报”指出：这将是土耳其有史以来最大一次罢工。（附图片）
