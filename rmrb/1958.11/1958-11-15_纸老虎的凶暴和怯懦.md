The Ferocity and Cowardice of Paper Tigers
Tang Tao

Comrade Mao Zedong has always taught us: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers!" This brilliant thesis has armed our thinking and has long been proven by the victory of the Chinese revolution. What is a paper tiger? A paper tiger is outwardly fierce but inwardly weak; it appears powerful but is actually vulnerable. Why is it that something that looks so ferocious is actually useless? There is a reason for this. Comrade Mao Zedong revealed the essence of imperialism and all reactionaries by uncovering the surface.

The facts are so clearly displayed: Today, the one showing a hideous face on the world stage, sending troops to West Asia one moment and "escorting" in East Asia the next, dividing hydrogen bombs into clean and dirty types, and constantly carrying out atomic intimidation against peaceful people, is U.S. imperialism. Yet, the one filled with anxiety, secretly researching with experts convened by the Department of Defense about "whether it is possible to survive" in a future nuclear war and "under what conditions to surrender," is also this U.S. imperialism. In summary, a hundred kinds of intimidation and a sea of fear—this is the predicament of U.S. imperialism and the essence of imperialism and all reactionaries. If the "tiger" were not made of "paper," how could such a state of mind be explained?

To not admit that imperialism and all reactionaries are "tigers" would be incorrect, because they are indeed baring their fangs and claws. However, more importantly, this is a "tiger" made of "paper," often punctured with a single poke. "Paper" and "tiger" are unified here, it's one and the same thing, not two separate things. When Hitler was shouting orders and invading, almost sweeping across Europe, his final cowardly suicide was already foreshadowed, because he violated the will of the people and went against the historical development. Violence and cowardice seem contradictory, but in this madman—suddenly launching a lightning attack, and then suddenly committing suicide after a lightning marriage—they are harmoniously unified. Wasn't there a Sun Hao in the Three Kingdoms period? Initially, he peeled people's faces, gouged out their eyes, and was arrogant and cruel. The common people feared him like a tiger. But once he became a prisoner of Sima Yan, he became meek and servile, amusing himself by acting as a lackey. Not long ago, we also saw the tricks of Hussein, the "child emperor" of Jordan, in the newspapers. He formed a federation, broke off relations, clamored against communism, and arrested one hundred and fifty officers, with a fierce momentum. But when the Iraqi revolution succeeded and the Jordanian people followed, he was terrified and lived in constant fear. His first priority was to transport valuables to Cyprus, prepare a helicopter, and demand ten million pounds from the veteran U.S. agent Murphy as the price for his abdication, obediently fleeing abroad. Wouldn't you say that the contrast before and after is like two different people? No! It is very consistent! "The opposite of a despot is a slave. When in power, they do whatever they want; when they lose power, they are full of servility." (Lu Xun, see "Random Feelings Collection: Proverbs") This is the essence of imperialism and all reactionaries, this is the paper tiger.

Once you understand that the "tiger" is made of "paper," and understand that "the opposite of a despot is a slave," as long as you do not slack off or become complacent in specific struggles, then imperialism and all reactionaries are not only not scary, but when they bare their fangs and claws and pounce on you, you will find it quite ridiculous, and you will definitely be able to calmly laugh and deal with them, and defeat them.

    纸老虎的凶暴和怯懦
    唐弢
    毛泽东同志历来就教导我们：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎！”这个英明的论断武装了我们的思想，并且早已为中国革命的胜利所证明。什么叫做纸老虎？纸老虎就是色厉内荏，就是貌似强大，实际虚弱。为什么看来是那么凶残的东西，偏又并不顶用呢？这里有个道理，毛泽东同志揭开表象，指出了帝国主义和一切反动派的本质。
    事实就是这样彰明较著地摆着：今天，在世界舞台上现出狰狞的脸孔，一会儿向西亚出兵，一会儿往东亚“护航”，把氢弹分成什么干净龌龊，不断地对和平人民进行着原子恫吓的，是美帝国主义者；然而满怀忧惧，由国防部邀集专家偷偷地研究在未来的核战争中“能否存在下去”、“在什么条件下投降”的，也是这个美帝国主义者。概括起来说，百端恫吓，一片疑惧，这就是美帝国主义的处境，也是帝国主义和一切反动派的本质。如果说“老虎”不是出于“纸”做，这样的心理状态又怎么解释呢？
    不承认帝国主义和一切反动派是“老虎”，那是不对的，因为它的确在张牙舞爪，然而更重要的是：这是个“纸”糊的“老虎”，往往一戳即穿。“纸”和“老虎”在这里是统一的，是一回事而不是两回事。当希特勒呼么喝六，出兵侵略，几乎要席卷欧洲的时候，已经预伏着他最后怯懦地自杀的结局，因为他违背了人民的意志，和历史发展走了相反的道路。强暴和怯懦看似矛盾，但在这个疯人身上——忽而闪电进攻，忽而于闪电结婚后自杀，却又和谐地统一着。三国时不是有个孙皓吗？当初剥人面，凿人眼，骄盈残虐，老百姓畏之如虎；可是一旦当了司马炎的俘虏，却偏会低眉顺眼，凑趣打诨，以帮闲的身份自居。前不久我们还从报上看到约旦“儿皇帝”侯赛因的把戏，搞联邦，闹绝交，大叫反共，逮捕一百五十名军官，气势凶凶；可是当伊拉克革命胜利，约旦人民继起，他就心惊肉跳，惶惶然不可终日，第一件大事是把贵重物品运往塞浦路斯，准备好直升飞机，向美国老牌特务墨菲要求一千万英镑，作为退位的代价，乖乖的到外国逃命去。你说前后对照，不免判若两人吗？不！一致得很！“专制者的反面就是奴才，有权时无所不为，失势时即奴性十足。”（鲁迅，见“南腔北调集：“谚语”）这就是帝国主义和一切反动派的本质，这就是纸老虎。
    明白了“老虎”是“纸”糊的，明白了“专制者反面就是奴才”，只要你在具体斗争中不松懈，不麻痹，那么，帝国主义和一切反动派不仅并不可怕，而且当它张牙舞爪地向你扑来时，你反而会觉得十分可笑，一定能够从容地笑着来对付它、战胜它了。
