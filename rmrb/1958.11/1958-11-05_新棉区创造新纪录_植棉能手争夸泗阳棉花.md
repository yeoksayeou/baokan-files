    New Cotton Region Creates New Record
    Cotton-Growing Experts Vie to Praise Siyang Cotton
    (Our dispatch) The people of Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, after 180 days and nights of arduous struggle, have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest on 200,000 mu of cotton fields. According to preliminary measurements, the average yield of ginned cotton can reach over 250 jin per mu, a dramatic increase of more than six-fold compared to the highest yield of 41.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1957. Approximately 20,000 mu of land have a single-crop yield of ginned cotton of 400 to 500 jin, and more than 2,700 mu have a single-crop yield of ginned cotton of over 500 jin. Currently, over 50 million jin of seed cotton have been picked, averaging more than 250 jin per mu, while the middle and upper parts of the cotton plants are still laden with cotton bolls. The total output of ginned cotton in the county is estimated to reach over 50 million jin.

    A national cotton observation delegation of more than 300 people was very excited after visiting Siyang County. The representatives believe that Siyang's cotton has two major characteristics: First, the large area is good; every cotton plant grows like brothers, uniform, neat, with complete seedlings, large bolls, many bolls, and good bolls. Second, the management is good; even the cotton plants in full bloom still have green branches and lush leaves, and the lower, middle, and top layers of cotton bolls are well protected.

    Siyang County is a new cotton region, with only a short three-year history of large-scale cotton planting and historically low yields. The most fundamental reason for this year's leap in cotton production is that the people of the county, under the radiant illumination of the General Line, have unleashed soaring enthusiasm. The main experiences are:

    1. Liberated thinking, breaking the superstitious and conservative ideas that new cotton regions have "poor conditions, a weak foundation, and cannot improve yields," striving for progress, and continuously increasing measures as production targets increased, forming a mass movement to create miracles.

    2. Humbly learning advanced experiences and technologies from old cotton regions. They not only sent people to advanced cotton regions within the province for visits and studies but also organized observation groups to learn from Cixi in Zhejiang and Macheng and Hongan in Hubei, the counties with the highest cotton yields last year. They learned the experience of running experimental fields in Hongan County and the experience of cotton field management in Cixi and Macheng, and they further developed these experiences. At the same time, when they achieved some success, they promptly prevented complacency.

    3. Mobilizing the masses to conduct large-scale experimental fields. The county established a total of 100,091 mu of experimental fields, accounting for more than one-half of the county's cotton field area. In the large-scale experimental fields, the methods of "leading, catching up, competing, and surpassing" were adopted, with experimental fields leading large fields, and large fields catching up and in turn promoting experimental fields, forming a mass competition and collaboration between experimental fields and between large fields and experimental fields. This allowed cotton fields to grow evenly over large areas.

    4. Implementing specialized management. From the county to the township to the commune, the first secretary took the lead in leading cotton production. There are more than 5,000 cadres in the county engaged in cotton production. Commune members also implemented specialized management for crops such as cotton and rice.

    5. Conducting an agricultural technology revolution. Achieving early planting, close planting, timely topdressing, and thorough pest control.

    新棉区创造新纪录
    植棉能手争夸泗阳棉花
    本报讯　江苏省泗阳县人民经过一百八十天日夜苦战，二十万亩棉田获得空前大丰收。据初步测定，平均单产皮棉可达二百五十斤以上，比产量最高的1957年单产皮棉四十一点五斤，猛增六倍多。全县约有二万亩单产皮棉可达四百到五百斤，有二千七百多亩单产皮棉可达五百斤以上。目前已采摘籽棉五千多万斤，平均每亩收了二百五十多斤，而棉株的中部和上部仍然棉桃累累。预计全县总产皮棉可达五千多万斤。
    全国棉花参观团一行三百多人，在泗阳县参观后，十分兴奋。代表们认为泗阳的棉花有两个最大特点：一是大面积的好，每一块棉花长的像哥儿兄弟一样，均匀、整齐、苗全、桃大、桃多、桃好。二是管理的好，即使正在盛开的棉花，依然是枝青叶茂，棉株下层、中层和顶层的棉桃都保的很好。
    泗阳县是一个新棉区，大面积种植棉花还只有短短三年历史，历来产量低，今年的棉花产量所以能够大跳特跳，最根本的原因是全县人民在总路线的光辉照耀下，发挥了冲天的干劲。主要经验是：
    一、解放了思想，破除了所谓新棉区“条件差、底子穷、产量提不高”的迷信保守思想，发奋图强，随着产量指标的提高，措施不断加码，形成了一个创奇迹的群众性运动。
    二、虚心的向老棉区学习先进经验和技术。他们不仅多次派人到省内的先进棉区参观学习，而且还组织参观团到去年棉花产量最高的浙江慈溪和湖北麻城、红安等县取经。他们在红安县学到了搞试验田的经验，在慈溪、麻城两县学到了棉田管理的经验，并且又把这些经验加以发展。同时，当在自己取得了一些成绩时，又及时防止了自满情绪。
    三、发动群众，大搞试验田。全县共搞了十万零九十一亩试验田，占全县棉田面积的二分之一强。在大搞试验田中，由于采取“带、赶、赛、超”的办法，试验田带大田，大田赶上了又反过来推动试验田，形成了一个群众性的试验田与试验田、大田与试验田之间的大竞赛、大协作。这样就使棉田大面积生长平衡。
    四、实行了专业专管。从县到乡到社，都以第一书记挂帅，领导棉花生产。全县搞棉花的干部共有五千多人。社员也都以棉花、水稻等作物，实行专业专管。
    五、进行了农业技术革命。做到早播、密植、适时追肥和彻底防治虫害等。
