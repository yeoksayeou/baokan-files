This year, Yuanjiang trifoliate oranges in Hunan Province have had an abundant harvest. Over one million jin of fresh trifoliate oranges have been harvested, which can be processed into 2,500 dan of dried goods, a 13% increase over last year, and the product quality has also been greatly improved.

The abundant harvest of Yuanjiang trifoliate oranges is mainly due to the strengthening of trifoliate orange tree cultivation work. For example, the more than 1,000 trifoliate orange trees in the Nanzhu Agricultural Cooperative of Shoujian Township have all been cultivated with soil, topdressed with fertilizer, pruned and shaped, and treated for disease and pest control.

The Hunan Provincial Department of Health held an on-site meeting on trifoliate orange procurement in the county, specifically studying and arranging the procurement and processing of trifoliate oranges. The past centralized processing was changed to decentralized processing at agricultural cooperatives in the producing areas, reducing processing losses.

    沅江枳壳丰收
    今年湖南省沅江枳壳获得丰收。下树的鲜枳壳一百多万斤，可加工干货两千五百担，比去年增产13％，产品质量也有很大提高。
    沅江枳壳丰收，主要是加强了枳树培植工作，如首建乡南竹农业社的一千多株枳树，都经过培土、追肥、修剪整枝、防治病虫等。
    湖南省卫生厅在该县召开了全省枳壳收购现场会议，专门研究和布置了枳壳的收购和加工工作。将过去集中加工改为分散到产区农业社加工，减少了加工损失。
