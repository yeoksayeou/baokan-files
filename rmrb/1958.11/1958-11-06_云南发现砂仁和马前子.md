Yunnan Province Pharmaceutical Company's work team discovered a large number of wild "Amomum villosum", Strychnos nux-vomica, Coptis chinensis and other medicinal materials in the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province. In the gullies of Tianbao and other places in Malipo County, a large area of "Amomum villosum" stretching for fifty miles is growing well. It is estimated that there are at least more than 40,000 plants in the county. Local farmers already have experience in artificial cultivation. Yang Zaifu, a farmer in Douchidian, transplanted one "Amomum villosum" from the farmer Wang Shiqing's home in 1953, and it has now developed into more than 3,000 plants, each bearing seven to fifteen "Amomum villosum" fruits. A large amount of Strychnos nux-vomica was also discovered in Malipo County.

    云南发现砂仁和马前子
    云南省药材公司工作组在该省文山僮族自治州发现大量野生“砂仁”、马前子、黄连等药材。在麻栗坡县的天保等地山沟中，绵延五十华里的大片“砂仁”，生长良好。据估计全县最少也有四万多株。当地农民已具有人工栽培经验，该县豆豉店农民杨在福于1953年从农民王世清家移栽一株“砂仁”，现在已发展到三千多株，每株结“砂仁”七至十五粒。麻栗坡县还发现大量的马前子。
