Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, New York Dispatch: U.S. propaganda organizations are observing with astonishment and dismay Khrushchev’s report on the outline of the seven-year plan for the development of the Soviet national economy.

The “New York Times” of the 16th, in its “Week in Review” column, wrote that the Soviet Union’s new economic development plan is “the most audacious economic challenge Russia has yet issued to the United States and the West.” The newspaper believes that the Soviet Union’s new development plan proves that the Soviet Union "does not intend to fight." It said that the Soviet Union "needs peace to achieve its goals." The newspaper also worried that Khrushchev's report had made a deep impression on other countries, especially underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa. Because, forty years ago, Russia was still a backward country, but today the Soviet Union has become a model for rapid economic development.

An article by "New York Times" reporter Schwartz said that this plan shocked the world. The author pointed out that the Soviet Union has full conditions to realize this plan: the Soviet Union's natural resources greatly exceed those of the United States; the Soviet Union is now one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world; the Soviet Union's residents have good education; the Soviet economy has no recession and depression. The author said that it can be expected that "in the next ten years, the Soviet economy will continue to flourish rapidly."

The day before, the "New York Times" also said in an editorial: "By 1970, the living standards of the Soviet people will be the highest in the world, and the level of product production, whether calculated by absolute figures or by population ratio, will exceed ours. At the same time, by 1965, the industrial output of the communist bloc will also be more than that of the free world." The newspaper called on the West to "consider the prospect of increasingly intensified Soviet economic competition."

The "New York Herald Tribune" wrote in its November 16 editorial that the task the Soviet Union wants to accomplish is "staggering." The newspaper concluded that this ambitious plan tells the United States that its industrial leadership is threatened.

Thomas Whitney, an international news analyst for the "Associated Press," in an analytical news report on the 15th, while viciously slandering the socialist camp, also had to admit that the Soviet Union's economic development plan is "certain to be completed." He wrote despondently: "Economic experience in the United States shows that although the United States may make some progress in increasing industrial production and other production between now and 1965, this progress will be slow and uneven. The Russians' goal is to increase their production at a much faster rate."

### 美国报刊瞠目结舌地承认  苏联能够完成七年计划  生产水平定将超过美国

    美国报刊瞠目结舌地承认
    苏联能够完成七年计划  生产水平定将超过美国
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息，美国宣传机构以惊愕和沮丧的情绪注视着赫鲁晓夫提出的关于发展苏联国民经济七年计划的报告提纲。
    16日的“纽约时报”在“一周大事”栏中写道，苏联的新的发展经济计划是“俄国迄今向美国和西方发出的经济挑战中最大胆的一个”。报纸认为，苏联新的发展计划证明苏联“不打算打仗”。它说，苏联“需要和平来实现它的目标”。这家报纸还担心，赫鲁晓夫的报告提纲对其他国家、首先是对亚非的不发达国家产生了深刻的印象。因为，四十年前的俄国还是一个落后的国家，而今天的苏联已经成为迅速发展经济的榜样。
    “纽约时报”记者施瓦茨的文章说，这个计划使世界为之震惊。作者指出，苏联具有充分的条件来实现这个计划：苏联的天然资源大大超过美国的资源；苏联现在是世界上技术最发达的国家之一；苏联的居民有良好的教育；苏联的经济没有衰退和萧条。作者说，可以预计，“在今后十年内，苏联的经济将继续迅速地蓬勃发展”。
    在这前一天，“纽约时报”还在社论中说：“到1970年，苏联人民的生活水平将是世界上最高的，产品生产水平无论按绝对数字算还是按人口比例算，都将超过我们。同时，到1965年共产主义集团的工业品产量也要比自由世界多。”这家报纸呼吁西方“要考虑苏联经济竞争日益加强这样一种前景”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”16日的社论写道，苏联所要完成的任务“令人瞠目结舌”。报纸得出结论说，这个宏伟的计划告诉美国：它在工业上所占的领先地位受到威胁。
    “美联社”国际新闻分析员托马斯·惠特尼在15日写的一篇分析性新闻中虽然对社会主义阵营进行了恶毒的诬蔑，但是他也不得不承认，苏联的这一经济发展计划是“一定会完成的”。他沮丧地写道：“美国在经济方面的经验表明，虽然美国在现在到1965年之间在增加工业产量和其他产量方面也许会有某些进展，但是这种进展将是缓慢的，并且会是起伏不定的。俄国人的目标是要以更快得多的速度增加他们的生产。”
