    From Iron Ore to Steel
    Wang Gan Yi
    Iron and steelmaking are no longer unfamiliar to each of us. If, half a year ago, most of us were still laymen, now many people can confidently say: I am also a warrior on the steel front.
    In fact, our ancestors knew how to use iron and steel thousands of years ago. Since the advent of iron and steel production, the Iron Age in human history began. The earth's crust contains a lot of iron. In terms of metal content, it is second only to aluminum, ranking second. According to different compositions, there are several types such as magnetite, hematite, limonite, and siderite. According to the amount of iron content, it can be divided into rich ore and poor ore. Iron ore not only contains oxygen, but also contains many impurities such as sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. When smelting iron, iron ore, coke (or charcoal), and limestone are loaded into the blast furnace in a certain proportion. When the temperature in the furnace reaches above 1,000 degrees, the carbon gradually takes away the oxygen in the ore, and the limestone combines with the impurities in the ore to form slag. In this way, iron is separated from oxygen and most impurities. After that, the iron absorbs carbon and becomes easier to melt. Generally speaking, if the furnace has a temperature above 1,200 degrees, molten iron will drip to the bottom of the furnace. There is also a layer of molten slag on top of the molten iron. When enough molten iron has accumulated, the taphole can be opened to tap the iron.
    Pig iron has a high carbon content (more than 1.7%) and also contains more impurities such as sulfur and phosphorus, so it is very brittle and cannot be forged. This requires steelmaking to reduce the carbon and impurities in pig iron. There are many methods of steelmaking. The common methods now are low-temperature steelmaking, reverberatory furnace, crucible, converter, open-hearth furnace, electric furnace, etc. Although the steelmaking methods are different and the equipment used is different, they basically use oxidation to reduce the carbon content in the iron and remove impurities. After carbon and impurities are oxidized, some become gas and escape, and some become slag and separate from the iron. Finally, we can obtain steel with good mechanical properties.
    After the steel is made, we also need to make it into the required shapes, such as agricultural tools, machine parts, steel plates, steel wires, steel beams, steel pipes, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to use methods such as hammering and rolling to make various steel products. After forging and rolling, the steel becomes denser and has better properties. The so-called "hammered and tempered" comes from here. Sometimes, in order to improve the performance of the steel, heat treatment is also required, which is to heat the steel to an appropriate temperature and cool it down at different speeds. For example, rapid cooling in water or oil is called "quenching"; slow cooling is called "annealing," and so on. Which heat treatment method to use depends on the steel grade and requirements.
    There are many types of steel. If classified according to composition, it can be roughly divided into two categories: carbon steel and alloy steel. The main components of carbon steel are iron and carbon, in addition to small amounts of elements such as manganese, silicon, phosphorus, and sulfur. Changing the amount of carbon in the steel can produce soft steel that is easy to cut and bend but not easy to break, or very hard steel, or steel that can be cut and bent but is also very hard. If elements such as manganese, silicon, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, and tungsten are added to the steel, it becomes alloy steel. Various alloying elements have different effects on the properties of steel. According to different uses and requirements, various steel grades can be formulated, such as structural steel, tool steel, ball bearing steel, stainless steel, acid-resistant steel, high-temperature steel, magnetic steel, transformer steel, and so on. These steels are indispensable materials in machine manufacturing, aviation, railway construction, agricultural machinery, telecommunications, military industry, and other economic sectors.

    从铁矿石到钢材
    王干一
    炼铁炼钢，对于我们每个人来说，已经不算是生疏的事了。如果说，在半年以前，我们大多数人还是门外汉，那么，现在一定有不少人能充满信心地说：我也是一个钢铁战线上的战士了。
    其实，我们的祖先在几千年以前就会使用钢铁了。自从钢铁生产问世以后就开始了人类历史上的铁器时代。地壳中蕴藏着很多的铁，在金属中它的蕴藏量仅次于铝，占第二位。按成分的不同有磁铁矿、赤铁矿、褐铁矿、菱铁矿等数种。按含铁量的多少可分为富矿和贫矿。铁矿中不但含有氧，而且还含有许多杂质如硫、磷、矽等。炼铁时要把铁矿石与焦炭（或木炭）及石灰石等按一定比例装入高炉中。等炉中温度达到一千度以上时，炭就逐渐把矿石中的氧夺去，而石灰石就与矿石中的杂质化合成为渣。这样铁就与氧及大部分杂质分开了。此后铁又吸收炭，而变得比较容易熔化。一般说，若炉中具有一千二百度以上的温度就有铁水滴到炉底。在铁水上面还有一层熔化了的渣，等铁水积蓄多了就可打开出铁口出铁了。
    生铁中含炭量高（1.7％以上），含硫磷等杂质也较多，因此很脆，不能锻造。这就需要炼钢，以便减少生铁中的炭和杂质。炼钢的方法有许多种，现在常见的有低温炼钢、反射炉、坩锅、转炉、平炉、电炉等方法。虽然炼钢方法不同，所用设备不同，但基本上都是用氧化的方法降低铁中炭的含量及除去杂质。炭及杂质被氧化后有的成为气体冒出来，有的变成渣子而从铁中分出来。最后我们就可以得到机械性能很好的钢了。
    炼好了钢以后，我们还要把它作成所需要的形状，如农具、机械零件以及钢板、钢丝、钢梁、钢管等等。于是需要用锤锻、压轧等方法制成各种钢材。经过锻轧后钢就更加致密，性质更好。所谓“千锤百炼”也正是由这里来的。有时为了提高钢的性能还需要进行热处理，就是把钢加热到适当温度并以不同快慢速度冷下来。例如在水中或油中迅速冷却就叫做“淬火”；有的慢慢地冷就叫做“退火”等等。究竟要用什么办法热处理，这要根据钢号和要求来决定。
    钢的种类很多。如果按照成分来分，可大致上分为两大类：炭钢与合金钢。炭钢的主要成分是铁和炭，此外还有少量锰、矽、磷、硫等元素。改变钢中炭的分量，就能得到容易切削和弯曲但不易折断的软钢，或是非常硬的钢，或是可以切削弯曲但又很硬的钢。如果在钢中加入锰、矽、铬、镍、钼、钒、钨等元素就成为合金钢。各种合金元素对钢的性质有不同的影响。根据不同用处及要求可以配制各种钢号：如结构钢、工具钢、滚珠轴承钢、不锈钢、耐酸钢、高温钢、磁钢、变压器钢等等。这些钢在机器制造、航空、铁路建设、农业机械、电讯、军事工业及其他经济部门中都是不可少的材料。
