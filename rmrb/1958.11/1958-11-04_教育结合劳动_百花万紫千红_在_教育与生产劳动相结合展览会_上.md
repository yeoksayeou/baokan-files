Introducing Local Pavilions at the "Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor"

    Jiangxi: Inheriting the Glorious Tradition of Education in the Old Revolutionary Base Areas

    The historical materials and objects related to education in the old revolutionary base areas in the Jiangxi Pavilion, which attracted much attention, filled several tables. A wooden rifle used by the Young Pioneers of the Lenin Elementary School to stand guard, and a cotton gin personally modified by Comrade Xu Teli (then Acting Minister of Culture and Education of the Soviet Central Government) with teachers from the Lenin Normal School and the Central Agricultural School, clearly demonstrated the vivid scene of education in the Soviet area serving the revolutionary war and combining with productive labor.

    In order to inherit and carry forward the Party's revolutionary education tradition and support the development of mountainous areas, in June of this year, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee decided to establish Communist Labor Universities in all large-scale comprehensive reclamation farms throughout the province. This is a new type of proletarian university that implements work-study programs and part-time work and part-time study. More than 90% of the students are workers, farmers, and children of workers and farmers. It is currently the largest university in the country, including a main campus and forty-six branch campuses, with more than 22,000 students.

    By the end of this year, secondary schools in this province will produce 19,282 tons of iron and 9,148 tons of steel. Most schools have established machinery factories and universally run farms. Currently, schools throughout the province own approximately 42,000 mu of cultivated land.

    On a large rectangular table, a dazzling array of porcelain was displayed. These were all made by the students of the Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute and the students of the Jingdezhen No. 2 Elementary School. The quality of the red scarf's "Eight Little Curly-Haired Cats" from the Jingdezhen No. 2 Elementary School's children's porcelain factory, in terms of their expressions, colors, and curly-hair techniques, surpassed international standards.

    Shanghai: Extensively Linked with Factories and Agricultural Cooperatives

    The Shanghai Pavilion introduced the situation of various schools being linked with factories, agricultural cooperatives, and self-run factories. Secondary schools alone have been linked with 2,600 factories, nearly 400 agricultural cooperatives, and more than 100 handicraft cooperatives. Many of the factories run by the schools themselves are advanced, large-scale, and precision industries, such as the shipyard run by Jiaotong University and the electron tube factory run by Fudan University. Secondary vocational schools, technical schools, and some ordinary middle schools have transformed their internship workshops into factories by using the original equipment of each school; elementary school students also go to factories to participate in production labor within their capabilities, or run their own juvenile factories. In rural areas, schools have established many granular fertilizer factories. Recently, a situation of schools turning into factories and factories turning into schools has emerged in Shanghai; some middle schools have already implemented part-time work and part-time study, and they want to train middle school students to become third-grade technicians.

    The scientific research of various universities in Shanghai, on the basis of comprehensive cooperation with scientific research institutions and production units, has formulated a scientific research plan. The exhibition hall introduced that this year, on National Day, the scientific research achievements of twelve schools totaled more than 7,300 items, of which 762 were more important. The exhibits here include bottles of dyes, which are the achievements of the East China Institute of Chemical Technology. This institute has researched and developed more than 100 kinds of reactive dyes, including normal type, B type, C type, D type, E type, etc., more than 10 kinds of reactive blacks, as well as phthalocyanine dyes and Irgalan dyes, which have caught up with and surpassed the United Kingdom and West Germany in these aspects.

    Since the second half of this year, Shanghai has launched a campaign to vigorously develop amateur education, which has spread to all walks of life and all districts. At present, there are more than 6,200 amateur schools in the city, including more than 2,820 for workers, more than 2,080 for farmers, and more than 1,320 for citizens.

    The Shanghai Pavilion also introduced in detail the incident of the Shanghai Second Medical College rescuing Qiu Cai Kang, a worker from the Shanghai No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant.

    Fujian: Study, Labor, Fight

    Fujian is the outpost of the motherland. The broad masses of teachers and students in Fujian Province, especially in Xiamen City, are undergoing training in the heroic struggle against the enemy. They hold guns in one hand and books in the other, studying, laboring, and fighting while persisting in teaching and scientific research. The deeds of teachers and students in Yunxiao, Jinjiang, and other counties who bravely supported the front lines were also exhibited here.

    The Fujian Pavilion also specially set up a "Satellite Station," on which were displayed the achievements of Xiamen University and other universities and some secondary vocational schools that persisted in the struggle against the enemy in cutting-edge science, including the world's first complete "lancelet" specimen. The lancelet is a creature that transitions from lower to higher levels, and is of great significance for the study of biological evolution. There are also advanced glass that surpasses the United States and semiconductor research products that reach international levels.

    Many kinds of handicrafts reflecting the local characteristics of Fujian are displayed in the exhibition hall, including bodiless lacquerware, bamboo ware, etc., as well as the products of the shell factory of Pingtan Experimental Elementary School.

    Fujian originally had a weak industrial base. Now, secondary schools alone have established 12,658 factories in the categories of smelting, machinery, and chemical fertilizers, and 3,046 farms. (Attached photo)

    教育结合劳动　百花万紫千红
    在“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”上
    江西：继承老区教育的光荣传统
    江西馆引人注意的老革命根据地的教育历史资料、实物，摆满了几个桌子。一杆列宁小学儿童团站岗放哨用的木枪，一座徐特立同志（当时苏维埃中央文教部代部长）亲自领导列宁师范和中央农业学校教师改装的轧棉机，清楚地说明了苏区教育为革命战争服务、与生产劳动相结合的生动情景。
    为了继承和发扬党的革命教育传统，支援开发山区建设，今年6月，中共江西省委决定在全省各大型综合垦殖场创办共产主义劳动大学。这是一所实行勤工俭学、半工半读，新型的无产阶级的大学。学生中90％以上都是工人、农民和工农子弟。它是目前国内规模最大的大学，包括一个总校和四十六个分校，有学生二万二千多人。
    这个省的中等学校到今年年底要产铁一万九千二百八十二吨，产钢九千一百四十八吨。大部分学校都建立了机械厂，普遍办起了农场，现在全省学校拥有耕地约四万二千余亩。
    在一个大型长方桌上，摆满了五光十色、琳琅满目的瓷器。这些都是景德镇陶瓷学院学生和景德镇第二小学学生们亲自制作的。景德镇第二小学少年瓷厂红领巾的“八只小卷花猫”的情态、色彩和卷花技术等方面的质量，都超过了国际水平。
    上海：广泛同工厂农业社挂钩
    上海馆介绍了各学校同工厂、农业社等挂钩以及自办工厂的情况。仅中学就已经同二千六百个工厂、近四百个农业社、一百多手工业合作社挂钩。各学校自办的工厂，其中许多是高级的、大型的、精密工业的，如交通大学办的造船厂、复旦大学办的电子管厂等。中等专业学校、技工学校和部分普通中学，利用各校原有设备，改实习工场为工厂；小学生们也到工厂去参加力所能及的生产劳动，或自办少年工场。在农村，各学校则办了许多颗粒肥料厂。最近上海出现了学校变工厂、工厂变学校的局面；部分中学已经实行半工半读，要把中学生培养成三级技工。
    上海各高等学校的科学研究，在同科学研究机关、生产单位实行全面大协作的基础上，订出了科学研究规划。展览馆介绍，今年国庆节，十二个学校的科学研究成就共献礼七千三百多项，其中较重要的有七百六十二项。这里展品，有一瓶瓶的染料，是华东化工学院的成果，这个学院已研究出一百多种活性染料，包括常型、B型、C型、D型、E型等种，有活性黑十多种，还有酞青染料、爱尔新兰，这些方面都赶上和超过英国、西德。
    从今年下半年起，上海市掀起了大办业余教育的运动，遍及各行各业各区。目前全市已经有六千二百多所业余学校，其中职工的二千八百二十多所，农民的二千零八十多所，市民的一千三百二十多所。
    上海馆还详细地介绍了上海第二医学院抢救上海第三钢铁厂工人丘财康的事件。
    福建：学习·劳动·战斗
    福建是祖国的前哨。福建省的广大师生特别是厦门市的师生们，正在英勇的对敌斗争中经受着锻炼，他们一手持枪，一手拿书，边学习、边劳动、边战斗，坚持进行教学和科学研究。这里还展出了云霄、晋江等县学校师生奋勇支援前线的事迹。
    福建馆还特别设置了一个“卫星台”，台上陈列着坚持对敌斗争的厦门大学等几所高等学校和部分中等专业学校，在尖端科学方面的成就，其中有世界上第一套完整的“文昌鱼”标本，文昌鱼是一种从低级向高级过渡的生物，对研究生物进化有极重要的意义。这里还有压倒美国的高级玻璃，达到国际水平的半导体研究产品等。
    在展览馆陈列着许多种反映福建地方特色的手工艺品，有脱胎漆器、竹器等，还有平潭实验小学贝壳工厂的产品。
    福建原来工业基础薄弱，现在仅是中等学校就办起了冶炼、机器、化肥等类工厂一万二千六百五十八个，农场三千零四十六个。（附图片）
