    Huge Steps Towards Communism in the Soviet Union
    The control figures for the development of the Soviet Union's national economy from 1959 to 1965 have been published. This seven-year plan will undergo two months of national discussion and then be submitted to the 21st Congress of the CPSU for adoption and implementation. This grand plan, with its unprecedented scale, its leaping development speed, its spirit of overwhelming imperialism in peaceful competition, and its majestic posture of marching towards a communist society, has won cheers from the socialist camp and progressive mankind all over the world, and has shocked imperialism and all reactionaries. Our people feel infinite excitement and encouragement towards this huge step of the Soviet Union towards communism.
    The Soviet Seven-Year Plan presents a vision of the Soviet national economy reaching unprecedented prosperity and the Soviet people living the best life in the world. In seven years, the Soviet Union's steel production will increase from 55 million tons in 1958 to 86-91 million tons in 1965, a net increase of 31-36 million tons, which is equal to the level of steel production in the entire Soviet Union in 1951 or 1952. In seven years, the Soviet Union's oil production will increase from 113 million tons in 1958 to 231-240 million tons in 1965, a net increase of 117-127 million tons, which is roughly equal to the total oil production of the entire Soviet Union from 1945 to 1949. In seven years, the Soviet Union's electricity generation will increase from 233 billion kilowatt-hours in 1958 to 510-520 billion kilowatt-hours in 1965, a net increase of 267-287 billion kilowatt-hours, which is greater than the electricity generation of the entire Soviet Union in 1957. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's annual grain output will reach 10-11 billion poods, averaging about 900 kilograms (1,800 jin) of grain per person for a population of 200 million. In seven years, the real income of workers and staff will increase by an average of 40%, and the real income of collective farmers will also increase by at least 40%. Workers and staff will only work six or seven hours a day, and will have two days off each week. The number of students will increase to 40 million, with one in five people in the entire Soviet Union studying at school.
    From the picture opened up by the Seven-Year Plan, we can see the main characteristics of the Soviet Union's development in the next seven years. First, "on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, further vigorously develop all economic sectors, and vigorously strengthen the country's economic potential to ensure the continuous improvement of the people's living standards." On the one hand, the growth of the production of means of production will still be faster than the growth of the production of means of livelihood (the former will increase by 85% to 88% in seven years, and the latter will increase by 62% to 65%); on the other hand, agriculture and light industry will have amazing development. The total output value of light industry will increase by about half in seven years. The output of daily necessities will double. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will exceed the current level of the United States in terms of the total output of the most important agricultural products and the output per capita; in terms of the total output of textiles, clothing, and shoes, and the output per capita, the Soviet Union will approach the level of the United States. Second, "develop the national economy at a high speed, while carrying out the necessary balancing." The Soviet Union's total industrial output value will increase by 80% in seven years, that is, an average annual growth of more than 10%, which is a very high speed. The previous five-year plans have generally maintained such a growth rate, but the absolute amount it represents is increasing year by year. In the past seven years, the average annual increase in output value was about 90 billion rubles, while in the next seven years it will be 135 billion rubles. As in the past, the development speed of various departments of the Soviet national economy will be relatively balanced. Third, improve the layout of productive forces, accelerate the economic development of the eastern regions (including the Urals, Siberia, the Far East, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia), and pay attention to the specialization and comprehensive development of large economic regions. Fourth, further promote the latest technology and develop cutting-edge science. In the machinery industry, the latest achievements of science and technology will be used to manufacture the latest equipment for various departments of the national economy and improve the level of automation. Soviet scientists, who have climbed the peak of world science, will deepen their research on cosmic rays, nuclear reactions, semiconductors, and so on. Fifth, while further developing socialist productive forces, socialist relations of production will be improved. Comrade Khrushchev's report outline stated: "While formulating plans for further developing agriculture, we must improve socialist relations of production, so that the two kinds of socialist ownership—collective farm ownership and ownership by the whole people—will gradually merge into one. With the development of collective farm production, the material and welfare needs of collective farmers will be increasingly met by the public economy, so their individual sideline occupations will gradually lose their role."
    The inspiring Seven-Year Plan is a component of the Soviet Union's fifteen-year economic program for building communism. Last November, at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that the level of annual output of Soviet industrial products in about fifteen years would be the level at which the Soviet Union caught up with and surpassed the current level of the United States. Judging from the targets of the Seven-Year Plan, this time limit will be greatly shortened, both in terms of the absolute amount of production and the output calculated per capita. Taking steel as an example, the Soviet Union's current proposal to reach 86-91 million tons in seven years is already closer to the 100-120 million tons proposed last November, while the United States' steel production this year will be no more than 84 million tons. This shows how strong the Soviet Union's economic potential is.
    History proves that because socialist countries have an absolute advantage over capitalist countries in the growth rate of production, socialist countries will inevitably and irresistibly catch up with and surpass capitalist countries in terms of the absolute output of production and the output calculated per capita. This is an objective law of development that does not depend on the wishes of capitalist countries. Although the Soviet Union has experienced several wars and destructions in the past forty-one years, and has only been able to use more than half of its time for peaceful production, it has now surpassed all major capitalist countries except the United States in terms of the absolute output of industrial products. The result of the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will make the Soviet Union also leave them, including Britain and West Germany, behind in terms of output calculated per capita. In recent years, some Western bourgeois economists have been promoting a "theory" that as the absolute output of Soviet industrial production increases, its growth rate will decrease and will approach the speed of industrial development in capitalist countries. American economic publications are spreading another "theory" that the growth rate of Soviet industry can catch up with the United States, but the gap between absolute output continues to widen. These "theories" collapse in the face of facts. Last year and this year, Soviet industrial output each increased by more than 10%, while the United States stagnated last year and decreased by 9.4% in the first nine months of this year. From 1954 to 1957, the total output of Soviet agriculture increased by an average of 7.1% each year, while the United States only increased by 1.1%. The Soviet Seven-Year Plan predicts that the time when the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will defeat the imperialist camp headed by the United States in peaceful competition is getting closer and closer.
    The great Soviet people, under the wise leadership of the glorious Soviet Communist Party, will smoothly complete the discussion of the Seven-Year Plan, will victoriously implement this magnificent plan, and will prepare a more solid material foundation for building a communist society in the Soviet Union, and will make outstanding contributions to further strengthening the world socialist system.

### 苏联走向共产主义的巨大步骤

    苏联走向共产主义的巨大步骤
    1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字公布了。这个七年计划将经过两个月的全民讨论，然后提交苏共第二十一次代表大会通过执行。这个宏伟计划以空前巨大的规模，以飞跃发展的速度，以在和平竞赛中压倒帝国主义的气概，以向共产主义社会迈进的雄姿，博得社会主义阵营和全世界进步人类的欢呼，引起帝国主义和一切反动派的震惊。我国人民对苏联走向共产主义的这个巨大步骤，感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。
    苏联七年计划在人们面前展现一幅苏联国民经济将达到前所未有的繁荣，苏联人民将过着全世界最美好的生活的前景。七年中，苏联的钢产量将从1958年的五千五百万吨增加到1965年的八千六百—九千一百万吨，纯增三千一百一三千六百万吨，这个增长数等于1951年或1952年全苏联产钢的水平。七年中，苏联的石油产量将从1958年的一亿一千三百万吨增加到1965年的二亿三千一二亿四千万吨，纯增一亿一千七百——亿二千七百万吨，这个增长数约等于1945到1949年全苏联石油产量总和。七年中，苏联的发电量将从1958年的二千三百三十亿度增加到1965年的五千一五千二百亿度，纯增二千六百七十—二千八百七十亿度，这个增长数大于1957年全苏联的发电量。到七年计划结束时，苏联谷物的年产量将达到一百—一百一十亿普特，以两亿人口平均，每人将得到约九百公斤（一千八百市斤）谷物。七年中，职工的实际收入平均将增加40％，集体农民的实际收入也将至少提高40％。职工每天将只作六、七小时工作，而且每周将有两个休息天。学生人数将增加到四千万人，全苏联每五人中将有一人在学校学习。
    从七年计划所打开的图景中，可以看出苏联今后七年发展的主要特点。第一，“在优先发展重工业基础上进一步大力发展所有经济部门，大力加强国家的经济潜力，以保证人民生活水平的不断提高。”一方面，生产资料生产的增长，仍将快于生活资料的生产的增长（在七年中，前者增长85％到88％，后者增长62％到65％）；另一方面，农业和轻工业都将有惊人的发展。七年间轻工业的总产量将增加大约半倍。日用品的产量将增加一倍。在七年计划结束时，在最重要的农产品的总产量和按人口平均的产量方面，苏联将超过美国现在的水平；在纺织品、衣服、鞋类的总产量和按人口平均的产量方面，苏联将接近美国的水平。第二，“以高速度发展国民经济，同时进行必要的平衡”。苏联工业总产值在七年中将增加80％，即每年平均增长10％以上，这是很高的速度。历次五年计划大体上都保持了这样的增长率，但它所代表的绝对量是年年高涨的。过去七年每年平均增产值约为九百亿卢布，而今后七年每年则为一千三百五十亿卢布。同以往一样，苏联国民经济各部门的发展速度将是比较平衡的。第三，改进生产力的布局，加速发展东部地区（包括乌拉尔、西伯利亚、远东、哈萨克斯坦和中亚）的经济，注意大的经济地区的专业化和综合发展。第四，进一步推广最新技术和发展尖端科学，在机械工业方面，将利用科学技术的最新成就，为国民经济各部门制造最新设备，并提高自动化水平。攀登了世界科学高峰的苏联科学家将加深研究宇宙线、原子核反应、半导体等等问题。第五，在进一步发展社会主义生产力的同时，将改进社会主义的生产关系。赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲中说：“在制定进一步发展农业计划的同时，要改善社会主义的生产关系，使两种社会主义所有制——集体农庄所有制和全民所有制逐步合而为一。随着集体农庄生产的发展，集体农民的物质和福利需要将越来越多地依靠公有经济得到满足，因此他们的个人副业将逐渐失去它的作用。”
    振奋人心的七年计划，是苏联建设共产主义的十五年经济纲领的组成部分。去年11月，在庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的苏联最高苏维埃会议上，赫鲁晓夫同志曾经指出，在十五年左右苏联工业品年产量将达到的水平，也就是苏联赶上和超过美国现在的水平。从七年计划的指标看来，无论在生产的绝对数量方面，或者按人口平均计算的产量方面，这个期限都将大大缩短。以钢为例，苏联现在所提出的七年内达到八千六百万一九千一百万吨，与去年11月所提出的十五年内达到一亿—一亿二千万吨已经较为接近，而今年美国的钢产量将不过八千四百万吨。这说明，苏联拥有何等雄厚的经济潜力。
    历史证明：由于社会主义国家在生产增长速度上对资本主义国家占绝对优势，社会主义国家就必然不可阻挡地要在生产的绝对产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上和超过资本主义国家。这是不以资本主义国家的愿望为转移的客观发展规律。苏联四十一年来虽然经历了几次的战争和破坏，只能用了一半多的时间进行和平生产，但是现在它已经在工业品的绝对产量方面超过了除美国以外的所有主要的资本主义国家。七年计划执行的结果，将使苏联按人口平均计算的产量方面也把它们，包括英国和西德，都抛到后面去。最近几年来，一部分西方资产阶级经济学者在宣扬一种“理论”，据说随着苏联工业生产的绝对产量的提高，它的增长速度将会降低，将会接近于资本主义国家工业发展的速度。美国的经济刊物在传播另一种“理论”，据说苏联工业的增长速度赶得上美国，但是绝对产量之间的差额继续扩大。这些“理论”在事实面前不驳自倒了。去年和今年苏联工业产量各增长10％以上，而美国去年停滞不前，今年头九个月降低9.4％。从1954到1957年，苏联农业总产量每年平均增长7.1％，而美国只增长1.1％。苏联七年计划预示：以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在和平竞赛中比垮以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的时间，已经越来越逼近了。
    伟大的苏联人民，在英明的苏联共产党的领导之下，将会顺利地完成七年计划的讨论，将会胜利地执行这个宏伟的计划，而为在苏联建立共产主义社会准备更雄厚的物质基础，为进一步壮大世界社会主义体系作出卓越的贡献。
