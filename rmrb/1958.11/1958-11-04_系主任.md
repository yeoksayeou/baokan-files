    Department Head
    Feng Jiannan
    Cook Aunt Fan had just sat down to work the bellows when Old Zhang walked into the cafeteria. He is the department head of the Public Cafeteria Department of the Red and Expert University—a part-time position he took on a month ago. As for his main job, he has been a cook at the elementary school for a full six years. Although his main job comes with a salary and his part-time job is unpaid; although his main job is simple and his part-time job is complex, Old Zhang treats both positions with the same enthusiasm and dedication. Look, he's here so early, instead of sleeping at home.
    The administrators and cooks of the public cafeteria are all students of the Red and Expert University's Public Cafeteria Department. Old Zhang mainly teaches classes in the cafeteria, but he does not neglect classroom teaching either (borrowing the elementary school's classroom). When making steamed buns, put the right amount of flour, the right amount of yam shreds, and the right amount of water; when cooking dishes, pay attention to the heat and the seasoning; cooks should pay attention to hygiene and service attitude; the cafeteria should be orderly and no idlers should be allowed in; administrators should listen to the opinions of the masses and publish accounts on time. These are the main points he emphasizes in his lectures and organizes students to discuss.
    The cafeteria where Aunt Fan works is Old Zhang's "experimental field." Today, as soon as he walked in, he felt satisfied: the cooking stove and the walls had been whitewashed again yesterday; all the utensils were placed so pleasingly, conveniently, shining and bright; the cooks were all wearing new work clothes, which made it even more presentable. What made him especially happy was that the certificate of merit recently issued by the County People's Committee was hanging on the west wall. Under the certificate of merit, there was a large piece of red paper with the "Resolution" of all the staff of the cafeteria written on it. The "guaranteed conditions" on this paper can be said to be a summary of the experience of teaching combined with practice in the entire department under Old Zhang's leadership for more than a month. This was summarized last night in the classroom teaching with all the students in the department. He organized the students—that is, the staff of all nine public cafeterias in the village—to observe his "experimental field," held an "on-site meeting," conducted evaluations, and democratically decided which cafeteria would receive the certificate of merit.
      "We must summarize our experiences," Old Zhang read the resolution word by word, then turned around and said. "We must also look forward. Seeing the bumper harvest in the autumn, our cafeteria must adapt to this new situation, otherwise, we will be in a mess!"
    "That's the truth!" said Old Song, the cafeteria administrator. "Not to mention anything else, the autumn harvest distribution is coming up, and this year the grain is not distributed to households, but to the cafeterias—isn't this a new situation?"
    "Isn't there going to be a big communal feast?" said Aunt Fan. "Old Zhang, how are we going to do the big communal feast!"
      "There is a way!" said the department head. "Our commune has yams piled up like mountains. Yams are a treasure. How to eat them, how to make them good. I am researching—" (He took out a book from his pocket: "A Hundred Ways to Make Yam Pastries") "I want to let the commune members eat dozens of different things made of yams at the big communal feast!"
    At this moment, the clock struck four times. Old Zhang left this cafeteria, and after a while, he walked into another brightly lit public cafeteria.

    系主任
    冯健男
    炊事员范大娘刚坐下来拉风箱，老张就走进食堂里来了。他是红专大学公共食堂系的主任——这是他在一个月以前新担任的兼职，至于他的本职，小学校里的炊事员，他已经担任了整六年了。虽然本职拿薪金，兼职尽义务；本职单纯，兼职复杂，可是老张对待这两个职务是同样热心，同样全力以赴。你看，这么早，他不在家里睡觉，就跑到这里来了。
    公共食堂的管理员和炊事员都是红专大学公共食堂系的学生。老张教课主要就在食堂，但也不忽视课堂（借用小学校的课堂）教学。作馒头放适量的面、适量的山药丝、适量的水；作菜要注意火候，注意调配；炊事员要讲究卫生，讲究服务态度；食堂里要秩序井然，闲人免进；管理员要多听取群众意见，按时公布账目，这些就是他着重讲解和组织学生们讨论的主要内容。
    范大娘所在的这个食堂是老张的“试验田”。今天他一走进来，就感到满意：锅台和墙壁，昨天又粉刷过了；所有的用具都放得那么顺眼、顺手、发光、发亮；炊事员们都穿起新的工作服来了，这就更加像个样子了。特别叫他欢喜的是，县人民委员会新发下来的奖状，在西边的墙上挂起来了。在奖状下面，贴着一张大红纸，写的是这个食堂全体工作人员的“决心书”。这上面的“保证条件”，可以说是一个多月来在老张主持下的全系教学结合实践的经验总结。这是他在昨天晚上的课堂教学上和全系学生一同总结出来的。他组织了学生们——也就是全村九个公共食堂的工作人员们观摩了他的“试验田”，开了一次“现场会议”，进行了评比，民主决定了奖状发给哪个食堂。
      “我们要总结经验，”老张逐字逐句地念完了决心书，然后回过头来说。“也要往前看。眼看着秋收大丰产，我们食堂要适应这个新形势，要不，就会闹得手忙脚乱哪！”
    “这是实话！”食堂管理员老宋说。“别的不说，眼看就要秋收分配，今年粮食不分到户，都分到食堂——这不就是新情况？”
    “不是要大会餐吗？”范大娘说“老张，大会餐我们怎样搞呀！”
      “有办法！”系主任说。“我们社里山药蛋堆成山。山药蛋，是个宝，怎样吃，怎样好。我正在研究——”（他从口袋里掏出一本书：“山药制点心法百种”）“我要叫社员在大会餐吃上几十样山药蛋做的东西！”
    这时，时钟当、当、当、当地响了四下。老张离开了这个食堂，过了一会儿，又走进另一个灯火通明的公共食堂里去了。
