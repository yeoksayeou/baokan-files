Combining Winter Ploughing to Prevent Overwintering Pests
Hunan Strives to Become a Pest-Free Province Next Year

(Our Dispatch) Judging from the already harvested early and mid-season rice, the historically disastrous situation of rice stem borers, rice stink bugs, and leaf beetles in Hunan Province has ended this year. Currently, the province has eliminated pests on one-quarter of its total cultivated land area. Recently, various regions have combined winter ploughing with a campaign to prevent overwintering pests, striving to make the entire province a "pest-free" province next year.

The basic characteristics of this year's pest control are: strong determination from Party committees, mass mobilization, a combination of protracted war and encirclement campaigns, local pesticides taking the lead, foreign pesticides supplementing, fierce attacks, and quick victories.

Due to the warm climate last winter and this spring, the large winter planting area, and other reasons, pests occurred early and fiercely this year, with the affected area exceeding previous years. Thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants, each pest control campaign involved hundreds of thousands or millions of people in a comprehensive encirclement. Therefore, the pest damage rate for early and mid-season rice in the province this year has been compressed to about 1%, which is smaller than in any previous year.

The basic experiences of pest control in various regions this year are: first, the secretaries personally took command, fully mobilized the masses, established pest control organizations at all levels, and set up a mass-based pest information network to ensnare pests, grasp the pest situation, seize the opportune moment, and annihilate them in one fell swoop. On May 25 this year, based on the analysis of pest forecasts from below, the Yizhang County Party Committee predicted that rice planthoppers would occur widely in mid-June. On June 5, when only a few short-winged adults had appeared in the fields, the Yizhang County Party Committee, led by First Secretary Wang Qunsheng, mobilized more than 100,000 people to adopt the strategy of "taking pre-emptive action and comprehensive encirclement," and after five days and nights of hard work, eliminated the rice planthoppers before they became widespread.

Second, taking the mass line in pest control can not only implement the policy of "treating early, treating small, treating immediately," but also, after the masses are mobilized, they can use local materials to produce local pesticides and local machinery for pest control, which has played a significant role in this year's pest control. This year, the masses in various regions set up more than 100,000 local pesticide factories, producing more than 3.9 billion jin of local pesticides, which is more than 140 times the amount of chemical pesticides used in the province this year.

Third, the experience here shows that any complacency in pest control is harmful. In the past, pest damage in Huitong County was not serious, and the leadership initially lacked determination in pest control. When early rice was being planted, rice planthoppers occurred extensively, resulting in an estimated 20% reduction in yield for about 10,000 mu of early rice.

### 结合冬耕防治越冬虫害  湖南争取明年为无虫害省

    结合冬耕防治越冬虫害
    湖南争取明年为无虫害省
    本报讯　从已收获的早、中稻来看，湖南省历史性的螟虫、稻椿象、负泥虫为害成灾的局面，今年都已结束了。现在，全省已在占总耕地四分之一的作物面积上，消灭了虫害。最近各地结合冬耕，开展了防治越冬虫害运动，力争明年全省实现“无虫害”省。
    今年治虫的基本特点是：党委领导决心大，全民动员，持久战与围剿战相结合，土药打冲锋，洋药作补充，猛攻猛打，速战速决。
    由于去冬今春气候温暖，冬种面积大等原因，今年全省虫害发生早，来势凶猛，发生虫害面积超过往年。由于广大农民干劲冲天，每次出动治虫都是几十万、几百万人的全面大围剿。因此今年全省早、中稻的虫害损失率已压缩到1％左右，较以往任何年都小。
    今年各地治虫的基本经验，首先，书记亲自挂帅，充分发动群众，层层建立治虫组织，建立群众性的病虫情报网，给害虫安下天罗地网，掌握虫情，抓住火候，一举而歼之。今年5月25日，中共宜章县委根据下面虫情预报的分析，稻飞虱将在6月中旬普遍发生。6月5日，当田间刚刚出现少数短翅成虫时，就由中共宜章县委第一书记王群生担任统帅，全县出动十多万人采取“先发制人、全面围剿”的战略，苦战五昼夜，把稻飞虱消灭在大发生前。
    其次，治虫走群众路线，不仅可以贯彻“治早、治小、治了”的方针，而且群众行动起来后，就地取材，大搞土药、土械治虫，对今年扑灭虫害起了重大作用。今年各地群众办起十多万个土药工厂，制出土药三十九亿多斤，为今年全省使用化学农药量的一百四十多倍。
    再次，这里经验说明治虫中任何麻痹思想是有害的。会同县过去虫害不严重，开始领导治虫决心不大，早稻低头撒子时，稻飞虱大发生，约有一万亩早稻较估产减少收成20％。
