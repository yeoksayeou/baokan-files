Combining Manual and Mental Labor, All-Around Development
Laying the Foundation for All-Rounders from an Early Age

"Work-study programs are inspiring, turning backward students into advanced ones. Combining education and labor well, new schools produce new people." This poem was written by the masses of Siping City, Jilin Province, to praise the great achievements of the Sixth Malu Primary School in the city in carrying out work-study programs.

The fifth issue of "Fenjin" published the report of this primary school on carrying out work-study programs and the comments of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. The comments stated: Marx said in "Critique of the Gotha Program," "Early combination of productive labor with education is one of the most powerful means for the transformation of modern society." The work-study movement carried out in primary schools throughout the province, especially the Red Pioneer Factory movement in the Sixth Malu Primary School in Siping City, fully proves the correctness of Marx's assertion. From the very beginning of childhood, combining education with labor and closely integrating book knowledge with labor will fundamentally change children's ideological quality and moral outlook. The result of half a year of practice is that primary school students are more disciplined, love labor, and their mental outlook is changing, and new moral qualities are growing. They proudly boast that they are both students and little workers and little farmers. Therefore, the idea that carrying out work-study programs in primary schools will affect health and the quality of learning has been refuted by a large number of facts.

The comments also stated: Implementing work-study programs in primary schools is the beginning of cultivating new people who are comprehensively developed in communist society. Therefore, according to the age characteristics and physical and mental development of primary school students, they should be gradually guided from participating in light labor to participating in more complex labor, from low to high, from simple to complex. The labor participated in by primary school students should be age-appropriate and diversified in order to cultivate students' diverse interests. Through work-study programs, conduct education that combines manual and mental labor for all-around development, and learn to master simple production knowledge and skills. Lay a good foundation for cultivating "all-rounders" who combine mental and physical labor, and are both workers, farmers, soldiers and students.

Don't Let Pragmatism Muddle the Waters

The "Jianghai Academic Journal" published in its ninth issue an article entitled "On the Combination of Education and Productive Labor," which analyzes the fundamental difference between the Party's policy of combining education and labor and the view of "learning by doing" emphasized by pragmatist educators.

The author writes: We oppose the reactionary educational views of bourgeois pragmatist educators who one-sidedly emphasize "learning by doing." This is because: (1) Their "doing" and "learning" are for adapting to the needs of capitalist society and proceeding from the interests of the bourgeoisie. They educate students with bourgeois ideology, promote the sanctity of the capitalist system, and train students to acquire a little simple, fragmented means of making a living and life skills, knowing only what it is but not why. Their purpose is to cultivate servants "who can create profits for the master and at the same time not disturb the master's peace" (Lenin's words). (2) They proceed from the idealistic and reactionary point of view, deny objective truth, deny the importance of learning theory, emphasize that students develop so-called "innate instincts" in "doing," and deny the role of teachers and education, which is actually to abolish school education.

Our advocacy of the combination of education and labor cannot be confused with the bourgeois pragmatist's "learning by doing." (1) Our implementation of the combination of education and labor is for the needs of socialist revolution and socialist construction, proceeding from the fundamental interests of the proletariat and all working people, and the purpose is to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. (2) We proceed from the Marxist dialectical materialist point of view, acknowledge objective truth, that is, we attach importance to the educational role of teachers, and also attach importance to the necessity of students' own practice; we must learn systematic book knowledge—indirect knowledge, and also directly master knowledge in labor; we attach importance to both rational knowledge and perceptual knowledge; we attach importance to both theory and practice. We dialectically unify the above-mentioned opposing aspects, and the fundamental method is the combination of education and labor.

Criticizing the "Wait-and-See" Faction in Educational Work

Are there still doubters and "wait-and-see" factions in implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor? The article "Resolutely Implement the Policy of Combining Education with Productive Labor" published in the fourth issue of "Xin Lunyu" gives an affirmative answer to this question. The article believes that a major and most marketable fallacy of the "wait-and-see" faction is "carrying out work-study programs will reduce the quality of teaching." They believe that work-study programs "affect theoretical and scientific research work," "hinder teaching and normal learning," "waste time and talent, and the gains do not outweigh the losses," "universities farming and working are not as good as running worker-peasant night schools," and so on.

The author used the great achievements made by Shandong Province in implementing the policy of combining education and productive labor to give the "wait-and-see" faction a head-on blow. The article writes: In the past six months, the vast number of teachers and students have established a labor perspective, improved their political awareness, and cultivated communist ideology by participating in productive labor. Through labor practice, they have broadened their thinking, deepened their understanding of theory, and opened up broad avenues for scientific research work. The author said: Students have socialist and communist consciousness, knowledge that fully combines theory with practice, a healthy body, and can engage in both mental and physical labor. This is the teaching quality required by our socialist education. If there is any reduction after the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor, it is precisely the reduction of the teaching quality advocated by bourgeois education scholars. This kind of quality should not only be reduced but must be eliminated.

### 手脑并用　全面发展

    手脑并用　全面发展
    从小打下多面手的基础
    “勤工俭学动人心，落后学生变先进。教育劳动结合好，新的学校出新人。”这首诗是吉林四平市群众，为赞扬该市六马路小学开展勤工俭学活动取得很大成绩而写的。
  “奋进”第五期刊登了这个小学关于开展勤工俭学的报告和中共吉林省委的批语。批语中说：马克思在
  “哥达纲领批判”一书中说，“生产劳动和教育的早期结合就是改造现代社会的最强有力的手段之一。”从全省小学开展勤工俭学的运动中，特别是从四平市六马路小学办红领巾工厂的运动中，完全证明了马克思这一论断的正确。从儿童的第一步就把教育与劳动结合起来，把书本知识和劳动密切结合起来，就会使儿童的思想品质和道德面貌发生根本的变化。半年来的实践结果，小学生格外守纪律了，爱劳动了，精神面貌在变化，新的道德品质在成长。他们自己夸耀地说他们既是学生又是小工人和小农民。因此，那种认为小学搞勤工俭学会影响健康、影响学习质量的说法，在大量事实面前，已不攻自破。
    批语还说：小学实行勤工俭学，是培养共产主义社会全面发展新人的开端。因此应该根据小学生的年龄特征，身心发展状况，由低到高，由简到繁，逐步引导他们从参加轻微的劳动，渐进到能参加较为繁杂的劳动。小学生参加劳动要同年龄相适应，要多样化，以便培养学生多方面的兴趣。通过勤工俭学进行手脑并用全面发展的教育，并学会掌握简单的生产知识和技能。为培养成为脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的亦工亦农亦学亦兵的“多面手”打下良好的基础。
    不让实用主义鱼目混珠
    第九期“江海学刊”发表的“论教育与生产劳动结合”一文分析了党的教育与劳动结合方针和实用主义教育家所强调的“从做中学”的观点的根本不同。
    作者写道：我们反对资产阶级实用主义教育家片面强调“从做中学”的反动的教育观点。这是因为：（一）他们“做”的一套“学”的一套，是为了适应资本主义社会的需要，从资产阶级的利益出发。他们用资产阶级的思想教育学生，宣扬资本主义制度的神圣不可侵犯；训练学生获得一点简单的零碎片断的谋生手段和生活技能，只是知其然而不知其所以然。其目的是培养“既能替主人创造利润，同时又不会惊扰主人安宁”的奴仆（列宁语）。（二）他们从唯心主义的反动观点出发，否认客观真理，否定学习理论的重要性，强调学生在“做”中发展所谓“先天本能”，否定教师和教育的作用，实际上是取消学校教育。
    我们主张教育与劳动结合，与资产阶级实用主义的“做中学”完全不能混为一谈。（一）我们实行教育和劳动的结合是为了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要，是从无产阶级和全体劳动人民的根本利益出发，目的是培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。（二）我们是从马克思主义的辩证唯物主义观点出发，承认客观真理，即重视教师的教育作用，又重视学生自己实践的必要；既要学习系统的书本知识——间接知识，又要在劳动中直接掌握知识；既重视理性知识，又重视感性知识；既重视理论，又重视实践。我们是把上述的各个对立面辩证的统一起来，其根本办法就是教育与劳动结合。
    斥教育工作中的观潮派
    在贯彻教育与劳动生产相结合的方针上，是不是还有怀疑派、观潮派呢？“新论语”第四期刊载的“坚决贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针”一文对这个问题作了肯定的回答，文章认为，观潮派的一个主要的和最有市场的谬论是“开展勤工俭学会降低教学质量”，他们认为勤工俭学“影响理论和科学研究工作”，“妨碍教学和正常学习”，“浪费时间和人材，得不偿失”，“大学务农做工，不如办工农夜校”等等。
    作者用山东省贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针所取得的巨大成绩，给了观潮派当头一棒。文章写道：半年来广大师生由于参加了生产劳动，树立了劳动观点，提高了政治觉悟，培养了共产主义的思想。通过劳动实践，开扩了思路，加深了对理论的理解，并为科学研究工作开辟了广阔的道路。作者说道：学生有社会主义和共产主义的觉悟，有理论同实际完全结合的知识，有健康的身体，既能脑力劳动也能体力劳动，这就是我们社会主义教育所要求的教学质量。在贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针后，如果说有什么降低的话，正是降低了资产阶级教育学者所主张的教学质量。对于这种质量，不仅应降低，而且必须清除。
