    Sparks of Struggle
    Small Stories from the Japanese People's Anti-Police Duties Law Movement
    Untearable Flyers
    On the afternoon of November 4th, a "Aki" express train departed from Hiroshima. Before and after departure, railway workers posted many flyers against the revision of the Police Duties Law on the train. Along the way, the number of flyers on the train increased, reaching about six hundred when it arrived at Kyoto Station. The railway authorities hurriedly sent people to tear down the flyers and issued instructions to all stations to destroy them. However, due to the railway workers' response to the union's call to protect the flyers, they were pasted very firmly, and the stopping time at each station was short, so the vast majority of the flyers were preserved intact.
      A Night of Silent Protest
    On November 4th, after the Kishi Nobusuke government illegally extended the Diet session, more than two hundred representatives of the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation, which was mobilizing students across the country to oppose the revision of the Police Duties Law, were extremely indignant. To protest, they gathered on the road in front of the Diet members' meeting place from 8:00 p.m. and held a silent sit-in all night long.
      Give Him Such a Rest
    In the "Grand Hotel," known as the "branch office" of the Liberal Democratic Party headquarters, lived Kawashima, the secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party. On November 5th, because the Socialist Party completely refused to participate in the Diet's deliberations, the Diet's committees could not hold meetings, and Kawashima had to go home to "rest." However, the hotel staff went on strike to oppose the revision of the Police Duties Law. They didn't even bring him food. He told reporters at the Liberal Democratic Party press club in the Diet that this matter "really surprised me."
            We Can't Go Back to the Old Days
    On the afternoon of October 30th, the Socialist Party held a film screening session in the rest room of the Diet's House of Councillors to oppose the revision of the Police Duties Law. The films screened at this meeting were silent documentaries from twenty-eight or twenty-nine years ago. These films documented the actual situation of the Japanese people celebrating "May Day" in 1929 and 1930, and the funeral of Yamamoto Senji, who was victimized under the suppression of the Japanese reactionary authorities at that time. The screen showed fascist police surrounding the demonstration procession, their numbers far outnumbering the demonstrators. They rudely searched the people participating in the demonstration. Yamamoto Senji's funeral showed the solemn ranks of the Japanese people protesting against the fascist police's atrocities. This film screening had a great practical educational effect. The audience said with emotion that we must not let such days come again!
                  Two Generations
    On the morning of October 28th, Sato, the director of the Defense Bureau of the Kishi Nobusuke government's Defense Agency, was going to the Diet for a meeting. At this time, his son, who was studying at the University of Tokyo, said that he must participate in the demonstration against the revision of the Police Duties Law today. Sato used his authority as a parent to prevent his son from participating in "that kind of nonsense." However, his son insisted on going. A fierce quarrel broke out between father and son, and his son still went to participate in the demonstration.

    斗争的火花
    日本人民反警官法运动中的小故事
    撕不掉的传单
    11月4日下午，从广岛开出了一列“安艺”号快车。在发车前后，铁路工人们在车上贴了许多反对修改警官法的传单。沿途车身上的传单有增无已，到达京都车站时，传单已经增到六百张左右。铁道当局急忙派出一些人来撕传单，并且向各车站发出撕毁传单的指示。但是，由于铁路工人响应工会关于保护传单的号召，把传单贴得很牢，各站停车时间又短，绝大多数传单都完整地保存下来。
      彻夜静坐抗议
    11月4日，岸信介政府非法延长国会会期后，正在动员全国学生反对修改警官法的全日本学生自治会总联合会的二百多名代表，异常激愤。他们为了抗议，从晚八时起集聚在国会议员会面所前面的马路上，静坐了一个通宵。
      给他这样休息
    在号称自由民主党本部的“分处”的“格兰德饭店”里，住着自由民主党的干事长川岛。11月5日，由于社会党全面拒绝参加国会的审议工作，国会的各委员会都开不成会，川岛只好回家“休息”。但是，饭店服务员为反对修改警官法举行罢工。他连饭都没有端给他吃。他在国会的自由民主党记者俱乐部里对记者们说：这件事“实在使我吃惊”。
            不能再过旧日子
    10月30日下午，社会党在国会参议院的休息室里举行了一次反对修改警官法的电影放映大会。在这次会上放映的，是距今二十八、九年以前的无声纪录影片。这些影片是纪录1929年和1930年时日本人民庆祝“五一”节的实况，和当时在日本反动当局镇压下受害的山本宣治的送葬仪式。银幕上出现了法西斯警察包围了示威游行的队伍，他们的人数比示威游行者要多得多。他们蛮横地搜查着参加示威游行的人。山本宣治的送葬仪式，显示了日本人民抗议法西斯警察暴行的庄严行列。这次电影放映会，具有极大的现实教育作用。观众感动地说，不能再让那样的日子到来！
                  两代人
    10月28日早上，岸信介政府防卫厅的防卫局长左藤，要到国会去开会。这时，他在东京大学读书的儿子，说今天他一定要参加反对修改警官法的示威游行。左藤使出家长的威风，阻止他的儿子参加“那种胡闹的事情”。但是，他的儿子却非去不可。父子之间发生了激烈的口角，他的儿子还是去参加了示威游行。
