Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 25th: Hunan Province is adopting methods of plot-by-plot assessment and field consultation to carry out a review and supplement campaign for winter crops. Since the beginning of November, in the four special districts of Xiangtan, Hengyang, Changde, and Qianyang, approximately 1.1 million people daily have been transplanting seedlings and carrying out inter-tillage and topdressing work in the fields. Generally, winter crops have been inter-tilled and top-dressed once, and a small number of third-class seedlings have been supplemented with seedlings and replanting, with topdressing and cultivation done two or three times. At present, most of the winter crops sown throughout the province are growing well, with rapeseed and wheat seedlings already a tender green and generally five or six inches high.

This year, winter sowing in Hunan Province was generally completed ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years. Deep plowing, close planting, and fertilization were all better than in previous years. However, because these tasks were mostly carried out in a concentrated manner, coupled with the autumn drought, the sowing quality in some areas was not good enough. In some areas where cultivation and management were grasped later, third-class seedlings of winter crops accounted for about 15%; in some places, there was even a phenomenon of no management after sowing. To this end, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a telephone conference, requiring all localities to take measures to strengthen field management and immediately launch a review and supplement campaign.

The characteristics of winter crop cultivation and management this year are: secretaries taking the lead, debates at all levels, unifying thinking, unified arrangement of labor, establishment of specialized teams, division of responsibility areas, assigning people, land, time, and crops, contracting to the end, and ensuring full seedlings and full harvest. In Pingjiang County, 400,000 mu of rapeseed were sown, generally deep-plowed more than one chi, and an average of 210 dan of base fertilizer was applied per mu. At the beginning, some people believed that there was enough base fertilizer and there was no need to top-dress and cultivate, resulting in a phenomenon of no one cultivating after sowing. After the county party committee organized a major debate on "whether winter crops need cultivation and management" throughout the county, more than 300,000 mu of rapeseed have completed one inter-tillage and topdressing.

Another feature of cultivating winter crops is that various localities are vigorously developing high-yield fields to achieve more harvest with less planting. According to statistics from Xiangtan and Shaoyang special districts, more than 1.5 million mu of high-yield fields have been planted, with general high-yield fields accounting for about 15% of the winter crop area.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 25th: Wheat in Sichuan Province has mostly begun to emerge, and rapeseed is growing vigorously. People's communes in various places are intensively carrying out topdressing, irrigation, thinning seedlings, and pest control.

Zizhong, Anyue, Rongxian and other counties have organized field management professional teams of more than 400,000 people, established and implemented "three weedings, four topdressings" and "four nos" (no third-class seedlings, no weeds, no diseases and insect pests, no livestock trampling), "five fixings" (fixing people, time, fertilizer, quality, and output) and other field management systems and responsibility systems. In Jianyang County, many people's communes have established small spring management technology research stations, research groups, and technology dissemination organizations. This year, small spring crops are planted deeply and densely, and supplying sufficient water and fertilizer has become a prominent issue in current field management. Dazhou Special District has recently launched a concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaign for this purpose in the past ten days. Pingchang County also launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign under the slogan of "sludge going uphill, fertilizer coming out of sheds, manure pits turning over, and land being roasted." People's communes in various places are also vigorously running local fertilizer plants and are stepping up the rush production of water-lifting tools.

This year, as soon as the tense sowing ended, party committees in various parts of Sichuan strengthened their leadership over field management work. Many prefectural and county party committee secretaries in Nanchong, Neijiang, and other special districts went deep into the countryside to promptly understand the field management situation, discover problems, and study measures. Because many farmers have long had the habit of "emphasizing planting and neglecting management," various localities have strengthened political and ideological work, educating the masses to establish the idea that "a good harvest can only be achieved by planting well and managing well." After Dawang People's Commune in Nanbu County completed sowing, some people became complacent and relaxed, believing that planting was good and they did not want to go to work for management. The commune immediately launched a debate on "Is it over once the planting is good?" The members listed many facts of past reduced harvests due to good planting but poor management, criticized this idea, and at the same time proposed that field management should be strengthened this year because to thoroughly implement the eight-character "constitution" for agricultural production, various advanced measures must be conscientiously implemented. In this way, the commune's field management quickly entered a climax.

### 湖南四川加强田间管理  对冬种作物复查补课

    湖南四川加强田间管理
    对冬种作物复查补课
    据新华社长沙25日电　湖南省各地正采取逐丘鉴定、田间会诊的办法，开展冬种作物复查补课运动。湘潭、衡阳、常德、黔阳四个专区从11月上旬以来，每天约有一百一十多万人在田间移兜补苗，进行中耕追肥工作。一般冬种作物已进行一次中耕追肥，少数三类苗已补兜补种，追肥培育两、三次。目前全省已播冬种作物大部分生长良好，油菜、麦苗已一片嫩绿，一般苗都有五、六寸高。
    湖南省今年冬种一般较往年提早十天到半个月完成。深耕、密植、施肥等工作都较往年好。但由于这些工作大都是在突击情况下进行的，加上秋旱，所以有些地方的播种质量不够好。有些对培育管理抓得较晚的地区，冬种作物三类苗占15％左右；也有些地方还一度出现过播种后无人管理的现象。为此，中共湖南省委最近召开电话会议，要求各地采取措施，加强田间管理，立即开展复查补课运动。
    今年各地开展冬作物培育管理的特点是：书记挂帅，层层辩论，统一思想，统一安排劳力，建立专业队，划分责任区，定人、定地、定时、定作物，一包到底，保证全苗全收。平江县播种的四十万亩油菜，一般深耕一尺以上，平均每亩施足基肥二百一十担。开始有些人认为基肥足，无需再追肥培育，出现种后无人培育的现象。县委在全县组织了一场“冬作物要不要培育管理”的大辩论后，全县已有三十多万亩油菜完成了一次中耕追肥。
    培育冬作物的另一特点是，各地大搞高产田，做到少种多收。据湘潭、邵阳两专区的统计，已种高产田一百五十多万亩，一般高产田约占冬作物面积15％。
    据新华社成都25日电　四川省小麦大都开始出苗，油菜生长茁壮。各地人民公社正紧张地进行追肥、灌水、匀苗、治虫。
    资中、安岳、荣县等县组织了四十多万人的田间管理专业队伍，建立和实行了“三锄草，四追肥”以及“四无”（无三类苗、无杂草、无病虫害、无牲畜践踏）、“五定”（定人、定时、定肥、定质、定产）等田间管理制度和责任制。简阳县许多公社都建立了小春管理技术研究站、研究组和技术传授组织。今年小春作物种的深又密，供应充足的水和肥就成为当前田间管理中的突出问题。达县专区最近十天就为此突击积肥。平昌县在“污泥上坡、肥料出棚、粪坑翻身、土地烤火”的口号下，也开展了积肥运动。各地人民公社还在大办土化肥厂，并加紧赶制提水工具。
    今年四川各地党委在紧张的播种刚一结束，就加强了对田间管理工作的领导。南充、内江等专区许多地委、县委书记都深入农村及时了解田间管理情况，发现问题，研究措施。由于不少农民长期以来存在着“重种轻管”的习惯，各地都加强了政治思想工作，教育群众树立“种好加管好才能大丰收”的思想。南部县大王公社完成播种后，有些人就自满松劲，认为种的好，不想出工管理。社里当即展开了“种的好是不是就到手了”的辩论。社员们列举许多过去种好管不好因而减收的事实，批判了这种思想，同时提出今年更要加强田间管理，因为要彻底贯彻农业生产的八字“宪法”，就要认真执行各种先进措施。这样，全社田间管理很快就进入高潮。
