　　Kishi Nobusuke Revisits the Six Codes
　　Wan Feng

　　According to Japan's "Asahi Shimbun," just as Kishi Nobusuke is using every means to revive the police state, a certain type of book has suddenly become a coveted "rare commodity" in Tokyo's used bookstore stalls. This is the pre-war Japanese Six Codes.

　　Since the defeat of Japanese imperialism in 1945, the pre-war militarist police state system has been destroyed. The Six Codes, which were regarded as sacred codes before the war, have long been regarded as worthless and ignored. Even newspaper offices, which have always been known for cherishing materials, mostly discarded them as waste paper; it is even rare to find a few copies on the dusty shelves of used bookstores. No wonder that after people suddenly kept asking about them recently, something that was almost waste paper became a hot commodity overnight. The price of the old Six Codes has soared, from 3.20 yen before the war to 1,100 yen.

　　Those searching for this "antique" include bureaucrats from the Kishi Nobusuke government, members of the Diet, and commentators. For the likes of Kishi Nobusuke, who inherited Tojo's mantle, this old Six Codes has become a model for him to revive the police state and create various reactionary bills.

　　Judging from some of the legal amendments proposed by the Kishi Nobusuke government, they are simply the same as the old laws that read "The ×× Law, co-sponsored by the Imperial Diet, is hereby promulgated in accordance with the resolution." For example, the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" recently submitted to the Diet by the Kishi Nobusuke government has many similarities to the already abolished pre-war Administrative Execution Law, Summary Decree on Violation of Police Regulations, Public Order Police Law, Public Security Preservation Law, and Provisional Regulations on the Control of Speech, Assembly, Association, etc. The anti-espionage bill pushed by the Kishi Nobusuke government also follows the same line as the pre-war Military Secrets Protection Law, National Defense Security Law, and National General Mobilization Law.

　　The difference is that times have changed, and Japan today is not what it was in the days of the Tojo cabinet that Kishi Nobusuke joined. Kishi Nobusuke did not dare to copy the old Six Codes verbatim, but could only play a trick of stealing the sky and changing the day, and copying the book in disguise. For example, the terms "peace and order" and "restraint" used in the pre-war Japanese Police Law have become "public safety and order" and "deterrence" in Kishi Nobusuke's writing. However, no matter how much effort Kishi Nobusuke puts in, a few words can never cover up his conspiracy to revive the police state. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" also said that this "essentially has the danger of restoring the Public Order Police Law and the Public Security Preservation Law."

　　Although there are not many old Six Codes left today, the broad masses of the Japanese people do not need to look through the Six Codes to see through Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracy to revive the fascist police state. Because the scars left by the former fascist dark rule on the people's hearts are too deep. Therefore, as soon as Kishi Nobusuke proposed to amend the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" and formulate other reactionary bills, he fell into a situation of universal condemnation. People from all walks of life in Japan, based on their own painful experiences, have accused the bloody and terrifying dark rule of the old Six Codes era, and angrily accused Kishi Nobusuke of dragging the Japanese people back to the terrifying days of fascist police rule. Japanese writer Wataru Kajii said it well: Kishi Nobusuke's perverse actions "show his war criminal cabinet's nature. Now it seems that the neighboring country of China's accusation that the Kishi Nobusuke government holds potential imperialist ambitions is becoming increasingly clear. The Kishi Nobusuke government wants to revive the era of the pre-war Public Security Preservation Law, and create a police state of the Liberal Democratic Party dictatorship to pave the way for war." Hiroshi Suekawa, president of Ritsumeikan University, pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's expansion of police power under the banner of maintaining "public safety and order" is no different from the pre-war Japanese militarists' use of reactionary bills such as the Public Order Police Law and the Public Security Preservation Law to place the people in bloody terror under the beautiful name of "peace and order." Shinobu Tabata, a professor at Doshisha University in Japan, even more severely accused Kishi Nobusuke of conspiring to revive the police state, explaining that Kishi Nobusuke "is following Hitler's path." The hysterical cries of the police and the clanging of police swords are still echoing in the ears of the Japanese people. The Japanese people will never allow Kishi Nobusuke to drag them back to the era of the old Six Codes.

　　The old Six Codes can enter the used bookstore stalls, so how can Kishi's new Six Codes not share the same fate? Kishi Nobusuke and his ilk should learn this lesson well from the old Six Codes. (Attached picture) Originally published in the Japanese "Akahata"

### 岸信介重温六法全书

    岸信介重温六法全书
    万峰
    据日本“朝日新闻”报道，正当岸信介不择手段地要复活警察国家的时候，东京旧书摊上有这么一种书骤然间变成了可居的“奇货”。这就是战前的日本六法全书。
    自从1945年日本帝国主义战败以后，战前的那一套军国主义警察国家体制已遭到摧毁。战前被目为神圣法典的六法全书，人们早已视如粪土不加理睬了。就是一向以珍惜资料闻名的报馆，大多也把它当作废纸丢掉了；甚至在旧书摊封尘的架子上也难得见到几本。这就无怪近来突然不断有人问津后，几乎是废纸的东西，一朝成了快货。旧六法全书的价格扶摇直上，由战前三元两毛日元，涨到一千一百日元了。
    搜索这种“古董”的，有岸信介政府的官僚，有国会议员，也有评论家。而对于继承东条衣钵的岸信介之流，这部旧六法全书成了他复活警察国家、制造各种反动法案的范本了。
    从岸信介政府提出的一些法律的修正案来看，简直和旧法中所云“经帝国议会协赞之××法，联兹依议，特予公布之”如出一辙。譬如，最近岸信介政府向国会提出的“警察官职务执行法修正案”，就同已经废除的战前的行政执行法、违警罪即决法令、治安警察法、治安维持法、言论集会结社等临时取缔法等旧法有许多相似之处。岸信介政府搞的防谍法案，也同战前的军机保护法、国防保安法、国家总动员法等旧法一脉相承。
    所不同者，时代变了，今天的日本究竟不比岸信介当年入班的东条内阁时代。岸信介没有敢于照抄旧六法全书，而只能玩弄一套偷天换日的把戏，变相地抄书。例如，战前日本警察法案中所用的“安宁秩序”、“检束”一类的用语，到了岸信介笔下就变成“公共安全和秩序”、“制止”一类的字眼了。但是，不管岸信介呕了多少心血，几个字眼绝对掩盖不了他复活警察国家的阴谋。日本的资产阶级报纸“朝日新闻”也说，这“实质上有恢复治安警察法、治安维持法的危险”了。
    今天旧六法全书虽然存者不多，但是广大的日本人民却无需翻看六法全书，就可以识破岸信介复活法西斯警察国家的阴谋。因为从前的法西斯的黑暗统治在人民的心头留下的伤痕是太深了。所以，岸信介一提出要修改“警察官职务执行法”和制定其它反动法案，就陷入了千夫所指的境地。日本各阶层的人民，根据切身的痛苦体验，纷纷控诉旧六法全书时代血腥恐怖的黑暗统治，并且怒不可遏地指责岸信介要把日本人民拖回当年法西斯警察统治的恐怖日子。日本作家鹿地亘说得好：岸信介这种倒行逆施的作法“表明了他的战犯内阁的本性。现在看来，邻邦中国指责岸信介政府持有潜在的帝国主义野心，是越来越清楚了。岸信介政府是要使战前治安维持法的时代复活，搞起一个自由民主党独裁的警察国家，为战争开辟道路。”日本立命馆大学学长末川博指出：岸信介打着维护“公共安全和秩序”的招牌来扩大警察的权力，是和战前日本军国主义者在“安宁秩序”的美名下，用治安警察法和治安维持法等反动法案为手段把人民置于血腥恐怖之中，毫无二致。日本同志社大学教授田畑忍，更严厉地指责岸信介复活警察国家的阴谋，说明岸信介“是在走希特勒的道路”。当年警察的歇斯底里的狂叫声、警刀的咔嚓声，还在日本人民的耳畔回荡着。日本人民绝不容许岸信介把他们拖回到旧六法全书的时代。
    旧六法全书能够进旧书摊，岸记的新六法全书又怎能不共其命运呢？岸信介之流倒是应该好好从旧六法全书上温习一下这个教训。（附图片）	原载日本“赤旗报”
