Xinhua News Agency report: The leap forward in the work of breeding fine breeds of sheep in various regions is very rapid. By the end of October, the number of ewes bred with fine breeds through crossbreeding across the country had greatly exceeded the total number of crossbreedings during the first Five-Year Plan period. The winter mating work of sheep in various regions has also begun intensively.

The universal leap forward situation in sheep improvement work emerged after the Ministry of Agriculture held an on-site meeting on sheep breeding and improvement work in Aohan Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in July. Through the promotion of the meeting, the sheep improvement work in various regions across the country has undergone tremendous development. By the end of October, according to incomplete statistics from fourteen provinces and regions, including Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Shanxi, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, in the autumn season alone, six million ewes had been bred with fine breeds of rams such as Xinjiang fine-wool sheep and Soviet Merino, Caucasian, and Askanian sheep through crossbreeding. This number is more than 1.4 times the number of ewes bred with fine breeds through crossbreeding throughout the country in 1957 and is equivalent to the total number of fine breed crossbred ewes in the six years from 1952 to 1957. Many counties with basically improved sheep breeds have also emerged in various regions. For example, in sixteen counties in Shanxi Province, including Shouyang, Fanshi, Jiaocheng, Zuoyun, Wuxiang, and Anze, there are more than 380,000 ewes of breeding age. By the beginning of October, more than 320,000 had been bred with fine breed rams through crossbreeding, accounting for 84% of the number of ewes of breeding age. In Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, the proportion of fine breed crossbred ewes reached over 90%.

Vigorously developing artificial insemination breeding of sheep is a crucial key to the enormous development of sheep improvement work. Under the leadership of the Party, all regions have formulated plans for sheep improvement work, newly built many sheep artificial insemination stations (points), and trained a large number of artificial insemination technicians. Once the breeding season arrived, various regions launched intensive artificial insemination breeding work. Many artificial insemination technicians have fully exerted the spirit of daring to think and act, improved their skills, and achieved great results. In the Wuhua Artificial Insemination Station in Shangdu County, Hebei, one ram has already bred more than 11,000 ewes, with a conception rate of over 98%.

Currently, the autumn mating of sheep in agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas has basically ended, and the winter mating work in pastoral areas has just begun. In order to promote sheep improvement work during the winter mating, the Ministry of Agriculture recently held a telephone conference attended by responsible agricultural and animal husbandry cadres from fourteen provinces and regions, requiring pastoral areas to firmly grasp the winter mating of sheep and push the sheep improvement movement to a new climax. The meeting demanded that areas where the autumn mating work has ended must not only earnestly conduct pregnancy checks and supplementary mating, ensuring that no ewe goes through the winter without conceiving, but also organize manpower, equipment, and rams to support winter mating areas. For ewes that are already pregnant, efforts should be strengthened to protect the pregnancy, and preparations should be made for lambing, ensuring that no ewe aborts or dies, striving for "one lamb per ewe" and "multiple twins."

### 抓紧绵羊冬配工作  把繁殖良种绵羊运动推向高潮

    抓紧绵羊冬配工作
    把繁殖良种绵羊运动推向高潮
    据新华社讯　各地繁殖良种绵羊工作跃进很快。到10月底，全国各地用良种杂交配种的母羊已经大大超过第一个五年计划期间杂交配种的总和。各地绵羊冬配工作又已紧张展开。
    绵羊改良工作的普遍跃进局面，是农业部7月间在内蒙古自治区的敖汉旗召开绵羊繁殖改良工作现场会议以后出现的。通过会议的推动，全国各地绵羊改良工作都有了巨大发展。到10月底，仅据内蒙古、新疆、甘肃、青海、山西、河北、陕西、山东、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、四川、云南、贵州等十四个省、区的不完全统计，只秋季一季已用新疆细毛羊和苏联美利奴、高加索、阿斯卡尼亚等优良种公羊配种杂交母羊六百万只。这个数字，比1957年全国全年用良种杂交配种的母羊增加了一点四倍多，相当于1952年到1957年六年中良种杂交母羊的总和。各地还出现了不少绵羊基本良种化的县。如山西省寿阳、繁峙、交城、左云、武乡、安泽等十六个县共有适龄母羊三十八万多只，到10月初使用优良种公羊配种杂交的已达三十二万多只，占适龄母羊数84％。河北省张北县良种杂交母羊达到了90％以上。
    大搞绵羊人工授精配种，是绵羊改良工作获得巨大发展的重要关键。在党的领导下，各地对绵羊改良工作都作了规划，新建了很多绵羊人工授精站（点），训练了大批人工授精员，配种季节一到，各地就展开了紧张的人工授精配种工作。很多人工授精员充分地发挥了敢想敢作的精神，提高技术，获得了很大成就。河北商都县五花人工授精站一只种公羊已配母羊一万一千多只，受胎率也达98％以上。
    当前，农业区和半农半牧区的绵羊秋季配种已经基本结束，牧业区的冬配工作刚刚开始。为了推动冬配中的绵羊改良工作，农业部在最近召开了一次有十四个省、区农牧业负责干部参加的电话会议上，要求牧区要狠狠抓紧绵羊冬配，把绵羊改良运动推向一个新的高潮。会议要求秋配工作已经结束的地区，除必须切实进行查胎补配，不让一头母羊空怀过冬外，还要很好地组织人力、器材和种公羊支援冬配地区。对于已经怀胎的母羊，要加强保胎工作，并且要做好接羔准备，要保证做到一头不流产不死亡，力争“百母百羔”和“多产双羔”。
