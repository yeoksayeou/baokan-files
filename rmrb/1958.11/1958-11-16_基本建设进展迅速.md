This newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch: The basic construction projects in Gansu Province this year are progressing rapidly. By the end of October, 81% of the annual construction plan had been completed. It is expected that this year's construction plan can be overfulfilled.

There are more than 300 construction projects in the province this year, which is larger in scale than any previous year. One hundred and five projects have already been completed and put into production, and another 100 projects will be basically completed before the end of the year. These include large-scale oil refineries, chemical plants, and thermal power plants, some of which were originally planned to be completed next year, and some even in the year after that. The Lanzhou Cotton Textile Factory, which was constructed in only 180 days, has already produced yarn and cloth ahead of schedule. The electrolytic aluminum plant, which started construction in August, is now taking shape.

    基本建设进展迅速
    本报兰州讯　甘肃省今年的基本建设工程进展迅速，到10月底止，已经完成全年施工计划的81％，预计今年度施工计划可以超额完成。
    全省今年的建设项目共有三百多个，规模比以往任何一年都大。现在已经有一百零五个项目建成投入生产，年底以前还将有一百个项目基本建成。这里有规模巨大的炼油厂、化工厂和热电站，有的原来计划要到明年建成，甚至还有原来要在后年才能建成的。只施工一百八十天的兰州棉纺织厂，已经提前出纱出布，8月份开始施工的电解铝厂，现在已见雏型。
