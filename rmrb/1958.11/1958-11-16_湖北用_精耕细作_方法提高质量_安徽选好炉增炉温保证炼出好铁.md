Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th. In the great steelmaking movement, Anhui Province has not only seen a continuous increase in pig iron production but also good quality, with the vast majority meeting standards. This pig iron has been used within the province to produce good steel, which has been used to make a large number of mechanical equipment and various agricultural tools with good performance. The units using the pig iron sent to support steelmaking in Shanghai and other places have also expressed satisfaction.

More than 80% of the pig iron produced in Anhui Province this year has come from small blast furnaces of 1.5 cubic meters or more and small indigenous furnaces in the Dabie Mountains. The iron produced by these furnaces is of very good quality. For example, the iron produced by the 8 cubic meter and larger small blast furnaces of the Provincial Party Committee Organ Steel Plant (experimental field), the Hefei Municipal Party Committee Steel Plant, the Hefei Mining Machinery Plant, the Public Transportation Company, and other units has been tested and meets the requirements for steelmaking and casting. The quality of pig iron produced in the Dabie Mountains, where the most pig iron is produced by small indigenous furnaces, is also very good. According to tests, the iron content is about 95%, the sulfur content is 0.2% to 0.5%, the phosphorus content is 0.02% to 0.07%, the silicon content is 0.2% to 0.4%, and the carbon content is 0.02% to 0.05%, which also meets the national requirements for pig iron quality.

The main reason for the good quality of Anhui's pig iron is that the Provincial Party Committee emphasized from the beginning that while increasing pig iron production, it was also necessary to improve pig iron quality. This spirit has been implemented in practical work. Generally, the pig iron smelted in various places does not have sintered iron. Once sintered iron is found in individual places, it is pointed out and corrected. The Provincial Metallurgical Headquarters also stipulates that sintered iron shall not be included in the output calculation. When responsible cadres of the Provincial Party Committee inspect steel production in various places, they personally inspect it. If it does not meet the specifications, the iron must be returned to the furnace for re-smelting. Once, a unit from another province came to Wu Hu Prefecture and Tongguan Mountain to transfer iron. Some of the pig iron did not meet the specifications. Although the people who transferred the iron wanted it, the province did not allow it to be transferred out in order to avoid the waste of transportation capacity and to ensure the quality of steelmaking in other places.

Anhui Province stipulates that good furnace types must be selected for iron smelting to ensure high iron output, good iron quality, low coal consumption, and labor savings. This has enabled various places to establish the idea of attaching importance to both quantity and quality, and to implement the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. In addition, the province has trained a large number of laboratory personnel, and there are people in charge of testing the composition of pig iron, ore, coke, and slag at various iron smelting positions. Many places also have dedicated personnel to fix the ratio of ingredients, so that the iron output of the iron smelting furnace is both high and good. Various places also generally attach importance to increasing the furnace temperature. Most small furnaces are equipped with hot blast stoves, which turn cold air into hot air to ensure the production of good iron. (Photo attached)

### 湖北用“精耕细作”方法提高质量  安徽选好炉增炉温保证炼出好铁

    湖北用“精耕细作”方法提高质量
    安徽选好炉增炉温保证炼出好铁
    新华社合肥15日电　安徽省在大炼钢铁运动中，不但生铁产量不断上升，而且质量也好，绝大部分合乎标准。这些生铁在本省炼出了好钢，制成了大批性能良好的机械设备和各种农具，调出支援上海等地炼钢的，使用单位也表示满意。
    安徽省今年已产的生铁，有80％以上是一点五立方公尺以上小高炉和大别山区小土炉生产的。这些炉子产的铁质量都很好。如省委机关钢铁厂（试验田）、合肥市委钢铁厂、合肥矿山机械厂、公共汽车公司等单位八立方公尺以上小高炉所产的铁，经过化验，都符合炼钢和铸造要求；用小土炉产铁量最多的大别山区各县，炼出的生铁质量也很好，据化验，这种铁含铁量在95％左右，含硫0.2％到0.5％，含磷0.02％到0.07％，含矽0.2％到0.4％，含炭0.02％到0.05％，也符合国家对生铁质量的要求。
    安徽生铁质量好的主要原因，是省委一开始就强调在提高生铁产量的同时，还要提高生铁质量。实际工作一直贯彻了这个精神。各地炼出的生铁一般都没有烧结铁，一旦发现个别地方有烧结铁，就指出纠正。省冶金指挥部并规定烧结铁一律不计算产量。省委负责干部到各地视察钢铁生产时，都亲自检验，凡是不合规格的，都要各地回炉重炼。有一次外地到芜湖专区和铜官山调铁，有些生铁质量不合规格，调铁的人虽然要，但省里为了避免运输力的浪费和保证外地炼钢质量，也不让调出。
    安徽省规定炼铁必须选择好的炉型，以保证出铁多，出铁好，耗煤少，节省劳动力。这就使得各地树立起既重视数量又重视质量的思想，贯彻多快好省的要求。另外，全省培训了大批的化验人员，在各个炼铁阵地上都有人在负责化验生铁、矿石、焦炭、炉渣的成分。许多地方并固定专人配料，使得炼铁炉出铁既多又好。各地还普遍重视提高炉温，大部分小炉都装了热风炉，使冷风变成热风，保证出好铁。（附图片）
