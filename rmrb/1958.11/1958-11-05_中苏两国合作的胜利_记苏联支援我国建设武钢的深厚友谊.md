The Victory of Sino-Soviet Cooperation
——Remembering the Profound Friendship of the Soviet Union in Supporting the Construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works in China

On the day when the No. 1 blast furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works (WISCO) was put into operation, the head of the Soviet expert team, Badulov, reported to Chairman Mao: "The imperialists said that our Wuhan Iron and Steel Works would not be able to produce iron in 1958, but we are producing iron today. This is a victory." Chairman Mao replied: "This is a victory of Sino-Soviet cooperation." Chairman Mao's words made the builders of WISCO think far ahead, reminding them that they had received friendly assistance from the Soviet Union every time they encountered difficulties.

As early as the beginning of 1952, when China was arranging long-term construction plans, the Soviet government, at China's invitation, sent an expert team headed by Comrade Khlebnikov, the former Deputy Minister of Heavy Industry. In that season of early spring chill, rain, and snow, they traversed the fields, hills, mines, and caves around Huangshi and Daye, comprehensively considering political, economic, and technical conditions, and proposed the construction of a steel base with a scale of more than two million tons near the Daye Iron Mine. Based on this suggestion, the original Central Finance and Economics Committee drafted a plan to build the Central China Steel Company into a huge iron and steel complex.

On March 15, 1952, Chairman Mao approved this plan. In 1953, the Soviet Union and China signed an agreement to help build this iron and steel complex.

Building such a large iron and steel base from scratch was a first for China, and many difficulties were encountered from the beginning.

First, in the Jianlinshan section of the Daye mining area, a large area of exposed iron ore suddenly stopped. For decades, geologists from the United States, Britain, Japan, and France had come here to investigate, but they could never figure out whether there was ore here. They called this place the "incomprehensible fault." Was there any ore here after all? When the 429 Geological Exploration Team took on this task, Soviet geologist Krotki came to Daye Iron Mountain in the scorching heat of July. After observing various mountains and studying various data, he suggested that surveying, geophysical prospecting, geology, and drilling work should be closely coordinated, and deep drilling should be carried out in Jianlinshan. Thus, two heavy drilling rigs began drilling. When the exploration team drilled more than 223 meters, it discovered iron ore in this "incomprehensible fault." Subsequently, a second layer of iron ore was found deep in Tieshan, and numerous mineral deposits were found in the vicinity for tens of miles, preparing resources for the first phase of production of the new steel base.

Similarly, due to lack of experience, the Central China Steel Company spent more than two years pre-selecting twenty-three factory sites in an area of hundreds of miles and made three comparison plans, but each had serious shortcomings. Twenty-seven experts, led by Belyakov, the dean of the Soviet Metallurgical Plant Design Institute, conducted a careful exploration and repeatedly deliberated various conditions such as topography, geology, soil bearing capacity, water sources, and transportation with Chinese comrades, and finally found the current factory site with excellent conditions in the Wuhan area. The Central China Steel Company was also renamed Wuhan Iron and Steel Company from then on.

Wuhan is one of China's famous "three furnaces," and the summer is extremely hot, with temperatures reaching 38 to 42 degrees Celsius. In order to solve the problem of heatstroke prevention in high-temperature steel production, Soviet labor protection experts Lezhakov and Krazhdankin went to Chongqing, Huangshi, and Shanghai in the scorching heat to experience life next to the searing steelmaking furnaces, and at the same time solicited workers' opinions; the young hydrogeologist Irina, stepping on one or two feet of snow in winter, found an underground water source for cooling WISCO.

Subsequently, many design institutes, led by the Leningrad branch of the Soviet Black Metallurgical Design Institute, launched a vast design work for WISCO. They tried their best to adopt the latest technology in the design, making WISCO a world-class steel plant. The No. 4 blast furnace of the British Wells Company, known as "the largest blast furnace in Western Europe," only produces 1,500 tons of iron per day, while WISCO's No. 1 blast furnace produces 2,000 to 2,500 tons of iron per day. The world's largest open-hearth furnace produces 500 tons of steel per furnace, and WISCO will have many such open-hearth furnaces. These equipments are also highly automated. For example, the already-built No. 1 blast furnace uses belt conveyors operated from a distance to transport all the 6,000 to 7,000 tons of raw materials needed every day, and from the top of the furnace, all the batching, charging, and smelting are automatically controlled, ensuring that the blast furnace can achieve the highest output and the most advanced utilization coefficient.

The Soviet Design Institute also paid great attention to the rational layout of production and the full utilization of resources. They arranged the factory area according to the flow process, so that WISCO, an iron and steel complex with tens of millions of tons of products per year, has a factory area of only five square kilometers. In this way, every kilometer of railway shortened can save millions of tons of kilometers of transportation costs every year. They also tried to select copper from the iron ore, which is more valuable than all the iron ore.

At the beginning of this year, China's industrial and agricultural production made a great leap forward, and the builders of WISCO put forward the slogan of "doubling the construction period, halving the investment, and doubling the output," and decided to put various projects into production ahead of schedule. At that time, the most prominent issue was the supply of equipment. Among them, the most complex equipment ordered from the Soviet Union, although the Soviet side had already arranged production plans, in order to allow WISCO to put into production as soon as possible, the relevant departments of the Soviet government organized more than 200 electromechanical factories to rush to manufacture for WISCO. Many factories launched labor competitions to rush to manufacture equipment for WISCO. Originally, there were two sets of 14-meter-long large bell drawbars for the blast furnace, which WISCO had not ordered in advance, but the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant temporarily undertook them and rushed to manufacture them in July. The two 40-ton weighing cars needed by WISCO were also new products trial-produced at the Odessa Weighing Car Factory. The original agreement was to deliver one each at the end of this year and the beginning of next year, but they tried their best to overcome difficulties and rushed to manufacture the first one in early August.

The great leap forward of WISCO made many types of work enter the peak of construction in July and August. Eighteen Soviet experts refused their summer vacations at this time and insisted on working with the workers on the hot construction site day and night. Frizhlekov, a tall furnace-building expert, squatted in a 1.2-meter enclosure pipe every day, and drilled into the enclosure pipe with the workers to work overtime at night. A few days before each project was put into production, the relevant Soviet experts stayed on the construction site day and night. Badulov, the head of the expert team in his sixties who had won five medals in the Soviet Union, also often went to the construction site late at night to check the work.

With the selfless help of the Soviet Union, more than 40% of WISCO's projects have been completed. The No. 1 coking furnace was put into production first in August, followed by the No. 1 blast furnace in September, and the No. 2 coking furnace in October. In the future, many major projects will be put into production. (Attached picture)

    中苏两国合作的胜利
    ——记苏联支援我国建设武钢的深厚友谊
    新华社记者  曹葆铭
    在武钢一号高炉开炉出铁那天，苏联专家组长巴杜洛夫向毛主席汇报说：“帝国主义说我们武钢这个高炉1958年出不了铁，但我们今天就出铁了，这是一个胜利。”毛主席回答说：“这是中苏两国合作的胜利。”毛主席这句话使武钢建设者们想的很远，想到他们在每次遇到困难的时候，都得到苏联的友谊援助。
    远在1952年年初，当我国安排长远建设规划的时候，苏联政府应我国的邀请，派来了以原重工业部副部长郝列布尼可夫为首的专家组。他们在那春寒料峭、雨雪交加的季节里，踏遍了黄石、大冶一带的田野、山岗和矿井、岩洞，全面地从政治、经济、技术等条件作了考虑，提出了可以在大冶铁矿附近建设一个规模在二百万吨以上的钢铁基地的建议。根据这个建议，原中央财政经济委员会拟出了将华中钢铁公司建成巨大的钢铁联合企业的计划。
    1952年3月15日，毛主席批准了这个计划。1953年，苏联就和我国订立了帮助建设这个钢铁联合企业的协议。
    从平地建起这大的钢铁基地，在我国还是第一次，一开始就遇到很多困难。
    首先是在大冶矿区的尖林山地段上，大片露出地面的铁矿，突然中断了。几十年来，美国、英国、日本、法国的地质学家都来这里作过调查，始终弄不清这里有没有矿，他们把这里叫做“不可理解的断层”。到底这里有没有矿呢？当四二九地质勘探队承担起这个任务的时候，苏联地质学家克罗特基冒着7月的盛暑来到大冶铁山，他在观察了各个山脉和研究各种资料之后，建议测绘、物理探矿、地质、钻探等工作密切配合，在尖林山打深钻。这样，两架重型钻机开始钻探了，当勘探队钻到二百二十三公尺多的时候，就在这“不可理解的断层”发现了铁矿。接着，又在铁山深处查出了第二层铁矿，在附近几十里查出了许许多多的矿藏，为新的钢铁基地的第一期生产准备了资源。
    同样因为没有经验的原故，华中钢铁公司花了两年多时间，在纵横数百里的地区里，预选了二十三个厂址，并作出了三个比较方案，但每个都有严重的缺点。以苏联冶金工厂设计院院长别良可夫为首的二十七位专家，又进行认真的勘查，对地形、地质、土壤耐压力、水源、交通等各种条件和中国的同志们一起反复推敲，最后在武汉地区找到现在的这个条件优良的厂址。华中钢铁公司也从此更名为武汉钢铁公司。
    武汉地区是我国著名的“三大火炉”之一，夏季酷热，温度高达摄氏三十八到四十二度。为了解决钢铁高温生产的防暑问题，苏联劳动保护专家雷夏可夫和克拉日丹金，专门在酷暑中去重庆、黄石和上海，在灼人的炼钢炉旁体验生活，同时征求工人们的意见；年轻的水文地质专家伊丽娜在冬天踏着一二尺深的积雪，为武钢找到了降温的地下水源。
    接着，以苏联黑色冶金设计院列宁格勒分院为主的许多设计院，为武钢展开了浩繁的设计工作。他们在设计中尽量采用了最新的技术，使武钢成为世界第一流的钢铁厂。被称为“西欧最大的高炉”的英国威尔思公司四号高炉只不过日产一千五百吨铁，而武钢的一号高炉是日产二千至二千五百吨铁。世界上最大的平炉是炉产五百吨钢，而武钢就将拥有多座这样的平炉。这些设备又都是高度自动化的。像已经建成的一号高炉，每天需用的六七千吨原料全用远距离操纵的皮带机运送，并且从炉顶开始，无论配料、上料和冶炼，全部是自动控制，保证高炉能达到最高的产量和最先进的利用系数。
    苏联设计院还非常注意生产的合理布置和资源的充分利用。他们根据流水作业过程来安排厂区，使武钢这样一个每年有上千万吨产品的钢铁联合企业，厂区只有五平方公里。这样每缩短一公里的铁路，每年就能减省数百万吨公里的运输费用。他们还设法选出铁矿中的铜来，这些铜比全部铁矿的价值还高。
    今年年初，我国工农业生产大跃进，武钢建设者们提出了“工期快一倍，投资省一半，产量翻一番”的口号，决定将各项工程提前投入生产。当时最突出的是设备供应问题。其中一小部分向苏联订货的最复杂的设备，虽然苏联方面早已安排了生产计划，但是为了让武钢早日投入生产，苏联政府有关部门组织了两百多个机电工厂为武钢赶制。许多工厂为给武钢赶制设备展开了劳动竞赛。本来，有两套十四公尺长的高炉大钟拉杆，武钢事前没有订货，但乌拉尔重型机器厂临时承担下来，并且在7月就赶制出来了。武钢需用的两台四十吨秤量车，在敖德萨秤量车厂也是试制的新产品，原协议在今年年底和明年年初各交一台，但是他们想尽办法克服困难，在8月初就赶制出第一台来。
    武钢的大跃进，使许多工种都在7、8月里进入施工高峰。十八位苏联专家，这时都拒绝了暑期休假，不分昼夜地跟工人们一起坚持在酷热的工地上。一位身材高大的筑炉专家弗日列科夫，每天都蹲在一公尺二的围管里工作，夜里又钻进围管同工人们一起加班，在每项工程投入生产的前几天，有关的苏联专家更是日夜不离工地。在苏联获得了五个勋章的六十多岁的专家组长巴杜洛夫，也经常深夜到工地检查工作。
    在苏联无私的帮助下，武钢的工程已经完成了40％以上。一号焦炉最先在8月投入了生产，紧接着一号高炉在9月投入了生产，二号焦炉又在10月投入了生产，今后还将有许多重大工程投入生产。（附图片）
