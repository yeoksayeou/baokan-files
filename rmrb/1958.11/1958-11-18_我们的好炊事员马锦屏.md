    Our Good Cook, Ma Jinping
   By our reporter Zhang Wei
    After the establishment of the Chengguan People's Commune in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, it was difficult to find cooks for the canteens. The women said, having spent decades revolving around the stove, who would want to wash dishes and cook again now that they had the opportunity to participate in production? At this time, a young woman came forward and volunteered, "I will be the cook."
    This person is Ma Jinping, only twenty-three years old this year, and the wife of a worker. When everyone was discussing setting up the canteen, she said, "Everything is for serving the people. One person cooks for many people to eat; one person becomes a cook, letting many people be free to engage in production, how glorious is that!"
    The canteen opened on September 1st. The commune members considered many issues: what to do if someone is sick and needs to eat? What to do if the elderly can't chew? What to do if guests come? etc., all afraid that the canteen would not be satisfactory. Ma Jinping, with the determination to " wholeheartedly run the canteen well," thought of many ways. Aunt Gao's family of five all have stomach problems and need to eat soft rice; Luo Xiuying's family, however, is used to eating hard rice... Every time Ma Jinping steamed rice, she added rice and water separately according to the marks she had made on their rice bowls in advance. For the elderly and children, she prepared porridge and pasta separately for each meal. She also thought of making preserved tofu, dried tofu sheets, and salted radish, and buying shrimp, fish, and eggs for dishes, so each meal maintained four or five dishes. In the beginning, some commune members complained that the dishes were too salty or too bland, and some complained that there was too little oil, etc. When the commune members expressed these opinions, she always listened patiently. Gradually, she became familiar with people's tastes, and the food she made became very delicious, and everyone often rushed to buy the dishes she made.
    To make it convenient for the commune members, Ma Jinping did not mechanically enforce the meal times. She often left the food in the steamer for the commune members, so that those commune members and students who did not arrive at the canteen on time could eat hot meals at any time. Therefore, this canteen was always open from nine o'clock in the morning until twelve o'clock, and from four o'clock in the afternoon until the lights were turned on. In late September, there were several days of continuous rain, and the weather suddenly turned cold. Ma Jinping asked the lonely old woman, Grandma Yuan, who was over seventy years old, what difficulties she had in eating. Grandma Yuan sighed and said, "There are no other difficulties, just that the road is difficult to walk when it rains." Ma Jinping immediately said, "Then I will deliver it to you." Then, on rainy days, she delivered food and water to Grandma Yuan. From then on, she personally delivered food to people's homes whenever she found someone was sick or had special difficulties.
    Ma Jinping paid great attention to the cleanliness and hygiene of the canteen. She numbered the chopsticks of sick people and inserted them in a row in paper bags on the wall. The bowls and chopsticks of ordinary people were also disinfected at every meal. The local people used to drink river water, which was very unhygienic. She tried her best to use well water, and also used bleaching powder to disinfect the drinking water. Although the conditions of the canteen were very simple, it was clean everywhere and there were no flies.
    Since Ma Jinping became a cook, she has gotten up every day before dawn to send her child to the nursery, and has devoted her entire day to the canteen until she finishes clearing the accounts and takes her child home at night, without any complaints.
    After the news that this canteen was well-run spread, the number of people eating in the canteen suddenly increased from forty-two to one hundred and seventy-four. The commune members generally reflected, "Ma Jinping is our good cook." All the cooks in the commune learned from her and posted big-character posters to praise her. Now, there are already thirty-five canteens in the commune that are as well-run as Ma Jinping's canteen.

    我们的好炊事员马锦屏
   本报记者　张碨
    湖北孝感县城关人民公社成立后，一时食堂找不到炊事员。妇女们说，围着锅台转了几十年，现在有机会参加生产，那个还愿意再洗碗做饭？这时一个年轻妇女出来自荐说：“我来当炊事员。”
    这人叫马锦屏，今年才二十三岁，是一个工人的妻子。大家讨论办食堂时，她说：“任何事情都是为人民服务。一人做饭许多人吃；一人当炊事员让许多人撒手去生产，这有多光荣！”
    9月1号食堂开张了。社员们考虑许多问题：病了吃饭怎么办？老人嚼不动怎么办？来了客怎么办？等等，都怕食堂不称心。马锦屏抱着“一心一意搞好食堂”的决心，想了许多办法。高嫂子一家五口人都有胃病，饭要吃软的；罗秀英一家人却习惯吃硬饭……马锦屏每次蒸饭时即按照她预先在这些人的饭钵上做的记号，分别下米放水。对老人和孩子，她每顿饭都另外准备了稀饭和面食。她自己还想法做些霉豆腐、霉千张、咸萝卜，买些虾、鱼、鸡蛋作菜，因此，每顿饭都保持了四、五样菜。开始有些社员喊菜咸了，或喊淡了，有人又嫌油放少了等等。社员在发表这些意见的时候，她总是耐心听着，慢慢地她熟悉了人们的口味，做的味道就很可口了，她做的菜大家常常抢着买。
    马锦屏为便利社员，没有机械执行开饭时间。她经常给社员们把饭菜留在蒸笼里，使那些不同按时来到食堂的社员和学生们，随时吃到热呼呼的饭菜。因此，这个食堂每天上午总是从九点钟开饭一直开到十二点，下午从四点开到上灯。9月下旬有几天阴雨连绵，天气突然变冷。马锦屏便问独居的七十多岁的袁老婆婆吃饭有什么困难。袁老婆婆叹口气说：“别的困难没有，就是下雨路不好走。”马锦屏立即说：“那我给你送去。”接着，她在下雨的日子便给袁老婆婆送饭送水。从此以后，她发现谁病了，谁临时有特殊困难，就亲自把饭菜给送到家里。
    马锦屏很注意食堂的清洁卫生。她给生病人的筷子编号，并排插在墙上的纸袋里，一般人的碗、筷也都餐餐消毒。当地群众原来都吃河里水，很不卫生，她一方面尽量改用井水，一方面还用漂白粉给饮水消毒。食堂的条件虽然很简陋，但是，到处干干净净，没有苍蝇。
    马锦屏自当炊事员以来，天天从不亮起床把孩子送到托儿组，一直到晚上清好账时抱孩子回家为止，把自己整整一天的时间交给了食堂，没有怨言。
    这个食堂办得好的风儿传出去后，参加食堂的人一下子由四十二人增加到一百七十四人。社员们普遍反映：“马锦屏是我们的好炊事员。”全公社的炊事员都向她学习，贴大字报表扬她。现在，公社已有三十五个食堂办得像马锦屏的食堂那样好。
