Discussion on the division of labor between physical and mental labor

    Purely Mental Laborers Will Not Exist in the Future
    Fu Youren
    Wei Gao believes: “In communist society, purely mental labor will still exist.” I believe: “In communist society, purely mental labor will absolutely not exist.”
    To prove the correctness of his argument, Wei Gao mentioned two reasons: first, in order to give people greater roles to play, there should be a division of labor between physical and mental labor; second, there will still be geniuses in communist society, and there is no need to ask geniuses to do work they are not good at, otherwise, geniuses will be buried.
    Let's look at the first reason: It is certain that by the time we reach communist society, science will be highly developed and people's knowledge will be rich. Can we conclude from this that the division of labor between physical and mental labor will still exist, and that purely mental labor will continue to exist? In other words, is it still necessary to have a group of people with big heads and small hands, specializing in theory and scientific research, while the majority of humanity cannot engage in theory, scientific research, or explore the secrets of the universe? Obviously not. People must not allow theoretical "knowledge" to be monopolized by a few privileged individuals.
    For thousands of years, the working masses have labored day and night, repeatedly, not only creating "material wealth" but also creating spiritual wealth. However, under the rule of the exploiting classes, the broad masses of people had no right to education and no freedom to engage in mental labor. Can we allow the vast number of workers to be forever excluded from knowledge, unable to freely study theory or engage in scientific research, while allowing some "geniuses" and "scholars" to peddle their sophistry? Is this reasonable? Is this beneficial to social development?
    Wei Gao's second reason is: "There will still be geniuses in communist society, and there is no need to ask geniuses to do labor they are not good at, hindering their mental development." It seems that "geniuses" can only be people engaged in mental labor, and people engaged in physical labor are not worthy of being "geniuses." Just look at the situation of this year's Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture! Which great scholar created such a miracle? Can't we imagine that once 500 million farmers have mastered theory and knowledge, they can create miracles ten thousand times greater than ours? It's not that they don't have genius, but that they didn't have the right to learn in the past, burying their genius.
    What will communist society be like? By then, the wealth of society will be extremely abundant, and people can get everything they need at any time. At that time, labor will no longer be a means of making a living, but a pleasure. People will no longer need to engage in eight hours of physical labor every day, but six hours, four hours, or even two hours. What will they do with the remaining time? People can freely develop their needs and talents. Everyone will be a theorist, scientist, inventor, writer, singer, and also an ordinary laborer. Will there still be a need for a few people to specialize in purely mental labor at that time? A few people to engage in theory and scientific research? Obviously not. Will anyone be able to not participate in the production of basic materials – food, clothing, and shelter – at that time? Obviously not. At that time, people will have equal access to knowledge, and labor will also be equal. Whoever does not engage in this part of labor will increase the burden on others, which is a shameful thing.

### 单纯的脑力劳动者将来不存在

专栏：关于体力劳动和脑力劳动分工问题的讨论

    单纯的脑力劳动者将来不存在
    富友仁
    魏高认为：“在共产主义社会，单纯的脑力劳动仍然存在。”我认为：“在共产主义社会，单纯的脑力劳动绝不存在。”
    魏高为了证明其论点的正确，提到两点理由：一，为了发挥人们更大的作用，就应该进行体力劳动与脑力劳动的分工；二，共产主义社会仍然会有天才，没有必要叫天才做他不擅长的工作，否则就会埋没了天才。
    我们来看看第一个理由吧：到共产主义社会，科学高度的发展，人们的知识丰富，这一点是肯定的。能不能由此得出结论：体力劳动与脑力劳动仍然分工，单纯的脑力劳动继续存在呢？也就是说，是不是还需要有一部分人头大手小，专门搞理论、搞科学研究，而人类的大多数就不能搞理论、搞科学研究、探讨宇宙的秘密呢？显然不是。人们绝不能允许把理论“知识”垄断在少数特权分子的手里。
    几千年来，劳苦大众夜以继日，重重复复”地劳动，不仅创造了“物质财富，而且创造了精神财富。然而在剥削阶级的统治下，广大人民没有受教育的权利，没有从事脑力劳动的自由。难道我们能允许永远把广大的劳动者排斥在知识之外，不能自由地学理论、搞科学研究，而听任一些“天才”“学者”去卖弄玄虚吗？这是合理的吗？这对社会发展有利吗？
    魏高的第二个理由是：“共产主义社会仍然有天才，没有必要叫天才做他不擅长的劳动，妨碍他们脑力的发展。”看来“天才”只能是从事脑力劳动的人，而从事体力劳动的人不配当“天才”。看一看今年工农业大跃进的情况就很清楚！哪一个大学者创造了这样的奇迹？难道就不能设想一旦五亿农民都掌握了理论，掌握了知识，能创造出比我们高出万倍的奇迹吗？不是他们没有天才，而是过去他们没有学习的权利，埋没了他们的天才。
    共产主义社会将是怎样的呢？到那时社会的财富已极大的丰富了，人们可以随时得到自己的需要的一切，到那时，劳动不再是谋生的手段，而是一种乐趣，人们再也不需要每天从事八小时的体力劳动，而是六小时，四小时，甚至二小时。剩下的时间作什么呢？人们可以自由发展自己的需要和才能。人人都是理论家、科学家、发明家、作家、歌唱家，也都是普通劳动者。那时候还需不需要少数人专门从事单纯的脑力劳动呢？少数人搞理论、科学研究呢？显然不需要。到那时是否有人可以不参加基本物资——衣食住的生产劳动呢？显然没有。那时人们掌握知识的条件是平等的，劳动地位也是平等的，谁不从事这部分劳动，谁就要加重别人的负担，这是可耻的事情。
