Editor's Note: Readers have read many poems by workers, peasants, and soldiers. Today, we recommend some new authors and new poems to you. They come from the kitchen, which we are all familiar with. The cooks of the Qingdao Farm Tool Factory have started a small publication: "Kitchen Literature." Here are some of their works.

	I am a Cook
		I am a cook,
		I cook the fire every day,
		Don't look at my age,
		I have been burning the fire for more than ten years.
		Looking for tricks next to the stove,
		Working hard and grabbing experience;
		Saving coal, saving electricity,
		Supporting the blast furnace to refine steel.
			(Guan Zhenshan)

	First Time Doing Cooking Work
		First time doing cooking work,
		Follow the teacher and do it well,
		Go all out and work harder,
		Provide the staff with enough food,
		Sell meals with a friendly attitude,
		The staff comrades all praise,
		Refine more steel ingots and refine more iron,
		It is not difficult to defeat American imperialism.
			(Cheng Baojian)

	Work Post in the Kitchen
		My work post is in the kitchen,
		Every day I wash rice, wash vegetables, and steam dry food,
		The steamed buns are round and round,
		The millet rice is fragrant,
		Steel warriors eat their fill,
		We will surely win the three battles.
			(Xu Lanying)

	Satellite in the Sky Makes Me Happy
		The vegetables are washed clean without sand,
		So fresh and beautiful,
		Steel warriors eat their fill,
		I am happy when the satellite goes into the sky.
			(Fang Shuyun)

	Wash the Rice Clean
		Wash the rice clean,
		White rice is bouncy,
		Millet rice is also good-looking,
		Comrades eat it,
		Refine steel that is top-notch.
			(Zhao Yuzhen)

	My Task is to Clean
		My task is to clean,
		Wash dishes and bowls to be clean,
		When I have time, I swat flies,
		Eliminate flies to prevent illness.
			(Xie Bingsiu)

	Selling Meals with a Good Attitude
		Selling meals with a good attitude,
		Happy in my heart with a smile on my face,
		I give comrades steamed buns,
		Guarantee that comrades eat their fill.
			(Wang Huiliang)

	Cutting Vegetables Evenly
		Cutting vegetables evenly,
		Making the taste strong,
		Steel warriors eat it,
		Full of energy to refine good steel.
			(Song Meilan)

    编者按：读者们读过不少工人、农民、战士的诗，今天，我们向大家推荐一些新的作者和新的诗篇，它们来自我们都很熟悉的伙房里。青岛农具厂炊事员同志办了一个小刊物：“伙房文艺”。这里是他们一部分作品。我是一个炊事员
  我是一个炊事员，
  每天烧火我来干，
  别看我的年纪大，
  烧火烧了十多年。
  灶炉旁边找窍门，
  苦干猛干抓经验；
  节约煤、节约电，
  支援高炉把钢炼。
        （关振山）
