    The People Love Chairman Mao
    ——Notes from Following Chairman Mao’s Inspection Tour
  　Zhang Zhizhong
    This time, I had the honor of following Chairman Mao on an inspection tour of various places, including Hubei (Wuhan, Echeng, Daye, Huangshi), Anhui (Anqing, Shucheng, Hefei, Wuhu, Ma'anshan), Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places. From September 10th to 29th, lasting nineteen days, I saw and heard many things along the way. I didn't plan to publish anything, but I just want to describe one or two scenes of the sincere and fervent love of the people for Chairman Mao. This is what the broad masses of people love to hear and see. In particular, Taiwan is constantly fabricating lies such as "the people of the mainland are constantly launching anti-communist and anti-tyranny movements." After reading my report, these lies will naturally be self-defeating.
    Now, the people of the whole country firmly believe in and support the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and are willing to follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao forever. And the sincere and fervent love of the people for Chairman Mao is rare in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. This fully proves that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have established an unparalleled lofty faith among the broad masses of people and have won unprecedented support. "Chairman Mao is like the sun, shining brightly wherever he goes." This is absolutely true. Wherever he goes, there is a sensation, a boiling, a carnival. Anyone who wants to describe the people's love for Chairman Mao will definitely feel that their mouths and pens are simply too clumsy. Even using movie cameras and tape recorders, I think it can only express some superficial situations, but how can the people's inner sincere love for their dear leader be described even in the slightest? Here, I can only briefly describe some fragmentary impressions.
    Let's start with Chairman Mao's visit to Wuhan University. It was already dark when we entered the school. After visiting several small factories run by the Chemistry and Physics Departments, we arrived at the square in front of the main building. There, the crowd was densely packed. All 13,000 teachers and students from Wuhan University, the Water Conservancy College, the Surveying College, and the Nationalities Branch College were gathered. As soon as Chairman Mao appeared on the stage, a burst of cheers and applause immediately erupted below. They jumped and shouted to their hearts' content: "Long live!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" constantly came from the crowd, and the sound was like thunder! They must be thinking: What a glorious and happy moment this is! To be able to see their beloved leader.
    Chairman Mao walked from the steps to the rostrum, waving to everyone as he walked, then clapping with everyone, then pacing from this side of the stage to that side, and then from that side to this side. Under the strong gasoline lamps, everyone could see Chairman Mao clearly. More than ten thousand pairs of eyes followed Chairman Mao, and more than ten thousand hearts were beating excitedly. How many people shed tears of excitement! Chairman Mao left in their applause and cheers.
    It is said that the school was a sensation that night. Many people were so excited that they couldn't sleep, and many people were talking all night about this extraordinary meeting. Especially those who shook hands and talked with Chairman Mao told others the experience over and over again, wrote letters to their relatives, and many people ran into the laboratory and factory to hold meetings to discuss and revise the leap forward plan. They were all determined to redouble their efforts to repay Chairman Mao's concern.
    One day, Chairman Mao got off the car and walked along the Yangtze River Bridge from Hankou. Along the way, he saw many laborers carrying, lifting, and holding things, and Chairman Mao talked and shook hands with them. A working woman was carrying a baby in her arms on the bridge. Chairman Mao stroked the baby's head and looked at it with a smile. The woman couldn't remember for a moment, who is this? Why is he so familiar! Suddenly someone said: "This is Chairman Mao!" The woman suddenly woke up and shouted excitedly: "My child is so lucky! He saw Chairman Mao!" A large group of people said one after another: "Ah! Chairman Mao! I saw him, I'm so lucky!"
    When visiting the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, as soon as Chairman Mao got off the car in front of the factory building, he was surrounded by workers from all directions. The wide square and factory building in front of the factory were densely packed with people. Wherever Chairman Mao went, there was a storm of applause and cheers. Chairman Mao shook hands and greeted the workers standing on both sides, but as a result, there were more and more people, and even the road was blocked. Later, many cadres cleared the way in front, and it was not easy to enter the factory building. The weather was particularly hot that day, and we also ran to the iron-smelting and coke-oven areas, plus the crowds everywhere, and everyone was covered in sweat. It was not easy to get to the car. I breathed a sigh of relief and said to Wang Renzhong, the First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, who accompanied us: "We have finally broken through the siege!"
    When visiting the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory, as soon as Chairman Mao's car entered the factory gate, workers gathered from all directions, and the more we went forward, the more people there were. Every time we went to a workshop, some workers even couldn't help leaving their posts to follow us, rushing to see it first and then wanting to see it again. The sound of applause and cheers of "Long live!" really deafened our ears. Secretary Wang shouted loudly to the workers: "Go to work! Go to production! Don't follow us!" Who would listen to him? Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, said to me: "The workers are simply going crazy!" I said: "That's no wonder. Today is their happiest moment. Their actions are completely out of sincerity and an irrepressible expression of enthusiasm."
    When visiting the Daye Steel Plant, there were many workers, and the plant was under expansion, so there were also many construction workers. Their cheers, applause, and cries of "Long live!" even drowned out the huge roar of the machines. The person explaining was unable to make an introduction. Originally, Secretary Wang accompanied Chairman Mao in the front, and Secretary Zhang accompanied me in the back, following closely, but as a result, we were all scattered. I and Wang and Zhang were squeezed far behind. I heard a worker ask another worker: "Did you see Chairman Mao?" The worker replied excitedly: "I saw him, and I want to see him again." After speaking, he squeezed forward again. The order was not maintained well today. Secretary Wang said: "They should ask their Party, Youth League, and trade union to have a good meeting to examine themselves!" I said: "That's no wonder. The workers' fanatical emotions are unstoppable, and the factory did not expect such a situation beforehand." Secretary Wang said: "Enthusiasm is of course good, but there must be order." We spent a lot of effort to break through the siege, and everyone was covered in sweat and wet. Chairman Mao still looked and listened calmly, with a smile on his face, and kept waving to the workers.
    Chairman Mao visited Anqing No. 1 Middle School. As soon as he got off the car at the school gate, someone in a house across the street saw him and exclaimed in surprise: "It's Chairman Mao!" Immediately, the masses gathered around and rushed towards the school, forcing the school to quickly close the gate. The students saw Chairman Mao, cheered "Long live!", clapped and jumped. Their love for their leader was so innocent and pure! I said to Huang Yan, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee and Governor: "The students are simply crazy. They have grown up so much, and I'm afraid they have never been so happy as they are today!" "Today, Chairman Mao came to their school, and they were able to admire Chairman Mao's appearance. This is such a happy moment!" Governor Huang said: "Chairman Mao's visit to the school has a very great encouraging effect, not only encouraging this school, but also encouraging schools in Anqing and the whole province."
    More and more people gathered outside the school, and the street was narrow. When the Chairman came out of the school, the crowd boiled over. It was not easy to clear a way out and get into the car. Not far from the car, we arrived at the small blast furnace run by the cadres of the Anqing organs. These cadres were working hard, and their hands were dirty. Chairman Mao shook hands with them, and they couldn't care about their dirty hands. They rushed to shake hands with Chairman Mao. Secretaries Zeng and Huang both said: "Don't shake hands!" But no one would listen. This is such a rare opportunity! They will never forget seeing Chairman Mao and shaking hands with him.
    This time, however, we were heavily surrounded by the masses. I don't know how, probably when we went into the factory to see the small blast furnace, the news spread, and the street outside the factory was already crowded with people. As soon as Chairman Mao came out, he was densely surrounded by the masses. It took a lot of effort to get into the car, but the front and back of the car were crowded with people, and the car couldn't move. The comrades maintaining order tried to push the masses to both sides, but they couldn't push them away. As soon as they pushed them away, the car could only move a few steps, and the masses rushed up again, insisting on seeing Chairman Mao. The car horn screamed hard, but people turned a deaf ear. The scene of the masses' love for their leader is difficult to describe in words. Governor Huang, who was in the same car with me, was very anxious. He said: "Do you think the Chairman will blame us? We didn't notify the masses, they came by themselves, and we can't help it." I said: "It's okay, the Chairman won't blame us." We were surrounded for a long time, and it was not easy to drive the car out segment by segment and proceed to the highway to Hefei.
    On the day Chairman Mao left Hefei, the leaders of Anhui Province, in view of the experience of the excessive enthusiasm of the masses during previous visits, which affected order, and in order to allow more people to admire Chairman Mao's grace and satisfy their wishes, greeted the masses in advance to stand on both sides of the road, and asked Chairman Mao to stand in an open-top jeep and proceed. Chairman Mao had never been to Anhui, and the people of Anhui were so eager to see their beloved leader!
    According to Zhang Kaifan, Deputy Governor of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, the original plan was to notify 150,000 people, but many gathered automatically, and even many farmers in the suburbs came upon hearing the news. It is estimated that there were 200,000 to 300,000 people, equal to half of the population of Hefei. From our residence all the way to the railway station, for more than ten miles, the sides were densely packed with workers, farmers, citizens, teachers, students, organ cadres, the People's Liberation Army, and Young Pioneers. In order to see their beloved Chairman Mao, they forgot the raindrops fluttering on their heads and the muddy road under their feet, and waited with joyful, excited, and happy expectations.
    Chairman Mao, accompanied by Secretary Zeng Xisheng, stood on the first open-top jeep, and Minister Luo Ruiqing of the Central Public Security Department, Governor Huang, and Deputy Governor Zhang and I stood on the second open-top jeep. The vehicles moved slowly forward, and wherever they passed, a wave of people immediately surged. "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party!" The cheers and applause, like waves, vibrated and roared on the ten-mile-long road. People jumped and danced, waving their arms, extremely enthusiastic and orderly. As soon as the car entered the railway station, the nearby masses, not content with having seen Chairman Mao, followed and poured into the platform, crowding around the carriages and shouting "Long live!" Chairman Mao came out of the carriage several times to wave to the masses. The train slowly pulled out of the station, and the masses still stood there reluctantly, unwilling to disperse.
    The Anhui Daily published a detailed account of the situation on that day, September 29th. I quote a few paragraphs as follows:
      "Chairman Mao, who is over sixty years old, stood in the car for more than thirty minutes as the car drove through the city, waving frequently to the people with a radiant look. People cheered to their hearts' content while greedily looking at the Chairman's kind face. Young girls shook the bouquets in their hands, jumping hand in hand, college students danced and threw their hats; grandmothers with their grandsons held their grandsons high, pointing to Chairman Mao's tall figure. More than 10,000 Young Pioneers in Hefei waved thousands of red scarves, like rolling fire dragons. How many people shed tears of excitement! A car driver stood on the car, clapping and shouting repeatedly: 'Happiness! Happiness! 120,000 points of happiness!'"
      "...Hu Enfa, deputy director of the Jianghuai People's Commune, is over fifty years old. He was sick at home. When he heard the noise in the yard, he asked and learned that he was going to see Chairman Mao, so he resolutely rejected the dissuasion of others and rushed to Hefei in the rain. After seeing Chairman Mao, he was so moved that he shed tears. He said to others: 'This is more happy and comfortable than when I came back from Shanghai twenty years ago and saw my long-separated old mother!'"
      "The citizens of Hefei, from grandmothers in their sixties and seventies to little babies in kindergartens, felt infinite warmth for seeing Chairman Mao. Li Daoying, director of the Miaohou Street Residents' Committee, said to others: 'After seeing Chairman Mao, I even woke up smiling in my dreams.'... The little babies in the Miaohou Street Kindergarten, after seeing Chairman Mao, jumped happily in the street and shouted: 'I saw Chairman Mao!'
  'Chairman Mao even pointed at us with his finger and smiled!'"
    After the train pulled out of the platform, Minister Luo Ruiqing, who was traveling with me, said: "Today's practice of 'cheering along the way' is the first exception to Chairman's many inspection tours." Originally, no matter where Chairman Mao went, he always traveled lightly and simply, not only not wanting the masses to pick him up, but also not even letting the local Party and government leaders pick him up. But this time, 200,000 people in Hefei had the opportunity to see their beloved leader (Chairman Mao met a total of more than 400,000 people in various places in Anhui), and I was particularly happy. I said to Chairman Mao: "Today, the masses' emotions are so fanatical, and their adoration and love for the leader is really moving." Chairman Mao said modestly: "This is because they feel that they are already in charge of their own affairs, and they are the masters of the country." I said: "That's right, but without the correct and wise leadership of the Party and the Chairman, the country could not have become so strong so quickly, and the people's lives could not have improved so quickly. They would not have today's enthusiastic and happy performance." "In the past, people were frowning, but today everyone is smiling. This is the biggest change." Chairman Mao said with a smile: "Yes, they have all seen the bright future of our socialism and seen their own beautiful prospects."
    This fully shows how the most beloved leader of the people of the whole country loves the masses of the people and how he wholeheartedly creates happiness for the people. (Attached photo)

    人民热爱毛主席
    ——随毛主席视察散记
  　张治中
    这次我荣幸地随从毛主席视察各地，经湖北（武汉、鄂城、大冶、黄石）、安徽（安庆、舒城、合肥、芜湖、马鞍山）、南京、上海、杭州等地，自9月10日至29日历时十九天，沿途见闻实多，没有预备发表，只想就各地人民群众真挚、狂热地爱戴毛主席的情景描写一二。这是广大人民群众所喜闻乐道的。特别是台湾方面经常在捏造什么“大陆人民不断掀起反共抗暴运动”这一类谎言，看了我这篇报道自然不攻自破了。
    现在全国人民都坚决信仰、拥护共产党、毛主席，愿意永远跟着共产党、毛主席走。而各地人民群众对毛主席这种真挚、狂热的爱戴是中外古今所罕有的。这就完全证明了共产党、毛主席早在广大人民群众中树立了无比崇高的信仰，获得了史无前例的拥护。“毛主席，像太阳，照到那里那里亮”，这话真一点不错。他到那里，那里就轰动，就沸腾，就狂欢。谁要想形容人民群众对毛主席的爱戴情形，谁就一定会觉得自己的嘴巴和笔杆简直太笨了。即使使用电影摄影机和录音机，我想也只能表现一些表面的情况，而人民群众内心的真挚爱戴自己亲爱的领袖的感情，怎能描写其万一？我这里只能略叙一些片断的印象。
    先从毛主席视察武汉大学说起吧。进学校时已经天黑了，参观完化学系和物理系办的几个小型工厂后我们就到了校本部面前的广场。那里，黑压压地站满了人群。武大、水利学院、测量学院、民族分院四院校的全体师生一万三千多人都集中了。毛主席刚在台上出现，下面就立刻掀起了一片欢呼声、鼓掌声，他们尽情地跳呀叫呀：“万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”不断从人群中传出来，真是声如雷动！他们一定在想：这是多么光荣、多么幸福的时刻呀！能够看到自己敬爱的领袖。
    毛主席从台阶往主席台走，边走边举手和大家招呼，然后和大家一起鼓掌，然后从台的这边踱向那边，又从那边踱向这边。在强烈的汽灯下，大家把毛主席看得清清楚楚，万多双眼睛跟着毛主席在转动，万多颗心在激动地跳跃，多少人兴奋得掉下热泪呀！毛主席就在他们的鼓掌欢呼声中离开了。
    事后据说，当晚他们学校竟轰动了，多少人兴奋得睡不着觉，多少人在彻夜交谈着今晚不平凡的会见。特别是和毛主席握过手谈过话的人，不厌重复地一遍又一遍把经过告诉别人，写信告诉自己的亲人，多少人跑进实验室和工厂，开会讨论，修改跃进计划，他们都决心加倍的努力来报答毛主席的关怀。
    有一天，毛主席由汉口经过长江大桥时下车步行，一路看到挑的、抬的、提的许多劳动者，毛主席都和他们问话握手。一位劳动妇女手上抱了一个婴儿在桥上走，毛主席抚摩着婴儿的头满脸笑容注视着。这位妇女一下想不起来，这是谁呢？怎这样面熟！忽有人说：“这是毛主席！”这位妇女猛地醒悟过来，激动地欢叫：“我这孩子有福气呀！看到了毛主席了！”一大群人都纷纷说：“啊！毛主席！我看到了，真幸运！”
    参观武钢时，毛主席在厂房前刚下车，就被四面八方的工人群众簇拥着，那样宽大的厂前广场和厂房，黑压压地挤满了人。毛主席走到那里，那里就响起了暴风雨般掌声和欢呼声。毛主席和站在两旁的工人握手问好，结果群众越来越多，连路都被堵塞了，后来许多干部在前面开路，好容易才进了厂房。那一天天气特别热，又跑到炼铁炼焦的地方，加上到处人群拥挤，大家弄得混身大汗，好容易才走到汽车旁边，我吐了一口气，和陪同参观的中共湖北省委第一书记王任重说：“我们算是突出重围了！”
    参观武汉重型机床厂时，毛主席坐车刚进工厂大门，工人们就四面八方集拢来，越往前走群众越多。每到一个车间，甚至有些工人情不自禁地离开了岗位跟着走，争先恐后地看到了还要再看。鼓掌声，欢呼万岁声，真连耳朵都给震聋了。王书记对工人们大声喊：“你们工作去吧！生产去吧！不要跟着了！”谁听他呢。中共湖北省委书记张平化和我说：“工人同志们简直发狂了！”我说：“这也难怪，今天正是他们最幸福的时刻。他们这种举动是完全出自真诚、难以遏制的热情表现。”
    在参观大冶钢厂时，工人多，该厂正在扩建中，基建工人也多。他们的欢呼声、鼓掌声、万岁声连机器的巨大轰隆声都被淹没了，解说的人无法作介绍。本来王书记陪毛主席在前，张书记陪我在后，紧紧跟着的，结果都被冲散了。我和王、张远远被挤到后面来了。我听到一个工人问另一个工人：“你看到毛主席没有？”那个工人兴奋地答：“看到了，我还想再看一次。”说完就又往前挤。今天秩序是维持得不够好，王书记说：“应该要他们党、团、工会好好地开会检讨一下！”我说：“这也难怪，工人们的狂热情绪是没法阻挡的，厂方事先也没有料到会有这样情况。”王书记说：“热情当然是好的，但总要有秩序。”我们费了很大的力气才冲出了重围，大家都是满头大汗混身湿透。毛主席还是那样从容地看着听着，满脸笑容，不停地向工人群众举手致意。
    毛主席参观安庆第一中学，刚在校门下车，就被学校对门的一家看见了，有人惊喜地叫：“是毛主席！”立刻群众就围拢过来，拥向学校，逼得学校赶快关上大门。学生们看到了毛主席，欢呼万岁，鼓掌跳跃，他们对领袖的热爱是多么天真纯洁呀！我和中共安徽省委书记兼省长黄岩说：“学生们简直狂了，他们长了那么大，恐怕从来没有像今天这样高兴过！”“今天毛主席到他们学校来，他们能够瞻仰到毛主席的颜色，这是多么幸福的时刻呀！”黄省长说：“毛主席到学校一趟，鼓舞的作用非常大，不仅鼓舞了这个学校，而且安庆和全省的学校都受到鼓舞。”
    校外群众越聚越多，街道又窄，主席从学校出来群众就沸腾起来了，好容易才排开一条出路上了车。车行不远，到了安庆机关干部办的小高炉。这些机关干部正在紧张地劳动，手上稀脏的，毛主席和他们握手，他们也顾不了自己手脏，争先恐后地来和毛主席握手。曾、黄两书记都说：“不要握手了吧！”但大家那里会听，这是多难得的机会呀！看到了毛主席还握了手，在他们将是永生难忘的。
    这回却被群众重重包围了。也不知是怎样的，大概我们进厂看小高炉时群众就传开了，厂外街上早已挤满了人群，毛主席一出来就被群众密密层层地包围着。费了好大力气才上了车，但是车前车后都拥挤了人群，车子没法开走。维持秩序的同志想把群众往两旁推开也推不走，刚推开一下，车子也只能走上几步，群众又拥上来一定要看到毛主席。汽车喇叭用劲嘶叫，人们充耳不闻。群众这种对领袖的热爱情景是很难用笔墨形容的。和我同车的黄省长发急得很，他说：“你看主席会不会怪我们？我们并没有通知群众，他们自己涌来的，我们也没有办法。”我说：“没有什么，主席不会见怪的。”我们被包围了好久，好容易才一段一段地把车子开出去，往合肥的公路进发。
    在毛主席离开合肥的一天，安徽省领导同志有鉴于过去参观时群众过分热情因而影响秩序的经验，并且为了使更多的群众能够瞻仰到毛主席的丰彩，满足他们的愿望，事前就招呼群众站在马路两旁，请毛主席站在敞篷的吉普车上行进。毛主席从未到过安徽，安徽人民群众是多么渴望看到自己敬爱的领袖啊！
    据中共安徽省委书记张恺帆副省长告诉我，原定通知群众十五万人，但是自动集合的很多，连郊区农民都很多闻风而至，估计群众在二十至三十万，等于合肥市人口的半数。从我们住处一直排到火车站，长达十多里，两旁站得密密层层的，有工人、有农民、有市民、有教师、有学生、有机关干部、有解放军、有红领巾，他们为了要看到自己敬爱的毛主席，竟忘记了头上飘拂着的雨点，忘记了脚下泥泞的道路，带着欢欣鼓舞幸福期待的心情等待着。
    毛主席由曾希圣书记陪同站在第一部敞篷的吉普车上，我和中央公安部罗瑞卿部长、黄省长、张副省长站在第二部敞篷的吉普车上。车辆缓缓前进，所过之处，立刻掀起了人海的浪潮。“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”欢呼声、鼓掌声，就如同波涛一样，在十多里长的马路上震荡着，呼啸着。人们蹦着跳着，挥舞着手臂，极其热烈而有秩序。汽车刚进火车站，附近的群众看到了毛主席还不算，还跟着蜂涌进入月台，拥到车厢旁边，欢呼万岁。毛主席几次从车厢中走出来向群众招手致意。火车已经慢慢地开出车站，群众还恋恋不舍地站在那里，不肯散去。
    当天的情形9月29日安徽日报登载得详细，我引用几小段如下：
      “六十多岁高龄的毛主席，在汽车驶过市区的三十多分钟里，一直站在汽车上，神采奕奕地对人们频频挥手。人们一面尽情欢呼，一面贪婪地端详着主席慈祥的面庞。年轻的姑娘摇动着手里的花束，手拉手跳跃着，大学生们手舞足蹈，抛起了他们的帽子；带着孙子的老祖母，把她们的孙子举得高高的，指点着毛主席高大的身影。合肥市一万多少先队员，挥舞着千万条红领巾，宛如滚滚翻动的火龙。多少人兴奋得流下眼泪！一个汽车司机登在汽车上一面鼓掌，一面连声高叫：‘幸福！幸福！十二万分幸福！’”
      “……江淮人民公社副主任胡恩发，五十多岁了。他正生病在家，听到院子里闹闹嚷嚷的，一打听说是要见毛主席去，就坚决拒绝了别人的劝阻，冒雨赶到合肥。看到了毛主席之后感动得流下泪来，他对人说：‘这比我二十年前从上海做工回来看到久别的老娘幸福舒坦多了！’……”
      “合肥市的市民们，从六、七十岁的老奶奶到幼儿园里的小宝宝，都为见了毛主席而感到无限温暖。庙后街居民委员会主任李道英对人说：‘见了毛主席，我连做梦都笑醒了。’……庙后街幼儿园的小宝宝们看见了毛主席后，满街跳跃快乐地嚷道：‘我见到毛主席啦！’
  ‘毛主席还笑着用手指着我们呢！’”
    火车开出站台后，同行的罗瑞卿部长和我说：“今天这种‘夹道欢送’的做法，是主席多次出来视察的第一次破例。”原来毛主席不管到那里去，都是轻车简从，不但不要群众接送，就是连地方党政领导同志也是不让接送的，而这次合肥二十多万人民竟有机会见到自己敬爱的领袖（毛主席这次在安徽各地会见的群众共有四十多万），我实在感到特别高兴。我和毛主席说：“今天群众情绪这样狂热，他们对领袖拥戴敬爱的情景实在使人感动。”毛主席谦逊地说：“这是他们感到自己已经当家作主了，他们是国家的主人了。”我说：“这话对，不过要是没有党和主席正确英明的领导，国家不能这样快强大，人民生活不能这样快改善，他们也不会有今天这样热烈欢乐的表现。”“过去人们都是愁眉苦脸，而今天人人喜笑颜开，这就是最大的转变。”毛主席含笑说：“是的，他们都已经看到我们社会主义的光明前途，看到自己的美好远景了。”
    这充分说明全国人民最敬爱的领袖，怎样热爱人民群众，怎样全心全意为人民创造幸福。（附图片）
