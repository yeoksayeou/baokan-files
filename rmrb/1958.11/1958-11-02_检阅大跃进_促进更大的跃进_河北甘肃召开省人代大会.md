Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 31st. The first session of the Second Hebei Provincial People's Congress was held from October 25th to 28th. The representatives listened to and discussed the work report made by Liu Zihou, Governor of Hebei Province, on behalf of the Provincial People's Committee. The report pointed out that the socialist construction of Hebei Province has seen a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958. In particular, the high tide of agricultural production centered on water conservancy construction has promoted the development of various production undertakings. In the past year, the province has expanded its irrigated area by more than 65 million mu, equivalent to 2.45 times the total irrigated area in the province for thousands of years before the Great Leap Forward. The achievements in water conservancy construction overcame the severe drought in the first half of this year, achieved a bumper summer harvest, and produced many large-scale high-yield fields and high-yield "satellite" fields. This year, the total grain output of the province is expected to reach 45 billion jin, an average of more than 1,000 jin per person, and the problem of grain self-sufficiency has been basically solved. In the past two months, the people of the province have launched a rush to plant wheat centered on deep plowing, and are striving to achieve a wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu next year. The mass movement to run industry has made great achievements. The small industrial enterprises belonging to the people's communes have developed to more than one million. In particular, small-scale indigenous steelmaking furnaces have been developed in large numbers. At present, the autumn harvest and wheat planting have basically ended, and more rural labor will continue to be invested in steel production. In the movements of mass steel production, autumn harvest, plowing, and wheat planting, the people's communes have demonstrated great superiority.

After heated discussions, the meeting made a resolution stipulating that the current general task of Hebei Province is: to continue to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, to vigorously promote the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, to vigorously promote communist education, and on the basis of consolidating the rural people's communes and developing the urban people's communes, to further mobilize the people of the province to launch a greater upsurge in production and construction, to resolutely ensure the completion of this year's production and construction plan centered on steel, and to make full preparations for a greater leap forward next year.

The meeting elected Liu Zihou as Governor; Yan Dakai, Yang Yingjie, Li Gengtao, Gao Shuxun, Ruan Bosheng, Hu Kaiming, Zhang Minghe, Yang Yizhou, Ma Li, and Zhang Kerang as Deputy Governors; Ding Tingxin and 42 others as members of the Provincial People's Committee; and Wu Qingcheng as President of the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court. The meeting also elected the representatives of Hebei Province to the Second National People's Congress: Wan Xiaotang, Yu Xuezhong, Wang Heshou, Wang Guoquan, Wang Wei, Wang Kun (female), Wang Zehua, Wang Guofan, Wang Yunsheng, Wang Dezhi, Wang Ligeng, Wang Guangying, Qiu Guanghe, Tian Xiujuan (female), Shi Zhiren, Liu Lantao, Liu Zihou, Liu Xiufeng, Liu Baiyu, Liu Xianzhou, Liu Baozhong, Liu Changfu, Liu Qingyang (female), Liu Chijun, Qi Yanming, Rong Guanxiu (female), Sun Guizhen (female), Zhu Jisheng, Zhu Xianyi, Zhu Mengsu, Li Jiebo, Li Peizhi (female), Li Zhizhong, Li Gengtao, Li Fenglan (female), Li Yong, Li Zhaozhen (female), Li Guojun, Li Dequan (female), Li Zhuchen, Gu Xiaobo, Wu Wentao, Wu Yunshan, Chen Hansheng, Xiao Changhua, Luo Yuchuan, Jin Zhifu, Lin Tie, Meng Mudi, Zhou Shutao, Xi Zhanyuan, Zan Ling, Hou Baozheng, Yu Aifeng (female), Rong Gaotang, Gao Shuxun, Xu Xin (female), Ma Wanshui, Ma John, Ma Yanxiang, Ma Sicong, Ma Zhuozhou, Geng Changsuo, Tao Menghe, Kang Xiumin, Zhang JinYi, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Su, Zhang Qingchun, Zhang Guozhong, Zhang Xiangtong, Zhang Guofan, Zhang Yan, Yang Xiufeng, Yang Yumin, Yang Liying (female), Yang Fuqing, Yang Shixian, Lu Yuwen, Qian Jiaguang, Bo Yibo, Tan Zhen.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 31st. The first session of the Second Gansu Provincial People's Congress was held in Lanzhou from October 25th to 29th.

During the meeting, the representatives had a heated discussion on the work report of the Provincial People's Committee made by Ma Qingnian, Vice Governor of Gansu Province, to the Congress. The representatives believed that Gansu, like all parts of the country, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, is developing its socialist construction undertakings with the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping and the speed of a thousand miles a day. From January to September this year, the total industrial output value of the province increased by 88% compared with the same period last year, of which local industry increased by 129%; Gansu had never produced even one jin of steel in its history, but this year it will produce 100,000 tons of steel and 300,000 tons of iron. By the end of September, the province had newly built 17.99 million mu of watered land, controlling soil erosion in an area of more than 51,000 square kilometers; the total grain output reached 20 billion jin, more than double that of last year, with an average grain yield of 405 jin per mu and an average of 1,540 jin of grain per person, which is unprecedented in Gansu Province. What is even more worth mentioning is that the people of the province have also begun the project of diverting the Tao River up the mountain and the Liujiaxia Hydropower Hub project with revolutionary heroism. In just one and a half months, the province's rural areas realized the people's commune system, especially the pastoral areas of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which also crossed the stage of social development and realized the people's commune system. Next year is the decisive year for "three years of hard work to change the face of Gansu." The meeting passed a resolution calling on the people and cadres of the province to further boost their efforts, under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, along the direction indicated by the general line of socialist construction, to carry out the communist education movement, run the people's communes well, continue to work hard, and strive to complete and over fulfill the various tasks for 1959, in order to greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland with a greater leap forward and greater victories.

The meeting elected Deng Baoshan as Governor of Gansu Province, Ma Hongbin (Hui), Huo Weide, Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), Ma Qingnian (Hui), Zhang Pengtu, Huang Luobin, Li Peifu, and Ge Shiying as Deputy Governors, and Wang Bingxiang and 28 others as members of the Gansu Provincial People's Committee by secret ballot. Wu Sihong was elected President of the Gansu Provincial Higher People's Court. The meeting also elected Deng Baoshan, Ren Qian, Wang Dechang, Li Hanyuan, Chen Peihua (female), Ma Yong (Dongxiang), Ma Qingnian (Hui), Ma Hongbin (Hui), Gao Jianjun, Guo Menghe, Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), Zhang Zhizhong, Yang Mingxuan, Yang Fuxing (Tibetan), Yang Jingren (Hui), Yang Chengzhong, Jiang Cisheng, Huo Weide, Wei Yuying (female) and other nineteen people as representatives to the Second National People's Congress.

    检阅大跃进　促进更大的跃进
    河北甘肃召开省人代大会
    新华社天津31日电　河北省从10月25日到28日召开了第二届人民代表大会第一次会议。代表们听取和讨论了河北省省长刘子厚代表省人民委员会所作的工作报告。这个报告指出，河北省社会主义建设事业在1958年出现了全面大跃进的局面。特别是以水利建设为中心的农业生产高潮，推动了各项生产事业的发展。一年来全省共扩大灌溉面积六千五百多万亩，相当于大跃进前本省几千年来灌溉面积总和的二点四五倍。兴修水利的成就，克服了今年上半年的严重干旱，获得了夏季丰收，并且出现了许多大面积丰产田和高产“卫星”田。今年全省粮食总产量可达四百五十亿斤，平均每人一千斤以上，粮食自给问题已经基本解决。近两月来，全省人民展开了以深翻地为中心的种麦突击运动，正在力争明年实现小麦亩产千斤省。全民大办工业的运动已取得很大成绩。人民公社所属的小型工业企业，已经发展到一百多万个。特别是小型土法炼钢炉已大量发展起来，目前秋收、种麦基本结束，更多的农村劳力将继续投入钢铁生产方面来。在大办钢铁工业、秋收、翻地、种麦等运动中，人民公社显示了巨大的优越性。
    经过热烈讨论，会议作出决议，规定当前河北省总的任务是：继续贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，大搞技术革命和文化革命，大搞共产主义教育，在巩固农村人民公社和发展城市人民公社的基础上，进一步发动全省人民掀起一个生产建设的更大高潮，坚决保证完成今年以钢铁为中心的生产建设计划，并为明年更大跃进作好充分准备工作。
    大会选举刘子厚为省长；阎达开、杨英杰，李耕涛、高树勋、阮泊生、胡开明、张明河、杨亦周、马力、张克让为副省长；丁廷馨等四十二人为省人民委员会委员；吴庆诚为河北省高级人民法院院长。大会并选举了河北省出席第二届全国人民代表大会代表：万晓塘、于学忠、王鹤寿、王国权、王伟、王昆（女）、王泽华、王国藩、王芸生、王德滋、王历耕、王光英、丘光河、田秀涓（女）、石志仁、刘澜涛、刘子厚、刘秀峰、刘白羽、刘仙洲、刘宝忠、刘长福、刘清扬（女）、刘持钧、齐燕铭、戎冠秀（女）、孙桂珍（女）、朱继圣、朱宪彝、朱梦苏、李颉伯、李培之（女）、李质忠、李耕涛、李凤兰（女）、李永、李兆珍（女）、李国钧、李德全（女）李烛尘、谷小波、吴文焘、吴韫山、陈翰笙、萧长华、罗玉川、金直夫、林铁、孟目的、周叔弢、郗占元、昝凌、侯宝政、俞霭峰（女）、荣高棠、高树勋、徐欣（女）、马万水、马约翰、马彦祥、马思聪、马卓洲、耿长锁、陶孟和、康修民、章靳以、张砺生、张苏、张庆春、张国忠、张香桐、张国藩、张岩、杨秀峰、杨雨民、杨璃瑛（女）、杨扶青、杨石先、卢郁文、钱嘉光、薄一波、谭真。
    新华社兰州31日电　甘肃省第二届人民代表大会第一次会议10月25日至29日在兰州举行。
    会议期间，代表们就甘肃省副省长马青年向大会作的省人民委员会工作报告进行了热烈的讨论。代表们认为，甘肃和全国各地一样，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，社会主义建设事业正以万马奔腾的气势和一日千里的速度向前发展。从今年1月到9月，全省工业总产值比去年同期增长了88％，其中地方工业增长了129％；甘肃历史上没有生产过一斤钢，而今年将产钢十万吨，铁三十万吨。到9月底，全省已经新修水地一千七百九十九万亩，控制水土流失面积五万一千多平方公里；粮食总产量达到二百亿斤，比去年增加一倍还多，平均亩产粮食四百零五斤，平均每人粮食一千五百四十斤，这是甘肃省空前未有的事情。更值得提出的是，全省人民还以革命的英雄气概，开始了引洮上山工程和刘家峡水电枢纽工程。在短短一个半月的时间里，全省农村实现了人民公社化，特别是甘南藏族自治州的牧区，也跨过社会发展阶段，实现了人民公社化。明年是“苦战三年，改变甘肃面貌”的决战年，会议通过决议，号召全省人民和全体干部，进一步鼓足干劲，在中共中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在中共甘肃省委的直接领导下，沿着社会主义建设总路线所指示的方向，开展共产主义教育运动，办好人民公社，继续苦战，力争完成和超额完成1959年的各项任务，以更大的跃进和更大的胜利来迎接我们伟大祖国建国十周年。
    会议以无记名投票方式，选举邓宝珊为甘肃省省长，马鸿宾（回）、霍维德、黄正清（藏）、马青年（回）、张鹏图、黄罗斌、李培福、葛士英为副省长，王秉祥等二十八人为甘肃省人民委员会委员。选举吴思宏为甘肃省高级人民法院院长。会议还选出邓宝珊、任谦、汪德昌、李翰园、陈佩华（女）、马泳（东乡）、马青年（回）、马鸿宾（回）、高健君、郭孟和、黄正清（藏）、张治中、杨明轩、杨复兴（藏）、杨静仁（回）、杨澄中、蒋次升、霍维德、魏毓英（女）等十九人为出席第二届全国人民代表大会的代表。
