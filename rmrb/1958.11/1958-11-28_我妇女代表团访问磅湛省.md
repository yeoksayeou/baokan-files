Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 27th — The Chinese Women's Delegation visited the prosperous Kampong Cham Province in Cambodia on the 26th.

　　The delegation visited the rubber plantations in Kampong Cham Province and the poultry and cattle demonstration center built with Chinese assistance. The agricultural, timber, and fishing industries' development in this province attracted the attention of the Chinese guests.

　　The delegation also visited a tobacco production cooperative and two schools, one of which was the Sihanouk High School founded by Prime Minister Sihanouk in 1941. During the visit, members of the delegation had cordial conversations with Cambodian female teachers.

　　The Governor of Kampong Cham Province, Ouk Aim An, specially arranged a picnic near the horse farm built with Chinese assistance to entertain the Chinese guests. A special kind of bamboo grows here, with branches and leaves intertwined to form a natural awning that can be used to shield against the tropical sun. Under the awning made of this bamboo, on the clear lakeside, female students from Sihanouk High School performed captivating Cambodian dances, among which a dance praising the friendship between China and Khmer was especially welcomed by the Chinese guests.

　　After listening to Governor Ouk Aim An's introduction to the economic development of Kampong Cham Province, the delegation praised the Cambodian government's concern for the people's lives and expressed its belief that in a few years, the Cambodian people will use their own strength to build Cambodia into a wealthy and prosperous country.

    我妇女代表团访问磅湛省
    新华社金边27日电　中国妇女代表团在26日访问了柬埔寨富饶的磅湛省。
    代表团参观了磅湛省的橡胶园和中国援助建设的家禽和养牛示范中心。这个省的农业、木材业和渔业的发展情况引起中国客人们的注意。
    代表团还参观了一个烟草生产合作社和两所学校，其中一所是西哈努克首相在1941年创办的西哈努克中学。在参观时，代表团成员同柬埔寨女教师进行了亲切的交谈。
    磅湛省省长奥金安在中国帮助建设的马场附近特地安排了一次野餐，招待中国客人。这里生长着一种特别的竹子，竹枝和竹叶交织在一起，形成一种天然的篷幕，可以用来遮挡热带的阳光。在这种竹子搭成的篷幕下面，在明澈的湖畔，西哈努克中学的女学生跳起动人的柬埔寨舞蹈，其中有一个歌颂中国—高棉友谊的舞蹈特别受到中国客人们的欢迎。
    代表团在听了奥金安省长介绍了磅湛省经济发展的情况以后，赞扬柬埔寨政府对于人民生活的关怀，并且表示相信，在几年以后，柬埔寨人民将会用自己的力量把柬埔寨建成富有和繁荣的国家。
