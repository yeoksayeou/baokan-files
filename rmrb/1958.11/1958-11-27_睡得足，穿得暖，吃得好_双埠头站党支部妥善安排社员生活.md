Enough Sleep, Warm Clothes, Good Food
    Shuangbutou Station Party Branch Properly Arranges Commune Members' Lives

    (Our Dispatch) The Shuangbutou Station Party Branch of the Songzhuang People's Commune in Tongzhou District, Beijing, while vigorously engaging in production, is actively taking various concrete measures to ensure that commune members spend the winter warmly and comfortably.
    The Party branch has held several special meetings to study and resolve the winter living problems of commune members. In early September, during the rush to seize the autumn deep plowing, the weather was already cool in the mornings and evenings. The Party branch and the station chief discovered that some commune members had not yet put on their cotton-padded clothes. They promptly convened a meeting of cadres and decided to advance some money to commune members with difficult family lives who lacked cotton-padded clothing. After the meeting, each production team conducted a survey and found that 309 households needed to make new cotton-padded clothes, change linings, change fabric, or add new cotton. The commune immediately allocated 1,200 yuan according to urgency, first to those working in the fields, going to Miyun to build reservoirs, and smelting steel. The remaining portion was then addressed. The cotton-padded clothing for the 44 elderly people in the Happiness Home was all prepared by the end of September. 200 yuan in subsidies was also allocated early for the twenty-odd children from families in difficulty in the kindergarten. To enable commune members to wear new clothes in a timely manner, the station's sewing factory has already rushed to produce more than 300 pieces of cotton-padded and leather clothing for commune members from August to the present. The 400 pieces of mended and renewed cotton-padded clothing made by the clothing factory are already being worn by commune members.
    In order to ensure that commune members have eight hours of sleep each day, the Shuangbutou Station recently announced a new work schedule, arranging production tightly. They go to the fields at 7:00 a.m. every day, which is an hour and a half later than before, and the lunch break is shortened from two hours to one hour. If there are no crash tasks in the evening, work is stopped at 5:30 p.m. In this way, 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. becomes a time for cultural study, meetings, and entertainment. Now the winter indoor club has been established, and commune members can sit in a warm room playing chess, playing cards, reading books and newspapers after a day's labor.
    In order to ensure that commune members eat their fill and eat well, the Party branch secretary personally convened a meeting of canteen managers and cooks to study and improve meals. Now, the seventeen canteens of Shuangbutou Station have all been restaurantized, and each canteen has five to ten neat and bright northern-facing rooms. They are also preparing to build stoves in each dining hall for commune members to keep warm while eating. The kitchen and dining hall of the canteen are in the same courtyard, so you can serve and eat as you go, ensuring that commune members can eat hot meals every time. In order to ensure that there are vegetables to eat in winter, each canteen has stored enough cabbage, radishes, etc. in the vegetable cellar to eat for three months, and has also pickled a large amount of pickles. The cooks are also busy making sauce and soy sauce, and are also preparing to plant spinach in the canteen's vegetable garden. In order to improve meals and allow commune members to eat stewed meat and dumplings during the New Year, each canteen will raise another sixty pigs in addition to the existing forty pigs.
    The Party branch is also very concerned about the winter personal life problems of commune members. Firewood is supplied to each household for boiling water for washing in the morning and for heating the kang at night, with an average of one and a half corn stalks per kang per day. Because communization of canteens saves a lot of corn stalks, it can be guaranteed that there will be no shortage of fuel.

    睡得足，穿得暖，吃得好
    双埠头站党支部妥善安排社员生活
    本报讯　北京市通州区宋庄人民公社双埠头站的党支部在大搞生产的同时，积极采取各项具体措施，让社员暖暖和和的度过冬天。
    党支部曾经多次专门研究解决社员的冬季生活问题。在9月初突击抢秋深翻时，早晚天气已凉，党支部和站长发现有些社员还没有穿上棉衣，便及时召集了干部会，决定预支一部分钱给家庭生活困难而又缺少棉衣的社员。会后，各生产队经过调查，需做新棉衣、换里、换面、添新棉花的社员共有三百零九户，社里当即分别缓急，先预支了一千二百元给下地干活、去密云修水库和炼钢的人，其余部分接着设法解决。幸福院四十四位老人的棉衣早在9月底就已全部准备好。对幼儿园中二十几个家庭困难的孩子也早拨出了二百元补助。为了让社员能及时穿上新衣，该站的缝纫厂从8月份到现在已经为社员赶制了三百多件棉衣、皮衣。被服厂做出的四百件整旧如新的棉衣，社员已穿在身上。
    为保证社员每天有八小时的睡眠时间，双埠头站最近公布了新的作息制度，紧凑地安排了生产。每天上午七点下地，比原来推迟了一个半钟头，并且将中午吃饭休息时间由原来的两小时缩短为一小时。晚上没有突击任务，就在五点半收工。这样，晚上七点到九点，就成为文化学习、开会和娱乐的时间。现在冬季的室内俱乐部已经成立，社员劳动了一天后，晚上就可以坐在暖和的屋里下象棋、打扑克、看书报。
    为使社员吃得饱，吃得好，党支部书记亲自召集食堂管理员、炊事员的会议，研究改进伙食。现在，双埠头站的十七个食堂都已实现了餐厅化，每个食堂都有五至十间整齐明亮的北房。还准备在各饭厅内砌起炉子，为社员吃饭时取暖用。食堂的伙房与饭厅都在同一院内，可以随吃随盛，保证社员顿顿能吃热饭。为保证冬季有蔬菜吃，各食堂已经在菜窖里贮备下够三个月吃的白菜、萝卜等，还腌了大量的咸菜。炊事员们还忙着做酱和酱油，并且还准备在食堂的菜园里种上菠菜。为改善伙食，让社员在过年时能吃上炖肉、饺子，各食堂除喂好已有的四十口猪外，将再增喂六十口猪。
    党支部对社员的冬季个人生活问题也非常关心。供每家早上烧洗脸水、晚上烧炕用的柴火，平均每天每炕发给一个半玉米秸。由于食堂化节省了大量玉米秸，可以保证不会断烧。
