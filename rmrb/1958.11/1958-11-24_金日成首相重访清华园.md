    Premier Kim Il-sung Revisits Tsinghua University
    "I visited Tsinghua University in 1953, and today I am visiting again. I see that your school is advancing by leaps and bounds. In particular, you have made amazing achievements in combining education with labor. These are all the results of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people's unparalleled concern for you."
    Premier Kim Il-sung, filled with friendly passion, spoke with great enthusiasm to the more than 8,000 faculty and students gathered in the square of Tsinghua University, facing the bright sunshine of early winter. The Premier and all the distinguished guests of the Korean government delegation, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, visited Tsinghua University for more than three hours on the morning of the 23rd.
    In his speech at the welcome meeting of the entire school, the Premier also said: "Through your practice, it has been proven that the policy of combining education with labor put forward by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is correct. You have broken superstitions and created many new products and scientific research results, which are all very good things. I will convey them to the Korean university students and all students."
    "There are many Korean students in your school. After they return to their country in the future, they will make great contributions to the construction of our motherland. For this, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the students and teachers of your school, to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government."
    Premier Kim Il-sung finally warmly congratulated the growing friendship and unity between the youth and people of the two countries, and he excitedly shouted "Long live the eternal friendship between the Korean and Chinese people!"
    The music and singing of "Song of General Kim Il-sung" resounded through the square, and Premier Kim Il-sung's speech was interrupted from time to time by cheers and applause. President Jiang Nanxiang and more than 8,000 faculty and students raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the unity of the Chinese and Korean people!" "Long live Premier Kim Il-sung!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    Five years ago, not long after the Korean War ceasefire, Premier Kim Il-sung visited China with the immortal feats of the heroic Korean people in defending peace in the Far East and the world, and came to the beautiful Tsinghua Garden for the first time. Today, when the distinguished guests brought the amazing achievements of the Korean people in building socialism to China again and revisited Tsinghua Garden, they were greeted with even more enthusiastic welcomes from the faculty and students. Wherever the respected leader and glorious envoys of the Korean people went, crowds of people welcoming them lined the streets, forming torrents of unparalleled passion. Everywhere in the welcoming ranks were excited and smiling faces, everyone singing songs of friendship and chanting "Hello, Premier!" in newly learned Korean.
    Today, Premier Kim Il-sung and all the distinguished Korean guests spent more than three hours of valuable time visiting several departments such as Electrical Engineering, Power Engineering, Architecture, Mechanical Engineering, and Hydraulic Engineering, specifically to see the new achievements of teachers, students and staff in implementing the Party's education policy, and to watch the many new products and inventions they created to meet the needs of the country. Premier Kim Il-sung was always very excited after seeing so many things that he had not seen when he visited the school that year, repeatedly praising them with a smile, and encouraging the teachers and students to strive to create greater achievements.
    Premier Kim Il-sung, Premier Zhou Enlai, and others walked into a quiet courtyard in the Power Engineering Department amidst the cheers of the students lining the streets. Three small and exquisite cars were parked here. These are the microcars made by the teachers, students and staff of the Power Engineering Department.
    Premier Zhou saw this microcar when he visited Tsinghua University in August this year. Today, when he saw this familiar microcar again, he immediately said happily to Premier Kim Il-sung: "This is made by the teachers, students and staff themselves. It is cheap and easy to use. It can replace tricycles as a means of public transportation, and it can also be used by a family." Premier Zhou invited the distinguished guests to sit and see. Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Kim Il-sung, Park Jung-ae, Nam Il, Li Il-gyeong, Vice Premier Chen Yi and General Kim Kwang-hyup, smiling, boarded three microcars and drove slowly around the small courtyard for a week amidst thunderous applause. Premier Zhou and Ambassador Li Yong-ho also drove the cars themselves for a lap.
    While riding in the car, the Premier and the Premier talked and laughed. When getting out of the car, Premier Kim Il-sung repeatedly praised it.
    "What is the fuel consumption of the car?" Premier Kim Il-sung asked with great concern.
    Xu Dahong, who was driving the car next to the Premier, replied: "It uses very little fuel. One gallon of gasoline can run 100 kilometers."
    "How much does each car cost?"
    "It is currently 2,000 yuan, but it will only cost more than 1,000 yuan after mass production."
    "Can it be used to transport things?"
    The teachers and students pointed to the three seats and told the Premier: "It can be used to transport things after the seats are removed."
    Premier Zhou Enlai told Premier Kim Il-sung: "This kind of car is very easy to drive, and you can learn it quickly. We can also learn it and drive it ourselves for short distances."
    Premier Kim Il-sung said: "Indeed, you can learn it yourself and drive it yourself." The Premier then said to the teachers and students in a tone of praise: "The creation of this kind of car is really more, faster, better and more economical!"
    In a small room in the Mechanical Engineering Building, Premier Kim Il-sung and all the distinguished Korean guests watched the operation performance of the electronic computer program-controlled lathe. In the Electrical Engineering Building, after the distinguished guests watched the various self-made radio equipment made by the teachers and students, they came to a room specially displaying various televisions such as industrial televisions, movie televisions, broadcast televisions, and exploration televisions. As soon as the Premier and all the distinguished guests entered the door, their every move was displayed on the screen of a television made by the teachers and students themselves. At this time, everyone was smiling and the atmosphere in the small room was extremely joyful.
    Students lining the streets sang "Song of General Kim Il-sung" to welcome the distinguished guests to the Architecture Department. Here, Premier Kim Il-sung carefully watched the design drawings and models of many grand buildings designed by the teachers and students.
    A model of a beautiful and grand building was displayed in front of the distinguished guests. This is a design model of a large theater that can accommodate more than 5,000 people.
    The teachers and students also told the Premier with infinite gratitude that Korean student Kim Yong-cheol, who was studying at Tsinghua Garden, also participated in the design of this large theater. After hearing this, Premier Zhou Enlai immediately asked someone to invite this Korean student to meet with the Premier. Premier Kim Il-sung kindly encouraged Kim Yong-cheol to study hard and study how to accurately apply traditional national art to modern architecture.
    The vast Tsinghua Garden has been cheering in the air of friendship. During the visit, many teachers and students presented the products they made and the articles they wrote in practice to the respected Premier Kim Il-sung. Before leaving, President Jiang Nanxiang, on behalf of all the teachers, students and staff of the school, presented a photo album introducing the general situation of Tsinghua University and the Tsinghua Journal to the distinguished guests. On the first page of the photo album, there are two photos, one showing Premier Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou Enlai entering Tsinghua Garden side by side today, and the other showing the touching scene of Premier Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou Enlai smiling and riding in a microcar today. Premier Kim Il-sung was so happy when he watched these two photos recording the deep friendship, and his face showed endless smiles.

    金日成首相重访清华园
    “1953年我曾经访问过清华大学，今天再一次前来访问，我看到你们的学校正在飞跃前进。特别是在教育与劳动相结合的方面，作出了惊人的成绩。这些都是中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民对你们无比关怀的结果。”
    金日成首相满怀友谊的激情，迎着初冬的艳阳，对清华大学聚集在广场上的八千多师生发表了极其热情的讲话。首相和朝鲜政府代表团全体贵宾，23日上午由周恩来总理和陈毅副总理等人陪同，在清华大学参观了三个多小时。
    首相在全校师生欢迎大会上的讲话中还说：“通过你们的实践，已经证明中共中央提出的教育与劳动相结合的方针是正确的。你们打破迷信，创造了许多新的产品和科学研究的成果，这些都是很好的事情。我要把它们转告给朝鲜的大学生和全体学生。”
    “在你们学校里有很多朝鲜留学生，他们将来回国以后，将对我们祖国的建设事业作出很大的贡献。为此，我要对你们全校的学生和教师，对中国共产党中央和中国政府，表示衷心的感谢。”
    金日成首相最后热烈地祝贺两国青年和人民之间的友好团结日益加强，他激动地高呼“朝中人民永恒的友谊万岁！”
    广场上“金日成将军之歌”的乐曲声和歌声响彻云霄，金日成首相的讲话不时地被欢呼声和掌声打断。蒋南翔校长同八千多师生一起振臂高呼：“中朝人民团结万岁！”“金日成首相万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    五年以前，朝鲜战争停战不久，金日成首相带着英雄朝鲜人民保卫远东和世界和平的不朽功勋访问了中国，第一次来到过美丽的清华园。今天，当贵宾们带着朝鲜人民建设社会主义的惊人成就再一次来到中国，重访清华园的时候，他们受到师生们更加热情的欢迎。朝鲜人民的敬爱领袖和光荣使者们到了哪里，哪里就出现了夹道欢迎的人群，汇集成一条条洋溢着无比激情的洪流。欢迎队伍中到处是兴奋激动的笑脸，人人高唱友谊之歌，齐声用刚刚学会的朝鲜话欢呼：“首相您好！”
    今天，金日成首相和全体朝鲜贵宾，用了三个多小时的宝贵时间，去到电机、动力、建筑、机械、水利等几个系，专门去参观了师生员工们执行党的教育方针的新成就，观看了他们适应国家需要创造出来的许多新产品和创造发明。金日成首相看到那许多他当年来访问这个学校时所没有看到的东西以后，始终很兴奋，连连含笑称赞，并且勉励师生们努力创造出更大的成绩。
    金日成首相和周恩来总理等在同学们的夹道欢呼声中，走进了动力系的一座安静的院落里。这里停放着三辆小巧玲珑的小汽车。这就是动力系师生员工们自己制造的微型汽车。
    周总理在今年8月参观清华大学时就看了这种小汽车，今天他再一次看到这熟悉的小汽车以后，立刻高兴地对金日成首相说：“这是师生员工们自己制造的，价格便宜，使用方便。可以代替三轮车作为公共交通工具，也可以一家子使用。”周总理邀请贵宾们坐坐看。随后，周总理和金日成首相，朴正爱、南日、李一卿同志，陈毅副总理和金光侠大将，含笑乘上三辆微型小汽车，在春雷般的掌声中绕着小院落缓缓行驶了一周。周总理和李永镐大使还自己驾驶着小汽车跑了一圈。
    在乘小汽车的时候，首相和总理一直谈笑风生。步下小汽车的时候，金日成首相连连称好。
    “小汽车的耗油量有多大？”金日成首相极为关怀地问。
    坐在首相旁边驾驶小汽车的许大宏回答说：“用油很少，一加仑汽油可以跑一百公里。”
    “每辆汽车的价格多少？”
    “现在是两千元，将来大量生产后只要一千多元就可以了。”
    “能不能用它运东西？”
    师生们指着三个座位告诉首相：“把座位去掉以后就可以运东西。”
    周恩来总理告诉金日成首相说：“这种小汽车很好开，很快就能学会。我们也可以学，在短距离内自己开着走。”
    金日成首相说：“的确，可以自己学，自己开。”首相又以赞美的语调对师生们说：“这种小汽车的创造，真是多快好省啊！”
    在机械馆的一间小屋里，金日成首相和全体朝鲜贵宾参观了电子计算机程序控制车床的操作表演。在电机馆里，贵宾们观看了师生们自制的各种各样的无线电设备以后，来到了一间专门陈列工业电视机、电影电视机、广播电视机、勘探电视机等各种电视机的房间。首相和全体贵宾刚一进门，他们的一举一动就显现在师生们自己制造的一架电视机的银幕上，这时人人喜笑颜开，小小的房间里情绪极为欢乐。
    夹道欢迎的学生们高唱着“金日成将军之歌”把贵宾迎到建筑系。在这里，金日成首相仔细观看了师生们设计的许多宏大建筑物的设计图和模型。
    一座美丽的宏大建筑物的模型展现在贵宾面前。这是一座能容纳五千多人的大剧院的设计模型。
    师生们还怀着无限感激的心情对首相说，在清华园学习的朝鲜同学金永哲也参加了这座大剧院的设计工作。周恩来总理听到以后，马上找人请这位朝鲜同学同首相会见。金日成首相亲切地勉励金永哲好好学习，好好研究怎样确当地把传统的民族艺术运用到现代建筑上去。
    广阔的清华园一直欢腾在友谊的空气里。在参观过程中，许多师生把自己制造的产品和在实践中写出的文章献给了敬爱的金日成首相。临别时，蒋南翔校长代表全校师生员工把介绍清华大学概貌的照相册和清华学报献给了贵宾。在照相册的第一页有两张照片，一张是金日成首相和周恩来总理今天并肩进入清华园时的情景，另一张是金日成首相和周恩来总理今天含笑乘坐微型小汽车时的动人镜头。金日成首相观看这两张记录着深厚友谊的照片时，他是那样的高兴，脸上展现出无尽的笑意。
