In the busy days of procurement, in the No. 7 team of the Rocket Fifth Cooperative in Leling County, Shandong Province, more than 200 elementary school students formed the "Young Pioneers' Cotton Transport Army" to help the country transport cotton. The youngest of these students were only nine years old, and the oldest were fourteen years old. Each of them was equipped with a self-made small cart, loaded with ten, twenty, or thirty catties of cotton, depending on their carrying capacity. They set off in formation every day. Each of them wore a red scarf around their necks, and a red flag was planted on the cart. Everyone sang the following song: "Push the small cart, rush forward, transport cotton day and night, never slacking. Don't look at our young age, our enthusiasm is higher than the sky. Ants move Mount Tai, cotton piles up in the factory like a mountain. You leap forward, I leap forward, for the sake of wheat yielding two thousand catties!" They advanced in a mighty and enthusiastic manner. They transported cotton once a day on the 24-li journey. In this way, they transported more than 7,500 catties of cotton in two days, winning widespread praise. (Attached image)

    红领巾运棉营
    在大购大销运动中，山东省乐陵县火箭五社七队有二百多名小学生，组成了“红领巾运棉大军”帮助国家运送棉花。这些学生中最小的只有九岁，最大的十四岁。他们每人配备一辆自制的小土车，车上都按照能担负的分量装有十斤或二十、三十斤不等的棉花，每天整队出发。他们每人脖子上都系着红领巾，车上插着红旗，大家唱着下面的歌：“架小车，往前冲，黑夜白天送棉劲不松。别看年纪小，干劲比天高，蚂蚁搬泰山，棉花进厂堆成山。你跃进，我跃进，为的是小麦双千斤。”浩浩荡荡前进。在二十四里的路程中，每天运棉一次。就这样，他们在两天内共运送七千五百多斤棉花，博得了人们的好评。（附图片）
