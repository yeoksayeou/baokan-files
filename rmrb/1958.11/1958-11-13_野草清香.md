    Fragrant Wild Herbs
   Zeng Lin
    Hu Guizhen stared blankly at a bottle of anise oil. The dark red liquid stayed in the bottle, appearing so calm, but in Hu Guizhen's heart, it was churning with anxiety. A few days ago, the Guilin City Export Company gave the fragrance factory a task: to increase the crystallization degree (anethole purification) of anise oil. This task naturally fell on her - the "laboratory technician."
    This task was indeed not an easy one for Hu Guizhen. Hu Guizhen was originally a bamboo comb-making worker with only an elementary school education. This spring, after the Guilin City Bamboo Comb Factory was rebuilt into a fragrance factory, she became a laboratory technician. She went to the city's Industrial Bureau laboratory to study for five days. After that, Hu Guizhen learned as she worked, and she did learn some things in practice, testing out many spices. But she had never done an experiment to increase the crystallization degree of anise oil. She picked up the bottle of anise oil and shook it a few times, then poured it into a distillation flask, wanting to first measure its original crystallization degree. Hu Guizhen remembered doing an experiment to determine the crystallization degree of anise oil with chemistry students from Guangxi Normal College. The formulas the students wrote that time were all in English, and she didn't understand any of it, only remembering that a cooling method was needed to obtain the crystallization degree. Where would she get a cooler? Hu Guizhen thought and thought, then suddenly rushed out of the laboratory and ran to the street to buy a few popsicles, using the popsicles as a freezing agent. Then she lit the fire, and after a moment, the liquid began to flow up and down. Hu Guizhen drew some of it out and placed it in the popsicle-made freezer, measuring its crystallization degree to be twelve degrees. Twelve degrees was not good enough. She heard people from the factory's sales department say that the export specification was nineteen to twenty-one degrees. She thought: to increase the crystallization degree, she must first remove the water and impurities. Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius, turning into steam and escaping, and the impurities sink to the bottom, so the boiling point of the oil will be higher. If the temperature is continuously increased, more water will escape... If she keeps going like this, there will always be a temperature at which the oil distilled out will have a higher crystallization degree. So she guarded the distillation flask, starting from 100 degrees Celsius, and every time it rose by ten degrees, she drew out some oil and put it into the "freezer" to cool and measure the crystallization degree. The first time it was twelve degrees; the second time it was fourteen degrees; after nine consecutive times, Hu Guizhen discovered that the crystallization degree was best at 150 degrees and 160 degrees, reaching nineteen degrees, fragrant and rich. But she was not satisfied, and did nine more experiments, but the crystallization degree no longer increased. She was unwilling to stop there and did more than twenty experiments continuously without rest for several days. At this time, the factory director knew that she had already reached nineteen degrees, and ran to her laboratory, happily shaking her hand and saying, "You have already overfulfilled the prescribed purification degree. The export company said eighteen degrees is enough, nineteen degrees is best." But Hu Guizhen was still not satisfied with herself.
    It was this Hu Guizhen, who only had an elementary school education, who, in just over five months, successively extracted fragrances from more than seventy kinds of wild herbs, and the quality of several of these products, such as methyl violet ketone and Litsea cubeba oil, exceeded international standards.

    野草清香

    胡桂珍望着一瓶茴香油发楞，这暗红色的液体呆在瓶子里，显得多么沉静，可是在胡桂珍心里却是翻腾不安。几天以前，桂林市出口公司交到芳香厂一个任务：提高茴香油的结晶度（茴香脑提纯）。这个任务当然也就落在了她——“化验员”的身上。
    这个任务对于胡桂珍来说，的确不是一件容易的事。胡桂珍原是个只有小学水平的制篦女工，今年春上，桂林市制篦厂改建为芳香厂以后，她才当了化验员。到市工业局化验室去学习了五天。以后胡桂珍就边干边学，在实践中确实也学到了一些东西，化验出了不少的香料。可是她还从来没有做过提高茴香油的结晶度的试验呢。她拿起这瓶茴香油摇晃了几下，然后把它倒进蒸馏瓶里去，想先测出它原有的结晶度再说。胡桂珍记得和广西师范学院化学系同学做过一次测定茴香油结晶度的试验，那次同学们写的配方都是英文，她一点也不懂，只记得要用冷却的方法才能得出结晶度。哪里来的冷却器呢？胡桂珍想了又想，忽然飞快地冲出了化验室，跑到街上买回来几支冰棍，就用冰棍来做冰冻剂。然后把火点着，过了一刻，液体开始上下流动起来，胡桂珍把它引了一些出来放在冰棍作成的冰冻器里，测出了它的结晶度是十二度。十二度，不行呀，她听厂里供销科的人说出口规格是十九至二十一度。她想：要提高结晶度，只有先去掉水分和杂质，水在摄氏一百度时沸腾，变成蒸气跑掉，杂质沉在底上，油的沸点就会更高。如果把温度继续加高，水分就会跑得更多……。如此下去，总会有一个温度蒸馏出来的油的结晶度会要高些。于是她守着蒸馏瓶，从摄氏一百度开始，每上升十度时，就引出来一些油放到“冰冻器”里冷却和测量结晶度。第一次是十二度；第二次是十四度；连续九次，胡桂珍发现在一百五十度和一百六十度时结晶度最好，达到十九度，芬芳四溢，清香馥郁。但她还不满意，又做了九次试验，结晶度不再增加。她不愿就此罢手，又连续几天不休息地作了二十多次试验。这个时候，厂长知道她已经提到十九度了，跑到她的化验室来，高兴地握着她的手说：“你已经超额完成规定的提纯度了，出口公司说十八度就行，十九度最好。”可是胡桂珍心里还在不满意自己呢。
    就是这个只有小学水平的胡桂珍，在短短的五个多月里，先后从七十多种野草中提炼出香料来，其中有几种产品如甲基紫罗兰酮、山苍籽油的质量都超过了国际水平。
