　　Chairman Mao held a major general's hand, looking at his sturdy body and healthy smiling face, examining him for a long time, as if recalling some past events.

　　"You are—" Chairman Mao slowly spoke these two words.

　　"My name is You Haoyang!" The major general replied excitedly.

　　"Ah! You Haoyang, You Haoyang! I remember, I remember!"

　　Chairman Mao was so happy, looking at You Haoyang with a face full of smiles, holding You Haoyang's hand even tighter!

　　On October 29th, when Chairman Mao received the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Major General You Haoyang's heart was pounding violently, and his face flushed again and again. He had so much to tell Chairman Mao!

　　Holding Chairman Mao's hand tightly, You Haoyang felt boundless warmth. Seeing that Chairman Mao's health was even better than before, You Haoyang felt boundless happiness! You Haoyang especially couldn't forget that, although he had been away from Chairman Mao for more than twenty years, Chairman Mao still recognized him.

　　It was the winter of 1935. The First and Third Army Corps of the Red First Front Army, led by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, crossed the snowy mountains and grasslands and entered Shaanxi, preparing to join forces with the Northern Shaanxi Red Army. Passing through Taibai Town and Wangjiajiao in the area bordering Shaanxi and Gansu, they suddenly engaged with Hu Zongnan's bandit troops. You Haoyang, who was serving as the platoon leader of the Party Central Committee Political Bureau's guard platoon at the time, was shot through the neck by a bullet in the battle to seize a mountain stronghold from the enemy. He and several other seriously wounded soldiers were temporarily moved to foxholes on the mountainside, which were relatively safe. At this time, the battle was still going on, and Chairman Mao and Comrade Zhou Enlai and others came to the battlefield despite the gunfire. When they walked to You Haoyang and the other wounded soldiers, they stopped immediately, examining their wounds like a loving mother and asking them how they were injured. The meticulous conversation between Chairman Mao and Comrade Zhou Enlai gave You Haoyang and the other wounded soldiers great comfort, and they suddenly felt the sharp pain in their wounds lessen.

　　Chairman Mao took out the army water bottle he carried with him, poured a cup of water, bent down and brought it to You Haoyang's mouth, and said with a smile to You Haoyang: "Drink it, kid, you'll feel better after drinking it." At this time, Chairman Mao and Comrade Zhou Enlai and others went to pick up some of the enemy's tattered overcoats and quilts and laid the stretcher thickly. Chairman Mao gently helped You Haoyang onto the stretcher, covered him with an overcoat, wrapped his bare feet in the overcoat, and then instructed the stretcher bearers: "His injury is very serious, take good care of him. The snow is deep and the road is slippery, go slower when going down the mountain!" Chairman Mao personally broke off some branches to camouflage the stretcher, and repeatedly told the stretcher bearers to pay attention to air defense and beware of enemy planes. Chairman Mao and Comrade Zhou Enlai kept waving their hands, watching the stretcher go down the mountain.

　　Four months later, You Haoyang was discharged from the hospital after recovering from his injuries. It was the spring when everything was recovering. When You Haoyang saw Chairman Mao again with infinite gratitude, Chairman Mao was once again so concerned about him, asking him about the treatment of his wounds. You Haoyang told Chairman Mao that the wound had healed quickly, but his feet had been frozen so badly that it took a long time to heal. Chairman Mao earnestly instructed You Haoyang that he should protect his feet well, because if they were frostbitten this year and not protected, they would still be frostbitten next year, and year after year, it would be troublesome to become a habitual recurrence. Chairman Mao also told You Haoyang that when his feet were too frozen, he should not wash them with hot water, as that would make them worse.

　　More than twenty years have passed, and the guard platoon leader You Haoyang of that year has now shouldered the heavy responsibility of commanding an army of tens of thousands of people. On the Long March, in the arduous years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the Liberation War, and on the Korean battlefield, in those days of fighting to the death with all kinds of enemies, whenever You Haoyang recalled Chairman Mao's care and teachings for him, he was filled with invincible strength. Today, when You Haoyang met our great leader again, he simply couldn't express his complex feelings. The feeling of being unable to repay the care of the Party and Chairman Mao, accompanied by many past events, surged into his heart.

　　In 1930, in the Jiangxi Central Soviet Area—You Haoyang's hometown—it was the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao that led a fifteen-year-old cowherd, the son of a poor peasant, onto the road of revolution. You Haoyang and his two elder brothers, with the desire to "follow Chairman Mao to join the army," joined the Red Army. During the Long March, You Haoyang's eldest brother, who stayed in his hometown to serve as the chairman of the village soviet, was soon captured and shot by the Kuomintang reactionaries who tried every means to extinguish the sparks of revolution. You Haoyang's second brother also gloriously sacrificed for the revolution after crossing the snowy mountains and grasslands with him on the Long March. Faced with the severe tests of those difficult years, under the kind care and teachings of our Party and our beloved Chairman Mao, the young revolutionary fighter You Haoyang overcame many difficult hurdles and strengthened his revolutionary will.

　　After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, You Haoyang left Chairman Mao's side. He accepted the new task assigned to him by the Party and left the guard platoon of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee, and successively served as the company commander, battalion commander, and regimental commander of the 358th Brigade of the Eighth Route Army. It was ten years later that he met Chairman Mao again. In these ten years of combat life, whenever You Haoyang encountered difficulties, he thought of the scene of Chairman Mao helping him onto the stretcher, and he thought of Chairman Mao's approachable and glorious image. This happy memory has more than once become the force that encouraged him to move forward.

　　The third time You Haoyang saw Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation War was at an important historical moment. At that time, Chairman Mao was leading the people of the whole country in the great cause of defending Yan'an and liberating all of China. You Haoyang and many of his comrades-in-arms were worried about the safety of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and had repeatedly suggested to their superiors that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao should leave Yan'an and northern Shaanxi as soon as possible. You Haoyang said anxiously: "Chairman Mao, as long as you cross the Yellow River, we will be relieved. When you get to the other side of the Yellow River, you can still command us to fight!" However, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, in order to stabilize the war situation in northern Shaanxi and boost the people's confidence in the struggle, had been insisting on staying in northern Shaanxi, laying the foundation for the final victory of the Liberation War. Chairman Mao's rock-solid confidence in the revolution and his great and glorious image of always sharing weal and woe with the people not only powerfully inspired You Haoyang's courage to fight in those years, but also is a huge force that will always guide him to fight forward.

　　More than ten years have passed, You Haoyang and his comrades-in-arms returned triumphantly from Korea and returned to Chairman Mao's side. You Haoyang couldn't restrain the excitement in his heart. He thought of how the Chinese People's Volunteers held high the red banner of Chairman Mao's military thought, pierced the American paper tiger on the Korean battlefield, and achieved brilliant victories, and he thought of how the Volunteers, according to Chairman Mao's instructions to love every mountain, every river, every blade of grass, and every tree in Korea, established immortal fighting friendship in fighting side by side with the Korean people... All this made You Haoyang deeply feel that it was precisely Chairman Mao's great thought that radiated infinite glory and great power in the Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.

　　In the several nights after the happy meeting, You Haoyang excitedly reviewed many of Chairman Mao's teachings. He deeply realized how glorious it is to be a people's soldier in the Mao Zedong era! However, what You Haoyang thought about more was how small his, a cowherd who had embarked on the road of revolution after being cultivated by the Party and Chairman Mao for a long time, contribution to the Party, the motherland, and the people was! At this time, You Haoyang was both excited and uneasy. How could he repay the Party and Chairman Mao's incomparable care? He made up his mind to make greater contributions to the great cause of building and defending the motherland in the future.

    将军的记忆
    新华社记者　袁木　于民生
    毛主席握着一位少将的手，看着他那结实的身体，看着他那健康的笑脸，久久地打量着他，仿佛记起了什么往事似的。
      “你是——”毛主席慢慢地说着这两个字。
    “我叫游好扬！”少将激动地回答。
    “啊！游好扬，游好扬！认识，认识！”
    毛主席是那样地高兴，满脸笑容地看着游好扬，把游好扬的手握得更紧了！
    在10月29日毛主席接见志愿军代表团的时候，游好扬少将的心在不停地剧烈跳动，他的脸上泛起了一阵又一阵的红光。他有多少话语要告诉毛主席啊！
    紧紧地握着毛主席的手，游好扬感到无比的温暖，看到毛主席的身体比过去更加健康，游好扬感到无比的幸福！游好扬尤其不能忘怀的是，虽然他离开了毛主席身边已有二十多年，毛主席还能认识他。
    那是1935年冬天的事情，党中央和毛主席率领的红一方面军的一、三军团，走过了雪山草地，进入了陕西，准备同陕北红军会师。途经陕、甘交界的太白镇、王家角一带，突然和胡宗南匪军打上了。当时在毛主席身边担任党中央政治局警卫排排长的游好扬，在夺取敌人一个山头阵地的战斗中，一颗枪弹穿过了游好扬的脖子，他和几个重伤员一起，暂时转移到比较安全的山腰的散兵坑里。这时，战斗还在继续进行，毛主席和周恩来同志等冒着枪声来到了战场。当他们走到游好扬和其他伤员面前时，立刻停了下来，像慈母般地察看着他们的伤口，询问着他们是怎样受伤的。毛主席和周恩来同志体贴入微的谈话，使游好扬和其他伤员得到很大的安慰，他们都骤然感到伤口的剧疼减轻了。
    毛主席取出带在身边的那只军用水壶，倒了一杯水，俯身送到游好扬嘴边，笑着对游好扬说：“喝吧，小鬼，喝了会舒服些的。”这时，毛主席又和周恩来同志等一起，去拾了一些敌人的破大衣和破被子，把担架铺得厚厚的。毛主席轻轻把游好扬扶上担架，给他盖上大衣，把那双赤脚裹进大衣里，然后关照担架队员们：“他的伤口很重，要多照顾他。雪深路滑，下山的时候，要走慢一些！”毛主席一面亲手折下一些树枝，把担架伪装起来，一面再三嘱咐担架队员们注意防空，小心敌人的飞机。毛主席和周恩来同志一直招着手，目送担架到山下。
    四个月以后，游好扬伤愈出院已是万物复生的春天了。当游好扬怀着无限感激的心情重见毛主席的时候，毛主席又是那样的关怀他，问他伤口医治的情形。游好扬告诉毛主席，伤口很快就治好了，只是两只脚因为冻得太厉害医治了很久才好。毛主席十分恳切地叮嘱游好扬，应该好好保护脚，因为今年冻坏了不注意保护，明年仍旧会冻坏，年复一年，成为习惯性的复发症就麻烦了。毛主席还告诉游好扬，脚冻得太厉害的时候，不要用热水洗，那样会越洗越坏。
    事情过了二十多年，当年的警卫排长游好扬，今天已经肩负着指挥万人大军的重担。在那长征的道路上，在抗日战争的艰苦年代里，在解放战争中和朝鲜战场上，在那些同各种各样的敌人作殊死斗争的日子里，每当游好扬回想起毛主席对他的关怀和教导，他浑身就充满了不可战胜的力量。今天，当游好扬再次会见我们的伟大领袖的时候，他简直没有办法表达出自己的复杂感情。对党和毛主席的关怀报答不尽的心情，伴随着许多往事，涌上了他的心头。
    1930年，在江西中央苏区——游好扬的家乡，是党和毛主席的指引，把一个贫农的儿子、十五岁的放牛娃娃，领上了革命的道路。游好扬同他的大哥和二哥一起，怀着“跟毛主席当兵去”的意愿，参加了红军。长征期间，留在家乡担任村苏维埃主席的游好扬的大哥，不久就被千方百计企图扑灭革命星火的国民党反动派捉去枪杀了。游好扬的二哥同他一起在长征的道路上走过了雪山草地以后，也为革命而光荣地牺牲了。面临着那些艰苦岁月里的严峻考验，在我们的党和敬爱的毛主席的亲切关怀和教导下，年青的革命战士游好扬度过了许多困难的关头，坚定了革命的意志。
    1937年抗日战争开始以后，游好扬离开了毛主席的身边。他接受党分配给他的新任务，离开党中央政治局警卫排，先后担任八路军三五八旅的连长、营长和团长的职务。他再一次会见毛主席已经是十年以后的事情。在这十年的战斗生活中，每当游好扬遇到困难的时候，他就想起了毛主席当年扶他上担架的情景，想起了毛主席那种平易近人的光辉形象。这种幸福的回忆，曾经不止一次地成为鼓舞他前进的力量。
    游好扬第三次见到毛主席的时候，中国人民解放战争正处在一个重要的历史时刻。那时，毛主席正在领导全国人民进行保卫延安和解放全中国的伟大事业。游好扬同他的许多战友担心党中央和毛主席的安全，曾经多次向上级建议，希望党中央和毛主席尽快地离开延安和陕北。游好扬焦急地说：“毛主席啊，只要您老人家过了黄河，我们就放心了。您到了黄河的对岸，一样地也可以指挥我们作战呀！”但是，党中央和毛主席为了稳定陕北的战局和鼓舞人民的斗争信心，却一直坚持在陕北，奠定了解放战争最后胜利的大局。毛主席对革命的那种坚如磐石的胜利信心，他那永远和人民同甘苦共患难的伟大光辉形象，不仅在当年曾经有力地鼓舞游好扬的斗争勇气，并且是永远地引导他战斗前进的巨大力量。
    又是十多年过去了，游好扬和他的战友们从朝鲜凯旋归来，又回到了毛主席的身边。游好扬怎么也抑制不住内心的激动。他想起了中国人民志愿军怎样高举着毛主席军事思想的红旗在朝鲜战场上戳穿了美国纸老虎，取得了辉煌的胜利，想起了志愿军怎样根据毛主席要热爱朝鲜的一山、一水、一草、一木的指示，在同朝鲜人民并肩作战中建立了不朽的战斗友谊；……这一切都使得游好扬深深地感到，正是毛主席的伟大思想，在中国人民抗美援朝运动中发出了无限的光辉和伟大力量。
    在幸福的会见以后的这几个夜晚，游好扬激动地重温了毛主席的许多教导。他无比深刻地体会到，作为毛泽东时代的一个人民战士，是何等的光荣！但是，游好扬想得更多的是，他，一个经过党和毛主席长期培养而走上革命道路的放牛娃，对党、对祖国、对人民的贡献，又是多么的微小！这时，游好扬是既兴奋而又不安，怎么样才能报答党和毛主席的无比关怀呢？他下定决心，今后要在建设祖国和保卫祖国的伟大事业中，作出更大的贡献。
