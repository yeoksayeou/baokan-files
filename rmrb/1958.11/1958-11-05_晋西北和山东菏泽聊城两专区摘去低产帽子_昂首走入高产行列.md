Northwestern Shanxi and Heze and Liaocheng Prefectures of Shandong Shed Low-Yield Labels
Strut into the Ranks of High-Yield

(Our report) A momentous change has taken place this year in the mountainous area of northwestern Shanxi Province, once known for its barrenness. A low-yield area has risen to become a high-yield area, and a grain-deficient mountain has been transformed into a rice-and-grain mountain.

Recently, news of unprecedented bumper harvests in agriculture has been constantly pouring in from northwestern Shanxi. The 60,000 people of Wuzhai County, after a year of arduous struggle, achieved a unit yield of more than 800 jin, crossing the "Yangtze River." The neighboring Shenchi and Kelan counties, through mutual promotion and collaborative support, made a joint leap forward, with yields per mu more than nine times higher, exceeding 500 jin. The formerly known "brother sufferers," Hequ County and Baode County, achieved yields of 400 jin per mu, shedding their low-yield labels. The impoverished state of "Hequ and Baode, nine years out of ten bring no harvest, women dig for wild herbs, men go outside the pass" is gone forever. According to recent harvest results from various places, the average yield per mu in the entire northwestern Shanxi region exceeds 400 jin. The average yield per mu and total output have increased several times compared to last year. Although many people not long ago doubted whether this place could leap forward, facts show that the era of low yields here has ended.

The northwestern Shanxi region is characterized by undulating peaks, overlapping hills, and crisscrossing gullies, comprising eight counties including Hequ, Baode, Pianguan, Shenchi, and Xingxian. This region, bordering the Yellow River to the west and leaning against the Great Wall to the north, with the Guan Cen and Lüliang Mountains to the east and south, is an old revolutionary base area with a glorious history. However, the natural conditions here are very poor, with sparse population, imbalanced climate, and a long-standing practice of extensive cultivation with low yields, resulting in extremely low output and difficult lives for farmers. The Party committees and farmers in various parts of northwestern Shanxi have implemented the "Basic Farmland" system, practicing less planting for high yields and greater harvests. The average cultivated land area per person has been reduced from more than ten mu to around four mu. Soil erosion has been controlled on nearly ten million mu of land, and the land has been initially terraced. A major offensive was launched on the six keys to increased production—water, fertilizer, soil, density, seeds, and tools—and concentrated manpower and resources were used to implement intensive cultivation, resulting in significant achievements in grain production.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, -- The two low-yield prefectures of Heze and Liaocheng in Shandong Province, traditionally known for their extensive farming and low yields, have leaped to the forefront of high-yield areas this year, achieving a complete turnaround. The "low-yield theory" and "condition theory" have been refuted by these living facts one by one. This year, Heze Prefecture's wheat yield reached 216 jin per mu despite months without rain; millet and corn yields both broke the 1,000-jin mark per mu, increasing the single-yield by more than tenfold compared to the highest historical year of 1956; sorghum and soybeans, which previously yielded a maximum of just over a hundred jin, now yield 520 jin per mu for sorghum and 300 jin for soybeans, with a mixed grain yield of 704 jin per mu. Liaocheng Prefecture's grain yield reached 636 jin per mu, with early autumn crops also exceeding the 1,000-jin mark. The grain yield per mu in Fan County and Shou Zhang reached more than 5,000 jin, an increase of 20 to 30 times. Calculated per capita, the average reached more than 9,000 jin.

The cotton production in these two prefectures has also achieved a double leap forward. Heze Prefecture planted more than 1,024,000 mu of cotton, with an estimated yield of 158 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of more than eight times compared to last year; Liaocheng Prefecture planted more than 3,687,000 mu of cotton, with an estimated yield of 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of more than three times compared to last year. In the cotton-producing areas of Gaotang and Linqing, the average yield is expected to reach about 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu.

These two prefectures are located in the western Shandong Plain. In the past, due to extensive farming and low yields, the average yield was only over a hundred jin per mu. The main reason for achieving an unprecedented and comprehensive bumper harvest this year is the victory of the socialist general line and the great victory of the rectification movement, which fundamentally changed the habit of extensive farming and low yields. After the rectification movement in Heze Prefecture, Party organizations at all levels saw a new situation of cadres going to the fields, secretaries taking the lead, Party members serving as pioneers, offices going to construction sites, and instructions being implemented overnight, with everyone working together, resulting in a production upsurge. The broad masses displayed the soaring enthusiasm to move mountains and fill seas. In the winter of last year and the spring of this year alone, they dug 166,700 wells, built more than 27,700 ponds and reservoirs, constructed more than 7,000,000 mu of ditch and furrow fields, terraced fields, and embankment fields, over 16,000,000 mu of large-earth furrow fields, expanded paddy fields by more than 31,000,000 mu, transformed more than 2,000,000 mu of saline-alkali land, deep-plowed more than 21,000,000 mu of land, and pressed sand to replace soil on more than 240,000 mu. Heze Prefecture basically completed the original two-year furrow field project plan in just twenty days. Juancheng County had 100,000 mu of barren land with drifting sand, but after transformation, it has become a large granary with double-thousand-jin millet this year. In Dingtao County, corn satellites with more than 8,000 jin and millet satellites with more than 11,000 jin were launched in saline-alkali land that had not yielded any harvest in previous years. After the establishment of the People's Communes, people's enthusiasm became even greater. In order to completely change the historical habit of extensive cultivation, they fought hard for two months, transforming 180,000 dense-planting seeders, 217,000 deep-plowing plows, 268,000 deep-plowing rope-traction machines, and installing ball bearings on most of the large and small carts.

The Eight-Character Charter for agriculture—water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, pest control, engineering, and management—has been universally promoted in these two prefectures, which is the second reason for the complete turnaround in agriculture. All the high-yielding millet and corn satellite fields in these two prefectures have been irrigated five times, and general fields are irrigated three times; the amount of fertilizer applied has increased from 1,000 or 2,000 jin in the past to 20,000 or 30,000 jin, with 150,000 to 200,000 jin for high-yield fields and 1,000,000 jin for satellite fields; the depth of deep plowing has generally increased from three or four inches in the past to more than one foot; in terms of dense planting, the past practice of "two-eight ridges" with 80% seedlings has now all reached full seedlings. In the past, millet was planted with wide ridges and sparse seedlings, with 20,000 to 30,000 plants per mu, but this year, it is generally planted with narrow ridges, dense planting, and sparse seedlings, with more than 70,000 plants per mu, 150,000 plants for high-yield fields, and 250,000 plants for "satellite fields." At the same time, most areas have realized large-earth furrow fields, with small furrow fields resembling vegetable gardens, and the land leveled, allowing rainwater to be intercepted and stored on the spot, preventing runoff. It is precisely because of such a great improvement in the farming system that there has been such a great leap in output.

At present, the Party and government leaders and the field corps of the People's Communes in this region are advancing victoriously. They have deeply realized from a year of practice the truth that "how bold people are, how productive the land is, output depends on what people say, nature is subject to people's control." Therefore, in this autumn's wheat planting campaign, they have mustered greater enthusiasm and tenacity, determined to strive for an even greater leap in grain and cotton production next year.

    晋西北和山东菏泽聊城两专区摘去低产帽子
    昂首走入高产行列
    本报讯　向以贫瘠著称的山西省晋西北山区，今年发生了巨变，低产区上升为高产区，缺粮山变成了米粮山。
    最近以来，晋西北史无前例的农业大丰收喜讯不断传来。五寨县六万人民苦战一年，单位产量达到八百多斤，渡过“长江”；毗邻的神池、岢岚县，经过互相促进、协作支援，共同跃进，亩产量都翻了九番，超过五百斤。昔日被人们称之为“难兄难弟”的河曲县、保德县，亩产到四百斤，摘掉了低产帽子。“河曲、保德州，十年九不收，女人挖苦菜，男人走口外”的贫困面貌从此一去不复返。据各地最近收打的结果，晋西北全区平均亩产超过了四百斤。平均亩产和总产超过了去年数倍。尽管有许多人不久前还怀疑这里是否能跃上去，但事实表明，这里的低产年代已经结束了。
    晋西北地区峰峦起伏，丘陵重迭，沟壑纵横交错，有河曲、保德、偏关、神池、兴县等八个县。这个地区西临黄河、北靠长城，东面和南面是管岑和吕梁山脉，是有着光荣史实的革命老根据地。但是，这里自然条件很差，地广人稀，气候不调，自古沿袭着广种薄收的耕作习惯，因此，产量极低，农民生活很困难。晋西北各地党委和农民贯彻执行“基本农田”制度，实行少种高产多收，每人平均种植耕地面积由原来的十亩以上缩减到四亩左右，在近一千万亩土地面积上控制了水土流失，初步实现了地埂化，大攻特攻水、肥、土、密、种、工六道增产关，集中人力物力实行精耕细作，因此粮食生产取得重大的成绩。　（杨义）
    据新华社济南电　历来被称为耕作粗放、广种薄收的山东省菏泽、聊城两个低产专区，今年粮棉跃居到高产的先进行列，来了一个彻底大翻身。“低产论”、“条件论”在这活生生的事实面前，一一被驳倒了。今年菏泽专区的小麦在数月无雨的情况下亩产达到二百一十六斤；谷子、玉米亩产都突破千斤关，比历史最高年产量1956年单产翻了十一番；高粱、大豆，过去最多收百十斤，而今年高粱亩产五百二十斤，大豆三百斤，粮食混合亩产量达到七百零四斤。聊城专区粮食亩产达到六百三十六斤，其中早秋作物，也突破了千斤关。范县、寿张的粮食亩产量都达到五千多斤，增产二、三十倍。按人口计算，平均每人达到九千多斤。
    这两个专区的棉花也取得双跃进。菏泽专区种棉一百零二点四万多亩，亩产皮棉可达一百五十八斤，比去年增产八倍多；聊城专区种棉三百六十八点七万多亩，亩产皮棉可达一百五十斤，比去年增产三倍多。高唐、临清棉产区，预计平均每亩能收籽棉千斤左右。
    这两个专区地处鲁西大平原。在过去由于耕作粗放、广种薄收，平均每亩只收百多斤。今年所以能获得史无前例的全面大丰收，主要是社会主义总路线的胜利，整风运动的伟大胜利，从根本上改变了广种薄收，耕作粗放的习惯。菏泽专区经过整风运动，各级党组织出现了干部下田，书记挂帅，党员打先锋，办公室下工地，指示不过夜，上下一股劲的新局面，因此，出现了生产高潮，广大群众发出了移山填海的冲天干劲。仅去冬今春就打井十六点六七万眼，修建塘圩水库二万七千七百多座，沟洫畦田、台田、圩田七百多万亩，大地畦田一千六百多万亩，扩大水田面积三千一百多万亩，改造碱地二百多万亩，深翻地二千一百多万亩，压沙换土二十四万多亩。菏泽专区原定两年的畦田工程计划，二十天就基本完成了。鄄城县有十万亩飞沙不毛之地，经改造后，今年一跃成为谷子双千斤的大粮仓。定陶县在历年不收的盐碱地中，放出了八千斤以上的玉米卫星和一万一千斤以上的谷子卫星。人民公社建立以后，人们的干劲更大了，他们为了彻底改变耕作粗放的历史习惯，奋战了两个月，改造密植耧十八万部，深耕犁二十一万七千部，深耕绳索牵引机二十六万八千部，大车、小车大部分安装了滚珠轴承。
    农业水、肥、土、种、密、害、工、管八字宪法在这两个专区普遍推行，是农业彻底翻身的第二个原因。这两个专区所有的谷子、玉米高额卫星田都实行了五水，一般田是三水；施肥量由过去一、两千斤，提高到两、三万斤，丰产田十五万到二十万斤，卫星田一百万斤；深翻地由过去三、四寸深，普遍提高到一尺以上；密植方面，过去是“二八垄”八成苗，现在全部达到全苗。谷子过去是宽垄留墩苗，每亩两、三万株，今年普遍是窄垄密植疏留苗，每亩七万多株，丰产田十五万株、“卫星田”二十五万株。同时大部分地区已经实现大地畦田化，小畦田菜园化、土地平整化、雨水可以就地拦蓄，不发生径流。正是由于耕作制度有了这样大的改进，所以产量才有这样大的飞跃。
    目前，这个地区的党政领导和各人民公社的野战兵团，正乘胜前进。他们从一年的实践中深深体会到“人有多大胆，地有多大产，产量听人说，自然受人管”的真理，因此，在今秋种麦运动中，鼓起了更大的干劲和钻劲，坚决为明年粮棉产量更大的飞跃而奋斗。
