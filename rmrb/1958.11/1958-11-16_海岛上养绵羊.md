Raising Sheep on Islands

Zhejiang Province has extended the raising of Hu sheep to the Zhoushan Islands, where sheep farming had never been practiced before. In early August 1956, the Xiubei Agricultural Cooperative in Daishan County, Zhoushan Prefecture, imported twelve Hu sheep from the mainland. By the second half of this year, the number had grown to forty-eight, a threefold increase in two years. The growth and development of the sheep are also very good. Male sheep aged one to one and a half years weigh between ninety and one hundred thirty *jin* (approximately 45 to 65 kilograms). According to local experience, there are many favorable conditions for raising sheep on islands: there is abundant forage grass available for feed, and the quality is good. In particular, the climate is mild in winter and cool in summer, suitable for sheep. Although the lack of water resources is a disadvantage for island sheep farming, this difficulty can be overcome by building pools to store water.

    海岛上养绵羊
    浙江省把湖羊推广到从来没有养过绵羊的舟山群岛。舟山专区岱山县秀北农业社在1956年8月初从大陆输入湖羊十二只，到今年下半年已发展到四十八只了，两年来增加三倍。羊只的生长发育也很好，一岁到一岁半的公羊，体重九十到一百三十斤。根据这里的经验，海岛养羊的有利条件并不少：海岛上可做饲料用的牧草较多，而且质量较好；特别是气候冬暖夏凉，适合羊的生活。海岛养羊虽然有水源缺乏的缺点，但是这个困难可以用筑池蓄水的办法克服。
