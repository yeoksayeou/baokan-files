    Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: Indigenous iron can play a greater role in the national economy. It can not only be used for steelmaking but also for making excellent castings. The Mechanical Manufacturing and Technology Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building recently conducted research and experiments at the Beijing Universal Machinery Factory. It was found that high-sulfur indigenous iron can be used to make high-grade castings with performance close to ductile iron, and without the need for magnesium as a spheroidizing agent.
    The State Technology Commission believes that this research result is of great significance to the national economy. In this way, local "small-scale indigenous" machinery factories can use indigenous iron produced by local "small-scale indigenous" iron and steel plants to manufacture various machines. Large machine manufacturing plants can also adopt this method to obtain abundant sources of materials.
    The general characteristics of indigenous iron are: relatively high sulfur content, low carbon, silicon, and manganese content, and variable phosphorus content depending on the local mineral resources. That indigenous iron can be used to make steel has already been proven by the experiences presented at the recent steelmaking meeting held by the Ministry of Metallurgy in Tianjin and the steel casting meeting held by the First Ministry of Machine Building in Shanghai. As for its use in casting, there is no mature experience. The reason is that some people still hold the old view that indigenous iron cannot be used as castings, let alone as ductile iron. At present, most machinery factories use desulfurization methods to turn white cast iron into gray cast iron before making castings.
    The Mechanical Manufacturing and Technology Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building conducted production-scale experiments with high-sulfur indigenous iron (up to 1.6% sulfur content). The results of the experiments showed that castings made of indigenous iron, although white iron during casting, achieved performance similar to ductile iron after six to eight hours of annealing. For example, the tensile strength of ordinary cast iron is only 15 to 30 kg per square millimeter, the tensile strength of ductile iron is 45 to 70 kg per square millimeter, while the tensile strength of annealed indigenous iron castings averages around 45 kg per square millimeter. The toughness, hardness, and impact resistance are also better than ordinary cast iron, approaching ductile iron. This is because the high sulfur in indigenous iron promotes the spheroidization of graphite, playing the role of spheroidizing agent – magnesium – in ductile iron; it also shortens the annealing time, thus turning the harmful factor of high sulfur into a beneficial factor.
    The high-speed development of China's machinery industry requires vigorous promotion of the application of ductile iron. However, the difficulty encountered in promoting ductile iron is the need to use magnesium as a spheroidizing agent. The supply of this metal currently cannot meet the demand. Since high-sulfur indigenous iron can be used to make ductile iron without the need for magnesium as a spheroidizing agent, this is of great significance to the national economy.

### 土铁长腿　机械插翅  科学研究证明：高硫铁可做机械铸件

    科学研究证明：高硫铁可做机械铸件
    据新华社16日讯　土铁可以在国民经济中发挥更大的作用，不但可以炼钢，而且可以作出很好的铸件。第一机械工业部机械制造与工艺科学研究院最近在北京通用机械厂进行研究试验，用含硫量高的土铁可以作出性能接近球墨铸铁的高级铸件，而且还不要镁做球化剂。
    国家技术委员会认为这个研究成果对国民经济有很大的意义。这样，地方上的“小土群”机械厂可以利用当地“小土群”钢铁厂生产的土铁来制造各种机械。大型的机器制造厂也可以采取这种方法取得丰富的材料来源。
    一般土铁的特点是：含硫量较高，含碳、矽、锰量都较低，含磷量则因各地矿源不同而有高有低。土铁可以用来炼钢，已经为最近冶金部在天津召开的炼钢会议和一机部在上海开的铸钢会议提出的经验得到证明。至于用在铸造方面，还没有成熟的经验。原因是有些人还抱着旧的观点，认为土铁不能作铸件，更不可能作球墨铸铁。目前有些机械工厂大都是用脱硫的办法，使白口铁变成灰口铁，然后才做铸件的。
    一机部机械制造与工艺科学研究院是用含硫量高的土铁（最高的达1.6％）进行生产规模的试验的。试验的结果表明，用土铁所作的铸件，虽然在铸造时为白口，但经过六到八小时的退火以后，便得到与球墨铸铁相似的性能。比如：一般铸铁的抗拉强度不过每平方公厘十五到三十公斤，球墨铸铁的抗拉强度为每平方公厘四十五到七十公斤，而退火后的土铁铸件，其抗拉强度平均在每平方公厘四十五公斤上下，韧性、硬度和耐冲击性也较一般铸铁为好，接近球墨铸铁。这是因为土铁中的高硫促使石墨球化，起了球墨铸铁中球化剂——镁的作用；同时也缩短了退火时间，从而把高硫这一有害因素转为有利因素。
    我国机械工业高速度发展必须要大力推广球墨铸铁的应用。但是在推广球墨铸铁的工作中碰到的困难是要用镁作球化剂。这一金属目前还供不应求。既然用高硫土铁可以做出球墨铸铁，而且不要镁作球化剂，这对国民经济具有很大意义。
