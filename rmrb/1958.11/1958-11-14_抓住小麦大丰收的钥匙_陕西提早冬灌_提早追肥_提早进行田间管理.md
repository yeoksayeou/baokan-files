This newspaper's correspondent commented from Xi'an on the 13th: This year, farmers in Shaanxi Province started winter wheat field management a month earlier, which is another victorious advance for farmers across the province to promote a bumper wheat harvest next year.

This year, the quality of the more than 24 million mu of wheat sown in Shaanxi Province is good. Deep plowing, fertilization, and close planting measures have basically met the requirements of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. After the wheat seedlings emerged, farmers throughout the province generally carried out seedling inspection and replanting. Some people's communes even classified and ranked all wheat fields, designated special personnel to manage them, added water and fertilizer, and eliminated third-class seedlings within a specified period. Currently, counties in the Yulin area of Shaanxi have started winter irrigation, watering more than 100,000 mu of land every day, and it is estimated that all wheat fields will be watered within half a month. Farmers in the Guanzhong area are also working hard on ridging. According to incomplete statistics, more than 9 million mu have been ridged, accounting for about 65% of the total area of ​​irrigated wheat fields. Irrigation areas such as Jinghui, Weihui, and Lihui have also generally changed large ridges to small ridges and long ridges to short ridges to improve irrigation quality. Counties such as Baoji, Hu County, Wugong, and Zhouzhi mobilized the masses to launch a surprise campaign to accumulate and produce fertilizer, planning to apply 20,000 to 100,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer per mu of wheat field.

In previous years, after wheat was sown, most wheat fields were no longer processed or fertilized, and topdressing and winter irrigation of a few wheat fields were often delayed until December, which greatly affected the tillering ability of wheat seedlings. Therefore, there were many third-class wheat fields every year, with a seedling deficiency rate of 10%-30%. According to the experience of farmers in various places: the degree of wheat yield increase is greatly related to the number of ears per mu, and the number of ears depends on effective tillering in winter. If field management is strengthened in winter to ensure sufficient moisture and nutrients in the soil, wheat tillering will increase. Next year, Shaanxi Province plans to increase wheat production by four to five times compared to this year, and the Guanzhong area aims to achieve a yield of about 1,500 jin per mu. To achieve this yield target, there must be more than 1.5 million ears per mu, and the sowing amount of wheat fields in various places this year is generally more than 30 jin, with about 500,000 seedlings per mu, which requires each plant to have at least three or more effective tillers. Therefore, in terms of cultivation technology, we must try our best to promote early tillering of wheat and inhibit late tillering. (Late tillers are mostly not effective ears, consume nutrients, and affect ventilation and light.)

In order to promote wheat tillering before winter, various places are now applying seedling fertilizer to wheat fields one month earlier than in previous years. According to experimental observations by agricultural research departments: wheat plants applied with seedling fertilizer tiller 2.45 times before winter, while those not applied with seedling fertilizer tiller 1.69 times. This shows the important role of applying seedling fertilizer. There is a folk saying in Guanzhong: "Applying 'gold' in November, 'silver' in December, and soil in January," meaning that the earlier the topdressing is applied, the better, because most farm fertilizers are slow-acting fertilizers and decompose slowly. If applied too late, they will not play their due role when the wheat tillers. For this reason, not only has the amount of topdressing fertilizer been increased this year, but the time for topdressing has also been advanced. The masses in Baoji County formed an army of 100,000 people to launch a surprise campaign to accumulate fertilizer, planning to accumulate 16 billion jin of fertilizer in November, and adopted the method of accumulating and transporting simultaneously, and have now completed 30% of the total task. Zhouzhi County has divided all the labor force participating in agricultural production in the county into specialized divisions, divided into four war zones to carry out the fertilizer accumulation and topdressing movement, and has accumulated 2.7 billion jin of fertilizer, planning to apply 100,000 to 200,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer per mu. In the fertilizer accumulation movement, various places also criticized the erroneous argument that "wheat was applied with a lot of base fertilizer this year, so there is no need for topdressing" through debates. According to the wheat growth and development law, the amount of fertilizer required before winter should account for one-half of the total fertilizer requirement. According to surveys: wheat fields with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu in Shaanxi Province this year applied more than 50,000 jin of farm fertilizer per mu. Next year, the wheat yield in various places is required to reach 1,500 to 2,000 jin per mu, while the average fertilizer application this year is only 20,000 to 30,000 jin. Therefore, a large amount of topdressing is still necessary this winter and next spring.

Currently, winter irrigation has begun in northern Shaanxi, and large-scale canals in Guanzhong will also be released in succession recently. Although farmers who carry out winter irrigation have no doubt about the yield-increasing benefits of winter irrigation, they still lack experience in the yield-increasing extent of early winter irrigation. Recently, the masses in Xuetuan Township in Wugong County, Xiwu Township and Buzhai Township in Xingping County used examples of winter irrigation experiments conducted in their localities over the years to promote the benefits of early winter irrigation to the surrounding masses. According to the experimental results of these townships, wheat seedlings with early winter irrigation tiller more, have more and deeper roots, and grow stronger. The average yield per mu is 16%-20% higher. These promotions have attracted the attention of the surrounding masses, and they are now focusing on preparing for early winter irrigation. However, some people also believe that there is a lot of rain this year, so there is no need for winter irrigation. After being discovered by relevant departments, they were promptly criticized and corrected, and the necessity of winter irrigation this year was analyzed from objective conditions. According to years of experimental observations: the total water consumption of wheat throughout its growth period is 270 cubic meters, and winter water consumption accounts for 24%, equivalent to 105 mm of natural rainfall. At present, although the rainfall in various places is close to this standard, if runoff, evaporation, and soil particle infiltration are subtracted, it is probably less than half that can be supplied to wheat seedlings for absorption. At the same time, the above quota is the water consumption during the past shallow plowing, and does not include the water stored for next spring. Judging from this year's conditions of deep plowing and close planting, the existing rainfall is still not enough, and winter irrigation must be used to supplement its deficiencies.

According to the phenomenon that the ground is prone to crusting and cracking after winter irrigation in previous years, farmers in various places are preparing to carry out winter hoeing, winter harrowing, and winter raking immediately after winter irrigation to loosen the soil, preserve moisture, prevent cold, and protect seedlings.

Due to the high density and wide sowing width of wheat seedlings in various places this year, the masses in Baoji, Wugong and other counties have also created a small hoe suitable for garden-style use. The quality of hoeing is very good and is welcomed by the surrounding masses. In addition, Qian County, Chaoyi and other counties combined seedling inspection and replanting with winter hoeing to prevent and control diseases and insect pests, so that wheat seedlings can be strong and safe through the winter during the seedling stage.

    抓住小麦大丰收的钥匙
    陕西提早冬灌  提早追肥  提早进行田间管理
    本报西安13日电　记者评述陕西省提早开展麦田冬季管理的意义说：今年，陕西省农民提早一个月开展小麦田间管理工作，这是全省农民为促进明年小麦大丰收的又一次胜利进军。
    今年，陕西省播种的两千四百多万亩小麦，质量良好。深耕、施肥和密植等措施，都基本上达到了中共陕西省委要求。在麦苗出土后，全省农民普遍进行了查苗补苗，有些地区的人民公社，还把所有的麦田分类排队，指定专人管理，加水加肥，限期消灭三类苗。现在，陕西榆林专区各县已开始进行冬灌，每天浇地十万多亩，估计半月内即可将全部麦田浇完。关中地区的农民也正在紧张地进行打畦工作，据不完全统计，各地已打畦九百多万亩，占水地麦田总面积的65％左右。泾惠、渭惠和洛惠等渠灌区还普遍改大畦为小畦，改长畦为短畦，提高灌溉质量。宝鸡、鄠县、武功、盩厔等县发动群众突击积肥、造肥，计划每亩麦田施追肥两万至十万斤。
    往年小麦下种后，大部分麦田不再加工加肥，少数麦田追肥、冬灌也往往要拖到12月进行，大大影响了麦苗的分蘖能力。因此，每年都有不少的三类麦田，缺苗率达10％—30％。根据各地农民的经验：小麦增产的程度与每亩的穗数关系很大，而穗数的多少又决定于冬季的有效分蘖。如果在冬季加强田间管理，使土壤中的水分充足、养分丰富，小麦的分蘖就会增多。明年陕西省的小麦产量计划要比今年增加四、五倍，关中地区亩产要达到一千五百斤左右。要实现这个产量指标，每亩必须有一百五十万穗以上，而今年各地的麦田播种量一般都在三十斤以上，每亩出苗五十万株左右，这就要求每株至少有三个以上的有效分蘖。因此，当前在栽培技术上，必须尽量促进小麦早期分蘖，抑制后期分蘖。（后期分蘖多半不是有效穗子，消耗养分，影响通风透光。）
    为促进小麦冬前分蘖，现在各地较往年提前一个月，给麦田追施苗肥。根据农业研究部门的试验观察：小麦追施苗肥，冬前每株分蘖二点四五个，不施苗肥每株分蘖一点六九个。由此可见追施苗肥的重要作用。关中有句民谚说：“十一月上‘金’十二月上‘银’正月上土”，意思是施追肥愈早愈好，因为农家肥料多为迟效肥，分解较慢，上的太晚，在小麦分蘖时就起不到应有的作用。为此，全省各地今年不但增加了追肥数量，而且提早了追肥的时间。宝鸡县群众组成十万大军突击积肥，计划在11月份积肥一百六十亿斤，并且采取边积边运的办法，目前已完成总任务30％。盩厔县已把全县参加农业生产的全部劳力进行了专业分工，划分四个战区开展积肥追肥运动，现已积肥二十七亿斤，计划每亩追肥十至二十万斤。各地在积肥运动中，还通过辩论形式批判了那些认为“今年小麦施底肥多，不需要追肥”的错误论调，按照小麦生长发育规律，冬前需肥量要占总需肥量的二分之一，根据调查：今年陕西省亩产千斤以上的小麦丰产田，每亩施用农家肥料五万斤以上，明年各地的小麦亩产要求达到一千五至两千斤。而今年的施肥量平均只有两三万斤。因此今冬明春仍然必须大量追肥。
    现在，陕北地区已开始冬灌，关中各大型渠道也将在最近陆续放水。冬灌的农民对于冬灌的增产效益虽然置信不疑，可是对于早冬灌的增产程度还缺乏经验。最近武功县薛团乡、兴平县西吴乡、埠寨乡等地群众，分别以当地历年来所作冬灌试验实例，向附近群众宣传了早冬灌的好处。根据这些乡的试验结果，早冬灌比晚冬灌的麦苗分蘖多，根多根深，生长健壮。每亩产量平均高出16％—20％。这些宣传引起了周围群众的注意，现已着重准备提早冬灌。但也有些人以为今年的雨水多，用不着冬灌了，经有关部门发现后，曾及时进行了批评和纠正，并从客观条件方面分析了今年冬灌的必要性。根据历年来的试验观测：小麦全生长期的耗水量共为二百七十立方公尺，冬季耗水量占24％，折合天然降雨量一百零五公厘。目前，各地的降水量虽已接近这个标准，但如果减去径流、蒸发和土粒渗透外，能供给麦苗吸收的恐怕还不到一半。同时，上述定额是过去浅耕时的耗水量，也不包括为明春储备的水分。如果以今年的深耕密植等条件看来，现有的降雨量仍是不够的，必须以冬灌补充其不足部分。
    根据历年冬灌后容易发生地面板结裂缝现象，今年各地农民准备在冬灌后，立即进行冬锄冬耙耱，松土保墒防寒保苗。
    由于今年各地麦苗密度大，播幅宽，宝鸡、武功等县群众，还创造了一种适宜于园田化使用的小锄，锄地质量很好，受到附近群众的欢迎。此外，乾县、朝邑等县在进行查苗补苗和冬锄时，结合防治病虫害，使麦苗在幼苗期间株株健壮、安全过冬。
