Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 9th: Guangdong Province, having already surpassed its annual pig iron production target, has decided to concentrate on consolidating and improving its small blast furnaces over the next two months, aiming to produce entirely high-quality iron.

From now on, Guangdong will eliminate the earth-made furnaces and lime kilns that produce poor-quality iron, relying entirely on blast furnace production. To consolidate and improve the output and quality of small blast furnaces, various regions are classifying and ranking existing furnaces, designating production bases to retain those with good output or those that can be restored to normal operation, concentrating them in suitable areas. All blast furnaces will be equipped with blowers and hot air pipes to increase furnace temperature and produce good iron. To ensure iron quality, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has also decided to re-smelt previously produced sintered iron in blast furnaces to produce better iron. Furthermore, the province is accelerating the manufacture and installation of larger blast furnaces, including eighty-six 28-cubic-meter blast furnaces and hundreds of blast furnaces of 3 cubic meters or more. These furnaces are expected to be operational within the year, producing a batch of high-quality pig iron.

The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC has consistently emphasized quality in steel production. The quality of pig iron in various parts of the province is generally good, with an iron content of over 95%.

This newspaper, Changsha, November 9th: Hunan Province is currently engaged in a mass technological innovation movement in steel production. Centered on improving and enhancing earth-method blast furnace ironmaking technology, this movement focuses on resolving key issues such as blowing, furnace design, and the use of anthracite coal for iron smelting, and has already achieved significant results. As of October 24th, out of the 16,000 earth-made blast furnaces in normal operation across the province, over 3,000 have been equipped with various types of blowers, replacing human-powered bellows. Over 5,000 earth-made blast furnaces are using anthracite coal exclusively for iron smelting. The more than 20,000 earth-made blast furnaces recently built in various regions are all using good furnace designs that are large in capacity, fuel-efficient, and produce more iron.

After more than two months of arduous struggle by the entire Party and all the people in Hunan Province, various regions have accumulated considerable experience in earth-method steelmaking and ironmaking. The province's daily pig iron output has now been consolidated at the level of 10,000 tons. Therefore, the broad masses are urgently demanding an increase in both the quantity and quality of steel production. To further develop steel production, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPC called upon the entire Party and all the people at the end of September to launch a mass technological innovation movement based on earth-method steelmaking and ironmaking, focusing on resolving key issues such as furnace design and blowing.

Earth-made blast furnaces that have undergone preliminary technological upgrades have saved a large amount of labor and seen a significant increase in output. In You County, 303 earth-made blast furnaces use water-powered blowing, saving the county over 3,000 people needed to pull bellows and over 100 tons of coal every day. The experimental furnace of Luo Qingmin, the county magistrate of Shuangfeng County, underwent a series of technological reforms, and its daily output soared from 400 jin to 15,000 jin.

Currently, handicraft cooperatives and small farm tool factories in various regions are rushing to manufacture various blowers for earth-made blast furnaces. You County, Xinhua, and other counties have basically achieved blower-ization of earth-made blast furnace ironmaking. Now, in addition to the six million steelworkers who are making daily innovations, the broad masses of people's communes are also constantly contributing labor and materials, resolving the shortage of raw materials in technological reforms.

During the technological innovation movement, some cadres and masses also harbored erroneous ideas of waiting for "foreign" equipment and being content with the status quo. However, these ideas were quickly reversed in the torrent of mass movements and in the face of the tremendous effects of technological reforms in various regions. All localities are striving to achieve blower-ization of earth-made blast furnace ironmaking by the end of October, equipping every earth-made furnace with a blower and transforming earth-made furnaces into "earth-foreign combined furnaces" with high output and labor-saving features.

This newspaper, Guiyang, November 9th: The Zunyi Prefectural Committee of the CPC recently organized representatives from all counties in the prefecture to hold an on-site meeting in Xishui County to study and resolve the issue of improving pig iron quality.

Since July of this year, Xishui County has fully mobilized the masses and established more than 25,800 earth-method ironmaking furnaces, including earth-made blast furnaces, household furnaces, Ba-bi furnaces, cast pot furnaces, and three-section furnaces. These ironmaking furnaces have played a certain role in the ironmaking movement. However, the quality of pig iron in this county is not high; there is less gray cast iron produced by earth-made blast furnaces, and quite a bit of sintered iron. Through on-site visits and discussions, the representatives found that the main reason for the poor quality of pig iron was the low temperature inside the furnaces. According to the evaluation of twenty-two furnace types in the Xishui area, earth-made blast furnaces, small earth-made blast furnaces, large open-hearth furnaces, and Ba-bi furnaces are considered better. Quality can be guaranteed with only minor modifications. The Guandu Iron Plant replaced the earth walls of the earth-made blast furnace with stone core walls, reducing heat loss and ensuring that the quality of pig iron met standards and output remained normal. The direction of reform for small earth-made blast furnaces is to make them larger and taller, and to thicken the furnace walls, gradually increasing output while ensuring quality. The characteristics of large open-hearth furnaces and Ba-bi furnaces are that they can operate without blowing equipment and without human management during smelting. The hearths should be deepened, preferably into the shape of kerosene lamp shades, to increase the furnace temperature and reduce the production of sintered iron. In addition, workers should be fixed, and certain operating procedures and shift handover systems should be established. According to the experience of the Dianzu Camp women's furnace in the Red Flag People's Commune in implementing the "layered charging" and "small, frequent meals" operating methods, this has a significant effect on improving the quality of pig iron. The pig iron they now produce generally reaches an iron content of over 90%.

The meeting concluded that as long as the masses are relied upon, the quality of pig iron can also be resolved. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and launch a technological innovation movement centered on improving the quality of pig iron, with the Party committee taking the lead, conducting pilot projects, identifying experiences, and promoting them comprehensively. Throughout the movement, it is necessary to carry out competitions between counties, districts, furnaces, and people, and conduct regular evaluations to rapidly improve the quality of pig iron.

    重量又重质　提高再提高
    广东湖南贵州猛攻质量关决心炼好铁
    据新华社广州9日电　广东省在已经超额完成今年全年生铁任务的基础上，决定在今后两个月内，全力巩固提高小高炉，全部生产优质铁。
    从现在起，广东各地已经开始把出铁质量差的土坯炉、石灰窑等淘汰，全部依靠高炉生产。为了巩固和提高小高炉的产量质量，各地正在对现有的小高炉进行分类排队和选择确定基地，以便把出铁好或经过医治可以正常出铁的高炉留下，并且集中在条件适当的地区进行生产。全部高炉都将安上鼓风机和热风管，以提高炉温，出好铁。为了保证铁的质量，中共广东省委还决定把前一阶段生产出来的烧结铁拿到高炉再炼成好铁。此外，全省还在加紧制造和安装一批较大的高炉，有八十六个二十八立方公尺的高炉和三立方公尺以上的高炉几百个。这些高炉都将在年内投入生产，可以生产出一批质量良好的生铁。
    中共广东省委一直重视钢铁生产中的质量问题。省内各地生铁的质量一般都比较好，含铁量在95％以上。本报长沙9日电　湖南省正在开展一个群众性的钢铁生产技术革新运动。这个运动以改进和提高土高炉炼铁技术为中心，着重解决鼓风、炉型、白煤炼铁等关键性问题，并已收到显著的成绩。据10月24日统计，全省正常生产的一万六千座土高炉，已有三千多座装备了各种型号的鼓风机，代替人拉风箱。有五千多座土高炉，全部用白煤炼铁。各地最近新建的两万多座土高炉，都是采用当地容量大、燃料省、出铁多的好炉型。
    湖南省经过全党全民苦战两个多月，各地对土法炼钢、炼铁，已积累了很多经验，全省生铁日产量现已巩固在一万吨的水平上。因此，广大群众已迫切要求提高钢铁的产量和质量。中共湖南省委为了进一步发展钢铁生产，在9月底就号召全党全民，在土法炼钢铁的基础上，开展一个群众性的技术革新运动，着重解决炉型、鼓风等关键问题。
    凡是进行初步技术改革的土高炉，就节省了大批劳动力，产量也飞跃提高。攸县有三百零三座土高炉利用水力鼓风，全县每天就节省三千多个拉风箱的人力和一百多吨煤。双峰县县长罗庆民的试验炉，经过一系列的技术改革，日产量就由四百斤猛升到一万五千斤。
    目前，各地手工业社、小型农具厂都为土高炉赶制各种鼓风机，攸县、新化等县已基本实现土炉炼铁鼓风机化。现在全省除了六百万钢铁大军天天有创造发明外，人民公社的广大群众，也不断献工献料，解决技术改革中原材料不足的困难。
    在技术革新运动中，也有部分干部和群众存在着等待“洋”设备和安于现状的错误思想，但是在群众运动的洪流中和各地技术改革收到巨大效果的事实面前，很快就扭转过来。各地都力争在10月底实现土炉炼铁鼓风机化，使座座土炉都装上鼓风机，把土炉改成产量高、省劳力的“土洋结合炉”。
    本报贵阳9日电　中共遵义地委最近组织全专区各县代表，在鰼水县举行现场会议，研究解决提高生铁质量问题。
    鰼水县从今年7月以来，由于充分发动群众，共建立起包括土高炉、家庭炉、巴壁炉、铸锅炉和三节炉等土炼铁炉二万五千八百多个，这些炼铁炉在炼铁运动中，都发挥了一定的作用。但是，这个县的生铁质量不高，土高炉炼出的灰口铁较少，烧结铁相当多。代表们通过现场参观和讨论，找到了生铁质量不高的原因主要是炉内温度不高所造成。根据鰼水地区二十二种炉型的评比，认为土高炉、小土高炉、大平炉和巴壁炉等较好，只要局部加以修改，质量就有保证。官渡铁厂把土高炉的土墙改为石心墙，炉内温度散发得少，不仅使生铁质量达到标准，而且产量也很正常。小土高炉改革的方向是加大加高，并且把炉墙加厚，在保证质量的前提下，逐步提高产量。大平炉和巴壁炉的特点是可以不用鼓风设备和冶炼时不用人管理，应把炉缸加深，最好挖成煤油灯罩形，以提高炉内温度，减少出烧结铁。此外，要把工人固定起来，并建立一定的操作规程和交接班制度。根据红旗人民公社典足营妇女炉贯彻“分层布料”和少吃多餐操作方法证明，对提高生铁质量有很大作用。现在她们生产的生铁一般达到含铁90％以上。
    会议认为，只要依靠群众，生铁的质量也能得到解决。因此，必须发动群众，掀起一个以提高生铁质量为中心的技术革新运动，党委挂帅，进行试点，找出经验，全面推广。在整个运动中，要开展县与县、区与区、炉与炉、人与人之间的竞赛，定期进行评比，从而把生铁质量迅速提高。
