Editor's Note:

    Guaranteeing Commune Members Have Warm Kang Beds
    During the fertilizer accumulation campaigns of the wheat and autumn harvests, farmers in many northern regions, following custom, dismantled some of their heated kang beds and used the kang soil as top dressing. This played a significant role in increasing grain and cotton production this year.

    Now that winter has arrived, there is a need for warm kang beds to sleep on. People's communes in the suburbs of Beijing promptly organized commune members to build kang beds and also solved the problem of winter fuel, which was welcomed by the masses. Now that the crops in various regions have been basically harvested, any communes or teams that have not yet resolved this problem must seize the time, organize manpower, help commune members build kang beds, and distribute firewood and sorghum stalks to commune members by household or by kang bed, to ensure that commune members have warm kang beds to sleep on.

    保证社员有热炕睡
    在麦秋两季的积肥运动中，北方许多地区的农民按照习惯，把部分火炕拆掉，炕土作了追肥。这对今年粮棉增产起了很大作用。
    时已入冬，需要睡暖炕了。北京郊区的人民公社及时组织社员搭炕，并且一同解决了过冬的燃料问题，这是群众所欢迎的。现在，各地庄稼基本上收完了，凡是尚未解决这个问题的社、队，必须抓紧时间，组织力量，帮助社员搭炕，并按户或按炕把柴禾秫秸分给社员，保证社员睡上热炕。
