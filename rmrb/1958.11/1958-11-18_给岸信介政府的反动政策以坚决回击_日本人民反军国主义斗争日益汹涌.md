Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, Tokyo Dispatch: The 11th Extraordinary National Congress of the All Japan Express Workers' Union (Zennittsu) passed a resolution on the 16th opposing the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

This congress, held in Kinosaki County, Hyogo Prefecture, also decided that after the conclusion of the congress, it would demand that Nippon Express Co., Ltd. issue year-end bonuses equivalent to two months' salary to transportation workers. Starting from November 28th, workers will take various actions, including a nationwide strike, to carry out the year-end struggle.

The meeting also decided to demand wage increases.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, Tokyo Dispatch: According to the plan of the General Federation of Private Railway Workers' Unions of Japan, private railway workers will hold a one-hour strike starting from the departure of the first train on November 26th, in the nationwide joint struggle against the "Amendment to the Police Duties Execution Law."

This plan has been discussed by the Central Committee meeting of the Federation held today.

The meeting also discussed a plan to launch a struggle for wage increases in the spring of next year. The plan stipulates that in this struggle, the major private railway companies will be required to increase the wages of workers by an average of 2,000 yen per person. The struggle will reach its climax in late February next year, at which time a full-scale strike will be implemented.

Xinhua News Agency, November 16th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation held a Central Executive Committee meeting in Tokyo on the 15th and decided to participate in the fifth nationwide joint struggle to crush the Kishi Nobusuke government's "Amendment to the Police Duties Execution Law" scheduled for November 26th with a half-day strike.

The headquarters of the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation estimates that a total of 70,000 members from 31 member unions will participate in this joint struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, Tokyo Dispatch: Seventeen unions affiliated with the Japan National Pulp Industry Workers' Union Federation held a one-hour strike this afternoon respectively to support the struggle of the workers of the Oji Paper Manufacturing Co. Union. This sympathy strike was originally scheduled to be held on the 14th.

More than 3,100 workers at the Tomakomai Factory of Oji Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd. in Tomakomai City, Hokkaido, have been on strike since April to demand wage increases and improved working conditions. However, the company not only refused to meet the workers' demands, but also relied on the Kishi Nobusuke government's police to suppress them and used conspiracies to split the company's union, attempting to undermine the workers' strike struggle. The National Pulp Industry Workers' Union Federation held a sympathy strike for this reason on October 21st.

Xinhua News Agency, November 16th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan Teachers' Union held an extraordinary meeting of the Central Committee in Tokyo on the 15th, and adopted the current struggle policy of demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet, crushing the "Amendment to the Police Duties Execution Law," and opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's implementation of the "Performance Rating" system.

The meeting decided to participate in the joint struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" scheduled to be held by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) on November 26th. On this day, all members of the Japan Teachers' Union will collectively take leave and hold protest rallies.

In his speech at the meeting, Takeshi Kobayashi, Chairman of the Japan Teachers' Union, pointed out that due to the struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and opposition to the implementation of the "Performance Rating" system, the development of the situation is favorable to the union. He said that the two joint struggles on October 28th and November 5th achieved great results. He called on everyone to further strengthen unity on this basis and promote the struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's implementation of the "Performance Rating" system.

Miyanohara, Secretary-General of the Japan Teachers' Union, reported on the development of the struggle over the past year.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, Tokyo Dispatch: Osawa, Deputy Director of the Public Relations Department of the Japan Teachers' Union, said in Tokyo today that the Japan Teachers' Union will hold a nationwide joint struggle to protest the Kishi Nobusuke government's illegal suppression of the Wakayama Prefectural Teachers' Union.

The Wakayama Prefectural Board of Education announced today that it would dismiss, suspend, and severely warn 43 leading cadres of the Wakayama Prefectural Teachers' Union and the High School Teachers' Union because they had conducted a struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's "Performance Rating" system during the period from June 5th to September 15th this year.

The Board of Education also decided that about 2,970 teachers who participated in the struggle against the "Performance Rating" system will also be given a written "warning" by the local boards of education in the near future.

The Wakayama Prefectural Teachers' Union is preparing to wage a resolute struggle against this retaliatory punishment by the Kishi Nobusuke government authorities, demanding the revocation of these punishments. If the authorities insist on implementing these punishments, all teachers in Wakayama Prefecture will launch a leave-taking struggle.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression of Japanese teachers continues unabated. The Tokyo District Court today conducted the first trial of Hasegawa Shozo, chairman of the Tokyo Metropolitan Teachers' Union, as well as Komatsu Toshinori, head of the Shinagawa branch of this union, Takahashi Fumio, head of the Nerima branch, and Takefuji Kyoichi, head of the Kita branch, and four others because they conducted a struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's "Performance Rating" system in April this year.

    这个在兵库县城崎郡举行的大会还决定，在大会结束以后，就要求日本通运公司发给运输工人相当于两个月工资的年终津贴。从11月28日起，工人将采取包括全国性罢工的各种方式进行年终斗争。

    这个方案已经由今天举行的联合会的中央委员会会议讨论过。
    会议还讨论了在明年春季开展要求增加工资的斗争的方案。方案规定，在这个斗争中，将要求各大私营铁道公司对工人的工资平均每人增加两千日元。斗争将以明年2月下旬为最高潮，在那个时候将实行全面罢工。

    在北海道苫小牧市的王子制纸工业公司苫小牧工场的三千一百多名工人，为了要求资方增加工资和改善劳动条件，从4月间以来一直在进行罢工，但是公司方面不但拒绝满足工人方面的要求，反而仗恃岸信介政府的警察进行镇压，并且使用阴谋分裂这个公司的工会，企图破坏工人的罢工斗争。全国纸浆产业工会联合会曾经为此在10月21日举行过一次同情罢工。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本教职员工会15日在东京举行的中央委员会临时会议，通过了要求立即解散国会、粉碎“警察官职务执行法修正案”、反对岸信介政府实行“勤务评定”制度的当前斗争方针。

    日本教职员工会委员长小林武在会上致辞时指出，由于进行了反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”和反对实行“勤务评定”制度等斗争，形势的发展对工会方面有利。他说，10月28日和11月5日的两次联合斗争取得了很大成绩。他要求大家在这个基础上进一步加强团结，推进反对岸信介政府实行“勤务评定”制度的斗争。

    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本教职员工会宣传部副部长大泽今天在东京发表谈话说，日本教职员工会将举行全国性的联合斗争，来抗议岸信介政府对和歌山县教职员工会的非法镇压。
    和歌山县教育委员会今天宣布，对和歌山县教职员工会和高中教职员工会的四十三名领导干部给予免职、定期停职和严重警告的处分，因为他们曾经在今年6月5日到9月15日这段期间进行了反对岸信介政府的“勤务评定”制度的斗争。
    这个教育委员会还决定，参加过反对“勤务评定”制度斗争的约二千九百七十名教职员，也要由各地方教育委员会在最近给以书面“警告”的处分。
    和歌山县教职员工会已经在准备对岸信介政府当局这种报复性的处分进行坚决斗争，要求撤销这些处分，如果当局硬要实行这些处分，和歌山县全体教职员就要展开请假斗争。
    岸信介政府对日本教职员的镇压仍然层出不穷。东京地方裁判所今天对东京都教职员工会委员长长谷川正三以及这个工会的品川支部长小松俊矩、练马支部长高桥文夫和北支部长竹藤强一等七人进行了第一次审讯，因为他们在今年4月进行了反对岸信介政府的“勤务评定”制度的斗争。
