Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 9th: According to TASS, yesterday the Executive Committee of the 10th General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), disregarding repeated demands from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and some other nations to restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China and revoke the credentials of the Chiang Kai-shek elements who are illegally occupying China's seat, under pressure from the United States representative, passed a decision by a vote of 39 to 21 (with 7 abstentions) to continue allowing the Chiang Kai-shek elements to participate in the conference and to have the right to vote. In protest against this illegal decision, representatives from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries unanimously walked out of the meeting hall when the Chiang Kai-shek elements spoke.

At the General Conference on the 6th, UNESCO unanimously approved the acceptance of Kuwait, the West Indies Federation, and Italian-administered Somaliland as members of the organization.

The conference also discussed the Executive Committee's recommendation regarding allowing non-governmental international organizations to send observers to the conference. The Czechoslovakian representative proposed allowing the International Union of Students to send observers. Representatives from Hungary and Bulgaria criticized the recommendation for not including organizations such as the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the International Organization of Journalists, and the International Broadcasting Organization in the organization's activities. Subsequently, the conference suggested that the Executive Committee study the suggestions made by the General Conference regarding inviting many non-governmental international organizations to send observers.

    联合国科教组织继续让蒋介石分子窃据我席位
    苏联等国代表一致退出会场表示抗议
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：昨天联合国教育、科学及文化组织第十届大会执行委员会不顾苏联等社会主义国家和其它一些国家的代表一再要求恢复中国的合法代表权和取消非法窃据中国席位的蒋介石分子的资格，在美国代表的压力下，以三十九票对二十一票（七票弃权）通过决定，继续让蒋介石分子参加大会，并有表决权。为了抗议这种非法决定，苏联和其它社会主义国家的代表在蒋介石分子发言的时候一致退出了会场。
    教育、科学及文化组织在6日的大会全体会议上一致通过接受科威特、西印度群岛联邦和意大利托管的索马利兰为这个组织的成员。
    大会还讨论了执行委员会所提出的关于允许非政府国际组织派观察员列席大会的建议书。捷克斯洛伐克代表提出允许国际学生联合会派观察员的建议。匈牙利和保加利亚的代表对建议书没有提出吸收世界民主青年联盟、国际新闻工作者协会、国际广播组织这样一些团体参加这个组织的活动，提出了指责。随后大会建议执行委员会研究大会全体会议所提出的关于邀请许多非政府国际组织派遣观察员的建议。
