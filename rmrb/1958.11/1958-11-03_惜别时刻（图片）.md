Farewell Moment
Quick sketch by Hong Lu

Good kids, don't be sad, Uncle will write to you as soon as I get home!
Dance one more time, etched deep in my heart.
Leave your contact information, friends forever.
Thank you, kind doctor, for saving the lives of mother and three children.
Seeing you off, again and again, a thousand miles cannot express the depth of feeling.
Shoulder to shoulder comrades-in-arms, no need for farewells, united in iron will to safeguard peace.
Amani, good mother, will never forget you, dear elder!

    惜别时刻
    洪炉速写好孩子，莫伤心，叔叔回家就给你写信！再跳一次舞，记在心深处。留下通讯处，永远做朋友。谢谢这位好医生，救了母子三人命。送一程，又一程，再送千里难尽心。并肩战友不言别，共保和平心似铁。阿妈妮，好妈妈，永远不忘你老人家！
