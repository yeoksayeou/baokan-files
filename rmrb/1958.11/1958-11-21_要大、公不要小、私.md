To be "big" and "public" is the basic characteristic of the people's commune. Therefore, to consolidate and develop the superiority of the people's commune, we must promote communist ideology starting from "big and public" and criticize capitalist ideology starting from "small and private." In the people's commune movement, the struggle between these two ideologies reflects the struggle between two roads in the ideological field.

Comrade Hu Changbi, deputy director of the Xuguang People's Commune in Echeng County, Hubei Province, and former secretary of the Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative Party branch and director of the cooperative, used to be active in his work, energetic, and unafraid of hardship, and was considered a "red flag cadre." However, in August and September of this year, just as the broad masses of members of the Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative were enthusiastically demanding to join the people's commune, he took on a heavy ideological burden. The Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative was originally a well-run and relatively wealthy agricultural cooperative in Echeng County, but because Comrade Hu Changbi lacked communist awareness starting from "big and public," this "prominence" and "relative wealth" made him lose his way forward. At first, although he also expressed support for the establishment of the people's commune, he only wanted the 378 households of the Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative to "cross the single-plank bridge" and "upgrade directly," unwilling to merge with other "poor cooperatives," or only willing to merge with cooperatives with the same conditions. Later, he saw that merging cooperatives was the general trend and unstoppable, so he proposed the so-called "three principles" of merging cooperatives at the members' representative meeting: the "ownership" of large agricultural implements and machines could be handed over to the commune, but the original small cooperatives should retain the "right to use"; labor could be unified and allocated, but "the needs of each small cooperative should be met in advance"; distribution should be unified, but it should be distributed "according to the proportion of the original small cooperative's income and this year's income and expenditure."

The so-called "crossing the single-plank bridge" and "direct upgrading" theory is a reflection of capitalist individual farming ideology under new conditions. The so-called "three principles" are the ideas of "the strong not carrying the weak," "the advanced not carrying the backward," and "the rich cooperative not carrying the poor cooperative," which are the ideas of wealthy middle peasants "preferring the rich and disliking the poor," and also a reflection of capitalist spontaneous tendencies under new conditions.

Comrade Hu Changbi's concerns about merging cooperatives and transitioning to communes were said to be because he was afraid that "once leveled," the production of his original small unit would not be done well, and income would be reduced, that is, he was afraid that his original small unit would no longer be as prominent as before. This is the so-called fear that the "red flag will fall." This kind of thinking, if viewed from the perspective of ideological consciousness, reflects the capitalist thinking of wealthy middle peasants, and from the perspective of methodology, it is only satisfied with the existing achievements of "small and private," and does not see the superiority of "big and public"; it only looks backward, not forward; it also shows a metaphysical viewpoint that does not look at problems from the perspective of development. It should also be explained here that people must strive to maintain the advanced title they have already obtained with the spirit of striving for the upper reaches, which is in line with the socialist competition principle. But the problem is: is it maintained with a communist style, or with a departmentalism and individualism style. The red flag we want to strive for can only first mean the command of communist ideology, and must not be commanded by departmentalism and individualism ideology. If we try to "protect the red flag" with departmentalism and individualism ideology, we will inevitably lose our way and go to the opposite side of the red flag. Under the socialist system, there can only be socialist competition of mutual assistance and cooperation, and absolutely no capitalist competition that harms others to benefit oneself or harms the public to benefit the private.

If a person or a unit is complacent because of outstanding work, arrogant because of achievements, "dislikes the poor" because of "wealth," and excludes the backward because of being advanced; then the advanced will inevitably be transformed into backwardness, and "good things" will become "bad things." Therefore, we should learn a lesson from this: to keep the red flag, we must continue to move forward in the direction of "big and public"; we must constantly promote communism and eliminate capitalism, and constantly overcome the departmentalism and individualism thinking of "small and private." Therefore, when a unit has obtained an advanced title, it is even more necessary to selflessly help backward units catch up with the advanced.

Because the people's commune movement raised the issue of building socialism and preparing conditions for a gradual transition to communism, it also raised the issue of ideologically passing the communist "test" for people. In the past, some people may have passed the war "test," the land reform "test," and the socialist "test" relatively smoothly, but if they do not work hard to improve their communist awareness and constantly promote the communist style, they may not be able to smoothly pass the communist "test." As mentioned earlier, being both big and public are the basic characteristics of the people's commune, and also the basic direction for building socialism and gradually moving towards communism. To achieve "big and public," we must be "selfless" and make a complete break with all selfish ideas left over from the old society. If people's minds are not clean of these decadent things, they may become a stumbling block to people's progress under certain conditions. Comrade Hu Changbi was dragged down by the departmentalism and individualism thinking of "small and private," which held back his continuous progress. For communism, it is not only necessary to "most resolutely break with all ownership relations passed down from the past"; but also to "most resolutely break with all concepts passed down from the past" ("Communist Manifesto"). But these are realized through the process of "continuous revolution," and also through the struggle of opposing sides between the new and the old. This requires people not to lose their way to communism at any time.

In the process of merging large cooperatives and transitioning to communes, the vast majority of people handle problems in accordance with the communist spirit, adhering to both big and public, and also appropriately taking care of the original wealthy cooperatives. However, there are also a few people who are concerned about the calculations of "poor cooperatives" and "rich cooperatives," and concerned about the calculations of "suffering losses" and "taking advantage." As a result, in some people's communes, the unified allocation and arrangement of large agricultural implements, machinery and equipment, financial management, and labor has been obstructed by certain departmentalism, decentralism, and individualism. In order to further consolidate the people's commune and give play to the superiority of the people's commune, it is necessary to greatly break down departmentalism, individualism, and all kinds of bourgeois ideology, and greatly promote the communist ideology of being selfless and public-minded.

After being helped and criticized by the party organization and the masses, Comrade Hu Changbi quickly changed, made a profound self-criticism at the conference, improved himself and educated the masses. We welcome this change, which is a victory for communist ideology. To this end, the Huanggang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to carry out a discussion on the ideological transformation of Hu Changbi in the entire region, and also required that while discussing the ideology of Hu Changbi, they should learn from the bold creation, disregard for personal gains and losses, and communist style of actively fighting against capitalist ideology of Comrade Xiao Gongzi, deputy director of the Xuguang People's Commune. This opposite is well grasped, and carrying out such a discussion and learning is of great significance; with the gradual deepening of the discussion and learning, the red flag of communist thought will inevitably be raised higher and higher.

    要大、公不要小、私
    吴传启
    “一曰大，二曰公”，是人民公社的基本特点。因此要巩固和发展人民公社的优越性，必须发扬从“大公”出发的共产主义思想，批判从“小私”出发的资本主义思想。在人民公社化运动中，这两种思想的斗争，反映了思想领域内的两条道路的斗争。
    湖北鄂城县旭光人民公社副社长、原旭光一社党支部书记兼社主任胡昌璧同志，过去一贯工作积极，有干劲，不怕吃苦，被认为是“红旗干部”。可是在今年8、9月间，正当旭光一社广大社员热烈要求加入人民公社的时候，他却背上了严重的思想包袱。旭光一社原来是鄂城县办得较好、也是比较富裕的农业社，但由于胡昌璧同志缺乏从“大公”出发的共产主义觉悟，这种“突出”和“较富裕”却使他迷失了前进的方向。开始他虽然也表示拥护建立人民公社，却只想就三百七十八户的旭光一社“过独木桥”，“直接升级”，不愿同其它“穷社”合并，或者是只同条件相同的社合并。后来他看到并社是大势所趋，不可阻挡，于是又在社员代表大会上提出了并社的所谓“三原则”：大型农具和机器的“所有权”可以交给公社，但原小社应保留“使用权”；劳力可以统一调配，但“事先要满足各小社的需要”；分配应该统一，但“要根据原来小社收入的多少、今年收支多少的比例”来分配。
    这里所说的“过独木桥”和“直接升级”论，是资本主义的单干思想在新条件下的反映。所谓“三原则”，就是“强不带弱”、“先进不带落后”、“富社不带穷社”的思想，就是富裕中农“嫌贫爱富”的思想，也就是资本主义自发倾向在新条件下的反映。
    胡昌璧同志对于并社和转公社的顾虑，据说还因为怕“一拉平”后，使自己原来的小单位的生产搞不好了，收入减少了，即怕自己原来的小单位不再像以前那样突出了。也就是所谓怕“红旗倒了”。这种思想，如果从思想意识上来看，就是反映了富裕中农的资本主义思想，而从思想方法上来看，乃是只满足于“小私”的已有成就，看不到“大公”的优越性；只向后看，不向前看；也就是表现了不从发展上看问题的形而上学观点。这里还应当说明，人们必须以力争上游的精神，保住已经得到的先进称号，这是符合于社会主义竞赛原则的。但问题在于：是用共产主义的风格来保，还是用本位主义和个人主义的作风来保。我们要争取的红旗，只能首先意味着共产主义思想的挂帅，决不能由本位主义和个人主义思想挂帅。如果企图用本位主义和个人主义的思想作风来“保红旗”的话，就必然迷失方向，走到红旗的反面。在社会主义制度下，只能是互助合作的社会主义竞赛，决不允许损人利己或损公利私的资本主义竞争。
    假使一个人或者一个单位，因工作突出而自满，因成绩而自傲，因“富裕”而“嫌贫”，因先进而排斥落后；则先进就必然会转化为落后，“好事”就要变为“坏事”。因此我们应从这里得到教训：要保住红旗，必须沿着“一大二公”的方向不断前进；必须不断兴无灭资，不断克服“一小二私”的本位主义和个人主义思想。因此当一个单位取得了先进的称号以后，就更加要无私地帮助落后单位赶上先进。
    由于人民公社化运动提出了建成社会主义并为逐步向共产主义过渡准备条件的问题，从而也就向人们提出了在思想上过共产主义“关”的问题。在过去，有的人即使比较顺利地过了战争“关”、土改“关”和社会主义“关”，但是，如果不努力提高共产主义觉悟和不断发扬共产主义风格，则不一定能够顺利地过好共产主义“关”。前面提到，既大且公，是人民公社的基本特点，又是建设社会主义逐步走向共产主义的基本方向。要做到“大公”，就必须“无私”，必须同旧社会遗留下来的各种自私观念实行彻底决裂。如果人们脑子里对这些腐朽的东西抛弃得不干净，它就可能在一定的条件下成为人们前进的绊脚石。胡昌璧同志就是被“一小二私”的本位主义和个人主义思想，拖住了他不断前进的后腿。对于共产主义来说，不仅“要最坚决地打破过去传下来的所有制关系”；而且“要最坚决地打破过去传下来的各种观念”（“共产党宣言”）。但这些是通过“不断革命”的过程实现的，也是通过新旧之间对立面的斗争来实现的。这就要求人们在任何时候，都不能迷失走向共产主义的方向。
    在并大社和转公社的过程中，绝大多数人都是按照共产主义精神来处理问题的，既坚持大公，也适当照顾原来的富社。但是也有少数人斤斤于“穷社”和“富社”的计较，斤斤于“吃亏”和“沾光”的计较。以至于有的人民公社，在大型农具、机器设备、财务管理和劳力的统一调配和安排上，遭到了某些本位主义、分散主义和个人主义的阻挡。为了进一步巩固人民公社，发挥人民公社的优越性，就必须大破本位主义、个人主义和各种各样的资产阶级思想，大立大公无私的共产主义思想。
    胡昌璧同志经过党组织和群众的帮助和批判后，迅速转变过来了，在大会上作了深刻的自我批判，提高了自己也教育了群众，我们欢迎这种转变，这是共产主义思想的胜利。为此中共黄冈地委决定在全区开展胡昌璧思想转变的讨论，并要求在讨论胡昌璧思想的同时，学习旭光人民公社副社长萧功梓同志的大胆创造、不计较个人得失和积极向资本主义思想作斗争的共产主义风格。这个对立面抓得很好，开展这样一个讨论和学习是具有重大意义的；随着讨论和学习的逐步深入，必然会把共产主义的思想红旗越举越高。
