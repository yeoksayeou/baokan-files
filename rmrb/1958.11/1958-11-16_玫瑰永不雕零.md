    The Rose That Never Withers
    Children are familiar with Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale "The Snow Queen." The play adapted by Soviet playwright Yevgeny Schwartz makes this fairy tale even richer and more interesting. The performance by the China Children's Art Theatre gives the play a new, vivid, and artistically vibrant life with Chinese characteristics on stage.
    Children can receive moral education here, learning from Little Gerda's sincerity and courage. To save her little companion Kay, she fears no danger, overcomes all kinds of hardships, and finally defeats the Snow Queen.
    There is a bright red rose in the play that does not wither even in the severe cold. It symbolizes sincerity, friendship, and courage, symbolizing the happiness of kind and upright people. The villains try to exchange it for money, but they fail; they try to destroy it with violence, but they also fail. The bright red rose is the heart of the suffering people; it never withers.
    Children and parents, go and see "The Snow Queen"!

    玫瑰永不雕零
    孩子们都熟悉安徒生的童话“雪女王”，由苏联剧作家施瓦尔茨改编的剧本使得这童话更加丰富有趣，中国儿童剧院的演出，又使得剧本在舞台得到新的有声有色、富有中国风味的艺术生命。
    孩子们能从这里得到品德方面的教育，要学习小盖尔达那样真诚和勇敢，为了救出自己的小同伴凯依，她不怕艰险，历尽千辛万苦，终于战胜了雪女王。
    戏里有一朵鲜艳的红玫瑰，它在严寒也不雕谢，它象征着真诚、友爱和勇敢，象征着善良正直的人们的幸福。坏蛋们想用金钱换走它，他们失败了；想用暴力摧残它，他们也失败了。鲜红的玫瑰是受苦难的人们的心，它永不雕零。
    孩子们，家长们，都去看“雪女王”吧！
