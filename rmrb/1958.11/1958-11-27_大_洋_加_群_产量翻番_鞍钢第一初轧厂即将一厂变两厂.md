Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 26th. As a result of Anshan Iron and Steel's First Primary Rolling Mill's unleashing of the masses, the hourly steel production capacity since late November has rapidly increased from over 300 tons in September to over 500 tons. At this rate, its steel production next year can more than double this year's output.

After the rectification movement this year, Anshan Iron and Steel's First Primary Rolling Mill saw a leap forward in production. The hot steel ingots supplied by the steelmaking plant for rolling could not meet the demand, leading to a gradual increase in the use of cold steel ingots, which accounted for over 25% in October. The heating time for cold steel ingots is three to ten times longer than that for hot steel ingots, which meant that the soaking pit section's heating of steel ingots could not meet the needs of the rolling mill section, affecting the increase in steel production. The workers tried many methods to shorten the steel heating time, but because they were limited to small improvements in operating methods by a few people, the effect was not significant. In order to completely overcome the backward links in production, the Party organization of the First Primary Rolling Mill decided to mobilize the masses to implement rapid heating. At first, some cadres were afraid to hand over the measures to the masses, fearing that a sudden increase in heating efficiency would cause problems. However, the Party organization resolutely adopted the method of unleashing the masses, explaining the situation, tasks, significance, and measures to the masses, and mobilizing everyone to boldly conduct experiments. Whichever furnace succeeded first would have its experience promoted. As a result, on the evening of October 14th, the workers on duty at Furnace No. 3 first doubled the heating efficiency. Subsequently, all soaking pits promoted the experience of Furnace No. 3, achieving the goal of doubling heating efficiency.

The leap forward in the soaking pit section fully demonstrated the power of the mass movement. On this basis, the Party committee of the First Primary Rolling Mill put forward the revolutionary slogan of "600 ingots per shift, 10,000 tons of steel per day, transform one mill into two mills," guiding the masses to attack new weak links. Due to the increased production efficiency of the soaking pit section, the rolling mill section fell relatively behind. Its inability to promptly roll the heated steel ingots into steel became the key to whether the entire mill could increase production. However, the head of this section was bound by dogmatism, believing that the reason for poor production was the lack of strict regulations and systems. Therefore, he usually relied more on systems and orders, which greatly limited the enthusiasm of the masses. After analyzing this situation, the Party committee first mobilized the masses to launch criticism, enabling the section leaders to establish the idea of firmly believing in and relying on the masses. On this basis, a new situation quickly emerged in the rolling mill section, where leading cadres, technicians, and workers closely combined to carry out technical revolution, achieving great results. In July and August of this year, the technicians in this workshop had repeatedly studied the issue of increasing the rolling section of the primary rolling mill and transforming the continuous rolling mill to improve the steel rolling capacity, but they had not succeeded. This time, the technical reform plan was re-introduced, and the workers were mobilized to participate in the discussion, design, and construction. It only took eight days to successfully reform it, increasing the rolling capacity of the primary rolling mill by 42%.

Currently, Anshan Iron and Steel's First Primary Rolling Mill is further solving the new imbalances that have emerged on the new production basis by vigorously carrying out the mass movement.

    “大”“洋”加“群”产量翻番
    鞍钢第一初轧厂即将一厂变两厂
    新华社鞍山26日电　鞍钢第一初轧厂放手发动群众的结果，11月下旬以来每小时的钢材生产能力，已经由9月份的三百多吨很快提高到五百多吨。按照这个水平，明年它的钢材产量就可以比今年增长一倍以上。
    鞍钢第一初轧厂今年经过整风运动以后，生产上出现了跃进局面，炼钢厂供应它轧制钢材的热钢锭不能满足需要，因而调用的冷钢锭逐渐增多起来，10月份占到25％以上。冷钢锭的加热时间要比热钢锭长三倍到十倍，这就使均热工段加热的钢锭不能适应轧钢工段的需要，影响到钢材产量的提高。工人们曾想了很多办法来缩短烧钢时间，但是由于只限于部分人在操作方法上作点滴改进，因此效果不大。为了彻底克服生产落后环节，第一初轧厂党组织决定发动群众实行快速加热。开始时，有些干部不敢把措施交给群众，怕猛然提高加热效率会出乱子。但是，党组织坚决采取了放手发动群众的方法，向群众讲形势、讲任务、讲意义、讲措施，发动大家大胆进行试验，哪个炉子首先试验成功，就推广哪个炉子的经验。结果，10月14日晚上三号炉当班的职工首先把加热效率提高了一倍；随后，全部均热炉推广了三号炉的经验，都实现了加热效率翻一番的目标。
    均热工段的跃进事实，充分证明了群众运动的威力。第一初轧厂党委在这个基础上，又提出了“班产六百（轧制钢锭块数）、日产万吨（钢材）、一厂变两厂”的革命性口号，引导群众向新的薄弱环节进攻。由于均热工段生产效率提高，轧钢工段相对地落后了。它不能把加热的钢锭及时轧成钢材，成为当时全厂能否增产的关键。可是这个工段的段长受着教条主义的束缚，认为生产搞不好是因为规程制度不严，因而平时更多的是依靠制度和命令办事，大大限制了群众积极性的发挥。党委分析了这个情况，便首先发动群众展开批评，使工段领导树立了坚决相信群众、依靠群众的思想。在这一基础上，轧钢工段很快出现了领导干部、技术人员和工人紧密结合进行技术革命的新局面，获得了很大成果。今年7、8月间，这个车间的技术人员曾经数次研究加大初轧机轧制断面、改造连轧机来提高轧钢能力的问题，但是一直没有成功。这次把这项技术改革方案重新提出来，发动工人参加讨论、设计和施工，只用八天时间就改革成功了，使初轧机的轧制能力提高了42％。
    目前，鞍钢第一初轧厂正在进一步通过大搞群众运动的办法，解决在新的生产基础上出现的新的不平衡。
