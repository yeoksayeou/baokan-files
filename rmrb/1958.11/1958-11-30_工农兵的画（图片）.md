Paintings by Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

The "Exhibition of Paintings by Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers," jointly organized by the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Artists Association, has selected over seven hundred works from the creations of workers, peasants, and People's Liberation Army soldiers across the country. Using a creative method that combines realism and romanticism, the worker, peasant, and soldier masses depict the inspiring scenes of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and also reflect their great ideals and rich imagination. Here are four of them:
