    Reporter Tian Lianggeng reports: The Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory, without increasing equipment, has launched a mass technological innovation movement in which everyone participates in design and everyone becomes a process engineer. Fifty-six types of products, materials, and auxiliary materials have reached the peak of current science. The output value completed now exceeds the total during the first five-year plan.
    The factory's mass technological innovation movement was launched on the basis of the rectification movement's conclusion and the victory of the political and ideological struggle. This spring, the political enthusiasm brought about by the rectification movement was reflected in production, and a production upsurge of learning from and catching up with the advanced emerged. At that time, the factory's Party organization guided the situation and called on all factory employees to launch a vigorous mass technological innovation movement to ensure the realization of this year's leap forward plan. At the same time, it proposed the battle slogans of "process rationalization, manual mechanization, mechanical automation," "design standardization," and "thinking about innovation in everything, talking about innovation with everyone, engaging in innovation individually, producing innovation everywhere, and innovating again and again." Under this slogan, the tide of technological innovation immediately spread to every corner. Various suggestions poured in. From April to mid-November, factory employees put forward more than 330,000 technological innovation proposals, more than 290,000 of which were implemented, increasing work efficiency by one to 180,000 times. Yang Zhongyin, a young activist, created the "rapid polishing method," which increased the polishing efficiency of optical glass to only eight minutes per disc, surpassing international standards. Even the most advanced countries require thirty minutes. Ma Fuchang's grinding of small lenses the size of match heads, with a diameter of 0.886 millimeters, has increased from the initial output of five pieces per day to more than one hundred pieces.
    With the in-depth development of the mass technological innovation movement, the masses were no longer satisfied with minor improvements. Therefore, the Party committee put forward the slogans "Everyone Be a Process Engineer, Everyone Be a Designer," "One Person, Multiple Skills; One Machine, Multiple Uses; One Teacher, Multiple Apprentices," encouraging employees to move forward in the correct direction and improve. The sixth workshop was processing cuboid castings. The process regulations stipulated single-sided processing to ensure "precision." In reality, the efficiency was not high, and the precision was difficult to guarantee. Engineering and technical personnel had also racked their brains for this, turning over books, checking materials, studying geometric shapes, and even suspecting that the machine tool was not good. Old worker You Xian'guang created a method of flying-knife multi-face milling and multi-piece clamping, which not only solved the precision problem but also increased work efficiency by 200 times. The technical personnel said admiringly: "Even if you wear out the materials, you can't find this good method." In order to enable workers to participate in product and process design, the factory adopted two methods: one was to organize technical teams with workers participating to jointly design new products until they were manufactured. This method enabled the factory to trial-produce 27 new products this year that China had never made before, including many independently designed cutting-edge products such as 1,500x biological microscopes and binocular stereo microscopes. If the design department were relied on alone, the design of these products alone would take two to three years. In addition, a complete set of spare-time education and scientific research systems were established, from literacy classes and spare-time universities to research institutes, to meet the workers' requirements for cultural and technical revolution and ensure that the movement develops from simple to complex and from low to high.
    Some of the Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory's practices in mobilizing the masses can be used as a reference for "large foreign" factories, especially those with multiple varieties and processes.
    1. At the beginning of each month, the factory holds an expanded meeting of the Party committee, a workers' representative meeting, a technical personnel meeting, and a mass meeting to talk about the situation, talk about the prospects, and talk about the tasks. It constantly criticizes the idea of "reaching the top in the leap forward" and constantly puts forward new slogans to specifically assign tasks to workshops, groups, and individuals. Through great airing of views, great contending, big-character posters, and great debates, monthly, ten-day, and daily plans are formulated to clarify everyone's battle goals.
    2. Adopt the method of individuals catching up with pacesetters and workshops competing for advancement to lead the mass movement to unfold widely from points to areas. Pacesetters are established in various types and aspects such as the whole factory, workshops, groups, types of work, and apprentices. Through on-site demonstrations, visits, and exhibitions, a movement of learning from and catching up with pacesetters is launched to fully spread the advanced experience of the pacesetters.
    3. The professional technical teams organized by the factory are a new development of the three-way combination of cadres, workers, and technical personnel under the leadership of the Party. According to different product and process characteristics, technical teams are formed to address the technical barriers existing in production. Each technical team has specific tasks and deadlines to complete them. Some are responsible for designing and manufacturing new products, and some are responsible for breaking through certain technical difficulties. Under the fierce attack of the technical teams, cutting-edge products are produced at high speed.

    人人参加设计革新技术
    云南光学仪器厂不增设备生产总值翻几番
    本报昆明28日电　记者田良耕报道：云南光学仪器厂在国家不增添设备的情况下，大搞群众性的技术革新运动，人人参加设计，个个做工艺师。有五十六种产品、材料和副料攀上当前科学的高峰。现在完成的产值已比第一个五年计划期间的总和还多。
    这个厂的技术革新的群众运动是在整风运动结束、政治思想斗争取得胜利的基础上开展起来的。今年春天，由整风带来的政治热情已反映在生产上，出现了学先进赶先进的生产热潮。当时，工厂党组织因势利导，号召全厂职工展开了一个声势浩大的技术革新群众运动，保证实现今年的跃进计划。同时，提出“工艺合理化、手工机械化、机械自动化”“设计标准化”和“事事想革新、人人谈革新、个个搞革新、处处出革新、革新再革新”的战斗口号。在这个口号下，革新技术的浪潮立即波及每个角落。各种建议纷至沓来。从4月到11月中旬，全厂职工提出的技术革新建议达三十三万多件，付诸实现的有二十九万多件，分别提高工效一倍到十八万倍。青年积极分子杨锺寅创造的“快速抛光法”，把光学玻璃的抛光效率提高到每盘只需八分钟，超过了国际水平。而最先进的国家也需三十分钟。马福昌研磨火柴头大小的零点八八六公厘直径的小透镜，由最初的日产五块已提高到一百块以上。
    群众性技术革新运动深入发展，群众就不满足细小枝节上的改进。于是党委提出了“人人当工艺员、个个作设计师”“一人多艺、一机多用、一师多徒”的口号，鼓励职工往正确方向前进和提高。六车间加工长方体铸件，工艺规程上规定要单面加工，确保“精度”，实际上，效率不高，精度也难保证。工程技术人员为此也曾大伤脑筋，翻书本，查资料，研究几何形状，甚至怀疑机床不好。老工人游现光创造飞刀多面铣和多件装夹的办法，既解决了精度问题，又提高工效二百倍。技术人员钦佩地说：翻破资料也找不到这个好方法。为了使工人能参与产品和工艺设计，这个厂采取了两种办法：一是组织有工人参加的技术大队，共同着手进行对新产品的设计直到制成。这种办法使这个厂今年已试制成二十七种我国从未制过的新产品；其中，有一千五百倍生物显微镜、双目立体显微镜等许多自行设计的尖端产品。如果单单依靠设计部门，光这些产品的设计就需二、三年功夫。此外，还办起从扫盲、业余大学到研究院一整套业余教育和科学研究系统，满足工人对文化和技术革命的要求，保证运动由简到繁，由低到高地发展。
    云南光学仪器厂在发动群众中，有些作法可供“大洋”特别是多品种多工艺的工厂参考。
    一、每月初，这个厂就召开党委扩大会议，职工代表大会、技术人员会和群众大会，讲形势、讲远景、讲任务，不断批判“跃进到顶”的思想，不断提出新的口号，把任务具体分到车间、小组和个人，经过大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，制定月、旬、日计划，使大家战斗目标明确。
    二、采取个人赶标兵，车间赛先进的办法，以点带面地领导群众运动广泛展开。全厂、车间、小组、工种、学徒等各个类型、各个方面都树立标兵，通过现场表演、参观、展览，掀起学标兵赶标兵运动，把标兵的先进经验全面铺开。
    三、这个厂组织的专业技术大队，是在党的领导下干部、工人和技术人员三结合的新发展。他们按照不同的产品和工艺性质，针对生产上存在的技术堡垒，组成技术大队。每个技术大队都有具体任务，限期完成。有的负责设计到制成新产品，有的负责突破某项技术困难。在技术大队的猛攻下，以高速度制出尖端产品。（附图片）
