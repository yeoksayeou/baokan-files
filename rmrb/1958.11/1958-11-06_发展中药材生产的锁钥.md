    The Key to Developing the Production of Traditional Chinese Medicinal Materials
    Today, the State Council issued the "Instructions on the Development of Traditional Chinese Medicinal Materials Production." This instruction points out that the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials should implement local production and local supply, and actively and systematically transform wild animal and plant medicinal materials into domesticated and cultivated ones. This is the basic principle for developing the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials and solving the supply problem, and it is also the fundamental way to gradually meet the medical needs of the people.
    Traditional Chinese medicinal materials are an important material force for eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eradicating diseases. They are of great significance for enhancing the people's physique, improving labor productivity, and accelerating the country's socialist construction. Traditional Chinese medicine is an essential weapon for traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to treat diseases. Traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are an inseparable whole. For thousands of years, the broad masses of the Chinese people have relied on it to treat diseases, and it has played a huge role in the survival and development of our nation. Since the Party Central Committee issued instructions in 1954 to improve the work of traditional Chinese medicine, resolutely correcting the past mistakes of the health departments in inappropriately restricting, squeezing out, and discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine, the health departments have undergone a fundamental transformation in their approach to traditional Chinese medicine issues, and the production of traditional Chinese medicine has also seen significant improvements. Since 1955, many provinces and relevant business departments have made specific arrangements for the production of medicinal materials. Some provinces have included certain medicinal material varieties in the national economic plan, some localities have allocated land and established medicinal animal farms, medicinal plant plantations, and nurseries, and some localities have newly discovered many medicinal sources, etc. The output of traditional Chinese medicinal materials has increased greatly. In 1957, the total value of purchased traditional Chinese medicinal materials increased by 642% compared to 1953, and the supply increased by 639%. However, recently, due to the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the gradual improvement of people's lives, and the development of the patriotic health campaign, the people's demand for traditional Chinese medicinal materials has increased. In addition, some regions have not simultaneously focused on the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials while focusing on the production of major crops. As a result, the production and purchase of certain traditional Chinese medicinal materials have actually declined. This situation must be changed. Otherwise, it will directly affect the treatment of diseases, the health of the people, and the construction of the country.
    The key to developing the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials is to implement local production and local supply, and to systematically transform wild animal and plant medicinal materials into domesticated and cultivated ones. The advantage of doing so is that wild animals and plants that naturally grow and die can be produced in a planned manner, so that the output of traditional Chinese medicinal materials is built on a relatively stable and reliable foundation, so that the collection of medicinal plants and the capture of medicinal animals are not guaranteed due to natural disasters affecting wild plant medicinal materials, or the supply of medicinal materials across the country is affected by a poor harvest in one area. To achieve local production and local supply, and to transform wild animal and plant medicinal materials into domesticated and cultivated ones, it is necessary to break the superstition about "authentic medicinal materials." The idea that "authentic medicinal materials" can only be produced in a certain area and that the quality must be good has been deeply rooted in people's minds for a long time. Some traditional Chinese medicine management departments only deal in "authentic medicinal materials," some doctors prescribe only "authentic medicinal materials," and people are even more afraid to introduce "authentic medicinal materials" locally for cultivation. Facts have proven that this is wrong. Some so-called "authentic medicinal materials" can be completely introduced for cultivation. For example, people have always believed that Huaidi rehmannia root and Dongbei ginseng are the best, that rehmannia root can only be produced in a few counties in northern Henan, and that ginseng can only be produced in the Northeast. But in fact, Guanghua County, Hubei Province, introduced seventeen mu of rehmannia root in 1957, with a high yield of two thousand catties per mu, and the quality was no less than that of Huaidi rehmannia root; Xinjiang County, Shanxi Province, introduced ginseng from the Northeast in 1957, and this year has harvested twenty catties of ginseng seeds from five-year-old ginseng seedlings. Not only can plant medicinal materials from area A in our country be introduced for cultivation in area B, but wild animal and plant medicinal materials can also be transformed into domesticated and cultivated ones. Henan, Shandong, Guangdong and other places have successfully trial-bred whole scorpions, white-banded kraits, toads, seahorses, musk deer, etc. These facts powerfully illustrate that there is no basis for saying that "authentic medicinal materials" cannot be introduced for cultivation, and that the quality will definitely not be good if they are introduced. Emphasizing "authentic medicinal materials" will only limit the development of medicinal material production and affect the supply of medicinal materials, which is detrimental to the people's health and national construction. Therefore, it is necessary to break the superstitious thinking about "authentic medicinal materials," and it should be started from the three aspects of traditional Chinese medicine management, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and traditional Chinese medicinal material production to completely overcome the idea of not managing, not prescribing, and not daring to produce non-"authentic medicinal materials," vigorously plant medicinal materials that were not originally produced locally, carry out the domestication and cultivation of wild animal and plant medicinal materials, and increase the output of traditional Chinese medicinal materials.
    Does the implementation of the principle of local production and local supply mean that we can ignore the production of "authentic medicinal materials"? Of course not! Because the "authentic medicinal material" producing areas are the bases for medicinal material production in our country. Not only is the quality of the medicinal materials produced good, but the masses also have rich production experience. It must also be seen that the introduction of "authentic medicinal materials" in various places is a trial process. After the trial planting, some areas may not be suitable for the growth of certain medicinal materials, and the part of the medicinal materials needed in these areas still needs to be supplied by other areas; many of the medicinal materials needed for export and in large cities and industrial and mining areas also need to be supplied by the original production bases. Therefore, even after the implementation of the principle of local production and local supply, the adjustment between regions is still indispensable, and the original producing areas must still plan to develop the production of "authentic medicinal materials," and should never affect the production and supply of "authentic medicinal materials" because of this. Similarly, after transforming wild animal and plant medicinal materials into domesticated and cultivated ones, we cannot ignore the protection and collection of wild medicinal materials.
    In the past period, due to the great leap forward in agricultural production, the leading forces in some regions and some agricultural cooperatives have been busy with the production of major crops such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds, and have somewhat neglected the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials. This phenomenon is understandable, but this situation must be changed. It must be understood that the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials is not only of great political significance for enhancing the people's physique and ensuring industrial and agricultural production, but also plays a huge role in developing diversified operations in people's communes, increasing income, and improving farmers' lives. In some areas, especially in mountainous areas and minority areas, the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials is an important source of non-agricultural income for farmers. For example, in Xiqiaogou Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, in 1956, the income from medicinal materials such as codonopsis, rhubarb, and green shells alone reached an average of sixty-four yuan per person, and the income from crops in the entire township accounted for only 11.2% of the income from medicinal materials. Pingshun County is only a general county producing medicinal materials in mountainous areas. In the major medicinal material producing counties in Southwest, Central South, East China, and Northeast China, the income of farmers collecting and planting medicinal materials is higher than that of Pingshun County. It can be seen from this that even from an economic point of view, the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials cannot be ignored. While taking industry and agriculture hand in hand, vigorously developing steel production, and vigorously developing agricultural production, the people's communes in various places must also focus on the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials, and "each commune should try to raise and try to plant" animal and plant medicinal materials. Various localities should make overall arrangements for closing mountains for afforestation, soil and water conservation, collection, and planting of medicinal materials; when planning labor, the labor required for medicinal material collection should also be included in the plan, so that the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials is closely integrated with agricultural production.
    The production and management of traditional Chinese medicinal materials are major issues related to sorting out, inheriting, and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. It affects the health and income of the broad masses, and involves the relationship between regions, between urban and rural areas, and between many departments. Therefore, when implementing the principle of local production and local supply of traditional Chinese medicinal materials and transforming wild medicinal materials into domesticated and cultivated ones, regions and departments are required to promote the noble communist spirit of "everyone for me, me for everyone," actively maintain close contact, communicate information, and cooperate with each other and support each other. We believe that as a result of resolutely implementing the State Council's clear policy of developing the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials, the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials will surely have a great leap forward.

    发展中药材生产的锁钥
    今天，国务院发布了“关于发展中药材生产问题的指示”。在这个指示中指出：中药材的生产要实行就地生产就地供应，积极地有步骤地变野生动、植物药材为家养家种。这是发展中药材生产和解决中药材供应问题的基本方针，也是逐步满足人民医疗需要的根本办法。
    中药材是除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病的重要物质力量，它对于增强人民体质，提高劳动生产率，加快国家的社会主义建设有重大的意义。中药是中医用于治疗疾病的必需武器，中药和中医是一个不可分割的整体。几千年来，我国广大人民依靠它治疗疾病，它对于我国民族的生存和发展有巨大的作用。自从1954年党中央发出改进中医工作的指示，坚决纠正过去卫生部门不适当的限制、排挤和歧视中医的错误以后，卫生部门对于中医问题有了根本的转变，中药的生产也有了显著的改善。从1955年起，许多省份和有关业务部门对于药材的生产作了具体的安排，有些省份将某些药材品种纳入国民经济计划，有的地方拨出了土地，建立了药用动物饲养场、药物植物种植场、苗圃，有的地方新发现了不少药源等，中药材的产量有了很大增加，1957年比1953年中药材收购总值增加642％，供应增加639％。但是，最近以来，由于工农业生产的飞跃发展，人民生活的逐步改善，以及爱国卫生运动的开展，人民对于中药材的需要量增加，加之有些地区在抓主要农作物生产中没有同时抓中药材的生产等原因，目前某些中药材的生产和收购反而有所下降。这种情况是必须改变的。否则，就会直接影响疾病的治疗，影响人民的健康和国家的建设。
    发展中药材生产的关键，是实行中药材就地生产就地供应，有步骤地将野生动植物药材变为家养家种。这样做的好处，是可以人为地将自生自灭的野生动植物有计划地进行生产，使中药材的产量建筑在比较稳定、可靠的基础上，不至于因为野生植物药材遭受自然灾害，致使采集药用植物、捕捉药用动物没有保证，或因一地歉收而影响全国药材的供应。要做到就地生产就地供应，把野生动、植物药材变为家养家种，必须破除对“地道药材”的迷信。认为“地道药材”只能产于某一地区，而且质量一定好，这个观念在人们头脑里已根深蒂固，沿习已久。有些中药材经营部门非“地道药材”不经营，有些医生处方指名要“地道药材”，人们更不敢把“地道药材”在本地引种。事实证明这是错误的。某些所谓“地道药材”是完全可以引种的。例如人们一向认为怀生地、东人参最好，生地只能产于豫北少数几个县，人参只能产于东北。但是事实上，湖北省光化县1957年引种生地十七亩，每亩高产二千斤，质量不亚于怀生地；山西省新绛县1957年由东北引种人参，今年已在五年参苗中收参籽二十斤。不仅我国甲地植物药材可以在乙地引种，而且野生动、植物药材也可以变家养家种。河南、山东、广东等地试养全蝎、白花蛇、蛤蟆、海马、獐子等都已成功。这些事实有力的说明“地道药材”不能引种，引种了质量一定不好是没有根据的。强调“地道药材”，只会限制药材生产的发展，影响药材的供应，这对于人民健康和国家建设是不利的。因此，必须打破“地道药材”的迷信思想，应当从中药经营、中医和中药材生产三个方面着手，彻底克服非“地道药材”不经营、不处方、不敢生产的思想，大力种植原来非本地生产的药材，开展野生动植物药材家养家种，提高中药材产量。
    实行就地生产就地供应的方针，是否可以忽视“地道药材”的生产呢？当然不能！因为“地道药材”产地是我国药材生产的基地，不仅生产的药材质量好，而且群众有丰富的生产经验。还要看到，各地引种“地道药材”是有一个试种过程的，试种以后，有些地区可能不适于某种药材的生长，这些地区需要的一部分药材仍然要由其他地区来供应；出口和大城市、工矿区需要的药材，有许多也要由原来的生产基地来供应。所以，即使实行就地生产就地供应的方针以后，地区之间的调剂仍然是少不了的，原产区仍然要有计划地发展“地道药材”的生产，绝不应当因此影响“地道药材”的生产和供应。同样，变野生动植物药材为家养家种以后，也不能忽视野生药材的保护和采集工作。
    过去一段时间，由于农业生产的大跃进，有些地区和有些农业社的领导力量都忙于粮食、棉花、油料等主要农作物的生产，对于中药材生产有所忽略。这种现象是可以理解的，但是，这种情况必须改变。要知道，中药材的生产，不仅对增强人民体质，保障工农业生产有重大政治意义，而且对于发展人民公社多种经营，增加收入，改善农民生活方面也有极大的作用。某些地区尤其是山地和少数民族地区，中药材生产是农民农副业收入的重要来源之一，如山西省平顺县西桥沟乡1956年仅党参、大黄、青壳等药材的收入，每人平均达六十四元，全乡农作物收入仅占药材收入的11.2％。平顺县只是山区产药材的一般县份，在西南、中南、华东、东北主要产药材的县份，农民采集种植药材的收入比平顺县还要多。由此可见，即使从经济意义来说，中药材生产也是不容忽视的。各地人民公社在工农业并举，大搞钢铁生产，大力发展农业生产的同时，也要抓中药材生产，要“社社试养，社社试种”动、植物药材。各地对于封山育林、水土保持、采集和种植药材要统筹安排；在规划劳动力的时候，对于采药所需要的劳动力也应当规划在内，使中药材生产与农业生产密切结合起来。
    中药材的生产和经营是有关整理、继承、发扬祖国医药遗产的重大问题，它影响广大群众的健康和收入，涉及地区之间、城乡之间以及许多部门之间的关系。因此，在实行中药材就地生产就地供应，把野生药材变为家养家种这一方针的时候，要求地区之间、部门之间发扬“人人为我，我为人人”的高尚共产主义精神，主动密切联系，沟通情况，各方协作，互相支援。我们相信，坚决贯彻执行国务院发展中药材生产的明确方针的结果，中药材的生产一定会有一个大的跃进。
