Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Manila: According to a recent report in the "Manila Chronicle," Philippine political leaders have expressed support for the National Economic Council's "Filipinos First" policy.

Philippine Nacionalista Party and Liberal Party members, under the leadership of Acting Speaker Castañeda, formed a united front on October 29th to support this policy.

Senator Recto also wrote a letter on October 30th to a prominent figure in the Philippine business community, praising this nationalist policy. Recto hoped that the "Filipinos First" policy could increasingly lead to a path of breaking away from foreign control to a greater extent. He emphasized that this policy is necessarily opposed to U.S. imperialism, and that whatever is Filipino or pro-Filipino must necessarily be opposed to U.S. imperialism.

However, on the other hand, Americans with large investments in the local area are unwilling to give up their huge profits. According to senior Philippine government officials, the powerful forces representing American manufacturers here have threatened to force the U.S. government not to agree to use the $50 million in loans promised to the Philippines from the U.S. Development Loan Fund to finance a batch of projects.

Columnists for the "Manila Chronicle" warned on October 31st that the methods for fully implementing the "Filipinos First" economic policy were not yet clear, and that the sweet and cunning anesthetic administered by U.S. policy was still numbing the minds and bodies of Filipinos. However, the columnists said with confidence that awakening was on the horizon.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Manila: According to a report in the "Manila Chronicle" on November 1st, some Philippine senators pointed out that the conditions attached to the U.S. providing the Philippines with a $50 million loan show that it harbors selfish motives.

Senator Edmundo Cea condemned the Americans for "not taking the Philippines seriously enough." He pointed out that, under these circumstances, the Philippines had no choice but to abandon the U.S. market and face the European and Asian markets, including the Chinese market. It is reported that the Philippine National Economic Council has also protested these conditions.

The main content of the conditions put forward by the U.S. delegation, which left the Philippines on October 30th, during the negotiations, was that if a Philippine industry's products were likely to compete with U.S. products or exclude U.S. products from the local market, then that industry would not be able to obtain a loan.

    菲律宾人要摆脱美国控制
    许多政界领袖支持独立经济政策抨击“美援”
    新华社2日讯　马尼拉消息：据“马尼拉纪事报”最近报道，菲律宾政界领袖表示支持全国经济委员会提出的“菲律宾人第一”的政策。
    菲律宾国民党议员和自由党议员在临时议长卡斯塔尼达领导下，在10月29日组成统一阵线，支持这项政策。
    参议员雷克托也在10月30日写信给一位著名的菲律宾实业界人物，称赞了这个民族主义政策。雷克托希望“菲律宾人第一”的政策能够日益走向在更大程度上摆脱外国控制的道路。他强调说，这项政策必然是反对美帝国主义的，凡是菲律宾的或是亲菲律宾的东西，必然就是反对美帝国主义的。
    但是，另一方面，在本地拥有大量投资的美国人不愿意放弃他们的巨额利润。据菲律宾政府高级官员们说，代表这里美国制造商的强大势力，扬言要迫使美国政府不要同意用美国发展贷款基金中答应给予菲律宾的五千万美元贷款来资助一批工程。
      “马尼拉纪事报”专栏作家们在10月31日警告说，充分执行“菲律宾人第一”的经济政策的方法还不太明确，美国政策所下的甜而狡猾的麻醉药仍旧麻醉着菲律宾人的身心。但是，专栏作家们满怀信心地说，觉醒已经在望。
    新华社2日讯　马尼拉消息：据“马尼拉纪事报”1日报道，菲律宾的一些参议员指出，美国向菲律宾提供五千万美元贷款时附加的条件，说明它怀有自私的目的。
    参议员埃德蒙多·塞亚谴责美国人“太不把菲律宾当回事了”。他指出，在这种情况下，菲律宾没有别的办法，只好放弃美国市场，而面向欧洲和亚洲市场，包括中国市场在内。有消息说，菲律宾全国经济委员会也对这些条件提出了抗议。
    在10月30日离开菲律宾的美国代表团在谈判中提出的条件，主要内容是，如果菲律宾的某种工业的产品有可能同美国的产品竞争或者从本地市场上排除美国产品的话，这种工业就不能得到贷款。
