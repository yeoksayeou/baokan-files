Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: Approximately four million Japanese workers, mainly members of unions affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), held their fifth joint struggle today across Japan, demanding the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and demanding that relevant departments of the Kishi Nobusuke government rescind the illegal arrests and unreasonable punishments of workers who participated in the November 5th joint struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," and opposing the Nobusuke Kishi government's re-submission of the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill." Workers held workplace rallies for thirty minutes or more during working hours.

    Members of unions such as the National Telecommunications Workers' Union, the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, the National Railway Workers' Union, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, and the General Federation of Private Railway Workers' Unions held workplace rallies in various parts of Japan. The All-Japan Federation of Agriculture and Forestry Ministry Employees' Unions and the All-Japan Monopoly Corporation Workers' Union also held workplace rallies for thirty minutes to one hour during working hours.

    The workplace rallies held by members of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union and the National Tax Office Employees' Union passed resolutions demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government withdraw the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" and decided to refuse overtime work.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: 500,000 members of the Japan Teachers' Union stopped classes this afternoon and held their fourth joint struggle. They held rallies and demonstrations in approximately two thousand locations across the country, demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government rescind the "Performance Evaluation" system, protesting the illegal suppression by the Kishi Nobusuke government authorities, and demanding increased education budgets and year-end bonuses.

    According to a report by Japanese radio, the scale of this struggle by the Japan Teachers' Union was larger than the joint struggle it held on October 28th against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law." That struggle was attended by 357,000 teachers.

    In Tokyo, 15,000 teachers gathered in five locations to hold rallies and took to the streets in demonstrations.

    The Wakayama Prefecture Teachers' Union stopped classes from noon onwards, and each branch held protest rallies. In more than thirty prefectures, including Hokkaido, Osaka, Kyoto, Kochi, and Hyogo, members of the Teachers' Union stopped classes in the afternoon according to the original plan and carried out various struggle activities.

    Komabayashi Takeshi, Chairman of the Japan Teachers' Union, said in a statement on today's joint struggle that although the enemy's suppression is becoming increasingly frantic, the teachers' struggle has recently ushered in a new high tide.

    Komabayashi said that in today's joint struggle, the prefectural branches of thirty-three teachers' unions transferred their command to the Tokyo Union Headquarters, and they launched various struggle activities together from 2:00 p.m. according to the headquarters' instructions. In the prefectures that have already implemented the "Performance Evaluation" system, the teachers' unions in more than thirty prefectures have launched struggles demanding that the prefectural education committees return the "Performance Evaluation Forms." He said that this is clear evidence of the high tide; this new high tide is obviously inspired by the victory of the Japanese people's struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and the support of the Japanese people.

    Komabayashi said that this fact proves that as long as there is the support of public opinion, our struggle will surely be victorious.

    Komabayashi stated that all Japanese teachers, while opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," also demand that it rescind the "Performance Evaluation" system in order to prevent Japan from being dragged into war, and will fight to the end to achieve these goals.

    要求废除日美“安全条约”　反对岸政府镇压工人
    日本四百万工人举行联合斗争
    五十万教职员示威要求岸政府撤销“勤务评定”制度
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：以日本工会总评议会所属工会的会员为主的约四百万日本工人，今天在日本各地举行了第五次联合斗争，要求打倒岸信介内阁，废除日美“安全条约”，要求岸信介政府有关部门撤销对参加11月5日反对修改“警察官职务执行法”联合斗争的工人的非法逮捕和无理处分，反对岸信介政府再次提出“警职法修正案”。工人们分别在工作时间内举行了三十分钟以上的工作场所大会。
    全国电气通信工会、全递信从业员工会、国营铁道工会、日本煤矿工会、日本私营铁道工会总联合会等工会的会员分别在日本各地举行了工作场所大会。全农林省工会和全专卖工会也在工作时间内举行了三十分钟到一小时的工作场所大会。
    全递信从业员工会和全国税职员工会会员所举行的工作场所大会通过了要求岸信介政府撤销“警察官职务执行法修正案”的决议，并且决定拒绝加班加点。
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本教职员工会的五十万名会员在今天下午停止上课，举行了第四次联合斗争。他们分别在各地约两千个场所举行大会和示威游行，要求岸信介政府撤销“勤务评定”制度，抗议岸信介政府当局的非法镇压，要求增加教育预算和年终津贴。
    据日本电台报道，日本教职员工会这次斗争的规模，比它在10月28日举行的反对修改“警察官职务执行法”联合斗争的规模还要大。那次斗争有三十五万七千名教职员参加。
    在东京，一万五千名教职员汇集在五个场所举行大会，并到街上举行了示威游行。
    和歌山县教职员工会从中午起停止上课，各个支部分别举行了抗议大会。在北海道、大阪、京都、高知、兵库等三十多个都、道、府、县，教职员工会的会员们都按照原定计划，分别在下午停止上课，进行了各种斗争活动。
    日本教职员工会委员长小林武就今天的联合斗争发表谈话说，虽然敌人的镇压日益疯狂，但是教职员的斗争最近进一步掀起了新的高潮。
    小林说，在今天的联合斗争中，有三十三个教职员工会的府、县支部把指令权移交给东京工会总部，它们按照总部的指令从下午二时起一起展开了各种斗争。在已经实施“勤务评定”制度的县当中，有三十几个县的教职员工会已经展开斗争，要求县教育委员会当局退还“勤务评定书”。他说，这是高潮的明证；这一新的高潮显然受到了广泛日本人民反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”斗争胜利的鼓舞和日本人民的支持。
    小林说，这个事实证明，只要有人民舆论的支持，我们的斗争一定会获得胜利。
    小林表示，日本全体教职员在反对岸信介政府修改“警职法”的同时，还要求它撤销“勤务评定”制度，以阻止日本被拖进战争，并将为实现这些目标而斗争到底。
