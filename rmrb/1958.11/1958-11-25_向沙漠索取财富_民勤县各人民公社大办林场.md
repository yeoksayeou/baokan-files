Requisitioning Wealth from the Desert
    Minqin County's People's Communes Vigorously Establish Tree Farms

    (Reported by this newspaper) To tame the desert, Minqin County in Gansu Province is adjusting its technical force and establishing forward bases. The People's Communes are vigorously establishing commune-run tree farms to shift the socialist construction cause of subduing the desert from prevention to comprehensive transformation.

    Minqin is one of the counties in the Hexi Corridor most severely affected by wind and sand. It is surrounded by the Tengger Desert of Inner Mongolia on the east, west, and north. Cultivated land accounts for only 7.5% of the county's total area. The wind and sand line is as long as six hundred li, with continuous sand ridges and dunes, moving southward at a rate of three meters per year. After liberation, the people of the county, with heroic spirit, built 45 sand-prevention forest belts along the desert edge, with a total length of more than 350 li, and erected more than 3,000 li of windbreaks, basically controlling the southward movement of shifting sand, protecting farmland and ensuring bumper harvests year after year, enabling the county to quickly embark on the broad road to a prosperous life.

    These earth-shaking changes are the result of the Minqin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party consistently adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, mobilizing the masses, and adopting the approach of "first controlling, then managing, and then utilizing." The transformation of the desert area is regarded as a fundamental measure to change the backwardness of Minqin. In the long-term struggle against wind and sand, the thinking of the masses has been liberated, transforming the initial superstitious belief that "sand is the Yellow Dragon, the more it is managed, the poorer it becomes" into the view that "sand is the Yellow Dragon, it will not work if it's not managed." Based on the increased awareness of the people, the county's cause of transforming the desert area has been continuously developed. At the same time, a mass forestry technical team has grown and strengthened in the actual struggle. The establishment of the People's Communes has created favorable conditions for conquering the desert. The original hundreds of forestry professional teams of advanced cooperatives were reorganized into 194 commune-run tree farms, so that every commune and team has a tree farm, and a group of "vanguards" were sent deep into the desert hinterland to establish six new villages in the sandy areas, which have become forward bases for subduing the desert.

    According to the experience here, commune-run tree farms have great advantages:

    First, they expand the operating front of the People's Communes, greatly increase the income of commune members. It is estimated that the sideline income from industrial fiber raw materials, medicinal materials, wild oil grains, and substitute foods alone will reach more than 3.2 million yuan this year, which can promote the great development of the commune's agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline economies. Second, they are collective management organizations on a larger scale, with unified planning and specific arrangements, which more effectively solves the contradiction between agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline industries in using land and labor. Third, according to the characteristics of the local communes, they divide labor and specialize, clarify responsibilities, grasp agriculture with one hand and forestry with the other, with two teams of people, each showing their abilities. Fourth, commune-run tree farms have sound organizations, which can not only do a good job in production, but also facilitate the study of professional and technical skills. The forestry technical schools and forestry universities they have established have reached 109. (Zhai Qining) (Attached picture)

    向沙漠索取财富
    民勤县各人民公社大办林场
    本报讯　甘肃民勤县各人民公社调整技术力量，建立前进基地，大办社营林场，把降服沙漠的社会主义建设事业，从防治推向全面改造。
    民勤是河西走廊上风沙为害最重的县份之一。东、西、北三面均为内蒙古腾格里大沙漠所包围，全县耕地只占总面积7.5％。风沙线长达六百里，沙梁和沙丘连绵不绝，并每年以三公尺的速度向南移动。解放后，全县人民以英雄的气概，在沙漠边沿营造防沙林带四十五条，总长三百五十余里，插风墙三千余里，基本上控制了流沙南移，保护了农田年年丰收，使这个县份，迅速走上丰衣足食的康庄大道。
    这样翻天覆地的变化，是中共民勤县委一直坚持政治挂帅，发动群众，本着“先控制，后治理，再利用”的方针，把改造沙漠事业作为改变民勤落后面貌的根本措施。并在长期与风沙搏斗中，解放了群众思想，使人们从最初“沙是黄龙，越治越穷”的迷信思想，转变为
  “沙是黄龙，不治不成”的看法。在人民群众认识提高的基础上，该县的改造沙漠的事业得到不断的发展。同时在实际斗争里，这里成长壮大了群众林业技术队伍。人民公社的成立，更给征服沙漠创造了有利条件，把原有高级社几百个林业专业队，改组成一百九十四个社营林场，做到社社队队有林场，并派遣一批“尖兵”深入沙漠复地，建立了六个沙区新庄，这些村庄成了为降服沙漠的前进根据地。
    据这里的体会，社营林场具有很大的优越性：
    一、扩大了人民公社的经营阵地，大大增加社员收入，预计年内仅工业纤维原料、药材、野生油粮、代食品等副业收入，即达三百二十余万元，可以促进公社农林牧副各项经济的大发展；二、它是在较大范围内的集体经营组织，统一规划，具体安排，更有效地解决了农林牧副业之间使用土地和劳动力的矛盾；三、根据当地公社的特点，分工分业，明确责任，一手抓农业，一手抓林业，两套人马，各显其能；四、社办林场有健全的组织，既能搞好生产，又利于学习专业技术，它们创办的林业技术学校和林业大学达一百零九所。　（翟其宁）（附图片）
