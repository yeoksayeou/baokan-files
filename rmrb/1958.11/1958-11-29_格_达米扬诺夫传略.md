Biography of Georgi Damyanov

Comrade Georgi Damyanov, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly, was born on September 23, 1892, into a poor peasant family. He participated in the socialist youth movement during his secondary school years. In 1912, at the age of twenty, he joined the "Tesnyak" (Narrow) Social Democratic Party, which, after being reorganized in 1919, became the Bulgarian Communist Party.

During the First World War, Comrade Damyanov was conscripted into the army. He carried out extensive revolutionary activities among the soldiers at the front. He was seriously wounded in the war. After the war, he led the working farmers in his hometown in their struggle and was elected as a member of the Party's Vratsa Regional Committee. As a result of his tireless activities, the Party's influence expanded, making this region one of the Communist Party's strongholds.

In September 1923, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people launched the famous people's uprising against the fascist government. Comrade Damyanov was one of the leaders of the uprising. At that time, he served as the commander of the Lopushna District insurgent detachment, which established revolutionary power in nearby villages and supported battles in other areas. After the failure of the uprising, Comrade Damyanov was forced into exile abroad.

From 1924 to 1936, Comrade Damyanov returned to Bulgaria several times to carry out secret revolutionary work. He carried out a series of arduous and effective tasks in restoring and strengthening the Party's organization and ensuring the Party's correct line of struggle. The reactionary Bulgarian government twice sentenced him to death in absentia. From the time of his second return to the country to carry out activities, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. From 1937 to 1943, Comrade Damyanov participated in the responsible work of the Communist International and the Foreign Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

With the decisive help of the glorious Soviet Army and under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people overthrew the fascist government on September 9, 1944, and established a people's regime. Comrade Damyanov returned to his motherland and worked in the Central Committee of the Party. From November 1946 to May 1950, he served as Minister of National Defense.

Since 1945, Comrade Damyanov has been elected as a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. In 1950, 1954, and 1958, he was elected as Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly three times. In these positions, Comrade Damyanov made valuable contributions to the socialist cause in Bulgaria.

In recognition of his merits in the struggle against capitalism and fascism and in the cause of socialist construction, the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly awarded him the "Gold Star" Medal of Socialist Labor Hero and the "Dimitrov" Medal on the occasion of his sixty-fifth birthday last year. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also awarded him the Order of Lenin. (Xinhua News Agency)
