To our dear Comrade Priesnukhin Kulikov, and to all Soviet experts who have worked at our institute:

Do you often think of us? Our Beijing Institute of Technology is a blooming flower in the great garden of Sino-Soviet friendship. In the construction of our institute, you, these excellent, technically skilled, and experienced experts, helped us establish the foundation of many specialties and trained a large number of teachers. You tirelessly answered many difficult questions for us, prepared courses even when you were ill, and often worked day and night for our studies. How can we ever forget all of this?

Your excellent work ethic, valuing the combination of theory and practice, has also left a deep impression on us. We still remember how you took time out of your busy schedules to join us in construction labor on campus, such as repairing the playground and planting trees. Whenever you arrived at the laboratory or the training factory, you would always roll up your sleeves and get to work. When guiding students in design, you would also personally demonstrate it to the students. You often said: We must pay attention to practice and to summarizing our own practical experience. This gave us great inspiration.

Now, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we are victoriously advancing along the bright road pointed out by the Party Central Committee: "Education must serve proletarian politics, and education must be combined with productive labor." We are all determined to transform ourselves tenaciously, labor valiantly, and study diligently, to cultivate ourselves into communist laborers who are both red and expert. We will always remember your teachings!

                The entire faculty, staff, and students of Beijing Institute of Technology

    永远记住你们的教导亲爱的普列斯努恒·库里柯夫同志并转曾在我院工作过的全体苏联专家同志们：
    你们还常常想起我们吗？我们北京工业学院是中苏友谊大花园中一朵盛开着的鲜花。在我院的建设中，你们这些优秀的、技术精湛、经验丰富的专家们帮助我院建立了许多专业的基础，培养了大批师资。你们不知疲倦地为我们解答许多疑难问题，抱病准备课程，为了我们的学习，经常废寝忘食。这一切，我们怎能忘得了呢？
    你们那种热爱劳动、重视理论联系实际的优良作风，也给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们还记得，你们在百忙中抽出时间来和我们一起，参加修操场、植树等建校劳动的情景。你们一到实验室或实习工厂，总是卷起袖子就下手；在指导学生作设计时，也是亲自动手做给学生看。你们常说：要重视实践，要重视总结自己的实际经验。这给我们很大的启示。
    现在，我们在党和毛主席的英明领导下，沿着党中央指出的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的光明大道胜利前进，我们都决心顽强改造，英勇劳动，刻苦学习，把自己培养成为又红又专的共产主义的劳动者。我们永远记住你们的教导！
                北京工业学院全体师生员工
