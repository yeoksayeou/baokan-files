    Opposing China is a Crime!
    Miáo Sǔn
    The November 13th newspaper reported: The Iraqi Special Military Tribunal sentenced the imperialist lackey, former Iraqi Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Jamali, to hang. The Iraqi people danced in the streets and congratulated each other upon hearing this just verdict. This is another great victory for the Iraqi people.
    This news reminded me of what the head of the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China said in Beijing:
    "During our trial of Jamali, the Prosecutor General listed one of Jamali's crimes as: Jamali supported the United States in the United Nations and opposed the restoration of the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China. We regard opposing China as a crime."
    These words moved us deeply and were very insightful. China is a country where the people are the masters, a country that loves peace and does its best to safeguard world peace, and a country that resolutely opposes imperialist aggression and enslavement. Its interests are consistent with the interests of the people of the world. To oppose China is to oppose the peace-loving people of the world, and therefore is a criminal act.
    There are two ways to sentence this kind of criminal behavior. One is what has already been done in our socialist countries and what Iraq is doing now. The other is that although these criminals have not yet been tried, they have already put a noose around their own necks while committing crimes, and handed the other end of the noose to the Chinese people and the people of the world. They have long been sitting in the dock.
    All reactionaries like Jamali cannot escape either of these two judgments.
    Thus, I can't help but think of Mr. Dulles. I wonder what he thought when he heard this news? I wonder if he feels the noose he personally put around his neck tightening more and more?
    Serves him right!

    反对中国，就是犯罪！
    苗隼
    11月13日报载：伊拉克特别军事法庭判处了帝国主义走狗、曾任伊拉克首相和外交大臣贾马利绞刑。伊拉克人民在听到这个正义的判决以后，在街头跳起舞来，互相祝贺。这是伊拉克人民的又一次伟大胜利。
    这条消息使我想起来中国访问的伊拉克人民友好访问团团长在北京讲过的话：
    “在我们审讯贾马利的时候，总检察长列举贾马利的罪行中，有一条是：贾马利在联合国中支持美国，反对恢复中华人民共和国的合法席位。我们把反对中国的行为，看作是罪行。”
    这段话使我们很感动，也说得很深刻。中国是一个人民做了主人的国家，是一个爱好和平并且以全力维护世界和平的国家，是一个坚决反对帝国主义侵略和奴役的国家。它的利益同世界人民的利益是一致的，反对中国，也就是反对世界爱好和平的人民，因而是犯罪行为。
    对这种犯罪行为，有两种判处方式，一种是像在我们社会主义国家已经做了和现在伊拉克这样做了的，另一种是虽然现在还没有对这些罪犯们进行审判，但是他们在犯罪的同时，就已经把自己套进绞索，而把绞索的另一端交给中国人民和世界人民。他们早就坐在被告席上了。
    一切像贾马利这样的反动派，都逃不脱这两种中的任何一种判决。
    这样，我不得不想到杜勒斯先生。不知他听了这条消息作何感想？不知他对自己亲手套在颈子上的绞索，有越勒越紧的感觉么？
    活该！
