Good Youth! Good Aspiration!
    Wu Hua

    Opening the October 29th issue of the People's Daily, eleven young and enthusiastic faces are lined up, full of pride, smiling at you. Who are they? What are they doing? They are cooks, child-care workers, seamstresses, rice and flour processors, and shop assistants from seven people's communes in Xingtai County, Hebei. All of them are members of the Communist Youth League. In order to ensure that the labor army lives well, they have launched a competition initiative to youth fighters across the country, determined to be good shock troops for collective welfare undertakings.

    Good youth! Good aspiration! Worthy of being good sons and daughters of our time! Don't think these are trivial jobs. You must know, in today's all-people's life moving towards collectivization, how significant it is to do a good job in collective welfare undertakings! It concerns the major life issues of millions of working people, especially 500 million farmers, not just individual households. It affects people's production enthusiasm and initiative. In some people's minds, it signifies the credibility of communism. Unfortunately, not all comrades on this front currently recognize this clearly, and not everyone is working selflessly. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to have a group of shock troops, raising their arms and shouting, breaking through difficulties, and changing the situation. Our Party has always solved the problems of life and production together. These young people happen to be showing great ambition at this time and on this point, reflecting that they are people with a communist style. In the minds of this group of young heroes, the red flag of communism is flying, throwing the hierarchical concepts of bourgeois right into the trash heap. The entire labor army will applaud, welcome, and sincerely thank them, and the young fighters across the country will respond enthusiastically to them!

    Such youth, such aspiration, can only be produced in our kind of society; the old society was neither possible nor needed. If anyone in those days had aspirations for this, they would surely be met with the fury of their parents and elders, the ridicule of relatives and friends, and the disdain of "higher" people, who would denounce them: What an unpromising child! That was a society dominated by the idea that "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with strength are governed by others," and these occupations were seen as lowly. After liberation, a glorious atmosphere of labor was established, and everyone knew that labor has no rank, no high or low status. But even in the past few years, wasn't it still common to see some young people emphasizing personal interests, always saying that this or that job "has no future"? Some were listless, "doing the work of a monk for a day, striking the bell for a day;" others were drowsy at work, energetic after work, wholeheartedly focused only on their own "interests," and even thought they were very "ambitious"! Still other young people mistakenly believed that making a great stir was ambitious, while being unknown was not. In short, these young people's minds had not been liberated. When "setting aspirations," they could not escape the chains of fame and fortune, so they carried a strong old ideology and old consciousness.

    A person must have ambition, and young people especially should have ambition. Ambition is a driving force that can propel people forward; ambition is also a goal that makes the direction clear when people move forward. Young people are generally more ambitious than not. But ambition comes in various forms. All ambition is limited by the consciousness of the times and dominated by personal thought, and it is stamped with the brand of class. The ambitions praised by predecessors may not be praised by contemporaries. Good ambitions that benefit this class are precisely bad ambitions that harm that class. The "good ambitions" promoted by the rulers of the old era were nothing more than ways to stand out, achieve high office and generous pay, get rich and start a family, become famous experts, and other ways to seek fame and profit, used to "bring glory to the family" and "honor ancestors and glorify the clan." And in order to achieve these goals, they would inevitably exclude others, attack others, and elevate themselves. Harming others for personal gain was said to be "if a person doesn't look out for himself, heaven and earth will destroy him." Only in our society, especially this year, with the great liberation of the thinking of the working people and the great development of the communist style, have such shining figures suddenly emerged in countless numbers, like a waterfall cascading straight down and an underground spring erupting.

    It can be seen that what kind of class has what kind of ambition; and all kinds of ambition can be summed up in just two categories, one is individualistic, and the other is collectivistic. In our society where communism shines brightly, all individualists who think they have ambition are actually without ambition. Individualistic ambition is not only eclipsed but also plays a role in undermining the collective. And the ambition of collectivists, no matter where it is directed, is brilliant. Those who only haggle over personal prospects and think day and night only about associate doctorates or other signs, in front of this group of heroes in Xingtai County who dedicate themselves to collective welfare as their ambition, are they not too small, too lowly, and too pitiful?

### 好青年！好志气！

    好青年！好志气！
    吴化
    打开10月29日的人民日报，一字儿排列着十一位年青、热情的面容，充满自豪感，正迎着你展眉微笑。他们是什么人？在干什么？他们是河北邢台县七个人民公社的炊事员、保育员、缝纫员、米面加工员、售货员，都是共青团员。为着保证劳动大军生活得好，他们向全国青年战士提出竞赛倡议，立志要当好集体福利事业的突击手。
    好青年！好志气！不愧是我们时代的好儿女！别以为这是些平凡的工作，要知道，在全民生活走向集体化的今天，搞好集体福利事业有着多么重大的意义！它关系着千百万劳动人民特别是五亿农民而不是一家一户的生活大问题，它影响着人们的生产热情和积极性，它在有些人的头脑里标志着共产主义的可信程度。可惜在目前这一战线上的同志，还不是个个认识清楚，人人忘我劳动。因此，就万分需要一批突击手，振臂高呼，冲破困难，改变局面。我们党从来也就是把生活问题和生产问题放在一起来解决的。这些青年恰好就在这时这点上表现出了伟大的志气，反映了他们是具有共产主义风格的人。在这群青年英雄们的思想里，飘扬着共产主义的红旗，把资产阶级法权的等级制观念抛到垃圾堆里去。全体劳动大军一定会鼓掌欢迎和衷心感激他们，全国青年战士一定会热烈响应他们！
    这样的青年，这样的志气，也只有我们这样的社会才会产生，旧社会是不可能也不需要的。那时候谁若有志于此，必定遭到父母长辈的震怒，亲朋戚友的耻笑，“高等”人士的不齿，会纷纷指斥道：这孩子多么没出息！那是个“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的观念所支配着的社会，这些行业是被看作低三下四的。解放后，树立了劳动光荣的风气，谁都知道劳动是没有等级，没有高低贵贱之分的。但就在前几年，不是还常常可以见到一些青年人强调个人志趣、老是说这样那样工作“没有前途”吗？他们有的恹恹抑抑，“做一天和尚撞一天钟”；有的上班昏昏沉沉，下班精神抖擞，一心一意只在自己的“志趣”上，还自以为很有“志气”哩！还有一些青年则是误以为轰轰烈烈才算有志气，默默无闻是没志气。总之，这些青年的思想并未解放，“立志”的时候还摆不脱名缰利锁，所以带着很浓厚的旧思想旧意识。
    做人是必须要有志气的，青年人尤其应该有志气。志气是动力，能推动人前进；志气又是目标，使人前进时方向明确。青年总是有志气的多，没志气的少。但是志气有各种各样的志气。一切的志气，都受着时代意识的限制、个人思想的支配，都打着阶级的烙印。前人所赞许的志气，未必为今人所赞许。有利于这个阶级的好志气，却正是损害那个阶级的坏志气。为旧时代的统治者所宣扬的“好志气”，无非都是些出人头地、高官厚爵、发财发家、名人专家等等求名求利的玩艺儿，拿来“光耀门第”、“荣祖耀宗”。而为着达到目的，又必然会排斥别人、打击别人，抬高自己。损人利己，却道是“人不为己，天诛地灭”。只有到了我们这个社会，特别是今年，劳动人民思想大解放，共产主义风格大发扬，这才像瀑布的直泻、地下泉的喷发，猛的涌现出了难以数计的闪闪发光的这类人物来。
    可见什么样的阶级，就有什么样的志气；而各色各样的志气，归结不过二类，一是个人主义的，一是集体主义的。在我们这个共产主义大放光芒的社会里，一切个人主义者自以为有志气，其实是毫无志气。个人主义的志气不仅黯然失色，而且起着破坏集体的作用。而集体主义者的志气，不论志在哪里，都是光辉灿烂的。那些只斤斤较量于个人前途、日夜只想到副博士或者别的什么招牌的人，在邢台县的这群把献身于集体福利事业作为自己的志气的英雄面前，不是太渺小、太低下、太可怜了么？
