High Yields Have a Way, More Harvests Have a Plan
Hebei Strengthens Wheat "Satellite Field" Management to Ensure Less Planting, More Harvesting Jiangsu Establishes a Three-Wheat Management Front to Ensure High Yields in Every Field

This newspaper, Tianjin, 16th dispatch: Hebei Province's People's Communes are actively preparing to meticulously cultivate five million mu of wheat fields, launching a large-scale "satellite field" movement, using this as the first goal to achieve less planting and more harvesting. Currently, People's Communes are taking active action in three aspects: determining plots, organizing teams, and implementing measures in the fields.

In mountainous areas, plains, and low-lying areas, people have given different names to the large-scale "satellite fields," such as "high-yield squares," "high-yield channels," high-yield "wheat seas," or "high-yield rivers," "high-yield slopes," "high-yield depressions," etc. These different forms of high-yield fields form a huge high-yield wheat satellite network. According to statistics from 39 counties in 5 special districts of Handan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, etc., by the end of October, more than 3.4 million mu had been designated as high-yield wheat squares, and in some areas, large-scale "satellite fields" accounted for 35% of the wheat field area.

In order to strive to realize large-scale "satellite fields," Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead and organized high-yield square headquarters, establishing a wheat front from top to bottom, implementing a layer-by-layer contracting and division of labor leadership method. The Cheng'an County Party Committee stipulated that "satellite fields" of more than 10,000 mu would be directly managed by the County Party Committee, those of more than 1,000 mu would be managed by the Township Party Committee, and those of more than 100 mu would be managed by the high-yield brigade. The 150,000 mu high-yield "wheat sea" organized by Gaocheng County established a headquarters for each "sea" with the commune as the unit, established a professional school, responsible for the management of the "wheat sea," and determined more than 2,800 county, commune, and team cadres, and more than 10,000 rural technicians and experienced old farmers, according to the region, to manage the plots until the harvest next year. In addition, all localities have formed professional teams for large-scale wheat "satellite fields" with Party members, League members, and activists as the backbone, adopting a combination of labor and military methods, and strengthening the wheat front by military organization such as war zones, battalions, companies, and platoons.

While delimiting squares, designating plots, and establishing professional organizations, all localities have given priority management to large-scale high-yield wheat "satellite fields." Many areas are inspecting, "grading," and "upgrading" high-yield wheat fields. After An'guo County categorized wheat seedlings, they managed them separately according to the different growth conditions of the seedlings, striving to eliminate third-class seedlings before winter. Currently, the county is also carrying out a high tide of grasping management: grasping seedling inspection, seedling replenishment, and seedling protection, grasping watering to protect seedlings (pre-freeze water), and grasping pre-freeze topdressing; it is also necessary to roll once and harrow once to prevent soil cracks and freeze wheat seedlings to death.

In the movement of large-scale "satellite fields," all localities widely mobilized the masses to conduct free airing and debates, breaking down skepticism, labor tension, and loss theories, unifying ideological understanding, and inspiring the masses to greater efforts. After the Shexian County Party Committee proposed a plan for the "Hundred Li Ten Thousand Jin River" large-scale wheat "satellite fields," some cadres and masses were skeptical, saying that this was "a toad trying to eat swan meat, wishful thinking," and that wheat could not produce 10,000 jin in mountainous areas. Through free airing and debate, the skepticism was broken by the fact that various crops had a comprehensive bumper harvest this year and that satellites had gone into space. The commune members said, "It is up to people to make things happen, it is up to people to plant the land, and not only should there be a leap forward in the mountains, but also a great leap forward."

This newspaper reported: Jiangsu Province has universally established a one-line three-wheat management leadership organization from top to bottom, organized a strong and specialized three-wheat management professional team, strengthened the leadership of three-wheat field management, resolutely achieved in-depth, thorough, and thorough work, and strived to achieve a thousand jin per mu of wheat next year.

Jiangsu Province's 33,367,000 mu of wheat and barley have basically finished sowing. At present, the focus of leadership in various places has gradually shifted to field management. In Xuzhou and Huaiyin special districts, counties and people's communes have universally established three-wheat field management headquarters or field management committees, and each production team has established three-wheat management groups, responsible for leading three-wheat management work. The professional teams have fixed plots, fixed tasks, and fixed quality, and are responsible for everything from planting to harvesting. In many people's communes in counties such as Peixian and Xinyi, work sheds have been set up on the heads of large-scale high-yield plots, and camps have been set up. While carrying out field management, they also take care of the wheat. The cadres of the communes have also clearly divided their work to the fields, and record the growth of wheat seedlings and the problems found on cards every day, and promptly study and determine management measures.

The three-wheat sown for the first time after the communization in Jiangsu Province has grown better than any previous year because of adhering to the quality of the seeds, and generally meet the requirements of dense seedlings, neat seedlings, strong seedlings, and prosperous seedlings. In order to strictly implement agricultural production increase measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seed, and density, and resolutely ensure that there are 400,000 to 500,000 basic seedlings per mu, and strive for high-yield harvests in every field, after the fall planting is basically completed, the three-wheat professional team has fully invested in the first battle of three-wheat field management—launching a large-scale seedling inspection and replenishment movement. The Huaiyin special district dispatched a million professional troops to fight day and night in the fields, checking for missed plantings, checking ridges, checking base fertilizer, checking emergence, etc. At present, more than 3.5 million mu of early wheat has been inspected once. In the large-scale inspection, cadres and the masses brought their own tools, seeds, etc., while checking, while correcting, and while replenishing, doing whatever is missing. The 2,500 mu of wheat fields inspected by the Danyang People's Commune in Jiangning County have all been supplemented with seeds, and all the sown wheat fields have been dug with drainage ditches and established a drainage system. At present, the province-wide seedling inspection and replenishment movement is developing in depth. (Jiang Weicai)

    高产有路　多收有方
    河北加强小麦卫星田管理保证少种多收  江苏建立三麦管理战线让麦田块块高产
    本报天津16日电　河北省各人民公社积极准备在五百万亩小麦田上精耕细作，开展大面积卫星田运动，以此作为实现少种多收的第一个目标。现在各人民公社正在从定方划片，组织队伍和措施到田等三个方面积极行动。
    在山区、平原和洼地，人们给大面积卫星田起了各种不同的名字，有“丰产方”、“丰产渠”、丰产“麦海”或“丰产川”、“丰产坡”、“丰产洼”等，这些不同形式的丰产田，组成了巨大的小麦大面积高产卫星网。据邯郸、石家庄、保定等五个专区三十九个县的统计，10月底就划为小麦丰产方三百四十多万亩，有些地区大面积卫星田占麦田面积的35％。
    为争取实现大面积卫星田，各级党委书记挂帅，组织了丰产方指挥部，从上到下建立了一条小麦战线，实行层层包干，分工负责的领导方法。成安县委规定：万亩以上的丰产方由县委直接包干管理，千亩以上的由乡党委包管，百亩以上的由丰产大队包管。藁城县搞的十五万亩丰产“麦海”，每一“海”以公社为单位建立指挥部，成立专业学校，负责“麦海”的管理，按照区域确定了县、社、队干部二千八百多人，农村技术员和有经验的老农万余人，分块管理，一直包到明年收获为止。此外，各地均以党、团员以及积极分子为骨干，组成了小麦大面积卫星田专业队，采取劳武结合的方法，按战区分营、连、班等军事化组织，加强了小麦战线。
    在划方、定片，建立专业组织的同时，各地对小麦大面积高产卫星田都进行了优先管理。很多地区对丰产麦田正在进行检查、“分级”和“提级”工作。安国县各社把麦苗分类排队后，根据幼苗的不同生长情况，分别进行管理，争取入冬前消灭三类苗。目前，这县还进行着抓管理高潮：抓查苗、补苗、保全苗，抓浇水保苗（冻前水），抓冻前追肥；还要普轧一次，耙一次，以防土地裂缝，冻死麦苗。
    在搞大面积卫星田运动中，各地广泛发动群众进行了鸣放辩论，大破怀疑论，劳动紧张论、赔本论，统一了思想认识，鼓舞了群众的更大干劲。涉县县委提出“百里万斤川”大面小麦卫星田的计划后，部分干部和群众曾抱着怀疑的态度说：这是“蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉，心高妄想”，小麦在山区根本无法产万斤。通过鸣放辩论，用今年各种作物全面丰产和卫星上天的事实，打破了怀疑论。社员们说“事在人为，地在人种，山沟里不仅要跃进，而且要大跃进”。
    本报讯　江苏省自上而下普遍建立一条线的三麦管理领导机构，组织了一支强大的又红又专的三麦管理专业队伍，加强对三麦田间管理的领导，坚决做到抓深、抓透、抓到底，力争明年实现小麦千斤省。
    江苏省三千三百六十七万亩小麦和元、大麦已基本播种结束，目前，各地的领导重心已逐步转向田间管理。徐州、淮阴两专区，县和人民公社都普遍建立了三麦田间管理指挥部或田间管理委员会，各生产队建立了三麦管理小组，负责领导三麦管理工作。专业队固定地块，固定任务，固定质量，包干负责，从种到收，一包到底。沛县、新沂等县许多人民公社在大面积高额丰产片的田头上搭起工棚，安营扎寨，一面大搞田间管理，一面看护小麦，公社的干部也都明确分工到田，逐日将麦苗的生长情况和发现的问题都记到卡片上，及时地研究和确定管理措施。
    江苏省在公社化以后，第一次播种的三麦，由于播种时坚持了规格质量，生长情况比过去任何一年都好，一般都达到苗密、苗齐、苗壮、苗旺的要求。全省各地为了严格贯彻水、肥、土、种、密等农业增产措施，坚决保证每亩有四十万到五十万株基本苗，力争块块高产丰收，因此，在秋种基本结束后，三麦的专业队伍即全面地投入了三麦田间管理的第一个战役——开展规模浩大的查苗补苗运动。淮阴专区即出动了百万专业大军夜以继日地战斗在田野里，查漏种、查畦田、查基肥、查出苗等，目前三百五十多万亩早茬麦都已普查一遍。在大检查中，干部和群众自带工具、种子等，边查、边改、边补，做到缺什么，补什么。江宁县丹阳人民公社检查的二千五百多亩麦田，全部补上了种子，已播种的麦田全部挖了排水沟，建立了排水系统。目前全省性的查苗补苗运动正在向深处开展。　　（姜韦才）
