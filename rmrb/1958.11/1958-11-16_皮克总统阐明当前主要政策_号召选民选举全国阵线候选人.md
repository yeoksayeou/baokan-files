Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th - According to a report by the German News Agency: President Pieck wrote a letter to all voters on the eve of the People's Chamber and local council elections in the German Democratic Republic, calling on them to vote for the candidates nominated by the National Front of the German Democratic Republic.

President Pieck briefly discussed the main policies of the German Democratic Republic in recent times in the letter. These policies are: to conduct negotiations and reach mutual understanding between the two Germanies and on the German peace treaty issue; to support the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe; to realize the economic tasks put forward by the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, to do our best to make the people's lives increasingly prosperous and happy, to continuously expand the democratic rights of residents, and to make the slogan "Common Planning, Common Labor, Common Management" a reality in the new society.

President Pieck said that the German people are experiencing a decisive and significant stage in history, and the two different social systems of the two Germanies are taking two completely different paths. The German Democratic Republic has chosen the path of peace, and its economy will develop faster than any capitalist country and West Germany can achieve.

President Pieck condemned the West German government's policy of nuclear armament. He said that the repression and terror that the Adenauer government is inflicting on the West German people can only increase the political crisis and social unrest in West Germany, and can only expand the resistance of West German residents.

Xinhua News Agency, November 15th - TASS, Berlin: On the 16th of this month, the people of the German Democratic Republic will hold the third election of the People's Chamber and the people's representative bodies of various special zones since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, elections of representatives of the People's Representative Body of Greater Berlin will also be held in the democratic district of Berlin.

As in previous elections, the parties and mass organizations of the German Democratic Republic have put forward a unified list of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic. This list includes the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Christian Democratic Union, the Free Democratic Party, the National Democratic Party, and the Democratic Farmers' Party, as well as mass organizations such as the trade union, the Free German Youth League, and the Democratic Women's Federation. The proposal of the unified list of National Front candidates reflects that the parties and mass organizations of the German Democratic Republic have a common goal: to fight for the construction of socialism, for the defense of the national interests of the German people, and for peace and the unification of Germany into a peaceful and democratic country.

This election will elect 400 members of the People's Chamber, 2,640 representatives of the People's Representative Bodies of various special zones, and 200 representatives of the People's Representative Body of Greater Berlin.

Since the National Front of the German Democratic Republic held its Third Congress in September this year, the election campaign launched throughout the country has proved that the political enthusiasm of the people of the German Democratic Republic is growing. This election campaign is being carried out under the great political and production upsurge inspired by the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held in July this year. In October this year, the industrial output of the German Democratic Republic increased by almost 15% compared with the same period last year.

As of the 10th of this month, approximately 300,000 election meetings have been held in the German Democratic Republic, with more than 9 million people participating, accounting for approximately 75% of the number of people participating in the election.

The progress of the election campaign shows that the people of the German Democratic Republic support the overall slogan put forward by this election campaign: "Common Planning, Common Labor, Common Management!"

    皮克总统阐明当前主要政策
    号召选民选举全国阵线候选人
    新华社柏林15日电　据德意志通讯社报道：皮克总统在民主德国人民议院和地方议会选举前夕写信给全体选民，号召他们投票选举民主德国全国阵线所提出的候选人。
    皮克总统在信中概括地谈到了民主德国最近一个时期的主要政策。这些政策是：在两个德国之间和在对德和约问题上进行谈判和取得互相谅解；支持建立中欧无原子武器地区的建议；实现德国统一社会党第五次代表大会所提出的经济任务，尽最大努力使人民的生活日益富裕和美满，不断扩大居民的民主权利，使“共同计划，共同劳动，共同管理”的口号成为新社会的实际情况。
    皮克总统说，德国人民正经历着历史上一个决定性的和有重大意义的阶段，两个德国的两种不同的社会制度正走着两种完全不同的道路。民主德国选择了和平的道路，它的经济将以任何资本主义国家和西德所不能达到的速度向前发展。
    皮克总统谴责西德政府的原子备战政策。他说，阿登纳政府对西德人民所施行的镇压和恐怖手段，只能增加西德的政治危机和社会不安，只能扩大西德居民的反抗。
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社柏林消息：本月16日德意志民主共和国人民将进行民主德国成立以来人民议院和各专区的人民代表机构的第三次选举。同时，在柏林民主区也将举行大柏林市人民代表机构代表的选举。
    像以前的选举一样，德意志民主共和国的各党派和群众团体提出了民主德国全国阵线统一名单，这个名单包括德国统一社会党、基督教民主联盟、自由民主党、国家民主党和民主农民党等党派以及工会、自由德国青年联盟、民主妇女联合会等群众团体。全国阵线候选人统一名单的提出，反映了德意志民主共和国各党派和群众团体有着一个共同的目标：为建设社会主义、为保卫德国人民的民族利益、为和平和把德国统一成为一个和平民主的国家而奋斗。
    这次选举将选出人民议院议员四百名，各专区人民代表机构代表两千六百四十名，大柏林市人民代表机构代表二百名。
    民主德国全国阵线今年9月举行了第三次代表大会以后，在全国展开的选举运动证明了，德意志民主共和国人民的政治积极性正在日益发展。这次选举运动是在德国统一社会党在今年7月召开的第五次代表大会的决议所鼓舞的巨大政治和生产高涨的情况下进行的。今年10月，德意志民主共和国的工业产量比去年同一时期差不多增长了15％。
    到本月10日为止，在德意志民主共和国就已经举行了约三十万个选举会议，参加的人数达九百万人以上，即占参加选举人数的75％左右。
    选举运动的进程表明，德意志民主共和国人民拥护这次选举运动提出的一个总的口号：“共同计划，共同劳动，共同管理！”
