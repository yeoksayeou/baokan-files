Editor's note: The people of Northern Shaanxi have overcome barren, disaster-prone natural conditions, completely changed the backward state of production, and transformed from a grain-deficient area into a grain-surplus area. This is very exciting news. This fact once again proves the truth that Chairman Mao spoke of, "the poorer you are, the more revolutionary you are"; this fact also powerfully educates those who love to emphasize objective conditions. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, the people of the old revolutionary base area of Northern Shaanxi will create even greater achievements next year.

    (Our dispatch) Reporter Zhu Bo reports: The old revolutionary base area of Northern Shaanxi is the region with the fastest grain growth rate in Shaanxi Province. The total grain output of the entire region this year is more than 2.44 billion jin, an increase of nearly two times compared with last year; the yield per unit area increased by two to ten times; the average person has more than 1,000 jin of grain. From now on, the Northern Shaanxi region has changed its low-yield face, and the long-term severely grain-deficient area has become a grain-surplus area.

    Due to the hazards of natural disasters such as wind and sand, mountain floods, and drought, flood, and frost, Northern Shaanxi has always been a low-yield grain area, with a yield of 40 to 50 jin per mu. After a year of hard work by the people of Northern Shaanxi, the long-term low-yield appearance has changed. At present, the autumn crops in the entire region have all been harvested, with a total output of 2.44 billion jin. The entire region has overfulfilled the three-year struggle target proposed by the Provincial Party Committee two years ahead of schedule.

    The most prominent feature of this year's bumper harvest is the large-scale increase in production. Whether in the wind and sand area, or in the hilly and high loess plateau areas with serious soil erosion, large-scale high-yield fields and high-yield "satellite" fields have appeared everywhere. According to statistics, the entire region has more than 500,000 mu of high-yield autumn fields alone, with a yield of more than 440 jin to 1,000 jin per mu; there are about 2,000 mu of "satellite" fields, with a yield of 2,000 jin to 6,000 jin per mu.

    This year's bumper harvest has turned Northern Shaanxi from a grain-deficient area into a grain-surplus area. Since liberation, the Northern Shaanxi region has been short of grain every year, with an average of only 200 to 300 jin of grain per person. Especially since 1954, more than 45 million jin of grain had to be transferred from other places every year. In 1955, the most grain was transferred, a total of 150 million jin. This year's bumper harvest has completely changed this phenomenon, with more than 1,000 jin of grain per person.

    The great victory of the people of Northern Shaanxi on the grain front was achieved through a series of struggles. Over the past year, the broad masses of farmers have used the methods of full airing of views, big contending, and big debates to fight against various conservative and backward ideas, thoroughly criticized various "Northern Shaanxi is backward" theorists, thereby raising the political consciousness of the masses and enhancing the confidence and courage of the masses to transform nature and overcome various natural disasters. Since last winter, the people of Northern Shaanxi have launched a production upsurge centered on water conservancy. Every day, more than 500,000 people brave the severe cold of minus 20 to 30 degrees Celsius and carry out water conservancy, soil and water conservation, fertilizer accumulation, and winter irrigation movements. 1,400 reservoirs were built, 56,000 mu of new terraced fields were built, 850,000 new water cellars, dry wells, and ponds were dug, and 2.77 million mu of new irrigated land was built, which is 3.2 times the original irrigated land; the area of soil and water conservation completed was more than 10,000 square kilometers, which is 1.5 times the total workload of the eight years after liberation. In addition, fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, and desert greening movements were also carried out, including 75 billion jin of fertilizer accumulated, more than double the previous year. All these have laid the foundation for this year's bumper harvest. In particular, the widespread promotion of various production-increasing measures has played an extremely important role in achieving a bumper harvest in agricultural production. For example, the amount of fertilizer applied has increased by more than two times, eliminating bare ground and planting on hard soil; the area for improved varieties has reached 80%; the area for close planting has reached about 6%, etc. The people of Northern Shaanxi have also overcome various natural disasters in this year's production struggle. Most areas of Northern Shaanxi have experienced various natural disasters such as drought, flood, frost, and freezing from sowing to harvesting.

    The more important harvest is that the people of Northern Shaanxi have found the key to winning greater victories in this victory. In this year's bumper harvest, many large-scale production increase facts have educated the broad masses, making them realize that the fundamental way to solve the grain problem is to change the old farming system of extensive planting and low yield that has been left over for thousands of years. The Northern Shaanxi region has more than 17 million mu of cultivated land, with more than 6 mu of land per person, and the most is more than 10 mu per person. Therefore, cultivation is very rough, and the yield per mu has always been around 40 to 50 jin. In recent years, the masses have gradually built area fields and terraced fields. Especially in the agricultural production movement since last winter, terraced fields have been greatly developed. This year, Yulin Prefecture alone has 230,000 mu of area fields and terraced fields, with an average yield of 440 jin per mu and a total output of 110 million jin, accounting for 8% of the prefecture's total output, while the land area only accounts for 2% of the region.

    Now, Northern Shaanxi has proposed a leap forward plan for realizing basic farmland water conservancy and has proposed a plan for agricultural production next year. Next year, the cultivated land area will be a total of 11.4 million mu, a decrease of 5.73 million mu compared with this year, with an average of more than 4 mu of land per person, of which the existing 1 mu of irrigated land must be planted well. The region has 700,000 mu of old irrigated land, with a planned yield of 2,000 jin per mu and a total output of 1.4 billion jin; 1.8 million mu of new irrigated land, with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu and a total output of 1.8 billion jin. In addition, it is necessary to ensure the planting of 5 million mu of basic fields (including terraced fields, area fields, and dry river terraces), with a yield of 700 jin per mu and a total output of 3.5 billion jin. In addition, it is necessary to sow 3 million mu of dry land, with a yield of 300 jin per mu and a total output of 900 million jin. In this way, the total output of the entire region next year will be 7.6 billion jin, with an average of 3,000 jin of grain per person. At present, the people of Northern Shaanxi are comprehensively managing the Wuding River and carrying out autumn plowing, and are actively preparing for the winter production upsurge in order to lay a good foundation for realizing greater victories next year.

    陕北老区人民向全国报捷
    一年改变生产落后面貌　缺粮区从此变成余粮区
    编者按：陕北人民战胜了贫瘠、多灾的自然条件，彻底改变了生产落后面貌，由缺粮区变为余粮区。这是一条非常令人兴奋的消息。这个事实再一次证明了毛主席讲的愈穷愈革命的道理；这个事实也有力地教育了那些爱强调客观条件的人们。我们相信，陕北老区的人民在党的领导下，明年将会创造出更大的成就。
    本报讯　记者朱波报道：陕北老区是陕西省粮食增长速度最快的一个地区。全区今年粮食总产量是二十四亿四千多斤，比去年增长近两倍；单位面积产量增长二到十倍；平均每人有粮千斤以上。从此陕北地区改变了低产面貌，多年来的严重缺粮区变为余粮区。
    陕北老区因风沙、山洪以及旱涝、霜冻等自然灾害的危害，一向是粮食低产区，亩产四、五十斤。经过陕北人民一年的苦战，多年来低产面貌改变了。目前，全区的秋季作物已全部收获到场，总产二十四亿四千斤。全区提前两年超额完成省委提出的苦战三年奋斗目标。
    今年丰收中最突出的特点是大面积增产。无论是风沙区，或是水土流失严重的丘陵和高塬地区，到处都出现了大面积丰产田和高额“卫星”田。据统计，全区仅秋季丰产田就有五十余万亩，亩产在四百四十斤到一千斤以上；“卫星”田约有二千余亩，亩产二千斤到六千斤。
    今年的大丰收使陕北缺粮区变成了余粮区。解放以来陕北地区年年都缺粮，一般的每人只有二、三百斤粮食。特别是从1954年以来，每年都要靠外地调来四千五百多万斤粮食。1955年调运来的粮食最多，共一亿五千万斤。今年的丰收，彻底改变了这种现象，每人有一千多斤粮食。
    陕北人民在粮食战线上的这一伟大胜利，是经过了一系列的斗争得来的。一年来，广大农民用大鸣大放和大辩论的方式，向各种保守落后思想进行了斗争，彻底批判了各种各样的“陕北落后论”者，从而提高了群众的政治觉悟，增强了群众改造自然和战胜各种自然灾害的信心和勇气。去冬以来，陕北人民开展了以水利为中心的生产高潮，每天都有五十多万人冒着零下二、三十度的严寒，紧张地进行水利、水土保持、积肥、冬灌等运动。建起水库一千四百座，新修水平梯田五万六千亩，新打水窖、旱井和涝池八十五万个，新修水地二百七十七万亩，为原有水地的三点二倍；完成水土保持的面积一万余平方公里，为解放后八年的总工作量的一倍半。除此，还开展了积肥、造林和绿化沙漠的运动，其中积肥七百五十亿斤，比往年增加两倍以上。这些都为今年的大丰收打下了基础。特别是普遍地推广了各种增产措施，对取得农业生产大丰收有极其重要的作用。例如施肥量增加了两倍以上，消灭了白茬和硬茬下种；推广良种面积已达80％；密植面积已达6％左右等。陕北人民在这一年的生产斗争中还战胜了各种自然灾害。陕北大部分地区，从播种到收割，经历着旱、涝、霜、冻等各种自然灾害。
    更重要的收获是陕北人民在这次胜利中，找到了争取更大胜利的钥匙。在今年的大丰收中有很多大面积增产的事实教育了广大的群众，使他们都认识到解决粮食问题的根本出路，是改变千百年来遗留下来的广种薄收的旧的耕作制度。陕北地区耕地面积一千七百多万亩，每人有六亩多地，最多的每人有十多亩，因此，耕作十分粗糙，亩产量一直在四、五十斤左右。这几年来，群众才逐渐修建了区田和水平梯田。尤其是在去冬以来的农业生产运动中，水平梯田有很大的发展。今年，仅榆林专区就有二十三万亩区田和水平梯田，平均亩产四百四十斤，总产量一亿一千万斤，占该专区总产量的8％，而土地面积只占该区的2％。
    现在，陕北已提出实现基本农田水利的跃进规划，并提出明年农业生产的计划。明年耕地面积共一千一百四十万亩，比今年减少五百七十三万亩，平均每人四亩多地，其中要种好现有的一亩水地。全区老水地七十万亩，计划亩产二千斤，总产十四亿斤；新水地一百八十万亩，亩产一千斤，总产十八亿斤。另外，保证种好基本田五百万亩（包括梯田、区田和旱川台地），亩产七百斤，总产三十五亿斤。除此，还要播种三百万亩旱地，亩产三百斤，总产九亿斤。这样明年全区总产七十六亿斤，平均每人有三千斤粮食。目前，陕北人民正在全面治理无定河和进行秋耕，并积极地为冬季生产高潮进行准备工作，以便为实现明年的更大胜利打好基础。
