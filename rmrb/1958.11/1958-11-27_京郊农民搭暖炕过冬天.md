Xinhua News Agency, November 26th: To ensure that commune members in the suburbs of Beijing have a warm and comfortable winter, many people's communes are actively helping them build kangs (heated brick beds) and start fires.

During the summer's great production campaign, commune members dismantled their sleeping kangs to apply fertilizer to the crops in order to strive for a bumper harvest. People's communes in the suburbs of Beijing are now helping commune members build kangs and prepare firewood so that they can sleep on warm beds.

Cadres of the Huangtuwa Brigade of the Nankou People's Commune in the Zhoukoudian District are leading commune members to make adobe bricks during the mornings and evenings. They have now rebuilt all sixty-plus kangs that were dismantled. The brigade has also organized more than fifty commune members to take turns going up the mountains to gather firewood for household use to heat their kangs. The Nanshao Station of the Shisanling People's Commune dismantled 1,200 kangs this year when applying fertilizer to the crops. Commune members have been making adobe bricks in their spare time, building the kangs as materials are prepared. They have now built 860 of them. The general Party branch of the station has also decided to chop the upper part of the corn stalks for fodder and distribute the lower part to commune members for heating their kangs. The entire station has more than 2,000 households, and each household has received an average of 700 jin of firewood. In order to ensure that commune members can start fires in time and sleep on warm kangs, the Mentougou People's Commune convened a meeting of the general Party branch secretaries and brigade leaders in early November. In addition to studying how to help commune members build their kangs, it was also decided to distribute two to three hundred jin of coal to each household for heating their kangs.

    京郊农民搭暖炕过冬天
    新华社26日讯　北京市郊区许多人民公社为了让社员暖暖和和过好冬天，正积极帮助社员搭炕生火。
    在夏季大生产运动中，为争取农业大丰收，社员们都拆掉了自家的睡炕，给庄稼追肥。北京市郊区各人民公社正帮助社员搭炕，准备烧柴，让社员睡上热炕。
    周口店区南口人民公社黄土洼大队干部，领导社员用早晨和晚上的时间脱坯子，现在已经把拆掉的六十多铺炕全部搭好。这个队还组织了五十多名社员轮流上山打柴，留作各户烧炕用。十三陵人民公社南邵站，今年给庄稼追肥时拆掉了一千二百铺炕，社员们抽空脱坯子，随备料随搭炕，现在已搭好八百六十铺。这个站的党总支还决定把玉米秸上梢铡下来当饲草，下节分给社员烧炕。全站二千多户，平均每户已分到七百斤柴禾。门头沟人民公社为让社员及时生上火，睡上热炕，在11月初召开了大队党总支书记和大队长会议，除了研究帮助社员搭好炕外，还决定分给每户社员二三百斤煤，以便烧炕。
