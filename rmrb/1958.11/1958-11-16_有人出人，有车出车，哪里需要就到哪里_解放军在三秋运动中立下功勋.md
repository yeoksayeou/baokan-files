Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The various branches of the People's Liberation Army deployed to rural areas across the country to assist with the Three Autumn Harvest campaign have recently returned to their respective units after achieving significant victories. The local people praised them, saying: "The People's soldiers are pioneers in labor, breaking through the critical month, achieving another great accomplishment."

The scale and duration of this year's support for the Three Autumn Harvest by the troops were greater than in the past. From late September to the present, many units have been contributing everyone available and every vehicle, going wherever they were needed. The production team of ten thousand people organized by troops in the Shenyang area, after a concentrated effort in the autumn harvest, continued to work on autumn plowing and planting. In the Guangzhou area, 80% of the officers and soldiers worked day and night with the farmers to focus on harvesting late rice and other Three Autumn crops. Under the stirring slogan of "Work hard for thirty days, break through the October leap forward, launch satellites on the steel front, and launch rockets on the Three Autumn front," the Henan garrison completely suspended training in October and deployed thousands of troops to the fields while supporting steel production.

Faced with the widespread establishment of People's Communes and bumper harvests everywhere, the officers and soldiers were full of energy and enthusiasm. Many units worked, ate, and lived in the fields. A certain unit stationed in Shijiazhuang helped the commune deep-plow land and harvest crops on more than 8,000 mu and delivered more than 2.87 million catties of fertilizer in just a few days. In the Jinan area, troops who camped in the fields worked day and night to deep-plow the land, some to a depth of more than one meter. The people of Henan praised the plowing troops, saying: "The People's soldiers are true heroes, setting up camp in the fields; the large area required one and a half feet, but you plowed two feet." Many veteran generals personally went to the site to labor and direct, and young soldiers launched red flag competitions in the fields. A certain unit that participated in the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir project fought bravely in the rain, each person plowing five fen of land per day, exceeding the task by half. The "Eighteen Warriors" of a certain unit also created the highest plowing record in the suburbs of Tianjin. Some units signed "three guarantees" contracts with local communes: guaranteeing harvesting, transportation, and thorough cleaning. A certain air force unit stationed in Xi'an often fought at night with lanterns, helping more than a dozen communes in the驻地until the fields were cleared.

In helping to concentrate on the Three Autumn Harvest, the officers and soldiers ate, lived, worked, and rested with the farmers. When the soldiers had free time, they taught the militia martial arts, and the commune members enthusiastically introduced the situation of the People's Communes to the soldiers. The militiamen said that training instructors had come; the soldiers said that this labor had provided a vivid communist education. In the fields, the army and the people were united. When eating, the army and the people politely yielded to each other. The officers and soldiers added soup and vegetables to the dishes of the older commune members, and the commune members sent their prepared side dishes to the soldiers' bowls. During breaks, the army and the people gathered in groups of three or five to read newspapers, sing songs, and chat. The commune members said that the army had great drive and that they should learn from the army; the officers and soldiers said that the commune members had high production technology and that they should learn from the commune members. When the officers and soldiers left, the commune members sent them off enthusiastically. The soldiers said, we will come again whenever you need us.

    有人出人，有车出车，哪里需要就到哪里
    解放军在三秋运动中立下功勋
    新华社15日讯　开到各地农村帮助突击三秋工作的中国人民解放军各兵种部队，在取得重大胜利后最近陆续返部。各地人民群众赞扬他们说：“人民子弟兵，劳动打先锋，突破关键月，又是一大功。”
    今年各部队支援三秋工作的规模比以往大，时间长。从9月下旬到现在，许多部队都是有一人出一人，有一车出一车，指到哪里，打到哪里。沈阳地区部队组织的万人生产队，突击过秋收之后，接着又投入秋耕、秋种。广州地区部队80％的官兵和农民一起，日夜突击收割晚稻等三秋工作。河南驻军在“大干苦干三十天，突破10月跃进关，钢铁战线放卫星，三秋阵地放火箭”的豪迈口号下，10月份全部停止操课，在支援钢铁生产的同时，千军万马开赴农田。
    在遍地人民公社化、处处大丰收的面前，部队官兵们干劲充沛，热情洋溢。许多部队干在田，吃在田，住在田。驻石家庄某部在几天内就帮助公社深翻土地和收割庄稼八千多亩，送肥二百八十七万多斤。济南地区在田头安营扎寨的部队，昼夜突击深翻土地，有的翻到一公尺多深。河南人民称赞翻地部队说：“子弟兵，真英雄，庄稼地里扎大营；大面积要求一尺五，你们翻了二尺零。”许多老将军亲临现场，边劳动边指挥，年轻的战士在田头展开了红旗竞赛。参加过十三陵水库工程的某部冒雨激战，每人每天翻地五分，超过任务一倍半。某部“十八勇士”还创造了天津郊区翻地最高纪录。有的部队和当地公社订了“三包”合同：包收割，包运，包打净。驻西安的空军某部常常挑着灯笼夜战，他们帮助驻地十几个公社直干到地了场光。
    部队官兵们在帮助突击三秋中，和农民同吃、同住、同劳动、同休息。战士们有空就教民兵习武，社员们有空就热情地向战士们介绍人民公社的情形。民兵们说，来了练兵教员；战士们说，这次劳动受到了一次生动的共产主义教育。在田间，军民团结无间。吃饭的时候，军民互谦互让。官兵给上了年纪的社员添汤添菜，社员们把自备的小菜送到战士的碗里。休息的时候，军民三个一伙，五个一团，读报、唱歌、拉家常。社员说军队干劲大，要向军队学习；官兵说社员生产技术高，要向社员学习。当部队官兵离别的时候，社员们都热情相送。战士们说，你们什么时候需要，我们什么时候再来。解放军帮助农民收割庄稼杨泽民摄
