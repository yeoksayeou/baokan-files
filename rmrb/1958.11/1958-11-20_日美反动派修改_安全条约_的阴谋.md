The current Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was signed on September 8, 1951, in San Francisco, simultaneously with the one-sided "Treaty of Peace with Japan." It and the one-sided "Treaty of Peace with Japan" are both unequal treaties by which the United States enslaves the Japanese nation.

Under the pretext that "Japan does not have effective means to exercise its inherent right of self-defense," the United States has tied Japan with the rope of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," making it a tool for U.S. aggression in Asia. The "Security Treaty" stipulates that the United States has the "right to station U.S. land, air, and naval forces in and around Japan." At the same time, it also stipulates that the U.S. forces stationed in Japan "may be used to maintain international peace and security in the Far East" and to provide "assistance" in suppressing "large-scale riots and disturbances" occurring in Japan at the special request of the Japanese government. This means that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" not only legalizes the long-term occupation of Japan by the United States, but also allows the United States to openly use military bases in Japan under the pretext of "maintaining international peace and security in the Far East" when carrying out aggression against the people of Asian countries. The United States can also suppress the Japanese people's movements for independence, peace, and democracy under the "Security Treaty."

Since the signing of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" eight years ago, U.S. imperialism has become even more unscrupulous in its oppression of the Japanese people. The U.S. occupying forces simply do not take the sovereignty, freedom, and safety of the Japanese people into account. According to statistics from the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun," from October 1953 to June of this year alone, U.S. soldiers committed as many as 33,464 various crimes against the Japanese people. They stop at nothing, from intimidation and extortion to rape, from robbery to wanton murder. At the same time, the United States has continued to step up Japan's rearmament, even assisting Japanese reactionaries in equipping Japan's armed forces with nuclear weapons, attempting to drag Japan into its atomic strategic system. As for the United States' extensive use of military bases and troops stationed in Japan in the Korean War and the recent situation in the Taiwan Strait, in accordance with the "Security Treaty," this has seriously infringed upon Japan's independence and sovereignty, putting the Japanese people at risk of being dragged into a devastating war by the United States. Therefore, for the past eight years, the Japanese people have regarded the demand for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" as an important component of their struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and the revival of Japanese reactionaries' militarism.

The negotiations between the Kishi Nobusuke government and the United States on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" completely violate the wishes of the Japanese people. Despite Kishi Nobusuke's best efforts to deceive the Japanese people with the banner of "autonomy" and "equality," this revision of the "Security Treaty" is entirely a major conspiracy between the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries.

Since October 4, when the Japan-U.S. negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty" began, two formal meetings have been held. The preparatory meeting held on October 28 for the third meeting has entered the stage of discussing specific issues such as the applicable areas of the treaty, the stationing, preparation, dispatch, and command systems of U.S. forces and the Self-Defense Forces.

In this round of negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty," the United States does not intend to give Japan the status of an "equal partner," but only attempts to change the treaty, under which the United States can only use Japan as a war base, into a so-called "mutual defense treaty," a "bilateral" treaty, and drag Japan into the water under the guise of "mutual assistance," making Japan an accomplice in its military aggression and turning Japan into a base for nuclear war. Kishi Nobusuke, who inherited Tojo's mantle, is eager to rely on U.S. support to step up the revival of imperialism and militarism, and is willing to rely on the United States in order to realize his policy of continuing to be hostile to China and expanding into Southeast Asia.

Judging from Article 4 of the U.S. plan revealed by United Press International, in the new treaty, the United States still insists on having the "right to deploy U.S. land, sea, and air forces within and around Japan as necessary to defend the Japanese area and help maintain international peace and security in the Far East." Not only that, the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" once revealed that the so-called Japan-U.S. "mutual defense treaty" proposed by the Kishi Nobusuke government will include: when U.S. forces take action as "United Nations forces," or when the Japanese and U.S. governments reach a comprehensive agreement on the actions that the United States should take regarding the situation in the Far East, Japan will "cooperate" with the United States. Article 3 of the U.S. plan also stipulates that Japan has an obligation to take action with the United States to deal with "common dangers." In other words, Japan will assume the obligation of acting as an accomplice in U.S. aggression under the new Japan-U.S. military treaty. Article 2 of the U.S. plan also stipulates that Japan and the United States "individually and jointly, through continuous and effective self-help and mutual assistance methods, maintain and develop their ability to resist armed attack individually and collectively." This clearly shows that the United States will step up the rearmament of Japan and help Japan implement nuclear armament, and make the Japanese Self-Defense Forces mercenaries of the United States.

On the issue of the scope of the new "mutual defense treaty," the United States also demands that the "common defense area" be expanded to include Okinawa, the Ogasawara Islands, and even the entire Pacific region.

It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided that the scope of the revised treaty will include all U.S. territories and "U.S.-controlled areas" in the western Pacific. Since the scope of the U.S.-ROK and U.S.-Chiang treaties also includes U.S. territories and "territories under U.S. administrative jurisdiction" in the western Pacific, this effectively realizes the U.S.'s long-planned conspiracy to establish a "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization." Kishi Nobusuke, who is eager to revive Japanese militarism, can also achieve his ambition of "dispatching troops overseas" and realizing aggression and expansion behind the U.S. chariot.

If this conspiracy of the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries is realized, the Japanese people will be dragged onto a dangerous road of war, and their few remaining democratic and free rights will be completely deprived. Therefore, from the very beginning of the Japan-U.S. negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty," the Japanese people have tried their best to oppose this conspiracy, launching a massive mass movement to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government, oppose the revision of the Police Officer Duties Execution Law, and demand the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

### 日美反动派修改“安全条约”的阴谋

    日美反动派修改“安全条约”的阴谋
    现行的日美“安全条约”是1951年9月8日在旧金山与片面的“对日和约”同时签订的。它和片面的“对日和约”同是美国奴役日本民族的不平等的条约。
    美国以“日本没有有效的工具来行使它的固有的自卫权利”为借口，用日美“安全条约”这根绳子把日本捆绑起来，使它成为美国在亚洲进行侵略的工具。“安全条约”规定，美国有“在日本国内及其周围驻扎美国陆、空、海军之权利”。同时，还规定驻日美军“得用以维持远东的国际和平与安全”，以及根据日本政府的特别要求，为镇压在日本发生的“大规模暴动和骚乱”给予“援助”。这就是说，日美“安全条约”不仅使美国长期霸占日本合法化，而且美国还可以借口“维持远东的国际和平与安全”，在对亚洲各国人民进行侵略时公开地使用日本的军事基地。美国还可以根据“安全条约”，镇压日本人民争取独立、和平与民主的运动。
    自从日美“安全条约”签订八年以来，美帝国主义对日本人民的压迫更加肆无忌惮。美国占领军根本不把日本人民的主权、自由和生命安全放在眼里。据日本“每日新闻”统计，仅1953年10月到今年6月这段时间里，美国大兵对日本人民犯下的各种罪行就达三万三千四百六十四件之多。他们从恫吓敲诈到强奸，从抢劫到无故杀人，无所不为。同时，美国还不断地加紧日本的重新武装，直到协助日本反动派以核武器装备日本的武装部队，企图把日本拖进它的原子战略体系。至于，美国根据“安全条约”，在侵朝战争和最近的台湾海峡局势中，广泛地使用在日本的军事基地和驻军，更是严重地侵犯了日本的独立和主权，使日本人民有被美国拖入毁灭性战火的危险。因此，日本人民八年来一直把要求废除日美“安全条约”，作为反对美帝国主义侵略和日本反动派复活军国主义斗争的一个重要组成部分。
    这次岸信介政府和美国进行的修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，完全违背了日本人民的愿望。尽管岸信介竭力打出“自主”、“平等”的招牌来欺骗日本人民，这次修改“安全条约”却完全是日美反动派狼狈为奸的一个大阴谋。
    从10月4日起到现在，日美双方就修改“安全条约”所进行的谈判，已经举行了两次正式会谈。10月28日双方为第三次会谈所举行的准备性会谈，已经进入了讨论条约的适用地区、美军和自卫队的驻扎、准备、出动和指挥系统等具体问题的阶段了。
    在这次修改“安全条约”的谈判中，美国并不想给日本以“平等伙伴”的地位，而只是企图把美国只能把日本作为战争基地的条约，改成所谓“共同防卫条约”这一类的“双边”条约，在“共同援助”名义下，把日本拖下水，使日本成为它进行军事侵略的帮凶，并且把日本变成核战争的基地。而承袭了东条衣钵的岸信介，因急于要靠美国的扶植加紧复活帝国主义和军国主义，也甘愿投靠美国，以便实现它继续敌视中国和向东南亚扩张的政策。
    从合众国际社透露的美国方案的第四条来看，在新条约中美国还坚持有“在日本内部和周围部署为保卫日本地区和帮助保持远东国际和平与安全所必需的美国陆海空军部队的权利”。不仅如此，日本“读卖新闻”曾经透露，岸信介政府拟议中的所谓日美“共同防卫条约”将包括：在美军作为“联合国部队”采取行动的时候，或者在日美两国政府就美国对远东局势要采取的行动问题达成全面协议的时候，日本将同美国“合作”。而美国方案的第三条也规定，日本有义务和美国一道采取行动，对付“共同的危险”。换句话说，日本将在新的日美军事条约承担充当美国侵略帮凶的义务。美国方案的第二条，又规定日美双方“分别和共同地，通过不断的和有效的自助和互助办法，保持和发展它们单独和集体抵抗武装进攻的能力”。这显然可以看出美国将加紧重新武装日本和帮助日本实行核武装，并使日本自卫队成为美国的雇佣兵。
    在新的“共同防卫条约”的范围问题上，美国还要求把“共同防卫地区”扩大到冲绳、小笠原群岛，以至整个太平洋地区。
    有消息说，日本外务省已决定，修改后的条约范围将包括西太平洋的所有美国领土和“美国控制的地区”。由于美李、美蒋条约的范围也都包括西太平洋上美国的领域和“处于美国行政管辖下的领土”，这就实际上实现了美国蓄谋已久的建立“东北亚条约组织”的阴谋。而急于复活日本军国主义的岸信介，也就可以达到“海外派兵”，跟在美国战车后面实现侵略扩张的野心了。
    如果日美反动派这一阴谋得以实现，日本人民将被拖上一条危险的战争道路，而他们仅有的一点民主、自由权利也将被剥夺干净。因此，从日美谈判修改“安全条约”伊始，日本人民就竭力反对这个阴谋，掀起了声势浩大的打倒岸信介政府、反对修改警察官职务执行法、要求废除美日“安全条约”的群众运动。
