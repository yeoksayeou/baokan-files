Zhou Axing, a member of the Simingshan People's Commune in Zhejiang Province, is a skilled healer of snakebites. From 1956 to the present, he has cured more than 210 people bitten by venomous snakes and saved the lives of 21 people. He is a representative attending this National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists.

Siming Mountain is a mountain with many venomous snakes. From the time Zhou Axing was sensible, he often heard people talk about people being bitten to death by venomous snakes. One year, his neighbor Zhou Dakang was bitten on the finger by a venomous snake and rolled on the ground in pain for four days. Because no one could treat him, he had to watch him die in agony. This tragic incident left a deep impression on Zhou Axing. From then on, he had the idea of learning to treat snakebites. One day, when he was fifteen years old, he met a beggar named A San on his way home from school. This person had a snake basket full of snakes of all sizes on his back, and he was playing with a long and large venomous snake in his hand. He thought, "He is not afraid of such big venomous snakes, he must be a capable person," so he asked to take him as his apprentice. This request was accepted by A San, and since then, Zhou Axing began a life of fighting against venomous snakes.

Zhou Axing studied with A San for a year and only learned to identify more than 40 kinds of common herbs. Later, Zhou Axing slowly understood that his master was not an incapable person, but that he was unwilling to easily pass on his skills to others. Once, his master fell ill with typhoid fever. When Zhou Axing found out, he quickly took some vegetables from home, ran to the dilapidated temple to see him, and cooked porridge and dishes for him. His master was moved to tears by his sincere care. After recovering from his illness, he agreed to teach him how to catch snakes. The master prepared various medicines for him and earnestly told him to "be clear-headed, sharp-eyed, and quick in action when catching snakes." Zhou Axing happily followed his instructions, but as soon as he put his hand into the snake basket, he was bitten twice by the snake. In an instant, he felt like a raging fire was drilling from the back of his hand straight to his heart, and he trembled all over with pain. The master not only healed his wounds, but also explained in detail many ways to treat snakebites and the names of medicines. From this snakebite, he not only learned a lot of practical experience, but also deeply realized the pain of being bitten by a venomous snake. From then on, the master taught him all his skills, one by one. Before he died, he also handed him a hand-copied ancestral secret recipe that he had treasured for decades.

After liberation, Zhou Axing began to treat snakebites independently. At first, his skills were not high, and he was very timid when treating patients. The Party Branch Secretary Zhu Gongyou encouraged him and said that the Party would definitely help him overcome difficulties. These words greatly encouraged Zhou Axing. Once, Lu Youxin of Luwang Village was bitten by a venomous snake, and his whole body was swollen overnight. Black blisters appeared on the wound, and the skin around the wound also turned black. Zhou Axing rushed to Luwang Village and saw that the condition was very serious. To save the patient's life, he had to suck out the venom with his mouth. But doing so would put himself at risk of poisoning. In order to save Lu Youxin's life, he bent down and sucked out the venom from the wound, applied herbs to the wound, and personally decocted medicine for the patient to take according to the "secret recipe" taught by his master. After a night of rescue, he finally saved Lu Youxin's life from the brink of death. On another occasion, Tang Quannian, director of the Zhu Tang Village Sewing Cooperative, was bitten by a "five-step snake" and ran around in pain, as if he had a mental illness, and his life was in danger. Zhou Axing quickly sucked out the venom for him with his mouth and applied medicine and gave him medicine to take. Two hours later, the patient calmed down, but he himself was poisoned while sucking the venom. His lips turned black and swollen, and his head was swollen. He quickly took medicine himself to recover. After Tang Quannian recovered, he said gratefully, "Without Axing, I would have lost my life long ago."

Yet another time, a fourteen-year-old girl in Dajing'ao Village was bitten by a venomous snake, fell to the ground, and felt as if her whole body was on fire. When the girl's father came to find Zhou Axing to treat the illness, he himself was having a fever and was lying in bed, having not eaten for two days. But as soon as he heard that the patient was in critical condition, he immediately got up and left. He crossed two ridges and three bays, and ran about thirty miles to treat the girl's snakebite. In order to prevent the child's wound from rotting and damaging the bones, and becoming disabled, he also specially ran to the mountain to find "wild ginseng leaves" to apply to the wound. More than ten days later, this girl was rescued from the mouth of the venomous snake again by him.

Now, Zhou Axing already knows 102 kinds of snakes and more than 70 kinds of herbs for treating snakebites, as well as more than 40 kinds of Chinese medicines. He has also taken more than ten young people as apprentices. Under the education of the Party, he has made up his mind to fight venomous snakes for the rest of his life and contribute his knowledge to the working people.

### 医治毒蛇伤的能手周阿兴

    医治毒蛇伤的能手周阿兴
    浙江省四明山人民公社社员周阿兴是一个医治毒蛇伤的能手，从1956年到现在，他已经治好了二百一十多名被毒蛇咬伤的人，抢救出二十一个人的生命。他是出席这次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的代表。
    四明山是一个有很多毒蛇的山，从周阿兴懂事的时候起，就常常听到人们谈论毒蛇咬死人的事情。有一年，邻居周大康被毒蛇咬伤了手指，痛得在地上滚了四天，因为没有人会医治，只好眼看着他活活痛死。这件惨事给周阿兴很深刻的印象。从那时以后，他就产生了学习医治蛇伤的念头。十五岁那年，有一天在放学回家的路上，他碰见了一个名叫阿三的乞丐。这个人身背一只装满大小毒蛇的蛇篓，手里还玩弄着一条又长又大的毒蛇。他想：“对这样大的毒蛇都不怕，一定是个有本领的人”，就要求收他做徒弟。这个要求被阿三接受了，从此，周阿兴开始了与毒蛇斗争的生活。
    周阿兴跟阿三学习了一年，还只会识别四十多种普通草药。后来，周阿兴慢慢地懂得，师傅并不是没有本领的人，而是他不肯轻易把技术传授给别人。有一次，师傅生了伤寒病，周阿兴知道后，连忙从家里拿了一点菜，跑到破庙里去看他，并烧粥烧菜给他吃。师傅被他的真诚关怀感动得流下泪来。病好后，就答应教他学捉蛇。师傅为他准备了各种药物，还谆谆嘱咐他“捉蛇时，心要清、眼要灵、动作要快”。周阿兴高兴地照着做，不料刚把手伸进蛇篓就被蛇咬了两口。刹时间，他感到像烈火从手背一直往心头钻，痛得他全身发抖。师傅不但为他医好了伤，还详细地讲解了许多医治蛇伤的办法和药名。从这次蛇伤中，他不但学到了不少实际经验，而且还深深体会到被毒蛇蛟伤的痛苦。从此，师傅把自己所有的本领，都一样样的传授给他。临死时，还把一本珍藏了几十年的手抄祖传秘方交给他。
    解放后，周阿兴开始独立医治蛇伤。开始时他技术不高，治病时很胆怯，党支部书记朱公友就鼓励他，并且表示党一定要帮助他克服困难。这些话使周阿兴受到很大鼓舞。有一次，卢王村卢友信被毒蛇咬伤，一夜功夫就全身发肿，伤口起了黑色毒泡，伤口周围的皮肤也发黑了。周阿兴赶到卢王村，一看病情已经很严重，要挽救病人的生命，只有用嘴吮吸出毒液。但这样做自己就有中毒的危险。为了救活卢友信的生命，他就俯身下去，吸出了伤口的毒液，又在伤口上敷上草药，并且根据师傅传授的“秘方”，亲自煎药给病人服。经过一夜抢救，终于从死亡边缘挽救了卢友信的生命。另一次，朱汤村缝纫合作社主任汤全年被“五步蛇”蛟伤，痛得到处乱跑，像患了神经病一样，眼看就有生命危险。周阿兴赶忙用嘴替他吸出毒液，并且给他敷药吃药。两小时后，病人安静下来了，但他自己却在吸毒液的时候中了毒，嘴唇发黑发肿，头也发胀，自己赶忙吃了药后才好起来。汤全年痊愈后，感激地说：“没有阿兴，我早就没有命了。”
    又有一次，大井岙村一个十四岁的女孩子被毒蛇咬了一口，倒在地上，浑身像火烧一样。当女孩子的父亲来找周阿兴去治病时，刚好他自己正在发烧，睡在床上，已经两天没有吃饭了，但一听说病人垂危，他立刻起床就走。翻过二座岭、三个岙，跑了约三十里路，去给这个女孩医治蛇伤。为了使这个孩子不致因伤口腐烂而损坏骨头，变成残废，又特地跑到山上去找“野参叶”，给他敷在伤口上。十多天后，这个女孩子又被他从毒蛇的嘴里抢救了出来。
    现在，周阿兴已经知道了一百零二种蛇和七十多种医蛇伤的草药，四十多种中药。并带了十多个青年人做徒弟。在党的教育下，他已经下定决心：一辈子和毒蛇进行斗争，把自己的知识贡献给劳动人民。
