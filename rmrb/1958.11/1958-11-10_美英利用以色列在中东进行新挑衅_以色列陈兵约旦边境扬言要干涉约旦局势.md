(Combined report from our newspaper) The development of the situation in Jordan has attracted attention since the US and Britain were forced to withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The US and Britain are using Israel as an important tool to suppress the national independence movements in Jordan and the Middle East. At the instigation of US and British imperialism, Israel is stepping up the concentration of troops on the Jordanian border, clamoring to annex the West Bank of the Jordan River, and provoking armed conflicts on the border of the United Arab Republic.

On the same day that British troops completely withdrew from Jordan, Israel concentrated a large number of troops on the Jordanian border. Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion threatened at the end of October: "If the situation in Jordan changes, the area west of the Jordan River should be demilitarized and supervised by the United Nations police force." Arab public opinion pointed out that Ben-Gurion's remarks showed that Israel could use any change in the domestic situation in Jordan as an excuse to send troops into the area west of the Jordan River. Recently, Israeli radio even more bluntly clamored that due to the situation caused by the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan, "Israel cannot ignore what happens on the other side of the border."

On November 6, an armed conflict occurred on the border between Israel and the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic. According to a statement by a UAR Army spokesman, Israeli armored vehicles and tanks invaded the demilitarized zone and shelled it. UAR artillery retaliated with an hour-long bombardment.

Israel's provocative activities have received open encouragement and support from the British authorities. On October 5, British Prime Minister Macmillan declared at the tenth anniversary celebration of Israel's founding that "Israel will play a major role" in the process of so-called "stabilizing" the Middle East. He also said that Britain and Israel have "common interests" in the Middle East. According to a disclosure by the "Al-Akhbar" correspondent in London, at a series of meetings held in London between Britain and Israel, Britain had assured Israel that once the Hashemite dynasty's rule in Jordan ended, London would support Israel's seizure of the West Bank of the Jordan River. Britain also guaranteed that if Israel's position were threatened by Arab attacks caused by Israel's invasion of Jordan, Britain would carry out military intervention. As for the United States, before its invading troops rolled out of Lebanon, it had already expressed its intention to "continue to assume obligations" to Israel and support Israel's hostile activities against Arab countries. Recently, the US and British governments have separately provided Israel with a large amount of military supplies.

The new provocative activities manufactured by the US and Britain using Israel have aroused vigilance and indignation in Arab countries. The government of the United Arab Republic has notified the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization of the recent Israeli aggression in the Hula region on the border between the Syrian region and Israel. It will also request the committee to hold a meeting to pass a resolution condemning Israel's attack. Rifaat, Minister of State of the United Arab Republic, warned that if Israel dares to invade Jordan, the Arabs will rise up to fight and give the invaders a devastating blow. Iraqi Republic Radio pointed out that imperialists should no longer fantasize about turning back the clock. If they continue to insist on following the destructive path of war, then they themselves must bear all the responsibilities arising therefrom. The Lebanese government also issued a statement stating that "the Lebanese government will maintain constant contact with the governments of other Arab countries in order to oppose any aggression by Israel against Jordan and any Arab country."

### 美英利用以色列在中东进行新挑衅  以色列陈兵约旦边境扬言要干涉约旦局势

    美英利用以色列在中东进行新挑衅
    以色列陈兵约旦边境扬言要干涉约旦局势
    本报综合报道　美英两国被迫从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出侵略军队以后，约旦局势的发展，引起注目。美英正在利用以色列作为镇压约旦和中东民族独立运动的重要工具。在美英帝国主义的唆使下，以色列加紧在约旦边境集中军队，扬言要吞并约旦河西岸，并在阿拉伯联合共和国边境挑起武装冲突。
    在英国军队全部滚出约旦的当天，以色列就在约旦边境集中大量军队。以色列总理本·古里安在10月底曾经威胁说：“如果约旦局势发生变化，约旦河以西地区应处于非军事化状态，并由联合国警察部队加以监督”。阿拉伯国家的舆论指出，本·古里安的论调表明，以色列可以利用约旦国内局势任何变化作为借口，派兵进入约旦河以西地区。最近以色列电台更露骨地叫嚣说：由于英军撤出约旦所造成的局势，“以色列对边境另一边所发生的一切不能置之不顾”。
    11月6日，以色列和阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚区的边境发生了武装冲突。据阿联陆军发言人宣布，以色列装甲车和坦克曾侵入非军事区，并进行炮击，阿联炮兵加以还击，炮轰达一小时。
    以色列的挑衅活动得到了英国当局公开的鼓励和支持。10月5日，英国首相麦克米伦在以色列成立十周年纪念会上宣称：在所谓使中东地区“安定下来”的过程中“以色列将起重大的作用”。他并说，英国和以色列在中东有“共同利益”。据开罗
  “消息报”驻伦敦记者揭露，在英国和以色列双方在伦敦举行的一系列的会议上，英国已经向以色列保证，哈希姆王族在约旦的统治一旦结束，伦敦将支持以色列夺取约旦河西岸地区。英国还保证，如果以色列的地位由于以色列入侵约旦引起阿拉伯人的攻击而遭到威胁的话，英国将进行军事干涉。至于美国，在它的侵略军队滚出黎巴嫩以前，早已经表示对以色列要“继续承担义务”，支持以色列对阿拉伯国家进行敌对活动。最近，美英政府又分别给以色列提供大量军火。
    美英利用以色列制造的新的挑衅活动，已经引起阿拉伯各国的警惕和愤慨。阿拉伯联合共和国政府已经把以色列最近在叙利亚地区和以色列之间的边境的胡勒地区进行的侵略行动，通知联合国停战混合委员会，它还将要求委员会举行会议，通过谴责以色列发动攻击的决议。阿拉伯联合共和国国务部长里法特警告说，如果以色列胆敢侵犯约旦，阿拉伯人将起而应战，予侵略者以毁灭性的打击。伊拉克共和国电台指出，帝国主义者不要再幻想使历史后退，如果它们继续坚持走毁灭性的战争的道路，那么，他们自己就要承担由此而产生的一切责任。黎巴嫩政府也发表声明，表示“黎巴嫩政府将同其他阿拉伯国家的政府保持经常接触，以便反对以色列对约旦和任何阿拉伯国家的任何侵略”。
