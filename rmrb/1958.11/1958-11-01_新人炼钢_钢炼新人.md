    New People Smelting Steel, Steel Smelting New People
    Hubei: Creating New Smelting Methods
    Schools at all levels in Hubei are opening up steel flowers in a big way. In the Wuhan area alone, 29 universities, colleges, and technical schools have built nearly a thousand indigenous blast furnaces. In the mass upsurge of factory construction and production, many new smelting methods have been created. As can be seen from the Hubei Pavilion, Wuhan University is directly smelting steel from ore; the Central China Institute of Technology is smelting steel using "monkey furnaces". These two schools' practices have played a leading role in the province. Schools are also running machine factories on a large scale. Universities, colleges, and technical schools in the Wuhan area alone have produced tens of thousands of kilograms of castings, and by the end of the year, they will be able to produce 646 machine tools. On display here are dynamically balanced machines, hydraulic copying tool rests, China's first Chinese automatic typesetting machine, and various new lathes and other machines that have reached international standards; there are also various bamboo and wood machines that can save the country a large amount of steel. The displayed motors, electrical appliances, electronic technology, and various instruments are all new products creatively made by teachers and students in productive labor, such as 48 pairs of thermocouples that exceeded the China Academy of Sciences' planned research projects four years ahead of schedule, as well as secondary and tertiary transistors, which are also new products that have reached international standards. The exhibits also include achievements in agriculture, medicine, water conservancy, construction, transportation, geological surveying, and other fields. In the Wuhan area of Hubei alone, universities, colleges, and technical schools have established 1,166 factories, producing more than 3,000 kinds of products, conducting more than 7,000 scientific research projects, and proposing more than 20,000 technical innovations and rationalization proposals.
    Hunan: Massively Smelting Various Metals
    Hunan is a place rich in non-ferrous metals. From the exhibits in the Hunan Pavilion, people can see that teachers and students in schools across Hunan are extensively carrying out geological prospecting, exploration, mining, ore dressing, and smelting activities. In just half a year, the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy alone had 915 people participating in geological prospecting, exploration, and mapping work, drilling more than 3,000 meters, mapping an area of more than 13,000 square kilometers, and submitting various mineral prospect reserves totaling more than 31 billion tons. 196 mineral sites have been handed over to production units. In terms of smelting, schools are not only smelting copper and aluminum, but also uranium.
    In terms of iron and steel smelting, it is even more of a surging, massive undertaking. By the end of September, schools across the province had set up 1,313 iron and steel plants. Five universities alone had deployed 10,000 people into the battle. Changsha No. 8 Middle School is mining its own ore sources to smelt iron and steel, and it is currently able to produce 250 tons of iron ore sand and 4 tons of pig iron per day. Their slogan at work is: "Mountains are not higher than our enthusiasm, and stones are not harder than our determination!"
    As can be seen in the exhibits, many schools have already made great achievements in scientific research. Hunan Medical College alone has completed more than 1,000 scientific research projects, 89 of which have reached or exceeded international standards.

    新人炼钢　钢炼新人
    湖北：创造冶炼新法
    湖北各级学校大开钢铁之花。仅武汉地区二十九所高等学校和中等专业学校就建了近千个土高炉。在群众性的建厂和生产的高潮中，创造了许多新的冶炼方法。从湖北馆可以看到，武汉大学从矿石直接炼钢；华中工学院用猴子炉炼钢。这两个学校的作法在全省起了带头作用。各校还大办机械工厂，武汉地区高等学校及中等专业学校仅铸件就生产了十几万公斤，到年底可生产工作母机六百四十六台。这里展出的有达到国际水平的动平衡机、油压仿形刀架、我国第一台中文自动排字机及各种新式车床和其他机器；也有可以给国家节省大量钢铁的各类竹木制的机器。展出的电机、电器、电子技术以及各类仪表，都是教师、学生们在生产劳动中创造性制出的新产品，像提前四年超额完成中国科学院规划研究项目的四十八对热电堆，还有二级和三级晶体管等也都是达到国际水平的新产品。展品中还有农、医、水利、建筑、运输、地质勘测等各方面成就。仅湖北武汉地区大专及中专学校就办了一千一百六十六个工厂，生产了三千多种产品，进行了七千多项科学研究，提出了二万多项技术革新和合理化建议。
    湖南：大炼各种金属
    湖南是盛产有色金属的地方。从湖南馆的展品中，人们可以看到湖南各地学校的师生们，广泛地开展了地质普查、勘探、采矿、选矿和冶炼活动。仅中南矿冶学院一个学校在半年中就有九百一十五人参加了地质普查、勘探、描图工作，共钻探三千多公尺，填图面积达一万三千多平方公里，上交各种矿产远景储量达三百一十多亿吨，已交生产单位的矿点达一百九十六个。各学校在冶炼方面，不但炼铜、炼铝，还炼出了铀。
    在炼铁炼钢方面，更是万马奔腾，声势浩大。到9月底止，全省学校已办起钢铁厂一千三百一十三个，仅五所高等学校即有万人投入了战斗。长沙市第八中学自找矿源炼钢铁，目前已能日产铁矿砂二百五十吨，日产生铁四吨，他们在工作中的口号是：“山高高不过干劲，石硬硬不过决心”。
    在展品中可以看到，许多学校在科学研究方面已经取得了巨大成就。湖南医学院一个学校就完成科学研究项目千余项，其中有八十九项已达到或超过国际水平。
