Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The spokesman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China issued a statement regarding the Thai authorities' unreasonable persecution of overseas Chinese.

Recently, the Thai authorities, under the pretext of overseas Chinese engaging in "communist subversive activities," have continuously arrested overseas Chinese on a large scale in Bangkok and various provinces, searched overseas Chinese shops and schools, and closed down overseas Chinese newspapers. This serious act of persecution has aroused the indignation and unease of overseas Chinese in Thailand. We cannot but express our concern about this and are paying serious attention to the development of the situation.

This act of the Thai authorities persecuting overseas Chinese is by no means accidental. It is the result of the Thai authorities, under pressure from the United States, further following the US policy. In order to salvage a series of failures it has suffered in the Middle East, especially in the Taiwan Strait area, the United States is stepping up its control over the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries, forcing these countries to implement policies that follow the United States even more closely, and provoking relations between these countries and our country. The so-called overseas Chinese engaging in "communist subversive activities" is merely a smokescreen used by the United States to cover up its aggression and expansion in Southeast Asia.

Everyone knows that our country has always adhered to the spirit of the Bandung Conference, advocating friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries, and teaching overseas Chinese to abide by the laws of their countries of residence, not to participate in local political disputes, and to engage in construction undertakings that are beneficial to the local national economy and the people's livelihood. Our country has always advocated peaceful coexistence with Thailand based on these principles.

However, the Thai authorities have disregarded our country's consistent friendly attitude and the wishes of the people of both countries, violated internationally recognized basic human rights, persecuted innocent overseas Chinese, and infringed upon the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. This is an unfriendly act towards our country.

The Thai authorities should immediately stop the persecution of overseas Chinese, release the arrested overseas Chinese, and unseal the sealed overseas Chinese newspapers; otherwise, the Thai authorities will bear all the consequences arising therefrom.

### 我华侨事务委员会发言人发表声明  泰国当局应立即停止迫害华侨

    我华侨事务委员会发言人发表声明
    泰国当局应立即停止迫害华侨
    新华社3日讯　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会发言人为泰国当局无理迫害华侨发表声明。
    最近，泰国当局以所谓华侨从事“共产主义颠覆活动”为名，接连在曼谷和各府大肆逮捕华侨，搜查华侨的商店和学校，封闭华侨的报馆。这种严重的迫害行为，已经引起泰国华侨的愤慨和不安。我们对此不能不表示关切，并且严重注意着事态的发展。
    这次泰国当局迫害华侨的行为绝不是偶然的，它是泰国当局在美国的压力下，进一步追随美国政策的结果。美国为了挽救他在中近东、特别是在台湾海峡地区所遭受的一连串失败，正在加紧控制东南亚条约组织国家，迫使这些国家执行更加追随美国的政策，并且挑拨这些国家和我国的关系。所谓华侨从事“共产主义颠覆活动”不过是美国用来掩盖他在东南亚进行侵略和扩张的烟幕而已。
    谁都知道，我国一贯坚持万隆会议的精神，主张亚非各国友好合作，并且教导华侨遵守侨居国的法令，不参加当地的政治纷争，从事有利于当地国计民生的建设事业。我国从来就是本着这些原则主张同泰国和平相处的。
    但是泰国当局竟无视我国一贯的友好态度和两国人民的愿望，违反国际公认的基本人权，迫害无辜华侨，侵犯华侨的正当权益。这是对我国不友好的行为。
    泰国当局应该立即停止迫害华侨的行为，释放被捕的华侨，启封被封的华侨报馆，否则，泰国当局就要承担由此而产生的一切后果。
