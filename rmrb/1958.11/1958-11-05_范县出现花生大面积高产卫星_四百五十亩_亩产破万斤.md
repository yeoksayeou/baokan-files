Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: The Fan County People's Commune in Shandong Province has surpassed the "Peanut Girl" of the Red Hero Commune in Hongan County, Hubei Province, and broken the record of 40,719 jin of peanuts per mu.

The 450 mu of peanuts in the Wangzhuangji Management Area of the Fan County People's Commune have been harvested and dug up, yielding a total of 5,321,250 jin of peanuts, with an average yield of 11,825 jin per mu. Among them, the five mu planted by Xie Huiyu, the first secretary of the county party committee, and six others, produced a "satellite" with a yield of 53,408.5 jin per mu.

This year, the peanuts here grew so densely that the soil was not visible. Each plant had as many as three or four hundred pods, and at least one hundred and sixty. All the peanut kernels are large and full. In previous years, about 180 dried peanuts weighed about one jin, but this year, 160 weigh one jin. This peanut field has attracted a lot of attention, and people from both inside and outside the province are coming to visit and learn from the experience.

The reason why these 450 mu of peanuts have achieved such high yields is that, in addition to using improved varieties, deep plowing to replace the soil, and spraying phosphorus outside the roots, the main method used was soil addition around the seedlings (soil cultivation at the roots). The benefits of soil cultivation are: it facilitates the timely entry of fruit needles into the soil, expands the fruiting range, and cultivating the soil three times can result in four layers of fruit. Because the seedlings and vines were too dense to step through, people used methods such as building frames and bridges, erecting iron wires, transporting soil in the air, and operating on the frames to cultivate the soil.

    范县出现花生大面积高产卫星
    四百五十亩　亩产破万斤
    据新华社济南讯　山东省范县人民公社后来居上，打破了湖北省红安县红色英雄公社“花生姑娘”创造的亩产花生四万零七百一十九斤的纪录。
    范县人民公社王庄集管理区的四百五十亩花生已收刨完毕，共收花生五百三十二万一千二百五十斤，平均亩产一万一千八百二十五斤。其中由县委第一书记谢惠玉等七人种植的五亩，放出亩产五万三千四百零八点五斤的“卫星”。
    这里的花生今年长的撒土不漏，每墩多的三四百个果，少的也有一百六十多个。全部花生粒大成实。往年一百八十个干果约一斤重，今年一百六十个就有一斤。这片花生地引起了人们很大的注意，省内外前来参观和学习经验的络绎不绝。
    这四百五十亩花生所以取得高额丰产，除了选用良种、深翻换土、根外喷磷等措施外，主要是使用了拥土围秧（根部培土）的办法。培土的好处是：便于果针及时入土，扩大结果范围，培三次土可结四层果。由于秧蔓过密，无法插足，人们采用了搭架造桥、架设铁丝、空中运土、架上操作的方法来培土。
