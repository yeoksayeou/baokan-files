The Glorious Era, The Glorious People
Song Qingling

Due to health issues, I haven't been out much this year. However, the Great Leap Forward that emerged in our country after the rectification campaign has strongly drawn me to go out and see the unprecedented miracles created by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party with soaring enthusiasm. This wish was fulfilled as soon as I was able to walk. On October 17th, I went to the Shanghai State No. 17 Cotton Mill, and on the 18th, I went to the "July 1st" People's Commune in Shanghai County. In these two places, I met Party and government leaders, as well as workers and farmers who were engaged in production; I met Zhu Yingru, an old worker who had participated in the "February 7th" General Strike, and Chen Linzhen, a female commune member and production expert in her fifties; I also met Huang Baomei, a young national model worker, and the young men and women of the Youth Satellite Camp; I also met cadres from government offices, young students, and Young Pioneers who were working in workshops and fields. Their labor enthusiasm and communist moral qualities, their wisdom and creative spirit deeply moved me. Although it was only a short two days, I learned a lot, which can truly be said to be "better than reading books for ten years." I have been very excited and have had many feelings since I returned. I feel that we should greatly praise this era and greatly praise our people.

The People's Soaring Enthusiasm and Communist Labor Attitude

What did I see! What impressed me the most!

First is the people's soaring enthusiasm and communist labor attitude. The Shanghai State No. 17 Cotton Mill increased production by 33% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year, which is a huge increase in the textile industry. In order to increase production, workers created many miracles, with countless stories to tell. For example, working hard day and night to attack superior yarn, eliminating joint white spots in five hours, and working hard eight days and nights to increase car speed by 30%. There were five miracles in one day and night. Under this Great Leap Forward situation, the factory director and Party secretary took the lead in moving to the factory to live, and the workers also moved into the factory. A master in the repair shop did not sleep for six days and six nights. Due to the increase in production speed, the power supply was insufficient, and additional power supply equipment had to be added. It was estimated that it would take thirty-six shifts of work. After repeated discussions, it was compressed to six shifts, and it was completed in only four shifts.

The driving force behind the textile workers' production enthusiasm is primarily the agricultural Great Leap Forward. The workers cheered when they heard about the bumper harvest in agriculture and were determined to compete with the farmers in enthusiasm. This year, cotton production doubled compared to last year, and textile workers want to turn this cotton into yarn and cloth. Therefore, workers are striving to increase production by 50% in the fourth quarter and 100% next year.

On the other hand, I saw that the farmers' enthusiasm was also amazing. The Youth Satellite Camp of the "July 1st" People's Commune is fertilizing wheat fields that have been deeply ploughed to five feet, and the yield target for this wheat field next year is 100,000 jin per mu. The first battle after the establishment of the "July 1st" People's Commune was deep plowing. The farmers worked late into the night and deeply ploughed more than 3,500 mu in six days. One production team worked until three or four o'clock in the morning and was unwilling to rest. The Party secretary tried to persuade them, but they would not listen. At this moment, several other production teams came to support them with gongs and drums.

The current characteristics of labor are, first, sufficient enthusiasm, and second, high communist ideology. In the past, agricultural production cooperatives often could not cooperate well, but now mutual support and mutual assistance among production teams of the people's commune has become a common practice. In the competition to eliminate joint white spots at the Shanghai State No. 17 Cotton Mill, Huang Baomei first taught the technology to her competitors, allowing the other group to surpass her own group. This would not be possible without communist ideology. This soaring enthusiasm of the working people is clearly not for themselves, not for getting a few more work points or wages. They work hard day and night and have long broken through the eight-hour work system. The work of the cadres is often not to encourage the workers to work, but to mobilize them to go back to rest. Such selfless labor is not for reward. I saw a big-character poster at the Shanghai State No. 17 Cotton Mill written by all the staff of the supply and marketing department, who voluntarily requested the cancellation of the department's quarterly bonus system. The "Huang Baomei" film, from the screenwriter to the actors, were all factory employees, and they declined the film company's remuneration. From these examples, I saw the communist labor attitude of "working for everyone without taking remuneration." This is the communist style. This style is like high mountains and steep ridges, which cannot be understood or reached by those imperialist dwarfs and people who are mired in the quagmire of bourgeois ideology.

The Great Leap Forward in our country's production and the soaring enthusiasm of the working people are due to the correct leadership of the Party, the great promotion of communist ideology, and their realization that labor is not for themselves, but for socialist construction, for surpassing the most advanced capitalist countries in production, for making it so that China's 600 million people do not need to pay for food and clothing, and for the early realization of communism. Under the leadership of the Party, all the people of our country are voluntarily and selflessly working towards such a great goal. Isn't it an earth-shattering thing that the material wealth and spiritual outlook of 600 million people are rapidly increasing and changing?

The Working People Have Truly Become the Masters of the Country

Secondly, what impressed me the most was that the working people have truly become the masters. They are the masters of the country. During the rectification campaign at the Shanghai State No. 17 Cotton Mill, more than 8,000 workers posted 150,000 big-character posters. When establishing the people's commune, the masses had a very high enthusiasm for setting up the commune. Each production team wrote an application. Some wrote the application at night and sent it to the commune with gongs and drums overnight, and then went back to work overtime and engage in production, proposing the slogan "Do a good job in production and welcome joining the commune." Only when the working people feel that they are the masters of the country and consider the collective interest with the attitude of a master can such initiative emerge.

I saw such changes: workers have changed from slaves of machines to masters of machines. The movement of female workers repairing machines, advocated by Huang Baomei, best illustrates this point. Traditionally, female workers only operated the machines, and if the machine broke down, they had to wait for the maintenance workers to repair it. Huang Baomei wanted to improve work efficiency, and the best way was for female workers to be able to repair the machines. However, the maintenance workers disagreed, believing that female workers could not do the work of repairing machines. Thus, a debate unfolded over whether or not to be the master of the machine. As a result, the female workers learned to repair the machines and repaired them as soon as they broke down, which greatly improved work efficiency. Now, the Shanghai State No. 17 Cotton Mill has universally launched the campaign to learn from Huang Baomei, and everyone is becoming the master of the machine. When workers become the masters of machines, they can more boldly carry out technological revolution and create and invent machines. Zhu Xingfa, a master in the repair shop of the Shanghai State No. 17 Cotton Mill, created an electrostatic spinning machine that can spin cotton directly into fine yarn. It is said that capitalist countries had this invention, but the capitalists believed that this invention was not conducive to their extraction of profits, so they bought the newly invented machine and destroyed it.

At the same time as the workers became the masters of the machines, the farmers became the masters of the land. A saying is circulating among the farmers: "How bold people are, how much the land yields." The main factor determining the harvest is people, not simply relying on the sky and the land as in the past. The bumper harvests of rice and cotton I saw in the "July 1st" People's Commune were previously unimaginable. Next to the high-yielding cotton field was a cotton field of a single household. The farmers said that the cotton in the commune was as tall as a person, while the cotton of the single household was only a foot tall. What a stark contrast this is! I saw a moving scene in the entire field. Colorful flags fluttered along the field roads, the farmers sang loudly, and countless fumigation soil kilns for accumulating fertilizer emitted thick smoke. The farmers engaged in deep plowing and accumulated fertilizer to turn the land over and provide it with sufficient nutrition, for the purpose of launching satellites again in next year's agricultural production and doubling grain production again. In the past, farmers were bound to the land and lived at the mercy of fate. The conservative ideas of the past small-scale peasant economy have been eliminated almost without a trace, replaced by the boldness to think and act, the new farmers who command the land and harness nature.

Moreover, today the working people have not only become the masters of production, but are also becoming the masters of culture. The Shanghai State No. 17 Cotton Mill eliminated illiteracy in six days, and then established the Red and Expert School. More than 5,000 workers have enrolled, and they will reach the level of graduating from textile vocational schools within four years. After work, the Red and Expert School carries out political, cultural, and technical activities, and these activities are closely integrated with production. Factories run schools, and workers not only want to be the masters of production, but also the masters of culture; factories not only produce material wealth, but also cultivate communist new people. When Shanghai was just liberated, Huang Baomei was still illiterate, but now she is a student in the fifth class of the Red and Expert School. She is not only a production expert and a model worker, but also often writes articles for newspapers. She is an actress in the factory's Yue opera troupe, and plays herself in the "Huang Baomei" film, and is recognized as an excellent actress. Now the factory workers have collectively written a script called "Class 36 to Class 4," and even more people are writing poetry. Recently, many poems have been written around the topic of "Day and Night."

In the "July 1st" People's Commune, the work of eliminating illiteracy has also been basically completed, and the Red and Expert School has also been established. Blackboard newspapers and artistic performances have appeared in the fields, which greatly encourage production. Now they are preparing to hold a farmers' literary and artistic performance and a sports meeting for the entire commune. I have eaten in the canteens of the Shanghai State No. 17 Cotton Mill and the "July 1st" People's Commune. The food is not bad, and the cleanliness and hygiene are done very well. The canteen of the 10th Production Team of the "July 1st" People's Commune is in Zhu Chenjiazhai, which is already a "seven-without village." While eating, the commune's radio station broadcast music, followed by reporting the commune's production news.

The working people have become the masters of culture, and physical laborers are rapidly mastering cultural knowledge. This, combined with another phenomenon I saw—factory management personnel going to the workshops to work, and government officials and young students going to the countryside and factories to participate in physical labor—will gradually eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor. I have already seen the fact that some people are both workers or farmers and also poets, actors, and inventors. This shows that the working people are the most intelligent, and once the working people master cultural knowledge, they will have endless power, and there is nothing they cannot do.

The Thorough Liberation of Women's Labor Force

Furthermore, I have gained a deep impression on the liberation of women. The broad masses of women have been liberated from heavy housework and have participated in social work and production labor, and have obtained a completely equal position with men, with the same opportunities to participate in work and equal pay for equal work, so that the labor force of women has been thoroughly liberated, which is a great emancipation for women. 70% of the workers in the Shanghai State No. 17 Cotton Mill are female workers, and more than 20,000 of the more than 30,000 labor forces in the "July 1st" People's Commune are women (many men in the suburbs work in Shanghai factories). It is these women who have created miracles in their labor. Especially after the establishment of the People's Commune, the liberation of women can be seen even more. Before the establishment of the commune, although women could also participate in labor, they were entangled in housework, such as cooking, taking care of children, sewing clothes, washing clothes, etc., and they still could not be equal to men. After the establishment of the People's Commune, life has become collectivized, with canteens for eating, nurseries for taking care of children, and even washing clothes is the responsibility of someone else. Only under this circumstance can the labor force of women be truly liberated.

This time I came into contact with many women. Some of them are deputy factory directors, Party secretaries, Youth League secretaries, model workers, production team leaders, workers, and farmers. Some of them are old and some are young. There is not a trace of the kind of inferiority that was often shown in front of men in the past. They are cheerful, dare to speak and dare to do, and are full of enthusiasm. Looking at those girls who are active in the fields, they are so vigorous, so energetic, and radiating the brilliance of labor all over their bodies, one cannot help but think that people's aesthetic views have changed. The exploiting classes regard weakness, slenderness, and melancholic illness as beautiful conditions, while in the eyes of the working people, this is ugly and decadent.

I remember Chairman Mao recently said: "If everyone does not have one or two thousand jin of grain per year, there are no public canteens, no homes for the elderly, no nurseries, no elimination of illiteracy, no primary schools, middle schools, and universities, women cannot be completely liberated." Our work today, and only our work like this, can truly achieve the goal of completely liberating women.

Communist Society is No Longer a Distant Thing

In general, due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao combined with the soaring enthusiasm of the people, the situation of today's Great Leap Forward has been formed. This is an era of great liberation of productive forces, an era of great liberation of thought, an era in which the relationship between people and people and people's spiritual outlook are undergoing profound changes, and an era of miracles. Doubling the output of major industrial and agricultural products in one year is unimaginable in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, but we have created such a record; the broad masses of the people are working selflessly, without being forced, without counting working hours, without counting working conditions, without counting rewards, working hard day and night with a cheerful mood; cadres and intellectuals participate in physical labor, school classrooms are expanded to workshops and fields, factory leaders work in shifts with workers, and "labor" has changed from humble to glorious, and "labor" has changed from people's obligation to a right: the broad masses of working people want to be the masters of culture, the working people want to be both civil and military, factories produce poetry, produce movies, produce inventions, and farmland produces blackboard newspapers, produces artistic performances, and produces agricultural science; People's communes have emerged in our country, and the thinking of 500 million farmers is not only to engage in socialism, but also to engage in communism. All of this is a miracle, but it is also a historical necessity. The facts are exactly like this, words of description will only feel insufficient and will never be exaggerated, and the deliberate distortions and slanders of those imperialists and reactionaries can only appear pitiful and ridiculous. Floating clouds cannot block the sun!

The situation of the Great Leap Forward in our country is a historical necessity, and is the result of the correct leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party. Through the rectification campaign, the Party's prestige among the people has been raised to an unprecedented level. The Party raises the people's thinking to a new height in every movement, and the masses trust the Party more and are more closely united around the Party. The masses see farther, and their enthusiasm is greater. What the people see today is not only the rapid construction of a socialist society, but also that the transition to a communist society is not such a distant thing. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, 600 million Chinese people are united like one person. Wherever the Party points, the people go. With this strength, we can make high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way; we can achieve food and clothing in a not too long period of time, and we can catch up with and surpass the production level of advanced capitalist countries in a few years. With this strength, we can make a huge contribution to the cause of world peace. The US imperialism is creating a tense situation in the Taiwan Strait and carrying out crazy war provocations against us, which can only accelerate its demise. With the support of peace-loving people all over the world, our 600 million people are tightening the noose on the one hand and engaging in the Great Leap Forward in production on the other. Therefore, we have sufficient strength and confidence to liberate Taiwan and other coastal islands, and have sufficient strength and confidence to ultimately unify all the territory of our country, so as to maintain peace in the Far East and the world.

This is an era of the prosperity of communist thought, and an era in which the people are the masters of the country. With the leadership of the Party, the people will destroy all outdated things, and the imperialists and reactionaries will be cleared away by the people like garbage; the people will build a brand-new society, a society that people have dreamed of for many generations but have not realized, a society that eliminates all inequality, where social products are extremely abundant, and people's moral qualities are extremely noble "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" society, this is a society that ultimately achieves lasting peace--a communist society.

We are in such a glorious era, and we have such glorious people. Let us sing the praises of our people with the most beautiful voices, and let us promote this era to fly forward towards a more glorious and brilliant tomorrow!

    光辉的时代　光辉的人民
    宋庆龄
    由于身体不适，今年有很长一段时间我没有出过门，但是整风后在我国出现的大跃进的局面强烈地吸引着我，要出去看看全国人民在党的领导下，以冲天干劲创造的史无前例的奇迹。这个愿望在我刚刚能够走动的时候就实现了。10月17日我到了上海国棉十七厂，18日到了上海县“七一”人民公社。在这两个地方我接触了党政领导人，也接触了正在进行生产的工人和农民；接触了曾参加过“二七”大罢工的老工人朱英如和五十多岁的女社员、生产能手陈林贞，也接触了年轻的全国劳动模范黄宝妹和青年卫星营的小伙子和姑娘们；还接触了正在车间、田间从事劳动的机关干部、青年学生和少先队员们。他们的劳动热情和共产主义道德品质、他们的智慧和创造精神深深地感动了我。虽然是短短的两天时间，却使我学习了很多东西，真可以说是“胜读十年书”。回来后一直很兴奋，感触也很多，我觉得应该大大歌颂我们这个时代、大大歌颂我们的人民。
    人民的冲天干劲和共产主义劳动态度
    我看到了些什么！给我印象最深的是什么！
    首先是人民的冲天干劲和共产主义的劳动态度。国棉十七厂第三季度比去年同季度增产33％，在纺织工业上这是个巨大的增长。为了提高产量，工人创造了许多奇迹，有说不完的故事。如苦战一昼夜猛攻优级纱，五小时消灭接头白点，苦战八昼夜提高车速30％。曾有一个昼夜出现了五个奇迹。在这个大跃进的形势下，厂长、党委书记带头搬到厂里来住，工人也住进厂里来了，有一位修理间的老师傅六天六夜未睡觉。由于生产速度增加，供电不够了，必须增加供电设备，估计要三十六个班的工作量，经过反复讨论，压缩到六个班，结果只用了四个班就安装好了。
    纺织工人生产干劲的推动力首先是农业的大跃进，工人们听到农业的大丰收就哄起来了，一定要和农民比干劲。今年棉花比去年增产一倍，纺织工人就要把这些棉花变成纱布。因此工人们正在争取第四季增产50％，明年要增产100％。
    另一方面，我看到农民的干劲也是惊人的。“七一”人民公社的青年卫星营正在深翻五尺的麦田里施肥，这块麦田明年的亩产指标是十万斤。“七一”人民公社成立后的第一个战役就是深翻地，农民们挑灯夜战，六天深翻了三千五百多亩。有一个生产队搞到早晨三、四点钟还不肯休息，党委书记劝他们也劝不回去，正在这时，另外几个生产队也敲锣打鼓地来支援了。
    目前劳动的特点，一是干劲足，一是共产主义思想高。以前农业生产合作社之间往往不能很好地协作，而现在人民公社各生产队之间互相支援，互相帮助已经形成风气。国棉十七厂黄宝妹在消灭接头白点的竞赛中，首先把技术教给竞赛的对手，让对方小组超过自己的小组，若是没有共产主义思想这是办不到的。劳动人民这种冲天干劲显然不是为了自己，不是为了多得几个工分或工资。他们昼夜苦战，早已把八小时工作制冲破了，干部的工作往往不是鼓动工人们去工作，而是动员他们回去休息。这样的忘我劳动并不是为了报酬，我在国棉十七厂就看到一张大字报，是供销科全体人员写的，他们自动要求取消科室季度奖励制。“黄宝妹”影片从编剧到演员都是厂里的职工，他们谢绝了影片公司的酬劳。从这些事例中我看到了“不拿报酬地为大家工作”的共产主义劳动态度。这是共产主义的风格，这种风格有如高山峻岭，那些帝国主义的矮人和沉溺在资产阶级思想泥坑里的人们对这种风格是无法理解也无法企及的。
    我国生产上的大跃进，劳动人民的冲天干劲，是由于党的正确领导，由于共产主义思想大大发扬，由于他们认识到劳动不是为了自己，而是为了搞社会主义建设，为了在生产上超过最先进的资本主义国家，为了使我国六亿人民吃饭穿衣不要钱，为了让共产主义早日实现。我国全体人民在党的领导下，为了这样一个伟大的目标而自愿地、忘我地劳动着，六亿人民的物质财富和精神面貌在迅速增长着和改变着，这难道不是惊天动地的事情吗？
      劳动人民真正成了国家的主人
    其次，给我印象最深的是劳动人民真正成了主人。他们是国家的主人。国棉十七厂在整风中间，八千多工人贴出了十五万张大字报；建立人民公社时，群众要求搞公社的情绪极高，每个生产队都写了申请书，有的晚上把申请书写好，连夜敲锣打鼓送到社里，回去还开夜工搞生产，提出“搞好生产，迎接入社”的口号。只有在劳动人民感到自己是国家的主人，以主人翁的态度考虑集体利益时，才能出现这种积极性。
    我看到了这样的变化：工人从机器的奴隶变成了机器的主人。黄宝妹倡导的女工修机器的运动最能说明这个问题。历来女工只挡车，机器坏了要等保全工来修理，黄宝妹想要提高工作效率，最好是女工能修理机器。可是保全工不同意，认为女工干不了修机器的工作，于是展开了要不要做机器的主人的辩论，结果女工学会了修机器，随坏随修，因而大大提高工作效率。现在国棉十七厂普遍展开了学习黄宝妹运动，大家做机器的主人。工人做了机器的主人，就更能大胆开展技术革命，更能创造发明机器。国棉十七厂修机间老师傅祝兴发创制了静电纺纱机，可以从棉花直接纺成细纱。据说资本主义国家曾有过这种发明，但资本家认为这项发明不利于他们榨取利润，因此把新发明的机器买来毁掉了。
    和工人做了机器的主人的同时，农民成了土地的主人。农民中流传着一句话：“人有多大胆，地有多大产”，决定收获量的主要因素是人而不是像过去那样单纯靠天、靠土地。我在“七一”人民公社看到的水稻和棉花的丰产情况都是以前不可能想像的。丰产棉田的旁边恰恰好有一块单干户的棉田，农民们说社里的棉花人把高，单干户的棉花尺把高，这是多么鲜明的对比？我看到整个田间是一片动人的景象，田头路旁飘扬着彩旗，农民们歌声嘹亮，无数积肥的熏土窑冒着浓烟，农民们搞深翻、积肥，要让土地翻个身，供给它充足的营养，为的是要明年的农业生产再放卫星，粮食产量再翻一番。过去农民被束缚在土地上听天由命地生活，过去小农经济的保守思想都被破除得几乎不留痕迹了，代替它的是敢想敢做的气概，是指挥土地、驾驭自然的新农民。
    还有，今天劳动人民不但做了生产上的主人，还正在变成文化的主人。国棉十七厂六天消灭了文盲，接着就成立了红专学校，已经有五千多工人入学，他们要在四年内达到纺织专科学校毕业的水平。工人下班后，红专学校就展开政治、文化和技术活动，而这些活动都是和生产紧密结合着的。工厂办起了学校，工人不但要做生产的主人，还要做文化的主人；工厂不但生产物质财富，还要培养共产主义新人。上海刚解放时，黄宝妹还是个文盲，而现在是红专学校第五班的学生，她不但是生产能手，劳动模范，还常常给报纸写文章，她是厂里越剧团的演员，在“黄宝妹”影片中自己演自己，被公认为称得上是一个出色的演员。现在厂里的工人又集体写了一个剧本“三十六班到四班”，写诗的人就更多了，最近围绕着“日日夜夜”这个题目写出了很多诗。
    在“七一”人民公社，扫盲的工作也基本完成了，也成立了红专学校。出现了田头黑板报，田头文艺表演，对生产鼓舞很大。现在准备搞农民的文艺会演，搞全公社的运动大会。我曾在国棉十七厂和“七一”人民公社的食堂里吃过饭，饭食很不坏，而且清洁卫生做得很好。“七一”人民公社第十生产队的食堂在诸陈家宅，这里已经是七无村。吃饭的时候，公社的广播站在播送音乐，接着又报告公社的生产消息。
    劳动人民做了文化的主人，体力劳动者在迅速掌握文化知识，这和我看到的另一个现象——工厂管理人员下车间劳动，机关干部和青年学生下农村、工厂参加体力劳动的事实结合起来，就将逐渐消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。我已经看到既是工人或农民，同时又是诗人、演员、发明家的事实，这说明劳动人民最聪明，而一旦劳动人民掌握了文化知识，就更增加了无穷无尽的力量，就没有什么做不到的事情。
    妇女劳动力得到彻底解放
    再其次，我对妇女的解放也获得了很深的印象。广大妇女已从繁重的家务劳动中解放出来，参加了社会工作和生产劳动。得到了和男子完全平等的地位，有同样参加工作的机会，同工同酬，使妇女的劳动力得到彻底的解放，这是妇女的大翻身。国棉十七厂的工人中有70％是女工，“七一”人民公社三万多劳动力中有二万多是妇女（郊区男子很多在上海工厂里做工），就是这些妇女在劳动中创造了奇迹。尤其在搞起人民公社后更能看到妇女的解放，在成立公社之前，虽然妇女也能参加劳动，但是被家务纠缠住，如要烧饭、管孩子、缝衣、洗衣等，还是不能和男子平等。成立了人民公社后，生活集体化了，有食堂吃饭，有托儿所管孩子，甚至洗衣服也有专人负责，只有在这种情况下，妇女的劳动力才算真正解放出来。
    这次我接触了很多妇女，她们有的是副厂长、党委书记、团委书记、劳动模范、生产队长、工人、农民，她们有老年人也有青年人，在她们身上找不出任何一点过去在男子面前常表现的那种自卑感，她们性格开朗，敢说敢做，干劲冲天。看那些活跃在田间的姑娘们，她们那样矫健，那样生龙活虎，全身放射着劳动的光采，就不能不想到人们的审美观点已经改变了，剥削阶级把纤弱、苗条、多愁善病等认为是美的条件，而在劳动人民看来这是丑，是没落。
    我记起毛主席最近曾说过：“如果每人每年没有一两千斤粮食，没有公共食堂，没有幸福院、托儿所，没有扫除文盲，没有小学、中学、大学，妇女还不可能彻底解放。”我们今天的工作，也只有我们这样的工作，才能真正达到使妇女彻底解放的目标。
      共产主义社会已不是遥远的事情
    总起来说，由于中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导和人民群众的冲天干劲结合起来，就形成了今天大跃进的形势。这是一个生产力大解放的时代，一个思想大解放的时代，一个人和人的关系、人们的精神面貌起着深刻变化的时代，一个出奇迹的时代。在主要的工农业产品的产量方面一年内增加一倍，这是古今中外不可想像的事，而我们正是创造了这样的纪录；广大的人民群众忘我地劳动着，没有人强迫，不计较工作时间，不计较工作条件，不计较报酬，昼夜辛苦而心情舒畅；干部和知识分子参加体力劳动，学校的课堂扩展到车间和田间，工厂的领导干部跟班劳动，和工人同劳动，“劳动”已经从卑贱变成了光荣的事情，“劳动”已经从人们的义务变成了权利：广大的劳动人民要做文化的主人，劳动人民要能文能武，工厂里生产诗，生产电影，生产创造发明，农田里生产黑板报，生产文艺表演，生产农业科学；在我国出现了人民公社，五亿农民的思想不但要搞社会主义，而且要搞共产主义。这一切都是奇迹，同时也都是历史的必然。事实正是如此，文字的形容只会感到不够而绝不会有所夸大，那些帝国主义和反动派的有意歪曲和诬蔑只能显得可怜亦复可笑，浮云是遮不住太阳的！
    我国大跃进的形势是历史的必然，是光荣的中国共产党正确领导的结果。通过整风，党在人民中的威信更空前提高了，党在每次运动中都把群众的思想提到新的高度，群众更加信赖党，更加紧密地团结在党的周围；群众看得更远，干劲也就更大。人民群众今天看到的不但是要迅速建成社会主义社会，而且还看到过渡到共产主义社会也不是多么遥远的事情了。六亿中国人民在中国共产党的领导下团结得像一个人，党指向哪里，人民就奔向哪里，凭着这股力量，我们就能让高山低头，河水让路；能够在不太长的时期内实现丰衣足食，能够在几年之内赶上和超过世界先进资本主义国家的生产水平。凭着这股力量，我们就能对世界和平事业做出巨大的贡献，美帝国主义在台湾海峡制造紧张局势对我们进行疯狂的战争挑衅，只能加速它的灭亡。我国六亿人民在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，正在一方面拉紧绞索，一方面搞生产大跃进，因此我们有充分的力量和信心解放台湾及其他沿海岛屿，有充分的力量和信心最终统一我国全部领土，以维护远东和世界和平。
    这是一个共产主义思想繁荣昌盛的时代，是一个人民当家做主的时代。有了党的领导，人民将摧毁一切陈旧的东西，帝国主义和反动派将像垃圾一样被人民清除掉；人民将建设一个崭新的社会，这是一个多少世代以来人们就梦想着而未曾实现的社会，这是一个消灭了一切不平等，社会产品极为丰富，人们的道德品质极为高尚的“各尽所能，各取所需”的社会，这是一个最终实现永久和平的社会——共产主义社会。
    我们处在这样一个光辉的时代，我们有这样光辉的人民。让我们用最美的声音歌颂我们的人民吧，让我们推动这个时代向着更加光辉灿烂的明天飞驶前进吧！（文内标题是本报编者加的）（附图片）
