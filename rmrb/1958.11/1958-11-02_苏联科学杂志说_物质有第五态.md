    Soviet Science Magazine Says
    Matter Has a Fifth State
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In addition to the commonly known states of matter—solid, liquid, gas, and the more recently understood plasma gas—there exists a fifth state: "super-solid state." This was stated in an article published in the latest issue of the Soviet magazine "Young Technology."

    The article says that the fifth state is the result of solids being subjected to ultra-high pressure, and its primary characteristic is that matter in this state loses all chemical reactivity. The article points out that this state of matter may exist in the Earth's core, that is, at depths below 2,900 kilometers.

    As we all know, the smallest unit of a chemical element is an atom. At the center of an atom is a nucleus, surrounded by several electron shells, each containing a certain number of electrons. The number of electrons in the outermost electron shell plays a very important role in the chemical properties of the element. By using some method to change the number of electrons in the outermost electron shell, the chemical properties of the element can be altered to some extent.

    The article says that the chemical "degeneration" of ordinary elements may occur under pressures of 50,000 to 120,000 atmospheres. With a further significant increase in pressure, the nuclei of the atoms of matter will fuse into the electrons, and the particles that make up the atoms will gather in an extremely small volume at ultra-high density, at which point the chemical properties of the matter will completely disappear. This state is the fifth state of matter.

### 苏联科学杂志说  物质有第五态

    苏联科学杂志说
    物质有第五态
    据新华社讯　物质形态除大家常见的固体、液体、气体和最近开始被了解的等离子气体外，还存在着第五态——“超固态”，这是苏联“青年技术”杂志最近一期发表的一篇文章中说的。
    文章说，第五态是固体受到超高压作用的结果，其首要特点是这种形态的物质丧失了一切化学作用性能。文章指出，在地球的核心，即在深度在二千九百公里以下的地方，是可能存在这种物质形态的。
    像大家所知道的，化学元素的最小单位是原子。原子中心是一个原子核，而外面有若干层电子层，每层电子层又有一定数目的电子。最外层电子层的数目对元素的化学性质有很重要的作用。利用某种方法改变最外层电子层电子数目，就可以使元素化学性质起某种变化。
    文章说，一般元素在五万到十二万大气压的压力下都可能发生这种化学性的“退化”。在压力进一步大大增加的情况下，物质的原子核就会融在电子之中，组成原子的粒子将以超高密度聚集在极小的体积中，这时物质的化学性就会完全消失。这种形态就是物质的第五态。
