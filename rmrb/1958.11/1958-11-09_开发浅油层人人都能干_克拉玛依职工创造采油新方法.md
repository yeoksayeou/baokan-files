    Developing Shallow Oil Layers Can Be Done By Anyone
    Karamay Workers Create New Oil Extraction Method

    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Karamay, November 8th) Workers in the Karamay mining area have created a set of methods for developing shallow oil layers that are simple in equipment, easy to operate, and inexpensive, from drilling and oil extraction to oil transportation and crude oil refining. The Petroleum Industry Ministry's on-site conference in Karamay believes that this is a good way for our whole nation to run the petroleum industry.

    The shallow oil layer oilfields in the Karamay area cover an area of over 200 square kilometers. In the past, it was believed that the development of any oilfield required large-scale machinery and a large amount of steel. It would be uneconomical to mine low-yield oilfields in this way. Under the guidance of this thinking, large areas of shallow oil layer oilfields in Karamay have always been regarded as having no industrial value. After the Ministry of Petroleum Industry put forward the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and having the whole nation run the petroleum industry this year, the Karamay workers, through exploration, found a development method suitable for the specific conditions of these oilfields. This method is: In terms of drilling, they use light and small drilling rigs, self-made simple derricks, and small drill bits to drill small-bore wells. No steel casing or tubing is lowered into the well, and the wellhead device is simple. Using this method and equipment, each drilling rig can drill more than ten 200-300 meter deep oil wells per month, and the cost per meter is only one-tenth of the cost of drilling with foreign methods. In terms of oil extraction methods, they have created a set of light and simple pumping equipment that uses only a small amount of steel: The oil transmission pipelines, oil storage equipment, and winter insulation equipment on the oilfields all use simple indigenous methods instead. This method is to build automatic oil transmission culverts connecting the various oil wells on the oilfield with bricks and adobe, replacing steel oil transmission pipelines. The cost of extracting each ton of crude oil using this method and equipment is only eight to ten yuan. In terms of oil refining methods, Karamay has also successfully experimented with using simple equipment to dry distill oil sand. Using this method, 8% of petroleum can be extracted from solid oil sand outcropping on the ground.

    The technology created by Karamay workers for developing shallow oil layer oilfields is simple, and ordinary farmers and housewives can master it in a short period of time. Wherever there are shallow oil layers, as long as one or two drilling rigs and some auxiliary equipment are purchased, a petroleum joint enterprise with drilling, oil extraction, and refining of gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and other products can be built in a very short time.

    Our country is rich in shallow oil layer resources. After this set of methods for developing shallow oil layer oilfields is found, shallow oil layer oilfields that were previously considered to have no industrial value will provide the country with a large amount of crude oil.

    开发浅油层人人都能干
    克拉玛依职工创造采油新方法
    本报克拉玛依8日电　克拉玛依矿区职工创造了一套开发浅油层的方法，从钻井、采油、输油到炼制原油，设备简单，操作容易，成本便宜。石油工业部克拉玛依现场会议认为这是我国全民办石油的好途径。
    克拉玛依地区浅油层油田面积约二百多平方公里。过去，认为开发任何油田都需要大型机械设备、大量钢材。要这样来开采产量不高的油田，很不合算。在这种思想指导下，克拉玛依大片浅油层油田一直被看作没有工业价值。石油工业部今年提出土洋并举、全民办石油工业的方针后，经克拉玛依职工摸索，找到了适合这种油田具体条件的开发方法。这种方法是：在钻井方面，他们采用轻便的小钻机、自制成简单的井架，用小钻头打小眼井，井内不下钢质套管和油管，井口装置简单井口装置。用这种方法和设备，每月每部钻机能打十多口二三百公尺深的油井，每公尺的成本只相当于洋办法打井成本的十分之一。在采油方法上，他们创造了一套只用少量钢材，轻便简单的抽油设备：油田上的输油管线，储油设备和冬季保温设备，都采用了简单的土办法来代替。这种办法是用砖和土坯在油田上建成连结各个油井的自动输油暗渠，代替了钢质输油管线。用这种方法和设备采出的每吨原油，成本只八到十元。在炼油方法上，克拉玛依还试验成功了用简单设备干馏油砂。用这种办法从露头到地面上的固体油砂中可提炼出8％的石油。
    克拉玛依职工创造的开发浅油层油田的技术简单，一般农民和家庭妇女都能在短期内掌握。凡是有浅油层的地方，只要购置一部到二部钻机和一些附属设备，就能在很短时间内建成一座有钻井、采油和炼制汽油、柴油、煤油等产品的石油联合企业。
    我国浅油层资源丰富，这一套开发浅油层油田的方法找到后，过去被看作没有工业价值的浅油层油田，将为国家提供出大量原油。
