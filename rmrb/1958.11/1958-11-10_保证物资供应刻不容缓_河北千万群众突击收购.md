    Ensuring Supply of Materials is of Utmost Importance
    Hebei's Millions Launch a Rush to Purchase

    (Reported by this newspaper) Hebei Province, under the premise of ensuring the vigorous development of steel production and industrial and agricultural production, combined with cotton picking and sweet potato storage, launched a massive mass movement of large-scale purchasing and sales in the province in late October, resulting in an all-round leap forward in agricultural product procurement, transportation, and financial and trade work.

    After the issuance of the emergency instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on rushing to complete the task of agricultural product purchase and transportation, the movement in Hebei Province immediately unfolded with the force of a storm. On October 23, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee convened the fifth telephone conference of various special districts and cities, calling on the province to launch an all-out campaign by the whole party and all the people, and put forward the battle slogan of "Fighting for seven days, launching satellites!" The special districts immediately studied measures overnight, formulated satellite standards, and immediately deployed them to the counties; the counties immediately organized forces, convened emergency meetings, and on the 24th, all were implemented to the townships and communes. A mass movement, rapid in action and magnificent in scale, was launched vigorously.

    This battle focused on the purchase and transportation of cotton and grain, and the harvesting of sweet potatoes. At the same time, it drove the purchase of other agricultural, sideline, and local specialty products and the supply of materials, and also drove fiscal revenue and bank collection of loans and deposits. The number of people involved in the movement was estimated at over ten million. After the battles in late October, fruitful results were obtained. According to statistics on the 30th (of which cotton purchase statistics were as of the 28th), autumn grain in storage reached 2.22 billion jin; more than 19 million mu of sweet potatoes had been harvested, and 567,666,000 jin of seed cotton had been collected (converted to ginned cotton). Fifty-four counties in the province have completed the annual task of pure grain storage; sixteen counties have completed the original annual cotton purchase plan; and more than ten counties have completed the live pig purchase task. The province's material supply has also made great progress, not only ensuring the materials needed by the steel army, but also storing some major necessities of life. At the same time, industrial and commercial tax revenue, corporate profits, loan recovery, and urban savings have all increased significantly.

    During this stage of the large-scale purchasing and sales movement, the Hebei Province was led and directed by the Party secretaries of the counties and townships, who were assigned to take command and coordinate the work. The province organized approximately 50,000 cadres from the financial and trade system, who, under the leadership of the Party committees, divided up battle zones and were responsible under contract. In order to promote this work, a large-scale airing of views, contending, and debate was launched among cadres and employees of the financial and trade system on "Doing a good job in large-scale purchasing and sales to achieve five satisfactions" (the five satisfactions are: the state is satisfied, the people's communes are satisfied, the masses are satisfied, all departments are satisfied, and financial and trade employees are satisfied) and "Can we achieve victory in advance in completing the purchasing and sales tasks given the short time, tight labor, and large tasks?" This cleared away conservative thinking and boosted enthusiasm. In terms of tapping labor potential, many areas mobilized the masses, using detailed accounting and searching everywhere to mobilize men and women, old and young, to organize combat corps and specialized teams to carry out large and small-scale blitz battles. According to preliminary statistics, from the 21st to the 30th, the province launched 518 satellites of various standards, mainly focused on grain and cotton purchases. In the large-scale purchasing and sales, there was great cooperation between workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers.

    Currently, Hebei Province is building upon the initial victories already achieved and pushing the large-scale purchasing and sales movement to a higher peak. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee have issued a call at the telephone conference on October 31: In November, under the premise of ensuring steel production and doing a good job in agricultural production, launch a decisive battle to complete the task of purchasing agricultural and sideline products.

    保证物资供应刻不容缓
    河北千万群众突击收购
    本报讯　河北省在保证大搞钢铁生产和工农业生产的前提下结合着棉花收摘和甘薯收藏，10月下旬在全省掀起了声势浩大的大购大销的群众运动，使农产品收购调运和财贸工作获得全面的跃进。
    中共中央和国务院关于突击完成农产品收购调运任务的紧急指示发表以后，河北省的运动立即以急风骤雨之势展开。10月23日，中共河北省委员会和河北省人民委员会召开了各专、市的第五次电话会议，号召全省展开全党全民大突击，提出了“鏖战七天，大放卫星”的战斗口号。各专区紧接着连夜研究措施，制定卫星标准，立即布置到县；各县马上组织力量，召开紧急会议，24日全部贯彻到乡和公社，一个行动迅速、规模壮阔的群众运动就轰轰烈烈地搞起来了。
    这个战斗以棉花、粮食的收购、调运和甘薯的收刨作为主攻目标，同时带动了其他农副土特产品的收购和物资供应，也带动了财政收入和银行收贷与存款。投入运动的群众约计千万人以上。经过10月下旬的鏖战，获得了丰硕的战果。根据30日的统计（其中棉花收购的统计是截至28日），秋粮入库已达二十二亿二千万斤；甘薯已收刨一千九百多万亩，已收籽棉折皮棉五亿六千七百六十六万斤。全省已有五十四个县完成全年纯粮入库任务；有十六个县完成原定的全年棉花收购计划；还有十多个县完成了生猪收购任务。全省物资供应也有了很大进展，不但保证了钢铁大军所需要的物资，而且还储备了一些主要生活必需品。同时，工商税收、企业利润、收回贷款、城市储蓄都有很大的增长。
    这一阶段的大购大销运动中，河北省由各县、乡党委书记分工挂帅、指挥作战，加强了党的领导，统筹安排各项工作。全省组织了约五万名财贸系统的干部，在党委领导下，划分战区，包干负责。为了推动这一工作，在财贸系统干部和职工中展开了关于“做好大购大销实现五满意”（五满意是：国家满意、人民公社满意、群众满意、各部门满意、财贸职工满意）和“时间短、劳力紧、任务大，能否提前胜利完成购销任务”的大鸣大放大辩论，扫除保守思想，鼓舞了干劲。在挖掘劳动潜力方面，许多地区发动群众，通过算细账、到处找的办法，动员男女老少，组织战斗兵团和专业队伍，开展大大小小的突击战。据初步统计，从21日到30日，全省共放射出各种标准不同的、以粮棉收购为主的卫星五百一十八颗。在大购大销中出现了工农商学兵的大协作。
    目前，河北省正在已经获得初步胜利的基础上，把大购大销运动推向更高峰。中共河北省委员会和河北省人民委员会在10月31日的电话会议上已发出号召：11月份在保证钢铁生产和搞好农业生产的前提下，开展决胜战，完成农副产品收购任务。
