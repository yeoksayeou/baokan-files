Steel Red People Get Redder

    He Didn't Leave His Name
    At one o'clock in the morning, the production headquarters concluded the meeting for deploying the third battle. In order to promptly implement the spirit of the meeting, several comrades from the Communist Party of Leping County Committee had to rush fifty *li* that night to the iron smelting base – Yanqian – to hold a meeting.
    The sky had no moon, the night was pitch black, and drizzle continued to fall. The road was so muddy and difficult to travel, and it would take until dawn to walk more than fifty *li*. If only there was a car! But in Zhushanping, the iron smelting base, where would a car come from! The few people had no choice but to walk.
    After walking about eight *li*, at the entrance of Tongling Street Village, they saw an open-top car parked by the road. It seemed the driver was already resting. Let's borrow this car! They all thought this. But would the driver agree in the middle of the night? After hesitating for a while, the urgent task and short time forced them to rashly knock on the door behind the car.
    The door opened with a "creak," and a person wearing clothes quickly stepped out and asked, "What's the matter?" They explained that they had to go to Yanqian for an emergency meeting. Before they could finish, the person hurriedly said, "Please get in the car quickly!" It turned out that this person was the driver.
    About an hour later, the car arrived at its destination. Everyone happily jumped out of the car and thanked the driver with admiration, "Comrade Driver, you are too kind. Without your help, we don't know when we would have arrived! Thank you." The driver said modestly, "This is nothing. Producing steel is also my responsibility." After saying that, he reached out to say goodbye to his passengers one by one. At this time, they remembered to ask, "Comrade, what is your name?" The driver replied, "Don't be polite, it's nothing! Your task is important, goodbye!" He waved his hand and stepped into the car. People stood there blankly, watching the speeding car and the person who did not leave his name, until it was out of sight, before heading towards the construction site. (Attached picture)

    他没有留下姓名
    深夜一点，生产指挥部布置第三次战斗的会议结束了。为了把会议精神及时贯彻下去，中共乐平县委的几个同志，要连夜赶五十里路，到炼铁基地——岩前去开会。
    天空没有月亮，夜是一团漆黑，牛毛细雨还在不停的下着。道路是那么泥泞难走，要走五十多里地，得走到天亮，要是有辆汽车多好啊！可是在炼铁基地的朱山坪，哪来的汽车呢！几个人只好走着去。
    大约走了八里来路，在童陵街村头，看到一辆敞篷汽车停在公路旁，看样子司机已经休息了。借这辆汽车去吧！大家都这样想。可是，深更半夜的，司机会同意吗？犹疑了一阵，最后，急迫的任务，短促的时间，使他们不得不冒冒失失地去敲响了汽车后边的那家大门。
    门“呀”的一声开了，一个披着衣服的人，刚跨出门槛就问：“有什么事么？”他们把要去岩前开紧急会议的事情说了一遍，还没等说完，那个人就连忙说：“请快上车吧！”原来这个人就是司机。
    一小时左右，汽车到达了目的地，大家愉快地跳下车来，带着敬佩的心情向司机道谢：“司机同志，你太好了，没有你的帮助，我们不知道什么时候才能到呢！谢谢你。”司机很谦虚地说：“这点事算什么，生产钢铁也有我的份。”说完伸出手来向他的乘客一一道别。这时，他们才想起问：“同志，你贵姓？”司机却回答：“不要客气，这没什么！你们的任务重，再见吧！”他把手一挥，就跨进了车厢。人们呆呆的站着，望着那辆奔驰的汽车和那没有留下姓名的人，直到看不见了，才向工地走去。（附图片）
