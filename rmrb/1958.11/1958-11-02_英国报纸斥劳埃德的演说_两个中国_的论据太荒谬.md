Xinhua News Agency, London, October 31st: The "Scotsman" commented on British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's speech in the House of Commons yesterday in an editorial today, saying: "Maintaining an alliance does not require openly accepting Mr. Dulles' most erroneous arguments, which are not even universally accepted in the United States." Addressing Lloyd's absurd argument about the so-called "dispute between two Chinas," the newspaper emphasized that "Although there are two Koreas, two Vietnams, and two Germanys, there is only one China, which is opposed by the former Chinese government supported by the United States on the issue of its coastal islands."

    英国报纸斥劳埃德的演说
    “两个中国”的论据太荒谬
    据新华社伦敦31日电　“苏格兰人报”今天在社论中评论英国外交大臣劳埃德昨天在下院发表的演说时说：“要维持联盟并不需要公开接受杜勒斯先生最谬误的论据，这种论据甚至在美国也不是普遍为人所接受的”。报纸针对劳埃德所谓“两个中国之间的争执”的谬论强调说，“虽然有两个朝鲜、两个越南和两个德国，但是中国只有一个，它在属于它的沿海岛屿（的问题）上，受到为美国所支持的中国前政府的反对。”
