Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 28th: Abundant natural gas has been discovered beneath the surface of Shanghai's urban area and the surrounding ten-plus counties of Pudong, Jiading, Nanhui, and Chuansha.

According to investigations and preliminary drilling by relevant departments, the natural gas is widely distributed, covering an area of approximately 5,000 square kilometers. The gas contains unsaturated hydrocarbons, and the deeper the gas layer, the greater the gas production. These findings indicate that the natural gas beneath Shanghai originates from deep underground strata and is not the marsh gas commonly found in riverbed sludge. The formation of this natural gas is believed to be related to the possible presence of oil underground. Some places can extract several cubic meters of gas per day from a single well, which can be used to manufacture chemicals; other places have smaller gas reserves that can be extracted for lighting and cooking.

In the past month or two, a mass movement to extract natural gas, "mainly using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign techniques," has been launched in all districts and counties of Shanghai. Many factories, government agencies, schools, shops, neighborhood committees, military units, and people's communes have extracted natural gas. According to incomplete statistics, at least 1,000 wells have been drilled throughout the city, and the extracted natural gas has been widely used for lighting, cooking, power generation, steelmaking, and the production of chemical raw materials.

Shanghai consumes approximately one million tons of coal annually for cooking and heating. If one-third of the canteens and households used natural gas, hundreds of thousands of tons of coal could be saved each year. To further tap into Shanghai's underground treasure—natural gas—and enable more people to master gas extraction techniques, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee organized relevant departments to establish an office for the promotion and utilization of natural gas, to uniformly lead the city's natural gas extraction and promotion efforts. Since the end of last month, a natural gas training class of nearly 400 people has been held, training a group of key personnel in the extraction and utilization of natural gas.

    上海地下天然气丰富
    据新华社上海28日电　上海市区和附近浦东、嘉定、南汇、川沙等十多县的地层下面，到处发现丰富的天然气。
    据有关部门调查和初步钻探证明，天然气分布范围很广，约五千平方公里，气体含有不饱和碳氢化合物，气层越在地下深处出气量越大。这些情况证明上海地底下蕴藏的是来自地层深处的天然气，并非河底污泥中习见的沼气，这种天然气的形成估计与地下可能有石油有关。有的地方打一口井一天能采气几立方公尺，可以用来制造化学品；有的地方贮气量较小，可以采来点灯、烧饭。
    最近一两个月来一个以“土法为主，土洋结合”的群众性开采天然气运动，已经在上海全市各区、各县开展起来。许多工厂、机关、学校、商店、里弄、部队和人民公社都开采到了天然气。据不完全统计，全市打井至少在一千口以上，开采出来的天然气已普遍地用来点灯、烧饭、发电、炼钢和制造化工原料。
    上海市每年用来烧饭取暖的煤约一百万吨，如果有三分之一的食堂和家庭用天然气，一年就能节约煤数十万吨。为了进一步挖掘上海地底下的宝藏——天然气，使更多的群众能够掌握采气的技术，中共上海市委和上海市人民委员会组织有关部门，成立了推广利用天然气办公室，统一领导全市天然气的开采、推广利用工作。上月底起举办了一个近四百人的天然气训练班，培训出一批开采和利用天然气的骨干。
