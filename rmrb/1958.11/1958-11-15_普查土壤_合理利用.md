Soil Census for Rational Utilization
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out in its instructions on deep plowing and soil improvement that the "soil" is the center of the formula "water, fertilizer, soil, seed, and close planting." The development of agricultural production increasingly requires people to master systematic knowledge about soil. To effectively improve soil, a soil census must be conducted. To achieve high yields, land must be used rationally. After the people's communes are established, land use plans need to be formulated based on the requirements of large-scale high yields and accelerated development of diversified economies, and land use plans must be based on a comprehensive soil census.
    The high-yield experience in various regions proves that only by understanding the details of the soil can deep plowing targets be set according to the depth of the soil layer; can fertilizer be applied rationally by distinguishing between fertile and infertile soils; can land be leveled to turn slopes into terraced fields; can low-yield fields be transformed into high-yield fields, and high-yield fields made even more productive. Therefore, it is necessary to launch a mass soil census movement nationwide this winter and next spring in conjunction with deep plowing and soil improvement.
    The first problem encountered in carrying out a mass soil census movement is: Who should be relied upon to do this scientific work? In the past, the soil census was conducted by a small number of technical cadres forming a special work team, which was the so-called method of "cadres doing the work, and the masses watching." Relying on a small number of technical cadres to conduct the soil census may take three to five years, or even eight to ten years, to complete. Even if it is completed, it will not be related to the vast number of farmers who directly use the land, and farmers will find it difficult to fully utilize the results of the soil census. The problem is very clear. China's land is so vast that to carry out a nationwide soil census, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, give the technology to the farmers, and let them measure and test the soil themselves, in order to meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Farmers are most familiar with their own land. If they are also given some soil science knowledge and technology, they will definitely be able to correctly identify the local soil. Guangdong Province was able to complete a large-scale soil census in a short period of time because it fully mobilized the masses and gave full play to the power of the masses.
    What method should be used to conduct the soil census? Since this scientific work must mainly rely on the farmers themselves, the method of "soil as the main focus, combining indigenous and foreign methods" must be adopted. There are both indigenous methods and foreign methods; both indigenous terms and foreign terms. In the course of this work, technology and the masses must be combined everywhere, with technical talents from the masses as the mainstay, so that indigenous experts and technical personnel from scientific departments can give full play to their strengths and jointly do a good job in the soil census.
    The soil census must be closely integrated with production and serve current production as much as possible. The soil map drawn through the soil census should be a battle command map for agricultural production.
    It must also be recognized that people cannot thoroughly grasp all the conditions of the soil through one soil census, and land improvement cannot be accomplished "in one battle." Therefore, a policy of "side production, side improvement, continuous improvement, and long-term improvement" must be adopted. Soil improvement cannot be carried out in isolation, but must be carried out in a planned manner in conjunction with irrigation and the promotion of improved varieties, close planting, and field management. Therefore, the tendency to engage in soil census in isolation from production must be prevented. The soil census in Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, is closely integrated with current production practices, and therefore has achieved great results. More than ten acres of rice seedlings in Xinli Fifth Commune of this county turned red. After the soil census, it was found that the soil acidity was too high, so lime was applied in time, and the seedlings quickly turned green. The commune members were very satisfied and said: "This method is really good, it can turn red seedlings green." It can be seen that the soil census can only be truly supported by the masses when it is combined with current production.
    The soil census should be tailored to local conditions, and different regions should have different requirements. That is to say, specific surveys should be conducted according to the different conditions of paddy fields, dry land, irrigated land, mountainous land, and sea mud. Guangdong and Jiangxi proposed ten surveys for paddy fields, Guangxi proposed eight surveys, and Zhejiang proposed eight surveys for paddy fields and dry land, six surveys for barren mountains, and seven surveys for sea mud. These requirements are formulated according to the specific conditions of the local area. This approach of adapting to local conditions is good.
    The soil census work has started at different times and progresses at different speeds in different regions. All regions where the census work has been basically completed should make further efforts to complete the census and apply the results of the census to production practice. Regions where the census work has already started should actively learn from the experience of other regions to ensure the completion of the task. Regions where this work has not yet started should make preparations and quickly start work to catch up.
    In order to ensure the smooth development of this work, politics must take command, and the secretaries of the Party committees must take action. At the beginning of the work, the masses should be fully mobilized, and discussions and debates should be organized to break down superstitions and break the mysterious concept of soil science, so that the masses dare to do it boldly. In this work, the forces of scientific departments and agricultural departments should also be organized to jointly form a soil census coordination committee to unify leadership and unify the allocation of forces.
    At present, various regions are starting a large-scale high-yield movement, and the broad masses have an urgent need to improve the soil. Under such circumstances, soil work must closely follow up. All regions must arrange soil census work into the current work agenda, and strive to complete this meaningful work nationwide this winter and next spring.

    普查土壤　合理利用
    本报评论员
    中共中央关于深耕和改良土壤的指示中曾经指出：“水肥土种密”的中心是土。农业生产的发展，越来越要求人们掌握关于土壤的系统知识。要有效地改良土壤，必须进行土壤普查。要获得高额丰产，必须合理地利用土地。在人民公社化以后，需要根据大面积高额丰产和加速发展多种经济的要求制定土地利用规划，而土地利用规划必须以全面的土壤普查为基础。
    各地的高额丰产经验证明，只有摸清了田土的底细，才能按土层深浅，订出深耕指标；才能区别土壤肥瘦，合理施肥；才能平整土地，把坡地变梯田；才能变低产田为高产田，让高产田更高产。因此，今冬明春在全国范围内结合深耕、改良土壤，开展一个群众性的土壤普查运动，是十分必要的。
    开展群众性的土壤普查运动，首先碰到的问题是：依靠谁来做这项科学工作？过去是依靠少数技术干部组成专门的工作队来做土壤普查工作，就是所谓“干部作，群众看”的办法。依靠少数技术干部来搞土壤普查，三、五年甚至十年八年也不一定搞得完，即使搞完了，也与直接利用土地的广大农民不发生关系，农民很难充分利用这份土壤普查的成果。问题很明显，我国土地这么大，要搞全国范围内的土壤普查工作，只有充分发动群众，把技术交给农民，让他们自己来做土壤的测量和化验，才能达到多快好省的要求。农民对自己的土地最熟悉，如果再告诉他们一些土壤科学知识和技术，他们一定能够正确地鉴定本地的土壤。广东省所以能在短期内完成了大面积的土壤普查，就是因为充分发动了群众，充分发挥了群众的力量。
    用什么方法来搞土壤普查呢？既然这项科学工作必须主要依靠农民群众自己来做，那么就必须采用以土为主，土洋结合的方法。既有土办法，也有洋办法；既用土名词，也用洋名词。在这项工作过程中，必须处处使技术和群众相结合，以群众中的技术人材为主，使土专家和科学部门的技术人员各尽所长，共同做好土壤普查工作。
    土壤普查工作必须与生产密切结合，尽量为当前的生产服务。通过土壤普查所绘制的土壤图，应当是一幅农业生产上的作战指挥图。
    还要看到，人们不可能经过一次土壤普查，彻底掌握土壤的全部情况，同时土地改良也不可能“毕其功于一役”。因此必须采取边生产、边改良、不断改良，长期改良的方针。土壤改良也不能孤立地进行，必须结合灌溉和推广良种、密植、田间管理等措施有计划地进行。因此，对于脱离生产、孤立地搞土壤普查的偏向必须加以防止。四川省南部县的土壤普查和当前的生产实践结合得密切，因此收效很大。这个县的新立五社有十多亩秧苗发红，经过土壤普查，知道是因为土壤酸度过大，于是及时追施了石灰，使秧苗很快转青。社员十分满意地说：“这办法真好，能使红秧转青。”可见土壤普查只有结合了当前生产，才能真正得到群众的支持。
    土壤普查工作要因地制宜，不同地区要有不同的要求。这就是说，要分别水田、旱地、水浇地、山地、海淤等不同田地的情况进行具体查勘。广东、江西提出水田十查，广西提出八查，浙江提出水田、旱地八查、荒山六查、海淤七查等。这些要求都是根据当地具体情况拟定的。这种因地制宜的做法是好的。
    各地进行土壤普查工作有早有晚，进度不同。凡是普查工作基本完成的地区，应该进一步努力，全部完成普查，并将普查的成果运用到生产实践中去。普查工作已经开展的地区，应该积极学习其他地区的经验，保证完成任务。尚未开展这项工作的地区，应当做好准备，迅速开展工作，迎头赶上去。
    为了保证这项工作的顺利开展，必须政治挂帅，书记动手。工作一开始，就应当充分发动群众，组织鸣放辩论，破除迷信，打破对于土壤科学神秘的观念，使群众大胆去干。在这项工作中还要组织科学部门、农业部门的力量，共同组成土壤普查协作委员会，统一领导，统一调配力量。
    目前，各地正在动手开展大面积高额丰产运动，广大群众对改良土壤有迫切要求，在这样情况下，土壤工作必须紧紧跟上去。各地一定要把土壤普查工作安排到当前的工作日程上去，力争在今冬明春在全国范围内完成这项有意义的工作。
