Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch: Tokyo News: The Japanese Socialist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party held their fourth four-person meeting today in an attempt to salvage the current chaotic political situation in Japan. Representatives of the two parties engaged in fierce debate at the meeting, but without result. The two sides decided to hold a fifth meeting tomorrow. The current chaotic political situation in Japan is due to the Liberal Democratic Party's illegal extension of the Diet's extraordinary session and its attempt to forcibly pass the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment."

According to Kyodo News, Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Masajiro Kawashima and General Council Chairman Ichiro Kono, ignoring the opposition of Socialist Party representatives, insisted on treating the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment," which has been strongly opposed by the Japanese people, as a bill for continued deliberation in the Diet, attempting to force its passage at the next Diet session.

After the end of this meeting, the Socialist Party held a meeting of its chairman and bureau chiefs. The meeting held that the Liberal Democratic Party's approach was a manifestation of a complete lack of reflection and sincerity, and once again affirmed the Socialist Party's attitude of absolutely not agreeing to "continued deliberation" of this amendment. The Socialist Party believes that in today's situation where the government and the Liberal Democratic Party's approach to proposing this amendment and the unilateral and sudden extension of the Diet session have been condemned by public opinion, it is common sense to treat this amendment as an unfinished or abandoned bill.

The Socialist Party also believes that the time is not yet ripe for holding a meeting of the leaders of the two parties. In addition, the Socialist Party is preparing to respond to the Liberal Democratic Party's consistent refusal to compromise on the issue of breaking the deadlock in the four-person meeting, and will hold a meeting of the secretariat of the National Conference Against the Evil Revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" on November 20 to discuss joint action, in order to further intensify the struggle against the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment" in the future.

According to Kyodo News, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet meeting held on the 18th had already decided to convene the 31st ordinary session of the Diet on December 10. Although the Liberal Democratic Party used illegal means to extend the extraordinary session of the Diet by a month from November 7, due to the resistance of the Socialist Party, the various deliberation works of the Diet have not been able to be held. Nobusuke Kishi clearly still wants to achieve in the ordinary session of the Diet what he failed to achieve in the extraordinary session.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch: Tokyo News: With the struggle of the Japanese people against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" becoming increasingly fierce, the internal struggle of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is becoming increasingly overt, and Nobusuke Kishi is facing a crisis of widespread betrayal and isolation.

Kyodo News, in reporting on the situation of open and covert struggles within the Liberal Democratic Party, said that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party suffered a major setback due to the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment," and the meetings held between the Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialist Party to salvage the political situation have made no progress. It pointed out that if the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment" becomes an abandoned bill and the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives resign to take responsibility, then the activities within the Liberal Democratic Party to investigate the responsibility of the Nobusuke Kishi government and the leadership of the ruling party will definitely become overt, and the shaking of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet is inevitable.

According to Kyodo News, the "anti-mainstream faction" within the Liberal Democratic Party is vigorously undermining the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and they want to establish a cooperative system between the "anti-mainstream faction's" Hayato Ikeda faction, the Takeo Miki - Kenzo Matsumura faction, and the Kijiro Ishii faction to completely change the "foundational relationship" of the "Nobusuke Kishi system."

To this end, Koki Kaya, who served as Minister of Finance in the Konoe and Tojo cabinets, held consecutive talks with Nobusuke Kishi, Shigeru Yoshida, and Kijiro Ishii, etc. on November 10 and 11, and news of a cabinet reshuffle is constantly circulating in Japanese political circles. According to Kyodo News, Kaya's activities were coordinated with the current Minister of Finance, Eisaku Sato, in advance. Sato is Nobusuke Kishi's younger brother.

Kyodo News said that at the same time, Nobusuke Kishi's confidants are also "starting to seriously consider the issue of rebuilding the party's internal system after salvaging the abnormal situation." Nobusuke Kishi's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Munenori Akagi, once publicly said that "ways to fundamentally rebuild the Nobusuke Kishi system, such as cabinet reshuffle, will be studied." Akagi's remarks were to cater to the demands of the "anti-mainstream faction" within the party for a cabinet reshuffle, and on the other hand, they also exposed Nobusuke Kishi's intention to take the opportunity to strengthen his ruling position when he is forced to reshuffle the cabinet. According to Kyodo News, therefore, "mainstream faction" leaders criticized Akagi's remarks as "rash." Moreover, from then on, "cabinet reshuffle" has become a taboo subject for the Nobusuke Kishi government and Liberal Democratic Party leaders. Nobusuke Kishi also went around wooing influential figures within the party to help him smooth things over. Former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida came out to help Nobusuke Kishi, saying, "When Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi is salvaging the situation, one should not hold him back or take advantage of the situation. Now is the time to establish party morality."

According to Kyodo News, the "anti-mainstream faction" has not abandoned such intentions: "The issue of who should bear the political responsibility arising from the failure of the Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment will be investigated after salvaging the situation in order to 'establish party morality.'"

Currently, Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Masajiro Kawashima and others are attempting to prevent "cabinet reshuffle work that may cause party disputes," but Kyodo News pointed out: "Whether the current government and the ruling party's system, which has already begun to disintegrate, can cope with the political situation in the future is a big question."

### 日本两党第四次会谈经激烈争论后未获结果  社会党继续拒绝审议警官法修正案  自由民主党内部斗争趋于表面化岸信介处境日益困难

    日本两党第四次会谈经激烈争论后未获结果
    社会党继续拒绝审议警官法修正案
    自由民主党内部斗争趋于表面化岸信介处境日益困难
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本社会党和自由民主党为了收拾目前日本混乱政局，今天举行了第四次四人会谈。两党代表在会上展开了激烈的争论，但是没有结果。双方决定在明天举行第五次会谈。目前日本的混乱政局是由于自由民主党非法延长国会临时会议会期和企图强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”而产生的。
    据共同社报道，自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎和总务会会长河野一郎在会上不顾社会党代表的反对，坚持要把遭到日本人民强烈反对的“警察官职务执行法修正案”作为国会继续审议的法案来处理，企图继续强使下次国会会议加以通过。
    在这次会谈结束以后，社会党举行了委员长和局长会议，会议认为，自由民主党的这种做法，是完全不进行反省和完全没有诚意的表现，并且再一次肯定了社会党绝对不能同意“继续审议”这项修正案的态度。社会党认为，在政府和自由民主党提出这项修正案的做法和单方面突然延长国会会期的措施遭到舆论谴责的今天，应当把这项修正案作为审议未完的议案或者废案来处理，这是一种常识。
    社会党还认为，目前还不到举行两党领袖会谈的时候。另外，社会党准备应付自由民主党在四人会谈中对打开局面问题始终不表示让步的情况，将在11月20日举行反对恶劣修改“警察官职务执行法”国民会议干事会会议，讨论采取联合行动问题，以便在今后进一步加紧展开反对“警察官职务执行法修正案”的斗争。
    另据共同社报道，在18日举行的岸信介内阁会议已经决定在12月10日召开第三十一次国会平时会议。自由民主党虽然用非法手段把国会临时会议的会期从11月7日延长了一个月，但是，由于社会党的抵制，国会的各项审议工作一直没有能够举行。岸信介显然还想在国会平时会议上达到他在临时会议上所未能达到的目的。
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：在日本人民反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争日益激烈的情况下，执政的自由民主党内部的斗争日趋表面化，岸信介面临众叛亲离的危机。
    共同社在报道自由民主党内部明争暗斗的局面时说，岸信介政府和自由民主党由于“警察官职务执行法修正案”栽了一个大跟斗，为了收拾政局而举行的自由民主党和社会党的会谈又没有进展。它指出，如果“警察官职务执行法修正案”成为废案，众议院正副议长引咎辞职，那么，自由民主党内部追究岸信介政府和执政党领导干部的责任的活动一定会表面化，岸信介内阁发生动摇是不可避免的。
    据共同社报道，自由民主党内“在野”的“反主流派”正在起劲地挖岸信介内阁的墙脚，他们要建立“反主流派”的池田（勇人）派同三木（武夫）—松村（谦三）派、石井（光次郎）派的合作体制，完全改变“岸信介体制”的“基础关系”。
    为此，曾任近卫内阁和东条内阁大藏相的贺屋兴宣在11月10日和11日连续同岸信介、吉田茂和石井光次郎等人进行会谈，改组内阁的消息也不断在日本政界流传。据共同社说，贺屋的活动是在事前同现任大藏相佐藤荣作联系好了的。佐藤是岸信介的弟弟。
    共同社说，同时，岸信介的亲信也在“开始认真地考虑在收拾不正常局面以后，重建党内体制的问题”。岸信介的内阁官房长官赤城宗德曾经公开说“将会研究内阁改组等从根本上重建岸信介体制的办法”。赤城的谈话是为了迎合党内“反主流派”的改组内阁的要求，另一方面也暴露出岸信介打算在被迫改组内阁时将乘机加强他的统治地位。据共同社透露，因此，“主流派”领导干部批评赤城的谈话是“轻率的”。并且，从此以后，“内阁改组”已经成了岸信介政府和自由民主党首脑所忌讳的话。岸信介并且四出拉拢党内有影响的人物来为他圆场。前首相吉田茂出来为岸信介帮忙说，“在岸信介首相收拾局面的时候，不应该扯后腿，不应该做这样趁火打劫的事。目前是应该建立政党道德的时候。”
    据共同社透露，“反主流派”并没有放弃这样的打算：“由于警察官职务执行法修正案失败而产生的政治责任谁属的问题，将待收拾局面以后，为了‘建立政党道德’而加以追究。”
    目前，自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎等企图阻止“可能引起党内纠纷的内阁改组工作”，可是，共同社指出：“以目前已经开始涣散的政府和执政党的体制能否应付今后的政治局势，都是一个很大的问题。”
