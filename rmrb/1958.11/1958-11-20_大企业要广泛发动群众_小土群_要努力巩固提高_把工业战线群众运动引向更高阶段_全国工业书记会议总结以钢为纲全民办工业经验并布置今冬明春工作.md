Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The National Industrial Secretaries Conference held in Beijing concluded on the 14th. The conference summarized the mass movement of all-people industrialization with steel as the key link over the past two months and made arrangements for industrial production and transportation for this winter and next spring.

The conference was presided over by Comrade Bo Yibo. Participating in the conference were the principal responsible persons of the State Economic Commission and the State Planning Commission, the Party Group Secretaries of the central industrial and transportation departments, the responsible persons of the relevant departments of the central government, the directors and deputy directors of the various cooperation zones, and the Party Secretaries and Vice Governors of the various provinces (cities) and autonomous regions in charge of industry, totaling one hundred and twenty-seven people. Li Xuefeng, Minister of the Industrial Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, also attended the meeting and delivered a speech.

The conference began on October 4. After listening to Comrade Bo Yibo's report on "Launching a Large-Scale Mass Movement on the Industrial Front with Steel as the Key Link," the conference moved into group discussions and plenary speeches. The conference adopted a method that combined theoretical discussion with practical work.

The Mass Movement of All-People Industrialization with Steel as the Key Link is the Correct Path for High-Speed Development of Industrial Construction
The conference gave an extremely high evaluation of the mass movement of all-people industrialization with steel as the key link over the past two months. It was believed that the achievements were great and the gains were numerous. The movement provided many good experiences and also raised many new issues. Everyone unanimously believed that the great achievements of the movement were not only reflected economically, but more importantly, in its great political significance. It found the path of launching a large-scale mass movement on the industrial front with steel as the key link. This is the correct path for the high-speed development of industrial construction in our country. From now on, our country's industrialization undertaking will be carried out vigorously by the people of the whole country. Through the movement, the mysterious view of running industry was broken, the theory of passive balance was broken, and the theory of active balance with steel as the key link to drive everything else was established. Steelmaking also cultivates people, so that the people of the whole country have received diverse training. Because industry goes to the countryside and up the mountains, and farmers run industry on a large scale, favorable conditions are created for eliminating the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas. This is the result of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC criticizing dogmatism in industry, breaking superstitions, and liberating thinking. It is a victory of the Party launching a large-scale mass movement on the agricultural front after achieving a decisive victory, and then launching a large-scale mass movement on the industrial front. Chairman Mao's instructions on launching mass movements in industry have exerted tremendous power over the past two months. It proves that wherever the Party points, the mass movement moves towards, and there victory is achieved.

"Modern Groups" and "Small Indigenous Groups" Work Together to Fulfill the 10.7 Million Tons of Steel with Reliable Guarantee
The conference analyzed the situation of the movement and believed that the characteristics of the current mass movement on the industrial front are mainly manifested in two aspects, namely, the mass movement in modernized enterprises and the mass movement of "small indigenous groups." In modern enterprises, the broad masses of workers, after the rectification movement, have greatly increased their communist spirit and truly treat labor and the entire enterprise with the attitude of masters, giving the enterprise a completely new look. Many enterprises have implemented the "two participations, one reform" system of cadres participating in labor, workers participating in management, and reforming unreasonable rules and regulations, which has brought about a revolutionary transformation in the management of enterprises. Therefore, an unprecedented leap forward situation has emerged in production. In the "small indigenous groups" aspect, because of putting politics in command, widely mobilizing the masses, and Party secretaries at all levels personally going to the front line to direct battles, they have become invincible and unbeatable, creating amazing miracles in a short period of two months. Sixty million people across the country have投入 (invested/thrown themselves into) this battle, with millions of newly built indigenous iron and steel furnaces and other small enterprises and handicraft workshops dotted all over the country. These small enterprises and handicraft workshops have become an important component of our country's industrial front.

The result of the "modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" fighting for steel is that the national steel production has increased by leaps and bounds. As of November 11, the country had already produced more than 8.2 million tons of steel and more than 17.7 million tons of iron. The average daily steel production in the first ten days of November increased more than double that of the first ten days of October, and iron increased more than double. In this way, not only is there a reliable guarantee for completing this year's leap forward plan of 10.7 million tons of steel, but it also lays the foundation for achieving a greater leap forward next year.

Steel Drives Everything is Not Suppressing Everything; Currently the Main Rope is Being Lifted, and the Mesh is Being Opened
When discussing whether the mass movement with steel as the key link drives everything or suppresses everything, the conference unanimously agreed that steel drives everything, and currently the main rope is being lifted, and the mesh is being opened. Driven by the steel industry, other industries and transportation have also made great leaps forward. By the end of October, the machinery industry had produced 7,601 sets of blast furnaces above 3 cubic meters, more than 4,400 sets of open-hearth furnaces, electric furnaces, and converters, and 36,872 blowers, providing the metallurgical industry with an annual production capacity of more than 30 million tons of pig iron and steel. Coal industry produced 70 million tons in October, doubling from September. In the power industry, the country generated 2.57 billion kilowatt-hours in September and increased to 2.75 billion kilowatt-hours in October. The power station originally planned to install 840,000 kilowatts, but now it is expected to install 1.8 to 1.9 million kilowatts, equivalent to the sum installed during the First Five-Year Plan period.

Some shortcomings have also occurred in the movement, squeezing some departments, but not all of them have been squeezed out. In order to use limited material resources in the main aspects, it is necessary to squeeze some departments and put them behind for a period of time. However, according to the development of the movement, it is necessary to adjust it in a timely manner based on the principle of ensuring key points and taking care of the general. In terms of labor, it was necessary for tens of millions of people to go to the battlefield to fight for 10.7 million tons of steel in the past, but now there are conditions and necessities to adjust the labor force and make reasonable arrangements between industry and agriculture and within industry, so as to achieve a double leap forward in industry and agriculture. It is wrong to stand outside the mass movement, point fingers, and pick faults. It is also not good to not face the shortcomings and problems in the movement.

(Continued on the Second Edition) Guiding the Mass Movement on the Industrial Front to a Higher Stage
(Continued from the First Edition)
Regarding the understanding of "small indigenous groups," after discussion at the conference, it was believed that running large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously and combining indigenous and foreign methods is an important guiding principle and policy in our country's industrial construction. During the First Five-Year Plan period, a batch of modernized large enterprises were built, which were the backbone of our country's industry and have played a great role in industrial construction. In the future, we must continue to build some modernized large enterprises.

However, our country is a country with a population of more than 600 million. To develop industry at a high speed and make our country's industry bloom everywhere, it is not enough to rely solely on modernized large enterprises. We must mobilize all the people, especially the 500 million farmers, to engage in industry on a large scale. In this way, we must start with "indigenous" and "small" methods. Practice has proven and continues to prove that the achievements of farmers running industry are huge. The role of "small indigenous groups" in our country's industrial construction must be fully estimated. It is wrong to regard "small indigenous groups" as merely a temporary means or "expedient." The "small indigenous groups" policy must continue to be implemented and cannot be denied, and it must be extended to other industrial sectors.

Of course, this kind of "small" and "indigenous" industry will change in the process of development. Some small ones will develop into medium-sized or even large ones, some will remain small, and some will even be eliminated. In terms of production technology and equipment, it will also gradually develop from low-level to high-level, from manual labor to semi-mechanization and mechanization. It is also inappropriate to be content with "small" and "indigenous" without transforming and improving it. Conduct "Five Determinations" work on "Small Indigenous Groups" to achieve Steel Base-ification and Production Factory-ization
Regarding the industrial production arrangements for this winter and next spring, after discussion at the conference, it was believed that the mass movement on the industrial front with steel as the key link is in full swing. In order to guide the movement to a higher stage, it is necessary to mobilize the masses extensively and deeply. Driven by the steel marshal, all departments are required to work hard to keep up. The exposed contradictions must be adjusted and resolved. The mass movement in modern enterprises must be further carried out, and the steelmaking and ironmaking of "small indigenous groups" need to be reorganized, consolidated, and improved while continuing to mobilize the masses to work hard to produce and improve quality. It is required that all provinces and autonomous regions, starting from now, carry out "Five Determinations" work on "small indigenous groups," namely, fixing the location (fixing the base), fixing the type (determining the excellent furnace type), fixing the group (allowing the furnaces to be in pairs, in groups, and in rows, some producing and some repairing), fixing the personnel (fixing the personnel), and fixing the leadership (the leading organs must have a division of labor, have those in charge of industry, and clarify the leadership relationship), so as to achieve steel base-ification and production factory-ization.

The principles of fixing the location are: (1) It must be based on the situation of ore resources; (2) There must be coal; (3) Transportation is convenient or may be convenient in the future; (4) The distribution of labor; (5) It must meet the requirements of the rational industrial layout of each province and region.

The base-ification and factory-ization of "small indigenous groups" and the issue of industrial layout are new issues raised in the all-people steelmaking and industrial blooming everywhere. Over the past two months, tens of millions of people have engaged in steelmaking on a large scale, spreading out tens of thousands of "points." Currently, it is necessary to plan and start establishing bases and fixing locations based on local resources, transportation, labor, and other conditions.

The base should also be divided into large, medium, and small within the scope of a province or region, and it should not be forced to be uniform. Currently, it should be mainly medium and small, and the continued development of the movement may also form some new industrial cities. As for some points within each region, especially within the People's Commune, it is not appropriate to concentrate them too early.

Improve Steel Quality and Turn as Much Steel into Materials as Possible; Vigorously Grasp the Steel Production of Key Enterprises
The conference proposed that there are two main problems that urgently need to be solved in steel production: First, improve quality and roll as much steel into materials as possible. To this end, the current task of steel production is to pass three tests: (1) The quality test of indigenous iron. In the previous stage, more attention was paid to quantity and less attention was paid to quality, which is also in line with objective laws. Without quantity, there would be no quality. But today, indigenous iron should have higher requirements: The first requirement is to minimize the content of sulfur and phosphorus, so that foreign furnaces can digest it; the second requirement is to be able to use and transfer it; the third requirement is to stabilize production generally. (2) The test of foreign furnaces eating indigenous iron (mainly converters). (3) To roll steel into steel products. Second, vigorously grasp the steel production of 18 key enterprises. In addition to requiring major enterprises to carry out mass movements in depth and extensively and give full play to the potential of enterprises, it also requires provinces and cities that produce a lot of iron to give priority to transferring good iron to key enterprises and machinery factories.

The most prominent problem in production in the first quarter of next year is steel products. Everyone believes that there are three solutions: (1) Grasp the manufacturing of rolling mills and vigorously grasp the production of steel products; (2) Reduce the consumption quota of steel products and practice strict economy; (3) Make reasonable allocations based on the specific situation of priority and urgency, with heavy and light, and light within the heavy, so that limited steel products can be used where they are most needed.

The conference required the machinery industry to complete the production and matching of rolling mills as the main task for this winter and next spring. First of all, we should seize the production of large rolling mills. We must achieve fast manufacturing, fast installation, and fast operation to ensure that rolling mills are put into production as soon as possible to produce steel products as soon as possible. In addition to rolling mills, power station equipment, machine tools, mining equipment, and transportation vehicles (mainly locomotives, vehicles, and automobiles) are also the focus of machinery industry production.

In order to meet the rapidly increasing transportation tasks, the transportation sector must give priority to transportation organization. Regularly adjust vehicles and change the situation of畸多畸少 (uneven distribution) of vehicles between railway bureaus. At the same time, actively improve the passing capacity of narrow sections of transportation, complete the double-track projects of the Beijing-Hankou and Tianjin-Pukou railways on schedule, expand and renovate stations and ports, and at the same time, vigorously engage in "small indigenous group" transportation.

As for other industries, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power will launch an all-people power generation movement this winter and next spring; the production of the coal industry has already made great leaps forward, and we must strive for even greater leaps forward next year; the main chemical products, cement, wood, petroleum, geological work, and light industry, especially the production and transfer of textiles, paper, and salt, all require a comprehensive arrangement to meet the needs of national economic development and people's lives.

In order to better complete this year's production task of 10.7 million tons of steel and to welcome a greater leap forward in industrial production next year, the conference finally required the entire Party to concentrate its will, unify its plans, and act in unison, fighting for one goal. The whole country is a chessboard, and the victory of the chessboard must be guaranteed first.

    大企业要广泛发动群众  “小土群”要努力巩固提高
    把工业战线群众运动引向更高阶段
    全国工业书记会议总结以钢为纲全民办工业经验并布置今冬明春工作
    新华社19日讯　在北京举行的全国工业书记会议14日结束。会议总结了两个月来以钢为纲全民办工业的群众运动，并且对今冬明春的工业生产、交通运输作了部署。
    会议由薄一波同志主持，参加会议的有国家经济委员会、国家计划委员会主要负责人，中央各工业、交通运输部门的党组书记，中央各有关部门负责人，各协作区主任、副主任，各省（市）自治区管工业的党委书记、副省长等一百二十七人。中共中央工业工作部部长李雪峰也到会讲了话。
    会议自10月4日开始，大会在听取了薄一波同志“关于以钢为纲在工业战线上大搞群众运动”的报告以后，即转入分组讨论和大会发言。会议采取论虚和务实相结合的方式进行。
    以钢为纲全民办工业的群众运动是工业建设高速度发展的正确道路
    大会对两个月来以钢为纲全民办工业的群众运动给予极高的估价。认为成绩很大，收获很多。运动提供了很多很好的经验，也提出了很多新问题。大家一致认为运动的巨大成就不仅表现在经济上，更重要的还表现在它的伟大的政治意义。找到了以钢为纲在工业战线上大搞群众运动的道路，这是我国工业建设高速度发展的正确道路。从此，我国工业化事业将由全国人民轰轰烈烈地来搞。通过运动，打破了办工业的神秘观点，打破了消极平衡论、建立了以钢为纲带动一切的积极平衡论。炼钢又炼人，就使全国人民都受到了多种锻炼。由于工业下乡上山，农民大办工业，为消灭工农差别、城乡差别创造了有利条件。这是中共中央“八大”二次会议批判了工业中的教条主义，破除迷信，解放思想的结果，是党在农业战线上大搞群众运动取得决定性的胜利以后，又在工业战线上大搞群众运动的胜利。毛主席关于工业搞群众运动的指示，两个月来已发挥了巨大力量。证明党指向那里，群众运动奔向那里，那里就获得胜利。
    “大洋群”和“小土群”比翼齐飞完成1070万吨钢已有可靠保证
    会议分析了运动的情况，认为当前工业战线上群众运动的特征，主要表现在两个方面，即现代化企业的群众运动和“小土群”的群众运动。在现代化的企业方面，广大职工经过整风运动，共产主义精神大为高涨，真正以主人翁的态度对待劳动，对待整个企业，使企业出现了完全新的面貌。许多企业实行了干部参加劳动、工人参加管理和改革不合理的规章制度的两参一改制度，使企业的管理工作有了革命性的转变。因此，在生产上出现了空前未有的跃进局面。“小土群”方面，由于政治挂帅，广泛地发动群众，各级党委书记亲临前线，指挥战斗，就战无不胜、攻无不克，在短短两个月的时间内创造了惊人的奇迹。全国有六千万人投入这个战斗，数百万个新建炼铁炼钢土炉及其他小型企业和手工工场，星罗棋布，遍及全国大小乡镇。这些小型企业和手工工场，已经成为我国工业战线上的一个重要组成部分。
    “大洋群”和“小土群”奋战钢铁的结果，就使全国钢铁产量飞跃地增长起来。到11月11日止，全国已经生产钢八百二十万多吨，铁一千七百七十万多吨。11月上旬钢平均日产量比10月上旬增加一倍多，铁增加两倍以上。这样，不但完成今年的一千零七十万吨钢的跃进计划有了可靠的保证，而且也为明年实现更大跃进打下了基础。
    钢带动一切不是压倒一切  目前纲正在举，目正在张
    会议在讨论到以钢为纲的群众运动是带动一切还是压倒一切的问题时，一致同意钢是带动一切，目前纲正在举，目正在张。在钢铁工业的带动下，其他工业和交通运输事业都有了很大跃进。机械工业到10月底止，全国已经生产出三立方公尺以上高炉七千六百零一套，平炉、电炉、转炉四千四百多套，鼓风机三万六千八百七十二台，为冶金工业提供了年产生铁和钢各三千多万吨的生产能力。煤炭工业10月份生产七千万吨，比9月份翻了两番。电力工业9月份全国发电二十五亿七千万度，10月份增加到二十七亿五千万度，电站原计划安装八十四万瓩，现在预计可以安装到一百八十——一百九十万瓩，相当于第一个五年计划时期安装的总和。
    在运动中也发生了一些缺点，挤了一些部门，但也不是全部挤掉。为了使有限的物资力量用在主要方面，在一个期间里对某些部门挤一挤，往后排一排是必要的。但根据运动的发展情况，必须根据确保重点和照顾一般的原则及时加以调整。在劳动力方面，过去几千万人上战场为一千零七十万吨钢奋战是必要的，但目前已有条件和必要，把劳动力调整一下，在工业与农业之间和工业内部之间进行合理安排，做到工业农业双双跃进。站在群众运动之外，指手划脚挑毛病是不对的，不正视运动中的缺点和问题也是不好的。
                                                  （下转第二版）把工业战线群众运动引向更高阶段
      （上接第一版）
    关于“小土群”的认识，经过会议讨论，认为大中小并举、土洋结合是我国工业建设中一个重要的方针政策。在第一个五年计划期间，建设的一批近代化的大企业，是我国工业的骨干，它在工业建设中已经起了很大作用。今后还要继续建设一些现代化的大企业。
    但是，我国是一个六亿多人口的国家，要高速度地发展工业，使我国工业遍地开花，仅仅依靠现代化的大企业是不够的，必须发动全体人民，特别是要把五亿农民动员起来大搞工业。这样，就必须从“土”的“小”的着手。实践已经证明并且还在继续证明，农民起来办工业的成绩是巨大的。对“小土群”在我国工业建设上的作用要作充分的估计。把“小土群”看作仅仅是临时手段或“权宜之计”是不对的。“小土群”方针必须继续贯彻执行，不能否定，而且要推广到其他工业部门去。
    当然这种“小”的和“土”的工业，在发展过程中是会起变化的。有些小的会发展成为中的甚至大的，有些仍然是小的，有些甚至会被淘汰。在生产技术装备上，也会从低级到高级，从手工劳动逐步发展为半机械化、机械化。安于“小”和“土”而不去改造和提高它也是不妥的。对“小土群”进行“五定”工作
  达到钢铁基地化、生产工厂化
    关于今冬明春工业生产安排，经过大会讨论，认为以钢为纲的工业战线上的群众运动，正方兴未艾，为了把运动引向更高的阶段，还要广泛深入地发动群众。在钢铁元帅的带动下，要求各部门努力跟上去。已经暴露出来的矛盾要调整、解决。现代化企业的群众运动还要进一步开展，“小土群”炼钢炼铁在继续发动群众努力生产、提高质量的同时，需要进行编整、巩固、提高工作。要求各省、自治区从现在起，就对“小土群”进行“五定”工作，即定点（定基地）、定型（确定优良炉型）、定组（让炉子成双成对、成组成列，有的生产，有的检修）、定员（把人员定下来）、定领导（领导机关要有分工，有分管工业的，明确领导关系），以便达到钢铁基地化、生产工厂化。
    定点的原则是：（1）要根据矿石资源情况；（2）要有煤炭；（3）交通方便或将来可能方便；（4）劳动力的分布状况；（5）符合各省区工业合理布局的要求。
    “小土群”基地化、工厂化和工业的布局问题，是全民大办钢铁、工业遍地开花中提出的新问题。两个月来几千万人大办钢铁，铺开了上万的“点子”，当前应该根据各地的资源、交通运输、劳动力等条件，来规划和着手建立基地和定点工作。
    基地在一个省、区范围内也应该有大、中、小之分，不要强求一律，目前应以中、小为主，运动的继续发展也很可能形成一些新的工业城市。至于各地区内，特别是人民公社内的某些点，不宜过早集中。
    提高钢铁质量，尽多变钢成材  大力抓紧重点企业的钢铁生产
    大会提出在钢铁生产上当前迫切要解决的有两个主要问题：第一、提高质量，尽多地把钢轧制成材。为此，目前钢铁生产上的任务是要过好三关：（1）土铁质量关。前一阶段注意数量多，注意质量少，这也是合乎客观规律的，没有数量，也就没有质量。但今天对土铁应该有更高的要求：第一条要求含硫、磷的成份尽量降低，使洋炉子吃了能消化；第二条以能够使用和调出为原则；第三条要求生产大体稳定。（2）洋炉子吃土铁关（主要是转炉）。（3）要把钢轧成钢材。第二，要大力抓紧十八个重点企业的钢铁生产。这除了要求各大企业深入广泛开展群众运动，发挥企业潜力以外，还要求产铁多的省市将好铁首先调给重点企业和机械工厂。
    明年第一季度生产中最突出的问题是钢材，大家认为解决的办法有三：（1）抓轧钢机的制造，大抓钢材的生产；（2）降低钢材的消耗定额，厉行节约；（3）根据轻重缓急、重中有轻、轻中有重的具体情况，进行合理分配，使有限的钢材用到最需要的地方。
    会议要求机械工业要把轧钢机的生产和配套工作，作为今冬明春的主要任务来完成。首先应抓紧大轧钢机的生产。要做到快制、快装、快运转，保证轧钢机及早投入生产早出钢材。除轧钢机以外，电站设备、机床、矿山设备、交通运输工具（主要是机车车辆、汽车）也是机械工业生产的重点。
    交通运输部门为了迎接急剧增长的运输任务，运输组织工作必须提到重要地位。经常调剂车辆，改变各铁路局之间车辆的畸多畸少情况。同时积极提高运输狭窄地段的通过能力，按期完成京汉、津浦等铁路复线工程，扩建和改建车站和港口，与此同时，还要大搞“小土群”运输。
    至于其他工业方面，水利电力部今冬明春要开展全民办电运动；煤炭工业的生产，已有了很大的跃进，明年还要努力争取更大的跃进；主要的化工产品、水泥、木材、石油、地质工作和轻工业，其中特别是纺织、造纸、盐的生产和调运都要求有个统筹安排，以满足国民经济发展和人民生活的需要。
    为了更好地完成今年一千零七十万吨钢的生产任务，为了迎接明年工业生产更大的跃进，会议最后要求全党要意志集中，计划统一，行动一致，为了一个目标而奋斗。全国一盘棋，首先要保证一盘棋的胜利。
