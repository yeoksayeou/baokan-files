Xinhua News Agency Report:
    A large-scale water conservancy construction movement to change the face of mountainous areas is underway in the arid regions of southern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

    Twenty-five medium-sized reservoir construction projects, distributed along the four rivers of Qingshui River, Jing River, Hulu River, and Shanshui River, have all commenced. After a half-year of hard work this winter and next spring, these reservoirs will be completed, with a total storage capacity of 690 million cubic meters, and the irrigation area can be expanded by 1.63 million mu. The mountainous areas of Guyuan Special District and Tongxin County, which have always been threatened by drought, will have an average of more than three mu of irrigated land per person, basically realizing water conservancy in the mountains. At the same time, dozens of small and medium-sized power stations can also be established, with a total power generation capacity of more than 2,500 kilowatts, which will play an important role in promoting rural electrification.

    宁夏山区修水利
    宁夏回族自治区南部干旱地区，正在掀起一个改变山区面貌的大规模水利建设运动。
    分布在清水河、泾河、葫芦河、山水河四条河流上的二十五个中型水库建设工程，目前都已经开工。经过今冬明春的半年苦战建成这些水库以后，蓄水量共可达到六亿九千万公方，灌溉面积可以扩大一百六十三万亩，一向受干旱威胁的固原专区和同心县的山区，平均每人将有水地三亩以上，基本实现山区水利化。同时，还可以建立中小型发电站数十座，发电能力共二千五百多瓩，对促进农村电气化将起重要作用。
