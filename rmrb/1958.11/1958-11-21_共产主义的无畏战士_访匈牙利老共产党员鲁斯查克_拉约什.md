    The Fearless Communist Fighter
    —An Interview with Hungarian Veteran Communist Ruscsak Lajos
    By Our Correspondent Wang Chongjie
    “Are you asking about Ruscsak Lajos? He is a true communist, a steel fighter that no force can subdue." This is what an old lady said when I asked about Comrade Ruscsak's address on Feli Street in Buda.
    Ruscsak Lajos joined the party organization on November 20, 1918, the day the Hungarian Communist Party was founded, but he was already a disabled person with only one leg at that time. When we entered his room, the white-haired old man greeted us with a cane. He held my hand tightly and said, "Hungary and China are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but the hearts of our two peoples are closely linked."
    A Soldier of the October Revolution
    This veteran communist first told us about his childhood. He was born in 1895 in a worker's family in Budapest. Life forced him to work in a factory at the age of fourteen. However, the little money he earned from working like a horse could not support his life. Every night, he returned home exhausted and hungry. His mother's tears made him even sadder.
    After the outbreak of World War I, he was immediately drafted into the army and sent to the front lines. He was wounded and captured in a battle with the Russian army. His left leg was amputated due to severe injuries. In the spring of 1917, while in Moscow, he gradually made contact with some Bolsheviks, attended their secret meetings, and read revolutionary newspapers. Because he carried out propaganda work among the prisoners of war, he was later sent to Petrograd.
    Petrograd was on the eve of the October Revolution at that time. Ruscsak Lajos actively participated in the workers' movement. At a workers' meeting at the Putilov factory, he saw Lenin. Every word of the great revolutionary leader seized his heart. During the great October Revolution, he personally witnessed the battle of the Russian working class to seize the Winter Palace and the victorious red flag flying over the Smolny Palace. He recognized the path to human liberation and saw the dawn of a new world.
     "The inhuman capitalists ruined my youth, took away one of my legs, and made it impossible for me to walk freely again. But on the land of Soviet Russia, I found the truth. The brilliant October Socialist Revolution gave me a new life and an invincible will to fight for the liberation of the proletariat."
    Ruscsak Lajos's voice was very firm. If you didn't notice his white hair, you would think you were listening to a young and strong soldier talking.
    In order to enable the Hungarian workers to be liberated like their Russian brothers, he tried to return to his country shortly after the October Revolution. However, the rulers of Finland and Sweden did not allow him to pass, fearing that he would spread Bolshevism to the West. He had to return to Moscow again. There, he made contact with Hungarian revolutionaries and actively participated in the Soviet regime's suppression of counter-revolutionaries.
    Defending the Hungarian Soviet
    In the summer of 1918, Ruscsak Lajos finally returned to Budapest. From the first day he arrived in his hometown, he actively participated in the working class's strike movement against the government's continued pursuit of the imperialist war and dictatorial autocracy. These surging revolutionary waves tolled the death knell for the Habsburg dynasty. When the Hungarian proletariat faced the task of directly seizing power, the Hungarian Communist Party was founded. Ruscsak Lajos was one of the first members of the party.
    The coalition government dominated by the Social Democratic Party bowed and scraped before the Entente Powers. In order to win the favor of the victorious imperialist countries, it even prepared to allow the Entente Powers to use Hungary to carry out anti-Soviet intervention. In February 1919, the traitorous government adopted cruel and terrorist means against the Communist Party, imprisoned many Communist Party leaders, and declared the Communist Party an illegal organization. At this time, the party put the struggle to establish a Soviet republic, eliminate the landlord-capitalist regime, and defend national independence on the agenda. Comrade Ruscsak's specific task was to carry out propaganda work in the army. At that time, the rulers controlled the army very strictly. In order not to be discovered by the enemy, Ruscsak often wrapped leaflets in rubber, tied them to his disabled leg, and secretly distributed them in the barracks.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Hungarian proletariat became the first to seize power after the Russian working class. On March 21, 1919, the establishment of the Soviet Republic was announced.
    The Soviet Republic nationalized capitalist enterprises, large estates of more than 100 holds, and rental housing, confiscated the property of major exploiters, implemented an eight-hour work system, and increased wages by 25%. At the same time, free school education was implemented throughout the country. The doors of scientific and cultural institutions were opened to the working people. The houses, sanatoriums, and convalescent homes of the rich were allocated to the working people and their children. This was truly an era of "flowers in full bloom."
    The establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic aroused the hatred of domestic and international reactionaries. The imperialists of the Entente Powers immediately organized a military offensive against the socialist regime. The exploiting classes who had been deprived of power stood on the side of the imperialist army and became open traitors. The party issued a call to the working class, working peasants, and all patriots to defend the achievements of socialism, national freedom, and independence. In these critical days, Ruscsak stood at the forefront of defending the Soviet Republic. Once, he was wounded in battle and his crutches were also broken. When he woke up, his comrades wanted to send him to the rear. But he resolutely stayed on the front line and continued to command the battle of a battalion he led. Red Army soldiers often said: "Comrade Ruscsak only has one leg, but he stands more firmly than people with two legs."
    The Hungarian Soviet Republic's one hundred and thirty-three days of heroic struggle are forever recorded in the glorious history of the Hungarian nation and the international workers' movement! After the failure of the Soviet Republic, the counter-revolution turned Hungary back into a country of ruthless rule by capitalists and landlords and "three million beggars," and into a battlefield for Western imperialists. The Horthy fascist regime launched a brutal white terror throughout the country.
    The Struggle in Fascist Prisons
    From the failure of the revolution until the autumn of 1922, Ruscsak was imprisoned in the Vác prison. The building of this prison was lower than the surface of the Danube River. He was confined in a dark and damp single cell. But Ruscsak never lost faith in the final victory of the working class. The inhuman torture did not subdue him either.
    The fascist bandits thought that after three years of imprisonment, this "near-death" cripple could no longer do anything. To whitewash their brutal crimes, they released Ruscsak. But the executioners' calculations were wrong. After leaving prison, Ruscsak immediately devoted all his energy to restoring and developing the work of the party.
    Half a year later, the fascist bandits imprisoned him again. This time he was imprisoned for four years. After being released from prison, he secretly transferred to the working-class district on the outskirts of Budapest to work. At that time, many comrades asked him to go abroad, but Ruscsak, for the sake of the liberation of the working class, disregarded his personal safety.
    From 1931 to 1935, he was imprisoned for the third time, and from March 1939 to September 1944, he was detained in a labor concentration camp. But no matter where he was, Ruscsak never gave up fighting the enemy.
    Not long after Comrade Ruscsak left the concentration camp, the Soviet Red Army approached the outskirts of Budapest. The long-awaited day finally arrived. He rushed to the Soviet-occupied area overnight. At that time, the Soviet army needed to advance to Berlin quickly, so Ruscsak actively led the construction of the Ferihegy Airport, which had been destroyed by the enemy, on the outskirts of Budapest. After half a year of victorious battles, the Soviet army liberated the entire territory of Hungary.
    Hungary was waiting for the working class to lead the reconstruction of the country and to complete the great cause of national rejuvenation. After twenty-five years of underground activity, the Communist Party stood freely before the Hungarian people for the first time, becoming the first party and the leading party in rebuilding the motherland.
    Ruscsak threw himself into the work of building the country's economy and political power with great enthusiasm, and successively led the work of building railways, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and reforming old officers and criminals.
    In the decade or so after liberation, the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Party, have achieved great achievements, transforming the country from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial country with unlimited development prospects.
    Picked Up Arms Again
    When talking about the counter-revolutionary riots in October 1956, Ruscsak's face turned gloomy. He said that this was the most insidious counter-revolutionary rebellion launched by the Western imperialists in collusion with domestic reactionary forces. If the counter-revolutionaries succeeded, the Hungarian people would be pushed into the abyss of new disasters. He denounced the treacherous behavior of the revisionists. During those tense days, Ruscsak took up arms again and joined the workers' self-defense force to defend the revolutionary fruits won by the bloodshed and sacrifice of the Hungarian working class.
     "I am already an old man with white hair. I have always fought loyally for the independence of the Hungarian nation and the liberation of the working people. But the counter-revolutionaries arrested me on November 1, 1956, and decided to execute me on the 4th. Thanks to the help of the Soviet Red Army brothers, I was able to continue to live and contribute my strength to building a communist society.
    Although Comrade Ruscsak is very old, he still engages in various tasks very earnestly every day. In the recent elections for the National Assembly and local councils in Hungary, he served as the chairman of the election committee for the first electoral district of the twelfth district of Budapest. He said, "As long as I live, I will work."
    It was late at night when I said goodbye to Comrade Ruscsak's residence. The streets of Budapest were already silent, but Comrade Ruscsak's firm voice still echoed in my ears.

    共产主义的无畏战士
    ——访匈牙利老共产党员鲁斯查克·拉约什
    本报记者　王崇杰
    “你问鲁斯查克·拉约什吗？那是一个真正的共产党员，一个没有任何力量能制服的钢铁战士。”当记者在布达山费利街询问鲁斯查克同志的住址时，一位老太太这样说。
    鲁斯查克·拉约什在1918年11月20日匈牙利共产党成立的那天，就参加党的组织，但当时他已是只有一条腿的残废人了。当我们走进他的房间时，这位头发斑白的老人持着拐杖迎来，他紧拉着记者的手说：“匈牙利和中国之间相隔千山万水，但是我们两国人民的心却是紧紧地连在一起的。”
    十月革命的战士
    这位老共产党员首先向我们讲述了自己的童年生活，他是在1895年生在布达佩斯一个工人的家庭中，生活迫使他十四岁便开始到工厂去做工。可是整天牛马似的劳动所赚来的一点钱，维持不了生活。每天夜晚他精疲力尽，饥寒交迫地走回家时，母亲的眼泪使他更加悲伤。
    第一次世界大战爆发后，他立即被征入伍并送往前线。在与俄国军队的交战中受伤被俘。左腿因伤重，只得割去。1917年春天在莫斯科的时候，他逐渐同一些布尔什维克取得了联系，参加他们的秘密会议，阅读革命报刊。因为他在战俘中进行宣传鼓动工作，后来被遣送到彼得堡。
    当时彼得堡正处在十月革命的前夜，鲁斯查克·拉约什积极参加了工人运动。在普梯洛夫工厂工人会议上，他看到了列宁。伟大的革命领袖的每一句话都抓住了他的心。在伟大的十月革命的日子里，他亲眼看到俄罗斯工人阶级夺取冬宫的战斗和飘扬在斯摩尔尼宫上的胜利红旗。他认清了人类解放的途径，看到了新世界的曙光。
      “惨无人道的资本家摧残了我的青春，夺去了我一条腿，使我不能再自由地走动。但是在苏维埃俄罗斯的大地上，我找到了真理。光明的十月社会主义革命，使我获得了新生，获得了为无产阶级解放事业而斗争的不可战胜的意志。”
    鲁斯查克·拉约什的声音是非常刚毅的。假如不注意他那斑白的头发，你会以为自己是在听一位年青力壮的军人谈话。
    为了使匈牙利的劳动者也能像俄罗斯兄弟一样的得到解放，他在十月革命后不久，便设法返回祖国。但是芬兰和瑞典的统治者不让他通过，怕他把布尔什维克主义传染到西方去。他只好又返回莫斯科。在那里，他与匈牙利的革命者取得了联系，并且积极参加了苏维埃政权镇压反革命的工作。
    保卫匈牙利苏维埃
    1918年夏天，鲁斯查克·拉约什终于回到了布达佩斯。从到故乡的第一天起，他就积极参加了工人阶级反对政府继续进行帝国主义战争和独裁专制的罢工运动。这些风起云涌的革命浪潮，敲起了哈布斯堡王朝的丧钟。当匈牙利无产阶级面临直接夺取政权的任务时，匈牙利共产党成立了。鲁斯查克·拉约什是党的第一批党员。
    以社会民主党为主的联合政府在协约国面前卑躬屈膝，为了取得帝国主义战胜国的欢心，还准备让协约国利用匈牙利去进行反苏的干涉活动。1919年2月卖国政府对共产党采取了残酷的恐怖手段，把很多共产党领袖关入监狱，并宣布共产党为非法组织。这时，党把建立苏维埃共和国、消灭地主资本家政权和保卫民族独立的斗争提到日程上来。鲁斯查克同志的具体任务，是到军队中去开展宣传工作。当时统治者把军队控制得很严，为了不被敌人发觉，鲁斯查克常把传单用橡皮包起来，系在那条残废了的腿上，带到军营中去秘密散发。
    匈牙利无产阶级在共产党的领导下，继俄国工人阶级之后第一个取得了政权。1919年3月21日宣布成立苏维埃共和国。
    苏维埃共和国把资本家的企业、一百霍尔特以上的大地产和出租房屋收归全民所有，没收主要剥削者的财产，实行了八小时工作制，把工资提高25％。同时在全国实行了免费学校教育。科学文化机关的大门在劳动人民面前敞开了。有钱人的房子、休养所、疗养所都拨给劳动人民及其子女使用。这真是一个“鲜花怒放”的时代。
    匈牙利苏维埃共和国的成立，招致了国内和国际反动派的愤恨。协约国的帝国主义者们立即组织了对社会主义政权的军事进攻，被剥夺了政权的剥削阶级站在帝国主义军队一边，成为公开的卖国者。党向工人阶级、劳动农民和所有爱国者发出了保卫社会主义成果、民族自由和独立的号召。在这危急的日子里，鲁斯查克站在捍卫苏维埃共和国的最前线。一次，他在战斗中受了伤，拐杖也被折断了。当他苏醒过来时，同志们要把他送到后方去。但是他坚决留在前线阵地，继续指挥了他率领的一个营的战斗。红军战士常常讲道：“鲁斯查克同志只剩下一条腿，可是他比两条腿的人站得更坚定。”
    匈牙利苏维埃共和国一百三十三天的英勇斗争永远载入了匈牙利民族和国际工人运动的光荣史册！苏维埃共和国失败后，反革命将匈牙利再度变为资本家和地主无情统治和“三百万乞丐”的国度，变为西方帝国主义者的角逐场。霍尔蒂法西斯主义，在全国展开了残暴不堪的白色恐怖。
    法西斯监狱中的斗争
    从革命失败到1922年秋，鲁斯查克一直被关在瓦茨牢狱中。这个牢狱的建筑比多瑙河的水面还低，他被禁闭在阴暗潮湿的单人牢房里。但是鲁斯查克从没有丧失工人阶级最后胜利的信心。惨无人道的酷刑拷打也没有使他屈服。
    法西斯匪徒以为经过三年的监禁以后这个
  “接近死亡”的跛子，再也不能干什么事了。为粉饰残暴的罪行，他们把鲁斯查克释放了。可是刽子手们的算盘打错了，鲁斯查克离开牢狱后，马上就把自己的全部精力都用于恢复和发展党的工作。
    半年后，法西斯匪徒又把他关进了牢狱。这次被监禁了四年。出狱后，他秘密地转到布达佩斯近郊的工人区去工作。当时很多同志让他到国外去，但鲁斯查克为了工人阶级的解放事业，不顾个人的安全。
    1931年到1935年，他第三次被关进牢狱，1939年3月到1944年9月又被关在劳动集中营中。可是不论在哪里，鲁斯查克都从没有放弃与敌人进行斗争。
    鲁斯查克同志离开集中营不久，苏联红军就进逼到布达佩斯近郊。梦寐以求的日子终于到来了，他连夜赶到苏军占领区。当时，苏军正需要迅速地向柏林进军，鲁斯查克便积极领导了在布达佩斯近郊被敌人破坏了的非里·赫兹飞机场的修建工作。经过半年的胜利战斗，苏军解放了匈牙利全国。
    匈牙利等待着工人阶级去领导重建国家，去完成民族新生的伟大事业。在二十五年地下活动以后，共产党第一次自由地站在匈牙利人民面前，成为重建祖国的第一个政党和领导政党。
    鲁斯查克满腔热情地投入了祖国经济和政权的建设工作，先后领导过修建铁路、镇压反革命、改造旧军官和犯罪分子的工作。
    匈牙利人民在解放后的十几年内，在党的领导下获得了巨大的成就，把国家从一个落后的农业国家变为具有无限发展前途的社会主义工业国家。
    重新拿起了武器
    在谈到1956年10月反革命暴乱时，鲁斯查克的脸色变得阴沉起来。他说，这是西方帝国主义和国内反动势力勾结起来发动的最阴险的反革命叛乱，如果让反革命得逞，匈牙利人民将被推向新的灾难的深渊。他痛斥了修正主义分子的叛卖行为。在那段紧张的日子里，鲁斯查克又重新拿起了武器，加入了工人自卫队，捍卫匈牙利工人阶级流血牺牲而获得的革命果实。
      “我已经是白发满头的老人了，我始终忠心耿耿地为了匈牙利民族的独立和劳动人民的解放事业而斗争着。但是反革命分子1956年11月1日逮捕了我，并决定4日枪决。由于苏联红军兄弟的援助，我才能够继续活下来为建设共产主义社会而贡献自己的力量。
    鲁斯查克同志虽然已年纪很大了，但是他每天还是非常紧张地从事着各种工作。在匈牙利最近举行的国民议会和地方议会选举时，他担任布达佩斯第十二区第一选区选举委员会的主席。他说：“只要我活一天，我就要工作一天”。
    夜深了，我从鲁斯查克同志的住所辞出，布达佩斯的街道上已经寂静无声，但是鲁斯查克同志的刚毅的声音依然回响在我的耳边。
