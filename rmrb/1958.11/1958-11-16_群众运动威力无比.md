    The past Gansu was backward, but the present Gansu is facing prosperity. In 1949, the entire province had only 982 dilapidated factories with 20,400 workers. Now, there are 380,000 factories of all sizes (including those run by the masses). Modern industries such as petroleum, chemical, metallurgy, machinery, and textiles have been established or are being established. The number of workers has reached 238,000, and another 2 million people are engaged in large-scale steel production. In 1949, grain production was only 3.9 billion jin, averaging only 300 jin per person, making it a grain-deficient province. This year, grain production reached 20 billion jin, averaging 1,540 jin per person, transforming it into a grain-surplus province. Education and scientific research have also made considerable progress.
    In the process of changing Gansu's backward economic and cultural conditions, the people of Gansu have demonstrated a noble communist spirit in their struggle against nature. In order to overcome the perennial erosion of wind and sand, they built the world's rare "Green Great Wall." In order to overcome frequent droughts and change the climate, they diverted a large amount of water up the mountains, dug the "Mountain Canal" - the Intro River Project, and launched a campaign to encircle and suppress drought. In order to eradicate the problem of soil erosion on 170,000 square kilometers, 20,000 "Dengjia Forts" have emerged throughout the province, and recently, more than 30,000 people fought a major battle at Huajia Ridge, bringing soil and water conservation to an advanced stage.
    The work of transforming the natural landscape is arduous. The people of Gansu are fearless in the face of this. When they understood the truth that man can conquer nature under the guidance of the Party, they either did not act, or when they did act, they focused on long-term interests, starting from overall planning, comprehensive utilization, widespread development, and large-scale mass movements. In recent years, they have continuously carried out large-scale afforestation, water diversion up the mountains, and Dengjia Fort soil and water conservation movements. Each movement is magnificent, and people are energetic, so they can be completed in a short time with high efficiency. The effectiveness of this year's movement has reached a new peak. 17.9 million mu of irrigated land have been built, which is 4.5 times the amount of irrigated land before liberation and 2.5 times the amount of newly built irrigated land after liberation. 51,000 square kilometers of soil and water conservation have been completed, which is 3,000 times the amount before liberation and 1.7 times the workload of the eight years after liberation. 40 million mu of afforestation have been carried out, which is 13 times the afforestation area after liberation. Gansu has a total population of 13 million, and based on an agricultural population of 11 million, each person, in addition to cultivating 5.5 mu of land, must also build 1.7 mu of irrigated land, afforest 3.5 mu, and complete soil and water conservation on more than 6 mu. This does not include the workload of the Intro River Project and the labor paid by the 2 million people who are making steel. Judging from the amount of work undertaken by each agricultural population throughout the year, the people of Gansu have demonstrated a heroic spirit.
    The power of mass movements is boundless. Extensive mass movements also best represent people's communist spirit. The Party organizations of Gansu Province have led the people of the province in overcoming numerous difficulties and achieving victories in the march towards nature. In the future, they will also overcome all difficulties and advance rapidly. We wish the people of Gansu even more brilliant victories in the all-round leap forward, and greater prosperity in all undertakings, turning Gansu, a place that was once poor and backward, into a richer and more beautiful garden!

    群众运动威力无比
    田嘉
    过去的甘肃是落后的，现在的甘肃已经面向繁荣。1949年，全省只有破烂工厂九百八十二个，工人两万零四百人，现在有大小工厂三十八万个（包括群众办的工厂），已经建立和正在建立石油、化学、冶金、机械、纺织等近代工业，工人已达二十三万八千人，另外有二百万人正大搞钢铁。1949年粮食产量不过三十九亿斤，每人平均只有三百斤，是缺粮省，今年产粮二百亿斤，每人平均有粮一千五百四十斤，变成了余粮省。教育和科学研究事业也有长足进展。
    在改变甘肃经济、文化落后状况的过程中，甘肃人民在向大自然作斗争方面，特别突出地表现出高尚的共产主义风格。为了战胜风沙常年的侵袭，营造了举世罕见的“绿色长城”；为了战胜频仍的旱灾、改变气候，大量引水上山，开凿了“山上运河”　　引洮工程，展开了对干旱的围剿；为了根绝十七万平方公里上的水土流失之患，全省出现了两万个“邓家堡”，最近三万多人大战华家岭，把水土保持引向高级阶段。
    改造自然面貌的工作是艰巨的。甘肃人民对此无所畏惧。当他们在党的教导下懂得人定胜天的真理以后，不行动则已，一行动即从长远利益着眼，从全面规划、综合利用、遍地开花、大搞群众运动入手，几年来一直持续着规模浩大的造林、引水上山、邓家堡水土保持等运动。每个运动都是气势磅礴，人们精力充沛，因此能时间短，效率高。今年运动的成效达到新的高峰。修水地一千七百九十万亩，等于解放前水地的四倍半，等于解放后新修水地的二倍半。完成水土保持五万一千平方公里，等于解放前的三千倍，等于解放后八年工作量的一点七倍。造林四千万亩，等于解放后造林面积的十三倍。甘肃共有一千三百万人，按一千一百万农业人口计，每人除了种五亩半土地外，还要修水地一点七亩、造林三亩半、完成水土保持六亩以上，这还没有包括引洮工程的工作量和二百万人炼钢铁所支付的劳动在内。照每一农业人口全年负担的工作量来看，甘肃人民表现了英雄的气魄。
    群众运动的威力无比。广泛的群众运动，也最能代表人们的共产主义风格。甘肃省党的组织领导全省人民在向大自然的进军中已经克服了重重困难，并取得了胜利，今后也会克服万难飞快前进。预祝甘肃人民在全面跃进中取得更辉煌的胜利，各项事业取得更大的繁荣，把甘肃这块一穷二白的地方变成更富更美的花园！
