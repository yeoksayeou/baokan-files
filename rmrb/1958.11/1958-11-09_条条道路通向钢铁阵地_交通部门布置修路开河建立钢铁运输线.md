Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The Ministry of Communications convened a national transportation telephone conference on the 7th, pointing out that November is a decisive month on this year's transportation front. The transportation tasks related to steel materials this month are still very heavy, especially the transfer of pig iron. Time is pressing, and all regions must seize every second, transport as soon as it arrives, to ensure the early completion of this year's target of 10.7 million tons of steel. At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure the transfer of agricultural products and speed up the transport of winter supplies.

Since October, thanks to the great strengthening of the leadership of the Party committees at all levels over transportation work, a vigorous mass movement has been launched, and various means of transport have been mobilized for transportation. The national highway and local shipping consignment plans have been basically completed. The volume of freight transported by various provinces and cities in October reached 130 million tons, an increase of one and a half times compared to the average from January to August, and an increase of 69% compared to September. The transportation work in many places has made great progress, and the work has begun to shift from a passive situation to an active one. Henan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Beijing, Shanxi, and Shanghai, six provinces, regions, and cities, have all overfulfilled their consignment plans, among which Henan and Guangxi are particularly outstanding, exceeding by more than three times and two times respectively. However, the development of transportation in various places is still not balanced enough. Due to various reasons, the task of pig iron transfer has not been well completed in some areas. In some places, in the first two months, efforts were concentrated on transporting "marshal" materials, neglecting the transfer of general materials, resulting in a large backlog of daily necessities for the people; many agricultural products that had already been purchased were not transferred out on time according to plan, affecting market supply.

Vice Ministers of Communications Pan Qi and Kong Xiangzhen summarized the experience of the transportation work in the previous period in their speeches, emphasizing that strengthening the leadership of the Party committee and launching a vigorous mass movement is the most important experience in completing the transportation task. They pointed out that in order to quickly transfer pig iron, all regions must mobilize sufficient transportation forces and strengthen the command and dispatch of transportation in this regard. The roads from the location of the blast furnace to the transportation trunk line must be unblocked to ensure that cars and civilian transportation vehicles can pass smoothly. There should be spacious storage yards and turning areas in front of the blast furnace and at the transfer stations. At the transfer points of pig iron, ore, and coking coal, the loading and unloading forces should also be strengthened to ensure loading and unloading as soon as they arrive. The transportation department should strengthen cooperation with metallurgical, railway and other departments to make various transportation vehicles and materials closely connected. In arranging transportation, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the principle of ensuring key points and taking care of general needs.

In order to meet the heavier transportation tasks next year, the Ministry of Communications also requires all regions to launch a high tide of local transportation construction this winter and next spring, especially during the favorable opportunity before the autumn harvest is over and the water conservancy movement has not yet fully started, focusing on repairing roads and dredging rivers to build steel transportation lines, and driving other transportation construction work.

    条条道路通向钢铁阵地
    交通部门布置修路开河建立钢铁运输线
    据新华社8日讯　交通部7日召开全国交通电话会议，指出11月份是今年交通运输战线上决战性的一月，这个月有关钢铁物资的运输任务仍然十分繁重，特别是生铁调运工作，时间紧迫，各地要做到分秒必争，随到随运，以保证今年一千零七十万吨钢的任务提前完成。同时，还要保证农产品的调运，迅速赶运过冬物资。
    10月份以来，由于各地党委大大加强对交通运输工作的领导，大搞群众运动，动员各种运输工具投入了运输，全国公路和地方航运的托运计划基本完成。10月份各省市完成的货物运输量达一亿三千万吨，比1月到8月的平均数增长了一倍半，比9月份增长了69％。许多地方的运输工作有了很大进步，工作由被动局面开始转为主动。河南、广西、四川、北京、山西、上海六省、区、市都超额完成了托运计划，其中河南和广西特别突出，分别超额三倍多和二倍多。但是，各个地方运输发展的情况还是不够平衡的。由于多方面的原因，有些地区生铁调运的任务完成得不好。有些地方，前两个月集中力量运送“元帅”物资，忽视一般物资的调运工作，以致人民生活必需品大量积压下来；许多已经收购的农产品也没有及时按计划调运出来，影响了市场的供应。
    交通部副部长潘琪、孔祥祯在发言中总结了前一时期运输工作的经验，强调指出，加强党委领导，大搞群众运动是完成运输任务的一条最主要的经验。他们指出，为了迅速把生铁调运出来，各地要调集足够的运输力量，并加强这方面的运输指挥调度工作。从高炉所在地到运输干线的道路，必须畅通，保证汽车和民间运输工具能够顺利通过。高炉前和转运站都要有宽阔堆场和回车场地。在生铁、矿石和煤焦转运的地点，还要加强装卸力量，保证随到随装，随到随卸。交通部门要和冶金、铁道等部门加强协作，使各种运输工具和物资互相紧密衔接。在安排运输中，要认真贯彻保证重点照顾一般的原则。
    为了迎接明年更加繁重的运输任务，交通部还要求各地在今冬明春，特别是目前三秋将过水利运动还没有全面开始以前的有利时机，发动群众掀起一个地方交通建设高潮，以修路开河建设钢铁运输线为主，带动其他交通建设工作。
