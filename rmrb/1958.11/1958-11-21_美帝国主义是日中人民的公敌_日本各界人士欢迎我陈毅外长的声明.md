Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: Miyamoto Kenji, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement supporting the statement of Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi regarding the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." He said that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Japan and China. The attempt by the Kishi Nobusuke government to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" proves that it is willing to further subordinate itself to the United States and strengthen the system for launching a war of aggression against China.

Miyamoto pointed out that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement shows that the Chinese people are very concerned about this issue, which is natural. He said that this concern of the Chinese people is completely in line with the wishes of the Japanese people to abolish the "Security Treaty," strive for Japan's complete independence, and safeguard Asian peace.

Miyamoto severely condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's fallacy that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement was "interfering in Japan's internal affairs." Miyamoto pointed out that they are trying to spread such fallacies to conceal the Kishi Nobusuke government's participation in the U.S. interference in China's internal affairs.

Miyamoto demanded that U.S. troops withdraw from Japan and the Taiwan Strait area, and emphasized the importance of the four joint statements issued by the four Japanese non-governmental organizations that visited China some time ago with relevant Chinese organizations. These joint statements all condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's aggressive policy of following the United States in interfering in China's internal affairs. He said that we must work hard to clarify the meaning of these four joint statements and Chen Yi's statement to the Japanese people, so that everyone can deepen their understanding.

Miyamoto pointed out that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries appear strong on the surface, but they are not. He quoted Chairman Mao Zedong's words in "Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" and pointed out that as long as the Japanese people unite and struggle, the reactionaries will perish, and the final victory belongs to the people. He pointed out that the establishment of a national democratic united front is the guarantee of the Japanese people's victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement on the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has been greatly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Japan.

Koyama Ryoji, the Political Affairs Director of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), said today that Chen Yi's statement is a great encouragement to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Japanese working class, who have always demanded the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and are waging a struggle for this.

He pointed out that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is the root of the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile policy toward China. The intention to revise the "Security Treaty" this time is clearly to make Japan a partner of the United States in launching a war of aggression against China.

Koyama stated that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will work hard to strengthen and expand the struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and resolutely demand the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

Okada Muneyoshi, Director of the International Bureau of the Socialist Party, said that Chen Yi's statement expresses the hope that Japan will become a peaceful and neutral country, which is consistent with the basic policy of the Socialist Party. Okada said that he believes that only by taking the road of a neutral country can Japan achieve complete independence, make a contribution to Asian peace, and solve various outstanding issues between Japan and China.

Okada strongly condemned the reactionary policy of the Kishi Nobusuke government and demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government immediately stop the negotiations on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" that are currently underway with the United States.

Uchiyama Kanzō, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, and Yamamoto Kumao, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, said in unison that demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government revoke the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and change its policy of hostility toward China is the unanimous demand of the Japanese people. Without abolishing this treaty, there will be no complete independence for Japan, and the deadlock in Japan-China relations cannot be broken.

    美帝国主义是日中人民的公敌
    日本各界人士欢迎我陈毅外长的声明
    日共总书记宫本显治指出美日反动派表面看来强大其实是“纸老虎”
    总评政治部长小山良治认为陈外长声明对日本工人阶级是莫大鼓舞
    社会党国际局长冈田宗司要求岸信介政府立即停止同美国进行谈判
    内山完造和山本熊一同声表示日本人民一致要求改变敌视中国政策
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会总书记宫本显治发表谈话支持中国外交部长陈毅关于日美修改“安全条约”的声明。他说，美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人，岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的企图，证明它甘愿更进一步从属于美国，加强对中国发动侵略战争的体系。
    宫本指出，陈毅外长的声明表明中国人民对这个问题十分关心，这是当然的，他说，中国人民的这种关心是同日本人民要求废除“安全条约”、争取日本的完全独立和维护亚洲和平的愿望完全一致的。
    宫本严厉谴责岸信介政府诬蔑陈毅外长的声明是“干涉日本内政”的谬论。宫本指出，它们企图散布这样的谬论来掩饰岸信介政府参加美国干涉中国内政的行为。
    宫本要求美国军队撤出日本和台湾海峡地区，并且强调了前些时候访问中国的日本四个民间团体同中国有关团体发表的四项联合声明的重要意义。这些联合声明都谴责岸信介政府追随美国干涉中国内政的侵略政策。他说，我们要努力向日本人民阐明这四项联合声明和陈毅声明的意义，使大家加深认识。
    宫本指出，现在美日反动派从表面上看起来强大，其实不然。他引述了毛泽东主席在“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”里所说的话，并且指出，只要日本人民团结起来进行斗争，反动派是要灭亡的，最后的胜利是属于人民的。他指出，民族民主统一战线的建立是日本人民胜利的保证。
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：中国外交部长陈毅关于日美修改“安全条约”的声明受到日本各界人民的极大欢迎。
    日本工会总评议会政治部长小山良治今天说，陈毅的声明是对一向要求废除日美“安全条约”并且正在为此展开斗争的日本工会总评议会和日本工人阶级的莫大鼓舞。
    他指出，日美“安全条约”是岸信介政府敌视中国政策的根源，这次修改“安全条约”的意图显然在于使日本成为美国的伙伴，来对中国发动侵略战争。
    小山表示，日本工会总评议会将努力加强和扩大要求废除日美“安全条约”的斗争，并且坚决要求岸信介内阁下台。
    社会党国际局长冈田宗司说，陈毅的声明表示希望日本成为一个和平中立的国家，这是同社会党的基本政策一致的。冈田表示他相信只有走中立国家的道路才能使日本获得完全独立，使日本对于亚洲和平有所贡献，并且才能解决在日中两国间悬而未决的各种问题。
    冈田强烈谴责岸信介政府的反动政策，并且要求岸信介政府立即停止正在同美国进行的关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判。
    日中友好协会理事长内山完造和日本国际贸易促进协会会长山本熊一异口同声地指出，要求岸信介政府撤销日美“安全条约”、改变敌视中国的政策是日本人民一致的要求，没有废除这项条约，就没有日本的完全独立，日中关系的僵局也是打不开的。
