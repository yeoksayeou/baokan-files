	Iraq's traitor - Jamali
	Jamali was one of the most reactionary pillars of the Iraqi feudal dynasty and the most loyal lackey of the imperialists. He served as foreign minister of the Iraqi reactionary regime several times and also served as prime minister in 1953. He was the foreign minister of the Said government when the Iraqi revolution took place. He has always been known as "pro-Western." The activities he carried out while serving as foreign minister were based on the interests of the United States. He supported the US aggression against Korea and opposed the restoration of the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. During his leadership of the Iraqi delegation to the Bandung Conference, he had contact with the US ambassador to Indonesia and accepted instructions.
	According to the trial of the Iraqi Special Military Court, Jamali secretly concluded the US-Iraq "Security Treaty" with the United States when he served as prime minister in 1954. Under the instigation of US and British imperialism, Jamali participated in the activities of piecing together the Baghdad Pact.
	Jamali also participated in plotting conspiracies to interfere in and overthrow the Syrian government. According to the evidence presented by the court, Jamali had been plotting conspiracies against Syria since 1949. At a meeting held by Dulles, he said: "Because Syria blew up the oil pipeline, Iraq loses 700,000 US dollars every day. Therefore, the United States should get rid of the Syrian regime." During the Lebanese crisis this year, Jamali slandered the United Arab Republic in the UN Security Council for interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs. In fact, Jamali and the former Iraqi traitorous government transported a large number of weapons to Chamoun to massacre the Lebanese insurgents.
	Jamali is also an important murderer who suppressed and massacred the Iraqi people. Iraqi prosecutor Colonel Amin said, "To list all his crimes would fill several books."

    伊拉克的卖国贼——贾马利
    贾马利是伊拉克封建王朝最反动的支柱之一，也是帝国主义者的最忠实走狗。他曾几度担任伊拉克反动政权的外交大臣，1953年还担任过首相职务。伊拉克革命发生时，他是赛义德政府的外交大臣。他一贯以“亲西方”著名。在担任外交大臣时他所进行的活动都是以美国的利益为根据的，他支持美国侵略朝鲜，反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位。他在率领伊拉克代表团出席万隆会议期间，同美国驻印度尼西亚大使有接触并接受指示。
    根据伊拉克特别军事法庭审讯揭露，贾马利在1954年担任首相时秘密同美国缔结了美伊“安全条约”。贾马利在美英帝国主义指使下曾参加了拼凑巴格达条约的活动。
    贾马利曾参加策划干涉和推翻叙利亚政府的阴谋。根据法庭提出的证据，贾马利从1949年开始即已经在策划反对叙利亚的阴谋。他在一次杜勒斯举行的会议上，曾说：“由于叙利亚炸毁输油管，伊拉克每天损失七十万美元，因此美国应该搞掉叙利亚政权”。在今年黎巴嫩危机期间，贾马利在联合国安理会上诬蔑阿拉伯联合共和国干涉黎巴嫩内政，而实际上贾马利和伊拉克前卖国政府曾运送大量武器给夏蒙来屠杀黎巴嫩起义人民。
    贾马利同时也是镇压和屠杀伊拉克人民的重要凶手。伊拉克检察官阿明上校说过，“要列出他所有的罪行来可以写成好几本书”。
