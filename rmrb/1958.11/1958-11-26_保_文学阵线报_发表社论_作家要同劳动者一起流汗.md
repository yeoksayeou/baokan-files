    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 25th: To adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward movement in national economic construction being carried out by the whole people, the Bulgarian Writers' Association's organ newspaper, "Literary Front News," published an editorial on the 20th, calling on writers to change their work methods, approaches, and styles, calling on them to participate in physical labor, immerse themselves in life, and integrate with the people.

    The editorial said: "For our writers, especially our poets, literary figures, playwrights, and critics, changing the way, method, and style of immersing themselves in life is the minimum sign of whether they are willing to leap forward with the people. This will be an example for educating younger writers."

    The editorial continued: "Young writers must go deep into the countryside, factories, and construction sites, where they should carry out work and participate in labor, in order to accumulate rich life experience. For them, there is no other path to successful creation."

    The editorial said: "Writers should move there, and according to their work capacity, labor alongside the builders, sweat together with them, share their joys and sorrows, and share their hardships. Only when writers live there with their protagonists can they create vivid artistic images.

    保“文学阵线报”发表社论
    作家要同劳动者一起流汗
    据新华社索非亚25日电　为了适应全民开展的国民经济建设工作跃进运动的新形势，保加利亚作家协会机关报“文学阵线报”20日发表社论，号召作家改变工作方式、方法和作风，号召他们参加体力劳动，深入生活，同人民打成一片。
    社论说：“对于我们的作家，首先是对于我们的诗人、文学家、戏剧家和批评家来说，改变深入生活的方式、方法和作风，是他们是否愿意同人民一起跃进的起码标志。这将是教育较年轻的作家的榜样。”
    社论又说：“青年作家必须深入农村、工厂、工地，在那里开展工作，参加劳动，以便积累丰富的生活经验。对他们来说，别的成功的创作道路是没有的”。
    社论说：“作家应该迁居到那里，根据自己的工作能力，同建设者一起劳动，一起流汗，与他们同甘苦，共患难，只有作家在那里同他们的主人公一道生活，才能够创造出鲜明的艺术形象。
