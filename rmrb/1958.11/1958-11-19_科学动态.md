    Finding New Sources of Human Food
    The research work of the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on cultivating single-celled green algae (Scenedesmus, Chlorella) has achieved remarkable results.
    Single-celled green algae are a class of extremely valuable economic algae. They reproduce quickly, have high yields, and utilize solar energy much more efficiently than ordinary crops. Cultivating these plants can most effectively utilize solar radiation. These plants are particularly rich in protein, averaging about 50% of dry matter (milk powder has a protein content of 26%, lean pork 20%), of which 40% are the ten essential amino acids for humans. The oil content is also very high, around 10%. In addition, it is also a raw material for extracting vitamins and some valuable medicines. What is particularly advantageous is that the content of these chemical components has great plasticity, and the content of a certain substance can be particularly increased through directed cultivation.
    Based on the excellent nutritional value and powerful reproductive capacity of single-celled green algae, scientists have predicted that these plants will be a good source of food for space flight.
    For a long time, scientists from various countries have attached great importance to the cultivation of single-celled green algae. In particular, Japanese scientists once created the world's highest record of 6,000 jin (dry weight) per mu per year for open-air cultivation of Chlorella. Now, after three months of hard work, the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has created a new record of 12,000 jin per mu per year for open-air cultivation of single-celled green algae (Scenedesmus), realizing the slogan of surpassing Japan after three months of hard work. According to preliminary measurements, the protein content of Scenedesmus and Chlorella is 48% and 48.3% respectively, and the oil content is 13.4% and 11.3% respectively. The Institute of Hydrobiology has also managed to obtain algal species with a wide range of temperature adaptability, which can grow and reproduce at high temperatures of 35-40°C, and also at low temperatures of around 15°C.
    The Institute of Hydrobiology also used its own cultivated single-celled green algae to make biscuits and candies. These bright green biscuits and candies are not only the first in China, but also very rare internationally.
    New Type of Plastic Polypropylene Made
    The Shenyang Branch of the Beijing Institute of Chemical Research has successfully trial-produced a new type of plastic - polypropylene. This is another new achievement of the institute after making polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene and other plastics.
    Polypropylene is currently recognized internationally as a new type of plastic with excellent performance. This plastic has all the excellent characteristics of polyethylene, and also has many more valuable properties than polyethylene, such as a higher melting point than polyethylene, reaching about 170 degrees; (all thermoplastic materials are easily deformed and damaged when used in temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.) Mechanical strength and electrical properties are higher than polyethylene, and it has excellent corrosion resistance, and its water absorption is almost zero. Therefore, it is suitable for making radio equipment. The film made of it is transparent and beautiful.
    Another excellent property of polypropylene is its light weight. The synthetic fiber made from it can be compared with capron and other synthetic fibers, and has great development prospects. In addition, its production process is relatively simple and easy to operate. The raw materials are also cheaper.
    First Concrete Ultrasonic Flaw Detector
    The Construction Research Office and Processing Plant of the Institute of Building Research of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have successfully trial-produced China's first concrete ultrasonic flaw detector. Ultrasonic flaw detector is one of the best methods for non-destructive component determination of concrete quality. Using this method, the quality of concrete can be quickly, easily and accurately identified in actual structures. It can be completely unrestricted by conditions such as time, location and number of components.
    At present, the inspection of concrete quality has always been carried out using the method of destroying test blocks. This method not only wastes materials and labor, but also has many serious shortcomings, such as the conditions of test block tamping and curing are not consistent with the actual conditions, so the test results cannot well represent the actual situation of the concrete structure. The above-mentioned shortcomings can be completely overcome by using the ultrasonic flaw detector.
    Anhui Agricultural College Cultivates "Cotton King"
    In the cotton field of the Anhui Agricultural College Farm, there is a cotton plant that grows particularly tall and strong. It is as high as six feet, and the stem at the base is four inches thick. Everyone calls it the "Cotton King."
    The main stem of this cotton plant generally blooms seven or eight flowers every day. On October 17, it bloomed seventeen flowers in one day. By November 6, it had 112 fruit branches, and more than 700 cotton bolls and flower buds.
    The variety of this cotton plant is Dai Zi Cotton No. 15. After sowing, a large amount of fertilizer was applied, and the soil was frequently irrigated, insects were caught, and the soil was kept loose. The appearance of this "Cotton King" shows that cotton can be greatly increased by further intensive cultivation and strengthening management.

    科学动态
    找到人类食料的新来源
    中国科学院水生生物研究所培养单细胞绿藻（栅藻、小球藻）的研究工作，已经获得了显著的成绩。
    单细胞绿藻是一类极有价值的经济藻类。它繁殖快，产量高，对太阳能的利用率比一般作物高得多，培养这类植物可以最有成效地利用太阳辐射能。这类植物的蛋白质含量特别丰富，平均达到干物质的50％左右（奶粉蛋白质含量为26％，瘦猪肉为20％），其中有40％是人类所必需的十种不可替代的氨基酸。油脂含量也很高，在10％左右。此外，它还是提取维生素和一些贵重药物的原料。特别有利的是，它的这些化学成分的含量有很大的可塑性，可以通过定向培养把某一物质的含量特别提高。
    根据单细胞绿藻的高超的营养价值和强大的繁殖能力，科学家已经预言，这类植物将是宇宙飞行的良好食料。
    长期以来，各国科学家都对培养单细胞绿藻极为重视。尤其是日本的科学家，曾经创造了开放式（露天）培养小球藻每年亩产六千斤（干重）的世界最高纪录。现在，中国科学院水生生物研究所经过三个月的劳动，创造了开放式培养单细胞绿藻（栅藻）每年亩产一万二千斤的新纪录，实现了苦战三月超过日本的口号。根据初步测定的结果，栅藻和小球藻的蛋白质含量分别为48％和48.3％，油脂含量分别为13.4％和11.3％。水生生物研究所还设法获得了在温度上适应性很广的藻种，它既能在35—40℃的高温下生长繁殖，也可以在15°左右的低气温下生长繁殖。
    水生生物研究所还用自己培养的单细胞绿藻制成饼干和糖果。这种鲜绿色的饼干和糖果，不仅在国内是首创，而且在国际上也十分稀罕。
    新型塑料聚丙烯制成
    北京化工研究院沈阳分院试制成功新型塑料——聚丙烯。这是该院在制成聚氯乙烯、聚乙烯等塑料后又一新成就。
    聚丙烯是目前国际公认的一种性能优良的新型塑料。这种塑料，具有聚乙烯所有的优良特性，而且还具有许多比聚乙烯更可贵的性能，如熔点比聚乙烯高，约达一百七十度；（一切热塑性物料，在超过七十度温度中应用，即易变形损坏。）机械强度和解电性能都比聚乙烯高，并具有极好的耐腐蚀性能，它的吸水性能几乎等于零。因此，适用于作无线电装置。用它制成的薄膜，透明美观。
    聚丙烯另一优良性能是质轻。用它作的合成纤维，可与卡普隆等合成纤维比美，有极大发展前途。此外，它的生产过程较简单，易于操作。原料亦较便宜。
    第一台混凝土超声波探伤仪
    冶金工业部建筑研究院施工研究室和加工厂试制成功我国第一台混凝土超声波探伤仪。超声波探伤仪是无损构件测定混凝土质量的最好方法之一。采用这种方法，可以在实际结构中迅速、简易、精确地鉴定出混凝土的质量。它可以完全不受时间、地点和构件数量等条件的限制。
    目前对混凝土质量的检查，一直是采用破坏试块的方法。这种方法不仅浪费材料和劳动量，而且还有许多严重缺点，如试块捣固和养护的条件与实际条件并不相符，因此试验结果不能很好代表混凝土结构的实际情况。利用超声波探伤仪，就能够完全克服上述的缺点。
    安徽农学院培养出“棉花王”
    在安徽农学院农场的棉花田里，有一株长得特别高大、茁壮的棉花。它高达六尺，基部茎粗达四寸，别人都称它“棉花王”。
    这株棉花的主干一般每天要开七、八朵花，10月17日一天开了十七朵花，到11月6日统计，已有果枝一百一十二个，棉桃和花蕾达七百个以上。
    这株棉花的品种是岱字棉十五号，播种后，就开始大量施肥，并经常灌水、捉虫和保持土壤疏松。这株“棉花王”的出现，说明进一步精耕细作和加强管理，棉花还能大量增产。
