    For a Better Life
    By Our Correspondent Lin Mo

    Entering An'guo County, the wheat seedlings were indeed very different. The early-sown wheat had already emerged, with dark, dense leaves like a horse's mane. Some had only been out of the ground for half a month, but they already looked like a green velvet carpet, completely covering the ground.

    This foretells even bigger bumper wheat "satellites" next year.

    From the beginning of wheat sowing, people from other provinces, counties, and various parts of Beijing came to visit in an endless stream. In those large-area wheat "satellite" fields, the land cultivation and planting conditions alone were enough to be attractive. These "satellite" fields were thousands or tens of thousands of mu in size. Standing at the edge of the field, one could see that within a range of several li, everything was square and neat, row upon row, like a chessboard laid out on the earth. This is truly a great transformation of the land, a great change in the natural landscape. This high standard of farmland is the crystallization of China's thousands of years of farming technology, the bumper harvest experience of recent years, and agricultural science. Visitors all praised the magnificent spirit of the people of An'guo in transforming nature. And the people who cultivated it simply treated this field as a carefully crafted work of art. Some old farmers said that doing such work did not make them feel hungry even if they didn't eat, and they didn't feel tired even if they worked day and night.

    Those who have visited the grand occasion of wheat sowing in the fields have been moved by the large-scale labor scene and the masses' vigorous revolutionary spirit. In the fields, there were red flags and crowds of people everywhere. At first glance, it looked like a construction site for a reservoir. Men and women, young and old, throughout the county went to the battlefield of labor together. The villages were empty, and almost all the people were eating and sleeping in the fields. Harvesting in the front, planting in the rear. Harvesting, delivering manure, turning the soil... various specialized farming teams adopted assembly line operations, wave after wave. Here, the boundary between day and night no longer existed. Gas lamps, kerosene lamps, carbide lamps, and paper lanterns – all lighting tools were brought to the fields. Sparks were everywhere, people cheered, and horses neighed. High-spirited bugle sounds and exciting gongs and drums resounded everywhere. The night was sleepless. People proudly sang: "Our drive rushes past the sun and moon, our momentum sweeps through the wind and clouds; we must strive for the satellite seat, persevering day and night!"

    Throughout October, people fought day and night like this. The young men in the plowing teams, basking in the sun, competed in their strength, pushing forward row after row. When it rained, the rainwater poured over them, but they didn't care at all. But such elite troops were not very sufficient, and many of them went to the iron smelting front. Women who had been liberated from housework, organized children, and some elderly people played a major role on the autumn harvest and wheat planting fronts. Even the children in kindergartens were taken to the fields to pick peanuts and cotton, treating labor as a game. Elementary school students, led by their teachers, cut sweet potato vines and dug sweet potatoes, working like a gust of wind. After working for a while, they would beat drums, blow horns, dance, and sing, entertaining and cheering the adults everywhere. This kind of field propaganda team became an indispensable part of people's tense working lives.

    The unprecedented scene of a bumper harvest encouraged people, and the happy life of the people's commune and even better prospects inspired people. Labor was tense, but also joyful. "Look, when have we ever had so much stuff!" Liu Qingzhou, the production team leader of the Pioneer People's Commune, described people's feelings to me: "Now everyone eats their fill and wears warm clothes. There is grain everywhere, and you just feel happy when you see it! When you work, you just feel happy!" Look at Lu Fuyuan of the transportation team. He had a chronic stomach ailment and often had toothaches, so he couldn't eat well, but when he started working, he forgot everything. It was this infinitely optimistic and enterprising spirit that surrounded and moved people, and the enthusiastic working life that attracted people. Many elderly people who had entered the happiness homes also competed to go to the wheat planting front this time to show off their skills. Liu Laozhuo, a 99-year-old man from Donghe Village, couldn't do any work at all, but he didn't want to stay at home alone. He wanted to go to the fields to listen to the songs of labor, see the lights everywhere, and share the joy of labor. He looked at the cotton everywhere as white as snow, hugged a newly unearthed sweet potato, and smiled as he walked. Every time he went to a place to watch for a while, he regretted his age, saying repeatedly: "If only it were a few years earlier! A few years earlier, I would have picked up my tools and joined in! Now, working like this, it's really joyful and happy!"

    Liu Deshou, the captain of the Sixth Production Team of the Pioneer People's Commune, talked to me about people's understanding of labor. He said that in the past, people called work "suffering," but now people want to turn "suffering" into "sweetness." If you ask everyone: "Are you not tired from fighting day and night like this? Is it not hard?" They will say: "It is hard, but where does sweetness come from? The Communist Party is good, but it is not a money tree. Chairman Mao can only lead everyone to work hard, and a happy life must be created with our own hands." This year, we have worked hard for a year, and the grain yield has reached 3,600 jin per mu, so we don't have to worry about eating anymore. This year we have achieved enough to eat, and next year we will eat well. This year we eat coarse grains and sweet potatoes, and next year we will eat white flour. This year we use iron shovels to turn the soil, and next year we will use machines. Because people have seen clearly the road of communism, we are working harder and harder.”

    为了更美好的生活
    本报记者　林沫
    进了安国县境，小麦种的果然大不一样。种得早的已经出来了，叶子黑冬冬的，密的像马鬃一样。有的出土不过半个多月，就像一条绿茸茸的毯子，把地都给盖严了。
    这里预示着明年小麦将放出更大的丰产“卫星”。
    从种麦开始，外省外县和北京各地到这里参观的人就络绎不绝。在那些大面积的小麦“卫星”田里，光是土地耕作、种植的情况就足够引人了。这种“卫星”田，几千、几万亩一块。人们站在地边一眼望去，在几里地的范围内，全是一格格方正的畦田，横看成排，直看成行，好像摆在大地上的一面棋盘。这真是土地大翻身，自然面貌大改变。这种高标准的园田，是我国数千年来的耕作技术、近几年来的丰产经验和农业科学的结晶。参观的人都称颂安国人民这种改造自然的宏伟气魄。而耕种的人简直把这种田当作精工细作的艺术品。有些老农民说，做出这样的活来，不吃饭也不觉得饿，昼夜干也不觉得累。
    到这里参观过田间种麦盛况的人，都为那大规模的劳动场面和群众生龙活虎般的革命干劲所感动。田野里，到处是红旗和劳动的人群，乍看起来，好像修水库的工地。全县的男女老幼一起走上劳动的战场，村子里都空了，几乎全部人马都食宿在田间。前面抢收，后面抢种。收割的、送粪的、翻地的……，各种专业耕作队采取流水作业，一浪赶着一浪。在这里，白天和黑夜的界限已经不存在了。汽灯、马灯、电石灯、纸灯笼，一切照明工具都带到了田间。星火遍地，人欢马叫，处处是高昂的军号响声，激动人心的锣鼓。夜是不眠的。人们骄傲地唱：“干劲冲日月，气势卷风云；要争卫星座，日夜不休沉！”
    整个10月，人们就是这样日日夜夜地战斗着。那些翻地队的青年小伙子们，在阳光下，光着膀子比干劲，一排一排地向前推进。天下雨了，雨水在身上浇流着，他们也毫不在乎。但是这样的精锐部队并不很充足，他们有许多人上了炼铁前线。从家务劳动中解放出来的妇女，组织起来的儿童和一些老年人，在秋收、种麦战线上起了大作用。幼儿园的孩子们，也被带到地里拣花生、摘棉花，他们把劳动当作游戏。小学生们也在教师的带领下割甘薯秧子，刨甘薯，干起活来像一阵风一样。他们干一阵活，就打起鼓、吹起号、跳起舞、唱起歌，到处为大人娱乐助兴。这种田间宣传队成为人们紧张的劳动生活中不可缺少的东西了。
    空前大丰收的景象鼓舞着人们，人民公社的幸福生活和更加美好的前景激励着人们，劳动是紧张的，又是欢乐的。“你看，什么时候有过这么多东西呵！”先锋人民公社的生产队长刘清洲向我描述着人们的心情：“如今人人吃的饱，穿的暖，到处是粮食，一看心里就喜欢！干起活来，只是个乐呵！”看看运输队的卢福元吧，他是个老胃病，又常闹牙痛，饭不能好好吃，可是一干起活来，什么都忘了。就是这种无限乐观进取的精神包围和激动着人们，热烈的劳动生活吸引着人们，有许多进了幸福院的老人，这次也都争着要到种麦的战线上，显一显自己的身手。东河村九十九岁的老人刘老拙，实在不能干什么活了，却也不愿一个人呆在家里，他要到田里听听劳动的歌声，看看遍地的灯火，分享劳动的欢乐。他望望那遍地如雪的棉花，抱一抱新出的大甘薯，随走随笑。每到一个地方看一阵子，他就为自己的年岁惋惜起来，嘴里连连地说：“要是再早几年就好了！再早几年，怎么着我拿起家伙下去闹腾一阵子！如今这么干活，欢天喜地的实在乐乎人哪！”
    先锋人民公社第六生产队的队长刘德寿同我谈论起人们对劳动的认识。他说，过去人们把干活叫“受苦”，如今人们把“苦”要变成“甜”。你如果问大家：“这么日夜鏖战，不累吗？不苦吗？”他们会说：“苦是苦，但甜从哪儿来？共产党好，但他不是摇钱树，毛主席只能领导着大家干，幸福的生活必须用我们自己的双手来创造。”今年我们苦干了一年，粮食达到亩产三千六百斤，吃饭的问题再也不用发愁了。今年达到吃得饱，明年我们就要吃得好。今年吃的是杂粮和甘薯，明年我们就要吃白面。今年翻地用铁锨，明年我们就要用机器。因为人们看清了共产主义这条道儿，所以我们就越干越起劲。”
