    Mental and manual labor's division is a product of a certain stage of social development, having its processes of arising, developing, and disappearing. But mental and manual labor are two different forms of labor. As for these two forms themselves, they will still exist in the future. Even in a future communist society, manual labor will require little physical exertion, and every member of society will engage in both mental and manual labor, unifying these two forms of labor within one person. However, the difference between these two forms of labor will still exist. What we want to eliminate is the division of mental and manual labor, the inequality where some people in society specialize in intellectual activities, and others specialize in manual labor, not to eliminate the difference between these two forms of labor themselves, because that is impossible.

    In the past, some people thought that eliminating the difference between mental and manual labor was simply a matter of raising the scientific and cultural level of workers and peasants to that of scientists, engineers, and technicians. In reality, doing this is not enough. It only solves one aspect of the problem—"worker-peasant intellectualization"—while the problem of "intellectual laborization" remains unresolved. In the final analysis, the division of mental and manual labor is not fundamentally eliminated. Although Marxist-Leninist classic writers raised this issue, it was not resolved in practice due to the limitations of the conditions at the time. The measures taken by our Party, such as cadres going to lower levels for labor training, workers participating in enterprise management, factories and people's communes running schools, and schools running factories (farms), are all important measures taken to solve this problem and to combine mental and manual labor, thereby fundamentally eliminating the division between the two.

    The combination of mental and manual labor is the best way to eliminate the difference between mental and manual labor. Solving this problem creates conditions for the transition to communism because: First, a communist society requires well-rounded new people, requiring that every member of society's intelligence and physical strength can be developed. Neither the development of intelligence alone nor the development of physical strength alone is what a communist society requires. The development of production not only requires people to be able to transfer from one production sector to another but also requires people to transfer between manual and mental labor. The current situation in our country has already proven this point. The Great Leap Forward in agriculture requires some people to support the countryside. The mass movement for industrialization, centered on steelmaking, mobilized millions of people to engage in industrial production. There are instances of agriculture supporting industry and workers transferring within production units. Some of these people who transfer to new labor units originally lacked production knowledge, or lacked a certain kind of production knowledge, and inevitably encounter some difficulties at the beginning, unable to fully play their role. It can be imagined that in a communist society, every member of society will have considerable development in both intelligence and physical strength, capable of engaging in both mental and manual labor, while also mastering several production skills. In this way, when society needs it, people can transfer. The impact of this on social development will be enormous.

    Second, only when mental and manual labor are combined can the relationship between people achieve factual equality; otherwise, equality is incomplete. Because when this division exists, on the one hand, knowledge is still monopolized by a minority—mental laborers. Due to their social status and monopoly of knowledge, they will still bargain and act arrogantly in front of the working people, looking down on them. On the other hand, those engaged in manual labor cannot have enough time "to inherit everything that is truly valuable from the culture passed down through history—science, art, public life, etc.—and not only inherit it but also transform all of this from the exclusive possession of the ruling class into the common property of the whole society, and promote its further development," (see "On Communist Society," page 140, People's Publishing House). Only by allowing manual laborers to engage in mental labor and turning knowledge from the monopoly of a few into the common property of the whole society is it reasonable and equal.

    Based on the above views, I cannot agree with Comrade Wei Gao's views. I believe that our training goal should be ordinary laborers with communist consciousness who can engage in both mental and manual labor (combining the two).

    Comrade Wei Gao said: "People engaged in mental labor do not need to participate in manual labor; excessive manual labor will hinder their mental development... Similarly, laborers directly engaged in the production of material goods do not need to master too much theory." According to this view, there will always be an insurmountable gap between mental and manual labor. What does "excessive manual labor" refer to? From the entire article, it refers to the current work-study programs carried out in schools. Does even work-study hinder students' mental development? The "Exhibition of Combining Education with Productive Labor" in Beijing has given a negative answer. In fact, the opposite is true. It is precisely work-study, precisely the combination of mental and manual labor, that has created such miracles, that has made education work shine brightly, and that has made students' intelligence more fully developed than before. What truly hinders students' mental development is the kind of learning method that is divorced from reality and divorced from productive labor. Dogmatic learning will ossify people's thinking and hinder the development of their minds. On the other hand, is it true that laborers directly engaged in the production of material goods do not need to master more theory? Not so. Now, workers and peasants across the country have set off a wave of learning culture, learning technology, and learning theory. They urgently demand to master cultural and scientific knowledge to guide production. They have realized the great role of theory from practice. The fact is that workers and peasants have little time to study due to the tension of production tasks, not that they do not need knowledge or theory. Our task is to gradually create conditions and take measures to change this situation, not to make it continue forever.

    脑力劳动和体力劳动必须结合
    俞长彬
    脑力劳动与体力劳动的分工是社会发展一定阶段的产物，有它的产生、发展和消亡的过程。但是脑力劳动与体力劳动是两种不同的劳动形态，就这两种形态本身而言在将来还是会存在的，即使到了将来的共产主义社会，体力劳动使人们消耗的体力很少，同时每个社会成员既从事脑力劳动，又从事体力劳动，使脑力劳动与体力劳动在一个人身上得到统一，但这两种劳动形态的不同仍然存在。我们要消灭的是脑力劳动与体力劳动的分工，消灭社会上一部分人专门从事知识活动，另一部分人专门从事体力劳动的不平等现象，而不是消灭这两种劳动形态本身的不同，因为这是不可能消灭的。
    过去有的人认为消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别只要把工人、农民的科学、文化水平提高到科学家、工程师、技师的水平就够了。实际上这样做是不够的，它只解决了问题的一方面——“工农知识化”，而“知识分子劳动化”的问题还没有解决。归根到底，还是没有从根本上来消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的分工。马克思列宁主义的经典作家虽然提出过这个问题，但是由于当时的条件所限，没有在实践中得到解决。我们党所提出的干部下放，劳动锻炼；工人参加企业的管理；工厂、人民公社办学校，学校办工厂（农场）；……都是为解决这个问题所采取的重要措施，而使脑力劳动与体力劳动结合起来，从根本上来消灭两者之间的分工。
    脑力劳动与体力劳动的结合，是消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别的最好的形式，解决了这一问题，也就为过渡到共产主义创造了条件。因为：第一，共产主义社会要求有全面发展的新人，要求每个社会成员的智力与体力都能得到发展。单有智力的发展或者单有体力的发展都不是共产主义社会所要求的。生产的发展不仅要求人们能够从这一生产部门转移到另一生产部门，而且要求人们在体力劳动与脑力劳动之间相互转移。当前我国的实际情况已经证明了这一点。农业的大跃进，要求一部分人去支援农村，以炼钢为中心的工业化群众运动，动员了千百万人从事工业生产，农业支援工业，以及劳动者在生产单位上转移的情况，都是存在的。这些转移到新的劳动单位去的人们，有的原来没有生产知识，有的缺乏某一种生产知识，在开始的时候难免有些困难，不能充分的发挥作用。可以设想：在共产主义社会里，每个社会成员的智力与体力都有相当的发展，既能从事脑力劳动，又能从事体力劳动，同时又掌握几种生产技能，这样，一旦社会需要的时候，人们就可以转移。这对社会发展的影响将是巨大的。
    第二，只有脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合，人与人之间的关系才能达到事实上的平等，否则，平等就是不彻底。因为当这种分工存在的时候，一方面，知识仍然为少数人——脑力劳动者所垄断，由于他们所处的社会地位与垄断知识，他们仍然会讨价还价，在劳动人民面前盛气凌人，瞧不起劳动人民；另一方面，从事体力劳动的人就不能有充分的时间，“可以从历史上留传下来的文化——科学、艺术、公共生活方式等等——中间承受一切真正有价值的东西，并且不仅承受而已，还要把这一切从统治阶级的独占品变成全社会的公有物，促使其进一步的发展，”（见“论共产主义社会”140页，人民出版社出版），让体力劳动者也从事脑力劳动，把知识由少数人独占变成全社会的公有物，才是合理的、平等的。
    基于以上的看法，就不能同意魏高同学的观点，我认为：我们的培养目标应该是具有共产主义觉悟，既能从事脑力劳动、又能从事体力劳动（两者相结合）的普通劳动者。
    魏高同学说：“从事脑力劳动的人不必参加体力劳动，过多的体力劳动会妨碍他的脑力的发展。……同样，直接从事于物质资料生产的劳动者也没有必要掌握太多的理论。”按照这种意见，脑力劳动与体力劳动之间会永远隔着一条鸿沟，不可逾越。“过多的体力劳动”指的是哪些呢？从整篇文章来看，是指现在学校所开展的勤工俭学的活动，难道连勤工俭学的活动也妨碍了学生脑力的发展吗？现在在北京的“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”给了否定的答案，事实恰恰相反，正是勤工俭学、正是脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合，才创造出这样的奇迹，才使教育工作大放光彩，才使学生的智力得到比以前更加充分的发展。真正阻碍学生脑力发展的倒是那种脱离实际、脱离生产劳动的学习方法。教条主义的学习会使人们的思想僵化，会阻碍人们脑力的发展。另一方面，直接从事于物质资料生产的劳动者没有必要掌握更多的理论吗？不然。现在全国各地工人、农民已掀起了学习文化、学习技术、学习理论的高潮，他们迫切要求掌握文化科学知识来指导生产，他们从实践中体会到理论的重大作用。事实倒是工人、农民由于生产任务紧张，很少有时间进行学习，而不是他们不需要知识、不需要理论。我们的任务就是要逐步创造条件、采取措施，改变这一状况，而不是使它永远延续下去。
