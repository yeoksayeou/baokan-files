Rectification, Consolidation, and Improvement
-- A New Stage for the "Small Native Groups" on the Steel Front

The "small native groups" on the steel front have now entered a new stage focusing on rectification, consolidation, and improvement. The main tasks of this new stage are to achieve "Five Determinations" (determining sites, determining types, determining teams, determining personnel, and determining leadership), and to gradually and systematically construct a number of small-scale, combined native and foreign steel joint bases, in order to raise the vigorous mass movement of the whole people making steel to a new level.

Over the past two months, the "small native groups" on the steel front have demonstrated unparalleled power. Sixty million people across the country have invested in the mass movement of steelmaking and iron smelting, setting up tens of thousands of iron smelting points and steelmaking points, and building hundreds of thousands of iron smelting furnaces and steelmaking furnaces. Thanks to the large-scale "small native groups", cooperating with the "large foreign groups," walking on two legs, our country's steel production has soared in a short period of two months, and the plan to double this year's steel production is already a sure thing. The question now is, what is the next step? Should we return to our original positions because the great achievement has been completed, or should we continue to persevere? If we continue to persevere, should we persevere in the same way, or should we improve on the original foundation?

Believing that "the great achievement has been completed" and advocating "returning to original positions" actually reflects a temporary view that underestimates the role of the "small native groups," as if the "small native groups" were merely an expedient measure to complete this year's steel production doubling plan. Since the quantity of steel production is now almost there, and the agricultural front and other fronts are short of labor, why not "return to original positions"? This view is clearly wrong. The "small native groups" are not a temporary expedient, but a major component of our country's long-term industrial construction policy. Our country is a vast country with a large population. To achieve socialist industrialization at high speed in our country, and to rationally distribute our country's industry, creating conditions for eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants, we must walk on two legs with "large foreign groups" and "small native groups". Large and foreign enterprises are the backbone of the national economy, and there is no doubt about that. But if we only build large and foreign enterprises, we can only mobilize the strength of a few people, and the speed of our country's industrial development will be much slower. Small and native factories can mobilize the strength of the whole people, especially the 500 million peasants. Only by walking on two legs with "large foreign groups" and "small native groups" can we achieve high-speed industrial development and make industry spread throughout the country, creating conditions for eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants. It can be seen that the "small native groups" are not a temporary measure, but a long-term plan that is related to the high-speed development of industry and the spread of industry throughout the country, and is an indispensable leg in industrial construction. If, because we are confident of completing the plan to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, we pack up the "small native groups," everyone disperses, and returns to their original positions, it would be equivalent to retreating to the historical period of walking on one leg. There would be no guarantee for a greater leap forward in the steel industry next year, and the high-speed development of the entire national economy would inevitably be affected.

Then, what about persisting in the same way as before? It is correct to adhere to the method of "small native groups" and regard it as a long-term policy; but "in the same way as before" is also incorrect. Everything is developing and changing. The "small native groups" will also change in the process of development, from popularization to improvement, from a low-level stage to a high-level stage. In the past two months, the "small native groups" in the steel industry have basically been in a stage of trial, exploration, and popularization. At that time, the situation of mineral resources was still very unclear, and the broad masses of the people had not yet mastered the basic knowledge of steelmaking and iron smelting. Therefore, it was necessary to mobilize more manpower, deploy a longer front, and concentrate our efforts on first breaking through the technical barrier of steelmaking and iron smelting, and prioritizing the task of solving the quantity problem. At that time, if we demanded too much, seeking both quantity and quality, and talking about economic accounting, it would undoubtedly stifle the "small native groups". But now, after two months of development, we have learned more about the distribution of mineral resources, we have a mass force that has initially mastered the basic knowledge of iron smelting and steelmaking, and we have basically solved the quantity problem of steel production, which makes it possible to rectify, consolidate, and improve the "small native groups". This rectification, consolidation, and improvement is also urgently required by the current situation of steel production development. The urgent problems of current steel production are, first, to improve quality, and second, to adjust a part of the labor force to ensure a double leap forward in both industry and agriculture. Through the rectification, consolidation, and improvement of the "small native groups", implementing the "Five Determinations", and gradually and systematically building a number of small-scale, combined native and foreign steel joint bases, we can produce more and better steel with less manpower.

The most important thing in rectifying, consolidating, and improving the "small native groups" at present is to grasp the "Five Determinations". The purpose of the "Five Determinations" is to realize the factoryization of production, so that the high-yield steel production record of the "small native groups" can become a regular production level under the new conditions, and continue to improve on this basis. Among the "Five Determinations", we must first determine the sites. In the past two months, we have set up tens of thousands of iron smelting and steelmaking points, some of which are far from the source of raw materials and fuels, and the transportation is inconvenient, and the transportation cost is very high; some points are close to the source of raw materials and fuels, but the mineral reserves in these places are not large. It is obviously not necessary to further develop these iron smelting and steelmaking points, and they need to be rectified at an appropriate time, in order to concentrate manpower and material resources on the most reliable iron smelting points and steelmaking points. After determining the sites, we must also determine the types. The quality of the furnace type has an important impact on the output, quality, and life of the furnace. In the rich practice of various places in the past two months, a number of good furnace types with high yield and long life have been evaluated. On the established iron smelting and steelmaking points, these good furnace types with high yield and long life should be adopted to prepare the material for future normal production. After determining the sites and types, we must also determine the teams, personnel, and leadership. Determining the teams is to organize the furnaces into groups and the groups into rows, so as to organize production and maintenance in a planned way and ensure continuous normal production. Determining the personnel is to fix the personnel, so as to facilitate the improvement of technology and labor productivity. Determining the leadership is to require that each shift has a shift leader, each furnace has a furnace leader, each factory has a factory director, and each county and commune has a dedicated person to lead these iron smelting and steelmaking points, so as to strengthen political and ideological leadership, organizational leadership, and technical leadership. Only by realizing these "Five Determinations" can we realize the factoryization of production, and consolidate and improve the "small native groups" in steel production.

Among the current iron smelting points and steelmaking points, there must be a batch that will gradually develop in the direction of small-scale, combined native and foreign steel joint bases. This is because in the vigorous leap forward of the national economy, many places urgently need to establish their own relatively complete steel industry system, not only to produce some steel and iron, but also to be able to roll out steel themselves and use it in production and construction. This requirement has become possible due to the development of the mass movement of the whole people making steel. The mass movement of the whole people making steel in the past two months has made our country's steel output increase sharply, creating conditions for the establishment of a number of small-scale, combined native and foreign steel joint bases to provide equipment; it has enabled the broad masses of the people to attend a steel university for a period of time, preparing technical forces for the establishment of a number of small-scale, combined native and foreign steel joint bases; and it has actually conducted a nationwide general survey of iron and coal resources, discovering a batch of mineral deposits that can be mined on a relatively large scale for a long time, preparing resource conditions for the establishment of a number of small-scale, combined native and foreign steel joint bases. This kind of small-scale, combined native and foreign steel joint base, which turns the past single and scattered iron smelting points and steelmaking points into a relatively concentrated and complete joint enterprise, can smelt ore into iron, refine iron into steel, and roll steel into materials within the enterprise without round-trip transportation, and even manufacture its own machines, make its own coke, and extract various by-products from coal. This batch of "small but complete" steel joint bases can be built in a short period of time, and gradually form small industrial centers in places where there was little industrial base in the past, which will have a greater impact on the economic life and ideological life of the surrounding rural areas; it can cooperate with the large and medium-sized steel joint bases that have been built and are being built to form a steel industry base network that combines large, medium, and small sizes throughout the country. This is of extremely great significance to the development of our country's steel industry and even the entire national economy.

The development of the "small native groups" in the steel industry from popularization to improvement, engaging in the "Five Determinations", and engaging in small-scale, combined native and foreign steel joint bases is a new issue raised by the mass movement of the whole people making steel. In the face of new problems, there will always be some people whose thinking lags behind reality and cannot turn around for a while. For example, some comrades said: Isn't the "small native group" very good and solves problems? Why do we need to improve it again? Will engaging in the "Five Determinations" eliminate the mass movement? Does engaging in small-scale, combined native and foreign steel bases negate the "small native groups"? These doubts and concerns actually solidify the "small native groups" and regard them as an unchangeable thing without vitality. The essential characteristic of the "small native groups" is to use the power of the whole people to run industry, to mobilize the creative spirit of the whole people, especially the 500 million peasants, and to develop industry in every possible way and in accordance with local conditions using methods that are relatively easy for them to master. Our adherence to the "small native groups" is to adhere to the mass movement of the whole people running industry, and to adhere to the development of the creative spirit of the people. Since history has entered a new stage and we can rectify, consolidate, and improve the "small native groups" in the steel industry, we should actively carry out rectification, consolidation, and improvement. This is not negating the "small native groups", but developing the "small native groups", not restricting the mass movement, but developing the mass movement.

There are also some comrades who originally looked down on the "small native groups". When they heard that the "small native groups" in the steel industry were going to develop in the direction of improvement, to realize the factoryization of production, and especially when they heard that they were going to build small-scale, combined native and foreign steel joint bases, they became complacent. This is an even more erroneous thought that needs to be thoroughly criticized. Yes, we want to realize the factoryization of production, but this does not mean that we want to use the various rules and regulations and cumbersome forms that some large enterprises once adopted to organize the production of the "small native groups"; but to absorb the advantages of strict organization, discipline, etc. in the production of modern large enterprises to improve the production of the "small native groups". We want to gradually and systematically build a number of small-scale, combined native and foreign steel joint bases, but this is not to leave the existing foundation and reach the sky in one step, immediately engaging in many "small Anshan Iron and Steel," and "small Baotou Steel"; but to gradually develop and gradually improve on the existing foundation. The idea of walking on one leg will never have a chance to turn over. Thinking that the "small native groups" in the steel industry have entered a new stage of rectification, consolidation, and improvement, and that we can only want large and not small, only want foreign and not native, only want experts and not the masses, is completely wrong.

In order to rectify, consolidate, and improve the "small native groups" in the steel industry, the party committees of each province, city, and autonomous region must formulate a general plan based on the local situation of mineral resources, transportation, labor distribution, etc., and the requirements of the industrial layout of the province, determine how many points to determine, how many bases to build, and gradually implement them from small to large, from coarse to fine, and from low to high. When formulating and implementing the plan, we must seek truth from facts, not force uniformity, and not affect current production. In some places, the resources have not been clarified, and the "small native groups" have not been popularized, so we can temporarily not determine the points. Some points need to be rectified, and we must explain the reasons to the masses, do not rush to shrink, and cut them off coldly with one knife. Generally speaking, the bases are small-scale, combined native and foreign, but there can also be differences between large, medium, and small, and there can also be differences between foreign more than native and native more than foreign. In short, the rectification, consolidation, and improvement of the "small native groups" in the steel industry is a new issue, and we must adopt a positive and calm attitude, neither stagnating at the original level nor kicking away the "small native groups" under the pretext of "improvement".

We believe that after rectification, consolidation, and improvement, the "small native groups" in the steel industry will definitely develop better, and next year, our country's steel industry will usher in a more beautiful spring.

### 整顿、巩固和提高——钢铁战线“小土群”的新阶段

    整顿、巩固和提高
    ——钢铁战线“小土群”的新阶段
    钢铁战线的“小土群”目前已进入一个以整顿、巩固和提高为主的新阶段。这个新阶段的主要任务，是实现“五定”（定点、定型、定组、定员、定领导），并且逐步有计划地建设一批小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地，以便把全民办钢铁的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，提高到一个新的水平上来。
    两个多月来，钢铁战线的“小土群”显示出无比的威力。全国有六千万人投入炼钢炼铁的群众运动，布下了上万个炼铁点和炼钢点，建成了几十万座炼铁炉和炼钢炉。由于有了声势浩大的“小土群”，配合“大洋群”，两条腿走路，我国的钢铁产量在短短两个多月的时间内扶摇直上，完成今年钢产加番的计划已经稳操胜券了。现在的问题是下一步怎么走？是因大功告成而各回原位呢，还是继续坚持下去？如果继续坚持下去，是按原样坚持下去呢，还是在原有基础上提高一步？
    以为“大功告成”，主张“各回原位”，实际上反映了一种对“小土群”作用认识不足的临时观点，似乎“小土群”不过是完成今年钢产加番计划的权宜之计。既然现在钢铁生产的数量已经差不多了，农业战线以及其他战线又缺劳动力，何不“各回原位”呢？这种看法显然是错误的。“小土群”不是一时的权宜之计，而是我国工业建设的长期方针的一项主要内容。我们的国家是一个幅员广阔、人口众多的大国，要在我们的国家高速度地实现社会主义工业化，并且合理地分布我国的工业，为消灭城乡差别和工农差别创造条件，就必须用“大洋群”和“小土群”两条腿走路。大而洋的企业是国民经济的骨干，这是毫无疑问的。但是如果只建设大而洋的企业，就只能动员少数人的力量，我国工业发展的速度就会慢得多。小而土的工厂能够动员全民，特别是五亿农民的力量来办，用“大洋群”和“小土群”两条腿走路，才有工业的高速度发展，才能使工业遍布全国，为消灭城乡差别和工农差别创造条件。可见“小土群”不是什么临时措施，而是关系着工业的高速度发展，关系着把工业遍布全国的长久之计，是工业建设中不可缺少的一条腿。如果因为完成今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的计划已经有把握了，就把“小土群”收拾起来，大家散伙，各回原位，就等于倒退到用一条腿走路的历史时期去，明年钢铁工业更大的跃进就没有保证，整个国民经济高速度地发展也势必受到影响。
    那么，照原来的样子坚持下去又如何呢？坚持“小土群”的方法，把它当作一个长期的方针，这是正确的；但是“照原来的样子”也是不对的。一切事情都是发展的、变化的。“小土群”在发展的过程中也会起变化，会从普及向提高发展，会从低级阶段向高级阶段发展。过去两个多月来，钢铁工业的“小土群”基本上处在一个试办、摸索和普及的阶段。那时候，矿产资源的情况还很不清楚，广大人民还没有掌握炼钢炼铁的基本知识，因而必须动员比较多的人力，布置一个比较长的战线，并且只能集中力量首先突破炼钢炼铁的技术关，把解决数量问题列为首要任务。当时如果要求过高，既求数量，又求质量，还大谈经济核算，就无疑会扼杀“小土群”。但是现在，经过两个多月的发展，我们已经比较多地了解了矿产资源的分布情况，已经有了一支初步掌握了炼铁炼钢基本知识的群众队伍，并且已经基本上解决了钢铁生产的数量问题，这就有可能把“小土群”整顿一下，巩固下来，提高一步。这种整顿、巩固和提高，也是当前钢铁生产发展的形势迫切要求的。当前钢铁生产的迫切问题，一是要提高质量，二是调整一部分劳动力，保证工业农业双双跃进。通过“小土群”的整顿、巩固和提高，实行“五定”，逐步有计划地建设一批小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地，就可以用比较少的人力生产比较多比较好的钢铁。
    整顿、巩固和提高“小土群”，在当前最主要的就是抓“五定”。“五定”的目的是实现生产工厂化，使“小土群”的钢铁高产纪录，能够在新的条件下变成经常的生产水平，并且在这个基础上不断地提高。“五定”中先要定点。两个多月来，我们布下了上万个炼铁炼钢点，其中有一些点离原料、燃料产地比较远，交通不便，运输成本很高；也有一些点虽然接近原料、燃料产地，但这些地方的矿产储量不多。像这样一些炼铁炼钢的点显然没有必要再发展下去，而需要在适当的时候加以整顿，以便把人力、物力集中到最有把握的炼铁点和炼钢点去。定点之后还要定型。炉型的优劣，对于钢铁生产的产量、质量和炉子的寿命都有重要的影响。各地在两个多月的丰富实践中，已经评定出一批高产、长寿的好炉型。在既定的炼铁炼钢点上，应该采用这些高产、长寿的好炉型，为日后的正常生产作好物质准备。定点、定型之后，还要定组、定员、定领导。定组是把炉子编成组，把组编成列，以便有计划地来组织生产和检修，保证持续地正常生产。定员是把人员固定下来，以便于提高技术，提高劳动生产率。定领导是要求班有班长，炉有炉长，厂有厂长，县和社都有专人来领导这些炼铁炼钢点，以加强政治思想领导、组织领导和技术领导。只有实现这“五定”，才能实现生产工厂化，才能巩固和提高钢铁生产的“小土群”。
    在现在的炼铁点和炼钢点中，必然还有一批会逐步朝小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地的方向发展。这是因为在国民经济蓬蓬勃勃的大跃进中，许多地方迫切需要建立自己的、比较完整的钢铁工业体系，不只是生产一些钢和铁，而且能自己轧出钢材来，用到生产和建设中去。这种要求，由于全民炼钢铁的群众运动的发展，已经开始有了可能。两个多月来全民炼钢铁的群众运动，使我国的钢铁产量骤增，为建立一批小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地创造了提供设备的条件；使广大人民群众上了一期钢铁大学，为建立一批小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地准备了技术力量；并且实际上对铁煤资源进行了一次全民大普查，发现了一批能够比较大规模长期开采的矿藏，为建立一批小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地准备了资源条件。这种小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地，把过去单一的、分散的炼铁点、炼钢点，变成一个比较集中、比较完整的联合企业，能够不经过往返运输，就在企业内部把矿石炼成铁，把铁炼成钢，把钢轧成材，甚至能自己造机器，自己炼焦炭，自己从煤炭中提取各种副产品。这样一批
  “麻雀虽小，五脏俱全”的钢铁联合基地，能够在短期内建成，能够在过去很少工业基础的地方逐步形成小的工业中心，对周围农村的经济生活和思想生活将会发生更大的影响；能够同已经建成和正在建设的大型的和中型的钢铁联合基地配合一起，在全国范围内形成一个大中小结合的钢铁工业基地网。这对于我国钢铁工业，以至整个国民经济的发展，有着极其重大的意义。
    钢铁工业的“小土群”由普及向提高的方向发展，搞“五定”，搞小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地，是全民办钢铁的群众运动提出来的一个新问题。在新问题的面前，总会有些人思想落后于实际，一时转不过来。例如，有些同志说：“小土群”不是很好、很解决问题吗？为什么又要提高呢？搞“五定”会不会搞掉了群众运动？搞小型的、土洋结合的钢铁基地是不是就否定了“小土群”？这些怀疑和顾虑，实际上是把“小土群”凝固起来，看成是一种没有生命力的一成不变的东西。“小土群”的本质特征是用全民的力量办工业，是发动全民、特别是五亿农民的创造精神，用他们比较容易掌握的办法，千方百计、因地制宜地发展工业。我们坚持“小土群”，就是坚持全民办工业的群众运动，就是坚持发扬人民群众的创造精神。历史既然已经进入一个新的阶段，能够对钢铁工业的“小土群”进行整顿、巩固和提高，就应该积极进行整顿、巩固和提高。这不是否定了“小土群”，而是发展了“小土群”，不是束缚了群众运动，而是发展了群众运动。
    还有些同志，本来就看不起“小土群”，听说钢铁工业的“小土群”要向提高的方向发展，要实现生产工厂化，特别是听说要建设小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地，就得意起来。这更是一种需要彻底批判的错误思想。是的，我们是要实现生产工厂化，但这并不是要用某些大企业曾经采用的种种清规戒律和繁琐的表报，去组织“小土群”的生产；而是要吸取现代化大企业生产中严密的组织性、纪律性等优点，去提高“小土群”的生产。我们要逐步有计划地建设一批小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地，但这不是离开了现有的基础，一步登天，马上就搞许许多多的“小鞍钢”，“小包钢”；而是在现有基础上逐步发展，逐步提高。一条腿走路的思想永无翻身的日子，以为钢铁工业的“小土群”进入整顿、巩固和提高的新阶段，就可以只要大不要小，只要洋不要土，只要专家不要群众，是完全错误的。
    为了整顿、巩固和提高钢铁工业的“小土群”，各个省、市和自治区的党委，必须根据当地矿产资源、交通运输、劳动力分布等情况和本省区工业布局的要求，订出一个大体的规划，确定定多少个点，建多少个基地，从小到大，从粗到细，从低级到高级地逐步付诸实现。在制定和实现规划的时候，要实事求是，不要强求一律，更不要影响当前的生产。有些地方资源还没有弄清楚，“小土群”还没有普及，可以暂不定点。有些点需要整顿，也要和群众说明理由，不要急于收缩，冷冰冰地一刀砍下去。基地，总起来说是小型的、土洋结合的，但其中也还可以有大中小之别，也还可以有洋多于土和土多于洋之别。总之，钢铁工业“小土群”的整顿、巩固和提高是一个新问题，要采取积极的、冷静的态度，既不能停滞在原有水平上止步不前，也不能借口“提高”把“小土群”一脚踢开。
    我们相信，经过整顿、巩固和提高，钢铁工业的“小土群”必能更好地向前发展，明年，我国的钢铁工业将会出现一个更美好的春天。
