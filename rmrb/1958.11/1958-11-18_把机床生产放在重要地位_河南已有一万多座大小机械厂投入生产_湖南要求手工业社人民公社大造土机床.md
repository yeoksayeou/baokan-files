Xinhua News Agency report by reporter Liu Jiansheng: Henan Province vigorously implements the "small, indigenous, mass" policy in the machinery industry, relying on the masses to build indigenous equipment and machine tools to arm themselves.

Henan Province put forward the slogan "If there is no factory, build it yourself; if there are no workers, do it yourself; if there is no technology, learn it yourself; if there are no materials, contribute it yourself," which has enabled the machinery industry to develop and grow rapidly. All kinds of indigenous equipment and machine tools suitable for different production tasks have been created. Changyuan County used modified liberation-style waterwheels to create 212 lathes, drilling machines, planers, and round grinders. They used these indigenous equipment to produce 600,000 pieces of agricultural implements, more than 200,000 sets of bearings, and more than 100,000 pieces of smelting equipment, with an output value of 15.29 million yuan. The Minquan County Machinery Factory used indigenous machine tools to manufacture donkey engines, diesel engines, corn threshers, and a two-zhang gantry planer. The Gongxian No. 1 Machinery Factory used its own indigenous machines to produce 285 sewing machines with quality comparable to the "South China Brand." The 91 indigenous machine tools manufactured by the Yuxian Machinery Factory enabled the commune's machinery repair shop to achieve lathe-based operations. According to statistics up to the end of October this year, there are already 10,800 large and small machinery factories in the province, an increase of 2.84 times compared with last year; the number of employees has increased from 47,000 last year to 180,000, an increase of 2.83 times; and there are more than 20,000 machine tools of various types, of which about 5,500 are indigenous machine tools, and the mechanical production capacity has increased by more than two times compared with last year.

Now, from the province to the special districts, counties, and people's communes, a mechanical industrial network has basically been formed. In the past ten months, these machinery factories have produced 413 large-scale agricultural implements, 4,576 irrigation and drainage machines, manufactured and improved 63 million new-style agricultural implements, 26 million sets of bearings, 9,508 sets of metallurgical equipment, 410 sets of mining equipment, 2,709 sets of construction machinery, and more than 100,000 pieces of indigenous metallurgical equipment and mining equipment.

Henan Province recently decided to manufacture a large number of indigenous machine tools in November and December this year to further arm the province's machinery industry and prepare for a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production next year.

This newspaper reports: The machinery industry must quickly take command and get started, and party committees at all levels should grasp machinery production as they grasp steel production. This is the fighting call issued by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the province at an emergency machinery production meeting held at the end of October.

The meeting reviewed the completion of the current mechanical industry production tasks in Hunan, and believed that this year's steel smelting equipment manufacturing tasks have been basically completed. Now, machine tool production should be put in the first place, and the basic mechanical industry should be greatly developed. More machine tools should be produced, and various machinery factories, handicraft cooperatives, and people's communes should also vigorously produce machine tools to arm themselves in order to expand the mechanical industry's production capacity and more quickly promote the technological revolution movement in industry and agriculture. At the same time, metallurgical equipment supporting facilities, coal mine equipment, steel rolling equipment, power station equipment, etc., must also be guaranteed to be completed.

In order to ensure that the machine tool production tasks are completed on schedule, first of all, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, and vigorously carry out the technological revolution. First, it is necessary to improve the design, simplify the product structure, and vigorously develop simple machine tools. Unnecessary parts and structures on precision machine tools should also be simplified. Second, it is necessary to vigorously develop indigenous machine tools and "ant" machine tools to solve the problem of lack of equipment or unbalanced equipment in the mechanical industry. Third, improve tools, innovate operations, and improve production efficiency. (Attached picture)

    把机床生产放在重要地位
    河南已有一万多座大小机械厂投入生产
    湖南要求手工业社人民公社大造土机床
    据新华社讯　记者刘健生报道：河南省在机械工业中大力贯彻执行“小、土、群”方针，依靠群众自力更生地大搞土设备、土机床，用来武装自己。
    河南省提出了“没有工厂自己办，没有工人自己干，没有技术自己练，没有材料自己献”的口号，使机械工业迅速地发展壮大起来。适应不同生产任务的各式各样的土设备、土机床创造出来了。长垣县用解放式水车改装成车床、钻床、刨床、元车二百一十二台。他们就用这些土设备生产出了农具六十万件，轴承二十多万套，冶炼设备十万多件，产值达一千五百二十九万元。民权县机械厂用土机床制造出了锅驼机、柴油机、玉米脱粒机和二丈的龙门刨床。巩县第一机械厂用自己制造的土机器生产出了二百八十五部质量同“华南牌”相比美的缝纫机。禹县机械厂制造的九十一部土机床，使公社的机械修配厂实现了车床化。根据到今年10月底止的统计，全省已经有大小机械厂一万零八百个，比去年增加二点八四倍；职工人数由去年的四万七千人发展到十八万人，增加二点八三倍；拥有各种机床两万多台，其中土机床约有五千五百台，机械生产能力比去年增长了两倍多。
    现在从省到专区、县和人民公社，已经基本上形成了机械工业网，这些机械厂十个月来已经生产出大型农具四百一十三台，排灌机械四千五百七十六台，制造和改良新式农具六千三百万件，轴承二千六百万套，冶金设备九千五百零八套，矿山设备四百一十台，建筑机械二千七百零九台，土制冶金设备和矿山设备达十万多件。
    河南省最近决定在今年11、12两个月中，再制造大批土机床，进一步武装全省机械工业，为明年工农业生产大跃进作好准备。
    本报讯　机械工业要迅速挂帅上马，各级党委要像抓钢铁生产一样抓机械生产。这是中共湖南省委在10月底召开的紧急机械生产会议向全省发出的战斗号召。
    会议检查了湖南当前机械工业生产任务完成情况，认为今年的钢铁冶炼设备制造任务已基本完成，现在应该把机床生产放在第一位，大量发展基础性的机械工业，多生产机床，各机械厂，手工业社，人民公社也要大力生产机床，把自己武装起来，以扩大机械工业生产能力，更快地促进工业、农业的技术革命运动。同时，冶金设备配套、煤井设备、轧钢设备、电站设备等，也要保证完成。
    为了保证机床生产任务如期完成，首先要充分发动群众，集中群众智慧，大力开展技术革命。第一，要改进设计，简化产品结构，大搞简易机床，对精密机床上不必要的部件和结构也应简化。第二，要大搞土机床、“蚂蚁”机床，解决机械工业缺乏设备或设备不平衡的问题。第三，改进工具，革新操作，提高生产效率。（附图片）
    参观者：您厂的工作母机真大！
    工人：那是产品，这也是工作母机。 	邦达
