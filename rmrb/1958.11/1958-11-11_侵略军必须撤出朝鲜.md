    The Aggressor Troops Must Withdraw from Korea
    By a commentator of this newspaper
    On November 10th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country, representing our government and entrusted by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, submitted a reply note to the governments of all countries participating in the aggression against Korea through the British government. In the reply note, the governments of both Korea and China pointed out that the continued presence of troops from the United States and other countries in South Korea is the main obstacle to seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; and they requested them to change their rigid stance and take active measures in line with the national aspirations of the Korean people and the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world. The Korean people hope to unify the three thousand li of rivers and mountains and live freely without foreign interference. The people of all countries hope that the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible, thereby contributing to the relaxation of the situation in the Far East. Therefore, the demands of the Korean and Chinese governments are fully in line with the interests of the people of both North and South Korea and all peace-loving countries.
    The peaceful reunification of Korea is a matter for the Korean people themselves. In order to realize fair and free elections throughout Korea without foreign interference, all foreign troops must first withdraw from Korea. This is the consistent position of the Chinese people and government on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. From the first day of the Korean armistice negotiations, the Chinese government formally proposed the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. For more than five years, in order to break the stalemate created by the United States in Korea and provide favorable conditions for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Chinese government, together with the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has repeatedly made active efforts to promote the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers responded to the proposal of the Chinese and Korean governments and completely withdrew from Korea on October 26th this year. This proactive measure is of great significance for promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea and easing tensions in the Far East, and has been universally welcomed by the people of the world. If the countries that invaded Korea, headed by the United States, could take corresponding measures and also withdraw their troops, mainly American troops, from Korea, the prospects for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue could be greatly improved. However, the invading countries have refused to withdraw their troops under various pretexts, obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    The countries that invaded Korea still insist on the absurd proposition of holding so-called free elections first and then withdrawing their troops. This is actually deliberately putting the cart before the horse. The continued presence of aggressor troops in Korea threatens the peace and security of Korea and undermines Korea's independence and sovereignty. Under such circumstances, the Korean people cannot freely express their will. At the same time, the countries that invaded Korea have repeatedly insisted on holding elections under the supervision of the United Nations. As everyone knows, the United Nations, being on the side of the belligerents in the Korean War, has long since lost its qualifications to handle the Korean issue fairly and reasonably. The insistence of the invading countries on these unworkable propositions can only prove one point: they simply do not want to withdraw their troops from Korea and do not want to resolve the Korean issue peacefully.
    The fact is exactly so. Since the Korean armistice, the American ruling clique, which has misappropriated the banner of the United Nations, has been doing everything possible to undermine the armistice agreement and create tension in Korea and the Far East. On the twelfth day after the signing of the armistice agreement, the United States signed an aggressive "mutual defense treaty" with the Syngman Rhee group; in May 1956, it forced the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to withdraw from South Korea; in June 1957, it unilaterally announced the abandonment of the armistice agreement's provisions on the prohibition of reinforcing weapons and shipped atomic and rocket weapons into South Korea; it reorganized the American troops in South Korea into five-group atomic divisions; and it established missile bases near Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, in South Korea. From the armistice to June 26, 1958, the aggressor troops had carried out 792 provocative activities in the demilitarized zone or through the demilitarized zone in violation of the armistice agreement. Obviously, the aim of the American aggressors is to turn South Korea into an American military base and colony. This is also an important part of the American imperialists' aggressive plan in the Far East. However, the Korean people's will to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea is unyielding. If the American imperialists and their followers continue to stay in Korea, obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, then not only will they not escape the opposition and condemnation of all peace-loving countries and people in the world, but they will eventually be driven out by the Korean people!

    侵略军必须撤出朝鲜
    本报评论员
    11月10日，我国外交部代表我国政府并接受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，通过英国政府对参加侵略朝鲜的各国政府提出一项答复照会。朝中两国政府在复照中指出，美国和其他国家的军队继续留在朝鲜南部，是目前谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的主要障碍；并且要求他们改变僵硬立场，采取符合于朝鲜人民的民族愿望和世界人民的和平愿望的积极措施。朝鲜人民希望统一三千里江山，过自由生活而不受外国干涉。各国人民希望朝鲜问题能早日得到和平解决，从而有助于远东局势的缓和。因此，朝中两国政府的要求是完全符合南北朝鲜人民和所有爱好和平的各国人民的利益的。
    和平统一朝鲜是朝鲜人民自己的事情。为了在全朝鲜实现公正和自由的选举而不受外力干涉，一切外国军队必须首先撤出朝鲜。这是中国人民和政府对于和平解决朝鲜问题所一贯坚持的立场。中国政府从朝鲜停战谈判的第一天起，就正式提出了从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队的建议。五年多来，为打开美国在朝鲜所造成的僵持局面，为和平解决朝鲜问题提供有利的条件，中国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一起，曾一再为促使一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退作了积极的努力。中国人民志愿军响应中朝两国政府的建议，已于今年10月26日全部撤出了朝鲜。这个主动措施，对促进朝鲜和平统一和缓和远东紧张局势，都具有重大的意义，因而受到了全世界人民的普遍欢迎。以美国为首的侵朝国家如果能够采取相应的措施，也从朝鲜撤出他们的主要是美国的军队，和平解决朝鲜问题的前景本来可以得到很大的改善。但是，侵朝国家方面却以各种借口来拒绝撤军，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    侵朝国家方面至今仍然坚持先举行所谓自由选举然后才撤军的荒谬主张。这实际上是故意本末倒置。侵略军继续驻留朝鲜，威胁着朝鲜的和平和安全，破坏着朝鲜的独立和主权。在这样的情况下，朝鲜人民决不能自由地表示自己的意志。同时，侵朝国家方面还一再坚持在联合国的监督下举行选举。大家都知道，联合国处于朝鲜战争中交战国一方的地位，早已因此丧失了公平合理地处理朝鲜问题的资格。侵朝国家坚持这些行不通的主张只能证明一点：它们根本不想从朝鲜撤军，根本不想和平解决朝鲜问题。
    事实也正是如此。朝鲜停战以来，盗用联合国旗帜的美国统治集团一直千方百计地破坏停战协定，制造朝鲜和远东的紧张局势。美国在停战协定签订后的第十二天，就同李承晚集团签订了侵略性的“共同防御条约”；1956年5月，强迫中立国视察小组撤出南朝鲜；1957年6月，又片面宣布废弃停战协定关于禁止增援武器的规定，向南朝鲜运进原子和火箭武器；把在南朝鲜的美军改编为五群制原子师；在南朝鲜的江原道春川附近建立导弹基地。而从停战到1958年6月26日为止，侵略军先后在非军事区或通过非军事区违反停战协定的挑衅活动，就达七百九十二起。很明显，美国侵略者的目的是要把南朝鲜变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。这也是美帝国主义在远东的侵略计划的一个重要组成部分。但是，朝鲜人民争取实现朝鲜和平统一的意志是不可屈服的。美帝国主义及其追随者如果继续赖在朝鲜不走，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，那末，它们不仅不能逃脱全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的反对和谴责，而且最后一定会被朝鲜人民赶出去！
