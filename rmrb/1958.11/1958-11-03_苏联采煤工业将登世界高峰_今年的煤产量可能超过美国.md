Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 31st: A report from our correspondent: Soviet press materials indicate that the total coal output of the Soviet Union this year will increase from more than 463 million tons last year to nearly 500 million tons. Judging from the production of the American coal industry in recent years and this year, the Soviet Union may catch up with and surpass the United States in coal production this year, and become the world's number one.

The Soviet coal industry has developed rapidly, and coal production has been approaching the level of the United States in recent years. In 1955, the total coal output of the Soviet Union was equivalent to 80% of that of the United States, in 1956 it was equivalent to 88% of that of the United States, and in 1957 the coal output of the Soviet Union had reached 97% of that of the United States (the coal output of the United States last year was more than 483 million tons). This situation forced Lewis, chairman of the United Mine Workers of America, to admit in early May this year that the Soviet Union will surpass the United States in total coal production for the first time this year.

The coal production situation in the Soviet Union and the United States since the beginning of 1958 has further confirmed this. In the first quarter of this year, compared with the first quarter of last year, the coal output of the Soviet Union increased by 9%, while that of the United States decreased by 21%. In the first half of this year, the Soviet Union produced a total of 244.8 million tons of coal, while the United States only produced an estimated 187.4 million tons in this half year. By September this year, the coal mined by the Soviet Union had reached 371 million tons, equivalent to 108% of the same period last year.

The rapid growth of coal production in the Soviet Union fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. People still remember that in 1913, the year with the highest output before the October Revolution, Russia only produced 29 million tons, while the coal output of the United States at that time was more than 521 million tons, which was almost 18 times that of Tsarist Russia.

After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union's coal industry developed rapidly, while the United States' coal industry was declining. The Soviet Union produced 291 million tons more coal in 1953 than in 1913, with an average annual increase of 7.275 million tons. During the same period, the United States reduced its output by 78 million tons, with an average annual decrease of 1.95 million tons.

Although the coal output of the United States has increased at times, the growth rate is much slower than that of the Soviet Union, and the absolute increase in recent years is also much less than that of the Soviet Union. For example, in the past four years, the average annual increase in coal production in the United States has been 5.7 million tons, and the average annual growth rate has been 1.3%. During the same period, the average annual absolute increase in output in the Soviet Union was 30.6 million tons, and the average annual growth rate was 9.7%.

The number of coal mines in the Soviet Union is constantly growing. In the past seven years, the Soviet Union has built 500 coal mines and open-pit coal mines. This year, the Soviet Union will also put new coal mines with a total production capacity of 37.5 million tons into production. Due to the continuous development of coal mining bases, the annual output of Soviet coal mines will increase to 650 million to 750 million tons in the next fifteen years, which is about 50% higher than the current coal mining level in the United States.

### 苏联采煤工业将登世界高峰  今年的煤产量可能超过美国

    苏联采煤工业将登世界高峰
    今年的煤产量可能超过美国
    新华社莫斯科31日电　本社记者报道：苏联报刊材料表明，今年苏联的总采煤量将从去年的四亿六千三百多万吨增加到近五亿吨。从最近几年和今年美国采煤工业的生产情况看来，今年苏联在煤产量方面就可能赶上和超过美国，而跃居世界第一位。
    苏联采煤工业发展很快，采煤量在近些年来越来越接近美国的水平。1955年苏联的总采煤量相当于美国的80％，1956年相当于美国的88％，1957年苏联的煤产量已达到了美国的97％（美国去年的煤产量是四亿八千三百多万吨）。这种情况使美国联合煤矿工会主席刘易斯也不得不在今年5月初承认：苏联今年将第一次在煤的总产量方面超过美国。
    1958年年初以来苏美两国煤的生产情况更加证实了这一点。今年第一季度同去年第一季度相比，苏联的煤产量增加了9％，而美国则下降了21％。今年上半年苏联共生产了两亿四千四百八十万吨煤，而美国在这半年中据初步估计只生产了一亿八千七百四十万吨。到今年9月，苏联已开采的煤达到了三亿七千一百万吨，相当于去年同时期的108％。
    苏联采煤量的快速增长充分说明了社会主义制度的无比的优越性。人们还记得，在十月革命前产量最高的1913年，俄国只生产两千九百万吨，而当时美国的产煤量是五亿二千一百多万吨，几乎相当于沙皇俄国的十八倍。
    十月革命后苏联的采煤工业迅速发展，而美国的采煤工业却在走下坡路。苏联在1953年所生产的煤比1913年增加了两亿九千一百万吨，平均每年增产七百二十七万五千吨。而美国在同时期内却减少了七千八百万吨，平均每年减产一百九十五万吨。
    美国的采煤量虽然在某些时候也有些增长，但是增长的速度比苏联要缓慢得多，绝对增产量在最近几年也大大少于苏联。例如，过去四年美国的产煤量平均每年增加五百七十万吨，每年的增产速度平均是1.3％。而苏联在同一时期中每年的绝对增产量则是三千零六十万吨，每年的平均增长速度是9.7％。
    苏联的煤矿数量不断地增长着。在最近七年中，苏联建立了五百个煤矿和露天煤矿。今年，苏联还将有总生产能力为三千七百五十万吨的新煤矿投入生产。由于采煤基地的不断发展，苏联煤矿的年产量在今后十五年内将增加到六亿五千万吨到七亿五千万吨，即超过目前美国的采煤水平约50％。
