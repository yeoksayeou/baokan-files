Grasp Production with One Hand, Grasp Life with the Other
    Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory's 10,000-Person Canteen Is Well-Run

    (Our Dispatch from Chongqing, November 20th) The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory grasps production with one hand and the lives of its workers with the other, and its canteen is run very well. Recently, the Ministry of Labor specifically organized labor bureau chiefs from many provinces and cities to come and visit, and they unanimously agreed that the factory's practice of organizing workers' production and organizing their lives simultaneously is very good.
    The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory's canteen is a large canteen where about 10,000 people eat. In the past few years, many food management personnel have believed that "it is difficult to run a large factory canteen." This conservative thinking has prevented food service work from keeping up with the development of production for a long time. Since the second half of this year, the factory's Party committee has gradually clarified the importance of grasping production with one hand and the lives of the workers with the other. While arranging and inspecting production work, they have seriously grasped the work of the canteen. The Party committee first made a specific analysis and study of the 15,000 opinions that the workers had put forward about the canteen work during the blooming and contending period, and specially appointed a factory director to lead the canteen work. They first launched a debate among the cadres managing welfare on "Can a large canteen be run well?" and criticized the past tendency of not going deep into the kitchen and not paying attention to grasping the food service work. The factory director spent two and a half days each week personally participating in the cooking work, eating and laboring together with the cooks, and leading them to launch a mass blooming, mass contending and mass debate on "For whom are we laboring?" and "Does cooking work have a future?". The cooks changed their views on cooking work and unanimously believed that cooking work, like the workers in the production workshop, is serving the construction of socialism.
    On this basis, the factory's Party committee further led the cooks to break down many unreasonable rules and regulations in the canteen work, and implemented many new systems such as delivering meal tickets to the table and unattended meal and dish sales. When production tasks were busy, they also delivered food and dishes to the workshops for the workers to eat. The cooks promoted the practice of making fine food from coarse grains and launched a movement to innovate vegetable varieties so that the workers could eat delicious and palatable vegetables of various colors.
    The number of workers in this factory has increased significantly in the second half of this year. Due to the improvement of the cooking work, the tense phenomena such as queuing and crowding have been eliminated, and the relationship between the production workers and the cooks is very close.

    一手抓生产　一手抓生活
    重庆建设机床厂万人食堂办得好
    本报重庆20日电　重庆建设机床厂一手抓生产，一手抓职工生活，把食堂办得很出色。最近，劳动部特地组织了许多省、市的劳动厅、局长前来参观，一致认为这个厂组织职工生产与组织生活同时并举的作法很好。
    重庆建设机床厂的食堂是一个有一万人左右搭伙的大食堂。几年来，不少伙食管理人员都认为“大厂食堂不好搞。”这种保守思想使伙食工作长久以来不能跟上生产的发展。今年下半年以来，这个厂的党委便逐步明确一手抓生产、一手抓生活的重要，在布置、检查生产工作的同时，认真地抓了食堂工作。党委首先将职工在鸣放中对食堂工作提的一万五千条意见作了具体分析、研究，专门指定了一位厂长领导食堂工作。他们首先在管理生活福利的干部中展开了“大食堂能不能办好”的辩论，批判了过去不深入厨房，不重视抓伙食工作的偏向。厂长每周花两个半天时间亲自参加炊事工作，同厨工同吃同劳动，领导他们展开了“为谁劳动”和“炊事工作有无前途”的大鸣大放大辩论。炊事员转变了对炊事工作的看法，一致认为炊事工作与生产车间的工人一样，都是为建设社会主义服务。
    在这个基础上，厂党委进一步领导炊事员们破除了食堂工作上许多不合理的规章制度，实行了饭票送上餐桌和无人售饭、售菜等许多新的制度。在生产任务繁忙的时候，他们还把饭、菜送到车间给工人们吃。炊事员们推行粗粮细做，开展了革新蔬菜品种的运动，使职工们能吃到味美可口的各色蔬菜。
    这个厂今年下半年职工增加很多，由于炊事工作的改进，消除了排队、挤购等紧张现象，生产工人与炊事员的关系十分密切。
