    Semi-Monthly International Review
    ——November 1 to 15
    Nuclear Test Ban Conference at a Standstill
    Negotiations on the issue of halting nuclear weapons tests, a matter of concern to people of all countries, have made no progress due to obstruction by the United States and Britain. Although the United States and Britain, under pressure from world public opinion, agreed to hold talks in Geneva on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests by the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain starting from October 31, the facts of the past half-month have proved that the purpose of the United States and Britain in participating in the negotiations is not to satisfy the wishes of the people of the world in reaching an agreement to stop nuclear weapons tests, but to conspire to sabotage the negotiations and shift the responsibility for the failure to stop nuclear weapons tests onto the Soviet Union.
    On the second day of the opening of the Geneva Nuclear Test Ban Conference, the United States and Britain used their voting machine in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to reject the Soviet proposal for a permanent cessation of nuclear weapons tests, and forcibly passed the so-called "Seventeen-Nation Proposal." The part of the US-British proposal concerning the cessation of nuclear weapons tests does not clearly stipulate the cessation of tests, but emphasizes "stopping nuclear weapons tests under effective international supervision," which is in fact a replica of the absurd plan of "conditionally suspending tests for one year" that the United States and Britain have insisted on in the past.
    Since the Geneva Eight-Nation Nuclear Experts Conference in August, in which experts from the United States and Britain participated, shattered the absurd excuse that the United States and Britain had always insisted on that "nuclear tests cannot be supervised," the United States and Britain have been unable to continue to make a fuss about the issue of "whether" supervision is possible. In recent months, they have been entangled in the issue of whether supervision is "effective." During the Geneva Experts Conference in August, they refused to discuss the issue of concluding a nuclear test ban treaty, saying that it should be discussed specifically in the future; however, now that a special conference has been convened to study the issue of concluding a treaty, they insist that the task of this conference is still to study the issue of supervision, rather than concluding a treaty. The United States and Britain, while holding the Geneva Nuclear Test Ban Conference, forcibly passed the "Seventeen-Nation Proposal," attempting to steal the name of the United Nations resolution to pressure the Soviet Union to agree to a fictitious, vague, and boundless discussion of the concept of "effective," which can only result in the indefinite delay of the negotiations and the impossibility of reaching a nuclear test ban agreement.
    The lack of sincerity of the United States and Britain in stopping nuclear weapons tests can also be seen from the fact that they recently used the excuse that the Soviet Union continued to conduct nuclear tests after October 31, threatening to cancel their previously announced promise to suspend tests for one year from October 31. This excuse of the United States and Britain is obviously just a trick to cover up their unwillingness to reach a nuclear test ban agreement. Because they conducted a large-scale series of tests during a period when the Soviet Union unilaterally stopped testing, and they still resolutely reject the Soviet proposal to conclude a permanent nuclear test ban treaty. Under such circumstances, it was only right for the Soviet Union to announce in September this year that it would resume nuclear weapons tests in order to ensure its own security, and even Dulles had to admit that the Soviet Union's resumption of tests was "not blameworthy."
    It is precisely because the United States and Britain entered the conference with this conspiracy to sabotage the negotiations and blame the Soviet Union that the current Geneva negotiations have reached a stalemate. Due to concern about the opposition of the people of the world, the United States and Britain do not dare to rashly end the negotiations for the time being, but the actions of the United States and Britain have shown that they are actively sabotaging them. The people of all countries must pay close attention and not allow the conspiracy of US and British imperialism to be realized.
    The Struggle of the Japanese People Against the Kishi Government's Reactionary Policies
    Recently, the struggle of the Japanese people against the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government is developing on an unprecedented scale. This struggle erupted over the issue of amending the "Police Duties Execution Law."
    The Kishi Nobusuke government, willingly acting as a tool of American aggression, in order to revive Japanese militarism and tie Japan firmly to the American chariot, proposed an amendment to the "Police Duties Execution Law" in early October while revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty" to expand police power without restriction and rebuild a police state. The amendment to the "Police Law" means that the Japanese reactionary government is stepping up suppression, further depriving the people of their democratic rights, and legalizing preventive arrests, detentions, interference in gatherings, and mobilization of the Self-Defense Forces for suppression actions. The reason why the Kishi Nobusuke government wants to pass this bill by any means is to prepare for revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and amending the Constitution.
    The Kishi Nobusuke government and the US government have been holding negotiations in Tokyo since early October on the issue of revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty." This revision is actually to turn the US-Japan "Security Treaty" into a "bilateral" US-Japan military treaty of the nature of a "common defense treaty." According to sources close to the Kishi Nobusuke government, the revised US-Japan treaty will grant the United States the legal right to militarily control Japan: the United States can use the name of "defending Japan" to occupy Japanese military bases for a long time, making Japan a base for the United States to carry out aggression against China and Asia; and send Japanese troops to Taiwan and any region in the "Western Pacific region" of our country to act as accomplices in American military aggression. Recently, Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke has repeatedly clamored to abolish the Japanese constitutional provisions prohibiting the dispatch of troops abroad, and to "cooperate with the United States in every possible way," which is the reason. Kishi Nobusuke knows that this latent imperialist policy will inevitably arouse strong opposition from the Japanese people, so he has taken pre-emptive measures, attempting to first pass the amendment to the "Police Duties Execution Law," deprive the Japanese people of their basic human rights, and prepare a legal basis for further suppressing the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-fascist struggle.
    However, the Japanese people have suffered deeply from the aggressive wars launched by the militarists, and their memories are still fresh. They resolutely oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government reviving Japanese militarism and risking their lives for the sake of American imperialism. Therefore, on October 8, as soon as the Kishi government's Japanese Diet Provisional Session proposed the amendment to the "Police Law," it was immediately met with angry condemnation inside and outside the Diet.
    Starting in mid-October, a movement against the Kishi Nobusuke government centered on opposing the amendment to the "Police Law" not only developed rapidly among the working people, but also expanded to Japanese intellectuals and the cultural and artistic circles. Even within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, many enlightened people expressed dissatisfaction with Kishi Nobusuke's reactionary policies. For a month, mass rallies, strikes, and demonstrations against the Kishi government's amendment to the "Police Law" have been rising one after another with great momentum. November 5 was "National Unity Action Day" when the Japanese people mobilized en masse to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government. More than 5.5 million workers belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-Japan Trade Union Conference, the National Federation of Industrial Unions, and neutral system trade unions launched the largest-scale strength struggle since the war in various parts of Japan, opposing the Kishi government's amendment to the "Police Law." More than 60 Japanese peasant, youth, women's organizations, scientists, cultural figures, and news and broadcasting workers' groups have also joined this battle.
    Due to the strong opposition of the people throughout the country, the Kishi government was unable to pass the amendment to the "Police Law" and other reactionary bills during this Diet session. Therefore, the Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on November 4, used crude means in violation of the Diet agenda to forcibly pass a resolution to extend the Diet provisional session by 30 days (until December 7).
    The Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party's despicable acts have further angered the Japanese people, making the struggle against the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government even higher. At present, in about nearly 30 prefectural units in Japan's two prefectures and 42 counties, joint struggle organizations including the Socialist Party and the Communist Party have been established, and based on the unified action of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, they are actively launching struggles against amending the "Police Law," demanding the opening of Japan-China relations, demanding the dissolution of the Diet, and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.
    American People Spurn Republican Reactionary Policies
    On November 4, the United States held congressional and local elections, and the result was a disastrous defeat for the ruling Republican Party. The Republican Party was left with only a little more than one-third of the seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and less than one-third of the governorships. Several states in the eastern, midwestern, and western United States, which have always been Republican strongholds, were also lost to the Democratic Party this time. For example, in California, the stronghold of Republican leaders Nixon and Knowland, the governorship, which had been held by the Republican Party for 16 years, was taken away by the Democrats.
    The Republican Party's disastrous defeat is inseparable from the failure of the Eisenhower government's reactionary domestic and foreign policies. First of all, on the issue of the economic crisis, which is the most threatening to the American people, the basic policy of the Eisenhower government is to carry out a frenzied arms race, hoping to stimulate production "prosperity" with a large number of military orders and alleviate the economic crisis. This reactionary policy can only bring about the opposite result: the economic crisis is not alleviated, but deepened. Huge military expenditures have caused the US budget deficit for this year to be as high as 12.2 billion US dollars, causing inflation, devaluation of the US dollar, rising prices, and a continuous decline in the living standards of the people. In addition to some military industries, the vast majority of civilian industries have been unable to sell their products due to the shrinking purchasing power of the people, and have had to reduce their operating rates and lay off large numbers of workers. The number of unemployed people in the United States currently reaches 4.1 million, which is the official statistic, and the actual number is far more than that; as for the number of semi-employed people, the American "Workers' Weekly" estimates that it is more than 12 million. In the face of such a severe economic crisis, the Eisenhower government still talks about "prosperity," but in reality, it is doing its best to protect the interests of big capitalists and transfer the burden of the crisis to ordinary people.
    On the issue of peace, which the American people are very concerned about, the Eisenhower government completely ignores the wishes of the people and implements a "brink of war" policy, making the American people farther and farther away from peace and closer and closer to war. In recent years, the US government has provoked and taken risks everywhere in the world, and has failed everywhere; this bankrupt "brink of war" policy has caused the United States' prestige to decline rapidly, and the American people are worried day and night. In particular, this year's aggressive and adventurous actions in Lebanon and the Taiwan Strait have created an unprecedented situation of international isolation for the United States.
    The Republican government's reactionary domestic and foreign policies, which run counter to the wishes of the American people, can of course only cause strong dissatisfaction and opposition from the American people. In fact, the American people's dissatisfaction had already been fully expressed before the election; Dulles' war provocations in the Taiwan Strait aroused a huge storm of protests in the United States, which is proof. Therefore, although Eisenhower and Nixon personally went to various parts of the country to campaign for the Republicans, American voters still used the method of voting for the Democrats to show their rejection of the Republicans.
    Of course, due to the hypocrisy of the American bourgeois democratic system, the results of this American election cannot possibly cause the American ruling group to change its policies. There is originally no fundamental difference between the policies of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, and besides, the Republican Party will still be the ruling party in the next two years. However, since the Democratic Party has benefited from the voters' rejection of the Republican Party in this election and achieved victory, in order to further win the presidential and congressional elections in 1960, it will engage in more entanglement with the Republican Party in some practices and steps in the future; and in view of the disastrous defeat in this election, the Republican Party will have to devote more efforts to win over the people in the future, attempting to reverse the decline in the next election. Now, American newspapers have reported that Dulles will change his "tactics" in foreign affairs. This situation shows that: the Eisenhower government will be subject to more constraints and encounter greater difficulties in promoting its reactionary domestic and foreign policies in the next two years.

    半月国际述评
    ——11月1日至15日
    停止核试验会议陷入僵局
    各国人民所关心的停止核武器试验问题的谈判，由于美英两国的阻挠，至今毫无进展。美英两国在世界舆论的压力下，虽然同意从10月31日起在日内瓦举行苏美英三国关于停止试验核武器的谈判，但是半个月来的事实证明，美英两国参加谈判的目的，不是为了满足世界人民的愿望以达成停止核武器试验的协议，而是阴谋破坏谈判，并把核武器试验不能停止的责任推到苏联身上。
    在日内瓦的停止核武器试验会议开幕的第二天，美英两国就运用表决机器在联合国大会政治委员会拒绝苏联的永远停止核武器试验的提案，强行通过所谓“十七国提案”。美英提案中关于停止核武器试验的部分，不明确规定停止试验，而强调“在有效的国际监督下停止核武器试验”，这事实上就是美英过去所坚持的“有条件地暂停试验一年”的荒谬方案的翻版。
    自从今年8月间的有美英两国专家参加的日内瓦八国核专家会议粉碎了美英两国一向坚持的“无法监督核试验”的荒谬借口后，美英无法继续在“能否”监督的问题上做文章，最近几月来便一直在监督“有效”与否的问题上进行纠缠。它们在8月间日内瓦专家会议的时候，拒绝就缔结停止核武器试验协定的问题进行讨论，说是应当在将来专门讨论；但是，现在召开专门的会议来研究缔结协定的问题了，它们又硬说这次会议的任务还是要研究监督的问题，而不是缔结协定。美英在日内瓦停止核武器试验会议举行的同时，强行通过“十七国提案”，就是企图盗用联合国决议的名义来压迫苏联同意对“有效”这一概念进行一场虚幻飘渺、漫无边际的讨论，其结果只能是使谈判无限制地拖延下去，不可能达成停止核武器试验的协议。
    美英两国对停止核武器试验毫无诚意，也可以从它们最近借口苏联在10月31日以后继续进行核试验，威胁着要取消它们自己先前所宣布的从10月31日起停止试验一年的诺言这个事实看得出来。美英这种借口，显然只是为了掩饰它们无意达成停止核武器试验协定而玩弄的一种手法。因为它们曾经在苏联单方面停止试验的一段时期，进行了大规模的一系列试验，并且至今它们仍然坚决拒绝苏联提出的缔结一项永远停止核试验协定的建议。在这种情况下，苏联为了确保自己的安全，在今年9月间宣布恢复核武器试验，是理所应当的，就是杜勒斯也不得不承认苏联的恢复试验是“不能指责”的。
    正因为美英两国是怀抱着这种破坏谈判、嫁祸苏联的阴谋而进入会场的，所以目前的日内瓦谈判已陷入僵局。由于顾忌世界人民的反对，美英一时还不敢贸然中止谈判，然而美英两国的所作所为已经表明它们是在进行积极破坏。各国人民必须予以密切注意，不让美英帝国主义的阴谋实现。
    日本人民反对岸政府反动政策的斗争
    最近，日本人民反对岸信介政府反动政策的斗争，正以空前的规模发展着。这场斗争是在反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的问题上爆发起来的。
    甘心充当美国侵略工具的岸信介政府，为了复活日本军国主义，把日本牢牢地缚在美国的战车上，10月初在修改日美“安全条约”的同时，提出了“警察官职务执行法”修正案来无限制地扩大警察权力，重建警察国家。“警察法”的修改，意味着日本反动政府加紧进行镇压，进一步剥夺人民的民主权利，使预防性逮捕、拘禁、干涉集会、动员自卫队等镇压行动都成为合法。岸信介政府所以要不择手段地通过这项法案，就是为修改日美“安全条约”和修改宪法做准备。
    岸信介政府同美国政府从10月初起，就在东京进行了修改日美“安全条约”问题的谈判。这次修改，实际上是要把日美“安全条约”变成“共同防御条约”性质的“双边”的日美军事条约。据接近岸信介政府的人士透露，修改后的日美条约将给予美国在军事上控制日本的合法权利：美国可以利用“保卫日本”的名义，长期霸占日本的军事基地，使日本成为美国对中国和亚洲进行侵略的基地；把日本军队派到我国的台湾和“西太平洋区域”的任何地区，充当美国军事侵略的帮凶。最近日本首相岸信介不断叫嚷要废除禁止派兵出国的日本宪法条款，“尽一切可能的办法同美国进行合作”，就是这个道理。岸信介自知这种潜在帝国主义政策，必然会引起日本人民的强烈反对，因而他采取先发制人的手段，企图首先通过“警察官职务执行法”的修正案，剥夺日本人民的基本人权，并为进一步镇压日本人民的反美反法西斯斗争准备法律根据。
    但是，日本人民深受军国主义者发动侵略战争的祸害，迄今记忆犹新。他们坚决反对岸信介政府复活日本军国主义，为美帝国主义火中取栗。因此，10月8日，岸政府的日本国会临时会议刚一提出“警察法”的修正案，立刻遭到国会内外的愤怒谴责。
    从10月中旬开始，一个以反对修改“警察法”为中心的反对岸信介政府的运动，不仅在劳动人民中间迅速展开，而且扩大到日本的知识分子和文化艺术界，甚至在执政的自由民主党内部，也有不少有识之士，对岸信介的反动政策表示不满。一个月来，反对岸政府修改“警察法”的群众集会、罢工和示威游行此伏彼起，声势浩大。11月5日是日本人民全民总动员起来打倒岸信介政府的“国民统一行动日”。日本工会总评议会、全日本工会会议、全国产业别工会联合会和中立系统工会所属的五百五十多万工人，在日本全国各地展开了战后规模最大的一次实力斗争，反对岸政府修改“警察法”。日本六十多个农民、青年、妇女组织，科学家、文化界人士、新闻和广播工作者团体，也都投入了这个战斗。
    由于全国人民的强烈反对，岸政府无法在这次国会期中通过修改“警察法”等反动法案。于是岸政府和执政的自由民主党就在11月4日的众议院全体会议上，用违反国会议程的粗暴手段，强行通过把国会临时会议延长三十天（到12月7日为止）的决议。
    岸政府和自由民主党的卑鄙勾当更加激怒了日本人民，使反对岸信介政府反动政策的斗争更加高涨。目前，在日本全国二个府和四十二个县当中，已有约近三十个府县单位成立了包括社会党和共产党在内的共同斗争组织，并以社会党和共产党的统一行动为基础，积极展开反对修改“警察法”、要求打开日中关系、要求解散国会和打倒岸信介内阁的斗争。
    美国人民唾弃共和党反动政策
    11月4日美国进行了国会和地方选举，结果是执政的共和党遭到惨重失败。共和党在参众两院的席位都只剩下三分之一多一点，州长席位则连三分之一都不到。美国的东部、中西部和西部的若干州，一向是共和党的势力范围，这次也丧失给了民主党。例如，在共和党首脑人物尼克松和诺兰的老巢加利福尼亚州，共和党把持了十六年之久的州长席位，就被民主党人夺走了。
    共和党遭到这样的惨败，同艾森豪威尔政府的内外反动政策的失败是分不开的。首先，在美国人民最感到威胁的经济危机问题上，艾森豪威尔政府的基本政策是进行疯狂的扩军备战，期望用大批的军事定货来刺激生产的“繁荣”，缓和经济危机。这种反动政策只能带来适得其反的结果：经济危机不是有所缓和，而是更加深刻。巨大的军费开支，使得美国本年度预算赤字高达一百二十二亿美元，引起了通货膨胀，美元贬值，物价上涨，人民生活水平不断下降。除了一些军事工业之外，绝大多数的民用工业由于人民购买力的紧缩而产品滞销，不得不降低开工率，大批解雇工人。美国目前失业人数达四百一十万，这是官方的统计，实际上远不止此数；至于半失业人数，据美国“工人周报”估计，达一千二百万以上。在这样严重的经济危机面前，艾森豪威尔政府依然空谈“繁荣”，实际上所作的是竭力保护大资本家的利益，而把危机的重担转嫁到普通人民的身上。
    在美国人民十分关心的和平问题上，艾森豪威尔政府根本漠视人民的愿望，执行着“战争边缘”政策，使美国人民离和平越来越远，而离战争则越来越近。几年来美国政府在全世界各地到处挑衅，到处冒险，也到处失败；这种破产的“战争边缘”政策使美国威信迅速下降，使美国人民日夜提心吊胆。特别是今年在黎巴嫩和台湾海峡的侵略冒险行动，造成美国在国际上的空前孤立的局面。
    共和党政府的这种与美国人民的愿望背道而驰的内外反动政策，当然只能引起美国人民的强烈不满和反对。事实上，美国人民的不满情绪，早在选举之前就已经充分表露；杜勒斯在台湾海峡的战争挑衅，激起了美国国内的巨大抗议风暴，就是一个证明。因此，尽管艾森豪威尔和尼克松亲自到全国各地为共和党人竞选，美国选民还是用投票给民主党人的办法来表明他们对共和党的唾弃。
    当然，由于美国资产阶级民主制度的虚伪性，这次美国选举的结果并不可能使美国统治集团改变政策。民主党和共和党的政策原本就没有什么根本区别，何况在今后两年中共和党依然是执政党。不过，民主党既然在这次选举中沾了选民唾弃共和党之光而取得了胜利，那么，为了进一步取得1960年的总统和国会选举的胜利，今后会在一些做法上和步调上向共和党进行更多的纠缠；而共和党鉴于这次选举的惨败，今后也不能不更多地致力于笼络人心，企图在下一次选举中挽回颓势。现在，美国报纸已经传出消息说，杜勒斯在外交事务方面将改变“战术”。这种情况说明了：艾森豪威尔政府在今后两年中推行它的内外反动政策时，将受到更多的牵制，遇到更大的困难。
