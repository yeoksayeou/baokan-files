    "Second Lieutenant" Furnace Worker
    By our reporter Ye Jianyun

    I.
    Four months ago, when Cao Ying was still a Second Lieutenant platoon leader, his regimental commander came to inspect the troops. He looked at this junior officer with a round waist, broad shoulders, and great strength, and couldn't help but say with delight: "Great! Carrying 150 catties is no problem." At the time, the instructor casually interjected: "Isn't there a big push for water conservancy construction in the countryside? If we send our old Cao out, ha, even the best young men won't be able to beat him."
    That night, a shadow-like thought flickered in Cao Ying's mind: "Go to the countryside!" As soon as this thought appeared, he immediately began to restrain himself. "That's just wishful thinking. I'm an active-duty officer, how can I think about that!" Cao Ying joined the Party in 1945 and enlisted in the army soon after. The war and rigorous military life had cultivated in him a habit of paying attention to restraining himself at all times and in all places. He knew that a person's thoughts sometimes inevitably go wrong; but when a wrong thought just emerges, immediately trying to stop it, that way a person can make fewer mistakes. But this thought that had just flickered in his mind, he couldn't extinguish it no matter what.
    One day, he had just returned from duty when the instructor said he wanted to talk to him about something.
    "The higher-ups have ordered a batch of people to transfer to the economic front, and you are one of them." Cao Ying looked at the instructor's serious face. Obviously, this wasn't something he was saying casually.
    People are like this: when they want to do something, their interest is great, but once they really have to do it, they hesitate. Seeing that he had been silent for a long time without saying a word, the instructor said a few amusing words.
    "Do you know what you're going to do? A good job, going to an egg-processing factory. People say an egg breaks against a stone, now the egg is going to break against your iron egg."
    The instructor originally wanted to arouse his interest. Unexpectedly, Cao Ying, who was standing on the side, heard this and said in a rough voice:
    "I picked up a gun at the age of twenty-two, and I never thought I'd be holding it for twelve years. Now I have to change hands and touch machines. It's a bit incomprehensible at first, but when I think about it carefully, it's not surprising. But there's one thing: if I'm going, I have to go to a difficult place. An egg-processing factory is a job for women."
    The instructor smiled at him, "We can't decide this. Of course, your opinion can be reported to the higher-ups."

    II.
    On April 16, Cao Ying arrived at the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant with a backpack. The head of the personnel department looked at the letter of introduction, shook his hand tightly, and said repeatedly:
    "That's great, we welcome you so much! An old comrade, after all. How about going to the steelmaking workshop?"
    "I'm here to work, so wherever the work is heavy and tiring, that's where I'll go!"
    Cao Ying came to the iron smelting workshop. Chen Weimin, the deputy director of the workshop, looked him up and down, scratched his head, and after a long time, said: "The batching yard is short of a weighmaster. Start with that first, and if it's not suitable, we'll talk about it later!"
    Cao Ying had never been in a factory before. He had no idea about what any of the jobs were. So he replied vaguely: "Okay, I don't know anything, so I have to recognize a master!"
    Old Chen smiled at him. "You don't need a master."
    In the afternoon, Cao Ying went to work with great enthusiasm. Before he even got to the batching yard, several workers were pointing and talking about him. "Don't you know him? This is the new weighmaster. He just came down from the army. I heard he's still a Second Lieutenant platoon leader!" He lowered his head and walked behind a row of single men's dormitories to the batching yard.
    When he got to the weighmaster's post, someone gave him a notebook, a pencil, and an abacus. They even brought a chair and put it next to him. He understood everything. "The weighmaster is in charge of this. Hey! They're treating me like a disabled soldier!"
    After work, he looked everywhere for Chen Weimin, only to find that Old Chen was also looking for him. The two of them ran into each other at the factory gate.
    "Let me ask you, how many kinds of jobs are there in the iron smelting workshop? Who should be assigned to the weighmaster's job?"
    "What's wrong?" Old Chen saw that he looked unhappy and tried to persuade him. "This job is a little trivial. Be patient and do it for now. We'll transfer you up when the workshop office is set up!"
    "Transfer me up? Where else are you going to transfer me to? I'm sitting in a chair to work now. Are you going to have me lying on a sofa in the future?"
    "What do you want?"
    "For me, it's simple. I'm here to make steel, not to be in a sanatorium."
    "Oh, that's what it is." Chen Weimin understood the situation and couldn't help but feel a sense of respect for him. "That's easy to handle. However, we have to make things clear. We assigned you to weigh because we wanted to take care of you. You're an officer, and we took into consideration that you're getting on in years..."
    Cao Ying reached out and touched his beard and tidied his messy hair. He thought to himself, "Thirty-four years old, considered old? That's almost thirty years from now."
    He got a haircut and shaved that night. The next morning, he went to find Chen Weimin again.

    III.
    When Cao Ying arrived at No. 4 blast furnace, group leader Huang Wanling didn't assign him to be a furnace worker. As soon as he arrived, Old Huang pointed to the hot blast stove next to the blast furnace and said: "The temperature inside is very high. The four walls are often covered with coal ash, which needs to be cleaned regularly. Several people have been assigned to do it, but they all say it's too hot and they don't want to do it. There are only two Communist Party members on the furnace, you and me. We Party members can't fall behind if others don't want to do it."
    Cao Ying was very pleased to hear these words. He admired Huang Wanling for having the insight to recognize people and for identifying the right person.
    Cleaning the hot blast stove was hard work, but it didn't take long. After finishing, he would walk around the furnace. Whenever iron was tapped, he would carry the sledgehammer, iron bar, and mud bag to Huang Wanling. He helped make sand molds and clear the molten iron ditch. After tapping the iron, he would help clean up the yard. Huang Wanling was very annoyed with him, but he didn't want to drive him away. He was annoyed because Old Huang went wherever he went. He also loved to ask questions, and once he started asking, he wouldn't stop. For example, when Old Huang was looking at the color of the molten iron and saying that this was No. 00 iron, that was No. 1, and that was No. 2 and No. 3, Cao Ying would ask: "How do you know which number it is just by looking?" Old Huang said it was experience, you'll get it after looking at it a lot. Then he would follow up with questions about the characteristics of various types of iron. When Old Huang told him that No. 00 iron was pure white and shiny, No. 1 iron was slightly less shiny, No. 2 iron was shiny but slightly darker, and No. 3 iron was even darker, he would ask: "Why is it shiny? Why is it dark?" Old Huang was embarrassed. He said his master had never explained this principle. But Cao Ying still insisted on asking, "What exactly is the principle behind this?" He was a verbose person, and the reason Old Huang didn't drive him away was also because he felt that this person was very diligent. Many things that others didn't want to do, if assigned to him, he would never haggle.
    Soon, a furnace worker at No. 4 furnace got sick, and there weren't enough people when the iron was tapped. At this time, Cao Ying automatically ran to the furnace and started working. Probably Huang Wanling wanted to test him on purpose. The first time he worked at the furnace, he was asked to pierce the taphole. Old Huang stood by and said: "Calm down and be brave. Insert the iron bar fifty centimeters in, and lift the back end slightly."
    Cao Ying really started working. When the iron bar was inserted into the furnace, he felt both confused and scared. Recalling his state of mind at the time, it was somewhat similar to his first time on the battlefield.
    The taphole was opened, and molten iron flowed out. The bright, shiny molten iron flowed along the tapping trough in all directions. The burning sparks splashed everywhere, which looked a little scary. However, as the molten iron flowed more and more vigorously, he felt calmer in his heart.
    After the molten iron was drained, Old Huang shouted loudly: "Release the slag, plug the hole!" But he didn't understand at all. The red, shiny molten iron was still flowing, so why did he need to plug it? He stretched out his hands and asked Old Huang again. Old Huang waved his hand, his eyes wide. "Oh, what is this time? You still want a lecture." As he spoke, he threw a sandbag at the taphole. It was right on target, plugging it in one go.

    IV.
    In Cao Ying's view, he was an apprentice. In the eyes of the people on the furnace, he was still a Second Lieutenant platoon leader. This is how it started: one day, Xu Changchun took over Huang Wanling's shift. Old Huang had gone to a Party committee meeting, and the handover was entrusted to Cao Ying. Xu Changchun was a hardworking and conscientious person. But there was one thing: he liked to do everything himself. That day, after taking over the shift, he buried himself in tying iron, clearing slag, and burying sand molds, busy with this and that, so tired that he was covered in sweat. And what about the people in his shift? They were cooling off, smoking, and chatting in the aisle.
    That day, Cao Ying, in his capacity as the Party group leader, discussed with Xu Changchun the issue of leadership methods and division of labor. Later, with the specific help of the branch, Xu Changchun's leadership methods were greatly improved. The workers in Group B were very satisfied with this. They said: "Cao Ying is really capable. He saw the problem in our group at a glance. He has a lot of courage. He cured Xu Changchun in one go." Others said: "What's this? He used to lead soldiers. He could manage a platoon of more than thirty people, let alone a shift of eight or nine people."
    At the end of the month, Cao Ying was transferred to No. 1 furnace to be the first furnace worker. Coincidentally, group leader Wang Laifu was sick and hospitalized, and he was immediately asked to act as group leader. He was afraid he wouldn't be able to manage it, so he went to furnace technician Zhou Moyang and asked him to keep an eye on him. At this time, Zhou Moyang was looking at the wind eye on the furnace. After looking at it for a while, he asked Cao Ying to take a look too. Cao Ying put on his glasses and took a look, and couldn't help but be shocked. He immediately said in a flustered voice: "The water jacket is broken, and it's leaking badly!" Zhou Moyang said calmly:
    "What are you panicking about? When you should use your hands, don't use your mouth."
    Cao Ying calmed down, quickly removed the water pipe with a sledgehammer, and had another worker shovel a shovel of sand to plug the water pipe. The water jacket was replaced. All the movements were very skillful. A water jacket was replaced in ten minutes. When Cao Ying came down to the ground from the high place, Zhou Moyang looked at this skilled furnace worker with satisfaction and said softly: "Replacing a water jacket in ten minutes is a new record for this factory. From this point of view, you deserve to be the first furnace worker. However, here, you are a commander. No matter what happens, you shouldn't panic. If you panic, won't the people in the shift panic even more?" Cao Ying listened to this criticism and couldn't help but think of the scene of commanding operations in the past, "If the commander is not calm, how can he hold on!" His face flushed. "I just arrived at No. 1 furnace, and I haven't been able to support the facade alone. You have to come here more often in the future."
    "Well, if you are more calm on the basis of proficiency, it seems that everything can be handled." Zhou Moyang gave him a trusting look and left. ……

    One day, Cao Ying's regimental commander from the army came to Shijiazhuang on a business trip. Cao Ying went to see him. As soon as they met, the regimental commander asked: "Steel warrior, have you used all your strength? Tell me some心得 (insights/learnings)?" Cao Ying habitually stood at attention and replied: "My心得 (insights/learnings) are still the old words that the Party taught us: 'The more difficult the place, the more it can train people!'"

    “少尉”炉前工
    本报记者　叶剑韵
    一
    在四个月以前，当曹瑛还是一个少尉排长的时候，他的团首长到部队来视察，瞧了瞧这个腰圆肩宽，力气过人的下级军官，不禁欣喜地说：“真棒呀！担一百五十斤不成问题。”当时指导员随便插了一句：“农村不是大搞水利建设吗？如果派咱老曹出马，哈，上好的小伙子也赛不过他。”
    当天夜里，有个影子一样的念头在曹瑛脑子里闪忽了一下：“下农村去吧！”这个念头一出现，他马上就在克制自己。“真是胡思乱想，咱是现役军官，怎么可以想到那上头去哩！”曹瑛1945年入党后不久就参了军，经过战争和严格的军事生活的锻炼，使他养成了一种随时随地注意约束自己的习惯。他知道，一个人的思想，有时候难免会出错；但是，当一种错误的念头刚露头，马上就设法制止，这样人就可以少犯错误。可是刚在脑子里闪忽的这个念头，怎么样也扑灭不了。
    一天，他值勤刚回来，指导员说有事要找他谈谈。
    “上级命令，要一批人转业到经济战线上去，其中也有你。”曹瑛看看指导员那副严肃的面孔，显然，这不是随便说的。
    人就是这样，想干一件事情，兴趣大得很，一旦真的要他干起来，又会犹豫不决了。指导员见他沉默好久没吱声，就说几句有趣的话。
    “你知道去干嘛？好差事，到打蛋厂去，人家说鸡蛋碰石头，这下鸡蛋要碰你这个铁蛋了。”
    指导员本想引起他的兴趣。不料站在一旁的曹瑛，听了这一节以后，却粗声粗气地说：
    “二十二岁拿枪杆子，想不到摸了十二年，现在又要换手摸机器去了。猛一阵有点不通，仔细想想这也不奇怪。可就有一点，要去，就得到个艰苦的地方去，打蛋厂，这是妇女干的活儿。”
    指导员向他笑笑，“这个咱们是做不得主的，当然，你的意见可以向上级反映一下。”
    二
    4月16日，曹瑛背了只背包来到了石家庄钢铁厂。人事科长看了看介绍信，紧紧地握住他的手，连声不倒连声地说：
    “太好哪，咱太欢迎哪！老同志嘛。下钢铁车间怎么样？”
    “来就是干的，哪儿活重，哪儿累，咱就到哪去！”
    曹瑛来到炼铁车间，车间副主任陈维民在他身上打量了一番，搔搔头皮，过了好半天，才说：“配料场缺个司磅的，先干起来，不合适再说吧！”
    曹瑛没在工厂里呆过，这个工种哪个工种的，他根本闹不清。就含含糊糊地回说：“行，咱一窍不通，得认个师傅才行呀！”
    老陈向他笑笑。“没师傅也成。”
    下午，曹瑛兴致冲冲地上班去。没到配料场，就有几个工人指手划脚地在说他。“你不认识吗？这是新来的司磅员，部队刚下来，听说还是个少尉排长哩！”他低着头，从一排单身汉的宿舍后面，穿行到配料场去了。
    走上司磅员的岗位，就有人交给他一个本子，一支铅笔，一把算盘，还拿来了张椅子放到他身边。这一切他全明白了。“司磅员就是管这个的。嘿！他们把我当残废军人待哩！”
    下班以后，他到处找陈维民，谁知老陈也在找他。两个人在工厂门口碰上了。
    “咱问你，炼铁车间有多少种活儿，司磅员的活儿应该派谁干？”
    “怎么样，”老陈见他一脸的不高兴，就劝说道，“这活儿是琐碎一些，先耐着性子干吧，等车间办公室搞起来了，再调上来吧！”
    “调上来？还要调到什么地方去。现在坐在椅子上干活儿，将来难不成还要躺在沙发上？”
    “你要怎么样？”
    “我嘛，很简单，咱是来搞钢铁的，可不是来休养所。”
    “噢，原来是这么回事。”陈维民摸清了底细，不觉对他产生了一种敬意。“那好办。不过，咱得把话说清楚，派你去司磅，纯粹出于照顾。你嘛，是个军官，考虑到你的身体也上了几岁年纪了……”
    曹瑛伸手摸了一下胡子，又理了理乱蓬蓬的头发。心想：“三十四岁，算老，再过三十年差不多。”
    晚上回去理了个发，修了面，第二天一早又去找陈维民去了。
    三
    曹瑛到了四号高炉，组长黄万岭并没有分配给他作炉前工。他一到，老黄就指着高炉旁边的热风室说：“这里面温度很高，四壁经常会积满煤灰，需要人经常打扫。分配给几个人干过，他们都说热的受不了，不愿意干。炉子上就是你我两个共产党员，别人不干的，咱们党员可不能拉后。”
    这几句话，曹瑛听了很受用。他很佩服黄万岭有眼力，识人，是看准了对象的。
    清理热风炉活儿虽重，但劳动时间不长。干完了，他就到炉前来转转。逢上出铁，他就把大锤、铁钎子、泥包搬到黄万岭跟前。帮着做沙模、疏通铁水沟。出完铁，就帮助清理场子。黄万岭对他很厌烦，但又不愿意撵他。厌烦的是，老黄到那里，他就跟到那里。嘴巴又爱问，一问就没有个完。譬如老黄在看铁水的成色，说这是○○号铁，那是一号，那是二号三号。这时曹瑛就要问了：“怎么你一看就知道是几号几号的呢？”老黄说这是经验，看多了就成了。那么他就追问各种型号铁的标志。当老黄告诉他○○号铁是洁白闪光，一号铁光度稍差，二号铁虽闪光但稍黯，三号铁更黯的时候，他就追问；“为什么闪光，为什么发黯哩？”老黄窘了。他说他的师傅也没说过这个道理。可是曹瑛仍然要说，这里面究竟是个什么道理呢？这是个爱噜嗦的人，老黄所以没有撵他，也觉得这个人很勤快，许多事情，别人不愿意干的，派到他，一定不讲价钱。
    不久，四号炉有个炉前工生病，出铁的时候人手不够，这时曹瑛就自动跑到炉前干起活儿来了。大概是黄万岭有意考考他，第一次在炉前干活，就让他捅出铁工。老黄站在一旁说：“沉住气，壮起胆子来。铁钎子送进去五十公分，后面稍许翘高一点。”
    曹瑛真的干起来了。当铁钎子插进炉膛里去的时候，心里又乱又怕。他回想起当时的心境，有点和第一次上战场差不多。
    打开了出铁口子，铁水流出来了。亮闪闪的铁水，沿着出铁槽向四周奔流过去。灼热的火星子四处飞溅，看上去真有点怕人。然而当铁水流得越涌越猛的时候，他心里反而平静下来了。
    流完铁水，老黄在大声叫嚷：“放渣，堵口子！”可是他一点也不明白，红闪闪的铁水还在流动，为什么要堵起来哩？他伸直两手，又问起老黄来了。老黄手一摆，两眼瞪的溜圆。“咳，这是什么时候，还要讲经。”说着，顺手就向出铁口子抛去一个沙包。真准，一下就堵住了。
    四
    在曹瑛看来，自己是个学徒工，在炉子上的人看来，他还是一个少尉排长。事情是从这里开始的，一天，许长春接黄万岭的班，老黄到党委开会去了，交接班的事就委托给曹瑛了。许长春这人，肯干，办事挺认真。可就是有一点，什么事都喜欢自己动手。这一天，他接班以后，就一个人埋下头来扎铁，清渣，埋沙模，忙了这样忙那样，一个人累的满头大汗。他们班上的人哩！却在过道里凉快，抽烟聊天。
    这一天，曹瑛以党小组长的身分和许长春研究领导方法和工作分工的问题。后来，在支部的具体帮助下，许长春的领导方法有了很大的改进。对这件事，乙班的工人反映很满意。他们说：“人家曹瑛真有办法，一下就看出了咱们班的问题。魄力真不小，一下就治住了许长春。”另一些人说：“这算什么，人家带过兵，一个排三十多人都舞下来了，别说这一班八九个人。”
    月末，曹瑛调到一号炉上来当第一炉前工。碰巧组长王来福生病住医院去了，一下又要他代理组长。他怕舞不起来，就去找炉前技师周默扬，要他关照着点。这时，周默扬在炉子上看风眼，看了一回，他要曹瑛也看看。曹瑛戴上镜子一看，不禁吓了一跳，立即慌里慌张地说：“水套坏了，漏的挺厉害！”周默扬不动神色地说：
    “慌什么，该用手的时候，就不要用嘴。”
    曹瑛镇定了一下，用滑锤迅速退下了水管子，由另一个工人铲了一锹沙把水管子堵上。水套换下来了，一切动作都很娴熟，十分钟就换成了一副水套。曹瑛从高处下到地面的时候，周默扬满意地看了看这个操作熟练的炉前工轻轻地说：“十分钟换一副水套，这是本厂的新纪录；从这一点看，你配得上当个第一炉前工。可是，在这里，你是一个指挥员，发生了任何情况，也不该慌张。你一慌，班上的人不就更慌更乱了吗？”曹瑛听了这一段批评，不禁联想起过去指挥作战的情景，“指挥员不沉着，那怎么挺得住哩！”一下脸红了。“我刚到一炉，一个人没撑过门面，今后你得勤跑着点。”
    “这个嘛，如果在熟练的基础上再沉着些，看来一切是可以顶下来的。”周默扬向他投了个信任的眼光走了。…………
    一天，曹瑛在部队里的那位团首长出差到石家庄来了，曹瑛去看他，一见面团首长就问：“钢铁战士，劲儿全使上了吗？说点心得我听听？”曹瑛习惯地立了个正，回说：“心得嘛，还是党教导我们的那句老话：‘越艰苦的地方越能锻炼人’！”
