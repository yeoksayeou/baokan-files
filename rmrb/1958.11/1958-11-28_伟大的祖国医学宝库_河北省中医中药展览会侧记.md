Traditional Chinese medicine is a great treasure trove, containing countless rare and precious items. The recent Hebei Province Exhibition of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Herbs in Baoding tells us with vivid facts: Traditional Chinese medicine has not only made tremendous contributions to the survival and development of our nation, but also solved difficult problems in the treatment of various diseases, such as cirrhosis and bone tuberculosis, which are currently difficult to treat in the world, making outstanding contributions to world medicine.

	Life-Saving Miracles, Healing All Ailments

In September of this year, Bu Shuming, a male patient with a very large belly, was carried into the Xianxian County Puji Hospital. Bu Shuming had not had a bowel movement for five days, and he suffered from abdominal pain, vomiting, and cold limbs. Doctors diagnosed him with "mesenteric thrombosis." According to past literature, this disease was untreatable, but when the doctors saw the patient unconscious and the family members weeping, they decided to break with superstition and use traditional Chinese medicine to save the patient. That night, they used a folk secret recipe of soybean oil for treatment. The next day, his condition improved. After five days, Bu Shuming had a bowel movement and his spirits lifted. After half a month of soybean oil treatment, Bu Shuming walked out of the hospital. With tears in his eyes, he excitedly said to the hospital staff: "I was carried in and walked out, you are my reborn parents, my saviors, I will never forget you in this lifetime."

Words of sincere gratitude for the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine like Bu Shuming's can be heard everywhere. Miracles of traditional Chinese medicine rescuing critically ill patients and rapidly treating chronic diseases are endless.

From the 621 case records exhibited in the "Hall of Rejuvenation" at the exhibition, it is clear that traditional Chinese medicine can handle everything from internal medicine, gynecology, and pediatrics to surgery, ophthalmology, and otolaryngology with ease. Many diseases that Western medicine considers incurable have been cured by traditional Chinese medicine using internal Chinese medicine, acupuncture, cupping, qigong, and other therapies. Zhang Ruoping, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in the otolaryngology department of the Chengde Special District Affiliated Hospital, used methods of stopping bleeding and blood transfusions to rescue Li Man, a patient with severe nasal bleeding, but the bleeding did not stop after three days of treatment, and the patient was on the verge of death. However, Zhang Ruoping prescribed a dose of "Modified Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction," and the patient recovered after taking it. Li Jingshan, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Shenxian County, Shijiazhuang Special District, cured Feng Shuzong, a four-year-old boy, of rickets with "alfalfa and peanuts." Gao Yulan, a patient with optic atrophy, regained her sight thanks to the ophthalmology department of the Hebei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Traditional Chinese medicine is even more effective in treating epidemic Japanese encephalitis. Some people once thought that this was just the effect of a single prescription, and still had doubts and mistrust of traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, last year and this year, Tangshan Infectious Disease Hospital and Tianjin Infectious Disease Hospital respectively conducted comparative treatment of all encephalitis patients they admitted, using both traditional Chinese and Western medicine. As a result, the cure rate of traditional Chinese medicine at Tangshan Infectious Disease Hospital reached 100%, and the cure rate of traditional Chinese medicine in Tianjin reached 89.4%, and the treatment process was short, with few sequelae. The cure rates of Western medicine treatment in both infectious disease hospitals were not as good as traditional Chinese medicine.

	Unique Achievements in Abundance

Stepping into the "Satellite Hall" of the exhibition, the achievements of traditional Chinese medicine in curing various difficult and complicated diseases are dazzling, and make people feel extremely excited. This achievement marks that since the rectification movement, in the wave of breaking superstitions and liberating thought, and under the impact of the technological revolution, the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine has been further explored and has released a brilliant light.

The Tianjin Special District created the experience of "two no surgeries, two no amputations," using traditional Chinese medicine methods to treat obliterative thromboangiitis without amputation; treating intestinal obstruction without surgery; and treating acute appendicitis without surgery. Some areas use chicken bile to treat pertussis, "Yanghe Decoction" to treat bone tuberculosis, and acupuncture to treat "tinea" that Western medicine finds difficult to handle. These are all original. Traditional Chinese medicine has also conquered diseases for which Western medicine has no significant clinical effect, such as cirrhosis, peptic ulcers, cancer, burns, and syphilis.

The Zhangjiakou City Organ Clinic has cured many cirrhosis patients with traditional Chinese medicine in two years. Many of them had ineffective Western medicine treatment and serious conditions before turning to traditional Chinese medicine. Some patients had suffered from cirrhosis for ten years, and after taking traditional Chinese medicine, their ascites decreased and their condition gradually improved. Some people who were bedridden have now returned to work. There are various prescriptions for treating cirrhosis with traditional Chinese medicine. In Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin Special District and other places, some use "Gu Zhang San" for treatment, some use "Liver-Soothing and Blood-Activating Agent" for treatment, and some use red beans and carp for treatment. Many patients are grateful to the superb medicine of the motherland for saving their lives.

Chengde Special District has miraculous effects in treating syphilis with "Sanxian Dan" and "Qingxue Soudan Wan," not only curing patients with acquired syphilis, but also restoring the health of patients with congenital syphilis. Liu Fa, an elderly man in his fifties, suffered from late-stage acquired syphilis. His nose was ulcerated, his throat was so swollen that he could barely eat, and he was deaf. After being treated by Sheng Zizhang, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, and taking "Qingxue Soudan Wan" internally and two doses of "Sanxian Dan," his throat was no longer swollen, he could eat dry rice and corn buns, and the ulcers on his nose gradually healed. After taking the third dose of "Sanxian Dan," his throat and nose were cured, and he could hear the chickens crowing. After Liu Fa recovered, he felt energetic and rejoined the production labor force. Fan Dongqing, twenty-four years old, had syphilis since birth. His left leg was ulcerated and he could only limp for a little over half a kilometer. He sought medical treatment everywhere, but was considered incurable. But when Fan Dongqing took three doses of "Sanxian Dan," the ulcers on his leg healed and he was able to walk long distances. He also participated in agricultural production this spring.

Influenza, which is a great threat to the human body, and measles complicated by bronchitis, which has a high mortality rate, have also been conquered by traditional Chinese medicine. In Baoding Special District, acupuncture is used to treat influenza. Only the "Shaoshang," "Zhongshang," and "Laoshang" acupoints on the fingertips are pricked with needles. Among eighty patients, more than 80% were cured with one acupuncture treatment, and the effective rate was 100%. Xushui County and Rongcheng County used the Chinese herbal medicine "Guanzhong" to prevent influenza with good results. In one village, of the fifty or so patients with influenza, those who took "Guanzhong" internally saw their serious illnesses alleviated and their mild illnesses cured the next day. One agricultural cooperative in this village had eleven production teams. One production team did not take the medicine, and the epidemic continued to develop. After the other ten production teams took "Guanzhong," the epidemic stabilized and declined. Tangshan Infectious Disease Hospital used traditional Chinese medicines such as rash-promoting, detoxifying, and lung-clearing medicines to treat measles complicated by bronchitis. Among 148 patients, 136 were cured and discharged, which is a rare effect.

People suffering from scrofula (lymph node tuberculosis) often feel pain because of the deep-rooted nature of this disease. The Hebei Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic and Ningjin County Health and Epidemic Prevention Station have brought good news to these patients. Of the 22 patients accepted by the Ningjin County Health and Epidemic Prevention Station from 1956 to 1957 for six months, some had been ill for nine years, some had open wounds the size of a bowl, and some had nodules as large as apricots. After treatment with acupuncture, all of them recovered. The Hebei Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic also achieved preliminary results by first performing surgery and then using decay-removing and muscle-generating powder, externally applying purple gromwell ointment to treat scrofula.

	Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment, Flexible and Comprehensive

These "magical" medical facts are not accidental coincidences, but are guided by thousands of years of clinical experience and scientific theory in traditional Chinese medicine. The characteristic of traditional Chinese medicine treatment is "syndrome differentiation and treatment," which believes that "disease is not outside the human body, but within it." The good effect of traditional Chinese medicine in treating epidemic Japanese encephalitis over the years has been achieved under the guidance of the theory of syndrome differentiation and treatment. Before 1956, the treatment of encephalitis with "Baihu Decoction" achieved satisfactory results, and in 1956, patients were also cured with prescriptions such as "Sanren Decoction." Why can a disease be cured with different medicines? Zheng Yingzhou, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, said: "The name of the disease is not the basis for traditional Chinese medicine treatment. The principle of traditional Chinese medicine treatment lies in examining the development of the patient's condition and the impact of objective conditions on the patient. The climate in 1956 was more humid than before, so it is necessary to prescribe medicine according to the principle of 'partial dampness' and the specific situation of the patient, so that the medicine will definitely cure the disease." He said with great emotion: "Any treatment that is not based on these dialectical principles will not achieve satisfactory results, and may even be misdiagnosed." These principles show that traditional Chinese medicine is not an experience of one prescription and one medicine, but is guided by scientific theory.

When Qian Letian, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner at the Hebei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, treated three patients with acute appendicitis, due to the different causes, symptom changes, and patient resistance, he adopted different treatments even after taking the same medicine. For the patient surnamed Li, who had severe heat and rapid disease progression, he used more gypsum in the medicine. The patient surnamed Fu was weak and had had this disease for the third time, so he first used "fried salt" to warm the umbilicus to relieve qi and relieve pain, and then took the medicine. The patients quickly recovered under different treatments. Qian Letian said: "This is the characteristic of syndrome differentiation and treatment in traditional Chinese medicine. It is not possible to treat diseases with fixed prescriptions."

The exhibition gave visitors a vivid lesson in traditional Chinese medicine. People expressed in the guestbook that they must inherit and carry forward the medical heritage of the motherland, create a new national medicine, and let the medical brilliance of the motherland shine brightly and last for generations.

    伟大的祖国医学宝库
    ——河北省中医中药展览会侧记
    新华社记者　虞锡珪
    中国医药学是一个伟大的宝库，它蕴藏着数不尽的奇珍异宝。最近在保定举行的河北省中医中药展览会，用鲜明的事实告诉我们：祖国医药不仅为我国民族的生存和发展作出了巨大贡献，而且解决了目前世界上治疗尚感困难的肝硬变、骨结核等多种病症的疑难问题，为世界医学作出了卓越贡献。
      起死回生　万病回春
    今年9月，在献县普济医院里抬来了一位肚子很大的男性病人卜树明。卜树明已经五天没有大便了，他肚痛呕吐，四肢发凉，经医生诊断是“肠系膜血栓”。根据以往文献记载，这种病是没法治疗的，但是医生看到病人昏迷不醒，病人家属痛哭流涕时，决心破除迷信，用中医中药挽救病人。当晚，他们用民间秘方豆油治疗，第二天病情就见好转，五天以后，卜树明解下了大便，精神振作，经过半个月的豆油治疗，卜树明就步行出院了。他热泪盈眶激动地对医院工作人员说：“我是抬着来走着回去的，你们是我的再生父母、救命恩人，我这辈子也忘不了你们。”
    像卜树明这样对中医疗效衷心感激的话语，随处可以听到。中医抢救危在旦夕的病人，和医治慢性病疗效迅速的奇迹是层出不尽的。
    从展览会“回春馆”里展出的六百二十一个病例纪录中，显示出中医从内科、妇科、小儿科到外科、眼科、耳鼻喉科，都能应付自如，许多西医认为不能医治的病，却被中医用内服中药、针灸、拔火罐、气功等疗法治愈了。承德专区附属医院耳鼻喉科用止血、输血的办法抢救鼻腔大量出血的病人李满，治了三天鼻血仍未制止，病人奄奄一息；但是中医张若萍开了一剂“加味犀角地黄汤”，病人服后就好了。石家庄专区深县中医李景山用“苜蓿花生”治好了四岁男孩冯书宗的佝偻病。河北省中医研究院眼科中医使青盲症患者高玉兰重见光明。
    中医治疗流行性乙型脑炎功效更高。有人曾认为这仅仅是一方一剂之效，对中医还是怀疑、不信任。于是在去年和今年，唐山传染病院和天津传染病院分别在收治的全部脑炎患者中，进行了中西医对比治疗。结果，唐山传染病院中医的治愈率达到100％，天津的中医治愈率达到89.4％，而且治疗过程短，很少有后遗症。两个传染病院西医治疗的治愈率都比不上中医。
    独创成绩琳琅满目
    走进展览会的“卫星馆”，中医治好各种疑难病症的成绩琳琅满目，使人看了异常振奋。这成绩标志着从整风运动以来，在破除迷信、解放思想的浪潮里，在技术革命的冲击下，中医中药的宝库得到了进一步的发掘，放出了灿烂的光芒。
    天津专区创造了“两不开刀、两不截肢”的经验，用中医的办法治疗闭塞性脉管炎可以不用截肢；治疗肠梗阻可以不动手术；治疗急性阑尾炎可以不开刀等。有些地区用鸡苦胆治疗百日咳，用“阳和汤”治骨结核，用针灸治疗西医感到棘手的“癣”症等。这些都是富有独创性的。中医中药还攻下了西医临床治疗无显著效果的肝硬变、消化性溃疡和癌瘤、烫伤、梅毒等症。
    张家口市机关门诊部在两年的时间内，用中药医治好了许多肝硬变患者，其中不少人是经过西医治疗无效，病情严重，才转由中医治疗的。其中还有害肝硬变十年的患者，经过服用中药后，腹水随之减少，病情逐渐好转。有些人原来卧床不起，现在已重新走上工作岗位。中医治疗肝硬变的方剂是多种多样的，在唐山、石家庄、天津专区等地有用“臌胀散”治疗的，也有用“平肝活血剂”治疗的，还有用红小豆鲤鱼治疗的。很多病人感激祖国高超的医学挽救了他们的生命。
    承德专区以“三仙丹”和“清血搜毒丸”治疗梅毒有奇效，不仅治好了后天性梅毒患者，而且也使患先天性梅毒的病人恢复了健康。五十多岁的老人刘发患后天晚期梅毒，鼻子已经溃烂，嗓子肿得粒米难进，耳朵也聋了。后经中医盛子章治疗，内服“清血搜毒丸”和两剂“三仙丹”，嗓子不肿了，能吃干饭、窝头，鼻子溃烂处也逐渐愈合。服完第三剂“三仙丹”后，嗓子、鼻子都痊愈，两耳也能听见鸡叫。刘发病好了，觉得自己浑身是劲，又重新参加了生产劳动。二十四岁的范东清从生下来就患梅毒，左腿溃烂，只能跛行一里多路。他到处求医，却被认为不可救药。但是当范东清服了三剂“三仙丹”后，腿部溃烂治愈，并且能够走远路了。今年春天他也参加了农业生产。
    对人体威胁很大的流行性感冒和死亡率较高的麻疹并发支气管炎，也被中医治服了。保定专区用针灸治疗流行性感冒，只用针刺破手指头上的“少商”、“中商”、“老商”三个穴道，在八十个病人中，一次针刺治愈的即达80％以上，有效率百分之百。徐水县和容城县用中药“管仲”预防流行性感冒，效果很好。有一个村子五十多个患流行性感冒的病人中，凡是内服“管仲”的，第二天重病减轻，轻病痊愈。这个村子的一个农业社有十一个生产队，一个生产队没有服药，疫情继续发展，其他的十个生产队在服用“管仲”后，疫情都平稳下降了。唐山市传染病院用透疹、解毒、清肺等类中药，治疗麻疹并发支气管炎，一百四十八个病人中，有一百三十六人治愈出院，这样的疗效是很少见的。
    患瘰疬鼠疮（淋巴腺结核）的人，常为这种病的根深蒂固感到痛苦。河北省中医门诊部和宁津县卫生防疫站为这些病人送来了福音。宁津县卫生防疫站从1956年到1957年六个月接受的二十二个病人中，有的已得病九年，有的破伤有碗口大，有的结核大如杏核，经中医用针挑术治疗后，全部痊愈。河北省中医门诊部以先动手术，后用化腐生肌散，外贴紫草膏的方法治疗鼠疮，也取得初步疗效。
    辨证施治灵活全面
    这些“神奇”的医疗事实，并不是偶然的巧合，而是因为祖国医学有千年的临床经验和科学理论为指导。祖国医学治疗特点是“辩证施治”，它认为“病不在人之外，而在人身之中”。多年来中医治疗流行性乙型脑炎的良好效果，就是在辨证施治的理论指导下取得的。1956年以前，治疗脑炎用“白虎汤”收到了满意的效果，而1956年用“三仁汤”等方剂，也医治好了病人。为什么一种病用不同的药能治好呢？中医郑英洲说：“疾病的名字不是中医治病的根据，中医治病的原则在于考察病人病情的发展情形和客观条件给予病人的影响。1956年的气候比以前潮湿，因此必须按‘偏湿’的原则和病人的具体情况开方处药，这样定能药到病除。”他颇有感触地说：“任何不根据这些辩证的原则治病的，都不会收到满意效果，甚至误治。”这些道理，说明了中医并不是一方一药的经验，而是有科学理论作指导的。
    河北省中医研究院中医钱乐天在医治三个急性阑尾炎患者时，由于这三个病人的起病原因、症状变化和病人抵抗力的不同，在服用了同样的药后，还采取了不同的治法。姓李的病人热盛病剧，在药中就多用生石膏，姓傅的病人体弱，又是第三次得这种病，因此先用顺气止痛的“炒盐”暖脐，然后再吃药。病人在不同的治法下，很快都恢复了健康。钱乐天说：“这就是中医辩证施治的特点，用死药方治病是不行的。”
    展览会给参观的人上了一堂生动的祖国医学课程。人们纷纷在留言簿中表示，一定要继承发扬祖国的医学遗产，创造民族新医学，让祖国的医学光芒万丈、万世留芳。
