A Program for Advancing Towards Communism Soviet Seven-Year Plan ①

    Electricity Doubles, Petroleum and Gas Production Greatly Increases
    The main theme of the recently announced Soviet Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy is to develop the economy at a high speed and win time in the peaceful competition with the United States. Based on this, the plan stipulates that in the seven years from 1959 to 1965, the total industrial output value will increase by 80%, of which the production of means of production will increase by 85%-88%.
    Electricity
    In the next seven years (1959-1965), the scale of power station construction in the Soviet Union will be unprecedentedly huge. The total power generation capacity of power stations across the country will more than double, from the current 50 million kilowatts to about 110 million kilowatts. This means that in these seven years, the total power generation capacity of the new power stations to be built and put into production in the Soviet Union will exceed the sum of the total power generation capacity of all power stations built and put into production in the past forty years.
    The unprecedented large-scale power station construction will enable the Soviet Union's power output in 1965 to increase from 233 billion kilowatt-hours this year to 500 billion to 520 billion kilowatt-hours. By that time, the degree of electrification of the Soviet industrial production, which is now almost entirely electrified, will be further improved, electrified railway lines will increase by about 20,000 kilometers compared with now, and all state farms, agricultural technology repair stations, collective farms, and workers' residential areas across the country will be fully electrified. In this way, the Soviet Union will take a decisive step in realizing Lenin's ideal of complete electrification of the Soviet Union.
    During the Seven-Year Plan, the main direction of the Soviet Union's power industry development is: to give priority to the construction of thermal power stations to further accelerate the speed of power industry and national electrification development.
    In the past seven years, the total power generation capacity of Soviet thermal turbine power stations will increase by 1.3 to 1.4 times. Of the total new turbine power stations with a total power generation capacity of 58 million to 60 million kilowatts put into production across the country, thermal power stations will account for about four-fifths. Among thermal power stations, emphasis will be placed on building power stations equipped with steam turbine generator sets with a power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts to 300,000 kilowatts. At present, the Soviet Union is already designing 230 such thermal power stations. Among them, the power generation capacity of 30 power stations will exceed 1 million kilowatts. By 1965, the Soviet Union will have built more than 20 thermal power stations with a power generation capacity of 1 million to 2 million kilowatts.
    The Soviet Union will also build a giant thermal power station with a power generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts in the next few years. This will be the largest thermal power station in the world, and it will be equipped with steam turbines with a power generation capacity of 600,000 kilowatts. It is reported that the United States also intends to manufacture giant steam turbines in the next few years, but the largest power generation capacity is only 450,000 kilowatts.
    Hydropower station construction will also be carried out. The Stalingrad, Kremenchug, Votkinsk, and Bukhtarma hydropower stations currently under construction, as well as the world's largest Bratsk hydropower station, will be completed and put into production in the next few years. In addition, emphasis will be placed on starting the construction of some new hydropower stations in some areas of the country that lack cheap fuel. At the same time, some nuclear power stations will also be built. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Petroleum and Gas
    In terms of fuel needed by the national economy, there will be considerable changes in the next seven years. Since the Soviet Union has very rich oil and gas resources, and these two fuels are much faster to extract and more economical to use than coal, the Soviet Seven-Year Plan decided to accelerate the development of oil and gas production, especially the oil and gas industry in the area between the Volga River and the Ural Mountains. By 1965, the proportion of oil and gas in the Soviet fuel production will increase from 31% in 1958 to 51%, while the proportion of coal will decrease from 59% to 43%.
    The Soviet Union's oil production has long exceeded the total of Britain, France, West Germany, and the Netherlands, but it will more than double in the next seven years. By 1965, the Soviet Union's per capita oil production will reach more than one ton. The petroleum products produced in the seven years will not only fully meet the needs of the national economy, but also greatly improve the quality.
    Gas will develop even faster. In the next seven years, a new gas industrial center will be established in Uzbekistan, and the output will be expanded five times, and more than 26,000 kilometers of gas pipelines will be laid. Seven years later, the cities that already have gas supply will complete gasification, liquefied gas will be supplied to cities far from the gas pipelines, and more importantly, a large amount of industrial gas will be supplied. In the seven years, 80% of the gas production will be used for industry under the conditions of meeting the needs of chemical raw materials and people's lives. These measures will not only have great economic benefits, but also improve the air in cities. (With picture)

### 电力翻一番石油煤气大增产

专栏：向共产主义迈进的纲领  苏联的七年计划①

    电力翻一番石油煤气大增产
    以高速度发展经济，在同美国进行的和平竞赛中赢得时间，便是苏联最近公布的发展国民经济七年计划的主旨。从这一点出发，计划规定从1959到1965年的七年中，工业总产值将增加80％，其中生产资料的生产增加85％—88％。
    电力
    今后七年（1959—1965年），苏联发电站建设的规模空前巨大，全国电力站的总发电能力将翻一番以上，从现在的五千万瓩增加到一亿一千万瓩左右。这就是说，在这七年中，苏联将要建成和投入生产的新发电站的总发电能力，将超过苏联过去四十年建成和投入生产的全部发电站发电能力的总和。
    空前大规模地进行发电站建设，将使得1965年苏联的电力产量从今年的两千三百三十亿度增加到五千亿到五千二百亿度。到那时候，目前已经几乎全部电气化了的苏联工业生产的电气化程度将进一步提高，电气化铁路线将比现在增加大约两万公里，全国所有国营农场、农业技术修理站、集体农庄和工人住宅区，都将全部电气化。这样，苏联就将在实现列宁关于苏联全盘电气化的理想方面迈出决定性的一步。
    在七年计划期间，苏联发展电力工业的主要方向是：优先建设火力发电站，以进一步加快电力工业和国家电气化发展的速度。
    最近七年间，苏联的火力透平发电站的总发电能力将增加一点三倍到一点四倍。在全国投入生产的新透平发电站的五千八百万到六千万瓩的总发电能力中，火力发电站将占五分之四左右。在火力发电站中，又将着重建设安装有发电能力为十万瓩到三十万瓩的汽轮发电机组的电力站。现在，苏联已经在设计二百三十个这样的火力发电站。其中，有三十个发电站的发电能力将超过一百万瓩。到1965年，苏联就将建成二十多个发电能力为一百万到二百万瓩的火力发电站。
    苏联在今后几年内还将建设发电能力为二百四十万瓩的巨型火力发电站。这将是世界上最大的火力发电站，它将安装发电能力为六十万瓩的汽轮机。据悉，美国也打算在最近几年内制造巨型的汽轮机，但其发电能力最大的只有四十五万瓩。
    水电站建设也要进行。现在正在建设的斯大林格勒、克列门楚格、沃特金斯克和布赫塔马水电站，以及世界上最大的布拉次克水电站，都将在最近几年建成和投入生产。此外，还将着重在国内一些缺乏廉价燃料的地区开始建设一些新的水力发电站。同时，还要建成一些原子能发电站。　（据新华社）
    石油和煤气
    在国民经济需要的燃料方面，今后七年有相当重要的改变。由于苏联拥有非常丰富的石油和煤气资源，而这两种燃料开采起来比煤快得多，用起来也比煤节省，因此苏联七年计划决定加快发展石油和煤气的生产，特别是伏尔加河和乌拉尔之间的地区的石油和煤气工业。到1965年，石油和煤气在苏联燃料生产中所占的比重，将由1958年的31％增长到51％，而煤所占的比重将由59％下降到43％。
    苏联的石油产量早已超过英、法、西德和荷兰的总和，但在未来的七年间它还要翻一番以上。到1965年，苏联按人口平均的石油产量就要达到一吨以上。七年间生产出的石油制品不但能充分满足国民经济的需要，而且质量也要大大提高。
    煤气更要飞速发展，七年之间要在乌兹别克斯坦建立新的煤气工业中心，要使产量扩大到五倍，并将铺设二万六千多公里长的煤气管。七年后，现在已有煤气供应的城市，将完成煤气化，对距煤气管较远的城市要供应液化煤气，更重要的是要大量供应工业用煤气。七年间，在满足化学原料和人民生活方面的需要的条件下，煤气产量的80％将用于工业。这些措施不但可以收到很大的经济效果，而且还能改善城市的空气。（附图片）
