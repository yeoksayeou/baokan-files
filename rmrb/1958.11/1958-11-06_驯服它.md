    Taming It
    By Our Correspondent Zhao Yuxin

      "Bellows blown by a donkey,
      Eight-foot lathe turned by hand;
      Twenty-one blacksmiths,
      Heating furnaces before the ancient temple gate."
    This poem is a depiction of the existing foundation of the machine industry in the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province, as of July this year, when the people of the special district began to build machine tools on a large scale. On this weak foundation, the eight million people of the entire district, under the leadership of the Party, worked hard and followed the principle of "small, indigenous, and mass-based." In just over two months, they manufactured 4,163 various lathes, planers, milling machines, drilling machines, etc., increasing the district's mechanical equipment tenfold, arming 165 newly built and expanded factories, and laying a material foundation for the future development of the machine industry and agricultural mechanization. Under conditions of lacking equipment, technology, and raw materials, these machine tools were able to emerge in large quantities in a short period of time, which shows the great enthusiasm and high aspirations of the people throughout the district. Now I will write down a few stories as a brief introduction to the local experts and advanced figures.
          Two Big Hammers Build a Lathe
    Who would believe that a bright and delicate lathe could be built with two big hammers? Wang Fuyong, a 73-year-old man from Hebei Province, did just that.
    Wang Fuyong is a member of the Xujiazhuang People's Commune in Suning County. He has loved machines since he was young and repaired guns for the militia during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Before manufacturing this lathe, he was responsible for repairing farm tools in the commune. In July this year, at a commune meeting discussing how to achieve agricultural mechanization, everyone agreed that if they could build a lathe themselves, mechanization would be achieved faster. Old man Wang Fuyong resolutely undertook this task. He said: "In order to build socialism, we will carve out machines even if we have to do it by hand." But a lathe is not a hoe, and it is not easy for farmers with bare hands after all. For example, the bed surface needs to be flat, but the two steel rails serving as the bed body were high in the middle and low on both sides. So they tied up a large sandstone weighing more than 300 pounds, and four people carried it to grind on the rail surface. After four days, the stone was ground down by more than 20 pounds, only removing a layer of rust from the rail surface. The old man knew that brute force would not work, so he found a piece of high-speed steel from his home, made it into a planing tool, and planed it little by little, finally leveling the rail surface. Many holes needed to be drilled in the machine, so the old man Wang Fuyong again used high-speed steel to make a crankshaft drill, leading several young people to drill in shifts. The hands of the three girls were covered with blisters, which they wrapped with cloth and continued to drill. With the perseverance of "grinding an iron pestle into a needle," they spent more than a month creating 33 kinds of special tools and making more than 400 parts for the entire lathe. The lathe was born. After people observed and tested it, they all agreed that the lathe had good running performance and its precision met the requirements of a general belt lathe.
    Now the Xujiazhuang Farm Tool Repair Factory has used it to make many agricultural machines.
            Master-Apprentice Competition
    "Look in the morning, touch in the afternoon, learn to operate in two days, produce finished products in three days." This is the slogan of the new apprentices at the Anci County Agricultural Machinery Factory for learning skills quickly. Eighteen-year-old female apprentice Liu Wanying was even bolder, starting a production competition with her master less than two months after joining the factory.
    Liu Wanying is a recent graduate of elementary school this year. She joined the factory in early July and learned to operate independently after three days, sharing a planer with her master, Liu Jingzhi, in day and night shifts. One day, the master and apprentice participated in a factory-wide staff meeting. Liu Wanying suddenly said to Liu Jingzhi: "Master Liu, in order to complete the task of producing 100 lathes before National Day, I want to challenge you." An apprentice challenging a master! This surprised Master Liu, who had just switched from bicycle repairman to lathe operator half a year ago. A new female apprentice daring to declare war on her master is no simple thing!
    That night was Liu Wanying's night shift, and Master Liu helped her sharpen the knife, fix the workpiece, and prepare all the tools before going back to rest. In the past, Liu Wanying only planed two large tool rests per shift, while Master Liu planed four. She thought that she would have to plane at least four tonight. She concentrated all her energy on the planer, not willing to miss a second. Just as dawn broke, Master Liu came to work. By this time, Liu Wanying had already planed six, and the seventh was just fixed. Master Liu happily said: "Well done, you really surpassed me," but Liu Wanying did not leave for a long time after getting off work, standing aside to assist her master. Master Liu thought, "Our competition is to achieve communism as soon as possible, not to gamble on winning or losing. The harder you push, the faster I should run." So he accelerated the speed and improved the method of cutting, planing seven in one shift, and taught this secret to his apprentice after work. He also wrote a big-character poster to encourage her, saying: "Study hard, practice hard, delve hard, master and apprentice work together to move forward, learn from each other and compete, why does it take three years to learn a skill?"
            The First Gantry Planer
    In July this year, the Jinghai County Iron Factory decided to trial-produce a gantry planer. When a large number of lathes were being produced, an interesting debate arose among the workers. "This is wishful thinking. With our broken-down operation, can we make a gantry planer?" Li Ruifeng, a sixth-grade lathe operator, repeatedly said: "Without a gantry planer, you can't make a gantry planer." Zhou Jiqing, a fitter, strongly disagreed with this statement, saying: "As long as you are determined, you can make it." Li Ruifeng said: "No, making a gantry planer is not the same as making a hand-cranked waterwheel. I have been working on gantry planers since I was sixteen years old. Aren't I clearer than you?" Indeed, in this small iron factory with only one or two years of history, not many people had seen a gantry planer, so many people believed Li Ruifeng's words, and the debate between the two opinions remained deadlocked. At this time, Li Shusheng, a lathe operator who usually didn't like to talk, suddenly spoke up: "Then how was the world's first gantry planer made?" "That's right!" Everyone quickly understood.
    The work of manufacturing the gantry planer began. From making the model, sand casting, and casting to processing the raceways and body, they encountered countless difficulties. Zhou Jiqing and Li Shusheng had both cried with anxiety, but encouraged by the Party branch, they adopted the method of "hand-carving" and "gnawing with teeth" using backward tools, and worked hard for ten days and nights to assemble the first gantry planer. But as soon as the test run started, everyone's smiles disappeared, because it could only go forward and not backward. Zhou Jiqing and others circled it all night, but could not find the reason. The next day, they ran to the Yangliuqing factory to ask for advice, and learned that the pulley was installed backward. After correcting it, the gantry planer finally turned freely. Although this product is not very "regular," it has become the "mother hen" of the factory. Currently, the workers have used this "mother hen" to produce more than 100 lathes and two new gantry planers. (Attached picture)

    驯服它
    本报记者　赵玉昕
      “鼓风机器毛驴拉，
      八尺车床用手摇；
      二十一个黑铁匠，
      古庙门前烘炉烧。”
    这首诗，是河北省天津专区人民在今年7月开始大造机床时，对本专区机器工业现有基础的一个写照。在这种薄弱的基础上，全专区的八百万人民发奋图强，在党的领导下，本着“小土群”的方针，只两个多月的时间，就制造出各种车床、刨床、铣床、钻床等四千一百六十三台，使全区的机械设备翻了十番，武装起新建和扩建的一百六十五个工厂，给今后的机械工业的发展和农业机械化奠定了物质基础。在设备、技术、原材料样样缺少的条件下，这些机床能够在短期间大量地问世，可见全区人民的干劲之大、志气之高。现在我把几个故事写在下面，作为对土专家、先进人物的点滴介绍。
          两把大锤造旋床
    谁能相信一台明亮精致的旋床是用两把大锤造起来的。河北省有个七十三岁的老汉王福永就干过这样的事。
    王福永是肃宁县徐家庄人民公社的社员，从年青时候就爱好机器，抗战时期曾为民兵修造过枪枝；在制造这台车床以前，在社里担任农具修配工作。今年7月，在一次讨论如何实现农业机械化的社务会议上，大家都认为如果自力更生地制造出一台车床来，实现机械化就会更快了，老汉王福永毅然承担了这一任务。他说：“为了建设社会主义，用手刻也要刻出机器来。”但车床不是锄头，对赤手空拳的庄稼汉来说，毕竟是不容易的。比如床面要求是平的，而作为床身的两条钢轨，当中高两边低。于是他们绑起了一块三百多斤重的大砂石，四个人抬着在轨面上磨，四天以后，石头磨掉了二十多斤，只把轨面磨去了一层铁锈。老汉知道硬干不行，就从家里找出一块锋钢，打成了抢刀，一点点地抢，终于把轨面抢平了。机床上需要钻很多眼，老汉王福永又用锋钢打成了曲轴钻，率领着几个青年轮班钻，三个姑娘的手磨满了泡，用布缠上继续钻。他们用“铁杵磨锈针”的毅力，花了一个多月功夫，创造了三十三种特制的工具，制成了整个车床的四百多个部件，车床诞生了。经过人们观测、试验，都认为这台车床的运转性能良好，精密度达到了一般皮带车床的要求。
    现在徐家庄农具修配厂已经用它做出了许多农业机械了。
            师徒竞赛
    “上午看，下午摸，两天能操作，三天出成活”。这是安次县农业机械厂新徒工们快速学艺的口号。十八岁的女徒工刘万英更为大胆，她进厂不满两月，竟然和师傅开展了生产竞赛。
    刘万英是今年才毕业的高小生。7月初进厂，三天后就学会了独立操作，和师傅刘景芝分日夜两班共用一台牛头刨。一天，师徒俩参加了全厂职工大会。刘万英忽然向刘景芝说：“刘师傅，为了完成在国庆节前生产一百台车床的任务，我要向你挑战。”徒弟向师傅挑战！使这个半年前刚由自行车修理工转为车工的刘师傅不由得一怔。刚进厂的女徒弟，敢和师傅宣战，不简单！
    当天晚上，是刘万英的夜班，刘师傅帮助她磨好了刀，卡好了活，把一切工具准备齐全，才回去休息。刘万英过去一班只刨两个大刀架，刘师傅刨四个，她想，今天晚上再少也要刨四个才行。她把全副精力集中在刨床上，一秒钟也舍不得错过。天刚亮，刘师傅就来上班了。这时刘万英已刨完六个，第七个才卡上。刘师傅高兴地说：“好样的，果然超过我了”，但刘万英下班后很久也不走，站在一旁给师傅当下手。刘师傅想，“我们竞赛是为了早日实现共产主义，不是赌输赢，你赶得越紧，我就该跑的更快。”于是他加快转数，改进吃刀方法，一班刨了七个，下班后并把这个秘诀教会了徒弟。并且写成大字报勉励她说：“苦学苦练苦钻研，师徒携手齐向前，互相学习又竞赛，学艺何必用三年”。
            第一台龙门刨
    今年7月，静海县铁工厂决定试制龙门刨，大批生产车床的时候，在职工中引起了一场有趣的争论。“这是妄想，凭咱们这个烂摊子，制得成龙门刨？”六级车工李瑞峰反复地说：“没有龙门刨，是造不出龙门刨来的。”钳工周吉庆很不同意这个说法，他说：“只要决心大，就能制成。”李瑞峰说：“不行，造龙门刨不比造个手摇水车，我从十六岁上就在龙门刨上干活，难道不比你们清楚？”的确，在这个只有一两年历史的小铁工厂里，见过龙门刨的人并不多，所以不少人信了李瑞峰的话，两种意见的争论，就相持不下。这时，平常不爱说话的车工李树生忽然发言了：“那么，世界上的第一台龙门刨是怎么造出来的？”“对呀！”大家很快地开了窍。
    制造龙门刨的工作开始了，从制模型、翻砂、铸件到加工跑道和机身，不知碰到了多少困难。周吉庆、李树生都曾急哭过，但在党支部的鼓励下，他们用落后的工具采取了“手刻”、“牙啃”的办法，苦战了十昼夜，把第一台的龙门刨装成了。但一试车，大伙的笑容又消失了，因为它只能往前走不能往后退。周吉庆等围它转了一整夜，也找不出原因。第二天跑到杨柳青工厂去请教，才知道皮带轮装反了。纠正以后，这台龙门刨才自如地转动起来。这台产品虽然不十分“规矩”，但它成为这个工厂的“母鸡”，目前工人已用这台“母鸡”，生产了一百多台车床和两台新的龙门刨。（附图片）
