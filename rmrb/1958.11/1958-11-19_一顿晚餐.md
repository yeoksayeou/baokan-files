    A Dinner
    Li Zhenjia, Wujin Hutang Commune
    The Party Secretary notified Genbao to go to the Red Star Steel Plant to support the satellite launching.

    After getting off the bus, it was already past 11 o'clock at night, and Genbao hadn't had dinner yet. All the restaurants were closed and the lights were out, except for a faint light coming from the small canteen at the end of the street. Genbao, with a hopeful heart, ran inside. All the stoves in the canteen were turned off, and only an old man in a white coat was mopping the floor.
    "Comrade, is there anything to eat now?" Genbao asked, putting down his bedding roll.
    "Sorry, everything is sold out." The old man straightened his back slightly and continued his work. Disappointed, Genbao tightened his belt and asked for directions to the Red Star Steel Plant. When the old man heard it was the Red Star Steel Plant, he looked up and saw the "Steel Warrior" badge on Genbao's chest. He quickly pulled him to the door, pointed east, and said, "Go down the main road for three li, and you'll be there." Then, he squinted his narrow eyes and said loudly, as if sharing good news with a friend, "I heard that the Red Star Plant is going to launch a big satellite tonight. The County Party Secretary has even moved his bedding there!"
    "Really! I'm also going there to support the satellite launching," Genbao said with a smile, and strode eastward. He hadn't walked far when he heard the old man shouting from behind, "Comrade! Come back!" Genbao, thinking he had dropped something, hurried back to the canteen, only to see a meal already placed on the table! Before Genbao could speak, the old man said with a smile, "Comrade, please make do with this. This is the only meal left in the canteen." Genbao thought, "Didn't he say everything was sold out? How come there's one now?" Just as he was about to ask, he heard a young man inside talking to the old man: "Master Fang, you haven't had dinner yet. Why did you give your own meal to someone else?"

    一顿晚餐
    武进湖塘公社　李振家
    党委书记通知根宝去红星炼铁厂支援放卫星。
    下了汽车，已是深夜十一点多钟了，根宝还没顾上吃晚饭。几家饭馆，都已经关门熄灯了，只有街梢头那家小食堂的门还透出一丝灯光。根宝抱着碰碰运气的心情跑了进去，食堂里几只炉灶都停了火，只有一个穿着白褂子的大爷还在拖地板。
    “同志，现在还有什么吃的？”根宝放下被包问道。
    “对不起，都卖完了。”老头微微挺了挺腰，仍旧干他的活儿。根宝失望地束束裤带，顺便问了一声去红星炼铁厂的路。老头一听是红星炼铁厂，抬头看见了根宝胸前那块有“钢铁战士”字样的符号，忙拉着他到门口往东边一指说：“顺大路下去三里路就是。”接着，他眯起一双细长的眼睛，像向朋友报喜那样，大声地说：“听说今晚红星厂要放大卫星，县委书记都搬着铺盖住到那儿去啦！”
    “是哇！我也是去那儿支援放卫星的。”根宝含笑地说完，迈开大步往东走了。没走几步，只听得老头在后面喊：“同志！回来。”根宝不知道掉了什么东西，忙又回到食堂里，只见一份饭菜已经放在桌上啦！老头没等根宝开口，就笑迷迷地说：“同志，委屈一下，食堂里就剩下这么一份饭菜了。”根宝心想：“刚才他不是说都卖完了？怎么现在又有了呢？”正想发问，忽听见里面有一个青年人正在和那老头说话：“方师傅，你还没吃晚饭呢，怎么把自己的饭菜端给别人了？”
