Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 24th: Neijiang Prefecture, a major cotton and oil-bearing crop production area in Sichuan Province, pays special attention to quality in the purchase of agricultural products. All of the 250,000 dan of cotton and over 40 million jin of peanuts that have already been stored meet the standards.

This year, Neijiang Prefecture has universally implemented the "Four On-the-Spot" method in agricultural product procurement: on-the-spot inspection and grading, on-the-spot payment, on-the-spot weighing, and on-the-spot storage, which has greatly accelerated the procurement progress. However, in the beginning, some areas relaxed inspection, processing, and storage work, resulting in poor quality of the purchased products. Various localities immediately took measures to reverse this situation. The approach was to first educate cadres on the importance of quality and to emphasize patriotic education for farmers, encouraging them to sell high-quality agricultural products to the state. In addition, the principle of "premium price for premium quality" and pricing according to grade was implemented in specific work. Inspection work was strengthened. For example, after implementing the inspection method of "inspecting according to samples, hand-tearing and ruler measurement, and democratic appraisal" for cotton, the qualification rate reached over 98%. At the same time, the utilization rate of processing tools was improved. Cotton was always dried when there was too much water and always shaken when there were too many impurities. Peanuts were washed clean and dried before being put into storage to minimize impurities. In warehouse work, graded storage, graded packaging, graded stacking, and graded transportation were implemented, and the principle of "first in, first out" was followed, with frequent turning and sunning to avoid moisture and mildew.

    重视农产品采购质量
    内江专区入库的棉花和花生全部合格
    据新华社成都24日电　四川省棉花和油料的主要产区——内江专区在农产品收购中特别注意质量，已经入库的二十五万担棉花、四千多万斤花生全部合格。
    内江专区今年在农产品采购中，普遍推行了就社验级、付款、过秤、保管的“四就”办法，收购进度很快。但是在开始时，有的地方一度放松检验、加工、保管等工作，收购的产品质量较差。各地立即采取措施扭转这一情况。办法是首先教育干部认识质量的重要，对农民强调爱国主义教育，把上等的农产品售给国家。另外，在具体工作中，贯彻了优质优价、按等论价的方针。加强了检验工作，如棉花实行“对样评收，手扯尺量，民主鉴定”的检验方法后，合格率达到98％以上。同时提高加工工具的使用率，做到棉花水多必晒、杂多必抖，花生洗净，烘干才入库，尽量减少杂质。在仓库工作中，实行分级入库、分级打包、分级堆放、分级运出，并且作到先进先出，多翻晒，避免受潮、霉烂。
