Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 11th: The Southern Agricultural Collaboration Conference of seven provinces and regions, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, was held in Guangzhou from October 27th to November 4th. The conference discussed the main issues in current rural work after the rural communes were established, and also discussed the issue of a greater leap forward in agricultural production in the seven provinces and regions next year.

The conference focused on discussing two issues: the distribution of rural people's communes in 1958 and the operation of collective welfare undertakings. Regarding distribution, the conference believed that unified distribution by the commune is generally better. This year's bumper harvest should allow the people's communes to accumulate more, and at the same time, the income of the commune members should be increased more to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses. After the bumper harvest, the supply system of eating without money in the commune is a general trend and can be widely adopted. Other aspects such as clothing, medical care, weddings and funerals, and schooling can also be gradually covered by the commune as its resources allow. However, the wage portion of remuneration according to labor still has a positive effect and the proportion should not be too small. It is appropriate to calculate supplies and wages based on labor, with each accounting for half, so that commune members have a certain amount of cash income at their disposal in addition to being guaranteed in the main aspects of life. In order to ensure the commune develops wages, the conference pointed out that the current situation of the people's communes having more income in grain and less in cash needs to be changed urgently. In the future, in addition to continuing to increase grain production, the commune's production should also plant more cash crops and develop diversified operations to further increase income. At present, it is necessary to focus on the winter sideline production of the people's communes.

Regarding collective welfare undertakings, the conference believed that the current focus is on running three major things well: public canteens, childcare organizations, and homes of happiness. At the same time, it should also be combined with running medical and health care, schools, cultural entertainment, and other service undertakings. The conference pointed out that canteens must work hard to improve the production of non-staple foods in order to improve meals; nurseries and kindergartens must ensure good care, good education, and good growth; and homes of happiness should appropriately meet the needs of the elderly in their lives. To run collective welfare undertakings well, in addition to the party committee having a secretary to lead them, relevant government departments and relevant mass organizations must manage, supervise and inspect regularly, and summarize and promote experience in this area.

In terms of agricultural production, the seven provinces and regions have all achieved bumper harvests this year, with total grain output more than doubling compared to last year, approaching the total national output of last year. Among them, Guangxi increased production by more than double compared to last year, and Guangdong was close to double. The seven provinces and regions have all exceeded the target of an average yield of 800 jin per mu. The average per capita grain is about 1,500 jin. The total cotton output of the seven provinces and regions has also more than doubled compared to last year, with Hubei's average yield of ginned cotton exceeding 100 jin per mu and Sichuan's exceeding 60 jin. The seven provinces and regions are the main sugarcane producing areas in China, and the total sugarcane output this year has increased by more than double compared to last year. Other oil crops and cash crops have also increased in production. The conference pointed out that the great harvest in the seven provinces and regions was achieved under the guidance of the idea of continuous revolution. This year, the thinking of leaders and the masses has been gradually liberated, the production increase targets and measures have been gradually increased, and the drive has been higher than the last. The seven provinces and regions have implemented the eight-point "charter" of water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, close planting, pest control (disease and pest control), tools (tool improvement), and management (field management) relatively well, and the points that have played a greater role in increasing production this year are water, fertilizer, close planting, and field management, and the other points have also gained some experience. However, all eight points still need to be further and more specifically and systematically implemented.

Regarding next year's production, the seven provinces and regions will further increase the yield per unit area next year, and decided to engage in 10% of the large-area high-yield satellite fields in order to change the farming system in South China, which is actually extensive cultivation and low yield, and create conditions for gradually reducing the sown area and implementing a new farming system of less planting, high yield, and more harvest. The seven provinces and regions are planning to reduce the planting area of sweet potatoes next year, increase the proportion of oil and grain, and plant more cotton, oil crops, and various cash crops, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in cotton and oil crops and increase the income of the communes within one or two years. The conference emphasized that the southern provinces should vigorously develop diversified operations, especially forestry and freshwater aquaculture, and should strive for rapid and high yields, and on the basis of the great development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery production, develop the processing industry and chemical industry of agricultural, forestry, aquatic and livestock products, and greatly increase the income of the communes many times over.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin pointed out in his concluding remarks at the meeting: The distribution of the people's communes must be grasped in the past two or three months, otherwise it will affect next year's production. Running collective welfare undertakings well is related to the consolidation of the commune system. The party committee secretary must grasp production with one hand and livelihood with the other, and must not relax. The organization of the commune should be further implemented through militarization, action through combat, and life through collectivization. "Three-ization" should be combined with a democratic style. The management of the commune's production, life, economy, finance, and labor should all be democratized to prevent cadres from developing a style of coercion and command. He also asked all localities to pass the test of communist education and to seriously study the production organization and management of the communes this winter.

Regarding agricultural production, Comrade Tan Zhenlin pointed out that it is necessary to gradually change the situation of 500 million farmers engaging in food production. The solution is to create conditions and gradually implement the basic farmland system of less planting, high yield, and more harvest, so that a large amount of labor can be extracted from agriculture to develop industry and diversified operations, and a large amount of social products can be increased, so that the differences between urban and rural areas, workers and peasants, and manual and mental labor can be gradually eliminated, and the transition to communism can be made. He also pointed out that the implementation of the basic farmland system can accelerate the speed of agricultural mechanization and electrification, because equipment can be concentrated on basic farmland. On basic farmland, the eight-point "charter" such as water, fertilizer, soil, seed density, etc. are also easier to implement more systematically. The irrigation of basic farmland should be automated or mechanized, and rational fertilization, deep plowing, close planting, and garden-style management should be achieved. He asked all localities to start pilot work on basic farmland next year. Regarding tool reform, he asked all localities to achieve semi-mechanization within a time limit, widely promote the use of hydropower, wind power, and biogas, widely promote the accumulation of coarse fertilizer in the fields and the large-scale production of native chemical fertilizers, and widely promote cart-ization and wooden rail-ization to save labor in many ways and ensure the all-round leap forward in commune production. Finally, Comrade Tan Zhenlin emphasized that all localities must organize the diversified sideline production of the people's communes this winter and next spring.

    南方农业协作会议讨论当前农村工作主要问题
    一手抓生产　一手抓生活
    谭震林同志指出：当前人民公社的分配必须在最近两三个月内抓好。“三化”要与民主作风相结合，公社的管理应贯彻民主化。必须逐步改变五亿农民搞吃饭的局面，逐步实行少种、高产、多收的基本农田制，从农业方面抽出大量劳动力来发展工业和多种经营。
    新华社广州11日电　广东、广西、湖北、湖南、云南、贵州、四川等七省区农业协作会议，于10月27日到11月4日在广州举行。会议讨论了农村公社化后当前农村工作中的主要问题，也讨论了明年七省区农业生产更大跃进的问题。
    这次会议着重讨论了农村人民公社1958年的分配和办好集体福利事业两个问题。关于分配，会议认为一般以公社统一分配为好。今年农业大丰收，应该使人民公社多积累一些，同时也应该使社员收入多增加一些，以鼓舞群众的积极性。丰收后公社实行吃饭不要钱的供给制是大势所趋，可以普遍采用。其他穿衣、医药、婚丧、上学等也可量力逐步由公社包下来。但是，目前按劳取酬的工资部分仍有积极作用，所占比例不宜过小。以劳动力计算供给和工资以各占一半为宜；使社员除生活主要方面获得保证外，还有一定的现金收入供自己支配。为保证公社开发工资，会议指出：今年人民公社收入粮食多、现金少的情况急需改变。今后公社的生产除继续增产粮食外，应多种经济作物，发展多种经营来进一步增加收入。当前就须大抓人民公社的冬季副业生产。
    关于集体福利事业，会议认为：当前的重点是办好公共食堂、托儿组织和幸福院三件大事，同时结合着办好医药卫生、学校、文化娱乐和其他服务事业。会议指出：食堂须努力搞好副食品的生产，来办好伙食；托儿所和幼儿园要作到养得好、教得好和长得好；幸福院应适当满足老人生活上的需要。要办好集体福利事业，除党委有书记专门领导外，有关政府部门和有关群众团体必须管理，经常督促检查和总结、推广这个方面的经验。
    农业生产方面，七省区今年都获得了大丰收，粮食总产量比去年翻了一番以上，接近去年全国的总产量。其中广西比去年增产一倍多，广东接近两倍。七省区分别都超过了平均亩产八百斤的指标。按人口平均每人有粮一千五百斤左右。棉花七省区总产量比去年也翻了一番多，湖北皮棉平均亩产百斤以上，四川六十斤以上。七省区是我国甘蔗主产区，今年甘蔗总产量比去年增产一倍多。其他油料和经济作物都增了产。会议指出：七省区的大丰收，是在不断革命的思想指导下取得的。今年领导和群众的思想是逐步解放的，增产指标和措施是逐步加码的，干劲也是一浪比一浪高。七省区在执行水、肥、土、种、密、害（除治病虫害）、工（改良工具）、管（田间管理）等八条“宪法”方面贯彻较好，对今年增产作用较大的是水、肥、密植和田间管理几条，其他几条也取得了一定经验。但是八条都还有待于进一步更具体更系统地贯彻。
    明年生产问题，七省区明年要进一步提高单位面积产量，并决定搞10％的大面积高产卫星田，以便改变华南地区实际上是广种薄收的耕作制度，为逐步收缩播种面积，实行少种、高产、多收的新的耕作制度创造条件。七省区明年都准备减少甘薯的种植面积，增加油、粮的比重，并多种棉花、油料和各种经济作物，争取一二年内作到棉花、油料自给和增加公社的收入。会议强调南方各省应大力发展多种经营，特别是林业、淡水养殖都应争取快速、高产，并在农林牧渔生产大发展的基础上发展对农产、林产、水产、畜产的加工工业和化学工业，成倍地大量增加公社的收入。
    谭震林同志在会议总结时指出：当前人民公社的分配必须在最近两三月内抓好，否则将影响明年的生产。办好集体福利事业关系到公社制度的巩固，党委书记必须一手抓生产一手抓生活，不能放松。公社的组织军事化、行动战斗化和生活集体化应进一步贯彻，“三化”应与民主作风相结合，公社的生产、生活、经济、财务和劳动的管理都应贯彻民主化，以防止干部发展强迫命令作风。他还要求各地一定要过好共产主义教育这一关和在今冬认真研究一下公社的生产组织和经营管理的问题。
    关于农业生产，谭震林同志指出：必须逐步改变五亿农民搞吃饭的局面，解决办法就是创造条件，逐步实行少种、高产、多收的基本农田制，这样才能从农业方面抽出大量劳动力来发展工业和多种经营，才能大量增加社会产品，才能逐步消灭城乡、工农和体力劳动脑力劳动之间的差别，向共产主义过渡。他还指出：实行了基本农田制，就可加快农业机械化、电气化的速度，因为设备可集中于基本农田。在基本农田上，水肥土种密等八条“宪法”也更易于更系统地贯彻。基本农田的灌溉应作到自流化或机械化，作到合理施肥、深耕密植和管理园田化等等。他要求各地明年就开始基本农田的试点工作。关于工具改革，他要求各地限期实现半机械化，广泛推广对水力、风力和沼气的利用，广泛推广田头积粗肥和大量制造土化肥，广泛推广车子化木轨化，从多方面节省劳力，保证公社生产全面跃进。最后，谭震林同志强调要求各地今冬明春必须组织好人民公社的多种副业生产。
