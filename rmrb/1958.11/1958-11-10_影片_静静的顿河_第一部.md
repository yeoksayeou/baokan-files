    The film "And Quiet Flows the Don" Part One
    Sun Wei
    One of the most important works of Soviet literature, Mikhail Sholokhov's famous novel "And Quiet Flows the Don," has been adapted and directed by Sergei Gerasimov into a three-part color film series. During the recent Soviet Film Week in our country, we were able to see the first part of this series.
      "And Quiet Flows the Don" depicts the life and changes of the Cossacks before and after the October Revolution. In the early 16th century, many serfs in Russia, in order to escape the oppression and exploitation of aristocratic landlords and to gain freedom, fled to the Don region one after another. These were the later Cossacks. Here they established their own towns and villages and formed their own armed forces. However, the Cossacks soon became divided into two classes with different property statuses. The upper echelons and wealthy strata were bought off by the Tsarist government, became tools of the autocratic regime, and became nobles and landlords. The vast majority of poor Cossacks, the original Don farmers, as well as Russians and Ukrainians who later fled to the Don region, formed an exploited lower class. This class relationship became very apparent before the October Revolution. However, due to the Tsarist government's policies and the Cossacks' own ignorance, the hierarchical system, the patriarchal system, xenophobia, conservative traditions, and barbaric customs remained characteristics of Cossack life and detached it from the overall class struggle in Russia. "And Quiet Flows the Don" brilliantly analyzes the class relations and antagonism among the Cossacks and depicts the impact of the revolution on the Cossacks.
    The first part of the film "And Quiet Flows the Don" is exactly the same as the first part of the original work, narrating the life from the summer of 1913 to the winter of 1914. Although this short period includes both peaceful life and war, it is still far from the large-scale class struggle. We see the Cossacks' enlistment, farming, and weddings; we also see the impact of World War I on the fate and emotions of some Cossacks. However, the most significant thing is the class difference among the Cossacks and its role. Among the general Cossacks, there is a big difference between the poor peasants Koshevoi, Khristonya, and others and the rich peasants and merchants. There is also a considerable difference between the general well-to-do Cossacks and the Cossack aristocracy. The Listnitsky family can be said to be a representative of the latter. In general, this period is the eve of the revolutionary storm that hit Cossack society.
    The main character of "And Quiet Flows the Don," Grigory, belongs to the Cossack petty bourgeoisie, and he shows the characteristics of a middle peasant. This class often wanders at a crossroads but cannot find a way out. Lenin said that the past of this class makes it tend towards the bourgeoisie, its future makes it tend towards the proletariat, reason makes it tend towards the proletariat, and prejudice makes it tend towards the bourgeoisie. This is what determines Grigory's long and wavering path, sometimes on the side of the people and sometimes on the side of the counter-revolution. We see in the first part of the film "And Quiet Flows the Don" that Grigory is also in a contradictory mood. Resistance to the patriarchal system makes him willing to break with his father, the desire for land can make him submit to forced marriage, and the imperialist war and the enlightenment of the worker Jaranca make Grigory have a little new understanding of reality, prompting him to think about what the war means to the general Cossacks; What is the real value of "hero," "glory," and "loyalty," things that are inseparable from Cossack tradition. In the hospital, he treats the representatives of the royal family with contempt, venting his resentment towards the war. However, this protest does not yet have a rational understanding as its basis, and the traditional prejudices of the Cossacks are still deeply hidden in his soul. In the second and third parts of the film, we will see the development of Grigory's own contradictions.
    The fate of the Cossack women is tragic. Whether it is the passionate and strong Aksinya or the obedient and tolerant Natalya, their lives are unhappy, and they cannot get the love and life they desire. They are all victims of forced marriage. In the feudal patriarchal Cossack society, their efforts are not rewarded with an independent status but remain a bleak ending.
    The director used several concise scenes to movingly portray the image of the Communist Shtokman: interfering with the fight in front of the mill, Shtokman's interactions with Koshevoi and Khristonya, and Shtokman's arrest. The appearance of Shtokman in the Cossack residential area is like a spark in the dark night, indicating that the revolutionary force has penetrated Cossack society and wants to unite the oppressed classes among the Cossacks around it, to eliminate the prejudices and hatred cultivated in them by the ruling class, and to become one of the main forces of the revolution in the Don region. Shtokman is a Communist with experience in struggle, able to get close to the people, and is intelligent and firm. His life with his wife contrasts with the conservative and backward Cossack society. His short stay and arrest in the Cossack village made the surrounding poor Cossacks initially understand the truth of the revolution. Shtokman is one of the first successful images of revolutionaries created by Soviet writers.
    The appearance of the film "And Quiet Flows the Don" is of great significance. It not only makes the original work easier to popularize, but also expresses the original work with the unique artistic techniques of film, so that the ideological content of the original work obtains another rich and brilliant artistic form. In spirit and plot, this film is faithful to the original. Therefore, it will be like the illustrations drawn by the best painters for the best literary works, becoming an inseparable but independent work of art from the original.

    影片“静静的顿河”第一部
    孙玮
    苏联文学的最重要的作品之一、萧洛霍夫的著名长篇小说“静静的顿河”，经过格拉西莫夫的改编与导演，将拍成三部连续性的彩色影片，在最近我国举行的苏联电影周中，我们可以看到这组影片的第一部。
      “静静的顿河”的内容，是描写哥萨克在十月革命前后的生活状况和变化。十六世纪初，俄罗斯的许多农奴为了摆脱贵族地主的压迫与剥削，为了得到自由，相继逃到顿河地区，这就是后来的哥萨克。在这里他们建立了自己的许多村镇，组成了自己的武装队伍。但是哥萨克很快就分化成为财产地位不同的两种阶层。上层分子和富裕的阶层受了沙皇政府的笼络，变成了专制政体的工具，成了贵族和地主，广大的贫穷的哥萨克、原来的顿河农民、以及后来逃到顿河地区的俄罗斯人和乌克兰人，形成了一种被剥削的下层。这种阶级关系在十月革命前达到很显明的程度。但由于沙皇政府的策略和哥萨克本身的愚昧，等级制度、家长制度、排外思想、保守的传统与野蛮的习俗，仍然是哥萨克生活的特点，而且使它脱离了俄国的总的阶级斗争。“静静的顿河”非常出色地分析了哥萨克之间的阶级关系的对立，描写了革命在哥萨克中间的影响。
    影片“静静的顿河”的第一部恰好相同于原作的第一部，叙述从1913年夏天到1914年冬天这段时间的生活。这段不长的时期虽然既包括了和平生活，也包括了战争，但是距离大规模的阶级斗争还很远。我们看到了哥萨克的入营、农事、婚礼；也看到了第一次世界大战影响了一部分哥萨克的命运和情绪。然而最显著的还是哥萨克之间的阶级差别和它的作用。在一般的哥萨克中，贫农柯晒沃依、贺里斯托尼亚等人同富农和商人之间存在着很大的差别，在一般小康的哥萨克同哥萨克贵族之间也有相当的差别，李斯特尼茨基一家可以说是后者的代表。总的来说，这个时期是革命的暴风雨袭击哥萨克社会的前夕。
    “静静的顿河”的主要人物葛利高里，属于哥萨克中小资产阶级，他的身上表现了中农的特点。这个阶级常常在十字路口徘徊，然而却找不出出路。列宁说这个阶级的过去使它倾向资产阶级，它的未来使它倾向无产阶级，理智使它倾向无产阶级，偏见使它倾向资产阶级。也就是这一点决定了葛利高里一会儿在人民方面、一会儿在反革命方面的长期动摇的道路。我们在影片“静静的顿河”第一部里看到的葛利高里，也是处在矛盾的情绪中。对家长制的反抗使他不惜和父亲决裂，对土地的欲望可以使他顺从强制的婚姻，帝国主义的战争，工人贾兰沙的启发，使葛利高里对现实有了一点新的认识，推动他思考战争对一般的哥萨克究竟有什么意义；“英雄”、“光荣”、“忠勇”，这些与哥萨克传统分不开的东西真正有什么价值。在医院中他用轻蔑的态度对待皇室的代表，发泄对战争的愤恨，然而这种抗议还没有理性认识的基础，哥萨克的传统偏见还深深潜伏在他的灵魂里。将来，在影片的第二、三部中，我们会看到葛利高里本身的矛盾的发展。
    哥萨克妇女的命运是悲惨的，热情坚强的阿克西尼亚也好，顺从和能忍的娜塔莉亚也好，她们的生活都是不幸的，她们都不能得到她们渴望的爱情与生活，都是强制婚姻的牺牲。在封建家长制的哥萨克社会中，她们的努力换来的不是独立的地位，而仍然是凄凉的结局。
    导演用了几个简洁的场面，很动人地表现了共产党员施托克曼的形象：干涉磨房前面的打架、施托克曼和柯晒沃依、贺里斯托尼亚的来往和施托克曼的被捕。施托克曼在哥萨克居住区的出现，好像暗夜中的一颗火花，说明革命的力量已经渗入哥萨克社会，要把哥萨克中的被压迫阶层团结在它的周围，让他们身上被统治阶级培植起来的偏见与仇恨消灭，成为顿河地区革命的主力之一。施托克曼是一个有斗争的经验，能同人民接近，聪明而又坚定的共产党员。他和他的妻子的生活，对照着保守与落后的哥萨克社会。他在哥萨克村子的短短的停留和被捕，使周围的穷哥萨克初次认识了革命的真理。施托克曼是苏联作家最初塑造成功的革命者形象之一。
    影片“静静的顿河”的出现是有很大意义的。它不但使原作更容易普及，而且用电影所特有的艺术手法表现了原作，使原作的思想内容获得了另一种丰富绚烂的艺术形式。在精神与情节上，这部影片都是忠实于原作的。因此，它将像最好的画家给最好的文学作品绘制的插图一样，成为与原作不可分的，但又是独立的艺术作品。
