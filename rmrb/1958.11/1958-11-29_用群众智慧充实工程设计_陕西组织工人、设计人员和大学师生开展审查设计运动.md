    Using Mass Wisdom to Enrich Engineering Design
    Shaanxi Organizes Workers, Designers, and University Faculty and Students to Carry Out a Design Review Campaign

    (Our reporter Li Qian reports from Xi'an on the 28th) Shaanxi Province is currently carrying out a massive mass-based design review campaign. Participants in this campaign include workers from factories and construction enterprises, employees from various design units, as well as faculty and students from universities and colleges. They are using the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and integrating large, medium, and small approaches, to conduct reviews of engineering designs that are under construction or about to begin construction, through the method of vigorous airing of views, great debates, in order to carry out construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

    Design units in Shaanxi Province have achieved great successes during the Great Leap Forward, creating many design methods suitable for China's national conditions and producing some relatively reasonable designs. Various design units have completed their annual leap forward plans three to five months ahead of schedule, and construction costs have been reduced by more than two-thirds compared to the First Five-Year Plan period. However, the progress of the design units is still very uneven, and there are varying degrees of problems in the design work. For example, since the Great Leap Forward, the production quotas of many factories have been repeatedly broken by workers, and the output of some factories has even increased several times beyond their designed capacity, while some newly designed factories are still using pre-Great Leap Forward quotas; some industrial designs, when adopting equipment, still do not pay enough attention to substituting the small for the large, the light for the heavy, and the indigenous for the foreign; and many designs have not incorporated the new creations and inventions of the masses during the Great Leap Forward, and so on. In order to make the construction of the Second Five-Year Plan more suitable for China's conditions and truly achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided at the end of October to launch a mass-based design review campaign. It requires all units to review projects that started construction this year by the end of November, and projects that will start construction in the first quarter of next year by the end of December.

    The prominent feature of this design review is the extensive mobilization of the masses, using the method of vigorous airing of views and great debates to review the designs. In addition to the design departments mobilizing all employees to conduct a comprehensive review of all designs, expansion projects also mobilize the employees of the factory to review, and new construction projects mobilize the employees of similar production plants and design units, as well as faculty and students from universities and colleges, to conduct the review. The Shaanxi Provincial Machinery Bureau system, in addition to mobilizing the employees of the expansion factories to review the expansion projects, also organized the employees and faculty and students from units such as the Northwest Design Institute, the Eighth Design Branch of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Shaanxi Provincial Design Institute, Jiaotong University, Northwest Polytechnic University, and the Architectural Institute to review the designs of new factories such as the Heavy Machinery Factory and the Transformer Factory. Because this design review concentrated the wisdom of the masses, it put forward many valuable opinions for revising the designs. The Northwest Design Institute's design for a pottery pipe factory with an annual output of 900 tons had already paid attention to implementing the spirit of combining indigenous and foreign methods during the design process. For example, it selected six of the smallest domestically produced equipment, and the drying of the clay pipe blanks did not use heating, but used the method of drying on heated ground. Therefore, funds were saved. The Northwest Design Institute had even prepared to recommend this design as a typical example of combining indigenous and foreign methods to relevant departments. However, many problems were found in this design after it was reviewed by the masses. After the masses aired their views and debated, a new design plan was formulated. In addition to adopting advanced production quotas, this plan also extensively adopted indigenous equipment. For example, based on the principle of water mills, they changed the edge runner mill into a wooden one; the mud mixer and other equipment were also made of wood and a small amount of iron parts. Such equipment can be manufactured by various localities themselves, which can both save funds and speed up the construction of the factory. After such revisions, without reducing output and the degree of mechanization, the cost was reduced from more than 100,000 yuan to more than 60,000 yuan.

    In this mass-based design review campaign, all units have attached great importance to the review of process design. The results of the review of the process designs of forty-six medium-sized factories that have already started construction or are about to start construction by the three industrial bureaus and one design institute in Xi'an City saved more than 47 million yuan in investment, reduced 77 pieces of equipment, and also substituted the small for the large and the indigenous for the foreign for many pieces of equipment; due to the reduction of equipment, production plants and production workers, and welfare facilities were also reduced accordingly, so the construction area was also reduced by more than 38,000 square meters. The workshop of the switch rectifier factory has been basically completed. The factory leaders recently mobilized the masses to review and readjust the process, and with only a small increase in investment and indigenous equipment, the production capacity can be increased four times compared to the original design.

### 用群众智慧充实工程设计  陕西组织工人、设计人员和大学师生开展审查设计运动

    用群众智慧充实工程设计
    陕西组织工人、设计人员和大学师生开展审查设计运动
    本报西安28日电　记者李茜报道：陕西省正在开展一个声势浩大的群众性审查设计运动。参加这个运动的有工厂和建筑企业的工人，各设计单位的职工，以及大专院校的师生等。他们根据土洋结合和大中小并举的原则，用大鸣大放大辩论的方式，对正在建设和即将开始建设的工程设计进行审查，以便多快好省地进行建设。
    陕西省的设计单位在大跃进中取得了很大的成绩，创造出不少适合我国国情的设计方法，做出了一些比较合理的设计。各设计单位都提前三个月至五个月，完成了全年的跃进计划，建筑造价比第一个五年计划期间降低了三分之二以上。但是，各设计单位的进步还很不平衡，设计工作中也程度不同地存在着一些问题。例如，大跃进以来很多工厂的生产定额一再被工人突破，有的厂的产量甚至比设计能力提高了几倍，而新设计的一些厂却是用的跃进前的定额；有些工业设计采用设备时，对以小代大、以轻代重、以土代洋还很不注意；还有不少设计没有把群众在大跃进中的新创造发明吸收进去，等等。为了使第二个五年计划的建设更加适合我国的情况，真正做到多快好省，中共陕西省委在10月底就决定开展一个群众性的审查设计运动。要求各单位在11月底审查完今年开始施工的项目，12月底前审查完明年第一季度开始施工的项目。
    这次审查设计的突出特点是广泛发动群众，用大鸣大放大辩论的办法对设计进行审查。除设计部门发动全体职工对所有设计进行全面审查外，扩建项目还发动本厂职工审查，新建项目发动同类型生产厂和设计单位的职工以及高等学校师生进行审查。陕西省机械局系统除发动扩建厂的职工审查扩建项目外，还组织了西北设计院、第一机械工业部第八设计分院、陕西省设计院、交通大学、西北工业大学和建筑学院等单位的职工和师生，审查重型机械厂、变压器厂等新建厂的设计。这次审查设计由于集中了群众的智慧，提出了很多修改设计的宝贵意见。西北设计院设计的年产九百吨的陶土管厂，在设计时已经注意贯彻了土洋结合的精神。如选用了六台最小型的国产设备，陶土管坯的烘干没有采用暖气，而采用地炕烘干的办法。因此，节省了资金。西北设计院曾经准备把这个设计作为土洋结合的典型向有关部门推荐。但是，这项设计经群众审查又发现了很多问题。经过群众鸣放辩论，又制定了一个新的设计方案。这个方案除采用了先进的生产定额外，还大量采用了土设备。如他们根据水磨的原理，把轮碾机改成木制的；搅泥机和其他设备，也用木材和小部分铁件制造。这样的设备，各地都可以自己造，既能节约资金，又能加快建厂速度。经过这样修改以后，在不降低产量和机械化程度的情况下，造价由十多万元降至六万多元。
    在这次群众性的审查设计运动中，各单位都非常重视对工艺设计的审查。西安市三个工业局和一个设计院对已经开工和即将开工建设的四十六个中型工厂的工艺设计进行审查的结果，节约投资四千七百多万元，削减设备七十七台，另外还有很多设备以小代大，以土代洋；由于设备减少，生产厂房和生产工人、福利设施也相应减少，因此建筑面积也缩减了三万八千多平方公尺。开关整流器厂的厂房已经基本建成，工厂领导人员最近发动群众审查和重新调整了工艺，仅增加少量投资和土设备，就可比原设计提高生产能力四倍。
