    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 5th: Anshan Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 has broken through the old convention that only a few people can make steel, and is carrying out a mass steelmaking movement with organization and leadership, in which everyone participates. This movement shattered the mystique surrounding steelmaking in large enterprises, mobilized the enthusiasm of all open-hearth furnace workers, and demonstrated the infinite wisdom and power of the working masses in mastering modern steelmaking technology. With the broad masses mobilized, the production situation is getting better and better. In the ten days from October 17th to 26th, the plant's daily steel output increased by an average of more than 860 tons compared to the first ten days of October, and the smelting time for each furnace of steel was shortened by more than 40 minutes.

    The mass steelmaking movement in the No. 1 Steel Plant began with the No. 5 open-hearth furnace. In the past, only a very few steelmakers were responsible for steelmaking on Anshan's open-hearth furnaces. They controlled the entire smelting process, and the helpers and ordinary workers on the furnace could only do some steelmaking preparation work and miscellaneous work before and after the furnace under the command of the steelmakers. This regulation was broken by the workers this time. When the steelmaker of the No. 5 furnace emphasized objective difficulties and believed that the smelting time for a furnace of steel could not be broken through eight hours, his assistant, Cui Zhinian, with the support of the open-hearth furnace Party branch, stepped forward to try smelting a furnace, and as a result, he produced a furnace of steel in only six hours and fifty minutes. The plant's Party committee was greatly inspired by this example and deeply realized that the regulation that only steelmakers can make steel had affected the improvement of production levels. Therefore, it immediately seized on this advanced element and called on all open-hearth furnaces to learn from their experience. Subsequently, assistants and ordinary workers who understood steelmaking technology in various open-hearth furnaces actively participated in steelmaking, and a mass steelmaking movement quickly developed throughout the plant.

    This movement initially included three main aspects: (1) general workers with independent operational capabilities independently operated and directed steelmaking; (2) steelmakers acted as mentors, smelting a furnace of steel together with assistants or even ordinary workers; (3) concentrating the wisdom of all furnace workers to collectively smelt a furnace of steel. However, this movement is currently continuing to move forward. For example, in the past, furnace protection and thermal engineering were the responsibility of specialized technical personnel. Now, the plant's Party committee, on the basis of "steelmaking by all," has put forward a further action slogan of "furnace protection by all, mastery of thermal engineering technology by all."

    After the launch of this movement, the enthusiasm of all open-hearth furnace workers in the plant was mobilized, and a new atmosphere of everyone caring about steelmaking and everyone discussing steelmaking appeared in each open-hearth furnace. Many steelmaking records that were previously considered unbreakable are constantly being broken; some technical operating procedures that were previously regarded as "self-evident" are now being boldly reformed by the masses. After the No. 6 furnace expanded its charging capacity, the phenomenon of slag running and fire blocking was serious, and the smelting time remained above eight hours for a long time. An assistant in this furnace boldly changed the charging method, reducing the smelting time to seven hours and fifty minutes.

    This mass steelmaking movement has promoted the rapid improvement of the steelmaking technical level of all open-hearth furnace workers; a group of new steelmaking experts will quickly grow up in the movement.

### 从窄胡同里走出来  鞍钢一厂变少数人炼钢为人人炼钢

    从窄胡同里走出来
    鞍钢一厂变少数人炼钢为人人炼钢
    据新华社鞍山5日电　鞍钢第一炼钢厂冲破了只有少数人才能炼钢的陈规，正在有组织有领导地开展一个人人参加的群众炼钢运动。这个运动打破了大企业炼钢的神秘观点，调动了所有平炉工人的积极性，显示出工人群众驾驶现代化炼钢技术的无穷智慧和力量。广大群众发动起来，生产情况越来越好。10月17日到26日的十天中，全厂钢的日产量比10月上旬平均增长了八百六十多吨，每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短了四十多分钟。
    第一炼钢厂的群众炼钢运动，是从五号平炉首先开始的。在鞍钢的平炉上，历来是由极少数的炼钢工来炼钢。他们控制着炼钢的整个冶炼过程，炉子上的助手和普通工人只能在炼钢工的指挥下做些炼钢准备工作和炉前、炉后杂活。这种规章，这次被工人冲破了。当五号炉子的炼钢工强调客观困难、认为一炉钢的熔炼时间怎么也突不破八小时的时候，他的助手崔志年就在平炉党支部的支持下挺身出来试炼一炉看看，结果只用六点五十分就炼出了一炉钢。厂的中共党委从这一事例中受到很大启发，深深认识到只有炼钢工才能炼钢的规章已经影响了生产水平的提高。因此，立即抓住这一先进事物的苗头，号召各个平炉学习他们的经验。接着，各个平炉懂得炼钢技术的助手、普通工都纷纷参加炼钢，一个群众炼钢运动就在全厂迅速开展起来了。
    这一运动开始时主要包括三个方面的内容：（一）有独立操作能力的一般工人，进行独立操作指挥炼钢；（二）炼钢工以带徒弟的方式，同助手甚至普通工一起炼一炉钢；（三）集中全炉工人的智慧，集体炼一炉钢。但是，这个运动目前又在继续向前发展。例如过去护炉和热工是由专门的技术人员负责的，现在这个厂的中共党委在“人人炼钢”的基础上，又提出“人人护炉、人人掌握热工技术”的更进一步的行动口号。
    这一运动开展以后，调动了全厂平炉工人的积极性，各个平炉都出现了大家关心炼钢、大家议论炼钢的新风气。很多过去被人认为突不破的炼钢纪录，正在不断地被突破；有些过去被人看作“天经地义”的技术操作规程，现在也被群众大胆地改革了。六号炉扩大装入量后，跑渣挡火现象严重，熔炼时间长期停留在八小时以上，这个炉的一个助手起来大胆改变了装料方法，使熔炼时间减到七点五十分。
    这个群众炼钢运动促使了全体平炉工人迅速提高炼钢技术水平；一批新的炼钢能手将在运动中很快成长起来。
