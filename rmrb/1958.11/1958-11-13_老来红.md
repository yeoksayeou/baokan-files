    "Old Man Reddens"
    After the Shao Yu Township Party Committee in Xihe County, Gansu, issued a call for sports for all in the township, the young people in the township were overjoyed. Even the old men and women over half a century old were thinking about exercising their bodies to prolong their lives. Lu Ziyou, a 73-year-old man, is one of them. He is a labor model of the commune. He is still very energetic when he works, like a person in his forties or fifties. He said: "I suffered from hunger and hardship in the old society since I was a child. I was able to truly become a human being under the leadership of the Communist Party." He often thinks about making himself strong so that he can contribute more to socialism and transition to communism as soon as possible.
    As sports activities unfolded in the township, he followed the young people to learn morning exercises and field exercises, and insisted on exercising regularly. After doing exercises for a period of time, he felt lighter, and his digestion was better than before. Now, he is radiant and works harder, with a happy smile on his face. Because he is good at production and often participates in sports activities, the masses wrote a poem for him: "Old Man Reddens, Old Man Reddens, a hero at seventy-three, surpassing the old Huang Zhong of the past."

    “老来红”
    甘肃西和县稍裕乡党委提出了全乡体育化的号召以后，乡里的青年人乐的不得了，就连那些年过半百的老大爷和老奶奶，都想着把自己的身体锻炼锻炼，好延年益寿。七十三岁的吕自有老人就是其中的一个。他是公社的劳动模范。做起活来还很有劲，像是四五十岁的人一样。他这样说：“我从小就受尽了旧社会的饥苦，在共产党的领导下才算真正做起人来了。”他时常想着让自己身强力壮，能为社会主义多出把力，好早日过渡到共产主义。
    体育活动在乡里展开了，他跟着青年们学早操、作田间操，并坚持经常锻炼。作了一个时期操后，身上感到轻快了，消化也比以前好多了。现在，他精神焕发，做活更有力气，脸上老是露出幸福的微笑。由于他生产上好又经常参加体育活动，群众送给他的一首诗里这样写道：“老来红、老来红，七十三岁当英雄，赛过当年老黄忠。”
