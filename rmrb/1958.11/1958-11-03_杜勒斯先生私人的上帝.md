Mr. Dulles' Private God
By Saslavsky, Soviet Union

John Foster Dulles is using the word God more and more fluently in his diplomatic speeches. One might think that there is a special agency in the U.S. State Department whose function is to weave the word of God into diplomatic reports and presidential speeches. Obviously, the State Department reports precisely imply this meaning, starting as usual with: "We, God and I, are of the opinion that...". Indeed, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish whether Mr. Dulles agrees with God's opinion or God agrees with Dulles' opinion. It seems they often have a meeting of minds.

People might think this is intended to create the impression that American foreign policy is executing God's will: that God thinks the U.S. Sixth Fleet should be sent to Lebanon, that God thinks the Marines should be transferred to other countries' land, that God thinks tension should be created in the Taiwan Strait...

This is exactly what Mr. Dulles explicitly stated: he personally is not against stopping nuclear tests, but he thinks we should listen to God's verdict. In a word, Mr. Dulles has already taken God as his private advisor and the State Department as his foreign policy chapel.

World public opinion does not actually regard this wonderful mixture of diplomacy and the church as anything remarkable. Atheists only find such medieval wording amusing.

However, the Presbyterian Church in the United States does not. For a long time, the Presbyterian Church has endured the embarrassment of using God as an advisor to the State Department. They don't want to endure it any longer.

The American magazine "The Nation" reported on September 13 that the Presbyterian Church's Board of Directors meeting held in Pittsburgh in June severely condemned Mr. Dulles and his foreign policy. The American press did not emphasize this matter at the time, considering it merely an internal church affair. Of course, the significance of the matter is far more than this.

The Presbyterian Church's general assembly discussed American foreign policy from an extraordinary perspective – Mr. Dulles' relationship with God. Here, we will only address the political aspects of this church's special debate, because it is indeed fascinating. Especially because Dulles and the leaders of the Presbyterian Church subsequently exchanged letters, allowing the debate to continue to develop.

The Pittsburgh assembly passed a rather long resolution, believing that there is a significant contradiction between American foreign policy and Christian doctrine and tradition, that the American government is committing the crime of "international hypocrisy," and that true religion advocates peaceful coexistence between the capitalist world and the socialist world, that war is unacceptable, and finally, the resolution believes that both President Eisenhower and the Secretary of State have "betrayed the religion they believe in."

Below is an excerpt from the resolution of the Presbyterian Church's general assembly, which makes it clear that there is no spirit of God in Mr. Dulles' policies:

"When people claim to be Christians but are not prepared to conduct face-to-face discussions with their enemies, they are betraying the religion they believe in. Today, mankind is in a state of tension, and nations are not consulting with each other but are engaged in deceit and forming factions. This is one of our current major dangers…

"Our Father's (referring to God) concept of freedom is also degenerating and corrupting… we are deeply troubled by the contemporary myth of the so-called free world. This country (referring to the United States) believes that there is fundamentally no freedom to speak of in some of its allies. According to our (American) code of conduct, it is openly declared that countries where human freedom has been extinguished can still be included in the scope of the free world, merely because they provide military bases and strategic materials."

The Presbyterian Church is one of the most influential churches in the United States. Both President Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles have special seats in the National Presbyterian Church in Washington.

The resolution of the Pittsburgh assembly naturally put the makers of American policy in a very awkward position. Therefore, the elders of the National Presbyterian Church stood up to defend Eisenhower and Dulles, and Mr. Dulles himself discussed certain chapters of the Bible with some church leaders. He was of course able to find the basis for American foreign policy in one of Jesus's words: "I have come not to bring peace, but a sword."

It is meaningless to predict whether the members of the Presbyterian Church will split into "true Christians" and "betrayers of Christ", or how this debate will proceed. However, the following question is worth noting.

The Presbyterian Church unites many Americans from different social classes and groups, including both workers and millionaires. Like other denominations, policies are made by these millionaires, and the vast majority of believers have always obediently followed their leaders without ever considering that the leaders' prestige might be in question.

However, Dulles has damaged this prestige, and severely damaged it. His brinkmanship policy has brought his church to the brink of division. The members of the Presbyterian Church cannot and will not accept the policies of their "elders"; aggression is incompatible with the principles they believe in.

Mr. Dulles' policies have already isolated the American government internationally and domestically. Because the American people do not need war or brinkmanship. Moreover, Mr. Dulles is also isolated in his own church, because the majority of members in the American Presbyterian Church want peace. Dulles can of course continue to worship his private God – a God who does not change the ugly reality of imperialist aggression.

### 杜勒斯先生私人的上帝

    杜勒斯先生私人的上帝
    苏联　萨斯拉夫斯基
    约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯在外交演说里使用上帝这个词儿真是越来越滚瓜烂熟了。人们可能会认为，美国国务院中有这么一个专门机构，它的职能就是把上帝的话编织到外交报告以及总统演说中去。显而易见，国务院报告里正是暗含着这种意思，开头照例是：“我们，上帝和我，意见是……”。真的，有时很难分辨出究竟是杜勒斯先生同意上帝的意见还是上帝同意杜勒斯的意见。看来，他们经常是灵感相通的。
    人们会想到，这是打算形成一种印象，似乎美国外交政策执行的是上帝的意志：是上帝认为该把美国第六舰队派到黎巴嫩去，是上帝认为该把海军陆战队调往他国土地，是上帝认为该在台湾海峡制造紧张局势……。
    杜勒斯先生正是这样明确表示的，他个人并不反对停止核试验，不过，他认为应该听一听上帝的裁决。一句话，杜勒斯先生已经把上帝当作他的私人顾问，把国务院当作他的外交政策的小教堂。
    对于这种把外交和教堂捏合在一起的奇妙混合物，世界舆论其实并不把它当作什么了不起的事。无神论者听到这种中世纪的词令，只觉好笑而已。
    但是，美国的基督教长老会却并不如此。长时期以来，长老会忍受着这种拿上帝充当国务院顾问的出乖丢丑的事儿。他们不想再继续忍受下去了。
    9月13日的美国“民族”周刊报道说，6月间在匹茨堡举行的长老会理监事会议曾严厉地谴责了杜勒斯先生和他的外交政策。美国报刊当时没有渲染这件事，认为这不过是教会内部事务。当然，事情的意义决不止此。
    长老会的大会是从杜勒斯先生同上帝的关系这样一个非同寻常的角度来讨论美国外交政策的。这里将只涉及这个教会专题论战的政治方面，因为它的确妙趣横生。特别是还因为，杜勒斯和长老会的领袖们此后还交换了信件，使论战继续有所发展。
    匹茨堡大会曾通过一项颇长的决议，认为美国外交政策同基督教教义和传统之间存在着显著的矛盾，认为美国政府犯下“国际范围的假冒为善”的罪行，还认为真正的宗教是主张资本主义世界和社会主义世界和平共处的，认为战争是不能容许的，最后，决议还认为艾森豪威尔总统和国务卿都“背叛了他们所信仰的宗教”。
    下面摘录长老会大会决议的一段，它说得很清楚，在杜勒斯先生的政策中根本就不存在什么上帝的精神：
    “当人们自称信奉基督教但却不准备同他们的仇敌进行面对面的商谈的时候，他们就是背叛了他们所信仰的宗教。今天，人类处于紧张关系中，国家同国家之间不是彼此协商，而是尔虞我诈、营垒分明。这是我们当前主要危险之一……。
    “我们的父（指上帝）的关于自由这一概念也同样在堕落败坏之中……，我们对所谓自由世界这一当代的神话深深感到困惑。这个国家（指美国）认为在它的盟国中有些根本无自由可谈。根据我们（美国）的行动准则，竟然公开宣布那些人类自由已经灭绝的国家仍然能够被列入自由世界范围之内，只是因为它们提供了军事基地和战略物资。”
    长老会是美国影响很大的教会之一。艾森豪威尔总统和杜勒斯先生都在华盛顿的国家长老会教堂中有特设的座席。
    匹茨堡大会的决议当然使得美国政策的制订者处于非常尴尬的处境。于是，国家长老会教会的长老们挺身而出为艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯辩解了一番，杜勒斯先生本人也同一些教会领袖就圣经中某些章节进行了讨论。他从耶稣的一句话里当然能够找到美国外交政策的依据，耶稣说的这句话是：“我来，并不是叫地上太平，乃是叫地上动刀兵。”
    长老会的教友们是否将分裂为“真正的基督徒”和“基督的背叛者”，这种论战会怎样进行下去，预测这些问题的发展并没有什么意思。不过下面这个问题殊可注意。
    长老会团结了不同阶层和社会团体众多的美国人，其中既有工人也有百万富豪，也如同其他教派一样，是这些百万富豪们在制定政策，而广大信徒们一向都是恭顺地追随着他们的领袖而从未考虑领袖的威信还有问题。
    但是，杜勒斯伤害了这种威信，而且是狠狠地伤害了它。他的战争边缘政策把他所属的教会带到了分裂的边缘。长老会教友们不会也不能接受他们的“长老们”的政策，侵略是同他们所信奉的原则不相容的。
    杜勒斯先生的政策已经使得美国政府在国际上陷于孤立，在美国国内亦然。因为美国人民不需要战争和战争边缘。而且，杜勒斯先生在他自己的教会中也孤立了，因为美国长老会中大多数教友要的是和平。杜勒斯当然还可以继续膜拜他私人的上帝——对帝国主义侵略的丑恶现实不加改变的上帝。
