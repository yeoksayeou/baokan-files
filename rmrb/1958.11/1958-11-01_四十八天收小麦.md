A bundle of ordinary wheat is on display in the comprehensive hall. This wheat has large ears and matures in just forty-eight days. Based on its maturity date, wheat could be harvested six times a year.

This bundle of wheat was successfully cultivated using rapid cultivation methods by Yang Qingjun, a biology teacher at Pinghe Second Middle School in Longxi Prefecture, Fujian Province, as part of his work-study program. When cultivating this wheat, Yang Qingjun subjected the seeds to a series of treatments, giving them characteristics such as heat resistance, cold resistance, and drought resistance, allowing them to grow in all seasons. Using these seeds, along with reasonable fertilization and other measures, the first true leaves emerged four days after sowing, and after twenty days, it began to head and flower, and it could be harvested in forty-eight days. Cultivating wheat using this rapid cultivation method speeds up the maturity period by three times compared to ordinary winter-planted wheat.

    四十八天收小麦
    有一束普通的麦子，陈列在综合馆。这种麦子穗头大，四十八天就能生长成熟。按照它的成熟日期，一年可以收六季小麦。
    这束小麦，是福建省龙溪专区平和第二中学的生物教师杨青俊在勤工俭学中，用快速栽培法培植成功的。杨青俊在栽培这种麦子时，对种子进行了一系列的处理，使种子具有耐热、耐寒、耐旱等特性，使它一年四季都可以生长。用这种种子，加上合理施肥等措施，在播种后第四天，长出一片真叶，二十天后开始吐穗扬花，四十八天就可以收割。用这种快速栽培法培植小麦，比一般冬季种植的小麦成熟期加快三倍。
