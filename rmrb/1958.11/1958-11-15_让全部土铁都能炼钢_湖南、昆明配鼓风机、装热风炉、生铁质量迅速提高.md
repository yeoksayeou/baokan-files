According to Xinhua News Agency, in early November, various regions in Hunan Province have gradually improved the quality of pig iron by vigorously promoting the combination of indigenous and foreign methods and innovating technologies. Zixing County, through measures such as improving furnace types and increasing wind power (changing from one bellows to six bellows, and changing from manual bellows to powered blowers), has basically achieved good iron production in every factory and every furnace. On the 10th, the county produced 250.43 tons of iron, of which 153.7 tons were gray cast iron, accounting for more than 60% of the total. Workers at the Maoping Iron Plant in Lianyuan County boldly innovated, building dams along the river, enabling all 22 furnaces to achieve hydraulic blowing, increasing pig iron production by 2.8 times, with gray cast iron accounting for 50%, and reducing 168 smelting workers. After more than 1,100 furnaces in You County achieved mechanized blowing, the output of native blast furnaces generally increased by about 40%, and all produced gray cast iron.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the people of all ethnic groups in Kunming City, on the basis of vigorously developing steel production by implementing the "small-scale native clusters" policy, launched a movement to build small blast furnace clusters with blowing equipment, which rapidly improved the quality of pig iron. Now all the iron produced in the city can be used for steelmaking.

Kunming City has been carrying out the mass movement to build small blast furnaces for more than three months. Tens of thousands of farmers, students, and cadres have been smelting iron while building small blast furnaces. Workers are rushing to manufacture blowers day and night. As of now, more than 100 small blast furnaces have been built in the city, all equipped with blowing equipment or hot blast stoves. These small blast furnaces are distributed in areas rich in coal and iron resources in the city, forming sixteen small blast furnace clusters. These small blast furnace clusters are currently implementing four fixed targets: fixed mining areas, fixed tasks, fixed organizations, and fixed personnel, thus becoming relatively stable iron smelting bases.

As a result of the development of small blast furnace clusters, the quality of pig iron has been greatly improved. Currently, half of the iron produced in the city is white cast iron, which can be used for steelmaking; the other half is gray cast iron, with very low phosphorus and sulfur content, which can be used for both steelmaking and casting.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guiping County in Guangxi Province is universally using sintered iron with less than 90% iron content to re-smelt in furnaces to improve the quality of pig iron. As of November 7, the county's 134 native blast furnaces had processed a total of 750 tons of sintered iron, smelting 420 tons of gray cast iron and white cast iron. In order to promote this experience, the Yulin Special District has convened an on-site meeting in Guiping County.

In October, while smelting iron in native blast furnaces, Guiping County also used native kilns to smelt iron. The native kiln smelting method is simple and has a high output, but in addition to producing some good iron, it also produced a lot of insufficiently reduced sintered iron. Therefore, the Guiping County Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to re-smelt these sintered iron in furnaces.

### 让全部土铁都能炼钢  湖南、昆明配鼓风机、装热风炉、生铁质量迅速提高

    让全部土铁都能炼钢
    湖南、昆明配鼓风机、装热风炉、生铁质量迅速提高
    据新华社讯　湖南省各地在11月上旬通过大搞土洋结合、革新技术，生铁质量已经逐步提高。资兴县通过改进炉型、加大风力（由一个风箱改为六个风箱，改人拉风箱为动力鼓风）等措施，已经基本上做到厂厂炉炉出好铁。10日全县产铁二五○·四三吨，其中灰口铁有一五三·七吨，占总数的60％以上。涟源县毛坪铁厂的职工大胆革新，沿河筑坝，使二十二座炉子全部实现了水力鼓风，生铁产量增加了二·八倍，灰口铁占50％，并且减少了一六八个冶炼工人。攸县一千一百多座炉子实现了鼓风机械化以后，土高炉的产量一般提高40％左右，出的全部是灰口铁。
    新华社讯　昆明市各族人民在贯彻“小土群”方针大闹钢铁生产的基础上，开展建设有鼓风设备的小高炉群的运动，使生铁质量迅速提高，现在全市所产生铁已全部可以炼钢。
    昆明市开展建设小高炉群众运动已有三个多月。十来万农民、学生和干部，一边炼铁，一边兴建小高炉。工人们日夜赶制鼓风机。到目前为止，全市已经建成一百多个小高炉，全部都配上了鼓风设备或热风炉。这些小高炉分布在市内煤铁资源丰富的地方，形成了十六个小高炉群。这些小高炉群目前都实行了四定：定矿区、定任务、定机构和定人员，从而变成了比较固定的炼铁基地。
    发展小高炉群的结果，生铁质量大大提高了。目前全市生产的铁，有一半是白口铁，可以炼钢；另一半是灰口铁，磷、硫的含量很低，既能炼钢，又能铸造。
    据新华社讯　广西桂平县普遍用含铁不到90％的烧结铁回炉重炼，以提高生铁质量，到11月7日，全县一百三十四个土高炉一共处理了烧结铁七百五十吨，炼出灰口铁、白口铁四百二十吨。为了推广这个经验，玉林专区已在桂平县召开了现场会议。
    桂平县10月份在用土高炉炼铁的同时，还采用土窑炼铁。土窑炼铁方法简单，产量高，但是除了生产出部分好铁以外，也生产了许多未经充分还原的烧结铁。因此中共桂平县委决定将这些烧结铁回炉重炼。
