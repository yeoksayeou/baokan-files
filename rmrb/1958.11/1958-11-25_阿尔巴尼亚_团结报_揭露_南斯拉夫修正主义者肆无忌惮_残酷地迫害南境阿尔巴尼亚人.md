The Albanian Democratic Front's newspaper "Unity" recently published an article entitled "The Chauvinistic National Policy of the Yugoslav Revisionists Against Albanians Living in Kosovo, Macedonia, and Montenegro." The article exposes the Yugoslav revisionists' lies about "Yugoslavia adopting the most correct approach to the national question" and "there no longer being a situation of one nation exploiting another in the national question."

    Massacre of Innocent People

The article reveals that in 1944, Tito's confidants – divisions and other units from Macedonia to Kosovo – carried out inhumane massacres in Albanian-populated villages and cities. In the villages of Macedonia, groups of Albanians were shot, and in Tetovo, 10,000 people were arrested, 2,200 of whom were held for years without trial, and many more died in prison. Innocent farmers were killed in the streets and thrown into burning bonfires. The article points out the atrocities committed by Tito's confidants in Drenica, where men were buried alive, children and women were strangled, many died under torture, and the bellies of the dying were cut open and filled with firewood. Several thousand innocent farmers were massacred, including 2,000 shot in Mitrovica and over 1,000 murdered in Gnjilane. Several thousand soldiers who served in the Yugoslav divisions fighting the Nazis were coldly shot. According to eyewitness accounts, it is estimated that around 6,000 Albanians were killed by Tito's forces between 1944 and 1948.

The article emphasizes that the massacres that began in the autumn of 1944 were a suppression of the people, a policy that has not changed and continues today.

    Eliminating True Communists

The article continues to reveal that after 1948, Tito's forces took off their masks and, just as throughout Yugoslavia, began to eliminate true communists. Strong anti-fascist fighter Nexhat Agolli, President of the Kosovo People's Front Rifat Berisha, and "New Life Newspaper" director Galadina Ana were beaten to death in their offices in Pristina. San Xhigoli, veteran guerrilla fighter Faik Pruthi, and many other communists were sent to Belgrade in 1949 and have not been heard from since. Tito's forces paid particular attention to removing those who held leading positions in the Party and government. The article states that in addition to communists, they also arrested patriots and tens of thousands of farmers who did not understand communism. The authorities accused these people of opposing the status quo of the Yugoslav Communist Party, based on intelligence reports. Tito's forces provoked everywhere, killing Albanians in border areas, claiming they were trying to escape. Those who fortunately escaped being shot often fled across the border into Albania.

    Atrocities Reenacted

The article says that in the winter of 1955, just as socialist countries were striving to normalize relations with Yugoslavia, and just as Tito's forces were talking about equality, the atrocities of 1944 were reenacted in Kosovo.

From the end of 1955 to the beginning of 1957, the Yugoslav government, under the pretext of collecting weapons, took savage actions throughout the Kosovo region. Tito's forces surrounded villages with troops, herded men into rooms like livestock, demanded weapons they did not actually have, and then drove them into the courtyard to be searched by the police. It is estimated that at least 50% of the people were arrested by the authorities, and many of them died under torture.

The methods adopted by Tito's forces to eliminate national boundaries are varied. Yugoslavia conducted three censuses in 1945, 1948, and 1952. After each survey, the number of Albanians decreased significantly. In the census, local authorities received orders to use all their power to register Albanians as Turks or Macedonians. A Macedonian officer, Mustafa Lesi, admitted that in 1946, a top-secret telegram came from Belgrade ordering that Albanians be registered as Turks or Macedonians as much as possible.

The article concludes by pointing out that the attitude of the Tito-led leadership group towards the Albanian minority is a serious crime of revisionists, and this is their true face. The Albanian working people and the Albanian Democratic Front are united as one, supporting the correct attitude adopted by the Albanian Labor Party on the Kosovo issue, exposing these inhumane crimes to public opinion and the people of Yugoslavia oppressed by the dollar-fed Tito clique, and demanding that their brothers be treated with equality and justice.

    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”揭露
    南斯拉夫修正主义者肆无忌惮  残酷地迫害南境阿尔巴尼亚人
    本报讯　阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线机关报“团结报”，最近发表了一篇文章，题目是“南斯拉夫修正主义者对居住在考索伏、马其顿和门地内哥罗的阿尔巴尼亚人实行的沙文主义民族政策”。文章揭穿了南斯拉夫修正主义者所谓“南斯拉夫在民族问题上采取最正确的方式”，“在民族问题上不再存在一个民族剥削另一个民族”之类的鬼话。
    大批屠杀无辜的人民
    文章揭露说，1944年，铁托的亲信——从马其顿到考索伏去的师团和其他一些师团，在阿尔巴尼亚人居住的乡村和城市里进行了惨无人道的大屠杀。在马其顿的村子里，成群的阿尔巴尼亚人遭到枪杀，在泰泰伏有一万人被逮捕，其中有二千二百人几年不加审判，更多的人死在监狱里。无辜的农民被杀害在街头，被投入焚烧着的火堆。文章指出了铁托的亲信在达拉尼察所犯的暴行。那里的男人被活埋，孩子和妇女被勒死，很多人在酷刑中死去，垂死的人的肚子被剖开，里面点着木柴。好几千无辜的农民被屠杀，其中在米特洛维察有二千人被枪杀，在吉兰有一千多人被害。几千个在南斯拉夫师团服役打击纳粹的战士，被冷酷地枪杀了。据目击者供给的材料，估计在1944年到1948年之间，被铁托分子杀害的阿尔巴尼亚人有六千人左右。
    文章强调指出，在1944年秋天开始的屠杀，是镇压人民，这个政策以往没有改变，今天还在继续。
    消灭真正的共产党员
    文章继续揭露说，1948年以后，铁托分子揭开了假面具，正像在南斯拉夫全国一样，他们开始消灭真正的共产党员。反法西斯主义的坚强战士奈克萨特·阿哥利，考索伏人民阵线主席里法特·贝利沙，“新生报”社长加拉第纳·阿纳，他们在柏利斯底那地方的办公室里被打死。桑·希格利，老游击战士法克·普鲁底和其他很多共产党员在1949年被押送到贝尔格莱德，以后就没有下落了。铁托分子特别注意除去那些在党和政府中居领导地位的人们。文章说，除了共产党员以外，他们还逮捕爱国者以及成千上万的对共产主义并不了解的农民。当局控告说，根据情报，这些人反对南斯拉夫共产党的现状。铁托分子到处挑衅，他们杀害边境地区的阿尔巴尼亚人，说他们企图逃亡。常有幸免遭到枪杀的人越境逃到阿尔巴尼亚国内。
    暴行又在重演
    文章说，1955年冬天，正当社会主义国家尽力使自己和南斯拉夫的关系正常起来的时候，正当铁托分子高谈平等的时候，1944年的暴行又在考索伏重演。
    从1955年底到1957年初，南斯拉夫政府在集中武器的借口之下，在整个考索伏地区采取了野蛮的行动。铁托分子用军队包围了村庄，把男人像牲口一样圈在房间里，向他们要他们实际上并没有的武器，然后将他们驱逐到院子里由警察搜身。据估计，至少有50％的人被当局逮捕，其中有很多人在酷刑中死去。
    铁托分子采取的消除民族界线的方法是多种多样的。南斯拉夫在1945年、1948年和1952年进行过三次户口登记。每次调查以后，阿尔巴尼亚人的数目就大大减少。在户口调查中，地方当局接到命令，用一切力量把阿尔巴尼亚人登记成土耳其人或梅塞多尼亚人。马其顿的一位军官穆斯塔法·莱西承认，1946年贝尔格莱德来绝密电报，要尽可能把阿尔巴尼亚人登记成土耳其人或梅塞多尼亚人。
    文章最后指出，以铁托为首的领导集团，对待阿尔巴尼亚少数民族的态度是修正主义者的严重罪行，这就是他们的真正嘴脸。阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民和阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线团结得像一个人一样，支持阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在考索伏问题上所采取的正确的态度，向公众舆论和受着用美元喂养的铁托集团压迫的南斯拉夫人民揭穿这些惨无人道的罪行，要求以平等、正义来对待自己的兄弟。
