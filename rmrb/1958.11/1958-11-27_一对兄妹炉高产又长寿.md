A Pair of Sibling Furnaces Yield High Output and are Long-Lived
By Chen Yuman, Director of the May Fourth Youth Iron Plant, Dongfeng People's Commune, Macheng, Hubei

In the May Fourth Youth Iron Plant of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Macheng County, Hubei, there is a pair of renowned small blast furnaces: one is the Huang Jiguang Furnace built by young men, and the other is the Liu Hulan Furnace built by young women. This pair of sibling furnaces is known as the "earth furnace kings" that are "high-yielding and long-lived." However, when they were first built, they were opposed and ridiculed by conservatives.

Defeat the Old Conservatives and Win the First Battle

When the township party committee and the Communist Youth League branch selected ten young people, including party member Zhu Shunlu and Communist Youth League member Zhan Zeyi, to prepare for the establishment of an iron plant at the foot of Tianzi Mountain, they were met with cold sarcasm from conservatives as soon as they spoke. Someone composed a jingle to satirize them: "Poor mountains, foul water, and poor technology; building an iron plant is too difficult. With little labor force in the Great Leap Forward year, this proposal is but a dream!" An old man named Chen also didn't believe it, vowing, "If you really smelt iron, I will crawl around in front of the furnace several times." However, the fiery hearts of the young people were not frozen by these cold words. Under the leadership of party members and Communist Youth League members and with the strong support of the masses, the construction of the plant proceeded rapidly. When there were no houses, commune member Li Guozheng gave up his own house; when there was no yellow mud, Li Guangcai ran through three fields, four gullies, and eight mountains in one day to find yellow mud; when there were no refractory materials, Chen Guoxiang crossed mountains and ridges, running ninety-five li overnight to Yanhe Baita to bring back red sandstone; when there were no bellows, Communist Youth League member Chen Yongchang went to the Aofenghe Iron Plant seven times in two days and nights to get bellows; when there was no grain, everyone went home to bring back eight thousand seven hundred jin of pumpkins to eat. No difficulty could deter heroes. After a period of arduous struggle, the earthen blast furnace was built.

On August 21, the Youth Huang Jiguang No. 1 small blast furnace began smelting. The first time, the bellows broke and no iron was produced; the second time, the furnace burned down, and a pile of yellow mud and black charcoal mud sprayed out of the furnace. At this time, some conservatives who were standing by the furnace watching the "outcome" spoke up again, saying, "Youngsters don't listen to elders; they want to fly before they can walk steadily. Who can smelt iron in the mountains!" The young people's faces turned red, feeling both sad and unconvinced. They unswervingly carried out the third arduous battle. Communist Party member Li Guangcai kept drilling into the high-temperature furnace hearth, using charcoal mud to plaster the furnace hearth, and Communist Youth League member Zhan Zeyi reinstalled the furnace door. The newly plastered mud on the furnace was not dry, so the young people rushed to Xiao Family Mountain in the dark to bring back several loads of charcoal, built a shed, and lit a fire overnight to bake it. After the furnace hearth was baked dry, they started smelting again the next day.

The iron water of the small blast furnace roared as the blower blew, and people waited nervously. When it was time to tap the iron, Zhan Zeyi poked the furnace door tongue with a stick, and the iron water flowed out with a whoosh! At this time, the conservatives looked at each other in silence.

Study Hard and Drill Diligently to Break Through Technical Barriers

It was indeed not easy to smelt iron with earthen furnaces. These two small blast furnaces had only two old technicians in their sixties. They had to rest for a few days after working for a few days, and when they rested, the furnace had to be shut down. Through building the furnace, the young people had only learned general techniques, and the old masters did not seriously teach many key techniques, such as batching, stirring, and inserting the tuyere. In order to learn the techniques, the young people tried everything possible to improve their relationship with the masters. They cared for and cared for the masters in their daily lives; they fetched water for the masters to wash their faces and feet in the morning and evening, and served tea and rice during the day. The young women took time to mend the masters' broken shoes, making the masters feel warm in all aspects. Not only that, but everyone also paid great attention to helping the masters improve their awareness politically, often reading newspapers to the masters. Once, when reading about how some old masters had trained one hundred apprentices who knew nothing into three or four level workers with theoretical knowledge and practical operation skills in three months, the old master Xie Changru was also moved and said, "My skills were originally passed on to my own sons and sons-in-law, but you treat me even better than my own relatives. As long as you are willing to learn, I will definitely teach you everything I know." So the young people signed contracts with the masters to teach and learn, and studied intensively. Those who pulled the bellows during work helped with the work in front of the furnace after work; when the masters were stirring, they would lie on the ground to watch. The young girl Ou Xingmei, who was less than sixteen years old, always bolted the door when others were resting in order to learn how to pull the bellows, learning to walk the steps of pulling the bellows. This is how they learned the complete set of technical operating procedures such as stirring, inserting the tuyere, batching, and watching the fire color.

Red Flag Competition: Learn From Each Other and Compete for High Standards

The great news of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's blast furnace producing iron inspired everyone. After the female furnace director and Communist Youth League member Li Shuqin returned from attending the iron production celebration ceremony, she made a report at the branch meeting, guaranteeing to the branch that she would increase the daily iron production to two thousand jin, and launched a competition within the group for everyone to strive to be a model. As soon as she finished speaking, Zhan Zeyi, the furnace director of Huang Jiguang No. 1 furnace and deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, immediately stood up to challenge: "Not only should we carry out competition between people, but we should also have a competition between our two furnaces." Li Shuqin said: "Okay! Our women will not lag behind, let's compete." The two furnaces each put forward fighting slogans. The competition began, and the Liu Hulan No. 1 furnace first used the method of assault water hauling to pull the bellows, with frequent shift changes, sufficient wind power, high fire, and fast charcoal feeding. Therefore, they tapped the iron one hundred and seven jin earlier than the Huang Jiguang furnace by more than ten minutes. At this time, the female furnace director Li Shuqin picked up the loudspeaker and shouted to the Jiguang furnace:

        Jiguang furnace, listen clearly, the girls' enthusiasm breaks the top, the furnace produces one hundred and seven jin of iron, exceeding your steel production.

The young people in the Jiguang furnace were anxious, their faces flushed. The furnace director Zhan Zeyi also picked up the loudspeaker and replied: Little girls, don't show off. What does it matter if you surpassed us once? If we don't surpass you in the next furnace, we won't stop working hard.

After the Huang Jiguang furnace director shouted, he led the team members to learn from the female blast furnace's experience. The female furnace director frankly told them. The Huang Jiguang No. 1 furnace immediately adopted their method, and at the same time repaired the bellows, changing from two people pulling to three people pulling. As a result, the Huang Jiguang No. 1 furnace tapped the iron four minutes earlier than the Liu Hulan No. 1 furnace, and the output increased from one hundred and twenty-six jin to one hundred and fifty jin, which was forty-three jin higher than the female blast furnace. The Huang Jiguang furnace took the lead, and the competition red flag was inserted from the female blast furnace to the Huang Jiguang furnace.

After the first round, both furnaces established daily output improvement research groups to actively prepare for the competition. The two furnace directors met to exchange information, learning from each other's strengths and making up for their weaknesses. As a result of the second furnace competition, the Liu Hulan No. 1 furnace tapped the iron two minutes earlier, and the furnace output increased from one hundred and seven jin to one hundred and seventy-seven jin, which was twenty-seven jin higher than the Huang Jiguang furnace. The Liu Hulan No. 1 furnace took the lead again. The girls in the whole furnace sang excitedly:

        Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulties, steel is strong and our hearts are firm, the iron water flows like the sea, the female generals have surpassed the men.

The young men in the Huang Jiguang No. 1 furnace immediately replied when they heard the girls singing like this: "It doesn't matter, we will grab the red flag back immediately." Finally, the Huang Jiguang No. 1 furnace won again with a furnace output of one hundred and ninety-one jin and twelve liang, tapping the iron six minutes earlier and producing fifteen jin more iron than the girls.

Time passed minute by minute, and the competition between the two small blast furnaces became more and more intense. The daily iron production increased accordingly, and from then on, the fame of this pair of sibling furnaces spread among the people.

    一对兄妹炉高产又长寿
    湖北麻城东风人民公社五四青年铁厂厂长　陈玉满
    湖北麻城县东风人民公社五四青年铁厂里，有一对声名赫赫的小高炉：一座是青年小伙子们建的黄继光炉；另一座是姑娘们建的刘胡兰炉。这一对兄妹炉被人们称为“高产又长寿”的“土炉王”。但是，刚修建的时候，它们却遭到过保守派的反对讪笑。
    战胜老保守　打赢第一仗
    当乡党团总支选拔了党员朱顺禄和共青团员占泽义等十个青年，到天子山脚下去筹办铁厂时，话刚说出口，就遭到了保守派的冷讽热嘲。有人编了顺口溜讽刺说：“穷山臭水技术差，兴建铁厂困难大，跃进年中劳力少，这个倡议是梦想吧！”一个姓陈的老头也不相信，他发誓说：“你们要真是炼出了铁，我在炉前倒爬几个转”。但是年轻人的火热的心并没有被这冰冷的言语冻结。在党团员的带头和群众的大力支持下，建厂工作迅速地开展起来了。没有房子，社员李国正将自己的住房让了出来，没有黄泥巴，李光才一天跑了三畈四冲八座山，找到了黄泥；没有耐火材料，陈国香翻山越岭一夜跑九十五里到阎河白塔，打回了红砂石；没有风箱，共青团员陈永昌两天两夜七上坳峰河铁厂弄来了风箱；没有粮食，各人回家弄来了八千七百斤南瓜当饭吃。千难万难，难不住英雄汉。经过一番苦战，土高炉建成了。
    8月21号青年黄继光一号小高炉就开始了冶炼。第一次把风箱拉断了，没有出铁；第二次又把炉子烧跨了，炉里的黄泥巴和黑炭子泥喷出了一大堆。这时站在炉旁看
  “究竟”的一些保守派，又开口了，说什么：“细仔不听老人言，走路不稳就想飞。高山里头谁能炼出铁来！”青年们听着个个脸都涨的通红，又难过，又不服气。他们毫不灰心地进行了第三次苦战。共产党员李光才一个劲的钻进高温炉缸，用炭子泥糊好了炉缸，共青团员占泽义重新安装了炉门。炉上新糊的泥没有干，青年们就摸黑赶路到肖家山挑来了几挑炭，搭起棚子，连夜烧起火来烤，炉缸烤干了，第二天又开始了冶炼。
    小高炉的铁水被鼓风机吹得呼呼响，人们紧张地期待着。出铁的时候到了，占泽义用棍戳了一下炉门舌，铁水哗的一声流了出来！这时保守派都面面相观，一声不响了。
    苦学又苦钻　突破技术关
    黄泥巴腿子要炼出铁来，的确是一件不容易的事情。这两座小高炉，只有两个六十多岁的老技工。他们劳动几天，就要休息几天，一休息，炉子就要停火。通过建炉，青年们只学到了一般性的技术，许多关键的技术，如配料，打搅棍，进炉管等技术活，老师傅就不认真教。为了学到技术，青年们想尽了一切办法去搞好师徒关系。他们在生活上关心体贴师傅；早晚给师傅打水洗脸洗脚，白天端茶盛饭，姑娘们抽空给师傅补破鞋，使师傅从各方面感到温暖。不光这样，大家还十分注意从政治上去帮助师傅提高觉悟，经常读报给师傅听。有一次在读到有些老师傅在三个月的时间内，把一百个一窍不通的学徒培养成有理论知识、会实际操作的三、四级工人时，老师傅谢长如也感动地说：“我的技术本来是传授亲生儿子、女婿的，可是你们对我比亲人还要亲，只要你们肯学，我一定把肚子里的东西全部教给你们。”于是青年们就和师傅订立了包教包学合同，突击学习。上班拉风箱的，下班后，就帮助炉前做活；师傅打搅棍时，他们便伏到地下去看。不满十六岁的小姑娘欧杏梅，为了学会拉风箱，别人休息，她总是把门闩上，学着走拉风箱的步子。他们就是这样来学会打搅棍、进炉管、配料、看火色等全套技术操作规程。
    红旗大竞赛　互学比高低
    武钢高炉出铁这件大喜事，激励了大家。参加出铁庆祝典礼的女炉长、共青团员李淑琴回来以后，在支部大会上作了传达，向支部保证要把铁的日产量提高到二千斤，并在组内开展人人争取做模范的竞赛活动。她的话一说完，黄继光一号炉炉长、团支部副书记占泽义马上站起来应战道：“不仅要开展人与人之间的竞赛，我们两炉之间也来个竞赛。”李淑琴说：“好呀！我们妇女也不落后，竞赛就竞赛。”两个炉各自提出了战斗口号。竞赛开始了，刘胡兰一号炉首先改用突击车水的方法来拉风箱，换班勤，风力足，火头高，下炭快，因此，比黄继光炉提前十多分钟出铁一百零七斤。这时，女炉长李淑琴拿起了广播筒对着继光炉喊道：
    继光炉上你听清，姑娘干劲破大顶，炉产生铁一百零七斤，钢铁生产超你们。
    继光炉的青年们着急了，个个脸上通红，炉长占泽义也拿起了广播筒回答：小小姑娘莫逞能，赶过一次算的甚，下炉要是不胜过你，苦战实干不收兵。
    黄继光炉长喊了后，便带着组员去学习女高炉的经验。女炉长坦率地告诉他们。黄继光一号炉马上采用了她们的方法，同时修理了风箱，改两人拉为三人拉。结果，黄继光一号炉比刘胡兰一号炉提前四分钟出了铁，产量由一百二十六斤提高到一百五十斤，比女高炉高四十三斤，黄继光炉占了先，竞赛红旗由女高炉插到了黄继光炉上来了。
    第一回合后，两个炉子都分别成立了日产量提高研究小组，积极准备竞赛。两个炉长碰头交换了情况，彼此取长补短。第二炉竞赛的结果，刘胡兰一号炉提前两分钟出了铁，炉产由一百零七斤提高到一百七十七斤，比黄继光炉高出二十七斤，刘胡兰一号炉又一次占先。全炉的姑娘们兴奋的唱起来：
    不怕苦来不怕难，钢铁坚来心也坚，铁水奔流似大海，女将已经胜过男子汉。
    黄继光一号炉的小伙子们，听姑娘们这么一唱，马上回答道：“不要紧，红旗我们马上要抢过来。”最后，黄继光一号炉又以炉产一百九十一斤十二两，比姑娘们提前六分钟多出十五斤铁，而取得了胜利。
    时间一分又一分的过去，两个小高炉之间的竞赛，愈来愈激烈。铁的日产量随之往上升着，从此这一对兄妹炉的英名，也在人们中间传扬开了。
