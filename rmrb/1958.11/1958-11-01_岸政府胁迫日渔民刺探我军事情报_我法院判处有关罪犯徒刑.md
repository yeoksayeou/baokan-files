Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 31st: The Shanghai Intermediate People's Court announced today: Based on the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries," the fishing masters of the Japanese fishing vessels "Himekawa Maru" and "Mishima Maru," Yoshio Kinoshita, who intruded into our coastal areas to spy on military intelligence, were sentenced to four years imprisonment; and the telegraph operator, Yukio Kinoshita, was sentenced to three years imprisonment. The two Japanese fishing vessels, "Himekawa Maru" and "Mishima Maru," were ordered to be confiscated.

The "Himekawa Maru" and "Mishima Maru" were arrested by our navy ships on May 6th of this year after intruding into China's restricted area for motorized trawling. According to Yoshio Kinoshita and Yukio Kinoshita, the two fishing vessels illegally intruded into our military restricted zones and motorized trawling restricted areas 21 times from 1955 to May of this year. They carried out instructions from the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency to spy on the movements of our navy ships and aircraft, the military facilities on coastal islands, and the water depth, bottom quality, and currents near our coast.

As early as 1954, Yoshio Kinoshita and Yukio Kinoshita had already spied on the intelligence of our navy ships and aircraft on the sea north of Jiangsu and outside the Yangtze River estuary, and also detected the telegraph call signs of our navy ships and aircraft. In the winter of 1956, the two criminals also reported the situation of our navy ships sailing in the southern Yellow Sea to the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency. In addition, Yoshio Kinoshita and Yukio Kinoshita damaged our fishermen's fishing gear six times while intruding into the waters of Wenzhou Bay, Dachen Island, and the Taishan Islands. After being arrested, the two criminals attempted to deny their crimes and even destroyed some of the evidence.

In February of this year, under the instigation of the U.S. intelligence agencies stationed in Japan, the Maritime Safety Agency of the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government, in order to intensify the deployment of reconnaissance of our military intelligence, convened a meeting of some heads of Japanese fishing companies, forcing some crew members of Japanese fishing vessels to collect our military intelligence activities. The Japanese Maritime Safety Agency instructed some Japanese fishing vessels to approach the waters near our Dongfushan Island, Huadaoshan Island, Jiushan Islands, Yushan, and Taishan Islands at all costs to collect intelligence on the types, movements, and equipment of our navy ships and aircraft, especially to scout the fortresses, artillery positions, airports, barracks, radar, and telecommunications equipment on our coastal islands. The Japanese Maritime Safety Agency also provided military reconnaissance and communication equipment such as dedicated codes, contact call signs, long-range cameras, and precision telescopes to Japanese fishing vessels engaged in military intelligence activities, and instructed Japanese crew members engaged in intelligence activities that if they were discovered by our side and once arrested by our side, they must destroy all evidence.

According to confirmed materials, in March and April of this year, Japanese crew members who accepted intelligence missions had taken photos of military facilities on our Yushan, Jiushan, Dongfushan, Tongdao and other islands and sent them to the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency. The Japanese Maritime Safety Agency also sent these military intelligence to the intelligence agencies of the U.S. military stationed in Japan.

The Shanghai Intermediate People's Court considered that Yoshio Kinoshita and Yukio Kinoshita committed espionage crimes under the coercion of the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government's Maritime Safety Agency, and therefore decided to grant lenient sentences.

    岸政府胁迫日渔民刺探我军事情报
    我法院判处有关罪犯徒刑
    新华社上海31日电　上海市中级人民法院今天宣布：根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，判处侵入我国沿海附近，刺探军事情报的日本渔轮姬岛丸、美岛丸的渔捞长木下义雄徒刑四年，电报员木下幸男徒刑三年。姬岛丸和美岛丸两艘日本渔轮判处没收。
    姬岛丸和美岛丸是在今年5月6日侵入我国机轮拖网渔业禁渔区之后，被我国海军舰艇逮捕的。据木下义雄和木下幸男供称：该两艘渔轮从1955年起到今年5月止，曾先后非法侵入我军事警戒区、机轮拖网渔业禁渔区达二十一次之多。他们执行日本海上保安厅的指示，刺探我国海军舰艇和飞机的动态、沿海岛屿的军事设施，以及我国海岸附近水深底质和潮流等情况。
    木下义雄和木下幸男早在1954年就刺探过江苏北部海面和长江口外我国海军舰艇和飞机动态的情报，还探测过我海军舰艇和飞机的电报呼号。1956年冬季，该两犯还将我国海军在黄海南部航行的舰艇情况，报告日本海上保安厅。此外，木下义雄和木下幸男在侵入我国温州湾、大陈岛、台山列岛等海面时，曾破坏我渔民的渔具六次。被捕后，该两犯企图抵赖自己的罪行，竟毁灭了一部分罪证。
    今年2月，日本岸信介政府的海上保安厅在美国驻日特务机关的指使下，为了加紧部署对我国军事情报的侦察，曾召集一部分日本渔业公司的负责人开会，强迫日本渔轮的一部分船员进行收集我国军事情报的活动。日本海上保安厅指使一部分日本渔轮，不顾一切地逼近我国东福山岛、花岛山岛、韭山列岛、渔山和台山列岛附近的海面，收集有关我国海军舰艇和飞机的类型、动向和装备等情报，特别是侦察我国沿海岛屿上的要塞、炮位、机场、兵营、雷达和电讯设备等情况。日本海上保安厅还将专用密码和联络呼号、远距离镜头的照相机、精密的望远镜等军事侦察通讯器材发给进行军事情报活动的日本渔轮，并且指示从事情报活动的日本船员，在进行军事情报活动中，若被我方发觉和一旦被我方逮捕，必须毁灭一切罪证。
    根据材料证实，今年3、4月，接受情报任务的日本船员已将我渔山、韭山、东福山、童岛等岛屿上的军事设施摄成照片，送交日本海上保安厅。日本海上保安厅还将这些军事情报送给驻日美军的特务机关。
    上海市中级人民法院考虑到，木下义雄和木下幸男是在日本岸信介政府海上保安厅的强迫下犯下间谍罪行的，因此，决定予以从宽判处。
