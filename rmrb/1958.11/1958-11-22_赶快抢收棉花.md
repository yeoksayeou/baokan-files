    Hurry to Harvest Cotton
    On the 18th, during the day, we took express train No. 46 from Chengdu to Beijing. Passing through western Henan, in places like Shanxian, Lingbao, Xin'an, and Mianchi, we saw that in some fields, parts of the abundant harvest had not been promptly gathered from the fields. The cotton bloomed snow-white, but very few people were picking it, resulting in some cotton fibers becoming quite long and falling to the ground. Some cornfields, although the corn had been harvested and wheat planted, still had piles and piles of corn ears stacked beside the fields, not yet transported home.
    When the train stopped, we asked the local farmers: Why haven't the cotton and corn been harvested? They said: They can't spare the manpower to pick cotton and transport corn; some have elementary school students helping to pick, but they don't pick very cleanly, and the waste from scattering is severe! We heard that a few days ago, it had rained for several days here. Thinking about the damage to these abundant harvests from the wind and rain, it really breaks our hearts!
    Now that completing the steel production plan is guaranteed, the Central Committee has instructed that a portion of the steelmaking army should quickly transfer to the agricultural front to do a good job in autumn harvesting and planting. We hope that the local people's communes, while vigorously engaging in steel production, can comprehensively arrange labor, make a concentrated effort on autumn harvesting and storage, and quickly bring in the abundant harvests!

### 赶快抢收棉花

    赶快抢收棉花
    18日白天，我们乘四十六次快车从成都到北京，经过河南西部，在陕县、灵宝、新安、渑池等地，看到在一些地里，部分丰收的果实，还没有及时从田野上抢收回来。棉花开得一片雪白，但是，还很少有人采摘，以致有的棉絮扯的多长，掉在地下。有些包谷地，虽然早已收下包谷，种上麦子，可是，包谷穗还成堆成堆的放在地边上，没有运回家来。
    停车时，我们曾问到当地农民：为什么棉花、包谷还没有收回来？他们说：腾不出人手来摘棉花，运包谷；有的虽有小学生帮助收摘，但收的很不干净，抛撒损失很厉害！我们听说，两三天前，这儿曾下了几天雨。想到这些丰收果实，在风雨中受到的损失，叫人真心痛呵！
    现在完成钢铁生产计划已有保证，中央已指示炼钢大军有一部分要迅速转到农业战线上来，搞好秋收秋种工作，我们希望当地人民公社，在大搞钢铁的同时，能全盘安排劳动力，突击秋收秋藏工作，赶快把丰收的果实收回来！
