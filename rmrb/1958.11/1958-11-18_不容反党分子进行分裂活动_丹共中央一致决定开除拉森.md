Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 16th: Copenhagen dispatch: The new Central Committee elected by the 20th Congress of the Danish Communist Party held a meeting on the 15th, at which it unanimously decided to expel the party's former chairman, Larsen, from the party.

    The meeting issued a statement condemning Larsen's anti-party activities. The statement pointed out that Larsen had flagrantly violated the Party Constitution, placing himself above the Party. He violated the principle of a working-class party that party members must abide by resolutions passed by party organizations, and went even further to surrender to news organizations engaged in anti-communist propaganda to oppose the party.

    Prior to this meeting of the Central Committee, Larsen had delivered speeches attacking the Danish Communist Party in many places in Denmark, including Esbjerg, Kolding, and Odense, and colluded with traitors to engage in activities to split the party, attempting to organize a new party. On the 14th, he even told a reporter from the Danish bourgeois newspaper "Politiken": "I cannot, for the sake of party discipline, uphold something I believe is wrong." He also slandered the political resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Danish Communist Party.

    While expelling Larsen from the party, the meeting demanded that he hand over his parliamentary seat representing the Danish Communist Party, but Larsen indicated that he was unwilling to do so.

    不容反党分子进行分裂活动
    丹共中央一致决定开除拉森
    新华社柏林16日电　哥本哈根消息：丹麦共产党第二十次代表大会选出的新中央委员会在15日举行了会议，会上一致决定把党的前主席拉森开除出党。
    会议发表了一项声明，谴责拉森的反党活动。声明指出，拉森粗暴地违反了党章，把自己个人置于党之上。他违反工人阶级政党关于党的成员必须服从党组织所通过的决议的原则，更进而向进行反共宣传的新闻机构投降，来反对党。
    在中央委员会的这次会议前，拉森曾经先后在丹麦的厄斯堡、科陵和鄂丹斯等许多地方发表攻击丹麦共产党的演说，并且同叛徒勾结在一起，进行分裂党的活动，企图组织新党。14日，他更向丹麦资产阶级报纸“政治报”记者发表谈话说：“我不能由于党纪的原因，来维护我认为是错误的东西。”他还毁谤丹麦共产党第二十次大会的政治决议。
    在开除拉森党籍的同时，会议要求他向党交出他代表丹麦共产党在议会中的议席，但是拉森表示他不愿意交出。
