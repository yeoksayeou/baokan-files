Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 22nd: Nozaka Sanzo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement in the "Akahata" today, expressing a heartfelt welcome to the statement made by Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi. He said, for the sake of the future of the Japanese nation and the peace of Asia, we fully support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement. He called on the Japanese people to join hands with the Chinese people to launch a common struggle against the common enemy of the two peoples, U.S. imperialism, and drive U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan and Japan.

Nozaka said that just as the majority of the Japanese people are worried that the Kishi Nobusuke government is about to conclude a Japan-U.S. "joint defense treaty" with U.S. imperialism, Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement frankly stated the Chinese people's views on this issue.

Nozaka pointed out that since Japan and the United States concluded the San Francisco "Peace Treaty", the Japanese people have been fighting for a truly independent, peaceful and democratic Japan, and the Japanese Communist Party has always stood at the forefront of the struggle. He said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement is completely in line with the wishes of the Japanese people.

Nozaka sternly condemned Kishi Nobusuke government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information and Culture Bureau Director Kondo Shinichi's remarks on Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement. Nozaka pointed out that the Chinese people have suffered long-term and tragic aggression by Japanese imperialism, and Kishi Nobusuke has recently blatantly revealed his conspiracy to re-invade China. Under such circumstances, the Chinese government cannot but speak out for the interests of the Chinese people and the peace of Asia. The so-called "interference in internal affairs" is a fallacy that reverses right and wrong. Nozaka said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement is fully in line with the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.

Nozaka then strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government and its reactionary groups for assisting U.S. imperialism in occupying China's territory of Taiwan, interfering in China's internal affairs, and acting as a running dog of U.S. imperialism, bringing wolves into the house, and tolerating U.S. imperialism's interference in Japan's internal affairs.

Nozaka pointed out that as long as the Kishi Nobusuke government continues to follow the United States on this old road, Japan will become increasingly isolated and eventually fall into an inextricable quagmire. Nozaka pointed out that getting rid of the shackles of U.S. imperialism and becoming a completely independent and peaceful country is the only way for Japan to move towards prosperity. Only in this way can Japan obtain an equal position in international relations.

    独立和平民主是日本人民的愿望
    野坂参三表示衷心欢迎我陈毅外长声明
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三今天在“赤旗报”上发表谈话，表示衷心欢迎中国外交部长陈毅的声明。他说，为了日本民族的将来和亚洲的和平，我们全面支持陈毅外长的声明。他号召日本人民同中国人民携起手来，对两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义展开共同斗争，把美帝国主义从台湾和日本驱逐出去。
    野坂说，正当日本大多数人民耽心岸信介政府要同美帝国主义缔结日美“共同防御条约”的时候，陈毅外长的声明坦白地说出了中国人民对这个问题的见解。
    野坂指出，自从日美缔结旧金山“和约”以来，日本人民就一直在为争取真正的独立、和平和民主的日本而展开斗争，日本共产党一向站在斗争的最前列。他说，陈毅外长的声明是同日本人民这样的愿望完全一致的。
    野坂严辞谴责了岸信介政府外务省情报文化局局长近藤晋一对陈毅外长的声明所发表的谈话。野坂指出，中国人民受到了日本帝国主义长期的悲惨的侵略，岸信介最近又露骨地表明了他要重新侵略中国的阴谋，在这样的情况下，中国政府为了中国人民的利益和亚洲的和平，是不能不开口的，所谓“干涉内政”是颠倒是非的谬论。野坂说，陈毅外长的声明是完全符合和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的精神的。
    野坂接着强烈谴责岸信介政府及其反动集团协助美帝国主义霸占中国领土台湾，干涉中国内政，并且充当美帝国主义的走狗，引狼入室，容忍美帝国主义干涉日本内政。
    野坂指出，只要岸信介政府追随美国继续走这条老路，日本将越加孤立，最后将陷入拔不出的泥沼中。野坂指出，摆脱美帝国主义的束缚，成为完全独立的和平国家，这是日本走向繁荣的唯一道路。只有这样，日本才能在国际关系上得到平等的地位。
