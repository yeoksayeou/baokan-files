Home慰劳队

　　Late at night, the nine members of Qingdao folk art veteran Liu Taiqing's family were sitting around in a simple but clean little house. The old artist Liu Taiqing said, "Tonight, let's have a family meeting to discuss our 'battle plan' on the steel front."
　　The innocent, lively, and forthright second daughter, Liu Shuqin, spoke first, saying, "I guarantee to run to more construction sites, perform more often, and create more, to compete with you."
　　The third son, Liu Jixiang, said slowly and deliberately, "Besides completing the accompaniment, I guarantee to smash 300 jin of ore every day."
　　Liu Jixiang's fiancée, Zhu Meihua, the eldest daughter, Liu Liqin, and the twelve-year-old fourth daughter, Liu Aiqin, also requested to go to the "front line," even though they had never performed folk art before. Most exciting of all, the six-year-old little girl, Liu Yanqin, also mumbled and shouted, "I want to go too, I want to go too."
　　In the midst of everyone's enthusiastic discussion, Liu Taiqing spoke again, saying humorously, "Nothing beats father and son on the battlefield! I think our whole family should go to the 'front line' and form a family comfort team, with your mother staying at home." Then they divided the work. That night, Liu Taiqing, Liu Jigang, Liu Jixiang, and Liu Shuqin collectively wrote a 161-line "Change of Wedding Date." Zhu Meihua, Liu Liqin, and Liu Aiqin quickly learned the new passages. When the little girl Liu Yanqin saw that her older siblings had all been assigned tasks and she had nothing to do, she clamored and insisted on going to the front line. Her father, Old Liu, had to quickly assign her a new passage about "launching satellites" to appease her. In this combative posture, the family made various preparations overnight, and from the next day onwards, they went to the steel front line to perform comfort performances.

    家庭慰劳队
    王之道
    夜深了，青岛曲艺老艺人刘太清一家九口正围坐在一间朴素而又整洁的小屋子里。老艺人刘太清说：“今天晚上咱们开个家庭会，商量商量咱们在钢铁战线上的‘作战计划’。”
    天真活泼、性情爽朗的二姑娘刘书琴首先发言说：“我保证跑的工地多、演出多、创作多，来同你们竞赛”。
    三儿子刘济祥慢条细语地说：“我除了完成伴奏外，保证每天砸矿石三百斤”。
    刘济祥的未婚妻朱美华、大姑娘刘立琴和十二岁的四姑娘刘爱琴也要求上“前线”，虽然她们从来都没有演唱过曲艺。最令人兴奋的是六岁的小姑娘刘艳琴也唧唧咕咕地嚷着：“俺也去，俺也去”。
    在大家热烈的谈论中，刘太清又开腔了，他风趣地说：“上阵莫过父子兵！我看咱们一家人都上‘前线’，成立一个家庭慰问小组，你妈妈留在家里”。接着他们就分了工，当天夜晚刘太清、刘济广、刘济祥和刘书琴四人集体赶写了一百六十一句的“婚期之变”，朱美华、刘立琴和刘爱琴连忙学新段子。小姑娘刘艳琴一看哥哥姐姐都分配了任务，自己没有事干，便吵吵嚷嚷的不依非上前线，她爸老刘只得赶快分给她一个“放卫星”的新段子，才算完。这一家人就以这样的战斗姿态，连夜做好各种准备，从第二天起就开赴钢铁前线慰问演出了。
