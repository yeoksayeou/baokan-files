	Trees Should Achieve High Yields Quickly
	By a People's Daily Commentator

	The saying "forefathers plant the trees, later generations enjoy the shade" needs to be revised. In the past, it took more than twenty years for Chinese fir to mature into timber, but now it can mature in about ten years. Other trees have also shown typical examples of high yields. For the woody oil crop, oil tea, the national average yield of tea oil per mu last year was seven catties, but this year there are many cases of yields of three to four thousand catties per mu. In the past, the yield of mao bamboo was three to four thousand catties per mu, but this year there is a high-yield record of more than sixty thousand catties per mu. The whole country is actively working on a plan to achieve rapid high yields for two hundred million mu of forest trees, to increase timber production by one hundred to one hundred and seventy billion cubic meters in ten years or a little more, so that the timber reserves in our country will increase by one to two times; and to make tea oil production reach more than thirty-six million dan in four years. The nationwide afforestation movement not only rapidly greening barren land and mountains, but also making timber and oil resources abundant and rich in a short period of time. This is very encouraging.

	With the socialist construction advancing by leaps and bounds, the timber production, despite huge increases, still cannot meet the needs of industry, transportation, and people's lives. Increasing one ton of steel requires three more cubic meters of timber; increasing capital construction investment by ten thousand yuan requires an increase of fourteen cubic meters of timber. After the rural areas realize the people's communes, a large amount of timber is also needed. All of this requires large-scale afforestation, and rapid maturation. Therefore, only by achieving rapid high yields of trees can the problem of the supply of timber and various forest products falling short of demand be solved.

	Rapid high-yield forestry is not only a great leap forward in forestry construction, but also a revolution in forestry production. Therefore, carrying out this movement is bound to encounter some ideological obstacles. For example, some people believe that the natural conditions in their area are poor, and trees cannot grow and mature quickly; some people believe that rapid growth and high yield are only accidental phenomena, and it is impossible to universally achieve them; some people also feel that the natural conditions in their area are very good, the soil is fertile, and the rainfall is abundant, so trees can grow and mature quickly without much effort; more people believe that the current construction tasks in various fields are very tight, and there are difficulties in terms of labor and fertilizer, so they cannot take care of the rapid high-yield forestry movement. The emergence of these ideas is due to the neglect of the great power of man's subjective initiative in transforming nature. Facts have proved that as long as man's role is fully utilized, bad conditions can be turned into good ones, and good ones can be made even better. Jinping County in Guizhou Province has a population of only 90,000, and has the production tasks of 130,000 mu of farmland, 10,000 tons of iron, and 120,000 cubic meters of timber. From last winter to this spring, it afforested 1,060,000 mu, and has cultivated 500,000 mu of high-yield forest (planned to cultivate 1,000,000 mu). The heroic slogan of "changing eighteen-year fir into ten-year fir" was first proposed by Jinping. The situation in this county fully demonstrates that as long as we go all out, aim high, and all tasks can be comprehensively advanced by leaps and bounds, and difficulties cannot scare people.

	Under the situation of the great leap forward in the rural areas of the country, agricultural production has begun to shift to cultivating large areas of high-yield fields, and forestry production and greening movements are becoming increasingly important. The realization of people's communes in various places has provided more favorable conditions for carrying out the rapid high-yield forestry movement. All localities should, in accordance with the spirit of the Party Central Committee's communist education movement to be carried out in depth in the rural areas this winter and next spring, organize cadres and farmers to conduct a large-scale debate on rapid greening, rapid high-yield, and the entire forestry production, widely publicize the significance of high-yield forestry, and at the same time organize on-site visits in high-yield typical areas to promote the movement forward.

	In terms of specific measures, from the perspective of the three main tree species of Chinese fir, mao bamboo, and oil tea, there are four fundamental methods: (1) soil preparation and reclamation; (2) tending and fertilization; (3) increasing density; and (4) good seeds and strong seedlings. Carrying out the rapid high-yield forestry movement is not simply a technical issue, but also a matter of mobilizing the masses and launching a mass movement. Only by mobilizing the masses, further liberating minds, breaking superstitions, and making inventions and creations by everyone, can these measures be realized one by one, and the high-yield forestry movement can be carried out vigorously.

    林木要快速丰产
    本报评论员
    “前人栽树，后人乘凉”这句话需要修改了。过去杉木要二十多年才能成材，现在十年左右就可以成材。其他林木，也出现了丰产典型。木本油料作物油茶，去年全国平均亩产茶油七斤，今年有不少亩产三、四千斤的。毛竹过去亩产三、四千斤，今年出现亩产六万多斤的高产纪录。全国正在积极着手实现两亿亩快速丰产林木的规划，要在十年或者稍多的时间里，增产木材一百到一百七十亿立米，使我国木材蓄积量增加一倍到两倍左右；要使茶油产量在四年后达到三千六百万担以上。全民的造林运动，不但迅速绿化荒地荒山，而且使木材、油料在短时间内变得丰盈富裕，这是大为振奋人心的事情。
    随着社会主义建设一日千里地跃进，木材生产尽管有了巨大的增长，仍满足不了工业交通和人民生活的需要。增产一吨钢就要多用三立米木材；增加一万元的基建投资，就要增加十四立米木材。农村实现人民公社化以后，也需要大量木材。这一切都要求大规模造林，而且要迅速成材。因此，只有实现林木快速丰产才能够解决木材及各项林产品供不应求的问题。
    林木快速丰产，不但是林业建设的大跃进，而且是林业生产的革命。因此，开展这项运动，难免遇到一些思想障碍。比如，有的人认为本地区自然条件较差，林木不能速生成材；有的人认为速生丰产不过是偶然现象，要普遍地搞是不可能的；也有的人觉得本地区自然条件很好，土壤肥沃，雨量充沛，不用费什么劲，林木就可以速生丰产；更多的人则认为，当前各方面的建设任务都很紧张，劳力、肥料都有困难，顾不上搞林木快速丰产运动。这些思想的产生，都是由于忽视了人的主观能动作用是改造自然的伟大动力。事实证明，只要充分发挥人的作用，不好的条件可以把它变好的，好的还可以变得更好。贵州省锦屏县全县只有九万人，有十三万亩农田、一万吨铁和十二万立米木材的生产任务。去冬今春造林一百零六万亩，并且已经培育了五十万亩丰产林（计划培育一百万亩）“改十八年杉为十年杉”的豪迈口号就是锦屏首先提出的。这个县的情况充分说明，只要鼓足干劲，力争上游，各项任务是可以全面跃进的，困难是吓不住人的。
    在全国农村大跃进的形势下，农业生产已开始转向培养大面积丰产田，林业生产和绿化运动越来越显得重要。各地实现了人民公社化，给开展林木快速丰产运动提供了更为有利的条件。各地要根据党中央关于今冬明春在农村中进行深入的共产主义教育运动的精神，组织干部和农民对快速绿化快速丰产以及整个林业生产开展大辩论，广泛宣传林木丰产的意义，同时在丰产典型地区组织现场参观，把运动推向前进。
    在具体措施上，每省、每县、每个公社和一切国营林场、伐木场都要订出规划，营造丰产林，并且号召人人、队队、社社都要搞试验林。尤其是人民公社的林业部门要具体安排这项工作，加强社办林场的工作。在技术措施上，从杉木、毛竹、油茶三个主要树种来看，根本的办法有四条：（一）整土垦复；（二）抚育施肥；（三）增加密度；（四）良种壮苗。开展林木快速丰产运动，这不单纯是技术问题，也是发动群众，大搞群众运动的问题。只有发动群众，进一步解放思想破除迷信，人人发明创造，这些措施才能一一实现，林木丰产运动才能搞得有声有色。
