Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. Our correspondent reports: Soviet industrial production is in a new period of comprehensive great upsurge. An article in "Labor Daily" on October 12th pointed out that the economic competition with capitalist countries over the past forty-one years has entered the "final stage of completion."

In terms of industrial production volume, the Soviet Union had already jumped to second place in the world before World War II, second only to the United States. Judging from the results of the peaceful economic competition between the Soviet Union and the United States over the past many years, and from the prospects for future development, the Soviet Union will certainly be able to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of total industrial output and per capita output within the next ten years or so, and become the world's largest industrial power.

The Soviet Union's total industrial output and per capita output are currently about one-half and two-fifths of the United States, respectively. Before the October Revolution, Russia's total industrial output ranked fifth in the world and accounted for less than one-fourteenth of that of the United States. According to Soviet newspapers, the Soviet Union's total industrial output will reach the current level of the United States in roughly the next seven or eight years, and will catch up with the then-total industrial output of the United States in another two or three years. Since the Soviet Union's population may be 15% to 20% larger than that of the United States in nine or ten years, after catching up with and surpassing the United States in total industrial output, it will take another few years (say, about two or three years) of development to further exceed the United States by 20% in total industrial output. The Soviet Union can then catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita output. Such a time frame may well be shortened. The "People's Daily" editorial on September 6th stated that the Soviet Union "will at the latest achieve victory (in peaceful competition with capitalism) in ten to fifteen years."

The superiority of the socialist economic system and the advantage of economic development speed are reliable guarantees for the Soviet Union to surpass the United States' industrial production level in the near future. During the period of 1917-1936 and in the twenty-five years before 1955 (excluding the war years), the average annual growth rate of Soviet industrial production was 15.5% and 18.2% respectively, while the average annual increase in US industrial production during the same period was only 1% and 2.4%. In recent years, the difference in development speed between the two sides has become even greater. Compared with 1955, Soviet industrial production increased by 22% last year, and will increase by 34% this year; while US industrial production increased by only 3% last year, and is expected to decrease by about 8% to 10% this year compared with last year, falling to 95% of the 1955 level.

In recent years, the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in the absolute amount of average annual increase in the production of important industrial products such as pig iron, steel, iron ore, coal, petroleum, cement, and woolen fabrics. This is an important change in the balance of power in the competition between the two sides.

Currently, the Soviet Union has caught up with the United States in total output and per capita output of several industrial products such as combine harvesters, peat, nickel, chromium, manganese, and sugar. The output of woolen fabrics and the total volume of timber logging have also exceeded those of the United States. The total amount of coal mining is expected to catch up with and surpass the United States this year.

In recent years, the Soviet Union has taken and is taking many measures to vigorously develop the national economy. The Soviet Union implemented the reorganization of industrial and construction management work last year. This measure greatly strengthened the leadership of industrial production, enhanced local authority in economic management, and brought into play the initiative and creativity of enterprise organizations and the working masses. This year, it decided to greatly accelerate the development of the chemical industry and the realization of comprehensive automation and mechanization of production, and decided to drastically increase the production of oil and natural gas. Recently, in order to complete the task of catching up with and surpassing the United States in terms of per capita output as soon as possible, and to accelerate communist construction, the Soviet Union has particularly emphasized the issue of seizing time, and has taken a series of measures for this purpose. One of these measures is to greatly accelerate the electric power industry, especially giving priority to the development of thermal power plants. Compared with the construction of hydroelectric power plants, thermal power plants are not only cheaper to build, but more importantly, they have a shorter construction period, can be put into production faster, and can quickly promote the development of the entire economy, thereby gaining time in economic construction. In addition, the Soviet Union also pays great attention to the development of the iron and steel industry, and accelerates the construction and expansion of new iron ore bases and metallurgical bases. In terms of light industry, the Soviet Union has also decided to strive to make the production of shoes, socks, clothing, knitwear, furniture, etc. sufficient to meet the needs of residents in the next five or six years. In addition, the unprecedented development of Soviet agriculture in recent years and its further great development in the future will more powerfully promote the development of industry.

Soviet academician A. A. Arzumanyan pointed out in "Pravda" in July this year that judging from the development speed of the past few decades, the average annual growth of US industry will be about 1.6% to 2.2% in a very long period (1958-1975) in the future. That is to say, on the one hand, in the next ten years or so, Soviet industrial development will definitely leave the United States far behind.

Currently, the Soviet working people are eagerly looking forward to the convening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This congress, which will be held in early next year, will discuss the seven-year economic development plan (1959-1965). According to Soviet newspapers, the economic development speed, targets, and scale stipulated in the plan will shock the world. The realization of this plan will enable the Soviet Union to take the most decisive step in achieving the basic economic goal—overwhelming the United States in production levels. (Attached chart)

### 同资本主义国家的经济竞赛胜利在望  苏联工业生产健步如飞猛赶美国

    同资本主义国家的经济竞赛胜利在望
    苏联工业生产健步如飞猛赶美国
    新华社莫斯科3日电　本社记者报道：苏联的工业生产正处于全面大高涨的新时期。“劳动报”10月12日的一篇文章指出，四十一年来它同资本主义国家进行的经济竞赛已经进入了“最后完成的阶段”。
    在工业生产量方面，苏联早在第二次世界大战前就跃居世界第二位，仅次于美国。从苏美两国过去多年来的和平经济竞赛的结果以及今后的发展前景来看，在最近十多年内，苏联肯定可以在工业总产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上和超过美国，而成为世界上最大的工业强国。
    苏联的工业总产量和按人口平均计算的产量现在分别大约为美国的二分之一和二点五分之一。而在十月革命以前，俄国的工业总产量占世界第五位，还占不到美国的十四分之一。据苏联报纸报道，苏联的工业总产量大致在最近七、八年间就将达到目前美国的水平，再经过两三年就可以赶上当时美国的工业总产量。由于九、十年后苏联的人口可能比美国多15％到20％，因此，在工业总产量方面赶上和超过美国之后，大约再经过几年（譬如说二、三年左右）的发展，把工业总产量再超过美国20％，苏联就可以进而在按人口平均计算的产量上赶上和超过美国。这样的期限很可能还会缩短。“真理报”9月6日的社论说：苏联
  “最迟要在十到十五年内取得（同资本主义和平竞赛）的胜利”。
    社会主义经济制度的优越性和经济发展速度的优势，是苏联在不久的将来超过美国工业生产水平的可靠保证。在1917—1936年期间和1955年以前的二十五年中（战争年代除外），苏联工业生产每年平均增长速度分别为15.5％和18.2％，而同时期，美国工业生产每年平均只增加1％和2.4％。最近几年来，双方发展速度的差别更加悬殊。和1955年比较，去年苏联工业生产增加了22％，今年将增加34％；而美国的工业生产去年只增加了3％，今年预计将比去年减少大约8％到10％。降低为1955年水平的95％。
    在最近几年中，苏联已经在生铁、钢、铁矿砂、煤、石油、水泥、毛织品等重要工业品的每年平均增产的绝对数量上超过了美国。这是双方在竞赛中力量对比方面发生的一个重要的变化。
    目前，苏联已经在联合机、泥炭、镍、铬、锰、糖等几种工业品总产量和按人口计算的产量上赶上了美国。毛织品产量和木材采伐总量并已超过美国。采煤总量预计在今年就将可能赶上和超过美国。
    苏联在最近几年中已经采取和正在采取许多措施，以便大力发展国民经济。苏联在去年实行了工业和建筑业管理工作的改组，这个措施大大加强了对工业生产的领导，提高了地方在管理经济方面的权力，发挥了企业组织和劳动群众的主动性和创造性。今年，它又决定大大加速发展化学工业和实现生产的全面自动化和机械化，并且决定急剧提高石油和天然瓦斯的生产。最近以来，为了尽快地完成在按人口平均产量方面赶上和超过美国的任务，加速共产主义建设，苏联特别强调争取时间的问题，并为此采取了一系列的措施。其中一项措施就是大大加速电力工业，特别是优先发展火力发电站。同水力发电站的建设相比，火力发电站不仅建筑费用较低，而尤其重要的是建筑期限较短，可以较快地投入生产，迅速推动整个经济的发展，从而在经济建设中赢得时间。此外，苏联还十分注意发展钢铁工业，加速铁矿基地和冶金基地的新建和扩建工程。在轻工业方面，苏联也决定争取在最近五、六年间使鞋袜、服装、针织品、家具等的生产能够充分满足居民的需要。此外，苏联农业最近几年的空前发展和今后的进一步大发展，将更有力地促进工业的发展。
    苏联阿朱马尼安院士今年7月间在“真理报”上指出，从已往几十年发展速度判断，在今后一个很长的时期（1958—1975年），美国工业每年平均增长大约是1.6％到2.2％。这就是说，一方面，在未来的十多年中，苏联工业发展肯定将把美国远远地抛在后面。
    目前，苏联劳动人民正以急切的心情期待着苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的召开。这个将要在明年年初举行的代表大会，将要讨论七年经济发展计划（1959—1965年）。据苏联报纸透露，计划中规定的经济发展速度、指标和规模将使全世界为之震惊。实现这个计划，将使苏联在达到基本经济目标——在生产水平上压倒美国——方面迈出最有决定意义的一步。（附图表）
