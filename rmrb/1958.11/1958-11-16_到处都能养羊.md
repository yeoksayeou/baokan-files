    Sheep Can Be Raised Everywhere
    With the continuous improvement of people's living standards, woolen fabrics such as sweaters and yarn, and sheepskin products used in some clothing, are no longer enjoyed by only a few people; with the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the demand for mutton and sheep's milk is also increasing. How can we meet the people's needs in this regard? Only by raising sheep, raising more sheep.
    In the past few years, although China's sheep raising work has made great progress, it is mostly concentrated in a few pastoral areas, while the vast agricultural areas do not raise many. Taking the ten southern provinces as an example, the number of sheep raised is less than one-tenth of the country's total, with an average of only one sheep for every twenty people. Why is this? Originally, some people were still superstitious about this work. For example, some people believe that there is no grass source in the southern agricultural areas, so sheep cannot be raised in large numbers; others believe that the temperature is high and humid in the south, and sheep cannot grow well; some also believe that raising sheep conflicts with soil and water conservation.
    Is this actually the case? No. Although there are no large grasslands in the southern agricultural areas like in pastoral areas, there are a large number of barren mountains and slopes, where large patches of grass also grow. In addition, the agricultural areas produce a large number of grain by-products, which can also be used as feed for sheep. Chongde, Haining, and Wuxing counties in Zhejiang Province, relied on these conditions to develop 630,000 sheep, an average of more than two per household. The temperature is high and humid in the south, but it does not hinder the normal growth of sheep. In addition to the aforementioned three counties of Chongde, etc., which have already raised a large number of sheep, Jinggang Mountain in Jiangxi Province also successfully trial-raised Xinjiang sheep this year, and the Huzhou sheep trial-raised in the Zhoushan Islands are fatter than in other regions. These facts show that the south can not only raise ordinary sheep, but also has the conditions to raise fine wool sheep. Raising a large number of sheep will not damage soil and water conservation. Experience has shown that with proper grazing management, soil and water conservation not only does not conflict with raising sheep, but also creates favorable conditions for raising sheep. Many areas in the north that have done a good job in soil and water conservation have seen rapid development of sheep. Yangjingdi in Shanxi Province is an example. They adopted the method of rotational closure and grazing, which not only did a good job in soil and water conservation, but also developed the flock.
    Agricultural areas can not only raise sheep, but should raise sheep. Raising sheep can greatly increase income. Wool and sheepskin are of high economic value and can be exported and exchanged; mutton and sheep's milk are necessities for urban and rural people, which can not only improve the lives of local people, but also be sold as commodities; sheep manure is a good fertilizer for agriculture and is the capital for increasing agricultural production.
    After the implementation of the basic farmland system, the conditions for raising sheep in agricultural areas are even better. Farmland that is returned to forests or planted with pasture due to the adoption of the basic farmland system is a beautiful future grazing land. People's communes that do not raise sheep or raise few sheep should quickly raise sheep, and raise more sheep. (Picture attached)

### 到处都能养羊

    到处都能养羊
    随着人民生活水平不断的提高，毛衣、毛线等毛织品和一些服装着用的羊皮制品，已不是少数人享用的东西了；随着人民生活水平不断的提高，对羊肉、羊乳的需要量也越来越多了。怎样来满足人民这方面的需要呢？只有养羊，多多养羊。
    几年来，我国养羊工作虽然有很大的发展，但大多集中在少数牧区，而广大的农业区则饲养不多。以南方十个省来说，养羊头数还不及全国羊只的十分之一，平均每二十个人才有一只羊。这是为什么呢？原来有人对这一工作还有迷信。例如有人认为南方农业区没有草源，就不能大量养羊；又有人认为南方气温高，潮湿，羊只不能很好生长；也有人认为养羊和水土保持有矛盾。
    实际是不是这样呢？不是。在南方农业区虽然不像牧区有大片草原，但有大量荒山和荒坡，在这些荒山荒坡上，同样长有大片青草。再有农业区生产谷物的大量副产物，也可以充做羊的饲料。浙江崇德、海宁、吴兴三县，就是依靠这些条件发展了羊六十三万只，平均每户二只多。南方是气温高，潮湿，但并不妨碍羊的正常生长。除了前边所说的崇德等三县已大量养羊以外，江西井冈山今年也试养新疆羊成功，舟山群岛试养的湖羊，比其他地区肥壮。这些事实说明了南方不仅可以养一般羊，而且还具备养细毛羊的条件。大量养羊也不会破坏水土保持。经验证明：牧放管理得法，水土保持不但不同养羊有矛盾，而且为养羊创造了有利条件。北方有许多水土保持工作做得好的地区，羊的发展很快。山西羊井底就是一个例子。他们采用了轮封轮放的办法，既搞好了水土保持，又发展了羊群。
    农业区不但可以养羊，而且应该养羊。养了羊，可以大大增加收入。羊毛、羊皮经济价值很高，还可以出口，可以交换；羊肉、羊乳是城乡人民的生活必需品，既可以改善当地人民的生活，又便于作为商品出售；羊粪是农业的好肥料，是农业增产的本钱。
    在实行基本农田制以后，农业区的养羊条件就更好了，由于采用基本农田制而退耕还林或种植牧草的农田，都是未来的美好的牧放地。没有养羊或养羊少的人民公社，应该赶快养羊，多多养羊。（附图片）
