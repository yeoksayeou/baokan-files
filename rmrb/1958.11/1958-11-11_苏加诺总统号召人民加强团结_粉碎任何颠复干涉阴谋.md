Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 10th - According to a report by Antara News Agency, Indonesian President Sukarno, speaking at a mass meeting in Sabarua, southern Seram Island, Maluku, on the 8th, said that Indonesia will continue to strengthen its political, economic, and military strength. He said: With these forces, we will crush any conspiracy of division, subversion, and interference.

President Sukarno arrived in Sabarua while inspecting Maluku Island, accompanied by the Chinese, Soviet, and American ambassadors to Indonesia.

In his speech, President Sukarno called on the people to strengthen unity. He pointed out that as long as they are united, even ten imperialisms can be wiped out by the Indonesian people, not to mention a "revolutionary government"—the "Charter of Overall Struggle" rebel group.

Referring to the issue of eliminating the rebels, he reiterated that he himself, the three armed forces, and the heads of government hold a common attitude on this issue.

President Sukarno continued that no force can prevent the Indonesian people from recovering West Irian. He said that West Irian will one day return to the hands of the Indonesian people.

Before visiting Sabarua, President Sukarno visited Amahai, another city in southern Seram Island, on the 7th. He said to the welcoming masses there: The "revolutionary government"—"Charter of Overall Struggle" rebel group has failed despite foreign assistance, including the provision of weapons, because their activities are unpatriotic.

President Sukarno called on the people to work hard on construction. He said that China and the Soviet Union can be taken as examples in this regard.

President Sukarno also attended a reception held by Soviet Ambassador Volkov on the 7th to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution.
