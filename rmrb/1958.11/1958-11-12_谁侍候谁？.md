    Who Serves Whom?
    The "July 13th" Commune in Qinghai launched a movement to respect the "four personnel," eliminating the old notion that cooks, nursery workers, and midwives were people who "serve others," and establishing a new attitude towards labor. Is "serving others" good or bad after all?
    In the old society, "serving others" was unreasonable; it was the ruling class's exploitation of the oppressed, and we resolutely opposed this phenomenon. So, should people serve others today? Yes, that's definitely the case. Isn't that the reality? Taking care of children is serving others, cooking is serving others, sewing and processing are serving others, driving is serving others. In short, all work that serves people can be said to be serving others. However, this is a division of labor in society, it is serving the people, therefore, this kind of labor is equally glorious, indispensable, and should be respected by society today.
    Comrade Shaoqi once said during an inspection in Anhui: In our society, everyone serves each other, and serving others is also serving oneself, which is the so-called "one for all, all for one." (As reported in the August 26th Anhui Daily). Therefore, we must be brave to do the work of serving others, and do the work of serving others wholeheartedly. This is a glorious thing.

    谁侍候谁？
    青海“七一三”公社开展尊重“四员”运动，消除了炊事员、保育员、接生员是“侍候人”的人的旧观念，树立了新的劳动态度。“侍候人”究竟好不好呢？
    在旧社会，“侍候人”是不合理的，那是统治阶级对被压迫者的剥削，我们坚决反对这种现象。那么，在今天人是不是也要侍候呢？要，这是肯定无疑的。事实不正是这样吗？带孩子是侍候人，做饭是侍候人，缝纫加工是侍候人，开车是侍候人，总之，一切为人服务的工作都可以说是侍候人。不过这是社会的分工，是为人民服务，因此，这种劳动在今天同样是光荣的，是不可少的，是应该受到社会尊重的。
    少奇同志在安徽视察时曾经说过：在我们的社会里，大家都是互相侍候的，侍候别人也就是侍候自己，即所谓“人人为我，我为人人。”（载8月26日安徽日报）因此，我们要勇于做侍候人的工作，要全心全意地做好侍候人的工作，这是光荣的事。
