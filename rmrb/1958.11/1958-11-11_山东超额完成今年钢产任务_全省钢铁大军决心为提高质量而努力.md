Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th: Shandong Province's more than four million-strong steel army, after days and nights of arduous struggle, had produced 226,519.9 tons of steel for the country by the 7th, exceeding the annual state plan ahead of schedule. On the 7th, all steelmaking fronts, while celebrating the 41st anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, launched a high-yield satellite of 24,667.9 tons of steel per day.

This year, Shandong Province's steel production rapidly caught up, leaping higher and higher in the later stages. In the first half of the year, the province produced a total of 13,564 tons of steel. However, after the Party Central Committee put forward the great call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, a massive steelmaking upsurge emerged throughout the province. Party committees at all levels resolutely implemented the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" and "small-scale indigenous groups," ensuring full mobilization and reliance on the masses, with secretaries taking the lead and cadres setting an example, thus enabling steel production to leap from one peak to another. After receiving steelmaking instructions during the second satellite week, the Laiyang Prefecture vigorously engaged in indigenous methods, building more than 49,000 indigenous steelmaking furnaces in less than four days.

Currently, the entire province's steel army is determined to continue their efforts and is determined to produce more steel and better iron for the country within this year.

    山东超额完成今年钢产任务
    全省钢铁大军决心为提高质量而努力
    据新华社济南10日电　山东省四百多万钢铁大军经过日日夜夜的苦战，到7日止已经为国家生产出二十二万六千五百一十九点九吨钢，提前超额完成全年国家计划。7日这一天，各炼钢阵地在欢庆伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年的同时，放出日产钢二万四千六百六十七点九吨的大卫星。
    今年，山东省钢的产量是在后期一跃再跃，迅速追上的。上半年全省一共生产钢一万三千五百六十四吨，但是在党中央提出今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的伟大号召以后，全省便出现了一个声势浩大的炼钢高潮。各级党委坚决贯彻了“土洋并举”和“小土群”方针，做到了充分发动群众、依靠群众，书记挂帅、干部带头，因而使钢铁生产从一个高峰跃上另一个高峰。莱阳专区在第二次卫星周中，接到炼钢指示以后，就大搞土法，不到四天，就建起土法炼钢炉四万九千多座。
    目前，全省钢铁大军保证再接再厉，决心在今年内再为国家生产更多的钢和更多的好铁。
