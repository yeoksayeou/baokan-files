    True Gold in the Crucible

    Ode to Life
    Heroic artilleryman Hu De'an, covered in burns, has overcome death in the hospital with his vigorous vitality and is gradually recovering his health.

    The black scabs from the burns all over his body have fallen off, and a humorous smile has returned to his ruddy face. He sleeps on time, and during the day, with the help of nurses, he endures the pain and tenaciously trains the joints of his legs, arms, and wrists to quickly restore their function.

    Whenever the dressing is changed or after a meal, he lies prone on the bed, quietly listening to the nurses read the newspaper. The new achievements of the motherland's industrial and agricultural construction, and the victorious news from the front lines, have become his spiritual strength in his struggle for health.

    Sometimes, he turns his face to look at the autumn scenery outside the window, and then earnestly asks the doctor: "When can I return to my company?" The doctor comforts him: "Your injuries will heal quickly. Exercise your joints well, so they obey your commands as before."

    These words gave Hu De'an great encouragement. As soon as he said it, he did it, gritting his teeth and shouting the command "One, two, three," he began to practice. Although the pain made his eyes see stars and sweat poured from his head, he happily sang "The East is Red" as long as the exercise yielded slight progress.

    Hu De'an's tenacious will and passionate emotions moved the hearts of the doctors and nurses. They often sang and laughed with Hu De'an. This is a praise of life. Who snatched such a person with 66% burns from the clutches of death? It is the Party, the Party that gave people the ideological power of Communism.
    The Giant Hand That Parts the Clouds to See the Sun

    At noon on September 12th, a military ambulance carrying three artillerymen who were burned in battle arrived at the hospital. The patients' faces were severely swollen, their blackened skin emitting a strong smell of burning.

    Among the three patients, one was the most seriously injured, with multiple ruptures in the skin and flesh of his arms and hands, exposing veins and nerves. However, he did not utter a sound, enduring it all. He was the heroic artilleryman Hu De'an, who, in the raging flames, shouted: "Preserve the cannon, preserve the lives of my comrades, let the shells go to bomb the enemy!" and insisted on firing a shell about to explode in the chamber.

    Faced with such a large area of burn patients, the doctors and nurses felt heavy and complicated.

    Not long ago, the hospital had received many burned children, who died despite rescue efforts. Although in our country, filled with miracles, there had been the precedent of steelworker Qiu Cai Kang, who survived 89.3% burns, the so-called "authoritative conclusion" that burns exceeding 50% had little hope of healing still played a role in some people's minds. They justified themselves by saying: "Others are others, we are we, the conditions are different!"

    Speaking of conditions, the doctors here had little experience in treating war wounds, especially large-area burns; most people had never even seen them. However, it was not those conditions that determined the success or failure of the treatment, but rather how to break the spiritual shackles of slavery in people's minds.

    The hospital Party committee held an emergency meeting that night. The Party committee's battle cry was: Rescuing the wounded is the medical staff's response in action to the military provocations of US imperialism. All hospital staff must break superstitions, emancipate their minds, and hold high the ever-victorious red flag of Communism to do what others cannot do.

    After the meeting, the hospital Party committee organized all staff to visit the patients in the ward, using the patients as textbooks, teaching doctors and nurses how to hate the enemy and how to love the wounded class brothers.

    People who had seen Hu De'an's injuries wrote big-character posters with tears in their eyes.

    "Burning on the wounded, pain in my heart, I will try every means to relieve the wounded's pain."

    "In order to save class brothers, we will give blood if needed, skin if needed, and people if needed."

    "Saving patients" became the top priority for all hospital staff. The internal medicine and ophthalmology departments sent nurses to support surgery. Young military doctor Guo Fuhua designed a sketch of a skin grafting machine overnight and sent it to the machine factory for manufacturing; hydropower worker Shen Xiqin, hearing that the patient had difficulty turning over, made a turning bed overnight.
    Battle Joined Against Death
    That night, doctors studied the condition all night, and nurses on duty stayed in the ward, never leaving the patient's side. The patient had been running a high fever and sweating profusely, with a particularly large amount of exudate from the wound. Because the patient had lost too much blood, a large amount of fluid needed to be replenished.

    However, Hu De'an's arm wound was too large, and no vein could be found. Every second of delay would endanger the patient's life. In everyone's anxiety, someone remembered that the patient's foot injury was lighter, and intravenous injection was immediately performed on the foot. The needle was too thin, the flow rate was slow, and the needle was blocked several times due to plasma coagulation. Shen Huaishan, a member of the hospital Party committee and director of the department, decided after much deliberation to replace the needle with a medium-sized plastic tube used by women to braid their hair. Thus, 10,000 milliliters of blood and water were injected drop by drop into the patient's body through the plastic tube that was related to his life.

    But the patient's condition was still unstable. His breathing would become rapid, and his pulse would weaken. This ominous symptom tightened the heartstrings of the doctors and nurses. Attending physician Zong Ruihua worked continuously for seventy-two hours. The hospital leaders advised him to rest, but he said he was not tired. The head nurse asked him to eat, but he said he was not hungry. But he fell asleep while writing a prescription in the office, and suddenly heard the patient calling in pain in his dream. He woke up and ran to the ward, but the patient was sleeping peacefully. This attending physician, who grew up in the revolutionary ranks, said when talking about his feelings: "The soldiers on the front lines are not afraid of sacrifice and bloodshed. What is it to stay up three or five nights to save the lives of class brothers?"

    In our country, no one is alone. As long as you need it, helping hands will reach out from all directions. Late at night, the patient urgently needed an isotonic solution of 5% glucose. The director of the pharmacy, Ji Zhenglin, ran to the city pharmaceutical company overnight to buy the medicine. The company's salesperson had already left work, and only one worker was guarding the house. When he heard that a burned patient had come from the front line and urgently needed glucose, the old worker led Ji Zhenglin to the storage room to get the medicine. When it came time to pay, Ji Zhenglin didn't have enough money, and the old worker waved his hand and said, "Take the medicine back first, and settle the account tomorrow, don't delay the important thing."

    The third surgical department requested the blood bank to provide 4,000 milliliters of whole blood, and the blood bank doctor immediately notified the members of the blood transfusion team. The people who came to donate blood included workers and working cadres. They had visited artilleryman Hu De'an's injuries in the ward and were all filled with righteous indignation. Then, they rolled up their sleeves. But they refused to accept blood transfusion fees and refused to eat pig liver soup. They said: "The soldiers are using guns to fight the enemy on the front lines to defend socialist construction, and my blood donation is a practical action to strike at US imperialism. Give the pig liver to the wounded, let them nourish their bodies to fight the enemy."
    Heroic Radiance Illuminates Loyal Hearts

    Even in life-threatening and extremely painful circumstances, Hu De'an never forgot his comrades and cannons. He had only one simple hope - when can he return to the company.

    When changing the dressing, Hu De'an was in so much pain that he was covered in sweat and his limbs trembled, but he never shed a tear. Only twice did he cry very painfully. Once, the leaders of the troops came to visit the patient and told Hu De'an that the cannon he used was broken. Hu De'an cried very sadly. The other time, when Dr. Wei Yaomei changed Hu De'an's dressing, when Hu De'an saw the deep burns on his hands, he shed tears and said to the doctor: "Can my hands get better?" "Yes, it won't be long before they will." Hu De'an smiled immediately after hearing the doctor's answer and said excitedly: "Great! When I return to the company, I will use them to fight!"

    Dr. Wei Yaomei is a graduate of the Military Medical University. When she first saw Hu De'an's injury, she could not control her emotions and shed tears. Recalling this incident, she said: "The hero's strong will and optimistic spirit gave me a great education. I have no reason not to do my work carefully and attentively." Taking the patient's pain as her own, and the patient's happiness as her own. She felt heavy when the patient's wound became infected and his temperature rose; she felt like singing when the patient was in good spirits and his appetite increased.

    This change in class feelings is deeply felt by everyone who participated in the rescue struggle. Head nurse Xu Jingxue stayed with the patient for twenty-four hours when Hu De'an was in a state of mania and coma. She said: "In the past, I often considered whether to be a head nurse for the rest of my life. This time, I learned the noble communist virtue of selflessness from Hu De'an and corrected my incorrect views on the future. I am willing to be a head nurse for the rest of my life. Military doctors and nurses are a revolutionary division of labor, and there is nothing high or low."

    The hard work of doctors and nurses has won the trust and love of patients. One day, when Hu De'an and his comrade Chen Jiaming discussed how to repay the life-saving grace of doctors and nurses, he firmly said: "Go back to the company and constantly transmit the news of victory to the people of the whole country!"

    生命的赞歌
    遍体烧伤的英雄炮手胡德安，在医院里以他旺盛的生命力，战胜了死神，渐渐恢复着健康。
    他身上烧伤的黑皮痂已经脱净，红润的脸上又挂上了诙谐的笑容。他按时睡眠，白天在护士帮助下，忍着疼痛，顽强地训练着腿、胳膊、手腕的关节，促使它迅速恢复机能。
    每当换过药，或是吃过饭的时候，他俯卧在床上，静静地听着护士读报。祖国工农业建设的新成就，前线的胜利消息，成了他为健康而斗争的精神力量。
    有的时候，他侧过脸去，望望窗外的秋景，然后恳切地问医生：“我哪一天才能回到连里去？”医生安慰他：“你的伤很快就会好的。好好锻炼关节吧，叫它和以往一样听你使唤。”
    这话给了胡德安很大鼓励。说干就干，他咬着牙关，喊着“一二三”的口令，开始了操练。尽管疼得眼睛冒金花，头上冒热汗，只要操练稍有收获，他就高兴地唱起“东方红”。
    胡德安这种顽强坚韧的意志、充沛热烈的情感，激动着医生、护士们的心。他们常常和胡德安一起唱起来，笑起来。这是对生命的赞颂呵。是谁把这样一个受了66％烧伤的人，从死亡的魔爪下夺了回来呢？那就是党，是党给了人们以共产主义的思想力量。
        拨云见日的巨手
    9月12日中午，一辆军用救护车，载着三个战斗中负了烧伤的炮手，来到这个医院里。病人的脸肿得很厉害，发黑的皮肤，散发着浓烈的焦腥味。
    三个病人中，有一个伤势最重，双臂、双手的皮肉多处破裂，露出一根根血管和神经。但是，他一声不哼，忍受着。他就是在熊熊的火焰中，喊着：“保全大炮，保全战友们的生命，让炮弹去炸敌人！”坚持把炮膛里的一颗即将爆炸的炮弹，打了出去的英雄炮手胡德安。
    在这样大面积的烧伤病人面前，医生、护士的心情是沉重的，复杂的。
    不久以前，这个医院接受过不少受了烧伤的孩子，营救无效，死去了。虽然在我们这个充满了奇迹的国家里，曾有过钢铁工人丘财康烧伤89.3％而获救的先例，然而烧伤到50％便很少医好希望的所谓“权威定论”，在有些人们的脑子里还起着作用。他们这样给自己辩解着：“人家是人家，我们是我们，条件不同呀！”
    讲起条件，这里的医生治过战伤的很少，尤其是大面积的烧伤，绝大多数人见都没见过。然而决定治疗成败的不是那些条件，重要的倒是怎样打碎人们头脑里的那条奴隶的精神锁链。
    院党委当夜召开了紧急会议。党委的战斗口号是：救活伤员是医务人员用行动对美帝国主义军事挑衅的回击。全院工作人员要破除迷信，解放思想，高举共产主义无往不胜的红旗，去做别人做不到的事。
    会后，院党委组织全院人员到病房去探视病人，用病人作课本，教会医生、护士知道怎样去恨敌人，怎样去爱受了伤的阶级兄弟。
    看过胡德安伤情的人们，流着眼泪写大字报。
    “烧在伤员的身上，痛在我的心里，我要想尽一切办法，去解除伤员的痛苦。”
    “为了救活阶级兄弟，要血有血，要皮有皮，要人有人。”
    “救活病人”，成了全院工作人员的头等大事。内科、五官科都派出了护士去支援外科。青年军医郭福华，连夜设计出了植皮机的草图，送到机器厂去制造；水电工人沈锡勤听说病人翻身困难，一夜之间做好了翻身床。
      向死神展开了交手仗
    这一夜，医生通夜研究病情，值班护士寸步不离病房。病人一直发着高烧，全身大汗如雨，创面渗液特别多。由于病人失血过多，需要补充大量液体。
    但是胡德安的臂部创面太大，找不到静脉管。一分一秒的耽搁都会造成病人生命的危险。在大家万分焦急的时候，有人记起病人脚背伤势较轻，立刻在脚背上进行静脉注射。针头太细，流速慢，针头几次因血浆凝结而阻塞。院党委委员、科主任沈怀山同志，苦思之后，决定用女同志扎辫子用的中号塑胶管代替针头，于是一万毫升的血和水，通过生命所系的塑胶管，一滴一滴注入病人的体内。
    但是病人的情况还是不稳定的。他一会呼吸急促起来，一会脉搏微弱下去。这种不祥的征状，拉紧了医生、护理人员的心弦。主治医生纵瑞华，连续值班七十二小时。院首长劝他休息，他说不累，护士长叫他去吃饭，他说不饿。但是他在办公室里开着处方就睡着了，梦中忽然听到病人喊疼，他醒过来，跑到病房，病人却安静地睡着。这个在革命队伍里土生土长起来的主治医生，谈起自己的心情时说：“前方战士，牺牲流血都不怕，为挽救阶级兄弟的生命，熬个三天五夜算什么。”
    在我们的国家里，任何人都不是孤单的，只要你需要，就会从四面八方伸来援助的手。深夜，急需给病人输5％的葡萄糖等渗溶液。药库主任吉正林连夜跑到市医药公司去买药。公司售货员早下了班，只有一个工人看家。一说从前方来了烧伤病人，急需用葡萄糖，老工人就把吉正林领到储室里去取药。付款的时候，吉正林带的钱不够，老工人摆摆手说：“先拿药回去，明天再来算账，别耽误了大事”。
    外三科要求血库供给四千毫升的全血，血库医生马上通知了输血团的团员。前来输血的有工人，也有工作干部。他们到病房探视过炮手胡德安的伤势，个个义愤填胸。然后，卷起了自己的袖管。但是他们却拒绝收输血费，拒绝吃猪肝汤。他们说：“战士们在前方为保卫社会主义建设用枪炮打击敌人，我献血就是打击美帝国主义的实际行动。把猪肝给伤员吃吧，让他们养好身体去打敌人。”
        英雄光辉照丹心
    胡德安即使在生命垂危、万分痛苦的情况下，他念念不忘的还是自己的战友和大炮。他只有一个单纯的希望——什么时候才能回到连队去。
    换药的时候，胡德安疼得满头大汗，四肢颤抖，不曾掉过一滴眼泪。只有两次他哭得很痛。一次，部队的首长来探望病人，告诉胡德安他使用过的那门炮坏了。胡德安哭得十分悲伤。另一次，魏尧梅医生给胡德安换药，当胡德安看到手上的烧伤很深时，他流下泪来，向医生说：“我的手能好吗？”“能，不要多久就会好的。”胡德安听了医生的回答立刻破涕而笑，兴奋地说：“太好拉！回到连里，我还要用它打仗呢！”
    魏尧梅医生是军医大学毕业的学生，她初次看到胡德安的伤曾控制不住自己的感情，落了泪。回想到这件事，她说：“英雄的坚强意志和乐观精神，给我很大教育。我没有理由不精心专意地把工作做好。”以病人的痛苦为痛苦，以病人的快乐为快乐。病人伤口化脓，体温升高，她心情沉重；病人精神畅快，食量增加，她高兴得想唱。
    这种阶级感情的变化，凡是参加了抢救斗争的人，感受都是深刻的。护士长许静学，在胡德安处于狂燥不安和昏迷状态的情况下，二十四小时守着病人。她说：“过去自己还时常考虑：是不是干一辈子护士长。这次从胡德安身上，学到了舍己为人的共产主义的高贵品德，纠正了自己对前途的不正确看法。我愿意干一辈子护士长。军医、护士是革命的分工，没有什么高低贵贱。”
    医生、护士的辛勤劳动，博得病人的信任和爱戴。有一天，胡德安和同班战友陈家明讨论，怎样报答医生、护士救命之恩的时候，他坚决地说：“回连队去，不断把胜利消息传给全国人民！”（附图片）
