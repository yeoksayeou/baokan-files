    Caring About Collective Life is a Major Current Event
    Pingjiang Launches Debate to Improve Canteen and Nursery Work, Commune Members Bursting with Enthusiasm

    (Our Dispatch) Hunan's Pingjiang County’s Party organizations are reversing the phenomenon of some cadres not caring about the collective life of commune members and are earnestly strengthening leadership over collective life. Currently, in the county's fourteen people's communes, each commune has a Party Committee Secretary responsible for organizing commune members' lives, and more than 1,500 Communist Party members and 3,100 Communist Youth League members have been assigned to specifically improve the work of public canteens, nurseries, and other areas. Commune members are eating their fill, are warmly dressed, and have good housing, while also saving money. Everyone is in high spirits, and each person's enthusiasm is soaring, with production surges one after another.

    By the end of September, the county, based on the people's communes, had established 4,544 public canteens, 982 kindergartens, 3,554 nurseries, 498 sewing groups, and more than 4,500 laundry groups, achieving militarized organization, combat-ready action, and collectivized life throughout the county. In early October, Wang Xiaoliang, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, and other members of the County Party Committee, went to public canteens, kindergartens, and other living areas to inspect collective welfare undertakings. They found that most communes were organizing collective life in an orderly manner, and production was going well; however, some communes were not managing collective life well. The key problem was that some cadres regarded managing collective life as a trivial matter and did not care about the lives of commune members. The County Party Committee analyzed the following erroneous views held by some cadres at the time: some people thought that production was busy, with harvesting and planting to be done, so there was no time to manage these "minor life matters"; others believed that the communes had implemented a grain supply system, so there was no need to worry about commune members' food and clothing; still others emphasized that life matters were difficult to handle, as "it is difficult to please everyone," and even if one tried to manage them, it would not work out well. Based on the above-mentioned erroneous understandings of the cadres, the County Party Committee held three consecutive telephone conferences, conducted criticisms, and emphasized that organizing the collective life of the communes was a major event with significant economic and political implications. It not only directly affects the current state of production and the consolidation of the people's communes, but also demonstrates the superiority of collective life to the peasants and cultivates and strengthens the peasants' collectivist ideology. In order to unify cadres' thinking, a major debate was launched among cadres throughout the county. The focus of the debate was: Is the issue of collective life a minor matter or a major matter? After the implementation of the grain supply system, should people's lives still be cared for? Can collective life be managed well?

    When the Fourth Production Team of the Qu Yuan People's Commune began the debate, nine of the thirty-one team cadres believed that life matters were trivial, that it did not matter whether they were grasped or not, and that there was no need for discussion. At the meeting, everyone presented the facts from the team to refute the theory that "minor life matters are irrelevant." Of the team's twenty-eight public canteens, twelve did not have capable cadres and were not run well, causing work delays every day due to late meals. The tenth company, with eighty-seven households and one hundred eighty-three laborers, was divided into four public canteens for meals. The first canteen was run well, with early and complete attendance at work. On October 13th, forty-five laborers harvested more than 6,300 jin of late rice grain in one morning. The other three public canteens had untimely meals, and one hundred thirty-eight laborers did not go to work in the morning, resulting in a loss of nearly 20,000 jin of grain that day. This was a stark contrast. The meeting also calculated that the team had one hundred eighty-seven women burdened by children, and if the nurseries were not run well, the women would not be able to concentrate on production, resulting in a loss of more than 8,900 work points in six days. A lamp will not shine if you do not turn up the wick, and things will not become clear if you do not debate them. After the cadres' thinking was unified, the team assigned twenty-nine Party members and eleven Youth League members to strengthen the work of collective welfare departments and adjusted ten well-lit and well-ventilated houses to serve as nurseries. The women were all actively going to work. The number of workers in the team increased from more than 1,200 to more than 2,000.

    Regarding the question of whether collective life can be managed well, experience from various parts of Pingjiang has proven that as long as the Party Committee attaches importance to it, strengthens leadership, and fully mobilizes the masses, it is entirely possible to manage collective life well. For example, the First Public Canteen of the Zhifu Brigade of the Changshou People's Commune was originally not run well, and the masses reflected, "It's not as good as each doing their own thing!" After the commune sent Communist Party member Yu Mingxing and others to work in the canteen, they first convened a meeting of one hundred sixty-two activists, launched a great airing of views, a great debate, and discussed how to improve meals. The masses posted 263 big-character posters, putting forward many rational suggestions. The canteen staff regularly announced accounts based on the opinions of commune members and also formulated "Five Good" pledges. The canteen raised 250 pigs, 325 chickens and ducks, and planted 35 mu of vegetables. It also established men's and women's bathhouses. Every meal has at least two dishes and a soup, and it is also cheap. Commune members happily said, "The public canteen is really good. Now, we can just concentrate on production with peace of mind."

    Currently, the public canteens in each commune throughout the county have elected their own food management committees, and the work has been brought onto the right track. The canteens throughout the county plant more than 10,000 mu of vegetables, raise 68,200 pigs, more than 410,000 chickens and ducks, and more than 480,000 fish.

    Experience from various parts of Pingjiang has proven that having the secretary take the lead, carrying out comparison and competition movements among service personnel, pulling out white flags, and inserting red flags is a good way to promote the current collective welfare undertakings. Dai Kaifa, the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Meixian People's Commune, went to the Tuanshan Brigade, personally went into the kitchen, and worked with the masses to run the meals well, and was called a "Ten Good" public canteen by the masses. One hundred sixty-one cooks from the entire commune held a field meeting here, boosting everyone's confidence in improving meals. Then, among the service personnel throughout the commune, a "Five Good" comparison and competition was carried out, including good service attitude, good cleanliness and hygiene, cheap food with good dishes, diverse and tasty vegetables, and timely tea and water supply. As a result, eleven "Five Good" units were selected and red flags were raised; many cooks were named models.

    Through organizing collective life, Pingjiang County has increased the attendance rate throughout the county from about 50% of the total population to 74%. By October 23rd, 300,000 mu of late rice, 100,000 mu of sweet potatoes, and crops such as beans, peanuts, and cotton throughout the county had been harvested in a timely manner, and other autumn planting and deep plowing work had also been carried out well.

    关心集体生活是当前大事
    平江展开辩论改进食堂托儿所工作社员个个干劲冲天
    本报讯　湖南平江县各级党组织扭转部分干部不关心公社社员集体生活的现象，认真加强对集体生活的领导。现在，全县十四个人民公社，社社有一位党委书记负责组织社员生活，还抽出一千五百多名共产党员、三千一百多名共青团员，专门负责搞好公共食堂、托儿所等工作。社员们吃得饱，穿得暖，住得好，又省钱，人人精神愉快，个个干劲冲天，生产高潮一个赛过一个。
    9月底，全县以人民公社为单位，办起四千五百四十四个公共食堂、九百八十二个幼儿园、三千五百五十四个托儿所、四百九十八个缝纫组和四千五百多个洗衣组，全县实现了组织军事化、行动战斗化和生活集体化。10月上旬，县委第一书记王效良和其他县委委员，到公共食堂、幼儿园等生活场所，检查集体福利事业。发现大多数公社集体生活组织得井井有条，生产搞得很好；但也有部分公社集体生活管理得不好。关键问题是部分干部把管理集体生活看成是件婆婆妈妈的小事情，不关心社员生活。县委分析当时干部中有这样几种错误看法：一种人认为生产忙，收的要收，种的要种，那有时间去管这些“生活小事”；另一种人则认为公社实行了粮食供给制，吃饭不要钱，社员不愁吃、穿，用不着去管；还有一种人强调生活事难办，“一人难合千人意”，要管也管不好。县委根据上述干部中的错误认识，连续召开了三次电话会议，进行了批判，强调指出组织好公社的集体生活，是一件有重大经济意义政治意义的大事情。它不仅直接关系到当前生产好坏和人民公社的巩固，而且关系到向农民显示集体生活的优越性，关系到培养和锻炼农民集体主义思想。为了统一干部思想认识，在全县干部中开展了一场大辩论。辩论的焦点是：集体生活问题是小事还是大事？实行粮食供给制后，群众生活还要不要关心？集体生活能不能管理好？
    屈原人民公社第四生产队开始辩论时，三十一个队干部有九个认为生活小事，抓不抓无关紧要，用不着讨论。会上，大家摆出队里事实驳倒了“生活小事无关紧要”论。全队二十八个公共食堂有十二个没有得力干部，办得不好，每天因为开饭不及时误了工。第十连八十七户一百八十三个劳力分成四个公共食堂吃饭。第一食堂办得好，出工早、出工齐，四十五个劳力在10月13日那天，一个早上就扮晚稻谷六千三百多斤；其他三个公共食堂开饭不及时，一百三十八个劳力早上未出工，那一天就少收回近两万斤谷。这是一个鲜明的对比。会上还算了一笔账：全队有一百八十七个有小孩拖累的妇女，如果不把托儿所办好，妇女们不能安心生产，六天就要少做八千九百多个工分。灯不拨不亮，事不辩不明。干部思想统一后，全队就抽出二十九个党员、十一个团员，加强集体福利事业部门工作；并调整了十栋光线好、空气好的住房做托儿所。妇女们都积极出工了。全队出工人数由一千二百多人增加到二千多人。
    关于集体生活能不能管好的问题，平江各地经验证明，只要党委重视，加强领导，充分发动群众，是完全能够把集体生活管理好的。如长寿人民公社志福大队第一公共食堂，原来办得不好，群众反映：“还不如各搞各的好！”社里把共产党员喻名兴等派到食堂工作后，首先召开一百六十二人的积极分子会，开展大鸣大放大辩论，讨论如何搞好伙食。群众贴出二百六十三张大字报，提出很多合理化建议。食堂工作人员根据社员意见，定期公布账目，还订出“五好”公约。食堂共养猪二百五十头、鸡鸭三百二十五只，种蔬菜三十五亩；并设立男女洗澡堂；每餐起码有两菜一汤，又便宜。社员都高兴地说：“到底是公共食堂好。这下，我们只管安心乐意搞生产了。”
    现在，全县各公社公共食堂都由社员自己选举了伙食管理委员会，工作已经走上正轨。全县食堂种菜一万多亩，养猪六万八千二百多头，鸡鸭四十一万多只，养鱼四十八万多尾。
    平江各地经验证明，书记挂帅，在服务员中开展评比竞赛运动，拔白旗，插红旗，是推动当前集体福利事业的一个好办法。梅仙人民公社党委书记戴开发在团山大队，亲自下厨房，和群众一道办好了伙食，被群众称为“十好”公共食堂。全社一百六十一名炊事员在这里开了现场会议，鼓舞了大家搞好伙食的信心。接着，在全社服务员中，开展了服务态度好、清洁卫生好、钱少菜好、菜蔬多样味道好和茶水用水及时好等“五好”评比竞赛。结果，评选出十一个“五好”单位，插起了红旗；许多炊事员被评为模范。
    平江县通过组织集体生活，全县出勤率由原来占总人口50％左右上升到占74％。到10月23日止，全县三十万亩晚稻、十万亩红薯及豆子、花生、棉花等作物，都及时抢收完毕，其他秋种、深耕等工作也开展得很好。
