    Party Secretary Takes Charge of Running the Canteen
    By our reporter Zhang Jianhong
    The Number 17 Canteen of the Red Flag Commune in Mengjin County, Henan Province, has complete tables and chairs. Each table is numbered, and each person's bowl and chopsticks bag are also numbered. I arrived there at nine o'clock that morning and just caught up with their breakfast. The canteen prepared thin porridge, vegetable soup, and "gold and silver rolls" (馒头, steamed buns) for everyone. The elderly ate soft steamed buns, and the children ate various pastries. A little girl named Han Xiuzhi ate chicken-shaped snacks while drinking sweet and fragrant sweet potato and corn porridge. Mothers ate while feeding their children. Across from the dining hall, there was also a very unique and spacious dining room, sparsely furnished with three sets of tables and chairs, which was used to entertain the commune members' relatives and friends. The guests ate even more variety and better quality of food. I also acted as a guest here once and ate a "full table of fragrance" including fourteen dishes. Besides stir-fried cabbage, pickled radish shreds, and egg soup, the rest of the dishes were mainly sweet potatoes, made with flour or corn flour. However, because the method was clever, we ate sweet potatoes without seeing sweet potatoes. Now, this canteen can make more than two hundred kinds of dishes, and there are many kinds of pastries. Commune members can eat different dishes every month.
    This canteen also has the characteristic of integrating eating with cultural and political life. The canteen is equipped with a conference room, a reception room, and a study room cum recreation room. Therefore, after meals, people don't have to run around. They can hold meetings, attend classes, and sing and play here. On the four walls of the entire courtyard, there are also columns for airing opinions, commendation, criticism, suggestions, accounts, menu, and reading newspapers. Commune members freely make commendations or criticisms here.
    The commune was established on August 1, and the canteen was opened at the same time. Initially, the canteen was not run well, and the commune members had many opinions. Party Secretary Yang Zixin, in order to change this situation, ate and drank at the same stove with the masses and quickly discovered many problems: in the twenty-one meals from August 9th to 16th, the commune members did not have a good steamed bun. Good grain was not made delicious. Some meals and dishes were not suitable for the elderly and children. …The root cause was that the cooks were not at ease with their work, thinking that cooking was an inglorious "dirty job". They did not do a good job of the food. Furthermore, the cadres did not eat in this canteen. They only focused on production and did not care whether the canteen food was good or bad.
    After Yang Zixin found out the details, he and Wang Rui, the battalion party secretary who ate in the canteen, immediately took three measures: abolish the cadre canteen and let all cadres eat in the mass canteen; convene a meeting of cooks to conduct communist education; rely on the masses to find ways to run the canteen well. That night, a mass forum was held in the canteen to discuss the issue of eating well and eating one's fill. At the meeting, production team leader Han Qiucheng put forward the experience that "well-prepared wild vegetables can also taste delicious, but if they are not well-prepared, pork can also be made into a pot of chaff." Yang Zixin understood from his words that the key to eating well and eating one's fill was "to know how to adjust and to have more vegetables." Therefore, he proposed that we should eat small steamed vegetable buns the next morning. The cooks were already afraid that there would not be enough food, and now they all thought that his request was too high and could not be achieved. However, in the middle of the night, he led the Party Committee and the work team comrades to the kitchen, chopped small radishes, cabbage, and sweet potato leaves finely, added spices, and started making buns. At this time, the cooks were very moved to see the secretary personally cooking. Those who were not at ease with their work also actively participated. Then they made a big pot of five-flavor soup with eggs and vegetables. Everyone ate this breakfast happily and praised it as well-made. After the meal, Yang Zixin and others assisted the cooks in making a detailed plan for the canteen food, so that the variety of food was renewed to meet the needs of the masses. Then the canteen added water for washing faces, boiled water, and mouthwash, and set up salt, scallions, garlic, chili, and vinegar. From September, they began to implement different dishes for every meal of the month. And different diets were prescribed for the elderly, children, patients, women in childbirth, and pregnant women.
    From then on, the canteen took on a new look. The masses named the canteen "Ruyi Stove" (如意灶, Wish-Fulfilling Stove) and gave the canteen the title of "Happy Paradise." Han Jinshan, who was sixty-five years old, was initially unwilling to eat in the canteen. Now, when he talked about canteen life, he was excited and radiant, saying that he was living more and more happily. The canteen took special care of the elderly, and even his own daughters-in-law and daughters had not treated him so well.
    The Seventeenth Canteen is continuing to move forward. I visited the canteen's processing plant, which has workshops for making flour, baking bread, grinding flour, slicing, and shredding. A slicing machine equipped with ball bearings can slice 140,000 catties (70,000 kg) of sweet potato slices or radish slices a day. The shredding machine can shred more than 2,000 catties (1,000 kg) of radish shreds or sweet potato shreds a day. According to the opinion of the commune Party committee, self-made tap water pipes will be installed in the canteen within the year, and biogas will be used to generate electricity for lighting and cooking. We must reduce the physical labor of the canteen through semi-mechanization, so that the cooks can make the food better, have pastries for every meal, drink good soup for every meal, so that the commune members can eat better and concentrate on doing a good job in production.

    书记动手办食堂
    本报记者　张健虹
    河南孟津县红旗公社第十七食堂桌椅板凳齐全，桌桌编有号码，各人的碗筷袋子上面，也都编了号码。那天上午九时，我来这里正好赶上他们开早饭。食堂给大家准备了稀粥、菜汤、金银卷，老年人吃的软面馍馍，孩子吃的是各样糕点。一个叫韩秀芝的小姑娘，一面吃鸡娃娃点心，一面端起又甜又香的红薯玉米粥来喝。母亲们一面自己吃，一面喂孩子。饭厅对面，还有一间很别致、宽畅的饭厅，疏朗地安放了三套桌凳，这是招待社员们亲朋友好吃饭的所在。客人们吃的饭菜，花样更多，质量也更好。我也在这里作了一次客，吃的是包括十四种菜的“满桌香”。除了炒白菜，腌萝卜丝，鸡蛋汤之外，其余的菜都是以红薯为主，用面粉或玉米粉调制而成的。但是，因为做法巧妙，我们吃了红薯不见红薯。现在，这个食堂能做出菜饭二百多种，糕点花样很多，社员一月都能吃到不同样的菜饭。
    这个食堂还具有把吃饭和文化政治生活融汇在一起的特色。食堂里面设有会议室，招待室，学习室兼游艺室。因此，饭后人们不用跑路，就可以在这儿开会、上课、弹唱。在整个院落的四墙，还设有鸣放、表扬、批评、建议、账目、菜饭单、阅报等栏。社员自由地在这里进行表扬或批评。
    8月1日公社成立，同时开办了这个食堂。最初食堂办得不好，社员有不少意见。党委书记杨自信为了改变这种状况，就和群众在一个灶上吃喝，很快发现了许多问题：从8月9日到16日的二十一顿饭中，社员没有好好吃上一顿馍，好粮做得不好吃，有些饭、菜不适合给老年人和孩子们吃。……追根究源，是炊事员不安心工作，认为做饭是不光荣的“下水活”，没有搞好伙食，再就是干部们不在这个食堂吃饭，光顾搞生产，对食堂吃好吃坏不关心。
    杨自信摸到这个底细后，就和在食堂吃饭的营党委书记王瑞一起，立刻采取了三个措施：撤销干部食堂，让所有干部都到群众食堂吃饭；召开炊事员会议，进行共产主义教育；依靠群众，从群众中找办好食堂的办法。这天晚上，在食堂召开了群众座谈会，讨论吃饱吃好的问题。会上生产队长韩秋成提出了“调剂好了野菜也做得啧啧香，调剂不好，猪肉也会做成一锅糠”的经验。杨自信从他话里懂得了吃好吃饱的关键是“要会调剂，要蔬菜多”。因此，他便提出第二天早上要吃小笼菜包。炊事员早就怕粮食不够吃，现在听到他的话都认为要求太高作不到。但是，到了半夜，他领着党委会和工作组的同志来到了厨房，把小萝卜、小白菜、红薯叶切得细细的，加上香料，做起包子来。这时炊事员见到书记亲自动手做饭，心里都十分感动；原来不安心工作的人，也积极干了起来。接着他们做了一大锅有蛋有菜的五味汤。这一顿早饭大家吃得欢天喜地，纷纷称道作得好。饭后，杨自信等协助炊事员把食堂菜饭做了详细规划，使饭菜花样翻新，满足群众需要。接着食堂添备了洗脸水、白开水、漱口水，设置了盐、葱蒜、辣椒、醋。从9月份起开始实行一月顿顿不重样的菜饭。并规定了老人、小孩、病人、产妇、孕妇等的不同伙食。
    从此以后，食堂面貌一新，群众给食堂起名“如意灶”，又送给食堂“幸福乐园”的称号。六十五岁的韩金山，起先不愿到食堂吃饭，现在他谈到食堂生活时，兴奋得满面红光，说他越活越幸福，食堂照顾老年人特别周到，就是自己的媳妇闺女也没有对他这样好。
    第十七食堂正在继续前进。我参观了食堂的加工厂，里面有制粉、烘面包、磨粉、切片、切丝等车间。一架装有滚珠轴承的切片机，一天能切十四万斤红薯片或萝卜片。切丝机一天可切二千多斤萝卜丝或山芋丝。按照社党委的意见，年内还要给食堂安上土制自来水管，采用沼气发电照明和烧饭。要通过半机械化的道路来减轻食堂的体力劳动，让炊事员把食物做得更好，顿顿有糕点，顿顿喝好汤，使社员吃得更好，专心搞好生产。
