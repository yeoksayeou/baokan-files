Xinhua News Agency, November 11th, New York dispatch: The American weekly "National Guardian" published on November 10th a public letter from American writer Anna Louise Strong, who is currently visiting China, to U.S. Senators Langer, Morse, and Humphrey, pointing out that the Chinese people firmly oppose the U.S. government's interference in China's internal affairs.

Strong said that as an American who is angered by the U.S. government's actions that have caused the United States to lose the friendship of the most populous country and the most polite people in the world, I am writing this letter from the heart of China.

She said that this letter is mainly to tell you that, in my opinion, the Chinese refuse to discuss a "ceasefire" with Mr. Dulles. She said that partly because Dulles deliberately obscures the matter, and partly because Americans are accustomed to interfering in the affairs of other countries, Americans fail to realize how a nation that is very sensitive about its sovereignty and has paid attention to details for thousands of years views this.

Strong pointed out that the Chinese government is very willing to negotiate with the Taiwan authorities to end the civil war and seek national reunification. She wrote that they proposed peaceful negotiations, saying that their civil war has continued for thirty years, and they are very willing to end it through negotiations.

Strong said, however, that the Chinese do not want to negotiate a "ceasefire" with Dulles because: "They do not recognize him (Dulles) as a mediator in their (Chinese) civil war... Who would recognize that? They are not at war with the United States, so they do not want to discuss a 'ceasefire' which implies that they are at war with the United States." Strong pointed out that China believes that "Dulles' 'insistence' (referring to his insistence on the so-called 'ceasefire' - editor) is a hypocritical trick aimed at affirming the U.S. interference in China's civil war and tacitly occupying the right to Formosa (referring to Taiwan). They believe that the only point of concern to them regarding the United States is: When are you going home?"

Strong also wrote enthusiastically in the letter about the great construction work that the Chinese people are carrying out. She wrote: "I want to stay (in China) for a period of time to fulfill what I see as a noble responsibility: to tell my compatriots (Americans) about what they need to know if we are to avoid a major war." She said, "First of all, this country is very vibrant: spirited, and most of its 600 million people seem to be working all day, studying all night, and occasionally cheering for some bright ideal for their country's future. I think there has never been a revival like this in history: hundreds of new factories, power plants, hotels, workers' residential areas; hundreds of small dams and dozens of large dams, taming the Huai River, preliminary taming of the Yellow River, plans to turn the Yangtze River, floods into canals, hydroelectric dams and irrigation systems all over China, millions of acres of newly irrigated land, and tens of millions of newly planted trees... This year's grain production has doubled compared to last year, and cotton production has also doubled. Now China's cotton production is said to be the world's largest, and steel production will also double this year..."

Strong said, "We have lost contact with these people, and the loss to the United States is irreparable, but if we provoke a war, our losses will be even greater."

### 斯特朗函告美国参议员  中国人的事不容杜勒斯插手

    斯特朗函告美国参议员
    中国人的事不容杜勒斯插手
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：11月10日一期的美国“国民前卫”周刊刊载了正在访问中国的美国女作家安娜·路易斯·斯特朗写给美国参议员朗格、莫尔斯和汉弗莱的一封公开信，指出中国人民坚决反对美国政府干涉中国内政。
    斯特朗说，作为一个对美国政府使美国失去了世界上人口最多的国家和最有礼貌的人民的友谊这种做法感到愤怒的美国人，我从中国的中心写了这一封信。
    她说，这封信主要是告诉你们，照我看来中国人拒绝同杜勒斯先生讨论“停火”的意思。她说，部分是由于杜勒斯有意遮盖这件事，部分是由于美国人习惯于干涉其他国家的事情，以致美国人认识不到对于自己的主权很敏感而且几千年来讲究细节的一个国家的看法怎么样。
    斯特朗指出，中国政府是十分愿意同台湾当局谈判结束内战，谋求国家统一的。她写道，他们建议谈判和平，他们说，他们的内战已经继续了三十年，他们很愿意通过谈判来结束内战。
    斯特朗说，但是中国人不愿同杜勒斯谈判“停火”，因为：“他们不承认他（杜勒斯）是他们（中国人）内战中的调停人……谁会承认呢？他们没有同美国作战，因此不愿意讨论‘停火’而含有他们在同美国作战的意思。”斯特朗指出，中国认为“杜勒斯的‘坚持态度’（指坚持所谓“停火”——编者）是一个伪善的诡计，目的是肯定美国干涉中国内战，并且含蓄地占领福摩萨（指台湾）的权利。他们认为他们的利益涉及到美国的仅有的一点是：你们何时回家？”
    斯特朗还在信中热情地写到中国人民正在进行的伟大建设工作。她写道：“我要（在中国）逗留一个时期，以履行在我看来是一项崇高的责任：告诉我国（美国）同胞关于他们需要知道的东西，如果我们要避免一场恶战的话。”她说，“首先，这个国家非常富于朝气：精神抖擞，它的六亿人民中的大多数看来是整天工作，通宵学习，而且不时地为自己国家的未来的某种光明理想而欢欣鼓舞。我想，历史上从来没有过像这样的复兴：成百的新工厂、发电厂、旅馆、工人住宅区；数以百计的小水坝和几十个大水坝、驯服淮河、初步驯服黄河，把长江、洪水变为运河的计划、发电水坝和灌溉系统布满中国整个版图，数以百万英亩计的新灌溉区以及数以千万计的新种植的树木……今年的粮食生产比去年翻一番，棉花也增产一倍，现在中国棉花产量号称世界第一，钢产量今年也将增加一倍……。”
    斯特朗说，“我们失去同这些人民的接触，美国这样的损失是无法补偿的，但是如果我们挑起战争，我们的损失将更大。”
