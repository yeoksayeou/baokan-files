This is a Marxist “Concession”
Tong Wanshu

In the discussion of the issue of changing from the supply system to the wage system, opinions vary, with some saying it is a regression and others saying it is progress. I believe it is neither a regression nor progress, but rather a Marxist “concession” made by the Party to bourgeois legalism under certain historical conditions. The Party is aware of this "concession" and has considered its impact and consequences. Moreover, this "concession" is required by the complexity of revolutionary practice. The reason I understand this issue in this way is because when we discuss this issue, we inevitably involve the question of whether the Party's distribution policy after liberation was correct. The practice after liberation proves that the Party's distribution policy is undoubtedly correct. If we simply and generally say that changing the supply system to the wage system is a regression, compromise, or concession, it will inevitably lead to the conclusion that the Party made mistakes in its distribution policy. This is obviously not in accordance with the facts.

Although this change is not a regression, it must still be emphasized today that it is, after all, a "concession," and not, as Comrade He Peixing's article says, "progress."

    这是马克思主义式的“让步”
    童畹书
    在供给制改工资制这一问题讨论中，意见纷纭，有人说是倒退，有人说是前进。我认为既非倒退，亦非前进，乃是在一定的历史条件下，党对资产阶级法权思想的一种马克思主义式的“让步”。这种“让步”党是意识到的，考虑到了它的影响和后果。而且这种“让步”是革命实践中的复杂性所要求的。我所以这样来认识这一问题，是因为我们在论述这一问题时，必然涉及到解放后党的分配政策是否正确的问题。解放后的实践证明，党的分配政策无疑是正确的。如果把供给制改工资制简单而笼统的说成是倒退、妥协、让步，那就必然会导致党在分配政策上是犯了错误的结论。这显然是不合事实的。
    虽然这一改变不是倒退，但今天还必须强调指出，它毕竟是“让步”，而不是像何培煋同志的文章中所说的：“是前进。”
