Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: With the support of the Nobusuke Kishi government, the United States is turning Japan into a military base for its military provocations in the Taiwan Straits. The Nobusuke Kishi government is also attempting to take the opportunity to meddle in Taiwan and regain hegemony in East Asia.

Under long-term American military occupation, Japan has long been a major base for American aggression in the Far East. Since the United States provoked tensions in the Taiwan Straits in August this year, just as during the American war of aggression against Korea in 1950, the entire American military base system in Japan has been operating tensely. Among them, the important Japanese naval port of Kure has become a supply station for the US military to supply munitions to the Taiwan region. According to revelations by the "Akahata" (Red Flag newspaper), the munitions transport work at this base has greatly increased with the increasing severity of American military provocations in the Taiwan Straits. The US military has hired a large number of temporary workers to load and transport munitions day and night. Trucks from large and small transport companies in Kure have been requisitioned by the US military. The roads are crowded with trucks transporting American munitions. Ships carrying American munitions stream in and out of the port of Kure. On September 13 alone, five American freighters with a displacement of 5,000 to 10,000 tons sailed into the port to load munitions. The words "US-China Friendship" were even written on the ammunition boxes. Some of the munitions were even transported out of the warehouse before they could be packed. It is estimated that by the end of September, 80,000 tons of munitions had been transported from the three ammunition depots in Kure.

The US Seventh Fleet, which is tasked with obstructing the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan in the Taiwan Straits, has always been based in Japan and Okinawa. After the United States provoked tensions in the Taiwan Straits, the American troops based in Japan more actively carried out war preparations. Rear Admiral Whittington, commander of the US naval forces in Japan, announced on August 25 that the ships and personnel under his command were on heightened alert. The next day, the US Fifth Air Force in Japan was also ordered to maintain a state of alert, and a spokesman for the Air Force said that some of the Air Force's aircraft were already performing "temporary missions" in Taiwan. Other US military units stationed in Japan also directly participated in activities that created tension in the Taiwan area. When the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique held joint military exercises in southern Taiwan on September 8, 1,800 American soldiers were transferred from the Iwakuni base in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. The Iwakuni base is the base of the US First Marine Division. The US military has built a runway here that is 8,000 meters long and can accommodate any type of aircraft. According to newspaper reports, the base stores atomic bombs. The 3,000 US troops at the Iwakuni base have been in a state of readiness for combat since the US military began occupying Lebanon. The local US military was originally scheduled to withdraw most of its troops in October this year, but now, according to the order of the US government, it has been decided to maintain the status quo for the next three years. In Tokyo, the US Air Force Tachikawa base has also been very active since the situation in the Taiwan Straits became tense, and the workload of the base workers has increased dramatically.

After the United States carried out military provocations in the Taiwan Straits, many senior American military personnel visited Japan one after another to conduct war deployments. These people included US Pacific Commander Harry Felt, US Secretary of the Army Brucker, US Pacific Army Commander White, US Air Force Vice Chief of Staff LeMay, US Secretary of Defense McElroy, and Army Chief of Staff Taylor. At the same time, the United States has continuously strengthened the strength of the US military stationed in Japan. In early October, the US Navy dispatched two jet squadrons from Hawaii to Japan.

The Japanese munitions industry has also become an arsenal for the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Nagasaki Mitsubishi Shipbuilding is manufacturing torpedoes for the Chiang gang.

The Nobusuke Kishi government not only actively supported the US actions in deploying troops and generals in Japan to create tensions in the Taiwan Straits, but also openly sheltered them. The Soviet government revealed in a memorandum to the Nobusuke Kishi government on September 16 this year that the US armed forces were directly using Japanese territory to invade China. However, the Nobusuke Kishi government openly defended the US aggression and reversed black and white to say that the crisis in the Taiwan Straits was caused by China. Nobusuke Kishi recently exposed his imperialist ambitions and attempts to invade China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea even more blatantly when he was interviewed by Brown, a reporter from NBC. He openly said: "For Japan, it is absolutely necessary not to let Korea and Formosa (Taiwan) fall into the hands of the communists." He also strongly advocated amending the constitution to clear the way for Japan to send troops abroad. In the negotiations on revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty", the United States and Japan are planning to expand the treaty area to the entire Western Pacific and are conspiring to establish a "Northeast Asian military alliance" between Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the Syngman Rhee clique.

While actively following the US in creating the "Two Chinas" conspiracy, the Nobusuke Kishi government is also fostering the Liao Wenyi clique in Japan to carry out the "Taiwan independence movement." Nobusuke Kishi, who was once an active organizer of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," has always wanted to relive the old dream of occupying Taiwan.

The activities of the United States in using Japanese bases to carry out war adventures have caused unease among the Japanese public. The Japanese people resist the US efforts to turn Japan into a springboard for war and strongly oppose the Nobusuke Kishi government's attitude of hostility toward China and willingness to serve as an accomplice of US aggression against China. A mass movement against the US turning Japan into a base of aggression and against the Nobusuke Kishi's policy of hostility toward China is booming in Japan.

### 妄想染指台湾重新称霸东亚  岸信介甘把日本变为美国侵略基地

    妄想染指台湾重新称霸东亚
    岸信介甘把日本变为美国侵略基地
    新华社31日讯　美国在岸信介政府的支持下，正在把日本变成它在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅活动的军事基地。岸信介政府并且妄图乘机染指台湾，重新称霸东亚。
    在美国的长期军事占领下，日本早已成为美国侵略远东的主要基地。今年8月美国在台湾海峡地区挑起紧张局势以后，就像美国在1950年发动侵朝战争的时期一样，在日本的整个美国军事基地体系就紧张地活动起来。其中，日本的重要军港吴市成了美军向台湾地区供应军火的补给站。据“赤旗报”揭露，这个基地的军火运输工作，随着美国在台湾海峡的军事挑衅日益严重而大大增加。美军大批招雇临时工人，日夜装运军火。吴市的大小搬运公司的卡车，都被美军征用去了。公路上挤满了运送美国军火的卡车。在吴市港口，装载美国军火的船只川流不息。仅在9月13日一天，就有五艘排水量五千吨到一万吨的美国货轮开入港口，装运军火。在弹药箱上竟然写着“美中友好”等字样。有的军火在运出仓库时，甚至来不及装箱。据估计，到9月下旬为止，从吴市的三个军火库已经运出八万吨军火。
    在台湾海峡地区担任阻挠中国人民解放自己领土台湾的任务的美国第七舰队，一直是以日本和冲绳为基地的。在美国挑起台湾海峡紧张局势以后，以日本为基地的美国军队更加积极地进行了备战活动。美国驻日本海军部队首脑威辛顿海军少将在8月25日就宣布在他指挥下的舰只和人员处于加强的戒备状态。第二天，美国驻日本的第五航空队也奉命保持戒备状态，这个航空队的发言人并且说，这个航空队的一部分飞机已经在台湾执行“临时任务”。驻日美军其他部队也直接参加了在台湾地区制造紧张局势的活动。当9月8日美国和蒋介石集团在台湾南部举行联合军事演习的时候，有一千八百名美军是从日本山口县的岩国基地调去的。岩国基地是美国第一海军陆战队的根据地。美军在这里修筑了可供任何种类飞机降落的长八千公尺的跑道。据报纸报道，这个基地储存有原子弹。岩国基地的三千名美军，自从美军开始侵占黎巴嫩以后，一直处于随时可以进行战斗的准备状态中。当地的美军原定在今年10月撤走大部分部队，但是，现在根据美国政府的命令，已经决定在今后三年内维持现状。在东京，美国空军立川基地在台湾海峡地区局势紧张以后，也活动频繁，基地工人的工作量急剧增加。
    在美国在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅以后，很多美国高级军事人员接踵访问日本，进行战争部署。这些人包括美军太平洋总司令哈里费尔特，美国陆军部长布鲁克，美国太平洋陆军总司令怀特，美国空军副参谋长李梅，美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊和陆军参谋长泰勒。同时，美国不断增强驻日美军的实力，10月上旬，美国海军部从夏威夷增派了两个喷气机中队到日本。
    日本军火工业也成了蒋介石集团的兵工厂。长崎三菱造船公司就在为蒋帮制造鱼雷。
    岸信介政府对美国在日本调兵遣将到台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势的行动，不但积极支持，并且公然加以庇护。苏联政府在今年9月16日给岸信介政府的备忘录中曾经揭露美国武装力量直接利用日本领土侵略中国的事实。但是岸信介政府公然为美国的侵略行为辩护，并且颠倒黑白说台湾海峡的危机是中国引起的。岸信介最近对美国全国广播公司的记者布朗发表谈话时更加露骨地暴露了他的帝国主义野心和侵略中国及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的企图。他公然说：“对日本来说，不让朝鲜和福摩萨（台湾）落入共产党人手中是绝对必要的。”他并且极力主张修改宪法以为日本派兵出国扫清道路。美国和日本在修改日美“安全条约”的谈判中，正在策划把条约地区扩大到整个西太平洋，并且阴谋建立日本、蒋介石集团、李承晚集团之间的“东北亚军事同盟”。
    岸信介政府在积极追随美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋的同时，还在日本卵翼廖文毅集团，进行“台湾独立运动”。曾经是“大东亚共荣圈”的积极组织者的岸信介，一直在想重温侵占台湾的旧梦。
    美国利用日本基地进行战争冒险的活动，在日本公众中引起了不安。日本人民抵制美国把日本当作战争跳板的活动，并且强烈反对岸信介政府敌视中国、甘心充当美国侵略中国的帮凶的态度。一个群众性的反对美国把日本当作侵略基地、反对岸信介敌视中国的政策的运动，正在日本蓬勃开展。
