The foundation for its No. 1 large blast furnace was started on the 14th. On the same day, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for the No. 1 blast furnace. Tan Yubao, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the ceremony and cut the ribbon.

In just eight months, they have essentially completed more than 30 major projects, including base construction, a wire rod plant, a metal structure plant, and a coking plant. The metal products plant, machine repair plant, and power plant are also nearing completion and will soon be put into production. Now, all the employees building the blast furnace have proposed to complete the No. 1 blast furnace ahead of schedule to ensure iron production next year.

    湘潭建钢铁联合企业
    据新华社长沙20日电　湖南省开始建设一个大型钢铁联合企业——湘潭钢铁公司。它的第一号大型高炉已在14日动工浇灌基础。当天，举行了一号高炉开工典礼大会，中共湖南省委书记谭余保曾到会剪彩。
    湘潭钢铁公司将分期建成。它的建设对湖南省建立现代化工业将起重大作用。明年，这个公司就将出铁出钢，生产线材、钢丝、钢绳等。
    湘潭钢铁公司是今年3月开工的。自开工以来，全体职工战胜了连绵阴雨和炎热的气候，克服了人力物力困难，在短短八个月中，已经基本上完成了基地建设、线材厂、金属结构厂、焦化厂等三十多项重大工程；金属制品厂、机修厂、动力厂也即将建成投入生产。现在，建设高炉的全体职工，又提出要提前将一号高炉建成，保证明年出铁。
