    "Much Richer" and "Far Behind"
    Ruan Yanshun
    Americans are seizing every opportunity and using every method to show that they are not paper tigers. On October 28, an American reporter asked Dulles: Why do the Soviets advocate a permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing? Dulles replied: "...to make the Soviets open their eyes to the fact that our own knowledge of nuclear weapons and the use of nuclear energy to make weapons is much richer than theirs; they realize that they are far behind in this matter."
    Dulles' words made us all "open our eyes" as well: It turns out that the Americans' nuclear weapons knowledge is "much richer" than the Soviets'! So, who "made the Soviets open their eyes"? This probably should be credited to the U.S. Department of Defense.
    The U.S. Department of Defense took the lead by organizing a specialized "scientific institution" to study the question of under what conditions it would be more appropriate to surrender in a nuclear war. The research resulted in "rich" knowledge of surrendering in the face of nuclear weapons, and it is said that a book was even published. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, is "far behind" in this regard, and has not even thought of studying this kind of learning to this day. Dulles triumphantly boasted that the United States has "much richer" knowledge than the Soviet Union, which indeed has a very practical basis.
    However, the Soviets also saw another "far behind" "fact," which the U.S. Secretary of Defense also "opened their eyes" to. It is rumored that the U.S. Secretary of Defense testified at a secret and important meeting that the United States has not only currently, but also for a considerable period of time, been unable to find a way to defend against Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Soviet Union's "lag" in nuclear weapons to the point where the Americans cannot find a way to defend against them can indeed be considered a "far behind."
    It is precisely: Lagging so far behind as to be difficult to defend,
        Knowledge so lacking as to not know how to surrender;
        How enviable is America's great progress,
        Unparalleled in the world in knowledge of surrender.

### “丰富得多”和“大大落后”

    “丰富得多”和“大大落后”
    阮延顺
    美国人正在抓一切机会，利用一切方法来表现自己并非是一只纸老虎。10月28日，有位美国记者问杜勒斯：苏联人为什么主张永久停止核武器的试验？杜勒斯回答说：“……使苏联睁开眼睛看到了这个事实：我们自己关于核武器和利用核能制造武器的知识，比他们的要丰富得多；他们认识到，他们在这件事情上大大落后了”。
    杜勒斯的话使我们大家也“睁开眼睛”：原来美国人比苏联的核武器知识“丰富得多”啊！那末，又是谁“使苏联睁开眼睛”的呢？这大概要归功于美国的国防部。
    美国国防部捷足先登，组织了专门“科学机构”，研究了在一场核战争中，在什么样的条件下投降更得当的问题，研究结果，取得了在核武器面前投降的“丰富”知识，据说还出了书。而苏联在这方面却“大大落后了”，至今连想也不想去研究这一类学问。杜勒斯洋洋得意地大嚷美国比苏联知识“丰富得多”，的确有着很切实的根据。
    不过苏联人也看到了另一个“大大落后了”的“事实”，这也是美国的国防部长先生使它“睁开眼睛”的。据传，美国国防部长在一次秘密的重要会议上作证说，对于苏联的洲际弹道导弹，美国不仅目前，而且在一个相当长的时间内，还找不出防御的办法来。苏联人在核武器方面“落后”到美国人找不出防御办法，也真算得上是一个“大大”的了。
    正是：落后大到难防御，
        知识乏得不知降；
        堪羡美国大进步，
        投降知识世无双。
