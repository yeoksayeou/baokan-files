Xinhua News Agency, November 11th — The Albanian newspaper "Zëri i Popullit" published a commentary on November 11, condemning the UN General Assembly Political Committee's one-sided discussion of the Korean issue, stating: "It can be clearly seen from the discussions in the UN General Assembly Political Committee that the United States is deliberately delaying the resolution of the Korean issue and setting up numerous obstacles to its resolution.

The commentary stated that the resolution discussed and passed by the UN General Assembly Political Committee under US pressure is wrong. It not only violates the principles of the UN General Assembly and international law, but also stands in opposition to the interests of Democratic Korea.

The commentary pointed out that the UN Political Committee once again deprived the representatives of the Korean people of the right to speak at the UN General Assembly, while instead recognizing the representatives of the US puppet Syngman Rhee clique, who do not represent any Korean people. The commentary emphasized: "The Korean issue can only be resolved by the Korean people themselves."

The commentary concluded by saying that the Albanian people are following and supporting the Korean people's just struggle for the reunification of Korea with great concern. The Albanian people and the people of the world welcome the efforts made by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, representing the interests of the motherland and the heroic Korean people.

Xinhua News Agency, November 10th — The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published a commentary today on the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Korean issue.

The commentary said: "On the eve of the UN discussion of the Korean issue, the Chinese People's Volunteers had completely withdrawn from Korea. The decision to withdraw troops from Korea stemmed from the sincere desire of the Korean and Chinese sides to do everything possible to ease the tension in Korea, to make the armistice a lasting peace, and to create conditions for the Korean people to be able to peacefully and freely unify into one country."

The commentary continued: However, "the United States does not have this desire."

The commentary supported TASS's recent statement on the UN's promotion of the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, and pointed out that now is the time for the UN to take corresponding measures to withdraw the US troops from Korea who are flying the UN flag.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, November 11th — "Al-Bilad" said today in a commentary on the Korean issue that the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea some time ago so that the reunification of Korea could be achieved through democratic elections under the supervision of a neutral international body, but the US troops stubbornly remain in South Korea.

The newspaper said that it is clear that the United States is afraid to withdraw from South Korea because the South Korean people hate the dictatorial regime it has fostered.

Xinhua News Agency, November 11th — The Jakarta "Harian Rakjat" published an editorial today calling for the withdrawal of US troops from Korea.

The editorial said that the Chinese People's Volunteers have withdrawn from Korea, and this action once again shows China's sincerity in striving for peace. In contrast, the United States insists on staying there and even openly stated that the US military is unwilling to withdraw from Korea.

The editorial pointed out that talking about peace in words, but acting warlike, this is the true nature of US imperialism.

The editorial said that the people of the world have a responsibility to continue to demand that US troops immediately withdraw from Korea in order to turn a powder keg in the Far East into a region without danger and a region of peace and security.

    美国侵略军必须撤出南朝鲜
    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”说：
    朝鲜问题应由朝鲜人民解决
    据新华社11日讯　阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”11日发表评论，谴责联合国大会政治委员会片面讨论朝鲜问题说：“从联合国大会政治委员会的讨论中可以清楚地看到美国存心拖延解决朝鲜问题并为这一问题的解决布置了重重障碍。
    评论说，联合国大会政治委员会在美国压力下讨论和通过的决议是错误的。它不但不符合联合国大会原则和国际公法，而且和民主朝鲜的利益是相对立的。
    评论指出，联大政委会又一次地剥夺了朝鲜人民代表在联合国大会上的发言权，相反却承认了代表不了任何一个朝鲜人民的美国傀儡李承晚集团的代表。评论强调说：“朝鲜问题只有朝鲜人民自己才能解决。”
    评论最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民以巨大的关心注视和支持朝鲜人民统一朝鲜的正义斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界人民都欢迎朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表祖国和英勇的朝鲜人民的利益所作的努力。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”说：
    联合国有责任促使美军撤出朝鲜
    据新华社10日讯　保加利亚“工人事业报”今天就联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的讨论发表评论。
    评论说：“在联合国讨论朝鲜问题的前夕，中国人民志愿军部队已从朝鲜全部撤退完毕。从朝鲜撤出军队的决定是出于朝中方面的下列真诚愿望，即竭尽一切可能以求缓和朝鲜的紧张局势，使停战成为持久的和平，并创造条件使朝鲜人民能够和平而自由地统一成为一个国家”。
    评论接着说：但是，“美国方面却没有这种愿望”。
    评论支持塔斯社最近就联合国促使美军撤出南朝鲜问题所发表的声明，并指出，现在是时候了，联合国应该采取相应措施来使打着联合国旗号的美国军队从朝鲜撤退。
    伊拉克“国家报”说：
    南朝鲜人民憎恨美国的傀儡政权
    新华社巴格达11日电　“国家报”今天在评论朝鲜问题时说，中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜已经有好些时候了，以便朝鲜的统一有可能在中立国际机构监督下通过民主选举来实现，可是美国军队仍然顽固地留在南朝鲜。
    这家报纸说，很显然，美国害怕撤出南朝鲜，因为南朝鲜人民憎恨它扶植起来的独裁政权。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”说：
    美国帝国主义本色毕露
    据新华社11日讯　雅加达“人民日报”今天发表社论，要求美军撤出朝鲜。
    社论说，中国人民志愿军已经撤出朝鲜，这个行动再次表明了中国争取和平的诚意。但是与此相反，美国却坚持赖在那里，甚至公开表示美国军队不愿撤出朝鲜。
    社论指出，口头上谈和平，而行动却是好战的，这就是美帝国主义者的本色。
    社论说，全世界人民有责任继续要求美国军队立即撤出朝鲜，以便把远东的一个军火库变成没有危险的：而且是和平和安全的地区。
