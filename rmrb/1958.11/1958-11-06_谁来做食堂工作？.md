Who Should Do the Work in the Canteen?
    He Cheng

    Zhao Yongqin, a young female cook at the Xingtai Iron and Steel Hotel in Hebei, said: "I feel it is an honor to be a cook. Some people look down on this line of work, saying that cooking and serving dishes in a public canteen is 'serving people.' That's an old way of thinking, not understanding the importance of our work. As the saying goes, people are iron, and food is steel; you'll get hungry if you miss a meal. No one can do without eating. Besides, working in the canteen is different from cooking at home. Now, it's not for a small family, but for the service of the large commune." (See page 6 of this newspaper on October 29th). This is very true. Canteen work, like other socialist construction work, is noble and glorious. Chairman Mao, in his article "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," called on all revolutionary workers to care for and solve the problems of the masses, the problem of salt, the problem of rice, the problem of housing, the problem of clothing, and the problem of childbirth. He also said: Improving the lives of the masses is one of the two major tasks of revolutionaries. In fact, to do a good job in the canteen, to make food that suits the tastes of hundreds of people, is not an easy task. There is a lot of knowledge involved. The same sweet potato, some people only know how to boil or steam it in plain water, but others can make various delicious foods; the same coarse grains, some people can only treat it as coarse grains, but others can treat coarse grains as fine grains.

    However, many commune members, especially young commune members, regard canteen work as lowly and hopeless, saying that working in the canteen is not as good as being on the iron and steel front or the autumn harvest and planting front, where miracles can be created. Therefore, they are unwilling to work in the canteen, and even if they are assigned to work in the canteen, they reluctantly "ring the bell as long as they are a monk for the day," waiting to be transferred to other positions. Some commune leaders also believe that canteen work is heavy and dirty, and should not be done by poor and lower-middle peasants, let alone by young people, but only by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and other bad elements. They even say: This way, there will be people doing canteen work, and landlords, etc. will be subjected to labor reform. Under the guidance of this thinking, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and other bad elements have entered the canteen in large numbers.

    Recently, a reader wrote a letter reflecting that the political composition of canteen staff in a few people's communes is seriously impure, including landlords, rich peasants, and even counter-revolutionaries under surveillance. According to a typical survey of 235 canteens in Wuqing and Lixian counties, Hebei, among 859 administrators and cooks, there were 149 landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and other bad elements, accounting for 17.4% of all canteen staff. Precisely because no attention is paid to the political composition of canteen staff, there have been successive incidents of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries poisoning food, resulting in the poisoning of commune members.

    Who should do the work in the canteen? The conclusion can now be drawn: it should be outstanding commune members, not landlords, rich peasants, etc. Therefore, a group of outstanding commune members should be mobilized to work in the canteen. Among these commune members, there should be experienced elderly people and creative young people. Landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who have already infiltrated the canteen must be resolutely purged. Many places are already doing this, and that is correct.

    谁来做食堂工作？
    何成
    河北邢台钢铁饭店青年女炊事员赵永芹说：“我当炊事员感到是件光荣的事，有人瞧不起这行，说在公共食堂里作饭菜、端盘子是‘侍候人’的工作。那是脑子旧，不了解我们的工作重要。俗话说，人是铁，饭是钢，一顿不吃饿的慌。谁不吃饭也不成。再说，我在食堂干活和在家里作饭不同，现在不是为小家，是为公社的大家服务。”（见10月29日本报六版）这话说得很对，食堂工作和其他社会主义建设工作一样，是高尚的工作，光荣的工作。毛主席在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中，曾要一切革命工作人员关心、解决群众的生活问题，盐的问题，米的问题，房子的问题，衣的问题，生孩子的问题。又说：改善群众生活，是革命者的两大任务之一。事实上，要做好食堂工作，要使做出来的饭菜合乎千百个人的口味，这不是一件很容易的事情。这里边大有学问。同样是甘薯，有人只会用白水煮一煮或蒸一蒸，有人却能做各种可口的食品；同是粗粮，有人只能当粗粮做，有人却能把粗粮当做细粮做。
    但是有不少社员特别是青年社员，把食堂工作当做是下贱的工作，没出息的工作，说在食堂工作就不如在钢铁前线和秋收秋种前线，可以创造奇迹。因此不愿到食堂工作，即使被指派到食堂工作，也是无可奈何的“当一天和尚撞一天钟”，等待调到其他岗位上工作。而一部分公社领导干部，也认为食堂工作又重又脏，不能让贫农、中农去作，更不能让年青人去作，只能让地主、富农、反革命分子和其他坏分子去作，甚至说：这样，既有人做食堂工作，又对地主等实行了劳动改造。在这种思想指导之下，地主、富农、反革命分子和其他坏分子，也就大批地混进了食堂。
    最近就有一位读者来信，反映少数人民公社的食堂工作人员的政治成分严重不纯，其中有地主，有富农，甚至还有正在管制期间的反革命分子。据河北武清、蠡县等地二百三十五个食堂的典型调查，八百五十九名管理员和炊事员中，就有地主、富农、反革命分子及其他坏分子一百四十九名，占全部食堂工作人员的17.4％。正因为不注意食堂工作人员的政治成分，所以接连地发生了地主、富农和反革命分子在食品中投毒，社员中毒的事件。
    谁来做食堂的工作呢？这个问题现在可以得出结论了，应当是优秀的社员，而不是地主、富农等。因此，应当动员一批优秀的社员到食堂去工作。在这些社员中，既要有对作饭有经验的老年人，也要有富有创造精神的年青人。对于已经混进食堂的地主、富农、反革命分子，要坚决清除出去。现在已有不少地方在这样做，这是对的。
