    We Built Europe's Largest Blast Furnace
    By I. Kiriyenkov, Captain of the Comprehensive Installation Team of the Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant Construction Company
    On October 15th, Europe's largest blast furnace—the No. 5 blast furnace of the Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant—was put into production. Our blast furnace construction workers completed the project seventy-five days ahead of schedule. The blast furnace workers gave a good evaluation of the construction workers' work, which is the best reward for our labor.
    The blast furnace produced iron. In order to welcome the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the workers managing the new blast furnace are guaranteeing to produce 90,000 tons of iron by the end of the year. Every day I pass by the No. 5 blast furnace and see how the tank cars carrying the hot iron leave the casting yard. I see the huge smelting equipment constantly moving. I deeply realize that all of this was made with our own hands, and this is our gift to the historic congress of our dear Party.
    How did we construction workers achieve this labor victory? First of all, it is because of the unity and organization of the construction workers and installation workers, because we launched a competition and accumulated experience in quickly building blast furnaces, and widely adopted factory methods.
    Our project was completed by energetic and skilled workers who love their work, using the best machines. When the entire comprehensive project of the No. 5 blast furnace was fully underway, there were sixteen tower cranes, dozens of automatic cranes, and other construction machines in operation. This enabled us to carry out large-scale construction simultaneously in all aspects at a faster speed. The volume of the upper foundation of the blast furnace is 2,700 cubic meters, and we broke the record by pouring the concrete in just 57 hours. In the project of excavating the earth and making the ore car pit, we used a total of only twenty days and nights, but when repairing the No. 4 blast furnace, the same project took thirty days and nights.
    I have been working on construction projects in the motherland for twenty-three years. In Chelyabinsk, I installed the No. 3 and No. 4 blast furnaces, but I have never seen such a fast speed as the No. 5 blast furnace.
    During the construction of the No. 5 blast furnace, the Communist Youth League members put in a lot of effort. They initiated a competition to strive to complete the seven blast furnaces built in our country this year ahead of schedule. This competition attracted all our construction workers, and the struggle to complete the blast furnace ahead of schedule became a glorious cause for every metallurgical worker, concrete worker, steel bar worker, and carpenter. Good cadres were cultivated and trained in the construction project.
    The reorganization of industrial management and on-site leadership played a great role in speeding up the construction of the blast furnace. Forty-six national economic committees across the country manufactured orders for the construction project of the Chelyabinsk blast furnace, but most of the equipment required for the construction of the blast furnace was manufactured by factories in the Chelyabinsk economic zone.
    The appearance of the No. 5 blast furnace is similar to that of the No. 4 and No. 3 blast furnaces. But we construction workers know that this blast furnace is very different from other blast furnaces. The latest technical ideas of Soviet experts were adopted in the construction of this blast furnace. The blast furnace is operated by steam condensation method, so the industrial water required can be reduced by nine-tenths. In this way, we do not need to build a pumping station for the blast furnace workshop as stipulated in the standard design. The bottom of the furnace is made of high-alumina refractory material, which can prolong the life of the furnace; a rocking trough is installed on the casting plant, and some other new methods are also adopted.
    The experience of building the No. 5 blast furnace in Chelyabinsk enables us to build new blast furnaces faster and better in the future, enhance the production capacity of the South Ural steel plants, and successfully complete the tasks put forward by the Party to construction workers and installation workers.

    我们建成了欧洲最大的高炉
    车里雅宾斯克钢铁厂建筑公司综合安装队队长　伊·基里延科夫
    10月15日，一座欧洲最大的高炉——车里雅宾斯克钢铁厂五号高炉投入生产了。我们建筑高炉的工人提前七十五天交工。高炉工人对建筑工人的工作给了好的评价，这就是对我们劳动的最好的奖励。
    高炉出铁了。管理新高炉的工人为了迎接苏共第二十一次代表大会，保证到年底生产九万吨铁。我每天都经过五号高炉，并且看到运送灼热的铁的罐车怎样离开铸铁场。看到巨大的熔炼设备在不停地动转。我深深体会到，这一切都是用我们的双手作成的，这是我们对亲爱的党的历史性代表大会的献礼。
    我们建筑工人何以取得这个劳动上的胜利呢？这首先是因为建筑工人和安装工人的团结一致和组织性，因为我们展开了竞赛和积累了迅速建设高炉的经验，并且广泛采用了工厂化方法。
    我们的工程是由精力旺盛并热爱自己工作的熟练工人利用最好的机器完成的。当五号高炉全部综合工程充分展开的时候，有十六架塔式起重机、数十台自动起重机和其他建筑机器都在操作。这就使我们能够以更快的速度在各方面同时进行大规模施工。高炉的上基础的体积是二千七百立方公尺，我们打破纪录在短短的五十七小时内就浇灌完了混凝土。在挖土和作料车坑井的工程上，我们一共只用了二十昼夜，但是当修四号高炉的时候，同样工程却花费了三十昼夜。
    我在祖国的建筑工程上工作了二十三年了。在车里雅宾斯克我安装了三号和四号高炉，但是像五号高炉这样快的速度还从来没见过。
    在建设五号高炉中间，共青团员花了很多精力。他们倡议开展竞赛，争取提前建成我国今年修建的七座高炉。这个竞赛吸引了我们所有的建筑工人，为提前建成高炉的斗争成了每个冶金工作者、混凝土工、钢筋工和木工的光荣事业。在建筑工程中培养和锻炼出了好干部。
    工业管理的改组和就近领导，在加快高炉建设的速度方面起了很大的作用。全国有四十六个国民经济委员会为车里雅宾斯克的高炉建设工程制造了定货，但是建设高炉所需的大部分设备还是车里雅宾斯克经济区的工厂制造的。
    五号高炉的外表同四号、三号相似。但是我们建筑工人知道，这个高炉同其他高炉有很大的不同。建设这个高炉采用了苏联专家最新的技术思想，高炉是用蒸气冷凝法操作的，因此所需的工业用水可以减少十分之九。这样，我们就不必要修建标准设计中规定的高炉车间抽水站了。炉底是用高铝耐火材料作成的，可以延长炉的寿命；在铸铁厂上安装了摇动槽，此外还采用了其他一些新的方法。
    建设车里雅宾斯克五号高炉的经验，使我们将来能够更快、更好地建设新的高炉，增强南乌拉尔各钢铁厂的生产能力，顺利地完成党对建筑工人和安装工人提出的任务。
