Xinhua News Agency report: Hangzhou Second Hospital used berberine, Zhejiang Lin'an Sanatorium used sheep bile, and Jiaxing Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Institute used garlic liquid (tracheal drip) to treat a total of fifty-six patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, all of whom achieved significant results. According to the analysis of medical records, X-ray comparisons before and after treatment with these three traditional Chinese medicines showed that after three months of treatment, absorption and improvement of infiltrative lesions in tuberculosis patients reached 60%-83%, and tuberculous cavities shrank or disappeared. Among them, except for one case treated with berberine where the lesion spread, no lesions spread or deteriorated after taking the traditional Chinese medicines. In terms of the patients' disease symptoms, 100% showed varying degrees of improvement. The analysis of twenty-one patients treated with sheep bile at Zhejiang Lin'an Sanatorium showed that there were both male and female patients, aged from twenty-two to forty-five years old, all of whom were cadres. After long-term hospitalization and recuperation, the longest had been more than six years, and the shortest had been more than three months. All had taken oral or injected large amounts of anti-tuberculosis drugs such as streptomycin and isoniazid. Among them, four cases had also been treated with pulmonary collapse therapy without success. All twenty-one patients underwent X-ray examination before changing to sheep bile. Among them, ten cases were infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis, ten cases were chronic fibrotic cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis, and one case was subacute hematogenous disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis. Nineteen patients had tubercle bacilli found in their sputum, two patients had concurrent tracheal tuberculosis, thirteen patients had lesions on both sides of the lungs, and twelve patients had obvious cavities visible in the lungs. In order to observe the actual curative effect of sheep bile on pulmonary tuberculosis, Lin'an Sanatorium stopped the original anti-tuberculosis drugs in advance and switched to oral sheep bile powder, one gram per day. After three months of X-ray re-examination, it was proven that among the twenty-one patients, except for seven cases of chronic fibrotic cavities and one case of infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis with no significant changes in the lesions, the cavities of three patients disappeared, the cavities of two patients were deformed and shrunk, and the lung lesions of the remaining eight patients showed varying degrees of absorption and improvement. No lesions spread or deteriorated in any of the cases. Furthermore, the rate at which tubercle bacilli disappeared from the sputum of patients after treatment with garlic liquid tracheal drip was also very fast. Through the observation of the curative effect of five patients by the Jiaxing Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Institute, tubercle bacilli could no longer be found in the sputum after nine to twenty-eight times of garlic liquid tracheal drip treatment.
    These three traditional Chinese medicines have wide production areas and high yields; are easy to manufacture and low in cost; and are easy to take with few side effects. They are suitable for promotion in rural medical departments.

    黄连素、羊胆、大蒜液
    疗效很好的三种治肺病中药
    据新华社讯　杭州市第二医院用黄连素、浙江临安疗养院用羊胆、嘉兴市结核病防治所用大蒜液（气管滴注）治疗肺结核病人共五十六人，都获得显著效果。据病案纪录分析，这些病人在用这三种中药治疗前和治疗后的爱克斯光摄片对照证明：治疗三个月后结核病人浸润型病灶吸收、好转，结核空洞缩小或消失的达60％—83％。其中除黄连素治疗有一例病灶有播散现象外，其余服用中药后，无一例病灶播散或恶化。在病人的疾病症状方面，百分之百的都有不同程度的改善。浙江临安疗养院用羊胆治疗的二十一个病人的分析，男女病人都有，年龄自二十二岁至四十五岁，都是机关干部，经过长期的住院疗养，其中最长的已有六年多，短的也在三个月以上，都曾口服或注射过较大量的链霉素、异烟肼等抗痨药物，其中四例还曾配合采用肺萎陷疗法而无效的。这二十一个病人在改服羊胆前都经过爱克斯光摄片检查，其中十例是浸润型肺结核，十例是慢纤维性空洞型肺结核一例是亚急性血型播散型肺结核。其中十九个病人在痰中找到结核菌，有二例病人合并气管结核，有十三例病人肺两侧都有病灶，并有十二例病人肺部已有明显的空洞可见。临安疗养院为了观察羊胆对肺结核的确实疗效，事先都停止了原来应用的抗痨药物，改用内服羊胆粉，每日一克。经三个月后爱克斯光复查证明：二十一个病人中，除七例慢性纤维性空洞和一例浸润型肺结核病灶无明显改变外，有三个病人空洞消失，二个病人空洞变形、缩小，其余八个病人肺部病灶都有不同程度的吸收好转，无一例病灶播散或恶化。又如用大蒜液气管滴注治疗后，病人痰中结核菌消失的速度也很快。嘉兴市结核病防治所通过五个病人的疗效观察：经九至二十八次大蒜液气管滴注治疗后，痰内已找不着结核菌了。
    这三种中药，产地广、产量多；制法容易、成本低；服用简便、副作用少。适应于农村医疗部门推广。
