    Xinhua News Agency report: Argentine oil workers are fighting against the seizing of Argentina's oil resources by international oil groups led by the United States.
    Workers of the Argentine National Oil Monopoly Company decided at a meeting on the 9th to hold a strike to protest the oil exploration contracts signed by the government and foreign monopoly capital enterprises.
    The worker representatives attending this meeting represented oil workers from all over Argentina. They demanded the cancellation of contracts recently signed with monopoly enterprises in the United States and European countries. They believe that the right to exploit Argentina's oil should not be given to foreign companies, but should be exclusively owned by the Argentine National Oil Monopoly Company.
    The meeting decided that if the government does not cancel the aforementioned contracts, they will hold a forty-eight hour strike on the 13th. Ten days later, there will be a ninety-six hour strike.
    Prior to this, oil workers in Mendoza Province, Argentina, had been on strike since October 31 to protest the oil exploration contracts signed between Argentina and the United States. (Originally published in the Colombian "El Tiempo")

    反对外国垄断集团的掠夺行为
    阿根廷石油工人决定举行罢工
    据新华社讯　阿根廷的石油工人正在为反对以美国为首的国际石油集团攫取阿根廷的石油资源而斗争。
    阿根廷国家石油专卖公司工人在9日举行的大会上决定举行罢工，抗议政府和外国垄断资本企业签订的开采石油合同。
    参加这次大会的工人代表着阿根廷全国各地的石油工人。他们要求取消不久以前同美国和欧洲国家的垄断企业订立的合同。他们认为，阿根廷的石油开采权不应让给外国公司，而应该由阿根廷国家石油专卖公司所独有。
    大会决定，如果政府不取消上述合同，他们便将在13日举行四十八小时的罢工。十天之后，还要举行一次九十六小时的罢工。
    在此以前，阿根廷门多萨省的石油工人为了抗议阿根廷和美国订立的开采石油的合同，曾经从10月31日起举行罢工。（原载哥伦比亚“时报”）
