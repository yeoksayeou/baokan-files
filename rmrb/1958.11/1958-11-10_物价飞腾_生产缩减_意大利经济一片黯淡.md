Soaring Prices, Reduced Production
Italian Economy in Gloom

    This newspaper reports that the Italian government's economic policies and the impact of the American economic crisis have led to increasingly severe economic difficulties in Italy.

    Since March, Italy's cost of living index has been rising at a rate of approximately 1% per month. In May, Italy's cost of living index was 7% higher than in the same period of 1957. Prices have risen an average of 8% in the last twelve months. Food items such as meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, and wine have seen particularly sharp price increases.

    After World War II, Italy's industrial production generally increased rapidly. In recent years, the average annual growth rate has been 7% to 8%. However, from April 1957 to April 1958, Italy's overall production index decreased by 0.6%, a situation unseen for many years. Production reductions are continuing in certain important industrial sectors such as metallurgy, textiles, and solid fuels. Taking the steel industry as an example, only 4.17 million tons of steel were produced in the first eight months of this year, a decrease of 5.9% compared to the same period last year. And August was down 19.9% from August last year.

    Along with rising prices and production reductions in important industrial sectors, the army of unemployed remains at a peak of more than 1.8 million people. (Attached picture)

    Under the attack of the economic crisis, the lives of the Italian people are becoming increasingly impoverished. Many people have nowhere to live and have to sleep in wooden boxes at night. This is a photograph taken on the streets of Italy by a Hungarian journalist.

    物价飞腾　生产缩减
    意大利经济一片黯淡
    本报讯　意大利政府奉行的经济政策和美国经济危机的影响，使意大利经济困难日趋严重。
    从3月以来，意大利生活费用指数以每月约1％的速度不断上升。5月，意大利生活费用指数比1957年同期增高了7％。在最近十二个月以来，价格平均上涨了8％。其中食品如肉类、鱼、蔬菜、水果和酒的价格上涨得特别厉害。
    第二次世界大战以后，意大利工业生产一直上升较快。最近几年，平均每年增长率为7％到8％。但是从1957年4月到1958年4月，意大利总的生产指数缩减了0.6％，这是多年以来所没有的情况。某些重要工业部门如冶金、纺织、固体燃料等生产缩减还在继续。以钢铁工业来说，今年头八个月生产的钢只有四百一十七万吨，比去年同期减少了5.9％。而8月份比去年8月更减少了19.9％。
    与物价上涨、重要工业部门生产缩减的同时，失业大军仍然保持一百八十多万人的最高纪录。（附图片）
    在经济危机的袭击下，意大利人民的生活日益贫困，很多人无处住宿，夜来只得睡在木箱子里。这是匈牙利记者在意大利街头所摄的一张相片。
