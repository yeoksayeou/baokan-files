Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace today sent a telegram to the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, warmly endorsing and supporting the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament's call to the people of all countries to launch an "International Joint Action Month" to stop nuclear testing, ban nuclear weapons, achieve universal disarmament, respect the independence of all countries, and eliminate the threat of war. The telegram reads as follows:

To the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs:

The Chinese people express warm endorsement and support for the call issued by the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, held in Tokyo in August this year, to the people of all countries to launch an "International Joint Action Month" to stop nuclear testing, ban nuclear weapons, achieve universal disarmament, respect the independence of all countries, and eliminate the threat of war.

Recently, people from all walks of life in Japan have launched a massive struggle across the country against nuclear weapons, demanding that the United States withdraw all its armed forces from Japan and abolish all military bases on Japanese territory, and opposing Nobusuke Kishi's revival of Japanese militarism and the transportation of nuclear weapons under the guise of so-called revision of the "Japan-US Security Treaty." A series of conspiracies between US imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government have turned Japan into a forward position for the United States to wage atomic aggression, placing the Japanese nation on the brink of atomic war and destruction, and seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. The Japanese people's struggle against US imperialist aggression and the resurgence of Japanese militarism is not only in line with the vital interests of the Japanese people, but also with the common interests of defending peace in the Far East and the world.

The Chinese people fully sympathize with and firmly support this just struggle of the Japanese people. The Chinese people express their heartfelt respect to the Japanese people who are standing up to fight more and more widely and strongly. We wish the Japanese people's struggle continuous new achievements. We are deeply convinced that as long as the Japanese people further strengthen unity and cooperation and carry out a heroic and unyielding struggle, they will surely win the final victory!

The Chinese people have consistently waged unremitting struggles for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the achievement of universal disarmament, for opposing imperialist aggression and defending world peace. Recently, the Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from Korea, which is another new effort by the Chinese people to promote the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.

The governments of the United States and Britain, disregarding the firm protests and opposition of the people of the world, continue to insist on large-scale nuclear tests and reject the new and reasonable proposal recently put forward by the Soviet government to immediately and permanently cease nuclear tests. At present, the US military not only does not withdraw from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the Taiwan Strait, as well as other parts of the world, but also continues to expand military bases everywhere, constantly transporting various nuclear weapons into other countries, and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and engaging in subversive activities everywhere, continuing to pursue a policy of aggressive war and seriously threatening world peace. While interfering in our country's internal affairs and carrying out war threats and military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area, the United States is stepping up its conspiracy to create "two Chinas,"妄想to achieve the goal of permanently occupying our territory of Taiwan and侵略our country. The Chinese people will never allow the US conspiracy to succeed. Any conspiracy to interfere in China's internal affairs and create "two Chinas" is bound to be completely defeated. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. The US aggressors must get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.

The Chinese people are willing to further strengthen unity with the people of Japan and the world who love peace, to strive for the immediate and permanent cessation of all nuclear tests and the early realization of universal disarmament, and to jointly struggle against imperialist aggression and defend world peace.

    反对美帝国主义侵略和日本军国主义复活
    中国人民支持日本人民正义斗争
    我和大致电日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会
    新华社15日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会今天致电日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会，热烈赞同和支持第四届禁止原子弹、氢弹与争取裁军世界大会向各国人民发出的关于为停止核试验、禁止核武器、普遍裁军、尊重各国的独立和消除战争威胁而展开“国际共同行动月”的号召。电文如下：
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会：
    中国人民对于今年8月在东京召开的第四届禁止原子弹、氢弹与争取裁军世界大会向各国人民发出的关于为停止核试验、禁止核武器、普遍裁军、尊重各国的独立和消除战争威胁而展开“国际共同行动月”的号召，表示热烈的赞同和支持。
    日本各阶层人民最近在全国各地展开了声势浩大的反对核武器、要求美国从日本撤走一切武装部队和从日本领土撤消一切军事基地、反对岸信介在所谓修改“日美安全条约”的名义下复活日本军国主义和运进核武器的广泛斗争。美帝国主义和岸信介政府相互勾结进行的一系列阴谋，已把日本变成美国进行原子侵略战争的前哨阵地，使日本民族面临原子战争的边缘和毁灭的危险，并严重地威胁着远东和世界的和平。日本人民反对美帝国主义侵略和日本军国主义再起的斗争，不仅符合日本人民的切身利益，而且符合保卫远东和世界和平的共同利益。
    中国人民完全同情和坚决支持日本人民的这一正义斗争。中国人民对愈益广泛和坚强地站起来斗争的日本人民，表示衷心的敬意。我们祝日本人民的斗争不断取得新的成就。我们深信，只要日本人民进一步加强团结合作和进行英勇不屈的斗争，就一定会获得最后的胜利！
    中国人民一贯为禁止核武器和争取普遍裁军，为反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平而进行不懈的斗争。最近，中国人民志愿军已经全部撤离朝鲜，这是中国人民对于促进远东和世界和平事业的又一新的努力。
    美、英两国政府不顾全世界人民的坚决抗议和反对，仍继续坚持大规模核试验，拒绝最近苏联政府所提出的立即和永远停止核试验的新的合理建议。目前，美国军队不仅不从南朝鲜、日本、台湾和台湾海峡以及世界其他地方撤出，反而到处扩建军事基地，不断把各种核武器运进其他国家，并到处干涉别国内政和从事颠覆活动，继续推行侵略战争政策，严重威胁世界和平。美国在台湾海峡地区干涉我国内政和进行战争威胁与军事挑衅的同时，正加紧制造“两个中国”的阴谋，妄想达到永远霸占我国领土台湾和侵略我国的目的。中国人民决不容许美国的阴谋得逞。任何干涉中国内政和制造“两个中国”的阴谋都一定要遭到彻底失败。中国人民一定要解放台湾，澎湖、金门和马祖。美国侵略者必须从台湾和台湾海峡滚出去。
    中国人民愿同日本和全世界爱好和平的人民进一步加强团结，为争取立即和永远停止一切核试验和早日实现普遍裁军，为反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平而共同奋斗。
