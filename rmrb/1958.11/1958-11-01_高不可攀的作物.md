Towering Crops

    At the exhibition hall, there were several tall and large crops that could reach the ceiling in an ordinary house. In the lobby of the Comprehensive Hall, there were two pots of jute transplanted from afar, each stalk as tall as fifteen feet. It came from Hunan Province and was an exhibit of Nanxian Middle School, with a yield of 2,500 to 3,000 jin per mu. Leaning against the wall was a cluster of sorghum, with red tassels at the top of stalks that were more than thirteen feet tall. Looking at its base, the nineteen stalks originally grew from three roots, that is, three sorghum plants grew a total of nineteen tassels, one with seven tassels, and the other two with six tassels each. This was an exhibit sent by cadres from Hebei Agricultural University, called multi-tassel giant sorghum. In the Henan Pavilion, there were several tall tobacco plants. One plant from Henan Agricultural College was fifteen feet tall and grew one hundred and twenty-five large leaves; another tobacco plant from Hongzhuan University in Daokou Township, Shangqiu County, was also fifteen feet tall.

    高不可攀的作物
    在展览馆，有几种又高又大的农作物，放在一般房子里可以顶到屋顶。在综合馆的大厅，有两盆远道移植来的黄麻，每株足有一丈五尺高。它来自湖南省，是南县中学的展品，一亩要产二千五百到三千斤。靠墙立着一丛高粱，红色穗子长在一丈三尺多高的秆子顶尖。再看它的根部，十九根秆子原来长在三个根子上，也就是说三棵高粱一共长了十九穗，一棵七穗，另两棵各六穗。这是河北农业大学下放干部送来的展品，称为多穗大高粱。在河南馆，有几株高大的烟，河南农学院的一株高一丈五尺，长了一百二十五片大叶；另外商丘县道口乡红专大学的烟也有一丈五尺。
