Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    The "Berliner Zeitung" of the German Democratic Republic recently published a survey report on the economic situation of the German Democratic Republic. The report stated: "The German Democratic Republic is an industrial power with world influence." Its economic growth rate has exceeded that of all capitalist countries, and its industrial output already ranks fifth in Europe.
    The report pointed out that although the industrial production of the German Democratic Republic has encountered many difficulties due to the division of Germany, its industrial output in 1955 more than doubled that of 1936. During the third five-year plan period (1960-1965), industrial output will increase by at least 50%.
    The survey report stated: "Our products in machine manufacturing, electrical technology, precision instruments, and optical industries have all reached international standards and have received attention and praise from experts at all international fairs and exhibitions. Today, large factories with complete sets of equipment provided by the German Democratic Republic are in production in many countries. Our industry provides the equipment needed by various hospitals and research institutes."
    From the survey report, it can be seen that the light industrial products of the German Democratic Republic also occupy a considerable position in the international market.

    据新华社讯　民主德国“柏林日报”最近发表了一份关于民主德国经济情况的调查报告。报告说：“德意志民主共和国是具有世界影响的工业大国。”它的经济增长速度已经超过所有资本主义国家，工业产品产量已经占欧洲的第五位。
    报告指出，尽管民主德国的工业生产因德国的分裂而碰到许多困难，但是它在1955年的工业产量还是超过1936年一倍以上，在第三个五年计划期间（1960年—1965年），工业产量至少将增加50％。
    调查报告说：“我们的机器制造、电力技术、精密仪器和光学工业的各项产品都达到了国际水平，在所有的国际博览会和展览会上受到专家们的注意和赞扬。今天，在许多国家里由民主德国提供成套设备的大型工厂正在进行生产。我们的工业提供了各科医院和研究院需要的装备。”
