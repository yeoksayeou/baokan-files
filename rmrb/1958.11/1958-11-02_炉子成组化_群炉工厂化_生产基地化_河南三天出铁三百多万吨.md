Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 1st. The red flag of continuous high steel production in Henan Province is raised higher and higher, and the satellites launched are getting bigger and bigger. On October 29th, the province produced 1,056,747 tons of iron and 11,704 tons of steel. On the 30th, the province's steel production greatly exceeded the production level of the 29th. On this day, the province produced a total of 1,333,808 tons of iron and 100,2973 tons of steel. On the 31st, although the province's steel production decreased compared to the 30th, it still maintained a high record of 74,181 tons of steel and 883,703 tons of iron per day. The quality of steel has also improved compared to the past. Before reporting the daily iron production to the higher authorities, various regions have classified good iron and second-class iron that can be directly used for steelmaking according to the national quality standards, and removed sintered iron that cannot be used for steelmaking.

On the 29th and 30th, Xinxiang and Xuchang Special Zones had the highest steel production in the province. On the 29th, Xuchang Special Zone produced 500,6848 tons of iron and 6,374 tons of steel, leading the province. However, on the 30th, Xinxiang Special Zone produced 1,225,959 tons of iron and 55,589 tons of steel, exceeding Xuchang Special Zone. Many counties and collaboration zones in the province have achieved excellent results in these two days. On the 29th, three counties and collaboration zones in the province produced more than 100,000 tons of steel per day. The Bo'ai-Wenxian collaboration zone produced 339,906 tons of iron and 20 tons of steel; Yuxian County produced 300,7467 tons of iron and 6,020 tons of steel; and Lushan County produced 157,778 tons of iron. On this day, there were also seven counties and collaboration zones with a daily steel production of more than 10,000 tons and less than 100,000 tons. By the 30th, three more counties and collaboration zones in the province had produced more than 100,000 tons of steel per day. The Jiyuan-Mengxian collaboration zone produced 396,250 tons of iron and 106 tons of steel; Anyang County produced 329,000 tons of iron and 5,000 tons of steel; and Wuzhi County produced 185,000 tons of iron and 3,030 tons of steel. On this day, there were also seventeen counties and collaboration zones with a daily steel production of more than 10,000 tons and less than 100,000 tons.

Henan Province's continuous three-day large-scale and high-yield steel production was achieved under the following circumstances: A comprehensive Great Leap Forward centered on steel has emerged throughout the province. Mining, coal mining, and transportation have continuously launched many high-yield satellites, providing a large amount of reserves of raw materials and fuels needed for steel production. On the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, various regions have organized various professional teams through the experience of the masses themselves, established certain management systems, and begun to implement furnace grouping, mass furnace factory production, and production base construction. The broad masses, through improving furnace types, improving equipment, and improving operating methods, have carried out technological innovations, improved labor efficiency, and saved labor. The red flag competition is in full swing in various places. Through the red flag competition, the communist ideology of the broad masses has been greatly improved, and the cooperative relationship between various parties has been strengthened.

The steel army in the province has more than 6.7 million people participating every day. After sowing wheat, many counties organized thousands upon thousands of new recruits to go to the mountains. Various iron smelting furnaces put into production in various places have reached more than 400,000. Some counties have also followed the example of Luzhai County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and used porcelain kilns, lime kilns, and blockhouses to smelt iron. (Attached picture)

    炉子成组化　群炉工厂化　生产基地化
    河南三天出铁三百多万吨
    新华社郑州1日电　河南省钢铁连续高产的红旗越举越高，卫星越放越大。10月29日，全省产生铁一百零五万六千七百四十七吨，产钢一万一千七百零四吨；30日，全省的钢铁产量又大大突破了29日的生产水平。这天全省共产生铁一百三十三万三千八百零八吨，产钢十万零二千九百七十三吨。31日，全省钢铁产量虽较30日下降，但仍保持日产钢七万四千一百八十一吨，铁八十八万三千七百零三吨的高额纪录。钢铁质量也比过去有所提高。各地在向上级报告当日铁的产量以前，都根据国家规定的质量标准，分出了好铁和能够直接炼钢的二类铁，剔出了不能炼钢的烧结铁。
    在29、30日两天中，全省钢铁产量最高的是新乡、许昌两个专区。29日，许昌专区产铁五十万零六千八百四十八吨，钢六千三百七十四吨，在全省领先；可是在30日，新乡专区产铁一百二十二万五千九百五十九吨，产钢五万五千五百八十九吨，超过了许昌专区。全省有不少县和协作区，在这两天里都创造出优异的成绩。29日，全省出现了三个日产钢铁十万吨以上的县和协作区，博（爱）温（县）协作区，产铁三十三万九千九百零六吨，钢二十吨；禹县产铁三十万零七千四百六十七吨，钢六千零二十吨；鲁山县产铁十五万七千七百七十八吨。这天还有七个日产钢铁一万吨以上、十万吨以下的县和协作区。到30日，全省又出现了三个日产钢铁十万吨以上的县和协作区。济（源）孟（县）协作区，产铁三十九万六千二百五十吨，钢一百零六吨；安阳县产铁三十二万九千吨，钢五千吨；武陟县产铁十八万五千吨，钢三千零三十吨。这天还出现了十七个日产钢铁一万吨以上、十万吨以下的县和协作区。
    河南省连续三天的钢铁大面积高额丰产，是在这样的情况下产生的：全省以钢铁为中心出现了全面大跃进，采矿、挖煤、交通运输连续放出很多高产卫星，使钢铁生产所需的原料、燃料有了大量的储备。各地在充分发动群众的基础上，通过群众本身的经验组织了各种专业队，建立了一定的管理制度，开始实行了炉子成组化、群炉工厂化、生产基地化。广大群众通过改进炉型、改进设备、改进操作方法，进行了技术革新，提高了劳动效率，节省了劳动力。红旗竞赛在各地开展得热火朝天。通过红旗竞赛，大大地提高了广大群众的共产主义思想，密切了各个方面的协作关系。
    全省上阵的钢铁大军，每天有六百七十多万人。不少县在种完小麦以后，就组织了成千上万的生力军上山。各地投入生产的各种炼铁炉，已达四十多万座。有的县并仿效广西僮族自治区鹿寨县的办法，用瓷窑、石灰窑、炮楼来炼铁。（附图片）
