Singing of the Bumper Cotton Harvest
    Silver peaches strung together

    Silver peaches are strung all around,
    A boundless sea of snow connecting earth and sky;
    Girls find it hard to pick the cotton,
    Keeping company with Chang'e at night,
    Cotton piles are higher than mountains,
    Large and small warehouses cannot hold it all;
    Reporting victory before Tiananmen,
    Thanks to the Party's good leadership.
    The East Wind Brings Joy

    In the eighth month, osmanthus fragrance fills the air,
    Bumper cotton crops are on the market again,
    Endless cotton fields gleam with silver,
    Many thanks to the east wind for bringing joy.

    歌唱棉花大丰收
    银桃串连串
    遍地银桃串连串，
    雪海无边地连天；
    姑娘摘棉作了难，
    夜与嫦娥来作伴，
    棉花堆堆比山高，
    大小仓库装不了；
    天安门前献捷报，
    感谢党的好领导。
    东风送喜来
    八月里来桂花香，
    丰产棉花又登场，
    无际棉地闪银彩，
    多谢东风送喜来。
