Xinhua News Agency, November 27th dispatch from New York: The "New York Times" on the 23rd, in an article titled "Latin America and the United States," admitted that Latin American countries are very dissatisfied with the United States' policy of economic plunder, which has seriously damaged Latin American economies.

The article pointed out that many Latin American countries rely heavily on world market prices for one or two commodities to sustain their economies. Therefore, if they want to industrialize, they must have "stable prices and capital for investment."

However, the article continued, "the situation in the North often harms them." After listing the continuous decline in wool and coffee prices and the United States' intensified restrictions on imports of oil and lead-zinc, the article said that these practices have caused economic difficulties for those "countries whose main income relies on one or more of these products." The article pointed out that many Latin American countries are dissatisfied with the United States' above-mentioned trade discrimination policies. They complain that the United States "doesn't pay attention to its closest neighbors."

The article concluded by saying that Latin American countries' dissatisfaction with American economic plunder had already erupted in May of this year when U.S. Vice President Nixon was making a "goodwill" visit to Latin America. The scene of Latin American people spitting on and throwing stones at the American envoy at that time "shocked Washington."

    “纽约时报”承认
    美国经济掠夺害人不浅  拉丁美洲国家十分不满
    新华社27日讯　纽约消息：23日的“纽约时报”在题为“拉丁美洲和美国”的一篇文章中承认，拉丁美洲国家对美国的经济掠夺政策感到非常不满，它使拉丁美洲的经济遭到严重破坏。
    这篇文章指出，拉丁美洲许多国家是在很大程度上依赖一两种商品的世界市场价格来维持它们的经济的。因此，如果它们想要实行工业化，就必需有“稳定的价格和用于投资的资本”。
    但是，文章接着说“北部的情况常常使它们受到损害”。文章列举了羊毛和咖啡价格的不断下降和美国加紧限制石油和铅锌的进口这些事实以后说，这些作法给那些“大部分收入依靠一种或多种这样的产品的国家造成了经济困难。”文章指出，许多拉丁美洲国家对美国的上述贸易歧视政策是不满的。它们埋怨美国“不把它最靠近的一些邻国放在眼里”。
    文章最后说，拉丁美洲国家对美国的经济掠夺的不满早在今年5月当美国副总统尼克松在拉丁美洲进行“亲善”访问时就爆发出来。拉丁美洲人民当时向美国的使者吐唾沫和投掷石块的情景“使华盛顿感到震惊”。
