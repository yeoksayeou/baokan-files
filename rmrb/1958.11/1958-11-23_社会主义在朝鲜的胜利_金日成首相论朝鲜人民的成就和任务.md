Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 22nd. "Izvestia" published an article by Premier Kim Il Sung on the 19th, entitled "The Victory of Socialism in Korea." This article discusses the great achievements of the Korean people in socialist construction, as well as the current tasks of socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward situation in northern Korea.

He said that our most important task at present is to rely on socialist relations of production to realize the technological transformation and cultural revolution of the national economy. In this way, industrial and agricultural production must be raised to a new and higher level to further accelerate socialist construction.

Kim Il Sung wrote: Based on the achievements already made, our party has formulated a grand program, that is, within the next six or seven years, the output of major industrial products should reach the following levels: more than 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 25 million tons of coal, 4 million tons of pig iron and granulated iron, 3 million to 3.5 million tons of steel, 1.5 million to 2 million tons of chemical fertilizers, 5 million tons of cement, 500 million meters of cloth, and 1 million tons of fish; in agriculture, it is stipulated that more than 7 million tons of grain should be produced.

"This means that the various sectors of the national economy should reach a level several times higher than now in the next few years."

"Achieving these indicators will turn our formerly backward country into a developed socialist industrial country and will fundamentally improve the material and cultural life of the people."

The article said: "The completion of this program will lay a solid material foundation for the peaceful reunification of our motherland, the restoration of the devastated South Korean economy, and the improvement of the lives of the bankrupt South Korean residents."

"Great goals generate great enthusiasm. The heroic working class and all the working people of our country, responding to the call of the Party, have decided to complete the first Five-Year Plan one and a half years ahead of schedule and to realize the great tasks now put forward in four or five years instead of six or seven years."

He also said that the broad masses of working people regard the Party's policies as their own cause. Having undergone the test of struggle, they are now showing unparalleled enthusiasm. "'Leap forward to socialism at the speed of a thousand-mile horse!' This slogan vividly reflects the unprecedented upsurge of creativity among workers, peasants and intellectuals."

The article said that under the current conditions in our country, in order to achieve a high tide in the entire national economy, the most important thing is to rapidly develop the production of electricity, metals, and machinery, and to drastically increase grain production.

He said that at present, work to transform nature is being carried out more and more widely in rural areas, so that within the next two or three years, more than 70% of the paddy fields and dry land, which account for the total cultivated land, will be guaranteed to have adequate irrigation systems.

The article said that experience shows that it is of great significance to give full play to local initiative in socialist construction. Recently, our party has taken some measures to simultaneously develop large, medium and small industrial enterprises, and in addition to adopting modern technology in the production of daily necessities and building materials, we must also make extensive use of local handicrafts. Our local workers and working masses have built hundreds of small factories in accordance with the Party's line, using local raw materials, materials, and idle labor to start mass production of various daily necessities and building materials. According to preliminary statistics, in 1959, the output of local industry will be more than half that of the enterprises under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Light Industry. Mobilizing these new potentials will enable us to more fully meet the needs of the people and greatly accelerate the development of the national economy.

The article said: Now the employees of various enterprises are promoting the mechanization and automation of the production process, and widely adopting advanced production methods. The whole country is now involved in the wave of innovation. It is very valuable that it is not individual workers who are the initiators of innovation, but the entire collective. This shows that our working class is creating new norms of socialist labor every day, which marks a major turning point in our country's technological revolution.

He also pointed out that with the rapid development of the national economy, the cultural revolution is also proceeding rapidly.

Comrade Kim Il Sung finally said that the achievements of the Korean people in socialist construction are inseparable from the support and assistance of our friends and fraternal countries, especially the Soviet people. We are proud that the Korean people are fighting for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and for building socialism. They are firmly defending the eastern outpost of the socialist camp and contributing to our common cause of peace and socialism.

    社会主义在朝鲜的胜利
    金日成首相论朝鲜人民的成就和任务
    新华社莫斯科22日电　“消息报”19日刊载了金日成首相写的题为“社会主义在朝鲜的胜利”的文章。这篇文章论述了朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就，以及当前社会主义建设的任务和朝鲜北部的大跃进形势。
    他说，目前我们的最主要的任务是依靠社会主义的生产关系，实现国民经济的技术改造和文化革命。这样，必须把工业和农业生产提到新的、更高的水平，进一步加速社会主义的建设。
    金日成写道：我们党根据已经取得的成就，制定了宏伟的纲领，即在最近六、七年之内要使主要工业产品的产量达到如下的水平：电力二百多亿度，煤二千五百万吨，生铁和粒铁四百万吨，钢三百万至三百五十万吨，化学肥料一百五十万至二百万吨，水泥五百万吨，布匹五亿公尺，鱼一百万吨；在农业方面，规定要生产粮食七百多万吨。
    “这意味着，国民经济各部门在最近几年之内应该达到比现在高几倍的水平。”
    “达到这些指标，就会使我们这个过去落后的国家变成发达的社会主义工业国，并且将从根本上改善人民的物质和文化生活。”
    文章说：“这个纲领的完成，将为和平统一我们的祖国、恢复遭到破坏的南朝鲜的经济和改善破产的南朝鲜居民的生活打下强大的物质基础。”
    “伟大的目标产生伟大的干劲。英勇的工人阶级和我国全体劳动人民响应党的号召，决定提前一年半完成第一个五年计划和用四、五年而不是六、七年的时间实现现在提出的伟大任务。”
    他还说，劳动人民群众把党的政策看作自己切身的事业，他们经过了斗争的考验，现在表现了无比的热情。“‘以千里马的速度向社会主义跃进！’这个口号很形象地反映了工人、农民和知识分子的创造力的空前高涨。”
    文章说，在我国现在的条件下，为了取得整个国民经济的高涨，最主要的是迅速发展电力、金属和机器的生产以及急剧提高粮食生产。
    他说，目前在农村中日益广泛地开展着改造大自然的工作，以便在最近两三年内使占全部耕地70％以上的水田和旱田都保证具有充分的灌溉系统。
    文章说，经验表明，在社会主义建设中广泛发挥地方上的主动性具有重大的意义。最近我们党采取了一些措施，使大中小工业企业并举，在生产日用品和建筑材料方面除了采用现代化技术以外，还要广泛利用地方上的手工业。我们的地方工作人员和劳动群众已经根据党的路线建成了数百个小型工厂，利用当地的原料、材料和闲散的劳动力，开始大量生产各种各样的日用品和建筑材料。据初步统计，在1959年地方工业的产量将比轻工业部所辖各企业多一半。动员这些新的潜力就能够更充分地满足人民的需要，并且大大地加快国民经济的发展。
    文章说：现在各企业的职工都在推行生产过程的机械化和自动化，广泛地采用先进的生产方法。全国现在都卷入了革新运动的浪潮。非常宝贵的是：成为革新倡议者的不是个别的工人，而是整个的集体。这说明我们的工人阶级每天都在创造社会主义劳动的新定额，这标志着我国技术革命中的大转变。
    他还指出，随着国民经济的突飞猛进的发展，文化革命也在飞快地进行着。
    金日成同志最后说，朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中的成就同我们的朋友、兄弟国家、首先是苏联人民的支持和援助是分不开的。我们引为自豪的是，朝鲜人民正在为和平统一祖国、为建成社会主义而斗争，他们牢固地捍卫着社会主义阵营的东方前哨，对我们的和平和社会主义的共同事业作出贡献。
