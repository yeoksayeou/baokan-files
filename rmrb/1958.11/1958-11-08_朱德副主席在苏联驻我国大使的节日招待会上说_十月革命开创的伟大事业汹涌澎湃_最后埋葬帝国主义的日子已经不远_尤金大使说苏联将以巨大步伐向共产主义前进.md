Xinhua News Agency, 7th. At the grand reception hosted tonight by Soviet Ambassador to China, Yudin, to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution, more than 500 Chinese and foreign guests celebrated this epoch-making great festival in human history with immense joy, celebrating the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the rock-solid Sino-Soviet friendship.

On the rostrum in the reception hall, the national flags of the Soviet Union and China were hung high, and the hall was filled with flowers and evergreen palm trees. Above the rostrum, a huge red banner with gold characters written in Chinese and Russian shone brightly under the strong lights: "Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship and Cooperation Between the Soviet People and the Chinese People – A Strong Fortress of World Peace!"

Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai attended this grand reception. Also attending tonight's reception were Vice Premiers He Long, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, and Bo Yibo; Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, and Cheng Qian; Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, He Xiangning; Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Zhang Zhizhong; Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Wu Yuzhang; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Wentian; Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, General Yang Yong; Political Commissar, General Wang Ping; and heads of various departments of state organs, people's organizations, and democratic parties; senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, famous people from all walks of life in the capital, and heads of foreign diplomatic missions in China.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said excitedly in his speech at the reception: The great cause initiated by the October Revolution has now gained surging development. Today, socialism has become a powerful world system, forming an invincible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The strength of socialism has gained an overwhelming advantage over the strength of imperialism. The great vitality of Marxism-Leninism and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system have become increasingly apparent with the passage of time.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said: The great October Revolution powerfully impacted the imperialist colonial system, causing the colonial system to increasingly move towards collapse. At present, the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rising like a storm. The development of history will inevitably lead to the final burial of all imperialists in the angry tide of world people striving for social and national liberation, and that day is not far away.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said: Today, the unity and strength of the socialist camp are more consolidated and stronger than ever before. The Communist Parties of various countries have carried out a serious principled struggle against anti-Marxist-Leninist modern revisionism and have achieved great victories. This is of great significance for safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism and promoting the development of the international workers' movement.

Vice Chairman Zhu De emphasized that the Chinese people are not only confident in building socialism and further transitioning to communism in a very short historical period, but also determined to complete the unification of their great motherland. The Chinese people's struggle to safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity is just. Now the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to create new tensions in the Taiwan area has been shamefully bankrupt. In order to realize its long-term ambition to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, the U.S. ruling class is painstakingly plotting to create "two Chinas." However, the Chinese people, including the patriotic soldiers and civilians in the Taiwan area, will never allow this conspiracy of the United States to succeed. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu must return to the embrace of the motherland, and U.S. imperialism must get out of the Taiwan area.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said: The Soviet people have always sympathized with and supported the Chinese people. The Chinese people have received tremendous fraternal assistance from the Soviet people in their revolutionary struggle, in their construction cause, and in their struggle to consolidate the security of their motherland and safeguard world peace. The Chinese people will never forget this internationalist assistance. The friendship formed between the Chinese and Soviet people is unprecedented. This friendship is the strongest and invincible pillar of world peace and the cause of human progress. (Full text of the speech on page 2)

Ambassador Yudin spoke first at the reception. He told the Chinese and foreign guests that the great Soviet Union is now transitioning to a higher stage of social development - communism. He said that the forty-first year of the Soviet Union's construction of socialism marks a new, major, unprecedented development in all aspects of Soviet politics, economy, and culture.

Ambassador Yudin said that the entire Soviet people are now welcoming the 21st Congress of the CPSU. This congress will study and adopt the control figures for the economic development of our country from 1959 to 1965. The completion of the new seven-year plan is a huge step forward towards communism. This makes it possible for our country to catch up with the United States in the production of major products, and therefore this is a decisive dividing line in the economic competition between the two world systems of socialism and capitalism.

Yudin said that the fraternal friendship and unbreakable alliance between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China are a reliable guarantee for the further achievements of peace and the socialist camp countries. He reiterated that the Soviet people unanimously support the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan and angrily condemn the provocative actions of the U.S. imperialists in this region.

The speeches by Vice Chairman Zhu De and Ambassador Yudin were warmly welcomed by the Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception, and long applause continuously vibrated the joyous hall.

At the reception, which was full of festive joy and a warm and friendly atmosphere, Vice Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, Ambassador Yudin, and all Chinese and foreign guests constantly raised their glasses to warmly congratulate the increasing prosperity of the communist cause under the brilliant light of the great October Revolution, to congratulate the invincible and strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to congratulate the unity and growth of the world's peace-loving forces. After the reception, the Azerbaijan State Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Union performed wonderful programs for the guests. Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and others stepped onto the stage after the performance, warmly shook hands with the actors, and presented them with flower baskets. (Attached picture)

    朱德副主席在苏联驻我国大使的节日招待会上说
    十月革命开创的伟大事业汹涌澎湃
    最后埋葬帝国主义的日子已经不远
    尤金大使说苏联将以巨大步伐向共产主义前进
    新华社7日讯　在苏联驻华大使尤金今晚举行的庆祝十月革命四十一周年的盛大招待会上，五百多位中外来宾怀着无比喜悦的心情欢庆这个人类历史上划时代的伟大节日，欢庆以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大团结和中苏友谊的坚如磐石。
    招待会大厅的主席台上高悬着苏中两国国旗，大厅的四周布满了鲜花和常青的棕榈树。在主席台的上方，一幅用中文和俄文写着巨大的红底金字标语，在强烈的灯光照耀下字字放射光彩：“世界和平的强大堡垒——苏联人民和中国人民牢不可破的友谊和合作万岁！”
    朱德副主席和周恩来总理出席了这个盛大的招待会。出席今晚招待会的，有贺龙、陈毅、聂荣臻、薄一波副总理，林伯渠、李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、彭真、程潜副委员长，政协全国委员会副主席何香凝，国防委员会副主席张治中，中苏友好协会总会副会长吴玉章，外交部副部长张闻天，中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将，政治委员王平上将，以及国家机关各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派的负责人，中国人民解放军高级将领，首都社会各界著名人士和各国驻华使节。
    朱德副主席在招待会上讲话时兴奋地说：十月革命所开创的伟大事业，现在已经得到了汹涌澎湃的发展。今天，社会主义已经成为强大的世界体系，形成了一个以苏联为首的不可战胜的社会主义阵营。社会主义的力量对于帝国主义的力量已经占了压倒的优势。马克思列宁主义的伟大生命力和社会主义制度的无比优越性，已经随着时间的推移愈加明显地显示出来。
    朱德副主席说：伟大的十月革命有力地冲击了帝国主义殖民制度。使殖民制度日益走向崩溃。目前，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动正在风起云涌，怒涛澎湃。历史的发展必然将使帝国主义者最后全部葬身于世界人民争取社会解放和民族解放的怒涛中，而且这个日子已经不远了。
    朱德副主席说：今天，社会主义阵营的团结和力量比过去任何时候都更加巩固、更加强大了。各国共产党对反马克思列宁主义的现代修正主义进行了严肃的原则斗争，并且获得了巨大的胜利。这对于捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，促进国际工人运动的发展具有伟大的意义。
    朱德副主席强调说，中国人民不仅有信心在很短的历史时期内建成社会主义和进一步向共产主义过渡，而且有决心完成自己伟大祖国的统一。中国人民维护自己主权和领土完整的斗争是正义的。现在美国帝国主义在台湾地区制造新的紧张局势的阴谋已经可耻地破产了。美国统治者为了实现长期霸占中国领土台湾的野心，正在处心积虑地阴谋制造“两个中国”。但是，中国人民包括台湾地区的爱国军民同胞决不会允许美国的这种阴谋得逞。台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖必须回到祖国的怀抱，美帝国主义必须从台湾地区滚出去。
    朱德副主席说：苏联人民一贯同情和支持中国人民。中国人民无论在革命斗争中、在建设事业中、在巩固自己祖国的安全和维护国际和平的斗争中，都得到苏联人民巨大的兄弟般的援助。对于这种国际主义的援助，中国人民将永志不忘。中苏两国人民所结成的友谊，是史无前例的。这个友谊，是世界和平和人类进步事业的最强大的、不可战胜的支柱。（讲话全文见第二版）
    尤金大使在招待会上首先讲话，他向中外客人们说，现在，伟大的苏联正在过渡到社会发展的更高的阶段——共产主义。他说，苏联建设社会主义的第四十一年，标志着苏联政治、经济和文化等各方面新的重大的空前未有的发展。
    尤金大使说，现在全苏联人民正在迎接苏共第二十一次代表大会。这次大会将要研究和通过1959到1965年我国经济发展的控制数字。新的七年计划的完成，是向共产主义前进的巨大的一步。这就使得我国可以在主要产品的生产方面赶上美国，因此这是社会主义和资本主义两个世界体系在经济比赛中的一个决定性的界线。
    尤金说，苏中两国人民之间的兄弟般的友谊和牢可不破的联盟是和平和社会主义阵营各国获得进一步成就的可靠保证。他重申，苏联人民一致支持中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争，并且愤怒谴责美帝国主义者在这个地区的挑衅行动。（讲话全文见第二版）
    朱德副主席和尤金大使的讲话，受到了出席招待会的中外人士的热烈欢迎，长时间的掌声不断振荡着欢乐的大厅。
    在充满节日欢乐和热烈友好气氛的招待会上，朱副主席、周总理、尤金大使和所有中外来宾，不断地相互举杯，热烈祝贺在伟大十月革命光辉照耀下共产主义事业的日益兴盛，祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义阵营不可战胜的强大团结，祝贺世界爱好和平力量的团结和壮大。招待会结束后，苏联阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团为客人们表演了精彩节目。朱德副主席、周总理等在演出结束后步上舞台，同演员们热烈握手，并且向他们赠送花篮。（附图片）
