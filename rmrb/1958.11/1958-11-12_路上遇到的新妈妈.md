A red bus arrived. An old woman from the long queue boarded the bus, a child in a swaddling blanket crying loudly. The conductor was busy announcing stops and selling tickets, and at the same time, he helped the old woman and covered the blanket with his hand, saying with pity, "The child is hungry and needs milk!" The old woman said anxiously, "Indeed!"

The bus was full, and on this cold day, everyone wanted to catch a ride to get to work on time.

The engine roared, and the child in the blanket cried incessantly.

"The child has no milk, it's so pitiful!"

"Yes! The child's mother went to the factory early in the morning to go up the mountain to mine with everyone. Before leaving, she only said to give the child some milk to get by, and she would be back by evening." The old woman told her neighbor, "This little thing is being difficult, he won't drink milk, I have to take him to his aunt in NanShi to beg for some milk!" As she spoke, the old woman hummed and bounced her leg to coax the child.

Nothing worked, the child just cried, his voice a little hoarse.

"Is there any mother who can give the child some milk?" Someone suggested in the crowd.

Everyone looked at each other, who is the mother?

The sound gradually reached the back seat. A woman wearing glasses, sitting by the corner, said with a flushed face, "Give me the child!"

"Great! Great! There's a mother!" The crowd was filled with joy. Dozens of hands, afraid of dropping gold, passed the little bundle from the front. The little guy had a red face, wide open eyes, tears streaming down his face, a pair of small hands tightly clenched into fists, and two small legs kicking the blanket. The mother with glasses kissed the child, opened her clothes, and put her nipple into the little mouth. Instantly, the crying stopped, and everyone on the bus smiled from the bottom of their hearts.

The bus arrived at another stop, and the little bundle was passed back to the old woman's hands. The old woman held the bundle, got off the bus shakily, and said with a smile as she walked, "Children are so lucky! There are mothers everywhere, and relatives everywhere."

    路上遇到的新妈妈
    陶石
    一辆红色大汽车来了。长串的队伍里的老奶奶颤巍巍地走上车，怀内包被里的孩子哇哇直叫。售票员同志忙着报站、售票，这当儿忙着又搀老人又用手盖拢包被，怜惜地说：“孩子饿了，要吃奶！”老人急促地说：“可不是！”
    车上人满满的，这大冷的天，谁不愿搭趟便车，赶时间上班哩。
    引擎发出吼声，包被里的孩子一声接一声哭着。
    “孩子没奶，怪可怜的！”
    “是啊！一大早孩子妈进厂随大伙上山采矿去了。临走只说给孩子喂点牛奶，对付着，挨傍晚就回来。”老奶奶告诉邻座的人，“这小东西作怪，牛奶他不吃，我得抱他去南市找他姨姨讨口奶！”说着说着，老奶奶哼哼啊啊地颠着腿哄着孩子。
    怎么也不行，孩子只哭，声音有点儿哑。
    “哪位妈妈给孩子喂口奶？”人丛中有人提议。
    大伙儿，你望我，我瞧你，哪位是妈妈呢？
    声音逐渐传到了后座，靠拐角的一位戴眼镜的女同志，泛红着脸说：“把孩子递给我吧！”
    “好了！好了！有妈妈了！”人群尽都喜悦。几十双手都怕掉落了金子似的，小包裹从前头传过来了。小家伙红红的脸，圆睁睁的大眼，眼泪流了个满脸，一双小手紧捏着小拳直划，两条小腿直蹬被子。戴眼镜的妈妈亲亲孩子，解开了怀，乳头塞进小嘴里，顷刻，哭声没有了，车上的人全都自内心发出微笑。
    车又到站，小包裹又传到老奶奶的手，老奶奶搂着包袱，颤巍巍下了车，边走边笑着说：“孩子们可真有福气！处处有妈妈，处处有亲人。”
