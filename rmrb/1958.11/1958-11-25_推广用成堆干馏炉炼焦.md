From the Editor:

    Coal dry distillation in stacks is a good method for enabling small steel plants or small synthetic petroleum plants to develop towards comprehensive utilization. It can not only produce petroleum and other chemical products, but also provide the coke needed for steel production.

    Compared with other indigenous coking methods, stacked batch retorts have many advantages. They have a short coking time (generally only a dozen hours to a day), good coke quality, small lump size, and low loss, making them suitable for use in indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces; they can also recover large amounts of petroleum, ammonium sulfate, gas, and other products, resulting in greater economic benefits.

    Coal is a material that can be comprehensively utilized, but unfortunately, it has not been fully utilized in actual production. Some small oil refineries only produce petroleum or recover ammonium sulfate and gas, while using the produced semi-coke as fuel for civilian use; some small coking plants near iron smelting furnaces only produce coke and do not recover other products. The result is a waste of resources. Using stacked batch retorts for coking can produce both coke and petroleum and other chemical products. It's truly killing many birds with one stone!

    推广用成堆干馏炉炼焦
    煤炭成堆干馏，是使小型钢厂或者小型人造石油厂向综合利用方面发展的一个比较好的方法。它不仅能生产出石油和其他化工产品，还能提供钢铁生产需要的焦炭。
    同其他土炼焦方法比较起来，成堆干馏炉有许多优点。它产焦的时间短（一般只要十几小时到一昼夜），焦炭质量好，块度小，损失少，适合土高炉和小高炉使用；它还可以回收到大量的石油、硫氨、煤气等产品，经济效果较大。
    煤是可以综合利用的物资，可惜目前在实际生产中还没有充分利用。有些小炼油厂，只搞石油或者加收硫氨、煤气，而把生产出的半焦做为民用燃料；一些炼铁炉附近的小炼焦厂，又只搞焦炭，而没有回收其他产品。结果都浪费了资源。采用成堆干馏炉炼焦，既可以生产焦炭，又可以生产石油和其他化工产品。真是一举数得！
