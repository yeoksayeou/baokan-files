    Vietnam Welcomes the Great Leap Forward
    By Wei Zhen, Our Correspondent

    Having healed the wounds of war and restored the pre-war economic level, the Vietnamese people are now at a new starting point, brewing epoch-making changes. Anyone in Hanoi today feels a sense of "a storm is brewing." The Vietnamese friends around me are all raring to go, preparing to welcome a "Dien Bien Phu" battle on the economic and cultural front, so as to greatly change the economic and cultural outlook of Vietnam.

    "American imperialism trampled on the Geneva Accords, occupied our South, thinking that this would overwhelm us; its echoers once clamored that the North is a small and backward place, unable to build anything significant. But after four years of our efforts, they no longer dare to speak, and taking a big step forward will make them tremble even more." A Vietnamese journalist friend told me this. He said, "The Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people inspires us. Our economic and social situation is very similar to that of China. If China can leap forward, we can certainly leap forward too. The vast majority of our comrades have this confidence."

    Indeed, if you visit the various agencies in Hanoi, or travel around the provinces and autonomous regions, you will see that whether in factories, rural areas, schools, or the army, mass meetings are being held everywhere, and people are talking about the Great Leap Forward, talking about how to go all out, build a socialist Vietnam in a faster, better, and more economical way, and severely strike the enemy. "Leap forward, actively prepare conditions for a leap forward." This is the current action slogan of the Vietnamese people. A director of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said: "The heart of leaping forward is boiling in the hearts of the Vietnamese people!"

    Taking agriculture as the main focus to drive the overall work forward in big strides - the Vietnamese Council of Ministers made such a decision at the end of September. Under this policy, a battle plan for "agricultural production this winter and next spring" has been laid out. Based on the experience gained from developing agricultural production this autumn, coupled with the ever-increasing enthusiasm of farmers and the accelerating development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Vietnamese leaders are very confident that the total rice output next year will increase by 50% compared to last year, and more than double the year after. The decisive season for growth is the early rice crop. Because in the past the early rice crop has always had a low yield and a small planting area. Now the Vietnamese government has proposed to make the yield of the early rice fields next spring surpass that of the late rice fields in the past. The planting area will also be greatly expanded. This is a truly national battle. From the inter-zones, provinces, and counties to the various villages and communes (cooperatives), a great debate has been launched everywhere on the planned targets. Is there confidence in completing the average yield target of 2.5 tons per hectare for early rice next spring proposed by the central government? The provinces answered: "Three tons," "Four tons," "Five tons," "Six tons." Some villages proposed average yield targets of: "Ten tons," "Twenty tons," "Twenty-five and a half tons"... Today, no one can know what the final proposed target will be. Conservative thinking is being criticized everywhere. The achievements of experimental fields in Vietnam have made the working people believe: "How much labor you put in, the land will give you how much reward."

    The accelerated development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement is a very important event in North Vietnam today. The target of establishing 200 cooperatives in the whole of North Vietnam this year was far exceeded in Thanh Hoa province alone. This province recently proposed that it will establish and has already started to establish a full thousand cooperatives this year. Before this, Thanh Hoa province only had thirty-two cooperatives. Many provinces reported that the masses are very enthusiastic about establishing cooperatives. Farmers in the Thai-Miao Autonomous Region have spontaneously established more than forty cooperatives.

    The Vietnamese Labor Party and the government have recently repeatedly emphasized that accelerating the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement is the key to developing agricultural production.

    Improving farming techniques has become a craze among the masses. This autumn, 70% of Vietnamese farmers have practiced close planting to varying degrees. Farmers in Thai Binh province used to say: "Sparse planting yields a harvest, close planting leaves the rice bowl empty"; now they say the opposite: "Sparse planting leaves the ground empty, close planting fills the granary." The fertilizer application movement is developing rapidly, causing a fertilizer shortage in North Vietnam for the first time in history this year. In order to universally implement deep plowing, 250,000 "May 1st" plows will be needed next year. The Ministry of Industry has instructed all provinces to be as self-reliant as possible and help local farmers solve the growing need for "May 1st" plows.

    The arrival of the high tide of agricultural development requires other economic sectors to accelerate catching up. To this end, the Ministry of Industry held a conference of local industries in the northern provinces in late October. The representatives believed that although it is difficult to develop local industries on a poor and backward land, as long as we carry forward the spirit of heroic struggle, making do with whatever is available, and boldly inventing and creating, like the workers in the base areas during the anti-French war, then what Chinese workers can do, Vietnamese workers can also do.

    During the preparation for the leap forward, one of the central tasks of the Vietnamese industrial sector is to implement the system of workers participating in enterprise management and cadres participating in labor production.

    The Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, on the one hand, called on the working people to give fuller play to the spirit of being masters of the country, and on the other hand, called on leading cadres to appear as ordinary working people, go deep into the grassroots, and actively participate in physical labor. Central leading cadres all took the lead, digging soil and carrying mud on the water conservancy project sites in Bac Hung Hai and the outskirts of Hanoi. Recently, when President Ho Chi Minh, with his graying hair, inspected the Bac Hung Hai water conservancy project site, he walked fourteen kilometers along the riverbank in one breath.

    Cadres participating in labor has become a trend. Most of the provincial and county party committees are not in the office. Wearing the same clothes and hats as the workers and peasants, one would not know who the party secretary is unless one asked.

    In the new school year after the summer vacation in 1958, the atmosphere in North Vietnamese schools has been completely renewed. Labor glory has become the common understanding of the vast majority of teachers and students, and work-study programs have begun to be implemented. Water conservancy construction sites have become the classrooms for water conservancy students, and going deep into rural areas, factories, and mines to treat the working people has become the graduation exam question for medical students. Overseas Chinese students also want to be all-around athletes in labor. Many students published their feelings in newspapers, saying, "Labor has not only transformed our thinking, but also strengthened our bodies."

    If you ask who is moving the fastest in this battle preparation phase, everyone unanimously agrees that it is the Vietnamese People's Army, and among them, the troops assembled in the North from South Vietnam. A "running forward" movement in military training and labor production is being launched in the People's Army, initiated by a Southern assembly division in Phu Tho province. They have completed their pre-set targets ahead of schedule and above quota in military training and agricultural production, and are currently preparing with the entire army to further launch a Great Leap Forward in troop training and industrial and agricultural production.

    The "Dien Bien Phu" battle on the economic and cultural front is about to be launched first on the agricultural front. Participating in the decisive battle are all the people of North Vietnam. Its momentum is huge and its momentum is soaring, foreshadowing that more than 13 million people will accelerate their advance with the force of a landslide and the power of the sea. Let American imperialism and its running dogs in South Vietnam tremble. (Attached picture)

    越南迎接大跃进
    本报记者　韦真
    越南人民在医好战争创伤、恢复了战前经济水平之后，今天，又在一个新的起点上，酝酿着划时代的变化。处身于今日河内的人，都有一种“山雨欲来”之感。周围的越南朋友们，个个磨拳擦掌，准备着迎接一场经济文化战线上的“奠边府”战斗，使越南的经济文化面貌大大改观。
    “美帝国主义践踏日内瓦协议，窃据我国南方，以为这样就能够压得我们翻不过身；它的应声虫曾经叫嚷说：北方弹丸之区，又穷又落后，建设不出什么名堂来。但经过我们四年的努力，他们已不敢吭声了，再大大前进一步，还得叫他们发抖。”一位越南新闻界朋友这样对我说。他说：“中国人民的大跃进，鼓舞着我们。我国的经济社会情况，同中国很相近，中国能够跃进，我们也一定能够跃进，我们的绝大多数同志都有这种信心。”
    的确，假如你到河内各机关去走一趟，或者到各省、自治区去转一转，你就会看到，无论在工厂、农村、学校或者在部队里，到处都在召开群英会，到处人们都在谈论大跃进，谈论如何鼓足干劲，多快好省地建设社会主义的越南北方，来狠狠地打击敌人。“跃进，积极准备条件跃进。”这是当前越南人民的行动口号。农林部一位司长说：“跃进之心，已在越南人民胸中沸腾！”
    以农业为主来带动全盘工作大步前进——9月底召开的越南部长会议作了这样的决定。在这个方针之下，一场“今冬明春农业生产”的战役计划已经布置下去。根据今秋发展农业生产所取得的经验，加上农民的干劲越来越高和互助合作运动正在加速发展等因素，越南的领导同志对明年稻子总产量比去年增长50％，后年增长一倍以上，都很有信心。增长的决定性的一季就是早造。因为早造过去一向产量很低，而且播种面积不大。现在越南政府提出要使明年早造田产量胜过以前的晚造田。播种面积也要大大扩充。这是一场名副其实的全民性战役。从联区、省、县到各个乡、社（合作社），到处对计划指标展开了大辩论。有没有信心完成中央提出的明春早稻单位面积产量平均每公顷二点五吨呢？各省回答的是：“三吨”、“四吨”、“五吨”、“六吨”。有的乡提出的平均产量指标是：“十吨”、“二十吨”、“二十五吨半”……。今天，还没有一个人能够知道，最后提出的指标是多少吨。保守思想到处受到批判。试验田在越南的成就，使劳动人民相信了：“你付出多少劳力，土地就会给你多少报酬。”
    互助合作运动的开始加速发展，是当前越南北方的一个极为重大的事件。今年内全北越原订要成立二百个合作社的指标，单在清化一个省就被远远突破了。这个省最近提出今年内要成立并且已经着手在成立的合作社，就有整整一千个。在这以前，清化省只有三十二个合作社。许多省份都报告说，群众搞合作社的情绪很高。傣苗自治区农民自发搞起来的合作社，就有四十多个。
    越南劳动党和政府最近反复强调：加速发展互助合作运动，是发展农业生产的关键。
    改进耕作技术已经在群众中形成热潮。今秋越南已有70％的农民在不同程度上实行密植。太平省的农民过去说：“稀植有收成，密植饭碗空”；现在他们反过来说：“稀植地面空，密植谷满仓”。施肥运动正迅速发展，使越南北方今年在历史上第一次发生肥料不足现象。为了普遍实行深耕，明年需要的“五·一”犁将达二十五万部。工业部已责成各省尽量自力更生，帮助当地农民解决日益增长的对“五·一”犁的需要。
    农业发展高潮的到来，要求其它经济部门加速赶上。工业部为此在10月下旬开了一个北方各省地方工业会议。代表们认为，在一穷二白的土地上发展地方工业固然有困难，但只要发扬抗法战争时期根据地工人英勇奋斗、因陋就简、大胆发明创造的精神，那么，中国工人所能够做到的事情，越南工人也一定能够做到。
    在准备跃进期间，越南工业部门当前的中心工作之一，是实行工人参加企业管理和干部参加劳动生产的制度。
    劳动党和胡志明主席一方面号召劳动人民更高地发挥国家主人翁的精神，另方面，号召领导干部以普通劳动人民的姿态出现，深入下层，积极参加体力劳动。中央领导干部个个以身作则，在北兴海和河内近郊的水利工程工地上挖土挑泥。鬓发苍苍的胡志明主席最近视察北兴海水利工程工地的时候，沿着河堤一口气走了十四公里。
    干部参加劳动已经成为风气。省委、县委大部分时间不在办公室里。从头到脚穿的戴的都同工农一样，不问不知道哪一位是党委书记。
    1958年暑假后的新学年，北越学校的风气焕然一新。劳动光荣已经成为绝大部分师生的共同认识，勤工俭学已经开始实行。水利工地成了大学水利系学生的课堂，深入农村、厂矿为劳动人民治病成了医科学生的毕业考题。华侨学生们在劳动中也个个想当健将。许多学生在报纸上发表感想说，“劳动既改造了思想，又锻炼了身体”。
    如果要问在这战役准备阶段当中谁走得最快，大家一致公认要算越南人民军，其中又要算从南越集结到北方来的部队。在军事训练和劳动生产上的“跑步前进”运动正在人民军中展开，发起的是在富寿省的一个南方集结师。他们在军训和农业生产上纷纷提前超额完成预订指标，目前正在同全军一起准备着在部队训练和工农业生产方面进一步掀起大跃进。
    经济文化战线上的“奠边府”战斗，就要首先在农业战线上打响了。参加决战的是全北越的人民。它的声势浩大、气势冲天，预告着一千三百多万人民将以排山倒海之势加速前进。让美帝国主义和它在南越的走狗们去发抖罢。（附图片）
