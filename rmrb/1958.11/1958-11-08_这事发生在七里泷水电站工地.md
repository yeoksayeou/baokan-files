    This Happened at the Qilongxi Hydroelectric Station Construction Site
    Xin'an River Hydroelectric Station, Fu Geng
    It’s a cold autumn night, eleven o'clock deep, the expert meeting is lively. The white house on the steep slope is the meeting place, the oil lamp flickers in the strong wind. A design drawing is spread on the table, two brotherly countries are in talks. The Soviet expert frowns tightly, his sparse silver hair shiny. The expert points to outside the window, a dark expanse of virgin mountains –
    “Design completed and construction started in four months, indigenous methods used for a year of success;"
    "To generate 350,000 kilowatts of electricity, never seen in world history."
    "Every mountain has trees, every water has waves, the drive of China and the Soviet Union is equally strong."
    "Just like your great launching of satellites, China is leaping forward everywhere."
    "Rice yields over 130,000 catties per mu, agronomists go to the fields to rewrite textbooks."
    "Isn't the commune an innovation, integrating workers and peasants, urban and rural areas."
    "Small blast furnaces light up everywhere, molten iron knocks down Britain and the United States."
    "Apprentices are also engaged in inventions, countless indigenous experts."
    "A 5,000-ton ship launches in three months, we don't count it as fast if we release it in a year."
    "Marshals are leading the leap, how can pioneers take one step and hesitate three times?"
    Fresh words are spoken endlessly, the expert playfully pushes down his reading glasses –
    “Next year is the tenth anniversary of National Day, I must come to participate in the power generation ceremony!”
    “There is only one difficulty, hydroelectric stations are built all over the country,"
    "Turbine factories are still too few, generators may not be allocated."
    "Novosibirsk has two units, share half and half with Chinese brothers!"
    Several big hands clasped together, a huge fist lands on the table.
    "One lotus root has two branches, Sino-Soviet friendship is unprecedented."
    "Friendship does not begin in sunny days, but together dispels storms;"
    "Leap forward rockets travel the same road again, raising the red flag of communism high!"
    The clock on the wall strikes twelve, mountains inside and outside welcome a new day. Next year's National Day salute will boom, the electric light of Qilongxi will speak to the world.
      October 1958, on the banks of the Xin'an River

    这事发生在七里泷水电站工地
    新安江水电站　福庚秋寒夜深十一点，专家会议开得欢。陡坡上的白屋是会场，大风吹来油灯晃。一张设计图桌上摊，两国兄弟在会谈。苏联专家紧锁眉头，银发稀疏光油油。专家指指窗外边，黑黝黝一片原始山——“四个月设计就开工，土法上马一年成功；“要发三十五万瓩电，世界史上没瞧见。”“山山有树水水有波，中苏的干劲一般多。“正像你们大发卫星，中国遍地在跃进。“稻子一亩十三万多，农学家下地重编教课书。“公社难道不是创举，工农、城乡融成一体。“小高炉到处点火把，铁水冲倒英美法。“徒工也在搞发明，土法专家数不赢。“五千吨大船三月下海，咱一年放光不算快。“元帅领头在飞跃，先行官怎能一步三摇？”新鲜话儿吐不尽，专家俏皮地推低老花眼镜——“明年国庆十周年，我一定来参加发电大典！”“只是一桩有困难，五湖四海造电站，“涡轮机厂还太少，发电机可能分不到。”“新西伯利亚有两台，和中国弟兄对半开！”几双大手握一道，巨大的拳头落上桌。“一条莲根两个枝，中苏友谊史无前例。”“友情不从晴朗的日子开始，一起驱散过暴风雨；“跃进火箭再同路，把共产主义的红旗高举！”壁上钟敲十二点，山里山外迎接新的一天。明年国庆礼炮轰天，七里泷的电光要向世界发言。
