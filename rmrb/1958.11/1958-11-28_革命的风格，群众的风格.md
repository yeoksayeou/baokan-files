    Revolutionary Style, Style of the Masses
    Xiao He
    The audience in the capital welcomed the performance of the Erich Weinert Ensemble of the People's Army of the German Democratic Republic with warm and excited feelings. Every program of the Ensemble, with its exciting performance, merged with the emotions of the audience. "Revolutionary style, style of the masses" became the common language for the audience to praise the performance. People deeply felt the revolutionary fighting enthusiasm and vigorous spirit expressed in the entire performance of the Ensemble. The lively and vibrant performance style is also so similar to the artistic forms that the masses in our country love to see and hear.
    The programs of the Ensemble were performed in the form of song suites, organically combining rich programs into five parts, and ingeniously combining song, dance, poetry recitation, and painting. The first part: "Lenin Awakened the World from Sleep." At the beginning of the suite, the choir, holding high the portrait of the great revolutionary leader and teacher Lenin, sang the "Song of Lenin" in a solemn and sonorous voice. Then they sang the battle song of the first worker-peasant team in German history, "We Are in the Front," and the ode to the armed forces born in the German working class's struggle against white terror, "Red Hundred." The majestic and powerful march made us hear the firm steps of the German working class uniting as one and heading towards the revolutionary struggle at that time.
    In the song suite "We Will Not Show Weakness Before Fascism," the song "Red Wedding" by a propaganda team of the German Communist Party and the very moving narrative song "Red Cloth" were sung. This is a song written by revolutionary fighters imprisoned in a fascist concentration camp. The choir, with deep and resolute singing, narrated the heroic and moving story of the German workers' heroic struggle with the enemy to defend the red flag made of cloth stained with blood, demonstrating the German working class's tenacious revolutionary will and noble qualities. They sang the song praising the outstanding sons and revolutionary leaders of the German people with a proud mood: "Raise Your Fists for Comrade Thälmann." In the dance "It Won't Succeed," French, African-American, Jewish, and German Communists appeared, showing that they did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives to join the International Brigades and help the Spanish brothers in their anti-fascist struggle. The recitation actor recited in clear Chinese with an excited tone: "Salute Czechoslovakia... Salute France... Salute the Polish guerrillas, salute the Soviet Red Army!" and sang the battle songs of these brother countries. When reciting "Salute the Chinese People's Liberation Army," the "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" was sung. The enthusiastic momentum formed by the choir and the orchestra brought the audience into the mighty march of the powerful international proletariat. All this made people deeply understand the great and profound international significance of the slogan "Workers of All Countries, Unite," which is forever like spring thunder.
    The audience appreciated the singing of the song suite "Clear the Ruins, Rebuild Our Homes," which praised the new socialist life, with a very fresh and excited mood. Among them was the song "Brandenburg is Laughing," which praised the first steel flow of the newly built steel plant. There was a dance describing the peasants moving towards rural socialism: "Oxen and Tractors Race." There was a song "Happy Young Captain," sung by several characters appearing on stage with very optimistic expressions, attracting the audience. These songs and dances showed the joy and happiness of the people of Democratic Germany working enthusiastically for socialist construction under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. In this set of songs and dances, especially exciting was the program of singing our country's song "Socialism is Good" in Chinese. This set of performances left a deep impression on the Chinese audience of the thriving new face of Democratic Germany in socialist construction.
    The song and dance drama "Young Soldiers," "Military Exercise," and "Song of the Three-Man Assault Team," performed in the last two sets of songs and dances of the Ensemble, described how soldiers learn how to use weapons, for whom they take up weapons, and against whom. The bright and powerful music and agile dance movements expressed the character of resourceful and brave revolutionary soldiers. In the dance "War Maniacs," the images of Dulles, Adenauer, and others appeared, profoundly satirizing the ugliness of the reactionaries. They also sang "We Must Liberate Taiwan" with hatred for American imperialism and confidence that the Chinese people will surely win.
    The most prominent feature of the artistic style of the People's Army Ensemble of Democratic Germany is the combination of a high degree of ideology and vivid and diverse art forms, closely combining with realistic struggles and life, praising the working class's struggle against fascist tyranny and for the defense of peace and socialism; expressing a lofty spirit of internationalism and sincere friendship. It clearly embodies that art serves politics and serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, it plays a role in inspiring people, raising awareness, and encouraging people to dedicate themselves to the revolutionary cause. As the Ensemble itself requires: "Not only use the beauty of art to influence the audience, but more importantly, use the spirit contained in the lyrics—the socialist spirit—to inspire people's hearts." It should also be emphasized that in terms of the form of the performance, the combination of song, dance, poetry, and painting not only allows the audience to hear, but also allows the audience to see. The songs they sang are all short and simple, but they create moving musical pictures. Therefore, it has been universally and enthusiastically welcomed. As an army ensemble, it also prominently demonstrates the style of a revolutionary army. It deserves to be an outstanding propaganda team of the Party and the people's army. (Attached picture)

    革命的风格，群众的风格
    晓河
    首都的观众以热烈和兴奋的心情，欢迎德意志民主共和国人民军埃利希·魏纳特歌舞团的演出。歌舞团的每个节目，都以激动人心的表演和观众的感情融汇在一起。“革命的风格，群众的风格”，成了观众赞赏演出的共同语言。人们深深感到歌舞团的整个演出所表现的那种充满着革命的战斗热情和蓬勃的朝气。那种生动活泼的演出形式，和我国群众所喜闻乐见的艺术形式又是多么相近。
    歌舞团的节目是以组歌的形式进行演出的，把丰富的节目有机地组合为五个部分，并且把歌、舞、诗朗诵和画巧妙地结合在一起。第一部分：“列宁把世界从睡梦中唤醒”。组歌开始，合唱队高举着伟大的革命领袖和导师列宁的画像，以庄严、浑厚的歌声唱出了“列宁之歌”。接着演唱了德国历史上第一支工农队伍的战歌“我们在前列”，和德国工人阶级在反对白色恐怖斗争中诞生的武装部队——“红色百人团”的颂歌“赤卫队”。雄壮有力的进行曲，使我们听到当时德国工人阶级团结一致，走向革命斗争的坚强的步伐。
    在“我们不在法西斯面前示弱”组歌中，演唱了德国共产党一支宣传队的歌“红色威丁”和十分动人的叙事歌“红色的布片”。这是被监禁在法西斯集中营里的革命战士写的歌曲。合唱队以深沉而坚毅的歌声，叙述着德国工人为保卫用鲜血染成的布片做成的红旗，与敌人进行着英勇斗争的可歌可泣的英雄故事，表现了德国工人阶级顽强不屈的革命意志和高贵的品质。他们以充满自豪的情绪，演唱歌颂德国人民优秀的儿子和革命领袖的歌曲：“为了台尔曼同志，高举起拳头”。舞蹈“不能得逞”中，出现法国人、美国黑人、犹太人和德国共产党员，表现了他们不惜牺牲生命去参加了国际纵队，帮助西班牙的兄弟进行反法西斯斗争。朗诵演员用清楚的中国话以激动的语气朗诵：“向捷克斯洛伐克……向法国……向波兰游击队员致敬，向苏联红军致敬！”并唱起了这些兄弟国家的战斗歌曲。当朗诵到“向中国人民解放军致敬”时，唱起了“中国人民解放军进行曲”。合唱队和乐队构成的热烈的声势，把观众带到了强大的国际无产阶级队伍浩浩荡荡的行进中去了。这一切都使人们深深地意味着“全世界无产者联合起来”这个永远像春雷般的口号的巨大而深远的国际意义。
    观众以十分清新和兴奋的心情，欣赏了歌颂社会主义新生活的“清除废墟，重建家园”组歌的演唱。其中有歌颂新建的钢铁厂第一次钢水奔流的歌曲“布兰登堡在欢笑”。有描写农民走向农村社会主义的舞蹈：“牛和拖拉机赛跑”。有以几个人物上场表演，以非常乐观的表情吸引着观众的演唱歌曲“幸福的青年船长”。这些歌舞表现了民主德国的人民在德国统一社会党领导下为社会主义建设而热情劳动的愉快和幸福。在这组歌舞中尤其令人兴奋的节目是用中国语唱出了我国的歌曲“社会主义好”。这一组演唱使中国观众对于民主德国在社会主义建设中欣欣向荣的新面貌留下了深刻的印象。
    歌舞团最后两组歌舞中表演的歌舞剧“年轻的士兵”“军事演习”和“三人突击队之歌”，描写了战士学习如何使用武器，他们拿起武器是为了什么人服务和反对什么人。明朗有力的音乐和敏捷的舞蹈动作表现了机智、勇敢的革命军人的性格。舞蹈“战争狂人”中出现了杜勒斯、阿登纳等形象，深刻地讽刺了反动派的丑态。他们还怀着对美帝国主义的憎愤和对中国人民一定能获得胜利的信心唱起了“一定要解放台湾”。
    民主德国人民军歌舞团艺术风格的最突出的特点是高度的思想性和生动、多样的艺术形式相结合，紧紧地结合了现实斗争和生活，歌颂了工人阶级为反对法西斯暴政和维护和平与社会主义的斗争；表现了崇高的国际主义精神和真诚的友谊。鲜明地体现了艺术为政治服务，为工农兵服务。因而起着激动人心、提高觉悟、鼓舞人们献身于革命事业的作用。正如歌舞团自己所要求的那样：“不仅用艺术的美去影响观众，更重要的是要用歌词中所包含的精神——社会主义精神去鼓舞人们的心灵”。还要着重提到的是在表演的形式上，把歌、舞、诗、画相结合，不仅使观众听到，而且使观众看到。他们所演唱的歌曲都是短小、平易的，但是创造了动人心灵的音乐画面。因而受到了人们普遍热烈的欢迎。作为军队的歌舞团还突出的表现了革命军队的气派。不愧为党的和人民军队的出色的宣传队。（附图片）
