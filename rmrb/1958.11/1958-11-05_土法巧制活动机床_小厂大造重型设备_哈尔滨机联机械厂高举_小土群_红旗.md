Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The staff and workers of Harbin Machine United Machinery Factory are bold and ingenious, daring to think and daring to act. Under “four no’s” conditions (no large factory buildings, no large machine tools or large cranes, no steel casting equipment, and no engineers), they manufactured more than 100 large-scale machinery and equipment such as 32 square meter vacuum filters, 4-meter diameter ball mills, 4.2-meter high washing machines, and 50-ton cement dryers, supporting the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant. This vivid example sets a good example for small factories manufacturing large machines.

The Machine United Machinery Factory is a small factory with dilapidated buildings and outdated equipment. The factory buildings are less than four meters high, the center height of the largest lathe is only 300 mm, and the largest gantry planer is only one meter wide. The recently installed converter is only half a ton. The processing workshop doesn't even have a decent crane. Obviously, it is impossible to manufacture the above-mentioned tall, thick, and heavy equipment by relying on these "family assets." However, difficulties turned into a driving force for the heroes to create miracles. All the staff and workers, on the one hand, made do with whatever was available, adopted methods such as working in the open air, using scaffolding, chain hoists, and capstans for lifting to overcome the difficulties of having no large factory buildings and no large cranes. On the other hand, they used their brains, worked hard, and created a "building block" mobile machine tool to replace large machine tools to process large workpieces.

This amazing machine only has "three major parts": the cutter (cutting head), the rotor (transmission device), and the body (machine tool bed). According to the needs of the product, like children's building blocks, it can be freely assembled into various temporary machine tools with different structures, different processing methods, and different functions to manufacture various large mechanical equipment. This machine is manufactured using old machine tool parts, automobile, tank gear transmission boxes, as well as old angle steel and I-beam steel. This machine tool is not dedicated to any one workshop and can be moved at any time according to needs.

Using this method, they have assembled large lathes, large boring machines, large gear milling machines, large surface milling machines, and planers. They used these large machine tools to turn the large outer circle of a 3-meter diameter vacuum filter, bore and rotate the 1.5-meter diameter cylinder of a vacuum pump, milled large gears with a diameter of nearly 4 meters, and milled and planed large surfaces exceeding 4 meters in width. They manufactured a large washing machine for Anshan Iron and Steel. According to conventional methods, it would require a large lathe weighing dozens of tons to manufacture, but they only used a few old steel rails, a gearbox from an old car, and a few milling cutters to make it. The specific method is: weld a frame with steel rails, support the machine part to be made with a large shaft, let the gearbox drive it to rotate, and fix the tool holder on the ground, so that the machine part being processed moves and the cutter does not. The quality of the machine parts manufactured in this way is the same as that made with new special machine tools.

This "building block" mobile machine tool has greater advantages than the special local machine tool of "ants gnawing at bones." The "ants gnawing at bones" machine tool can only process one fixed product, while this mobile machine tool can process any mechanical part. With the experience of Machine United Machinery Factory, all large and small machinery factories in our country can manufacture large mechanical equipment. This machine tool is easy to operate, and workers who have just entered the factory can use it. Workers can also quickly improve their technical level by using this machine tool to produce various products. (Attached pictures)

    土法巧制活动机床
    小厂大造重型设备
    哈尔滨机联机械厂高举“小土群”红旗
    本报讯　哈尔滨市机联机械厂职工胆大心巧，敢想敢干，在“四无”（一无大厂房，二无大机床大吊车，三无铸钢设备，四无工程师）的条件下，制出了三十二平方公尺真空过滤机、直径四公尺的球磨机、高达四公尺二的洗涤机、重达五十吨的水泥烘干机等大型机器设备一百多台，支援鞍钢、武钢、包钢、富拉尔基重机厂等的建设。这一生动的事例为小工厂制造大机器树立了良好的榜样。
    机联机械厂是一个厂房残破、设备陈旧的小厂子。厂房高不到四公尺，最大车床的中心高不过三百公厘，最大的龙门刨才一公尺宽，最近刚安起来的转炉只有半吨，加工车间连一架像样的吊车也没有。显然，依靠这些“家当”来制造上述又高、又粗、又重的设备是不可能的。但是，困难变成了英雄们创造奇迹的动力。全厂职工一面因陋就简，采取露天干活，用脚手架子、链条滑车、绞磨来起重等办法，克服没有大厂房、没有大吊车等困难，一面开动脑筋，刻苦钻研，创造了一种“积木式”活动机床来代替大机床，加工大活。
    这种奇妙的机器只有刀子（切削头）、转子（传动装置）和身子（机床床身）这“三大件”，可以根据产品的需要，像儿童玩的积木一样，随心所欲地组成各种结构不同、加工方法不同、功能不同的临时机床，用来制造各种大型的机械设备。这种机器是利用旧机床机件、汽车、坦克齿轮传动箱以及旧角钢、工字钢等制造的。这种机床不属于哪一个车间专用，可以根据需要，随时搬家。
    他们运用这种方法，曾经组并过大车床、大镗床、大铣齿机、大平面铣床和刨床。他们用这些大机床，车削过三公尺直径真空过滤器的大外圆，镗旋过孔径一公尺半的真空泵汽缸，铣过直径近四公尺的大齿轮，铣刨过宽度超过四公尺的大平面。他们给鞍钢制造一部大洗涤机，按照常规，要有几十吨重的大车床才能制造，可是他们只用几根旧钢轨、一个旧汽车上的齿轮箱和几把铣刀，就做出来了。具体的做法是：用钢轨焊成一个架子，把要做的机器部件用一根大轴架起来，让齿轮箱带它转动，刀架安在地上，被加工的机器部件动，刀子不动。这样制造出来的机件，同用新式专用机床做的质量一样。
    这种“积木式”的活动机床，比“蚂蚁啃骨头”的专用土机床有更大的优越性。“蚂蚁啃骨头”的机床只能加工一种固定的产品，这种活动机床却能加工任何机械部件。有了机联机械厂的经验，我国现有的大大小小的机械工厂都可以制造大型机械设备了。这种机床由于操纵方便，进厂不久的工人都可以使用；工人们经常使用这种机床生产各种各样的产品，技术水平也可以很快提高。（附图片）
