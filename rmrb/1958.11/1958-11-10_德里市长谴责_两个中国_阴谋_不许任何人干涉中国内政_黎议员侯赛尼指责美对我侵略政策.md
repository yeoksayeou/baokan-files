Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 8th: Delhi Mayor Aruna Asaf Ali said here today, "The United States' spreading of the 'Two Chinas' fallacy on the Taiwan issue is a very dangerous act. No freedom-loving country would tolerate this. We should unremittingly oppose this practice."

She met with a Xinhua News Agency reporter at City Hall. She said, "Everyone here is very clear that Taiwan and the coastal islands belong to China. This is purely China's internal affair. Once the alliance between Chiang Kai-shek and the United States collapses, this issue can be resolved. No imperialists are allowed to interfere in China's internal affairs."

Mrs. Asaf Ali is a famous leader of the Indian national movement. She also pointed out: Judging from newspaper reports and the Chiang-Dulles Joint Communiqué, there is discord between Chiang Kai-shek and the United States. Only if Chiang Kai-shek changes his policy of being manipulated by the United States can he restore his own dignity. She added that the Taiwan issue has nothing to do with the United States and should not be influenced by the United States.

The Delhi Mayor said, "Our country has deep feelings and great sympathy for the Chinese people." She praised China's Great Leap Forward in agriculture and industry. She said that the Indian people are very familiar with this fact. Many people, including intellectuals, officials, and people from different parties, have come to discuss this issue with her.

She said that it would be very beneficial to exchange experiences in national construction not only between government officials but also among the people. The Indian masses should know the new methods of Chinese farmers and workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, November 7th: Lebanese Member of Parliament Hashim Hussein, when meeting with a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Tripoli on the 5th, accused the United States of provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait region and gross interference in China's internal affairs. He pointed out that the US occupation of Taiwan is nothing more than part of the imperialist aggressive plan in the Far East.

    德里市长谴责“两个中国”阴谋
    不许任何人干涉中国内政
    黎议员侯赛尼指责美对我侵略政策
    新华社新德里8日电　德里市长阿鲁娜·阿萨夫·阿里夫人今天在这里说，“现在美国在台湾局势问题上散布‘两个中国’的谬论是非常危险的行为。没有一个爱好自由的国家会容忍这种做法。我们应该坚持不懈地反对这种做法。”
    她在市政大厅接见了新华社记者。她说：“这里每一个人都很清楚，台湾和沿海岛屿是属于中国的。这纯粹是中国的内政。一旦蒋介石和美国的联盟拆台，这个问题就能够解决。任何帝国主义者都不许干涉中国的内政。”
    阿萨夫·阿里夫人是印度民族运动的著名领袖。她还指出：根据报纸消息和蒋杜联合公报来判断，蒋介石和美国之间是不和的。蒋介石只有改变他的受美国摆布的政策，才能恢复他自己的尊严。她又说，台湾问题与美国无关，这个问题不该受到美国的影响。
    德里市长说：“我们国家里对中国人民有很深的感情和很大的同情。”她赞扬中国在农业和工业方面的大跃进。她说，印度人民很熟悉这个事实。许多人，包括知识分子、官员和不同党派的人，都来同她讨论这个问题。
    她说，不仅在政府官员之间而且在人民之间也互相交流国家建设的经验，那会是非常有益的。印度的群众应该知道中国农民和工人的新方法。
    据新华社贝鲁特7日电　黎巴嫩议员哈希姆·侯赛尼5日在的黎波里接见新华社记者时，指责美国在台湾海峡地区对中国的挑衅和对中国内政的粗暴干涉。他指出，美国占领台湾不过是帝国主义在远东的侵略计划的一部分。
