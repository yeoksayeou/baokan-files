Shanxi, November 2nd. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, after the national high-yield week in steel, organized a provincial high-yield week centered on steel from October 25th to 31st. During this week, nearly four million steelworkers in the province fought valiantly on the new steel bases of the Taihang Mountains, Taiyue Mountains, Lüliang Mountains, Zhongtiao Mountains, and Hengshan Mountains, concentrating their efforts to ensure key areas, key counties and cities, key townships and communes, and key enterprises, giving full play to the power of "small indigenous groups" and "large foreign groups," so that steel production soared on the basis of the national high-yield week. The average daily iron output was 110,000 tons, an increase of more than eight times compared to the previous high-yield week; the average daily steel output was 17,400 tons, an increase of 80.7% compared to the previous high-yield week. On October 31st, the province's pig iron production reached 694,616 tons (in addition, there were 224,337 tons of sintered iron), which was 14,616 tons more than the state's annual iron production target of 680,000 tons for Shanxi Province; steel production reached 89,881 tons, creating an unprecedented record for the province. On the 31st, Changzhi Prefecture produced 70,122 tons of steel, exceeding the highest record created by Xinyang Prefecture in Henan Province during the national high-yield week; the daily iron production was 393,548 tons, ranking first in the province. Four counties and cities, including Jincheng, Yangcheng, Changzhi, and Taiyuan, emerged with a daily output of 10,000 to 20,000 tons of steel, and two counties, Yangcheng and Jincheng, produced 120,000 to 170,000 tons of pig iron per day. Eight people's communes, including Jincheng County and Bagong, produced 1,000 to 7,000 tons of steel per day, and twelve people's communes, including Yangcheng and Ciying, produced 10,000 to 50,000 tons of iron per day.

    Simultaneous with the high yield of steel, Shanxi's coal production also increased by leaps and bounds.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, November 1st. Anhui Province's more than five million steelworkers further consolidated and developed the achievements of the high-yield week in steel production. On October 28th, the province's pig iron production reached more than 13,000 tons and steel production reached more than 1,600 tons, which were more than double and more than six times the average daily output of the high-yield week in steel from October 15th to 21st, respectively.

    In this battle for steel, Wuhu Prefecture came from behind and jumped to the top of the province in terms of iron production; the daily iron output of Hefei City has broken through the 1,000-ton mark, and the steel output has jumped to the first in the province. The steel output of Liu'an Prefecture increased by more than double and more than two times compared to the 27th. In Anqing Prefecture, seventy-four "satellite furnaces" appeared on this day, and a small indigenous furnace with a volume of 0.5 cubic meters achieved a daily pig iron production of 20 tons.

    Anhui Province's steel production has achieved close cooperation in all aspects. In mines and on mountains, next to charcoal kilns, and on transportation lines, there are crowds of people cooperating with the steel army. From the 25th to the 27th, three days, more than 93,000 tons of ore, more than 22,000 tons of limestone, more than 27,000 tons of iron sand, more than 96,000 tons of coal, and more than 20,000 tons of coke were produced throughout the province. More than one million steel transport troops in the province traveled day and night, rushing various materials to the construction site in time within three days. Now, all localities are advancing victoriously, determined to achieve greater results.

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 2nd. Hunan Province continued to advance on the basis of creating an average daily output of 10,000 tons of iron during the high-yield week in steel. On October 31st, the province launched "satellites" with a daily output of 37,742 tons of pig iron, 3,353 tons of steel, and 817,939 tons of coal, and completed the external transfer task of 33,617 tons of pig iron.

    In the high-yield day of the 31st, eight counties in the province appeared with a daily output of more than 1,000 tons of pig iron. Among them, Lianyuan County had the highest, with a daily pig iron output of 12,677 tons. Twenty-four counties reached the level of 10,000 tons of coal per day.

    Hunan Province's high steel production record on the 31st has the following significant characteristics: it is not a high yield from one furnace, but a high yield from every furnace; it is not a small-scale harvest, but a large-scale harvest; not only is the quantity large, but the quality is also good. This situation marks a significant improvement in the province's steel production capacity and technical level compared to September.

    Due to the continuous growth of pig iron and raw coal production, the province has overfulfilled the state's pig iron production plan for October by more than 70% and the raw coal production monthly plan by 145%. At present, the province's steel army is continuing to work hard, striving to complete the annual steel production task one month ahead of schedule.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 2nd. Sichuan Province's steadily rising pig iron production took a big step forward on October 31st. On this day, more than 100,000 iron-smelting furnaces and large and small iron-smelting kilns in the province were ignited together, producing a total of 200,3858 tons of iron (of which 81,666 tons were first-class iron and 122,192 tons were second-class iron).

    Since October, Sichuan Province has adopted the method of "rectification in front of the furnace" and launched a debate on running the steel industry by the whole party and the whole people among the more than six million iron-smelting troops. Through rectification, the vast number of cadres and masses have further increased their confidence in running the steel industry on a large scale, so a new situation has emerged in which the whole party and the whole people are studying technology and mining, coal mining, iron smelting, and coking are all advancing at the same time. Since the second half of October, the output and quality of pig iron in the province have been continuously improved. A higher record was created on the last day of October.

    Sichuan Province's large-scale iron production this time was achieved under the unified mobilization of superior manpower, the unified utilization of coal and iron resources, and joint operations. In order to increase the iron production more quickly, various localities have also selected several points with concentrated iron ore, high grade, and convenient fuel supply to build large kilns for iron smelting. All localities have organized a large number of expeditionary forces to go to areas rich in ore and coal to mine on the spot, build kilns on the spot, and smelt on the spot, creating an unprecedented moving scene of communist collaboration.

    高产周后连续高产
    山西一天生铁产量等于全年任务
  　安徽月底产量比高产周提高一倍
    湖南日产三万多吨产量多质量好
  　四川大小铁炉日产超过二十万吨
    本报太原2日电　山西省提前两个月超额六十七万九千吨完成国家分配的全年铁的生产任务，钢的全年生产任务也接近完成。
    中共山西省委在全国钢铁高产周以后，接着又组织了自10月25日到31日的全省以钢为纲的全面高产周。在这一周里，全省近四百万钢铁大军，奋勇地战斗在太行山、太岳山、吕梁山、中条山、恒山等新型的钢铁基地上，集中全力，保证重点地区、重点县市、重点乡社，以及重点企业，大大地发挥了“小土群”和“大洋群”的威力，使钢铁产量，在全国高产周的基础上飞跃上升。铁的平均日产量十一万吨，比上一个高产周增长了八倍多；钢的平均日产量一万七千四百吨，比上一个高产周增长80.7％。10月31日这一天，全省生铁产量达到六十九万四千六百十六吨（另外还有烧结铁二十二万四千三百三十七吨），比国家分配给山西省的全年六十八万吨铁的生产任务还多出一万四千六百十六吨；钢产量达到八万九千八百八十一吨，创造了全省空前纪录。31日，这一天，长治专区日产钢七万零一百二十二吨，超过了河南省信阳专区在全国高产周中创造的最高纪录；日产铁三十九万三千五百四十八吨，跃居全省第一位。全省涌现出日产万吨到两万吨钢的有晋城、阳城、长治、太原等四个县市，日产生铁十二万吨到十七万吨的有阳城、晋城两个县，日产钢一千吨到七千吨的有晋城县、巴公等八个人民公社，日产万吨到五万吨铁的有阳城、次营等十二个人民公社。
    和钢铁高产的同时，山西全省煤炭产量也有飞跃的增长。
    新华社合肥1日电　安徽省五百多万钢铁大军进一步巩固和发扬钢铁生产高产周的成就，在10月28日，使全省生铁产量达到一万三千多吨、钢一千六百多吨；比10月15日至21日钢铁高产周的平均日产量分别提高一倍多和六倍多。
    在这场钢铁大战中，芜湖专区后来居上，在铁的产量上一跃而居全省之冠；合肥市铁的日产量已突破千吨关，钢的产量已跃居全省第一。六安专区钢铁产量分别比27日陡增一倍和两倍以上。安庆专区在这一天中，共出现了七十四个“卫星炉”，有一座零点五立方公尺的小土炉达到日产生铁二十吨。
    安徽省钢铁生产取得了各方面的紧密配合。在矿井和矿山上，在木炭窑旁，在交通运输线上，到处都有配合钢铁大军作战的人群。从25日到27日三天中，全省各地共开采矿石九万三千多吨、石灰石二万二千多吨、淘铁砂二万七千多吨、生产煤炭九万六千多吨、焦炭二万多吨。全省一百多万钢铁运输大军，日夜兼程，在三天之内及时把各种物资赶运到工地。现在各地正乘胜前进，决心夺取更大成绩。
    新华社长沙2日电　湖南省在钢铁高产周中创造平均日产万吨铁的基础上继续前进。10月31日，全省又发射了日产生铁三万七千七百四十二吨、钢三千三百五十三吨、煤八十一万七千九百三十九吨的“卫星”，并且完成了三万三千六百一十七吨的生铁外调任务。
    在31日的高产日中，全省出现了八个日产生铁千吨以上的县。其中，涟源县最高，日产生铁一万二千六百七十七吨。有二十四个县达到日产万吨煤的水平。
    湖南省31日的钢铁高产纪录，有着如下显著的特点：不是一炉高产，而是炉炉高产；不是小片丰收，而是大面积丰收；不仅数量多，质量也好。这一情况标志着全省钢铁生产能力和技术水平，比9月份有了很大提高。
    由于生铁、原煤产量不断增长，10月份全省已超额70％以上完成了国家生铁产量计划，超额145％完成了原煤生产月计划。目前，全省钢铁大军正在继续努力，力争提前一个月完成全年的钢铁生产任务。
    据新华社重庆2日电　稳步上升的四川省生铁生产，在10月31日又向前跃进了一大步。这一天，全省十多万座炼铁炉和大小炼铁窑一齐点火，共产生铁二十万零三千八百五十八吨（其中一类铁为八万一千六百六十六吨，二类铁为十二万二千一百九十二吨）。
    10月份以来，四川省采取“炉前整风”的办法，在六百多万炼铁大军中开展了全党全民大办钢铁的辩论。广大干部、群众通过整风，进一步增加了大办钢铁工业的信心，因此出现了全党全民钻技术和采矿、采煤、炼铁、炼焦同时跃进的新局面。全省从10月下半月起，生铁的产量、质量就不断提高。在10月份的最后一天创造了更高的纪录。
    四川省这次生铁大面积丰产，是在统一调集优势的人力、统一利用煤铁资源，联合作战的情况下取得的。为了更快地提高铁的产量，各地还选择铁矿集中、品位较高和燃料供应方便的若干点，搞大窑炼铁。各地都组织大批远征军，开往矿石、煤炭丰富的地区，就地采矿，就地建窑、冶炼，出现了空前未有的共产主义大协作的动人场面。
