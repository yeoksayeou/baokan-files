    Just Watch the Globe Tomorrow, It Will Surely Be a World of the East Wind
    Li Xianrong, Chinese student in the Soviet Union
    A year ago today was an extraordinary day for us students in the Soviet Union. That afternoon, Chairman Mao came to Lenin Hills in Moscow and met thousands of students studying in the Soviet Union in the skyscraper of Moscow University, and gave a brief but epoch-making speech to everyone. Our great leader solemnly declared: "The direction of the world's wind has changed. ... Now it is not the West wind prevailing over the East wind, but the East wind prevailing over the West wind.” It has been a year since Chairman Mao's speech. When we recall these words again, they still resonate in our ears like thunder. Today, this sentence is well known to every household. Even seven or eight-year-old primary school students in the Soviet Union know it. In the newspapers and periodicals of the socialist camp and the countries fighting for national independence and liberation, it is often used as the headline in bold letters. Even some Western newspapers often mention this sentence in an alarmed tone. Why can such a simple sentence so universally and deeply inspire people and become a great force to encourage the people of the world? Because it is a great objective truth that fully reflects the essence of objective historical development.

    Looking back at the great leap forward in all aspects of the socialist camp in the past year, the vigorous independence and liberation movements of various oppressed nations in Asia and Africa in the past year, and the movements of people in various imperialist countries to fight for democracy and peace in the past year, all confirm the great truth that the East wind prevails over the West wind.

    The West wind is not willing to disappear by itself, and imperialism is struggling all the time. Their ghosts appeared in the socialist camp. The shameful Tito group desperately served the US dollar, attempting to split the entire socialist camp and the world workers' movement. But this delusion was shattered. Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech to the students in the Soviet Union: There are our people in the imperialist camp, and there are also a very few of their people in our camp. The Tito group is just one of these very few people. Through the international working class's struggle against revisionism, the true face of this small group of people has been fully exposed. The socialist camp and the world workers' movement are even more united.

    British and American imperialism also set fires in the Middle East, which is also a kind of struggle. But the West wind did not gain power there because of this. Under the firm opposition of the people of the Middle East and the people of the world, the British and American troops rolled out of Lebanon and Jordan. American imperialism then came to the Taiwan Strait of China to provoke. This time the struggle suffered an even more tragic fate, to the point where people like Eisenhower and Dulles were restless and racking their brains. Do you see them constantly screaming? That is precisely a reflection of their uneasy situation.

    Let's take a look at the speech made by our great leader Chairman Mao at the Supreme State Conference in our country not long ago! He said: "If the American monopoly capital group insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably be sentenced to hanging by the people of the world one day. The same will be true of other American accomplices."

    As we excitedly recall this unforgettable meeting a year ago, I cannot help but think of what the great communist Li Dazhao said decades ago: "Looking at the future world, it will surely be a world of red flags." Let us also raise our arms and shout: "Just watch the globe tomorrow, it will surely be a world of the East wind!"

    试看明日寰球，定是东风世界
    中国留苏学生　李显荣
    去年的今天，对我们留苏学生来说，是一个不平凡的日子。这天下午，毛主席来到莫斯科的列宁山上，在莫斯科大学的摩天大楼里会见了几千名留苏学生，向大家作了一个简短的、但有着划时代意义的讲话。我们伟大的领袖庄严地宣告：“世界的风向变了。……现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。”毛主席的讲话，不觉已是一周年。我们再一次回忆起这些话来，总还巨雷一般地在我们耳边震响。今天，这句话已经家喻户晓。在苏联连七、八岁的小学生都知道它。在社会主义阵营以及为争取民族独立解放的国家的报刊上，经常以黑体大字把它做为头条新闻的标题，即使在一些西方的报刊上也经常以惊恐的语气提到这句话。为什么一句简单的话，能这样普遍深入地振奋人心，并且成为鼓舞世界人民的伟大力量呢？因为它是一个伟大的客观真理，充分反映着客观历史发展的实质。
    回顾一年来社会主义阵营各方面的大跃进，回顾一年来亚非地区各个被压迫民族的如火如荼的独立解放运动，回顾一年来各个帝国主义国家内人民的争取民主与和平的运动，在在都证实着东风压倒西风这个伟大的真理。
    西风不甘兀自泯灭，帝国主义时时刻刻都在进行挣扎：他们的幽灵，在社会主义阵营内出现了，可耻的铁托集团，拼命地为美元服务，企图分裂整个社会主义阵营和世界工人运动。但是这种妄想破灭了。毛主席在对留苏学生的讲话中曾经指出：在帝国主义阵营中有我们的人，在我们阵营中也有极少数是他们的人。铁托集团不过是这极少数人中的一种。经过国际工人阶级的反对修正主义的斗争，这一小批人的真面目已暴露无遗。社会主义阵营和全世界的工人运动更加团结了。
    美英帝国主义也曾在中东放火，这也是挣扎的一种。但是西风并没有因此在那里得势，在中东人民和世界人民的坚决反对下，美英军队滚出了黎巴嫩和约旦。美帝国主义随即又到中国的台湾海峡来挑衅，这次的挣扎遭到了更悲惨的命运，以至使得艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流坐卧不安，大伤脑筋，你看到他们在不断地嘶喊了吗？那正是反映着他们心神不宁的处境。
    我们还是看一看我们伟大的领袖毛主席不久前在我国最高国务会议上的讲话吧！他说：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其它美国帮凶也将是这样。”
    当我们兴奋地想起一年前的这个难忘的会见的时候，我不禁想起伟大的共产主义者李大钊同志在几十年前就说过的话：“试看将来的寰球，必将是赤旗的世界。”让我们也振臂高呼：“试看明日的寰球，必将是东风的世界！”
