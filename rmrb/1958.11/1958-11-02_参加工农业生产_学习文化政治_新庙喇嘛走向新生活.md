    Participate in Industrial and Agricultural Production, Study Culture and Politics
    Lamas of Xinmiao Embark on a New Life
    (Our report) The people of Xinmiao Township, Junwang Banner, Inner Mongolia's Ikh Chao League, enthusiastically sing: "Xinmiao has beautiful mountains and clear waters, but few lamas are seen at the temple during the day; if you ask where the lamas have gone, look for them in the fields."
    Since liberation, the lamas of Xinmiao have responded to the call of the Party and resolutely advanced on the socialist road. The lamas of the entire temple established mutual aid teams in 1951, and in 1953 they jointly established Mongolian-Han mutual aid teams with Han farmers. By the winter of 1954, they had joined the Xinfeng Agricultural Cooperative, and now they have actively joined the People's Commune.
    They actively engage in production, learning many production techniques. All lamas have mastered general agricultural techniques and know how to plant trees and repair water conservancy facilities. Some also know how to make paper, install and repair electric lights, do carpentry, weld copperware, and run flour mills. Among the fifty-seven lamas, eleven have been selected as model workers. The seventy-five-year-old lama, Gongga Wuzi, was selected as a model afforestation worker in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    The lamas established a newspaper reading group in 1951 and have persisted in reading the newspaper for seven years. This autumn, a Mongolian language amateur junior high school class has been established, and the lamas have all participated in the learning. They say that after participating in labor production, Xinmiao has seen "two fragrances and three no hindrances." The two fragrances are the fragrance of food after labor and the fragrance of sleep, and the three no hindrances are no hindrance to labor, no hindrance to learning, and no hindrance to chanting scriptures.

    参加工农业生产　学习文化政治
    新庙喇嘛走向新生活
    本报讯　“山清水秀是‘新庙’，白天庙上的喇嘛少；你问喇嘛那去了，庄稼地里你去找。”内蒙古伊克昭盟郡王旗新庙乡人民热情歌唱着参加劳动的喇嘛。
    新庙的喇嘛，解放以来就响应了党的号召，坚决在社会主义道路上前进。全庙的喇嘛从1951年起成立了互助组，1953年又和汉族农民联合成立了蒙汉互助组，到1954年冬他们就加入了新丰农业社，现在他们又积极地加入了人民公社。
    他们在生产上积极劳动，学到了许多生产技术，所有喇嘛都能掌握一般农业技术，都会造林修水利，还有些人会造纸、学安装修理电灯、木工、焊铜器、开粉房等。在五十七个喇嘛中已有十一个人被选为劳动模范了。七十五岁的老喇嘛贡嘎伍子，被选为内蒙古自治区造林模范。
    喇嘛们从1951年成立读报组，七年如一日地坚持读报。今秋，一座蒙文业余初中班已经成立，喇嘛都参加了学习。他们说：参加劳动生产后，新庙出现了“两香三不误”。两香是劳动吃饭香、睡觉香，三不误是不误劳动、不误学习、不误念经。　（袁宏贻）
