Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: News from Tokyo indicates that the Kishi Nobusuke group in Japan has openly begun preparations to use the Japanese army—the "Ground Self-Defense Force"—to suppress the Japanese people's struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's restoration of militarism. This is a new fascist action taken by the Kishi Nobusuke group after embarking on the road of militarism.

The Jiji Press quoted well-informed sources as saying that the Special Committee on Security Countermeasures of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan has repeatedly discussed this issue with the "Defense Agency." This committee "has requested the Defense Agency to make the necessary arrangements so that the Ground Self-Defense Force can be used to deal with any domestic emergencies and maintain peace and order." The committee also explicitly proposed using the "Ground Self-Defense Force" to help the police suppress Japanese progressive groups, including the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations.

According to a report in the "Yomiuri Shimbun" on the 16th, the "Defense Agency," at the recent request of the Liberal Democratic Party, has prepared to dispatch the "Self-Defense Forces" to step up the suppression of the increasingly high tide of mass struggles against the Kishi Nobusuke government. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that the "Defense Agency" originally had a plan for the next year centered on strengthening "maintaining public order." This plan includes: establishing a close liaison system between the "Defense Agency" and the police authorities; conducting special training for the "Self-Defense Forces" to be dispatched for "maintaining public order," and strengthening investigation and information gathering activities. The "Defense Agency" has also decided to increase personnel in accordance with the above policy.

The "Yomiuri Shimbun" pointed out that in the face of the rising tide of the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and its illegal extension of the Diet session, the Liberal Democratic Party could no longer wait for the "Defense Agency" to implement its original plan and impatiently urged the "Defense Agency" to accelerate preparations to dispatch troops to suppress the struggle of the Japanese people at the request of the Liberal Democratic Party.

    岸信介倒行逆施
    竟准备用军队来镇压人民
    新华社17日讯　来自东京的消息表明，日本首相岸信介集团已经公然着手准备使用日本陆军——“陆上自卫队”，来镇压日本人民为反对岸信介政府恢复军国主义而进行的斗争。这是岸信介集团在走上军国主义道路后所采取的新的法西斯行动。
    时事通讯社引述消息灵通人士的话说，日本执政的自由民主党的治安对策特别委员会已经同“防卫厅”多次讨论了这个问题。这个委员会“已经要求防卫厅作必要的安排，使陆上自卫队能够用于对付任何国内的紧急事件和维持和平与秩序。”委员会还明确提出，要用“陆上自卫队”帮助警察镇压包括全日本学生自治会联合会等在内的日本进步团体。
    据“读卖新闻”16日报道，“防卫厅”最近在自由民主党的要求下，已经做好派遣“自卫队”加紧镇压日益高涨的反对岸信介政府的群众斗争的准备。“读卖新闻”说，“防卫厅”本来就有以加强“维持治安”为中心的明年度计划，这项计划包括：在“防卫厅”和警察当局之间建立密切联络的体系；对“自卫队”进行为“维持治安”而出动的特别训练，加强调查和搜集情报的活动。“防卫厅”还决定按照上述方针增加人员。
    “读卖新闻”指出，自由民主党在日本人民反对修改“警察官职务执行法”和它非法延长国会会期的斗争日益高涨的形势下，已经等不得“防卫厅”实施原来的计划，而迫不及待地催促“防卫厅”按照自由民主党的要求加紧准备出动镇压日本人民群众的斗争。
