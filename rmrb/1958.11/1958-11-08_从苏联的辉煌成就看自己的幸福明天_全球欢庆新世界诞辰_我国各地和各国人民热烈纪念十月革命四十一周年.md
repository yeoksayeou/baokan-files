Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: People across the country are widely carrying out various celebration activities to solemnly commemorate the 41st anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

　　Grand celebration meetings were held across the country during this joyous festival. In cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Shenyang, and Harbin, several thousand or over ten thousand people participated in the meetings. Celebration meetings were also held in various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Xiamen on the coastal defense front, Urumqi, and Lhasa. At the meetings, the leaders of the Party and government in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions made reports, and Soviet diplomatic officials and Soviet experts invited to participate in the meetings also spoke. Many factories, institutions, and schools with Soviet experts in various cities held friendship get-togethers with Soviet experts. Various localities also launched large-scale propaganda activities to celebrate the October Revolution, held exhibitions introducing the construction achievements of the Soviet Union, Soviet music concerts, and poetry recitations. A large number of propagandists also went deep into factories, institutions, schools, and military units to give reports.

　　The leaders of the Party committees and governments in various localities elaborated in their reports on the great international significance of the October Revolution and the new situation in which the cause of communism has been surging across the world with tremendous force and the East Wind prevails over the West Wind in the 41 years since the October Revolution. These reports, in explaining the situation of the past year, proved the correctness of the two great revolutionary declarations passed by the Moscow Conference, emphasized the need to continue opposing the modern revisionism of Yugoslavia; clarified that strengthening the solidarity of proletarian internationalism and strengthening Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation are guarantees for safeguarding peace and the cause of human progress, and called for strengthening the struggle to build a socialist society in our country at an early date and gradually transition to a communist society. Chen Yu, Governor of Guangdong Province and President of the Guangdong Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said in his speech: Our goal is communism. The great Soviet people, standing at the forefront of the international communist movement, are striding towards communism. We Chinese people are also working hard with the spirit of "one day equals twenty years," striving to build socialism in our country at an early date and transition to communism. All fraternal countries are rapidly advancing along the path of socialism-communism. We firmly believe that the forces of new life will inevitably defeat the forces of decay. As long as we persist in struggle and continue the revolution, communism will surely achieve final victory in the world at an early date. Mi Jianshu, member of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Secretary of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said in his report at the meeting: "The changes in the world situation since the October Revolution show that the historical wheel of the proletarian socialist revolution cannot be stopped by any force. We must constantly strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and work together with all peace-loving people in the world to strive for the victory of the just cause of peace, democracy, socialism, and communism. Wang Kangzhi, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice President of the Tianjin Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, called on the people of Tianjin in his report to vigorously carry out a communist education movement while celebrating the October Revolution Festival, so that everyone can recognize that the realization of communism is an inevitable law of social development and further strengthen their determination to take the road of communism.

　　During this great festival, the Chinese people thanked the Soviet people for their selfless assistance to China's socialist construction and their support for China's struggle against American aggression, and cherished even more the friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Soviet people, and the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

　　Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice President of the Shanghai Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said that the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the governments and people of various socialist countries to China's construction of socialism and their support for China's struggle against American aggression, this high degree of internationalism and communist spirit, is a great encouragement to us. Zhang Ce, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and First Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said that in the struggle of the Chinese people against the war provocations of American imperialism, the Soviet government declared that aggression against China is aggression against the Soviet Union, which is a clear manifestation of a high degree of proletarian internationalism. Li Erzhong, member of the Standing Committee of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, and President of the Hubei Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said that as long as the working people of all countries consolidate and develop the unity of the communist movement headed by the Soviet Union and make unwavering efforts for the great ideal of the October Revolution—communism—victory will surely belong to the people, and American imperialism will not escape the fate of being finally executed. Party and government leaders in various localities expressed their gratitude to the Soviet experts who have worked hard to help China's construction in their speeches, and called on the local people to follow the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and humbly learn from the Soviet Union and from all fraternal countries.
