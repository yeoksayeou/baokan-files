    A Good Thing
    Yang Yi
    The practice of the Hukuan County Committee of Shanxi Province to organize a large number of leading cadres to go deep into construction sites, fields, and commune members' families for visits is worthy of attention and promotion.
    Caring for the lives of the masses is a glorious tradition of our Party, and our Party members and cadres have always had the fine style of sharing weal and woe with the masses. It is precisely this traditional style that ensures that we can understand the demands of the masses at any time and improve our work according to the demands of the masses. Today, carrying forward this traditional style is of even greater significance. In the past, when households were the units of life, although leading cadres had to pay attention to the lives of the masses, most of the life problems were handled by the masses themselves. Therefore, the main force of the leadership at that time was still placed on production. After production was successful, the solution of life problems was reliably guaranteed. After the establishment of the people's communes, the lives of the masses became increasingly collectivized. This is a new way of life. The leadership has no experience, and the masses have no experience. What new problems will collectivized life bring? How to solve these problems? This requires the leadership to frequently go deep into construction sites, fields, and families to visit and understand. After the Hukuan County Committee cadres visited, they discovered many important life problems of the commune members. For example, after all the female labor force was put into agricultural production, winter clothing was generally insufficient, and the climate was gradually getting colder, and some areas had already begun to freeze. Obviously, if this problem is not solved, it will not only affect the current production, but also affect the health of the commune members.
    It is a good thing for Hukuan County cadres to visit commune members' families. Since the realization of the collectivization of life, many cadres believe that there are very few household chores now, and therefore no longer pay attention to visiting commune members' families, and no longer pay attention to understanding and solving the problems in commune members' families. This understanding is of course wrong. After the collectivization of life, families have undergone great changes, the era of households as production units has ended, and most of the life problems of commune members' families have been handled by the collective, but the family has not been eliminated. Since the family exists, there must still be family problems. For example, some commune members do not have fuel for the winter or winter shoes and socks. Isn't this a family life problem? Are these problems not important?
    This kind of visit not only promptly solved the life problems of the commune members, but also made some cadres realize that after the collectivization of life, they must also care about the lives of the commune members, which laid the ideological foundation for further implementing the Party's policy of grasping production with one hand and life with the other.

    一件好事情
    杨义
    山西壶关县委组织大批领导干部深入工地深入田间深入社员家庭进行访问的做法，是值得重视和提倡的。
    关心群众生活，是我们党的光荣传统，我们的党员和干部从来就有和群众同甘共苦的优良作风。正是这种传统作风，保证了我们能够随时了解群众的要求，根据群众的要求改进工作。在今天，发扬这种传统作风，有更加重要的意义。在过去以一家一户为生活单位的时候，领导干部虽然也要注意关心群众的生活问题，但是大部分生活问题，是由群众自己去处理的。因此，当时领导上的主要力量还是放在生产上。生产搞好以后，生活问题的解决也就得到了可靠的保证。在成立人民公社以后，群众生活日益集体化了。这是一种新的生活方式，领导没有经验，群众也没有经验。集体化生活会带来一些什么新的问题呢？如何去解决这些问题呢？这就需要领导上经常深入工地、深入田间、深入家庭去访问了解。壶关县委干部访问以后，就发现了许多社员生活上的重要问题。如妇女劳动力全部投入农业生产以后，冬装普遍准备不足，而气候逐渐寒冷，部分地区已开始结冻。显然，这个问题不解决，不仅会影响当前的生产，还要影响社员的健康。
    壶关县干部访问社员家庭是件好事情。自从实现生活集体化以后，有不少干部认为现在家务事情已经很少了，因而也就不再注意去访问社员家庭，不再注意了解和解决社员家庭中的问题。这种认识当然是错误的。生活集体化以后，家庭是起了很大的变化，以户为生产单位的时代已经结束，社员家庭的大部分生活问题也交由集体处理，但是家庭并没有消灭。家庭既然存在，也就必然还有家庭问题。譬如某些社员还没有过冬的燃料或者还没有过冬鞋袜，这不是家庭生活问题吗？这些问题难道不重要吗？
    这种访问，不仅及时解决了社员生活中的问题。而且使一部分干部认识了生活集体化以后，同样要关心社员的生活，这就为今后进一步贯彻党的一手抓生产，一手抓生活奠定了思想基础。
