Boasting is Undesirable

Recently, the Jinzhou Special District Party Committees discovered that in the deep plowing land movement, a few grassroots cadres engaged in deception by reporting shallow plowing as deep plowing and reporting less plowing as more plowing. They promptly combined this with rectification debates to help those cadres recognize their mistakes and correct their shortcomings. This approach is entirely correct.

Cadres who like to boast and be untruthful are actually very few, and some cadres may have made mistakes occasionally. However, if this style is not quickly exposed and criticized, it will harm the Great Leap Forward cause in these areas.

We are materialists, therefore, we emphasize a pragmatic approach. In our work, we never cover up shortcomings or exaggerate achievements. We strive for advancement with a spirit of hard work. Those who love to boast are not like this. These people want to use the least effort to gain the greatest honor, hide shortcomings, falsely report achievements, deceive the masses, and deceive the leadership, thinking they have succeeded. This is purely the trouble making of bourgeois ideology and this boasting style must be prevented and corrected.

    虚夸要不得
    锦州专区各地党委最近发现深翻土地运动中少数基层干部以浅耕报深耕，以少耕报多耕的弄虚作假的现象，并及时结合整风辩论，帮助那些干部认识错误，改正缺点，这个作法是完全正确的。
    喜欢虚夸不实的干部本来是很少的，有些干部也可能是偶尔造成的错误。但是，这种作风如不迅速加以揭发，批判，就会在这些地区给大跃进事业带来危害。
    我们是唯物论者，因此，我们讲求实事求是的作风。在工作中，我们任何时候不掩盖缺点，不夸大成绩。用踏实苦干的精神来力争上游。喜爱虚夸的人却不是如此。这种人想用最小的努力来骗取最大的荣誉，隐瞒缺点，虚报成绩，欺群众，瞒领导，以为得计。这是十足的资产阶级思想在作怪，必须防止和纠正这种虚夸作风。
