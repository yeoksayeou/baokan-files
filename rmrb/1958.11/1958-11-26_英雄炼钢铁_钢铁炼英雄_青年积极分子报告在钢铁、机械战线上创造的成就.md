Xinhua News Agency, November 25th—Youth activists from the "Steel Marshal" and "Machinery Marshal" banners reported their brilliant achievements on the steel and machinery fronts at the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference today. Their speeches were the loudest voices at today's conference. From this, people can see a heroic picture of China's outstanding youth fighting for steel and for machinery.

"How bold the person, how productive the furnace," said Han Xinliang, representative of the youth steelmaking team of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, as the title of his speech. Han Xinliang said boldly in his speech: Our working class's soaring enthusiasm and ingenuity can make the furnace obediently follow our command.

The two open-hearth furnaces in Han Xinliang's workshop were originally built in 1921, and the equipment was so old it was practically toothless. The designed capacity of each furnace was only ten tons of steel per heat. But now, these two ancient open-hearth furnaces have become two "treasure furnaces" under the bold reforms and operations of their young workers and all the workers in the workshop. The furnace output has leaped to forty-five tons, and the smelting time has been shortened to three minutes and fifty-one seconds, creating a high-yield record of a utilization coefficient of 17.045 tons per square meter for small open-hearth furnaces, reaching the advanced world level. In creating these miracles, they always relied on the leadership of the Party and listened to the Party. The Party asked them: "Seize steel from time, not only to increase furnace output, but also to shorten smelting time." They resolutely responded to the Party's call. In order to expand the capacity of the furnace, the three shifts of workers in the entire workshop joined forces in the furnace repair battle. As a result, they finally thinned the furnace walls, raised the furnace roof, and deepened the furnace bottom. In just half a month, the furnace output jumped from the original thirty-four tons to forty-five tons. In order to solve the problem of excessive sulfur and phosphorus and excessively thick steel slag caused by the increase of scrap steel and miscellaneous iron in the raw materials, they also created a "three-step slag discharge method," which allowed the thick steel slag to be discharged in batches, keeping the steel water purer.

Han Xinliang also proposed in his speech that these two open-hearth furnaces should produce more and better steel next year.

From March 28th to October 10th this year, the utilization coefficient of blast furnace ironmaking jumped from 1.731 to 2.894. During this period, it created a new national record ten times and won the national championship five times. This is the remarkable achievement of the young blast furnace workers of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's Ironmaking Plant in their hard work for more than ten months this year. When Liu Xueren, the young furnace foreman and representative of this advanced collective, talked about these gripping figures in his speech today, his tone was full of passion and pride.

Liu Xueren introduced in his speech that they had overcome various conservative ideas and pessimistic arguments in many major debates. With the spirit of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced, they surpassed Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 3 blast furnace twice, Benxi No. 1 Youth Blast Furnace twice, and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's Youth Blast Furnace once. So far, they have always maintained the red flag for the highest record of utilization coefficient of ironmaking blast furnaces. In October, the average utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reached 2.415, reaching the advanced world level. Liu Xueren expressed in his speech that he must never be proud, learn humbly, and, encouraged by this conference, he is determined to act as a heroic vanguard in the national ranks of the greater leap forward in steel next year.

Shi Geng, acting secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Youth League, introduced the situation of Guangxi youth and the people of the entire region fighting steel together and the amazing achievements they have made. He said that out of the four million young people in the autonomous region, 3.2 million young people went to the steel front with high morale. More than one million young people in the region have formed more than 80,000 youth shock teams and established more than 34,000 youth iron-smelting indigenous blast furnaces and more than 780 steelmaking converters. Young people have fully demonstrated the spirit of selfless dedication and high friendship in labor, supporting each other and carrying out large-scale cooperation. 1.9 million young people in the region participated in the steel expedition, climbing mountains and wading through rivers, from this township to that township, from this county to that county, to support the construction of steel bases.

Shi Geng said that all of this shows that this vigorous national steelmaking campaign is a big melting pot for young people, and at the same time as smelting steel and iron, it has tempered and tested the vast number of young people. "Heroes forge steel, steel forges heroes," the title of his speech vividly illustrates this idea.

"The great ocean group is mighty, and the youth of Anshan Iron and Steel fight bravely." Yu Guichen, furnace foreman of the No. 23 open-hearth furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel, used this as the title to introduce to the conference the heroic deeds of the young steel workers fighting day and night in the steel capital to produce 4.5 million tons of steel this year. He said: The youth of Anshan Iron and Steel have played a significant role in the great steel battle this year. With the help of adults and the elderly, the youth of twelve key factories and mines created 1,419 high-yield records in October, which rapidly increased steel production. In June this year, Wang Qingfu, a young steelmaking expert in the unity furnace, created a national large open-hearth furnace record of smelting a furnace of steel in six minutes and twenty seconds. Then, Hou Yingwu, a young steelmaking worker in the No. 16 open-hearth furnace, surpassed him with a record of smelting a furnace of steel in five minutes and forty seconds. The record created by Dai Bingxin, a member of the Communist Youth League in the No. 11 open-hearth furnace, was thirty minutes shorter than his. Yu Guichen said that the youth of Anshan Iron and Steel are not satisfied with these achievements. They want to catch up with others, plant the steel red flag, and be worthy of the glorious title of "Steel Marshal's Throne."

"During the first five-year plan, I completed the work equivalent to eleven years in five years. Since last year, I have been doing the work of 1963!" Liao Shigang, a famous young milling worker from the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, won warm applause from the audience when he talked about these two sentences in his speech at the conference. Liao Shigang said: "The reason why I can achieve such achievements is entirely the result of the training and support of the Party and the collective."

This young worker, who was the first to create a record of one person watching eight machine tools, also talked about how he helped Liu Maojue, a worker in the same workshop, to realize the plan of one person watching ten machine tools, breaking his own record that he had maintained for three years. He said that Liu Maojue has now seen fourteen, and Shang Jiyou, another worker in the same factory, has seen sixteen. Yu Wanlai, who used to work with him and is now in Xi'an, has also seen eleven. He and Liu Maojue have now jointly proposed the target of one person watching twenty machine tools, chasing Shang Jiyou fiercely. Liao Shigang expressed a noble communist spirit of cooperation with these words. He said: "One flower cannot dress up the scenery of spring. A hundred flowers blooming is the beautiful spring. Only by allowing more people to master the advanced level can we accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland."

Although Liao Shigang is famous throughout the country for creating miracles and has received great honor from the Party and the people, he has always used a very humble attitude to describe his achievements in his speech. He recited a poem in his speech entitled "This is Just the Beginning." The poem reads: "I have only made a small achievement, and I have been so cherished by the Party and the people. To tell the truth, this is not surprising. It is the Party's teachings that have made me clear for whom I am working. Please do not over-praise me. I have only taken the first step on a journey of thousands of miles."

The young workers of the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant in Shenyang, who are known throughout the country for "ants gnawing at bones," played an active role in this initiative. Jiang Cunli, deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the factory, spoke at the conference, reporting the vivid deeds of the young people of their factory, together with adult and elderly workers, creating the "ants gnawing at bones" method to make a 182-ton high-pressure nitrogen-hydrogen mixed gas compressor. Among the more than 500 workers who participated in the design work of "ants gnawing at bones," young people accounted for 65%. Luo Chengjian, a female youth designer and member of the Communist Youth League, followed the instructions of the Party, relied on the workers, learned from the workers, and cooperated with the workers. With the help of the workers, she designed seventeen types of nineteen structurally sophisticated special machine tools in just three months, replacing nineteen complex heavy-duty machine tools, opening the first technical hurdle. When casting the large cylinder weighing twelve tons, Xu Wanhua, a young technician with only one year of practical work experience, and the workers of the cylinder group of the foundry department, based on the suggestions of four old workers, used the "split-skin casting method" to break through the difficulty that the largest casting in the factory in the past was only three tons. Finally, the casting task was completed, improving efficiency by one time and achieving 100% quality compared to the past ring casting method. This casting method was praised by Soviet experts as a "Chinese workers' innovation." Wang Jiduo, a member of the Communist Youth League, and thirteen young workers in the Red and Expert Group manufactured a valve lapping machine, producing valve pieces that China could not manufacture in the past, reaching the international level. In this way, due to the joint efforts of the young workers and all the workers, the factory finally completed the task of China's first large-scale nitrogen fertilizer equipment in just three months, reporting good news to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

The youth activists from the steel front who spoke at today's conference also included Feng Chong, the youth representative of the New Steel Research Office of the Metallurgical Industry Department's Iron and Steel Research Institute, who created the new steel "Steel Marshal 80," and Bai Chunxiang, a fourteen-year-old Young Pioneer steel plant workshop director from Luoyang City, Henan Province.

Chen Dechang, a young doctor from Shanghai Guangci Hospital who contributed his wisdom and labor to rescuing steel warrior Qiu Caikang under the leadership of the Party, also spoke at the conference. Qiu Caikang also came to the venue today and met with all the young activists. When he appeared in the center of the venue in a wheelchair, 5,000 young people all stood up and applauded him continuously. Although Qiu Caikang had just recovered his health, he was radiant and spoke in a very loud voice. Qiu Caikang made a brief speech to the young activists at the meeting. He said: "I am an ordinary steel worker. Six months ago, I suffered severe burns at work. It was the beloved Party that saved me. A week ago, I started to be able to walk. I deeply thank the Party and Chairman Mao. The Party is my savior, and my life belongs to the Party forever."

Qiu Caikang said very excitedly at the end: "Although I only have three fingers left, as long as my heart does not stop beating for a day, I must continue to fight on the steel front and contribute all my strength to the great cause of the Party—communism."

After Qiu Caikang's speech, the secretaries of the Central Secretariat of the Communist Youth League, led by Hu Yaobang, stepped down from the rostrum to meet with Qiu Caikang and express their condolences to him. Some representatives of young activists also visited Qiu Caikang after the meeting and took pictures with him.

A total of fourteen young activists spoke at the conference today. Among them were also Sun Ru, deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Cong Wenqi, representative of the youth "combine group" of the Linxi Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine, Zhan Xuejie, a young worker from the Guiyang Blind Bamboo Ware Nail Manufacturing Plant, Hong Shunli, a model militia member of Fujian Province and militia instructor of Xiaodeng Island, and Luo Shuzhen, a deliveryman from the Beijing Post Office.

Today's conference speech started at 9:00 am and ended at 2:50 pm. The conference will continue tomorrow.

    英雄炼钢铁　钢铁炼英雄
    青年积极分子报告在钢铁、机械战线上创造的成就
    新华社25日讯　来自钢铁“元帅”、机械“元帅”两大帅旗下的青年积极分子们，今天在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上，汇报他们在钢铁战线和机械战线上所创造的光辉成就。他们的发言是今天大会发言中最响亮的声音。从这里，人们可以看出我国的优秀青年为钢铁而战和为机械而战的一幅英雄的图景。
    “人有多大胆，炉有多大产”，上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间青年炼钢班代表韩忻亮用这两句话作为他发言的题目。韩忻亮在发言中豪迈地说：我们工人阶级的冲天干劲和巧干精神，可以使炉子乖乖地服从我们的指挥。
    韩忻亮所在车间的两座平炉原来是1921年建造的，设备简直老得没有牙齿，炉产量的设计能力每炉只能产十吨钢。可是现在这两座古老的平炉在他们青年工人和全车间的工人大胆改革和操作下，已经变成了两座“宝炉”，炉产量已经跃进到四十五吨，冶炼时间缩短到三点五十一分。创造了小型平炉利用系数每平方公尺达到一七点零四五吨的高产纪录，达到世界先进水平。在创造这些奇迹中，他们始终依靠了党的领导，听党的话。党向他们提出：“向时间争夺钢水，既要提高炉产量，又要缩短冶炼时间。”他们坚决响应了党的号召。为了扩大炉子的容量，他们全车间三班工人在修炉的战斗中会师作战，结果，终于把炉墙改薄，把炉顶填高，把炉底加深，在短短的半个月中，就使炉产量从原来的三十四吨一下跃进到四十五吨。为了解决原料中增加了废钢杂铁而造成硫磷过多、钢渣太厚的难题，他们还创造了一种“三步放渣法”，使厚厚的钢渣分批放了出来，使钢水保持了更纯的质量。
    韩忻亮在发言中还提出了他们这两座平炉在明年要生产出更多更好的钢。
    从今年3月28日到10月10日，高炉炼铁的利用系数从一点七三一跃进到二点八九四，这期间曾经十次创造了全国新纪录，五次夺得了全国冠军。这是太原钢铁公司炼铁厂青年高炉全体工人今年十个多月来奋战的赫赫战果。当这个先进集体的代表青年高炉炉长刘学仁今天在大会发言中谈到这些紧紧扣人心弦的数字时，他的语调里充满了激情和自豪感。
    刘学仁在发言中介绍了他们在多次大辩论中战胜了各种保守思想和悲观论调，并且以学先进赶先进的精神，两次超过了鞍钢三号高炉。两次超过了本溪一号青年高炉，一次超过了石景山钢铁厂青年高炉，到目前为止，始终保持住炼铁高炉利用系数最高纪录的红旗。10月份高炉平均利用系数达到二·四一五，达到了世界先进水平。刘学仁在他的发言最后表示，一定要永不骄傲，虚心学习，在这次大会的鼓舞下，决心在明年钢铁更大跃进的全民行列中充当英勇的尖兵。
    共青团广西僮族自治区委员会代理书记石更介绍了广西青年和全区人民一起大战钢铁的情况和所取得的惊人成绩。他说，自治区全区四百万青年中，就有三百二十万青年斗志昂扬地奔赴钢铁前线。全区有上百万青年组成了八万多个青年突击队，建立了三万四千多个青年炼铁土高炉，七百八十多个炼钢转炉。青年们在劳动中充分发挥了大公无私舍己为人的高度友爱精神，互相支援，大搞协作。全区有一百九十万青年参加了钢铁远征军，爬山涉水，从这乡到那乡，从这县到那县，支援建设钢铁基地。
    石更说，这一切都说明了这次轰轰烈烈的全民办钢铁的运动，对青年是一个大熔炉，在炼钢炼铁的同时，锻炼和考验了广大青年。“英雄炼钢铁，钢铁炼英雄”，他的这个发言题目生动地说明了这种思想。
    “大洋群威力震天，鞍钢青年英勇奋战”，鞍钢二十三号平炉炉长余贵臣在会上以此为题向大会介绍了战斗在钢都的青年钢铁工人为今年生产四百五十万吨钢而日夜苦战的英雄事迹。他说：鞍钢青年在今年大战钢铁中发挥了显著的作用。十二个重点厂矿的青年在成年、老年人帮助下，10月份共创了一千四百一十九次高产纪录，使钢的产量迅速上升。今年6月，青年团结炉炼钢能手王庆富创造了六点二十分钟炼一炉钢的全国大型平炉纪录，接着十六号平炉青年炼钢工侯英武又以五点四十分钟炼一炉钢的纪录超过了他，而十一号平炉共青团员戴炳信所创造的纪录又比他缩短了三十分钟。余贵臣表示，鞍钢青年并不满足于这些成绩，他们要迎头赶上别人，插上钢铁红旗，要无愧于“钢铁元帅宝座”的光荣称号。
    “在第一个五年计划期间，五年做完了相当于十一年的活，从去年开始我就干1963年的活了！”重庆建设机床厂的著名的青年铣工廖世刚在大会发言中讲到这两句话时，博得了全场热烈的掌声。廖世刚说：“我所以能够达到这样的成就，全是党和集体的培养和支持的结果。”
    这个最先创造了一人看八台机床的纪录的青年工人，还谈到他是怎样帮助同车间的工人刘茂爵实现了一人看十台机床的计划，突破他本人保持了三年的纪录。他说，现在刘茂爵已看到十四台，同厂的另一位工人尚吉友已看到十六台，还有曾和他在一起工作的现在西安的余万来也看到十一台，他和刘茂爵现在又共同提出一人看管二十台机床的指标，猛追尚吉友。廖世刚用这样的话表达了一种高尚的共产主义协作精神。他说：“一朵鲜花打扮不出春天的景色，百花齐放才是美丽的春天，只有让更多的人掌握先进水平，才能加快祖国的社会主义建设。”
    廖世刚虽然以创造了奇迹而在全国闻名，得到了党和人民所给予的很大的荣誉，但是他在发言里自始至终都是用非常谦虚的态度来叙述他的成就。他在发言里念了一首诗，题目是“这才是开始”。诗里写道：“我只作出一点渺小的成绩，就受到党和人民这样的珍视。说真话，这并不值得惊异，是党的教导使我明确了为谁劳动；请不要对我过分的夸奖，万里行程我才跨出了第一步。”
    以“蚂蚁啃骨头”而闻名全国的沈阳市东北机器制造厂的青年职工，在这一创举中发挥了积极作用。这个厂的共青团团委副书记蒋存礼在大会上发言，汇报了他们厂的青年们和成年、老年职工一道，创造出“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，制成一台一百八十二吨重的高压氮氢混合气体压缩机的生动事迹。在参加“蚂蚁啃骨头”的设计工作的五百多名工人中，青年占65％。女青年设计人员共青团员罗诚鉴按照党的指示，依靠工人，向工人学习，并和工人合作，在工人帮助下，只用了三个月的时间，就设计出十七种共十九台结构精巧的专用机床，代替了十九台复杂的重型大机床，打开了第一道技术关。在铸造重达十二吨的大汽缸时，只有一年实际工作经验的青年技术员徐婉华和铸工部汽缸小组的工人们一起，根据四名老工人的提议，用“裂皮铸造法”突破了这个厂过去最大铸件只不过三吨重的困难，终于完成了铸造任务，比过去用套圈铸造法提高效率一倍，质量达到100％。这种铸造法被苏联专家称赞为“中国工人创举”。共青团员王吉多和红专小组的十三名青年工人制造出了阀片研磨机，生产出我国过去不能制造的阀片，达到了国际水平。就这样，由于青年工人和全体工人的共同努力，这个厂终于只用了三个月的时间完成了我国第一台大型氮肥设备的任务，向党中央和毛主席报捷。
    在今天大会上发言的来自钢铁战线的青年积极分子，还有冶金工业部钢铁研究院新钢种研究室创造出新钢种“钢帅80”的青年代表冯冲和河南省洛阳市红领巾钢厂车间主任十四岁的少先队员白春祥。
    在党的领导下为抢救钢铁战士丘财康而贡献出自己的智慧和劳动的上海广慈医院青年医生陈德昌，也在大会上发了言。丘财康今天也来到了会场，并和全体青年积极分子见了面。当他坐着手推车出现在会场的中央时，五千名青年都一起站立起来，不住地向他鼓掌。丘财康虽然刚刚恢复健康，但是神采奕奕，讲起话来声音非常宏亮。丘财康在会上向青年积极分子们作了简短的发言。他说：“我是一个普通的炼钢工人。六个月前，在工作时受了严重的烫伤，是亲爱的党救活了我。一星期前，我开始能够走路了。我深深地感谢党，感谢毛主席。党是我的救命恩人，我的生命是永远属于党的。”
    丘财康最后非常激动地说：“我虽然只剩下三个手指，但是只要我的心脏一天不停止跳动，我一定要继续战斗在钢铁战线上，一定要为党的伟大事业——共产主义，贡献全部的力量。”
    在丘财康讲话以后，以胡耀邦为首的共青团中央书记处的书记们走下主席台，同丘财康见面，向他表示慰问。一些青年积极分子代表也在会后访问了丘财康，并同他在一起照了像。
    今天在大会上发言的青年积极分子一共有十四人。他们之中还有长春第一汽车制造厂共青团团委副书记孙儒，开滦煤矿林西矿青年“康拜因小组”代表丛文起，贵阳市盲人竹器洋钉制造厂青年工人詹学杰，福建省民兵模范、小嶝岛民兵指导员洪顺利，北京邮局投递员罗淑珍。
    今天的大会发言从上午九时开始，到下午二时五十分结束。明天大会将继续进行。
