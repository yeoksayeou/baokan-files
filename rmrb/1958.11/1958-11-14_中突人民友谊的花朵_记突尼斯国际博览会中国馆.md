    The Flower of Friendship Between the Chinese and Tunisian People
    ——A Record of the Chinese Pavilion at the Tunis International Fair
    Zeng Fan
    This year is the first time China has participated in the Tunis International Fair. This has been the wish of the Tunisian people for several years. Since 1955, the Tunisian people have hoped that the new China would participate in the exhibition at the fair. This autumn, when the broad masses of the Tunisian people learned that China had decided to participate in the Tunis International Fair, they felt boundless joy and excitement. Their wish of many years could be realized.
      The Center of Attraction for Visitors
    "Do you know that China is participating in our fair this year?" "Personnel from the Chinese delegation have already arrived in Tunis." When the first group of the exhibition delegation arrived in Tunisia, these messages spread among the people. While the Chinese pavilion was still being renovated and decorated, many people often stopped in front of the pavilion to look around, or asked about the exhibition content with great interest. At this time, people had new material for conversation everywhere: "The Chinese pavilion will exhibit many new-style machines." "The Chinese pavilion is the largest exhibition hall in the fair." "The exhibits in the Chinese pavilion are very rich." The fair opened, and people flocked to the venue, but for many visitors, the first thing they did was enter the Chinese pavilion for a visit, even though the Chinese pavilion was not near the entrance of the fair.
    The Chinese pavilion was decorated with a palace-style gate, and the national flags of China and Tunisia fluttered in the wind. On both sides of the pavilion walls hung ten colorful decorative paintings, 2.7 meters in diameter, depicting the Great Leap Forward in Chinese industrial and agricultural production. The front of the pavilion was lush with flowers and plants, complementing the palace gate in the national style, making the Chinese pavilion even more beautiful. This place, from beginning to end, was the center of attraction for visitors to this year's Tunis International Fair.
            Praise, Friendship, Trade
    On the first day of the opening, Tunisian government leaders, headed by President Bourguiba, visited the Chinese pavilion. They were most interested in the various new-style machines on display, the model of the Yangtze River Bridge, and the photographs of China's first atomic reactor. After the visit, President Bourguiba wrote in the guestbook: "I am very pleased to see everything in the People's China Exhibition Hall. I warmly congratulate this great achievement."
    On the Chinese Pavilion Day, Tunisian Minister of Commerce and Industry Abassi carefully reviewed all the exhibits displayed in the Chinese pavilion. He said that he was an engineer, and he could see that the manufacturing technology of the various ball bearings, cutter gears, etc., exhibited by us was very complex. His evaluation of the Chinese pavilion was: "The Chinese pavilion is the best exhibition hall at the fair, and the machines on display are the newest. This is a true reflection of the actual situation in the new China."
    Many visitors wrote such feelings in the opinion book: "After visiting the Chinese pavilion, I realized the amazing progress made by the Chinese people in the short period after liberation. China's industrial technology has given me a strong impression. I hope that our beloved people can also realize the same ideal." I have repeatedly heard visitors and friends say to us: "People everywhere are praising the Chinese pavilion as the most beautiful exhibition hall at the fair." "Congratulations on the great success of your exhibition." They said: "The success of your exhibition is not only the pride of the Chinese people, but also the pride of the Tunisian people, because in the past, Western imperialists always slandered our Asian and African countries as backward and uncultured; but the exhibition of the Chinese pavilion has powerfully shattered their lies."
    The various Chinese commodities sold in the Chinese pavilion's small shop added a lot of attraction to the vast number of visitors. As early as before the opening of the fair, people kept inquiring about the news of the Chinese pavilion's small sales items. Since the small shop started operating, it has always been the busiest and most crowded place. When they waited in line for a long time and bought a little Chinese merchandise, they felt great excitement and joy. The Tunisian people believe that: "These Chinese goods are not only beautiful and practical, but also very cheap. This is the friendship and souvenir that the Chinese people bring to the Tunisian people." Local manufacturers have come to negotiate transactions with representatives of our various trade companies and sign contracts.
            Let the Flowers of Friendship Bloom
    The Tunisian friends who assisted the Chinese pavilion were so serious in guarding the exhibition, so carefully taking care of the exhibits, so enthusiastic and actively supporting all our work. This is also one of the important reasons for the success of the exhibition. For example, a transportation worker, in order to strive for the exhibition to be held on schedule, transported exhibits for us day and night. He said: "I will do my best to work for the Chinese pavilion. I want to leave a good memory for the Chinese people in my work." The manager of a woodworking factory personally led the workers to rush to install the exhibition hall gate overnight in order to catch up with the installation, although he was so tired that his voice was hoarse and his legs could hardly support him, he still persevered to the end. A flower factory felt extremely excited after accepting the work of cultivating flowers and plants for the Chinese pavilion. The owner and technicians of the factory said: "We must decorate the Chinese pavilion more beautifully so that the friendship between our Chinese and Tunisian people will be as flourishing as these flowers and plants." These are just a few examples among countless facts. When many Tunisian people heard us call them the best friends, they immediately stretched out two fingers side by side and said: "We are not only good friends, but also good brothers."

    中突人民友谊的花朵
    ——记突尼斯国际博览会中国馆
    曾凡
    中国今年是第一次参加了突尼斯国际博览会。这是突尼斯人民几年来的愿望。打从1955年起，突尼斯人民就希望新中国参加博览会展出。今年秋天广大突尼斯人民知道中国决定参加突尼斯国际博览会后，感到无比的欢欣和兴奋。他们几年来的愿望可以实现了。
      吸引观众的中心
    “您们知道中国今年要参加我们的博览会吗？”“中国代表团的人员已经来到突尼斯了。”当展览团首批人员抵突后，这些消息便在人群中传开了。中国馆还在改装、布置的时候，许多人常常停留在馆前探望，或者很感兴趣地询问展览内容。这时人们在各处的谈话又有了新的材料：“中国馆将展出许多新式机器。”“中国展览馆是博览会中最大的展览馆。”“中国馆展品内容是十分丰富的。”博览会开幕了，人们源源不断地来到会场，然而许多观众的第一个节目便是进入中国馆参观，尽管中国馆并不是靠近博览会入口的地方。
    中国展览馆装饰了宫殿式的大门，中突两国国旗迎风飘扬。两侧馆墙上悬挂着表现中国工农业生产大跃进的直径二点七公尺的十幅彩色装饰画，馆前花草繁茂，陪衬着民族形式的宫殿大门，把中国馆打扮得更加美丽。这个地方，自始至终是今年突尼斯国际博览会吸引观众的中心。
            赞美、友谊、贸易
    开幕的第一天，以布尔吉巴总统为首的突尼斯政府领导人参观了中国馆。他们对展出的各种新式机器、长江大桥模型以及我国第一个原子反应堆照片最感兴趣。参观后，布尔吉巴总统在留言簿上写道：“在人民中国展览馆里见到的一切使我十分高兴。我热烈祝贺这个伟大的成就。”
    在中国馆馆日，突工商部长阿巴西又把中国馆展出的全部展品仔细地看了一遍。他说，他是一个工程师，他可以看出，我们展出的各种滚珠轴承、刀具齿轮等的制造技术都是很复杂的。他对中国馆的评价是：“中国馆是博览会上最好的展览馆，展出的机器都是最新式的。这是真正反映新中国实况的展出。”
    许多观众都在意见簿上写上这样的感想：“参观中国馆后，使我认识到中国人民在获得解放后的短短时期里所取得的惊人进步。中国的工业技术给予我强烈印象，希望我们可爱的人民也能实现同样的理想。”我曾一再地听到观众和朋友们对我们表示：“人们到处都在称道中国馆是博览会中最美好的展览馆。”“祝贺您们展出的巨大成功。”他们说：“您们展出的成功，不仅是中国人民的骄傲，而且也是突尼斯人民的骄傲，因为过去西方帝国主义者总是诬蔑我们亚非国家是落后的，没有文化的；但是中国馆的展出却有力地粉碎了他们的谰言。”
    中国馆小卖部出售的各种中国商品，更对广大观众增加了不少吸力。早在博览会开幕前，人们就不断打听着中国馆小卖品的消息。小卖部自从开始营业以来，一直是最热闹最拥挤的地方。当他们经过长时排队等待而买到了一点中国商品后，都感到很大的兴奋和喜悦。突尼斯人民认为：“这些中国商品不仅美观、实用，而且价钱十分低廉，这是中国人民带给突尼斯人民的友谊与纪念。”当地厂商都纷纷前来与我国各贸易公司代表接洽交易，签订合同。
            让友谊的鲜花开放
    协助中国馆工作的突尼斯朋友们，他们是那么认真地看守着展览，那么仔细地照管着展品，那么热情洋溢，积极主动地支援我们的一切工作。这也是展览成功的重要原因之一。譬如有一个运输工人，为了争取如期展出，日以继夜地为我们搬运展品，他说：“我要尽最大力量为中国馆工作，我要在工作中给中国人民留下很好的记忆。”木工厂经理为了赶装展览馆大门，亲自带领连夜赶工，虽然他疲乏得声音发哑，两腿都几乎不能支持了，仍然坚持到底。一家花厂接受了为中国馆培植花草的工作后，感到无比兴奋。这厂的主人和技师说：“我们一定好好地把中国馆打扮得更加美丽，让我们中突人民的友谊像这些花草一样的繁茂。”这只不过是无数事实中的几个例子而已。许多突尼斯人民当听到我们称他们是最好的朋友时，马上伸出两个指头并列着说：“我们不仅是好朋友，而且是好兄弟。”（附图片）
