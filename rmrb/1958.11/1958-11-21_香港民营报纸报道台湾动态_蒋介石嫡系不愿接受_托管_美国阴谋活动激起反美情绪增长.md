Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th - Hong Kong's privately owned newspaper, "New Evening Post," recently reported a conversation with someone close to Taiwan, saying, "Chiang Kai-shek has recently been gradually understanding that the U.S.'s approach to Taiwan's future is not something he can accept."

	This person said, "Chiang Kai-shek had heard about the U.S.'s attempt to resolve Taiwan's future status using a 'United Nations Trusteeship' approach. When Dulles visited Taipei, Chiang questioned him about it. Dulles quickly denied it and agreed to increase U.S. aid starting next year to assist in the development of Taiwan's industry and agriculture."

	This person, familiar with the internal situation in Taiwan, said, "However, the U.S., on the other hand, is working hard on certain pro-American and influential figures in Taiwan, seeking their opinions on the 'trusteeship' approach. I heard that a certain senior Taiwanese diplomat even echoed this sentiment. But Chiang's inner circle and military leaders strongly opposed it. They repeatedly stated that this American approach is a great insult to the Kuomintang. If this is the U.S.'s expression of 'concern,' then the 'friendship' that the U.S. government constantly talks about is just another name for weakening the Kuomintang's power.

	"As for Taiwan's press and the general public, they are strongly opposed to 'United Nations Trusteeship' and other similar approaches. Of course, some people believe that under the current circumstances, if a 'popular vote' is held, the Kuomintang would still be able to control the vote count. But others don't think so. Their view is that since the U.S. has 'United Nations Trusteeship' as its goal, it will definitely make arrangements and plans regarding the voting aspect. Furthermore, the anti-American sentiment among the Taiwanese people is increasing, and it is not impossible that even the U.S. or the Kuomintang would be unable to control the situation during the voting."

	This person concluded, "Under these circumstances, 'United Nations Trusteeship' or similar approaches, no matter what methods the U.S. uses to carry them out, will be firmly opposed by Chiang Kai-shek."

	The privately owned "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" reported on the 18th a conversation with a well-informed source close to Taipei officials, saying that in Taipei, "The Kuomintang has recently been under increasing pressure from Washington to prevent any reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It is said that U.S. military officials recently made repeated suggestions of this kind during their contact with Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei."

	This person said, "Some American figures are concerned that due to the increasing anti-American sentiment within the Kuomintang, the sentiment for Kuomintang-Communist reconciliation is also increasing, especially among the middle and lower-level Kuomintang members."

    香港民营报纸报道台湾动态
    蒋介石嫡系不愿接受“托管”
    美国阴谋活动激起反美情绪增长
    新华社香港20日电　香港民营报纸“新晚报”最近报道一个接近台湾方面的人士的谈话说，“蒋介石最近正渐渐了解，美国对于台湾前途的一套做法，不是他所能接受的。”
    这位人士说，“关于美国拟用
  ‘联合国托管’方式来解决台湾未来地位的企图，蒋介石早有所闻。杜勒斯访台北时，蒋曾向他提出了质问。杜勒斯连忙加以否认，并允许于明年度起，增拨一些美援，协助台湾工农业的发展。”
    这个熟悉台湾内部情况的人士说，“可是，美国在另一方面，却正对台湾某些亲美的有力分子大做功夫，征询他们对‘托管’这种做法的意见。我听说，台湾某高级外交官竟然也随声附和。但蒋的嫡系和军事领袖们却大力反对。他们一再表明，美国这种做法对国民党是个极大的侮辱。如果这就是美国
  ‘关怀’的表现，那么美国政府口口声声所说的‘友谊’只是削弱国民党力量的另一名辞。
      “至于台湾报界和一般公众，更是十分反对‘联合国托管’和其他类似的做法。当然，有一部分人认为，在目前情况下，如果举行‘民意投票’，国民党还是有办法控制票数的。但另一部分人可不这样想，他们的看法是：美国既以‘联合国托管’为目标，那么在投票这一方面，一定也会加以布置、安排。还有，台湾老百姓的反美情绪正有增无已，甚至在投票时发生美国或国民党都不能控制的局面，也不是不可能的。”
    这位人士最后说，“在这种情形下，‘联合国托管’这一类方式，不论美国用什么手法来进行，都要遭到蒋介石的坚决反对。”
    民营的“香港商报”18日报道了一个接近台北官方的消息灵通人士的谈话说，在台北，“国民党最近已受到华盛顿方面越来越大的压力，想阻止国共之间有任何和解的局面出现。据说，美军要员最近在台北与蒋介石的接触中，就曾一再作出过这种暗示。”
    这位人士说，“某些美国人士疑虑，由于国民党内部反美情绪的增加，国共和解的情绪事实上也在增加之中，特别是在中下层国民党人士之间。”
