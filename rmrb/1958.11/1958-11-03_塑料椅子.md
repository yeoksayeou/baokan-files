    Plastic Chair
    The Tianjin Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station and the Tianjin No. 1 Woodworking Production Cooperative have jointly produced a plastic chair with a beautiful design and easy to move, using polyvinyl chloride artificial leather and hard pipes. This chair is soft and elastic, and the polyvinyl chloride hard pipes are not afraid of water, so they are more sturdy and durable than wooden chairs. (Dong Zhimin) (with picture)

    塑料椅子
    天津百货采购供应站和天津第一木器生产社合作，用聚氯乙烯人造革和硬管，制成一种式样美观，搬动轻便的塑料椅子。这种椅子柔软有弹力，聚氯乙烯硬管不怕水，所以较木制的椅子坚固耐用。（董智敏）（附图片）
