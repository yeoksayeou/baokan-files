    The government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, led by Premier Kim Il-sung, arrived in Beijing today for a friendly visit to our country at the invitation of our government. Our government and all the people of our country express their warm welcome and heartfelt respect to the Korean people's beloved leader and other distinguished Korean guests with unparalleled excitement. Premier Kim Il-sung visited our country twice in 1953 and 1954, making significant contributions to the development and strengthening of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Korea. This visit by the Korean government delegation headed by Premier Kim Il-sung will further develop and consolidate the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Korea. This is another major event in the political life of the people of China and Korea.
    The ever-flowing Yalu River connects our two countries, and the common struggle against imperialist aggression has made the people of our two countries share life and death, and share weal and woe. We are neighbors as close as lips and teeth, and we are brothers as close as hands and feet. The friendship between the people of China and Korea is a fighting friendship that has been tested in a long period of common struggle. The Chinese people will never forget that in the flames of the Northern Expedition, on the Long March, in the arduous years of resisting Japanese aggression, and in the victorious march to overthrow the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people fought side by side with the Chinese people, not hesitating to sacrifice their lives to assist the Chinese revolution and the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. The traditional friendship between the people of China and Korea has been further developed in the common struggle against American imperialist aggression. The Korean people bravely resisted and repelled the most ferocious imperialist aggressors in the world, which not only defended the independence and freedom of their own country, but also protected China's security and provided significant support for China's socialist construction. During the period when the Chinese People's Volunteers fought alongside the Korean people against American aggression and after the armistice helped Korea maintain the armistice agreement and rebuild their homeland, they received meticulous care from the Korean people, the Korean Workers' Party, and the Korean government. When the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew to their country, they were warmly seen off by the entire Korean people. These moving deeds fully embody the great friendship between the people of China and Korea cemented with blood, and the great internationalist spirit of the Korean people. The Chinese people will always cherish and always be grateful for this deep friendship.
    In the past few years, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Korea have been comprehensively developed. It has been five years since the signing of the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement between China and Korea on November 23, 1953. Over the past five years, economic cooperation between China and Korea has become increasingly close. The volume of trade between China and Korea has increased rapidly, and the volume of trade between the two countries in 1958 has increased tenfold compared with 1954. In September of this year, China and Korea signed a long-term trade agreement for 1959-1962 and an agreement on the Chinese government providing two loans to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and made a decision on China and Korea jointly investing in the construction of the Yunfeng Hydropower Station. The signing of these agreements marks a new stage in the long-term cooperation of economic cooperation between China and Korea. In the past few years, cultural cooperation between China and Korea has also been developing continuously. The frequent friendly exchanges between the governments and people of China and Korea are a clear sign of the development of the fraternal friendship between our two countries. This year, the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese people's delegation headed by President Guo Moruo visited Korea and were warmly welcomed by the Korean government and people. This year, our government and people also warmly welcomed the Korean government delegation headed by Vice Premier Li Zhouyuan and the Korean people's delegation to China headed by Minister of Justice Xu Zhenshu. At the same time as the Korean government delegation visited our country, the Korean military delegation and the Korean art troupe also came to our country for friendly visits. The continuous development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Korea will inevitably greatly promote the socialist construction of China and Korea and will continue to strengthen the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The Korean people are a hardworking and brave people. In the struggle to defend and build the motherland, the Korean people have shown unparalleled heroism and a firm confidence in victory. The barbaric aggression of the imperialists had caused extremely serious damage to the Korean people. However, the Korean people did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, and with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, they almost rebuilt their motherland and homeland from the ruins. Today, we are excited to see that heroic Korea, like a phoenix reborn from the flames, stands proudly in the east of the world, appearing more beautiful and stronger. In the short period after the war, the Korean people have successfully completed the three-year plan for restoring and building the people's economy, and have begun to implement the first five-year plan for developing the people's economy (1957-1961). Now, the Korean people are "riding on the Chollima" and advancing rapidly on the road of socialism. The Korean people's large-scale development of local industry has been very effective. In the first nine months of this year, Korea's total industrial output value increased by 34% compared with the same period last year. Korea's agricultural cooperation has been successfully completed. This year, Korea's grain and cotton have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. At the same time, Korea's culture and education have also developed accordingly, and people's lives have been continuously improved. Premier Kim Il-sung recently pointed out that Korea will reach the production level stipulated at the end of the five-year plan (1961) next year. Now, the Korean people are working hard to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule. The great achievements made by the glorious Korean people in the cause of building the motherland eloquently prove to the world that a nation that has been liberated and armed with Marxist-Leninist ideology is invincible, and no force can stop them from heading towards the bright road of socialism and communism.
    The Korean people are a peace-loving people. They eagerly hope to unify the three thousand miles of their motherland as soon as possible and live a peaceful and free life without foreign interference. For more than five years since the Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently strictly abided by the armistice agreement and have done everything possible to promote an early peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, the American aggressors have continuously violated the armistice agreement, illegally shipped new weapons into South Korea, and established missile bases in southern Korea. Now, the Chinese People's Volunteers, in response to the suggestions of the Korean and Chinese governments, have all withdrawn from Korea. This proactive measure is a major step in promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea and easing international tensions. However, the invading troops of the United States and its vassal states are still stubbornly staying in South Korea. Recently, the United States has once again colluded with its vassal states to pass the so-called "Thirteen-Nation Proposal" in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to continue to cover up its refusal to withdraw its troops from South Korea. The people of the world can see more clearly: who is obstructing and continuing to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Chinese people firmly support the Korean people's desire for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and firmly oppose the United States' occupation of South Korea and turning it into an American military base and colony. The Chinese People's Volunteers have solemnly declared to the world: "If American imperialism and its followers dare to destroy the dignity of the Korean armistice agreement and launch another war of aggression against Korea, then as long as the Korean people and the Korean government deem it necessary, the Chinese people will not hesitate to send their outstanding sons and daughters again to cross the Yalu River and fight together with the Korean People's Army to crush the enemy's aggression." We firmly believe that the three thousand miles of Korea will be peacefully reunified, and the Korean people's just struggle will surely be victorious!
    The American imperialist aggressors not only occupy the territory of southern Korea, but also occupy our territory of Taiwan. The military provocations and war threats against our people by American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area have been shamefully defeated and have placed themselves in an unprecedentedly isolated position. However, it continues to adopt a hostile policy of aggression and war against the Chinese people, and recently has openly engaged in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas". The Korean government and the Korean people firmly support the Chinese people's just struggle to defend the territory of their motherland, and we express our deep gratitude. American imperialism should remember that it was the armies of China and Korea that repelled the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield and exposed the American paper tiger. Today, the people of China and Korea have more confidence and strength to smash any aggressive and adventurous actions of American imperialism.
    At the moment when the Korean government delegation headed by Premier Kim Il-sung arrives in our country for a friendly visit, we sincerely congratulate the socialist construction of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on its rapid progress, wish the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Korea will last forever, and wish the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will become increasingly strong.

    欢迎以金日成首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团
    应我国政府邀请前来我国进行友好访问的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团，在金日成首相的率领下，今天到达北京。我国政府和我国全体人民，以无比兴奋的心情，对朝鲜人民爱戴的领袖和其他朝鲜贵宾们的到来，表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。金日成首相在1953年和1954年曾两次访问我国，对发展和加强中朝两国的友好合作关系作出了重大的贡献。这次以金日成首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团的访问，必将使中朝两国的友好合作关系获得进一步的发展和巩固。这是中朝两国人民政治生活中的又一件大事。
    永流不息的鸭绿江把我们两个国家连在一起，反对帝国主义侵略的共同斗争使我们两国人民同生死、共患难。我们是唇齿相依的邻邦，我们是亲如手足的兄弟。中朝两国人民的友谊是在长期的共同斗争中历经考验的战斗友谊。中国人民永远不会忘记：在北伐的战火中，在长征的道路上，在反抗日本侵略的艰苦岁月里，在推翻蒋介石统治的胜利进军中，朝鲜人民的优秀儿女同中国人民一起并肩战斗，不惜牺牲自己的生命来援助中国革命和中国人民的解放事业。中朝两国人民的传统友谊，在反对美帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中又得到了新的发展。朝鲜人民英勇地反抗并击退了世界上最凶恶的帝国主义侵略者，这不仅捍卫了自己国家的独立自由，而且也保卫了中国的安全，给予中国人民的社会主义建设以重大的支援。中国人民志愿军在同朝鲜人民一起抗击美国侵略时期和在停战以后协助朝鲜维护停战协定和重建家园时期，都受到朝鲜人民、朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜政府的无微不至的关怀。中国人民志愿军在撤退回国的时候，更受到了朝鲜全体人民的热情欢送。这些动人的事迹，充分体现了中朝两国人民之间由鲜血凝成的伟大友谊，和朝鲜人民的伟大的国际主义精神。中国人民将永远珍惜、永远感激这种深情厚谊。
    几年来，中朝两国的友好合作关系有了全面的发展。自从1953年11月23日中朝两国签订了经济及文化合作协定以来，整整五年了。五年来，中朝两国在经济上的合作越来越密切。中朝两国贸易额迅速增长，1958年两国贸易额已比1954年增加了十倍。今年9月间，中朝两国又签订了1959年—1962年长期贸易协定和中国政府向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提供两项贷款的协定，并且就中朝两国共同投资兴建云丰水电站作出了决定。这些协定的签订标志着中朝两国经济合作进入了长期合作的新阶段。几年来，中朝两国的文化合作关系也在不断发展。中朝两国政府之间和人民之间友好往来的频繁是我们两国兄弟友谊发展的鲜明标志。今年以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团和以郭沫若院长为首的中国人民代表团访问了朝鲜，受到朝鲜政府和人民的热烈欢迎。今年我国政府和人民也热烈欢迎了以李周渊副首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团和以许贞淑司法相为首的朝鲜人民访华代表团。在这次朝鲜政府代表团访问我国的同时，朝鲜军事代表团和朝鲜艺术团也前来我国进行友好访问。中朝两国友好合作关系的不断发展必然将大大促进中朝两国的社会主义建设事业，将继续加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。
    朝鲜人民是勤劳而勇敢的人民。在保卫和建设祖国的斗争中，朝鲜人民都表现出无比的英雄气概和坚强的胜利信心。帝国主义者的野蛮侵略曾使朝鲜人民遭受到极其严重的破坏。然而，朝鲜人民丝毫没有在困难面前低头。他们在朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相的领导下，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支援下，几乎是从废墟上重建祖国和家园。今天，我们兴奋地看到，英雄的朝鲜有如从烈火中再生的凤凰，昂然站立在世界的东方，显得更加美丽，更加劲强了。在战后短短的时期中，朝鲜人民已胜利地完成了恢复和建设人民经济的三年计划，并且开始实行发展人民经济的第一个五年计划（1957年—1961年）。现在，朝鲜人民正“跨上千里马”，在社会主义的道路上加鞭猛进。朝鲜全民大办地方工业已经大见成效。今年头九个月朝鲜工业总产值比去年同期增加了34％。朝鲜农业合作化已胜利完成。今年朝鲜的粮食和棉花都获得了空前未有的大丰收。同时，朝鲜的文化教育也相应发展，人民生活不断提高。金日成首相最近指出，朝鲜将在明年达到规定在五年计划结束时（1961年）达到的生产水平。现在，朝鲜人民正努力争取提前完成第一个五年计划。光荣的朝鲜人民在建设祖国的事业中所取得的巨大成就，向全世界雄辩地证明，一个获得了解放的、用马克思列宁主义思想武装起来的民族是不可战胜的，任何力量也不能挡住他们奔向社会主义和共产主义的光明大道。
    朝鲜人民是酷爱和平的人民。他们殷切企望早日统一祖国的三千里江山，过着不受外国干涉的和平自由的生活。朝鲜停战五年多来，朝中方面一贯严格遵守停战协定，并竭尽一切努力促使早日和平解决朝鲜问题。然而，美国侵略者却不断破坏停战协定，非法向南朝鲜运入新式武器，在朝鲜南部建立导弹基地。现在，中国人民志愿军响应朝中两国政府的建议，已经全部撤离朝鲜。这一主动措施，是促进朝鲜和平统一、缓和国际紧张局势的一个重大步骤。但是，美国及其仆从国家的侵略军却仍然赖在南朝鲜不走。最近美国又纠集仆从国家在联合国大会政治委员会上通过所谓“十三国提案”，继续为抗拒从南朝鲜撤军进行掩饰。全世界人民可以看得更清楚：究竟是谁阻挠了而且继续阻挠着朝鲜问题的和平解决。中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的愿望，坚决反对美国霸占南朝鲜并把它变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。中国人民志愿军已向全世界庄严声明：“如果美帝国主义和它的追随者胆敢破坏朝鲜停战协定的尊严，再一次发动侵朝战争，那时只要朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府认为需要，中国人民将会毫不迟疑地派出自己的优秀儿女，再一次跨过鸭绿江来，同朝鲜人民军一起为粉碎敌人的侵犯而共同战斗。”我们深信，朝鲜的三千里江山一定会和平统一，朝鲜人民的正义斗争一定会获得胜利！
    美帝国主义侵略者不仅霸占着朝鲜南部的国土，而且也霸占着我国领土台湾。美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对我国人民进行的军事挑衅和战争威胁，已遭到可耻的失败，并使自己陷于空前孤立的地位。但是，它仍然继续采取敌视中国人民的侵略政策和战争政策，最近更公开进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋。朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民坚决支持中国人民捍卫祖国领土的正义斗争，我们深表感激。美帝国主义应该记得，正是朝中两国军队在朝鲜战场上击退了美国侵略者，戳穿了美国纸老虎。今天，中朝人民更有信心和力量粉碎美帝国主义的任何侵略冒险行动。
    当以金日成首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团到达我国进行友好访问的时刻，我们衷心地祝贺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的社会主义建设一日千里，祝中朝两国人民的兄弟友谊万古长青，祝以苏联为首的社会主义阵营日益强大。
