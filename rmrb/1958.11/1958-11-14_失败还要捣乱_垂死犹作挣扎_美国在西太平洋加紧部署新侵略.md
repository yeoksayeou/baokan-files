　　Failure Still Leads to Trouble, A Dying Struggle
　　The United States Intensifies Deployment of New Aggressions in the Western Pacific
　　Actively Creating Two Chinas
　　Trying Hard to Piece Together an Aggressive Chain
　　Driving Japan to Act as a Lackey
　　Plotting Military Coups Everywhere
　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th – While openly promoting the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," the United States is nervously piecing together its chain of aggression in the Western Pacific.

　　This is a redeployment being carried out by American war instigators after their recent defeat in the Taiwan Strait area. The United States' playing of the brinkmanship game this time, in the face of the powerful Chinese people, has placed it in a position of extreme isolation, more unpopular than its invasion of the Middle East not long ago. Apart from Nobusuke Kishi and Syngman Rhee, dozens of other countries allied with the United States have stood idly by, and the set of military group formations that the United States has painstakingly cultivated for a long time has become paralyzed, exposing the paper tiger for what it is. Therefore, at present, the United States is trying its best to reverse this decline, and is trying its best to strengthen its control over its Western Pacific "allies" in order to drive them to serve the aggressive policies of the United States.

　　This intention of the United States is first manifested in the negotiations between the United States and Japan to revise the US-Japan "Security Treaty." The United States not only wants to permanently occupy Japan in the name of "defending Japan," but the United States has also proposed to expand the US-Japan "joint defense area" to other areas in the Western Pacific in the revised treaty. Nobusuke Kishi has also repeatedly stated publicly that Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands under US occupation should be included in the "joint defense area." Whether it includes the entire Western Pacific or Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, it will de facto form the "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization" that the United States has been planning for a long time, because Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands already belong to the "joint defense" scope stipulated by the "bilateral treaties" between the United States and Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek.

　　Not only that, the United States is also seeking "international guarantees" with more countries participating for its conspiracy to create "two Chinas." The "New York Times," which often reflects the intentions of American power holders, mentioned this point in an editorial on October 16. It said that the United States should "invite the governments of Australia and New Zealand and other Pacific countries to join us in guaranteeing the defense of Taiwan." The "Business Week" of the United States reported in early November that "Dulles' current goal" is to make Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines "guarantee the defense of Formosa (Taiwan) together with the United States," and sooner or later include other countries as well. The United States is precisely using this kind of "guarantee" as a means of connecting its chain of aggression in the Western Pacific.

　　Naturally, the United States has especially favored Japan in choosing its aggressive pawns in the Far East. To let Asians fight Asians, to let Japanese militarists become the main accomplices of the United States in the Western Pacific for aggression and expansion, this is what the United States is trying to wrest from the Nobusuke Kishi government in the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty." And in this regard, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi is also eager to try, clamoring to abolish the Japanese constitutional clause prohibiting the dispatch of troops abroad, and "cooperate with the United States in every possible way." Nobusuke Kishi, who is reviving the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," blatantly expressed his intention to expand into Southeast Asia and get involved in Korea and Taiwan in an interview with American journalist Brown.

　　The Kishi Nobusuke government's "cooperation" with the United States in this way has exposed the ambition of Japanese imperialists. Similarly, the United States' need for this experienced guide, Japan, also exposes the American imperialists themselves. Isn't American imperialism following the old path of Japanese imperialism's aggression in the Western Pacific? The Chinese people will not forget how Japan first occupied Taiwan and then attacked the Chinese mainland. The people of Southeast Asian countries will not forget how Japan "advanced southward" to expand its "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Therefore, the collusion between the United States and Japan in the Western Pacific is not only a threat to the Chinese people, but also a threat to the people of Asian countries. Imperialism always attacks where it considers to be a weak point. The American and Japanese imperialists will know that the copper walls and iron ramparts of the People's China today are not easy to touch. Under the slogan of "anti-communism," they will actually point the spearhead of aggression toward the road of "southward advance."

　　The allies that are being used by the United States as links in the chain will bear the brunt. Recently, the United States has been intensifying its control over them. Since August, American military personnel have been visiting Asian allies particularly frequently, with US Secretary of the Army Brucker, Secretary of Defense McElroy, and Army Chief of Staff Taylor coming one after another. In the midst of visits by American military personnel and pledges of more military assistance, military coups have taken place in some countries. The United States, through the reactionaries of some countries, is plotting military coups and strengthening fascist rule in order to further bind these countries to the US chariot of aggression in Asia, so as to realize its conspiracy of using Asians to fight Asians.

　　This new aggressive conspiracy of the United States is a struggle after a series of failures in the Middle East, especially in the Taiwan Strait area. The Chinese people and the people of all countries in the Western Pacific will never allow the US conspiracy to succeed. Recently, the Japanese people have launched a large-scale national movement against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and demanding the abolition of this treaty. The Nobusuke Kishi government, the United States' faithful pawn, is already on the verge of collapse. In the face of the powerful forces of the Eastern countries, this conspiracy of the United States is doomed to be crushed.

### 失败还要捣乱  垂死犹作挣扎  美国在西太平洋加紧部署新侵略

    失败还要捣乱  垂死犹作挣扎
    美国在西太平洋加紧部署新侵略
    积极制造两个中国
    竭力拼凑侵略锁链
    驱策日本充当走卒
    到处策划军事政变
    新华社13日讯　美国在公开推行制造“两个中国”的阴谋的同时，正在紧张地拼凑它在西太平洋的侵略锁链。
    这是美国战争挑拨者最近在台湾海峡地区遭到失败以后，正在进行着的重新部署。美国这次在强大的中国人民面前玩弄战争边缘把戏，较之它不久以前出兵侵略中东，陷入了更加众叛亲离的极端孤立境地。除岸信介和李承晚以外，其他数十个同美国结盟的国家个个都袖手旁观，美国长期以来苦心培植的一套军事集团阵势形同瘫痪，纸老虎原形毕露。因此，目前，美国竭力设法挽回这种颓势，竭力加强对它的西太平洋“盟国”的控制，以便驱策它们来为美国的侵略政策服务。
    美国这种打算首先表现在美国同日本举行的修改美日“安全条约”谈判上。美国不但要以“保卫日本”的名义，长期霸占日本，而且美国已经提出，在修改后的条约里要把美日“共同防御地区”扩大到西太平洋其他地区。岸信介也一再公开表示，要把美军占领下的冲绳和小笠原群岛包括在“共同防御地区”内。无论是包括整个西太平洋或者冲绳和小笠原群岛，都将使美国长期策划的“东北亚条约组织”事实上形成，因为冲绳和小笠原群岛本来已经属于美国同李承晚、蒋介石“双边条约”规定的“共同防御”范围。
    不仅这样，美国还在为它制造“两个中国”的阴谋争取有更多国家参加的“国际保证”。经常反映美国当权者意图的“纽约时报”，在10月16日的一篇社论里就谈到了这一点。它说，美国要“邀请澳大利亚和新西兰以及其他太平洋国家的政府同我们一起保证台湾的防务”。美国“商业周刊”11月初报道，“杜勒斯当前的目标”是要使澳大利亚、新西兰和菲律宾“同美国一起保证福摩萨（台湾）的防务”，再早晚把其他国家也包括进去。美国正是把这种“保证”作为连接它在西太平洋侵略锁链的一个手段。
    自然，美国在挑选它在远东的侵略走卒中，是特别看中了日本的。让亚洲人打亚洲人，让日本军国主义者成为美国在西太平洋侵略扩张的主要帮凶，这便是美国在修改美日“安全条约”中企图从岸信介政府手中攫取的东西。而正在这方面，日本首相岸信介也蠢蠢欲动，叫嚷要废除禁止派兵出国的日本宪法条款，“尽一切可能的办法同美国进行合作”。重作“大东亚共荣圈”旧梦的岸信介在同美国记者布朗谈话里，并且露骨地表示要向东南亚扩张，要染指朝鲜和台湾。
    岸信介政府如此来同美国“合作”，暴露了日本帝国主义者的野心。同样，美国需要日本这种识途老马，也暴露了美帝国主义者自己。美帝国主义不正是走着日本帝国主义在西太平洋侵略的老路吗？中国人民不会忘记，日本是怎样先侵占台湾而后进攻中国大陆的。东南亚国家人民不会忘记，日本是怎样“南进”来扩张它的“大东亚共荣圈”的。因此，美国利用日本在西太平洋狼狈为奸，不但是对中国人民的威胁，也是对亚洲各国人民的威胁。帝国主义总是先向他们认为是弱点的地方进攻的，美国和日本帝国主义者是会知道今天人民中国的铜墙铁壁并不好碰的，他们在“反共”的口号下，实际上将把侵略的矛头指向“南进”的道路。
    被美国当作锁链环节的盟国，将是首当其冲。最近美国已经在加紧控制它们。8月以来，美国军人访问亚洲盟国特别频繁，美国陆军部长布鲁克、国防部长麦克耳罗伊、陆军参谋长泰勒等等接踵而来。在美国军人访问和给予更多军事援助声中，一些国家发生了军事政变。美国通过一些国家反动派来策动军事政变，加强法西斯统治，是要更加把这些国家缚上美国在亚洲侵略的战车，来实现它利用亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋。
    美国这种新的侵略阴谋，是它在中东特别是在台湾海峡地区一连串失败以后的一种挣扎。中国人民和西太平洋各国人民决不会允许美国的阴谋得逞。最近，日本人民已经展开了一个声势浩大的反对修改美日“安全条约”、要求废除这个条约的国民运动。美国的忠实走卒岸信介政府已经摇摇欲倒。在强大的东方各国人民力量的面前，美国这种阴谋是注定要被粉碎的。
