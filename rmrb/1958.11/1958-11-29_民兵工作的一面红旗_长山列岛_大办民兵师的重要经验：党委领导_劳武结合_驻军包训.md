Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th. Reporter Jiang Wenpin reports: In achieving universal military service, the Changshan Islands have gained experience in aspects such as Party committee leadership, the combination of labor and military affairs, and garrison troops providing training. Recently, Shandong Province held a provincial on-site meeting on militia work on the Changshan Islands. Representatives unanimously agreed that the island's militia work is a red flag.

After the Changshan Islands achieved universal military service, while promoting industrial and agricultural production, the county's militia used labor breaks for military training and achieved excellent results. Militiamen participating in the first and second rifle practice live ammunition shooting achieved excellent overall evaluations for the entire county. Light and heavy machine guns, anti-aircraft machine guns, mortars, and anti-tank gun shooting results were also excellent. Militiamen learning communications achieved excellent indicators in sending and receiving telegrams. Many female militia members participated in battlefield first aid training. During the meeting, representatives saw many of their outstanding shooting performances. One established squad of ten female militia members, with an average age of seventeen, achieved a perfect score in the second rifle practice. Another militia squad, shooting at maritime targets at a distance of 210 meters, achieved excellent scores for eleven people and good scores for one person. Six militiamen learning anti-tank guns became all-around gunners in eleven hours. Their on-site shooting performance was excellent for the entire squad, with three people hitting the target five out of five times.

The militia training work on the Changshan Islands not only did not hinder production but also promoted production. Of the island's 8,518 laborers, who in previous years were all engaged in fishery and agricultural production, over 1,000 full-time laborers were extracted this autumn to participate in steel production. In this situation, all commune members and militiamen still completed the sowing of 8,400 mu of wheat on time and completed the autumn harvest five to seven days ahead of schedule. Fishery production on the island accounts for 80% of total income. By the end of October, 36 million jin of fish had been produced, approaching the total annual output of last year. The people on the island have generally reached or exceeded the living standards of prosperous middle peasants. The island's militia eradicated illiteracy by the end of September. The relationship between the army and the people on the island has also developed to a new stage. The troops regard the people's commune as their own commune, and the militia regard the company as their second "home."

Representatives attending the on-site meeting on militia work believe that the Changshan Islands have three important experiences in achieving universal military service and vigorously developing militia divisions.

Party committee leadership, putting politics in command, and the active initiative of business departments are the main experiences in doing a good job in universal military service. After the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the call for universal military service, the Changdao County Party Committee personally grasped the militia organization, and the first secretary of the county Party committee presided over on-site meetings to promote the militia work experience of advanced townships, and constantly conducted national defense education for the people. The county party secretary and the county head both study military affairs. The county people's armed forces department, in accordance with the instructions of the higher authorities, actively formulated plans for organizing and training the militia, and promptly obtained the support of the Party committee and the garrison troops. In its regular work, the Party committee also took grasping the militia organization as the main body everywhere, and promptly carried out comparisons to exercise and consolidate the militia organization's shock role in various productions.

Secondly, the army's vigorous assistance is an important condition for doing a good job in militia training. The garrison troops on the island take the island as their home, rely on the masses, do a good job in universal training, and the concept of the military and the people jointly defending the coast is very clear. Their slogan is: "We must work with the people of Changshan Island to build it into a fortress for resisting the enemy and a paradise for living." Therefore, they regard training the militia as their important task, achieving "three packages" (package training, package equipment, package production), "four samenesses" (instructors eat, live, labor, and study with the militia in the fields), "two teachings" (teach technology, teach ideology), and "one learning" (learn the militiamen's drive). The various troops dispatched a large number of outstanding officers and soldiers to serve as instructors, scattered in the fields to work alongside them, taking time out to train them, and equipping the local militia with surplus weapons and equipment.

The experience of the Changshan Islands also proves that to achieve universal military service and vigorously develop militia divisions, we must resolutely implement the principle of combining labor and military affairs. Only by combining labor and military affairs can we promote a double leap forward in production and training.

    民兵工作的一面红旗——长山列岛
    大办民兵师的重要经验：党委领导　劳武结合　驻军包训
    新华社济南28日电　记者姜文品报道：在实现全民皆兵中，长山列岛取得了党委领导、劳武结合、驻军包训等方面的经验。最近，山东全省民兵工作现场会议在长山列岛召开，代表们一致认为这个岛的民兵工作是一面红旗。
    长山列岛实现全民皆兵以后，在促进工农业生产的同时，全县民兵利用劳动空隙进行了军事训练，取得优秀成绩。参加步枪第一、第二练习实弹射击的民兵，全县总评优秀；轻重机枪、高射机枪、迫击炮和战防炮的射击成绩也是优秀。学习通信兵的民兵，收发电报技术达到优秀指标。许多女民兵参加了战地救护训练。在会议期间，代表们看到了他们许多优异的射击表演。有一个建制班十个女民兵平均年龄十七岁，打步枪第二练习，全班满堂红。另一个民兵班，对海上目标射击，在二百一十公尺的距离内，十一人成绩优秀，一人良好。有六个民兵学习战防炮，在十一个小时就达到了全能炮手。他们现场射击表演，全班优秀，有三人五发五中。
    长山列岛的民兵训练工作，不仅没有妨碍生产，而且促进了生产。全岛八千五百一十八个劳动力，往年全是从事渔业农业生产，今秋抽出一千多个整劳动力参加钢铁生产。在这种情况下，全体社员、民兵仍是按时完成了八千四百亩小麦的播种任务，提前五天到七天完成了秋收任务。岛上的渔业生产，占全部收入的80％。到10月底止，已产鱼三千六百万斤，接近去年全年的产量。全岛人民普遍达到或超过了富裕中农的生活水平。全岛民兵已在9月底扫除了文盲。岛上的军民关系也发展到一个新的阶段。部队把人民公社看成是自己的公社，民兵把连队看成是自己的第二个“家”。
    参加民兵工作现场会议的代表们认为，长山列岛在全民皆兵、大办民兵师中有三条重要经验。
    党委领导，政治挂帅，业务部门积极主动，是搞好全民皆兵工作的主要经验。在党中央和毛主席提出全民皆兵的号召以后，中共长岛县委亲自抓民兵组织，县委第一书记主持现场会议，推广先进乡的民兵工作经验，并不断对人民群众进行国防教育。县委书记和县长都学军事。县人民武装部根据上级指示，积极作出组织和训练民兵的方案，及时取得党委领导和驻军的支持。党委在经常工作中，也处处以抓民兵组织为主体，及时进行评比，来锻炼和巩固民兵组织在各种生产中的突击作用。
    其次，军队的大力帮助，是搞好民兵训练的重要条件。岛上驻军，以岛为家，依靠群众，搞好全民训练，军民共同保卫海防的观念非常明确，他们的口号是：“要与长山岛人民一起，建设成为御敌的堡垒，生活的乐园”。因此，他们把训练民兵看成是自己的重要任务，做到“三包”（包训练、包器材、包生产）“四同”（教练员在田间与民兵同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习）“两教”（教技术、教思想）“一学”（学习民兵的干劲）。各部队抽出了大批优秀官兵充任教练员，分散在田间跟班劳动，抽空训练，并以多余的武器装备当地民兵。
    长山列岛的经验还证明，实现全民皆兵和大办民兵师，必须坚决贯彻劳武结合的原则。只有劳武结合，才能促进生产和训练双跃进。
