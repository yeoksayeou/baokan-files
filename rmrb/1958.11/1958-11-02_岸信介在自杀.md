Kishi Nobusuke is Committing Suicide
Jiang Zhi Shui

The Kishi Nobusuke government, in order to prepare public opinion for its overall plan to revive Japanese militarism, is doing its utmost to rehabilitate Japanese militarists, and has recently resorted to using films to cover up their crimes. According to reports, the Japan Shintoho Film Company has recently produced several films promoting the Kishi Nobusuke government's propositions. Some of these films glorify Japan's war of aggression against China, others distort the Russo-Japanese War, and yet another color film, tentatively titled "Greater East Asia War," "shamelessly boasts that the 'ideal' of the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' is being realized, portraying Japan's aggression during World War II as 'self-defense'," and "openly depicts Hideki Tojo, the main culprit of the war of aggression against China and the initiator of the Pacific War, as a 'hero.'" This is truly an open deception and contempt for the Japanese people, and an open challenge to the people of the world!

In fact, this method is not unique to Kishi Nobusuke. Decades ago, Goebbels, the propaganda minister of Nazi Germany, was already a pioneer in this. Goebbels took charge of German film production to promote fascism. Anyone who has read Georges Sadoul's "History of World Cinema" will not forget a cruel fact he wrote: "When Germany ravaged Poland, Himmler and his cameramen filmed the terrible bombing of Warsaw, the destruction of the afflicted city, and the scenes of Goering's planes dropping bombs. On an evening in March 1940, the German embassies in Oslo and Copenhagen simultaneously invited dignitaries from Norway and Denmark to attend a film reception, where a film specifically depicting the terrible situation of the Polish war was screened. The next morning, Hitler's troops invaded Norway and Denmark."

Kishi Nobusuke is now following the old path of his mentors and friends. Although the plots of these Shintoho films and Kishi Nobusuke's steps in using these propaganda tools are not entirely the same, they are equally full of threats, intimidation, and hooliganism. The crime has already begun. The Japanese people should be the first to recognize how the Kishi Nobusuke government is pushing the Japanese people into a historical disaster behind these films that rehabilitate war criminals. For us, it will become increasingly clear through these films to recognize the face of Kishi Nobusuke, this militarist ringleader.

Despite how Kishi Nobusuke and his ilk want to beautify the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" in films, the Chinese people are well aware of the unforgettable experiences that this "Co-Prosperity Sphere" brought us; and it will not be easy to forget Hideki Tojo, the war criminal stained with the blood of the Chinese people, in the minds of our generation. As for the Japanese people, they certainly will not forget Tojo Hideki's evil deeds! Kishi Nobusuke put him on the screen and pushed him in front of the Japanese people, which cannot but make them once again recall the suffering that the war of aggression brought to the Japanese people, from which the scars have not yet healed. The Japanese people certainly know better than us how to deal with the group of criminals who want to push them into the sea of suffering.

On May 3, 1945, Goebbels, the master of Hitler's films, used the "painless death" method he advocated during his lifetime, imitating the technique in the film "Am I a Murderer?", forcing his wife and six children to commit suicide with poison. History is merciless. These films that the Kishi Nobusuke government is mass-producing to preach Japanese militarism are also taking a suicidal path. We believe that the Japanese people who persist in their struggle will further promote his demise.

    岸信介在自杀
    江之水
    岸信介政府为了给自己复活日本军国主义的总计划做好舆论的准备，正极力为日本军国主义者做翻案文章，最近又利用起电影来为他们的罪恶掩饰了。据报载，日本新东宝影片公司最近拍了好几部宣传岸信介政府主张的影片，有的是为日本发动的侵华战争而吹嘘的，有的则歪曲了日俄战争，还有一部暂定名为“大东亚战争”的五彩影片，“公然吹嘘‘大东亚共荣圈’的‘理想’正在实现，把日本在第二次世界大战中的侵略罪行说成是‘自卫’”，“公然把侵华战争的元凶和发动太平洋战争的祸首东条英机描绘成‘英雄’。”这真是对日本人民公开的欺骗和轻蔑，也是对世界人民公然挑战！
    其实，这种手段也非岸信介独创，十几年前纳粹德国的宣传部长戈培尔已是一名先行者了。戈培尔总揽了德国电影生产，用来宣传法西斯主义，读过乔治·萨杜尔的“电影通史”的人，都不会忘记他写过的一个残酷的事实：“当德国蹂躏波兰的时候，希普勒和他的摄影人员便把华沙的可怕轰炸，这个罹难城市的毁坏，以及戈林飞机投掷炸弹的情景都一一拍摄下来。1940年3月间的一个晚上，驻奥斯陆和哥本哈根的德国大使馆同时邀请挪威和丹麦两国的要人们出席了一个电影招待会，会上放映了一部专门描写波兰战争可怕情况的影片。第二天早晨，希特勒的军队就侵入了挪威和丹麦。”
    岸信介如今正在走着他的师傅和朋友的老路。虽然新东宝的这些影片的情节以及岸信介在运用这些宣传工具的步骤上不尽相同，但是同样的充满了威胁、恐吓和流氓手段。罪恶已经开始了，日本人民应该第一个认清在这些为战犯们翻案的影片的背后，岸信介政府正怎样把日本人民推向一个历史的灾难中；对于我们来说，通过这些影片来认识岸信介这个军国主义首脑分子的面目是会愈加清楚了。
    尽管岸信介们想在影片里怎样美化“大东亚共荣圈”，可是中国人民是深知这个“共荣圈”曾经带给我们一些什么样的难忘的经历；而东条英机，那个沾满了中国人民鲜血的战犯，要想在我们这一代人心中遗忘他也是不大容易的事。至于日本人民，当然更不会忘记东条英机的恶迹！岸信介把他搬上银幕，推到日本人民面前，不能不让他们再一次回忆起侵略战争给日本人民带来的苦难，至今疮痍未复。日本人民当然也更比我们清楚怎样对待那群要想把他们推下苦海的罪犯们。
    1945年5月3日，那位希特勒电影的主人戈培尔，用他生前提倡过的“无痛苦的死亡”的办法，学了宣传这种残忍思想的影片“我是凶手吗”中的手法，强迫他妻子和六个孩子跟他一块服毒自杀了。历史是无情的，岸信介政府正大量拍制的这些为日本军国主义说教的影片，也正是走的一条自杀的路，我们相信，坚持斗争的日本人民更会促进他的死亡。
