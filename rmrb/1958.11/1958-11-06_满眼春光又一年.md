    Another Year of Spring Scenery
    Ge De
    We are approaching the eve of the great festival of the working people of the world once again.

    Our newspaper praises the scene of the working people of the socialist camp countries welcoming the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution as "The socialist family is full of spring." This not only depicts the thriving scene in the socialist family, but also expresses the joy of the people living in the socialist family. When nature pushes winter in front of us, we, the people living in the socialist family, feel that spring is pleasant everywhere, a hundred flowers are blooming, the east wind is blowing, and our spirits are refreshed.

    Who has completely transformed the climate of the earth? It is the communists! It is the working people of our entire socialist camp, as well as the working people of the world, who have jointly set off the east wind that sweeps the world and created this beautiful and pleasant spring! But when we trace the origin of this beautiful spring, we cannot help but look back to forty-one years ago, when Lenin and his party led the Russian people, on this day forty-one years ago, to raise the first sun of mankind on the earth. This was the first ray of light that broke through the dark clouds. Since then, the light of the October Socialist Revolution has shone for a full forty-one years. People living in the dark mist opened their eyes, rushed to the light, and engaged in a victorious struggle with the darkness. As a result, the east wind grew stronger, and spring arrived. Today, except for some dark corners, the world is full of spring. This is why every time the October Revolution Day arrives, people all over the world cannot help but offer the highest praise to it.

    However, we do not only know how to praise our glorious past and present, but are more committed to the glorious future. We clearly understand that what lies before the people of our socialist camp is: the darkness in the world has not yet been completely dispelled; the ideal communist world has not yet been built. These dual glorious tasks especially require revolutionaries all over the world, especially the people of the socialist camp countries, to carry out comprehensive communist cooperation and jointly leap forward again and again.

    Our camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is engaged in a peaceful but fierce competition with the reactionary camp headed by American imperialism. We must settle accounts from time to time, review our strength, and promote greater leaps forward in the future. Increase our ambition and deflate the enemy's arrogance. The October Revolution Day is a day for us to jointly review our strength. We say that the October Revolution Day is our common festival, which also contains such a meaning.

    This year's accounts are settled very well, and the conclusion is: "We are about to move to the forefront!" This voice is enough to shatter the hearts of some other people. The next goal has been planned: to stand at the forefront.

    Standing at the forefront is certain. This is not only evidenced by the facts of the "full garden of spring" published in the newspapers, nor is it only evidenced by the very accurate figures announced by Comrade Khrushchev, but also by the entire people of our socialist camp. We deeply understand what a leap forward is, and what a terrible force a common leap forward in the socialist camp will be for the enemy! The great leap forward is precisely the biggest feature of our socialist camp today. The great Soviet people use the spring of internationalism to irrigate the garden of the entire socialist camp. In our common cultivation, they make the flowers bloom more brightly and the fruits bear more abundantly. And the United States, like a big stink bug with many suction tubes, crawls on top of the entire capitalist world, and can only swell its belly by sucking the blood of the people there. Can these days last long?

    The accounts have been settled, and an even greater leap forward is about to begin. Such accounts must be settled every year, and every time we settle an account, we will go to a higher level and make a newer leap. This is precisely the active character of Marxism-Leninism, and this is the true color of the liberated working people!

    满眼春光又一年
    葛德
    又来到全世界劳动人民伟大节日的前夕了。
    我们报纸称颂社会主义阵营各国劳动人民迎接十月革命四十一周年的景象是：“社会主义大家庭春色满园”。这不只是描绘了社会主义大家庭里欣欣向荣的景象，而且表达了生活在社会主义大家庭中的人们的欢愉心情。当大自然把冬季推到我们面前的时候，我们，生活在社会主义大家庭里的人们，却觉得到处都春色宜人，百花争艳，东风扑面，精神健爽。
    是谁整个地改造了大地的气候？是共产主义者！是我们整个社会主义阵营的劳动人民，还有全世界上的劳动人民，共同掀起了吹遍世界的东风，缔造了这个美丽宜人的春天！但是当我们追寻这个美好的春天的起源的时候，便不能不回顾到四十一年前，正是列宁和他的党领导的俄国人民，在四十一年前的今天，使地球上升起了第一颗人类的太阳，这是冲破黑暗云层的第一道亮光。从那以后，十月社会主义革命的光芒，已经照耀了整整四十一年。生活在暗雾中的人们，睁开了眼睛，奔向光明，同黑暗展开了胜利地搏斗，于是，东风大长了，春天到来了。今天，除过一些黑暗的角落以外，世界上已是大地皆春了。这就是为什么每逢到十月革命节，全世界人民便情不自禁地要对它作最高的歌颂的原因。
    然而，我们并不是只知讴歌自己光辉的过去和现在，而是更加致力于光辉的未来。我们清楚地了解，摆在我们社会主义阵营人民面前的是：世界上的黑暗尚未驱尽；理想的共产主义人间尚未建成。这双重的光荣任务，都特别需要全世界的革命者、首先是社会主义阵营各国人民进行全面的共产主义大协作，共同地跃进再跃进。
    以苏联为首的我们的阵营，正同以美帝国主义为首的反动阵营进行着和平的但是剧烈的竞赛。我们要时时地结算账目，检阅力量，促进今后更大的跃进。长自己志气，灭敌人威风。十月革命节，正是我们共同检阅自己力量的一个日子。我们说十月革命节是我们共同的节日，也是包含着这样一层意思的。
    今年的账目结算得很好，结论是：“我们就要走到最前头”！这个声音，足以震碎另外一些人的心脏。下一个目标已经规划好了：站到前头去。
    站到前头去，这是肯定的。这不仅有报纸上刊载过的那些“满园春色”的事实作证，也不仅有赫鲁晓夫同志宣布过的计算得很准确的数字作证，而且有我们社会主义阵营中的全体人民作证。我们深深懂得，跃进是怎样一回事，而社会主义阵营里共同大跃进，对于敌人来说，将是怎样一种可怕的力量！大跃进，恰好就是我们社会主义阵营中当前最大的特色。伟大的苏联人民，他们用国际主义的泉水，灌溉整个社会主义阵营的园地，在我们共同的耕耘中，使鲜花开得更鲜艳，使果实结得更丰硕。而美国，却像一只生着许多吸血管的大臭虫，它爬在整个资本主义世界上面，只能靠了吸食那里人民的鲜血使自己肚皮膨胀起来，这种日子还能过得长吗？
    账目结过了，更大的跃进又要开始了。这样的账年年要结，而每结过一次账，我们便更上一层楼，来一个更新的飞跃。这正是马克思列宁主义思想的活跃性格，这才是解放了的劳动人民的本色！
