Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, Paris dispatch: According to TASS, Paris: The Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, Duclos, delivered a television speech on the evening of the 15th, explaining the French Communist Party's election platform, and called on French voters to vote for French Communist Party candidates in the National Assembly election.
    Duclos pointed out that the French Communist Party has consistently strived to resolve the Algerian issue through negotiations for the past four years. Only through negotiations can peace be achieved, and decisions that conform to the rights and interests of the French and Algerian people can be made. The French Communist Party is concerned with ensuring France's independence and maintaining peace. France should actively advocate for peaceful cooperation among all nations, stop the arms race, stop testing atomic weapons, and abandon policies that encourage the revival of West German militarism.
    Duclos also talked about the domestic situation in France. He pointed out that in order to finally end the poverty, colonialism, and war bred by the capitalist mode of production, it must be replaced by the socialist mode of production. The French Communist Party is not satisfied with talking, but wants to use actual struggle to strive for concrete solutions to the urgent problems facing the country.
    Duclos pointed out that due to the passage of the new constitution, parliamentary activities will become more difficult in the future. Only with a strong Communist opposition in the parliament can effective struggles be waged for measures to improve the people's living standards.
    Considering that the total amount of wages for working people has decreased by 10 billion in the past month, the French Communist Party advocates increasing wages, pensions, and family allowances. The French Communist Party also advocates restoring the 40-hour work week without reducing wages, and advocates that employers allocate funds to establish unemployment relief funds. The French Communist Party also advocates using the funds from the Algerian war to build residential housing and schools, and advocates adopting effective policies to assist small and medium-sized farmers, and believes that it is necessary to support handicraftsmen and defend small businesses.
    Duclos emphasized that the French Communist Party vigilantly defends democratic freedoms and bears no responsibility for the current situation in France. The candidates nominated by the French Communist Party primarily consider defending the interests of the people, which are inseparable from the interests of France.
    Duclos called on French voters to once again express their firm determination, to vote for those who advocate changing the status quo, and to vote for Communist candidates.
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 15th: The General Secretary of the French Communist Party, Thorez, published a statement to the "Humanity Weekly" on the eve of the election, calling on the people to vote for the Communist Party. He recalled: The current government, which possesses all the power, has not solved any major problems in nearly six months.
    Thorez talked about the Algerian war and emphasized the deceptive nature of holding French National Assembly elections in Algeria. He said: While people lack housing, schools, and laboratories, the authorities have invested a huge sum of 1,555 billion francs into the bottomless pit of military expenditure.
    He also said: The economic crisis has already begun in France, and unemployment is emerging. The purchasing power of the working masses is constantly declining. In politics, the new "constitution" has reduced the power of the parliament. The purpose of the regressive electoral system is to deprive the working class of its representation in the National Assembly.
    When talking about foreign policy, Thorez pointed out: France has consistently been subordinate to the aggressive North Atlantic bloc and will invest itself into the so-called "Common Market" of the six Western European countries on January 1st next year. This "Common Market" will confirm the dominant position of revanchist West Germany in Western Europe.
    In order to oppose the aforementioned reactionary policies that lead to poverty and war, Thorez asked everyone to vote for the Communist Party in order to strive for peace in Algeria, strive for respect for democratic freedoms, strive for increased wages and the establishment of unemployment insurance funds funded by capitalists, strive to pursue a foreign policy that defends peace and maintains national independence, and strive to ensure the future of the Republic.

    多列士和杜克洛向法国选民指出
    法共是人民利益的保卫者
    要求选民表示坚定决心把票投给共产党候选人
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛15日晚上发表电视演说，说明法国共产党的竞选纲领，并且号召法国选民在国民议会选举中投法国共产党候选人的票。
    杜克洛指出，法国共产党四年以来一贯争取通过谈判解决阿尔及利亚问题。只有通过谈判，才能走向和平，才能够作出符合法国和阿尔及利亚人民权利和利益的决定。法国共产党关心保证法国独立和维护和平，法国应当积极主张实现各国人民的和平合作，停止军备竞赛，停止试验原子武器，放弃助长西德军国主义复活的政策。
    杜克洛还谈到法国国内的局势。他指出，为了最后终止资本主义生产方式所孕育的贫困、殖民主义和战争，必须代之以社会主义生产方式。法国共产党不满足于谈论，而是要用实际斗争来争取具体解决国家所面临的迫切问题。
    杜克洛指出，由于通过新宪法，议会活动今后将趋于困难。只有在议会中存在强大的共产党反对派，才能为通过提高人民群众生活水平的措施而进行有效的斗争。
    由于考虑到上个月劳动人民的工资总额减少了一百亿，法国共产党主张提高工资、年金和家庭补助金。法国共产党还主张恢复每周四十小时工作制而不降低工资，主张由企业主拨款建立失业救济基金。法国共产党还主张把阿尔及利亚战争的费用用来建设居民住宅和学校，主张采取有效地援助中小农户的政策，还认为必须支持手工业者和保卫小商。
    杜克洛强调说，法国共产党警惕地保卫着民主自由，对法国目前的局势没有任何责任。法国共产党提出的候选人，他们首先考虑的是保卫与法国利益不可分割的人民利益。
    杜克洛号召法国选民再一次表示坚定的决心，投主张改变现状的人的票，投共产党候选人的票。
    新华社巴黎15日电　法国共产党总书记多列士在选举前夕向“人道报星期刊”发表谈话，号召人民投共产党的票。他追述说：拥有一切权力的现政府在将近六个月的时间里不曾解决任何重大问题。
    多列士谈到阿尔及利亚战争，并且强调指出了在阿尔及利亚举行法国国民议会选举的欺骗性质。他说：正当人们缺乏住房、学校和试验室的时候，当局却把一万五千五百五十亿法郎的巨款投入了军事开支的无底洞。
    他又说：经济危机在法国已经开始，失业情况正在纷纷出现。劳动群众的购买力正不断下降。在政治方面，新“宪法”削减了议会的权力。倒退的选举制的目的是在于剥夺工人阶级在国民议会中的代表权。
    多列士谈到外交政策时指出：法国始终从属于北大西洋侵略集团并将在明年1月1日投入所谓西欧六国“共同市场”，这个“共同市场”将确认复仇主义的西德在西欧的优势地位。
    为了反对上述招致贫困和战争的反动政策，多列士要求大家投共产党的票，以争取在阿尔及利亚实现和平，争取尊重民主自由，争取增加工资并由资方出资建立失业保险金，争取奉行保卫和平和维护民族独立的外交政策，争取确保共和国的前途。
