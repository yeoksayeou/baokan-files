    Miners Are Motivated, Technology Has Improved
    Romanian Coal Industry Exceeds Production Plan

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Romanian coal mining industry has exceeded its plan for the first nine months of the year, producing a total of 80,000 tons of coal, and saving 11 million lei due to cost reductions. Thus, Romanian miners have changed the past situation where they often failed to meet production plans.

    Compared with the same period last year, coal production in the first nine months of this year increased by 5.5%, and labor productivity increased by 10%.

    According to the Secretary-General of the Romanian Ministry of Mines, D. Bogdan, the reason for this achievement this year is that the government has increased investment in the coal industry, the level of mechanization of coal mining has been improved, and production technology has been improved. But more importantly, the miners are more motivated than in the past. About 1,000 mining production teams across the country enthusiastically launched a labor competition to "produce one more ton of coal per person per shift." Based on the current enthusiasm of the masses, it will be possible to overproduce another 40,000 tons of coal by the end of this year.

    Romania's coal industry has developed significantly since liberation. Total coal production this year will increase to 2.5 times the highest production in 1938 before liberation, of which lignite production will increase to five times.

### 矿工干劲大　技术有改进  罗采煤工业超额完成生产计划

    矿工干劲大　技术有改进
    罗采煤工业超额完成生产计划
    据新华社讯　罗马尼亚采煤工业超额完成了头九个月计划，共生产了八万吨煤，由于降低成本而节约了一千一百万列伊。这样，罗马尼亚矿工们就改变了过去常常不能完成生产计划的局面。
    同去年同期比较，今年头九个月的产煤量增加了5.5％，劳动生产率提高了10％。
    据罗马尼亚矿业部秘书长德·包格丹对记者说，今年所以有这样的成就，是因为政府增加了对煤炭工业的投资，采煤的机械化水平有了提高，生产技术有了改进。但更重要的是，矿工的干劲比过去大了。全国约一千个矿工生产队热烈地展开了“每一工作班每人多生产一吨煤”的劳动竞赛。根据群众目前的干劲，到今年年底将可能再超计划生产四万吨煤。
    罗马尼亚的煤炭工业在解放后有了显著的发展。煤的总产量今年将增加到解放前产量最高的1938年的二点五倍，其中褐煤的产量将增加到五倍。
