Vital Transportation Artery Tightly Strained; Homemade Machinery Displays its Power

    (Report from this newspaper) The use of homemade machinery for loading and unloading at the Mao'erkou Wharf in Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, has eliminated the congestion at the wharf.
    The Jiangkou Mao'ertuo Wharf in Jiangjin County is the terminus of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway and the intersection point with the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. It is also a vital artery for the entry and exit of materials from Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan. Coal and coke from the Nantong Mining Bureau, and raw steel materials from Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, all pass through here. In the fourth quarter of this year, due to the surge in raw steel materials, the daily throughput has increased to over 10,000 tons, a fourfold increase compared to last year. However, the Mao'ertuo Wharf is small, with a short distance, narrow space, steep slopes, and high labor intensity, relying entirely on manual handling. It was clearly difficult to handle such a heavy transportation task. Chongqing put forward the slogan: "Fight hard for a month to achieve uphill riding, overhead cable transport, downhill chute transport, and flat road wheeled transport; use low-cost, high-efficiency, local methods to replace the heavy physical labor of porters." This slogan immediately received enthusiastic support from the workers. Over 1,000 employees at the entire station immediately contributed over 5,000 brilliant ideas. The company's Party general branch and the Mao'ertuo branch immediately called on everyone: "Those who can do carpentry should do carpentry, those who can do blacksmithing should do blacksmithing, and those who can't do anything else should be ordinary laborers." A carpentry workshop, a blacksmith workshop, and a binding team were quickly established, and technical innovation was carried out on a large scale. Six wooden chutes, each 40 meters long, and a 60-meter-long gravity car track were installed. At the same time, automatic unloading gravity cars were installed, and ninety automatic coal unloading cars were made. Grain and coal were transported using chutes, coke and sundry goods were transported using gravity cars, using the weight to carry the light. This increased work efficiency threefold, reduced the heavy physical labor of workers, and eliminated the difficulty of carrying loads up and down slopes. The construction of a wooden chute frame cost only over 2,000 yuan, and based on the volume of transport, it can save the country more than 50,000 yuan a year. At the same time, it ensures the normal transportation of trains, ships, and wooden boats.

    咽喉要道运输紧　土制机械显威风
    本报讯　四川江津县猫儿口码头用土机械装卸，消除了码头繁忙的现象。
    江津县江口猫儿沱码头，是川黔铁路的终点，又是和成渝铁路的交接点。也是贵州、云南、四川物资进出的咽喉。南桐矿务局的煤焦，重庆钢铁公司的钢铁原材料等，都要从这里进出口。今年第四季度，由于钢铁原料的激增，每天运量更增加到一万吨以上，比去年增加四倍。而猫儿沱码头小，距离短，地方狭窄，坡度大，劳动强度高，完全靠人力搬运，要担任这样繁重的运输任务显然是有困难的。重庆提出了“苦战一月，实现上坡坐车，天线运输化，下坡梭槽化，平路车子化；以花钱少、效率高、土办法来代替搬运工人的笨重体力劳动。”这个口号立即获得了工人同志们的热烈拥护。全站一千多职工当即献妙计五千多件。公司党总支及猫儿沱支部立即又号召大家：“能作木工的当木工，会打铁的就打铁，什么都不会的就做普通工。”很快就建立起一个木工厂，一个铁工厂和捆绑组，大搞起技术革新。先后安设了四十公尺长的木梭槽六个，六十公尺长的坠车道，同时还安上自动卸土坠车，又做好九十部自动卸煤车。粮、煤用梭槽，焦炭和杂货用坠车，以重带轻的办法来运输。这样提高了工效三倍，减轻了工人的繁重体力劳动，消灭了上下坡挑抬的困难。安一个木梭槽架子，才花两千多元的造价，以运输量计算，一年可为国家节约五万多元的资金，同时又保证了火车、轮船、木船的正常运输。
