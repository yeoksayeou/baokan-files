"Little Eighth Route Army's" Poems

    Building a Highway
    Huang Shui fa
    Come on, classmates, let's carry soil,
    Preparing to build a highway,
    To make it even stronger,
    Guaranteeing fast transport of materials.
    No need for the teacher to call,
    Classmates work actively,
    Singing and working,
    Everyone dividing labor and cooperating.
    Big classmates, carrying stones,
    Little classmates loading baskets,
    Preparing to fight the enemy,
    Beating them until they can't raise their heads.

    Artillery Uncles Fire Well
    He Jia Ru
    Artillery uncles fire well,
    Millions of shells fly towards Jinmen Island.
    Hitting the Chiang troops into a chaotic retreat,
    Hitting the military camps until they disappear,
    Hitting the enemy ships to the bottom of the sea,
    Hitting the enemy planes down.
    Everyone listens and laughs heartily,
    Everyone praises how well they fire.

    “小八路”的诗
    修公路
    黄水发
    同学们，来挑土，
    准备修公路，
    把它修得更牢固，
    保证物资快运输。
    不用老师喊，
    同学积极干，
    又唱歌又工作，
    大家分工又合作。
    大同学，扛石头，
    小同学来装篓，
    准备打敌人，
    打得它抬不起头。
    炮兵叔叔打得好
    何佳汝
    炮兵叔叔打得好，
    千万颗炮弹飞向金门岛。
    打得蒋军乱逃跑，
    打得军营不见了，
    打得敌舰沉海底，
    打得敌机往下掉。
    人人听了哈哈笑，
    个个称赞打得好。
