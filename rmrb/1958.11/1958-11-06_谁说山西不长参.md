Ginseng and deer antlers are both precious medicinal materials. Traditionally, people have regarded ginseng cultivation and deer breeding as very mysterious, saying, "Ginseng is a treasure of Northeast China, unable to survive outside the deep mountains." It was also said, "Sika deer need to eat Ganoderma lucidum, but the soil in southern Shanxi is hard and the mountains are small, so the deer won't adapt to the environment, and there's no grass." During the Great Leap Forward, the Jiang County Pharmaceutical Company in Shanxi Province boldly tried to grow ginseng and raise deer, and has already achieved success.

After a year of trial cultivation and breeding, there are currently 50,130 ginseng plants planted in places like Dajin Mountain, and basically all of them have sprouted. The ginseng bodies are four to five inches long, and their growth is no worse than that in the Northeast. Twenty purebred sika deer purchased from Shuangyang County, Jilin Province, have produced three new fawns this year. Due to sufficient water, grass, and feed, and good breeding management, four pairs of antlers were harvested in the third quarter. Judging from the color and quality, they have reached and even exceeded the level of those from outside the pass (Northeast China).

The success of the trial cultivation of ginseng and deer breeding has given them great encouragement. Now they are striving towards higher goals, and their slogan is:

	Ginseng, antlers, Sichuan, Guangdong, and the Zhongtiao Mountains,
	The four major Huai medicines are brought home;
	This year, we will not purchase outside the county,
	Next year, we will strive to supply southern Shanxi.
	A major campaign to collect and process medicinal materials,
	Turning barren mountains into medicinal material mountains;
	Large-scale cooperation in planting medicine and cultivating forests,
	Bringing hundreds of wild medicines into the fields.
	Increase the purchase of medicinal materials fourfold,
	The masses' income will be one million yuan;
	Integration of medicine and health exceeds Dengfeng,
	Strong people and horses vigorously engage in production.

### 谁说山西不长参

    谁说山西不长参
    人参和鹿茸都是名贵药材。人们在传统上却把人参的种植和鹿的饲养看得很神秘，说：“人参是关东宝，长在深山活不了”。又说：“梅花鹿要吃灵芝草，晋南土硬山小，鹿不服水土，也没草料”。在大跃进中，山西省绛县药材公司大胆地试种人参、试养鹿，并已获得成功。
    经过一年试种、试养，目前在大金山等地已植参五万零一百三十株，基本上全苗，参体长四至五寸，生长情况比东北也不差。由吉林省双阳县购买的二十只纯种梅花鹿，今年已新育三只小鹿，由于水草饲料足，饲养管理得好，三季度锯茸四副，从颜色质量来看，都达到和超过关外水平。
    试种参、试养鹿的成功，给他们极大的鼓励。现在他们正朝着更高的目标努力，他们的行动口号是：
    参茸川广上中条，
    四大怀货把家搬；
    今年采购不出县，
    明年争取供晋南。
    采刨药材大进军，
    荒山变成药材山；
    种药育林大协作，
    百味野药入田园。
    收购药材增四倍，
    群众收入百万元；
    医药结合超登封，
    人强马壮闹生产。（附图片）
