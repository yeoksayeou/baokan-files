How We Consolidate and Improve Mass Philosophy Learning
    Propaganda Department of the Longxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Fujian Province

    After the mass movement to study philosophy was launched, Party organizations should strengthen their leadership over the movement. Only in this way can we consolidate the achievements and improve the quality. Therefore, some time ago, our district organized the consolidation and improvement work centered on grasping the improvement of commune Party schools, training lecturers, and establishing and improving systems. After half a month of effort, the movement has begun to normalize. In 25 of the 44 old townships in Pinghe County, the leaders attached importance to it, closely integrated with the central tasks, and philosophy went wherever production went, forming an atmosphere where everyone studies philosophy, everyone promotes philosophy, and everyone applies philosophy. In Nan'jing County, 60% of the communes have also seen this new situation.

    At present, the mass movement to study philosophy is expanding further, and the quality of lecturers has also been further improved. Pinghe County has adopted small and medium-sized centralized training at the county, commune, production team, stove-side, and field-side levels, and further trained more than 7,000 lecturers. Other counties have also trained a group of lecturers. For example, all lecturers in the Yunxiao Red Flag People's Commune have undergone two trainings.

    With more teaching resources, lecturers can teach more extensively, and the masses can study more deeply. Especially on the steel front, the study movement has been carried out even better. The Haicheng Port Iron and Steel Plant combined philosophy and technology in classes through the Red and Expert School, looking for contradictions in ideology and technology, solving ideological problems, and establishing a "three-way handover" system (i.e., a system for checking iron gates, iron slag, and air pipes during handover, and handling problems together). With a responsibility system and regular inspections, the output has been increasing day by day. Two teams in the Nanjing Jinshan Commune had conflicts. One team had technology and tools, but lacked labor and forests; the other team had forests and labor, but lacked tools and technology. As a result, neither team could produce charcoal. After studying philosophy, they specifically analyzed the reasons, criticized the mistake of departmentalism, and organized three major collaborations of technology, tools, and labor, and demarcated a forest for joint logging. As a result, the past ten days to produce four tons of charcoal is now increased to five days to produce four and a half tons of charcoal.

    Some places not only conducted general education on work style and work methods, but also carried out debates on two worldviews. In Pinghe County, seven of the forty-odd charcoal kilns in Shikeng did not produce charcoal. Some elderly people sought the protection of gods and pasted a "talisman" on each kiln. They seized this example to give lectures on materialism, criticize idealism, and then conduct an in-depth inspection and found that this was because the chimneys were blocked by soil. Therefore, they broke superstition, mobilized everyone to study technology, and launched a movement to build ten-thousand-jin charcoal kilns. The Yunxiao Red Flag People's Commune studied epistemology, thereby criticizing the idea of fixed rice production and overcoming complacency. Based on the improvement of mass awareness, they organized a large-scale inspection of 5,000 people and found many new problems. For example, the Haidao Brigade discovered after inspection that more than 400 mu of fields were infested with pests, of which 60 mu had lost 20%. Therefore, some cadres said: "If we do not improve our understanding and go deep into reality, our work will not be done well, and the interests of the masses will be harmed."

    Consolidating teaching positions and improving the quality of lecturers are the keys to further launching the mass movement to study philosophy. We have gained the following main experiences in this work.

    1. Grasp the commune Party school, consolidate the teaching position, and adopt teaching forms that are more adapted to the needs of production. Our district's township Party schools were established in June. After communization, Party schools must change their original systems to meet new requirements. Some counties have already reorganized the Party school organizations. The Yunxiao Red Flag People's Commune established a commune Party school, and the brigade established a branch school. The commune Party committee appointed a deputy secretary to be responsible for leading the work of the Party school, and another cadre was designated to be stationed in the commune Party school, treating the Party school as an experimental field for political and ideological work to guide and promote overall work. In terms of teaching forms, small concentrations and short-term concentrations are adopted. Generally, the commune is the unit for centralized study for half a day, one day to one and a half days, or the brigade is the unit for centralized study in the evening or morning. The Dongshan Zhangtang Production Corps concentrated core lecturers in the camp to sleep together, studied for two hours every morning, and carried out 18 days of study, which not only did a good job in study but also did a good job in production. Haicheng County established 33 lecturer guidance and transmission stations to train lecturers in a timely manner.

    2. Train lecturers in batches and at different levels, and lecturers divide up and contract spare-time schools. The in-depth development of the mass movement to study philosophy requires continuous improvement of the level of lecturers, otherwise the movement will stagnate. Some lecturers reflected: "If we don't improve a step, the masses will not like to listen to the lectures." In order to quickly and comprehensively train lecturers, Yunxiao adopted the method of training in batches and at different levels, with mother hens hatching chicks, one giving birth to ten, and ten giving birth to a hundred. The commune Party school studies twice a month, training the top lecturers in batches and letting them return to the branch schools to be responsible for the overall training of lecturers. The Red Flag Commune Party School trained 82 lecturers, and they returned to the branch schools and trained all 1,100 lecturers. Haicheng County divided the lecturers into systems (youth, women, militia) and contracted them to spare-time schools. This ensured both popularization and the improvement of lecturers and the growth of core lecturers.

    3. Open forums, set up arenas, and lecturers compete to improve together. To improve the level of lecturers, on the one hand, they must be given more theoretical knowledge, but giving more does not mean lecturing for several hours at a time, giving a whole set, but giving a drizzle; on the other hand, they must learn to creatively teach theory and learn to explain theoretical principles based on actual conditions and using the actual experience of the masses. The level of lecturers is always inconsistent, so adopting the form of lecture competitions can not only give full play to the role of mass mutual learning and mutual education, but also stimulate the lecturers' determination to strive for progress, which is a faster, better, and more economical way to improve the quality of lecturers.

    我们怎样巩固和提高群众哲学学习
    中共福建省龙溪地委宣传部
    在全民学哲学的运动掀起以后，党的组织就要加强对运动的领导。只有这样，才能巩固成果，提高质量，因此，前些时候，我区组织了以抓提高公社党校、抓培养讲师、抓建立和健全制度为中心的巩固提高工作。经过半个月的努力，运动已开始走向正常。平和县四十四个旧乡中，有二十五个乡做到领导重视，紧密结合中心，生产到那里，哲学就到那里，形成人人学习哲学，人人宣传哲学，人人运用哲学的风气。南靖县有60％的公社也都出现了这种崭新的局面。
    目前，群众学哲学的运动更加展开了，讲师的质量也进一步提高了。平和县采用了县、公社、生产队、炉边、田头等中小型的集中训练，进一步地培养了七千多个讲师。其他各县也都训练了一批讲师，如云肖红旗人民公社全部讲师都经过了两次训练。
    讲师有了更多的教学本钱，理论就讲得更广泛了，群众学习也更深透了。特别是在钢铁战线上，学习运动开展得更好。海澄港口炼铁厂通过红专学校，把哲学、技术结合起来上课，找思想上、技术上的矛盾，解决了思想问题，并建立了“三交班”制度（即交班时检查铁门、铁渣、风管的制度，有问题要共同处理）。有了责任制，有了经常检查，就促使了产量的日益增加。南靖金山公社有两个队闹矛盾，一个队有技术，有工具，但劳力缺乏树林少；另一个队有树林，有劳力，但工具少技术差，结果两个队都烧不出木炭。经过学习哲学，他们具体分析了原因，批判了本位主义的错误，从而组织了技术、工具、劳力的三大协作，并划出一片树林共同采伐。于是，过去十天才能出木炭四吨，现在提高到五天就出木炭四吨半。
    有些地方不仅进行了一般的工作作风、工作方法的教育，还开展了两种世界观的辩论。平和县时坑四十多个木炭窑中有七个不出木炭，有的老年人为求神保庇，给每个窑贴上一张“符”。他们就抓住这个事例上唯物主义课，批判唯心主义，再深入检查，发现这是由于烟筒被土塞住。于是，破除了迷信，发动了大家钻研技术，开展了搞万斤木炭窑运动。云肖红旗人民公社学习了认识论，从而批判了水稻生产的定局论思想，克服了麻痹松懈情绪。在群众认识提高的基础上，他们组织了五千人的大检查，发现了不少新问题。如海岛大队在检查后才发现有四百多亩田有虫害，其中六十亩已损失二成。因此，有的干部说：“不提高认识，不深入实际，工作搞不好，群众利益要受损失。”
    巩固教学阵地，提高讲师质量，是进一步开展全民学哲学运动的关键所在。我们在这个工作中获得了以下一些主要经验。
    一、抓公社党校，巩固教学阵地，采用更适应生产需要的教学形式。我区乡党校是在6月间办起来的。在公社化以后，党校必须改变原来的系统，以适应新的要求。部分县已经整顿了党校组织。云肖红旗人民公社成立公社党校，大队成立分校，公社党委指定一个副书记负责领导党校工作，另指定一个干部驻扎公社党校，把党校当作政治思想工作的试验田，以指导推动全面工作。在教学形式上，采取小集中、短期集中的办法，一般都是以公社为单位集中学习半天、一天到一天半，或以大队为单位在晚上或早上集中学习。东山樟塘生产团集中讲师骨干在营里一起睡觉，每天早上学习二小时，进行了十八天的学习，既搞好了学习又搞好了生产。海澄县建立三十三个讲师辅导传授站，以便及时训练讲师。
    二、分批分级训练讲师，讲师分工包干业余学校。群众学哲学运动的深入开展，要求不断提高讲师水平，否则运动就会停顿。有些讲师反映：“要不提高一步，讲下去群众就不爱听了。”为了能迅速全面地训练讲师，云肖采用分批分级训练的办法，母鸡孵小鸡，一生十、十生百。公社党校每个月学习两次，分批训练第一把手的讲师，让他们回到分校负责全面训练讲师的工作。红旗公社党校训练了八十二名讲师，他们回到分校就把一千一百名讲师全都进行了训练。海澄县把讲师按系统（青年、妇女、民兵）按业余学校进行分工包干，这样做既保证了普及，又保证了讲师的提高和讲师骨干的成长。
    三、开讲坛，设擂台，讲师比武，共同提高。要提高讲师水平，一方面要让他们多接受一些理论知识，但多给不是一下子讲几个钟头，讲一整套，而是要下毛毛雨；另一方面要让他们学会创造性地讲授理论，学会根据实际情况，运用群众的实际经验来解释理论原理。讲师的水平总是不一致的，因此，采用讲演比赛的形式，既可以充分发挥群众性的互相学习、互相教育的作用，又可以激发讲师力争上游的决心，这是提高讲师质量的多快好省的办法。
