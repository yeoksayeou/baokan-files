	One Step Proactive, Every Step Proactive
	If someone asks: Rural production is so intense right now, and there is so much grain this year, can the grain delivery task be completed quickly? The news published in today's newspaper that Heilongjiang Province completed the purchase of over 9.3 billion jin of grain more than two months ahead of schedule compared to previous years is a resounding answer. Heilongjiang Province has a rural population of 9 million, with less than 5 million male and female laborers. In previous years, the grain purchase task was always dragged on until the spring of the following year. This year, after the autumn harvest, with the same people, in just over a month, they unprecedentedly deep-plowed 70 to 80 million mu of land, and also extracted 700,000 to 800,000 young and middle-aged farmers to smelt iron, while also squeezing out time to send 9.3 billion jin of purchased grain to the state granaries. It is clear that the problem lies in both hard work and clever work.
	The fact that Heilongjiang Province completed the grain purchase task ahead of schedule also shows that: seizing gaps, squeezing time, and completing the grain purchase task with short and intensive bursts are very beneficial to the central task. Grain always has to be brought in. If it is carried out according to routine, it will always compete with production for time and labor, focusing on two things at once, which will instead affect the central task. Now that the grain has been delivered in a concentrated effort, we have gained the initiative in production; we can devote all our efforts to large-scale water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, and large-scale fertilizer production. This is called one step proactive, every step proactive.

    一步主动步步主动
    如果有人问：目前农村生产那样紧张，今年的粮食又那样多，能不能迅速完成送粮任务呢？今天本报发表的黑龙江省比往年提前两个多月送完了九十三亿多斤征购粮的消息，是一声响亮的回答。黑龙江省农村人口共九百万，男女劳动力不到五百万人，在往年，征购粮任务总是拖到第二年春天才能完成。今年秋收后，人还是原来的人，才一个多月的时间，却破天荒地深翻了七八千万亩土地，还抽出了七八十万青壮年农民去炼铁，同时又挤出了时间，把九十三亿多斤征购粮送到了国家粮库。可见，问题在于既要苦干又要巧干。
    黑龙江省提前完成征购粮任务的事实，也说明了：抓空隙，挤时间，用短促突击的办法完成征购粮任务，对中心工作是十分有利的。粮食总是要收进来的，如果按常规进行，就老是和生产争时间，争劳动力，一心挂两头，反而影响中心工作。现在一场突击送完了粮食，就争取到生产上的主动；就可以腾出全力来大搞今冬明春的水利工程，大搞肥料。这就叫做一步主动，步步主动。
