    New "Gunners" from the Capital
    Collective Interview by Frontline Reporters
    During the time the literary and art circles were on the Fujian Frontline to offer their regards, they brought great encouragement to the heroic soldiers of the three services. What the soldiers especially remembered was that the members of the delegation fought alongside them and celebrated victory together.
    On a moonlit night, Tian Jian, the deputy head of the literary and art circles' Fujian Frontline慰问团 (comforting delegation), led writers, musicians, and artists into the gun positions amidst the warm welcome of the gunners. That night, they were there to be "new recruits," to punish the enemy with their own hands. At 9:45 PM, an order to shell a certain military target on Little Kinmen came from the position. Tian Jian, Sun Futian, and others, like the soldiers, held the firing cord in their hands, focusing intently on the squad leader's commands. They were both happy and nervous. In an instant, the command "Fire!" came from the telephone headset, and a burst of artillery fire shook the earth as all the guns fired simultaneously.
    "Good! You fired well!" the gunners praised.
    Wei Jinzhi, Chen Xiaoyu, Qu Xixian, Mi Gu, Zheng Lücheng, and others, with the permission of the military leaders, also pulled the firing cord and fired the artillery. The gun position was filled with heat, and everyone was exceptionally excited. They said that people who are accustomed to fighting with pens also fought with artillery. Even if it was a brief moment, it was worth cherishing. After firing the artillery, many people wrote poems. Tian Jian wrote a poem on the lid of an ammunition box, and Mi Gu drew a cannon in the lower right of the poem. Quyi actress Liu Shuzhen asked the squad leader to write an inscription for her as a souvenir. Squad leader Tang Yongfa wrote in her notebook: "You fired very well, good enough to be an artilleryman." Liu Shuzhen immediately wrote in the squad leader's notebook: "Comrade Squad Leader, if the motherland needs me, please give the order!"
    The delegation performed many programs for the soldiers on the spot.
    At another artillery position, the literary and art workers led by Xue Enhou, the deputy head of the Capital Literary and Art Circles' Fujian Frontline Performance慰问团 (comforting delegation), were also approved to participate in the battle. Xue Enhou, who was over fifty years old, put his left hand on his waist and held the firing cord in his right hand, looking like a skilled veteran, waiting for the squad leader's firing command. When the squad leader shouted: "For the socialist motherland, for the liberation of Kinmen and Taiwan, fire!" In an instant, sparks flashed, gunpowder smoke filled the air, and the shells were fired. As soon as the sound subsided, Xue Enhou reported to the squad leader: "Firing completed!" A burst of applause rang out on the artillery ground. The squad leader said to Xue Enhou: "You fired well!" Deputy Head Xue replied with a smile: "Not as capable as you are, we are here to learn. Once the motherland needs me, I will also sign up to be an artilleryman." The soldiers all laughed heartily. Then, Xi Yang, Mei Qian, Meng Xifei and others from the delegation also participated in the shelling.
    When the comrades of the delegation left the position, the soldiers reluctantly sent them to the car. After the car started, Squad Leader Wang Yunshui shouted loudly: "Please tell the people of the capital to produce with peace of mind, we are here on the front line..."

    来自首都的新“炮手”
    前线记者集体采访
    文艺界在福建前线慰问的日子里，给英雄的三军战士带来了极大的鼓舞，特别使战士们念念不忘的，是慰问团人员和战士们并肩作战，一起欢庆胜利。
    在一个月色溶溶的夜里，文艺界福建前线慰问团副团长田间率领的作家、音乐家、艺术家，在炮手们热情欢迎中进入了炮位。这晚，他们是来当“新兵”的，要亲手惩罚敌人。九时三刻，阵地上传来炮击小金门某军事目标的命令。田间、孙福田等像战士一样，手握拉火绳，全神注视着班长的口令。他们又是欢喜，又是紧张。霎时，电话耳机中传来了“放”的命令，一阵炮声震天动地，各炮同时开了火。
    “好！你们打得好！”炮手们赞扬着。
    魏金枝、陈笑雨、瞿希贤、米谷、郑律成等接着在部队首长准许下，也拉绳开了炮。炮位里热气腾腾，大家异常兴奋。他们说，习惯于用笔进行战斗的人，也用大炮进行战斗，纵然是短暂的一瞬，也很值得珍惜。打完炮后，许多人写了诗。田间在一块炮弹箱盖上挥笔题了一首诗，米谷在诗的右下方画了一门大炮。曲艺演员刘淑贞要求班长给她题词留念。班长汤永发在她的小本子上写道：“你打得很好，够个炮兵。”刘淑贞立即在班长的本子上写道：“班长同志，假如祖国需要，就请你下命令吧！”
    慰问团当场为战士们表演了许多节目。
    在另一个炮兵阵地上，首都文艺界福建前线演出慰问团副团长薛恩厚率领的文艺工作者，也被批准参加了战斗。五十多岁的薛恩厚，左手叉着腰，右手握着拉火绳，很像熟练的老兵，等待着班长的发射命令。当班长喊出：“为祖国社会主义，为解放金门、台湾，开炮！”霎时，火花耀眼，硝烟弥漫，炮弹发射出去了。响声刚落，薛恩厚向班长报告说：“发射完毕！”炮地上响起一片掌声。班长对薛恩厚说：“打得好！”薛副团长笑着回答：“没有你们能干啊，我们是来学习的。一旦祖国需要，我也要报名当一名炮兵。”战士们都呵呵地笑起来了。接着，慰问团的希扬、梅阡、孟希非等也都参加了炮击。
    当慰问团同志离开阵地的时候，战士们恋恋不舍地把他们送上汽车。班长王云水在汽车开动以后，还大声喊道：“请告诉首都人民，放心生产吧，前线有我们……”
