Demanding Electricity from the Sea Tide
Yǔ Pǔ

The Qiantang River's tidal bore has always been known as one of China's great scenic wonders. However, in the near future, the Qiantang River's tidal bore will not only serve as a spectacle for people to admire, but will also be harnessed as a tremendous force, obediently serving China's socialist construction.

The tidal bore at the mouth of the Qiantang River contains enormous power; the average difference between high and low tide levels is five to six meters. If a 33-kilometer-long dam is built at Zhapu to control the tidal waters, the regulated seawater could drive dozens of hydro-generators with a total capacity of 7.7 million kilowatts, generating 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year.

Tidal power generation is a new science and technology that utilizes the water level difference caused by the rise and fall of tides to drive hydro-generator sets to generate electricity. Tidal phenomena are formed by the attraction of the sun and moon on the Earth's seawater. Due to the periodic changes in the relative positions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, the total attraction on the seawater varies. When the attraction increases, the seawater rises; when the attraction decreases, the seawater falls. Within one solar day (24 hours and 50 minutes per solar day), seawater rises and falls twice. The rise during the day is called "chao" (潮, tide), and the rise at night is called "xi" (汐, tide). If a dam is used to separate a coastal river channel or bay/depression from the sea, it becomes a reservoir. A gap is left in the middle of the dam, and a hydro-generator set is installed in the gap. When the tide rises, the sea level is higher than the reservoir level, and a large amount of seawater flows into the reservoir from the gap, driving the turbine to rotate. The turbine then drives the generator to generate electricity. When the tide falls, the water level in the reservoir is higher than the sea level, and seawater flows from the reservoir into the sea through the gap, again driving the generator in the opposite direction to generate electricity. In this way, with the ebb and flow of the sea, the power station continuously sends out electricity.

The Qiantang River is not the only place in China where tidal power can be utilized. Along China's more than 11,000-kilometer coastline, the coast is winding, and bays intersect, containing rich tidal power resources. According to incomplete estimates by survey departments, the total potential reaches 110 million kilowatts, and more than 80% of it is concentrated in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. Preliminary estimates suggest that about 34 million kilowatts can be developed and utilized, equivalent to the generating capacity of two Yangtze River Three Gorges Dams.

Tidal power generation takes the sea as its source and river mouths as reservoirs, so it does not require the submergence of large areas of land and towns like building reservoirs for power generation on ordinary rivers. Unlike rivers, which have dry seasons and flood seasons, and years of abundance and years of scarcity, making it difficult to grasp the规律of water volume, its tides rise and fall periodically, and the changes are very regular. These are its advantages.

Currently, a through-flow turbine suitable for tidal power generation has been trial-produced. This type of hydro-generator set can generate electricity in the forward direction when the tide rises and in the opposite direction when the tide falls. When the tide reaches its peak or drops to its lowest point, the generator set can also be turned into pumping equipment, pumping water from the sea to the reservoir or from the reservoir to the sea. In addition, when the unit is not working, the turbine can also be used as a spillway, discharging a large amount of water flow and creating favorable conditions for generating more electricity.

Tidal power stations, if used in conjunction with thermal power systems, can exert their function even greater. A 3-million-kilowatt tidal power station with an annual power generation of 6 billion kilowatt-hours can replace 2.2 million tons of high-quality coal saved by thermal power plants each year. If used in coordination with hydropower, it can supplement the power output of hydropower and correspondingly increase the power generation capacity of hydropower. In addition, pumped storage can also be used under suitable conditions.

Tidal power generation also has some problems that need to be solved. For example, the tide rises and falls from time to time, and the head fluctuates, causing the generator to operate in an unstable state, and the electricity generated is also sometimes more and sometimes less. Another difficulty is that the flow rate during power generation is large, the head is low, and the direction of the water flow often changes. At high tide, seawater flows into the reservoir, and at low tide, seawater flows from the reservoir back into the sea. Therefore, generators and turbines working under these complex conditions not only require a larger volume, but also need to be able to adapt to work conditions that are far more complex than those of ordinary hydroelectric power stations. These shortcomings can be compensated to varying degrees if they are used in conjunction with hydropower and thermal power systems.

    向海潮要电
    雨普
    钱塘江的海潮，向来是作为我国的一大名胜而闻名的。可是不久的将来，钱塘江的海潮，不仅作为一个奇景供人一赏了事，而且还要作为巨大的动力，驯服地为我国的社会主义建设服务了。
    钱塘江口的海潮里蕴藏着巨大的动力，涨潮落潮的水位平均相差五、六公尺。如果在乍浦修筑一道三十三公里长的拦江大坝将潮水加以控制，被管制起来的海水就可带动总容量为七百七十万瓩的数十台水轮发电机发电。一年可发电二百亿度。
    潮汐发电是一门新的科学技术，它是利用海水涨落所造成的水位落差冲动水轮发电机组来发电的。潮汐现象是地球上的海水受到太阳和月球的吸引而形成的。由于地球与月球、太阳的相对位置作周期性的变化，海水所受的总吸引力也就时大时小。吸力增大时，海水上涨；吸力减小时，海水下降。在一个太阳日内（二十四小时五十分为一个太阳日）海水有两次涨落。白天上涨称为潮，晚间上涨称为汐。如果用一道大坝将靠海的河道或海湾、洼地同大海隔开，就成为水库，大坝中间留一个缺口，在缺口上安上水轮发电机组。当海水涨潮时，海面高于水库水面，大量的海水从缺口流进水库冲动水轮机旋转，水轮机就带动发电机发出电来。落潮时，水库的水面高于海面，海水又从水库通过缺口流入大海，又从相反的方向带动机组发电。如此，海水一涨一落，电站就源源地送出电来。
    我国能利用海潮发电的地方，远不止钱塘江一处。在我国一万一千多公里长的海岸线上，海岸曲折，港湾交叉，蕴藏着丰富的潮汐动力资源。根据勘测部门不完全的估计，达到一亿一千万瓩，而且80％以上集中在浙江、福建两省。初步估计，其中可以开发利用的约在三千四百万瓩以上。相当于两个长江三峡那么大的发电能力。
    潮汐发电以海为源，以河口为水库，所以不像在一般河道上修筑水库发电那样，需要淹没大量的土地和村镇。潮汐不像河流那样有枯水期和洪水期，有丰水年和歉水年，很难掌握水量的规律，它的涨潮落潮都是周期性的，变化很有规律。这些都是它的优越性。
    目前已经试制出来能适应潮汐发电的贯流式水轮机，这种水轮发电机组，当海水涨潮时可以正向发电，退潮时可以相反方向发电，当涨潮达到高峰和降潮达到低峰时，发电机组又能变成抽水设备，由大海向水库或由水库向大海抽水。此外在机组停止工作时，水轮机还可当作泄水洞使用，宣泄大量水流，为多发电创造优越条件。
    潮汐电站如果和火电系统联系一起使用，就可更大地发挥它的作用。一个三百万瓩年发电量六十亿的潮汐电站，每年可代替火电节约二百二十万吨好煤。如果和水电配合使用，就可以补充水电电量，相应地增加水电的发电能力。此外在适合的条件下还可以抽水蓄能。
    潮汐发电，还有一些需要解决的问题。例如海潮时涨时落，水头忽高忽低，致使发电机的工作处于不稳定的状态，所发出的电力也是时多时少。另一个困难是，发电时的流量大、水头低，而且水流方向时常变化，上潮时海水流向水库，落潮时海水由水库又流向大海。因此，在这种复杂条件下工作的发电机和水轮机，不仅需要较大的体积，而且要求能适应比一般水电站远为复杂的工作条件。这些缺点，如果同水电、火电系统联在一起使用，就可以在不同程度上得到弥补。
