Eliminating Obstacles to the Agricultural Leap Forward
Jinzhou Prefectural Committee Criticizes Exaggerated Style

(According to Liaoning Daily news) The Jinzhou Prefectural Committee, in implementing the spirit of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee's enlarged meeting and carrying out the agricultural leap forward, has universally examined and criticized the exaggerated and false reporting style of some cadres in the deep plowing movement, improving the quality of deep plowing. As of November 7th, the entire region had completed 350,000 hectares of deep plowing, all meeting the quality requirements.

Although the deep plowing movement in the Jinzhou area started quickly and achieved certain results, due to insufficient political command and inadequate ideological mobilization, many cadres developed an exaggerated style of work that was not meticulous or in-depth. Many of the plowed lands did not meet quality requirements, and some townships and communes even reported less plowing as more, and shallow plowing as deep plowing, seriously affecting the speed and quality of the deep plowing movement. Of the 20,000 hectares of deep plowing reported by Jin County in mid-October, inspections revealed that 50% were substandard. In Chaoyang County, more than 6,000 hectares were reported as deep plowing when they were actually shallow plowing. Nineteen of the county's twenty-five people's communes had varying degrees of exaggeration and false reporting. The No. 1 and No. 2 production teams of Badao Hao Town in Heishan County even falsely reported more than 50 hectares of land that had just been picked of hawthorns as deep plowing. The Jinzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China sternly pointed out that this exaggerated style was a major enemy hindering the agricultural leap forward next year, and demanded that all localities thoroughly rectify the style of work, remove the white flags, plant the red flags, universally examine and criticize the exaggerated style of some cadres in falsely reporting the amount of deep plowing and neglecting quality, resolutely complete the deep plowing task according to quality and quantity, and ensure a thorough and great leap forward in agricultural production next year. The Party committees of various counties and people's communes, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee, on the one hand, universally carried out debates among cadres and strictly examined and criticized the exaggerated style, and on the other hand, organized deep plowing inspection and acceptance groups (delegations). By the beginning of November, Jin County, Chaoyang, Beizhen and other eleven counties and various people's communes had successively organized inspection teams involving 28,900 people to inspect and accept the land plot by plot.

On October 25th, the Jin County Party Committee organized a large-scale debate among cadres throughout the county to criticize the exaggerated style of work, and organized 296 county, township, commune, and team inspection groups, led mainly by leading comrades of the county party committee, with more than 600 people, to go deep into the plots to accept the work. Those who passed the acceptance were issued acceptance certificates, and those who failed were ordered to rework. In addition to dispatching cadres to go deep into the countryside for comprehensive inspection, the Yi County Party Committee also held several broadcast meetings and telephone meetings, putting forward the slogan of "Opposing exaggeration and false reporting, advocating hard work and practical work, and resolutely calling for a great leap forward in all 70,000 hectares of land in the county with revolutionary spirit." Cadres in all townships and communes universally examined the exaggerated style of work. All communes in the county discovered that more than 3,000 hectares of deep plowing did not meet the quality requirements and immediately adjusted their forces to rework. According to statistics as of November 2nd, a total of more than 62,000 hectares of plowed land that did not meet the quality requirements were uncovered throughout the region through inspection and debate, and rework was carried out at the same time.

In the struggle against exaggeration, various localities also conscientiously summarized the experience of local typical townships and communes in leading deep plowing, and organized cadres to study and discuss. This not only made cadres realize the mistakes of the exaggerated style of work, but also learned good working methods through this debate, which vigorously promoted the deep plowing movement in the entire region.

    铲除农业翻身运动的障碍
    锦州地委批判虚夸作风
    据辽宁日报消息　锦州地委在贯彻辽宁省委扩大会议精神，开展农业翻身运动中，普遍检查批判了某些干部在深翻地运动中的虚夸、谎报作风，提高了深翻质量，截至11月7日，全区已完成三十五万垧深翻地，都达到了质量要求。
    锦州地区深翻地运动开始虽然进度很快，取得了一定成绩，但是由于政治挂帅不够，思想发动工作不充分，有不少干部滋长着工作不细致、不深入的虚夸作风。很多已翻的土地不合质量要求，甚至有不少乡社以少翻报多翻，以浅翻报深翻，严重地影响深翻运动的速度和质量。锦县10月中旬上报的两万垧深翻地，经检查有50％不合格。朝阳县以浅翻报深翻的就有六千多垧，该县二十五个人民公社，就有十九个公社存在着程度不同的虚夸和谎报现象。黑山县八道壕镇第一二生产队竟把刚刚挑了楂子的五十多垧土地也虚报为深翻。中共锦州地委严厉指出这种虚夸作风是妨碍明年农业翻身运动的大敌，要求各地彻底搞好整风，拔掉白旗，插上红旗，普遍检查批判某些干部中的虚报深翻数量、忽视质量的虚夸作风，坚决按质按量完成深翻任务，保证明年农业生产的彻底大翻身。各县、人民公社党委，根据省委和地委的指示，一方面在干部中普遍开展了辩论，严格地检查批判了虚夸作风，一方面组织了深翻检查验收组（团）。到11月初锦县、朝阳、北镇等十一个县和各人民公社先后组织有二万八千九百多人参加的检查组，逐块检查验收。
    锦县县委于10月25日组织全县干部进行大辩论，批判了虚夸作风，并以县委领导同志为主组织县、乡、社、队检查组二百九十六个，六百多人，深入地块验收，合格者发给验收证，不合格者令其返工。义县除抽调干部深入农村进行全面检查外，县委又几次召开了广播会、电话会，提出了“反对虚夸谎报，提倡苦干实干，以革命的气魄，坚决叫全县七万垧地大翻身”的口号，各乡社干部普遍检查了虚夸作风。全县各社发现有三千多垧地深翻不合质量要求，立即调整力量进行了返工。到11月2日统计，全区通过检查辩论，共揭发出有六万二千多垧翻地不合质量要求，同时进行了返工。
    在反对虚夸斗争中，各地还认真总结了当地典型乡社领导深翻地的经验，组织干部学习讨论，不仅使干部认识到虚夸作风的错误，还通过这次辩论也学到了好的工作方法，有力地推进了全区的深翻地的运动。
