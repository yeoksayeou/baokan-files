Buying Votes, Rigging Elections - Tycoon Manipulates “Democracy”
Rockefeller Buys Governorship with Money

(Report from our newspaper) The American plutocrat Nelson Rockefeller recently defeated the Democrat Harriman in the recent American local elections and grabbed the position of Governor of New York State. How did Rockefeller achieve his victory? An article by Drew Pearson, a New York correspondent, published in the "Washington Post" on November 1st revealed the inside story: Rockefeller, who owns a fortune of ten billion dollars, was elected with money.

Pearson wrote that, according to some experts who study election campaigns, Rockefeller spent $2 million on this campaign. That's about fifty cents for every vote he got in New York State. It is said that this is an unprecedented record.

Pearson also reported that Rockefeller spent about $60,000 a day on television in the last week of the campaign. "Rockefeller took out a full-page advertisement just to announce twelve phone numbers, which people could call to get Rockefeller's printed answers to certain questions..."

The capital that Rockefeller spent to step onto the American political stage (running for Governor of New York is just a stepping stone for him to enter the White House) is far more than this. The Rockefeller family has long made political investments in various aspects, generously donating to so-called charitable causes to buy people's hearts. Not long ago, he donated $1.5 million to the Catholic charitable organization in Tarrytown. Rockefeller even spent a lot of money to buy off people who were useful to his campaign or might hinder him. Dick Ample of "The New York Times" was "leased" to Rockefeller at an annual salary of $25,000. As a result, "The New York Times" often published news favorable to Rockefeller. Rockefeller donated $40,000 to the Truman Library, so "even Truman, who came to New York to campaign for his old friend Harriman, could only give Nelson a very light blow. When Truman and Harriman asked Anna Rosenberg, a lifelong Democrat, to conduct a more active campaign for Harriman, she hesitated. Truman had made her the first female Assistant Secretary of Defense in history. But the Rockefeller family and the Whitney family hired her as a labor consultant for $200,000."

A poem proves it:
　　What is American "democracy" like?
　　With money, you can make the devil push the millstone;
　　Rockefeller becomes governor,
　　All the votes depend on more money. (Attached image)

### 投票收买选票　财主玩弄“民主”  洛克菲勒靠钱当选州长

    投票收买选票　财主玩弄“民主”
    洛克菲勒靠钱当选州长
    本报讯　美国大财阀纳尔逊·洛克菲勒在最近的美国地方选举中，击败了民主党的哈里曼，把纽约州州长的位置抢到了手。洛克菲勒是怎样取得了胜利的呢？“华盛顿邮报”11月1日发表德鲁·皮尔逊的一篇纽约通讯揭穿了个中内幕：拥有十亿美元家财的洛克菲勒是靠了钱当选的。
    皮尔逊写道，据一些研究竞选运动的专家们估计，洛克菲勒这次竞选花掉了二百万美元。计在纽约州所得的每张选票，花了五角的代价。据说这是空前的纪录。
    皮尔逊还报道说：洛克菲勒在竞选最后一个星期中用在电视方面的钱，每天就达六万美元左右。“洛克菲勒登了整版的广告仅仅是为了宣布十二个电话号码，人们可以打这些电话得到洛克菲勒对某些问题的印好的答复。……”
    洛克菲勒为了登上美国的政治舞台（竞选纽约州长不过是他进入白宫的一个阶梯）所花的本钱远不止这一些。洛克菲勒家族早就在各方面进行了政治投资，慷慨地捐款来做所谓慈善事业，来收买人心。不久以前还捐给了塔利城的天主教慈善团体一百五十万美元。洛克菲勒甚至用了许多钱去收买对他竞选有用或者可能妨碍他的人。“纽约时报”的迪克·安普尔以年薪二万五千美元的价格“出租”给洛克菲勒。这样，“纽约时报”就经常登载有利于洛克菲勒的消息。洛克菲勒捐给了杜鲁门图书馆四万美元，因此“甚至是到纽约来为老友哈里曼竞选的杜鲁门也只能给纳尔逊一个很轻的打击。当杜鲁门和哈里曼要求终身的民主党人安娜·罗森堡为哈里曼进行更积极的活动时，她犹豫不决。杜鲁门曾使她成为历史上的第一个女的国防部助理部长。但是洛克菲勒家族和惠特尼家族给她二十万美元聘请她担任劳工顾问”。
    有诗为证：
    美国“民主”究若何，
    有钱能使鬼推磨；
    洛克菲勒当州长，
    得票全靠钞票多。（附图片）
