    "Three-izations" and "One-ization"
    Zhong Xia
  At a county committee meeting, I heard the following story: A village established a communal dining hall, but the dining hall was too far from the residents, and the masses felt it was very inconvenient and hoped to change this situation. The village cadres immediately studied the opinions of the masses and, based on feasibility, set up separate dining halls in more concentrated residential areas, which everyone found convenient and praised the commune. When discussing leadership experience, the village cadres said, "There's no magic formula, just listen to the people's feedback."
    "Listen to feedback" sounds like a very ordinary thing, but in essence, it is a major matter related to the consolidation of the commune. Of course, listening to the opinions of the masses is only one aspect of democratic work style. To truly achieve democratic management, much effort is required in many aspects, and this small matter also illustrates how important it is to realize democratic management for consolidating the commune.
    Organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization are new changes in rural life during the Great Leap Forward. To achieve the leap forward targets and build a better life, the farmers demanded that their team be a collective with strong combat effectiveness, so the "three-izations" emerged "as the times required."
    The "three-izations" are a reflection of the demands of the masses and a new creation of the peasant masses in the new situation.
    In real life, we have seen the superiority of the "three-izations," and we have seen the tremendous combat power displayed by the formerly scattered farmers after the "three-izations." Squads, platoons, companies, and battalions are neatly arranged. Wherever the Party committee points, the masses work. The brilliant achievements on the industrial and agricultural fronts are, in a sense, inseparable from the "three-izations."
    The "three-izations" themselves are a unity of opposites, a combination of democracy and concentration. In the specific implementation process, if we do not pay attention to promoting democracy, do not discuss matters with the masses, or even use militarization as a pretext to implement coercive orders, then the "three-izations" may transform to the opposite side, from the demands of the masses to something that the masses dislike or even fear. Therefore, the "three-izations" must be supplemented by "one-ization" – democratization – to truly achieve the purpose of mobilizing and organizing the masses to complete construction tasks.
    The "three-izations" have become a common form for leaders to organize farmers' production and life in the vast countryside. Many leading cadres use them skillfully. Why add "one-ization" again? Some people are still not clear about this. For example, some people say that after communization, everything is directed by the commune, eating and working, doing whatever is directed, which is much easier to lead than before.
    Indeed, after realizing communization, farmers have become more trusting in the leadership of the Party. They yearn for socialism and entrust everything to socialism. Precisely because of this, leaders have an even greater responsibility to listen to their opinions and care for their well-being. It should be said that the more the masses listen to the leaders, the more the leaders should listen to the masses!
    Some people also say that the tasks are so tight, and the commune is so big, who can take care of so many things? In fact, the tighter the tasks and the larger the scale, the more democratic management is needed. Only by leveraging the wisdom and strength of the masses can we overcome difficulties and find solutions. In fact, many tasks that seem very difficult have solutions once the masses are mobilized for discussion. It should be said that the larger the commune, the higher the degree of collectivization, and the more arduous the tasks, the more it is necessary to fully promote democracy and rely on everyone.
    Democratic management is not only a leadership method issue, but also an issue of the ideological viewpoints of the leaders. Those who do not have a mass viewpoint cannot talk about a democratic work style. Only practicing the "three-izations" without talking about democratic management, it is difficult to avoid committing commandism. From this perspective, it is not an exaggeration to say that democratic management is the soul of the "three-izations."
    The emergence of communes has changed the life habits of farmers for thousands of years. They see their bright future in this drastic change. They place their hopes and dreams in the commune. They regard the commune as their own home and obey the command of the head of the family. Therefore, every head of the family should be more considerate of the masses and listen to their opinions!
    The farmers of our country, who have suffered from feudal exploitation and the hardship of the small-scale farming economy, are only truly becoming the masters of their own destiny today. They have never been so high-spirited and enthusiastic as they are today. We should cherish the enthusiasm of the farmers a hundredfold, respect their right to be masters of their own affairs, be good managers of the big "family" of the people, and make everyone feel happy and live a joyful life!

### “三化”和“一化”

    “三化”和“一化”
    仲夏
  在一个县委会议上，我听到这样一个事例：有个村成立了食堂，但这食堂距离住户太远，群众感到很不方便，希望改变一下这种情况。这村的干部立即研究群众的意见，根据可能把食堂分开设在住户较集中的地方，于是人人称便，都说公社好。谈到领导经验时，这村的干部说，“这也没什么妙法，就是多听老百姓反映。”
    “多听反映”，说起来是件很平常的事，实质上却是有关公社巩固的大事。当然，倾听群众意见，不过是民主作风的一个方面，真正要做到管理民主化，还要做许多方面的努力，而这件小事也说明实现民主管理对于巩固公社是多么重要。
    组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化，这是大跃进中农村生活发生的新变化，为了实现跃进指标，为了建设美好的生活，农民们要求自己的队伍是一个有强大战斗力的集体，于是“三化”就“应运而生”。
    “三化”是群众要求的体现，是农民群众在新形势下的新创造。
    在现实生活中，我们看到了“三化”的优越性，看到了向称散漫的农民在“三化”后所发挥的巨大战斗力，班排连营，阵容整齐，党委指到哪里，群众干到哪里，工农业战线上所取得的辉煌成就，在某种意义上说，和“三化”是不可分的。
    “三化”本身是个矛盾统一体，是民主与集中的结合。在具体执行的过程中，如果不注意发扬民主，有事不和群众商量，甚至假借军事化之名，行强迫命令之实，那“三化”就有可能向另一面转化，由群众的要求变成群众讨厌甚至惧怕的东西。因此，“三化”必须加“一化”——民主化，才能真正达到发动群众组织群众完成建设任务的目的。
    “三化”在广大农村已经成为领导组织农民生产和生活的普遍形式，许多领导干部运用起来得心应手，为什么要再加“一化”？有些人还不大想得清楚。如有人说，公社化后，一切听社指挥，吃饭干活，指哪干哪，比以前好领导多了。
    确实是这样，实现公社化后，农民对党的领导更加信赖了，他们向往社会主义，把一切都交给社会主义。正是因为这样，领导者就更加有责任多听他们的意见，关怀他们的一切。应该这样说，群众越是听领导的话，领导者就越要多听群众的话！
    也有人说，任务这样紧，公社又这样大，谁还顾得上那许多？其实，任务紧，摊子大，更加需要管理民主化，只有发挥群众的智慧和力量，才能克服困难找出办法。事实上有很多看去十分艰巨的任务，一经发动群众讨论，就有了办法。应该这样说，公社越大，集体化程度越高，任务越繁重，就越需要充分发扬民主，依靠大家。
    管理民主化，不仅只是一个领导方法问题，而且是一个领导人员的思想观点问题，没有群众观点的人，就谈不上什么民主作风。只行“三化”，不谈管理民主化，也就难保不犯命令主义。从这个意义上看，说管理民主化是“三化”的灵魂，也不为过分。
    公社的出现，改变了农民千百年来的生活习惯，他们在这个激变里看到了自己美好的未来，他们把希望和梦想寄托在公社里，他们把公社当成自己的家，一切听从当家人的指挥，因此每一个当家人就更要体贴群众，并且倾听群众的意见！
    饱受封建剥削和小农经济之苦的我国农民，只有今天才真正成为自己命运的主人，他们从来也没有今天这样意气风发，热情高涨，我们应当百倍珍视农民的热情，尊重他们当家作主的权利，当好人民这个大“家”，让人人心情舒畅，个个生活愉快！
