Jilin Hongguang and Dongfeng Communes Trial Planting Proof: Winter-Sown Sunflowers Produce More Than Spring-Sown Ones

(Our Dispatch) The winter-sown sunflowers in Hongguang and Dongfeng People's Communes in Changling County, Jilin, have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. The fourth work area of Dongfeng People's Commune harvested 1,120 jin of sunflower seeds from seven mu of winter-sown sunflowers, averaging more than 1,600 jin per hectare, an increase of 113% compared to the 750 jin per hectare from spring-sown sunflowers. The first production team of Hongguang People's Commune saw an increase of 128% in winter-sown sunflowers compared to spring-sown ones.

The successful experience created by these two People's Communes shows that winter-sowing sunflowers has found a new way to increase the production of oil crops. Hongguang People's Commune has grown many sunflowers every year, but the yield has been very low. The commune members said, "The sunflowers harvested every year look like a big pile, but we are afraid to weigh them. Each hectare can only harvest up to 1,000 jin, and one-third of them are empty seeds." Last autumn, the township Party committee led the commune members to discuss this issue and winter-sowed three mu of sunflowers. After a year of practice, it proved to be a success. How did they plant them?

Winter sowing of sunflowers is not a difficult task. An Fuchen, the leader of the first production team of Hongguang People's Commune, is a practitioner. He said: The sowing period for winter-sowing sunflowers last year was on November 18th. He clearly remembers that the ground had already frozen more than one finger deep at the time of sowing. At that time, it froze in the morning, but it could still thaw in the afternoon. This period is suitable for winter-sowing sunflowers. The ground must be frozen after sowing to prevent the seeds from germinating, to ensure that the seedlings emerge neatly and strongly in the coming spring. If sowing is too early, causing the seeds to germinate or partially sprout, the cold weather will inevitably cause frost damage, which will lead to a large number of missing seedlings and broken rows next year. Sowing too late is also not good, because the ground freezes too thickly, causing many difficulties for sowing. They believe that correctly grasping the sowing period is the key issue for winter-sowing sunflowers. Winter-sowing sunflowers must also strictly select seeds, choosing plump seeds with strong germination power. The planting method is to use a large plow to sow the seeds. Last year, each hectare of land required about 30 jin of seeds. They believe that if we follow the requirements of close planting to increase production, winter-sowing sunflowers must appropriately increase the seeds by two to three times more than spring sowing, to ensure full seedlings and achieve increased production. After sowing, appropriate compaction should be done. The winter-sown sunflowers in Hongguang People's Commune were not rolled last year because the land was subject to wind erosion (often exposed to wind), but they were compacted in early spring. The number of hoeing and weeding times and field management are the same as for spring sowing. The commune members of Hongguang People's Commune believe that winter-sowing sunflowers is not difficult. As long as we break superstitions, correctly grasp the sowing period, and strengthen field management, we will definitely increase production more than spring sowing.

    吉林红光、东风两社试种证明：向日葵冬种比春种增产大
    本报讯　吉林长岭县红光、东风人民公社，冬种的向日葵获得了空前的大丰收。东风人民公社第四作业区冬种的七亩向日葵，实收葵花子一千一百二十斤，平均每公顷打一千六百多斤，比春种每公顷产七百五十斤，增产113％。红光人民公社第一生产队冬种的四亩向日葵，比春种的增产128％。
    这两个人民公社创造出来的成功的经验表明，冬种向日葵给油料作物的增产，找到了新途径。红光人民公社历年都种植许多向日葵，可是产量很低，社员们说：“每年收的向日葵，看堆真不小，就怕上秤量，每公顷最多能收一千多斤，秕粒占三分之一。”去年秋，乡党委领导社员讨论了这个问题，并冬种了三亩向日葵，经过一年的实践证明，获得了成功。他们是怎么种的呢？
    冬播向日葵并不是什么困难事。红光人民公社第一生产队长安福臣是个实践者，他说：去年冬播向日葵的播种时期是在11月18日，他很清楚地记忆着，在播种的当时大地已上了一指多冻，那时候上午上冻，可是下午还能解冻。这个时期冬播向日葵是合适的。播种后地必须冻上，使种子不发芽，才能保证来春苗齐苗壮。如果播种过早，使种子萌动或有部分发芽，以后天气一冷势必受到冻害，这样就要造成明年的大量缺苗断条；播种太晚也不好，因为地冻厚了，给播种造成很多困难。他们认为正确掌握播种时期是冬播向日葵的关键问题。冬种向日葵还必须严格选种，选成实、发芽力强的种子做种。种植方法是采取大犁扣种的，去年每公顷地需要三十斤左右种子。他们认为如果按密植增产的要求，冬种向日葵必须比春播的适当增加种子两三倍，才能确保全苗，达到增产。播种后应该适当的镇压，红光人民公社冬种的向日葵，因为地跑风（常受风剥）去年播后没有压磙子，是早春镇压的。铲趟次数和田间管理都和春种的一样。红光人民公社的社员们认为，冬种向日葵并没有难处，只要破除迷信，正确掌握播种时期，加强田间管理，就一定比春种的多增产。
