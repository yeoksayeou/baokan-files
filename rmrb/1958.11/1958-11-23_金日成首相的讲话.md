Premier Kim Il-sung's Speech

Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, dear comrades and friends:

First of all, I would like to express my deep gratitude to you for your sincere hospitality.

On our way to Beijing, we have been warmly welcomed by the fraternal Chinese people. We believe that this is a manifestation of the love and friendship of the Chinese people towards the Korean people.

The friendship between our two peoples has a long history and is forged in blood.

Our two peoples, in the great family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, are closely united on the basis of the principles of proletarian internationalism, supporting and assisting each other. This friendship is an invincible force, which was even more evident during the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of US imperialism.

In our most difficult times, the Chinese people sent their outstanding sons and daughters to the Korean front to aid us with their blood.

The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, valiantly fought the aggressors, thus defending the highlands and villages of our motherland and establishing various great achievements. The Korean people will never forget their great contributions. The Chinese People's Volunteers made great contributions to the security of the Korean people and to the lasting peace in the Far East and the world. Their achievements will shine forever in the history of progressive mankind.

The Chinese people have given tremendous material and spiritual assistance to the socialist construction of the Korean people, which has become a tremendous force in the rapid recovery and development of our national economy.

The Chinese people actively support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country, and have consistently made sincere efforts for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

The Chinese People's Volunteers' initiative to withdraw from Korea has opened up a new situation for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and for easing the tense situation in the Far East.

However, the US imperialist aggressors, disregarding the peace-loving measures taken by the Korean and Chinese peoples, not only refuse to withdraw from the southern half of our country, but also blatantly pursue a policy of aggression.

US troops must withdraw from Korea immediately. Only when the US imperialist aggressor troops withdraw from South Korea can the peaceful reunification of Korea be realized, the peace of Korea be consolidated, and the Korean issue be peacefully resolved by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis without any foreign interference.

Today, US imperialists are plotting various conspiracies and tricks in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and other parts of the world in order to undermine peace. They are rearming West Germany and reviving Japanese militarism to create international tension. The US imperialists are carrying out new provocative activities against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait.

The Korean people believe that any act of aggression against the Chinese people is a threat to the Korean people; the Korean people resolutely condemn the US imperialist schemes of war provocation.

In the struggle against US imperialist aggression and in defense of peace, the Korean people will always stand firmly with the Chinese people.

The peoples of Korea and China, on the road to achieving the common goals of peace and socialism, will always be cooperating brothers and comrades-in-arms sharing a common destiny.

We will do everything in our power to consolidate the militant friendship with the Chinese people.

Comrades, friends:

This visit to China is particularly pleasant and exciting for us. This is because our two peoples are advancing by leaps and bounds in socialist construction, and we are conducting our friendly visit in an atmosphere of striving for unprecedented great achievements.

Now, the Chinese people, following the general line of socialist construction put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, are rapidly transforming their country from a weak agricultural country into a socialist power with advanced industry and agriculture.

The creative wisdom and talents of the 650 million Chinese people, who have been oppressed for a long time, are now exerting infinite and great power. All facts undoubtedly prove that the Chinese people's grand plan to catch up with Britain in the production of important industrial products within fifteen years will surely be realized in the coming years. Due to such great achievements, the power of the People's Republic of China is rapidly growing and strengthening, and its international prestige is also increasing day by day. This is an important contribution to further strengthening the forces of peace and socialism, and a tremendous source of encouragement to the Korean people.

Through this visit, we will learn more from your Great Leap Forward movement.

In the name of the Korean people, I warmly wish the fraternal Chinese people greater achievements in their future cause of building socialism.

I propose:

For the close unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union;

For the eternal and indestructible friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China;

For the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China;

For the health of Comrade Mao Zedong;

For the health of Comrade Zhou Enlai;

To the health of all comrades and friends present,

Cheers!

### 金日成首相的讲话

专栏：

    金日成首相的讲话尊敬的周恩来总理同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我首先向你们表示深深的感谢，感谢你们对我们这样至诚的款待。
    我们在来北京的路上一直受到了兄弟般的中国人民的热烈欢迎。我们认为，这是中国人民对朝鲜人民的热爱与友情的表现。
    我们两国人民之间的友谊有着悠久的历史，并且是由鲜血凝结而成的。
    我们两国人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭里，在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上，紧紧地团结在一起，互相支持和互相援助。这种友谊是战无不胜的力量，它在朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义武装侵略的祖国解放战争时期，更明显地表现出来了。
    在我们处在最艰苦的时期，中国人民派遣自己的优秀儿女到朝鲜前线，以鲜血援助了我们。
    中国人民志愿军官兵，同朝鲜人民军一道，英勇地打击侵略者，从而捍卫了我们祖国的高地和乡村，建立了各种丰功伟绩。他们的伟大功绩，朝鲜人民将永志不忘。中国人民志愿军为朝鲜人民的安全，而且为远东和世界的持久和平，作出了巨大贡献。他们的业绩，将在进步人类的历史上永放光芒。
    中国人民为朝鲜人民的社会主义建设，给予了物质和精神上的莫大援助，这在我国人民经济的迅速恢复发展上，成了巨大的力量。
    中国人民积极支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗争，并且为朝鲜问题的和平解决，始终一贯地作出了真挚的努力。
    中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜，为朝鲜问题的和平解决，为缓和远东的紧张局势，打开了新的局面。
    然而，美帝国主义侵略者不顾朝中人民已采取了爱好和平的措施，不仅不撤出我们祖国的南半部，而且更加露骨地推行着侵略政策。
    美军必须立即撤出朝鲜。只有美帝国主义侵略军队撤出南朝鲜，朝鲜的和平统一才能得到实现，朝鲜的和平才能得到巩固，朝鲜问题，必须在没有任何外国干涉的条件下，在民主基础上，由朝鲜人民自己和平解决。
    今天，美帝国主义者为了破坏和平，在亚洲、欧洲和中近东等世界各地，策划着各种阴谋诡计。它们正在重新武装西德和复活日本军国主义来造成国际紧张局势。美帝国主义者在台湾海峡进行着反对中国人民的新的挑衅活动。
    朝鲜人民认为，任何反对中国人民的侵略行为，都是对朝鲜人民的威胁；朝鲜人民坚决谴责美帝国主义的战争挑衅阴谋。
    在反对美帝国主义的侵略和维护和平的斗争中，朝鲜人民将永远同中国人民坚定地站在一起。
    朝中两国人民，在实现和平和社会主义的同一目的的道路上，永远是互相合作的兄弟，永远是共命运的战友。
    我们为了巩固同中国人民的战斗友谊，将竭尽自己的全部力量。
    同志们，朋友们：
    这次我们在中国的访问，特别愉快、兴奋。这是因为，我们两国人民在社会主义建设中，同样飞跃地前进，在争取从未有过的伟大成就的高涨的气氛中，进行着我们的友好访问。
    现在，中国人民沿着中国共产党提出的社会主义建设总路线，正在把自己的祖国从薄弱的农业国迅速地转变为具有先进的工业和农业的社会主义大强国。
    遭到长期压迫的六亿五千万中国人民创造性的智慧和才能，今天发挥着无穷无尽的伟大力量。一切事实无可置疑地证明，中国人民在重要工业产品的生产方面，十五年内赶上英国的宏伟计划，一定会在今后几年内得到实现。由于这样巨大的成就，中华人民共和国的威力在迅速地壮大和加强，它的国际威望也在日益提高。这在进一步加强和平和社会主义的力量上，是个重要的贡献，对朝鲜人民来说，是个巨大的鼓舞的力量。
    我们通过这次的访问，在你们的大跃进运动中，将学到更多东西。
    我以朝鲜人民的名义，热烈地祝愿兄弟般的中国人民在建设社会主义的今后事业中，取得更大的成就。
    我建议：
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的紧密团结；
    为朝中两国人民永恒不灭的友谊团结；
    为中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府；
    为毛泽东同志的健康；
    为周恩来同志的健康；
    为在座的各位同志们和朋友们的健康，
    干杯！
