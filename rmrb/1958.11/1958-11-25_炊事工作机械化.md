    Mechanization of Cooking Work
    Public canteens are superior,
    Milling flour and cooking are mechanized,
    Chopping vegetables requires little effort,
    Blowing air doesn't need bellows,
    Steaming buns doesn't need kneading by hand,
    Cooking work is mechanized.

    炊事工作机械化
    公共食堂优越大，
    磨面做饭机械化，
    切菜用力小，
    吹风不用拉风箱，
    蒸馍不用手去捏，
    炊事工作机械化。
