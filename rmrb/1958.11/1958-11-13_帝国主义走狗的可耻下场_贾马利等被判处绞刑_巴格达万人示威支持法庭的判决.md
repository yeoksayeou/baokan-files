　　The Disgraceful End of Imperialist Running Dogs
　　Jamali and Others Sentenced to Hang
　　Baghdad Sees Tens of Thousands Demonstrate in Support of the Court's Verdict
　　Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, November 11th. The Iraqi Special Military Tribunal sentenced Jamali, who had served as Prime Minister and multiple times as Foreign Minister, Lieutenant General Rafiq Arif, the former Army Chief of Staff, and Major General Daghistani, the former Deputy Chief of Staff and Commander of the Third Division, to death on the evening of the 10th.

　　After hearing the radio broadcast of the court's verdict, tens of thousands of citizens took to the streets and coffee shops of Baghdad to demonstrate in support of the court's verdict. People danced in the streets, congratulating each other, and a festive atmosphere filled the city.

　　The court president, Mahdawi, made a brief speech at the opening of the court. He pointed out that the main purpose of the Iraqi revolution was to eliminate imperialism and its running dogs. The revolution ended the corrupt feudal dynasty's rule with astonishing speed. A special military tribunal was established in Iraq to deal with notorious criminals and avenge the people.

　　The court president then pointed out that all the crimes charged against the defendants in the indictment had been confirmed by witness testimony, material evidence, and the criminals' own confessions. The main crimes of the criminals were conspiring to use armed forces to overthrow the Syrian government, and they also requested assistance from the United States, Britain, and the Baghdad Pact Organization to achieve this conspiracy. Their actions endangered the security of Iraq and world peace.

　　In accordance with the provisions of the criminal law, the court sentenced these three heinous traitors to death by hanging.

　　After the verdict was announced, cheers rang out in the packed courtroom. People shouted, "Long live justice!" "Long live the Republic!"

　　Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, November 11th. "The Country Daily" published a commentary on the news that the Iraqi Special Military Tribunal sentenced former Faisal dynasty Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Jamali and other three traitors to death, saying, "This verdict is a heavy blow to imperialism, a serious warning to anyone who dares to betray the nation and the country, and also a warning to the remaining traitors in the Arab countries."

　　The commentary said that after the court's verdict, the Iraqi people held demonstrations and sent telegrams to express their support for the verdict, which fully demonstrated that the people were very happy that these conspirators had been sentenced to death.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 11th. "Guangming Daily" published an editorial today, hailing the Iraqi military tribunal's announcement of the death sentence for Jamali and other three imperialist agents. The editorial said: "The purpose of the verdict is to eliminate the traces left by the rule of Washington and London masters in Iraq for ten years." The newspaper said that these verdicts warned the imperialists: no matter what obstacles they set up, no matter what dictatorial or violent means of oppression they adopt, they cannot stop the people who are determined to gain liberation.
