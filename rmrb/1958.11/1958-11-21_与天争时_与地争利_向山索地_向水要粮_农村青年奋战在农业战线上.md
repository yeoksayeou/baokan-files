Xinhua News Agency report: "Wherever the Party points, we rush to!" "Whatever the Party tells us to do, we do!" With such will and determination, the vast rural youth of the country, under the leadership of the Party, participated in the great leap forward in agricultural production this year. Incomplete statistics from just twenty provinces show that more than 30 million young people have formed more than 1.78 million youth shock brigades.

Last winter and this spring, during the mass movement to build water conservancy projects in rural areas, more than 85 million young people were mobilized to the water conservancy construction front every day. Many young people boldly declared that they would seize time from heaven, seize profit from earth, extract land from mountains, and demand grain from water. They tried every means to find water sources. The youth of Gansu Province successively diverted more than 130 rivers, large and small, to irrigate fields on high mountains. The youth shock brigade of the Rocket Weir in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, diverted river water over seventy-two mountains for irrigation in a short period of time. In thirteen provinces (regions) including Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Gansu, and Guangxi, the canals, reservoirs, ponds, and dams contracted by the youth numbered more than 480,000. In Yu County, Henan Province, 120,000 young people organized more than 1,200 water conservancy basic construction shock brigades, and together with the farmers of the county, tamed all 913 barren hills in the county, realizing water conservancy and greening throughout the county.

Rural youth enthusiastically participated in the manure accumulation movement to strive for a bumper grain harvest. Their achievements can be shown by this figure: the amount of manure accumulated by the youth accounts for about one-third of the total manure accumulation in rural areas nationwide. In Daxin County, Guangxi, five young people climbed a 96-zhang (approx. 320 meters) high cliff and found a large amount of fertilizer in a deep mountain cave that had not been visited for more than eighty years. In many places in Guangdong Province, young people also launched a "Nezha Stirring the Sea" movement to demand fertilizer from the sea. In Guo County, Shanxi Province, youth in twelve townships successively successfully created more than thirty kinds of local fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers.

In the great leap forward in agricultural production, rural youth not only worked hard, but also actively participated in the technical innovation movement. Under the leadership of Party and Youth League organizations, and with the help of middle-aged and elderly people, they boldly broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and created many miracles with a daring and capable style. Rural youth in twenty-one provinces including Hubei, Shanxi, Hebei, Jilin, and Guangdong planted more than 31 million mu (approx. 2066667 hectares) of experimental fields and achieved bumper harvests. In Henan Province, the youth transformed more than 2,122,000 mu (approx. 141466 hectares) of low-lying, waterlogged, and saline-alkali land. Among the seventeen high-yield "satellites" in the province with a yield of more than 4,000 jin (approx. 2000 kg) of grain per mu, thirteen were created by youth production teams. Young people took the lead in the mass movement of agricultural tool reform. According to statistics from eighteen provinces including Henan and Liaoning, youth created and innovated 33,064 kinds and 3,388,512 pieces of tools in the first half of this year alone. Mao Qichang, a youth from Cibei Commune in Taihe County, Anhui Province, created three kinds of tools, including an animal-powered urine cart, which increased work efficiency by ten to one hundred and thirty times. This year, the Institute of Agricultural Mechanization of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences hired twenty-one "native experts" as specially invited researchers, five of whom were young people under the age of thirty.

Since the beginning of autumn, the vast rural youth have actively launched a new upsurge of autumn harvest, autumn planting, deep plowing, and manure accumulation, preparing to welcome an even greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.

    与天争时　与地争利　向山索地　向水要粮
    农村青年奋战在农业战线上
    据新华社讯　“党指向哪里就奔向哪里！”“党叫干什么就去干什么！”全国广大农村青年就是以这样的意志和决心，在党的领导下参加了今年这一年农业生产大跃进的浪潮。仅据二十个省的不完全统计，就有三千多万青年组成了一百七十八万多个青年突击队。
    去冬今春农村大兴水利建设运动中，每天出动到水利建设战线上的青年共有八千五百多万人。许多青年豪迈地宣誓要与天争时，与地争利，向山索地，向水要粮。他们千方百计地寻找水源。甘肃省青年曾先后把一百三十多条大小河流引上高山灌溉田地。安徽省舒城县火箭堰的青年突击队在短短的时间内把河水引过了七十二座山用来灌溉。在山东、河南、湖北、浙江、甘肃、广西等十三个省（区），青年包修的渠、库、塘、坝有四十八万多处。河南省禹县十二万名青年组织了一千二百多个水利基本建设突击队，和全县农民一道，治好了全县九百一十三座荒山，实现了全县水利化和绿化。
    农村青年们为争取粮食大丰收而踊跃参加积肥运动。他们所创造的成就从这样一个数字中可以显示出来：青年们积肥的数量约占全国农村整个积肥量的三分之一，广西大新县五名青年攀登了九十六丈高的悬崖绝壁，在八十多年没人去过的深山岩洞找到了大量肥料。广东省许多地方的青年还展开了“哪叱闹海”的运动，向大海要肥料。山西省崞县有十二个乡的青年先后创造成功了三十多种土化肥和细菌肥料。
    各地农村青年在农业生产大跃进中不但猛干苦干，并且积极投入技术革新运动。他们在党、团组织的领导和壮年、老年人的帮助下，大胆破除迷信，解放思想，以敢想敢干的风格创造出许多奇迹。湖北、山西、河北、吉林、广东等二十一个省的农村青年共种了三千一百多万亩试验田，得到了丰收。河南省青年曾改造了低洼易涝地、盐碱地二百一十二万二千多亩，这个省亩产粮食四千斤以上的高产“卫星”共十七个，其中十三个是由青年生产队创造的。青年们在群众性的农具改革运动中更是一马当先。据河南、辽宁等十八个省统计，今年上半年青年创造革新的工具就有三万三千零六十四种、三百三十八万八千五百一十二件。安徽太和县茨北社青年毛其昌创造的畜力尿车等三种工具，提高工效十倍至一百三十倍。今年中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所聘请二十一位“土专家”为特约研究员，其中有五人是三十岁以下的青年。
    自入秋以来，广大农村青年又积极掀起了秋收秋种、深翻地和积肥的热潮，准备迎接明年农业生产的更大跃进。
