　　After the Stagnant Pool is Stirred Up
　　By Our Correspondent Pan Fei

　　De Gaulle recently fired a shot at the United States and Britain. He demanded that the United States, Britain, and France jointly take the lead in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to change the current situation where the United States or the United States and Britain monopolize everything.

　　De Gaulle's request was first revealed by a West German newspaper in late October. It is said that shortly after meeting with Dulles this summer, De Gaulle sent private letters to Eisenhower and Macmillan separately, suggesting that a political institution be established within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by representatives of the United States, Britain, and France to make it a decision-making body for Western countries in handling West European affairs and even world affairs. The content of the letters has not been published, but it is believed that in order to demonstrate the necessity of reorganizing NATO, France expressed its dissatisfaction with the US and British landing in Lebanon and Jordan without prior consultation with Paris; perhaps, the old score of the US and Britain transporting arms to Tunisia was also brought up again.

　　If, a year ago, "interdependence" was touted as the norm for mutual relations among NATO countries, then times have long since changed, and it has been discarded. A relentless debate is taking place among Washington, London, Bonn, and Paris regarding France's proposal.

　　West Germany was the first to oppose it. A spokesman for the Bonn government stated at a press conference that De Gaulle's proposal was "unacceptable." The Bonn government also hinted that West Germany would provide more divisions than France in NATO.

　　Eisenhower and Macmillan replied to De Gaulle separately last week. Although these letters have not been published word for word, it can be seen from newspaper reports that the United States and Britain's attitude towards the French proposal. On the one hand, Washington stated that it would welcome all suggestions aimed at strengthening NATO, while at the same time believing that it was "satisfied" with the current status of this military group. As for leadership, it wanted France to pay attention to the fact that the United States "bears special responsibility" for world affairs. American officials even ridiculed France, stating that as long as France has not climbed out of the quagmire of Algeria, there is no question of having a say in NATO's military issues. The British attitude was more tactful. An editorial in "The Times" explained that if De Gaulle's proposal were implemented, it would make West Germany, Italy, and other member states of NATO feel unhappy.

　　After NATO, this stagnant pool, was stirred up by France, the rotten cats and dead dogs that had settled at the bottom suddenly floated to the top again. British Field Marshal Montgomery, former Deputy Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, severely criticized NATO on October 24. He criticized NATO as a "cumbersome, unwieldy, and overstaffed" bureaucracy that caused "huge waste of financial resources and energy." Montgomery proposed another reorganization plan. He advocated moving the Standing Group of the Military Committee of NATO from Washington to Paris and appointing a French general to replace the American Norstad as "Supreme Allied Commander."

　　In December, NATO will hold a ministerial-level meeting. Now, a major debate about NATO has begun among its member states. If we add the struggle between Britain and Greece over Cyprus, the dispute over Britain's intrusion into Icelandic territorial waters, and the opposition between Britain and France on the issue of the Common Market and the Free Trade Area…, we can see that the prospects for this meeting are very bleak. The American "New York Times" has expressed its hidden worries about this, writing that the NATO member states are "more hostile to each other than they are to the Soviet Union." Therefore, American public opinion is brewing to "upgrade" this ministerial-level meeting to a "summit meeting" attended by heads of state, as it did last year. At that time, they propped up an ailing Eisenhower to Paris, temporarily calming the internal disputes of this group. However, the situation this year is very different from last year; Eisenhower's "prestige" has also declined greatly after the US midterm elections. Even if the US president personally steps forward again, this medicine may not be effective.

    臭水坑被搅拌以后
    本报记者　潘非
    戴高乐最近对美英两国放了一炮。他要求在北大西洋集团内，由美英法三国共同挂帅，以改变目前这种由美国或美英两国垄断一切的局面。
    戴高乐的要求是在10月下旬由一家西德报纸首先透露的。据说，今年夏季在与杜勒斯会谈后不久，戴高乐即分别给艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦一封私人信件，建议由美英法三国代表在北大西洋集团内部成立一个政治机构，使它成为西方国家在处理西欧事务以至世界事务中的决策机关。信的内容没有公布，但人们相信，为了论证改组北大西洋集团的必要，法国对美英登陆黎巴嫩和约旦而没有事先同巴黎协商，表示不满；或许，还把美英运送军火给突尼斯的老账又提上一笔。
    如果说，一年以前，“互相依赖”被吹捧为北大西洋集团各国间相互关系的准则，那么现在早已时过境迁，把它丢在一边。围绕着法国的建议，华盛顿、伦敦、波恩和巴黎之间，正进行着一场互不相让的争辩。
    第一个出来反对的是西德。波恩政府的发言人在一次记者招待会上表示，戴高乐的建议是“不能接受的”。波恩政府并且暗示，在北大西洋集团中，西德将比法国提供更多的师团。
    艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦在上星期分别给戴高乐回信。尽管这些信件没有只字公布，但根据报纸透露，可以看出美英对于法国建议的态度。华盛顿一方面表示，对于凡是旨在加强北大西洋集团的一切建议，都将受到美国的欢迎，同时又认为它对于这一军事集团的现状“是满意的”。至于说到领导，那末它要法国注意这样一个事实：美国对全世界的事务，“负有特殊的责任”。美国的官员甚至对法国奚落一番，表示只要法国还没有从阿尔及利亚的泥潭中爬出来，在北大西洋集团的军事问题上就谈不上什么发言权。英国的态度比较委婉一些。“泰晤士报”的一篇社论解释：如果实现戴高乐的建议，将会使西德、意大利和北大西洋集团的其他成员国感到不快。
    北大西洋集团这个臭水坑，经过法国这一搅拌以后，沉淀在下面的烂猫死狗，一下子又都浮到上面来了。英国元帅、前盟军最高副司令蒙哥马利，10月24日对北大西洋集团大骂一通。他批评北大西洋集团是个“庞杂的、笨重的、充满冗员的”官僚机构，造成“财力和精力上的巨大浪费”。蒙哥马利提出了另一个改组计划。他主张把北大西洋集团的军事委员会常设小组委员会从华盛顿搬到巴黎来，并委任一个法国将军来代替美国的诺斯塔德，充任“盟军最高总司令”。
    12月份，北大西洋集团将召开部长一级的会议。现在，一个有关北大西洋集团的大辩论，已经在各成员国中展开。如果再加上英国同希腊在塞浦路斯问题上的斗争，英国侵入冰岛领海的纷争，英法在共同市场和自由贸易区这个问题上的对立……，就可以看到，这次会议的前景是非常不妙的。美国的“纽约时报”对此已表示隐忧，它写道：北大西洋集团成员国“互相之间的敌对，甚于它们反对苏联的程度”。因此，美国舆论已在酝酿把这部长一级的会议，“提升”为有国家首脑参加的“最高级会议”，如同去年一样。那时候，他们把个正在犯病的艾森豪威尔架到巴黎，暂时平息了这个集团内部的争吵。但是，今年的情况同去年有很大不同；艾森豪威尔在美国中期选举以后，“威望”也大大下降。即使美国总统再亲自出马，这服药也未必有效。
