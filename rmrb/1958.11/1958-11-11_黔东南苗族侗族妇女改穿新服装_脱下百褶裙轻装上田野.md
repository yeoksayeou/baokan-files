Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 10th: To facilitate production labor, ethnic minority women in the Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture of Southeastern Guizhou are consciously reforming their clothing, changing their long, heavy pleated skirts into shorter skirts or trousers. During the current autumn harvest production, over 90% of young Miao and Dong women are wearing various new styles of clothing for the first time, lightly and quickly harvesting crops and deep-plowing the land in the fields.

For centuries, most Miao and Dong women in Southeastern Guizhou have worn very long, embroidered pleated skirts. These skirts take a long time to make, generally requiring four to six lengths of cloth, and are very heavy to wear, making it inconvenient to walk or work. Since the Great Leap Forward this year, all 450,000 female laborers in the prefecture have been投入 (thrown) into field production, and the old clothing cannot meet the needs. During the spring plowing season, some women's wide skirt hems were completely submerged in the mud, making it impossible to move.

In order to save manpower and time, and to facilitate production, many ethnic minority women in the autonomous prefecture have begun to brew up the idea of reforming their clothing since the summer and autumn, and voluntarily requested to change their long skirts into other suitable and beautiful clothing. With the support of Party committees and women's federations at all levels, activists among the Miao and Dong women designed a variety of different styles of clothing based on production needs and combined with the characteristics of their ethnic clothing, taking the lead in trying them on, while soliciting opinions from the masses for modifications, until everyone felt satisfied before they began to promote them. Generally, the pleated skirts are changed to ethnic-style short triangular skirts, vertical pleated skirts, or trousers. In this way, cloth and labor are saved, and it is very convenient to wear them up and down the mountains and fields. They are welcomed by Miao and Dong women in various places and are called socialist new clothing.

Since the reform of clothing is a major event in the daily life of ethnic minorities, although most young and middle-aged women strongly agree, a few women are not used to wearing trousers and short skirts, and some elderly people have many concerns. Therefore, various places have also adopted methods such as holding elderly people's meetings, women's meetings, and family meetings to explain that the reform of clothing is mainly to facilitate the development of production and is in line with the Miao and Dong people's tradition of diligence and simplicity. As for the existing embroidered long skirts, they can still be worn casually on festivals, market days, and meeting occasions.

### 黔东南苗族侗族妇女改穿新服装  脱下百褶裙轻装上田野

    黔东南苗族侗族妇女改穿新服装
    脱下百褶裙轻装上田野
    据新华社贵阳10日电　黔东南苗族、侗族自治州少数民族妇女为了便利生产劳动，自觉地改革服装，把又长又重的百褶裙改为短裙或长裤。在目前的三秋生产中，90％以上的苗族、侗族青年妇女第一次穿着各式各样的新服装，轻快地在田野里收割庄稼和深翻土地。
    黔东南的大部分苗族、侗族妇女，千百年来一直穿着很长的绣花百褶裙。这种裙子制作费时，一般需布四至六丈，穿在身上十分沉重，行走或工作都不方便。今年大跃进以来，全州四十五万妇女劳动力全部投入田间生产，旧服装不能适应需要。春耕期间，有的妇女宽大的裙边全漫在泥水里，走也走不动。
    为了节省人力和时间，有利于生产，自治州许多少数民族妇女从夏秋以来就开始酝酿改革服装，自动要求变长裙为其他适用、美观的服装。在各级党委、妇联的支持下，苗族和侗族妇女中的积极分子根据生产需要，结合本民族服装的特色，设计了多种不同式样的服装，一边带头试穿，一边征求群众意见加以修改，直到大家认为合心后，才开始推广。各地一般将百褶裙改为民族形式的短三角裙、纵褶裙，或改穿裤子。这样一来，省布又省工，穿着上山下田都很方便，受到各地苗族和侗族妇女的欢迎，被称为社会主义新服装。
    由于改革服装是少数民族人民日常生活中的一件大事，虽然大多数青壮年妇女都十分赞成，但也有少数妇女对改穿裤子、短裙不习惯，有的老年人顾虑很多。因此，各地还采取了召开老人会、妇女会、家庭会等方式，说明改革服装主要是为了便于发展生产，符合苗、侗族勤劳朴素的传统。至于已有的绣花长裙，在节日、赶场及开会等场合，自己还可以随便穿。
