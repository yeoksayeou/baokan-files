    Ten-Thousand-Ton Ships Surpass Britain
    Workers of the Body Manufacturing Workshop, Dalian Shipyard, Lu Fu, Li Renmao
    Under the cloudless, bright sky,
    Red light sparkles on the coast of the East Sea.
    Shipbuilding workers led by the Communist Party,
    Are building ten-thousand-ton ships in China.
    Shipbuilding workers are busy producing,
    Ten-thousand-ton ships must surpass the British,
    Workers toil from dawn till dusk without rest.
    Listening attentively by the shipbuilding berth,
    The "wind-drill" goes "da-da" like a machine gun,
    The sound of the sledgehammer rings out loud and clear;
    Looking up again at the high sky,
    A large plate is raised in the air,
    Cranes lift plates busily,
    Laying the keel and connecting the hull.
    Automatic welding is good and fast,
    The welding slag is uniform and bright,
    Shipbuilding workers have high enthusiasm,
    Full of energy, daring to create,
    In the past, we built small passenger boats and electric boats,
    Now it is ten-thousand-ton ships,
    Shipbuilding workers make a great leap forward,
    Surpassing Britain is not difficult.

    万吨轮船超英国
    大连造船厂造体车间工人　鲁夫、李仁茂
    万里无云晌晴的天，
    东海之滨红光闪闪，
    共产党领导造船工人，
    在中国建造万吨大船。
    造船工人生产忙，
    万吨轮船要超过英国佬，
    工人们披星戴月不停闲。
    造船台下侧耳听，
    “风把”哒哒似机枪，
    大锤声音响叮当；
    抬头又向高空看，
    一张大板空中扬，
    吊车吊板忙又忙，
    铺了船底接船帮。
    自动焊接好又快，
    焊缝的焊浆均又光，
    造船工人热情高，
    鼓足干劲敢创造，
    过去造的是客艇小电船，
    现在的是万吨轮，
    造船工人大跃进，
    超过英国不费难。
