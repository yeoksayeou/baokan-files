Jiangsu to Compile a Ten-Year History of the Province and a Historical Booklet Series

The work of collecting materials and compiling "Jiangsu History over the Past Ten Years Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China" (tentative title) and the "Jiangsu Historical Booklet Series" as a gift for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation has begun. The first draft of the Jiangsu Ten-Year History will be completed in May next year. This was determined at a recent meeting of relevant units convened by the Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee.

The meeting proposed that the compilation of history must be under the leadership of the Party, follow the mass line, in order to fully reflect the overall picture of the changes and development in various aspects of Jiangsu Province over the past ten years. The meeting believed that the strength of historical workers and history teachers in the province should be fully utilized, and the strength of the Provincial Institute of History, the Third Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences, the Nanjing Historical Data Compilation Office, the Provincial Museum, the Nanjing Library, as well as the history departments of Nanjing University, Jiangsu Normal College, Jiangsu Education College, Jiangsu Teachers College, and Subei Teachers College should be organized and invested in this work.

The meeting also initially determined more than 160 topics for the "Jiangsu Historical Booklet Series," including the development history of various cities and counties in Jiangsu Province over the past ten years, as well as the achievements in various aspects such as industry, agriculture, transportation, finance and trade, culture and education, and also including the history of typical communes, factories, mines, enterprises, farms, schools, and shops.

Currently, many units have taken action. Fourth-year students of the History Department of Nanjing University have already compiled a draft of the chronology of major events in Jiangsu history over the past ten years.

    江苏编辑全省十年史和历史小丛书
    作为建国十周年献礼的“中华人民共和国建国十年来的江苏历史”（暂定名）和“江苏历史小丛书”的搜集材料和编写工作已经开始。江苏十年史的初稿将于明年5月份完成。这是中共江苏省委宣传部最近召开的有关单位会议确定的。
    会议提出，编写历史必须在党的领导下，走群众路线，才能充分反映江苏省十年来各个方面的变化和发展的全貌。会议认为应充分发挥本省历史工作者与历史教学人员的力量，将省历史研究所、科学院历史第三所南京史料整理处、省博物馆、南京图书馆，以及南京大学、江苏师范学院、江苏教育学院、江苏师专、苏北师专的历史系科的力量组织起来，投入这一工作。
    会议还初步确定“江苏历史小丛书”的一百六十多个专题，其中包括江苏省各市县十年来的发展史，以及工业、农业、交通运输、财经贸易、文化教育等各个方面的成就，还包括典型的公社、工厂、矿山、企业、农场、学校、商店的历史。
    目前，许多单位已经行动起来。南京大学历史系四年级学生已经编好十年来江苏历史的大事表草稿。
