Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Third National Congress of the China Democratic League officially opened in Beijing this morning. How the Democratic League organizations and members can rapidly and permanently carry out fundamental transformation under the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction is the central topic of this congress.

When the Democratic League Chairman Shen Junru addressed the opening of the congress to more than 280 representatives, he said that we must successfully hold this congress and make it a turning point in the history of the Democratic League.

Shen Junru then delivered a work report to the congress on behalf of the Second Central Committee of the Democratic League. After reporting on the current international and domestic situation, he said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, using the power of the organization and the masses to help bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals accelerate the transformation of their political stance and thinking, so that they can keep up with the situation and wholeheartedly serve the implementation of the general line of socialist construction and accelerate the building of socialism, and successfully pass the socialist test, is the direction and goal of the Democratic League's current work.

In his report, Shen Junru reviewed the experiences and lessons of the Democratic League's work in the past nine years, especially from the high tide of socialist transformation to the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement. He pointed out that these experiences and lessons are mainly: truly accepting the leadership of the Communist Party is the fundamental principle for the organization and members to carry out fundamental transformation, and it is also the fundamental guarantee for doing all work well; taking the socialist road is the political foundation and the only future of the Democratic League; political and ideological work is the soul and commander of all work; the correct organizational line is the guarantee for implementing the correct political line. When Shen Junru spoke about accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, he said that only by accepting the leadership of the Party and acting as the Party's assistant can the Democratic League adapt to the development of history and play a positive role in the revolution. Conversely, if it deviates from the leadership of the Party and acts on its own, it will lose its way and even become a reactionary force hindering social progress. Shen Junru especially pointed out that the Democratic League is a bourgeois political party, and the majority of its members have not completely abandoned their bourgeois stance. Therefore, the Democratic League must earnestly accept the leadership of the Party in all its work, and every member must resolutely fight against all thoughts and actions that deviate from the leadership of the Party and violate the Party's policies.

Shen Junru finally said that under the new historical situation, in order to implement the general line of socialist construction, the Democratic League must, under the leadership of the Party, undertake the following political tasks: actively participate in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of peace and the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu; actively participate in socialist construction and socialist revolution, especially the technological revolution and cultural revolution; and accelerate the socialist transformation of the organization and its members. When talking about the issue of transformation, Shen Junru said that our country is accelerating socialist construction, and the current political and organizational appearance of the Democratic League is not compatible with the current situation. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out the fundamental transformation of the organization, eliminate the remaining influence of the right-wing line, establish a correct political line and organizational line, establish a leading core that accepts the leadership of the Communist Party and resolutely takes the socialist road, and transform the Democratic League from a bourgeois political party into a political party that accepts the leadership of the Communist Party and serves socialism. The organizational transformation of the League and the individual transformation of its members are unified and inseparable. The individual transformation of the League members should first transform their political stance, and at the same time, earnestly criticize all forms of bourgeois individualism and bourgeois academic thought.

In the seventeen days before the opening of today's congress, the representatives attending the congress used the methods of big blooming, big contending, big character posters, and big debates, and unfolded criticism and self-criticism in the spirit of rectification, carried out study, and improved their ideological understanding. During the congress, the representatives will further展开 in-depth discussions on the work report.

### 民盟全国代表大会开幕  沈钧儒说要使大会成为民盟历史上的转折点

    民盟全国代表大会开幕
    沈钧儒说要使大会成为民盟历史上的转折点
    新华社28日讯　中国民主同盟第三次全国代表大会今天上午在北京正式开幕。民盟组织和成员如何在社会主义建设大跃进的新形势下迅速、长期地进行根本改造，是这次大会的中心议题。
    民盟主席沈钧儒在大会开幕时向二百八十多名代表致开幕词说，我们一定要开好这次大会，使它成为民盟历史上的一个转折点。
    沈钧儒接着代表民盟第二届中央委员会向大会作了工作报告。他在报告了目前国际、国内的形势后说，在中国共产党的领导下，运用组织和群众的力量，帮助资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子加速政治立场和思想的改造，使他们跟上形势，全心全意地为贯彻社会主义建设总路线、为加速建成社会主义服务，过好社会主义关，是民盟当前工作的方向和目标。
    沈钧儒在报告中回顾了九年来特别是社会主义改造高潮以后到反右派斗争和整风运动这一个时期内民盟工作的经验教训。他指出这些经验教训主要是：真正接受共产党的领导是组织和成员进行根本改造的根本原则，也是做好一切工作的根本保证；走社会主义道路是民盟的政治基础和唯一前途；政治思想工作是一切工作的灵魂和统帅；正确的组织路线是贯彻正确的政治路线的保证。沈钧儒在讲到接受中国共产党的领导时说，民盟只有接受党的领导，作党的助手，才能适应历史的发展，对革命起积极作用。反之，如果离开了党的领导，单独搞一套，它就会迷失方向，甚至成为阻碍社会前进的反动力量。沈钧儒特别指出，民盟是一个资产阶级性质的政党，盟员的多数还没有完全抛弃资产阶级立场。因此，民盟在一切工作中必须认真接受党的领导，每一个盟员都必须向一切脱离党的领导和违反党的政策的思想、行动进行坚决的斗争。
    沈钧儒最后说，在新的历史形势下，为了贯彻执行社会主义建设的总路线，民盟必须在党的领导下担负起下列的政治任务：积极参加反对帝国主义以及保卫和平和解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖的斗争；积极参加社会主义建设和社会主义革命、特别是技术革命和文化革命；加速进行组织和成员的社会主义改造。在谈到关于改造的问题的时候，沈钧儒说，我们国家正在加速进行社会主义建设，民盟目前的政治面貌和组织面貌与当前的形势是不相适应的，因此必须进行组织的根本改造，清除右派路线的残余影响，树立正确的政治路线和组织路线，建立接受共产党领导、坚决走社会主义道路的领导核心，把民盟从资产阶级的政党改造成为接受共产党领导的、为社会主义服务的政党。盟的组织改造和成员的个人改造是统一不可分的，盟员的个人改造，首先就要改造政治立场，同时也要认真地批判形形色色的资产阶级个人主义和资产阶级学术思想等。
    在今天大会开幕以前的十七天中，出席大会的代表们运用了大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的方式，以整风的精神展开了批评和自我批评，进行了学习，提高了思想认识。代表们在大会期间还将就工作报告进一步展开深入的讨论。
