    Panama Dockworkers Protest Discrimination by US Companies
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Four hundred dockworkers at the Balboa and Cristobal docks in the Panama Canal Zone refused to work beyond their scheduled hours in late October, protesting against the US companies in the Canal Zone classifying them as temporary workers. As temporary workers, they do not receive overtime pay for work outside working hours, on Sundays and holidays, and are deprived of paid holiday wages and pension rights. Half of Panama's population of nine hundred thousand relies on working in the US-controlled Canal Zone for their livelihood. Although the treaty signed in 1953 stipulates that the Canal Company should implement equal wages for American and Panamanian employees, American companies have consistently discriminated against Panamanians.

    巴拿马码头工人抗议美国公司歧视
    据新华社讯　巴拿马运河区的巴尔菩亚码头和克利斯托波尔码头的四百名码头工人在10月下旬拒绝在规定的工作时间以外做工，抗议运河区的美国公司把他们定为临时工，因为临时工虽然在工作以外的时间、星期天和假日工作，但得不到超时工资，同时假日工资照付和领取养老金的权利也被剥夺了。在巴拿马九十万人口中有一半人依靠在美国控制下的运河区工作来维持生活。尽管根据1953年所签定的条约，运河公司对美国和巴拿马的职工应该实行工资平等，但美国公司一直对巴拿马人采取歧视态度。
