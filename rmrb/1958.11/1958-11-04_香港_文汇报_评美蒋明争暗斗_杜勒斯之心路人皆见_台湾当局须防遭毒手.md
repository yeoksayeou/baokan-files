Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 3rd. Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" has published news and commentaries for several days, pointing out that the open and covert struggles between the United States and the Taiwan authorities are becoming increasingly fierce. The newspaper believes that this can also be seen from the statements of pro-Chiang newspapers in Hong Kong.

"Wen Wei Po" published a message on the 2nd saying that since the release of the Chiang-Dulles talks communiqué, people in the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and pro-Chiang people in Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas have been greatly frustrated, believing that this is a document of "humiliating the country and forfeiting sovereignty (referring to the Kuomintang)." Pro-Chiang newspapers in Hong Kong have heavily criticized the United States in recent days.

The message said that this clearly reflects that the US-Chiang contradictions have not weakened due to the talks, but have instead intensified and become more apparent than before the talks.

Prior to this, "Wen Wei Po" had analyzed the recent statements of pro-Chiang newspapers in Hong Kong, summarizing their views on US-Chiang relations as: First, pro-Chiang newspapers in Hong Kong all affirmed that "abandoning the use of force" was "due to Dulles' pressure" and would not be Chiang Kai-shek's "original intention." Second, it is believed that this is Taiwan losing its sovereignty, and the United States is locking up the military and civilians of Taiwan, large and small, in a "cage." Third, it is recognized that the United States wants to create "two Chinas," attempting to make the US "base defense line" in Taiwan "long-term and stable." Fourth, it has been felt that the United States may sell out the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities. "Wen Wei Po" pointed out that it is certainly not a bad thing that pro-Chiang newspapers in Hong Kong can have these understandings. The commentary pointed out that the Taiwan authorities may as well take the recent public opinion of pro-Chiang newspapers as one of the capitals for exerting counter-pressure on the United States.

"Wen Wei Po" published an observer's commentary on the 1st, saying that the result of the Chiang-Dulles talks was that the United States forced Chiang Kai-shek to accept "two Chinas," isolating Taiwan and forcing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to a dead end. This point has been seen by all pro-Chiang and supporters of Chiang newspapers in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

The commentary said that it seems that the remarks of pro-Chiang newspapers in Taiwan and Hong Kong are exactly what the Taiwan authorities are thinking. The indignation and fear in these newspapers are exactly the indignation and fear of the Taiwan authorities. The Taiwan authorities are the ones who suffer the most, so their indignation and fear should be even greater than that of the pro-Chiang newspapers.

After analyzing Dulles' three speeches on September 30, October 16, and October 28, the commentary pointed out that looking at these three speeches together, it can be completely seen that Dulles wants to isolate Taiwan, put Taiwan under trusteeship, and "kill Chiang Kai-shek's entire chess game." "Wen Wei Po" wrote that if the first step of the United States to isolate Taiwan is successful, the next step will be to put Taiwan under trusteeship. And the step of putting Taiwan under trusteeship is also the final step of kicking away the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Because the Chiang Kai-shek clique has no place in the second step of the United States.

"Wen Wei Po" advised the Taiwan authorities to beware of this danger, not to let the Americans take away all the power, be tightly bound by others, or be poisoned unexpectedly, which would be too unjust.

### 香港“文汇报”评美蒋明争暗斗  杜勒斯之心路人皆见  台湾当局须防遭毒手

    香港“文汇报”评美蒋明争暗斗
    杜勒斯之心路人皆见
    台湾当局须防遭毒手
    新华社香港3日电　香港“文汇报”连日发表消息和评论，指出美国和台湾当局之间的明争暗斗日益激烈。这家报纸认为，这从香港亲蒋报刊的言论中也可以看出来。
      “文汇报”在2日发表消息说，蒋杜会谈公报发表以来，台湾蒋介石集团人士和香港、澳门与海外的亲蒋人士都大为沮丧，认为这是一个“丧权辱国（指国民党）”的文件。香港亲蒋报纸连日来对美国大加抨击。
    消息说，这明显地反映出美蒋矛盾不但没有由于会谈而减弱，反而比会谈以前更加加剧，更加表面化了。
    在这以前，“文汇报”曾把最近时期香港亲蒋报纸的言论加以分析，综合它们对美蒋关系的看法是：第一是香港亲蒋报纸都肯定“放弃武力”是“出于杜勒斯的压力”，不会出于蒋介石的“本愿”。第二是认为这是台湾丧失主权，美国把台湾军民大小一体关进“牢笼”。第三是认识到美国要搞“两个中国”，企图让美国在台湾的“基地防线长治久安”。第四是已感觉到美国有出卖台湾国民党当局的可能。“文汇报”指出，香港亲蒋报纸能够有这些认识，当然不是坏事。评论指出，台湾当局未始不可以拿亲蒋报纸的最近舆论，为向美国施反压力的资本之一。
      “文汇报”在1日发表了一篇观察家的评论说，蒋杜会谈的结果是美国压迫蒋介石接受“两个中国”，是孤立台湾，逼蒋介石集团走上绝路。这一点、台湾、香港两地所有亲蒋拥蒋的报纸都看到了。
    评论说，看来，台湾、香港两地亲蒋报纸的言论，正是台湾当局心里的话。这些报纸上的愤懑和恐惧，正是台湾当局的愤懑和恐惧。台湾当局且是身受者，则其愤懑与恐惧，当较亲蒋报纸为尤甚。
    评论在分析了杜勒斯9月30日、10月16日和10月28日的三次谈话后指出，把这三篇谈话合起来看，就完全可以看出杜勒斯要孤立台湾，托管台湾而“将死蒋介石的全盘棋路”。“文汇报”写道，假如美国孤立台湾的第一步棋成功，接下去就是第二步托管台湾。而托管台湾这一步，同时就是最后踢开蒋介石集团的一步。因为美国的第二步已经没有蒋介石集团的地位了。
    “文汇报”劝告台湾当局提防这种危险，不要让美国人把权柄一一夺走了，被别人紧紧捆住了手脚，或者冷不防遭了毒手，这就太冤枉了。
