Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 9th: To adapt to the situation of the great leap forward in production and the needs of collectivized life after the people's communes, forty counties in Henan Province have merged and centralized their rural primary and secondary schools. The merged and centralized schools implement four collectivizations: collective accommodation, eating, studying, and labor. The people's communes cover all expenses for students' food, accommodation, tuition, and medical care, so students do not spend a single penny.

The merged schools generally have around one thousand students and include both primary and secondary sections. The people's communes provide strong support to the merged and centralized schools, not only equipping them with Party and Youth League cadres to strengthen Party leadership but also allocating doctors, medical staff, cooks, etc. They also provide nannies for primary school students. The people's commune in Shangqiu County transferred more than 800 cooks to schools throughout the county, vacated more than 1,000 rooms, and allocated more than 600 mu of vegetable gardens and a large amount of cooking utensils. Most schools in the Xinxiang Special Zone have doctors, medical staff, or clinics. Most lower-grade primary school students in Hua County, Anyang, and Yancheng counties have one or two nannies to take care of their eating and sleeping. Many people's communes have transferred industrial and agricultural technicians to schools to help them establish factories and open experimental fields. In these schools, students are organized to participate in labor according to their different ages. Students live a more comfortable and regulated life than at home. Parents are full of praise, saying that Chairman Mao has thought of everything for them.

The merger and centralization of primary and secondary schools not only allows parents to concentrate on socialist production labor and study but also has many advantages in school education. First, students' collective life, collective study, and collective labor facilitate the implementation of collectivist and communist education. In collective life, students can not only develop the ability to live independently, but also easily cultivate students' communist character of mutual assistance and love, as schools encourage older students to help younger students. After the merger, the number of teachers increases, and each school can establish several research groups according to class or course to strengthen collective research and gradually improve teaching quality. The greatest advantage is that the Party committee can provide concrete leadership to the school, strengthen the Party's power in the school, and facilitate the communist education of teachers and students. After the Mengmiao Township in Yancheng County merged fifteen schools into five, the five secretaries of the township Party committee each managed one school. Collective student accommodation can also completely popularize primary and secondary education, avoiding the phenomenon of student mobility caused by various objective reasons. It also completely solves the long-standing problem of students spending a lot of time commuting due to the scattered distribution of schools, and it can also avoid various accidents that occur to primary school students on the road.

Recently, the Henan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of heads of propaganda departments and heads of cultural and educational departments of various cities and regions, focusing on discussing this issue. The meeting instructed local Party committees to strengthen leadership over the merged schools, and each school should be equipped with a certain number of Party member cadres. The meeting also emphasized the importance of managing student life well, equipping schools with better cooks whenever possible; primary school classes below the second grade should have a certain number of nannies to take care of the elementary students' food, clothing, shelter, and transportation; schools with the necessary conditions should establish clinics or equip them with doctors and medical staff.

    河南四十个县农村中、小学合并集中
    学生全部免费在校食宿
    新华社郑州9日电　河南省有四十个县的农村中、小学校进行合并和集中，以适应人民公社化后生产更大跃进的形势和生活集体化的需要。合并和集中后的学校，实行四集体化，即集体住宿、吃饭、读书和劳动。人民公社对学生的吃、住、学费和医疗等实行包干，学生不花一文钱。
    合并后的学校，一般都在千人左右，一个学校中包括小学和中学两部分。人民公社对合并和集中后的学校，都给以大力支持，不仅给学校配备了党、团员骨干力量，加强党的领导，同时调配了医生、医务员和炊事员等，还给小学生配备保育员。商丘县的人民公社给全县学校调去八百多名炊事员，腾出了一千多间房子，拨给六百多亩菜园和大量的炊具。新乡专区的大部分学校有医生、医务员，或医务室。滑县、安阳、郾城三县的大部分小学低年级学生都有一名到两名保育员，照顾孩子们吃饭和睡觉。不少人民公社给学校调来了工农业技术人员，帮助学校建立工厂和开辟试验田。在这些学校里，学生们都按照不同的年龄，组织起来参加劳动。学生过着比在家更舒适、更有规律的生活。家长们个个称赞叫好，说毛主席什么都给他们想到了。
    中、小学校实行合并和集中，除了使家长们能够集中精力参加社会主义的生产劳动和学习外，在学校教育上的优越性也很多。首先，是学生集体生活、集体学习、集体劳动，便于对学生进行集体主义和共产主义教育，在集体化的生活中，不仅能养成学生独立生活的能力，而且由于学校鼓励大同学帮助小同学，又容易养成学生互助友爱的共产主义品格。并校后，教师增多，每所学校都能按照班级或课程成立若干研究小组，加强集体研究，逐步提高教学质量。最大的优越性是党委对学校能进行具体领导，加强学校中党的力量，便于对师生进行共产主义的教育。郾城县的孟庙乡由十五所学校合并成五所后，乡党委的五个书记，各管一所。学生集体住宿，还可以彻底普及中小学教育，避免学生因种种客观原因产生的流动现象；也彻底解决了过去长期存在的由于学校分散，学生往返占用大量时间的问题，还可以避免小学生在路上发生的各种事故。
    最近，中共河南省委召开的各地市委宣传部长、文教部长会议上，着重讨论了这个问题，会议指示各地党委组织要加强对合并后的学校的领导，各校要配备一定数量的党员骨干。会议还强调管好学生生活的重要意义，要尽可能给学校配备较好的炊事员；二年级以下的小学班，要有一定数量的保育员照顾小学生的衣食住行；有条件的学校，应建立医务所或配备医生、医务员。
