    Tens of Thousands of New Era "Clever Girls" Emerge
    Changzhi Prefecture's Technical Innovation Force Rapidly Grows
    (Reported by this newspaper) In the "Clever Girl" movement of "Learning from Clever Girls, Catching Up with Mi Shan Township, Everyone a Multi-Talent, Building a New Countryside" in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, over 170,000 "Clever Girls", "Clever Housewives," and "Female Soil Experts" have emerged this year.
    These young and middle-aged women, known as "ingenious, daring to think and act," have become an important force in technological innovation in industrial and agricultural production.
    Most of them are versatile "multi-talents," and some are skilled experts or "soil experts" who are proficient in a certain professional knowledge. In Qin County alone, there are 300 people skilled in sheep breeding and fruit tree cultivation, and 400 people are called water conservancy soil experts. In Licheng County, the eight clever girls led by Cheng Shuangchong of Chengjiashan can master the complete set of field labor techniques such as cultivating, sowing, and harvesting. This year, they used five acres of barren land as their cotton experimental field. Throughout the year, through deep plowing, heavy fertilization, and careful cultivation, weeding, and pruning, the cotton grew with thick stalks and large bolls, yielding 1,000 catties of seed cotton per mu. A fruit processing plant composed of eight village girls in Wuxiang County not only completed the task of processing 20,000 catties of fruit in two months but also used dried apricots, plums, and other materials to make delicious green plums, apricot jam, apricot cakes, fruit candies, and 35 other new products. Meng Jinnv and five other "clever girls" from Sitou Village, Ping顺县, with the help of agricultural cooperative technicians, reformed tools and worked hard for five days and nights, creating five new tools such as vegetable knives, deep plows, and earth carts. The earth cart alone can improve efficiency nearly ten times compared to carrying by people.
    The unfolding of the "Clever Girl" movement has inspired the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of rural women. The 560,000 young and middle-aged female laborers in the entire region have now become an important force on the industrial and agricultural production front. On the Tunjiang Reservoir construction site, where more than 20,000 people were working, the "Liu Hulan Commando Team" composed of five clever girls created the highest record on the entire construction site with an outstanding achievement of 19 cubic meters of earth transported per person per day and a carload of earth loaded in four seconds. As soon as the banner of this commando team was planted on the construction site, the competition of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced" between teams and groups was enthusiastically launched throughout the construction site.
    "Clever Girl" was originally the term used by members of the Mi Shan Township Agricultural Cooperative in Gaoping County, this prefecture, for Communist Party member Song Chou'er, Communist Youth League member Wang Leping, and Li Chunhua. Because these three girls, with an average age of just 21, dared to think and act, worked hard, and not only could sew, quilt, embroider, and cut paper, but also learned to plow the land with double-shared plows, could operate pot camel machines, diesel engines, and gas engines, could use drilling machines to drill wells, could graft trees, raise bees, and treat corn borers...
    After these three "multi-talented" clever girls were discovered by the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in January of this year, they called on young and middle-aged women throughout the prefecture to launch the "Clever Girl" movement of "Learning from Clever Girls, Catching Up with Mi Shan Township, Everyone a Multi-Talent, Building a New Countryside," and believed that carrying out this movement would greatly facilitate the widespread development of technological innovation in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and could also rapidly improve women's labor efficiency and production technology level. In order to quickly launch this movement, cadres from Mi Shan Township, Gaoping County, were specially dispatched to various counties to make a tour report, spreading the model deeds of "Clever Girls" who were both red and expert. During the "March 8th" International Women's Day this year, the Gaoping County Women's Federation also held an on-site meeting in Mi Shan Township, organizing women from ten nearby townships to visit the "Clever Girls'" enthusiasm for production and their zeal for science and technology. The county also mobilized women to participate in red and expert night schools, promoted the method of worshiping old farmers as teachers, signing contracts between teachers and apprentices, and on-site visits, so that they had the opportunity to systematically study politics, agricultural science knowledge, and agricultural technology. Now, 90% of the female labor force in the county has received technical education.
    In order to break the mysterious view of reforming tools, all localities have paid attention to discovering the example of newly grown "Clever Girls" to educate the broad masses of women. The Changzhi Prefectural Women's Federation assisted the Lu'an County Women's Federation in holding an on-site meeting in Dongyi Township, the hometown of tool reform expert Li Huaqin. Li Huaqin, this seventeen-year-old "Clever Girl," with the help of veteran technical farmers, reformed 22 kinds of tools in ten days. This fact liberated the minds of the attendees who were bound by conservatism. The more than 400 women in this township reformed another 44 kinds of tools in one month, totaling 948 pieces.

    新时代“巧姑娘”成千成万
    长治专区技术革新队伍迅速壮大
    本报讯　山西省长治专区在开展“学习巧姑娘，追赶米山乡，人人多面手，建设新农村”的“巧姑娘”运动中，今年已经涌现出“巧姑娘”、“巧媳妇”和“女土专家”十七万多人。
    这些被称为“心灵手巧，敢想敢干”的青壮年妇女，已经成为工农业生产技术革新的一支重要力量。
    他们大多数是多才多艺的“多面手”，也有些是精通某一项专业知识的能手或“土专家”。仅沁县一个县的绵羊配种、果树栽培能手有三百人，还有四百人被称为水利土专家。黎城县程家山以程双虫为首的八个巧姑娘，能掌握耕地、播种、收割等田间劳动的全套技术。她们今年把土质瘠薄的五亩地，当作自己的棉花试验田。全年经过深耕、多施肥、精心地中耕、锄草和整枝，结果棉花长得秆粗桃大，每亩索回籽棉一千斤。武乡县以八个村姑娘组成的一个水果加工厂，在两个月内除完成了加工水果两万斤的任务以外，还用杏干、李子等制作了味美可口的青梅、杏酱、杏糕、水果糖等三十五种新产品。平顺县寺头村孟金女等五个“巧姑娘”在农业社技术员帮助下改革工具，刻苦钻研五个昼夜，创造了切菜刀、深耕犁、土汽车等五种新工具，仅土汽车一项比人担即可提高效率将近十倍。
    “巧姑娘”运动的展开，鼓舞了广大农村妇女的劳动热情。全区五十六万青壮年妇女劳动力，现在已经成为工农业生产战线上的重要力量。在两万多人施工的屯绛水库工地上，由五个巧姑娘组成的“刘胡兰突击队”，以每人日运土十九立方和四秒钟装土一车的优异成绩，创造了全工地的最高纪录。这个突击队的旗帜在工地上一插，队与队，组与组之间的“学先进、赶先进、超先进”的竞赛，便在整个工地上热烈展开。
    “巧姑娘”，最初是这个专区高平县米山乡农业社的社员们对共产党员宋丑儿、共青团团员王乐平、李春花的称呼。因为这三个平均年龄刚二十一岁的姑娘，敢想敢干，刻苦钻研，不仅会缝纫、弹花、刺绣、剪花，还学会了用双铧犁犁地，会开锅驼机、柴油机和煤气机，会用钻机打井，会接树、养蜂，会治玉米钻心灭虫……。
    这三个“多面手”的巧姑娘，被中共长治地委在今年1月间发现后，便号召全专区青壮年妇女展开“学习巧姑娘、追赶米山乡，人人多面手，建设新农村”的“巧姑娘”运动，并且认为开展这个运动，将会大大便利于工农业生产大跃进中技术革新的普遍开展，还能够迅速地提高妇女的劳动效率和生产技术水平。为了迅速开展这个运动，专门抽派高平县米山乡的干部到各县作了巡回报告。传播了“巧姑娘”又红又专的模范事迹。高平县妇联会在今年三八节时，又在米山乡召开了现场会议，组织了附近十个乡的妇女参观了“巧姑娘”的生产干劲和对科学技术的钻劲。这个县还发动妇女参加红专夜校，推广了拜老农为师、师徒订合同的方法和现场参观的方法，使她们有系统学习政治、学习农业科学知识和农业技术的机会。现在，全县已有90％的妇女劳动力受到技术教育。
    为了打破对改革工具的神秘观点，各地都注意发现以新成长的“巧姑娘”的榜样教育广大妇女。长治专区妇联会协助潞安县妇联会在工具改革能手李花琴的家乡东邑乡召开现场会议。李花琴这位十七岁的“巧姑娘”得到技术老农的帮助，十天内改革工具二十二种，这个事实解放了到会人受保守主义束缚的思想。这个乡的四百多妇女，在一个月内便又改革工具四十四种，共有九百四十八件。
