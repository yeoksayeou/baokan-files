Winter sowing of spring crops is a valuable experience that our ancestors accumulated over a long period of struggle against natural disasters. Now, not only are many places within the customs doing this, but various places in our province also have successful experiences. For example, this year, the winter-sown wheat in Fulongquan Township, Nong'an County, yielded 31% more than the spring-sown wheat; the winter-sown millet in Baishan Township, Lishu County, yielded 25% more than the spring-sown millet; and the winter-sown sunflowers in Hongguang People's Commune, Changling County, yielded 128% more than the spring-sown sunflowers. According to the production practice of various places, this advanced agricultural technology measure has many advantages:

  (1) It can withstand drought. The winter-sown wheat in the former Qiancheng Agricultural Cooperative in Nong'an County, even after more than forty days without rain, still had green stems and leaves and grew very well. (2) It can mature early. The winter-sown sunflowers in Hongguang People's Commune, Changling County, matured more than twenty days earlier than the spring-sown ones. (3) It has strong disaster resistance. In the same plot of land and with the same variety of wheat, the spring-sown wheat was infected with severe rust disease, while the winter-sown wheat was not infected at all. (4) All winter-sown wheat, millet or sunflowers have thick and strong stalks and do not lodge.

  (5) Because winter-sown crops are planted early, emerge early, and harvested early, it is convenient to arrange production during spring plowing. (6) The yield is high and the quality is good. Under the same conditions, winter-sown crops not only have higher yields, but also have fuller grains. The proportion of shriveled grains in winter-sown sunflowers is only 4%, while it is more than 30% in spring-sown sunflowers.

The following are several technical measures for winter-sown crops:

  (1) Deep plowing and application of more manure. The land for winter-sown crops must be deeply plowed first. Only when seeds are sown on loose soil is it conducive to seed germination and emergence in the coming spring.

  (2) Careful selection of good seeds and increased seed quantity. When spring crops are winter-sown, due to changes in external environmental conditions, some seeds with weak vitality will inevitably not germinate. Therefore, the issue of seed selection becomes even more important. Various localities should pay attention to selecting high-yielding varieties suitable for local conditions. Seeds should be carefully selected to ensure seed purity, and mature, full seeds with strong vitality should be selected for sowing. In order to ensure full stands, the sowing amount should be increased by 30% to 50% compared to spring sowing under dense planting conditions.

  (3) Correctly grasp the sowing time and adopt advanced sowing methods. The success or failure of winter-sown crops is closely related to the sowing time. If sowing is too early, the soil temperature is high, and the seeds are easily germinated and emerge, making it impossible to overwinter. If sowing is too late, the land freezes, causing difficulties in sowing and uneven sowing depths, as well as rough quality phenomena such as incomplete soil covering. Therefore, the best sowing time is when the ground freezes quickly after sowing, ensuring that the seeds do not germinate during overwintering, so that they can overwinter relatively safely.

 Before sowing, the land must be harrowed and leveled so that the sowing depth is consistent and the soil covering is uniform. The sowing depth should generally be about one to one and a half inches. Advanced experience in dense planting should be adopted in the sowing method.

  (4) Strengthen management to ensure full and strong seedlings. In addition to timely management during the growth process, winter-sown crops should also pay special attention to insulation and moisture conservation management, as with spring-sown crops. When sowing, the seeds should be in close contact with the soil to prevent the soil from subsiding next spring, and it can also reduce wind erosion of the soil. In early spring next year, because winter-sown crops germinate early, early spring repeated rolling should be carried out to prevent loosening and wind erosion. After rolling, the surface soil should be appropriately harrowed to loosen it, so as to increase the soil temperature and maintain soil moisture. Wheat and millet should be combined with harrowing to apply a layer of manure as topdressing to supply the seedlings' needs. The sunflowers and millet after emergence should be appropriately earthed up to prevent frost damage. In areas with severe spring drought, spring irrigation should also be carried out to ensure full and strong seedlings.

    怎样冬播向日葵、春小麦和谷子？
    春作物冬播，是我们祖先长期向自然灾害作斗争的宝贵经验。现在不仅关内许多地方是这样作的，我省各地也有成功的经验。如今年农安县伏龙泉乡冬播的小麦，比春播的增产31％；梨树县白山乡冬播的谷子，比春播的增产25％；长岭县红光人民公社冬播的向日葵，比春播的增产128％。根据各地生产实践的证明，这项先进农业技术措施具有很多优点：
  （1）能耐干旱。农安县原前程农业合作社冬播的小麦，虽经四十多天没下雨，仍然秆青叶绿，长的很好；（2）能早熟。长岭县红光人民公社冬播的向日葵，比春播提早成熟二十多天；（3）抗灾力强。在同一块地、又是同样品种的小麦，春播的感染了严重锈病，而冬播的却丝毫没有感染；（4）凡是冬播的小麦、谷子或向日葵，都秸棵粗壮、不倒伏；
  （5）由于冬播作物种的早，出苗早、收获早，在春耕的时候，便于安排生产；（6）产量高质量好。在同样条件下，凡是冬播的作物不仅产量高，籽粒也饱满。冬播向日葵秕粒仅占4％，而春播的却多到30％多。
    冬播作物的几项技术措施：
      （一）深耕土地，多施粪肥。要求冬播作物的土地要先做到深翻，只有播种在松软土地上才有利于来春种子萌芽出土。
      （二）精选良种，增加种子量。春性作物实行冬播，由于外界环境条件的改变，必然有一部分生活力弱的种子不发芽，因此选种的问题就显得更加重要。各地应注意选择适合当地风土条件的高产品种，种子要做到精选，达到种子纯净，选择成熟饱满、生活力旺盛的作种。为了保证全苗，播种量应在密植的条件下比春播增加三到五成。
      （三）正确掌握播种时期，采用先进播种方法。冬播作物成功与否和播种时期有很大关系。播种过早地温较高，种子容易萌发出土，不能越冬；播种过晚，土地冻结，造成播种困难和播种深浅不一，复土不严等质量粗糙现象。因此，最好的播种时期是在播种后大地很快封冻的时候，保证种子在越冬期间不发芽，这样才能较安全的越冬。
    在播种前必须将土地耙碎整平，以便播种深浅一致、复土均匀，播种深度一般应在一寸——一寸五左右为宜。在播种方法上应采用密植的先进经验。
      （四）加强管理，保证苗全苗壮。冬播作物除与春播一样在生育过程中及时管理外，还应该特别注意保温、保墒的管理。播种时要使种子与土壤密接，防止明春土壤下陷，而且还可以减少风剥土壤。明年早春由于冬播作物发芽早，应施行早春重复镇压，防止起渲跑风。镇压后适当耙地，疏松表土，以提高地温，保持土壤水分。小麦、谷子应该结合耙地扬施一层粪肥，以供苗期利用。出苗后的向日葵、谷子应适当培土，防止遭受霜害。春旱严重地区还应该进行春灌，以保证苗全苗壮。
