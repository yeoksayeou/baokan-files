    A stern warning to the Chiang troops,
    The Minister of National Defense issued a proclamation,
    Listen carefully, remnant Chiang troops,
    American masters are unreliable,
    The opportunity to return to the motherland has arrived.
    We are all Chinese,
    What good is it to fight each other,
    Unite as one to resist foreign enemies,
    And jointly expel the American devils.
    (Wu Yuesheng, soldier on the Fujian Front)

    正告蒋军
    国防部长发文告，
    残余蒋军细听好，
    美国主子不可靠，
    回到祖国机会到。
    我们都是中国人，
    自己相打有啥好，
    团结一致齐对外，
    共同驱逐美国佬。
    （福建前线战士　吴越生）
