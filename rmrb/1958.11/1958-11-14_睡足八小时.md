Editor's Note:

    The Shanghai Municipal Party organization and the leading departments at all levels in Anhui Province have taken various measures to ensure that the labor army on all fronts sleeps well, eats well, and rests well. This is a major event, especially getting eight hours of sleep, which is of even greater significance.

    Since the Great Leap Forward, many workers have often worked selflessly day and night, regardless of time or pay. When others advise them to take a break, they say, there is so much work to do that we cannot finish it even if we work continuously without eating or sleeping, so where is the time to rest?

    It should be said that this kind of labor enthusiasm is valuable. With the hard work and skillful work of millions of people, our country's economic front has seen such a vigorous and unprecedented glorious achievement this year. However, it must also be seen that no matter how strong a person's body is, how abundant their energy is, and how advanced their thinking is, if they continue to work continuously and intensively without limit and do not get enough sleep, their work and production will be affected.

    In order to work well, one must rest well. Only by resting well can one work even better.

    睡足八小时
    上海市党组织和安徽省各级领导部门采取各种措施，保证各条战线上的劳动大军睡好、吃好、休息好，这是一件大事，特别是睡足八小时，它的意义更大。
    大跃进以来，许多职工经常不计时间，不计报酬，夜以继日地忘我的劳动。别人劝他们休息一下，他们却说，工作这么多，不吃不眠连续苦战都干不完，哪有时间休息？
    应当说这种劳动热情是可贵的。有了千百万人的辛勤劳动，苦干巧干，今年我国经济战线上才出现了这种蓬蓬勃勃空前未有的辉煌成就。但是，也必须看到，一个人，身体再健壮，精力再充沛，思想再先进，如果无限度地连续紧张劳动下去，得不到充足的睡眠，工作和生产也就受到影响。
    为了劳动好，必须休息好，只有休息好，劳动得才会更好。
