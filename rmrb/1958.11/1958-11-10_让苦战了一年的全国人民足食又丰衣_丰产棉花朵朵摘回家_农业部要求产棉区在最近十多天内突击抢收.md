Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture made a statement to our agency reporter on the issue of cotton picking. He said that quickly and intensively rushing to harvest cotton, ensuring that none is lost, and bringing every boll home is a very urgent task for cotton-producing areas at present.

The person in charge said that this year the country's cotton has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. In order to strive to bring the bumper harvest into our hands, various regions are rushing to harvest. Up to now, the national cotton harvest has reached about 70% of the estimated output. However, because the output has increased by more than double compared to last year, harvesting is labor-intensive; and because industrial and agricultural production are leaping forward simultaneously, the arrangement and use of labor in many regions is not good enough, the progress of cotton picking this year is much slower than in previous years. The progress of cotton picking also varies from place to place. Some faster regions have harvested more than 80%, while slower regions have only harvested half, and some major cotton-producing areas even have some cotton fields that have only been picked once or twice. Due to the lack of timely harvesting, some areas have experienced considerable cotton boll falling after being exposed to wind and rain. This will not only result in some loss of yield but also reduce the quality of the cotton. In Hongqi People's Commune, Huaiyin County, Jiangsu Province, 10% of the cotton turned yellow and lost its luster due to rain.

The person in charge pointed out that, according to the above situation, quickly and intensively rushing to harvest cotton is a very urgent task for cotton-producing areas. It should be recognized that bringing all the bumper cotton harvest back not only has significant economic significance but also has significant political significance. Cotton, like all crops, will further encourage the broad masses of people to strive for a greater leap forward next year and accelerate socialist construction if all of them achieve bumper harvests.

The person in charge said that in order to launch a decisive battle to rush to harvest cotton in the next ten days or so, and achieve that every boll is brought home, according to the experience of advanced areas, it is first necessary to uniformly arrange labor, organize professional teams, and rush to harvest. Shulu County, Hebei Province, did this, and the progress of cotton picking was greatly accelerated. The county formed the young and middle-aged labor force into a steel production and deep plowing land army, and the old, weak, and semi-labor force into an autumn harvest army, of which nearly 100,000 people were specifically designated to pick cotton. In this way, not only was no production delayed, but the progress of cotton picking was also accelerated, and the average daily picking volume reached 6 million jin. This approach can be considered for promotion in various regions. Secondly, it is necessary to take all measures to tap the potential of labor in every corner; the labor force excavated from grassroots commercial departments, schools, towns, and agencies, etc., should be combined with the original rural cotton harvesting labor force to form a large corps for a concentrated attack. This method of mobilizing all possible forces to rush to pick can be carried out continuously for a few days, or it can be carried out every few days. In short, it is to bring back the cotton that has opened until it is all harvested. In order to motivate people to rush to pick, competitions should be organized, and communes and teams should be encouraged to compete to launch picking "satellites." This method of rushing to harvest should be widely adopted immediately in areas where cotton bolls have opened but have not been harvested in time. Thirdly, it is necessary to give full play to the superiority of the people's commune, organize communist large-scale cooperation, and mobilize mutual support between communes for rush harvesting. In short, all measures must be taken to bring the cotton harvest back; during the rush harvest, attention must also be paid to the quality of picking, striving not to lose a single boll and to pick every boll clean.

The person in charge finally said that rushing to harvest cotton is not only related to this year's bumper cotton harvest but also directly affects next year's cotton output. November 8th is already the Beginning of Winter, and November 23rd will be Minor Snow. Northern agricultural proverbs say, "Minor Snow freezes the ground, Major Snow seals the river," and freezing is about to come. If the cotton cannot be harvested as soon as possible, the deep plowing work of the cotton fields will inevitably be affected. If the cotton fields cannot be deeply plowed, it will also affect next year's cotton leap forward production targets. For this reason, it is necessary to intensify the rush harvest, and after the rush harvest, the stalks must be pulled out in time, and the cotton fields must be deeply plowed in a concentrated way; in combination with deep plowing, sufficient base fertilizer must also be applied; cotton fields with water conservancy conditions should be generally irrigated in winter; and various measures must be taken to eliminate the overwintering pests and diseases. This winter, conscientiously doing a good job in deeply plowing cotton fields, applying sufficient base fertilizer in layers, and generally irrigating in winter is a powerful guarantee for a greater cotton harvest next year.

### 让苦战了一年的全国人民足食又丰衣  丰产棉花朵朵摘回家  农业部要求产棉区在最近十多天内突击抢收

    让苦战了一年的全国人民足食又丰衣
    丰产棉花朵朵摘回家
    农业部要求产棉区在最近十多天内突击抢收
    新华社9日讯　农业部负责人就棉花采摘问题向本社记者发表了谈话。他说，赶快突击抢收棉花，保证不丢，朵朵归家，是产棉区当前一项十分紧急的任务。
    负责人说，今年全国棉花获得了空前大丰收。为了力争丰收到手，各地正在抢收。到目前止，全国收摘的棉花已达预计产量70％左右。但是，由于产量比去年增加一倍以上，收摘费工；由于工农业生产齐头跃进，不少地区对劳力的安排使用还不够好，今年棉花采摘进度比往年慢了很多。各地的棉花采摘进度也不平衡，快的地区已收80％以上，慢的地区才收了一半，有些主要产棉区甚至还有部分棉田仅采摘一两遍。由于采摘不够及时，部分地区棉花开絮后受到风吹雨打，棉絮落地现象相当严重。这样，不仅产量要受到一些损失，而且棉花质量也要降低。江苏省淮阴县红旗人民公社有10％的棉花就因雨淋发黄，失去了光泽。
    负责人指出，根据上述情况，赶快突击抢收棉花，是产棉区一项十分紧急的任务。应该认识到，把丰收的棉花全部收回，不仅有重大的经济意义，还有重大的政治意义。棉花和所有农作物一样，全部做到丰产丰收，就将进一步鼓舞广大人民群众力争明年实现更大跃进的干劲和信心，从而加速社会主义建设。
    负责人说，为了在最近十多天内展开一个抢收棉花的决战，做到朵朵归家，根据先进地区的经验，首先必须统一安排劳力，组织专业队，突击抢收。河北省束鹿县这样做了，棉花采摘进度就大大加快。这个县把青壮年劳力组成钢铁生产和深翻土地大军，把老弱和半劳力等组成秋收大军，其中又确定近十万人专门摘棉，这样，不仅各项生产都没耽误，棉花采摘进度也已加快，平均每天采摘量达到了六百万斤。这种做法，各地都可考虑推行。其次，要采取一切办法从各个角落挖掘劳力潜力；把从基层商业部门、学校、城镇和机关等挖出的劳力，和农村原有收棉劳力一道，组成大兵团，进行突击。这种动员一切可能动员的力量突击采摘的办法，可以连续搞几天，也可以隔几天搞一次，总之，是把开絮的棉花突击收回为止。为了鼓动人们突击采摘的干劲，应当组织竞赛，发动社与社、队与队间争放采摘“卫星”。这种突击抢收的作法，在棉絮已开又未及时采摘的地区，应该马上广泛采用。再次，要充分发挥人民公社的优越性，组织共产主义大协作，发动社与社间互相支援，进行抢收。总之，要采取一切办法，把棉花抢收回来；在抢收中，还必须注意收摘质量，力争不丢一朵，朵朵摘净。
    负责人最后说，突击抢收棉花，不仅关系到今年的棉花丰产丰收，还直接影响到明年的棉花产量。11月8日已经立冬，23日就是小雪，北方农谚说“小雪冻地，大雪封河”，冰冻就要来临。现在不能及早把棉花收完，棉田的深翻工作势必受到影响，棉田不能深翻，也就影响到明年的棉花跃进产量指标。为此，必须加紧抢收，抢收以后，就要及时拔秸，突击深翻棉田；结合深翻还要施足底肥；有水利条件的棉田，应该普遍进行冬灌；并且要采取各种措施，消灭潜藏越冬的害虫和病菌。今冬切实做好深翻棉田分层施足底肥，普遍冬灌，是明年棉花获得更大丰收的有力保证。（附图片）
