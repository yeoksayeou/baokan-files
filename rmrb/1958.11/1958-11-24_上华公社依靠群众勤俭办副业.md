Shanghua Commune Relies on the Masses to Diligently and Frugally Run Sideline Production
		Qiu Wenhua Zhao Tangnai Zhou Fangzheng
    In order to increase income, accumulate funds, and expand industrial and agricultural reproduction, the Shanghua People's Commune in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, while striving for a double harvest of steel and grain, has unified the allocation of forces and developed sideline production. The sideline production team has expanded from the original 207 people to more than 1,000 people. Now the commune can produce bricks, tiles, earth cement, lime, and straw paper, and raise pigs, sheep, dairy cows, rabbits, bees, and silkworms. It also uses chaff and corn stalks to make wine. The development of sideline production has greatly increased the commune's income. In October alone, sideline production earned 120,000 yuan, an increase of 8.3 times compared to before the establishment of the commune, which strongly supported the commune's industrial and agricultural production and increased the income of commune members. In October, the commune vigorously engaged in steel production, and the construction of furnaces required funds, so more than 20,000 yuan was drawn from sideline income to support industrial production in a timely manner. At the beginning of winter planting, the whole commune was short of more than 500,000 jin of seeds, and 30,000 yuan was taken from sideline income to buy seeds, so that more than 8,000 mu of wheat were sown on time. More than 50,000 yuan was also taken from sideline income to pay wages once.

    Accurate Accounting and Unified Understanding

    When Shanghua Commune started to focus on sideline production, it encountered some ideological resistance. Cadres and the masses generally believed that it was good to engage in sideline production, but there was no money or labor. Some said: Engaging in sideline production requires a large number of laborers and costs money, so there's no point; others said: Industry needs generals, agriculture needs soldiers, where is the strength to engage in sideline production? In response to these ideas, the commune party committee first conducted communist education, talking about the bright future of the people's commune and the policy of combining industry and agriculture. Then, it seized several issues to lead the commune members in discussion and made detailed calculations.

    Is there any point in sideline production? In the discussion, detailed accounts were calculated: The commune has more than 120 kinds of sideline production, of which only a few require large costs, and most do not require much money. For example, the dairy farm only needs four and a half laborers and can milk more than 100 jin a day, earning 36 yuan. All kinds of sideline production in the whole commune require 1,500 full laborers and 48,000 yuan in costs, but can earn 150,000 to 200,000 yuan per month (net income of more than 110,000 yuan). After accounting, everyone saw that sideline production had great potential.

    Is there enough labor? The whole commune has more than 18,000 full and semi-laborers. After transferring more than 6,000 to the steel front, there are still more than 12,000. With the establishment of public canteens and nurseries and kindergartens, more than 9,100 women have been liberated from housework. In addition to doing a good job in agricultural production, some can be drawn to engage in sideline production.

    Is it okay not to engage in sideline production? In the discussion, everyone realized that the commune needs a lot of funds to develop industry and agriculture; especially after the implementation of grain supply and basic wage system, the whole commune has to pay more than 94,000 yuan for wages once a month. Without sideline production, there would not be so much income, nor could the living standards of commune members be gradually improved. Some commune members also said: "National construction not only needs grain, but also a large number of various materials. To support construction, how can there be no reason not to engage in sideline production?"

    After the debate, ideas were unified, and solutions were found. Commune members posted more than 10,000 big-character posters on how to do a good job in sideline production.

    Strengthen Leadership and Rely on the Masses

    To do a good job in sideline production, there must be sound organizational leadership. The Shanghua Commune first established a sideline production office, drawing three members from the party committee to specifically lead sideline production, and also drawing 18 deputy brigade leaders and three branch secretaries from the 18 production brigades in the whole commune to manage sideline production. Each sideline unit has separately organized a management committee.

    In the process of sideline production, the commune party committee has always actively relied on the masses and adhered to the principle of running sideline production diligently and frugally. When expanding the Yanxi brick and tile factory, there was a shortage of ten large buffaloes, 300 dan of rice straw, and more than 1,500 pieces of wood. What to do? The problem was given to the commune members for discussion. The commune members said: These things do not need to be bought, everyone can invest. In less than two days, all the buffaloes, rice straw, and wood were equipped. Guo Lanhua, a woman in her sixties from the Huliandui brigade, heard that the brick and tile factory was short of wood, and took out the more than 20 pieces of fir wood boards that were left for making coffins as an investment. The original expansion plan for this factory was to cost more than 2,000 yuan, but with the support of the masses, it only cost three yuan.

    Fixed Personnel and Improved Technology

    According to the experience of Shanghua Commune, fixed personnel and specialized production are important keys to ensuring the normal development of sideline production. The commune has made overall arrangements based on the needs of labor on the steel, agriculture, and sideline fronts, and has drawn more than 1,000 laborers to engage in sideline production on a fixed basis, and has established specialized labor organizations. For example, sideline industries such as burning lime, burning bricks and tiles, and raising pigs are all responsible by full-time personnel throughout the year; seasonal sideline industries such as oil pressing and silkworm raising generally have fixed production personnel, but return to the agricultural front after the production season. At the same time, agriculture and sideline industries also frequently carry out mutual support and mutual cooperation.

    In order to promote advanced experience and continuously improve the quality of sideline products, the commune also organized mutual competition and mutual teaching and learning movements between factories and farms. The Lianfeng Paper Mill (old factory) has high technology and good product quality, and each dan of straw paper can be sold for twelve yuan; while the straw paper produced by the Yangqingqiao Paper Mill (new factory) can only be sold for eight yuan per dan. The commune transferred technicians from the Lianfeng old factory to the new factory to take apprentices. Through competition and assistance, the quality of sideline products has been continuously improved, a large number of new technical forces have been cultivated, and a mass technical innovation movement has also been launched.

    上华公社依靠群众勤俭办副业
    丘文化　赵堂奶　周芳正
    浙江兰溪县上华人民公社为了增加收入、积累资金、扩大工农业再生产，在争取钢铁、粮食双丰收的同时，统一调配力量，发展了副业生产。副业队伍由原来的二百零七人扩大到一千多人，现在社里能生产砖、瓦、土水泥、石灰、草纸，养了猪、羊、奶牛、兔子、蜜蜂和蚕，还利用糠和玉米秆制酒。副业生产的发展，使公社收入大大增加，仅10月份副业就收入十二万元，比建公社前增加了八点三倍，有力地支援了社里的工农业生产，增加了社员收入。10月份社里大搞钢铁生产，建炉需要资金，就从副业收入中抽出二万多元，及时支援了工业生产。冬种开始，全社缺五十多万斤种籽，也在副业收入中拿出三万元买种籽，使八千多亩小麦按时播种。还从副业收入中拿出五万多元，发了一次工资。
    算细账、统一认识
    上华公社在开始抓副业生产的时候，碰到了一些思想抵触。干部和群众普遍认为搞副业好是好，就是没钱没劳力。有的说：搞副业既要用大批劳力，又要花成本，没搞头；有的说：工业上要将，农业上要兵，哪有力量搞副业？公社党委针对这些思想，首先进行共产主义教育，大讲人民公社的美好前途和工农业并举方针，接着抓住几个问题领导社员进行讨论，并且算了细账。
    副业生产有没有搞头？在讨论中算了细账：公社副业门路有一百二十多种，其中要花较大成本的只是少数，多数不用花什么钱。例如牛奶场，只需要四个半劳力，每天可挤奶一百多斤，能收入三十六元。全社各种副业加起来，需要一千五百个整劳力、四万八千元成本，而每月可收入十五至二十万元（净收入十一万元以上）。经过算账，大家看到副业生产大有可为。
    劳力够不够？全社一万八千多个整半劳动力，抽调六千多个到钢铁战线上，还有一万二千多。办起公共食堂和托儿组、幼儿园，九千一百多个妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，除搞好农业生产以外，是可以抽一部分来搞副业的。
    不搞副业行不行？在讨论中，大家认识到：公社要发展工农业都需要大量的资金；特别是实行口粮供给和基本工资制以后，全社每月发一次工资就得九万四千多元。不搞副业就没有这么多的收入，也不能逐步提高社员的生活水平，有的社员还说：“国家建设不光需要粮食，还需要大批的各种物资，要支援建设，哪有不搞副业之理？”
    经过辩论，统一了思想，也想出了办法，社员们对怎样搞好副业生产贴了一万多张大字报。
    加强领导依靠群众
    要把副业生产搞好，必须要有健全的组织领导。上华公社首先成立了副业生产办公室，从党委会中抽出三个委员专门领导副业生产，又在全社十八个生产大队中抽出十八个副大队长、三个分支书记管副业生产。每个副业单位，都分别组织了管理委员会。
    在副业生产的过程中，社党委始终积极依靠群众，坚持勤俭办副业的方针。在扩建烟溪砖瓦厂的时候，缺少十只大水牛、三百担稻草、一千五百多根木料。怎么办？把问题交给社员讨论。社员说：这些东西都不用买，大家投资就行。不到两天时间，水牛、稻草和木料全都配齐了。互联大队六十多岁的郭兰花听说砖瓦厂缺少木料，把留下准备做棺材的二十多块杉木板也拿出来作投资。这个厂原来的扩建计划要花二千多元，在群众的支持下，只花了三元钱。
    固定人员提高技术
    根据上华公社的经验，人员固定、生产专业化，是保证副业生产正常发展的重要关键。社内根据钢铁、农业、副业各个战线需要劳力的情况作了全面安排，抽出一千多个劳力固定搞副业，并建立专业化劳动组织。如烧石灰、烧砖瓦、养猪等副业，都有专人常年负责；榨油、养蚕等季节性的副业，生产人员一般固定，但生产季节过了就回农业战线。同时农、副业之间也经常开展相互支援、相互协作。
    为了推广先进经验，不断提高副业产品的质量，公社还组织厂与厂、场与场之间的相互竞赛和互教互学运动。联丰造纸厂（老厂）的技术高，产品质量好，每担草纸能卖十二元；而杨青桥纸厂（新厂）出的草纸每担只能卖八元。公社就从联丰老厂抽调技术人员到新厂去带徒弟。通过竞赛和帮助，副业产品质量不断提高，培养了大批新的技术力量，群众性的技术革新运动也开展起来了。
