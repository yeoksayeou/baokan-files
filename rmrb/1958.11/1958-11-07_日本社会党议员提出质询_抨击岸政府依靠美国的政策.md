Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 6th: Japanese Socialist Party Diet member Mitsugi Hanyu, speaking at a meeting of the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Councillors on the 4th, again accused the Nobusuke Kishi government of attempting to undermine democracy through actions such as forcibly implementing the "work performance rating" system, revising the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law," revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and amending the Constitution.

	In his questioning, Hanyu pointed out that the vast majority of Japanese citizens oppose the revision of the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law." The Nobusuke Kishi government is insisting on making revisions without listening to the opinions of the opposition parties and the general public, which is to turn the Diet into a tool for forcibly passing bills with a majority vote.

	Hanyu expressed concern that the Nobusuke Kishi government's attempts to amend the Constitution and rely on the military force of the United States to "guarantee" Japan's security would not benefit Japan. He said that the objective conditions for Japan to be suddenly attacked in the future are very small, but there is a possibility that U.S. troops might use bases in Japan under the pretext of "maintaining" peace and security in the Far East. Therefore, Hanyu believes that Japan's participation in the Japan-U.S. "joint defense system" will increase the risk of Japan being dragged into war.

	Mitsugi Hanyu, Masaru Sone, Soji Okada, Tadataka Sata, and other Socialist Party Diet members questioned the Nobusuke Kishi government on whether it had agreed to the U.S. demands that Japan dispatch troops abroad, extend the scope of the treaty to Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, and expand it to the Western Pacific in the Japan-U.S. talks on revising the "Security Treaty." In his response, Nobusuke Kishi tried his best to conceal the truth. He denied that the scope of the treaty would be extended to the Western Pacific, but he believed that Japan "originally had a defense obligation" to Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands. He also reiterated that Japan would implement "joint defense" with the United States.

	Nobusuke Kishi refused to clearly state the obligations that Japan would assume under the new military treaty, only saying that it would provide military bases to the United States. However, he also stated that he did not intend to explicitly stipulate in the treaty the issues that the Japanese people unanimously demand, such as not dispatching troops abroad and prohibiting the import of nuclear weapons.

	Regarding the issue of prior consultation with Japan when U.S. forces take military action using Japanese bases, Socialist Party Diet members asked Nobusuke Kishi to explain the content of the consultation. Tadataka Sata also pointed out that U.S. military authorities have repeatedly stated that they cannot agree to a prior consultation method that "would prevent U.S. forces from being dispatched in an emergency." Nobusuke Kishi admitted that his statement about consultations between the U.S. military stationed in Japan and Japan before taking military action contained his "subjective wishes." He believes that the United States will respect Japan's opinions.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 5th, TASS: According to broadcasts from Japanese radio stations, former Japanese Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi held a press conference on the 5th, condemning the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party for forcibly extending the session of the extraordinary Diet, attempting to use it to pass the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law Amendment Bill." Tanzan Ishibashi said that this practice has nothing in common with the normal functioning of the Diet.

	Tanzan Ishibashi said that the Nobusuke Kishi government's actions were "unjust" and that it had not consulted with the Socialist Party before submitting this amendment.

    日本社会党议员提出质询
    抨击岸政府依靠美国的政策
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本社会党议员羽生三七4日在日本国会参议院预算委员会会议上再次指责岸信介政府企图通过强制实行“勤务评定”制度、修改“警察官职务执行法”、修改日美“安全条约”和修改宪法等行动来破坏民主。
    羽生在质询中指出，日本绝大多数国民都反对修改“警察官职务执行法”，岸信介政府不听在野党和国民大众的意见硬要进行修改，这是要把国会变成以多数强行通过法案的工具。
    羽生担心岸信介政府企图修改宪法和依靠美国的武力来“保障”日本的安全的做法对日本没有好处。他说，日本将来突然遭到进攻的客观条件是很少的，倒是有美军假借“保持”远东和平和安全的名义，从日本的基地出动的可能性。因此，羽生认为，日本参加日美“共同防御体系”，将会增大日本被卷入战争的危险性。
    羽生三七、曾祢益、冈田宗司、佐多忠隆等社会党议员对岸信介政府在日美关于修改“安全条约”的会谈中，是否同意美方要求日本派兵出国、要求把条约适用范围扩大到冲绳和小笠原群岛，扩大到西太平洋等问题进行了质询。岸信介在答辩中竭力掩饰，他否认要把条约适用范围扩大到西太平洋，但是他认为日本对冲绳和小笠原群岛“本来就有防卫的义务”。他并且重申日本要和美国实行“联防”。
    岸信介不肯明白说出日本根据新的军事条约所要承担的义务，只说要向美国提供军事基地。但是，他又表示，他不打算把日本人民所一致要求的不派兵出国和禁止运进核武器等问题在条约里面作明文规定。
    关于美军利用日本基地采取军事行动时在事前和日本协商的问题，社会党议员们要求岸信介说明协商的内容。佐多忠隆还指出，美军当局已经一再表示不能同意“在发生紧急情况的时候将会使美军不能出动”的事前协商的办法。岸信介承认他所说的关于驻日美军在采取军事行动以前将和日本协商的讲法包含有他的“主观愿望”。他认为美国会尊重日本方面的意见。
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社东京5日讯：据日本电台广播，日本前首相石桥湛山5日举行了记者招待会，谴责岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党强行延长国会临时会议会期，企图借以通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”。石桥湛山说，这种做法同国会正常地进行工作没有丝毫共同点。
    石桥湛山说，岸信介政府的行为是“不公正的”，它在提出这个修正案之前没有同社会党商量。
