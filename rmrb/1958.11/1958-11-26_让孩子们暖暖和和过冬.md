Editor's Note:

    Keeping Children Warm Through the Winter
    The active efforts of Beijing's Party and government organizations to solve the winter heating problems of a large number of nurseries and kindergartens is a matter of great concern to the broad masses.

    Since the Great Leap Forward, a great number of nurseries and kindergartens have been established in rural areas and many cities across the country. The establishment of these childcare organizations has greatly liberated the labor force of housewives and increased the strength of industrial and agricultural production. These organizations were set up simply during the summer and autumn. Now that the weather is cold, whether the nurseries are warm enough and whether the children have enough winter clothing and bedding have become pressing concerns for the masses.

    In the past, when children were at home with their mothers who had not yet participated in production, keeping them warm in winter was a relatively simple matter. However, when millions of people entrust their children to nurseries for care, it becomes a major issue. Timely and proper resolution of the winter problems of nurseries and kindergartens, especially those offering full-time care, not only allows the masses to focus on production with peace of mind but also promotes the consolidation and development of rural people's communes and urban street production. Therefore, caring about and immediately resolving the winter problems of nurseries is not only a matter of mass perspective but also an important economic and political issue.

    Are there many difficulties in solving the winter problems of nurseries and kindergartens? Of course, there are difficulties. The key lies in the leadership's attention and following the mass line. Solving these problems for children is supported by the masses. As long as the leadership pays attention and everyone works together, many difficulties can be quickly resolved. It is recommended that all regions should, like Beijing, thoroughly check and resolve the winter problems of nurseries.

    让孩子们暖暖和和过冬
    北京市党政机关积极解决大量托儿所、幼儿园的过冬取暖问题，这是一件广大群众十分关切的问题。
    大跃进以来，全国农村和许多城市，都建立了许许多多的托儿所和幼儿园，这些托儿和幼儿组织的建立，大大解放了家庭妇女的劳动力，增加了工农业生产的力量。这些组织都是在夏秋之间，因陋就简办起来的。现在，天气冷了，托儿所的房屋是否暖和？孩子们的过冬衣被是否备齐了等等，就成了群众迫切关心的问题了。
    在过去，孩子们都在各自的家里，母亲们还没有参加生产时，孩子过冬是比较简单的事情。但是，当千百万群众把自己的孩子交给托儿所去抚育时，这就成了大事了。及时和妥善的解决托儿所和幼儿园特别是全托的过冬问题，不但可以使群众能够安心生产，而且也可以促进农村人民公社和城市街道生产的巩固发展。由此可见，关心和立即解决托儿所的过冬问题，不仅是一个群众观点问题，而且是项重要的经济和政治问题。
    解决托儿所、幼儿园的过冬问题是不是有很多困难呢？困难当然有。关键在于领导重视和走群众路线。给孩子解决这些问题是群众拥护的。只要领导重视，大家动手，许多困难都会很快解决。建议各地都应该像北京那样，很好地检查和解决一下托儿所的过冬问题。
