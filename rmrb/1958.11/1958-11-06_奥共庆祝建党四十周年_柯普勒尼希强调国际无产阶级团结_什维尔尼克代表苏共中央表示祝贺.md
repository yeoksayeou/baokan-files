Xinhua News Agency, November 5th: According to TASS Vienna: The Austrian Communist Party held a grand celebration in Vienna on the 4th, marking its 40th anniversary. Thousands of Communist Party members and supporters attended the event. Delegations from fraternal Communist and Workers' parties, including a delegation from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, attended the celebration of the Austrian Communist Party's 40th anniversary.

    Austrian Communist Party Chairman Koplenig addressed the gathering. He briefly reviewed the historical path traversed by the Austrian Communist Party over the past forty years. The party was founded shortly after the Great October Socialist Revolution and led the revolutionary struggle of the Austrian working class. After February 1934, the Austrian Communist Party went underground, uniting the masses into a united anti-fascist front. When German fascism extended its bloody hand to Austria, the party raised the banner of peace and national self-defense. After Hitler's defeat, the Communist Party made a decisive contribution to Austria's national revival.

    Koplenig pointed out that the Austrian Communist Party's loyalty to the working class and all the people of Austria over the past forty years is inseparable from its loyalty to the cause of socialism and the solidarity of the international proletariat. The fundamental changes that have taken place in the world over the past forty years demonstrate the victory of socialist ideology and Marxism-Leninism. The Austrian working class has enough strength to smash all the conspiracies of the reactionaries.

    Then, Shvernik, the head of the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, spoke. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he warmly congratulated the Austrian Communist Party on its glorious 40th anniversary.

    Shvernik pointed out that the Austrian Communist Party has been, is, and will always be loyal to Marxism-Leninism in the struggle for the interests of the working class, peace, democracy, and socialism. It is a heroic defender of the fundamental interests of the working people and a staunch fighter for Austrian independence. It has waged an irreconcilable struggle against reformism and opportunism, smashed the opportunist factions in its ranks, and further strengthened the party's unity under the banner of Marxism-Leninism.

    Speaking about the relationship between Austria and the Soviet Union, Shvernik said that the Soviet Union is ready to continue developing relations with Austria in the future on the basis of friendship, equality, and respect for sovereignty.

    Shvernik also spoke about the struggle of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries against the imperialists' war provocations and for lasting world peace. He pointed out that the American policy of aggression is doomed to failure.

    He also pointed out that the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties in November 1957 clearly showed that the fraternal parties had a complete consensus on the most important issues. The attempts by international reactionary forces to weaken this unity have completely failed.

    The Communist parties unanimously condemned the anti-Marxist activities of the Yugoslav revisionists. It is the responsibility of all Communists to directly and thoroughly defend Lenin's party's principled policy, to criticize any manifestation of revisionism, and to fight for the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory.

    奥共庆祝建党四十周年
    柯普勒尼希强调国际无产阶级团结
    什维尔尼克代表苏共中央表示祝贺
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社维也纳讯：4日在维也纳举行了奥地利共产党四十周年庆祝大会。参加大会的有数千名共产党员和拥护共产党的人。前来参加奥地利共产党四十周年庆祝会的有包括苏联共产党代表团在内的各兄弟共产党和工人党的代表团。
    奥地利共产党主席柯普勒尼希在会上讲了话。他扼要地回顾了奥地利共产党四十年来所走过的历史道路。这个党是在伟大的十月社会主义革命后不久建立起来的，它领导了奥地利工人阶级的革命斗争。在1934年2月以后奥地利共产党转入地下，它把群众团结成统一的反法西斯阵线。当德国法西斯把它的血手伸到奥地利时，这个党又高举起和平和民族自卫的旗帜。在希特勒失败以后，共产党对奥地利的民族复兴事业作出了决定性的贡献。
    柯普勒尼希指出，四十年来，奥地利共产党对工人阶级和奥地利全体人民的忠诚是同它对社会主义事业和国际无产阶级的团结的忠诚分不开的。世界上近四十年来所发生的根本变化表明了社会主义思想、马克思列宁主义思想的胜利。奥地利工人阶级有足够的力量去粉碎反动派的一切阴谋。
    接着由苏联共产党代表团团长什维尔尼克讲话。他代表苏联共产党中央委员会热烈祝贺奥地利共产党光荣的四十周年。
    什维尔尼克指出，奥地利共产党在争取工人阶级的利益、和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中过去、现在和将来永远忠于马克思列宁主义。它是劳动人民根本利益的英勇保卫者，是争取奥地利独立的坚强战士。它同改良主义和机会主义进行了不调和的斗争，粉碎了自己队伍中的机会主义派别，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下进一步加强了党的团结。
    在谈到奥地利同苏联的关系时，什维尔尼克说，苏联准备今后继续在友好、平等和尊重主权的基础上发展苏联同奥地利的关系。
    什维尔尼克还谈到了苏联和社会主义阵营各国反对帝国主义的战争挑衅、争取世界持久和平的斗争。他指出，美国的侵略政策注定要失败。
    他还指出1957年11月莫斯科的各国共产党和工人党代表会议明显地显示出，各兄弟党对于最重要的问题的观点是完全一致的。国际反动势力想要削弱这个团结的企图已经完全失败。
    共产党一致谴责了南斯拉夫修正主义者的反马克思主义活动。一切共产党人的责任就在于：直接而彻底地捍卫列宁的党的原则政策，批判修正主义的任何表现，为马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁性而斗争。
