Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, November 7th: An Iraqi Republic Radio commentary broadcast on the evening of the 6th exposed that the United States is plotting a multilateral conspiracy against the Arab liberation movement, particularly against the Iraqi Republic.

The commentary pointed out that the leaders of US imperialism are deeply disturbed by what they call "the recent developments in the Arab world, especially in Iraq." They believe that the only way for the West to control the situation and safeguard the interests of Western imperialism and its servants is to strengthen foreign military bases in the region and equip them with nuclear weapons.

The commentary said that imperialism may instigate Israel to launch aggression first, and then other imperialist troops in the region will provide necessary military assistance to Israel, or simply enter the battle. In the meantime, they are expanding reactionary conspiracies to undermine Arab countries from within.

At the same time, imperialism is also launching a deceptive and confusing offensive, attempting to mislead the Arab people into believing that US imperialism intends to change its policies and will provide them with selfless assistance, in order to gradually drag them onto the track of imperialist policies.

The commentary pointed out that the imperialist conspiracy is bound to fail. All Arab people will not believe the absurd myth that imperialism "harbors goodwill" towards them. The commentary also said that the revolutionary Iraqi Republic is determined to advance bravely on the road of complete liberation, Arab unity, and world peace under the leadership of the heroic leader Qasim. It is futile for imperialism and its lackeys to try to prevent the Iraqi Republic from taking its glorious path.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, November 7th: Lebanese parliamentarian Giham Hussein, when exclusively interviewed by Xinhua News Agency reporters in Tripoli on the 5th, said that the US government will never change its imperialist policy towards Arab countries. He said, "They may change the tactics and appearance of their policies, but the basic content will remain the same."

Referring to the proposed US "aid" to Lebanon, Hussein said, "The United States will not offer money unless it can get more benefits."

Referring to the failure of the US military's invasion of Lebanon, Hussein pointed out, "It was the imperialist attempt that failed completely."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 7th: Sudanese Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Rahman, who arrived in Cairo today, said in commenting on the results of the US congressional elections that US policies in recent years have been opposed by the American people.

He also said, "However, Arabs should not be optimistic about this result."

He expressed dissatisfaction with the US relationship with Israel. He criticized the United States for trying to forcibly impose its influence on the Middle East region and its lack of understanding of Arab views. He pointed out, "Regardless of which party is in power in the United States, Arabs will continue to suffer from the consequences of the United States' erroneous policies."

Rahman made the remarks to reporters from the Middle East News Agency. He pointed out that Sudanese public opinion believes that US "aid" to Sudan exceeds the scope stipulated by the Sudanese parliament for it. Recently, there have been reports that the United States is using US "aid" to restrict Sudan's foreign trade and other activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, November 6th: Aziz Sharif, Secretary-General of the National Committee of Iraqi Peace Fighters, and six committee members issued a protest against the US conclusion of a new military treaty with Iran, saying, "After the birth of the Iraqi Republic, the US imperialists who dispatched invading troops to land in the sister country of Lebanon failed to realize their aggressive plot against our republic and the entire Arab liberation movement. Therefore, when they were forced to withdraw from Lebanon, they prepared a new stronghold to conspire against our republic and neighboring countries. Therefore, they imposed a secret military aggression treaty on the Iranian people to replace the Baghdad Pact, which was fatally hit by our glorious revolution. The purpose of this new military aggression treaty is to establish missile bases in southern Iran and submarine bases on the Persian Gulf coast."

The protest pointed out that this treaty is a threat to the security of the people in the region, especially the security of the young Iraqi Republic. The protest said: Because our republic, under the leadership of the people's heroic leader Qasim, pursues a national, democratic, and peaceful policy, it has been, and still is, a thorn in the side of the imperialists.

The protest said: The Iraqi peace fighters believe that it is their responsibility in this delicate situation to remind the people of the dangers brought about by this treaty, which is part of the conspiracy planned by the imperialists against our republic. On behalf of the Iraqi peace fighters, we call on all patriotic Iraqi people to organize a broad movement to expose this treaty so that it will fail.

    看穿帝国主义豺狼本性难移
    中东舆论反对美国搞新侵略阴谋
    新华社巴格达7日电　伊拉克共和国电台在6日晚间广播的一篇评论，揭露美国正在策划一个反对阿拉伯解放运动特别是反对伊拉克共和国的多边的大阴谋。
    评论指出，美帝国主义的头子们对他们所谓的“阿拉伯世界特别是伊拉克最近局势的发展”深感不安。他们表示相信，西方控制局势和维护西方帝国主义及其仆从的利益的唯一方法，是加强这个地区的外国军事基地和以原子武器装备这些基地。
    评论说，帝国主义可能使以色列首先发动侵略，然后，其他地区的帝国主义军队把必要的军事援助供给以色列，或者干脆进入战斗。在这期间，他们扩大反动的阴谋活动，从内部破坏阿拉伯国家。
    同时，帝国主义还发动一个欺骗和迷惑的攻势，企图使阿拉伯人民误以为美帝国主义有意改变它的政策，并且将给他们提供无私的援助，以便把他们逐步拖上帝国主义政策的轨道。
    评论指出，帝国主义的阴谋一定要失败。所有阿拉伯人民都不会相信帝国主义对他们“抱有善意”的荒唐的神话。评论还说，革命的伊拉克共和国已经决心在英雄的领袖卡塞姆的领导下，在彻底解放、阿拉伯大团结和世界和平的大道上奋勇前进。帝国主义及其走狗企图阻挡伊拉克共和国走自己的光荣道路是枉费心机的。
    据新华社贝鲁特7日电　黎巴嫩议员给希姆·侯赛尼5日在的黎波里单独接见新华社记者时说，美国政府绝不会改变它对阿拉伯国家的帝国主义政策。他说，“他们也许可能改变他们的政策的策略和外貌，但是基本内容将照旧不变。”
    谈到建议中的美国对黎巴嫩的“援助”时，侯赛尼说，“除非美国能够取回更多的好处，否则他是不会拿出钱的。”
    侯赛尼在谈到美军侵略黎巴嫩失败这件事时指出，“完全失败的是帝国主义的企图”。
    据新华社开罗7日电　今天到达开罗的苏丹农业和商业部长拉赫曼在评论美国国会选举结果时说，最近几年来美国的政策遭到了美国人民的反对。
    他还说，“但是，阿拉伯人不应当对这个结果感到乐观”。
    他对美国同以色列的关系表示不满。他抨击美国试图对中东地区强行施加影响以及它不了解阿拉伯人的观点。他指出，“不论美国那一个党当政，阿拉伯人将会继续由于美国的错误政策的后果而受到损害。”
    拉赫曼是对中东通讯社的记者发表谈话的。他指出，苏丹的舆论认为，美国给苏丹的“援助”超出了苏丹议会为它规定的范围。最近有消息说，美国在通过美“援”来进行限制苏丹的对外贸易等活动。
    新华社巴格达6日电　伊拉克和平战士全国委员会总书记阿齐兹·谢里夫和六位委员就美国同伊朗缔结新的军事条约这件事发表抗议书说，“在伊拉克共和国诞生以后，派遣侵略军队在姊妹国家黎巴嫩登陆的美帝国主义者没有能够实现他们反对我们的共和国以及整个阿拉伯解放运动的侵略图谋。因此，当他们被迫撤出黎巴嫩的时候，他们准备一个新的据点来阴谋对付我们的共和国和邻近的国家。因此，他们把秘密的军事侵略条约强加于伊朗人民，来代替由于我们光荣的革命而遭到致命打击的巴格达条约。这个新的军事侵略条约的目的是要在伊朗南部建立导弹基地，并且在波斯湾海岸建立潜水艇基地。”
    抗议书指出，这个条约是对这个地区的人民的安全；特别是年轻的伊拉克共和国的安全的威胁。抗议书说：由于我们的共和国在人民英雄领袖卡塞姆的领导人奉行民族、民主和和平的政策，它过去是，现在仍然是帝国主义者的眼中钉。
    抗议书说：伊拉克的和平战士们认为，他们有责任在这个微妙的情况下提醒人民注意这个条约所带来的危险，这个条约是帝国主义者对我们共和国策划的阴谋的一部分。我们代表伊拉克的和平战士们，呼吁全体爱国的伊拉克人民们组织广泛的运动，来揭露这个条约，以使它遭到失败。
