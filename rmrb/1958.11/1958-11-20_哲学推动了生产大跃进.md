    Philosophy Promotes the Great Leap Forward in Production
    Jiang Shui
    In the process of studying political theory, workers at the Mudanjiang Cement Plant used the principles of "On Contradiction" to study the "dialectical relationship between increasing output and ensuring quality," creating a high-yield record for rapid kiln rotation in the Lepol kiln (i.e., large kiln), exceeding the unit area output of British large kilns by 202%.
    In order to increase cement production, the cement plant had held many meetings. Some technicians always believed that the hourly output of the large kiln had reached its peak according to its designed capacity, and it should not be increased any further, otherwise the quality could not be guaranteed. However, after studying "On Contradiction," the workers in the laboratory realized that everything is full of contradictions, and only by constantly resolving contradictions can we develop and advance. Therefore, they used this principle to study the contradiction between increasing output and ensuring quality.
    After several analyses and debates, they found that the focus of the contradiction was: the fixed cement mix formula limited the firepower, so that the kiln rotation speed could not be increased, and therefore the output could not be increased. The research concluded that cement raw materials, natural raw stone, and clay are constantly changing due to the influence of the four seasons, and the quality of raw stone from various places is not completely the same, but the batching work has always been carried out according to the original plan. The batching plan could not adapt to the constantly changing nature of the raw materials, and production could not be improved. After clarifying this inside story, they knew that to increase production, they had to solve the contradiction between the batching work and the raw material situation, and they had to abandon the original fixed batching plan and match the materials according to the seasonal climate changes and the quality of the raw materials.
    In a subsequent meeting, a debate unfolded between workers and technicians. The technicians still believed that increasing output and ensuring quality were fundamentally contradictory. Some even ridiculed the workers, saying, "You can't even boil half a pot of water, and you want to boil a whole pot!" The kiln operators immediately retorted, "The relationship between quality and quantity is a unity of opposites. You only see the opposition and not the unity, which is a one-sided view. You say you can't boil half a pot of water, that's true, but why can't you boil half a pot of water? That's because you are restricted by the batching plan, and you don't dare to add coal, fearing that the kiln temperature fluctuation will affect the quality. If we change the batching plan, we can increase the firepower and stabilize the temperature in the kiln, so that we can quickly boil not only half a pot of water, but also a whole pot."
    The cement plant's Party committee firmly supported the workers' pioneering spirit. The laboratory workers and technicians changed the batching method according to seasonal changes and the nature of the raw materials, increased the saturation coefficient, and increased the friability. The kiln operators also increased the firepower and accelerated the kiln's rotation speed (from 90 seconds per rotation to 56 seconds). In this way, the hourly output of the Lepol kiln increased from 29.4 tons to 36 tons.

    哲学推动了生产大跃进
    江水
    牡丹江水泥厂工人在学习政治理论过程中，运用“矛盾论”原理研究了“提高产量和保证质量的对立统一的辩证关系”，创造了立波尔窑（即大窑）快速转窑的高产纪录，超过英国大窑单位面积产量的202％。
    为了提高水泥产量，水泥厂曾召开过多次会议。有些技术人员总认为：大窑按设计能力的小时产量已达到顶点，绝不能再提高了，否则就不能保证质量。可是化验室的工人学习了“矛盾论”后，认识到一切事物都充满着矛盾，只有不断解决矛盾，才能发展前进。于是他们就运用这个原理来研究提高产量和保证质量的矛盾。
    经过几次分析、辩论，他们找到了矛盾的焦点是：固定不变的水泥配料方案限制了火力，以致转窑速度不能提高，所以产量提不高。研究的结果认为，水泥原料，自然的原石、粘土是受四季气候的影响不断在变化的，采自各地的原石质量也不完全一样，可是配料工作却始终按照原定方案进行。配料方案就不能适应经常变化着的原料的性质，生产也就不能提高。他们弄清楚了这个内情，就知道了要提高生产，就得解决配料工作和原料情况不相适合的矛盾，就得抛弃原来的固定不变的配料方案，而随着四季气候变化和原料质量去配料。
    在随后的一次碰头会上，工人和技术人员间展开了一场争论。技术人员仍旧认为提高产量和保证质量是根本矛盾的。有的人还讽刺工人说：“你们连半锅水都烧不开，还想烧一锅水哩！”窑头看火工人立即驳斥道：“质和量的关系是对立统一的关系。你们只看到对立，看不到统一，这是片面观点。你们说烧不开半锅水，这是事实，但为甚么烧不开半锅水呢？这就是因为受配料方案限制，不敢加煤，怕窑温波动影响质量。如果改变了配料方案，我们就能加大火力，使窑内温度稳定，这样不要说半锅水，就是一锅水也很快就能烧开了。”
    水泥厂党委坚决支持了工人们的首创精神。化验室工人和技术人员根据季节变化和原材料的性质，改变了配料方法，提高了饱合系数，增加了易碎性。大窑看火工人也加大了火力，加快了窑的转速（由过去每转九十秒加快到五十六秒）。这样，立波尔窑每小时产量就由过去的二九点四吨提高到三十六吨。
