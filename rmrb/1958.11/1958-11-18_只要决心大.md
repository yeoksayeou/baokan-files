　　The gantry planer cannot be bought,
　　Resolutely refuse to ask the higher-ups for it,
　　If you want to put it into production quickly,
　　Rely on our own efforts to create it with indigenous methods.
　　We are not afraid of not having steel,
　　What does it matter if the tools are backward?
　　As long as we have great determination,
　　We can carve it out by hand, gnaw it with our teeth, and make it happen.
　　(Jiaohe Iron Factory, Tianjin Special District)

    只要决心大
    龙门刨，买不到，
    坚决不向上级要，
    要想投入生产快，
    自力更生土法造。
    没有钢铁咱不怕，
    工具落后又算啥，
    只要我们决心大，
    手刻牙啃搞成它。
