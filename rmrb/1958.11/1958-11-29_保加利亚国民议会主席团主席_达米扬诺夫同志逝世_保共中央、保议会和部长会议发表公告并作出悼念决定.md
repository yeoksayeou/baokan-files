Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 27th.

G. Damyanov was a loyal student and comrade-in-arms of Georgi Dimitrov, one of the oldest and most seasoned fighters of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and an active figure in the international workers' and communist movement. G. Damyanov unflinchingly and heroically endured the flames of the heroic September Uprising of 1923 and, during the years of fascist rule and war, carried out vigorous activities as a fearless proletarian revolutionary and activist of the Communist International. Since the victory of September 9, 1944, he dedicated all his energy to the construction of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and its armed forces, and to the work of uniting the working people under the banner of the Fatherland Front and strengthening the spiritual and political unity of the people.

Comrade G. Damyanov was infinitely loyal to the great principles of Marxism-Leninism, an unyielding fighter defending the purity and iron unity of the Party ranks and a passionate patriot and internationalist, and a staunch defender of the unbreakable friendship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.

He won the heartfelt respect and love of the working people for his loyalty to the people and for his excellent qualities as a communist party member.

G. Damyanov consciously dedicated his entire life to the struggle to liberate the people from the oppression of capitalism, monarchist dictatorship, and fascism, and to the great cause of the Communist Party, the victory of socialism in our country.

Comrade G. Damyanov's entire beneficial activity of serving the Party and the people will be a moving example for workers, peasants, and all working people in the struggle for the further prosperity of our socialist motherland.
