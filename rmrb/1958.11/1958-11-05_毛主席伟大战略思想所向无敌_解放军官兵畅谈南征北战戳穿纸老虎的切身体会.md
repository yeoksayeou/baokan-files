Xinhua News Agency, November 4th: Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Beijing area are enthusiastically studying the important document "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers." In their discussions, they connect it with their own and their units' glorious combat experiences, using many facts to prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's great strategic and military thought.

The generals and commanders of various military academies and schools have been reading this important document diligently these past few days, feeling infinitely close and encouraged. Five veteran Red Army soldiers from the Political Academy, Wei Zuzhen, Kuang Kantian, Zhang Wenbi, Xie Jiaxiang, and Ma Zeying, spoke freely at the discussion, combining their own rich experience of over 20 years of struggle, about the brilliance of Chairman Mao's thesis that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." General Wei Zuzhen said, "For more than 20 years, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, from the 25,000-li Long March to entering the great period of socialist construction, the unwavering understanding I have gained is that Chairman Mao's words are scientific predictions before things happen, and after things happen, they are proven to be brilliant judgments. Therefore, historical facts tell us that we must always listen to Chairman Mao, earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought, in order to arm our own revolutionary minds, not fear any powerful enemy, defeat and eliminate all enemies, and strive for the final victory of the proletarian revolution." General Xie Jiaxiang, who joined the Red Army at the age of sixteen, recalled his more than 20 years of revolutionary struggle and said that Chairman Mao's great strategic and military thought is invincible. As early as the most difficult period of the revolution, when the forces of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries were very strong, and the revolutionary forces were still very weak, Chairman Mao pointed out that "a single spark can start a prairie fire," which played a significant guiding and encouraging role in our people's revolutionary struggle. This brilliant thesis gave us a clear political direction and goal, believing that the revolution would surely be victorious. Therefore, the more arduous the struggle, the higher our confidence in victory, so we became a people's army that could not be defeated, crushed, or conquered.

The officers and soldiers of various services and arms of the PLA stationed in Beijing, in their study and discussion of Chairman Mao's important document, have further strengthened their revolutionary fighting spirit and further despised American imperialism and all enemies. Senior Colonel Li Jiuhu, political commissar of a certain division, said that with Chairman Mao's ideological weapon, we eliminated the millions of Kuomintang troops armed by American imperialism and defeated Japanese imperialism. Today, facing the aggression and war provocations of American imperialism, we will work harder to study and master Chairman Mao's military thought, despise the enemy strategically, value the enemy tactically, and strive for the final victory of the revolutionary struggle. Lieutenant Colonel Li Rufu of a certain artillery unit said that Chairman Mao's great thought is our guide to action. During the Liberation War, the Kuomintang reactionaries' New First Army and New Sixth Army were all equipped with American mechanized equipment, which looked really impressive on the surface, while we at that time only had "millet plus rifles, two legs chasing mechanization." However, because we were a people's army and saw through the paper tiger nature of the reactionaries, the soldiers were incomparably heroic at the time, saying: "When eating vegetables, eat only the heart of the cabbage; when fighting, only fight the New First Army!" Therefore, the Kuomintang's "elite" troops were completely annihilated by us.

The officers and soldiers of a certain air force unit also believe in their studies that the publication of Chairman Mao's document "On Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" will not only further enhance the Chinese people's will to fight against American imperialist aggression and liberate their territories of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, but will also play a huge encouraging role in the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, especially the people of the colonies.

    毛主席伟大战略思想所向无敌
    解放军官兵畅谈南征北战戳穿纸老虎的切身体会
    据新华社4日讯　中国人民解放军驻北京地区各机关部队的官兵们热烈展开对“毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的重要文献的学习。他们在座谈讨论中，联系本身和部队的光荣战斗经历，用许多事实来证明毛主席的伟大战略思想和军事思想的正确。
    各军事院、校的将军们和指挥员们，连日来手不释卷地阅读这一重要文献，感到无限亲切和鼓舞。政治学院的韦祖珍、况阚田、张文碧、谢家祥、马泽迎等五位老红军战士，在座谈会上都结合自己二十多年的丰富斗争经历，畅谈毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论断的英明。韦祖珍将军说：“二十多年来，我们在毛主席的英明领导下，从两万五千里长征到进入伟大的社会主义建设时期，对我来说，得到的一个坚定不移的认识是：毛主席的话，在事物发生之前，是科学的预见，而在事物发生之后，便被实践证明是英明的论断。所以，历史事实告诉我们，要永远听毛主席的话，认真学习毛泽东思想，才能够武装起自己的革命头脑，不怕任何强大的敌人，打败和消灭一切敌人，争取无产阶级革命的最后胜利。”从十六岁就参加了红军的谢家祥将军在回忆了他二十多年的革命斗争历史以后说，毛主席的伟大战略思想和军事思想是战无不胜的。早在革命最艰苦的时期，当时帝国主义和国民党反动派的势力非常强大，而革命的力量还很弱小的时候，毛主席就指出了“星星之火，可以燎原”，对于我国人民的革命斗争，起了重大的指导和鼓舞作用。这个英明的论断，使我们有了明确的政治方向和奋斗目标，相信革命一定能胜利。因此，斗争越艰苦，我们的胜利信心越高，所以成为一支打不垮、压不倒，战无不胜、攻无不克的人民军队。
    驻北京各军种、兵种部队的官兵们，在对毛主席这一重要文献的学习和讨论中，进一步增强了革命斗志，更加藐视美帝国主义和一切敌人。某师政治委员李九虎大校说，我们有了毛主席的思想武器，才消灭了美帝国主义武装起来的几百万国民党军队，才打败了日本帝国主义。今天，我们面对着美帝国主义的侵略和战争挑衅，将更加努力地学习和掌握毛主席的军事思想，在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人，争取革命斗争的最后胜利。炮兵某部李如夫中校说，毛主席的伟大思想就是我们行动的指南。在解放战争中，当时国民党反动派的新一军和新六军，全部是美国的机械化装备，表面上看起来真威风，而我们那时候还只有“小米加步枪，两条腿追机械化”，可是由于我们是人民军队，看透了反动派纸老虎的面目，当时战士们英勇无比地说：“吃菜专吃白菜心，打仗专打新一军！”所以，国民党的“精锐”部队也就在我们的手下全被歼灭了。
    空军某部队的官兵们在学习中还认为，现在发表毛主席“论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文献，不但能够进一步增强我国人民反对美帝国主义侵略和解放自己领土台、澎、金、马的斗争意志，而且对全世界人民，特别是对殖民地人民的革命斗争，也将起着巨大的鼓舞作用。
