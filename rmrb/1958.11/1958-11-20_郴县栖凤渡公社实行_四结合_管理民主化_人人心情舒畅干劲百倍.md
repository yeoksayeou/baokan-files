    Qifengdu Commune in Chen County Implements "Four Combinations" for Democratic Management
    Everyone Feels Happy and Works with Redoubled Effort

    (Our report) The Qifengdu People's Commune in Chen County, Hunan Province, while realizing organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization, further implemented the democratization of production, life, economy, finance, and labor management. A lively and vigorous situation quickly emerged throughout the commune, with both centralization and democracy, both unified will and personal happiness. The morale of the commune members was greatly boosted, their enthusiasm redoubled, and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production was powerfully promoted.

    Since the establishment of the Qifengdu Commune at the end of August, in order to adapt to the new situation of rapid development in industry and agriculture, organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization were implemented, and an unprecedented production upsurge quickly appeared. The attendance rate quickly increased from around 45% to over 65%; in agricultural production, seven days of work efficiency equaled twenty days of work efficiency in September; especially in pig iron production, from a foundation of nothing, the daily output reached more than six tons; other cultural education, health and welfare undertakings, etc., also showed a new outlook.

    However, "Three-izations" was still a new thing that had never been done before. The commune and team cadres lacked experience, and some cadres had wrong ideas, thinking that with "Three-izations" they could do without in-depth and meticulous work, and some even thought: since the commune controls the grain, there is no need to worry about the masses not listening. Therefore, some team cadres forgot that consulting with the masses and promoting democracy, following the mass line, is the Party's fine tradition. Their leadership in production consisted only of the company commander (who was also the production team leader) issuing temporary orders every morning. Commune members did not know what they would be doing tomorrow, resulting in a situation where going to work was like a dragon, but doing things was like a swarm. When problems occurred in production, or when some people violated discipline because they were not yet accustomed to the "Three-izations," the cadres did not adopt a patient education attitude, but criticized them at every turn. As a result, the production enthusiasm of a few commune members declined, and they had opinions about the cadres.

    After discovering this situation, the commune Party committee believed that this was a major issue concerning the consolidation of the commune and the development of production. Immediately, at various meetings, in conjunction with studying and deploying production, the cadres throughout the commune were repeatedly educated on the mass line. On the one hand, it was explained that only by promoting democracy can the "Three-izations" be consolidated and production be done well. On the other hand, good and bad examples of promoting democracy were seized, and vivid facts were used to educate the cadres. Lei Zhengxian, the captain (and company commander) of the Zhuangmen squad of the Third Brigade, at the beginning of implementing the "Three-izations," found that the labor organization in the squad was very chaotic, there was no responsibility system, and the organization of specialized teams was unsound, resulting in serious idleness. Lei Zhengxian convened three commune member meetings in a row, calling on the commune members to speak out freely and fully, and according to the opinions of the commune members, he proposed "Four Combinations" – "Three-izations" must be combined with democracy, "Three-izations" must be combined with the determination of basic working days, "Three-izations" must be combined with the specification of production tasks, and "Three-izations" must be combined with regular evaluation and inspection. As a result of the Four Combinations, the production enthusiasm of the masses soared, and production quickly got on the right track. The Unity Company (squad) of the Second Brigade, because the team cadres' understanding of the relationship between high concentration and high democracy was not correct, mistakenly believing that "things are easy now, just issue an order." During the autumn harvest and planting, the captain and deputy captain neither led production with production, nor consulted with the masses when problems arose. When commune members had shortcomings, their methods were three: criticism, debate, and deduction of meals (i.e., not providing meals). Therefore, the masses had great opinions, their production enthusiasm was not high, and the completion of the autumn harvest and planting tasks was greatly affected.

    After a series of education, the commune and team cadres correctly recognized the dialectical relationship between high concentration and high democracy, and that "Three-izations" plus "One-ization" is the icing on the cake. On the basis of improving the ideological level of the commune and team cadres, a widespread and in-depth democratic movement was immediately launched throughout the commune, mobilizing the broad masses to speak out freely and fully, and put forward criticisms and suggestions on all aspects of the commune's production, life, economy, finance, labor management, and the leadership style of the cadres. Based on the opinions put forward by the commune members, the commune Party committee, after careful analysis and research, resolutely adopted the following measures: 1. Established democratic organizations and democratic systems. The team affairs management committee and the commune member representative assembly were established in the brigade and the squad respectively, the canteen management committee was established in the public canteen, the technical advisory committee was established in the agricultural technology aspect, the financial work inquiry office was also established in the financial aspect, and a system for publishing accounts on time was determined; each team also set up democracy columns, democracy walls, suggestion boxes, etc., to listen to the opinions of the masses and constantly improve the work through various forms. 2. Commune and team cadres must lead production with production. It is stipulated that brigade cadres must work at least eighty working days a year, squad cadres must work at least one hundred and thirty working days a year, and different requirements are also put forward for commune cadres according to different situations. 3. Taking the team as a unit, launch a "Five Goods" (good work attitude, good obedience to leadership, good love for the commune as home, good observance of discipline, good unity and mutual assistance) competition among commune members, with a small evaluation every ten days and a big evaluation every month, to supervise each other and promote each other. 4. Divide production responsibility areas and establish various specialized teams to put production on a planned basis.

    On the basis of "Three-izations," plus the important content of "democratic management," many problems that had never been solved in this commune were quickly resolved; the commune members' production enthusiasm was very high, and an unprecedented new upsurge appeared in industrial and agricultural production.

    郴县栖凤渡公社实行“四结合”管理民主化
    人人心情舒畅干劲百倍
    本报讯　湖南省郴县栖凤渡人民公社由于在实现组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化的同时，进一步贯彻了生产、生活、经济、财务、劳动管理民主化，在全社范围内很快出现了既有集中，又有民主，既有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅的生动活泼的局面，社员精神面貌大为振奋，干劲百倍，有力地推动了工农业生产大跃进。
    栖凤渡公社自从8月底建成以后，为了适应工农业飞跃发展的新形势，实行了组织军事化、行动战斗化和生活集体化，很快出现了从未有过的生产高潮。出勤率很快由原先的45％左右提高到了65％以上；在农业生产上，七天的工效等于9月份二十天的工效；特别是在生铁生产从没有一点根底的基础上，日产量达六吨多；其他文化教育、卫生福利事业等，也出现了新气象。
    但是，“三化”究竟还是一件从未搞过的新事情，社队干部还缺乏经验，加上部分干部有错误认识，以为有了“三化”就可以不做深入细致的工作了，个别的甚至还认为：粮食掌握在社里，不怕群众不听话。因此，个别队干部就忘记了有事和群众商量，发扬民主，走群众路线是党的优良传统。他们领导生产，只是每天清早由连长（又是生产队长）临时发布命令，社员做了今天不知明天的活，因而经常出现出工一条龙，做事一窝蜂的现象；生产中发生了问题，或者部分群众因为对“三化”还没有习惯而违反纪律的时候，干部也不是采取耐心教育的态度，动辄批评；这样一来，少数社员的生产情绪低落，对干部有意见。
    公社党委发现这一情况后，认为这是一个关系着公社巩固、生产发展的重大问题。随即在各种会议上，结合研究布置生产，对全社干部反复进行了群众路线的教育。一方面说明只有发扬民主，才能巩固“三化”、搞好生产的道理。另一方面，抓住发扬民主的好坏典型，用活的事实向干部进行教育。第三大队庄门中队队长（又是连长）雷正先，在实行“三化”的开始，队里劳动组织很乱，没有责任制，专业队的组织又不健全，窝工现象很严重。雷正先一连召开了三次社员大会，号召社员大鸣大放，根据社员的意见，提出了“四结合”——“三化”必须与民主相结合，“三化”必须与确定基本工作日相结合，“三化”必须与生产任务具体化相结合，“三化”必须与经常评比检查相结合。四大结合的结果，群众生产积极性高涨，生产很快走上正轨。第二大队的团结中队（连），由于队干部对高度集中与高度民主的关系认识不够正确，错误地认为“这下事情好办了，只要下一道命令就行了”。在秋收秋种中，正副队长既不以生产领导生产，有了问题也不与群众商量，社员有了缺点，他们的办法是三条：一批评，二辩论，三扣钵子（即不开餐）。因此，群众意见很大，生产积极性不高，大大影响了秋收秋种任务的完成。
    社队干部经过一系列的教育，正确认识到高度集中和高度民主的辩证关系，“三化”加“一化”，是锦上添花。在提高社队干部思想水平的基础上，随即在全社范围内开展了一个广泛深入的民主运动，发动广大群众大鸣大放，对社的生产、生活、经济、财务、劳动管理、干部的领导作风等各个方面提出批评，提出建议。社党委会根据社员提出的意见，经过认真的分析研究，坚决采取了如下几项措施：一、建立了民主机构和民主制度。在大队、中队分别成立了队务管理委员会、社员代表大会，在公共食堂成立了食堂管理委员会，在农业技术方面成立了技术顾问委员会，财务方面也成立了财务工作问讯处，并确定了按时公布账目的制度；各个队还设立了民主栏、民主墙、意见箱等等，通过各种形式，听取群众意见，不断改进工作。二、社队干部必须以生产领导生产。规定大队干部一年至少做八十个工作日，中队干部一年至少做一百三十个工作日，对社干部也根据不同情况提出了不同要求。三、以队为单位，发动社员开展“五好”（劳动态度好，服从领导好，爱社如家好，遵守纪律好，团结互助好）的竞赛，十天一小评，一月一大评，互相监督，相互促进。四、划分生产责任区，成立各种专业队，使生产走上计划化。
    在“三化”基础上，加上了“管理民主化”的重要内容后，这个公社很多从未解决的问题，很快得到解决；社员生产积极性非常高涨，工农业生产出现了一个从未有过的新高潮。
