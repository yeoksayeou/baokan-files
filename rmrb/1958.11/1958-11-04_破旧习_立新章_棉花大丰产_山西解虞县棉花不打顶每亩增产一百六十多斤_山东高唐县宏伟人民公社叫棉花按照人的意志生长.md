Breaking Old Habits, Establishing New Rules, Achieving a Bumper Cotton Harvest
    Shanxi's Jieyu County Increases Cotton Yield by Over 160 Jin Per Mu by Not Topping
    Hongwei People's Commune in Gaotang County, Shandong, Commands Cotton to Grow According to Human Will

    This newspaper reports that cotton farmers in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, boldly abandoned the thousand-year-old habit of topping cotton plants this year, creating a new cultivation technique of not topping cotton, allowing the cotton to grow as much as possible, and producing more bolls. As a result, the county achieved a bumper cotton harvest. Preliminary estimates show that the average yield of seed cotton per mu in the county is 1,003 jin, of which the increase due to not topping averaged 168 jin per mu.

    As the reporter entered Jieyu County, he saw large swathes of un-topped cotton plants with tall branches and numerous bolls. The contrast between the cotton fields was even more striking: cotton that had not been topped was still growing vigorously in this late autumn. In the "satellite fields," the lower cotton bolls were already ripe, while the upper parts were still flowering and budding. In contrast, the cotton that had been topped had already turned yellow and withered. According to technical cadres here, the average plant height of cotton that was topped and not further processed (according to past habits) was two chi five cun, with 13.5 bolls. The average number of bolls on cotton that was topped and continued to be processed was 29, with 18 fruit branches. However, the average plant height of cotton that was not topped but processed as usual was three chi five cun, with the tallest exceeding four chi, with 23.5 fruit branches and 36 or 7 bolls. The bolls were large, with an average of 80 bolls per jin of seed cotton (compared to an average of 100 bolls per jin for topped cotton). People here also told reporters that cotton plants that are not topped also undergo some new changes: topped cotton plants have longer fruit branches and more axillary shoots, thus requiring more processing (pruning axillary shoots two or three times) and are also more difficult to manage. Untopped cotton plants, because they can grow upwards, have shorter fruit branches and no axillary shoots.

    Jieyu County is one of the cotton and wheat producing areas in southern Shanxi. This year, during the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the vast numbers of cadres and cotton farmers were enthusiastic and spirited, proposing a target of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu. To this end, the county further promoted close planting, fully adopted the Dai-character cotton variety, sowed seeds five days earlier, and rationally applied phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers. To ensure the realization of the leap forward targets, the county party committee paid special attention to the issue of cotton topping. According to local customs, the masses began topping in July, more than three months before "Frost's Descent." The county party committee believed that if the development of cotton was restricted too early, it would be impossible to achieve the plan. Therefore, it decided to postpone topping and strengthen later management. In August, the county party committee put forward the slogan of cultivating "satellite fields." When studying measures to achieve high yields, they found that cotton fields that had been secretly topped by the masses had stopped growing, but cotton that had not been topped was still green and leafy, showing great potential for development. They then decided that "satellite fields" should not be topped under any circumstances, and large fields should be topped as late as possible. Because the county party committee adopted many effective measures, and the vast numbers of cotton farmers saw that untopped cotton indeed grew well and had more bolls, the experience of not topping was quickly promoted.

    In the process of proposing late topping and finally deciding not to top, the county party committee insisted on the later processing of cotton fields. They demanded "as long as the cotton lives, processing does not stop." After "Beginning of Autumn," the county's 130,000 mu of untopped cotton fields were watered, fertilized, and cultivated several times using the method of small amounts and frequent applications. The county also broke down production boundaries and adopted a method of large-scale cooperation and blitzkrieg to eliminate pests. When the communes were established, the slogan of "do not allow the three categories of seedlings to enter the commune" more forcefully promoted later processing.

    The decision not to top cotton in Jieyu County this year was a change from historical tradition, and therefore was full of ideological struggle. After the county party committee proposed late topping of cotton, the masses were temporarily confined by old habits and secretly topped the cotton, resulting in 14.5% of the county's cotton fields being topped. After the county party committee held several on-site meetings, allowing the masses to see if they didn't believe it, and to debate if they didn't understand, and after some cotton farmers secretly conducted comparative experiments themselves, the county achieved a great victory with 85.5% of cotton fields not being topped.

    This newspaper reports that not pruning and topping cotton, and not topping the apical buds in the seedling stage, so that it grows more than two apical branches, can increase the yield per plant by about one time. These two valuable experiments were conducted by the Hongwei People's Commune in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, which was once inspected by Chairman Liu Shaoqi.

    In the wave of the Great Leap Forward, the personnel of the Hongwei Commune's cotton "satellite" fields broke superstitions, and all seven mu of cotton experimental fields were not "side-hearted" or "top-pointed." They also conducted experiments in ordinary high-yield fields, topping the apical buds when the cotton seedlings had only four true leaves and four fruit branches. The result was that each grew two and four apical branches, increasing the number of fruit branches and fruit nodes, and basically achieving success. According to the measurement of the "satellite" acceptance group of the Gaotang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, these seven mu of cotton plants were about six chi high, with the highest reaching eight chi; about thirty fruit branches; and according to 5,500 plants per mu, with an average of 65 old peaches per plant, the average yield of seed cotton per mu was 8,000 jin.

    When the cotton seedlings had four true leaves, topping the apical buds resulted in two parallel branches, 118 centimeters high, with a total of 36 fruit branches, 93 buds and bolls, of which 81 were old peaches; the boll drop was 25%. When the four fruit branches were topped, four parallel branches, 127 centimeters high, grew, with 79 fruit branches and 99 buds and bolls, of which 91 were old peaches, but the boll drop reached 41%. However, a spot check of ten cotton plants with the same growth conditions that were not topped at the seedling stage clearly showed that cotton plants that were topped at the seedling stage had about twice as many buds and bolls per plant, and the drop was still relatively small. The experiment of topping apical buds in the seedling stage is one of the methods of close planting, which can reduce the lower main stem of cotton plants, making it easier to cultivate; avoiding the depression in the lower part of the cotton field, causing early boll drop. At the same time, because the number of upper branches increases, it can fully utilize the upper space and utilize solar energy. (Sun Jing)

    破旧习  立新章  棉花大丰产
    山西解虞县棉花不打顶每亩增产一百六十多斤
    山东高唐县宏伟人民公社叫棉花按照人的意志生长
    本报讯　山西省解虞县棉农今年大胆抛弃千年植棉打顶的习惯，创造了棉花不打顶，让棉花尽量生长，多结果铃的新耕作技术，因而全县获得了棉花大丰收。初步测定：全县棉田平均亩产籽棉一千零三斤，其中因不打顶而增产的部分平均每亩一百六十八斤。
    当记者进入解虞县境，即看到大片大片未打顶的棉花枝秆高大，果铃累累。对比棉田给人印象更加深刻：凡是未打顶的棉花，在此深秋仍然生长旺盛，“卫星田”里的棉株，下部棉铃已经成熟，而上部还在开花现蕾；而打了顶的棉花，早已枝叶枯黄。据这里的技术干部测算：打顶后按过去习惯不再加工的棉花，平均株高二尺五寸，结铃十三点五个；打顶后继续加工的棉花，平均结铃二十九个，果枝十八个；但是没有打顶照常加工的棉花，平均株高三尺五寸，最高的四尺多，果枝二十三点五个，结铃三十六、七个，果铃硕大，平均八十多个摘一斤籽棉（打顶的平均一百个果铃摘一斤）。这里的人还告诉记者，棉花不打顶后，植株也有某些新变化：已打顶的，果枝较长，芽枝多，因而需要加工多（打芽枝二、三次），管理也不方便；未打枝的棉花，因能向上生长，所以果枝较短，没有芽枝。
    解虞县是晋南棉麦产区之一。今年农业大跃进，广大干部和棉农干劲冲天，意气风发，提出亩产籽棉一千斤的指标。为此，全县进一步推行了密植，全部采用了岱字棉种，提早五天下种，合理施用了磷氮肥。为了确保跃进指标的实现，县委特别注意棉花的打顶问题。按当地习惯，7月群众即开始打顶，距“霜降”还有三个多月。县委认为如果过早限制棉花的发育，即不可能实现计划。因此决定推迟打顶，同时加强后期管理。8月间，县委提出培植“卫星田”的号召。他们在研究实现高额丰产措施的时候，发现已经由群众暗中打顶的棉田，棉花停止了生长，但未打顶的棉花还是青枝绿叶，大有发展前途，便决定“卫星田”无论如何不让打顶，大田尽量晚打顶。由于县委采取了许多有效措施，和广大棉农看到了不打顶的棉花的确生长好，果铃多，因此不打顶的经验迅速得到推广。
    县委在提出晚打顶和最后决定不打顶的过程中，坚持了棉田的后期加工。他们要求“棉花不死，加工不止”。“立秋”以后，全县十三万亩未打顶的棉田，用少量多餐的办法进行了好几次浇水、追肥、中耕。全县还打破生产界限，采取大协作、大突击的方式消灭虫害。在成立公社的时候，“不让三类苗入社”的口号，更有力地推动了后期加工。
    解虞县今年棉花不打顶是改变历史传统，因此充满了思想斗争。当县委提出棉花晚打顶后，群众一时囿于旧习，暗自摘打，结果全县有14.5％的棉田打了顶。在县委召开了几次现场会议，让群众不信就看，不通就辩，并在某些棉农自己暗中进行了对比试验之后，全县才取得85.5％棉田不打顶的大胜利。
    本报讯　棉花不经整枝打杈，在幼苗期不打顶尖，使其生长出两个以上的顶端分枝，能使单株产量提高一倍左右。这两种有价值的试验，是刘少奇委员长曾经视察过的山东省高唐县宏伟人民公社进行的。
    在大跃进的声浪中，宏伟社棉花“卫星”田的人员，大破迷信，七亩棉花试验田全部没有“打边心”、“打顶尖”。他们又在一般丰产田里，在棉苗只有四片真叶、四个果枝时，进行了打去顶尖的试验，结果各生出两个和四个顶端分枝，增加果枝、果节，都基本上获得成功。根据中共高唐县委“卫星”验收团的测产，这七亩棉花株高六尺左右，最高达到八尺；果枝三十个左右；按每亩五千五百株，平均每株六十五个老桃计算，平均亩产籽棉八千斤。
    棉苗在四片真叶时，打去顶尖，生长出两个平行的一百一十八厘米高的分枝，共有果枝三十六个，蕾铃九十三个，其中老桃达八十一个；蕾铃脱落25％。四个果枝时打去顶尖，则生长出四个平行的一百二十七厘米高的分枝，有果枝七十九个，九十九个蕾铃，其中老桃达九十一个，唯蕾铃脱落达41％。但在它们周围抽查生长条件相同的十株没有在幼苗期打顶尖的棉花，明显的看出，幼苗时打顶尖生分枝的棉株，单株蕾铃增加一倍左右，脱落仍是比较少。在幼苗期打去顶尖的试验，是密植的方法之一，可使棉株下部主干减少，便于中耕；避免棉田下部郁闷，造成早期蕾铃脱落。同时，由于上部分株增多，能充分利用上部空间，利用太阳能。　（孙静）
