Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 6th: A grand rally of working people from all walks of life in Moscow celebrating the 41st anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution was held today at 5:00 PM in a spirited atmosphere at the Sports Palace of the Lenin Stadium.

　　The Lenin Stadium was dressed in festive attire, with a solemn and majestic atmosphere. Red flags fluttered around the Sports Palace, and the lights shone brightly. Inside the Sports Palace hung the Soviet national emblem and the flags of the fifteen Soviet republics. Across from the rostrum hung a banner with the slogan "Glory to Our Dear Communist Party." Above the rostrum hung a huge portrait of Lenin, and a large banner read: "Long Live the 41st Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution." On either side of the banner were the large characters "1917" "1958."

　　The conference was jointly hosted by the Moscow City Soviet and the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

　　More than 10,000 people attended the meeting. Soviet party and government leaders Voroshilov, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Mikoyan, Suslov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, and others attended the meeting. Foreign delegations, including the Polish People's Republic delegation led by Gomulka and the Chinese Laboring People's Observation Group led by Liu Lantao, also attended the meeting.

　　Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Mikoyan, delivered a report on the 41st anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

　　In his report, Mikoyan first emphasized that the October Revolution opened up a broad road for all mankind to fight for peace, democracy, and socialism. He said that the prosperity of truly people's power, the promotion of socialist democracy, the unbreakable family of all free nations of the Soviet Union, the unprecedented upsurge of the Soviet Union's economic strength, the now recognized development of science, technology, culture, and art, and the continuous improvement of the material well-being of the Soviet people—all of this is the practical fruit of the October Revolution.

　　Mikoyan pointed out that even those who cannot be called our friends now admit that the Soviet people have achieved unprecedented achievements in history. He said that the formation of the great family of socialist countries and the great achievements made by various countries in the socialist camp are new miracles in the world.

　　Mikoyan said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are victoriously struggling to establish the material and technical foundation of communism."

　　He pointed out that the Soviet Union completed more than 103% of its industrial production plan for the first ten months of 1958. The Soviet Union's industrial product production is now thirty-six times that of pre-October Revolution Russia. Last year, the level of the United Kingdom was only 1.8 times the level of 1913, and the United States was only 4.1 times.

　　Mikoyan said that the Soviet Union has taken a new and important step this year in solving the basic economic task of catching up with and surpassing the major capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output.

　　In 1958, the Soviet Union is implementing an ambitious basic construction plan. This year, the basic investment in the national economy will exceed the sum of the basic investments of the first and second five-year plans, exceeding the investment of 1957 by 11%.

　　Mikoyan pointed out that Soviet agriculture has achieved great achievements. This year is a year of great harvest in the Soviet Union, and approximately 3.5 billion poods of grain have been purchased, greatly exceeding the unprecedentedly fruitful year of 1956. This year, the Soviet Union's total milk production will catch up with the level of the United States.

　　The speaker pointed out that the stage experienced by the Soviet state since the September 1953 Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has actually come to an end with the agricultural production results of this year. This past stage marks "the great victory of our party's general line for agriculture."

　　Mikoyan then said that this year is a year of further improvement in the people's material well-being. During this year, the Soviet Union's national income will increase by 8%. The increase in national income this year alone is equal to the total national income of the country in 1930.

　　The speaker pointed out that in the past two years, the total retail trade has increased by more than 20%. The goods sold this year (calculated at comparable prices) will increase by 2.7 times compared with 1940. This year, the total area of housing built for urban residents will reach more than 62 million square meters.

　　Mikoyan said that the upsurge in the enthusiasm of the masses of urban and rural people, the further promotion of socialist democracy, and the strengthening of party-mass relations have greatly promoted the achievements of our country's economic development.

　　The speaker emphasized that the achievements of this year make it clearer that the position of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, and Shepilov was extremely wrong and harmful. They attacked the party's general line last year, but were crushed by the party. Criticism and self-criticism have increasingly great significance. They are extremely important means of discovering and overcoming shortcomings and are also one of the factors in cultivating communist consciousness.

　　Mikoyan said that in the very important issues of our country's economic, state, and cultural construction, the party will continue to consult with the people in the future, and the party believes that this is one of the most important conditions for continuing to advance victoriously.

　　Mikoyan pointed out that the party will soon submit the control figures of the seven-year plan for developing the national economy to the whole people for discussion. He said that we will enter a new stage of development, that is, a stage of further vigorous development of the national productive forces and a rapid advance of our motherland along the road to communism.

　　When Mikoyan talked about the international situation, he said, "The current international situation is determined by two most important factors. On the one hand, imperialism and reactionary forces are trying to undermine peace, create hotbeds of war, put the world in a state of unease and anxiety, and keep it on the brink of war. On the other hand—this is the main aspect—regardless of these attempts by reactionary groups, contemporary international relations are developing in the direction of strengthening the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism."

　　The speaker particularly pointed out that the Moscow meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties held last year was of great significance for uniting communist forces under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and for the struggle for peace and socialism. The unity of the great family of socialist countries has been further consolidated this year.

　　The speaker emphasized the sentence in the "Peace Manifesto": "War is not inevitable, war can be prevented, and peace can be defended and consolidated."

　　Mikoyan said that in the past three years, imperialism has created some hotbeds of war, but war has been stopped by the forces of socialist countries, all peace-loving countries, and peoples.

　　The speaker listed the following hotbeds of war: Britain and France colluding with Israel to invade Egypt; the United States and Britain, with the support of Turkey, plotting to invade Syria; American imperialism and Dutch colonialism, with the support of other colonialist countries that have joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, indirectly invading Indonesia; American and British troops landing in Lebanon and Jordan; and the hotbed of war caused by the United States occupying Taiwan. The speaker pointed out that all of this exposes American imperialism playing the role of world policeman, attempting to dominate the world. However, American imperialism has encountered resistance everywhere from the steel-like determination of peace-loving people of all countries to stop aggression and defend peace.

　　Mikoyan said that Dulles' notorious "position of strength" policy and "brink of war" policy have gone bankrupt. This policy is not only hated by the people of other countries, it not only exacerbates the divisions between the United States and its allies, but also arouses the protests of the American people. Mikoyan said, "The results of the U.S. Congressional and local elections must be seen as an expression of distrust in the Dulles-Eisenhower policy, although the defeated Republicans and the Democrats who won the elections are only two factions of the American bourgeoisie."

　　Mikoyan pointed out that the Soviet Union supports the people of all countries who defend the right to independent development and is willing to help the people of all countries who have freed themselves from the shackles of colonial slavery consolidate their political independence and economic independence. No matter how the form of colonialism changes, the essence of modern colonialism remains unchanged, and that is the brutal exploitation of dependent and semi-dependent countries. The "aid" of Western countries to economically underdeveloped countries is only the imperialist monopoly organizations "giving alms" to the people of the countries they plunder from a very small portion of their profits.

　　The speaker pointed out that the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems has gained increasingly widespread recognition. The Soviet government is taking all measures to prevent the world from going to a devastating war. This year, the Soviet Union has made many important efforts to solve the urgent problem of disarmament. The Soviet government has put forward a series of practical disarmament proposals. He said that we hope to first reach an agreement on the immediate cessation of nuclear tests, and then reach an agreement on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons.

　　Mikoyan emphasized that now is the time to permanently stop nuclear tests and conclude an agreement. He emphasized that only in this way can it be called a success, and only in this way does it mean that the Geneva Three-Nation Conference has not disappointed the hopes of the people of all countries.

　　Mikoyan criticized the delaying tactics adopted by government officials from the United States, Britain, and France towards the Soviet government's proposal to hold a summit conference.

　　Mikoyan continued by saying that friendly and cooperative relations not only exist and are being consolidated between the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp, but also between the Soviet Union and many non-socialist countries on major continents of the world. The Soviet Union has consistently and unswervingly strived to develop economic and cultural ties with all countries in the past and present, and believes that this is an important and reliable way to establish an atmosphere of cooperation and friendship. He said that all socialist countries are following this path.

　　Mikoyan pointed out that the Soviet Union has concluded approximately ninety international agreements on cultural and scientific exchanges with foreign countries, and most of these agreements have been well implemented and are mutually beneficial. But there are many other examples. The speaker pointed out that the British authorities initially expressed their agreement to conclude an agreement on cultural and scientific exchanges, but later came up with tricks to undermine the conclusion of the agreement. It is very obvious that this reflects the general line of the current British Conservative government. The Conservative government is not interested in improving relations with the Soviet Union.

　　Mikoyan emphasized that the Soviet people and our foreign friends are deeply convinced that the resolutions of the Twenty-first Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will open up a new stage for the Soviet Union's communist construction and will arouse a great upsurge in the creativity and initiative of the Soviet people.

　　The speaker finally emphasized that no force in the world can stop mankind from advancing along the road to communism, and our cause is invincible. The balance of power on the world stage has changed forever and irrevocably in favor of socialism.

　　Mikoyan's report was repeatedly interrupted by warm, stormy applause from the audience.

    莫斯科各界劳动人民盛大集会
    庆祝苏联向共产主义挺进
    据新华社莫斯科6日电　莫斯科各界劳动人民庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年大会今天下午五时在列宁运动场体育宫内，在热情高涨的气氛中举行。
    列宁运动场披上了节日的盛装，气象庄严肃穆。体育宫的四周红旗招展，灯火辉煌。体育宫内挂着苏联国徽和苏联十五个加盟共和国的国旗。主席台对面挂着“光荣属于我们亲爱的共产党”的横幅标语。主席台上悬挂着列宁的巨幅画像，并横挂着巨幅的标语：“伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年万岁”。在标语的两旁写有“1917”“1958”几个大字。
    这次大会是由莫斯科市苏维埃和苏联共产党莫斯科市委员会联合主持的。
    出席这次大会的有一万多人。苏联党政领导人伏罗希洛夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫、米高扬、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫等出席了这次大会。参加大会的还有以哥穆尔卡为首的波兰人民共和国代表团、以刘澜涛为首的中国劳动人民观礼团等外国代表团。
    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬在大会上作了关于伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年的报告。
    米高扬在报告中首先着重指出，十月革命给全人类开辟了一条为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的康庄大道。他说，真正的人民政权的昌盛、社会主义民主的发扬、苏联各个自由民族的牢不可破的大家庭、苏联经济力量的空前高涨、现在已经被公认的科学技术和文化艺术的发展、苏联人民物质福利的不断提高——所有这一切都是十月革命的实际果实。
    米高扬指出，现在就是那些不能称作我们朋友的人也承认，苏联人民取得了历史上空前未有的成就。他说，社会主义国家大家庭的形成、社会主义阵营各国所取得的巨大成就是世界上的新的奇迹。
    米高扬说：“苏联人民在共产党的领导下，为建立共产主义的物质和技术基础而胜利地进行斗争。”
    他指出，苏联1958年头十个月的工业生产计划完成了103％以上。苏联工业产品的生产现在为十月革命前俄国的三十六倍。而英国去年的水平只为1913年水平的一点八倍，美国只为四点一倍。
    米高扬说，苏联今年在解决基本经济任务——在按人口平均计算的产品产量上赶上和超过主要的资本主义国家方面迈出了新的重要的一步。
    1958年苏联实现着宏伟的基本建设计划。今年国民经济的基本投资将超过第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划基本投资的总和，超过1957年投资的11％。
    米高扬指出，苏联农业已经获得了巨大的成就。今年苏联是大丰收年，粮食已经采购了约三十五亿普特，大大超过了空前丰收的1956年。今年苏联牛奶的总产量将赶上美国的水平。
    报告人指出，在苏共中央1953年9月全体会议之后苏维埃国家所经历的阶段，实际上以今年的农业生产成果而告结束。过去的这个阶段标志着“我们党的农业总路线的伟大胜利”。
    米高扬接着说，今年是人民物质福利进一步提高的一年。在这一年内苏联的国民收入将增加8％。仅仅今年国民收入的增加额就等于1930年全国国民收入的总额。
    报告人指出，在最近两年内，零售贸易总额增加了20％以上。今年出售的商品（按比较价格计算）将比1940年增加二点七倍。今年为城市居民建筑的住宅总面积将达六千二百多万平方公尺。
    米高扬说，城乡人民群众积极性的高涨，社会主义民主的进一步发扬，党群关系的加强，在很大程度上促进了我国经济发展的成就。
    报告人强调指出，从今年的成就中可以更加清楚地看出，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫和谢皮洛夫反党集团的立场是十分错误的和有害的。他们在去年进攻党的总路线，但是被党粉碎了。批评与自我批评具有越来越大的意义，它是发现和克服缺点的极重要的手段，也是培养共产主义觉悟的因素之一。
    米高扬说，在我国经济、国家和文化建设的十分重大的问题上，党今后还要同人民磋商，党认为这是继续胜利前进的一个最重要的条件。
    米高扬指出，最近党将把发展国民经济七年计划的控制数字提交全民讨论。他说，我们将进入发展的新阶段，即国家生产力进一步蓬勃发展、我们祖国沿着共产主义道路迅速前进的阶段。
    米高扬在谈到国际局势问题时说，“目前国际局势是由两个最重要的因素决定的。一方面，帝国主义和反动势力竭力要破坏和平，制造战争策源地，使世界处于不安和忧虑的状态，保持在战争的边缘上。另一方面，——这是主要的方面，——不顾反动集团的这些企图，当代的国际关系正朝着加强和平、民主和社会主义力量的方向发展。”
    报告人特别指出，去年举行的共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议对于把共产主义力量团结在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，以及对于争取和平、争取社会主义的斗争具有极大的意义。社会主义国家大家庭的团结今年更加巩固了。
    报告人强调指出“和平宣言”中的一句话：“战争不是不可避免的，战争是可以防止的，和平是可以保卫住和巩固起来的”。
    米高扬说，最近三年来，帝国主义制造了一些战争策源地，但是战争却被社会主义国家、所有爱好和平的国家和人民的力量制止住了。
    报告人列举了如下的一些战争策源地：英国和法国伙同以色列侵犯埃及；美国和英国在土耳其的支持下策划侵犯叙利亚；美国帝国主义和荷兰殖民主义在加入北大西洋公约组织的其他殖民主义国家的支持下间接侵略印度尼西亚；美英军队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆；以及由于美国霸占台湾而造成的战争温床。报告人指出，所有这一切暴露了美帝国主义在扮演世界宪兵的角色，企图称霸世界。但是，美帝国主义到处碰到爱好和平的各国人民制止侵略和保卫和平的钢铁般的决心的抵抗。
    米高扬说，杜勒斯的臭名远扬的“实力地位”政策和“战争边缘”政策遭到了破产。这种政策不仅为其他国家人民所憎恨，这种政策不仅加剧了美国同它的盟国的分歧，而且引起了美国人民的抗议。米高扬说，
  “必须把美国国会和地方选举结果看作是对杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔政策不信任的表现，虽然遭到失败的共和党人和在选举中获得胜利的民主党人只不过是美国资产阶级的两个派别而已。”
    米高扬指出，苏联支持捍卫独立发展权利的各国人民，并且愿意帮助摆脱了殖民主义奴隶锁链的各国人民巩固他们的政治独立和经济独立。不管殖民主义的形式如何改变，现代殖民主义的实质仍然是不变的，这就是残酷地剥削附属国和半附属国。西方国家对经济上不发达国家的“援助”，只不过是帝国主义垄断组织把极小一部分利润“施舍”给被它们掠夺的各国人民而已。
    报告人指出，不同社会制度的国家和平共处的列宁主义原则获得了越来越广泛的承认。苏联政府在采取一切措施阻止世界走到毁灭性的战争中去。今年苏联为解决裁军这样一个迫在眉睫的问题作了许多重大的努力。苏联政府提出了一系列切实可行的裁军建议。他说，我们希望首先达成立即停止核试验的协议，然后再达成完全禁止核武器的协议。
    米高扬强调指出，现在应该是永远停止核试验和缔结协定的时候了。他强调说，只有这样才能称得上是成功，也只有这样才意味着日内瓦三国代表会议没有辜负各国人民的希望。
    米高扬指责了美、英、法三国政府人士对苏联政府关于举行政府首脑会议的建议所采取的拖延搪塞的手法。
    米高扬接着说，友好和合作关系不仅在苏联和社会主义阵营其他各国之间存在和巩固，而且在苏联和世界各大洲的许多非社会主义国家之间也存在和巩固。苏联过去和现在始终不渝地努力发展同一切国家之间的经济和文化联系，并认为这是树立合作和友好气氛的重要而可靠的途径。他说，一切社会主义国家都在遵循这种路线。
    米高扬指出，苏联同外国缔结了约九十个关于文化和科学交流的国际协定，这些协定大部分执行得都好，都是互利的。但是还有许多其他例子。报告人指出，英国有关机关最初表示同意缔结关于文化和科学交流的协定，可是后来却想出圈套来破坏协定的缔结。十分明显，这反映了本届英国保守党政府的总路线，保守党政府对改善同苏联的关系并不感到兴趣。
    米高扬强调说，苏联人民和我们的国外朋友深信，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的决议将为苏联的共产主义建设开辟一个新的阶段，将引起苏联人民创造性和积极性的巨大高涨。
    报告人最后强调说，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡人类沿着共产主义道路前进，我们的事业是不可战胜的。世界舞台上的力量对比已经永远地、不可挽回地发生了有利于社会主义的变化。
    米高扬的报告不时为全场热烈的、暴风雨的掌声所打断。
