    Zhejiang's Autumn Harvest Progress Faster Than Last Year
    (By our newspaper) Zhejiang Province's autumn harvest progress has accelerated. Generally speaking for the whole province, the start of the harvest was three to five days later than last year, but the end of the harvest will be about half a month earlier than last year. Currently, the harvest of 19 million mu of late rice, cotton, and ramie has basically concluded, and more than 8 million mu of sweet potatoes, corn, and other late autumn crops have also been harvested by about half.
    This year's autumn harvest has two major characteristics: First, the area is large, the types are many, the yield is high, and the labor demand is great; second, it is advancing side by side with the massive steelmaking and iron smelting movement, while closely linked to the tight schedule and strict standards of winter planting. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the vast number of cadres and people's commune members have brought into play the enormous superiority of the people's communes, making every effort to tap labor potential and adjust labor forces. With the force of a thunderbolt, they have fiercely attacked the planting and harvesting stages, reaching a high-speed record of harvesting 1.34 million mu of late rice in a single day during the peak harvest period in early November.
    The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, at a recent telephone conference, summarized the many experiences created by various localities in the practice of autumn harvest and winter planting into the following points: The first experience is that the Party committee decides, industry and agriculture go hand in hand, leadership divides lines, labor divides industries, closely collaborate, and mutually promote. As of late October, among the province's 697 people's communes, 677 had implemented division of labor and division of industries. This ensures that industry and agriculture are grasped with both hands, and industry and agriculture advance together. The province's more than 10 million laborers have been rationally arranged, with two sets of personnel on the industrial and agricultural fronts, collaborating and promoting each other. Starting in September, more than 3 million laborers were transferred from agricultural positions to the steel front, achieving victory in the intense steel battle. Not long ago, as the prelude to the agricultural autumn harvest and winter planting battle was unveiled, various localities, while continuing to fight well in the steel battle and improve labor efficiency in steel production, transferred approximately 1 million laborers to the autumn harvest and winter planting.
    The second experience is to conduct extensive and in-depth communist education, carry out rectification in the fields, discuss the abstract on the basis of the concrete, set up opposing sides, launch airing of views, debates, and criticisms of various erroneous thoughts, and constantly boost morale. On the agricultural front, various localities have organized extensive discussions among cadres and the masses, launched great airing of views, great debates, compared progress, found reasons, laid out tasks, calculated the season, organized field inspections and on-site visits, so that the advanced become more advanced, and the backward catch up with and surpass the advanced, all focusing on the question of how to carry out the autumn harvest and winter planting at high speed. Some regions, through visiting and learning from regions that have achieved double leaps in steel and agriculture and inspecting agricultural production conditions, have resolved the one-legged walking thinking of some people who said that "engaging in steel is bound to affect agriculture."
    The third experience is to carry out inspections and evaluations, and organize competitions. The Jinhua, Jiande, Jiaxing, Taizhou, Zhoushan, and Wenzhou prefectural committees all organized inspection groups during the autumn harvest and winter planting, and the counties organized branch groups, and the people's communes organized inspection teams. Nearly 500,000 cadres from the province to the production teams participated in the inspection. They lived with the masses, participated in labor, helped solve problems, organized an upsurge in autumn harvest and winter planting, and summarized and promoted advanced experiences, playing a strong role in promoting production. At the same time, various localities organized competitions between teams and teams, communes and communes, counties and counties, and between the industrial front and the agricultural front.
    The fourth experience is to implement collectivized living, militarized organization, and combat-ready action; and on this basis, organize large-scale corps operations, conduct segmented assaults; implement assembly line operations, harvesting, plowing, and planting simultaneously. The obvious effect of the "Three-izations" is to greatly improve the utilization rate of labor and enable large numbers of women to directly participate in production. During the autumn harvest and winter planting, various localities established large corps with the people's commune as the unit, with tremendous power. The large corps is to organize the entire and semi labor force of agricultural production according to the specific situation in a military organization, dividing them into battle lines (front and rear), dividing regions, dividing types of work, and closely coordinating operations. Because the strength of large corps operations is concentrated, each specialty is easy to organize assaults within the scope of division of industries. Many regions, after the rush harvest team completes the autumn harvest of a certain plot of land, the plowing team immediately comes to plow the land, and the planting team comes to sow, implementing assembly line operation methods, so the progress is very rapid.
    The fifth experience is to vigorously grasp tool reform and technological revolution. The characteristic of this work is: let a hundred flowers bloom, not sticking to one pattern. All kinds of power, human, and animal power tools are taken out and put into autumn harvest and winter planting. The province has also promoted nearly 400,000 fast harvesting tools, which are welcomed by the members. Rice threshers have also played a powerful role in the autumn harvest. More than 50,000 sets of rope traction machines promoted throughout the province have greatly improved production progress.
    In addition, implementing the "Five Determinations" (determine the region, time, personnel, quality, effectiveness) for autumn harvest and winter planting; "Three Inspections" (inspect attendance, quality, effectiveness); cadres and the masses eat together, live together, and work together, acting as good "Three Members" (commander, combatant, propagandist); doing a good job in logistics work, doing a good job in collective welfare undertakings, sending meals to the fields, supplying teams to the fields, health workers to the fields, and close cooperation between various departments are also several experiences in accelerating the autumn harvest and winter planting.

    浙江秋收进度比去年加快
    本报讯　浙江省秋收进度加快。就全省范围说，开始收获比去年迟三天到五天，收获结束要比去年早半个月左右。目前，一千九百万亩晚稻、棉花、络麻已经基本收获结束，八百多万亩甘薯、玉米等其他晚秋作物也已收获一半左右。
    今年的秋收有两大特点：一是面积大、种类多、产量高、需工多；一是和声势浩大的炼钢炼铁运动齐头并进，同时紧密地结合着季节紧、规格严的冬种工作。广大干部、人民公社社员在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，发挥了人民公社的巨大优越性，千方百计挖掘劳动潜力，调整劳动队伍，以破竹之势猛攻种、收关，到11月初的旺收时期，达到一天收割晚稻一百三十四万亩的高速纪录。
    中共浙江省委在最近召开的电话会议上，把各地在秋收和冬种的实践中创造的许多经验，归纳为以下几条：第一条经验是党委决定，工农并举，领导分线，劳力分业，密切协作，相互促进。在10月下旬，全省六百九十七个人民公社，已实行分工分业的有六百七十七个。这样，保证了一手抓工业，一手抓农业，工农并举。全省一千多万劳动力作了合理安排，工业农业两条战线，两套人马，相互协作促进。从9月开始，有三百多万劳动力从农业岗位上投入钢铁战线，在紧张的钢铁战役中获得胜利；不久前，农业上的秋收冬种战役序幕揭开，各地又在继续打好钢铁仗、提高钢铁生产劳动效率的同时，抽调约一百万劳动力投入秋收冬种。
    第二个经验是广泛深入进行共产主义教育，进行田头整风，就实论虚，设置对立面，展开鸣放辩论，批判各种错误思想，不断地鼓干劲。在农业战线上，各地都围绕如何高速度进行秋收冬种的问题，组织广大干部、群众进行讨论，开展大鸣大放大辩论，比进度，找原因，摆任务，算季节，组织田间检查和现场参观，使先进的更先进，后进的赶上并超过先进。有些地区通过到钢铁、农业双跃进地区参观学习，检查农业生产情况，解决了某些人所谓“搞钢铁必然影响农业”的一条腿走路思想。
    第三个经验是开展检查评比，组织竞赛。金华、建德、嘉兴、台州、舟山、温州等地委都在秋收冬种期间组织了检查总团，各县组织分团，人民公社组织检查组。从省到生产队参加检查的干部近五十万人。他们和群众生活在一起，参加劳动，帮助解决问题，组织秋收冬种高潮，总结推广先进经验，起了强有力的推动生产的作用。与此同时，各地都组织了队与队、社与社、县与县以及工业战线与农业战线之间的竞赛。
    第四个经验是实行生活集体化，组织军事化，行动战斗化；并在此基础上组织大兵团作战，分段突击；实行流水作业，边收边耕边种。“三化”的显明效果是：大大提高劳动力的利用率，使大批妇女直接参加生产。在秋收冬种中，各地以人民公社为单位成立了大兵团，威力极大。大兵团就是把农业生产的整半劳力按具体情况依军事编制组织起来，分战线（前方和后方），分区域，分工种，密切配合作战。由于大兵团作战力量集中，各专业便于在分业范围内组织突击。许多地区抢收组完成某一丘田的秋收，马上就有耕田组来耕田，种田组来播种，实行流水作业法，因而进度飞快。
    第五个经验是大抓工具改革和技术革命。这一工作的特点是：百花齐放，不拘一格。各种各样的动力、人力、畜力工具都拿出来投入秋收冬种。全省还推广了快速收割器近四十万件，受到社员们的欢迎。打稻机也在秋收中发挥了威力。全省推广的五万多台绳索牵引机，大大提高了生产进度。
    此外，实行秋收冬种的“五定”（定地区、时间、人员、质量、效量）；“三查”（查出勤、质量、效量）；干部和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，当好“三员”（指挥员、战斗员、宣传员）；做好后勤工作，搞好集体福利事业，送饭到田，供应组到田，卫生员到田和各部门密切配合，也是加速秋收冬种中的几条经验。　（李新民）
