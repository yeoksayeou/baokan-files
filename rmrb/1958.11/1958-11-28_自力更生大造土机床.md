    Self-Reliance in Building Indigenous Machine Tools
    Wang Zhanying, Secretary of the Tianjin Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    Beginning in July, Tianjin Prefecture launched a mass movement involving the entire Party and mobilizing the entire population to engage in self-reliance and large-scale machine tool production. After three months of hard work, 4,163 various types of lathes were produced. Although the quality of these lathes is still rough, in terms of quantity, they have increased the region's mechanical equipment tenfold, equipping 165 factories belonging to the prefecture, counties, and communes. This has created conditions for the development of local industry, especially the machinery industry, and laid a material foundation for achieving irrigation mechanization next year.
              
    Necessity Drives Change

    With the great leap forward in agricultural production came a great leap forward in all areas of work, and the development of all areas of work has posed new challenges to industrial development, especially the machinery industry. From the agricultural perspective, achieving even greater leaps forward next year requires first and foremost the mechanization of irrigation. We did the math: Of the region's more than 28 million mu of land, excluding gravity-flow irrigation, 520,000 horsepower of irrigation machinery is needed to basically meet the needs, and we currently only have more than 40,000 horsepower. Although the masses manufactured more than 500,000 pieces of water-lifting equipment during the great leap forward in production last winter and this spring, which played a certain role in drought resistance, it also exposed the contradiction between this equipment and large-scale production. During the driest periods, one waterwheel required three or four laborers working day and night to barely meet the needs of one mu of rice paddy. Therefore, the situation requires us to accelerate the production of drainage and irrigation machinery. In terms of transportation, the entire region has only more than 100 vehicles distributed among the various departments and counties of the prefecture. This year, the entire region planted more than 2 million mu of rice and more than 4 million mu of sweet potatoes. Generally, rice yields are around 1,000 jin per mu, and even more, and sweet potatoes yield more than 3,000 jin per mu. After these crops are harvested, the transportation tasks will be quite arduous, requiring the manufacture of transportation equipment. The Party and the entire population are also engaged in a large-scale steel production movement, which has also posed new tasks for the machinery industry. Other tasks, such as cement production, light industry, the chemical industry, agricultural tool reform, ball bearing production, etc., all require strong support from the machinery industry. What is our foundation like? It can be said that our technology is low, our equipment is scarce, our foundation is weak, and our conditions are poor. The entire region has more than 300 dilapidated lathes. The largest iron factory in Jiahe County has only one lathe. It doesn't even have a powered machine. People have composed a poem to describe this factory: "Blowing machine pulled by a donkey, Eight-foot lathe turned by hand, Twenty-one blacksmiths, Firing the furnace before the Buddha in the ancient temple."
    
    When a diesel engine broke down in Anci County, it had to be transported to Tianjin for repairs, which would take half a year. When it was taken to Shijiazhuang, that factory wouldn't take the job either. It was then taken to Beijing, and it took four months to repair. People resentfully composed a ballad: "Anci County, long from north to south, The factory only has blacksmiths and carpenters, They barely manage to cast pots and forge iron, Repairing machines is a real hassle!"

    The above situation fully illustrates the contradiction between the machinery industry and the current demands of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, and also demonstrates the urgent desire of the broad masses to change this backward situation.
              
    Self-Reliance

    The machinery industry must be quickly equipped. But where do the machine tools come from? After repeated consideration by the prefectural and county Party committees, it was decided to put the task on the table and let the prefecture, counties, townships, and communes universally adopt the methods of big airing, big contending, big debating, and big-character posters to clarify the following issues: (1) Why is it necessary to produce a large number of lathes? (2) Should we rely on asking the higher authorities or buying them from other places, or should we rely on ourselves to build them? (3) How should we manufacture them? Should we focus on "small indigenous groups" or "high-precision large-scale" methods?

    During the discussion of who to rely on, everyone couldn't help but recall the detours they had taken in the past. Because they didn't face the masses and practice self-reliance, they placed their hopes on external assistance. One was to ask the higher authorities, running to the province and the prefecture, and finally to the State Council, refusing to leave, demanding one machine if they couldn't get two, demanding it in the future if they couldn't get it now, causing a lot of trouble for the higher authorities. The other was to purchase everywhere, running all over the major cities of the country, from Chongqing in the south to Qiqihar in the north, and Taiyuan in the west. Some secretaries and county heads personally went out, and some even ordered the procurement personnel, "Don't come back if you don't complete the task." Zeng San, the industry minister dispatched by Jiahe County, went to Shanghai four times, traveling south of the Yangtze River, but returned empty-handed. A few counties did find some, and signed contracts with the factories, but they would not be delivered until the second half of 1959, and they also had to exchange several tons of iron for them. After the debate, the conclusion was reached: "Don't run east or west, the Party's leadership is the guarantee, the wisdom of the masses is boundless, with the leadership and the masses together, there is no fear of thousands of difficulties."

    The idea of self-reliance cannot be established all at once. From the beginning, there was a struggle between two different ideologies. People with conservative ideas emphasized the difficulties of technology, equipment, and raw materials. They said, "You can't produce machine tools without your own machine tools"; "Blacksmiths can only cast pots and plowshares, wanting to build lathes is like a toad wanting to eat swan meat!" People refuted them, saying: "The problem is not determined by the quality of the equipment or the poverty of the family, but mainly by people's thinking. Since the great leap forward in agriculture last winter and this spring, many new-style water-lifting tools have been made. Small agricultural tool factories that could only make straw fences and brooms in the past can now make slicing machines, rice threshers, and harvesters. Since we can make these things now, we can also make lathes."

    The more we debated, the clearer it became. The Jinghai County Iron Factory planned to produce drainage and irrigation machinery last year, but the request for a gantry planer from the prefectural Party committee was not resolved, and as a result, the task of producing drainage and irrigation machinery was not completed. As soon as the production of lathes was proposed, the workers first raised the issue of the gantry planer. Many people felt that they couldn't make lathes without a gantry planer. The county Party committee organized a big debate among the workers on this issue, and asked whether the gantry planer could be made on their own. At that time, the progressives, led by veteran fitter Zhou Jiqing, advocated doing it themselves, reasoning that new products that had never been made before had been successfully made with the leadership of the Party and the wisdom of the workers, and that as long as there was determination, the gantry planer could also be made. But the "hand-raisers" insisted that they couldn't produce a gantry planer without a gantry planer. They argued fiercely and couldn't agree. At this time, worker Wang Shusheng raised a thought-provoking question. He said, "If you can't make a gantry planer without a gantry planer, then how was the world's first gantry planer made?" Through this debate, the workers' thinking was clarified. Once they understood, they started working. In just a few days, the first gantry planer was born.

    Engaging in "Small Indigenous Groups"

    After the idea of self-reliance was established, what kind of approach should be adopted for production? In the beginning, there were also disputes. Many people felt that if we were going to do it, we had to do it properly, with precision and on a large scale. Simple ones were not presentable and wouldn't work. Some even openly stated that they would spare a year and a half to make something outstanding, something that would make people shout a few praises, which would be more like it. When they organized a visit to simple lathes, some technicians said it was nonsense, saying that these things could only make small bearings and had no great future, and that if rabbits could pull carts, who would buy horses. Because of the obstacles of this kind of thinking, progress was very slow in the early stages of production. To address this thinking, various places continued to carry out big debates, asking whether small-scale, indigenous methods, and mass participation were better, or whether large-scale, foreign methods, and a few people doing it were better? Was it better to produce more or less? The result of the debate was unanimous: under the existing conditions, implementing the principles of "first indigenous, then foreign, first small, then large, first simple, then complex, combining indigenous and foreign methods, using indigenous methods to promote foreign methods, and progressing from low to high" was a path to rapid development of the machinery industry.
    
    Once we could manufacture ourselves, difficulties arose one after another when mass production started. These can be summarized into four main aspects: insufficient technical strength; insufficient equipment; insufficient raw materials; and the contradiction between lathe production and the then-current ball bearing production, agricultural tool reform, well cone production, and small blast furnace construction.

    According to conventional methods, making machines requires drawings and making wooden models first. But all parts of the region were producing machine tools, there were not that many drawings, time was tight, and there was not enough time to make drawings on the spot, and more than 90% of the factories in the region had very few people who could read drawings, let alone people who could make drawings. Under these circumstances, what should be done when time did not allow for delay? After mobilizing the masses, the problem was quickly solved. Generally, three methods were adopted in various places: 1. Without drawings, disassemble the existing lathe in the factory and use the various parts as models for sand casting. 2. Copy the shape. After disassembling the machine tool, draw the parts and make wooden models themselves. If there were no patternmakers, use ordinary carpenters. Of course, many problems arose using these two methods. When Jiahe and Nanpi processed parts, they didn't know how many centimeters to turn, and as a result, the parts didn't fit together, some even differing by dozens of centimeters; but the broad masses of workers still continued with full confidence, making, assembling, and modifying as they went along. If it didn't work the first time, they did it twice, three times, or even reworked it more than a dozen times. They did this over and over again, each time more accurate than the last, and finally succeeded. 3. Mutual support. When some factories produced six-foot lathes, they lent the idle four-foot wooden models to other factories for use. When they produced eight-foot lathes, they lent the six-foot wooden models to others. The masses called this method "wooden models visiting each other" or "wooden models visiting relatives." This method solved the difficulties of drawings and wooden models.

    Solving the problem of drawings and wooden models only solved one aspect of the technical problem, while production required people to do it, and having lathes required people to operate them. But where did the large number of technical personnel come from? To solve this problem, three methods were adopted in various places:
    
    1.  Train apprentices in large numbers to increase new technical strength. During the process of vigorously producing machine tools, the entire region increased by about 8,000 people. Generally, the number doubled, and in the most cases, it increased by seven or eight times.
    
    2.  Widely mobilize veteran workers and demobilized soldiers with technical skills. Although these people were older or in poor health, as long as they had some technical skills, we would not give up. We invited them from agricultural cooperatives to the factory, arranged a suitable position for them, and if they could not participate in production, they could guide apprentices in production, trying to give play to their skills.
    
    3.  From all directions, dispatching troops and generals, supporting key areas, and vigorously producing lathes. In cotton ginning factories, flour mills, tractor repair stations, and other enterprises, the technical strength that could be released was uniformly allocated and concentrated in the machinery factory as the backbone.
    
    Making Every Effort to Solve the Raw Material Problem

    The first serious problem encountered in the mass production of lathes was the lack of raw materials. This year, the province did not give us a single jin of gray cast iron. Where do the raw materials for making 4,000 lathes come from? The only way out is to rely on and mobilize the masses. As long as the masses are mobilized, no difficulty cannot be overcome. In line with this spirit, various places adopted the following methods:
    
    1.  Mobilize the broad masses to collect scrap steel and iron, and then pick out gray iron from it. Because the broad masses fully understood the great significance of producing machine tools, they gave great support. The broad masses proposed "Small carts push, shoulder poles carry, scrap steel and iron piled high, to make lathes, turning waste into treasure." Through carrying, shouldering, pushing, and pulling, they collected hundreds of thousands of jin in one day.
    
    2.  Turn white iron into gray iron. In order to solve the problem of gray cast iron, various places spent a lot of effort and paid a great price. Originally, various places used a certain proportion of ferrosilicon to refine white iron into gray iron, or used ferrosilicon and ferromanganese to refine gray cast iron, but because the reserves of ferrosilicon in various places were too small, they were quickly used up. What should we do if the bed surface cast entirely of white iron could not be planed? Everyone was thinking about solving this problem. Li Tingzhen, the old section chief of the Botou July 1st Machinery Factory, went to Baoding to visit and learn the method of using charcoal to refine gray cast iron, but the construction of a large hot-blast furnace required an 80-horsepower power source to drive the blower, which was beyond their means, and the problem was not solved. As a result, after returning to the factory, he still studied on his own and created a method of using lead powder to refine gray cast iron. After four tests, he finally succeeded. In order to refine gray cast iron, Wuqiao County needed to rebuild the hot-blast furnace, but they lacked refractory bricks. They launched a "one jin of pottery shard per household" movement among the masses, and quickly collected more than 6,000 jin, solving the problem of refractory bricks. Botou City transformed the cupola furnace into a simple hot-blast furnace, and also successfully refined gray cast iron. Wuqiao County also ensured that the first furnace refined gray cast iron by increasing the air inlets and reducing the slope of the air ducts.
    
    3.  Use substitutes. There are also several ways: one is to use gray cast iron for the bed surface and white iron for the base, so that the raw materials for one lathe can be used to make two or three lathes. Another is to make the base with cement, or just use cement for the base. The advantage of using cement for the bed frame is that it is strong and durable, saves steel, and greatly reduces the amount of processing. The gantry of the Cangzhen Gantry Planer is also made of cement, and some only have iron tool holders, while the rest are made of cement. Even so, when production was at its most tense, the raw materials still could not meet the needs. Many areas dismantled iron waterwheel frames and waterwheel scoops and replaced them with wooden frames and wooden scoops. These measures solved a big problem.

    自力更生大造土机床
    中共天津地委秘书长　王占瀛
    天津专区从7月份开始，掀起了一个全党动手、全民动员、自力更生、大搞机床生产的群众运动。经过三个月的苦战，制成了各种车床四千一百六十三台，这些车床，虽然质量还很粗糙，但从数量上看，却使全区的机械设备翻了十番，使专、县和公社所属的一百六十五个工厂得到了装备。给地方工业特别是机械工业的发展创造了条件，给明年实现灌溉机械化奠定了物质基础。
              穷则思变
    随着农业生产的大跃进，带来了全面工作的大跃进，而全面工作的发展给工业发展、特别是机械工业的发展，提出了新的课题。从农业方面说，要使明年出现更大跃进，首先是实现灌溉机械化。我们算了个账，全区二千八百多万亩土地，除去自流灌溉以外，必须要有五十二万马力的灌溉机械才能基本上满足需要，而现在我们仅仅有四万多马力。在去冬今春生产大跃进中，群众虽然制造了五十多万件提水工具，在抗旱当中起到了一定的作用，但也暴露了这些工具与大生产不相适应的矛盾。在最干旱期间，一架水车，三、四个劳动力昼夜不停，还满足不了一亩稻田的需要。因此，形势要求我们必须加速生产排灌机械。在交通运输方面，全区仅有一百多辆汽车分布在专区各部门和各县，今年全区种植了二百多万亩水稻，四百多万亩山芋，一般稻子亩产千斤左右，甚至还要多一些，山芋亩产三千斤以上，这些庄稼收割以后，运输任务就相当艰巨，需要制造运输工具。全党全民大搞钢铁运动，也给机械工业提出了新的任务。其他要搞水泥、要搞轻工业、化学工业、农具改造、滚珠轴承等等，都需要机械工业大力支持。我们的底子怎样呢？可以说是：技术低、设备少，基础弱，条件差。全区共有三百多台破旧车床，交河县最大的铁厂，只有一台车床。还没动力机器，人们编了一首诗歌，来形容这个厂子：吹风机器毛驴套，八呎车床用手摇，二十一个黑铁匠，古庙佛前烘炉烧。
    安次县一台柴油机坏了，运到天津修理要等半年，跑到石家庄，那家工厂也不收活，又跑到北京，过了四个月才修好。人们不满地编出歌谣：安次县，南北长，工厂只有铁木匠，铸锅打铁凑合干，修理机器真够呛！
    上述情况充分说明了机械工业与当前工农业大跃进要求不相适应的矛盾，也说明了广大群众改变这种落后局面的迫切要求。
              自力更生
    机械工业，必须很快地装备起来。但机床从那里来？经过地县委反复考虑，决定将任务摆在桌面上，让专县乡社，普遍采取大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的方法，弄清以下问题：（1）为什么要大量生产车床？（2）是依靠向上级要依靠到外地买，还是依靠自己造？（3）怎样制造？以“小土群”为主，还是以“高精大”为主。
    在讨论依靠谁的问题时，大家不由的回忆起以往走过的一段弯路。由于没有面向群众，自力更生，把希望寄托于外援，一是向上级要，向省、向专区跑，最后跑到国务院，赖着不走，两台不行一台，现在不行将来，给上级添了很多麻烦。再就是到处购买，全国各大城市几乎都跑遍了，南到重庆，北到齐齐哈尔，西到太原，有的书记、县长亲自出马，还有的给采购人员下令“完不成任务别回来”，交河县派的工业部长曾三去上海，四下江南，结果徒劳往返，个别县也找到一点，和厂方订了合同，但是要到1959年下半年才能交货，而且还必须拿出几吨铁交换。经过辩论得出了结论：不东跑，不西颠，党的领导是保证，群众智慧大无边，领导、群众在一起，不怕困难有千万。
    自力更生的思想，不是一下子就能树立的。一开始就形成了两种不同思想的斗争，有保守思想的人强调技术、设备、原料的困难。说：“自己没有机床就不能生产机床”；“铁匠只会铸锅倒犁铧，想造车床那是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉！”人们就驳斥他们说：问题不决定设备好坏、家底穷富，主要决定于人们的思想。去冬今春农业大跃进以来，搞了好多的新式提水工具，过去只能造些插笆、扫帚的小农具厂，现在也能造切片机、打稻机和收割机了。既然现在能搞这些东西，也就能够造车床。
    真是越辩越明。静海县铁工厂，去年计划搞排灌机械，向地委要龙门刨没有解决，结果排灌机械生产的任务没有完成，一提出搞车床生产，职工就首先提出了龙门刨的问题，好多人觉得没有龙门刨搞不了车床。县委针对这个问题在职工中组织了大辩论，并提出了龙门刨到底能不能自己造。当时以老钳工周吉庆为首的促进派主张自己搞，理由是过去没作过的新产品，凭着党的领导和工人的智慧搞成了，只要有决心，龙门刨也能造出来。而“伸手派”却坚持没有龙门刨就生产不了龙门刨。针锋相对，争执不下。这时，工人王树生提出了一个发人深思的问题。他说：“如果说没有龙门刨就制不了龙门刨，那么世界上第一台龙门刨是怎样造出来的？”通过这场辩论，职工思想通了。通了就干，没几天，第一台龙门刨诞生了。
          搞“小土群”
    当自力更生的思想树立之后，究竟采取什么样的方针进行生产呢？开始，也曾有过争论。好多人觉得要搞就得搞像样子的，搞精的，大的，简易的不体面，不顶事。有的就公开提出，豁上一年半载，也得搞个出类拔萃的玩艺，拿出来叫人喊上几声好，这才像话。当对简易车床组织了参观后，有些技术人员说这是瞎闹，说这些玩艺只能搞个小轴承，没有大出息，兔子能驾辕谁还买马。因为这种思想的障碍，生产初期，进度很慢。对于这种思想，各地继续开展了大辩论，提出了是小型、土法、群众性好呢，还是大型、洋法、少数人去搞呢？是生产多些好呢？还是少些好呢？辩论的结果，一致认为：按现有条件，贯彻先土后洋，先小后大，先简后繁，土洋并举，以土带洋，由低到高这是快速发展机械工业的一条道路。
    自己能够制造了，但大量生产起来，困难又一个一个地出现了，归纳起来主要是四个方面的问题。即：技术力量不足；设备不足；原料不足；车床生产和当时的滚珠轴承化、农具改革、井锥的生产和小高炉建设有矛盾。
    按照常规，造机器得有图纸，得先制木型。但全区各地都生产机床，图纸没那么多，时间紧，现制图又来不及，而且全区90％以上的厂子，会识图的人也很少，会制图的人更不必说了。在这种情况下怎么办，时间又不允许拖下去。经过发动群众，问题很快就解决了。各地一般采取了三个办法：1、没有图纸，把本厂现有的床子拆开，用各个部件当模型翻砂。2、依葫芦画瓢。机床拆开以后，按部件自己绘图、作木型，没有木型工就用普通木匠。用这两种办法当然也出了好多乱子，交河、南皮加工部件时镟多少厘米也不知道，结果部件搞出来不合牙，有的竟差数十厘米；但广大职工还是信心十足地搞下去，随制、随装、随改，一次不行两次、三次，甚至反工十几次，这样翻来复去的搞，一次比一次准确，最后终于成功。3、相互支援。有些厂子当生产六尺车床时，就把闲起来的四尺木型借给别厂使用，当他生产八尺床子的时候，又把六尺的木型借给别人，群众称这种方法是“木型串门”“木型走亲”。采取这种办法解决了图纸和木型的困难问题。
    解决了图纸和木型问题，仅仅是解决了技术方面的一个问题，而生产需要人来搞，有了床子需要人来操作。但大批的技术力量哪里来。解决这个问题，各地采取了三个办法：
    一、大量培养徒工，增加新的技术力量。在大搞机床生产过程中，全区增加了约八千人左右。一般是增加二倍，最多的达七八倍。
    二、广泛动员老工人和有技术的转业军人，这些人年龄虽大，或者身体不好，只要有点技术，我们总不放弃，从农业社把他们请到厂里来，给他安排个适当的位置，不能参加生产的，可以指导徒弟生产，设法发挥他们的一技之长。
    三、四面八方，调兵遣将，支援重点，大搞车床。在轧花厂、面粉厂、拖拉机修配站等等企业单位，把可以拿出的技术力量进行了统一的调配，集中到机械厂，作为骨干。
    千方百计解决原料问题
    大量生产车床，遇到的第一个严重问题，是原料缺乏。今年省里没有给我们一斤灰口铁，搞四千台床子，原料从哪里来？唯一的出路就是依靠和发动群众，只要把群众发动起来，什么困难也不在话下。各地就本着这条精神，采取了以下几个办法。
    一、发动广大群众，收集废旧钢铁，然后从中再挑拣灰铁。由于广大群众充分了解了生产机床的重大意义，给予了极大支持，广大群众提出“小车推，担子担，废钢废铁堆成山，为了搞车床，废物把身翻。”通过手提、肩担、人推、车拉，一天就搞了十几万斤。
    二、变白铁为灰铁。为了解决灰口铁问题，各地费了不少的心血，付出了很大的力量。原来各地是用一定比例的矽铁炼白铁为灰铁，或用矽铁、锰铁炼灰口铁，但因各地矽铁存量过少，很快就用完了，完全用白铁铸床面不能刨，怎么办呢？人人都在考虑解决这个问题。泊市七一机械厂老工段长李廷臻，曾为此跑到保定去参观，学习人家用木炭炼灰口铁的办法，但要建大型暖风炉，需要有八十马力的动力带动鼓风机，自己条件不足，问题未得解决，结果回厂后还是经过自己钻研，创造了用铅粉炼灰口铁的办法。经过四次试验，终于成功。吴桥县为了炼制灰口铁，需要改建暖风炉，但缺耐火砖，他们发动群众开展了“每户一斤缸瓦面”运动，很快就收集了六千多斤，耐火砖的问题解决了。泊头市将冲天炉改成了简易暖风炉，结果也成功的炼出了灰口铁。吴桥县还通过增加风口，减小风道倾斜度的方法，保证了第一炉就炼出灰口铁。
    三、用代用品代替。也有好几种方法：一种是床面用灰口铁、底座用白铁，这样一台床子的原料可以搞二至三台。再就是用水泥搞底座，或光是底座用水泥，水泥作床身的好处是坚固耐用，节省钢材，大大减少加工量。沧镇龙门刨的龙门也是用水泥做的，也有的仅仅刀架是铁制的，其他都是水泥的。就是这样，到生产最紧张的时候，原料还是不能满足需要，好多地区把铁制水车架子和水车簸箕都拆下来，用木架子和木簸箕代替。这些措施解决了很大问题。
