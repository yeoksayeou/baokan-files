Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 27th: The 1958 National Twenty-Five City Fencing and Gymnastics Championships concluded on the 25th after six days of competition. In the fencing competition, the Beijing team won first place in the overall team score with 42 points. The Wuhan team, whose members are all novices, came in second with 28 points. The Shanghai team scored 10 points, ranking third. Shenyang and Tianjin each scored 3 points, tying for fourth place. The fifth place went to the Xi'an team with 2 points. There was no sixth place in the overall team score because the other teams did not score any points. The team standings for gymnastics were: Nanjing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Chengdu.

Throughout the competition, it was evident that new forces are growing rapidly. Tao Jinhan of the Beijing team and Li Zhixiong of the Xi'an team, who respectively won the national men's foil championship and runner-up in 1957; and Wang Enzhu of the Beijing team and Huo Shiru of the Tianjin team, who respectively won the women's championship and runner-up, were all defeated by rising stars. Chen Suqin and Liu Lingji of the Wuhan team, who had only been learning fencing for three months, unexpectedly won the women's championship and men's runner-up, respectively.

In the épée competition, Guo Yi, a novice from the Wuhan team, was able to win seven consecutive matches in a round-robin competition of nine athletes, taking the championship.

In the entire gymnastics competition, which included single gymnastics, paired strength, mixed doubles, and three-person team events, the rapid progress of gymnastics in China was clearly evident. Although the difficulty of the compulsory movements in some events was higher than last year, the quality of the athletes' performance was very good. Many athletes scored above eight points. The Nanjing team performed the best, winning first place in paired strength, mixed doubles, and three-person team events. It is particularly worth mentioning that many young athletes emerged in this competition. Wu Shoude of Hefei, who is eleven years old, and Yu Zaiqing of Shanghai, who is nine years old, not only completed the compulsory movements very well but also created unexpected results in their optional movements. Wu Shoude's score for the compulsory jump movement was as high as 9.2 points, while Yu Zaiqing scored above eight points in several events. (Attached image)

    二十五城市击剑、技巧运动锦标赛结束
    北京队获击剑第一　南京队获技巧第一
    新华社沈阳27日电　1958年全国二十五城市击剑、技巧运动锦标赛经过六天比赛，已在25日闭幕。在击剑比赛中，北京队以四十二分的成绩获团体总分第一；队员都是新手的武汉队，获得第二名，成绩是二十八分；上海队得十分，名列第三；沈阳、天津各得三分均列第四；第五名是西安队，得二分；团体总分无第六名，因其它各队均未得分。技巧比赛的团体总分名次是：南京、天津、沈阳、上海、重庆、成都。
    在整个比赛过程中，显示出新生力量成长得很快。曾分别获1957年全国轻剑男子冠军、亚军的北京队陶金汉、西安队的李志雄；女子冠军、亚军的北京队王恩珠、天津队霍士儒，都被后起之秀击败。而武汉队的刚学击剑不过三个月的陈素沁和刘凌基，却一跃取得女子冠军、男子亚军。
    在重剑比赛中，武汉队新手郭毅能在九名选手循环角逐时，连胜七场，夺得冠军。
    技巧运动在单人技巧、双人用力、男女混合、三人团体四个项目的整个比赛中，明显地看出了技巧运动在中国迅速进展的面貌。尽管有的项目规定动作难度比去年高，可是运动员完成的质量却很好。很多运动员得分都在八分以上。成绩最好的是南京队，他们夺取了双人用力、男女混合、三人团体等项第一名。特别值得提出的是在这次比赛中出现了不少小将，十一周岁的合肥吴守德和九周岁的上海于在青在比赛中不仅能很好地完成了规定动作，而且在自选动作中也创造了出人意料的成绩。吴守德跳跃规定动作的成绩高达九点二分，而于在青在几个项目的比赛中都在八分以上。（附图片）
