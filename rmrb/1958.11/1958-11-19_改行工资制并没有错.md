    There's Nothing Wrong with Changing to a Wage System
    Jiang Chunze
    One of our Party's wage policies is: gradually improve the people's living standards along with the development of production. Therefore, our wages are raised and increased in a planned way. If we all implemented a supply system, even if the wages were relatively low, we would first have to take care of all the unemployed family members. In reality, that wasn't the case even for veteran cadres in the old liberated areas. We didn't support the children born before they joined the revolution, because their families all had land. After the land reform, the family members all received land. In rural areas, it can be said that there was no unemployment because having labor meant having land. In cities, taking Shanghai as an example, the complete solution to unemployment should be said to be a recent thing; now it can be said that unemployment has been completely eliminated. In addition, the difference between urban and rural life is still very large. If we supported all the family members in the cities but not those in the countryside, wouldn't that promote the influx of rural population into the cities? Also, our labor insurance has this provision: for employees whose family members are in Shanghai, half of the medical expenses are borne by the employee himself, and the other half is borne by the labor insurance unit. At that time, we considered whether this would encourage the influx of rural population into the cities, at least they wouldn't want to go back once they came, because they wouldn't have it anymore once they went back. So, we once considered preparing to cancel it. If we all implemented the supply system, that would mean that regardless of whether you are in Shanghai or not, you should enjoy this treatment, which of course needs to be considered.
    The coexistence of two systems also presents such problems: for those who receive wages, it is actually a kind of mental pressure. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao's article mentioned that some people, after joining the revolution, were willing to receive the supply system, feeling it was glorious, that they were working for the revolution. Does this give wage earners a kind of mental pressure? "You are on a wage system, therefore your relationship with the state is one of employment." He receives the supply system and receives less. Therefore, in our policies, we say that this person is more progressive and that person is more backward. Of course, there are many other complex issues, such as whether all underground party members should be changed to the supply system, and whether the activists in the underground struggle should be changed. In this way, the boundary will be deepened, and many people will want to take the supply system as a sign of progress. In fact, we have heard some young comrades say they would like to take the supply system, feeling that the wage system is not glorious.
    However, as I said earlier, even knowing that there were these complex problems, if we had known in 1955 that the people's communes would appear in just three years, we could have gritted our teeth and resisted no matter what. But at that time, no one anticipated it. Therefore, changing to the wage system cannot be regarded as a "whim" of a few people, but was based on the economic situation and objective conditions at the time.
    In the early days of liberation and even before this rectification campaign, could it be said that workers with communist ideas already accounted for the majority of workers? That they were all as unconcerned about treatment as they are today? It cannot be denied that communist ideas have greatly developed among the workers now, but is it very consolidated? If we regard something that is still in its infancy as a forest, are there some problems? Therefore, even now we cannot completely deny the role of material interests.
    Of course, there are problems with the wage system and the reward system, especially the piece-rate wage system. But even including the piece-rate wage system, it cannot be said that it is promoting bourgeois ideology, nor can we equate the wage system with the feudal hierarchy, nor can we equate the wage system with putting money first.
    The bourgeois legal right viewpoint is different from the feudal hierarchy system, and the principles of our wage system are not completely equal to bourgeois principles either. Distribution according to work reflects the bourgeois legal right viewpoint. But it should be said that this principle has never been realized in capitalist society. The wage system is not equal to putting money first, because the opposite of the wage system is another mode of distribution: the supply system. The conditions for implementing the supply system are extreme material abundance and extreme ideological advancement. Without these conditions, it is impossible to implement the supply system among all working people.

    改行工资制并没有错
    江春泽
    我们党的工资政策有一条：随着生产的发展，逐步改善人民生活。因此，我们的工资是有计划的提高，有计划的增长的。如果都实行供给制，即便工资都比较低，那末首先就得把全部家属失业的人都包下来。实际上，原来供给制的老区干部也不是这样的。在参加革命以前生的孩子我们就没有包，因为他们家里都有地，经过土地改革，家属都分到了地，农村里面可以讲没有失业过，因为有劳动力就有地。而城市里面，拿上海来讲，失业现象的彻底解决应该说是最近的事情，现在可以讲是彻底消灭失业了。另外，城市生活和农村生活差别还很大，如果把城市的家属都包下来，农村的都不包，这样是不是会促进农村人口流入城市？还有，我们劳动保险中有这个规定：职工家属在上海的，医药费由他本人负担一半，还有一半是劳保单位负担，那个时候我们就考虑，这样是不是会鼓励农村人口流入城市，至少来了就不愿意回去，因为一回去就没有了。所以一度考虑准备取消。而全部实行供给制，那就是说不管你是不是在上海，都应当享受这个待遇，这当然就要考虑了。
    两种制度并行，还有这样的问题：对拿工资制的人来讲，实际上是一种精神压力。张春桥同志的文章就提到，有些人参加革命以后，愿意拿供给制，觉得很光荣，这是为革命而工作。这是不是给拿工资的人一种精神压力？“你是工资制，因此你和国家是雇佣关系。”他是拿供给制的，拿得少。因此，我们在政策上就说这个人比较进步，那个人比较落后。当然，还有许多复杂问题，例如地下党员是不是都一律改成供给制，还有地下斗争的积极分子改不改？这样，就会把这个界线加深，很多人要拿供给制作为进步的标志。事实上，我们就听到一些青年同志愿意拿供给制，觉得工资制是不光采的。
    不过我前面已经讲了，即便知道有这些复杂问题，如果1955年知道只有三年就会出现人民公社，我们不管怎样也可以硬着头皮顶住。但是当时谁也没有估计到。所以，改工资制不能看作是少数人的“一念之差”，而是根据当时的经济情况和客观条件的。
    解放初期以至在这次整风以前，能不能说具有共产主义思想的工人在工人当中已经占大多数？都像今天这样不计较待遇？工人中现在共产主义思想大发展，是不能否认的，但是不是很巩固了？如果把还是萌芽的东西就看成森林，是不是有些问题？所以，就是现在我们也还不能完全否认物质利益的作用。
    当然，工资制度、奖励制度有毛病，特别是计件工资制。但是就包括计件工资制在内，也不能说就是宣扬资产阶级思想，不能把工资制跟封建等级制划等号，也不能把工资制和钞票挂帅划等号。
    资产阶级法权观点不同于封建等级制度，而我们的工资制的原则也不是完全等于资产阶级的原则。按劳付酬是有资产阶级法权观点的。可是应该说这个原则在资本主义社会里从来没有实现过。工资制不等于钞票挂帅，因为工资制度的对立面就是另外一种分配方式供给制。要实行供给制的条件是物质极大的丰富，思想极大的提高。不具备这样的条件不可能在全体劳动人民当中实行供给制。
