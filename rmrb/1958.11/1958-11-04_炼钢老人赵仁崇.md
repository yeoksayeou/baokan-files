    Steelmaking Elder Zhao Rencong
    By our reporter Ye Jianyun
    Steelmaking, in most people's minds, is work for young and middle-aged people. Recently, however, we met Zhao Rencong, a 71-year-old steelmaking elder.

    Zhao Rencong is a stirrer worker at the Hongguang Iron and Steel Plant of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Shangcheng County. Indigenous steelmaking, called “stir-frying steel” in Shangcheng, involves smashing indigenous iron ore into pieces and placing them in a furnace, stirring them constantly like roasting chestnuts. Since the indigenous iron ore, during the melting process, adheres to the furnace wall or settles at the bottom, a heavier stirring rod allows for deeper and more thorough stirring. Therefore, a stirring rod typically weighs around thirty pounds. To hold such a heavy iron rod all day long, in front of a scorching furnace, thrusting upward and digging downward, tilting left and lifting right, is indeed quite strenuous work. The hands of a stirrer worker must constantly stir, but the eyes must work even harder than the hands. Experienced people know that you cannot look at the sparks with the naked eye during welding. However, the eyes of a steel stirrer must keep a close watch on the sparkling white molten iron in the furnace. Because the changes in furnace temperature are concentrated in the color of the red-hot iron, only by accurately judging the heat can good steel be produced. This dictates that stirrer workers must not only have strong physical strength but also sharp eyes. In the old society, people here had a saying: “Past fifty-nine, don't be a steel stirrer.” This meant that as one aged, physical strength and eyesight deteriorated, making one unfit for the stirring process.

    When we visited Zhao Rencong, he was operating on a stir-frying furnace named "Satellite." Initially, his face was turned away from us. We only saw a person bending over, with his legs apart, in a horse-riding stance, swaying back and forth. The heavy stirring rod in his hands was as nimble as chopsticks, truly working as he wished, handling freely. While working, he hummed the folk songs popular in this area. We thought to ourselves, this is probably a young strapping lad! Forty minutes later, a furnace of steel was finished. He turned around, and we saw that he was an elderly man.

    Elder Zhao Rencong's body is sturdy, but due to a lifetime of labor, the wrinkles on his face are very deep, and his back is somewhat hunched. When we asked, "Are you tired doing such heavy work at this age?" he gave a thought-provoking answer. He said, "What is tiredness? If a person wants to do something well and has a great determination, he won't think about being tired." He also said that strength comes from food. People are iron, and food is steel. As long as a person can eat, he has strength. Finally, he emphatically said, "There is endless food to eat and inexhaustible strength to use. Wasting strength is a sin!"

    On the surface, these are a few ordinary replies, speaking about general hygiene and common sense. However, upon closer examination, you will discover how lofty an ideal is buried deep within his heart!

    He has a family with many children and grandchildren. Three pairs of sons and daughters-in-law, six grandchildren, and an old unmarried daughter. Eight or nine family members are capable of labor. Logically, at his age, he has no worries about food and clothing. Even if he didn't enter a happiness home, he should let the younger generation work and enjoy a comfortable life at home. His son, Zhao Jiajian, had advised him several times to do nothing, eat three meals a day, and take walks around the house. But he criticized his son, saying: "Young people, you're used to living easy lives. How can you know the suffering the elderly endured in the past?" When he was nine years old, his father died of smallpox next to a landlord's iron-smelting furnace. When he was sixteen years old, his family really had nothing to eat, and his brother led him to work as an apprentice in an iron-smelting workshop run by a landlord. He worked there until liberation, earning only a pair of torn pants. For so many years, he never wore a decent cotton-padded coat in winter. Speaking of today, he excitedly said to his son: "Now, there is oil in the stove and rice in the granary. The clothes are new from the inside out, with summer clothes for summer and winter clothes for winter. People say life is good. Where does this good life come from? Yes, it was brought by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, but if no one uses their hands to work hard, can Chairman Mao pour food into everyone's mouth?"

    Since the great leap forward in steel production, he has told his children and grandchildren: "Our Zhao family has had five generations who have made steel. If you enter the factory, that will be seven generations. This ancestral craft cannot be broken." So, he sent two sons and a grandson to the Hongguang Iron and Steel Plant of the Dongfeng People's Commune. At that time, he also planned to enter the factory himself. Due to the cadres' persuasion, they said that there was currently trouble in the factory and that he should come when they couldn't keep up. Although he didn't come, his heart was still itching.

    A few days ago, the Party put forward the slogan of "indigenous steelmaking, steelmaking by all the people." When the commune leaders were worrying about the lack of technical steelmaking forces, Zhao Rencong carried a quilt and a jar of pickles to the steel plant. As soon as he arrived, he encountered the factory preparing to launch a high-yield steel satellite.

    The Hongguang Iron and Steel Plant has more than two hundred workers. In the past, the entire strength of the plant was focused on ironmaking, and steelmaking had not yet been arranged. The launching of a high-yield steel satellite was a challenge for the commune leaders. The first difficulty encountered was the lack of stirrer workers. Currently, the entire plant is rushing to build twenty-four steelmaking furnaces, and twenty-four furnaces need twenty-four stirrer workers. The entire plant, including part-timers, only has three. Everyone was very happy when Zhao Rencong arrived, but there were still only four. What about the other twenty?

    To overcome this difficulty, the commune Party committee held a stirrer workers' symposium in the factory. At the meeting, the stirrer workers all said: "Lighting all twenty-four furnaces at once, there are too many furnaces and too few people. We can't handle it." Some said, "Let's stir as much as we can. Anyway, we'll do our best!" Zhao Rencong attended this meeting. At first, he didn't say a word. Finally, the other stirrer workers all hoped that Master Zhao would come out and talk about this difficulty. They said, "Master Zhao has been making steel for fifty or sixty years. He knows best whether one person can look after one furnace."

    The old man spoke. Unexpectedly, he spoke of different principles.

    "Yes, in the past, we made steel for landlords and capitalists, and one person only tended one furnace. Because they didn't treat us like human beings, saying that the diggers of furnaces (stirrer workers) were the lowest of the low among the nine streams and three religions." He stretched out his skinny arms and continued, "We were low, but they still drank our blood. Now, who can say that these good days are not our own?" The old man became more and more energetic. Finally, he guaranteed to the Party Committee Secretary Wang Ziming, "Using all my strength, I guarantee to look after fifteen furnaces!"

    The three stirrer workers sitting next to him were both surprised and ashamed. They said: "The old man, who is more than seventy years old, has so much energy. How can we, who are in our thirties and forties, retreat?" One by one, they guaranteed to Secretary Wang: "Learn from Master Zhao, and resolutely complete the task!"

    At 4:00 PM on October 4th, all twenty-four steelmaking furnaces in the Hongguang Plant were lit. As soon as they started, Zhao Rencong led more than twenty young lads and asked them to watch how he operated. At the same time, he taught the young people the basic essentials of each process. When talking about judging the heat, he said: "When the color and shape of the molten iron are stir-fried as white and soft as cotton, it's time to tap the steel." When talking about how to use the stirring rod, he said: "It's the same principle as making porridge. Raw iron, after being burned by the fire, is like pomegranate seeds. Using the stirring rod is to stick the seeds together one by one." This kind of popular analogy is easy for young people to understand. After more than an hour of furnace-side training, eighteen apprentices went to operate the furnaces alone. He walked from one furnace to another, patrolling back and forth. Seeing anything inappropriate, or if others raised questions, he would do it once and explain it.

    At 4:00 AM on October 5th, people had already worked for twelve hours. This was the time for the shift change. The cadres and workers at the furnaces all came to persuade him to go back and rest. He said, "Now is not the time to rest!" At noon, his son, Zhao Jiajian, seeing his father's eyes, which were as red as peaches, came over and said with heartache: "Dad, let me take over for you. Go lie down for a while!" His dad pulled him aside and said: "Child, you're new to this. How can you know the tricks of the furnace? Others can sleep, but your dad can't sleep. If something goes wrong with so many furnaces, how can we face people!"

    At this time, the Party committee issued a notice to each furnace, asking everyone to discuss and solve problems themselves if anything happened, and not to look for Master Zhao, so that he could calm down, close his eyes, and rest for a while. But he still ran from one furnace to another.

    At 4:00 PM on October 5th, the steelmaking satellite of the Hongguang Plant was launched. On this day, the entire plant produced seventy-one tons of steel, and thirty-eight young people learned the steel stirring technology.

    In the evening, at the victory celebration meeting, the entire plant's workers wrote more than a hundred letters of congratulations and commendation to congratulate the old man and thank him for his concern for the young people. The Party committee also sent a pound of white sugar and a box of lotus root powder.

    The old man was moved, and two lines of tears streamed down his face. He said to his sixteen-year-old grandson, Zhao Chengyi: "Child, this is the new society. It's our own steel plant!"

    炼钢老人赵仁崇
    本报记者　叶剑韵
    炼钢，在一般人的印象中，这是青壮年干的活儿。最近，我们却会见了一位七十一岁的炼钢老人赵仁崇。
    赵仁崇是商城县东风人民公社红光钢铁厂的一个炒棍工人。土法炼钢，在商城又叫炒钢，就是把土铁砸碎了，放在炉子里，像炒栗子那样，不断地搅拌。由于土铁在融化过程中，是附着在炉壁或沉淀在炉底的，炒棍重一些，就能够炒得深炒得透。因此，通常一根炒棍都在三十斤左右。一个人，整天拿着这么重的铁棍，在灼热燎烤的炉子前面，上擂下挖，左撇右翘，的确是一件相当吃力的活儿。炒棍工，两只手要不停地搅拌，而一双眼睛哩，比起手来，却要使得更勤快一些。有经验的人都知道，在电焊的时候，是不能用肉眼观看火花的。而炒钢手的眼睛，却必需盯牢炉子里白闪闪的铁水。因为，炉温的变化，是集中在红水的颜色上的，只有火候看得准，才能炼出好钢来。这样，就决定了炒棍工人不仅要有强壮的体力，而且还要有明快的眼睛。在旧社会里，此地人有种说法：人过五十九，别干炒钢手。这就是说，年岁一大，体力差了，目光差了，炒棍这道工序是干不得了。
    我们在访问赵仁崇的时候，他正在一座命名为“卫星”的炒钢炉上操作。起初，他的脸是背着我们的。我们只见一个人弯着腰，岔开八字步子，做着骑马蹬裆式，在来回地摆动着。而那根沉重的炒棍，在他手里，灵活得像筷子一样，真是得手应心，运用自如。他一边干，嘴里还哼着这一带流行的山歌。我们心想，这大概是一个年青的棒小伙子吧！四十分钟以后，一炉钢炒完了，他掉过脸来，一看，才知道这是一位上了年纪的老人。
    赵仁崇老人的身子是结实的，由于劳累了一辈子，面部的皱纹却很深，背有些驼。当我们提出：这大年纪，干这种重活儿累不累的时候，他却做了一个耐人寻味的回答。他说：“什么叫累？一个人想办好一桩事情，决心很大，他就想不到累。”他又说，劲是那来的哩，人是铁，饭是钢，一个人只要能吃饭，他就有劲。最后，他着劲地说：“吃不完的饭，使不完的劲，劲不用就糟踏了！”
    从表面上看，这是几句普通的回话，不过说的是一般生理卫生方面的常识；可是，仔细一推敲，你就会发觉，在他的内心深处，是埋藏着多么崇高的理想啊！
    他有一个儿孙满堂的家庭。三对儿子和媳妇，六个孙儿女，还有个老闺女，全家能劳动的有八、九个。照理，这大年纪，吃穿不愁，即使不进幸福院，也该让小一辈子劳动劳动，自己在家过点舒坦日子了。关于这一点，他儿子赵家俭早劝过他几次了，要他啥事不干，一天吃三顿饭，家前屋后散散心。他却批评自己的儿子说：年青人，顺当日子过惯了，哪里知道老年人过去受的那种罪。他九岁那年，父亲出天花病死在地主的炼铁炉旁。十六岁那年，家里实在没吃的，他哥哥领着他在一家地主办的炼铁作坊里当学徒。一直干到解放，只争得了一条破裤子。这么多年，冬天身上没披过一件像样的棉袄。说到现在，他又兴奋地对他儿子说：“如今，灶头上有油，囤子里有米，衣服从里到外件件是新的，夏有夏衣，冬有冬装，人们都说日子过好了，好日子是哪来的？是的，是共产党毛主席带来的，可是没有人的一双手去忙，使劲干活儿，毛主席能把口粮往每个人的嘴里倒吗？”
    大办钢铁以来，他对他的儿孙们说：我们赵家已经有五代人炼过钢铁，你们进了厂，就是七代人了。这个祖传的手艺，可不能断了。于是，他把两个儿子一个孙子送进了东风人民公社红光钢铁厂。那时候，自己也打算进厂；由于干部们的劝说，说现在厂里有人闹，等赶不赢的时候再来吧。虽没有来，心头依旧是痒痒的。
    几天前，党提出了“土法炼钢，全民炼钢”的口号，公社领导人正在愁缺少炼钢技术力量的时候，赵仁崇背了床被子，拎了一罐子咸菜到钢铁厂来了。他一来，就碰上了厂里在准备放炼钢的大卫星。
    红光炼铁厂有两百多个工人。过去，这个厂的全部力量是放在炼铁方面，炼钢的事还没有来得及安排。放钢的高产卫星，这事却使公社领导人为难起来了。首先碰到的困难就是缺炒棍手。目前，全厂突击，修起了二十四座炼钢炉子，二十四座炉子就得二十四个炒棍手。全厂连半拉子算起来，也只有三个。赵仁崇来了，大家都很高兴，可是也只有四个，还差二十个怎么办哩？
    为了克服这个困难，公社党委会在厂里召开了一次炒棍手座谈会。会上，炒棍手们都说：二十四座炉子一齐生火，炉多人少，搞不赢。有的说，能炒多少就炒多少吧，反正是尽力而为嘛！赵仁崇参加了这个会，开始，他一句话没说，最后，其他的炒棍手都希望赵老师傅出来讲讲这个困难了。他们说：“赵老师傅炼了五、六十年的钢铁，能不能一个人看一个炉子，他是知道得最清楚的。”
    老人说话了。不料，他说的却是另外的道理。
    “是的，在过去，咱们给地主和资本家炒钢，一个人只顶一个炉子。因为，他们把咱不当人，说搞地炉子的（炒棍手）是九流三教中最下流的贱坯子。”他伸出了瘦骨嶙嶙的膀子接着说：“是下流，可是下流人的血却叫他们给喝了。如今啊，谁能说好日子不是咱们自己的。”老人越说越上劲，最后，他向党委书记王子明保证说：“拿出浑身的力气，咱一人保证看好十五座炉子！”
    坐在他旁边的三个炒棍手又是惊奇又是惭愧。他们说：人家七十多岁的老人拿出这么大的干劲，难道咱们三、四十岁的人，还打退堂鼓。他们一个个向王书记保证：向赵老师傅学习，坚决完成任务！
    10月4日下午四点，红光厂的二十四座炼钢炉全点火了。一上来，赵仁崇领了二十多个棒小伙子，要他们观看一下他是怎么操作的。同时，他把各个工序的基本要领，向青年人传授。当讲到看火候的时候他就说：当铁水的颜色和形状炒得像棉花一样雪白绵软的时候，这就好出钢了。在讲到使炒棍的方法时就说：这和做稀饭的理路是一样；生铁，经火一烧，像石榴子一样，使炒棍，就是把一粒粒的粘在一起。这种通俗的比喻，青年人很容易懂，经过一个多钟头的炉前培训，有十八个学徒到炉子上单独操作去了，他就从这个炉子走到那个炉子，来去巡回。看到不妥当的地方，或是别人提出问题来，他就做一遍，讲一下。
    10月5日上午四点，人们已经工作过十二个小时了，这是换班的时候，干部们和炉子上的工人都来劝他回去休息一下。他说：“现在不是休息的时刻！“中午，他儿子赵家俭看到父亲那副熬得像红桃子一样的眼睛，走过来心痛地说：“爹，我替你，去躺一会儿吧！”他爹把他拉在一边说：“孩子，你初出茅庐，哪里知道这炉子上的门道。人家能睡，你爹可不能睡呀。这么多炉子，要是出点毛病，咱怎对得起人！”
    这时，党委给各个炉子下了通知，要大家在有事的时候自己商量解决，不要去找赵师傅，好让他安静下来闭上眼睛休息一会。可是他仍旧从这个炉子跑到那个炉子。
    5日下午四时，红光厂的炼钢卫星放出来了。这一天，全厂出了七十一吨钢，有三十八个年轻人，学会了炒钢的技术。
    晚上，在祝捷大会上，全厂职工写了一百多封慰问信、表扬信来祝贺老人，感谢他对年青人的关怀，党委也送来了一斤白糖一盒藕粉。
    老人感动了，脸上挂下了两行热泪。他对十六岁的孙子赵成益说：“孩子，这就是新社会，是咱自己的炼钢厂！”
