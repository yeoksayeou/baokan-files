    When the Soviet Union Offers Disinterested Assistance
    Yi Yi
    The Soviet Union's decision to loan 400 million rubles to the United Arab Republic to help build the Aswan High Dam has been warmly welcomed by the Arab people, but it has caused shock and outrage in Washington. The Associated Press said, "This is a turning point on the African continent." Wall Street sources believe it is "a major blow to American power in the Middle East." What followed was a series of vicious slanders against the Soviet Union, saying that it showed "the Soviet Union has completed a bloodless coup in Africa," and was "the greatest victory for the gradual economic penetration of the Middle East," and so on.
    Why are the American masters so furious? Of course, all the slanders are groundless, because the Soviet loan is disinterested and does not come with any political conditions. Marshal Amer, Vice President of the UAR, who went to the Soviet Union for negotiations, pointed out this point, and he said enthusiastically: "Small countries have friends, and they have a reliance in their struggle for independence." In fact, the one who really wants to carry out "economic penetration" and a "bloodless coup" is the United States itself. The "Wall Street Journal" also admitted that the United States initially promised a loan and then withdrew it "for political purposes." The real reason why the American ruling group is angry about the Soviet loan is that this political trick they played has completely failed.
    In this case, Dulles had to appear. On the one hand, he tried his best to put on a nonchalant look, saying that he did not think this was something to be alarmed about; on the other hand, he deliberately belittled the great significance of the Soviet Union's disinterested assistance, saying that 400 million rubles was not a large sum, and that the "economic value" of the Soviet loan in "actual dam construction" could only be "answered in the future."
    After the rage, followed by vicious slander, and finally a roundabout declaration that "the grapes are sour," and also questioned whether "grapes" even existed. This is the best portrayal of the face of American imperialism.
    Dulles did not stop there. He expressed that the United States is willing to participate in the so-called "regional development organization" in the Middle East to "help build" the Aswan Dam project. It turns out that Dulles is eager to get involved! As for the conditions? Dulles only proposed that Arab countries accept the establishment of a "regional development organization," instead of proposing the naked enslavement and insulting conditions that have been proposed for years. However, the Arab people will not fail to see that handing over the construction project to the "regional development organization" is no different from handing it over to the mastermind behind the organization, the United States. That is why Dulles had to be a little smarter and say that "it is too early to say whether Arab countries want such an organization now."
  Dulles can no longer show off or exert pressure on the Aswan Dam project. The Cairo "Al-Akhbar" wrote: When Dulles announced the withdrawal of the loan proposal, he secretly rejoiced that he had achieved great success, but today the whole world is laughing at Dulles's stupidity. His idea fell through. The newspaper proudly said: "The United Arab Republic, with the help of its friends, can continue to implement this plan without a millieme (Egyptian currency) from Washington or London." Indeed, what makes Dulles even more embarrassed is that the UAR government has announced that the project is about to begin. Facts will ruthlessly answer Dulles's question: How much "economic value" will true friendship produce?

    当苏联提出无私援助的时候
    一易
    苏联贷款四亿卢布援助阿拉伯联合共和国建筑阿斯旺高水坝的决定，受到了阿拉伯人民的热情欢迎，但是华盛顿却引起了一片震惊和恼怒。美联社说，“这是非洲大陆上一个转折点”。华尔街人士认为这是“对美国在中东势力的一个重大打击”。接着而来的便是对苏联发出一连串的恶毒污蔑，说什么这是表明“苏联已经在非洲完成了一次不流血的政变”啦，是“对中东进行的逐步经济渗透的最大胜利”啦等等。
    为什么美国老爷们会这样暴跳如雷呢？当然一切污蔑都是毫无根据的，因为苏联的贷款是无私的，不附带任何政治条件的。赴苏谈判的阿联副总统阿密尔元帅就指出了这一点，他热情地说：“弱小国家有朋友了，它们在争取独立的斗争中有了依靠”。事实上，真正一心想要进行“经济渗透”、“不流血政变”的恰恰是美国自己。“华尔街日报”也承认，美国最初答应贷款，然后又收回，都是“为了政治目的”。美国统治集团恼恨苏联贷款的真正原因，就是由于他们玩弄的这一套政治戏法彻底破产了。
    在这种情况下，杜勒斯是少不得要出场的。他一面尽力摆出一副若无其事的样子，说他不认为这是值得大惊小怪的事；一面故意贬低苏联这一无私援助的重大意义，说什么四亿卢布不是个大数目，苏联贷款在“实际建设水坝方面的经济价值”，只有在“未来才能回答”。
    暴跳如雷之后，继之以恶毒污蔑，最后则转弯抹角地宣布“葡萄是酸的”，而且对是否存在“葡萄”也提出了疑问。这就是美帝国主义面目最好的写照。
    杜勒斯并没有到此为止，他表示美国愿意在中东参加所谓“区域性发展组织”，“帮助建设”阿斯旺水坝工程。原来，杜勒斯是要急于插上一手啊！至于条件呢？杜勒斯只提出要阿拉伯国家接受成立“区域性发展组织”，而不是像几年来那样一连提出露骨的奴役性和侮辱性的条件。但是，阿拉伯人民不会看不到，把建设工程交由“区域性发展组织”控制，和交给这个组织的幕后主人美国没有什么不同。这就是为什么杜勒斯不得不放聪明一点，说“现在要说阿拉伯国家是否要这样一个组织，为时还太早”。
  杜勒斯再也不能在阿斯旺水坝工程上逞威风、施压力了。开罗“消息报”写道：当杜勒斯宣布收回贷款建议时，曾暗暗自喜地以为他已取得了很大成功，但今天全世界都在嘲笑杜勒斯的愚蠢。他的想法落了空。这家报纸自豪地说：“阿拉伯联合共和国在他的朋友们的援助下，能够不要华盛顿或者伦敦的一个米利姆（埃及币名）而继续实施这项计划”。的确，使杜勒斯更难堪的是，阿联政府已宣布工程就要开始了。事实会无情地回答杜勒斯的问题：真正的友谊究竟会产生多大的“经济价值”。
