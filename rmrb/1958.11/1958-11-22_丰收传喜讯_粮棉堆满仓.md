    Good News of a Bumper Harvest: Granaries Full of Grain and Cotton
    (Reported by our newspaper) The autumn harvest for this year has already concluded in various parts of northern Korea. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions are reporting joyful news of an unprecedented bumper harvest.
    Thanks to the correct agricultural policies implemented by the Korean Workers' Party, the vigorous cultivation of cold-bed seedlings, and the extensive establishment of irrigation systems for dry and paddy fields, the grain output in northern Korea this year will reach 3.9 million tons, an increase of 700,000 tons compared to last year. This represents the fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan targets three years ahead of schedule.
    The rice yield of agricultural cooperatives in various regions has greatly improved. The Chollima Agricultural Cooperative in North Pyongan Province obtained an average of 18 tons of rice per chongbo (approximately 15 mu) on 40 chongbo of paddy fields. The average rice yield per chongbo in many agricultural cooperatives has increased by 0.5 to 1 times.
    This year's dryland crops also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. One agricultural cooperative in Sunan County, South Pyongan Province, achieved an average corn yield of 39 tons per chongbo.

    丰收传喜讯　粮棉堆满仓
    本报讯　朝鲜北部各地已经结束了今年度的秋收。各地农业社，传来了空前丰收的喜报。
    由于朝鲜劳动党实施了正确的农业政策，大力培植了冷床苗，广泛地建立了旱田和水田的灌溉系统，今年朝鲜北部的谷物产量将达到三百九十万吨，比去年增加七十万吨，提前三年超额完成了五年计划规定的指标。
    各地农业社的稻产量，有了很大的提高。平安北道前进农业社，在四十町步（每町步约为十五市亩）水田上获得了每町步平均十八吨稻子。很多农业社的每町步平均稻子产量增加了零点五至一倍。
    今年旱田农作物也获得了空前的丰产。平安南道顺安郡一农业社，每町步平均玉米产量达到三十九吨。两江道厚昌郡常德农业社，每町步平均马铃薯产量达到了一百八十吨。
    棉花生产也获得了大丰收，估计全国棉花产量将有六万多吨。（附图片）
