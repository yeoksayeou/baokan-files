Xinhua News Agency: Inner Mongolia and Northwest China will comprehensively launch desert management work next year. The specific guiding principles and planning program (draft) for desert management were recently formulated at the Six Provinces (Regions) Desert Management Planning Conference held in Hohhot. The conference decided to launch a large-scale march towards the deserts starting next year, turning the vast desert into an oasis, becoming a forestry and animal husbandry base, and benefiting the people.

    This conference was jointly convened by the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, the Seventh Office of the State Council, and the Science Planning Commission of the State Council, based on the instructions of the Party Central Committee. The conference started on October 27 and ended on November 2.

    The conference stipulated that the general guiding principles for desert management work are: the whole party takes action, the whole people are mobilized, overall planning, comprehensive management, adapting to local conditions, and establishing defenses according to the harm; combining universal management with key management, combining desert transformation with desert utilization, combining biological measures with engineering measures, and combining large-scale afforestation and grass planting with the protection and consolidation of existing vegetation. The desert management planning program (draft) pointed out that the basic method of transforming deserts is the biological measure of afforestation and grass cultivation, but it must have certain water conservancy conditions to ensure the accelerated growth and development of plants in the sandy land. The principle of water conservancy development should be the combination of surface water, groundwater, and precipitation, combining near and far, and combining large, medium, and small projects. While fully mobilizing the masses to march towards the desert, we must also attach importance to the application of aerial seeding, mechanical well drilling, and modern science and technology. The program puts forward specific requirements for scientific research, water conservancy, transportation, and other aspects.

    The conference pointed out that there must be strong ideological leadership in desert management work. First of all, we must fully carry out ideological mobilization so that the broad masses of people deeply realize the great political and economic significance of transforming the 1.6 billion mu of desert, and understand that as long as we have the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, relying on the Party and relying on the masses, the desert can be completely conquered. The conference required that all localities, in conjunction with the socialist and communist education movement this winter and next spring, carry out a large-scale publicity and education campaign on desert management work in rural and pastoral areas, and launch a great debate among the masses to improve understanding and strengthen confidence.

    The conference emphasized that in desert management work, we must strengthen communist large-scale cooperation between provinces, counties, and communes; we must achieve unified planning, division of responsibilities, mutual communication of information, and exchange of experience. At present, we must especially carry out large-scale cooperation in terms of labor and grass seeds. (Attached picture)

    造林育草变沙漠为绿洲
    内蒙和西北将大规模治理沙漠
    据新华社讯　我国内蒙古和西北地区明年将全面展开治理沙漠的工作。治沙的具体方针和规划方案（草案）最近在呼和浩特市召开的六省（区）治沙规划会议上制定。会议确定从明年开始向沙漠大进军，使万里黄沙变为绿洲，成为林业和牧业基地，为人民造福。
    这次会议是根据党中央的指示，由中共中央农村工作部、国务院第七办公室和国务院科学规划委员会联合召开的。会议从10月27日开始到11月2日结束。
    会议规定治沙工作的总方针是：全党动手，全民动员，全面规划，综合治理，因地制宜，因害设防；普遍治理与重点治理相结合，改造沙漠与利用沙漠相结合，生物措施与工程措施相结合，大量造林植草与保护巩固现有植被相结合。治沙规划方案（草案）指出：改造沙漠的基本方法是造林育草的生物措施，但必须具备一定的水利条件，才能保证加速沙地草木的生长发育。水利开发的原则应当是，地面水、地下水和降水三者相结合，远近结合，大、中、小相结合。在全面发动群众向沙漠进军的同时，还必须重视飞机播种、机械凿井和现代科学技术的应用。方案对科学研究、水利、交通等方面都提出了具体要求。
    会议指出，在治沙工作中要有坚强的思想领导。首先要充分作好思想发动，使广大群众深刻地认识到改造十六亿亩沙漠在政治上和经济上的重大意义，了解到只要我们有敢想敢干的共产主义风格，依靠党，依靠群众，沙漠是完全可以征服的。会议要求各地结合今冬明春的社会主义和共产主义教育运动，在农村、牧区中开展一次声势浩大的关于治沙工作的宣传教育工作，在群众中展开大鸣大放大辩论，以提高认识，坚定信心。
    会议强调在治沙工作中要加强省与省、县与县、公社与公社之间的共产主义大协作；要做到统一规划，分工负责，互通情报，交流经验。目前特别要在劳动力和草木种子方面进行大协作。（附图片）
