    Victory in Sight, Ambition Forward

    After the great victory in October, the fighters on the steel front continued to advance, achieving another 789,000 tons of steel in the first ten days of November, bringing the national steel production to over 8 million tons this year. This new record is very significant. It shows that after the high-yield steel week in late October, the quantity of steel not only did not decrease but steadily increased, advancing step by step. The target of 10.7 million tons of steel is getting closer and closer to us.

    However, for us Communists, we must not be intoxicated with victory at any time. It seems that there is no major problem in achieving 10.7 million tons of steel this year, but after all, only 8 million tons have been produced so far, and there are still over 2 million tons to go, so we cannot think that everything is fine. Moreover, we have always been in the habit of completing the tasks set by the Party ahead of schedule. We cannot wait until December 31st to reach 10.7 million tons of steel. This is the first point.

    There is also a very important point: the overall plan is indeed being completed very well, but it does not mean that every enterprise is completing it well. Especially for those key steel enterprises, if any of them fail to complete the state plan by even 1%, the loss will be great. Therefore, we place great hope on every steel enterprise, especially the key steel enterprises. We hope that those steel enterprises that have not done well in completing their tasks will further and more thoroughly mobilize the masses in the last forty-odd days of this year, work hard, and never give up until the goal is achieved.

    The above only discusses the issue of quantity. As for the quality of steel, turning steel into materials, there are still several hurdles to overcome, and we cannot be complacent. I will not elaborate on this here.

    胜利在握　雄心向前
    钢铁战线上的战士在10月大胜以后，继续挥师前进，在11月的头十天，又拿到了七十八万九千吨钢，使得今年全国的钢产量突破了八百万吨的大关。这个新纪录是很有意义的，它说明在10月下旬的钢铁高产周以后，钢的数量不仅没有下降，而且稳步上升，节节向前，一千零七十万吨钢的目标，已经离我们越来越近了。
    然而对我们共产党人来说，任何时候都不能陶醉在胜利里。看起来，今年拿到一千零七十万吨钢是没有多大问题了，可是毕竟到现在为止还只有八百万吨，还有两百几十万吨没有到手，因而不能认为万事大吉。何况对于党所提出的任务，我们历来的习惯都是要提前完成的，总不能到12月31日才拿到一千零七十万吨钢，这是一。
    还有很重要的一点：总的计划确是完成得很好，但是不等于每个企业都完成得很好，特别是那些重点钢铁企业，如果它们中有哪一个那怕只少完成国家计划1％，损失都是很大的。所以我们对于每一个钢铁企业，特别是对重点钢铁企业，寄予极大的企望。希望那些完成任务不算好的钢铁企业，在这一年最后的四十多天中，要更深更透地发动群众，大干一番，不达目标，绝不罢休。
    上面只是谈的数量问题，至于钢铁的质量，把钢变成材，还有几关未过，更不能高枕无忧，这里就不多说了。
