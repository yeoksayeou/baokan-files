    "To Each According to His Work" is Not Bourgeois Right
    Chi Xichao
    "To each according to his work" is the socialist principle of distribution. This principle can only be truly realized after the elimination of classes and exploitation. In socialist society, every worker can obtain consumer goods equal to his labor (excluding the labor he contributes to social funds); he gives a certain amount of labor to society in one form and takes it all back in another form. This is fundamentally different from the bourgeois society's seemingly "equal" and "equivalent exchange," which in reality conceals a distribution system of class exploitation. There is no exploitation or class interest here. If there is any interest, it is only in favor of the working people, safeguarding the rights of workers not to be exploited. As for those exploiting classes who "reap without sowing," it is only "he who does not work, neither shall he eat." As mentioned above, I believe that the principle of distribution "to each according to his work" is not a manifestation of bourgeois right. If we say there is such a right, it is only the right of the working people, because it protects the right of the working people not to be exploited.
    Of course, the principle of "to each according to his work" does not yet conform to the true equality that we communists pursue. Lenin said: "Strictly speaking, communism means working for society without compensation, without considering the differences between individuals, without the slightest old viewpoint, without conservatism, old habits, differences between work departments, and differences in labor remuneration, etc." This means that our Marxist view of equality is that everyone has the equal obligation to work according to their ability, and all laborers have the equal right to each according to their needs.
    The principle of "to each according to his work" cannot satisfy our demands. Because here, the rights of workers are calculated according to the labor they perform; those who labor more receive more, and those who labor less receive less. Because each person's physical and intellectual strength is different, the labor contributed in the same amount of time is also different. Therefore, the rights obtained are also different. Even for those who perform the same labor and receive the same income, the rights actually obtained by each person still differ due to differences in whether they are married, and the number of children they have. It can be seen that although "to each according to his work" can protect the working people from being exploited, it cannot protect the true equality of each individual within the working people in enjoying rights. Precisely for this reason, we say that the equal rights embodied in the principle of "to each according to his work" are limited. And only because of this, Marx believed in "Critique of the Gotha Program" that: "In principle, it is still bourgeois right." It should be noted that Marx only said here: "In principle, it is still bourgeois right," and did not say: "This is bourgeois right." Lenin called it "the narrow view of bourgeois right" or "bourgeois right" in "State and Revolution." The "bourgeois right" mentioned here can only be understood in this sense, just as Lenin said in the same book: "Under communism, for a certain period of time (socialist society), not only does bourgeois right remain, but even a bourgeois state without the bourgeoisie remains." The "bourgeois right" mentioned here is essentially just a bourgeois right that does not protect the interests of the bourgeoisie. This is fundamentally different from bourgeois right itself, which protects the interests of the bourgeoisie. Without distinguishing this point, discussing this issue abstractly and generally can easily lead to erroneous conclusions.
    Some people do not delve into the essence of things, and only understand it literally, mistakenly equating what Lenin called "bourgeois right" here (that is, what Marx said is still bourgeois right in principle) with the bourgeois right that truly protects the interests of the bourgeoisie. Some people also mistakenly believe that because others call this phenomenon a "remnant of bourgeois right," the "remnant" is only a part of the whole, and it only differs from the body of bourgeois right in quantity, not in quality. These views are completely wrong.
    According to the Marxist view of rights, I believe that the "to each according to his work" system is not the right of the bourgeoisie, but the right of the working people, the will of the working people elevated to law, and the interests of the working people embodied through state law. It is determined by the socialist economic system and is the superstructure of socialist society. If we only consider that "to each according to his work" cannot eliminate the inequality of people's actual enjoyment of rights, we can also call it the "remnant of bourgeois right" or what Marx said is "in principle still bourgeois right," Lenin's "narrow view of bourgeois right," and "bourgeois right" that does not protect the interests of the bourgeoisie.
    Here, the main issue is substance, not name.

    “按劳取酬”不是资产阶级法权
    池曦朝
    “按劳取酬”是社会主义的分配原则。这个原则只有在消灭了阶级和剥削以后才能真正实现。在社会主义社会，每个劳动者能够取得与自己的劳动相等的消费品（这里要除去他为社会基金所付出的劳动）；他以一种形态给予社会一定的劳动量，而以另一种形态全部取回来，这和资产阶级社会佯似“平等”和“等价交换”，而实则隐藏着阶级剥削的分配制度有本质区别。这里没有剥削，也没有阶级利益。如果说有利益的话，也只有对劳动人民有利，维护劳动者不被剥削的权利，而对于那些“不劳而获”的剥削阶级，那就只有“不劳动者不得食”了。如上所述，我认为“按劳取酬”的分配原则并不是资产阶级法权的表现。如果我们认为有法权的话，那也只是劳动人民的法权，因为它维护的是劳动人民不被剥削的权利。
    当然，“按劳取酬”原则和我们共产主义者所追求的真正平等还是不相符合的。列宁说：“所谓共产主义，严格说来就是无代价地为社会工作，不考虑每个人的差别，丝毫没有旧的观点，没有守旧心理、旧习气、各工作部门间的差别以及劳动报酬上的不同，等等。”这也就是说，我们马克思主义者的平等观，就是每个人都有按各人能力劳动的平等义务，一切劳动者都有各取所需的平等权利。
    “按劳取酬”原则并不能满足我们这样的要求。因为在这里，劳动者的权利是按照其所从事的劳动来计算的，劳动多的得到的也多，劳动少的得到的也少。由于每个人的体力、智力不同，在同一时间内所贡献的劳动就也不同。因此，得到的权利也有所差别。就是劳动相同，收入相等的人，也由于各人结婚与否，子女多少的不同，使得每个人实际上所获得的权利仍然有所差别。可见，“按劳取酬”虽然能够维护劳动人民的不被剥削，但不能够维护劳动人民内部每个人享受权利的真正平等。正因为这样，我们说“按劳取酬”原则所体现的平等权利是有一定的限制的。也仅仅因为这样，马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中认为：“在原则上仍然是资产阶级式的法权”。应该注意，马克思在这里仅仅只是说：“在原则上仍然是资产阶级式的法权”，而没有说：“这就是资产阶级法权”。列宁在“国家与革命”中称它为“资产阶级法权的狭隘观点”或“资产阶级法权”。这里所说的“资产阶级法权”，仅仅只能在这个意义上来理解，就像列宁在同书中所说的：“在共产主义下，在一定的时期内（社会主义社会），不仅保留资产阶级的法权，甚至还保留没有资产阶级的资产阶级国家”一样。这里所说的“资产阶级法权”，实质上也只是一个不维护资产阶级利益的资产阶级法权。这和维护资产阶级利益的资产阶级法权本身是有本质区别的。不分清这一点，抽象、笼统地来谈这个问题，就容易得出错误的结论。
    有些人不深入研究事物的本质，仅从字面上来理解，错误地将列宁在这里所谓的“资产阶级法权”（也就是马克思说的在原则上仍然是资产阶级式的法权）和那真正维护资产阶级利益的资产阶级法权混同起来。也有些人因为别人将这种现象叫做“资产阶级法权的残余”，就错误地认为“残余”只是整体的一部分，它和资产阶级法权本体只是量的不同，没有质的差别。这些看法是完全错误的。
    根据马克思主义的法权观点，我以为“按劳取酬”制并不是资产阶级的法权，而是劳动人民的法权，是被提升为法律的劳动人民的意志，是通过国家法律体现出来的劳动人民的利益。它由社会主义经济制度所决定，是社会主义社会的上层建筑。如果仅就“按劳取酬”不能消除人们实际获得权利的不平等这点而论，我们也可以称它为“资产阶级法权的残余”或马克思说的“在原则上仍然是资产阶级式的法权”，列宁说的“资产阶级法权的狭隘观点”以及不维护资产阶级利益的“资产阶级法权”。
    在这里，主要的问题是实质而不是名义。
