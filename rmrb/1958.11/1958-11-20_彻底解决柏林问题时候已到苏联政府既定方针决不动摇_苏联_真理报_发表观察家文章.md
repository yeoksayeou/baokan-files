Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 18th: The "Pravda" published an observer article today, pointing out that the Soviet government has decided to unwaveringly implement the long-planned measures to end the remnants of the occupation regime in Berlin.

The article said: "If the leaders of the Western countries, who stubbornly cling to the occupation status in Berlin, believe that to implement the Soviet government's established measures, they must obtain some kind of consent from the Western countries, then they are greatly mistaken. No such consent is needed at all. The Soviet Union will resolutely implement this policy and will definitely achieve this policy."

The article, entitled "The Only Solution to the Berlin Problem," wrote that the time has come to thoroughly resolve the Berlin problem to consolidate peace and international security. The Western countries themselves have lost any legal and moral right to maintain the occupation regime in West Berlin. The four-power occupation status in Berlin has practically ceased to exist long ago. There are two sovereign states in Germany, and all excuses for the occupation status have long lost their meaning. The Western countries have artificially created a situation in Berlin that violates legality and reason, attempting to achieve their goal of illegally stationing troops in Berlin, establishing bases there to carry out subversive activities against the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries. This situation is intolerable.

The article continued, the Western countries are groundlessly and meaninglessly attempting to invoke certain obligations in the occupation regime stipulated in the early years after the war to justify their policies. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles is now talking about the "solemn obligations to control West Berlin." But in Potsdam, all those devastated by the war swore not to allow fascism and militarism to revive on German soil, have American politicians forgotten this solemn oath? They deliberately violated this oath and trampled on the Potsdam Agreement. The article said: "It is precisely due to the policies of the Western countries, especially the United States, that West Germany is developing along the path of reviving militarism and revanchism, along the path of dragging West Germany into the NATO aggressive bloc."

The article said that some people in the West are now creating a military frenzy around the Berlin issue, and it seems that they want to shake the Soviet Union's decision made out of concern for peace in Europe and the national interests of all the German people. But this approach is not applicable in dealing with relations with the Soviet Union. Eliminating the remnants of the occupation regime in the capital of the German Democratic Republic is the only way that conforms to the dignity of the German people and the interests of European security.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: TASS, Moscow, November 17th: In commenting on the assertion by the American ruling group that "the status of the Western countries in Berlin is not determined by the Potsdam Agreement, but by the rights of occupation derived from the unconditional surrender of Germany," the Soviet "Pravda" wrote: Quoting the declaration of Germany's unconditional surrender is unfounded, because this declaration pointed out that the victorious countries can only take urgent measures "without prejudice to the decisions that may be taken on Germany in the future."

"Pravda" pointed out that the purpose of occupying Germany was precisely determined by the Potsdam Agreement. The newspaper emphasized that throughout the post-war period, the Soviet government has firmly demanded that the Western countries implement the Potsdam Agreement in West Germany and West Berlin. However, the United States, Britain, and France have grossly violated their obligations, pursued a policy of division in both Germany and Berlin, and openly revived German militarism.

    彻底解决柏林问题时候已到苏联政府既定方针决不动摇
    苏联“真理报”发表观察家文章
    新华社莫斯科18日电　“真理报”今天发表观察家文章指出，苏联政府决定毫不动摇地实现早已酝酿成熟了的关于结束柏林占领制度残余的措施。
    文章说：“如果死保持住在柏林的占领地位不放的西方国家领导人认为，要实现苏联政府既定的措施，就必须取得西方国家的某种同意，那他们就大错特错了。根本不需要任何这样的同意。苏联将坚决执行这个方针，而且一定要实现这个方针。”
    这篇题为“柏林问题的唯一解决办法”的文章写道，彻底解决柏林问题以巩固和平和国际安全的时刻已经到来。西方国家自己已经丧失了维持西柏林占领制度的任何法律上和道义上的权利。柏林的四国占领地位实际上早已不存在。德国存在着两个主权国家，对于占领地位的一切借口早就失去意义。西方国家在柏林人为地制造了一种违反法权和理智的局面，企图实现自己非法驻军柏林的目的，在那里建立基地，以便对民主德国、苏联和其他社会主义国家进行颠覆活动。这种情况是不能容忍的。
    文章接着说，西方国家毫无根据地、毫无意义地企图引用战后最初年代所规定的占领制度中的某些义务来为它们的政策进行辩护。美国国务卿杜勒斯现在提起了关于“管制西柏林的庄严义务”。但是，在波茨坦曾对受战争灾难的各国人民宣誓不让法西斯和军国主义在德国土地上复活，难道美国政客们对这个庄严的誓言就忘记了吗？他们故意破坏这个誓言，践踏波茨坦协定。文章说：“正是由于西方国家，首先是美国的政策，西德正沿着复活军国主义和复仇主义的道路、沿着把西德拖入北大西洋公约组织侵略集团的道路发展”。
    文章说，西方某些人士现在正围绕着柏林问题制造军事狂热气氛，看来他们是想动摇苏联由于关心欧洲和平、关心全体德国人民的民族利益所作出的决定。但是这种办法在处理同苏联的相互关系上并不适用。消除在民主德国首都的占领制度残余，这是唯一符合德国人民尊严和欧洲安全利益的途径。
    据新华社17日讯　塔斯社莫斯科17日讯：苏联“真理报”在评论美国统治集团所谓“西方国家在柏林的地位不是由波茨坦协定来确定，而是由德国无条件投降中得出的占领权利来确定”的说法时写道：引用德国无条件投降的宣言是没有任何根据的，因为这个宣言指出，战胜国只能“在不损害以后可能对德国采取的决定”的条件下才采取迫切的措施。
    “真理报”指出，占领德国的目的正是由波茨坦协定决定的。报纸强调指出，在整个战后时期，苏联政府坚决要求西方国家在西德和西柏林贯彻波茨坦协定。但是，美国、英国和法国粗暴地破坏了它们所承担的义务，对德国和柏林都实行分裂政策，公开复活德国军国主义。
