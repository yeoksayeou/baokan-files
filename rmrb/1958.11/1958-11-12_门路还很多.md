The method adopted by some commercial departments in Shanghai to send 2,000 commercial staff to actively support grassroots commercial departments in purchasing agricultural products during the busy season is excellent.

This year's agricultural harvest is unprecedentedly bountiful. However, this bumper harvest has also brought unprecedentedly heavy purchasing tasks to commercial departments. Since November, the purchase of agricultural products in various regions has entered a decisive stage. The grassroots commercial departments and the broad masses of people in producing areas are, regardless of gender or age, day and night, rushing to purchase and transport agricultural products. Nevertheless, labor, processing, and transportation capabilities are still insufficient. In particular, due to the lack of processing tools and packing materials, and insufficient transportation capacity, the agricultural products that have already been purchased still cannot be shipped out. This has become a very prominent problem in the current purchasing work. At this critical juncture, the Shanghai commercial departments quickly organized a 2,000-strong force to support the front line. How timely this is! There is no doubt that this provides a new avenue for organizing various forces to accelerate the progress of agricultural product procurement.

There are still many avenues for carrying out large-scale purchases and sales on the commercial front. After the rectification movement, the political consciousness of the broad masses of staff and workers in commercial departments has greatly improved, and their enthusiasm is very high. However, to fully utilize the enthusiasm of the masses, it is necessary to pay attention to working methods in order to do a good job of large-scale purchases and sales. Organizing a field army to support the front line is a good method. Judging from the support of the Shanghai commercial departments for agricultural product purchases in the producing areas, the potential of commercial departments in large cities is very great. Since Shanghai can organize such a field army, other large cities must also be able to do so. The current problem is to understand and grasp the situation of agricultural product purchases in the relevant areas, and to determine which link in the process of purchase, processing, and transportation needs the most support, and what they lack. Based on this, make arrangements for support in terms of manpower and materials, and send more "field armies" to the "front line" as soon as possible. The fundamental key to doing a good job in purchasing is still to carry out mass movements on a large scale. First, the staff and workers of the commercial departments must be mobilized, go to the grassroots, and go to the "front line" of purchasing.

    门路还很多
    上海市的一些商业部门在农产品收购十分繁忙的季节里，派出了两千商业工作人员，主动支援基层商业部门收购农产品的办法是十分好的。
    今年农业空前大丰收了，然而丰收也给商业部门带来了空前繁重的收购任务。11月份以来，各地农产品收购已经进入决战阶段，产区基层商业部门和广大人民正在不分男女老幼，不分日夜地突击收购和调运农产品。尽管如此，劳动力、加工和运输力量仍然不足。特别是由于加工工具和打包原料缺乏、运输力不足，已经收购起来的农产品仍然调不出去。这已成为当前收购工作当中十分突出的问题。上海市商业部门在这种困难的关头，迅速组织起一支两千人的生力军，去支援前线，这是多么切合时宜！毫无疑问，这对于组织各种力量加快农产品的收购进度提供了一个新的途径。
    在商业战线上展开大购大销，门路还是很多。广大商业部门的职工群众经过整风运动，政治觉悟有了很大提高，干劲很足，但是要把群众的干劲充分发挥出来还要讲究工作方法，才能做好大购大销的工作。组织野战军支援前线，就是一种好的方法。从上海市商业部门支援产区农产品收购的情况来看，大城市商业部门的潜力是很大的。既然上海能够组织起这样一支野战军，其它大城市也就一定能够做到。当前的问题是要了解和掌握有关地区的农产品收购情况，在收购、加工、调运过程中，哪个环节最需要支援，他们缺少些什么，从而根据这些情况作出在人力、物力上进行支援的安排，尽速把更多的“野战军”开赴“前线”。做好收购工作的根本关键，还是在于大搞群众运动，首先要商业部门的职工运动起来，到基层去，到收购的“前线”上去。
