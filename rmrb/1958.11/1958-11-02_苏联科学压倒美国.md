Welcoming the October Revolution Anniversary

    Soviet Science Surpasses the United States
    Zhu Kezhen

    When the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial Earth satellite on October 4th last year, the political and military leaders of capitalist countries were shocked and panicked, as if struck by lightning. Many suspected that the satellite was a product of German experts captured by the Soviet Union during World War II. Even U.S. President Eisenhower had such thoughts when answering questions from International News Service reporter Clark on October 9th. However, soon after, the Soviet Union's continued successful launch of the second and third artificial Earth satellites on November 3rd last year and May 15th this year, with each satellite heavier than the last and carrying more instruments, forced even those who had always claimed the Soviet Union was backward to be amazed by the Soviet Union's achievements in science.

    The Soviet Union is a socialist country. It values past excellent cultural heritage and, at the same time, attaches even greater importance to educating the younger generation with philosophy, literature, art, and scientific knowledge. Therefore, the Soviet Union allocates a large proportion of its annual national budget to culture, education, and health. For example, in 1957, the Soviet Union's allocation for social and cultural facilities was more than 188.3 billion rubles, accounting for about 31% of the total national budget expenditure, almost double the defense expenditure. In capitalist countries like the United States, defense spending has accounted for three-quarters of the national revenue in recent years, while the funds used for culture, education, and science are minimal. Long before World War II, the Soviet Union's science funding accounted for more than 1% of national expenditure, three times that of the United States and ten times that of the United Kingdom for scientific research. In November last year, A.N. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, told a TASS reporter that "in the past forty years, the number of staff at the Soviet Academy of Sciences has increased a hundredfold, and the budget has almost increased a thousandfold." This shows how much the Soviet government values science and culture.

    Not only do socialist countries value culture and education much more than capitalist countries, but the social customs are also completely different. Comparing Moscow and New York can illustrate the different national spirits of the two countries. Anyone who has been to Moscow knows about Gorky Street, Pushkin Square, the Tchaikovsky Conservatory, and the Lomonosov Moscow State University. Moscow is filled with statues of famous artists, writers, and scientists. As for New York, although it also has famous libraries, museums, and many universities, it is more famous for Rockefeller Center, the Chrysler Building named after the automobile manufacturing tycoon, and Carnegie Hall named after the steel magnate Carnegie. Apart from the Washington statue in Union Square and the General Sherman statue in Central Park, the statue commemorating ancient feats is the statue of former New York Mayor Peter Cooper on Broadway, who was a wealthy merchant. In contrast, one cannot help but feel that Soviet people value literature and science, while Americans worship money. American poet and former Deputy Secretary of State Archibald MacLeish once said some thought-provoking words in his article "The Isolation of the American Artist" in the January issue of "The Atlantic Monthly": He said, "A hundred years ago, America's spokesmen to the world were the philosopher Emerson and the poet Whitman, but now the people who can represent America to the world are bankers and oil merchants, and Americans don't find it strange at all!"

    The basic conditions for the survival and rule of the bourgeoisie are the accumulation of wealth in private hands. Accumulating wealth has become everyone's ultimate goal. Parents use this to educate their children, schools use this to cultivate students, and young people use this to find partners, believing that as long as they have wealth, everything will be fine. But wealth is not everything. Relying on money to hire artists from abroad to develop art and recruit scientists to develop science cannot fundamentally solve the problem.

    American scientists have long made suggestions regarding the need to cultivate talent. Before the end of World War II, Vannevar Bush, Director of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development, in response to questions raised by then-U.S. President Roosevelt: "How to develop science?" "How to cultivate young people?" organized five committees to conduct research and wrote the book "Science—The Endless Frontier" in September 1945. The most incisive passage in the book says: "We can no longer rely on Europe to supply us with the fruits of basic science. To increase the capital of science, there are two things: first, talent, a large number of people with the ability to create new knowledge and discuss practical applications; second, strengthening basic scientific research institutions. … There is a great shortage of talent. During the war, there was a shortage of at least 150,000 science and engineering talents with degrees, and a shortage of 17,000 people with higher degrees. … Cultivating scientific talent is a long and costly process. Talented people are all over the country. The main thing is to admit people to universities and train them based on their talents, not based on their family circumstances."

    After World War II, the shortcomings pointed out in Bush's book were not only not remedied, but the situation worsened. Taking the cultivation of science and engineering talents as an example, in 1950, the United States had 52,000 engineering graduates, but by 1956, it had dropped to 26,000. During the same period, the number of engineers graduating from the Soviet Union doubled, reaching 71,000. When the Soviet artificial Earth satellite went into space last year, the American government and society suddenly woke up and had to admit that they could not catch up with the Soviet Union in cultivating science and engineering talents. According to a report in the American "Science Weekly" in August last year, the tuition fees that American university students must pay have increased rapidly in the past ten years, with some universities increasing as much as ten times, making it difficult for poor students to afford it. Last year, 200,000 high school graduates in the United States had excellent grades but could not afford to go to college, while 700,000 of the new students admitted by universities had very poor grades, only because their parents had money to go to college. In 1957, the U.S. government's expenditure on education and research was only $484 million, accounting for 0.72% of total expenditure. In that year, the money spent on chewing gum was twice as much as the money spent on medical research. Such an unreasonable U.S. education and cultural policy must be attributed to the declining and decadent capitalist social system.

    The Soviet Union is a socialist country. The first superiority of socialist countries is the elimination of the exploiting classes, that is, the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Soviet Union has long achieved this: young people who are eager to learn, regardless of their wealth, can enter universities or specialized schools for free as long as they pass the exams. This is what young people in capitalist countries dream of but cannot achieve. The second superiority is that socialist countries carry out work in an organized and planned manner. Capitalist countries call for free competition, which creates many duplications and waste. The U.S. artificial satellite program, where the Navy and the Army worked independently of each other, is one example. The third superiority is that the Soviet Union is based on Marxism-Leninism and looks at problems with dialectical materialism. Therefore, it focuses on the big picture in culture and education, finds key problems, and does not solve problems piecemeal for the sake of science like capitalist countries.

    In November last year, our government sent a science and technology delegation to Moscow to discuss comprehensive cooperation in science and technology between China and the Soviet Union. During the talks, I also took the time to visit several meteorological, geographical, and geological research institutions and several departments of geosciences at Moscow University and Leningrad University. Based on my observations and conversations with colleagues in the Soviet geosciences community, I got the impression that in terms of geosciences, the Soviet Union's speed and depth of talent cultivation and the quantity and quality of research institutions are better than those of the United States and Britain. Academician Sherbakov, Director of the Department of Earth Sciences of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said in a public report that before the October Revolution, there were only 150 geological science workers and even fewer geophysics personnel in the country. Currently, there are 20,000 geological workers and 15,000 geophysics personnel. In terms of geography, Professor Samoilov told us that in the Tsarist era, there were no more than 200 geography talents who had received higher education, but by 1955, there were 3,400 geography researchers in various Soviet research institutions, as well as 32,000 university and normal university graduates teaching in secondary schools. From the above figures, we can calculate that the number of geosciences talents in the Soviet Union doubles every five to seven years, which is truly amazing. The average growth of scientific talent in the United States in the past forty years has been doubling every ten years, far behind the Soviet Union. In other fields, the speed of talent cultivation in the Soviet Union is similar to that in geosciences. For example, in 1957, the Soviet Union graduated 80,000 engineers, three times that of the United States and twenty-seven times that of the United Kingdom and France. Soviet universities require five years of study, and students studying geosciences in the first and second years must study physics for one and a half years and mathematics for two years. Their foundation in mathematics and physics is also higher than that of geosciences graduates from American universities.

    In the field of earth sciences, the development of Soviet research institutions is also extremely rapid. Taking the Soviet Academy of Sciences as an example, the Institute of Geology and Mineral Deposits and the Institute of Rare Elements and Geochemistry, both expanded from the original laboratories, were newly established in the past three or four years in the field of geology. In the field of geography, the Limnology Laboratory will be converted into an institute this year. In terms of the Institute of Geophysics, there was originally only one institute, but it has recently been divided into the Institute of Applied Geophysics, the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, and the Institute of Geophysics. Before the launch of artificial satellites, the Soviet Institute of Geophysics had used rockets to explore high-altitude physics and obtained more accurate results on the composition of the upper atmosphere than the United States. The United States has not yet established a geophysical research institute of considerable scale.

    The Soviet Union not only applies dialectical materialism to social sciences, but also applies it effectively to natural sciences. The value of science lies in its predictability, and dialectical materialism is a method of mastering this predictability. In the past, Soviet scientists Dokuchaev in geosciences pioneered a new direction in soil science with a developmental perspective, laying the foundation for Soviet soil science and correcting the past errors of soil scientists in capitalist countries who overemphasized climate or geological parent material. Geology also established mineral exploration laws with a developmental perspective, making it possible for geological theory to predict mineral deposits. In climatology, it adheres to Voeikov's excellent tradition and transforms the climate according to the principle of "man can conquer nature." Climate modification has become one of the important issues in science. Soviet geophysicists are studying the use of high-speed electronic computers to accurately make long-term forecasts for a month or a season, and are conducting large-scale research on cloud and fog physics to lay the foundation for eliminating clouds and fog and creating artificial rain. Meteorology is closely related to agriculture, water conservancy, and national defense. In the past, mankind has always relied on the weather, but now it is possible to summon wind and rain. In the United States, meteorology is not valued. The original head of the meteorology department at the California Institute of Technology, but because there was a profit to be made from weather forecasts, the director went into the business of weather forecasting, so the meteorology department was cancelled.

    Since 1957, Soviet and American scientists have resumed exchanges. Last year, Dr. Abelson of the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington visited Soviet geosciences research institutions. After returning to the United States, he published an article in the November issue of "Science Weekly" discussing the equipment, achievements, and scientific information of the Soviet Union and the United States in oceanography, seismology, Arctic research, paleomagnetism, geochemistry, and geology, believing that the two countries are on par in terms of quality, and that the Soviet Union far surpasses the United States in terms of the number of talents and work. He said that the Institute of Geophysics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences alone has 300 people, while the total number of geophysicists in the United States is less than that. But we know that in geology, mineralogy, geography, and seismology, the United States is not "on par" with the Soviet Union in terms of quality, but far behind the Soviet Union.

    苏联科学压倒美国
    竺可桢
    在去年10月4日苏联第一颗人造地球卫星发射成功的时候，资本主义国家的政治和军事首脑像听到晴天霹雳一样，大为惊惶失措，许多人疑心这卫星是第二次大战时苏联所俘掳的德国专家的产品，甚至美国总统艾森豪威尔在10月9日答复国际新闻社记者克拉克的问题时也有这样的想法。但是不久，去年11月3日和今年5月15日苏联第二、三颗人造地球卫星继续成功的发射，卫星的重量一颗比一颗大，随带的仪器一个比一个多，这时候才使向来胡说苏联落后的人们也不得不惊服苏联在科学方面的成就了。
    苏联是社会主义国家，她重视过去的优良文化遗产，同时更重视教育后一代的青年以哲学、文艺和科学知识。因此苏联每年国家预算中文化、教育和卫生方面的预算占了很大的比例。如1957年苏联用在社会文化设施方面的拨款是一千八百八十三亿多卢布，占国家预算总支出的31％左右，差不多是国防费用的一倍。资本主义国家如美国近年来国防经费占全国岁入的四分之三，用于文教科学方面经费却为数极微。远在第二次大战以前，苏联科学经费即占国家岁出1％强，三倍于美国而十倍于英国所用于科学研究的经费。去年11月间苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫告诉塔斯社记者说：“四十年来，苏联科学院工作人员的数目增加到一百倍，预算几乎增加了一千倍”。这就表示着苏联政府如何重视着科学和文化事业。
    不但社会主义国家比资本主义国家对文化教育要重视得多，即社会上风尚也全然是不同的。如以莫斯科和纽约两个城市来评比一下，可以看出两国不同的风尚。凡是到过莫斯科的人谁不知道有高尔基大街、普希金广场、柴可夫斯基音乐学院和以罗曼诺索夫命名的国立莫斯科大学？莫斯科城中满布了著名艺术家文学家和科学家的铜像。至于纽约虽然也有著名的图书馆、博物馆并拥有许多大学，但是更为人人所称道的则是洛克菲勒中心、以汽车制造业巨头克莱斯勒命名的大厦、以钢铁大王卡内基命名的音乐厅。而纪念古来丰功伟绩的铜像除联合广场的华盛顿像和中央公园的休曼将军像以外，要算百老汇路的纽约前市长佩斯特像了，他是一个有钱的商人。相形之下，使人不得不感觉到苏联人重视文艺科学而美国人崇拜金钱。美国著名诗人前副国务卿马克利许在今年1月份“大西洋月刊”所著“美国艺术家的寂寞”一文中曾经说过这样几句耐人寻味的话：他说“一百年以前美国对世界的代言人是哲学家爱默生和诗人惠特曼，而现在能代表美国向世界说话的人却是银行家和石油商人，而美国人却一点不以为奇”！
    资产阶级的生存和统治的基本条件是财富蓄积于私人手中。蓄积财富成了人人的终极目标，父母以此来教育子弟，学校以此来培植学生，青年以此来找对象，以为只要有财富便万事大吉。但财富并不是一切，靠金钱到外国聘请艺术家来发展艺术，罗致科学家来发展科学是不能基本解决问题的。
    关于培植人才的必要性，美国自己的科学家已早经有所建议了。第二次大战尚未结束的时候，美国科学研究与发展局主任范内瓦·布须应当时的美国总统罗斯福所提问题：“如何发展科学？”“如何培植青年？”组织了五个委员会进行研究，并于1945年9月写成了“科学——无止境的前线”一书。书中最警辟的一段这样说：“我们不能再依赖欧洲供给我们以基础科学的成果。要增加科学的资本有二：一是人才，大量有创造新知识能力并能讨论实用的人才；二是加强基本科学研究机构。……人才缺乏很多，战争期间至少缺乏十五万取得学位的理工人才，缺乏更高级以上学位的人一万七千人。……培养科学人才是长期而且费钱的过程，有天才的人全国各地都有，主要是依据人们的才能来进大学来培养，而不是依据他们的家庭状况”。
    第二次大战以后，布须书中所指出的缺点不但没有得到补救，反而情形更坏。以培养理工人才而论，在1950年美国工科毕业学生是五万二千人，到1956年却下降到二万六千人。而同时期苏联所毕业的工程师却上升一倍，达七万一千人。等到去年苏联人造地球卫星上了天以后，美国政府和社会才如梦方醒，只好承认在培植理工人才方面已无法追上苏联。据去年8月间美国“科学周刊”的报道，美国大学学生应交的学费近十年来增加很快，若干大学增加竟达十倍，使穷学生只好望洋兴叹，无法进大学之门。去年美国中学毕业生中有二十万人成绩优良，但进不起大学，而大学所招新生七十万人中却有成绩很差的学生，只因父母有钱才得进大学。1957年度，美国政府用在教育和研究方面的支出仅有四亿八千四百万美元，占总支出的0.72％。而在这一年里，耗费在口香糖上的钱要比用在医学研究工作上的多一倍。美国教育文化政策之如此不合理不能不归根到没落的和腐朽的资本主义社会制度。
    苏联是社会主义国家。社会主义国家的第一个优越性是剥削阶级的消灭，也就是无产阶级专政。苏联早已做到：有志学习的青年，不论贫富，只要通过考试都可以免费进入大学或专门学校。这是资本主义国家青年人所梦想而无法达到的。第二个优越性是社会主义国家有组织有计划地进行工作，资本主义国家以自由竞争相号召，造成许多重复和浪费现象，美国人造卫星计划，海军和陆军互不相谋地工作即其一例。第三个优越点是苏联以马克思列宁主义为基础，以唯物辩证法看问题，所以在文化教育方面都是大处着眼，找到关键性问题，不像资本主义国家为科学而科学，枝枝节节地去解决问题。
    去年11月间我国政府派遣了科学技术代表团到莫斯科商谈中苏科学技术全面合作问题。在会谈期间，我还抽空参观了几个气象、地理、地质、研究机关和莫斯科大学、列宁格勒大学关于地学的几个系。据观察所及和苏联地学界同人的谈话，我得到这样的印象，就是以地学方面而论，苏联培植人才的速度、深度和研究机构的数量和质量上，都比美英有过之而无不及。苏联科学院地学部主任雪尔培考夫院士在公开报告中说，在十月革命以前，全国只有地质科学工作人员一百五十人，地球物理方面的人员更少，而目前地质工作人员已达两万人，地球物理人员一万五千人。在地理方面，据萨莫伊洛夫教授告诉我们，帝俄时代受过高等教育的地理人才不过二百人，但到1955年，苏联各研究机关已有三千四百名地理研究人员，还有在中等学校当教师的大学和师范大学毕业生三万二千人。从上面的数字我们可以算出，苏联地学人才每五年到七年就增加一倍，其速度之快实足惊人。美国过去四十年中科学人才的增长平均为每十年增一倍，较之苏联远远落后。在其他方面，苏联人才培养之速也和地学科学相似，如1957年苏联工科毕业的工程师达八万名，等于美国的三倍，等于英国和法国的二十七倍。苏联大学是五年毕业的，在一、二年级学地学的人必须读物理一年半、数学两年，他们数理的根底也超出美国大学地学系毕业生。
    在地球科学方面，苏联研究机构发展也极迅速。以苏联科学院而论，近三、四年中地质方面新成立了地质矿床研究所和稀有元素及地球化学研究所，都是原来的实验室扩建的。在地理方面，湖沼实验室今年将改建为所。在地球物理所方面原只有一个所，近已分建为应用地球物理研究所、大气物理研究所和地球物理所。在人造卫星未发射以前，苏联地球物理所对于高空物理研究方面已用火箭探测，对高层大气成份所得结果较美国为精确。美国直到如今全国尚未建立一个有相当规模的地球物理研究所。
    苏联不但把自然辩证法应用之于社会科学，也应用之于自然科学而有效。科学之所以可贵就是因其有预见性，而唯物辩证法就是掌握这种预见性的一个方法。苏联在地学方面过去道古且也夫以发展的观点开辟了土壤学的新方向，奠定了苏联土壤学的基础，纠正了过去资本主义国家土壤学家偏重气候或地质母岩的错误。地质学方面也以发展观点而建立寻矿规律，使地质学的理论有预告矿产的可能。在气候学方面坚持华也可夫的优良传统，依人定胜天的原则来改造气候。改造气候已成为科学上重要问题之一。苏联地球物理学家正在研究运用高速电子计算机来正确地做出一个月或一季度的长期预告，并大规模地研究云雾物理，为消灭云雾和制造人工雨打下基础。气象对于农业、水利、国防都有密切关系，过去人类一向靠天吃饭，而现在已有呼风唤雨之可能。在美国，气象学不受重视。加利福尼亚州理工大学原有气象系主任，可是因为预告天气有利可图，这位主任去做天气预告的生意了，所以气象系就被取消了。
    从1957年起，苏联和美国科学家又有了来往。去年曾有美国华盛顿卡内基学院地球物理实验室阿倍尔生博士到苏联参观地学研究机构，他回国后在去年十一月号“科学周刊”上发表文章，谈到苏联和美国在海洋学、地震学、北极研究、古地磁学、地球化学、地质学方面的设备、成就和科学情报，认为在质的方面两国不相上下，在量方面苏联人才和工作远远超出美国。他说苏联科学院的地球物理所一个所就有三百人，而美国全国的地球物理学家还不到此数。但是我们知道，在地质学、矿物学、地理学和地震学方面，美国在质的方面也并不是和苏联“不相上下”，而是远远落后于苏联的。
