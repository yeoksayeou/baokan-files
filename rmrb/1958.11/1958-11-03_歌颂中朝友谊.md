    Ode to Sino-Korean Friendship
    Guo Moruo
    In the autumn of 1958, the Chinese People's Delegation was invited to Korea to participate in the "China-Korea Friendship Month" activities. They crossed the Yalu River on September 28th to go abroad and returned across the Yalu River on October 26th, spending a total of 28 days visiting Korea. I composed forty-eight poems in the old style as a small collection to mark the occasion. (November 1, 1958)

        At the Sinuiju Station
        The flags of the two countries line the road, a sea of red,
        The train speeds east across the Yalu River.
        Mountains and rivers bear the stains of past bloody battles,
        Fertile soil yields bountiful autumn harvests.
        A burst of drums fills the bright sunlit sky,
        Circles of dancers ripple in the gentle breeze.
        Even a short stop at the station is hard to say goodbye,
        Eight years shoulder to shoulder, we are no longer strangers.

    After visiting the cave where Commander Peng Dehuai stayed
    Sino-Korean friendship is forged in blood,
    Brothers united in hatred, sharing life and death.
    Springwater in the cave flows with drops of sweat,
    Stubborn rocks in the moat turn into billowing smoke.
    The heroic city shines again in the sun,
    The martyrs' cemetery stands for eternity.
    No wonder we are reluctant to part,
    Hair-woven shoes are given as parting gifts. [Note]
    [Note] Refers to the Korean old woman who cut off her hair to weave straw shoes for the departing volunteer soldiers.

        After visiting Panmunjom
        The mat at Panmunjom remains as it was,
        A line divides two different worlds.
        The southern fields are deserted, a wasteland,
        Northern mountains sing of a year of plenty.
        The world sees clearly and completely,
        Two devils patrol back and forth. [Note]
        The paper tiger, though wounded, still brandishes its might,
        Pitifully rushing into the fiery pit of its own making.
    [Note] Refers to two American military police patrolling back and forth, looking peculiar and particularly jarring.

        Presented to Korean Comrades
        Aiding Korea and resisting America is for peace,
        The relationship of lips and teeth is clear.
        The martyrs sought benevolence without regret,
        Good neighbors cherish virtue with great affection.
        The rivers and mountains are a beautiful three thousand li,
        Ten thousand swords are sharpened.
        Pointing to the day when the evil forces will be swept away,
        The southern sky will be clear, saving all living beings.

    At the farewell rally for the Volunteer Army
    Arriving in Korea eight years ago, we fought as comrades,
    Brave warriors shed tears at the parting.
    All the people cheer, even the grass and trees,
    A surge of hot blood fills every heart.
    The people's friendship is as vast as the universe,
    The international spirit as high as the sun and moon.
    A sea of deep affection surpasses flesh and blood,
    Eternal victory belongs to us.
    Accompanied by Vice Premier Hong Myung-hee to visit Mount Kumgang,
    I was presented with a poem, and I respond in the same rhyme.
        Climbing Mount Kumgang, fortunate to have this chance,
        How many times does the beauty turn in my breast?
        The fairy's form, slender and scraping the sky,
        The Buddha's countenance, solemn through endless eons. [One]
        Frosty leaves drunk and sated in the drizzling rain,
        The Milky Way bows down beside the colorful clouds.
        We will fulfill our promise at Haeundae,
        Unifying the country is inevitable. [Two]
    [Note One] Mount Kumgang has twelve thousand peaks, including Three Immortal Peaks and Lone Immortal Peak with rugged rocks; also World Honored Peak and Vairocana Peak, mostly named after Buddha.
    [Note Two] Haeundae is a famous scenic spot near Busan. Elder Hong and I agreed to climb it together after the reunification of Korea.

    Visiting the Korean Liberation Struggle Museum
    A hundred years of liberation struggle history,
    Events occurred slightly later than in China.
    Sharing the same boat through thick and thin, we finally succeeded together,
    Brotherly friendship lasts for ten thousand years.

          Ode to Pyongyang, Reborn After the Fire
        Like a phoenix risen from the ashes,
        The heroic nation's spirit soars.
        Songs of abundant harvest spread through the suburbs,
        A common stream flows into the ocean.

                              [Unfinished]

    歌颂中朝友谊
    郭沫若
    1958年秋中国人民代表团应邀赴朝鲜，参加“朝中友好月”活动。以9月28日渡过鸭绿江出国，以10月26日夏渡鸭绿江回国，计在朝访问凡28日，得旧体诗四十八首，录为一小集，以志纪念。　　（1958年11月1日）
        在新义州站上两国旌旗夹道红，火轮驰过鸭江东。山川碧血遗痕在，土壤膏腴秋获丰。一片鼓声通皓日，数圈轮舞漾和风。站头小驻犹难别，八载并肩自不同。
  参观彭总所住岩洞后中朝友谊血凝成，兄弟同仇共死生。洞里流泉随汗滴，濠中顽石化烟横。英雄城市辉重日，烈士陵园亘万龄。无怪依依难割舍，发编双履送人行。〔注〕
    〔注〕朝鲜老大娘有剪下头发，编成草鞋，为志愿军战士送行者。
        参观板门店后板门店里席依然，一线分开两样天。南甸无人成废地，北山有鸟颂丰年。万方视听明而彻，二鬼巡逻往复旋。〔注〕纸虎鳞伤犹耀武，剧怜自窜火坑边。
    〔注〕有美国宪兵二人往来巡逻，形态奇异，特别刺目。
        赠朝鲜同志援朝抗美为和平，唇齿辅车事理明。烈士求仁无点憾，善邻怀德甚多情。江山锦绣三千里，宝剑磨砻十万横。指日妖氛看荡扫，南天晴朗济苍生。
    在欢送志愿军大会上来朝八载赋同袍，勇士临歧泪亦抛。万姓欢呼连草木，满腔热血涌波涛。人民友谊乾坤远，国际精神日月高。海样深情逾骨肉，永恒胜利属吾曹。洪命熹副首相陪游金刚山，
  赋诗见赠，步原韵奉酬。同上金刚幸有缘，胸中秀色几回旋。仙姿瘦削摩天日，佛相庄严历劫年。〔一〕霜叶醉酣酥雨里，银河拜倒彩霞边。海云后约期先践，统一江山事必然。〔二〕
    〔注一〕金刚山有一万二千峰，其中有三仙峰、独仙峰，岩骨嶙峋；又有世尊峰、毘卢峰等，多以佛号为名。
    〔注二〕海云台乃釜山附近名胜，洪老相约，于朝鲜统一后，同往登临。
    参观朝鲜解放斗争博物馆百年解放斗争史，事与中州略后先。患难同舟终共济，友于情谊万斯年。
          颂平壤市火后再生有凤凰，英雄民族气轩昂。丰收歌颂传郊野，一脉大同入海洋。
                              〔未完〕
