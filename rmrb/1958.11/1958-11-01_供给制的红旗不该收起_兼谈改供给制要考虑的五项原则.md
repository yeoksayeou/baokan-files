    The Red Flag of the Supply System Should Not Be Lowered
    Also Discussing Five Principles to Consider When Reforming the Supply System
    Yi Ming
    After liberation, due to the rapid expansion of the revolutionary ranks, a situation of co-existence of the supply system and the wage system emerged, which was unavoidable under the historical conditions at the time. Later, the conversion of personnel who originally implemented the supply system to the wage system was not inevitable. This is because the specific conditions of these two groups of personnel are different: those enjoying the supply system are generally from the old liberated areas, with a glorious tradition and habit of implementing the supply system, and a higher political awareness and communist ideology; other young intellectuals who newly joined the workforce and enjoyed the supply system are generally very young, with little or no family burden, and ideologically progressive, and many are proud to enjoy the supply system and unwilling to implement the wage system. Based on these specific circumstances, I believe that if we could have promptly summarized the past experiences of implementing the supply system, continued to adhere to the supply system after liberation, and established the supply system as a red flag, and expanded the scope of the supply system in a planned and step-by-step manner to gradually replace the wage system, it would not have been absolutely impossible. In fact, the supply system persisted for six years after the national liberation. May I ask, if the supply system could be implemented for the past six years, why couldn't it be implemented for the next three years? In this sense, changing this part of the people to wage system treatment is actually a compromise and concession to bourgeois legal thought, and can also be said to be a step backward.
    Currently, various regions are studying how to change the existing wage system to a supply system. I believe that the following principles or methods should be considered when formulating supply standards for cadres.
    First, because there are still differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and manual and mental labor, and material conditions are not very abundant, the treatment of cadres cannot be completely determined according to the principle of "each according to their needs," and the factor of "distribution according to labor" still needs to account for an appropriate proportion. For this reason, the change to the supply system should adopt the method of "half supply and half wage," that is, in addition to the items that are necessary for everyone's life and that can be supplied now, a certain amount of allowance should be issued for personal use. In the future, with the development of production, the "distribution according to labor" factor should be gradually reduced, while increasing the "each according to their needs" part, so as to "from low to high," and finally fully achieve the principle of "each according to their needs." Second, when considering supply standards, we should start from the 600 million population, and at the same time appropriately take into account the actual living standards of the vast majority of middle and lower-level staff. A certain distance can still be maintained between cadres and the people, but it should not be too large, so as to facilitate socialist production and internal unity of the people. Third, when considering the allowance standards for cadres, the difference in amounts between superiors and subordinates should be smaller, the number of levels should be greatly reduced, and the difference between the current highest and lowest wages should be greatly reduced, so as to facilitate unity and communization among staff. Fourth, the economic development of various regions across the country is currently uneven, so the supply standards need not be forcibly unified for the time being, and it is better for each region to adapt to local conditions under the premise of not exceeding the existing total wage amount. When considering supply standards, each region should start from the living standards of the local people, that is, the standards can be higher in areas with high living standards, and the standards should be correspondingly lower in areas with low living standards. Of course, the difference between regions should not be too large. Fifth, changing to the supply system is a communist revolution in the distribution system, which is related to everyone's vital interests and should widely use the working method of the mass line. It is recommended that after the leading department formulates principles and plans, they should be submitted to the masses to conduct a major debate in the form of great airing of views, great contending, and big-character posters. In this way, not only can the wisdom of the masses be gathered to make the principles and plans for the reform more perfect, but more importantly, the people will receive a vivid communist education.

    供给制的红旗不该收起
    兼谈改供给制要考虑的五项原则
    一鸣
    解放以后，由于革命队伍的迅速扩大，出现了供给制、工资制并存的局面，这在当时的历史条件下是不可避免的。后来将原来实行供给制的工作人员改为工资制，这却不是不可避免的。这是因为这两部分工作人员的具体条件有所不同：享受供给制待遇的，一般都是从老解放区来的，具有实行供给制待遇的光荣传统和习惯，具有较高的政治觉悟和共产主义思想；另外一些享受供给制待遇的新参加工作的青年知识分子一般都很年轻，没有或少有家庭负担，思想要求进步，许多都以享受供给制为荣，不愿实行工资制。根据这些具体情况，我认为如果能够及时地总结过去实行供给制的经验，解放后继续坚持实行供给制待遇，并把供给制当作一面红旗树立起来，有计划、有步骤地扩大供给制的范围，使之逐步代替工资制，也并非是绝对不可能的。事实上，供给制在全国解放后坚持了六年之久。试问，过去六年可以实行供给制，为什么以后三年就不可以实行供给制了呢？从这个意义上说，把这一部分人改为工资制待遇，实际上就是对资产阶级法权思想的妥协和让步，也可以说是倒退了一步。
    目前各地都在研究怎样把现行的工资制改为供给制待遇问题。我以为在制定干部供给标准的时候，应当考虑到以下一些原则或方法。
    第一，现时因为工农、城乡、体力与脑力劳动之间还有差别，物质条件也并不是十分丰富，所以干部的待遇不能完全根据“各取所需”的原则确定，“按劳取酬”的因素还需占有适当比重。为此，改行供给制待遇应该采取“半供给半工资”的办法，即除了属于生活中人人必需而现在又有条件供给的项目予以供给之外，应该另发一部分津贴费由个人支配。今后随着生产的发展，在逐渐减少“按劳取酬”因素的同时，增加“各取所需”部分，以便“由低级到高级”，最后完全达到“各取所需”的原则。第二，考虑供给标准时，应该从六亿人口出发，同时适当照顾到目前广大中下层工作人员的实际生活水平。干部和人民群众之间仍可保有一定的距离，但不应该太大，以利于社会主义生产和人民内部的团结。第三，在考虑干部津贴标准的时候，上下级之间的款数差别应该小一些，大大减少级别数目，并大大缩小现行最高工资与最低工资间相差的倍数，以利于工作人员之间的团结和共产主义化。第四，目前全国各地的经济发展还不平衡，因而供给的标准暂可不必强求统一，以在不超过现有工资总额的前题下由各地因地制宜为好。各地在考虑供给标准的时候，应从当地人民群众的生活水平出发，即在生活水平高的地区标准可以高一些，在生活水平低的地区标准应该相应地低一些。当然，地区之间的差别也不宜太大。第五，改行供给制是在分配制度上所进行的共产主义革命，它关系到每个人的切身利益，应该广泛运用群众路线的工作方法。建议领导部门制定出原则和方案以后交由群众用大鸣、大放、大字报的方式开展一次大争大辩。这样，不仅可以集中群众智慧使改制的原则和方案更加完善，更重要的是对人们进行一场生动的共产主义教育。
