Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch: Teachers and students of the Preschool Education Department of Beijing Normal University, in conjunction with teaching reform, have gone in large numbers to factories, the countryside, and neighborhoods to run short-term training classes for kindergarten teachers. In the past few months, they have successively trained more than 4,400 educators and childcare workers. Currently, more than 80 teachers and students are in the Zhoukoudian District of Beijing, in eight people's communes, simultaneously training kindergarten teachers and conducting experimental research on preschool education in thirty kindergartens.

Many women who had just left their homes and just removed their illiteracy have become educators and childcare workers in kindergartens after a short period of study. People often see them leading groups of innocent and lively children singing, dancing, making toys, telling stories to the children, and telling them how their parents grow sweet potatoes and corn. They all want to make sure the children eat well, play well, sleep well, and are well-educated, striving to plant red flags in kindergarten work. Mothers are relieved to leave their children in their care and participate in production because they see that they are taking good care of the children. In running short-term training classes, the teachers and students of Beijing Normal University paid special attention to strengthening the political and ideological education of educators and childcare workers, improving their awareness, inviting local Party organization leaders to give them reports on the political situation, and leading them to launch great airing of views, great contending, and great debates, debating for whom to educate children, how to educate children, and what kind of people to educate children into. After airing views and debates, they realized that kindergarten work is also a part of socialist construction, and without their work, more women would not be liberated to participate in production. At the same time, educating the next generation is also a very glorious task.

Teachers and students, in combination with the actual situation of local kindergartens, teach educators and childcare workers basic knowledge of preschool education; teach them how to use all kinds of waste materials to make toys, inspiring their creativity; and select kindergartens with better activities to hold on-site meetings.

In running short-term training classes for kindergarten teachers, the teachers and students of Beijing Normal University have further realized that kindergartens can only be run well, developed, and consolidated by relying on the masses and running kindergartens diligently and thriftily under the leadership of the Party; and realized that there were many phenomena in the past teaching that were divorced from reality. The teachers and students realized the mistake of neglecting communist ideology and labor education for young children in the past teaching content. All of these have made them clear that it is necessary to further break down bourgeois educational ideas and thoroughly carry out teaching reform. (Attached picture)

    北京师大师生下厂下乡下街道
    办训练班培训幼儿教师
    新华社18日讯　北京师范大学教育系学前教育专业师生，结合教学改革，大批地下乡、下厂、下街道，大办幼儿教师短期训练班。几个月来，他们已先后培训了四千四百多名教养员、保育员。目前还有八十多名师生在京郊周口店区八个人民公社一面培训幼儿教师，一面在三十个幼儿园进行幼儿教育的实验研究。
    许多刚刚走出家门和刚刚摘掉文盲帽子的妇女，经过短期学习，已成了幼儿园的教养员、保育员了。人们常看到她们带着一群群的天真活泼的孩子唱歌、跳舞、做玩具，给孩子们讲故事，告诉孩子们爸爸妈妈是怎样种出白薯、玉米的。她们个个都想让孩子吃好、玩好、睡好，并且把孩子教育好，争取在幼儿工作上插红旗。母亲们看到她们把孩子管得很好，也都放心把孩子交给她们照管而自己去参加生产。北京师范大学师生在办短期训练班中，特别注意了对教养员、保育员加强政治思想教育，提高她们的觉悟，请当地党组织负责人给她们做政治形势报告，领导她们展开大鸣大放大辩论，辩论为谁教育孩子、怎样教育孩子、把孩子教育成什么样子等问题。经过鸣放辩论，她们认识到幼儿工作也是社会主义建设的一部分，没有她们的工作，就解放不了更多的妇女参加生产，同时教育下一代也是十分光荣的任务。
    师生们结合当地幼儿园的实际情况，给教养员、保育员们讲幼儿教育的基本知识；教给他们怎样利用种种废料做玩具，启发他们的创造性；并且选择活动较好的幼儿园开现场会议。
    北京师范大学师生在大办幼儿教师短期训练班中，更加认识到必须在党的领导下，依靠群众办园，勤俭办园，才能把幼儿园办好，使它发展和巩固；认识到过去在教学中还有许多脱离实际的现象。师生们认识了过去教学内容中忽视对幼儿的共产主义思想和劳动教育的错误。这些，都使得他们明确了必须进一步破除资产阶级教育思想，彻底进行教学改革。（附图片）
