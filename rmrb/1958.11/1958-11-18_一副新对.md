The late rice was just harvested, and we joyfully celebrated the bumper harvest. After a day of work, we gathered to enjoy wine. Under the lamplight, listening to our children and grandchildren singing and reading, joy filled the house. In the past, all that could be heard in the countryside were complaints, cries, and arguments. Today, the situation has changed, and what we hear are laughter, songs, and the sound of reading. I composed the following couplet:

	Laughter, songs, and the sound of reading, every sound enters the ear.
	Commune affairs, national affairs, world affairs, every affair is of concern.

		Shi Damu, Dongfeng People's Commune, Yinxian County, Zhejiang

    一副新对
    晚稻初刈，喜获丰收，一天劳动之余，置酒相慰。灯下听儿孙唱歌读书，欢笑满门。过去乡村中所听到的，只有怨声、哭声、争吵声，今日情形一变，听到的是笑声、歌声、读书声。作联如下：
    笑声歌声读书声声声入耳
    社事国事天下事事事关心
      浙江鄞县东风人民公社史大木
