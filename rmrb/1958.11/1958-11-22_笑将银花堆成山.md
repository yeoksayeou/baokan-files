    Laughing, They Piled the Silver Flowers into Mountains
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng

    Phoenix Spreads Its Wings
    It was still pitch black, but Ding Fengying, the forty-eight-year-old women's squad leader of the Cuizhuang People's Commune in Anyang County, Henan, woke up suddenly as if someone had pushed her. Today, the entire commune was launching a crash harvest of cotton. She quickly got up, lit the lamp, woke up Yan Zhiying and Wang Yuxiu, who were cooking in the canteen, and went out.

    As soon as she went out, she saw a dark shadow in front of her. On closer inspection, she realized it was squad leader Liu Jinsheng. After a brief laugh, they parted ways to call the commune members. Lights were on in every household. Women with children were busy feeding and dressing them, and the nursery school grannies were coming to pick up the children. By the time steaming baskets of glutinous rice cakes and fragrant millet porridge were brought out from the canteen, the east was just beginning to dawn.

    At this time, from the hills to the plains, from the forty-four villages of the Anfeng People's Commune, with its 32,000 residents, a force of 13,000 people (including 5,000 middle and primary school students) marched out. Every house was locked, every door closed, men and women, young and old, all rushing to the fields, launching a large-scale battle. In the fields, red flags were flying, and heads were bobbing in the cotton fields, truly a general with an order, a camp of soldiers under a flag. Each camp deployed its formations, and the battle was truly lively and extraordinary. Look at the first camp, spreading out in a serpentine formation, attacking the large cotton fields. The second camp, attacking along the west, spread out in a phoenix-spreading-wings formation. The third camp, along the hilly area, formed a circle formation. The fourth camp, dividing into squads to harvest patches of cotton fields, formed a five-tigers-herding-sheep formation. The fifth camp, each squad harvesting a long strip of cotton field, performed a pearl-inverting-curtain formation. The students attacked small patches of cotton, forming a nine-bend-Yellow-River formation. The harvested cotton was piled up everywhere. Someone asked Secretary Zhou of the Commune Party Committee, who loved to arrange formations: What kind of formation is this? Secretary Zhou replied calmly with a smile: This is naturally the Seven Stars Formation arranged by Zhuge Liang. The momentum of the entire commune today in rushing to harvest cotton can truly be described as thousands of troops and horses working together, with heroes from all walks of life displaying their unique abilities.

    Every Boll a Labor of Love
    It's really strange, the cotton in the Anfeng People's Commune this year is growing amazingly well, with each of the 52,000 mu of cotton fields yielding an average of about 1,000 jin of seed cotton. Such a bumper harvest is something that not only young people have never seen, but even veteran model farmer Ding Xinchun and cotton-growing expert Ding Fengying never dreamed of such good cotton. Ding Fengying clearly remembered that last year's cotton was generally a little over two chi tall, at most three chi, with five or six bolls per plant being considered good. This year's cotton is generally five chi tall, with the tallest being seven or eight chi, and the most having over a hundred cotton bolls per plant. Last year, Fengying had to bend over to pick cotton, and her back would ache so much she couldn't straighten up after picking for a while; this year, she had to look up to pick the cotton.

    Such a bumper harvest was naturally not easy to come by. In March, the sixty-nine-year-old hero Ding Xinchun jumped into the water, which was covered with ice, and diverted the water to the fields to irrigate the cotton seeds; in June, under the scorching sun, Fengying led the women to treat the cotton for pests branch by branch. The pesticides "666" and "DDT" made people feel dizzy, and sweat dripped directly onto the cotton branches. Then there was watering, topdressing, topping, and pruning. More than 10,000 men and women of the commune worked hard spring and summer, tending to each plant by hand as if they were taking care of children. These bolls of cotton, the result of the harvest, condensed the hard work of so many people.

    The ripe cotton was waiting to be picked, and the commune successively organized two major battles to rush harvest the cotton. But after picking it once, the branches were still covered with white. Today is the third battle. Next to Ding Fengying's squad is the ninth squad of Zhangjiazhuang. This squad of more than sixty people is almost all women. They are skillful and pick cotton cleanly and quickly. Leading the way is thirty-six-year-old Dong Dizhi. She pinches the peduncle with both hands and gently twists it, and handfuls of cotton fall into her apron. The snow-white and soft cotton, hanging in clusters on the branches, is so smooth and lovable, just like the little face of her four-month-old son, Little Happiness. Dong Dizhi had three daughters until she gave birth to a son in July of this year when the commune was established. She couldn't help but be overjoyed and named her son Happiness. Little Happiness was born lucky, and as soon as he was born, he was taken care of by the nursery school grandmas. He eats, smiles, and grows up plump and white, allowing his mother to go to the fields without any worries. At this time last year, Dong Dizhi was taking care of three children alone, busy in the fields and unable to take care of the home. Her heart was in the home while her body was in the field, and she could only pick seventy or eighty jin of cotton a day. Now, Little Happiness is in the nursery, her nine-year-old eldest daughter Mizhen and seven-year-old second daughter Fengying are in elementary school, eating and sleeping at school, and three-year-old Yunzhen is in kindergarten. Her husband is in the steel factory and rarely comes home. She eats in the labor canteen and has nothing to worry about, so she can concentrate on working and pick over 180 jin a day.

    Little Heroes Assist
    The students of the Communist Second Elementary School of the commune are singing while picking cotton. The children have started a competition. Seven-year-old Fengzhen surpassed eight-year-old Xiuqin, and nine-year-old Mizhen overtook eight-year-old Suqin. Their little aprons are filled with cotton. They send it to the end of the field and hurry back to pick more. In one morning, Mizhen and Suqin picked over twenty jin each. They are all first and second grade elementary school students, and since they can remember, they have been on the commune's land, using their own hands to add wealth to the collective, and they regard labor as a glorious and heroic undertaking. Look at their little eyes enviously staring at the green scarf around Mizhen's neck. That's the prize Mizhen's mother, Dong Dizhi, won for picking cotton quickly. Thirteen-year-old Chen Xiaohua also has the same scarf tied on her head, which she won in the last cotton-picking competition. Xiaohua is a capable girl. Her father is over seventy years old and cannot work well. She also has younger brothers and sisters, and her mother was afraid that she would not be able to take care of the family, so she did not let her go to school and instead had her participate in labor at home, using her young hands to help her elderly parents bear the burden of the family's livelihood. She is a sensible girl, and she had to suppress her inner desire to go to school, following her brothers to learn a few characters. It wasn't until the establishment of the commune that her father entered the Happiness Home, her mother went to the iron smelting plant, and the commune provided her with schooling. At the age of thirteen, she carried her schoolbag for the first time and went to school with her seven-year-old sister. But she is very smart, entering the second grade, and then moving up to the third grade a month later. She is not only good at studying, but also excels at labor, always being a model. No wonder the children are always so envious and fond of her. Now she is picking cotton quickly with both hands, picking fifteen jin a day.

    Cotton Piles Up Like Mountains
    Who is carrying that 200+ jin of cotton and running, who is carrying 170-180 jin of cotton on their back like a small mountain? These are the volunteers who have just returned from Korea. They are still carrying the dust of foreign lands on their backpacks. As soon as they stepped on the land of their motherland, they immediately rushed to help their hometown relatives harvest cotton.

    When they went to Korea, their families were still individual households and mutual aid groups, and cotton yielded only 40+ jin per mu. But now, as soon as they crossed the Yalu River, the train was speeding through the commune's land. They didn't even sleep, and they opened their eyes wide, feeling that their eyes weren't enough. It seemed that the route was somewhat different from the route they had taken when they went abroad, and the station was also different from the station they had seen when they went abroad. There were so many factories and so many chimneys along the way. What was burning red on half the sky were thousands, tens of thousands of earthen blast furnaces. Steel and iron were flowing everywhere in the motherland. How could they not be excited! And as soon as they arrived in Anyang, they saw an endless stretch of cotton fields, taller than people, with silver flowers blooming everywhere. They put down their backpacks and wanted to pick cotton, only regretting that they didn't have enough energy to use, not as good as the people of the motherland in the Great Leap Forward. The soldiers carried this kind of mood, one competing with another, each like a little tiger, lifting and carrying loads of 100-200 jin of cotton and running. Some simply put a small mountain of cotton on their heads, imitating the way the Korean people did it.

    In the processing plant, the ten-odd mu large square was soon filled with piles of cotton, piling higher and higher, and mountains of cotton stood on the square. The snow-white cotton shone brightly in the sun, like beautiful silver flowers. And the volunteer soldiers, students, workers, cotton girls, steel girls, office cadres..., were still constantly carrying cotton to send it, more and more. The courtyard was full of people, full of songs and laughter. They laughed and sang, piling up the bags of cotton, piling them into silver mountains.

    笑将银花堆成山
    本报记者　金凤
    凤凰大展翅
    天还黑漆漆地，河南安阳县安丰人民公社崔庄四十八岁的妇女连长丁凤英，却像给人推了一把似地猛地醒了过来。今儿全公社突击收棉花。她连忙起来点了灯，叫醒了在食堂做饭的严志英和王玉秀，就开门出去了。
    一出门，只见眼前晃着一个黑影，定睛一看才知道是连长刘金生。两人笑了一阵就分头去叫社员了。只见家家户户灯火都亮了起来，有孩子的妇女忙着给孩子喂乳、穿衣，托儿所的老妈妈挨家来接孩子。等到食堂里一笼笼热气腾腾的蒸糕和香喷喷的小米粥端了出来，东方刚刚透亮。
    这时候从丘陵到平原，有着三万二千居民的安丰人民公社的四十四个村庄里，一队队地开出一万三千人马（中、小学生就来了五千），家家落锁，户户关门，男女老少一齐奔向田间，摆开了大兵团作战。只见田野里红旗招展，棉田里人头攒动，真个是一个将军一支令，一杆旗下一营兵。各营摆开了阵势，作战委实热闹非凡。你看那第一营铺开了一字长蛇阵，向着大面积的棉田进攻。第二营沿着西边突击，摆开了凤凰大展翅。那第三营，沿着丘陵地区围成了罗圈阵。第四营分连收摘一片片的棉田，摆了五虎群羊阵。第五营每连分摘一长溜棉田，来了个珍珠倒卷帘。学生们突击小片棉花，摆了个九曲黄河阵。那收摘起来的棉花，一堆堆遍地存放。有人问那爱摆阵势的公社党委周书记：这算啥阵势？周书记不慌不忙笑答着：这自然是诸葛亮摆的七星阵。全公社今天这番抢收棉花的声势，真说得上千军万马齐动手，各路英雄显奇能。
    朵朵皆辛苦
    说起来也稀罕，安丰人民公社今年的棉花长得实在惊人，五万二千亩棉田每亩平均要收籽棉一千斤左右。这样的大丰收别说年轻人没见过，种了一辈子庄稼的老模范丁心纯和植棉能手丁凤英，连做梦也梦不到这般好的棉花。丁凤英分明记得去年的棉花一般高二尺多，最多高三尺，一株结五、六个桃算好的了。今年的棉花一般高五尺，最高的有七、八尺，最多的一株结一百多棉桃。去年凤英摘棉花弯下腰摘，摘半天腰就酸得直不起来；今年，棉花要仰了脸摘才行。
    得到这样的大丰收自然不容易。3月天，六十九岁的老英雄丁心纯跳到结了冰凌的水里，把水拦到地里浇了种棉花；6月天，火热的阳光下，凤英带着妇女们挨着枝头治虫，“六六六”、“滴滴涕”的药水熏得人要发晕，汗水直滴在棉花枝上。然后又是浇水、追肥、打尖、整枝。公社一万多男女劳力忙了一个春天又一个夏天，像侍弄孩子似地亲手侍弄着每一株棉花。这丰收的朵朵棉花，凝结了多少人的辛苦。
    熟透了的棉花急等人摘下来，公社连续组织了二次抢收棉花的大战役。只是摘了一遍，枝头又是白花花的一片。今天是第三次战役了。紧挨着丁凤英连队的是张家庄的第九连。这一连六十多人几乎全是妇女，她们心灵手巧，棉花摘得又干净又快。走在最前面的是三十六岁的董第只，只见她两手掐住花蒂轻轻一转，成捧的棉花落在她的围裙里。那雪白柔润的棉花，一团团挂在枝头，那么光滑，那么惹人喜爱，就像她刚生四个月的儿子小幸福的小脸蛋似的。董第只有三个女儿，直到今年7月建公社时才生了一个儿子。她禁不住满心欢喜，给儿子取名幸福。小幸福生来就是幸福，生下来就有托儿所的老奶奶带着，会吃、会笑，长得白胖胖地，使母亲毫无牵挂地下地。去年这时候，董第只一人带三个孩子，忙着地里又顾不上家里，身在地里心在家里，一天只能摘七、八十斤花。如今小幸福待在托儿所，九岁的大女儿密珍和七岁的二女儿凤英在上小学，吃饭睡觉都在学校，三岁的云珍在幼儿园，孩子爸爸在钢铁厂轻易不回家。她自己在劳力食堂吃饭，没啥惦记，只顾干活，一天能摘下一百八十多斤。
    小英雄助战
    公社的共产主义第二小学的学生，一边摘棉花一边在歌唱。孩子们展开了竞赛。七岁的凤珍超过了八岁的秀琴，九岁的密珍又赶过了八岁的素琴。她们的小围裙里装满了棉花，送到地头，慌忙又赶回摘棉，一上午密珍和素琴都摘了二十多斤。她们都是一、二年级的小学生，从一记事就在公社的土地上，用自己的双手给集体增添财富，把劳动当作光荣豪迈的事业。看她们的小眼睛羡慕地注视着密珍脖子上的绿围巾。那是密珍妈妈董第只摘棉多快得的奖品。在十三岁的陈小花头上也扎着同样的一块头巾，那是她在上次摘棉比赛中得的奖品。小花是个能干的小姑娘。她爹七十多岁不能很好劳动，她家还有弟弟、妹妹，她娘怕顾不上生活没有让她上学，就在家参加劳动，用她稚嫩的双手帮助年老的爹娘担负起一家生活的重担。她是个懂事的小姑娘，只得压下内心想上学的热望，跟着兄弟认几个字。直到公社成立，她爹进了幸福院，她娘上了炼铁厂，公社又供她上学。十三岁的她，才第一次背上书包，和七岁的妹妹一起上学。但她非常聪明，进学校上二年级，一个月后又插三年级。她不仅学习好，劳动更出色，总是当模范。难怪孩子们总是这么羡慕她又喜欢她。现在她双手飞快地摘着棉花，一天摘了十五斤。
    棉花堆成山
    是谁扛着那二百多斤的棉花飞跑，是谁收一百七、八十斤的棉花像小山似地压在背上？这是刚从朝鲜归国的志愿军。他们背包上还带着异国的风尘，一踏上祖国的土地，马上赶来帮助家乡的亲人抢收棉花。
    他们在去朝鲜的时候，家中还是单干户和互助组，棉花每亩只收四十多斤，而现在他们刚过鸭绿江，火车就奔驰在公社的土地上。他们觉也不睡，睁大了眼看，只觉得眼睛不够使唤。看起来那路途有些不像出国时经过的路途，那车站也不像出国时看到的车站。一路上那么多工厂，那么多烟囱。那烧红了半边天的是几千、几万座土高炉，祖国遍地在流钢水，流铁水。看了怎能不兴奋！而一到安阳，就是一望无际的棉田长得比人还高，满眼银花怒放，放下背包就想摘棉花，只恨自己满身的劲使得不够，比不上大跃进中的祖国人民。战士们就是带着这等心情一个赛一个，个个小老虎似地抬起、扛起一、二百斤重的棉花飞跑。有些干脆将一小座棉花山，学朝鲜老百姓的样子顶在头上。
    加工厂里那十来亩大的广场上，不一会就堆满了一堆堆的棉花，愈堆愈高，广场上就矗立起一座座棉花山。那雪白的棉花，在阳光下白得耀眼，宛如美丽的银花。而志愿军战士、学生、工人、棉花姑娘、钢铁姑娘、机关干部……，还在不住地背着棉花送来，愈来愈多。满院子都是人，满院子都是歌声、笑声，他们笑着，唱着，将那一包包棉花堆高起来，堆成一座座银色的山。
