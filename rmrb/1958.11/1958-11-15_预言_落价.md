    "Prophecies" Decline in Value
  　Wang Ziye
    Not long ago, Mr. Dulles made a shocking "prophecy" at a press conference in Washington, saying that the Soviet Union, China, and the rest of the socialist countries would collapse in a few decades. We have heard this kind of "prophecy" more than once. As early as the initial victory of the Soviet revolution, many "prophets" appeared, all "prophesying" that the Soviet system would not last long and would be finished in a few months. Unfortunately, forty-one years have passed, and the Soviet system is living better and better, and more countries have adopted this system.
    The words of the "prophets" have gone bankrupt. Those who know shame have shut their mouths. But some thick-skinned fellows refuse to give up and insist on "prophesying" once or twice more.
    This time, the dignified American Secretary of State personally came forward, and the deadline for the "prophecy" of collapse was greatly extended, from a few months to several decades. This can be considered extremely generous. Thank goodness, the American masters are still letting us live for a few more decades.
    However, people can't help but sweat for the Secretary of State, what if communism doesn't collapse in a few decades? At that time, the president or someone else will probably have to "prophesy" again, and will have to extend the deadline for the collapse further.
    It is not surprising that Dulles made such a "prophecy," because the United States is currently experiencing a serious economic crisis, and all stocks are falling in price, how can "prophecies" be an exception!

    “预言”落价
  　王子野
    杜勒斯老爷不久以前在华盛顿记者招待会上作了惊人的“预言”，说苏联、中国以及其余的社会主义国家再过几十年都要崩溃。这种“预言”，我们已经不只听到一次了。还在苏联革命胜利之初期，就出现了不少的“预言家”，都“预言”苏维埃制度活不久，不过几个月就会完蛋。倒霉得很，四十一年过去了，苏维埃制度活得越来越好，而且更多的国家都实行了这种制度。
    “预言家”的话都破产了。知羞的人都闭着嘴不讲了。可是有些厚脸皮的家伙不肯服输，一次、两次还要“预言”下去。
    这一回是堂堂的美国国务卿亲自出马，“预言”崩溃的期限大大放宽，由几个月变为几十年。可谓优待之至。谢天谢地，美国老爷们还让我们再活上几十年。
    可是人们不免为国务卿老爷捏一把汗，再过几十年，共产主义还不崩溃怎么办呢？那时候大概只好由总统或者别的什么再“预言”一次，并且不得不把崩溃的期限再放宽。
    杜勒斯作这样的“预言”是不稀奇的，因为美国目前正碰着严重的经济危机，一切股票都落价，“预言”何能例外！
