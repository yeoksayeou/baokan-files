    UN General Assembly Passes Resolution
    Eighty-One Nations to Participate in Disarmament Committee
    US Attempt to Continue Holding the Committee is Thwarted
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th New York Dispatch: Last night, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously passed (seventy-eight votes to zero, with two abstentions) the joint proposal by India and Yugoslavia to expand the membership of the Disarmament Committee to eighty-one nations in 1959, that is, to establish a Disarmament Committee with the participation of all United Nations member states.
    The resolution pointed out that the establishment of a Disarmament Committee with the participation of eighty-one nations would enable all member states of the United Nations to contribute to the progress of world disarmament. The resolution also stipulates that the committee will begin its work in accordance with the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, but that it may subsequently formulate its own rules of procedure.
    As everyone knows, because the United Nations Disarmament Committee and its subcommittees, in which Western countries have a majority, have become tools of the West and a means of dealing with public opinion, the Soviet Union announced its withdrawal from these organizations last year and suggested the separate establishment of a permanent disarmament committee with the participation of all members of the United Nations to assume responsibility for disarmament negotiations. However, the United States and its partners rejected the Soviet proposal and manipulated the United Nations to pass a six-nation proposal last year to unilaterally expand the Disarmament Committee, so that the majority of the newly added members of the Disarmament Committee were still participants in the military blocs under the control of the United States. It is believed that the aforementioned resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly is undoubtedly a blow to the conspiracy of the United States and its partners to continue to hold the United Nations Disarmament Committee.

    联合国大会通过决议
    八十一国参加裁军委员会
    美国企图继续把持委员会的阴谋受到打击
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：昨天晚上联合国大会会议一致通过（七十八票对零票，两票弃权）印度和南斯拉夫联合提出的在1959年把裁军委员会成员国扩大为八十一国，即成立有联合国全体成员国参加的裁军委员会的建议。
    这个决议指出，成立由八十一国参加的裁军委员会就可以使联合国所有成员国能够对世界裁军问题的进展作出贡献。决议还规定，委员会根据大会规程开始进行工作，但随后它可以制定自己的程序规则。
    大家知道，由于西方国家占多数的联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会已经成为西方的工具和应付舆论的手段，苏联在去年宣布退出这些组织，而建议另行成立由联合国所有成员国参加的常设裁军委员会来负担起裁军谈判的责任。但是美国和它的伙伴拒绝了苏联的建议，而操纵联合国在去年通过了片面扩大裁军委员会的六国提案，从而使新增加的裁军委员会的成员大多数仍然是美国操纵下的军事集团的参加国。人们认为，目前联合国大会通过的上述决议无疑是对美国和它的伙伴企图继续把持联合国裁军委员会的阴谋的一个打击。
