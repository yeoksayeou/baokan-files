“Henan People” (Short Story)
                                        Ji Xuepei

Our place borders Xichuan County, Henan; the story happened right on this border.

It was not long ago, when the whole county was going all out for steelmaking. Our commune sent Cui Xiaoji to Yuezhen to have a look, and when he came back, he led us to build furnaces overnight.

Before starting, everyone discussed it and decided to build our earthen furnace group at Black Mountain Pass. Because it was a vital road junction, close to the mountain, making it convenient for transporting ore and burning charcoal.

So, we worked for a whole day, transporting all kinds of materials needed for building the furnace there. After dinner, our contingent marched mightily to Black Mountain Pass.

Zhang Bingwang, the manager of the Joint Operations Center, came out to greet us. He smiled happily and said, "Welcome, welcome! You building the furnace here will surely add to our business."

Cui Lao Han from our commune chimed in, "You really know how to calculate business. When we come to make steel in the future, we'll bring our quilts and grain, not eating or staying in a shop, what will you have to look forward to?"

At this moment, we had already hung the four gas lamps we brought on the trees, and the bright white light illuminated Black Mountain Pass like daylight.

We were divided into nine groups in total, with Cui Xiaoji as the chief technician, responsible for command. After each group selected the location for building the furnace, Cui Xiaoji helped measure the size of the furnace foundation, and everyone started working at it, some moving bricks, some transporting blanks... Several older people acted as furnace builders.

Because steelmaking was about to begin soon, everyone was really happy. Talking, laughing, singing, making noise... Especially those young men moving bricks and transporting blanks, running with bricks in their arms, constantly shouting "Woo--hey! Woo--hey!"--as if they had so much strength they couldn't use up, and had to shout like that to feel satisfied. One person shouted, and everyone followed, making the mountain pass seem like a battlefield.

Cui Xiaoji was of course even busier. Clutching a small notebook, he ran around like his feet weren't touching the ground. "Cui Xiaoji, come see if we built it right!" someone shouted here. "Cui Xiaoji, how high and wide should the 'tap hole' be?" someone shouted there. Cui Xiaoji chased the shouts in circles, and in a short time, sweat was dripping from his nose.

"Hey! I really have to make a suggestion to the commune director!" Cui Xiaoji said as he ran back and forth, "I said at the time to send a few more people to learn, but he said, you can go alone. Look now, wouldn't it be good to have a few more people? ... Hey! The 'air inlet' is too high, it only needs to be eight points higher than the 'slag outlet'. ... Right, right!"

Hearing Cui Xiaoji complain, several people chuckled. Cui Lao Han shouted at his son, "What nonsense are you talking about, are you taking credit? Just move your legs faster!"

Our group was the southernmost. When it came to building the "air inlet," Cui Lao Han and his brother Cui Shitou started arguing.

Cui Lao Han said to his brother, "You built the 'air inlet' too high!"

Cui Shitou insisted that it was just right. Cui Lao Han was unconvinced, stood up with a huff, stretched his neck, and turned his head to look for Xiaoji everywhere.

Just then, someone behind us asked with a smile, "How tall are you building this furnace?"

Everyone heard an unfamiliar accent. Looking back, we saw a thin, energetic old man standing behind us.

Cui Lao Han sized him up; Cui Shitou squatted on the ground, building while answering, "Six feet five."

The old man smiled, bent down and compared it with his hand, and said to Cui Shitou, "Brother, it's a bit too high; for a furnace six feet four or five tall, the 'air inlet' only needs to be two and seven or eight inches higher than the 'tap hole'."

As he was saying this, I saw several unfamiliar voices talking beside the other furnaces. I looked, and it was really strange! Where did so many new faces come from?

When Cui Lao Han saw that this old man supported his opinion, he was obviously very proud. His beard twitched, and he asked with a smile, "Old brother, where is your home?"

The old man smiled and said, "Henan people."

This surprised us: How did Henan people run to Hubei in the middle of the night?

The old man looked at our expressions and quickly said with a smile, "We are from Xichuan, here to pick ore from you, look," he pointed with his chin, "we live in this Joint Operations Center."

When he said this, we all laughed. So it turned out they were old neighbors!

Cui Lao Han asked with a smile, "Old brother, can you build furnaces too?"

The Henan guest quickly said with a smile, "I can't say I can build them. However, I often fiddle with this stuff at home." As he said this, he rolled up his sleeves and was about to start working.

Cui Shitou quickly stopped him and said, "Hey, let us do it; you've been traveling all day, you must be tired."

The old man reached out and took the trowel, laughing, "Tired of what! I can't sleep even if I go to bed early."

"Tsk! What good spirit!" Cui Lao Han happily asked, "How old are you, old brother?"

"Fifty-three."

"Yo! We are the same age." Cui Lao Han tilted his head and smiled, smearing mud on the blank and asking, "Doesn't Xichuan County produce ore?"

"How could it not!" The old man took the blank from Cui Lao Han's hand, carefully placed it, pressed it hard, and then knocked it with a trowel, laughing, "It's just that it's a bit far from our place, it's not as convenient as coming over to pick it."

Cui Shitou chimed in, "We don't lack this stuff in our mountains. Just pick a piece on the mountain, and you can be sure it's iron ore."

"Good place, good place!" The old man nodded with a smile.

Cui Shitou continued, "There's really no way. If we had Yang Erlang's mountain-driving whip, we would drive two mountains over for you, so you wouldn't have to climb slopes and ridges to pick it."

This made everyone laugh...

Everyone talked and worked, and I don't know how much time passed, anyway, the furnace had been built more than half a person high. Cui Lao Han quickly nudged the old man and laughed, "I say, old brother! You have to travel tomorrow, so, hurry up and call your people, and ask them to go back and rest."

"What's the hurry?" The old man kept working without stopping and said, "We are all working people, who can't catch up on sleep?" He paused and then continued, "To tell you the truth, we had already gone to bed. Everyone heard that you were building furnaces here; and hearing that you didn't know how, so we discussed it and everyone got up; you say, isn't your work our work? If we don't help you build the furnace, can we sleep peacefully?"

Cui Lao Han happily said, "That's the truth; farmers all over the world are one family."

"No doubt about it!" The old man said excitedly, "In the past, we just said so, but now we are really one family. Think about it, in the past, could we have run to your Hubei to pick ore?"

Cui Lao Han laughed, "Now even if you move our mountains away, we have no objection."

For a long time, we didn't hear Cui Xiaoji shouting. Suddenly, the people on the furnace next to us all laughed, and half of the laughter was the loud voice of the sturdy Henan people. ... [Zhao Zhifang Illustration]

    “河南人”（小小说）
    吉学霈
    我们这地方，跟河南淅川县临边搭界；故事也就出在这上头。
    那是前不久的事，全县各处都正在大闹钢铁哩。我们社里派崔小纪跑到岳镇看了看，回来就连夜领着我们垒炉子。
    未动手以前，大家商量了一下，决定把我们的土炉群垒到黑山垭。因为那里是个要道口，离山也近，运矿石烧木炭都方便。
  就这样，我们干了一整天，把垒炉子所需用的各种材料都运去了。吃罢晚饭，我们的人马浩浩荡荡的开到了黑山垭。
    联营馆的经理张秉旺，跑出来迎接我们。他乐和和的笑着说：“欢迎欢迎！你们把炉子垒到这里，可要给我们添生意了。”
    我们社里的崔老汉接过来说：“你真会念生意经。我们将来来炼铁，被子、粮食全带着，一不吃饭，二不住店，看你还有个啥盼头？”
    这当儿，我们已将带来的四盏汽灯挂到树上了，雪白铮亮的灯光，把个黑山垭照得如同白昼。
    我们一共分成九个组，由崔小纪当总技术员，负责指挥。各组把建炉的地点选择以后，崔小纪又帮着把炉基的尺寸量了量，大伙就七手八脚的干起来。有的搬砖，有的运坯……几个年岁稍大的人，就充当砌炉工人。
    因为不久就要开始炼铁了，大伙心里实在高兴。说呀，笑呀，唱呀，闹呀……特别是那些搬砖运坯的小伙子们，一路抱着砖块飞跑，还不住声的扯起嗓子“呜——嘿！呜——嘿”——大叫，就好像他们身上有多少气力使不出来，非这样叫叫才过瘾似的。一个叫，大伙都跟着叫，闹的这个山垭子里面，真像是排开了战场。
    崔小纪当然更成忙人了。手里攥着个小本本，跑起来脚不挨地。这里喊：“崔小纪，来看看俺们砌的对不对？”那里喊：“崔小纪，‘出铁口’倒底多高多宽呀？”崔小纪撵着喊声团团转，只一阵工夫，鼻尖上就冒汗了。
    “嗨！我真得给社主任提条意见！”崔小纪转来转去的跑着说：“当时我说多去几个人学习吧，他说，你一个人去就行了。看这会，要多有几个人好不好？……嗳！‘进风眼’垒高了，比‘出碴口’高八分就行。……对对！”
    听见崔小纪发牢骚，有几个人嘿嘿笑了。崔老汉嚷他孩子说：“讲啥怪话，有功了是不是？两条腿放快些不就得啦！”
    我们这一组，最靠南边了。临到砌“进风眼”的时候，崔老汉跟他兄弟崔石头争执开了。
    崔老汉说他兄弟：“你把‘进风眼’砌高了！”
    崔石头却坚持说，恰好。崔老汉心里不服气，霍地一声站起来，脖子一伸，转着头到处找小纪。
    正在这时候，我们背后一个人笑着问：“你们垒这炉子几尺高？”
    大家一听是生腔口。回头一看，我们背后站着一个瘦棱棱的，满有精神的高老头。
    崔老汉闪着眼把他上下打量了一番；崔石头在地上蹲着，一边砌，一边回答：“六尺五。”
    那高老头笑了笑，弯腰用手一比，对崔石头说：“老弟，是太高了些；六尺四、五高的炉子，‘进风眼’比‘出铁口’高二寸七、八就行了。”
    他正说这话的时候，我见其他几个炉子旁边，也有几个生腔口在说话。我一看，真奇！从哪来了这么多生脸呢？
    崔老汉一见这个高老头支持了自己的意见，显然心里很得意。胡子噘，笑咪咪的问：“你这位老哥，家是那里的？”
    那老头笑着说：“河南人。”
    这一说，可教我们吃了一惊：河南人怎么半夜跑到湖北来了。
    那老头看看我们的神情，连忙笑着说：“俺们是淅川的，来你们这里挑矿石，呶，”他回头用下巴一指：“就住在这个联营馆里。”
    这一说，我们都笑了。原来是老邻居呀！
    崔老汉笑着问：“老哥，你也会垒炉子吗？”
    河南客连忙笑着说：“说不上会垒。不过，在家都常摆调这玩艺。”一边说着，卷起袖子就要干。
    崔石头连忙拦住说：“嗳，我们来；你们跑一天啦，够乏困哩。
    那老头一伸手接过瓦刀来，笑道：“乏困啥！睡早了也睡不着。”
    “啧！真好精神！”崔老汉喜的问：“你老哥多大年纪？”
    “五十三。”
    “哟！咱俩人同岁。”崔老汉歪着头笑了笑，往坯上抿着泥问道：“咱淅川县不产矿石吗？”
    “怎么不产！”那老头接着崔老汉手里的土坯，小心依依的放上去，又吃力捺了捺，然后用瓦刀一敲，笑道：“就是离我们那里远些，还不如过来挑着方便。”
    崔石头接上说：“我们这山野地方，这家伙可不缺。上山随便摸一块，一睁眼保险准是铁矿石。”
    “好地方，好地方！”那老头笑着直点头。
    崔石头又接着说：“真是没办法。要有杨二郎的赶山鞭，就给你们赶两架山去，也省得你们爬坡沿岭的过来挑了。”
    这一说，引的大家直笑。……
    大伙说着干着，也不知过了多大时候，反正炉子已经砌起半人多高了。崔老汉连忙碰了碰那老头笑道：“我说，老哥呀！你们明天还得赶路哩，呐，快招呼招呼你们的人，都请回去歇息吧。”
    “慌啥哩？”那老头不停手的干着说：“都是做活人嘛，谁还不能赶个乏困？”停了停，又接着说：“说实话，刚才我们已睡下了。大家一听，你们在这垒炉子；又听着，大家还不怎么会，于是我们一商量大家都爬了起来；你说，你们的活，还不就是我们的活吗？要是不帮你们把炉子垒起来，俺们能睡安稳吗？”
    崔老汉喜的说：“这么说，可也是实情；天下农民是一家嘛。”
    “这不含糊！”那老头兴冲冲的说：“往日只是这么说，这会可真是一家人了。你想想，要搁过去，俺们能跑到你们湖北来挑矿石？”
    崔老汉笑道：“现在你们就是把俺们的山搬走俺们也没意见。”
    好半天，不听崔小纪喊叫了。突然，我们挨边那座炉子上的人，不知为什么全都哈哈笑起来，这笑声里边，有一半是河南硬朗朗的高嗓门。……　　〔赵志方插图〕
