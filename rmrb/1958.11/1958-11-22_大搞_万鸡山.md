Vigorously Develop "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain"
A commentator from this newspaper

Since this spring, an abnormal phenomenon has occurred in poultry production: young chicks are not selling well in various places, and the large-scale slaughter and blind sale of poultry are very common, so that the nation's poultry has not only failed to continue to grow but has actually seriously declined in many areas. This is a situation worth noting.

The vast majority of poultry used to be raised privately. Since the beginning of this spring, the nation's rural areas have been vigorously grasping industrial and agricultural production, and the labor force has been unprecedentedly strained. Especially after the people's communes were established, the conditions for private breeding have changed. Commune members' families' time, feed sources, and the addition of poultry-raising equipment have all been limited to a certain extent, thus reducing the number of privately raised poultry. This is the objective reason for the decline in poultry production. It reflects that with the development of rural collective life, the method of raising poultry based on individual households is no longer adapted to the current situation of high-speed production development. In the future, it is necessary to vigorously develop collective poultry farming alongside family poultry farming in order to rapidly increase poultry production and meet the growing needs of all parties for poultry and eggs.

Are there conditions for developing collective poultry farming? Yes. The news of the achievements of the Hingtang Koutou Town and the Beijing Eastern Suburb Farm in collective chicken raising, published in this newspaper today, is a powerful proof. The realization of the people's communes has matured the conditions for vigorously developing collective poultry farming: whether in terms of personnel, funds, equipment, or the adoption of scientific feeding management methods, it is far beyond what individual households can compare. At present, the vigorous development of collective poultry farming by the people's communes is an inevitable trend of "when water flows, a channel is formed."

However, some cadres and masses have not recognized this objective situation and favorable conditions. They do not actively develop collective poultry farming, but only see that poultry is difficult to manage and often tramples on crops and pecks at seedlings. They have adopted methods of hitting chickens and ducks and limiting or prohibiting raising them. They believe that raising chickens and ducks is in conflict with planting crops and do not advocate raising them. Of course, it is not good for raising poultry to trample on crops, which is a contradiction. But raising poultry can also avoid trampling on crops. Koutou Town used barren mountains to create a "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain", which is a good solution to this contradiction, isn't it? If we are all afraid of trampling on crops and prohibit raising chickens, wouldn't poultry become extinct in another year or two? This is a case of "throwing out the baby with the bathwater."

Some people believe that raising poultry is important, but emphasize that collective raising lacks equipment, has no experience, and is prone to infectious diseases, so they conclude that it is "difficult to do on a large scale." This view is also incorrect. The experience of Koutou Town's "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain" proves that collective poultry farming can adapt to local conditions and make full use of all natural conditions. Mountainous areas can use hills and grasslands to develop "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountains" and "Ten Thousand Chicken Slopes"; plains can use wasteland and forests to develop "Ten Thousand Chicken Beaches" and "Ten Thousand Chicken Forests"; low-lying areas can also use lakes and ponds to develop duck and goose flocks. As for the lack of equipment, there are also solutions. Koutou Town implemented the principle of using local materials and being simple and crude. Without using a single brick or piece of glass, they only used some bamboo, adobe, and other materials to build a large number of chicken coops. It can be seen that collective poultry farming is not "difficult to do on a large scale," but rather can be done on a large scale.

Some people believe that if we want to raise more poultry, it will definitely waste a lot of grain, "a bushel of rice feeds a pound of chicken," which is not cost-effective. In fact, this is not the case. Chickens are omnivorous animals and do not only eat grain. Koutou Town's "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain" has made every effort to find and utilize various aquatic and wild animals and plants as substitute feed, mixed with a certain proportion of refined feed, and still raised chickens that are fat and strong.

Of course, some specific issues of collective poultry farming, such as the supply of hatching eggs, the establishment of hatcheries and poultry farms, and the training of breeding personnel, must also be well resolved. In this regard, commercial departments should provide as much assistance as possible to the people's communes. While developing collective poultry farming, the current individual poultry farmers should not be restricted, and they should also be given appropriate arrangements and supplied with a portion of feed. Doing so is beneficial to the development of poultry production.

Raising poultry is a small matter compared to steelmaking, iron smelting, and water conservancy construction. Precisely because it is a small matter, it is often easily overlooked. However, poultry and eggs are in great demand for people's livelihood and foreign trade, and we cannot completely abandon them. Therefore, it is necessary for all localities to plan for collective poultry farming and allocate appropriate manpower and resources to quickly get this matter done.

    大搞“万鸡山”
    本报评论员
    今年春天以来，家禽生产出现了反常的现象：各地幼雏滞销，大量宰杀和盲目出售家禽的现象很普遍，以致全国的家禽不仅没有继续增长，在不少地区反而严重减产。这是一个值得注意的情况。
    家禽的绝大部分过去都是私人喂养的。由于今春以来全国农村大抓工农业生产，劳动力空前紧张，特别是人民公社化以后，私人喂养条件发生了变化，社员家庭养禽的时间、饲料来源和养禽设备的添置，都受到了一定的限制，因而私人喂养家禽的数量下降。这就是造成家禽减产的客观原因。它反映了随着农村集体生活的发展，以一家一户为主的饲养家禽的方法已经不能和当前高速度发展生产的形势相适应了。今后，必须大规模地发展集体养禽事业和家庭养禽并举，才能迅速提高家禽生产，满足各方面对禽、蛋日益增长的需要。
    发展集体养禽事业有没有条件呢？有。今天本报发表的行唐口头镇、北京东郊农场集体养鸡成绩的新闻，就是有力的证明。人民公社化的实现，使大搞集体养禽事业的条件成熟了：不论在人员、资金、设备以及采用科学的饲养管理方法方面，都是一家一户分散养禽所远不能比拟的。目前人民公社大力发展集体养禽事业，已经是“水到渠成”的必然趋势了。
    但是有些干部和群众并没有认清这一客观形势和有利条件，他们不去积极地发展集体养禽事业，而只看到家禽不好管理，常常践踏庄稼、啄食幼苗，曾采取了打鸡打鸭、限养禁养的办法。他们认为养鸡养鸭和种庄稼有矛盾，不主张养。养家禽要践踏庄稼当然不好，这是个矛盾。但是养家禽也可以不践踏庄稼。口头镇利用荒山搞起“万鸡山”，不是很好地解决了这个矛盾吗？如果我们都怕践踏庄稼而禁止养鸡，再过一两年，家禽岂不要绝种了么？这是因噎废食的办法。
    有人虽然认为养禽很重要，但是强调集体饲养缺乏设备，又没有经验，又容易传染疫病，因而得出的结论是“难以大搞”。这种看法也是不正确的。口头镇“万鸡山”的经验证明：集体养禽可以因地制宜，充分利用一切自然条件。山区可以利用山丘草坡发展“万鸡山”“万鸡坡”；平原可以利用荒滩、树林发展“万鸡滩”“万鸡林”；低洼地区还可以利用湖泊池沼发展鸭群鹅群。至于设备不足也是有办法解决的。口头镇实行了就地取材、因陋就简的方针，没用一块砖、一块玻璃，只用了一些竹子、土坯等就建成了大批鸡舍。可见集体养禽不是“难以大搞”，而是很可以大搞。
    有一些人认为，既要多养家禽，就一定会浪费大量的粮食，“斗米喂斤鸡”，不合算。其实不然。鸡是杂食性的动物，不是只吃粮食的。口头镇办“万鸡山”，就是多方设法寻找和利用各种水生和野生动、植物作为代饲料，渗以一定比例的精饲料，一样把鸡喂得又肥又壮。
    当然，对集体养禽的一些具体问题，如供应种蛋、建立孵化场和养禽场、训练饲养人员等，也要很好地解决。在这方面，商业部门应尽量给人民公社以协助。在发展集体养禽的同时，对于目前的个体养禽户也不应当限制，并且还应该给以适当的安排，供应一部分饲料给他们。这样做是有利于发展家禽生产的。
    养家禽和炼钢炼铁、兴修水利比起来，是小事情。也正因为是小事情，就常常容易被人忽略。但是，禽、蛋是人民生活和对外贸易大量需要的东西，不能把它完全丢开不管。因此，各个地方有必要对集体养禽事业规划一下，并抽出适当的人力和物力，迅速地把这件事情办起来。
