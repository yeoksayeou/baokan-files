    Love Labor and Disregard Remuneration, Emphasize Collaboration and Self-Sacrifice
    The Working Class Possesses a Noble Style
    New People and New Events Abound in Jianhua, Qinghua, and Other Factories
    (Our Qiqihar Dispatch, November 20th) Reporter Kang Weizhong and Wang Baoxin report: After the rectification campaign and the promotion of the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" experience, the communist ideology of the workers and staff of the state-owned Jianhua Machinery Factory, Qinghua Tool Factory, and Hua'an Machinery Factory has greatly increased. A new atmosphere of "everyone talking about communism and everything being done for communism" has emerged in the factories.
    The communist style of the workers in these three factories is first manifested in their selfless work attitude, disregarding remuneration. They took the initiative to propose abolishing the piece-rate wage system, refusing overtime pay and bonuses, yet their output doubled. Wang Wanrui and others, workers in the Sixth Workshop of Hua'an Machinery Factory, painstakingly researched and improved the "high-pressure oil pump connecting rod," increasing production efficiency by 3,360 times; when the factory wanted to award them a bonus, they firmly refused. The Twenty-first Workshop, as an excellent unit in the factory, was given a bonus of 1,000 yuan by the factory, but the workers refused and returned it. The workers said: "Hard work is for building socialism, not for bonuses." After this factory abolished the piece-rate wage system, production in the third quarter increased by 27% compared to the original plan.
    After the employees liberated their minds and eliminated their inferiority complex, the communist style of daring to think and daring to act was greatly promoted. Jianhua and Hua'an factories both established "Red Flag Academies of Sciences" in their workshops, where thousands of workers, cadres, and technicians engaged in various scientific research work. Because the research topics came from production practice and the masses, basically everyone had a research topic and everyone was doing scientific research. Everyone's enthusiasm for marching towards science and technology was very high. Since the establishment of the "Academy of Sciences" in the Eighth Workshop of Jianhua Machinery Factory, in just two months, it has put forward more than 27,000 rationalization proposals centered on improving production and improving enterprise management, of which more than 16,000 have been implemented. Employees also manufactured many simple equipment, such as vertical lathes, grinders, and semi-automatic hangers, which effectively promoted production.
    The ideas of mutual cooperation, mutual support, selflessness, and serving the public have grown in these factories, and a brand-new relationship is emerging between people. Many workers with higher incomes voluntarily took out a portion of their wages to help workers and apprentices with financial difficulties; night shift workers helped day shift workers buy rice and coal during the day. When workshops and teams at the Jianhua Machinery Factory encountered difficulties in production and needed support from others, as long as they wrote it on the blackboard, other teams or workshops would automatically send the best and strongest people to help. For example, the slogans of the workshops and teams are: "Respond to every request," "Welcome all comers," and "Deliver goods to your door." Some teams in the Qinghua Tool Factory established "assault team production signal stations." When there were difficulties in completing production tasks, they would send out a signal, and other teams would send workers to support them and help solve the difficulties. This communist spirit of cooperation is not only manifested within the factory but also between factories. For example, the sand casting task of Jianhua Machinery Factory was very tight, but in order to support key projects, it transferred key pattern-making technicians to support Heilongjiang Heavy Machinery Factory for one hundred workdays.
    In these three factories, the communist moral qualities of the employees are flourishing. Now, these factories have implemented mass self-management systems in various aspects. For example, Jianhua's "Six Selfs" are: self-calculation and self-withdrawal of wages, self-collection and self-delivery of tools, self-collection and self-delivery of materials, self-use, self-collection, and self-management of labor protection equipment, etc.; the "Fourteen Nos" are: no one selling food, no one managing savings, no one managing mutual aid funds, no one selling movie tickets, no one issuing newspapers and magazines, etc. The vast majority of employees consciously abide by these systems. Until now, not only has there not been any phenomenon of losing money or taking more tools and materials, but also because employees consciously take care of public property, they have saved a lot of money for the country. This moral quality of the workers has had a positive impact on society. When the workers of Jianhua Machinery Factory participated in the voluntary labor of repairing the embankment in the city, the two old men selling cut cakes nearby also implemented "no one selling cut cakes" to them. They sold more than two hundred catties every day for a month without any difference. The two old men selling cut cakes said with emotion: "No wonder outsiders are praising the good moral style of Jianhua workers, it is truly well-deserved!"

    爱劳动不计报酬  重协作舍己为人
    工人阶级风格高尚
    建华庆华等工厂新人新事多
    本报齐齐哈尔20日电　记者康伟中、王宝馨报道：经过整风运动和两参一改三结合经验的推行，国营建华机械厂、庆华工具厂、华安机械厂的职工共产主义思想大为高涨。工厂里出现了“人人谈共产主义，事事为共产主义”的新风气。
    这三个厂工人们的共产主义风格，首先表现在不计报酬忘我的劳动态度上。他们主动提出废除计件工资制，不要加班费和奖金，产量却成倍增加。华安机械厂六车间工人王万瑞等苦心钻研改进了“高压油泵连杆”，提高生产效率三千三百六十倍；厂里要发奖金，他们坚决不接受。作为全厂优秀单位的二十一车间，工厂发给他们一千元奖金，工人们拒绝接受，退了回去。工人们说：“苦战是为了建设社会主义，不是为了奖金。”这个厂在废除计件工资以后，第三季度生产比原计划提高27％。
    职工们在解放思想，打掉自卑感以后，敢想、敢干的共产主义风格大大发扬。建华、华安两厂都在车间里成立了“红旗科学院”，成千的工人、干部和技术人员在“科学院”里从事各种科学研究工作。由于研究题目是从生产实际和群众中来的，基本上做到了人人有研究题目，人人作科学研究。大家向科学技术进军的积极性很高。建华机械厂八车间从成立“科学院”以来，仅两个月的时间，就提出了以提高生产和改善企业管理为中心的合理化建议两万七千多条，目前已经实现一万六千多条。职工们还制造了许多简易设备，如立式车床、磨床、半自动吊床等，有力地推动了生产。
    互相协作、互相支援、大公无私、舍己为公的思想，在这些厂里成长起来了，人与人之间呈现着一种崭新的关系。许多收入多的工人自动拿出一部分工资帮助生活有困难的工人和徒工；夜班工人白天帮助白班工人买米、买煤。建华机械厂各车间和小组在生产上遇到困难需要别人支援的时候，只要在黑板上写一下，别的小组或车间就自动派最好最强的人来支援。如车间和小组的口号是：“有求必应”、“来者不拒”、“送货上门”。庆华工具厂有的小组建立了“突击队生产信号站”，当生产任务完成有困难时就发出信号，其他小组就派工人支援他们，帮助解决困难。这种共产主义协作精神不仅表现在厂内，而且表现在工厂与工厂之间。例如，建华机械厂翻砂任务非常紧张，但是为了支援重点工程，调出主要木型技术人员支援黑龙江重型机器厂一百个劳动日。
    这三个厂里，职工的共产主义道德品质蓬勃成长。现在，这几个厂都推行了各方面的群众自我管理的制度。例如，建华的“六自”是：自算自取工资，自取自送工具，自取自送材料，自用自取自管劳动保护用具等；“十四无”是：无人售饭菜，无人管储蓄，无人管互助金，无人售电影票，无人发报刊，等等。广大职工都自觉地遵守这些制度，直到现在，不仅没有发生任何丢钱和多拿工具、材料的现象，而且由于职工都自觉地爱护公物，还为国家节省了大量资金。工人们这种道德品质，在社会上已产生良好影响。建华机械厂的工人在参加市内修堤的义务劳动时，附近卖切糕的两位老人对他们也实行“无人售切糕”，每天卖二百多斤，一连卖了一个月，分文不差。两位卖切糕的老人感动地说：“不怪外人都夸建华工人道德风尚好，真是名不虚传！”
