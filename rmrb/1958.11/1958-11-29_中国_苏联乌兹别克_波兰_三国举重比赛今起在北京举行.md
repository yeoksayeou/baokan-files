    China, Soviet Uzbekistan, and Poland
    Three-Nation Weightlifting Competition Begins Today in Beijing

    (Our newspaper reports) The weightlifting competition between China, the Soviet Uzbekistan Republic, and Poland will be held today and tomorrow at the Beijing Gymnasium.

    All three sides are fielding their best lineups for this competition. China's participants include world record holders Chen Jingkai, Huang Qianghui, Zhao Qingkui, as well as national record holder Li Baiyu, and others. Poland has also sent its most outstanding weightlifting athletes. These include Zbigniew Zaliński, the world record holder in the snatch in the featherweight division; Jan Jankowski, who finished fourth in the flyweight division at the 1958 World and European Weightlifting Championships; Ireneusz Paliński, fourth in the middleweight division at the 16th Olympic Games; and Czesław Białas, the 1957 European champion and fourth-place finisher in the light heavyweight division at the Tehran World Weightlifting Championships. From the Soviet Uzbekistan side, there are also internationally competitive athletes like Vladimir, Kuz'Zotov, Sharipov, and Dania. Judging from the strength of the lineups, this international weightlifting competition is expected to produce many tense and exciting scenes.

    Based on the past performances of the athletes from the three countries, it is estimated that China's Chen Jingkai in the flyweight division (332.5 kg), Huang Qianghui in the lightweight division (382.5 kg), and Zhao Qingkui in the light heavyweight division (432.5 kg) have a higher chance of winning. Poland's Jankowski in the flyweight division has a record of 307.5 kg, and Uzbekistan's Vladimir's highest record is 325 kg. The records of Polish and Uzbek athletes in the lightweight division are more than 20 kg lower than Huang Qianghui's. Zhao Qingkui's record in the light heavyweight division is also higher than that of Polish and Uzbek athletes.

    Our athletes are slightly weaker in the featherweight, middleweight, and heavyweight divisions. Poland's Zaliński in the featherweight division has a record of 347.5 kg, while China's You Jiadong's record is 322.5 kg. In the middleweight division, Poland's Paliński has a record of 382.5 kg, and Uzbekistan's Kuz'Zotov and Sharipov have also achieved 382.5 kg. China's Shu Gang's best training record is around 370 kg. In the heavyweight division, Uzbekistan's Golibanov's record is 427.5 kg, Poland's Slovistsky's record is 410 kg, and China's Chang Guanqun's record is 390 kg. It is estimated that Polish and Soviet athletes will engage in intense competition in the middleweight and heavyweight divisions. In the light heavyweight division, Poland's Białas's record is 422.5 kg, and China's Li Baiyu's record is 417.5 kg. However, Li Baiyu's recent performance has improved, and his total score has also reached 422.5 kg. The light heavyweight competition is crucial to whether China can win the overall team title in this competition. Because China is more likely to win in the flyweight, lightweight, and light heavyweight divisions, if we also win in the light heavyweight division, we will have won four out of the seven weight classes. If we lose in the light heavyweight division, we may lose the overall title.

    中国　苏联乌兹别克　波兰
    三国举重比赛今起在北京举行
    本报讯　中国、苏联乌兹别克共和国和波兰三国举重比赛今明两天在北京体育馆举行。
    这次三方面都以最佳的阵容出战。中国参加这次比赛的有世界纪录创造者陈镜开、黄强辉、赵庆奎以及国家纪录保持者李白玉等。波兰这次前来的也都是波兰最优秀的举重选手。其中有次轻级抓举世界纪录创造者泽林斯基、获得1958年世界和欧洲举重锦标赛最轻级第四名的扬科夫斯基、十六届奥运会中量级第四名波赫内克和获得1957年欧洲冠军、德黑兰世界举重锦标赛第四名轻重级选手比拉斯等。在苏联乌兹别克方面也有像弗拉基米尔、库兹?佐夫、沙里波夫、达尼亚等具有国际水平的选手。从阵容看实力，可以预测，这场国际举重比赛会出现很多紧张激烈的竞争场面。
    根据三国选手过去的成绩，估计我国最轻级陈镜开（三百三十二点五公斤），轻量级黄强辉（三百八十二点五公斤），轻重级赵庆奎（四百三十二点五公斤）获胜希望较大。波兰最轻级杨科夫斯基的成绩是三百零七点五公斤，乌兹别克弗拉基米尔的最高成绩是三百二十五公斤。轻量级波兰和乌兹别克选手的成绩要比黄强辉低二十多公斤。轻重级赵庆奎的成绩也较波兰和乌兹别克选手高。
    次轻级、中量级和重量级我国选手实力略差。次轻级波兰泽林斯基成绩达到三百四十七点五公斤，我国尤家栋的成绩是三百二十二点五公斤。中量级波兰的波赫内克的成绩是三百八十二点五公斤，乌兹别克的库兹?佐夫和沙里波夫的成绩也都达到过三百八十二点五公斤，我国选手舒刚练习时最好成绩是三百七十公斤左右。重量级乌兹别克选手哥里巴诺夫成绩是四百二十七点五公斤，波兰斯洛维斯基成绩是四百一十公斤，我国常冠群的成绩是三百九十公斤。估计中量级和重量级波苏选手将展开激烈竞争。次重级波兰比拉斯的成绩是四百二十二点五公斤，我国李白玉的成绩是四百一十七点五公斤，不过，最近李白玉的成绩有提高，总成绩也到过四百二十二点五公斤。次重级比赛是我国能否获得这次比赛总分冠军的关键。因为最轻级、轻量级和轻重级我国比较有希望，如果次重级再胜了，七个级就赢了四个。如果次重级输了，就可能把冠军丢掉。
