Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 14th: A commentary published by Kyodo News on the 13th reveals that, under the fierce impact of the Japanese people's struggle against revising the "Police Duties Execution Law," Nobusuke Kishi is afraid that the Japanese people will seize the opportunity to shatter his conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," thereby shaking the foundation of his rule. Kyodo News said, "The Kishi cabinet has already suffered greatly because of the revision of the Police Duties Execution Law. If it is seriously injured again due to the revision of the Security Treaty, this will undoubtedly be a fatal blow to the Kishi cabinet."

The Nobusuke Kishi government is negotiating with the United States to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" into a "mutual defense treaty" so that Japan can act as the vanguard for U.S. military aggression in the Far East. Revising the police law is a preliminary arrangement by the Nobusuke Kishi government to suppress domestic people's opposition to this aggression plan and strengthen police rule. Kyodo News said, "Following the Police Duties Execution Law amendment issue, the issue of revising the Security Treaty will inevitably become a topic of political struggle in Japan. After this situation occurs, more and more people within the Liberal Democratic Party are advocating for cautious action. The U.S. side is also very worried about the deterioration of the domestic atmosphere in Japan."

The commentary said, "Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki said in a speech at the Socialist Party's extraordinary convention on the 12th that 'revising the Security Treaty is to prepare for nuclear war.' This statement greatly shocked Foreign Minister Fujiyama; this clearly shows that the Socialist Party is preparing to concentrate its efforts on attacking the government's revision of the Security Treaty, following the Police Duties Execution Law amendment issue." Kyodo News is very worried that the Socialist Party will "take advantage of the opportunity to oppose the government's revision of the Security Treaty to further consolidate the anti-Kishi cabinet lineup, which has been united into a national front due to opposition to the Police Duties Execution Law amendment." Kyodo News said, "Prime Minister Kishi and Foreign Minister Fujiyama completely did not expect that the issue of revising the Police Duties Execution Law would be linked to the issue of revising the Security Treaty to this extent; moreover, this situation occurred after the negotiations had been going on for quite some time, which put the government in a more embarrassing situation." The commentary said, "The U.S. side has also realized that Prime Minister Kishi and Foreign Minister Fujiyama's statement to the U.S. side that 'revising the Security Treaty is the basis for making the Kishi cabinet a long-term stable regime' may not necessarily be considered correct from today's situation. This is a factor that is even sufficient to change the premise of the negotiations. Therefore, after holding two formal meetings, the (Japan-U.S.) negotiations completely stalled."

Kyodo News's commentary said that, for the U.S. side, the first unexpected thing was that, after Fujiyama returned to China in September this year after talks with Dulles in Washington, the Liberal Democratic Party immediately appeared with the argument that a cautious attitude should be adopted towards the issue of revising the "Security Treaty"; the second unexpected thing was the "chaos" caused by this revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

The commentary said, "Foreign Minister Fujiyama is seriously studying how to avoid a recurrence of a problem like the one caused by the revision of the 'Police Duties Execution Law.' Moreover, it currently seems that this possibility has also emerged: depending on the attitude taken by the Socialist Party and the movements of the various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party, it may be necessary to re-examine the direction proposed by Prime Minister Kishi and Foreign Minister Fujiyama in the past regarding the method and content of the revision of the (Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty") in the National Diet's deliberation schedule."

Kyodo News said that Fujiyama believes that "to solve this problem, it is necessary to first look at the content of the revision. Therefore, it is necessary to fully consider domestic public opinion before determining Japan's final attitude towards the issue of revising the Security Treaty." Kyodo News said that, as is concentratedly expressed in the issue of expanding the Japan-U.S. "common defense area" to Okinawa, this depends on how to eliminate this criticism: if the "Security Treaty" is revised, there is a risk of increasing the possibility of Japan being dragged into war.

Kyodo News then revealed that the Nobusuke Kishi government, which has run out of options, has begun to step up propaganda to deceive the Japanese people, in an attempt to prevent its conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty," which would drag the Japanese people into the U.S. war of aggression, from going bankrupt. But the future remains bleak. Kyodo News said, "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has keenly felt the need to re-promote the shortcomings of the current Security Treaty and the necessity of revising the Security Treaty, and has already begun to do so. However, this state of affairs has at least prevented the government from submitting this bill immediately after the resumption of the National Diet's ordinary session. If it is delayed until March next year, it is estimated that it will be difficult to submit this bill to the National Diet's ordinary session in practice."

The commentary concluded, "Prime Minister Kishi and Foreign Minister Fujiyama are currently facing very serious tests both domestically and internationally due to the issue of revising the Security Treaty."

### 修改日美“安全条约”阴谋在日本遭到激烈反对  共同社担心岸政府将受致命打击

    修改日美“安全条约”阴谋在日本遭到激烈反对
    共同社担心岸政府将受致命打击
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：从共同社13日发表的一篇评论可以看出，岸信介在日本人民反对它修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争的猛烈冲击下，正在害怕日本人民乘胜追击，粉碎它的修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋，从而动摇它的统治的基础。共同社说，“岸内阁已经因为修改警察官职务执行法的问题受到了很大的创伤，如果因修改安全条约问题而再次受到重伤的话，这对岸内阁来说，无疑将成一个致命打击。”
    岸信介政府正在和美国谈判把日美“安全条约”修改成“共同防御条约”，以便使日本充当美国在远东进行军事侵略的马前卒。而修改警察法是岸信介政府为镇压国内人民反对这一侵略计划预作安排，加强警察统治。共同社说，“继警察官职务执行法修正案问题之后，修改安全条约的问题必然会成为日本政治斗争的一个题目。在这种情况出现以后，在自由民主党内部，主张慎重行事的人又多起来了。美国方面也非常担心日本国内的气氛恶化。”
    评论说，“社会党委员长铃木茂三郎12日在社会党临时大会上发表演说时说‘修改安全条约就是为了准备核武器战争’，这句话大大震动了藤山外务相；这件事清楚地显示出，社会党准备继警察官职务执行法修正案问题之后，要集中力量去攻击政府修改安全条约。”共同社十分担心社会党将“趁反对政府修改安全条约的机会，进一步巩固因反对警察官职务执行法修正案而团结起来的形同国民战线的打倒岸内阁的阵容。”共同社说，“岸首相和藤山外务相完全没有预料到修改警察官职务执行法的问题会同修改安全条约的问题牵联到这种地步；而且，这种情况是在谈判已经进行了相当时日以后发生的，这件事使政府陷于更加尴尬的境地。”评论说，“美国方面也已经认识到，岸首相和藤山外务相向美国方面说过的‘修改安全条约是使岸内阁成为长期稳定政权的基础’这番话，从今天的情况看来，不一定可以认为是正确的了。这是一个甚至足以改变谈判的前提的因素。因此，在举行了两次正式会谈以后，（日美）谈判就完全陷于停顿状态。”
    共同社的评论说，对美国方面来说，第一件意外的事情是，藤山今年9月在华盛顿同杜勒斯会谈回国以后，自由民主党内部立刻出现了对修改“安全条约”问题要采取慎重态度的论调；第二件没有预料到的事情就是这次修改“警察官职务执行法”问题所引起的“混乱”。
    评论说，“藤山外相正在很认真地研究，怎样才能避免惹起一个像修改“警察官职务执行法所引起的问题之类的问题的重演。而且，目前好像也出现了这种可能性：看社会党采取的态度和自由民主党内部各派系的动向如何，也许要在国会审议日程（日美“安全条约”）修改的方式和修改的内容等方面，重新研究岸首相和藤山外务相过去所提出的方针。”
    共同社说，藤山认为，“要解决这个问题，无论如何首先要看修改的内容是什么。因此，有必要在充分考虑国内舆论以后，再来确定日本方面对修改安全条约问题的最后态度。”共同社说，正如集中地表现在日美“共同防御地区”扩大到冲绳的问题上的情况那样，这取决于怎样消除这种批评：如果修改“安全条约”，就有增加日本卷进战争去的可能性的危险。
    共同社接着透露，走投无路的岸信介政府已经开始加紧欺骗日本人民的宣传，企图使它把日本人民拖进美国侵略战争的修改“安全条约”的阴谋不致破产。但是前途依然暗淡。共同社说，“外务省已经痛切地感到有必要重新大力宣传现行安全条约的缺点和修改安全条约的必然性，并且已经开始这样做。不过，这种状态至少已经使政府不能在国会平时会议复会以后立刻提出这项法案。如果拖到明年3月的话，估计想要向国会平时会议提出这项法案，事实上也有困难。”
    评论最后说，“岸首相和藤山外务相目前正在为修改安全条约的问题而受到国内外非常严重的考验。”
