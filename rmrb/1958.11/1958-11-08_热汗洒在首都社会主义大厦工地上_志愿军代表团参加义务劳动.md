Xinhua News Agency, 7th — Today morning, the magnificent construction site in front of Tiananmen Square was seething. Headed by General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, holding high the labor red flag, joined the ranks of the great leap forward in the construction of the motherland and sprinkled their sweat on the construction site of the great socialist mansion in the capital.

    At nine o'clock in the morning, as this heroic team, bathed in the sunshine, walked across Tiananmen Square and entered the construction site with red flags fluttering, cheers like spring thunder resounded from the construction site: "Learn from the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" "Learn from the vigor of the Volunteer Army and build our great capital!"

    Amidst warm cheers and applause, General Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, delivered a speech. He said kindly: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation feels infinitely happy and delighted to come to the construction site and work with everyone. The vigor of the people of the capital and the people of the motherland has given us great encouragement. We must learn from you and build a beautiful capital together with you!

    Tense and pleasant labor began. General Yang Yong swung his arm, which had once commanded thousands of troops to victorious battles, and issued a loud and firm voice: "Let's do it, comrades! Work hard!" General Wang Ping said to the comrades of the construction site headquarters: "Let's have a competition with the working class elder brothers." Then, General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping took off their military jackets, rolled up their trouser legs, and started shoveling earth with iron shovels. General Wang Yunrui carried a heavy load of earth baskets and ran. General Ding Laifu, known as a "jack-of-all-trades," sometimes carried soil baskets and sometimes pushed a cart full of soil. He said: "My skills were learned more than 20 years ago in my hometown in Shandong. I didn't give them up in Korea, and now I'm using them again to build the motherland!" General Zhang Mingyuan, with graying temples, and General Yan Jinsheng, who was strong and sturdy, cooperated closely. One shoveled soil into baskets, and the other carried soil, working as hard as young men.

    In the surging ranks of labor, the battle heroes, each as brave as a tiger, were even more eye-catching, filled with endless power. Battle hero Lu Changrong carried soil baskets and ran like the wind, without stopping. He said excitedly: "After returning to the motherland, we first participated in the construction of the great capital. This is really too happy!" Battle hero Zhao Jihua and second-class meritorious service member Chen Xinglong are a pair of close comrades-in-arms from the heroic position of Maryang Hill. In the past, they fought side by side in the hail of bullets and defeated the American invading army. Today, under the brilliant red flag, they are carrying earth baskets together again, running on the construction site in front of Tiananmen Square. How hot and excited the heroes' hearts are. Zhao Jihua said: "Today, we are working in front of Tiananmen Square, by the side of Chairman Mao, how happy and glorious!" Chen Xinglong said: "We will use the energy we used to fight the enemy to build the motherland well!" They encouraged each other and worked hard together, not enjoying carrying small baskets, so they switched to large baskets. When the carrying pole broke, they changed another one, showing unparalleled heroic spirit.

    From the first day of their return to the motherland, the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have been eagerly asking to use their own hands to participate in the construction of the great motherland. Today, their wish has come true. Today, they are using their hands that pierced the American paper tiger in battle, their hands that consolidated and developed the friendship between China and North Korea in labor, to begin participating in the construction of the great motherland.

    热汗洒在首都社会主义大厦工地上
    志愿军代表团参加义务劳动
    据新华社7日讯　今天上午，宏伟的天安门前的建筑工地上沸腾了。以杨勇上将和王平上将为首的中国人民志愿军代表团高举着劳动红旗，投入了祖国人民建设大跃进的行列，把他们的汗水洒在伟大首都社会主义大厦的工地上。
    上午九时，当这支英雄队伍披着阳光，走过天安门广场，进入红旗飘舞的建筑工地时，工地上响起了一片春雷般的欢呼声：“向英雄的中国人民志愿军学习！”“学习志愿军的干劲，建设我们伟大的首都！”
    中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将在热烈的欢呼声和掌声中讲了话。他亲切地说：中国人民志愿军代表团来到工地和大家一起劳动，感到无限幸福和愉快。首都人民和祖国人民的干劲给了我们莫大的鼓舞。我们要向你们学习，并和你们一起建设美丽的首都！
    紧张、愉快的劳动开始了。杨勇将军挥起他那曾经指挥过千军万马胜利作战的手臂，发出了宏亮而坚定的声音：“干吧，同志们！加油地干！”王平将军向工地指挥部的同志们表示：“我们和工人老大哥来个竞赛吧。”接着，杨勇将军和王平将军带头脱下了军上衣，卷起裤管，拿起铁锹就铲土。王蕴瑞将军挑起了一副沉重的土筐子奔跑。被称为“多面手”的丁莱夫将军一会儿挑土担子，一会儿又推起一辆满载的手推车来了。他说：“我的本事还是二十多年前在山东的家乡学的，在朝鲜也没扔下，建设祖国又用上了！”鬓发斑白的张明远将军和身强力壮的颜金生将军密切合作，他们一个铲土装筐，一个挑担运土，干劲赛过小伙子。
    在奔腾如流的劳动行列里，一个个勇如猛虎的战斗英雄们更惹人注目，他们浑身是无穷的力量。战斗英雄陆昌荣担起土筐来快步如飞，一直不停歇。他兴奋地说：“回到祖国，我们就首先参加了伟大首都的建设，这真是太幸福了！”战斗英雄赵积华和二等功臣陈兴隆是来自马良山英雄阵地上的一对亲密战友。当年，他们在枪林弹雨中并肩战斗，打败了美国侵略军，今天，他们在灿烂的红旗下，又一起抬着土筐，奔跑在天安门前的建设工地上，英雄们的心多么火热和激动，赵积华说：“今天，咱们是在天安门前，在毛主席的身边劳动呀，多么幸福和光荣！”陈兴隆说：“我们拿出打敌人的劲头来，一定把祖国建设好！”他们互相鼓舞，一起猛干，抬着小筐不过瘾，换大筐，扁担压断了，再换一根，表现了无比的英雄气概。
    中国人民志愿军英雄们从回到祖国的第一天起，就迫切地要求用自己的双手，参加伟大祖国建设的心愿今天实现了。今天，他们用戳穿美国纸老虎的战斗的双手，巩固与发展中朝友谊的劳动的双手，开始参加了伟大祖国的建设。
