The Man Who Forgets Himself
By our reporter Hai Bo

After enthusiastic evaluation, the group finally selected the advanced producer for the third quarter. Everyone was excited and proud to have chosen their most ideal advanced figure, technician Ma Xueli. So even though the election was over, everyone continued to talk about it endlessly.

Ma Xueli's mood was a little different from everyone else's. As soon as the election was over, he nervously ran to Li Ronggen, the party branch secretary of the workshop, and the first thing he said was, "Secretary Li, I have a request to make to the Party."

Ma Xueli was a lathe operator, and Li Ronggen was also a lathe operator. Their ages were also similar. They knew each other very well. But what was this all about today? Li Ronggen couldn't guess at all. Li Ronggen knew that Ma Xueli was this kind of person: he worked vigorously, but only thought about ideas in silence. On weekdays, it was hard to know where he was working. He didn't say a word all day long, only knowing how to work. No matter how great the difficulties, he always overcame them himself. In recent years, everyone has always elected him as an advanced producer, not only of the factory but also of the city, and they have regarded him as a red flag.

Li Ronggen guessed for a long time and couldn't figure out why Ma Xueli had come today, so he said to him, "Old Ma, please sit down, let's talk about what you want."

Ma Xueli said, "I request that I not be selected as an advanced producer this time."

Li Ronggen smiled and said, "This wasn't my suggestion, it's the workers' opinion!"

Ma Xueli said, "Those creations are not entirely my own credit. The main credit goes to the leadership of the Party and the work of the workers. I just came up with some ideas, that's all, and that's what I should do." Li Ronggen looked closely at Ma Xueli's pleading expression. He was almost as stubborn as a child. Li Ronggen patted Ma Xueli on the shoulder and said, "Yes, we Communists should always be humble, never complacent, and always move forward. But we must also be realistic. You were chosen because it's the workers' opinion, and you should also obey everyone's opinion, right!" Ma Xueli was silent.

Ma Xueli has been a worker for more than ten years and has worked in three factories. In the factory, everyone can talk about some of his moving deeds, but no one can talk about all of his deeds. Since the Great Leap Forward, his stories have been one after another.

In the spring of this year, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory was still in the stage of construction and production. The situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country was surging, and the situation put forward a task that seemed difficult to accomplish at that time: starting with an annual output of more than forty machine tools, then leaping to one hundred and thirty, and then to two hundred. Two hundred heavy machine tools, what a huge number! In the past, the whole country couldn't produce so many in a year. However, the situation required that it could not escape this arduous and great responsibility. Because the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory is currently the largest, most advanced, and only heavy machine tool factory in China, and the eyes of the people of the whole country are watching it.

After the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, no one in the factory didn't recognize the serious significance of this arduous task. After the Party Committee issued a call to all employees to ensure the completion of the state's tasks and the realization of a great leap in production, it immediately received a warm response from the majority of employees. Ma Xueli, like everyone else, threw himself into this hard battle. But Ma Xueli thought even more than the average person. He thought that it wouldn't work to just rely on hard work to make a great leap forward. Therefore, the Party's call for technological revolution aroused his great interest.

Ma Xueli fired the first shot of the factory's technological revolution.

When doing anything, you have to find the weak link, and it's the same with producing machines. What was the weak link in the production of heavy machine tools? Ma Xueli paid close attention to everything in the workshop every day. Ma Xueli went to the workers to discuss and research. As a result, he immediately discovered that machining the "ram" was the most laborious and backward work in production, a weak link. The workers doing this work were hunched over, sweating profusely, but they couldn't even make one a day.

"Wouldn't it be great to make a set of trepanning tools?" Ma Xueli pondered day and night, and finally came up with this method, but he wasn't sure. He went to the party branch secretary to talk about his ideas.

The party branch secretary fully supported him.

With the encouragement of the party branch, Ma Xueli's energy came. However, the engineer in charge of this work didn't believe that he could solve the problem, because this engineer was also designing a deep drill for this problem. Therefore, when Ma Xueli went to the relevant departments to talk about trial-producing the trepanning tools, they didn't even pay attention to him, saying, "We're too busy! We don't have time to do it."

What a blow this was, and how impolite. But Ma Xueli didn't care about these. He posted a big-character poster saying, "Request materials, give me seamless steel pipes, I will make 'trepanning tools' myself, otherwise you will be fully responsible for wasting the state's time and materials."

Several days after the big-character poster was posted, the materials were still nowhere to be seen. What to do? Give up? No! No, Ma Xueli has never been this kind of person. He often said, "This is not for personal gain, it is for the country, for the Party, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome."

In a helpless situation, Ma Xueli and a few workers tried to do it themselves. He used waste materials to machine and mill himself. He worked for several nights in a row, and the trepanning tool was finally successfully manufactured. Its efficiency was two or three times higher than the original, and it could save a large amount of steel, and the workers were no longer tired of sweating profusely from doing this kind of work. In the same time, Ma Xueli also successfully trial-produced the "inner hole reamer." This tool also increased efficiency by more than one time, greatly reducing the physical labor of the workers.

What a great creation was the birth of these two tools! All the workers were thrilled by these creations. Big-character posters of praise were immediately posted everywhere. However, all the big-character posters praised "learning from Comrade Peng Maotang's spirit of technological innovation" and did not mention Ma Xueli.

What was going on? Strange, really strange. Why was the wrong person being praised? Did someone have an opinion about Ma Xueli and deliberately not mention him? Or was someone trying to take credit? Of course, this is the question everyone would ask. But Ma Xueli had no interest in thinking about these things at all. Ma Xueli was immediately attracted by another more important creation.

He called this new struggle the story of inventing the "external whirling milling cutter." The "external whirling milling cutter" is a tool used to process "worms." In the past, a helical milling cutter was used, and one person could not make one a day, and the workers had to work hunched over, making people's backs ache. After the Great Leap Forward, although the workers worked overtime and worked hard, they still couldn't meet the needs. This was a toy that had been used for generations, but now it was caught by Ma Xueli again. He came up with the idea of the "external whirling milling cutter." He and the workers chatted about it, and they all said it would work. But when he took his drawings to an engineer to look at, this engineer was even more annoying than the one who had already spoken. When they met in the morning, he looked at Ma Xueli's sketches, sneered, and said, "I'll study it and decide this afternoon." When Ma Xueli went in the afternoon, he also took out his own set, saying, "I also made one, just add a milling head." Ma Xueli was very happy to hear that the engineer had also made one, but when he took the drawings and looked at them, Ma Xueli was shocked. His own drawings were only a few pages, while the engineer's drawings were a thick stack, so complicated that they were frightening. Ma Xueli said, "This is too complicated, the cost is high, and it's difficult to operate." Because Ma Xueli argued with reason, the engineer vaguely agreed, "Okay, I'll help you do it." And he also promised to draw the detailed drawings in one day.

Ma Xueli was extremely happy, and went back to wait, wait, wait... Days passed in vain, but the engineer never brought the drawings. It wasn't until he went to question the engineer again that he learned that his "external whirling milling cutter" had been "executed" by the engineer.

How heartbroken Ma Xueli was! How much loss would his hard work and the state's property suffer!

In order to win as soon as possible, he continued to struggle with the engineer. He took his drawings to reason with him, and also went to the Party organization for help. This finally made the engineer agree to find someone to draw the drawings. Ma Xueli and several other workers received the drawings and did not rest. They worked hard for four days and nights in a row. After three failures, a new tool that had never existed before – the "external whirling milling cutter" – was born. It spun lightly and quickly. One worker could watch two machines, and as long as you turned on the power, it didn't matter if you sat with your hands in your sleeves. The work for the whole year could be finished in just one month. Its work efficiency was twelve times higher than the original.

The story ends here, but there are two more sentences that must be made clear. Ma Xueli invented the "trepanning tool" and "inner hole reamer," so why wasn't he praised, but someone else was? How was it finally brought to light? Dear comrades, please rest assured, everything in our society makes you happy. Ma Xueli is a person who doesn't like to talk, and Peng Maotang and others who were praised were because they were the first to use trepanning tools and other tools. The person who wrote the big-character poster didn't have an in-depth understanding of these situations, so they praised them. But Comrade Peng Maotang and others did not impersonate them. They quickly made a statement about the matter with the loyal and excellent qualities of the working class, explaining the truth of the matter.

    忘记自己的人
    本报记者　海波
    经过热烈的评比之后，小组终于选出了第三季度先进生产者，大家都为能够选出自己最理想的先进人物、技术员马学礼而感到兴奋和自豪。所以选举虽然完了，大家还是谈论不休。
    马学礼却和大家的情绪有点不同，选举刚过，他就神情紧张地跑到车间党支部书记李荣根那里去，第一句话就说：“李支书，我向党提个要求。”
    马学礼是车工出身，李荣根也是车工出身，年龄和马学礼也差不多。两人彼此了解很深。可是，今天是什么事情呢？李荣根一点也猜不透。李荣根知道，马学礼是这样的人：干活泼辣，但光闷着想点子。在平日，很难知道他在那儿工作。他一天到黑一声不吭，只知干活，再有天大的困难，他也总是自己克服。近几年来大家总是把他选为先进生产者，不仅是厂的、而且是市的，都把他当作一面红旗。
    李荣根猜了半天实在猜不到今天马学礼所为何来，就对他说：“老马，请坐，有什么要求谈吧！”
    马学礼说：“我要求这次不要再把我选为先进生产者了。”
    李荣根笑了笑说：“这也不是我提的，是工人的意见呀！”
    马学礼说：“那些创造不全是我自己的功劳，主要功劳是党的领导，是工人做的，我不过只出了些主意罢了，这都是应该的。”李荣根端详着马学礼那个恳求的样子，他简直有点像小孩一样的执拗了。李荣根拍拍马学礼的肩膀说：“是的，我们共产党员永远都应该谦虚，永远也不能自满，而要不断前进。但是，也要实事求是，选你，这是工人的意见，你也应该服从大家的意见，对吧！”马学礼默不作声。
          ×　×　×
    马学礼当了十多年的工人，曾经在三个工厂工作过。在厂子里谁都能谈出他一些动人的事迹来，但谁也谈不全他的事迹。自从大跃进以来，他的故事更是一个连着一个。
    今年春天，武汉重型机床厂还处在边建设边生产的时期，全国大跃进的形势奔来了，形势向这个工厂提出了当时看来是很难办到的任务：开始是年产四十多台机床，接着跃进到一百三十台，而后又要二百台。二百台重型机床，这是一个多么大的数字啊！过去一年全国也产不了这么多。但是，形势要求它不能逃避这个艰巨而伟大的责任。因为武汉重型机床厂是目前我国规模最大、设备最新的唯一的重型机床厂，全国人民的眼睛都望着它。
    经过整风和反右派斗争，厂里的全体工人没有一个不认识这个艰巨任务的严重意义。党委向全体职工发出了保证完成国家任务实现生产大跃进的号召后，马上得到了广大职工的热烈响应。马学礼和大家一样，投入了这场苦战。但是马学礼比一般人想的更多一些，他想，要大跃进光靠硬拼是不行的。因此，党提出的进行技术革命的号召引起了他的极大兴趣。
    马学礼打响了厂里技术革命的第一炮。
    干什么事情都要找薄弱环节，生产机器也是一样。重型机床厂生产中的薄弱环节是什么呢？马学礼天天留心地观察着车间的一切。马学礼去找工人商量研究。结果一下子发现车“滑枕”是生产中最费力又是生产最落后的活儿，是个薄弱环节。干这活的工人，弓腰弯背，满头大汗，但一天还作不了一个。
    “作一个套料刀不很好吗？”马学礼日夜琢磨，最后想出了这样一个办法，但他拿不准，他去找党支部书记谈了自己的想法。
    党支部书记十分支持他。
    在党支部的鼓励下，马学礼劲来了。可是主管这项工作的工程师不相信他能解决问题，因为这位工程师也正在为这个问题设计一种深钻。因此，当马学礼到有关部门谈试制套料刀时，他们连理也不理说：“工作太忙啦！没有时间做。”
    这是一个多么大的打击，又是多么没有礼貌。可是马学礼不理会这些，他贴了一张大字报说：“要求材料，给我无缝钢管，我自己制造‘套料刀’，否则浪费了国家的时间和材料全由你们负责。”
    大字报贴出后好几天，材料仍无踪影。怎么办呢？算了吗？不！不能，马学礼从来不是这样的人。他常说，“这不是为了个人，是为了国家，为了党，没有不能克服的困难。”
    在无可奈何的情况下，马学礼和几个工人想办法自己做，他用废材料自己车，自己铣，一连搞了几个通宵，套料刀终于制造成功了。它的工效比原来的提高了两三倍，并且能节约大批钢材，而工人再也不因干这种活累得满头大汗了。在同一时间内，马学礼还试制成功了“内孔稍胎”。这种工具也提高工效一倍多，大大减轻了工人的体力劳动。
    这两种工具的诞生是多么伟大的创举啊！全体工人都为这些创造而欢欣鼓舞。表扬的大字报马上纷纷贴出来了。但是，所有的大字报都表扬的是“学习彭茂堂同志的技术革新精神”，而没有提到马学礼。
              ×　×　×
    是怎么回事呢？奇怪，真是奇怪。为什么会表扬错了呢？是别人对马学礼有意见故意不提他吗？还是有人想争功，这当然是每个人都会提出的问题。但是马学礼根本没有兴趣去想这些，马学礼马上又被另一个更重大的创造吸引住了。
    他把这场新斗争叫作发明“外旋风铣”的故事。“外旋风铣”是用来加工“蜗杆”的一种刀具。过去用的是螺旋铣刀，一天一人干不了一个，而且工人必须弓着腰干，累得人们腰酸腿痛。大跃进后，工人们虽然加班苦干，可是仍然远远不能满足需要。这是用了几辈子的玩艺儿，但现在它又被马学礼抓住了。他想出了“外旋风铣”这个巧板眼。他和工人们一唧咕，都说行。但是当他把自己的图纸拿去找一个有关的工程师看时，这位工程师比已经说过的那位还气人些。上午一见面，他看了看马学礼的草图，冷笑了一声，说：“研究一下，下午决定。”下午马学礼去时，他也拿出了自己的一套，说：“我也作了一个，只加个铣头就可以了。”马学礼听说工程师也作了一个，十分高兴，但把图纸拿来一看，把马学礼吓了一跳，他自己的图纸只几页，而工程师的图纸是厚厚的一叠子，复杂得叫人害怕。马学礼说：“这太复杂了，成本高，难操作。”由于马学礼据理力争，这位工程师含糊地答应说：“好，帮你做。”而且还答应一天即把详图画出来。
    马学礼高兴极了，回去等呀、等呀，一天两天……几天白白过去了，可是到底不见这位工程师拿图纸来。直到他再次去追问这位工程师时，才知道他的“外旋风铣”被这位工程师“枪毙”了。
            ×　×　×
    马学礼是多么痛心啊！他的心血、国家的财产要受多少损失啊！
    为了早日胜利，他向这位工程师继续进行了斗争。他把自己的图纸拿去向他讲理，并且去找党组织帮了忙，这样终于使这位工程师答应找人把图纸画出来了。马学礼和另外几个工人接到图纸没有休息，就连续苦战了四个昼夜，经过三次失败，一架从来没有过的新工具——“外旋风铣”诞生了。它轻巧地飞转着，工人们一人可以看两台机器，而且只要通上电，即是抄手坐着也没关系。今年全年的活只要一个月就可以干完了。它的工作效率比原来提高了十二倍。
            ×　×　×
    故事说到这里就完了，但还有两句话必须说清楚，马学礼发明了“套料刀”、“内孔稍胎”，为什么不表扬他而表扬了别人，最后是怎样搞得水落石出的？亲爱的同志们，请放心吧，在我们的社会里，一切都令你愉快。马学礼是个不肯说话的，而被表扬的彭茂堂等几个人，是因为他们最先使用了套料刀等工具，写大字报的人没有深入了解这些情况就表扬了，但是彭茂堂等同志没有冒名顶替，他们很快就以工人阶级那种忠诚的优秀品质对事情作了声明，说明了问题的真相。
