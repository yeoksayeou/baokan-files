Xinhua News Agency, London, November 25th: A protest rally and demonstration were held in London tonight to oppose the visit of U.S. Vice President Nixon to Britain.

The demonstration was organized by the London District Committee of the British Communist Party. As the demonstrators passed through the main streets of central London, they shouted, "Nixon get out, and take your American troops with you!" Police were stationed along the streets where the demonstrators passed.

The huge banner at the front of the procession read: "American warmongers get out of Britain!" Other slogans read: "Nixon is war," "Withdraw American bases," "No American rockets here," "Stop American control of Britain."

Nixon arrived in Britain this morning for a four-day state visit.

At the airport in Washington, someone pointed out to him that there seemed to be people in Britain preparing a so-called "welcome" for his visit. Nixon jokingly said that he was quite experienced in such "welcomes." Nevertheless, in view of his beating experience in Latin American countries this spring, Nixon had to say that he did not intend to meet with the masses on the streets as he had done in other countries before. As Nixon dined with British Prime Minister Macmillan at 10 Downing Street tonight, the demonstrators sent a delegation to the American Embassy to deliver their statement of protest. The statement said that Nixon and the American government were pursuing the same goals as Hitler's fascism, namely, to dominate the world. The statement condemned the American government's policy of piecing together military blocs and establishing military bases, and condemned the United States for obstructing the easing of tensions and the reduction of the danger of war, and for opposing the prohibition of nuclear weapons and opposing the ending of the arms race. The statement particularly pointed out, "American troops, bombers and rockets are stationed on our country's soil under the command of American generals. American spokesmen contemptuously regard our country as a 'pawn'."

George Matthews, a member of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, said in a mass rally: "We are telling Nixon to go home because we want our country to be free, strong and prosperous, and also because his policies will lead us to ruin." He pointed out that for Nixon, Britain is merely a U.S. missile launching pad.

Matthews said: "It is time for American troops to withdraw from Quemoy, Taiwan, Berlin, and Britain. Let Nixon take his policy of banning trade between East and West, take the American bombers and nuclear missiles, take all those vicious American generals who are ravaging the land of Europe, and get out!"

Matthews said to thunderous applause: American imperialism has no future, despite their nuclear weapons and missiles, etc. He said: "Standing on the side of victory are we, together with the people of the Soviet Union and China, not Nixon." (Attached picture)

    英国人民怒逐灾星
    要尼克松滚回去
    新华社伦敦25日电　伦敦今晚举行了抗议集会和游行示威，反对美国副总统尼克松访问英国。
    这次示威是英国共产党伦敦区委员会组织的。示威者在经过伦敦中心的大街时高呼：“尼克松滚回去，把你们美国佬的军队也一起带回去！”示威者经过的街道两旁布满了警察。
    游行队伍最前面高举着的巨幅横额上写着：“美国战争贩子滚出英国去！”其他的标语上写着：“尼克松就是战争”，“撤销美国基地”，“这里不要美国火箭”，“停止美国对英国的控制”。
    尼克松是在今天早晨到英国来作为时四天的国事访问的。
    在华盛顿的机场上曾有人向他指出，看来在英国正有人准备对他的访问举行一场所谓的“欢迎”，当时尼克松自我解嘲地说，他对这类“欢迎”已经颇有经验了。尽管如此，鉴于今年春天在访问拉丁美洲国家时的挨打经验，尼克松又不得不说，他不打算像以前在其他国家那样在街道上同群众见面。当尼克松今晚同英国首相麦克米伦在唐宁街十号首相官邸一起进晚餐时，示威者派了一个代表团向美国大使馆递交了他们的抗议声明。这份声明说，尼克松和美国政府正在追求同希特勒法西斯主义相同的目的，这就是统治全世界。声明谴责美国政府拼凑军事集团和建立军事基地的政策，并且谴责美国阻挠缓和紧张局势和减少战争危险，反对禁止核武器、反对结束军备竞赛。声明特别指出，“美国军队、轰炸机和火箭在美国将军们的统率下驻扎在我国的国土上。美国的发言人轻蔑地把我国视为‘小卒’。”
    英国共产党执行委员会委员乔治·马修斯在群众集会上的讲话中说：“我们叫尼克松滚回家去是因为我们希望我们的国家自由、强大和繁荣，也是因为他的政策将使我们遭到毁灭。”他指出，对于尼克松来说，英国只不过是美国的一个导弹发射台而已。
    马修斯说：“现在是美国军队撤出金门、台湾、柏林和英国的时候了。让尼克松带着他的禁止东西方贸易的政策，带着美国的轰炸机和核导弹，带着所有那些蹂躏着欧洲的土地的穷凶极恶的美国将军们滚回家去吧！”
    马修斯在雷动的掌声中说：美国帝国主义是没有前途的，尽管他们有核武器和导弹等等。他说：“站在胜利的一边的是我们同苏联和中国的人民，而不是尼克松。”（附图片）
