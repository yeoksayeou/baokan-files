　　Iron and Steel Production Enters a Stage of Consolidation and Improvement
　　From "Small Native Groups" to "Small Foreign Groups"
　　Southern Shanxi Starts to Establish Iron and Steel Bases, Implementing Five Fixed Points to Move Towards Regularization
　　Xinhua Builds 13 Iron and Steel Coal Joint Enterprises, and Output Rises Sharply.
　　(Our newspaper Taiyuan, 7th dispatch) Shanxi Province's southern region, based on the vigorous development of iron and steel production by implementing the "small native groups" policy, has begun a planned movement to build iron and steel bases. It aims to gradually develop temporary mining and iron smelting sites into iron and steel plants, to gradually develop single iron smelting and steelmaking production into comprehensive industries, and to gradually move from "small native groups" towards mechanization and modernization.
　　The southern Shanxi region is rich in mineral resources. Iron reserves amount to 2,389 million tons (calculated as pure iron), copper reserves amount to 2.54 million tons, aluminum reserves amount to 540 million tons (calculated as pure aluminum), and coal reserves reach 13,140 million tons. Moreover, the mineral sources are concentrated, which is convenient for large-scale mining and smelting. This year, with the nationwide mass steelmaking campaign, the "small native groups" method has been adopted, and a large number of iron smelting furnaces have been built throughout the region, and many iron smelting sites have been opened up, turning southern Shanxi, which was originally a region that did not produce iron and steel, into a region that once produced 10,000 tons of pig iron per day, and the prospects for iron and steel production are extremely good.
　　After analyzing the above conditions, the CPC Jinan Prefectural Committee formulated a preliminary plan to gradually build Jinan into an iron and steel base, and put forward new goals for the people of the whole region: this year's iron and steel production plan must be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled, and next year, each of the 4 million people in the region must have an average of one ton of iron and half a ton of steel. The plan determines that Xiangning, Xipu, Huofen, Yicheng, and Anze are the five major iron mining areas; Hongzhao, Linfen, Fushan, Xiangfen, Yuanqu, and Pinglu are the six small iron mining areas; Yuanqu is the large copper mining area; and Jieyu and Wenxi are the two small copper mining areas.
　　The CPC Jinan Prefectural Committee requires that all localities carry out construction according to communist requirements from the very beginning. These are: First, it is necessary to break the limitations of county and commune boundaries, implement national collaboration, and build iron and steel bases. Second, the newly built iron and steel bases should become iron and steel people's communes. Third, it is necessary to let politics go to the mountains, culture go to the mountains, and science and technology go to the mountains through the construction of mining areas, and gradually eliminate the differences between mountainous and plain areas. To this end, the Prefectural Committee decided to first launch a large-scale debate in the entire region, especially among the iron and steel army, to establish the idea of ​​hard struggle and long-term construction, thoroughly criticize the idea of ​​localism, and establish the communist idea of ​​"I am for everyone, and everyone is for me"; second, each mining area and each county must conduct five fixings through debate, that is, fixing mining areas, fixing factories, fixing tasks, fixing institutions, and fixing personnel, so that production will gradually become regularized.
　　The construction of factories and furnaces should be carried out according to the principles of from small to large, from simple to complex, first native then foreign, and combining native and foreign methods. Currently, we must first focus on improving the existing native furnaces to improve the quality of iron smelting in native furnaces; quickly break through the production, management, and technical barriers of native blast furnaces, establish native blast furnace groups, and then establish small blast furnaces, so that they gradually form factories; with the development of production, continuously add and improve mining and smelting equipment, and gradually improve manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization; each mining area should establish its own coal supply plant, tool repair plant, refractory material plant, etc., with smelting as the center, in order to gradually develop into a comprehensive enterprise centered on iron and steel.
　　Now, a huge-scale mining area construction work has been launched in various mining areas and sites. The enthusiasm of the masses is soaring, and they have put forward the slogan of "transforming sites into construction sites, construction sites into bases, and mountainous areas into cities". Hongzhao County has completed the "five fixings" work of fixing mining areas, fixing factories, fixing tasks, fixing institutions, and fixing personnel, and has begun construction. The county's ten iron smelting plants have installed 166 various machines, built many houses and cave dwellings, and plan to open a highway from the county seat to the mining areas in November; telephones have been installed in the mining areas and between factories, and many factories will also install generators. The basic construction of other mining areas is also being carried out in conjunction with winter preparations.
　　(Our newspaper Changsha, 7th dispatch) Iron and steel production in Xinhua County, Hunan Province, has made new progress. The county has established 13 small-scale, combined native and foreign steel, iron, and coal joint enterprises on the basis of small native groups.
　　The native blast furnaces in Xinhua were originally widely distributed, which caused many difficulties in transportation and labor deployment. After studying this situation, the county party committee decided to divide the thirteen collaboration zones according to the distribution of coal and iron resources, promote the factory management of iron plants, improve labor organization, and establish a simple management system, so that coal and iron transportation could cooperate with each other under a unified command system.
　　During the period when the masses were running the communes in a big way, the county built 24 people's communes, of which 13 people's communes were established on the basis of collaborative regions. Since then, under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, the joint enterprises of steel, iron, and coal production have established specialized organizations such as iron smelting plants, coal mines, and transportation teams, forming a system that has powerfully promoted iron and steel production. Then, these thirteen coal and iron joint enterprises adopted the method of combining native and foreign methods to vigorously carry out the technical reform movement, selected excellent furnace types as examples, and transformed all the furnace types in the county. Now, the vast majority of the county's more than 3,000 native blast furnaces are water-releasing furnaces with high output and fuel saving. The furnaces in the county are also basically equipped with blowers to replace the manually pulled bellows, saving a large amount of labor. In October, the county's daily output of pig iron has been maintained at a level of 1,000 to 1,500 tons.
　　In order to further improve and develop iron and steel joint enterprises, the county scientific research institute has trained more than 400 steel, iron, and coal inspection personnel, so that each joint enterprise can initially build an inspection and analysis institution. The county farm tool factory is actively preparing to produce simple lathes for the people's communes to establish small-scale mechanical industries, so that each iron and steel joint enterprise can obtain the necessary equipment. The county has also trained more than 400 steelmaking technical talents, preparing to produce 5,000 tons of native steel before the end of the year to meet the needs of the county's mechanical industry.

    钢铁生产进入巩固提高阶段
    从“小土群”走向“小洋群”
    晋南着手建立钢铁基地实行五定走向正规化
    新化建成13个钢铁煤联合企业产量直线上升
    本报太原7日电　山西省晋南地区在贯彻“小土群”方针大闹钢铁生产的基础上，开始了有计划的钢铁基地的建设运动，要把临时性的采矿、炼铁现场逐步发展成为钢铁厂，要把单一的炼铁炼钢生产逐步发展成为综合性的工业，要由  “小土群”逐步走向机械化、现代化。
    晋南全区的矿藏资源丰富。铁的蕴藏量有二十三亿八千九百万吨（按纯铁计算），铜的蕴藏量有二百五十四万吨，铝的蕴藏量有五亿四千多万吨（按纯铝计算），煤的蕴藏量达一百三十一亿四千多万吨。而且矿源集中，便于大规模开采和冶炼。今年全民大炼钢铁，采取“小土群”的方法，全区已经建设起大量的炼铁炉，开辟了许多炼铁现场，使晋南由一个原来不生产钢铁的地区一度日产万吨生铁，钢铁生产的远景极为良好。
    中共晋南地委分析了上述条件后，拟定了把晋南逐步建成钢铁基地的初步规划，并且向全区人民提出了新的奋斗目标：今年的钢铁生产计划必须提前和超额完成，明年全区四百万人每人要平均有一吨铁、半吨钢。规划确定：乡宁、隰蒲、霍汾、翼城、安泽为五大铁矿区；洪赵、临汾、浮山、襄汾、垣曲、平陆，为六小铁矿区；垣曲为大铜矿区；解虞、闻喜两地为小铜矿区。
    中共晋南地委要求各地一开始就按照共产主义的要求进行建设。这就是：第一，要打破县界和社界的限制，实行全民协作，建设钢铁基地。第二，新建的钢铁基地要成为钢铁人民公社。第三，要通过矿区建设，让政治上山、文化上山、科学技术上山，逐步消灭山区和平原的差别。为此，地委确定，首先要在全区，特别是钢铁大军中展开一次大辩论，树立艰苦奋斗、长期建设的思想，彻底批判本位主义思想，树立我为人人、人人为我的共产主义思想；其次，各矿区、各县要通过辩论进行五定，即定矿区、定厂、定任务、定机构和定人员，以便生产逐步走上正规化。
    建厂、建炉要采取由小到大、由简到繁、先土后洋、土洋并举的方针进行。当前首先抓紧改进现有的土方炉，提高土方炉炼铁质量；迅速突破土高炉的生产、管理和技术关，建立起土高炉群，进而建立小高炉，使其逐步形成工厂；随着生产的发展，不断增添和改进采矿、冶炼设备，逐步地把手工操作提高到半机械化和机械化；各矿区以冶炼为中心，建立起自己的煤炭供应厂、工具修配厂、耐火材料厂等等，以便逐步发展成以钢铁为中心的综合企业。
    现在，一个规模巨大的矿区建设工作已经在各矿区、各现场展开。群众干劲冲天，提出了要把“现场变工地、工地变基地、山区变城市”的口号。洪赵县已经完成了定矿区、定厂、定任务、定机构、定人员的“五定”工作，并且已开始建设。这个县的十个炼铁厂已经安装了各种机械一百六十六部，建起了许多房屋和窑洞，并且计划在11月份内修通由县城到各矿区的公路；在矿区、各厂之间安装起电话，许多厂还要安装发电机。其他矿区的基本建设，也正在结合过冬准备进行。
    本报长沙7日电　湖南省新化县钢铁生产有了新发展。全县在小土群的基础上，建立了十三个小型的土洋结合的钢、铁、煤联合企业。
    新化的土高炉原来分布很广，在运输和劳力调配上发生了很多困难。县委研究这个情况，就决定按照煤铁资源的分布，划分了十三个协作区，推行铁厂管理工厂化，改善劳动组织，建立简便的管理制度，使煤、铁运输在一个指挥系统之下互相协作。
    在群众大办公社时，全县建成了二十四个人民公社，其中有十三个人民公社是在协作区的基础上建立的。从此，钢、铁、煤生产的联合企业就在公社党委统一领导下，建立了炼铁厂、采煤场、运输队等专业组织，形成一个体系，有力地推动了钢铁生产。接着，这十三个煤铁联合企业，又采用土洋结合的办法，大力开展技术改革运动，选定优秀炉型为榜样，把全县炉型全部改造过来。现在全县三千多座土高炉，绝大部分都是产量高、燃料省的放水炉。全县的炉子也基本都装上了鼓风机，代替人力拉的风箱，节省了大批劳动力。10月份全县生铁日产量，一直保持在一千到一千五百吨的水平。
    为使钢铁联合企业得到进一步的提高和发展，县科学研究所训练了四百多名钢、铁、煤的化验人员，使每个联合企业都能初步建成化验分析的机构。县农具厂正在积极准备生产简易车床，为人民公社建立小型机械工业，使每个钢铁联合企业得到必要的设备。全县还培训了四百多名炼钢技术人材，准备年底以前生产土钢五千吨，满足本县机械工业的需要。
