Throughout the country this year, there has been an unprecedented leap in the production of various types of livestock. According to incomplete statistics from the end of October, the number of pregnant large livestock nationwide reached 18,467,000, accounting for 67% of the total number of adult female livestock. The provinces and regions with full pregnancy rates include Hunan, Hebei, Anhui, Shaanxi, Hubei, Henan, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Shanxi, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Jiangxi provinces are approaching full pregnancy rates. There are 623 counties and cities with full pregnancy rates, accounting for more than 30% of the total number of counties and cities nationwide. The country has already produced 8,967,000 young livestock, equivalent to 10.74% of the total number of large livestock nationwide at the end of 1957. The survival rate of young livestock is generally very high. For example, Shaanxi Province has a young livestock survival rate of 93% this year; according to a typical survey in Gansu Province, the survival rate is also above 90%. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the number of large livestock nationwide can reach 90,063,000, an increase of 8.1% compared to the end of 1957, equivalent to twice the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan period. It is estimated that the number of sheep and goats can reach over 129 million by the end of the year, an increase of 28.7% compared to the end of 1957. According to incomplete statistics by the end of October, the country had a total of 218,630,000 pigs, an increase of 50% compared to the end of 1957. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the number can reach 250 million, equivalent to 1.8 times the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan period.

In order to meet the urgent needs of agricultural production power and livestock products after the people's communes were established, all localities actively improved the production performance of livestock. While carrying out a large number of breeding, they also firmly grasped the improvement work of sheep, horses, and cattle. According to incomplete statistics from the main sheep, horse, and cattle producing provinces and regions in mid-November, the number of crossbred sheep bred has been 1.2 times the total number of crossbred female sheep since liberation. The number of crossbred mares bred is more than twice the total number of crossbred mares since liberation. In addition, the use of dairy bulls to improve yellow cattle has begun on a large scale. According to a survey in Anhui Province, the first generation of hybrid cows produced 3,069 jin of milk in the first lactation period, with a maximum daily milking volume of 24.5 jin. In order to increase the supply of dairy products, many areas have begun to use draft cattle for milking. According to the experience of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, in addition to plowing and breeding calves, water buffalo can generally produce 10 jin of milk per day, with a maximum of 20 jin; yellow cattle can produce 5 jin of milk, with a maximum of more than 15 jin.

Putting politics in command, with the whole Party and the whole people taking action, is the fundamental reason for this year's double leap in livestock breeding and improvement. The central, provincial, and many county agricultural, commercial, and other relevant departments convened a series of on-site meetings on horse, cattle, and sheep breeding and improvement, silage feed, animal disease prevention, and the use of draft cattle for milking. Many regions put forward the "six full" combat slogan of "full mating, full accuracy, full birth, full survival, full strength, and full improvement" for adult female livestock, and the specific requirements of "people have surplus grain, livestock have surplus grass, and one year's storage for many years of use," which guaranteed the leap forward development of livestock.

Vigorously developing artificial insemination and making full use of excellent stud animals are the keys to carrying out improvement work quickly, well, and economically. According to statistics from 21 provinces (regions) and cities including Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia, more than 15,000 artificial insemination stations for horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs have been established, and more than 40,000 artificial insemination workers have been trained.

Currently, all localities are launching a winter mating campaign, not allowing female livestock to go through the winter without being pregnant; and are actively carrying out the wintering and spring work for various livestock, laying a solid foundation for a greater surge in livestock production next year.

    全国牲畜繁殖改良双丰收
    本报讯　今年全国各地各种牲畜生产出现了史无前例的飞跃发展。据10月底的不完全统计，全国大牲畜满怀母畜已达一千八百四十六点七万头，占成年母畜总数的67％。满怀省区有湖南、河北、安徽、陕西、湖北、河南、内蒙古自治区等七个省区；山西、青海、云南、江西四省已接近满怀。满怀县、市已经达到六百二十三个，占全国县、市总数的30％以上。全国已生产仔畜八百九十六点七万头，相当于1957年底全国大家畜总数的10.74％。仔畜成活率普遍很高。如陕西省今年仔畜成活率达93％；甘肃省根据典型调查，成活率也在90％以上。预计年底全国大家畜可以发展到九千零六十三万头，较1957年底增加8.1％，相当于第一个五年计划期间增加总数的一倍。绵、山羊预计到年底可以发展到一万二千九百多万头，较1957年底增加28.7％。到10月底的不完全统计，全国共有生猪二万一千八百六十三万头，较1957年底增加50％，预计到年底可以发展到二万五千万头，相当于第一个五年计划期间增加总数的一点八倍。
    各地为了满足人民公社化以后农业生产的动力和畜产品的迫切需要，积极提高牲畜生产性能，在大量配种繁殖的同时，也紧紧抓住了羊、马、牛的改良工作。据11月中旬全国主要产羊、马、牛的省、区不完全统计，已配种杂交绵羊，相当于解放以来杂交母羊总和的一点二倍；配种杂交母马相当于解放以来杂交母马总数的一倍以上；并开始用奶公牛大量改良黄牛。安徽省调查第一代杂交母牛第一个泌乳期产奶三千零六十九斤，最高日挤奶量二十四点五斤。为了增加奶食品的供应量，不少地区开始利用耕牛挤奶。据浙江、江苏、安徽、辽宁、黑龙江的经验，一头牛除了耕田、繁殖小牛外，水牛一般每日可以挤奶十斤，最高可达二十斤；黄牛可以挤奶五斤，最高可达十五斤以上。
    政治挂帅，全党全民动手，是今年牲畜繁殖改良双跃进的根本原因。中央、省和很多县的农业、商业等有关部门召开了一系列的马、牛、羊繁殖改良和青贮饲料、兽疫防治、利用耕牛挤奶等现场会议，很多地区提出了成年母畜全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮、全改良的“六全”战斗口号和“人有余粮，畜有余草，一年贮多年用”的具体要求，保证了牲畜的跃进发展。
    大搞人工授精，充分利用优良种公畜是多快好省地进行改良工作的关键。据河北、山西、内蒙古等二十一省（区）市的统计，共建立了马、牛、羊、猪人工授精站一万五千多处，训练人工授精员四万余人。
    当前，各地正在突击冬配，不让母畜空怀过冬；并积极做好各种牲畜的越冬度春工作，为明年畜牧生产的更大高涨打好巩固的基础。
