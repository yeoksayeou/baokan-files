    Chongqing Transforms into a City of Poetry

    (Reported by our newspaper) The mass cultural popularization movement has turned Chongqing into a city with unprecedented cultural activity. Singing is everywhere, everyone is creating, performances are happening everywhere, and everyone is participating in physical exercise. This is the new atmosphere that can be seen everywhere in Chongqing.
    Many factory and mine workers and street residents use poetry to write big-character posters, celebratory reports, letters of determination, revisions to production plans, and summaries. In the past month and a half, cadres, workers, and residents throughout the city have created more than 4.8 million pieces of work, including poems, dramas, cartoons, and clapper talks, averaging more than two works per person. Since August, the city has launched a mass upsurge of self-composition, self-singing, self-directing, and self-performing, with the slogans: "Everyone engages in creation, everyone is an actor," and "In the past, no one thought of poetry, now poetry is carried in baskets." The abundant literary and artistic creations of the masses in many factories, mines, and streets have been described as "an ocean of poetry." The Chongqing Livestock Products Processing Factory, where creative activities are particularly active, averages nine works per worker. The Wangjiang Machine Factory launched a "red-all-over" movement of literary and artistic creation, "Everyone is an author, everyone is on stage," with poetry "gardens" and "literary wall newspapers" posted everywhere inside and outside the factory. The factory's Party Secretary took the lead in composing a dance based on the moving scene of workers fighting day and night for steel and performed it in the workshop for the workers. One stage was not enough for the whole factory, so twelve new stages were opened, and a literary and artistic army of three thousand workers took turns performing their own creations. Now, in Chongqing, more than 2,700 clubs are spread throughout the city, with an average of one club for less than eight hundred people. In rural areas, every township and commune has a privately run cultural station, mass club, and library. In addition to professional troupes regularly spending more than two-thirds of their time going to the mountains and countryside for touring performances, there are more than 1,200 mass amateur troupes throughout the city. On the streets or in various clubs, there are often creative exhibitions organized by the masses themselves.
    Every evening, when people rest, those who love to sing habitually gather at the mass song-teaching stations on the streets. Residents of many streets, such as Zhongjiang Temple and Jinma Temple, from two- or three-year-old girls to fifty- or sixty-year-old elders, participate in singing. Now, one million people in Chongqing have learned eight new songs, including "Socialism is Good."
    The number of people participating in "ten-minute physical activities" in Chongqing has reached 80% of the total population. Every day when the time for exercise arrives, people go to the open spaces in front of and behind their houses to do calisthenics. Elderly people who do not like to do calisthenics learn Tai Chi. The masses also organize "hill-climbing teams" to carry out physical exercise.
    Many factories, mines, enterprises, and streets have launched multi-item or single-item cultural activity competitions. The workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company not only launched "challenge matches" in production but also set off a "challenge match in writing." Hundreds of amateur literary and artistic activists gathered to set up arenas, taking turns on stage to recite their own creations, turning a challenge match into a mass poetry recitation meeting.

    重庆变为诗歌之城
    本报讯　文化大普及运动使重庆变成一个文化空前活跃的城市。遍地有歌声，大家都创作，处处有演出，人人参加体育锻炼，这是重庆随处都可以见到的新气象。
    许多厂矿职工和街道居民写大字报、喜报、决心书、修订生产计划、做总结都用诗歌。全市干部、职工、居民在最近一个半月内，创作了诗歌、戏剧、漫画、快板等作品四百八十多万件，平均每人有作品两篇多。从8月份以来，全市掀起了一个群众性的自编、自唱、自导、自演的热潮，他们提出的口号是：“人人搞创作，个个是演员”、“从前无人把诗想，现在诗歌用篓装”。许多厂矿、街道群众文艺创作之多，被形容为“诗歌的海洋”。创作活动特别活跃的重庆畜产品加工厂，平均每个职工有九篇作品。望江机器厂开展了“人人是作者，个个上舞台”的文艺创作“满堂红”的运动，厂内厂外到处贴满了工人办的诗歌“园地”、“文艺墙报”。厂里的党委书记带头把工人日以继夜地为钢而战的动人情景编成舞蹈，到车间向工人演出。全厂一个舞台不够用，新辟了十二个舞台，有三千职工文艺大军轮流演出他们自己创作的节目。现在，在重庆市，二千七百多个俱乐部遍布全市，平均不到八百人就有一个俱乐部。农村里乡乡、社社都有民办文化站、群众俱乐部和图书馆。全市除专业剧团经常坚持三分之二以上的时间上山下乡作巡回演出之外，群众业余剧团达到一千二百多个。在街头或各个俱乐部里，常常有群众自己举办的创作展览。
    每当黄昏，人们休息的时候，爱唱歌的人都习惯地聚集在街头的群众教歌站。钟江寺、金马寺等许多街道的居民，从二、三岁的小姑娘到五、六十岁的老人都参加唱歌。现在重庆市已经有一百万人学会了“社会主义好”等八首新歌。
    参加“十分钟体育活动”的人在重庆市已经达到总人口的80％。每天锻炼的时间一到，人们就走到屋前屋后的旷坝上做起广播操来。老年人不爱做操就学打太极拳。群众还组织“爬坡队”来进行体育锻炼。
    许多厂矿、企业和街道展开了多项或单项文化活动的比赛。重庆钢铁公司的职工不仅在生产上展开“擂台比武”，还掀起“擂台比文”，几百个业余文艺积极分子，群聚摆擂，轮番上台朗诵自己的创作，把一个摆擂大会变成了群众性的诗歌朗诵大会。
