Large-Scale Winter Construction on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway
Tens of Thousands of Workers Fight on Railway Construction Sites
Urumqi, 8th – The large-scale winter construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has begun, with tens of thousands of workers battling on railway construction sites along nearly one thousand kilometers of the line.

The scale of this winter’s construction on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is very large. In addition to continuing track laying on the 180-kilometer section of roadbed from Hongliu River to Hami that has already been completed, construction will continue or gradually begin on the thousands of kilometers of track from Hami to the border. This includes the famous inland depression of the Turpan Basin, which is below sea level, the densely tunnelled Daban City Tunnel group in the Tianshan Mountains, and the Gobi and swampy areas. The project is very arduous, and the natural conditions are relatively poor. Some areas of the Gobi are far from water sources, some areas have severe winter temperatures reaching minus forty degrees Celsius, and some areas have strong winds of around level ten.

In order to complete the entire line ahead of schedule, several thousand workers, students, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Urumqi participated in voluntary road construction and built sixty kilometers of roadbed in two months. With the struggle of the entire road-building army, the entire line project has progressed rapidly. Most of the main line project between Hami and Urumqi, which has been fully started, will be completed this winter. Bridge and culvert construction west of Urumqi to Shihezi has started successively, and the project from Shihezi to the border is undergoing preparations before construction and will start before the end of the year, braving the severe cold.

In order to overcome the difficulties brought by the severe winter to construction, the construction sites along the line are actively carrying out cold-weather protection work.

    兰新路冬季大施工
    几万名职工奋战铁路工地
    乌鲁木齐8日电　几万名职工大战铁路工地，兰新铁路近一千公里的沿线，冬季大规模施工的序幕已经揭开。
    兰新铁路今年冬季施工的规模很大，除了红柳河到哈密之间一百八十公里已经完工的路基要继续铺轨以外，从哈密到国境线一千几百公里的线路都要继续施工或陆续开工，中间有著名的低于海平面的内陆洼地吐鲁番盆地、隧道密集的天山达坂城隧道群和戈壁、沼泽地带等，工程非常艰巨，自然条件也比较差，有些戈壁距水源较远，有些地区冬季严寒达零下四十度，有些地区还有十级左右的大风。
    为了提前修通全线，乌鲁木齐市的职工、学生、解放军官兵几千人参加了义务修路，两个月就修起了六十公里路基。在全体修路大军的奋战下，全线工程飞跃进展，已经展开全面施工的哈密到乌鲁木齐间正线工程大部分都将在今冬修好，乌鲁木齐以西到石河子的桥涵已陆续开工修建，从石河子到国境的工程正进行施工前的准备工作，将在年底以前冒着严寒开工。
    为了战胜严冬对施工带来的困难，沿线工地正积极进行防寒工作。
