    Pioneer of Deep Plowing

    Yang Chang

    These days, across the vast fields from south to north, deep plowing forces are densely deployed, playing a magnificent prelude to even greater harvests next year. People are singing: "Unafraid of wind and rain, unafraid of the cold, deep plow the land to eight chi and three." Deep plowing the land, it is now a very common thing to say. But can you imagine what kind of struggle someone went through to take this step a few years ago?

    Let's take a look at the story of Ma Tongyi.

    This was more than four years ago. Ma Tongyi, the director of the Victory No. 1 Cooperative in Changge County, Henan Province, returned from a meeting in the county and decided to respond to the county party committee's call to conduct a high-yield experiment for 1,000 jin of grain per mu. At this time, the members began to discuss:

    "Want to harvest 1,000 jin of corn per mu? Wishful thinking! Really bragging without any investment." Member Hu Haisong said, "Last year, that one and a third mu of corn was fertilized with more than a dozen carts of manure and 100 jin of cake fertilizer, and it took a lot of effort to harvest 460 jin. Wanting to get 1,000 jin is impossible!"

    But Ma Tongyi thought: Since there is already a base of more than 400 jin, if we think of a way, we can definitely increase production. How can we increase production? How much can one mu yield at most? Ma Tongyi had no idea in his mind. At that time, he was just a young peasant with not much farming experience! He pondered for a long time and decided to ask Hu Jintai, who had been a hired farmhand for more than 30 years! When Jintai saw him coming to ask, he told him without hesitation: "There's no fixed way to grow crops; some yield a lot, some yield a little. If one piece of land is hoed deeper and more thoroughly, and another piece is hoed shallower and more carelessly, the harvest will differ greatly. As long as you dress up the land well, there's no problem in getting a thousand jin of corn per mu." Ma Tongyi listened and immediately gained strength. "Fat comes from the mouth, ears grow from the roots," "If you want to get a thousand jin, the land must be deeply plowed"… A series of ideas came into his mind.

    But at this time, there were more gossips:

    An agricultural technician said: "Deep plowing? No, no! The books say that the land can only be deepened by one inch per year. If it is plowed too deep, it will damage the soil."

    When Ma Tongyi heard that it could only be deepened by one inch per year, he got angry! He said, "If it can only be deepened by one inch a year, it will take ten years to deep plow by one chi, that's too slow! By the time socialism is built, the land will not have been liberated yet!" He, along with Vice Director Guo Linkui and a few others, discussed and first deep-plowed seven mu and nine fen of land for experimentation, planting White Horse Tooth corn.

    The corn stalks grew, but they were very thin and weak. Middle peasant Ma Yingen mocked, "This corn is not hard to get a thousand jin; the soil is thick! Just mix the soil in, wouldn't that be enough weight?"

    Ma Tongyi listened, although he didn't show any emotion, he was really worried in his heart. He had no choice but to keep watering and fertilizing the land. After a few days, although the corn stalks grew strong, they just didn't produce ears. At this time, rumors came again: "Director Ma's thousand-jin corn is really something; the stalks alone can weigh a thousand jin." "The corn stalks are really thick, just like Guangdong sugar cane; go to Guangdong to sell it! If no one else goes, I'll go." These words hit Ma Tongyi's heart like needles. But he still held his breath and continued to water and fertilize until the ears came out and the grains formed….

    The harvest season arrived. These seven mu and nine fen of land did not disappoint the painstaking efforts of Ma Tongyi and the others. The average yield was 810 jin of corn per mu, of which the one mu and two fen of land that was deep-plowed to more than one chi yielded an average of 1,073 jin per mu. Since then, deep plowing has increased their production year after year. This year, they harvested more than 12,900 jin of corn per mu. In several years of practice, Ma Tongyi and others have also created a set of deep plowing experience that separates live soil from dead soil, pays attention to the timing of plowing, and combines water, fertilizer, and soil.

    Now, the agricultural production cooperative originally led by Ma Tongyi has been merged into the Pohu People's Commune. Their commune is larger, has more land, and more people. They are deeply plowing that large area of golden land along with the song "Water is blood, manure is grain, deep plow the land and the granary is full"...

    深翻土地的先行者
    杨畅
    这几天，在从南到北的广阔田野上，密布着深翻土地的大军，为明年更大的丰收奏出雄伟的序曲。人们唱着：“不怕风雨不怕寒，深翻土地八尺三。”深翻土地这件事，现在说来已经是非常普遍的事了。可是，你能不能想到，在几年前，有人为了走这步路，曾经经过什么样的斗争？
    我们来看一下马同义的故事吧。
    这说来已经是四年多前的事了。河南省长葛县胜利一社社长马同义从县里开会回来，决定响应县委的号召，要搞千斤粮的丰产试验，这时社员们都议论开了：
    “要想一亩地打一千斤玉米？异想天开！真是吹大气不要本钱。”社员胡海松说：“去年那一亩三分玉米，上了十几车粪和一百斤饼肥，费了九牛二虎之力，才收了四百六十斤。要想搞千斤，不行啊！”
    可是马同义却想：既然有了四百多斤的底，再想想办法，一定还能增产。怎样才能增产呢？一亩地最多能打多少呢？马同义心里可没有谱。当时他只不过是个青年农民，种地的经验还不多啊！他捉摸了好久，决定去请教那作了三十几年雇农的胡金太吧！金太见他来问，毫不含糊地告诉他说：“种庄稼，没有样；有的打得多，有的打得少。一块地锄得深些，透些，另一块锄得浅些、马虎些，收成一差就是好多。只要把地打扮好，一亩玉米叫它打个千把斤没问题。”马同义听了，顿时添了一股劲。什么“膘从口上来，穗从根上生”、“要想搞千斤，土地要翻深”……一连串的想法都涌到他的脑子里来了。
    可是，这时候，闲话也就多了：
    一位农业技术员说：“深翻地？不行，不行！书上说的，土地只能一年加深耕一寸，翻得深了，反而要破坏土壤。”
    马同义一听说只能一年加深一寸，可火啦！他说：“如果一年只能加深一寸，要深翻一尺，就得十年，那么慢呀！等到那时候社会主义都建设好了，土地还没解放哩！”他，还有副社长郭林魁等几个人，商量着先深翻了七亩九分地作试验，种下了白马牙玉米。
    玉米长出秆子来了，可是精瘦精瘦的。中农马应恩嘲笑说，“这玉米不难千斤，土厚呀！把土掺打在里面，不就够分量了吗？”
    马同义听了，虽然没有动什么声色，心里可真有些着急。只好一个劲地往地里浇水追肥。过了些日子，玉米秆子虽然长得茁壮了，可就是不出穗。这时候，风言风语又来了：“马社长搞的千斤玉米真行，光秆就能打千斤。”“玉米秆长得真粗，活像广东甘蔗，上广东去卖吧！没人去我去。”这些话，一句句打在马同义的心坎上，像针扎一般。可是他还是沉住气照旧浇水施肥，直到出穗结粒……。
    收获的季节到了。这七亩九分地，没有辜负马同义等几个人的苦心经营，每亩平均打了八百一十斤玉米，其中深翻到一尺多的一亩二分地，平均每亩打了一千零七十三斤。从此，深翻土地，使他们连年都增了产。今年，他们一亩玉米收了一万二千九百多斤。在几年的实践中，马同义他们还创造了一套活土与死土分开、注意翻地时间和水肥土三结合的深翻经验。
    现在，马同义原来领导的农业生产合作社已经并入了坡胡人民公社。他们的社更大，地更多，人更众了。他们正在随着“水是血，粪是粮，深翻土地谷满仓”的歌声，深翻着那一大片一大片的黄澄澄的土地……。
