Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th: Japanese Communist Party Central Committee member Kawakami Kanichi pointed out in response to questions from the "Akahata" reporter that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people, as well as the people of Asian and African countries. He emphasized that launching a thorough struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet, and breaking their policy of hostility toward China, is the greatest task facing the Japanese people today.

Kawakami's response to the reporter's questions was published in today's "Akahata." He said that the Japanese people must strengthen their solidarity with the people of Asian countries and launch a struggle against the dangerous conspiracies plotted by U.S. imperialism and the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet in the Far East. Only in this way can they safeguard Japan's democracy and the people's basic rights, strive for peace and national independence, complete the national democratic revolution, and drive U.S. imperialism out of Asia.

Kawakami pointed out that the spirit of the joint statements issued by the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations delegation and the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation, which visited China some time ago, along with relevant Chinese organizations, lies here.

Kawakami said that now is the time for the Japanese working class to thoroughly recognize this point and stand up to fight.

Kawakami pointed out that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the Japan-Chiang "Treaty" are the foundation of the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet's policy of hostility toward China. Problems such as the United States' establishment of military bases in Japan, the transportation of nuclear weapons into Japan, the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," the attempt to establish an anti-communist military alliance, and the use of U.S. military bases in Okinawa, Japan, and Taiwan to launch aggression against China all stem from this.

Kawakami said that if the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet does not completely abolish these "treaties" and sever relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, then it cannot be said that the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet has comprehensively changed its policy of hostility toward China.

Kawakami said that if anyone thinks that it is possible to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations without abolishing the Japan-Chiang "Treaty," such an idea can only give the Japanese people illusions and, in practice, is equivalent to assisting U.S. imperialism's policy of aggressive war and acting as a partner in U.S. imperialism's policy of aggressive war. This is the most dangerous idea.

Kawakami emphasized the Chinese people's firm will to oppose U.S. imperialism and to liberate their territory of Taiwan.

### 日共中央委员川上贯一指出  美帝国主义是亚非人民公敌  日本人民必须打破岸信介敌视中国的政策

    日共中央委员川上贯一指出
    美帝国主义是亚非人民公敌
    日本人民必须打破岸信介敌视中国的政策
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员川上贯一在答复“赤旗报”记者提出的问题时指出，美帝国主义是日本人民和中国人民以及亚非各国人民的共同敌人。他强调指出，对美帝国主义和岸信介内阁展开彻底的斗争，打破它们敌视中国的政策，这是日本人民目前最大的课题。
    川上这篇对记者的谈话刊登在今天的“赤旗报”上。他说，日本人民必须加强同亚洲各国人民的团结，展开反对美帝国主义和岸信介内阁在远东策划的危险阴谋的斗争；只有这样，才能维护日本的民主和人民的基本权利，争取和平与民族独立，完成民族民主革命，并且把美帝国主义从亚洲驱逐出去。
    川上指出，前些时候访问中国的日本恢复日中邦交国民会议代表团和日中友好协会代表团等同中国有关团体发表的共同声明的精神也就在这里。
    川上说，现在是日本工人阶级彻底认清这一点，并且站起来奋斗的时候了。
    川上指出，日美“安全条约”和日蒋“条约”是岸信介内阁敌视中国政策的基础，美国在日本境内设置军事基地和把核武器运进日本、制造“两个中国”的阴谋、企图建立反共军事同盟、利用冲绳和日本以及台湾的美军基地对中国发动侵略等问题都是由此产生的。
    川上说，岸信介内阁没有完全废除这些“条约”，断绝同蒋介石集团的关系，那就不能说岸信介内阁全面地改变了它敌视中国的政策。
    川上说，如果有人想不废除日蒋“条约”也能够恢复日中邦交，这样的想法只能给日本人民以幻想，而且在实际上等于协助美帝国主义的侵略战争政策和充当美帝国主义的侵略战争政策的伙伴。这是最危险的思想。
    川上强调指出了中国人民反对美帝国主义和一定要解放自己领土台湾的坚决意志。
