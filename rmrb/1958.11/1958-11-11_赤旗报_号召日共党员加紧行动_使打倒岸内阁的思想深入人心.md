Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper today published an editorial calling on the Japanese people to expose the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's conspiracy of so-called "normalization of Diet sessions" and to urge the dissolution of the Diet.

The editorial pointed out that the Japanese democratic forces' struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," with the support of broad public opinion, has driven the Kishi Nobusuke government into a dead end. However, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet shamelessly played the old tune of "upholding parliamentary politics" and "normalizing Diet sessions" in an attempt to deceive public opinion and realize its conspiracy to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law."

The editorial pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is attempting to use these clichés to paralyze public opinion against the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, induce the people to recognize its illegal extension of the Diet's extraordinary session, and induce the Socialist Party to continue participating in Diet sessions. At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet wants to divert the people's attention to the so-called "normalization of Diet sessions" and take the opportunity to pour cold water on the people's growing struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

The "Akahata" stated that the Socialist Party declared that the Diet's extraordinary session had ended, the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" had been invalidated, and decided to have its members return to their constituencies to expose the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party's atrocities in order to carry out a movement demanding the dissolution of the Diet. The Japanese Communist Party fully supports this policy.

The "Akahata" condemned Kishi Nobusuke's remarks to reporters on the 7th, in which he stated that he would pass the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" no matter what, and that he would formulate a series of reactionary laws such as the "Anti-Espionage Law" in the future. The newspaper pointed out that this is the fundamental attitude of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party, and that this attitude has not changed in any way.

The editorial pointed out that the Liberal Democratic Party's actions to undermine parliamentary politics are not accidental. On the one hand, it is subordinate to the United States, and on the other hand, it wants to revive militarism. In any case, the Liberal Democratic Party will ultimately undermine parliamentary politics with its own hands and take all adventurous means. This is the root cause of the current dangerous political situation and the dangerous fascist character of the Liberal Democratic Party.

The "Akahata" called on all members of the Japanese Communist Party to thoroughly expose the dangerous essence of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party and the conspiracy of "normalization of Diet sessions," to deeply root the idea of overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet in the people, and to organize the people's anger at the Liberal Democratic Party's atrocities in order to crush its conspiracy to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law," dissolve the Diet, and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

    “赤旗报”号召日共党员加紧行动
    使打倒岸内阁的思想深入人心
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本人民揭穿岸信介内阁的所谓“国会会议正常化”的阴谋，并且促使国会解散。
    社论指出，日本民主力量反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争，在广泛人民舆论的支持下，已经迫使岸信介政府走投无路。但是，岸信介内阁竟然厚颜无耻地弹起了“拥护议会政治”和“国会会议正常化”的滥调，企图欺骗人民舆论，企图实现修改“警察官职务执行法”的阴谋。
    社论指出，岸信介内阁是企图用这些滥调来麻痹反对岸信介内阁的舆论，并且诱使人民承认它非法延长国会临时会议会期的决议，诱使社会党继续参加国会会议；同时，岸信介内阁是要把人民的注意力转移到所谓“国会会议正常化”的问题上去，趁机给日益高涨的反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的人民的斗争浇冷水。
    “赤旗报”表示，社会党宣告国会临时会议已经结束“警察官职务执行法修正案”已经作废，并且决定使它的议员回到自己的选区从事揭露岸信介内阁和自由民主党的暴行的工作，以开展要求解散国会的运动，日本共产党完全支持这个方针。
    “赤旗报”谴责岸信介7日对记者发表的谈话，岸信介曾经表示他无论如何要通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”，而且今后还要制订“防谍法”等一系列的反动法律。报纸指出，这是岸信介政府和自由民主党的根本态度，这种态度至今没有任何改变。
    社论指出，自由民主党破坏议会政治的行动并不是偶然发生的。它一方面从属于美国，同时又要复活军国主义，不管怎样，自由民主党终是要用自己的手来破坏议会政治和采取一切冒险手段的。这是目前险恶的政治形势的发生和自由民主党危险的法西斯性格的产生的根源。
    “赤旗报”号召日共全体党员彻底揭露岸信介内阁和自由民主党危险的本质和“国会会议正常化”的阴谋，使打倒岸信介内阁的思想深入人民，把人民对自由民主党的暴行的怒火组织起来，以便粉碎它修改“警察官职务执行法”的阴谋，并且解散国会，打倒岸信介内阁。
