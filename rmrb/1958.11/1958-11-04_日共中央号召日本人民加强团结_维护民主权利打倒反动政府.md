Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 3rd: According to TASS, Tokyo, November 3rd: On the eve of November 5th - the National Unified Action Day against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party called on all Japanese people to rise up against the reactionary forces' attack on the democratic rights of the Japanese people.

The JCP Central Committee pointed out that many trade unions, scientists, cultural figures, news and broadcasting workers' groups, women, youth, and farmers' organizations in Japan have issued statements opposing the revision of this law.

The JCP Central Committee today called on people from all walks of life in the "Akahata" newspaper to support the working class, which is at the forefront of the opposition to the reactionary forces' attack. The JCP Central Committee also demanded the dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet.

The newspaper also published an appeal from Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, to Japanese Communist Party members. The appeal pointed out the reactionary nature of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet and stated that the victorious conduct of the united struggle on November 5th is an extremely important task for all Japanese Communist Party members and the entire party, as the party leads the Japanese people in the struggle to defend peace, independence, democracy, and freedom. Nosaka called on Japanese Communist Party members to more resolutely and more firmly crush the threats of violence used by the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party.
