China, Soviet Uzbekistan, Poland Weightlifting Competition - Day 1
Huang Qianghui Sets World Record in Lightweight Clean and Jerk

Beijing, November 29th – Last night at the Beijing Gymnasium, the weightlifting competition between China, Soviet Uzbekistan, and Poland featured the flyweight, bantamweight, and lightweight classes. Chinese athletes Chen Jingkai and Huang Qianghui secured first place in the flyweight and lightweight classes with total scores of 322.5 kg and 388 kg, respectively. Uzbek athlete Danilin claimed first place in the bantamweight class with a total score of 330 kg.

In the lightweight competition, Chinese athlete Huang Qianghui successfully lifted 158 kg in the clean and jerk, breaking the lightweight clean and jerk world record of 157.5 kg set by Singapore's Tan Howe Liang in July of this year. Huang Qianghui's new record was achieved on his second attempt. He successfully lifted 147.5 kg on his first attempt, and then requested to attempt 158 kg. He completed the lift to chest, stand, and jerk movements cleanly and with ease. He lifted so effortlessly that it seemed he had the potential to lift even heavier. He did not request another attempt.

After weighing, Huang Qianghui's weight was 67.4 kg, with both his weight and the barbell meeting the standards.

Uzbekistan's Petrosov secured second place in the lightweight competition with a total score of 355 kg. His snatch result reached 117.5 kg, breaking the Uzbekistan Republic record of 115 kg. Poland's Kciuk took third place in this class with a score of 340 kg.

The flyweight competition was intensely competitive. Only China's Chen Jingkai and Uzbekistan's F. Lee participated in this class. F. Lee performed better than Chen Jingkai in both the press and snatch. Chen Jingkai also experienced several leg cramps during the attempts, resulting in F. Lee leading Chen Jingkai by 12.5 kg after the press and snatch events. Therefore, the clean and jerk became crucial for Chen Jingkai's chances of winning. F. Lee successfully lifted 120 kg on his first attempt but failed on his second attempt at 125 kg. Subsequently, he attempted to break the all-Soviet flyweight clean and jerk record of 132.5 kg with a weight of 133 kg on two occasions, but failed both times. Chen Jingkai only needed to lift 135 kg to win. Chen Jingkai successfully lifted 125 kg on his first attempt. On his second attempt at 135 kg, he failed because the barbell tilted forward, and he could not stand steady. He successfully lifted 135 kg on his third attempt, winning against F. Lee. He then requested a fourth attempt at 142.5 kg, a weight that broke his own world best record of 140.5 kg set in September of this year. He conquered the weight of 142.5 kg, but because he drank some salt water for his leg cramps, his weight exceeded one kilogram, so the result and the record were not counted. F. Lee's total score was 320 kg.

In the bantamweight competition, Uzbekistan's Danilin secured first place, while Poland's Jankowski took second place with a total score of 300 kg. China's You Jiadong failed in all three clean and jerk attempts and did not achieve a total score.

Yesterday's referees were Polish international referee Kohapevsky Tadeusz, Chinese national referee Zeng Weiqi, and Soviet Uzbekistan Republic referee Ah Waniesov.

The middleweight, light heavyweight, middle heavyweight, and heavyweight classes will be held this afternoon. (Photo attached)

    中国、苏联乌兹别克、波兰举重赛第一天
    黄强辉创轻量级挺举世界纪录
    本报讯　昨晚在北京体育馆举行的中国、苏联乌兹别克、波兰举重赛进行了最轻量、次轻和轻量三个级的比赛，中国运动员陈镜开和黄强辉分别以三二二点五公斤和三百八十八公斤的总成绩获得最轻级和轻量级的第一名。乌兹别克运动员达尼林以三百三十公斤的总成绩获得次轻级第一名。
    在轻量级比赛中，我国运动员黄强辉，挺起了一百五十八公斤，打破了新加坡陈浩亮在今年7月创造的一百五十七点五公斤的轻量级挺举世界纪录。黄强辉挺举新成绩是第二次试举时创造的。他第一次成功地举起了一百四十七点五公斤，接着他就要求试举一百五十八公斤。他很干净俐落地完成了提铃至胸、站立和上挺动作。他举得那样轻松，看来他还有潜力，可以举起更高的重量。他没有再要求试举。
    经过称量，黄强辉的体重是六十七点四公斤，体重和槓铃都合乎标准。
    获得轻量级比赛第二名的是乌兹别克的彼特罗索夫，他的总成绩是三百五十五公斤，他的推举成绩达到一百一十七点五公斤，破一百一十五公斤的乌兹别克共和国纪录。波兰的克秋克获得这一级的第三名，他的成绩是三百四十公斤。
    最轻级比赛竞争剧烈。这一级只有我国陈镜开和乌兹别克的弗·李参加。弗·李的推举和抓举都比陈镜开好，陈镜开在试举中腿又几次抽筋，所以推抓两项结束时，弗·李已比陈镜开多了十二点五公斤。因此，挺举成了陈镜开能不能获胜的关键。弗·李第一次试举一百二十公斤成功，第二次试举一百二十五公斤失败，接着，他又两次试举打破一百三十二点五公斤的全苏最轻级挺举纪录的重量一百三十三公斤，两次都没有成功。陈镜开只要挺起一百三十五公斤就可获胜了。陈镜开第一次试举一百二十五公斤成功，第二次试举一百三十五公斤，因槓铃前倾没有站稳，失败了。第三次试举一百三十五公斤成功了，赢了弗·李。接着他第四次要求试举一百四十二点五公斤，这个重量打破今年9月间他自己创造的世界最好成绩一百四十点五公斤。一百四十二点五公斤这个重量被他征服了，但因为腿抽筋喝了些盐水体重超过一公斤，不算成绩，也不算纪录。弗·李的总成绩是三百二十公斤。
    次轻级比赛乌兹别克的达尼林获第一，波兰的杨可夫斯基以三百公斤的总成绩获第二。我国尤家栋在挺举中三次失败，没有总成绩。
    昨天执行裁判的是波兰的国际裁判科哈培夫斯基·塔德乌施、中国国家裁判曾维祺、苏联乌兹别克共和国裁判阿华聂索夫。
    中量级、轻重级、次重级和重量级四个级的比赛定今天下午进行。（附图片）
