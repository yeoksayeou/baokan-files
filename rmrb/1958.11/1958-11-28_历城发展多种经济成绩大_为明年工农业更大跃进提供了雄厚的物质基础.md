Licheng Achieves Great Success in Developing Diversified Economy, Providing a Solid Material Foundation for a Greater Leap Forward in Industry and Agriculture Next Year

(Our Correspondent Hu Lei reports) Licheng County, Shandong Province, while vigorously developing industrial and agricultural production, has dispatched 100,000 people to form a subsidiary production army, setting off a high tide in subsidiary and diversified economic production. Now this force has enlivened seven major industries and more than 130 projects in an all-round way. The widespread development of this movement has not only strongly supported the current industrial and agricultural production and the needs of urban people's lives, but also greatly improved the lives of the broad masses of commune members. At the same time, it will also provide a solid material foundation for a greater leap forward in industry and agriculture next year.

The county has a population of 710,000, with mountains, rivers, hills, and plains, and is close to Jinan City, with excellent conditions for developing sideline occupations and diversified economies. However, in the period of advanced agricultural cooperatives, due to the small size and limited strength of the cooperatives, activities were not carried out well enough. After the establishment of people's communes in September, the superiority was greatly brought into play. In the past four months or so, the income from diversified economic production reached more than 37.3 million yuan, an increase of more than 35% over the same period last year, averaging 52.1 yuan per person in the county. After the autumn harvest and planting, the Licheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China formed a professional army of 100,000 people to comprehensively carry out the "Thirteen Breedings" movement in seven major industries, including breeding, transportation, weaving, medicinal materials, vegetables, agricultural product processing, and building material production. The scale of agricultural and sideline product processing industry is also unprecedented, including more than 20 kinds of oil extraction, vermicelli, cotton, cotton firewood bark, sweet potatoes, fruits, etc. The sweet potato alone has seven or eight kinds of processing industries such as brewing, grinding flour (vermicelli, starch), alcohol, pickles, pastries, and sugar. Most of the county's 8 billion catties of sweet potatoes, except for human consumption, are used as industrial raw materials. The county's gas and gasoline pumps are all prepared to be driven by alcohol made from sweet potatoes. The medicinal material industry has more than 70 kinds of medicinal scorpions, gourds, and Jingjie. The weaving industry has 17 kinds of strip weaving, straw weaving, etc. The building materials production includes five items: bricks, tiles, lime, stone, cement, and artificial coal (made from bay mud, weeds, and salt, which can replace good coal). The transportation industry has 552 large and small vehicles for dedicated line transportation. It is estimated that by March next year, the net income from the above-mentioned seven major industries will be 33.4 million yuan. If this plan is realized, each person can get more than 47 yuan.

The county's diversified economic production has greatly played its role. First of all, it overfulfilled the sales task. The sales task of live pigs was 50,000 heads, and the actual supply was more than 55,800 heads. The original task of selling 70,000 chickens was actually completed with more than 100,000 chickens. In the autumn, the communes drew more than 15.7 million yuan from diversified economic income to support industrial and agricultural production, including the construction of 11,530 iron smelting furnaces, the purchase of 40 water pumps, 18 tractors, and a large number of pesticides and fertilizers, and 11.61 million yuan was distributed to commune members as the first batch of wages. The Licheng County Party Committee said in summarizing the significance of developing diversified economy: "The good development of this movement is not only limited to the above-mentioned role, but more importantly, it prepares funds and all the necessary materials for the great leap forward in industry and agriculture next year. If we do not engage in sideline occupations this winter, it will be difficult to solve the funds for agricultural production next year."

In leading this movement, the Licheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted a series of new measures based on the new situation of people's communes and the great leap forward in industry and agriculture this year, and gradually developed it. At the beginning of the movement, some cadres at all levels showed wrong ideas such as attaching importance to grain production and neglecting diversified operations; they were willing to engage in large-scale production or relying on higher authorities to use foreign methods, and were unwilling to engage in "small indigenous groups." The County Party Committee believes that solving these ideas is the first hurdle. Therefore, it raised the question among the whole party and the whole people: What are the differences between engaging in sideline occupations this year and in the past? What is the relationship between diversified economy and industrial and agricultural production and people's lives? Is it enough to have only grain? A large-scale debate was conducted. From the debate, five new situations were analyzed:

(1) The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production requires the cooperation of diversified economy, and sideline and diversified economic production must also make a great leap forward. (2) People's living standards have improved, and there is an urgent need to increase non-staple food. (3) People's lives have become collectivized, and the scattered sideline occupations that were done in the past must also be unified by the commune, otherwise they will stagnate. (4) To meet the needs of carrying out technical revolution and running industries by the commune, new products must be developed. (5) The implementation of the wage system in the commune requires a large amount of cash, and the commune also has the conditions to comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. These vivid situations sounded the alarm for everyone and unified their understanding. On this basis, the County Party Committee closely grasped five issues to achieve specific leadership: (1) Comprehensively planning and strengthening leadership. Based on the industrial and agricultural plans and the needs of the people's lives, plans were made at all levels. The county established a sideline occupation office, with the secretary in command, and transferred 500 cadres from the county to the commune to specifically lead sideline occupations. In addition, 500 to 700 technical cadres were trained to enrich the various units; and a group of party members were developed in the sideline occupation army to strengthen the specific leadership of the party. (2) Tapping labor potential and establishing a professional army. Each happiness home established a chicken farm, and 50,000 auxiliary laborers were used. (3) Strengthening technical guidance and running various short-term training courses in sideline occupations and diversified economy. For example, in chicken farming, technicians for warming chickens are prepared to be trained. (4) Strengthening production management and appropriately dividing labor according to the content of diversified economy. (5) Widely adopting the contract system to solve the difficulties of raw materials in many ways. The county has signed a large number of purchase and sales contracts with relevant departments in the province and city; production, supply, and sales contract systems have also been carried out between communes, and contract purchases have been carried out across county and provincial boundaries.

    历城发展多种经济成绩大
    为明年工农业更大跃进提供了雄厚的物质基础
    本报讯　记者胡雷报道：山东历城县在大搞工农业生产的同时，分出十万人马，组成一支副业大军，掀起副业、多种经济生产高潮。现在这支人马已经使七大行业、一百三十多个项目全面活跃起来。这一运动的广泛开展，不仅有力地支援了当前工农业生产和城市人民生活的需要，而且大大改善了广大社员的生活，同时还将为明年工农业更大跃进提供雄厚的物质基础。
    这个县共有七十一万人口，有山有水，有丘陵有平原，还靠近济南市，发展副业、多种经济的条件极好。但是在高级农业社时期，由于社小力薄，活动的还不够好，9月间人民公社化后，大大发挥了优越性，近四个多月来，多种经济生产收入，即达三千七百多万元，比去年同期增加35％以上，全县平均每人五十二元一角。秋收、秋种后，中共历城县委组成一支包括十万人的专业大军，全面搞起了饲养、运输、编织、药材、蔬菜、农产品加工、建筑材料生产等七大行业，一百三十多项多种经济生产。饲养业开展了猪、牛、羊、骡、马、驴、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔、蜂、鱼、蚕等“十三养”运动。农副产品加工业的规模也是空前的，计有：榨油、粉条、棉花、棉柴皮、地瓜、果品等二十多种，只地瓜一项即有酿酒、磨粉（粉条、淀粉）、酒精、咸菜、糕点、糖等七、八类加工业，全县八十多亿斤地瓜，除人吃以外，大部分供作工业原料。全县的煤汽抽水机和汽油机，都准备用地瓜制成的酒精开动。药材业有药蝎子、瓜篓、荆介等七十多种。编织业有条编、草编等十七种。建筑材料生产有砖瓦、石灰、石料、水泥、人造煤（用湾泥、杂草、食盐混合做成，可顶好煤用）等五项。运输业有五百五十二辆大、小车专线运输。上述七大行业，到明年3月，再生产纯收入三千三百四十万元，如果实现这个计划，平均每人还可得到四十七元多。
    这个县的多种经济生产，已经大大发挥了作用。首先是超额完成了出售任务，生猪出售任务是五万头，实际供应了五万五千八百多头，原定出售鸡的任务七万只，实际完成了十万多只。各公社在秋季从多种经济收入中抽出一千五百七十多万元支援工、农业生产，计建成一万一千五百三十个炼铁炉，购买了四十部抽水机、十八部拖拉机以及大批农药、化肥等，还抽出一千一百六十一万元给社员发了第一批工资。历城县委在总结开展多种经济的意义时说：“这一运动开展的好，还不仅限于上述作用，更重要的是为明年工农业大跃进准备资金和一切需要的物资，如果今冬不搞副业，明年农业生产的资金就不好解决。”
    中共历城县委在领导这一运动中，是根据今年人民公社化和工农业大跃进的新形势，采取了一系列的新措施，逐步开展起来的。运动开始，各级干部中间，出现重粮食生产轻多种经营；愿搞大宗的或依靠上级用洋法生产，不愿搞“小土群”等错误思想。县委认为解决这些思想是第一关，因此在全党全民中，提出今年搞副业和过去有那些不同？多种经济和工农业生产及人民生活有什么关系？光有粮食行不行等题目，进行大鸣大放大辩论，从辩论中，分析到五个新情况：
  （1）工农业生产大跃进需要多种经济配合，副业多种经济也必须大跃进。（2）人民生活提高了，迫切要求增加副食品。（3）人民生活集体化了，过去分散干的零星副业，也必须由社统一搞起来，否则就要停顿。（4）适应开展技术革命和公社办工业的需要，必须开辟新产品。（5）公社实行工资制需要大批现金，而且公社也有条件使农林牧副渔全面发展。这些活生生的情况给大家敲起了警钟，统一了认识。在此基础上县委紧紧抓住五个问题实现具体领导：（1）全面规划加强领导。根据工农业计划和人民生活需要，层层作出规划。县建立了副业办公室，书记挂帅，从县到社抽出五百名干部，专门领导副业，另训练五百至七百名技术干部，充实到各单位；并在副业大军中发展一批党员，加强党的具体领导。（2）挖掘劳动潜力，建立专业军，各幸福院设立养鸡场，附属劳力用起五万名。（3）加强技术指导，开办各种副业多种经济短期训练班。如养鸡，准备训练暖鸡技术员等。（4）加强生产管理，根据多种经济内容，适当分工。（5）广泛采用合同制，多方解决原料困难。县和省、市有关部门，已经订立了大批包购包销合同；各公社之间也开展产供销合同制，并且打破县界、省界进行合同采购。
