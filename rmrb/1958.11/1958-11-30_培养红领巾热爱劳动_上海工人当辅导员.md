Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th. Shanghai's Hongkou District has hired over 120 workers from seven primary schools to serve as Young Pioneer counselors. This has greatly contributed to cultivating children's love for labor and love for working people.

These worker counselors are all outstanding Communist Youth League members from factories near the schools. They are very enthusiastic about the Young Pioneer work. They use their rest time and holidays to go to the schools to conduct counseling activities, going deep into the squadrons to talk with the members, paying close attention to political and ideological education. When some Young Pioneers from Sichuan North Road No. 1 Primary School went to the Dalu Golden Pen Factory to participate in labor, some children felt that the labor of folding the golden pen instruction manuals was too simple and meaningless. Counselor Huang Fushan, in response to this thinking, educated the members. He said that before liberation, golden pens were all imported from foreign countries. Now, we not only can manufacture them ourselves, but we also export them abroad. If we fold the instruction manuals carelessly, it will damage the country's reputation when they are taken abroad. The members realized the meaning of their labor and took it seriously. Chen Zhigang, a counselor at Haining Road No. 1 Primary School, learned that there were few children from worker and peasant families in the squadron he was counseling, so he focused on explaining the principle of "eating and wearing depend on labor, and building socialism depends on workers and peasants."

In addition to being responsible for educating children themselves, the counselors often invite the factory's CYL secretary to give political lessons to the children, or organize the children to meet with the factory's advanced producers and other activities to educate the members on the situation of the Great Leap Forward.

    培养红领巾热爱劳动
    上海工人当辅导员
    据新华社上海29日电　上海市虹口区七所小学校聘请一百二十多个工人担任少先队辅导员，对培养儿童树立热爱劳动、热爱劳动人民的思想有很大作用。
    这些工人辅导员都是学校邻近的工厂的优秀共青团员，他们对少先队工作非常热心，都是利用休息时间、假日到学校去进行辅导活动，深入中队找队员谈心，很注意政治思想教育。四川北路第一小学部分少先队员去大陆金笔厂参加劳动，在折叠金笔的说明书时，有些孩子认为这种劳动太简单了，没有意思。辅导员黄福山针对这一思想情况，就向队员们进行教育。他说，解放以前金笔都是从外国运来的，现在我们不但会自己制造，而且还要运销国外。如果马马虎虎折叠说明书，拿出去会有损国家声誉。队员认识到自己劳动的意义，就都认真地对待了。海宁路第一小学辅导员陈志刚了解到他所辅导的中队队员工农子弟很少，他就着重讲解“吃、穿靠劳动，建设社会主义靠工农”的道理。
    辅导员们除了自己负责教育儿童以外，还经常邀请工厂的团委书记给儿童们上政治课，或者组织儿童与工厂的先进生产者见面等活动，向队员们进行大跃进形势的教育。
