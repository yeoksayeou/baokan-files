    On the Question of the Occupation Regime in Berlin

    On the 10th, Soviet Premier Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union was prepared to transfer its authority to administer Berlin, which is still being exercised by Soviet agencies, to the independent and autonomous German Democratic Republic. He also said that "it is now obvious that the states that signed the Potsdam Agreement should abandon the remnants of the occupation regime in Berlin."

    Berlin was liberated by the Soviet Red Army on May 2, 1945. It is now the capital of the German Democratic Republic. However, to this day, Berlin is still under the occupation of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, which are divided into sectors. The United States, Britain, and France are taking advantage of the occupation of Berlin to effectively control West Berlin, making it a state within a state, and using it to constantly create international tensions.

    Basis of Occupation

    The occupation of Germany and Berlin was determined by the Crimean Declaration of the Heads of Government of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain on February 11, 1945, the Potsdam Agreement of August 3 of the same year, and other related agreements. The Crimean Declaration stipulated that "the forces of the three powers shall each occupy a zone within Germany" (France later also participated in the occupation). Article 7 of the "Joint Declaration of the Four Powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the Control of Germany" on June 5, 1945, stipulates that the administration of the "Greater Berlin" area "shall be subject to the direction of the Allied Control Authority, which shall be subordinate to the Control Council (i.e., the Allied Control Council, composed of the four commanders-in-chief) and shall be composed of the four commanders." After the surrender of Hitler's Germany in May 1945, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France divided Germany into four occupation zones, and the "Greater Berlin" area was also divided into four occupation zones.

        Two Approaches

    The Crimean Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement repeatedly emphasized that the Allies' "unyielding goal is to destroy German militarism and Nazism and ensure that Germany will never again disturb world peace." However, in the process of occupying and controlling Germany, two fundamentally different lines can be clearly seen from historical facts. The United States, Britain, and France violated the most important principles of the Crimean Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement, and they implemented a policy of restoring German militarism and splitting Germany. In the occupation zones of Western countries, militarists were not only not purged, but gradually rose to power and reassumed important positions. On January 1, 1947, the occupation zones of the United States and Britain merged to form the so-called Bizone. In 1948, the French occupation zone was also merged to form the so-called Trizone. In April 1949, the United States, Britain, and France announced the Occupation Statute; in May, the three countries unilaterally formulated the so-called "Bonn Constitution," and on September 20 of the same year, the Federal Republic of Germany was established. The occupation forces of the United States, Britain, and France in West Germany have also been transformed into "garrison troops" that will be stationed for fifty years under the so-called "General Treaty" of 1952. On May 5, 1955, the United States, Britain, and France signed a declaration ending the occupation of West Germany, announcing that the Occupation Statute was abolished.

    The Soviet Union, on the other hand, acted entirely in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. In the Soviet occupation zone, militarist and fascist forces were purged, and German democratic and progressive forces flourished. On October 7, 1949, at the request of the German people, the German Democratic Republic was proclaimed. In May 1953, the Soviet Council of Ministers decided to abolish the Soviet Control Commission in Germany and remove the Soviet military commander's control duties in the German Democratic Republic. From then on, his activities were limited to commanding the Soviet troops stationed in Germany. On January 25, 1955, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order ending the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany. The German Democratic Republic became a fully sovereign and independent state.

        A Malignant Tumor

    After tearing up the Potsdam Agreement, the United States, Britain, and France retained the power to occupy Berlin, with the aim of using West Berlin to create tensions and threaten the security of Democratic Germany.

    On June 18, 1948, the United States, Britain, and France arbitrarily carried out a separate currency reform in the Western occupation zones, issuing the new Deutschmark in an attempt to use this currency to undermine the economy of the Soviet occupation zone. In order to protect the interests of the German people and the economy of the Soviet occupation zone, the Soviet military command decided to restrict traffic between Berlin and the Western occupation zones. The Western countries, led by the United States, greatly intimidated and clamored for a "military solution" to the Soviet Union's self-defense measures, while implementing so-called "air supply." After the military intimidation failed, they began negotiations with the Soviet Union in August 1948. The Western countries finally agreed to stop using the new Deutschmark in Berlin, and the Soviet side also guaranteed traffic between the Western occupation zones and West Berlin. However, the United States, Britain, and France did not fulfill their promises. This is the so-called "Berlin problem."

    After creating the "Berlin problem," the Western countries launched a war provocation in 1953, using West Berlin as a base. On June 17 of that year, a large number of special agents and thugs who were stationed on the border between East and West Berlin and who had infiltrated the democratic areas, launched a planned riot at the same time with a signal. They incited people everywhere, smashed and looted shops, set fire to workers' clubs and workers' dormitories, and attempted to attack central government agencies. These armed bandits took advantage of the chaos to attack people's police and Soviet soldiers. They broke into the court, burned files and released Nazi murderers. While the riots were in progress, American officers were directing thugs in the streets of Berlin, and American broadcast vehicles were also inciting and issuing instructions to the thugs; American military aircraft distributed pre-printed leaflets inciting riots. However, this provocative incident was crushed within twenty-four hours.

    On April 22, 1956, another scandal of the American occupiers was revealed. On this day, the Soviet troops in Berlin discovered a secret underground tunnel dug by the American espionage agency in the territory of the German Democratic Republic. This tunnel was equipped with a telephone listening station. Several wires were laid along the underground tunnel from the American occupation zone in Berlin and connected to the telephone lines used by the Soviet army.

        Must End

    The above facts alone are sufficient to prove that the United States, Britain, and France continue to occupy West Berlin, intending to use it as a center for conducting the Cold War and a center for espionage activities. In particular, as West Germany is stepping up its atomic armament and fascization, West Berlin is likely to become a springboard for the Bonn regime's policy of aggression. These situations are clearly contrary to the German people's desire for Berlin to become a city of peace and the final unification of the country. The occupation regime in Berlin should and must be ended. (Xi)

    关于占领柏林制度问题
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在10日宣布，苏联方面准备把至今仍由苏联机构执行的管理柏林的职权移交给独立自主的德意志民主共和国。他并且说，现在“显然已经是签订波茨坦协定的国家应当放弃占领柏林制度的残余的时候了”。
    柏林是1945年5月2日由苏联红军解放的。它现在是德意志民主共和国的首都。但是迄今为止，柏林仍由美、英、法、苏四国分区占领着，美英法三国正是利用占领柏林的便利，实际控制着西柏林，使之成为一个国家中的国家，并利用它不断制造国际紧张局势。
    占领的根据
    对德国和柏林的占领是根据1945年2月11日苏美英三国政府首脑克里米亚声明和同年8月3日波茨坦协定及其他有关协议而确定的。克里米亚声明中规定：“三国部队将于德境各别占领一个区域”（法国后来也参加占领）。1945年6月5日的“苏美英法四国关于管制德国的联合声明”中第七条规定：“大柏林”区的行政“将遵照盟国管制当局的指挥，此一管制机构受管制委员会（即盟国管制委员会，由四国总司令组成）之节制，将由四（国）指挥官组成”。1945年5月希特勒德国投降以后，苏美英法四国即分区占领德国，“大柏林”区亦分为四个占领区。
        两种做法
    克里米亚声明和波茨坦协定，都一再强调，盟国“不屈不挠之目的，乃在毁灭德国军国主义及纳粹主义，并保证德国将永不能再扰乱世界和平”。但在占领和管制德国的过程中，可以从历史事实中很清楚地看到两条根本不同的路线。美英法三国破坏了克里米亚声明和波茨坦协定的最重要的原则，它们执行的是恢复德国军国主义和分裂德国的政策。在西方国家占领区，军国主义分子不仅没有被肃清，反而逐渐抬头，并且又重新执掌要职了。1947年1月1日美英两国的占领区合并，成立所谓双占区。1948年法国占领区也并了进去，成立所谓三占区。1949年4月美英法宣布了占领法规；5月，三国并片面制订所谓“波恩宪法”，同年9月20日成立了德意志联邦共和国。美英法三国原在西德的占领军也已根据1952年的所谓“一般性条约”而一变成为将要驻扎五十年的“驻军”。1955年5月5日，美英法三国签署了结束对西德占领的宣言，宣布占领法规作废。
    苏联方面则完全按照波茨坦协定办事。在苏占区，军国主义和法西斯势力被肃清了，德国民主和进步力量蓬勃发展了起来。在1949年10月7日，根据德国人民的要求，德意志民主共和国宣布成立。1953年5月，苏联部长会议决定，撤销苏联对德管制委员会，解除苏军司令在德意志民主共和国内的管制职务，以后他的活动仅限于指挥驻德苏军。1955年1月25日苏联最高苏维埃主席团发布命令，结束苏德间战争状态。德意志民主共和国成为主权完整的独立国家。
        一个毒瘤
    美英法三国在撕毁了波茨坦协定后，仍保留着占领柏林的权力，其目的是要利用西柏林来制造紧张局势和威胁民主德国的安全。
    1948年6月18日，美英法三国在西占区擅自实行单独的货币改革，发行新马克，企图利用这种货币破坏苏占区的经济。苏军指挥部为了保障德国人民的利益和苏占区的经济，决定限制柏林和西方占领区间的交通。以美国为首的西方国家对苏联的自卫措施大事恫吓并叫嚣“武力解决”，一面并实行所谓“空中供应”。在武力恫吓破产之后，于1948年8月间才开始与苏联谈判，西方国家终于答复停止新马克在柏林使用，苏联方面也保证西方占领区和西柏林之间的交通。但是美英法方面并未履行它们的诺言。这就是通常所谓的“柏林问题”。
    西方国家在制造“柏林问题”之后，又于1953年以西柏林为根据地进行了一次战争挑衅。在这一年的6月17日，守俟在柏林东西区边界上的以及潜入民主区的大批特务和暴徒，在一声号令下一齐展开有计划的骚乱。他们到处进行煽动，捣毁和抢劫店铺，放火焚烧工人俱乐部和工人宿舍，并且企图袭击中央政府机关。这些武装匪徒趁着混乱还攻击人民警察和苏军士兵。他们冲进法院，烧毁档案并释放了纳粹杀人犯。当骚乱正在进行时，美国军官竟然在柏林街头指挥暴徒，美国的广播车也对暴徒们进行煽动和发出指示；美国军用飞机散发事先印好的煽动骚乱的传单。不过，这个挑衅事件在二十四小时内就被粉碎了。
    1956年4月22日，美国占领者的一件丑闻又被揭露了。苏联驻柏林部队这一天发现了美国间谍机关在德意志民主共和国境内秘密开凿的一条地下坑道，这条坑道里设有电话偷听站。从柏林美占区内沿着地下坑道架设了几条电线，并且把它连接在苏军使用的电话线上。
        必须结束
    仅仅从以上几件事就足以证明，美英法继续占领西柏林，是打算用它来作为进行冷战的中心，进行间谍活动的中心。特别是西德正在加紧进行原子武装和法西斯化，西柏林就有可能成为波恩政权侵略政策的跳板。这些情况显然是与德国人民希望柏林成为和平城市和最后统一国家的愿望相违背的。对柏林的占领制度应该而且也必须结束了。　（西）
