Collective pig farming has ten great advantages:
　　Rapid pig development　More labor attendance　Fertilizer used centrally　More capital accumulation　Low feeding costs
　　Good experience exchange　More meat for commune members　Hygiene for both people and livestock　Large sales volume　Suppressed speculation
　　(Reported by this newspaper) The practice of the Dalun People's Commune in Taixian County, Jiangsu Province, a well-known pig-producing area, proves that collective pig farming in the commune has ten superiorities. In the two months since its establishment, the commune's pig production has experienced a leap-forward development, with the number of pigs raised increasing by 60%. The entire commune is striving to increase the number of pigs in pens by the end of this year from the current 36,000 to more than 70,000.
　　Prior to the establishment of the Dalun People's Commune, the original twenty-five agricultural cooperatives only raised 3,000 pigs, while commune members raised nearly 20,000 pigs privately. Due to the decentralized individual breeding, a large amount of labor was occupied, reducing the attendance time and energy for collective production; more importantly, it was impossible to operate according to the national planned economy, and the pig market fluctuated from time to time. Moreover, individual pig raising also affected the teaching and implementation of advanced breeding techniques and hygiene and epidemic prevention measures. After communization, the commune demanded the rapid and comprehensive development of industry, agriculture, and sideline production, so that all commune members could become prosperous. Therefore, it was required that all individual pig raising be transformed into collective pig raising by the commune. The Party Committee of the Dalun People's Commune decided to follow the mass line, mobilizing commune members to consciously and voluntarily contribute their pigs to the commune at a discounted price for centralized breeding by the commune. At that time, some people doubted the superiority of collective pig farming, worried that the commune would not raise them well, and worried about the lack of pocket money in the future, the inconvenience of eating pork for weddings and funerals, and the inability to repay debts owed for pig raising. Wealthy households who had been raising pigs for a long time, and had more income from this, were particularly nostalgic for the small-scale production of pig raising, and sought various excuses to oppose collective pig raising. Cadres were also afraid that it would be difficult to manage after collective breeding. In response to the above ideological situation, the Commune Party Committee vigorously publicized the benefits of collective pig raising and launched a debate centered on "Which method is better, collective pig raising or individual pig raising?", "Is public raising necessary?", and "Can public raising be done well?". Specific issues were resolved one by one. For example, on the issue of discounting, those with financial difficulties were paid the full price at once; those with general living conditions were paid half first, and the rest was paid off in installments; wealthy households who did not need the money urgently were paid off regularly, with the longest period not exceeding two years. In this way, everyone was at ease, knowing that the pigs were not entering the commune for nothing. Through presenting the facts and reasoning, the commune members unanimously realized that collective pig raising was better than individual pig raising, and in five days, all 22,000 pigs were contributed to the commune at a discounted price, and they actively helped the commune solve the difficulties brought about by large-scale pig raising, investing more than 1,000 pig pens, more than 2,000 rooms of building materials for repairing pig pens, and various pig raising utensils and more than 7,000 yuan in cash to the commune.
　　From the beginning, the Commune Party Committee strengthened its leadership over this emerging undertaking. From the commune to the team, specialized pig breeding organizations were established at all levels. More than one hundred pig farms (stations) were established throughout the commune. Farmers with good backgrounds, who cared about the collective, loved the commune as their home, and had experience, were selected as breeders. A pig insurance station was established, equipped with ninety-five veterinarians and livestock workers, specializing in guiding the breeding management and hygiene and epidemic prevention work of various pig farms (stations), and helping to train talents in this area. The pig farms (stations) all have feed bases and have grasped the feed reserve work.
　　In the two months since the Dalun People's Commune began collective pig farming, it has demonstrated ten major advantages. First, it changed the slow state of pig production, and the number of pigs raised soared from 22,000 to 36,000, which is the result of the commune's planned breeding, raising, and selling. Second, it increased the labor attendance rate. Third, all fertilizers are used centrally by the commune. Fourth, the large-scale development of collective pig raising increased income and expanded production funds, and the commune's pig raising income is expected to be 500,000 yuan this year. Fifth, after collective pig raising, only more than 4,000 pig pens are needed in total, while in the past, more than 15,000 were needed, and the houses saved are used to store grain. The number of units for burning pig food was reduced from more than 8,000 to more than 100, greatly saving fuel and reducing costs. Sixth, advanced technologies and experiences in breeding management were exchanged in a timely manner, and hygiene and epidemic prevention work was successfully implemented. Seventh, the development of pigs increased the meat consumption of all commune members, which not only improved their lives, but also consolidated public canteens. Eighth, it changed the sanitary conditions of commune members' houses. Ninth, the state's pig purchase volume increased significantly after collective pig raising. In the past month, the commune sold more than 5,000 pigs to the state, which is more than four times more than the number sold to the state by private pig raising each month. Tenth, pigs were raised by the commune, which curbed speculative activities, thus blocking the path of capitalist development in pig raising. (Attached picture)

    集体养猪有十大好处
    猪只发展快　劳动出勤多　肥料集中用　积累资金多　饲养成本低
    经验好交流　社员多吃肉　人畜都卫生　出售数量大　制止了投机
    本报讯　著名生猪产地江苏泰县大埨公社的实践证明，公社养猪有十大优越性。这个社在成立两个月来，生猪生产出现飞跃发展的局面，生猪饲养量上升达60％。全社争取今年年底生猪圈存数从现有的三万六千多头增加到七万多头。
    大埨公社建立前夕，原有二十五个农业社只饲养生猪三千头，社员私人养猪近两万头。由于分散的个体饲养，占用了大量劳动力，减少了集体生产的出勤时间和精力；更重要的是不能按国家计划经济办事，生猪市场时而波动。而且个体养猪还影响到先进饲养技术和卫生防疫措施等方面的传授和贯彻。公社化后，公社要求迅速地全面地发展工业农业和副业生产，使全体社员都富裕。因此要求把个体养猪全部变为公社集体养猪。大埨公社党委会决定走群众路线，发动社员自觉自愿把生猪折价入社，由社集中饲养。当时有一部分群众怀疑集体养猪的优越性，担心公社养不好，并顾虑今后零用钱没有来源，婚丧喜事食用猪肉不便，因养猪欠的债无法归还等。一向养猪多的，这方面收入较多的富裕户，特别留恋小生产的养猪方式，寻求各种借口反对集体养猪。干部也怕集体饲养后难以管理。公社党委针对上述思想情况，大张旗鼓宣传集体养猪的好处，开展了以“集体养猪和个体养猪那种方式好”、“要不要公养”、“公养能不能养好”为中心内容的鸣放辩论。对于一些具体问题，则一一加以解决。如在折价问题上，对经济困难的一次付清全部价款；生活一般的看情况先付一半，其余分期还完；富裕户不急需钱用的定期归清价款，期限最长的也不超过两年。这样大家安心，知道生猪不是白白入社。通过摆事实，说道理，社员一致认识到集体养猪比个体养猪好，在五天中就把两万二千头生猪全部折价入社，并主动帮助公社解决大量养猪所带来的困难，共向社投资一千多间猪舍，两千多间修猪舍的房料，和各项养猪用具以及现金七千多元。
    公社党委一开始就加强对这项新兴事业的领导。从社到队，层层建立生猪饲养专业组织。全社建立一百多个养猪场（站）。挑选成分好、关心集体、爱社如家、有经验的农民当饲养员。一个生猪保险站成立了，配备有九十五名兽医和畜牧员，专门指导各养猪场（站）饲养管理和卫生防疫工作，并帮助培养这方面的人材。养猪场（站）都有饲料基地，并抓住了饲料储备工作。
    大埨公社集体养猪两个月来，体现出十大好处。第一，改变生猪生产缓慢状况，生猪饲养量从两万二千头猛增到三万六千头，这是公社有计划地繁殖、饲养、出售的结果。第二、增加了劳动出勤率。第三、肥料全部由社集中使用。第四、大量发展集体养猪，增加收入，扩大生产资金，全社今年养猪收入预计有五十万元。第五、集体养猪后，一共只需猪舍四千多间，过去却要一万五千多间，节省下来的房屋用来储藏粮食。烧猪食的单位从八千多个缩减为一百多个，大大节省了燃料，降低成本。第六、饲养管理方面的先进技术和经验得到及时交流，卫生防疫工作顺利贯彻。第七、生猪发展，全体社员食肉量增加，既改善生活，又可巩固公共食堂。第八、改变社员住屋的卫生条件。第九、国家生猪收购量在集体养猪后有了显著增加。这个公社在近一个月中卖给国家的猪子有五千多头，比私人养猪时每月出售给国家的多四倍以上。第十、生猪归社饲养，制止了投机活动，这就在养猪方面堵塞了资本主义发展的道路。（附图片）
