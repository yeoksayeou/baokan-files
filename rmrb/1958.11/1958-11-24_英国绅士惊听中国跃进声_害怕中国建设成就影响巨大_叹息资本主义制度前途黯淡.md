    British Gentlemen Shocked by the Sounds of China's Great Leap Forward
    Fearing the Huge Impact of China's Construction Achievements, Lamenting the Dim Future of the Capitalist System

    In the face of the achievements of the Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people, it has become increasingly impossible for Britain and other Western countries to close their eyes and pretend they see nothing. The giant dragon of the East has taken off; the British bourgeois newspapers are being forced to use more and more space to comment on this historically significant great change.

    The surprise and fear of the Great Leap Forward in China is impossible to hide in Britain. Their tone has changed, and more and more people are demanding revisions to their past assessments of China. It is "dangerous to underestimate and ignore" this "unprecedented rate of development" in the Chinese economy! "The figures released by China require us to fundamentally re-evaluate our views on China becoming a great economic power." They are using such words as "extremely fast speed," "almost unbelievable," "miraculous," and "extraordinary achievement by any standard" when commenting on China's economic development.

    On the one hand, the British bourgeois newspapers have to admit that China's construction is a "Great Leap Forward." "No one doubts that this year is an extremely good year for agricultural harvests," "an extremely good year for industrial harvests," and "the scale of industrial development is also peculiar." However, due to the shortsightedness of the bourgeoisie, they simply cannot understand the earth-shattering changes taking place in China, and they believe that the figures we have published are excessively "exaggerated." The "Observer" said in an article on November 9 that "the Chinese government claims that this year's grain harvest will reach 350 million tons; last year's harvest was 185 million tons. It is certain that this is a great exaggeration; it is difficult to imagine that any country under any system could increase its harvest by nearly double in one year." And some newspapers' statements are even more ridiculous. For example, the "Times" said that "an increase of 60% to 90%" is a "crude exaggeration," and its foolish and ignorant reason is that "in the fastest years of grain production development in the Western Hemisphere, the annual output has not reached such a level."

    Of course, from "complete disbelief" to "half-belief and half-doubt," this cannot be said to be a small change. Here, we might as well recall how they viewed China's proposal to "catch up with or surpass Britain in major industrial products within fifteen years." At that time, they considered this a "bold" slogan, but one that was impossible to achieve. "The Economist" magazine said in its June commentary on our fifteen-year catch-up with Britain: "Mao Zedong's slogan 'Catch up with and surpass Britain in fifteen years' may be realized in coal, but not necessarily in steel." The "Daily Telegraph" said in its commentary on our grain increase target: "The goal of reaching 250 million tons of grain by 1962 is overly optimistic." Some people said that China's "technical personnel problem cannot be solved," and some even said: "Can horses grow wings?" They did not know that the east wind was blowing strongly, and the red dragon was following closely in an instant. The facts before them today are something they never dreamed of!

    Britain, shocked, cannot help but tremble for its own future. The most direct reaction of some British people and newspapers to our Great Leap Forward is that the development of our industrial and agricultural production will "threaten" Britain's foreign markets. This is really "inseparable from one's profession." After British Labour Party Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Wilson visited China and returned to Britain, he wrote: After China catches up with Britain, "it means a new trading rival has emerged, as dangerous as Japan, West Germany...". The "Times" even did some calculations for us. It said: China's grain production amounts to more than half a ton per person, so there must be a lot of surplus. Is China now becoming the sole grain supplier in Asia? China's good harvest undoubtedly strengthens its export capacity. "Just from the point of view that there is no place to store so much grain, how much will it dump on the world market?" "China only needs to dump a small portion of wheat to disrupt the current world market."

    What Britain is most afraid of is that in the peaceful competition between the two social systems, capitalism will be completely defeated. First of all, over the past year, China's various constructions have been a Great Leap Forward, while Britain has been a Great Retreat. As an industrial barometer, the production of coal and steel in Britain has not only not increased this year, but has also decreased compared with last year. Steel production in October decreased by 17% compared with the same period last year, and overall industrial production decreased by 4% compared with the same period last year. Britain is worried, not without reason, that it is "about to be pushed to fifth place among the world's industrial countries by China." Secondly, Britain is worried that the torch of China's Great Leap Forward will illuminate the road forward for the vast economically backward countries in Asia and Africa. The "Sunday Times" said in its commentary on our steel production: "China is proving that the West can no longer monopolize industrial technology! The East, regardless of its ideology, can challenge the West and catch up with Western industry at the fastest speed," "and establish a huge national heavy industry." The "Observer" believes that China's victory proves to the vast economically backward countries in Asia and Africa that "the concept of the free world" is "not suitable for developing Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world." Another newspaper said: "Everything that is happening in China" will be considered by "backward countries" as "communism" being a "panacea."

    Worrying that China's Great Leap Forward will dump wheat or machines is somewhat neurotic; worrying that capitalism will be defeated in the peaceful competition between the two systems touches on the essence of the problem. Now, even the leading figures in the bourgeoisie often sigh about the future of capitalism. Churchill said in a recent speech that "our future is not secure." Macmillan said in a recent speech that "the material achievements of communism" are "truly remarkable." "Faced with this challenge from the Communists, we cannot hold our ground in our own country, let alone in neutral countries..." If these words are compared with Churchill's cry forty years ago to "strangle the Soviet Union in its cradle," what a meaningful contrast this is! (Attached picture)

### 英国绅士惊听中国跃进声  害怕中国建设成就影响巨大  叹息资本主义制度前途黯淡

    英国绅士惊听中国跃进声
    害怕中国建设成就影响巨大  叹息资本主义制度前途黯淡
    在中国人民大跃进的成就面前，英国以及其他西方国家想闭上眼睛，假装什么也看不见，已经愈来愈不可能了。东方的巨龙已腾空而起；英国的资产阶级报纸，被迫着用越来越多的篇幅，来评论这一具有历史意义的伟大变革。
    英国对中国大跃进的惊讶与惶恐，是无法掩饰的。他们的腔调变了，越来越多的人要求修改过去他们对于中国的估价。“低估和忽视”中国经济的这种“史无前例的发展速度是危险的！”“中国公布的这些数字，要求我们对中国发展成为经济上的伟大国家的看法，作出根本的重新估价。”他们在评论中国的经济发展时，用的都是这样一些字眼：“极快的速度”，“几乎使人难以相信的”，“奇迹般的”，“用任何的标准来看，这都是异乎寻常的成就”。
    英国的资产阶级报纸一方面不得不承认中国的建设是个“大跃进”。“没有任何人怀疑今年是农业收成极好的一年”，“工业收成极好的一年”，“工业发展的规模也是奇特的”。但是，由于资产阶级的短视眼光，他们根本无法理解在中国所发生的翻天覆地的变化，它们又认为我们所公布的数字，是在过分地“夸大”了。“观察家报”在它的11月9日的一篇文章中的说法就是这种典型。它说“中国政府宣称，今年的谷物收成将达三亿五千万吨；去年的收成为一亿八千五百万吨。可以肯定，这是大大地夸大了；很难设想到会有任何制度下的任何国家竟能在一年内使收成增加了将近一倍。”而有些报纸的说法更可笑。像“泰晤士报”说：“增产60％到90％”是“粗暴地夸大了”，其愚蠢无知的理由是“在西半球谷物生产发展的最快年代，每年的产量都没有达到这样的水平。”
    固然，从“根本不信”到“半信半疑”，这不能不说多少有些转变。在这里，我们不妨回忆一下中国提出“十五年内在主要工业产品方面赶上或超过英国”时，他们是怎样看的。当时他们认为这是一个“大胆的”口号，不过这是不可能实现的。“经济学家”杂志在它今年6月份评论我们十五年赶英国时说道：“毛泽东的口号‘十五年内赶上和超过英国’，在煤炭方面可能实现，在钢铁方面就不一定了”。“每日电讯报”在评论我们的谷物增产的指标时则说：“到1962年要达到两亿五千万吨谷物的目标，则是过分乐观了”。有的人说中国的“技术人员问题无法解决”，甚至有人说：“难道马还能长上翅膀？”他们那知东风猛吹，红色巨龙在一转瞬之间就跟踪而至。今天摆在他们面前的事实是他们作梦也没有想到过的！
    英国在震惊之余，却不免为自己的前途而胆颤心寒。英国某些人士和报纸，对于我国大跃进的最直觉的反映，是认为我国工农业生产的发展，将“威胁”到英国的国外市场。这真是“三句不离本行”。英国工党在野内阁财政大臣威尔逊访问中国回英之后写道：中国在赶上英国之后，“它意味着一个新的贸易敌手出现了，就像日本、西德……一样危险”。“泰晤士报”甚至还为我们算了一笔账。它说：中国的谷物生产每人合到半吨多了，一定有很多结余。中国现在是成为亚洲唯一的谷物供应者呢？中国的丰收，无疑增强了它的出口能力。“仅只从那末多的粮食没有地方存放这一点来说，它要向世界市场抛售多少呢？”“中国只要抛售一小部分小麦，就可以打乱目前世界市场”。
    英国最恐慌的是：在两个社会制度的和平竞赛中，资本主义将被彻底打败。首先，一年来，中国的各项建设是大跃进，英国却是大跃退。作为工业寒暑表的煤钢生产，英国今年不仅没有增加，而且还比去年缩减了。10月份的钢产量比去年同期减产17％，整个的工业生产，比去年同期下降了4％。英国不无理由地焦虑：它“即将被中国推到世界工业国中的第五位”。其次，英国忧虑中国这一大跃进的火炬，将会照亮亚非广大经济落后国家前进的道路。“星期日泰晤士报”在评论我们的钢铁生产时说：“中国正在证明：西方再也不能够垄断工业技术了！东方，不管它的思想意识形态如何，能够向西方挑战，并以最快的速度赶过西方工业”，“而建立起巨大的民族重工业”。“观察家报”认为，中国的胜利，向亚非广大经济落后国家证明：“自由世界的观念”“不适合于发展中的亚洲非洲和世界其他地方”。另一家报纸说：“中国正在发生的一切，会被落后国家”认为，“共产主义”是“百病皆治的灵药”。
    担心中国的大跃进会大倾销小麦或机器，这未免有些神经过敏；忧虑在两个制度的和平竞赛中资本主义将被击败，这倒是触及了问题的本质。现在，即使是资产阶级中的领袖人物，对资本主义的前途也常常发生叹息。丘吉尔在最近的一次讲话中就说：“我们的前途并不可靠”。麦克米伦在最近的一次讲话中则说：“共产主义的物质成就”，“实在是卓越的”。“面对共产党这种挑战，我们不能够在我们的国家保住我们的阵地，更不要说在中立国家了……”如果把这些言谈，同丘吉尔在四十年以前叫嚷的要把苏联“扼死在襁褓之内”加以比较，那末这是个多么有意义的对照！（附图片）
