Karamay mining area's three thousand six hundred-plus young and middle-aged housewives have marched onto the oil industry front, participating in various industrial production and service industries such as drilling, oil extraction, and refining. After these housewives joined the oil front, they alleviated the labor shortage in the mining area, made great achievements in production posts, and set an example for women to participate in the oil industry.

From August this year to the present, all young and middle-aged family members in the Karamay mining area have participated in work, forming "March 8th" production organizations throughout the mining area. They not only organized production organizations such as clothing factories, food processing factories, and various service industries, but also participated in industrial production such as drilling, oil extraction, and refining. These women overcame numerous difficulties in their work with perseverance. In just over a month, they mastered the general techniques of industrial production such as drilling, oil extraction, refining, driving tractors, and building houses, shattering the view held by many in the past that the oil industry was a heavy industry that women simply could not handle.

When the women of the "March 8th" drilling team first arrived at the well team to study, the sun in the Gobi Desert made them dizzy and their lips cracked. Climbing up the high well tower several feet high made their hearts race and their legs tremble, but they still insisted on learning. If they couldn't remember the names of the tools, they would recite them in their sleep and while eating. As a result, in just over a month, they were able to master small drilling rigs and independently drill wells. To date, they have drilled fifteen shallow oil wells, and every well has produced oil. When the "March 8th" oil extraction team was first established, some male comrades even ridiculed them. These young women composed the following poem to express their determination: "We are not afraid of the scorching sun, nor do we care about the tight wind and sand. Since ancient times, Gui Ying has been famous, and the girls are even stronger than Gui Ying." With such determination, they overcame the difficulties of managing oil wells and repairing oil wells. In two months, they took over fifty oil wells, exceeding the number of oil wells managed by each male oil extraction team member, undertaking one-fifth of Karamay's crude oil production tasks, and established eleven satellite factories in the team for oil refining, charcoal black production, and natural gas recovery. A refinery that can process more than 20,000 tons of crude oil a year is now entirely managed and operated by women.

After housewives went to the production front, these employees' family members, who were originally trapped in household chores all day long, were industrialized. This has made Karamay a mining area where every household has no idle people, everyone has work, eating is collective, children are in nurseries, sewing is mechanized, and organizational actions are militarized.

    石油女兵
    辛芬
    克拉玛依矿区的三千六百多名青壮年家庭妇女走向石油工业战线，参加了钻井、采油、炼油、运输等各项工业生产和服务行业工作。这批家庭妇女走上石油战线后，缓和了矿区劳动力的紧张，在生产岗位上作出很大成绩，而且给妇女参加石油工业作出了榜样。
    从今年8月到现在克拉玛依矿区全部青壮年家属都参加了工作。组成了遍及矿区的“三八”生产组织。她们不仅组织了被服厂、食品加工厂和各种服务性行业的生产组织，而且参加了钻井、采油和炼油等工业生产。这些妇女以坚毅的意志战胜了工作上的重重困难，在一个多月内，就掌握了钻井、采油、炼油、驾驶拖拉机、建筑房屋等工业生产的一般技术。打破了过去许多人认为石油工业是重工业，妇女根本担任不了的看法。
    “三八”钻井队的妇女初到井队学习时，戈壁上的太阳晒得她们眼前发黑，嘴唇裂缝，一攀上几丈高的井塔心跳腿抖，但她们仍然坚持学习，工具名称记不下，吃饭睡觉时也在嘴里念。结果在一个多月后，她们就能掌握小钻机独立钻井了。到目前她们已钻成十五口浅油井，口口井都钻出了油。“三八”采油队刚成立的时候，有的男同志还嘲笑她们。这些青年妇女编了这样一首诗歌来表示她们的决心：那怕赤日当头照，那管风沙吹得紧，自古桂英威名扬，姑娘更比桂英强。她们就以这样的决心克服了管理油井和修理油井的困难，在两个月内接管了五十口油井，超过了男子采油队每人所管油井的数量，担负了克拉玛依五分之一的原油生产任务，并在队上办起了十一个炼油、烧炭黑、回收天然气等卫星工厂。一座一年可以处理两万多吨原油的炼油厂，现在已全部由妇女管理和操作。
    家庭妇女走向生产战线以后，使这些原来整天陷入家庭琐事的职工家属已工人化。使克拉玛依成为户户无闲人，人人有工作，吃饭集体化，小孩托儿化、缝纫机械化、组织行动军事化的矿区。（附图片）
