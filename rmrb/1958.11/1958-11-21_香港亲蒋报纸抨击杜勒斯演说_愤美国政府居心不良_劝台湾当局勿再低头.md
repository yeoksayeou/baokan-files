Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 20th. Hong Kong's pro-Chiang newspaper "Kung Sheung Daily News" published an editorial today, accusing Dulles' speech on the 18th of intensifying the creation of "two Chinas." The newspaper hoped that "the Taipei authorities, in light of Dulles' speech, would be alert and strive for self-reliance," because "kowtowing diplomacy will always be betrayed."

The editorial stated that Dulles' expression of wanting to "find ways for both sides to declare not to rely on force" reveals that its political aim "in a single phrase, is a disguised 'two Chinas'." It said, "Let us frankly point out Dulles' intention: as long as the Chinese Communists do not force the United States to withdraw its armed forces from the Taiwan area, this is his greatest 'political goal' and his final 'effort'."

The editorial believed that Dulles' attempt to use the Warsaw talks to achieve its aggressive aims is doomed to failure. It said that the United States' aim "failed in the past during the Geneva talks, and it is failing now in the Warsaw talks. No matter how you 'continue your efforts,' you will still fail."

The editorial pointed out that Dulles' policy towards China is based on creating "two Chinas," and since both mainland China and Taiwan oppose "two Chinas," the United States' China policy and Far East policy are both failures.

The pro-Chiang newspaper, in commenting on the US's so-called "no use of force" trick, said that the Chiang-Dulles joint communique is "absolutely opposed" by pro-Chiang individuals in Taiwan. The editorial angrily accused the United States of treating the Taiwan authorities "as a dependency," "allowing itself to dominate them," and verbally saying that it "respects" the Taiwan authorities, but in reality, it is only making Taiwan "a US base."

The editorial also expressed dissatisfaction with US interference in internal affairs. It said: "Even if there is a so-called political issue in the Taiwan Strait, it should be handled by the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) itself, without the need for the United States to overstep its bounds." It said that there is a danger of the Taiwan authorities being "betrayed" and that the current actions of the United States are causing "deep suspicions," and it questioned the Taiwan authorities, "How will you gentlemen explain yourselves!"

Another pro-Chiang newspaper in Hong Kong, "Tze Jan Daily News," published an article today titled "Advise Mr. Dulles Not to Sell Out Friends for Glory Again," stating that "Dulles' speech on the 18th has too many disappointing aspects for us." It said that Dulles is forcing the Taiwan authorities to publicly announce "renouncing the use of force" only to exchange it for the Chinese Communists also making a "renunciation of promises," but the Chinese Communists will never pay attention, and the United States can only "act like a petty person in vain."

The Hong Kong Kuomintang's official newspaper, "Hong Kong Times," said in its editorial today that the so-called "Taiwan's status is yet to be decided internationally" and the "two Chinas" theory recently proposed by "Western politicians" are absurd. The editorial said that Western politicians' "'two Chinas' trick is to use the blood and tears of the Chinese people to irrigate and cultivate the flowers and fruits of Western countries' security and prosperity, and take 'Taiwan's status is yet to be decided internationally' as the theoretical basis..." The editorial expressed its strong opposition to the above two statements of Western politicians, saying: "The Chinese people, in order to strive for freedom and survival, would rather be shattered jade than preserved tile, and will not care about any external pressure."

### 香港亲蒋报纸抨击杜勒斯演说  愤美国政府居心不良  劝台湾当局勿再低头

    香港亲蒋报纸抨击杜勒斯演说
    愤美国政府居心不良  劝台湾当局勿再低头
    新华社香港20日电　香港亲蒋报纸“工商日报”今天发表社论，指责杜勒斯18日的演说在加紧制造“两个中国”。这家报纸希望“台北当局鉴于杜勒斯这个演说，有所警惕自奋”，因为“低头外交，永远是被出卖的”。
    这篇社论说，杜勒斯表示要“设法使双方宣布不依靠武力”，其政治目的“一语道破，就是变相的‘两个中国’”。它说，“让我们率直地指出杜勒斯的心事，只要中共不迫使美国撤退台湾地区的武装力量，这就是他最大的‘政治目的’，也就是他最后的‘努力’”。
    社论认为杜勒斯想利用华沙谈判来达到它的侵略目的是注定要失败的。它说，美国这种目的“过去在日内瓦谈判中失败了，现在在华沙谈判中也失败了，只管你‘继续努力’，仍然要失败下去的”。
    社论指出，杜勒斯的对华政策是以制造“两个中国”做基础的，而中国大陆和台湾都反对“两个中国”，因此，美国的对华政策和远东政策都是失败的。
    这家亲蒋报纸在评论美国搞所谓“不使用武力”花招的时候说，蒋杜会谈公报是台湾亲蒋人士“所绝对反对的”。社论愤懑地指责美国把台湾当局“视为附庸”，一任己意支配”，并且口头上说“尊重”台湾当局，实际上却只是使台湾“成为美国的基地”。
    社论还表示不满美国干涉内政。它说：“即使台湾海峡有所谓政治问题，也应该由中华民国（指蒋介石集团）自己去处理，用不着美国越俎代庖”。它在提出台湾当局有被“出卖”的危险后说，目前美国的所作所为“疑虑已深”，它质问台湾当局“诸公将何以自解啊！”
    香港另一家亲蒋报纸“自然日报”今天以“忠告杜勒斯先生幸勿再卖友求荣”为题发表文章说，18日“杜勒斯的演说，使我们失望的地方太多”。它说，杜勒斯硬逼台湾当局公开宣布“放弃使用武力”，只是为了想换取中共也来一个“放弃诺言而已”，可是中共绝不理睬，美国只好“枉作小人”。
    香港国民党机关报“香港时报”今天的社论说，最近“西方政客”提出的所谓“台湾地位尚待国际决定”和“两个中国”之说，是荒诞不经的。社论说，西方政客的“‘两个中国’的诡计，是借中国人的血泪以灌溉培育西方国家安全繁荣之花果，而以‘台湾地位尚待国际决定’为理论根据……。”社论对西方政客的上述两种说法表示极力反对的态度说：“中国人民为着争取自由生存，宁为玉碎，不为瓦存，任何外来压力，皆不屑顾。”
