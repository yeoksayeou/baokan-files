    (I) China Fir: It is one of China's unique tree species, and generally matures in just over twenty years. It grows almost everywhere south of the Yangtze River basin and in southern Shaanxi in the northwest. The material is of excellent quality and does not warp or crack easily. It is a good material for factory and mine construction, shipbuilding, utility poles, bridges, farm tools, etc. As early as seven or eight hundred years ago, people in the mountainous areas of Hunan and Guizhou were engaged in the management of China fir forests. At present, there are more than 100 million mu of China fir forests in the country, and the amount of felling accounts for one-quarter of the total timber felling in the country.
    According to current statistics, seventy-seven plots of high-yield China fir forests have appeared in forty-three communes and state-owned forest farms in eighteen counties in six provinces and regions: Hunan, Guizhou, Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Guangxi. The shortening of China fir's maturation period from twenty years to ten years or even eight years is of great significance to the rapid improvement of the lives of people in mountainous areas, especially to meet the needs of national construction. According to the preliminary plans of eighteen provinces and cities, during the period of the Second Five-Year Plan, a total of more than 190 million mu of fast-growing, high-yield forests, mainly China fir, will be planted, requiring ten years to mature. The total storage volume of these high-yield forests will reach 10 billion to 17 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 1.6 to 2.8 times the current national forest storage volume.
    (II) Oil Tea: It is a perennial woody oil crop, cultivated in provinces throughout the Yangtze River basin, from Guanyun County in Jiangsu Province in the north to Hainan Island in the south. Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces are the main producing areas. Newly planted oil tea trees bear fruit in five years, and hundred-year-old oil tea trees can still bear fruit. This year, the national oil production is expected to be 5 million dan, an increase of more than 66% over the highest pre-war annual output. According to preliminary calculations in the oil tea high-yield plan, tea oil production will reach more than 36 million dan by 1962, which can solve about one-third to one-half of the annual edible oil needed by about 400 million people in eleven southern provinces (regions) (calculated at 24 jin per person per year).
    (III) Moso Bamboo: Also known as Nan bamboo, it can be felled and utilized five to seven years after afforestation, and is one of the fastest-growing plants in the world. Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and other southern provinces are the main producing areas of Moso bamboo. Southern Henan, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu provinces, as well as northern Guangdong and eastern Yunnan, also have distributions. According to recent statistics, the national Moso bamboo forest area is about 19 million mu. In recent years, Moso bamboo has been in short supply. From 1956 to 1957, the supply of Moso bamboo only accounted for 50%-60% of the demand. At present, party and government leaders in various producing areas are vigorously grasping Moso bamboo production. (Attached picture)

### 杉木·油茶·毛竹

    杉木·油茶·毛竹
    （一）杉木：是我国特有树种之一，一般二十多年即可成材。长江流域以南各省以及西北的陕南，几乎到处皆有生长。材质优良，不易翘裂，是厂矿建筑以及造船、电杆、桥梁、农具等上好用材。早在七、八百年前，湖南、贵州山区人民就从事经营杉木林。目前全国共有杉林一亿多亩，采伐量占全国木材总采伐量的四分之一。
    据目前统计，湖南、贵州、福建、浙江、广东、广西等六省区十八个县四十三个社和国营林场，出现了杉木丰产林七十七片。杉木从二十年成材缩短到十年甚至八年成材，对迅速提高山区人民生活，特别是满足国家建设用材有重大意义。据十八省市初步规划，在第二个五年计划期间，造以杉木为主的快速丰产林共一亿九千多万亩，要求十年成材。这些丰产林总蓄积量将达一百至一百七十亿立米，相当目前全国森林蓄积量的一点六至二点八倍。
    （二）油茶：是多年生的木本油料作物，长江流域各省北起江苏灌云县，南至海南岛都有栽培。以湖南、江西、广西、浙江、福建等省为主要产区。新植的油茶，五年就结果，百年的油茶尚能结果。今年全国预计产油量五百万担，比战前最高年产量增加66％以上。据油茶丰产规划初步计算，1962年茶油产量将达三千六百万担以上，可以解决南方十一省（区）大约四亿人口全年所需食油（每人每年按二十四斤计）的三分之一到一半左右。
    （三）毛竹：又叫楠竹，造林五年至七年即可采伐利用，是世界上生长最快的植物之一。南方的浙、湘、赣、闽等省为毛竹主要产区。豫、陕、苏等省南部，粤北、滇东都有分布。据最近统计，全国毛竹林面积约一千九百万亩。几年来毛竹一直供不应求，1956年至1957年毛竹供应量只占需要量的50％—60％。目前各产区的党政领导正大抓毛竹生产。（附图片）
