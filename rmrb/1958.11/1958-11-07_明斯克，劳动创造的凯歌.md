    Minsk, in the impression of Europeans, is a very old city with a history of about nine hundred years. However, the new Minsk did not exist fifteen years ago. During the Great Patriotic War, Minsk was occupied by the invaders for three years and suffered serious damage.
    80% of Minsk's housing was destroyed, meaning only one out of every five houses remained. Not a single factory was left in the city. Minsk suffered losses worth about 4.5 billion rubles.
    But the most serious and painful loss was people. Before the war, Minsk had a population of 300,000, but on July 3, 1944, when Minsk was liberated, there were only 20,000 people left.
    Now, look at Minsk in 1958!
    The scale of Minsk's construction is astonishingly large. Post-war investment in basic construction has reached 6.8 billion rubles, of which about 2 billion has been used for residential construction.
    Minsk, a small and unknown provincial city during the Tsarist era, is now not only in the Soviet Union but has also become one of the world's centers for manufacturing tractors, automobiles, and heavy machine tools.
    This spring, the Minsk Tractor Factory produced its 100,000th tractor. Thirty countries around the world recognize machines bearing the factory's trademark.
    The assembly line of the Minsk Automobile Factory has already produced tens of thousands of dump trucks. The factory won the "Grand Prix" - a high award at the Brussels World Expo - for manufacturing the four-ton, 450-horsepower "MA3-530" dump truck.
    The "Friendship" brand television sets from the Minsk Electrical Equipment Factory also won a gold medal at the Expo.
    These are just three factories listed. There are dozens more like these in Minsk. It can be called a network of automated factories. Every month, hundreds of machine tools are produced here. The clock factory produces 200,000 watches a year, and the wool textile mill produces 45,000 meters of woolen cloth a day. In addition, there are many, many more such factories, and this is just counting the first few on the factory list...
    The scale of urban construction after the war is also astonishing. The city has laid 224 kilometers of water pipes, 60 kilometers of tram lines, and 23 kilometers of trolleybus lines. It has established 135 primary and secondary schools and secondary technical schools, 130 kindergartens and nurseries, 18 hospitals, 20 theaters and cinemas, and five museums.
    The revitalized Minsk is a triumphant song of victory created by the collective labor of the people.
    Minsk has countless ties with China. Convoys of Minsk tractors and automobiles are being transported eastward. One-fifth of the machine tools produced by the Kirov Heavy Machine Tool Factory are supplied to our Chinese brothers. The people of Minsk have visited Chinese factories many times, and representatives from Chinese factories are often guests in Minsk.
    The friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is as high as the mountains and as deep as the water. This fraternal friendship will last forever. (Image attached)

    明斯克，劳动创造的凯歌
    波·乌斯金诺夫
    明斯克，在欧洲人的印象里，它是个很古老的城市，约有九百多年的历史。但是，新的明斯克在十五年以前还不曾存在。在伟大的卫国战争年代里，明斯克曾被侵略者占领了三年，遭受了严重的损失。
    明斯克的住宅80％遭到了破坏，就是说每五所房子仅剩下了一所。城市里没有留下一座工厂。明斯克遭受的损失，约值四十五亿卢布。
    但是，最严重沉痛的损失还是人。战前，明斯克有三十万人口，而在1944年7月3日，明斯克解放时，只有两万人。
    且看1958年的明斯克吧！
    明斯克的建设规模是惊人巨大的。战后基本建设的投资已达六十八亿卢布，其中用于住宅建筑方面的约为二十亿。
    沙皇时代默默无闻的小省城明斯克，如今不但是苏联的，而且已成为世界上制造拖拉机、汽车、重型机床的中心地之一。
    今年春季，明斯克拖拉机厂出产了十万台拖拉机。世界上有三十个国家认识到带有这个工厂商标的机器。
    明斯克汽车工厂的传送带已经送走了上万辆自卸卡车。由于制造了四吨重、四百五十马力的“MA3—530”型自卸卡车，这个厂荣获了
  “戈兰—普里”——布鲁赛尔世界博览会的高级奖。
    明斯克电气器材工厂的“友好”牌电视机也获得博览会的金质奖。
    这仅是列举了三个工厂。这样的工厂在明斯克还有几十个。可以称之为自动化工厂网。这里每个月出产几百台机床，钟表工厂每年生产二十万支手表，毛织品联合工厂一昼夜生产四万五千公尺毛布。此外还有许多许多这类的工厂，这只不过是数了工厂名单中开头的几个……
    战后城市建设的规模也是惊人的。城市里敷设了二百二十四公里长的自来水管，六十公里长的电车线和二十三公里长的无轨电车线，建立了一百三十五所中小学和中等技术专科学校，一百三十所幼儿园和托儿所，十八个病院，二十家剧场、电影院，五座博物馆。
    复兴的明斯克是人们集体劳动创造的胜利凯歌。
    明斯克同中国有千丝万缕的联系。明斯克的拖拉机、汽车一队接着一队运往东方。基洛夫重型车床工厂生产的车床有五分之一是供给中国兄弟的。明斯克人曾多次到中国的工场里做客，中国工厂的代表也常常是明斯克的客人。
    中苏两国人民的友谊，山高水深。这种兄弟般的友谊将万古长存。（附图片）
