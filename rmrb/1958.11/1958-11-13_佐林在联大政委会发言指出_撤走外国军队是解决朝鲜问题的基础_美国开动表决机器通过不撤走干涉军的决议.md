Xinhua News Agency, 12th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee concluded its discussion on the Korean issue yesterday and, under the manipulation of the United States, passed the proposal of the United States, Britain, and thirteen other Western countries.

This proposal, basically cobbled together by the countries that participated in the Korean War, is almost a carbon copy of the “resolutions” on the Korean issue passed by previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. It obstructs the genuine peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, demanding the unification of Korea through so-called elections held under the supervision of the United Nations.

Soviet delegation leader Zorin pointed out once again during the vote that this proposal reflects the United States' unwillingness to withdraw its troops from South Korea. He said that according to this proposal, the withdrawal of foreign troops and the unification of Korea must be realized according to the conditions set by the countries that participated in the Korean War, which is a unilateral decision and cannot be used as the basis for solving this problem.

Zorin pointed out more than once during the Political Committee's discussion of this issue that the United States and South Korea are still fantasizing about using force to unify Korea, retaining South Korea as a military base for attacking the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Zorin warned that those who cannot conquer the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by force should not expect to gain anything with a piece of resolution, especially since this resolution was voted on by the delegations of the member states of those military blocs.

Zorin pointed out that the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea has created new conditions for an early resolution of the Korean issue. As long as the United States emulates this noble example, a stable situation can be established in this region of the world, and an important step can be taken towards the unification of Korea.

Zorin read out the main contents of the note from the Government of the People's Republic of China to the governments of all countries participating in the war of aggression against Korea under the banner of the United Nations.

Zorin emphasized that the basis for solving the Korean issue can only be the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea, followed by peaceful negotiations between North and South Korea. The Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves.

Zorin rebuked the Western countries' representatives for their slander against the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He said that this slander was spread in this committee in the absence of representatives from these two countries. He said that once the People's Republic of China has restored its seat in the United Nations, the People's China will come here to respond to this slander.

During the vote, fifty-two votes supported the proposal of the United States and other countries, nine votes from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries opposed it, and many Asian and African countries including Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Republic, Yemen, as well as European countries Finland and Yugoslavia abstained. Iraq, Lebanon, and Libya voted in favor of the Western proposal last year.

This debate and vote on the Korean issue in the Political Committee once again proves the United States' repeated tactic of delaying the resolution of the Korean issue year after year. On the other hand, the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea and the proposals of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries were welcomed by the representatives of the vast number of Asian and African countries in the United Nations.

Many representatives criticized the US proposal as unhelpful to the resolution of the Korean issue; they advocated direct negotiations between the two sides in Korea to seek a fundamental solution to the Korean issue. When discussing the issue of supervision of elections in Korea, the Indian representative pointed out that the United Nations was one of the belligerents in the past, and he believed that elections do not necessarily have to be conducted under the supervision of the United Nations. The Ceylonese representative also pointed out that foreign troops in South Korea are the main obstacle to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. He urged the United States and other countries with troops stationed in Korea not to miss the good opportunity of the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea to resolve the Korean issue. The Afghan representative criticized the US proposal for not taking any practical steps to promote negotiations between the two sides in Korea to break the deadlock in resolving the Korean issue. Even the Canadian representative, who followed the United States, had to admit that forcibly implementing unilateral decisions could not solve the problem.

The Political Committee also passed a proposal to include the Korean issue on the agenda of next year's United Nations General Assembly session.

### 佐林在联大政委会发言指出  撤走外国军队是解决朝鲜问题的基础  美国开动表决机器通过不撤走干涉军的决议

    佐林在联大政委会发言指出
    撤走外国军队是解决朝鲜问题的基础
    美国开动表决机器通过不撤走干涉军的决议
    新华社12日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会昨天结束了关于朝鲜问题的讨论，并且在美国的操纵下通过了美英等西方十三国的提案。
    这个基本上由侵朝国家纠合提出的提案，几乎是过去几届联合国大会通过的关于朝鲜问题的“决议”的翻版，它阻挠朝鲜问题的真正和平解决，要求通过所谓在联合国监督下举行的选举实现朝鲜的统一。
    苏联代表团团长佐林在投票时再一次指出，这个提案反映了美国不愿从南朝鲜撤出自己的军队。他说，按照这个提案，撤出外国军队以及朝鲜的统一，都要根据侵朝国家所制定的条件来实现，这是单方面的决定，不能作为解决这个问题的基础。
    佐林在政治委员会讨论这一问题的过程中不只一次指出，美国和南朝鲜仍然幻想用武力统一朝鲜，保留南朝鲜作为进攻中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的军事基地。佐林警告说，那些不能用武力征服中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人，休想用一纸决议来得到什么东西，何况这个决议又是由那些军事集团的成员国的代表团投票通过的。
    佐林指出，中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜，给朝鲜问题的早日解决创造了新的条件，只要美国效法这个崇高的榜样，世界这一地区就能够建立安定的局面，就能够在统一朝鲜问题上迈进重要的一步。
    佐林宣读了中华人民共和国政府给打着联合国旗帜参加侵朝战争的各国政府照会的主要内容。
    佐林强调说，解决朝鲜问题的基础只能是一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜，然后南北朝鲜之间举行和平谈判。朝鲜问题应当由朝鲜人民自己来解决。
    佐林斥责了西方国家代表对于中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的诬蔑。他说，这种诬蔑是在没有这两个国家的代表参加的情况下在这个委员会里散布的。他说，一旦中华人民共和国恢复了它在联合国的席位，人民中国将到这里来对这种诬蔑作出答复。
    在表决时支持美国等国提案的有五十二票，苏联和其他社会主义国家的九票反对，许多亚非国家包括阿富汗、缅甸、柬埔寨、锡兰、加纳、印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、利比亚、摩洛哥、尼泊尔、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、阿拉伯联合共和国、也门以及欧洲的芬兰、南斯拉夫的代表投票时都弃权。伊拉克、黎巴嫩和利比亚去年是投票支持西方提案的。
    这次政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的辩论和表决再次证明了美国实行年复一年地拖延解决朝鲜问题的故技。但另一方面，中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜以及苏联和其它社会主义国家的建议，受到联合国中广大亚非国家代表的欢迎。
    许多代表指责了美国提案无助于朝鲜问题的解决；他们主张朝鲜双方进行直接谈判，以求得朝鲜问题的根本解决。印度代表在谈到在朝鲜举行选举的监督问题时指出，联合国过去是交战双方之一，他认为选举并不一定要在联合国监督下进行。锡兰代表也指出，外国军队在南朝鲜境内是和平解决朝鲜问题的主要障碍。他要求美国和在朝鲜驻有军队的其它国家不要错过中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜这个好机会，来解决朝鲜问题。阿富汗代表指责美国提案没有采取任何实际步骤促进朝鲜双方谈判以打破解决朝鲜问题的僵局。甚至追随美国的加拿大代表也不得不承认强制执行单方面的决定不能使问题得到解决。
    政治委员会还通过把朝鲜问题列入明年联合国大会会议的议程的提案。
