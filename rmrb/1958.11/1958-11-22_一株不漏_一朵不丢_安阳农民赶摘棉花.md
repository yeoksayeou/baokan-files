Anyang Farmers Rush to Pick Cotton

(Our dispatch) The Anyang County of Henan Province, the largest cotton-planting county, recently organized an army of 210,000 cotton pickers to launch a crash harvest of cotton. By November 11, they had successfully picked over 200 million jin of unginned cotton, accounting for 75% of the estimated total yield.

This year, the county has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton. The county has a total of 730,000 mu of cotton fields, with an estimated yield of 1,095,000 dan of ginned cotton, averaging 150 jin per mu, an increase of 2.3 times compared to last year. Due to the high yield and concentrated boll opening, coupled with the fact that since the autumn harvest, the main leading forces at all levels and a large amount of labor have been invested in steel production and deep plowing, the county had only picked 4 million jin of unginned cotton by mid-October. Therefore, for a period of time, the fields of Anyang County were a vast expanse of white, a silver sea.

In order to timely recover all the fruitful results, the Anyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China took a series of measures to put the cotton picking work on the agenda of the entire Party. On October 23, a four-level cadre meeting was held in the county. Through airing views, debates, and criticisms, the spontaneous theory of "cotton picking does not need leadership" and the erroneous thinking of "no need to rush cotton picking, it will be harvested sooner or later" among cadres were criticized. It was proposed that the entire Party and all the people should be mobilized to launch a crash harvest of cotton. On November 7, in response to the problems in the movement, a mobilization order was issued again to all people's communes, government offices, and schools via telephone, calling for every household to lock their doors and everyone to go to the fields to launch a crash harvest. Now the cotton picking movement is still continuing in full swing.

    一株不漏　一朵不丢  安阳农民赶摘棉花
    本报讯　河南省植棉最多的安阳县最近组织二十一万摘棉大军突击抢收棉花，到11月11日已胜利摘回籽棉二亿多斤，占预计总产量的75％。
    这县今年获得了棉花空前大丰收。全县棉花共七十三万亩，预计产皮棉一百零九万五千担，平均每亩收一百五十斤，比去年增产二点三倍。由于产量高而且吐絮集中，再加秋收以来，各级主要领导力量和大量劳动力投入钢铁生产和深翻土地，全县到10月中旬才摘回籽棉四百万斤。所以安阳县的田野上，曾有一个时期是白茫茫一片银海。
    为了适时全部收回丰硕果实，中共安阳县委采取一系列措施，把摘棉工作提到了全党的议程上来。10月23日召开全县四级干部会，通过鸣放辩论，批判了干部中“摘棉花不用领导”的自流论，和“摘棉花不用慌，早晚总要收回来”的错误思想，提出全党全民动员突击抢收棉花。11月7日又针对运动中的问题，用电话向各人民公社、机关、学校再次发布了户户落锁，人人下地，突击收花的动员令。现在摘棉运动仍如火如荼继续在突击开展中。
