    "Small-Scale Indigenous Groups" Form a Production Line: "Four Indigenizations" Display Great Power
    Jincheng Accelerates Rural Construction, Vigorously Pursuing Indigenous Mechanization, Indigenous Electrification, Indigenous Railroad Construction, Indigenous Lathe Production

    According to a report from the Shanxi Daily, on the foundation of the great leap forward in steel production, Jincheng County is launching a mass, self-reliant "Four Indigenizations" movement throughout the county, focusing on indigenous mechanization, indigenous railroad construction, indigenous electrification, and indigenous lathe production. This aims to replace manual labor, massively save labor power, and promote an even greater leap forward in industry and agriculture both now and in the coming year. At the same time, it will establish a complete industrial system, accelerate the process of rural industrialization and agricultural mechanization, and create favorable conditions for moving towards communism.

    After Jincheng County launched a mass movement to smelt steel and iron using indigenous methods in September, labor power became quite strained. The county needs to consistently maintain a daily output of over one thousand tons of pig iron, requiring more than fifty thousand laborers and over ten thousand iron-wheeled vehicles for transportation every day. To shift steel production from a crash campaign to normal high output, while also ensuring that the agricultural production front does not lack labor power, the county party committee put forward the slogan "using both hands and brains" long ago, to fundamentally solve the difficulty of insufficient labor power. Various regions responded to this call from the county party committee and carried out many technological revolutions in iron smelting production to improve production efficiency and ensure the quantity and quality of steel production. The workers of Jincheng Cooperative Hardware Factory fought hard for six days and nights, using waste materials to make a ten-horsepower ore crusher, which processes thirty-six tons of ore a day, enough to replace the labor of more than one hundred people. In order to liberate the coal and ore mining production process from backward production methods and heavy physical labor, the Dayang Steel Plant used hand drills to make holes for blasting instead of manual labor using pickaxes to dig coal and ore. Each person now averages ten tons of coal and one ton of ore per day, increasing mining efficiency by 2 to 50 times compared to manual mining. The plant is building a seven-li-long indigenous railroad to transport coal and ore instead of iron-wheeled vehicles, which can save one thousand laborers and one thousand animal-drawn vehicles every day. The workers of Jincheng Cooperative Machinery Plant, in order to allow the "mechanical marshal" to take command and ensure the effectiveness of the power machinery installed in industry and agriculture, so that parts can be repaired on the spot immediately when they break down, successfully created a three-foot-long indigenous lathe. Its structure is very simple, and its function surpasses that of foreign-made lathes, opening up a new path for rural machinery repair. At the same time, they also produced four large-scale simple lathes, equipping themselves.

    The workers of the Jincheng Power Plant, based on the dispersed characteristics of the countryside, modified 1.5 horsepower motors into generators, solving the problem of electricity use in rural factories.

    The Jincheng County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that this "Four Indigenizations" technological revolution can fundamentally replace backward manual operations, thoroughly liberate labor power, and ensure a leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The combination of large enterprises supplying equipment and the "Four Indigenizations" on the foundation of high indigenous steel output has made rural mechanization and electrification stand on two legs instead of one, greatly accelerating the process of rural mechanization and electrification.

    “小土群”一条龙  四土化显神通
    晋城加速农村建设，大搞土机械化、土电机化、土铁路化、土车床化
    据山西日报消息　在钢铁生产大跃进的基础上，晋城在全县范围内掀起群众性的、自力更生的土机械化、土铁路化、土电机化、土车床化“四土化”运动，从而代替手工劳动，大量的节省劳动力，促进当前及明年工农业的更大跃进。同时建立完整的工业体系，加速农村工业化和农业机械化的进程，为迈向共产主义创造有利条件。
    晋城县在9月间开展群众性的土法炼钢炼铁以后，劳动力显得相当紧张。全县要经常保持日产千吨以上生铁，每天需要五万余名劳动力和一万多辆铁轮车运输。为了使钢铁生产从突击转向正常的高产，同时保证农业生产战线上不缺少劳动力，县委早就提出了“手脑并用”的口号，从根本上解决劳动力不足的困难。各地响应了县委这一号召，在炼铁生产中进行了许多技术革命，来提高生产效率，保证钢铁生产的数量和质量。晋城合作五金厂的职工苦战六昼夜，用废料制成一台十马力的碎矿机，一天加工三十六吨矿石，足可以代替一百多个人的劳动。大阳钢铁厂为把采煤采矿的生产过程从落后的生产方法与繁重的体力劳动中解放出来，用手摇钻打眼放炮代替了人力用钁头刨煤、刨矿，每人每天平均采到十吨煤、一吨矿石，比人工采矿效率提高了二至五十倍；该厂正在兴建一条七华里长的土铁路运煤运矿，代替铁轮车拉运，一天即可节省一千个劳力、一千个牲口车辆。晋城合作机械厂的职工们，为使机械元帅升帐，保证发挥工农业上安装的动力机械效能，做到零件坏了马上就能就地修配，创造成功了三尺长的土车床，构造非常简单，作用超过了洋造车床，为农村机械修配开辟了一条新道路。同时，还生产了四部大型简易车床，装备了自己。
    晋城发电厂的职工根据农村分散的特点，将一点五马力的电动机改装为发电机。解决农村工厂用电问题。
    中共晋城县委认为，这“四土”技术革命，可以从根本上代替落后的手工操作，彻底解放劳动力，保证了工农业生产跃进。大企业供应设备和在土钢铁高产基础上的“四土化”相结合，便使农村机械化、电气化由一条腿成了两条腿，使农村机械化电气化的进程大大加快。
