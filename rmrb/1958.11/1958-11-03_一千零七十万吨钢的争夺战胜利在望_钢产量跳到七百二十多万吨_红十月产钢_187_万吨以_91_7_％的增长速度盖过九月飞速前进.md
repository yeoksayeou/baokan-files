Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. According to statistics from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, from January to the end of October this year, the country has produced more than 7.2 million tons of steel. October, known as the "key month" for the steel front, achieved a double harvest of steel. The national steel production in October reached 1,877,000 tons, an increase of 91.7% compared with September, and the iron production reached 8,716,000 tons, an increase of 457% compared with September. In this heroic October, production success stories flew like snowflakes across the country. The high-yield steel week from the 15th to the 21st once raised the national steel production to a new level; and in the last ten days following the high-yield week, this high-yield level not only stabilized but also increased significantly. On the 30th, the national steel production was more than 160,000 tons, and on the 31st, it was followed by more than 230,000 tons.

The steel harvest in October is the fruitful result of the mass movement of the whole party and the whole people in vigorously promoting industry with steel as the key link. The production practice in this month further eloquently proves that on the steel industry front, whether it is a large, medium, small, "indigenous" or "foreign" enterprise, vigorously launching mass movements is an important method to ensure the high-speed development of steel production. Those arguments that attempt to belittle the mass movement of industry are completely untenable in the face of facts. In this month, the "small indigenous groups" showed great power in steelmaking. The steel produced by the vast masses using various small, "indigenous" steelmaking furnaces increased more than five times compared with September. Two months ago, the steel production in Henan and Shandong provinces was still very low. Excluding the output of key steel enterprises, the average daily steel production in Shanxi and Sichuan provinces reached one thousand to several thousand tons in October, and there were seven ten-thousand-ton steel counties and cities, a number of thousand-ton counties and cities, and thousand-ton people's communes. The steel production in Fujian, Yunnan, Guizhou and other provinces also increased rapidly. The "small indigenous groups" developed ironmaking even faster. A month ago, there were only more than 70 counties and cities with an annual output of 1,000 tons of pig iron, but now, according to incomplete statistics, it has developed to more than 160. The common experience of these provinces, regions, counties, and cities in obtaining high steel production is that the masses are mobilized deeply, thoroughly, and widely.

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry believes that these high-yield areas now need to summarize and improve the experience of "small indigenous groups" in steelmaking and ironmaking in a timely manner, for example: identify excellent furnace types; select areas with coal and iron ore resources to establish furnace groups for steelmaking and ironmaking, and then establish small iron mines, small coal kilns, and small steel rolling mills nearby, and combine them with the transportation of "small indigenous groups" to gradually develop into small, indigenous and foreign-combined steel joint bases, improve technology, tools, equipment, and improve labor efficiency; organize fixed professional teams for mining, transportation, and smelting, and so on. After summarizing, adjusting, and improving, achieve fixed furnaces (excellent furnace types), fixed points (bases), fixed groups (furnace groups), fixed personnel (personnel), and fixed leadership, and take the steelmaking and ironmaking experience of the "small indigenous groups" a big step forward. Now, Henan, Shandong, Hunan and other provinces have taken some measures and are adjusting and improving the steelmaking and ironmaking methods of the "small indigenous groups."

The steel production of key steel enterprises across the country also continued to increase in October with the development of the mass movement in enterprises. Hundreds of thousands of employees are working hard to break through the technical barriers of "indigenous ironmaking and steelmaking" and "normal production of new converters," and have achieved many new achievements. In order to support these key enterprises in completing the state's steel production plan, the main iron-producing provinces and regions are now facing two urgent tasks: speeding up the collection and transportation of pig iron and greatly improving the quality of pig iron. The pig iron produced in various provinces is extremely scattered. The pig iron scattered next to the indigenous blast furnaces cannot play a role. Only by concentrating them, transporting them to key steel plants, and refining them into steel and rolling them into steel, can the abundant iron truly play a role in production and construction. Judging from the recent situation, the quality of pig iron is still a problem that deserves great attention. Various localities need to take various measures to ensure the quality and quantity of pig iron production advance together.

    一千零七十万吨钢的争夺战胜利在望
    钢产量跳到七百二十多万吨
    红十月产钢187万吨以91.7％的增长速度盖过九月飞速前进
    当前的迫切任务：把“小土群”逐渐发展为小型的土洋结合的钢铁联合基地；加紧集运生铁，提高生铁质量，支援重点钢铁企业
    据新华社2日讯　据冶金工业部的统计，从今年1月到10月底止，全国已产钢七百二十多万吨，被称为钢铁战线“关键月”的10月，获得了钢铁双丰收。全国钢产量10月份达到一百八十七万七千吨，比9月份增加了91.7％，铁产量达到八百七十一万六千吨，比9月份增加了457％。在这英雄的10月，各地生产捷报如雪片纷飞。15日到21日的钢铁高产周，曾经把全国钢铁产量提高到了一个新的水平；而紧接着高产周的最后十天，这个高产水平不仅稳定下来了，而且又增长了许多。30日全国产钢十六万多吨，31日紧接着又产钢二十三万多吨。
    10月份的钢铁丰收，是全党全民大搞以钢为纲的工业群众运动带来的硕果。这个月的生产实践进一步雄辩地证明：在钢铁工业战线上，不论是大、中、小型、“土”的或“洋”的企业，大搞群众运动是保证钢铁生产高速度发展的重要方法。那些企图贬低工业群众运动的种种论调，在事实面前是根本站不住脚的。这个月，“小土群”炼钢大显威力，广大群众用各种小的、“土”的炼钢炉炼出的钢，比9月份激增了五倍多；两个月前产钢都还非常少的河南、山东两省和除去重点钢铁企业产量的山西、四川两省，10月份每天平均钢产量都达到了一千到数千吨，而且出现过七个钢的万吨县、市，一批千吨县、市和千吨人民公社；福建、云南、贵州等省钢产量增长得也很迅速。“小土群”炼铁发展得更快，一个月前，全国涌现的生铁千吨县、市，还只有七十多个，现在，据不完全统计，已经发展到一百六十多个了。这些省、区、县、市，获得钢铁丰产的共同经验是群众发动得深、透、广。
    冶金工业部认为，这些丰产地区，现在需要及时总结和提高“小土群”炼钢炼铁的经验，例如：鉴定优良的炉型；选择有煤矿、铁矿资源的地区，建立炼钢炼铁的炉群，再在附近建立小铁矿、小煤窑、小轧钢厂等，并和“小土群”的交通运输相结合，逐渐发展成为小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地，改良技术、工具、设备，提高劳动效率；组织固定的采、运、冶炼专业队伍等等。经过总结、调整、提高，作到定炉（优良炉型）、定点（基地）、定组（炉群）、定员（人员）、定领导，把“小土群”的炼钢炼铁经验再向前推进一大步。现在，河南、山东、湖南等省都已经采取了一些措施，正在调整和提高“小土群”的炼钢炼铁方法。
    全国重点钢铁企业10月份的钢铁生产，随着企业群众运动的开展也续有增长。数十万职工正在猛力冲闯“土铁炼钢”和“新转炉正常生产”的技术难关，并已取得了许多新成就。为了支援这些重点企业完成国家钢产量计划，各主要产铁省、区面前，现在摆着两项刻不容缓的急迫任务，即：加紧集运生铁，大力提高生铁质量。各省生产的生铁极其分散，分散在土高炉旁的生铁是不能发挥作用的，只有把它们集中起来，运进重点炼钢厂，炼成钢、轧成钢材，丰产的铁才能确确实实对生产、建设起到作用。从最近情况看，生铁质量还是一个值得十分注意的问题，各地需要采取各种措施，才能保证生铁生产的质量和数量一同跃进。
