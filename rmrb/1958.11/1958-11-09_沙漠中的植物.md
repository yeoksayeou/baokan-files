Little Knowledge

    Before humans fought the desert, many plants had already entered the desert area. For thousands of years, they have been engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the desert. There is no precise data on how many species of these plants there are. This year, the Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural and Animal Sciences surveyed 192 square kilometers of desert in the Junggar Basin and discovered as many as 97 plant species. These plants have the common characteristics of deep root systems and small (or no) leaves, allowing them to survive in a dry climate with annual rainfall of less than 200 mm and evaporation of up to 2,000 mm. They have multiple functions such as resisting wind, fixing sand, and improving soil, which are of great benefit to humans. Now, let's introduce two or three of them:

    The Hercules of the Desert

    The Saxaul is a perennial shrub of the Chenopodiaceae family, distributed in the deserts of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other regions. It is the Hercules of desert plants. Given appropriate temperature and humidity, its seeds can germinate in two or three hours.

    Once grown, the saxaul has a strong ability to resist sand. Its roots are often several to more than ten times longer than its stem. Years of drifting sand cover it, but it always grows higher than the sand, fixing the sand. It can live for seventy or eighty years. The saxaul has no leaves; the multi-segmented fleshy twigs can replace the leaves to perform photosynthesis. In the hot and dry summer, the flowered buds are dormant until the seeds grow and mature in late autumn.

    Saxaul is a wood with strong firepower. After it forms a forest, each mu can harvest three to five cubic meters of firewood and charcoal per year.

    The Pioneer of Sand Fixation

    Calligonum, also known as "Knotweed," is a unique desert plant in Xinjiang, with no less than five or six species. It is a shrub, some creeping, some erect. This plant prefers to grow in newly formed desert areas. Once loose sand and soil have been transformed into a firm and compact state over the years, its growth begins to deteriorate. Therefore, it is the pioneer of sand fixation.

    Calligonum also has very strong vitality. It can grow to three or four meters high in four or five years. It also has a high ability to germinate and renew, and propagation by cuttings can also survive.

    Grass with High Nutritional Value

    Many desert plants are good feed for livestock. However, the most nutritious is the Alhagi.

    Alhagi is a perennial herbaceous leguminous plant with deep roots. Although it grows low, it has a great sand-fixing effect. No matter how high the sand dunes accumulate, it can grow as high. It can often be found on very high sand dunes. Its branches and leaves are all emerald green, and the thorns become hard and prickly after they grow. Alhagi is a very good feed. One hundred catties of dry Alhagi is equivalent to eighty catties of corn. Because the thorns are hard, it needs to be crushed when feeding other livestock besides camels.

### 沙漠中的植物

    沙漠中的植物
    在人类没有和沙漠作战以前，有许多植物就打进了沙漠地带。千万年来，它们和沙漠进行着你死我活的斗争。这些植物究竟有多少种类，现在还没有确切的资料。今年，新疆农牧科学研究所曾经在准噶尔盆地调查了一百九十二平方公里的沙漠，发现的植物种类多达九十七种。这些植物的共同特点是根系深、叶面小（或无叶），可以在年降雨不到二百公厘、蒸发量却达二千公厘的干燥的气候下生存。它有抗风、固沙和改良土壤等多种作用，对于人类有很大益处。现择其二三介绍一下：
    沙漠中的大力士
    梭梭是一种多年生的藜科灌木，它分布在新疆、内蒙古等地区的沙漠之中。它是沙漠植物中的大力士，遇有适当的温度和湿度，它的种籽两三个小时就能发芽。
    梭梭一经长成，它有顽强的抗沙能力。它的根经常比茎还要长几倍到十多倍。积年累月的流沙盖住它，但它总要长得比沙高，固定住沙。它可以活上七八十年。梭梭没有叶子，多节的肉质嫩枝可以代替叶子行使光合作用。在炎热干旱的夏季，开过的花儿处于休眠状态，直到深秋种子才长大成熟。
    梭梭是火力很强的木材，成林后每年每亩可收获三立方公尺到五立方公尺薪炭。
    固沙的先锋
    拐枣是新疆特有的沙漠植物，不下五、六种。它是一种灌木，有的匍匐，有的直立。这种植物的茎枝弯弯曲曲。它最喜欢生长在新形成的沙漠地带。等到积年累月，松散的沙土已被改造得紧结，它的生长状态就开始变坏，因此，它是固沙的先锋。
    拐枣生命力也非常旺盛，四、五年后就可以生长到三、四公尺高。它的萌芽更新的能力也很高，插条繁殖也能够成活。
    营养价值很高的草
    沙漠中的植物有许多都是家畜很好的饲料。但是养分最大的还要算骆驼刺。
    骆驼刺是一种多年宿根草本豆科植物，它虽然生长得低矮，固沙作用很大，沙丘积多高，它就能长多高，常常在很高的沙丘上也能找见它，它的枝叶全呈碧绿色，刺长大后硬的棘手。骆驼刺是很好的饲料，一百斤干骆驼刺可顶上八十斤玉米。因为刺硬，除骆驼外，喂其他家畜时需要磨碎。
