Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch: On the eve of the October Revolution Day, our reporter interviewed relevant personnel from the central industrial departments. With gratitude, they spoke to the reporter about the fraternal assistance of Soviet experts in this year's Great Leap Forward in China's industrial production and construction.

What is recorded here are just a few of the thousands of examples, yet they are already sufficient to fully demonstrate the lofty internationalist spirit and excellent qualities shown by Soviet experts in contributing their exquisite technology to China's Great Leap Forward.

In order to achieve the great task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year, people across the country launched a vigorous mass movement to "seize steel from time." Soviet experts helping China build large-scale iron and steel enterprises also joined this intense battle. At the construction site of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, Soviet experts, led by the 63-year-old expert team leader Badurov, worked day and night with Chinese builders on site to guide the construction, braving the scorching heat and continuous rain in the south, to ensure the early tapping of iron from Blast Furnace No. 1. Furnace-building expert Frezhkov often personally demonstrated actions for the workers. On one occasion, he helped build the lining of the molten iron tank. At that time, it was the hot summer in the south, the outdoor temperature reached 38 degrees Celsius, and the tank was airtight and even hotter. Frezhkov was sweating profusely, and his clothes were completely soaked. The workers advised him to rest, but he insisted on building for a long time. Expert Kovor, who helped install the weighing car for Blast Furnace No. 1, worked all day and night with the builders during the intense installation process, without sleeping for two nights. He said: "I am very moved by the Chinese comrades' spirit of racing against time. I also want to break the rules and race against time." Finally, the 70-ton weighing car was installed and adjusted ahead of schedule. At the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex, which is under intense construction, whether the first-phase drainage and water supply project can be accelerated is one of the keys to whether the large blast furnace can produce iron ahead of schedule in 1959. Some people at the construction site once thought that the drainage and water supply project was difficult and proposed postponing the construction period. After water conservancy expert Haminkov arrived at the construction site, he studied it with the builders and decided to take measures to continue construction in the severe winter and accelerate the water supply and drainage project.

Adapting to the Great Leap Forward in steel production, experts have also made many contributions to the leap forward in machinery, coal, water conservancy, electricity, geology, and transportation. Some experts enthusiastically discussed and formulated leap forward plans with Chinese staff; some experts put forward suggestions for building more, faster, better, and more economically in accordance with the spirit of China's general line of socialist construction. The Southwest Optical Glass Factory was originally designed by a foreign country. Because the country urgently needed optical glass, it was decided to redesign it domestically. With the active help of three experts, the entire design work of the factory was completed in only one month. Dudaev, the leader of the expert group of the First Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, also proposed the suggestion of taking materials locally and competing with the river for land when helping to design the railway to the Jingtieshan Mining Area, in view of China's characteristics. In a section of the line about 30 kilometers long, the 14 bridges were reduced to 8, and the three tunnels with a total length of 850 meters were also reduced. It is estimated that this suggestion can save 3.5 million yuan, and it will also greatly speed up the progress of the project. Kurganov, an expert of the Ministry of Coal Industry, also showed a bold and innovative style in helping Fengfeng Coal Mine build a new coal mine. The geological conditions of the newly built Tongshun No. 2 well of Fengfeng Coal Mine are very complicated, and many people therefore advocated using the "freezing method" for construction. After Kurganov studied the relevant data in detail and visited the drilling workers, considering that China has few freezing equipment, the use of this method would not only be costly but also delay the construction period, so he proposed a new construction method, which resulted in accelerating the construction progress and reducing the cost by half compared with the "freezing method." Bovolvoy, the leader of the expert group of the Beijing Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, inspected the construction site of the Ming Tombs Reservoir and proposed reducing the thickness of the inclined panel of the dam section, saving a lot of earthwork. Bovolvoy's suggestion has now been applied to other similar projects.

After learning about China's policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises, the experts of various departments not only helped the production and construction of China's large enterprises in their daily work, but also were willing to help solve some technical problems of medium and small-sized factories and mines. Sonin, an equipment installation expert from the Ministry of Construction Engineering, was originally responsible for installing large converters and open-hearth furnaces. When he was helping in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei and other places, and saw hundreds of small blast furnaces and small converters, he further realized the great significance of China's simultaneous development of large, medium, and small enterprises and the combination of "indigenous" and "foreign" methods in developing the steel industry. Therefore, he helped these areas solve some technical problems in small smelting equipment. Now Sonin not only helps install large equipment, but also helps install small equipment and helps solve problems in production. People who work with him affectionately call him a "jack-of-all-trades". When geological expert Ivanov went to the Northeast to help, he also took the initiative to propose surveying small mines and designing small mine mining regulations.

The experts' spirit of selfless labor is very touching. In order to cooperate with the Great Leap Forward in China's industrial production and construction, many experts proposed "come whenever we are needed." They often worked tirelessly until late at night, and even gave up their holidays. The experts of Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant moved their offices into the workshop. Tekchinko, an mechanical installation expert, was injured in the Soviet Patriotic War. He often drilled into the foundation pit more than ten meters deep and climbed to the high altitude of more than ten meters to check the construction.

    以国际主义精神献出精湛的技术
    大跃进中苏联专家立大功
    新华社3日讯　十月革命节前夕，本社记者访问了中央各工业部门有关工作人员，他们共同怀着感激的心情，向记者畅谈了苏联专家们今年在我国工业生产、建设大跃进中情同手足的援助。
    这里记述的虽然只是千百件事例中的几件，然而却已经可以充分地看出苏联专家们为把自己精湛的技术贡献给我国大跃进事业，表现出来的崇高的国际主义精神和优秀的品质。
    为了实现今年产钢一千零七十万吨的伟大任务，全国人民掀起了轰轰烈烈的“向时间夺钢铁”的群众运动。帮助我国建设大型钢铁企业的苏联专家，也投入了这场紧张的战斗。在武钢建设工地上，以六十三岁高龄的专家组长巴杜洛夫为首的苏联专家们，为保证一号高炉提前出铁，和我国建设者一道，不避南方的酷暑霪雨，日夜在现场指导施工。筑炉专家弗列日可夫经常亲自为工人作示范动作。有一次，他帮助砌铁水罐的内衬，当时正值南方炎夏，室外温度达摄氏三十八度，罐内不透空气，更加闷热，弗列日可夫汗流如雨，衣服全湿透了。工人们劝他休息，他仍坚持砌了很长时间。帮助安装一号高炉秤量车的专家柯沃尔，在紧张的安装过程中，和建设者们一起整天工作，两夜没有睡觉，他说：“中国同志分秒必争的精神，使我十分感动，我也要打破常规，分秒必争。”终于把七十吨重的秤量车提前安装、调整完毕。正在紧张施工的包头钢铁联合企业，第一期排供水工程能否加快是大型高炉能否在1959年提前出铁的关键之一。工地上曾有人认为供排水工程困难多，提出推迟工期。水工专家哈敏可夫到工地后，和建设者们一起经过研究，决定采取措施，在严寒的冬季继续施工，加快了供水、排水工程。
    适应钢铁生产的大跃进，专家们为机械、煤炭、水利、电力、地质、交通运输等工作的跃进，也作出了许多贡献。有些专家热情地和我国工作人员一起讨论、制订跃进计划；有些专家根据我国社会主义建设总路线的精神，提出了多快好省地进行建设的建议。西南光学玻璃厂本来是由国外设计的，因为国家对光学玻璃需要急迫，决定改由国内设计。在三位专家的积极帮助下，只用一个月就完成了该厂的全部设计工作。铁道部第一设计院专家组长杜达也夫在帮助设计通往镜铁山矿区的铁路时，针对我国特点，提出就地取材，与河争地的建议，在大约三十公里的一段线路中，就把十四座桥减少到八座，还减少了共长八百五十公尺的三个隧道。估计这项建议可以节省三百五十万元，而且还大大加快了工程进度。煤炭工业部专家库尔干诺夫，在帮助峰峰煤矿新建煤井时，也表现了敢想、敢干的独创风格。峰峰煤矿新建通顺二号井，地质情况十分复杂，许多人因此主张用“冻结法”施工。库尔干诺夫详细研究了有关资料并访问了钻探工人后，考虑到我国冻结设备少，采用这种方法施工不仅成本高，而且还会拖延工期，就提出一种新的施工方法，结果使施工进度加快，成本比“冻结法”还降低了一半。水利电力部北京勘测设计院专家组长波洛沃依查勘了十三陵水库工地后，对大坝断面提出减少斜垟厚度的建议，节省了大量土方。波洛沃依的这个建议，现在也已应用到其他类似的工程上去了。
    各部门专家们了解到我国大、中、小型企业同时并举的方针后，在日常工作中不仅帮助我国大型企业的生产、建设，而且也乐意帮助解决中、小型厂矿企业的一些技术问题。建筑工程部的设备安装专家索宁，本来是负责安装大型转炉、平炉的。当他在上海、浙江、江西、湖北等地帮助工作，看到成百的小高炉、小转炉时，他进一步认识到我国发展钢铁工业大、中、小型企业同时并举和“土”、“洋”结合的巨大意义，于是，他帮助这些地区解决了一些小型冶炼设备中的技术问题。现在索宁不仅帮助安装大型设备，而且还帮助安装小型设备，帮助解决生产中的问题。和他一起工作的人都亲昵地称他“多面手”。地质专家伊万诺夫到东北地区帮助工作时，也主动提出勘察小矿山，设计小矿山开采规程。
    专家们忘我劳动的精神是十分感人的，为了配合我国工业生产和建设的大跃进，许多专家提出“什么时候需要我们，什么时候来”，他们往往孜孜不倦地工作到深夜，甚至放弃假日的休息。洛阳矿山机器厂的专家们，把自己的办公室搬进了车间，机械安装专家特克钦柯的腿在苏联卫国战争中受过伤，他还经常钻进十多公尺深的基础坑里和攀登十多公尺高的高空去检查施工情况。
