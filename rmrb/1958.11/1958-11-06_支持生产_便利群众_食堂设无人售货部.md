Supporting Production, Facilitating the Masses
    Canteens Establish Unmanned Sales Departments

    In order to support production and facilitate the masses, the Cuijiaqiao Store in Anyang, Henan, has universally established unmanned sales departments in the public canteens of Cuijiaqiao Township.

    According to statistics from 103 canteen unmanned sales departments, the total sales amounted to 12,560 yuan in half a month, and the payment matched the goods exactly, without any discrepancy. Taking the unmanned sales department of the Anyangtun Canteen, with sales of 540 yuan in ten days, as an example, it can save 430 laborers' time for going back and forth to buy goods in a day; the whole township saved more than 9,000 laborers' time in half a month. Commune member An Fuxing happily said: "A cigarette after a meal is like a living god, saving six li of walking, and not costing much money. Production enthusiasm is high, and the drive breaks through the sky."

    支持生产　便利群众
    食堂设无人售货部
    为了支持生产，便利群众，河南安阳崔家桥商店在崔家桥乡的公共食堂里普遍建立了无人售货部。
    据一百零三个食堂的无人售货部统计，半个月来共售货金额达一万二千五百六十元，货款相符，不差分毫。以安洋屯食堂无人售货部十天销货金额五百四十元计算，可节省四百三十个劳力一天买货来回的时间；全乡在半个月内共节省了九千多个劳力一天的时间。社员安福兴愉快地说：“饭后一根烟，好比活神仙，少走六里路，也不多花钱，生产热情高，干劲冲破天。”
