    Teaching Living Marxism
    Preliminary Experiences of Peking University Philosophy Department Moving to the Countryside to Lecture
    Wang Zisong
    The majority of teachers and students, over 300 people, of the Peking University Philosophy Department went to the countryside on August 25th to participate in production labor at the Huangcun People's Commune in Daxing District, Beijing, while simultaneously conducting teaching and scientific research activities. Over the past two months, through participation in regular agricultural labor such as deep plowing and autumn harvesting, the people's commune movement, technical revolution, cultural revolution, and various practical tasks such as commune production management, as well as the adoption of various teaching forms such as investigation and research, summarizing experience, studying documents, airing views and debates, criticism and self-criticism, ideological summaries, and listening to reports, the four aspects of participating in labor production, reforming teaching, scientific research, and transforming ideology have been organically combined. Everyone feels that they have gained a lot, has a more concrete understanding of the Party Central Committee's policy of combining education with productive labor, and recognizes that learning theory through participating in labor and practical work is the correct direction for the development of the Philosophy Department. Therefore, they are full of confidence and ready to continue their efforts on this basis to carry out the teaching reform of the Philosophy Department to the end, and strive to establish a communist university's philosophy department.
    We have the following three preliminary experiences.
  Participating in Productive Labor and Practical Work is the Basis for Reforming
  Teaching, Scientific Research, and Ideological Transformation
    First, participating in productive labor and practical work is the basis for reforming teaching, conducting scientific research, and transforming ideology. We stipulate that we participate in field labor every morning; in the afternoon, we conduct teaching activities, such as holding discussion meetings to study documents and listen to reports. However, when agricultural work is intense, classes are appropriately suspended to work day and night with the peasants; at night, we generally participate in various activities of the peasants. In addition to labor, we participate in various practical tasks, such as eliminating illiteracy, running primary schools, agricultural middle schools, red and expert schools, and red and expert universities, helping peasants learn philosophy and politics, carrying out various recreational activities, and working with peasants to reform agricultural tools, research agricultural technology, establish fertilizer plants and sugar refineries, and helping peasants run canteens and nurseries. Some students also serve as secretaries to the brigade leaders and deputy leaders of the teams. When the people's commune was established and various political movements were launched in the countryside, all teachers and students were propagandists. We have achieved that each person participates in at least one practical task.
    Facts have proven that participating in labor and practical work is the greatest education for intellectuals who are divorced from reality. Some people originally despised manual labor, thinking that peasants did "stupid work." But after participating in labor, they realized that the most stupid was themselves. Even using the simplest spade and hoe required humbly learning from the peasants; otherwise, they would become a laughing stock. An old professor said: "After going to the countryside, I realized that the people who really labor do not get to enjoy, while we who enjoy a lot do not labor." They began to examine their past bourgeois individualism. Students actively participated in labor, while also constantly carrying out ideological struggles. A student wrote in his diary after participating in deep plowing: "Although I used great effort, I could not keep up with the peasants. I thought to myself: why not just plow a little shallower, lower the quality, and catch up, so as not to be embarrassed by always falling behind? But thinking of the Party Central Committee's instructions on deep plowing, I gritted my teeth and tried to catch up behind the peasants. Although I was covered in sweat, I felt very happy." Through these ideological struggles, many people's feelings toward labor and working people gradually began to change.
    Everyone established deep friendship with the peasants in labor, and also participated in various practical tasks, gaining a relatively in-depth understanding of the situation in the countryside. Each class conducted investigations and research, analyzed the ideological dynamics of various classes of peasants, and studied the various contradictions in the countryside. Many people realized that only by learning in practical work can it be vivid and profound. A third-year student always thought that going to the countryside could not be considered learning before going to the countryside. After going to the countryside, he participated in the propaganda work for establishing the people's commune. The peasants raised many questions to him, forcing him to repeatedly go back to find materials, study documents, and learn. Finally, he said: "Now I truly have a more concrete understanding of the superiority of the people's commune. In the past, when I was in school, I thought I had fully understood it after memorizing a few abstract points. Who knew that it could not withstand a peasant's question? Now, this kind of learning can only learn real and vivid Marxism, which can never be learned in school."
  Teaching Content Should Center on Political Movements,
    Teaching Objectives Should Be to Transform the Objective and Subjective Worlds
    Second, the teaching content should center on current political movements, and the teaching objective is to transform the objective world and the subjective world. We will study the basic viewpoints of the three basic theoretical courses of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, socialist and communist ideological education, and political economy during this year in the countryside. Before going to the countryside, we had arranged a teaching plan for the main content of these three courses. After going to the countryside, we immediately discovered that such a subjectively prescribed plan could not be realized. Learning in the countryside can only be carried out with the current political movement in the countryside as the guiding principle. Not long after we went to the countryside, we encountered the vigorous movement to establish people's communes in the countryside, so we seized the opportunity to study the possibility, necessity, and superiority of establishing people's communes. While propagating, everyone conducted investigations and research, and also asked the Party branch secretaries of the township and village to give us reports, explaining the history of cooperation in the township and the various internal contradictions before the establishment of the commune, thereby recognizing that the establishment of the commune was an internal and inevitable trend. Recently, the commune has implemented the supply system and carried out communist education, so we have combined this with studying issues such as distribution and accumulation, the rational adjustment and organization of labor. After the commune implemented the supply system, the students' thinking was greatly shaken, and many students began to realize that to pass the communist stage, they must continuously revolutionize and consciously revolutionize. We are preparing to start learning about communist education, starting with learning about criticizing bourgeois right from the peasants' implementation of the supply system. Some students once proposed to open these three courses separately. Learn according to their respective systems, and some students also advocated a "dual-track system," that is, taking the movement as the guiding principle while also learning systematically. At the ideological summary at the end of September, students were allowed to air their views and debate on this issue. Finally, everyone realized that this opinion of requiring systematic learning was the old dogmatic learning method of "starting from the outline instead of starting from reality," which could only circle around a few conceptual nouns at most. The current learning method is truly in line with the principle of "practice-theory-practice" and is a true method of learning theory. Learning according to the current development of actual movements has infinitely rich content, which can include all the main content of the original three courses, and its own development is also systematic.
    Some people once conducted investigations and interviews with the purpose of solving theoretical problems and writing theoretical articles. The results obtained in this way are often superficial and even have errors in position and viewpoint. We emphasize that the purpose of learning must be to serve practice. It is both to transform the objective world and to transform the subjective world, and these two are dialectically unified. The second-year students who participated in labor in Kangzhuang launched a debate on three issues during the vigorous technical revolution: (1) What to do? Some people wanted to engage in some "profound" technical reforms for the purpose of their own scientific research; the debate concluded that they should obey the current needs of rural production and first engage in fertilizers, etc. (2) How to do it? Some people wanted to buy a lot of foreign instruments and equipment from the city to do it; the debate concluded that they should focus on "local" methods and try to use rural raw materials and equipment. (3) Rely on whom? Some people thought that only a few people could do it behind closed doors; the debate concluded that they should rely on the masses, especially working together with local peasants, and pay attention to cultivating rural technical cadres. Through such debates, the work of technical revolution can be carried out smoothly, and everyone's position, viewpoint, and method can be improved.
  The Main Teaching Methods are Aring Views and Debates and
  Self-Education by the Masses
    Third, the teaching method should focus on airing views and debates, and on the masses educating themselves. The teaching methods we adopt are diverse: whether learning in regular practical work or learning in central political movements, the general Party branch formulates a learning plan and stipulates the goals and requirements for this stage; students conduct some relevant investigations and research, while studying documents and airing views; from the problems raised by airing views, select those that reflect students' thinking as the focus for debate (some problems are discussed with the peasants or participate in the peasants' debates), and repeatedly read classic works and Party policy documents during the debate; the cadres of the commune and village or other comrades are also invited to give relevant reports during the learning process; finally, according to the results of everyone's debate, the general Party branch or political instructor will give a summary report.
    Some students once asked teachers to lecture more, believing that this was the only way to learn theory. After debate, this view was negated, and it was confirmed that mass airing of views and debates should be the main teaching method. The peasants in a village where fourth-year students lived often went to the city to do petty business before cooperation, and some had served as puppet soldiers before liberation. The cadres also had some shortcomings in their work. Some students said: "This kind of village is not typical enough, this kind of peasant is not a real peasant, there is nothing to learn here." After several debates, they still insisted on this opinion. In the end, the masses themselves conducted in-depth investigations and research, and only then did they discover that the peasants often suffered oppression from capitalists in the city when they went to the city to do business, and that they temporarily registered as local puppet soldiers before liberation in order to avoid being drafted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, so the peasants were still working people after all; the cadres' shortcomings were the relationship between nine fingers and one finger, and the poor peasants in the countryside believed that the cadres' advantages of diligence and responsibility were the main ones, only the landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants kept clamoring about the cadres' shortcomings. In this way, the masses themselves clarified their class position and solved the problem. Facts have proven that using the masses' own rich and colorful experiences to make summaries is a successful lecture; otherwise, it will appear empty. Therefore, teaching work must follow the mass line.
    Does this mean that there is no need for reading and the guidance of teachers? No. The biggest difficulty students feel is that they face a large amount of factual material and find it difficult to raise it to rational knowledge. At this time, teaching groups with teachers participating should designate some documents to help students rise from practical materials to theoretical understanding. In this regard, the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, Party policy documents and newspapers, and Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's "On Communist Society" have all played a huge role. We oppose reading for the sake of reading, but we also resolutely oppose the tendency of a few students to despise books, because only under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism theory can we make correct summaries and understandings of practical work, and can we carry out teaching and scientific research.
    The entire teaching is fully arranged and led by the Party's general branch (at the department level) and branch (at the class level), but teachers still have their important role. The teaching and research office and the teaching group become the general staff of the general branch and branch in leading teaching. They can specifically plan learning steps, propose documents, and guide theoretical clues during discussions. Teachers can also give some guidance reports or summary reports on relevant theoretical issues. We emphasize "the able are teachers": not only can teachers lecture, but students (collectively or individually) can lecture as long as they have summarized experience in a certain aspect. The summary lecture given by the Party branch secretary of the second grade was well received. More importantly, we must invite advanced figures among the peasants and rural work cadres to give us lessons. Teachers and students all said after listening to these reports, "This is living Marxism."

    活的马克思主义的教学
    北京大学哲学系搬到农村讲课的初步体会
    汪子嵩
    北京大学哲学系大部分师生共三百余人，于8月25日下乡，到北京大兴区黄村人民公社参加生产劳动，同时进行教学和科学研究活动。两个月来，经过参加深翻、秋收等经常的农业劳动、人民公社化运动、技术革命、文化革命和公社生产管理等各项实际工作，以及采用调查研究、总结经验、学习文件、鸣放辩论、批评与自我批评、思想小结和听报告等各项教学形式，使参加劳动生产和改革教学、科学研究、改造思想这四个方面有机地结合起来。大家感到收获很大，对于党中央教育必须与劳动生产相结合的方针有了比较具体的体会，认识到通过参加劳动与实际工作来学习理论是哲学系发展的正确方向，从而满怀信心，准备在这个基础上继续努力，将哲学系的教学改革进行到底，为建立共产主义大学的哲学系而奋斗。
    我们有以下三点初步体会。
  参加生产劳动和实际工作是改革
  教学、科学研究、思想改造的基础
    第一，参加生产劳动和实际工作，是改革教学、进行科学研究和思想改造的基础。我们规定：每天上午参加田间劳动：下午进行教学活动，如开讨论会学习文件和听报告等，但在农活紧张时也适当停课与农民一起昼夜突击；夜晚一般是参加农民的各种活动。在劳动之外，参加各种各样实际工作，如扫盲，办小学、农业中学、红专学校和红专大学，帮助农民学哲学和政治，开展各种文娱活动，和农民一起搞农具改革，研究农业技术，建立化肥厂、制糖厂，帮助农民办食堂和托儿所。有的同学还当大队长秘书，当分队副。在农村建立人民公社开展各项政治运动时，全体师生都是宣传员。我们已做到每人至少参加一项实际工作。
    事实证明，参加劳动和实际工作，对于脱离实际的知识分子是最大的教育。有人原来卑视体力劳动，认为农民干的是“笨活”，等到一参加劳动，才发现最笨的还是自己，即使是用最简单的钯和锄也都得虚心向农民学习，不然就要闹笑话。一个老教授说：“下乡之后，我才体会到：真正劳动的人没有得到享受，而我们这些享受很多的人却没有劳动。”他们开始检讨自己过去的资产阶级个人主义。学生们都积极参加劳动，同时也不断进行思想斗争。一个学生参加深耕突击后在日记上写道：“我虽然用了大劲，总是赶不上农民，心里想：还是铲浅一点，降低质量，赶上去吧，免得老落在后面而不好意思。但想起党中央关于深耕的指示，我咬紧牙关在农民后面赶，虽然汗流浃背，心里却十分愉快。”许多人通过这些思想斗争逐渐对劳动与劳动人民的感情开始变化。
    大家在劳动中和农民建立了深厚的友谊，又参加了各种实际工作，对农村的情况有了比较深入的体会，各班都进行调查研究，分析各阶层农民的思想动态，研究现在农村的各项矛盾。许多人都体会到只有在实际工作中学习才是生动而深刻的。三年级一个学生，在下乡前总认为下乡不能算学习。下乡之后，他参加建立人民公社的宣传工作，农民对他提出许多问题，逼得他一再反复回去找材料，钻研文件，进行学习。最后他说：“现在我对人民公社的优越性才真是认识得比较具体了。要是过去在学校里，我背了抽象的几条就以为自己已经完全懂得了，谁知道经不起农民一问。现在这样的学习才能学到真正的生动的马克思主义，这是在学校里再也不能学到的。”
  教学内容以政治运动为中心，
    教学目的在于改造主客观世界
    第二，教学内容要以当前政治运动为中心，教学目的是要改造客观世界和主观世界。我们要在下乡这一年期间学习辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义、社会主义与共产主义思想教育、政治经济学这三门基础理论课程的基本观点。下乡前我们曾就这三门课程的主要内容安排过一个教学计划，下乡后立即发现这样主观规定的计划是不能实现的。在农村学习只能以农村当前的政治运动为纲来进行学习。我们下乡不久正赶上农村展开轰轰烈烈地建立人民公社的运动，我们就抓紧学习建立人民公社的可能性、必要性和优越性等问题。大家一面宣传一面进行调查研究，还请乡和村的党支部书记给我们作报告，讲本乡的合作化史和建立公社前的各种内在矛盾，从而认识到建立公社是内在的必然趋势。最近公社实行供给制和进行共产主义教育，我们就结合学习分配与积累、劳动力的合理调整和组织等问题。公社实行供给制后，同学的思想震动很大，许多同学开始意识到要过共产主义关就必须不断革命、自觉革命。我们准备开始进行共产主义教育的学习，首先是从农民实行供给制来学习批判资产阶级法权的问题。曾经有一些同学提出来要将这三门课程分别开。按各自的系统来学习，也有一些同学主张“双轨制”，即以运动为纲而同时又按系统学习。9月底作思想小结时，就这个问题让同学进行鸣放辩论。最后，大家认识到这种要求按系统学习的意见就是过去那套“从大纲出发而不是从实际出发”的教条主义的学习方法，那样最多只能在几个概念名词上兜圈子。现在这样的学习方法才是真正符合“实践——理论——实践”的原则，是真正学习理论的方法。按照现在实际运动的发展来学习，就有无限丰富的内容，可以包括原来这三门课程的全部主要内容，而且它本身的发展也是有系统的。
    曾经有人抱着为了解决理论问题、写理论文章的目的去进行调查访问，这样得来的结果，往往是肤浅表面的，甚至有立场、观点的错误。我们强调学习的目的必须是为实践服务。它既是为了改造客观世界，同时又是为了改造主观世界，而这二者又是辩证地统一的。在康庄参加劳动的二年级同学在大搞技术革命时曾就三个问题展开过辩论：（1）搞什么？有人为了自己进行科学研究的目的，想搞一些“深奥”的技术改革；辩论结果认为应该服从当前农村生产的需要，首先是搞化肥等。（2）怎么搞法？有人要从城里去买许多洋仪器设备来搞；辩论结果认为应该以“土”为主，尽量利用农村的原料设备来搞。（3）依靠什么人？有人认为只能是少数人闭门搞，辩论结果认为应该依靠群众来搞，特别是应该和当地农民一起搞，注意培养农村技术干部。通过这样的辩论，既能顺利开展技术革命的工作，也对每个人的立场、观点、方法有了提高。
  主要的教学方法是鸣放辩论和
  自己教育自己
    第三，教学方法要以鸣放辩论、以群众自己教育自己为主。我们采用的教学方法是多种多样的：无论是在经常性的实际工作中学习，还是在中心政治运动中学习，都由党总支制定学习计划，规定这一阶段的目标和要求；由同学们作一些有关的调查研究，同时学习文件，进行鸣放；从鸣放提出的问题选择其中反映学生思想的作为重点进行辩论（有些问题就和农民一起讨论或参加农民的辩论），在辩论时再反复阅读经典著作和党的政策文件；在学习过程中也请公社和村的干部或其他同志作有关的报告；最后根据大家辩论的结果，由党总支或政治教员作总结报告。
    曾经有同学要求教师多讲课，认为这是学到理论的唯一途径。经过辩论否定了这种看法，确认了群众性的鸣放辩论应该是主要的教学方法。四年级学生所住的一个村子的农民在合作化前进城作小买卖的比较多，还有解放前当过伪军的，干部在工作中也有些缺点。有些同学就说：“这样的村子不够典型，这样的农民不是真正的农民，在这里没有什么可以学习的。”经过几次辩论，他们还坚持这种意见。最后是群众自己进行深入的调查研究，才发现原来农民进城作买卖时常遭受城里资本家的欺压，他们在解放前临时挂名当地方伪军也是为了躲避蒋介石匪帮的拉伕，所以农民终究还是劳动人民；干部的缺点是九个指头与一个指头的关系，农村中贫农就认为干部的优点勤劳负责是主要的，只有地、富、中农，才老嚷干部的缺点。这样，群众自己明确了阶级立场，解决了问题。事实证明用群众自己丰富多采的体会来做总结，就是成功的讲课，不然就会显得空洞。所以，教学工作必须走群众路线。
    这样说，是不是就不需要读书与教师的指导作用呢？不是的。学生感到最大的困难，就是他们面对着大量的事实材料，难于将它们提高到理性认识。这时，有教师参加的教学小组就要指定一些文件，来帮助同学从实际材料提高到理论认识。在这方面，毛泽东同志的著作、党的政策文件和报刊，马、恩、列、斯“论共产主义社会”等都起了极大的作用。我们反对为读书而读书，但是也坚决反对少数学生有轻视书籍的倾向，因为只有在马克思列宁主义理论指导下，才能对实际工作作出正确的总结和认识，才能进行教学和科学研究。
    整个教学是由党的总支（系一级）和支部（班一级）来全面安排和领导的，但教师仍有他们的重要作用。教研室与教学小组成为总支与支部在领导教学时的参谋部，他们可以具体计划学习步骤、提出文件、指导讨论时的理论线索，教师也可以作某些有关理论问题的辅导报告或总结报告。我们强调“能者为师”：不仅教师可以讲课，同学（集体或个人）只要在某一方面总结了经验就可以讲课，二年级党支书作的总结讲课很得好评。更重要的一面，是要请农民中的先进人物和农村工作干部给我们上课。师生们听了这些报告都说“这才是活的马克思主义”。
