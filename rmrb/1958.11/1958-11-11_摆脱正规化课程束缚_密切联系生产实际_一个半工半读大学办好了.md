Chengdu, November 3rd: Under the leadership of the Party Committee of the Southwest Radio Equipment Factory, the part-work, part-study university of the factory adopted a method combining workers, engineers, technicians, and teachers, and fully relied on the strength of the working masses to reform teaching, changing the tendency of teaching work to be divorced from production, divorced from reality, and blindly pursue formalization.

This part-work, part-study university was established in July of this year. Two majors were set up, with a total of more than 100 students. They study for three days a week and work for three days. The original teaching plan was entrusted to ordinary universities for help in formulating it. Although the teaching plan of similar majors in ordinary universities was simplified, merged, and adjusted to some extent, there were still shortcomings in the establishment of majors, curriculum arrangement, and teaching content, such as being divorced from production and divorced from reality. The high-frequency porcelain and magnetic material majors that were opened had little relationship with the factory's production, while the radio ceramic major that the factory urgently needed was not opened. Some unnecessary basic courses were opened, but some courses needed for production were not arranged. The course sequence was also arranged according to the conventional practice of ordinary universities, which first teach basic courses and then professional courses. The teaching materials were basically the same as those used in ordinary universities. The workers asked to simplify the teaching content, but some teachers said: If it is called a university, I have to teach according to the university's standards. Therefore, the workers commented: If we study like this for four years, we will become backward elements. What we can learn in two or three years, others have already learned in production.

The factory's Party committee studied these situations. In mid-September, it decided to thoroughly reform the teaching work in accordance with the Party's educational policy. However, teachers and some students disagreed. Some students believed that to become an engineer, they should focus on learning broad theoretical knowledge. Some had misunderstandings about quality issues and believed that the more book knowledge they learned, the higher the quality. Others were superstitious about ordinary universities and demanded that everything be in line with ordinary universities. In order to mobilize the working masses to actively participate in the teaching reform, the factory's Party committee organized workers, engineers, technicians, and teachers to study the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on education work and launched a debate on the above issues. After in-depth debate, the confused thinking was clarified. Everyone generally realized that the talents cultivated by the factory should be laborers with communist consciousness who meet the needs of the factory's production, who have the necessary theoretical knowledge and can solve practical problems in production. They must not simply learn more theory divorced from reality. The quality of learning should not be measured by the amount of book knowledge, but by learning for application and being able to solve problems in production. Factory-run schools must also proceed from the actual production of the factory and must not mechanically apply the things of regular universities, but must create their own school-running experience.

In the debate, the workers and teachers also discussed and proposed several principles that must be followed in reforming teaching work: (1) Teaching must be combined with production and serve production; (2) Politics, culture, and technology should be combined to strengthen communist ideological education; (3) In terms of courses, professional courses should be offered according to production needs, basic courses should be offered according to the needs of professional courses, and some professional courses and basic courses should be advanced simultaneously in combination with the characteristics of the factory; (4) Under the leadership of the Party committee, workers, engineers, technicians, and teachers should be combined to revise the teaching plan, compile teaching syllabuses and teaching materials; (5) According to the principle of "the able are teachers," teach and learn from each other.

Then, through many forums and discussions, the workers, based on these principles, put forward many opinions on reforming teaching and revising the teaching plan in all aspects such as the establishment of majors and teaching content. Jiang Yucheng and other workers had studied the already-opened course of Electrical Engineering in secondary technical schools in the past, but they were completely useless in production, so they had largely forgotten it, and they suggested that it should not be offered again. According to the factory's production situation, the workers urgently needed to study Kiln Engineering, but the school did not include it in the teaching plan. The workers' suggestion to add this course was immediately supported by engineers and technicians. In addition, the factory's Party committee also convened a joint meeting of workers, engineers, technicians, and teacher representatives to jointly study the new teaching plan.

After mass discussions, the university has formulated a new teaching plan, and the teaching work has begun to show a new look. The high-frequency porcelain and magnetic material majors have been cancelled and replaced with the radio ceramic major that meets the needs of production; the insulation material and resistor capacitor major has also been divided into two majors after repeated research to avoid the defect of learning content that is broad but not in-depth. Courses such as Electrical Engineering and Enterprise Organization and Planning, which are not closely related to production or whose content is repetitive and outdated, have been cancelled, reduced, or merged, and new courses such as Kiln Engineering, Ceramic Components and Formulas have been added according to the workers' suggestions. Political courses also account for about a quarter of the teaching time. The teaching content also fully absorbs the wisdom of the masses, adding inventions and rationalization proposals of the factory, as well as new scientific and technological achievements. The number of courses offered by the school has been reduced from more than 20 to 15. Students can graduate in just three years and become new types of laborers with the level of engineers in their respective fields, shortening the original school system by one year. The workers excitedly call the new teaching plan a "more, faster, better, and more economical" plan.

Now, the teaching reform work of this school has come to an end. The factory's Party committee is preparing to launch the masses to compile teaching syllabuses and teaching materials in accordance with the new teaching plan, and to further reform teaching methods. Other schools run by this factory have also learned from this experience and have begun to reform their teaching work. (Attached picture)

    摆脱正规化课程束缚　密切联系生产实际
    一个半工半读大学办好了
    本报成都3日电　西南无线电器材厂半工半读大学在工厂党委领导下，采用工人、工程技术人员、教师三结合的办法，充分依靠工人群众的力量进行教学改革，改变了教学工作中脱离生产、脱离实际和盲目追求正规化的倾向。
    这个半工半读大学是在今年7月开办的。设立了两个专业，学员共一百多人。每周三天学习，三天劳动。原来的教学计划是委托普通大学帮助制订的，虽然比普通大学同类专业的教学计划作了些精简、合并和调整，但是，在专业设置、课程安排和教学内容等方面，仍然存在着脱离生产、脱离实际的缺点。开设的高频瓷和磁性材料专业和工厂生产关系不大，而工厂迫切需要的无线电陶瓷专业却没有开设。开了些不必要的基础课，有些生产上需要的课程却没有安排。课程次序也是按普通大学先讲基础课后讲专业课的常规排定的。教材更基本上沿用了普通大学的一套，工人要求精简讲授内容，有些教师却说：要是叫作大学，我就得照大学的一套教。工人们因而议论说：这样学习四年，我们会变成落后分子。我们两、三年后才能学到的，别人早在生产中学会了。
    工厂党委研究了这些情况，9月中旬，决定按党的教育方针对教学工作进行彻底改革。但是，教师和部分学员却不同意。有些学员认为要作工程师就要着重学习广博的理论知识。有的对质量问题有误解，认为学的书本知识愈多质量愈高。还有些人迷信普通大学，要求一切向普通大学看齐。为了发动工人群众积极参加教学改革，工厂党委组织工人、工程技术人员和教师学习了中共中央、国务院关于教育工作的指示，就以上问题展开辩论。经过深入辩论，混乱思想澄清了。大家普遍认识到，工厂办学培养的人才，应该是适应工厂生产需要的既有必要理论知识又能解决生产实际问题的有共产主义觉悟的劳动者，决不能脱离实际地单纯多学理论。学习质量也不应该用书本知识多少来衡量，而是要学以致用，能解决生产中的问题。工厂办学还必须从本厂生产实际出发，决不能用正规大学的东西生搬硬套，要创造自己的办学经验。
    在辩论中，工人们和教师还讨论提出了改革教学工作必须遵循的几项原则：（1）教学必须结合生产、为生产服务；（2）政治、文化、技术三结合，加强共产主义思想教育；（3）在课程上，按生产需要开设专业课，按专业课需要开设基础课，并结合工厂特点，部分专业课与基础课同时并进；（4）在党委领导下，工人、工程技术人员和教师三结合，修订教学计划，自编教学大纲和教材；（5）按能者为师原则，互教互学。
    接着，工人们通过多次座谈、讨论，根据这些原则，就专业设置、教学内容等各方面提出了许多改革教学、修订教学计划的意见。已经开设的课程电机学，工人江玉成等过去在中等技术学校曾经学过，但在生产中完全用不上，因而大部忘却，他们建议不必再开设。按工厂生产情况，工人迫切需要学习窑炉学，但学校却没有列入教学计划。工人们提出增加这门课程的建议后，立刻得到工程技术人员支持。此外，工厂党委还召开了工人、工程技术人员和教师代表的联席会，共同研究新教学计划。
    经过群众性的讨论，这所大学已制订出新的教学计划，教学工作开始呈现新的面貌。高频瓷与磁性材料专业已经取消，改设了适应生产需要的无线电陶瓷专业；绝缘材料与电阻电容器专业也在反复研究后，分设为两个专业，以避免学习内容广而不深的缺陷。与生产关系不大或内容重复、陈旧的电机学、企业组织与计划等课程，有的取消，有的压缩或合并，并根据工人建议增加了窑炉学、陶瓷原件与配方等新课程。政治课也占到教学时数四分之一左右。教学内容上也比较充分地吸收了群众智慧，增加了本厂创造发明及合理化建议，以及新的科学技术成就。学校开设课程已从原有的二十多门减少到十五门。学员只需三年时间就可毕业，成为本专业范围内具有工程师水平的新型劳动者，比原来学制缩短了一年。工人们都兴奋地把新的教学计划称为多、快、好、省的计划。
    现在，这个学校教学改革工作已告一段落。工厂党委正准备按照新教学计划，发动群众编写教学大纲和教材，并进一步改革教学方法。这个工厂开办的其他学校也已学习这一经验，开始进行教学工作的改革。（附图片）
