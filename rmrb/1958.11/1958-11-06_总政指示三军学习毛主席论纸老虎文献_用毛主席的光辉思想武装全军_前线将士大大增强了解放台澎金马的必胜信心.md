Xinhua News Agency, November 5th. The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a telephone conference on the evening of the 4th, instructing the entire army to extensively study the important document "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers." Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, spoke at the meeting. He said that the People's Daily's recent publication of "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" is a very important document. This document is Chairman Mao's most profound analysis of the essence of imperialism and all reactionaries and their inevitable demise, as well as the basic characteristics of the current international situation. It can greatly enhance the morale of the people and greatly diminish the prestige of the enemy. As the People's Daily editorial note says, how to understand the issue of revolutionary forces and reactionary forces is still a major issue in China and worldwide. Many people are unable to resolve it. Since it is a major issue and has not been resolved, it must be resolved. Seriously studying Chairman Mao's important document can solve this problem. Many comrades in our army have a relatively deep understanding of Chairman Mao's famous thesis in the long revolutionary struggle. Leaders at all levels should carefully organize and conscientiously conduct the study of this document. This study is of great significance. It can shatter people's superstition in U.S. imperialism and completely liberate people's minds.

Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian said that all units of the army should immediately organize the vast number of officers to carefully read and discuss Chairman Mao's document and related articles in the newspapers, and organize cadres at all levels to give reports and lectures to soldiers, organize soldiers to hold discussions and debates, and further arm all officers and soldiers with Chairman Mao's brilliant thought.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, November 5th. The publication of the document "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" has brought great encouragement to the vast number of officers and soldiers on the Fujian Front. They pointed out that Chairman Mao's brilliant strategic thought has guided the People's Liberation Army to defeat powerful enemies and liberate mainland China in the past, and will continue to guide the People's Liberation Army to achieve great victories in the struggle against imperialist aggression, to complete the reunification of the motherland, and to defend the motherland and defend peace in the future.

Commanders of the People's Liberation Army, who have been engaged in long-term revolutionary struggles under the leadership of the Party, vividly explained the truth that the revolutionary forces pointed out by Chairman Mao are invincible, and that imperialism and all reactionaries are bound to fail, with their own experiences. Li Huaiyi, a lieutenant colonel from the leading organ of the frontline troops, recalled the path he has taken in the past two decades of struggle, deeply understanding the correctness of Chairman Mao's judgment. He said that in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese imperialism, relying on its superior equipment and Chiang Kai-shek's policy of non-resistance, ran rampant in our country for a time. Our troops in the Bohai Sea region of Shandong could not even concentrate a company for activities, and could only wage guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. It was truly a time of dark clouds. At this time, Chairman Mao pointed out the three periods of the War of Resistance Against Japan to the people of the whole country, pointing out that the final victory must belong to us, bringing great encouragement and strength to the people of the whole country, and finally defeated the Japanese robbers. In 1946, Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary civil war, and millions of troops, armed with American weapons, launched a frantic attack on the liberated areas, which also looked very ferocious. But in the end, we eliminated millions of Kuomintang troops equipped with American equipment and liberated the entire mainland of China. These histories vividly illustrate the law that all reactionaries are bound to perish.

Commanders and fighters of the frontline naval forces, air force units, and artillery units, who have achieved brilliant victories in punishing the Chiang army, have further increased their confidence in opposing U.S. imperialist interference and liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu after initially studying this article. Wei Yuanwu, commander of a frontline gunboat unit, used the fact that he fought guerrillas in the Dabie Mountains in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan and saw the People's Navy develop from a few old motor sailing ships and small gunboats to a military service with tremendous power today to prove Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that revolutionary forces are invincible. On September 1, Wei Yuanwu commanded three gunboats to defeat a Chiang army fleet that was several times larger than ours in terms of quantity and tonnage, and sank a Chiang army warship that was several times larger than the gunboat. He said that this specific battle vividly proved the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao that it is people, not weapons, that determine the outcome of war.

    总政指示三军学习毛主席论纸老虎文献
    用毛主席的光辉思想武装全军
    前线将士大大增强了解放台澎金马的必胜信心
    新华社5日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部4日晚上召开电话会议，布置全军广泛展开学习“毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”这一重要文献。总政治部副主任刘志坚中将在会上讲了话。他说，人民日报最近发表的“毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”是一个很重要的文献。这个文献是毛主席对帝国主义和一切反动派的本质及其必然死亡以及对当前国际局势的基本特点的最深刻的分析。它可以大长人民志气，大灭敌人威风。正像人民日报编辑部按语所说的，怎样认识革命力量和反动力量的问题，在中国，在世界范围内，都还是一个大问题，有许多人总是不得解决，既是大问题，又没有解决，就必须解决它。认真学习毛主席这个重要文献，就可以解决这个问题。我们军队很多同志对主席这个著名的论断，在长期的革命斗争中有比较深刻的体会。各级领导应当好好组织和认真进行对这一文献的学习。这个学习具有巨大意义。它可以大破人们对美帝国主义的迷信，彻底解放人们的思想。
    刘志坚中将说，全军各部队应当立即组织广大军官认真阅读和讨论毛主席的这一文献和报纸上有关的文章，并组织各级干部普遍向战士作报告、讲演，组织战士座谈、讨论，鸣放、辩论，进一步用毛主席的光辉思想，把全军官兵武装起来。
    新华社福建前线5日电　“毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”文献的发表，给福建前线广大官兵带来了巨大的鼓舞。他们指出，毛泽东同志这一光辉的战略思想，过去引导着人民解放军战胜了强大的敌人，解放了中国大陆，今后将继续引导人民解放军在反对帝国主义侵略、完成祖国统一和保卫祖国、保卫和平的斗争中取得伟大的胜利。
    在党的领导下进行了长期革命斗争的人民解放军指挥员们，以亲身经历生动地说明毛主席所指出的革命力量不可战胜、帝国主义和一切反动派必然失败这一真理。前线部队领导机关李怀义中校回忆他近二十年斗争中所走过的道路，深深体会到毛主席论断的正确。他说，抗日战争初期，日本帝国主义依仗优势装备和蒋介石的不抵抗政策，在我国横行霸道一时。我们在山东渤海地区的部队，连一个连都不能集中活动，只能在敌后打游击战，真是乌云满天。就在这时，毛主席对全国人民指明了抗日战争的三个时期，指出最后胜利必定属于我们，给全国人民带来了巨大的鼓舞和力量，最后，终于打败了日本强盗。1946年蒋介石发动了反人民的内战，几百万军队拿着美国武器向解放区疯狂进攻，看样子也很凶恶。可是我们最后还是消灭了美式装备的好几百万国民党军队，解放了全国大陆。这些历史都生动地说明了一切反动派必然死亡的规律。
    在严惩蒋军战斗中取得了光辉胜利的前线海军部队、空军部队和炮兵部队的指挥员战斗员们，初步学习了这篇文章后，更增加了他们反对美帝国主义干涉、一定要解放台、澎、金、马的必胜信心。前线某炮艇部队部队长魏垣武用他抗日战争初期在大别山区打游击，一直到看到人民海军由几艘陈旧的机帆船和小炮艇发展到今天具有巨大威力的一个军种的事实，来证明毛主席革命力量不可战胜的英明论断。魏垣武在9月1日曾指挥三艘炮艇打败了在数量上、吨位上都是数倍于我的一支蒋军舰队，并且击沉了一艘比炮艇大数倍的蒋军军舰。他说，这一个具体战斗就生动地证明了毛主席指出的决定战争胜负的是人而不是武器的这个真理。
