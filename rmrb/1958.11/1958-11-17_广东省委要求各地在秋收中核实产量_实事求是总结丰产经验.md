The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee Requires All Regions to Verify Output During Autumn Harvest
Summarize High-Yield Experiences Based on Facts

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on the 13th, requiring a realistic attitude towards autumn harvest output, conscientiously verifying the yield, not reporting a single jin less, nor a single jin more.

    The notice stated that the autumn harvest is currently in full swing throughout the province, with nearly half of the late rice already harvested. Yields are increasing, and many large and small-scale high-yield "satellites" are emerging in various regions; high-yield fields of 6,000-7,000 jin or more, and even 10,000 jin or more, are continuously appearing. These high-yield experiences are extremely valuable and deserve attention. Timely and systematic summarization and promotion of these high-yield experiences will be of great significance for carrying out the 10,000-jin per mu movement next year. This will create a very favorable foundation for a greater leap forward in grain production next year. To this end: 1. All regions should immediately combine the autumn harvest with the verification of output and the summarization of high-yield experiences. A responsible and realistic attitude should be adopted towards output, opposing both underreporting and overreporting. Only under the premise of strictly verifying output is it possible to summarize high-yield experiences effectively. 2. Party committee secretaries at all levels should personally take command, selecting several of the highest-yielding, high-yield fields and leading technical cadres, production experts, and company, platoon, and squad leaders to personally harvest, thresh, dry, and weigh the crops. Meetings should then be held on-site to systematically summarize high-yield experiences.

    (Reported by this newspaper) "Southern Daily" published an editorial entitled "Verify Output, Summarize Experiences" regarding the notice issued by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee on the 13th. The editorial stated that these days, the autumn harvest in Guangdong Province has entered a busy stage. Auspicious news of large-scale harvests is frequently reported from all directions. At this time of celebrating the harvest, reaping all the fruits of the year's hard work is the primary task. However, to make the autumn harvest work more meaningful, we must not only harvest all the grain that can be harvested, but also raise the ideological understanding of the broad masses and all cadres a step further through the extraordinary bumper harvest of late rice. To do this, we must add one more element: verify output and summarize experiences.

    The editorial stated that summarizing high-yield experiences has two aspects of significance. On the one hand, it enables the broad masses and all cadres to further recognize the great meaning of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results" through the great achievements of hard work; to further recognize the necessity of promoting advanced technologies and measures; to further recognize the power of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production proposed by Chairman Mao, thereby further inspiring the production enthusiasm of the broad masses and preparing their minds for a greater leap forward next year and for the movement to produce 10,000 jin of rice per mu next year. On the other hand, it is to use large-scale high yields and high-output satellites to make a comprehensive settlement with the "accounting faction," a comprehensive criticism of the "wait-and-see faction," and a comprehensive education of the "skeptical faction," so that all these people will surrender in the face of the facts of the extraordinary bumper harvest. Only by doing these things can righteousness be promoted, truth can prevail, and the ideological foundation for a greater leap forward next year can be solid.

    The editorial stated that summarizing high-yield experiences requires honesty and a realistic approach, reporting the actual amount, "not reporting a single jin less, nor a single jin more." Concealing production and underreporting, or underproducing and overreporting, are not honest attitudes, cannot play a role in improving the ideological understanding of the masses, and can only benefit the "accounting faction" and the "wait-and-see faction," giving them something to talk about and allowing them to make irresponsible remarks.

    The editorial stated that in order to verify output and summarize experiences that can truly guide production next year, party committee secretaries at all levels must personally take command, personally go to the fields to harvest, dry the grain, weigh it, and preside over the meetings to summarize experiences. The phenomenon of estimating output based solely on "experience" must be terminated; the phenomenon of accepting harvests without weighing them must be corrected; and the situation where cadres are only responsible for harvesting but not for threshing must be changed. The style of cadres working with the masses to conscientiously summarize high-yield experiences must be promoted, and the method of cadres, the masses, and figures from the "accounting faction" and the "wait-and-see faction," etc., harvesting together must be popularized.

### 广东省委要求各地在秋收中核实产量  实事求是总结丰产经验

    广东省委要求各地在秋收中核实产量
    实事求是总结丰产经验
    本报讯　中共广东省委13日要求对秋收产量采取实事求是的态度，认真核实产量，不少报一斤，也不多报一斤。
    通知说，目前全省秋收进入大忙，晚稻已收割了将近一半。产量越收越高，各地都出现了许多大、小面积的高产卫星；六、七千斤以上和万斤以上的高产田正不断出现。这些高产经验十分宝贵，很值得重视。及时地、系统地总结和推广这些高产经验，对明年开展万斤亩运动将有很大的意义，这将为明年粮食生产的更大跃进创造极为有利的基础。为此，一、各地应立即结合秋收，一面核实产量，一面总结丰产经验。对产量要采取认真负责、实事求是的态度，既要反对少报一斤，也要反对多报一斤，只有在严格核实产量的前提下，才有可能总结好丰产经验。二、各级党委书记要亲自挂帅，选择若干块最高产的丰产田，带领技术干部、生产能手以及营、连、排长，亲自收打，亲自晒干，亲自过秤。并即在现场举行会议，系统总结丰产经验。
    本报讯　“南方日报”就中共广东省委13日通知，发表题为“核实产量，总结经验”的社论。社论说，这几天，广东省的秋收已进入大忙阶段。来自四面八方大面积的丰收捷音到处频传。在这喜庆丰收的时候，把苦战终年的劳动成果全部收获到手，是当前的首要任务。但是为了把秋收工作做得更有意义，我们不光要收到全部可能收到的粮食，而且要通过晚稻特大丰收，把广大群众和全体干部的思想认识提高一步，那就必须再加上一条：核实产量，总结经验。
    社论说，总结丰产经验有两方面的意义。一方面，使广大群众和全体干部通过苦战的伟大成果，进一步认识“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省”的总路线的伟大意义，进一步认识推广先进技术和先进措施的必要，进一步认识毛主席提出的农业生产的“八字宪法”的威力，从而进一步启发广大群众的生产积极性，为明年的更大跃进、为明年的亩产万斤稻谷的运动做好思想准备。另方面，是通过总结丰产经验，用大面积的丰产，用高额增产的卫星，对“算账派”来一次总清算，对“观潮派”来一次总批判，对“怀疑派”来一次总教育，使所有这些人在特大丰收的事实面前缴械投降。只有做了这些，正气才会伸张，真理才会抬头，明年更大跃进的思想基础才能牢靠。
    社论说，总结丰产经验，要老老实实，实事求是，有多少报多少，“不少报一斤，也不多报一斤”，瞒产少报，少产多报，都不是老老实实的态度，都不能起到提高群众思想认识的作用，都只能有利于“算账派”、“观潮派”，使他们有了话柄，大放厥词。
    社论说，为了核实产量，总结出真正能够指导明年生产的经验，这就要各级党委书记亲自挂帅，亲自到田间去收割，去晒谷，去过秤，去主持总结经验的会议。目前只凭“经验”估产的现象必须终止；验收不过秤的现象必须纠正；干部管割不管打的情况必须改变。干部跟群众一起，认真总结丰产经验的作风必须提倡，干部、群众和“算账派”、“观潮派”等等人物一起收割的方法必须推广。
