To a Happy Tomorrow
——After Watching the Play "Flame of Youth"
Yang Haibo, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League

"Forward, the dawn is ahead, comrades fight, use our bayonets and guns to open our own way...."

When I walked out of the theater after watching the play "Flame of Youth," this magnificent battle song of the old generation of Soviet Communist Youth League members always vibrated and lingered in my ears. The heroic images of Liang Bining, Anton, Natasha, Xiao Yefenqike, Feijia, Dasha, Mr. Glasses... deeply moved me. My excited mood could not calm down for a long time. This is a good play, and I hope young men and women comrades will go and see it.

The play "Flame of Youth" depicts the struggle and life of Soviet Communist Youth League members during the Soviet Civil War. 1918-1920 was a great and cruel era of revolutionary struggle. The flames of war enveloped the young Soviet Republic. Foreign interventionists, united with domestic counter-revolutionary forces, attempted to strangle the newborn of the proletarian revolution. Three-quarters of the territory once fell into their hands. The Soviet motherland was in a very critical situation. The Soviet Communist Youth League was born in such difficult years. From the first day of its establishment, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and Lenin, the Soviet Communist Youth League took out all its revolutionary enthusiasm and youthful strength to fight against domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries, helping the Party and the people to defend the fruits of the October Revolution.

The play "Flame of Youth" successfully created the glorious images of Liang Bining, Anton, Natasha... and other Soviet first-generation Communist Youth League members. They were mostly "born of the poor," some ordinary young people who had "suffered all the pain" and "came out of the cellar." They turned themselves over after the October Revolution, gained freedom, and were no longer willing to return to their previous humiliating lives. They all had a fiery heart. They were tempered in the revolutionary furnace to become "brave, daring, and reckless" people. They had extreme love for the revolution and infinite hatred for the enemy. For the sake of work, they endured hunger and cold, forgot to eat and sleep, and never cared about personal gains or losses, or considered their personal safety. They sang the praises of brave people and despised those cowards, empty talkers, or insidious neutralists. They had an unremitting fighting will. When the front line was in danger, they joined the Red Army, advanced bravely, and did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives. Cruel punishments and bloody terror could not scare their heroic spirit and fighting will. They were worthy of being the Party's loyal and reliable combat assistants.

What kind of power made Liang Bining, Anton, Natasha... and other Communist Youth League members possess the spirit of perseverance, bravery, fearlessness, fortitude, courage, and optimism? It was because they understood why they had to fight. They were convinced that today's arduous struggle and bloodshed would be exchanged for freedom and happiness tomorrow. They were full of infinite hope for the future. When Communist Youth League member Anton was working secretly in the attic, when the heavy pressure on his chest made it difficult for him to breathe, when the needle of the assassin was ringing outside the window, and the German boots were walking up the stairs, he imagined that they could stand freely in the square, with crowds of people, red flags flying, and gongs and drums blaring, and they would become the masters of the country! When the enemy had just been repelled and the struggle and life were still very difficult, they realized that they were beginning a great life and were building history. They imagined that life in the future would become very beautiful, filled with bright and splendid cities everywhere, fruit trees, parks, countless palaces being built, factories becoming beautiful, clean, and comfortable, and even imagined that the black coal mines would also become white, clean, and bright mines. When Natasha was locked in prison and could only live until dawn, she was still thinking about how her people would enter the city and how the red flag would fly over the city. She firmly believed that the future must move towards a communist society, and that her little Yelena would certainly be able to live a very happy, glorious, and great life in the future; it was precisely because they had such a great communist ideal and purpose of life that they could face any difficulties and hardships with optimism and courage, move forward bravely, and contribute their youthful strength, their blood, and even their lives to the cause of human liberation. No wonder the female Communist Youth League member Natasha would utter such heroic words before her execution: "If I didn't only have one life, but had ten, then I would contribute all my lives as if I were contributing this only one, without the slightest regret."

The Soviet Communist Youth League has experienced a glorious fighting path over the past forty years. It is precisely because millions of Soviet Communist Youth League members, under the cultivation and leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, together with the entire Soviet people, have continuously carried forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of Liang Bining, Anton, Natasha, and others, who were not afraid of hardships and struggled heroically for the cause of communism. After the victorious end of the domestic war, they passed through numerous tests in new difficult periods such as the restoration of the national economy, industrialization, agricultural collectivization, the Great Patriotic War, and the post-war Five-Year Plans with a spirit of high morale and indomitable spirit, making the Soviet Union today the most powerful socialist country with strong industry and agriculture and the most advanced science and technology. However, the Soviet Communist Youth League members are not satisfied with today's achievements, and are fighting together with the Party and the Soviet people to surpass the United States in the average output per capita of major products in the shortest possible time. The spirit of the Soviet Communist Youth League members' heroic struggle for the cause of communism has set the best example for the youth of our country.

Today, the 600 million people of our country are fighting to realize the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to "work hard for three years and fundamentally change the face of the country." After only one year of hard work this year, we have achieved unprecedented great victories in industrial and agricultural production and all other fronts in ancient and modern history, both at home and abroad. We are about to enter the decisive second year of hard work, and we will build socialism at a higher speed with a more high-spirited spirit of hard work. Under such circumstances, the performance of the play "Flame of Youth" has profound practical significance. We need the spirit of heroic struggle possessed by Liang Bining, Anton, Natasha... these Soviet first-generation Communist Youth League members. "Flame of Youth" will greatly inspire the fighting will of the youth of our country, making the youth of our country more deeply aware that today's hard work is for tomorrow's happiness; the youth of our country swear to use their own hands to draw the newest and most beautiful pictures, and use their hard work to realize the ideal of a better and happier life. We thank the Soviet writer Gorbatov for creating such an excellent work, and we also thank the Beijing People's Art Theater for doing such a meaningful work.

In various revolutionary historical periods in our country, there have also been many old Communist Youth League members like Liang Bining, Anton, Natasha, Xiao Yefenqike... We sincerely hope that the writers and old comrades in our country will write their immortal feats and noble qualities into works, so that they can also appear on the screens and stages of our country, so that the current generation of youth in our country can draw endless spiritual strength from them, better inherit and carry forward their revolutionary traditions, and be more heroic shock forces in building socialism and communism!

    为了幸福的明天
    ——话剧“青春的火焰”观后
    中国共产主义青年团中央宣传部长　杨海波
    “走上前去啊，曙光在前，同志们奋斗，用我们的刺刀和枪炮，开自己的路。……”
    当我看完话剧“青春的火焰”走出剧场的时候，苏联老一辈共青团员们的这个雄壮的战斗的歌声，始终在我耳畔震荡、萦回，梁比宁、安东、娜塔莎、小叶芬契克、费佳、达莎、眼镜先生……这些坚贞不屈、英勇无畏的英雄形象，深深地感动着我。激动的心情很久不能平静下来。这是一个好戏，我希望男女青年同志们去看看这个戏。
    “青春的火焰”这个戏描写的是苏联国内战争时期苏联共青团员们的斗争和生活。1918—1920年，这是伟大的残酷的革命斗争的年代。战火笼罩在年轻的苏维埃共和国的上空。外国干涉者联合国内的反革命力量企图扼杀无产阶级革命的初生儿。四分之三的国土曾经落到了他们的手里。苏维埃祖国处境万分危急。苏联共青团正是诞生在这样艰难的岁月里。苏联共青团从它成立的第一天起，就在苏联共产党和列宁的领导下，拿出自己的全部革命热情和青春力量去同国内外反革命作斗争，帮助党和人民保卫十月革命胜利的果实。
    话剧“青春的火焰”成功地塑造了梁比宁、安东、娜塔莎……等苏联第一批共青团员的光辉形象。他们大都是“穷人出身”，是一些“受尽了痛苦”“从地窖里走出来的”平凡的青年。他们在十月革命以后翻了身，得到了自由，再也不愿回复以前的屈辱生活。他们都有着一颗火热的心。他们在革命的熔炉里锻炼成为“英勇果敢、不顾死活”的人。他们对革命极端热爱，对敌人无限痛恨。为了工作，他们忍饥挨冻，废寝忘食，丝毫也不计较个人得失，考虑个人的安危。他们歌颂英勇的人们，鄙视那些懦怯者、空谈家或阴险的中立者。他们有着永不懈怠的战斗意志，当前线危急的时候，他们就参加红军，勇往直前，毫不吝惜自己的生命。残酷的刑罚、血腥的恐怖，都吓唬不了他们的英勇精神和战斗意志。他们不愧为党的忠实可靠的战斗助手。
    是什么力量使得梁比宁、安东、娜塔莎……这些共青团员具有坚贞不屈、英勇无畏、刚毅果敢、乐观豪迈的精神呢？是因为他们懂得了为什么才要去进行斗争。他们确信，今天的艰苦斗争，流血牺牲，会换来明天的自由幸福。他们对未来充满了无限的希望。当共青团员安东在秘密工作的天棚上像石头一般压在胸前使人喘不过气来的时候，当刺马针在窗外响着，德国人的皮靴走上楼梯上的时候，他就想像着他们能自由地站在广场上，人山人海，红旗飘扬，锣鼓喧天，他们将成为国家的主人翁！当敌人刚被击退，斗争和生活仍然十分艰苦的时候，他们就认识到他们是在开始过一个伟大的生活，正在建造着历史。他们幻想，将来世界上的生活会变得非常美丽，到处充满了光辉灿烂的城市，果树、公园、盖起无数的宫殿，工厂变得又漂亮、又干净、又舒服，甚至想像采煤的黑矿井也要变成白色的、清洁明亮的矿井。当娜塔莎关在狱里，仅只能活到黎明之前了，她还在想着自己人怎样打进城来，城市上空红旗将怎样飘荡。她坚信未来一定要走向共产主义社会，她的小叶莲娜将来的生活一定能过非常美满的光荣伟大的生活；正是由于他们有着伟大的共产主义理想这样的生活目的，他们才能面对任何艰难困苦而乐观豪迈，勇往直前，为人类解放事业贡献出自己的青春力量，自己的鲜血，甚至于生命。也无怪乎女共青团员娜塔莎在临刑前会说出这样的豪言壮语：“如果我不是只有一条生命，而是有十条的话，那末我也要像贡献出这唯一的一条生命一样，把所有的生命都贡献出来，丝毫都不惋惜。”
    苏联共青团四十年来经历了一条光荣的战斗道路。正是由于苏联千百万名共青团员在苏联共产党的培育和领导下，同全体苏联人民一道，不断发扬像梁比宁、安东、娜塔莎等人这种为共产主义事业而不畏艰苦、英勇奋斗的光荣革命传统，在胜利地结束了国内战争以后，又以斗志昂扬、顽强不屈的精神，而无难色地通过了恢复国民经济、工业化、农业集体化、卫国战争以及战后的几个五年计划等等新的艰苦战斗时期的无数的考验，使得苏联今天能够成为具有强大的工农业和最先进的科学技术的最强大的社会主义国家。但是苏联共青团员们并不满足今天的成就，又在党的领导下和苏联人民一道，为在最短时期内在主要产品方面按人口平均产量超过美国而奋战了。苏联共青团员这种为共产主义事业而英勇奋战的精神为我国青年树立了最好的榜样。
    今天，我国六亿人民正在为实现党中央和毛主席提出的“苦战三年，基本改变面貌”的伟大号召而战斗。仅仅经过今年一年的苦战，我们便在工农业生产和其他一切战线上取得了古今中外史无前例的伟大胜利。我们即将进入具有决定意义的苦战第二年，我们将以更加高昂的苦战精神，用更高的速度来建设社会主义。在这样的形势下，话剧“青春的火焰”的演出，有着深刻的现实意义。我们需要梁比宁、安东、娜塔莎……这些苏联第一批共青团员的所具有的英勇奋战的精神。“青春的火焰”将会大大地鼓舞我国青年的战斗意志，使我国青年更深刻地认识到今天的苦战就是为了明天的幸福；我国青年誓用自己的双手去绘制出最新最美的图画，用自己辛勤劳动来实现美好幸福的理想。我们感谢苏联作家戈尔巴朵夫同志创作了这样优秀的作品，我们也感谢北京人民艺术剧院作了这样一件有意义的工作。
    在我国各个革命历史时期里，也有着许多像梁比宁、安东、娜塔莎、小叶芬契克……这样的老共青团员。我们诚挚地希望我国的作家和老同志们把他们的不朽功勋和崇高品质写成作品，使他们也能出现在我国的银幕和舞台上，使我国现在一代的青年从中吸取无尽的精神力量，更好地继承和发扬他们的革命传统，做建设社会主义和共产主义的更英勇的突击手！
