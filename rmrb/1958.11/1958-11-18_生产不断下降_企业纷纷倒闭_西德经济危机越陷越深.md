Xinhua News Agency Report: The signs of crisis in the West German economy are continuing to develop.

The three sectors where the crisis signs are most prominent are the coal mining industry, the steel industry, and the textile industry.

The West German coal mining sales crisis, which began this spring, is continuing to worsen. As of the beginning of November, the total amount of unsold coal in the Ruhr area had reached a peak of 12 million tons, exceeding the highest record of total unsold German coal production during the Great Capitalist Economic Crisis of 1929-1933. According to the most conservative estimate by West German coal owners, the total amount of unsold coal will exceed the 14 million ton mark before New Year's Day in 1959. As a result, one-third of the existing mines will be forced to close, and at least 150,000 miners will lose their jobs.

West German steel production has been declining continuously since the beginning of this year due to reduced orders. The output of crude steel in October this year decreased by 362,000 tons compared with the same month last year, a decrease of 11.7%. The output of heavy steel plates even decreased by 28% in the third quarter of this year. Even according to the most optimistic estimates of West German steel capitalists, West German crude steel production this year will at most reach 23 million tons, which is not only 1.5 million tons less than last year, but also 200,000 tons less than in 1956.

The situation of unsold goods and reduced production in the textile industry is very serious. Due to difficulties in sales, the operating hours of textile factories have been reduced by an average of 14% since January this year. New orders received by the textile industry in the first half of this year decreased by about 21% compared with the same period last year. The current inventory of unsold textiles is equivalent to the total output of the entire textile industry for three months. Thirty-five of the seventy-one glove weaving factories in West Germany have been forced to close, and three more textile companies went bankrupt in early October.

In addition to the above three sectors, the situation in many other production sectors is also not optimistic. For example, the existing orders for West Germany's heavy machinery manufacturing industry are not enough to maintain operations for three months; the shipbuilding industry has laid off 20,000 workers since the beginning of this year due to continuous reduction in orders; the railway transportation industry also announced the reduction of 7,000 employees in mid-October.

### 生产不断下降　企业纷纷倒闭  西德经济危机越陷越深

    生产不断下降　企业纷纷倒闭
    西德经济危机越陷越深
    据新华社讯　西德经济中的危机征象正在继续发展。
    危机征象表露得最突出的三个部门是采煤业、钢铁工业和纺织工业。
    今年春季开始的西德采煤业销售危机正在继续恶化。到11月初为止，鲁尔全区滞销的存煤总量已经达到一千二百万吨的高峰，超过了1929—1933年资本主义经济大危机年代中德国煤产滞销总量的最高纪录。据西德煤业主最保守的估计，到1959年元旦以前，滞销的存煤总量将突破一千四百万吨大关。为此，现有矿井的三分之一将被迫关闭，至少十五万矿工将失业。
    西德钢铁生产由于订货减少，今年以来不断减退。今年10月份的原钢产量比去年同月减少了三十六万二千吨，即减少了11.7％。厚钢板的产量在今年第三季度中甚至减少了28％。即使按照西德钢铁资本家最乐观的估计，今年西德原钢产量至多也只能达到两千三百万吨，不但要比去年少一百五十万吨，而且比1956年也要少二十万吨。
    纺织工业中滞销和减产的情况十分严重。由于销路困难，从今年1月以来，各纺织厂的开工时间平均缩短了14％。今年上半年纺织工业获得的新订货比去年同期减少约21％。目前滞销纺织品的库存量已经相当于整个纺织业三个月的总产量。西德七十一家手套织造厂已经有三十五家被迫歇业，10月初又有三家纺织企业倒闭。
    除以上三个部门外，其他许多生产部门的情况也并不美妙。例如，西德重型机器制造业的现有订货不足维持三个月的开工；造船业今年以来因订货不断减少已经解雇工人两万名；铁路运输业也在10月中旬宣布裁减职工七千人。（附图片）
