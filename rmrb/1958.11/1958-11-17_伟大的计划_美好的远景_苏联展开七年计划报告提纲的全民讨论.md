Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 16th: The Soviet people throughout the country have begun a broad and in-depth discussion of Khrushchev's draft outline for the Seven-Year Plan report, and a great nationwide political upsurge has taken shape. Party propagandists are going deep into grassroots units to carry out propaganda work. The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol have each made decisions calling on workers and youth to conduct in-depth study and discussion of Khrushchev's draft report and to further launch socialist labor competitions.

The Moscow newspapers on the 16th began to publish the opinions of many famous scholars and ordinary working people participating in the discussion of the Seven-Year Plan outline. Soviet metallurgist and academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Bardin, published an article in the newspaper, introducing in detail the situation of the Soviet Union's third iron and steel base, which plays a major role in the development of the metallurgical industry during the Seven-Year Plan. He said that after the completion of the third iron and steel base, it is planned to produce 15 million to 20 million tons of pig iron, but according to local mineral resources and production conditions, it can be increased to 50 million to 60 million tons. He believes that the third iron and steel base can be built in a shorter period.

Mukhamedgaliev, President of the Kazakh Academy of Agricultural Sciences, raised the issue of improving the fertility of newly reclaimed wasteland. He suggested establishing a reasonable crop rotation system, establishing protective forest belts in Kazakhstan, adopting close planting by variety selection, and studying the fertilization of reclaimed land.

Mustafayev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party, talked about the distribution of new industrial centers. He suggested decentralizing the construction of industrial enterprises and establishing some new towns around them.

Semyoninsky, a worker at the Kiev Red Excavator Factory, pointed out in his article that in order to complete the new and huge tasks, it is necessary to further improve labor productivity and fully realize a high degree of automation and mechanization of production.

The nationwide discussion of the Seven-Year Plan outline is being carried out in depth, and this discussion is also being widely carried out in the Soviet army.
Xinhua News Agency, November 16th: According to a TASS report from Moscow on the 15th: The Soviet people unanimously support Khrushchev's recent draft report on "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1959-1965." The Soviet working people have held various gatherings across the country, expressing their determination to work hard to realize this great plan.

Grigorenko, a steel rolling worker at the Moscow "Sickle and Hammer Steel Factory," said at the meeting: "The draft outline of the Seven-Year Plan reflects the vital interests and deepest aspirations of our country's working people. The Party's plan is the will of the entire people."

Krasnikov, an engineer at the Kirov Machine Building Factory in Leningrad, said at the factory-wide staff meeting that the figures listed in the outline are very encouraging. These figures illustrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and demonstrate that communism is already the approaching future of our motherland.

Tursunkulov, a famous Uzbek cotton planting expert, said when discussing the outline that the future of the Soviet people is wonderful. As soon as you read this great document, a magnificent picture of building communism will appear before your eyes.

Latvian workers are enthusiastically supporting the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan. Anna Straupe, a worker at the VEF electrical factory in Riga, said, "When you read Comrade Khrushchev's draft report, your heart is filled with pride. We must complete the plan formulated by the Party."

Kazadaev, a lathe operator at the Bolida Power Machinery Factory, said at the factory staff meeting: "This outline makes us believe how our dear Party has always unswervingly implemented the policy of continuously improving the material well-being and cultural life of the people."
