Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The “Beijing-Moscow Printmakers Joint Exhibition” opened today at the Art Exhibition Hall on Shuaifu Yuan, Beijing.

　　Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Culture and Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, pointed out in his opening remarks that holding this exhibition on the great occasion of the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution has even more important significance. He said: Lu Xun, in evaluating Soviet print art, once said, "I think, without the October Revolution, these works would not only not be able to meet us, but might not even appear." Lu Xun's words profoundly clarified that the great October Socialist Revolution is the source of great revolutionary art, and at the same time created the prerequisite for the infinite development of the friendship and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Soviet people.

　　Soviet Embassy in China Counselor Sudarikov also spoke at the opening ceremony. He pointed out: The two shining names of "Beijing-Moscow" symbolize the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and the opening of the "Beijing-Moscow Printmakers Joint Exhibition" marks the further consolidation and development of the deep friendship and cultural cooperation between the two peoples.

　　Wu Zuoren, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association, introduced the different artistic styles of the printmakers of the two countries at the opening ceremony, and pointed out that this exhibition will enable Chinese printmakers to have the opportunity to directly learn from the advanced Soviet print art.

    “北京——莫斯科版画家作品联合展览会”开幕
    据新华社7日讯　“北京——莫斯科版画家作品联合展览会”今天在北京帅府园美术展览馆开幕。
    文化部副部长、中苏友好协会总会秘书长钱俊瑞在开幕词中指出：在十月革命四十一周年这个伟大的节日举行这个展览会，有着更为重要的意义。他说：鲁迅在评价苏联的版画艺术作品时曾经说过：“我想，倘没有十月革命，这些作品是不但不能和我们见面，也未必会得出现的。”鲁迅的这几句话，深刻地阐明了伟大的十月社会主义革命是产生伟大的革命艺术作品的泉源，同时又为中苏两国人民的友谊和文化交流得以无限发展创造了前提。
    苏联驻华大使馆参赞苏达利柯夫也在开幕式上讲了话。他指出：“北京——莫斯科”这两个光辉的名字，象征着中苏两国人民的团结和友谊，而“北京——莫斯科版画家作品联合展览会”的开幕，正是标志着中苏两国人民深厚友谊和文化合作的进一步巩固和发展。
    中国美术家协会副主席吴作人在开幕式上介绍了两国版画家们的不同艺术风格，并指出这个展览会将使我国版画家们得到直接学习苏联先进版画艺术的机会。
