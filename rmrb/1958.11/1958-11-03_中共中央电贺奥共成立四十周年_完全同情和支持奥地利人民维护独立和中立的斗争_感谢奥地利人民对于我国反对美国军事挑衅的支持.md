Xinhua News Agency, 2nd November. The 40th anniversary of the founding of the Austrian Communist Party is on November 3rd. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has sent a cable to the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party expressing warm congratulations. The full text of the congratulatory message is as follows:
To the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party, dear comrades:

	On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Austrian Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends, on behalf of all party members and the entire Chinese people, warm fraternal congratulations to you and, through you, to all members of the Austrian Communist Party and the Austrian working people.

	Since its establishment, the Austrian Communist Party has been waging an unremitting struggle for the liberation of the Austrian working class and working people under extremely difficult conditions. Before and during the Second World War, the Austrian Communist Party made significant contributions to the heroic struggle of the Austrian people to free themselves from the bloody rule of fascism. In the post-war years, the Austrian Communist Party made tremendous efforts in the struggle of the Austrian people to sign a treaty aimed at safeguarding world peace and guaranteeing Austria's independence. Now, the Austrian Communist Party is making every effort to unite all patriotic and democratic forces in Austria and is waging a fruitful struggle to defend Austria's independence and neutrality and to strive for peace in Europe and the world. All this shows that the Austrian Communist Party is indeed a long-tested representative and defender of the interests of the Austrian people.

	Austria is located in the center of Europe and borders the European countries of the socialist camp. Its independence and neutrality are a blow to the imperialist policy of aggression and war. Our people fully sympathize with and support the Austrian people's struggle to safeguard the independence and neutrality of their country. Our people also thank the Austrian people for their sympathy and support for our country's ongoing struggle against American imperialist military provocations and threats of war. American imperialism is now the most ferocious enemy of world peace and the independence of all countries. It is stepping up its policy of aggression and war, constantly creating international tension, and subjecting mankind to the threat of wars of aggression. All peace-loving forces in the world must maintain a high degree of vigilance against American imperialism and wage the struggle to win and consolidate world peace with a hundredfold confidence and effort.

	We wish the Austrian Communist Party, which is loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and resolutely opposes modern revisionism, new achievements in strengthening party unity, strengthening close ties with the workers and peasants, and winning the broad unity of all patriotic and democratic forces in Austria; new victories in the struggle to safeguard Austria's independence and neutrality, defend European and world peace; and new progress in strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Austrian peoples and promoting friendly relations between the two countries.

    中共中央电贺奥共成立四十周年

    感谢奥地利人民对于我国反对美国军事挑衅的支持
    新华社2日讯　11月3日是奥地利共产党成立四十周年。中国共产党中央委员会已经致电奥地利共产党中央委员会表示热烈祝贺。贺电全文如下：奥地利共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    欣逢奥地利共产党成立四十周年纪念日，中国共产党中央委员会谨代表全体党员和全中国人民，向你们并通过你们，向奥地利共产党全体党员和奥地利劳动人民致以热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    奥地利共产党自从成立以来就在极其困难的条件下为奥地利工人阶级和劳动人民的解放事业进行着坚持不渝的斗争。在第二次世界大战以前和大战期间，奥地利共产党在奥地利人民为摆脱法西斯的血腥统治而进行的英勇斗争中作出了重大的贡献。在战后的年代里，奥地利共产党又在奥地利人民争取签订旨在维护世界和平和保障奥地利独立的和约的斗争中作了巨大的努力。现在，奥地利共产党正在竭力团结奥地利一切爱国民主力量，为着保卫奥地利的独立和中立，争取欧洲和世界的和平而进行着卓有成效的斗争。这一切表明，奥地利共产党不愧是奥地利人民利益的久经考验的代表者和捍卫者。
    奥地利地处欧洲的中心，又同社会主义阵营的欧洲国家接壤，它的独立和中立是对于帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的打击。我国人民完全同情和支持奥地利人民为维护他们国家的独立和中立而进行的斗争。我国人民也感谢奥地利人民对于我国正在进行的反对美帝国主义军事挑衅和战争威胁的斗争的同情和支持。美帝国主义现在是世界和平和各国独立的最凶恶的敌人。它正在加紧推行侵略政策和战争政策，不断制造国际紧张局势，使人类遭到侵略战争的威胁。全世界一切爱好和平的力量必须对美帝国主义保持高度的警惕，而又以百倍的信心和努力进行争取和巩固世界和平的斗争。
    我们祝忠实于马克思列宁主义原则、坚决反对现代修正主义的奥地利共产党，在增强党的团结、加强同工农群众的密切联系、争取奥地利一切爱国民主力量的广泛团结的工作中取得新的成就，在维护奥地利的独立和中立、保卫欧洲和世界和平的斗争中取得新的胜利，在加强中奥两国人民的友谊和促进两国友好关系的努力中取得新的进展。
　　中国共产党中央委员会
