    High Yield and High Quality
    During the nationwide steel battle in October, the more than six million steelworkers in Henan Province achieved brilliant results continuously. On October 15th, they completed the province's entire monthly steel production plan; on October 23rd, they also completed the province's entire monthly pig iron production plan. From the 29th to the 31st, they achieved especially high yields for three consecutive days, with an average daily output of about one million tons. This is a great achievement for the people of Henan and an inspiring victory song on China's steel front.
    This refutes the "autumn reckoning faction's" argument that "high yield has a certain limit." When the "autumn reckoning faction" saw that Henan's daily output of pig iron was 100,000 tons and daily output of steel was 10,000 tons, they issued arguments such as "high yield cannot last" and "high yield has reached its peak." However, in a short period of time, the actual steel production performance of the people of Henan has not only not remained at the level of 100,000 tons of pig iron and 10,000 tons of steel per day, but has also been riding the wind and waves, advancing bravely, with the daily output of pig iron suddenly increasing by 400,000 tons on October 25th, and now breaking the record of one million tons of iron per day! This is a miracle that those who believe production has reached its peak cannot imagine.
    The problem now is to go further, to improve the output and quality of pig iron to an ideal level. The key to the decision lies in whether there is a concept and will of high yield and high quality. It must be pointed out that more than one-third of Henan's pig iron is first-class iron, and two-thirds is second-class iron (this iron can be directly used for steelmaking). If we further mobilize the masses to eliminate sintered iron and reduce the proportion of second-class iron, then we can increase pig iron production even more and provide more "grain" to key steel enterprises across the country.
    We wish the national steel army new achievements of high yield and high quality in November.

### 高产又高质

    高产又高质
    在全国10月份钢铁大战中，河南省六百多万钢铁大军，连续获得了辉煌的战果。10月15日，他们完成了全省全月钢的生产计划；23日，又完成了全省全月生铁的生产计划。从29日到31日又连续三天特别高产，每天日产量平均在一百万吨左右，这是河南人民的巨大成就，是我国钢铁战线上激动人心的凯歌。
    这就驳倒了“秋后算账派”认为“高产有一定限度”的论点。“秋后算账派”在看到河南日产生铁十万吨、日产钢一万吨的时候，曾经发出了“高产不能持久”、“高产到了顶”等等论调。但是，曾几何时，河南人民的钢铁生产实绩不仅没有停留在日产铁十万吨、日产钢一万吨的水平上，而是乘风破浪，奋勇前进，在10月25日生铁的日产量突然增加了四十万吨，现在又突破日产铁百万吨的纪录！这是生产到顶论者所不能想像的奇迹。
    现在的问题是，要百尺竿头更进一步，把生铁产量和质量提高到理想的水平。决定的关键在于有没有高产高质的观念和意志。必须指出：河南的生铁有三分之一以上是一类铁，有三分之二是二类铁（这些铁都可以直接用来炼钢）。如果进一步地发动群众消灭烧结铁、缩小二类铁的比例，那末，我们就可以更多地增加生铁生产，可以提供全国重点钢铁企业更多的粮食。
    预祝全国钢铁大军在11月份创造高产又高质的新成就。
