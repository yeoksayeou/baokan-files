Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 16th (TASS): The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, in an outline on reforming the education system, suggested that a gradual transition to eight-year compulsory education be implemented starting from the 1959-1960 academic year, to be completed in four to five years. The reorganization of most institutions of higher education will begin in 1959 and be completed in three to five years.

This outline, entitled "On Strengthening the Connection Between Schools and Life and Further Developing the National Education System," was approved by the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party held on November 12th and was published on the 16th for nationwide discussion. This issue of education reform will be submitted to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for discussion.

The outline points out that in the first stage of secondary education, eight-year compulsory education will be implemented to replace the original seven-year system. All young people graduating from eight-year schools must participate in public welfare labor. "This will create more equal conditions for all citizens in labor and education."

In the second stage, young people will receive complete secondary education in schools for working and peasant youth, general secondary polytechnic schools, and technical secondary schools.

The outline points out that the significance of this reorganization of secondary schools lies in: "It can cultivate well-rounded individuals who are knowledgeable in the basic sciences and have the ability to work regularly."

The outline stipulates the preservation of schools that cultivate children with special talents in music, dance, and visual arts; it also stipulates the establishment of specialized schools to cultivate young people who have special interests and talents in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.

The outline puts forward a task: all workers and collective farmers must possess a secondary education level, which is one of the important conditions for the smooth construction of communism.

The outline also plans to reorganize vocational education and improve the secondary vocational education system.

The existing factory schools, craft schools, railway schools, and other schools will be reorganized into urban day and night vocational technical schools, with study periods ranging from one to three years; rural vocational schools, with study periods ranging from one to two years. They will train skilled workers, machine operators, construction personnel, and other agricultural workers for various sectors of production.

The outline points out that institutions of higher education should be close to life, close to production, and maintain close ties with them, while at the same time improving the theoretical level of students based on the latest scientific achievements.

The outline suggests prioritizing the admission of young people with practical work experience into institutions of higher education. In the development of institutions of higher education, priority should be given to the development of night schools and correspondence schools.

In the process of further developing science and technology, experts with higher education must acquire new knowledge. Therefore, institutions of higher education face a task: to ensure the continuous improvement of the professional skills of these experts without disrupting their work.

The outline points out that special attention should be paid to cultivating engineering personnel needed for new technology sectors and further developing engineering personnel needed for scientific design work. Due to the rapid development of science and technology, the task arises of cultivating new types of experts who combine technical knowledge with profound theoretical literacy.

In the coming years, the training of the following engineers will be widely developed in the Soviet Union: engineers in peaceful utilization of atomic energy, automation and telemechanics, electronics, electrical machinery manufacturing and instrumentation, radio engineering and communications, chemical engineering, and other fields.

The education of agricultural institutions of higher education should be organized on the basis of large state farms. These schools should become scientific centers and help agriculture improve production.

University education will be further developed. The training of experts in computational mathematics, biophysics, biochemistry, nuclear physics, and radiophysics will be vigorously developed.

The outline emphasizes that students in institutions of higher education play a significant role in studying social sciences. A basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism is essential for experts in all fields.

The outline emphasizes that the reorganization of secondary schools and institutions of higher education is of great significance for the further material and spiritual development of Soviet society. The close connection between schools and life will create the necessary conditions to better cultivate the growing generation that will live and work under the communist system.

    苏共中央和政府公布改革教育提纲
    加强学校同生活联系发展全国国民教育
    八年制学校毕业的青年都要参加公益劳动
    三年到五年内完成大部分高等学校的改组
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏共中央和苏联部长会议在一个关于改革教育制度的提纲中建议，从1959—1960学年开始逐步过渡到八年制义务教育，在四、五年内完成这种过渡。大部分高等学校的改组将从1959年开始，在三年到五年内完成。
    这个题名为“关于加强学校同生活的联系和进一步发展全国国民教育制度”的提纲，已经由11月12日举行的苏共中央全会批准，并且在16日公布，以供全民讨论。这个关于教育改革的问题将提交苏联最高苏维埃讨论。
    提纲中指出，在中等教育的第一阶段，实施八年制义务教育，以代替原来的七年制。从八年制学校毕业的全体青年都要参加公益劳动。“这样就将为全体公民在劳动中和教育中造成更加平等的条件。”
    在第二阶段，青年将在工农青年学校、一般中等综合技术学校和技术专科中学获得完全的中等教育。
    提纲指出，中等学校的这种改组的意义在于：“它可以培养全面发展的、通晓科学基础知识的、并具有经常劳动能力的人。”
    提纲中规定，保存培养在音乐、舞蹈和造型艺术方面有特殊才能的儿童的学校；还规定设立专门的学校来培养那些对数学、物理、化学、生物有特殊爱好和才能的青年。
    提纲中提出一项任务：全体工人和集体农民都要具备中等教育的水平，这是顺利建设共产主义的重要条件之一。
    提纲中还计划改组职业教育和改善中等专业教育制度。
    现有的工厂学校、工艺学校、铁路学校和其他学校将分别改组为城市的日间和夜间专业职业技术学校，学习期限从一年到三年；农村的职业学校，学习期限从一年到二年。它们将培养生产各部门的熟练工人、机器操使者、建筑人员和其他农业工作人员。
    提纲指出，高等学校应当接近生活，接近生产，同它们保持认真的联系，同时必须根据最新科学成就提高学生们的理论水平。
    提纲建议，首先接受那些有实际工作经验的青年进入高等学校。在发展高等学校方面，首先发展夜校和函授学校。
    在进一步发展科学技术的过程中，具备高等教育的专家必须获得新的知识，因此高等学校面临着一项任务：保证不脱产地提高这些专家的业务水平。
    提纲指出，要特别注意培养新技术部门所需要的工程人员，进一步发展科学设计工作所需要的工程人员。由于科学技术突飞猛进的发展，就产生这样的任务：培养新型的、把技术知识同深刻的理论素养结合起来的专家。
    在今后一些年里培养下列工程师的工作将在苏联获得广泛的发展：和平利用原子能、自动学和遥控力学、电子学、电力机器制造和仪器制造、无线电工程和通讯、化学工程等方面的工程人员。
    农业高等学校的教育应当在大国营农场的基础上组织。这些学校应成为科学中心并帮助农业提高生产。
    大学教育将获得进一步的发展。计算数学、生物物理学、生物化学、核物理学、无线电物理学等方面的专家培养工作将大力发展。
    提纲中强调指出，高等学校学生研究社会科学有重大作用。马克思列宁主义的基础知识是一切部门的专家所必需的。
    提纲着重指出，中等学校和高等学校的改组对于苏维埃社会在物质上和精神上的进一步发展具有重大的意义。学校和生活接近，将建立必要的条件更好地培养将在共产主义制度下生活和劳动的正在成长的一代。
