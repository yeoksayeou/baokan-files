    The "Forward Position Ten Sisters"
    Ye Feng
    The shells made the earth tremble. The eldest sister, He Huiqin, thought, "After the shelling, the soldiers must be hungry!" She made a suggestion: "Let's cook some sweet potato soup for the soldiers!" Everyone applauded in agreement, and they all ran out of the bomb shelter. He Huiqin took a basket from the kitchen and went out to fetch sweet potatoes with the sixth sister, He Suhua. After the sweet potatoes were brought back, the kitchen immediately became lively. One started the fire, another washed the pot, and a third cut the sweet potatoes. In the blink of an eye, all the work was done. As soon as the shelling stopped and others came out of the bomb shelter to boil water, they had already carried the steaming sweet potato soup to the front line. The soldiers never accepted these gifts; whoever brought them would be asked to take them back. But they had no way of dealing with these girls. The girls would put the sweet potato soup on the front line and run away before the soldiers could say anything.
    The soldiers were very "flustered" when the girls came. They were busy stuffing their dirty clothes into pillows and shoving them under the bedding, or racking their brains to put them in empty shell boxes. Although the soldiers thought they had hidden them well, the dirty clothes were still "searched" out after the girls took a walk around. Some soldiers would immediately go to the well to wash their clothes after changing them, but the girls wouldn't let them get away with it. They adopted the "sudden attack" method of guerrilla warfare, swarming to the well. Before the soldiers could figure out what was happening, the clothes in their hands had already been snatched away. The girls were very enthusiastic about washing clothes for the soldiers. In the beginning, there were some minor disagreements among them. Some were happy to wash a lot, while others always felt unhappy if they washed less. The girls held a meeting themselves, divided the "battlefield," specifying who was responsible for washing the clothes of the First Artillery Company soldiers, and who was responsible for washing the clothes of the Second Artillery Company soldiers... After clear regulations were made, the soldiers' clothes were all "registered," and there were no more complaints.
    The girls also moved shells and carried stones like the men. As soon as they approached the ammunition truck, they would move shells. If one person couldn't carry a box, two people would carry it together. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, ammunition trucks would rumble into the village entrance, and they would wake up. One person would call out, and ten people would come out. Everyone rubbed their eyes and ran to carry ammunition.
    The girls' production work was raising pigs. After the elderly women evacuated to the rear during the artillery battle, the ten of them took over the feeding work that had been done by thirty people. They got up early and worked late, chopping and cooking feed for the pigs, and they continued to work as usual during the artillery battles. Each of them was so innocent and carefree. Sixteen-year-old He Xuezhen was like a spring oriole, raising her melodious voice to sing whenever she had time. As soon as she started to sing, the other nine voices would join in. Shells exploded outside the bomb shelter, but they sang in the bomb shelter, while still mending clothes for the soldiers.
    If you ask for the names of these ten sisters, they are the eldest sister He Huiqin, the second sister He Caizhi, the third sister He Qiongyin, the fourth sister He Xuezhen, the fifth sister He Xuehua, the sixth sister He Suhua, the seventh sister He Gangchi, the eighth sister He Gangyao, the ninth sister Zhang Xianjin, and the tenth sister He Jinzhen.

    前沿十姐妹
    叶峰
    炮弹打得大地都在发抖。大姐何惠琴想：“打完炮，战士们一定饿了！”她提了一个建议：“我们给战士们煮些地瓜汤吧！”大家鼓掌同意；纷纷从防炮洞里跑出来。何惠琴从厨房中拿了篮子，和六姐何素华一起奔出去取地瓜了。地瓜取回来，厨房里顿时热闹起来，这个生火、那个洗锅，第三个切地瓜，七手八脚的转眼间把什么工作都做好了。等炮声一停，别人从防炮洞里出来煮开水，她们已挑了热腾腾的地瓜汤上阵地去了。战士们对这些礼物从来都不接受的，谁拿来，就叫谁带回去。可是他们对这些姑娘却没有办法。姑娘们把地瓜汤在阵地上一放，没等战士开口，她们就跑得没个影儿了。
    姑娘们一来，战士们都很“慌张”。他们忙着把换下来的脏衣服装进枕头里，塞到褥底下，有的挖空心思放在空炮弹箱里。尽管战士们以为藏得很好了，但是姑娘们在那里走一圈，脏衣服还是照样被“搜查”出来。有的战士换下衣服，马上到井边去洗，姑娘们也不放过。她们采用打游击的“突然袭击”的办法，一窝蜂似的拥到水井边，战士还没有弄清发生了什么事，手中的衣服早就被抢走了。姑娘们给战士洗衣服，积极性很高。在当初，她们中间也发生过一些小意见。有的人洗得多，感到很高兴；有的人洗得少，心里老感到不快活。姑娘们自己开了会，划分阵地，谁包洗一炮战士的衣服，谁包洗二炮战士的衣服，……作了明确规定。这样，战士的衣服都挂了号，意见都没有了。
    姑娘们也同男人们一样搬炮弹、运石块，她们一走近弹药车，就搬炮弹。一人扛不动，就两人抬一箱。有时深更半夜，村口轰隆轰隆驶来了弹药车，她们都会惊醒过来。一人呼唤，十人出动，大家揉揉眼皮，奔去搬运炮弹。
    姑娘们的生产工作是喂猪。炮战以后，年老的妇女疏散去后沿，三十人做的饲养工作由她们十人担负起来。她们起早摸黑为猪切煮饲料，在炮战的时候也照常工作。她们各个是那么天真烂漫，表现得无忧无虑。十六岁的何雪珍像春天的黄莺，一有空就提高婉转的嗓子唱歌。只要她一领唱，九张嗓子都应和上去。炮弹在防炮洞外爆炸，她们在防炮洞里唱歌。手里还不停地给战士补衣服。
    若问这十姐妹的名字，她们就是大姐何惠琴、二姐何菜治、三姐何琼吟、四姐何雪珍、五姐何雪花、六姐何素华、七姐何纲池、八姐何纲腰、九姐张仙锦、十妹何金针。
