(Reported from Xi'an) The red flag of running factories on a large scale has been planted in Shaanxi provincial-level agencies. From August to mid-October, provincial-level agencies have established more than 360 factories in 120 types of fields, including steelmaking, chemical industry, agricultural tool manufacturing, bacterial fertilizer, electrical equipment, and machinery repair. All have been put into production. On average, each agency has established four factories, basically realizing that all agencies, large and small, have factories, and cadres are also workers.

Shaanxi provincial-level agencies resolutely implemented the mass line in running factories, using indigenous methods instead of foreign ones, making do with whatever was available, and adhering to the principle of "doing what is needed, establishing what is needed." At the beginning, some "onlookers" believed that it was difficult to run factories because there were no technicians, no factory buildings, and no machines, and after the staffing cuts, there were no people or time. Therefore, it was difficult to run factories. Various agencies launched a tit-for-tat debate against this "conditionalism" and mobilized everyone to come up with ideas, tap human and material resources, and run factories on a large scale. For example, after the debate, the General Affairs Section of the Provincial Public Security Bureau took the lead in establishing a machinery repair factory. The factory building was a shed that was originally used to store bicycles, and the tools were picked out from the scrap heap. They formulated factory production plans and management regulations, and in a few days of spare time, they overhauled a car and more than 30 bicycles. The leaders of the bureau seized this typical example and immediately organized all cadres to visit this factory that started from scratch. After discussion, everyone proposed: if the General Affairs Section can do it, so can we, and we must build a steelmaking furnace. If they didn't know how to make steel, they sent people to a hardware factory to learn; if there was no factory building, the steel furnace was built under a large tree; the equipment was also solved through self-reliance. From preparation to steel output, it only took more than five days. In more than a month, the entire bureau built twelve factories. The Provincial Broadcasting Station and the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration, adhering to the principle of doing what they did and setting up what kind of factory, started working together. In a few days, they established a radio and recorder repair factory and a factory for producing telecommunications equipment. One workshop in the factory run by the radio station processes nearly a thousand loudspeakers every day. After careful research, they also successfully trial-produced the first portable recorder in the Northwest.

After the agencies set up factories, cadres became workers, and many people's labor perspectives were strengthened; after work, fewer people strolled the streets and played poker, and more people studied and researched production technology. Business knowledge and work efficiency have been generally improved. The nine small factories of the Department of General Merchandise and Medicine of the Provincial Department of Commerce produce nearly 100 kinds of products, including ink, batteries, kerosene lamp mantles, and cultural and medical supplies. They have become both business personnel and producers. Many people have learned the technology of making two or three kinds of commodities in the factory. In the ten days after the factory was built, there were more than 50 innovations and creations. Some old cadres of the Cultural School of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, because they participated in the production of bacterial fertilizers and sand casting, found it easier to understand physics and chemistry, which they had previously found a headache. Some administrative cadres of agencies, after participating in factory production, also solved the problems of not being familiar with the business and not being concerned about business technology. Some leaders of the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau said that in the past, when the lower levels asked for technical advice, they felt very embarrassed, but now this contradiction has been basically resolved. Therefore, many cadres call the factory the "Red and Expert School."

Due to common labor, the relationship between leaders and those led, and between cadres, has also become closer. In the past, the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau had organized dances and paid for movie tickets in order to strengthen the relationship between comrades, but it did not achieve the expected results even after spending a lot of effort. Now, an unprecedented atmosphere of unity and mutual assistance has emerged in the comradeship of the agency. When producing in the factory, the strong help the weak; those with technology help those who have not mastered the technology. People interact more often and talk more about production and ideas. The previous situation of "each returning to their own home" after work and rarely interacting with each other has changed. The "superior" and "inferior" concepts that used to exist between doctors, nurses, and handyman in Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital have also been greatly overcome, and they have changed from not paying much attention to each other to respecting and yielding to each other.

    陕西大小机关都办工厂
    干部增强了劳动观点　上下级关系更加亲密
    本报西安电　陕西省级机关已插上大办工厂的红旗，自8月间至10月中旬省级机关已办起炼钢，化工、农具制造、细菌肥料、电机器材、机械修配等一百二十多种共三百六十多个工厂。并已全部投入生产，每个机关平均办起四个工厂，基本实现了大小机关都办有工厂，干部又是工人。
    陕西省级机关在办工厂中坚决贯彻群众路线，以土代洋，因陋就简和本着“做什么，办什么”的原则，来进行的。开始，有些“观潮派”认为没有技术人员，没有厂房和机器，紧缩编制后没有人和时间。因此很难办工厂。各机关对这种“条件论”展开了针锋相对的辩论，并发动大家出主意，挖掘人力物力，大办工厂。如省公安厅总务科在辩论后，一马当先办起了机械修配厂，厂房是利用原来放自行车的草棚，工具是由破烂堆里拣出来的，他们制订了工厂生产计划和管理规章，在几天中忙中抽闲就大修了一辆汽车和三十多辆自行车。该厅的领导人员抓住这一典型立即组织全厅干部参观了这个白手起家的厂子，经过讨论后，大家提出：总务科能干我们也能干，一定要把炼钢炉建起来。不会炼钢，他们就派人到一个五金厂去学习；没有厂房，钢炉就建在一棵大树下；设备也是靠自力更生解决的。从筹建到出钢只用了五天多时间，全厅一个多月就建起十二个工厂。省广播电台和省邮电管理局本着做什么工作，办什么样的工厂的原则，全体人员都动手，几天中就办起了一个收音机、录音机修造厂和生产电讯器材的工厂，电台办的工厂的一个车间每天加工喇叭近一千只，他们经过精心研究还试制成功了西北第一部手提录音机。
    机关办起工厂后，干部成为工人，许多人的劳动观点增强了；下班后，蹓大街打扑克的人少了，学习和钻研生产技术的人多了。并普遍地提高了业务知识和工作效率。省商业厅百货医药业务处的九个小型工厂产品有油墨、电池、汽灯纱罩和文化、医药用具等近一百种。变成了是商业人员，又是生产者。许多人在工厂中学会了自制两三种商品的技术，建起工厂后的十多天中，就有五十多件革新和创制品。中共陕西省委文化学校一些老干部由于参加了细菌肥料和翻砂的生产，原来对那些感到伤脑筋的物理、化学也觉得容易理解了。有些机关行政干部参加工厂生产后，原来不太熟悉业务和不大关心业务技术的问题也随之解决了。省邮电局一些领导人员说，过去下边请示技术问题，自己感到很为难，现在这个矛盾基本解决了。因此，许多干部称工厂是“红专学校”。
    由于共同劳动，领导与被领导，干部之间的关系也亲密了。省邮电局过去为了密切同志间的关系，曾组织舞会和包看电影，费了很大的事也未达到预期效果。现在这个机关同志关系出现了前所未有团结互助的气象。到工厂生产时，强的帮助弱的；有技术的帮助没有掌握技术的人。大家往来关系和谈生产谈思想的时候多了。以前那种一下班“各回各家”相互很少往来的情况得到了改变。陕西省人民医院大夫、护士和勤杂人员之间过去存在那种“尊”，“劣”观念，也得到了很大克服，由相互不大理睬变成了相敬相让。　（张国宁）
