    Sanmenxia Poetry Collection
    It Flows How We Tell It To
    The Yellow River rolls eastward,
    In the past, Yu the Great was worried;
    Workers are now masters of the house,
    It flows how we tell it to.
    Great Battle of the Divine Gate River
    The working people's wisdom is high,
    Conquering the Yellow River is today.
    With one heart, a great battle at the Divine Gate River,
    We must make the Yellow River change its course.
    Competing with the Yellow River for Supremacy
    Heroic people have great ambition,
    Competing with the Yellow River for supremacy.
    Cutting off the Yellow River's rolling waters,
    Shaving off the evil dragon's scales and claws.
          (Compiled and selected by Jun Qian)

    三门峡诗抄
    叫它咋流它咋流
    黄河滚滚向东流，
    昔日大禹曾发愁；
    工人当家做了主，
    叫它咋流它咋流。
    大战神门河
    劳动人民智慧高，
    征服黄河在今朝。
    齐心大战神门河，
    要叫黄河改改道。
    要与黄河争上下
    英雄人民气魄大，
    要与黄河争上下。
    切断黄河滚滚水，
    削去恶龙鳞爪牙。
          （君谦编选）
