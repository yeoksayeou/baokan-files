People of All Ethnic Groups Sing Together

    A silver river descends from the sky,
    Molten steel flows, reflecting red light,
    Laojun destroyed his Bagua furnace,
    To learn steelmaking from the farmers.
            (Liu Baohou)
    This year's crops are truly strong,
    Delighting eighty-year-old grandmothers,
    The grandfather says they are bamboo shoots,
    The grandmother says they are forest slopes.
      (Yi ethnic group Long Yunzhong sings)
    Groups of big mountains surround a small mountain,
    We want to move the groups of mountains,
    Move the small mountain to build roads,
    Move the big mountains to create fertile land.
      (Miao ethnic group He Yaoping)
    The sun rises, turning the land red,
    Flowers bloom in a large cluster;
    Chairman Mao is like the red sun,
    The people of all ethnic groups are like a cluster of flowers.
    Everyone sings the praises of Chairman Mao,
    Flowers face the sun, each one red.
      (Buyi ethnic group Yang Guangfen)

    各族人民齐歌唱
    一条银河从天降，
    钢水奔流映红光，
    老君毁掉八卦炉，
    投拜农民学炼钢。
            （刘保厚）
    今年庄稼真不弱，
    喜煞八十老公婆，
    公公说是竹笋子，
    婆婆说是森林坡。
      （彝族龙云中唱）
    群群大山围小山，
    我们要把群山搬，
    搬开小山修公路，
    搬开大山成良田。
      （苗族何要平）
    太阳出来遍地红，
    鲜花开出一大蓬；
    毛主席好比红太阳，
    各族人民好比花一蓬。
    人人歌唱毛主席，
    鲜花向阳朵朵红。
      （布依族杨光芬）
