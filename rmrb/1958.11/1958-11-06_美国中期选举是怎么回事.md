What is the US Midterm Election?

    The US congressional and local elections held on November 4th are to re-elect all members of the House of Representatives, one-third of the senators, the governors of thirty-two states, and state legislators in dozens of states. This election is held in the middle of the president's term, so it is generally called the midterm election.

    Presidential Election and Congressional Election
    The US Congress includes the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate has ninety-six members, with two members elected from each state, serving a six-year term, with one-third re-elected every two years; the House of Representatives has four hundred and thirty-five members, serving a two-year term, elected by each state according to population proportion. However, the number of governors and state legislators re-elected each time varies because the terms of governors and state legislators vary from state to state. The US Congress is the highest legislative body. The Senate and the House of Representatives enjoy equal legislative power. A legislative bill is only considered passed when both houses agree. However, the Senate has special powers such as approving international treaties signed by the President and approving the President's appointments of government members. In the American bourgeois political life, the most important is the presidential election, because the president is the highest administrative head. The president is not responsible to the Congress, and the Congress cannot force the president to resign with a vote of no confidence. The president can also veto bills passed by the Congress. Only when the Congress reviews the bill again and passes it again with a two-thirds majority in both houses, can the bill take effect even after the president's veto. However, the re-election of Congress, governors, and state legislators still has a certain impact on the presidential election.

    Republican Party Plummets
    During Eisenhower's tenure as president (two consecutive terms), there have been a total of four congressional, gubernatorial, and state legislator re-elections, including this one. In the congressional election at the end of 1952, when Eisenhower was elected president, the Republican Party held a majority of seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, with forty-nine senators and two hundred and nineteen representatives. In the congressional election at the end of 1954, the Democratic Party held a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, with forty-nine senators and two hundred and thirty-two representatives. After the re-election in 1956, the Democratic Party still held a majority in both houses, but the change in seats was not significant. That year, Eisenhower was still elected president for a second term. But the result of this midterm election is very different. The Republican Party suffered a heavy defeat, and its seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives plummeted.

    How should we view such election results? Of course, whether it is the US presidential election or the congressional re-election, it is a hypocritical "democratic" election manipulated by large monopoly capital groups; but it also reflects, to a certain extent, the unpopularity of the US government's policies.

    Undemocratic Elections
    The US election system is undemocratic, making it difficult for progressive parties to obtain legitimate campaign status, and also subjecting citizens' right to vote to various restrictions or deprivation. According to the regulations of various states, there are as many as fifty kinds of restrictions on the voting rights of working people and blacks, the most common of which are property, education, and residence restrictions, which deprive millions of working people of their voting rights, and the voting rights of most blacks. In this congressional and local election, according to US government statistics, there are a total of 105 million eligible citizens of voting age in the United States, but only more than 75 million have registered to participate in the election, and it is estimated that only more than 40 million actually voted. This is because American voters are becoming increasingly uninterested in the Republican and Democratic parties' monopolized campaigns.

### 美国中期选举是怎么回事

    美国中期选举是怎么回事
    美国11月4日举行的国会和地方选举，是改选全部众议员、三分之一的参议员、三十二个州的州长和几十个州的州议会议员的选举。这次选举是在总统任期的中间举行的，所以，一般又叫中期选举。
    总统选举和国会选举
    美国国会包括参、众两院，参议院有议员九十六名，每州选举两名，任期六年，每两年改选三分之一；众议院有议员四百三十五名，任期两年，各州按人口比例选出。但州长和州议会每次改选的数目不等，因为各州州长和州议员的任期各州不一致。美国国会是最高立法机关，参、众两院享有平等的立法权，立法草案只有在两院都同意的情况下才算是通过，但参议院具有批准总统签订的国际条约和通过总统对政府成员的任命等特殊权力。在美国资产阶级政治生活中，最重要的是总统选举，因为总统是最高行政首长，总统不对国会负责，国会不能以不信任逼总统辞职，总统还可以否决国会通过的法案，只有当国会对法案再作审查，并由两院以三分之二以上大多数再次通过时，该法案虽经总统否决仍能生效。但国会以及州长和州议会的改选，对总统选举仍有一定的影响。
    共和党一落千丈
    在艾森豪威尔担任总统（连任）期间，国会、州长和州议员的改选，连这次共有四次。在1952年底艾森豪威尔当选总统时的议会选举结果，共和党在参众两院中都占多数议席，计参议员四十九席，众议员二百一十九席。在1954年底的议会选举中，民主党在参、众两院中都占了多数，占参议员四十九席，众议员二百三十二席。1956年改选后，参众两院仍以民主党占多数，不过，议席的变化还不算大，那年艾森豪威尔仍当选连任总统。但这次中期选举结果，大大不同了，共和党遭到了惨重的失败，它在参、众两院中的议席都一落千丈。
    应该怎样看待这样的选举结果呢？当然，不论是美国的总统选举，或是国会改选，都是由大垄断资本集团所操纵的虚伪“民主”选举；但它在一定程度上也反映了美国政府的政策的不得人心。
    不民主的选举
    美国的选举制度是不民主的，既使进步党派很难取得合法的竞选地位，也使公民的选举权受到种种限制或被剥夺。根据各州的规定，针对劳动人民和黑人的选举权的限制，竟达五十余种之多，最普通的就是财产、教育和居住等限制，它们剥夺了成百万劳动人民的投票权，和大多数黑人的选举权。在这次国会和地方选举中，据美国政府统计，美国一共有一亿零五百万有选举权的适龄公民，但已经登记参加选举的只有七千五百多万人，实际参加投票的估计只有四千多万人。这是由于美国选民对共和、民主两党垄断的竞选已经越来越不感到兴趣。
