Make Native Steel Stand Tall
　　
　　Lian Fang

　　Three trials failed
　　
　　In the forging workshop of the practice factory of Chongqing First Mechanical Manufacturing Industrial School, several veteran craftsmen were placing lumps of native steel, smelted from backyard furnaces, into red furnaces to be forged. They were preparing to forge this native steel into steel that could be used to make machine parts. The blazing furnace fire made people's faces flush. Although the weather was already somewhat cold, standing in front of the red furnace to operate, one could not help but feel hot. Master craftsman Yuan Ranghong, while watching the native steel being forged in the red furnace, kept wondering in his mind: Can these lumps of "raw iron" be made into steel? He had some doubts. The native steel in the furnace was burned red-hot. Master Yuan clamped it out and placed it under the power hammer, but when the power hammer struck, the steel shattered. What was the reason? No one could find the reason. Master Yuan said, "Let's try raising the temperature a little higher." Everyone conducted a second trial, but it still cracked. At this time, those who were skeptical of native steel had even more grounds for their doubts. One of the veteran craftsmen said while working, "I'm decades old, and I've never seen 'raw iron' lumps turn into steel." Everyone conducted a third bending test, and all three failed.

　　Skeptics lost
　　
　　Forging craftsman Peng Shurong had just recovered from his illness. When he entered the workshop, he heard that the steel churned out by the backyard furnace could not withstand forging, and the trials had failed three times. When Master Peng was a teenager, he had forged raw iron in the countryside and personally saw raw iron being forged into hoes, axes, sickles, and other agricultural tools in the countryside. He said that the temperature must not have been high enough, and there were problems with the operating techniques. He carefully studied with everyone, raised the temperature again, and tried to improve the operation. Lumps of native steel were thrown into the furnace again. He personally controlled the air volume, increasing the air volume from small to large, and the steel in the furnace gradually turned from black to red. Master Peng kept turning the native steel. The lumps of steel gradually turned white from red. Master Peng estimated that the temperature was probably around 1200-1300 degrees Celsius, and the native steel must have been thoroughly heated. He clamped the steel out and placed it under the power hammer. The power hammer struck lightly and quickly. After experimenting and researching like this time after time, repeating it more than six times, the forged steel billet finally did not crack, and it did not break even when bent into a right angle. Those who thought that native steel was not steel had to admit defeat in the face of the facts.

　　Native steel surpassed foreign steel
　　
　　On October 20th, the school's Party General Branch decided to use native steel to make precision machine parts such as piston sheaths and chuck lead screws, and assigned this task to the practice factory. Everyone was eager to make machines as soon as possible when they heard that they were using their own smelted native steel to make machines. But is it okay to use this kind of steel to make precision parts? In the past, high-quality carbon steel was used to make these parts. Regarding this question, even Master Peng Shurong was worried about whether its wear resistance could match foreign steel.

　　At three o'clock in the afternoon, the experimental work began. The workers in the machining workshop and the students participating in the internship were excitedly surrounding the forging workshop, waiting for the veteran craftsmen to forge the machine part blanks. As soon as they got their hands on them, they immediately put them on the machine tools for processing. After a continuous thirty hours of hard work, they finally made precision machine parts such as piston sheaths and chuck lead screws on the morning of October 22nd. After inspection, the quality was good, and it was exactly the same as similar parts made of foreign steel. The hardness of the piston sheath after carburizing and quenching also reached the requirements, which proved that its wear resistance was also very good.

　　At the end of October, the teachers and students of this school used the steel churned out by the backyard furnace to make a five-foot lathe.

    要使土钢扬眉吐气
    廉芳
    三次试验都失败了
    在重庆第一机械制造工业学校实习工厂的锻压车间里，几个老师傅正在将鸡窝炉炼出的一团团土钢放进红炉里锻烧。他们准备将这土钢锻打成能制机件的钢材。熊熊的炉火，映得人们的脸通红，天气虽已有些寒意，但站在红炉面前操作，也不免发热。袁让洪老师傅一面注视着红炉里锻烧的土钢，一面又不住地在心眼里盘算：这样一团团的“毛铁”能打成钢吗？他有些怀疑。炉里的土钢被烧得通红，袁师傅将它夹出放在汽锤下，可是汽锤一打下去，钢就散了。是什么原因呢？大家都找不出原因。袁师傅说：“再将温度加高些试试看”。大家又进行第二次试验，还是裂纹。这时，对土钢有怀疑的人更有根据了，一个老师傅边作边说：“我几十岁了，就没看见‘毛铁’团团能变成钢。”大家又进行第三次弯曲试验，三次都失败了。
    怀疑派输了
    锻工师傅彭树荣刚病好，走进车间就听说鸡窝炉炒的钢经不住锻打，试验三次都失败了。彭师傅十几岁时在农村打过毛铁，亲见农村里就是用毛铁锻打制成锄头、斧头、柴刀等各种农具。他说，一定是温度烧得不够，操作技术上有问题。他同大家细致地研究，将温度再加高，设法改进操作。一团团的土钢又被扔进了炉子。他亲自掌握好风量，鼓风量由小加到大，炉里的钢材也由黑色逐渐变成了红色。彭师傅不停地翻动土钢材。团团的钢材又由红色烧得发白。彭师傅估计，温度大概到了摄氏一千二、三百度了，土钢也一定烧透了心。他把钢材夹出来放在汽锤下，汽锤轻而快地直往下打。像这样一次次地试验研究，反复六次以上，锻打的钢胚终于不裂口了，就是弯曲成直角也不断裂。那些认为土钢不是钢的人，也不得不在事实面前服输了。
    土钢比上了洋钢
    10月20日，校党总支决定用土钢制成活塞鞘和卡盘丝杆等精密机器部件，并把这个任务交给了实习工厂。大家一听说是用自己炼出的土钢制机器，都恨不得马上就造出机器来。但是用这种钢造精密部件行吗？过去制这些部件都是采用优质碳素钢。对这个问题，就连彭树荣师傅也担心它的耐磨程度能否赶得上洋钢。
    下午三点，试验工作开始了，机械加工车间的工人和参加实习的同学都兴奋地围在锻压车间等老师傅锻打机件毛胚，一拿到手便立刻放在机床上去加工。经过连续三十小时的奋战，终于在10月22日上午制成了活塞鞘、卡盘丝杆等精密的机器部件。经检验质量良好，和洋钢制成的同类零件完全一样。活塞鞘经过掺碳淬火硬度也达到了要求，这证明它的耐磨性也是很好的。
    10月底，这个学校的师生又用鸡窝炉炒出的钢制成了一部五呎元车。
