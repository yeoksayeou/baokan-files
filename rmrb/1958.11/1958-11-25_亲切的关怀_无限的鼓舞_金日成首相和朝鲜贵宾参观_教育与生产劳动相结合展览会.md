Affectionate Concern and Infinite Encouragement
—Premier Kim Il-sung and Distinguished North Korean Guests Visit the "Exhibition of Combining Education with Productive Labor"
By our reporters Yuan Mu and Ye Feng

"Combining education with production is the best approach to cultivating builders of socialism and communism," Premier Kim Il-sung, full of vigor, picked up a brush, dipped it in thick ink, and left his autograph and this beautiful inscription in the commemorative album of the "Exhibition of Combining Education with Productive Labor."

The boundless concern and encouragement shown by the Chinese people's closest friend during the visit were like a tremendous current of warmth, warming the hearts of all those present. Today, when Premier Kim Il-sung, accompanied by Vice Premier He Long and other distinguished guests of the North Korean Government Delegation and Military Delegation, came to visit the exhibition, they were greeted with extreme enthusiasm, with crowds cheering on both sides of the road.

Excited people flocked around the respected leader of the North Korean people and all the distinguished guests as they arrived at the exhibition's Comprehensive Hall. Here, the Premier happily saw the achievements of China's universities and secondary schools in vigorously tackling cutting-edge science and technology, and the new atmosphere of schools running factories in a big way, and factories and rural areas running schools in a big way. As the distinguished guests carefully viewed the exhibited atomic reactor, cyclotron, and computers, the exhibition staff told the Premier that in the past two or three months, teachers and students from universities and secondary schools in various places had newly made more than ten cyclotrons and more than forty electronic simulators. Premier Kim Il-sung said very happily: "These achievements vividly show that you have broken the mystification of the atomic and electronic industries that some people had through your own practical actions!"

In front of a facsimile machine undergoing a practical demonstration, the operator, Zeng Liangbao, presented to the respected Premier the authentic telegram slogans "Long Live the Great Friendship Between the Chinese and Korean People!" and "Welcome Respected Premier Kim Il-sung" just transmitted by the facsimile machine, as well as a portrait of Premier Kim Il-sung. Zeng Liangbao, a young man from Chengdu Telecommunications Engineering School, participated in the design and manufacture of this facsimile machine. He told the distinguished guests that in the past, they only knew how to learn the knowledge of mastering the facsimile method from foreign technical books, and no one dared to imagine creating such a foreign machine themselves. Now the superstition that people are afraid of machines has been broken. After listening to Zeng Liangbao's explanation, Premier Kim Il-sung happily wrote the word "Education" in Korean on the teleprinted paper. Before long, this newly sent "authentic telegram" was delivered to Premier Kim Il-sung's hand.

Premier Kim Il-sung excitedly walked to a batch of highly precise equipment and instruments sent by Fudan University. A young female staff member told the Premier that a "three-stage metal oil fractionation diffusion pump" made by their school with the assistance of factory workers has surpassed the quality of similar products in the UK. This diffusion pump is used for vacuuming equipment such as cyclotrons and electron microscopes. Now some teachers and students in their school are working hard to fully reach the international level in high-vacuum equipment within a few years. Having received Premier Kim Il-sung's encouragement, this young woman was very excited, with flushes of red on her face.

A twelve-year-old primary school student and a very interesting model appeared in front of the distinguished guests. A naughty little boy sat on a seesaw, below which was a water pump. As the seesaw went up and down, clear water flowed continuously to the green farmland. The inventor of this air-pressure water pump, Zhai Shunyu, the son of a poor peasant from Shanxi, stood beside the model, demonstrating to the distinguished guests and giving a vivid and interesting explanation. Premier Kim Il-sung, Comrade Park Jeong-ae, Comrade Nam Il, General Kim Kwang-hyup, and other distinguished guests watched Zhai Shunyu's lively and lovely expression, and from time to time gave hearty laughter.

"Very good, very good," Premier Kim Il-sung said after seeing the little inventor's demonstration, stroking Zhai Shunyu's head, and praising him repeatedly: "You are so smart, as long as you study hard, you will definitely become a great scientist in the future."

A small blast furnace model spewing out raging flames attracted the attention of the distinguished guests. Around this small blast furnace were displayed various steel and rare metal samples sent by schools from all over the country. The eight large characters "New people make steel, steel makes new people," made of neon lights, radiated dazzling brilliance at the exhibition. The staff told the Premier that the steel produced by schools across the country this year alone will reach 1.58 million tons. Premier Kim Il-sung encouraged everyone, saying, "Steel is very important, we must speed up."

In the square in front of the Comprehensive Hall, the distinguished guests carefully viewed the petroleum exploration equipment, various automobiles, and tractors designed or manufactured by teachers and students from universities and secondary schools in various places. In front of two tractors for paddy fields and mountainous areas, the Premier and the distinguished guests lingered for a long time. The staff told the Premier that these two tractors had just been trial-produced and sent to the exhibition, and had not yet undergone good field tests. Their performance needs to be further evaluated. Premier Kim Il-sung then said: "It doesn't matter, because the creators' ideals are very good, they will surely succeed."

More than two hours had passed, but Premier Kim Il-sung and the distinguished guests, disregarding their fatigue and sacrificing their precious rest time, went to visit the Jilin Pavilion at the exhibition. Premier Kim Il-sung had previously led the North Korean people for a long time in Jilin Province and the Northeast region to help the Chinese people resist Japanese imperialism. Today, when Premier Kim Il-sung saw the new face of Jilin Province in the Great Leap Forward, he was always so happy. The Premier was pleased to learn that Jilin Province became the first province without illiteracy in the country in July this year, and the number of universities, middle schools, primary schools, and various red-and-expert schools has increased several times to dozens of times. The Premier constantly said in a praising tone during the visit: "Very good, very good!"

No most beautiful words can describe the moving scene when the distinguished guests visited the "Young Pioneers Pavilion" in Jilin Province. The Premier and the distinguished guests' unparalleled concern for the new generation in Jilin Province left an indelible memory here for everyone. In front of them were a group of "Young Pioneers" happily working in their small factories, and pairs of beautiful small leather shoes, small leather bags, and small spoons were made from their dexterous hands.

Premier Kim Il-sung and Comrade Park Jeong-ae stroked the heads of two little girls, Liu Jinyan and Liang Guifang, listening quietly to their fluent explanations:

"It takes a total of eleven processes to make a pair of small leather shoes..." "Our small leather bags are made entirely of useless scraps of leather..." The respected Premier Kim Il-sung and Comrade Park Jeong-ae held the two children tightly in their arms, and asked the photojournalist to take a photo of them. Premier Kim Il-sung happily said: "We want to take this photo back to show the children in North Korea." Several "Young Pioneers" representatives from their four small factories presented Premier Kim Il-sung and the distinguished guests with their own small products tied with beautiful silk ribbons. Liu Jinyan, holding a small red leather bag, walked to Comrade Park Jeong-ae, raised her small hand and gave a Young Pioneer salute, excitedly saying: "Mom Park, I give you this gift!" Comrade Park Jeong-ae once again held her tightly, kissed her warmly, and pinned a commemorative badge with Kim Il-sung's image on her chest.

As the "Young Pioneers" reluctantly parted with Premier Kim Il-sung and the distinguished guests, Comrade He Long said to them: "Comrade Kim Il-sung has brought you glory. Study hard, you are the happiest generation!" After the distinguished guests left here after visiting for more than three hours, all the young technicians, students, Young Pioneers, and staff members working at the exhibition still recalled Premier Kim Il-sung's care and encouragement with a sense of glory and happiness.

    亲切的关怀　无限的鼓舞
    ——金日成首相和朝鲜贵宾参观“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”
    本报记者　袁木　冶峰
    “教育与生产相结合是培养社会主义和共产主义建设者的最好方针”，神采奕奕的金日成首相提起一枝毛笔，满醮浓墨，在“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”的纪念册上留下了他的亲笔签名，写下了这个美好的题词。
    中国人民最亲密的朋友在参观中流露出来的那种无限关怀和鼓励的情意，就像一股巨大的热流，温暖了所有在场的人们的心。今天，当金日成首相同朝鲜政府代表团和军事代表团全体贵宾由贺龙副总理等陪同前来参观展览会时，他们受到了极其热烈的欢迎，到处都是夹道欢呼的人群。
    激动的人们簇拥着敬爱的朝鲜人民领袖和全体贵宾来到了展览会的综合馆。在这里，首相高兴地看到了我国高等学校和中等学校猛攻尖端科学技术的成就，看到了学校大办工厂和工厂、农村大办学校的新气象。在贵宾们仔细地观看展出的原子反应堆、回旋加速器和那些计算机时，展览会的工作人员告诉首相，在最近两三个月中，各地高等学校和中等学校师生新制成的回旋加速器就有十多架，新制成的电子模拟机等有四十多台。金日成首相非常高兴地说：“这些成就生动地表明，你们已经用自己的实际行动打破有些人们对原子工业和电子工业的神秘主义观念了！”
    在一架正在进行实际操作表演的传真机的面前，操作表演者曾良宝，把刚刚利用这架传真机电传出来的“中朝人民的伟大友谊万岁！”“欢迎敬爱的金日成首相”等真迹电报标语，还有金日成首相的一幅肖像，献给了敬爱的首相同志。来自成都电讯工程学校的青年曾良宝参加过这架电传机的设计和制造工作，他告诉贵宾们，过去他们只知道从外国技术书本上学习如何掌握电传方法的知识，谁也不敢想像自己创造这种洋机器，现在人们骇怕机器的迷信被打破了。金日成首相听了曾良宝的解说以后，高兴地提笔在电传纸上用朝鲜文写下了“教育”两字，过不多久，这封刚刚发出的“真迹电报”就送到了金日成首相的手里。
    金日成首相兴奋地走到复旦大学送来的一批高度精密的设备和仪器面前，一位女青年工作人员告诉首相说，他们学校在工厂工人协助下制成的一种“三级金属油分馏扩散泵”，质量已经超过了英国的同类产品，这种扩散泵是回旋加速器、电子显微镜等设备抽真空时用的。现在他们学校的一些师生正为几年内在高真空设备方面全面达到国际水平而努力。得到了金日成首相的勉励和鼓舞，这位女青年非常激动，脸上泛起了一阵又一阵的红光。
    贵宾们面前出现了一个十二岁的小学生和一个十分有趣的模型。顽皮的小男孩坐在一副跷跷板上，下面是一个抽水机，跷跷板一上一下，清水就源源不断地流向绿油油的农田。这个汽压抽水机的发明者，来自山西的一位贫农的儿子翟顺玉站在模型的旁边，一面给贵宾表演，一面现身说法，作着生动有趣的解释。金日成首相、朴正爱同志、南日同志、金光侠大将和其他贵宾们看着翟顺玉那活泼可爱的表情，不时发出爽朗的笑声。
    “很好，很好”，金日成首相看了小发明家的现身说法以后，抚摸着翟顺玉的头，连声称赞：“你是这样的聪明，只要好好学习，将来一定能成为一个大科学家。”
    一座正在喷射着熊熊火焰的小高炉模型，吸引了贵宾的注意力。在这座小高炉的周围，陈列着全国各地学校送来的各种钢铁和稀有金属样品，用霓虹灯做成的“新人炼钢，钢炼新人”八个大字，在展览会上放射着耀眼的光彩。工作人员告诉首相，仅仅全国各地学校今年生产的钢铁就将达到一百五十八万吨。金日成首相勉励大家说：“钢铁很重要，我们要加快速度”。
    在综合馆前面的广场上，贵宾们细致地观看了各地高等学校和中等学校的师生们设计或制造的石油勘探设备，各种汽车和拖拉机。在两架水田和山地用的拖拉机前，首相和贵宾们留连了很久。工作人员告诉首相，这两架拖拉机刚刚试制成就送来展览，还没有经过很好的实地试验，它们的性能还要进一步加以鉴定。金日成首相紧接着说：“这不要紧，因为创制者的理想很好，他们就一定会获得成功。”
    时间已经过去了两个多小时，金日成首相和贵宾们仍然不顾疲劳，牺牲宝贵的休息时间，又专门去参观了展览会上的吉林馆。金日成首相过去曾经长时间地领导朝鲜人民在吉林省和东北地区帮助中国人民反抗日本帝国主义的斗争，今天，当金日成首相在这里看到大跃进中的吉林省的新面貌时，他一直是那样地欢乐。首相高兴地了解到，吉林省今年7月就成为了全国的第一个无文盲省，高等学校、中学、小学和各种红专学校已经增加了几倍到几十倍。首相在参观中不断以赞美地语调说：“很好，很好！”
    任何最美好的词句，也无法形容出贵宾们参观吉林省的“红领巾馆”时的动人情景。首相和贵宾们对吉林省新的一代的无比关怀，在这里给所有的人留下不可磨灭的记忆。眼前是一群“红领巾”正在他们的小工厂里愉快地劳动，一双双美丽的小皮鞋，一个个小皮包和小汤匙，从他们灵巧的双手中做了出来。
    金日成首相和朴正爱同志抚摸着刘巾雁和梁贵芳两个小女孩的头顶，静听着她们的流利的解说：
  “我们做一双小皮鞋一共有十一道工序……”“我们的小皮包完全是没有用的碎皮子做成的……”敬爱的金日成首相和朴正爱同志把两位小朋友紧紧地搂在胸前，让摄影记者替他们照像。金日成首相高兴地说：“这个像片我们要带回去给朝鲜的小朋友们看”。几位“红领巾”代表他们的四个小工厂，把他们自己亲手做的小产品缠着漂亮的绸带，献给金日成首相和贵宾们。刘巾雁捧着一个红色的小皮包，走到朴正爱同志的面前，举起小手行了个少先队礼，激动地说：“朴妈妈，我把这个礼物送给你！”朴正爱同志又一次紧紧地搂着她，热烈地吻她，把一个刻有金日成像的纪念章别在她的胸前。
    “红领巾”们恋恋不舍地同金日成首相和贵宾们分别时，贺龙同志对他们说：“金日成首相同志给你们带来了光荣。好好学习吧，你们是最幸福的一代！”贵宾们参观了三个多小时离开这里以后，所有在展览会上工作的青年技师、学生、少先队员和工作人员们，还怀着光荣和幸福的感情，久久地回忆着金日成首相对他们的关怀和鼓励。（附图片）
