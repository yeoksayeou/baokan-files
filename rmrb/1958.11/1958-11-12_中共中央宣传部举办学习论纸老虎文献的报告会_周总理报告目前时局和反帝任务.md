Xinhua News Agency, 10th: In order to widely launch the study of the important political document "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers," and to enable the broad masses of cadres to correctly understand the current situation of the struggle in the Taiwan Strait area, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee held a large-scale report meeting in the capital on the afternoon of the 10th.

Comrade Zhou Enlai made a report at the meeting entitled "The Current Struggle Situation in the Taiwan Strait Area and the Anti-Imperialist Tasks of the Chinese People." Comrade Zhou Enlai emphasized: "Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" is an extremely important political document. This document systematically, profoundly, and correctly answers the question of how to understand revolutionary forces and reactionary forces. We must correctly solve this problem in order to correctly deploy our strategic plans and strive for the victory of the revolutionary cause. Therefore, this important political document of Comrade Mao Zedong should be widely and deeply publicized among cadres at all levels inside and outside the Party and among the masses of the people; at the same time, according to the Marxist-Leninist viewpoints expounded in this document, the current situation of the struggle of the people of all countries in the world against imperialism, especially the aggression and oppression of US imperialism, and the current situation of the struggle in the Taiwan Strait area should be widely and deeply discussed among the broad masses of cadres and the people. In his report, Comrade Zhou Enlai gave a detailed analysis of the current international situation. He listed a series of major international events from World War II to the recent struggle in the Taiwan Strait area, proving the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong’s assertion that "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind," proving that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Then, Comrade Zhou Enlai made incisive explanations on the situation of the struggle in the Taiwan Strait area and some views on the relevant international situation.

This report meeting was held in Huairen Hall and broadcast simultaneously to more than 30 auditoriums. A total of more than 40,000 people listened to the report. Among them were: members and alternate members of the CPC Central Committee in Beijing, responsible cadres of Party, government, military, and civilian organizations at the central level and in Beijing, all members of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, responsible cadres from other places who came to Beijing for meetings, and Party activists. Some responsible comrades from the propaganda departments of provincial and municipal Party committees rushed to Beijing to listen to the report. Representatives of the National People's Congress and members of the CPPCC in Beijing, as well as responsible persons and cadres of various democratic parties, were also invited to participate in the report meeting.

After the report meeting, various units will widely and deeply study and discuss the important document "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report, and publicize it to the broad masses of the people.
