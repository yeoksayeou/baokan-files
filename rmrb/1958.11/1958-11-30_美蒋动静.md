    The United States Gives Chiang Kai-shek Another Sum of Money
    Xinhua News Agency, November 29th dispatch from Taipei: According to an announcement by the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Executive Yuan Council for United States Aid, in the fiscal year from July 1st of this year to June 30th of next year, the United States has approved $70 million in "economic aid" to the Chiang Kai-shek clique, an increase of $10 million compared to the previous fiscal year.
    The vast majority of this so-called "economic aid" is used to "support" the Chiang Kai-shek clique's military expenditures. The so-called "defense support funds" account for a staggering $67.5 million. Of this amount, $37 million involves the United States shipping surplus agricultural products to Taiwan to support the Chiang army and dumping them on the market.
