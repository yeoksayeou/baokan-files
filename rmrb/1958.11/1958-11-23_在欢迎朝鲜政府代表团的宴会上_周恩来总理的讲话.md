Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet Welcoming the North Korean Government Delegation

Respected Comrade Kim Il-sung, Respected Comrades of the Korean Government Delegation, the Korean Military Delegation, and the Korean Art Troupe, Comrades and Friends:

Today, we receive with great joy the distinguished guests from our close neighbor, Korea. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to Comrade Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people and a close friend of the Chinese people, and to all the comrades of the Korean Government Delegation he leads, as well as to the comrades of the Korean Military Delegation and the Korean Art Troupe. Through them, I extend my highest respect to the heroic Korean people.

At a time when the construction endeavors of China and Korea are advancing by leaps and bounds, and when the friendly cooperation between our two countries is developing in all aspects, the representatives of the Korean government and people have come to our country. Their visit is a tremendous encouragement to the Chinese people, who are going all out, aiming high, and striving to fulfill the 1958 production leap forward targets victoriously. The people of China and Korea have a traditional friendship, which was established and developed in the long-term revolutionary struggle against common enemies. It embodies the flesh-and-blood, shared-fate relationship between our two peoples, and it embodies the high spirit of proletarian internationalism. In the history of our two peoples' common struggle, there are many moving deeds, countless heroic figures whom we jointly cherish, and countless touching stories circulating among our two peoples. This is a friendship forged with the blood of the outstanding sons and daughters of our two countries; this is the most sublime friendship based on Marxism-Leninism; the power generated by this friendship is invincible!

During the eight years of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, the great support and meticulous care given to them by the Korean Workers' Party, the government, and all the Korean people, led by Comrade Kim Il-sung, is something we will never forget. During the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, the Korean government and the Korean people held an unprecedentedly warm send-off. This noble spirit of internationalism of the Korean people has deeply moved us. On behalf of the Chinese people, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Korean government and the Korean people.

Comrades, friends, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean government, and Comrade Kim Il-sung, the hardworking and brave Korean people are engaging in selfless labor to accelerate socialist construction. They are advancing at full speed with the heroic spirit of riding the Chollima (Thousand-Li Horse). Today's Korea is not the Korea of yesterday. In recent years, the Korean people have not only rapidly healed the wounds of war, but have also increased industrial and agricultural production beyond the highest pre-war levels. The entire northern part of Korea is showing a thriving scene. Now, the Korean people are developing the spirit of hard work and vigorous effort, striving to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The Chinese people cheer for the great achievements already made by the fraternal Korean people, and we wish them even greater achievements.

The withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea has opened up a new path for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, U.S. imperialism has consistently refused to withdraw its invading forces from Korea and recently manipulated its voting machine in the United Nations to pass the proposal on the Korean issue by the United States, Britain and 13 other countries. This once again shows that the United States, disregarding the wishes of the Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world, is determined to control South Korea with bayonets and obstruct the Korean people from peacefully reunifying their country. The United States knows perfectly well that it will never be possible to impose the one-sided conditions of the United Nations on the Korean people to resolve the Korean issue. They are doing this only to facilitate the long-term occupation of South Korea by the United States and to maintain and intensify the tense situation in the Far East at any time. This is a practice of making itself an enemy of all the Korean people, and the result can only be to tighten the noose around its own neck.

While launching the Korean War, the United States invaded and occupied our territory of Taiwan. Now, the aggressive troops of U.S. imperialism are not only entrenched in South Korea, but also continue to stay in Taiwan. It attempts to continue to occupy Japan, and using Japan as a base, continue to threaten the peoples of China and Korea from South Korea and the Penghu Islands of Taiwan. This is a war plan to enslave Japan, divide Korea, and create two Chinas. This plan of U.S. imperialism, although it looks arrogant, is actually throwing itself into a trap, throwing itself into the net of heaven and earth in which the people of Eastern countries are determined to eliminate the imperialist aggressors. There is no doubt that China's Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu must be liberated, and the three thousand li of magnificent rivers and mountains of Korea must be unified. The American paper tiger, which has already been exposed by the heroic Korean and Chinese people, cannot scare anyone.

Comrades, friends, I propose:

To the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and Korea,

To the consolidation and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,

For world peace,

To the health of Premier Kim Il-sung,

To the health of all comrades of the Korean Government Delegation, the Korean Military Delegation, and the Korean Art Troupe,

Cheers!

### 在欢迎朝鲜政府代表团的宴会上  周恩来总理的讲话

    在欢迎朝鲜政府代表团的宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的金日成首相同志，敬爱的朝鲜政府代表团、朝鲜军事代表团和朝鲜艺术团的同志们，同志们朋友们：
    今天，我们以非常愉快的心情接待我们亲密邻邦——朝鲜的贵宾们。我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖和中国人民亲密的朋友金日成同志和他率领的朝鲜政府代表团的全体同志们，以及朝鲜军事代表团和朝鲜艺术团的同志们，表示热烈的欢迎，并且通过他们，向英雄的朝鲜人民致以崇高的敬意。
    正当中朝两国的建设事业突飞猛进和我们两国的友好合作全面发展的时刻，朝鲜政府和人民的代表们来到了我国。他们的来访，对于正在鼓足干劲，力争上游，为胜利完成1958年生产跃进指标的中国人民是一个莫大的鼓舞。中朝两国人民有着传统的友谊，这种友谊是在长期反对共同敌人的革命斗争中建立和发展起来的，它体现了我们两国人民血肉相连、休戚与共的关系，它体现了高度的无产阶级国际主义精神。在我们两国人民共同奋斗的历史中，充满了许多可歌可颂的事迹，无数的英雄人物为我们所共同怀念，无数的动人故事在我们两国人民中间流传。这是我们两国人民的优秀儿女用鲜血凝成的友谊，这是建立在马克思、列宁主义基础上的最崇高的友谊，这种友谊所产生的力量是不可战胜的！
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的八年中，以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党、政府和全体朝鲜人民对他们的大力支援和无微不至的关怀，使我们永远感念不忘。在中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的过程中，朝鲜政府、朝鲜人民又举行了空前热烈的欢送。朝鲜人民这种高贵的国际主义精神，使我们非常感动。对此，我谨代表中国人民向朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民表示衷心的感谢。
    同志们，朋友们，勤劳、勇敢的朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府和金日成同志的领导下，正在为加速社会主义建设进行着忘我的劳动。他们正在以跨上千里马的豪迈气概，快马加鞭地前进。今天的朝鲜已经不是昨天的朝鲜了。几年来，朝鲜人民不仅迅速地医好了战争创伤，而且已经使工农业生产超过了战前的最高水平，整个朝鲜北部呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象。现在，朝鲜人民正在发挥苦干、猛干精神，为提前完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。中国人民为兄弟的朝鲜人民已经取得的巨大成就而欢呼，并且预祝他们取得更大的成就。
    中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜，为和平解决朝鲜问题开辟了新的道路。但是，美帝国主义始终拒绝从朝鲜撤出它的侵略军队，最近，又在联合国操纵它的表决机器，通过了美英等十三国关于朝鲜问题的提案。这就再一次表明了，美国不顾朝鲜人民和世界爱好和平人民的愿望，决心要用刺刀控制朝鲜南部，阻挠朝鲜人民和平统一自己的国家。美国完全知道，要把联合国解决朝鲜问题的片面条件强加在朝鲜人民身上是永远也办不到的，他们这样做，只是为了便于美国长期占领朝鲜南部，保持和随时加剧远东的紧张局势。这是一种不惜同全体朝鲜人民为敌的做法，其结果只能是把绞索更紧地套在自己的脖子上。
    美国在发动朝鲜战争的同时，侵占了我国的领土台湾。现在，美帝国主义的侵略部队不仅盘据着朝鲜南部，而且还赖在台湾不走。它企图继续占领日本，并且以日本为基地，从朝鲜南部和台湾澎湖继续威胁中朝两国人民，这是一个奴役日本、分裂朝鲜、制造两个中国的战争计划。美帝国主义这套计划，看起来好像是很狂妄，其实是自投罗网，自己投身到东方各国人民扑灭帝国主义侵略者的天罗地网里。没有任何疑问，中国的台、澎、金、马一定要解放，朝鲜的三千里壮丽河山一定要统一。已经被英勇的朝中人民戳穿了的美国纸老虎，是吓不倒任何人的。
    同志们，朋友们，我提议：
    为中朝两国人民牢不可破的友谊，
    为以苏联为首社会主义阵营的巩固团结，
    为世界和平，
    为金日成首相的健康，
    为朝鲜政府代表团、朝鲜军事代表团和朝鲜艺术团全体同志的健康，
    干杯！
