Organizing Professional Teams to Accompany Wheat Through the Winter
Shandong Launches Field Management Campaign of Replanting, Watering, and Topdressing

(Our Newspaper’s report) After victoriously completing the autumn sowing task, the millions of agricultural workers in Shandong Province have dispatched a strong force to launch a vigorous wheat field management campaign throughout the province, focusing on checking seedlings, replanting, watering, and topdressing.

Currently, the seventy million mu of wheat in the province are expanding their tillers, strengthening their roots, and densely covering the land in green. In order to achieve the goal of 1,000 jin per mu for the province and 10,000 jin per mu for the county, the vast number of farmers have established a long-term battle mentality, determined to accompany the wheat through the winter, observing the growth of the seedlings until the harvest. The wheat field management army throughout the province is now either organizing day and night shifts or establishing professional teams to implement assembly-line operations. Those in charge of accumulating fertilizer are collecting miscellaneous local fertilizers and building pit fertilizers everywhere; workers are rushing to produce indigenous chemical fertilizers day and night; livestock raisers are accumulating pen manure while transporting it. The water conservancy army has also begun to vigorously develop water sources and equipment according to the needs of wheat.

The reason why Shandong Province's wheat field management campaign can be carried out so rapidly and comprehensively is mainly due to mastering the art of leadership that combines work and rest, fighting hard for a period and then resting. The soldiers are energetic, the commanders have clear ideas, and the combat effectiveness is getting stronger and stronger. After completing the autumn sowing task, many counties in the province convened ten-thousand-person activist conferences to summarize production, exchange experiences, and deploy the next stage of work. After the activist conferences, several evenings were devoted to debates among the masses, which was actually a mass military exercise and rest for the whole people. Through this powerful measure, cadres and the masses not only got rest but also armed their minds. The right-leaning conservative arguments of a few people, such as "wheat grows well, so a good harvest is assured even without management," "only small areas can achieve high yields, not large areas," and the idea that people should rest in the winter after a year of hard work, were systematically criticized by the broad masses during this rest period.

In the specific leadership of wheat field management, the province has also promoted several basic management systems: First, according to the spirit of less planting, high yield, and more harvest, establish a basic field system. For example, the Liaocheng Special District planted a total of 14 million mu of wheat, and plans to cultivate 10 million to 11 million mu well, averaging 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu. The remaining wheat seedlings are transplanted to large-area high-yield fields, and concentrated processing and fertilization are carried out. These basic fields are all contracted level by level all the way down to the team or individual. Second, people's communes universally establish and train professional teams. Many counties and people's communes have now established wheat field management headquarters or committees, and the battalions and teams have established technical guidance groups, and selected a group of technical experts to participate in management. Counties such as Gaotang and Shenxian have also specially trained thousands of wheat technical administrators, who are assigned to fields by mu and block, implementing four guarantees: output, measures, technical procedures, and management personnel to the field. Third, promote the management method with the highest standard of "management like embroidery." Many places organize major inspections to conduct a major ranking of wheat seedlings, formulate agricultural operating procedures for different plots of land, which people call the "Wheat Management Constitution."

Due to the implementation of these basic management systems, the various armies engaged in wheat management now carefully cultivate seedlings like embroidery. For example, when applying topdressing, they patiently open ditches and insert fertilizer along the side of the wheat ridges, then level and water the ridges one by one, and then loosen the soil to preserve moisture, and crush the small clods of soil. People inspect their basic fields every day, segment by segment, and if they find an inch of blank space, they will replant a seedling.

    组织专业队陪伴小麦过冬天
    山东开展补苗浇水追肥田间管理运动
    本报讯　山东省千百万农业大军，在胜利完成秋种任务后，分出一支劲旅，在全省范围内掀起一个轰轰烈烈的以查苗补苗、浇水追肥为中心的麦田管理运动。
    现在这个省的七千万亩小麦，正在扩杈倒股、发根盘墩，一片片绿油油的连在一起。广大农民为了要实现小麦千斤省、万斤县，树立了持久战的思想，要陪伴小麦过冬，要看着苗子生长，一直到收割为止。现在全省各地的麦田管理大军，或者组织黑白班轮番作战，或者建立专业队，实行流水作业。管积肥的，到处搜集土杂肥，造坑肥；工人们日夜赶制土化肥；饲养人员，赶积圈肥，一边积一边运。水利大军也开始按照小麦的需要，大搞水源水具。
    山东省麦田管理运动所以能如此迅速全面开展，主要是掌握了劳逸结合，苦战一段休整一下的领导艺术，战士们精力充沛，指挥员思想明确，战斗力愈战愈强。这个省在完成秋种任务后，许多县召开了万人积极分子大会，总结生产，交流经验，布署下段工作。积极分子大会后，拿出几个晚上，在群众中辩论，实际上是一次全民性的大练兵大休整。通过这一有力措施，干部群众既得到休息，又武装了思想。少数人所谓“麦子种的好、长的旺，不管也丰收”；“只能小面积高产不能大面积丰产”以及认为苦干一年冬季该歇歇等右倾保守论调，在这次休整中间，广大群众给予了系统的批判。
    这个省在具体领导麦田管理时，还推行了几个基本的管理制度：一是根据少种、高产、多收的精神，建立基本田制度。如聊城专区共种小麦一千四百万亩，准备种好一千万到一千一百万亩，平均每亩收二千到三千斤，其他的麦苗移到大面积丰产田里，集中加工施肥。这些基本田，都采取层层包干的办法一直包到组或人。二是人民公社普遍建立与训练专业队。现在很多县和人民公社建立了麦田管理指挥部或委员会，营、队建立了技术指导小组，并选拔了一批技术能手参加管理。高唐、莘县等县还专门训练了数千名小麦技术管理员，这些人都分亩分块，实行产量、措施、技术规程、管理人四到田。三是推行“管理如绣花”的最高标准的管理方法。很多地方组织大检查进行麦苗大排队，分别不同地块，制定农业操作工序，人们称之为“小麦管理宪法”。
    由于推行了这些基本的管理制度，现在进行小麦管理的各路大军，确实像绣花一样，精心进行幼苗的培育。如追肥时从麦垅一傍耐心的开沟插眼，追上肥再一垅垅的推平、浇水，而后再松土保墒，还把一个个的小土块碾碎。人们在自己的基本田里每天逐垅逐段的看它几遍，发现一寸空白地，也要补上一株苗。
