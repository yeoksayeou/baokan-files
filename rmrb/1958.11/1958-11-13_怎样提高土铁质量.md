How to Improve the Quality of Indigenous Iron
    Wu Baoshun

    Currently, the indigenous iron smelted by small blast furnaces has very low silicon, manganese, and carbon content, but very high sulfur content, which creates great difficulties for steelmaking. Therefore, improving the quality of indigenous iron is an important measure to ensure the steelmaking task.

    To improve the quality of indigenous iron, the first requirement is that small blast furnaces produce grey cast iron. Grey cast iron is iron smelted at a relatively high temperature, with a higher silicon content. This type of iron can only be smelted in furnaces with relatively high temperatures. So, how can the furnace temperature be increased? Based on the characteristics of small blast furnaces, the following measures should be taken:

    I. Where possible, preheat the air entering the indigenous blast furnace to increase the temperature of the combustion zone. There are two ways to do this: first, add a pipe that is two to one times thicker than the original hot air pipe to the hot air pipe entering the blast furnace, so that when the wind comes, it enters the thick pipe, and the bottom of the thick pipe is heated with coal, so that hot air can be obtained. The other is to install a hot air pipe at the bottom of the furnace or connect an air box at the throat of the furnace to use the waste heat from the top of the furnace to heat it. The air from the blower equipment passes through the air pipe and air box and then is sent into the furnace.

    II. Use an insulation layer for the furnace wall. Currently, many indigenous blast furnaces in various regions do not have an insulation layer between the refractory material and the outer red bricks, which causes a large amount of heat to dissipate, and the furnace temperature cannot be raised, making it impossible to maintain a high temperature. Therefore, these furnaces can consider adding an insulation layer during repairs, and new furnaces should add an insulation layer. The thickness of the insulation layer should be between thirty and fifty millimeters, and the material can be pulverized blast furnace slag and fine coal ash.

    III. Use a moisture-proof layer at the bottom of the furnace. To prevent moisture from the ground, a layer of oil felt paper can be added under the bottom of the furnace and above the furnace foundation. Red or blue bricks can be arranged with holes on top of the oil felt paper, and a hole should be left in the direction facing outward, so that moisture can escape through this hole. However, do not leave two holes to prevent convection from being generated under the bottom of the furnace, causing cooling.

    IV. Furnaces are prone to cooling in winter, so a windbreak wall should be built in the direction of the wind (usually the north wind), using mud bricks.

    Another problem in improving the quality of indigenous iron is reducing the sulfur content. The following measures can be taken to solve this problem:

    I. Minimize the sulfur and ash content in the indigenous coke. The main method is to wash the coking coal powder with water to reduce the ash content, which creates conditions for reducing the sulfur content.

    II. It is best to sinter iron sand into sintered blocks before smelting iron. Adding lime during the sintering process can more effectively reduce the sulfur content.

    III. Roast the ore: Some iron ores are magnetite. Magnetite has a dense structure and poor reducibility. If it is roasted with coal or indigenous coke before being charged into the furnace, the ore can be easily crushed, the reducibility can be strengthened, and some of the sulfur can be removed. The method of roasting the ore is also very simple. Build a small furnace with red bricks, with an opening on top and furnace bars below. A small opening is left above the furnace bars. The ore and fuel are added from the top and can be dug out from the bottom. Simply heat the ore until it is red.

    IV. The batching of indigenous blast furnaces should be accurate. Increasing the limestone to raise the alkalinity to 1% is beneficial for desulfurization and iron reduction.

    怎样提高土铁质量
    吴宝顺
    目前小高炉炼出的土铁，矽、锰、碳的含量很低，而硫却很高，这给炼钢造成很大困难。因此，提高土铁质量，是保证炼钢任务的一个重要措施。
    提高土铁质量，首先要求小高炉出灰口铁。灰口铁是冶炼温度比较高的铁，矽的含量较大。这种铁必须温度比较高的炉子才能炼出来。那么，如何才能提高炉的温度呢？根据小高炉的特点，应采取这样一些措施：
    一、在可能条件下，应预热进入土高炉的空气，增加燃烧带的温度。有两种办法，一是在进入高炉的热风管上加上比原热风管粗两倍到一倍的管，使风来以后进入粗管，粗管下面用煤来加热，这样即可得到热风。一是在炉底安热风管或炉喉处接风箱，利用炉顶的废热来加热。由鼓风设备来的风在风管和风箱内通过再送入炉内。
    二、炉墙用绝热层。现在许多地区的土高炉的耐火材料和外边的红砖没有绝热层，使大量的热散出，炉子温度提不起来，不能保持高温。因此，这些炉子在检修时可以考虑加上，新建的炉子则应加绝热层。绝热层的厚度应在三十到五十公厘，其材料可用粉碎的高炉渣和煤灰的细末。
    三、炉底下部用防潮层。为防止地下来的潮气，在炉底下面、炉基上面可加一层油毡纸，在油毡纸上面用红砖或青砖摆上花洞，在通向外面的地方再留一个孔，有潮气时由此孔冒出。但孔不能留两个，以防止在炉底下面产生对流造成冷却。
    四、冬天炉子容易冷却，应在迎风的方向上（一般是北风）砌一挡风墙，用泥坯就行。
    提高土铁质量另一问题是降低含硫量。解决这一问题可采取的措施有：
    一、把土焦中的硫和灰分尽量降低。主要方法是把炼焦的煤粉用水洗一下减少灰分，这就给降低含硫量创造了条件。
    二、铁砂炼铁，最好先经过烧结搞成烧结块。在烧结过程中加入石灰，这样可更有效地减少含硫量。
    三、焙烧矿石：有些铁矿石是磁铁矿，磁铁矿的组织细密、还原性很差，如果在入炉前用煤或土焦加以焙烧，可使矿石容易破碎，还原性加强，还可去除一部分硫。焙烧矿石的方法也很简单，用红砖搭一小炉，炉上面是开口的，下面有炉条，靠炉条上面留一小口，矿石和燃料由上面加入，由下面可以扒出，将矿石烧红即可。
    四、土高炉的配料要准确，可增加石灰石把碱度提高到1％，这对去硫和铁的还原都有好处。
