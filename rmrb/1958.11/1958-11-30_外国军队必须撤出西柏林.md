On November 27th, the Soviet government sent notes to the United States, Britain, and France, suggesting the elimination of the Berlin occupation regime and the transformation of West Berlin into a free city. Simultaneously, the four powers and the two German states would undertake obligations to respect West Berlin's status as a free city. This suggestion by the Soviet government will positively promote the normalization of the Berlin situation, facilitate contact between the two German states, and safeguard European peace and security. The Chinese people fully support this important suggestion by the Soviet government, which is conducive to a peaceful resolution of the German question and beneficial to the peace of Europe and the world.

Like the abnormal state of the entire divided Germany, Berlin, which should rightfully be a part of the territory of the German Democratic Republic, is also artificially divided into East and West Berlin. In the democratic area of Berlin, just like in other parts of the German Democratic Republic, under the correct leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the root of the scourge threatening world peace—German monopoly capital and militarist forces—has been eradicated forever. Today, it proudly stands as the capital of the German Democratic Republic, the first worker-peasant state in German history, and is steadfastly and victoriously marching along the path of building socialism and safeguarding world peace.

However, West Berlin remains under the military occupation of Western countries. While vigorously reviving West German militarism and transforming West Germany into a new war base, Western countries are also striving to turn West Berlin, which they occupy, into a paradise for German militarists and a center of the Cold War. In recent years, under the cultivation of Western countries, especially the United States and the West German government, Nazi fascist bacteria have proliferated in large quantities in West Berlin. Former fascists fill the government institutions of West Berlin, and militarist groups from the Hitler era have sprung up like poisonous mushrooms after the rain. More seriously, because West Berlin is located in the heart of the German Democratic Republic, the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany use it as a springboard to threaten and subvert the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries. They have established more than fifty special agent and spy organizations in West Berlin, using newspapers, radio stations, dispatching agents, digging tunnels, and even plotting armed riots, engaging in a series of criminal activities of sabotage and war provocation. When all this failed, they still clamored "to plan and organize uprisings throughout East Germany," regarding West Berlin as a "frontline city" deep inside Democratic Germany. All this is enough to prove that it is precisely the Western countries' occupation of West Berlin, and their policy of using it as a base for aggression against the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries, that has made the divide between East and West Berlin a focal point of contradictions and conflicts. This has aggravated the tension between East and West Germany and in the center of Europe. This situation not only deepens the division of Germany but also carries the risk of triggering a new war.

Therefore, the occupation of West Berlin is not an isolated issue. It is closely linked to the reunification of Germany and the security of Europe. History tells people that a militarist Germany once brought two great disasters to the people of the world. When the Second World War ended and the world's anti-fascist forces destroyed Hitler's lair, the people of the world rightfully raised the question: should German militarism and fascism be completely eradicated, and their harm to world peace be uprooted? Or should German militarism be preserved and restored, allowing it to continue its evildoing? Of course, people learned a lesson from painful historical experience: the former path must be taken. The Potsdam Agreement of August 1945 by the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain solemnly declared, reflecting the wishes of all nations: "German militarism and Nazism shall be eradicated, and the Allies shall agree unanimously on other necessary measures to be taken at present or in the future to ensure that Germany will never again threaten its neighbors or world peace." To fulfill this solemn obligation, the then four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France formulated many specific steps to control Germany. These steps, including the occupation regime of Germany, were never an end in themselves but were intended to help the healthy forces of the German nation establish a new, peace-loving, and democratic country on the ruins of militarism. The main spirit of the Potsdam Agreement should obviously become the highest criterion for dealing with the German question after the war; it has not only legal significance but also moral force. Facts over the past thirteen years have shown that the Potsdam Agreement has been fully implemented only on the territory of the German Democratic Republic, while it has been brutally violated in West Germany and West Berlin. Under the patronage of the United States, a militarist Germany has been revived and dragged into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, which is aimed at the socialist camp. Since the United States, Britain, France, and the West German government have trampled the basic principles and main contents of the Potsdam Agreement underfoot, the legal basis for their occupation of West Berlin has long been completely lost.

Today, there are two sovereign states on German territory: the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Since the Soviet Union has established relations between sovereign states with the German Democratic Republic and abolished all laws on German control, the German Democratic Republic, together with its capital Berlin, is a completely sovereign state. There are neither occupying countries nor occupation laws in this country. On the one hand, the Western countries stubbornly refuse to recognize the German Democratic Republic; on the other hand, they unscrupulously occupy its territory as a base for subverting and undermining Democratic Germany. This phenomenon is absolutely intolerable.

Therefore, from any point of view, there is no reason whatsoever for Western countries to continue to occupy West Berlin. Today, the Western countries' continued occupation of West Berlin merely facilitates their use of this occupation to create tension and escalate the Cold War. As Comrade Khrushchev pointed out, the policy of Western countries has turned West Berlin into a malignant tumor.

To eliminate this serious situation, created by Western countries and the West German government, which is harmful to German reunification and world peace, to establish a normal state in Europe and Germany, to sign a treaty that is in line with the interests of the German people, and to ensure mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence among all countries that fought against fascist Germany, the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic have long taken many steps and measures and put forward many reasonable and constructive suggestions. However, these many measures and suggestions have been unreasonably rejected by Western countries one by one. In their recent notes to the Soviet government, they still ignored the right of self-determination of the German people, ignored the existence of the German Democratic Republic, and insisted on unifying Germany by means of West Germany annexing Democratic Germany. This shows that Western countries, which have already violated the Potsdam Agreement, have no intention of turning back.

In this case, what should be done? Can peace-loving countries allow the malignant tumor of West Berlin to continue to seriously endanger the peace of Europe and the world because Western countries are obstructing the unification of Germany and refusing to sign a peace treaty with Germany? Can they allow Western countries to occupy West Berlin for a long time as a Cold War base for attacking socialist countries? Of course not. And if the malignant tumor is removed first, and West Berlin is solved as a separate problem, this can not only prevent the further deterioration of the situation, but also use the agreement reached on the West Berlin issue to promote the signing of a peace treaty with Germany and the reunification of Germany. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet government has proposed turning West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. This is another major effort by the Soviet government to strive for the reunification of Germany and to ease the tensions in Europe. Turning West Berlin into a demilitarized free city will first remove the foreign military occupation of the people of West Berlin, thereby eliminating foreign interference in the internal affairs of West Berlin and the suffering imposed on the people by the occupation regime. At the same time, doing so can also turn this past source of the Cold War into a peaceful city. Such a city will not be a bridgehead hostile to any party, and it will maintain friendly relations with both Eastern and Western countries and between East and West Germany. This can greatly eliminate the tension in the Berlin area, help improve the state of military confrontation in the center of Europe, and is conducive to establishing a solid peace in Europe. The Soviet government's proposal fully conforms to the interests of the German people and European peace.

Contrary to the Western countries' consistent obliteration of the German people's right to self-determination, the suggestion made by the Soviet government takes into consideration the different situations of the two parts of Germany and the wishes of the residents, and can allow the future free city of West Berlin to establish its own government and manage its own economy, administration, and other affairs. The Soviet government also guarantees to do its utmost to prevent interference in the internal affairs of West Berlin and to improve the living standards of the residents of West Berlin. All this demonstrates the Soviet government's respect for the will of the German people. Today, there are two Germanys on German land, two different social systems, and any suggestion for Germany must take this reality into account. Therefore, to solve the Berlin problem and the reunification of Germany, it is only possible to create conditions through consultation and rapprochement between the two Germanys. Any other method is contrary to the national interests of the German people. At present, people-to-people contact between the various aspects of East and West Germany is becoming more and more frequent. Despite the multiple obstructions of the United States and the Adenauer government, a supplementary trade agreement was signed between East and West Germany under the strong demands of the West German public. This proves that as long as there is no foreign interference, the people of the two parts of Germany are able to find a path to mutual understanding and cooperation. The Soviet government's proposal on the West Berlin issue has provided a practical and feasible way for the rapprochement between the people of East and West Germany and for promoting understanding between East and West Germany. If the two Germanys and the four major powers, which bear great responsibility for the reunification of Germany, can reach an agreement on the Soviet proposal, it will greatly improve relations between them and create favorable conditions for further concluding a peace treaty with Germany and reunifying Germany.

The Soviet government's proposal has been welcomed and supported by the German people and peace-loving people all over the world. However, Western countries, especially the United States, are still clamoring "not to give up privileges in Berlin." This can only prove that they are unwilling to see the peace, unity and development of Germany, unwilling to ease international tensions, and unwilling to improve relations between countries. However, we believe that no matter what attitude Western countries take, the abnormal state of foreign troops occupying West Berlin must come to an end, and Berlin must become a Berlin of the Germans.

### 外国军队必须撤出西柏林

    外国军队必须撤出西柏林
    11月27日，苏联政府向美、英法三国发出照会，建议消除柏林占领制度和使西柏林成为自由城市，同时四大国和两个德国将担承义务：尊重西柏林作为自由城市的地位。苏联政府的这一建议对于促使柏林局势的正常化，促进两个德国的接触以及维护欧洲的和平和安全，都将起积极的推动作用。中国人民完全支持苏联政府这一有利于和平解决德国问题、有利于欧洲和世界和平的重要建议。
    像整个德国处于分裂的不正常状态一样，目前，这个理应属于德意志民主共和国领土一部分的柏林也被人为地分成东西两个柏林。在柏林民主区，就跟德意志民主共和国的其他地方一样，在德国统一社会党的正确领导下，永远拔除了威胁世界和平的祸根——德国垄断资本和军国主义势力。今天它骄傲地成为德国历史上第一个工农国家德意志民主共和国的首都，并且正在坚定不移地沿着建设社会主义和维护世界和平的大道胜利迈进。
    但是西柏林仍然处于西方国家的军事占领之下。西方国家在大力复活西德军国主义，变西德为新的战争基地的同时，也竭力把它们占领下的西柏林变成为一个德国军国主义者的乐园和冷战中心。几年来在西方国家特别是美国和西德政府的培养下，纳粹法西斯细菌又在西柏林大量地繁殖起来。旧日的法西斯分子充塞在西柏林的政府机构，希特勒时代的军国主义团体也像雨后的毒菌那样蔓生滋长。更严重的是，由于西柏林地处民主德国的心脏，美国和英、法、西德政府把它作为威胁和颠复德意志民主共和国以及其他社会主义国家的跳板。他们在西柏林建立了五十多个特务间谍机构，利用报刊、电台、派遣特务、挖地道直到策划武装暴动等等一系列的罪恶活动进行破坏和战争挑衅。当这一切遭到失败之后，他们还在叫嚷“要计划和组织东德全境的起义”，把西柏林当作深入民主德国内部的“前线城市”。凡此种种都足以证明：正是西方国家对西柏林的占领，并且把它作为向民主德国、苏联和其他社会主义国家进行侵略活动的基地的政策，使得东西柏林之间形成了一个充满矛盾和冲突的焦点。这就加剧了东、西德之间及欧洲中心的紧张局势。这种状况不仅加深了德国的分裂，而且有导致爆发新战争的危险。
    因此，对西柏林的占领不是一个孤立的问题。它是同德国重新统一和欧洲的安全问题密切联系在一起的。历史告诉人们，一个军国主义的德国曾经给全世界人民带来了两次巨大的灾难。当第二次大战结束，世界反法西斯力量摧毁希特勒的巢穴时，世界人民也就正当地提出这样的问题：彻底铲除德国军国主义和法西斯主义，根除它们对世界和平的危害呢？还是保存和恢复德国军国主义，让它继续为非作歹呢？当然人民从惨痛的历史经验中得出教训：必须走前一条路。而1945年8月的苏美英三国波茨坦协定也正是反映了各国人民的这一愿望而庄严地宣告：“德国之军国主义及纳粹主义将予根除，各盟国将一致同意于目前或未来采取其他保证使德国永远不再威胁其邻邦与世界和平之必要措施”。为了实现这个庄严的义务，当时苏、美、英、法四国制定了许多管制德国的具体步骤。这些步骤，包括对德国的占领制度在内，从来就不是它本身的目的，而是为了帮助德国民族的健康力量在军国主义的废墟上建立一个新的爱好和平和民主的国家。波茨坦协定这一主要的精神，显然应当成为战后处置德国问题的最高的准则；它不仅具有法律上的意义，而且具有道义上的力量。十三年来的事实表明，波茨坦协定只是在德意志民主共和国的领土上得到了完全的实现，而在西德和西柏林则遭到了粗暴的破坏。在美国的扶植之下，一个军国主义的德国重又复活起来，并且被拉入了矛头针对社会主义阵营的北大西洋侵略集团。既然美国和英法及西德政府已经把波茨坦协定的基本原则和主要内容践踏在脚下，那么它们据以占领西柏林的法律基础也早已完全丧失了。
    今天德国领土上存在着两个主权国家，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国。由于苏联已经同德意志民主共和国建立了主权国家之间的关系，并且废除了对德管制的各项法律，德意志民主共和国连同它的首都柏林是一个完全的主权国家，在这个国家内既不存在占领国，也不存在占领法。美英法西方国家一方面顽固地拒绝承认德意志民主共和国，一方面又肆无忌惮地占领着它的领土作为颠复和破坏民主德国的基地。这种现象是绝对不能容忍的。
    因此，无论从哪一方面来看，西方国家继续占领西柏林是完全没有理由的。今天西方国家继续占领西柏林仅仅便于他们利用这种占领制造紧张局势和加剧冷战。这正像赫鲁晓夫同志指出的，西方国家的政策已经把西柏林变成了一个毒瘤。
    为了消除西方国家和西德政府所造成的这种有害德国重新统一和世界和平的严重局势，为了在欧洲和德国建立正常状态、签订一个符合德国人民利益的和约，并保证同法西斯德国作过战的各国之间的相互谅解和和平共处，长期以来，苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府曾经采取过许多步骤和措施，提出了许多合理的建设性建议。但是这许多措施和建议都一个一个被西方国家无理拒绝了。不久以前，它们向苏联政府发出的照会中，依然无视德国人民的自决权利，无视德意志民主共和国的存在，坚持以西德吞并民主德国的办法来统一德国。这就表明，已破坏波茨坦协定的西方国家已经无意回过头来了。
    在这种情况下，该怎么办呢？爱好和平的国家能够听任因为西方国家阻挠统一德国、拒绝签订对德和约，而继续眼看西柏林这个毒瘤越来越严重地危害欧洲和世界的和平吗？能够任凭西方国家长期霸占西柏林作为进攻社会主义国家的冷战基地吗？当然不能够。而如果首先割除这个毒瘤，把西柏林作为一个单独问题来解决，这就不仅可以阻止局势的进一步恶化，而且也可以借助在西柏林问题上达成的协议来促进对德和约的签订和德国的重新统一。正是因为这个缘故，苏联政府提出了把西柏林变成非军事的自由城市的建议，这是苏联政府争取德国重新统一、缓和欧洲紧张局势的又一次重大努力。把西柏林变为非军事的自由城市将首先解除对西柏林人民的外国军事占领，从而免除外国对西柏林的内政的干涉和由占领制度加在人民身上的痛苦。同时这样做也可以把这个过去的冷战策源地变成一个和平的城市。这样一个城市将不是敌视任何一方面的桥头堡，它同东西方国家和东西德之间都保持友好的关系。这就能够大大消除柏林地区的紧张局势，有助于改善在欧洲中心的军事对立的局面，有利于在欧洲建立巩固的和平。苏联政府的建议，完全符合德国人民和欧洲和平的利益。
    同西方国家一贯抹煞德国人民的自决权利的情况相反，苏联政府提出的这个建议考虑到德国两部分的不同情况和居民的愿望，可以允许未来的西柏林自由城市成立自己的政府，可以自己管理自己的经济、行政和其他事务。苏联政府并且保证尽一切努力使西柏林的内政不受干涉，提高西柏林居民的生活水平。这一切表明了苏联政府对德国人民意志的尊重。今天德国土地上存在两个德国，两种不同的社会制度，任何对德国的建议都必须考虑这种现实的情况。因此要解决柏林问题和德国的重新统一，只有通过两个德国的协商和接近来创造条件。任何其他的办法都是违反德国人民的民族利益的。目前东、西德之间各方面人民的接触是越来越频繁了。尽管美国和阿登纳政府多方阻挠，但是在西德公众的强烈要求下，东西德之间签订了补充贸易协定。这就证明，只要没有外国的干涉，德国两部分人民是能够找到相互谅解和合作的道路的。苏联政府关于西柏林问题的建议，已经为东、西德人民的接近，为促进东、西德之间的谅解提供了切实可行的途径。如果两个德国和对德国重新统一问题负有重大责任的四大国之间能够就苏联的建议达成协议，那就会大大改善它们之间的关系，并且为进一步缔结对德和约、重新统一德国创造有利的条件。
    苏联政府的建议，受到了德国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的欢迎和支持。但是西方国家，特别是美国却仍然在叫嚣“不放弃在柏林的特权”。这只能证明他们不愿看到德国的和平、统一和发展，不愿缓和国际紧张局势，不愿改善各国之间的关系。但是，我们相信，不管西方国家采取什么态度，外国军队占领西柏林的不正常状态是一定要结束的，柏林必须成为德国人的柏林。
