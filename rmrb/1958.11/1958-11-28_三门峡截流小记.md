    A Short Account of the Sanmenxia Damming
    Lei Jia
    Morning
    It was a morning after a long spell of rain.
    At five o'clock, I was awakened by the bugle call for morning exercises. Thinking it might be a clear day, I looked out the window and saw a sky full of stars. I couldn't fall back asleep.
    I hurried to Shijiatan for breakfast, but it wasn't even six o'clock yet. On the blackboard in the dining hall was written: "Yesterday's comb-tooth water flow, damming exercise starts today."
    This wasn't an official notice, but it carried the air of battle. Xie Hui, the deputy director of the Engineering Bureau, was the first to arrive at the dining hall, and he had written it. He had taken his time shaving this morning, but now he was hastily drinking his porridge. No one could tell that he hadn't slept well all night in preparation for the battle.
    When Director Wu of the Technology Department ran over wearing a bamboo hat, the jeep set off for the dam head. At the workers' meeting, Deputy Director Xie announced that the damming exercise would officially begin today. After reporting the task figures and mechanical equipment, he went on to say:
  "This year's water conditions are severe, with the biggest flood in fifty years; but the damming cannot be delayed any longer, or the ice floes will come. Water is flowing through the comb-tooth structure on the left bank, and the water level has dropped by nearly a meter. We've drilled blasting holes on Ren Island. After the Shen River is dammed, we'll blast several thousand cubic meters of the Shenmen spillway; we've also prepared two thousand cubic meters of blasting holes for the Guimen spillway. This will force the water to flow over. We've thought of every way to reduce the flow rate and ensure the damming. The command headquarters will hold a meeting to study the situation in the last shift today. If there are no changes, we will continue. Everyone, be prepared!"
    Water Conditions
    The water conditions were not ideal. In previous years, the flow rate at this time was already below one thousand cubic meters per second. With a large safety coefficient, the design flow rate was one thousand; but this morning at eight o'clock, the flow rate was two thousand and ten.
    The water condition reports measured in the past few days were really worrying. On October 15, it was four thousand three hundred and eighty. On November 7, it dropped to one thousand nine hundred and eighty, but on the 14th, it rose again to two thousand three hundred and ninety. It had been raining intermittently for those few days, and this rain was also unprecedented in recent decades. The exercise days were repeatedly postponed, and the official damming day could not be determined. The stones for throwing were prepared, like artillery shells, and the machinery was also overhauled, like cannons cleaned, just waiting for the firing order. However, the rain still hadn't stopped on the 13th, there was rain in the Huayin area on the 14th, and the river water might rise. It cleared up slowly on the 15th, and turned cloudy again on the 16th… Everyone seemed to have turned into a hydrological station and a weather station, concerned about water conditions and weather. Although the Yellow River could not be taken lightly, and with wind and rain helping, the desire for battle grew stronger and stronger. On November 17, it suddenly cleared up, and we couldn't wait any longer. The snow on Cone Mountain foreshadowed the early arrival of ice floes, but the flow rate on this day was two thousand and ten, more than double the design flow rate.
    The First
    Who is the first? The first to break ground, the first to cut the ribbon, in the cause of battle, the hero is the first.
    In the past, there were the first to drill here, the first to install the suspension bridge, the first to blast, the first to pour concrete, and the first to drive pipe piles; but now everyone wants to be the first to dam the river.
    Not everyone can directly participate in the damming, just as not every machine can directly participate in the damming. For example, the Finance Department put forward the slogan: Wash clothes for the workers who are damming! To make an indirect contribution of one's own strength is the supreme glory. Wu Manshan is a famous pneumatic drill operator. The concrete dam foundation was excavated by them, and the large stones prepared for damming were drilled by them with pneumatic drills; but his biggest worry during this period was not knowing whether he could directly participate in the damming. He signed up to join the commando team, and he also read the pledge at the oath-taking rally. Because hundreds of people had signed up, and hundreds of people had read the pledge, it was clear that even Wu Manshan was not guaranteed to have this opportunity. Knowing that just signing up was not reliable, he went to the Youth League Committee and the Party Committee every day. It's not known when he started doing this; but others later discovered his pattern: if he was in the first shift, it was around two or three in the afternoon, if he was in the second shift, it was around six or seven in the evening… Anyway, he came at that time. He always repeated these words: "Everything is prepared, we've had ideological meetings, if there are any deviations when the time comes, what will happen!" "We only have this requirement. If the requirement is not met, if my request is not approved, I will have my opinion." Nothing is ever too difficult for a determined person, and he finally became the luckiest one. He was not only the leader of the damming commando team, but also the first shift to start the damming. He immediately put on his white life jacket, making his face look even darker. His face has always been as lively and powerful as a warrior who has fought with rocks.
    Zhen Fengxian, who was doing rescue work, I had seen her photo in the Sanmenxia newspaper. Because of her good work, she was called a white-clad warrior, and she was also the first to arrive.
    Bulldozer driver Ye Cheng was formerly a labor model at the Guanting Reservoir. This time, he worked hard for three days and nights repairing the locomotive. He, like that Stalin-80 bulldozer, was the pride of the construction site.
    Maybe it was Zhao Xuheng, maybe it was Liu He (two electric shovel drivers), who loaded the first truckload of material. At this time, a fifteen-ton truck drove across the Guimen spillway bridge and went down along the access road. This truck turned ninety degrees at the access point, then reversed to the bank of the Shen River, and the first truckload of material was solemnly dumped into the Yellow River at 9:05.
    The name of the first truck driver was Tang Yuqi. I saw him leaning out of the car window, looking back at the slowly rising truck bed. Although he was sitting in the driver's seat, his chest rose and fell sharply, as if he had just run a hundred meters himself.
    The New Renmen River
    The determination to conquer the Yellow River has long existed. It started with Deputy Premier Deng Zihui's report, and it started on the day of the groundbreaking ceremony. Later, we excavated the foundation pit and blasted away the rocks; later, we poured concrete. Once the first-stage cofferdam was built, the Ren River became a dry river. Now that we are going to dam the river, the intercepted main stream will be diverted to flow through the comb-tooth structure. What is damming? It is a major relocation of the main stream of the Yellow River, telling it to make way so that we can carry out the second phase of the project. At 12:15 on July 16, water officially flowed through the comb-tooth structure. The old Renmen River disappeared, and the new Renmen River appeared. The history of the Yellow River has turned a new page. This is an artificial river that surpasses Dayu's appearance on the Yellow River. The new Renmen River will welcome the main stream today, and serve the entire power generation and irrigation tomorrow. It was born in the New China. It was tamed by the working class of today, so it is even more worthy of pride.
    The appearance of the new Renmen River is the first step in the great victory of conquering the Yellow River.
    A day and night of damming has passed. When the morning sun rose the next day, the searchlights on the entire river surface were extinguished along with the stars in the sky. In just two shifts, a total of more than six thousand cubic meters of stone were thrown, advancing more than two meters. The car circulation was good, and the safety arrangement (car platforms made of steel rails) was unexpectedly successful.
    Below the command headquarters, in the light blue diesel fumes, a red flag of a commando team fluttered in the wind. Bursts of car and tractor sounds came in through the windows of the tent. Deputy Director Xie worked two shifts for a day and night. He was not only not tired, but also excited about the smooth work.

    三门峡截流小记
    雷加
    早晨
    这是一个久雨初晴的早晨。
    五点钟，我被上操的口令声惊醒，一想可能是晴天，果然从窗上漏进满天星斗，再也睡不着了。
    赶到史家滩吃早饭，还不到六点。饭厅黑板上写着：“昨天梳齿过水，截流演习今天开始了。”
    这不是正式通知，可带着战斗气息。工程局谢辉副局长，第一个来到饭厅，这就是他写的。他今早不慌不忙地刮过胡子，这一阵却急忙喝稀饭。谁也看不出他为了迎接战斗，一夜没有睡好。
    当技术处吴处长戴着柳斗帽跑来的时候，小吉普便向坝头开去了。在工人会上，谢副局长宣布了截流演习今天正式开始。他报告了任务数字、机械配备之后，接着又说道：
  “今年水情严重，这是五十年一遇的大水；但是截流不能拖后，再晚凌汛就来了。左岸梳齿过水，水势下去将近一公尺。人岛打了炮眼，神河截流之后，神门泄水道就爆破它几千方；鬼门泄水道，也准备两千方的炮眼。这会把水硬逼过去。我们想了一切办法，消减流速，保证截流。今天最后一班，指挥部开会研究情况，如无变化，就继续干下去。大家准备着吧！”
    水情
    水情并不理想。往年流量这时已经一千秒公方以下了，打上很大的安全系数，设计流量是一千；可是今早八时流量是二千零一十。
    前几天实测水情表，真的叫人耽心。10月15日是四千三百八十。11月7日下降到一千九百八十，可是到了14日又上涨到二千三百九十。那几天陆续下雨，这雨也是近几十年所没有的。演习的日子一再延期，正式截流的日子也没法确定下来。抛投的石料准备好了，就像炮弹准备好了一样，机械也检修好了，就像大炮擦干净了一样，只等发射命令。只是13日雨仍未停，14日华阴一带有雨，河水可能上涨，15日慢慢晴开，16日又阴下去了……每个人都好像变成了水文站和气象台，关心水情，又关心天气。虽然黄河不可轻视，又有风雨助威，渴望战斗的心情却越来越高了。11月17日那天忽然晴了，不能再等了，锥子山上的落雪预示着凌汛可能提前来到，可是这一天的流量是二千零一十，比设计流量超过一倍以上。
    第一个
    谁是第一个？破土的是第一个，剪彩的是第一个，战斗的事业中，英雄是第一个。
    过去，这里有着第一个钻探的人，第一个安装吊桥的人，第一个爆破的人，第一个浇灌混凝土的人和第一个打管柱的人；可是现在谁都想做第一个截流的人。
    并不是每个人都能够直接参加截流，正像不是每部机械都能直接参加截流一样。比如财务处提出口号：给截流的工人洗衣服！只求得间接贡献出自己的力量就是无尚的光荣。吴满山是有名的风钻工，浇灌了混凝土的坝基是他们开挖的，准备截流用的大块石，是他们用手风钻钻开的；可是这一阵他最大的苦恼，莫过于不知道自己能不能直接参加截流。他报了名参加突击组，他在誓师大会上也读过决心书，因为好几百人都报了名，好几百人也都读过决心书，可见就是吴满山也不见得有这个机会。他知道只是报名靠不住的时候，就天天到团委会去，到党委会去。这样做不知他什么时候就开始了；可是别人到后来才发现他的规律：他如果是第一班，就是下午两三点钟，如果是第二班就是晚上六七点钟……反正到时候他就来了。永远重复着这几句话：“什么都准备好了，我们开过思想会，到了时候再有偏差，那弄成啥啦！”“我们只有这个要求，达不到要求，批不准我的要求，我就是有意见。”从来难不倒有决心的人，他终于成了最幸运的一个。他不但是截流突击组的组长，还是截流开始第一班。他马上穿上白色救生衣，面孔显得越黑了。他的面孔从来是像与岩石战斗过的战士那般活泼有力。
    做救护工作的甄凤仙，我在三门峡报上见过她的照片，因工作好被称为白衣战士，她也第一个来了。
    推土机手叶成，从前是官厅水库的劳动模范。这次苦战三昼夜检修机车，他像那台斯大林八十推土机一样，都是工地上的骄傲。
    也许是赵绪恒，也许是刘和（两个电铲司机），装的第一车料。这时，一辆十五吨卡车，驰过鬼门溢流桥，顺着进占公路而下。这辆车在进占口来个九十度的回车，又打倒轮退到神河边上，于是第一车料在九点五分庄严地倒入了黄河。
    第一辆汽车司机叫唐玉琦。我看见他探出车窗，回头望着渐渐上升的车厢。他虽然坐在司机座上，可是胸脯剧烈地起伏，如同他刚才自己跑过百公尺一样。
    新的人门河
    征服黄河的决心早就有了。从邓子恢副总理的报告中就开始了，从开工典礼那天就开始了。以后开挖基坑、把石头炸掉；以后又浇灌混凝土。第一期围堰一筑成，人河就成了干河。现在要截流了，被截住的主流，就要改道从梳齿中流过。什么叫截流，就是黄河主流大搬家，叫它腾出地方来，好让我们进行第二期工程。7月16日那天十二点一刻，梳齿正式过水了。过去的人门河不见了，新的人门河出现了。黄河历史从此翻开了新的一页。这是超过大禹在黄河上出现的人工的河流。新的人门河，今天迎接主流，明天又为整个发电、灌溉服务。它是在新中国中诞生的。它是在今天的工人阶级手中被驯服了的，所以它更值得骄傲。
    新的人门河的出现，就是征服黄河伟大胜利的第一步。
    截流的一昼夜过去了。第二天早阳升起的时候，整个河面上的探照灯，才随着天上的星群熄灭了。仅仅两个班共抛下石料六千多方，进占二公尺多。汽车循环良好，安全排（用钢轨做成的汽车排子）得到意外的成功。
    指挥部的下面，柴油的淡蓝色烟雾中，一个突击队的红旗迎风飘扬。一阵阵汽车声、拖拉机声从席棚的窗口透进来。谢副局长一昼夜值了两个班，他不但不疲倦，反而为顺利的工作感到兴奋。
