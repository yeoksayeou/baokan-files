According to the Hubei Daily, in the autumn harvest, the broad masses of Yingcheng County, through only five days and nights of practical and skillful work, eliminated the old-fashioned sickle for harvesting throughout the county. In five days, they manufactured more than 35,000 reapers, achieving rapid mechanization of harvesting. As a result, the county's 280,000 mu of single-season late indica rice and 130,000 mu of double-season late rice can all be harvested in just five days. In this one item alone, the county can save 400,000 labor days.

    割禾器在应城显威力
    据湖北日报消息　应城县在秋收中，广大群众只经过五昼夜的实干巧干，全县消灭了旧式镰刀割禾，五天时间制造了三万五千多部割禾器，实现了快速割禾器化。从而，全县二十八万亩一季晚粳和十三万亩双季晚稻，只要五天时间，就可全部割完。仅此一项，全县即可节省四十万个劳动日。
