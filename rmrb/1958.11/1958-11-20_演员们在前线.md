　　"Performing for the soldiers and civilians on the front lines is the most glorious and happiest thing!" This is the common sentiment of the actors who have come to the Fujian front lines to offer their performances.

　　Mei Lanfang, over sixty years old, led the famous actors of the Second Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theater, including Li Hezeng and Jiang Xinrong, from one position to another, tirelessly performing for the artillery, air force, and people of the front lines. Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians saw his "Cosmic Front" and heard his a cappella singing. One night, he performed at an artillery outpost until late at night, and the next morning, he talked with the meritorious artillery soldiers. After hearing the deeds of one meritorious company, he rushed to the company's position and sang a cappella for the heroes next to their cannons. He said that when Japanese imperialism invaded our country, he had not sung Peking Opera for many years. Now, with these fearless soldiers defending the motherland, we can sing to our hearts' content.

　　The famous Henan opera actress Chang Xiangyu brought the sentiments of the people of Henan to the small islands of Xiaodeng, Dadeng, and Wu Yu on the front lines, deeply impressing the soldiers with her and her fellow Henan opera actors' brilliant performances. She said that everything on the front lines made her unforgettable. Whenever she felt a little tired from performing several shows a day, she was energized by the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army. The famous Pingju actress Xiao Baiyu Shuang, Shandong Kuaishu performer Gao Yuanjun, Suona player Zhao Chunting, flute player Feng Zicun, and every actor who came to the front lines were moved by the revolutionary heroism and communist spirit of the soldiers and civilians there. Wherever there were heroes, they went to perform.

　　The Peking Opera actor Zhang Yunxi, who played "Sun Wukong," performed day and night at the naval base. The naval commander happily said to him: "Sun Wukong, you've made a ruckus all over the front lines!" Gao Yuanjun met his old acquaintance, air force hero Liu Yuti, at an airport. He tightly shook Liu Yuti's hand and said, "You beat the American devils to a pulp in Korea, and now you are fiercely attacking the US-Chiang air pirates..." As he spoke, he excitedly took out two small copper plates and began to talk about his newly created Kuaishu "The Power of the Silver Swallow." Under the slogan of "Learn from the heroes on the front lines," the Jiangsu Yue Opera Troupe traveled all over the coastal islands and mountains. Once, they heard that a platoon of soldiers was stationed on a mountain peak more than 1,000 meters above sea level. They quickly packed up their props, climbed mountains, and crossed ridges to perform for these dozen or so soldiers. The Cantonese Opera Troupe, whose footprints covered the front lines, performed whenever and wherever they arrived at a position. When they arrived on an island, it was almost midnight, but they still performed for the soldiers again and again. During one performance, the Han Opera actors encountered a strong wind, and the curtain was about to be blown away. The troops asked them to stop, but they said: We must learn from your heroic and tenacious spirit and persevere to the end.

　　In between performances, the actors often helped the soldiers build fortifications, wipe shells, and mend and wash their clothes. After Xiao Baiyu Shuang and Liu Lan mended the soldiers' clothes in the tunnels, they immediately ran to the top of the mountain to wipe shells, singing "Yu Tang Chun" for the soldiers as they wiped. The soldiers marked the shells they wiped and wrote a poem: "Loved ones wipe the shells, we fire them, we keep the loved ones' instructions in mind, we specialize in bombing the enemy's positions, hitting the enemy with every shot."

　　On the front lines, the actors also promptly put the most touching heroic deeds on the stage. In a month and a half on the front lines, the Shandong Lü Opera actors, in addition to performing more than 100 large and small plays for the soldiers and civilians, also wrote more than 20 scripts and more than 40 short songs. On October 10th, when they were performing at the airport, they heard the news that our brave warplanes had shot down three Kuomintang planes and immediately created a living newspaper play. Lang Xianfen, the actress who played "Li Ersao Remarries," and others rehearsed overnight and performed for the air force heroes the next day, receiving a warm welcome.

　　The actors' hard work, running around and performing day and night, greatly encouraged the soldiers and civilians on the front lines. The Second Company, Third Platoon of a certain artillery unit immediately held a meeting after hearing the news that their loved ones were coming, expressing their determination to fight a beautiful battle and offer a gift to their loved ones. As a result, before their loved ones arrived, they hit an enemy ammunition depot with five shells. After being comforted, a certain engineering unit was in high spirits and full of energy, and the progress of the project increased by 60%. (Attached picture)

    演员们在前线
    新华社前线记者集体采写
    “为前线军民演出是最光荣、最幸福的事！”这是来到福建前线慰问演出的演员们共同的语言。
    年逾花甲的梅兰芳，率领着中国京剧院二团著名演员李和曾、江新蓉等，从这个阵地，到那个阵地，不辞劳苦地为炮兵、空军和前线人民演出。成千上万军民看到了他的“宇宙锋”，听到了他的清唱。有一个夜里，他在一个炮兵驻地演到深夜，第二天清早就和炮兵功臣们交谈。当他听到一个功臣连的事迹以后，连忙赶到这个连的阵地，在大炮旁为英雄们清唱。他说，日本帝国主义侵略我国时，他就好多年没有唱京戏。现在，有这些无畏的战士保卫着祖国，我们就可以尽情的唱。
    著名豫剧演员常香玉，把河南人民的心意带到小登、大登、浯屿等前沿的小岛上，把她和她同来的豫剧演员的精采表演，深深地留在战士的心里。她说，前线的一切都使她感念不忘，每当她一天连演几场戏，感到有些累时，一想到解放军的英雄事迹，浑身的劲头就出来了。著名的评剧演员筱白玉霜，山东快书演员高元钧，唢呐演奏家赵春亭，笛子演奏家冯子存和每一个来前线的演员，都为前线军民的革命英雄主义和共产主义风格所激动。那里有英雄们在，他们就到那里演出。
    扮演“孙悟空”的京剧演员张云溪，日夜在海军基地演出，海军首长高兴地对他说：“孙悟空，你可闹遍了前线。”高元钧在某机场上见到了老相识空军英雄刘玉堤，他紧紧地握着刘玉堤的手说：“你们在朝鲜把美国鬼子打的落花流水，现在又狠狠地打击美蒋空中强盗……”说着说着，兴奋地拿出两块小铜板，说起他新创作的快书“银燕的威力”。江苏的越剧团在“向前线英雄们学习”的口号下，走遍了沿海的岛屿和高山。有一次，他们听说在一个拔海一千多公尺高的山头上，驻着一个班的战士，连忙背起道具，爬山越岭，为这十几个战士演出。足迹踏遍了前线的粤剧团，什么时候到阵地，什么时候演出。他们到一个岛上的时候，已近深夜，还为战士演了再演。汉剧演员在一次演出中遇到大风，布幕快被风吹掉了，部队请他们停止，他们说：我们要学习你们英勇顽强的精神坚持到底。
    在演出的空隙，演员们还常和战士们一起修工事，擦炮弹，替战士补洗衣服。筱白玉霜和刘兰在坑道里补好了战士们的衣服以后，马上跑到山顶上去擦炮弹，一边擦一边为战士们唱“玉堂春”。战士们把他们擦过的炮弹作了记号，并且写了一首诗：“亲人擦炮我们打，亲人的嘱咐全记下，专炸敌人的阵地，百发百中把敌杀。”
    在前线，演员们还把自己最受感动的英雄事迹，及时地搬上了舞台。山东吕剧的演员，在前线的一个半月中，除了给前线军民演了一百多场大型和小型的戏以外，还写了二十多个剧本，四十多个小唱。10月10日，他们在机场慰问演出时，听到我神勇的战鹰击落国民党飞机三架的捷报，立即编出活报剧。“李二嫂改嫁”的扮演者郎咸芬等连夜排演，第二天就给空中健儿们演出，受到热烈欢迎。
    演员们的辛勤奔波，日夜演出，大大鼓舞了前线的军民。某炮兵部队二连三班，听到了亲人要来到的消息，立即开会，表示要打个漂亮仗，向亲人献礼。结果，在亲人来以前，以五发炮弹打中敌人一所弹药库。某工程作业部队，在受到慰问后，情绪昂扬，干劲冲天，工程进度提高了60％。（附图片）
