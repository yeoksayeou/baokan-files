Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 11th. Qiu Caikang, the steel fighter who has been the object of warm concern by the people of the whole country - a worker from Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 who suffered severe burns - left the hospital yesterday to attend the Shanghai Municipal Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism. When Qiu Caikang appeared on the rostrum in a wheelchair, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause. At yesterday's meeting, Qiu Caikang was selected as an active element to attend the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism.
　　Qiu Caikang, a twenty-nine-year-old furnace chief and Communist Party member, suffered burns to 89.3% of his body from molten iron in late May of this year. According to the authoritative conclusion of capitalist countries, he should have died within seventy-two hours. However, under the loving care of the Party, the vigorous rescue efforts of medical personnel, and the support of all sectors of society, Qiu Caikang survived. After more than five months of treatment, his wounds have completely disappeared, and new skin has fully grown. Only his right foot, which was most severely burned, has not regained function in the knee and ankle joints because he could not move for fifty-seven days during skin grafting. The hospital is now using various methods of traditional Chinese and Western medicine to restore its function.
　　At yesterday's meeting, Qiu Caikang was radiant and beaming. In a loud voice, he said: I deeply thank the Party! Thank Chairman Mao! It was the Party and Chairman Mao who gave me the strength to fight and gave me a second life! My life belongs to the Party. As long as my heart is still beating, as long as I am still breathing, I will dedicate all my strength to the great cause of the Party, to socialism and communism!
　　While fighting the disease, Qiu Caikang has always been concerned about the production in his factory and the rapid construction of the motherland. He reads the Party newspaper and listens to the radio every day. When his hands were bandaged and he couldn't move, he always asked the nurse to read the newspaper to him. When the nurse was not available, he would use his mouth to turn the pages. He only has three fingers left on his right hand, two of which cannot move freely, but since the evening of the 9th, he has started practicing holding a pen and writing. He said, I cannot participate in production for the time being, but I can compile my experience and teach it to new workers.
　　During Qiu Caikang's treatment, more than two thousand letters of sympathy were sent to the hospital and factory where he was located from all over the country. An old man in his nineties personally painted traditional Chinese paintings, and Young Pioneers sent flowers and red scarves. A Soviet engineer wrote a letter on behalf of more than nine thousand employees of the entire factory to express his greetings to Qiu Caikang. More than thirty foreign guests also came to the hospital to express their sympathy. All of this was a great encouragement to Qiu Caikang.

    丘财康将到北京出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会
    新华社上海11日电　全国人民热情关怀着的钢铁战士——遭受严重烫伤的上钢三厂工人丘财康，昨天从医院出来，参加了上海市青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。当丘财康坐着双轮椅出现在主席台上的时候，整个会场沸腾起来，掌声雷动。就在昨天的大会上，丘财康被选为出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的积极分子。
    二十九岁的司炉长、共产党员丘财康，今年5月下旬，全身皮肤曾被铁水灼伤达89.3％，按照资本主义国家的权威定论，在七十二小时内就得死去。可是在党的亲切关怀、医务人员的大力抢救和社会各方面的支援下，丘财康坚强地活下来了。经过五个多月的治疗，现在他的创面已全部消失，新的皮肤已完全长好，只有烧伤情况最严重的右足，因植皮时有五十七天不能活动，膝关节踝关节尚未恢复功能。现在医院里正在用中西医的各种方法恢复它的功能。
  在昨天的大会上，丘财康容光焕发，满面笑容，以宏亮的声音讲话说：我深深感谢党！感谢毛主席！是党和毛主席给了我战斗的力量，给了我第二次生命！我的生命是属于党的，只要我的心脏还在跳动，只要我的呼吸一天不停止，我就要为党的伟大事业，为社会主义和共产主义贡献出我的全部力量。
    在与病魔搏斗中，丘财康还始终关心着自己厂内的生产和祖国一日千里的建设事业。他每天看党报和收听广播。他的手包扎着不能动弹时，总是请护士读报给他听，护士没空时，就用嘴翻报纸看。他的右手只剩下了三个指头，其中两个还不能活动自如，可是从9日晚上起，他已开始练习握笔写字了。他说，我暂时不能参加生产，但是我可以把自己的经验整理出来教给新工人。
    在丘财康治疗期间，有二千多封慰问信从国内各地寄到他所在的医院和工厂，九十多岁的老人亲自画了国画，少先队员们送来了鲜花、红领巾。苏联有位工程师代表全厂九千多职工写信来向丘财康致意。三十多个国家的外宾还到医院来慰问他。这一切对丘财康是极大的鼓舞。
