    Britain's economic situation continues to deteriorate, facing an increasingly imminent economic crisis.
    Statistics released by the government show that British industrial production, which has been largely stagnant for three years, began to decline at an increasing rate each month from the second quarter of this year. Compared to the same period last year, from May to July this year, the total value of industrial production decreased by 2.5% to 3%, August decreased by 4%, and September decreased by 4.5%. The industrial production index for the first nine months of last year was 107.5, while the index for the first nine months of this year was only 106, with the September figure preliminarily estimated at only 104 to 105 (based on a monthly average of 100 in 1954). According to "The Economist" magazine, industrial production will continue to decline in the coming months.
    
    Steel and Coal Production Decreases; Unsalable Goods Pile Up
    The production of basic heavy industries like steel and coal has declined. Steel production in the first three quarters of this year decreased by nearly one-tenth compared to the same period last year, with only 14,775,000 tons produced, compared to 16,200,200 tons in the same period last year. The decline increased month by month: the first quarter decreased by 1% compared to the same period last year, the second quarter by 10%, the third quarter by 16%, and October decreased by 17% compared to the same month last year.
    
    In September, the weekly average production of steel was 369,000 tons and pig iron was 231,000 tons; while in 1955, the weekly average steel production was 381,000 tons and iron production was 240,000 tons. It is evident that the British steel industry has regressed to the level of more than three years ago.
    
    According to an announcement by the British Ministry of Power, in the first twenty-three weeks of this year, Britain produced less than 95 million tons of coal, a decrease of approximately 5.4 million tons compared to the same period last year. Statistics also show that the average weekly coal production in the third quarter of this year was less than 3,580,000 tons, a decrease of 4% compared to the same period last year.
    
    A major reason for the decrease in steel and coal production is the decline in domestic market demand. This is evident from the continuous increase in inventory. It is estimated that in the middle of this year, the steel inventory of steel-consuming factories was 1.25 million to 1.5 million tons higher than normal levels. As of October 25, coal inventory reached a high of 36,270,000 tons, of which more than 17 million tons were unsalable, more than double the amount of unsalable coal in the same period last year. In addition, reduced exports have also affected production. For example, steel exports are currently down 20% from this time last year.
    
    Shipping Industry in Decline; Shipyards Lack Orders
    The shipbuilding industry, which is of great importance to Britain as a traditional maritime nation, has maintained an average output of approximately 3.5 million tons per quarter for several years due to sufficient orders. However, in the third quarter of this year, British shipyards began building less than 300,000 tons of ships, a decrease of 22% compared to the same period last year. New orders are decreasing continuously, while customers are canceling a large number of orders. From September last year to September this year, the British shipbuilding industry received only nearly 640,000 tons of new ship orders, a decrease of 200,300 tons compared to the same period in the previous year, while customers canceled 400,600 tons of orders during this year, nearly two-thirds of the new order tonnage. The tonnage of ships built for export fell to its lowest level in twelve years at the end of September.
    
    The crisis in the shipbuilding industry is directly related to the crisis in the shipping industry. Since the end of last year, due to the shipping slump, the tonnage of idle ships in British ports has been increasing continuously. By the spring of this year, it had risen from 82,000 tons in early July last year to more than 1 million tons, reaching the highest level since the early 1930s. In June of this year, it further rose to nearly 1.5 million tons and has remained at this alarming high level until October.
    
    Textile Mills Closing Down; Auto Industry's "Good Times" Won't Last
    The textile industry, with its outdated equipment and facing serious foreign competition, is another sector of British industry in serious crisis. According to statistics released by the Cotton Board, 284 textile factories in Britain closed down in the three years from 1955 to 1957; in the first eight months of this year, 79 textile factories closed down. In September of this year, the output of cotton and rayon cloth, cotton yarn, and rayon yarn in Britain decreased by 14% compared to the same month last year.
    
    The small car industry is in relatively good shape among British industrial sectors this year. It is a fairly important factor that supports the British economy to some extent and prevents it from falling faster. In the first eight months of this year, Britain produced 680,749 small cars, an increase of nearly one-third compared to the same period last year. However, the "boom" in small cars largely depends on exports to the United States, but the United States itself has a serious overproduction of small cars, and American automakers are trying hard to deal with British imports, so this "good time" will not last long. At the same time, demand for small cars in the British domestic market began to decline more sharply than the usual seasonal decline this summer, which is causing concern among automakers. On the other hand, in the year ending at the end of September this year, the production of trucks decreased by 5%, and the production of tractors decreased by 10%.
    
    In addition, according to official statistics, the value of machine tool production in July this year decreased by 14% compared to the same month last year, and the total amount of orders decreased by 40%. In the year up to August this year, the production of televisions, radios, and phonographs also decreased by more than 25%.
    
    Total Export Value Declines Quarter by Quarter; Unemployment Continues to Rise
    The situation is also deteriorating in foreign trade, which is of great significance to the British economy. The decline in raw material prices caused by the capitalist economic recession is producing a vicious cycle. The decline in raw material prices has weakened the import capacity of countries in the Sterling Area that export raw materials, which in turn has affected Britain's exports to these countries. This effect has already begun to manifest itself in the second and third quarters of this year. In the first three quarters of this year, the total value and volume of British exports decreased by an average of 4% compared to the same period last year, but the third quarter decreased by 7% compared to the same period last year. In the first three quarters, British exports to the Sterling Area decreased by an average of 2%; however, the period from May to August decreased by 6% compared to the same period last year, with exports to New Zealand decreasing by 20% and exports to Rhodesia and Nyasaland decreasing by 22%.
    
    The decline in production and the reduction in exports have been accompanied by a large increase in the number of unemployed. Unemployment began to rise continuously from August last year. There was a slight decrease in the summer, but it began to rise again from September this year. By mid-October this year, it had risen from 266,000 people at the end of August last year to 514,000 people, reaching the highest level in eleven years, about 50% higher than the level of unemployment officially recorded in Britain in the last ten years (about 340,000 people). Winter is usually a season of rising unemployment, and it is estimated that the number of unemployed in Britain will continue to rise in the coming months.
    
    For the British working people, this winter will undoubtedly be a particularly difficult season. The Conservative government, worried about the consequences of next year's general election, has recently taken some economic measures to stimulate production, such as lowering bank interest rates and easing installment purchases, in order to stabilize public sentiment. However, these measures not only cannot solve the fundamental contradiction between the decreasing purchasing power of the people, the shrinking domestic and foreign markets, and the relative "surplus" of production, but also cannot even delay the arrival of the economic crisis. Even the ministers of the Conservative government now cannot but admit that the increasingly approaching economic crisis is unstoppable.

    英国面临日益逼近的经济危机
    官方统计数字显示出一片暗淡景象
    英国的经济情况继续不断恶化，面临着日益逼近的经济危机。
    从官方所发表的统计数字中可以看出，三年来基本上处于停滞状态的英国工业生产从今年第二季度起开始以逐月增大的幅度下降。同去年同期相比较，从今年5月到7月，工业生产总值下降了2.5％至3％，8月份下降了4％，9月份下降了4.5％。去年头九个月的工业生产指数是一百零七点五，而今年头九个月的指数只有一百零六，其中9月份据初步估计只有一百零四到一百零五（以1954年每月平均水平为一百）。据“经济学家”杂志估计，工业生产在今后几个月中还将继续下降。
    钢铁煤炭都减产　滞销货物堆如山
    重工业的基础钢铁和煤炭工业的生产都下降了。钢产量在今年头三个季度中比去年同期减少了将近十分之一，只有一千四百七十七万五千吨，而去年同期却生产了一千六百二十万零二千吨。下降幅度是逐月增大的：第一季度比去年同期下降1％，第二季度10％，第三季度16％，10月份比去年同月已下降17％。
    9月份每周平均生产钢三十六万九千吨，生铁二十三万一千吨；而1955年的每周平均钢产量是三十八万一千吨，铁产量是二十四万吨。由此可见，英国钢铁工业已经退回到三年多以前的水平上去了。
    据英国动力部宣布，今年头二十三个星期，英国只生产了不到九千五百万吨煤，比去年同期产量减少了约五百四十万吨。另据统计，今年第三季度的平均每周采煤量不到三百五十八万吨，比去年同期下降了4％。
    钢铁和煤减产的一个主要原因是国内市场的需求下降了。这一点从存货量的不断增加上可以看出。据估计，今年年中，消费钢的工厂的钢的存货量比正常水平要高出一百二十五万到一百五十万吨。到10月25日为止，煤的存货量已高达三千六百二十七万吨，其中有一千七百万吨以上是滞销卖不出的，比去年同期的滞销煤增加了一倍多。此外，出口减少也影响到生产。例如，钢的出口目前比去年这个时候下降了20％。
    航运萧条闲船多　造船工业缺订货
    对于英国这一传统的海运国家有重要意义的造船业，几年来由于订货比较充足一直维持着平均每季度约三百五十万吨的产量。但是，在今年第三季度，英国各造船厂开始建造的船只还不到三十万吨，比去年同期下降了22％。新的订货单不断减少，而顾主们还在大量取消订货单。从去年9月到今年9月，英国造船业得到的船只新订货单只有近六十四万吨，比前一年同期下降了二十万零三千吨，而这一年中顾主们取消的订货单就有四十万零六千吨，差不多达到新订货吨数的三分之二。为出口而建造的船只吨数在9月底下降到了十二年来最低的水平。
    造船业的危机同航运业的危机直接有关。自从去年年底以来，由于航运业不景气，英国各港口闲置不用的船只吨数就不断上升，到今年春季，已由去年7月初的八万二千吨上升到了一百万吨以上，达到了1930年代初期以来的最高水平。而今年6月份更进一步上升到了接近一百五十万吨，一直到10月份为止，还保持在这一惊人的高水平上。
    纺织厂倒闭成风　汽车业“好景”不长
    设备陈旧并且面临着严重的外国竞争的纺织工业是英国工业中另一个陷于严重危机的部门。根据棉业局发表的统计数字，在1955—1957年这三年中，英国有二百八十四家纺织工厂倒闭；在今年的头八个月中，有七十九家纺织工厂倒闭。今年9月份，英国的棉布和人造棉布、棉纱和人造棉纱的产量都比去年同月下降了14％。
    今年英国各工业部门中情况较好的是小汽车工业，这是一个对英国经济多少起着支撑作用使它没有下跌更快的相当重要的因素。在今年头八个月中，英国生产了六十八万零七百四十九辆小汽车，比去年同期上升了差不多三分之一。但是，小汽车的“景气”在很大程度上是依靠对美国的出口来维持着的，而美国本身的小汽车生产有严重的过剩，美国汽车商正在竭力设法对付英国的输入，因此这种“好景”是不长的。同时，英国国内市场上对小汽车的需求在今年夏季已经开始出现比通常的季节性下降更为猛烈的下降，这正在引起汽车商的忧虑。在另一方面，在到今年9月底为止的这一年中，载重汽车产量下降了5％，拖拉机产量下降了10％。
    此外，据官方统计，今年7月份机床生产产值比去年同月下降了14％，订货总额减少了40％。到今年8月为止的一年中，电视机、收音机和留声机的生产也减少了25％以上。
    出口总值逐季降　失业人数不断增
    在对于英国经济具有重大意义的对外贸易方面，情况也在恶化。资本主义经济衰退所引起的原料价格下跌正在产生恶性循环作用。原料价格下跌打击了英镑区出口原料的国家的进口能力，这反过来又影响到了英国对这些国家的出口。这种影响已经在今年第二、三季度开始表现出来。在今年头三个季度中，英国的出口总值和总量平均比去年同期下降了4％，但是，第三季度比去年同期下降了7％。在头三个季度中，英国对英镑区的出口平均下降了2％；但是，5月到8月这一时期却比去年同期下降了6％，其中对新西兰的出口下降了20％，对罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰的出口下降了22％。
    随着生产下降和出口减少而来的是失业人数的大增。失业从去年8月份起就开始连续上升，在今年夏季曾一度有一些微少的下降，从9月份起又开始上升，到今年10月中旬已由去年8月底的二十六万六千人上升到五十一万四千人，达到了十一年来最高的水平，比最近十年来英国官方统计的失业水平（约三十四万人）高出了50％左右。冬季通常是失业增长的季节，据估计，在今后的几个月中，英国的失业人数将继续上升。
    对于英国劳动人民来说，今年冬季无疑将是一个特别困苦的季节。担心到明年大选后果的保守党政府，为了稳定人心，最近一个时期以来采取了降低银行利率和放宽赊购等一些经济措施来刺激生产，但是这些措施不但不能解决人民购买力日益降低、国内外市场日益缩小同生产量相对“过剩”之间的根本矛盾，甚至于也不能延缓经济危机的到来。就连保守党政府的大臣们现在也不能不承认，日益逼近的经济危机是无法阻挡的。
