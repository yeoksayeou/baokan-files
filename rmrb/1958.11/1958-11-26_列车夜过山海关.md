    Train Passes Through Shanhaiguan at Night
    Wang Xisheng, Liaoning University
    The train passes through Shanhaiguan at night,
    The Great Wall and mountains are not to be seen,
    The vast waves soaring into the sky are unseen,
    Only a sea of fire illuminates the red sky.
    The roar of the furnace plays a nocturnal song,
    The steel flows torrentially, displaying its mighty flames;
    Not knowing the great leap forward in iron and steel,
    One suspects it is the Flaming Mountains of the Western Heaven.

    列车夜过山海关
    辽宁大学　王喜盛
    列车夜过山海关，
    不见长城不见山，
    不见腾空万里浪，
    只见火海映红天。
    熔炉吼吼奏夜曲，
    钢水滔滔逞威焰；
    不知钢铁大跃进，
    疑是西天火焰山。
