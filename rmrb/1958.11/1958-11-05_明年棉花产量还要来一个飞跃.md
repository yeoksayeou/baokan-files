Editorial: Next Year's Cotton Production Will Take Another Leap Forward

    The National Cotton Production Conference, convened by the Ministry of Agriculture, concluded on October 29th. This was a training meeting, a mobilization rally to greet 1959 and make China's cotton production take another leap forward on the basis of the unprecedented bumper harvest in 1958.

    1958 was a year in which China's cotton production was equivalent to "twenty years in a day." If in 1957, with relatively good natural conditions, China saw five counties with a per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton, 4.21 million mu of cotton fields with a per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton, and the creation of a national record of over 1,400 jin of seed cotton per mu, it was already a great achievement. Then this year, despite unfavorable waterlogging and drought disasters, whether in the South or North, inland or border areas, high-yield or low-yield areas, the unit yield, total output, and large-scale high-yield production of cotton have all increased by one to several times compared to last year. This year, China already has ten provinces and cities with a per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton, and the cotton field area in these ten provinces and cities is 56.9 million mu. There are 47 counties and cities with a per-mu yield of 200 to 300 jin of ginned cotton, covering 10.85 million mu of cotton fields. There are 17 counties and cities with a per-mu yield of over 300 jin of ginned cotton, covering 2.77 million mu of cotton fields. The Chengguan People's Commune in Yingshang County, Anhui Province, created a world record of 2,427 jin of ginned cotton per mu on six mu of cotton fields. The unit yield and total output of cotton nationwide have more than doubled compared to last year, with the unit yield reaching around 90 jin per mu and the total output reaching over 70 million dan, far exceeding this year's cotton production in the United States. The growth rate of unit yield this year is equivalent to 40 times the annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan. Such a growth rate is unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Such a growth rate has shattered the conservative ideas of many people, such as "cotton production cannot leap forward" and "cotton production in low-yield areas cannot leap forward." Such a growth rate demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and is the result of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, liberating their minds, going all out, and conscientiously implementing the eight major measures for agricultural production increase: water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, close planting, pest and disease control, improved tools, and strengthened field management. While celebrating this year's bumper harvest of cotton production, we should advance victoriously and make cotton production in 1959 take another leap forward of the same magnitude as this year.

    The important significance of China's cotton production taking another leap forward in 1959, just like this year, lies in the fact that it can create abundant material conditions for China to complete socialist construction and transition to communism. After this task is completed, the amount of cotton per capita in China will increase from 12 jin this year to 20 to 30 jin, and the supply of cotton cloth can also be increased. This is a grand plan and a glorious task for Party committees at all levels and the vast number of commune members in cotton-producing areas.

    Continuing to go all out, striving for the upstream, and formulating advanced production increase targets are the prerequisites for ensuring another leap forward in cotton production next year. Experience proves that where politics takes command, minds are greatly liberated, and after mass debates, advanced targets are set, the enthusiasm is great, and the increase in production is also large. The experience of Xinxiang, Henan, and Siyang, Jiangsu, which increased sixfold this year, is such an example. With clear advanced targets, there can be full enthusiasm, the initiative of the masses can be mobilized, and people can be forced to liberate their minds, vigorously engage in technological revolution, and dare to think and dare to do to create miracles. Conversely, conservative targets will inevitably lead to weak measures and insufficient enthusiasm. The lesson of some areas that did not leap forward or whose leap forward was small this year fully proves this point. We should see that when formulating even greater leap forward targets for 1959, we may encounter more serious resistance from conservative ideas than in 1958. Some may say: The increase in production in 1958 was a leap forward on a relatively low production level, which was achievable. It is difficult to leap forward again in 1959 on an already high production level. However, if we analyze carefully, when Macheng in Hubei and Dunhuang in Gansu formulated leap forward plans for 1958 on the basis of a per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton in 1957, didn't some people doubt whether it was possible to increase production further at such a high yield? However, the facts have given these skeptics a ruthless rebuff, and both counties have increased by two or three times compared to 1957. Furthermore, before 1957, a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton was rare in the country, but this year there are millions of mu. Since the facts have proved that the soil has infinite potential and that production can be increased on the basis of high yields in the past, why can't there be another leap forward in 1959? Therefore, to persuade those with conservative ideas, it is still necessary to conduct a large-scale debate and use the method of presenting facts and reasoning. Putting advanced targets to the masses for discussion will surely become clearer and clearer through debate, and advanced ideas will eventually defeat backward ideas. At the same time, it must also be noted that in the case of such a bumper harvest this year, complacency may arise, with blind optimism, thinking that since there has been such a leap forward this year, it is very easy to have the same or an even greater leap forward next year, without the need for hard work and hard struggle. This is not right, and great efforts must still be made to strive for a bumper harvest next year. The eighty-one counties and cities that participated in the cotton production conference this time not only formulated large-scale high-yield targets with an average per-mu yield of 1,000 to 2,000 jin of ginned cotton but also put forward corresponding measures. This communist style of continuous revolution and eternal advancement is worth promoting.

    Breaking down the old operating procedures in cotton planting technology and vigorously carrying out the technical innovation movement is an important aspect of breaking conservative ideas and increasing cotton production. 1958 was a year of leap forward in cotton production and also a year of rapid development in cotton planting technology reform. Many old technical operations have undergone many innovations and creations. The soil has been deeply ploughed, the fertilizer has been increased, dry land has been turned into paddy fields, the density of cotton plants, the height of plants, and the number of fruit branches have all broken the old regulations and have been developed. The time for topdressing and topping has been postponed a lot compared with the past, and there have also been great creations in fertilization methods and pruning methods. These technical innovations are an important guarantee for the increase in cotton production this year. In order to complete the task of a greater leap forward next year, it is necessary to continue to vigorously carry out technical innovation on the basis of summarizing and promoting this year's advanced technical experience. The key to technical innovation lies in liberating the mind, breaking conservatism, sweeping away the old rules and regulations, and breaking out of the old circle. It should be recognized that any technical measures and advanced experiences are created by the people from practice, and production practice is always developing forward. Therefore, the technical experience of creating high yields is also developing and leaping forward with the development of production. Conservatives often use examples of individual cotton fields suffering failures due to improper technical coordination, singing a contrary tune and cursing technical innovation. We are promoters and should encourage new things. Even if some new things have some problems at the beginning, it is unavoidable. We should learn from experience, improve technology, and continue to move forward.

    Vigorously improving the cotton yield in low-yield cotton areas has a huge role in promoting the continued leap forward of cotton production nationwide. The areas with originally lower yields have seen a large increase in production this year. For example, the Yuhnan, Wanbei, Ebei, and Xuhuai areas of Jiangsu, which have always been considered low-yielding, have seen an increase in production of three to ten times or more this year. Many of these counties are already on par with the yields of high-yielding areas and high-yielding counties. Even Guizhou and Yunnan, which have always been considered to have poor cotton planting conditions, have seen counties with a per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton, such as Yinjiang, Binchuan, and Yongsheng, and in Heqing County, Yunnan, a high-yield "satellite" of 1,375 jin of ginned cotton per mu was released. These facts are very convincing for those who love to emphasize objective conditions. As long as we break the "theory of conditions" and establish a style of daring to think and daring to act, these areas can speed up their pace, catch up quickly, and in 1959, they will definitely be able to keep pace with the yields of high-yielding areas, and even surpass them.

    It should be seen that this year's great leap forward and bumper harvest of cotton have provided a solid material foundation for striving for greater production increase next year. Cadres and the vast number of masses have formed a professional team for managing cotton production and have rich experience in large-scale high-yield production. The people's communes have basically been realized throughout the country. Under the new production organization form of militarized organization, combatized production, and collectivized life, it is more conducive to implementing production increase measures, strengthening field management, and overcoming various difficulties. The large-scale deep plowing of land, soil improvement, water conservancy construction, and fertilizer accumulation and application movement this winter and next spring are also basic conditions to ensure a greater leap forward in cotton next year.

    Of course, the task of cotton production taking another leap forward in 1959 is arduous, and preparations must be made as early as possible. A mass movement to summarize this year's production increase experience and formulate a 1959 leap forward plan should be launched immediately in cotton-producing areas. Summarizing the experience of increasing production can liberate the mind, find measures to increase production, increase confidence in the leap forward, and make it easier to formulate a leap forward plan. When formulating the plan, it must be ensured that there are large-scale high-yield and high-yield fields with a per-mu yield of 500 to 1,000 jin of ginned cotton, accounting for 10% to 30% of the local cotton field area. This is a fundamental key to the cotton leap forward next year. The plan for large-scale high-yield and high-yield fields must be combined with the high-yield production of more than 70% of the general cotton fields to achieve an all-round increase in production. However, both the plan for large-scale high-yield and high-yield fields and the plan for general fields need to be formulated through repeated mass debates. Make every commune, every team, and even every commune member have their own plan, their own leap forward target, and specific measures. In particular, the new cotton areas that will expand more than 20 million mu next year must make ideological, technical, and material preparations as soon as possible. We can only thoroughly follow the mass line, hand over the task of increasing production to the vast number of commune members, widely mobilize the masses, and make a vigorous technical revolution with the collective wisdom and efforts of the masses to complete the task of doubling cotton production. Xinxiang County, Henan Province, is preparing to make a plan for cotton production next year this winter: planning the leadership force, arranging the leadership of cotton production increase at all levels; planning the labor force, establishing cotton professional teams and pest control professional teams and other organizations; planning the land, yield, and measures block by block. Hongwei People's Commune in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, proposed that on the basis of 1,300 jin of seed cotton per mu in the commune's 70,000 mu of cotton fields in 1958, it will be increased eightfold next year to become a 10,000-jin seed cotton commune and release a high-yield satellite of 50,000 jin of seed cotton per mu. Hongwei Commune's measures plan is: (1) Deeply plow the soil 1.5 feet to 3 feet; (2) Apply 300,000 jin to 1 million jin of base fertilizer per mu, and apply 5,000 jin of soil fertilizer to ensure that cotton is fully fed; eliminate three types of seedlings; (3) Build canals and dig wells to eliminate drought and flood insect disasters; (4) Implement early sowing and close planting to 7,000 plants, and promote seedling transplanting to ensure full seedlings; (5) Implement comprehensive technical measures, requiring the boll shedding rate of general cotton fields to be below 15%, with 100 bolls per plant; 200 bolls per plant in "satellite" fields. Xinxiang County's plan to make preparations as early as possible and the heroic spirit of Hongwei Commune in Gaotang County to always move forward can serve as examples for cotton-producing areas to formulate plans. Strive hard for three years. 1958 was the first battle, and 1959 was the year of the decisive battle for cotton production increase. The power of the masses is infinite. As long as we work hard and skillfully under the leadership of the Party and with the encouragement of the general line, China's cotton production will definitely be able to create even greater miracles in 1959.

### 明年棉花产量还要来一个飞跃

    明年棉花产量还要来一个飞跃
    由农业部召开的全国棉花生产会议，于10月29日闭幕了，这是一次练兵会议，是迎接1959年使我国棉花产量在1958年空前大丰收的基础上再来一个飞跃的誓师动员大会。
    1958年是我国棉花生产“一天等于二十年”的一年，如果说在自然条件较好的1957年我国出现了五个亩产百斤皮棉县、四百二十一万亩百斤皮棉田和创造了亩产一千四百多斤籽棉的全国最高纪录，已经是一个很大成绩的话，那么，今年在水旱灾害不利的情况下，不论南方和北方，内地和边疆，高产区和低产区，棉花单位产量、总产量以及大面积高额产量，都超过去年一倍到几倍。今年我国已有十个亩产百斤皮棉省市，这十个省市的棉田面积有五千六百九十万亩。亩产二百斤至三百斤皮棉的，有四十七个县市，一千零八十五万亩棉田。亩产三百斤皮棉以上的有十七个县市，二百七十七万亩棉田。安徽省颍上县城郊人民公社，在六亩棉田上创造了亩产二千四百二十七斤皮棉的世界最高纪录。全国棉花的单位产量和总产量都比去年翻了一番还多，单位产量达到亩产九十斤左右，总产量达到七千万担以上，大大超过了美国今年的棉花产量。今年单位产量的增长速度相当于第一个五年计划每年递增率的四十倍，这样的增长速度是古今中外史无前例的。这样的增长速度打破了许多人对于“棉花增产不能跃进”，“棉花增产在低产地区不能跃进”等保守思想，这样的增长速度显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性，是我国人民在党中央和毛主席领导下，解放思想，鼓足干劲，认真贯彻水、肥、土、种、密、防治病虫、改良工具和加强田间管理八项农业增产大法的结果。我们应当在庆祝今年棉花生产的大丰收的同时，乘胜前进，使1959年棉花产量再来一个同样的飞跃。
    1959年我国棉花产量再来一个同今年一样的飞跃的重要意义，就在于它可以为我国完成社会主义建设向共产主义过渡创造充裕的物质条件。这一任务完成后，将使我国每人平均占用棉花的数量从今年的十二斤提高到二、三十斤，棉布的供应数量也就可以增加。这是一个宏伟的计划，是我国棉区各级党政和广大社员的光荣任务。
    继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，制定先进的增产指标，是保证明年棉花产量再来一个飞跃的前提。经验证明：那里政治挂了帅，思想大解放，经过群众大辩论，指标定的先进，干劲就大，增产的幅度也就大。今年的河南新乡、江苏泗阳跃增六倍的经验就是如此。有了鲜明的先进指标，才能有十足的干劲，才能调动群众的积极性，才能逼着人们解放思想，大闹技术革命，敢想敢干创造奇迹。反之，指标保守，采用的措施也必然无力，干劲不足。今年有的地区产量没有跃进或跃进幅度较小的教训，充分证明了这一点。我们应当看到，在制定1959年产量更大的跃进指标的时候，还可能遇到比1958年更加严重的保守思想的阻力。可能有人会说：1958年的增产是在较低产量水平上跃进的，是可以办到的，1959年在已经高产的水平上再跃进，是难以办到的。但是我们仔细分析一下，当湖北麻城和甘肃敦煌在1957年亩产百斤皮棉的基础上制定1958年跃进计划时，不就是有人怀疑：这样的高产量再增产是办不到的么？但是，事实已给了这些怀疑派无情的回击，两县都比1957年又翻了两三番。再如，1957年以前亩产千斤籽棉在全国是凤毛麟角，而今年则出现了几百万亩。既然事实证明土壤有无穷的潜力，过去在高产的基础上可以增产，那么，1959年为什么不可以再跃进？因此，要说服有保守思想的人，仍然必须进行大辩论，采用摆事实讲道理的方法，把先进指标交给群众讨论，一定会愈辩愈明，先进思想终会战胜落后思想。同时，还必须注意到，在今年这样大丰收的情况下，也可能产生自满情绪，盲目乐观，认为今年跃进了这样多，明年再来一个同样的或者更大的飞跃都是很容易的事，不需苦战奋战了。这是不对的，争取明年的丰产还必须作很大的努力。这次参加棉产会议的八十一个县市，不仅制定了平均亩产皮棉一千斤到二千斤的大面积高产指标，而且提出了相应的措施。这种不断革命，永远向前的共产主义风格，是值得发扬的。
    破除植棉技术上旧的操作规程，大力开展技术革新运动，是打破保守思想使棉花增产的一个重要方面。1958年是棉花生产跃进的一年，也是植棉技术改革飞跃发展的一年。许多旧的技术操作都有很多的革新和创造，土壤深翻了，肥料增加了，旱田变成了水田，棉株的密度、株高、留果枝的数目，都打破了旧有的规定，并有了发展，追肥、打顶的时间比过去推迟了很多，施肥方法和整枝方法也有了很大创造。这些技术的革新是今年棉花获得增产的重要保证。为了完成明年更大的飞跃的任务，必须在总结推广今年先进技术经验的基础上继续大搞技术革新。技术革新的关键在于解放思想，打破保守，扫除清规戒律，冲出旧有的圈套。应该认识到任何技术措施、先进经验都是人民群众从实践中创造出来的，生产实践是永远向前发展的。因此创造高额产量的技术经验，也是随着生产发展而发展，跃进而跃进。保守思想者常会利用个别棉田因技术配合不当遭受失败的例子，高唱反调，诅咒技术革新。我们是促进派，对于新生的东西应该鼓励，即便有些新生的东西在开始的时候出些毛病也是难以避免的。应当吸取经验改进技术，继续前进。
    大力提高低产棉区的棉花产量，对促进全国棉花的继续跃进有巨大的作用。原来产量较低的地区今年增产的幅度很大，如过去一直认为低产的豫南、皖北、鄂北和江苏的徐淮地区，今年增产的幅度都在三到十倍以上。其中许多县已经和高产地区高产县的产量平起平坐了。就是一向被认为植棉条件差的贵州、云南也出现了像印江、宾川、永胜等亩产百斤皮棉县，而且在云南鹤庆县还放出了亩产一千三百七十五斤皮棉的高产“卫星”。这些事实对于那些爱强调客观条件的人们是很有说服力的。只要打破“条件论”，树立敢想敢干的风格，这些地区就能够快马加鞭，急起直追，1959年一定可以和高产地区的产量并驾齐驱，甚至后来者居上。
    应该看到今年棉花的大跃进，大丰收，对争取明年更大的增产提供了雄厚的物质基础。干部和广大群众，已经形成了一支管理棉花生产的专业队伍，并且有大面积高产的丰富经验。全国已基本实现了人民公社化，在组织军事化，生产战斗化，生活集体化的新的生产组织形式下，更有利于贯彻增产措施，加强田间管理，克服各种困难。今冬明春大规模的深翻土地，改良土壤，兴修水利，积肥施肥运动等，也都是保证明年棉花更大跃进的基本条件。
    当然，1959年棉花产量再来一个飞跃的任务是艰巨的，必须及早进行准备工作，立即在产棉区展开一个总结今年增产经验和制定1959年跃进规划的群众运动。总结增产经验可以解放思想，找出增产的措施，增加跃进的信心，更便于制定跃进规划。制定规划时必须保证有占当地棉田面积10％至30％的亩产皮棉五百斤到一千斤的大面积高额丰产田，这是明年棉花跃进的一个根本关键。要把大面积高额丰产田和70％以上的一般棉田丰产结合起来，达到全面增产。但是无论大面积高额丰产田的计划和一般田的计划，都需要通过群众多次辩论，制定出来。使每一个社，每一个队以至每一个社员都有自己的计划，都有自己的跃进指标和具体措施。特别是明年扩大二千多万亩棉田的新棉区及早作好思想上、技术上、物质上的准备更为紧迫。我们只有彻底地走群众路线，把增产任务交给广大社员，广泛地发动群众，群策群力大闹技术革命，棉花产量翻一番的任务才能完成。河南省新乡县准备在今冬就作好明年棉花生产的规划：规划领导力量，安排好各级棉花增产的领导；规划劳力，成立棉花专业队和治虫专业队等组织；按地逐块规划土地、产量和措施。山东高唐县宏伟人民公社提出在1958年全社七万亩棉田亩产籽棉一千三百斤的基础上，明年要翻八番，成为万斤籽棉社并放出亩产籽棉五万斤的高产卫星。宏伟社的措施规划是：（1）土壤深翻一点五尺至三尺；（2）亩施基肥三十万斤至一百万斤，追施土化肥五千斤，保证棉花吃饱喝足；消灭三类苗；（3）修渠打井消灭旱涝虫灾害；（4）实行早播，密植到七千株，并推行育苗移栽，保证全苗；（5）贯彻综合性技术措施，要求一般棉田蕾铃脱落在15％以下，每株成铃一百个；“卫星”田每株成铃二百个。新乡县及早作好准备的计划和高唐县宏伟社永远前进的豪迈气魄，都可以作为棉区制定规划的榜样。苦战三年，1958年是初战，1959年是棉花增产决战的一年。群众的力量是无穷无尽的，只要我们在党的领导下，总路线的鼓舞下，苦干巧干，奋发努力，我国的棉花生产一定能够在1959年创造出更大的奇迹。
