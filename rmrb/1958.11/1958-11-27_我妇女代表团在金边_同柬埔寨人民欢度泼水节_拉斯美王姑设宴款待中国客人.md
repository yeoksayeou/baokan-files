Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 26th – The Chinese Women's Delegation yesterday afternoon joined the Cambodian people in Phnom Penh to celebrate the Water Festival.

The three-day Water Festival celebrations began at 4:00 PM yesterday. On this day, the King and Queen of Cambodia went to the floating palace on the banks of the Tonle Sap River to watch the dragon boat races.

The Chinese Women's Delegation was invited to participate in the ceremony announcing the start of the Water Festival. Accompanied by Princess Rasmi, they sat on either side of the King and Queen in the floating palace to watch the dragon boat races.

The dragon boat races on the wide Tonle Sap River made the tens of thousands of spectators on both sides cheer. The Chinese women representatives joined the people of the Cambodian capital in applauding and cheering for the winners of the competition.

In the floating palace, a Cambodian orchestra frequently played classical music. The melodious music intertwined with the cheers from outside the palace.

The annual Water Festival is held when the dry season arrives and the crops are about to ripen. People express their gratitude to the water and soil for nurturing their grains during the Water Festival.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 26th – Cambodian Princess Rasmi held a dinner party last night to entertain the Chinese Women's Delegation. After the banquet, a soiree was also held for the Chinese guests.

In her speech, the Princess praised the role of Chinese women in national construction. She also said that now, Cambodian women are also working hard side by side with men. Cambodian women have already shown their strengths in agriculture and have made good achievements in participating in social activities and public health work.

In her reply, Zhang Qian, head of the Chinese Women's Delegation, said that Cambodian women are making increasingly important contributions to the construction of their country. She especially praised the role played by Her Royal Highness the Princess.

Zhang Qian said that Chinese women eagerly hope to visit and correspond with Cambodian women. She said that this will further increase mutual understanding, encouragement, and assistance between the women of the two countries, thereby helping to further strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries.

Female teachers and students from Cambodia performed some programs at the evening party reflecting the friendship between China and Cambodia and the history of the liberation of Cambodian women. Ma Yutao, a member of the delegation and a singer, also sang two Chinese songs.
