    Journey to the Frontier
    Guāng Wèirán
    Heroic Spirit Lingers in the Heart
  (Inscription on the Soviet-Mongolian Martyrs' Tower)
    The violent wind roars like a lion,
    Raising arms on the high hill.
    A surprise force penetrates the desert,
    Annihilating the enemy in Wolf Den Gully.
    The red star points to the Big Dipper,
    The ornamental column emerges from the clouds.
    Looking up at the Martyrs' Tower,
    Heroic spirit lingers in the heart.
    Small Note: Wolf Den Gully is north of Zhangjiakou, in a strategically important location. In 1945, the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces helped us liberate Zhangjiakou and fiercely annihilated the Japanese invaders there. Recently, I represented the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers Association to attend the Zhangjiakou area literary and art workers conference. On the day before the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution, I passed Wolf Den Gully and visited the Martyrs' Tower. At that time, the north wind roared, the snow on the top of the mountain had not melted, and the red star on the tower radiated dazzling light.
    Impromptu at Zhangyuan
    (Dedicated to the Zhangjiakou Literary and Art Exhibition Hall)
    So what if we are poor and blank!
    We have steel giant hands,
    Heroic spirit.
    The high furnace battles at night, spitting red smoke,
    Illuminating both sides of the Great Wall;
    Digging out numerous underground treasures,
    Refining a golden world;
    Surprising the south,
    Together praising the north.
    We have the newest and most beautiful pictures,
    Thousands upon thousands of poetic talents.
    Ask Du Fu and Li Bai:
    Dare you ascend the poetry contest stage,
    And compete for the best, most, and fastest?
    Journey to Zhangbei
    (Ode to the Grassland Militia)
    I came to Zhangbei to see the grassland,
    But I arrived late after the pasture had been cut.
    High furnaces spew smoke everywhere,
    The smoke is high and the land is vast, making the sky seem low.
    The north wind brushes my ears as the sun sets in the west,
    Where does the neighing of horses come from?
    I have long heard that there are fine horses in the north,
    Now is the time for cavalry drills.
    The militia on horseback are full of spirit,
    The male soldiers are brave and the female soldiers are fierce.
    At the sound of a command, dust rises,
    Like swimming dragons playing in the waves.
    Guns on shoulders and swords at waists,
    People are energetic and horses are strong.
    Eager to ride a thousand-mile horse,
    Fly straight to the East China Sea to slay the mad dragon.
    The grassland is now communalized,
    Refining iron, steel, and soldiers.
    Warhorses understand human intentions,
    Pulling grass, plows, and ore.
    Zhangbei daughters are like Mulan flowers,
    Flying on horseback like arrows;
    Dismounting and joining the steel formation,
    Dancing steel forks in the fiery mountains.
    Workers and peasants off the horse, soldiers on the horse,
    Why not lean on the saddle to write poetry?
    People have heroic feelings and horses have courage,
    Carry poetry and ride horses over the Great Wall.
    The scenery on the frontier is new every day,
    New poems and new paintings depict new people;
    New people and new things cannot be written enough,
    Ten thousand horses carry poetry to Beijing.

    塞上行
    光未然
    雄风心上留
  （题苏蒙烈士塔）
    狂飚如狮吼，
    振臂上高丘。
    奇兵穿大漠，
    歼敌狼窝沟。
    红星指北斗，
    华表出云头。
    仰望烈士塔，
    雄风心上留。
    小注：狼窝沟在张家口以北，形势险要。1945年苏蒙联军助我解放张家口，曾在此痛歼日寇。最近我代表文联、作协参加张家口地区文艺工作者大会，于十月革命四十一周年之前一日，过狼窝沟，谒烈士塔。其时北风怒吼，山顶积雪未消，塔上红星，光芒四射。
    张垣即兴
    （赠张家口文艺展览馆）
    哪怕一穷二白！
    有钢铁巨手，
    英雄气概。
    高炉夜战吐红烟，
    照亮了长城内外；
    挖出地下宝藏多，
    炼成个黄金世界；
    教江南大吃一惊，
    同夸塞北。
    有最新最美图画，
    成千成万诗才。
    问杜甫、李白：
    可敢登上赛诗台，
    比个又好又多又快？
    张北行
    （歌草原民兵）
    我来张北看草地，
    牧草割尽我来迟。
    遍地高炉喷烟雾，
    烟高地阔觉天低。
    北风掠耳日偏西，
    何处声声有马嘶？
    久闻塞北多良马，
    正是骑兵操练时。
    马上民兵意气豪，
    男兵英武女兵骁，
    一声号令风尘起，
    好似游龙戏浪涛。
    枪在肩头刀在腰，
    人有精神马有膘。
    一心跨上千里马，
    直飞东海斩狂蛟。
    草原如今公社化，
    炼铁炼钢炼兵马。
    战马俯仰如人意，
    拉草拉犁拉矿砂。
    张北女儿木兰花，
    马上飞腾如箭发；
    下马投入钢铁阵，
    火焰山里舞钢叉。
    马下工农马上兵，
    何妨倚马写诗文？
    人有豪情马有胆，
    揣诗纵马过长城。
    塞上风光日日新，
    新诗新画写新人；
    新人新事写不尽，
    万马驮诗到北京。
