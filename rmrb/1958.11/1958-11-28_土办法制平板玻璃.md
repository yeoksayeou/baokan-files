    Homemade Method for Manufacturing Flat Glass
    (Our report) The employees of Wuxi City's Hezhong Glass Factory have used a homemade method to produce flat glass, opening up a path for the widespread development of the flat glass industry.
    The Hezhong Factory's method of manufacturing flat glass requires little money, is simple to operate, and easy to learn. Furthermore, it does not require power, making it possible to build factories in areas without electricity. The main equipment consists of a tank furnace built with blue bricks and refractory bricks, and a rolling machine consisting of two rollers. A flat glass factory with an annual output of four thousand cases only requires an investment of more than two thousand yuan and can be built in one or two months.
    The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Light Industry recently held an on-site meeting in Wuxi to promote the factory's experience.

    土办法制平板玻璃
    本报讯　无锡市合众玻璃厂职工，用土办法制成平板玻璃，为平板玻璃工业遍地开花打开了一条道路。
    合众厂用土法制造平板玻璃，花钱少，操作简单，一学就会；而且不用动力，没有电力供应的地区都可以建厂。主要设备是用青砖和耐火砖砌的一座池炉，一台由两个滚轴组成的滚压机。一座年产四千箱的平板玻璃工厂只需投资二千多元，一、二个月就能建成。
    江苏省轻工业厅最近在无锡召开现场会议，推广了这个厂的经验。
