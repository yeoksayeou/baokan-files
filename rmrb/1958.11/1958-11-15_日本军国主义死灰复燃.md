    Resurrection of Organs of the Police State
    In the office building of the "Ground Self-Defense Force Staff Office" in Nerima Ward, Tokyo, Japan, there is a room without even a sign on its door. What exactly this place is has become a "mystery." However, this "mystery" has recently been revealed. During a question-and-answer session at the House of Representatives Budget Committee meeting on October 30, Socialist Party Diet member Isumi Isamu unveiled this secret. It turns out that this place harbors a "secret Special Higher Police Organization" (referring to the notorious pre-war Japanese secret police organization). The head of the room is an official from the Cabinet Investigation Office named Yamaguchi Hiroshi. This person is a veteran intelligence agent. Currently working under him are personnel dispatched from the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet's National Police Agency, Public Security Investigation Agency, and Cabinet Investigation Office. These people's names cannot be found on the government employee register. Their work is absolutely secret and rarely known to outsiders.
    After Isumi Isamu raised this matter for questioning, the Kishida Nobusuke government was speechless and extremely embarrassed, and the meeting could not continue. The reason for this is that this revelation touched Kishida Nobusuke's sore spot and exposed evidence of his intensified conspiracy to revive militarism and a police state.
    Calling Back the Soul of Militaristic Navy
    According to a report in the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun," an organization called the "Mikasa Warship Preservation Society" appeared in Japan on November 4. It is said that the initiators of this organization number about 700, requiring a working fund of 120 million yen and a maintenance fee of 80 million yen, half of which is borne by the Kishida Nobusuke government.
    The "Mikasa Warship" was a flagship of the Japanese Navy that defeated the Russian Baltic Fleet during the Russo-Japanese War. For decades, Japanese warlords have kept it in Yokosuka Port as a "symbol of the Imperial Navy" to flaunt their war achievements. After the war, the American occupation forces dismantled the masts and turrets of the "Mikasa Warship" and turned it into things like "ballrooms" and "aquatic product exhibition halls."
    For more than a decade, the war-weary Japanese people have long forgotten about it. However, now the Kishida Nobusuke government is actually sparing no effort to subsidize a group of people with national treasury expenditures to create such an organization. The purpose is clearly to call back the soul of the militaristic navy of that year and to cheer for today's "Maritime Self-Defense Force."
      Screening Belligerent Films
    According to a report in the Japanese "Akahata" newspaper, after the Kishida Nobusuke government intensified the revival of militaristic education, the education authorities of Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, issued a notice to dozens of elementary and middle schools in the prefecture to screen the film "Emperor Meiji and the Russo-Japanese War" to strengthen the effect of "visual teaching" in history classes for students.
    "Emperor Meiji and the Russo-Japanese War" is a thorough and reactionary film that promotes the "divine power" of the Emperor and the belligerent ambitions of Japanese imperialism. The Kishida Nobusuke government's open practice of instilling militaristic war education in children has aroused the indignation of the Japanese people.
  Learning Essentials for Manufacturing Cannon Fodder
    According to the "Japan News" weekly, the new "Study Guidance Guidelines" recently announced by the Kishida Nobusuke government's Ministry of Education are essentially a "guidance guideline" for manufacturing cannon fodder by dragging Japanese youth onto the road of war.
    In the old "Study Guidance Guidelines," it was clearly stipulated that teachers should explain to students the causes of war and the disasters caused by war, etc. However, the new "Study Guidance Guidelines" deleted this item. Not only that, but the new "Study Guidance Guidelines" further instill war education in students under the guise of "promoting national consciousness." For example, in the history education content for the second grade of junior high school, it is stipulated that students should be told that the Sino-Japanese (Jiawu) War (1894-1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) greatly improved Japan's international status. It is also stipulated that the Japanese invasion of China should be explained using the term "Japan's advancement into the mainland." For another example, in the music class for elementary school students, many songs with the word "soldier" in the title are specified as songs that students "love." Such as "Toy Soldier," "Eros Parade," "American Patrol," "Lead Soldier's Grand March," etc., are all included in this kind of "favorite song."
    The "Japan News" weekly also revealed that the people who drafted this "Study Guidance Guidelines," in addition to a group of pre-war Ministry of Home Affairs bureaucrats who are currently working in the Kishida Nobusuke government's Ministry of Education, also include Takayama Iwao, a reactionary intellectual who advocated nationalistic philosophy at Kyoto Imperial University during the war and tried his best to serve militaristic war.

    日本军国主义死灰复燃
    万峰
  　复活警察国家的机关
    在日本首都东京练马区“陆上自卫队幕僚监部”的办公大楼里，有这么一所房子，它的门口连块牌子也没有，这里究竟是个什么所在已经成了“谜”。可是，最近这个“谜”终于被揭穿了。社会党国会议员今澄勇，在10月30日众议院预算委员会会议上进行质询时，揭开了这个秘密。原来这里窝藏着一个“秘密的特高组织”（即臭名远扬的战前日本秘密警察组织）。担任室长的是山口广志内阁调查室的官员。此人是个特务老手。现在在他手下工作的，全是岸信介内阁的警察厅、公安调查厅和内阁调查室派来的人。这些人的名字在政府职员登记册上是找不到的。他们的工作绝对秘密，很少被外人知道。
    今澄勇提出这件事进行质询后，岸信介政府无言以对，弄得十分尴尬，连会都开不下去了。其所以这样，是因为这个揭发触到了岸信介的痛处，暴露了他加紧复活军国主义和警察国家阴谋的一个证据。
  为军国主义海军招魂
    据日本“读卖新闻”报道，11月4日日本出现了一个叫做“三笠舰保存会”的组织。据说，这个组织的发起人约七百人，所需工作费一亿二千万日元、维持费八千万日元，这些费用的一半由岸信介政府负担。
    “三笠舰”是日俄战争时期击溃俄国波罗的海舰队的日本海军的一艘旗舰。日本军阀为了夸耀战功，几十年来一直把它作为“帝国海军的象征”保存在横须贺港。战后，美国占领军拆除了“三笠舰”上的桅杆和炮塔，把它变成了“舞厅”和“水产展览馆”一类的东西。
  　十几年来厌恶战争的日本人民，早已把它忘干净了。可是，现在岸信介政府居然不惜工本以国库开支来资助一批人，搞出这么一个组织。其目的显然是要为当年的军国主义海军招魂，给今天的“海上自卫队”打气。
      上映好战的影片
    据日本“赤旗报”报道，在岸信介政府加紧复活军国主义教育以后，日本茨城县的教育当局通令县内数十所中小学校上映影片“明治天皇和日俄战争”，以加强对学生的历史课“直观教学”的效果。
    “明治天皇和日俄战争”是一部彻头彻尾宣扬天皇“神威”和日本帝国主义好战野心的反动影片。岸信介政府这样公开地向儿童灌输军国主义战争教育的作法，引起了日本人民的愤慨。
  制造炮灰的学习要领
    据“日本新闻”周报揭露，不久前岸信介政府文部省公布的新的“学习指导要领”，实质上是一个为把日本青少年拖上战争道路而制造炮灰的“指导要领”。
    在旧的“学习指导要领”中曾经明确规定，教员要向学生阐明战争的起因以及战争所引起的灾难等等。但是，新的“学习指导要领”中却把这一条删掉了。不仅如此，新的“学习指导要领”更以“发扬民族意识”为幌子，向学生们灌输战争教育。例如，在中学二年级历史教育内容这一项里，规定要向学生说明中日（甲午）战争（1894至1895年）和日俄战争（1904至1905年）大大提高了日本的国际地位。还规定用“日本向大陆进出”的说法来解释日本对中国的侵略行为。再如，在小学生的音乐课方面，规定了许多题目中带有“兵”字样的歌曲，作为学生“爱好”的歌曲。诸如“玩具兵”、“爱神阅兵式”、“美国巡逻兵”、“铅兵大行进”等等，都被列入这种“爱好曲”之中。
    “日本新闻”周报还揭露，起草这个“学习指导要领”的人，除了现在岸信介政府文部省里工作的一批战前内务省官僚外，还有战时在京都帝国大学鼓吹国家主义哲学，极力为军国主义战争效劳的反动文人高山岩男。（附图片）
