    Construction Industry Launches Revolution
    Rapid Construction is the Key
    (Xinhua News Agency, 9th) The rapid construction experience exchange conference held by the Ministry of Construction Engineering, which opened in Baotou, and subsequently included field visits to Taiyuan and Beijing, closed in Tianjin on the 6th. The conference summarized a complete set of rapid construction experiences.
    Next year, China's investment in capital construction will exceed the total investment of the First Five-Year Plan. This requires the construction sector to overcome difficulties such as insufficient construction and installation forces, building materials, construction machinery, and transportation capacity, and comprehensively improve construction speed. This year, employees in the national construction system have been launching rapid construction "satellites." According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,000 projects nationwide have implemented rapid construction methods. Now, the construction time for small projects of several thousand or several hundred square meters is calculated in days or hours. "Miracles" of building a house in a few hours have continuously emerged in Beijing, Shanghai, the Northeast, and other places. The implementation of rapid construction not only accelerates the speed of construction by several times or even more than ten times, enabling projects to be put into production and use ahead of schedule, but also comprehensively achieves more, faster, better, and more economical results. The quality of rapid construction projects is also very good. In Henan and Liaoning, the quality of more than 200 projects using rapid construction all met the design requirements, with 90% of the projects reaching first-class quality.
    The achievements of rapid construction are the result of engineering prioritization under the leadership of local Party committees, implementing political command, fully mobilizing the masses, vigorously engaging in technological revolution, and reforming outdated rules and regulations. This year, employees in various regions have proposed more than 2 million technical innovation proposals, improved and created 765 new tools, overcoming the obstacles of backward tools hindering construction speed, and greatly improving labor productivity. The wooden derrick created by Shanghai construction workers can lift large components weighing more than ten tons to a height of more than 20 meters, solving the difficulty of hoisting house components in rapid construction. According to incomplete statistics from 22 provinces, construction enterprises have built more than 3,200 factories themselves, smelting iron and steel, manufacturing machinery, and producing building materials, producing more than 120 kinds of products, which timely supplied the urgently needed raw materials in rapid construction. Various regions have also created complete sets of prefabricated assembly, three-dimensional intersection, and parallel flow construction methods, organized mixed work teams, and strengthened cooperation between work types and work groups, which improved the construction speed.
    This conference summarized and promoted various methods and experiences of rapid construction for various projects. Representatives also visited more than 20 construction sites and watched construction performances of different projects, making the experiences exchanged at the conference more specific, rich, and complete. Rapid construction is a revolution in China's construction industry. In the future, the construction system must take rapid construction as the key, vigorously engage in technological revolution, diversify operations, and launch mass movements to achieve a large-scale harvest on the capital construction front.

    建筑工业闹革命
    快速施工是条纲
    据新华社9日讯　建筑工程部召开的快速施工经验交流会议，在包头开幕以来，一路经过太原、北京现场参观，6日在天津闭幕。会议总结了一套完整的快速施工经验。
    我国明年基本建设投资将比第一个五年计划的总投资还要多。这就要求建筑部门克服建筑安装力量、建筑材料、施工机械和运输力量等不足的困难，全面提高施工速度。今年，全国建筑系统的职工们大放快速施工“卫星”。据不完全统计，全国已有一千多项工程推行了快速施工法。现在，一个几千、几百平方公尺的小工程，施工时间是以天、小时来计算了。北京、上海、东北等地，都不断出现几个小时就建成一幢房子的“奇迹”。实行快速施工，不仅使施工的速度加快了几倍以至十几倍，使工程提前投入生产和使用，而且能够全面达到多快好省。快速施工的工程质量也很好，河南、辽宁采用快速施工的二百多项工程，质量全部合乎设计要求，其中90％的工程质量达到一级优良品。
    快速施工取得的成就，是各地党委领导下进行工程排队，实行政治挂帅，充分发动群众，大搞技术革命，改革旧的规章制度的结果。今年，各地职工提出了二百多万件技术革新倡议，改良和创造的新工具达七百六十五种，克服了工具落后妨碍施工速度的障碍，大大提高了劳动生产率。上海建筑工人创造的木制扒杆，能把十几吨重的大构件提升到二十多公尺高，解决了快速施工中吊装房屋构件的困难。据二十二个省不完全统计，建筑企业自建了三千二百多个工厂，自炼钢铁，自造机械，自产建筑材料，产品达一百二十多种，及时供应了快速施工中迫切需要的原材料。各地还创造了成套的预制装配、立体交叉、平行流水的施工法，组织混合工作队，加强工种之间、工组之间的协作，提高了施工速度。
    这次会议总结和推广了各种工程快速施工的方法和经验，代表们还参观了二十几个施工现场，看到不同工程的施工表演，使会议交流的经验更具体、丰富、完整。快速施工是我国建筑业的一个革命，今后，建筑系统要以快速施工为纲，大搞技术革命，多种经营，大搞群众运动，使基本建设战线上获得大面积丰收。
