Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 14th: The people of all nationalities in the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, have extensively carried out large-scale production collaboration, promoting the development of socialist ethnic relations.

This autonomous prefecture is inhabited by more than ten nationalities, including Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, and Han. During the Great Leap Forward, people of all nationalities eagerly requested to break down ethnic and regional boundaries and carry out mutual assistance and collaboration in production. According to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward and the demands of people of all nationalities, Party committees at all levels promptly organized large-scale collaboration among various nationalities, between border areas and the interior, and between mountainous areas and plains areas. This included support for labor, as well as mutual assistance with livestock, seedlings, and agricultural tools. According to incomplete statistics, there were more than 50,000 instances of labor collaboration throughout the prefecture, with more than 300,000 people participating, totaling 20 million workdays.

Large-scale production collaboration greatly facilitated economic and cultural exchanges between various nationalities. Many minority nationalities learned advanced farming techniques through collaboration. This year, Dai areas such as Longchuan and Ruili encountered unprecedented severe drought in decades. Due to the vast land and sparse population, abandonment of fields was imminent. At this time, Han farmers from Tengchong, Longling and other places, despite their own heavy transplanting tasks, still sent a collaborative force of more than 2,000 people day and night, traveling from two to three hundred miles away to help with transplanting. They taught many Dai farmers the advanced technique of triangular planting. In the past, the Dai people in Longchuan County were not accustomed to cutting hard grass, and the Dai people in Yingjiang County originally did not know how to deep plow using plows. After the help of the collaboration teams, they learned these skills. The core members of the participating collaborative townships and communes also helped minority nationality agricultural cooperatives arrange work and improve management. Han farmers also earnestly learned the advanced production experience of minority nationalities. At the same time, Tengchong and other counties sent a large number of technicians and laborers to help border areas train technical personnel in mining, smelting and other skills. The first batch of tractors and cutting machine tools allocated by inland counties were first equipped in farm tool factories in remote counties. Minority areas also gave priority to the supply of coal, grain, leather and other materials to the inland. This large number of collaborations has linked the socialist economy of the entire prefecture into an indivisible whole.

Through large-scale production collaboration, the feelings of the people of all nationalities have become even deeper as they eat, sleep, and work together. When Han farmers arrived in Dai villages, the Dai people greeted them enthusiastically by playing ivory drums, vying to have Han farmers live in their homes, slaughtering pigs and chickens, and treating them like relatives. During labor, the Dai people did not allow the Han people to drink raw water, and brought tea to the fields. They sang folk songs together and competed with each other. When the collaboration team completed its task and returned to their hometown, every Dai household invited the Han people to eat unity meals together, held unity get-togethers, sent thank-you red flags, and gave beloved towels, clothes, and mangoes, pineapples and other gifts to the Han people, escorting the collaboration team ten miles away, and also singing touching songs such as "Small villages are connected, easy to connect but difficult to separate. Thousand-year-old vines entwine ten-thousand-year-old trees, trees entwine vines that will never separate." They no longer called the Han people "Han people," but called them "Han elder brothers" or "Han relatives." Many Han people in the interior are now rushing to join the collaboration teams and go to help minority nationalities make progress together.

### 藤绕树树绕藤　各民族共繁荣  德宏傣族景颇族自治州各民族广泛协作

    藤绕树树绕藤　各民族共繁荣
    德宏傣族景颇族自治州各民族广泛协作
    新华社昆明14日电  云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州各族人民广泛开展生产大协作，促进了社会主义民族关系的发展。
    这个自治州聚居着傣、景颇、傈僳、汉等十多种民族。在大跃进中，各族人民迫切要求打破民族和地区界限，生产上进行互助协作。各级党委根据大跃进的新形势和各族人民的要求，及时在各民族之间、边疆与内地、山区与坝区，组织了大协作。其中有劳动力的支援，也有耕畜、秧苗、农具等物质的相互帮助。据不完全统计，全州仅劳动力的协作就有五万多次，参加协作的达三十多万人，二千万个劳动日。
    生产大协作大大有利于各民族之间经济、文化的交流。许多少数民族在大协作中学会了先进的耕作技术。陇三、瑞丽等傣族地区今年遇到了数十年来未有的严重干旱，因地多人少，眼看抛荒。这时，腾冲、龙陵等地的汉族农民，虽然本身栽插任务繁重，还是星夜派出二千多人的协作大军，从二三百里外赶去帮助插秧。他们教会许多傣族农民掌握了三角丛植的先进技术。陇川县傣族过去的习惯是不砍硬草，盈江县傣族原来也不会深耕掌犁技术，经过协作队的帮助，都学会了。参加协作的乡社骨干，还帮助少数民族农业社安排活路，改进经营管理。汉族农民也认真学习少数民族的先进生产经验。同时，腾冲等县派出大批技术人员和劳动力，帮助边沿地区训练采矿、冶炼等技术人材。内地县份以配制的第一批拖拉机和切削机床，首先装备了边远县的农具厂。少数民族地区也以煤、粮食、皮革等物资优先供应内地。这种繁多的协作，把全州的社会主义经济联成为不可分割的整体。
    经过生产大协作，各族人民在同吃同睡同劳动中，感情更加深厚了。当汉族农民到达傣族农村时，傣族人民敲着象牙鼓，倾寨相迎，争着要汉族农民住在自己家里，杀猪宰鸡，待如亲人。在劳动中，傣族不让汉族喝生水，把茶水挑到田间。他们一起对唱山歌，相互竞赛。当协作队完成任务回乡时，傣族家家户户邀请汉族在一起吃团结饭，开团结联欢会，送感谢红旗，把心爱的毛巾、衣服和芒果、菠萝等送给汉族，把协作队送到十里外，还唱出“小小寨子穿连起，穿连容易拆散难。千年藤子绕着万年树，树绕藤子永不分离”等感人的歌。他们也不再称汉族为“汉人”了，而称“汉族大哥”或“汉族亲戚”。许多内地的汉族人民，现在争先恐后地参加协作队，前往帮助少数民族一起跃进。
