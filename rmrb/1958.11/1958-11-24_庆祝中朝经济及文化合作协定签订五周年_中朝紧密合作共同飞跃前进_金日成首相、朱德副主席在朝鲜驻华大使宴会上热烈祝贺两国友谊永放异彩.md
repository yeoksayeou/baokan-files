"Today, the peoples of our two countries are closely united in the East, firmly guarding the position of Eastern peace." Premier Kim Il-sung finally affirmed: "We will further develop this mutual assistance and cooperation relationship between our two countries and further develop mutual assistance and cooperation with countries in the socialist camp, so as to develop our people's economy and improve our people's lives at a speed that imperialism can never catch up with."

In his speech, Vice Chairman Zhu De first recalled the generous assistance and great support consistently given by the Korean brothers in the cause of our people's revolution and construction. He said that the victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the long-term, self-sacrificing assistance given by the fraternal Korean people. Vice Chairman Zhu especially pointed out that the war waged by the Korean people against American aggression not only defended the independence and honor of their motherland, but also defended the security of the People's Republic of China and the entire socialist camp, and defended peace in the Far East and the world.

Vice Chairman Zhu praised the Korean people's care and concern for the Chinese People's Volunteers, saying that the Korean people's brotherly love for the Chinese people is as high as the mountains and as deep as the sea, and the Chinese people will never forget it. The Korean people's lofty internationalist friendship with the Chinese people will shine forever in human history and compete with the sun and moon for glory.

Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out that with the liberation of northern Korea and the victory of the Chinese revolution, the peoples of China and Korea have entered a new era of comprehensive cooperation and mutual assistance, especially the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed five years ago, which has promoted and will continue to promote the common upsurge and prosperity of our two countries' socialist economy and culture.

Vice Chairman Zhu finally said that the friendship and cooperation between our two countries and the friendship and cooperation between all countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will continue to be consolidated and strengthened.
