Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 21st. (By our reporter Wang Yuzhang) The Korean working class, riding the "Chollima" (Thousand-Li Horse), has recently launched a large-scale production increase upsurge in order to accelerate the realization of the grand goal of developing industry proposed by Premier Kim Il-sung at the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, resulting in a miraculous comprehensive great leap forward on the Korean industrial front.

Currently, the output of various factories and mines in Korea is rapidly increasing month by month. Various new industrial products, from automobiles and tractors to ball bearings and fiberglass..., are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain from factories large and small throughout northern Korea.

At the same time, Korean workers are also preparing for an even greater leap forward next year. Steelworkers are determined to produce more than one million tons of iron and eight hundred thousand tons of steel next year, which is a full doubling of this year's steel production. Korean newspapers recently reported that many factories and mines will increase their labor productivity and output by one to two times compared to this year.

After the war, Korea's industry recovered and developed rapidly. Last year, Korea's total industrial output value increased by 44% compared to the previous year, but this is considered very ordinary compared to the current rate of leap forward. Now is truly an era of riding the "Chollima" in Korea's economic development.

The production increase upsurge launched by the Korean working class began in early October this year when Korean workers widely discussed a letter from the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea to all party members. This letter called on all party members and working people to strive to achieve the grand goal proposed by Premier Kim Il-sung as soon as possible—to reach 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 25 million tons of coal, 4 million tons of pig iron and granulated iron, 3 million to 3.5 million tons of steel, and 500 million meters of cloth within six or seven years...

Encouraged by this grand goal, the labor enthusiasm of the Korean working class has soared unprecedentedly. Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, workers have first vigorously promoted mechanization and automation in production, broken the shackles of machine design capabilities, and strived to tap the potential of machinery and equipment as much as possible, so that machines large and small in factories large and small can turn faster for the rapid arrival of socialism. Increasing the temperature of blast furnaces from 650 degrees to 900 degrees and 1,000 degrees, increasing the speed of spinning machines from 9,000 revolutions per minute to 15,000 revolutions per minute... such examples are constantly emerging in various factories. The reporter saw such an example at the Pyongyang Rubber Factory: workers improved the operation methods of the machines and adjusted the procedures, which greatly increased the daily output, thereby enabling the factory to produce 4.5 times as much product next year without increasing manpower.

The Korean Workers' Party's instruction on breaking the superstitious belief in the "mystification" of industry has opened the treasure house of the working people's wisdom. The reporter saw the first Korean tractor manufactured by ordinary workers at the Kiyang Agricultural Machinery Factory. It was previously considered unimaginable by some people that this factory, which could only produce simple agricultural machinery, could manufacture tractors. However, under the leadership of Kang Jong-kyung, the director of the trial production workshop of this factory, the workers built the first Korean tractor in just over two months. The factory has decided to produce 3,500 such tractors next year.

Like the process of manufacturing tractors, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, Korean workers have made automobiles, motorcycles, and excavators with their own hands, and made rayon from corn stalks and straw.

Kim Kum-san, an old worker who participated in the manufacture of the first Korean tractor, once said: "We can even make airplanes. Today, no matter what it is, we Korean workers can make it!" The countless miracles that have appeared on the Korean industrial front are being created by the industrious hands of such heroic figures.

    英雄跨上千里马　增产奇迹滚滚来
    朝鲜工业全面大飞跃
    据新华社平壤21日电　本社记者王玉章报道：骑上了千里马的朝鲜工人阶级为了加速实现金日成首相在庆祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立十周年时提出的发展工业的宏伟目标，最近掀起了一个大规模的增产高潮，使朝鲜的工业战线上出现了一个奇迹似的全面大飞跃。
    目前，朝鲜各厂矿的产品产量逐月迅速增加。各种新的工业产品，从汽车、拖拉机到滚珠轴承、玻璃丝……，正像雨后春笋一样，从朝鲜北部各地大大小小的工厂里生产出来。
    与此同时，朝鲜的工人们还在为明年的更大的跃进进行准备。钢铁工人们决心要在明年生产一百多万吨铁和八十多万吨钢，即比今年的钢铁产量整整增加一倍。朝鲜报纸最近报道了许多厂矿明年的劳动生产率和产量都要比今年增加一倍到两倍的消息。
    战后，朝鲜的工业恢复发展得很快。去年，朝鲜的工业总产值比前年增加了44％，但是同现在这种飞跃的速度比起来。就算很平常了。现在真是朝鲜经济发展上的跨上“千里马”的时代。
    朝鲜工人阶级掀起的这个增产高潮，是从今年10月初朝鲜工人广泛讨论朝鲜劳动党中央给全体党员的一封信时开始的。这封信号召全体党员和劳动人民为早日实现金日成首相提出的宏伟目标——在六、七年内使电力达到二百亿度、煤炭二千五百万吨、生铁和粒铁四百万吨、钢三百万吨到三百五十万吨、布五亿公尺……而努力。
    在这个宏伟目标的鼓舞下，朝鲜工人阶级的劳动热情空前高涨。工人们在劳动党的领导下，首先在生产中大力推行机械化和自动化，打破机器设计能力的束缚，尽可能地挖掘机器设备的潜力，使大大小小的工厂里的大大小小的机器都为社会主义的迅速到来而更快地转动起来。高炉的温度从六百五十度提高到九百度、一千度，纺纱机从每分钟九千转提高到一万五千转，……这样的事例不断在各个工厂中出现。记者在平壤橡胶厂看到了这样的实例：工人们改进了机器的操作方法和调整了工序，使得日产量大大增加，从而使这个厂可以在明年在不增加人力的情况下生产等于今年的四点五倍的产品。
    朝鲜劳动党关于破除工业“神秘化”的迷信的指示，打开了劳动人民的智慧的宝库。记者在岐阳农业机械厂看到了普通工人制造出来的朝鲜第一辆拖拉机。这个原来只能生产简单的农业机械的工厂制造出拖拉机，在过去被一些人认为是不可想像的。但是在这个厂的试制车间主任康宗敬的领导下，工人们在仅仅两个多月的时间内，就造出了朝鲜的第一架拖拉机。这个厂已经决定要在明年生产三千五百辆这样的拖拉机。
    像制造拖拉机的过程一样，在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，朝鲜工人已经用自己的双手制成了汽车、摩托车、掘土机，并且用玉蜀黍秸和稻草制成了人造丝。
    参加制造朝鲜第一辆拖拉机的老工人金锦山曾经说：“就是飞机我们也能制造，今天，不管是什么，我们朝鲜工人都能够制造出来！”在朝鲜工业战线上出现的无数奇迹正是在这样的英雄人物的勤劳的双手中创造出来的。
