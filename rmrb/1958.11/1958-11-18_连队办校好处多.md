We investigated the issue of companies running schools—companies running middle schools—in Artillery Unit 9507. From their experience, running schools in companies is a powerful measure to improve the cultural level of cadres in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. This path can greatly shorten the time for on-the-job cadres to master culture. It is possible to strive to enable the majority of our army's worker-peasant cadres to reach the level of junior middle school graduation in two major courses, mathematics and language, in batches within one to two years.

Cadres urgently need culture
What the cadres feel most deeply is that a low cultural level limits the improvement of artillery technology and work ability. Especially in artillery shooting training, because of poor math knowledge, calculations are slow and often wrong; they can only memorize formulas without understanding why they are calculated this way, so they cannot be used flexibly, draw inferences from one example, and are easy to forget. Among cadres, it is a common distress to be unable to explain the reasoning behind their work, find experience, or write summaries. The rectification movement since last year and the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country and the army this year have made the contradiction between the cultural level of cadres and military and political training more prominent, prompting cadres to urgently demand improvement.

Running Schools in Companies Has Many Advantages
In early July, the Second Company boldly established a Red and Expert School, in which a junior high school class was set up. The company commander served as the principal, and an intern platoon leader and a soldier were hired as algebra teachers, and the deputy political instructor served as the language teacher, and learning began. Running a middle school in a company is a bold and daring initiative, a mass-line education method of making drastic cuts, breaking with convention, and getting everyone involved. The first problem encountered in running a school was the issue of teachers, which they solved by trusting and relying on the masses. Running a school also encountered the problem of a lack of experience in running schools, but they emphasized getting started, creating experience in practice, and relying on the masses to solve contradictions, instead of waiting and watching. This broke the sense of mystery and inferiority about running schools in companies.

The company school adopted a variety of teaching forms. There are formal teaching classes of three or four people to eight or nine people, which is the main form. There are also self-study groups of two or three people, focusing on self-study, supplemented by mutual teaching and learning, and tutoring by small teachers. Cadres with a junior high school graduation level or above and those who are away from the company take the method of individual self-study and branch inspection. Classes in each company are held in spare time, and some classes are also held during the time when soldiers take cultural lessons. Not long after the company school started, it showed four major advantages:

First, it can effectively solve the "contradiction between work and study" and ensure and increase study time. In the past, the number of students attending the regimental night school was always limited, with the highest attendance rate reaching 50%. The time for running schools in companies is arranged by the company itself, and study time is reserved in advance when planning work. If something happens at that time and you cannot attend class, you can postpone it and find time to make it up.

Second, the number of people enrolled is large. The regimental night school has few classes and limited levels. "The courses I want to study are not available at the regimental night school; the courses available at the regiment cannot be attended." Companies can offer a variety of classes according to the different needs and levels of cadres, and adopt different forms to persist in learning.

Third, small classroom teaching in the company is convenient for teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, connecting with reality, teaching quickly, and learning thoroughly. If students easily understand something, it is explained quickly; if it is difficult, it is explained in detail; if students do not understand, they can ask questions on the spot and study it; if they already know it, it can be skipped. This method of teaching from reality, which can be increased, decreased, accelerated, or slowed down, is difficult to achieve in large teaching classes in regimental schools.

Fourth, the company school has the direct leadership of the Party branch, which can give play to the role of the Party in managing cadres, and the leadership is greatly strengthened compared to the regimental school. In the past, the company did not care when cadres went to the regimental school to study, but now the branch takes full control of the cadres' Red and Expert studies, often supervising, inspecting, and comparing, which is conducive to maintaining the regularity of learning and achieving good results.

Learn what you need
In teaching, each company emphasizes learning for application, focusing on key points. In terms of courses, focusing on the needs of artillery cadres, most currently study algebra and arithmetic, and some also study language. Some companies have made necessary deletions to the original textbooks compiled and printed by the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army in light of the characteristics of adults and the existing level of understanding of cadres. We believe that this principle of learning what you need and learning what you lack is correct. Therefore, in terms of curriculum setting, different services and arms and different cadres may not be completely the same, and the more cumbersome, repetitive, and easy-to-understand parts of the original textbook should be allowed to be deleted as necessary. Some texts can be selected and compiled by each unit.

The leadership of the regiment must keep up
Running schools in companies does not reduce the responsibility of the regimental and battalion leaders. At present, running schools in companies has raised many new issues. For example, teachers lack teaching experience and urgently need training, organizing mutual assistance and cooperation, and exchanging teaching experience; the school work of each company is developing unevenly, and it is necessary to evaluate in a timely manner, grasp the two ends and bring along the middle; how the curriculum content should be added or deleted requires the leadership to do more research and guidance; and conducting assessments at each level to ensure teaching quality, etc., all need to be considered and resolved by the leadership organs above the regiment.

    连队办校好处多
    姜思毅  张平  王晓旭
    我们在炮兵9507部队考察了连队办校——连队办中学问题。从他们的经验看来，连队办校是一条多、快、好、省地提高干部文化水平的有力措施。走这条道路可以大大缩短在职干部掌握文化的时间，有可能争取在一年到两年的时间内，使我军广大工农干部在数学、语文二门主要课程上分批达到初中毕业的程度。
  干部迫切需要文化
    干部们感觉最深的是文化低限制了炮兵技术和工作能力的提高。尤其在炮兵射击训练中，因为数学知识差，计算很慢，常常出错；只能死记公式，不懂为什么这样算，因此便不能灵活运用，举一反三，并且容易忘。在干部中，作了工作讲不出道理，找不出经验，写不出总结，是普遍的苦恼。去年以来的整风运动和今年全国全军大跃进的形势，使干部文化水平与军政训练不相适应的矛盾更加突出了，促使干部迫切要求提高自己。
    连队办校好处多
    7月上旬，二连大胆举办了一个红专学校，在这个学校里设立了初中班。以连长为校长，聘请一个实习排长和一个战士当代数教员，副政指当语文教员，开始了学习。连队办中学是一件敢想敢做的创举，是一种大刀阔斧、打破常规、大家动手的群众路线的教育方法。办校首先碰到的是教员问题，他们采用相信群众、依靠群众的办法解决了。办校还碰到缺乏办校经验的问题，但是他们强调的是上马，是在实践中创造经验，依靠群众解决矛盾，而不再等待、观望，这样便打破了对连队办校的神秘感和自卑感。
    连队学校采取了多种多样的教学形式。有三、四人至八、九人的正规的教学班，这是主要形式。还有二、三人组成的自学小组，以自修为主，辅以互教互学，小教员辅导。具有初中毕业以上水平的干部和外出人员，则采取个人自修、支部检查的办法进行学习。各连上课都在业余时间，在士兵上文化课的时间也上一些课。连队办校开始不久，就显示它有四大优越性：
    第一，能够有效地解决“工学矛盾”，保证和增多学习时间。过去团夜校到课人数始终有限，到课率最高达50％。连队办校时间由连队自行安排，在计划工作时即预先留出学习时间。到时有事，不能上课，也可以向后顺延找时间补上。
    第二，入学的人数多。团办夜校班次少程度有限制。“想学的课团里夜校没有；团里有的又去不了。”连队办校可以根据干部不同的需要和程度开设多种班次，采用不同形式坚持学习。
    第三，连队小课堂教学便于因人施教，联系实际，教得快，学得透。学员容易领会的，就讲快点；困难的，就详细讲；学员听不懂时，可以当场提问，研究一下；已经会了的，就略过去。这种可增、可减、可快、可慢的从实际出发进行教学的方法，团校的大教学班是难以做到的。
    第四，连队学校有党支部的直接领导，可以发挥党管干部的作用，比之团校，领导也大大加强了。过去干部去团校学习，连里不管，现在支部把干部的红专学习全部掌管起来，经常督促、检查、评比，利于保持学习的经常性和取得好的成绩。
    需要什么学什么
    各连教学中，都强调学以致用，抓住重点。课程上针对炮兵干部的需要，目前大部分学代数和算术，有的兼学语文。有些连队根据成年人的特点和干部已有的理解程度，对总政宣传部编印的原有教材，作了必要的删节。这种需要什么学什么，缺少什么学什么的方针，我们认为是正确的。因此在课程设置上，不同兵种、不同干部可以不尽一致，原有教材中比较繁琐、重复以及成年人容易理解的部分，应当允许下边作必要的删节。有些课文，可以由各单位自选自编。
  团的领导要跟上去
    连队办校，并不减轻团营领导的责任。目前，连队办校提出了许多新问题。例如：教员缺乏教学经验，迫切要求培养，组织互助协作，交流教学经验；各连的学校工作发展不平衡，需要及时评比，抓两头带中间；课程内容应当如何增删，需要领导上多做研究指导；以及按级进行考核，保证教学质量等等，都是需要团以上领导机关考虑解决的。（原载11月6日解放军报）
