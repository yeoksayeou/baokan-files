    Dog Life Insurance
    Poem by Tian Ma, Painting by Miao Di
    Reported: Recently, a company specializing in insuring "dog lives" was established in the United States. The insurance premium for each dog is as high as $5,000.

    Drunk and full with nothing to do,
    The masters and mistresses seek amusement,
    Britain once held a banquet for all beasts,
    America now insures dog lives.
    The value of dogs is extraordinary,
    Each one pays five thousand dollars,
    Big dogs and small dogs laugh heartily,
    Thanking their masters for their great kindness:
    "Tens of millions of people are unemployed,
    We don't see you caring at all;
    So many black people are massacred,
    You pretend not to see.

    "Dog kingdom's annals record one thing,
    Your kindness and goodwill we'll remember forever,
    Thanks to your creativity,
    You value dog ways, not human ways!" (Attached image)

    狗寿保险
    天马诗  苗地画
    报载：美国不久前成立了一家专门保险“狗寿”的公司，每只狗的保险费最多的竟达五千美元。
    酒醉饭饱没事干，
    老爷太太找消遣，
    英国曾摆百兽宴，
    美国又保狗寿险。
    狗的身价不一般，
    每只缴款五千元，
    大狗小狗哈哈笑，
    感谢主人好恩典：
    “失业人口上千万，
    不见你们管一管；
    多少黑人被屠杀，
    你们假装没看见。
    “狗国春秋记一条，
    恩情盛意永记牢，
    多亏你们有创造，
    不重人道重狗道！”（附图片）
