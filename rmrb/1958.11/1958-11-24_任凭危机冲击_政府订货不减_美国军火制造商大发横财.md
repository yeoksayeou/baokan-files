　　Regardless of the Crisis, Government Orders Remain High
　　American Arms Manufacturers Make a Killing

　　(Reported by this newspaper) While millions of Americans are mired in unemployment and tens of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises are collapsing one after another, the profits of America's major arms monopoly groups are still increasing significantly.

　　A recent survey by the American magazine "Fortune" on the profits of the 500 largest American companies in 1957 shows that aircraft manufacturing and the electronics industry were the two most profitable manufacturing sectors last year. Six of the largest aircraft manufacturing companies increased their sales by 32% and their profits by 21% last year, despite a slump in national industrial sales. The electronics machinery industry, which manufactures missiles, increased its sales by 11% and its profits by 33%. Compared to the average profit of 11.4% achieved by the 500 largest American manufacturers in 1957, these companies' profit situations were as follows: "General Electric Company" (manufacturing aircraft engines and missile parts) had a profit of 20.1%, "United Aircraft Corporation" 20.3%, "General Dynamics Corporation" 19.3%, "Boeing Airplane Company" 21.3%, "North American Aviation" 19.9%, Chance Vought Aircraft 18.5%, Martin Company 16.9%, General Motors Corporation 17.2%, and Lockheed Aircraft Corporation 14.1%.

　　New military procurement contracts from the U.S. Department of Defense in 1957 totaled $17.3 billion, roughly maintaining the 1956 level. And the new military budget proposed this January has already greatly increased military orders. According to a recent report in the "Wall Street Journal" citing sources in the Department of Defense, military orders will increase by $10 billion this year to "boost" the "sluggish" economy. From this, it is not difficult to understand the secret behind the continued growth of profits of American arms monopolies in the face of the economic crisis.

    任凭危机冲击　政府订货不减
    美国军火制造商大发横财
    本报讯　当美国千百万人陷于失业，成千成万的中小企业纷纷倒闭的时候，美国的大军火垄断集团的利润仍有很大的增加。
    最近美国“幸福”杂志对1957年美国五百家大公司利润的调查报告显示，飞机制造和电子工业是去年获利最厚的两个制造业部门。六家最大的飞机制造公司在去年全国工业销售量一蹶不振的情况下，把它们的销货量增大了32％，利润增加了21％。制造导弹的电子机器工业则把它的销售量增大了11％，利润增加了33％。同美国五百家最大制造商1957年取得平均利润11.4％相比，这些公司获利的情况如下：“通用电气公司”（制造飞机发动机和导弹零件）的利润是20.1％，“联合飞机公司”是20.3％，“通用动力公司”是19.3％，“波音飞机公司”是21.3％，“北美飞机公司”是19.9％，查斯·沃特飞机公司是18.5％，马丁公司是16.9％，通用汽车公司是17.2％，洛克希德飞机公司是14.1％。
    1957年美国国防部新的军事订货合同共为一百七十三亿美元，大体上维持了1956年的水平。而今年1月新的军事预算提出后已使军事订货大大增加。据最近“华尔街日报”得自国防部的消息，今年为了给“不振”的经济“打气”，军事订货将比去年增加一百亿美元。从这里人们不难了解，在经济危机的冲击下，美国军火垄断企业的利润仍然在不断增长的奥妙所在了。
