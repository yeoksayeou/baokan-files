    Liberated Creativity
    ——Starting with the Sichuan Opera "Yibin White-Haired Girl"
     Xi Mingzhen
    The modern drama "Yibin White-Haired Girl," collectively created by the Yibin Sichuan Opera Troupe in Sichuan, is noteworthy both in terms of its creative path and its artistic achievements. "Yibin White-Haired Girl" is based on the story of Luo Changxiu's family in Fengyi Township, Yibin County, who were persecuted by local despots and landlords. The local bully landlord and head of the militia, Luo Xizhang, and the village chief, Luo Xilian, and others, in order to seize eighteen loads of grain land belonging to Luo Changxiu’s family, set fire to their house, drove her father to his death, and shot her brother, forcing Luo Changxiu, a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl, to flee to the desolate Duantou Mountain, where she lived for sixteen years. It was not until after liberation that the Party sent people to find her and bring her back. She then joined the agricultural cooperative and became a production activist in the new society.
    In the process of writing "Yibin White-Haired Girl," the Yibin Sichuan Opera Troupe embodied the mass line of literary and artistic creation and gave full play to the positive role of literature and art in serving politics.
    When talking about their motivation for starting to write this play, the comrades of the Yibin Sichuan Opera Troupe said that what attracted them was not the bizarre plot, but the attempt to use opera art to reflect this character and event with typical significance, to educate the people to cherish today's good life even more. Therefore, from the beginning, they adopted a method of closely integrating with the masses and relying on the masses to solve problems. When they felt that they could not fully understand Luo Changxiu's character in the creative process, they went to Fengyi Township Agricultural Cooperative and Duantou Mountain, where she lived, to understand, interview, and experience her life, mobilizing the entire troupe to discuss it together. When they felt that there were artistic problems that could not be solved, they asked amateur writers, reporters, language teachers, music teachers, art teachers, and comrades in the drama circle to assist and research. What is even more valuable is that they listened to the opinions of the masses with an open mind and studied more than 600 opinions from the masses. In this way, they completed the first performance script in just four days of intensive work. When they performed in Yibin City, the audience's reaction was that they "received a vivid education" and "hated the old society even more." Even when performing in rural squares, more than a thousand farmers, soaked in heavy rain, were unwilling to leave. They achieved a combination of professional and mass efforts, individual and collective efforts, and the troupe and the audience, which made the script authentic, moving, and achieved certain artistic achievements.
    The play is expressed in the form of Sichuan Opera. It enthusiastically sings the praises of Luo Changxiu's tenacious struggle, and expresses the irreconcilable contradiction between the peasants and the landlord class. In particular, the scenes of "Thinking of Relatives" and "Delivering Firewood" are strongly infectious. After Luo Changxiu was forced to Duantou Mountain, we clearly saw the tragic experience of this simple and innocent peasant girl in the cannibalistic old society. She became a "ghost-like" figure with white hair, a dark body, and long body hair. But class hatred supported her will to fight. The author gave full play to the characteristics of opera, concentrating Luo Changxiu's life and thought process on the mountain in a few lyrics. In particular, the author gave full play to the effectiveness of Sichuan Opera's Gaoqiang music and percussion instruments, so that these two solo performances were not only not boring, but could arouse heart-stirring passion. For example, the "Duan Zheng Hao" tune sung by Luo Changxiu in the "Thinking of Relatives" scene is a piece of music that expresses the catharsis of resentment: "The years are long, spring comes and autumn goes, then winter cold, during the day I search for food all over the mountain, grass roots and wild fruits fill my hungry stomach... Who has inflicted this suffering on me? Oh, it is that thief, that cannibalistic evil Luo Xizhang!..."
    This depiction of Luo Changxiu's mountain life and thoughts and feelings is not bleak and miserable, but full of激愤class hatred, giving people an impression of yearning for struggle.
    When Luo Changxiu lived in Duantou Mountain, she often ran to the edge of the mountain rock to see her mother. When the author wrote about her mood, it was also an upward passion: "... Oh, mother, mother, it is not that I, your child, heartlessly abandons you, but that I fear that if I return, I will die on the road like my brother, and there will be no hope of revenge. Wouldn't that be letting down my suffering on Duantou Mountain? Suffer the hardship but don't come down!"
    These lyrics have the characteristics of Sichuan Opera, and to a certain extent, they broke through the profound and elegant sentiment of ancient music. This simple style is precisely the characteristic of the folk song atmosphere in Sichuan Opera.
    In winter, on cold snowy days, Luo Changxiu, fearing that her mother and younger brother would be cold, sent the dead branches and stumps of Duantou Mountain to her mother, and when she saw that the land her mother had planted next to the house was barren, she helped her dig and loosen the land at night, which vividly showed the hardworking nature of Luo Changxiu.
    It is precisely because the comrades who participated in the creation relied on the masses and went deep into the masses, that they were able to understand the hardworking and kind qualities of Luo Changxiu, and therefore, they were able to express Luo Changxiu's simple character in more detail. For example, when Luo Changxiu decided to flee to Duantou Mountain, her mother took off her only quilted jacket, which was patched all over, and gave it to Changxiu. Changxiu couldn't resist her loving mother's love and reluctantly took the jacket. But when her mother turned her back, Changxiu suddenly ran out again, called out "Mom," put down the jacket, and ran away. This very small detail gripped people's hearts during the performance.
    Because the comrades who participated in the collective creation directly contacted the lives of the masses, their scripts were able to boldly break through the laws of classical opera language, bringing some fresh air to Sichuan Opera to a certain extent, and using language with a unique local style. However, in the lyrics, some places still cater to rhymes, making the sentences seem far-fetched and stiff, losing the style of modern language. In the use of local language, I think it must also be selective. Although too obscure dialects can increase the local color of the work, audiences in other places who do not understand them will also reduce the appeal of the play.
    "Yibin White-Haired Girl" also needs to be continuously improved, and it needs to be made more perfect through performances and through the appraisal of the masses. As a literary and artistic work, it must break through the limitations of real people and real events. From the perspective of publishing this script now, there are still some places where it is bound by real people and real events, and there are still some traces of imitating the opera "White-Haired Girl." Of course, Huang Shiren's oppression of Xi'er and Luo Xizhang's oppression of Luo Changxiu, although they have similarities, Xi'er and Luo Changxiu are ultimately two people, and the Northwest and Southwest regions each have different features. In Sichuan, due to the long-term division of warlords, the bully landlords have even more vulgar and cruel qualities of warlords and ruffians. Therefore, their exploitation and oppression of peasants is even more cruel. If he wants to seize the peasants' land, he doesn't have to rely on usurious means for exploitation like Huang Shiren, and Yang Bailao must sign the paper. He can simply ask his lackeys to do it for others, or simply kill people. If we can further reveal their crimes through Luo Changxiu's deeds and through a more profound depiction of the characteristics of the ruling class in Sichuan, it will be more educational.
    At the same time, the era when Luo Changxiu lived in Duantou Mountain was the most intense era of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese people experienced the impact of the turbulent revolutionary torrent, from the War of Resistance Against Japan to the War of Liberation, and the influence of the Great Revolution and the struggle of the socialist revolution after liberation should directly affect the lives of people of all classes in rural areas. Although Fengyi Township is located in southern Sichuan, the Red Army once passed through the border of southern Sichuan during the Long March. Of course, these people and events may lack direct contact with Luo Changxiu herself, but the torrent of this great era cannot but impact every corner of rural China. I think the script should be full of the atmosphere of the times and should show the characteristics of the struggle in rural Sichuan under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, which experienced the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation.
    Our entire country is in an era of great leap forward. Opera must take on the glorious task of expressing the heroic deeds of modern working people and serving socialist construction. We must break the mysterious view of classical opera. Opera workers must take action, actively carry out mass creative movements, and timely reflect the real lives of the working people. The creative path of "Yibin White-Haired Girl" tells us that this is a correct path.

    解放了的创作力
    ——从川剧“宜宾白毛女”谈起
     席明真
    四川宜宾川剧团集体创作的现代剧“宜宾白毛女”，无论从创作道路，或者剧本在艺术上的成就来看，都是值得注意的。“宜宾白毛女”是根据宜宾县凤仪乡的农民罗昌秀一家，被地主恶霸迫害的故事编写的。凤仪乡的恶霸地主团总罗锡章、保长罗锡联等人，为了强占罗昌秀家十八挑粮食的田地，放火烧了罗昌秀家的住房，逼死她的父亲，枪杀她的哥哥，以至逼得罗昌秀这个十五六岁的女孩子走投无路，逃向杳无人迹的断头山上，生活了十六个年头。直到解放后，党才派人把她找回来，参加了农业社，成了新社会的生产积极分子。
    宜宾川剧团在编写“宜宾白毛女”的工作中，体现了文艺创作的群众路线，发挥了文艺为政治服务的积极作用。
    宜宾川剧团的同志，在谈到他们开始编写这个剧本的动机时说，吸引他们的并不是离奇的情节，而是企图通过戏曲艺术反映这具有典型意义的人物和事件，教育人民更加珍视今天的美好生活，因此他们一开始就采取了和群众紧密结合、依靠群众解决问题的方法。当他们在创作过程中，感觉对罗昌秀的性格还不能完全体会时，便到凤仪乡农业社、和她住过的断头山去了解、访问和体验，发动全团人员来共同讨论。当他们感到艺术问题上有不能解决的困难，便去请教业余作者、记者、语文教师、音乐教师、美术教师以及戏剧界的同志来协助、研究。更其可贵的是，他们作到了虚心听取群众意见，对来自群众的六百多条意见都作了研究。就是这样，他们仅仅经过四天的突击工作，便完成了第一次的演出本。当他们在宜宾市演出时，观众的反映是“受到了一场生动的教育”，是“更加痛恨旧社会”。甚至于在农村广场演出时，在大雨淋漓中，一千多农民虽然满身淋湿也不愿离开。他们做到了专业与群众的结合，个人与集体的结合，剧团与观众的结合，才使得剧本真实、动人，在艺术上获得了一定的成就。
    剧本是用川剧形式来表现的，它热情地歌颂了罗昌秀的顽强斗争，表现了农民和地主阶级的不可调和的矛盾，特别是“思亲”、“送柴”这两场戏，是有强烈感染力的。罗昌秀被逼上了断头山以后，我们清楚地看见了这一个淳朴、天真的农家少女，在吃人的旧社会中的惨痛遭遇。她变成白发披肩、全身乌黑、汗毛很长的“鬼模样”。但阶级的仇恨，支持了她的斗争意志。作者发挥了戏曲的特点，把罗昌秀在山上的生活和思想过程，集中在几段唱词里。特别是发挥了四川戏的高腔音乐与打击乐器的效能，使得这两场单人表演的场面，不但不觉得枯燥，反而能引起动人心弦的激情。像描写罗昌秀在“思亲”一场中唱的“端正好”曲牌，就是舒泄愤懑之情的乐曲：“岁月漫长，春来秋去又冬凉，白日寻食遍山往，草根野果饱饥肠……这苦况是谁加在我身上，唔，就是那贼呀贼，吃人的恶贼罗锡章！……”
    这样描绘罗昌秀的山中生活和思想感情，就不是凄凄惨惨的，而是充满激愤的阶级仇恨的，给人以向往斗争的印象。
    罗昌秀在断头山生活时，经常跑到山岩边，去看她的母亲，作者在写她这一种心情时，也是一种向上的激情：“……哎呀呀，娘呀娘，儿非忍心抛别娘，怕的是归来又像哥哥样，无端送死在路旁，报仇雪恨无指望，岂不是辜负儿断头山上苦一场？受了苦来莫下场！”
    这一些唱词，有着四川戏的特点，也在一定程度上突破了古代乐曲深奥和典雅的情趣，这种朴素的风格，正是发挥了四川戏中所具有的民歌气息的特点。
    冬天，下雪的严寒的日子，罗昌秀怕母亲弟弟受冷，他把断头山的枯枝断梗，给母亲送去，而且看见母亲在屋旁种的地荒了，便在深夜帮她掘土、松地，这正是生动地表现了罗昌秀勤劳的本质。
    正因为参加创作的同志，依靠群众，深入群众，了解到罗昌秀这个人物的勤劳善良的品质，因此能够在一些细节上更深地表现了罗昌秀淳朴的性格。像罗昌秀决心逃往断头山上时，母亲把那件唯一的、千疤万补的烂棉紧身脱给昌秀，昌秀却不过慈母的爱，免强地把这件衣服拿着去了。但当母亲转背时，昌秀却突然又跑了出来，叫了一声“妈”，把衣服放下就跑走了。这个很小的细节，在演出中是扣紧了人的心弦的。
    由于参加集体创作的同志，直接接触群众的生活，他们的剧本才能够大胆突破古典戏曲语言的规律，在一定程度上给川剧带来了一些清新的气息，并且是运用了有独特地方风格的语言。不过在唱词当中，有些地方还是迁就韵脚，使得词句显得勉强，生硬，失去现代语言的风格。在使用地方语言上我以为也必须要有选择，过于冷僻的方言，虽然能够增加作品的地方色彩，但其他地方观众一时不懂，也会减低了戏的感染力。
    “宜宾白毛女”也还需要继续提高，需要通过演出，通过群众的鉴定，使它更加完善。作为文艺作品来说，必须突破真人真事的局限，从现在发表这个剧本来说，还有些被真人真事所束缚的地方，也还有着模仿歌剧“白毛女”的一些痕迹。当然，黄世仁压迫喜儿，与罗锡章压迫罗昌秀，尽管有其相同之处，但喜儿和罗昌秀究竟是两个人，西北与西南地区也究竟各具不同风貌，在四川，由于军阀长期割据的影响，恶霸地主更具有军阀和流氓的下流、残酷的品质。因此他们对于农民的剥削和压迫，就更加残酷了。他要侵占农民的土地，可以不像黄世仁那样，凭借高利贷的手段来进行剥削，必须要杨白劳在纸上画押，他可以就叫他的爪牙们帮别人代办，或者，干脆把人杀害了事。如果能够通过罗昌秀的事迹，通过对于四川统治阶级特点更深刻的描绘，进一步去揭露他们的罪恶，就会更有教育意义。
    与此同时，罗昌秀在断头山生活的时代，是中国革命最激烈的时代。中国人民经历了波涛汹涌的革命洪流的冲击，从抗日战争到解放战争，以及前一段时间，大革命的影响和解放后社会主义革命的斗争，都应该直接地影响着农村各阶层人民的生活。尽管凤仪乡僻处川南，但长征以来，红军曾经走过川南边境。当然，这些人和事，可能和罗昌秀本人缺乏直接联系，但这大时代的洪流，不能不冲激着中国农村的任何一个角落，我以为剧本中应该充满着时代的气息，应该表现出经历着抗日战争、解放战争的四川农村，在蒋匪统治下的斗争的特点。
    我们整个国家正处于大跃进的时代，戏曲要担负起表现现代劳动人民的英雄事迹，为社会主义建设服务的光荣任务，必须要打破对于古典戏曲的神秘看法，戏曲工作者要人人动手，积极开展群众性的创作运动，及时反映劳动人民的现实生活。“宜宾白毛女”的创作道路，告诉我们，这是一条正确的道路。
