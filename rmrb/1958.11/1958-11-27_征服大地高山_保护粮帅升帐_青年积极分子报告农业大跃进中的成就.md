Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Rural youth activists, who toil year-round in the fields and mountains of the motherland, today reported on their achievements in the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture at the National Congress of Youth Activists. It is because of their heroic labor that they have made great contributions to the ascension of our "Grain Marshal."

A wheat yield of 7,320 jin per mu – this is the high-yield record for winter wheat created by the "Satellite" People's Commune in Xiping County, Henan Province, during the summer harvest this year. This experimental plot was cultivated by several young people from the youth experiment platoon of this commune, together with their commune leader. Today, Feng Fuyao, the platoon leader of this youth experiment platoon, spoke at the congress.

Feng Fuyao's speech sounded like a very vivid and dramatic story. From the autumn of last year, when the young people started selecting two mu of land for wheat high-yield experiments, until the harvest in June this year, they were constantly opposed by a promoter of retreat – the rich middle peasant Chen Pangen. Over the year, the process of Feng Fuyao and his team creating a high-yield wheat record was a process of continuously defeating Chen Pangen. In today's speech, Feng Fuyao vividly described how they initially resolved not to be afraid, and that "no matter how strong the wind or how high the waves, the confidence in increasing production would not waver," and that they were determined to defeat conservative thinking; then, how they grasped the key to increased production through deep plowing and sufficient fertilizer, and implemented the method of more sowing; and then, how they carried out a series of field management tasks. Thus, they finally harvested 14,640 jin of wheat on two mu of land, and finally made that promoter of retreat, Chen Pangen, completely admit defeat and even compose a quick-clapper rhyme to praise them and sing the praises of the Communist Party.

The wheat high-yield experience introduced by Feng Fuyao vividly proves the correctness of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Feng Fuyao said: The achievements we have made are the result of the wise leadership of the Party. He expressed that under the leadership of the Party, they would strive to create more and greater wheat high-yield records next year.

The famous peasant scientist Wang Baojing's speech at the congress today once again proved the infinite creativity of the peasants under the leadership of the Party. Wang Baojing is now the head of the Fenghuo People's Commune in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province. He told everyone that in their commune, all the youth and more than 70% of the members are now participating in various scientific experiments and technical studies. 75% of the male members and 45% of the female members have learned the technical knowledge of cotton seed selection, pest control, pruning, and corn deep plowing, fertilization, detasseling hybridization, and artificial assisted pollination. In addition, twenty-five backbone members with certain scientific and technical knowledge have been trained. Over the past few years, they have cultivated a total of twenty-three new varieties of wheat, corn, and cotton using asexual hybridization, sexual hybridization, and distant hybridization methods. The commune has now established a scientific research committee, and seventeen production teams have established research offices. There are forty-four research projects in industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine, and other fields currently being researched, and as many as 427 varieties of wheat are being tested. Their combination of scientific research and production experiments has not only enriched the content of scientific research but also directly promoted production.

Wang Baojing's entire speech was permeated with this spirit: young people must have the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act; they must not be afraid of difficulties or failures; they must learn from experts, but they must not blindly believe in experts; they must eliminate inferiority complexes and break the mystical view of science. The Party taught them this way, and that is how they did it.

"The reason why our Fenghuo Commune's scientific research work can achieve such a scale, and the reason why I personally can receive such great honor, is entirely the result of the Party's care and cultivation. Without the Party, there would be no Wang Baojing. In the old society, I had never even heard of the term scientific research. Only the Party made me embark on this road. I will always listen to the Party's words and follow the Party!" Wang Baojing's words vividly reflect the brilliant light of the Party's leadership shining in the heart of this simple peasant.

"Opening up the Jiudian Gorge, diverting the Tao River to the high mountains." Yang Sheng, from the Yintao Project construction site in Gansu Province, reported to the congress the soaring heroism of the youth in the Communist Youth League engineering section in this project. The Yintao Project is an unprecedented large-scale water conservancy project in Gansu. Its task is to dig a "mountain canal" with a total length of 2,800 li. The Jiudian Gorge engineering section is the most arduous section of this project. The canyon has steep cliffs on both sides, and the 6,226-meter-long canal must be built on a semi-mountain at an altitude of 2,300 meters above sea level. The Party entrusted this task to the Communist Youth League and named this section of the project the Communist Youth League Engineering Section.

The young heroes built a "Communist Youth League New Village" with their own hands in the uninhabited canyon. They pledged to the Party: "If the Tao River does not go up the mountain, we will not return home!" On "July 1st" this year, they lit bonfires and worked hard through the night, spending this red night with a record of averaging three cubic feet of stone split per person per day. After dawn, Yang Sheng's team continued to work hard for another day, achieving a result of 7.8 cubic feet of stone split per person per day. In August, they and other teams came to the Jiudian Mountain construction site, each with a safety belt, and began to work in suspension. Below was the rolling Tao River. People said: "Thousands of heroes fight in the clouds, like eagles circling in the air." They built trestle roads, climbed vines, and pried stones while clinging to the rock walls. In order to blast away the obstacle to the "mountain canal" – the Parrot Beak, a cliff more than a hundred feet high – they worked hard in suspension for forty days and drilled four large cannon holes, each twenty meters deep. Two of the cannon holes were loaded with more than 7,000 jin of explosives, and two blasts blasted away 110,000 cubic feet of stone.

These heroic deeds are truly thrilling and moving. Yang Sheng's speech today fully demonstrates that the youth on the agricultural front in our country, under the leadership of the Party, have a strong confidence and infinite power to conquer nature.

The first speaker at today's conference was Gao Tianhui, head of the delegation of military youth activists and deputy director of of the Organization Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In his speech, he introduced the achievements of the military youth in the Great Leap Forward in the entire army.

In his speech, he first talked about the victorious deeds of the troops on the Fujian front in carrying out punitive strikes against Chiang's army on Kinmen. He said that when the soldiers sang praises of the victory on the Fujian front, they used poetry to describe it: "The East Sea is deep, the East Sea is long, the good news is like a spring thunder; the Silver Swallow soars through the clouds, riding the long wind, laughing at Chiang's planes plunging headfirst; the light cavalry of the angry sea takes the field for the first time, and Chiang's warships finally know how deep the sea is; the brave artillery shows its power, beating Chiang's army into hiding; the people laugh and the enemy mourns, and the three armies all appear on the merit list." This poem also fully expresses the heroic revolutionary spirit of the youth of the Fujian front troops.

Gao Tianhui said that the victory in the battle on the Fujian front should be attributed to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and to the support of the people of the whole country, especially the direct support of the people of Fujian. For this reason, he paid tribute on behalf of the military youth to the youth in various places, especially the youth in Fujian, who supported the struggle on the Fujian front.

In his speech, Gao Tianhui also talked about the troop training work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the achievements of the technological revolution and cultural revolution in the entire army, and the army's support for water conservancy construction, steel production, and railway construction.

Wang Lantao, the representative of the Youth Cotton and Grain Assault Team of the Hongwei Management District of the Gaotang People's Commune in Shandong Province, reported at the conference on their experience in creating a high-yield cotton record. Ma Jimin, Deputy Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, reported at the meeting on the situation of more than two million members of the Communist Youth League and youth in the Huaibei area of Anhui Province, under the leadership of the Party, striving to comprehensively realize the magnificent plan of river networkization, rice cultivation, and transforming Huaibei into Jiangnan.

A total of six people spoke at the conference today. The conference will continue tomorrow. (Attached picture)

    征服大地高山　保护粮帅升帐
    青年积极分子报告农业大跃进中的成就
    新华社26日讯　终年苦战在祖国的田野和高山上的农村青年积极分子们，今天在全国青年积极分子大会上报告了他们在农业大跃进中的功绩。正是由于他们的英雄劳动，为我国“粮帅”的升帐作出了巨大的贡献。
    小麦亩产七千三百二十斤，这是河南省西平县“卫星”人民公社今年夏收时创造的冬小麦高产纪录。这亩试验田是这个公社的青年试验排的几个青年和他们的社长在一起种植的。今天，这个青年试验排的排长冯富耀在大会上发了言。
    冯富耀的发言使人听来就像是一段非常生动曲折故事一样。青年们从去年秋天开始选择两亩田搞小麦丰产试验的时候起，一直到今年6月收割麦子的时候止，自始至终都碰到一个促退派——富裕中农陈盘根和他们作对。一年来，冯富耀他们创造小麦丰产纪录的过程，也就是不断战胜陈盘根的过程。冯富耀在今天的发言中生动地叙述了他们怎样一开始就下定决心，不怕“风再大，浪再高，增产信心不动摇”，非把保守思想打败不可；接着又怎样抓住了深翻、肥足的增产关键，并且实行了多下种的办法；然后又进行了一系列的田间管理工作，就这样，他们终于在两亩地里收了一万四千六百四十斤小麦，最后终于使那个促退派陈盘根彻底认输，并且编了快板来称赞他们和歌颂共产党。
    冯富耀所介绍的小麦丰产经验，生动地证明了党中央和毛主席提出的农业“八字宪法”的正确性。冯富耀说：我们取得的成绩是党的英明领导的结果。他表示要在党的领导下，力争明年创造更多更大的小麦丰产纪录。
    著名的农民科学家王保京今天在大会上的发言，再一次证明了党所领导下的农民那种无穷无尽的创造力。王保京现在是陕西省醴泉县烽火人民公社的社长，他向大家介绍，他们那个社里，现在全体青年和70％以上的社员都参加了各种科学试验和技术学习。75％的男社员和45％的女社员已经学会了棉花的选种、防虫、整枝和玉米的深耕、施肥、去雄杂交、人工辅助授粉等技术知识，另外还培养了二十五名掌握一定的科学技术知识的骨干。几年来，他们用无性杂交、有性杂交和远缘杂交的办法，已培育出小麦、玉米、棉花的新品种共二十三种。公社里现在成立了科学研究委员会，十七个生产队都成立了研究室，正在进行研究的工业、农业、畜牧业、医学等方面的研究项目有四十四项，正在试验的小麦品种达四百二十七种。他们的科学研究和生产试验相结合，不仅丰富了科学研究的内容，而且直接推动了生产。
  王保京的整个发言贯串着这样一个精神：青年人要有敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，要不怕困难，不怕失败，要向专家学习，但是不要迷信专家，要打掉自卑感，破除对科学的神秘观点。党是这样教导他们，他们也就是这样干的。
    “我们烽火社的科学研究工作能够取得这样的规模，我个人能够得到这样大的荣誉，完全是党的关怀和培养的结果，没有党，就没有我王保京。在旧社会里，我连科学研究这个名词都没有听说过。只有党，才使我踏上了这条路。我要永远听党的话，跟着党走！”王保京这一段话，生动地体现了党的领导在这个淳朴的农民心中所闪耀着的灿烂的光辉。
    “打通九甸峡，引洮上高山。”来自甘肃省引洮工程工地的杨升，向大会报告了他所在的共青团工程段的青年们在这个工程中气冲云霄的英雄气概。引洮工程在甘肃是个规模空前宏大的水利工程，它的任务是要挖出一条全长二千八百华里的“山上运河”，九甸峡工程段就是这个工程中最艰险的一个工段。峡谷两岸危崖峭壁，长达六千二百二十六公尺的渠道要修在拔海二千三百公尺高的半山上。党把这个任务交给了共青团，并把这段工程命名为共青团工程段。
    青年英雄们在人烟绝迹的峡谷中用双手建起了“共青团新村”，他们向党保证：“引洮不上山，誓不回家园！”在今年“七一”那天，他们烧起野火连夜苦战，用平均一人一天劈石三方的纪录，度过了这个红色的夜晚。天亮后，杨升所在的小队又继续苦战了一天，取得了每人一天劈石七点八方的战果。8月里，他们和别的队一起来到九甸山工地，每个人身系安全带，开始悬空施工，下面是滚滚的洮河，人们说：“千百英雄云里战，好似雄鹰空中盘。”他们修起栈道，手攀藤葛，身贴岩壁撬石头。他们为了炸掉“山上运河”的障碍——高达一百多丈的危崖鹦哥嘴，曾悬空苦战四十天，打成了四个二十公尺深的大炮眼。有两个炮眼装了七千多斤炸药，两炮就炸掉了石头十一万方。
    这些英雄事迹听起来真是使人惊心动魄，感动万分。杨升今天的发言，充分说明我国农业战线上的青年，在党的领导下，有征服大自然的坚强信心和无穷无尽的力量。
    在今天大会上首先发言的是部队青年积极分子代表团团长、中国人民解放军总政治部组织部副部长高天辉。他在发言中介绍了军队青年在全军大跃进中的成就。
    他在发言中首先谈到了福建前线部队对金门蒋军进行惩罚性打击的胜利事迹。他说，战士们歌颂福建前线的胜利时，用诗歌作了这样的描绘：“东海深，东海长，捷报如同春雷响；银燕腾云驾长风，笑看蒋机倒栽葱；怒海轻骑初上阵，蒋舰方知海水深；神勇炮兵显威风，揍得蒋军钻地洞；人民欢笑敌报丧，三军齐上功劳榜。”这首诗也充分表现了福建前线部队青年英勇豪迈的革命气概。
    高天辉说，福建前线作战的胜利，应该归功于党和毛主席的英明领导，归功于全国人民的支援，特别是福建人民的直接支援。他为此代表军队青年向支援福建前线斗争的各地青年特别是福建青年致敬。
    高天辉在发言中还谈到中国人民解放军的部队训练工作，全军技术革命、文化革命的成果，军队支援水利建设、钢铁生产和铁道建设等情况。
    山东省高唐人民公社宏卫管理区青年棉粮突击团的代表王兰亭在大会上报告了他们创造棉花高产纪录的经过。共青团安徽省委副书记马继民在会上报告了安徽省淮北地区二百多万共青团员和青年在党的领导下，为全面实现河网化、水稻化、变淮北为江南的宏伟规划而奋斗的情况。
    今天在大会上发言的共六人。大会明天将继续进行。（附图片）
