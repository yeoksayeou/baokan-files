Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, October 31st. The meeting of representatives of the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on the issue of halting nuclear weapons testing opened this afternoon at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. This meeting is intended to continue the work on the political aspects of the Geneva Nuclear Weapons Test Expert Conference held in July and August of this year. At the experts' conference, experts from Eastern and Western countries unanimously agreed that it was possible to detect violations of the ban on nuclear weapons testing, and drafted a set of worldwide monitoring systems for the relevant governments to consider.

    Speaking at the meeting today, Soviet representative Tsarapkin pointed out that the goal of the Soviet delegation is to strive for the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, to reach a corresponding agreement, and to establish a practical and feasible monitoring system.

    He said: The Soviet government demands that all countries possessing nuclear weapons immediately and permanently cease testing nuclear weapons. He also said that if the United States and the United Kingdom agree to a permanent cessation of testing, the Soviet Union will cease its own testing, even though the Soviet Union has conducted fewer tests.

    If the West follows the Soviet Union's attitude, it can permanently eliminate all threats posed by nuclear weapons testing to humanity.

    Tsarapkin said that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom have already agreed to the conclusions and recommendations of the experts' conference. Therefore, the necessary preparatory measures have already been taken. Now is the time to take the final step—to stop nuclear testing, sign the relevant agreement, and earnestly begin to establish the monitoring system proposed by the experts. The Soviet Union is ready to immediately conclude a permanent agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and establish the monitoring system proposed by the experts. The Soviet delegation has drafted a draft agreement and will submit it to this conference for discussion.

    U.S. representative Wadsworth reiterated the U.S. government's position, stating that it does not agree to an unconditional, immediate, and permanent cessation of testing. He indicated that the United States is only willing to stop testing on a "year-by-year basis" and on the condition that the inspection system is established and "effectively functioning" and that "satisfactory progress" is made in other aspects of disarmament.

    Wadsworth's opinion is considered a tactic by the United States to evade the worldwide pressure to ban nuclear weapons testing, adding various conditions to the cessation of nuclear testing, thereby making the solution of this problem difficult.

    After a brief speech by British representative Ormsby-Gore, a closed meeting began.

    苏联代表在日内瓦会议上指出
    苏联准备缔结永久停止核试验协议
    美国故意制造困难给停止核试验加上种种条件
    新华社日内瓦31日电　苏联、美国和英国三国政府代表关于停止核武器试验问题的会谈今天下午在这里的国联大厦开幕。这次会议是要从政治方面继续今年7、8月间举行的日内瓦核武器试验问题专家会议的工作。在专家会议上，东西方国家的专家们曾经一致认为侦察违反禁止核武器试验规定的行为是可能的，并且草拟了一套全世界范围的监督制度，供有关各国政府考虑。
    苏联代表查拉普金今天在会上发言时指出，苏联代表团的目标是争取停止核武器试验，争取达成相应的协定并且建立切实可行的监督制度。
    他说：苏联政府要求一切拥有核武器的国家立即而且永远地停止试验核武器。他又说，如果美国和英国同意永久停止试验，苏联将停止它自己的试验，尽管苏联已经进行过的试验次数较少。
    如果西方效法苏联的态度，那就能永远消除核武器试验对人类的一切威胁。
    查拉普金说，苏、美、英三国政府已经同意专家会议的结论和建议。所以，必要的准备措施已经采取过了。现在已是采取最后步骤——停止核试验，签订有关的协议，并且切实着手建立专家们提出的监督制度的时候了。苏联准备立即缔结永久停止核武器试验的协议，建立专家们所提出的监督制度。苏联代表团已经拟就这种协议的草案，将提交这次会议讨论。
    美国代表华兹沃斯重申美国政府的立场，表示不同意无条件地立即永久停止试验。他表明，美国只愿意在“逐年的基础上”停止试验，并且以视察制度的建立和“有效地发挥作用”以及在裁军的其他方面取得“令人满意的进展”为条件。
    华兹沃斯的意见被认为是美国企图逃避全世界要求禁止核武器试验的压力的一种手法，它给停止核试验加上种种条件，从而使这个问题的解决变得困难。
    在英国代表奥姆斯比—戈尔作了简短发言后开始举行秘密会议。
