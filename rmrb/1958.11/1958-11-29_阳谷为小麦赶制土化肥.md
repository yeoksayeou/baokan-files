    Yanggu Hastens Production of Native Fertilizer for Wheat
    (Our Dispatch) Yanggu County, Shandong Province, is seizing the current favorable opportunity to mobilize the masses to produce native fertilizer on a large scale, preparing sufficient "refined grain" for wheat in an effort to strive for an even greater wheat harvest next year.
    At present, the autumn harvest and autumn planting have basically concluded, and there is very little rain and snow, which is the best time to collect raw materials for native fertilizer and manufacture native fertilizer. To this end, in addition to establishing a professional team of more than 36,000 people to manufacture native fertilizer, Yanggu County has also mobilized the broad masses to adopt measures such as "four sweeps" of alkaline land, wall corners, houses, and courtyard streets, and "four retentions" of keeping chicken feathers after eating chicken, keeping animal bones after slaughtering livestock, keeping hair after haircuts, and keeping ash after burning firewood, to extensively and massively collect raw materials for manufacturing native fertilizer. In this way, it ensures a sufficient source of raw materials, enabling the daily output to gradually increase from 50 to 60 million jin in August to more than 100 million jin. Now, all 950 large and small native fertilizer factories in the county have raw materials and finished products piled up like mountains, with a constant stream of traffic in front of their doors, and a large amount of native fertilizer is continuously transported to wheat fields. Each mu of wheat land in the county has already had 5,000 jin of native fertilizer applied as topdressing.

    阳谷为小麦赶制土化肥
    本报讯　山东阳谷县抓紧目前有利时机，发动群众大造土化肥，为小麦准备充足的“细粮”，以力争明年小麦更大丰收。
    目前，秋收秋种基本结束，雨雪又很少，正是搜集土化肥原料和制造土化肥的最好时光。为此，阳谷县除已建立起一支三万六千多人的制造土化肥专业队伍以外，并发动广大群众，采取扫碱地、墙脚、屋内、院街土的“四扫”和吃鸡留毛、杀畜留骨、剪头留发、烧柴留灰的“四留”等措施，广泛、大量的搜集制造土化肥的原料。这样，就保证了原料的来源充足，使日产量从8月份的五、六千万斤，逐步上升到一亿多斤。现在，全县九百五十个大小土化肥厂，厂厂原料和成品都聚集如山，门前车水马龙，大量的土制化肥，源源运往麦田，全县每亩麦地已追施土化肥五千斤。
