    Systematically Study Traditional Chinese Medicine Theory
    Yu Rongqing, Affiliated Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    I am a Western medicine doctor with six years of clinical experience. At the end of 1955, I began to study Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and this summer, I graduated from the TCM research class.
    Before studying TCM, I had witnessed some vivid examples of TCM treating diseases. For example, acupuncture at the cheek Che (颊车) and Hegu (合谷) points could immediately stop sore throats. A very stubborn patient with cirrhosis and ascites saw the ascites completely disappear after TCM treatment. These experiences made me realize that there was a rich treasure in TCM, and I was willing to learn it. However, at that time, I did not have a correct understanding of how to learn TCM. My attitude towards learning TCM was like exploring for treasure in the deep mountains; I would be satisfied if I could learn effective TCM treatments for certain diseases. Therefore, at the beginning of my studies, I paid too much attention to certain prescriptions and medicines for treating certain diseases, while neglecting the systematic study of TCM theory.
    TCM theory is relatively dry, especially because I am a Western medicine doctor, and some Western medicine concepts had already taken root. It was not easy to accept the simple materialistic theories of TCM, such as the Yin-Yang and Five Elements theories. I often confused them with Western medicine anatomy and physiology, getting tangled up in them. As a result, I felt that TCM and Western medicine were incompatible, and I could not humbly explore its profound meaning.
    This learning attitude and method immediately encountered obstacles during clinical practice. The most profound experience was during my internship when treating a patient with anemia and dizziness. I considered the anemia to be "blood deficiency" and the dizziness to be "liver Yang rising," so I prescribed medicines to nourish blood and calm the liver, but there was no improvement. Later, I lost confidence in treating the patient and consulted my teacher. After the teacher's diagnosis, the patient had characteristics such as a pale face, shortness of breath, and a thin pulse, which indicated a deficiency of both Qi and blood. The teacher added Huangqi (Astragalus) and Dangshen (Codonopsis) to my prescription to replenish Qi. The patient's anemia and dizziness quickly improved. Within a month, the red blood cell count increased from 3.2 million to 4.17 million.
    Here is another example. There was a patient with gallstones and neurasthenia who was often restless and could only sleep for two or three hours each night. If he read even a little during the day, he would be even more troubled at night. Because the patient had suffered from insomnia for many years, commonly used Western medicine sleeping pills were ineffective, and general TCM medicines for calming the nerves and nourishing the heart were also ineffective. This patient was relatively thin, and his characteristics were a very red tongue with no coating and a thin, soft pulse. After careful diagnosis, it was determined to be a manifestation of Yin deficiency and internal heat. Therefore, according to the "Shaoyin" chapter of the Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases, "If there is vexation in the heart and one cannot sleep, Huanglian Ejiao Tang (Coptis and Ass Hide Gelatin Decoction) is the main treatment," this prescription was prescribed. After taking the medicine, the patient felt very comfortable in his heart that night, and a thin layer of coating grew on his red tongue. After that, his sleep quickly returned to normal.
    As my clinical time increased, I increasingly felt the importance of systematically studying TCM theory. Now, when I reread the Inner Canon of Medicine and the Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases, I realize that they are indeed as important as Western medicine anatomy and physiology as the theoretical foundation of TCM. The heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys mentioned in the Inner Canon of Medicine have very different meanings from the heart, liver, etc., described in Western medicine anatomy and physiology books, and cannot be lightly confused. However, its meaning and related theories can guide TCM practice and cure diseases. TCM's four diagnostic methods, eight principles, and the Yin-Yang and Five Elements theories play a significant role in guiding clinical practice.
    Studying classical TCM theory has very practical significance for modern TCM clinical treatment. Of course, we will not be satisfied with the current state. When we systematically study and fully master TCM theory, we can absorb its essence and closely integrate it with Western medicine theory to better benefit the Chinese people and all of humanity.

    系统地学习祖国医学理论
    中医研究院附属医院　俞荣青
    我是一个有了六年临床工作经验的西医。1955年底我开始学习祖国医学，今年夏季，我已经在中医研究班毕业。
    未学习祖国医学之先，我曾目睹了祖国医学治疗疾病的一些生动例子，例如针刺颊车，合谷能立即制止咽痛。一个十分顽固的肝硬变腹水患者经中医治疗，腹水完全消失了，这些，使我体会到祖国医学中是有丰富宝藏的，我愿意学习祖国医学。然而，如何学习祖国医学，当时却没有正确的认识。那时学习中医的态度就好像到深山探宝一样，能学到中医治疗某些疾病的特效疗法便满足了。因而，在学习之初，过分注意某方某药治疗某种疾病，而忽略了系统地学习祖国医学理论。
    中医理论是比较枯燥的，尤其因为自己是一个西医，西医的一些东西早已先入为主，对于祖国医学朴素的唯物理论，阴阳五行学说，不容易接受，常常把它和西医的解剖生理混淆在一起，纠缠不清。于是觉得中医和西医格格不入，不能十分虚心地探索它深奥的含义。
    这种学习态度和学习方法，一到临床实践的时候，便立刻碰到钉子。最深刻的一次是实习期间治疗一个贫血头昏的患者，我把贫血认为“血虚”，头昏是“肝阳上越”，给予养血平肝的药，一直不见好。后来自己没有信心再治下去了，去请教老师，经过老师的辨症，患者有面白、少气、脉细等特点，认为是气血两亏，在我开的处方中加入了黄芪，党参两味补气的药物，患者的贫血头昏很快地有了进步，一个月中红血球由三百二十万增加到四百一十七万。
    再举一个例子，有一位患胆石症，并患神经衰弱的病人，经常心烦不安，每晚只能睡二三小时，白天稍一看书，夜里那就更苦恼了。因为患者失眠已经多年，西医常用的安眠药已经无效，一般安神养心的中药也没有作用。这位患者比较苍瘦，特征是舌质很红、没有舌苔、脉息细软。经过仔细的辨症，认为是阴虚内热的表现，于是按照伤寒论少阴篇的“心中烦，不得卧，黄连阿胶汤主之”，处给该方。患者服药之后，当天晚上心中便很痛快，光红的舌头上长起了薄薄的一层苔，以后睡眠很快恢复到正常。
    随着临床时间的增加，我越来越感到系统地学习中医理论的重要。现在从新翻阅内经，伤寒论，便体会到它们确实和西医的解剖生理一样是中医学重要的理论基础。中医内经上所说的心、肝、脾、肺、肾和西医解剖生理书上所说的心脏、肝脏有着十分不同的含义，是不能轻率的混为一谈的，然而它的含义和有关的理论却能指导中医的实践，能够把疾病治好。中医的四诊八纲，阴阳五行学说对于指导临床实验有着极大的作用。
    学习中医古典理论，对于现代中医临床治疗中具有十分现实的意义。当然我们不会满足于现有的状态。当我们系统学习，全面掌握了中医学的理论之后，我们就能吸取它的精髓和西医理论紧密的结合起来，更好地为中国人民以及全世界的人类造福。
