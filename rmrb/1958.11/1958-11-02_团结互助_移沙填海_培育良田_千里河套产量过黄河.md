    Unite and Help Each Other, Move Sand to Fill the Sea, Cultivate Fertile Fields
    The Hetao Plain's Yield Exceeds the Yellow River

    (Reported by our newspaper) This year, the grain crops in the Hetao area of Inner Mongolia have surpassed the Yellow River, achieving the target of 400 jin per mu. The rural areas of Hetao have basically been communized.

    The Hetao area has a low-lying terrain, and many places are "hai zi" (small and large pools of water where crops do not grow). Ma Wu'ai (Communist Party member), the director of Shengfeng Cooperative, based on his many years of farming experience in Hetao, knew that the sediment at the bottom of the "hai zi" was very thick and the soil was very fertile. If this sediment were covered with sandy soil, it would become first-class fertile land. He was determined to move sand to fill the sea and cultivate fertile fields. Last winter, he led more than 140 Mongolian and Han cooperative members, braving the harsh winter weather, carrying sand day and night to fill the sea. Finally, they filled a "hai zi" with an area of ​​more than 900 mu and a depth of two or three feet, and sowed millet. According to the luxuriant growth of this crop, it is expected to produce more than 280,000 jin of millet.

    In the Wulan Haofeng National United Cooperative in Wuyuan County, the Thirteenth Team is composed of ten Mongolian households and twenty-three Han households. Among these ten Mongolian households, two are lamas. The Mongolian herdsmen, who have always engaged in animal husbandry production, have accumulated a large amount of fertilizer around a lama temple here. The lamas call it "sacred soil," and no one has ever dared to touch it. Since the Great Leap Forward, Mongolian cooperative members have broken with superstitious ideas and have asked to haul this "sacred soil" to the fields to produce more grain. One spring, this production team excavated more than 70,000 cartloads of "sacred soil" and applied it to the fields. Currently, the crops in these fields are growing particularly well.

    These days, the autumn harvesting work, centered on deep plowing, is being carried out intensely on the Hetao Plain, and the phenomenon of insufficient draft animals is becoming increasingly prominent. The herdsmen on the grassland proposed: "If our farmer brothers lack livestock, how can we stand idly by? We cannot only launch production satellites, but also launch national unity satellites." Mongolian herdsmen from Alxa League and Urad Middle and Rear United Banner selected tens of thousands of fat and strong cattle and horses to support the agricultural areas. The Han farmers expressed their gratitude for this major support of "sending cattle and horses from a thousand miles away, a heavy gift with deep friendship," and will use a large amount of hay and feed to help the livestock of their herding brothers survive the winter and spring as a reward. Many herdsmen also said to the farmers: "If you think the cattle and horses are not strong enough, we can also give you camels!"

    团结互助　移沙填海　培育良田
    千里河套产量过黄河
    本报讯　今年内蒙古河套粮食作物已跨过黄河，实现了亩产四百斤的指标，河套农村已基本上公社化。
    河套地区地势低洼，许多地方都是“海子”（不长庄稼的大小水潭），胜丰社主任马五挨（共产党员），凭着多年在河套种地的经验，知道海底淤泥很厚，土壤十分肥沃。这种淤泥若盖上沙土，就是头等良田。他决心移沙填海，培育良田。去年冬天，他带领一百四十多名蒙汉族社员，在数九寒天，日夜担沙填海。终于把一个面积约九百多亩、深达二、三尺的海子填平了，并播种了糜谷。根据这片庄稼的茂盛情况，预计能打二十八万多斤糜子。
    在五原县乌兰浩丰民族联合社里，第十三队是由十户蒙古族和二十三户汉族社员组成的。这十户蒙古族社员中，有两户是喇嘛。一向从事畜牧业生产的蒙古族牧民，就在这里一座喇嘛庙的周围积存了大量肥料，喇嘛称之为“神土”，从来没有人敢动。大跃进以来，蒙古族社员破除了迷信思想，纷纷要求把这些“神土”拉到田间，多产粮食。一个春天，这个生产队一共起挖了七万多车“神土”上到田里。目前，这些田里的庄稼长得特别好。
    这几天，河套平原上的以深翻为中心的三秋工作，正在紧张进行，耕畜不足的现象日渐突出。草原上的牧民提出：“农民兄弟缺牲畜，我们那能袖手旁观”，不能只放生产大卫星，也要放出民族团结大卫星”。阿拉善旗和乌拉特中后联合旗的蒙古族牧民们挑选了上万头肥壮牛马，前来农区支援。汉族农民对这种“千里送牛马，礼重情谊长”的重大支援，甚表感激，并要以大量饲草、饲料帮助牧民兄弟的牲畜过冬过春，作为酬谢。许多牧民还对农民说：“你们若嫌牛马力气小，我们还可以给骆驼！”
