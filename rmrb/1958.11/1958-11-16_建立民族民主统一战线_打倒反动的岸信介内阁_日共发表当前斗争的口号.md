Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th: The Japanese Communist Party published the following slogans regarding current demands and uniting all democratic forces in Japan in today's "Akahata" newspaper:

　　1. The Liberal Democratic Party's resolution to unilaterally extend the Diet's extraordinary session, which tramples on parliamentary politics, is invalid; the Diet must be dissolved immediately.

　　2. Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, Speaker of the House of Representatives Jiro Hoshijima, and Vice-Speaker Saburo Shiikuma, who are destroying the parliamentary system and attempting to establish a Liberal Democratic Party dictatorship, must resign. Overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, which revises the "Police Duties Execution Law," pursues war policies and treasonous policies, and promotes reactionary politics.

　　3. The "Police Duties Execution Law" must not be revised under the pretext of "public safety and order" in an attempt to revive the police state, deprive basic human rights, and suppress democratic and workers' movements.

　　4. Stop the negotiations to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" that plot to use Japanese people as cannon fodder for the United States; oppose the U.S., Japan, Chiang, and Rhee military alliance; fundamentally revise the San Francisco "Peace Treaty," abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement"; withdraw military bases within Japan, and recover Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands.

　　5. Oppose the United States' aggressive acts against China and interference in China's internal affairs; the United States must withdraw from the Taiwan Strait area; demand the abolition of the Japan-Chiang "Treaty," smash the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and strive to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

　　6. Maintain democratic education, oppose the "performance evaluation" system. Smash the conspiracy of the "Matsukawa Incident" trial. Oppose amending the Constitution, and safeguard the rights and freedoms of democratic and workers' movements.

　　7. Launch a struggle against "rationalization" measures that reduce wages, lay off workers, and increase labor intensity; give bread to the unemployed. Formulate agricultural product prices that are beneficial to farmers. Compensate for disaster losses. Oppose amending the law prohibiting monopolies. Strive to realize a social security system and a minimum wage system to protect the people's lives, health, and lives.

　　8. Launch a struggle to protest the government's policies of suppressing and splitting democratic forces.

　　9. Oppose tendencies that hinder the unity of democratic forces, and strengthen the united action of all patriotic democratic forces, including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

　　10. For peace, independence, democracy, and improving living standards, strive to form a national democratic united front and establish a government of the national democratic united front.

　　11. Oppose U.S. imperialist atomic war provocations and colonialism, and strengthen solidarity with socialist, democratic, peaceful, and independent forces throughout the world.
