Xinhua News Agency, November 29th—Albanian Ambassador to China, Ballauri, held a grand reception tonight to celebrate the 14th anniversary of Albania's liberation.

Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the reception and delivered a speech. In his speech, he warmly expressed that the Chinese people would do their utmost to consolidate and develop the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples, consolidate the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and warmly cheered the grand plan for the Soviet Union's transition to communism—the draft of the Seven-Year Economic Construction Plan recently announced by the Soviet Union.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "The Chinese and Albanian peoples are brotherly members of the great family of the socialist camp. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong. Recently, the Soviet Union announced the draft of the Seven-Year Economic Construction Plan, which is a grand plan for the Soviet Union's transition to communism. It will make the communist society, which mankind has long yearned for, a reality in the near future. The Chinese people, like the progressive people all over the world, cheer for this great plan of the Soviet people."

After warmly congratulating the Albanian people on their great achievements in building socialism, Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out: "The Albanian people possess the heroic spirit of despising all enemies. You stand at the forefront of defending the socialist family. The Albanian people have made great contributions in consolidating great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and opposing modern revisionism, and in defending world peace and opposing imperialism. The Chinese people express their heartfelt admiration for the Albanian people who fight tenaciously under the banner of internationalism."

Vice Premier Chen Yi concluded: "The Chinese people are particularly grateful to the Albanian people for their strong support in our struggle against American imperialist aggression. The Chinese people cherish the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples and will make every effort to continuously consolidate and develop this fraternal friendship. The Chinese people will always stand with the Albanian people and advance shoulder to shoulder for the victory of our common cause."

Also attending tonight's reception were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, and Cheng Qian of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman Bao Erhan of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Huang Kecheng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

Ambassador Ballauri delivered a speech at the beginning of the reception to welcome his guests. He said that November 29, 1944, marked the greatest victory in the history of the Albanian people. From then until now, under the leadership of the Labor Party and the people's government, Albania has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country. The third Five-Year Plan will transform Albania into an industrial-agricultural country.

Ambassador Ballauri pointed out that in obtaining all these victories, the Albanian people have always received the selfless help of our great friend, the Soviet Union, which we will never forget. At the same time, in the past and now, the People's Republic of China and other People's Democratic countries of our great peaceful socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, have also given our people tremendous help. This help and fraternal support is one of the important reasons for our people's victory.

Ambassador Ballauri said: "Now our people feel that they are no longer as weak and isolated as in the past. It is strong and prosperous. In Albania, people are used to saying that we are not 1.5 million people but 900 million. This is why the Albanian people are not afraid of the threats and conspiracies of imperialism and their lackey revisionists." Ambassador Ballauri stated that the Albanian people "will resolutely fight to the end to protect peace and the purity of Marxism-Leninism."

In his speech, Ambassador Ballauri praised the ever-developing friendship between the Albanian and Chinese peoples, which is based on proletarian internationalism. He then severely condemned the American imperialists for interfering in China's internal affairs and attempting to create a "two Chinas" plot, and pointed out that the American imperialists' conspiracy is bound to meet with shameful failure.

The speeches of Vice Premier Chen Yi and Ambassador Ballauri won warm and prolonged applause from the audience.

To celebrate the 14th anniversary of Albania's liberation, Ambassador Ballauri also held a press conference today, introducing the history of the Albanian people's heroic struggle and their great construction achievements.

    据新华社29日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻华大使巴利里今晚举行盛大招待会，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十四周年。
    陈毅副总理出席招待会并讲了话。他在讲话中热情地表示中国人民要竭尽全力巩固和发展中阿两国人民的兄弟之谊，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，热烈地欢呼苏联向共产主义过渡的宏伟计划——苏联最近公布的七年经济建设计划提纲。
    陈毅副总理说：“中阿两国人民是社会主义阵营大家庭中的兄弟成员，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是空前的强大。最近，苏联公布了七年经济建设计划提纲，这是苏联向共产主义过渡的宏伟计划，它将使人类长期向往的共产主义社会成为不久将来的现实。中国人民同全世界进步人类一样，为苏联人民的这一伟大计划欢呼。”
    陈毅副总理在热烈地祝贺了阿尔巴尼亚人民建设社会主义的巨大成就以后指出：“阿尔巴尼亚人民具有蔑视一切敌人的英雄气概。你们站在保卫社会主义大家庭的最前线。在巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结、捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁和反对现代修正主义的斗争中，在保卫世界和平和反对帝国主义的斗争中，阿尔巴尼亚人民都做出了巨大的贡献。中国人民对于站在国际主义的旗帜下，顽强斗争的阿尔巴尼亚人民表示衷心的敬佩。”
    陈毅副总理最后说：“中国人民特别感谢阿尔巴尼亚人民在我国反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，给予我们的有力支持。中国人民十分珍视中阿两国人民的这种兄弟之谊，并且将竭尽一切努力来不断地巩固和发展这种兄弟之谊。中国人民将永远同阿尔巴尼亚人民在一起，为了我们共同的事业的胜利，并肩前进。”

    巴利里大使在招待会开始时致词欢迎他的客人们。他说，1944年11月29日标志着阿尔巴尼亚人民历史上最伟大的胜利。从那时到现在，阿尔巴尼亚在劳动党和人民政权的领导下，已从一个落后的农业国变成了一个农业工业国。而第三个五年计划将把阿尔巴尼亚变成一个工业农业国。
    巴利里大使指出，在这一切胜利的获得中，阿尔巴尼亚人民一直得到了我们伟大的朋友苏联的无私帮助，这是我们永生难忘的，同时在过去和现在，中华人民共和国和以苏联为首的我们伟大的和平社会主义阵营的其他各人民民主国家也一直给我国人民巨大的帮助。这一帮助和兄弟支援是我国人民获得胜利的重要原因之一。
    巴利里大使说：“现在我国人民感到不再和过去那样弱小和孤立无援的，它是强大和繁荣的，在阿尔巴尼亚，人们习惯说我们不是一百五十万人而是九亿。这就是为什么阿尔巴尼亚人民不怕帝国主义和他们的走狗修正主义者的威胁和阴谋的原因。”巴利里大使表示，阿尔巴尼亚人民“为了保护和平和马列主义的纯洁，它要坚决地斗争到底”。
    巴利里大使在讲话中称颂了建立在无产阶级国际主义基础上的日益发展的阿、中两国人民的友谊后，严厉谴责了美帝国主义干涉中国内政并企图制造“两个中国”的罪恶阴谋，并且指出，美帝国主义的阴谋必定遭到可耻的失败。
    陈毅副总理和巴利里大使的讲话，博得了全场长时间的热烈掌声。
    为庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十四周年，巴利里大使今天还举行了记者招待会，介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民英勇斗争的历史和巨大建设成就。
