Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th: Mechanical industry workers in Henan Province have used native steel produced in the province to manufacture a large number of products. According to statistics from the machinery factories in Shangcheng and Lushan counties and the Zhengzhou Agricultural and Textile Machinery Manufacturing Schools alone, there are more than 800 types of agricultural tools, instruments, mechanical equipment, and parts made of native steel. Moreover, the quality is comparable to that of products made of foreign steel, and they are very popular with users. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is currently promoting a great leap forward in the machinery industry by organizing the widespread use of native steel throughout the province's mechanical industry.

The use of native steel to manufacture agricultural tools and daily necessities is quite common in various parts of Henan and has a long history. However, many people believe that native steel can only be used to manufacture these simple and crude tools and that it is impossible to manufacture machines. These questions have now been answered by practice. The Zhengzhou Textile Machinery School has used native steel to make shapers and quick-action vises; the Zhengzhou Industrial School has used native steel to make oil presses, water pumps, and small steel mills. After appraisal, the quality of these products fully meets the standards.

The native steel currently used by the machinery industry in various regions is all forged from iron furnaces. The steel ingots are very small, generally only one or two kilograms in weight. Therefore, it can only be used to manufacture small tools and small machines and their accessories. However, as the quality of native steel improves and it is rolled into steel, the use of native steel will expand accordingly. Recently, Shangcheng County and the Zhengzhou Machinery Manufacturing School have drawn high-quality No. 7 and No. 32 steel wires using native steel. Relevant departments in Henan Province are currently actively organizing the production of small rolling mills in various regions to turn native steel into small steel materials, such as round steel, square steel, and wire. They are also preparing to use wire drawing machines to draw some small round steel into wire steel for the mechanical industry to manufacture equipment. At the same time, to further improve the quality of native steel and produce some larger medium-sized parts, mechanical forging methods are required in places where conditions permit, so that small steel ingots can be turned into large steel billets.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 9th: Workers at the Nongju Machinery Factory in You County, Hunan Province, recently used native steel and pig iron produced in the county to make a belt lathe. This has opened up a path for the large-scale utilization of native steel and iron and has also found a broad source of materials for the machinery industry. The quality of this 4.5-foot-long lathe is very good, and workers are currently using it to process mechanical parts such as blower pulleys and ball bearings in large quantities.

When the workers started using native steel produced in You County to manufacture lathes, they did not master the quenching time well. The native steel was still not durable after forging, and several blanks that were made broke. The workers then adopted the method of quenching and forging at the same time, repeatedly quenching and forging, and finally increased the strength of the steel and made the parts. For larger parts such as lead screws and headstocks, it was not possible to make them with one piece of native steel. The workers put several pieces of native steel into the furnace to heat them and then forged and welded them together. They worked continuously for two days and two nights, but they could not weld them together well. Factory Director Jiang Derui then held a meeting with eleven blacksmiths by the furnace to study the problem. They found that the reason was that the temperature was not high enough and the steel was not thoroughly heated. They increased the bellows, added fuel, and extended the heating time, and finally forged the straight and round lead screw and other part blanks.

After the lathe was made, the workers' confidence was even greater. They said that they would produce more than 100 machine tools this year and guarantee to undertake the task of arming the entire county with machine tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th: The Native Steel Use Exhibition recently held in Hongqiao District, Tianjin, displayed many products made of native steel by more than 20 units, indicating that native steel has great potential.

Among the exhibits were three hard alloy cutting tools, steel files, sledgehammers, and foundry tools successfully trial-produced by the First Tool and Cutting Tool Factory; gears made by the Tianjin Scientific Instrument Factory; and lead screws and screws made by the Tianjin Machine Tool Repair Factory. These tools, agricultural implements, and machine parts were all made of crude steel made from scrap iron such as broken pot iron through native furnaces, and the quality was fully qualified. At the exhibition, there were also some products made of native steel that had been forged from scrap iron pieces and leftover materials of even lower quality. (Attached picture)

    让土钢成器  让土铁成材
    河南用土钢造大批机器质量同洋钢差不多
    攸县准备用自己的土钢大造机床武装自己
  新华社郑州9日电　河南省机械工业职工已用本省生产的土钢制造出大批产品。仅据商城、鲁山两个县的机械工厂和郑州农业、纺织两个机械制造学校的统计，用土钢制成的农具、工具、机械设备和配件，就有八百多种，而且质量与洋钢制造的相比，不差上下，很受用户的欢迎。中共河南省委目前正在通过组织全省机械工业广泛使用土钢，来促进机械工业大跃进。
    用土钢制造农具和人民生活用具，在河南各地相当普遍，并有很长的历史。但是不少人认为土钢只能制造这些简单的粗糙的工具，制造机器是不行的。这些问题现在已由实践作出了回答。郑州纺织机械学校用土钢制成了牛头刨床、快速虎钳；郑州工业学校用土钢制成了榨油机、水泵、小钢磨等。经过鉴定，这些产品质量完全合乎标准。
    各地机械工业目前使用的土钢，全系铁炉锻打的。钢锭很小，一般只有一、二公斤重。因此，只能制造小件工具和小型机械及其配件。但是随着土钢质量的提高和轧成钢材，土钢的用途会随着扩大。最近，商城县和郑州机械制造学校、已经用土钢抽出了质量很好的七号和三十二号钢丝。河南省有关部门目前正在积极组织各地生产小型轧钢机，以便把土钢制成小型钢材，如元钢、方钢及线材等，并准备用土拔丝机将一部分小圆钢拔成丝钢，供机械工业制造设备使用。同时，为了进一步提高土钢质量和生产一些较大的中型制件，在有条件的地方，要求采用机械锻打方法，使小钢锭变成大钢坯。
    据据新华社长沙9日电　湖南省攸县农具机械厂的职工，最近用本县出产的土钢和生铁制成皮带车床。为大量利用土钢铁打开了道路，也为机械工业找到了广阔的材料来源。这部四点五尺长的车床的质量很好，目前工人们正用它来大量加工鼓风机的皮带盘、滚珠轴承等机械零件。
    当工人们开始用攸县自产的土钢来制造车床时，因为没有掌握好淬火的时间，土钢经过锻打后还是不耐用，几次打出的毛胚都断了。工人们就采用边淬火边锻打的方法，反复淬火锻打，终于增加了钢的强度，做成了零件。像丝杆、车头的轴等较大的零件，用一块土钢还做不成，工人们就把几块土钢放入炉中加热后再锻打焊合，连续干了两天两夜，都焊合不好。厂长江德瑞便与十一个锻工一起在炉边开会研究，找出了原因是温度还不够高，钢烧得不透。他们就加大风箱，增加燃料，延长烧的时间，最后打成了又直又圆的丝杆等零件毛坯。
    这台车床制成以后，工人们的信心更增强了。他们表示，要在今年内再生产一百部以上的机床，并且保证担负起用机床武装全县的任务。
    据新华社天津9日电　天津市红桥区最近举办的土钢用途展览会，展出了二十多个单位用土钢制出的许多产品，说明土钢大有用途。
    在展品中，有第一工具刃具厂试制成功的三把硬合金切削刀、钢锉、鎯头和翻砂工具等，有天津市科学仪器厂制成的牙轮，有天津市机床修理厂制成的丝杠、螺丝等。这些工具、农具和机器零件，都是用破锅铁等废铁经土炉炼出来的毛钢制造的，质量完全合格。在展览会上还有一些产品是用质量更次的碎铁片和下脚料，经过锻打炼出的土钢制的。（附图片）
