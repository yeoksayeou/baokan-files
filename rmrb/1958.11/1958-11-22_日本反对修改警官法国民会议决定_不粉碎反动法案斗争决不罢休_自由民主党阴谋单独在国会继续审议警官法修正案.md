    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 21st: Representatives from the National Conference Opposing the Evil Revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," including the Japan Socialist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions, and the National Farmers Association, held a meeting of its executive committee in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 20th. The representatives reaffirmed that all groups participating in the National Conference will resolutely struggle until the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" is scrapped.
    The executive committee meeting decided that if the Liberal Democratic Party unilaterally forces the deliberation of this amendment in the Diet, they will take strong practical actions to express their protest. To this end, the National Conference will immediately issue instructions regarding preparatory work so that actions can be taken at any time from November 26th onwards.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 21st: The fifth round of talks between the Japan Socialist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party in Tokyo on the 20th, regarding the settlement of the current Japanese political situation, remained fruitless due to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's continued adoption of a rogue attitude. The Liberal Democratic Party is already brewing plans to unilaterally proceed with the Diet's deliberation work.
    In this round of talks, the Liberal Democratic Party put forward a "suggestion" to treat the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill," the fuse that ignited the current political crisis, as a bill for continued deliberation, and requested that the heads of the two parties conduct direct negotiations.
    These "suggestions" from the Liberal Democratic Party show that it has not abandoned its attempt to forcibly pass this reactionary bill, which is unanimously despised by the Japanese people. The Socialist Party immediately rejected its unreasonable demand.
    The Socialist Party's Diet Policy Committee meeting held on the 20th decided to launch a strong struggle in the Diet to crush the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill." In order to cope with temporarily possible incidents, the meeting also decided to recall Diet members scattered around various places working against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" to Tokyo.
    According to Kyodo News, the Liberal Democratic Party's plot to forcibly pass the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" will proceed with the Diet's deliberation work independently from next week if it fails in the two parties' talks this week. Kyodo News said that there are many people within the Liberal Democratic Party who advocate doing so.
    To this end, Yoshino Shinji, Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party Members' General Assembly in the House of Councillors, and Ino Shigejiro, Secretary-General, went to request the cooperation of the Ryokufukai again on the 20th, hoping to complete the deliberation of the supplementary budget bill on the 21st or 22nd. However, the Ryokufukai once again refused the Liberal Democratic Party's request.

    日本反对修改警官法国民会议决定
    不粉碎反动法案斗争决不罢休
    自由民主党阴谋单独在国会继续审议警官法修正案
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本社会党、日本工会总评议会、全日本工会会议、全日本农民协会联合会等参加反对恶劣修改“警察官职务执行法”国民会议的代表，20日下午在东京召开了干事会会议，代表们再次肯定，参加国民会议的所有团体将坚决进行斗争，不使“警察官职务执行法修正案”成为废案不罢休。
    干事会会议决定，如果自由民主党单方面在国会强行审议这个修正案，他们就要采取强有力的实际行动来表示抗议。为此，国民会议将立即发出关于进行准备工作的指示，以便从11月26日起随时都可以采取行动。
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本社会党和自由民主党20日在东京举行的关于收拾目前日本政局的第五次会谈，由于执政的自由民主党继续采取耍无赖的态度，使得会谈依然毫无结果，自由民主党已经在酝酿单方面进行国会的审议工作。
    自由民主党在这次会谈中提出“建议”，要把引起这次政治危机的导火线的“警察官职务执行法修正案”作为继续审议的法案，并且要求两党首脑直接进行谈判。
    自由民主党的这些“建议”表明，它丝毫也没有放弃它要强行通过这个遭到日本人民一致唾弃的反动法案的企图。社会党当即拒绝了它的这种无理要求。
    社会党20日举行的国会对策委员会会议决定，要在国会展开强有力的粉碎“警察官职务执行法修正案”的斗争；为了能够应付临时可能发生的事变，会议还决定把散在各地进行反对修改“警察官职务执行法”工作的国会议员召回东京。
    据共同社透露，自由民主党企图强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”的阴谋在两党在这个星期的会谈中如果不能得逞，它就要从下个星期单独进行国会的审议工作。共同社说，自由民主党内部有好些人主张这样干。
    为此，参议院自由民主党议员总会会长吉野信次和干事长伊能繁次郎20日又去要求绿风会“实行合作”，希望在21日或22日就审议完补充预算案。但是，绿风会再次拒绝了自由民主党的这一要求。
