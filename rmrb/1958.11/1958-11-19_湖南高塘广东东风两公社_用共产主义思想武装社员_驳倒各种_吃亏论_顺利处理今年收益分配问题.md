    Hunan Gaotang and Guangdong Dongfeng Communes Use Communist Ideology to Arm Commune Members
    Refute Various "Suffering Loss" Arguments and Smoothly Handle This Year's Income Distribution
    (Our Report) The Gaotang People's Commune in Changsha County, Hunan Province, has armed its members with communist ideology, greatly refuted the two "suffering loss" arguments, greatly enhanced the masses' awareness, smoothly handled this year's income distribution, and promoted the winter production great leap forward.
    The Gaotang People's Commune was formed by merging eighty-four small cooperatives from the original four townships of Langli, Liyu, Gaotang, and Changchong. Regarding this year's income, the commune party committee decided to adopt a unified distribution by the large commune, appropriately considering the small cooperatives, and implement a system of food supply and basic wages plus bonuses. The majority of people warmly supported this new distribution method, but a few, mainly wealthier middle peasants, expressed opposition. They believed that with this distribution, richer cooperatives "suffered a loss" and households with more labor and fewer people "suffered a loss." Someone wrote a big-character poster: "The People's Commune is good, but it's a pity it's too big. The difference between rich and poor cooperatives is not small. Our cooperative produces a lot of grain, their cooperative produces little grain. If we want to improve productivity, grain should not be eaten equally." Wu Liangchen, an upper-middle peasant from the Limin Brigade, even frequently went to Changsha City to play without asking for leave. He said, "Now, just eat some food, get some wages, and muddle along."
    The commune party committee analyzed the above situation and believed that it was necessary to rely on the masses, launch a great airing of views, great debate, and use communist ideology to educate the masses in order to do a good job in distribution.
    First, a great debate was launched, with the first question being: Does unified distribution mean that rich cooperatives suffer a loss? Through the debate, everyone realized that no one was taking advantage of anyone else, but rather everyone was benefiting from the collective. The original Tan Yang Cooperative was a rich cooperative with many cash crops and high income. This year, the labor day price reached two yuan. Some people were dissatisfied with the unified distribution, saying: "Other cooperatives have less income. We work hard for a year, but we have to mix it up and distribute it together. Isn't this clearly suffering a loss?" In the debate, everyone cited many facts to show that the reason they were rich was mainly due to the leadership of the Party and the support of the state. In the past, Tan Yang Cooperative was a place where "the Yangjia Mountain was flooded, and rice cost three yuan and three jiao." The lives of most people were poor, and they had not become rich for hundreds of years. Only after embarking on the path of collectivization, relying on collective strength to overcome water and drought disasters, and with the support of state loans and the supply of grain, did they gradually get rid of poverty. At the same time, everyone also listed facts to prove that poor cooperatives can also become rich. Last year, Liyu Cooperative was a third-class cooperative with a rice yield of only 300 jin per mu. This year, under the leadership of the Party, it carried out a people's rectification campaign, boosted morale, and achieved a yield of 1,000 jin per mu for early and mid-season rice, with grain production increasing several times and the labor day price tripling. Isn't this a case of a poor cooperative becoming a rich cooperative? In the end, the conclusion was: We must stand tall and see far. The future of the commune, the future of communism, is the future of everyone.
    The second question debated was: Does the implementation of the food supply system mean that households with more labor and fewer people suffer a loss? When the Quan Jing Brigade debated this question, it not only calculated detailed accounts and compared the present with the future, but more importantly, everyone realized that our labor is for building socialism. Only when everyone with the ability to work contributes all their strength will the social material wealth increase, and everyone's common happy life can be realized. Everyone has a young and old age, and in the future, they will have to rely on social support. When they are young, strong, and able to work, they should work more for society.
    In order to strengthen communist education and do a good job in distribution, the commune also organized a propaganda team of more than 2,000 people, mobilized all propaganda tools, and launched a large-scale propaganda movement. They publicized the superiority of the commune and next year's production plan, greatly encouraging people's enthusiasm for building socialism. In addition, the commune also launched typical ideological discussions, and many people raised their awareness.
    Through the great debate, individualism and departmentalism were despised by the people, and communist ideology was deeply rooted in people's hearts. Cao Chunhua, a female feeder from the Baojia Brigade, moved her bedding to the pigsty and guarded it day and night to ensure that the sow gave birth safely, resulting in the safe birth of forty-eight piglets. The leap in thinking brought about a high tide in production. The commune has completed the autumn harvest and autumn planting, and everyone has also agreed to unified distribution by the large commune. (Huang Keyun, Li Qinyuan)
    (Our Report) The Dongfeng People's Commune in Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province, recently thoroughly criticized bourgeois ideology and vigorously promoted the communist ideological style through a great airing of views and great debate on the issue of the supply system. It thoroughly criticized erroneous arguments such as "the supply system will dampen labor enthusiasm and turn the diligent into lazy and the lazy into immortals."
    The Dongfeng People's Commune decided to implement the supply system in terms of basic living needs. However, some upper-middle peasants raised the argument that "this distribution system will make people with strong labor power suffer." Some people believed that although implementing the supply system would be good in the future, they would "suffer an immediate loss" now. For example, Liang Kailian, an upper-middle peasant, said, "It will take at least twenty years before our income does not decrease!" However, the facts were exactly the opposite of this statement. Poor peasants in Datang Village calculated income comparison accounts for the upper-middle peasants one by one. According to the current supply system level of about nine yuan per person per month, sixteen out of seventeen upper-middle peasant households in the village increased their income, and only Chen Qize, with three laborers in a family of four, temporarily reduced his income a little. However, the commune only needs to complete half of the production plan from now until the first half of next year, and the level of the supply system implemented after July 1 next year will far exceed his original income.
    Then, some people raised a second "reason" against the supply system, saying that "the supply system will dampen labor enthusiasm," and that from then on, "the diligent will become lazy, and the lazy will become immortals." This view was exactly the opposite of the views of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. In order to refute this argument, the cadres and masses of Xuedi Village presented the actual situation of the increased number of people attending work and the good quality of work since the establishment of the commune in their village. They distinguished right from wrong by calculating detailed accounts and presenting the facts. Lin Yuansheng, the platoon leader of the fourth platoon of the Xuedi Village Company, said: "After the Xuedi Village Company abolished the evaluation of work and recording of points, the number of people attending work increased by forty-eight, and the attendance rate often remained at 100%. Moreover, due to the realization of military organization, combat action, and collective living, the actual working time per day was two to three hours more than before. How can you say that the diligent will become lazy?" Then everyone analyzed based on the facts they knew, believing that: First, after the implementation of the supply system, everyone needs the commune to supply them, and everyone needs to work for the commune. Everyone's labor is no longer just for themselves, but for the large commune family. Therefore, the spirit of mutual supervision among the masses will be greatly promoted, and lazy people will find it difficult to escape the eyes of thousands of people. At the same time, people who did not participate in labor in the past are now also attending work because their lives are supplied by the commune; Second, because the commune has implemented military labor organization and combat production actions, everyone must abide by the system and discipline, otherwise they will be criticized. Lazy people can no longer be lazy and will gradually become diligent; Third, after the implementation of the supply system, life is resolved, and the heavy family burden is discarded. Poor and lower-middle peasants will work more actively. The commune cadre Lin Yuankui also calculated a general account to illustrate the huge role that the implementation of the supply system will play in production. He said: "There are more than 18,000 households in the entire commune, and in the past, there were 6,000 households in difficulty that were overspending. About 10,000 laborers were affected by the need to worry about food and clothing and find food and clothing, which affected attendance. Implementing the supply system and removing this burden will increase 500,000 workdays per year, assuming each person does 50 more workdays per year. With each workday worth 7 jiao, 350,000 yuan of wealth will be created. In addition, there are 500 families of miners in the commune who did not attend work in the past, but now they all attend work. Assuming each person does 200 workdays per year, a total of 100,000 workdays, another 70,000 yuan of wealth can be created. These two items add up to a total of 420,000 yuan, which is a huge amount." After such a comparison and calculation, the upper-middle peasants who held the erroneous view that the supply system would affect enthusiasm said that they did not see the power of the masses being sufficient to transform lazy people, let alone the fundamental aspect that the enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants would be even greater. After everyone more clearly recognized that the supply system could maximize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, the argument that "the diligent will become lazy, and the lazy will become immortals" also went bankrupt.
    Through this great debate, the farmers of the entire commune have had their eyes opened, and everyone has a clearer understanding that only through joint efforts can a happier and more prosperous life be realized.

    湖南高塘广东东风两公社  用共产主义思想武装社员
    驳倒各种“吃亏论”  顺利处理今年收益分配问题
    本报讯　湖南省长沙县高塘人民公社以共产主义思想武装社员，大破两个“吃亏”论，大大提高了群众觉悟，顺利地处理了今年的收益分配，推动了冬季生产大跃进。
    高塘人民公社是由原榔梨、黎圫、高塘、长冲等四个乡的八十四小社合并建成的。对于今年的收入，公社党委决定采取由大社统一分配，适当照顾小社，并且实行伙食供给制和基本工资加奖励的制度。对于这个新的分配办法，大多数人热烈拥护，有少数人，主要是富裕中农，却表示反对。他们认为这样分，富社“吃了亏”，劳多人少的户“吃了亏”。有人写了一张大字报：“人民公社好，可惜搞大了。富社与穷社，分别很不少，我社粮食产得多，他社粮食产得少，要想提高生产力，粮食不可平均吃”。利民大队上中农伍亮臣，甚至经常不请假到长沙市去玩。他说：“如今吃点饭，拿点工资，混混算了。”
    公社党委分析了上述情况，认为必须依靠群众，展开大鸣大放大辩论，以共产主义思想教育群众，才能搞好分配工作。
    首先是开展大辩论，辩论的第一个问题是：统一分配富社是否吃了亏？通过辩论，使大家认清了谁也没有占谁的光，而是大家占了集体的光。原潭杨社是一个富社，他们经济作物多，收入大，今年劳动日单价达二元，有的人对统一分配不满意，说：“别的社收入少，我们辛辛苦苦搞一年，却要混在一起分掉，这不是明明白白吃了亏吗？”辩论中大家举出许多事实，说明他们富的原因，主要是党的领导和国家的支援。潭杨社过去是“水淹杨家山，米涨三元三”的地方，大部分人的生活穷困，过去几百年也没有富裕起来，只是在走上合作化道路以后，由于依靠集体力量战胜了水旱灾害，加上国家贷款支持和供应粮食，才逐渐摆脱了贫困。同时，大家也列举事实，证明穷社也可以变富的。黎圫社去年是个三类社，稻谷亩产仅三百斤，今年在党的领导下，进行了全民整风，鼓足了干劲，早中稻亩产达到千斤，粮食产量翻几番，劳动日单价提高三倍，这不是穷社变成了富社吗？最后，得出的结论是：要站得高，看得远，公社的前途，共产主义的前途，就是大家的前途。
    辩论的第二个问题是：实行粮食供给制，劳多人少的户是不是吃亏？泉井大队在辩论这个问题时，不仅算了细账，对现在和将来作了比较；更重要的，是大家认识到，我们的劳动是为了建设社会主义，只有每一个有劳动能力的人，把自己一切力量都贡献出来，社会的物质财富才会越来越多，大家共同美满幸福的日子才能实现。每个人都有小有老的时候，将来都要靠社会供养，年青体壮能劳动的时候，就应该为社会多多劳动。
    为了加强共产主义教育，做好分配工作，这个公社还组织了二千多人的宣传队伍，动员所有宣传工具，开展了规模巨大的宣传运动。宣传公社的优越性和明年的生产规划，大大鼓舞了人们建设社会主义的积极性。此外，公社还开展典型思想讨论，许多人提高了觉悟。
    通过大辩论，个人主义、本位主义受到人们的鄙弃，共产主义思想深入人心。保家大队女饲养员曹春华，为了使母猪安全生崽，把铺盖搬到猪舍里，日夜守护，使母猪安全生下了四十八头猪仔。思想的跃进，带来了生产的高潮，这个公社秋收秋种已经完成，大家也同意按大社统一分配。　（黄科云、李沁沅）
    本报讯　广东省阳江县东风人民公社最近通过供给制问题的大鸣大放大辩论，痛剿资产阶级思想，大刮共产主义思想之风，对“供给制会打击劳动积极性，使勤人变懒，懒汉变神仙”等错误论调进行了彻底批判。
    东风人民公社决定在基本生活需要方面实行供给制。但是，一部分上中农却提出了“这种分配制度会使劳动力强的人吃亏”的说法。有人认为实行供给制将来虽好，现在可吃了“眼前亏”。如上中农梁开连说：“要等到我们不减少收入，起码还要二十年啦！”可是事实和这种说法恰恰相反，大塘村贫农为此给上中农逐个算了收入对比账。按照现定每人每月约九元的供给制水平，全村十七户上中农中有十六户增加了收入，只有全家四口三个劳动力的陈启泽暂时减少一点收入。但是，公社只需完成从现在起到明年上半年生产计划的一半，明年“七一”以后实行的供给制水平就要远远超过他原来的收入。
    接着有人又提出反对供给制的第二个“理由”，说“供给制会打击劳动积极性”，又说从此“勤人会变懒，懒汉变神仙”。这种看法恰恰和广大贫农、下中农群众的看法相反。学地村的干部和群众为了驳倒这种论调，将本村在建立公社以后出勤人数增加，工作质量良好的实际情况摆出来，通过算细账，摆事实，分清了是非。学地村连队第四排排长林元圣说：“学地村连队取消评工记分后，出勤人数增加了四十八人，出勤率经常保持100％，而且由于实现了组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化，每天实际劳动时间比以前多了二、三个钟头，这怎么能说勤人会变懒呢？”接着大家都根据各自知道的事实进行分析，认为：第一、实行供给制后，人人要社供给，人人就要为社劳动，每个人的劳动已不光为了自己，而是为了公社大家庭。所以群众的互相监督精神就会大大发扬起来，懒惰的人就难以躲过千百双眼睛。同时，过去不参加劳动的人这下生活由公社供给也开始出勤了；第二、因为公社实行了劳动组织军事化，生产行动战斗化，人人要遵守制度和纪律，否则给予批评，懒汉再也偷懒不了，就会逐渐变得勤快；第三，实行供给制后，生活得到解决，丢掉了沉重的家庭包袱，贫农和下中农就会更加积极劳动。社干部林元魁还算了一笔总账来说明实行供给制将在生产上所发挥的巨大作用。他说：“全公社有一万八千多户，过去有六千户超支的困难户，约有一万个劳动力因为愁吃愁穿、找吃找穿而影响出勤。实行供给制，卸掉这个包袱，以每人每年多做五十个工作日计，一年就能增加五十万个工作日，以每个工作日值七角计算，就创造了三十五万元财富。另外，全社有五百个矿工家属，过去不出勤，现在都出勤了，以每人每年做二百个工作日计算，共十万工作日，又可创造价值七万元的财富。这两条加起来，一共四十二万元，这是一笔何等巨大的数目。”经过这样一比一算之后，持有所谓供给制影响积极性的错误看法的上中农都说，他们没看到群众的力量足以改造懒汉，更看不到广大贫农和下中农积极性会更加大的根本一面。在大家更加明确认识到供给制能够最大限度地发挥广大群众积极性之后，“勤人会变懒，懒汉变神仙”的论调又随着破产了。
    全公社的农民通过这次大辩论，眼光豁然开朗了，大家更加清楚地懂得了只有共同努力，才能实现更加幸福和更加富裕的生活。
