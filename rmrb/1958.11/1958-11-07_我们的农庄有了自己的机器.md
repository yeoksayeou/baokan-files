Our Farm Has Its Own Machines
I. Kovalenko, Chairman of the "Lenin" Collective Farm, Sinelnikov District, Dnepropetrovsk Oblast

The current agricultural year is drawing to a close. For us, the collective farmers of the Soviet Union, this year has been quite extraordinary. For the first time, we are cultivating the land with our own machinery and equipment, relying on our own machines.

As everyone knows, the state-owned Machine Tractor Stations played a tremendous role in the development of the collective farm system. It is no exaggeration to say that without the Machine Tractor Stations, the production of collective farms could not have been raised to such a high level, and such great achievements could not have been made. Our collective farm named after Lenin is a very convincing example. For instance, last year we sowed a total of 5,200 hectares of land. These fields were all cultivated by machine operators using the machines of the Machine Tractor Stations. The harvest results themselves powerfully demonstrate the high level of cultivation. For example, on 2,657 hectares of land, the average grain yield reached more than 25 quintals per hectare.

Before the start of spring field work, our farm purchased 22 tractors, 10 grain harvesters, 7 corn harvesters, 4 forage harvesters, and all the necessary farm implements. These machines are worth 877,000 rubles. This figure is indeed not small, but our collective farm is not poor. Generally speaking, there are no poor farms in our Ukraine. Last year, our collective farm's income was 8,275,000 rubles. This allowed us to pay the state more than 500,000 rubles this year for the purchase of agricultural machinery. We think that we will be able to pay off this expense in full by next year. A large group of experienced machine operators, such as tractor drivers, harvester operators, and mechanics, voluntarily transferred from the Machine Tractor Stations to our farm along with the machines and became farm members.

In this way, the masters of our collective farm became the full owners of a large number of machines. The benefits of the collective farm having its own machines are clearly manifested in the further development of production. This year, we worked with unprecedented political and production enthusiasm. We sowed 3,200 hectares with grain crops alone. We used our own machines on our own fertile land and achieved a bumper harvest. The wheat we harvested on a much larger land area than last year averaged one quintal more per hectare than last year. The corn harvest was even better. We harvested 35 quintals of corn per hectare from 950 hectares of land. In addition, we sowed green fodder and silage fodder on 600 hectares of land.

With agricultural machinery and equipment, skilled technical leadership is essential. A young man who had just graduated from an engineering technical college came to the farm. Now we are beginning to systematically implement thorough mechanization in all departments of the farm, especially animal husbandry. This requires a great deal of effort. Our collective farm has seven livestock farms. These farms have 2,200 head of cattle, including 670 dairy cows; 2,150 pigs, 1,600 sheep, and 13,000 poultry.

The collective farm has its own motor transport team. Now we have a total of 14 trucks and one sedan. This is slightly insufficient for our farm. But this small motorcade of ours has done a lot of things. This year, it transported a total of 67,000 quintals of grain, 21,000 quintals of tuber crops, 120,000 quintals of silage stalk fodder, and a large amount of building materials.

The work in the first few months of this year has shown that agricultural machinery has been handed over to reliable people. In the near future, we will strive to master these diverse machines perfectly, gain experience in leading mechanized production, and move forward more rapidly along the road of vigorously consolidating the collective farm system.

    我们的农庄有了自己的机器
    第聂伯彼得罗夫斯克州塞涅尔尼可夫区“列宁”集体农庄主席  伊·科瓦连科
    本农业年度已近尾声。对于我们苏联的集体农民说来，这一年很不平常。我们第一次按照新的办法，用自己的机器设备，依靠自己的机器来进行耕作。
    大家知道，在发展集体农庄制度方面国营的机器拖拉机站曾起了多么巨大的作用。可以毫不夸张地说，没有机器拖拉机站，集体农庄的生产就不可能提到这样高的水平，就不会取得这样大的成绩。我们以列宁命名的这个集体农庄就是一个很能说服人的例子。例如在去年，我们一共播种了五千二百公顷田地。这些田地都是由机器操使者们用机器拖拉机站的机器耕作的。收获结果本身有力地说明了耕作的高度水平。例如在二千六百五十七公顷土地上，谷物每公顷的收获量平均达到二十五公担以上。
    在春季田间工作开始以前，我们农庄购买了二十二部拖拉机、十部谷物收割机、七部玉米收割机、四部秣草收割机和全部必须的农具。这些机器价值八十七万七千卢布。这个数字确实不小，可是我们的集体农庄并不穷。一般说，在我们乌克兰，贫穷的农庄是没有的。去年我们集体农庄的收入是八百二十七万五千卢布。这使我们能在今年为购买农业机器支付给国家五十多万卢布。我们想，到下一年就能把这笔费用全部偿清。一大批有经验的机器操使者，如拖拉机手、收割机手、机械师都随着机器按照自愿原则由机器拖拉机站转到我们的农庄，并且变成农庄庄员了。
    这样，我们集体农庄的主人就成为大量机器的全权主人。集体农庄有机器的好处，在生产的进一步发展上明显地表现出来。今年我们以空前的政治和生产热情进行了工作。仅是谷类作物就播种了三千二百公顷。我们用自己的机器在自己的肥沃的土地上取得了丰收。我们在比去年大得多的土地面积上收获的小麦，每公顷平均比去年多一公担。玉米的收成还要好。在九百五十公顷的土地上从每公顷收了三十五公担玉米。此外还在六百公顷土地上播种了绿色饲料和青贮饲料。
    由于有了农业机器设备，因此就必须有熟练的技术领导。一个刚从工程技术专科大学毕业的年轻小伙子来到了农庄。现在我们开始使农庄所有部门，特别是畜牧业，有计划地实行彻底的机械化。在这方面需要很大的努力。我们集体农庄有七个畜牧场。在这些牧场有两千二百头牛，其中有六百七十头乳牛；还有二千一百五十只猪，一千六百只羊和一万三千只家禽。
    集体农庄有自己的汽车运输队。现在我们共有十四部载重汽车和一部轿车。对于本农庄说来，这稍嫌不足。但是我们的这个小小的汽车队却做了很多事情。今年它一共运输了六万七千公担谷物二万一千公担块茎作物、十二万公担青贮茎秆饲料和大量建筑材料。
    今年头几个月的工作就表明，农业机器是交到了可信赖的人的手里。在最近时期我们就要努力争取完善地掌握这些多种多样的机器，取得对机械化生产的领导经验，并以更快的速度沿着全力巩固集体农庄制度的道路前进。
