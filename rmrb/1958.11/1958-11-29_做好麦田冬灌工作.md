    Do a Good Job of Winter Irrigation for Wheat Fields
    Commentator of this newspaper
    Strengthening the early management of wheat fields is an important task in current agricultural production. Among the early management tasks for wheat fields, winter irrigation is an important measure.
    Practice has proven that under conditions of deep plowing, heavy fertilization, and close planting, there are new requirements for irrigation water; the old experience of "five irrigations and three fertilizations," which was considered good in the past, is no longer fully suitable for high-yielding fields. According to the experience of wheat fields with high yields and high-yield satellite fields in 1958, from sowing to maturity, in the Yellow River basin area of North China, it is generally necessary to irrigate seven or eight times, or even more than ten times. A survey of the irrigation experience of nineteen high-yield satellite fields in Henan Province showed that irrigation ranged from seven to ten times. The satellite field of Heping Cooperative in Chengguan Town, Xiping County, the province, which produced 7,320 jin of wheat per mu, was "eight irrigations and six fertilizations."
    Based on the irrigation experience of previous years, winter irrigation is a crucial irrigation for obtaining increased production. This is because winter irrigation has the dual effect of storing water and retaining warmth, which not only protects wheat for safe overwintering, but also provides the necessary nutrients and moisture for growth and development in the later stages of overwintering. Next year, there will be higher requirements for wheat production targets, and all regions are universally engaged in large-scale high-yielding satellite field movements. Using the experience of high-yield irrigation water in 1958 is of utmost importance for ensuring a greater leap forward in wheat production next year.
    All regions paid attention to the issue of irrigation water for wheat fields earlier and made arrangements for winter irrigation. Anhui Province, where winter irrigation habits were not widespread in the past, also proposed a winter irrigation task of more than 33 million mu this year. Xinjiang, Gansu, and northern Shaanxi, where freezing occurs earlier, have already begun winter irrigation. Currently, the temperature in the north is gradually decreasing, and the time for freezing is not far away. The winter irrigation season has arrived, and all regions must immediately take action, seize the opportunity, and take measures to generally winter irrigate all wheat fields once or twice before freezing, except for areas with high groundwater levels and high soil moisture content.
    In order to complete the task of universal winter irrigation of all wheat fields, first, a survey and calculation should be carried out based on the water demand of the irrigated wheat field area and the water supply capacity of water conservancy facilities. Actively do a good job in the repair of projects and water lifting tools, and do everything possible to tap the potential of water sources to strive for more irrigation. For wheat fields that do not yet have water conservancy facilities, it is even more necessary to speed up the construction of projects in advance and put them into winter irrigation. Under the premise of ensuring the universal winter irrigation of 70 million mu of wheat, Shandong Province closely combined with water conservancy construction work, called on the masses to divert water, store water, and develop groundwater, which effectively promoted winter irrigation work.
    In order to carry out winter irrigation work quickly and well, doing a good job of field irrigation ditches and furrows is an important condition. This year, many areas have carried out intensive farming of wheat fields, and the area of garden-style irrigation has greatly developed. On the land where garden-style farming has been realized, it has truly achieved "the ground is as flat as a mirror, and the ridges are as straight as a line." However, judging from the overall situation, the proportion of garden-style area is not high enough, and the progress of furrowing work is not fast enough. For example, in Hebei Province, the quality of furrowing in about 50% of wheat fields is not good enough, and in Shaanxi Province, more than 30% of irrigated wheat fields still need to be furrowed. At present, for wheat fields lacking irrigation ditches and furrows, inter-row furrowing and the digging of water conveyance furrows should be carried out quickly to ensure uniform water reception during irrigation and improve irrigation efficiency.
    Winter irrigation work must also be closely combined with mid-cultivation and top dressing. Under normal circumstances, fertilizer should be applied when water arrives, and the fertilizer and water should be sufficient to accelerate fertilizer decomposition and supply crops for absorption and utilization in a timely manner. In order to improve the soil's water retention capacity and prevent surface hardening and cracking after irrigation, attention should be paid to plowing or applying organic fertilizer after irrigation.

    做好麦田冬灌工作
    本报评论员
    加强麦田的早期管理，是当前农业生产中的一项重要事情。在麦田早期管理工作当中，冬灌又是一项重要措施。
    实践证明：在深翻、多肥、密植的条件下，对灌溉用水有了新的要求；过去认为较好的“五水三肥”的老经验已经不能完全适合高额丰产田的要求了。根据1958年小麦丰产田及高产卫星田的灌溉用水经验，由播种到成熟，在华北的黄河流域地区，一般要浇水七、八次，甚至有十次以上的。河南省对十九个高产卫星田灌水经验的调查：灌水都在七到十次之间，该省西平县城关镇和平社亩产小麦七千三百二十斤的卫星田是“八水六肥”。
    根据历年来的灌水经验，冬灌水是一次获得增产的关键水。这是因为冬灌有储水保温的双重作用，既能保护小麦安全越冬，又为越冬后期生长发育提供必需的养分与水分。明年对小麦增产指标有更高的要求，各地又普遍大搞大面积高额丰产卫星田运动，运用1958年丰产灌溉用水的经验，对确保明年小麦生产更大跃进有极重要的意义。
    各地对麦田的灌溉用水问题注意较早，对冬灌工作也进行了安排，过去群众冬灌习惯不普遍的安徽省，今年也提出三千三百多万亩的麦田冬灌任务。封冻较早的新疆、甘肃及陕北地区，已经开始冬灌。目前北方气温逐渐降低，封冻的时间为期不远，冬灌季节已经到来，各地必须立即行动起来，抓紧时机，采取措施，除地下水位高，土壤含水量大的地区外，要把全部麦田在封冻前普遍冬灌一、二次。
    为了完成全部麦田普遍冬灌的任务，首先应根据灌溉麦田面积的需水要求及水利设施的供水能力，进行查算，积极做好工程及提水工具的整修，千方百计挖掘水源潜力争取多灌。对于还没有水利设施的麦田，更要提前加快赶修工程，投入冬灌。山东省在保证七千万亩小麦普遍冬灌的要求下，密切结合水利兴修工作，号召群众引水、蓄水、开发地下水，有力的推动了冬灌工作。
    为了把冬灌工作进行得又快又好，做好田间灌水沟畦是一个重要的条件。今年不少地区对麦田进行了精耕细作，灌溉园田化的面积有很大发展，在实现园田化的土地上真是作到了“地平如镜，畦埂如线”。但是从总的情况看，园田化的面积比重还不够高，打畦工作进展的不够快，如河北省就约有50％的麦田的打畦质量还不够好，陕西省还有30％多的水浇麦田尚待打畦。目前应对缺少灌水沟畦的麦田，赶快进行垅间补畦和开挖输水垅沟，保证灌水时受水均匀。提高灌水效率。
    冬灌工作还必须与中耕、追肥密切结合，一般情况应该肥到水到，肥大水足，以加速肥料分解及时供给作物吸收利用。为了提高土壤保墒能力防止灌后地面板结、裂缝，要注意灌后的耕耙或加盖有机肥料等。
