    ——Literary Appreciation Essays

    A cartoonist selected some relatively mature peasant paintings from Pixian County, made modifications to varying degrees, and had them printed by Rong Bao Zhai using watermark techniques. The overall title is "Hebi Collection." The cooperation between professional art workers and mass art workers is just like the way filmmakers treat labor model Huang Baomei and her comrades (inviting them to play the main role of "Huang Baomei"), which is a very welcome and commendable revolutionary attitude and revolutionary method. Although this preliminary attempt still has shortcomings, it can be definitely affirmed that when painters have gained experience, a large number of works combining the advantages of professional and amateur painters will emerge in the new Chinese art scene. Comrade Hua Junwu, who participated in this work, published an article in the Guangming Daily on October 5, talking about his experience in adapting peasant paintings, titled "Don't Assume Superiority in Improvement." The spirit of the article and the title itself do not suggest that this attempt has already been successful.

    Many peasant creations recommended by many newspapers and periodicals in the past two months not only have very good creative ideas, but also have unique forms of expression. Some of these forms are even more peculiar than ancient paintings such as the Han Dynasty brick relief "Shooting Geese and Harvesting" (unearthed in Chengdu). The use of this peculiar form is by no means to cover up their ignorance and indifference to real life, but a requirement put forward to them by a mythical reality, that is, a demand of the people inspired by a mythical reality. Peculiar forms are by no means formalism for the peasants' creation. It seems that it is impossible to talk about the accuracy and authenticity of the image without painting in this way. Forcibly imitating natural phenomena cannot fully express their romantic creative intentions. Even if the external form is as accurate as a photograph, the use of its form is still formalism. It should be the cartoonist who is most unwilling to be constrained by natural forms. Judging from what was changed and what was added when adapting peasant paintings, I feel that the cartoonist has also failed to avoid being vulgar, and has been contaminated (or has not completely eliminated) an influence from so-called formal art education, and dare not deny those unrealistic improvement standards or specifications. It is precisely this standard or specification that is at work, which has failed to deeply understand the superiority of mass creation, and has affected the artistic quality of the adaptation (some have therefore weakened the ideological content of the works and reduced their political power). It seems that this involves issues such as the standard of improvement, the understanding of mass creation, and the feelings in life.

    "Flaming Mountains" is an excellent peasant painting from Pixian County that has been published in many newspapers and periodicals. People love this painting not because of anything else, but because it creatively and uniquely expresses the ideals, confidence, and drive of people with communist ideas in transforming nature. It is not necessary to depict how the people are bravely producing and laboring, but the achievements created by the people themselves are full of heroic spirit, magnificent and grand. Several stoves and flames occupy the entire screen, and the screen is filled with these things, not allowing anything else to intervene. This composition is even bolder than the solid-in-the-void composition of landscape painter Huang Binhong. It is worth noting that the important figure in the legend, the Monkey King, does not occupy an important position in this painting; it is almost invisible without looking closely. Generally speaking, it is impossible not to highlight this hero in the picture. However, in this painting, the Monkey King is not very noticeable, which exactly fits the theme of the work. I don't know which school of composition the peasants are based on. Perhaps the spiritual encouragement of real life is their highest standard of composition; the seemingly clumsy but actually ingenious composition, arranging three not-very-varied earth kilns in parallel, plus strong flames (only this one color is used on the screen besides the ink lines), creates a full and full picture. The things in it seem to have the power to extend outwards, making people feel that what the Monkey King is facing is truly a boundless Flaming Mountains. Such a composition is very suitable for the spirit of the Great Leap Forward and the heroic feelings of the people. The adaptation called "Monkey King as the Flaming Mountains" has a more regular composition, but it has become more general; the characters are drawn more prominently, but the subject and object are reversed; the flames are drawn more meticulously, but there is no original energy; the number of stoves has been increased, but it lacks the original stable atmosphere. … Speaking of Monkey King alone, the Monkey King in the adaptation is obviously drawn more vividly and realistically. However, highlighting the Monkey King shifts the focus. This is obviously not good for the embodiment of the theme of the work. As a cartoon, I think that if the adaptation can avoid highlighting the Monkey King, but instead draw it in a helpless manner, instead of drawing it as trying to fan the fire, it may be more helpful to the expression of the theme idea, and it is also more interesting and more humorous as required by cartoons.

    The shortcomings of the adaptations of "Harvest Overwhelming the Tide Watchers", "Corn Trees Piercing the Sky" and "Technical Innovation, Accelerating Speed" are even more obvious. The original mighty momentum of "Harvest Overwhelming the Tide Watchers", which is composed of rice waves generally impacting, and the strong pressure on the tide watchers from the feeling, have all been changed in the adaptation. It seems that the cartoonist believes that the size and color brightness of rice grains are more important than the surging momentum like sea waves; however, because the power like sea waves is lost, the concreteness of the environment is not clear, and the image of the tide watchers falling backwards seems a bit artificial. In the original "Corn Trees Piercing the Sky", there is only one "tree". Although there is only one, the audience will not think that it is not a representative of many trees. It seems that the cartoonist regards refined artistic techniques as simplification, and pursues "the more the better", adding several more trees during the adaptation. The original simple composition is now changed to be cumbersome. The original prominent image has now been changed to be mediocre. The sense of piercing the sky formed by the basic shape of the vertical line in the composition of the tower-like piercing corn trees, just like the power formed by flames and rice waves, is the personification of the people's ideals, confidence, and pride in conquering nature, which is the life of this work, and must not be cancelled. Because these basic characteristics were ignored, although the corn trees were drawn in the clouds, the result became square and stable, and the charm was greatly reduced. Drawing the plane larger is to make the corn tree smaller in contrast. If this is not sloppy, it can only be said that the cartoonist regards the advantages of the original as shortcomings. The original "Technical Innovation, Accelerating Speed" is more symbolic than other works. The people, horses, and carts on the screen are only used as metaphors, and are leads to guide the audience to understand the basic content of the work (to carry out technical revolution quickly), rather than the main body. Compared with the people, horses, and carts in the circus, the people, carts, and horses in this painting are not particularly important in themselves. The more concrete these things are drawn, the more they will hinder the corresponding association of the audience, and the more they will restrain the audience's attention on the symbolic objects on the screen itself. The adaptation, on the contrary, puts effort into the appearance of people, horses, and carts, and the result is a bit of emphasizing the sketch of the circus scene with decorative interest. Although you can understand its content by reading the text in the picture, it is not as interesting. These works make people feel that peasant paintings are creations, but now it seems that they should be closer to the material. Peasant paintings are poetry, and now after a change, the poetic meaning is also weakened.

    In Chinese painting theory, there is such a saying: "The more hidden the scenery, the greater the realm; the more exposed the scenery, the smaller the realm." It is beneficial for cartoonists who do not intend to paint old-fashioned landscapes to look at such painting theories analytically. This statement is not only related to the richness of the image of the work, but also related to the profundity of the thought of the work. Peasant paintings such as "Flaming Mountains" are consistent with such painting theories. Just like many paintings in the Han Dynasty, although they are a bit clumsy, inconsiderate, and even make anatomical errors…, the content it contains is much more than what is "said". Seeking perfection in the details does not necessarily strengthen the charm of the work; because it does not enrich the content contained in the image. Just as the size of the painting does not determine whether the image is great and solemn, the complexity of the image and the richness of the content are not necessarily proportional. Unnecessary additions and leaves are not necessarily an improvement of the original, but sometimes make the image poor and the thought powerless.

    In the art world, it is still easy to hear a word about improvement: the integrity of the image. What is the integrity of the image? This concept is often used as a concept such as accuracy and verisimilitude. The so-called integrity often does not refer to the image being simpler than the real phenomenon, but just as complicated. Originally, an image that is more typical, more ideal, and more universal than real phenomena can only be a refined image. A simplified image should be recognized as a complete image. Since it is an image, it is certainly not a formula that has lost its concreteness and individuality, but it is nothing more than not an "purely objective" and "realistic" description of the object. Only a refined image is typical, and can fully embody the artist's thought to be embodied. Leaving the theme of the work, the important basis for judging whether the image is complete is lost. Leaving the theme of the work, there is no way to judge whether the created image is real. Contrary to naturalism, this is the requirement of realism for the image, and it can also be said to be the standard of improvement for realistic creation. Precisely because the condition that determines whether the image is complete does not lie in the complexity of the external form, we sometimes highly praise the meticulous fine brushwork paintings and oil paintings, and sometimes highly praise the refined ink paintings and cartoons, although some people find it strange, it is not contradictory. Precisely because the realistic image may not only be a "lifelike" and "accurate" image like a photo, cartoons are not expelled from the art world and treated as formalism. However, influenced by the prejudices of bourgeois art education, the integrity of the image is misinterpreted, the requirements of artistic creation are reversed, and it is believed that the closer the shape is to the natural form, the more complete the shape is. Under the influence of this prejudice, the fallacy of national art tradition nihilism has a market. Even mass creations that deeply express the spirit of the times and the spirit of new characters are often treated as "unacceptable" things. Saying good things on the lips, but not really liking them in the heart. Precisely because of this, the combination of revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism has become a problem that is not easy to understand in the plastic arts. Precisely because of this, vulgar treatment of reality and distorted reality of naturalism can sometimes wear the cloak of realism and deceive naive viewers. It is worth considering that: it should be the cartoonist who dares to fantasize, dares to fictionalize, and is not affected by the above-mentioned prejudices, why there is a deviation when adapting peasant creations, which shows how far-reaching the above-mentioned prejudices are.

    Adapting peasant works seems to be more difficult than the original creation of peasants. The important reason for this is not only that cartoonists have not fully recognized the advantages of peasant creations, but also that cartoonists lack the superior conditions for peasants in the preparation for creation. Why are peasants, who lack experience in art creation, so free when they create? Because they personally participated in the struggle to conquer nature and truly tasted the sweetness and bitterness of labor. Whether it is accumulating fertilizer, burning fertilizer, or composting fertilizer, whether it is repairing canals, digging wells, or drawing water up the mountains, they have experienced many twists and turns, so the joy caused by abundant production is particularly deep, and the future prospects are seen particularly clearly. In a word: peasants take their deep feelings as the source of creation, and the object they want to "modify" is not the works of others, but their own deep feelings from life. Peasant creations may only express one-thousandth of the feelings they have gained in life. Cartoonists who love peasant creations, although they have higher technical accomplishments, and indeed have made new achievements during the adaptation (such as the depiction of the mental state of the characters in works such as "Soybeans Crossing the River"), their creative source almost only relies on the original peasant works, and lacks corresponding materials that can be supplemented and replaced, and the so-called integrity and other stereotypes are still at work, so they often can only dress up the finished product to make it look better. If it is not done well, it will mess up the finished product. If it can be said that the creative idea of ​​peasants is the seed, and the processing of cartoonists is sunlight, moisture, and fertilizer, then all of this, like the peasants obtaining the idea of ​​creation, can only rely on the corresponding life practice. It can be seen that participating in labor training is not only for the ideological transformation of artists, but also for the ideological transformation of art, and for the improvement of the quality of art creation. Just talking about changing the so-called stereotype of integrity also requires learning from peasants; learning how they obtain creative inspiration from real life, and learning how they concentrate on what they think is important. Having the same deep joy of labor as peasants in labor will not only make painting less laborious, but also may produce good works of a higher level than amateur creation. Revolutionary romanticism is not a kind of boastful remark without a basis in life. Drawing pumpkins or sweet potatoes very large is not romanticism; romanticism can only grow out of the soil that has been deeply cultivated by revolutionaries. The peasant's eulogy cartoons are obviously not like sketching, which is a technique that can be learned with skill, but a kind of "instinct" cultivated from life practice. Whether it is to cooperate with peasants or to improve one's own creative quality, one can only work hard from the reality that produces the works, and it is difficult to find a more convenient road.
                                                                                                                                                        (1958, 10, 30)

    完整不完整？
    ——文艺欣赏随笔
    王朝闻
    漫画家选了一部分较成熟的邳县农民画，作了程度不同的修改，由荣宝斋水印出版，总的名称叫做“合璧集”。专业美术工作者与群众美术工作者合作，好比电影工作者对待劳动模范黄宝妹及其战友（请她们担任“黄宝妹”的主要演员）一样，是一种非常值得欢迎的、十分值得提倡的革命态度，革命的办法。这一次的初步尝试虽然还有缺点，可是完全可以肯定：当画家们有了经验之后，新中国画坛将出现大批结合了专业画家与业余画家的优点的作品。参加这一工作的华君武同志，在10月5日的光明日报上发表了一篇文章，谈他改作农民画的体会，标题叫做“不要自居提高”。文章精神和标题一样，不是说这一次的尝试是已经成功了的。
    前两个月许多报刊推荐过的许多农民创作，不只是有很好的创造设想，也有独特的表现形式。这种形式，有的较之汉画象塼“射雁和收获”（成都出土）等古代绘画还要奇特得多。这种奇特的形式的运用，绝不是为了掩饰他们对于现实生活的无知和冷淡，而是神话般的现实向他们提出来的要求，也就是由于神话般的现实所激发了的人民的要求。奇特的形式对农民的创造说来，绝不是形式主义的。似乎不这样画就谈不到形象的准确和真实。硬要模仿自然现象，不能充分表现其浪漫主义的创造意图，即使外形准确到了照像一般，其形式的使用反而是形式主义的。应该是最不愿受自然形态所拘的漫画家，在改画农民画的时候，从改掉了什么和添加了什么来看，我觉得漫画家也未能免俗，沾染了（或还未完全消除）一种来自所谓正规艺术教育的影响，不敢否定那种不太切合实际的提高标准或规格。正是这种标准或规格在作怪，才未能深刻了解群众创作的优越性，影响了改作的艺术质量（有的因此也就削弱了作品的思想内容，减低了政治的力量）。看样子，这里包含着提高的标准、对群众创作的认识和在生活中的感受等问题。
    “火焰山”是在许多报刊上发表过的一幅出色的邳县农民画。人们喜爱这幅画，不是因为别的，因为它创造性地风格独特地表现了拥有共产主义思想的人民，在改造自然时的理想、信心和干劲。不一定画出勇往直前的人民正在怎样生产、劳动，但是人民创造出来的成果本身，也就是充满了英雄气概的，是雄伟和壮阔的。几个炉子和火焰占据了整个画面，画面被这些东西布满，再不容许别的东西插足。这种构图，比山水画家黄宾虹的实中见虚的构图，显得还要大胆得多。很值得注意的一点，是传说中的重要人物齐天大圣，在这幅画上不占重要地位；不近前看几乎是看不见他。一般说来，不让这位英雄在画面上突出是不成的。可是在这一幅画里，齐天大圣不太引人注意，恰好吻合作品的主题。不知道农民根据的是那家那派的构图法，也许现实生活对于他们精神上的鼓舞就是他们构图的最高标准；好像笨拙其实巧妙的章法，平列地摆着三个不是很有变化的土窑，加上强烈的火焰（除了墨线，画面上只用了这一种色），造成了画面的充实饱满。其中的东西似有向外延伸的力量，使人觉得齐天大圣所面对着的，真是无边无际的火焰山。这样的构图和大跃进的时代精神非常合适，和人民豪迈的感情非常合适。名叫“孙悟空当作火焰山”的改作，构图更规矩但也就变得一般化了；人物画得更突出但也就宾主颠倒了；火焰画得更细致可是没有原作那股子劲头了；增加了炉子的数量，可是缺乏原作那种稳重的气派。……单说孙悟空吧，改作里的孙悟空，显然画得生动多了，真实多了。可是把孙悟空画得很突出，重点转移了。这显然对于作品的主题的体现没有好处。当成漫画来看，我以为如果改作能不让孙悟空突出，而是画成无可奈何的样子，不是画成正在努力扇火的样子，可能更有助于主题思想的表现，也是更有趣，更有漫画所需要的幽默感的。
    “丰收卷倒观潮人”、玉米树钻天和“技术革新、快上加快”，改作的缺点还更明显些。“丰收卷倒观潮人”原作那种由稻子构成的海浪一般冲击的威势，从感觉上给观潮者的强大的压力，在改作里都改掉了。似乎，漫画家认为稻粒的大小和色彩明暗，较之海浪似的冲劲更重要；可是因为丧失了海浪一般的威力，环境的具体性不鲜明，观潮派向后跌倒的形象反而显得有点做作了。玉米树钻天里的“树”，原作只有一株。虽然只有一株，观众不会以为它不是许多株的代表。似乎，漫画家把洗炼的艺术手法看成是简单化，追求的是“多多益善”，改作时加上好几株。本来是单纯的构图，现在被改得繁琐了。本来是重点鲜明的形象，现在改得平淡无奇了。像塔一般的钻天的玉米树，在构图上垂直线的基本形所构成的钻天之感，正如火焰和稻浪所形成的威力那样，是人民征服自然的理想、信心和得意感情的形象化，也就是这件作品的生命之所在，万万取消不得的。因为不顾这些基本特点，虽然把玉米树画在云上，结果变成四平八稳，魅力大减了。把飞机画大，相形之下就是把玉米树改小了。这，如果不是马虎，只能说是因为漫画家把原作的优点当成缺点的缘故。原作“技术革新、快上加快”，较之其他作品，更是象征味的。画面上的人、马和车，只是一种作为比喻的东西来使用的，是诱导观众认识作品基本内容（快快地搞技术革命）的引线，而不是主体。较之马戏场上的人、马和车，这幅画中的人、车和马，本身并没有特别重要的意义。这些事物画得愈具体，愈会妨碍观众相应的联想，愈会把观众的注意牵制在画面上的象征物本身。改作，反而在人、马和车的外形上用功夫，结果有点是强调了装饰趣味的马戏场面的写生。看了图中的文字虽然也能了解它的内容，可是就不见得那么有趣了。这些作品使人觉得：农民画是创作，现在似乎要它接近素材。农民画是诗，现在一改把诗意也削弱了。
    在中国画论里，有这样的说法：“景愈藏，境界愈大；景愈露，境界愈小。”有分析地看待这样的画论，对于并非打算画老式山水的漫画家也有益。这种说法不只关系作品的形象的丰富，也关系作品思想的深刻。“火焰山”等农民画是和这样的画论相通的。正如汉代的许多绘画，虽然有点笨拙，不周到，甚至犯了解剖学……的错误，可是它所包含的内容比“说”出来的多得多。在枝节的地方求全，不见得就加强了作品的魅力；因为并不因此就丰富了形象所包含的内容。正如画幅的大小不决定形象是否伟大和庄严一样，形象的复杂性和内容的丰富性不见得都成正比例的。不必要的加枝加叶，不见得是原作的提高，有时反而使形象贫乏，思想无力。
    在美术界，至今还容易听见有关提高的一个词：形象的完整性。什么叫做形象的完整性呢？这一概念，常常是当成准确性、逼真性之类的概念来使用的。所谓完整，往往不是指形象较之现实的现象更单纯，而是一样繁杂。本来，较之现实现象更典型、更理想、更有普遍性的形象，只能是经过提炼的形象。单纯化了的形象，应该承认就是完整的形象，既然是形象，当然不是丧失了具体性和个性的公式，无非不是对象的“纯客观”的“如实的”描写就是了。只有提炼过的形象才是典型，也才能够充分体现艺术家所要体现的思想。离开了作品的主题，也就丧失了判断形象是不是完整的重要根据，离开了作品的主题，无从判断创作的形象是不是真实。和自然主义相反，这，就是现实主义对于形象的要求，也可以说就是现实主义创作的提高标准。正因为决定形象是不是完整的条件，不在于外形的繁简，所以我们有时非常称赞造形细致的工笔画和油画，有时又非常称赞笔墨洗炼的水墨画和漫画，虽然有人觉得奇怪，却并不是矛盾的。正因为现实主义的形象未必只能是照像一样“逼真”和“准确”的形象，所以漫画才不至于被开除出艺坛，当成形式主义来对待。可是受了资产阶级艺术教育偏见的影响，曲解形象的完整性，颠倒了艺术创造的要求，以为越是接近自然形态的造形就越是完整的造形。在这种偏见的影响之下，民族艺术传统虚无主义的谬论就有了市场，即使是深刻表现了时代精神和新人物精神的群众创作，往往被当成“不像样”的东西来对待。口头说好，在心眼里不见得真正喜爱。正因为这样，革命的浪漫主义和革命的现实主义的结合，在造形艺术上也就成了不好了解的问题。正因为这样，庸俗地对待现实、歪曲现实的自然主义，有时也能够披着现实主义的外衣，欺骗天真的观者。值得考虑的是：应该是敢于幻想，敢于虚构，不受上述偏见影响的漫画家，为什么在改画农民创作时出了偏差，可见上述偏见影响之深远。
    改画农民的作品，似乎较之农民原来进行创作还困难些。其重要原因，不只在于漫画家还没有充分认识农民创作的好处，也在于漫画家还缺乏农民在创作准备中的优越条件。缺乏美术创作经验的农民，当他们进行创作的时候，为什么那样自由？因为他们亲自参加了征服自然的斗争，真正尝到了劳动的甘苦。不论是积肥、烧肥、沤肥，不论是修渠、打井、引水上山，他们经历过许多波折，所以丰产所引起的喜悦就特别深，未来的远景就看得特别透。一句话：农民是以他们的深切的感受为创造的源泉，他们要加以“修改”的对象，不是别人的作品而是自己来自生活的深切的感受。农民的创作也许只表现了他们在生活中得来的感受的千万分之一。喜爱农民创作的漫画家，虽然拥有较高的技术修养，而且改作时确实有了新的成就（例如“大豆过江”等作品对人物精神状态的刻画），可是他们创造的源泉几乎就只靠农民的原作，缺乏相应的材料可以补充和调换，加上还有所谓完整性之类的成见在起作用，所以往往只能把成品打扮得好看一些，弄得不好的，反而把成品搞糟了。如果可以说农民的创造设想是种子，漫画家的加工是阳光，是水分，是肥料，那么，这一切也像农民之得到创造的设想那样，只能依靠相应的生活实践。可见，参加劳动锻炼，对于艺术家说来，不只是为了思想的改造，同时也就是为了艺术思想的改造，是为了艺术创作质量的提高。单说对于所谓完整性的成见的改变，也需要向农民学习；学习他们怎样从现实生活中获得创作的灵感，学习他们怎样全神贯注地对待他们认为重要的东西。在劳动中有了农民一样深切的劳动的喜悦体会，不但画起来就不会这样吃力，而且可能产生高于业余创作的水平的好作品。革命的浪漫主义不是一种没有生活根据的大言壮语，把南瓜或白薯画得很大不就是浪漫主义；浪漫主义只能从革命者深耕了的土壤里长出来。农民的歌颂漫画，显然不是像素描那样，可以靠用功能够学到手的一种技巧，而是从生活实践中培养出来的一种“本能”。不论是为了和农民合作，不论是为了提高自己的创作质量，只能从产生作品的现实下功夫，更方便的道路是难找的。
