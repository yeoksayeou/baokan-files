Dedicated Line Transportation is a Good Method
The Suixi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　Red Flags Fly High on the Suifu Road, Dedicated Line Transportation Achieves Great Success
　　Pedestrians and Vehicles Travel Separately, Traffic Flows Swiftly Like the Wind

　　On the Suifu Highway, it is no longer "a heavy flow of traffic, utterly impassable," but rather vehicles passing unhindered and traffic in good order. The transportation volume is increasing daily, which is the result of implementing dedicated line transportation.

　　The northern and southern mountains of the Lieshan mining area in Suixi County contain large reserves of flint clay, an indispensable refractory material for developing the steel industry. With the rapid development of the steel industry, the mining of refractory materials is also increasing dramatically, with an average monthly output of approximately 200,000 to 300,000 tons. This not only supplies the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, Tongguanshan Mine, and steel plants and mines in Wuhu, Anqing, and other cities and counties, but also sells well in Wuxi, Xuzhou, Shanghai, and other places in Jiangsu Province. Due to the large-scale mining of flint clay, a corresponding large amount of transportation is required. However, the traffic order on this highway was extremely chaotic. On this 23-kilometer highway, there were more than 60 professional trucks, more than 600 small flatbed carts, more than 300 horse-drawn carts, and more than 200 rubber-wheeled handcarts every day, averaging one vehicle every 20-odd meters. Coupled with the large number of pedestrians in the mining area and along the route, this section of the highway became "a heavy flow of traffic, utterly impassable." Sometimes, small flatbed carts and horse-drawn carts formed a line stretching over ten kilometers from head to tail. Due to the extreme congestion of vehicles and pedestrians, although more could be loaded, they could not travel quickly. Truck drivers reflected that this highway had "four many" and "two fears." Four many—many vehicles, many pedestrians, many disputes, and many accidents. Two fears—fear of accidents and fear of not completing the task. For the sake of transportation safety, various vehicles had to reduce their speed. It took an average of one hour and forty minutes for a truck to complete the 23-kilometer distance, and at most, they could only make four round trips a day, and generally three. According to statistics, before mid-September, the daily required output was 3,000 tons, while the actual daily output was only about 400 tons, with a shortfall of 2,600 tons. Therefore, how to ensure the timely transportation of flint clay to meet the needs of the steel industry was an urgent problem to be solved. Faced with such a situation, some people became pessimistic, believing that "the problem of highway congestion cannot be solved, so let's transport it slowly, as much as we can."

　　On September 21, according to the instructions of the Bengbu Prefectural Committee, the county party committee, under the personal leadership of Comrade Xu Caiwen, the first secretary of the county party committee, convened a meeting of party committee secretaries from various districts and townships, as well as responsible persons from institutions, schools, factories, mines, enterprises, and other departments. The meeting first criticized pessimistic views. After carefully analyzing the transportation situation on the Suifu Highway, it was decided to implement dedicated line transportation, with the route from Lieshan via Suixi, bypassing Sipu to Su County, designated as the transportation line for non-motorized vehicles, and the section from Lieshan to Fuliji as the dedicated line for motorized vehicles. The sidewalk outside the trees along the Lieshan-Fuliji Highway was designated as a pedestrian walkway, and all intersections along the route were designated as pedestrian crossings.

　　The implementation of dedicated line transportation was not smooth sailing. In the beginning, some people believed that dedicated line transportation was impossible, saying, "The highway is for people to walk on. Now, only allowing cars and not people or other vehicles is simply not feasible." Some nearby farmers also said, "We built the road. Why only allow cars and not our ox carts, horse-drawn carts, flatbed carts, and handcarts? It's too unreasonable." Some units also emphasized the importance of their transportation and refused to obey the traffic police, insisting on traveling on the highway. Therefore, in the process of implementing dedicated line transportation, we first implemented political command. On the one hand, Li Youfa, the secretary of the county party committee secretariat, and Liu Yutang, a member of the county party committee, were assigned to oversee and direct the operation, and Zhu Jie, the deputy director of the county public security bureau, was transferred to lead the traffic police and volunteer traffic police to maintain traffic order. On the other hand, we conducted in-depth and meticulous publicity and education to the broad masses of people, so that they could understand the great significance of improving transportation and the important role of implementing dedicated line transportation. We also mobilized cadres and the masses to adopt the method of "masses educating masses," launching a large-scale airing of views, big debates on topics such as "Why is it necessary to implement dedicated line transportation? What are the benefits of implementing dedicated line transportation?" After a series of political and ideological education efforts, the awareness of the broad masses of cadres and people was raised. They consciously abided by traffic rules and supervised each other, resulting in an orderly transportation line.

　　Secondly, in the implementation of dedicated line transportation, we fully mobilized and relied on the masses, and vigorously implemented the policy of the whole party and the whole people running transportation. Because the implementation of dedicated line transportation required widening the original highway surface and opening up new pedestrian sidewalks and new transportation lines, it was impossible to do so relying solely on the transportation department. It was necessary to mobilize the broad masses of people to carry out this work. As soon as the county party committee's instructions were issued, more than 8,000 laborers were immediately mobilized. They worked hard day and night, and in addition to widening the original highway by one time, they also built a 6-meter-wide sidewalk outside the trees, with a total length of 19,000 meters. More than 600 people were mobilized to rush-build four branch lines from the highway to the Woniushan, Qinglongshan, and Xiaohuashan mining areas, with a total length of 4,490 meters, in two days. The county transportation department organized more than 70 people into a mass road maintenance team, responsible for maintenance work. The public security department organized more than 50 militiamen and police officers to form a disciplinary team, setting up a traffic volunteer sentry post on average every li (half-kilometer) and at key traffic intersections to maintain traffic order and ensure traffic safety.

　　Although the speed of vehicles increased after the implementation of dedicated line transportation, it was still impossible to achieve the goal of quick loading and quick transport without solving some specific problems. Therefore, while implementing dedicated line transportation, we also added many new institutions to serve dedicated line transportation. For example, the oil depot, maintenance team, and dispatching office were all moved to the construction site. Frontline canteens were established on the construction site, and temporary sheds were built to solve the food and lodging problems of transportation workers. Truck drivers went to the construction site canteen to eat during the gaps in loading materials. Small food stalls were also set up specifically for truck drivers at the loading sites, with various kinds of food and dishes available. As soon as the truck driver showed their license plate, steamed buns, rice, and dishes would be delivered immediately. In the past, it took more than an hour to go back to the station for a meal, but now they could finish their meal during the loading time. The commercial department also organized mobile supply teams to directly supply them with what they needed next to the trucks. Grass and forage supply stations were set up along the road, so that the livestock participating in transportation could "dine" en route. Medical institutions were also set up on the transportation line, so that they could be treated anytime and anywhere. In addition, the handover procedures for double-shift vehicles were also adjusted, and the handover time and location were uniformly stipulated, changing the past situation of disunity and mutual searching, which delayed transportation time.

　　With the realization of dedicated line transportation, transportation efficiency was greatly improved, which required a corresponding solution to the loading and unloading problem. To this end, we also transferred more than 200 strong workers to form a professional loading team to enhance loading capacity. The loading site in the mining area was changed from a single line to a network-ring multi-position loading site, so that vehicles entering and exiting did not need to turn around, and would not be crowded or waiting, greatly improving loading efficiency. The average time to load a vehicle (referring to an 8-ton vehicle) was reduced from the past fastest 30 minutes to 15 to 10 minutes.

　　We have achieved significant results in implementing dedicated line transportation. First, the average number of trips per day for trucks increased from three in the past to eight, and the daily mileage increased from 162 kilometers in the past to 432 kilometers. The most efficient round trip even reached twelve times, with a daily mileage of 688 kilometers. The transport volume has also increased significantly. The average daily output of flint clay by trucks alone reached more than 2,500 tons, with a maximum of 3,000 tons, an increase of five and a half times compared with the average daily output before the implementation of dedicated line transportation. Flatbed carts, horse-drawn carts, ox carts, and other folk transport tools have also greatly improved their transportation efficiency since the implementation of dedicated line transportation. Although the route from Lieshan via Suixi, bypassing Sipu to Su County is 9 kilometers longer than the single journey from Lieshan to Su County, the daily transport volume has also increased from less than 100 tons on average in the past to more than 200 tons, more than doubling the transportation efficiency, due to the reduced vehicle density, increased spacing, and elimination of congestion and mutual vehicle-passing time.

　　Secondly, the implementation of dedicated line transportation has made transportation and loading and unloading coordinated. Before this, due to highway congestion, blockages, and other conditions, it was difficult for trucks to arrive on time, so waiting for loading and unloading often occurred, resulting in wasted transport capacity. On the loading and unloading side, the loading and unloading was sometimes loose and sometimes tight, affecting transportation, due to the fact that the trucks could not arrive on time and sometimes arrived too many and sometimes too few. Now, due to the implementation of dedicated line transportation, trucks have basically achieved on-time arrival (it takes about 90 minutes for a round trip from Lieshan to Fuliji), so that the loading and unloading department can arrange labor according to the number of vehicles, achieving planned loading and unloading.

　　Again, the implementation of dedicated line transportation enables the maintenance of vehicles to be arranged in a unified manner. Preventative inspections, minor repairs, and maintenance can be carried out in a timely manner using the loading and unloading time, thereby greatly reducing the number of times that vehicles are sent to the factory for repair due to minor problems.

　　In short, dedicated line transportation has many advantages. At present, the whole party and the whole people are vigorously running the iron and steel industry, and the transportation of materials in many key mines and cities is frequent, and the traffic lines are extremely congested. If dedicated line transportation is promoted in these places, it will have an immediate and multiplier effect on eliminating vehicle congestion and improving transportation efficiency.

    专线运输是个好办法
    中共濉溪县委员会
    濉符路上帅旗红　专线运输奏奇功
    行人车辆分道走　车水马龙快如风
    在濉符公路上，再也不是“车水马龙，水泄不通”，而是车辆通行无阻，交通秩序井然了，运输量正在与日俱增，这是实行专线运输的结果。
    濉溪县烈山矿区的北山和南山，蕴藏着大量的焦宝石。这是发展钢铁工业不可缺少的耐火材料。随着钢铁工业的迅速发展，耐火材料的开采量，也在急剧增长，月产量平均在二十万吨至三十万吨左右，它不仅供应马鞍山钢铁公司、铜官山矿以及芜湖、安庆等市、县钢铁厂矿，同时还畅销到江苏省的无锡、徐州和上海等地。由于大量的开采焦宝石，相应而来的便是大量的运输，然而这条公路交通秩序极为紊乱，在这条全长二十三公里的公路上，每天都有专业汽车六十余辆，小板车六百多辆，马车三百多辆，胶轮手推车二百多辆，平均每二十多公尺就有一辆车子，加上矿区和沿线的行人众多，因而这段公路就出现了“车水马龙，水泄不通”的现象。有时小板车和马车连成一线，头尾长达十余公里。由于车辆行人异常拥挤，虽能多装，但不能快跑。汽车司机反映这条公路上有
  “四多”，“二怕”。四多——车子多、行人多、争执多、事故多。二怕——怕出事故、怕完不成任务。为着运输的安全，各种车辆不得不减低速度，汽车跑完二十三公里的远距，平均需要一点四十分钟，每天最多的也只能往返运行四趟，一般的是三趟。据统计，9月中旬以前，每日的要求运出量均在三千吨，而每日实际运出量仅达四百吨左右，相比之下，尚有两千六百吨不能运出。因此，如何保证及时地运出焦宝石，满足钢铁工业的需要，是一个迫切需要解决的问题。面临着这样一个局面，有些人就消极悲观了，他们认为“公路车辆拥挤问题无法解决，还是慢慢地运吧，能运多少算多少”。
    9月21日，县委根据蚌埠地委的指示，由县委第一书记许彩文同志，亲自主持召开各区、乡党委书记及机关、学校、厂矿、企业等部门负责人会议，会议首先批判了悲观论调，在认真分析了濉符公路的运输情况后，决定实行专线运输，由烈山经濉溪绕道四铺至宿县，作为非机动车的运输线，由烈山至符离集段，作为机动车的专用线，烈山至符离集公路行道的树外副道，作为人行道，沿路的交叉道均划定为人行道。
    实行专线运输并不是一帆风顺的，在开始时，有些人认为专线运输不可能实现，他们说：“公路就是留人走的，现在光叫跑汽车，不叫人走，也不叫其它车辆走，那根本不行”；附近有些农民也说：“路是我们修的，为什么光叫汽车走，不叫我们的牛车、马车、平车、手推车走？太不合理了”；也有些单位，强调自己运输重要，不听从交通警的指挥，强行走在公路上。因此，我们在实行专线运输过程中，首先实行政治挂帅，一方面派县委书记处书记李友法、县委委员刘玉堂两同志坐镇指挥，并抽调县公安局的副局长朱杰同志，领导交通警和义务交通警，维持交通秩序；另一方面，向广大群众进行深入、细致的宣传教育，使他们了解搞好交通运输的重大意义和实行专线运输的重要作用，并发动干部和群众，采取以群众教育群众的方法，以“为什么要实行专线运输？实行专线运输有哪些好处？”等为题，开展大鸣大放大辩论。经过一系列的政治思想教育工作以后，广大干部和群众，认识提高了，自觉遵守公路秩序，并相互监督，从而运输线上井然有序。
    其次，我们在实行专线运输中，充分发动群众，依靠群众，大力贯彻了全党全民办交通的方针。因为实行专线运输，要拓宽原有公路面，开辟新的人行副道和新的运输线，单靠运输部门是办不到的，必须发动广大群众来进行这一工作。当县委的指示刚一发出后，就立即出动八千多名民工，他们苦战一昼夜，除把原公路修宽一倍外，又修成树外人行道一条六公尺宽的路面，总长一万九千公尺，并发动六百余人，突击两天修成从公路通往卧牛山、青龙山、小花山矿区的四条支线，总长四千四百九十公尺。县交通科组织群众养路队七十多人，负责保养工作，公安部门组织民兵、民警五十余人组成纠察队，在平均一华里的路上和交通要道口上，设立了一个交通义务岗哨，维持交通秩序，保证行车安全。
    实行专线运输后，车速虽然提高了，可是对一些具体问题不解决，仍不能达到快装快跑的目的。因此，我们在实行专线运输的同时，又增设许多新的机构，为专线运输服务。例如把油料库、保养组、调度室全搬到工地，又在工地上建立前线食堂，搭临时工棚，解决运输工人食宿问题，汽车司机在装料的空隙内，就到工地食堂去吃饭，装料场上还专门为汽车司机设立了小吃铺，铺内备有各种饭、菜等，只要汽车司机把开车牌照一拿，馒头、饭、菜随后就到。过去回到站内吃顿饭要花去一个多钟头的时间，现在趁车子装料时间，就可把饭吃好；商业部门还组织了流动供应组直接到汽车旁供给他们所需要的东西；在路旁设立草料供应站，使参加运输的牲口可在途中“用餐”，医疗机构也都设在运输线上，随时随地都可以治疗。此外，双班车辆的交班手续，也作了调整，统一规定了交班时间和交班地点，改变过去不统一，相互寻找而拖延运输时间的状况。
    随着专线运输的实现，运输效率大大提高了，这就要相应地解决装卸问题。为此，我们又抽调二百余名身强力壮的工人，组成专业装车队，增强装料能力。并将矿区装料厂由单线改为网环形多位装料厂，进出车辆不需调头，不致拥挤等候，使装车效率大为提高。平均每装一部车，从过去最快的三十分钟（指八吨车皮）降为十五分到十分钟。
    我们实行专线运输，已收到了显著效果。首先是汽车每昼夜平均运次，由过去的三趟增至八趟，日行程从过去的一百六十二公里，增至四百三十二公里，效率最高的往返竟达十二次，日行程六百八十八公里。在运量上也大大增加，平均每天运出的焦宝石，仅汽车运量即达两千五百多吨，最高达到三千吨，比实行专线运输前平均日运量提高五倍半。平板车、马车、牛车等民间运输工具，自实行专线运输以后，运输效率也提高很多，虽然由烈山经濉溪绕道四铺至宿县，较烈山到宿县单程多行九公里，由于车辆密度降低，拉开了距离，消除拥挤及相互让车的时间，因而日运量也由过去平均不足一百吨增加到二百多吨，提高运输效率一倍以上。
    其次，实行专线运输后，使运输与装卸协调一致。在此以前，汽车由于公路拥挤、堵塞和其它条件的限制，就很难做到定时到达，因此经常发生等装待卸，造成运力浪费；装卸方面，也由于汽车不能按时到达和到时忽多忽少，而形成装卸时松时紧，影响运输。现在，由于专线运输的实行，汽车已基本上做到按时到达，（烈山至符离集往返一次约需九十分钟），从而使装卸部门能按车辆多寡安排劳力，达到有计划的装卸。
    再次，由于专线运输的推行，保修车辆亦能做到统筹安排。可利用装卸时间及时地进行预防性的检查小修与保养，从而大大减少了因小毛病而进厂待修的次数。
    总之，专线运输具有很多优点，当前全党全民大办钢铁工业，许多重点矿山、城市物资运输频繁，交通线上车辆拥挤不堪，如果在这些地方推广专线运输，这对消除车辆拥挤现象、提高运输效率，则可收到立竿见影、事半功倍之效。
