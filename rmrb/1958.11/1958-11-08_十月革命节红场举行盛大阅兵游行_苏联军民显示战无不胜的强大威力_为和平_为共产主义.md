Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 7th: A grand military parade and mass procession were held today in Moscow's Red Square to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution.

From early morning, people attending the holiday ceremony arrived at the viewing stands in Red Square. On the viewing stand outside the Kremlin wall were the heads of various departments of the Soviet government, veteran Communist Party members, representatives from all walks of life in Moscow, and delegations from many countries. Diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries stationed in the Soviet Union also attended.

When Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Voroshilov, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Mikoyan, Suslov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, and others, as well as the delegation of the Polish People's Republic headed by Gomulka, ascended to the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum, enthusiastic applause resounded in Red Square.

The parade began at ten o'clock in the morning.

Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky, accompanied by Parade Commander Marshal Moskalenko, inspected the troops lined up in Red Square and nearby streets. After congratulating the officers and soldiers on the holiday, Marshal Malinovsky ascended the mausoleum reviewing platform and delivered a speech to the troops, guests, and all Soviet working people.

Marshal Malinovsky said that the Soviet people are greeting the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution with new construction achievements. He said that the Soviet people are full of confidence in realizing a new and tremendous upsurge in economic and cultural development, so as to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output in the shortest historical period.

Marshal Malinovsky pointed out that the people of all socialist countries are advancing along the road to a bright future together with the Soviet people. Common goals, the upsurge of economic and political strength, fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance, and the close-knit friendship between the armies of all socialist countries make the socialist camp an invincible force.

Malinovsky then pointed out that the Soviet Union is unremittingly struggling to defend lasting world peace. However, the efforts made by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to consolidate peace have been stubbornly opposed by the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and other imperialist countries.

Malinovsky said: "In the face of the imperialists' blatant military adventures and provocations, the Soviet Union is taking all measures to further strengthen the Soviet Union's defense capabilities, equip the army, navy, and air force with first-class modern technology and weapons, and improve the vigilance and combat readiness of the armed forces." He emphasized that if the aggressors dare to launch a new world war, the Soviet armed forces have all the necessary conditions to give them a devastating rebuff.

Then, the parade formation began.

According to tradition, the flowers and pride of the Soviet armed forces—the students of various military academies—were the first to be reviewed. Following them into the square were the navy, border guards, and students of the Suvorov Military School and the Nakhimov Naval School.

The troops of the Taman Guards Division, which had achieved outstanding results in the Great Patriotic War, passed the reviewing stand in armored vehicles. Following them were the air force marines sitting on small tanks and the mechanized anti-aircraft artillery of the Kantemirovsk Division. The famous "Katyusha"—various wheeled and tracked rocket launchers—rumbled across Red Square, their firepower, accuracy, range, and projectile impact area having been incomparably strengthened compared to the original types.

At the end of the parade were troops equipped with various heavy and light artillery, large-caliber anti-aircraft artillery, and long-range heavy artillery. From their lineup and equipment, people can see the power of the invincible Soviet army.

After the parade, according to tradition, a column of motorcycle teams entered Red Square, announcing the start of the holiday procession with the sound of horns.

A sports team walked into the square, carrying the national flags of the socialist camp countries. Subsequently, athletes, aviation model makers, glider pilots, and parachutists walked to the side of the mausoleum, raised their hands, and released colorful stars and glider models. A silver-white rocket flew into the sky.

A sea of red banners fluttered in the square. Teams of workers and peasants began to enter the square. The various models, charts, and placards held high by the teams told people what significant achievements the Soviet people had made on the road to building communism.

People applauded enthusiastically to welcome the team of scientists. They held up models of Soviet artificial Earth satellites, whose signal sounds merged with the joyful sounds of the festival. Models of the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker "Lenin," models of the second Soviet nuclear power station with a power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts, and many beautiful propaganda paintings also reflected the achievements of the selfless labor of 250,000 Soviet scientists.

A wave of singing and laughter flew across Red Square as the students' teams walked over. The youths warmly paid tribute to the leaders of the Party and the government and to the distinguished guests from the fraternal country of Poland.

"For peace!" "Give peace to the world!"—These words from the hearts of the Soviet people constantly appeared on tens of thousands of flags, placards, and banners. The Soviet people used their actions to show that they wholeheartedly support the Soviet Union's peace policy and support the Soviet Union's struggle for a permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing and for world peace.

Slogans congratulating the people of socialist countries and the people of all countries striving for peace and democracy constantly resounded in Red Square.

The parade lasted for more than two hours.

Hundreds of thousands of working people participated in this parade. This parade reflected the unbreakable unity and solidarity of the Communist Party and the Soviet people.

Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on November 7th: Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky said in an order celebrating the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution that the Soviet Union, while dedicating itself to the great cause of building communism, resolutely and consistently struggles for peace and international security. In this regard, the Soviet Union has received the support of all peace-loving forces.

The order said that in the face of the rampant and dangerous activities of the enemies of peace, the Soviet people are taking all necessary measures to further strengthen national defense.

Malinovsky said: "The officers and soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy should continue to improve their political awareness, moral character, and combat skills in the future, unremittingly master new weapons and military technology, consolidate discipline and organization, and strengthen revolutionary vigilance and combat readiness."

    十月革命节红场举行盛大阅兵游行
    苏联军民显示战无不胜的强大威力
    为和平  为共产主义
    新华社莫斯科7日电　在节日的莫斯科红场上，今天举行了盛大的阅兵式和群众游行，庆祝十月革命四十一周年。
    从早晨起，参加节日观礼的人们就陆续来到红场的观礼台上。在克里姆林宫墙外的观礼台上观礼的有苏联政府各部门负责人、老共产党员、莫斯科各界的代表和许多国家的代表团。前来观礼的还有各国驻苏联的外交使节和武官。
    当苏联共产党和政府的领导人伏罗希洛夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫、米高扬、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫等人以及以哥穆尔卡为首的波兰人民共和国代表团走上列宁—斯大林陵墓时，红场上响起了热烈的掌声。
    阅兵在上午十时开始。
    苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅在阅兵指挥官莫斯卡连科元帅陪同下，乘车检阅了排列在红场和红场附近街道上的军队。马利诺夫斯基元帅在向指战员们祝贺节日后，登上了陵墓检阅台，向军队、来宾和苏联全体劳动人民发表了演说。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说，苏联人民用新的建设成就来迎接十月革命四十一周年。他说，苏联人民满怀信心来实现经济文化新的巨大的高涨，以便在最短的历史时期内在按人口计算的产品产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅指出，各社会主义国家人民同苏联人民一道沿着通向光辉未来的道路前进。共同的目标，经济力量和政治力量的高涨、兄弟合作和互助、各社会主义国家的军队的亲如一家的友谊，使社会主义阵营成为不可战胜的力量。
    马利诺夫斯基接着指出，苏联坚持不懈地为保卫持久的世界和平而斗争。但是，苏联和人民民主国家为巩固和平而作的努力遭到美国、英国和其他帝国主义国家统治集团的顽固的反对。
    马利诺夫斯基说：“在帝国主义者公然进行军事冒险和挑衅的情况下，苏联正在采取一切措施来进一步加强苏联的防御力量，用头等的现代化技术装备和武器装备陆海空三军，并且提高武装部队的警惕性和战斗准备。”他强调指出，如果侵略者胆敢发动新的世界大战，苏联武装部队具备一切必要的条件，能够给予他们以毁灭性的回击。
    接着，阅兵分列式开始。
    按照传统，苏联武装部队的花朵和骄傲——各军事学院学员最先接受了检阅。随后进入广场的是海军、边防军和苏沃洛夫军事学校和纳希莫夫军事学校的学生。
    在伟大卫国战争中战绩卓著的塔曼近卫师的部队坐着装甲车通过检阅台。随后而来的是坐在小坦克车上的空军陆战队和康捷米罗夫斯克师的机械化高射炮部队。著名的“喀秋沙”——各种轮式和履带式火箭炮从红场上隆隆滚过，它们的火力、准确性、射程和被弹面同最初的类型相比已经无比地加强了。
    走在分列式最后面的是配备有各种重炮和轻炮的部队、大口径的高射炮部队和远程重炮兵。从他们的阵容和装备中，人们可以看出战无不胜的苏联军队的威力。
    阅兵结束后，按照传统，一列机器脚踏车队伍进入红场，用号角声宣告节日游行开始。
    体育大队走进了广场，他们打着社会主义阵营各国的国旗。随后，运动员、航空模型制造者、滑翔机驾驶员和跳伞运动员走到了陵墓旁边，举起手放出五色缤纷的星星和滑翔机模型。一支银白色的火箭飞上了天空。
    广场上飘扬起一片红色横幅旗帜。工人和农民的队伍开始走进广场。队伍高举的各种模型、图表和标语牌告诉人们：苏联人民在建设共产主义的道路上获得了何等重大的成就。
    人们热烈鼓掌欢迎科学家的队伍。他们高举着苏联人造地球卫星的模型，它发出的讯号声跟节日的欢乐声汇成一片。世界上第一艘原子破冰船“列宁号”的模型、发电能力为十万瓩的第二座苏联原子能电站的模型和许许多多美丽的宣传画，也反映了苏联二十五万科学家忘我劳动的成就。
    红场上飞扬起一片歌声和欢笑声，这是学生们的队伍走过来了。青年们热烈向党和政府的领导人、向来自兄弟之邦波兰的贵宾们热情致敬。
    “为了和平！”、“给世界和平！”——成千上万的旗帜、标语牌和横幅上不断出现这些出自苏联人内心的话。苏联人民用自己的行动表明，他们一心拥护苏联的和平政策，支持苏联为永久停止核武器试验、为世界和平而进行的斗争。
    红场上不断响起向社会主义国家的人民、向争取和平和民主的各国人民祝贺的口号。
    游行进行了两小时以上。
    有数以十万计的劳动人民参加了这次游行。这次游行反映了共产党和苏联人民牢不可破的团结和一致。
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅在庆祝十月革命四十一周年的命令中说，苏联在致力于建设共产主义伟大事业的同时，坚决一贯地为和平和国际安全而斗争。在这方面苏联得到了所有爱好和平的力量的支持。
    命令说，在和平的敌人猖獗地进行危险活动的情况下，苏联人民采取一切必要的措施来进一步加强国防。
    马利诺夫斯基说：苏联“陆军和海军的官兵今后应继续提高自己的政治觉悟、道德品质和战斗素养，坚持不懈地掌握新武器和军事技术，巩固纪律性和组织性，加强革命警惕性和战斗准备”。（附图片）
