Eliminate Pests in Winter
    Shaanxi Launches Large-Scale Pest Control Campaign

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Shaanxi Province farmers are seizing the current favorable opportunity to start early and launch a campaign to eliminate various plant diseases and insect pests.

    The present time is the golden period for preventing and controlling crop diseases and insect pests. According to the experience of Shaanxi in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests over the years, the present is the time when various insect pests gather in residual branches, dead leaves, soil, and wall crevices to hibernate, so it is easy to concentrate and eliminate them. Eliminating one now is equivalent to eliminating hundreds or even tens of thousands of pests during the pest activity period next year. Party and government leading departments at all levels attach great importance to this work. Secretaries take the lead and send many cadres deep into the countryside. Based on the different situations of disease and insect pests in various places, they mobilize the masses to combine with the current agricultural activities and carry out large-scale pest control work. In northern Shaanxi, the masses have been carrying out the work of clearing fields since the first half of October to eliminate pathogens overwintering on the ground. At present, they are continuing to combine autumn plowing with the movement to dig up stubble, planning to expose "cutworms," "noctuid moths," and other pests that burrowed into the soil before the autumn harvest on the ground, so that birds can eat them or they will freeze to death. In the Guanzhong area, the main wheat-producing area, farmers in 44 counties and cities have not only treated more than 12 million mu of wheat fields with seed dressing and soil disinfection to eliminate underground pests, but also generally sprayed the walls of cotton warehouses where cotton is stored with pesticides and pasted paper strips; small ditches were dug around the drying yards to prevent pink bollworms from escaping. The people's communes in Gaoling County have already killed more than 21,000 jin of pink bollworms, which is more than ten times that of last year. There are a total of 1.9 million mu of paddy fields in the Hanzhong area. In order to eliminate rice borers, the farmers in the entire area processed 80% of the rice stubble within 20 days.

    Masses in various places are collecting and manufacturing a large amount of indigenous pesticides for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests next year. Many people's communes in Ankang and Hanzhong areas in southern Shaanxi have sent many experienced commune members to find raw materials that can be used to make indigenous pesticides. Baoji County has already held an on-site meeting on the manufacture of indigenous pesticides, and handed over 105 kinds of indigenous pesticide samples that have been successfully trial-produced to various people's communes for manufacture. Chang'an and Dali counties have successfully trial-produced more than 140 kinds of indigenous pesticides.

    In order to improve pest control efficiency and solve the problem of insufficient tools, the masses in various places have also come up with many methods. In Xianyang County, the masses used wooden boards to nail together bellows-style powder sprayers because there were not enough powder sprayers in pest control. One person hangs it around their neck and can spray 40 mu of land every day. In the large-scale autumn and winter pest control campaign, various places have also paid attention to training pest control personnel for the people's communes. This winter, the province plans to train a total of 100,000 pest control personnel for the people's communes, to impart pest control technology to the masses and overcome the difficulty of insufficient technical force in carrying out large-scale pest control.

    Shaanxi Province has a great momentum in eliminating crop diseases and insect pests. In order to start early and eliminate various diseases and insect pests next year, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has held on-site meetings on the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests in Zhouzhi and Hu County respectively. It has repeatedly requested all localities to act quickly, closely integrate with the current agricultural activities, and carry out a large-scale pest control campaign, and strive to eliminate the diseases and insect pests of major crops in the province before sowing next year. The four joint prevention areas for diseases and insect pests organized by 14 counties in the Hanzhong area, three have already held joint prevention meetings, and mutually checked the preparation of pest control medicines and equipment, the collection of indigenous pesticides, and the mobilization of the masses. Many counties have also mobilized the masses to debate the significance of starting early to prevent and control diseases and insect pests for winning a greater harvest next year. In the past, some of the masses in Xiwu Township, Xingping County, did not pay enough attention to carrying out autumn and winter pest control work. After the debate, 20,000 people have been mobilized to form a large pest control army. (Liu Bin)

### 把害虫消灭在冬季  陕西开展大规模消灭病虫害运动

    把害虫消灭在冬季
    陕西开展大规模消灭病虫害运动
    本报讯　陕西省农民正在抓紧当前的有利时机，提早动手开展消灭各种病虫害运动。
    当前正是防治农作物病虫害的黄金时期。根据陕西历年防治病虫害的经验证明，目前正是各种虫害向残枝败叶和土中、墙缝内集结休眠的时候，因此容易集中消灭。现在消灭一个即等于在明年虫害活动时期消灭几百条，甚至几万条害虫。各地党、政领导部门都很重视这个工作，由书记挂帅，派许多干部深入农村，根据各地发生病虫害的不同情况，发动群众结合当前的农事活动，开展大规模的防虫工作。陕北地区群众从10月上半月开展了清除田园的工作，消灭地面上病虫越冬的病菌；目前正在继续结合秋翻地，开展挖谷槎运动，计划把在秋收前钻入土中的“地老虎”、“夜盗虫”等翻露在地面上，让鸟儿吃掉或冻死。关中主要产麦区四十四县市的农民，除已经给一千二百多万亩麦田进行药剂拌种和土壤消毒，消灭地下害虫外，一般都给储存的棉花仓库内的墙上喷了药，糊了纸条；晒花场周围挖了小沟，阻止红铃虫逃窜。高陵县的人民公社已经杀死二万一千多斤红铃虫，这比去年大十倍以上。汉中专区共有稻田一百九十万亩，为了消灭稻螟虫，全区农民在二十天时间内，就处理了80％的稻槎。
    各地群众为明年防治病虫害采集和制造大量的土农药。陕南安康和汉中专区不少人民公社已经派出许多有经验的社员寻找能泡制土农药的原料。宝鸡县已经召开了制造土药的现场会议，把已经试制成功的一百零五种土农药样品，交给各人民公社进行制造。长安和大荔县已经试制成功一百四十多种土农药。
    为了提高防虫效率，解决工具不足的问题，各地群众也想了很多办法。咸阳县的群众在防治虫害中，因为喷粉器不足，当地农民即用木板钉成风箱式的喷粉器，一个人挂在脖子上，每天可喷四十亩地。各地在开展大规模的秋冬防虫运动中，还注意了训练人民公社的防虫人员。全省在今冬共计划训练十万名人民公社的防虫员，把防虫技术交给群众，克服在开展大面积防虫害中技术力量不足的困难。
    陕西省各地对消灭农作物病虫害的劲头很大。为了提早动手消灭明年的各种病虫害，陕西省农林厅已经分别在盩厔、鄠县召开了防治病虫害现场会议。反复要求各地迅速行动起来，密切结合当前的农事活动，开展大规模的防虫运动，争取把全省主要农作物的病虫害消灭在明年播种以前。汉中专区十四县组织的四个病虫害联防区，有三个已经召开了联防会议，互相检查关于防虫药械准备、采集土农药和发动群众的情况。许多县并发动群众鸣放辩论了提早动手防治病虫害对争取明年获得更大丰收的意义。兴平县西午乡有些群众过去对开展秋冬防虫工作不够重视，经过争辩，已经发动两万人，组成一个防虫大军。　（刘斌）
