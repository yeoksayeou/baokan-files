    Xiangtan Special District Emphasizes Protecting Cattle Through the Winter
    Open Grazing and Unsheltered Sleeping Largely Eliminated

    (Our report) The Xiangtan Special District of Hunan Province has adopted specific measures to protect cattle through the winter, based on the new circumstances after communization. The Xiangtan Special District has consistently done well in cattle care, and the current deep plowing tasks for both paddy and dry fields in the region are mainly completed with cattle power. After communization, most people's communes established feeding farms by production team units, selecting areas with better grazing conditions and convenient cultivation. This requires establishing specialized teams for management and paying attention to disease prevention. However, some people's communes have not paid enough attention to this work, and there are still many problems with livestock overwintering. The Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently requested, in two telephone conferences, that all county committees and people's commune party committees conduct a check and comparison of cattle protection work, ensuring: (1) cattle sheds have wind and cold protection facilities; (2) sufficient feed is stored; (3) a "six-fix" system is established, with fixed personnel, fixed cattle, fixed time, fixed feed, fixed condition, and fixed rewards, and specialized personnel are assigned to prevent and control diseases, ensuring the safe overwintering of cattle. Currently, all 184 commune party committees in the district have combined this with central work and universally carried out education on protecting cattle through the winter among commune members. At the same time, each commune has successively established cattle protection and breeding committees and strengthened specialized teams in livestock farms, selecting politically reliable people with rich feeding experience as feeders. To ensure that each cow grows plump and strong, all people's communes in the district have fixed full-time veterinarians who are required to inspect all cattle two or three times a month. Many places have established cattle epidemic prevention stations at the commune level.

    People's communes in various places have repaired deficient and dilapidated cattle sheds and pens, basically eliminating the phenomenon of open grazing and unsheltered sleeping. Many cattle-raising teams have also prepared fuels such as coarse bran and tree roots to provide warmth for cattle in cold weather. The district's more than 400,000 cattle generally have 4,000 to 5,000 catties of feed stored per head, including rice straw, sweet potato vines, cottonseed cake, shriveled grain, and salt. In the past, health-boosting medicine was given to cattle only in December, but now cattle are being fed earlier. As a result, the percentage of poorly raised cattle has quickly decreased from 15%-20% to around 5%. (Hao Bangzhu et al.)

    湘潭专区重视耕牛过冬
    敞放露宿现象基本改变
    本报讯　湖南省湘潭专区根据公社化后的新情况，已采取具体措施保护耕牛过冬。湘潭专区各地对耕牛养护工作一直做得很好，当前全区的水田和旱田深耕任务，主要就是靠牛力完成的。在公社化以后，大部分人民公社都以生产队为单位，选择放牧条件较好、耕作方便的地区建立饲养场。这样，在管理方面就需要建立专业队和注意防治疫病。但是，这个工作有部分人民公社还注意不够，牲畜过冬问题仍然很多。中共湘潭地委最近在两次电话会议上，要求各县委和人民公社党委将护牛工作进行一次检查评比，做到：（1）牛栏有防风防寒设备；（2）贮备足饲料；（3）建立起定人、定牛、定时、定料、定膘、定奖励的六定制度，设专人防治疫病，确保耕牛安全过冬。现在，全区一百八十四个公社党委结合中心工作，普遍对社员开展了护牛过冬的教育。与此同时，各公社都先后成立了耕牛护养繁殖委员会，并在畜牧场中健全了专业队，选择了政治可靠而又富有饲养经验的人为饲养员。为了使每条牛长得膘肥、体壮，全区各人民公社都固定了专职兽医，规定每月对所有耕牛检查两三次。不少地方以公社为单位建立了耕牛防疫所。
    各地人民公社对缺少和烂了的牛舍牛栏都进行了修理，基本上消灭了敞放、露宿的现象。很多养牛专业队还准备了粗糠、树根等燃料，以便在天寒地冻的日子里，给耕牛烧火取暖。全区四十多万头耕牛，一般每头储备了四、五千斤饲料，其中有稻草、薯藤、棉饼、瘪谷和食盐。过去要在12月才给牛吃保健牛药，现在纷纷提前喂牛。这样一来养得不好的牛，很快由15％—20％降低到5％左右。（郝棒柱等）
