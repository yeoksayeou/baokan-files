(From our newspaper in Changsha, November 8th) In the midst of intense labor and production, Liuyang County, Hunan Province, has paid attention to combining work and rest. Thanks to appropriate rest, the vast majority of commune members are full of energy, labor efficiency has improved, and all production tasks have been completed very well.

Liuyang County realized the people's commune system at the end of September. Immediately following the implementation of organizational militarization and action combatization, living was collectivized. The Liuyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Party committees of various communes generally care about the economic lives of commune members, and the public canteens are generally well-run, which satisfies the commune members. However, due to the urgency of tasks and the shortage of labor, some places did not pay enough attention to the rest of the commune members, and the commune members had very little sleeping time each day. Their physical strength could not keep up, and work efficiency decreased instead.

After the Liuyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this problem, it promptly instructed the Party committees of various communes to ensure that commune members slept for seven or eight hours a day under normal circumstances, had two days off a month, and women could take leave during menstruation. At the same time, they should organize the cultural and recreational life of commune members.

Among the cadres of communes and brigades, there were several different opinions regarding the county committee's instruction: One was to actively support it. They believed that the masses did not care about working hours or remuneration and worked hard day and night. This enthusiasm was very valuable, and in order to protect the enthusiasm of the masses, they must be given appropriate rest time. Another opinion was that now was the time when "one day equals twenty years," and resting for a few hours would take away a lot of effort. How could we talk about rest! Still another opinion was that there was no need to worry about food and clothing now, so there was no need to talk about rest. In response to these ideas, the county committee organized cadres of various communes to conduct free airing of views and debates. The focus of the debate was: Is appropriate rest beneficial or not beneficial to production? Can the task be completed? How should we care for the lives of the masses? Various localities used many specific facts to discuss the issues in a practical way and unified their thinking. Everyone agreed that the enthusiasm of the masses to work hard day and night was valuable, and it was possible to work overtime to complete a certain urgent task, but we could not ignore rest for a long time. The fundamental way to solve the shortage of labor was not to work overtime, but to carry out technological revolution and improve labor management. During the debate, the Rocket Commune reviewed the situation during the early rice harvest and late rice planting. The original Jia Yi Cooperative and Jia Er Cooperative of this commune were connected, and the area of paddy fields that the two cooperatives had to bear was about the same on average. Jia Yi Cooperative worked all night as soon as it started the "double抢," and after two or three days of work, some people could not support their bodies, and the number of people working decreased from 2,900 to 2,100, and work efficiency slowly decreased. Jia Er Cooperative also worked every night when the "double抢" was tense, but only worked until 12 o'clock. They also rested for two hours at noon when the sun was scorching, so the commune members were always full of energy. As a result, although Jia Er Cooperative started the "double抢" two days later than Jia Yi Cooperative, it completed the task four days earlier than Jia Yi Cooperative. Such examples have made everyone further realize that hard work must be combined with appropriate rest, and that labor and leisure are combined to protect the enthusiasm of the masses and further improve labor efficiency.

In order to ensure that the county committee's instructions on caring for the lives of the masses were implemented, the county also held an on-site meeting of welfare ministers of people's communes. The county committee has appointed a deputy secretary to take charge of the lives of the masses, and each commune has a secretary or committee member to take charge of life, and the welfare minister specializes in life.

Now, under normal circumstances, the commune members of this county get up at five o'clock in the morning, followed by an hour of military training; after eating breakfast, they go to work, rest for more than an hour at noon; after eating dinner at six o'clock, they rest for a while, and then go to various spare-time schools to study culture and politics, and sometimes go to the club to read books and play games. Each commune has established a vacation system, with two days off a month, once every half month. On the day of the holiday, the commune kills pigs to improve meals, amateur theater troupes perform plays, film teams show movies, and the club is crowded with people. Young men and women are dressed beautifully, watching plays, dancing; those who like to play ball play ball, those who like to play chess play chess. Everyone enjoys their holidays happily.

Because the Party cares about the lives of the masses and cherishes the masses, and combines labor with rest, the masses are full of energy, more energetic, and have higher labor efficiency. On the second day of the Rocket Commune's holiday, the amount of tea seeds picked by each laborer increased from an average of five loads per day to ten loads, and the number of people working increased from 75% of the total population to 83%. The county's tasks of harvesting late rice and oil tea and planting oil tea have been completed ahead of schedule at the end of October, and the task of deep plowing 480,000 mu of land has also been completed.

(Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 7th) After Huangyuan County, Qinghai Province, ensured that commune members had a certain amount of rest time through a system, labor efficiency has significantly improved.

The eight people's communes in Huangyuan County uniformly stipulated that commune members should rest for one day after working for half a month; after two consecutive night battles, they would not work or hold meetings on the third night; and they strengthened the leadership of canteens and nurseries. This regulation was determined by the county committee's meeting of commune party secretaries at the end of September. At that time, the tasks of harvesting, deep plowing, iron smelting, and water conservancy construction were squeezed together, and the commune members were very enthusiastic, so they worked day and night. Because commune members lacked the necessary rest time, labor efficiency slowly decreased. For example, when the youth combat company of the Feihai Commune first started harvesting, each person could harvest 150 bundles of wheat per day, but after continuous night battles, they could only harvest 80 to 90 bundles per day. Some commune members also had some opinions about not having time to handle housework. After the county committee discovered this situation, it specially convened a meeting of commune party secretaries to determine that commune members should be guaranteed a certain amount of rest time through a system.

Now, all the communes have strictly implemented the regulations, allowing commune members to rest and handle personal matters on time, such as washing clothes and cleaning. The collective canteen has also improved significantly, and generally makes separate meals for the elderly and children. Nurseries will also be changed from day care to full care. Commune members are well rested, eat and drink well, and women do not worry about their children. Everyone is full of energy, and labor morale and efficiency have generally improved. Taking deep plowing as an example, recently four people can do the work of five people at the end of September. Commune members all say that with hard work and rest, everyone is full of energy and can guarantee two days of work in one day.

### 狠狠地生产　好好地休息  浏阳、湟源妥善安排劳逸结合，社员个个精力充沛

    狠狠地生产　好好地休息
    浏阳、湟源妥善安排劳逸结合，社员个个精力充沛
    本报长沙8日电　在紧张的劳动生产中，湖南省浏阳县注意劳逸结合，广大社员由于有适当的休息，个个精力充沛，劳动效率提高，各项生产任务都完成得很好。
    浏阳县9月底实现人民公社化，在紧接着实行组织军事化、行动战斗化的同时，实行了生活集体化。中共浏阳县委和各社党委对社员经济生活一般都很关心，公共食堂一般办得很好，社员都很满意。但由于任务紧，劳力不足，有些地方对社员的休息注意得不够，社员每天睡觉时间很少，体力支持不了，工效反而降低。
    中共浏阳县委发现这个问题以后，便及时指示各公社党委，在一般情况下，要保证社员每天睡足七、八个小时，每月放两天假，妇女在月经期可以请假，同时要组织好社员的文娱生活。
    在公社和大队干部中对待县委的这个指示，曾经有几种不同意见：一种是积极拥护。他们认为群众不计劳动时间，不计报酬，日夜苦干，这种积极性是非常可贵的，为了保护群众的这种积极性，一定要让群众有适当的休息时间。另一种意见则认为现在是“一天等于二十年”，休息几个钟头就要去掉很多工夫，那里还谈得上休息！再一种意见是认为现在吃穿不用愁，不该谈休息了。针对这些思想，县委组织各公社干部开展了鸣放辩论。辩论的焦点是：适当的休息到底对生产是有利还是没有利？任务能不能完成？应该如何来关心群众生活？各地用许多的具体事实，就实论虚，统一了思想。大家认为群众日夜苦干的积极性是可贵的，在完成某项紧急任务的时候，加班突击也是可以的，但不能长期不注意休息。解决劳力不足的根本办法不是加班加点，而是技术革命和改进劳动管理。火箭公社在辩论中，回顾了收早插晚时的情况。这个公社原来的加一社和加二社相连在一块，两个社劳力平均负担的水田面积也差不多。加一社一开始“双抢”就干通宵，干过两、三天之后，有些人身体支持不住了，出工人数由二千九百来人减少到二千一百多人，工效慢慢地降低了。加二社在“双抢”紧张时，每天晚上也干，但只干到十二点，每天中午烈日当空的时候，还休息两小时，因此社员精力始终充沛。结果，加二社虽然比加一社慢两天才开始“双抢”，比加一社却早四天完成任务。这样的事例，使大家进一步认识到苦战必须与适当的休整相结合，有劳有逸，才能保护住群众的积极性，并进一步提高劳动效率。
    为了切实保证县委关心群众生活的指示得到贯彻，县里还召开人民公社福利部长现场会。县委已确定一个副书记管群众的生活，各公社都有一个书记或委员管生活，福利部长专门抓生活。
    现在，在一般情况下，这个县的社员每天早上五点起床，接着进行一个小时的军事训练；吃罢早饭出工，中午休息一个多钟头；到六点吃过晚饭以后休息一下，便到各种业余学校去学习文化、政治，有时到俱乐部去看看图书，做做游戏。每个公社都定了休假制度，每月放假二天，半月一次。到了放假的这一天，社里杀猪打牙祭，业余剧团演戏，电影队放电影，俱乐部里挤满了人。小伙子们、姑娘们更是打扮得漂漂亮亮，看戏的看戏，跳舞的跳舞；爱打球的打球，爱下棋的下棋。每个人都愉快的过着自己的假日。
    由于党这样关心群众生活，爱护群众，把劳动与休整结合起来，群众精力充沛，干劲更大，劳动效率更高了。火箭公社放假的第二天拣茶子，每个劳力由原来平均每天拣五担提高到十担，出工人数由总人口的75％增加到83％。全县晚稻、油茶的收获任务和油茶的种植任务已提前在10月底完成，四十八万亩深翻地的任务也完成了。
    新华社西宁7日电　青海省湟源县从制度上保证公社社员有一定休息时间后，劳动效率有显著提高。
    湟源县八个人民公社统一规定，社员劳动半个月休息一天；连续夜战两次后，第三个晚上就不劳动也不开会；加强对食堂和托儿所的领导。这个规定是9月底由县委召开的公社党委书记会议确定的。当时，抢收、深翻、炼铁、修水利等工作挤在一起，社员们的劲头又很足，所以一干就没明没夜。由于社员们缺少必要的休息时间，劳动效率慢慢就降低了。如沸海公社的青年战斗连开始投入抢收时，每人每天割麦一百五十捆，可是连续夜战以后，一天只能割八、九十捆了。有些社员对于没有时间处理家务事也有些意见。县委发现这一情况后，便专门召开各公社党委书记会议，确定从制度上保证社员有一定的休息时间。
    现在，各个公社都严格执行了规定，按时让社员休息和处理个人的事情，如洗衣服、打扫卫生等。集体食堂也大有起色，普遍给老人和儿童另做饭菜。托儿所也将由日托改为全托。社员休息好，吃喝好，妇女不操心孩子，每个人都精力充沛，劳动情绪和效率都普遍提高。以深翻地为例，近来四个人就可以干9月底时五个人的活。社员们都说，有苦战，有休息，人人浑身是劲，一天保干两天活。
