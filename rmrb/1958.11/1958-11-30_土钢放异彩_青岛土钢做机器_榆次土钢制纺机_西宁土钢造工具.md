Indigenous Steel Shines

Qingdao Uses Indigenous Steel to Make Machines Yuci Uses Indigenous Steel to Make Textile Machinery Xining Uses Indigenous Steel to Make Tools

According to the Qingdao Daily, mechanical repair and manufacturing factories in Qingdao broke the "Indigenous Steel and Iron are Useless" theory, overcame technical barriers, and used indigenous steel to manufacture ten kinds of equipment, including large shafts for ore crushers and lead screws for gantry planers, with good quality. The factory used blister steel, after forging and lathe processing, to make a large shaft for an ore crusher, more than four inches thick and one and a half meters long. In the past, this type of shaft was made of four-and-a-half-inch round steel, but the shaft made of indigenous steel also met the standards. The feed grinder shaft made by the factory using indigenous steel achieved an efficiency of 1,500 to 2,000 revolutions per minute, crushing 2,000 jin of bean cake per hour. Qingdao Handicraft Bureau's Seventh Machinery Factory used blister steel to manufacture eight kinds of goods for construction, including screws, ground vehicle axles, mining chisels, picks, and overhead shafts. Qingdao Bicycle Factory used forged steel to make bicycle chains and 18-tooth small sprockets, all of which met quality requirements. Qingdao Jianzhong Machinery Factory, Qingdao Machinery Factory, and other units all used blister steel and forged steel to manufacture various tools and machine parts. Qingdao Steel Rolling Mill used blister steel to roll 19mm round steel and other flat steel, which can be used for civil construction projects and the manufacture of waterwheel double-furrow plows and other parts.

Furthermore, Qingdao Yixiang Machinery Factory, Farm Implement Factory, Vehicle Manufacturing Factory, Shengjian Machinery Factory, and Handicraft Bureau's First Machinery Factory, Seventh Machinery Factory, and Farm Implement Machinery Factory have successively used indigenous steel to make more than 40 kinds of machine parts and tools, many of which are relatively precise parts.

Yixiang Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced 20 kinds of parts using indigenous steel, including blower gears, lathe tool holders, machine tool lead screws, chuck jaws, and exploration rig small gears, large casings, and shafts. Many of these parts were originally made of round steel and required high precision. Parts like machine tool lead screws and chuck jaws not only need to have a certain hardness and be able to withstand a certain pressure, but also need to have a certain toughness. The quality requirements for blower gears and exploration rig small gears are also very high. These parts made of indigenous steel have undergone preliminary appraisal and, although their quality is slightly inferior to those made of round steel, they all meet the requirements. The Farm Implement Factory has recently used blister steel to make axes, trowels, fire tongs, adzes, and the main shaft of an ore crusher. Among them, the main shaft of the ore crusher is 12 cm in diameter and 113 cm long, which is the main component of the crusher. The surface smoothness of these parts is very good, and the spark test shows that they can reach the standard of No. 3 low carbon steel. The ground vehicle axle made by the Vehicle Factory using indigenous steel instead of shaped steel was installed on a ground vehicle, carrying a load of 700 to 800 jin, and operated well. For example, in the First Machinery Factory of the Municipal Handicraft Bureau, in the process of vigorously developing indigenous machines, relying on the wisdom of the masses, blister steel was forged into several parts of the bullhead planer, such as the reversing lever, the large gear planer shaft cap, the connecting three-wheel, and the small figure-eight wheel shaft, which were also found to meet the quality requirements after inspection.

The success of using indigenous steel to manufacture some machine parts has greatly boosted people's confidence in the widespread use of indigenous steel. Recently, Yixiang Machinery Factory is further using indigenous steel to manufacture a lathe.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th -- Shanxi Yuci Jinhua Textile Factory successfully manufactured the three "treasures" on the spinning frame—spindles, rollers, and travelers—using self-smelted indigenous steel, and assembled them into a 200-spindle spinning frame. After trial operation, the quality of the yarn spun met the standards.

This spinning frame was manufactured by the workers of the electromechanical workshop of Jinhua Textile Factory. In addition to the three major components of spindles, rollers, and travelers being made of indigenous steel, the frame is assembled from wood and old steel parts. This type of textile machine is very suitable for small and medium-sized textile factories.

Jinhua Textile Factory has already smelted more than 400 tons of indigenous steel in the mass steelmaking movement and is still continuing to smelt. They plan to use all of this indigenous steel to manufacture textile machines.

This newspaper reports that Xining City's Xinsheng Casting Factory and other factories in Qinghai Province have forged various tools using self-produced indigenous iron and steel and have begun putting them into production.

The Xinsheng Casting Factory used steel smelted from small converters to make steel hammers, sledgehammers, axes, chisels, pliers, files, and steel drills; steel smelted from low-temperature reverberatory furnaces was forged into steel hammers of various weights.

This factory has now built 54 low-temperature reverberatory furnaces. In order to solve the problem of hammer steel tools, it recently specially organized two forging teams to forge sledgehammers using steel smelted by indigenous methods. More than 30 various tools have been made, and no breakage has been found in use. The Xinsheng Casting Factory will adhere to the spirit of self-production, self-manufacturing, and self-use, and will systematically forge various tools.

    土钢放异彩
    青岛土钢做机器  榆次土钢制纺机  西宁土钢造工具
    据青岛日报报道　青岛市各机械修配制造工厂，打破了“土钢土铁无用论”，突破了技术关，用土钢制成了矿石粉碎机大轴、龙门刨床丝杠等十种器材，质量良好。这厂用炒钢经过锻打和车床加工，制成的矿石粉碎机大轴，有四吋多粗，一点五公尺长。这种轴过去是用四吋半的元钢制造，而用土钢制造的轴也同样达到了标准。该厂用土钢制成的饲料粉碎机轴，效能达到每分钟一千五百转到两千转，每小时粉碎豆饼两千斤。青岛手工业局第七机械厂，用炒钢制造建筑用的螺丝、地排车轴、开矿用的錾、洋镐、吊挂的天轴等八种商品。青岛自行车厂用锻钢制成自行车链子、十八牙的小牙盘等质量均达到要求。青岛建中机械厂、青岛机械厂等单位，均用炒钢、锻钢制造了多种工具和机件。青岛轧钢厂用炒钢轧成了十九公厘的元钢和其他扁钢，可以用于民用建筑工程及制造水车双铧犁等部件。
    又讯　青岛市义祥机械厂、农具厂、车辆制造厂、生建机械厂及手工业局第一机械厂、第七机械厂和农具机械厂等单位，先后利用土钢制成四十多种机械部件和工具，其中有许多还是较为精密的部件。
    义祥机械厂用土钢共试制成功鼓风机齿轮、车床刀架子、工作母机丝杠、卡盘爪子，和勘探机小齿轮、大套管、轴等二十种部件。这些部件中有许多原来都是利用元钢制造，要求较精密。像工作母机丝杠、卡盘爪子等，不仅要有一定的硬度，能够负担一定的压力，而且还要求达到一定的韧度。鼓风机齿轮和勘探机小齿轮等部件的质量要求也很高。现在用土钢制成的这些部件经过初步鉴定，质量稍逊于用元钢制造的，都达到了要求。农具厂最近也用炒钢制成斧头、瓦刀、火钳、锛子和矿石粉碎机的主轴等。其中矿石粉碎机的主轴直径十二公分，长一百一十三公分，是粉碎机的主要部件。这些部件的表面光滑度都很好，经鉴定火花，可以达到三号低碳钢的标准。车辆厂用土钢代替型钢制成的地排车轴，安装在地排车上，载重七、八百斤，运转良好。再如市手工业局第一机械厂在大搞土机器中，依靠群众的智慧，用炒钢锻造出牛头刨床的倒进拨把、大牙轮刨轴帽、连三轮、小八字轮轴等几种部件，经过检验也完全合乎质量要求。
    利用土钢制造一些机械部件的成功，大大鼓舞了人们广泛利用土钢的信心。最近，义祥机械厂正在进一步用土钢制造一部车床。
    据新华社太原29日电　山西榆次晋华纺织厂用自炼的土钢制造成功细纱机上的三件“宝”——纱锭、罗拉和纲领，并用它们装配成一台二百纱锭的细纱机。经过试运转，纺出来的细纱质量合乎标准。
    这台细纱机是晋华纺织厂机电车间的工人们制造的。它除了纱锭、罗拉和纲领三大部件是土钢制造的以外，机架是用木材和旧钢铁零件装配起来的。这种纺织机很适合中小型纺织厂使用。
    晋华纺织厂在全民办钢铁运动中已经炼出土钢四百多吨，现在还在继续冶炼，他们计划把这些土钢都用来制造纺织机。
    本报讯　青海省新生铸件厂和西宁市用自产的土钢铁锻制成各种工具，并开始投入生产。
    新生铸件厂用小转炉炼的钢，制成了钢锤、鎯头、斧头、凿子、钳子、锉子和钢钎；用低温反射土炼钢炉炼的钢锻打了多种重量的钢锤。
    这个厂现已建起了五十四个低温反射炉，为解决锤钢工具，最近专门组织了两个锻工组，用土法炼成钢锻制鎯锤。现已制成的各种工具三十多件，在使用中尚未发现有断坏现象。新生铸件厂将本着自产、自制、自用的精神，有计划的锻制各种工具。
