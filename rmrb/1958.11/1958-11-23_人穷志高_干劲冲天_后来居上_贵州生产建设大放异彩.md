Poor But Determined, Energetic, Surpassing Others
    Guizhou's Production and Construction Shines

    (Our Dispatch) This reporter, Wu Zhenquan, reports: Under the radiant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the more than sixteen million people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province, like a giant with infinite power and wisdom, have begun to write the newest and most beautiful words and draw the newest and most beautiful pictures on a blank sheet of paper.

    In just over ten months this year, the annual plans for many tasks have been fulfilled. Agricultural production has reversed the past practice of extensive cultivation with low yields and has striven for an all-round Great Leap Forward, fundamentally solving the food problem. The total output of 24 million mu of grain crops in the province has doubled compared to last year, reaching 21 billion jin, exceeding ahead of schedule the target of 800 jin per mu stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), and more than 20 counties have achieved grain yields of over 1,000 jin per mu. The average grain possession per person in the province has increased from 624 jin last year to over 1,200 jin. Many regions have achieved today's achievements through a great revolution in agricultural technology, completely eliminating the primitive farming methods of "slash-and-burn" and "shifting cultivation." Various major cash crops, whether tobacco, hemp, silk, tea, oilseeds, or cotton, have all increased production. The total output of flue-cured tobacco reached 2.4 million dan, more than double that of last year. The achievements of the Great Leap Forward in steel production are even more astonishing. As of the beginning of this month, iron smelting has produced more than 550,000 tons of pig iron, exceeding the state plan by more than four times. As of the same date, steel production reached more than 20,000 tons, completing more than 60% of the state plan. This is the result of the hard work day and night of the three million-strong army on the steel front, breaking through thousands of barriers and overcoming all kinds of difficulties. The achievements of the Great Leap Forward in mechanical industrial production are equally enormous. Only eight medium-sized machine factories in Guiyang City, with outdated equipment, produced 110 sets of equipment capable of producing 800,000 tons of steel (each set of equipment includes converters, cupolas, motors, blowers) and a 250 cm rolling mill from July to October. As the "marshal" has ascended, the "vanguard" is even faster. The Du(yun)-Gui(yang) section of the Qian-Gui Railway will be open to traffic recently. This railway, which is more than 600 kilometers long, will be the first railway built in Guizhou Province. The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway and the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway are both under accelerated construction. After the completion of these railways, Guiyang will become the largest transportation hub in Southwest China. Following the start of construction of the large-scale hydropower station - Maotiao River Hydropower Station - and the first domestically-produced 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator set of the newly built thermal power plant in Guiyang has begun to generate electricity, the preparatory work for the construction of the large-scale Wujiang Hydropower Station with huge hydropower has also begun.

    Why has a province with barren land, a consistent lack of food, that has never smelted a ton of steel, manufactured steel-making equipment, or had a railway, been able to achieve such great results in such a short period of time? This question can be answered in a nutshell: "People are poor, but their aspirations are particularly high." After the Rectification Campaign, the political awareness of the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and they have established the great ambition of building socialism. The resounding battle cry and goal of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, which calls for three years of hard work to fundamentally change the backward economic face of the province, is an enormous encouragement to the people of all ethnic groups. In their work, Party committees at all levels go deep among the masses, secretaries take the lead, and specific requirements and measures for increasing agricultural production and developing local industries are put forward according to the time and place. A province-wide red flag competition movement for agricultural production increase and a technological innovation movement for industry are widely carried out, and inspections are organized in a timely manner. All these measures ensure that the province's construction cause advances along the correct path, so that the aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups are increasing day by day, and their enthusiasm for overcoming difficulties is becoming stronger and stronger. The increasingly high enthusiasm and creativity of the people of all ethnic groups have condensed into endless power, creating miracles and promoting the acceleration of construction.

    At present, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the people of the province, in addition to seizing the opportunity to create greater achievements in the last two months of this year to welcome the New Year, are also actively preparing for next year, and striving for a greater leap forward in industry and agriculture next year.

### 人穷志高　干劲冲天　后来居上  贵州生产建设大放异彩

    人穷志高　干劲冲天　后来居上
    贵州生产建设大放异彩
    本报讯　记者吴振全报道：在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，贵州省一千六百多万各族人民，像一个有无穷的力量和智慧的巨人，开始在一张白纸上写最新最美的文字，画最新最美的图画。
    今年才过了十个多月，各项工作的年计划，许多都实现了。农业生产，一反过去耕作粗放广种薄收的作法，争来了全面大跃进，从根本解决了粮食问题。全省二千四百万亩粮食作物总产量比去年翻了一番，达到二百一十亿斤，提前超额实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的亩产八百斤的指标，并且出现了二十多个粮食亩产千斤县。全省平均每人占有粮食由去年的六百二十四斤上升到一千二百多斤。许多地区是经过农业技术大革命，彻底去掉“刀耕火种”、“轮歇游垦”的原始耕作方法，才获得今天的成就的。各种主要经济作物，不论烟、麻、丝、茶和油料、棉花，样样增产。烤烟总产量达二百四十万担，比去年增加二倍多。钢铁生产大跃进的成就更为惊人。炼铁生产，至本月上旬，已生产生铁五十五万多吨，超额四倍多完成了国家计划。到同日止，钢的产量达二万多吨，已完成国家计划的60％以上。这是钢铁战线上三百万大军闯千关、破万难，日夜苦战取得的成绩。机械工业生产大跃进的成就同样巨大。仅贵阳市的八个中型设备陈旧的机械厂，从7月到10月，生产出了能炼钢八十万吨的一百一十套设备（每套设备包括转炉、化铁炉、电动机、鼓风机）和一台二百五十厘米的轧钢机。随着“元帅”的升帐，“先行”更是快马加鞭。黔桂铁路的都（匀）贵（阳）段，将于最近通车。这条全长六百多公里的铁路，将是贵州省内第一条首先建成的铁路。川黔铁路和滇黔铁路都正在加速修建。这些铁路建成后，将使贵阳成为祖国西南最大的交通枢纽站。继大型水电站——猫跳河水电站动工兴建和贵阳新建火力发电厂第一套国产六千瓩汽轮发电机组开始发电后，水力巨大的乌江大型水力发电站也开始筹备兴建。
    一个土地贫瘠，一向缺乏粮食，从来没有炼出过一吨钢，没制造过炼钢设备，没有一条铁路的省份，为什么在短短的时间内能取得这样巨大的成绩呢？可用一句话来概括地回答这个问题，就是“人贫而志气特高”。经过整风运动，贵州各族人民的政治觉悟空前提高，他们立下了建设社会主义的大志。中共贵州省委所提出的苦战三年，基本改变全省落后经济面貌的响亮战斗口号和目标，对各族人民更是一个莫大的鼓舞。在工作中，各级党委深入群众，书记挂帅，因时因地地提出农业增产和发展地方工业的具体要求和措施，广泛地开展农业增产的红旗竞赛运动和工业的技术革新运动，并及时地组织检查。所有这些措施，保证了全省建设事业沿着正确的道路前进，使各族人民的志气日益增高，克服困难的干劲越鼓越足。各族人民日益高涨的积极性和创造性，沤成了无穷无尽的力量，创造奇迹，推动建设事业加速地前进。
    目前，全省人民根据省委的指示，除去抓紧时机，要在今年最后的两个月中，创造出更大的成绩来迎接新年以外，并已积极为明年作准备，为争取明年工农业的更大跃进而奋斗。（附图片）
