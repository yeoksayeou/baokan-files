    The Red Flag of the October Revolution
    -- Introducing the Color Documentary "The Light of October"
    An Jing
    Forty-one years ago, the ancient Russia raised an eternally burning torch of revolution. Since then, the light of the October Revolution has illuminated the revolutionary path of all progressive humanity. The Soviet color documentary recorded this immortal historical fact, and using rich materials, it concentratedly expressed the tremendous and profound impact of the October Revolution on the revolutions of all countries with a high degree of artistic generalization. It vividly demonstrates that the revolutionary forces of the world have converged into an irresistible torrent, and are continuing to develop forward with the force of thunder!
    The film begins with the parades of the people of the Soviet Union and China celebrating the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution. Then, a few concise and beautiful pictures show the enormous and solid strength of the socialist camp: the sun has just sunk on the banks of the blue Danube in Eastern Europe, and the people of Beijing are welcoming the golden dawn; blizzards are still howling madly in the Soviet Arctic, while tropical fruits in Vietnam are already ripe. One-third of the world's population who have been liberated live in this vast, rich and beautiful socialist family. Common great ideals unite them like an iron Great Wall...
    However, victory does not come easily. It is the result of a harsh struggle under the guidance of our pioneers. The film takes us back to the sacred and glorious moment of the October Revolution forty-one years ago. We see how the revolutionary sailors fired the first cannon shot of historical significance at the Winter Palace, how the progressive people of the whole world welcomed the birth of the new Soviet Republic with excitement, and how, under the influence of the October Revolution, revolutions broke out in Germany and Hungary one after another, establishing their own regimes; we also see how the light of the October Revolution shone to the most remote places on the earth, to India, to China... The people of the East roared!
    Here, the crimes of the imperialists and reactionary rulers in strangling the revolution are also exposed. The dense bayonets, the frantic arrests, and the bloody massacres aroused our strong hatred. Nevertheless, the flames of revolution are still burning everywhere. The martyrs sacrificed themselves, but they are always respected and mourned by the people, and they sowed the seeds of revolution in the hearts of the people. The film illustrates this point with some moving facts. Remembering the heroic deeds of the revolutionary martyrs further inspires our fighting spirit and gives us tremendous spiritual strength.
    More space is devoted to showing the glorious achievements of the people of socialist countries in peaceful construction. Those groups of rich and poetic shots are a hymn to peaceful labor and an ode to the power of the people. Here, we see with our own eyes that Warsaw, which had become a ruin, has once again become a beautiful and beautiful city; the Danube Bridge between the two districts of Budapest and Pest, the capital of Hungary, which was destroyed in the war, is connected in the hands of fitters and welders. Countries that had no industry in the past now have towering chimneys, rumbling machines, and sparks of steelmaking and ironmaking flying, and black gold - oil - gushing out from the ground... And all this is inseparable from the leadership of the parties in various countries. The film vividly shows the strong leadership of the Party in the cause of peaceful construction. The shots of the leaders and the masses together are so kind and so exciting.
    Peace and friendship are the most intimate and moving words in human language. The film also sings with unparalleled passion the great unity of the international communist movement, and sings the mutual support and lofty friendship of people in struggle. When the Soviet Union existed only as a single socialist country, workers and working people from all countries supported them in all aspects; and when fascist bandits dropped murderous bombs in the clear sky of Spain, workers and brothers from all countries supported the just struggle of the Spanish people. In particular, in recent years, the mutual assistance and support of socialist countries in peaceful construction have demonstrated the noble spirit of internationalism. When American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, the Chinese people sent volunteers to fight alongside them. When they felt that their strength was insufficient in their construction, Soviet, German, and Polish engineering technicians appeared on the construction sites of Korea. This is how the people of socialist countries selflessly build a better future for their motherland. And the story of the Hiroshima rose is also extremely touching. When the Hitler bandits retaliated against the resistance of Czech patriots, the Czech village of Lidice was completely destroyed. Men were shot, and women and children were imprisoned in concentration camps. After the war, the village of Lidice was rebuilt. All the cities that had suffered the disaster of war sent roses to Lidice to express their respect, so the Hiroshima roses also bloomed in Lidice. Doesn't the bright red and delicate rose also express people's sincere blessings and heartfelt yearning for "peace and friendship"?
    Naturally, imperialist interference and provocation have not stopped, but history has proven that no matter how rampant the enemy is, their fate of being eliminated will come sooner or later. Under the light of the October Revolution, people will surely be able to send imperialism to the grave, and people must hold high the victorious red flag of the October Revolution and continue to advance firmly on the broad road of communism!

    十月革命的红旗
    ——介绍彩色纪录片“十月的光芒”
    安京
    四十一年前，古老的俄罗斯升起了永不熄灭的革命火炬。从此，十月革命的光芒，就照亮了全体进步人类的革命道路。苏联彩色文献纪录片纪录了这不朽的史实，并且运用了丰富的资料，以高度的艺术概括，集中地表现了十月革命对于世界各国革命的巨大而深刻的影响，形象地表明：全世界革命力量汇成了一股不可阻挡的洪流，正以雷霆万钧之势不断地继续向前发展！
    影片从苏、中两国人民庆祝十月革命四十一周年的游行开始，紧接着，几幅简洁优美的画面，就显示出社会主义阵营巨大坚实的力量：太阳刚刚从东欧的兰色的多瑙河畔沉没，北京的人民又在迎接着金色的黎明；暴风雪还在苏联北极拼命的狂吼，而越南的热带果实却已经成熟。获得了解放的占世界人口三分之一的人生活在这辽阔、富饶而又美丽的社会主义大家庭里，共同的伟大的理想，使他们团结得像一座铁的长城……
    然而，胜利不是轻易得来的。那是在我们的先行者的指引下，进行了严酷斗争后取得的结果。影片把我们带回到四十一年前十月革命那神圣而又光荣的时刻。我们看到革命的水兵怎样向冬宫发射了具有历史意义的第一炮，全世界进步人类如何兴奋若狂地欢迎新的苏维埃共和国的诞生，看到在十月革命浪潮的影响下，德国、匈牙利相继暴发了革命，建立了自己的政权；也看到十月革命的光芒怎样照到地球上最遥远的地方，照到了印度，照到了中国……东方的人民怒吼了！
    这里也揭露了帝国主义者、反动统治者扼杀革命的罪行，那森森然的刺刀，那疯狂的逮捕，那血腥的屠杀，激起了我们强烈的仇恨。尽管如此，革命的烈火仍然四处燃烧。先烈们牺牲了，他们却永远受着人们的尊敬凭吊，他们在人们心中播下了革命的种子。影片以一些动人的事实表明了这一点。缅怀革命先烈的英雄事迹，愈加激励了我们的斗志，给予我们巨大的精神力量。
    更多的篇幅是表现社会主义国家的人民从事和平建设事业的光辉业绩的。那一组组内容丰富的、充满诗意的镜头，是对于和平劳动的礼赞，是对于人民力量的讴歌。在这里，我们亲眼看到，那已经变成一片废墟的华沙重新又变成了一座美好漂亮的城市；在战争中被毁坏的匈牙利首都—布达和佩斯两个区中间的多瑙河大桥，在钳工和焊工的手中联结起来。过去没有工业的国家，现在烟囱林立，机器隆隆，炼钢炼铁的花火飞迸，黑色的金子——石油，从地底滚滚流出……而这些都是和各国的党的领导分不开的。影片鲜明地显示了党在和平建设事业中的坚强的领导，领袖们和群众在一起的镜头，是如此亲切、如此激动人心。
    和平与友谊，这是人类语言中最为亲切动人的语句。影片也以无比的激情，歌颂了国际共产主义运动的伟大团结，歌颂了人们在斗争中的相互支援和崇高的友谊。远在苏联还仅是作为一个单独的社会主义国家存在时，各国工人和劳动人民就从各方面支持了他们；而当法西斯匪徒在西班牙的晴空扔下了杀人的炸弹时，各国工人兄弟又纷纷支持西班牙人民的正义斗争。特别是在近几年来社会主义各国在和平建设中的互相帮助和支援，更显示了人们崇高的国际主义精神。当美帝国主义发动侵朝战争的时候，中国人民派出了志愿军和他们并肩战斗，当他们进行建设而感到自己力量不足时，苏联、德国、波兰的工程技术人员又出现在朝鲜的工地上。社会主义各国人民就是这样忘我的建设着自己祖国美好的未来。而那广岛玫瑰花的故事，也是极其感人的。当希特勒匪徒对捷克爱国者的抵抗进行报复时，捷克的利吉茨村被完全摧毁了。男人被枪杀，妇女和孩子被关进集中营。战争结束了，利吉茨村又重新建立起来。凡是经受战争灾祸的城市都给利吉茨村赠送玫瑰花，表示尊敬，于是广岛的玫瑰花也盛开在利吉茨村中。那艳红娇美的玫瑰花，不正也说出了人们对于“和平与友谊”的真诚的祝福和衷心的向往么？
    自然，帝国主义的干涉和挑衅并没有停止，然而历史证明，不管敌人怎么猖獗，他们最终被消灭的命运是迟早总要到来的。在十月革命的光芒照耀下，人们一定能够把帝国主义送进坟墓里去，人们一定要高擎着十月革命的胜利红旗，继续坚定不移地向着共产主义的康庄大道前进！
