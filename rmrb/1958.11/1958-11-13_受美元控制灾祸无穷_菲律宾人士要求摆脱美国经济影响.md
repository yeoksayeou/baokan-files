Under dollar control, disaster is endless.
Filipinos demand to shake off U.S. economic influence.

This newspaper reports: Several government officials and newspapers in the Philippines have accused the United States of harming the Philippine economy and demanded to shake off U.S. influence. According to a report in the "Manila Chronicle" on the 10th, Philippine Labor Minister Castano said on the 8th that "as long as the Philippine peso is linked to the U.S. dollar, the economic situation in the Philippines will never improve."

Speaking at a Rotary Club meeting in Marolos, Castano called on the government to adopt a multiple currency reserve system to overcome the Philippines' critical economic difficulties. He said that the Philippines' current economy, which is linked to the U.S. dollar, is an obstacle to expanding foreign trade.

Philippine Chamber of Commerce President Barabat pointed out at another Rotary Club meeting in Marolos that the U.S.-Philippines trade agreement signed in 1955 should be re-examined in order to eliminate the source of resentment caused by the U.S.'s distorted interpretation of the current U.S.-Philippines agreements.

Due to U.S. control of the Philippine economy, it occupies a very large proportion of the Philippines' foreign trade. According to the 1957 Philippine foreign trade statistics compiled by the Philippine Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, the United States accounted for 55.03% of the Philippines' total foreign trade in 1957, ranking first in the Philippines' foreign trade, while the deficit in the Philippines' foreign trade this year amounted to more than 381.4 million pesos.

In addition, the Philippine National Bank had earlier predicted in a report that the Philippines' international balance of payments would be reduced due to the impact of the U.S. economic crisis. In fact, the Philippines' foreign exchange reserves have been declining every month. In March of last year, the Philippines' foreign exchange reserves were 220 million pesos, while in March of this year, they were only 150 million pesos, and in July of this year, they further dropped to 134 million pesos.

    受美元控制灾祸无穷
    菲律宾人士要求摆脱美国经济影响
    本报讯　菲律宾若干政府人士和报纸指责美国危害菲律宾经济的行为，要求摆脱美国的影响。据“马尼拉先驱报”10日报道，菲律宾劳工部长卡斯塔诺在8日说，“只要菲律宾的比索同美元联系着，菲律宾的经济情况永远不会有改进。”
    卡斯塔诺在玛洛洛斯的扶轮社集会上发表演说时，要求政府采取多种通货储备制度，以克服菲律宾危急的经济困难。他说，菲律宾目前同美元联系的经济是扩大对外贸易的障碍。
    菲律宾商会主席巴拉巴特在玛洛洛斯扶轮社另一次集会上指出，为了消除由于美国对菲美间现行协定的歪曲解释而引起愤恨的根源，现在应该重新研究1955年菲美签订的贸易协定。
    由于美国对菲律宾经济的控制，使得它在菲律宾的对外贸易中占有极大的比重。据菲律宾调查统计局编制的1957年菲律宾对外贸易统计表明，在1957年美国占了菲律宾对外贸易总额的55.03％，占菲律宾对外贸易的第一位，而这一年菲律宾对外贸易的逆差竟多达三亿八千一百四十多万比索。
    此外，菲律宾国家银行在早些时候曾在一个报告中预言，由于受到美国经济危机的影响，菲律宾的国际收支将要减少。而实际上菲律宾的外汇储备每月都在下降，去年3月菲律宾的外汇储备为二亿二千万比索，今年3月只有一亿五千万比索，今年7月更下降到一亿三千四百万比索。
