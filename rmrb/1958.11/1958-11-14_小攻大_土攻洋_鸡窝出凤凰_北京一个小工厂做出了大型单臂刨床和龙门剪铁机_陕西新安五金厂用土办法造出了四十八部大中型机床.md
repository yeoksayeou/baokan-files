Small Overcomes Large, Indigenous Overcomes Foreign, A Phoenix Emerges from a Chicken Coop
	A small factory in Beijing produces a large single-arm planer and a gantry shear; Xin'an Hardware Factory in Shaanxi uses indigenous methods to build forty-eight large and medium-sized machine tools.

	(Our Newspaper) A dilapidated small factory that used to make knives, ice skates, and pickaxes—the Beijing Metal Processing Factory—produced a 50-ton, 6-meter-long single-arm planer, a 20-plus-ton gantry shear capable of shearing 5-foot-wide, 1-inch-thick steel plates, and a precision lathe equipped with 100 gears during the mass technical revolution campaign.

	The Beijing Metal Processing Factory was a small factory formed by the merger of seventeen small factories. It was originally a waste processing plant. The factory's workshops were all dilapidated, low-rise civilian houses, and most of the lathes in the factory were "antiques" from forty or fifty years ago. There were also very few technicians, and most of the work was done manually.

	In July of this year, the factory's employees visited the Beijing Civilian Lighting Factory and the Yushengxiang Motor Factory, among others. They were deeply moved by the soaring enthusiasm of the workers there. After returning to the factory, they reflected: the equipment and conditions in those factories are not as good as ours, so why can they achieve such great results while we cannot?

	Based on this situation, the Party organization decided to launch a high tide of technical revolution throughout the factory in September, and put forward a clear slogan: "Transform our factory from a processing plant into a machinery manufacturing plant." Subsequently, the factory's Party, government, labor union, and youth league held separate discussion meetings to discuss how to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization in a short period of time.

	As a result of the discussions, it was decided to trial-produce a C618K-type lathe. This lathe has more than 100 gears inside, which is very difficult to make. They disassembled a lathe of the same type, took out the large and small gears inside one by one, like a hedgehog, numbered them, stamped them, and recorded them in a notebook. Then they made them one by one according to the records. After they were made, they installed them one by one according to the original machine. As a result, it was made in less than twenty days, and its performance was exactly the same as that of a large machinery factory's product.

	Next, they also manufactured a 50-ton, 6-meter-long single-arm planer. No factory in Beijing had ever made this kind of machine tool before. The worktable alone weighed 10 tons, while the factory's cupola furnace could only melt two tons of iron per hour. If the iron were tapped five times, where would the molten iron be stored? If the molten iron cooled down, it could not be used. What should be done? Everyone decided to remove a layer of refractory bricks from the furnace lining, so that three tons of iron could be melted in one hour, but this still did not solve the problem. The factory director, workshop director, and workers studied together. The workers proposed making a 12-ton molten iron ladle in front of the cupola furnace. After it was made, it failed once. The molten iron solidified inside. They were not discouraged. After repeated research, they decided to add a blower, enlarge the tuyere, and increase the preheating temperature of the front furnace. In this way, the temperature of the molten iron rose to 1400 degrees Celsius. This problem was solved, but how to transport so much molten iron to the workshop? Without a large crane, the workers built a 17-meter-long trough at the mouth of the furnace for direct casting. This saved both vehicles and was safe. After these problems were solved, there was another big problem: how big should the sand box be? If a whole sand box were made, at least a 12-ton crane would be needed to lift it, but the factory only had a 5-ton crane. The workers came up with a "split box molding" method. They made three sections of sand box and cast them together. After the casting was done, because the crane's power was not enough, the workers used the "snake swallowing a frog" method, first lifting one end, and then using wood to support it. Then, they lifted the other end, and then put wooden rollers and iron rollers under the casting and pulled it by people. Now this single-arm planer with a 6-meter-long body is about to be successfully installed.

	This factory has also successfully trial-produced eleven new products such as blowers and winches. They also pieced together many strangely shaped but very useful boring machines, grinding machines, drill-grinding dual-purpose machines, and shaping machines from scrap iron. Some machines were too short to operate, so they dug a pit in the ground and people stood inside to work.

	According to statistics, they have improved a total of more than 300 tools and operating methods.

	The employees are in high spirits and are preparing to make twelve 50-ton single-arm planers, one hundred belt pulley lathes, thirty automatic lathes, and four hundred and fifty winches in the fourth quarter. Next year, they will mainly produce heavy machinery.

	Many people who visited this factory said that ants can spit out elephants, which is really amazing.

	(Our Newspaper) Xin'an Hardware Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Shaanxi Province, has adopted the method of using indigenous methods to overcome foreign methods and using small to overcome large methods to manufacture a large number of machine tools, which has solved the problem of insufficient mechanical equipment.

	Xin'an Hardware Factory was originally a repair shop with insufficient equipment. They had neither large factory buildings, nor large machine tools, nor large lifting equipment. However, the situation of the Great Leap Forward required them to manufacture products such as bearings, gas engines, boiler-towing machines, and boilers. In this situation, according to the spirit of arming themselves, they relied on their own efforts and used indigenous methods to design and manufacture whatever machine tools were needed in production. From January to September this year, they manufactured more than twenty kinds of large and medium-sized machine tools, totaling forty-eight units, accounting for about 60% of all large and medium-sized machine tools in the factory.

	The various machine tools manufactured by this factory using indigenous methods not only have the same efficiency as ordinary machine tools, but also have low costs and are easy to manufacture, immediately meeting the needs of production. These machine tools include a gantry planer with a total length of 12 meters, a bed weighing about 20 tons, and a tool holder weighing 1 ton; a press with a height of 3.5 meters, a square of 2.2 meters, and a weight of 10 tons; and an internal cylindrical grinder with a complex structure and precise parts, with more than 1,000 kinds of parts, and the smallest part with a diameter of only 4 mm. The hot rolling mill currently being manufactured can replace the heavy physical labor of more than 80 forgers. These machine tools manufactured by indigenous methods are of good quality, high efficiency, low cost, and quick to manufacture. Taking a semi-automatic special lathe as an example, from design to trial production, two people used five days to manufacture it successfully. It is easy to operate, and ordinary workers can operate it. The production efficiency is also about seven times higher than that of ordinary lathes, and the cost is only about one-tenth of that of ordinary lathes.

    小攻大  土攻洋  鸡窝出凤凰
    北京一个小工厂做出了大型单臂刨床和龙门剪铁机  陕西新安五金厂用土办法造出了四十八部大中型机床
    本报讯　一个做小刀、冰刀和洋镐的破烂小工厂——北京市金属加工厂，在发动群众大闹技术革命运动中，生产出重五十吨长六公尺的单臂刨床、二十多吨重能剪五尺宽一寸厚钢板的龙门剪铁机和装有一百个齿轮的精密车床。
    北京市金属加工厂是由十七个小工厂合并起来的一个小厂，原先是个废品加工厂。这个厂的车间全是破破烂烂的小矮民房，厂里的车床大多是四、五十年前的“老古董”，技术人员也没有几个，大部分工作是用手工操作。
    今年7月，这个厂的职工去北京市民用灯具厂和裕生祥电机厂等厂参观，看见人家的干劲冲天，他们很感动，回厂后他们反映：人家厂里的设备和条件不如咱们，为什么人家能做出那么大的成绩，咱怎么就不能？
    根据这种情况，党组织决定9月在全厂揭起一个技术革命的高潮，并提出一个鲜明的口号：“把我厂由加工厂改成机械制造厂”。接着厂里的党、政、工、团分别召开座谈会，讨论怎样在短时间里实现机械化半机械化？
    讨论结果，决定试制一台C618K型的车床。这车床里面有一百多个齿轮，很难作。他们拆了一台同类型的车床，把里面像刺猬一样的大大小小的牙轮一个一个拿下来，编了号，打了印，记到本子上。然后一件一件照着做。做好又一件一件照原来机器的样子安上去。结果不到二十天就做出来了，性能和大机械厂的产品一模一样。
    接着，他们还制造了一台五十吨重六公尺长的单臂刨床。这种机床全北京没一个工厂作过。一个床面就有十吨重，而厂子里的冲天炉一个钟头才能化两吨铁水。如果分五次出铁水，铁水存在哪里？铁水放凉了，就不能用了，怎么办？大家决定把炉膛里的耐火砖取出一层，这样一小时能化三吨铁水，但这还不能解决问题。厂长、车间主任和工人在一起研究，工人提出在冲天炉前做一个十二吨的铁水包。作好后，试验了一次失败了，铁水流到里面凝结了，他们没有灰心，经反复研究，决定加一个风机，把风眼改大，把前炉预温温度提高，这样一来，铁水温度就上升到一千四百度了。这个问题解决了，但怎么把这么多的铁水运到车间？没有大吊车工人们就在炉口做了一条十七公尺长的龙沟，直流浇铸口，这样又省车又安全。这些问题解决以后，还有个大难题：砂箱做多大？要是做一个整砂箱，起码得要十二吨的吊车才能吊起，而工厂只有五吨重的吊车，工人又动脑筋，想出一个“分箱造型”法，他们做了三节砂箱，拼在一起铸造。铸造好了，因天车力量不够，工人就用“蛇吞蛤蟆”的办法，先吊一头，吊起来用木头支起，再吊另一头，然后把木滚子和铁滚放在铸件下，用人拉。现在这台车身长六公尺的单臂刨床马上就要安装成功了。
    这个厂还试制成功了鼓风机、卷扬机等十一种新产品。他们还用废铁拼凑成许多奇形怪状但很好用的搪床、磨床、钻磨两用床和牛头刨床。有的机器太矮，没法操作，他们就在地下挖个坑，人站在里面工作。
    据统计，他们改进工具和操作方法一共三百多项。
    职工们情绪很高，准备在第四季度制作十二台五十吨重的单臂刨床，一百台皮带轮车床，三十台自动车床，四百五十台卷扬机。明年，他们就主要生产重型机械了。
    许多人参观了这个厂后说，蚂蚁嘴里能吐出大象，真了不起。
    本报讯　陕西省地方国营新安五金厂采取以土攻洋，以小攻大的办法，制造了大量的机床，解决了机械设备不足的问题。
    新安五金厂原是一个设备不足的修配厂，他们一无大厂房、二无大机床、三无大型起重设备，但是，大跃进的形势却要求他们制造轴承、煤气机、锅驼机、锅炉等产品，在这种情况下，根据自己武装自己的精神，生产中需用什么机床，就自力更生、因陋就简，用土办法自己设计制造什么机床。从今年元月到9月份，就制造了二十多种共四十八部大中型机床，占该厂所有大中型机床中的60％左右。
    这个厂用土办法制造的各种机床，不仅效能与一般机床相同，而且成本低，制造简便，立即满足了生产中的需要。这些机床中有全长达十二公尺、床身重达二十吨左右、刀架重达一吨重龙门刨床；有高三点五公尺，二点二公尺见方、体重十吨的压力机；有结构复杂，机件精密的内圆磨床，它的零件就有一千种以上，最小的零件直径只有四公厘。目前正在制造中的热轧机，就可以代替八十多名锻工的繁重的体力劳动，这些用土办法制造出来的机床质量很好，效能高，成本低，制造快。以半自动专用车床为例，从设计到试车生产，两个人用了五天时间就制造成功了，操作方便，普通工人就可以操作，生产效率也较一般车床高七倍左右，造价只相当一般车床的十分之一。
