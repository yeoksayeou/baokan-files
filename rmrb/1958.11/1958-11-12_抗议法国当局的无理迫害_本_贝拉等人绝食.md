    Protesting Unjust Persecution by French Authorities
    Ben Bella and Others on Hunger Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, November 11th, Paris: Leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front, including Ben Bella, First Deputy Prime Minister of the Algerian Provisional Government, began a hunger strike on October 29th to protest the French authorities' treatment of Bita, the Minister of State of the Algerian Provisional Government who was illegally sentenced to imprisonment, as an ordinary criminal. Under their resolute struggle and the condemnation of people worldwide, the French authorities have now been forced to grant Bita the status of a political prisoner and to rescind their decision to deny Ben Bella and others political prisoner status after they began their hunger strike.
    Bita has stated that he will continue his hunger strike until the French authorities cease treating the other fifteen Algerian patriots illegally imprisoned with him as ordinary criminals.

    抗议法国当局的无理迫害
    本·贝拉等人绝食
    据新华社11日电　巴黎消息：包括阿尔及利亚临时政府第一副总理本·贝拉在内的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领袖为了抗议法国当局把非法判处徒刑的阿尔及利亚临时政府国务部长比塔当作普通罪犯，在10月29日开始了绝食。在他们的坚决斗争和全世界人民的指责之下，法国当局现在已经不得不给比塔以政治犯待遇，也不得不取消在本·贝拉等人绝食后拒绝给他们政治犯待遇的决定。
    比塔表示将继续绝食，直到法国当局不把同他一起被非法囚禁的另外十五个阿尔及利亚爱国者当作普通罪犯时为止。
