Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th: This reporter Zhang Xinmin reports: "The chemical industry gives us bread, gives us prosperity, gives us a bright future!" This is a moving slogan put forward to the people of the German Democratic Republic by the First Chemical Industry Conference of the German Democratic Republic, recently held at the "Ulbricht Factory" in the city of Leuna.

The chemical industry of the German Democratic Republic is world-renowned. At present, its total output ranks seventh in the world, and if calculated per capita, the German Democratic Republic ranks second in the world.

The Socialist Unity Party and the government of the German Democratic Republic attach great importance to the development of the chemical industry. Since the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the development of the chemical industry has always been ahead of other industries. Compared with 1936, the output of the chemical industry of the German Democratic Republic is three times that of the same region of Germany at that time. In July of this year, the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany stipulated that during the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), emphasis should be placed on developing the chemical industry, increasing output by 60%, and requiring the chemical industry to overproduce products worth 1.9 billion marks in the last two years of the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960). The Party and the government have also decided to increase investment in the chemical industry and allocate a special batch of steel to help the chemical industry replace outdated equipment.

The German Democratic Republic is a country with relatively scarce natural resources, and many materials rely on the chemical industry to provide them. Chemical industrial products are used in an extremely wide range in the German Democratic Republic, which can replace metals, natural rubber, leather, and provide fertilizers and textile raw materials, etc. Even the sausage casings that residents eat every day are made of plastic.

Comrade Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Deputy Prime Minister, when talking about the importance of the chemical industry to the German Democratic Republic at the aforementioned chemical industry conference, listed five reasons: First, saving labor; second, wide application of mechanization and automation; third, rapid product production; fourth, saving raw materials, with almost no waste of raw materials; fifth, having connections with all industrial sectors, and developing the chemical industry can promote the development of other industries. From this, people can also understand the reasons why the Socialist Unity Party and the government of the German Democratic Republic attach importance to the development of the chemical industry.

The Socialist Unity Party and the government of the German Democratic Republic believe that among various chemical industries, the plastics industry and synthetic fiber industry are still relatively backward. Therefore, the Party and the government have decided to concentrate efforts on developing these two types of products during the Third Five-Year Plan. The goal is: to produce an average of seven kilograms of plastic per person by 1960, and sixteen kilograms per person by 1965. (Attached picture)

### 民主德国化学工业走在前面  产量按人口计算跃居世界第二位

    民主德国化学工业走在前面
    产量按人口计算跃居世界第二位
    据新华社柏林7日电　本社记者张辛民报道：“化学工业给我们面包，给我们繁荣，给我们美好的远景！”这是最近几天在洛伊纳城“乌布利希工厂”召开的德意志民主共和国第一次化学工业会议向民主德国人民提出的一个动人的口号。
    民主德国的化学工业是世界闻名的。目前，它的总产量居世界第七位，如按人口平均计算，民主德国则居世界第二位。
    民主德国党和政府非常重视化学工业的发展。自从民主德国立国以来，化学工业的发展一直走在其他工业的前面。同1936年相比，民主德国化学工业的产量三倍于当时德国同一地区的产量。今年7月，德国统一社会党第五次代表大会曾经规定在第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间着重发展化学工业，使产量增加60％，并且要求化学工业在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）的最后两年能够超额生产十九亿马克的产品。党和政府也决定增加对化学工业的投资，专门拨出一批钢材帮助化学工业更换陈旧的装备。
    民主德国是一个天然资源比较不够丰富的国家，许多物资都依靠化学工业来提供。化学工业产品在民主德国的应用范围极其广泛，它可以代替金属、天然橡胶、皮革、并且提供肥料和纺织原料等。甚至连居民每天吃的香肠的肠衣也都是用塑料制成的。
    德国统一社会党中央第一书记、第一副总理乌布利希同志在上述化学工业会议上谈到化学工业对民主德国的重要性时，曾列举了五项理由：第一，节省劳动力；第二，应用机械化和自动化的范围广；第三，产品生产迅速；第四，节省原材料，几乎一点原材料都不浪费；第五，同所有的工业部门都有联系，发展化学工业可以推动其他工业的发展。从这里人们也可以了解民主德国党和政府所以重视发展化学工业的原因。
    民主德国的党和政府认为在各种化学工业中，塑料工业和合成纤维工业还比较落后。因此，党和政府决定在第三个五年计划期间集中力量发展这两方面的产品。目标是：到1960年生产平均每人七公斤的塑料，1965年达到平均每人十六公斤。（附图片）
