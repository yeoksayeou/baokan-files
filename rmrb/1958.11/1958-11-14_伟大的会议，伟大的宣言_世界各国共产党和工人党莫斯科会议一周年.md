    Great Meeting, Great Declaration
    -- One Year Anniversary of the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries
    Yang Shangkun
    Editor's Note: It has been one year since the world's communist and workers' parties held a meeting of great historical significance in Moscow and issued an important declaration in November of last year. To commemorate this important event, we are reprinting an article written by Comrade Yang Shangkun for the third issue of the magazine "Problems of Peace and Socialism".

    In November of last year, at the initiative of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the communist and workers' parties of all countries held a meeting of great historical significance in Moscow, taking advantage of the opportunity to participate in the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    Since the dissolution of the Communist International, this was the most extensive international meeting of communist and workers' parties of all countries. This meeting reflected the upsurge of the international communist movement, strengthened the unity of the entire socialist camp and the international communist movement, and laid a new political and ideological foundation for this unity. At the same time, this meeting, by adopting a method of consultation to reach consensus, provided a good example of enhancing the unity of the international communist ranks on the basis of proletarian internationalism. The communist and workers' parties of all countries unanimously agreed that this meeting marked the beginning of a new stage in the international communist movement. (I)

    The greatest achievement of the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries was the adoption of two declarations of great historical significance, namely the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Declaration adopted by the Meeting of Representatives of Sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties.

    The Declaration of the Twelve Communist Parties (later endorsed by the communist and workers' parties of capitalist countries) is in fact a program for the international communist movement in the coming period. It summarizes the experience of the international communist movement over the past 100 years, especially the last 40 years, summarizes the experience of communist parties of all countries in the struggle for international peace and human progress, summarizes the experience of communist parties of countries that have seized power in carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, and also summarizes the experience of communist parties of countries that have not yet seized power in the struggle for democratic freedom, national liberation, and the socialist future of their countries. It defends the principles of Marxism-Leninism, clarifies many major political and theoretical issues that serve as the basis for the unity of the entire socialist camp and the international communist movement, such as the correct analysis of the current international situation, the basic tasks of the modern revolutionary workers' movement, the establishment of a united front in the struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism, the two possible ways for countries to transition from capitalism to socialism, the common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the interrelationship between the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and the national characteristics of each country, the use of dialectics and the strengthening of ideological work by communist parties in their practical work, the struggle against the main danger in the current international communist movement—modern revisionism, the interrelationship between socialist countries and communist parties in the modern conditions based on the principle of internationalism, and so on. There is no doubt that the Declaration of the Twelve Communist Parties, as an epoch-making programmatic international document, has made a great contribution to the ideological and practical development of the socialist camp and the international communist movement.

    The enthusiastic Peace Declaration adopted by the sixty-four communist parties demonstrated the clear stance of the communists on the current most pressing issue of war and peace. It pointed out the path to stopping war, issued a solemn call to all mankind to strive for peace, and showed the determination of the international proletariat and the people of all countries to unite and defend peace.

    The Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries and its declarations, by holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, clarified some ideological confusion in the international communist movement before and after the Hungarian counter-revolutionary incident, especially regarding the following three issues:

    First, on the issue of war and peace, the Declaration of the Twelve Communist Parties clearly pointed out that "as long as imperialism exists, there is soil for aggressive wars." The Peace Declaration also clearly pointed out that "monopoly capital groups that have made huge fortunes in the two world wars and in the current arms race are keen on war and fantasize about war." Both declarations also pointed out that the forces of peace have grown greatly and that it is practically possible to prevent war. The most powerful force for peace in the contemporary era is first and foremost the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Communist and workers' parties of all countries must regard the struggle for peace as their primary task. However, since the root cause of war is imperialism, whether mankind can avoid the disaster of another world war cannot depend solely on the good wishes of peace-loving people and their unilateral efforts. Moreover, imperialism, especially US imperialism, is to some extent using people's fear of atomic war—which is perfectly understandable—to try to intimidate the people of all countries and disarm them spiritually against war, so that it can carry out aggressive and war activities at will and impose aggression and war on the people. Therefore, all truly peace-loving people must never succumb to the threat of imperialist war, but must transform their fear of war into a dauntless spirit to struggle against imperialism. If imperialism, regardless of the opposition of the world's people, insists on provoking a new world war, then, as pointed out in the communiqué of the meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev on August 3 this year, "all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and people will unite closely, completely eliminate the imperialist aggressors, and lay the foundation for a lasting peace in the world."

    Second, on the issue of transition from capitalism to socialism, the declaration put forward two possible ways, peaceful and non-peaceful. The working class and its vanguard will "strive to achieve socialist revolution through peaceful means," but "under the condition that the exploiting classes use violence against the people, it is necessary to consider another possibility, that is, a non-peaceful transition to socialism." Which way a socialist revolution might take "depends not so much on the proletariat as on the extent to which the reactionary groups resist the will of the vast majority of the people, and on whether these groups resort to violence at this or that stage of the struggle for socialism." The declaration's presentation of these two possible ways firstly indicates that the working class and its vanguard in all countries are defensive on the issue of whether or not to use violence. The bourgeoisie will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history; this is a universal law of class struggle. Therefore, while making great efforts to realize the desire for a peaceful transition to socialism, the working class and its vanguard must be prepared at any time to rely on the broad masses of the people to meet the attacks of counter-revolution and smash any action by the reactionaries to use force to suppress the people's revolution. When the state apparatus is still in the hands of the exploiting classes, there is always the danger that the reactionaries may take measures such as dissolving parliament, amending the constitution, declaring elections invalid, declaring the communist party illegal, or even carrying out fascist military coups and launching civil wars to deal with the people's revolution.

    Third, on the great historical task of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the declaration states the common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and elucidates the principle that the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism must be combined with the practice of revolution and construction in each country. The common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction are objectively existing, have been pointed out by Marx and Lenin long ago, and have also been proved by the practice of revolution and construction in the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries. In order to realize socialism, it is first necessary for the working class, with the Marxist-Leninist party as its core, to lead the working masses to carry out proletarian revolution in one form or another, establish proletarian dictatorship in one form or another, and, through the proletarian dictatorship, carry out the socialist revolution economically, politically, and ideologically to the end. This common law is universally applicable to all countries that are on the path to socialism. However, due to the specific national characteristics of different countries, the forms of socialist revolution and socialist construction in each country must necessarily be diverse. This is a basic principle of Marxism-Leninism. Violating this principle, if one denies the common laws, one will fall into the mire of revisionism; conversely, if one does not give sufficient attention to the specific characteristics of each country and each nation, one will commit dogmatic errors.

    The Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries and its declarations have been endorsed by all Marxist-Leninist parties in the world, and have also been welcomed and supported by the broad masses of the people in all countries of the world. Only the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, claiming to be "communists" but not hesitating to stand outside the communist ranks, stubbornly opposes the Declaration of the Twelve Communist Parties, and also abandons the Peace Declaration that it signed. (II)

    The development of the world political situation in the past year has fully confirmed the correctness of the Moscow Declarations.

    Even at the time of the Moscow meeting, it was clear to people that the launch of two Soviet man-made satellites, coupled with the holding of the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries, showed that the development of the international situation in our era had reached a new turning point. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, the East wind is prevailing over the West wind. This means that the forces of peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism have already gained the upper hand over the imperialist forces. In particular, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union far surpasses the imperialist camp in terms of its large population, the popular support it enjoys, the speed of its economic development, and several important areas of science and technology.

    The characteristic of the development of the world situation in the past year is that "the East wind is blowing strongly and the West wind is weakening." As the Declaration of the Twelve Communist Parties states, "Socialism is developing upward, while imperialism is declining." Now, the economic and cultural construction of the socialist camp is developing forward at an unprecedented speed. The Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries have all seen the emergence of a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. This year, the Soviet Union has achieved new and great successes in the race to "overtake the United States." In the first half of this year, compared with the same period last year, the Soviet Union's industrial production increased by 10.5%, while the United States decreased by 10.8%. In the first half of this year, the Soviet Union's coal production has already surpassed that of the United States, and its steel production has reached 78.9% of that of the United States. This year, China is also making great strides in the race to "overtake Britain." In the first half of this year, compared with the same period last year, China's industrial production increased by 34%, while Britain decreased by 2.1%. The timetable for the Soviet Union to "overtake the United States" and China to "overtake Britain" has been greatly advanced. The national economies of the entire socialist camp are constantly rising, while the major capitalist countries, starting with the United States, have been engulfed in a new capitalist economic crisis. In terms of industrial production, in the first half of this year, compared with the same period last year, the socialist camp increased by an average of 13%, while the five countries of the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, and Japan decreased by an average of 4.6%. This sharp contrast in the peaceful competition vividly proves that the socialist system is far superior to capitalism. In the peaceful competition, the socialist camp will certainly leave the imperialist camp further and further behind.

    In the past year, the vigorous national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have also proved that, in the contemporary conditions where a powerful socialist camp exists, the national liberation movement has become an irresistible historical trend. The victory of the Iraqi national revolution has turned the reactionary fortress of imperialism into the outpost of the Arab people's struggle for national liberation overnight. Latin America, the so-called "backyard" of US imperialism, has now become the front line of the struggle against US imperialism. US imperialism, which is carrying out aggressive activities everywhere, has exposed itself as the number one enemy of all oppressed nations and all peace-loving people in the world. The forces of socialism and the forces of the national liberation movement are standing on a common front against imperialism. In the struggle to win and defend national independence, all oppressed nations, as long as they unite all patriotic and democratic forces internally and unite with socialist countries externally, will certainly be able to defeat imperialist aggression and oppression.

    In the major capitalist countries, the democratic movements to strive for peace, defend democracy, demand social change, and defend the rights of working people have also made new developments in the past year. In countries such as France, Italy, and Japan, the increasingly united working class and all working people are fighting with growing fighting spirit to strive for the realization of the rights and demands of working people, and resolutely oppose all the consequences brought about by imperialist policies. In countries such as the United States, Britain, and Canada, the broad masses of workers are holding continuous strikes to oppose the transfer of the serious burdens of the economic crisis by monopoly capital. These monopoly capital groups, such as the French monopoly capital group, are attempting to adopt methods of fascist dictatorship to find a way out of the political and economic crisis, and are actively preparing to carry out fascist attacks on freedom-loving people. However, this kind of reactionary attack can only lead to its own opposite, mobilizing all social strata oppressed by monopoly capital to oppose them themselves to a greater and deeper extent.

    In the past year, the world peace movement has also developed to a greater extent both in breadth and depth. It is developing into the broadest social strata of various countries, and has obtained the approval of certain government figures in some capitalist countries. In particular, the people of all countries who are fighting to win and defend national independence, participating in the peace movement with an anti-colonialist fighting stance, has greatly strengthened the momentum of the world peace movement. In Japan, West Germany, Britain, and many other capitalist countries, the movement to demand the prohibition of the testing and use of nuclear weapons has become a mass movement with broad participation. The calls for universal disarmament, for the prohibition of the testing and use of nuclear weapons, for the establishment of collective security in Europe and Asia, for the realization of peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems, and for the adoption of consultative methods to peacefully resolve international disputes have resonated throughout the world.

    In the past year, although the world's people's struggle to defend peace has achieved great victories, the people of the whole world must continue to maintain the greatest vigilance against the danger of war caused by the imperialist camp headed by the United States. Defending world peace and opposing the danger of a new war remains the basic task of the world's people at present. US imperialism is now the main instigator of war. It has gathered all reactionary forces around itself and has become the center of reactionary forces throughout the world. While the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, together with all peace-loving countries and people, are making great efforts to consolidate peace, US imperialism stubbornly refuses to stop its activities of aggression and war. In particular, when the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries are striving to win and defend their national independence, US imperialism is stepping up its interference in the internal affairs of these countries, and is openly carrying out military aggression and military threats against these countries. Not long ago, the United States colluded with Britain to carry out military aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and recently the United States has been carrying out military threats and war provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area. But what will be the result of this aggressive policy and war policy of US imperialism? Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in a recent speech: "China's territory Taiwan, Lebanon, and all US military bases in foreign countries are all nooses around the neck of US imperialism. It is not others but the Americans themselves who made this noose and put it around their own necks, and handed the other end of the noose to the Chinese people, the people of Arab countries, and all peace-loving and anti-aggression people in the world. The longer the US aggressors stay in these places, the tighter the noose around their necks will become." "If the US monopoly capital group insists on pursuing its aggressive policy and war policy, it will inevitably be sentenced to hanging by the people of the world one day." US imperialism insists on creating tension, but is it really always beneficial to it? Comrade Mao Zedong also answered: "These tensions created by the United States have gone against the wishes of the Americans, and have played a role in mobilizing the people of the world to rise up against the US aggressors."

    All this shows that the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries and its declarations, with its fighting program for peace, democracy, and socialism, are mobilizing, inspiring, and attracting more and more broad masses of the people around the world. (III)

    In the year since the Moscow Meeting, the work and struggle of the communist and workers' parties in various countries have made new achievements, and the development of the entire international communist movement has become even more vigorous and shows broad prospects.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has made brilliant achievements in leading the Soviet people in carrying out communist construction, has made great contributions to further enhancing the power of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, and has also played a decisive role in the unremitting struggle of uniting all peace-loving forces in the world to consolidate peace and stop the danger of war. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is actively preparing to convene the Twenty-First Congress, proposing a magnificent seven-year plan for building communism. The unwavering prestige of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union among the working people of the world has therefore increased even more.

    The Communist Party of China has achieved basic victories in leading the Chinese people in carrying out socialist revolution on the political front and the ideological front. On the basis of summarizing the experience of eight years of socialist construction, the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held in May this year, formulated the general line for China's socialist construction. Under the mobilization and encouragement of this general line, a climax of the great liberation of communist ideology is being set off among the Chinese people, creating a very magnificent situation of a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and a great development of people's communes.

    New climaxes in the economy, politics, and ideology have appeared in other socialist fraternal countries in Asia and Europe under the leaderships of the fraternal parties. The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Eleventh Congress of the Czechoslovakian Communist Party, and the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held successively from June to July this year, all demonstrated the unity and unanimity of their party ranks and the determination to build socialism as soon as possible.

    The communist parties in Asian, African, and Latin American countries are all standing on the forefront of the struggle to win and defend their national independence, and are increasingly becoming the core of inspiring and uniting all patriotic and democratic forces in this struggle. In many countries, a united front for national liberation has been formed, and the influence of the communist party in the united front is growing. The communist parties in many countries have achieved legal status because of the development of the national liberation movement. The prestige of the communist parties in Indonesia, India, Algeria, Iraq, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia, Cuba, and other countries among the masses of their own people is constantly increasing.

    The communist parties in capitalist countries have made new progress in the struggle against revisionism and right-wing traitors, in defending the Marxist-Leninist unity of the party, in strengthening the party's unity and enhancing the party's combat effectiveness, and in establishing close ties with workers, peasants, and other working masses and uniting all democratic and progressive forces. The French Communist Party is uniting all forces in the country who support the republican system to carry out the arduous struggle against de Gaulle's "dictatorial constitution." The Italian Communist Party achieved a brilliant victory in the general election in May this year. The Finnish Communist Party and its allies also won the position of the largest party in the parliamentary elections. The Communist Party of the United States, which has been severely persecuted by the reactionaries and is struggling under the most difficult conditions, has also restored and improved its combat effectiveness after clearing out revisionists such as the bourgeois agent Gates.

    During the period before and after the Hungarian incident, a cloud appeared over the international communist movement, and anti-communist waves came one after another. Imperialists and reactionaries in various countries tried to weaken the communist party and prevent the growth of the communist party's power by means of terror, subversion, persecution, and slander. Revisionist elements carrying out divisive activities within the communist ranks also became rampant, responding to the attacks of imperialists and reactionaries in various countries against the international communist movement. However, bad things turned into good things: both the attacks of imperialists and reactionaries and the divisive activities of revisionist elements only tempered the communist ranks. After clearing out revisionist elements, opportunists, and wavering elements, the communist parties in various countries have not weakened but have become more consolidated.

    The determination of the Declaration of the Twelve Communist Parties that modern revisionism is the main danger to the current international communist movement has been confirmed by facts, The "Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia" adopted by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in April this year is the most concentrated representation of this modern revisionism. This thoroughly revisionist program proves that the Yugoslav leadership group has politically and ideologically degenerated into traitors to the working class. This is a logical result of their implementation of a policy of flattery towards the United States and opposition to the Soviet Union in foreign affairs, and a policy of abandoning the struggle between the two roads and allowing the free proliferation of capitalist production relations and ideologies and the American way of life in domestic affairs. Revisionism is a bourgeois ideology, and Yugoslav revisionism is even more a product of the policies of imperialism, especially US imperialism. Adapting to the needs of US imperialism, the Yugoslav leadership group vainly attempted to establish a revisionist banner within the international communist movement, in order to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement. However, they did not know that by doing so, they completely exposed their faces as modern revisionists who are willing to serve imperialism. In the struggle against Yugoslav revisionism, all Marxist-Leninist parties in the world are unanimous, and have criticized and condemned the Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, thereby bankrupting the conspiracy of the Yugoslav revisionists.

    In the past year, facts have proved that, contrary to the expectations of imperialists and revisionists, although the international communist movement still has many difficulties and weaknesses, the international communist movement has not retreated but has developed better forward. (IV)

    Communist and workers' parties of all countries are facing great historical tasks. In order to realize these tasks, there is a need for the rock-solid unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement. This unity is the core of all broader popular unity, and is the most fundamental guarantee of the victory of the common cause of the working classes of all countries.

    Imperialists and all those who oppose communism hope that our communist ranks will be as scattered and as disunited as possible. However, we are fighting communist ranks, and our ranks must have political, ideological, and action unity. Since Marx, it has been required that the proletarians of the world unite, otherwise they will not have the strength to fight against the enemy and will be defeated by the enemy one by one.

    Unity must have a center. The unity of the socialist camp must be centered on the Soviet Union. The unity of the international communist movement must be centered on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's position as the center of this unity was not artificially created by anyone, but was naturally formed by historical conditions.

    The unity of our communist ranks is not unprincipled unity, but must be unity based on Marxism-Leninism. Only on the basis of Marxism-Leninism can we find a common language in our communist ranks. And the Moscow Declarations are precisely the criteria for the common language of our communist ranks.

    The basis of the mutual relations between our socialist countries and between the communist parties of various countries is proletarian internationalism. Proletarian internationalism includes the principle of national equality. The essence of the mutual relations between our socialist countries and between the communist parties of various countries, in addition to the need to fully abide by the principle of national equality, also includes the lofty obligation to mutually assist and unite in cooperation in the common cause.

    In the year since the Moscow Meeting, the unity between our socialist countries and between the communist parties of various countries has made important progress, whether in the common struggle for peace and socialism, in defending the ideological front of Marxism-Leninism, or in mutually learning from each other and exchanging experiences in all exchanges. Undoubtedly, in the current situation, all sincere communists must especially cherish unity, actively strive to strengthen proletarian international solidarity, and resolutely oppose any remarks and actions that harm unity.

    The great Moscow Meeting and the Moscow Declarations illuminate our path forward with its brilliance. We believe that the unity of the entire socialist camp and the international communist movement, taking the Moscow Meeting and the Moscow Declarations as a new starting point, will definitely exert a powerful, truly endless force, and win one greater and continuous victory after another for the common cause of the international proletariat.

    伟大的会议，伟大的宣言
    ——世界各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议一周年
    杨尚昆
    编者按　世界各国共产党和工人党去年11月间在莫斯科举行具有伟大历史意义的会议和发表重要的宣言，已届一周年。我们为了纪念这一重大的事件，特转载了杨尚昆同志为“和平和社会主义问题”杂志第三期撰写的文章。
    去年11月间，世界各国共产党和工人党，在苏联共产党的创议下，曾经趁着参加庆祝十月革命四十周年的时机，在莫斯科举行了具有伟大历史意义的代表会议。
    自从共产国际解散以来，这还是世界各国共产党和工人党的一次最广泛的国际会议。这次会议反映了国际共产主义运动的高涨，加强了整个社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，并且为这种团结奠定了新的政治和思想的基础。同时，这次会议由于采取协商方法而达到了意见的一致，提供了在无产阶级国际主义基础上增强国际共产主义队伍的团结的良好范例。世界各国共产党和工人党一致认为，这次会议开始了国际共产主义运动的新阶段。（一）
    各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的最大成就就是通过了两个具有伟大历史意义的宣言，即社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和六十四个共产党和工人党代表会议通过的和平宣言。
    十二国共产党宣言（以后又为资本主义国家共产党和工人党所赞同的）实际上是今后一个时期内国际共产主义运动的纲领。它总结了一百年来特别是近四十年来国际共产主义运动的经验，总结了世界各国共产党为争取国际和平和人类进步而斗争的经验，总结了已经取得政权的各国共产党为进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设而斗争的经验，也总结了尚未取得政权的各国共产党为争取民主自由、民族解放和本国社会主义前途而斗争的经验。它保卫了马克思列宁主义的原则，阐明了作为整个社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结基础的许多重大的政治和理论的问题，诸如对当前国际形势的正确分析问题，现代革命工人运动的基本任务问题，在争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的斗争中建立统一战线问题，各国从资本主义向社会主义过渡的两种可能的方式问题，社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律问题，马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和各国民族特点的相互关系问题，各国共产党在实际工作中运用辩证法和加强思想工作的问题，同当前国际共产主义运动中的主要危险——现代修正主义作斗争的问题，现代条件下各社会主义国家之间和各国共产党之间以国际主义原则为基础的相互关系问题等等。毫无疑问，十二国共产党宣言作为一个划时代的纲领性的国际文件，为此后社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动在思想和实践方面的发展作出了伟大的贡献。
    六十四个共产党所通过的热情洋溢的和平宣言，在战争和和平这个当前最迫切的问题上表明了共产党人的鲜明立场。它指明了制止战争的道路，向全人类发出了争取和平的庄严号召，显示了国际无产阶级和世界各国人民团结一致维护和平的决心。
    世界各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议及其宣言，由于高举马克思列宁主义的大旗，澄清了匈牙利反革命事件前后国际共产主义运动中的某些思想混乱，特别是关于下面三个问题：
    一、在战争与和平问题上，十二国共产党宣言明确地指出：“只要帝国主义还存在，就有发生侵略战争的土壤”。和平宣言也明确地指出，“热衷于战争和幻想战争的是在两次世界大战中、在目前的军备竞赛中大发横财的垄断资本集团”。两个宣言同时指出，和平力量已经大大成长，已经有实际可能来防止战争。当代最强大的和平力量，首先就是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营。各国共产党和工人党必须把争取和平的斗争当做自己的首要任务。但是，既然战争的根源是帝国主义，那末，人类能否避免另一次世界大战的灾难，就不能仅仅取决于爱好和平人民的善良愿望和他们单方面的努力。而且帝国主义特别是美帝国主义在某种程度上正在利用人们对于原子战争的恐惧心理——这种恐惧心理是完全可以理解的，来企图吓倒各国人民，解除各国人民反对战争的精神武装，以便它为所欲为地进行侵略和战争活动，把侵略和战争强加在人民头上。因此，一切真正爱好和平的人民绝不能在帝国主义战争威胁面前屈服，而必须把对战争的恐惧心理转化为同帝国主义进行斗争的大无畏精神。假如帝国主义悍然不顾世界人民的反对，硬要挑起新的世界战争，那末，正如今年8月3日毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫会谈公报中所指出的，“所有爱好和平和爱好自由的国家和人民必将紧密地团结在一起，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的永久和平。”
    二、在从资本主义向社会主义过渡的问题上，宣言提出了和平和非和平两种可能的方式。工人阶级及其先锋队将“力图通过和平的方式实现社会主义革命”，但是“在剥削阶级对人民使用暴力的条件下，就必须考虑另外一种可能，即非和平地过渡到社会主义”。社会主义革命究竟可能采取那种方式，“与其说是决定于无产阶级，不如说是决定于反动集团对于绝大多数人民的意志抵抗到甚么程度，决定于在争取社会主义斗争的这一或那一阶段上这些集团是不是采取暴力。”宣言提出这两种可能的方式，首先表明各国工人阶级及其先锋队在是否使用暴力问题上是防御的。资产阶级不会自动退出历史舞台，这是阶级斗争的普遍规律。因此，工人阶级及其先锋队在为着实现和平过渡到社会主义的愿望而作重大努力的时候，必须随时准备依靠广大人民群众迎击反革命的袭击，粉碎反动派使用武力来镇压人民革命的任何行动。在国家机器还掌握在剥削阶级手里的时候，反动派可以随时根据需要，采取解散议会、修改宪法、宣布选举无效、宣布共产党非法、直到实行法西斯军事政变和发动内战等手段来对付人民革命这种危险总是存在的。
    三、在社会主义革命和社会主义建设这个伟大的历史任务问题上，宣言陈述了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律，并且阐明了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理必须同各国革命和建设的实践相结合的原则。社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律是客观存在的，是马克思和列宁早就指出了的，也是苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的革命和建设的实践所证明了的。为了实现社会主义，首先要求以马克思列宁主义政党为核心的工人阶级领导劳动群众进行这种形式或那种形式的无产阶级革命，建立这种形式或那种形式的无产阶级专政，通过无产阶级专政把经济上、政治上和思想上的社会主义革命进行到底。这个共同规律是普遍适用于各个走向社会主义道路的国家的。但是，由于不同国家的具体民族特点，各国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的形式又必然是多种多样的。这是马克思列宁主义的一项基本原理。违背这个原理，如果否认共同规律就会陷入修正主义泥坑，反之，如果不充分重视各国和各民族的具体特点就要犯教条主义错误。
    世界各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议及其宣言，得到了全世界一切马克思列宁主义政党的赞同，也得到了世界各国广大人民群众的欢迎和拥护。只有南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团，以“共产党人”自居而又不惜自外于共产主义队伍，顽固地对抗十二国共产党宣言，并且也背弃了自己签了字的和平宣言。（二）
    一年来，世界政治形势的发展完全证实了莫斯科宣言的正确性。
  还在莫斯科会议的当时，人们就清楚地看到，苏联两颗人造卫星上天，加上世界各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的召开，显示出我们这个时代国际形势的发展达到一个新的转折点。正如毛泽东同志所说，现在是东风压倒西风。这就是说，和平的、民主的、民族独立的和社会主义的力量已经对帝国主义力量占了优势。特别是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，在人口众多、人心归向、经济发展速度以及若干重要的科学技术等方面都远远地超过了帝国主义阵营。
    一年来世界形势发展的特点就是“东风劲吹西风衰”。正如十二国共产党宣言所说，“社会主义在向上发展，而帝国主义却在衰退”。现在，社会主义阵营的经济建设和文化建设正在以空前的速度向前发展。苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家都出现了工农业生产大跃进的形势。今年，苏联在“超美”的竞赛中已经获得新的巨大的成就。今年上半年和去年同期比较，苏联的工业生产增长了10.5％，而美国下降了10.8％。今年上半年，苏联的煤产量已经超过美国，钢产量已经达到美国的78.9％。今年，中国在“超英”的竞赛中也在大踏步地前进。今年上半年和去年同期比较，中国的工业生产增长了34％，而英国下降了2.1％。苏联“超美”和中国“超英”的时间表都大大地提前了。整个社会主义阵营的国民经济都在不断高涨，而主要资本主义国家由美国开始都卷入了新的资本主义经济危机。以工业生产而论，今年上半年和去年同期比较，社会主义阵营平均增长了13％，而美、英、法、西德、日本五个国家平均下降了4.6％。这个和平竞赛方面的鲜明对比，生动地证明了社会主义制度远比资本主义优胜。在和平竞赛中，社会主义阵营一定将把帝国主义阵营越来越远地抛在自己的后面。
    一年来，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲如火如荼的民族解放运动也证明，在存在着强大的社会主义阵营的当代条件下，民族解放运动已经成为不可抗拒的历史潮流。伊拉克民族革命的胜利，在一昼夜之间就把帝国主义的反动堡垒变成阿拉伯人民民族解放斗争的前哨。拉丁美洲这个所谓美帝国主义的“后院”，现在也变成了反对美帝国主义的斗争的前线。到处进行侵略活动的美帝国主义，已在全世界人民面前暴露了它是一切被压迫民族和一切爱好和平人民的头号敌人。社会主义的力量和民族解放运动的力量是站在一条反对帝国主义的共同战线上的。在争取和维护民族独立的斗争中，一切被压迫民族只要对内团结一切爱国民主力量，对外联合社会主义国家，就一定能够战胜帝国主义的侵略和压迫。
    在主要资本主义国家，争取和平、保卫民主、要求实现社会变革和维护劳动人民权利的民主运动，一年来也有了新的发展。在法国、意大利和日本等国，越来越团结的工人阶级和全体劳动者，都在以日益增长的战斗精神，为争取实现劳动人民的权利和要求而斗争，坚决反对帝国主义政策所带来的一切后果。在美国、英国和加拿大等国，广大工人群众为反对垄断资本转嫁经济危机的严重负担而举行着连续不断的罢工。这些垄断资本集团，例如法国垄断资本集团，正在企图采取法西斯独裁统治的办法来寻找摆脱政治和经济危机的出路，积极准备对爱好自由的人民进行法西斯的袭击。但是，这种反动的袭击只能走向自己的反面，在更广大和更深刻的程度上调动一切受垄断资本压迫的社会阶层起来反对它们自己。
    一年来，世界保卫和平运动无论在广度上和深度上也都有了更大的发展。它正在向各国最广大的社会阶层中发展，并且在某些资本主义国家中取得某些政府人士的赞同。特别是为争取和维护民族独立而斗争的各国人民，以反殖民主义的战斗姿态参加到和平运动里来，更是大大地壮大了世界和平运动的声势。在日本、西德、英国以及其他许多资本主义国家，要求禁止试验和使用核子武器的运动已经成为广大群众性的运动。要求普遍裁减军备、要求禁止试验和使用核子武器、要求建立欧洲和亚洲的集体安全、要求实现不同社会制度国家的和平共处、要求采取协商方法和平解决国际争端的呼声响遍了全世界。
    一年来，世界人民保卫和平的斗争虽然取得了巨大的胜利，但是，全世界人民对于以美国为首的帝国主义阵营所造成的战争危险还必须继续保持最大的警惕。保卫世界和平，反对新战争危险，仍然是全世界人民当前的基本任务。美帝国主义现在是战争的主要策动者。它把全世界一切反动势力都集合在自己周围，成为全世界反动势力的中心。当苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家同一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起对巩固和平作着重大努力的时候，美帝国主义却顽固地拒绝停止它的侵略和战争的活动。特别是当亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民努力争取和维护自己民族独立的时候，美帝国主义却加紧干涉这些国家内政，并且公然对这些国家实行武力侵略和武力威胁。不久以前，美国纠合英国对黎巴嫩和约旦实行了武力侵略，最近美国又在台湾海峡地区对中国人民进行武力威胁和战争挑衅。但是，美帝国主义这种侵略政策和战争政策会有甚么结果呢？毛泽东同志在最近的一次讲话中指出：“中国领土台湾、黎巴嫩以及所有美国在外国的军事基地，都是套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索。不是别人而是美国人自己制造这种绞索，并把它套在自己的脖子上，而把绞索的另一端交给了中国人民、阿拉伯各国人民和全世界一切爱和平反侵略的人民。美国侵略者在这些地方停留得越久，套在它的头上的绞索就将越紧。”“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。”美帝国主义硬要制造紧张局势，难道紧张局势果真总是对它有利吗？毛泽东同志也作了回答：“美国制造的这些紧张局势走向了美国人愿望的反面，它起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用。”
    这一切说明，各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议及其宣言，正在以它的争取和平、民主和社会主义的战斗纲领在全世界范围内动员着、鼓舞着和吸引着越来越多的广大人民群众。（三）
    从莫斯科会议以来一年间，各国共产党和工人党的工作和斗争都有了新的成就，整个国际共产主义运动的发展也更加蓬蓬勃勃而展现着广阔的前景。
    苏联共产党在领导苏联人民进行共产主义建设方面取得了辉煌成就，在进一步提高苏联和整个社会主义阵营的威力方面作出了重大贡献，在团结世界一切爱好和平的力量为巩固和平和制止战争危险而进行的不懈斗争中也发挥了决定性作用。苏联共产党正在积极准备召开第二十一次代表大会，提出建设共产主义的宏伟的七年计划。苏联共产党在世界劳动人民中的不可动摇的威信已因此而更加增长了。
    中国共产党在领导中国人民进行政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命方面取得了基本胜利。在总结八年社会主义建设的经验的基础上，今年5月间举行的中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第二次会议制订了关于中国社会主义建设的总路线。在这条总路线的动员和鼓舞之下，中国人民中正在掀起一个共产主义思想大解放的高潮，造成一个工农业生产大跃进和人民公社大发展的十分壮丽的局面。
    亚洲和欧洲其他社会主义兄弟国家在兄弟党的领导下都出现了经济、政治和思想的新的高潮。今年6月间至7月间先后举行的保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会、捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会和德国统一社会党第五次代表大会都表现了他们党的队伍的团结一致和尽快建设社会主义的决心。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的共产党，无不站在争取和维护本国民族独立斗争的最前线，并且日益成为在这个斗争中鼓舞和团结一切爱国民主力量的核心。在许多国家中已经形成民族解放的统一战线，共产党在统一战线中的影响正在日益扩大。许多国家的共产党已因为民族解放运动的发展而取得合法地位。印度尼西亚、印度、阿尔及利亚、伊拉克、巴西、阿根廷、智利、委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、古巴等国共产党在本国人民群众中的威信都在不断地增长。
    资本主义国家的共产党，在反对修正主义和右派叛徒、保卫党的马克思列宁主义的统一的斗争中，在增强党的团结和提高党的战斗力的工作中，在同工人、农民和其他劳动群众建立亲密联系和团结一切民主进步力量的工作中都有了新的进展。法国共产党正在团结本国一切拥护共和制度的力量进行反对戴高乐“独裁宪法”的艰巨斗争。意大利共产党在今年5月的大选中取得了辉煌的胜利。芬兰共产党及其盟友也在国会选举中取得了第一大党的地位。受到反动派严重迫害、在最艰苦条件下进行斗争的美国共产党，在清除了资产阶级代理人盖茨等修正主义分子之后也恢复和提高了战斗力。
    在匈牙利事件前后的一个时期中，国际共产主义运动的上空出现了一片乌云，反共浪潮一个接着一个。帝国主义和各国反动派力图用恐怖、颠覆、迫害和诽谤来削弱共产党，阻止共产党力量的增长。在共产主义队伍里进行分裂活动的修正主义分子也猖獗起来，响应帝国主义和各国反动派对国际共产主义运动的进攻。然而，坏事变成好事：帝国主义和反动派的进攻也好，修正主义分子的分裂活动也好，都只是锻炼了共产主义的队伍。各国共产党在清除了修正主义分子、投机分子和不坚定分子之后，不是削弱而是更加巩固了。
    十二国共产党宣言关于现代修正主义是当前国际共产主义运动的主要危险的断定已为事实所证实。今年4月间南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会所通过的“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领”就是这种现代修正主义最集中的代表。这个彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领证明，南斯拉夫领导集团已经在政治上和思想上堕落成为工人阶级叛徒。这是他们对外实行一种媚美反苏政策、对内实行一种放弃两条道路斗争而允许资本主义生产关系和思想意识以及美国生活方式自由泛滥政策的合乎逻辑的结果。修正主义是一种资产阶级思潮，而南斯拉夫修正主义更是帝国主义特别是美帝国主义政策的产物。适应着美帝国主义的需要，南斯拉夫领导集团妄想在国际共产主义运动内部树立一面修正主义的旗帜，借以破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结。殊不知他们这样做，反而把他们作为现代修正主义者而甘心为帝国主义效劳的面目完全暴露出来了。在反对南斯拉夫修正主义的斗争中，全世界一切马克思列宁主义政党都是一致的，都对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领进行了批判和谴责，从而使南斯拉夫修正主义者的阴谋归于破产。
    一年来，事实证明，同帝国主义者和修正主义者的预料相反，国际共产主义运动尽管还有许多困难和弱点，但是国际共产主义运动不是后退了，而是更好地向前发展了。（四）
    各国共产党和工人党面临着伟大的历史任务。为着实现这些任务，就需要有社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的坚如磐石的团结。这种团结是一切更广泛的人民团结的核心，是各国工人阶级共同事业的胜利的最根本的保证。
    帝国主义者和一切反对共产主义的人，都希望我们共产主义队伍越分散越好，越不团结越好。但是，我们是战斗的共产主义队伍，我们这个队伍必须有政治上、思想上和行动上的团结一致。从马克思以来，就要求全世界无产者联合起来，否则就没有力量同敌人作斗争，就要被敌人各个击破。
    团结必须有一个中心。社会主义阵营的团结必须以苏联为中心。国际共产主义运动的团结必须以苏联共产党为中心。苏联这种团结中心的地位，不是任何人人为地造成的，而是历史条件所自然形成的。
    我们共产主义队伍的团结不是无原则的团结，而必须是以马克思列宁主义为基础的团结。只有在马克思列宁主义基础上才能找到我们共产主义队伍的共同语言。而莫斯科宣言正是我们共产主义队伍的共同语言的准则。
    我们社会主义各国之间和各国共产党之间相互关系的基础是无产阶级国际主义。无产阶级国际主义包括了民族平等的原则。我们社会主义各国之间和各国共产党之间相互关系的实质，除了必须充分遵守民族平等原则之外，还有在共同事业中互相援助和团结合作的崇高义务。
    从莫斯科会议以来一年间，我们社会主义各国和各国共产党之间的团结，无论在争取和平和社会主义的共同斗争方面，在保卫马克思列宁主义的思想战线方面，在一切交往中互相学习、交流经验方面，都有了重要的进展。无疑地，在目前情况下，一切真诚的共产主义者尤其要特别珍视团结，为着加强无产阶级国际团结而积极努力，坚决反对任何危害团结的言论和行动。
    伟大的莫斯科会议和莫斯科宣言用它的光芒照耀着我们前进的道路。我们相信，以莫斯科会议和莫斯科宣言为新的起点的整个社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，必将发挥出强大的真正无穷无尽的力量，为国际无产阶级的共同事业赢得一个比一个更大的不断的胜利。
