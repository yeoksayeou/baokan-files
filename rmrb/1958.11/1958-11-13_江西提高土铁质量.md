Jiangxi Improves Quality of Local Iron

(Our report) The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, from the very beginning of the mass campaign to produce steel, emphasized improving the quality of local iron, putting forward the comprehensive requirement of "fast iron production, high iron production, and good iron production."

To this end, the Provincial Committee and Party committees at all levels have taken a series of measures. First, they trained furnace workers to improve their operating skills. More than 20,000 technical workers have been trained throughout the province. Second, they dispatched more than 400 chemical analysis technicians to go deep into the furnace groups to help various localities cultivate chemical analysis capabilities and establish a chemical analysis system. Third, they frequently held on-site meetings to exchange experiences and improve technology. Fourth, they consolidated and improved small local furnace groups, carrying out the "five fixings" work of fixing furnaces, locations, groups, personnel, and leadership. At the same time, the broad masses of people launched technical innovations in the "comparing output and comparing quality" competition, effectively improving the quality of local iron. The Hongqi Iron Plant in Yange Township, Yongxin County, initially produced iron with slag on the surface and many pores, resulting in poor quality. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the iron plant formed a seven-person technical research team composed of cadres, local masters, and workers. With this team as the core, a movement to find the reasons, think of solutions, summarize experiences, and boldly innovate was launched throughout the plant. As a result, they found the key to improving the quality of local iron, making the molten iron flow smoothly without obstruction and with less slag, thereby increasing the purity of the iron. When the Henglu Iron Smelting Plant in Leping initially used lime kilns to smolder iron, the quality was poor. The plant's employees conducted comparative tests using six types of furnaces and various methods of batching, loading, ore selection, and ventilation. As a result, they learned a set of experiences to improve the quality of smoldered iron, making the quality of smoldered iron jump to the top in the county. The No. 2 Iron Smelting Plant in Guxiandu Township, Boyang County, originally had very poor quality in several iron smelting attempts. The plant's employees summarized their failure experiences and boldly innovated the iron smelting technology, creating a method of "underground iron smelting furnace," which could smelt more than 230 kilograms of pure iron in one kiln.

    江西提高土铁质量
    本报讯　中共江西省委在全民办钢铁的开始就强调提高土铁质量，提出了“出铁快、出铁多、出铁好”的全面要求。
    为此，省委及各级党委曾采取一系列措施。一、集训炉前工，提高操作技术，全省先后共训练了二万多名技术工人。二、抽调了四百多个化验技术人员深入炉群，帮助各地培养化验力量，建立了化验制度。三、经常召开现场会议，交流经验，改进技术。四、巩固和提高小土群，进行了定炉、定点、定组、定员、定领导的五定工作。与此同时，广大群众在“比产量、比质量”的竞赛中展开技术革新，有效地提高了土铁质量。永新县烟阁乡红旗铁厂，起初炼出来的铁表面有渣子，泡孔多，质量不高。在党支部领导下，这个铁厂就由干部、土师傅、工人等组成一个七人技术研究小组，以它为核心在全厂展开了找原因、想办法、总结经验、大胆革新的运动，结果找到了提高土铁质量的门路，使铁水长流无阻，带渣少，使铁的纯度增高。乐平横路炼铁厂开始用石灰窑焖铁时，质量不好。厂里职工用六种炉型和多种配料、装窑、选矿、通风方法进行对比试验，结果从中摸出了一套提高焖铁质量的经验，使焖铁质量跃居全县首位。波阳县古县渡乡第二炼铁厂原来几次焖铁质量都很差，全厂职工总结失败经验，大胆革新焖铁技术，创造了“地下焖铁炉”的办法，一窑能炼出纯铁二百三十多斤。
