    Lianjiang Uses Steam Hulls to Cook Rice
    (Reported by our newspaper) Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, is promoting the steam rice cooking method of the Red Flag Canteen in Aofeng People's Commune.
    According to the two-month practice of the Red Flag Canteen, it proves to have five major benefits: First, it saves firewood. The Red Flag Canteen uses steam to cook rice, consuming 480 jin of firewood for 500 jin of rice, using less than one jin of firewood per jin of rice. The Fengwei Canteen uses the old method to cook rice, consuming 1100 jin of firewood for 600 jin of rice, requiring 1.14 jin of firewood per jin of rice. Second, it saves expenses. The Red Flag Canteen consumes 800 jin of rice per day, and using steam saves 16 yuan in various expenses compared to the old method, saving more than 5800 yuan per year. Third, it saves labor. Before steam rice cooking, the Red Flag Canteen used three stoves for cooking rice, requiring six people including water carriers. After using steam rice cooking, it was combined into one large stove, requiring only three people to cook rice. Fourth, it saves time. For the same meal, the Red Flag Canteen took 1 hour and 26 minutes to cook, while the Fengwei Canteen took 2 hours and 14 minutes. Fifth, it keeps the rice warm for a longer time. Using stewing pots to cook rice can only keep it warm for 1.5 hours after the fire is extinguished. Using steam can keep it warm for three hours.
    This method was forced out when small canteens were merged into large canteens. In mid-August, they were a small canteen of twenty-one households, cooking collectively and eating separately. Due to production needs, commune members requested to merge the canteens, and the Party branch decided to merge six canteens into one large canteen. The cadres calculated at the time that merging the canteens, buying rice pots, and purchasing steaming baskets would cost at least 100 yuan, and many people were afraid to merge. The cadre Zheng Yilu tried every possible way, running around, and met Zhu Houxiang, who had seen steam boilers in Fuzhou in 1955. He thought: If steam can cook beans, it must also be able to cook rice, so he proposed using steam to cook rice. Yilu made a steam hull, installed two soup hulls on an ordinary stove pot, made a lid for the hull surface, used bamboo pipes to replace seamless steel pipes, connected the two hulls to steam pipes, and then installed a steam pipe to the steam hull, put rice pots in the hull, and it was successful on the first try. The entire equipment only cost 18 yuan. Currently, 481 public canteens in the county have been built or are being built with steam stoves.

### 连江用蒸汽楻炊饭

    连江用蒸汽楻炊饭
    本报讯　福建连江县正在推广敖峰人民公社红旗食堂蒸汽炊饭的办法。
    根据红旗食堂两月来的实践，证明它有五大好处：一、节省柴火。红旗食堂用蒸汽炊饭，五百斤米烧了四百八十斤柴火，一斤米还用不到一斤柴火。凤尾食堂用老办法炊饭，六百斤米烧了一千一百斤柴火，每斤米要烧一斤十四两柴火。二、节省开支，红旗食堂每天吃米八百斤，用蒸汽比老办法每天可节省各项开销十六元，全年可节省五千八百多元。三、节省人力。没有蒸汽炊饭时，红旗食堂三个灶煮饭，连挑水要用六个人。用蒸汽炊饭后，并为一个大灶，只用三个人煮饭。四、节省时间。同样一顿饭，红旗食堂炊了一点二十六分钟，凤尾食堂炊了二点十四分钟。五、保热时间长。用炖罐炊饭，熄火后只能保热一点半钟。用蒸汽炊能保热三小时。
    这办法是在小食堂并大食堂时逼出来的。8月半，他们是个二十一户的小食堂，集中煮、分户吃。由于生产需要，社员们要求并食堂，党支部就决定把六个食堂并为一个大食堂。干部当时算了账，要是并食堂，买饭罐，置炊笼，起马得一百元，好多人都不敢并。干部郑依禄到处想办法，跑来跑去，碰到了朱厚相，他1955年在福州看见过蒸汽锅炉。他想：蒸汽能够炊熟豆，也一定能够炊熟饭，便提出了用蒸汽炊饭。依禄作了一个蒸汽楻，在普通灶锅上装上了两个汤楻，楻面做个盖，用竹管代替无缝钢管，把二个楻接上汽管，再装条汽管通到蒸汽楻去，楻里放上饭罐，一试就成功了，全部设备只花了十八元钱。目前全县已有四百八十一个公共食堂已经建成或正在建立蒸汽灶。
