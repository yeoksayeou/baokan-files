Xinhua News Agency, 10th: With an unprecedented bumper cotton harvest and the people's ever-increasing needs, the question of how the textile industry can meet these needs was the focus of a recent National Conference of Textile Industry Bureau Directors. The conference determined that the guiding principle for the development of the textile industry in 1959 is: "Under the unified leadership of the Party, comprehensively implement the 'Four Highs' (high speed, high output, high quality, high technology) and 'Four Savings' (saving electricity, saving raw materials, saving labor, saving financial resources); combine indigenous and foreign methods, vigorously launch mass movements, vigorously carry out technical and cultural revolutions, and develop China's textile industry at high speed to meet the people's growing needs."

This principle is proposed based on the current major situation of the textile industry. The conference believes that the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the textile industry in 1958 is very encouraging. It is expected that the annual cotton yarn production plan can be completed ahead of schedule by mid-November. However, due to this year's unprecedented bumper cotton harvest, the existing cotton textile production capacity is far from meeting the rapidly growing needs of raw materials, and next year's cotton production will have a greater leap forward on the basis of this year, which makes the contradiction between textile production capacity and raw cotton supply more prominent; at the same time, on the basis of developing production, the people's living standards are improving day by day, especially many people's communes have implemented a semi-supply and semi-wage system, and the demand for textiles has also greatly increased. Both of these aspects require the textile industry to break with convention and develop at a higher speed on the basis of this year's Great Leap Forward.

The conference believes that to achieve a greater leap forward in the textile industry, it is necessary to comprehensively implement the requirements of the "Four Highs" and "Four Savings" in work. Its central requirement is to develop the textile industry at high speed with more, faster, better, and more economical results. It is the specific implementation of the Party's general line in the textile industry. The conference requires that the national textile industry, whether it is production, capital construction, machinery manufacturing, or all other affiliated enterprises, must comprehensively implement these requirements and continue to use them as an important driving force for mobilizing the masses and organizing a greater leap forward in the future.

The conference believes that to develop the textile industry at high speed, cotton textiles must be the focus at present. Because, whether from the supply of raw materials, the needs of the people, or the production capacity of existing equipment, it is required to vigorously develop the cotton textile industry first. When arranging production, capital construction, and machinery manufacturing tasks, all localities should first ensure the needs of cotton textile development. At the same time, the development of wool, hemp, silk, and other textile industries should not be ignored. Every effort should be made to tap and increase the resources of textile raw materials such as wool, hemp, and silk so that these industries can also develop as soon as possible.

The conference emphasized that the fundamental measure to achieve a greater leap forward in the textile industry in 1959 is to vigorously launch mass movements and vigorously carry out technical and cultural revolutions under the unified leadership of the Party. The conference believes that the textile industry, like other industries, must also walk on two legs: "large, foreign, and mass" and "small, indigenous, and mass." Because relying solely on the "large, foreign, and mass" leg is far from meeting the requirements of high-speed development of the textile industry, especially in the current situation of insufficient textile machinery manufacturing capacity. And the Chinese people have rich experience in indigenous spinning and weaving. After the implementation of people's communes in rural areas, the development of "small, indigenous, and mass" has many favorable conditions.

Regarding the "large, foreign, and mass" issue, the conference believes that in the past year, under the leadership of the local Party committees, textile enterprises in various places have launched a massive mass movement. The communist consciousness of the vast number of employees has been greatly improved, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high. This is the main reason for the Great Leap Forward in the textile industry this year. However, at present, the mass movement in large enterprises is still developing unevenly. In some enterprises, the phenomenon of blindly believing in experts, books, and rules and regulations has not been completely eliminated. Based on the experience exchanged by various places at the meeting, the conference requires all textile enterprises to implement the experience of "Four Greats" (speaking out freely, airing views fully, writing big-character posters, and holding great debates), "Two Participations" (cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management), "One Reform" (reforming rules and regulations), and "Three Combinations" (combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers) more widely and deeply under the leadership of the Party, and push the mass movement in large enterprises to a new climax.

The conference also initially determined the development plan for the textile industry in 1959, roughly arranged the textile production, machinery manufacturing, and capital construction tasks for this winter and next spring, and studied in detail the specific measures to complete these tasks.

The conference was held in Beijing from October 29 to November 6.

    棉花大丰收纺织巧安排
    全国纺织工业会议制定高速度发展方针
    据新华社10日讯　全国棉花空前丰收，人民的生活需要也日益提高，纺织工业如何满足这一需要，最近召开的全国纺织工业厅局长会议，集中地研究了这个问题。会议确定1959年纺织工业发展的方针是：“在党的统一领导下，全面贯彻‘四高’（高速度、高产量、高质量、高技术）、‘四省’（省电力、省原材料、省劳动力、省财力）；土洋结合、大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命和文化革命，高速度地发展我国纺织工业，以满足人民日益增长的需要。”
    这个方针是根据纺织工业当前的主要形势提出来的。会议认为1958年纺织工业大跃进的形势，是非常令人振奋的。预计到11月中旬，就可以提前完成全年原定的棉纱生产计划。但是由于今年棉花的空前丰收，现有棉纺织的生产能力已远远不能满足原料迅速增长的需要，而明年棉花生产将在今年的基础上有更大的跃进，这就使纺织生产能力和原棉供应之间的矛盾更加突出；同时在发展生产的基础上，人民生活水平正在日益提高，特别是许多人民公社实行了半供给制和半工资制，对纺织品的需要量也大大增长，这两方面都要求纺织工业打破常规，在今年大跃进的基础上，以更高的速度向前发展。
    会议认为要实现纺织工业的更大跃进，必须在工作中全面贯彻“四高”、“四省”的要求。它的中心要求就是要多快好省地高速度地发展纺织工业，它是党的总路线在纺织工业中的具体贯彻。会议要求全国纺织工业，无论生产、基本建设、机械制造和其它一切附属企业都要全面贯彻这些要求，并且继续把它作为发动群众，组织今后更大跃进的重要动力。
    会议认为要高速度发展纺织工业，在当前必须以棉纺织为重点。因为无论从原料供应情况，人民需要情况和现有设备生产能力情况来看，都要求首先大力发展棉纺织工业。各地在安排生产、基本建设和机械制造任务的时候，都应该首先保证棉纺织发展的需要。同时也不应忽视毛、麻、丝等纺织工业的发展，应该千方百计地挖掘和增加毛、麻、丝等纺织原料资源，使这些工业也能尽快地发展。
    会议强调指出，要实现1959年纺织工业更大跃进的根本措施，是要在党的统一领导下，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命和文化革命。会议认为纺织工业和其他工业一样，也要用“大、洋、群”和“小、土、群”两条腿走路，因为单靠“大、洋、群”这条腿已远远不能满足高速度发展纺织工业的要求，特别在当前纺织机械制造能力不足的情况下更是如此。而我国人民对于土纺土织有着丰富的经验，在农村实行人民公社化以后，发展“小、土、群”已经具备了许多有利的条件。
    关于“大、洋、群”问题，会议认为，一年来各地纺织企业在当地党委领导下，掀起了声势浩大的群众运动，广大职工共产主义觉悟大大提高，革命干劲空前高涨，这是今年纺织工业大跃进的主要原因，但是目前大企业的群众运动还发展得不平衡，有些企业中迷信专家、迷信书本、迷信规章制度的现象还没有完全破除，根据会上各地交流的经验，会议要求所有纺织企业必须在党的领导下，更广泛、更深入地推行“四大”（大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论），“两参”（干部参加劳动，工人参加管理），“一改”（改革规章制度），“三结合”（领导干部、技术人员、工人三结合）的经验，把大企业的群众运动推向新的高潮。
    这次会议还初步确定了1959年纺织工业发展规划，大体安排了今冬明春的纺织生产、机械制造和基本建设任务，并且详细地研究了完成这些任务的具体措施。
    会议是10月29日到11月6日在北京举行的。
