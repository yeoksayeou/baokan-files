Xinhua News Agency, 28th - The youth activists who are holding high the red flag in the "pioneer" ranks of transportation are joyously singing the triumphant song at the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference today. Their speeches show that the youth on the transportation front of the motherland will forever be the pioneers in the nationwide Great Leap Forward.

"Haul More, Run Faster, Support the Steel Commander!" This is the common battle cry of the train drivers. Guan Deming, a train driver from the 5032 youth contract team of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, delivered a speech at the conference with this resounding title.

The Sujiatun Locomotive Depot is the throat station of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, a railway intersection connecting many major cities and industrial bases in Northeast China and within the Shanhaiguan Pass. On average, a train departs from this station every ten minutes, with more than 240 trains per day. A large amount of steel and rails produced by Anshan Iron and Steel, machine tools from Dalian, coal and ore from Fushun and all parts of the country supporting Anshan Iron and Steel, and other major materials must be transferred from this station. All members of the 5032 Youth Contract Team, deeply aware of the importance of their mission, boldly broke the old regulations that "the train can only haul 2,800 tons uphill and 1,800 tons downhill," and leaped to a new record of hauling 3,600 tons uphill and 3,586 tons downhill, despite the opposition of some with conservative ideas. In the past, a locomotive could only haul a maximum of 40 cars, but once they hauled 101 cars, loaded with more than 5,900 tons of goods, creating a national record of 2,341,000 ton-kilometers per day.

After setting the new record, Guan Deming's thinking was further liberated. He also proposed reforming the unreasonable aspects of "single-engine operation." The so-called "single-engine operation" means that a locomotive is only allowed to run if it can haul 50 cars, otherwise it has to run empty. After his proposal was adopted, their group put forward the slogan "Carry eggs southbound, carry scrap metal northbound," hauling as much as possible, and taking whatever they could, avoiding running empty. Once, when he re-hooked cars from Lingshan Station to Sujiatun, he created a record of hauling 120 cars with a load of 6,000 tons. At the same time, he also came up with a way to save coal, saving more than 60 tons in just four months.

Guan Deming said that during the conference, he was also considering reforming the automatic coal feeder of the locomotive to solve the difficulties of winter transportation, and considering using exhaust gas to heat coal cars to increase the temperature of the coal, so as to save coal for locomotives in winter. He said that after returning, he will further promote hauling more and running faster to ensure the "steel commander" can take the stage.

"Break down superstitions, conquer the Sichuan River, and let goods flow as smoothly as river water!" Yang Xianfa, the engine captain of the "Yangtze Youth" tugboat, expressed such a firm determination in his speech. He reported to everyone at the meeting the heroic deeds of some young sailors on their "Yangtze Youth" in braving the wind and waves and opening the way for the Great Leap Forward.

The "Yangtze Youth" is a 2,000-horsepower tugboat sailing from Chongqing to Hankou. Since the Great Leap Forward, they have successively created nine highest records in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River, including shallow water navigation, overloading, and night navigation. In the past, no one dared to risk sailing when the water level of the Yangtze River dropped below zero, but the young sailors bravely broke down superstitions and successfully tested safe navigation when the water level was only minus 24 centimeters. When passing through the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, they towed thirteen barges at once, greatly increasing the turnover rate of tugs and barges. At the same time, they successfully tested night navigation on the Sichuan River between Wanxian and Yichang, opening the way for night navigation on the Sichuan River, which is equivalent to doubling the number of ships on the Yangtze River.

Among the "pioneers" of transportation, road transportation is also a very important aspect. Duan Fengxi, a truck driver from the Handan Prefectural Transportation Company of Hebei Province, introduced the company's experience in implementing "motor vehicle trainization" at the meeting.

The company has more than 2,000 employees and more than 500 vehicles, undertaking the transportation tasks of more than a dozen counties in the entire region. In order to support the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, the employees modestly learned from the experience of other places and actively implemented "motor vehicle trainization." Duan Fengxi took the lead in this and made remarkable achievements. He once used a Liberation brand truck to tow sixteen trailers at a time, fully loaded with 90 tons of goods, and safely completed 53 kilometers without any accidents. From January to the end of October this year, the main vehicle completed a total of 178,200 ton-kilometers of transportation tasks, and the trailer also completed 108,080 ton-kilometers of transportation tasks from June to the end of October. Before the implementation of motor vehicle trainization, it could only run 700 ton-kilometers per day, but now it can run an average of more than 2,400 ton-kilometers per day, and the highest reaches more than 3,000 ton-kilometers.

Duan Fengxi pointed out with his own experience that the potential of the main vehicle is very large, and the trainization movement may develop to a higher stage, being able to tow more vehicles and carry more goods.

Nine thousand and three hundred commanders and fighters from a youth construction division who are building the Jilin Provincial Communist Youth League Railway, sent their representatives Liu Hanwen and Feng Guiqin to participate in the conference. These two youth activists spoke jointly today about the many moving deeds of the youth throughout their division in building this railway.

This team of young builders was formed under the call of the Party. When they first entered the construction site, they encountered many difficulties. Because there were not enough houses, more than 7,000 people in the division had to live in the firewood stacks, stables, and corn cribs of local farmers, and they also ate in the open air on rainy days. In the deep mountains and dense forests, they also fought bravely against poisonous snakes and beasts. All these difficulties were conquered by them one by one.

During the project, the youth of the entire division showed unparalleled enthusiasm. In particular, the letter from the General Office of the Central Committee of the Party and the telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League gave them great encouragement. Two "100-meter camps" (each person excavating and transporting more than 100 cubic meters of earth and stone per day) emerged in the entire division, and more "100-meter platoons," "100-meter classes," and "100-meter individuals" emerged, thus greatly accelerating the progress of the project. There are also more than 300 young women in their division, and they also worked selflessly like their male comrades.

After more than three months of labor, these young people have basically mastered a relatively complete set of railway construction techniques. The Youth Construction Division has become a railway construction force with complete types of work.

In the speeches this afternoon, several youth activists from construction sites talked about how they erected the banner of rapid construction and worked selflessly to accelerate the country's construction speed. Sun Qiugen, the representative of the Youth Engineering Team of the 202nd Engineering Department of the Henan Provincial Second Construction Engineering Company, said that all the employees of their engineering department only used 32 working days to build a large main factory building exterior structure project with an area of 34,000 square feet, which usually takes six months to a year to build, and the quality is excellent. The joint speech by Song Shichun and other five youth representatives from the Baotou Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, as well as the speeches by Zhang Baifa, the captain of the steel bar youth shock team of the Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company, and Tao Jian'an, the leader of the youth shock team of the Zhejiang Xin'anjiang Hydropower Engineering Bureau, all used concrete facts to provide vivid examples for the correct policy of rapid construction.

At today's conference, the speech by Tu Qixing, a former Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier who had just returned to the motherland from the world-famous Shangganling heroic position in Korea, was particularly warmly welcomed. In his speech, Tu Qixing reported on the heroic achievements they created on the Korean battlefield, introduced the situation of their helping the Korean people rebuild their homeland after the war, and used many vivid facts to describe the profound brotherly feelings of the Korean people towards the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese people. He finally said: "The Korean War once again vividly confirmed Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion. American imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger that has been punctured. It now dares to create tension in our Taiwan region and attempt to interfere with our people's liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, which is truly beyond its capacity! No force in the world can stop us from moving forward. American imperialism is not a problem for us at all. We must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and we must complete the sacred cause of unifying the motherland!" His remarks sparked a thunderous applause in the entire venue. Before his speech, Zhang Yimin, the chief of staff of a certain torpedo speedboat squadron of the People's Navy from the Fujian front, reported on their victorious results in severely punishing the enemy at sea, and his speech was also warmly welcomed.

This afternoon, the youth of the directly subordinate organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China presented gifts to the conference. A gift-giving team consisting of 250 people, led by a national flag and a Party flag, entered the venue to the sound of gongs and drums. At this time, the audience stood up and thunderous applause rang out. The youth presenting the gifts carried models, charts, and objects introducing the leap forward in their business work and the achievements they had made in various activities such as steelmaking, eliminating the four pests, and militia training.

A total of 24 people spoke at the conference today. Among them are: Jiang Jinshan, the youth captain of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Leping County, Jiangxi Province, and a special researcher at the Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Science; Lin Jilin, the youth peanut satellite team leader of the Futu People's Commune in Zhangpu County, Fujian Province; Tan Changqiao, a special-class honorary serviceman of the Dongshan People's Commune in Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province; Wang Qinghan, the deputy secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League; Fu Yunhua, the first secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Guangmu Township People's Commune in Xuyong County, Sichuan Province; Luo Buseng, a Mongolian youth lama from Haolitu Temple in the West Ujimqin Banner of the Xilin Gol League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; Yang Fengxian, a Hui female youth from the Yuejin People's Commune in Lingwu County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region; Bao Lianhua, a Mongolian female livestock breeding worker from the Keertai People's Commune in the Dorbod Mongolian Autonomous County, Heilongjiang Province; Man Xita, a Tibetan youth from the Sujitan People's Commune in the Qilian Hui Autonomous County, Qinghai Province; Bu Bulayin Bai Batu'er, a Kazakh youth from the Second Ranch of the Fourth Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps; Liu Ye, a representative of the youth activists of the directly subordinate organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; Xiong Xingyi, a youth representative of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Transportation Administration (six people spoke jointly); Li Shiming, a young actor from the Minghua Peking Opera Troupe in Beijing; and Wu Xiankang, a representative of the youth fitter group from the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai. The conference also distributed written speeches from eight other youth activists.

The conference will continue tomorrow.

    立志做大跃进的开路先锋
    交通运输战线上的青年积极分子欢唱胜利的凯歌
    新华社28日讯　在交通运输“先行官”的队列里高举红旗的青年积极分子们，今天在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上欢唱胜利的凯歌。他们的发言显示出，祖国交通运输战线上的青年们，将永远成为全民大跃进中的开路先锋。
    “多拉快跑，支援钢帅”，这是火车司机们共同的战斗语言。沈阳铁路局苏家屯机务段五○三二号青年包车组火车司机关德明用这样一个响亮的题目在大会上发言。
    苏家屯机务段是沈阳铁路局的咽喉车站，是联结着东北和关内许多主要城市和工业基地的铁路交叉点。这个车站平均每十分钟就要发出一次列车，每天列车流量有二百四十多次。鞍钢生产的大量钢材、钢轨，大连的机床，抚顺和全国各地支援鞍钢的煤、矿石以及其它主要物资都要由这个站转运。五○三二号青年包车组的全体成员，深知自己任务的重要，他们不顾某些有保守思想的人的反对，大胆打破“上行只准牵引二千八百吨，下行牵引一千八百吨”的陈规旧章，跃进到上行牵引三千六百吨，下行牵引三千五百八十六吨的新纪录。过去一辆机车最多只能牵引四十辆车皮，可是他们有一次却牵引了一百零一辆车皮，装载了五千九百多吨货物，创造了日产二百三十四万一千吨公里的全国最高纪录。
    创造了新纪录以后，使关德明的思想进一步地解放了，他又提出倡议：改革“单机行车”不合理的地方。所谓“单机行车”，就是一个机车要牵引够五十台车皮才准行车，不足数量机车就得空跑。他这个倡议被采纳后，他们小组就提出
  “南下蛋、北捎脚”的口号，能多拉就多拉，能带的就带着，不跑空车。有一次，他从灵山站重挂车到苏家屯，又创造了牵引一百二十台车皮、载重量达六千吨的纪录。同时，他还想出办法节约煤，仅四个月就节省了六十多吨。
    关德明说，他在会议期间又在考虑革新机车的自动穿煤机，以解决冬季运输难题，并考虑用废气加热煤车，增加煤的温度，好节约冬季机车用煤。他表示回去以后要进一步大搞多拉快跑，保证钢铁元帅升帐。
    “破除迷信，征服川江，让货物像江水一样的畅流！”“长江青年号”拖轮轮机长杨先发在发言中表示了这样的坚定的决心，他在会上向大家报告了他们“长江青年号”上的一些年轻的海员如何乘风破浪，为大跃进开道的英雄事迹。
    “长江青年号”是航行在重庆到汉口的一艘二千马力的拖轮。大跃进以来，他们先后创造了长江中、上游浅水航行、超载拖运、夜航等九次最高纪录。过去从来没有人敢冒着危险在长江水位降到零度以下时航行，但是青年海员们却勇敢地破除了迷信，在水位只有零下二十四公分时试验安全通航成功。在通过武汉长江大桥时，一次拖了十三个驳船，大大增加了轮驳的周转率。同时，他们又在万县到宜昌之间的川江上试验夜航成功，给川江夜航开辟了道路，等于在长江上又增加一倍的船只。
    在交通运输“先行官”中，公路运输也是很重要的一个方面。河北省邯郸专区交通运输公司汽车司机段凤喜，在会上介绍了他们公司实行“汽车列车化”的经验。
    这个公司共有两千多职工，五百多辆汽车，担负着全专区十多个县的运输任务。为了支援工农业大跃进，职工们虚心学习外地经验，积极实行“汽车列车化”。段凤喜在这当中起了带头作用，做出了显著成绩。他曾经用一辆解放牌汽车，一次拖带十六个车斗，满载九十吨货物，安全跑完五十三公里，没有出任何事故。他从今年1月到10月底，主车共完成运输任务十七万八千二百多吨公里，从6月到10月底拖车也完成运输任务十万八千零八十多吨公里。实行汽车列车化以前，每天只能跑七百吨公里，现在每天平均可以跑二千四百多吨公里，最高达到三千多吨公里。
    段凤喜以他的切身经验指出，主车的潜力很大，列车化运动，还可能向更高阶段发展，能拖更多的车，载更多的货。
    正在建设吉林省共青团铁路的一支青年建设师的九千三百名指战员，派出了他们的代表刘汉文、冯桂琴来参加大会。这两位青年积极分子今天在联合发言中谈到了他们全师青年在修建这条铁路中许多动人的事迹。
    这支青年建设者的队伍是在党的号召下组成的。当他们开始进入工地的时候，就遇到许多困难。因为住房不够，全师有七千多人只得住在当地农民的柴火垛、马棚和玉米楼子里，下雨天也是露天吃饭，在深山密林里，他们还同毒蛇猛兽进行了英勇的搏斗。所有这些困难都被他们一个个征服了。
    在工程中，全师青年发挥了无比的干劲，特别是党中央办公厅的信和团中央的电报，给了他们极大的鼓舞。全师出现了两个“百米营”（每人一天挖运土石方一百立方公尺以上），还涌现出更多的“百米排”、“百米班”和“百米个人”，因而大大加快了工程的进度。在他们师里还有三百多名女青年，她们也和男同志一样忘我地劳动。
    经过三个多月的劳动，这些青年们已经基本上掌握了一套比较完整的建设铁路技术。青年建设师已经成为一支有完整工种的铁路建设部队。
    在今天下午的发言中，有几位来自建筑工程工地的青年积极分子谈到他们怎样树起快速施工的旗帜，为加快祖国的建设速度而忘我劳动。河南省第二建筑工程公司二○二工程处青年工程队代表孙秋根说，他们工程处全体职工仅仅用了三十二个工作日，就建成了一座通常需要半年到一年时间才能建成的面积达三万四千平方尺的大型主厂房外型结构工程，而且质量优良。包头钢铁联合企业宋世纯等五位青年代表的联合发言，以及北京市第三建筑工程公司钢筋青年突击队队长张百发、浙江省新安江水力发电工程局青年突击班班长陶建安的发言，都用具体事实为快速施工这一正确的方针提供生动的例证。
    在今天的大会上，不久以前才从闻名世界的朝鲜上甘岭英雄阵地回到祖国的前中国人民志愿军战士涂启兴的发言，受到了特别热烈的欢迎。涂启兴在发言中报告了他们在朝鲜战场上创造的英雄战迹，介绍了他们在战后帮助朝鲜人民重建家园的情况，并用许多生动的事实，叙述了朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军和中国人民所表现的兄弟般的深厚感情。他最后说：“朝鲜战争再一次生动地证实了毛主席的英明论断。美帝国主义不过是一只被戳穿了的纸老虎。它现在竟敢在我们台湾地区制造紧张局势，妄图干涉我国人民解放台、澎、金、马，真是自不量力！世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡我们前进，美帝国主义根本不在我们话下。我们一定要解放台、澎、金、马，我们一定要完成统一祖国的神圣大业！”他的这段话在全场激起了一阵怒涛般的掌声。在他发言以前，来自福建前线的人民海军某鱼雷快艇大队参谋长张逸民，报告了他们在海上狠狠惩罚敌人的胜利战果，他的发言同样受到了热烈的欢迎。
    今天下午，中共中央直属机关青年向大会献礼。由二百五十人组成的献礼大队以一面国旗和一面党旗为先导，在锣鼓声中进入会场。这时全场起立，响起了雷动般的掌声。献礼的青年们抬着各种介绍他们业务工作跃进情况以及在炼钢、除四害、民兵训练等各项活动中所取得的成就的模型、图表和实物。
    今天在大会上发言的共二十四人。他们之中还有：江西省乐平县东风人民公社青年队长、江西省科学研究所特约研究员蒋金山，福建省漳浦县浮土人民公社青年花生卫星队队长林吉麟，湖南省湘乡县东山人民公社特等荣誉军人谭长桥，共青团江苏省委副书记王庆汉、四川省叙永县广木乡人民公社团委第一书记傅运华，内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟西乌珠穆沁旗好力图庙的蒙古族青年喇嘛罗布僧，宁夏回族自治区灵武县跃进人民公社的回族女青年杨凤仙，黑龙江省杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县克尔台人民公社的蒙族女畜牧配种员包莲花，青海省亹源回族自治县苏吉滩人民公社的藏族青年满西塔，新疆生产建设兵团第四师第二牧场的哈萨克族青年布不拉音巴衣巴吐尔，中共中央直属机关青年积极分子代表刘野，青藏公路交通运输管理局青年代表熊星益（六人联合发言），北京市鸣华京剧团青年演员李士明，上海江南造船厂青年钳工小组代表邬显康。大会另外还分发了八位青年积极分子的书面发言。
    大会明天将继续举行。
