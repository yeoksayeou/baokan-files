(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: General Ayub Khan, who just took over the presidency of Pakistan, told foreign reporters on the 30th that Pakistan should establish a "presidential system" that gives the president great power, and that he should be given more time to complete his tasks. He said that he felt that "in the past, there were too many troubles in the separation of powers between the president and the prime minister."

Ayub Khan said that the expected form of the "constitution" would be similar to France's "new constitution," but "tighter" than it, and the president might need even more power than De Gaulle has obtained. He said that Pakistan will establish a central government and a parliament, and political parties will only be able to operate within a limited scope.

Delhi's public opinion is closely watching the US military aid to Pakistan and the activities of US Secretary of Defense McElroy in Karachi during the recent military coup in Pakistan.

According to the Press Trust of India, McElroy interfered in Pakistan's military coup. In addition to discussing with the Pakistani government about supplying more American weapons to Pakistan, he also held important secret talks on the political situation in Pakistan.

    阿尤布汗要独揽大权
    印度舆论指责美国干预巴基斯坦军事政变
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：刚接管巴基斯坦总统职权的阿尤布汗将军30日对外国记者说，巴基斯坦应该建立给总统以大权的“总统制”，并且要给他更多的时间去完成他的任务。他说，他感到“过去在总统同总理分权方面，麻烦太多了”。
    阿尤布汗说，期望中的“宪法”的形式将同法国的“新宪法”相似，但是比它“更紧些”，并且总统可能需要的权力甚至比戴高乐所获得的权力还大些。他说，巴基斯坦将建立一个中央政府和一个议会，政党将只能在有限的范围内活动。
    德里舆论密切注意在最近巴基斯坦的军事政变中，美国给巴基斯坦的军事援助和美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊在卡拉奇进行的活动。
    据印度新闻社报道，麦克耳罗伊曾经干预巴基斯坦的军事政变。他在那里除了同巴基斯坦政府商谈关于把更多的美国武器供给巴基斯坦的问题以外，还就巴基斯坦的政局进行了重要的秘密会谈。
