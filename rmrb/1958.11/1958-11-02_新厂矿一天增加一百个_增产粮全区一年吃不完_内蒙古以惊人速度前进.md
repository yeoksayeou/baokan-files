    New Factories and Mines Increase by One Hundred per Day; Increased Grain Production More Than the Entire Region Can Eat in a Year
    Inner Mongolia Advances at an Astonishing Speed
    (Our dispatch) Under the radiant illumination of the Party's great ethnic policy, the economic and cultural construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is leaping forward at an astonishing speed.
    In the early days of liberation, Inner Mongolia had almost no industry. Now, it has 158,460 various types of factories and mines, the vast majority of which were built during this year's Great Leap Forward. This year, an average of 100 new factories and mines were completed every day. From January to September, the region's industrial output value reached more than 740 million yuan, exceeding the plan to double the total industrial output value compared to last year three months ahead of schedule. Nearly 40,000 various types of iron-smelting furnaces and steel-making furnaces are scattered throughout cities, towns, mountainous areas, and grasslands. In the early days of liberation, Inner Mongolia had to rely on other places for even simple tools such as shovels, hoes, and sickles. Now, a network of machinery manufacturing and repair facilities has been established. From January to September this year, more than 1,400 new products have been trial-produced to serve industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production, as well as the needs of people of all ethnic groups. Many of these are mechanically manufactured industrial products with complex structures and high precision, such as the high-precision milk separators, which, in addition to meeting the needs of towns, villages, and grasslands in the autonomous region, have also been supplied to Jilin, Shanxi, Hebei, Gansu, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In addition, a large number of blowers and smelting equipment have been manufactured for supply both within and outside the region. Light industry has developed even faster. Currently, a type of white sugar called "Prairie Brand" can be seen on the markets of North China. It is a product of Inner Mongolia's first modern sugar refinery - the Baotou Sugar Refinery, which can produce more than 20,000 tons of granulated sugar annually. From the beginning of the year to mid-October, the number of dairy factories has almost doubled and a half compared to the total number of factories built during the First Five-Year Plan (43). Currently, the cream and casein produced in the autonomous region are exported not only to socialist countries but also to countries such as Egypt and the United Kingdom. Regardless of light or heavy industry, the backward state of exporting raw materials and importing finished products has been changed. The forest industry has developed from handicraft operations to mechanized operations. The timber felling volume in 1957 increased by more than 33 times compared to 1946 in the early days of liberation.
    In the overall Great Leap Forward, farmland water conservancy construction takes the lead. The irrigated area of the autonomous region has leaped from 12 million mu last year to more than 24 million mu, greatly changing the drought situation in Inner Mongolia. The amount of fertilizer applied has increased twofold. As a result, agricultural production has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. This year, the total grain output of the autonomous region (excluding soybeans) is expected to reach 12.8 billion catties, an increase of 1.3 times compared to last year. The increase alone is enough for more than 9 million people in the region to eat for more than a year. At present, the people's commune system has been basically realized in the rural areas of the region.
    In pastoral areas, the number of households participating in pastoral cooperatives and joint public-private livestock farms has increased from 27% of the total number of pastoral households last year to more than 90%. The total number of livestock has increased from 22.39 million head last year to 25.09 million head, exceeding this year's production increase target. Among them, the net increase rate of livestock in many pastoral cooperatives has reached more than 60%, creating the highest record of livestock reproduction rate. With the great development of pastoral cooperation, the construction of settlements in pastoral areas is accelerating. From last winter to this spring, herdsmen have drilled more than 5,400 new wells on the grasslands and completed many small reservoirs, ponds, dams, canals and other projects, which have enabled many Sumu (districts) and pastoral cooperatives to realize water conservancy.
    Simultaneous with the Great Leap Forward in various production and construction undertakings, a large-scale mass cultural revolution upsurge is taking shape to meet the needs of the mass technical revolution. At present, more than 95% of school-age children of all ethnic groups in the region have entered primary schools, and primary school graduates have basically entered secondary schools, popularizing primary and secondary education. By October 1, illiteracy among young and middle-aged people of all ethnic groups in the region has been basically eliminated. The cultural life of the vast rural and pastoral areas has become active. Clubs, people-run libraries, amateur theater troupes, people-run song and dance troupes, broadcasting stations, and cultural stations have been generally established in rural areas. A mass cultural network centered on the "Ulanmuqi" (Mongolian: Red Cavalry) has also been formed in pastoral areas.

### 新厂矿一天增加一百个　增产粮全区一年吃不完  内蒙古以惊人速度前进

    新厂矿一天增加一百个　增产粮全区一年吃不完
    内蒙古以惊人速度前进
    本报讯　在党的伟大民族政策光辉照耀下，内蒙古自治区的经济、文化建设事业正以惊人的速度飞跃发展。
    解放初期，内蒙古几乎没有什么工业，现在已经有各类大小厂矿十五万八千四百六十座，其中绝大部分是在今年大跃进中兴建的。今年平均每天建成新厂矿一百座。全区一至三季度工业产值已达七亿四千多万元，提前三个月超额完成了工业生产总值比去年翻一番的计划。将近四万个各种类型的炼铁炉和炼钢炉，遍布城乡和山区、草原。解放初，内蒙古连铁锹、镐头、镰刀等简单工具都要依靠外地，现已形成一个星罗棋布的机械制造修配网。从今年1至9月份，共试制了为工农牧业生产服务和为各族人民生活需用的新产品一千四百多种。其中有许多是构造复杂、精密度较高的机械工业产品，如精密度较高的牛奶分离机，除供应自治区城镇、农村和草原需要外，还供应了吉林、山西、河北、甘肃和新疆维吾尔自治区等地。另外还制造了大批鼓风机和冶炼设备供应区内和外地。轻工业发展更快，目前在华北各地市场上看到一种名叫“草原牌”的白砂糖，就是内蒙古第一座现代化制糖厂——包头糖厂的产品，这座糖厂每年可生产砂糖两万多吨。从年初到10月中旬，乳品工厂比第一个五年计划期间建厂总和（四十三座）几乎增加一倍半。目前自治区生产的奶油、酪胶除输出社会主义国家外，还向埃及、英国等国输出。不论轻重工业，都改变了历史上输出原料、输入成品的落后状态。森林工业已由手工业操作发展成为机械化作业。1957年的木材采伐量比解放初期的1946年增长三十三倍多。
    在全面大跃进中，农田水利建设一马当先。自治区灌溉面积由去年的一千二百万亩跃进到二千四百多万亩，使内蒙古的干旱面貌大大改观。施肥量增加了两倍。因而，今年农业生产获得了空前丰收。今年自治区粮食总产量（不包括大豆）预计可达一百二十八亿斤，比去年增加一点三倍，仅增产部分，即够全区九百多万人吃一年多。现在全区农村已经基本实现人民公社化。
    在牧区，参加牧业社和公私合营牧场的牧户由去年占总牧户的27％发展到90％以上。牲畜总头数由去年的二千二百三十九万头增加到二千五百零九万头，超额完成今年增产任务。其中有不少牧业社的牲畜纯增率达到了60％以上，创造了牲畜增殖率的最高纪录。牧区的定居地建设随着牧业合作化大发展，正在加速进行。去冬今春，牧民在草原上打了五千四百多眼新井，完成了很多小型水库、塘坝、渠道等工程，已使不少苏木（区）、牧业社实现了水利化。
    与各项生产建设事业大跃进的同时，适应着群众性的技术革命的需要，一个大规模的群众文化革命高潮正在形成。现在，区内95％以上的各族学龄儿童入了小学，高小毕业生基本上都升入了中学，普及了中小学教育。到10月1日，全区基本上扫除了各族青壮年文盲。广大农村、牧区的文化生活活跃起来了，俱乐部、民办图书馆、业余剧团和民办歌舞团、广播站、文化站已在农村普遍建立起来，牧区以“乌兰牧骑”（蒙语：红色之部）为中心的群众文化网也已形成。
