Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch: According to a report by the Japanese Kyodo News, the Kishi Nobusuke government is determined to disregard the strong opposition of the Japanese people and insist on revising the Japan-US "Security Treaty" into a Japan-US "Joint Assistance Treaty" in order to tie Japan even more tightly to the American war chariot.

According to Kyodo News, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kishi Nobusuke government has already drafted the "outline" of the Japan-US "Joint Assistance Treaty" and intends to "basically reach an agreement" with the United States by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.

In view of the strong opposition of the Japanese people to the signing of a new Japan-US military treaty, the Kishi Nobusuke government is playing word games in the "outline" to make the Japan-US "Joint Assistance Treaty" "distinguish itself from the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization system, which has recently been subjected to particularly severe criticism, in order to answer those condemnations that the new treaty will increase the possibility of dragging Japan into war, and suspicions that it may assume more new obligations than it does now."

Nevertheless, it is not difficult to see from the outline itself and the Kyodo News report that the essence of the new Japan-US military treaty is still: in the name of "joint assistance," Japan will serve as a tool for the United States to carry out aggression in the Far East and take the opportunity to repeat the old path of aggression against China and "southward advance."

Disregarding Japan's independent sovereignty, Kishi Nobusuke's treaty outline first stipulates that "US troops stationed in Japan have the task (obligation) of defending Japan, Okinawa Island, and the Ogasawara Islands against armed attacks (or threats to peace and security) in these areas." The Japanese side will provide bases to the US military and "has the task of defending Japan against armed attacks on Japan." Defending Japan is Japan's own business, but now it is deliberately stipulated as Japan's "task" in a "joint assistance" military treaty signed with the United States. Its intention is obviously to use the guise of "defending Japan" to actively rearm Japan and undertake the task of "defending" American bases and serving as cannon fodder for American aggression.

In order to deceive the Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke government is preparing to deliberately "not directly mention the issue of using (US) troops stationed in Japan in the Far East and Western Pacific region" in the Japan-US "Joint Assistance Treaty." However, Kyodo News revealed that Kishi Nobusuke's position on the United States' use of US troops stationed in Japan to carry out aggressive activities in the Far East and Western Pacific region is: he believes that "this is an action taken by the United States in accordance with its right of self-defense," and Japan allows the US military to use military bases in Japan. This means that Japan will play the role of an accomplice in this American military aggression. However, Kishi Nobusuke intends to cover his ears and steal the bell and say that his position is that Japan "does not directly participate" in American military aggression in the Far East and Western Pacific region, and that the US military bases provided by Japan are "only used as supply bases and transit bases," and "not as combat bases."

Regarding the two military bases of Okinawa and Ogasawara under American occupation, the Kishi Nobusuke government believes that "military offensives against these areas can of course use Japanese bases as combat bases." The Japanese side will provide "all other possible assistance," including "cooperation in the use of radar networks and supplies," except that "due to constitutional limitations, Japan will not automatically (!) send Self-Defense Forces to these areas."

These provisions, coupled with the fact that the treaty has already determined that US troops stationed in Japan have the "task" of "defending Okinawa," actually include Okinawa Island in the treaty's applicable area, thus linking the US-Japan treaty and the US-Chiang and US-Lee treaties through Okinawa, the common treaty's applicable area, thereby forming a Northeast Asian military alliance. In this way, when the United States launches a war of aggression against China and other countries in the Western Pacific, Japan, according to the new Japan-US "Joint Assistance Treaty," has the obligation to act as an accomplice in the American war of aggression. Although Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracy to sign a new Japan-US "Joint Assistance Treaty" with the United States and to form a Northeast Asian military alliance in practice through this treaty is obvious, he still wants to deceive himself and others. Kyodo News said that the Kishi Nobusuke government "in order to avoid creating the misunderstanding that this treaty is a military alliance treaty," will not stipulate the declaration of "common danger areas" as stipulated in the US-Lee and US-Chiang treaties in the treaty.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's "outline" stipulates that the "Administrative Agreement" stipulating the privileges of US troops stationed in Japan in accordance with the Japan-US "Security Treaty" will be "inherited largely intact, except for technical details." The only clause to be deleted from the current "Administrative Agreement" is Article 24 concerning joint Japan-US measures in the event of an "emergency" in Japan. This is because the relevant clauses in the Japan-US "Security Treaty" will be deleted. The deletion of this clause is because the military and police forces of the Japanese ruling class to suppress the domestic people have been greatly strengthened.

The Japan-US "Joint Assistance Treaty" will not stipulate a ban on the United States bringing nuclear weapons into Japan. According to the air released by the Kishi Nobusuke government, it will "clearly record in the 'accessory documents' of the treaty that nuclear weapons will not be brought into Japan."

### 不顾日本人民的强烈反对  岸信介坚持要当美国侵略帮凶  外  务省已拟好日美“共同援助条约”提纲

    不顾日本人民的强烈反对
    岸信介坚持要当美国侵略帮凶
    外务省已拟好日美“共同援助条约”提纲
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：据日本共同社报道，岸信介政府决心不顾日本人民的强烈反对，坚持要把日美“安全条约”修改为日美“共同援助条约”，以便把日本更紧地绑在美国的战车上。
    据共同社说，岸信介政府外务省已经拟好了日美“共同援助条约”的“提纲”，并且打算在今年年底或明年年初同美国“大体上达成协议”。
    鉴于日本人民强烈反对签订新的日美军事条约，因此，岸信介政府在“提纲”中耍弄文字游戏，使日美“共同援助条约”“同最近受到特别严厉的批评的东北亚条约组织体制分清界限，来答复那些认为新条约将会增大把日本卷进战争里去的可能性的谴责，和可能承担比现在更多的新的义务的怀疑。”
    尽管如此，从提纲本身和共同社的消息中依然不难看出，新的日美军事条约的实质仍旧是：以“共同援助”为名，使日本充当美国在远东进行侵略的工具，并且乘机重走侵略中国和“南进”的老路。
    岸信介的条约提纲不顾日本的独立主权，首先规定“驻日美军负有这样的任务（义务）：保卫日本、冲绳岛和小笠原群岛，以对付对这些地区的武装攻击（或对和平和安全的威胁）”。日本方面则向美军提供基地，“并且负有保卫日本、对付对日本进行的武装攻击的任务”。保卫日本是日本自己的事，现在却被别有用心地在同美国签订的“共同援助”军事条约中规定为日本的“任务”，它的用意显然是要在“保卫日本”的幌子下，使日本积极重整军备，并且承担“保卫”美国基地和充当美国侵略炮灰的任务。
    为了欺骗日本人民，岸信介政府准备故意在日美“共同援助条约”中“不直接提到关于在远东和西太平洋地区使用（驻日）美军的问题”。但是，共同社透露，对于美国把驻日美军用于在远东和西太平洋地区进行侵略活动，岸信介的立场是：认为“这是美国根据自卫权而采取的行动”，日本允许美军使用在日本的军事基地。这就是说，日本将在美国的这种军事侵略活动中起帮凶作用。虽然如此，岸信介却打算掩耳盗铃地把他的这种立场说成是：日本“不直接参与”美国在远东和西太平洋地区的军事侵略活动，并且把日本提供的美军基地“只作为供应基地和转运基地”，而“不作为作战基地”。
    关于在美国占领下的冲绳和小笠原两个军事基地，岸信介政府认为“对这些地区进行的军事进攻，当然可以把日本的基地作为作战基地来使用。”日本方面，除了“由于宪法的限制，日本不自动地（！）派遣自卫队到这些地区去”以外，将提供包括“在使用雷达网和供应方面实行合作”在内的“其他一切可能的援助”。
    这些规定，再加上这个条约已经首先确定驻日美军负有“保卫冲绳”的“任务”，实际上就是把冲绳岛列入条约适用地区，这样就使美日条约和美蒋、美李条约通过冲绳这个共同的条约适用地区串连起来，从而组成东北亚军事同盟。这样，当美国发动对中国和西太平洋其他国家的侵略战争的时候，日本根据新的日美“共同援助条约”就有义务充当美国进行侵略战争的帮凶。岸信介同美国签订新的日美“共同援助条约”，并且通过这个条约在实际上组成东北亚军事同盟的这种阴谋虽然昭然若揭，但是他还想自欺欺人。共同社说，岸信介政府“为了避免使人们产生以为这个条约是军事同盟条约的误解”，将不在条约中规定宣布像美李、美蒋条约所规定的那样的“共同危险地区”。
    岸信介政府的“提纲”规定，根据日美“安全条约”签订的规定驻日美军特权的“行政协定”，“除了技术性的细节以外，大体上将原封不动地继承下来。”将在现行“行政协定”中删除的唯一条款是关于在日本发生“紧急情况”时日美采取共同措施的第二十四条。这是因为日美“安全条约”中的与此有关的条款将删除。而删除这个条款是因为日本统治阶级镇压国内人民的军警力量已经大大加强。
    日美“共同援助条约”中将不规定禁止美国把核武器运进日本。据岸信介政府放出的空气，说什么要在条约的“附属文件”中“明白记载不把核武器运进日本”。
