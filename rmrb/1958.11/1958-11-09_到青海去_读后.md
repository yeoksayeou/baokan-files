    After Reading “Go to Qinghai”
    We enjoyed reading the report “Go to Qinghai” written by Comrade Nie Meichu, which was published on page 5 of the People’s Daily on October 26th. From the report, we not only heard the sound of the Qinghai people marching forward, but also envisioned the beautiful picture of a new socialist Qinghai.
    The Party calls on us to go to the frontier. Going to the frontier has always been our aspiration. After reading this report, we can’t wait to pack our bags and rush to Qinghai. Recently, many students have written big-character posters asking the Party to approve their going to the frontier.
    This report is very good; it has given us strength and confidence. We hope that more articles like this will be published in the future.

    “到青海去”读后
    10月26日人民日报第五版登了聂眉初同志写的“到青海去”的报道，我们很喜欢读它。从报道里我们不仅听到了青海人民前进的脚步声，而且展望了社会主义新青海的美好图景。
    党号召我们到边疆去。到边疆去是我们一向的志愿，读了这篇报道我们恨不得马上背起背包，奔赴青海。最近很多同学写大字报要求党批准到边疆去。
    这篇报道很好，它给了我们力量和信心。希望今后多登些这样的文章。
