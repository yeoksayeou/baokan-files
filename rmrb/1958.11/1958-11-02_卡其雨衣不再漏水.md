    Khaki Raincoats No Longer Leak
    Raincoats made of rainproof khaki have many advantages, such as being durable and suitable for both wind and rain. Therefore, people generally prefer to use them. However, those who wear these raincoats have a common problem: after wearing them for some time, the raincoats start to leak. This is because ordinary rainproof khaki is made with grease wax or metal salt surface treatment. The rainproofing agent adheres to the surface of the fabric and cannot withstand prolonged washing by rain.
    Now, there's no need to worry. Textile workers have created a "permanent rainproof khaki" for everyone. It is made with high-molecular rainproofing agent treatment, which combines the fibers and the high-molecular rainproofing agent, and is baked at high temperatures. Therefore, the rainproof performance is greatly improved compared to ordinary rainproof khaki. It remains leak-proof even after thirty-seven soap washing tests. In contrast, similar Japanese products leak after only twenty soap washes.

    卡其雨衣不再漏水
    用防雨卡其制成的雨衣，有许多优点，如经久耐穿，能风雨两用，等等。所以一般人还乐于用它。但是，穿这种雨衣的人有一个共同的烦恼：穿些日子以后，雨衣便漏水了。这是因为一般的防雨卡其，是用脂腊或金属盐表面处理制成的，防雨剂附着在织物表面上，经不起雨水长时间冲洗。
    现在不用愁了。纺织工人们已经为大家制成了一种“永久性防雨卡其”。它是用高分子防雨剂处理制成的，使纤维和高分子防雨剂结合，并且经过高温烘焙，所以防雨性能比一般的防雨卡其大大提高。经过三十七次皂洗试验仍不漏水。而日本的同类产品经皂洗二十次就要漏水。
