Xinhua News Agency, 31st: Taipei News: Today, Taiwan's newspapers all published a lengthy statement by Chiang Kai-shek, in which he clamored that to "complete the task of anti-communist national recovery," it is necessary to "emphasize both military and political affairs," and to "rely on politics" as well as "rely on military affairs."

In this statement issued for the sixth anniversary of the establishment of Taiwan's "Youth Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps," Chiang Kai-shek said: "I once said the words 'three parts military, seven parts politics,' and this sentence is still applicable today."

The so-called "three parts military, seven parts politics" was a slogan Chiang Kai-shek put forward during the long-term anti-people civil war.

Chiang Kai-shek's statement was issued after the US authorities repeatedly touted that the US had obtained a "guarantee" from Chiang Kai-shek "not to use force." After the release of the Chiang-Dulles meeting communique, responsible persons of the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly stated that the Taiwan authorities are not prepared to give up the use of force.

Today's Taiwan newspapers also published a speech yesterday by Chang Chun, "Secretary-General of the Presidential Office" of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, calling on Taiwan Kuomintang members to "understand" Chiang Kai-shek's "inner pain and suffering," and "understand how he endures humiliation and bears heavy burdens," and "overcome numerous difficulties." Chang Chun also quoted Chiang Kai-shek's often-repeated words: "Drinking ice water in cold weather, every drop is in the heart." Chang Chun said that Chiang Kai-shek "does not not know that ice water in cold weather is very cold, but he just keeps it in his heart."

Chang Chun made these remarks while "celebrating" Chiang Kai-shek's seventy-second birthday. In his speech, Chang Chun also admitted that for more than 30 years, Chiang Kai-shek "encountered particularly many difficulties, even to the point that they were beyond what ordinary people could endure or bear."

    戳穿了美国所谓不使用武力的把戏
    蒋介石叫嚷反共不离军事
    新华社31日讯　台北消息：台湾各报今天都以重要篇幅登载了蒋介石的一篇文告，他在这篇文告中叫嚷要“完成反共复国的任务”必须“使军事与政治并重”，既要“凭借政治”，也要“凭借军事”。
    蒋介石在这篇为台湾的“青年反共救国团”成立六周年发表的文告中说：“我曾说过‘三分军事，七分政治’的话，这句话在今天仍然是适用的。”
    所谓“三分军事，七分政治”是蒋介石在长期反人民内战中提出的口号。
    蒋介石这篇文告是在美国当局一再吹嘘美国已经取得了蒋介石“不使用武力”的“保证”之后发表的。在蒋杜会谈公报发表以后，台湾当局的负责人员已经一再声明台湾当局不准备放弃使用武力。
    在今天的台湾报纸上，同时还刊登了蒋介石集团“总统府秘书长”张群昨天的一篇讲话，呼吁台湾国民党人士“体谅”蒋介石“内心的沉痛与苦楚”，“体会他如何忍辱负重”，“克服重重的难关”。张群还引用蒋介石常说的话：“寒天饮冰水，点滴在心头”，张群说，蒋介石“并不是不知道寒天冰水是很冷的，但是他只是放在心头”。
    张群是在给蒋介石七十二岁生日“祝寿”时讲这番话的。张群在讲话里并且承认，三十多年来蒋介石“所遭遇的困难是特别的多，甚至有非常人所能忍、所能受的”。
