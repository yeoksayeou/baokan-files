    Firelight Illuminates the Ocean
    ——Sketches from the Fujian Front, Part Two
    Liu Baiyu

    Here, I record a magnificent scene of firelight that I saw on the most forward coastline.

    I often read the phrase "the ends of the earth" in books, but today I have truly reached one of our sea corners, which is Weitou, the tip of the arc-shaped position on the left wing surrounding the Jinmen Islands. It extends deeply into the sea, surrounded by ocean on three sides. Every night, the howling sea breeze and surging waves assault it from all directions, making you feel as if you are on a sea cliff. But it is a position wedged into the side and rear of Greater Jinmen Island, a position that makes the enemy tremble with fear. Fierce and concentrated artillery battles frequently take place here.

    It was a day of intense artillery fire. As dusk approached, the jeep I was in was speeding over a mountain ridge. At this moment, a truck drove in from the front lines. The two vehicles honked twice and stopped abruptly together. The two drivers chatted intimately by the window. It turned out that we had reached our destination. We entered a courtyard and immediately found ourselves among a group of naval comrades in blue uniforms. This was the forward first-aid station of the coastal artillery. There was a Christmas tree in the courtyard, usually planted in flowerpots in the north, but here it was more than ten feet tall, with the leaves on top already red. There was also a phoenix tree, which does not grow in the north. When this tree blooms, it looks like a red cloud. Under the corridor, a basin of charcoal fire was burning, and a box of medical instruments was being boiled on top. A wounded soldier, who had been injured by a shell this afternoon, was lying on a stretcher, surrounded by a group of people in white coats, solemn and dignified. People were shining a flashlight on his head, performing surgery. People told me: This is an ordinary militiaman who was on sentry duty on the coastline. I went to the front porch upstairs, and people told me: The front is Weitou, where shells frequently fly and explode. I saw a patch of emerald green sea to the right. Several rumbles of artillery fire rolled dully across the sea. But the sky flashed with the last rays of the sunset, and the sea lit up like a flame for a moment, then dimmed. The sea breeze swept onto the roof at this moment, patting the doors and windows. A young naval soldier wearing a blue cape lit a small kerosene lamp for me. People accustomed to electric lights may think the light of a kerosene lamp is dim and faint! But at the front lines, this golden flame evoked such a bright and warm feeling in my heart. I was worried about the fate of the injured person downstairs. In between my conversation with the two coastal artillery officers, I ran to the window to take a look. The lights in the corridor below were brightly lit, and the stretcher had been moved to the rear. However, when the surgery was being performed just now, this ordinary militiaman from Weitou lay quietly on the stretcher, like a person sound asleep. That resolute expression left a deep impression on me, as if he was saying to me: Look! This is the spirit of our Weitou front.

    Of course, talking about the spirit of the Weitou front is worth writing a huge book about, and I think the person who writes this book will be the happiest person. But I feel that at this moment, when the cannons are shaking the heavens and the earth, and the flashes of artillery fire are shining on the faces of people all over the world, bringing hope to those who are fighting in the forests and fields for beautiful ideals such as freedom and liberation, and sending the death knell to those who are making a last-ditch effort in the dark caves of Wall Street, at this moment, let the people of the Weitou front stand immediately before everyone!

    In the morning, the sea was blue-steel colored, the fog still covered the opposite islands, and a damp, cool breeze gently blew from the sea, making the sea so gentle and calm, waiting for the first joyous sunlight. As I walked all over the artillery positions on this coastline, past those heroic coastal cannons, past those soldiers who were brighter and more transparent than flames, I wanted to tell the sea: The first joyous sunlight is right here.

    When the soldiers sit in front of you, they are so innocent, shy, and a youthful smile is always on the corner of their mouths. Once they take action, their sense of pride shines like the sun, just like the poem they pasted on their beloved artillery position:

    A chest that can hold the ocean,
    Fighting spirit higher than a hundred-foot wave,
    A stomp of the feet and the Dragon Palace collapses,
    Stretch out a giant palm to hold the sun,
    Born with a hero's courage,
    A loyal heart to protect the sea frontier,
    Whoever dares to defile the Eastern Sea,
    Will meet the Dragon King at the bottom of the sea.

    It is they who are protecting the land of the motherland, protecting the ocean of the motherland, fiercely and accurately pouring groups of shells onto the artillery positions of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, causing the shells to burst into soaring firelight. This is the firelight of justice.

    However, the firelight that illuminates the ocean that I want to talk about here is not the flash of artillery fire, but another kind of firelight. One dark night, I walked from the artillery position in front of Weitou to the foremost reef on this sea corner. I stopped. The sea was at my feet, but the tide had not yet surged up, and the seawater was calmly flashing with a dim light. At this moment, I faced the sea breeze and looked forward. Ten thousand stars twinkled, the ocean was boundless. Now the sound of artillery had died down, but during the day on this sea surface, sometimes tens of thousands of shells intertwined like ten thousand golden lights. I turned around, and suddenly a strange light attracted me. Considering the strict control of lights in the forward positions, this light was so amazing. They were burning so openly and freely on the coast, illuminating half the night sky and reddening a piece of the sea. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the blazing flames from the groups of indigenous iron smelting furnaces. The flames were like a sea of fire, dancing, roaring, galloping, jumping...

    I remembered when I came, I saw the endless stream of people carrying iron sand from the coast, pushing iron sand. For thousands of years, the tides have pushed countless tons of pure iron sand onto the beaches every day and night. The battle to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu and the battle for steel have intertwined the steel army and the fighting troops firing artillery to attack the enemy on this forward position of Weitou. The previous night, I had been to that group of indigenous furnaces. The flames were dancing at the furnace mouths, the fire was roaring in the sea breeze, and thousands of sparks were flying in the air. Under the firelight, there were red flags everywhere, and people smelting iron everywhere. After winning a furnace of iron smelting, people were twisting the yangko dance and singing songs in the red-hot flashing light of molten iron. At that time, standing under that firelight, I really couldn't tell clearly: was the fire brighter than people, or were people brighter than the fire?

    But what is very meaningful is that in the flames of steelmaking and ironmaking on this seaside front position, there are also some raw materials sent by Eisenhower and Dulles, which are the broken pieces of shells that fell on our ground. On the Fujian front positions, now, after a day of artillery fire, the next day at dawn, it is clean, without even a bit of shell fragments. Our artillery not only fires artillery, but also launches a competition to pick up shell fragments. That day, in the hazy morning fog, I went to the coastal artillery position and saw several soldiers smilingly carrying back several baskets of shell fragments. I asked: It turned out that they had just finished picking up the shell fragments by the moonlight before dawn. In their area, 14,935 catties were picked up before October, and 12,000 catties have been picked up again since October. They sent all these steel pieces to the county for steelmaking. The masses of Weitou are even more active. As soon as the shell fragments land, they pick them up before they even cool down. Even the driver comrade who accompanied me from Xiamen through Quanzhou to Weitou brought back dozens of catties of steel fragments during the few days he stayed on the front lines! This incident not only shows that Eisenhower and Dulles "lost both the lady and the army," but it also proves a fearless pride in our people. Armament determinists always think that shells can scare people, but shells here encounter people who are even stronger than them, and shells become objects of ridicule. When I gathered with a group of young male and female militiamen in Weitou Village, they sang me such a song:

    The Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers are all fools,
    Using artillery to hit big sweet potatoes,
    If you fire a few more shells like this,
    You'll save digging deep when planting next year.

    The artillery soldiers wrote the following verses on the walls of their artillery fortifications:

    The Jinmen Chiang Kai-shek troops are making a blind fuss,
    Shooting artillery aimlessly without a target,
    Sending quite a lot of steel,
    The comrades laugh when they see it.

    Please see, isn't this kind of pride as high and strong as the flames that redden the sea in the darkness?

    Of course, I know that the firelight I saw is rising from the entire ground of our motherland. It reminds me of the firelight first seen in the early dawn of mankind, but today, it is more sacred than all firelight, because it is the firelight of the communist dawn. The great "Communist Manifesto" began to light it, and now it shines on the boundless and vast ground. This is a light more brilliant than the dawn, a light more intense than the sun, a light more fascinating than the colorful aurora borealis. Because, look! What is galloping and flashing is not just the flame of iron, the flame of steel, but more importantly, the flame of people. At this moment, I want to tell you something deeply engraved in my heart that I will never forget, which is the performance of An Yemin, a crystal-clear hero and artillery aimer, in the war on the Weitou position. He was severely burned in the artillery battle, and only one eye was left with a slit to see a little bit, but he put out the burning flames and still sat in the aiming position, refusing to leave his post no matter what, and continued to persist until the final victory of the artillery battle. He was sent to the hospital, and he was running a high fever, unconscious on the bed. But the nurse guarding him still heard him say: "Report to the artillery commander! The artillery has been wiped clean, please ask the company, can we shoot now?" The nurse couldn't help but burst into tears, but with tears in her eyes, she said to him: "Comrade An Yemin! You wiped it very well! Now I order you to rest!" So this soldier didn't say anything more, and fell asleep peacefully. Please think about it! This is our people, people who can be knocked and sound like steel, socialist people. It is they who, under the guidance of that red flag of the Party fluttering in the wind, on the forefront of the battle, on the forefront of construction, it is they who want fire to take fire, want steel to refine steel, and it is from their hearts that this magnificent firelight radiates. Standing on the foremost coastline of Weitou, I felt great happiness and warmth, because from here I saw our entire glittering land, which will redden the ocean and redden the world.

    火光照红海洋
    ——福建前线速写之二
    刘白羽
    在这里，我记述我在最前沿海岸线上，看到一种壮丽的火光的景象。
    从前在书本里常常读到“天涯海角”这个句子，今天，我却真的到了我们的一个海角，这就是包围着金门群岛的左翼弧形阵地尖端上的围头。它深深伸入海内，三面都是海洋，每至夜晚，狂啸的海风与澎湃的海涛从几面袭来，使你恍若置身于海上悬崖。但它是一处楔入大金门岛侧后方的阵地，是一处让敌人胆战心寒的阵地，双方炮火经常在这儿猛烈地、集中地搏斗着。
    这是激烈炮战的一日，天近黄昏，我所坐的吉普车正逾过一个山岭向前奔驶，这时从前线方向驶来一辆卡车，双方鸣了两声喇叭，两车划然停在一起，两个司机同志就对着窗口亲切交谈起来。原来我们已经到了目的地，走进一个院落，立刻投身到一群着蓝色军服的海军同志中间，这是海岸炮兵的前线包扎所。院中有一株圣诞树，在北方栽在花盆里，这儿却是长得丈余高，顶上的叶子已经红了。还有一株在北方不生长的凤凰树，这种树开起花像一片红霞。走廊下，烧了盆炭火，上面煮着一箱医疗器具，一个今天下午刚受炮弹击伤的伤员躺在担架上，被一群穿白罩衫的人围着，肃静、庄严，人们用手电筒照着头部，正在动手术。人们告诉我：这是在海岸线上放哨的一个普通的民兵，我到楼上的前廊，人们告诉我：前面就是围头，炮弹经常在那儿纷飞爆炸。我望见右面有一片碧绿的海洋，几声轰隆隆的炮声，沉闷的在海面上滚动着。可是天空闪现出最后的晚霞，海像火焰一样亮了一下，随即昏暗下来。海风就在这时卷上屋顶，拍着门窗了。一个披着蓝色披巾的年青的海军战士为我点燃了一盏小小的煤油灯。照惯电灯的人也许觉得煤油灯光昏黄如豆吧！但在前线，这金黄色的光焰在我心里，却唤起那样明亮而又那样温暖的一种感情。我担心着楼下那一个伤者的命运；在我和两位海岸炮兵部队军官谈话中间，我又跑到窗前看了看，下面走廊上的灯光雪亮，担架已转往后方。不过刚才动手术时，围头的这一个普通民兵，安静静地躺在担架上，就像一个睡熟的人一样，那种坚毅的神情，给我留下深刻印象，它好像对我表示：看吧！这就是我们围头前线的精神。
    当然哪，讲到围头前线的精神，这是值得专门写一部巨大的书的，而且我认为写这部书的人将是最幸福的人。可是我觉得：在这样时刻，当大炮正在震撼着天地，炮火的闪光正在全世界人民的面孔上闪亮着，它为那些在灾难的土地上，为自由、解放等美好理想而在森林中，原野上，奋战的人们带去希望，它为那些在华尔街阴暗的洞窟里，妄图最后挣扎的人们传去送丧的钟声，在这样时刻，还是让围头前线的人立刻站在所有人的面前吧！
    早晨，海是蓝钢色的，雾还蒙着对面的海岛，一阵潮湿的清凉的风从海面上拂拂吹来，海变得如此温柔平静，它等待着第一线欢乐的阳光。当我走遍这海岸上的炮兵阵地，走过那一座座神勇的海岸大炮，走过那一个个比火苗还要通明透亮的战士时，我要告诉大海：第一线欢乐的阳光就在这里。
    战士们坐在你面前时，他们是那样天真，腼腆、那样一种年青的笑容总挂在嘴角边，他一旦行动起来，他们的自豪心却如太阳一样闪光，正像他们贴在自己亲爱的炮阵地上的这首诗一样：
    胸襟能够盛海洋，
    斗志高过百尺浪，
    双脚一跺龙宫倒，
    伸出巨掌托太阳，
    生成一颗英雄胆，
    赤胆忠心保海疆，
    谁敢沾污东海水，
    叫它海底见龙王。
    就是他们，保卫着祖国的土地，保卫着祖国的海洋，勇猛地，准确地把一群一群炮弹倾倒在蒋军炮阵地上，使炮弹迸射出冲天的火光。这是正义的火光。
    不过，我这里想讲的照红海洋的火光倒并不是炮火的闪光，而是另一种火光。一个黑夜，我从围头前面的炮阵地上走到这个海角最前面的礁石上，我站住了，我的脚下就是海，不过海潮尚未汹涌上来，海水是平静地闪着一片暗光，这时我迎着海风，向前了望，万星闪烁，海洋辽阔无边，现在炮声冷落了，但白天就在这海面上，有时千万发炮弹就如万道金光交织起来，我回转身，突然一种稀奇的光芒吸引了我，从前沿阵地严格管制灯火的环境看来，这光芒如此惊人，它们就那样公开地自由地在海岸上燃烧着，照亮半个夜空，也照红一片大海。仔细一看，原来是炼铁的土炉群发出来的熊熊火焰，那火焰像一片火海，在舞蹈，在鸣啸，在奔腾，在跳跃，………
    我记起在来时，看到路边上那络绎不绝的从海岸上挑着铁沙，推着铁沙的人群，海潮千万年来每天每夜把无数吨纯净的铁沙推送到海滩上来。为解放台、澎、金、马而战与为钢而战，使得为钢铁大军和发射炮火攻击敌人的战斗部队就在这围头前沿阵地上交织在一起了。我在前一个夜晚曾经到那土炉群那儿去过，那儿火焰在炉口跳荡，火在海风中呼呼叫啸，千万火星在空中飞舞，火光下，到处是红旗，到处是炼铁的人，人们在取得一炉炼铁胜利后，就在铁水的通红闪光中，扭着秧歌、唱着歌。当时，我站在那火光之下，我真无法分辨清楚：是火比人亮，还是人比火亮。
    但是十分有意义的，是这海边前沿阵地炼钢炼铁的火焰中，也还有艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯们送来的一部分原料，这就是落在我们地面上的碎弹片。在福建前线阵地上，现在，炮战一日，第二天天亮一看，干干净净，连一点碎弹片渣子都没有了。我们的炮兵不但管打炮，而且还展开了拾弹片的竞赛。那天，早雾迷蒙中，我到岸炮阵地上去，就瞧见几个战士笑呵呵地把几筐弹片背了回来；我一问：原来他们趁着黎明前的月光刚拾完弹片回来。他们这一片阵地上，10月前拾了一万四千九百三十五斤，10月后已经又拾了一万二千斤了。这些钢片，他们都送给县里炼钢去了。而围头的群众更是积极，弹片落地，有时还没等它冷却就已拾了起来。就连陪同我从厦门经泉州驶到围头来的驾驶员同志在前线耽搁的几天也带回几十斤钢铁的碎片呢！这件事还不仅说明艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯“赔了夫人又折兵”，而且它证明我们的人的一种无畏的自豪。唯武器论者总以为炮弹能吓人，但是，炮弹在这儿遇到比他还强烈的人，炮弹变为被嘲笑的对象。当我和围头村一群男女青年民兵聚集在一起时，他们给我唱出了这样的歌子：
    蒋军官兵净傻瓜，
    用炮光打大地瓜
    像这样炮弹多打几炮
    明年下种省深挖
    炮兵战士则在自己炮工事的墙壁上写下这样的诗句：
    金门蒋军瞎胡闹，
    没有目标乱打炮，
    钢铁送来真不少，
    同志们见了哈哈笑，
    请看，这种自豪心不就像这黑夜间照红大海的火焰一样高、一样旺吗？
    当然，我知道我所见的火光是从我们祖国整个地面上升起的。它使我想起人类黎明时期最初望见的火光，但今天，比一切火光都神圣，因为它是共产主义黎明的火光。伟大的“共产党宣言”开始点燃了它，而它现在在无边广阔的地面上发光了，这是比早霞还灿烂的光，这是比太阳还强烈的光，这是比彩色缤纷的北极光还引人入胜的光。因为，你看！它，那奔腾、闪烁的不仅仅是铁的火焰，钢的火焰，而更重要的是人的火焰。在这时，我想讲出深深刻在我心里而永远不能忘记的一件事，这就是围头阵地上的一个晶光发亮的英雄，炮兵瞄准手安业民在战争中的表现。他在炮战中烧伤很重，只一只眼睛还露着一道缝能看到一点点，但他扑灭了燃烧的火焰，仍然坐到瞄准位置上说什么也不肯离开战位，继续坚持到炮战最后胜利。他送进医院了，他发着高烧，在病床上昏迷不醒。但是守着他的护士还听他在讲：“报告炮长！火炮擦拭完毕，请示连里，现在可以射击吗？”护士同志怎样也忍不住自己的热泪，可是她含着泪水对他说：“安业民同志！你们擦拭很好！现在命令你休息！”于是这个战士他就不再说什么，而安安静静地睡熟了。请想一想吧！这就是我们的人，像钢一样可以敲得铮铮响的人，社会主义的人。正是他们在那一面凌风飘动的党的红旗引导下，在战斗最前哨，在建设最前哨，正是他们要火取火、要钢炼钢，正是从他们心里放射出这壮丽的火光。我站在围头最前沿最前沿海岸线上，我感到巨大的幸福与温暖，因为从这儿我看到了我们整个闪闪发光的国土，它将要照红海洋也照红世界。
