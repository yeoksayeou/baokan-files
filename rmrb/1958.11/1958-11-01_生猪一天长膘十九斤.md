In the Shaanxi Pavilion, there are two photographs. One photograph shows an ordinary young pig weighing about forty or fifty jin. The other shows the same pig ten days later. The difference is that this pig is missing its ears and tail, but its body has more than doubled in size. This pig gained as much as nineteen jin in weight in one day.

This was a gift to celebrate National Day this year from the "Satellite Commando" team, composed of six students from the Animal Husbandry Department of Northwest Agricultural College. These "commando" members, in order to improve feed management methods, were not afraid of dirt and stench, moved into the pigsty, and lived with the pigs. Initially, they adopted the "three cuts" method created by the masses, cutting the pig's thyroid gland, ears, and tail. Later, they adopted the "four cuts" method, further cutting part of the pig's thymus, which greatly increased the pig's daily weight gain. According to their experiments, twenty pigs gained an average of six and a half jin each in five days, with one pig gaining a maximum of nineteen jin per day. (Attached picture)

Don't mind that I don't have ears and a short tail, I'm growing fatter than you!

    生猪一天长膘十九斤
    在陕西馆，有这样两张照片，一张照片上有一只约四、五十斤重的普通架子猪，另一张是十天以后的同一只猪，所不同的是，这头猪少掉了耳朵和尾巴，但身体却长大了一倍多。就是这一头猪，有一天竟增加体重十九斤。
    这是西北农学院畜牧系的六个学生组成的“卫星突击队”迎接今年国庆的献礼。这些“突击队”员为了改善饲料管理方法，不怕脏臭，搬进猪棚，和猪同住。他们最初采用群众创造的割猪的甲状腺、割猪耳和猪尾的“三割”办法，以后又采取“四割”办法，再割去猪的部分胸腺，使猪的日增重量大大提高。据他们试验，二十头猪在五天内平均每头增重六斤半，其中一头最高日增十九斤。（附图片）
    甭看我没耳朵，少尾巴，我长得却比你胖
