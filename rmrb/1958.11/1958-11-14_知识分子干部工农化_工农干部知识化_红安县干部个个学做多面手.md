Intellectual Cadres Become Workers and Peasants, Worker-Peasant Cadres Become Intellectuals
Hong'an County Cadres All Learn to Be Multitaskers

(Our Wuhan Dispatch) The vast number of cadres in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, on the basis of being both red and expert, are developing in the direction of "one person, many skills" and "one person, many uses," and have achieved remarkable results. This not only promotes the simultaneous advancement of various tasks throughout the county, but also greatly reduces the difference between manual and mental labor, thereby enabling intellectual cadres to become workers and peasants, and worker-peasant cadres to become intellectuals.

Hong'an County is famous throughout the country for planting experimental fields. Now, in this county, whether they are office cadres or rural cadres, leading cadres or ordinary cadres, almost everyone is an expert in agricultural production. After mastering agricultural technology, many cadres have actively learned other technologies. Now, many people have been praised as "five-personnel" cadres, "five-understand" cadres, and "five-capable" cadres. The so-called "five-personnel" are agricultural water conservancy technicians, livestock epidemic prevention personnel, fruit tree grafting personnel, propagandists, and accountants; the so-called "five-understand" are understanding soil structure, variety characteristics, plant protection, cultivation techniques, and cultivation system reform; the so-called "five-capable" are being able to produce, able to work, able to write articles, and able to invent and create. Since the large-scale iron and steel production, thanks to diligent study, most cadres have quickly mastered the entire set of technologies from building furnaces to producing iron. In this way, they are both state cadres and ordinary laborers, thereby making the relationship between cadres and the masses closer, and agricultural and industrial production is advancing towards a newer peak.

Due to the result of "one person, many skills" and "one person, many uses," this exciting situation has emerged: the boundary between intellectual cadres and worker-peasant cadres has narrowed, and many cadres from intellectual backgrounds, due to the practice of the past year, have greatly reduced their intellectual flavor and have begun to become workers and peasants; at the same time, many cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds have also begun to become intellectualized. For example, Pan Zhi, the Minister of Industry and Transportation of the County Party Committee, is a cadre from an intellectual background, but now he is not only familiar with the whole set of agricultural production knowledge, but also knows how to make steel, drive a car, and repair water pumps, and is therefore praised as a "both civil and military" cadre. According to statistics, among the more than 980 cadres in the county alone, more than half are multitasking like this. The masses praised and said: "The current cadres are learning something new with every step, changing every day."

The reason why Hong'an County has achieved great success in this regard is inseparable from the continuous strengthening of political and ideological work and the leading cadres taking the lead in setting an example. Since this county planted experimental fields, the Party organization, with the spirit of continuous revolution, has proposed to all cadres that on the basis of agricultural "five-knows," they should achieve "five-personnel," "five-understand," and "five-capable" in order to master more knowledge and adapt to the requirements of the great development of social production. The influence of leading cadres taking the lead in setting an example is also very great.

Planting all kinds of experimental fields is also a reason for the cadres of this county to quickly become multitaskers. Since this year, this county not only has experimental fields for crops, but also experimental fields for diversified operations, such as fruit trees, pig raising, and cattle raising. In addition, there are also experimental small blast furnaces, experimental reservoirs, and so on. These have become cadre learning positions, and they have quickly mastered the production skills in various fields.

### 知识分子干部工农化　工农干部知识化  红安县干部个个学做多面手

    知识分子干部工农化　工农干部知识化
    红安县干部个个学做多面手
    本报武汉讯　湖北省红安县广大干部在又红又专的基础上，正向“一人多艺”、“一员多用”多面手的方向发展，并已取得显著成就。这样，不仅促进了全县各项工作齐头并进，同时还大大缩小了体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别，从而使知识分子干部工农化和工农干部知识化。
    红安县是以种试验田而闻名全国的。现在，在这个县，无论是机关干部还是农村干部，也无论是领导干部还是一般干部，几乎个个都是农业生产的内行。许多干部在掌握了农业技术以后，又积极学习其他技术。现在，有不少人已被人们誉为是“五员”干部，“五懂”干部、“五能”干部。所谓“五员”，就是农业水利技术员，牲畜防疫员，果木嫁接员，宣传员，会计员；所谓“五懂”就是懂土壤结构，品种特性，植物保护，栽培技术，耕作制度改革；所谓“五能”，就是能生产，能工作，能写文章，能发明创造。自从大办钢铁以来，由于刻苦钻研，大部分干部又迅速地掌握了从建炉到出铁的全套技术。这样，就做到了既是国家干部，又是普通劳动者，从而使干群关系更加密切，工农业生产更迈向更新的高峰。
    由于“一人多艺”、“一员多用”的结果，就出现了这种令人兴奋的情况，知识分子干部同工农干部之间的界限缩小了，许多知识分子出身的干部，由于一年来的实践，知识分子味大大减少，开始工农化了；和这同时，许多工农出身的干部也开始知识化了。例如，县委工业交通部长潘知，是个知识分子出身的干部，但是，现在他不仅熟悉农业生产全套知识，还会炼钢铁，开汽车，修理抽水机，因而被人们誉为“能文能武”的干部。根据统计，全县仅在九百八十多名干部中，类似这样的多面手就有一半以上。群众赞扬地说：“现在的干部是一步一个窍，一天一个样”。
    红安县之所以在这方面获得了巨大成就，是与不断地加强政治思想工作，领导干部亲自带头作样子分不开的。自从这个县种试验田以后，党的组织即以不断革命的精神，向全体干部提出在农业“五会”的基础上，做到“五员”、“五懂”、“五能”，以便掌握更多的知识，适应社会生产大发展的要求。领导干部带头作样子的影响也很大。
    种各种各样的试验田，也是这个县的干部迅速成为多面手的一个原因。今年以来，这个县不仅有农作物的试验田，还有多种经营的试验田，例如果树、养猪、养牛等，此外，还有试验小高炉，试验水库等等。这些就成了干部学习阵地，很快地掌握了各方面的生产技能。
