Strengthening Political Work on Factory Night Shifts
Hua'an Machinery Factory's Party, Government, Labor Union, and Communist Youth League Establish Three-Shift System; Ideological and Living Problems of Night Shift Workers Resolved Promptly, Greatly Improving Production Efficiency

Qi Qihar, November 18th (This newspaper) – The state-owned Hua'an Machinery Factory has strengthened political and ideological work on night shifts, resulting in significant changes in the factory's night shift production and the ideological outlook of its employees.

This factory is a multi-shift enterprise, with more than half of its employees working in the second and third night shifts. In the past, political and ideological work was mainly conducted during the day shift, with no leadership at night. During the rectification campaign, workers criticized the leadership. Based on these opinions, the Party organization established a night office. Party committee members and responsible cadres from various departments organized a rotating duty leadership team to lead the factory's night shift work. Each workshop branch added two to three non-full-time deputy secretaries per shift, who took turns with the secretary to preside over political and ideological work. Party groups were divided according to shifts, and the administration, labor union, and Communist Youth League also established a three-shift work system.

Two problems were encountered in implementing this approach: one was the working hours of part-time cadres, and the other was the lack of experience of some cadres. They adopted methods such as master-apprentice training, holding training classes, and summarizing and introducing the work experience of part-time cadres, and within three months, these part-time cadres were basically qualified. These comrades mainly used their spare time to carry out ideological work. To facilitate the work of part-time Party and mass cadres, each part-time secretary was assigned a better apprentice. For example, Gu Xiangxian, the secretary of the Eleventh Workshop branch, when he left the lathe to do political work, he would just set up the workpiece, align the cutting tool, and ask his apprentice to watch over it, while he regularly checked on it. He now manages two planing machines with an apprentice, and can do Party work without being separated from production.

Strengthening political and ideological work on night shifts has enabled cadres to widely connect with the masses, further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the past, night shift workers could not often meet and contact with leaders, and leaders only saw the products and not the people during night production. Workers' ideological problems and opinions could not be dealt with and resolved in a timely manner. After strengthening political and ideological work on night shifts, cadres and workers labored together, solved problems together, and cared for and cherished each other. In one month, the cadres of the Tenth Workshop had more than five hundred conversations with workers, ensuring that opinions were resolved and problems were dealt with. Jin Daoxian, the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of this workshop, had talks with seventy young workers in more than twenty days, resolving the ideological problem of some young workers not being at ease with their work. Many production problems were also dealt with in a timely manner. In one month, cadres in the Second Workshop solved more than fifty major production problems on the night shift. In the past, the night shift workers' production efficiency in this factory was generally 15% lower than that of the day shift, but now the night shift's production efficiency is 30% higher than that of the day shift, and the number of quality and safety accidents has also been greatly reduced.

In order to eliminate the feeling of fatigue among workers during night work, the Party organization of this factory strengthened propaganda and mobilization work on night shifts, creating propaganda forms that were in line with the characteristics of night shifts. Each workshop has adopted more than ten forms of propaganda and mobilization, such as gongs and drums, clapper talk, shouting, sending congratulatory letters, political commander platforms, and reporting teams, to stimulate the morale of employees. Every one or two hours, each workshop broadcasts praise for advanced figures and carries out political and ideological education work amidst the sound of gongs and drums.

In addition, solving the problem of night shift workers getting a good sleep during the day is a major issue. The Party branch of this factory helped summarize and introduce experiences in getting a good sleep, such as "running" before going to bed and "counting" when sleeping, and assisted in adjusting the single dormitories, arranging the dormitories to be as dark as night when sleeping during the day. Employees with many children at home can move to the single dormitories to sleep. Education was also carried out among family members to ensure that their husbands get a good sleep, and children's teams were organized in concentrated dormitories to avoid affecting the sleep of night shift workers.

    加强工厂夜班的政治工作
    华安机械厂党政工团建立三班工作制夜班工人思想、生活问题及时解决，生产效率大大提高
    本报齐齐哈尔18日电　国营华安机械厂加强夜班的政治思想工作，使全厂夜班的生产和职工的思想面貌发生了重大变化。
    这个厂是个多班制的企业，半数以上的职工在夜间二、三班工作。过去党的政治思想工作主要是在白班，夜班无人领导。整风中工人们批评了领导。党组织根据这些意见，建立了夜间办公室。党委委员和部委的负责干部组织了轮流值班领导小组，领导全厂夜班工作。各车间支部都按班增设二至三名不脱产的副支书，同支书轮流主持政治思想工作。党的小组按班次划分，行政、工会、共青团也建立三班工作制。
    实行这种办法遇到了二个问题：一个是兼职干部的工作时间，一个是有些干部缺乏经验。他们采取了师傅带徒弟，举办训练班，总结介绍兼职干部工作经验等方法，在三个月内使这些兼职干部都基本上称职。这些同志主要是利用业余时间进行思想工作。为照顾兼职党群干部在工作上的方便，给每个兼职支书配上一名较好的徒工。如十一车间支部书记顾详显，当他离开车床作政治工作时，只要卡好活、对好刀，就叫徒弟看管，自己经常检查，他现在和一个徒弟看两台刨床，不脱产也能作党的工作。
    加强夜班政治思想工作以后，使干部广泛接触了群众，干群关系进一步密切了。过去夜班工作的工人不能经常同领导见面和接触，领导干部对夜间生产是见物不见人，工人有思想问题和意见得不到及时处理解决。夜班政治思想工作加强后，干部与工人同劳动，同解决问题，互相关心，互相体贴。十车间一个月的时间，领导干部同工人交谈五百多人次，做到了有意见就解决，有问题就处理。这个车间的团支部副书记金道贤在二十多天内同七十多名青年进行了谈话，解决了一些青年工人不安心工作的思想问题。许多生产中的问题也及时得到处理。二车间干部跟班一个月的时间就解决了夜班五十多个生产上的重大问题。过去这个厂的夜班工人生产效率一般比白班低15％，现在夜班生产效率比白班还提高30％，质量和安全事故也大大减少。
    这个厂的党组织为了消除工人夜间工作困倦的感觉，加强了夜班的宣传鼓动工作，创造出符合夜班特点的宣传形式。各车间都分别采用了锣鼓、快板、喊话、送贺信、政治挂帅台、报喜队等十多种宣传鼓动形式来激励职工情绪。各车间每隔一两小时就在锣鼓声中广播表扬先进人物和进行政治思想教育工作。
    此外，解决夜班工人白天睡好觉的问题是一件大事。这个厂的党支部帮助总结介绍了睡觉前“跑步”，睡觉时“查数”等睡好觉的经验，并协助调整了单身宿舍，把宿舍布置得在白天睡觉时也像夜间一样。家中小孩多的职工可搬到单身宿舍去睡。在家属中还进行保证丈夫睡好觉的教育，在集中居住的宿舍组织孩子队，以免影响夜班工人睡觉。
