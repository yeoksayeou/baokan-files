Vigorously Launch the Western Medicine Studying Chinese Medicine Movement
    On November 18th, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued an instruction on the summary report of the Party Group of the Ministry of Health regarding the organization of Western medicine practitioners leaving their posts to study Chinese medicine classes. This is a major event in China's medical and health undertakings. At a time when China's technological revolution and cultural revolution are reaching a climax, the issuance of this instruction by the Central Committee is of even greater significance. The Party has always attached great importance to China's national medical heritage and has repeatedly called on Chinese and Western medicine to unite and cooperate, jointly study, research, and organize the motherland's medical heritage, so that it can be continuously developed and serve the people better. This instruction once again emphasizes that China's national medical heritage is a great treasure house, and Western medical personnel must be organized to study it carefully and continue to work hard to explore and improve it. There is no doubt that the correct implementation of this important instruction will further push China's medical technology revolution movement to a climax and promote a comprehensive leap forward in China's health work to a new stage.
    Since the Party Central Committee corrected Comrade He Cheng's mistakes of discrimination and exclusion of Chinese medicine, the health department has made certain achievements in organizing Western medicine practitioners to study Chinese medicine in the past few years. In particular, after the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, the majority of medical and health personnel have generally improved politically and ideologically, the erroneous ideas of discrimination and exclusion of Chinese medicine have begun to be reversed, and the Party's Chinese medicine policy has been gradually implemented. Once the Party's policy is put into practice, it immediately becomes a huge force. It has not only greatly encouraged the vast number of Chinese medicine practitioners, further stimulated their enthusiasm to serve the people, and made them a strong force in China's people's health cause, but also among Western medical personnel, more and more people have gradually abandoned their bourgeois views of blindly worshiping Europe and the United States and despising the motherland's medical heritage, and actively responded to the Party's call to learn from Chinese medicine. At present, in addition to the six off-the-job training courses organized by the Ministry of Health, many provinces and cities have also set up schools and short-term training courses for Western medicine to study Chinese medicine; many medical colleges have also added Chinese medicine courses; and many hospitals and medical research institutions have also organized on-the-job Western medicine to study Chinese medicine. Individual regions have already formed a upsurge of Western medicine learning Chinese medicine. Many Western medicine practitioners across the country have initially mastered the knowledge of Chinese medicine and learned to use Chinese medicine to treat diseases for the people. This is a very good phenomenon. Facts have proved that as long as we earnestly strengthen the ideological education of Western medical personnel and actively organize Western medicine to learn from Chinese medicine, so that they can master some knowledge and technology of Chinese medicine, they will naturally experience that Chinese medicine can not only cure general diseases, but also cure some difficult and complicated diseases that cannot be treated by today's Western medicine, thus generating great interest in Chinese medicine. Prejudices also disappear. Therefore, only by earnestly organizing Western medicine to study Chinese medicine can we effectively shatter the various fallacies of the bourgeoisie that negate Chinese medicine, produce true unity between Chinese and Western medicine, and enable China's medical treasure house to be effectively explored, promote the convergence of Chinese and Western medical science, generate new theories, and produce new and more advanced socialist new medicine in China. This is why the Party has repeatedly emphasized the need to organize Western medicine to study Chinese medicine, and has repeatedly pointed out that the key to correctly implementing the Party's Chinese medicine policy is Western medicine studying Chinese medicine.
    Therefore, all localities must conscientiously implement the Party Central Committee's instructions on organizing Western medicine to study Chinese medicine. All regions with conditions should immediately start to run a study class for Western medicine practitioners to leave their posts to study Chinese medicine; all medical colleges should, without exception, quickly add Chinese medicine courses; all hospitals and medical research institutions should, without exception, actively organize Western medicine to study Chinese medicine in their spare time. Whether it is off-the-job study or on-the-job study, strong spiritual and material support should be given, and they should be helped in time to solve the problems of teaching materials, teachers, and study time. Those with good academic performance should be given appropriate rewards, so as to gradually form a mass movement in the medical field for Western medicine to study Chinese medicine. If all localities can do this, there will be thousands of Western medicine practitioners leaving their posts to study Chinese medicine across the country, and tens of thousands of Western medicine practitioners and other medical and health personnel studying Chinese medicine on the job. If we continue to do this, after a few years, China's medical and health team, China's medical science and technology, and China's people's health cause will present a very rich and magnificent situation.
    At present, the conditions for launching a mass movement of Western medicine studying Chinese medicine on a national scale are fully available. After the rectification campaign, the political and ideological level of medical and health personnel across the country has generally improved; Western medicine studying Chinese medicine has achieved certain results and experience; and there are more and more examples of the miraculous effects of Chinese medicine in treating difficult and complicated diseases that are sufficient to convince people. All of these are favorable conditions for further developing the movement of Western medicine studying Chinese medicine. The attitude of excessively exaggerating the resistance of Western medicine, exaggerating the difficulties in the work, and thus losing confidence is completely unfounded. However, at the same time, it must also be seen that the obstacles we face still exist. Some bourgeois intellectuals are still continuing to spread the idea of national nihilism, saying that Chinese medicine is "unscientific" and that Western medicine studying Chinese medicine is "going backwards" and "looking backwards," and other fallacies. Many Western medical personnel, due to being influenced by bourgeois ideology for a long time, have not completely eliminated the view of emphasizing Western medicine and neglecting Chinese medicine, and still take a skeptical attitude towards the motherland's medicine. What is serious is that there are still a small number of health administrative leaders who still have the remnants of Comrade He Cheng's erroneous ideological influence of discriminating against Chinese medicine, and still hold a nonchalant or passive resistance attitude towards the Party's Chinese medicine policy. The existence of this situation is the main reason why the Party's Chinese medicine policy and the Party's instructions on Western medicine studying Chinese medicine have not yet been universally implemented.
    Obviously, the main question currently facing our medical field is whether to unite Chinese and Western medicine, actively inherit and develop the motherland's medical heritage, and serve socialist construction? Or to negate Chinese medicine, hinder the development of China's medical science, and create a situation where the Chinese people lack doctors and medicines? This is a sharp and irreconcilable struggle between two paths, a struggle between the path of socialist medical and health work and the path of capitalist medical and health work. Without victory on the ideological front, there will be no victory in work. It is impossible to thoroughly implement the Party's Chinese medicine policy without thoroughly eliminating the influence of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, while organizing Western medicine to study Chinese medicine, we must continue to wage a resolute struggle against the bourgeois ideas from all sides that discriminate against and exclude China's national medical heritage; we must also strengthen the propaganda and education work of the Party's policies in conjunction with actual examples, and constantly improve the policy and ideological level of medical and health personnel, so that they can consciously act actively under the instructions of the Party. It is impossible to fully implement this task without strong political and ideological leadership.
    Actively organizing Western medicine to study Chinese medicine is a serious political task at present. The historical lesson of health work in the past few years is that listening to the Party's instructions and implementing the Party's policies will definitely lead to victory in work. If we deviate from the Party's leadership, it will inevitably bring harm to the work. Party committees at all levels must firmly place health work under the leadership of the Party, so as to rapidly launch a large-scale mass movement of Western medicine studying Chinese medicine on a national scale and greatly push forward China's health cause.

### 大力开展西医学中医运动

    大力开展西医学中医运动
    11月18日中共中央发布了对卫生部党组关于组织西医离职学习中医班总结报告的批示，这是我国医药卫生事业中的一件大事。正当我国技术革命和文化革命走向高潮的今天，中央发布这一指示，其意义是更为重大的。党对于我国的民族医药遗产从来十分重视，曾经一再号召中西医团结合作，共同学习、研究和整理祖国的医药遗产，使它不断发扬光大，以便更好地为人民服务。这一指示，又一次地强调指出：我国的民族医学遗产是一个伟大的宝库，必须组织西医人员认真学习，继续努力加以发掘提高。毫无疑问，这一重要指示的正确实施，必将把我国的医药技术革命运动进一步推向高潮，把我国的卫生工作全面大跃进推向一个新的阶段。
    自从党中央纠正了贺诚同志歧视、排斥中医的错误之后，几年以来，卫生部门在组织西医学中医的工作上，是有一定成绩的。特别是经过整风运动和反右派斗争，广大医药卫生人员在政治上思想上普遍有了提高，歧视和排斥中医的错误思想开始扭转，党的中医政策才逐步得到贯彻。党的政策一经付诸实施，便立即变成了巨大的力量。不仅使广大中医药人员得到了极大的鼓舞，进一步发挥了他们为人民服务的热忱，成为我国人民保健事业中一支强有力的队伍，而且在西医人员中，也有愈来愈多的人逐步放弃了他们盲目崇拜欧美和鄙视祖国医药遗产的资产阶级观点，积极地响应党的号召，向中医学习。目前，除了卫生部重点举办的六个离职学习班之外，不少的省、市也举办了西医学习中医的学校和短期训练班；很多医学院校也增设了中医课程；不少的医院和医药研究机构也组织了在职西医学习中医。个别地区已经形成了西医学习中医的热潮。全国已有不少的西医初步掌握了中医的知识，学会了运用中医中药为人民治病。这是一个很好的现象。事实证明，只要认真地加强西医人员的思想教育，积极地组织西医向中医学习，使他们掌握到一部分中医药的知识和技术之后，他们很自然的就会体验到中医药不仅能够治好一般的疾病，而且能够治好一些为今天的西医所不能治疗的疑难大症，从而对中医产生极大兴趣。门户之见也随之消失。因此，只有认真地组织西医学中医，才能有力地粉碎资产阶级否定中医的各种谬论，产生出真正的中西医大团结；也才能使我国的医学宝库得到有效的发掘，促进中西医学术合流，产生新的理论，产生新的更高级的我国社会主义新医学。这就是党为什么一再强调要组织西医学习中医，一再指出正确贯彻党的中医政策的关键问题是西医学中医的原因。
    因此，各地必须认真地执行党中央关于组织西医学习中医的指示。一切有条件的地区均应立即着手举办一个西医离职学习中医的学习班；一切医学院校均应不例外地迅速增设中医课程；一切医院和医药研究机构均应不例外地利用业余时间积极地组织西医学习中医。无论离职学习和在职学习，均应给予精神上物质上大力的支持，及时地帮助他们解决教材问题、教师问题和学习的时间问题，对于学习成绩好的，要给予适当奖励，以便使西医学中医逐步形成医药界的一个群众运动。各地如果都能够这样作了，全国就将有几千名西医离职学中医，有几万名西医和其他各种医药卫生人员在职学中医。这样作下去，几年之后，我国的医药卫生队伍，我国的医药科学技术，我国的人民保健事业，将会出现一个十分丰富多彩和雄伟壮观的局面。
    目前，在全国范围掀起一个群众性的西医学习中医运动，条件是完全具备的。经过整风以后，全国医药卫生人员的政治思想水平普遍有所提高；西医学中医已经取得了一定的成绩和经验；足以说服人心的中医治疗疑难病症的奇功特效的事例也愈来愈多地出现着。所有这些，都是进一步开展西医学习中医运动的有利条件。过分地夸大了西医的抵抗情绪，夸大了工作中的困难，因而失去信心的态度，是丝毫没有根据的。但是，同时也还必须看到，我们面前的障碍仍然是存在的。某些资产阶级知识分子，仍然继续在散布民族虚无主义思想，说什么中医“不科学”，西医学习中医是“开倒车”、“向后看”等等谬论。不少西医人员由于长期受到资产阶级的思想影响，重西轻中的观点尚未得到彻底清除，对于祖国医学仍然采取了怀疑的态度。严重的是还有少数卫生行政领导干部，至今还残存着贺诚同志那种歧视中医的错误思想影响，对于党的中医政策仍然抱着等闲视之或消极抵抗的态度。这种情况的存在，正是党的中医政策、党的西医学习中医的指示，至今还不能普遍得到贯彻的主要原因。
    很明显，当前摆在我们医药界面前的主要问题，是团结中西医，积极继承和发扬祖国医学遗产，为社会主义建设服务呢？还是否定中医，阻止我国医学科学发展，造成我国人民少医缺药的状况呢？这是针锋相对、互不相容的两条道路的斗争，是社会主义医药卫生工作道路和资本主义医药卫生工作道路的斗争。没有思想战线上的胜利，就决不会有工作上的胜利。不能彻底肃清资产阶级思想的影响，党的中医政策彻底贯彻是不可能的。因此，在组织西医学习中医的同时，必须继续对那种来自各方面的歧视和排斥我国民族医药遗产的资产阶级思想进行坚决的斗争；还必须结合实际事例，加强党的政策的宣传教育工作，不断提高医药卫生人员的政策思想水平，使他们能够自觉地在党的指示下积极行动起来。没有强有力的政治思想领导是不可能完满地实行这一任务的。
    积极地组织西医学习中医，是当前的一项严重的政治任务。几年以来，卫生工作的历史教训是，听从党的指示，执行党的政策，工作上就一定得到胜利，如果脱离党的领导，就必然给工作带来危害。各级党委必须把卫生工作紧紧地放在党的领导之下，以便迅速地在全国范围开展一个大规模的西医学中医的群众运动，把我国的卫生事业大大地向前推进一步。
