Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, 23rd. At 22:00 on the 22nd, the main stream of Sanmenxia – the Shenmen River – was cut off seven days ahead of schedule.

The Shenmen River is sixty meters wide. Before the cutoff, its maximum flow velocity was 6.86 meters per second, and the maximum drop reached 2.74 meters. At the time of the cutoff, the water flow of Sanmenxia was 1,810 cubic meters per second. However, the heroic workers who made the river give way used less than three days from the official start of the cutoff to 22:00 on the 22nd to subdue the Shenmen River. Achieving a cutoff victory in such a short time under such a large flow velocity and drop is rare in the world.

Cutting off the Shenmen River is the first battle of the entire Sanmenxia cutoff project. Next, the second battle of the cutoff project - cutting off the Shenmen spillway - will begin. After the Shenmen spillway is cut off, it will immediately turn to the final battle of the cutoff - closing the gates of the Guimen spillway bridge.

According to the general负责人 [responsible person] of the Sanmenxia cutoff project, the speed at which the Shenmen River was cut off indicates that the completion time of the entire Sanmenxia cutoff project will be greatly advanced compared to the original plan.

    三门峡截流初战告捷
    提前七天截断神门河
    新华社三门峡23日电　22日22时，三门峡的主流——神门河提前七天被截断了。
    神门河宽六十公尺。在截流之前，它的最高流速是六点八六秒公尺，落差最高达到二点七四公尺。在截流的时候，三门峡的水流量是一千八百一十秒公方。但是叫河水让路的英雄的职工们，从正式截流开始到22日22时为止，总共用了不到三天的时间，就把神门河制服了。用这样短的时间在这样大的流速和落差情况下取得截流的胜利，在世界上是少有的。
    截断神门河是三门峡整个截流工程的第一个战役。接着，截流的第二战役——截断神门溢流道的工程就要开始。神门溢流道断流以后，将立即转入截流的最后战役——关闭鬼门溢流桥的闸门。
    据三门峡截流工程总负责人谈，神门河断流的速度表明，整个三门峡截流工程的完工时间，将比原定计划大大提前。
