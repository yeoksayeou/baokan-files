Vigorously Promote “Four-Localizations”
Abstract of a *Shanxi Daily* Editorial

The "Four-Localizations" proposed by the Changzhi Special District is the clarion call for a large-scale technical revolution movement in the countryside and an inevitable trend of the whole party and the entire people engaging in steelmaking. This movement will enable the mechanization and electrification of the countryside to come sooner and faster; it will, in a blink of an eye, liberate a large number of strong laborers in the countryside; and it will create conditions for eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas in terms of labor conditions, production scale, production efficiency, and people's material lifestyles, and create conditions for a gradual transition to a communist society.

The bumper harvest of steel is the victorious fruit of the whole party and the entire people making steel. Taking steelmaking as an example, it is a result. However, in terms of the Party's strategy in the new historical period—the task of technical revolution—it is a new starting point. With a considerable amount of steel, there will be a major material basis for carrying out the technical revolution, and it will be possible to build machines, build motors, and repair railways on a large scale. To this end, on the one hand, we must vigorously grasp the machinery industry to quickly turn the smelted steel into machines and put them into production. On the other hand, we must quickly apply the experience of small-scale indigenous steelmaking to other industries, truly making small-scale indigenous methods a complete industrial chain. That is, using the steel smelted by small-scale indigenous methods to build railways, machine tools, machinery, and motors using small-scale indigenous methods. In this way, walking on two legs (large-scale foreign methods and small-scale indigenous methods) can greatly accelerate the pace of rural mechanization and electrification.

Large and small, indigenous and foreign, are two aspects of a unified thing. In steelmaking, there are large-scale foreign methods and small-scale indigenous methods. Building railways, manufacturing machines, manufacturing machine tools, and manufacturing motors also have large-scale foreign methods on one hand and small-scale indigenous methods on the other. The distinction between large and small, indigenous and foreign, will exist at all times. Of course, this does not mean that the current indigenous and small-scale should remain unchanged. Rather, it means that whether large, small, indigenous, or foreign, they must exist in continuous development and continuous improvement. New things always grow from small to large, from low-level to high-level, so the seeds of new things often emerge from small and indigenous sources. Like the current indigenous railways, indigenous machinery, indigenous motors, and indigenous machine tools, they are indeed both indigenous and small, but they have unlimited vitality. Before long, the indigenous can become foreign, and the small can become large, to the point of keeping pace with the existing large-scale foreign methods. At this time, new creations appear in actual life, and there are new small and indigenous methods; or the existing large-scale foreign methods adopt new scientific and technological achievements, and large, small, indigenous, and foreign have distinctions under new conditions. Moreover, whether large and foreign or small and indigenous, they cannot be separated from the "masses"; without the "masses," there can be no leap forward.

Steelmaking and manufacturing machinery and equipment are two closely linked links. We Communists, to complete the strategic task of the new historical period—the task of technical revolution—must not only smelt steel but also turn steel into the machinery and equipment we need. This task can only be accomplished by relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses. (Attached picture)

    大闹“四土化”
    山西日报社论摘要
    长治专区提出的“四土化”，这是农村大规模的技术革命运动的号角，是全党全民大炼钢铁的必然趋势。这个运动，将使农村机械化、电气化来得更快更早；将要在转瞬之间，解放农村的大批强壮劳力；并为在劳动条件、生产规模、生产效率及人民物质生活方式方面，消除城市与乡村的差别创造条件，为逐步过渡到共产主义社会创造条件。
    钢铁大丰收，是全党全民炼钢铁的胜利果实。以炼钢铁说，它是结果，但以党在新的历史时期的战略——技术革命的任务来说，它又是一个新的起点。有了相当数量的钢铁，就有了进行技术革命的主要物质基础，就可以大造机器，大造电机，大修铁路。为此，一方面要大抓机械工业，使已炼出的钢铁迅速变成机器投入生产；另一方面要把小土群炼钢铁的经验，迅速运用到其他工业上，真正使小土群成为一条龙。这就是运用小土群炼出的钢铁，再来个小土群修铁路，小土群造机床、造机械、造电机。这样用两条腿（大洋群和小土群）走路，便可大大加速农村机械化、电气化的步伐。
    大和小，土和洋，是统一事物的两个方面。炼钢铁，有大的、洋的，也有小的、土的；修铁路、造机器、造机床、造电机，也是一面有大的、洋的，一面有小的、土的。大、小、土、洋之分，在任何时候都会存在的。当然，这不是说现在的土的、小的要一成不变地存在下去，而是说不论大、小、土、洋，都要在不断发展、不断改进中存在下去。新事物都是从小到大，从低级到高级，所以新事物的萌芽，往往出之于小，出之于土。像现在的土铁路、土机械、土电机、土机床，确实是既土又小，然而它有无限的生命力。不要多久，土中即可出洋，小就可变大，以至和现有的大的、洋的并驾齐驱。这时，实际生活中又出现新的创造，则又有了小的、土的；或是现有的大的、洋的又采用新的科学技术成就，大、小、土、洋，又在新的条件下有了分别。而且不论大、洋也好，小、土也好，都不能离“群”，离开了“群”便不能跃进。
    炼钢铁和造机器设备，是两个紧相连结的环节，我们共产党人，要完成新的历史时期的战略任务——技术革命任务，就不仅要炼出钢铁，而且要把钢铁变成我们所需要的机械设备。这个任务只能是依靠群众发动群众来完成。（附图片）
