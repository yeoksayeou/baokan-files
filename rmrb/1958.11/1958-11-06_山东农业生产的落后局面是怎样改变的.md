How the Backward Situation in Shandong's Agricultural Production Was Changed
Tan Qilong, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Like all fraternal provinces and regions across the country, Shandong has achieved an unprecedented great leap forward in agricultural production this year. The total grain output is expected to reach about 80 billion jin, a 2.3-fold increase compared to last year; the total cotton output is expected to reach 12 million dan, more than triple that of last year; oilseeds, flue-cured tobacco, hemp, fruits, and other crops have also achieved unprecedented harvests. This is an astonishing miracle and a great victory in the history of Shandong's agricultural production.

This victory has brought about tremendous changes in the entire rural economy of Shandong. The biggest pressure on cadres and the masses over the years—the grain problem—has been basically solved this year. This has allowed us to begin to shift from a passive to an active position on the agricultural production front.

This victory has opened people's eyes, enabling everyone to more accurately grasp the potential for increased agricultural production and greatly liberate their minds. The clichés such as "Shandong is special," "more people than land, dry land in the north, low yields of miscellaneous grains," the "conditional theory," the "backward theory," and the "theory of limited agricultural production increase," have been completely shattered. It has laid a good foundation for a greater leap forward in agricultural production in the future.

This victory is a great encouragement to the people of the entire province. It has further consolidated the socialist position in the countryside, further promoted the improvement of people's ideological awareness and the further transformation of production relations, and greatly enhanced the confidence of cadres and the masses in building socialism ahead of schedule and gradually transitioning to communism.

Achieving this victory was not smooth sailing, nor was it accidental.

The unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production is first and foremost a victory for the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's general line for building socialism in Shandong, and a victory for the Shandong Party organization in resolutely implementing the rectification movement centered on opposing localism.

Reallocating Revolutionary Forces and Launching a Struggle Between Two Roads

In the Shandong Party organization over the past few years, there has been a struggle between two roads and two lines. Within the Provincial Party Committee itself, localist and rightist elements such as Wang Zhuoru (member of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and Deputy Governor) and Yuan Ziyang (member of the Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Governor) colluded together, taking localism, sectarianism, and decentralism as their manifestations, but essentially engaging in capitalism. They consistently and stubbornly opposed the correct principles and lines of the Party Central Committee and opposed the unified leadership of the Provincial Party Committee. On agricultural production and rural work, they were fierce promoters of regression. As early as the autumn of 1956, they seized on certain shortcomings in the production upsurge, raised the banner of opposing "rash advance," and launched a massive attack on the Provincial Party Committee. They said that the Provincial Party Committee "wanted to run to socialism too early," "made a big mistake," and "must conduct self-criticism." When formulating the agricultural production plan last autumn, they still opposed the leap forward plan proposed by the Provincial Party Committee with a right-leaning opportunist viewpoint, emphasizing this and that difficulty, citing classics to argue that agricultural production could only increase by a few percentage points, at most a dozen percentage points each year, satirizing the Provincial Party Committee as "daydreaming, burning all over, confused." And after their right-leaning views were initially criticized, another group of people appeared in a "leftist" guise last winter and launched vicious attacks on the Provincial Party Committee. They said: Before the autumn of 1956, the Provincial Party Committee was "left-leaning and rash," and after the autumn it was "right-leaning opportunism." They openly opposed Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, emphasizing class struggle and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, denying that contradictions among the people were the main ones, and even arrogantly said: If Chairman Mao knew the situation below, it might not be a "summer situation," but a "spring situation" instead. Whether these attacks came from the right or from the "left," their basic purpose was to create chaos and "overthrow" the Provincial Party Committee. In terms of intra-Party struggle, localist and right-leaning opportunist elements have always suspected and opposed the struggle carried out by the Provincial Party Committee following the instructions of the Central Committee to eliminate the influence of Xiang Ming's mistakes; they opposed the investigation and struggle against certain class dissidents and major counter-revolutionary suspects who had been hiding in the Party for a long time, and even openly protected them, saying that they were "old cadres" and "would not have problems." In terms of the relationship between the Party and the government, they emphasized the independence of the government without Party leadership, emphasizing the division of powers with the Provincial Party Committee. Rightist elements Wang Zhuoru, Yuan Ziyang and others even openly claimed to be "experts," saying that the Provincial Party Committee was an amateur, did not understand financial and economic matters, and "did not know the value of firewood and rice without managing the household." They organized sectarian cliques, established private warehouses, kept two sets of books, and openly resisted the Provincial Party Committee overtly and covertly. In short, the development of the situation became increasingly obvious, forming a situation in which localist, right-leaning opportunist elements and anti-Party rightist elements headed by Wang Zhuoru and Yuan Ziyang colluded together, echoed each other with people who shared their views among cadres at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, and went against the Provincial Party Committee. Therefore, the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee could not be truly implemented in the Provincial People's Committee and many regions. Obviously, this is the root cause of Shandong's backward situation in recent years. Without solving this problem, it would be just a dream to achieve a great leap forward in various tasks.

Based on this situation, for more than a year, we have consistently and resolutely implemented the rectification movement with the rectification as the general command, adopting the methods of "using the abstract to drive the concrete" and "discussing the abstract based on the concrete," and resolutely launched repeated and sharp struggles against localist, right-leaning opportunist elements, and all rightist elements inside and outside the Party, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee.

First, at the first Provincial Party Congress in the autumn of 1956, the Provincial Party Committee adhered to Party principles and struggled against the evil wind of anti-"rash advance" and anti-Provincial Party Committee. However, due to the immature conditions at the time, the Provincial Party Committee adopted a united approach in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, emphasizing mobilizing all positive factors to serve the construction of socialism, and only made appropriate criticisms of their mistakes. The purpose was to educate them and wait for them to become aware. However, they completely failed the Party's expectations of them. After the meeting, they not only did not examine their mistakes, but instead believed that this was a manifestation of the Provincial Party Committee's weakness, and thus became even more arrogant. In their work, they used a right-leaning opportunist viewpoint to pick faults everywhere, spread negative sentiment, or openly or secretly engaged in anti-Provincial Party Committee activities. Therefore, at the Provincial Socialist Construction Agricultural Activists Conference held last November, a fierce debate began. At the meeting, the Provincial Party Committee presented a leap forward plan and the key to increasing production centered on water, fertilizer, and soil, and at the same time proposed: "Relying on heaven for food, or transforming nature?" "Crawling, or leaping forward?" "Is production at its peak, or is there no limit to increasing production?" "Are natural disasters an obstacle, or a driving force?" "Does agriculture have great prospects, or does it have no prospects?" "Being the master of nature, or being a slave of nature?" Aiming at these six major differences, a fire was set, and everyone was organized to launch a great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters. This battle was well fought, and many labor models presented vivid facts, refuting and defeating the conservatives and promoters of regression from all aspects, achieving the first victory, and thus initially setting off a winter production upsurge. Shortly afterwards, at the Provincial Four-Level Cadre Conference, the anti-Party errors headed by Li Feng (First Secretary of Huimin Prefectural Party Committee) and Cao Liqin (Acting First Secretary of Tai'an Prefectural Party Committee) were more thoroughly criticized through great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, and disseminated and implemented throughout the province, improving the level of awareness of the entire Party. The Party began to unite, the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee could be initially implemented, and the Party, government, army, and people began to twist into a single rope, and the winter production upsurge further deepened. However, the problem was not completely resolved, and the leaders of localist and right-leaning opportunist elements were still hiding. Therefore, in general, Shandong's passive situation had not fundamentally changed. This spring, after several disseminations and implementations of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on the rectification movement, especially after the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, everyone's eyes became brighter. On the basis of the further improvement of the awareness of the entire Party, the rectification and supplementary education movement was universally and deeply carried out from the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat to various provincial-level departments, and organizations at the prefectural, county, township, and commune levels. In the movement, on the one hand, everyone presented facts, reasoned, analyzed and criticized through certain meetings, and combined the upper and lower levels, "using the abstract to drive the concrete"; on the other hand, through practical production actions, on-site meetings, visits and comparisons, etc., "discussing the abstract based on the concrete," the main cadres of the province, prefecture, county, township, and commune were planned to be concentrated in advanced working areas (such as Huang County and Shou Zhang), with living people facing living things, presenting a clear opposite side, two kinds of deeds, two kinds of thoughts, two kinds of people, launching a great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, everyone summarized experience, checked the reasons for backwardness. Such "combination of abstract and concrete" effectively promoted the in-depth development of the rectification movement and achieved great victories. In this fierce struggle, the localism, capitalist right-leaning opportunist elements in the Shandong Party, and the anti-Party rightist elements headed by Wang Zhuoru and Yuan Ziyang were centrally exposed and criticized. Organizations at all levels and various regions also mobilized the vast number of cadres and masses to insert red flags and remove white flags ideologically and organizationally, breaking the old and establishing the new. On the basis of solving ideological problems, organizations at all levels were rectified, and many departments and regions reallocated revolutionary forces. From the secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and members of the Standing Committee to cadres at the prefectural, county, township, commune, and team levels, nearly 40,000 cadres with white flags and gray flags were removed. The Heze Prefecture did a more thorough job, reversing nearly 20% of the county-level cadres. At the same time, various localities promoted a large number of activists to leading positions in the movement, greatly enhancing the Party's combat effectiveness. Now it seems that this was an inevitable struggle. Without winning this struggle and without reallocating revolutionary forces, it would be impossible to change the backward situation.

The in-depth development of the rectification movement has made the entire rural political landscape of Shandong take on a new look. The entire Party truly unified its thinking, the Party Central Committee's principles and lines and the Provincial Party Committee's instructions were smoothly implemented, the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and masses for building socialism was truly mobilized, red flags were raised everywhere, and work was in full swing, presenting a new situation of a great leap forward, thereby promoting the overall rapid development of the cause of socialist construction.

Judging from the situation in Shandong this year, the deeper and more thoroughly the rectification and the anti-localism struggle (essentially anti-capitalism) were carried out, the more vigorous various tasks were, and the greater the magnitude of the production leap forward. Conversely, it appeared backward. Heze Prefecture has always been the place with the lowest output in the province. This year, the rectification was carried out early and thoroughly, and the turnaround was the most thorough. Grain output jumped to the first place in the province. Everyone is very convinced of this fact. The facts of the past year have proven that the political ideology put forward by the Party Central Committee is the commander and soul of all work, and that "Marxism can produce grain" is an irrefutable truth. The facts have also proven that in whose hands the leadership is held is the key to whether the Party's principles and lines can be earnestly implemented, and also the key to whether the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of people in building socialism can be fully utilized, and whether agricultural production can be promoted to leap forward. This is the most profound point we have learned in agricultural production over the past year.

Improving Leadership Methods and Learning from Experiences of Other Places

On the basis of the rectification movement and the anti-localism struggle, earnestly changing the style of leadership, improving leadership methods, "grasping the advanced, promoting the backward," "breaking through the backward, oppressing the advanced," and always maintaining a humble attitude and learning from the advanced experiences of other places. This is another point that we have deeply realized in leading agricultural production this year.

In recent years, our province has been relatively passive in agricultural production, lagging behind fraternal provinces and regions. However, there are still many creations and advanced experiences among the masses. After the autumn of last year, we studied and analyzed this situation and believed that as long as advanced experiences were universally promoted throughout the province, Shandong's backward appearance could be greatly changed, and it was entirely conditional to achieve this step. At that time, in this spirit, we summarized and promoted the experience of high-yield harvests of various crops and various types of regions. Later, with the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, many supplements and developments were made to these experiences. Last winter and this spring, we vigorously promoted the experience of deep plowing in Shou Zhang County and the experience of ditch-levee fields and large-area levee fields in Yuncheng County (later, plain reservoirs and river networks were added); in mountainous areas, we promoted the experience of water and soil conservation and soil improvement of the "three-in-one success" of Dashan Commune in Junan County and Xiawei Township in Yishui County; we vigorously promoted the experience of large-area high-yield harvests in Huang County and Ye County, and so on. For important and universally significant experiences, we adopted special measures and methods—some regions summarized these measures and methods as: secretaries start doing it, make a model; air views and debate, come up with a plan; arrange comprehensively, special person in charge; concentrate efforts, complete within a time limit.

In addition to grasping the advanced experiences of our province, we earnestly studied and promoted the experiences of fraternal provinces and regions, and regarded it as a driving force for changing the backward situation. This year, the atmosphere of mutual learning in various places is particularly high, and the forms are diverse. More commonly, the secretary takes the lead and goes out to learn from experience, visiting and studying in advanced units in fraternal provinces and regions, and visiting to ask for advice. From the Provincial Party Committee to the secretaries of the Prefectural, County, and Committee levels, and the heads of various relevant departments, they have respectively visited and studied in fraternal provinces and regions such as Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hebei, and Jiangsu several times. In addition, the heads of the province, prefecture, and county often went to the grassroots level to learn from experience and humbly ask for advice, as an important method to enrich themselves and guide their work. In July of this year, we also concentrated the secretaries of the prefectural and county party committees of the province in Zhengzhou, visited the wheat exhibition held in Henan Province, and debated for three days. Then, we concentrated the members of the Provincial Party Committee and the first secretaries of the prefectural and municipal party committees to visit Shou Zhang and Gaotang in our province. These measures played a great role in solving ideological problems and improving the style of leadership. At the same time, we also hired responsible cadres of advanced units from fraternal provinces and regions to come to our province to "lecture." Some traveled all over the province, introducing their experiences everywhere, and some were invited to help with their work for a long time.

The advanced experiences in various aspects have spread widely throughout the province, breaking the limitations of small circles, opening up people's minds, establishing living models for backward areas, forcing backward areas to find out the reasons for backwardness, redouble their efforts, and catch up quickly. Grasping the advanced and promoting the backward is the main aspect of leadership.

At the same time, we also grasped the backward with the other hand, specifically helping some backward areas to check the reasons for backwardness, seriously study and solve problems, and make them quickly jump to the upper reaches. In turn, use the living things of the backward turnaround to educate the backward, and oppress the advanced areas to continue to move forward. The effect of doing this is very good. For example, in our province, Heze, Linyi, and Liaocheng and other regions had the lowest output in agricultural production in the past, and they have completely turned over this year. Facts have proven: Extremes meet. In these areas that have been backward in production for a long time, cadres and the masses have held back a lot of energy, and there is a strong desire to turn over. Once the masses are mobilized, they can quickly transform and make them move towards their opposite. Shou Zhang and Fan County in the Yellow River area had a grain yield of only two or three hundred jin per mu last year, and this year corn and millet jumped to an average yield of more than 5,000 jin per mu, far exceeding some old advanced ones. This has created a new situation, and the old advanced has become the new backward. Some of the old advanced people originally thought that the conditions were good and the technology was high, and they were complacent and conservative. They did not understand some of the measures to increase production, and production did not leap forward. Now, the ones with poor conditions have made a model, which shocked them, and the thoughts cannot be ignored. The situation is compelling, and it is impossible not to move forward. Everyone "forced" each other and "promoted" each other. This is the characteristic of the great leap forward in agricultural production this year.

Completely Breaking with Conventions and Implementing the "Constitution" of Agriculture

In terms of agricultural production increase measures, the Party Central Committee pointed out the eight-character "Constitution" of agriculture: water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, protection, tools, and management. This is a complete agricultural cultivation system. Everyone has now clearly recognized this "Constitution." However, how to accurately and effectively grasp it in accordance with the time and local conditions is not a very simple and easy task. In this regard, the struggle between two kinds of thinking and two lines is also quite fierce and sharp. Some people are always accustomed to the old way, some are afraid of difficulties, and some are afraid of making any "rash advance" mistakes, and so on. In short, they are unwilling or dare not seriously engage in it. Over the past year, we have adopted a firm attitude, constantly mobilizing the masses to launch a struggle against the above-mentioned various erroneous thoughts, emphasizing that the key to increasing production must be grasped accurately, grasped fiercely, grasped to death, grasped thoroughly. At the same time, grasp the spirit of "grasping early, grasping the main key, grasping late, grasping the weak links," both starting early, making a good start, and striving for initiative; and not letting go of the last opportunity, resolutely making up for defects, and striving for a complete victory. Among the eight major constitutions, we focused on grasping a "soil" character last winter and this spring, and carried out the "deep" and "shallow" dispute, with the province deep plowing, deep excavation, and improved 50 million mu of soil. During the summer sowing, people emphasized the lack of labor and were unwilling to deep plow. We opposed this view and insisted on deep plowing. At the same time, we concentrated our efforts on grasping a "density" character, specifically summarizing the experience of dense planting and increasing production, and formulating dense planting specifications and operating procedures for various crops. Before sowing, we organized the masses several times to launch airing of views and debates, and launched the "sparse" and "dense" dispute; after sowing, we organized in-depth inspections and carried out replanting. The "density" character was not done well enough in some areas during spring sowing, but it was universally promoted during summer sowing.

In the summer and autumn field management, we focused on grasping the "fertilizer" character, widely organizing a large amount of manure accumulation, fertilizer production, and a blitz of early topdressing, and carried out the "more, less" and "early, late" dispute. As a result, each mu generally reached about 100,000 jin. "Forced" the third-class seedlings to upgrade. After the summer harvest, due to the great leap forward in agricultural production and the simultaneous implementation of various basic constructions, a widespread shortage of labor appeared. According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, we highlighted the "tool" character, and within a month, realized the ball bearing of the main agricultural tools. Immediately afterwards, the realization of vehicleization was realized, and various improved agricultural tools were manufactured and promoted.

In order to grasp fiercely, grasp to death, and grasp to the end, we organized two province-wide Party-wide and people-wide inspections in the spring and summer. At the same time, cadres joined the army (joining the masses' "three-transformation" team), went to the fields (cadres went to the fields, big-character posters of the rectification went to the fields, office work went to the fields, eating and living went to the fields), and resolutely ensured that the key to increasing production was grasped and implemented. From the perspective of the whole province, this year has indeed "changed customs and habits" in several major production increase keys, completely breaking with conventions. It not only guarantees the great leap forward in agricultural production this year, but also creates a good foundation and conditions for a greater leap forward in agricultural production in the future.

These are several main situations that have changed the backward situation in Shandong's agricultural production, and also several main experiences we have had in agricultural production over the past year.

Continue to Remove White Flags and Insert Red Flags, and Strive for a Greater Leap Forward Next Year

However, the great leap forward in agricultural production in our province this year is very uneven. Some have completely turned over, most have basically turned over, but some have not yet turned over. Therefore, the backward situation in Shandong's agricultural production cannot be said to have been completely changed. At the same time, from the great leap forward in agricultural production this year, we have more clearly seen that the potential for increasing agricultural production is endless. The masses said: "How bold people are, how much land can produce," "There is only low-yield thinking, no low-yield land." This is a truth. Therefore, the victory we have already achieved is only a beginning. Greater leap forwards and victories are still ahead, waiting for us to strive for. According to the unprecedented favorable conditions in all aspects, it can be predicted that more brilliant achievements will be made on the agricultural production front next year. However, judging from the situation in Shandong, not everyone has recognized this development situation. Most people have liberated their minds, are full of vigor, and strive to leap forward again and again. But some people have only "half-liberated" their minds, lack courage, and are content to be in the middle; there are also some people who are still full of worries, urging but not advancing, and are willing to fall behind. In addition, there is still a small handful of "stubborn factions" who are still trying to find loopholes in every possible way and are carrying out various obstruction and even sabotage activities. Experience tells us that in order to continue to move forward, we must continue to make persistent efforts to win the victory in the struggle on the ideological front, resolutely rely on the vast number of activists who have liberated their minds; patiently educate and help improve the "half-liberated" people, continue to strictly criticize various right-leaning conservative ideas, make the "skeptics" and "onlookers" turn to the left, and resolutely fight against the "stubborn factions" and "promoters of regression." We must continue to insert red flags and remove white flags, and mobilize the vast number of people to make full preparations spiritually and materially. To unswervingly implement the general line of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

We firmly believe that as long as we can do this seriously, on the basis of the great leap forward in agricultural production this year, we will definitely be able to achieve greater victories next year and create better conditions for building socialism ahead of schedule and gradually transitioning to communism.

    山东农业生产的落后局面是怎样改变的
    中共山东省委书记　谭启龙
    和全国各兄弟省区一样，山东今年农业生产获得了空前未有的大跃进。粮食总产量预计可达八百亿斤左右，比去年翻二点三番；棉花总产量可达一千二百万担，比去年翻两番以上；油料、烤烟、大麻、果品等也都获得空前丰收。这在山东农业生产的历史上是一个惊人的奇迹和伟大的胜利。
    这个胜利，使山东整个农村经济面貌发生了巨大的变化，历年来干部和群众最大的压力——粮食问题，今年基本上解决了。这就使我们在农业生产战线上，开始由被动转向主动。
    这个胜利，打开了人们的眼界，使大家开始比较准确地摸到了农业增产的底，大大解放了思想。什么“山东特殊论”、“人多地少，北方旱田，杂粮低产”的“条件论”、“落后论”、“农业增产有限论”等陈词滥调彻底破产了。它为今后农业生产的更大跃进打下了良好基础。
    这个胜利，对全省人民是个极大的鼓舞。它使社会主义在农村中的阵地更加巩固，更加促进了人们思想觉悟的提高和生产关系的进一步改变，大大增强了干部、群众提前建成社会主义和逐步过渡到共产主义的信心。
    取得这个胜利并不是一帆风顺的，更不是偶然的。
    农业生产的空前大丰收，首先是党中央和毛泽东同志关于建设社会主义总路线在山东的胜利，是山东的党组织坚决贯彻以反对地方主义为中心的整风运动的胜利。
    重新配置革命力量  开展两条道路斗争
    几年来，在山东党内，一直存在着两条道路和两条路线的斗争。在省委本身，地方主义分子和右派分子王卓如（省委常委、副省长）、袁子扬（省委委员、副省长）等结合在一起，他们以地方主义、宗派主义、分散主义为表现形式，实质上是搞资本主义。他们一贯顽强的、系统的反对党中央的正确方针路线，反对省委的统一领导。在农业生产和农村工作上，他们是凶恶的促退派。早在1956年秋季，他们就抓住生产高潮中的某些缺点，打起反“冒进”的旗子，向省委大肆进攻。说省委“想早跑到社会主义”，“犯了大错误”，“非检讨不可”。去年秋季制定农业生产规划时，他们仍然以右倾机会主义的观点，反对省委提出的跃进计划，强调这样那样的困难，引经据典，硬说农业生产每年只能增长百分之几，至多百分之十几，讽刺省委是“异想天开，浑身发烧，糊糊涂涂”。而当他们的右倾观点被初步批判之后，到去年冬季，另一部分人，则又以“左”的面目出现，向省委展开了恶毒的攻击。他们说：1956年秋季以前省委是“左倾冒进”，秋季以后是“右倾机会主义”。他们公开反对毛泽东同志关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，强调阶级斗争与敌我矛盾，否认人民内部矛盾是主要的，甚至狂妄的说：如果毛主席了解下边情况，可能不是“夏季形势”，而是要来个“春季形势”了。他们这些攻击，无论是来自右的方面，或者来自“左”的方面，基本目的都是企图制造混乱，把省委“攻垮”。在党内斗争方面，地方主义、右倾机会主义分子，一直怀疑和反对省委遵照中央指示所进行的肃清向明错误影响的斗争；反对对某些长期隐藏在党内的阶级异己分子和重大反革命嫌疑分子的审查和斗争，甚至公开包庇，说他们是“老干部”，“不会有问题”。在党政关系上，他们强调不要党领导的政权独立，强调和省委划分权限。右派分子王卓如、袁子扬等人更公开以“专家”自居，说省委是外行，不懂财经业务，“不当家不知柴米贵”。他们组织宗派小集团、私立仓库、造两本账，对省委明顶暗抗。总之，事情的发展，越来越突出明显地形成了这样一种情况：就是地方主义、右倾机会主义分子和以王卓如、袁子扬为首的反党右派分子结合在一起，并与省、地、县各级干部中气味投合的人互相呼应，和省委背道而驰。因此党中央和省委的指示在省人委和很多地区不能真正执行。显然，这是造成近年来山东落后局面的根本原因。这个问题不解决，要取得各项工作的大跃进，那只能是梦想。
    基于这种情况，一年多来，我们根据中央指示，始终坚决地贯彻了以整风为统帅，采取“以虚带实”和“就实论虚”的方法，坚决与地方主义、右倾机会主义分子，以及党内外一切右派分子展开了反复的、尖锐的斗争。
    首先在1956年秋季全省第一次党代表大会上，省委即坚持党的原则，与反“冒进”、反省委的妖风进行了斗争。但是由于当时的条件不成熟，省委根据中央指示采取了团结的方针，强调调动一切积极因素为建设社会主义服务，对他们的错误只进行了适当批评。其目的是为了教育他们，等待他们觉悟。可是，他们完全辜负了党对他们的期望，会后不仅不检查自己的错误，反而认为这是省委软弱的表现，因而更加趾高气扬起来，在工作中，以右倾机会主义的观点，到处吹毛求疵，散布消极空气，或明或暗地进行反省委的活动。于是，在去年11月召开的全省社会主义建设农业积极分子大会上，一场激烈的辩论开始了。在会议上，省委摆出了跃进的计划，和以水、肥、土为中心的增产关键，同时提出：“靠天吃饭，还是改造自然？”“是爬行，还是跃进？”“是生产到了顶，还是增产无止境？”“灾荒是阻力，还是动力？”“农业大有前途，还是没有前途？”“是做自然的主人，还是做自然的奴隶？”针对这六大分歧，放了一把火，组织大家展开了大鸣大放大争大辩。这一仗打的很好，许多劳动模范拿出了生动事实，从各方面驳倒和击溃了保守派、促退派，取得了第一个胜利，从而初步掀起了冬季生产高潮。接着不久，在全省四级干部会议上，又通过大鸣大放大辩论、大字报，比较彻底的批判了以李峰（惠民地委第一书记）、曹礼琴（泰安地委代理第一书记）为首的反党错误，并在全省传达贯彻，提高了全党觉悟水平，党内开始团结一致，省委的指示也能初步得到贯彻，党政军民开始拧成了一股绳，冬季生产高潮进一步地深入开展起来。但是，问题并没有彻底解决，地方主义、右倾机会主义分子的头目还在隐蔽着。因此，总的来说，山东的被动局面仍没有根本改变。今年春季，经过几次传达贯彻党中央和毛主席关于整风运动的指示，特别是在党的八大二次会议以后，大家的眼睛更加明亮了。在全党觉悟进一步提高的基础上，从省委书记处开始，到省级各个部门，地、县、乡、社各级组织，普遍深入地开展了整风补课运动。在运动中，一方面通过一定会议，大家摆事实讲道理，分析批判，上下互相结合，“以虚带实”；另一方面，通过实际生产行动、现场会议、参观评比等等，“就实论虚”，有计划地分别将省、地、县、乡、社的主要干部，集中到工作先进地区（如黄县、寿张），活人面对活事，摆出鲜明的对立面，两种事迹，两种思想，两种人物，展开大鸣大放大辩论、大字报，大家总结经验，检查落后原因。这样“虚实并举”，有力推动了整风运动的深入发展，取得了很大的胜利。在这一场激烈的斗争中，集中地揭发批判了山东党内地方主义、资本主义右倾机会主义分子，和以王卓如、袁子扬为首的反党右派分子。各级组织、各个地区，亦发动广大干部和群众从思想上、组织上插红旗、拔白旗，大破大立，在解决思想的基础上各级组织均进行了整顿，很多部门与地区重新配置了革命力量。从省委书记、常委委员，到地、县、乡、社、队干部，共拔掉白旗、灰旗干部近四万人。在菏泽专区搞的比较彻底，在县级干部中，反掉了近20％。同时，各地在运动中，都提拔了大批积极分子到领导岗位上来，大大地增强了党的战斗力。现在看来，这是一场不可避免的斗争，不取得这场斗争的胜利，不重新配置革命力量，要改变落后局面是不可能的。
    整风运动深入开展的结果，使山东整个农村的政治面貌焕然一新。全党真正思想一致了，党中央的方针、路线和省委的指示得到了顺利贯彻，广大干部和群众建设社会主义的积极性真正调动起来了，到处高举红旗，干劲冲天，各项工作开始活跃起来，呈现出大跃进的新形势，从而推动了社会主义建设事业全面飞速发展。
    从今年山东的情况来看，那里整风、反地方主义斗争（实质上是反资本主义）搞得越深越透，那里各项工作就越有生气，生产跃进的幅度就越大。反之，就显得落后。菏泽专区历来是全省产量最低的地方，今年整风搞的早，搞的透，翻身最彻底，粮食产量跃居全省第一。这个事实，大家都非常信服。一年来的事实证明，党中央提出的政治思想是一切工作的统帅和灵魂，“马克思主义能够出粮食”，这是颠扑不破的真理。事实又证明，领导权掌握在什么人手里，这是党的方针路线能否认真贯彻的关键，也是能否充分发挥广大人民群众建设社会主义的积极性、创造性，促使农业生产飞跃前进的关键。这是一年来在农业生产上我们体会最深刻的一点。
    改进领导方法  学习外地经验
    在整风运动和反地方主义斗争的基础上，认真转变领导作风，改进领导方法，“抓住先进，推动落后”，“突破落后，压迫先进”，经常保持谦逊态度，虚心学习外地先进经验。这是我们今年在领导农业生产上体会比较深刻的另一点。
    我省近年来，在农业生产方面是比较被动的，落后于兄弟省区。但是，群众中的创造和先进经验还是不少的。去年秋后，我们研究分析了这种情况，认为只要把先进经验普遍推广到全省，山东的落后面貌就可以大大改变，而做到这一步是完全有条件的。当时，本着这个精神，我们总结和推广了各种作物、各类地区的高额丰产经验。后来，随着农业生产大跃进的形势，对这些经验又做了许多补充和发展。去冬今春，我们在平原地区，大力推广了寿张县深翻地的经验，和郓城县沟洫畦田、大地畦田的经验（后来又加上了平原水库和河网化）；在山区推广了莒南县大山社和沂水县夏蔚乡“三合一成功”的水土保持、改良土壤的经验；大力推广了黄县、掖县大面积高额丰产的经验等等。对于重要而具有普遍意义的经验，我们采取了特别的措施和办法——有的地区，把这些措施和办法归纳起来，叫做：书记动手，做出样子；鸣放辩论，搞出规划；全面安排，专人负责；集中力量，限期完成。
    除了抓住本省先进经验以外，我们认真地学习和推广了兄弟省区的经验，并把它当为改变落后局面的动力。今年各地相互学习的空气特别高，形式多种多样，较普遍的是书记挂帅，四出取经，到各兄弟省区的先进单位，亲自参观、留学，登门求教。从省委开始到地、县、委书记，和各级有关部门的负责人，都分别到河南、湖北、安徽、河北、江苏等兄弟省区进行了数次参观、学习。此外，省、地、县的负责人，还经常分别到基层取经，虚心求教，作为丰富自己、指导工作的一个重要方法。在今年7月间，我们还将全省地、县委书记集中到郑州，参观了河南省举办的小麦展览会，并且辩论了三天。接着又将省委委员和地市委第一书记集中到本省的寿张、高唐参观。这些措施，对于解决思想问题，改进领导作风起了很大作用。同时，我们还聘请了各兄弟省区先进单位的负责干部来我省“讲学”，有的走遍全省，到处介绍经验，有的请进来长期帮助工作。
    各方面的先进经验在全省广泛传播，打破了小圈子的局限，使人们的思想开阔起来，给落后地区树立了活的榜样，迫使落后地区不得不找出落后原因，加倍努力，急起直追。抓住先进，推动落后，这是领导上掌握的主要方面。
    同时，我们另一只手则抓住落后，具体帮助一部分落后地区检查落后原因，认真研究解决问题，使他们迅速跃居上游。反过来，再以落后翻身的活事来教育落后，压迫先进地区继续前进。这样做的效果很好，像我省菏泽、临沂、聊城等地区，过去在农业生产上产量最低，今年都彻底翻了身。事实证明：物极必反。在这些长期生产落后的地区，干部和群众都憋了一股子劲，有一种强烈的翻身要求，群众一旦发动起来，就可以迅速转化，使他们走向自己的反面。沿黄河区的寿张、范县，去年亩产粮食不过二、三百斤，今年玉米、谷子一跃平均亩产五千斤以上，远远地超过了一些老先进。这就造成了一个新形势，老先进变成了新落后。老先进原来有些人自以为条件好，技术高，自满保守，对有些增产措施思想不通，生产跃不上去，现在条件差的做出了榜样，使他们大吃一惊，思想再不能不通了，形势逼人，不前进不行了。大家互相“逼迫”，互相“促进”，这是今年农业生产大跃进的特点。
    彻底打破常规  执行农业“宪法”
    在农业增产措施方面，党中央指出水、肥、土、种、密、害、工、管八条农业“宪法”。这是一个完整的农业耕作体系，这部“宪法”，现在大家已经明确认识到了。但是，如何因时因地制宜，抓的准确有力，并不是十分简单容易的事。在这方面，两种思想、两条路线的斗争也是相当激烈尖锐的。有些人总是习惯于老一套，有的害怕困难，有的害怕犯什么“冒进”错误等等。总之不愿或不敢认真的搞。一年来，我们采取了坚定的态度，不断发动群众与上述各种错误思想展开了斗争，强调对增产关键要抓得准，抓得狠，要抓死，抓到家，一抓到底。同时，掌握“抓早、抓主要关键，抓晚、抓薄弱环节”的精神，既要早下手，开好头，争取主动；又要不放松最后时机，坚决弥补缺陷，力争全胜。在八大宪法当中，我们去冬今春，除了突出地抓了水、肥之外，着重地抓了一个“土”字，开展了“深”“浅”之争，全省深翻、深刨、改良土壤五千万亩。在夏播中人们强调劳力不足，不愿深耕，我们反对了这种观点，坚持了深耕。同时，集中力量抓了一个“密”字，专门总结了密植增产的经验，制定了各种作物的密植规格和操作规程，播种前几次组织群众，展开鸣放辩论，展开“稀”“密”之争；播种之后组织了深入检查，进行补种。“密”字在春播时，一部分地区搞的不够好，但到夏播时，就普遍推行了。
    在夏秋田间管理上，我们大抓了“肥”字，广泛组织大量积肥、造肥和突击及早追肥，开展了“多、少”“早、晚”之争，结果每亩一般达到了十万斤左右。“强迫”三类苗升了级。在夏收以后，由于农业生产大跃进和同时进行各项基本建设，普遍出现了劳力紧张的情况，我们根据党中央指示，又突出地抓了一个“工”字，在一个月的时间内，实现了主要农具的滚珠轴承化。紧接又实现了车子化，并且制造和推广了各种改良农具。
    为了抓狠、抓死、抓到底，我们春夏组织了两次全党全民大检查。同时实行干部入伍（加入群众“三化”队伍），到田（干部到田，整风大字报到田，办公到田，吃住到田），坚决保证把各项增产关键抓起来，贯彻下去。从全省情况来看，今年在几项主要增产关键上，确实“移风易俗”，彻底打破了常规。它不仅保证了今年农业生产的大跃进，而且为今后农业生产更大跃进创造了良好的基础和条件。
    这些是改变山东农业生产落后局面的几个主要情况，也是我们一年多以来在农业生产方面的几点主要体会。
    继续拔白旗插红旗  争取明年更大跃进
    但是，我省今年农业生产的大跃进是很不平衡的。有的彻底翻身了，大部分基本上翻身了，但也有的还没有翻身。因此山东农业生产的落后局面还不能说完全改变。同时，从今年农业生产的大跃进中，使我们更加清楚地看到农业增产的潜力是无穷无尽的。群众说：“人有多大胆，地有多大产”，“只有低产思想，没有低产土地。”这是一条真理。因此我们现在已经取得的胜利，仅仅是一个开端，更大的跃进和胜利还在前面，等待我们努力争取。根据现在各方面空前有利的条件，可以预计：明年在农业生产战线上必将取得更加辉煌灿烂的成就。可是，从山东的情况来看，并不是所有的人都已经认清了这个发展形势。大部分的人思想是解放了，朝气勃勃，力争跃进再跃进。但有一部分人思想仅是“半解放”，勇气不足，甘居中游；也有一种人，仍然满脑子顾虑，促而不进，甘拜下风。此外，还有一小撮“顽固派”，仍在千方百计钻空子，进行各种阻挠甚至破坏活动。经验告诉我们，要继续前进，仍然必须再接再厉，继续取得思想战线上斗争的胜利，要坚决依靠已经解放了思想的广大积极分子；耐心教育和帮助提高“半解放”的人，继续严格批判各种右倾保守思想，使“怀疑派”“观潮派”向左转，坚决与“顽固派”、“促退派”作斗争。要继续插红旗，拔白旗，动员广大人民群众从精神上、物质上做好充分的准备。以坚定不移贯彻执行党中央和毛主席鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。
    我们坚信，只要我们能够这样认真做去，在今年农业生产大跃进的基础上，明年一定能够取得更大的胜利，为提前建成社会主义和逐步过渡到共产主义创造更好的条件。
