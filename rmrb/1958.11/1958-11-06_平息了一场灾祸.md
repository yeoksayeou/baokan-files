    Quelling a Disaster
    Yao Shaoxian
    One spring evening, apprentice Sun Shixian was inspecting the ammonia gas cylinders stored in the refrigeration room of the restaurant's basement when he accidentally broke the glass tube calculator on one of the cylinders. Ammonia gas immediately began to spray out of the glass tube. In an instant, the entire kitchen and restaurant were filled with the gas. The ammonia gas continued to spray out uncontrollably, and everyone present was extremely anxious and helpless.
    At this critical moment, a person rushed in like a gust of wind from outside the restaurant. He had just gotten off work. When everyone looked closely, it turned out to be Soviet expert, Malin Yulianke. He was about to go to the restaurant for dinner and smelled the unpleasant odor from afar. Knowing that it was an ammonia accident, he hurried in. But we didn't have any gas masks, and it was too late to borrow them from other units. In a flash, Malin Yulianke grabbed a rag used for wiping tables, soaked it in water, and, while covering his mouth and nose, ran towards the machine room. By the time we tried to stop him, he had already rushed inside. The narrow passage became more and more filled with dense gas, and advancing further meant risking death. A Chinese comrade following behind Malin Yulianke had to pull him back. After returning, Malin Yulianke asked us if there was a second way to access the machine room. We told him that the only way was to jump from the restaurant window into the basement courtyard, and then climb through the small window of the machine room. Upon hearing this, he immediately jumped into the dark basement courtyard. An electrician quickly followed him, jumping in as well. They approached the small window of the machine room and with a "bang" they opened the window, a wave of thick poisonous gas rushed towards them. After Malin Yulianke and his companion squeezed through the window, they felt their way to the small door of the machine room with their eyes closed. The air here was already very thin, and breathing was extremely difficult. They groped and groped! After about three minutes, they finally found the gate and closed it tightly, thus quelling a disaster that was about to erupt.
    When Malin Yulianke returned to the outside of the restaurant, his face was already pale. His white shirt had almost turned black, and beads of sweat and tears dripped from his face to the ground, soaking his clothes. Before we could even express our concern for him, he asked us, "Are any of the Chinese comrades injured?" When we replied that everyone was fine, a smile appeared on his tear- and sweat-streaked face.

    平息了一场灾祸
    姚绍先
    一个春天的晚上，学徒工孙士先正在餐厅地下室冷冻机房检查贮存阿莫尼亚的气罐，一个不小心，碰坏了气罐上的玻璃管计算器，阿莫尼亚气马上从玻璃管内喷出来。倾刻间，整个厨房和餐厅都充满了这种气体。阿莫尼亚气还在源源不断地喷出来，当时在场的人都焦急万分，束手无策。
    正在这紧急关头，一个人像阵风似地从餐厅外跑来了。他是刚刚下班。大家定睛一看，原来是苏联专家马林优连科。他正准备到餐厅来吃饭，远远地闻到了这股难闻味道，知道是阿莫尼亚出了事故，就赶忙跑了进来。可是我们又没有防毒面具，到其它单位去借吧，已经来不及了。说时迟，那时快，马林优连科顺手抓起了擦桌子的抹布，用水浸湿，一边堵自己的嘴和鼻子，一边往机器房跑去。等我们去阻挡他的时候，他已经冲进去了。一条狭窄的小道路，愈往里进，毒气愈浓，如果再往前走，就有死亡的危险。跟在马林优连科后面的一个中国同志，不得不把他拉回来。回来后，马林优连科又向我们打听是否有第二条路可通机器房，我们告诉他只有从餐厅的窗子跳到地下室的围墙内，然后再从机器房的小窗子爬进去。他听了立即就跳到漆黑的地下室围墙内。有一个电工，也连忙跟在他的后面跳了进去。他们走近机器房的小窗户，“砰”的一声把窗子打开，一股浓厚的毒气迎面涌了过来。马林优连科他们二人，从窗子里钻进去后，合着眼摸到机器房的小门旁。这里的空气已很稀薄，呼吸非常困难。摸呀，摸呀！约摸有三分钟的时间，总算找到了闸门，把它紧紧地关上后，一场即将爆发的灾祸才平息下来。
    马林优连科回到餐厅外面来时，脸色已经苍白了，他身上的白衬衣几乎变成了黑衬衣，汗珠和眼泪从脸上掉到地下，也浸透了他的衣服。我们还没来得及慰问他，他倒先问我们：“中国同志受伤了没有？”当我们回答他一切都好时，在他泪汗交加的脸上露出了笑容。
