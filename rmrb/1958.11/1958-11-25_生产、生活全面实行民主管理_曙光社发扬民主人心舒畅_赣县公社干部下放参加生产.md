    Comprehensive Implementation of Democratic Management in Production and Life
    Dawn Commune Promotes Democracy and People Feel Happy; Ganxian Commune Cadres Go Down to Participate in Production
    (Our Newspaper) Taiyuan Dispatch – The Dawn People's Commune in the suburbs of Yuci City, Shanxi Province, has fully promoted democracy within the commune, continuously improved and established management systems, and has established a set of commune democratic management systems suitable for the current situation. Now, this commune is still studying and improving on the original basis in order to further realize the democratization of comprehensive management of production, life and work.
    In the past, although the Dawn Commune had some democratic management systems, many of them were merely formalities, either because the system itself was incomplete or because other conditions were not well coordinated. This year, the all-people rectification and the Great Leap Forward movement, especially the implementation of militarization of labor organization, combatization of action, and collectivization of life, have created favorable conditions for carrying out more extensive socialist democracy. These conditions are: after leading cadres went out of the office and lived, ate, and labored with the commune members, the connection between cadres and the masses was strengthened; the commune frequently used the methods of big contending, big blooming, big character posters, and big debates to carry out criticism and self-criticism; at the same time, after rectification, the political consciousness and enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members for running the commune was raised, they demanded to participate in management, and the collective way of life provided guarantee conditions for commune members to participate in management and exercise democratic rights. Based on the above situation, the Dawn Commune boldly improved and improved the democratic management system in accordance with the principle of democratic commune management.
    In terms of production management, through the contact between cadres and commune members and the opportunity of eating together, work opinions are widely exchanged, criticisms and suggestions from the masses are listened to, and feasible suggestions are implemented after being approved by the commune member representative assembly or the management committee. Some units have even established democratic review meetings, where cadres and commune members check the work of the day together at dinner every night and arrange activities for the next day. Some units use field on-the-spot meetings, mobile big-character posters, etc., to ensure that commune members can fully express their opinions. In addition to daily production management, the Dawn Commune especially emphasizes democratic management in the militarized labor organization. Arranging tasks, organizing competitions, and transferring positions must be discussed by cadres and deliberated by commune members beforehand. If major problems are found in production, organize contention and debate, and mobilize commune members to write big-character posters to solve them. In the army of land reclamation, many commune and team cadres also learn from the tradition of unity between officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, doing work first and eating later, inspecting the commune members' dormitories every night, covering the commune members with quilts, and often having individual heart-to-heart talks with the commune members. If commune members have any problems, they are happy to talk to the cadres. In this way, everyone in the company feels happy. With the realization of the collectivization of life, the Dawn Commune is also gradually improving the democratic management system in life. Now, every canteen in the commune has achieved economic openness, democratically formulated menus, and organized a food management committee with the participation of commune member representatives.
    In the process of strengthening democratic management, the Dawn Commune once carried out a resolute struggle against certain simplistic styles of work, as well as the tendency to only emphasize centralization and ignore democracy, and only emphasize discipline and ignore the opinions of commune members. They adopted a method combining positive reasoning and organizing debates, and constantly conducted ideological education for cadres, continuously improving their level of understanding and improving their leadership style, so that the democratic management system could be implemented smoothly.

    (Our Newspaper) Nanchang Dispatch – Ganxian County, Jiangxi Province, while implementing the "Three-izations," further implements the principle of democratic commune management and mobilizes the masses to participate in production management. So that the commune has both democracy and discipline, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses for production and commune management, and close the relationship between cadres and the masses.
    Ganxian County realized communization in September. The seventeen people's communes in the county implemented the militarization of organization, combatization of action, and collectivization of life. Commune members strengthened their organization and discipline, and production efficiency was greatly improved. However, in view of the recent large number of production tasks and tight schedules, one movement followed another, and the commune was established not long ago, a new set of democratic management experience and methods were still needed in order to further give play to the enthusiasm of commune members. Therefore, at the meeting of the party committee secretaries of the communes, after discussion, specific measures to further improve democratic management were proposed. In terms of cadres, first of all, the production team leaders and party branch secretaries and above of each commune were sent down to the production team to be commune members on a rotational basis. In addition to participating in production and assisting the production team in doing a good job in leading production, they often learned about the opinions and requirements of commune members on the commune, and reported problems to the leadership in a timely manner for research and treatment. Second, the method of big contending, big blooming, and big-character posters was used to solicit opinions in production movements. Third, cadres regularly make work reports to commune members, and commune members check the work style of cadres. On the part of the masses, first, commune members are enabled to participate in all management of the commune. Major matters such as the commune's production plan, financial budget and final accounts, distribution, and labor organization are all submitted to the masses for discussion, and the commune member representative assembly makes decisions based on the opinions of the masses. And regularly publish financial accounts for the masses to review. Second, carry out regular mass self-education, commend socialist activists, and establish the idea of ​​everyone loving the commune.
    Now, after implementing the new approach, the cadres' work style has undergone tremendous changes. The first batch of cadres sent down to the production team to be commune members in various communes learned that the masses currently have three requirements for the commune in labor and production: First, run the public canteens well; second, run nurseries, kindergartens, and homes of happiness well; third, have pocket money. The leaders of each commune believe that these requirements of the commune members are legitimate, and they have taken measures to strengthen the leadership and management of collective welfare undertakings, and at the same time, rationally arranged labor and formed professional teams to vigorously engage in sideline production, which solved the problem of commune members lacking pocket money. The commune members are very satisfied.
    Because cadres consult with the masses on everything, the enthusiasm of commune members for production and commune management has been fully mobilized. The Hongqi Reservoir project built by the Hongqi Commune this year requires a lot of equipment, but the equipment that the state can supply is very small and cannot meet the needs. After the cadres submitted this issue to the masses for debate, everyone offered ideas and thought of ways. A "three dedications" movement of offering suggestions, materials, and talents was launched on the construction site, and construction site factories were set up in a big way. Within a few days, more than a dozen factories such as cement, explosives, rolling beads, tools, and lime were set up; and a technical innovation movement was launched, realizing the semi-mechanization of construction and transportation of "flying in the air and running underground." High-altitude ropeways were set up in the air, and the ground was fully motorized. The project progress was accelerated, and the project investment was also reduced by one-third compared with the original plan. (Ma Zhongming, Liu Guanghui)

    生产、生活全面实行民主管理
    曙光社发扬民主人心舒畅  赣县公社干部下放参加生产
    本报讯　山西榆次市郊区曙光人民公社，充分发扬社内民主，不断改进和建全管理制度，已经建立一套适合目前形势的公社民主管理制度。现在，这个社仍在原有基础上研究改进，以便进一步实现生产生活和工作全面管理民主化。
    过去，曙光社虽然有一些民主管理制度，但是，或者因为制度本身不完备，或者因为其它条件配合不好，很多流于形式。今年，全民整风和生产大跃进运动，特别是实行劳动组织军事化，行动战斗化和生活集体化，给开展更广泛的社会主义民主创造了有利条件。这些条件是：领导干部走出办公室，和社员同吃同住同劳动以后，干部和群众联系加强；社里经常运用大鸣大放大字报大辩论的方式，开展批评自我批评；同时，广大社员经过整风后政治觉悟和办社积极性提高，要求参加管理，而集体生活方式，又为社员参加管理，行使民主权利提供保证条件。基于上述情况，曙光社按着民主办社方针，大胆改进和健全民主管理制度。
    在生产管理方面，通过干部与社员的接触和集体吃饭的机会，广泛交换工作意见，听取群众批评建议，切实可行的建议，经过社员代表大会或管理委员会批准执行。有些单位更建立民主评论会，每天晚饭时，干部和社员一起检查当天的工作，安排明天的活动。有些单位运用田间现场会，流动大字报等，保证社员能充分发表意见。除日常生产管理外，曙光社在军事化劳动组织中特别强调民主管理。安排任务，组织竞赛和转移阵地，事前都要经过干部讨论、社员酝酿。生产中发现较大的问题，组织鸣放辩论，发动社员写大字报解决。翻地大军、许多社队干部还学习解放军官兵一体的传统，做活在前，吃饭在后，每夜巡视社员宿舍，给社员盖被子，还经常和社员个别谈心，社员有什么问题，都乐于找干部谈。这样全连人人心情舒畅。随着生活集体化的实现，曙光社还逐步健全生活方面的民主管理制度。现在，全社每一处食堂都已作到经济公开，民主制订饭单，组织了有社员代表参加的伙食管理委员会。
    曙光社在加强民主管理过程中，曾经和某些简单化作风，以及只强调集中，忽视民主，只强调纪律，忽视社员意见的种种偏向，进行了坚决斗争，采取正面讲道理和组织辩论相结合的方法，经常对干部进行思想教育，不断提高他们的认识水平，改善领导作风，使民主管理制度顺利实施。

    本报讯　江西省赣县各人民公社在实行“三化”的同时，进一步贯彻民主办社的方针，发动群众参加生产管理。使公社既有民主又有纪律，充分发挥了群众生产办社的积极性，密切了干群关系。
    赣县9月份实现了公社化，全县十七个人民公社实行了组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化，社员们加强了组织性和纪律性，生产效率大大提高。但是，县委鉴于最近生产任务多、时间紧，一个运动紧接一个运动，同时公社成立不久，还需要建立一套新的民主管理的经验和办法，以便进一步发挥社员的积极性。因此，在各公社党委书记会议上，经过讨论，提出了进一步搞好民主管理的具体措施。在干部方面，首先，将各公社的生产大队长和党支部书记以上干部，轮流下放到生产组当社员，除参加生产和协助生产小组搞好领导生产的工作外，经常了解社员对公社的意见和要求，发现问题，及时向领导汇报，研究处理。第二，在生产运动中运用大鸣大放大字报的办法，征求意见。第三，干部定期向社员做工作报告，由社员检查干部的工作作风。在群众方面，第一，使社员人人参加公社的一切管理。公社的生产计划、财政预决算、分配和劳动组织等重大事项都交群众讨论，由社员代表大会根据群众意见做出决定。并定期公布财务账目，由群众审查。第二，开展经常性的群众自我教育，评比社会主义积极分子，树立人人爱社的思想。
    现在，执行新的做法以后，干部工作作风有了巨大的转变。各公社首批下放到生产组当社员的干部，在同社员一起劳动和生产中，了解到当前群众对公社有三个要求：一是办好公共食堂；二是办好托儿所、幼儿园和幸福院；三是有零花钱。各公社领导认为社员这些要求是正当的，即采取措施加强了对集体福利事业的领导和管理，同时合理安排了劳力，组成专业队大搞副业生产，解决了社员缺零花钱的问题。社员们非常满意。
    由于干部事事同群众商量，社员的生产和办社积极性已充分调动起来。红旗公社的今年兴修的红旗水库工程，需要的器材多，但是国家能供应的器材很少，不能满足需要。干部把这个问题提交群众辩论后，人人出主意，个个想办法，在工地上掀起了一个献计策、献材料、献人才的“三献”运动，大办工地工厂，几天内便办起了水泥、炸药、滚珠、工具、石灰等十多个工厂；并开展了技术革新运动，实现了“空中飞、地下跑”的施工、运输半机械化，空中架起了高空索道，地面全部车子化。工程进度加快，工程投资也比原计划减少了三分之一。　（马钟明、刘光辉）
