    Coal Miners are Heroic and Spirited, Leaving Britain Behind and Running Fast; Coal Production Leap Forward Plan Completed Ahead of Schedule

    Xinhua News Agency, 7th – The leap forward plan for coal production in our country this year has been completed ahead of schedule. According to statistics from the Ministry of Coal Industry, from January to October, the national production of raw coal has reached more than 222.1 million tons, exceeding the leap forward plan of 210 million tons set in August this year based on the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, an increase of 90 million tons compared with the total coal output last year.

    The early completion of the national coal production leap forward plan this year once again proves the correctness of the policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to take steel as the key link and run industry by the whole people. In April this year, when the coal industry system criticized conservative thinking and proposed a plan to complete 180 million tons of coal output this year, some people doubted whether it could be completed. However, when a mass movement of running industry by the whole people with steel as the key link was launched nationwide, a greater leap forward situation immediately appeared in coal production. The output in September increased by more than 40% compared with August. In October, which was called the key month for steel, 77 counties across the country released more than 90 high-yield satellites with a daily output of more than 10,000 tons of coal. Among them, Liucheng and Xincheng in Guangxi, Yuxian, Linru, Jiyuan, Shaanxian, Dengfeng, Xin'an, Bo'ai in Henan, and Hongzhao in Shanxi, ten counties, had a daily output of more than 1 million tons. Therefore, the national coal production also reached a new peak. The total monthly coal output was more than 70 million tons, which is equal to half of the total output in the first 9 months.

    Conscientiously implementing the policy of small-scale indigenous groups is an important factor in this year's bumper harvest of coal. This is a real way to mobilize the masses to participate in the industrial front. Up to now, more than 20 million people across the country have gone to the mountains to mine coal and coke under the personal leadership of party secretaries at all levels. Carrying hoes and pots, they have excavated more than 100,000 small coal kilns in the mountains, and also created many advanced coal mining experiences. Some opened rows of small cluster wells at the coal seam outcrops, and some removed the entire mountain top and used large explosions to loosen the hard coal seams. Therefore, two months ago, the average daily output of small mines across the country was only 180,000 tons, but in October it has increased sharply to more than 1.6 million tons. In particular, the nine provinces and regions of Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, which were originally short of coal, have all increased their monthly coal output to more than 1 million tons after mobilizing the masses to run small coal kilns. The output in October alone was more than the total output in the first nine months. The specific experiments of these provinces in running small coal kilns are: "Soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals, using decentralized small coal kilns against decentralized small iron factories." Therefore, it not only meets the needs of steel production, but also greatly shortens the distance of coal transportation.

    Since the beginning of this year, the national state-owned coal mines have also been advancing under the high banner of high yield. The average daily output of state-owned coal mines in October has reached 600,000 tons, an increase of 97% compared with January, which is more than twice that of the same period last year. Many mines have doubled their production capacity due to the widespread development of technological innovation and high-yield month campaigns, and have tried every means to overcome difficulties such as insufficient power, equipment, and labor. The output of coal mines in Fuxin, Zaozhuang, Hegang, Shuangya, Jiaozuo, Yiluo, Fengfeng, and Zibo in October has increased by one to three times compared with January.

### 煤矿工人气概豪　抛下英国快步跑  煤炭生产跃进计划提前完成

    煤矿工人气概豪　抛下英国快步跑
    煤炭生产跃进计划提前完成
    新华社7日讯　今年我国煤炭生产的跃进计划已经提前完成。据煤炭工业部统计，从1月到10月，全国生产的原煤已达二亿二千一百多万吨，超过了今年8月根据中共中央政治局扩大会议精神制定的二亿一千万吨的跃进计划，比去年全年的煤产量还增加了九千万吨。
    今年全国煤炭生产跃进计划的提前完成，再一次证明了中共中央提出的以钢为纲的全民办工业方针的正确性。今年4月，当煤炭工业系统批判保守思想，提出今年要完成一亿八千万吨煤炭产量的计划时，还有人怀疑过能否完成，可是当全国开展了以钢为纲全民办工业的群众运动，煤炭生产也立刻出现了更大的跃进局面。9月份的产量就比8月份增长了40％以上。在被称为钢铁关键月的10月份，全国有七十七个县放出了九十多次日产煤万吨以上的高产卫星，其中广西的柳城、忻城，河南的禹县、临汝、济源、陕县、登封、新安、博爱和山西的洪赵十个县日产曾达一百万吨以上。因而使全国煤炭生产也达到了新高峰。全月产煤七千多万吨，等于前9个月总产量的一半。
    认真地贯彻执行小土群的方针，是今年煤炭大丰收的重要因素。这是一个真正能够动员群众参加工业战线的办法。到目前为止，全国已有二千多万人在各级党委书记亲自带领下上山挖煤炼焦。他们背着镢头、带着锅灶，在丛山峻岭中开挖了十多万个小煤窑，同时还创造了许多先进的采煤经验。有的在煤层露头处开了一排排小群井，有的把整个山头都掀掉，用大爆破的办法把坚硬煤层松动了下来。因此，在二个月前，全国小矿的平均日产量只有十八万吨，而10月却已剧增到一百六十多万吨。特别是原来缺煤的甘肃、陕西、河南、湖北、湖南、广西、四川、贵州、云南九个省区，在发动群众大办小煤窑后，月产煤炭都已上升到一百万吨以上，10月一个月的产量，就比前九个月总产量还多。这些省办小煤窑的具体试验是：“兵对兵、将对将、用分散的小煤窑对分散的小铁厂”。因此不但满足了钢铁生产的需要，还大大缩短了煤炭运输的距离。
    全国国营煤矿，今年以来也一直高举着高产红旗前进。10月份国营煤矿的平均日产量已达六十万吨，比1月份上升了97％，等于去年同期的二倍多。许多矿井由于普遍开展了技术革新和高产月运动，千方百计地克服了电力、设备和劳动力不足等困难，生产能力成倍地增长。阜新、枣庄、鹤岗、双鸭、焦作、宜洛、峰峰、淄博等煤矿，10月份产量都比1月份提高了一倍到三倍。
