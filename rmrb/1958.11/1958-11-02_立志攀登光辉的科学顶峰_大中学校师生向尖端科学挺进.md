Xinhua News Agency Report:

    At the "Exhibition of Combining Education with Productive Labor," which opened today, it can be seen that since implementing the Party's education policy, teachers and students in universities and some middle schools across the country are marching towards cutting-edge science with the force of a galloping army, and have already achieved fruitful results.

    The peaceful use of atomic energy is of great significance to the national economy. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of teachers and students have broken superstitions, overcome the difficulties of poor manpower and material conditions, brought into play the spirit of hard work and courageous endeavor, and bravely climbed the peaks of atomic energy science. Accelerators, which are necessary for atomic energy scientific research, have been designed and installed in the past two or three months by Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Nankai University, Tianjin University and other schools, with the support and assistance of Soviet experts and related units. In the process of implementing the combination of education and productive labor, many universities and middle schools have also successfully trial-produced various raw materials for the atomic energy industry, such as uranium, thorium, cadmium, graphite, etc. Monazite is an abundant mineral resource in our country. Teachers and students of Nankai University, Nanjing University and other schools have completed the research on the comprehensive utilization of monazite, and some have extracted uranium, thorium, radium and more than forty kinds of rare earth element compounds. With the help of relevant units, teachers and students of the Engineering Physics Department of Tsinghua University designed and built a "Native Uranium Plant," characterized by low investment, fast construction, and easy promotion throughout the country. Atomic reactors are another important equipment for studying atomic energy science. Teachers and students of the Physics Department of Nankai University designed and installed the "Nankai No. 1" atomic reactor; teachers and students of the Engineering Physics Department of Tsinghua University completed the design of an atomic reactor and made a construction model.

    Computational technology is an important cutting-edge field in modern science. Electronic computers can replace manpower for a large number of heavy calculations and can also be used for automatic control of various machines. According to incomplete statistics, in the past two or three months, schools have produced more than three electronic digital computers, more than forty electronic analog computers, and nearly ten other computing devices. Teachers and students of Northeast Institute of Technology designed and installed a "General-Purpose Fast Digital Electronic Computer." After teachers and students of Peking University established a computer factory, they designed and installed an improved "Peking University No. 1" machine. Teachers and students of Harbin Institute of Technology have produced a "Special-Purpose Digital Electronic Computer" that can speak and play chess. Teachers and students of the Beijing Russian Language Institute, in coordination with the plan of the Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences, have preliminarily compiled a Russian-Chinese automated translation dictionary for mechanical majors.

    Universities and many middle school teachers and students are conducting even more extensive research in another important area of cutting-edge science - semiconductors and radio electronics. Teachers and students have researched and produced many semiconductor materials, semiconductor devices, and communication equipment, including "Pulse Phase Modulation Microwave Multiplex Communication" including transmitters and receivers, and facsimile telegraphs. In terms of electronic instruments, there are waveform analyzers, microwave power meters, decimeter wave oscillators, advanced pulse oscilloscopes, three-way electronic switches, etc., more than ten kinds. These achievements have declared the complete bankruptcy of those doubters who believed in foreign countries and thought that we could not produce precision instruments.

    立志攀登光辉的科学顶峰
    大中学校师生向尖端科学挺进
    据新华社讯　在今天开幕的“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”上可以看到，各地高等学校和部分中等学校师生贯彻党的教育方针以来，正以万马奔腾之势向尖端科学进军，并且已经取得了丰硕的成果。
    原子能的和平利用对国民经济有重大意义。广大师生在党的领导下破除迷信，克服人力、物力条件较差的困难，发挥实干苦干精神，英勇地向原子能科学的高峰攀登。进行原子能科学研究必需的加速器，近二、三个月来，北京大学、清华大学、北京师范大学、南开大学、天津大学等校，在苏联专家和有关单位的支持和帮助下，先后设计安装成了十多架。许多高等学校和中等学校在贯彻教育与生产劳动结合的过程中，还试制成功了原子能工业的各种原料，如铀、钍、镉、石墨等。独居石是我国丰富的矿藏，南开大学、南京大学等校师生完成了独居石综合利用的研究，有的已经提取出铀、钍、镭和四十多种希土元素化合物。清华大学工程物理系师生在有关单位帮助下设计建成了一座“土铀厂”，特点是投资少、建厂快，便于在各地推广。原子反应堆是研究原子能科学的另一重要设备，南开大学物理系师生设计和安装成了“南开一号”原子反应堆；清华大学工程物理等系师生完成了一座原子反应堆的设计并作出了施工模型。
    计算技术是现代科学中一个重要的尖端领域。电子计算机可以代替人力进行大量繁重的计算，也可用于自动控制各种机器。据不完全统计，近二、三月来，各学校已制成三台以上电子数字计算机，四十多台电子模拟计算机，近十台其他计算装置。东北工学院师生设计安装成了一台“通用快速数字电子计算机”。北京大学师生大办计算机工厂以后，设计安装成了“北大一号”改进机。哈尔滨工业大学师生制成的一台会说话、下棋的“专用数字电子计算机”。北京俄语学院师生配合科学院语言研究所的计划初步编成了机械专业俄汉自动化翻译词典。
    各高等学校和不少中等学校师生在尖端科学的另一个重要领域——半导体及无线电电子学方面的研究更为广泛。师生们已经研究、制成了许多半导体材料、半导体器件、通讯设备，其中有包括发射机和接收机的“脉冲调相微波多路通讯”，传真电报机等。在电子仪器方面，有波形分析仪、微波功率计、分米波振荡器，高级脉冲示波器、三路电子开关等等十多种。这些成果，使那些迷信外国，认为我们不能生产精密仪表的怀疑派宣告彻底破产。
