A Shining Banner of Battle
Li Danian

I.

At 10:31 AM on August 14th, a fierce aerial battle was taking place over Pingtan Island in Fujian Province. In the sunlight, the dogfighting squadrons, shimmering silver, thundered with cannon fire. The soldiers and civilians on Pingtan Island watched as one after another, the gray-black American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes were hit by our aircraft, caught fire, and plunged into the sea. They couldn't help but burst into enthusiastic cheers for our sky eagles.

The situation in the air was as follows: In the early morning, Chiang Kai-shek's air force dispatched its so-called "ace" "Sky Tiger" squadron – the Fifth Air Wing – in more than a dozen waves to invade the high altitude airspace outside the Min River estuary. At 10:20 AM, eight American-made F-86 jet fighters, under the cover of another four F-86 aircraft, invaded the airspace over mainland Pingtan from the northeast. Our squadron met them head-on. The distance between the two sides rapidly closed. The enemy's nerves were extraordinarily fragile, and they were scattered at the first encounter. Zhao Junshan, our squadron leader, immediately seized the opportunity, turning his formation to the right and "biting" onto the enemy. Just as they were turning, another batch of enemy planes emerged from international waters, targeting our squadron. Zhou Chunfu, our No. 4 aircraft flying at the rear for cover, saw it clearly. Under normal circumstances, after reminding the squadron leader to pull up and disengage from the enemy, he could make appropriate maneuvers to shake off the enemy's attack. However, the enemy aircraft had already "bitten" onto the tail of our aircraft. More importantly, our aircraft's speed had decreased during the turn, making it difficult to shake off the enemy immediately. If he didn't counterattack immediately, the entire squadron would be subjected to enemy fire. In this extremely urgent situation, Zhou Chunfu's impassioned cry was heard over the radio: "I'll intercept them!"

"I'll intercept them!" These simple six words were filled with heroic and bold spirit! Filled with such noble and rich selfless communist sentiment! He declared to his comrades: In this situation where they were suddenly being "bitten" on the tail by enemy aircraft and difficult to shake off, he would rush into the enemy ranks, intercept them, and shoot them down! He declared to his comrades: Attack the enemy with peace of mind. For your safety, for the overall situation, for the motherland, I will be one against a hundred, invincible!

Zhou Chunfu bravely met the eight enemy aircraft that were rushing from the front and from high altitude...

All of this was clearly visible to the soldiers and civilians on Pingtan Island: Our four silver-white war eagles were turning and chasing four gray-black enemy aircraft, with another four enemy aircraft closely following behind. Just as people were worrying about our aircraft, the last of our aircraft suddenly turned its nose towards the enemy aircraft. With a flash of fire, an enemy aircraft was immediately hit, caught fire, and fell downwards. At this time, the other four enemy aircraft coming down from high altitude sprayed fierce cannon fire at our No. 4 aircraft. Our No. 4 aircraft suddenly reduced its speed, putting the enemy aircraft in front of its guns. Then, cannon fire erupted, and one enemy aircraft was blown up and crashed, and another was hit, spewing thick smoke, and fled in panic. The remaining enemy aircraft immediately scattered and fled. The two enemy aircraft shot down by our comrade Zhou Chunfu fell into the sea southeast and northeast of Pingtan Island, respectively.

However, while our No. 4 aircraft, comrade Zhou Chunfu, shot down two enemy aircraft and damaged one, he also heroically sacrificed himself.

Just a few weeks before participating in the battle, Comrade Zhou Chunfu was still on vacation in his hometown of Changli County, Hebei Province. He heard that the situation on the front line was tense and rushed back to his unit to participate in the war ahead of schedule. After returning home, he encountered continuous rain in the eastern Hebei plain, and he fought the floods with his fellow villagers. Zhou Guiming, a member of the township party committee, repeatedly snatched his shovel and asked him to go back and rest. He said, "I am a soldier of the Party. Wherever the Party and the people need me, I will fight there." He pointed to the green crops and said, "I have never seen such good crops since I was a child. In order to protect the harvest and protect the Great Leap Forward, I must contribute all my strength."

With soaring enthusiasm, he fought the floods with his fellow villagers, working tirelessly for three days and three nights. Due to overwork, he fell ill, but he still insisted on working on the dam. When township cadres ordered him to go back and rest, he still excitedly said, "A soldier doesn't leave the front line when wounded. What does a little fever matter!" It was at this time that he saw news in the newspaper about the United States engaging in military provocations in the Taiwan Strait. The attention of this jet pilot from a peasant background quickly shifted from crops and dams to the front line. He said to the old doctor in the village, "Uncle Liu, any medicine will do. Please find a way to reduce my fever no matter what, I am anxious to return to my unit."

III.

On August 13th, Zhou Chunfu and his comrades completed their first aerial alert mission. As soon as he landed at the airport, he climbed out of the cockpit and asked his comrade Liu Yongsheng, "You came early, you must have seen Taiwan, right?" Liu Yongsheng said, "I can see it every time I fly." Zhou Chunfu said regretfully, "In the air, I could see Kinmen and Matsu clearly... they are so close to the mainland, but the eastern clouds were too thick, and I didn't see Taiwan. Next time I fly, I will definitely take a good look."

On August 14th, before taking off that day, he and flight leader Liu Yongsheng took advantage of the short time waiting to take off to express their feelings to each other. Liu Yongsheng said, "Although we have just been paired up to fly together, I am very happy. I have heard that you were outstanding in aviation school. We must cooperate well in the future." Zhou Chunfu said happily: "Please rest assured! No matter who I am a wingman for, I will fully take care of the whole, and besides, the people of the motherland have high expectations for us. You can rest assured and fiercely strike the enemy! I've got your back.”

Zhou Chunfu fulfilled his oath with his heroic actions. After the battle, squadron leader Liu Yongsheng said with deep gratitude and respect: "At that time, the squadron was fighting the enemy, the formations were flipping, and the situation was changing rapidly. Comrade Zhou Chunfu not only promptly judged the enemy situation, played a role in directing us to successfully strike the enemy, but also selflessly protected the safety of the squadron and set a shining example for us." When the air force leaders heard the news of this great warrior's heroic sacrifice, they said with great emotion: "Zhou Chunfu is a hero with a communist style. With the heroic spirit of Huang Jiguang, who sacrificed himself to save others and who was invincible, he has added great honor to our People's Air Force."

    一面光辉的战斗红旗
    李大年
    一
    8月14日上午10时31分，在我福建省平潭岛上空进行着一场激烈的空战。阳光里，翻飞格斗着的机队，银光闪闪，炮声隆隆。平潭岛上的军民们，眼看着一架架灰黑色的美制蒋机被我机打中着火向海面跌落的情景，禁不住向我们的天鹰爆发出热烈的欢呼。
    这时空中的情况是这样的：清晨，蒋介石空军派出了号称“王牌”“天虎”大队——第五航空大队，先后十几批侵入我闽江口外的高空。10点20分，八架美制F—86型喷气战斗机，在另外四架F—86型飞机的掩护下，从东北侵入我平潭大陆上空，我机队对面迎击上去。双方的距离在迅速地缩短着。敌人的神经是异常脆弱的，一照面就被我冲散了，我带队长机赵俊山立即抓住战机，带着他的编队向右拉转回来，“咬”上了敌人。就在这转弯的时候，从公海上又窜来一批敌机，盯上了我们的机队。掩护飞行在最后的我四号机周春富，看得清清楚楚。按通常的情况，他在提醒带队长机拉起脱离敌人后，自己可以做适当的动作，甩开敌人的攻击。但是敌机已经“咬”上了我机的尾部，更重要的是，我机由于在转弯途中，速度减小，难以马上甩开敌人，如不立即反击，全队就要遭到敌人的射击。在这万分紧急的情况下，只听得无线电里传出了周春富激昂的喊声：“我来截住它们！”
    “我来截住它们！”这简单的六个字，充满着多么英雄豪迈的气概！充满着多么高尚、丰富的忘我的共产主义感情！他向战友们宣示：在这突然遭受敌机“咬”尾又难于摆脱的情况下，他要闯入敌群，截住它，打掉它！他向战友们宣示：放心地攻击敌人吧，为了你们的安全，为了整体，为了祖国，我要以一当百，有我无敌！
    周春富对着从正面、高空分别冲来的八架敌机，英勇地迎击上去。……
    这一切情景，在我平潭岛上的军民眼里看得清清楚楚：我四架银白色的战鹰在转弯追击着四架灰黑色的敌机，身后又紧紧跟来了另外四架敌机。人们正在替我机担心的时候，飞行在最后的一架我机，猛然调转机头向敌机冲去，火光闪处，一架敌机登时被打中着火向下跌落。这时，从高空下来的另外四架敌机，又把激烈的炮火，向我四号机身上喷射。只见我四号机猛一收速度，把敌机闪到自己的炮口前面，接着炮火怒发，一架敌机被打得爆炸坠落，一架敌机被打得直冒浓烟，仓皇逃走。剩下的敌机也立即逃散。被我四号机周春富同志打落的两架敌机，分别跌落在平潭岛东南和东北的大海里。
    但是，我四号机周春富同志在击落敌机两架，击伤敌机一架的同时，也壮烈牺牲了。
    二
    参加战斗前的十几天，周春富同志还在他的家乡河北省昌黎县度假期。他是听到前线局势紧张，提前赶回部队参战的。他回家后，正值冀东平原霪雨连绵，他同乡亲们一起同洪水战斗。乡党委委员周贵明，几次夺下他的铁铲要他回去休息，他说：“我是党的战士，党和人民那里需要，我就在那里战斗。”他用手指着绿油油的庄稼说：“这样好的庄稼，我从小就没见过，为了保卫丰收，保卫大跃进，我必须贡献出一切力量。”
    他以冲天的干劲，和乡亲们一起同洪水搏斗，一气干了三日三夜。由于过度疲劳，他生病了，但他仍然坚持在堤坝劳动。当乡干部以命令口气要他回去休息时，他仍然激奋地说：“战士是负伤不下火线的，发点烧算什么！”就在这时，他从报纸上看到了美国在台湾海峡进行军事挑衅的消息。这位农民出身的喷气机驾驶员的注意力，迅速从庄稼和堤坝转移到了前线。他对乡里的老医生说：“刘大爷，吃什么药都行，无论如何请你想办法把我的烧减退下来，我急着要回部队去。”
    三
    8月13日，周春富第一次同战友完成了空中警戒任务，刚刚降落到机场上，他爬出座舱就向他的战友刘永生问道“你来的早，一定看见过台湾了吧”，刘永生说：“每次飞行都能看到”。周春富很遗憾地说：“在空中，金门、马祖，我都看清了，……离大陆那么近，就是东面云雾大，没看见台湾，下次飞行，一定好好看看。”
    8月14日，这天起飞之前，他同长机刘永生，还利用待命升空的短暂时间，互相倾诉了心情，刘永生说：“咱们虽然是刚刚搭配在一起飞，但我很高兴，我听说过，你在航校就是好样的。咱们今后要好好配合。”“周春富高兴地说：请你放心吧！不管给谁当僚机，我都要全力照顾整体，何况祖国人民对我们寄予了很大期望，你尽管放心痛击敌人吧！后面有我。”
    周春富，以自己的英雄行为实现了他的誓言。战斗结束后，带队长机刘永生同志怀着深深的感念和尊敬说：“在当时，机队同敌人格斗，机群翻飞，情况瞬息万变。周春富同志不仅及时判清了敌情，起了指挥我们胜利打击敌人的作用，而且舍身掩护了机队的安全，给我们树立了光辉的榜样。”当空军首长听到这位伟大战士壮烈牺牲的消息时，感慨万分地说：“周春富是一个具有共产主义风格的英雄，他以舍身救人和有我无敌的黄继光式的英雄气概，给我们人民空军增加了莫大的荣誉。”
