The public dining hall is praised by everyone
　　No More Worrying About Wind and Snow

　　One drizzly noon, I arrived at Laoya Chen Village, the location of the Zhengzhou Northern Suburb People's Commune. The commune's Party Secretary led me on a tour of the village's large dining hall. This was a brand-new large brick house, just built, large enough to accommodate more than six hundred people from the entire village at once. The whitewashed walls, bright glass windows, and the brand-new cotton door curtains hanging on the two large doors gave one a feeling of warmth and comfort. The people here told me that the bricks, tiles, and lumber needed to build this dining hall were all provided by the commune members themselves, and the commune spent very little money.

　　It was lunchtime, and all six hundred-plus villagers were comfortably seated around brick and cement tables, happily sharing their lunch. Here, the steamed bun baskets were covered with cotton covers; the earthenware jars for soup were also covered. It is said that they will soon find a way to add fire under the jars to ensure that commune members can eat hot soup and hot meals.

　　The commune's Party Secretary here told me: not long ago, the members here were eating outdoors. People sarcastically called it the "Street Dining Hall." Many commune members privately commented, "North wind blows, snowflakes fly, the public dining hall won't last long!" But since the beginning of the month, when the commune launched a crash campaign to build dining halls, all one hundred and sixty dining halls in the commune were built in three days, and cold-proof equipment such as steamed bun baskets and insulated water tanks were added. More than 50,000 commune members can now comfortably enjoy hot soup, hot dishes, and hot meals in the dining hall. The argument that the public dining hall won't last long and won't survive the winter is no longer heard. (Kan Feng)

    公共食堂人人夸
    再不担心刮风下雪了
    一个雨蒙蒙的中午，我来到郑州北郊人民公社所在地老鸦陈村。公社党委书记带领我参观了这个村里的大餐厅。这是一座刚刚建成的崭新的大瓦房，足够全村六百多人同时进餐。那用石灰粉刷过的墙壁，明亮的玻璃窗，和在两个大门上挂着的崭新的棉门帘，看去就给人一个温暖舒适的感觉。这里的人们告诉我，建造这座餐厅所需的砖瓦、木料等，都是社员自己拿出来的，社内花钱很少。
    这正是吃午饭的时候，全村的六百多人都舒适地围坐在一个个用砖和洋灰砌成的饭桌旁，和乐地共进午餐。在这里，放馒头的馍篓上盖上了棉花盖；盛汤的瓦缸上也都加了盖。据说最近还要设法在缸底下加火，保证社员们都能吃到热汤热饭。
    这里的公社党委书记告诉我：不久以前，这儿的社员都是露天吃饭。人们都讥讽地称呼这是：“顺街大饭厅”。不少社员背地里议论说：“北风吹，雪花飘，公共食堂寿不长！”但自从月初全社展开了突击修建餐厅的运动，全社一百六十个食堂，在三天里便都修建起了餐厅，并且增添馍篓、水暖缸等防寒设备。五万多社员现在都能在餐厅里舒服地享用热汤、热菜和热饭了。那种认为公共食堂寿不长，熬不过冬天的论调，已经再也听不到了。　（阚枫）
