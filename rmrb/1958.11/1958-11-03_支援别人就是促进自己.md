    Supporting Others is Promoting Oneself
    Jia Shuyuan
    There are two kinds of support: one is voluntary support, and the other is passive support. Some people see support as being in opposition to the leap forward of their own unit. They believe that supporting other units will prevent their own unit from making a leap forward, and that their own unit's leap forward will prevent them from supporting other units. In fact, the two are a unity of opposites. Supporting others is actually promoting oneself. Because before the support, your unit's work seemed normal, but supporting other units disrupted the normal state of your unit, making it abnormal. When things are normal, you don't use your brains, and you are in a state of satisfaction; when you support other units and things become abnormal, you are dissatisfied, and you will use your brains and think of ways to change from abnormal to normal. This process itself plays a role in promoting the progress of your unit's work, which is precisely the dialectical relationship of things. It is also the truth that Chairman Mao spoke of: imbalance is absolute, and balance is relative. Contradictions can push things forward, and unity keeps things in a temporarily stable state.
    The communist spirit of large-scale collaboration has already taken shape across the country. In this situation, will you work hard to support others or refuse to do so? The attitude we take is to provide the greatest possible support with a communist style, giving full play to our own potential. Some comrades say: we don't have enough people, yet we still support others. In fact, if you have four people, using one person to support other units and the remaining three people working hard to do the work of the original four people, you are both supporting others and strengthening yourself. Isn't this better for socialist construction?

    支援别人就是促进自己

    支援有两种：一种是自愿的支援，一种是被动的支援。有的把支援与本单位跃进对立起来了。他们认为支援了别的单位自己本单位就不能跃进，自己单位跃进就不能支援别的单位。实际上二者是矛盾的统一。支援了别人，也就是促进了自己。因为在支援以前，你单位的工作好像是正常，支援了别的单位，打破了你单位的正常状态，而不正常了。在正常时你不开动脑筋，你处在满意的状态；支援了别的单位而不正常了，你不满意了，你就会开动脑筋，想办法由不正常变为正常。这个过程本身就是起促进你单位工作前进的作用，这正是事物发展的辩证关系。也就是毛主席所说过的：不平衡是绝对的，平衡是相对的真理。矛盾可以推动事物的前进，统一使事物处在暂时稳定状态。
    共产主义大协作的风气已经在全国形成。在这种形势下，你是努力地支援别人呢还是拒绝呢？我们所采取的态度是以共产主义风格尽最大的努力支援，充分发挥自己的潜力。有的同志说：我们人不够还支援人家。事实上，你们如果有四个人，用一个人去支援其他单位，余下三人努力干原来四个人的活，既支援了别人，也加强了自己，这不是对社会主义建设更好吗？
