What are we doing, exerting ourselves on the agricultural front, striving for excellence? For a bumper harvest. The fruits of a year's hard work, though plentiful, cannot be considered a true harvest if these abundant fruits are left in the fields. We must, by every possible means, completely secure these fruits of the Great Leap Forward. This newspaper published an editorial on October 12 entitled "Bring in All the Fruits of the Harvest." In the past twenty days, many regions across the country have engaged in a tense battle to harvest the ripened crops from the fields, ensuring that every grain returns home.

In many areas, despite the intense situation of simultaneous steelmaking and autumn harvesting and planting, by fully implementing the mass line and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses, they truly achieved both steel production and autumn harvest without neglecting either. The Hongqi People's Commune in Fengcheng County, Jiangxi, set a very good example in this regard. The Hongqi Commune had a total of 24,000 full and semi-able-bodied laborers, of which 11,000 were drawn away to work on steel and water conservancy projects. This year's autumn harvest and planting tasks were larger than last year, requiring a total of more than 240,000 workdays. However, those who remained at home were mostly semi-able-bodied laborers, and calculated in workdays, they could only contribute 120,000 workdays. In this situation, the commune's Party committee fully mobilized the masses to engage in vigorous airing of views, big contending, and big debates, reversing the negative thinking of some who believed that those left at home were a "mess" and "unable to complete the autumn harvest tasks." They effectively mobilized and organized the strength of women, the elderly, and children; extracted more than 800 laborers from public canteens using the method of substituting the weak for the strong; mobilized more than 3,000 residents from towns to help with production; and also mobilized more than 2,000 steelmaking workers near the commune who were transporting charcoal to participate in the autumn harvest during production gaps. In this way, they made every effort to tap potential and finally, while engaging in a tense struggle for steel, victoriously completed the autumn harvest tasks, achieving the first place in the county in terms of both speed and quality of the autumn harvest. The moving example of the Hongqi Commune in Fengcheng County is a very convincing revelation to those who believe that steel and autumn harvest cannot be carried out simultaneously.

Some regions have also adopted the method of following one intense steel battle with an autumn harvest battle, achieving the same effect of not neglecting either steel or autumn harvest. After winning a great victory on the steel battlefield, the Yulin Special Zone in Guangxi transferred most of its labor force to the autumn harvest struggle, except for a portion of the labor force that remained to persist in the steel battle. By October 26, a total of 1.05 million troops had been投入into the autumn harvest battle, and the harvesting speed had increased by three and a half times compared to before October 23. Precisely because a series of effective measures were adopted, the autumn harvest work in these regions truly achieved fast and meticulous harvesting.

In other regions, autumn harvest work is being thoroughly inspected, and when it is found that the harvest is not meticulous enough, the masses are immediately mobilized to organize a "second autumn harvest." Shanxi has mobilized women, the elderly, and children to form a "second autumn harvest" army, and has put forward the slogan "Check every plot, pick up every ear, gather every grain, pick up the mature ears, and grab the immature ones." According to preliminary statistics from Changzhi, Yanbei, Xinzhou, Yuci and other regions, more than 121 million jin of grain have been picked up. The Hongqi and Hongguang People's Communes in Xianyang, Shaanxi, also mobilized the masses to pick up 450,000 jin of grain from the harvested fields.

However, the harvesting work in many regions is unsatisfactory. Tubers and cotton have ripened but have not been harvested in time. Even those that have been harvested are still piled in the fields without being transported back, or the harvesting work is very rough, with a lot of crops scattered in the fields, and no immediate supplementary harvesting has been carried out. In order to secure all the fruits of the harvest, it is currently necessary to speed up the harvest of crops urgently awaiting harvest and to ensure meticulous harvesting and threshing, guaranteeing that not a single grain or piece is lost. At the same time, areas where the harvesting work is rough should also organize forces to conduct a "make-up" harvest to ensure that the abandoned crops are picked up. We must do the autumn harvest work quickly and meticulously to ensure that every grain (including oil crops) is stored in the granary and every boll of cotton is stacked. Only when all the fruits of the harvest are brought back and stored in the warehouses can the autumn harvest work be considered a complete victory.

According to the experience of many regions, to complete the autumn harvest tasks, it is necessary to make a comprehensive arrangement of the labor force according to the current situation of the three autumn harvests and steel production. While consolidating and improving the steel army, a portion of the labor force should be immediately drawn from the steel front and投入into the autumn harvest front, and all the labor force that can be mobilized in rural and urban areas should be mobilized to participate in the autumn harvest. Areas that need autumn harvest "make-up" lessons should immediately organize forces to carry out a second autumn harvest.

Since the autumn harvest, various places have created and invented many advanced harvesting tools that are efficient and easy to manufacture. However, many regions have not done a good job in promoting tools. In order to complete the autumn harvest tasks by surprise, all localities should focus the current tool reform work on the surprise manufacture and promotion of tools for harvesting, digging, transporting, threshing, and slicing tubers. This is a reliable guarantee for accelerating the harvesting work. Sichuan Province has promoted hundreds of thousands of "sweet potato digging plows," which dig sweet potatoes and deep plow at the same time, killing two birds with one stone. The efficiency is three to five times higher than digging sweet potatoes by hand, thus greatly accelerating the progress of digging sweet potatoes. Hebei, Anhui, Jiangsu and other places have created a variety of sweet potato digging machines. Wherever the sweet potato digging machines are actively promoted, the tuber harvest is relatively fast. In addition, various fast rice harvesting tools created in the rice-producing areas of the South have proved to be the most effective rice harvesting tools at present, and must be vigorously promoted in the late rice harvest.

The autumn harvest work includes a series of important links such as harvesting, digging, transportation, threshing, threshing, and storage. Slackening or stagnation in any link will cause irreparable losses. At present, it is particularly noteworthy that in some areas, transportation cannot keep up with the harvest, so that a large number of crops are piled in the fields, and there is a danger of being attacked by rain and snow and ruined by birds and beasts at any time. In some places, the progress of threshing and threshing is also very slow, which can easily cause grain losses. The party and government leading organs in these areas must seize the opportunity to inspect and urge them to connect the various links of the autumn harvest work with each other and move forward step by step until a complete victory is achieved.

### 力争秋收全胜

    力争秋收全胜
    我们在农业战线上鼓足干劲，力争上游为了什么呢？为了大丰收。一年来辛苦的果实，虽然十分丰富，但是如果让这些丰硕的果实留在田里，就不能算真正的丰收。我们必须千方百计地把这些大跃进的果实完全拿到手里。本报在10月12日发表了题为“把丰收的果实全部拿到手”的社论。二十天来，全国很多地区进行了紧张的战斗，把地里已经成熟的作物收割回来，保证了颗粒还家。
    很多地区在炼钢炼铁和秋收秋种同时进行的紧张情况下，由于充分贯彻了群众路线，充分发挥了群众的干劲，真正作到了钢铁和秋收两不误。江西丰城县红旗公社在这方面，树立了很好的榜样。红旗社全劳力和半劳力一共折合二万四千个劳动力，抽走了一万一千个去搞钢铁、修水利。今年秋收秋种任务比去年大，共需二十四万多劳动日，但是留在家里的多是半劳动力，按劳动日计算只能作十二万个劳动日。在这种情况下，公社党委充分发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，扭转了一些人认为家里留下的是“烂摊子”、“完不成秋收任务”的消极思想。他们很好地动员和组织了妇女、老人和儿童的力量；用以弱代强的办法从公共食堂中抽出了八百多个劳动力；动员了市镇三千多居民帮助生产；还发动公社附近运送木炭的二千多个钢铁大军利用生产空隙参加秋收，这样千方百计地挖掘潜力，终于在紧张的为钢铁斗争的同时，胜利地完成了秋收任务，在秋收的速度和质量上都是全县的第一名。丰城县红旗社的动人事例，对那些认为钢铁和秋收不能同时并举的人，就是十分令人信服的启示。
    有一些地区又采取一个紧张的钢铁战役紧接一个秋收战役的办法，也同样收到了钢铁秋收两不误的效果。广西玉林专区在钢铁战场获得大胜以后，除留一部分劳动力坚持钢铁战斗外，把大部分劳动力调到秋收斗争中来。到10月26日止，全区已有一百零五万大军投入秋收战斗，收割速度比23日以前提高了三倍半。正因为采取了一系列的有效办法，这些地区的秋收工作，真正作到了收得快，收得细。
    在另外一些地区，正在进行秋收工作的大检查，发现收得不细，立即动员群众，组织“第二次秋收”。山西就发动妇女、老人和儿童，组成了“第二次秋收”大军，并且提出了“块块查，穗穗拾，粒粒拣，成穗的拣起来，不成穗的抓起来”的口号。据长治、雁北、忻县、榆次等地区初步统计，拣回的粮有一亿二千一百多万斤。陕西咸阳红旗、红光等四个人民公社，也发动群众在收过的地里拣回粮食四十五万斤。
    但是也有不少地区的收获工作是不能令人满意的，薯类和棉花已经成熟，没有及时收获回来，就是已经收获的，也还有些作物堆放在田里没有运回来，或者收获工作做得很粗糙，庄稼抛撒在田间的很多，还没有立即进行补收。为了把丰收的果实全部拿到手，当前必须对于急待收获的农作物加紧收获，并且要做到细收细打，保证不遗失一粒一块。与此同时，收获工作粗糙的地区也应当组织力量进行收获“补课”，保证把遗弃的庄稼拣回来。我们一定要把秋收工作做得又快又细，保证颗颗粮食（包括油料）归仓，朵朵棉花归垛。只有把丰收果实全部收回来归入仓库，秋收工作才算是取得了全胜。
    根据许多地区的经验，要完成秋收任务，需要根据目前三秋工作和钢铁生产的情况，对劳动力进行全面安排，在巩固和提高钢铁大军的条件下，从钢铁战线立即抽调一部分劳动力投入秋收战线，并且把农村和城镇中一切可以动员的劳动力动员起来，参加秋收。需要秋收“补课”的地方应当立即组织力量进行第二次秋收。
    秋收以来，各地创造发明了不少效率高、制造简易的先进收获工具。但是，很多地区推广工具的工作作得不好。为了突击完成秋收任务，各地应当把当前工具改革工作的重点放在突击制造和推广收割、刨挖、运输、脱粒、薯类切片等工具方面。这是加速收获工作的可靠保证。四川省各地推广了几十万部“挖苕（甘薯）犁”，既挖薯，又深耕，一箭双雕，比用人刨薯效率提高了三倍到五倍，因而大大加快了挖薯进度。河北、安徽、江苏等地创制出好多种刨薯机，凡是积极推广刨薯机的地方，薯类收获都比较快。此外，南方水稻产区创造的各种快速割禾器，已经证明是目前最有效的水稻收割工具，在晚稻收割中必须大力推广。 
    秋收工作包括收割、刨挖、运输、打场、脱粒、贮藏等一系列的重要环节，在任何一个环节上松劲、停滞，都会造成不可挽回的损失。目前特别值得注意的是某些地区运输跟不上收割，以致大量庄稼堆放在田野，时刻都有遭受雨雪袭击和鸟兽糟蹋的危险。还有一些地方打场、脱粒工作进展很慢，也容易使粮食遭受损失。这些地区的党政领导机关必须抓紧检查、督促，使秋收工作各个环节互相衔接，步步前进，直到获得全胜。
