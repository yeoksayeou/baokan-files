    Supply System and "From Each According to His Needs"
    Luo Gengmo

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out during his inspection in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng in September: "The implementation of the supply system now is different from the time of the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, it was implemented when materials were scarce. Now it is implemented when materials are gradually becoming abundant, which is very different." Therefore, compared with the supply system during the War of Resistance Against Japan, we can call the supply system now being tried the new supply system. The new and old supply systems have three things in common: (1) Allocating a certain amount of necessities, mainly clothing and food, according to the population; (2) The quantity and quality of the distribution are the same, or there is very little difference; (3) It is different from the socialist principle of distribution according to labor and has a communist spirit of equality. There are also two special reasons for the implementation of the supply system in some counties now (such as Xushui in Hebei, Xiuwu in Henan, etc.): First, the five-in-one commune organization of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers has a tendency to rapidly develop from township and commune to county-level joint communes or one commune per county. County-level state employees and county-level state-owned enterprise employees are also commune members, and their living standards should be consistent with those of the current township and commune members; Second, there are unreasonable elements in the current wage system of state organs. For example, it mainly reflects the principle of distribution according to labor, especially the excessive wage differentials, which create a large gap in living standards between leaders and cadres, and between cadres and the masses, which is not conducive to gradually raising the socialist distribution system to the communist distribution system. Therefore, it is necessary to partially change to the supply system, so that the lives of cadres and peasants are closer.

    The supply system is different from the wage system. The latter is distributed according to the quantity and quality of labor, with more work resulting in more pay and less work resulting in less pay. In the new supply system currently implemented in various communes and some county party and government organs, there are also some differences in the distribution standards, some of which have the nature of payment according to work, such as some leading cadres eating slightly higher middle meals, and general cadres eating slightly lower large meals. But some are not paid according to work, such as the food in the homes of the elderly being slightly higher than that of ordinary commune members, especially most of the standards in the supply system are equal for everyone. The law of development of the current new supply system will be that the more gradually abundant social production becomes, the more gradually the supply system standards will increase, thereby gradually eliminating the differences such as the aforementioned middle and large meals.

    The current new supply system is distributed according to population, and in this respect, it has something in common with the communist distribution according to population and needs. However, we cannot therefore confuse the current new supply system with the communist "from each according to his needs" distribution system. Because although the supply system is distributed according to population, it has fixed quotas, which is not "from each according to his needs". To explain this problem, we should first clarify the three misunderstandings that people often have about the communist "from each according to his needs" distribution system: First, they mistakenly believe that in the future communist society, when "from each according to his needs" is implemented, people can arbitrarily take whatever they need, without being subject to social planning and management. This is not communism but anarchism; Second, they mistakenly believe that the "from each according to his needs" distribution system is implemented all at once on a certain morning after conditions such as extremely high development of productive forces are fully met, rather than being accumulated during the socialist construction period through a gradual process of quantitative change and various local qualitative changes. Therefore, they regard it as a distant matter completely separate from the current socialist construction, which is a metaphysical point of view; Third, they mistakenly believe that after entering communist society, people can infinitely take and enjoy everything they need in life in the same way. This view violates the dialectical law of the development of things, and it regards the production and the consumption or needs subordinate to production in the future communist society as stagnant and unchanging things. In fact, the communist distribution system (from each according to his needs) will be formed and developed in this way: (1) In the socialist stage, with the great development of productive forces, when a certain means of livelihood has reached a sufficient degree of abundance, it can first gradually be supplied according to the principle of "from each according to his needs", changing from low-price supply to free supply, and without quotas, but subject to social planning and management. Therefore, the transformation from socialist "distribution according to labor" to communist "from each according to his needs" is gradually realized. (2) After entering socialist society, although the original means of livelihood have been enriched to the point where "from each according to his needs" can be implemented, the development of production is infinite, which will constantly lead to new consumer needs. People's needs in turn will promote the development of production. For example, if televisions are produced, we want to have televisions; in the future, when the development of scientific production technologies such as rockets enable people to make interstellar travel to the moon and Mars, people will list the requirements for interstellar travel on their life program list. It is not difficult to understand that new products cannot be as abundant as old products all at once at the beginning, and this part of the product cannot be supplied without limits at the beginning, and may even only be enjoyed by social labor models and advanced figures at the beginning. After the new product becomes abundant, it can be opened to society as a new item of "from each according to his needs" like other daily necessities.

    Based on the above, it can be seen that the new supply system currently implemented by the people's communes has something in common with the communist distribution system in terms of distribution according to population and basically everyone being equal, but it is not yet the communist "from each according to his needs" distribution system. Some people believe that the current limited quota of grain, food, or basic livelihood materials supply system implemented by the people's communes is the beginning of the communist "from each according to his needs" system, based on the two reasons that the aforementioned communist "from each according to his needs" is gradually realized, that it can begin to appear in the socialist stage, and that it also has certain limitations in the future communist stage. This is naturally incorrect or inappropriate. Because although the "from each according to his needs" distribution system can start from some individual means of livelihood at a certain stage of development of socialism, the characteristic of "from each according to his needs" is that it is both according to population and unlimited, unlike the supply system implemented by the people's communes, which is according to population but has limited quotas. As for the future communist society implementing "from each according to his needs", there will still be individual new products that need to be supplied with limited quotas temporarily, and their nature and situation cannot be confused with the current fixed quota supply of grain, food, or basic livelihood materials implemented by the people's communes. However, it is also wrong to ignore or deny the communist factors or buds in the supply system. The former view is to beautify the supply system too much and simplify the communist distribution system, which will affect people's continuous struggle to achieve communism. The latter view is that both socialist "distribution according to labor" and communist "from each according to his needs" are superstitious, and they do not see the superiority of the supply system implemented in our country in the past and present, and that the new supply system that has now begun can accelerate the transition to communism.

    供给制与“各取所需”
    骆耕漠
    刘少奇同志9月间在郑州、开封视察工作时，曾指出：“现在实行供给制同抗日战争时候不一样，那时是在物资缺乏的时候实行的，现在是在物资逐渐丰富的时候实行的，有很大不同。”所以，同抗日战争时期的供给制相比，我们可以称现在试行的供给制为新供给制。新老供给制在以下三点上是共同的：（一）按人口分配一定量的必需品，主要是衣、食两项；（二）分配的数量和质量相同，或者只有很小的差别；（三）它不同于社会主义的按劳分配原则，而具有共产主义的平等精神。现在有些县（如河北徐水、河南修武等县）实行供给制，还有以下两个特殊原因：第一，工农商学兵等五位一体的公社组织，有由乡社迅速发展为县联社或一县一社的趋势，县级国家工作人员和县级国营企业人员亦同为公社社员，他们在生活制度上应与现在的乡社社员一致起来；第二，国家机关现行的工资制中有不合理的成分。如主要是体现了按劳分配原则，特别是工资级差过大，形成领导人员和干部、干部和群众之间在生活上的距离大了一些，不利于从社会主义分配制度逐渐提高为共产主义分配制度。因此有局部改行供给制的必要，以便干部与农民的生活比较接近。
    供给制与工资制不同。后者是按劳动的数量和质量分配，多劳动者多得，少劳动者少得。现在各公社和有些县的党政机关所实行的新供给制中，在分配标准上也部分地有某些差别，其中有的并带有按劳计酬的性质，如有些领导干部吃略高的中灶，一般干部吃略低的大灶。但是有的并非按劳计酬，如幸福院的伙食略高于一般社员的伙食，特别是供给制中的大部分标准是人人平等的。现行新供给制的发展规律，将是社会生产越逐渐丰富，供给制标准就越逐渐提高，从而像前述大中灶等差别就会逐渐消灭。
    现行的新供给制是按人口分配的，在这一点上，它与共产主义的按人口和按需要分配有共同之处。但是我们不能因此就将现行的新供给制同共产主义的“各取所需”的分配制度混为一谈。因为供给制虽按人口分配，但有定额限制，这就不是“各取所需”。为了说明这个问题，我们应先澄清人们对共产主义的“各取所需”的分配制度所常发生的三种误解：第一，他们错误地认为，未来共产主义社会实行各取所需，人们就可以任意地各取所需，毫不受社会的计划管理。这不是共产主义而是无政府主义；第二，他们错误地认为，“各取所需”的分配制度，是在生产力极高度发展等条件完全具备以后的某一个早晨一下子实行的，而不是在社会主义建设时期，以逐渐的量变和各种局部质变的过程积累而成的，因而把它看成是遥远的并与当前社会主义建设截然分开的事情，这是一种形而上学的观点；第三，他们错误地认为，在进到共产主义社会以后，生活上所需的一切东西，人们可以一样地无限取用和享受。这种观点是违反事物发展的辩证规律的，它把未来共产主义社会的生产以及从属于生产的消费或需要，看成停滞不变的东西。其实，共产主义的分配制度（各取所需），将是这样形成起来和这样发展下去的：（一）在社会主义阶段，随着生产力的大大发展，当某一种生活资料已经到达充分丰富的程度，它就可以先开始逐渐按“各取所需”的原则来供应，从低价供应变为免费供应，并且没有限额，但是应受社会计划管理。所以从社会主义的“按劳分配”到共产主义的“各取所需”的变革，是逐步实现的。（二）在进入社会主义社会以后，虽然原有的各种生活资料都已丰富到了可以实行“各取所需”的程度，但是生产的发展是无限的，它会不断引起人们新的消费需要。人的需要又反过来会促进生产的发展，例如，生产出了电视机，我们就想有电视机；将来火箭等科学生产技术的发展能使人们向月球、火星作星际旅行时，人们就会在生活节目单上列上星际旅行的要求。不难了解，新产品在开始时是不能一下子就同老产品一样丰富的，这部分产品开始就不能无限额供应，甚至开始时只能让社会的劳动模范和先进人物去享受，以后新产品丰富起来了，它就可以同其他生活用品一样由社会开放为“各取所需”的新增项目。
    根据以上所述，即可看出目前人民公社实行的新供给制，是在按人口和在基本上人人平等这一方面与共产主义的分配制度有共同之点，但是它还不是共产主义的“各取所需”的分配制度。有些人以前述共产主义的“各取所需”是逐渐实现的，它在社会主义阶段即可开始出现，以及它在未来共产主义阶段也有某些限制等两个理由为根据，认为人民公社目前所实行的有限额的粮食、伙食或基本生活资料供给制，就是共产主义“各取所需”制度的开始，这自然是不对的或不恰切的。因为“各取所需”的分配制度，虽然在社会主义的一定发展阶段上即可从某些个别的生活资料开始，但是各取所需的特点是既按人口，又无限额，不像人民公社所实行的供给制，虽按人口，但有限额。至于未来共产主义社会实行“各取所需”时，仍有个别新产品要暂时限额供给，其性质和情况同人民公社目前实行粮食、伙食或基本生活资料的定额供给不能混为一谈。但是忽视或否认供给制中的共产主义因素或萌芽，那也是不对的。前一种人的看法，是过于美化供给制，而将共产主义的分配制度简易化，它会影响人们为实现共产主义而不断奋斗。后一种人的看法，是对社会主义的“按劳分配”和共产主义的“各取所需”均有迷信，看不出我国过去和现在所实行的供给制的优越性，以及现在所开始的新供给制可以加速向共产主义过渡。
