    Hongqi Commune in Longhui County Does Well in Diversified Economy; Commune Income Increases, Members Find it Convenient to Spend Money
    (Our Newspaper) How can people's communes, after solving the problem of food for their members, further address the needs of members for spending money and diversifying their lives? Hongqi People's Commune in Longhui County, Hunan Province, has a good approach to developing a diversified economy.
    This commune was established in early September by merging seven townships and one hundred and seventeen agricultural cooperatives. After its establishment, the commune party committee continued to lead members in developing a diversified economy on the existing basis. So far, the commune can obtain a net income of more than 2,657,000 yuan from diversified operations. The commune has money to pay wages to its members, and has also repaid the 470,000 yuan loan it owed before. It has also prepared a large amount of funds for agricultural production next year.
    The predecessor of this commune was an agricultural cooperative in the county that was doing well in diversified operations. However, after the establishment of the commune, the development of a diversified economy encountered resistance from some commune cadres and members. They believed that this year's grain production had increased, and diversified operations could be done or not done; some people emphasized the shortage of labor, and believed that it was impossible to engage in diversified operations.
    In order to clear the way for the development of a diversified economy, the commune party committee promptly led cadres and members of the commune to launch a debate: Why should we engage in a diversified economy? Is it okay for members to only eat, without eating oil, salt, or meat, and without spending money? This made everyone realize the benefits of developing a diversified economy. Some members used to think that it was only glorious to engage in industry and agriculture, and not glorious to engage in a diversified economy. Now they have also changed their minds and voluntarily asked to be breeders and participate in other production activities.
    On the basis of unified understanding, the commune party committee took specific measures, established a diversified management office, and tapped labor potential. They ran public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens well, and successively freed up more than 12,000 people to participate in industrial, agricultural, and sideline production. They also organized more than 13,000 students to implement half-work and half-study programs, and organized some residents and business personnel in small market towns to participate, which basically solved the shortage of labor. According to the diversified production projects, the commune established 975 specialized teams, with more than 4,100 people fixed to engage in diversified operations. By the end of October, in addition to continuing to strengthen the management of the more than 11,000 mu of cash crops that had been planted in the past to ensure timely harvesting, the commune also purchased more than 4,100 pigs, more than 600 sheep, and 94 boxes of bees; expanded tea gardens and vegetables by 600 mu each; and added a vegetable production team, planting 600 mu of vegetables. In early November, the commune's pigs had grown to more than 4,400, goats to more than 1,700, and bees to 268 boxes. Due to increased income, the commune has paid wages to its members.
    The commune has also done a lot of basic construction work. The whole commune organized more than 60 carpenters to repair pig farms and silkworm farms in a timely manner. In order to prevent and control livestock diseases, a veterinary station has been established, and pigs, sheep and other livestock are now well-fed and managed. The commune has also set up seventy-three small factories and mines, small-scale industries such as rain gear, rice milling, soil fertilizer, cement, paper making, and brewing. (Wei Changwang)

### 隆回县红旗公社多种经营做得好  公社收入增加社员用钱方便

    隆回县红旗公社多种经营做得好
    公社收入增加社员用钱方便
    本报讯  人民公社在解决社员的吃饭问题以后，如何进一步解决社员的用钱问题和生活多样化要求的需要？湖南省隆回县红旗人民公社开展多种经营的办法搞得好。
    这个公社是9月初旬由七个乡镇、一百一十七个农业社合并建成的。建社后，公社党委就在原有基础上继续领导社员开展了多种经营。到目前为止，全社从多种经营中可得到纯收入二百六十五万七千多元，公社有钱可以发给社员工资，并还清了以前所欠的四十七万元贷款，还为明年的农业生产准备了大批资金。
    这个公社的前身，是全县开展多种经营较好的农业社。但是，在建公社以后，对开展多种经营，曾遇到一部分社干和社员的抵触。他们认为：今年的粮食增了产，多种经营可搞可不搞；有的人强调劳动力紧张，认为不可能搞多种经营。
    公社党委为了给发展多种经营扫清道路，便及时领导全社干部和社员开展了辩论：为什么要搞多种经营？社员只吃饭，不吃油盐、不吃肉，不用钱行不行？使大家认识到开展多种经营的好处。有些社员曾认为只有搞工业、农业才光荣，搞多种经营不光荣，现在也转变了，自动要求去当饲养员和参加其它各种生产。
    在统一认识的基础上，公社党委又采取具体措施，成立了多种经营办公室，挖掘了劳动潜力。他们办好公共食堂和托儿所、幼儿园，先后腾出了一万二千多人参加了工、农、副业生产，还组织了一万三千多个学生实行半工半读，又组织小集镇的一些居民和商业人员参加，这就基本上解决了劳动力紧张的状况。公社根据多种经营的生产项目，成立了九百七十五个专业队，固定四千一百多人专搞多种经营。到10月底，全社除了对过去已种的一万一千多亩经济作物继续加强管理、保证及时收割以外，并买进了生猪四千一百多头，羊六百多只，蜜蜂九十四箱；扩大了茶园和蔬菜各六百亩；增加了一个蔬菜生产队，种菜六百亩。11月上旬，公社的生猪已发展到四千四百多头，山羊一千七百多只，蜜蜂二百六十八箱。由于收入增多，公社已向社员发了工资。
    这个公社还做了许多基本建设工作。全公社组织六十多名木匠，及时修好了养猪场、养蚕场。为了防治牲畜发生疾病，已建立了兽医站，现在猪、羊等牲畜都饲养管理得很好。公社现在还办起了七十三个小厂矿，雨具、碾米、土化肥、水泥、造纸、酿酒等小型工业。　（魏昌旺）
