    Changtu County Commune-Run Breeding Stock Farm

    (Our dispatch) How to solve the problem of insufficient breeding stock during the Great Leap Forward in animal husbandry production? Changtu County, Liaoning Province, has found a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical. The county has adopted the mass line method, relying on the masses to establish its own breeding stock base, enabling commune-run breeding stock farms to flourish everywhere. As of now, all the people's communes in the county have established 65 breeding horse, cattle, pig, and sheep farms, professionally raising and directionally breeding more than 1,230 head of breeding horses, cattle, pigs, and sheep. In addition, the people's communes have also established more than 40 breeding chicken and duck and breeding rabbit farms, raising more than 23,000 breeding chickens, ducks, and rabbits.

    In recent years, with the help of the state, Changtu County has transferred more than 300 head of excellent Soviet breeding horses and local excellent breeding males, which has greatly developed the county's livestock breeding and improvement work. However, the existing breeding males still cannot meet the needs of the current Great Leap Forward in animal husbandry, and because of the long-term tendency to emphasize improvement and neglect breeding management in livestock breeding work, the physical fitness of the improved young livestock is generally not strong enough. The Changtu County Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that the people's communes should establish their own young livestock breeding farms and breeding stock bases to meet the requirements of developing animal husbandry in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. On the basis of universally realizing livestock breeding improvement, the county's animal husbandry production will move towards a new stage of selection, improvement, and comprehensive leap forward. So far, the county has already bred more than 100 excellent foals, which, in addition to being kept in the county as breeding stock, have also supported neighboring counties that lack breeding stock. Next year, the county plans to breed another 3,000 head of breeding males such as horses, cattle, and donkeys, and to provide 500 head to support other areas.

    In order to run the existing breeding stock farms well and develop the breeding stock business, the county has newly established a horse breeding station, which is responsible for technically guiding the breeding work of various livestock farms. The township and commune party committees also have a secretary in charge of this work, with people responsible at all levels. In order to ensure the quality of breeding stock, various livestock farms have established a strict inspection system for the selection of young livestock; the managers in the farms have also been carefully selected. For the feeding of breeding stock, the method of "four fixes" has been universally implemented: fixed personnel (breeders, herders), fixed livestock, fixed forage (a certain amount), and the establishment of scientific feeding and management systems.

### 昌图县社社办种畜场

    昌图县社社办种畜场
    本报讯　在畜牧业生产大跃进中，怎样解决种畜不足的问题？辽宁省昌图县找到了一条多、快、好、省的道路。这个县采取群众路线的方法，依靠群众建立自己的种畜基地，使社办种畜场遍地开花。到目前为止，全县各人民公社已经建立种马、种牛、种猪、种羊场六十五处，专业饲养、定向培育的种马、种牛、种猪、种羊一千二百三十多头。此外，各人民公社还建立了种鸡鸭、种兔场四十多处，饲养种鸡鸭、种兔两万三千多只。
    昌图县几年来在国家帮助下，从外调进苏联优良种马和当地原有优良种公畜三百多头，使全县牲畜繁殖改良工作有了很大发展。但是现有的种公畜仍然不能适应当前畜牧业大跃进的需要，并且由于在牲畜繁殖工作中长期存在着重视改良忽视培育管理的偏向，改良后的幼畜体质普遍不够健壮。中共昌图县委指出：人民公社要建立自己幼畜培育场和种畜基地，以适应多、快、好、省地发展畜牧业的要求。在普遍实现牲畜繁殖改良的基础上，使全县畜牧业生产走向选育提高和全面跃进的新阶段。到目前为止，全县仅已培育出场的优良马驹，就有一百多头，这些马驹，除留本县做种畜以外，还支援了附近缺少种畜的县份。明年这个县计划要再培育出马、牛、驴等种公畜三千头，拿出五百头支援外地。
    为了办好现有种畜场，发展种畜事业，县里新成立了马匹育种站，负责在技术上指导各种畜场的育种工作。乡、社党委也都有一名书记专管这项工作，层层有人负责。各种畜场为了保证种畜的质量，在幼畜选育上建立了严格的检查制度；场内的管理人员，也都经过了认真的挑选。对于种畜的饲养，普遍实行了定员（饲养员、放牧员）、定畜、定草料（一定的数量）、定立科学的饲养管理制度等四定的办法。
