Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 27th November. A large number of outstanding individuals from all fronts in Guizhou Province have been accepted into the Chinese Communist Party. As of November 15th, the province has admitted a total of 10,230 activists into the Party.

During the Great Leap Forward, Party organizations at all levels in Guizhou Province attached great importance to Party building work. They conducted special studies and arrangements for Party building during the mass campaign for steel production and the "Four Autumns" production movement, adopting a proactive and cautious attitude to strengthen the Party's ranks. The activists who were admitted into the Party generally had a high level of political awareness, made outstanding contributions in their respective positions, maintained good connections with the masses, and were able to actively implement the Party's various calls and instructions. Zhou Zeshan, a worker who joined the Party on the iron and steel front, once encountered a damaged furnace opening. He and the workers together dug out the red-hot raw materials from the furnace, then wetted his clothes and crawled into the furnace to repair it. The temperature inside the furnace was very high, and he was sweating profusely, his skin burned red, but he persisted for an hour and a half before repairing the furnace. Guo Aimin, another cadre who joined the Party on the iron and steel front, stayed by the furnace for six consecutive days and nights, mastered the complete set of pig iron smelting techniques in a short period of time, and patiently taught them to other workers. Wherever he went, the workers affectionately called him Teacher Guo. Among the more than 200 new Party members admitted in Meitan County, there were 149 advanced producers, 13 outstanding teachers, and 64 who had won honorary titles in various work positions.

    大跃进中重视建党工作
    贵州吸收一万多名积极分子入党
    新华社贵阳27日电　贵州省有大批各个战线上的优秀分子被吸收加入中国共产党。到11月15日止，全省共吸收了一万零二百三十名积极分子入党。
    贵州省各级党组织在大跃进中非常重视建党工作，在全民大办钢铁和“四秋”生产运动中都对建党工作进行了专门的研究和布置，采取积极、慎重的态度来壮大党的队伍。被吸收入党的积极分子一般都有较高的政治觉悟，在各个岗位上作出了出色的贡献，同群众有较好的联系，并且能积极执行党的各种号召和指示。在钢铁战线上入党的工人周泽山，一次炉口坏了，他就和工人们一道，把炉内烧得通红的原料掏出来，然后弄湿了自己身上的衣裳，钻进炉内修理，当时炉内温度很高，他全身汗水直流，皮肤被烫得发红，但他一直坚持了一个半小时，修好炉子才出来。另一名在钢铁战线上入党的干部郭爱民曾连续六昼夜守在炉旁，在短时间内就掌握了冶炼生铁的全套技术，并耐心地教给其他工人，他走到那里，工人们都亲切地称他为郭老师。湄潭县吸收的二百多名新党员中有一百四十九名先进生产者、十三名优秀教师，有六十四人在各种工作岗位上获得了光荣称号。
