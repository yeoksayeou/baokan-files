The People's Daily report: This reporter Li Jiuzhe reported: The Nanchang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Jiangxi Province, as the autumn harvest was coming to an end, vigorously grasped rural sideline production to increase the cash income of the people's communes, allowing farmers to have pocket money.

Due to the tense steel production and heavy autumn harvesting and planting tasks, various sideline productions in Nanchang County had been suspended for nearly two months. Farmers generally reported that they had no pocket money to spend, and the commune had no money to pay wages. In view of this situation, the Nanchang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party started grasping sideline production in late last month, and the situation has greatly improved in the past half month. The number of pigs raised in the county has increased by 8,000, 39,000 mu of vegetables have been planted, 30,000 dan of fish have been caught, and various processing sideline industries such as pickling pickles have been established. In this way, the problem of farmers lacking pocket money was solved, and the commune also had money to pay wages. The farmers were overjoyed and worked even harder.

The basic experience of the Nanchang County Committee in grasping sideline production is: putting politics in command, strengthening leadership, and comprehensive arrangement. The reason why sideline production was abandoned in the previous stage was due to the tense steel production tasks. However, it was also important because some cadres regarded sideline production as dispensable and blindly shouted about the shortage of labor. To solve this problem, the county party secretary led a working group to find out the situation and convened a cadre meeting for research. At the meeting, the idea that "sideline production is dispensable" was first criticized, pointing out that this was a manifestation of weak mass viewpoint of not caring about the production of the masses and not paying attention to solving the difficulties in the lives of the masses. Then, a comprehensive arrangement was made for the labor force. According to the current production tasks, the county party committee decided to use 10% for sideline production, 20% for field management and manure accumulation, 30% for steel, and 40% for water conservancy construction. After overall planning, the labor force can adapt to the needs of multiple productions. The leading force was also divided into three battle lines of command—namely, steel, water conservancy, field management, and sideline production; and a member of the county party committee and deputy county head was appointed to specifically lead sideline production. The people's communes also specifically arranged the labor force and organized various professional teams. Sideline production was divided into professional teams for vegetable planting, raising livestock, fishing, and processing. In this way, sideline production was grasped. Ensure that Rapeseed Yields Pass the Test Next Year: Plant More Rapeseed and Cultivate Rapeseed Well. Responsible person of the Ministry of Agriculture Pointed Out That Planting Area Must Be Expanded and Winter Management Must Be Strengthened.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: The Ministry of Agriculture requires rapeseed production areas to strive to complete the rapeseed planting plan, and on this premise, to cultivate every mu well, and to carry out field management activities as soon as possible, in order to ensure that rapeseed yields pass the test next year.

This requirement was put forward by the person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture when he gave a talk to this agency reporter on the rapeseed planting situation. He said that the planting area of ​​winter rapeseed this year is larger than last year, and the planting quality is good. According to statistics on the 10th of this month, fifteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, including Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Shanghai, have planted more than 45,440,000 mu of rapeseed (including the converted area of ​​seedling transplanting), an increase of more than 9,700,000 mu over the winter planting area last year. Most of the rapeseed fields in various places have undergone deep plowing, a large amount of base fertilizer has been applied, dense planting has been implemented, and the planting area of ​​improved varieties has been expanded. These have provided good conditions for achieving a great leap forward in rapeseed production next year.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture then pointed out: However, many regions have not completed this year's winter rapeseed planting plan, and some provinces have been planting very slowly. Among the above-mentioned fifteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, except for the four provinces and cities of Hubei, Sichuan, Henan, and Shanghai, which have completed or over-completed the planned planting area, the remaining provinces and regions have not completed the plan. Some provinces planned to plant 1 million mu or 2 million mu, but only planted 30,000 to 50,000 mu. This phenomenon is a serious threat to the increase in rapeseed production.

The person in charge said that in response to the above situation, all possible measures must be taken to strive to plant more and strive to complete the planned planting area. In this way, there will be a reliable guarantee for rapeseed to pass the test next year. He then pointed out: At present, although it is the beginning of winter, the timely sowing period of rapeseed has passed in most areas, but there are still ways to expand the planting area. These methods are: (1). For those who implement seedling transplanting, transplanting is currently underway. The cultivated rapeseed seedlings should be fully utilized, and on the premise of ensuring dense planting, the transplanting area should be expanded as much as possible, and one more mu should be planted. (2). For direct-sown rapeseed, some areas are currently in the period of thinning and evenly distributing seedlings. The thinned seedlings should be fully utilized and transplanted to expand the planting area. This method has great potential. According to past experience, the seedlings thinned from one mu of direct-sown rapeseed can be transplanted to about two mu. (3). In areas with warm climates in the south, the sowing work has not yet ended, and efforts should be made to plant more.

The person in charge said that the important key to whether the above methods can be promoted is to put politics in command and strengthen ideological work. Only by strengthening political work and solving the ideological problems that have prevented many regions from completing the planting plan can these remedial measures be accepted and actively implemented by the masses. The person in charge said: One of the reasons why many regions have not completed the planting plan well is said to be for "planting less, producing high yields, and harvesting more"; in order to "reduce the replanting area to increase the yield per unit area." The person in charge pointed out: The policy of "planting less, planting well, producing high yields, and harvesting more" is completely correct, but when applying this policy, we must consider the planting ratio of various crops. The planting area of ​​oil crops in the past and present is not large in proportion, and the continuous improvement of national economic construction and people's lives has put forward new requirements for oil production. In order to meet this requirement, in the current situation, the planting area of ​​oil crops, including rapeseed, should be expanded and high-yielding. All localities should fully recognize this point and conduct in-depth mobilization among the masses. Secondly, some cadres and farmers in some areas still believe that rapeseed yields are low and are unwilling to plant it. This is the result of conservative thinking. The facts of local and national high-yield rapeseed "satellites" and large-scale high-yield crops should be presented for education, and minds should be liberated so as to move forward by leaps and bounds. Otherwise, not only will the remedial measures not be implemented and the planting area will remain small, but it will be difficult to guarantee high yields for those that have already been planted without the guidance of high-yield thinking. As for the problem of labor shortage, the person in charge pointed out that it can be solved as long as comprehensive arrangements are made, as has been proven by many advanced examples, and active measures should be taken to solve it.

The person in charge said that while striving to ensure the completion of the rapeseed planting plan, in order to achieve a greater leap forward in rapeseed production next year, and to ensure that rapeseed passes the test next year, we must strengthen the field management of rapeseed overwintering at present. All localities should immediately organize rapeseed field management professional teams to universally apply fertilizer to rapeseed fields, combine with middle tillage and soil cultivation, do a good job in clearing ditches and draining water, carry out frost prevention and seedling protection, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests, and resolutely prevent third-class seedlings from overwintering. He emphasized that in field management, special attention should be paid to managing the large-scale high-yield fields that account for 10% to 15% of the rapeseed area. Whether the yield plan of these high-yield fields can be realized has a huge impact on how much the total rapeseed yield will increase next year.

The person in charge finally said that accepting the experience and lessons of this winter rapeseed sowing work, all localities should arrange the sowing work of spring rapeseed as early as possible, and should strive to expand the planting area.

    领导分线指挥　劳力统筹安排
    南昌县大抓副业生产
    本报讯　记者李久泽报道：中共江西省南昌县委在秋收将要结束的时候，大抓农村副业生产，增加人民公社的现金收入，让农民都有零用钱。
    由于钢铁生产紧张，秋收秋种任务繁重，南昌县各项副业生产曾经停顿了将近两个月，农民普遍反映没有零用钱花，社里也没有钱发工资。鉴于这种情况，中共南昌县委在上月下旬抓起了副业生产，半个月来情况大为好转。全县养猪增加了八千头，种蔬菜三万九千亩，捕鱼三万担，还办起了腌咸菜等多种加工副业。这样，农民缺零用钱的困难解决了，公社也有钱发工资了。农民欢天喜地，干劲更大了。
    南昌县委抓副业的基本经验是：政治挂帅，加强领导，全面安排。前一个阶段所以把副业丢了，钢铁生产任务紧张固然是一个原因，但是部分干部把副业看成是可有可无，盲目叫喊劳动力紧张，也是重要原因。为解决这个问题，县委书记带领工作组下去摸清情况，并召开干部会议进行研究。会上首先批判了“副业可有可无”思想，指出这是不关心群众生产、不注意解决群众生活困难的群众观点薄弱的表现。接着，对劳动力作了全面安排。根据当前各项生产任务，县委决定以10％搞副业，20％搞田间管理和积肥，30％搞钢铁，40％修水利。经过统筹安排，劳动力已可以适应多项生产的需要。领导力量也分三条战线指挥——即钢铁、水利、田间管理及副业；并指定一位县委委员兼副县长专门领导副业生产。各人民公社也具体安排了劳动力，组织了各种专业队。副业生产中又分种菜、养队、捕鱼、加工等专业队，这样，副业生产便抓起来了。保证油菜籽产量在明年过关多种油菜种好油菜农业部负责人指出必须扩大种植面积、加强越冬管理
    新华社17日讯　农业部要求油菜籽产区必须力争完成油菜播种计划，在这个前提下要亩亩种好，并且要及早开展田间管理运动，以便保证油菜籽产量在明年过关。
    这个要求是农业部负责人就油菜播种情况向本社记者发表谈话时提出的。他说，今年越冬油菜的种植面积比去年大，而且播种质量好。据本月10日统计，陕西、江苏、安徽、浙江、福建、河南、湖北、湖南、江西、广东、广西、四川、云南、贵州和上海等十五个省、市和自治区已经播种油菜四千五百四十多万亩（包括育苗移栽的折算面积），比去年冬播面积增加九百七十万亩以上。各地的油菜田大多进行了深翻，施了大量底肥，实行了密植，并且扩大了良种种植面积，这些都为明年油菜产量实现大跃进提供了良好的条件。
    农业部负责人接着指出：但是，很多地区却并未完成今年的冬种油菜计划，有些省播种进度十分缓慢。在上述十五个省、市和自治区中，除湖北、四川、河南、上海四省、市已经完成或超额完成计划种植面积外，其余各省、区都还没有完成计划。有些省计划种植一百万亩或二百万亩，实际种的才达三、五万亩，这种现象对油菜增产是一个严重的威胁。
    负责人说，针对上述情况，必须采取一切可能采取的办法，力争多种一点，力争完成计划种植面积，这样，明年油菜过关才有可靠的保证。他接着指出：当前，虽然已经立冬，大部分地区油菜适时播种期已经过去，但是，还是有办法扩大种植面积的。这些办法是：（一）、实行育苗移栽的，当前正在移栽。对育成的油菜秧苗要充分加以利用，在保证密植的前提下，要尽可能地扩大移栽面积，多栽一亩是一亩。（二）、直播的油菜，当前有些地区正是间苗匀苗时期，对间出的秧苗要充分利用起来，进行移栽，以扩大种植面积。这项办法潜力很大，据以往经验，一亩直播油菜间出的苗可移栽二亩左右。（三）、南方气候温暖的地方，目前播种工作还未结束，应当力争多种一些。
    负责人说，上述一些办法能否推行的重要关键，是政治挂帅，加强思想工作。只有加强了政治工作，解决了促使很多地区不能完成播种计划的思想问题，这些补救办法才能为群众接受，积极执行。负责人说：很多地区播种计划完成得不好的原因之一，据说是为了“少种、高产、多收”；为了“减少复种面积，以提高单位面积产量”。负责人指出：“少种、种好、高产、多收”这项方针是完全正确的，但是，在运用这条方针时，却不能不考虑各种作物的种植比例。油料作物过去和现在的种植面积都是比例不大的，而国民经济建设和人民生活不断的提高，都对油料生产提出了新的要求，为了满足这种要求，在当前来说，油料作物包括油菜的种植面积是既要扩大，又要高产。各地应该充分认识到这一点，在群众中进行深入的动员。其次，有些地区的部分干部和农民还是认为油菜产量低，不愿种。这是保守思想作祟，应当摆出今年当地和全国各地油菜高产“卫星”和大面积丰产的事实进行教育，解放思想，才能大踏步地前进。不然，不仅补救办法推行不通，种植面积依然很少，而且已经播种的，没有以高产思想作指导，也很难保证达到高产。至于劳力紧张的问题，负责人指出，只要进行全面安排是可以解决的，这已为不少先进的事例所证明，应当积极地采取措施解决。
    负责人说，在力争保证完成油菜种植计划的同时，要想明年油菜产量实现更大的跃进，要想保证明年油菜过关，在当前，必须加强油菜越冬的田间管理。各地应当立即组织油菜田间管理专业队，对油菜田普遍追施肥料，结合中耕培土，做好清沟排渍，开展防冻保苗和防治病虫害的工作，要坚决不让三类苗过冬。他强调指出：在田间管理中，要特别注意管好占油菜面积10％到15％的大面积高额丰产田，这些丰产田的产量计划能否实现，对明年油菜总产量增加多少起着巨大的作用。
    负责人最后说，接受这次冬种油菜播种工作的经验教训，各地应及早安排春种油菜的播种工作，并应力争扩大种植面积。
