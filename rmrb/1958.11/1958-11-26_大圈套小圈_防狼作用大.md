According to the Qinghai Daily, Dongfeng People's Commune in Tongren County, Qinghai Province, has achieved large livestock with enclosures and young livestock with sheds.

The commune built more than 100 adobe wall enclosures, with very sturdy walls. Generally, the base of the wall is 1.5 meters wide, the top is 0.5 meters wide, and the wall is 1.6 meters high. The tops of the enclosure walls are tied with trip ropes and also have dummies to deter wolves. At the same time, 47 cattle sheds and 34 lamb sheds were built, achieving large livestock with enclosures and young livestock with sheds.

In the process of carrying out this work, the commune also utilized the wisdom of the masses to design a "large circle inside a small circle" method of building enclosures. The large circles for horses and cattle are on the outside, and the sheep pens are in the middle. The advantages are: it saves manpower, as only the entrances and exits at the four corners need to be guarded; the horse and cattle pens are on the outside, and the sheep pens are in the middle, which can prevent wolves from suddenly attacking the sheep.

    大圈套小圈　防狼作用大
    据青海日报消息　青海同仁县东风人民公社做到了大畜有圈，幼畜有棚。
    这个公社共打板墙圈一百多个，圈墙十分坚固，一般墙脚宽一公尺半，顶宽半公尺，墙高一公尺六。圈墙的顶端四周，拴有绊绳，还扎有假人，用来防狼。同时，修牛棚四十七个和羊羔棚三十四个，做到了大畜有圈、幼畜有棚。
    该社在进行这一工作的过程中，还发挥群众智慧，设计出一种“大圈套小圈”的打圈法。马、牛大圈在四周，羊圈在当中。优点是：省人力，只要四个角上的出入口有人看守就成了；马、牛圈在外层，羊圈在中间，能防止狼突然袭击羊群。
