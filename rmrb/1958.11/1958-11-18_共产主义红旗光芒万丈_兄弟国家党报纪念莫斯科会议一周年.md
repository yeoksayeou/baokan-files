    The Communist Red Flag Shines Radiantly
    Brotherly Countries' Party Newspapers Commemorate the First Anniversary of the Moscow Conference
    Albanian "Zëri i Popullit" Article
    Revisionism Suffers a Heavy Blow
    The Albanian newspaper "Zëri i Popullit" published an article on the 13th entitled "An Important Anniversary of the International Communist Movement," commemorating this day of great historical significance. The article said that the course of world events in the short span of a year has proven the great significance and correctness of the two declarations issued by the Moscow Conference.
    The article pointed out that the Moscow Conference marked a new stage in the international communist movement. The conference not only demonstrated that the international communist movement had successfully overcome the offensive of the imperialist bourgeoisie, but also showed the ideological unity of the communist and workers' parties of all countries, and demonstrated that they are full of the vitality to victoriously complete the historical mission entrusted to them by mankind.
    The article then condemned the actions of modern revisionism, especially Yugoslav revisionism, in opposing the Moscow Conference declarations over the past year. The article pointed out that the communist movement has given revisionism a heavy blow in the past year, and the communist movement is now more consolidated than ever before.
    The article went on to point out that in the past year, people have seen with their own eyes that the principles contained in the Moscow Conference declarations have become the driving force of the world's progressive forces. Despite the desperate and often dangerous struggles of imperialism, they have not been able to reverse the wheels of history. The article said: "The winds of imperialism are waning, while the east wind—the powerful and life-giving wind of the socialist camp—is blowing more strongly, more freshly, and more full of hope." Moreover, the day when only the east wind blows in the whole world "is not far away."
    Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" Editorial
    The Advance of the New World is Irresistible
    The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published an editorial on the 16th entitled "Historical Meetings and Documents," commemorating the first anniversary of the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries. The editorial said that the Declaration of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the "Peace Manifesto" adopted by the Moscow Conference strengthened the international unity of the Marxist-Leninist parties of the socialist countries and laid a new ideological and political foundation suitable for the modern situation for the further development of this unity. They armed the communists and all progressive humanity with the firm confidence that peace, democracy, and socialism will inevitably triumph throughout the world. The situation in the past year "has very clearly shown that the Marxist-Leninist principles developed in the two declarations are extremely correct and have great vitality."
    The editorial said that when the Communist and Workers' Parties held the Moscow Conference, the imperialist reactionary forces clamored that the international communist movement was experiencing a crisis and was heading for decline and disintegration. The reactionary forces hoped that the revisionists who had emerged in some fraternal parties would be able to break the communist forces and tried their best to support the divisive activities of these elements. However, the hopes of the imperialist reactionary forces were completely dashed. In the past year, the international communist movement has not only not declined and disintegrated, but on the contrary, a new ideological upsurge has emerged.
    The editorial concluded by saying that the Moscow Conference greatly promoted the struggle against capitalism and for the construction of socialism and communism. This struggle and construction will be increasingly strengthened in the future. The process of the world's transition from capitalist society to socialism, which was opened by the victory of the Russian October Revolution, is developing and advancing irresistibly. "No force can stop the victorious development of this great historical process."
    Hungarian "Népszabadság" Editorial
    The Socialist Camp Increasingly Gains the Upper Hand
    The Hungarian newspaper "Népszabadság" published an editorial on the 14th entitled "Giving Peace to the World," commemorating the first anniversary of the declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the "Peace Manifesto" of the sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties.
    The editorial pointed out that these two declarations are the most important documents of the contemporary communist movement, a comprehensive program for building socialism and striving for peace, and a milestone on the road to the upsurge of the communist and national liberation movements and the peaceful struggle of the people of all countries.
    The editorial said that the practice of the past year has proven the correctness of the two documents' assessment of the international situation. In the past year, we can see how the forces of socialism and peace are constantly moving forward, and how imperialism is continuously losing its positions. The imperialist countries are powerless to prevent the continued collapse of the colonial system.
    The editorial said that the Declaration of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries pointed out: "Under the current conditions, the main danger is revisionism." The facts of the past year have proven this statement to be correct. The unanimous opposition of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries to modern revisionism, which is most fully reflected in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, is proof of the unity of the international communist movement.
    The editorial concluded by saying that the socialist camp is increasingly gaining new advantages over the decadent imperialist camp. This is the most important content of our time, and this is the irreversible direction of historical development. The ultimate victory of socialism throughout the world is an inevitable law.
    "Neues Deutschland" Editorial
    The People are Stronger Than Imperialism
    The newspaper "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial on the 14th entitled "An Important Anniversary," commemorating the first anniversary of the publication of the Moscow Declaration. The editorial said that the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries held a year ago was one of the most important events in the history of the international workers' movement since the end of World War II. The lofty ideas of the "Peace Manifesto" adopted by the conference have become a practical force, and these ideas have inspired the masses of people in many countries.
    The editorial pointed out that this summer, the people's movement prevented the imperialist aggression against Iraq and forced the US and British aggressors to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. These new pieces of evidence can also prove that "today, the people are stronger than imperialism, and war can be avoided."
    The editorial pointed out that the enemies of the workers' class movement cheered for the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia who put forward a program that was opposed to the Moscow Declaration. The editorial said that the purpose of this thoroughly revisionist program was obviously to split the workers' class movement and create divisions within the socialist camp. However, "no Communist or Workers' Party followed the Yugoslav revisionists, and all parties refuted and condemned the revisionist views in Belgrade and in their own ranks."
    Mongolian "Ünen" Editorial
    Our Ranks are Expanding Day by Day
    The Mongolian newspaper "Ünen" published an editorial on the 14th entitled "The Banner of Marxism-Leninism is Flying High," commemorating the first anniversary of the Moscow Conference of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties and the publication of the two declarations of the conference. The editorial said that the two declarations issued by the Moscow Conference have indelible significance for the development of the theory and practice of the world communist movement. The past year has proven that the conclusions and guidelines made in these two declarations "are completely correct and wise."
    The editorial said that the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries have become more closely united in the struggle against modern revisionism. They unanimously criticized the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, waged a tenacious struggle to protect the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and exposed the thorough revisionist content of the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the behavior of the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in betraying the interests of the workers' class.
    The editorial concluded by saying: With the increasing consolidation of the socialist camp, the people of all countries have become more aware of the superiority of this camp. The editorial said: "The ranks of our friends and partners in all countries are expanding day by day, and the banner of communism is flying higher and higher in the sky, its bright red color emitting a radiant light as the dawn of a new era of human happiness."
    Czech "Rudé Právo" Editorial
    Communist Ideals Will Surely Triumph
    The Czechoslovak newspaper "Rudé Právo" published an editorial on the 15th entitled "The Victory Banner of Communism," commemorating the first anniversary of the publication of the Moscow Declaration.
    The editorial said that the experience gained in the past year has absolutely confirmed the correctness of the Marxist analysis made in the Moscow talks.
    The editorial said: The Moscow Declaration has become the programmatic document of the entire international communist movement. On the basis of this document, on the basis of absolute loyalty to Marxism-Leninism, the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries has been consolidated in the past period. All Communist and Workers' Parties have stood up in absolute unity against modern revisionism, which remains the main danger today. This consensus was particularly evident in the resolute rejection and open, principled criticism of the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, in which modern revisionism is most clearly and comprehensively expressed. No Communist Party has agreed with these anti-Marxist, anti-Leninist views.
    The editorial concluded by pointing out: The practice of the struggle for socialism and peace has proven that the momentous programmatic documents adopted at the Moscow Conference a year ago are completely correct. The achievements made by the Communist and Workers' Parties in the past year, the new achievements in building and strengthening the new socialist system, fill the ordinary people of the world with confidence that the lofty ideals of socialism and communism will surely triumph.

    共产主义红旗光芒万丈
    兄弟国家党报纪念莫斯科会议一周年
    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”文章
    修正主义遭到沉重打击
    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”13日发表了一篇题为“国际共产主义运动的一个重要纪念日”的文章，纪念这一有重大历史意义的日子。文章说，过去短短一年内世界事件的进程，证明了莫斯科会议发表的两个宣言的重大意义和正确性。
    文章指出，莫斯科会议标志着国际共产主义运动的新阶段。这次会议不仅显示了国际共产主义运动已经成功地战胜了帝国主义资产阶级的进攻，并且表明了各国共产党和工人党在思想上的一致，表明它们充满了胜利完成人类所赋予它们的历史使命的活力。
    文章接着谴责现代修正主义特别是南斯拉夫修正主义一年来反对莫斯科会议宣言的行动。文章指出，共产主义运动一年来已经给了修正主义以沉重的打击，共产主义运动现在已经比已往任何时候都更加巩固了。
    文章接着指出，一年来，人们亲眼看到，莫斯科会议宣言所包含的原则已经成了世界进步力量的动力。尽管帝国主义进行不顾一切的和常常是危险的挣扎，但是，它们并没有能够倒转历史的车轮。文章说：“帝国主义的风正日益衰微，而东风——社会主义阵营的强有力的和赋与生命力的风却吹得更有力、更清新、更充满希望了。”而且，在全世界只吹东风的日子“已经不远了”。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”社论
    新世界前进势不可挡
    保加利亚“工人事业报”16日以“历史性的会议和文件”为题发表社论，纪念各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议一周年。社论说，莫斯科会议通过的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言与“和平宣言”加强了社会主义国家马克思列宁主义政党的国际团结，为进一步发展这种团结奠定了适应于现代形势的、新的思想和政治基础，它们以和平、民主和社会主义必然在全世界胜利的坚定信心武装了共产党人和全体进步人类。一年来的情况“非常清楚地表明，在两个宣言中得到发展的马克思列宁主义原理是极其正确和具有伟大的生命力的”。
    社论说，当共产党和工人党举行莫斯科会议时，帝国主义反动势力曾经大喊大叫说，国际共产主义运动正经历着危机，正走向衰落和瓦解。反动势力希望那些在某些兄弟党内抬头的修正主义分子能够击破共产主义力量，并且竭力支持这些分子的分裂活动。但是，帝国主义反动势力的希望彻底地破灭了。一年来，国际共产主义运动不但没有衰退和瓦解，相反，出现了新的思想高涨。
    社论最后说，莫斯科会议大大地推动了反对资本主义和建设社会主义及共产主义的斗争。这个斗争和建设今后都要日益加强。俄国十月革命的胜利所打开的世界从资本主义社会向社会主义过渡的进程，正在势不可挡地发展和前进着。“任何力量都阻挡不住这个伟大的历史进程的胜利发展”。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”社论
    社会主义阵营日益占优势
    匈牙利“人民自由报”14日以“给世界以和平”为题发表社论，纪念社会主义国家共产党和工人党宣言及六十四个共产党和工人党的“和平宣言”发表一周年。
    社论指出，这两个宣言是当代共产主义运动最重要的文献，是建设社会主义和争取和平斗争的全面纲领，同时也是共产主义和民族解放运动以及各国人民和平斗争高涨道路上的里程碑。
    社论说，一年来的实践证明两个文件对国际形势论断的正确。一年来，我们可以看到，社会主义与和平力量是如何不断向前挺进，帝国主义是如何连续地丧失其阵地，帝国主义国家要想阻挠殖民体系的继续崩溃，已是无能为力了。
    社论说，社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言曾指出：“在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义”，一年来的事实证明这个论断是正确的。各国共产党和工人党一致反对最完整地反映在南共纲领中的现代修正主义，这就是国际共产主义运动团结的证明。
    社论最后说，社会主义阵营对于腐朽的帝国主义阵营正日益取得新的优势，这是我们时代最重要的内容，这是历史发展的不能转移的方向。社会主义在全世界取得最后胜利是一种必然规律。
    “新德意志报”社论
    人民比帝国主义强大
    “新德意志报”14日以“重要的一周年”为题发表社论，纪念莫斯科宣言发表一周年。社论说，一年前在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议是第二次世界大战结束以来国际工人运动史上最重要的事件之一。这次会议通过的“和平宣言”的崇高思想已经变成一股实际的力量，这些思想鼓舞了许多国家里的人民群众。
    社论指出，今年夏天，人民的运动阻止了帝国主义对伊拉克的侵略，迫使美英侵略者撤出了黎巴嫩和约旦。这些新的证据也可以证明：“今天，人民比帝国主义强大，战争是可以避免的”。
    社论指出，工人阶级运动的敌人对于抬出同莫斯科宣言相对的纲领的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导人大加喝采。社论说，这个彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领的目的显然是想分裂工人阶级运动，并且在社会主义阵营内部制造分裂。但是，“没有一个共产党和工人党跟着南斯拉夫修正主义者走，所有的党都驳斥和谴责了贝尔格莱德和它们自己队伍里的修正主义观点”。
    蒙古“真理报”社论
    我们的队伍一天天扩大
    蒙古“真理报”14日以“马克思列宁主义的旗帜在高高飘扬”为题发表社论，纪念各国共产党、工人党代表莫斯科会议和会议的两个宣言发表的一周年。社论说，莫斯科会议发表的两个宣言对世界共产主义运动的理论与实践的发展具有不可磨灭的重大意义。过去一年证明了这两个宣言所作出的论断和方针“是完全正确而又英明的”。
    社论说，各国共产党和工人党在反对现代修正主义的斗争中更加紧密地团结起来了。它们一致批判南共纲领，为保护马列主义的纯洁性进行了顽强的斗争，揭露了南共纲领的彻头彻尾的修正主义内容和南共领导人背叛工人阶级利益的行为。
    社论最后说：随着社会主义阵营的日益巩固，各国人民都更加认识到了这个阵营的优越性。社论说：“我们在各国的朋友和伙伴的队伍一天比一天扩大了，共产主义的旗帜在地球上空更高高地飘扬着，它的鲜艳的红色成了人类幸福的新时期的曙光而发出了万丈光芒”。
    捷“红色权利报”社论
    共产主义理想一定胜利
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”15日以“共产主义的胜利旗帜”为题发表社论，纪念莫斯科宣言发表一周年。
    社论说，在过去一年中所获得的经验，绝对证实了在莫斯科会谈中作出的马克思主义分析的正确性。
    社论说：莫斯科宣言已经成了整个国际共产主义运动的纲领性文件。在这个文件的基础上，在绝对忠实于马克思列宁主义的基础上，各国共产党和工人党的团结在过去的时期中得到了巩固。所有的共产党和工人党都绝对一致地站出来反对现代修正主义，这种修正主义仍然是当今主要的危险。这种观点的一致在对于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领的坚决否定和公开的有原则的批判中特别明显地得到了证明，现代修正主义最清楚地最全面地表现在这个纲领中。没有一个共产党对这些反马克思主义、反列宁主义的观点表示同意。
    社论最后指出：争取社会主义和和平的斗争的实践证明了一年前在莫斯科会议上通过的意义巨大的纲领性文件是完全正确的。各共产党和工人党在过去一年中所取得的成就，在建设和加强新的社会主义制度方面的新成就，使全世界普通人民充满信心，相信社会主义和共产主义的崇高理想一定会胜利。
