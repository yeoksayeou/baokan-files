Do Not Deny Remuneration According to Labor
Peng Hai

"Remuneration according to labor" is the principle of distribution in the initial stage of communism. This is an inevitable process and also an objective and inevitable law in the socialist economic life. Because in the early stages of socialist construction, and even throughout the process of socialist construction, it is impossible to immediately achieve "to each according to his needs," so it is inevitable to adopt "remuneration according to labor," and there is no other way. Unless absolute egalitarianism is implemented, but absolute egalitarianism, whether in socialist society or communist society, is detrimental to society and cannot be absolutely equal. The current wage system is a specific measure and method for implementing the principle of remuneration according to labor. The details of this or that specific measure and method are not inevitable, but remuneration according to labor has its historical inevitability.

The current wage system basically embodies the principle of "remuneration according to labor," but it still has many imperfections and inadequacies. That is, between mental and physical labor, complex and simple labor, industrial and agricultural labor, in the distribution of the fruits of labor, it still inherits the old habits and traditions of the bourgeoisie, and still shows the remnants of bourgeois right. Its specific manifestation is that there are many grades and large grade differences, mental labor is treated more favorably than physical labor, and industrial labor is treated more favorably than agricultural labor.

Is it because the current wage system has defects that it can be considered that "remuneration according to labor" is unreasonable? I think it is impossible to equate remuneration according to labor with the wage system. The improper implementation of the wage system does not deny the inevitability of the principle of "remuneration according to labor" in socialist society. This is a matter of studying and reforming the wage system, and it is not possible to immediately realize "to each according to his needs" or have "absolute egalitarianism." The problem lies in correctly treating "remuneration according to labor" and how to move towards a more perfect distribution principle.

We should not criticize "more work, more gain; less work, less gain" in a general way, but should criticize the unnecessary large differences in the distribution of the fruits of labor between industrial and agricultural labor, mental and physical labor, complex and simple labor, and criticize the remnants of bourgeois right thinking inherited when calculating the amount of labor, that is, the anti-Marxist-Leninist viewpoints of valuing mental labor and despising physical labor, valuing complex labor and despising simple labor, and those erroneous ideas that violate the Party's labor viewpoint and mass viewpoint in the distribution issue.

In the same kind of physical labor and the same kind of mental labor, it is of promotional significance to society and individuals to implement appropriate, but not expanded, spiritual rewards, and even material rewards, for those who work more and work better. Whether this situation will exist in future communist society is difficult to imagine now; however, it can be said that commending the advanced and promoting the backward will always be applicable in the future (of course, the factor of material interest stimulation will be greatly reduced in the future). The labor attitude of "doing it or not, it's all the same" is something we must always criticize.

If we say that our criticism of the remnants of bourgeois right is to negate "remuneration according to labor," or even to engage in absolute egalitarianism, this is an insufficient understanding of the significance of criticizing the remnants of bourgeois right. This idea is not in line with our current interests of accelerating socialist construction and preparing for the transition to communism.

In today's situation where it is not yet possible to achieve to each according to his needs, it is impossible to abandon remuneration according to labor; implementing absolute egalitarianism is also just a fantasy. Egalitarianism is impossible at present, and it will also be impossible in future communist society. The differences in people's division of labor will not be eliminated at present, nor will they be completely eliminated in the future. The differences in material needs and hobbies that come with the division of labor cannot be eliminated either. Even in terms of people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, it is impossible to be uniform and have one taste in future communist society. Absolute egalitarianism runs counter to communism.

It should be admitted that at present, in the ideological struggle to criticize the remnants of bourgeois right, some people have forgotten that the differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and physical labor are the realities left to us by thousands of years of historical development, and also social phenomena that the bourgeoisie and people with bourgeois viewpoints are trying their best to maintain in the long term. Only the great Party has put forward the task of criticizing the remnants of bourgeois right, calling on us to thoroughly break with bourgeois ideology on the issue of distribution, which is also a fundamental issue in the cause of socialist and communist construction, and to promote the great struggle of socialism and communism in our country. Some people, starting from absolute egalitarianism, hope to eliminate all differences in people's material life in a few days. This absolute egalitarianism and the impatient attitude towards historical development will also run into obstacles even in communist society. In this absolute egalitarianism, there are hidden individualistic thoughts and demands.

Remuneration according to labor and to each according to his needs are both communist distribution methods. The former is the principle of distribution realized in the initial stage of communism, and the latter is the principle of distribution realized in the advanced stage of communism. This difference is determined by the social productivity of the two stages of communist society. Due to the difference in social productivity between the initial stage of communism and after its completion, there cannot be no difference in distribution. The difference between these two distribution methods is determined by its objective reality and is independent of people's will.

Of course, "remuneration according to labor" is an inevitable process, but it cannot become an eternal inevitability. With the development of social productive forces, the improvement of social productivity, and the gradual disappearance of the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, between mental and physical labor, and between complex and simple labor, the principle of "remuneration according to labor" will also gradually withdraw from the stage of history and transition from remuneration according to labor to to each according to his needs.

The current criticism of the "remuneration according to labor" distribution principle is precisely showing that after the great leap in production and the great liberation of thought, in the process of gradually eradicating the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor, the people of our country are re-evaluating the distribution principle of the initial stage of communism and paving the way for the realization of the higher distribution principle of to each according to his needs.

However, the criticism of bourgeois right is one thing, and the criticism of remuneration according to labor is another. The remnants of bourgeois right refer to the fact that we currently inherit bourgeois right thinking to some extent when calculating the quality and quantity of labor, which is not conducive to the gradual elimination of the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously criticize this remnant of bourgeois right so that we can reduce some unnecessary differences in distribution, thereby overcoming the internal contradictions of the people caused by the influence of the remnants of bourgeois right.

Therefore, the criticism of the remnants of bourgeois right can enable us to use the method of remuneration according to labor to transition to the communist "to each according to his needs" before realizing to each according to his needs, and get rid of the various decadent prejudices of the bourgeoisie and capitalist society regarding the differences between mental and physical labor, and between complex and simple labor, so that we can more appropriately use the understanding of the objective laws of "remuneration according to labor" and appropriately use the method of "remuneration according to labor" to transition to a society of "to each according to his needs."

The criticism of remuneration according to labor is to maintain a clear head about the distribution method in the initial stage of communism, fully recognize the difference between this distribution principle and our highest ideal, and correctly recognize that due to the historical inevitability of the "remuneration according to labor" distribution principle, labor grade differences will inevitably arise in the practice of this principle. On the one hand, affirm the necessity and inevitability of this grade that marks the quality and quantity of socialist labor, and on the other hand, strive to eliminate the grade differences in this remuneration according to labor and gradually eliminate the differences between workers and peasants, between mental and physical labor, and between complex and simple labor.

### 不要否定按劳取酬

    不要否定按劳取酬
    彭海
    “按劳取酬”是共产主义的初级阶段的分配原则，这是一个必然过程，也是社会主义社会经济生活中一个客观的必然的规律。因为在社会主义建设初期，以至社会主义建设过程中，还不可能立即做到“各取所需”，就必然要采取“按劳取酬”，舍此别无他途。除非来个绝对平均，然而绝对平均不论在社会主义社会，或者共产主义社会，都是对社会不利，而且也无法绝对平均的。目前的工资制是一种实行按劳取酬原则的具体措施和办法。这种和那种具体的措施和办法的细节，没有必然性，而按劳取酬却是有它历史的必然性的。
    目前我们的工资制基本上体现了“按劳取酬”的原则，但它还有许多不周密不妥善的地方。这就是对于脑力劳动和体力劳动之间，复杂劳动和简单劳动之间，工业劳动和农业劳动之间在分配劳动果实上，还因袭了资产阶级的旧习惯、旧传统，还表现着资产阶级法权残余。它的具体表现就是级数多、级数大，脑力劳动待遇厚于体力劳动，工业劳动的待遇厚于农业劳动。
    是不是因为目前的工资制有缺陷，就可以认为“按劳取酬”不合理呢？我认为不能在按劳取酬和工资制之间划等号。工资制执行得不妥善，并不能否认社会主义社会下“按劳取酬”原则的必然性。这是要对工资制加以研究和变革的问题，而不是马上就可以实现“各取所需”或者来个“绝对平均”。问题在于正确地对待“按劳取酬”，以及如何向完善的分配原则前进。
    我们不能笼统地批判“多劳多得，少劳少得”，而应该批判对于在工业劳动与农业劳动、脑力劳动与体力劳动、复杂劳动与简单劳动之间劳动果实分配上不必要的太大的差别，批判那种在计算劳动量时因袭来的资产阶级法权残余思想，也就是重视脑力劳动轻视体力劳动，重视复杂劳动轻视简单劳动的反马列主义观点，那些在分配问题上违反党的劳动观点和群众观点的错误思想。
    在同一种体力劳动和同一种脑力劳动中，对于劳动得多劳动得好的，实行适当的，而非扩大化的精神奖励，以至物质奖励，对于社会对于个人都有它促进的意义。这种情况在今后的共产主义社会中是否存在，现在还很难设想；然而，可以说，表扬先进推动落后就在今后也是永远适用的（当然物质利益刺激的因素今后会大大缩小）。“干不干，二斤半”的劳动态度始终是我们要加以批判的。
    如果说我们批判资产阶级法权残余，就是要否定掉“按劳取酬”，甚至是要搞绝对平均主义，这是对于批判资产阶级法权残余的意义的理解不足。这种想法是不符合我们当前加速建设社会主义和准备向共产主义过渡的利益的。
    在今天还没有可能达到各取所需的情况下，丢掉按劳取酬，是不可能的；实行绝对平均主义，也只是一种幻想。平均主义在目前不可能，在今后共产主义社会中也是不可能实现的。人们分工的差别在目前不会消除，今后也不会完全消除。随着分工而来的物质需要和兴趣爱好的差别，也不可能消除。即使在人们的衣食住行方面，在今后共产主义社会里，也不可能是千篇一律，一个口味，绝对平均主义和共产主义是背道而驰的。
    应该承认，目前有人在批判资产阶级法权残余的思想斗争中，忘掉了城乡之间工农之间脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别，是几千年历史发展遗留给我们的现实，也是资产阶级和具有资产阶级观点的人竭力企图长远保持下去的社会现象。只有伟大的党提出了批判资产阶级法权残余的任务，号召我们在分配问题上，从而也是在社会主义和共产主义建设事业中一个带有根本性的问题上，彻底和资产阶级思想决裂，促进我国社会主义和共产主义的伟大斗争。有些人从绝对平均主义出发，希望在几天之内就一下子消除人们在物质生活上的一切差别，这种绝对平均主义和对于历史发展的急躁的态度，即使在共产主义社会里也会碰壁。在这种绝对平均主义的思想里，是潜藏着个人主义的思想和要求的。
    按劳取酬和各取所需都是共产主义的分配方法，前者是共产主义初级阶段实现的分配原则，后者是共产主义高级阶段实现的分配原则。这样的区别，是由于共产主义社会两个阶段的社会生产率所决定的。由于共产主义初期和建成之后社会生产率的差别，在分配上也不能不存在着差别。这两种分配方法的不同，是由它的客观实际情况决定了的，是不依人们意志为转移的。
    当然，“按劳取酬”是一个必然的过程，但并不能成为永远的必然。随着社会生产力的发展，社会生产率的提高，工农之间、城乡之间、脑力劳动与体力劳动之间、复杂劳动和简单劳动之间的差别逐步消失，“按劳取酬”的原则也将逐步地退出历史舞台，由按劳取酬向各取所需过渡。
    目前对于“按劳取酬”分配原则的批判，正表明着我国人民在生产大跃进思想大解放以后，在逐步消灭工农之间、城乡之间、脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别而奋斗的过程中，对于共产主义初级阶段的分配原则的重新估价，和为实现更高的各取所需的分配原则开辟道路。
    但是，对于资产阶级法权的批判是一回事，对于按劳取酬的批判又是一回事。资产阶级法权残余，是指我们目前在计算劳动的质量和数量时，某种程度上因袭了资产阶级的法权思想，因而不利于工农之间城乡之间脑力劳动与体力劳动之间差别的逐步消除。因此，有必要大张旗鼓地批判这种资产阶级法权残余，使我们能够在分配中缩小一些不必要的差别，从而克服由于资产阶级法权残余影响而产生的人民内部的矛盾。
    因此，对于资产阶级法权残余的批判，可以使我们在实现各取所需以前，运用按劳取酬的方式，向共产主义的“各取所需”过渡中，摆脱资产阶级以及资本主义社会中对于脑力劳动与体力劳动，复杂劳动与简单劳动之间差别的种种腐朽偏见，使我们更适当地运用对于“按劳取酬”客观规律的认识，适当运用“按劳取酬”的方法，向“各取所需”的社会过渡。
    对于按劳取酬的批判，则是对于共产主义初级阶段的分配方式保持清醒的头脑，充分认识这种分配原则和我们最高理想的区别；正确认识由于“按劳取酬”分配原则的历史必然性，因而不能不在这一原则实践过程中产生着劳动的等级差别。一方面肯定这种标志社会主义劳动的质量和数量的等级的必要和必然，另一方面为消除这种按劳取酬中的等级差别，而逐步消除工农之间、脑力劳动与体力劳动之间、复杂劳动与简单劳动之间的差别而斗争。
