Here is the forefront. But the crops grow best; standing on the mountaintop and looking forward, the green rice paddies roll up waves with the sea breeze. Densely planted sweet potato green leaves are everywhere; in the vegetable garden, radishes grow lush leaves. The autumn fields are plowed neatly, waiting for sowing. The team members are producing in the fields; if it weren't for the sparsely sounding artillery fire, who would believe that this is the forefront in front of this beautiful picture?

When the artillery war started, many shells fell in the village, and all the old people and children in the village were evacuated to the rear. Youth Captain Lin Anzhen led some team members who remained in the village and entered the stone caves on the mountain. They took the cave as their home and persisted in production and supporting the front. The cultivated land is on the seashore at the forefront. They also dug some "safe caves" on the edge of the fields, and still planted crops in the fields in the midst of the war.

One early morning, the production team members were rushing to plant late sweet potatoes when the enemy fired artillery at the village. More than forty shells exploded near the village; the team members immediately drilled into the "safe caves." This morning, the enemy fired artillery at this area four times, and the team members engaged in a "race against time" with the enemy. When the enemy fired artillery, they read newspapers and studied culture in the air-raid shelter; when the artillery fire stopped, they came out and worked hard. Under the enemy's constant harassment, they completed three days' work in two days; and planted the sweet potatoes in time.

At the forefront, crops are often damaged by the enemy's artillery fire; when they are damaged, they immediately fill the bomb craters and replant. There was a sweet potato field in the team that was hit by shells five times, and they replanted it time and time again. In those days, the forefront had been dry for a long time without rain, and the drought was expanding; the team members went down the mountain in the dark at night to fetch water from the well to irrigate the fields. More than twenty acres of rice fields are filled with water. The more difficult the work, the more vigorous the spirit of the team members.

Every day after dinner, they used farm tools as bells, knocking them clangingly, and shouted loudly: "Let's go, let's go down the mountain to work!" Lin Chunmu and his sister contracted a paddy field, and they kept watering it every day. One morning, while they were watering, the enemy suddenly fired artillery. They listened for a while and said: "It doesn't matter, they are firing far away, let's just do what we do."

    炮火下面种庄稼
    清峰
    这里是最前沿。但庄稼长得最好；站在山顶向前遥望，绿油油的稻禾随着海风卷起波浪。密植的地瓜绿叶遍地；菜园里萝卜长出片片嫩叶。秋闲地犁得整整齐齐，等待播种。队员们在田野上生产；如果没有稀稀落落地响着的炮声，在这幅美丽的图画前面，谁会相信这就是前沿呢？
    炮战开始，村子里落了许多炮弹，全村的老人、儿童都疏散到后方去了。青年队长林安镇带领留在村子里的部分队员，进入山上的石洞。他们以洞为家，坚持生产和支前。耕种的土地就在最前沿的海边上。他们又在地头上挖了一些“安全洞”，战火中，照样在田野上种庄稼。
    一天清早，生产队员们正在抢种晚地瓜，敌人向这个村子打炮了。四十多发炮弹在村子附近爆炸；队员们立刻钻进“安全洞”。这个上午，敌人向这一带打了四次炮，队员们和敌人来个
  “分秒必争”。敌人打炮，他们在防炮洞读报，学文化；炮声停歇了，他们就出来猛干。在敌人不断骚扰的情况下，他们以两天的时间做完了三天的工作；及时地把地瓜种下去了。
  在前沿，庄稼经常被敌人打坏；打坏了，他们马上填平弹坑再补种。队里有一丘地瓜田，前后落了五次炮弹，他们一次次地把它补种起来。那几天，前沿久旱无雨，旱象扩大；队员们晚上摸黑下山，去水井边吊水灌田。二十多亩水稻，丘丘田水荡漾。工作越艰苦，队员们精神越旺盛。
    他们每天吃过饭，把农具当做钟，敲得叮当直响，大声叫喊：“走啊，下山干活去！”林春木和他的姐姐包了一丘水田，每天保持浇水，一天早上正在浇水，敌人突然打炮了，他们听了一下，说：“没关系，打得很远，我们还是干我们的。”
