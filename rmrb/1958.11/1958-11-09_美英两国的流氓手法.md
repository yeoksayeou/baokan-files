The Rogue Tactics of the United States and Britain
Commentator of this newspaper

On November 7, U.S. President Eisenhower, using the excuse that the Soviet Union had conducted two nuclear tests after October 31, announced that the United States was released from “any obligation” to cease nuclear weapon testing for one year from October 31, and threatened: "If the Soviet Union does not immediately make a corresponding announcement to abandon testing, the United States will have to reconsider its attitude," meaning that the United States will immediately resume testing. On the same day, the British Foreign Office also issued the same statement like an echo.

Nothing is more unreasonable and hypocritical than this kind of statement from the United States and Britain!

When the Soviet Union unilaterally ceased nuclear weapon testing from March to September this year in order to open a practical beginning for the universal cessation of nuclear weapon testing, the United States and Britain unscrupulously conducted a large-scale series of tests during this period. The Soviet Union, of course, could not tolerate this conspiracy by the United States and Britain to take advantage of the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions and attempt to seize unilateral military advantages. Therefore, the Soviet Union resumed testing in September and announced that it would continue to conduct experimental explosions until the number of explosions was equal to that conducted by the United States and Britain since March 31. It was necessary for the Soviet Union to take this resolute measure to safeguard the security of the Soviet Union and the security of the people of all countries. Despite this, the Soviet Union still strived to have the United States and Britain jointly satisfy the wish of the people of the world to stop nuclear weapon testing forever, and issued a statement on October 30 stating that if the United States and Britain were prepared to conclude an agreement to stop testing forever, then even if the Soviet Union conducted fewer experimental explosions than the United States and Britain, the Soviet Union would be willing to stop testing immediately. The Soviet Union's attitude is open, aboveboard, reasonable, and justified. However, what attitude did the governments of the United States and Britain take? While the Soviet Union stopped testing, they frantically conducted tests and refused to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union to stop testing. After their own nuclear weapon tests came to an end, they insisted on the absurd "one-year suspension of testing" plan and refused to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union to stop testing forever. This is utter rogue behavior in international affairs.

The United States and Britain proposed to stop testing for exactly one year after October 31 because they needed about a year to prepare for the next test. However, they claimed that they had stopped testing after October 31, while the Soviet Union had not stopped, attempting to shift the responsibility to the Soviet Union in order to deceive the people of the world and conceal their sinister faces unwilling to stop nuclear weapon testing. Isn't this utter hypocrisy?

The United States and Britain agreed to hold negotiations on the issue of stopping nuclear weapon testing on the one hand, and insisted on the fundamentally unworkable "one-year suspension of testing" plan on the other hand, which was deliberately intended to make it impossible for negotiations to reach an agreement. Not only that, at the same time as the Geneva negotiations began, on November 1, the United States and Britain manipulated the voting machine to force the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to adopt the "Seventeen-Nation Proposal" that refused to stop nuclear weapon testing forever, attempting to use the United Nations to exert pressure on the Soviet Union and undermine the negotiations. The sinister intention of the United States and Britain to not want to stop nuclear weapon testing at all, but to shift the responsibility to the Soviet Union, is exposed even more clearly.

However, all the conspiracies and tricks of the United States and Britain cannot deceive people. Their threat to resume testing is equally unable to intimidate people. People see very clearly that it is completely justified for the Soviet Union to continue testing until the United States and Britain agree to conclude an agreement to permanently stop nuclear weapon testing. Even Dulles cannot but admit that the Soviet Union "has no obligation" to stop testing after October 31. In judging who is violating the wish of the people of the world to stop nuclear weapon testing, people have only one standard, that is: who has consistently advocated the universal, permanent, and unconditional cessation of nuclear weapon testing? Who stubbornly refuses to permanently stop nuclear weapon testing?

If the United States and Britain are truly concerned about the issue of stopping nuclear weapon testing, they should seriously negotiate in order to conclude an agreement to stop testing forever. Playing any tricks and using any threats will only arouse greater indignation among the people.

    美英两国的流氓手法
    本报评论员
    11月7日，美国总统艾森豪威尔借口苏联在10月31日以后进行了两次核试验，而宣布美国解除了所承担的从10月31日起停止核武器试验一年的“任何义务”，并且威胁道：“如果苏联不马上相应地宣布放弃试验，美国就不得不重新考虑它的态度”，意思就是说美国要马上恢复试验。同一天，英国外交部也像应声虫似地发表了同样的声明。
    再也没有什么比美英两国这种声明更无理、更伪善的了！
    当苏联为了给普遍停止核武器试验打开一个实际的开端，而在今年3月到9月单方面停止核武器试验的时候，美英两国却在这段时期肆无忌惮地进行了大规模的一系列试验。美英这种利用苏联的和平愿望而企图乘隙夺取单方面的军事优势的阴谋，苏联当然不能容忍。因此，苏联于9月恢复试验，并且宣布要继续进行试验性爆炸，直到和3月31日以来美英两国所进行的爆炸数目相等为止。苏联采取这种坚决措施，是为了保障苏联的安全、也是为了保障各国人民的安全所必须的。虽然如此，苏联还是极力争取美英两国共同满足世界人民的要求永远停止核武器试验的愿望，而于10月30日发表声明说：只要美英两国准备缔结永远停止试验的协定，那么，即使苏联比美英两国进行的试验性爆炸要少，苏联也愿意立即停止试验。苏联的态度是光明磊落的，合情合理的。然而，美英两国政府采取了什么态度呢？它们在苏联停止试验期间，疯狂地进行试验，不肯同苏联订立停止试验的协议。它们在自己的核武器试验告一段落后，就坚持“暂停试验一年”的荒谬方案，而拒绝同苏联缔结永远停止试验的协定。这是在国际事务上十足的流氓手法。
    美英两国提出在10月31日以后不多不少地停止试验一年，就是因为它们需要大约一年的时间为下一次的试验作准备。但是，它们却表示自己在10月31日以后已经停止试验，而苏联并没有停止，想把责任推到苏联身上，以蒙蔽世界人民的眼睛，掩盖自己不愿停止核武器试验的凶恶面孔，这不是十足的伪善吗？
    美英两国一方面同意进行关于停止核武器试验问题的谈判，一方面又坚持根本行不通的“暂停试验一年”的方案，这就是蓄意要使谈判不可能达成协议。不仅如此，在日内瓦谈判开始的同时，美英于11月1日操纵表决机器强使联合国大会政治委员会通过了拒绝永远停止核武器试验的“十七国提案”，企图利用联合国来对苏联施加压力，破坏谈判。美英两国根本不想停止核武器试验，而又要把责任推到苏联身上的恶毒用心，就暴露得更加清楚了。
    但是，美英的一切阴谋诡计都是骗不了人的。它们要恢复试验的威胁也同样吓不倒人。人们看得很清楚，苏联在美英同意缔结永久停止核武器试验的协定以前继续进行试验，是完全正当的，连杜勒斯都不能不承认苏联“没有任何义务”在10月31日以后停止试验。在判断是谁违背世界人民要求停止核武器试验的愿望时，人们只有一个标准，那就是：谁一贯主张普遍地永久地、无条件地停止核武器试验？谁顽固地拒绝永久地停止核武器试验？
    美英两国如果是真正地关怀停止核武器试验的问题，就应该认真协商，以便缔结一项永远停止试验的协定。玩弄任何手法，使用任何威胁，都只能激起人们的更大愤慨。
