Xinhua News Agency, November 27th Dispatch from Moscow: The Soviet government today sent a note to the United States government, proposing "to turn West Berlin into an independent political entity—a demilitarized free city."

    The Soviet government believes that the Potsdam Agreement of the Allies on the German question has lost its effect due to the subsequent destruction by Western countries.

    The note emphasizes that this proposed demilitarized free city would have its own government and could manage its own economy, administration, and other affairs. The four powers that jointly participated in the administration of Berlin after World War II, as well as the two German states—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—could undertake the obligation to respect the status of West Berlin as a free city.

    The note announces that the Soviet government does not object to the United Nations participating in the observance of the status of West Berlin as a free city.

    The Soviet government also delivered notes with the same content to the governments of Great Britain and France, respectively.

    In its note to the Western countries, the Soviet Union pointed out that if the governments of the United States, Britain, and France agree to abolish the current occupation regime in West Berlin and establish a free city on the territory of West Berlin, the Soviet government is prepared to conduct formal contact with the government of the German Democratic Republic in the name of the four countries, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, on this issue. The Soviet government has already conducted preliminary informal consultations with the government of the German Democratic Republic.

    The Soviet government emphasized that if the Western three countries do not accept this proposal, then it is meaningless for the former occupying powers to negotiate on the Berlin issue.

    The Soviet government suggested that the existing system of military transport from West Berlin to West Germany by the United States, Britain, and France could remain unchanged for six months. The note pointed out that if the countries concerned do not use the above-mentioned period to reach a corresponding agreement on the status of Berlin, the Soviet government will implement the established measures by reaching an agreement with the German Democratic Republic. That is to say, the German Democratic Republic will fully exercise sovereignty over its territory, territorial waters, and airspace. At the same time, the representatives of the Soviet troops stationed in Germany and other officials will also stop all contacts with the military representatives and other officials of the United States, Britain, and France related to the Berlin issue, which have been maintained until now.

    The note continued: "In solving a problem like Berlin, taking intimidating measures and unwise threats of force is the most inappropriate. Only madmen would launch a new world war to maintain the privileges of the occupiers in West Berlin."

    The note said that neither the Soviet Union nor any other socialist country resolutely defends its rights, defends its borders, and acts according to the motto of "one for all, all for one." The note emphasized: "Any action that violates the borders of the German Democratic Republic, Poland, or Czechoslovakia, any act of aggression against any participant of the Warsaw Treaty, will be regarded by all participants of the treaty as an act of aggression against all of them and will immediately cause a corresponding counterattack."

    The note pointed out that the Soviet government's adoption of such a position on the issue of the Berlin occupation regime is only intended to end the abnormal and dangerous situation in Berlin caused by the continued occupation of West Berlin by the United States, Britain, and France, so that West Berlin is no longer a springboard for intensified espionage, sabotage, and other subversive activities against socialist countries, against the German Democratic Republic, and against the Soviet Union. The note said: "The Soviet government's decision to implement measures aimed at abolishing the Berlin occupation regime is to normalize the situation in Berlin in favor of European peace, in favor of Germany's peace, independence, and development."

    A copy of this note was also distributed to the governments of all countries that have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, as well as the governments of other member states of the United Nations.

    On the same day, the Soviet government also sent a note to the government of the German Democratic Republic, suggesting that negotiations be held between delegations of the two governments in order to study in detail the issue of measures aimed at eliminating the state of occupation in Berlin. In addition, the Soviet government also sent the note on the Berlin issue to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

### 苏联照会美英法政府提出建议  把西柏林变成非军事的自由城市

    苏联照会美英法政府提出建议
    把西柏林变成非军事的自由城市
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府今天照会美国政府，建议“把西柏林变成一个独立的政治单位——非军事的自由城市”。
    苏联政府认为，盟国关于德国问题的波茨坦协定，由于后来遭到西方国家的破坏，已经失去了效力。
    照会强调指出，这个建议中的非军事的自由城市，将可以有自己的政府，可以自己管理自己的经济、行政和其他事务。第二次世界大战后共同参加管理柏林的四大国以及两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国可以承担义务：尊重西柏林作为自由城市的地位。
    照会宣布，苏联政府不反对联合国参与遵守西柏林这个自由城市的地位。
    苏联政府还把同样内容的照会分别交给英、法两国政府。
    苏联在给西方国家的照会中指出，如果美、英、法三国政府同意取消目前西柏林的占领制度并在西柏林的领土上建立自由城市，苏联政府就准备以美、英、法、苏四国的名义就这个问题同民主德国政府进行正式的接触。苏联政府同民主德国政府已经进行过初步的非正式的磋商。
    苏联政府强调指出，如果西方三国不接受这个建议，那末，过去的占领国就柏林问题进行谈判就毫无意义了。
    苏联政府建议，美、英、法三国从西柏林往西德进行军事运输的现行制度，可以在半年内维持不变。照会指出，如果有关国家不利用上述期限就柏林地位问题达成相应的协议，苏联政府就将通过同民主德国达成协议的办法来实现既定的措施。这就是说，德意志民主共和国将完全对本国领土、领水和领空行使主权。同时，苏联驻德国的军队代表和其他官方人士也将停止到现在一直同美、英、法三国有关的军队代表和其他官方人士就柏林问题进行的一切接触。
    照会接着说：“在解决柏林这样的问题时，采取恫吓手段和不明智的武力威胁是最不适宜了。只有疯子才会为了维持占领者在西柏林的特权而发动新的世界大战”。
    照会说，无论是苏联，无论是任何其他社会主义国家都坚决维护自己的权利，保卫自己的国境，按照一人为大家、大家为一人这句格言行事。照会强调说：“任何破坏德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克国境的行动，对华沙条约任何一个参加国所采取的任何侵略行动，都将被这个条约的所有参加国看作是侵犯它们全体的行动，并将立即引起相应的回击。”
    照会指出，苏联政府在关于柏林占领制度问题上采取这样的立场，只是想结束由于美、英、法三国继续占领柏林西部而在柏林造成的那种不正常的和危险的局面，使西柏林不再是对社会主义国家、对民主德国和苏联加紧进行间谍破坏活动和其他颠复活动的跳板。照会说：“苏联政府决定实行一些旨在取消柏林占领制度的措施，这是为了使柏林的局势正常化，以有利于欧洲和平，以有利于德国的和平、独立和发展。”
    这项照会的附本还分发给所有同苏联有外交关系的国家的政府，以及联合国的其他成员国的政府。
    在同一天，苏联政府还给德意志民主共和国政府一项照会，建议在两国政府代表团之间举行谈判，以便详细研究旨在消除柏林占领状态的措施的问题。此外，苏联政府还把关于柏林问题的照会送交德意志联邦共和国政府。
