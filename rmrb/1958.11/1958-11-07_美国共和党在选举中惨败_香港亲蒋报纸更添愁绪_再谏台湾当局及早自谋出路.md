Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th - Hong Kong's "Cheng Bao" editorial today said that Eisenhower's remarks yesterday made people more suspicious that the United States was moving towards recognizing "two Chinas." It "will cause another round of doubts in Taipei about the United States." The editorial said, "If Ike really has the idea of ​​recognizing 'two Chinas,' then he will be very wrong," because "what the Kuomintang and the Communist Party agree on at the moment is to oppose the conspiracy of 'two Chinas.' Any country or person who makes this ambition will be strongly criticized by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party."

The pro-Chiang "Sing Tao Daily" published an editorial today entitled "Sino (Chiang)-U.S. Relations Have Not Escaped a Dangerous Period," saying that U.S. President Eisenhower's remarks at a press conference after the U.S. congressional elections yesterday were very dangerous for the Taiwan authorities. It said that Eisenhower's remarks on whether the United States would adopt a "two Chinas" policy "appear tough at first glance, but are weak at heart." This pro-Chiang newspaper said that as long as China "releases all the imprisoned American nationals (referring to American criminals in China), the United States' policy toward the CCP will change and it will recognize the CCP. How dangerous this is for its ally, the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group)!" The editorial said that the "relationship between the United States and the Taiwan authorities has never escaped a dangerous period," and it is unknown how the Taiwan authorities "will handle the aftermath."

Hong Kong's pro-Chiang newspapers today also commented on the U.S.-Chiang relationship after the Republican Party's crushing defeat in the U.S. congressional elections. Many pro-Chiang newspapers believe that the United States, which is accustomed to "sacrificing allies," is becoming increasingly unreliable, and they demand that the Taiwan authorities control their own destiny.

Hong Kong's "Tian Wen Tai" bi-daily published a commentary titled "The U.S. Midterm Elections Will Not Change its China Policy, China's (referring to the Chiang group) Own Destiny is Determined by Itself," saying that the U.S. policy toward China has been "fixed" since it sent the Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait in June 1950. "That is, the United States wants to establish a military base in Taiwan and Penghu on the Western Pacific defense line, freezing Taiwan." This newspaper said, "Compared with today's and future struggles, if the United States does not change its course, its continued failure is beyond doubt. If the United States as the free world is like this, what else can be hoped for!" This pro-Chiang newspaper said, therefore, the Taiwan authorities' "idea of ​​relying on foreign aid in the past should be greatly denied. What the United States can assist us with has now reached its peak and will not exceed the current limit." It finally advised the Taiwan authorities, "In a nutshell, it is still: solve your own destiny by yourself."

The pro-Chiang "Nan Zhong Daily" today reminded the Taiwan authorities to pay attention to the conspiracy to step up the creation of "two Chinas" after the U.S. congressional elections. It said, "Since Dulles' visit to Taipei, the Eisenhower government's tendency to favor 'two Chinas' has gradually become obvious. The Democratic Party is enthusiastic about the 'two Chinas' line."

Hong Kong's "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" commented on the 4th, "warning" the Taiwan authorities "not to place too much hope on a certain party in the United States." It said: "Past one-way diplomacy with the United States has committed a great mistake."

This pro-Chiang evening paper commented on the 3rd that the current situation is that even Taiwan Kuomintang people and even the whole world are disgusted with the United States, and anti-American sentiment has reached the point where it is "either a friend or an enemy." It said, "We should not hesitate to say that this measure by the United States is tantamount to cultivating strong 'anti-American' roots in the hearts of the Chinese people." It said, "Taking the hearts of the people of Hong Kong as an example, in the past ten days, the sales of publications related to the United States have greatly declined. If you ask passers-by, they will not say good things about the United States. This reaction is very rapid. It is either a friend or an enemy. There is no need for communist propaganda to stir up trouble." This Kuomintang newspaper also said: "The biggest mistake of the U.S. authorities lies here: 'knowing only oneself and not others,' how can people be convinced? The so-called U.S. aid may have good intentions, but in this way, people regard it as 'ill-intentioned.' Not only towards China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group), the United States has also caused this widespread resentment in various countries and even in the American group. As a result, if the U.S. authorities still follow the past policies and attitudes, it can be asserted that they will run into obstacles everywhere."

### 美国共和党在选举中惨败  香港亲蒋报纸更添愁绪  再谏台湾当局及早自谋出路

    美国共和党在选举中惨败
    香港亲蒋报纸更添愁绪
    再谏台湾当局及早自谋出路
    新华社香港6日电　香港“成报”今天的社论中说，艾森豪威尔昨日的谈话更使人怀疑美国趋向承认“两个中国”。它“将会引起台北方面对美国另一番疑虑”。社论说，“假如艾克真有承认‘两个中国’的念头，那么，他将是非常错误的”。因为“国共两党现时一致的，就是反对‘两个中国’的阴谋。任何作此野心的国家或人物，都将为国共分别加以痛斥的”。
    亲蒋的“星岛日报”今天发表题为“中（蒋）美关系未脱危险时期”的社论说，美国总统艾森豪威尔在昨天美国国会改选后在记者招待会上所发表的谈话，对台湾当局是十分危险的。它说，艾森豪威尔对美国是否采取“两个中国”政策的谈话“骤视之是强硬的。但是，骨子里是软弱的”。这家亲蒋报纸说，只要中国“把所有的被囚美国侨民（指美国在华犯人）释放了，美国对中共政策，便会改变，便会承认中共了。这，对于盟友中华民国（指蒋介石集团），多么危险！”社论说，美国和台湾当局的“关系始终未脱离危险时期”，不知台湾当局“将何以善其后”？
    香港亲蒋报纸今天还纷纷评论美国国会选举共和党惨败后的美蒋关系。许多亲蒋报纸认为惯于“牺牲盟友”的美国愈来愈靠不住了，它们要求台湾当局自己掌握命运。
    香港“天文台”双日刊以“美中途选举不会变更对华政策，中国（指蒋集团）自己的命运由自己来决定”为标题发表述评说，美国的对华政策从1950年6月派出第七舰队开来台湾海峡以后，“是定型了的。即美国要在西太平洋防线上建立起以台澎为军事基地的原则下，冻结台湾”。这家报纸说，“在今日与今后斗争形势中比较，如果美国不改弦易辙，其继续失败是绝无可疑的。作为自由世界的美国如此，其它尚复何望！”这家亲蒋报纸说，因此，台湾当局“过去一直寄望于外力援助的想法，应该来一个大大的否定。美国所能援助于我们的，到现在已达到顶点，再不会超过现在所有的限度”。它最后劝告台湾当局说，“千言万语，一句话还是：自己的命运，由自己来解决”。
    亲蒋的“南中日报”今天提醒台湾当局注意美国国会选举后加紧制造“两个中国”的阴谋。它说，“自从杜勒斯访问台北之后，艾森豪威尔政府偏于‘两个中国’的倾向，逐渐明显。民主党正在热中于‘两个中国’路线”。
    香港“工商晚报”4日的评论“警告”台湾当局“不要对美国某一党寄予太多的祈望”。它说：“过去对美单线外交，已犯了极大错误。”
    这家亲蒋的晚报3日评论说，现在情势连台湾国民党人士甚至全世界都对美国反感，而且反美情绪已达到“不为友人，便为仇雠”的程度。它说，“我们应该毫不讳言，美国这一措施，不啻在中国人心上培植了强烈的‘反美’根苗”。它说，“以香港人心而论，这十天来，和美国有关的出版物销路大为褪减了，执途人而问之，都不会对美国讲好话的。这一反应十分敏捷，不为友人便为仇雠，这一点不必共党宣传从中挑拨的”。这家国民党报纸又说：“美国当局最大的错误就在这里：‘只知有己不知有人’，要人如何心服？所谓美援，也许言有好意成份，可是这么一来，人们视之，是‘不怀好意’的东西。何止对中国（指蒋介石集团），美国在各国甚至美洲集团内，也引起这种普遍的反感。结果美国当局仍然一本过去的政策和态度，则其到处碰钉，是可以断言的”。
