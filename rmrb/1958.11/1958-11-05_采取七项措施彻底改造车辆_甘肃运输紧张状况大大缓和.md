    Adopt Seven Measures to Thoroughly Transform Vehicles
    Gansu Greatly Alleviates Transportation Tension
    (Our report) Gansu Province has adopted seven measures in many regions to reform various vehicles, improve transportation efficiency, and greatly alleviate the labor shortage in these regions.
    According to the general situation in Gansu Province, transportation accounts for about one-third to one-half of the total labor force required for agricultural production; in steelmaking, about one-third of the labor force is also used on transportation lines. With so much labor required for transportation, improving transportation efficiency will relatively save a large amount of labor.
    The main measures for technical reform of transportation tools implemented in Gansu Province are: First, adding trailers to the rear of automobiles and animal-powered carts. Adding a trailer to a horse-drawn cart can carry an additional 1,000 jin each time, which is equivalent to increasing the physical labor of ten people. Second, transforming two-wheeled carts into four-wheeled carts, which doubles the carrying capacity. Third, changing wooden wheels to rubber wheels or nailing rubber to wooden wheels. After nailing rubber to the wooden wheels of each cart, the carrying capacity can be increased by more than 100 jin. After wooden wheels are changed to rubber wheels, the carrying capacity of each cart can be increased by more than 1,000 jin. Fourth, changing pack transport to pull transport. Using camels and donkeys to pull carts increases efficiency by three to ten times compared to pack transport. Fifth, adding harnesses to animal-powered carts, and also transforming carts originally pulled by people into animal-powered carts. Sixth, in the Hexi Corridor area, the wheels of ox carts are very large, and the carriage is very small, with a carrying capacity of only about 400 jin per cart. Now, the carriage has been expanded, and the carrying capacity has increased by half. Seventh, accelerating the use of ball bearings on vehicles.
    According to a survey, for winter wheat with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, a total of 29.5 workdays are required per mu for autumn planting, of which 12.5 workdays are required just for transporting 50,000 jin of manure by cart; now, ball bearings have been installed on the carts, and transportation efficiency has been increased by more than double, reducing the required labor from 12.5 workdays to 5 workdays; further transforming the two-wheeled carts used for transporting manure into four-wheeled carts, the carrying capacity has increased sharply again, and 50,000 jin of manure can be transported with only 2 to 3 workdays of labor. In this way, 10 workdays of labor are saved on just one mu of land. After Lanzhou City adopted technical reform measures such as adding trailers to automobiles and horse-drawn carts, and changing two-wheeled horse-drawn carts to four-wheeled horse-drawn carts, in a short period of time, it transported an additional 150,000 ton-kilometers of materials to support the iron and steel front, which is equivalent to increasing the labor of 100,000 people for one day of carrying.

### 采取七项措施彻底改造车辆  甘肃运输紧张状况大大缓和

    采取七项措施彻底改造车辆
    甘肃运输紧张状况大大缓和
    本报讯　甘肃省不少地区采取七项措施改革各种车辆，提高运输效率，大大缓和了这些地区劳动力不足的困难。
    根据甘肃省的一般情况，农业生产中运输所占的劳动力，占所需全部劳动力的三分之一到一半左右；炼钢炼铁中也约有三分之一的劳动力用在运输线上。运输上所需的劳动力这么多，提高运输效率，就会相对地大大节省了劳动力。
    甘肃省实行运输工具技术改革的主要措施是：一、汽车、畜力车后面加拖斗。马车加拖斗后每次可多拉一千斤，等于增加十个人的体力劳动。二、把双轮大车改造为四轮车，这样载运量就可翻一番多。三、改木轮车为胶轮车或在木轮上钉胶皮。每辆车子的木轮钉上胶皮后，可增加载运量一百斤以上。木轮改胶轮后，每辆车子的载运量可增加一千多斤。四、改驮运为拉运。用骆驼和毛驴拉车，效率比驮运增加三倍至十倍。五、畜力车加套，原来用人拉的车子也改造为畜力车。六、河西走廊一带的牛车，车轮很大，车厢很小，每车的载运量只四百斤左右，现在扩大了车厢，载运量就增加了一半。七、加速车子的滚珠轴承化。
    据调查，亩产千斤的冬麦，秋种时所需的劳动力每亩共为二十九个半工，其中光用大车运粪五万斤就需十二个半工的劳动力；现在在大车上安装了滚珠轴承，运输效率提高了一倍多，所需劳动力就由十二个半工减少到五个工；再把送粪的双轮大车改造成四轮大车，承载量又猛增一倍，五万斤粪肥只要二工到三工的劳动力就可运送完。这样，光一亩地就节省了十个工的劳动力。兰州市采取汽车、马车加拖斗，改双轮马车为四轮马车等技术改革措施后，短短一个时期来，就多运了十五万吨公里的物资增援钢铁战线，等于增加了十万个人工，抬挑一天的劳动量。
