Xinhua News Agency, 1st. Participating in the Asian-African Writers Conference, writers from Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, Senegal and other African countries who were invited to visit China, joined Chinese writers in steelmaking labor on the afternoon of the 31st.

At 3 p.m., writers Mao Dun, Shao Quanlin, Cao Yu, Ge Baoquan, Zhao Shuli, Zhang Tianyi, Chen Baichen, Zang Kejia, Ai Wu, Ye Junjian, Yan Wenjing, Guo Xiaochuan, and staff members of the Chinese Writers Association were working intensely at the steelmaking site. At this moment, Indonesian writer Ananta Toer, Burmese writers U Than Nyo, Maung Kyaung Shin Nyo, U Kyi Myint, Senegalese writers Diop, Ousmane, Thai writer Nai Koola Shibawu, and others came one after another to learn steelmaking. After visiting the construction site and listening to the introduction of the production process, they immediately took off their coats, put on work clothes, put on gloves, came to the front of the steelmaking furnace, and forged steel together with the Chinese writers. Writers from five countries surrounded the indigenous steelmaking furnace, happily starting the furnace, adding materials, and stir-frying iron together, and then, covered in sweat, hammered the molten steel into blocks. The brilliant and splashing sparks of steel ignited the writers' excited applause and laughter. Senegalese writer Ousmane, while vigorously pounding the molten steel, said: "I am unspeakably happy that I can forge a furnace of steel for socialist construction together with Chinese writers and also with the Chinese people today. The furnace of steel that we forged together is completely different from the steel of American imperialism that destroys production and slaughters women and children. Our steel is the steel of unity, the steel of building socialism, and the steel of defending world peace."

    一炉象征亚非团结的钢
    外国作家和我国作家一起炼钢
    新华社1日讯　参加亚非作家会议后，应邀来我国访问的印度尼西亚、缅甸、泰国、非洲塞内加尔等国的作家，31日下午和我国作家一起参加了炼钢劳动。
    下午三时，作家茅盾、邵荃麟、曹禺、戈宝权、赵树理、张天翼、陈白尘、臧克家、艾芜、叶君健、严文井、郭小川等，以及中国作家协会工作人员正在炼钢工地紧张劳动。这时候，印度尼西亚作家阿南达·吐尔，缅甸作家吴达纽、貌觉真纽、吴季棉，塞内加尔作家迪奥普、奥斯曼，泰国作家乃古腊·柿巴五等先后来学炼钢来了。他们参观了工地，听了生产过程介绍后，立即脱去外衣，穿上工作服，带上手套，来到炼钢炉前，和中国作家一道炼起钢来。五个国家的作家们围绕着土造炼钢炉，愉快地一起生炉、加料、炒铁，然后满头大汗地把一炉炉钢浆锤成钢块。那灿烂四溅的钢铁星火，引起了作家们兴奋的掌声和欢笑声。塞内加尔作家奥斯曼一面用力捣着钢浆，一面说：“我今天能和中国作家、也是和中国人民一同为社会主义建设炼出一炉钢，心里说不出的高兴。我们共同炼出的这一炉钢，和美帝国主义破坏生产、屠杀妇孺的钢完全不同，我们的钢是团结的钢，是建设社会主义的钢，是保卫世界和平的钢。”
