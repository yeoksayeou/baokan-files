    "Ten Thousand Ton" Red Flag
    Shi Tianshou
    The ten thousand-ton giant ship is being built,
    Towering like a high mountain;
    Its majestic posture faces the sea,
    Its iron walls stand firm against the blue sky.
    A century of dreams suddenly come true,
    Shipbuilding workers beam with joy;
    The fiery hearts are brighter than the rising sun,
    The red flag is raised high into the clouds.
    Dashing forward like a fierce tiger,
    Leaping up and down like a nimble ape;
    Three-island installation and three-dimensional work, (Note 1)
    New techniques are created, shaking the world.
    Electric sparks flash, hammers and shovels clang,
    Cranes rumble, steel frames turn,
    Workers forget lunch until the job is done,
    Unwilling to stop until the perfect moment.
    When the moon rises, they complain about the short day,
    Fearless of the cold of the five watches of the night;
    Ten days of work are completed in one day,
    Starlight and lamplight accompany the joyful people.
    The hull construction cycle is sixty days, (Note 2)
    The heroic words are not idle boasts,
    Surpassing England and defeating Japan,
    Satellites soar into the universe.
    For this, we cooperate with all our strength,
    Fiery red hearts striving to be first;
    Who fears the sea's demonic flames,
    A single step to heaven makes the enemy tremble.
    Chinese workers are establishing a great undertaking,
    To completely reverse the universe;
    Let the hurricanes stir up huge waves,
    To eternally change the concepts of high and low.
    November 5, 1958, Dalian Nanshan

    Note (1): "Three-island installation" refers to the simultaneous tower installation during shipbuilding in the front, middle, and rear sections, in addition to the mid-section tower installation. This forms three islands, developing upwards, downwards, and centrally at the same time, doubling the installation speed. Simultaneously, three-dimensional installation is carried out, meaning each hull section is completed in the workshop before installation, which is faster than planar installation.

    Note (2): In England and America, the hull construction cycle for a single ship takes four to five months, and in Japan, the fastest is three months. China's first ten thousand-ton ship's hull construction cycle has leaped to two months.

    “万吨”红旗
    师田手
    万吨巨轮正筑起，
    巍峨矗立如高山；
    雄姿伟壮向大海，
    铁壁威严触青天。
    百年梦想顿成真，
    造船工人尽开颜；
    众心赤胆胜旭日，
    红旗高举入云端。
    骁勇横冲似猛虎，
    上下跳跃赛轻猿；
    三岛安装兼立体，（注一）
    新技创造动瀛寰。
    电光闪闪锤铲响，
    吊车隆隆钢架转，
    日午忘餐工未果，
    不到好时心不甘。
    月上楼头怨天短，
    苦战不怕五更寒；
    十日工程一日完，
    星光灯影伴人欢。
    船体周期六十天，（注二）
    英雄豪语非等闲，
    超过英国胜日本，
    卫星飞腾宇宙间。
    为此全力共协作，
    烈火红心犹争先；
    谁怕海上起魔焰，
    一步登天敌胆寒。
    中国工人立伟业，
    要使乾坤全扭转；
    让那飓风掀巨浪，
    有无高低永生变。
    1958年11月5日大连南山
    注（一）：“三岛安装”系造船时除中段塔式安装外，并在前中，后中也同时进行塔式安装。形成三个岛形，三个岛同时向上、中、下发展，安装速度加倍。同时又进行立体安装，即每段船体在作业场作好，再安装，比平面安装快。
    注（二）：英美造船，单船船体建造周期需四、五个月，日本最快三个月。中国这第一条万吨船船体建造周期跃进到两个月。
