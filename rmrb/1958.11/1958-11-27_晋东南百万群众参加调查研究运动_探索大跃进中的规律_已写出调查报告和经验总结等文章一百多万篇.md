Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th: A mass investigation and research movement is currently underway in the Southeastern Shanxi Special District. The purpose of this movement is to mobilize the masses to investigate, summarize, and promote the new creations and experiences in industry, agriculture, and other fronts since this year, in preparation for an even greater leap forward in production next year.

Currently, over one million people in the Southeastern Shanxi Special District have participated in this movement, writing a total of over one and a half million investigation reports, experience summaries, and other articles. Workers at the state-owned Changzhi Huifeng Machine Factory and Huaihai Machine Factory wrote over two thousand articles in fifteen days, mostly summarizing technical experiences in production. The Guguan Steel Plant has surpassed the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in steel production several times this year, with many new technical innovations. In this investigation and research and work summary, workers alone wrote over 15,000 articles. In a production brigade of a people's commune in Licheng County, there were eighty-five canteens, all of which had been poorly managed in the past. Recently, this production brigade summarized the experience and problems of one canteen, investigated and researched the laws of running canteens well, to promote the improvement of canteens in the entire brigade. The county CCP committees have also sent cadres or assigned special personnel to help the masses summarize some important experiences, and finally added comments, preparing to compile them into册.

Southeastern Shanxi Special District has achieved great achievements in industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings this year. Over the past year, many new creations and new figures have emerged throughout the special district. In order to summarize these creations of the masses and use them to promote an even greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production next year, it is necessary to conduct comprehensive investigation and research work. In the past, this work relied solely on a few full-time cadres, but this year, under the new circumstances, a few cadres obviously cannot shoulder this task. In particular, the special district has completed the task of eliminating illiteracy, and the style of workers and peasants studying theory is flourishing. Therefore, in mid-October, the Southeastern Shanxi CCP District Committee made a decision to adopt the method of mass movement, mobilizing the whole party and the whole people to summarize various experiences, and at the same time, dispatch special cadres to select special issues for systematic investigation and research, to explore the laws of the Great Leap Forward. The District Committee believes that this can also cultivate the habit and atmosphere of conducting investigation and research among cadres; and cultivate the ability of workers and peasants to create, research, and summarize themselves. The District Committee also required the secretaries of the county and city CCP committees to personally take action, and select the major creations and key experiences in the entire district, formulating five hundred topics for reference by the counties.

The cadres and workers and peasants participating in this movement include commune members, CCP committee secretaries, factory directors, managers, workers, peasants, shop assistants, teachers, nurses, doctors, and cooks. They generally choose their own topics and write their own articles based on their professional characteristics, so that the masses create, research and summarize themselves, discussing the practical and the theoretical, using the theoretical to lead the practical. After these articles are written, they are read out at group meetings, production team meetings, or commune meetings. In this way, some experiences are further improved through the summary by specialists and collective supplementation, and are promptly promoted, promoting current work.

The Shanxi Provincial CCP Committee recently forwarded the decision of the Southeastern Shanxi District CCP Committee to carry out mass investigation and research work to party committees at all levels throughout the province for promotion. It emphasized that this kind of mass self-summary concentrates the wisdom and talent of the masses, accumulates rich materials for various professional departments and scientific research departments, and provides new methods for investigation and research work; at the same time, it is also an important measure to improve the theoretical level of cadres and the masses.

    晋东南百万群众参加调查研究运动
    探索大跃进中的规律
    已写出调查报告和经验总结等文章一百多万篇
    新华社太原26日电　山西省晋东南专区最近正展开一个群众性的调查研究运动。开展这个运动的目的是：发动群众来调查、总结、推广今年以来在工业、农业和其他各个战线上的新创造和新经验，为明年生产的更大跃进作准备。
    目前，晋东南专区已有一百多万人参加这个运动，写出了各种调查报告、经验总结等文章共一百五十多万篇。国营长治惠丰机器厂和淮海机器厂的工人，在十五天内写了两千多篇文章，内容大部分是生产上技术经验的总结。故县钢铁厂今年几次在钢产量上超过太原钢铁公司，在技术上有许多新的创造。这个厂在这次调查研究和工作总结中，仅工人们写的文章就有一万五千多篇。黎城县一个人民公社的生产大队里，有八十五个食堂，过去都办得不好，最近这个生产大队总结了一个食堂的经验和问题，调查研究办好食堂的规律，来推动全队的食堂改进工作。各县中共党委对一些重要的经验，还派了干部或指定专人帮助群众进行总结，最后还加注评语，准备汇印成册。
    晋东南专区今年在工业、农业、商业、交通运输业和文化教育事业等各方面都取得了巨大成就。一年来，全专区出现了许多新创造、新人物。为了把这些群众的创造加以总结，用来推动明年工农业生产更大的跃进，就需要进行全面的调查研究工作。过去这个工作单纯依靠少数专职干部去做，而今年在新的情况下，少数干部显然担负不了这个任务。特别是全区已经完成扫盲任务，工农群众学习理论之风大兴。因此，中共晋东南地委在10月中旬作出决定，采取群众运动的办法，全党动员全民动手，来总结各项经验，同时并抽调专门干部选定专门问题进行系统的调查研究，探索大跃进中的规律。地委认为，这样做还可以培养干部中经常进行调查研究的习惯与风气；培养工农群众自己创造、自己研究、自己总结的能力。地委还要求各县、市党委书记要亲自动手，并且选择全区的重大创举和关键性的经验，拟出了五百个题目，供各县参考。
    参加这个运动的干部和工农群众，包括公社社员、党委书记、厂长、经理、工人、农民、店员、教员、护士、医生和炊事员。他们一般都是根据业务特点自选题目自作文章，做到群众自己创造，自己研究总结，就实论虚，以虚带实。这些文章写出来以后，都分别在小组会、生产队会或公社大会上宣读。这样，就使一些经验通过专人总结和集体补充而进一步得到提高，并且又及时推广开来，推动了当前的工作。
    中共山西省委最近把晋东南地委开展群众性的调查研究工作的决定，批转全省各级党委推广。并强调指出，这种群众性的自我总结，既集中了群众的智慧和才华，又为各专业部门和科学研究部门积累了丰富的资料，为调查研究工作提供了新的方法；同时也是提高干部和群众理论水平的一项重要措施。
