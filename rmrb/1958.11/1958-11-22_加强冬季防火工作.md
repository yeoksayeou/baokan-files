    Strengthen Winter Fire Prevention Work

    In recent months, many major fires have occurred in various places, resulting in significant losses. On September 16th, a workers' shed at a small blast furnace site in Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, caught fire due to a worker's careless use of a lamp, resulting in the deaths of seven people and injuries to forty-one others. On October 26th, a major fire at the Harbin Thermal Power Plant construction site destroyed the civil engineering of the main plant building under construction and all the steel bars that had been tied together, resulting in a loss of nearly 300,000 yuan. On November 2nd, a warehouse of the First Ministry of Machine Building in Shanghai also suffered a major fire, with losses exceeding 2 million yuan. In addition, the Dagu Chemical Plant in Tianjin, the Yinchuan Flax Factory, the Zhajialu shantytown area in Jiang'an District of Wuhan City, and the Shunjiang People's Commune in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, have also suffered serious losses due to fires.

    These reports once again tell us that fire is indeed an enemy that cannot be ignored. The people of the whole country are required to pay serious attention to the struggle against fire.

    Since the State Council issued the "Instructions on Strengthening Fire Protection Work" and the "Fire Supervision Regulations" last year, especially since the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the departments concerned and the broad masses have done a lot of work in preventing fires and protecting the Great Leap Forward in production, and have successively launched safety campaigns, achieving great results. Throughout the country, a large number of fire safety streets, safety villages, safety societies, and safety factories and enterprises have emerged. Many places have greatly reduced or even eliminated the occurrence of fires, effectively safeguarding the safe leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. However, the development of fire protection work is still uneven. After the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, wealth has grown and concentrated rapidly, and the use of fire sources, power sources, and flammable materials has increased significantly. These situations remind people that the factors causing fires have increased compared to the past, and fire prevention measures must be better strengthened. However, some factories, enterprises, and people's communes, when busy with production, neglect fire prevention arrangements, and even a few people disregard fire safety in production, take risks, and attempt to be lucky. In addition, the public security fire forces in many places are weak, and the mass voluntary fire organizations are still very imperfect. After a fire occurs, it often spreads into a disaster because it cannot be effectively controlled and extinguished. All of this shows that the development of fire protection work cannot meet the requirements of the objective situation. This situation must be changed quickly.

    At present, winter has arrived. Due to climatic reasons, winter is the season most prone to fires. This winter's fire prevention task is even more arduous. As everyone knows, at present, the whole people are fighting for steel. There is a lot of use of fire and electricity in steelmaking and ironmaking. The workers' sheds in the smelting sites are generally very flammable and are mostly together with the furnace groups. Some furnaces are also built near flammable buildings, and the masses lack the necessary fire prevention knowledge. This year, the national rural agricultural crops have achieved unprecedented harvests, and grain and cotton inventories are crowded. Most of the warehouse buildings are also very simple. In terms of basic construction, a large part of the task must be accelerated to be completed this winter, and winter construction will use more electricity, fire, and insulation materials than usual. All of these put forward extremely arduous tasks for this winter's fire prevention work, which must be given sufficient attention. Any slackness or 麻痹 will bring incalculable losses.

    In order to strengthen winter fire prevention work, the Ministry of Public Security recently issued a circular, requiring all localities, under the unified deployment of party committees and people's committees at all levels, to earnestly implement the policy of "the whole people running fire protection, focusing on prevention and supplemented by elimination," combining the center, focusing on production, with the protection of steel production, industrial enterprises, people's communes, and infrastructure construction sites as the focus, and launching a mass fire prevention climax through discussions, debates, and rectification. This is very necessary and correct. The people of the whole country should, while doing their jobs well, actively participate in this movement, heighten their vigilance, and strive to eliminate fire hazards and safeguard the safe leap forward in industrial and agricultural production!

### 加强冬季防火工作

    加强冬季防火工作
    近几个月来，不少地方连续发生了多起重大火灾，损失很大。9月16日，安徽桐城县一小高炉工地的工棚，因工人使用灯火不慎起火，有七人被烧死，四十一人被烧伤。10月26日，哈尔滨热电站工地大火，将正在建设中的热电站主厂房的土木工程和已经绑扎成型的钢筋全部烧毁，损失将近三十万元。11月2日，第一机械工业部在上海的一个仓库也发生了大火，损失二百多万元。此外，天津大沽化工厂、银川亚麻厂、武汉市江岸区查家路棚屋区、四川省内江县顺江人民公社等，也都因为火灾而造成了严重损失。
    这些消息再次告诉我们，火灾的确是一个不容忽视的敌人。要求全国人民对于同火灾的斗争给予严重的注意。
    自从国务院在去年颁发了“关于加强消防工作的指示”和“消防监督条例”后，尤其是工农业生产大跃进以来，各有关部门和广大群众在预防火灾、保卫生产大跃进方面做了很多工作，并相继开展了安全运动，取得了很大的成绩。在全国各地，出现了大批的防火安全街、安全乡、安全社和安全工厂、企业单位。有不少地方已经大大减少甚至杜绝了火灾的发生，较有成效地保卫了工农业生产安全跃进。但是消防工作的发展还是不平衡。工农业生产大跃进后，财富迅速增长和集中，使用火源、电源和易燃物质大量增多。这些情况都提醒人们：起火因素比过去增多了，必须更好地加强防火措施。但有些工厂、企业和人民公社在忙于生产时，对防火工作疏于安排，甚至还有少数人员在生产中不顾防火安全，冒险操作，冀图侥幸。加之不少地方的公安消防力量薄弱，群众性的义务消防组织还极不健全，发生火灾后往往因不能有效地加以控制和扑灭而蔓延成灾。所有这些，都说明消防工作的发展还不能适应于客观形势的要求。这种状况必须迅速加以改变。
    目前冬季已到。由于气候的原因，冬季是最容易发生火灾的季节。而今年冬季的防火任务则更为繁重。大家知道，目前全民都在为钢铁而战。炼钢炼铁中，用火用电很多，冶炼工地的工棚一般都很易燃，且多与炉群在一起，有些炉子还建在易燃建筑附近，群众也缺乏必要的防火常识。全国农村今年农作物获得空前丰收，粮棉库存拥挤，多数的库房建筑也很简陋。在基本建设方面，还有很大一部分任务要在今冬加速完成，而冬季施工则要比平常使用更多的电、火和保温材料。所有这些，都为今冬的防火工作提出了极为艰巨的任务，必须给以足够的重视，任何松懈麻痹，都会带来不可估量的损失。
    为了加强冬季防火工作，公安部于最近发出通报，要求各地在各级党委和人民委员会的统一部署下，认真贯彻“全民办消防，以防为主、以消为辅”的方针，结合中心，围绕生产，以保卫钢铁生产、工业企业、人民公社、基建工地为重点，通过鸣放、辩论和整改，掀起一个群众性的防火高潮，这是十分必要和正确的。全国人民应该在做好本岗位工作的同时，积极投入这一运动，提高警惕，为消除火灾危害，保卫工农业生产安全跃进而奋斗！
