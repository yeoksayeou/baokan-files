    Oil Gushes in the Lenghu Exploration Zone
    During the drilling process, a test well in the No. 5 structure of the Lenghu Exploration Zone in the Qaidam Basin gushed a large amount of crude oil, with a daily output of more than 500 tons, continuously for several days. It was only subdued after several days of hard work by the exploration zone staff. This test well was officially tested for oil on October 29th. During the testing period, even with the smallest nozzle, it still gushed 183 tons of oil per day, with extremely stable output.

    The oil gusher from this test well proves that the Lenghu No. 5 structure is not only an oil field with a large oil-bearing area, but also the oil field with the highest output among the known oil fields in Qaidam.

    冷湖探区喷油
    柴达木盆地冷湖探区五号构造一口探井，在钻进过程中喷出大量原油，每日喷油量达五百多吨，连续喷了几天。经探区职工几天苦战才压住。这口探井在10月29日正式试油。在试油期间用最小的油嘴，每天仍喷油一百八十三吨，产量极为稳定。
    这口探井的喷油，证明冷湖五号构造不但是一个含油面积很大的油田，而且是柴达木已知油田当中产量最高的油田。
