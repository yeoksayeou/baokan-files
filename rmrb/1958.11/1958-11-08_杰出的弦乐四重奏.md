Outstanding String Quartet
    Li Guoquan

    The quartet named after the great Czechoslovakian patriotic musician Smetana performed in Beijing for the first time on the evening of the 4th of this month. They are one of the finest string quartets in the world. It is the first time that such a professional quartet has visited our country to perform, and music lovers in Beijing have enthusiastically welcomed and appreciated their superb artistry.

    The Smetana Quartet, like other quartets in the world, has its own characteristics and its own style. In terms of the works they perform, not only have the works of famous masters from all over the world become part of their repertoire, but more importantly, they are based on the musical works of their own country. Secondly, their playing – first violin by Jiri Novak, second violin by Lubomir Kostecky, viola by Milan Skampa, and cello by Antonin Kohout – all possess the strong stylistic characteristics of the Czech violin school, which has had a profound impact on violin art around the world. On this basis, using skillful techniques and meticulous cooperation, they have perfectly interpreted the works of the great Czechoslovakian national musicians Smetana and Janáček, and have also profoundly expressed the spirit of Mozart's works.

    Their precision of cooperation and the rigor of artistic creation have reached an astonishing level. They have an iron-like rhythm, but are not constrained in the slightest; they have extremely delicate dynamic arrangements, but the expression of emotion is extremely free and unrestrained, which is particularly evident in their performance of Janáček's Second String Quartet. They memorize entire sets (without looking at the score) of large-scale quartet works and perform them meticulously, which proves that their daily hard work is persistent. Before performing in each place, they never go out for sightseeing, but conduct rigorous rehearsals, even for works that have been performed hundreds of times, they still rehearse and study them further. This also shows their serious and earnest attitude towards artistic work. Their efforts to promote national musical art will serve as a good reference for Chinese musicians.

    The Czechoslovak government has awarded them a first-class national prize to commend their outstanding achievements and contributions in building the country's musical culture. They are true artists and enthusiastic promoters of their country's musical and cultural undertakings. They are worthy of being named after the glorious name of Smetana.

    Their performances in Beijing have left an indelible impression on people. We wish them greater success in their visit and performances in other parts of our country!

    杰出的弦乐四重奏
    黎国荃
    以捷克斯洛伐克伟大的爱国主义音乐家斯美塔那命名的四重奏团，本月4日晚在北京首次演出。他们是世界上优秀的弦乐四重奏团之一。像这样专业的四重奏团来我国访问演出还是第一次，北京的音乐爱好者以兴奋的心情热诚地欢迎和欣赏了他们高超的艺术。
    斯美塔那四重奏团和世界上其他的四重奏团一样，有他们自己的特点，有他们自己的风格；在演奏的作品方面，不仅世界各国名家的作品都已成为他们的保留节目，更重要的是，他们是以自己祖国的音乐作品作基础的。其次是他们的演奏——第一提琴手由耶利·诺瓦克，第二提琴手路保米尔·柯斯塔茨基，中音提琴手米兰·斯坎巴，大提琴手安托宁·柯霍特——都具有强烈的捷克提琴学派的风格特点，这种提琴学派曾对全世界的提琴艺术有着深远的影响。在这样的基础之上，他们运用熟练的技巧和精心的合作，对捷克斯洛伐克伟大的民族音乐家斯美塔那及扬那切克的作品进行了完美的解释，同样也深刻地表现了莫扎特作品的精神。
    他们合作的精确，和艺术创造的严谨已达到了惊人的地步，他们有铁一般的节奏，但丝毫不受到拘束；他们有极为细腻的力度安排，但情感的表现却极为自由奔放，特别在演奏扬那切克的第二弦乐四重奏中体现了这一点。他们成套的记忆（不看乐谱）大型的四重奏作品，演奏起来一丝不苟，这就证明了他们平日所进行的辛勤劳动是坚持不懈的。他们每到一地演出之前，从不外出游览，而是进行严格的排练，那怕是演出过上百次的作品，也同样拿来进一步排练和研究探讨，这也说明了他们对待艺术工作的认真严肃态度。他们这种为民族音乐艺术发扬光大而做的努力，将成为中国音乐工作者良好的借鉴。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府为了表扬他们在建设祖国音乐文化方面的杰出成就和功绩，曾经授予他们一级国家奖金。他们是真正的艺术家，是热心于祖国音乐文化事业的促进者，他们以斯美塔那这一光辉的名字命名，是当之无愧的。
    他们在北京的演出，给人们留下了不可磨灭的印象。预祝他们在我国其他各地的访问演出获得更大的成功！
