Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: As winter approaches, the more than 20,000 nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) run by the masses in Beijing are actively taking various measures to seize the time to solve the problem of winter housing and cold-proof equipment.

The Party and the government are very concerned about the winterization of nurseries and preschool organizations run by the masses. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee held a special joint meeting of district heads to study and arrange this work. In addition, it instructed relevant departments to help nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) solve the problem of heating equipment. The commercial departments of various districts in the urban area have given priority to supplying stoves and stovepipes to some nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) that do not have heating equipment. Beijing Coal Industry Building Materials Company has also begun to supply coal for heating to nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes).

Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, streets and rural areas in Beijing are systematically allocating some houses to nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes). Many parents of children have also sent stoves, stovepipes, small tables, small chairs, small beds, quilts, etc. from their homes to the nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes). After the Fengsheng Hutong Office allocated houses for the kindergarten classes, each room accommodates an average of nine children, ensuring that the children have a place to move around indoors in winter. Twenty-four kindergarten classes of Dafangjia Hutong Office held a collaboration meeting. Many kindergarten classes that were established earlier voluntarily took out surplus stoves and stovepipes to support the newly established kindergarten classes to get through the winter. Many kindergartens and nursery classes have also added toys, preparing to carry out indoor games in winter.

Many communes in the suburbs are building *kangs*, building cooking stoves, making stoves, and building children's dining halls for the children's teams and nurseries. Yuko and Hanzhuang People's Communes in Pinggu County have allocated houses for the children's teams and carried out necessary repairs. The Dongfeng People's Commune in Yanqing County has solved the heating problem for many kindergarten classes by combining with the establishment of canteens. The outer room of the Hanjia Chuan kindergarten class is used as a children's dining hall, and the fire from the stove is connected to the *kang* in the inner room, so the *kang* is warm and the room is also warm.

At present, the relevant Party committees, education bureaus, health bureaus, women's federations, and other units in Beijing have united to comprehensively check the winter preparation work of various nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes).

    北京市采取积极措施
    解决托儿所过冬问题
    新华社25日讯　冬天到了，北京群众自办的两万多个托儿所（站）和幼儿园（班），正积极采取各种措施，抓紧解决过冬房屋和防寒的设备。
    党和政府非常关心群众自办的托儿和幼儿组织的过冬问题。北京市人民委员会曾专门召开区长联席会议，研究和安排这个工作；另外还指示有关部门帮助各托儿所（站）和幼儿园（班）解决取暖设备。城区各区商业部门已优先给一些没有取暖设备的托儿所（站）幼儿园（班）供应炉子、烟筒。北京市煤业建筑器材公司也已开始供应托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）取暖用煤炭。
    在各级党委的领导下，北京市各街道、农村正在有计划地调剂出一些房屋给托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班），许多孩子的家长也纷纷把家中的火炉、烟筒、小桌子、小椅子、小床、棉被等送到托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）里去。丰盛胡同办事处为幼儿班调剂房子以后，平均每间房容纳九个孩子，保证孩子们冬季里在室内有活动的场所。大方家胡同办事处的二十四个幼儿班在一起开了协作会议，许多成立较久的幼儿班自动拿出多余的炉子、烟筒支援新成立的幼儿班过冬。许多幼儿园、托儿班还增添了玩具，准备在冬天开展室内游戏活动。
    郊区许多公社已在为幼儿队、托儿所搭炕、砌锅台、做炉子、盖儿童食堂。平谷县峪口和韩庄人民公社已为幼儿队调拨了房子，并进行了必要的修缮。延庆县东风人民公社结合办食堂，解决了许多幼儿班的取暖问题。汉家川幼儿班外间屋作儿童食堂，把炉灶的火通到里屋的炕里，炕热了屋子也暖了。
    现在，北京市各有关党委、教育局、卫生局、妇女联合会等单位已联合起来，全面检查各托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）过冬的准备工作。
