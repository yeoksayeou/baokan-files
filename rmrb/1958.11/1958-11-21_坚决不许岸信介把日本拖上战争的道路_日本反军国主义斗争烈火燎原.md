Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- Tokyo dispatch: The struggles of various Japanese labor unions and other organizations against the Kishi Nobusuke government's "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" and against the "Performance Rating" system are gaining momentum like wildfire.

The resolution of the protest rally demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party immediately withdraw the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" and dissolve the Diet.

Participants in the rally also held a lantern parade.

The Osaka Regional Council of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) decided at a meeting of its executive committee today on a plan to participate in the joint struggle against the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" on November 26.

According to this plan, the regional council will convene a rally of 3,000 members of the labor union's youth departments and youth organizations in Osaka City on the afternoon of November 24; on the 25th, it will hold a mother-daughter rally for female labor union members and women's organizations, and plans to hold a demonstration after the meeting; on the day of the nationwide joint struggle on the 26th, the regional council will convene 40,000 labor union members from 2:30 p.m. onwards to hold the Osaka Prefecture People's General Uprising Rally in Osaka City, followed by a demonstration.

Various Osaka labor unions participating in Sohyo are also preparing to hold limited-time strikes or workplace rallies, such as 24-hour strikes, on the 26th. The Osaka Regional Headquarters of the National Railway Workers' Union has decided to hold workplace rallies during working hours in three locations. Private railway company unions have also decided to hold a one-hour strike from the first train of the day and to hold workplace rallies.

The Kyoto Regional Council of Sohyo has also decided that on the 26th, members of its affiliated unions will hold workplace rallies during working hours or hold limited-time strikes, while refusing to work overtime.

The All-Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union decided at a meeting of its central executive committee today that on November 26, the day that Sohyo is scheduled to hold a joint struggle, members of the All-Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union will hold a two-hour strike starting at noon that day.

The central executive committee meeting also decided that in order to demand wage increases from the management, the union members will hold a 24-hour strike starting at 6:00 a.m. on November 28, followed by a 48-hour strike starting on the 29th. The union has instructed each branch to implement the above decisions. The meeting also decided to demand that the management pay each worker a year-end bonus equivalent to two months' salary. The Fukuoka Prefectural Teachers' Union decided at its regular convention held in Fukuoka today that on November 26, the day the Japan Teachers' Union will conduct a joint struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and the "Performance Rating" system, each branch of the Fukuoka Prefectural Teachers' Union should hold workplace rallies in accordance with the Japan Teachers' Union's policy.

The regular convention also decided that if the municipal, town, and village education committees of Fukuoka Prefecture issue "Performance Rating Forms" for principals to fill out, union members will take actions such as stopping classes at noon, refusing duty, and going on hunger strikes.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th -- Tokyo dispatch: The Kishi Nobusuke government and the National Railway Corporation authorities are intensifying their persecution of workers who participated in the struggle against the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment."

The Tokyo Railway Administration of the company announced today that it would punish 522 members of the National Railway Workers' Union and the National Railway Locomotive Workers' Union because they had participated in the mass struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" on November 5.

The Akita Railway Administration of the company also announced this morning that it would impose penalties such as suspension from duty, salary reduction, and warnings on 155 employees who had participated in the struggle on the 5th.

Inoue, the manager of the company's western branch, said on the 18th that he would punish approximately 2,000 employees who had participated in the struggle on the 5th before the 26th, and that he planned to punish union leaders after the 26th.

The police authorities of Fukui Prefecture arrested Hiroto Okimura, secretary-general of the Hokuriku Regional Headquarters of the National Railway Workers' Union, and four others today, and forcibly searched some offices of the National Railway Workers' Union and the homes of union members.

The Hokuriku Regional Headquarters of the National Railway Workers' Union launched a joint struggle against the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" on the 5th, so the police authorities took persecutory actions against the union's cadres and members.

Regardless of the persecution and threats from the Kishi Nobusuke government and the railway company authorities, the workers of the Japan National Railway Corporation have decided to continue their struggle against the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment." The Osaka Regional Headquarters of the National Railway Workers' Union held a struggle committee meeting tonight, and the meeting decided to mobilize workers to hold workplace rallies during working hours when participating in the joint struggle on the 26th.

Union members returned the punishment notices to the prefectural education committee that day.

Takeshi Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan Teachers' Union, who arrived in Wakayama City that day, said: "In the future, we will launch a struggle to cancel the punishment nationwide as we carry out the struggle to prevent the authorities from implementing the performance rating system."

Kobayashi said that the Japan Teachers' Union is preparing to conduct its fifth nationwide joint struggle in mid-December.

The Fukuoka Prefectural High School Teachers' Union decided on the 19th that all members of the union would participate in the joint struggle against the "Performance Rating" system and the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" scheduled to be held by the Japan Teachers' Union on November 26. Teachers will stop classes at 2:00 p.m. on that day and hold protest rallies by branch.

The Fukuoka Prefectural Teachers' Union also established a temporary struggle headquarters against the implementation of the "Performance Rating" system in Buzen City on the 17th.

Kishi Nobusuke's policy of illegally suppressing teachers has even aroused dissatisfaction among local government officials. Torazo Ninagawa, the governor of Kyoto Prefecture, said on the 18th that he opposed adding administrative crimes to teachers. (Attached picture)
