Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan — Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, has basically achieved semi-mechanization in harvesting, threshing, farming, planting, and transportation, greatly alleviating the contradictions between the tight autumn harvest and winter planting tasks and the shortage of labor.

Yingcheng County, relying on the masses, made do with whatever was available, and used indigenous methods to manufacture a large number of new-style tools in just over a month, achieving quick harvesting with sickle substitutes, threshing machine utilization, row planting with row planters, deep plowing with improved plows, and vehicle and boat transport. After realizing the "five transformations" and properly arranging labor, the county averaged one sickle substitute for every ten mu of land, one threshing machine for every seventy mu, and one row planter for every one hundred and sixty mu. The efficiency of these new-style tools is several times, even ten times, higher than that of the old tools. In harvesting alone, using sickle substitutes can save more than 400,000 man-days compared to using sickles. Adding the row planters, threshing machines, etc., a total of more than 3.2 million man-days can be saved. In this way, not only was the difficulty of labor shortage completely overcome, but also various agricultural tasks were completed ahead of schedule.

The realization of the "five transformations" in major agricultural tasks in Yingcheng County is the result of advanced thinking overcoming conservative thinking. This year's autumn harvest and winter sowing tasks are much larger than in any previous year, the quality requirements are also much higher than in previous years, and the time is so tight. Therefore, some people once advocated reducing the winter sowing area, lowering the quality of the autumn harvest and winter sowing, and extending the time to alleviate the contradiction of labor shortage. However, others opposed this view, believing that under the leadership of the Party, any difficulties could be overcome. Thus, a great debate was launched throughout the county. The Sheng Tan Brigade of the Red Flag Commune, on the basis of breaking down conservative ideas, manufactured more than 100 new tools in just a few days. The county party committee immediately held an on-site meeting in this brigade, which further liberated the thinking of cadres and the masses.

In the process of realizing the "five transformations," Yingcheng County conscientiously relied on the masses, adopting the methods of everyone contributing ideas, every household contributing materials, everyone learning carpentry, and every wan (village) running a factory. As a result, many tools were produced quickly. The county's more than 40,000 sickle substitutes and more than 5,000 threshing machines were all made in just a few days, and they were diverse in form and very popular with the masses.

    应城县依靠群众利用土法
    收打耕种运输半机械化
    新华社武汉讯　湖北省应城县的收、打、耕、种和运输都基本实现半机械化，大大缓和了秋收冬种任务紧张和劳动力不足的矛盾。
    应城县依靠群众，因陋就简，利用土办法，一个多月就制造出大批新式工具，做到了割谷快速割禾器化、打谷脱粒机化、播种条播器化、翻地深耕犁化、运输车船化。实现了“五化”和妥善安排劳力以后，全县平均每十亩田有一部割禾器，每七十亩有一部脱粒机，一百六十亩有一部条播器，这些新式工具的工效比旧工具提高几倍以至十倍以上。仅收割一项，使用割禾器比用镰刀可节省人工四十多万个，加上条播器、脱粒机等总共可以节省三百二十多万个人工。这样，不仅完全克服了劳力不足的困难，还使各项农活提前完成。
    应城县在主要农活上实现“五化”，是先进思想战胜了保守思想的结果。今年秋收冬播任务比过去任何一年都大得多，质量要求也比往年高得多，时间又那么紧迫，因此有些人曾经主张减少冬播面积，降低秋收冬种质量，延长时间，以缓和劳力不足的矛盾。但是另一些人反对这种主张，他们认为：在党的领导下，什么困难都能克服。于是全县开展了一场大辩论。红旗公社圣滩大队在破除保守思想的基础上，几天就造出新工具一百多件。县委立即在这个队召开了现场会，又进一步解放了干部和群众的思想。
    应城县在实现“五化”过程中认真地依靠群众，采取人人献计，户户献料，人人学木匠，塆塆（村）办工厂的办法，因此造出的工具多，进度快。全县四万多部割禾器、五千多部脱粒机，都只花几天就造成了，并且形式多样，很受群众欢迎。
