    The construction of a ship is divided into three stages: The first stage is to prepare the hull components in the workshop (such as lofting, cutting, and bending steel plates, etc.); the second stage is to assemble various components into the hull on the slipway; the third stage is the installation and outfitting work after the hull is launched (installing machinery, instruments, equipment, and arranging rooms inside the hull, etc.).

    The second stage, from laying the keel on the slipway to assembling the hull and launching it into the water (launching), is called the "slipway cycle." Whether shipbuilding is fast or slow mainly depends on whether the "slipway cycle" is short or long. After the installation and outfitting work is completed, the ship is considered fully built and can begin sailing.

    造船三阶段
    建造一艘轮船分三个阶段：第一个阶段是在车间里准备船体构件（如放样，切割和弯曲钢板等）；第二个阶段是在造船台上把各式各样构件装配成船体；第三个阶段是船体下水后的安装工程和舣装工程（在船体内部安装机械、仪器、装备品和装置房间等）。
    第二个阶段从船底开始铺上船台，到船体装配完成，从船台上滑下水去（下水），这个时期叫做“船台周期”。造船速度快或慢，主要是看“船台周期”短还是长。安装和舣装工程结束以后，轮船才算全部建造完工，可以开始航行。
