    Thoroughly Criticize and Eliminate Bourgeois Academic Thought
    
    Philosophy Circle Criticizes Feng Youlan's Idealist Philosophical Views
    
    Recently, philosophy workers across the country have launched a critique of Feng Youlan's idealist thought. Feng Youlan is a typical representative of the bourgeoisie in China's philosophical circles. Before liberation, he wrote many idealist works. After liberation, he continued to publish more than eighty articles, adhering to his idealist stance and views. From last year to now, Feng Youlan has put forward many erroneous arguments, the most prominent of which are: First, he proposed the abstract inheritance method. He said that philosophical propositions can be divided into abstract meanings and concrete meanings, and the concrete meanings of some propositions cannot be inherited, but their abstract meanings can be inherited. From the perspective of abstract inheritance, "philosophical thought has something that serves all classes." Second, he confused the boundaries between historical materialism and historical idealism. He believes that there was historical materialism even before Marxism. Third, he proposed the theory of social division of labor. He believes that there are two types of people in society, one that does more practical work and one that does more theoretical work. People engaged in practical work can only play a role in transforming the world, while people engaged in theoretical work can play a role in explaining the world, and the latter is more advanced. Therefore, he proposed a formula: theory - practice - theory.
    
    Feng Youlan's erroneous arguments have been refuted by the vast number of philosophy workers. More concentrated criticisms were conducted at the China Philosophy History Symposium held at Peking University in May last year; the Philosophy Department of Peking University held two criticism meetings in July this year; the China Philosophy History Group of the Philosophy Institute of the Academy of Sciences held two criticism meetings; and the Philosophy Department of Renmin University of China also wrote critical articles, which were compiled and printed. In addition, many philosophy workers have written articles individually or incidentally to put forward criticisms.
    
    Regarding Feng Youlan's abstract inheritance method, Hu Sheng pointed out in "On the Study of the History of Philosophy" that he "abstracts their essential attributes in our minds, summarizes some other similarities between them, and thinks that this can be used to prove that a part of philosophical thought has no class nature, which can only be said to be a kind of conceptual game." Wu Chuanqi, in his article "Looking at Feng Youlan's Philosophical Views from His Abstract Inheritance Method," revealed the internal connection between this inheritance method and Feng Youlan's old book "New Rationalism." Wu Chuanqi also used the reactionary content of Feng Youlan's old books "New Rationalism" and "New World Admonitions" as examples to prove that the so-called "philosophy that serves all classes" is deceptive. Regarding Feng Youlan's confusion of the boundaries between historical materialism and historical idealism, Guan Feng pointed out in "Opposing Revisionism in the Work of the History of Philosophy" that this is a direct violation of Marxism, because Marxist classical writers have always believed that there was no historical materialism before Marxism. Regarding Feng Youlan's theory of social division of labor, some young philosophy workers revealed at a criticism meeting that this is a remnant of Feng Youlan's past thoughts of "inheriting the past and opening up the future" and "inner sage and outer king." Chen Boda pointed out in "Under the Banner of Comrade Mao Zedong" that Feng Youlan's anti-materialist formula of "theory - practice - theory" is "to ask you to be a leading, useless 'philosopher' to the people, to ask you to still come from the so-called 'theory' that you meditate in your study, and then return to the 'theory' that you meditate in your study."
    
    Currently, this critical work is still ongoing.
    
    History Department of Zhongshan University Criticizes Chen Yinke's Idealist View of History
    
    Recently, the History Department of Zhongshan University has been vigorously carrying out the critical work of bourgeois academic thought, focusing on criticizing Professor Chen Yinke's idealist historical views. Chen Yinke is one of the leading figures in China's bourgeois historiography and has a considerable influence in the historical field. In the past, many people had blind worship of him, thinking that his achievements were an unattainable peak. This time, after the entire department broke down superstitions and liberated their minds, they wrote a total of thirty-six papers criticizing Chen Yinke's academic thought. From Chen Yinke's political thought to his research methods, there are special articles to criticize him; some of Chen Yinke's important works, such as "A Brief Discussion on the Origins of the Sui and Tang Dynasties" "A Discussion on the Political History of the Tang Dynasty" and "A Proofreading of Yuan Bai's Poems," have all been written with special critical papers; in addition, Chen Yinke's theory of Western culture, racial superiority, and erroneous views on the people have also been written with special articles to criticize him. In addition, some faculty, staff and students who had attended Chen Yinke's lectures also exposed and criticized the bourgeois thoughts he spread in class.
    
    Linguistics Circle Criticizes the Erroneous Views of Wang Li and Others
    
    Some time ago, the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of Peking University conducted an exposure and criticism of bourgeois views in language teaching and research. Many criticisms are concentrated on the book "General Linguistics" written by Gao Mingkai. Everyone criticized the bourgeois views expressed in the book and pointed out that the author peddled a large number of goods from Western European bourgeois linguists such as Vendryes and Grammont. Wang Li's bourgeois academic views have also been criticized. Fourth-year students also printed two collections of papers criticizing Wang Li's bourgeois academic thought, with a total of fourteen articles and about 100,000 words. Some of these papers criticize Wang Li's partial works (such as "Chinese Grammar Theory"), some specifically criticize his certain erroneous views (such as the erroneous views on the grammar system), and some specifically criticize his attitude towards scholarship. In addition, everyone also criticized the bourgeois academic views of Cen Lin, Yuan Jialin, Zhu Dexi, Zhou Zumo and Wei Jiangong.
    
    The recent two issues of the "Chinese Language" monthly (Nos. 9 and 10, 1958) have continuously published articles criticizing bourgeois academic thought. The ninth issue published an editorial entitled "Launching a Criticism of Bourgeois Academic Thought in the Linguistics Circle." The editorial said that the situation of bourgeois thought existing in the linguistics circle is serious, mainly manifested in being divorced from politics, divorced from the masses, and divorced from reality. A considerable number of language workers are only engaged in teaching or research from the perspective of personal interests and personal benefits, and thorough inspection and criticism must be carried out. The editorial also said that in the past, "Chinese Language" did not fulfill its responsibility for academic criticism, and now it has decided to publish articles criticizing bourgeois academic thought in the linguistics circle one after another. These articles published in these two issues focused on criticizing the bourgeois views of Wang Li, Gao Mingkai, Lü Shuxiang, and Li Jinxi. In addition, the tenth issue also published a self-criticism article by Gao Mingkai.

    彻底批判和清除资产阶级学术思想
    哲学界批判冯友兰的唯心主义哲学观点
    最近一个时期，全国哲学工作者对冯友兰的唯心主义思想开展了批判。冯友兰是资产阶级在我国哲学界的一个典型代表。解放以前，他写过许多唯心主义的著作。解放以后，他继续发表八十余篇文章，坚持其唯心主义的立场和观点。从去年到现在，冯友兰又提出不少错误的论点，其中较突出的是：一，提出抽象继承法。他说，哲学命题可分为抽象的意义和具体的意义，某些命题的具体意义不能继承，而其抽象意义却可以继承。从抽象继承来看，“哲学思想中有为一切阶级服务的东西”。二，混淆历史唯物主义同历史唯心主义的界限。他认为在马克思主义以前，也是有历史唯物主义的。三，提出社会分工说。他认为社会上有两种人，一种是多做实际工作，一种是多做理论工作。从事实际工作的人只能起改造世界的作用，从事理论工作的人才能起说明世界的作用，而后者是较高明的。因此，他提出一个公式：理论——实践——理论。
    冯友兰的这些错误论点，遭到了广大哲学工作者的驳斥。较集中地进行批判的，有去年5月间在北大召开的中国哲学史座谈会；今年7月间北大哲学系召开了两次批判会；科学院哲学研究所中国哲学史组召开了两次批判会；中国人民大学哲学系也写了批判文章，编印成册。此外，许多哲学工作者都单独撰文或附带撰文提出批判。
    关于冯友兰的抽象继承法，胡绳在“关于哲学史的研究”一文中指出，他“在我们头脑里把它们的本质属性抽象掉，把它们之间的其他某种相似处概括起来，就以为由此可以反过来证明有一部分哲学思想没有阶级性，这只能说是一种观念游戏。”吴传启在“从冯友兰先生的抽象继承法看他的哲学观点”一文中，揭露了这种继承法同冯友兰的旧著“新理学”的内在联系。吴传启还以冯友兰的旧著“新理学”和“新世训”的反动内容为例，证明了所谓“为一切阶级服务的哲学”是骗人的。关于冯友兰的混淆历史唯物主义同历史唯心主义的界限，关锋在“反对哲学史工作中的修正主义”一文中指出，这是直接违反马克思主义的，因为马克思主义经典作家从来认为马克思主义以前是没有历史唯物主义的。关于冯友兰的社会分工说，一些青年哲学工作者在一次批判会上，揭露了这是冯友兰过去的“继往开来”、“内圣外王”思想的残余。陈伯达在“在毛泽东同志的旗帜下”一文中指出，冯友兰提出这个反唯物主义的“理论——实践——理论”的公式，就是“要你们做一个领头的、对人民毫无用处的‘哲学家’，要你们还是从书斋里冥想的所谓‘理论’中来，再回到你们书斋里所冥想的‘理论’中去。”
    目前，这个批判工作还在继续进行。
    中山大学历史系批判陈寅恪的唯心史观
    最近，中山大学历史系大搞资产阶级学术思想批判工作，着重地批判了陈寅恪教授的唯心主义历史观点。陈寅恪是中国资产阶级史学界泰斗之一，在史学界有着相当大的影响。过去，不少人对他有盲目崇拜思想，认为他的成就是不可企及的高峰。这次，全系在破除迷信、解放思想后，共写出了批判陈寅恪学术思想的论文三十六篇。从陈寅恪的政治思想到他的治学方法，都有专文加以批判；对陈寅恪的一些重要著作，如“隋唐制度渊源略论稿”、“唐代政治史述论稿”和“元白诗笺证稿”等书，都写有专篇批判论文；其余如对陈寅恪的文化西来说，种族优劣论和对人民群众的错误观点等，也都写有专文给以批判。此外，部分曾听过陈寅恪讲课的教工学生，还揭露和批判了他在课堂上散播的资产阶级思想。
    语言学界批判王力等的错误观点
    前些时候，北京大学中国语言文学系，对语言教学和研究工作中的资产阶级观点，进行了揭露和批判。很多批判都集中在高名凯所著的“普通语言学”一书上。大家批判了书中表现的资产阶级观点，并且指出作者大量地贩卖西欧资产阶级语言学者方德里耶斯和格拉蒙等人的货色。王力的资产阶级学术观点也受了批判。四年级学生还印出了两本批判王力资产阶级学术思想的论文集子，共收文章十四篇，约十万字。这些论文有的是批判王力的部分著作（如“中国语法理论”）的，有的是专门批判他的某些错误观点（如在语法体系问题上的错误观点）的，有的是专门批判他的治学态度的。此外，大家还对岑麟、袁家麟、朱德熙、周祖谟和魏建功等的资产阶级学术观点提出了批判。
    最近两期的“中国语文”月刊（1958年第九、十期），连续发表了一些批判资产阶级学术思想的文章。第九期上发表了一篇题为“在语言学界展开对资产阶级学术思想的批判”的社论。社论说，语言学界存在着资产阶级思想的情况是严重的，主要地表现在脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离实际，为数不少的语言工作者只从个人兴趣和个人利益出发进行教学或研究，必须进行彻底的检查和批判。社论还说，过去“中国语文”没有尽到学术批判的责任，现在决定陆续发表批判语言学界资产阶级学术思想的文章。发表在这两期上的这些文章，着重地批判了王力、高名凯、吕叔湘和黎锦熙的资产阶级观点。此外，第十期上还发表了高名凯的一篇自我批判的文章。
