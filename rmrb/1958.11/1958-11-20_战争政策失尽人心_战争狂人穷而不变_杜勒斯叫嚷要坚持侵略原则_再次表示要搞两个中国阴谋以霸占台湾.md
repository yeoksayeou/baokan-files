Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech on the evening of the 18th at the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. conference in Cleveland. In his speech, he admitted that the world is currently in "a veritable whirlwind of changing circumstances." He also emphasized that although the U.S. government must "endeavor to adapt its policies to the inevitability of change," the "basic principles" guiding U.S. policy would remain unchanged.

In his speech, Dulles went to great lengths to defend the "position of strength" and "brinkmanship" policies pursued by the United States. Sources indicate that Dulles felt particularly compelled to deliver such a speech because in the recent U.S. congressional elections, Dulles's foreign policy, which had been widely criticized abroad, was also rejected by voters at home.

Dulles discussed the factors contributing to the "constantly changing world." In this regard, he acknowledged that the socialist camp is an important aspect of the "very obvious" forces promoting change. He said that in one generation, the socialist camp has expanded to include countries with a total population of approximately 900 million (about one-third of the world's population). In the Soviet Union, there has emerged an "industrially and scientifically modern nation," and "the United States has indeed recognized the Soviet Union's growing military and economic power."

Dulles said that another important factor influencing the current world development is the national independence movement. He said that the world is currently experiencing a "change from colonialism to independence." "This trend will continue and will bring many new problems." He said that in the eyes of the United States, this trend also presents "new dangers." Dulles advocated that the United States should win over newly independent countries through "aid" and other methods.

Dulles clamored that the West must "resolutely" respond to these "changing challenges" without "accommodation" or "concessions."

Dulles stated that the United States must continue "to maintain a strong military establishment at great expense" as "a primary reliance" for maintaining America's "world order principles." When discussing examples of the United States maintaining these "world order principles," he mentioned the "Truman Doctrine," the war of aggression against Korea, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" for the Middle East, the deployment of troops to Lebanon, and the recent actions of the United States in the Taiwan Strait area. Dulles admitted that when the United States "insists on principles," America's "allies" are "not always happy," and the implementation of this policy "risks war or alienating friends."

At the same time, Dulles also said: "We do not rule out the possibility of reaching agreements with the rulers of China and the Soviet Union on matters of mutual interest to strengthen world order."

When discussing the U.S. policy in the Taiwan Strait area, he once again demonstrated the U.S. government's attempt to create "two Chinas" so that it could occupy Taiwan for a long time. He said that the U.S. government is "trying to get both sides to declare that they will not rely on force to achieve political goals. The government of Free China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek Group) has indicated its willingness to consider it. So far, the Chinese Communists have rejected this concept. However, we will continue our efforts."

After explaining that U.S. foreign policy must adhere to this and that "principle," Dulles said worriedly at the end of his speech that the basic question now is whether the West "can generate the powerful faith and good results necessary to meet the challenges of change." "And many find us wanting. In terms of belief, we seem incapable of formulating for our time a basic philosophy that has a profound, convincing force and a strong appeal. And in terms of work, we seem to treat freedom as an opportunity for moral indulgence, and our productive forces often seem to be used on trivial matters rather than to meet the great needs of humanity." He implored the church council to "spiritually remedy our nation."

    战争政策失尽人心　战争狂人穷而不变
    杜勒斯叫嚷要坚持侵略原则
    再次表示要搞两个中国阴谋以霸占台湾
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯18日晚上在克利夫兰的美国教会全国委员会会议上发表演说。他在演说中承认，当前世界正处在“一个形势发生变动的真正旋风里”。他还强调，尽管美国政府要“设法使它的政策适应于（世界）发生变化的必然性”，然而指导美国政策的“基本原则”仍将不变。
    杜勒斯在演说里竭力为美国奉行的“实力地位”和“战争边缘”政策辩护。有消息指出，杜勒斯特别感到需要发表这样一篇演说，是因为在最近美国国会选举里，在国外受到广泛指责的杜勒斯外交政策在国内也遭到了选民的唾弃。
    杜勒斯在演说里谈到造成“不断变化着的世界”的因素。他在这方面承认，在促进变化的力量的“非常明显”的方面中，社会主义阵营是一个重要方面。他说，在一个世代里，社会主义阵营已经扩大到一共拥有大约九亿人口（约占世界人口三分之一）的国家。在苏联，那里出现了一个“工业上和科学上现代化的国家”，“美国已经的确认识到，苏联日益增长的军事和经济力量”。
    杜勒斯说，影响当前世界发展的另一个重要因素是民族独立运动。他说，目前世界发生了“从殖民主义变为独立的变化”。“这种趋势还将继续下去，并且会带来许多新问题”。他说，在美国看来，这个趋势也产生了“新的危险”。杜勒斯鼓吹美国要通过“援助”等等方法来拉拢新近获得独立的国家。
    杜勒斯叫嚷西方要“坚定不移地”应付这些“变动的挑战”，而不“迁就”和“让步”。
    杜勒斯表示，美国要继续“以巨大的费用来保持一个强大的军事机构”，以此作为维护美国的“世界秩序原则”的“一种主要的依靠”。他在谈到美国维护这种“世界秩序原则”的例证时，提到“杜鲁门主义”、侵略朝鲜的战争、对中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”、出兵黎巴嫩以及美国最近在台湾海峡地区的作为等等。杜勒斯承认，在美国“坚持原则”时，美国的“盟友”“并不总是高兴”的，这种政策的推行是“冒着发生战争或者是疏远朋友的危险的”。
    同时，杜勒斯又说：“我们并不排斥这样一种可能性：在有相互利害关系的方面同中苏统治者达成协议以加强世界秩序。”
    他在谈到美国在台湾海峡地区的政策时，再一次表明了美国政府企图制造“两个中国”以便它长期霸占台湾的阴谋。他说，美国政府正在“设法使双方宣布不依靠武力来达到政治目的。自由中国的政府
  （指蒋介石集团）已经表示愿意加以考虑。到现在为止，中国共产党人拒绝这个概念。可是，我们将继续进行我们的努力”。
    杜勒斯在说明美国外交政策要坚持这一个那一个“原则”以后，在演说的结尾又忧惧地说，现在基本的问题是，西方“能不能产生为对付变化的挑战所必需的有力的信仰和良好的结果”。“而许多人发现我们无所作为。在信念方面，我们似乎没有能力为我们的时代形成一种具有一种深刻的令人信服的力量和强烈的吸引力的基本哲学。而在工作方面，我们似乎把自由作为一种道德上放纵的机会，而我们的生产力量常常看来是用在无聊的事情上面而不是用于满足人类的重大需要”。他祈求教会会议来在“精神上补救我们的国家”。
