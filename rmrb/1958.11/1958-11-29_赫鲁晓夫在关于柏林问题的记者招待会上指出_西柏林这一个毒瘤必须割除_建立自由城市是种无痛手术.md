Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 27th: TASS reported from Moscow on November 27th that Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev held a press conference at the Kremlin on the Berlin issue. The details of the press conference are as follows:

Gromyko: I now declare the press conference open. Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev will speak.

Khrushchev: I asked the Soviet Foreign Minister to introduce these documents to the journalists before publishing the full text of our government's notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, the German Democratic Republic, and the Federal Republic of Germany on the Berlin issue today, so that they can prepare to raise questions they are interested in after reading the Soviet government's notes.

"Pravda" reporter Naumov asked: Why has the Soviet government decided to raise the issue of ending the occupation status of Berlin precisely now? What goals does the Soviet government hope to achieve with the steps proposed to change the situation in West Berlin?

The Unrealistic Attitude of Western Countries is an Obstacle to Signing a German Peace Treaty

Khrushchev: I will try my best to answer this question. You ask why the issue of ending the occupation status of Berlin has arisen, and why it is necessary to resolve this issue precisely now? This is due to the formation of a certain relationship between major powers, or as the newspapers usually say, between the West and the East.

We have taken many steps to ease international tensions, create conditions for eliminating these tensions and establishing normal relations between countries, ensure peaceful coexistence, and resolve disputes by peaceful means to avoid conflicts. We have taken many measures to find ways to solve such a task: to establish a normal state in the world, especially in Europe, to ensure mutual understanding and peace between the countries that fought against fascist Germany. A considerable period of time has passed since the war – more than thirteen years.

The obstacle to signing a German peace treaty, as representatives of Western countries claim and especially as West Germany insists, lies in their unwillingness to acknowledge the reality. The reality is: there are now two Germanys – the Federal Republic of Germany based on private capitalism, and the German Democratic Republic based on socialism and continuously developing and growing stronger in the socialist direction.

If we admit that the reasons often cited by the West are justified, then this situation must be maintained forever. The German Democratic Republic may not be able to motivate Mr. Adenauer and his government to take a socialist direction in state activities. Of course, if this could really be done, then not only the people of the German Democratic Republic, but also many people in West Germany, as well as all progressive mankind, would welcome it, and we Communists would also be very happy about it.

However, it is an illusion to think that Mr. Adenauer and the ruling group in West Germany will agree to this.

On the other hand, some groups in West Germany, including Prime Minister Adenauer and others, to my regret, have also fallen into the illusion that they expect the German Democratic Republic to abandon its socialist system and accept capitalism for some reason. They want to "reunify" Germany on this basis, that is, to annex the German Democratic Republic by the West German monopoly groups, and to establish a unified Germany on the existing social basis of West Germany through this method. They believe that it is only after this that it is possible to conclude a peace treaty. But, is this plan realistic? Of course not! This plan is an illusion, because the working people of the German Democratic Republic will never be willing to abandon their social and political achievements for the sake of exploiters and monopoly capitalists.

So, what should we do?

The West's Use of West Berlin for the Cold War Requires Surgery to Eliminate This Tumor

We must start from such a reality: Berlin is divided and maintains an occupation system. More than thirteen years have passed since the end of the war. I think every normal person will consider this situation abnormal. Therefore, a solution must be found that can eliminate this abnormal situation, because maintaining the occupation system is of no benefit at present. Maintaining this situation will only benefit the party that pursues aggressive goals.

For Western countries, West Berlin is a good place to implement an aggressive policy against the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and other countries in the socialist camp. Due to the policies implemented by Western countries, due to their instigation of revanchist sentiments in West Germany, and the revival of fascist reactionary organizations and reactionary forces there, West Berlin has become a tumor. If this tumor is not eliminated, there will be a danger of leading to very adverse consequences. Therefore, we have decided to perform surgery, that is, to eliminate the occupied status of Berlin, and to create conditions to promote the normalization of relations between the major powers that formerly joined the anti-Hitler alliance. We hope to create a normal situation and normal conditions so that the relations between our countries return to the state they were in when fighting against Hitler's Germany.

We believe that the people of all countries who advocate eliminating the "Cold War", advocate creating normal conditions in the relations between countries, advocate ensuring peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems, and advocate eliminating disputes and frictions between countries will welcome the Soviet proposal on resolving the Berlin issue.

At the same time, we also know clearly that there are some groups who stand on the position of continuing the "Cold War", stand on the position of using West Berlin as a source of disputes in order to incite a hot war, these groups will certainly be worried and oppose our peaceful proposals. However, we believe that such people are a minority in the world.

The vast majority of people hope for world peace, therefore, we hope to get the support of these people.

United Press International reporter Shapiro asked: Is it correct to conclude from the Soviet note that the Soviet Union will not take any measures to change the current order existing in Berlin within six months?

Not Breaking the Existing Order in Berlin within Six Months; Hoping to Establish a Normal Situation Through Consultation

Khrushchev: In my opinion, you have drawn the correct conclusion: within the announced period, that is, within six months, we will not break the situation that has been formed in Berlin, although we consider this situation abnormal. However, even if it is an abnormal situation, we hope to eliminate it through normal channels, that is, through consultation. We do not want to cause some tension in the relations between countries when eliminating abnormal situations. We hope to establish a normal situation through consultation to promote the development of a friendly atmosphere in the relations between countries.

When I talk about this, of course, there is a reservation: we will abide by the norms stipulated by the occupation system during the above-mentioned period, but there is one condition, that is, other countries do not take provocative actions that threaten the cause of peace.

I think this issue has been discussed.

Agence France-Presse reporter Zarnikau asked: Everyone knows that Berlin is the capital of the German Democratic Republic. However, why does the Soviet Union suggest giving West Berlin the status of a demilitarized free city?

Letting West Berlin Become a Demilitarized Free City is a Realistic Attitude that Considers the Actual Situation After the War

Khrushchev: The question is well raised. Indeed, if we start from the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, then everyone understands that Berlin is located on that part of German territory on which the German Democratic Republic was established and is constantly developing. Therefore, the most correct decision should be that West Berlin, which is now actually separated from the German Democratic Republic, should be merged with its eastern part. In this way, Berlin will become a complete city within the scope of the country in which it is located.

Thirteen years have passed since the end of the war and the signing of the Potsdam Agreement. During this period, West Berlin and East Berlin, and the entire German Democratic Republic, have taken different directions in terms of economic development and national system. If liquids with completely different components are mechanically mixed in a container, then in chemical terms, a certain reaction will occur. And we hope that it is best to solve the Berlin issue without causing strong reactions.

We are willing to solve this problem based on the current reality. The best and most realistic way to solve the Berlin issue is to recognize the fact that there are two Germanys, and to recognize that there are different systems in these two countries. Starting from this point, it is best to create conditions for West Berlin to become a free city, so that it has its own government and its own social and national system.

We believe that in the current situation, only by adopting such a realistic attitude can we find the correct way to solve the Berlin issue and painlessly remove the tumor of West Berlin. We hope to create normal conditions to solve this problem, so that residents with various views and beliefs living in West Berlin will not be forced to accept a system they do not like against their will.

The Lofty Stance Taken by the German Democratic Republic is Conducive to Peace and Solving the German Question

We give high praise to the position taken by the German Democratic Republic. The government of the German Democratic Republic correctly understood our proposals and supported these proposals. We give high praise to this position because this position proves that the government of the German Democratic Republic deeply understands the interests of consolidating peace and unifying its own country. In order to ensure peace and solve the German question, the government of the German Democratic Republic supports this measure for West Berlin. It hopes that this step will also be a good precedent for solving other disputes. I think that anyone who defends the interests of peace will correctly understand and agree with this measure. This measure will help solve the issue of signing a German peace treaty and the issue of establishing contact between the two Germanys – the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

TASS reporter Gerasimov asked: Western newspapers insist that the measures proposed by the Soviet government to eliminate the remnants of the Berlin occupation system will worsen the economic situation of the city and its residents. Is this statement based on any facts?

Due to the Guarantees Put Forward by the Soviet Government, West Berlin Residents Can Improve Their Living Standards

Khrushchev: In my opinion, our proposal answers this question. We say that Soviet orders will guarantee the full operation of West Berlin industrial enterprises. The Soviet Union also promises to guarantee the full supply of food to West Berlin residents. Of course, we propose that all this be carried out on a commercial basis. I think no one will doubt the conditions possessed by the Soviet Union. West Berlin workers and factory owners can carry out activities that are beneficial to West Berlin residents. Doing so will not only not reduce living standards, but will also guarantee residents better employment opportunities and create conditions for improving living standards.

Therefore, if anyone has doubts or unease about this issue, then it should be said that such doubts and unease are completely unfounded.

"Izvestia" reporter Kudryavtsev asked: How should we evaluate the statements made by certain political figures in the Federal Republic of Germany who advocate maintaining the status quo in Berlin?

Khrushchev: I think I have answered this question in part. Those political figures and government officials who insist on maintaining the old situation in Berlin also insist on maintaining the current abnormal situation in Europe and the world. International relations are very tense now. Insisting on maintaining the source of this tension means not eliminating international tension, but making it exist forever. All tensions will cause more serious tension. Considering the level of development of modern weapons, it can be seen that this tension will cause quite tragic consequences for mankind.

Therefore, we must eliminate the source of tension and create normal conditions so that people can sleep soundly and will not be threatened by the outbreak of a new war. If a new war breaks out, atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons will sound. People will ask, are those who insist on maintaining the abnormal situation normal? It is reasonable to ask this question.

Reuters reporter Buist asked: What guarantees does the Soviet government provide for West Berlin as a free city? If West Germany abandons its plans for rearmament, will the Soviet government's policy on the Berlin issue change?

The Soviet Government Guarantees to Make Every Effort to Ensure that West Berlin's Internal Affairs are Free from Interference

Khrushchev: The Soviet government's statement and all our documents provide full guarantees in this regard. We will make every effort to safeguard and maintain this free city, and ensure that its internal affairs are free from interference, so that it can develop according to the wishes of its residents.

We agree if other countries also recognize this situation, or agree to sign a joint document, and fix this document with a United Nations resolution if necessary.

You asked, if West Germany abandons its plans for rearmament, will the Soviet government's policy on the Berlin issue change? No, it will not change. It should be noted that according to the Potsdam Agreement, Germany should not be armed. Therefore, the abandonment of rearmament plans by West Germany cannot be seen as a concession to a concession. These are different things and cannot be equated. If West Germany declares that it will not carry out armaments, but at the same time maintains the occupation system in Berlin, then the source of tension and conflict has not been eliminated, but still exists. Therefore, this abnormal situation must be eliminated. If West Germany does not carry out armaments, that is very wise. If other countries with armed forces in East and West Germany withdraw their troops, as we have repeatedly stated, that would be even wiser. Eliminating the Berlin occupation system and making West Berlin a free city will help solve the problem of withdrawing troops from Germany, and will also help solve the problem of disarmament.

German News Agency reporter Leonhard asked: In your opinion, what steps and measures are most appropriate to make the change in the status of Berlin happen normally and without difficulty?

Khrushchev: We hope to implement these measures without encountering difficulties. It would be wisest if the countries that received our proposals answered that they welcomed the proposals and expressed their willingness to meet and sign the corresponding documents if necessary. I am sure that this position will be approved by everyone who advocates safeguarding world peace. We do not expect a welcome, but we firmly believe that our proposals will be correctly evaluated and accepted as proposals that conform to the interests of peace and the security of all peoples.

The Berlin issue has a long-term nature, so we proposed a six-month period so that we can consider various issues well and comprehensively during this period, thoroughly solve the problem, and eliminate this dangerous source.

If Western Countries Do Not Accept the Soviet Proposals, the Soviet Union Will Also Implement the Proposals

Hungarian News Agency, "People's Freedom Daily" and Hungarian Radio reporters Kulicsar, Kish, and Szabo asked: If the Western countries do not agree to the status of a free city in West Berlin, what measures does the Soviet government intend to take?

Khrushchev: If the relevant governments and the governments that received our notes do not agree with our proposals, this will be very unpleasant. However, even if this unpleasant situation occurs, this will not prevent us. After the deadline, we will implement the proposals stated in our documents. As for why we are taking this decision, I will not explain it one by one now, because the reasons have been described in enough detail in the Soviet government's documents.

German News Agency reporter Nilsson-Hitockby asked: What is the Soviet government's attitude if the US government does not accept the proposal to turn West Berlin into a free city, refuses to withdraw its troops from Berlin, and does not agree to hold any negotiations with the government of the German Democratic Republic?

Khrushchev: If the United States does not accept our proposal, we will certainly feel regret. However, I have said that this will not prevent us from realizing our proposal. We have no other way out. When Western countries, namely the United States, Britain, and France, violated the important principle of the demilitarization of Germany in the Potsdam Agreement and armed the Federal Republic of Germany, we protested against this. But they ignored us and continued to revive West German militarism. Therefore, if our proposal regarding West Berlin is not accepted, we will have to take the kind of actions that Western countries have taken. They have thrown aside their obligations under the Potsdam Agreement and other obligations due to the crushing of fascist Germany.

British "Workers' Daily" reporter Russell asked: Considering that there are various espionage agencies and radio stations in West Berlin that carry out subversive activities, and these institutions guarantee the jobs of many people, what kind of suggestions does the Soviet government intend to put forward to ensure that these people do not become unemployed? (Laughter)

Khrushchev: It seems that we can only suggest that these people change their careers (laughter), that is, stop spreading rumors and engaging in espionage, and engage in labor that benefits the people. If some of them are still unemployed, I do not express sympathy for them. (Lively atmosphere in the venue)

If West Berlin Residents Wish to Maintain the Status of a Free City, They Will Be Able to Implement the System They Want

French "Le Monde" reporter Tatu asked: Mr. Chairman, you said that West Berlin belongs to the German Democratic Republic. Does this mean that the Soviet government believes that this status of West Berlin is temporary, and in the next stage the Soviet government will propose incorporating West Berlin into the territory of the German Democratic Republic?

Khrushchev: I understand your question, and I can answer this question. That is not the case. We do not consider this a temporary recognition or a temporary sacrifice of the German Democratic Republic. We believe that as long as the residents of the free city of Berlin wish to maintain the status of West Berlin as a free city, they themselves will implement the system they want.

West German "Die Welt" reporter Schewe asked: If West Berlin is given the status of a free city, then, in this case, can a free corridor be opened to this city for West Germany, as was done for the free city of Danzig in those years?

Khrushchev: This is a matter of detail, and it is difficult for me to say at the moment. But I think we must ensure that the free city of Berlin has unobstructed transportation to all directions, east and west. This has already been stipulated in our proposals.

American "New York Times" reporter Frankel asked: The Soviet Union's note to the US government states that if the suggestions described in the document are not acceptable to the US government, then negotiations on the Berlin issue between the former occupying countries will lose any meaning. Can this be understood in this way: if the United States does not agree with the specific suggestions described in the Soviet document, then the Soviet government is not interested in discussing any other suggestions related to the Berlin issue?

Khrushchev: It seems that it depends on what exactly the United States disagrees with. If it rejects the entire issue raised in our document, then negotiations on the Berlin issue will indeed lose any meaning. If it is to clarify and discuss our suggestions, then I think this is completely permissible, even necessary. Therefore, we are not raising the issue in the form of an ultimatum, but proposing a six-month period to fully discuss this issue and to hold talks with representatives of Western countries to discuss the Soviet suggestions, if Western countries are willing to discuss this issue.

If the Two Germanys Reach a Unification Agreement, Berlin Will Become the Capital of a Unified Germany

West German "Süddeutsche Zeitung" reporter Steinmayer asked: It is said that the Soviet proposals on Berlin are for a long term. Does this mean that the period of these proposals is roughly equal to the period of the existence of the two Germanys?

Khrushchev: If the two Germanys reach an agreement to restore unification, then it seems that the question of stopping the existence of the free city will also be resolved. Germany will be reunified, and according to the will of the German people, Berlin will also become the capital of a unified Germany.

American "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Lambert asked: Can the Soviet note be seen as declaring the abolition of the Potsdam Agreement?

Khrushchev: What do you think, is the Potsdam Agreement currently being fulfilled? (Laughter from the audience) Lambert said: Some people think so. (Lively atmosphere in the venue)

Khrushchev: The governments of the United States, Britain, and France have rudely violated the Potsdam Agreement, stopped implementing this agreement, and at the same time they have seized part of this agreement and are trying their best to extend the occupation of Berlin. Other countries that participated in the war against Hitler's Germany believe that Western countries have stopped implementing a series of the most important clauses of the Potsdam Agreement, thus losing the right to remain in Berlin. You know, that's our view.

Soviet Proposals Aim to Ease Tensions and Create Normal Conditions for Peaceful Coexistence and Competition

Khrushchev then asked the reporters: Do you have any more questions to ask? Is there anything else? I hope to be able to satisfy the questions of all the journalists present. I hope that the steps taken by the Soviet government on the Berlin issue are correctly understood by everyone. As has been said, the purpose of this step is to eliminate the source of tension, ensure the easing of world tensions, and create normal conditions for peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition. This is the aspect that is of concern, it provides a vast world to devote oneself to benefiting the people of all countries. The Soviet government also had this purpose in mind when it put forward the proposals on the Berlin issue. I hope you will assist us in this noble cause.

I finished reading US Vice President Nixon's speech in London today. First of all, perhaps I can say that I agree with the last part of his speech, which talks about peaceful competition. This is a rare phenomenon. Nixon said in his speech in London that we must finally turn to economic competition. He said that let our main purpose not be to defeat communism, but to make wealth overcome poverty, health overcome disease, and freedom overcome tyranny.

I welcome this statement. If Mr. Nixon's tone of speech is still like this in the future, and if other politicians in the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany also do so, we will certainly welcome it.

One cannot help but point out the new tone in Mr. Nixon's voice. The last part of his speech did not carry the remnants of fissile material from atomic explosions that threatened the peoples of all countries. We are against the arms race and against new war threats. We advocate peaceful competition on the economic stage. Let us compete on this basis and see who beats whom.

Mr. Nixon expressed his willingness to compete on the peaceful stage, to compare who can guarantee the people a higher standard of living, who can provide the people with better conditions to use cultural wealth, and who can guarantee the people more freedom. He expressed his willingness to compete to see who can guarantee better conditions to "eliminate tyranny." However, we and Mr. Nixon have different understandings of tyranny: what he calls the freedom of the rich to exploit the poor, we consider tyranny; we prohibit exploitation, and the measures we take against exploiters, he considers tyranny. These are completely different understandings.

Despite different interpretations of certain concepts and terms, what is important is that our efforts are for peaceful competition.

Khrushchev finally said to the reporters, thank you for your concern. Goodbye!

    赫鲁晓夫在关于柏林问题的记者招待会上指出
    西柏林这一个毒瘤必须割除  建立自由城市是种无痛手术
    新华社28日讯　塔斯社莫斯科27日电：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫27日在克里姆林宫就柏林问题举行了记者招待会。招待会情况如下：
    葛罗米柯：现在宣布记者招待会开始。由苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫讲话。
    赫鲁晓夫：我曾经请苏联外交部长在公布我国今天就柏林问题致美国、英国、法国、德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国等国政府的照会全文之前，先把这些文件向记者们介绍一下，以便他们在看过苏联政府照会之后能够准备提出他们所感兴趣的问题。
    “真理报”记者瑙莫夫问：为什么苏联政府恰恰在现在决定提出结束柏林占领状态的问题？苏联政府为改变西柏林状况而提出的步骤希望达到什么目的？
    西方国家的不现实态度是签订对德和约的障碍
    赫鲁晓夫：我尽力来回答这个问题。您问为什么产生出结束柏林占领状态的问题，而且为什么恰恰是现在必须解决这个问题？这是由于各大国之间，或者如报纸通常所说的，在西方和东方之间形成了某种关系。
    我们采取过许多步骤，以缓和国际紧张局势，创造消除这种紧张局势和建立各国之间的正常关系的条件，保证和平共处，用和平方法来解决发生的争端，以免引起冲突。我们采取过不少措施，以便找出途径来解决这样一个任务：在全世界、首先是在欧洲建立正常状态，保证同法西斯德国作过战的各国之间的相互谅解及和平。战后已经过去了一段相当长的时间——整整十三年多了。
    签订对德和约的障碍，正像西方国家代表所宣称并且特别为西德所坚持的那样，在于他们不愿意承认现实情况。这个现实情况就是：现在有着两个德国——以私人资本主义为基础的德意志联邦共和国，和以社会主义为基础并循着社会主义方向不断发展、不断壮大的德意志民主共和国。
    如果承认西方常常引证的理由是正当的话，那末就必须把这种状况永远保持下去。德意志民主共和国未必能够鼓动阿登纳先生及其政府在国家活动中采取社会主义方向。当然，如果真能够作到这一点的话，那么，不仅是德意志民主共和国的人民，就是西德的许多人，以及全体进步人类，都将会表示欢迎，而我们共产党人，对这一点也将十分欢迎。
    但是，如果认为阿登纳先生和西德统治集团会同意这一点，那是幻想。
    另一方面，西德的某些集团，使我感到遗憾的是，其中包括阿登纳总理先生和其他人，也陷入了幻想，他们不知为什么竟指望要德意志民主共和国放弃社会主义制度而接受资本主义制度。他们想在这个基础上
  “重新统一”德国，也就是说，由西德垄断集团吞并德意志民主共和国，通过这种方式在西德现有的社会基础上建立统一的德国。他们认为，只有在这以后才有可能缔结和约。但是，难道这种打算是现实的么？当然不是！这种打算是幻想，因为德意志民主共和国的劳动人民永远也不愿意为了剥削者和垄断资本家而放弃他们的社会和政治成果。
    那么，该怎么办呢？
    西方利用西柏林进行冷战应该动手术消除这个毒瘤
    必须从这样的现实出发：柏林被分裂着而且保存着占领制度。战争结束已经十三年多了。我想，每个正常的人都会认为这种情况是不正常的。因此，必须找到一种能消除这种不正常状况的解决办法，因为目前保持占领制度毫无好处。保持这种局面只会对追求侵略目的的一方有利。
    对于西方国家来说，西柏林是对德意志民主共和国、对苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家实行侵略政策的好地方。由于西方国家执行的政策，由于它们在西德煽动复仇主义的情绪，在那里促使法西斯反动组织和反动势力复活，西柏林已经变成了一个毒瘤。如果不消除这个毒瘤，就会有导致十分不良后果的危险。因此，我们决定动外科手术，也就是说，消除柏林的被占领状态，并且创造条件来促使从前加入反希特勒同盟的大国之间关系正常化。我们希望造成一种正常的局面和正常的条件，使我们各国之间的关系恢复到对希特勒德国作战时那样。
    我们相信，主张消灭“冷战”、主张创造各国关系中的正常条件、主张保证不同制度国家和平共处、主张消除各国间的纠纷和磨擦的各国人民都会欢迎苏联关于解决柏林问题的建议。
    同时我们也清楚地知道，有一些集团站在继续进行“冷战”的立场上，站在利用西柏林作为纠纷的策源地以便煽动热战的立场上，这些集团当然要发愁，并且反对我们的和平建议。但是，我们相信，这种人在世界上是少数。
    绝大多数人是希望世界和平的，因此，我们希望得到这些人的支持。
    合众国际社记者夏皮罗问：根据苏联的照会，得出下列结论是否正确：即在半年内苏联不会采取任何措施来改变柏林目前存在的秩序？
    半年内不打破柏林现存秩序  希望通过协商建立正常状况
    赫鲁晓夫：在我看来，您得出了正确的结论：在所宣布的期限内，即在六个月内，我们将不打破柏林已经形成的状况，虽然我们认为这种状况是不正常的。但是，即使是不正常的状况，我们也希望通过正常的途径，即通过协商的途径来加以消除。我们不希望在消除不正常状况时引起国与国之间关系上的某种紧张状态。我们希望通过协商来建立正常的状况，以促进各国关系上友好气氛的发展。
    我谈到这点时，当然是有保留的：我们将在上述期间内遵守占领制度所规定的准则，但是有一个条件，即别的国家不采取威胁和平事业的挑衅行动。
    我觉得，这个问题已经谈完了。
    法新社记者扎尔内考问：大家都知道柏林是德意志民主共和国的首都。但是，为什么苏联却建议给予柏林西部以非军事化的自由城市的地位呢？
    让西柏林成为非军事化自由城市是考虑战后实际情况的现实态度
    赫鲁晓夫：问题提得很对。的确，如果从波茨坦协定的规定出发的话，那么，每个人都明白，柏林位于德意志民主共和国赖以建立并且不断发展的那一部分德国领土上。因此，最正确的决定应该是，现在实际脱离德意志民主共和国的柏林西部应同它的东部合并。这样，柏林就会成为它所在国家范围内的一个完整的城市。
    结束战争和签订波茨坦协定以来，已经过去了十三年。在这个期间，西柏林和东柏林、整个德意志民主共和国，在经济发展和国家制度方面采取了不同的方向。如果把成分完全不同的液体机械地混合在一个容器中，那么用化学术语来说，就要发生一定的反应。而我们希望，最好在不引起强烈反应的基础上解决柏林问题。
    我们愿意根据当前的现实状况来解决这个问题。解决柏林问题的最好的、最现实的办法，就是要承认有两个德国存在这一事实，承认在这两个国家中存着不同的制度。从这一点出发，最好是为柏林西部创造自由城市的条件，使它有自己的政府，有自己的社会和国家制度。
    我们认为，在目前的形势下，只有采取这种现实的态度才能找到解决柏林问题的正确办法和无痛苦地割掉西柏林这个毒瘤。我们希望创造正常的条件来解决这个问题，以便使住在西柏林的具有各种观点和信仰的居民，不致被迫违背自己的意志接受他们所不喜欢的制度。
    民主德国所采取的崇高立场有利于和平和解决德国问题
    我们对德意志民主共和国所采取的立场给予崇高评价，德意志民主共和国政府正确地理解了我们的建议，并且支持这些建议。我们所以对这种立场给予崇高的评价，是因为这种立场证明，德意志民主共和国政府深刻地理解巩固和平和统一自己国家的利益。为了确保和平和解决德国问题，德意志民主共和国政府支持对柏林西部的这种措施，它希望这个步骤对于解决其他争端问题也是一个良好的先例。我认为，凡是捍卫和平利益的人都会正确地理解和赞同这个措施。这个措施会有助于解决签订对德和约问题和两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国——建立接触的问题。
    塔斯社记者格拉西莫夫问：西方报纸硬说，苏联政府就为了消灭柏林占领制度残余所提出的措施会使这个城市及其居民的经济状况恶化。这种说法有没有根据？
    由于苏联政府所提出的保证  西柏林居民能提高生活水平
    赫鲁晓夫：照我看来，我们的建议就回答了这个问题。我们说，苏联的定货将保证西柏林工业企业全部开工。苏联还答应保证给西柏林居民充分供应食品。当然，这一切，我们建议都在商业的基础上进行。苏联具备的条件，我想是任何人都不会怀疑的。西柏林的工人和厂主可以开展对西柏林居民有好处的活动。这样做不但不会降低生活水平，反而将保证居民有更好的就业机会和创造提高生活水平的条件。
    因此，如果有人对这个问题怀疑或者不安，那么应当说这种怀疑和不安是完全没有什么根据的。
    “消息报”记者库德里雅夫采夫问：应当如何估价德意志联邦共和国某些主张维持柏林现状的政界人士的声明？
    赫鲁晓夫：我认为，我已经对这个问题作了部分的答复。那些坚持维持柏林的老局面的政界和政府人士，还坚持维持欧洲和全世界目前的不正常局面。现在国际关系非常紧张。坚持维持引起这种紧张局势的来源，就意味着不要消除国际紧张局势，而使它永远存在。一切紧张关系都会引起更加严重的紧张，如果考虑到现代武器的发展水平的话，就可以看出，这种紧张将会给人类造成相当悲惨的后果。
    因此，必须消除产生紧张局势的根源，创造正常条件来使人们可以高枕无忧，而使人们不会受到爆发新战争的威胁，如果新战争一旦爆发，原子武器和氢武器就会响起来。人们会问，那些坚持维持不正常情况的人是不是正常的呢？这样问是合情合理的。
    路透社记者布伊斯特问：苏联政府对西柏林作为自由城市提供什么保证呢？如果西德放弃重新武装的计划，苏联政府对柏林问题的政策是否会改变？
    苏联政府保证尽一切努力  使西柏林的内政不受干涉
    赫鲁晓夫：苏联政府的声明和我们的一切文件在这方面提供了充分的保证。我们将尽一切努力来维护和保持这个自由城市，保证它的内政不受干涉，从而使它能根据自己居民的愿望得到发展。
    如果其他国家也承认这种状况，或者同意签署一个共同的文件，如果需要的话，把这个文件用联合国的决议固定下来，我们是同意的。
    您问，如果西德放弃自己的重新武装计划，苏联政府对柏林问题的政策是否会改变？不，不会改变。应该注意到，根据波茨坦协定，德国是不应该武装的。因此，不能把西德放弃重新武装计划看作是对让步的让步。这是不同的东西，不能等量齐观。如果西德声明，它不进行武装，但与此同时却保持柏林的占领制度，那么紧张状态和冲突的根源就没有消除，而仍然存在着。因此，必须消除这种不正常的情况。如果西德不进行武装，那是很明智的，如果在东西德国拥有武装部队的其他国家，像我们一再声明的那样，撤退出自己的军队，那就更为明智。消除柏林占领制度和使西柏林成为自由城市将有助于从德国撤军问题的解决，也有助于裁军问题的解决。
    德意志通讯社记者列昂哈德问：您认为，要使改变柏林的地位这件事正常地和毫无困难地实现，采取什么样的步骤和措施最为合适？
    赫鲁晓夫：我们希望执行这些措施时不遇到困难。如果接到我们的建议的国家对这些建议回答说，他们欢迎这些建议，并且表示，如果需要的话，愿意会见，并签订相应的文件，那么，这将是最明智的。我确信，这种立场将得到一切主张保障世界和平的人们的赞同。我们不期待欢迎，但我们坚信，我们的建议将受到正确的评价，并将被作为符合和平和各国人民安全的利益的建议而被接受。
    柏林问题具有长期的性质，所以我们提出六个月期限，以便能在这个期间内很好地和全面地考虑各种问题，彻底解决问题和消除这个危险的根源。
    西方国家不接受苏联建议  苏联也会把建议付诸实施
    匈牙利通讯社、“人民自由报”和匈牙利广播电台记者库理查尔、基什和萨波问：如果西方国家不同意西柏林自由城市的地位，那么苏联政府打算采取什么措施？
    赫鲁晓夫：如果有关的政府和接到我们的照会的政府不同意我们的建议，这将是令人很不愉快的。但是，即使发生了这种令人不愉快的情况，这也阻止不了我们的。期满后，我们将实现在我们的文件中所陈述的建议。至于我们为什么要采取这个决定，我现在不一一地说明，因为理由已在苏联政府的文件中叙述得够详细了。
    德意志新闻社记者尼尔逊—希托克比问：如果美国政府不接受关于把西柏林变成自由城市的建议，并拒绝从柏林撤出自己的军队和不同意同德意志民主共和国政府举行任何谈判时，苏联政府的态度如何？
    赫鲁晓夫：如果美国不接受我们的建议，我们当然会感到遗憾。但是，我已经说过，这不会阻止我们实现自己的建议。我们没有别的出路。当西方国家、也就是美国、英国和法国破坏了波茨坦协定中关于德国非军国主义化的重要原则并武装德意志联邦共和国时，我们曾经对此提出过抗议。但是他们不理会我们并且继续复活西德的军国主义。因此，如果我们关于西柏林的建议不被接受，我们将不得不采取像西方国家所采取的那种行动，它们把自己在波茨坦协定中所承担的义务和由于粉碎法西斯德国所承担的其他义务都抛到一边去了。
    英国“工人日报”记者罗素问：考虑到西柏林有各种进行颠覆活动的间谍机关和电台，这些机构保证了许多人的工作，苏联政府打算提出什么样建议，保证这些人不致失业呢？（笑声）
    赫鲁晓夫：看来只能建议这些人改行了（笑声），就是说不再造谣和从事间谍活动，而从事有利于人民的劳动。如果其中有人仍然失业，我对他们不表示同情。（场内活跃）
    西柏林居民愿保持自由城地位  他们将可以实行所希望的制度
    法国“世界报”记者塔秋问：主席先生，您说，西柏林属于德意志民主共和国，这是否是说，苏联政府认为西柏林的这种地位是暂时的，下一阶段苏联政府将建议把西柏林划入德意志民主共和国的版图？
    赫鲁晓夫：我明白您的问题，我可以回答这一问题。并非如此，我们并不认为这是德意志民主共和国的暂时承认或是暂时牺牲。我们认为，只要柏林自由城市的居民希望保持西柏林作为自由城市的地位，他们自己将实行他们所希望的制度。
    西德“世界报”记者舍韦问：如果给予西柏林自由城市的地位，那么，在这种情况下，是否可以像当年对但泽自由市所做的那样，为西德通往这个城市开辟一条自由走廊？
    赫鲁晓夫：这是细节问题，目前我还很难说。但是我想，一定要保证柏林自由城市向东西各方的交通畅通无阻。我们的建议中已经规定了这一点。
    美国“纽约时报”记者弗伦克尔问：苏联给美国政府的照会中说，如果文件中所叙述的建议为美国政府所不能接受，那么，前占领国就柏林问题进行谈判就失去了任何意义。对这一点能否这样来理解：如果美国不同意苏联文件中所叙述的具体建议，那么，苏联政府就对讨论有关柏林问题的任何其他建议不感兴趣？
    赫鲁晓夫：看来，这取决于美国究竟不同意什么。如果它拒绝我们文件中所提出的整个问题，那么柏林问题的谈判的确失去了任何意义。如果是要求明确和讨论我们的建议，那末，我认为，这是完全容许的，甚至是必要的。因此，我们不是以最后通牒的方式来提出问题，而是提出六个月的期限，来全面讨论这个问题，来同西方国家的代表进行会谈，以便讨论苏联建议，如果西方国家愿意讨论这个问题的话。
    如果两个德国达成统一协议  柏林将成为统一德国的首都
    西德“南德意志报”记者斯坦迈耶问：据说，苏联有关柏林的建议为期很长。这是否意味着，这些建议的时期大致等于两个德国存在的时期？
    赫鲁晓夫：如果两个德国达成恢复统一的协议，那末这样一来，看来关于停止自由城市的存在的问题也就解决。德国将恢复统一，而根据德国人民的意志，柏林也将成为统一德国的首都。
    美国“纽约先驱论坛报”记者兰伯特问：能否把苏联的照会看作是宣布废除波茨坦协定？
    赫鲁晓夫：您怎么看，目前波茨坦协定是在被履行吗？（全场笑声）兰伯特说：有些人这样认为。（全场活跃）
    赫鲁晓夫：美国、英国和法国政府粗暴地破坏了波茨坦协定，停止执行这个协定，同时它们又抓住这个协定的一部分，想尽办法延长占领柏林。参加对希特勒德国作战的其他国家认为，西方国家停止执行波茨坦协定的一系列最重要条款，从而就丧失了留在柏林的权利。你们知道，我们的看法就是这样。
    苏联建议旨在缓和紧张局势  创造和平共处竞赛正常条件
    赫鲁晓夫接着向记者们问道：你们是否还有问题要发问？没有了吗？我希望能够满足在座各位新闻界人士的发问。我希望，苏联政府在柏林问题上所采取的步骤为大家正确地了解。已经说过，这个步骤的目的在于消除紧张局势的策源地，保证缓和世界紧张局势，创造和平共处和和平竞赛的正常条件。这就是使人关心的方面，它提供了广阔的天地去致力于造福各国人民。苏联政府在提出柏林问题的建议时，也正是本着这个目的。我希望你们在这个崇高的事业上协助我们。
    我今天读完了美国副总统尼克松先生在伦敦的讲话。首先，我也许能够说，我同意他的讲话的最后一部分，这一部分谈到和平竞赛。这是罕有的现象。尼克松在伦敦发表谈话时最后说，我们终于必须转向经济竞赛。他说，让我们的主要目的不是打败共产主义，而是要富裕战胜贫困，健康战胜疾病，自由战胜暴政。
    我欢迎这项声明。如果尼克松先生今后讲话的口吻还是这样，如果美国、英国、法国和西德的其他政治家也这样做，我们一定会欢迎的。
    不能不指出尼克松先生的声音中的新音调，他这次讲话的最后一部分没有带着威胁各国人民的原子爆炸的裂变物质的残余。我们反对军备竞赛，反对新战争威胁。我们主张在经济舞台上进行和平竞赛。让我们在这个基础上展开竞赛，看看谁战胜谁。
    尼克松先生表示愿意在和平的舞台上展开竞赛，比一比谁能保证人民有更高的生活水平，谁能给人民提供更好的条件来利用文化财富，谁能保证人民有更多的自由。他表示愿意进行竞赛，比一比谁能保证有更好的条件来“消除暴政”。不过，我们同尼克松先生对暴政有不同的理解：他所说的富人剥削穷人的自由，我们认为是暴政；我们禁止剥削，我们对剥削者采取的措施，他却认为是暴政。这是截然不同的理解。
    尽管对某些概念和术语有不同的解释，然而重要的是，我们的努力是为了进行和平竞赛。
    赫鲁晓夫最后对记者们说，谢谢大家的关心。再见！
