    The sun is sinking in the west, breath is faint, life is precarious, not considering the evening in the morning.
    In "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers," the first section of the first part contains the four sentences: "The sun is sinking in the west, breath is faint, life is precarious, not considering the evening in the morning."
    These four sentences are from Li Mi's essay "Memorial to Chen Qing." Li Mi was a native of the Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdoms period and served as a courtier. After the fall of Shu, Emperor Wu of Jin, Sima Yan, ordered him to take office in the Jin Dynasty. Li Mi submitted a memorial, stating that he had been raised by his grandmother since childhood, and now his grandmother was over ninety years old and seriously ill, so he had to stay home to take care of her and could not obey the order to go out and take office. These four sentences describe his grandmother's health, like the setting sun about to sink, a patient about to breathe his last, life already at a very dangerous, moment-to-moment situation.
    Comrade Mao Zedong used these four sentences to profoundly and vividly describe the capitalist ideological system and social system as having reached a stage of decay and death, beyond recovery.

### 日薄西山，气息奄奄，人命危浅，朝不虑夕。

    日薄西山，气息奄奄，人命危浅，朝不虑夕。
    “毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”，其中第一部分第一节内有“日薄西山，气息奄奄，人命危浅，朝不虑夕。”四句话。
    这四句话出自李密的“陈情表”一文。李密是三国时代的蜀国人，当过尚书郎的官职，蜀亡后，晋武帝司马炎下命令要他在晋朝做官，李密就上了一表，叙述他自幼依靠祖母扶养长大，现在祖母已经九十多岁，又有重病在身，自己要在家照顾。不能从命出去做官。这四句话就是形容他的祖母的健康，好比夕阳即将落山，病人即将断气，生命已经到非常危险、朝不保夕的时刻。
    毛泽东同志用这四句话，深刻而又形象化地形容了资本主义思想体系和社会制度已经到了腐朽死亡的阶段，再也无法挽回了。
