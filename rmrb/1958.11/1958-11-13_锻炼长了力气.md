　　Exercise Increases Strength
　　The Tuanjie People's Commune in Wuli District, Qingzhen County, Guizhou Province, closely integrates with production and actively carries out mass sports activities of various kinds, which has powerfully promoted production. In order to better carry out sports activities, the commune has established a sports association, organized 15 basketball teams, 45 track and field teams, more than 70 tug-of-war teams, and more than 90 weightlifting teams. More than 1,200 people regularly participate in activities. They use rest time to practice weightlifting and tug-of-war; after work, they practice running or weighted running on the road; and they play basketball or organize ball games whenever they have the opportunity. After the widespread development of sports activities, the athletes' physical fitness has been greatly enhanced. For example, commune member Jin Yuncheng could only carry 80 jin of weight before, but through weightlifting exercises, he can now carry 120 jin of weight and says it is not difficult. Commune members who pull the bellows on the blast furnace also feel that their arm strength for pulling the bellows is much greater than before through tug-of-war exercises. Therefore, many commune members say humorously: People are iron, food is steel, and physical exercise is like drinking ginseng soup.

    锻炼长了力气
    贵州省清镇县五里区团结人民公社，紧密结合生产，积极开展群众性的各种各样的体育活动，有力地推动了生产。为了更好地开展体育运动，公社建立起了体育协会，组织了十五个篮球队、四十五个田径队、七十多个拔河队和九十多个举重队，经常参加活动的有一千二百多人。他们利用歇气的时间，练习举重、拔河；收工的时间，在路上练习赛跑或负重赛跑；有机会就玩篮球或组织球赛。体育活动广泛开展后，运动员们的体质都增强了很多。如社员金云成原来只能挑八十斤重的担子，通过举重锻炼，现在挑一百二十斤重的担子还说不费力。在大炉上扯风箱的社员，通过拔河锻炼，也感到扯风箱的手劲比以前大多了。因此，许多社员很有风趣地说：人是铁，饭是钢，体育锻炼好像吃了人参汤。
