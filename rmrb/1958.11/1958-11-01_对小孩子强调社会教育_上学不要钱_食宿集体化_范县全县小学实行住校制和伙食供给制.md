Xinhua News Agency, Fan County, 31st – Shandong's Fan County, based on the communization of the entire county and the implementation of the grain supply system, and following Comrade Liu Shaoqi's instructions on developing primary schools towards student boarding and emphasizing social education for children, has implemented a boarding and food supply system for all school-age children in the county. Food and lodging are collectivized, and schooling is free. Since this type of school was established, everyone is satisfied and happy.

The county originally had 902 primary schools, which have now been merged into 130, with a total of 1,419 classes and more than 65,600 students. All school-age children are enrolled. The primary school mergers are generally based on the production camp of the commune (equivalent to the original agricultural cooperative). After the mergers, the largest primary school has 32 classes and 1,600 students, the smallest has 6 classes and 300 students, and most have around 20 classes and 1,000 students. Each commune has allocated a portion of land specifically for the use of primary schools. These primary schools have spacious classrooms, sufficient student dormitories, kitchens, dining rooms, and complete teaching and cooking equipment. The streets and houses are cleaned thoroughly, giving people a fresh and comfortable feeling.

The implementation of the primary school boarding system meets the needs of the leap-forward development of industry and agriculture and the urgent demands of parents, teachers, and other parties. Since the establishment of public canteens and other welfare organizations in the county's people's communes, women's labor force has been greatly liberated, but female commune members are still partially tied down by household chores and children, which is somewhat contradictory to the current collective production methods of large-scale operations and field camping. The fact that children were not cared for after returning home from school prevented some female commune members from concentrating on production. Students felt that it was also very inconvenient not to eat and live at school, often being late or absent due to long distances or family matters. Teachers felt that the schools were scattered and manpower was dispersed, which affected the quality of teaching. Therefore, the proposal to implement a student boarding system was immediately warmly supported by all parties. Teachers not only publicized it to parents and other commune members but also actively prepared for the school merger and relocation. Students, upon hearing the news, immediately requested that it be implemented as soon as possible. Parents sent their children to school one after another. Many commune members voluntarily vacated their houses for use as school buildings. The masses in Sunzhanglou Village vacated all 127 houses in the village overnight. The masses in Wangzhang Village not only vacated better houses but also cleaned them thoroughly for the students to live in. Commune member Wang Tongkong mobilized his whole family, carrying lanterns to help the Zhang Fengyun family move into their home. Many other commune members also automatically sent beds, tables, benches, teaching equipment, cooking utensils, furniture, etc., to the schools. The camp and company cadres in the commune also provided whatever the schools needed, helping to raise grain and straw. With everyone's joint efforts, the vast majority of primary school students in the county were boarding at school in just over a week.

The primary school boarding system has initially shown its advantages in a short period of time. Children live in a large family, and collectivism and mutual aid and friendship have grown. Older children cover the younger ones with blankets at night, wake them up to urinate, and help them dress and fold their quilts in the morning. Some students who have not prepared quilts temporarily share them with others. Students have ample rest and study time and can take more time to participate in productive labor. Five hundred and eight students at Sunzhanglou Primary School picked 2,000 catties of peanuts in two days of after-school time; Chenzhuang Primary School also picked more than 700 catties of soybeans. Many male students at Yangji Management Area Primary School are learning to cut hair and cook, and female students are learning to sew. At present, the total land area of small farms in primary schools throughout the county is more than 1,400 mu. They have also planted experimental fields and plan to be self-sufficient in vegetables next year. Students eat and live at school, which further prompts teachers to care for and love students and take full responsibility for them. Students generally receive more care and attention than they did at home. Most teachers sleep with students to facilitate their care, and they take care of the students first and then eat themselves when eating. After enrolling in school, all the students are lively and healthy, and they like this new life. Seeing this situation, people who were originally worried about their children boarding at school are now asking to send their children to board. Female commune members have put their minds at ease and are more focused on production. The masses praised: Boarding at school is really good, parents don't have to worry; Someone takes care of eating and sleeping, someone teaches learning and games; Mothers can concentrate on production, and increase production again and again.

### 对小孩子强调社会教育  上学不要钱　食宿集体化  范县全县小学实行住校制和伙食供给制

    对小孩子强调社会教育
    上学不要钱　食宿集体化
    范县全县小学实行住校制和伙食供给制
    新华社范县31日电　山东范县在全县公社化和实行粮食供给制的基础上，按照刘少奇同志关于小学也要向学生住校方面发展，对小孩子要强调社会教育的指示，已经对全县所有学龄儿童实行住校制和伙食供给制，食宿集体化，上学不要钱。这种学校办起之后，人人满意，皆大欢喜。
    这个县原有小学九百零二处，现在已合并为一百三十处，共有一千四百一十九个班、六万五千六百多学生。学龄儿童已全部入学。小学合并，大体以公社的生产营（相当于原来的农业社）为单位，合并后的小学学生最多的有三十二个班、一千六百人，最少的有六个班、三百人，一般都在二十个班、一千人左右。各公社都划出一部分地区专供小学校使用。这些小学都有宽敞的教室，足够的学生宿舍，伙房、餐室、教具、炊具都很齐全。街道、房舍打扫得干干净净，给人一种清新、舒畅的感觉。
    小学实行寄宿制，适应了工农业飞跃发展的需要和家长、教师等各方面的迫切要求。这个县的人民公社自建立公共食堂和其它生活福利组织以后，大大解放了妇女劳动力，但是女社员还有部分家务牵扯和孩子连累，同当前大兵团作战、田间安营扎寨的集体生产方式有一定的矛盾。孩子上学回家后无人照料，使部分女社员不能安心生产。学生感到不在学校里食宿也很不方便，常常因为路远或家庭琐事而迟到或旷课。教师感到学校分散，人力分散，影响到教学的质量。因此，各学校提出实行学生寄宿制后，立即受到各方面的热情支持。教师一面对家长和其它社员进行宣传，一面就积极作好并校迁移的各项准备工作。学生听说后，当场要求尽快实行。家长纷纷送子女入学。许多社员自愿腾出房子作校舍。孙张楼村群众，一夜之间就把全村一百二十七间房子腾出来。王张村的群众不但把较好的房子腾出来，并且收拾得干干净净，让学生们住。社员王同孔全家出动，打着灯笼帮着张凤云一家搬进自己的家。还有很多社员群众自动给学校送床铺、桌凳、教具、炊具、家具等。公社里营连干部也是学校需要什么就给什么，帮助筹粮筹草。在大家共同努力下，仅一周多的时间，全县绝大部分小学生就都在学校里寄宿了。
    小学寄宿制实行没有多久，已初步显示出优越性。儿童生活在一个大家庭内，集体主义和互助友爱精神增长。大些的孩子夜间给小的盖被子，喊醒他们尿尿，早上帮他们穿衣服、叠被子。有的学生一时没有准备好被子，别的学生便和他合伙盖。学生有了充分的休息和学习时间，并且能够拿出更多的时间参加生产劳动。孙张楼小学五百零八名学生，用两天的课余时间就拣花生二千斤；陈庄小学也拣豆粒七百多斤。杨集管理区小学的很多男学生正在学理发、做饭，女学生学做针线活。现在全县各小学小农场土地共有一千四百多亩，他们也种了试验田，打算明年蔬菜全部自给。学生食宿在学校，更加促使教师关心和爱护学生，对学生全面负责。学生们一般都比原来在家里受到了更多的关心和照顾。绝大部分教师为了便于照顾学生，都同学生睡在一起，在吃饭的时候，先照料学生吃过后，自己再吃。学生入学后，个个活泼、健壮，都喜欢这种新的生活。看到这种情形，原来不放心孩子在学校里寄宿的人，现在也要求送孩子来寄宿了。女社员们更放下了一件心事，更安心生产。群众赞美道：学校寄宿真正好，家长不用把心操；吃饭睡觉有人管，学习游戏有人教；妈妈安心去生产，产量提高再提高。
