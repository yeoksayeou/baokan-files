Small Information

    The total cotton output in 1957 (32.8 million dan) was the highest annual output in China's history, but this output was less than half of this year's total output. The cotton yield per unit area in 1957 was 37.9 jin, only a little more than one-third of this year's yield per unit area. Last year, there were only 4.21 million mu of cotton fields with more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and only five counties and cities with an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu: Macheng, Cixi, Shijiazhuang City, Dunhuang, and Guangji. In this regard, last year cannot be compared with this year.

    In Zhejiang, which reached 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year, the average yield per mu in the province last year was more than 73 jin; in Xinjiang and Hubei, which reached 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year, the average yield per mu in the province last year was more than 50 jin; in Shaanxi, Hebei, Gansu and Shanghai, which reached 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year, the average yield per mu in the province (city) last year was more than 40 jin; Jiangsu and Shanxi had an average yield of more than 38 jin per mu in the whole province last year, and Shandong had 30.7 jin. From the above situation, it can be seen that the increase in production of the ten provinces (regions) and cities that reached 100 jin of ginned cotton this year is different.

    去年的棉花产量
    1957年的棉花总产量（三千二百八十万担）是我国历史上最高的年产量，可是这个产量还不到今年总产量的一半。1957年的棉花单位面积产量是三十七点九斤，只有今年单位面积产量的三分之一多。去年亩产皮棉百斤以上的棉田只有四百二十一万亩，平均亩产百斤皮棉县市只有五个：麻城、慈溪、石家庄市、敦煌和广济。在这一方面，去年和今年也是不能相比的。
    今年达到皮棉百斤的浙江，去年全省平均亩产量是七十三斤多；今年达到皮棉百斤的新疆、湖北，去年全省平均亩产量是五十斤以上；今年达到皮棉百斤的陕西、河北、甘肃和上海市，去年全省（市）平均亩产量都在四十斤以上；江苏、山西去年全省平均亩产量是三十八斤多，山东是三十点七斤。从上面这个情况可以看出，今年出现的十个百斤皮棉省（区）、市的增产幅度是不一样的。
