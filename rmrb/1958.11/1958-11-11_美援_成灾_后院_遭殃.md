    "U.S. Aid" Becomes a Disaster, "Backyard" Suffers

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Foreign newspapers acknowledge that the grave economic situation in Latin American countries is caused by the so-called "aid" from the United States to these countries.

    The Klein-Saks mission, active in Chile, under the guise of formulating plans to alleviate inflation, created conditions for U.S. capital to intensify its penetration of Chile and to further subordinate the Chilean economy to U.S. monopolies. Chilean progressive newspapers, in exposing the serious harm of U.S. "aid" to the Chilean economy, pointed out that the Klein-Saks plan has resulted in an army of 250,000 unemployed in Chile. "El Siglo" emphasized that the implementation of this U.S. mission's plan would allow U.S. monopolies to seize Chile's major raw materials, strengthen their control over Chilean industry, and retain feudal remnants in Chilean agriculture.

    News from U.S. newspapers also reflects the serious economic situation in Chile. "Time" magazine, in describing the situation in Chile, wrote that President Ibáñez left his successor, Alessandri, with an army of unemployed, industrial recession, and an external debt of $718 million. The magazine said that about one million people in Chile have no housing.

    The situation in Bolivia is no better. Even U.S. newspapers admit that U.S. "aid" to Bolivia has worsened the Bolivian economic situation.

    Another victim of "U.S. aid" is Guatemala. "El Tiempo" wrote, in describing so-called "U.S. aid," that the most harmful thing of all is the money the U.S. government gives us. No one cherishes this gift, because everyone knows that these gifts are not out of compassion, but to tie us to imperialism.

### “美援”成灾“后院”遭殃

    “美援”成灾“后院”遭殃
    据新华社讯　外国报纸承认，拉丁美洲国家的严重经济情况是由于美国对这些国家的所谓“援助”所造成的。
    曾在智利活动的美国的克莱因—萨克斯使团以制定减轻通货膨胀的计划为名，给美国资本加紧渗入智利和使智利经济进一步从属美国垄断组织创造了条件。智利进步报纸在揭露美国的“援助”对智利经济的严重危害时指出，克莱因—萨克斯计划使智利出现二十五万人的失业大军。“世纪报”强调指出，实现这个美国使团的计划就会使美国垄断组织霸占智利主要的原料，加强它们对智利工业的统治，并且保留智利农业中的封建残余。
    美国报纸的消息也反映了智利的严重经济情况。“时代”杂志在描述智利情况时写道，伊巴?斯总统留给他的接班人亚历山德里的是：失业大军、工业衰退和七亿一千八百万美元的外债。杂志说，智利约有一百万人没有房子住。
    玻利维亚的情况也不见得好。就连美国报纸也承认，美国对玻利维亚的“援助”使玻利维亚的经济情况恶化了。
    “美援”的另一个受害者是危地马拉。“时报”在描述所谓“美援”时写道，为害最大的莫过于美国政府给我们的钱。没有人珍视这种礼物，因为大家都知道，这些礼物不是同情，而是想把我们同帝国主义绑在一起。
