    Deep Emotion of Reluctant Farewell
    Wei Wei
    I came to Korea amidst the songs of triumph. Once again, I saw the people and the landscape of this place. How bright and beautiful the autumn is! This is no longer scorched earth and ashes. This is a thriving land where thousands of hills are draped in red carpets. The red pines, still alive with embedded shrapnel, stand proudly on the high cliffs. In the valleys, whistles cheer, and egrets glide slowly in the rice paddies. On the mountain paths and by the clear waters, girls in colorful dresses, carrying bamboo baskets and water jugs on their heads, return to their homes filled with cosmos. Seeing all this, recalling the plight of the Korean people, I feel boundless excitement and joy!
    However, in these days, as the Volunteer Army is about to part ways with them, a deep sense of parting is tugging at their hearts. They could bear a vast war, they could bear the various hardships of rebuilding their homes, but they cannot bear such heavy parting emotions. The Volunteer Army feels the same. In the eight years away from their motherland, they have always thought of and missed their country, but once they have to leave these people with whom they have forged bonds of life and death, they feel infinitely attached.
    How to express their feelings? What do the soldiers have? They only have a pair of hands calloused with hard work and a sincere heart. In the limited moments before this farewell, I saw them working day and night. As the comrades of the Korean People's Army are about to take over the defense, they scrubbed the barracks again and again. Even if a few specks of mud splashed on the wall, they would scrub it again. Even a water bottle would be polished. To beautify the camp, they were practically the goddess who refined stones to mend the sky in the legend. They climbed from the east mountain to the west mountain, from the north ridge to the south river, collecting red, white, yellow, and green stones, and also digging up the green moss. They inlaid flower borders around each house and built flower beds in each courtyard. Saying flower beds, they are actually colorful paintings embroidered on the ground. There are dragons, phoenixes, lions, and tigers, there are rabbits and colorful butterflies, there are water lilies and snow-covered red plums, and there are even Tiananmen and Mudan Peak surrounded by white clouds. If you look closer, you will see the painstaking efforts of the soldiers: they used flashlight bulbs painted with red paint to make the eyes of the white rabbits; they cut off the bottle mouths and inlaid porcelain bowl pieces to make the flower spots on the butterfly wings; even in the mouthwash pool, they built red suns, roosters, and the greeting "Good Morning." Just as the soldier's poem says, "The garden paths are made of brocade, arranging flowers is like sitting in an embroidered pavilion," every flower and leaf here is permeated with the soldiers' sweat and deep affection!
    In addition, the soldiers also left their most beloved things to the comrades of the People's Army. In every gift room, they revealed their red hearts. Even I, who have been in the army for many years, have never appreciated so many secrets of the soldiers. These gifts are things they have never been willing to use, never show to anyone, always hidden in the innermost layer of their small bags, treasures they have carried over mountains and rivers, and would not give up even at the cost of their lives in water and fire. This time, in order to leave this land, for the most precious friendship, their secrets were revealed. There is a handkerchief made overnight by a lover at parting, an embroidered sock bottom carried since joining the army, a porcelain bowl passed down for generations, an embroidered purse from sisters, a pair of nuptial cups for the wedding night, and a belt knitted with red wool by a fiancée. These beloved objects, even they themselves, only take them out to look at when no one is around, and then quickly hide them again. But today, they took them out and wrote poems on red paper and placed them here. There is a pair of exceptionally exquisite embroidered sock bottoms, with a poem attached:
      Wife makes socks with a thousand stitches, given to me at parting by the river,
      Love is as continuous as the river, forever flowing without end.
      I cherish this sock in my heart, hidden in my bag for four years,
      Now I give it to a comrade to express my feelings, hoping our hearts will always be connected.
    These touching gifts made some other soldiers feel embarrassed. Soldiers Hu Mingfu and two other comrades decided to make embroidered handkerchiefs for the People's Army by hand. They had no cloth, so they tore off the bag skin, and found paint to dye a few bundles of colored thread, adding alkali during dyeing to make it never fade. Thus, the hero who killed enemies picked up the embroidery needle and became an embroidery girl. Embroidering, embroidering, two embroidered handkerchiefs were finally made. They also wrote the following poem:
        Rough hands embroider flowers late at night, stitch by stitch,
        Every stitch is a heart to heart, Sino-Korean friendship is deeper than the sea.
    In this limited moment, the soldiers also thought in many ways to do a little for the local elders. They considered which streams were difficult to pass during mountain floods, and built stone and wooden bridges. They considered which families lived too far from the river, and dug wells near scattered houses. They considered which wells were close to the road, and added well covers to the wells. They also went from house to house to see who's house was leaking rain, and repaired it with new grass, and who's roof terrace had cracks, and smeared it with mortar. They also picked up American bomb fragments, lit a furnace, and forged them into sickles, cut mountain vines to weave baskets, and made small round tables with movable legs in the Korean style, and then distributed them to Korean Abaji and Amani. Some other ingenious soldiers, they also made small toy guns, kaleidoscopes, and small ice sleds for the children, and carved dragon head crutches for the elderly. When these seasoned old people received the crutches in their hands, their dim old eyes welled up with tears. They lamented that they had lived through several eras and had never seen such an army, an army that makes kaleidoscopes and dragon head crutches! They praised that the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong taught well, and the hearts of these Chinese children are simply hearts of gold, hearts of silver, hearts as crystal clear as crystal stones!
    In Riyam-ri, Yangdeok County, I saw soldiers rushing to build a Korean-style house. It turned out that there was a hunchbacked, lonely woman in the village, with four children, who had no house for ten years, and had been living here and there. This house was built for her. With deep love, the soldiers painted the pillars red and drew birds, insects, flowers, and plants under the eaves, and colorful paintings of the two peoples fighting side by side. It was not until the day before departure that they just dried the house and pasted it with white paper. The moving day was very lively. The troops dispatched dozens of soldiers, some carrying pots and bowls, some carrying jars and cans, some carrying wood, some carrying grass bags, some driving pigs, the pigs squeaking, drums beating, forming a long line, lively and bustling, sending the family into their new home. Then, the soldiers held hands, surrounded the house, and danced around the Korean mother. The Korean mother leaned on the shoulders of the soldiers, shedding her tears. At this time, her old mother also rushed from Yangdeok. This white-haired old woman filled a glass of wine and presented it to the political commissar's lips, saying that she had a dream last night. She said that she dreamed of a celestial dragon descending from the sky. The celestial dragon floated leisurely in the air and disappeared, and she heard a burst of music. In the music, an unknown number of Volunteer Army soldiers poured in from all directions, walking towards her daughter, dancing around her daughter, just like the scene of the soldiers dancing around her daughter today. She said that in the dream, her daughter lifted her skirt with both hands, and the Volunteer Army soldiers competed to throw flowers and jewels into her arms. The jewels were also written with "Longevity and Happiness", and the flowers looked very light, but when they fell, each one was heavy, weighing down the skirt. … Affectionate people, what a beautiful eulogy you have made to our army! It is conceivable that people would deeply miss such an army when they had to leave!
    However, the departure date of the Volunteer Army was still approaching day by day, regardless of people's deep parting emotions. The Korean elders, they did not have much interest in doing work during the day, and could not sleep peacefully at night. They repeatedly inquired about the departure date of the Volunteer Army, fearing that people would leave quietly. Whenever they heard the sound of a car, they would push open the doors and windows to look around. If any soldier went to their home, the Amani would bring out a copper bowl of chestnuts, or frantically grab hot eggs from the chicken coop and stuff them into your arms. They also invited familiar soldiers to their homes, killed chickens, bought wine, and watched you eat it into your stomach, as if they could relax their parting emotions. In Wenjing-ri, there were twenty-two old mothers who collected money, prepared wine and food, and invited dozens of soldiers to chat. That night, they poured out their feelings to the Chinese children. Some said that when you leave, it is like I lost an arm. Some said that when you leave, it is like lacking salt when eating. Some said that if I could carry it, Mom would carry you across the Yalu River! With tears in their eyes, they pulled off the silver hairpins on their heads, took off the wedding rings they had worn for decades, and took out the small copper bells they had been wearing for generations when dancing, stuffing them into the soldiers' arms and wearing them on the soldiers' fingers. They also fed the soldiers with mouthfuls of vegetables. Some people swallowed it with tears, some turned their backs and secretly spit out the chestnuts that Amani fed into their mouths, wrapped them in paper, and carefully put them in their pockets as a lifelong remembrance of the Korean mother. The soldiers said excitedly: "If the US imperialism dares to act again, even if I live to be eighty years old and have a three-foot long beard, I will bring my children and grandchildren to resist US aggression and aid Korea!"
    The deep affection of the Korean people is so unforgettable. There was a blind old mother in Wenjing-ri. Since her daughter was snatched away by the Japanese, her eyes have been blinded by the tears of those months and years. When twenty-odd soldiers went to say goodbye to her, the old mother said emotionally: "You have lived here for a few years, and I have never seen what you look like. You helped me repair the house, and I can't see who repaired the house. God, if I could open my eyes and see you, I would be willing to die immediately!" She patted her heart and touched the soldiers' chests: "Children, I can't see you, let me touch you!" After saying that, she touched the twenty-odd soldiers from head to toe.
    In this moment of parting, there is simply no place that is not a poem of friendship, a touching poem. People composed many poems to praise this precious friendship. In the maple forest thatched house in old Yangdeok, lived a white-haired anonymous poet. I went to visit him. Talking about the withdrawal of the Volunteer Army, the old man sighed with great regret, and wrote down a few Chinese characters: "Completely like limbs, all the words of the people." The old man also handed me five or six self-pasted white paper envelopes, all of which were written with: "Park In-jun, an 78-year-old man from Dongyang-ri, Yangdeok County, South Pyongan Province, respectfully presents" The envelopes were opened, and they were all farewell poems for the Volunteer Army. One of them is:
        Returning home a thousand miles, geese cry in the third month of autumn,
        The friendship between the two countries, the blue river flows endlessly.
    Another one is:
        Night frost turns red a thousand forests of trees, which can be used for tomorrow's farewell,
        With white heads and children full under the carts, shouting long live, shaking the mountain city.
    In this moment of parting, the Korean people especially cherish the martyrs who sacrificed on this land. When building the Jiulongjiang Bridge in Dongyang-ri, the flowing wood was often blocked by stones. In order to eliminate the blockage, young Cai Dingqi jumped into the rapids and unfortunately was swept into the vortex and sacrificed. This may be the last person of the Volunteer Army who sacrificed in Korea. After the sacrifice, he was buried in the Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery. However, the people of Dongyang-ri insisted on burying him in Dongyang-ri, and chose the best sunny cemetery, and reburied him according to Korean etiquette. Affectionate people, they want the men, women, and children of Dongyang-ri to be able to see Cai Dingqi's grave when they lift their heads, and also let Cai Dingqi be able to see the Jiulongjiang Bridge he dedicated himself to. The Volunteer Army agreed to this request. On the day of the transfer, all the men and women of Dongyang-ri participated in the funeral. Before the burial, the weather was very good, but during the burial, suddenly a cloud came, and it rained heavily. At this time, a beautiful rainbow appeared in the sky above the cemetery. After the burial was completed, the rainbow gradually disappeared. Afterwards, a mythical explanation spread among the residents of Dongyang-ri, saying that this was the friendship between China and Korea that moved heaven and earth, so such a beautiful rainbow appeared.
    The day of departure finally came, regardless of people's deep parting emotions. Luggage was loaded onto the cars. The carts were harnessed to mules and horses. The cannons were covered with artillery coats. The People's Army sentries had already replaced the sentries at the camp gate. The soldiers swept the courtyard clean for the last time, filled the water tanks, patted the dust off their bodies, and packed their bags.
    That night, how many Korean families did not close their eyes, how many families lit up at three o'clock in the morning, they rearranged the bouquets again, put the gifts in bamboo baskets, and waited for the dawn when the assembly call was about to sound. Dawn, this is the dawn of late autumn, but people have already come out, wearing thin clothes. The old people wore tall black gauze hats. Women carried bamboo baskets on their heads and children on their backs. People all held maple leaves. Even the children on their backs held maple leaves in their small hands. They stood by the road, standing in the chilly morning breeze.
    The troops assembled. The women opened their bamboo baskets, distributing gifts. The children climbed onto the cannons and inserted red leaves into the muzzles. The small jeep was also wrapped into a flower car with countless colorful paper strips and strings of paper flowers. Amani, children, girls, they did these things without crying. The soldiers told them last night not to cry. The Ri (village) cadres also said that in order not to make the Volunteer Army sad, they should not cry. They were very obedient, they really restrained themselves, and did not cry while doing these things.
    The departure signal sounded. The soldiers carried their backpacks, slung their guns, and walked towards the crowd welcoming them on both sides of the road. The sound of "Long live" rang out, the fiery red maple leaves were raised, the children desperately scattered the flower rain of paper scraps, and cheered: "Rongguang—Yisida!" "Rongguang—Yisida!" (Meaning "Glory!") The footsteps of the Volunteer Army moved, people's eyes were moist, but no one could bear it, trying to shout slogans, still not crying.
    However, when the soldiers held the old mother's hand and called out "Amani, goodbye!" I don't know which old mother couldn't bear it, holding the soldier's hand, the first one cried out. Then the girls and children cried out, and then the silent tears and low sobbing of the men. At this time, the soldiers were simply marching in the tearful rain of farewell from the Korean people. This was not just one person crying, this was the entire Korean nation sending off their closest and dearest friends with a red heart!
    A tear of mine could not stop dripping into this rain of tears. Oh, dear and respectable Korean people! In the midst of the raging war, you were so strong! The enemy turned your cities into ruins, and you did not cry; the enemy burned your homes into ashes, and you did not cry; the enemy killed your loved ones, and you did not cry; the enemy tied you to a big tree, burned you, baked you, and you did not cry; you are truly a hard bow that cannot be broken, a diamond that cannot be burned! But today, when your comrades - the Chinese soldiers - are about to leave you, you shed so many tears! It seems to pour out the tears of each of you for a lifetime today! You are such a strong and affectionate people!
    Please stop crying, dear and respectable people! Your tears are flowing so ceaselessly, already soaking your land. I know that you are distressed for the blood of the Chinese soldiers, and grateful for the little work of the Chinese soldiers. Your tears today are the highest evaluation of the Chinese soldiers, and the supreme glory given to the Chinese soldiers! I know that every drop in this rain of tears is not an ordinary tear. One by one, they are pearls of friendship that are worth more than ten thousand gold!
    In this tearful rain of farewell, the Chinese soldiers also shed tears. An hour has passed, and they have not yet walked two li. At this time, in the ranks of the farewell people, I don't know who is shouting: "Don't cry, carry their backpacks for them!" People woke up as if they suddenly woke up, wiped their tears, and went to grab the soldiers' backpacks. The children also snatched them and carried them on their shoulders, and the women held the backpacks they had snatched high on their heads, drifting beside the soldiers. At this time, the team was no longer divided into ranks, no longer divided into military and civilian, no longer divided into men and women, staggered, colorful, supporting each other, talking and crying, crying and walking. What kind of team is this! Maybe this doesn't look like a team, but it is indeed the most powerful team in the world. This is a torrent of friendship with hearts connected and shoulders side by side! This torrent is marching, marching, crossing one water after another, one mountain after another, they are marching in the red maple forest mountains, marching in the socialist East...

    依依惜别的深情
    魏巍
    我在凯歌声里来到了朝鲜。我又看到了这里的人民，这里的山水。多明丽的秋天哪，这里，再也不是焦土和灰烬，这是千万座山冈都披着红毯的旺盛的国土。那满身嵌着弹皮的红松，仍然活着，傲立在高高的山岩上，山谷中汽笛欢腾，白鹭在稻田里缓缓飞翔。在那山径上，碧水边，姑娘们飘着采色长裙，顶着竹篮、水罐，走回开满波斯菊的家园。看到这种种情景，回想起朝鲜人民的遭遇，真叫人说不尽的激动，说不尽的欢欣！
    可是，在这些日子，在志愿军就要跟他们分手的日子，深深的离情却牵着他们的心。他们可以承担一个浩大的战争，可以承担重建家园的种种艰辛，可是却承担不了如此沉重的离情。志愿军也是这样。他们在远离祖国的八年中，时时想着祖国，念着祖国，可是，当他们一旦要离开这结下生死之谊的人民，却是无限地依恋。
    用什么来表达自己的心意呢，战士们又有什么呢，他们只有一双结着硬茧的手，一颗赤诚的心。在这离别以前的有限时刻里，我看见他们在日夜辛忙。人民军的战友们就要接防来了，他们把营房刷了一遍又一遍，就是墙上溅了几个泥点，也要重新刷过，就是一把水壶，也要把它擦亮。为了美化营地，他们简直成了传说中炼石补天的女神。他们从东山爬到西山，从北岭奔到南河，采来了红石、白石、黄石、绿石，还挖来了苔藓的青茸，给每座房舍的四围都镶了花边，给每座院心都修了花坛，说是花坛，实在是一幅幅绣在地上的采画。这里有龙、凤、狮、虎，有白兔、彩蝶，有水中青莲，有雪地红梅，还有白云绕绕的天安门和牡丹峰。如果你走近细看，就更会看出战士们的苦心：他们是用手电泡涂了红漆，做成小白兔的眼睛；把瓶口切下来，镶上花瓷碗片，做成了蝴蝶翅上的花点；就是在那嗽口池里，也砌了红日，雄鸡和“早晨好”的祝辞。正像战士诗里说的，“园地道路作锦绸，摆花好似坐绣楼”，这里的一花一叶，都渗透着战士们的汗水和深情！
    此外，战士们还把最心爱的东西，留赠给人民军的战友，在每一座礼品室里，都袒出了他们的一颗颗红心。就是我这在部队多年的人，也从没有赏识过战士们这末多的机密。这些赠品，都是他们从来不舍得用，从来不拿给人看，一直藏在小包袱的最里层的，都是包藏多年，跟他们跋山涉水，在水里火里就是牺牲生命也不肯丢的。这次，为了离开这块国土，为了最珍贵的友谊，他们的机密泄露了。这里有爱人分手时连夜做成的手帕，有一参军就背着的绣花袜底，有家传几代的瓷碗，有姐妹的绣花荷包，有洞房花烛之夜的合欢杯，还有未婚妻用红毛线织成的腰带。这些爱物，就是他们本人，也只是在没人的时候，才取出来看一下，接着又匆匆藏起，可是，今天他们拿出来了，而且用红纸题了诗句，摆在这里。有一双做得异常精美的绣花袜底，上面附着一首这样的诗：
      妻子做袜千针线，临别赠我在江边，
      爱情绵绵如江水，永远常流水不断。
      此袜爱在我心间，藏在包内整四年，
      转送战友表心意，两心相盼永相连。
    这些动人心弦的赠礼，使得另一些战士们难煞了。战士胡明富等三个同志，决定亲手做绣花手绢给人民军。他们没有布，就扯了包袱皮，又找来颜料，染了几束采线，染时候还放了碱，让它永不褪色。杀敌勇士就这样拿起了绣花针，变成了绣花姑娘。绣呵，绣呵，两条绣花手绢终于绣成了。他们还题了下面的诗：
        粗手绣花夜更深，绣了一针又一针，
        针针线线心相印，中朝友谊比海深。
    在这有限的时刻里，战士们还多方寻思着，为当地的父老们尽一点力。他们思虑着，哪些溪涧在山洪到来时不好通过，就架起一座座石桥和板桥，哪些人家离河太远，就在散居的村舍边，挖下一口口水井，哪些水井靠近大路，又在水井上加了井盖。他们还挨家挨户去看，看谁家的房子漏雨，就缮上新草，谁家的屋台裂了缝，用灰泥把它抹好。他们还拾来美国的炸弹片，生起炉火，打成了镰刀，割下山藤编成筐篮，按照朝鲜式样做成活腿的小圆桌，然后把它分赠给朝鲜的阿爸基和阿妈妮。另一些心精手巧的战士们，他们还为孩子们制作了小手枪、万花筒和滑冰用的小冰车，为年迈的老人雕制了龙头拐杖。当这些饱经沧桑的老人把拐杖接到手里，他们昏花的老眼涌出泪水，他们感慨活过了几个时代，从来没有见过这样的军队，这制作万花筒和龙头拐杖的军队！他们称颂着，中国共产党和毛泽东教导得好，这些中国孩子的心，简直是金子一般的心，银子一般的心，水晶石一般晶莹玲珑的心！
    在阳德郡日岩里，我看见战士们正急急忙忙赶修着一座朝鲜风味的房子。原来村里有一个驼背的孤苦的妇人，带着四个孩子，十年来没有一间住房，在这儿那儿借居着。这房子就是为她修的。战士们怀着深切的爱，把廊柱染成红的，还在飞檐下绘了鸟虫花卉，绘了两国人民并肩作战的采画。直到出发前一天，他们才把房子刚刚烘干，用白纸裱好。搬家时热闹非常。部队出动了好几十名战士，有人端锅碗，有人抱坛罐，有人扛木头，有人背草袋，有人赶小猪，小猪吱吱叫着，锣鼓敲着，排成了一长队，热热闹闹，把这一家送进新居。接着，战士们手拉手，围着房子，围着这位朝鲜妈妈跳起舞来，朝鲜妈妈伏在战士肩上，倾流着自己的眼泪。这时候，她的老母亲也从阳德赶来了。这位头发斑白的老人，斟满一杯酒，捧到政委的唇边，说昨天晚上她做了一个梦。她说她梦见一条天龙从天上下来了。这条天龙在空中悠悠冉冉，消失了，就听见一派乐声。乐声里，从四面八方涌来了不知道多少志愿军，向她的女儿走来，围着她的女儿跳舞，就像今天战士们围着她女儿跳舞的情景一样。她说，在梦境里，她的女儿用双手提起了裙子，志愿军就争着向她的怀里投着鲜花，投着珠宝。那些珠宝上，还写着“寿福”，那些花朵，看来很轻，可是一落下来，每一朵都沉甸甸的，把裙子都坠沉下来。……深情的人民呵，你对我们的军队作了多末美丽的歌颂！可以想见，人们要离开这样的一支军队，怎末会不深深地依恋！
    可是，志愿军的行期，仍然是一天天地迫近了。朝鲜父老们，他们白天做活也淡淡没有情趣，夜里也不能安静睡眠。他们再三探问志愿军的行期，唯恐人们悄悄离开，一听见汽车声响，就要推开门窗来，张望一回。如果哪个战士到了他们家里，阿妈妮们就会端出一铜碗一铜碗的栗子，再不就从鸡窝里慌张地抓出发热的鸡蛋，向你怀里乱塞。他们还把熟识的战士请到家里，杀鸡，买酒，眼看着你吃到肚里，仿佛才能宽舒一下他们的离情。温井里有二十二个老妈妈，他们集了钱，准备酒食，请了几十个战士去谈心，这一夜，她们向中国孩子们倾吐了自己的感情。有的说，你们走了，就像我掉了一扇膀子，有的说，你们走了，就像是吃饭时缺少了盐，有的说，要是背得动，妈妈要把你们背着送过鸭绿江！她们带着泪，把头上的银簪拔下来，把带了几十年的结婚戒指取下来，把传留几代的跳舞时带在身上的小铜铃拿出来，塞向战士的怀里，戴在战士的手指上。她们还把菜一口一口夹到战士们的嘴里，有的人含着热泪咽下去了，有的人背过身去，把阿妈妮喂到嘴里的栗子又悄悄吐出来，用纸包好，小心地放在衣袋里，作为对朝鲜母亲终生不忘的纪念。战士们激动地说：“如果美帝敢再动手，就是我活到八十岁，胡子三尺长，我也要带着儿孙们来抗美援朝！”
    朝鲜人民的深情厚意，就是这样叫人终生难忘。温井里有一个瞎老妈妈，自她的女儿被日本人抢走，她的一双眼睛，就被那年年月月的泪水沤瞎了。当二十几个战士去向她告别的时候，老妈妈动情地说：“你们在这儿住了几年，我也没看见过你们的模样儿，你们帮我修好了房子，我也看不见修房子的是谁。天哪，要是叫我的眼睛睁开，看你们一眼，就是立刻死了我也甘心！”她拍拍自己的心，又摸摸战士们的胸口：“孩子，我看不见你们，让我摸摸你们吧！”说过，她把二十几个战士，从头到脚都摸了一遍。
    在这惜别时刻，简直无一处不是友谊的诗，感人的诗。人们编成许多诗歌来赞颂这珍奇的友谊。在古阳德的枫林柴门中，住着一位满头白发的无名诗翁。我去访问了他。谈到志愿军的撤离，老人异常惋惜地叹了口气，拔笔写下几个汉字：“完似股肱，人民全部之言”。老人还递给我五六个自糊的白纸信封，信封上都写着：“平安南道阳德郡东阳里七十八岁翁朴仁俊谨奉”的字样，打开来，都是赠给志愿军的送行诗章。其中有一首是：
        还乡千里路，雁叫三月秋，
        两国兄弟谊，苍江不尽流。
    还有一首：
        夜霜红深千林树，可作明朝欢送情，
        带白头髫车下满，连呼万岁动山城。
    在这惜别时刻里，朝鲜人民对牺牲在这块国土上的烈士们，尤其怀有深深的感情。在修建东阳里九龙江桥的时候，流送的木头常常被石头堵住，为了排除阻塞，年轻的蔡定琪，奋身跳进急流，不幸被卷进旋涡而牺牲了。这也许是志愿军牺牲在朝鲜的最后一人。牺牲后，就葬埋在志愿军的烈士陵园。可是，东阳里的人民，坚持要把他葬在东阳里，并且选择一块最好的向阳墓地，按朝鲜礼节重新安葬。深情的人民呵，他们要东阳里的男女老幼，抬起头就能望见蔡定琪的坟墓，也让蔡定琪，能够望见他所献身的九龙江桥。志愿军答应了这个请求。移葬那天，东阳里的男男女女都参加了葬仪。下葬前本来是极好的天气，可是在下葬时，忽然间送来了一片乌云，下了一阵大雨，这时候，在墓地上空，现出了一弯美丽非凡的彩虹。下葬完了，采虹又渐渐隐没，事后，在东阳里居民中，流传着一段神话式的解说，说这是中朝友谊感动了天地，所以才出现了这样美丽的彩虹。
    离别的日子，终于不顾人们深重的离情来临了。行李装上了汽车。大车套上了骡马。大炮着好了炮衣。营门上已经换上了人民军的哨兵。战士们最后一次地扫净了院子，挑满了水缸，拍一拍身上的尘土，打好了行囊。
    这一夜，有多少朝鲜人家没有合眼，有多少人家午夜三点就亮起了灯，他们再一次整理好花束，把礼物放进竹篮，坐等着集合号就要响起的拂晓。拂晓，这是深秋的拂晓呵，可是人们已经走出来了，穿着单薄的衣裳走出来了。老人们戴着高高的乌纱帽。妇女们顶着竹篮，背着孩子。人们都拿着枫叶。就是背上的孩子，小手里也拿着枫叶。他们站在大路边，站在寒气袭人的晓风中。
  部队集合了。妇女们打开竹篮，分赠着礼物。孩子们爬上大炮，把红叶插上炮口。小吉普也被无数的彩纸条和成串的纸花缠成了花车。阿妈妮们，孩子们，姑娘们，她们做这些事情的时候，统统没有哭。昨天晚上，战士们就告诉他们说不要哭。里（村）干部们也告诉说，为了不使志愿军难过，让他们不要哭。他们很听话，他们真的制止住了，在做这些事情的时候，统统没有哭。
    出发号响起了。战士们背起背包，挎上了枪，走向夹道欢迎的人群。“万岁”声响起来了，火红的枫叶举起来了，孩子们奋力地撒着纸屑的花雨，欢呼着：“荣光—伊斯达！”“荣光—伊斯达！”（即“光荣啊！”）志愿军的脚步移动了，人们的眼睛潮湿了，但谁也忍着，竭力喊着口号，仍然没有哭。
    可是，当战士们握着老妈妈的手，叫了一声“阿妈妮，再见！”不知道是那个老妈妈忍不住了，捧着战士的手，第一个哭出了声。接着是姑娘们，孩子们哭出声来，然后是那些男人们无声的眼泪，低低的啜泣。这时候，战士们简直是在朝鲜人民送行的泪雨中行进，这不是哪一个人在哭，这是全朝鲜民族在捧着赤心送着他们至亲至爱的友人！
    我的一滴泪，也止不住滴在这千行泪雨中。呵，亲爱的、可敬的朝鲜人民！在纷飞的战火中，你是那样刚强！敌人把你的城镇变成了废墟，你没有哭；敌人把你的家园烧成了灰，你没有哭；敌人杀死了你的亲人，你没有哭；敌人把你绑在大树上，烧你，烤你，你没有哭；你真是一把拉不断的硬弓，一座烧不毁的金刚！可是今天，当你的战友——中国战士们要离开你的时候，你却倾洒了这样多的眼泪！仿佛要把你们每个人一生一世的眼泪，都倾洒在今天！你是多末刚强而又多情多义的人民！
    请收起眼泪吧，亲爱的、可敬的人民！你的泪是这样倾流不止，已经洒湿了你们的国土。我知道，你是为中国战士的鲜血而痛惜，为中国战士的一点点工作而感怀。你今天的泪，是对中国战士的最崇高的评价，是给予中国战士的无上的光荣！我知道，这泪雨中的每一滴，都不是普通的眼泪，一颗，一颗，都是万金难买的友谊的珍珠！
    在这送行的泪雨中，中国战士们也个个垂泪，一小时已经过去了，还没有走出二里路。这时候，在送行人的行列里，不知是谁在喊：“不要哭了，替他们背背包呵！”人们才像忽然醒转过来，擦擦泪，去夺战士们的背包。小孩子也抢过来背在肩上，妇女们把夺过的背包，高高顶在头上，飘行在战士的身边。这时的队伍，已经不分行列，不分军民，不分男女，错错落落，五光十色，互相搀着扶着，边说边哭，边哭边走。这是什么队伍呵！也许这不像队伍吧，可是这确是世界上最强有力的队伍，这是心连着心、肩并着肩的友谊的巨流！这支巨流，行进着，行进着，越过了一道道水，一道道山，他们行进在枫林烧红的山野，行进在社会主义的东方……
