Comrade, you ask why our platoon leader's nickname is "Red Artillery Platoon Leader"? First, he has high awareness, strong politics, both red and expert; second, he fought well in this artillery battle and was awarded a second-class merit; third, ha! The third is interesting, too much to say in a few words.

Comrade, these days, you have seen some artillerymen in floral clothes on our position. These are the young women and wives from the village who have come to participate in the war voluntarily; you didn't see that some time ago, there were also some artillerymen in floral clothes on our position, but they were genuine artillerymen.

When we were ordered to come to the front line, we only brought two sets of military uniforms in order to travel light, and even left the quilts in the rear.

As soon as we arrived at the front, the heavens played tricks, and it rained heavily for more than ten days! We repaired fortifications in the wind and rain, and everything was soaked. We wore wet clothes to work during the day and wet clothes to sleep at night. Many comrades had swollen feet and thick legs, and many comrades caught colds.

Really worrying! What to do? One night, the company was about to hold a branch meeting to study countermeasures, when He Dama, the head of the women's affairs, came in with a few girls and wives, carrying packages of clothes.

It was like sending charcoal in the snow! Everyone was very grateful, but how could we be embarrassed to accept them?

The instructor said to He Dama: "The villagers also get wet when they help us repair fortifications, take them back for the villagers to change." He Dama said: "Now is not like before, who doesn't have three or five sets of clothes? Just leave them!"

The instructor added: "Our comrades are strong..." He was interrupted by He Dama halfway through his words: "Still bragging! Either catching a cold or feet are swollen, what's strong? Look at our feet! (She raised her muddy big bare feet) Soaked for a few days, and not deformed at all, look at yours!"

"A little sickness doesn't matter," the company commander just opened his mouth, and was blocked back by He Dama: "Comrade! Health is the capital of the revolution! Doesn't matter? If you all fall ill, who will fire the artillery?"

He Dama's mouth was even better than the instructor's, and she persuaded the company commander and instructor with three sentences and five sentences. But when we opened the package, another problem arose. In those colorful clothes, a small half were women's cotton tops!

Everyone suggested returning the women's clothes, but He Dama began to criticize: "Are you feudal brains? Or do you look down on women? At this time, is your health more important or your face more important?"

The big hat pressed everyone into silence. As a result, our squad was assigned eight sets of clothes, three of which were women's, including two floral tops and a red padded jacket, but no one wanted them.

The platoon leader couldn't give orders for such a thing, someone suggested drawing lots, so draw them! Ha! What a coincidence! The platoon leader drew that red padded jacket. Everyone said the platoon leader was lucky, but the platoon leader was reluctant to wear it.

"No! No!" said the one who drew the white floral top, "If you don't set an example, we won't wear it either!" The comrade who drew the blue floral top, and the comrade who drew the old lady's green jacket, also launched an attack, and the platoon leader had to put on that brand-new red padded jacket.

Taking off the wet military uniform and putting on dry clothes, my body felt much warmer and more comfortable. We couldn't help but laugh when we looked at each other. But we were all grateful for the kindness of He Dama and the wives.

The laughter was stopped by the lights out bugle, lying on the soft grass mat, we quickly fell asleep. When we woke up the next day, we found that we were all covered with quilts, no wonder we slept so soundly last night! We all guessed that the villagers were afraid we wouldn't want them, so they secretly covered us.

When we got up, we saw that the military uniforms hanging on the rope were all dry. This was a bit strange! It was still raining outside, how could the clothes dry so quickly? Then, we found a large pile of charcoal ash in the corner of the wall, and we all understood.

In this way, we wore military uniforms in the rain to repair fortifications during the day, and changed into civilian clothes to sleep on the grass mat at night. Those comrades in floral clothes, no one dared to go out at first, but after two days they got used to it, and ran out to get food and do errands. Some swaggered onto the artillery bed, and no one laughed.

Only our platoon leader couldn't get over it, and wouldn't put on the red padded jacket until bedtime. The more he was like this, the more everyone joked with him, first calling him "the artillery platoon leader in the red padded jacket", then abbreviated to "Red Padded Jacket Platoon Leader", until his name was at the top of the red list, everyone changed to calling him "Red Artillery Platoon Leader".

    红炮长
    白刃
    同志，你问我们班长为什么外号叫“红炮长”？第一，他觉悟高，政治强，又红又专；第二，他这一次炮战打的好，立了二等功；第三，哈！第三可有意思啦，两言三语说不完。
    同志，这些日子，你在我们阵地上，看到一些穿花衣服的炮手，这是村里的大姑娘小嫂子，自动跑来参战的；你没有看到，前些时候，我们阵地上，也有些穿花衣服的炮手，那却是道地的炮兵。
    我们奉命开来前线的时候，为了轻装，只带了两套军衣，连被子也撂在后方。
    刚到前沿，老天爷捣蛋，暴风雨连下十几天！我们在风雨中修工事，什么都湿透了。白天穿湿衣服干活，夜晚穿湿衣服睡觉。好多同志脚肿腿粗，不少同志伤风感冒。
    真愁人！怎么办呢？有天夜里，连里正想召开支部会研究对策，这时候，妇女主任何大娘，带着几个姑娘嫂子，抱着一包包衣服进来了。
    真是雪中送炭！大家都很感激，可是怎好意思收下呢？
    指导员对何大娘说：“老乡们帮我们修工事，也是干一身湿一身的，拿回去给老乡们替换吧。”何大娘说：“现今不比往前，谁个没有三套五套衣服？快留下吧！”
    指导员又说：“我们同志身体强……”话说了半拉，给何大娘打断：“还吹啦！不是着凉就是脚肿，有什么强的？瞧我们的脚！（她抬起拖泥带水的大光脚）泡了几天，一点也不走样，瞧瞧你们的！”
    “一点小病不要紧，”连长刚开口，又被何大娘堵回去：“同志！身体是革命的本钱！不要紧？都病倒了，叫谁打炮呀？”
    何大娘的嘴，比指导员还会说，三说五说，把连长、指导员给说服了。可是打开包袱一看，问题又来了，在那些五颜六色的衣服里，有一小半是妇女的棉上衣！
    大家主张把女衣服退回去，何大娘又批评开了：“你们是封建脑瓜？还是瞧不起妇女？这种时候，身体要紧还是脸皮要紧？”
    大帽子把大家压得不再吭声。结果我们班分了八套衣服，有三套女的，其中两件花上衣和一件红袄，分给谁谁不要。
    这种事班长不好下命令，有人提意见抓阄，抓就抓吧！哈！真巧！那条红袄叫班长给抓去了。大家都说班长运气，班长可不乐意穿。
    “不行！不行！”抓到白花上衣的说，“你不起模范作用，我们也不穿！”抓到蓝花上衣的，和抓到老大娘的青褂子的同志，也攻了一阵，班长只得换上那件崭新的红袄。
    脱下湿军装，换了干衣服，身上暖和舒坦多了。彼此互相一看，忍不住笑起来。心里可都感念着何大娘和嫂子们的好意。
    笑声被熄灯号吹停了，躺在软软的草铺上，我们很快就呼呼地睡着了。第二天醒来，发觉身上都盖着被子，怪不得夜里睡得那样香！都猜出是老乡怕我们不要，偷偷给盖上的。
    起床一看，晒在绳子上的军衣全干了。这可有点古怪！外面还下着大雨，衣服怎么能干得这样快？跟着，我们发现隔壁墙角有一大堆木炭灰，心里全明白了。
    就这样，白天穿军装在雨中修工事，黑夜换便衣在草铺上睡觉。那些穿花衣服的同志，开头谁也不出门，过两天习惯了，也跑出去打打饭，摊摊公差。有的大摇大摆的上了炮床，也没有人笑话。
    只有我们班长磨不开，不到睡觉不换上红袄。越是这样，大家越跟他开玩笑，起先喊他“穿红袄的炮长”，后来简称“红袄炮长”，直到他名字上了红榜第一名，大家才改喊他“红炮长”。
