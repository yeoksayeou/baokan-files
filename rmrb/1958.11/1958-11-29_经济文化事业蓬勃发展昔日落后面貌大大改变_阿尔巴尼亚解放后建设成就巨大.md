Comprehensive report from our newspaper: November 29th is the 14th anniversary of Albania's liberation. In the fourteen years since liberation, under the leadership of the Labor Party and the government, the Albanian people have made great efforts to build their motherland and have achieved significant successes. Albania has transformed from a backward agricultural country before liberation into an agricultural-industrial country. The significant achievements made by the Albanian people in the past fourteen years in industry, agriculture, and cultural education are reported separately as follows:

    Industry

    Before the Second World War, Albania had virtually no industry. However, the proportion of industrial output in the total industrial and agricultural output has increased from 9.8% in 1938 to 48%. Industrial production in 1958 increased sixteen-fold compared to 1938. Now, Albania's industrial output in twenty-three days is equal to the entire year's industrial output in 1938.

    Currently, Albania's industry is developing rapidly. The industrial output in the first half of this year was greater than the entire year's output in 1952. The production of oil in the first half of this year was 88% more than in the first half of 1952, coal was 24.7% more than in the first half of 1951, and electricity increased by 45% compared to the first half of 1951. By the end of the second five-year (1955-1960) plan, industrial output will grow at an average annual rate of 17.5%. By 1960, industrial output will more than double compared to 1955.

    Agriculture

    Albania has achieved great success in developing agriculture in the fourteen years since liberation.

    By the end of last year, the total agricultural output had increased by 76.6% compared to 1938. The cultivated land area has expanded by 90%, with the irrigated area increasing by 5,400 hectares, more than 2,700 kilometers of canals have been built, and more than 124,000 hectares of land have been improved. Among various crops, the growth rate of cash crops is the fastest. For example, the planting area of cotton has expanded eighty-two times, tobacco seven and a half times, and although sugar beets only began to be planted experimentally after liberation, their planting area now exceeds 550 hectares. In 1960, agricultural output will increase by 76% compared to 1955.

    The level of agricultural mechanization in Albania has also greatly improved. There are now more than 2,700 tractors in the country. Calculated by the number of tractors per thousand hectares, Albania has more tractors than any of its neighbors, including Greece, Yugoslavia, and Turkey.

    The agricultural cooperativization movement is also developing rapidly. Currently, 1,935 agricultural cooperatives have been established throughout Albania, accounting for 75.7% of the country's cultivated land area. Before 1960, the work of agricultural cooperativization will be fully completed in the plains areas. The agricultural cooperativization movement in mountainous areas is also being actively carried out.

    Cultural and Educational Undertakings

    Currently, an average of one in five people in Albania's population of 1.5 million is studying, which completely changes the backward state of education before liberation.

    In 1938, Albania had no universities, only eleven seven-year schools, and only 170 out of 643 primary schools were open. At that time, the total number of students in the country was only more than 55,000.

    After liberation, Albania's people's education cause has developed at a high speed. In the past fourteen years, 417 seven-year schools, 56 middle schools, and 2,275 primary schools have been established throughout the country, and institutions of higher learning that had never existed in Albanian history have been established: universities, agricultural colleges, and teacher training colleges. Now the total number of students in the country reaches 305,000. According to the proposal of the Albanian Labor Party, starting from the new school year this year, practical courses such as manual labor, ironwork, machinery, electrical engineering, automobile and tractor driving, as well as material experiments in various mathematics, physics, and chemistry courses, have been added to the teaching in primary and secondary schools. In addition, the rule that each student participates in fifteen days of compulsory labor each year and two weeks of summer labor in rural areas has also been implemented. The schools in various rural areas have been allocated land by the government for agricultural practice. (Attached picture)

    经济文化事业蓬勃发展昔日落后面貌大大改变
    阿尔巴尼亚解放后建设成就巨大
    本报综合报道　11月29日是阿尔巴尼亚解放十四周年的纪念日。阿尔巴尼亚人民在解放后的十四年中，在劳动党和政府的领导下，为建设自己的祖国进行了巨大的努力，并取得了重大的成就。阿尔巴尼亚已由解放前的落后的农业国变为农业工业国。现将阿尔巴尼亚人民在解放后的十四年中在工、农业和文化教育事业中所取得的重大成就，分别报道如下：
    工业
    在第二次世界大战以前，阿尔巴尼亚根本没有什么工业，但目前工业产量在工农业总产量中所占的比重已由1938年的9.8％，上升到48％。1958年工业生产比1938年增加了十六倍。现在阿尔巴尼亚二十三天的工业产量就等于1938年全年的工业产量。
    目前阿尔巴尼亚的工业正在迅速发展中。今年上半年的工业产量比1952年全年产量还要多。今年上半年生产的石油比1952年上半年多88％，煤比1951年上半年多24.7％，电力比1951年上半年增加45％。到第二个五年（1955—1960）计划末，工业产量每年平均要增长17.5％。到1960年，工业产量将比1955年增加一倍多。
    农业
    阿尔巴尼亚解放十四年来，在发展农业方面获得了很大成就。
    到去年年底，农业总产量比1938年增加了76.6％。耕地面积扩大了90％，其中灌溉面积增加了五千四百公顷，兴修了长达二千七百多公里的水渠，改良了十二万四千多公顷土地。在各种农作物中，经济作物的种植面积的增长率为最快，如：棉花的种植面积扩大了八十二倍，烟草七倍半，甜菜虽然在解放以后才开始试种，但它的种植面积现在已有五百五十多公顷。1960年，农业产量将比1955年增加76％。
    阿尔巴尼亚的农业机械化程度也大大地提高了。全国已经有二千七百多台拖拉机。按每千公顷拥有的拖拉机计算，阿尔巴尼亚的拖拉机已超过了希腊、南斯拉夫和土耳其等任何一个邻国。
    农业合作化运动也在飞速地发展着。现在阿尔巴尼亚全国已经建立了一千九百三十五个农业合作社，共占全国耕地面积的75.7％，1960年以前，农业合作化的工作在平原地区将全部完成。山区的农业合作化运动也在积极地开展中。
    文化教育事业
    现在阿尔巴尼亚全国一百五十万人口中，平均每五个人就有一个在学习，这完全改变了解放前教育事业的落后状态。
    在1938年时，阿尔巴尼亚全国没有一所大学，七年制学校仅有十一所，在六百四十三所小学中只有一百七十所开课。那时，全国学生总共只有五万五千多人。
    解放后，阿尔巴尼亚的人民教育事业以高速度发展着。十四年来，全国建立了四百一十七所七年制学校，五十六所中学和二千二百七十五所小学，并且建立了阿尔巴尼亚历史上未曾有过的高等学校：大学、农学院和师范学院。现在全国学生总数达三十万五千人。根据阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的倡议，从今年的新学年起已经分别在中小学的教学中增添了手工、铁工、机械、电气和汽车、拖拉机驾驶等实用课程，以及数理化各种课程的实物实验教学。此外，还开始实行每个学生每年参加义务劳动十五天和暑期去农村劳动两周的规定。各地农村的学校已经得到政府拨给的土地进行农事习作。（附图片）
