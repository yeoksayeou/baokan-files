    The Road of Philosophy
    Shi Jing
    In the era of the Great Leap Forward, when one day equaled twenty years, China's six hundred million people were experiencing earth-shattering transformations. These real transformations came from ideological transformations, and at the same time, they promoted ideological transformations. The Marxist-Leninist philosophy that inspires people to create and advance has penetrated people's lives and struggles, and has entered people's hearts with a scale and depth never seen in history. It has begun to dominate people's actions, organize people to transform the world, and create enormous happiness for themselves. Marx said that once a theory grips the masses, it becomes a material force. This sentence has begun to become a language that hundreds of millions of people can understand. People were infinitely surprised to discover that the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism was originally the philosophy of the working people themselves. This philosophy attributes the merit of creating the world and creating all culture to labor, and traces all human wisdom, even the birth (source) of human beings themselves, to labor. It tells people that labor can change everything in the world, and it can also change the speed of change. As long as everyone uses their brains and their hands, workers can rely on themselves, instead of relying on any sages, heroes, or divine power, to accomplish things that were previously thought to require a long period of time, even an entire century, in a very short period of time. After a year of hard work under the leadership of the Communist Party, people have expanded the irrigated area by several hundred million mu, exceeding the historical accumulation of water conservancy construction over thousands of years. Thus, people have discovered that their fate can be changed by their own strength, and it can be changed very quickly. At this time, the workers became the masters of the country and society, and also became their own masters. They objectively became the material force for transforming the world, and subjectively they constantly generated and developed the spiritual force, the philosophical force, for transforming the world. The education of reality made those people who had always only known to kowtow to the Dragon King to pray, stand up and shout the heroic words "I am the Dragon King." The new belief will surely reverse and create a newer reality, making the reality develop faster and go further.
    The philosophy of Marxism-Leninism has become the philosophy of hundreds of millions of working people. This does not mean the end of the philosophical road, but rather the beginning of a greater stage of development. People understand that the masses are the masters of history, and they understand that practice is the source of science. They will continuously add new content and new brilliance to these truths on the road of more conscious practice and creating history. People's practice is endless, and the road of philosophy will also be endless. The historical heritage of philosophy is a precious wealth, and the philosophy developed in the practice and struggle of the people in the present era is an even more precious wealth. Those philosophical workers who are unwilling to see new wealth but only willing to stick to the old wealth will eventually lose all wealth and be seen by the masses as having nothing.
    All philosophical workers who are unwilling to leave this glorious philosophy of Marxism-Leninism, participate in the practical struggles of the masses! There, in the heat of the struggle, you will not only be "collecting folk songs"; your depleted thoughts will turn into surging fountains, your sluggish brains will be nourished by the brains of millions of people, and your small wisdom will grow into great wisdom by merging into the ocean of mass wisdom. When you advance the common cause of hundreds of millions of people, you also advance the philosophy you are engaged in.

    哲学的路
    史经
    在一天等于二十年的大跃进时代，我国六亿人民经历着翻天覆地的大变革。这种现实的变革来自思想的变革，同时也推进着思想的变革。鼓舞人们创造和前进的马克思列宁主义哲学以历史上从未见过的规模和深度打入了人们的生活和斗争，打入了人们的心底，开始支配人们的行动，组织人们起来改造世界，为人们自己创造巨大的幸福。马克思说过，理论一旦掌握了群众，就会变成物质的力量。这句话开始成为数亿人民都能理解的语言。人们无限惊喜地发现：马克思列宁主义的哲学原来就是劳动人民自己的哲学。这个哲学把创造世界和创造一切文化的功绩归于劳动，把人类的一切智慧以至人类自身的诞生（来源）都追溯到劳动。它告诉人们劳动可以改变世界上的一切，也可以改变变革的速度。只要大家自己开动脑筋，开动双手，劳动者就可以依靠自己而不是依靠任何圣贤豪杰和神的力量，把过去认为需要很长时期甚至整个世纪才能做到的事情，在很短的时期内做到。经过在共产党领导下一年的苦战，人们把灌溉面积扩大了好几亿亩，超过了几千年兴修水利的历史积累，于是人们发现，自己的命运是可以拿自己的力量来改变的，而且可以改变得很快。这时候，劳动者成了国家社会的主人，也成了自己的主人。他们在客观上成为改造世界的物质力量，主观上也就不断地产生和发展着改造世界的精神力量，哲学力量。现实的教育使那些历来只知道向龙王叩头祈祷的人们挺起胸来，喊出了“我就是龙王”的壮语，新的信念必将反转来创造更新的现实，使现实发展得更快，走得更远。
    马克思列宁主义的哲学变成了亿万劳动人民的哲学，这不是意味着哲学道路的终结，而是意味着一个更伟大的发展阶段的开始。人们懂得了群众是历史的主人，懂得了实践是科学的源泉，就会在更加自觉的实践和创造历史的道路上，使这些真理不断地增加新的内容和新的光采。人们的实践永无止境，哲学的道路也将永无止境。哲学的历史遗产是一种宝贵的财富，现时代人民群众实践斗争中发展了的哲学则是更加宝贵的财富。那些不愿意看见新的财富而只愿意死守着旧的财富的哲学工作者，最后将失去一切财富，被群众看做一无所有的人。
    一切不愿意离开马克思列宁主义这个光辉的哲学的哲学工作者们，参加到群众的实践斗争中去吧！在那里，在火热的斗争中，你将不仅仅是“采风”；你的枯竭的思路将变成汹涌的喷泉，你的迟钝的大脑将由千百万人的大脑所滋润，你的小小的智慧将因汇入群众智慧的海洋而长成巨大的智慧。当你推进了亿万人民的共同事业，你也就推进了你所从事的哲学。
