Public canteens are praised by everyone

    The Public Canteen is My Home
    People's communes are blooming everywhere,
    Household chores are socialized,
    I asked the old woman what she was doing?
    The public canteen is my home.

    公共食堂我当家
    公社遍地开红花，
    家务劳动社会化，
    我问大娘做啥事？
    公共食堂我当家。
