Xinhua News Agency, 29th: TASS, Moscow, 28th: On the 27th, Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Fedorin, handed to Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama a note from the Soviet government regarding the American armed forces using Japanese territory to carry out aggressive activities against the People's Republic of China. This note was in response to the Japanese government's reply of October 2nd to the Soviet government's note of September 16th this year regarding the same issue.

    The Soviet Union said in this note: In its note of September 16th this year, the Soviet government drew the Japanese government's attention to the fact that if the news were true that American armed forces are using Japanese territory for provocative activities against People's China, then Japan would be in a position where it would become a conscious or unconscious accomplice to the American aggression against the People's Republic of China, and this aggression poses a serious threat to peace in the Far East and world peace.

    The note said: "Regrettably, the Japanese Foreign Ministry's reply of October 2, 1958, in effect avoids addressing this important issue. However, according to reports from Japan itself, American aggressive bases in Japan continue to be used to invade China. For example, American troops, military equipment, and ammunition continue to be transported from bases such as Kure, Yokosuka, and Sasebo to Taiwan to reinforce the American garrison. At the same time, some Japanese political figures have also admitted in parliamentary speeches and newspaper articles that Japan, due to its involvement in the aggressive activities in the Taiwan area, is in danger of being drawn into war, which would cause all kinds of serious consequences, first and foremost for Japan itself."

    The Soviet government refuted in the note the claim in the Japanese reply that "the starting point of Japanese foreign policy is to maintain world peace," saying: "Japan's actions are completely inconsistent with the goal of maintaining peace. The United States' use of Japanese territory to carry out aggressive activities against China certainly does not help create conditions for normal, peaceful and good-neighborly relations between countries in the Far East, and the Soviet government believes that every country that truly cares about the fate of peace in the Far East should work to establish such relations."

    In its reply, the Japanese government also shamelessly defended the United States' aggressive actions and slandered the People's Republic of China, saying that "the assertion that the United States' actions in the Taiwan Strait area are aggression is unfounded, because if one considers the actual situation, one can conclude that the current crisis was caused by the use of force by the Communist Chinese army."

### 日本领土继续被美国利用来侵略中国  苏联要日本政府注意严重后果

    日本领土继续被美国利用来侵略中国
    苏联要日本政府注意严重后果
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科28日讯：27日，苏联驻日本大使费德林把苏联政府关于美国武装部队利用日本领土对中华人民共和国进行侵略活动的一份照会交给日本外务相藤山爱一郎，驳复了日本政府在10月2日给苏联政府的复照，这个复照是对今年9月16日苏联政府就同一问题给日本政府的照会的答复。
    苏联在这次照会中说：苏联政府在今年9月16日照会中曾提请日本政府注意，如果美国武装部队在对人民中国进行挑衅活动时利用日本领土的消息属实，那末日本将处于这样一种地位：它会成为美国侵略中华人民共和国的自觉或不自觉的帮凶，而这种侵略造成了对远东和平以及世界和平的严重威胁。
    照会说：“很遗憾，1958年10月2日日本外务省的复照中实际上避而不谈这一重要问题。然而根据来自日本本身的消息，美国在日本的侵略基地还继续被利用来侵略中国。例如，继续把美国军队、军事装备和弹药从吴港、横须贺和佐世保等基地运往台湾，增援美国驻军。同时，日本某些政界人士在议会中和报纸上的言论中也承认，日本由于牵连在台湾地区的侵略活动中，有被卷入战争的危险，这样就会引起种种严重的后果，首先是对日本本身。”
    苏联政府在照会中驳斥了日本复照中所谓“日本外交政策的出发点是维护世界和平”的说法，它说：“日本的行动完全不符合维护和平的目的。美国利用日本领土来进行侵略中国的活动，这当然无助于创造远东国家之间正常的、和平的睦邻关系的条件，而苏联政府认为，每个真正关心远东地区和平命运的国家都应该为建立这种关系而努力。”
    日本政府在复照中还无耻地为美国的侵略行动辩解，并且对中华人民共和国进行诬蔑，说什么“认为美国在台湾海峡地区的行动是侵略这种说法是没有根据的，因为如果考虑一下实际情况就可以得出结论，目前的危机是由于共产党中国军队动武所引起的。”
