Where is the Hejiang Reclamation Area?

	Between the Songhua River and the lower reaches of the Heilongjiang River lies a fertile plain, and this is the Hejiang Reclamation Area. The Hejiang Reclamation Area is another large reclamation area in the Great Northern Wilderness, adjacent to the Mishan Reclamation Area. It includes seven counties in Heilongjiang Province: Jixian, Luobei, Tangyuan, Huachuan, Fujin, Fuyuan, and Yilan, with a total area of approximately 5.8 million hectares (including Jiamusi, Hegang, and Shuangyashan). In 1957, the sown area of state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives here totaled 750,000 hectares, accounting for 13% of the total area.
	The Hejiang Reclamation Area has eleven state-owned farms, cultivating more than 82,000 hectares of fertile land, and producing nearly 70,000 tons of grain and soybeans for the country last year. The world-renowned Sino-Soviet Friendship Farm is located here.

    合江垦区在哪里？
    在松花江和黑龙江下游之间，有一片肥沃的平原，这就是合江垦区。合江垦区是北大荒上与密山垦区相邻的另一大垦区，它包括：黑龙江省的集贤、萝北、汤原、桦川、富锦、抚远、依兰等七县，总面积约五百八十多万公顷（包括佳木斯、鹤岗、双鸭山）。1957年这里的国营农场和农业社的播种面积共七十五万公顷，占总面积的13％。
    合江垦区共有十一个国营农场，它们开垦并耕种着八万二千多公顷肥沃的土地，去年给国家生产出近七万吨粮食和大豆。中外闻名的苏联友谊农场就在这里。
