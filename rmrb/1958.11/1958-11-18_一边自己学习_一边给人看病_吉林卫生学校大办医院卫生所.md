The Jilin Hygiene School closely integrates general labor with professional labor in its work-study program, vigorously running hospitals and popularizing rural clinics. This has further promoted teaching reform and rapidly advanced local medical and health undertakings.

In addition to regular physical labor, the Jilin Hygiene School, starting from March 10th this year, used existing housing and equipment, along with the voluntary labor of all teachers, students, and staff, to build an affiliated hospital. It has 150 simple beds and can handle 250 outpatients daily. The school's two office buildings were allocated as the site for the affiliated hospital. The material costs for construction, totaling over 2,800 yuan, were entirely covered by the income from teachers' and students' physical labor. The entire hospital has 146 doctors, pharmacists, medical assistants, and nurses. Among them, besides eight full-time personnel, doctors are concurrently teachers and third-year (highest grade) students, nurses are second-year students, and school administrative staff concurrently handle hospital administrative affairs.

The school's teachers and students also carried medicine bags to establish seventeen simple rural clinics in the suburbs of Jilin City, and assisted nine newly built enterprise units in the city in establishing clinics. Each clinic is staffed by three to four third-year students from the school as medical assistants and midwives, with teachers providing regular guidance. In addition to engaging in medical and preventive work, students in the clinics also participate in local agricultural labor during the busy farming season and accept the political leadership of the agricultural cooperatives. They eat, live, and work with the cooperative members. In the past six months, the suburban clinics have treated more than 56,000 patients, transferring over a hundred difficult and severe cases back to the affiliated hospital. No medical accidents have occurred.

The establishment of the school's affiliated hospital enables students to live in a medical environment in a planned way from the beginning of their studies. Content that is difficult to understand and remember in the classroom can be quickly understood and remembered through practice. In the past, students had little practical experience during internships in other hospitals, which caused many difficulties when they first entered the workforce. Now, students practice independently in their own school's affiliated hospital and clinics, repeatedly applying the theoretical knowledge they have learned to practice, greatly improving their medical skills.

    一边自己学习　一边给人看病
    吉林卫生学校大办医院卫生所
    本报讯　吉林卫生学校在勤工俭学中把一般劳动和专业劳动紧密结合起来，大办医院，普及农村卫生所，进一步开展了教学改革，也迅速推进了地方医疗卫生事业。
    吉林卫生学校的勤工俭学除坚持经常性的体力劳动外，从今年3月10日开始，利用现有房屋设备和全校师生员工的义务劳动，建成一所附属医院，设有一百五十张简易病床，每天可门诊二百五十人。学校的两座办公大楼拨作了附属医院院址。建院所用的两千八百多元材料费，完全由师生体力劳动收入开支。全院有医生、药剂师、医士、护理人员等一百四十六人，其中除八个专职人员外，医生由教师和三年级（最高年级）学生兼任，护士由二年级学生担任，学校行政人员兼任医院行政事务工作。
    这个学校的师生还背着药包到吉林市的郊区建立了十七个农村简易卫生所，协助市内九个新建企业单位建立了卫生所。每个所由学校派三年级学生三到四人担任医士及助产士，并有教师定期作巡回指导。学生在所内除从事医疗预防工作外，农忙期间都参加当地农业劳动并接受农业社政治领导，和社员同吃同住同劳动，半年以来，郊区卫生所共诊疗五万六千多人次，转回附属医院的疑难及重症病人百人以上，从未发生医疗事故。
    学校附属医院的建立，使学生从入学开始便有计划地生活在医疗环境中，对许多课堂上不易理解和记忆的内容，通过实践能够迅速理解和记忆。过去学生在其他医院实习时很少实际操作，因此在进入工作岗位初期困难很多。现在学生在自己学校的附属医院和卫生所中实习，多半要独立地进行操作，这就把学得的理论知识反复运用到实际中去，大大提高了医疗业务水平。
