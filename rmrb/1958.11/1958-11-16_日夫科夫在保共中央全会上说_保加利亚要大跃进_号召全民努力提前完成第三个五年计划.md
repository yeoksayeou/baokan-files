Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 14th: According to a report by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency on the 13th, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party held an enlarged plenary session in Sofia on the 11th.

Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, made a report at the meeting entitled "Carry out a nationwide movement to strive to complete the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and our tasks." He reiterated that it is necessary to strive to complete the Third Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) in three or four years ahead of schedule. He said: "We want a Great Leap Forward, which, in terms of its results, will be equal to several years of smooth and gradual development.

Zhivkov said: "The question now is not to increase production by a few percent, but to have a leap forward in our country's development, to make the development of our country's productive forces a completely new and higher speed. This speed needs to break through the old work quotas and old working methods. This speed is determined by the nature of our economy, which is the invincible socialist economy, which has growing potential and huge reserves for our country."

Zhivkov pointed out in his report: The slogan put forward by the Tenth Plenary Session of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee on completing the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and strengthening the cooperative economy has been universally welcomed and approved, and has formed a nationwide movement.

Zhivkov said: Striving to complete the Third Five-Year Plan in three or four years will not only enable our economic development to achieve a leap forward, but also enable our leaders at all levels, the entire party, and all the people to be tempered through this movement. He pointed out that through this nationwide movement, we should cultivate collectivism among the masses and raise their communist consciousness.

The enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party unanimously agreed with the Central Political Bureau's assessment of the nationwide movement to strive to complete the Third Five-Year Plan in three or four years and the measures in this regard contained in Zhivkov's report. The plenary session fully believes that this movement will surely be victorious, and calls on workers, collective farmers, experts, and intellectuals to work and struggle actively to complete the Third Five-Year Plan in three or four years.

    日夫科夫在保共中央全会上说
    保加利亚要大跃进
    号召全民努力提前完成第三个五年计划
    新华社索非亚14日电　据保加利亚通讯社13日报道：保加利亚共产党中央委员会11日在索非亚举行了扩大全体会议。
    保共中央第一书记日夫科夫在会上作了题为“开展争取提前完成第三个五年计划的全民运动和我们的任务”的报告。他重申必须争取提前在三、四年内完成第三个五年计划（1958—1962年）。他说：“我们要大跃进，这种跃进就其结果来说，将等于平平稳稳的逐渐发展的好几年。
    日夫科夫说：“现在的问题不是把产量提高百分之几，而是要使我国的发展有一个跃进，使我国生产力的发展有完全新的、更高的速度，这种速度需要冲破旧的工作定额和旧的工作方式方法，这种速度是我国经济的性质所决定的，我国的经济是不可战胜的社会主义经济，是拥有日益增长的潜力和对我国来说拥有巨大后备的经济。”
    日夫科夫在报告中指出：保共中央十月全会提出的关于提前完成第三个五年计划和加强合作社经济的口号，受到了普遍的欢迎和赞同，并形成了一个全民运动。
    日夫科夫说：争取在三、四年内完成第三个五年计划的全民运动不但可以使我们经济发展获得跃进，而且通过这个运动可以使我们各级领导人、全党和全体人民得到锻炼。他指出，通过这个全民运动，应该在人民群众中培养起集体主义精神，提高他们的共产主义觉悟。
    保共中央扩大全体会议一致同意日夫科夫报告中所包含的中央政治局对争取三、四年内完成第三个五年计划的全民运动的估计和这方面的措施。全会完全相信这一运动必然会获得胜利，并且号召工人、集体农民、专家和知识分子积极工作和斗争，争取在三、四年内完成第三个五年计划。
