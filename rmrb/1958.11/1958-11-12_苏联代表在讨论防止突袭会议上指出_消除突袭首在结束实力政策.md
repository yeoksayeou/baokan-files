Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 10th: The ten-nation conference on preventing surprise attacks, attended by both Eastern and Western countries, opened here today.

This is the second meeting currently being held here between socialist and capitalist countries. The other meeting is the one between the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom discussing the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. This meeting has reached a stalemate because the United Kingdom and the United States are desperately trying to evade a cessation of testing.

The countries attending today's opening meeting include the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Albania, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Italy.

The head of the Soviet delegation, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Kuznetsov, in his speech at the meeting, pointed out the positive role played by the Soviet government in convening the meeting and the importance of the meeting adopting measures to prevent one country from launching a surprise attack on another. He said that due to the development of weapons of mass destruction, a new war would cause much greater damage than World War II.

Kuznetsov criticized the "position of strength" and "brinkmanship" policies pursued by Western countries. He said that in order to get rid of the threat of a new war and eliminate the danger of surprise attacks, it is first necessary to end the "position of strength" and "brinkmanship" policies that cause this danger, and resolutely embark on the road of peaceful coexistence among countries. Kuznetsov said that the Soviet Union pursues a peaceful foreign policy, and it has always struggled to prevent new wars and strive for peaceful cooperation between countries with different social systems.

Kuznetsov also emphasized that only with the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and their destruction from the armaments of all countries, only with the abolition of all military bases on foreign territories and a substantial reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces, will it be possible to formulate reliable measures to prevent surprise attacks.

The head of the US delegation, Foster, avoided talking about disarmament and other important issues related to the possibility of surprise attacks in his speech. He said that the representatives attending this meeting are here in an "expert capacity" to discuss "technical issues" related to surprise attacks.

The first closed-door meeting was held on the 11th.

    苏联代表在讨论防止突袭会议上指出
    消除突袭首在结束实力政策
    新华社日内瓦10日电　讨论防止突然袭击的东西方十国会议今天在这里开幕。
    这是社会主义国家和资本主义国家目前在这里举行的第二个会议。另一个会议是苏、美、英三国讨论关于不继续试验核武器的会议，这个会议由于英美拼命想规避停止试验，已经陷入僵局。
    出席今天开幕的会议的国家，有苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚以及美国、英国、法国、加拿大和意大利。
    苏联代表团团长、外交部第一副部长库兹涅佐夫在会上发言时，指出了苏联政府在召开会议方面所起的积极作用和会议通过防止一国对另一国突然袭击的措施的重要意义。他说，由于大规模毁灭性武器的发展，新的大战将造成比第二次世界大战大得多的破坏。
    库兹涅佐夫批评了西方国家推行的“实力地位”和“战争边缘”政策。他说，为了摆脱新战争的威胁，消除突然袭击的危险，首先必须结束造成这种危险的“实力地位”和“战争边缘”政策，必须坚决走上各国和平共处的道路。库兹涅佐夫说，苏联实行的是和平外交政策，它一直是为防止新战争和争取社会制度不同的国家之间的和平合作而奋斗。
    库兹涅佐夫还强调指出，只有在完全禁止原子武器和氢武器并且把它们从各国的军备中销毁，只有撤销在外国领土上的一切军事基地并且大大地裁减常规军备和武装力量，才有可能制订出防止突然袭击的可靠的措施。
    美国代表团团长福斯特在发言中避而不谈同突然袭击的可能性有关的裁军问题和其他重要问题。他说，参加这次会议的代表们是以“专家身份”来讨论有关突然袭击的“技术问题”的。
    第一次秘密会议在11日举行。
