    Steel Leaps Forward: Machines are Bigger and Newer

    Steel
    During the seven years, the Soviet Union's steel production will increase greatly. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, steel production will increase from 55 million tons in 1958 to 86 million to 91 million tons. On a per capita basis, this will increase from 275 kilograms to 404 kilograms. The increase in steel production in the Soviet Union during these seven years will be almost equal to the total steel production of Britain and France in 1957. Compared with this year, iron production will increase by 65% to 77% by 1965, and the per capita amount will increase from 198 kilograms to 311 kilograms.
    By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the production of steel products will reach 65 million to 70 million tons, which is more than twice the current total production of Britain and West Germany. The Soviet machine manufacturing industry provides modern and advanced equipment for steel production. For example, the Novo-Kramatorsk factory is about to produce a huge, fully mechanized and automated hot rolling mill, weighing 25,000 tons. The annual output of this set of machines is almost equal to the total steel output of the entire Russia in 1913. Steel Production (Unit: Million Tons) Iron Production (Unit: Million Tons)

    Machines
    In the next seven years, the total output of the Soviet machine-building industry and metal processing industry will nearly double, while the production of the main departments of the heavy machine-building industry will increase by nearly one and a half times.
    Compared with this year, in 1965, the output of turbines, internal combustion locomotives, and electric locomotives (calculated by power) in the Soviet Union will nearly double, the output of process equipment for the cement industry, foundries, and other economic sectors will increase by 1 to 1.5 times, and the output of rolling equipment will increase by 1.2 times.
    In the coming seven years, the Soviet heavy machine-building industry will begin to produce many machines that it has not produced in the past. Among them are steam turbines with capacities of 200,000, 300,000, 400,000, and 600,000 kilowatts matched with boilers. The boiler used in conjunction with the 600,000-kilowatt steam turbine can produce 1,800 tons of steam per hour. So far, no country in the world has manufactured units with such powerful power.
    The Soviet Union is also preparing to start manufacturing excavators with a bucket capacity of 35 cubic meters. This giant machine can dig up nearly 70 tons of soil at a time. Among the excavators initially manufactured, there is also a high-productivity wheel-type electric shovel used for stripping work during mining.
    Fully mechanized and highly automated rolling mills will be manufactured for the steel industry, and their productivity will be 50% to 100% higher than existing rolling mills.
    A series of new machines will also be manufactured for the coal mining industry to enable underground coal mining to transition from the mechanization of individual production processes to overall mechanization. The draft Seven-Year Plan stipulates that new technologies will be adopted on a larger scale in this industrial sector.

专栏：向共产主义迈进的纲领  苏联的七年计划②

    钢铁突飞猛进　机器又大又新
    钢铁
    七年间，苏联的钢铁产量将有很大的增长。七年计划末，钢产量将由1958年的五千五百万吨增加为八千六百万吨到九千一百万吨，如按人口平均计算，将由二百七十五公斤增加到四百零四公斤。七年中间苏联增产的钢差不多等于1957年英法两国钢产量的总和。和今年比较，到1965年，铁产量将增加65％到77％，按人口平均计算，将由一百九十八公斤增长到三百一十一公斤。
    七年计划末，钢材的产量将达到六千五百万吨到七千万吨，这将比英国和西德目前产量的总和还多一倍。苏联的机器制造业为钢材的生产提供了现代化的先进设备。例如，诺沃克拉玛托尔工厂即将制成一套巨大的全部机械化和自动化的热轧机，它的重量有二万五千吨。这一套机器的年产量几乎等于1913年整个俄国全年的钢材总产量。钢产量（单位：百万吨）铁产量（单位：百万吨）
    机器
    在今后七年内，苏联机器制造工业和金属加工工业的总产量将增加近一倍，而重型机器制造工业的主要部门的生产就将增加近一倍半。
    和今年比较，1965年，苏联的涡轮机、内燃机车和电气机车（按功率计算）将增加近两倍，水泥工业、翻砂和其他经济部门的工艺设备的产量将增加一倍到一倍半，压延设备产量将增加一点二倍。
    在未来的七年中，苏联重型机器制造工业将开始生产许多它过去没有生产过的机器。其中，有同锅炉配在一起的功率分别为二十万、三十万、四十万和六十万瓩的汽轮机。同六十万瓩汽轮机联用的锅炉，每小时可以生产一千八百吨蒸汽。到目前为止，世界上还没有一个国家制造过功率这么强大的机组。
    苏联还准备开始制造铲斗容量达三十五立方公尺的掘土机。这种巨型机器一次可以挖起将近七十吨的泥土。在初次制造的挖掘机中，还有一种采矿时进行剥离工作用的生产率很高的轮式电铲。
    将为钢铁工业制造全部机械化和高度自动化的轧钢机，它的生产率将比现有的轧钢机高半倍到一倍。
    还要为采煤工业制造一系列的新机器，以便使地下采煤工作从个别生产过程的机械化过渡到全盘机械化。七年计划草案规定在这一工业部门中更加大规模地采用新技术。
