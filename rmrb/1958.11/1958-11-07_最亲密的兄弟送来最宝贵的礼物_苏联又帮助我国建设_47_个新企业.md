    The Closest Brother Sends the Most Precious Gift
    The Soviet Union Helps Our Country Build 47 New Enterprises
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Our reporter learned from the State Planning Commission: The Soviet government has recently decided to provide technical assistance to China in the construction and expansion of 47 industrial enterprises. This was stipulated in an agreement signed between Chinese and Soviet representatives in Moscow in August this year. Surveying and design work for these enterprises is underway separately.
    The first batch of 47 industrial enterprises under the Second Five-Year Plan, for which agreements have been signed for Soviet assistance to China, are urgently needed or the latest technological projects for our country's high-speed economic development. They include important metallurgical enterprises, huge water turbine manufacturing plants, hydro-generator manufacturing plants, precision instrument manufacturing plants, power stations, coal mines, oil refineries, chemical plants, wood processing plants, and special metal products plants.
    Due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the assistance of the Soviet Union, China has established a strong industrial base in the First Five-Year Plan. China's design, construction, and equipment manufacturing capabilities have greatly increased. Therefore, the Soviet Union's assistance to China this time is very different from the First Five-Year Plan. In addition to a portion of brand-new technology projects for which the Soviet Union provides complete design or technological design and supplies complete or most of the equipment, most of the remaining projects are surveyed and designed by China itself, with the Soviet Union supplying the main equipment.
    The Soviet government will also send experts to China to help with the equipment installation, adjustment, and commissioning of these enterprises, and will accept Chinese technicians and workers to conduct process research and production technology internships in relevant Soviet enterprises.
    The person who signed the Sino-Soviet agreement in Moscow in August on behalf of the Chinese government was Wang Daohan, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building. When he met with our reporter, he spoke with excitement about the great and sincerely selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to China and the unbreakable brotherly friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Wang Daohan said: We had friendly discussions with representatives of the Soviet government in Moscow. The Soviet people's friendly feelings towards the Chinese people are indescribable. They regard the various achievements of the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward as their own and sincerely wish the Chinese people to build their country into a socialist power with modern industry, agriculture, and science and culture as soon as possible. The Soviet Union is doing everything possible to meet the technical assistance projects proposed by China. In order to help China with construction, the Soviet Union also provides our country with many of the latest designs, product drawings, and other technical data.

    最亲密的兄弟送来最宝贵的礼物
    苏联又帮助我国建设47个新企业
    新华社6日讯　本社记者从国家计划委员会获悉：苏联政府最近又决定在技术上援助中国建设和扩建四十七个工业企业。这是今年8月间中苏两国代表在莫斯科签订的一个协议上规定的。这些企业的勘测、设计工作正在分头进行中。
    已经签订协议的属于第二个五年计划苏联援助中国建设的头一批四十七个工业企业，都是我国国民经济高速度发展中急需的或最新的技术项目，其中包括重要的冶金企业、巨大的水轮机制造厂、水轮发电机制造厂、精密仪表制造厂、发电站、煤矿、炼油厂、化工厂、木材加工厂以及特种金属制品厂等。
    由于在中国共产党的正确领导和在苏联的帮助下，中国在第一个五年计划中已经建立起强大的工业基础，中国工业的设计、施工和设备制造能力有了很大的增长，因而苏联这次援助中国的方式同第一个五年计划有很大不同。除了一部分崭新技术的项目是由苏联提供全套设计或工艺设计，供应全套或大部分设备以外，其余大部分项目都是由中国自己勘测、设计，由苏联供应主要设备。
    苏联政府还将派遣专家到中国帮助这些企业的设备安装、调整和开工生产，并接受中国的技术人员和工人到苏联有关企业进行工艺研究和生产技术实习。
    代表中国政府8月间在莫斯科中苏协议上签字的是第一机械工业部副部长汪道涵。他在接见本社记者的时候，怀着激动的心情畅谈了苏联对中国的伟大的、真诚无私的援助和中苏两国之间的牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊。汪道涵说：我们在莫斯科与苏联政府的代表进行了友好的商谈。苏联人民对中国人民的友好感情是难以形容的，他们把中国人民在大跃进中的各项成就，看成是自己的一样高兴，并且衷心地祝望中国人民早日把自己的国家建设成为一个具有现代工业、农业和科学文化的社会主义强国。苏联对中国提出的技术援助项目都是尽一切可能来满足。为了帮助中国建设，苏联还供应我国许多最新的设计、产品图纸和其他技术资料。
