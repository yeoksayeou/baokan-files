    Night Dash to the Ironworks
    On the night of October 14th, at a little after two o'clock, Chen Yuqing returned home from the Changzhuang Ironworks in Laiwu County. She had just laid down on the bed when she faintly heard rain falling outside the window. Suddenly, she thought of the 14,400+ crucibles and the 100,000+ jin of ore left in the open air. She thought, the crucibles were newly made, and would be ruined if rained on; the ore would be affected if it got wet, influencing the iron and steel battle. Thinking of this, she pushed her one-year-old child to her husband, secretly got out of bed, and, carrying two straw mats, ran towards the ironworks.
    The night was pitch black. The cold wind whistled, and the heavy rain continued. She didn't care about her footing and ran with all her might to the construction site. First, she used the mats to cover the crucibles, then woke up the workers in her shift and together they threw themselves into the battle of protecting the furnaces and rushing to move the ore and coke.
    By the time they had covered the twelve crucible kilns and moved the ore and other materials indoors, the sky was already bright. When the Party Secretary heard that Chen Yuqing had worked through the night in the rain, he advised her to go home and rest. She declined the Party Secretary's advice with a happy heart and immediately joined the battle of iron smelting.

    夜奔铁厂
    10月14日夜里两点多钟，陈玉庆从莱芜县常庄铁厂回到家里，刚刚躺在床上，忽然蒙蒙胧胧地听到窗外下起雨来。她猛的想起了放在露天地里的一万四千四百多个坩埚和十万多斤矿石。她想，坩埚刚做好，一淋就坏，矿石淋湿了就会影响钢铁战役。想到这里，她把刚满一周岁的孩子推给丈夫，偷偷地下地扛起两领席子向铁厂跑去。
    夜，一片墨黑。冷风飒飒，大雨不停。她顾不得脚下，一股劲跑到工地，先用席子把坩埚盖好，又叫醒和她同班的工人们，一起投入了护炉、抢运矿石和焦炭的战斗。
    当他们把十二个坩埚大窑盖好，并且把矿石等物资运到屋里以后，天已经透亮了。党委书记听说陈玉庆冒雨劳动了一夜，劝她回家休息，她却怀着愉快的心情谢绝了党委书记的劝阻，马上参加了炼铁的战斗。
