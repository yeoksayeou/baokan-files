Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 1st: Copenhagen dispatch: At the second day of the 20th Congress of the Danish Communist Party, Liu Lantao, member of the Central Committee and alternate secretary of the Secretariat of the CCP, delivered a congratulatory speech and read out the congratulatory message from the CCP Central Committee. When he delivered his congratulatory speech and read out the congratulatory message, the entire audience burst into warm applause from time to time. After the speech was completed, the entire audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically.

The full text of Liu Lantao's congratulatory speech is as follows:

Dear comrades:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has entrusted me to extend warm congratulations from the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people to your Party's Congress.

China and Denmark are separated by thousands of miles. Despite this, our common belief—Marxism-Leninism—has always closely linked us together.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, with brotherly friendship, care about the struggle of your Party and people.

The Danish Communist Party is the most loyal representative and defender of the interests of the Danish proletariat, the working people, and the Danish nation. Since its establishment, the Danish Communist Party has been fighting under the banner of Marxism-Leninism for the revolutionary cause of the working class through long and arduous struggles. There is no doubt that newborn forces will surely defeat decadent forces, and the victory of the Danish working class's revolutionary cause cannot be stopped by any force.

Socialist Revolution and National Revolution Have Become the Basic Contents of Contemporary Human Life

In the past half century, human life has undergone fundamental changes. The socialist revolution movement and the anti-colonial national revolution movement have become the basic content of human social life in our era. Now the East wind prevails over the West wind, and the overall situation is favorable to the socialist camp and to the peace-loving people of all countries, and unfavorable to imperialism headed by the United States. The doomsday of imperialism is not far away. All imperialist reactionaries cannot escape their historical destiny of inevitable destruction. The fact that American imperialism's pursuit of its policy of aggression and war has turned against its own wishes, arousing increasingly high anger and resistance from the people of the world, is proof of this.

The working class of all countries in the world is facing the great historical task of striving for peace and socialism. In order to realize this task, the communist ranks need rock-solid unity, whether within the domestic scope or the international scope. This unity must be built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism. Precisely because of this, we communists of all countries regard opposing modern revisionism, the most important danger in the current international communist movement, as our sacred duty, and Yugoslav revisionism is precisely the concentrated expression of modern revisionism. Therefore, we communists of all countries cannot but wage an irreconcilable struggle against the Yugoslav modern revisionists.

South Revisionists Degenerate into Traitors of the Working Class

Communists of All Countries Have No Common Language with Them

The Yugoslav modern revisionists have betrayed all the most fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, resolutely resisted the Moscow Declaration unanimously accepted by the Communist Parties of all countries, and degenerated into traitors of the working class. At a time when the general crisis of capitalism is deepening and the paralyzing effect of the right-wing social democrats' reformism on the working class and the working people is weakening, they put forward a thorough revisionist program to help imperialism disarm the working class ideologically. This program vigorously defends monopoly capital, confuses the fundamental difference between capitalism and socialism, advocates the reactionary idea of capitalism peacefully growing into socialism, beautifies bourgeois dictatorship and uglifies proletarian dictatorship, equates the socialist camp and the imperialist camp, two fundamentally different world political and economic systems, openly vilifies the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, cancels the leading role of the Communist Party and opposes Lenin's theory of party building, replaces the principle of proletarian internationalism with bourgeois nationalism, and replaces dialectics with sophistry, and so on. It is very obvious that this program is precisely adapting to the needs of imperialism, especially American imperialism, and is put forward in order to undermine and split the unity of the international communist movement. Therefore, can it still be thought that there is any common ideological and political basis and common language of Marxism-Leninism between us communists of all countries and the Yugoslav modern revisionists?

Marxism-Leninism has always developed in the struggle against all opportunism. In undermining the international communist movement, in opposing the socialist system, and in embellishing and protecting imperialism, the Yugoslav revisionists have played a role that the right-wing social democrats could not play. They have acted as negative teachers for the communists of all countries. We Chinese communists, like communists of all countries, are very pleased that in the struggle to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism and against Yugoslav modern revisionism, all Marxist-Leninist parties have taken a consistent stand, and the unity of our communist ranks has therefore been further strengthened and consolidated. The economies and cultures of the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are developing rapidly at a speed unmatched by the capitalist world.

Comrades! At present, China, under the illumination of the general line of building socialism, has witnessed a new situation of a great leap forward in production and construction. This situation will surely be conducive to world peace and socialism, and will be warmly supported by the people of all countries. We will never betray the ardent hopes and various supports of the people of all countries for our revolution and construction. Let me congratulate the 20th Congress of the Danish Communist Party, which holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, on its complete success!

The Brotherly Parties and People of China and Denmark Care for Each Other

We Congratulate the Danish Communist Party on Achieving New and Greater Achievements

Finally, please allow me to read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Congress.

The full text of the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is as follows:

To all the representatives of the 20th Congress of the Danish Communist party, Comrades:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the entire membership of the Communist Party of China and the entire Chinese people, extends warm, fraternal greetings to the 20th Congress of the Danish Communist Party, and through the congress to the entire membership of the Danish Communist Party and the Danish working people.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have always been concerned with and sympathetic to the struggle waged by the Danish Communist Party and the Danish people to defend national independence, strive for democracy and social progress, safeguard European collective security and world peace, just as the Danish Communist Party and the Danish people have always been concerned with and sympathetic to our struggle. Recently, our people's struggle against the expansion of American aggression in the Taiwan Straits region has received the sympathy and support of the Danish people, and we hereby express our heartfelt thanks.

We wish the Danish Communist Party new and greater achievements in consolidating its ranks, defending the Party's Marxist-Leninist unity, and strengthening the domestic and international solidarity of the working class.

We wish the Danish Communist Party new victories in the struggle to safeguard European and world peace and to defend the democratic and progressive cause of Denmark!

We wish the Danish Communist Party Congress complete success!

					The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, October 28, 1958

    刘澜涛代表中共中央向丹共代表大会致祝词
    各国兄弟党一致反对修正主义
    共产主义队伍的团结更加增强
    新华社柏林1日电　哥本哈根消息：在丹麦共产党第二十次代表大会第二天的会议上，中共中央委员、书记处候补书记刘澜涛致了祝词，并且宣读了中共中央的贺电。在他致祝词和宣读贺电时，全场不时发出热烈的掌声。致词完毕后，全场起立热烈鼓掌。
    刘澜涛的祝词全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会委托我，向你们党的代表大会表示中国共产党和中国人民的热烈祝贺。
    中国和丹麦，远隔千万里。虽然如此，我们的共同信仰——马克思列宁主义，从来就把我们紧密地联系在一起。
    中国共产党和中国人民怀着兄弟般的情谊，关怀着你们的党和人民的斗争。
    丹麦共产党是丹麦无产阶级、劳动人民和丹麦民族利益的最忠实的代表者和捍卫者。丹麦共产党从成立以来，就在马克思列宁主义旗帜下，为工人阶级的革命事业，进行了长期的艰苦的斗争。毫无疑问，新生力量一定战胜腐朽力量，丹麦工人阶级革命事业的胜利是任何力量所不能阻挡的。
    社会主义革命和民族革命运动已成为当代人类生活基本内容
    最近半个世纪，人类生活已经发生了根本变化。社会主义革命运动和反殖民主义的民族革命运动已经成为我们这个时代人类社会生活的基本内容。现在是东风压倒西风，整个形势有利于社会主义阵营、有利于爱好和平的各国人民，而不利于以美国为首的帝国主义。帝国主义的末日已经不远了。一切帝国主义反动派都无法逃脱他们必然趋于灭亡的历史命运。美帝国主义推行其侵略政策和战争政策的结果，已经走向它的愿望的反面，激起世界人民越来越高涨的愤怒和反抗，就是证明。
    世界各国工人阶级面临着争取和平和社会主义的伟大历史任务。为着实现这个任务，共产主义队伍无论在国内范围或国际范围都需要坚如磐石的团结。这种团结必须建立在马克思列宁主义的基础之上。正因为如此，我们各国共产党人才把反对当前国际共产主义运动中最主要危险的现代修正主义，看成是自己的神圣的义务，而南斯拉夫修正主义正是现代修正主义的集中的表现。因此，我们各国共产党人不能不对南斯拉夫现代修正主义者进行毫不调和的斗争。
    南修正主义者堕落为工人阶级叛徒
    各国共产党人同他们没有共同语言
    南斯拉夫现代修正主义者已经背叛了马克思列宁主义一切最根本的原则，坚决地对抗被各国共产党所一致接受的莫斯科会议宣言，堕落成为工人阶级的叛徒。他们在资本主义总危机加深的时候，在右翼社会党人的改良主义对工人阶级和劳动人民的麻痹作用日益削弱的时候，提出了一个彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领来帮助帝国主义解除工人阶级的思想武装。这个纲领竭力为垄断资本辩护，混淆资本主义和社会主义的根本区别，鼓吹资本主义和平长入社会主义的反动思想，美化资产阶级专政而丑化无产阶级专政，把社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营这两种根本不同的世界政治经济体系等量齐观，公开污蔑以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，取消共产党的领导作用和反对列宁的建党学说，用资产阶级的民族主义来代替无产阶级国际主义的原则，用诡辩论来代替辩证法，等等。十分明显，这个纲领正是适应着帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的需要。为着破坏和分裂国际共产主义运动的团结而提出来的。因此，难道还能够认为在我们各国共产党人和南斯拉夫现代修正主义者之间有什么马克思列宁主义的共同思想政治基础和共同语言么？
    马克思列宁主义从来就是在同一切机会主义的斗争中发展起来的。南斯拉夫修正主义者在破坏国际共产主义运动方面，在反对社会主义制度方面，在粉饰和保护帝国主义方面，起到了右翼社会党人所不能起到的作用，他们充当了各国共产党人的反面教员。我们中国共产党人和各国共产党人一样感到非常高兴的是：在为维护马克思列宁主义的原则而同南斯拉夫现代修正主义的斗争中，一切马克思列宁主义政党都采取了一致立场，我们共产主义队伍的团结也因此而更加增强和巩固了，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的经济和文化，正在以资本主义世界所望尘莫及的速度，突飞猛进地发展着。
    同志们！目前中国，在建设社会主义的总路线的照耀下，已经出现了生产建设大跃进的新局面，这个局面必将有利于世界和平和社会主义，而得到各国人民的热烈支持。我们决不辜负各国人民对我国革命和建设所寄予的热望和各种支持。让我祝贺高举马克思列宁主义旗帜的丹麦共产党第二十次代表大会圆满成功！
    中丹两国兄弟党和人民互相关怀
    我们祝贺丹共获得新的更大成就
    最后，请允许我向大会宣读中国共产党中央委员会的贺电。
    中国共产党中央委员会的贺电全文如下：
    丹麦共产党第二十次代表大会全体代表同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表中国共产党全体党员和中国全体人民，向丹麦共产党第二十次代表大会，并且通过大会向丹麦共产党全体党员和丹麦劳动人民表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    中国共产党和中国人民一向关怀和同情丹麦共产党和丹麦人民所进行的捍卫民族独立、争取民主和社会进步、维护欧洲集体安全和世界和平的斗争，正像丹麦共产党和丹麦人民从来就关怀和同情我们的斗争一样。最近我国人民反对美国在台湾海峡地区扩大侵略的斗争，获得了丹麦人民的同情和支持，我们谨在此表示衷心的感谢。
    祝丹麦共产党在巩固自己的队伍、捍卫党的马克思列宁主义的统一、加强工人阶级的国内团结和国际团结等等方面取得新的更大的成就。
    祝丹麦共产党在为维护欧洲与世界和平和保卫丹麦的民主进步事业的斗争中，获得新的胜利！
    祝丹麦共产党代表大会圆满成功！
                    中国共产党中央委员会　1958年10月28日
