    Thanks to the People of Changge County for Their Support
    We farmers in Dehui County, Jilin Province, had no experience in digging wells. The county party committee requested assistance from Changge County, Henan Province, and Changge County immediately sent fifteen well-digging experts to support us. They also brought many valuable gifts for us, including 1,500 kilograms of corn seeds, five breeding donkeys, and fifty sheep. This sincere friendship and selfless help has greatly increased the drive and strength of the people of Dehui County. Now, these fifteen local experts and county, township, and commune water conservancy cadres are concentrated in Biangang Township, Dehui, to carry out intensive well-digging pilot work. The seeds of friendship from the people of Changge will blossom and bear fruit on the land of Dehui next year.

    感谢长葛县人民的支援
    我们吉林省德惠县农民没有打井的经验，县委去请求河南长葛县援助，长葛县立即派了十五位打井专家来支援。他们还带来了许多珍贵的礼品送给我们，其中有：玉米种籽一千五百公斤，种驴五头，绵羊五十只。这种真诚的友谊和无私的帮助，给德惠县人民增加了莫大的干劲和力量。现在这十五位土专家和县、乡、社水利干部集中在德惠边岗乡，进行紧张的打井试点工作。长葛人民友谊的种籽，明年将在德惠的土地上开花结果。
