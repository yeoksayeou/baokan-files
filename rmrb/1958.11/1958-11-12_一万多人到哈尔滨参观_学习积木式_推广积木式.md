Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 11th: More than 500 mechanical factories and schools from across the country have recently sent over 10,000 factory directors, engineers, and technical workers to visit and learn from the Harbin Mechanical United Machinery Factory's experience in vigorously developing "small, indigenous, and mass" methods for manufacturing large-scale equipment.

Visitors from various regions unanimously agreed that the experience of the Mechanical United Factory can be widely promoted. Some units originally planned to spend a lot of money next year to increase a large number of mechanical equipment to expand production. After visiting the Mechanical United Factory, they all believed that they could spend less, or even no money. Rao Bin, director of the First Automotive Works, led more than 180 engineers, technicians, and management cadres to the Mechanical United Machinery Factory to systematically study experiences such as "building block" machine tools. Luo Hong, the deputy director of the factory, said: The automotive factory's production tasks will increase several times next year. Originally, it was necessary to self-manufacture 700 sets of complex mechanical equipment. Now, with the "building block" machine tools of the Mechanical United Factory, the difficult problem could be solved by simply vacating a few warehouses as factory buildings. They have already self-made the first batch of "building block" machine tools and will soon be able to use both "small, indigenous, and mass" and "large, foreign, and mass" approaches to manufacture various automobiles. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory has also abandoned its plan to add 640 sets of equipment and plans to use old equipment to build "building block" machine tools and transform the repair workshop into a "building block" workshop to build new locomotives.

After learning the experience of the Mechanical United Machinery Factory, many small mechanical factories and repair factories are determined to build large-scale equipment such as smelting and power generation equipment. The Party Secretary of the Fushun Motor Factory saw the workers of the Mechanical United Machinery Factory were using "building block" machine tools to process the large shaft of a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine. He said excitedly: "The Mechanical United Machinery Factory is not as large as our factory, but it can make the large shaft of a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine, while we are still encountering many difficulties in making a 15,000-kilowatt steam turbine. We must overcome the difficulties, show great ambition, and also make 25,000-kilowatt to 50,000-kilowatt steam turbines."

Workers from light industrial factories such as the Jilin Paper Mill have also proposed to learn from the experience of the Mechanical United Factory and use the equipment capacity of their own repair workshops to manufacture large-scale paper-making machinery and equipment.

The newly built Jilin Chemical Machinery Factory originally needed an investment of 20 million yuan. After the factory director and technicians visited and studied at the Mechanical United Factory, they believed that "building block" machine tools were also very suitable for making large-scale chemical equipment. Therefore, they prepared to revise the factory construction design and build some simple factory buildings and "building block" machine tools.

    一万多人到哈尔滨参观
    学习积木式　推广积木式
    据新华社哈尔滨11日电　全国各地有五百多个机械工厂和学校最近先后派了一万多名厂长、工程师和技术工人等来参观学习哈尔滨机联机械厂大搞“小、土、群”制造大型设备的经验。
    各地来学习的人，一致认为机联厂的经验可以普遍推广。有些单位原来准备在明年花很多钱增加大批机械设备扩大生产，参观了机联厂之后都认为可以少花甚至不花了。第一汽车制造厂厂长饶斌带领一百八十多个工程师、技术工人和管理干部到机联机械厂系统地学习“积木式”机床等经验。这个厂的副厂长罗红说：汽车厂明年的生产任务要加几番，原来需要自制七百台复杂的机械设备，现在用机联厂这种“积木式”机床，只要腾出几间仓库当厂房，就解决了这个困难问题。他们已经自制出第一批“积木式”机床，不久就可以用“小、土、群”和“大、洋、群”两条腿走路来制造各种汽车。大连机车车辆制造工厂也打消了增添六百四十台设备的计划，准备利用旧设备大造“积木式”机床，并且将机修车间改为“积木式”车间，来大造新式的机车。
    许多小型机械工厂和机修工厂学习了机联机械厂的经验以后，决心要大造冶炼、发电等大型设备。抚顺电机厂党委书记看到机联机械厂职工正在用“积木式”机床加工二万五千瓩汽轮机大轴，他激动地说：“机联机械厂没有我们厂子大，却能干二万五千瓩汽轮机的大轴，我们做一万五千瓩汽轮机，还碰到许多困难。我们一定踢开困难，拿出雄心大志，也要做二万五千瓩到五万瓩的汽轮机”。
    吉林造纸厂等轻工业工厂的职工也提出要学习机联厂经验，利用自己检修车间的设备能力，来制造大型造纸机器设备。
    新建的吉林化工机械厂原来需要投资二千万元，这个厂厂长和技术人员到机联厂参观学习以后，认为“积木式”机床也很适合做大型化工设备，因此准备修改建厂设计，另建一部分简易厂房和“积木式”机床就可以了。
