Xinhua News Agency, 10th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Socialist Party held a meeting of its chairman and bureau directors in Tokyo today. The meeting reaffirmed that the Diet session had ended on November 7th, and that meetings from the 8th onwards were invalid. Therefore, the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" had become a dead letter.

The Socialist Party firmly stated that as long as the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party do not recognize the invalidity of the resolution to extend the Diet session and scrap the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill," and as long as the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives do not resign, the Socialist Party will not accept any contact regarding compromise. This decision of the Socialist Party Chairman and Bureau Directors Meeting was unanimously approved at the subsequent Socialist Party Diet Members' Meeting.

Today's meeting also decided that Socialist Party Diet members will continue to not attend abnormal Diet meetings. After the 16th, all Diet members will leave Tokyo and disperse to various regions to conduct large-scale nationwide speaking tours. Before the 15th, Diet members will hold rallies in ten locations in Tokyo to demand the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, the safeguarding of democracy, and the dissolution of the Diet.

The meeting also pointed out that if the Liberal Democratic Party arbitrarily deliberates on the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" and other bills in the Diet, that would be a one-party dictatorship by the Liberal Democratic Party and a fascist act by the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet. The Socialist Party will appeal to public opinion and thoroughly investigate responsibility.

The meeting stated that the issue of demanding the resignation of the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives must be pursued to the end; and that the Speaker's ugly attempts to salvage the situation must be opposed head-on.

The meeting also decided to further strengthen the struggle outside the Diet. To this end, the Socialist Party will request various organizations, with labor unions at the core, to launch protest activities with the maximum possible strength.

Currently, Socialist Party Diet members are no longer going to the Diet. They are specifically engaging in activities outside the Diet, accusing the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party of illegal actions to public opinion. In recent days, Socialist Party Diet members have been conducting publicity in Tokyo using broadcast vehicles and buses, exposing Nobusuke Kishi's despicable tactics of using tricks to extend the Diet session. Socialist Party Secretary-General Inajiro Asanuma delivered a speech on the streets of Tokyo today, demanding the dissolution of the House of Representatives, the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and the defense of democracy.

This afternoon, Socialist Party Diet Member Chairman Kubota and nine other representatives met with the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives, and, based on the decision made by the Socialist Party Central Executive Committee some time ago, formally requested the Speaker to declare the resolution to extend the session invalid based on his authority, and also requested the Speaker and Vice-Speaker to resign to take responsibility.

Speaker of the House of Representatives, Niro Hoshijima, at the time admitted that "the method of extending the session was not good," but still unreasonably rejected all the demands of the Socialist Party.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th, Tokyo Dispatch: Nobusuke Kishi's fascist actions of forcibly extending the Japanese Diet session and insisting on passing the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" have put him in a situation where he is besieged on all sides, and have deepened divisions within the Liberal Democratic Party.

Former Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama and others have already demanded that Nobusuke Kishi withdraw this unpopular amendment bill. Even Nobusuke Kishi's Minister of State for Economic Planning, Takeo Miki, has publicly requested that Nobusuke Kishi reconsider his stubborn policy.

At today's Liberal Democratic Party Advisory Council meeting, "anti-mainstream" members Kenzo Matsumura and Okubo Rentaro both spoke out against the Liberal Democratic Party unilaterally deliberating on the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" in the Diet.

"Anti-mainstream" members Takeo Miki, Kenzo Matsumura, Kojiro Ishii, Tanzan Ishibashi, and 22 other Liberal Democratic Party Diet members held their own meeting after the Advisory Council meeting ended. They stated that it was necessary to avoid "situations where the Liberal Democratic Party alone carries out Diet deliberations."

In order to escape his isolated situation, Nobusuke Kishi is currently sending people around to win over and lobby some Japanese political elders, using the pretext of supporting his proposal to hold talks with Socialist Party Chairman Mozaburo Suzuki. He wants them to come out and emphasize so-called "unity within the party" in order to stabilize his position within the Liberal Democratic Party and help him clean up the current mess. Nobusuke Kishi himself also visited former Prime Ministers Ichiro Hatoyama and Shigeru Yoshida on the 9th, asking for their "cooperation." When Nobusuke Kishi visited Yoshida, Yoshida, in addition to helping Nobusuke Kishi shout some empty slogans about "unity within the ruling party," could not come up with any other solutions. Yoshida, on the grounds of not understanding "the course of events of the problem," refused to hold a so-called "meeting of elders" in the Japanese political world to help the desperate Nobusuke Kishi escape his predicament.

Nobusuke Kishi also held talks with Kojiro Ishii, Tanzan Ishibashi, and others today, asking for their "cooperation."

    坚决要求解散众议院打倒岸政府
    日本社会党决定加强国会外的斗争
    自由民主党内部分歧加深　岸信介陷于四面楚歌
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天在东京举行了委员长和局长会议。会议再次肯定：国会会期已经在11月7日终止，从8日起的会议无效，因此，“警察官职务执行法修正案”已经成为废案。
    社会党坚决表示，只要岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党一天不承认延长国会会期的决议无效和把“警察官职务执行法修正案”作废，众议院正副议长一天不辞职，社会党就一天不接受一切关于妥协的接洽。社会党委员长和局长会议的这一决定，在随后举行的社会党议员会议上也得到一致同意。
    今天的会议还决定，社会党的议员今后仍然不出席不正常的国会会议，全体议员16日以后就要离开东京，分散到各地去进行全国范围的大规模的旅行演说。在15日以前，议员们将在东京的十处地方举行打倒岸信介内阁、维护民主和要求解散国会的演讲会。
    会议还指出，如果自由民主党擅自在国会审议“警察官职务执行法修正案”等法案，那就是自由民主党的一党独裁，就是岸信介内阁的法西斯行为，社会党就要诉诸舆论，彻底追究责任。
    会议表示，对于要求众议院正副议长辞职的问题要追究到底；对于丑态百出的议长设法收拾局面的活动要从正面加以反对。
    会议还决定要进一步加强国会外面的斗争，为此，社会党要请求以工会为核心的各团体进行最大限度的实力斗争来展开抗议活动。
    现在，社会党议员已经不再到国会去。他们专门在国会外面展开活动，向舆论控诉岸信介政府和自由民主党的非法行为。这几天，社会党议员在东京乘着广播车和公共汽车进行宣传，揭露岸信介使用诡计延长国会会期的卑鄙作法。社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎今天在东京街头发表演说，要求解散众议院，打倒岸信介内阁，保卫民主。
    今天下午，社会党议员会长久保田等九名代表到国会会见众议院正副议长，根据社会党中央执行委员会在前些时候作出的决定，正式要求议长根据他的职权宣布延长会期的决议无效，并且要求正副议长引咎辞职。
    众议院议长星岛二郎当时承认“延长会期的办法不好”，但是仍然无理地拒绝了社会党的一切要求。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：岸信介强行延长日本国会会期和坚持要使国会通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”的法西斯做法，已经使得他自己陷于四面楚歌的地步，并且使得自由民主党内部的分歧日益加深。
    前日本首相鸠山一郎等已经要求岸信介撤回这个不得人心的修正案。甚至岸信介内阁的经济企划厅长官三木武夫也公开要求岸信介重新考虑他的顽固政策。
    在今天举行的自由民主党顾问会议上，“反主流派”的松村谦三和大久保留次郎都发言反对自由民主党在国会内单方面审议“警察官职务执行法修正案”。
    “反主流派”的三木武夫、松村谦三、石井光次郎、石桥湛山等二十六个自由民主党的议员在顾问会议结束以后又自行举行了会议，他们表示必须避免“硬由自由民主党单独进行国会审议工作的情况”。
    岸信介为了摆脱他的孤立的处境，目前正在派人四出拉拢和疏通一些日本政界元老，以支持他提出的同社会党委员长铃木茂三郎举行会谈的主张为幌子，要他们出来强调所谓“党内的团结”，以便稳住他在自由民主党内的地位和帮助他收拾目前这个烂摊子。岸信介本人也在9日分别访问了前首相鸠山一郎和吉田茂，要求他们“合作”。当岸信介访问吉田的时候，吉田除了帮助岸信介嚷嚷了一通“执政党内部团结起来”的空话以外，也拿不出别的办法来。吉田以不了解“发生问题的经过情形”为理由，拒绝举行所谓日本政界的“元老会议”来帮助走投无路的岸信介脱出困境。
    岸信介今天又找了石井光次郎、石桥湛山等人会谈，要求他们“合作”。
