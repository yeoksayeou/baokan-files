    Selfless and Altruistic Laborer

    In Nanjing, during a winter night, the northwest wind howled fiercely, as if the sky was about to crack. At this time, the young tricycle worker He Yongzao was pedaling his tricycle against the wind. He stepped into the city center, in front of the Central Department Store, and saw an old woman sitting blankly on the steps, holding her right cheek with both hands. He thought, it seemed that this old woman was probably lost. In such cold weather, at this age, staying here overnight, wouldn't she freeze? He immediately jumped off his tricycle, walked to the old woman, and found out that she was from Shandong, looking for her son who worked in the Nanjing Shangxinhe military unit. On the way, she had lost her letter in a hurry, didn't remember the detailed address, and had run out of money. She was very anxious. When He Yongzao heard that she was a military dependent from another place, he immediately said, "It doesn't matter if you don't have money, I will help you find him." But, not knowing the place name, how could he find him in the middle of the night? He helped the old woman onto his tricycle and took her straight to his home. After arriving home, his wife made her food, and he went out and got two clean quilts, made the bed for her to sleep in. The old woman was very touched by such warm hospitality. Early the next morning, He Yongzao let the old woman sit on the tricycle and helped her find her son. After delivering her, he didn't ask for any reward and rode away.

    Another day at noon, He Yongzao was pedaling his tricycle to Huaiqiao in the south of the city when he saw a woman who had fainted by the roadside. He quickly jumped off and helped her onto his tricycle and took her to the hospital. At the hospital, he paid for her registration himself. When the hospital learned that this woman had no family relationship with He Yongzao, they praised his spirit and decided not to charge her for medicine, and also returned the registration fee to He Yongzao.

    This woman lived in Lukou, a suburb of the city, and had come to the city two days ago to visit relatives. Someone sent a message saying that her mother was ill, and she was rushing home, tired and anxious, and fainted. Lukou was still far away, and He Yongzao, after she took the medicine and recovered, took her to the bus station. He not only didn't charge her for the ride, but also paid for her bus ticket. But He Yongzao didn't have enough money; at this time, a woman next to her saw He Yongzao selflessly helping people, was very moved, and automatically added money, bought a ticket, and sent her back.

    There are many examples of He Yongzao's selflessness. His partner Xu Baokang even wrote a poem for him:

        Youth Captain He Yongzao,
        Serves passengers very thoughtfully,
        Selfless and altruistic, not caring about rewards,
        Excellent worker, high awareness. (Attached image)

    忘我无私的劳动者
    南京市的冬夜，西北风刮得呼呼响，天像是要裂开了。这时候年轻的三轮车工人何永藻蹬着三轮车顶风挺进。他踏进市中心区中央商场门前，看到台阶上有个老太太，双手托着右颊呆坐着。他想，看样子这个老太太大概是迷路了。这样冷的天，这大年纪，呆在这儿一夜，不冻坏了么？他马上跳下车，走到老太太面前，原来这位老太太的儿子在南京上新河部队里工作，老太太是从山东来找儿子的。途中，慌慌忙忙把信弄丢了，详细地址也没记清，路费也用光了，正在着急。何永藻听说是个外乡军属，马上说：“没钱没关系，我帮你找。”但是，不知道地名，深更半夜的怎么找得到呢？他就把老太太扶上车，径直拉到了自己家。到家后，他妻子给她做饭，自己出去弄了两床干净被，铺好床给她睡。这样热情的招待，老太太很受感动。第二天一大早，何永藻就让老太太坐上三轮，替她找到了儿子。送到以后，他不要报酬，骑着车就走了。
    另一天的中午，何永藻踏着三轮车到城南的怀桥，见一位妇女，昏倒在路旁。他连忙跳下来，把这位妇女扶上车就往医院里送。到医院，自己掏钱代她挂号。当院方得知这位妇女同何永藻没有任何亲属关系，很赞扬他的精神，决定不收药费，并把挂号费也退给了何永藻。
    这位妇女家住市郊禄口，前天来城里探亲。有人捎信说她妈妈病了，她赶着回家，又累又急，一下晕倒了。到禄口还很远，何永藻等她吃药后精神恢复了，又把她拉到汽车站。他不仅没要车费，还掏钱代她买汽车票。但是何永藻的钱不够；这时，旁边有位妇女看到何永藻无私地帮助人，很感动，自动添了钱，买了一张票，送她回去了。
    何永藻这种舍己为人的事例很多。他的同伴徐保康还给他编了一首诗：
        青年队长何永藻，
        服务乘客真周到，
        忘我无私不计酬，
        优秀工人觉悟高。（附图片）
