    Little Hero Grows Giant Cucumber

    In a corner of the Comprehensive Hall, inside a specially made glass display case, there is a "Cucumber King" that is three feet nine inches long. It was cultivated by Wang Mingliang, a fourth-grade student at the Jiefang Elementary School of the Jiefang Commune in Dalad Banner, Yikezhao League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He selected a local variety called "Tandi Bula," planted thirty-five seedlings on 0.012 mu of semi-sandy soil, and harvested 315 cucumbers, totaling 3,150 jin. On average, each cucumber weighed 10 jin, with the heaviest weighing 17.4 jin.

    This young friend cultivated the cucumbers during the local rural drive to create experimental fields and high-yield fields through deep plowing. At the time, the teachers encouraged everyone, saying, "Young Pioneers should contribute to this movement by applying more fertilizer and planting more land." Wang Mingliang deep-plowed the land to a depth of two chi, applied 350 jin of base fertilizer, top-dressed eleven times, and watered every two days. His diligent labor finally resulted in a bumper harvest. He was selected to attend the League's Little Hero meeting. (Attached picture)

    小英雄种大黄瓜
    在综合馆的一角，一个特制的玻璃橱里，有一条长达三尺九寸的“黄瓜王”。它是内蒙古自治区伊克昭盟达拉特旗解放乡解放社小学四年级学生王明亮栽培出来的。他选择当地名叫“滩地不拉”的品种，在一厘二毫的半砂土上种了三十五苗，结了三百十五条黄瓜，共重三千一百五十斤，平均每条十斤，最重的一条达十七斤四两。
    这个小朋友是在当地农村大搞试验田、丰产田的深翻运动中栽培黄瓜的，当时老师们鼓励大家说：“少先队员要在这个运动中贡献出力量，要多施肥、多种地。”王明亮把地深翻了二尺，施了底肥三百五十斤，又追肥十一次，每两天就浇一次水，辛勤劳动终于获得了丰收。他被选出席了全盟的小英雄会。（附图片）
