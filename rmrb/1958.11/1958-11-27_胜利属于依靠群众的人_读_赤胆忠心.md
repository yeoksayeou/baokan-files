    Victory Belongs to Those Who Rely on the Masses
    —Reading "Utmost Loyalty"
    Yang Chang
    "Utmost Loyalty" describes the activities of a guerrilla force led by Comrade Li Yunchang in eastern Hebei from 1938 to 1940, prominently depicting the deeds of the guerrilla captain, martyr Jie Zhenguo.
    Jie Zhenguo was a Communist Party member who grew up as a miner, educated and led by the workers' movement and the Party. Jie Zhenguo's life points out such a truth to the people: although everyone only has one life, to live it meaningfully, one should not endure humiliation and survive under the enemy's bayonets and the exploitation of foreign capitalists but should bravely stand up and fight the enemy!
    Before Jie Zhenguo organized the guerrilla force, their lives were like this: "...although the miners worked like slaves, they were so poor that they couldn't even afford cornbread and sorghum porridge. ...In addition to the oppression and exploitation of British capitalists, the workers also had to endure the exploitation and enslavement of contractors." Jie Zhenguo, a twenty-nine-year-old prop worker, was often bent over by the props. In the spring of 1938, a major strike was held at the Kailuan No. 5 Mine. Because "Jie Zhenguo was a righteous man with good mass relations, and many workers in the mine were of one mind with him," the Party entrusted him with the position of strike committee member and leader of the disciplinary team. During the strike, the British capitalists colluded with the Japanese invaders and suppressed the workers with their military police. Jie Zhenguo escaped death under the bayonets of the Japanese invaders and went to Hanjia Shao Village in eastern Hebei to organize a guerrilla force mainly composed of miners.
    Jie Zhenguo's guerrilla force was brave and resourceful, and closely relied on the masses, so they had great courage and created miracles. They once broke into the enemy's police station with a small number of people and punished the traitorous police chief. They also attacked the Japanese invaders' bunkers with just a few people.
    Jie Zhenguo and his men killed enemies and eliminated evil for the masses, and the masses also used their actions to show their love for Jie Zhenguo's team. In one battle, Jie Zhenguo and his men suffered losses. The next day, the villagers all knew that the battle had not gone well because a stray dog barking had alerted the enemy, so they killed all their beloved pet dogs so that Jie Zhenguo and his men could sneak up on the enemy at night in the future.
    How could a team rooted in the hearts of the masses not create miracles? The story in the book "Utmost Loyalty" seems like a legendary novel, but it is based on real people and events. This story is written with the blood of martyrs, their utmost loyalty, and their excellent qualities of closely relying on the masses. Therefore, when we read this book, we receive great education and inspiration from the simple and concise words: only by fighting with utmost loyalty for the cause of the people can we gain the love and support of the masses. Only by closely relying on the masses and gaining their love and support can our cause be victorious.

    胜利属于依靠群众的人
    ——读“赤胆忠心”
    杨畅
    “赤胆忠心”写的是1938年至1940年在冀东由李运昌同志领导的一支游击队的活动，突出地描写了游击队长节振国烈士的事迹。
    节振国是一个矿工出身，在工人运动中和党的领导教育下成长起来的共产党员。节振国的一生向人们指出了这样一个真理：生命每人虽然只有一次，但是，要活得有意义，就不能在敌人的刺刀和外国资本家的剥削下忍辱偷生而应该勇敢地站起来同敌人战斗！
    在节振国组织游击队以前，他们的生活是这样的：“……虽然矿工们像奴隶似地劳动，可是穷得连窝头秫米粥还吃不上。……除了英国资本家的压迫与剥削，工人们还要忍受着包工大柜的盘剥和奴役。”二十九岁的支柱工节振国，也是常常被支柱压得直不起腰来。1938年春天，开滦五矿举行了大罢工。因为“节振国是一个见义勇为的人，群众关系好，矿上跟他一条心的工人很多”，所以党就委托他担任了罢工委员和纠察队长的职务。在罢工运动中因为英国资本家与日本侵略者的勾结而遭到鬼子宪兵的镇压，节振国在日寇的刺刀下，死里逃生，到冀东的韩家梢村去组织了一支主要由矿工组成的游击队。
    节振国这支游击队，英勇机智，并且紧紧地依靠着群众，因此，他们就有了天大的胆子，创造了奇迹。他们曾经以少数人闯入了敌人的警察所，惩办了汉奸警察所长。他们还以几个人的力量，奇袭了日寇的碉堡。
    节振国他们为群众杀敌除暴，群众也用自己的行动来表示对节振国队伍的热爱。在一次战斗里，节振国他们吃了亏。第二天，老乡们都知道这一仗没有打好，是由于一条野狗乱叫引起敌人的注意而失利了，他们就把喂养着的心爱的家犬全部都杀光了，以便节振国他们以后在夜间偷袭敌人。
    一个在群众的心上生了根的队伍，怎么不会创造出奇迹来呢？“赤胆忠心”这本书里的故事，看起来像一个传奇小说，但是它却是真人真事。这个故事，是由烈士们的血，由他们的赤胆忠心和紧紧依靠群众的优秀品质写成的。因此，当我们读到这本书的时候，就从那朴实简洁的字里行间，得到很大的教育和启发：只有赤胆忠心地为人民的事业而奋斗，才会得到群众的爱戴和支持。只有紧紧地依靠群众，得到群众的爱戴和支持，我们的事业才会胜利。
