Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 22nd: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party today issued a statement regarding the outcome of the summit meeting between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialist Party of Japan. It demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke group's decision to extend the Diet's extraordinary session be declared invalid. It also called on all Japanese people to further strengthen the people's power that has already forced the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment" (hereinafter referred to as the "Police Duties Law") into unresolved deliberation, and to fight to the end to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The statement, adopted at the third meeting of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, which began on the 21st and lasted for three days, said that the great unity of all Japanese people, centered on the working class, finally forced the "Police Duties Law" amendment into unresolved deliberation, thereby dealing a heavy blow to the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. This is an achievement of the Japanese democratic forces in their struggle based on the wishes of all Japanese people, and it is also a preliminary guarantee for further carrying out the struggle and achieving victory in the future.

The statement accused the Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialist Party of Japan of ignoring the demands of the people and deciding to extend the Diet's extraordinary session. The statement pointed out that this is, in fact, an act of acknowledging the Liberal Democratic Party's outrageous behavior of using cunning means to extend the Diet's extraordinary session, under the beautiful guise of safeguarding democracy and normalizing Diet meetings. The Japanese people absolutely cannot tolerate this behavior.

The statement pointed out that the purpose of the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to revise the "Police Duties Law" is clearly to suppress the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The Kishi Nobusuke government attempts to submit the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" amendment to the next Diet's regular session. By acknowledging the Liberal Democratic Party's illegal extension of the Diet's extraordinary session, there is a risk of restricting the people's struggle against this conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The statement pointed out that although the "Police Duties Law Amendment" became an unresolved bill at this Diet's extraordinary session, Kishi Nobusuke and some groups within the Liberal Democratic Party are still attempting to submit a disguised "Police Duties Law Amendment" to the next Diet session. Therefore, the joint struggle organizations against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" must fight to the end to completely crush this conspiracy.

The statement demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet assume responsibility for causing this political turmoil and immediately resign. The statement called for expanding the current struggle against the "Police Duties Law," and combining the struggle to safeguard life and rights from the end of this year to the spring of next year with the struggle against the revision and demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and further expanding it into a struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and demand the dissolution of the Diet.

The statement finally called on the Japanese working class and all the people to unite and launch various struggles appropriate to the current situation in their respective posts, and strive for the success of the national struggle against the "Police Duties Law" scheduled for the 26th.

    日共号召人民团结一致
    扩大反对“警职法”的斗争
    要求宣布岸集团延长国会会期的决定无效
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会今天就日本执政党自由民主党同社会党举行两党首脑会谈的结果发表声明，要求宣布岸信介集团关于延长国会临时会议会期的决定无效，并且号召日本全体人民进一步加强已经迫使“警察官职务执行法修正案”（简称“警职法”）成为审议未了的法案的人民的力量，为争取废除日美“安全条约”而斗争到底。
    这项在从21日起举行的为期三天的日本共产党中央委员会第三次会议上通过的声明说，以工人阶级为中心的全体日本人民的伟大团结终于迫使“警职法”修正案成为审议未了的法案，从而给予岸信介内阁以沉重的打击。这是日本民主力量根据全体日本人民的愿望而进行斗争所获得的成就，也是今后进一步开展斗争和取得胜利的初步保证。
    声明指责自由民主党和社会党忽视人民的要求，确定国会临时会议会期的延长。声明指出，这是假借维护民主和使国会会议正常化的美丽辞句，事实上承认自由民主党使用奸诈手段延长国会临时会议会期的横暴行动的行为，日本人民绝对不能容忍这种行为。
    声明指出，岸信介政府阴谋修改“警职法”的目的，显然在于镇压日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争。岸信介政府企图向下届国会平时会议提出日美“安全条约”修正案，由于这次承认自由民主党非法延长国会临时会议会期的横暴行动，将有束缚人民反对岸信介政府这种阴谋的斗争的危险。
    声明指出，“警职法修正案”虽然成为这次国会临时会议的审议未了的法案，但是岸信介和自由民主党内部的一些集团还在企图向下届国会会议再次提出变相的“警职法修正案”。因此，反对修改“警职法”的共同斗争组织今后必须为完全粉碎这种阴谋而斗争到底。
    声明要求岸信介内阁承担造成这次政局混乱的责任，立即引咎辞职。声明号召扩大目前反对“警职法”的斗争，并且使从今年年底开始到明年春季为维护生活与权利而进行的斗争同反对修改和要求废除日美“安全条约”的斗争结合起来，进一步使它扩展成为打倒岸信介内阁和要求解散国会的斗争。
    声明最后号召日本工人阶级和全体人民团结一致，在各个岗位展开适应当前情况的各种斗争，努力使预定在26日举行的反对“警职法”的全国斗争取得成功。
