Bringing Along and Squeezing
Wang Pu

Due to differences in people's ways of thinking, there are often different, even opposite, views on one thing. Take the matter of "taking steel as the key link," for example. There are two completely opposite arguments. Some say: Taking steel as the key link has driven and promoted everything; others say: Taking steel as the key link has suppressed and squeezed out everything. One praising and one criticizing, the difference in ideological viewpoints is very clear.

Did taking steel as the key link drive and promote everything, or did it suppress and squeeze out everything? As early as before the mass iron and steel campaign was launched, the Party Central Committee pointed out: It is necessary to take steel as the key link to drive and promote the high-speed development of all industries. The steel industry is the foundation of all industries. From eight years of practice, especially from the practice of the comprehensive leap forward in industry and agriculture in the first half of this year, we have deeply realized the importance of steel. Without an inch of iron, it is difficult to move an inch. With steel, everything is easier. Insufficient steel is the main contradiction in socialist industrial construction. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that in the development process of complex things, there are many contradictions. Among them, there must be a dominant, decisive main contradiction. Grasping the main contradiction, all problems can be solved easily. Taking steel as the key link is precisely grasping the main contradiction in industrial construction. When the key link is straightened out, the whole thing falls into place. The practice of the last two or three months proves that taking steel as the key link has indeed driven and promoted everything. It has driven and promoted the machinery industry, the coal industry, the electric power industry, the chemical industry, the petroleum industry, the forestry industry, and the building materials industry, and also driven and promoted the transportation industry and the postal and telecommunications services. Now, not only is doubling steel production a certainty, but other industries are also advancing at an unprecedented speed. One horse takes the lead, and ten thousand horses gallop. This is the new situation in China's current economic life.

Those who say that taking steel as the key link suppresses and squeezes out everything mainly see that in some departments that are not directly related to the steel industry, the supply of labor, raw materials, equipment, transportation, and power is placed behind in giving way to the "marshal," and the speed of production leap forward is not as fast as other industries. Therefore, these people shouted: Steel is about to overwhelm me, iron has squeezed him out.

Taking steel as the key link has indeed squeezed some enterprises and departments that are not directly related to the steel industry, placing them behind. However, this was expected long ago and was a deliberate move. Because, letting the "marshal" of steel and the enterprises and departments directly related to it take the lead, allowing them to enjoy "priority" in terms of labor, raw materials, equipment, and transportation, can open up a path for the great leap forward of the entire national economy, including the enterprises and departments that are behind. Being squeezed temporarily today in exchange for a great leap forward tomorrow, what's wrong with that? Moreover, even from the current point of view, squeezing and suppressing also have a promoting effect on those enterprises and departments that are squeezed and suppressed. For example, in giving way to the "marshal," civil construction enterprises have created the experience of building "four-no" buildings, that is, building buildings without using steel, wood, cement, or red bricks. Because the light industry sector did not have steel, ceramic equipment has also greatly developed. Both giving way to the "marshal" and achieving a leap forward, a win-win situation. Without this squeeze, "four-no" buildings and ceramic equipment might not have been created, and even if they had been created, they might not have been quickly and widely promoted. Therefore, squeezing and being placed behind is also a way of driving and promoting, not squeezing until there is no way to go, and not suppressing until one cannot recover.

Taking steel as the key link is a path to achieving industrialization at high speed that China has explored from practice over the past seven or eight years. Now, enterprises and departments that have been directly driven and promoted by steel are continuing to follow up; those that have been temporarily squeezed and placed behind have already or will soon catch up. Practice has educated us and encouraged us. We will firmly and unwaveringly stride forward along this path.

    带和挤
    王朴
    由于人们的思想方法不同，对一件事物，往往有着不同的、甚至相反的看法。拿“以钢为纲”这件事来说，就有两种完全相反的议论。有人说：以钢为纲，带动和促进了一切；有人说：以钢为纲，压倒和挤掉了一切。一褒一贬，思想观点之不同，真是鲜明得很。
    以钢为纲，到底是带动和促进了一切呢，还是压倒和挤掉了一切？早在全民办钢铁运动还没有掀起的时候，党中央就指出：要以钢为纲，带动和促进一切工业高速度地发展。钢铁工业是一切工业的基础。从八年的实践，特别是今年上半年工农业全面大跃进的实践中，我们深深地体会到了钢铁之重要。手无寸铁，寸步难行，有了钢铁，一切事情就好办。钢铁不足，这是社会主义工业建设中的主要矛盾。毛泽东同志教导我们，在复杂的事物的发展过程中，有着许多矛盾存在着，其中必有一种是主导的、有决定性作用的主要矛盾，抓住了主要矛盾，一切问题就可迎刃而解。以钢为纲，正是抓住了工业建设中的主要矛盾。纲举目张。最近两三个月的实践证明，以钢为纲，的确是带动和促进了一切。它带动和促进了机械工业、煤炭工业、电力工业、化学工业、石油工业、森林工业、建筑材料工业，也带动和促进了交通运输业和邮电事业。现在不仅钢产量翻一番已成定局，而且其它工业也以空前的高速度前进着，一马当先，万马奔腾，这就是当前我国经济生活的新形势。
    说以钢为纲，压倒和挤掉一切的人，主要是看到有些跟钢铁工业没有直接关系的部门，在给元帅让路中，劳动力、原材料、设备、运输工具和动力等的供应被排到后面去了，生产跃进的速度不像别的行业那样快。于是，这些人就大喊起来：钢把我快压倒了，铁把他挤掉了。
    以钢为纲，的确把一些与钢铁工业没有直接关系的企业和部门挤了一挤，往后面排了一排。然而，这是早就预料到的，而且是有意下的一着棋。因为，让钢铁元帅和与它有直接关系的企业和部门先走一步，让它们在劳动力、原材料、设备和交通运输等方面享有“优先权”，就可以给整个国民经济，也包括排在后面的企业和部门，开辟大跃进的道路。今天暂时被挤一挤，换来明天的大跃进，这有什么不好呢？而且，即使从当前来看，挤一挤，压一压，对那些被挤被压的企业和部门也有促进的作用。例如民用建筑企业在给“元帅”让路中，“四不用”大楼，即不用钢材、木材、水泥和红砖盖大楼的经验被创造出来了。轻工业部门因为没有钢材，陶瓷设备也就大大发展了起来。既给“元帅”让路，自己又跃进，两全其美。若没有这一挤，“四不用”大楼和陶瓷设备不一定能创造出来，即使创造出来了，也不一定很快地普遍推广起来。所以说，挤一挤，往后排，也是一种带动和促进的方法，并不是一挤就要挤到无路可走，一压就要压得不能翻身。
    以钢为纲，这是我国七、八年来从实践中摸索出来的一条高速度地实现工业化的道路。现在，已经被钢直接带动和促进了的企业和部门，正在继续跟上去；暂时被挤一挤、排在后面的，也已经或就要很快地跟上来。实践教育了我们，也鼓舞了我们。我们将坚定地、毫不动摇地沿着这条道路大踏步前进。
