    Ten Thousand Cannons Shake Jinmen
    ——Sketches from the Fujian Front, Part 1
    Liu Baiyu
    November 3rd was a clear day. In the early morning, I arrived at the frontline mountain position in Xiamen. The sea was a vast expanse of blue, and Great Jinmen Island was still submerged in fog. There wasn't a single figure to be seen on Little Jinmen Island.
    The night before, the Fujian Front Command of our army openly broadcast to the military and civilians of the Jinmen Islands:
      "Attention, compatriots, military and civilians of the Jinmen Islands: Today, November 2nd, is an even-numbered day, and we have not fired a single shot, and you received supplies. Tomorrow, November 3rd, is an odd-numbered day, so do not come out under any circumstances! Pay attention! Pay attention!"
    Chiang Kai-shek's troops indeed strictly obeyed the order. After listening to the broadcast, they hurriedly withdrew their ships from the Liaoluo Bay. The sea appeared so empty, with only the shimmering waves reflecting the light. But I knew that the hands of the clock were moving forward, and everything was waiting for an already decided moment to arrive. The soldiers' hands might be gripping the elevating wheels of the cannons, or they might be wiping the shells again and again. I remembered that just over ten days ago, I was abroad, explaining to several Asian and African friends the question of why the Taiwan Strait war, which they were enthusiastically concerned about but also found "mysteriously unsolvable," was the noose of imperialism. And now, I myself was experiencing this unprecedented new page in the history of warfare firsthand. I heard a senior commander answering questions on the phone: "Don't touch that tower, the tower is a historical site. We'll want to take a good look at it when we get there! Aim at military targets, don't hit civilian houses and barracks! There's too much smoke, wait for the smoke to clear and aim carefully!"
    I had to take advantage of the moment before the cannons fired to carefully experience this new war life. Young naval soldiers, wearing navy blue uniforms with white collars, were doing complex work on map boards, their clever eyes flashing with confidence in victory. I had lived in the tunnels of the Korean front, but the tunnels here were like neat streets, you could walk through them without bending over, electric lights were lit on the tunnel ceilings, and the walls were covered with wall newspapers full of poems by soldiers with hearts as broad as the sea and feelings as hot as the sun. The parapets of the communication trenches were densely covered with telephone lines, reminding you of the complex and sensitive nervous system of a person. What surprised me was that when I turned back from the observation hole, I suddenly saw a comrade I knew standing in front of me. His big eyes flashed a smile. He was the one we sent earliest to master artillery in the ice and snow of the Northeast, during the three campaigns south of the Yangtze River. At that time, the enemy's artillery still had an absolute advantage. At that time, we searched piece by piece for the lost parts of Japanese artillery from the wilderness. We built our powerful artillery from scratch with our own hands in fierce struggle. Let those who are shelled fairly evaluate the power of our artillery! This is also an example of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind.
    After sending troops to invade the Middle East, American imperialism is again playing with fire in the Taiwan Strait. Chiang Kai-shek's troops are also provoking us with artillery fire. Starting from August 23rd, we are carrying out artillery punishment against them. The Jinmen Chiang troops immediately exclaimed: "The shells are falling like a rainstorm!" "Our warships are on fire!" Sure enough, a US-made warship of the Chiang army was blown into two pieces and is now lying on the surface of Liaoluo Bay. At this time, they were at a loss and could not help but ask: "Where are our American friends?" The shelling began on the 23rd, and it happened that the 24th was the closing day of the UN General Assembly discussing the American and British invasion of Lebanon and Jordan. Just as one wave subsided, another rose again, and everyone pointed their fingers at Dulles and cursed him. He wanted to ignite the flames of war to scare people, but as a result, he was surrounded by the angry flames and smoke of the people of the world. The Chinese people who have stood up have never been afraid of American imperialism, and they have both hands grasping the noose around the neck of American imperialism. It is certainly not dignified for the "gentlemen" of Wall Street to have a noose around their necks, but since they put the noose on themselves, they can only taste the feeling of the noose tightening themselves!
    The port of Great Jinmen Island emerged from the fog. The time has come! The commander looked at his watch and issued the command "Ready!" I heard the sound of the command being relayed from the artillery positions over the phone: "Ready!..." Then there was a sudden silence, not a sound was heard. Finally, the commander raised his head and shouted, "Fire!"
    In order to see the full view of the shelling, I ran to the communication trench outside the tunnel. The sea was a clear mirror, the sun was shining brightly, and suddenly it was like ten million sparks were bursting, white flashes of light were sparkling everywhere, and ten thousand shells were fired in unison, soaring into the sky. I fixed my eyes on Little Jinmen Island, which was originally motionless, and suddenly, here and there, small puffs of bright white smoke like cotton bolls emerged. The smoke puffs increased and grew larger and larger, turning into gray smoke, which soon merged into one, as if a major earthquake or fire had occurred on the island. The smoke and fire spiraled and intertwined into the air. Soon, the sea turned gray and the sky turned gray. If you want to test the accuracy of our artillery, just look at Shuyu, a lonely little island in the middle of the sea, as small as a pebble! It is the eye of the Chiang army extending in front of Little Jinmen, but it is too small, and if the sunlight is too strong, a flash of your eye, you can hardly find this small island in the waves. But shell after shell, each one accurately hit the target, and the small island was submerged in thick smoke in an instant. The sound of cannons rose from all directions, and the deep rumbling sound gathered into a ball and rolled on the sea for a long time. Flames flickered, and shells burst.
    If at such a moment, you stand on this rock in Xiamen, facing the turbulent sea, you will naturally feel that the entire powerful motherland behind you is embracing you, supporting you. You will understand how closely related to you are the raging flames of iron and steel smelting that illuminate the entire night sky on the long journey from Beijing for ten thousand miles; you will understand how closely related to you are the crowds of people deep-plowing the fields under the fluttering colorful flags, from dawn to night, and from night to dawn; you will feel the eyes of hundreds of millions of people constantly gazing at the front line and their throbbing hearts. At this time, a truly noble sense of heroism rises in your heart. On the Fujian front, these countless days and nights are so full of heroism, truly the sky wind and sea waves, the ambition of people is higher than the sky wind, stronger than the sea waves. Countless naval heroes shine like stars in battle. A small torpedo boat, attacking at night, broke through the raging waves alone, braving the flying bullets and fire, and suddenly rushed into the enemy's fleet and sank the enemy ship; the heroic people and the heroic troops are integrated into one. The common people, men and women, adults and children, all become the supply troops of the fighting troops, and even under artillery fire, groups of them jump into the position and fight alongside the soldiers. Here, everything: every battle, every drop of blood and sweat, every spark, every piece of shrapnel, is permeated with heroism, shines with strange brilliance, and profoundly illustrates: the solemn punishment of the Chinese people for those who betray the motherland. Yesterday was an even-numbered day, and Liu Anqi of the Chiang army just flew to Jinmen to replace Hu Lian's position. Today is an odd-numbered day, and nearly 20,000 shells shook Jinmen. Of course, what was shaken was not only Jinmen, but the whole world. For Eisenhower and Dulles, the noose was pulled tighter, and for the vast number of people, as the Indian "Lightning" Weekly said: The entire Asia and Africa are proud of us for not being intimidated by Dulles's intimidation. Let this precious pride rise to the sky like the morning sun and shine all over the earth! Look, isn't this Jinmen Islands, shaken by explosions and covered by gunpowder smoke today, a portrayal of the tragic end of imperialism? The heroes of the Fujian front are fighting more and more bravely. The sound of cannons rumbled on the sea from noon to afternoon, from afternoon to early night,...

    万炮震金门
    ——福建前线速写之一
    刘白羽
    11月3日是个晴朗的日子。早晨，我到达厦门前沿山峰阵地上。海上一碧万顷，大金门岛还沉没在雾中，小金门岛上连一个人影都没有。
    头一天夜晚，我军福建前线司令部对金门群岛军民公开地发出广播：
      “金门群岛军民同胞们注意：今日，11月2号，是个双日，我们一炮未打，你们得到补给。明日，11月3号，是个单日，你们千万不要出来，注意！注意！”
    蒋介石部队果然严格遵守命令，收听广播后，就赶紧把舰船都从料罗湾上撤走了。这时大海显得如此空寂，只有海面的波光在粼粼闪动。但我知道，时针在向前跃动，一切都在等待着一个已经决定的时刻的到来。战士们的手也许握紧了大炮的升降轮，也许正把炮弹拭擦了一遍又一遍。我想起不过十几天前，在国外，和几位亚洲非洲的朋友解释着，他们所热情关怀、而又感到“神奇莫解”的台湾海峡战争，为什么是帝国主义的绞索这个问题。而现在我自己亲身在这儿感受着这战争史上前所未有的崭新的一页了。我听着一位高级指挥员在电话上回答问题：“不要碰那个塔，塔是个古迹。将来我们去了还要好好看一看呢！对准军事目标打，民房和营房不要打！烟太大，等烟消了，看准目标再打！”
    我得利用炮还没打响的时刻，细细体会一下这新的战争生活。年青的海军战士，穿着海蓝的军服，披着白色的翻领，在地图板上做着复杂的作业，聪明的眼光，闪出胜利的信心。我是住过朝鲜前线的坑道的，而这里的坑道像整洁的街道，不必弯腰就可以走过去，坑顶上亮着电灯，墙壁上安装了木板，坑道口的墙报上贴满战士有着海一般宽阔胸怀、太阳一般炽热的感情的诗篇。交通沟胸墙上密密麻麻布满电话线，使你想到人身上复杂而灵敏的神经中枢。使我惊喜的是当我从了望孔回过头时，忽然看到我所熟识的一位同志站在眼前，他那双大眼睛一闪笑了。他就是我们在东北冰天雪地，三下江南时，最早派去掌握炮兵的人。那时敌人炮火还占着绝对优势，那时，我们从荒山野地里一件一件寻找着日本军队遗失的火炮零件，我们就这样凭着自己双手，从无到有，在激烈斗争中，建设起我们如此强大的炮兵。还是让挨炮的人公允地去评价我们炮火的威力吧！这也是东风压倒西风的一个例证。
    美帝国主义在派兵侵入中近东后，又在台湾海峡玩火，蒋介石军队也用炮火向我挑衅，从8月23日开始我们对他们进行炮火惩罚。金门蒋军立刻惊呼起来：“炮弹像下暴雨一样啊！”“我们的兵舰起火了！”果然，蒋军一只美字号舰炸成两段，现在，还躺在料罗湾水面上。在这时，他们张惶失措了，他们不能不提出问题：“我们的美国朋友呢？”23日开始炮击，恰好24日是联合国讨论美英侵入黎巴嫩、约旦的大会闭幕的一天，一波未平，一波又起，大家都指着杜勒斯的鼻子骂他，他想燃起战争火焰吓人，结果他却一下子被全世界人民愤怒的烈火浓烟包围了。站立起来的中国人民从来不怕美帝国主义，而且双手抓紧套在美帝国主义脖颈上的绞索，华尔街的“绅士”们脖颈上套上一根绞索当然不大体面，不过绞索既然是自己套上的，那么绞索勒紧的滋味，也就只好由他们自己去尝受吧！
    大金门岛港口由雾中显露出来。时间到了！指挥员看着表，发出“预备！”的口令。我听到电话中传出炮阵地上传达口令的声音：“预备！……”然后戛然静止，一点声息都没有了，最后，指挥员昂起头来喊了一声：“放！”
    为了看清炮击全景，我跑到坑道外面的交通壕里。一片明镜的大海，一片耀眼的阳光，突然像千万火花迸跳，各处闪亮了白色的闪光，万弹齐发，排空而去。我定睛看准小金门岛，原来那里寂然不动，一下，这里那里，冒出一小朵一小朵棉花桃似的发亮的白烟团。烟团愈增愈多，愈涨愈大，变为灰色浓烟，浓烟很快汇合成一片，就像岛上发生了大地震、大火灾，烟和火腾空旋卷缠绕，不久，海变为灰色，天空变为灰色。你如若测验我们炮兵的射击准确性，你只看看那孤另另荡在大海之中，小得像块小石头的鼠屿吧！它是蒋军伸到小金门前面的眼睛，但它太小了，如若阳光太强烈，一闪眼，你简直在海涛中就找不到这小岛了。但是一弹一弹，弹弹都准确地命中了，小岛一时之间给浓烟湮没了。炮声从四面八方升起，深沉的轰隆声聚作一团在海面上久久地滚动着，火光在闪烁，炮弹在崩裂。
    如果你在这样时刻，立足于厦门这一处山岩上，面对着汹涌澎湃的海洋。你就会自然而然感到你背后整个强大的祖国在拥抱着你，在支持着你。你会明白：从北京而来那万里长途上，照红整个夜空的炼铁炼钢的熊熊火焰，都和你有着多么亲切的关系；你会明白：从黎明到夜晚，又从夜晚到黎明，在飘扬的彩旗下是深翻耕地的人群，每一分努力都和你有着多么密切的关系；你会感到亿万人民时刻凝视着前线的眼光和那跃动的心，在这时，你心中升起一种真正崇高的英雄主义的感情。在福建前线这无数日日夜夜，正是这样充满了英雄气息，真是天风海涛，人的志气比天风高，比海涛壮。无数海军英雄在战斗中像星星一样明亮发光，一只小小鱼雷快艇，夜间出击，独自冲破惊涛骇浪，冒着纷飞弹火，一下突入敌人舰群之中将敌舰击沉；英雄的人民和英雄的部队结成一体，老百姓，连男带女，连大人带小孩都成为战斗部队的辎重兵，甚至在炮火下，一群一群跳进阵地和战士们一道作战。在这里这一切：每一次战斗，每一滴血汗，每一星火花，每一片弹片，都渗透了英雄主义，都闪着奇异的光彩，都深刻说明：中国人民对于叛逆祖国的人的庄严的惩罚。昨天是个双日，蒋军的刘安琪刚刚飞到金门来接替胡琏的职位，今天是个单日，近两万发炮弹震动了金门。当然震动的不只是金门，震动的是全世界，对艾森豪威尔，杜勒斯来说是绞索拉得更紧了，对广大人民来说，正如印度“闪电”周报所说：整个亚洲和非洲对我们未被杜勒斯的恫吓吓倒而感到自豪。让这可珍贵的自豪心像早晨的太阳一样升上天空，照遍大地吧！请看，今日这为爆炸所震动，为硝烟所遮没的金门群岛，不就是帝国主义在悲惨下场的写照吗？福建前线的英雄们愈战愈勇，炮声从中午到下午，从下午到初夜，一直在海面上轰隆隆地响着，……
