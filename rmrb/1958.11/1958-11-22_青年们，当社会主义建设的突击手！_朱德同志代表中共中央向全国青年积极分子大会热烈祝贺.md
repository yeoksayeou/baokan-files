Xinhua News Agency, November 21st: Speech by Comrade Zhu De, Vice-Chairman of the CPC Central Committee, at the Second National Congress of Active Youth in Socialist Construction. The full text is as follows: Comrades:

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I extend warm congratulations to the young activists in the socialist construction of our great motherland, and to the young people across the country on all fronts of socialist construction.

The holding of this National Congress of Active Youth in Socialist Construction coincides with a time when the socialist construction of our motherland has achieved unprecedented and great victories. After the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, under the guidance of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our country has witnessed a comprehensive leap forward in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture this year. People's communes have been basically realized in rural areas across the country. Under the leadership of the Party, our country’s 500 million peasants have displayed soaring enthusiasm, enabling our country to achieve a great victory of doubling grain production. In recent months, the working class and the broad masses of the people have launched a vigorous mass movement to develop iron and steel production. This unprecedented great mass movement not only ensures that our country's steel production this year will be doubled on the basis of last year, but also greatly strengthens the strong will of our people to build socialism, promotes the spirit of hard work and thrift in building the country, and promotes the development of the entire industrial production. On the scientific and cultural fronts, there has also been great development recently. The policy of combining education with productive labor has achieved remarkable results. In short, everyone can see that our great socialist motherland, like the rising sun, is leaping forward at a revolutionary high speed.

The current task of the people of the whole country is to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and prepare conditions for the future transition from socialism to communism. We must, through the social organizational form of people's communes, gradually transition the socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people. To this end, we must develop our country's industry and agriculture at high speed, industrialize the whole country, industrialize the people's communes, and factory-ize agriculture. In the field of science and culture, we must also reach the world's most advanced level. By that time, it will be possible for us to gradually eliminate the serious differences between industry and agriculture, cities and villages, mental and physical labor, and it will be possible for us to gradually transition from socialism to communism. That is to say, the "Great Harmony World" that mankind has longed for for thousands of years, the communist ideal that communists have struggled for for more than a hundred years, will be possible for your generation to realize with your own hands.

Building socialism is a great and glorious historical task, which requires the hard work of the people of the whole country, and also requires young people to play a shock role in this great and glorious cause. In this year's Great Leap Forward, many young people, under the leadership of the Party, have shown the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and the communist labor attitude of not caring about remuneration, not talking about conditions, and working day and night. This valuable communist spirit is an important reason why our socialist construction can achieve great achievements in a very short period of time. This noble communist spirit must continue to be developed. However, young people must never be complacent because of this. We must see that the achievements we have achieved today are still far from the standards required to build socialism and the highest ideals of communism in the future. Many new problems and many difficult tasks are before us. In order not to lose our way, not to become unrealistic dreamers, and to avoid making major mistakes, everyone must strive to master the theoretical weapon of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, learn cultural, scientific and technological knowledge more quickly, learn better from the workers, peasants, and revolutionary predecessors, and constantly sum up experience in complex social struggles and struggles against nature, and strive to combine revolutionary enthusiasm with the spirit of seeking truth from facts. Next year will be the decisive year of "three years of hard work to fundamentally change the face of the motherland," and industrial and agricultural production must continue to grow exponentially. It is hoped that the youth of the whole country will continue to work with the people of the whole country to strive for greater victories.

The Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao place the greatest hope on you young people. The future of our great motherland is infinitely bright, and your future is infinitely bright, just like Chairman Mao said: "The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the final analysis, it is up to you. You young people are vigorous and are in a period of prosperity, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Hope is placed on you." In order to overthrow the old world and build a new world, young people must have the determination to make the most thorough break with the various ideas of the bourgeoisie, and train themselves into people with a high degree of communist ideological consciousness and moral qualities, and become a new generation that closely combines physical and mental labor, regards labor as the first need in life, and strives to learn, and strives to climb the highest peak of world science.

Comrades, the main content of our era is the transition from capitalism to socialism, which was started by the great October Socialist Revolution. The characteristic of the current international situation is that the East wind prevails over the West wind, and continues to prevail over the West wind. Over the past year, the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has grown new and greatly, the national independence movement has developed further, and the peace movement of the people of the world has been further strengthened, while the imperialist camp headed by the United States is declining. After the U.S. imperialism suffered setbacks in its aggression in the Middle East, it launched war provocations in the Taiwan Strait region of our country, which aroused great anger among the people of our country. The people of our country are determined to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu. This is our country's internal affair, and no U.S. imperialism is allowed to interfere. The people of our country love peace, but are not afraid of war. If U.S. imperialism dares to impose war on our heads, the anger of our 650 million people will surely burn it to ashes.

Comrades, the task of building socialism is before us, the spirit of communism is inspiring us, the youth of the whole country are united with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, hold high the banner of victory, and bravely move forward!

    青年们，当社会主义建设的突击手！
    朱德同志代表中共中央向全国青年积极分子大会热烈祝贺
    全国人民现阶段的任务，就是要鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义，并且为将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义准备条件。我们要经过人民公社这种社会组织形式，使社会主义的集体所有制逐步地过渡到社会主义的全民所有制。为此，就要高速度地发展我国的工业和农业，使全国工业化，人民公社工业化，农业工厂化，在科学文化事业方面，也要达到世界上最先进的水平。
    新华社21日讯　中共中央副主席朱德同志在第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的讲话。全文如下：同志们：
    我代表中国共产党中央委员会，向我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设中的青年积极分子，向在社会主义建设的各个战线上的全国青年，致热烈的祝贺。
    这次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会举行的时候，正是我们祖国的社会主义建设事业，获得空前伟大胜利的时候。经过整风运动和反右派斗争以后，在党中央和毛主席提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的照耀下，今年，我们的国家，在政治、经济、文化各个方面出现了全面的大跃进。全国农村已经基本上实现了人民公社化。我国五亿农民在党的领导下，发挥了冲天的干劲，使我国取得了粮食增产一倍的伟大胜利。最近几个月来，我国工人阶级和广大人民在一起，开展了轰轰烈烈的大办钢铁的群众运动，这一史无前例的伟大的群众运动，不仅使我国今年钢铁的产量有充分把握在去年的基础上翻一番，而且大大锻炼了我国人民建设社会主义的坚强意志，发扬了我国人民的艰苦奋斗勤俭建国的精神，促进了整个工业生产的发展。在科学和文化的战线上，最近期间也有了很大的发展。教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，已经取得了显著的效果。总之，大家可以看到，我们伟大的社会主义祖国，有如旭日初升，正在以革命的高速度向前跃进。
    全国人民现阶段的任务，就是要鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义，并且为将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义准备条件。我们要经过人民公社这种社会组织形式，使社会主义的集体所有制逐步地过渡到社会主义的全民所有制。为此，就要高速度地发展我国的工业和农业，使全国工业化，人民公社工业化，农业工厂化，在科学文化事业方面，也要达到世界上最先进的水平。到了那时，我们就有可能逐步地消灭工业和农业、城市和乡村、脑力劳动和体力劳动的严重差别，就有可能逐步地由社会主义过渡到共产主义。这就是说，人类向往了几千年的“大同世界”，共产主义者为之奋斗了一百多年的共产主义理想，将有可能在你们这一代亲手使它实现了。
    建设社会主义是一个伟大、光荣的历史任务，需要全国人民的艰苦奋斗，也需要青年在这个伟大、光荣的事业中起突击的作用。在今年的大跃进中，许多青年在党的领导下，表现出敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，和不计报酬、不讲条件、夜以继日的共产主义劳动态度。这种可贵的共产主义精神，是使得我们的社会主义建设事业，能够在极短的时间内，取得巨大的成就的重要原因。必须继续发挥这种崇高的共产主义精神。但是，青年们绝对不能因此而骄傲自满。必须看到，我们今天已经达到的成就，同建成社会主义所要求的标准和将来共产主义的最高理想相比，还相差很远。摆在我们面前的是许许多多新的问题，许许多多艰难的工作。为着不致迷失方向，不致成为不切实际的空想家，避免犯大的错误，大家必须努力掌握马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的理论武器，更快地学习文化科学技术知识，更好地向工农群众和革命前辈学习，在复杂的社会斗争和向自然斗争中不断地总结经验，力求把革命的热情同实事求是的精神结合起来。明年是“苦战三年，基本改变祖国面貌”的具有决定性的一年，工农业生产必须继续有成倍的增长。希望全国青年继续和全国人民一道，为争取更大的胜利而斗争。
    中国共产党和毛主席把最大的希望寄托在你们青年的身上。我们伟大祖国的前途是无限光明的，你们的前途也是无限光明的，正如毛主席说的：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”为着推翻旧的世界，建设一个新世界，青年人要有决心同资产阶级形形色色的思想作最彻底的决裂，把自己锻炼成为具有高度的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质的人，并且成为体力劳动和脑力劳动密切结合起来的新的一代，把劳动看成生活中的第一需要，并且努力学习，力求攀登世界科学的最高峰。
    同志们，我们时代的主要内容是由伟大十月社会主义革命所开始的从资本主义向社会主义过渡，当前国际形势的特点是东风压倒西风，而且继续压倒西风。一年来，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量有了新的巨大的增长，民族独立运动有了更大的发展，全世界人民的和平运动有了进一步的加强，而以美国为首的帝国主义阵营则日趋没落。美帝国主义在中东的侵略碰壁以后，又在我国台湾海峡地区进行战争挑衅，引起了我国人民的巨大愤怒。我国人民是一定要解放台、澎、金、马的，这是我国的内政，决不允许美帝国主义干涉。我国人民是爱好和平的，但也不怕战争。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争加在我们头上，我们六亿五千万人民的怒火，一定要把它烧为灰烬。
    同志们，建设社会主义的任务摆在我们面前，共产主义的精神在鼓舞着我们，全国青年同全国人民团结在一起，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，高举起胜利的旗帜，奋勇前进！
