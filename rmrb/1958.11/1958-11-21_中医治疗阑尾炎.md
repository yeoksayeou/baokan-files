Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment of Appendicitis
    Physician Zhang Xu, Employee Hospital of Jiapigou Gold Mine, Huadian, Jilin

    Editor's Note: Many readers have written to inquire about the treatment of appendicitis with traditional Chinese medicine. We are publishing Comrade Zhang Xu's article here as a response.

    I used to be an orthopedic surgeon and had little contact with the medical treatment of appendicitis in the past. Jiapigou is a remote place, and due to the limitations of technology and equipment, our hospital had no other option for appendicitis patients except to send them by special car to the Huadian County Hospital, more than 190 miles away, for surgery. Patients suffered greatly, and sometimes their lives were even in danger. Therefore, I had the idea of using Chinese medicine to cure this disease. I started exploring this area in 1953.

    First, I consulted with Western medicine doctors to understand some basic issues of appendicitis, and then I delved into the relevant issues in traditional Chinese medicine theory. I repeatedly and carefully studied classic Chinese medicine works such as "Synopsis of the Golden Chamber," "Complete Works of Surgical Medicine," "Inner Canon of Medicine," and "Six Subject Guidelines," and other related literature, and clarified that appendicitis is a type of "intestinal carbuncle" recorded in Chinese medicine books, called "shrinking foot intestinal pain." As for treatment methods, traditional Chinese medicine had detailed records as early as the Qin and Han dynasties more than 2,000 years ago. For example, "Synopsis of the Golden Chamber" proposed using Da Huang Mu Dan Tang (Rhubarb and Moutan Decoction) to treat intestinal carbuncle. Since then, countless medical workers have continuously verified it in medical practice and enriched its experience. I followed the arguments in the literature and treated it in the following three steps:

    One, Acupuncture and Cupping: The stimulation points are acupoints such as "Zhongting" (Center Courtyard), "Shenzhu" (Body Pillar), and "Lingtai" (Spirit Tower). Use a three-edged needle to pierce the muscle (one fen deep), and then use a fire jar to draw out blood. The patient immediately felt comfortable in the abdomen, and vomiting and chills disappeared. This method is suitable for patients with combined symptoms, who often have severe abdominal pain and vomiting. Failure to use this method will affect treatment and medication.

    Two, Taking "Da Huang Mu Dan Pi Tang" (Rhubarb, Moutan Bark Decoction): The first dose is 400 cc. About two to five hours after taking it, the patient will excrete thin and loose stools, and the pain in the lower right abdomen will gradually reduce. Take the second dose (about 300 cc) every six to twelve hours. There is still diarrhea after taking it. Take the third dose (300 cc) every six or twelve hours. At this time, the total number of stools can reach more than ten times. The pain in the patient's right abdomen gradually disappears, and the pulse becomes more moderate, but there is still a dull pain in the entire abdomen.

    Three, Taking "Jia Wei Bai Jiang Tang" (Modified Patrinia Decoction): Take 300 cc each time, a total of three to five times, with an interval of six to twelve hours each time. Most patients can recover after taking it. If there is still local pain, "Da Huang Tang" (Rhubarb Decoction) and "Bai Jiang Tang" (Patrinia Decoction) can be used alternately (use "Da Huang Tang" in the morning and "Bai Jiang Tang" in the afternoon). Individual patients may experience pain in the entire abdomen but not in the appendix after taking Da Huang Tang. This is caused by the cold nature of "Da Huang" (Rhubarb). If you take "Bai Jiang Tang" (Patrinia Decoction) at this time, the pain can disappear.

    The same is true for appendicitis patients, but due to different physical conditions and different degrees of illness, it is very important to differentiate the syndrome and treat it accordingly and use it flexibly. For example, if the patient does not have combined symptoms such as vomiting or severe pain when admitted to the hospital, there is no need to perform acupuncture and cupping, and just take Chinese medicine directly. Furthermore, most patients are not accustomed to taking 300 to 400 milliliters of decoction at a time, and they feel distressed when drinking it. Therefore, during the clinical trial stage at Changchun Municipal Hospital, I also tried the method of concentrated medicinal juice. Under the principle that the original dose remains unchanged, the amount of medicinal juice is concentrated to half of the original amount, and the effect is the same.

    In order to be responsible to the patients and avoid misdiagnosis, it is very important to obtain the cooperation and help of Western medicine doctors. In the past few years, this is what I have done: after the patient is admitted to the hospital and diagnosed by Western medicine as acute, subacute, or chronic appendicitis, and it is determined by TCM consultation to be an indication, they are transferred to the TCM treatment area and treated with TCM.

    We have treated a total of 466 cases of appendicitis with traditional Chinese medicine, of which 18 cases relapsed, and the rest have achieved significant curative effects. This method is simple and economical, costing five to ten yuan and taking about five to seven days to recover, and the patient's pain is also reduced. But is this method 100% perfect? It is still worth continuing to study and improve. I am willing to work with TCM colleagues across the country under the leadership of the Party to continue our efforts to gradually enrich and improve it from theory to practice.

### 中医治疗阑尾炎

    中医治疗阑尾炎
    吉林桦甸夹皮沟金矿职工医院医师　张旭
    编者按：不少读者来信询问中医治疗阑尾炎的事。这里特地发表张旭同志的文章，作为答复。
    我原来是个外科正骨医，过去很少接触阑尾炎的医疗工作。夹皮沟是个偏僻的地方，由于技术和设备条件的限制，我们医院对阑尾炎患者除了用专车送到一百九十多里路以外桦甸县立医院动手术以外，没有其它办法，患者受到极大的痛苦，有时甚至发生生命危险。于是我产生了用中药去治好这种病的念头。从1953年开始，我就在这方面进行摸索。
    我首先向西医同志了解阑尾炎的一些基本问题，然后再深入钻研中医理论方面的有关问题。我反复精读了“金匮要略”、“疡医大全”、“内经”、“六科准绳”等中医经典著作和其他有关文献，明确了阑尾炎就是中医书上记载的“肠痈”的一种称之为“缩脚肠痛”。至于治疗方法，祖国医学早在二千多年以前的秦汉时代就有了详细的记载。如“金匮要略”中就提出用大黄牡丹汤治肠痈，其后无数的医务工作者又在医疗实践上不断地加以证实，更丰富了它的经验。我就根据着文献中的论据，按照下面三个步骤进行治疗：
    一、扎针拔火罐：刺激点是“中庭”“身柱”“灵台”等穴道，用三棱针刺入肌肉（深一分），然后用火罐拔出血。患者当时感到腹内痛快，呕吐、恶寒随之消失。这个方法适用于有合并症状的患者，他们往往腹痛剧烈，服药呕吐，不采用这种办法就会影响治疗和服药。
    二、服“大黄牡丹皮汤”：第一次服四百C．C．，服后约二至五小时，患者就排泄稀薄大便，右下腹部疼痛逐渐减轻。隔六至十二小时服第二次（约三百C．C．），服后仍然腹泻。再隔六或十二小时服第三次（三百C．C．），这时总计大便泻下可达十余次。患者右腹部疼痛渐渐消失，脉象趋于和缓，只是全腹部仍有隐痛现象。
    三、服“加味败酱汤”：每次服三百C．C．，共服三至五次，每次间断为六至十二小时。多数患者服完后就能痊愈。如果仍然有局部按痛感觉，可采用“大黄汤”和“败酱汤”交替使用（上午用“大黄汤”，下午用“败酱汤”）。个别患者在服用大黄汤以后，全腹部作痛而阑尾部不痛，这是“大黄”寒凉性质引起的。此时若服用“败酱汤”，疼痛就可以消失。
    同样是阑尾炎患者，但由于体质不同，病情程度不同，所以辩证论治，灵活运用是很主要的。比如患者入院当时没有呕吐或剧痛等合并症状时，就不必扎针拔罐子，直接服中药就可以了。再如，多数病者不习惯一次服三至四百毫升的汤药，喝起来很苦恼，所以我在长春市立医院临床试点阶段，又试用了浓缩药汁的办法，在原方剂量不变的原则下，把药汁数量浓缩成原量的一半，效果一样。
    为了对患者认真负责避免误诊，取得西医同志的配合帮助是很重要的。几年来，我是这样作的：患者入院，经西医协助检查，确诊为急性、亚急性或慢性阑尾炎以后，通过中医会诊，确定为适应症时，就转入中医疗区，用中药来治疗。
    我们用中药共治疗阑尾炎四百六十六例，其中有十八例复发外，其余均收到了显著的疗效。这个方法简便，又很经济，花五至十元，约五至七天即可痊愈，病人痛苦也减少。但这个方法是否百分之一百圆满呢？还值得继续钻研和改进。我愿意和全国中医同志一起在党的领导下，继续努力，使它从理论到实践逐渐丰富和提高。
