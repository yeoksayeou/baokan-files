Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram on November 15th to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Chile, congratulating them on the 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Chile to be held from the 18th to the 23rd. The telegram is as follows: To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Chile and to all comrades of the 11th National Congress of the Communist Party of Chile:

　　On the occasion of the convening of the 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Chile, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China, extends warm and fraternal congratulations to your Congress.

　　Your party has experienced a long, tortuous, and glorious road of struggle. In the past thirty-six years, your party, under all circumstances, has fought unyieldingly to defend Chile's national independence, safeguard the democratic freedoms of the Chilean people, and strive for the improvement of the Chilean people's lives. Your party is worthy of being the most loyal defender of the interests of the Chilean nation and people, and worthy of being the advanced force of the Chilean working class and working people.

　　The Communist Party of China feels infinite excitement and encouragement at the achievements made by the Communist Party of Chile in its past struggles.

　　At present, U.S. imperialism is still stepping up its arms race and expanding its aggression. It has carried out armed intervention in the Middle East, and is also carrying out military provocations against China, while at the same time doing everything possible to plunder the resources of Chile and other Latin American countries, and interfere in their internal affairs. The aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism, which are hostile to the people of the world, must be smashed, and can also be smashed. In this new situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, where socialist forces are flourishing, the consciousness of workers in imperialist countries is increasing day by day, and the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing vigorously, as long as the people of all countries unite and struggle hard, they will certainly be able to defeat U.S. imperialism and achieve the final victory of the struggle.

　　Your party is now holding its 11th Congress openly after a long period of underground struggle, which is of great significance. We congratulate your party's Congress on its complete success; congratulate you on making new progress in the struggle against modern revisionism and defending the principles of Marxism-Leninism, in the struggle to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and expand democratic forces; and congratulate you on uniting all patriotic and democratic forces to defend Chile's national independence, safeguard the people's democratic freedoms, strive to improve the people's lives, and on achieving greater success in strengthening the unity of the people of Latin American countries to oppose the common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

    中共中央电贺智共代表大会
    新华社17日讯　中国共产党中央委员会15日致电智利共产党中央委员会，祝贺智利共产党将于18日至23日召开的第十一次代表大会。电文如下：智利共产党中央委员会并转智利共产党第十一次全国代表大会全体同志们：
    值此智利共产党召开第十一次代表大会之际，中国共产党中央委员会代表中国共产党全体党员，谨向你们的代表大会致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    你们的党经历了长远的、曲折的、光荣的斗争道路。在过去三十六年当中，你们的党不论在任何情况下，都是不屈不挠地为着捍卫智利的民族独立，维护智利人民的民主自由和争取智利人民的生活改善而斗争。你们的党不愧为智利民族和人民利益的最忠诚的保卫者，不愧为智利工人阶级和劳动人民的先进部队。
    中国共产党对于智利共产党在以往的斗争中所取得的成就感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。
    目前，美帝国主义还在加紧备战和扩大侵略。它武装干涉了中东，又对中国进行武力挑衅，同时千方百计地掠夺智利和拉丁美洲其他各国的资源，干涉它们的内政。美帝国主义与世界人民为敌的侵略政策和战争政策是必须加以粉碎，而且也是能够粉碎的。在这东风压倒西风的新形势下，在社会主义力量蒸蒸日上、帝国主义各国的工人觉悟日益提高和亚洲、非洲以及拉丁美洲各国民族解放运动猛烈地发展的情形下，只要各国人民团结一致，努力斗争，就一定能够击败美帝国主义，而取得斗争的最后胜利。
    你们党在经过漫长的地下斗争之后，现在公开举行第十一次代表大会，这具有重大的意义。我们祝贺你们党的代表大会圆满成功；祝贺你们在反对现代修正主义、捍卫马列主义原则的斗争中，在为进一步巩固工农联盟与扩大民主力量的斗争中，取得新的进展；祝贺你们在团结一切爱国民主力量为保卫智利的民族独立、维护人民的民主自由、争取改善人民生活以及在加强拉丁美洲各国人民的团结来反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，取得更大的成就。
          中国共产党中央委员会
