The British Channel Tunnel Company, founded nearly eighty years ago, was originally a tunnel construction company in name only, having never actually dug a tunnel. Founded during the time of Napoleon III, it possessed 456,750 shares priced at four shillings each. In 1955, the shares of the British Channel Tunnel Company fell to eleven pence each. However, in the second half of 1957, the company's share price soared, reaching nine shillings per share. At the beginning of 1958, the book "The Channel Tunnel," published in Britain, also attracted public attention. Recently, the Channel Tunnel has become an even more popular topic.

The century-old legend of the Channel Tunnel has been rekindled, but what exactly is going on?

	Old Story Revisited

As early as a century and a half ago, it was suggested that a Channel Tunnel be built to connect the British Isles with continental Europe. In 1802, the French army engineer Mathieu proposed to Napoleon the construction of an undersea tunnel to invade Britain.

Mathieu's plan was not realized. However, since then, the idea of building a Channel Tunnel has been repeatedly brought up, and some companies have been established to attempt its construction.

British military figures have always opposed the construction of such a tunnel. They fear that the Channel Tunnel could become a route for invasion of Britain from continental Europe. On October 22, 1957, British Field Marshal Montgomery even stated in a speech: "Strategically speaking, the Channel Tunnel would weaken Britain's position. Building the Channel Tunnel is a dangerous plan. I am completely opposed to it."

Due to the exorbitant construction costs and the opposition of British military figures, the Channel Tunnel plan has been repeatedly shelved.

  Triangular Contest

Since Britain, in order to counter the exclusion of the "European Common Market" against Britain, actively advocated the so-called "European Free Trade Area," Britain has developed a great interest in the old problem of the Channel Tunnel, believing that the successful construction of the Channel Tunnel would greatly benefit Britain's trade and transport with continental Europe, thereby countering the expansion of American monopoly capital. Since 1956, British officials have constantly expressed the view that the Channel Tunnel is beneficial to the British economy. British military figures, apart from Field Marshal Montgomery, have also changed their tune, believing that the Channel Tunnel is beneficial to military "cooperation" between Britain and Western European countries.

When the Channel Tunnel issue was rekindled in Britain, French monopoly capital groups felt panic. The construction of the Channel Tunnel was initiated by the French, and the tunnel's end would be in France; France would "naturally not yield." The French Tunnel Company had long been prepared to carry out the construction of the Channel Tunnel and strongly opposed British control.

The British Channel Tunnel Company only has a capital of 91,351 pounds, while the construction of this 22-mile-long Channel Tunnel is estimated to require at least 100 million pounds. Therefore, the partnership between British and French monopoly capital is imperative. In July 1956, Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, and in November of the same year, the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt failed. The old Suez Canal Company, controlled by British and French monopoly capital, decided to invest in the construction of the Channel Tunnel.

American monopoly capitalists, in order to strengthen their control over Europe, are of course unwilling to "stand idly by" regarding the construction of the Channel Tunnel. American monopoly capitalists have repeatedly expressed great interest in the construction of the Channel Tunnel. Britain was unwilling for American monopoly capitalists to get involved in this matter and reacted coldly. However, eager American monopoly capitalists directly announced in New York in April 1957 the establishment of a "Technical Research Corporation" specializing in the research of constructing the Channel Tunnel, and planning the funding for the construction of the tunnel. After the establishment of the "Technical Research Corporation," British monopoly capitalists were greatly disturbed, and the chairman of the British Channel Tunnel Company, Delange, hurriedly hinted at the company's shareholders' meeting in May 1957 that the Americans should be patient, saying, "It would be wise to cooperate with the Americans at the appropriate time."

British and French monopoly capitalists hastily established a Channel Tunnel Research Group to accelerate the Channel Tunnel construction plan, in order to prevent further penetration by American monopoly capital. The funding for this group was 100,000 pounds. The British Channel Tunnel Company, the French Channel Tunnel Company, and the old Suez Canal Company each contributed 30,000 pounds. In order not to overly offend American monopoly capitalists, the American "Technical Research Corporation" was also permitted to contribute 10,000 pounds. From the second half of 1957, the Channel Tunnel Research Group actively engaged in activities.

	Official and Merchant Alike

After the establishment of the Channel Tunnel Research Group, the struggle for the Channel Tunnel among British, French, and American monopoly capital ostensibly eased. However, the British and French sides were deeply wary of the United States, so in the personnel deployment of the Channel Tunnel Research Group, they did not hesitate to expose the original features of monopoly capitalists who are both officials and merchants, and selected the most capable personnel. The Channel Tunnel Research Group stipulated that the British and French sides would each send one person to serve as chairman, and Americans could not serve as chairman. The British chairman was the former Permanent Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Kirkpatrick, and the French chairman was the former French Ambassador to Britain, Massigli. At the same time, France also dispatched the advocate of "European Atomic Union," the famous investment activist Louis Armand, to participate in the work of the Channel Tunnel Research Group.

The research report of the Channel Tunnel Research Group will be submitted before the end of December. Based on this report, the location of the tunnel, the construction plan, the start date... will be determined. The temporarily eased Channel Tunnel battle will soon unfold further.

    英吉利海峡隧道争夺战
    乐山
    成立迄今将近八十余年的英国海峡隧道公司，本来是一个虚有其名而没有开凿过一条隧道的隧道开凿公司。该公司成立于拿破仑三世时期，拥有每股价格为四先令的股票四十五万六千七百五十张。1955年，英国海峡隧道公司的股票跌为每股十一个便士。可是，1957年下半年，该公司股票价格猛涨，每股价格达九先令。1958年年初，英国出版的“海峡隧道”一书，也引起了公众的注意。最近，海峡隧道更成了一个流行的话题。
    百年来的英吉利海峡隧道传说，死灰复燃，究竟是怎么一回事？
      旧事重提
    早在一个半世纪以前，就有人建议开凿英吉利海峡隧道，以沟通英伦三岛与欧洲大陆的交通。1802年，法国陆军工程师马悌厄曾向拿破仑献策：建造海底隧道进攻英国。
    马悌厄的计划没有实现。不过，从此以后，开凿海峡隧道的事情，不断地有人提起，并且还成立了一些公司，进行了开凿的尝试。
    英国军方人士向来反对开凿这样一条隧道。他们担心海峡隧道可能成为由欧洲大陆入侵英国的一条通路。1957年10月22日，英国蒙哥马利元帅还在发表谈话说：“从战略上说，海峡隧道将削弱英国的地位。开凿海峡隧道是一个危险的计划。我完全反对。”
    由于开凿费用过于浩大，由于英国军方人士的反对，英吉利海峡隧道计划一再搁浅。
  三角斗法
    自从英国为了对抗“欧洲共同市场”对英国的排挤、积极倡导所谓“欧洲自由贸易区”以来，英国对海峡隧道的老问题发生了很大的兴趣，认为海峡隧道开凿成功，将大大有利于英国与欧洲大陆的贸易、运输，从而对抗美国垄断资本的扩张。从1956年起，英国官方人士不断发表海峡隧道有利于英国经济的言论。英国军方人士，除了蒙哥马利元帅以外，也改变了腔调，认为海峡隧道有利于英国与西欧国家的军事“合作”。
    当海峡隧道问题在英国死灰复燃的时候，法国垄断资本集团感到了恐慌。开凿海峡隧道是法国人创议的，隧道一端在法国，法国“当仁不让”。法国隧道公司早就准备进行海峡隧道的开凿，极力反对英国包办。
    英国海峡隧道公司资本只有九万一千三百五十一英镑，而开凿这条长达二十二英里的海峡隧道，估计至少需要一亿英镑。因此，英、法垄断资本的合伙势在必行。1956年7月，埃及宣布将苏伊士运河公司收归国有，同年11月，英、法侵埃失败。在英、法垄断资本控制下的旧苏伊士运河公司，决定对英吉利海峡隧道的开凿进行投资。
    美国垄断资本家为了加强对欧洲的控制，对于英吉利海峡隧道的开凿，当然不肯“袖手旁观”。美国垄断资本家早就一再表示对海峡隧道开凿很有兴趣。英国不愿意美国垄断资本家在这件事上也插一手，反应冷淡。但是，迫不及待的美国垄断资本家径自于1957年4月在纽约宣布成立了一个“技术研究公司”，专门进行开凿英吉利海峡隧道的研究，并筹划开凿隧道的经费。“技术研究公司”成立以后，英国垄断资本家大为不安，英国海峡隧道公司董事长德兰格赶紧在1957年5月该公司股东大会上，暗示美国人稍安勿躁，他说，“在适当的时候请美国人合作是明智的。”
    英、法垄断资本家匆匆成立了一个海峡隧道研究团，加速海峡隧道开凿计划，以阻止美国垄断资本更进一步的渗透。该团经费为十万英镑。英国海峡隧道公司、法国海峡隧道公司、旧苏伊士运河公司各出三万英镑。为了不过于冒犯美国垄断资本家，美国“技术研究公司”也被许可出资一万英镑。从1957年下半年起，海峡隧道研究团积极活动。
    亦官亦商
    海峡隧道研究团成立以后，英、法、美垄断资本对海峡隧道的争夺，表面上有了缓和。但是，英、法方面对美国深具戒心，因此在海峡隧道研究团的人事部署上，不惜暴露垄断资本家亦官亦商的本来面貌，选派了最得力的人手。海峡隧道研究团规定由英、法两方各派一人充任主席，美国人不得充任。英国方面的主席是前英国外交部的常务次官柯克帕特里克，法国方面的主席是前法国驻英大使马西格里。同时，法国还派遣了“欧洲原子联营”的鼓吹者、著名的投资活动家路易·阿蒙参加海峡隧道研究团的工作。
    海峡隧道研究团的研究报告，即将于12月底以前提出。根据这个报告，将确定隧道的地点、开凿计划、动工日期……。目前暂时缓和的英吉利海峡隧道争夺战，不久也将更进一步地展开。
