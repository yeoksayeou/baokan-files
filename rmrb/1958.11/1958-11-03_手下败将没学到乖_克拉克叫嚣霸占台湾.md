Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: New York News: American General Clark, who once served as the commander of the "United Nations Forces" in the American invasion of Korea, called the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which the United States was forced to do, a "sad day" in American history in a speech in New York on the evening of October 30. He also clamored that the United States must "continue to hold on to" Taiwan.

Clark said, "We did not win the war, and the day we signed the armistice (agreement) on the battlefield was a sad day in American history." But he tried to push the blame for America's failure onto the lack of support from America's vassal states.

    手下败将没学到乖
    克拉克叫嚣霸占台湾
    据新华社2日讯  纽约消息：在美国侵朝战争中曾经担任过“联合国军”司令的美国将军克拉克，10月30日晚间在纽约的一次讲话中把美国被迫在朝鲜停战协定上签字叫作美国历史上“可悲的日子”，他还叫嚣美国必须“继续保住”台湾。
    克拉克说，“我们没有打胜仗，而在战场上签订停战（协定）的日子，这是美国历史上可悲的日子。”但是他企图把美国的失败推到美国的仆从国家对美国支持不力这一点上。
