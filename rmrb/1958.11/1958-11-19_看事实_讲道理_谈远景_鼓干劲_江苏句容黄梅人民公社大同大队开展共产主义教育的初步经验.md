Looking at Facts, Reasoning, Talking About the Future, and Encouraging Enthusiasm
    ——Preliminary Experiences of the Datong Brigade of the Huangmei People's Commune in Jurong, Jiangsu, in Carrying Out Communist Education

After the establishment of the people's commune, how should political and ideological work be carried out? The Datong Brigade of the Huangmei People's Commune in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, conducted a pilot project in the Guazigou production team of two hundred and forty-three households, and gained preliminary experience, which was widely promoted throughout the brigade. This brigade greatly destroyed capitalist ideology and greatly established communist ideology, enabling the vast number of cadres and the masses to raise their awareness, clarify their direction, and strengthen their determination to take the socialist and communist road. A new situation has also emerged in all aspects of production and life.

Leaders Must Understand the Situation Philosophically
The necessity of carrying out communist education was not recognized by all cadres from the beginning. Since the superiority of the people's commune had been publicized not long ago, some people believed that it had already been publicized and there was no need for further education. They used the excuse that production was busy and there was no time to engage in ideological work. Therefore, some production teams abandoned education for individuals who were not very enthusiastic and adopted methods such as hanging signs and not allowing them to eat, which had a negative effect. The Party branch of the brigade analyzed the situation at that time and emphasized that political and ideological work is the soul of all work. If you only focus on practical matters and not on ideological matters, good things can turn into bad results. Everyone recalled that in the past few years, from mutual aid teams to elementary cooperatives, from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, the Party carried out tremendous political and ideological work at every turning point before achieving complete victory. Therefore, everyone realized that the implementation of the food supply system and the continuous improvement of people's communist consciousness and moral character are mutually reinforcing. At this time, the argument that "it has already been educated" was eliminated, and the theory of "continuous education" was established; the argument that "education and production time conflict" was eliminated, and the theory of "using the ideological to lead the practical" was established.

After solving the ideological problems of the cadres, a vigorous communist education movement was immediately launched. They used the gaps in the evenings and rainy days to carry out activities, held heart-to-heart talks and debates, and used big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, clapper talks, cartoons, slogans, dramas...all kinds of weapons were used.

First, Debate and Clarify the Cadres' Thinking
The main feature of this communist education is to closely integrate with the central work, combine with the problems existing in the management of the commune and production distribution, and discuss the ideological based on the practical. The Party branch first ascertained the ideological situation on the issue of distribution and found that there were several erroneous arguments, such as "eating without paying will produce lazy people," "radish and pork," and "supporting others," which needed to be debated clearly. After analysis, it was found that many problems existed among the cadres first. Therefore, it was decided to first debate and clarify the cadres' thinking.

Chen Zhangping, the head of the Guazigou production team and a well-to-do middle peasant, and others said: "If you have food to eat whether you work or not, people will not want to work." The brigade branch summoned all the cadres of the brigade to conduct a special forum and debate on this issue. At the meeting, Hu Wenhua, the head of the Zhangjiashang production team and a poor peasant, first criticized Chen Zhangping's statement as a manifestation of disbelief in the masses and inconsistent with the facts. He said: After the implementation of the food supply system, the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants were overjoyed. Those who were active in the past are now more active, and those who were not motivated in the past are now full of energy. Xie Enxi, the group leader of the Guazigou production team, also gave examples: Yang Mingjiang used to engage in sideline occupations outside because of overspending and did not work diligently. When he heard that food was free, he settled down at home to produce. Chen Kaifu used to be weak and had a large family, often overspending, and thought: "Anyway, whether I work or not, I will overspend, so I won't work!" Now, he said that he would have no conscience if he didn't work, and he became active too. Among the fifty-two poor peasant households in the Guazigou production team, fifty actively took the lead in production, and among the twenty-four middle peasant households, eighteen actively labored. Then, everyone pointed out that individuals who were unwilling to work existed even in the past, because there was the exploitative idea of ​​not working and gaining. It was not caused by the implementation of the food supply system. People with a bad attitude towards labor can be educated to change them.

Wang Weimin, the group leader of the Zhangjiashang production team, raised the question: "If everyone has something to eat, they won't listen to you, and it will be difficult to lead." Wang Yougen, the secretary of the Party branch, retorted that with the implementation of the food supply system, everyone put down the burden of eating, felt comfortable, and had a higher awareness. It was not difficult to lead, but easier to lead. He cited an example: "When everyone heard that the commune needed houses for canteens, warehouses, and kindergartens, they automatically gave up their houses to support the commune. Isn't this an ironclad fact?" After discussion, everyone raised their awareness and unified their understanding. People who had vague understandings before took the initiative to criticize their own wrong views and expressed their determination to do a good job.

The argument of "radish and pork" is an argument of departmentalism, saying that the conditions of one's own unit are good and the conditions of other units are poor. If they are merged into a commune, others will take advantage of them. For these people, two points are emphasized: First, don't only see that your own conditions are good and others' conditions are poor. Although the conditions are different, they all have their own advantages and disadvantages, and you should learn from each other's strengths and make up for your weaknesses. Second, you should promote communist style and oppose petty calculations. At the same time, the excuse of departmentalists that "it is not for personal gain, but also for everyone" was further refuted, pointing out that departmentalism is essentially individualism.

As for some "loss theory" people who believe that they have strong labor and few people, and that implementing free meals is "supporting others," most of them are well-to-do middle peasants, which has a very bad influence, not only confusing the understanding of the general middle peasants, who really think they are being taken advantage of, but also affecting the emotions of a small number of poor peasants, who cannot stand up straight. The brigade leadership decided to launch a key debate on this issue.

Put the Weapons in the Hands of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
Who should we rely on to refute this wrong argument? The leaders of the Datong Brigade made it clear that they should rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, especially the activists among them. This large part of the people is full of happy yearning for the people's commune, especially after the implementation of the food supply system, and sincerely thank the Party and Chairman Mao. However, they have not clearly understood why the food supply system is implemented from the principle of distribution and from the revolutionary theory. Therefore, when some people heard the news of the implementation of the food supply system, they were excited and pleasantly surprised on the one hand, and felt unreal on the other hand. When they heard the well-to-do middle peasants say things like "We support them," they seemed to feel guilty and could not clearly express their attitude. Therefore, the brigade first convened them to hold small heart-to-heart talks, attended mostly by households with weak labor and many children who had been overspending for a long time, and let them talk about their experiences with the implementation of the food supply system. Xie Enlin and his wife were relatively weak and had four children, and their lives were difficult in the past. He said that in the past, all were paid according to work, and some people were happy to eat and drink when the dividends were distributed, while he was worried at home. "A hero is most afraid of having five children," and his family had more than five people. The distributed grain was not enough to eat, but because he had been rescued by the government time and time again, he was embarrassed to talk to the cadres again. Once, he borrowed a liter of rice from a well-to-do middle peasant and was scolded. He said: "Now it's great! When I held the bowl for the first meal, I thought to myself: Chairman Mao, you have pulled out my roots of poverty!" As he spoke, tears streamed down his face. He was crying and laughing. Chen Kaifu said: "In the past, brothers divided the family, and the eldest son had something to eat, and the second son still starved; now the commune is closer than brothers, and we are jointly prosperous!" Everyone talked about a lot of heartfelt words, sincerely supported the current distribution system, and realized that free meals are a communist factor. There is no question of who supports whom. As long as you wholeheartedly work for the commune, the commune is responsible for supplying rations.

Refuting the "Loss" Theory
Then, a debate was held to refute the "loss" theory. Well-to-do middle peasants Yang Mingda and others said that this year's income was less than last year's dividend, and they "supported others" and "suffered losses." Many poor and lower-middle peasants actively criticized this wrong argument. The criticism was both ideological and practical. First, talk about long-term plans, such as the current free meals are only the first step. In the future, we will also implement free clothing, free housing, free haircuts, baths, and movies, etc. The commune plans to build residential areas, install electric lights, pave roads, and set up hospitals and cinemas... Compared with that time, what is life now? Everyone should look to the future and not only consider personal interests. Second, talk about the principle of common prosperity, pointing out that if we follow the previous distribution method, some will be sad and some will be happy, and we cannot achieve common prosperity. If we cannot achieve common prosperity, it is not pleasant for you to be a little better alone. Moreover, labor and population conditions will also change. Who can guarantee that there will be no disasters or diseases, and that labor will always be stronger than others? Everyone has an old age, and relying on work points is not as good as relying on the commune. Third, there is still a part of the current payment according to work. Wages are paid, and those who work more and better will have higher levels and can live better.

Because the debate and accounting were reasonable and based on facts, and helped to improve understanding, everyone was convinced. Especially Yang Mingda, who initially sat in the corner with an old top hat pulled down to cover half of his face, and was not in high spirits; when the meeting was dismissed, he lifted his hat, his face full of smiles, and happily said: "Reason will not be clear if you don't say it. This meeting has improved me. I will definitely work hard!" He went to work early the next morning.

Based on the simple understanding of the masses in self-education, the leaders explained the distribution policy in detail in connection with theory. Because everyone had practical feelings in the debate, everyone could accept it when they were promoted to theory. Therefore, when the distribution plan was announced, every family supported it and everyone agreed. Advocate Communist Attitude towards Labor
The masses have basically been mobilized, but the brigade leaders are not satisfied with this; they feel that some things need to be continued: First, commend model figures and set up banners. Second, mobilize everyone to make suggestions on the team's work and on the cadres, and make suggestions for improving production. The main method of airing views is to post big-character posters.

The eyes of the masses are the brightest, and they commended many activists and exposed some problems. A big-character poster depicted an old farmer sick in bed, still thinking about production in the fields. Before he was fully recovered, he went to the fields to work. Next to it was written: "Xie Xinhe, old age, fever at home, others advised him to rest quietly, he said that production cannot be lost. As soon as his condition improves, he immediately puts on his clothes and runs outside, rolls up his sleeves and takes tools to actively engage in production." Another big-character poster depicted a person who used to work in the sun and now works in the moonlight, and next to it was written: "Ji Rongfu, very good, more serious after the commune was established, worked very hard in production before, now work twelve times harder!" The criticisms in the big-character posters have facts and reasoning, and are both sharp and enthusiastic. One wrote: "Middle peasant Zhang Fangrong, not enlightened in his thinking. Pretends to be sick when working, rushes to eat. You ask why, because he doesn't record work points. Everyone comments on his thinking, capitalism is very serious. Sincerely advise Zhang Fangrong, this road will not work. Quickly keep up with the big collective, and keep active labor in mind. Socialist construction is good, and you have made contributions to sharing happiness." Through mass commendation and criticism, advanced elements are promoted, achievements are consolidated, and backward elements are helped to catch up. Everyone distinguishes right from wrong, and distinguishes fragrant from foul, and feels that progress is glorious and backwardness is shameful, forming a social atmosphere where everyone is upward and everyone is leaping forward. When mobilizing, the leaders talked about dialectics, pointing out that things are developing and people cannot be regarded as dead. Those who are not active today will correct their shortcomings tomorrow, work harder, and consolidate their progress, and they will become active. This encourages everyone to dispel their concerns, be brave to accept criticism, and use actions to show their determination. Therefore, those who were criticized automatically posted big-character posters expressing their determination to correct themselves, and felt comfortable. In addition, "Red and Expert Schools" were opened in the cafeteria to explain various policy issues in detail. Finally, a gala was held, and the team's cultural troupe participated in the performance. Everyone's emotions were high, reaching an unprecedented level.

Hold High the Red Flag and Continue to Leap Forward
In order to guide the high enthusiasm of the masses to the current production in a timely manner, the brigade leaders also led the masses to discuss the relationship between production and distribution. In the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that happiness comes from labor. Only by doing a good job in production and having abundant products can we guarantee the consolidation and development of the supply system and rapidly improve the living standards. On the basis of improving understanding, the brigade leaders also carried out organizational work, established production professional groups, carried out competitions and evaluations, and rewarded advanced elements. At the same time, they also stipulated the upper and lower work system and determined the progress and quality requirements of agricultural work. In addition, they also seized the handling of various economic policy issues and actively improved work and cared about relevant welfare undertakings, and the masses further fueled their enthusiasm for production.

After a series of education, especially after clarifying the relationship between production and distribution, the communist style was greatly promoted. In terms of labor attitude, the members are always concerned about how to do a good job in production. Taking Ding Fanmao as an example, in order to improve the quality of deep plowing, he modified the iron plow overnight and increased the plowing depth from eight or nine inches to more than one foot and two inches. Many members fertilized at night in the rain. Production team leaders Li Rongbao, Chen Zhangping and others made rationalization proposals to change the original "east-west ridges" in the autumn plowing fields to "north-south ridges" to increase sunlight. Now, everyone gets up and goes to the fields at four o'clock in the morning every day, and the people who deliver fertilizer carry their burdens as if flying. People's moral character has improved, and the relationship between people has become closer, and many moving stories have appeared. For example, when Yang Mingjiang was sent to work outside, he repeatedly told his wife before leaving: "You must run in front when working, and you must not let others call you!" Chen Kaifu used to have a bad attitude towards labor, and his wife Wang Guilan criticized him and said: "You can't do that anymore, otherwise, how can you be worthy of Chairman Mao!" One day, he went out on business, and met Xie Baigen, a child who was grazing cattle on the road. Baigen said: "You are not working, and you are running around, I will report to the team leader!" In the past, Chen Kaifu must have been unhappy, but this time he gave a thumbs up to encourage Xiao Baigen and said: "What a great kid!" Some elderly people in the Guazigou production team who do light work proposed to send good dishes to those who are tilling the land, and those who are tilling the land were so moved that they put forward the slogan: "Improve speed and quality to thank the care of family members!" The relationship between individuals and collectives has become closer, everyone loves the collective, and gave up more than 600 houses and invested more than 20,000 kilograms of iron to support the construction of the commune. Xie Enlin, Chen Fengying and many other members told their children when eating: "Take as much as you can eat, and you must cherish everyone's food!" There are more examples of small collectives obeying large collectives. For example, when the pig farm heard that the Grand Canal construction site needed wood, the six houses were not built temporarily, and the wood was transported out overnight. The Guazigou and Chenjia production teams had been at odds for 30 years due to water conservancy and other issues. Now the cadres and the masses say that if there are any more opinions, the commune will suffer losses, and they immediately reconciled.

    看事实  讲道理  谈远景  鼓干劲
    ——江苏句容黄梅人民公社大同大队开展共产主义教育的初步经验
    人民公社建成后，怎样进行政治思想工作？江苏省句容县黄梅人民公社大同大队，在二百四十三户的瓜子沟生产队进行试点，取得了初步经验，并在全大队广泛推开。这个大队大破资本主义思想，大立共产主义思想，使广大干部群众提高觉悟，明确方向，坚定了走社会主义和共产主义道路的决心，生产和生活的各方面也出现了崭新的局面。
    领导务虚认清形势
    大搞共产主义教育的必要性，并不是所有干部一开始都认识到的。由于不久前宣传过人民公社的优越性，有些人就认为早已宣传过了，用不着再教育了。他们借口说生产忙，没时间搞思想工作。因此，有的生产队对个别积极性不高的人放弃了教育工作，采取挂牌指名、不准吃饭的办法，结果反而起了消极作用。大队党总支分析了当时的形势，强调指出政治思想工作是一切工作的灵魂，如果只务实不务虚，好事也会变成坏结果。大家回忆几年来由互助组到初级社，由初级社到高级社，每一个转折点，党都进行了巨大的政治思想工作，然后才取得了全胜。因此，大家认识到：实行粮食供给制，和不断提高人们的共产主义觉悟和道德品质，这两件事是互相促进的。这时，“早已教育过”的论调消除了，确立了“不断教育”论；“教育和生产时间矛盾”的论调消除了，确立了“以虚带实”论。
    解决了干部思想问题后，一个轰轰烈烈的共产主义教育运动马上开展了。他们利用晚上和雨天的空隙时间进行活动，举行了谈心会和辩论会，运用了大字报、黑板报、快板、漫画、标语、戏剧……十八般武器都使用起来了。
      首先辩通干部思想
    这次共产主义教育的主要特点，是密切结合中心工作，结合办社和生产分配中存在的问题，就实论虚。党总支首先摸清了分配问题上的思想情况，发现有“吃饭不要钱出懒汉”、“萝卜烧肉”、“养活别人”等几种错误论调，需要辩论清楚。经过分析，干部中首先存在不少问题，因此，决定先辩通干部的思想。
    瓜子沟生产队长、富裕中农陈章平等说：“干不干都有饭吃，人就不愿意干活了。”大队总支召集全大队干部就这个问题进行专题鸣放辩论。会上，张家上生产队长、贫农胡文华，首先批评陈章平这种说法是不相信群众的表现，也不符合事实。他说：实行粮食供给制以后，广大贫农下中农都欢欣鼓舞，过去积极的现在更积极，过去干劲不足的现在也鼓足了干劲。瓜子沟生产队小组长谢恩喜并举了例子：杨明江过去因超支出外搞副业，不出勤，一听说吃饭不要钱，就安心在家生产了。陈开富因过去劳力弱，人口多，常超支，心想：“反正干也超支，不干也超支，不干了！”现在，他说再不干就没良心，也积极起来。瓜子沟生产队五十二户贫农，就有五十户积极带头生产，二十四户中农，有十八户积极劳动。接着，大家又指出：个别不肯劳动的，平时就有，那是因为存在不劳而获的剥削思想，并不是因为实行粮食供给制而产生的。对劳动态度不好的人可以进行教育，使他转变。
    张家上生产队小组长王位民提出：“大家有得吃，就不听话了，难领导。”总支书记王有根辩驳说，实行粮食供给制，大家放下了吃饭的包袱，心情舒畅，觉悟更高，不是难领导，而是更好领导了。他举例说：“大家听说公社需要房子作食堂、仓库和幼儿园，自动地让出房子支持公社，这不是铁的事实吗？”经过讨论，大家提高了觉悟，统一了认识，原来认识模糊的人，都主动批判了自己的错误观点，表示决心搞好工作。
    “萝卜烧肉”的论调，是本位主义的论调，说本单位条件好，别的单位条件差，合并到一个公社里，别人揩了他的油。对这种人着重指出两点：一、不要只看到自己的条件好，别人的条件差，条件虽有不同，但是各有千秋，应该取长补短。二、应该发扬共产主义风格，反对斤斤计较。同时，进一步驳倒了本位主义者“不是为了个人，也是为了大家”的借口，指出本位主义实质上就是个人主义。
    至于认为自己劳力强、人口少，实行吃饭不要钱是“养活别人”的一些“吃亏论”者，多是富裕中农，给人的影响很坏，不但迷糊了一般中农的认识，当真以为被别人占了便宜；而且影响少数贫农的情绪，挺不起腰来。大队领导上决定就这个问题展开重点辩论。
  把武器交给贫农和下中农
    要驳倒这个错误论调，依靠什么人呢？大同大队领导上明确要依靠贫农和下中农，特别是他们中间的积极分子。这一大部分人对人民公社充满着幸福的向往，特别是实行了粮食供给制以后，衷心地感谢党和毛主席。但是，他们对为什么实行粮食供给制，还没有从分配原则上、从革命理论上认识清楚。因此，有些人在听到实行粮食供给制的消息时，一面兴奋、惊喜，一面又感到不大落实。在听见富裕中农说什么“我们养活他们啦”等等时，又好像有愧于心似的，不能很明确地表示态度。因此，大队先召集他们举行小型的谈心会，参加的多是劳力较弱、子女较多的长期超支户，让他们谈谈对实行粮食供给制的体会。谢恩林和他妻子劳力都比较弱，有四个孩子，过去生活困难。他说，过去全部按劳取酬，分红时，有些人高兴得大吃大喝，而他就在家里发愁。“好汉单怕连身五”，他家里还不止五口人。分的粮食不够吃，可是因为三番五次受到政府救济，不好意思再跟干部谈。有一次向富裕中农借一升米，还挨脸色。他说：“现在可好了！吃头一顿饭时，我端着碗心里就想：毛主席啊，您老人家这一下可给我拔掉穷根了！”说着说着，眼泪就簌簌地淌了下来。他是笑着流泪的。陈开富说：“过去兄弟分家，老大有的吃，老二照样挨饿；现在公社比兄弟骨肉还亲，共同富裕！”大家谈出了很多心里话，衷心拥护现在的分配制度，并且认识到吃饭不要钱是共产主义因素，谈不上谁养活谁，只要全心全意为公社劳动，公社就负责供给口粮。
      驳倒“吃亏”论
    接着，便举行辩论会，驳斥“吃亏”论。富裕中农杨明达等说今年收入不如去年分红多，自己“养活了别人”，“吃亏”了。许多贫农和下中农等都积极批判这种错误论调。批判是虚实并举的。第一，谈远景规划，如现在吃饭不要钱，还只是第一步，将来还要实行穿衣不要钱，住房不要钱，剃头、洗澡、看戏不要钱，等等。社里规划建筑居民点，装电灯，铺马路，设立医院、电影院……。和那时比起来，现在生活算得了什么。每个人都应该放远眼光，不能只计较个人利益。第二，谈共同富裕的道理，指出如果按照过去的分配办法，愁的愁，笑的笑，就不能共同富裕。不能共同富裕，你一个人好一点，也不痛快。况且，劳力、人口等条件也会变化的，谁能保证没有三灾四病，劳力永远比别人强？各人都有老的时候，靠工分不如靠公社。第三，目前还有按劳取酬部分，发给工资，劳动多的和劳动好的，级别就高些，生活也可以好一些。
    由于辩论和算账入情入理，都是事实，并且帮助提高了认识，因此大家都很心服。特别是杨明达，起初坐在角落里把一顶旧礼帽拉下来盖着半个脸，情绪不高；到散会时就掀起帽子，满脸笑容，高兴地说：“理不说不明，这一次会啊可把我提高了，我一定积极地干！”第二天一早就出勤干起来了。
    根据群众在自我教育中朴素的认识，领导上联系理论详细讲解了分配政策。由于大家在辩论中有了实际感受，所以提高到理论上一宣传，人人能够接受。因此，公布分配方案时，家家拥护，个个赞成。提倡共产主义的劳动态度
    群众基本发动起来了，但是大队领导上并没有满足于这一点；感到有些事情要继续做：一、表扬模范人物，树立旗帜。二、发动大家对队里工作、对干部提意见，并提改进生产的建议。主要的鸣放办法是贴大字报。
    群众的眼睛最亮，表扬了许多积极分子，并揭发了一些问题。一张大字报画着一个老农病在床上，心里还想着田里生产，病未全好，就下田干活了。旁边写着：“谢信和，年龄高，生病在家头发烧，别人劝他静休养，他说生产丢不了。病情刚刚有好转，马上穿衣向外跑，卷起袖子拿工具，积极去把生产搞。”另一张大字报画着一个人过去在太阳下干活，现在在月亮下干活，旁边写着：“吉荣富，好得很，办了公社更认真，从前生产十分劲，现在干劲十二分！”批评的大字报，有事实，有说理，既尖锐，又热情。有一张这样写着：“中农张芳荣，思想不开通。干活装害病，吃饭打冲锋。你问为啥事，因为不记工。大家评评他思想，资本主义很严重。诚意来劝张芳荣，这条道路走不通。快快跟上大集体，积极劳动放心中。社会主义建设好，共享幸福你有功。”通过群众性的表扬批评，既发扬先进，巩固成绩，又帮助落后，迎头赶上。大家明辨了是非，分清了香臭，感到进步光荣，落后可耻，形成了人人向上，个个跃进的社会风气。领导上在动员时，讲了辩证法，指出事物是发展的，不能把人看死，今天不积极的，明天改正缺点，加劲干，并且巩固下去，就积极了。这样便鼓励大家解除顾虑，勇于接受批评，并用行动来表明决心。因此，被批评的人，都自动出了大字报，表示改正的决心，而且做到心情舒畅。此外，食堂里还开办“红专学校”，细致讲解各项政策问题。最后举行了一个晚会，并由队里文工团参加演出，大家情绪高涨，达到了前所未有的程度。
      高举红旗继续跃进
    大队领导上为了把群众的高度热情及时引导到当前生产上来，还领导群众讨论了生产与分配的关系。讨论中，大家一致认为：幸福是从劳动中得来，只有搞好生产，有了丰富的产品，才能保证供给制的巩固和发展，迅速提高生活水平。在提高认识的基础上，大队领导上又进行了组织工作，成立生产专业组，开展竞赛评比，奖励先进。同时并规定上下工制度，确定农活进度和质量的要求。此外，又抓紧处理各项经济政策问题，并积极改进工作和关心有关福利事业，群众更进一步鼓足了生产热情。
    经过一系列的教育，特别是明确了生产与分配的关系以后，大大发扬了共产主义风格。在劳动态度上，社员们时时刻刻都记挂着如何搞好生产。以丁凡茂来说，为了提高深耕质量，连夜改装铁犁，把耕地深度由八、九寸提高到一尺二寸以上。很多社员深夜冒雨积肥。生产队长李荣宝、陈章平等并提合理化建议，把秋耕田中原来的“东西埨”改为“南北埨”，以增加日照。现在，大家每天四点多钟就起来下田，送肥的人挑担如飞。人们的道德品质提高了，人与人的关系更加亲密了，出现了很多动人的事例。像杨明江被派往外面做工时，临行前再三嘱咐妻子说：“干活要跑在前面，千万不能让人家来喊哪！”陈开富过去劳动态度不够好，他妻子王桂兰就批评他说：“你不能再那样了，要不，你怎能对得起毛主席！”一天，他因公外出，路上遇着正在放牛的儿童谢白根，白根说：“你不干活，又瞎跑了，我要报告队长了！”要是过去，陈开富一定不高兴，这一次他竖起大拇指鼓励小白根说：“真是呱呱叫的好孩子！”瓜子沟生产队有些做轻活的老年人，提议把好菜送给耕田的人吃，耕田的人感动得提出口号：“提高速度和质量，答谢家里人的关心！”个人与集体的关系更亲密了，大家酷爱集体，让出六百多间房子，投出两万多斤铁，支持公社建设。谢恩林和陈凤英等很多社员在吃饭时告诉孩子说：“吃多少盛多少，大家的粮食要爱惜！”小集体服从大集体的事例，更说不完，如养猪场听说大运河工地需要木料，六间房子暂时不盖了，连晚把木料运出。瓜子沟和陈家两个生产队为水利等问题，三十年来一直不和睦，现在干群们说，再有意见，就会使公社受损失，马上和好了。	（江苏省委农村工作部工作组　赵力田执笔）
