    A Very Bad Deal
    Argentine "Times" Opposes Government Accepting US Investment

    This newspaper reports that the Argentine "Times" published an article on October 26th entitled "Our Oil, American Groups and the Oil Fields Administration," accusing the Argentine government's signing of oil contracts with American companies headed by Atlas Corporation as an act damaging to Argentina's national interests.

    The article revealed that American investment was much more expensive than the investment of the Argentine Oil Fields Administration in terms of price. The article stated that the Argentine Oil Fields Administration pays 1.5 million pesos (Argentine currency) for an oil well with a depth of 1,800 meters. However, according to the contract signed between the Argentine government and the American companies, each oil well requires a total of 120,000 US dollars, which, according to the US-Argentine currency exchange rate, translates to 7.2 million pesos per well. This is 5.7 million pesos more expensive than the cost of drilling a well by the Argentine Oil Fields Administration. The article also pointed out that according to the contract, American companies are to drill 4,000 wells, so the total difference will amount to a huge 22.8 billion pesos. Therefore, the article said, "American capital is a very bad deal for us (referring to Argentina)."

    The article advocates that all of Argentina's energy resources should be developed by the state through the Oil Fields Administration.

    一桩极坏的交易
    阿根廷“时报”反对政府接受美国投资
    本报讯　阿根廷“时报”10月26日刊载了一篇题为“我们的石油、美国集团和石油矿藏管理局”的文章，指责阿根廷政府同以阿特拉斯公司为首的美国公司签订的石油合同，是损害阿根廷民族利益的行为。
    文章揭露了美国的投资要比阿根廷石油矿藏管理局的投资在价格方面高得多。文章说，阿根廷石油矿藏管理局支付一口深度为一千八百公尺的油井，价值是一百五十万比索（阿币），但是，根据阿根廷政府同美国公司签订的合同，每一口油井总共需要十二万美元，按照阿美货币兑换率折成比索，每口井需要七百二十万比索，这就比阿根廷石油矿藏管理局钻一口油井的成本贵五百七十万比索。文章还指出，根据合同美国公司要钻四千口井，这样总差额将达二百二十八亿比索之巨。因而，这篇文章说，“美国资本对我们（指阿根廷）是一桩极坏的交易”。
    文章主张通过石油矿藏管理局由国家来开发阿根廷的一切动力资源。
