Shanghai, November 17 (By our own correspondent) A magnificent mass movement is unfolding further in Shanghai's major iron and steel enterprises. The mass movement is sweeping away the weak links in production, and with the support of all parts of the country, the city's steel production has increased dramatically, and the quality has generally improved. In the first half of November, the city produced more than 110,000 tons of steel, with an average daily output of 7,350 tons, nearly double the average daily output in October and more than three times that of September.

The characteristics of the production leap forward in the past half month are that the production of newly built steelmaking workshops is tending to normalize, and the output is gradually increasing; the old workshops are further tapping their potential and continue to surge forward. The two new converter workshops of Shanghai Steel No. 1 Plant and Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant, each with an annual output of 600,000 tons, began to reverse the unstable production situation after launching a mass movement in the first half of October. The daily output has increased sharply from 300-400 tons to about 800 tons, and the output on three days exceeded the 1,000-ton mark. The two national high-yield red flag workshops—the open hearth workshop of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant and the old converter workshop of Shanghai Steel No. 1 Plant—have continuously set new records for rapid steelmaking since November. The hourly steel output of the open hearth workshop of No. 3 Plant increased by 1.2 tons compared with October, and it has set 21 new records for rapid steelmaking in half a month. Sun Wanyin, a veteran steelmaker, personally smelted a furnace of 45 tons of steel in three hours and twenty-two minutes on the 15th, creating the highest new record for small open hearth steelmaking in the country. The output of the old converter workshop of No. 1 Plant has been above 1,000 tons for ten days in the first half of this month, which is unprecedented in history.

Now, the steelmaking workshops of large steel plants such as Shanghai Steel No. 1 Plant and No. 3 Plant are full of a fighting atmosphere. Big-character posters and big victory reports are all over the walls. The weaker the original production workshop, the more big-character posters are posted, and the more significant the power of the mass movement is. Workers in the two new workshops of Shanghai Steel No. 1 Plant and No. 3 Plant posted thousands of big-character posters in two or three days. Before the masses were mobilized in the first half of October, the cadres in these two workshops were in a flurry, the workers were at a loss, the equipment failed frequently, the production was very abnormal, and the daily output remained at the level of 200-300 tons for a long time. In the second half of October, the cadres criticized the wrong view that "new workshops have many new workers, so we can only rely on administrative orders to do things," went deep into the masses, seized the weak links in production and management such as furnace lining and iron smelting furnaces, and launched the masses to speak out freely, which quickly normalized production. In the furnace lining section of the new workshop of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant, the quality of bricklaying and furnace building was very poor. Some furnaces collapsed without steelmaking after they were built. Now, the efficiency of bricklaying and furnace building is not only fast, but also of good quality. On average, a furnace could only smelt more than 20 furnaces of steel in the past, but now it can smelt 42 furnaces, and the high one can reach 82 furnaces. There are often several spare furnaces in the workshop, eliminating the phenomenon of stopping blowing because there are no furnaces. In the middle of speaking out freely, the consciousness of the new workers has been greatly improved, and the spirit of communist cooperation has been greatly strengthened. Everyone is working hard to study and familiarize themselves with the technology.

The open hearth workshop of Shanghai Steel No. 1 Plant had failed to complete the state plan for three consecutive months before October. The cadres were worried and the workshop was deserted. After mobilizing the masses in October, they broke the conservative thinking and boldly expanded the furnace capacity. The workers went to the open hearth workshop of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant, the national high-yield red flag, several times to learn, and launched a competition with No. 3 Plant, setting off a mass movement of "learning from No. 3 Plant, catching up with No. 3 Plant, and surpassing No. 3 Plant." Leading cadres and workers together implemented three shifts of grasping, furnace by furnace grasping, and everyone caring about production. The original two small open hearth furnaces with a design capacity of 30 tons each in this workshop are now improved to load 60-70 tons each, and the high one reaches 76 tons. Without increasing manpower and equipment, the output in October increased by nearly one time, and the utilization coefficient jumped from 8.46 tons to 15.74 tons. In the first half of November, the average daily output increased by another 55 tons compared with October, and the utilization coefficient reached a new high of 17.54 tons.

In the mass movement, various factories overcame many difficulties caused by the small amount and poor quality of pig iron and coke. Since October, because most steelmaking workshops use indigenous iron and indigenous coke to make steel, iron smelting furnaces are often frozen and converter tuyeres are blocked, and steel ingots cannot be demoulded. The workers have created many ways to solve these difficulties. The workers of Shanghai Steel No. 6 Plant have taken measures such as carefully selecting coking coal, adding materials evenly, and keeping the tuyeres unblocked, and have basically eliminated the phenomenon of iron smelting furnace freezing. Employees of the Central Laboratory of the Metallurgical Bureau created a demoulding device, which greatly improved the efficiency of demoulding work.

Cadres in the science and technology departments and service personnel in many factories have taken the initiative to participate in rush jobs such as sorting, transporting, and charging raw materials. Under the condition that the quality of raw materials is not good, the workers of various steel plants not only ensure the output of steel, but also pay attention to improving the quality. They take measures such as more testing and frequent testing to master the composition of raw materials and molten steel. Some factory workers take samples of pig iron at the docks for testing, and the laboratory and workshop also work closely to quickly test the quality of molten steel. Furnace workers also generally take measures to remove sulfur and phosphorus impurities from molten steel. The youth steelmaking team in the old converter workshop of Shanghai Steel No. 6 Plant has produced steel with a qualified rate of over 92% to 99% from August to now. The quality of steel ingots produced by the two large new converter workshops of Shanghai Steel No. 1 Plant and No. 3 Plant has also been significantly improved. Since November, most of the steel ingots can be rolled into steel.

    上海工人炼出更多好钢
    群众运动无往不胜，日产量比十月份跃增近倍
    本报上海17日电　上海各大型钢铁企业中一个波澜壮阔的群众运动正在进一步展开。群众运动横扫生产中的薄弱环节，加上全国各地的支援，全市钢产量突飞猛进，质量普遍提高。11月上半月，全市共产钢十一万多吨，平均日产七千三百五十吨，超过10月份平均日产量将近一倍，等于9月份的三倍多。
    这半个月来生产跃进的特点，是新建炼钢车间的生产情况趋向正常，产量逐步上升；老车间进一步挖掘潜力继续猛进。上钢一厂和上钢三厂两个年产量各六十万吨的新转炉车间，自10月上半月大搞群众运动以后，开始扭转了生产不稳定局面，日产量从三、四百吨猛增到八百吨上下，并有三天的产量突破一千吨大关。两个全国高产红旗车间——上钢三厂平炉车间和上钢一厂老转炉车间，11月以来连创快速炼钢新纪录。三厂平炉车间每小时产钢量比10月份增加一点二吨，半个月内连创二十一个快速炼钢新纪录。炼钢老将孙万银15日亲手以三小时二十二分钟炼出了一炉四十五吨钢，创造了全国小型平炉炼钢的最高新纪录。一厂老转炉车间这月上半月内有十天的产量在一千吨以上，这是历史上从来没有过的。
    现在，上钢一厂、三厂等大型钢厂的炼钢车间里，充满一片战斗气氛。大字报和大喜报满墙满壁。越是原来生产薄弱的车间，大字报贴得越多，群众运动的威力也越显著。上钢一厂和三厂两个新车间的工人两三天内贴出了几千张大字报，这两个车间在10月上半月群众没有发动以前，干部忙乱不堪，工人无所适从，设备故障频繁，生产极不正常，日产量长时间停留在二、三百吨的水平。10月下半月，干部中批判了“新车间新工人多，只能靠行政命令办事”的错误观点，深入群众，抓住炉衬、化铁炉等生产和管理中的薄弱环节，发动群众大鸣大放，使生产迅速正常起来。上钢三厂新车间的炉衬工段，原来打砖、砌炉的质量很坏，有的炉子砌好以后，没有炼钢就烘垮；现在打砖、砌炉的效率不仅快，而且质量好，平均一只炉子过去只能炼二十多炉钢，现在已可以炼到四十二炉，高的达到八十二炉。车间里经常有几只后备炉子，消灭了因为没有炉子而停止吹炼的现象。在大鸣大放中间，新工人的觉悟大大提高，共产主义协作精神也大为加强，大家都努力钻研和熟悉技术。
    上钢一厂平炉车间，10月份以前曾经连续三个月没有完成国家计划，干部愁眉不展，车间里冷冷清清；10月份发动群众以后，大破保守思想，大胆扩大炉膛容积，工人们几次到全国平炉高产红旗的上钢三厂平炉车间学习，并和三厂展开竞赛，掀起了热火朝天的“学三厂、赶三厂、超三厂”的群众运动。领导干部和工人一起，实行三班抓、炉炉抓，人人关心生产。这个车间原来两座设计能力三十吨的小平炉，现在改进后每座装到六、七十吨，高的到七十六吨。在不增加人力和设备的情况下，10月份产量增长近一倍，利用系数由八点四六吨跳到十五点七四吨，11月上半月平均日产量比10月份又提高五十五吨，利用系数达到十七点五四吨的新高峰。
    各厂在大搞群众运动中，克服了生铁和焦炭来量少、质量差所造成的许多困难。10月份以来，因为大部分炼钢车间用土铁、土焦炼钢，因而化铁炉常被冻结，转炉风眼堵塞，钢锭模脱不出来，工人们就创造了很多办法来解决这些困难。上钢六厂的工人采取精选焦煤、加料均匀、保持风眼畅通等办法，已基本上消除了化铁炉冻结现象。冶金局中心试验室职工创造了一种冲模器，大大提高脱模工作的效率。
    许多厂的科室干部、服务人员都主动参加原材料的整理、运输和加料等突击工作。各钢铁厂工人们在原料质量不好的情况下，不但保证钢的产量，而且注意提高质量。他们采取多化验、勤化验的办法，掌握原料和钢水成分。有的厂工人们到码头上取样化验生铁，化验室和车间也紧密配合，快速化验钢水质量。炉前工人也普遍采取措施，脱去钢水中的硫、磷杂质。上钢六厂老转炉车间的青年炼钢班从8月到现在炼出的钢，合格率在92％到99％以上。上钢一厂和三厂两个大型新转炉车间生产的钢锭质量也有显著提高，11月份以来，大部分钢锭都可以轧成钢材。
