(Our reporter from Karamay, November 8th) The significant achievements and experiences gained by China's natural petroleum industry in conducting mass movements and technological revolutions have resolved several fundamental problems that have long remained unsolved in the development of China's natural petroleum industry. The Ministry of Petroleum Industry recently held an on-site conference in Karamay to summarize and promote these experiences. Through this conference, China's petroleum industry will usher in a new upsurge.

The conference believes that the petroleum industry's implementation of the Party's General Line, with drilling as the center, has yielded great results. First, in this year's mass movement, workers creatively mastered the technology of high-speed drilling. More than 80% of these technological creations came directly from the hands of production workers. This year, the national drilling speed is three times that of last year, and the total drilling footage for the year is equal to the total for the past five years, while the investment is only one-third of that of the past five years. Now, one drilling rig and one crew are equivalent to three drilling rigs and three crews in the past. Because wells are drilled quickly, oilfield exploration has achieved a large-scale harvest this year. Second, a "Chinese-style" path for developing oilfields has been found, creating a set of equipment and methods for developing oilfields that are in line with the Party's General Line of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Third, a path for comprehensive utilization, diversified management, and self-reliance in developing the natural petroleum industry has been found within the petroleum industry system.

The conference believes that the basic experiences of the mass movement on the petroleum industry front this year are, first, the unified leadership of the Party, and second, the concept of "large-scale." This "large-scale" means holding large-scale meetings, conducting large-scale competitions, large-scale evaluations, and large-scale inspections. In other words, carrying out large-scale mass movements and large-scale technological revolutions. The so-called large-scale meetings involve organizing large-scale, high-momentum mobilization meetings, oath-taking rallies, dedication rallies, and skills competitions to continuously mobilize the masses and inspire their fighting will. The benefit of holding large-scale meetings is that with more people, there is greater momentum and high morale. There are more ideas, which is conducive to stimulating the revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm of the masses. It can quickly transform the Party's guidelines and tasks into the actions of the masses and fully unleash their initiative and creativity, creating a lively situation. The so-called large-scale competition involves carrying out comprehensive large-scale competitions with high targets and high speeds between units, enterprises, and regions. This year, the petroleum industry front launched a "set the standard, seize the standard" large-scale competition movement nationwide, drawing workers from all walks of life on the petroleum front into this torrent of large-scale competition. The battle for the standard-bearer among advanced drilling teams in various exploration areas such as Yumen and Xinjiang has become a huge force driving the overall leap forward in drilling work and other tasks. The so-called large-scale inspection is to continuously organize mass cross-inspections and evaluation activities to promote the continuous leap forward of individuals and units, ensuring the persistence and continuity of the mass movement.

The conference criticized the bourgeois ideology of not wanting the Party's leadership, not wanting the mass line, and regarding themselves as "masters of the oilfields" in the field of science and technology on the petroleum industry front. The conference pointed out that scientific and technological work must be placed under the absolute leadership of the Party, and scientific and technological workers must accept ideological transformation and take the path of being both red and expert.

In order to push the mass movement on the petroleum industry front to a new climax and promote the rapid development of the petroleum industry, the conference believes that the following issues should be resolved in the future. (1) Strengthen the absolute leadership of the Party on the petroleum front, and all production and technical work must be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party committee. Carry out a struggle against bourgeois ideology in various petroleum enterprises to clear obstacles on the road to large-scale mass movements. (2) Universally study Chairman Mao's works and carry out communist education movements among workers and staff. (3) Universally establish red and expert universities, technical schools, and scientific research institutions in various factories and mining enterprises to rapidly cultivate a scientific and technological contingent of the working class that is both red and expert. (4) Carry out the "five-ization" movement in various factories and mining enterprises, and promote the experience of the Xinjiang Mining Bureau in militarizing organizational actions, unifying production work, integrating collaboration and cooperation, and integrating labor, education, and scientific research, and collectivizing life. (5) Further emancipate the mind, break down superstitions, engage in large-scale technological revolutions, and fully unleash the subjective initiative of people and the potential of mechanical equipment, and strive to over fulfill this year's and next year's production tasks.

    钻透千层土　涌出万吨油
    石油现场会议推广快速钻井经验
    本报克拉玛依8日电　我国天然石油工业大搞群众运动和大闹技术革命所获得的重大成就和经验，已经解决了我国天然石油工业发展道路上长期没有解决的几个带有根本性的问题。最近石油工业部在克拉玛依的现场会议上总结和推广这方面的经验，通过这次会议，我国石油工业将出现更新的高潮。
    会议认为石油工业以钻井为中心贯彻党的总路线，收获是很大的。首先是在今年大搞群众运动中，职工创造性的掌握了高速度钻井的技术。这种技术创造，有80％以上的创造直接出于生产工人之手。今年全国钻井速度等于去年的三倍，全年钻井进尺等于过去五年的总和，投资只等于过去五年的三分之一。现在一部钻机和一套人马已等于过去三部钻机和三套人马。由于井打的快，今年油田勘探获得了大面积的丰收。第二、找到了开发油田的“中国式”的道路，创造了一套符合党的总路线的多快好省开发油田的设备和方法。第三、在石油工业系统找到了综合利用，多种经营、自力更生发展天然石油工业的途径。
    会议认为今年石油工业战线上大搞群众运动的基本经验，一是党的统一领导，二是“大”。这个“大”就是开大会、搞大竞赛、大评比、大检查。也就是大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命。所谓开大会，就是通过组织大规模、大声势的动员大会、誓师大会、献礼大会、比武大会，不断发动群众和鼓舞群众的战斗意志。开大会的好处是人多势大，斗志昂扬、办法多、利于激发群众革命干劲和热情，能把党的方针、任务迅速变成群众的行动，能够充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，形成生动活泼的局面。所谓搞大竞赛，就是开展单位之间、企业之间、地区之间高指标、高速度的全面大竞赛。石油工业战线上今年在全国范围内展开“立标杆、夺标杆”的大竞赛运动，把石油战线上各行各业的职工都卷进这个大竞赛的洪流。玉门、新疆等各个探区之间的先进井队的争夺标杆战，成为带动钻井工作和各项工作全面跃进的巨大力量。所谓大检查就是不断组织群众性的交叉检查和评比活动，促进个人和单位不断跃进。保证了群众运动的持久性和连续性。
    会议对石油工业战线上科学技术领域中不要党的领导、不要群众路线，以 “油田主人”自居的资产阶级思想进行了批判。会议指出：科学技术工作必须置于党的绝对领导下，科学技术工作者必须接受思想改造，走又红又专的道路。
    为了把石油工业战线上的群众运动推向一个新的高潮，促进石油工业飞跃发展，会议认为今后应该解决下列几个问题。（一）加强党在石油战线上的绝对领导，各项生产工作和技术工作必须在党委统一领导下进行。在各个石油企业开展反对资产阶级思想的斗争，扫清大搞群众运动道路上的障碍。（二）在职工群众中普遍学习毛主席著作和开展共产主义教育运动。（三）在各个厂矿企业普遍举办红专大学、技术学校和科学研究机构，迅速培养一支既红又专的工人阶级的科学技术队伍。（四）在各个厂矿企业开展“五化”运动，推广新疆矿务局组织行动军事化、生产工作一元化、协作配合整体化，劳动、教育、科学研究一体化，生活集体化的经验。（五）进一步解放思想，破除迷信，大闹技术革命，充分发挥人的主观能动性和机械设备的潜力，为超额完成今年和明年的生产任务而奋斗。
