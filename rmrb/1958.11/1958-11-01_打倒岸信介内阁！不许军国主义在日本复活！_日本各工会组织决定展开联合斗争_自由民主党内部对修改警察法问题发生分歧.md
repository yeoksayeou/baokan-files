Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Tokyo: Kenji Ota, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), stated at a press conference in Onahama, Iwaki City, Fukushima Prefecture, on the evening of the 30th that Sohyo would develop democratic actions by workers to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. He said that even if we crushed the "Amendment to the Police Duties Execution Law," the Kishi Nobusuke government would continue to formulate the "Anti-Espionage Law," revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and adopt other war policies.

Ota pointed out that the war policies and policies to suppress workers pursued by the Kishi Nobusuke government were supported by the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations and other Japanese monopoly financial capital groups. He said that in order to attack these monopoly financial capital groups, Japanese workers would vigorously launch a climax of economic struggles demanding the issuance of temporary allowances from the end of this year to the spring of next year, and would carry out strength struggles for a long time.

Ota announced to reporters Sohyo's struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," as well as the plans for the struggles at the end of this year and the spring of next year.

Ota said that Sohyo supports the Socialist Party's attitude of refusing to extend the term of the extraordinary session of the Diet in order to crush the "Amendment to the Police Duties Execution Law." He said that when launching a strength struggle on November 5th, Sohyo would mobilize with the full strength of the entire organization to the greatest extent, and would also mobilize 60,000 to 100,000 people to the Diet building on November 6th and 7th to oppose the passage of this "Amendment."

Ota said that it is also necessary to further expand the climax of national public opinion, and finally to form a national front against Kishi Nobusuke. He said that the people participating in the national front should demand the dissolution of the Diet, and that organizations such as national conferences against the evil revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" should be established in various prefectures and regions to launch a signature campaign against Kishi Nobusuke or demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

Ota went to Onahama, Iwaki City, Fukushima Prefecture to participate in the temporary conference of the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation, of which he is the chairman.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from Tokyo: The All-Japan Trade Union Congress (Zenro会议) today unanimously passed the struggle policy proposed by Secretary-General Haruo Wada at its fifth national convention held in Tokyo, opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's evil revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

This struggle policy stipulates that the 770,000 members of the various unions affiliated with the All-Japan Trade Union Congress should simultaneously hold a one-hour work stoppage at their respective workplaces on November 5th to protest the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

The All-Japan Seamen's Union, belonging to the All-Japan Trade Union Congress, has already ordered its members today to stop work for one hour from 13:00 on November 5th as part of the joint struggle. During this one-hour work stoppage, all loading, unloading, and work on ships in port will be suspended, except for dangerous or urgent work. The Japan Coal Miners' Union officially decided today to hold a 24-hour strike in all mines across the country on November 5th, and has issued instructions to all branches of the union. At the same time, the National Telecommunications Workers' Union has also decided to hold workplace rallies for two to three hours in various locations on November 5th.

The Western Regional Council of the National Railway Workers' Union decided at a representative conference held in Fukuoka City on the 29th that workplace rallies against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" will be held on November 5th in Moji, Oita, Kumamoto, Kagoshima, Hiroshima and other places. Deputy Chairman Fujii of this council pointed out that the struggle on November 5th will be the largest struggle since the spring of last year.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the National Federation of Industrial Organizations, and most neutral system unions had previously decided separately to hold a joint struggle on November 5th. This is the first joint struggle of the Japanese labor front since its split in 1954.

Other strata of the Japanese people also strongly oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law." The Japan Artists League today submitted a request to the government, the Diet, and various political parties, saying: "We hope that the Amendment to the Police Duties Execution Law will be carefully reviewed so as not to infringe on human rights and hinder artists from freely publishing their creations." The Japan Association for the Protection of Children expressed opposition to this amendment. It said: "From the standpoint of protecting children, we are concerned about the Amendment to the Police Duties Execution Law." The Religious Persons Roundtable Conference, the Doshisha University Faculty Group, and the Fukui University Teachers College Faculty Group have all issued statements of opposition.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's stubborn attitude of attempting to restore the police state by revising the "Police Duties Execution Law" at all costs has even aroused dissatisfaction among some people within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. According to reports, Liberal Democratic Party leaders of the anti-mainstream faction, such as Mitsujiro Ishii, held a meeting last night to discuss the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," and they expressed a "critical attitude" towards this issue.

The Liberal Democratic Party's General Affairs Council held a special meeting for this matter today. General Affairs Chairman Ichiro Kono said at the meeting that it has been decided that the deputy secretaries-general will separately "inquire about the truth" from those who attended last night's meeting. Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Masajiro Kawashima also made a statement today, admitting that Mitsujiro Ishii and others "more or less will have some opinions." Therefore, he will meet with them individually to "adjust" their opinions so that they will "agree."

    打倒岸信介内阁！不许军国主义在日本复活！
    日本各工会组织决定展开联合斗争
    自由民主党内部对修改警察法问题发生分歧
    新华社31日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会议长太田熏30日晚上在福岛县磐城市小名滨的记者招待会上说，“总评”将发展工人的民主行动来打倒岸信介内阁。他说，因为即使我们粉碎了“警察官职务执行法修正案”，岸信介政府仍然要继续制订“防谍法”，修改日美“安全条约”，并且采取其它战争政策。
    太田熏指出，岸信介政府所奉行的战争政策和镇压工人的政策，得到了日本经营者团体联盟等日本垄断金融资本集团的支持。他说，为了向这些垄断金融资本集团进攻，日本工人将在今年年底到明年春天大力展开要求发给临时津贴等经济斗争的高潮，并且要长期进行实力斗争。
    太田熏向记者们宣布了“总评”反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争，以及今年年底和明年春季斗争的计划。
    太田熏说，“总评”支持社会党为了粉碎“警察官职务执行法修正案”而拒绝延长国会临时会议会期的态度。他说，在11月5日举行实力斗争的时候，“总评”将以整个组织的力量进行最大限度的动员，并且还要在11月6日和7日动员六万到十万人到国会大厦去反对通过这个“修正案”。
    太田熏说，还要进一步扩大国民舆论的高潮，最后要结成反对岸信介的国民战线。他说，要由参加国民战线的人们来要求解散国会，并且要在各县和各地区成立反对恶劣修改“警察官职务执行法”国民会议等组织，来展开反对岸信介或要求解散国会的签名运动。
    太田熏是到福岛县磐城市小名滨来参加合成化学产业工会联合会临时大会的，他是这个联合会的委员长。
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：全日本工会会议今天在东京举行的第五次全国大会，一致通过了由书记长和田春生提出的反对岸信介政府恶劣修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争方针。
    这项斗争方针规定，全日本工会会议所属各工会的七十七万会员要在11月5日在各个工作场所同时举行脱离工作岗位一小时的斗争，以抗议岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”。
    属于全日本工会会议的全日本海员工会已经在今天命令它的会员们，从11月5日十三时起停止工作一小时，以作为联合斗争的一部分。在这一小时的停工中，除了有危险的或紧急的工作外，所有装货、卸货以及港内船只上的工作都将停止。日本煤矿工会今天正式决定，11月5日将在全国各矿山举行二十四小时的罢工，并且已经向这个工会的各支部发出了指示。同时，全国电气通信工会也决定在11月5日在各地举行两小时到三小时的工作场所大会。
    国营铁道工会西部地方协议会29日在福冈市举行的代表大会决定，11月5日将在门司、大分、熊本、鹿儿岛、广岛等地举行反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的工作场所大会。这个协议会的副议长藤井指出，11月5日的斗争将是去年春天以来的规模最大的斗争。
    日本工会总评议会、全国产业别工会联合会以及大多数中立系统的工会前此已经分别决定在11月5日举行联合斗争。这是日本劳工战线自从1954年分裂以后的第一次联合斗争。
    日本其他阶层人民也强烈地反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”。日本美术家联盟今天向政府、国会以及各政党提出要求说：“希望慎重地审议警察官职务执行法修正案，以免侵犯人权，妨碍艺术家自由地发表创作。”日本保卫儿童会表示反对这个修正案。它说：“我们从保卫儿童的立场出发，警察官职务执行法修正案使我们担忧。”宗教人恳谈会、同志社大学教授团、福井大学师范学院教授团都发表了反对的声明。
    岸信介政府不顾一切企图通过修改“警察官职务执行法”来恢复警察国家的顽固态度，甚至在执政的自由民主党内部也引起了一部分人的不满。据报道，自由民主党的石井光次郎等反主流派领导人昨天晚上开会讨论了岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的问题，他们对这个问题表示了“批判的态度”。
    自由民主党总务会今天专门为这件事举行了会议。总务会长河野一郎在会上说，已经决定由副干事长们分别向曾经出席昨天晚上的会议的人“探询真相”。自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎也在今天发表谈话，他承认石井光次郎等“多多少少会有些意见”。因此，他要个别地会见他们，“调整”他们的意见，以便使他们“同意”。
