　　Hometown of Poetry
　　By our reporters Yu Ming and Zhu Shulan
　　Singing Makes Huangshan Nod and Smile
　　Singing Keeps the Sun from Setting
　　The car was traveling on the highway from Hefei to Pukou. After passing through a tall Great Leap Forward gate, we seemed to be immersed in an ocean of poetry. Loud yangge and folk songs flew in from all directions, one after another. Everyone in the car was attracted by the singing. We looked out of the car and, ah! It turned out to be teams of commune members working in the fields. They sang while working, forming a large chorus in the entire field. The villages the car passed through had poems and paintings written on the walls of every house and on the earthen gates at the entrance of the villages. The roadsides were lined with poems made of white stones. There were also poems on some rooftops and distant hillsides. We knew that this was Siji Township in Chaoxian County, praised by people as the "Hometown of Poetry."

　　Not long after arriving in Siji Township, it got dark. The commune members carried their hoes home for dinner. Then, the singing gathered from the fields to every village. The quiet villages during the day were now enveloped in joyful songs. Soon after dinner, the commune members gathered together for evening parties. They didn't pay attention to any attire. Whether old or young, male or female, they went on the earthen stage and sang at the top of their lungs. Such a natural attitude and broad mind are rarely seen at ordinary concerts.

　　As soon as the evening party started, more than twenty girls sang "Song of Happiness" in the "Yatou Tune":
　　Girls like to sing folk songs, singing all over Chaohu and Chuhe,
　　Singing makes Huangshan nod and smile, singing keeps the sun from setting;
　　Girls like to sing folk songs, singing happiness songs as soon as they open their mouths,
　　Praising the Communist Party's good leadership, praising Chairman Mao's great kindness.

　　Was it only the young people who sang like this? No, look, the Old Huang Zhong Team of Wuyue Cooperative came on stage, the Old Grandma Team of Fangji came on stage, Su Changlai led his family of five in a chorus, Shu Shouchang sang with his grandson, and a group of children also came on stage to sing. The white-haired old grandma Wang Changrong sang:
　　Don't laugh at my teeth not closing, singing must sing "The East is Red."
　　The sixty-four-year-old Shu Shouchang sang:
　　If you ask me to sing, I will sing, I have a few baskets of folk songs in my belly,
　　If I don't sing in this world, what am I saving my energy for?

　　Such singing gatherings were held three times in a few days, with fifty or sixty different programs, and more than seven hundred people participated in the singing! But what we heard was still too little. Out of the 21,000 people in the township, 15,000 participated in the singing movement, and more than 13,000 were able to create poems and compose and sing their own songs. The township alone had twenty-five old grandma choirs. Liang Yingzhi, a middle-aged woman, could sing more than eighty tunes impromptu. Young female singers Hu Jiying, Jiang Daoying, and Wu Huazhi could sing more than a hundred songs. Participating in these evening parties and hearing songs all over the fields makes one think about how magnificent our era is and how happy our lives are!
　　Poems Cover Walls, Songs Connect the Fields
　　Labor Poems Can Never Be Finished

　　Every village in Siji Township has walls covered with poems and paintings. The township runs nine literary publications, which can only publish a portion of the works created by cadres and the masses. The largest literary garden is these earthen walls. From May to now, the township has created 250,000 poems and drawn more than 200,000 paintings, most of which are displayed on the walls to meet the masses. In Youfangji, there is a small street where, after walking fifty-two steps, there are about thirty poems and paintings on each side. Except for doors and windows, there is almost one poem and one painting for every step. These poems and paintings are not only numerous, but also treasures that are beautiful and captivating. In Youfangji, there is a poem about accumulating fertilizer: "Piles of fertilizer mud in every village, piling up a lazy dragon to reach the sky, when the commune members shout, the lazy dragon is scared and rolls into the field. The lazy dragon transforms into crops, piercing through the sky. After autumn, the granaries are full of grain, and the lazy dragon piles return to their original state."

　　A poem about fighting drought reads: "The Milky Way in the sky is ten thousand miles long, the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl are on opposite sides, using carts to carry the water of the Milky Way in the sky, men plowing and women weaving will forever be together." The poem is accompanied by a painting of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meeting, these poems and paintings poeticize the labor of people fighting the drought. A poem describing the enthusiasm of the masses reads: "The youth have great energy, ten thousand arrows are fired together, touching the sky and breaking it, hitting the ground and collapsing it, rivers must be tamed, mountains must be moved; all gods must step down, and I will be in charge." The momentum is magnificent, fully demonstrating the power of the masses.

　　Here, the promotion of technology is also done with wall poems and paintings, which are simple and clear. The masses said: "Technical drawings on the wall, like a treasure bag, all kinds of techniques, really a living classroom, looking at the paintings and reciting the poems, clear as the palm of your hand."

　　Here, we have the most profound impression: the poems of Siji Township will never be finished, and the songs of Siji Township will never be finished. The masses here create poems about whatever they do and sing songs about whatever they do. They call this creative method "watching the wind to gather willows" and "hanging signs according to the wind." They regard poetry as a tool for political mobilization. Poetry comes from labor, so the greater the political task and the more intense the labor, the more poems are created and the more enthusiastically the songs are sung.

　　This spring, Xu Shouqin, the secretary of the Siji Township Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses in the Great Leap Forward, first wrote a wall poem: "I learn what is good, I closely follow what is fast; people ride fast horses, I drive trains; others run and walk, I fly with wings." It was widely praised by the people. Later, it was created at the township cadres' meeting in conjunction with the promotion of the central work. Xu Shouqin created a poem that broke everyone's superstition: "Poems cover the walls, songs connect the fields, everyone studies and reads books, resolutely breaking through the cultural barrier, writers and poets are seen in the fields." With such a promotion, the creation in the township formed a climax in May. The township had more than one hundred days without rain in the summer, and the masses fought drought day and night, but the vast majority of the 200,000 poems were produced during this time. Aiming at encouraging people's enthusiasm for fighting the drought, cadres held meetings and went to the countryside to inspect work, and they all engaged in creation; the masses in the fields "pieced together" one sentence after another, and the 267 small teams in the township became 267 poetry creation groups. They competed and sang to each other, encouraging their fighting spirit. Fangji Cooperative organized a youth and elderly singing competition in May, creating more than 300 songs in one night. They created the battle song of "Cars cannot be used, so buckets are used, buckets cannot be carried, so ladles are used, even if ladles cannot scoop, dig underground, even a drop of water must moisten the seedlings," fighting hard against the drought, and every household stored water for washing faces and pots to use in the fields; the township dug more than 28,000 wells, an average of more than one well per household. They dug a dry ditch thirteen li long into a small river overnight, and they wrote: "The dry ditch becomes a river overnight, the Queen Mother of Heaven is very ashamed, opening the river is faster than I withdrawing the river, now I am willing to admit defeat." In early August, the township channeled the water of Chaohu Lake, hundreds of li away, to Huangshan by digging canals, and they sang again: "Huangshan has three hundred and sixty depressions, Chaohu has three hundred and sixty branches, one mountain and one water are hundreds of li away, now the two families are one family." They were in the day and night drought resistance for more than one hundred days, using poetry to encourage labor, and creating a large number of poems in labor. They finally overcame the drought and ensured a good harvest.

　　The enthusiasm of the masses in Siji Township for creation and singing is getting higher and higher. Zhang Chunzheng, the director of Shiqiao Cooperative, has created more than 900 poems in the past five months. He plans to create 1,500 to 2,000 this year. Other township and cooperative cadres and the masses also have amazing creation plans. The township will strive to create one million poems this year. The mystery of literature and art has been completely broken in front of them. Here, people will feel: "Thousands of writers, Li Bai and Du Fu are also ordinary." Here, people will feel that through poetry and other cultural activities, people's collectivist spirit is growing. Here, people will also feel that poetry is the product of the combination of physical labor and mental labor, and the seeds of communist literature and art have been produced. It will not only continue to prosper in Siji Township forever, but also will prosper forever in all urban and rural areas throughout the country. (Attached picture)

    诗歌之乡
    本报记者　于明　朱树兰
    唱得黄山点头笑
    唱得太阳不下坡
    汽车在合肥到浦口的公路上，驶过一座高大的跃进门，我们便像是浸沉在诗歌的海洋里了。嘹喨的秧歌、山歌声，从四面八方飞来，此起彼落，一车的人都被这歌声所吸引。我们向车外张望，啊！原来是一队队在田野里生产的社员，他们边劳动边唱歌，在整个田野里汇成了一支大合唱。汽车经过的村庄，每家的墙壁上、村口的土坊上，都写满诗歌和画幅，汽车路两旁用白石子垒的是诗句，在有些屋顶上、远远的山坡上，也都有诗句。我们知道，这是被人们赞誉为“诗歌之乡”的巢县司集乡到了。
    到达司集乡不一会，天就黑了。社员们扛着锄头回家吃晚饭，于是，歌声又从四野向每个村庄汇集。白天静静的村庄，这时为欢乐的歌声笼罩。晚饭后不久，社员们便聚在一起举行晚会。他们不讲究什么装束，不论是老的少的，男的女的，走上土台子就放开嗓子唱，那种自然的态度，开阔的胸怀，在一般音乐会上是很少看到的。
    晚会一开始，便有二十多个姑娘用“丫头调”唱起了“幸福歌”：
    姑娘喜欢唱山歌，唱遍巢湖和滁河，
    唱得黄山点头笑，唱得太阳不下坡；
    姑娘喜欢唱山歌，出口就唱幸福歌，
    歌颂共产党领导好，歌颂毛主席恩情多。
    难道只有青年们这样歌唱吗？不，你看，五岳社的老黄忠队上台了，坊集的老奶奶队上台了，苏长来领着一家五口在合唱，疏寿祥带着孙子在合唱，一群儿童也上台唱起来。白发苍苍的老奶奶汪长荣唱道：
    莫笑我牙齿不关风，唱歌要唱东方红。
    六十四岁的疏寿祥唱道：
    叫我唱歌就唱歌，肚里山歌几稻箩，
    如今世道我不唱，留着精神干什么？
    这样的歌唱会，在几天之内就举行了三次，不同的节目有五六十个，参加歌唱的人数有七百多个！但是，我们听到的还是太少了，全乡两万一千多人，参加歌唱运动的就有一万五千人，能够创作诗歌，自编自唱的达一万三千多人，全乡光是老奶奶合唱队就有二十五个。中年妇女梁英芝，能随口唱八十多个曲子，青年女歌手胡吉英、江道英、吴华芝能唱一百余支歌。参加这些晚会，听到遍野歌声，就会使人想到我们的时代是多么雄伟，我们的生活是多么幸福！
        诗满墙头歌连片
            劳动诗歌唱不完
    司集乡的每个村庄，都是诗画满墙。全乡办了九个文艺刊物，也只能刊登干部群众创作的一部分。最大的文艺园地要算这些土墙了。从5月到现在，全乡创作了二十五万首诗歌，画了二十多万幅画图，大半都靠写在墙上和群众见面。在油坊集，有一条小街，走五十二步，两边的诗画就各有三十篇左右，除了门窗，几乎是平均一步一诗一画。这些诗画不但数量多，而且简直是珠宝累累，美不胜收。在油坊集，有这样一首积肥诗：“村村肥泥堆连堆，堆个懒龙通上天，遇到社员一声吼，吓得懒龙滚下田。懒龙摇身猛一变，变做庄稼戳破天。秋后粮食堆满仓，懒龙堆子又还原”。
    一首抗旱诗写道：“天上银河万里长，牛郎织女各一方，车尽银河天上水，男耕女织永成双。”诗的旁边还配了牛郎织女相会的画，这些诗画把抗旱的人们的劳动诗化了。一首形容群众干劲的诗写道：“青年劲头大，万箭一齐发，触天天即破，碰地地即塌，江河要驯服，大山要搬家；诸神都退位，由我来当家。”气势磅礴，充分表现了群众的力量。
    在这里，对技术的宣传也用墙头诗和画，既简洁又明了，群众说：“技术画上墙，好似百宝囊，技术样样有，真是活课堂，看画又念诗，明了如指掌。”
    在这里，我们有一个最深刻的印象：司集乡的诗永远作不完，司集乡的歌儿永远唱不完。这里的群众做什么就创作什么诗，做什么就唱什么歌。他们把这种创作方法叫做“望风采柳”，“照风挂牌”。他们把诗歌当作政治鼓动的工具，劳动之中出诗歌，所以政治任务越大，劳动越紧张，诗歌创作也越多，歌儿唱得也越欢。
    今年春天，中共司集乡党委书记徐守勤，为了鼓舞干部和群众在大跃进中的干劲，他首先写了一首墙头诗：“好的我就学，快的我紧追；人骑快马，我驾火车；别人跑步走，我就插翅飞。”为人们传颂一时。后来，便在乡干部会上，结合对中心工作的宣传进行创作了。徐守勤创作了打破大家迷信的诗：“诗满墙头歌连片，人人进学把书念，坚决冲破文化关，作家诗人田头见。”这样一提倡，在5月份，全乡创作便形成了高潮。全乡在夏天有一百多天没有落雨，群众日夜抗旱，但是二十多万首诗歌，绝大多数正是产生在这个时间内。针对着鼓舞人们抗旱的干劲，干部开会、下乡检查工作，都进行创作；群众在田间劳动就你一句我一句“凑”起来，全乡二百六十七小队变成了二百六十七个诗歌创作小组。他们彼此竞赛对唱，鼓舞斗志，坊集社在5月份组织了青年老年歌咏竞赛晚会，一个晚上就创作了三百多首。他们创作了“车不能车用桶挑，桶不能挑用瓢舀，舀也舀不到地下掏，滴水也要润禾苗”的战歌，向干旱奋战，家家户户都把洗脸洗锅的水都存起来用在田里；全乡打了二万八千多眼井，平均每户便打了一眼以上的井。他们把十三华里长的一条干沟一夜挖成了小河，他们写道：“干沟一夜变成河，天上王母好害羞，开河比我撤河快，如今老身甘认输。”8月初，全乡把百里外的巢湖水，凿渠引上了黄山，他们又唱：“黄山三百六十洼，巢湖三百六十岔，一山一水百里远，如今两家并一家。”他们就是在整整一百多天的日夜抗旱中，用诗歌鼓舞着劳动，在劳动中又创作了大量的诗歌。他们终于战胜了干旱，保住了丰收。
    司集乡群众现在创作和歌唱的热情，越来越高涨了，石桥社的社主任张春政五个月来已创作了九百多首诗歌，他计划今年要创作一千五百首到二千首，其他乡社干部和群众，也人人都有一个惊人的创作计划，全乡今年要向创作百万首诗歌的目标奋斗。文艺的神秘感，在他们面前完全被打破了。在这里，人们会感觉到：“作家千千万，李杜（李白杜甫）也平常。”在这里，人们会感觉到，通过诗歌等文化活动，人们的集体主义精神在成长。在这里，人们还会感觉到，诗歌是体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的产物，共产主义文艺的萌芽产生了，它不但会在司集乡永远兴旺下去，而且将在全国所有城乡永远兴旺下去。（附图片）
