Changes in Heaven and Earth Depend on Human Transformation
Wang Xiaochuan, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Guizhou used to be known as a barren area, but now people no longer see it that way. In the past, people said that here "the sky is never clear for three days," but now people say that here "the climate is warm and the four seasons are like spring." In the past, people said that here "the land is never flat for three miles," but now people say that here "there are many mountains and many treasures." This is partly due to geologists proving that rich treasures are buried here, but more importantly, it is because the people here have "high aspirations despite being poor," have mustered their energy, and have strived to be among the best in many aspects.

Before liberation, it was appropriate to call this place a barren mountain area, given the objective conditions at the time. At that time, each person's annual food ration was less than 200 jin. They wore palm-bark clothing and covered themselves with rice seedlings, their ragged state beyond description. Industry was a blank page here. The economy was backward, and so was culture; it was hard to find a literate person outside the county seat. Malaria was rampant, constantly plaguing the people, who therefore called this place "barren land, a region of miasma." These were the realistic depictions of this place before liberation.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Guizhou worked hard to build a new Guizhou, rapidly changing the poverty of the past. Since liberation, grain production has risen sharply, and the people of Guizhou have cheered for increased grain production every year. Especially this year, grain production has reached 21 billion jin, doubling last year's output, which is seven times that of 1949, averaging 1,300 jin of grain per person. Steel production has gone from nothing to something. Last year, more than 6,000 tons of pig iron were produced, and this year it has jumped to over 550,000 tons, with more than 20,000 tons of steel produced. Although the foundation of the machinery industry is weak, "small factories have accomplished big things." This year, rolling mills and trucks were manufactured. A large-scale machinery industrial base is being built in Huishui County. All the young and middle-aged people in the province have shed the label of illiteracy, and diseases that seriously endangered the health of the people of Guizhou, also known as miasma, have been basically eradicated. Guizhou has rich mineral deposits and will become the non-ferrous metal province of the motherland, primarily an aluminum province. The largest aluminum industry joint enterprise in the country has already started construction; countless copper counties, aluminum counties, fir counties, hemp counties, flue-cured tobacco counties, tea counties, citrus counties, apple counties, etc., will appear one after another. Now, "barren mountain area" has become a historical term. A more accurate term should be: prosperous Guizhou.

Guizhou Province has undergone tremendous changes from poverty to prosperity. It is appropriate to call these changes earth-shaking. Heaven has changed, and so has the earth. And the force that changed all this is people, the people under the leadership of the Party. The change in the people's thinking is the most fundamental force for all changes in human society. Socialist society is an era in which people's subjective initiative can be brought into play more than in any other era. The power of the masses is immeasurable. Once they liberate their minds, muster their energy, and under the leadership of the Party, people can accomplish anything. Isn't the miracle of "one day equals twenty years" appearing on various construction fronts a good proof? The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, has firmly grasped this point, just like all parts of the country. In order to completely change the face of Guizhou, this spring, at the enlarged meeting of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the "Guizhou Backward Theory" was thoroughly broken, focusing on criticizing the "inferiority complex" and right-leaning conservative thinking that existed in the minds of some people. In the summer, at the enlarged meeting of the secretaries of prefectural and state committees, right-leaning conservative thinking was further criticized. After the two meetings, everyone truly recognized what Chairman Mao said in the article "Introducing a Cooperative": "The most prominent feature of China's 600 million people is that they are poor and blank. This seems like a bad thing, but it is actually a good thing. Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, for action, for revolution. A blank sheet of paper, without burden, is easy to write the newest and most beautiful words, easy to draw the newest and most beautiful pictures," recognizing that "the poor have particularly high aspirations." They let go and mobilized the masses, enabling the people to express their particularly high aspirations. The thinking of the people of Guizhou has changed, and people have mustered their energy and strived to be among the best. As a result, Guizhou Province has shown an unprecedented vibrant new atmosphere.

In this year, the spiritual outlook of the people of Guizhou has greatly changed. Whether in the fields, by the blast furnaces, or on the construction sites, there are people who are energetic and full of vigor. Many people from other provinces who have come to Guizhou to visit have a common impression, which is that "the people of Guizhou are really working hard." This impression is real.

The land of Guizhou is barren, and in order to seize grain from nature, the people are fighting day and night, marching towards difficulties. The mountains are high and there is a shortage of water, so they built ponds and dug canals, split mountains and diverted water, and built water conservancy projects that can irrigate more than 15 million mu of land, which is equivalent to 4.8 times the total irrigated area achieved in the past few thousand years before liberation. In order to increase agricultural production, the Tongren area fought with nature, and the people shouted the heroic slogan: "A thousand jin of grain per mu, determination higher than the sky, drain the big river, cut off the barren mountains." After hard work, this year's summer harvest crops achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with more than 111.81 million jin more grain than last year, an increase of more than 80%. In the struggle for steel, the people of Guizhou were even more energetic. Just imagine, how easy is it for a province with the most backward steel production to produce 600,000 tons of iron within a year? Cadres and the broad masses of the province used iron will to overcome all the difficulties in steel production. In September and October, many secretaries of prefectural, county, and district committees stayed by the furnace day and night. Some county party secretaries did not leave the blast furnace for more than 40 days because they could not produce good iron. The peasants were even busier day and night for the sake of steel. Even children of eight or nine years old transported coal and ore for the blast furnace. They proudly said, "The victory on the steel front has our contribution." In those days of continuous rain, on the muddy roads, there were transport armies composed of men, women, old and young walking day and night. It is precisely because the people of Guizhou have such soaring energy that they have won great victories in various production areas.

The more than 16.4 million people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou have the noble quality of "being strong despite poverty." With their soaring energy, they are rapidly changing the face of Guizhou. Changes in heaven and earth depend on human transformation. This sentence is not wrong at all. The changes in people's thinking and the changes in their energy have brought about changes in the face of Guizhou. The year with the greatest changes in the thinking of the people of Guizhou, 1958, is also the year with the greatest changes in the face of Guizhou Province. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the entire province of Guizhou have been mobilized. Although the foundation is poor and there are many difficulties, people have already understood the truth that things are done by people and that people can conquer nature. In a very short period of time, they have done earth-shattering deeds. The people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou have communist consciousness. They will never be satisfied with the existing achievements, nor will they allow the various constructions of Guizhou to stop at the present stage. The people of Guizhou deeply understand that although Guizhou is rich, the development work has just begun. Whether in industrial and agricultural production or in culture and education, there is still a considerable distance from advanced provinces. In order to place Guizhou among the advanced ranks of the country, for the sake of tomorrow, the people of Guizhou must work harder to win victory and to be among the best. At the end of September, people's communes were realized in the rural areas of the entire province. Relying on this superior organization, the people of the entire province are taking out the energy of making steel to engage in deep plowing. Leading cadres such as the secretaries of prefectural, county, and district committees, who have just returned from the blast furnaces, are leading the masses to turn to the fields. Next year, the people of Guizhou will demand 50 billion jin of grain from the land and more steel from the mines.

    天变地变，决定于人变
    中共贵州省委宣传部部长　汪小川
    贵州，过去一向被称为贫瘠的地区，可是，现在人们已不再那样看它了。过去人们说这里“天无三日晴”，现在人们说这里“气候温暖，四季如春”，过去人们说这里“地无三里平”，现在人们说这里“山多宝多”。这虽然是由于地质工作者证明了这里埋藏着丰富的宝藏，但更重要的，还是由于这里的人民“人穷志气特高”，鼓足了干劲，在许多方面争得了上游。
    解放以前，人们称这里为贫瘠山区，是合乎当时的客观情况的。那时每人每年的食粮不足二百斤。穿棕衣盖秧被，其褴褛之状难以形容。工业在这里是一张白纸。经济落后，文化也落后，除了县城以外，难得找到个识字人。疟疾可怕地流行着，经年不断，人们曾因此把这里称为“不毛之地，瘴疠之区”。这些就是这里解放以前的写实画。
    解放以后，贵州人民在党的领导下，发奋建设新贵州，迅速地改变了当年的贫困情况。解放以来，粮食产量直线上升，贵州人民年年都为增产粮食欢呼。尤其是今年，粮食产量已达二百一十亿斤，比去年整翻一番，等于1949年的七倍，平均每人有粮一千三百斤。钢铁生产是从无到有，去年生产生铁六千多吨，今年一跃已突破五十五万吨，钢已产二万多吨。机械工业虽然基础薄弱，“小厂办大事”，今年制造出了轧钢机和载重汽车。规模巨大的机械工业基地正在惠水县兴建。全省青壮年摘掉了文盲帽子，危害贵州人民健康严重的疾病，也即被人称之为瘴气的疟疾，基本上扑灭了。贵州有丰富的矿藏，它将成为祖国的有色金属省，首先是铝业省，祖国规模最大的铝业联合企业已在开工兴建；还将陆续出现无数个铜县、铝县、杉木县、麻县、烤烟县、茶叶县、柑桔县、苹果县，等等。现在，“贫瘠山区”已成历史名词。更确切的称呼应当是：富饶的贵州。
    从贫穷走到富裕，贵州省起了巨大变化。称这些变化为翻天覆地的变化是恰当的。天变了，地也变了。而改变这一切的力量是人，是在党领导下的人民。人民思想面貌的改变是人类社会一切变化的最根本的力量。社会主义社会是人的主观能动性比任何时代都能得到发挥的时代。群众的力量是不可估量的，一旦解放了思想，鼓足了干劲，在党的领导下，人们什么事也办得成。目前，在各个建设战线上出现“一天等于二十年”的奇迹不就是很好的证明吗。中共贵州省委在党中央的领导下，和全国各地一样紧紧地掌握了这一条。为了彻底改变贵州的面貌，今年春天，在中共贵州省委扩大会议上，大破“贵州落后论”，着重批判了在一部分人思想中存在的“自卑感”和右倾保守思想。夏季，在地、州委书记扩大会议上，又进一步批判了右倾保守思想。经过两次会议，大家真正认识到毛主席在“介绍一个合作社”一文中所说的：“中国六亿人口的显著特点是一穷二白。这些看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图”，认识到“人穷志气特高”。他们放手发动群众，使人民群众发出特高的志气。贵州人民的思想变了，人们鼓足干劲、力争上游，于是，贵州省出现了前所未有的朝气蓬勃新气象。
    在这一年里，贵州人民的精神面貌为之大变。无论在田间，在高炉旁，在工地上，到处都是精神焕发，干劲冲天的人们。许多外省来贵州参观的人，都有一个共同印象，就是“贵州人民真在苦干”。这印象是真实的。
    贵州土地贫瘠，人民为了向自然夺取粮食，日夜奋战向困难进军。山高缺水，就修塘挖渠，劈山引水，建成了能灌田一千五百多万亩的水利工程，相当于解放前几千年所达到的灌溉总面积的四点八倍。铜仁地区为了农业增产，同自然进行搏斗，人们喊出了豪迈的口号：“亩产千斤粮，决心比天高，戽干大河水，截断荒山腰”。经过苦战，今年夏收作物获得空前大丰收，粮食比去年多收一亿一千一百八十一万多斤，增产80％多。在为钢铁而战的斗争中，贵州人民更是干劲十足。试想一下，一个钢铁生产最落后的省，要在年内生产六十万吨铁，岂是容易。全省干部和广大群众用铁般意志，克服了钢铁生产中的一切困难。9月和10月里，很多地、县、区委书记，日夜在炉旁，有的县委书记因为炼不出好铁，四十多天不离高炉。农民们为了钢铁，更是日夜奔忙，连八、九岁的娃娃，也为高炉运煤运矿，他们骄傲地说“钢铁战线上的胜利，有我们的功劳”。在那些阴雨连绵的日子里，泥泞的道路上，日夜行走着男女老幼组成的运输大军。就是因为贵州人民有这样的冲天干劲，才夺得了各项生产上的伟大胜利。
    贵州一千六百四十多万各族人民有着“穷且益坚”的高贵品质，他们以冲天的干劲，迅速地改变贵州的面貌。天变地变，决定于人变。这句话一点也不错。人们的思想的变化，干劲的变化带来了贵州面貌的变化。贵州人民思想面貌变化最大的一年，1958年，也就是贵州省面貌变化的最大的一年。在党的领导下，贵州全省人民发动了起来，虽基础差、困难多，但是人们已经懂得事在人为，人定胜天的道理，他们在很短的时间内，干出了惊天动地的业迹。贵州各族人民，是具有共产主义觉悟的，他们绝不满足于已有成绩，也绝不会让贵州各项建设停歇在现在阶段上。贵州人民深刻了解，贵州虽然富有，开发工作却刚刚开始，无论工农业生产，或文化教育，与先进省比还有相当距离，为将贵州跻于全国先进行列，为了明天，贵州人民必须加倍苦干，才能争得胜利，才能居上游。9月底，全省农村实现了人民公社化，依靠这个优越的组织，全省人民正拿出搞钢铁的劲头搞深耕，刚从高炉归来的地、县、区委书记等领导干部，又领导群众转战田间。明年，贵州人民要向土地索取五百亿斤粮食，向矿山要更多的钢铁。
