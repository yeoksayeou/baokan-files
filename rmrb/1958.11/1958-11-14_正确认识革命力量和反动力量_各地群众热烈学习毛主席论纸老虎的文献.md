Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 13th: A surge of studying Chairman Mao's important document "On Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" has deeply unfolded among the people of coastal islands and mountainous areas in northwestern Fujian Province.

In recent days, the local CCP committees in various parts of Fujian Province have dispatched responsible persons to deliver reports to cadres, workers, peasants, students, and other residents, explaining the spirit and essence of the document and the great significance of studying it. They have also organized a vast number of cadres and the masses, based on the characteristics of local work and production, to study this important document in depth through various forms such as reading sessions, seminars, and debates, at the head of fields, on boats, next to steelmaking furnaces, by streams washing iron sand, and in charcoal kilns in the high mountains. More than 70,000 part-time theory instructors scattered throughout the townships in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian, using local Red and Expert Schools as bases, widely tutored workers, peasants, and government officials in their studies. Coastal areas such as Lianjiang, Xiapu, and Ningde have trained a large number of theory instructors who have gone deep into the islands and people's communes to tutor fishermen, boat people, and salt workers in conjunction with the communist education movement. The militia teams on the heroic Dongshan Island have taken this document as the content of their political study for the most recent period. The Party schools in Yunxiao County, which hold high the red flag of learning philosophy by all the people, have included Chairman Mao's document as a required document for study.

In the widespread and in-depth study and discussion of this important document by people from all walks of life in various regions, everyone, combined with vivid examples and experiences of their own locality and experience, spoke freely about the brilliance of Chairman Mao's thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers and its great significance, expressing their confidence to accelerate socialist construction with practical actions, to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu Islands, to completely shatter the US imperialist aggression conspiracy and to defend world peace. Chen Tuanjin, a veteran Red Army soldier, Chen Qinfa, an old guerrilla fighter, and a labor model from Dongxiao Township, Longyan County, the old revolutionary base area, after reading this document, nodded repeatedly and said: The fact that we in western Fujian have persisted in the revolutionary struggle since 1928 and achieved victory fully proves that Chairman Mao's thesis is very correct. Many of us have a deep understanding of the truth that Chairman Mao said that the reactionaries' frantic persecution of the revolutionary people is "lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet." Because the more frantic the reactionaries are, the more people they kill, the more their anti-people features are exposed, the faster the people's consciousness is raised, the more people rise up in resistance, and the closer the enemy gets to death. Chen Qinfa et al. said: In 1930, the Kuomintang reactionaries sent three divisions and one brigade of troops to occupy Longyan, raping, looting, and killing everywhere. In Dongxiao Township alone, twenty-three people were killed in one day. But the enemy's slaughter not only could not eliminate the revolutionary forces, but instead made more people run faster to the revolutionary ranks, enabling our revolutionary armed forces in Longyan to rapidly develop from twenty or thirty people into a company, then a regiment, and finally expand into the Red Army's Twelfth Army. Now, the US imperialism paper tiger is again flaunting its fangs and claws and carrying out aggression everywhere. The more it does this, the faster it will be strangled to death by the rapidly awakened people of the world.

The fishermen, salt workers, and militiamen on Dongshan Island, in their study, also used their heroic deeds of coordinating with the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense troops in July 1953 to severely defeat the fully US-equipped Kuomintang troops landing and scurrying under the command of US military advisors, proving the brilliance and correctness of Chairman Mao's thesis. They said: No matter how ferocious the paper tiger looks, in the face of the awakened people, it must be smashed to pieces.

Chen Yinghe, an overseas Chinese returned from abroad in Xiamen City, said in the discussion: After studying Chairman Mao's great document, it has further helped the returned overseas Chinese and overseas compatriots to eliminate "fear of the United States," making us feel even more the glory and greatness of the motherland.

Beijing

Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Beijing is launching a surge of studying "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers." In the last two days, the Party organizations of factories, communes, schools, and government offices have determined specific plans for in-depth study of this important document and have arranged study and discussion time.

The Party Committee of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company held a meeting of propaganda committee members from various general branches and branches on the 12th, deciding to launch a mass study movement throughout the company within the next two weeks, requiring all units to universally organize employees for seminars and discussions; and with the workshop as a unit, the负责人 (responsible persons) of the workshop Party organizations will make reports to the workers. Shijingshan Iron and Steel's employees are very enthusiastic about studying this document, and many people have bought the newly published book "Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers." The military and political university of the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant's tool workshop decided to spend two weeks specifically studying this important document by Chairman Mao.

The Party Committee of the Si Ji Qing People's Commune decided, while rushing to harvest Chinese cabbage, to mobilize peasants to study Chairman Mao's important document, and made arrangements for the study of commune cadres and peasants respectively, requiring cadres of each production station to study the document seriously in the next two weeks, discussing it at least once a week, and for the vast masses of peasants, with the production organization as a unit, students from the People's University of China sent down to the commune will provide popular explanations.

The Party Committees of Beijing's universities and colleges have also made new arrangements for this study. Many schools have decided to concentrate on studying this document in the next two weeks during the time for communist ideological education. The Party Committee of the People's University of China requested that through this study, to understand Chairman Mao's historical materialism viewpoint and dialectical method of analyzing problems, and to closely connect with ideology, connect with our current struggle with US imperialism, use the method of big airing, big contention, and big debate to further liberate thought, and use Chairman Mao's brilliant strategic thinking to arm our minds. The Party Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee held a meeting of propaganda committee members of its affiliated units today, deciding that all government offices should concentrate on studying at fixed times within ten days, and requested that the Party organizations of each unit earnestly lead this study.

Zhejiang

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 12th: The Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee recently issued a notice to Party committees at all levels regarding the study and propaganda of "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers," requiring all Party organizations in the province to immediately organize all cadres to seriously study this important document, and on this basis, carry out propaganda and education to the vast people of the province. The notice also pointed out: This study and propaganda should be carried out in conjunction with the current communist education, as one of the important contents of communist education, to further expose the decadent essence and the outwardly strong but inwardly weak and declining nature of imperialism, especially the US imperialist reactionaries, as well as their doomed future, so that cadres and the broad masses of people can more firmly establish revolutionary confidence and determination and give full play to their soaring revolutionary fighting spirit.

Before this notice was issued, the masses in various places and units in Zhejiang had already automatically studied this document. The Zhejiang Daily and Hangzhou Daily, which published this document on the same day, sold more than 37,000 copies more than usual. Now, these newspapers have become the most treasured reading material for people. Many government officials studied by reviewing and comparing, and some people said: I have read these articles in the past, but I never had such a deep understanding as today. I feel that the future is bright and I have more energy in my body.

Guangdong

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 13th: The Propaganda Department of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee issued a notice on the 12th, requiring all counties and cities to immediately organize the propaganda and study of Chairman Mao's document "On Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" among government officials and the masses. The notice required that, over a relatively long period of time, concentrated study of this document, combined with informal talks and discussions on the international situation, be conducted. Party committees at all levels should organize report meetings in conjunction with the ideological situation of their own units. The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee required that through this study, the broad masses of cadres and the masses should correctly understand the current situation of the struggle in the Taiwan Strait area and the essence of the imperialist paper tiger. The Propaganda Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee had also made arrangements in the district committees and industrial system party committees a few days ago.

After the publication of Chairman Mao's article "On Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers," various government offices, factories, enterprises, schools, and People's Liberation Army units in Guangzhou immediately began studying.

    正确认识革命力量和反动力量
    各地群众热烈学习毛主席论纸老虎的文献
    福建
    新华社福州13日电　一个学习毛主席“论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”重要文献的热潮，已在福建省沿海海岛和闽西北山区各地人民中间深入展开。
    连日来，福建全省各地中共党委都抽派负责人向干部、工人、农民、学生和其他居民等作报告，讲解文献的精神实质和学习这个文献的巨大意义；还根据当地工作和生产特点，组织广大干部和群众在田头、船头、炼钢炉旁、洗铁砂的溪边和高山中的炭窑前，采用读报会、座谈会、辩论会等各种方式，深入学习这个重要文献。散布在闽北山区各乡镇的七万多个兼职理论教员，以当地红专学校为基地，广泛辅导工人、农民和机关干部等进行学习。连江、霞浦、宁德等沿海地区已训练了大批理论教员，深入到各海岛和人民公社，结合共产主义教育运动，辅导广大渔民、船民和盐民学习。英雄的东山岛上的各个民兵队，都以这个文献作为最近一个时期政治学习内容。高举全民学哲学红旗的云霄县各乡党校，都把毛主席这个文献列为必学文件。
    在各地各界人民广泛深入学习和讨论这一重要文献中，人人都结合本地、本身的生动事例和经历，畅谈毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断的英明和其伟大意义，信心百倍地要在各个岗位上用加速社会主义建设等实际行动，为解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖等岛屿，彻底粉碎美帝国主义侵略阴谋，保卫世界和平而努力。革命老根据地龙岩县东肖乡老红军战士陈团金、老游击队员、劳动模范陈钦发等在看了这个文献后都连连点头说：我们闽西人民从1928年开始坚持革命斗争取得胜利的事实，完全证明了毛主席的论断非常正确。我们许多人对毛主席所说的反动派疯狂迫害革命人民，是“搬起石头打自己的脚”等真理都有深刻的体会。因为反动派越疯狂、杀人越多，它的反人民的面目就越暴露，人民的觉悟就提高越快，起来反抗的人就越多，敌人亦就越接近死亡。陈钦发等说：1930年国民党反动派曾派了三个师和一个旅的兵力占据龙岩，到处奸淫烧杀，光东肖乡有一天就被杀害了二十三个人。但敌人的屠杀不但不能消灭革命力量，相反的却使更多的人更快地奔向革命队伍，使我们龙岩革命武装力量迅速由二、三十人发展成一个连、一个团，最后并扩大成为红军第十二军。现在美帝国主义这只纸老虎又到处张牙舞爪进行侵略，越是这样，它就将越快地被迅速觉醒起来的世界人民绞死。
    东山岛上的渔民、盐民和民兵们在学习中，也以他们在1953年7月间配合人民解放军海防部队，痛歼在美国军事顾问指挥下、登陆窜扰的全副美式装备的国民党军队的英雄事迹，证明了毛主席的论断的英明、正确。他们说：不管纸老虎外貌如何凶恶，在觉醒了的人民面前，它一定要被打得稀烂。
    厦门市归国华侨陈影鹤在讨论中说：学习了毛主席这一伟大文献后，进一步帮助了归侨、侨胞扫除“恐美思想”，使我们更加感到祖国的光荣伟大。
