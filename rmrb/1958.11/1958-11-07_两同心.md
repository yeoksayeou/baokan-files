    Two Hearts as One
    Li Jishen
    Celebrating the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution, a mighty east wind sweeps across all nations. Gospel spreads, two manifestos ring out, high technology advances, and the three banners soar like a red moon. Good times, justice prevails, and peace is powerful. Marxism-Leninism is promoted. Leading the way to surpass. Magnificent construction, achieving in one day what took twenty years, building a strong陣, with unity of mind and heart. Celebrating this sacred occasion, the world rejoices, a boundless spring scene.

    两同心
    李济深
    庆祝十月革命四十一周年浩荡东风，遍嘘万国。福音布、两个宣言，高科技、三升红月。好时光、正义能伸，和平有力。主义弘扬马列。领先超越。宏敷建、一日廿年，壮营阵、齐心同德。庆圣辰、举世欢腾，无边春色。
