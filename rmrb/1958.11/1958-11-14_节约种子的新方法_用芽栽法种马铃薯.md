    A New Method for Saving Seeds
    Planting Potatoes with Sprouts
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Ministry of Agriculture has summarized and promoted a new method for cultivating potatoes that can save a significant amount of seed potatoes: sprout planting. The potato sprout planting method was first trialed by Ma Qingshan, an experienced farmer in Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province, starting in 1937.
    The potato sprout planting method involves using the sprouts that grow from seed potatoes stored in cellars during the spring. The sprouts are broken off from the potato tubers by hand and used as seeds instead of the tubers. The planting method is similar to planting sugarcane, with the sprouts being buried one after another along the ridges in the field. A medium to large seed potato is typically cut into only three or four pieces, enough to plant three or four hills. However, if the sprout planting method is used, one potato tuber can produce more than a dozen sprouts. According to their local experience, previously, using potato pieces for planting required 3,000 to 3,500 jin (1,500-1,750 kg) of seed potatoes per hectare. With sprout planting, only 1,000 jin (500 kg) of seed potatoes are needed, saving two-thirds of the seed potatoes. At the same time, sprout planting results in a larger number of nodes on the underground stems, leading to the formation of more potato tubers, and the tubers are also larger (generally weighing a quarter to half more than those from piece planting), increasing the unit yield of potatoes. In Bayan County this year, in the first year of trial planting, the yield per unit area generally increased by more than 20%. If viewed in terms of individual plants, some even experienced yield increases of 50% or even doubled.
    Because sprout-planted potatoes form tubers earlier, they can be harvested half a month or twenty days earlier than piece-planted potatoes. This not only reduces the harm from late blight, but also allows the land to be freed up earlier for planting another crop, increasing the multiple cropping index of the land.

    节约种子的新方法
    用芽栽法种马铃薯
    本报讯　农业部总结和推广了一种新的可以节约大量种薯的栽培马铃薯的方法——芽栽。马铃薯芽栽法是黑龙江省巴彦县老农马青山1937年开始试用的。
    马铃薯芽栽方法是用贮藏窖中的马铃薯种薯春季生出的芽苗，用手齐薯块掰下来，代替薯块做种。栽种的方法和种甘蔗相似，把芽一根接一根地顺垅埋种在地里。一个中大型的种薯，不过切三、四块，能种三、四穴；如果采用芽栽方法，一个薯块能生出十几个芽。根据他们这里的经验，以往用薯块种每垧（即一公顷）需要薯种三千到三千五百斤，用芽栽有一千斤薯种就够了，可节省薯种三分之二。同时用芽栽的由于埋在土里的茎部的节数较多，结的薯块较多，薯块也大（一般比块栽的结薯要重四分之一到一半以上），增加了马铃薯的单位产量。巴彦县今年在第一年试栽中，单位面积的产量一般增产20％以上，若以单株来看，有增产50％甚至达一倍以上的。
    由于芽栽的马铃薯结薯早，可以比块栽的提早半个月或二十天收获，所以不但可以减轻晚疫病的为害，还可以早腾出地来多种一季庄稼，提高土地的复种指数。
