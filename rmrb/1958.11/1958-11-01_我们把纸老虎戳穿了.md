    We Have Pierced the Paper Tiger
    Volunteer Army Combat Hero, Wang Zhanshan
    "Comrade Mao Zedong's Thesis that Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" has been published. As soon as I saw this important document, I read it in one breath. The more I read, the more intimate it felt.
    How could I not feel intimate? I am a volunteer soldier who has just returned from Korea. On the Korean battlefield, we personally pierced the paper tiger of American imperialism. When we went abroad to fight, our superiors taught us: American imperialism is a paper tiger, and we will definitely be able to defeat it. This thought penetrated our hearts. In fierce battles, when we thought of this truth, we were a hundred times more courageous. Even when faced with extreme difficulties, our hearts were always bright and full of confidence. Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction has been transformed into our invincible strength. I experienced this most profoundly during the summer offensive campaign of 1953.
    At that time, the enemy had already been beaten and was losing strength, but American imperialism was still dishonest in the negotiations. In order to teach them a lesson, we decided to give them a good beating.
    The offensive campaign began. We broke through the enemy's vaunted "powerful defense line" in one fell swoop, beating the enemy into a state of disarray. We pursued the enemy, leaving their corpses strewn all over the ground, and we even captured their cars with the engines still running. We advanced more than twenty li into the enemy's position in one breath. The enemy was destined to be defeated in the entire campaign, but they still struggled desperately, trying to recapture the lost positions. They bombarded the high ground we were defending with planes and artillery. It looked very fierce, with two battalions attacking our platoon position at most times. Although we were small in number, everyone thought: no matter how fierce you are, you are still just a paper tiger. The paper tiger should not try to be intimidating in front of a real tiger. We resolutely struck the enemy, defeating more with less. Three of us repelled the enemy's charge of a platoon. When we ran out of ammunition, we used stones. In this way, we held our ground for four days and nights, and one company wiped out more than four hundred enemies. A few days later, American imperialism obediently signed the armistice agreement. We have a deeper understanding of the truth that America is a paper tiger. Long-term revolutionary education, especially the practical experience of the Korean War, tells us: American imperialism and all reactionaries are all bluffing and actually weak. As long as we despise them and seriously beat them, they will show their true colors.
    Chairman Mao's thought is great and correct. Studying Chairman Mao's thought can illuminate our hearts, fill us with strength, and enable us to defeat the enemy and overcome difficulties. In the future, I am determined to study Chairman Mao's works even better, arm my mind, and make greater efforts and greater contributions to the liberation of Taiwan and the construction of the motherland's communist society. We despise American imperialism. A paper tiger is always a paper tiger. Don't think that they are still doing evil in the Taiwan region and around the world today, but they are about to be finished. As long as we beat them hard, just like Wu Song beating the tiger on Jingyang Ridge, without being polite to them and without compromising with them, they have no way out!

### 我们把纸老虎戳穿了

    我们把纸老虎戳穿了
    志愿军战斗英雄　王占山
    “毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”发表了。一见到这个重要文献，我就一口气读了下去。越读越亲切。
    怎能不感到亲切呢？我是刚从朝鲜回国的一个志愿军战士。在朝鲜战场上我们就亲手戳穿了美帝国主义的纸老虎。当我们出国作战时，上级就教导我们：美帝国主义是纸老虎，我们一定能够打败它。这个思想深入到我们的心坎上。在激烈的战斗中，想起这个道理，我们就勇气百倍，在非常困难的面前，心里也总是亮堂堂的，充满信心。毛主席这一英明指示，已经化为我们战无不胜的力量。我在1953年夏季进攻战役的战斗中体会得最深刻。
    那时候，敌人已经被打得没了力量，但是美帝国主义在谈判中还是不老实。为了给它一点颜色看，我们决定狠狠揍它一顿。
    进攻战役开始了。我们一举就突破敌人吹嘘的“强大防线”，打得敌人狼狈而逃。我们追击敌人，只打得敌人遍地死尸，汽车马达还响着就被我们缴获了。我们一连气突进敌人阵地二十多华里。整个战役敌人是败定了，可是它还是拚命挣扎。想把丢了的阵地夺回去。它们用飞机、大炮猛轰我们坚守的某高地。看来气势很凶，最多的时候用两个营冲击我一个排阵地。我们人数虽少，但大家都想着：你再凶也不过是纸老虎。纸老虎在真老虎面前就别想逞威。我们坚决打击敌人，以少胜多，三个人就打垮了敌人一个排的冲锋。我们弹药少了，用石头打。这样，我们坚守四昼夜，一个连消灭敌人四百多。过了几天，美帝国主义就乖乖的在停战协定上签了字。美国是纸老虎的道理，我们体会得更加深刻了。长期革命的教育，特别是朝鲜战争的实际体验，都告诉我们：美帝国主义和一切反动派，都是吹得很凶，实际上虚弱。只要蔑视它而又认真的去揍它，它就会现原形。
    毛主席思想是伟大的，正确的。学习毛主席思想，就能照亮心坎，使自己浑身都是力气，就能战胜敌人，战胜困难。今后我决心更好学习毛主席著作，武装自己头脑，为解放台湾，建设祖国共产主义社会作更大努力，作出更大贡献。我们藐视美帝国主义。纸老虎总是纸老虎。别看今天还在台湾地区、在全世界作恶，但他们已经快完蛋了。只要我们狠狠地揍它，就像武松当年在景阳冈打虎一样，不同它客气，不同它妥协，它是没有什么出路的！
