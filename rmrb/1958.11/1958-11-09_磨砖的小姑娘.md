    The Little Girl Who Grinds Bricks
    Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory, Xiang Yang
    This little girl is named Sun Yumei. She is only sixteen years old, not very tall, and not particularly strong. She grinds refractory bricks on the steel construction site of the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory. At that time, out of the three hundred-plus brick grinders, aside from the twenty-odd experienced masters, all were newly arrived apprentices; no one knew how to grind. Of course, the bricks were as hard as iron, and it took a lot of effort to grind just one brick a day; even the best hands only managed two. When Sun Yumei learned that the blast furnace needed more than 25,000 bricks and that the deadline was very tight, she thought, "When will we ever be able to grind them all!" So, she paired two large bricks, each weighing seventeen or eighteen jin, together to grind. The skin on her fingertips was worn away by the bricks, and the skin underneath glistened with beads of blood. She gritted her teeth and refused to stop for even a second.
    Once, she got sick. She felt dizzy and had a fever. Her comrades told her to go to the clinic to see a doctor, but she pouted and said, "Going to the doctor, if there are a lot of people, I'll have to wait half an hour. With that half hour, I can at least grind two bricks."
    One evening, her older brother was getting married. Sun Yumei wanted to ask for leave to go home and see her new sister-in-law; her mother and brother had told her long ago that she had to go back no matter what… But, when she heard that the brick grinding team was going to work the night shift, she didn't ask for leave. She said: Can steel production wait for a holiday?

    磨砖的小姑娘
    青岛纺织机械厂　向阳
    这个小姑娘叫孙玉美，才十六岁，个子不高，身体也不算强。她在青岛纺织机械厂钢铁工地上磨耐火砖。那时候，三百多磨砖手除了二十多个老师傅之外，都是才进厂的徒工，谁也不会磨。本来是嘛，砖硬得和铁一样，费很大劲一天才磨一块，好手也只磨到两块。孙玉美一打听，听说高炉要用二万五千多块砖，要得又很急，就想：“这得什么时候才能磨出来呀！”她就把两块十七、八斤重的大砖对到一起磨，手指头上的表皮被砖磨去了，里边的皮明亮亮的含上了血珠。她咬着牙一分一秒都不肯停。
    有一次，她病了。头晕，发烧，同志们叫她到医务所去看看，她噘了噘嘴，说：“看病，遇上人多，一等半个钟头，我有这半个钟头，至少也能磨两块砖。”
    有一天晚上，她哥哥结婚。孙玉美想请假回去看看新来的嫂子；母亲和哥哥早就嘱咐过了，无论如何得回去……可是，一听说磨砖队要打夜班，她就不请假了。她说：钢铁还能等放假吗？
