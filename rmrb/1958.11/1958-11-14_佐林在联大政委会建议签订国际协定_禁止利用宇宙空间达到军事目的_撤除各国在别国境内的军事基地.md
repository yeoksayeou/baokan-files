Xinhua News Agency, November 13th - According to TASS, New York: Yesterday, the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the issue of peaceful uses of outer space. On the agenda were the Soviet delegation's proposals on prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes, withdrawing military bases in other countries, and international cooperation in exploring outer space, as well as the "International Cooperation Plan in Outer Space" proposed by the United States representative.

    Zorin, head of the Soviet delegation, spoke first. He said that the scientific and technological problem of overcoming the Earth's gravity had been solved thanks to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial Earth satellite. Now the road to the universe has been opened to mankind.

    Zorin accused the American ruling circles of using "space war" to intimidate the people of the world. He said that the propaganda machines of certain Western countries, especially the United States, were vigorously promoting plans to attack the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries through outer space. American government officials and military personnel are increasingly talking about establishing American control over the moon and the entire outer space. They are attempting to use outer space for military purposes.

    Zorin pointed out that concluding an agreement prohibiting nuclear weapons would solve the problem of peaceful uses of outer space, because the real danger is not the rockets themselves, but the nuclear warheads the rockets deliver. He pointed out that the United States has deployed nuclear weapons and rockets with nuclear warheads at its military bases in other countries. This situation cannot help resolve the issue of the peaceful uses of outer space.

    Zorin suggested signing a broad international agreement, which should include the following main principles:

    1.  Prohibit the use of outer space for military purposes; all countries can only launch rockets into outer space according to agreed international plans.

    2.  Withdraw military bases in other countries, first of all the bases in Europe, the Near and Middle East, and North Africa.

    3.  Conduct corresponding international supervision within the framework of the United Nations over the implementation of the above obligations in items 1 and 2.

    4.  Establish a United Nations international cooperation agency for research into outer space.

    Zorin also exposed the United States' conspiracy to only prohibit intercontinental rockets while setting aside the issue of bases and other important aspects of this issue. Zorin said that it is not difficult to see that the true intention of this proposal is to prohibit or supervise the use of intercontinental ballistic missiles, while on the other hand, it retains its military bases on the territories of other countries in order to continue to do whatever it wants and threaten the security of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries.

    Zorin demanded that the United Nations adopt a resolution that would guarantee the security interests of all countries.

    American representative Lodge rehashed his slanders against the Soviet Union and Hungary and quibbled to defend the United States' retention of military bases on the territories of other countries.

    Zorin spoke again, refuting Lodge's absurd arguments.

    Hungarian representative Peter also refuted Lodge's slander. He said that whenever the United States delegation cannot express any opinion on the substance of the issue under discussion and finds itself in an awkward situation, its representatives resort to shameless slander against Hungary.

    Representatives from Chile and Italy also spoke at the meeting.

    佐林在联大政委会建议签订国际协定
    禁止利用宇宙空间达到军事目的  撤除各国在别国境内的军事基地
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：昨天联合国大会政治委员会开始讨论关于和平利用宇宙空间的问题。会议议程上有苏联代表团提出的关于禁止利用宇宙空间来达到军事目的、撤除各国在别国境内的军事基地和关于在研究宇宙空间方面进行国际合作的建议，还有美国代表所提出的“在宇宙空间方面的国际合作计划”。
    苏联代表团团长佐林首先发言。他说，由于苏联发射第一个人造地球卫星，克服地心引力的科学技术问题已经解决了。现在人类通向宇宙的道路已经打开了。
    佐林指责美国统治集团用“宇宙战争”来恫吓世界人民。他说，某些西方国家，特别是美国的宣传机器大肆鼓吹通过宇宙空间进攻苏联和其他爱好和平国家的计划。美国的政府人士和军界人士越来越经常地谈论建立美国对月球和对整个宇宙空间的控制计划。他们企图利用宇宙空间来达到军事目的。
    佐林指出，缔结禁止核武器的协定就会解决关于和平利用宇宙空间的问题，因为真正危险的不是火箭本身，而是火箭送出的核弹头。他指出，美国在其他国家境内的军事基地上配置了核武器和带核弹头的火箭。这种情况绝不能有助于关于和平利用宇宙空间的问题的解决。
    佐林建议签订广泛的国际协定，这项协定应包括下列各主要原则：
    1、禁止利用宇宙空间来达到军事目的，各国只能根据商定的国际计划来向宇宙空间发射火箭。
    2、撤除各国在别国境内的军事基地，首先是在欧洲、中近东和北非的基地。
    3、在联合国范围内对上述第1和第2项义务的履行情况进行相应的国际监督。
    4、建立联合国在研究宇宙空间方面的国际合作机构。
    佐林还揭露了美国建议只禁止洲际火箭而把基地问题和这个问题的其他重要方面抛在一旁的阴谋。佐林说，不难看出，这种建议的真正意图在于禁止或者监督洲际弹道火箭的使用，而另一方面却保留它在别国领土上的军事基地，以便继续为所欲为，威胁苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的安全。
    佐林要求联合国通过一项能够保障所有国家的安全利益的决议。
    美国代表洛奇重弹了他诬蔑苏联和匈牙利的陈词滥调，并且为美国在别国领土上保留军事基地进行诡辩。
    佐林再次发言。驳斥了洛奇的荒谬论点。
    匈牙利代表彼得也驳斥了洛奇的诬蔑。他说，每当美国代表团对所讨论问题的实质发表不出任何意见而处境狼狈的时候，它的代表就对匈牙利进行厚颜无耻的诬蔑。
    在会上发言的还有智利和意大利的代表。
