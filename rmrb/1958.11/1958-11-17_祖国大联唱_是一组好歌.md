"Motherland Medley" is a Good Set of Songs
Southwest Normal University Student Liao Yanxun

The "Motherland Medley" published in the 12th issue of "Songs" in 1958 is a good set of songs. It was collectively created by poets Wang Yafan, Sha Ou, Ding Li, and composers Li Huanzhi, Sun Shen, Zhang Lu, and Li Qun. This set of songs reflects the new atmosphere of the motherland in 1958 from various aspects, enthusiastically praising the soaring enthusiasm and heroic spirit of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party, and also looking forward to the beautiful tomorrow of the motherland from these mythical deeds, which makes us generate greater enthusiasm for building a socialist motherland.

Although the tunes of this set of songs were written separately by four composers, each with unique techniques and styles, the overall sound is still harmonious and unified, and the structure is quite coherent and complete.

The first song, "Poetic Motherland, Motherland of Song," is a chorus. It is written very smoothly, kindly, and accessibly. The entire melody of this song feels very familiar and natural to sing.

The second song, "Ode to Steel," uses a fast rhythm to express our steel will to surpass England in a short time and our heroic spirit of riding fast. In the progression of the melody, the author used many octave jumps, a simple and bold folk song technique, to express the heroic spirit of the steel warriors.

The third song, "Fieldside Serenade," uses various performance forms such as solo singing, unison singing, and mixed chorus to enthusiastically sing the infinite joy and excitement of our agricultural bumper harvest. The melody is unique, beautiful, and very rich in local flavor. The characteristic of the music is to express the emotion of the song with the true feelings of the laborers. When you hear the soloist sing "Why does it grow so well," you will inevitably echo and sing "Grows so well." In addition, the sounds of labor chants are set off in the pleasant and beautiful musical phrases, making this song express the excitement of the harvest from beginning to end.

The fourth song, "Dare to Think, Dare to Do," is basically a male duet. The theme melody is very simple, but the author makes the duet and chorus interweave and combine, which seems very rich and interesting, like a group of laborers having an interesting conversation together. There are speeches by individual figures, and there are also responses from the masses. This conversation fully demonstrates the optimism and heroic style of the working people. The melody of the young people (tenor) is lively and energetic, and the melody of the elderly (bass) is solid and steady. These two themes have distinct and colorful contrasts in terms of modal color, rhythm, and the timbre of the performers, but they are also unified and harmonious, especially in the combination of the duet, which achieves a high degree of artistic effect.

The fifth song, "The East Wind Overwhelms the West Wind March," appears in the style of a march. It shows that the unity between China and the Soviet Union is unparalleled and strong. The rhythm is firm and powerful, and the strict melody is full of enthusiasm. The theme of the song is clear and easy to remember.

The last song of this "Medley," "The Motherland's Tomorrow," is worth mentioning in particular. Through the singing of the above five songs, we have seen the brand-new face of the motherland. This song, through its rich ideological content, full harmony, and beautiful and lyrical melody, visualizes our ideals and draws a beautiful picture for us. When singing "Red factories in green trees, the roar of machines resounds across the fields, everyone is a versatile hand, working, farming, and writing poems," how exciting is that labor scene! Singing such songs, our mood is comfortable and beautiful, our blood is boiling, we love our motherland even more, and we are more enthusiastic about building socialism.

The poets who wrote the lyrics absorbed the advantages of the new folk songs, summarizing the most exciting phenomena in real life and elevating our spirit to a more comfortable and beautiful realm. In terms of melody, the entire medley is permeated with the temperament of folk music, and the combination of lyrics and music is very good. These songs can also be sung separately, which is very suitable for the needs of the masses. In today's great development of the socialist singing movement, we sincerely expect song writers to create more works of this kind that are popular and have improved ideologically and artistically.

    “祖国大联唱”是一组好歌
    西南师范学院学生　廖衍勋
    发表在“歌曲”1958年十二期上的“祖国大联唱”是一组好歌。它是由诗人王亚凡、沙鸥、丁力和作曲家李焕之、孙慎、张鲁、李群集体创作的。这组歌曲从各方面反映了祖国在1958年中出现的新气象，热情洋溢地歌颂了在党领导下的中国人民的冲天干劲和英雄气概，也从这些神话般的事迹中展望出祖国美好的明天，使我们产生了建设社会主义祖国的更大热情。
      这一组歌曲的曲调虽是四个作曲家分别写成的，各有独特的手法和风格，但整个听起来仍然是和谐、统一的，在结构上也相当连贯、完整。
    第一首歌曲“诗的祖国、歌的祖国”是齐唱曲。写得十分流畅、亲切而又平易近人。这支歌的整个旋律唱起来使人感到很熟悉很自然。
    第二首歌曲“钢铁颂”，作者运用了的节奏，来表现我们要在短时间超过英国的钢铁意志和快马加鞭的英雄气概。旋律的进行，作者用了很多八度上下跳进的淳朴、粗犷的民歌手法表现了钢铁战士的豪迈的气概。
    第三首歌曲“田头小唱”则是以领唱、齐唱、混声合唱等多种演唱形式，热情地唱出了我们农业丰产的无限喜悦和兴奋的心情。旋律别致、优美，很富于乡土风。音乐的特点是以劳动者的真实感受来表达歌曲的感情。当你听到领唱者唱出“为什么就长得这样好”时，会情不自禁地和应着唱出“长得这样好”。此外，在舒畅优美的乐句叙述中，衬托有劳动号子的声音，使这首歌曲从头至尾表现了丰收的兴奋心情。
    第四首歌曲“敢想敢干”基本上是一首男声对唱曲，主题旋律很简单，但作者使二重唱和合唱穿插组合起来，就显得非常丰富有趣，好像是一群劳动者在一块进行一场有趣的谈话。有个别人物的发言，也有群众的和应。这场谈话完全显示了劳动人民的乐观情绪和英雄风格。青年人（男高音）的旋律活泼有朝气，老年人（男低音）的旋律坚实、沉稳，这两个主题在调式色采上、节奏上及演唱者的音色上都具有鲜明多采的对比，但它们又是统一谐和的，尤其在二重唱的结合中达到了高度的艺术效果。
    第五曲“东风压倒西风进行曲”是以进行曲风出现的，它表现了中苏两国的团结是无比强大和坚强有力的。节奏坚实雄厚，在严谨的曲调中饱含着热情，歌曲的主题鲜明易记。
    这个“联唱”的最后一曲“祖国的明天”值得特别一提，通过上面五首歌曲的演唱，使我们看到了祖国崭新的面貌，这首歌曲通过充实的思想内容，丰满的和声，优美抒情的旋律，把我们的理想形象化了，为我们构画了一幅美好的图景，当唱“绿树丛中红厂房，轰隆隆的机声遍田间，人人都是多面手，做工耕田写诗篇”的时候，那种劳动场景是多么令人兴奋啊！唱着这样的歌曲，我们的心情舒畅、美好，我们的热血沸腾，我们更加热爱祖国，更增加了我们努力建设社会主义的热情。
    写歌词的诗人们吸取了新民歌的优点，既概括了现实生活中最激动人的现象，又把我们的精神提到更舒展更美好的境界。在曲调方面整个联唱都渗透了民间音乐的气质，词曲结合得很好。这些歌曲分开来也可以单独演唱，很适合群众的需要，在社会主义歌唱运动大展开的今天，我们衷心地期待歌曲作家们能多创作这一类通俗的、而且在思想性、艺术性上又有所提高的作品。
