Jilin, Lanzhou Chemical Enterprises Become Comprehensive Enterprises Integrating Steel, Construction, Machinery, etc.
    Breaking Through Professional Restrictions to Advance Towards Universal Factories

    (Our newspaper, Changchun, 19th) In implementing the policy of "one factory, multiple capabilities; one material, multiple uses; one person, multiple skills," Jilin Chemical Industrial Company has gradually transformed from a single basic chemical joint enterprise into a comprehensive heavy industrial joint enterprise that includes steel, machinery, building materials, and other industries, with basic chemicals as its mainstay. This has opened up new prospects for large-scale enterprises to develop in a comprehensive direction.

    Jilin Chemical Industrial Company realized during this year's Great Leap Forward that if enterprises continued to rely on requesting funds, equipment, and steel and cement from higher authorities and depended on state subsidies for development, it would be impossible to meet the requirements of "more, faster, better, and more economical." Therefore, it resolutely established its own necessary basic industrial departments and increased the variety of products beyond chemicals. Since May, it has successively built a steel plant, a chemical machinery plant, and a building materials plant. The original three major chemical plants have also established a number of small satellite factories related to chemical production, such as chemical instrument and chemical analysis instrument production departments in the fertilizer plant. The steel plant that has already been established is designed to produce 100,000 tons of pig iron and 200,000 tons of steel annually. It can roll steel products such as shaped steel, round steel, thin plates, and seamless steel pipes, and is preparing to produce stainless steel, silicon steel, draw copper wire, and roll aluminum plates. The chemical machinery plant is currently under construction while also producing. Its scale is rare in the country. Once completed in April next year, it will produce industrial equipment for chemical fertilizers, organic synthesis, etc., sufficient to equip three or four large-scale chemical plants like Jilin. The building materials plant has already begun supplying various products such as cement, precast concrete components, refractory bricks, and red bricks for the construction of various factories. In addition to the production part, this enterprise also has a set of technical strengths in research, design, construction, and installation, taking care of its own engineering design and research work. This allows the joint enterprise to tap its potential, scale technological peaks, make the most of materials, and fully utilize human resources, the result of which will inevitably be high-speed production development.

    Adapting to the trend of "one factory, multiple capabilities; one material, multiple uses," and developing in a comprehensive direction, a trend of "one person, multiple skills" has naturally emerged among the workers. They learn and master multiple technologies, gradually transforming from single specialization to all-rounders.

    (Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 19th) Lanzhou Chemical Factory has broken through the limitations of specialized production and is developing the original specialized factory, which was designed to only produce chemical fertilizers, synthetic rubber, capron, and other chemical products, into a universal factory capable of producing more products such as steel, machinery, and building materials.

    After this factory develops into a universal factory, in addition to the chemical part, it will have a complete production system from coking, steelmaking, steel rolling, and machine manufacturing. Next year, it will be able to produce 50,000 tons of steel, 35,000 tons of shaped steel and steel plates, 10,000 tons of seamless steel pipes, and 20,000 tons of machines and equipment.

    The existing motor repair workshop, after a short period of expansion, can become a "multi-faceted" workshop that can both repair and manufacture electromechanical equipment. Next year, it plans to produce 500 motors with a total capacity of 20,000 kilowatts. Most of the slag and cinder from the steel plant's iron smelting and steelmaking will be used by a simple cement plant to manufacture cement, which can produce tens of thousands of tons of cement of around grade 400 annually. A small portion of the slag will be used to make slag wool using simple methods. In addition, a semi-native and semi-foreign refractory material plant will also be built.

    Currently, the steel plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel has been completed and put into production. The machinery plant is already manufacturing chemical equipment such as filters in the open air before the new factory building is completed. The coking plant has also started production using indigenous methods, and basic construction will be carried out later. The sites for five factory buildings, including rolling steel and machinery, have been surveyed, and the civil engineering work will be completed before the end of the year.

    In September of this year, when Vice Chairman Zhu De inspected Lanzhou, he instructed: In the future, specialized factories should develop into universal factories, not just produce one thing. Vice Chairman Zhu hoped that Lanzhou Chemical Factory would rely on its own steelmaking to manufacture machine equipment. These instructions greatly encouraged the workers of Lanzhou Chemical Factory, and they immediately took action.

    In addition to the machinery factory using semi-native and semi-foreign machine tools, many indigenous methods will also be used in the construction of other factories and workshops such as cement, slag wool, refractory materials, and coking. In this way, the universal factory can be basically built in just a few months, and the total investment will only be 10 million yuan. (Picture attached)
    Jilin Chemical Industrial Company is stepping up the construction of a medium-sized iron and steel joint enterprise with an annual output of 130,000 tons of pig iron and 200,000 tons of steel, capable of rolling various steel products and producing stainless steel, silicon steel, etc. This is a corner of the construction site of the steel joint enterprise.

    吉林、兰州化工企业建成钢铁、建筑、机械等综合企业
    冲破专业限制向万能厂迈进
    本报长春19日电　吉林化学工业公司在贯彻一厂多能、一物多用、一人多艺的方针中，逐步由单一的基本化学联合企业变为以基本化学为主包括钢铁、机械、建筑材料等工业在内的综合性重工业联合企业，给大型企业向综合方向发展开拓了新的前景。
    吉林化学工业公司在今年大跃进中已经看到，企业如果仍然像过去一样的伸手向上级要资金，要设备，要钢材水泥，依靠国家包干来发展自己，是不可能达到多快好省的要求的。因此，就坚决建立了自己必需的基本工业部门，增加了化工以外的多种产品。从5月开始，已陆续建设了一座钢铁厂，一座化工机械厂，一座建筑材料厂；原有三大化工厂也分别建立了一批和化工生产相关联的小型卫星厂，如肥料厂的化工仪表、化工分析仪器等生产部门。已经建立的钢铁厂，设计年产生铁十万吨，钢二十万吨，能轧制型钢、元钢、薄板、无缝钢管等钢材，并准备生产不锈钢、矽钢，拔制铜丝和压延铝板。化工机械厂目前正在边生产边建设。其规模是全国少有的。明年4月建成后，年产化学肥料、有机合成等工业设备，可装备像吉林这样的大型化工厂三、四个。建筑材料厂已开始供应建设各厂的水泥、混凝土预制构件、耐火砖、红砖等多种产品。除了生产部分外，这个企业还设有研究、设计、建筑、安装等一套技术力量，包办自己的工程设计、研究工作。这就使这个联合企业挖掘潜力，攀登技术高峰，做到物尽其用，人尽其能，其结果必然是高速度发展生产。
    适应一厂多能，一物多用，向综合方向发展，职工群众中自然而然地出现了一人多艺的趋势。他们学习和掌握多种技术，逐渐由单一分工变成多面手。
    本报兰州19日电　兰州化工厂突破了生产专业化的限制，正在把原设计只能生产化肥、合成橡胶、卡普隆等化工产品的专业工厂，发展成为能够出产钢铁、机械、建筑材料等更多产品的万能工厂。
    这个工厂发展成为万能厂以后，除化工部分外，将拥有从炼焦、炼钢、轧钢、机器制造完整的生产系统，明年就可生产出五万吨钢、三万五千吨型钢和板钢、一万吨无缝钢管、二万吨的机器和设备。
    现在有的电机修理车间，经过短时间的扩建后，就可成为既能修理，又能制造机电设备的“多面手”车间，明年计划生产五百台总容量为二万瓩的电动机。钢厂化铁炼钢后的矿渣、炉渣，大部分要由简易水泥厂用来制造水泥，每年可以生产四百号左右的水泥数万吨。一小部分的矿渣将用简易方法制成矿渣棉。此外，还要建设一个半土半洋的耐火材料厂。
    现在，年产五万吨钢的炼钢厂已经建成并投入生产，机械厂在新厂房没有建成前，已先行在露天制造过滤器等化工设备。炼焦厂也已先用土法开始生产，以后再进行基本建设。轧钢、机械等五座厂房已经勘测好厂址，土建工程将在年底以前全部完工。
    今年9月，朱德副主席在视察兰州时，曾指示说：今后专业厂应该向万能厂发展，不要光生产一种东西。朱副主席希望兰州化工厂依靠自己炼钢制造机器设备。这些指示给兰州化工厂职工很大的鼓舞，他们就立即行动起来。
    除了机械厂采用半土半洋的机床外，其它在水泥、矿渣棉、耐火材料和炼焦等工厂和车间的建设中，也将采用许多土办法，这样只要短短几个月时间，就能把万能厂基本上建设起来，全部投资也只要一千万元。（附图片）
