    Why is the Kishi Nobusuke Government So Interested in China's Coastal Defense?
    Commentator of this newspaper
    On October 31st, the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court, in accordance with the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries, sentenced Kinoshita Yoshio, the fishing chief of the Japanese fishing vessels "Kishima Maru" and "Mishima Maru," which invaded our coastal waters and spied on our military intelligence, to four years of imprisonment, and Kinoshita Yukio, the telegraph operator, to three years of imprisonment. It was also ruled that the two Japanese fishing vessels, "Kishima Maru" and "Mishima Maru," be confiscated.
    The "Kishima Maru" and "Mishima Maru" were arrested by our naval vessels in May this year after they invaded the fishing prohibited zone designated by our government. After interrogation, it was found that these two Japanese fishing vessels not only illegally invaded our prohibited fishing zone; but, even more intolerably, they entered China's coastal waters under the direction of the Maritime Safety Agency of the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, using fishing as a cover for military reconnaissance activities. The Japanese militarists' conspiracy to steal our national defense secrets should arouse the vigilance of the people of the whole country. In order to safeguard our national security and the interests of the people, our government's resolute arrest and sentencing of the military spies of Kishi Nobusuke and U.S. imperialism, and the confiscation of their vessels used to commit crimes, is completely correct, reasonable, and necessary. We support this necessary measure of the government.
    In the past six months, some Japanese fishing vessels have repeatedly illegally intruded into China's prohibited fishing zones and military restricted navigation zones to carry out espionage activities, which is by no means accidental. This is an inseparable product of the Kishi Nobusuke government's intensified implementation of its policy of following U.S. imperialist aggression and adopting a hostile attitude towards the Chinese people, and it is part of the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism.
    In February this year, under the direction of the U.S. intelligence agencies stationed in Japan, the Maritime Safety Agency of the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, in order to further deploy reconnaissance work on our coastal military facilities and the dynamics of naval vessels and aircraft, specially convened a meeting of some heads of Japanese fishing companies, forcing some crew members of Japanese fishing vessels to collect our military intelligence. According to the interrogation, when the intelligence agency of the Kishi Nobusuke government forcibly arranged this criminal task, it emphasized that "the current world situation and Sino-Japanese relations may deteriorate," and used excuses such as "defending against the aggression of communist enemy countries" to instruct them to "approach the Chinese coast at all costs, especially the islands in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea," to collect intelligence on the types, movements, and equipment of our naval vessels and aircraft, especially to spy on the military facilities on our coastal islands: fortresses, artillery positions, airfields, barracks, radar and communications equipment, as well as the water depth, bottom quality, and tidal currents near the coast. In addition to equipping Japanese fishing vessels engaged in military reconnaissance activities with precision telescopes and long-range lens cameras, the Maritime Safety Agency ordered Japanese crew members to report the intelligence they had obtained to the Maritime Safety Agency's patrol ships at any time using special codes. The Maritime Safety Agency of the Kishi Nobusuke government has given the Chinese military intelligence collected by Japanese fishing vessels to the intelligence agencies of the U.S. military stationed in Japan more than once.
    Why is the Kishi Nobusuke government so interested in China's coastal defense? Besides being driven by its latent imperialist ambitions and being eager to make trouble, what else can better illustrate this series of conspiracies by the Kishi Nobusuke government? Now it is clear that it is none other than Kishi Nobusuke himself who is sending military spies to our coastal areas to carry out aggressive actions. With both human and material evidence, Kishi Nobusuke has once again exposed his imperialist face. This is a ferocious imperialist face. This face is indeed no different from that of Tojo Hideki, who launched the war of aggression against China. The Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to revive militarism under the guise of "anti-communism" and its aggressive ambitions to once again covet our territory are obvious; the Chinese people cannot but be duly vigilant and pay attention.
    From the fact that Japanese crew members have revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke government, under the direction of the United States, forced Japanese fishermen to carry out espionage activities against our country, it can be seen that the Japanese working people oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of following the United States and being hostile to the Chinese people. This attitude is good, and we welcome it. The Chinese people have always distinguished the Kishi Nobusuke government from the Japanese people, which has once again been proven to be correct and necessary. In the past, although Japanese fishing vessels repeatedly intruded into our prohibited fishing zones to carry out illegal activities, our government, in the spirit of friendship with the Japanese people, has leniently treated Japanese crew members and fishing vessels whose crimes were relatively minor and who showed repentance. The recent release by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau of 122 Japanese crew members and six fishing vessels that intruded into our prohibited fishing zones is a good example. However, we must also seriously warn the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government that if it continues to send Japanese fishing vessels to intrude into our coastal waters to carry out military reconnaissance activities, the Chinese people cannot ignore it in order to safeguard our national security and the interests of the people. The judgment of the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court on October 31st on the Japanese fishing vessels "Kishima Maru" and "Mishima Maru," fishing chief Kinoshita Yoshio, and telegraph operator Kinoshita Yukio, is just the beginning.

    岸信介政府为什么对中国海防这样感兴趣？
    本报评论员
    上海市中级人民法院10月31日根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，判处侵入我国海岸附近、刺探我国军事情报的日本渔轮姬岛丸、美岛丸的渔捞长木下义雄徒刑四年，电报员木下幸男徒刑三年；并判决没收姬岛丸和美岛丸两艘日本渔轮。
    姬岛丸和美岛丸是在今年5月侵入我国政府划定的禁渔区之后，被我海军舰艇逮捕的。经审讯查明，这两艘日本渔轮不但非法侵入我禁渔区；而且尤其令人难以容忍的是，它们是在日本岸信介政府的海上保安厅的指使下，进入我国沿海，以捕鱼为掩护，进行军事侦察活动。日本军国主义者企图盗窃我国国防秘密的阴谋诡计，应引起全国人民的警惕。我国政府为了保障我们国家的安全和人民的利益，对岸信介和美帝国主义的军事间谍断然予以逮捕判刑，并没收其进行罪行的船只，是完全正确、合理和必要的。我们拥护政府的这一必要措施。
    近半年来，一些日本渔轮屡次非法侵入我国禁渔区和军事禁航区进行间谍情报活动，绝非出于偶然。这是岸信介政府加紧推行追随美帝国主义侵略政策、对中国人民采取敌视态度的不可分割的产物，这是岸信介政府恢复日本军国主义的阴谋活动的一部分。
    今年2月，日本岸信介政府的海上保安厅在美国驻日特务机关的指使下，为了进一步部署对我国沿海军事设施和海军舰艇、飞机动态的侦察工作，曾专门召集一部分日本渔业公司的负责人开会，强迫日本渔轮的一部分船员进行搜集我国军事情报的活动。据审讯经过透露，岸信介政府的特务机关在强行布置这项犯罪的任务时，强调
  “目前世界局势和中日关系可能恶化”，并以所谓“防御共产主义敌国的侵略”等作为借口，指使他们不顾一切地“逼近中国沿海，特别是东海、黄海的岛屿”，收集有关我国海军舰艇、飞机的类型、动向、装备等情报，特别是刺探我国沿海岛屿的军事设施：要塞、炮位、机场、兵营、雷达和电讯设备，以及沿海附近的水深、底质、潮流等情况。海上保安厅除了将精密望远镜、远距离镜头的照相机等军事侦察器材配备给进行军事侦察活动的日本渔轮，并且命令日本船员将刺探到的情报随时用专用密码向保安厅的巡视船报告。而岸信介政府的海上保安厅，已不止一次地把日本渔轮所收集的我国军事情报，送给了驻日美军的特务机关。
    岸信介政府为什么对中国海防这样感兴趣？除了为它潜在的帝国主义侵略野心所驱使而蠢蠢欲动，还有什么更能说明岸信介政府这一系列的阴谋活动呢？现在都明白了，派遣军事间谍到我国沿海来进行侵略行动的不是别人，恰恰是岸信介自己。人证物证俱全，岸信介又一次暴露了它的帝国主义面目。这是狰狞的帝国主义面孔。这副面孔和当年挥军侵略中国的东条英机确实毫无二致。岸信介政府借“反共”之名复活军国主义，妄图再次染指我国领土的侵略野心昭然若揭；我国人民不能不加以应有的警惕和注视。
    从日本船员纷纷揭露岸信介政府在美国指使下强迫日本渔民对我国进行间谍情报活动的这一事实来看，日本劳动人民是反对岸信介政府追随美国、与中国人民为敌的政策的。这种态度是好的，我们表示欢迎。中国人民一向把岸信介政府和日本人民区别开来，就再一次被证明是正确的、必要的。过去日本渔轮尽管屡次侵入我国禁渔区进行非法活动，但我国政府本着与日本人民友好的精神，对凡是罪行较轻、悔改表现较好的日本船员和渔轮，都进行了宽大的处理。上海市公安局最近释放侵入我国禁渔区的一百二十二名日本船员和六艘渔轮，就是一个很好的证明。但是，我们也要严重警告日本岸信介政府，如果它继续派遣日本渔轮侵入我国沿海进行军事侦察活动，中国人民为了保障我们国家的安全和人民的利益，不能置之不理。上海市中级人民法院10月31日对于日本渔轮姬岛丸和美岛丸、渔捞长木下义雄和电报员木下幸男的判处，就是一个开始。
