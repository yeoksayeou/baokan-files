    The movement of workers at the Mudanjiang Cement Factory to study Marxist-Leninist theory has been widely launched. Currently, 95% of the workers in the factory are participating in theoretical study. The formation of a high tide in worker theory study has presented new challenges to the leadership: to consolidate and improve theoretical study, tutoring and lectures are needed. However, the Party Committee has few cadres who are detached from production, and their work is also tense. How can this contradiction be resolved? The Party Committee decided to vigorously cultivate Marxist-Leninist theory instructors who are not detached from production among the workers, relying on workers to manage theoretical study. Based on this decision, the Party Committee established a Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office, absorbing ten workers to participate, divided into two teaching and research groups, responsible for guiding cadre and worker study respectively. The Worker Theory Study Guidance Group is entirely composed of workers, who are responsible for lecturing and tutoring workers, and using theory to study theoretical problems raised by workers in their studies and practical problems in production. In addition, the Party Committee also established a Marxist-Leninist data room, providing the teaching and research staff with good conditions for research and lesson preparation.

    However, worker lecturing also developed gradually after a struggle. Initially, workers thought: "I haven't even learned it well myself, how can I lecture on theory? That's impossible!" Some cadres also doubted "whether workers can explain the principles clearly when lecturing on theory." The Party Committee criticized this mystical view of lecturing on theory and focused on cultivating a group of worker theory instructors in the Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office, helping them prepare lessons. The workshops formed worker lecturer groups, mainly led by the branch secretaries. Before lecturing, they collected materials separately, understood workers' ideological problems, and then analyzed and studied together, using theory to explain and provide opinions on the lecture drafts. This method of collective lesson preparation improved the lecturing quality of worker theory instructors. The Party Committee also held training classes to exchange lecturing experiences and organized worker theory instructors to participate in various report meetings held by the Municipal Party Committee.

    With the encouragement and help of the Party Committee, worker theory instructors' lecturing achieved great success. Worker Liu Peishun lectured on "The Issue of Socialist Construction Speed," worker Xiao Liankun lectured on "How the General Line Was Formed," and worker Song Fuxiang lectured on "Criticizing Yugoslav Revisionism," all of which received very good feedback from the workers. Worker theory instructors are good at linking theory with practice and using Marxist-Leninist theory to solve practical problems in production and work. Moreover, they live with the workers, are familiar with production conditions, and understand workers' thoughts. Therefore, the lecture content is rich and lively, not memorizing dogmas or citing terms, the language is easy to understand, and workers can easily accept it. After the Party Committee proposed the call to double cement production, worker Liu Peishun gave everyone a lecture on "Striving for High Speed," using the theory that subjective initiative is the decisive factor in transforming the objective world, using the fact that the factory's production plan had leaped forward seven times to illustrate that doubling cement production was entirely possible. The kiln workers, after listening to his lecture, liberated their minds, improved the equipment, and accelerated the kiln's speed, and sure enough, before National Day, they continuously sent out three "satellites" of doubling cement production. In this way, the confidence of the workers in lecturing was enhanced. Now, the first batch of 84 theory instructors selected from the workers has given more than 120 lectures to the workers, among them the kiln worker Liu Peishun has given more than a dozen lectures.

    Facts have proven that workers can not only study theory, research theory, but also lecture on theory well. Now, the Mudanjiang Cement Factory Party Committee plans to train 170 worker theory instructors with the level of a junior party school within one year. A worker-class theoretical team that is both a producer, a political worker, and a researcher of Marxism-Leninism is growing rapidly.

    一支工人理论教员队伍的形成
    中共牡丹江水泥厂委员会
    牡丹江水泥厂工人学习马列主义理论的运动已经广泛开展。现在，全厂95％的工人都参加了理论学习。工人学习理论高潮的形成，给领导上提出了新的课题：理论学习要巩固提高，就需要辅导和讲课，而党委脱离生产干部少，工作又紧张，那么这个矛盾如何解决呢？党委决定在工人中大力培养不脱离生产的马列主义理论教员，依靠工人来管理论学习。根据这个决定，党委建立了马克思列宁主义教研室，吸收十名工人参加，下分两个教研组，分别指导干部和工人学习。工人理论学习指导组全部由工人组成，他们负责向工人讲课和辅导，并运用理论去研究工人学习中提出的理论问题和生产中的实际问题。另外，党委还建立一个马克思列宁主义资料室，给教研室人员提供了研究和备课的良好条件。
    但是，工人讲课也是经过一番斗争而逐步开展起来的。最初，工人认为：“我学还学不好，叫我讲理论，那能行吗？”干部中也有人怀疑“工人讲理论是否能把道理讲明白”。党委批判了这种对讲理论的神秘观点，并由马克思列宁主义教研室重点培养一批工人理论教员，帮助他们备课。车间以支部书记为主组成了工人讲师团。他们在讲课前分头搜集材料，了解工人思想问题，然后共同分析研究，运用理论加以阐明，对讲稿提意见。这种集体备课的方法，提高了工人理论教员的讲课质量。党委还举办了训练班交流讲课经验，并组织工人理论教员参加市委举办的各种报告会。
    在党委的鼓励和帮助下，工人理论教员的讲课获得了很大的成功。工人刘培顺讲了“社会主义建设速度问题”，工人萧连坤讲了“总路线是怎样形成的”，工人宋福祥讲了“批判南斯拉夫修正主义”等，工人反映都很好。工人理论教员讲课善于理论联系实际，善于运用马克思列宁主义理论解决生产和工作中的实际问题。并且，他们和工人生活在一起，熟悉生产情况，了解工人思想。因此，讲课内容丰富生动，不背教条，不扣名词，语言通俗易懂，工人易于接受。党委提出水泥产量翻一番的号召后，工人刘培顺给大家讲“力争高速度”一课，运用主观能动性是改造客观的决定性因素的理论，以厂里生产计划跃进七次的事实来说明水泥产量加番是完全可能的。看火工人听了他讲课，解放了思想，改进了设备，加快了水泥窑的转速，果然在国庆节前夕连续发出三次水泥产量翻一番的“卫星”。这样，工人讲课的信心增强了。现在，第一批从工人中选拔出来的理论教员有八十四名已给工人讲了一百二十余课，其中看火工人刘培顺就已讲了十几课。
    事实证明，工人不仅能够学习理论，研究理论，而且能够讲好理论。现在，牡丹江水泥厂党委规划在一年内培养出一百七十名具有初级党校水平的工人理论教员。一支既是生产者，又是政治工作者和马克思列宁主义研究者的工人阶级理论队伍正在迅速地成长着。
