    Learning from the Soviet Union, Building a Socialist Motherland
    Dalai Lama
    Today, the people of all nationalities in our country and progressive people all over the world are celebrating the 41st anniversary of the great Soviet October Socialist Revolution with boundless joy.
    The great victory of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history. It created a glorious example for the progressive cause of all mankind, and it pointed out a path of eternal victory for the struggle of the working class and all working people around the world to seek their own liberation. For the past forty-one years, the working class and the broad masses of working people around the world have been advancing from victory to victory along this path. Now, the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union have formed a powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. The existence and growing strength of this camp have fundamentally changed the world situation, with the East wind prevailing over the West wind. This provides a reliable and powerful guarantee for defending lasting world peace and opposing imperialist wars of aggression, and the Soviet Union has made great contributions in this regard. In the past year, the imperialist countries headed by US imperialism have tried every possible means to carry out war provocations and bloodily suppress the national liberation movements of colonial peoples. However, due to the resolute opposition of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, the imperialists' war provocations and aggressive policies have suffered a shameful defeat. The development of many events has proved that the East wind now prevails even more over the West wind.
    The great victory of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution fundamentally eliminated national oppression, fundamentally changed the relations between nationalities, established new relations of mutual trust, unity, and mutual assistance between nationalities, and set a brilliant example of a harmonious and cooperative national family for all nationalities to build together. It opened up an extremely broad path for all nationalities to take the socialist road, rapidly develop their own political, economic, and cultural construction, and completely get rid of the poverty and backwardness left over from history. For the past forty-one years, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the government, the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union have made incomparably great achievements in politics, economy, culture, science and technology, enabling some minority nationalities that were in extremely backward historical stages to leap into socialist society and join the ranks of advanced nations in the world. Minority nationalities that had no written language in the past now not only have tens of thousands of new intellectuals and scientists as well as various experts of their own nationality, but also have newspapers and various publications in their own national languages. All of this fully proves that the path opened up by the Soviet October Socialist Revolution is the path for all backward nationalities to truly seek prosperity and development.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all nationalities in our country are victoriously building a great socialist motherland along the path of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution. With the rapid development of the socialist construction cause of the motherland, the faces of all nationalities in our country are undergoing fundamental and tremendous changes in all aspects. Since last year, the people of all nationalities across the country have launched an unprecedented and massive upsurge of the socialist Great Leap Forward, and the general line for building socialism formulated by the Party Central Committee has given the people of all nationalities tremendous encouragement. In the past year, in the all-round Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, the people of our country have achieved astonishing achievements with soaring enthusiasm. Now, the people of our country are advancing victoriously on the road of building a socialist motherland with heroic steps and magnificent spirit.
    Throughout the entire process of our people's revolutionary struggle and socialist construction, the Soviet people have given us fraternal, selfless, and enormous assistance. This assistance is one of the important guarantees for our victory in the revolution and socialist construction. In the future, we must also better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, further consolidate the unity between all fraternal nationalities, strengthen mutual assistance, and build our great motherland into a strong, multi-ethnic socialist family more quickly and better. We must clearly recognize that the strength, prosperity, and development of the unified, multi-ethnic socialist motherland family is the basic guarantee for all fraternal nationalities in our country to completely get rid of the backward state in all aspects left over from history and embark on the road of prosperity and happiness.

    学习苏联，建设社会主义祖国
    达赖喇嘛
    今天我国各民族人民和全世界的进步人类，都以无比欢欣的心情，庆祝伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命四十一周年。
    苏联十月社会主义革命的伟大胜利，开辟了人类历史的新纪元，它给全人类的进步事业，创造了光辉的榜样；它给全世界的工人阶级和一切劳动人民为谋求自身的解放而进行的斗争，指出了一条永远胜利的道路。四十一年来，全世界的工人阶级和广大劳动人民，沿着这一条道路，正在从胜利走向胜利。现在以苏联为首的社会主义国家，已经形成了一个强大的和平、民主、社会主义阵营。这个阵营的存在和日益强大，根本上改变了世界的形势，东风压倒了西风。这对于保卫世界持久和平和反对帝国主义的侵略战争，提供了可靠而有力的保证，苏联在这方面做出了巨大的贡献。过去一年来，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义国家，曾经千方百计地进行战争挑衅，血腥镇压殖民地人民的民族解放运动，而由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国和全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对，使帝国主义的战争挑衅和侵略政策，遭到可耻的失败。许多事件的发展，证明了现在是东风更加压倒了西风。
    苏联十月社会主义革命的伟大胜利，从根本上消灭了民族压迫，根本改变了民族之间的关系，建立了各民族间互相信任、团结互助的新关系，树立了各民族共同建设友爱合作的民族大家庭的光辉榜样；为各民族走社会主义的道路，飞跃发展本民族的政治、经济和文化建设事业，彻底摆脱历史上遗留下来的贫穷、落后状态开辟了极其广阔的道路。四十一年来，苏联各族人民在苏联共产党和政府的领导下，在政治、经济、文化、科学技术各方面，取得了无比巨大的成就，使一些过去处于极端落后的历史阶段的少数民族，一跃而进入了社会主义社会，跻入了世界先进民族的行列。过去根本没有文字的少数民族，现在不仅有了成千成万的本民族出身的新的知识分子和科学家以及各种专家，而且还有本民族文字的报纸、各种刊物等等。这些都充分证明：苏联十月社会主义革命所开辟的道路，是各落后民族真正求得繁荣和发展的道路。
    我国各族人民，在中国共产党的领导下，沿着苏联十月社会主义革命的道路，正在胜利地建设着伟大的社会主义祖国。随着祖国社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，我国各民族各方面的面貌正在发生着根本性的巨大的变化。去年以来，全国各族人民掀起了空前巨大的社会主义大跃进的高潮，党中央所制定的建设社会主义的总路线，更给了各民族人民以巨大的鼓舞。一年来，我国人民在社会主义建设全面大跃进中，以冲天干劲，取得了惊人的成就。现在我国人民，正以豪迈的步伐，和宏伟的气魄，在建设社会主义祖国的道路上胜利地前进着。
    在我国人民进行革命斗争和社会主义建设的整个过程中，苏联人民给了我们兄弟般的无私的巨大援助。这种援助是我们取得革命胜利和社会主义建设胜利的重要保证之一。今后我们还必须更好地学习苏联的先进经验，进一步巩固各兄弟民族间的团结，加强互相帮助，把我们伟大的祖国更快更好地建设成为一个强大的多民族的社会主义大家庭。我们必须明确的认识到，统一的多民族的社会主义祖国大家庭的强大，繁荣和发展，是我国各兄弟民族彻底摆脱历史上遗留下来的各方面的落后状态，走上繁荣幸福的道路的基本保证。
