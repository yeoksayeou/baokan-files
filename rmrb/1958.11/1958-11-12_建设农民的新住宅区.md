    Building New Residential Areas for Farmers
    After the establishment of the people's communes, some places experienced a contradiction between the scattered residences and the collective production of the communes. To resolve this contradiction, some communes have already begun to establish residential areas and build a batch of houses to concentrate the residences together. This is necessary.
    Scattered residences are a product of the small-scale peasant economy and are not suitable for the current collective economy. This problem was already discovered during the period of agricultural production cooperatives in the past. After the establishment of the people's communes, this contradiction became even more prominent. The people's commune is a large collective, requiring members to be organized militarily, act like combat troops, and live collectively, while scattered residences will affect the smooth implementation of "three-ization." Scattered residences also greatly hinder the unified use of land and the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Rural areas need to gradually achieve urbanization, which requires the construction of concentrated residential areas even more.
    Judging from the current situation, it is also possible to build residential areas. The people's communes not only unified the use of land but also can uniformly adjust houses, which provides a very favorable condition for the construction of residential areas. The broad masses of members have also realized from practice that more concentrated residences are not only conducive to production but also beneficial to their own lives. The adjustment of villages and settlements in the Mengguan People's Commune in the suburbs of Guiyang City has also facilitated production and life and has been warmly supported by the members.
    There are two different methods for building new residential areas. One is to start simply and improve gradually, taking two steps. The Dingji People's Commune in Jiangsu adopted this method. They are now building thatched houses and using a large number of old materials in the construction. More than 10,000 houses cost only more than 20,000 yuan in construction costs. And the members are also very satisfied because these houses are more spacious, have ample light, and have good air circulation than the original ones. The other method of building residential areas is to be extravagant and wasteful and want to build them into "cities" all at once. This method is of course not feasible.
    When building new residential areas, we must also consider the future planning of the residential area. At that time, flowers, plants, and trees should be planted around the residences to realize gardenization... After considering these, whether it is building tile houses or thatched houses, multi-story buildings or single-story buildings, they must conform to this long-term plan. For example, a certain amount of open space should be left around the residences, and flowers, plants, and trees should be planted now if possible. The houses in the residential area should also be diverse and not be "uniform" in one style.

    建设农民的新住宅区
    人民公社建立以后，有些地方发生了住宅分散和公社集体生产的矛盾。为了解决这个矛盾，有的公社已经开始建立居民点，修建一批房屋，让住宅集中在一起。这是必要的。
    住宅分散是小农经济的产物，不适合于现在的集体经济。这个问题，在过去农业生产合作社时期，就已经发现。在人民公社建立后，这个矛盾更加突出。人民公社是个大集体，要求社员组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化，而住宅分散，就要影响“三化”的顺利实行。住宅分散，对于土地统一使用，全面发展农林牧副渔也有很大妨碍。农村要逐步做到城市化，更加需要建设集中的居民点。
    从目前情况来看，建设居民点，也有可能。人民公社不仅统一使用了土地，而且可以统一调整房屋，这给了建设居民点一个非常有利的条件。广大社员也已从实践中体会到，住宅比较集中，不仅有利于生产，而且有利自己的生活。贵阳市郊孟关人民公社调整村寨，也便利了生产和生活，得到了社员的热烈拥护。
    修建新的居民点有两种不同的方法，一种是因陋就简先简单后完善，分两步走。江苏丁集人民公社就采用这个方法，他们现在修的是草房，并且在修建中，利用了大批旧材料，一万多间房屋，只花了两万多元建筑费。而社员也非常满意，因为这些房屋都比原来的宽敞，光线充足，空气流通。建设居民点的另一种方法，是铺张浪费，并想一下就修建成“城市”一般。这种方法当然是行不通的。
    修建新的居民点的时候，还要考虑到未来住宅区的规划，那时住宅的周围应该栽种有花草树木，实现园林化……考虑到这些以后，现在不论修建瓦房还是草房，楼房还是平房，都要符合这个长远规划。例如住宅周围要留有一定的空地，可能时，现在就种上花草树木。居民点的房子也要多种多样，不要“千篇一律”一个样子。
