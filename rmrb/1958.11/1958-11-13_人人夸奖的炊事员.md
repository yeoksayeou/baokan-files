Public Canteen Praised by All

    The Cook Everyone Praises

    The canteen of the First Youth Experimental Farm of Lema Township People's Commune in Shangqiu County, Henan Province, used to be a terrible one. Not to mention changing the variety of food, the commune members simply couldn't get enough to eat. Later, it was discovered that Chen Dianji (a well-off middle peasant), who was the cook at the time, was stealing grain and steamed buns to take home. The commune dismissed Chen Dianji, and Xiong Caiyun, a female member of the Communist Youth League, asked the Party branch to let her be the cook.

    Young people always like to show off their skills on the booming production front, and they are not too willing to do the work of a cook. Xiong Caiyun didn't think so. She said, "If you don't eat well, you can't produce well. Cooking is more important than anything else." In addition, she knew that the dismissed Chen Dianji was watching and laughing at her. This was a serious struggle! She was determined to run the canteen well, so that all the commune members would be satisfied and Chen Dianji would have nothing to say.

    Only ten days after Xiong Caiyun took charge of the cooking, the canteen changed its appearance. She and several other cooks got up before dawn every day and worked until dusk, cleaning the kitchen spotlessly. The dishes and meals were different every day, and every meal had soup and vegetables. They used sorghum flour to make eight kinds of steamed buns, six kinds of soups, and sorghum noodles mixed with green beans, eggplants, and green onions to make fish noodle soup. In particular, the noodles made by Xiong Caiyun were thin, fine, and saved flour. Not only were the commune members satisfied, but the guests, patients, the elderly, and children in the commune were also satisfied. Xiong Caiyun prepared noodles, dumpling wrappers, and sweet soup for these people in the small kitchen, and delivered them to them whenever they wanted to eat. The commune members composed a quick rhyme saying: Xiong Caiyun, a good League member, is not afraid of hardship and loves to study. She is a good youth of the Party, and the food "satellite" has gone up to the sky.

### 人人夸奖的炊事员

    人人夸奖的炊事员
    河南商丘县勒马乡人民公社第一青年试验场的食堂，开始，是个很糟糕的食堂。不要说改变花样，社员们根本吃不饱饭。后来才知道做炊事员的陈殿基（富裕中农）把粮食和馍偷回家去了。公社撤销了陈殿基，女共青团员熊彩云要求党支部，让她当了炊事员。
    青年人总喜欢在轰轰烈烈的生产战线上大显身手，做炊事员工作，不太甘心。熊彩云可不那么想，她说：“吃不好，也生产不好，做饭比什么都重要。”另外，她知道被撤下的陈殿基正在一边看笑话，这是一场严重的斗争啊！她决心办好食堂，叫社员人人满意，叫陈殿基哑口无言。
    熊彩云担任炊事工作才十天，食堂的面貌就改变了。她和其他几个炊事员天天起五更，打黄昏，把厨房打扫得干干净净；几天的菜饭不重样，顿顿有汤有菜。她们用高粱面做成八样馍、六样汤、秫面掺些豆角、茄子、大葱做成鱼面汤。特别是熊彩云做的面条又薄又细又省面。不光是社员吃得满意，社里的客人、病人、老人、小孩也个个满意。熊彩云在小厨房为这些人准备了面条、面叶、甜汤，啥时吃，啥时给送到跟前。社员编快板说：熊彩云，好团员，不怕吃苦爱钻研，她是党的好青年，伙食“卫星”上了天。
