Curses are Useless!
    Bin Fu

    Dulles was at it again a few days ago, flapping his gums and attacking our people's commune system. The Chinese people are building a socialist society with full confidence, so why does the American Secretary of State need to be so "concerned" and so excited? Doesn't this sufficiently illustrate how much weight the actions of that country the United States always pretends not to see actually carry for it, leading to such a rapid and intense "conditioned reflex" from Dulles!

    We've long been familiar with Dulles's fondness for wagging his tongue. Fortunately, there's Washington as a venue for him to spout his nonsense. Otherwise, we might not have realized that what we do would cause such internal panic for the American bosses. Dulles insists on describing the people's communes, enthusiastically and voluntarily created by the Chinese working people, as something "imposed on the 650 million people of the Chinese mainland," a "backward, large-scale system of enslavement." A fine "backward, large-scale system of enslavement"! Everyone knows that this is just a slander imposed on our people's communes by Mr. Dulles. If he insists on calling something the people are happy to do something "imposed" on themselves, we can understand Mr. Dulles's peculiar habit in choosing words. Everyone knows that Dulles has always described the Chinese people's action of liberating their own territory, Taiwan, as an act of "aggression." Even more ridiculous, he supposedly "finds it hard to believe that (the Chinese people's) efforts will succeed or last." As if our every success or victory must first be believed by Dulles. When the Chinese people sent volunteers to Korea, did Dulles believe we would win? He didn't believe it at all, but we won. He even tries to deny the very existence of our glorious People's Republic of China. From this, it's clear that we don't need Mr. Dulles to "believe" anything; if he likes, let him "find it hard to believe" or "not believe" for the rest of his life! The victory of the Chinese people's revolution has never been and will never need to be "approved" by imperialism and all reactionaries. Moreover, the Chinese people have always taught imperialism and all reactionaries some lessons through their own struggles, making them understand some principles.

    Our people, full of confidence and revolutionary optimism, are creating an increasingly happy life with their own hands; workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers are writing hundreds of millions of poems to praise their people's communes. This is an overwhelming torrent that cannot be stopped. In the face of this torrent, Dulles and his ilk may already be terrified, only able to whistle like a lonely night traveler in a graveyard, helplessly engaging in slander and curses. However, Dulles's curses can only lead to the opposite of his subjective desires. Not only can newborn forces never be cursed to death, but they always grow and strengthen from curses. The more Dulles curses, the more it proves that the people's communes, sung about, supported, and created by our 650 million people, have unparalleled vitality, and the more it proves how helpless and fearful the decaying imperialist forces are in the face of the new revolutionary forces! The more the enemy dislikes something, the more we must do it; the more the enemy curses something, the more we must praise it. In this sense, I would support compiling all of Dulles's anti-China curses, as negative teaching materials, together with our national collection of folk songs praising socialism-communism. This would indeed be very interesting; I find that this is exactly the same thing being praised in two completely opposite languages. Dulles, with his extreme hatred and desperate fear, "praised" our great people's communes through gritted teeth. Of course, he uses a different language and harbors a different emotion, but how much more can this disprove the nobility, greatness, and invincibility of our cause.

    Well then, let this Western clown continue to contribute to us from his position as a negative teacher. The Chinese people will be inspired by the curses of this negative teacher with even greater confidence, accelerating the pace of progress.

    诅咒也是白搭！
    宾符
    杜勒斯前几天又大嚼烂舌头，放肆攻击我国人民公社制度。中国人民正满怀信心地建设社会主义社会，何劳美国国务卿如此“关怀”、如此激动呢？这难道还不足以说明：美国向来装作看不见的那个国家的一举一动，对它是有着多大的分量，以致这样迅速而强烈地引起了杜勒斯的“条件反射”！
    杜勒斯最喜欢翻弄舌头，我们早有领教。幸而有华盛顿这么一个场所供他大放厥词。要不然，我们也许还料不到我们自己做的事情，会引起美国大老板如此的内心恐慌。杜勒斯硬把中国劳动人民热情地自愿创建的人民公社说成是“强加在六亿五千万（中国）大陆人民身上的”，是一种“落后的大规模奴役制度”。好一个“落后的大规模奴役制度”！谁都清楚，这只是杜勒斯老爷强加到我们人民公社身上的一种诬蔑。假如他定要把人民自己乐意干的事情说成是人民对自己的“强加”，我们倒也可以理解杜勒斯先生在用词上的那种癖性。大家都知道，杜勒斯向来是把中国人民解放自己领土台湾的行动，说成是“侵略”的行动。更可笑的是，据说他“很难相信（中国人民）这种努力会成功或者持久。”好像我们每一次成功或胜利，都是事先非经过杜勒斯他相信不可似的。中国人民派志愿军到朝鲜，杜勒斯何尝相信我们会胜利？他根本不相信，然而我们胜利了。甚至我们中华人民共和国堂堂的存在，杜勒斯也企图加以抹杀。由此可见，我们一些也不需要杜勒斯先生“相信”，如果他乐意，就让他一辈子“很难相信”或“不相信”吧！中国人民革命的胜利，从来不会得到也不需要帝国主义和一切反动派的“批准”。而且，中国人民从来就是用自己的斗争来教训帝国主义和一切反动派，让它们明白一些道理的。
    我们充满着自信和革命乐观主义的人民，正在用自己的双手创造自己越来越幸福的生活；工农商学兵正在编写数以亿万计的诗歌来颂赞自己的人民公社。这是一股沛然莫之能御的洪流。在这股洪流面前，杜勒斯之流也许已经吓昏了头脑，只能像在坟墓中间孤独夜行者那样吹起口哨，无可奈何地从事诽谤、诅咒的工作。然而杜勒斯的这种诅咒只能走向他的主观愿望的反面。新生力量不但从来不可能诅咒死，而且总是从诅咒中成长、壮大起来的。杜勒斯愈是诅咒，愈是证明我们六亿五千万人民所歌唱、拥护和亲手创建的人民公社具有无比伟大的生命力，愈是证明腐朽的帝国主义力量在新生的革命力量面前怀着多么无可奈何的恐惧！敌人不喜欢的事情我们越是要干，敌人诅咒的事情我们越是要歌颂。从这一意义上说，我倒赞成把杜勒斯所有咒骂中华人民共和国的反面教材同我们全国人民的歌颂社会主义—共产主义的民歌编集在一起。这确是非常有趣，我发现这正是用两种完全相反的语言对同一事物的歌颂。杜勒斯以自己的极端的憎恨、绝望的恐惧，咬牙切齿地“歌颂”了我们伟大的人民公社。当然，他用的是另一种语言，怀的是另一种感情，但这又是多么能够反证我们事业的高尚伟大和不可战胜啊。
    好吧，就让这个西方小丑在他的反面教员的岗位上继续为我们作出贡献吧，中国人民将从这位反面教员的诅咒中激起更大的信心，加速前进的步伐。
