    Hair Cut for Beloved Braids
    The Dagongshan Steel Plant of the Hongqi People's Commune in Yu County, Henan Province, in order to seize steel from time, needed to build many earthen blast furnaces, but there was no hemp fiber. Without hemp fiber, the furnaces could not be built quickly, which worried all the workers in the plant.
    Liu Aiqin and Liu Shuxiang, members of the Communist Youth League in the Second Combat Battalion, came up with an idea in a hurry. Liu Aiqin said, "Let's dedicate our hair to build the furnaces." Liu Shuxiang immediately supported her: "Hair can grow back after it's cut, but if the furnaces aren't built, we can't produce iron." The two of them started immediately, cutting off their beloved braids to use as hemp fiber. One told ten, and ten told a hundred. More than 500 young men and women in the plant all learned from them, and within a day and a night, they all cut off their hair and dedicated it to the blast furnaces. (Attached picture)

    剪掉了心爱的辫子
    河南省禹县红旗人民公社大贡山钢铁厂，为了向时间争钢铁，要修建很多土高炉，可是麻刀没有了。没有麻刀就不能飞快地建炉，这下子可急坏了全厂工人。
    第二战斗营的共青团员刘爱琴和刘叔香，急中生智，刘爱琴说：“咱们献发建炉”，刘叔香立刻支持：“头发献了还能长，炉子建不成就不能出铁”。两人说干就干，把心爱的辫子剪下来当麻刀用了。一传十，十传百，全厂五百多名男女青年，都向她们学习起来，一天一夜的工夫，都把头发剪下来献给了高炉。（附图片）
