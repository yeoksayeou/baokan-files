Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 14th: In a speech delivered in Beni Suef, Egypt Region, on the afternoon of November 14th, the President of the United Arab Republic, Nasser, reiterated the UAR's policy of active neutrality and non-alignment, and expressed support for the struggle of the Algerian and Adenese people for independence.

President Nasser made the speech to a crowd gathered in the square opposite the Beni Suef train station on his way back to Cairo from Minya. He said, "We are friendly to those who are friendly to us, and hostile to those who are hostile to us. We have declared that our policy is one of active neutrality and non-alignment, and we have declared that we neither depend on the Eastern bloc nor the Western bloc."

"Under no circumstances will we agree to belong to any sphere of influence, nor can we agree that any part of the Arab countries belongs to any sphere of influence. Arab countries must be returned to their children, and the sovereignty of Arab countries must also be returned to their children. Foreign rule must end, and the rule of imperialists and occupying forces must end."

President Nasser expressed support for the struggles of the Algerian and Adenese people. He said, "Today we say that the struggle of Arabs in any part of the Arab world is our struggle, and we will participate in the struggle by all means." He said, "When we announced our support for the Algerian struggle, France's reaction was very rude and aggressive, but all of this cannot discourage us, because we are stronger today."

He also said, "Today the imperialists are fighting their last battle in Aden, South Arabia. Every one of us feels that the battle of Aden is our own battle."

He said that during his recent visit to the Soviet Union, he told the Soviet leaders: "We are grateful to countries that do not forget friendship." He said, "I told them that despite the different social systems, we met as friends in their country." He also said that the Soviet leaders said the same to him.

President Nasser, emphasizing the unity among the people, said that spreading discord is the policy and method of imperialism to rule and control us. "But when we stop all this, when we unite, we can drive the occupying forces out of our country." He also said that unity is the basic force that enables us to withstand great wars, resist airplanes and fleets, and deal with economic warfare and propaganda warfare. President Nasser also explained his proposition of a "social democratic cooperative society with the participation of all citizens" and the proposition of a national union.

Early this morning, President Nasser laid the foundation stone for the sports city in Minya, watched students' physical exercises, visited the students' football match, and also visited the school and National Guard camps.

    阿拉伯国家属阿拉伯人  帝国主义统治必须结束
    纳赛尔重申阿联奉行积极中立政策
    新华社开罗14日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔14日下午在埃及地区贝尼苏夫发表的演说中，重申阿联奉行积极中立和不参加集团的政策，并且表示支持阿尔及利亚和亚丁人民争取独立的斗争。
    纳赛尔总统是在从米尼亚返回开罗途中向集合在贝尼苏夫车站对面广场上的群众发表演说的。他说，“我们跟同我们友好的人友好，对敌视我们的人敌视。我们已经宣布，我们的政策是积极中立和不参加集团的政策，我们已经宣布我们既不依附东方阵营，也不依附西方阵营。”
    “我们在任何情况下，都不同意属于任何势力范围，我们也不能同意阿拉伯国家的任何部分属于任何势力范围。阿拉伯国家必须归还给它的子孙，阿拉伯国家的主权也必须归还给它的子孙。外国的统治必须结束，帝国主义者和占领军的统治必须结束。”
    纳赛尔总统表示支持阿尔及利亚和亚丁人民的斗争。他说，“我们今天说，在阿拉伯世界任何部分进行的阿拉伯人的斗争都是我们的斗争，我们要用一切办法参加斗争。”他说，“当我们宣布支持阿尔及利亚的斗争的时候，法国的反应非常粗暴和咄咄逼人，但是所有这一切并不能使我们失去勇气，因为我们今天是更强大了。”
    他又说，“今天帝国主义者在南阿拉伯亚丁打它最后的一仗。我们每一个人都觉得亚丁的战斗是自己的战斗。”
    他说，在他最近访问苏联期间，他曾经对苏联的领导人说：“我们感激不忘记友情的国家。”他说，“我对他们说，尽管社会制度不同，我们是作为朋友在他们的国家中会晤的。”他又说，苏联领导人对他说了同样的话。
    纳赛尔总统在强调人民之间的团结的时候说：散布不和是帝国主义为了统治和控制我们的政策和方法。“但是，当我们制止了这一切，当我们联合起来，我们能够将占领军撵出我们的国家。”他还说：团结是使我们能够经得起大战、抵抗飞机和舰队、对付经济战和宣传战的基本力量。纳赛尔总统还解释了他的“全体公民参加的社会民主合作社会”的主张以及民族联盟的主张。
    今天清早，纳赛尔总统在米尼亚为体育城奠基，观看了学生们的体育锻炼，参观了学生队的足球比赛，还参观了学校和国民警卫队的营地。
