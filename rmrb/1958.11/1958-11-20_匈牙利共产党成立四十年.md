    Fortieth Anniversary of the Founding of the Hungarian Communist Party
    Nógrádi Sándor, Hungarian Ambassador to China

    Forty years ago, on November 20, 1918, the Hungarian Communist Party was founded. It emerged from the revolutionary Hungarian proletariat and was born out of the decades of heroic struggle of Hungarian workers and poor peasants. At that time, the socialist revolution had already triumphed in Russia, and this revolution shook the world. Lenin declared that all over the world, the overthrow of the bourgeois regime and the victory of the proletarian revolution had been put on the historical agenda.
    The causes of the founding of the Hungarian revolutionary workers' party were, in some main characteristics, similar to those of the birth of several other European communist parties. The political organization of Hungarian workers began in 1868. The best members of the Hungarian workers joined the First International organized by Marx and Engels and became a part of it. The first socialist organizations united in 1880 to form the General Workers' Party, which adopted the name Hungarian Social Democratic Party in 1890 and became a member of the Second International.
    At the beginning of the 20th century, the left wing within the Social Democratic Party began a struggle against the right wing. These right-wing elements adopted the positions of Bernstein and the revisionists of so-called Austrian Marxism, abandoned the cause of the proletariat, and attempted to make Hungarian industrial workers and rural proletarians driven by the bourgeoisie, which was united with the big landlords. Although these traitors of the working class controlled the leadership of the Hungarian workers' movement for a relatively long period of time, they were unable to prevent the rapid spread of revolutionary Marxist ideas in the ranks of the proletariat, as evidenced by large-scale political and economic strikes, and even riots. The stormy strikes and demonstrations of 1910-1912, the several suppressed strikes of agricultural proletarians, and the large-scale political strike in Budapest in May 1912, which took the form of a proletarian uprising but was suppressed, are all worth recalling. The May 1912 strike demanded the cancellation of the war budget, demanded suffrage for workers, and raised other political demands that caused confusion within the bourgeoisie. The mass strikes organized during the First World War against the imperialist war are also memorable. Each of these strikes was suppressed by the reactionary warlords serving the bourgeoisie with bloody bayonets. The February Revolution and the Great October Socialist Revolution that broke out in Russia in 1917 gave great encouragement to the struggle of Hungarian workers. Particularly prominent in the struggle of Hungarian workers was the general strike in January 1918 against the world war. These strikes were all organized and led by Hungarian Marxist revolutionaries, namely the members of the soon-to-be-born Hungarian Communist Party. Despite all kinds of obstruction, slander, and intimidation by the traitorous Social Democratic leaders, workers and poor peasants had already begun to follow a new direction, the direction of socialist revolution, and they began to embark on a new road, the road pointed out by Lenin and the Russian Bolsheviks.
    After the end of the First World War, the Hungarian Communist Party was founded. What political organizations formed this party?
    The first part was the best members of several batches of Hungarian prisoners of war who returned from Russia. They had participated in the Great October Revolution and had been educated by the Bolshevik Party. The second part was the Hungarian group of revolutionary socialists. They carried out underground struggles against the imperialist war during the World War. The third part was the resolute revolutionaries in the left-wing Social Democratic organizations. Among these three components, there is no doubt that the most ideologically mature and with the richest revolutionary experience were the leaders who returned from Russia.
    The above three parties jointly made a resolution, advocating resolute opposition to the opportunists and revisionists rampant in the Hungarian workers' movement, announcing the organization of the Communist Party, establishing contact with the vanguard of the world proletarian revolution—the Russian Bolshevik Party, and put forward the current task, which is to firmly lead the broad masses of workers and poor peasants united around the Communist Party towards the socialist revolution under the banner of proletarian internationalism and victorious Marxism-Leninism.
    The Hungarian Communist Party was one of the founders of the Communist International formed under Lenin's guidance in the spring of 1919.
    The opportunist leaders of the Social Democratic Party shared the fruits of the post-war bourgeois revolution and participated in the government together with the bourgeoisie. Since they still played a decisive role in the policies of most industrial trade unions, they felt they were very powerful. They arrested the leaders of the Communist Party and opened fire on demonstrating workers and soldiers. They did not see that the bloody terror they caused only added fuel to the fire, and the ground under their feet had already become turbulent. The masses of workers became more and more firmly in support of the Communist Party's revolutionary policy.
    In March 1919, the Hungarian Communist Party victoriously led the proletarian revolution, which was a great test for it. This victory was of great international significance. The traitors of the workers' movement, together with the bourgeoisie, had loudly clamored that the October Socialist Revolution was a "special phenomenon of Russia". Lenin said that the establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic strongly refuted this deceptive propaganda. This victory proved that the proletarian revolution was not a "special phenomenon of Russia," but marked the inevitable final failure of imperialism, and the beginning of the dawn of socialism on a world scale, which the October Socialist Revolution had opened the way for. This is already an indisputable fact. Although the revolution to seize power was bloodless, the Western imperialists launched an attack on the Hungarian Soviet government with military force just one month after the Soviet government began to crush the old bourgeois state apparatus, organize a new revolutionary state system, and establish a social and political system that conformed to the interests of the working class and working peasants. Under the agitation and call of the Party, the heroic national liberation struggle against the imperialist army's attack on the Hungarian Soviet Republic began. Just as the Soviet Red Army was carrying out arduous struggles and glorious victories, the Hungarian Red Army completed its internationalist mission from April to August 1919, and created a series of military achievements, thereby writing its name in the history of the international proletarian revolutionary struggle. Unfortunately, under the historical conditions at that time, and under the offensive of the superior forces of imperialism and its running dogs, the Hungarian Soviet Republic failed to achieve complete victory.
    Although the Hungarian Soviet Republic existed for only one hundred and thirty-three days, the Party did not betray the people's hopes for it. The Hungarian proletariat and poor peasants will always cherish the Communist Party because it liberated the people from capitalist oppression. It organized and led the heroic war of liberation for four and a half months against Western imperialism and its running dogs. In this war, the Party achieved brilliant victories and experienced a lesson-rich failure. The establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and its lessons became a constantly functioning factor among hundreds of thousands of working masses. Without these lessons, it is difficult to imagine that under twenty-five years of cruel fascist dictatorship, not only did the capitalist and landlord system fail to destroy the Hungarian Communist Party, but, under the Horthy regime, the more rampant the fascist courts and executioners were, the more oppressed and exploited masses united under the glorious banner of the Communist Party.
    The second great historical test for the Hungarian communists' party was the crushing blow to the counter-revolution that launched an attack on the people's regime in 1956. In the autumn of 1956, the fascist counter-revolutionary remnants, the remnants of the bourgeoisie, the group of traitor Nagy Imre that had developed from revisionism to open counter-revolution, and the followers who had been driven mad by deceptive propaganda from this group, attacked the people's democratic state under the actual guidance of US imperialism. To aid these forces, American cargo planes and motorcades brought many fully armed fascists and a large amount of military equipment from the West across the opened borders. The purpose of US imperialism was very obvious. They wanted to subvert Hungary, thereby opening a gap in the socialist camp, weakening the unity of the socialist camp, and they wanted to achieve their vicious goals of division and war in this way. They made the plan, but the right of decision was still in the hands of the socialist camp, and as a result, they were badly bruised. The masses of Hungarian working people, workers, peasants, and progressive intellectuals, under the leadership of the Communist Party, launched a counter-offensive, and with the selfless assistance of the friendly Soviet Union and the political, moral, and material assistance of the People's Republic of China and all socialist countries, crushed the counter-revolution and consolidated the people's regime. Now the working people of Hungary are continuing to build socialism with their restored strength and with unprecedented enthusiasm, and are striving to realize communism. The party created by the Hungarian Communists forty years ago has also withstood this historical test and is even more wholeheartedly loved by the Hungarian people.
    American imperialism and their revisionist running dogs have also suffered a shameful defeat on the issue of the unity of the socialist camp. The Communist and Workers' Parties and the people of all countries have learned from the Hungarian counter-revolutionary conspiracy and the imperialist attacks against other socialist countries that our invincible strength lies in unity, in a firm internationalist policy, and in our unwavering loyalty to the cause of Marxism-Leninism. This great historical lesson has further consolidated the unity of socialist countries and greatly increased the strength of the socialist camp.
    Forty years of struggle have borne fruit. Our wishes and ideals have been realized. Marxism-Leninism is increasingly achieving great victories throughout the world. Our example—the great Soviet Union—has achieved victories of world-historical significance in the struggle against imperialism, giving imperialism a fatal blow. The great Chinese people have thoroughly defeated enemies armed to the teeth in the domestic revolutionary war and the war of liberation for decades. Now the whole world is praising the unprecedented achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction. The proletariat of another ten European and Asian countries has also triumphed, and these victories have introduced these countries to a happy socialist society with giant strides.
    The glorious national liberation struggles of the Eastern peoples have freed themselves from the rule of American and British imperialists in various parts of Asia, and the emotions, thoughts, and worldviews of hundreds of millions of people have changed. The awakening of infinite power and firm confidence in the future have replaced the original superstition and timidity. The invincible communist ideology is advancing victoriously on the ruins of capitalism. This is the evaluation of forty years. And the Hungarian communists are proud to be able to participate in this development that is changing the face of the world.
    The successor of the Hungarian Communists' Party, founded forty years ago—the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, is infinitely loyal to its glorious revolutionary tradition and holds high the banner of proletarian internationalism. It is a loyal and powerful supporter of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Party, relying on the Hungarian people and together with other fraternal socialist parties and workers' parties, is fighting for the victory of a prosperous communist society. (Attached pictures)

    匈牙利共产党成立四十年
    匈牙利驻华大使　诺格拉第·山道尔
    四十年前，1918年11月20日，匈牙利共产党成立了。它是从革命的匈牙利无产阶级的胸怀中产生的，是从匈牙利工人和贫苦农民几十年的英勇斗争中诞生的。当时社会主义革命已经在俄国胜利了，这个革命震动了全世界。列宁曾经宣称，在全世界，推翻资产阶级政权和无产阶级革命的胜利已经被提到历史的日程上来了。
    匈牙利革命的工人政党成立的前因，在某些主要特点上和其他几个欧洲共产党诞生的前因相类似。匈牙利工人的政治性组织工作是1868年开始的。匈牙利工人中最优秀的分子加入了马克思和恩格斯组织的第一国际，并且成为第一国际的一个组成部分。第一批社会主义的组织在1880年联合成为普通工人党，这个党于1890年采用了匈牙利社会民主党的名称，并且成为第二国际的成员。
    二十世纪初，在社会民主党内，左派开始了反对右派的斗争。这些右派分子采取了伯恩斯坦和所谓奥地利马克思主义的修正主义者的立场，放弃了无产阶级的事业，并企图使匈牙利产业工人和农民无产者受那些与大地主联合的资产阶级的驱使。虽然这些工人阶级的叛徒在比较长的时期内掌握了匈牙利工人运动的领导权，但他们没有能够阻止革命的马克思主义思想在无产阶级队伍中迅速传播，这表现在大规模的政治罢工和经济罢工、以至暴动上面。1910—1912年暴风雨般的罢工和示威、农业无产者几次被镇压了的罢工、1912年5月在布达佩斯采取无产阶级起义形式，但被镇压了的大规模政治罢工等，都是值得回忆的。1912年5月那次罢工要求取消战争预算，要求给工人以选举权，还提出了其他使资产阶级内部发生混乱的政治要求。第一次世界大战期间组织起来的反对帝国主义战争的群众罢工，也是值得纪念的。这些罢工每次都被为资产阶级服务的反动军阀用血腥的刺刀镇压下去了。1917年在俄国爆发的二月革命和伟大的十月社会主义革命，给匈牙利工人的斗争以巨大的鼓舞。在匈牙利工人的斗争中，特别突出的是1918年1月反对世界大战的总罢工。这些罢工都是由匈牙利马克思主义革命者，即是将诞生的匈牙利共产党党员所组织和领导的。尽管叛徒社会民主党领导人百般阻挠、污蔑和恐吓，但是工人和贫农已经开始追随新的方向，即社会主义革命的方向，他们开始走向新的道路，走向列宁和俄国布尔什维克所指出的道路。
    第一次世界大战结束后，匈牙利共产党成立了。这个党是由哪些政治组织成立的呢？
    第一部分是由俄国回来的几批匈牙利战俘中最优秀的分子。他们曾参加了伟大的十月革命，并且受到布尔什维克党的教育。第二部分是革命的社会主义者匈牙利小组。它们在世界大战期间进行了反对帝国主义战争的地下斗争。第三部分是左翼社会民主党人组织中的坚决革命者。在这三种成分中，毫无疑问，思想上最成熟并且具有丰富的革命经验的是从俄国回来的领导人。
    上述三方面的人共同作出决议，主张坚决反对在匈牙利工人运动中横行霸道的机会主义和修正主义者，宣布组织共产党，与无产阶级世界革命的先锋——俄国布尔什维克党取得联系，并且提出了当前的任务，这个任务就是在无产阶级国际主义和胜利的马克思列宁主义旗帜下，坚定地领导团结在共产党周围的广大工人和贫农群众走向社会主义革命。
    匈牙利共产党是1919年春天在列宁指导下组成的共产国际的创始者之一。
    社会民主党的机会主义领导人分享了战后资产阶级革命的果实，和资产阶级一起参加了政府。由于他们在大部分产业工会的政策上还起着决定性的影响，所以他们觉得自己很有力量，他们逮捕了共产党的领导人，向示威的工人和士兵开了火。他们没有看到他们造成的血腥恐怖只是火上加油，他们脚底下的土地已经动荡起来了，工人群众越来越坚定地拥护共产党的革命政策。
    1919年3月，匈牙利共产党胜利地领导了无产阶级革命，这是对它的一次极大的考验。这次胜利是具有重大国际意义的。工人运动的叛徒和资产阶级一道，曾经大声叫嚣说什么十月社会主义革命是“俄国的特殊现象”。列宁曾说，匈牙利苏维埃共和国的成立有力地驳斥了这种欺骗性的宣传。这个胜利证明了无产阶级革命不是“俄国的特殊现象”，而是标志着帝国主义最后必然失败，以十月社会主义革命开辟了道路的社会主义在世界范围内黎明的开端。这一点已经是无可争辩的事实。虽然夺取政权的革命没有流血，但刚过了一个月，苏维埃政府才开始粉碎旧的资产阶级国家机构，组织新的革命的国家制度，建立符合工人阶级和劳动农民利益的社会和政治制度，而西方帝国主义者就使用军事力量向匈牙利苏维埃政府发动了进攻。在党的鼓动和号召之下，反对帝国主义军队向匈牙利苏维埃共和国进攻的英勇的民族自由斗争开始了。就在苏联红军进行艰苦斗争和光荣胜利的时候，匈牙利红军自1919年4月至8月完成了它的国际主义任务，并且创造了一系列军事上的业绩，从而把自己的名字写在国际无产阶级革命斗争的历史上。可惜在当时的历史条件下，在帝国主义及其走狗的优势力量进攻下，匈牙利苏维埃共和国未能取得彻底胜利。
    虽然匈牙利苏维埃共和国仅仅存在了一百三十三天，党却没有辜负人民对它的希望。匈牙利无产阶级和贫农将永远爱戴共产党，因为它从资本主义的压迫下解放了人民。它组织并领导了为时四个半月的反对西方帝国主义及其走狗的英勇的自由战争。在这次战争中，党获得了很辉煌的胜利，而且经历了一次具有教训意义的失败。匈牙利苏维埃共和国的成立及其教训，在成千上万的劳动群众中成为经常起作用的因素。如果没有这些教训，那么，很难想像在二十五年残酷的法西斯专政下，资本家、地主的社会制度不仅未能摧毁匈牙利共产党，而且，在霍尔蒂制度下，法西斯法庭和刽子手越是猖狂，却有更多被压迫被剥削的群众团结在共产党光荣的旗帜之下。
    对于匈牙利共产主义者的党的第二次巨大的历史考验，就是1956年给予向人民政权发动进攻的反革命的粉碎性打击。1956年秋天，法西斯主义的反革命残余势力、资产阶级的残余、叛徒纳吉·伊姆雷的由修正主义发展到公开的反革命的集团和由这个集团用欺骗蛊惑宣传使之发了狂的信徒们，在美帝国主义实际指导下进攻了人民民主国家。为了援助这些势力，美国的运货飞机和汽车队在开放了的边境从西方带来很多全副武装的法西斯分子和大量军事装备。美帝国主义的目的很明显，他们想颠复匈牙利，从而在社会主义阵营打开一个缺口，削弱社会主义阵营的团结，他们想这样来达到他们狠毒的分裂和战争的目的。计划是他们制定的，但决定权还是掌握在社会主义阵营手中，结果他们碰得头破血流。匈牙利劳动人民群众，工人、农民和进步的知识分子在共产党的领导下发动了反攻，而且得到友好的苏联的无私援助和中华人民共和国以及所有社会主义国家在政治上、道义上和物质上的援助，粉碎了反革命，巩固了人民政权。现在匈牙利的劳动人民用他们恢复了的力量，用空前的热情在继续建设社会主义，为实现共产主义而奋斗。匈牙利共产党人在四十年前创建的党，也经受了这一次历史的考验，并且更加受到匈牙利人民衷心的爱戴。
    美国帝国主义和他们的修正主义走狗，在社会主义阵营团结问题上也遭受到了可耻的失败。共产党和工人党以及各国人民，从匈牙利反革命阴谋和帝国主义反对其他社会主义国家的进攻中吸取了这样的教训：我们不可战胜的力量在于团结，在于坚定的国际主义政策，在于我们对马列主义事业的不可动摇的忠诚。这个伟大的历史教训更加巩固了社会主义各国的团结，大大地增加了社会主义阵营的力量。
    四十年的斗争已结成了果实。我们的愿望和理想实现了。马克思列宁主义在全世界日益取得了巨大的胜利。我们的范例——伟大的苏联在与帝国主义斗争中获得了具有世界历史意义的胜利，给了帝国主义以致命的打击。伟大的中国人民几十年来在国内革命战争和解放战争中彻底打败了武装到牙齿的敌人。现在全世界都在赞扬中国人民在社会主义建设中获得的空前成就。另外十个欧洲和亚洲国家的无产阶级也胜利了，这些胜利用巨人的步伐把这些国家引入社会主义的幸福社会。
    东方人民光荣的民族解放斗争纷纷摆脱了美英帝国主义者在亚洲各地的统治，千百万人的感情、思想和世界观改变了。无限的力量的觉醒和对未来的坚定信心代替了原来的迷信和胆怯。无往不胜的共产主义思想踏着资本主义的废墟胜利前进。这就是四十年的评价。而匈牙利共产党人以自己能参加改变世界面貌的这个发展而感到自豪。
    四十年前成立的匈牙利共产主义者的党的继承者——匈牙利社会主义工人党，无限地忠于自己光荣的革命传统，高举着无产阶级国际主义旗帜。它是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结的忠诚而强有力的支持者。党依靠着匈牙利人民和其他兄弟的社会主义的党和工人党在一起，为了争取繁荣的共产主义社会的胜利而斗争。（附图片）
