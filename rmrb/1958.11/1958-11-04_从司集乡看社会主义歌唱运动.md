    Seeing the Socialist Singing Movement from Siji Township
    Ye Lin
    The Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Musicians Association recently held an on-site meeting in Siji Township, Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, to further promote the socialist singing movement. This meeting was convened in the context of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the great development of people's communes, the great popularization of culture, the vigorous development of mass literary and artistic creation, and the rise of new folk songs. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people's enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high, and they demand that all positive forces be mobilized to serve socialism. This objective situation determines that the socialist singing movement must be a nationwide socialist singing movement with workers, peasants, and soldiers as its main body. It must serve socialist politics and socialist production and construction. Therefore, it must be led by the Party committee, with politics in command, and integrated with the current struggle, production, and central tasks. In every revolutionary period in history, the mass singing movement has always been the bugle of the revolution, inspiring the revolutionary will of the working people. Today, we must inherit the revolutionary tradition of the mass singing movement and serve politics, production, and central tasks more closely, so that the movement can be carried out on a wider scale.
    There is an ideological struggle on this issue. The flood of yellow music in the early spring of last year was a concrete manifestation of this ideological struggle. Before the rectification campaign, some people emphasized the particularity of music and art, seriously divorced from politics, the masses, life, and tradition, one-sidedly pursuing form and large-scale works, unwilling to create mass songs or belittling mass songs. This is essentially a bourgeois idea of unwillingness to serve politics. After the rectification campaign, it should be said that the situation has undergone a fundamental change. The red flag of putting politics in command has been raised high, and new atmospheres have appeared everywhere. Musicians have gone deep into factories and rural areas, faced the masses, and made new leaps forward in creation, performance, and ideological style. The problem is that we need to continue to consolidate the achievements we have already made, unswervingly continue to implement the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and prevent any possible fatigue with the leap forward.
    Secondly, among our comrades, some in the past underestimated the combat role of art, simply understanding art as entertainment, and therefore believed that engaging in art would hinder production, so there was the saying "do it a lot during slack farming season, do it a little when a little busy, and don't do it when very busy." In some cases, there may be contradictions between production tasks and artistic activities. When production tasks are tight, necessary arrangements need to be made, and the form of artistic activities can also be flexibly changed. However, this formulation is easily understood as production and art being opposed, which affects the fundamental policy of art serving production during implementation. The experience of Siji Township in carrying out literary and artistic activities answers this question well. The township's literary and artistic activities flourished precisely during this year's tense struggle against drought. Anhui Province suffered an unprecedented hundred-day drought this year, and the peasants launched a earth-shattering struggle against the drought. They fought day and night, diverting the water of Chaohu Lake sixty miles to irrigate Huangshan. It was precisely during this tense production struggle that they achieved singing all over the fields, singing countless new folk songs full of revolutionary romanticism and optimism, such as: "Under the red flag, we show our heroic spirit, lifting up Chaohu Lake as a water ladle, not afraid of the sky not raining, wherever there is drought, we irrigate." "Thousands of dragons connect to the sky, the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl smile, now that the river water is used up, we will reunite before the seventh day of the seventh month," etc., were all sung during the fight against drought. Siji Township alone created 220,000 such folk songs during this period. Such facts eloquently show that serving politics, singing about production, and singing about central tasks not only will not reduce the quality of art, but will improve the quality of art. Only by closely combining with production struggle and political struggle can so many unprecedented new Book of Songs be produced. Such facts also show that production and literary and artistic activities are not opposed. The working people create culture and art in labor, and art in turn can promote production. Even when the production struggle is most tense, art—especially singing—can play the role of a battle horn, as a Anhui folk song says: "Don't look down on these everyday sayings, when spread in the fields, they turn into rice."
    The activities of Siji Township have also made us deeply realize that in order to carry out the socialist singing movement, we must rely on the masses, give full play to the creative spirit of the working people, and create a large number of new folk songs and new songs. Only in this way can the socialist singing movement be done more, faster, better, and more enduringly. This is true not only in terms of quantity, but also in terms of quality. China's 500 million peasants have the traditional habit of singing folk songs. They are accustomed to composing and singing their own songs in labor and life struggles, so-called "picking up the willow branches by looking at the wind," singing about whatever they see. Singing is not mysterious to them, and composing songs is not mysterious to them either. They have rich life experience, are directly engaged in production struggle and class struggle, and are familiar with excellent national and folk art forms. With the continuous improvement of socialist consciousness and the great development of socialist production, their spiritual outlook has also undergone significant changes, making their singing have new developments in content and form. It can be imagined how magnificent the momentum and scale of the socialist singing movement would be when 500 million peasants are fully mobilized, liberate their minds, master culture and art themselves, and sing to their heart's content. A recently popular folk song in Siji Township sings like this: "Men, women, old and young sing together, the more we sing the rice seedling song, the happier we are, we sing until the rooster crows busily, we sing until the little birds are late to return to their nests. We sing until the crops nod and smile, we sing until the fields are green, we sing until we work like tigers, we sing until the water flows up the hills." Isn't this fresh atmosphere of the socialist countryside composed and sung by the peasants themselves? The worker comrades have a revolutionary tradition of struggle, and have always been good at using literary and artistic weapons in revolutionary struggle to inspire themselves and attack the enemy. At the same time, they have also cultivated many outstanding amateur artistic talents, who often create excellent works. A large number of worker composers have already emerged. This year, on 'July 1', the Beijing Workers' Cultural Palace exhibited more than 200 excellent songs created by Beijing worker comrades during the Great Leap Forward. There are many such examples throughout the country. It must be emphasized that only by vigorously mobilizing the masses to create can the socialist singing movement be consolidated and developed.
    In the past, some regions engaged in the socialist singing movement were more accustomed to a top-down approach that relied solely on professional creation and guidance of the masses by a few professional workers, and less considered the issue of relying on the masses and liberating their creativity. Some comrades even rarely thought that the movement to compose and sing new folk songs would be an important part of the socialist singing movement. Some comrades said that the tunes of folk songs are monotonous and cannot reflect modern life, and it is doubtful whether they can be considered socialist songs. Some comrades simply said that there are no folk songs in their area. These doubts can only lead to the conclusion that the masses' methods are few and cannot last, and that folk songs will not develop. This is essentially a question of whether to believe in the masses, and it is also a question of line. If we don't follow the mass line, the result will be to bind the creativity of the masses, increase the mystery of music, make the working people afraid to do it themselves, and just wait for experts to teach them, making the movement cold and deserted, slow, poor, and wasteful; or the experts come and it is lively and bustling, but when the experts leave, it disappears like smoke, and even if a few backbones are cultivated, it cannot meet the needs. In order to give play to the enormous creativity of 600 million people, it is currently appropriate to advocate a movement of "learning folk songs, composing folk songs, and singing folk songs." This movement should become an important part of the socialist singing movement. Only in this way can the movement continue to surge forward.
    Emphasizing the mass line, with the literary and artistic ranks of the working people as the main force of our country's socialist literary and artistic ranks, does not mean belittling the role of professional workers. On the contrary, our Party has trained and continues to train a large number of professional literary and artistic workers who are both red and expert, becoming the backbone of the working class's literary and artistic ranks, and making important contributions to the creation of a new socialist national culture. From Nie Er and Xian Xinghai to today's vast professional composing ranks, their works often become the bugle of the times, singing the will and strength of the people, playing the role of mobilizing, inspiring, and educating the masses, and becoming the Party's powerful artistic weapon. It is wrong to ignore the role of professional teams, and it is also wrong to divide or oppose professional and amateur. Professional teams that are both red and expert, combined with the masses, can play a core and backbone role in the amateur teams, forming a whole, twisting into a rope, and generating enormous power. Of course, the work of professional workers also has a mass line problem and a self-transformation problem. We advocate the combination of professional literary and artistic groups and amateur literary and artistic groups, and professional literary and artistic workers not disengaging from physical labor, and closely combining with the working people and the literary and artistic activities of the working people. On the one hand, they learn from the masses, and on the other hand, they guide them. Experts can help the masses in theory, creative experience, and technology, while the national style, mass character, and vitality of mass art are often stronger than those of experts. Only by combining with each other and helping each other can the relationship between popularization and improvement be correctly resolved. Chairman Mao taught us: "We should respect specialists, and specialists are very precious to our cause. But we should tell them that all revolutionary writers and artists can only make their work meaningful by linking themselves with the masses, expressing the masses, and regarding themselves as loyal spokespersons of the masses. Only by representing the masses can we educate the masses, and only by being students of the masses can we be teachers of the masses." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume 3, page 865) Under the leadership of the Party, many professional workers have followed Chairman Mao's teachings and have made great achievements, especially after the rectification campaign. With the vigorous development of socialist construction, they have made great leaps forward in their work and ideological style, and new atmospheres have appeared everywhere. Professional workers need to continue to unswervingly implement the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, implement the mass line in their work, take the masses as teachers, and on this basis, create more excellent songs with national style that serve politics and production. The masses warmly welcome these songs, and these excellent songs are an important part of the socialist singing movement. In the future, we should vigorously do a good job in the publication and promotion of these excellent socialist songs.
    The socialist singing movement is currently the project in all music undertakings that is most closely combined with the masses. In order to better implement the mass line of music work, all musicians should invest in this movement in order to better connect with the masses, serve the masses, transform themselves, and promote the development of other music undertakings with the socialist singing movement as the center. At present, whether it is chorus, orchestra, national orchestra, solo, solo performance, or creation, there is the issue of how to better serve politics and production and how to better revolutionize and nationalize. The practice of the Yuejin Suona Ensemble in Xushui County, Hebei Province, has provided good experience in this regard. They have developed instrumental art through socialist revolutionary songs and powerfully played songs such as "Heroes Conquer the Dadu River." This is a good start. If all our musicians can devote themselves to the socialist singing movement, closely contact the masses, they can be inspired from it and drive all music undertakings to develop forward on a mass scale, so that 600 million people can be in high spirits and sing out the heroic era of our socialist construction.

    从司集乡看社会主义歌唱运动
    叶林
    文化部和中国音乐家协会前些时在安徽省巢县司集乡召开了一次进一步开展社会主义歌唱运动的现场会议。这次会议是在工农业生产大跃进、人民公社大发展、文化大普及、群众文艺创作蓬勃开展、新民歌风起云涌的情况下召开的。在党和毛主席的领导下，人民的生产热情无比高涨，并且要求调动一切积极力量为社会主义服务。这样的客观情况决定了社会主义歌唱运动必须是以工农兵劳动人民为主体的全民的社会主义歌唱运动，它必须为社会主义政治服务，为社会主义生产建设服务，因此，必须在党委领导下政治挂帅，与当前斗争、生产与中心工作相结合。在历史上的各个革命时期，群众歌唱运动从来都是革命的号角，鼓舞着劳动人民的革命意志，今天，我们必须继承群众歌唱运动的革命传统，更加紧密地为政治、为生产与中心工作服务，使运动能够在更广泛的规模上开展起来。
    在这个问题上，是存在着思想斗争的，像去年初春时黄色音乐一度泛滥，就是这种思想斗争的具体表现。整风以前，有些人强调音乐艺术的特殊性，严重脱离政治，脱离群众，脱离生活，脱离传统，片面追求形式和大部头的作品，不愿意创作群众歌曲或轻视群众歌曲，这实质上也是一种资产阶级的不愿意为政治服务的思想。整风以后，应该说，情况已经有了根本性的转变，政治挂帅的红旗高高举起，到处出现了新气象，音乐工作者深入工厂农村，面向群众，无论在创作、演出和思想作风上都有了新的跃进。问题是需要继续巩固已有的成绩，坚定不移地继续贯彻为工农兵服务的方针，防止可能出现的对跃进的一些倦怠情绪。
    其次，在我们的同志中间，过去也有些人对艺术的战斗作用估计不足，把艺术单纯理解为娱乐，因而认为搞艺术会妨碍生产，从而有过“农闲大搞，小忙小搞，大忙不搞”的说法。在某些情况下，生产任务和艺术活动可能是存在矛盾的，在生产任务紧张的时候，需要作必要的安排，艺术活动的方式也可以灵活变化。但是，这种提法容易被理解为生产与艺术是对立的，使艺术为生产服务这个根本性的方针在贯彻时受到影响。司集乡开展文艺活动的经验正好回答了这个问题。这个乡的文艺活动恰好是在今年抗旱的紧张斗争中蓬勃地开展起来的。安徽省今年遭遇了一场罕有的百日大旱，农民们展开了一场惊天动地的抗旱斗争。他们夜以继日地紧张战斗，把巢湖的水倒引了六十里，流上黄山。正好是在紧张的生产斗争中，他们做到了歌声遍野，唱出了无数充满着革命浪漫主义与乐观主义精神的新民歌，像：“大红旗下逞英豪，端起巢湖当水瓢，不怕老天不下雨，哪方干旱哪方浇。”“千条蛟龙接上天，牛郎织女笑开颜，如今车尽银河水，不等七七就团圆”等等，都是在抗旱斗争中唱出来的。单是司集乡在这期间就创作出了这样的民歌二十二万首。这样的事实雄辩地说明了为政治服务、唱生产、唱中心工作不仅不会降低艺术质量，反而会提高艺术质量，只有和生产斗争、政治斗争密切结合，才能产生出这许多前无古人的新诗经。这样的事实同时也说明了生产和文艺活动不是对立的，劳动人民在劳动中创造了文化艺术，而文艺反过来又能促进生产，即使是在生产斗争最紧张的时候，文艺——特别是歌唱，也能够发挥战斗号角的作用，正如一首安徽民歌所说那样：“别看都是口头语，撒到田里变米粮。”
    司集乡的活动，还使我们深刻地体会到开展社会主义歌唱运动必须依靠群众，充分发挥劳动人民的创造精神，大量创作新民歌、新歌曲。只有这样，社会主义歌唱运动才能够做到又多又快又好又长久。这不仅从数量、而且从质量上说也是如此。我国的五亿农民都有唱民歌的传统习惯，他们习惯于在劳动与生活斗争中自编自唱，所谓“望风采柳”，见啥唱啥。唱歌对他们并不神秘，编歌对他们也不神秘。他们生活经验丰富，直接从事生产斗争和阶级斗争，又熟悉民族和民间的优秀艺术形式，随着社会主义觉悟的不断提高与社会主义生产大发展，他们的精神风貌也起了显著的变化，使他们的歌唱从内容到形式都有了新的发展。可以设想，当五亿农民都充分地发动起来，解放了思想，自己掌握了文化艺术，纵情歌唱的时候，社会主义歌唱运动的声势规模该是多么壮阔。司集乡新近流行的一首民歌这样地唱道：“男女老少齐唱歌，秧歌越唱越快活，唱得公鸡忙报晓，唱得小鸟迟归窝。唱得庄稼点头笑，唱得遍野绿油油，唱得干活如猛虎，唱得水往岗上流。”这一片社会主义农村的清新气象，不就是农民们自己编唱出来的吗？工人同志有着革命的斗争传统，并且在革命斗争中一贯善于运用文艺武器来鼓舞自己，打击敌人。在斗争中同时也培养出了许多优秀的业余艺术人才，经常创作出优秀的作品。目前已经有大量的工人作曲者出现。今年‘七一’，北京市工人文化宫就曾经展览了北京工人同志在大跃进中创作的优秀歌曲二百多首。这些例子在全国各地都是很多的。必须强调大力发动群众创作，社会主义歌唱运动才能够巩固、发展。
    过去从事社会主义歌唱运动，有些地区比较习惯于一种单纯依靠专业创作、单纯依靠少数专业工作者向群众辅导的从上往下贯的方式，比较少考虑到依靠群众、解放群众创造力的问题。有些同志甚至很少想到编唱新民歌的运动竟然会是社会主义歌唱运动的一个重要组成部分。有些同志说民歌曲调单调不能反映现代生活，算不算社会主义歌曲，值得怀疑。有些同志干脆说他们那个地区没有民歌。这些怀疑只能使人得出这样的结论：群众的办法是不多的，也不能持久的，民歌是不会发展的。这实质上是一个是否相信群众的问题，也是一个路线问题。不走群众路线，结果便会束缚群众的创造力，增加音乐的神秘感，弄得劳动人民自己不敢动手，光等待专家来教导，使运动变成冷冷清清，少慢差费；或者是专家来了轰轰烈烈，专家走了烟消云散，即使培养了几个骨干，也不能满足需要。为了发挥六亿人民的巨大创造力，目前提倡一个“学民歌、编民歌、唱民歌”的运动是适宜的，这个运动应该成为社会主义歌唱运动的重要组成部分，只有这样，运动才能不断地高涨。
    强调群众路线，以劳动人民的文学艺术队伍为我们国家社会主义文学艺术队伍的主力军，并不等于轻视专业工作者的作用。相反地，我们党已经培养并且还在继续培养着大批又红又专的专业文艺工作者，成为工人阶级文艺队伍的骨干力量，为创作社会主义的民族的新文化作出重要贡献。从聂耳、星海直到今天的广大专业作曲队伍，他们的作品经常成为时代的号角，唱出了人民的意志和力量，发挥了动员群众、鼓舞群众、教育群众的作用，成为党的有力的艺术武器。忽视专业队伍的作用是错误的，把专业与业余分割或对立起来也是错误的。又红又专的专业队伍与群众结合，可以在业余的队伍当中起着核心作用和骨干作用，构成一个整体，拧成一股绳，发生巨大的力量。当然，专业工作者的工作也有一个群众路线的问题和自我改造的问题，我们提倡专业文艺团体和业余文艺团体结合，专业文艺工作者不脱离体力劳动，和劳动人民以及劳动人民的文艺活动紧密结合。一方面向群众学习，一方面辅导他们。专家们在理论上、创作经验和技术上可以帮助群众，而群众艺术的民族风格、群众性和生命力却往往比专家强，只有相互结合，相互帮助，普及与提高的关系才能够正确解决。毛主席教导我们说：“我们应该尊重专门家，专门家对于我们的事业是很可宝贵的。但是我们应该告诉他们说，一切革命的文学家艺术家只有联系群众，表现群众，把自己当作群众的忠实的代言人，他们的工作才有意义。只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。”（“毛泽东选集”第三卷865页）在党的领导下，不少的专业工作者们遵循着毛主席的教导，已经作出了很大的成绩，特别是在整风以后，随着社会主义建设事业的蓬勃开展，在工作上、思想作风上都有了很大的跃进，到处出现了新的气象。专业工作者们需要继续坚定不移地贯彻为工农兵服务的方针，贯彻工作上的群众路线，拜群众为老师，在这基础上，创作出更多具有民族风格，为政治、为生产服务的优秀歌曲。群众对这些歌曲是十分欢迎的，这些优秀歌曲是社会主义歌唱运动的重要组成部分。今后应该大力做好这些社会主义优秀歌曲的出版和推广工作。
    社会主义歌唱运动是目前一切音乐事业中和群众结合最密切的一个项目。为了更好地贯彻音乐工作的群众路线，一切音乐家们都应该投入这个运动中来，以便更好地联系群众、为群众服务，改造自己，并且以社会主义歌唱运动为中心，推动其它音乐事业的发展。目前，不论是合唱、管弦乐、民族管弦乐、独唱、独奏与创作事业，都存在着如何更好地为政治、为生产服务和如何更好地革命化、民族化的问题。河北徐水县跃进吹歌会的实践在这方面提供了良好的经验，他们通过社会主义革命歌曲来发展了器乐艺术，气势磅礴地吹奏出了“英雄战胜大渡河”等歌曲，这就是很好的开端。我们所有的音乐工作者如果都能投身到社会主义歌唱运动中来，密切和群众联系以后，是可以从中得到启发，带动一切音乐事业以群众性的规模向前发展，使六亿人民都能意气风发，歌唱出我们社会主义建设的英雄时代。
