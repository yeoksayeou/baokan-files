Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 1st: Soviet artificial satellite expert Fedorov said that the Soviet Union has now manufactured rockets of immense power, capable of launching very heavy artificial satellites to any altitude and placing them into orbit. He said that the massive satellites launched by the Soviet Union are an indicator of the high level of development of Soviet science, technology, and industry, and that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries will have more and higher indicators of this kind in the future.

He also said that the Soviet Union's launch vehicles and rocket control systems allow for the confident launching of various types of artificial satellites. In the future, various types of satellites will be launched according to the research tasks: those with longer or shorter lifespans, and those with orbits at high or low altitudes.

Speaking of the main problems that Soviet scientists are continuing to work on, Fedorov said that a very important issue is to develop a method for returning satellites to the ground. This problem may be solved in two ways: one way is to use jet propulsion for braking, and the other is to use air for braking.

    苏联已制成力量巨大的火箭
    能把很重卫星射到任何高度
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　苏联人造卫星专家费多罗夫说，现在苏联已经制成了力量巨大的火箭，能够把很重的人造卫星发射到任何高度，使之进入轨道。他说，苏联发射的巨大卫星是苏联科学技术和工业高度发展的指标，今后苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的这种指标还会更多、更高。
    他还说，苏联拥有的运载火箭和火箭控制系统容许有把握地发射各种类型的人造卫星。今后将根据研究的任务，发射各种类型的卫星：存在时期较长或较短的，轨道在高空或轨道在低空的。
    谈到苏联科学家正在继续努力解决的主要问题，费多罗夫说，一个非常重要的问题就是制订出使卫星回到地面上来的方法。这个问题可能通过两条道路来解决；一条道路就是用喷射推进机来制动，另一条道路就是利用空气来制动。
