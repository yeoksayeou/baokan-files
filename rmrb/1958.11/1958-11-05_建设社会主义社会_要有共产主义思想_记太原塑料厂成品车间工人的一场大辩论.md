Building a Socialist Society Requires Communist Thought
    ——A Record of a Great Debate Among Workers in the Finished Products Workshop of the Taiyuan Plastics Factory
    Zhang Minzhi, Cui Chengshan
    In the great leap forward in production, the vast majority of workers in the finished products workshop of the Taiyuan Plastics Factory consciously and voluntarily worked overtime day and night, and production increased several times or even dozens of times. They did not want more compensation. They understood that today's labor is not for personal wealth, but to build a socialist society ahead of schedule and transition to a communist society as soon as possible.

    Some People Still Have Confused Ideas, Regarding Material Incentives as Motivation
    However, some people are not like this. Influenced by bourgeois legal rights thinking, they believe that more pay for more work is the most ideal distribution principle, and material incentives are most conducive to developing production. Otherwise, people will have no motivation to work and labor. Some people proposed that it is unreasonable not to pay for overtime and hard work. Li Yugou said: "The socialist distribution principle is to each according to his work. It is unreasonable not to pay wages for overtime and hard work." Ma Baobao said: "It is most reasonable to pay as much money as you do. Because more work consumes more energy, it is necessary to give more compensation." Tian Fa said: "More work for more pay is the most stimulating to people's enthusiasm. More work for no more pay is to打击 (dǎjī - crack down) the workers' initiative."

    Remuneration According to Work Cannot Be Considered Entirely Reasonable. Material Incentives Can Only Stimulate Individualism
    However, the vast majority of workers disagreed with this view. They believed that the principle of distribution according to work should be treated with communist thought. Thus, a great debate unfolded. Guo Sibao said: "It is true that the socialist distribution principle is to each according to his work. Because there are not many material products in socialist society, and people's consciousness is not high. But we must also see its negative aspects. In our factory, there is a comrade, a family of three, with a monthly salary of more than 200 yuan, and saves more than 100 yuan in the bank every month. But Zhang Mingshan, a family of seven, with a monthly salary of 45 yuan, has more difficult family life. Can this be said to be the most reasonable?" Guo Erchou said: "We must treat the principle of distribution according to work with communist thought, and not with individualistic thought. Working to earn more wages and working to get more bonuses will breed bourgeois individualistic thinking that is all for oneself."

    To Climb the Mountain of Socialism, One Must Sing the Song of Communism
    Despite everyone's painstaking efforts to present many facts and explain many principles, some people's thinking was still not clear. Li Yugou said: "We are now in a socialist society, not yet in a communist society. Say what is appropriate for the society you are in. Sing the song that's appropriate for the mountain you are standing on." Everyone analyzed and studied this argument and launched a debate. They unanimously agreed that it is very dangerous to only look at the present and not at the future, to only know socialism and not communism. Guo Erchou said: "Our working class should look further ahead. For example, when playing chess, when you take a step, you should see the next step. Otherwise, you may lose. It is the same with walking. When you take a step, you should see the next step. Otherwise, you may fall. Social development is even more so. In the period of the New Democratic Revolution, we should see socialism. In a socialist society, we should see communism. If we can't see it, we can't move forward."

    Although this argument was agreed to by many people, those with individualistic ideas were still making small calculations for personal enjoyment. At the meeting, Tian Fa stood up and said: "A happy communist life is good, but now we are working overtime, working hard day and night, so tense. What happiness is there if we die?" In response to this argument, everyone scrambled to express their opinions and launched a heated debate. Zhang Niucheng said: "Humans are different from ordinary animals. We cannot only care about today and not about tomorrow. If we were like 'croaking roosters and cooing hens, eating at night and not worrying about getting up early', how could we build socialism? And how could we transition to communism?" Guo Erchou also said: "We cannot live the two-bit (èrlizi - good for nothing) life of 'drink today and worry about tomorrow'. The hard work of the present few years is for the happiness of ten thousand years in the future. If you die, your children and grandchildren will still enjoy it. It is not okay to ignore children and grandchildren. We should benefit the next generation."

    Through the debate, all the workers improved their communist consciousness. During the national high-yield week of steel production, everyone worked overtime and struggled hard to strive for high yields and meritorious service. Even those who used to haggle over remuneration according to work no longer considered the amount of personal remuneration.

    建设社会主义社会　要有共产主义思想
    ——记太原塑料厂成品车间工人的一场大辩论
    张民植　崔成善
    在生产大跃进中，太原塑料厂成品车间的绝大部分职工，自觉自愿地加班加点，昼夜苦战，生产几倍几十倍地提高着。他们并不要更多的报酬。他们懂得，今天的劳动不是为了个人发财致富，而是为了提前建成社会主义社会，早日过渡到共产主义社会。
    一些人还有糊涂观念把物质刺激看成动力
    但是，也有一些人不是这样的。他们受着资产阶级法权思想的影响，认为多劳多得是最理想的分配原则，物质刺激最有利于发展生产。否则，人们工作、劳动就没有了动力。有人提出加班苦战不给钱不合理。李玉苟说：“社会主义分配原则是按劳取酬。加班苦战不给工资不合理。”马保宝说：“干多少活，给多少钱最合理。因为多干活，消耗人的精力大，就需要多给些报酬来补偿。”田发说：“多劳多得最刺激人们的干劲。多劳不多得，就是打击工人的积极性”。
    按劳取酬不能认为十分合理物质  刺激只能刺激个人主义
    可是绝大部分职工不同意这种看法。他们认为应当用共产主义思想来对待按劳取酬的原则。于是一场大辩论就展开了。郭四宝说：“不错，社会主义的分配原则是按劳取酬。因为社会主义社会物质产品还不多，人们的觉悟还不高。但是也要看到它的消极方面。我们厂里有一位同志，全家三口人，每月工资二百多元，每月存银行一百多元。可是张明善，全家七口人，每月工资四十五元，家庭生活就比较困难。这能说最合理吗？”郭二丑说：“我们要用共产主义思想来对待按劳取酬的原则，不能用个人主义思想来对待。为了多赚工资而劳动，为了多得奖金而工作，就会滋长一切为个人的资产阶级个人主义思想。”
    登上社会主义的山要唱共产主义的歌
    尽管大家苦口婆心地摆了许多事实，讲了许多道理，但是有些人思想还是不通。李玉苟说：“我们现在是社会主义社会，还没有到共产主义社会。到什么社会，说什么社会的话。站在什么山上，唱什么歌”。大家针对这个论点，进行了分析研究，展开了辩论。一致认为只看眼前，不看将来，只知社会主义，不知共产主义，是很危险的。郭二丑说：“我们工人阶级应当看得远一些。比如下象棋，走上一步，就应该看到下一步。不然，就可能输掉，走路也是一样，走上一步，就应当看到下一步。不然就可能跌交。社会的发展更是这样，在新民主主义革命时期，就应当看到社会主义，在社会主义社会，就应当看到共产主义。如果看不到，就不能前进。
    这一论点虽然为许多人所同意，但是有个人主义思想的人，仍然为个人享受而打小算盘。会上，田发站起来说：“共产主义的幸福生活好是好，可是现在加班加点，昼夜苦战，这么紧张，要是死了还有什么幸福可谈呢？”针对这一论点，大家争先恐后发表意见，展开热烈争辩。张牛成说：“人和普通动物不一样，不能只顾今天，不管明天。要像‘呱呱公鸡，咕咕母鸡，吃了晚上不管早起’一样，我们怎么能建成社会主义？又怎么能过渡到共产主义？”郭二丑也说：“我们不能过‘今朝有酒今朝醉’的二流子生活。现在的几年辛苦，是为了将来的万年幸福。你死了，还有儿孙后代享受。不管儿孙后代是不行的。我们应当为下一代造福。”
    经过辩论，全体职工提高了共产主义觉悟。在全国钢铁生产高产周里，大家加班苦战，争取高产立功，连那些斤斤计较按劳取酬的人也不再考虑个人报酬多少的问题了。
