Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Taipei dispatch: The US Marines who arrived in Taiwan in early September under the pretext of participating in exercises are still stationed around Tainan. Yesterday, Colonel Van Omen, the head of this invading US ground force, clamored that they would "maintain a state of combat readiness for a long time" in Taiwan in order to "sanction the enemy." US "Ambassador" to Taiwan, Drumright, also told these US officers and soldiers at a rally of this invading US military unit yesterday, "Keep your swords sharp - you may have to use them one day." US invading troops commander Smoot said he "is willing to repeat" what the "Ambassador" said.

Reports say that the continued entrenchment of approximately four thousand US ground troops in Taiwan has caused dissatisfaction and unease in Taiwan. Many Taiwanese military and government personnel believe that sending these mere thousands of US Marines for "amphibious landings" on the mainland is of course a joke. What is worth considering is that they may become a hidden danger beside Taiwan's bed.

The US "Military Aid Program Investigation Team" arrived in Taipei from Japan on the 9th. The head of this investigation team, Shaffer, said that their arrival in Taiwan "is to study how this aid is being used and to ensure that it is being used appropriately." This investigation team is conducting "investigations" of various Chiang Kai-shek military units.

    美国在台湾的官员公然叫嚣
    侵台美军要拔剑张弩
    新华社11日讯  台北消息：在9月初以参加演习为名开到台湾的美国海军陆战队，目前仍然驻扎在台南一带。昨天，这支侵台美军地面部队的负责人范奥门上校叫嚣说，他们在台湾“将长期保持战斗准备状态”，以便“制裁敌人”。美国驻台湾“大使”德鲁姆赖特昨天也在这支侵台美军部队的集会上，向这些美军官兵说，“使你们的宝剑保持锐利——你们可能会有一天不得不使用它们。”侵台美军司令斯摩特说，他“愿意重复”这个“大使”所说的这句话。
    有消息说，约四千名美国地面部队在台湾继续盘踞下去，已经在台湾引起不满和不安。台湾许多军政人员认为，把这区区几千名美国海军陆战队派作向大陆进行“两栖登陆”的用场，当然是笑话。值得考虑的倒是他们可能成为台湾卧榻之旁的心腹之患。
    美国“军援计划考察团”9日由日本到台北。这个考察团的负责人夏夫说，他们到台湾“是要研究这种援助是怎样使用的，同时要确保这种援助得到适当的使用”。这个考察团正对蒋军各单位进行“调查”。
