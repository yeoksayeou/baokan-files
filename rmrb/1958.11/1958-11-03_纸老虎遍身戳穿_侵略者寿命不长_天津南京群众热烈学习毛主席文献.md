Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 2nd: Chairman Mao's important document, "Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers," has been warmly embraced by the people of Tianjin.

    Workers from the Tianjin Vehicle Accessories Factory, who had participated in the "February 7th" strike, fought against Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, held a discussion after reading Chairman Mao's writings. Old fitter Huo Kui, who participated in the "February 7th" strike, recalled the scene of railway workers uniting to fight against the reactionaries and winning victory. He said that the strength of the people is greater than that of imperialism and reactionaries. When the broad masses of people are awakened, imperialism and reactionaries cannot stand. The victory of the Chinese revolution is a most vivid proof. Liu Fu, a model worker from the foundry workshop, said that the principle of "a single spark can start a prairie fire" as said by Chairman Mao is equally applicable during the period of construction. When we were first liberated, we did not have many factories and production was very low. Some people envied US imperialism, saying it was good in this way and that. But in a few years, our industry developed. Many of the machines we make ourselves have surpassed or caught up with the quality level of products from imperialist countries. This year, the people of the whole country have made a great leap forward, and the speed of development is even faster, while the situation in imperialist countries is the opposite, simply a setting sun.

    Old workers from the Renli Woolen Textile Factory's philosophy self-study group held a discussion. They said that Chairman Mao's assertion that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" fully demonstrates the brilliance and greatness of Chairman Mao's philosophical thought. Old worker Li Changmao said: The various weak and small nations of the world will never be willing to be subjected to imperialist aggression and oppression for a long time, and they are bound to rise up to resist. This struggle is just and is supported by peace-loving people all over the world. But the imperialists violate the laws of historical development and do not recognize objective existence, so they are banging their heads everywhere.

    Some students in the third grade of the History Department of Nankai University held a discussion today. Everyone felt particularly cordial and profound after reviewing Chairman Mao's remarks. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the eighteen students in this class formed a "US Imperialist Aggression Against China History Writing Group" in September to expose the false face of US imperialism and expose the truth about the paper tiger with historical facts. The two popular pamphlets they wrote, "A Short History of US Imperialist Aggression Against China" and "The Paper Tiger Revealed," are about to be published. Zhang Ruilian, Lü Yanding, Xia Jiajun, Zhang Xiaoping, Liu Dewei, and others, the authors of "The Paper Tiger Revealed," all talked about how the process of writing was also a process of deeply understanding the truth that Chairman Mao said, "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." Xia Jiajun said: Writing "The Paper Tiger Revealed" has made me more deeply aware of the essence of the American paper tiger, and also strengthened my confidence in liberating Taiwan. Chairman Mao said well: "The life of imperialism will not be very long, because they do nothing but bad things."

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 2nd: After Chairman Mao's important document on "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" was published in Nanjing newspapers, the broad masses of troops, organs, factories, communes, schools, and even steel bases, launched enthusiastic study and discussions. Zhu Qingyun, director of the professorial meeting of a military school, said excitedly after studying: For decades, Chairman Mao's brilliant assertion has taken root in our hearts. We have competed with Japanese robbers, Chiang Kai-shek, and American devils. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's military thought, from the era of millet plus rifles, we have never taken imperialism and reactionaries seriously in strategy, despising them, but valuing the enemy in every specific struggle. Imperialism and all reactionaries seem fierce on the surface, but they are all outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Not to mention the Japanese devils and Chiang Kai-shek, even the leader of imperialism, the American robbers, although they once boasted about "air superiority and artillery superiority" on the Korean battlefield, when we actually confronted them, the true nature of the paper tiger was exposed. That look of fear, panic, and surrender is still ridiculous to think about. Since the founding of the army, we have moved from victory to victory under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. Today, reviewing these true maxims of Chairman Mao, we feel particularly cordial and have a deeper understanding. As long as we hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, we will be invincible.

    Cao Jinquan, secretary of the Party branch of the First Brigade of the Yuhuatai People's Commune, pointed to the tomb of revolutionary martyrs in Yuhuatai after studying and said: In the twenty-two years of Kuomintang reactionary rule starting in 1927, 100,000 revolutionary martyrs heroically sacrificed themselves here. He personally saw the executioners – Japanese imperialism, traitor Wang Jingwei, and Kuomintang reactionaries – killing people here, rampant to the point where they wouldn't even let people look up when walking. However, the more suppressed the people's strength became, the stronger it became. Cao Jinquan said that once he personally saw seven revolutionary youths in their twenties shouting slogans "Down with imperialism," "Imperialism must perish," and "Long live the Communist Party" before their deaths. These slogans have all come true today.

    Wang Changhuai, a steel worker at the Nanjing Baixia United Steel Plant, said: In the past, Japanese imperialism relied on a few more tons of steel than us to invade our country, but later they were defeated by us. Now US imperialism has not learned the lessons of its defeat on the Korean battlefield and is conducting military threats in the Taiwan Strait. We are now stepping up steel production and accelerating socialist construction. If it really dares to impose war on the Chinese people, we will definitely give this paper tiger – US imperialism, which was exposed on the Korean battlefield – a devastating blow.

### 纸老虎遍身戳穿  侵略者寿命不长  天津南京群众热烈学习毛主席文献

    纸老虎遍身戳穿
    侵略者寿命不长
    天津南京群众热烈学习毛主席文献
    据新华社天津2日电　“毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的重要文献，受到天津人民的热烈拥护。
    天津车辆附件厂曾经参加“二七”斗争和对日本帝国主义、国民党反动派进行过斗争以及参加过抗美援朝的工人们读了毛主席的论著以后，举行了漫谈。曾参加“二七”斗争的老钳工霍奎回忆了当年铁路工人团结一致向反动派斗争获得胜利的情景以后说，人民的力量比帝国主义和反动派的力量更大，广大人民群众觉悟了，帝国主义和反动派就站不住脚。中国革命的胜利就是一个最生动的证明。翻砂车间模型工刘福用说，毛主席说的“星星之火，可以燎原”的道理，在建设时期也同样适用。刚解放的时候，我们没有多少工厂，生产很低，有些人羡慕美帝国主义，说它这个好，那个好。可是几年工夫，我们工业就发展起来。我们自己制造的机器好多种都超过或赶上了帝国主义国家产品的质量水平。今年全国人民大跃进，发展速度更快，而帝国主义国家的情况恰恰相反，简直是日落西山了。
    仁立毛呢纺织厂哲学自学小组的老工人们举行了座谈。他们说毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论断，充分说明毛主席哲学思想的英明和伟大。老工人李长茂说：世界上各个弱小民族是决不甘心长期受帝国主义侵略和压迫的，他们必然要起来反抗，这是客观存在。这种斗争是正义的，得到世界上爱好和平人民的支持。但是帝国主义者违反历史发展规律，不承认客观存在，所以到处碰得头破血流。
    南开大学历史系三年级的一些学生，今天举行了座谈会，大家重温毛主席的谈话以后感到特别亲切深刻。这个班的十八个学生今年9月份在党支部的领导下，组成了
  “美帝侵华史编写小组”，用历史事实揭破美帝国主义的假面貌，戳穿纸老虎的真相。他们写的“美帝侵华小史”和“纸老虎现形记”两本通俗的小册子即将出版。“纸老虎现形记”的作者张瑞莲、吕延鼎、夏家骏、张小平、刘德炜等人都谈到，他们写作的过程，也是对毛主席所说的“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”这个真理深刻体会的过程。夏家骏说：编写了“纸老虎现形记”，使我更加深刻地认识了美国纸老虎的本质，而且更加增强了解放台湾的信心。毛主席说得好：“帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了，因为它们尽做坏事”。
    据新华社南京2日电　毛主席论“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的重要文献在南京报纸刊出后，部队、机关、工厂、公社、学校以至钢铁基地的广大群众，都展开了热烈学习和讨论。某军事学校教授会主任朱卿云，在学习后兴奋地说：几十年来，毛主席这一英明论断，已经在我们心坎上扎根了。日本强盗、蒋介石、美国鬼子，我们都曾较量过。在毛主席的军事思想指导下，从小米加步枪的时代起，在战略上我们从不把帝国主义和反动派放在话下，藐视它们，而在每一个具体斗争中间却重视敌人。帝国主义和一切反动派表面上气势凶凶，但都是外强中干。日本鬼子和蒋介石不必说了，就是帝国主义头子美国强盗，在朝鲜战场上虽曾大肆吹嘘“空中优势和大炮优势”，可是当我们真正交手，纸老虎的本相就暴露无遗了。那种恐惧、慌乱和举手投降的狼狈相，现在想起来还很可笑。建军以来，我们在毛主席的英明领导下，从胜利走向胜利。今天，重温毛主席的这些真理名言，感到格外亲切，体会也越加深刻。只要我们高举毛主席的思想红旗，就能无往而不胜利。
    雨花台人民公社第一大队党支部书记曹金全在学习后手指着雨花台人民革命烈士墓说：从1927年开始国民党反动派统治的二十二年中，有十万革命先烈英雄牺牲在这里。他曾亲眼看到刽子手——日本帝国主义、卖国贼汪精卫、国民党反动派在这里杀人，猖獗得连走路也不让人抬头。但是，越镇压人民力量越强。曹金全说有一次他亲眼看到七个二十多岁的革命青年在临死前都高呼：“打倒帝国主义”、“帝国主义一定要灭亡”、“共产党万岁”的口号。这些口号今天都应验了。
    南京白下联合钢铁厂钢铁工人王长怀说：过去日本帝国主义凭着比我们多几吨钢侵略我国，可是后来却被我们打败了。现在美帝国主义还没有记取朝鲜战场上失败的教训，又在台湾海峡进行军事威胁，我们现在加紧钢铁生产，加速社会主义建设，如果它真的敢于把战争强加在中国人民头上，我们就一定给这个在朝鲜战场上被戳穿了的纸老虎——美帝国主义以毁灭性打击。
