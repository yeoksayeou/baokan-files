    Sweet Potato Cooked in a Hundred Ways: Commune Members Praise It

    The dining hall of the Luma Brigade of the Suqiao People's Commune in Xuchang County, Henan Province, has always been run very well. The commune members' usual meals are: three steamed buns a day, sweet and salty soups to drink as much as they want, delicious dishes for every meal, and improved living standards every ten days. The cooks in the dining hall try every means to make everyone satisfied with their meals. For example, this year there was an unprecedented bumper harvest of sweet potatoes. The cooks used their brains to find ways to use sweet potatoes to trial-produce 115 different types of pastries and meals to adjust the taste of the commune members. In terms of meals, there are white steamed buns, four-joy meatballs, diced braised pork, vegetable buns, dumplings, etc.; pastries include eight-treasure cakes, first-class cakes, and kidney bean corners... These foods do not taste like sweet potatoes at all. Old lady Zhao Zhu said: "I am seventy-three years old this year, and I have never seen sweet potatoes that can be made into a hundred kinds of food." Not only are the poor and lower-middle peasants satisfied, but even the well-to-do middle peasant Lu Dexian, who once said "things are not as good as before," also admits that the food in the dining hall exceeds his original living standards.

    The commune members composed a clapper rhyme to praise: The collective dining hall is really good, saving food and spending less money, there are many varieties of food, and the living standards are greatly improved. There are more labor attendance days, and we get up early to work in the fields. The work efficiency is fast and the quality is high, and we can rely on it for a bumper harvest next year.

    甘薯做成百样饭  社员吃了齐称赞
    河南许昌县苏桥人民公社禄马大队的食堂一直办得很好。社员们平常的饭菜是：一天三顿馍，甜汤咸汤尽量喝，顿顿有可口菜，十天改善一次生活。食堂的炊事员们想尽一切办法，使大家吃得满意。比如今年红薯空前丰收，炊事员们开动脑筋想办法，用红薯试制出一百一十五样不同类型的糕点和饭食，调剂社员的口味。在饭食方面有白餎馍、四喜丸子、方肉、菜包、饺子等；糕点有八宝酥、一品饼、梅豆角……。这些食品一点也吃不出红薯味道。赵柱老大娘说：“我今年七十三，没见红薯能做百样饭。”不仅中贫农社员满意，就连曾经说过“今不如昔”的富裕中农禄德贤，也承认食堂的伙食超过了他原来的生活水平。
    社员们编了一首快板歌颂道：集体食堂真正好，节约粮食花钱少，饭食花样多，生活改善的好。劳力出勤多，下地起得早，工效快、质量高，明年丰收有了靠。　黄中海　杨国勋
