Breaking Down Old Systems, Unleashing Limitless Potential
Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Rolling Mill Workers Vow to Produce One Million Tons of Steel in the Fourth Quarter

(By Our Newspaper) Anshan Iron and Steel Works' rolling mills' employees have launched a massive mass movement, resolutely guaranteeing the production of one million tons of steel in the fourth quarter to support industrial construction across the country.

The one million tons of steel that various rolling mills in Anshan Iron and Steel Works will produce in the fourth quarter to support the whole nation are all urgently needed for industrial construction in various provinces. Among them are steel materials for the construction of mines by the coal industry sector, and double-track steel rails for the Beijing-Guangzhou and Tianjin-Pukou railways currently under construction, and so on. In order to resolutely complete this task, various rolling mills in Anshan Iron and Steel Works have deeply mobilized the masses, launched a great airing of views, great debates, thoroughly broken down outdated rules and regulations and conservative thinking, and established revolutionary rules and regulations and a daring Communist style, thus greatly liberating the productive forces. The workers of the west span of the large shearing machine in the second workshop of the small factory, once constrained by the old cutting system, suffered from low output and poor quality. Now, after engaging in a great technical revolution and a great production doubling movement, they have broken down the superstition of the old cutting system, changing from the original cutting system of cutting one edge from a piece of raw material and then cutting again to become two pieces of raw material, to a cutting system of not cutting the edge but only cutting once to become two pieces of raw material, so that the shift output of cutting materials jumped from 1,800 pieces to 3,500 pieces. The Party committee of the large rolling mill, which produces steel for railway construction, held several enlarged meetings to criticize conservative thinking, and launched a mass airing of views and debate among all employees, abolishing 59 unreasonable outdated rules and regulations, which greatly improved production efficiency. During the high-yield week from October 25th to 31st, workers of the C shift rolled 114 steel rails per hour, breaking through the barrier of 110 rails per hour. The workers of the B shift continued to forge ahead, increasing the hourly output of heavy rails to 115. In October, the plant increased the daily output of rolled heavy rails from 3,811 tons in the past to 4,214 tons. After the workers, cadres, and technicians of the first primary rolling mill launched a discussion on the issue of abolishing outdated rules, a new atmosphere also emerged. On November 4th, the tonnage rolled increased from an average of 6,500 tons in the past to 7,800 tons, laying a good foundation for the plant to complete its production tasks for the fourth quarter.

In this battle, the employees of various rolling mills demonstrated the spirit of Communist large-scale cooperation. In order to allow the primary rolling mill to roll out more steel for various rolling mills to produce, various brother factories put forward the slogan of "fully supporting the primary rolling mill." Large rolling mills and seamless steel pipe plants and other units sent a large number of bricklayers to the primary rolling mill to build soaking pits, so that it could be put into steel rolling production as soon as possible.

### 冲破陈旧制度　解放无穷潜力  鞍钢轧钢工人立志第四季度生产钢材百万吨

    冲破陈旧制度　解放无穷潜力
    鞍钢轧钢工人立志第四季度生产钢材百万吨
    本报讯　鞍钢各轧钢厂职工掀起一个声势浩大的群众运动，坚决保证在第四季度内拿出一百万吨钢材，支援全国各地的工业建设。
    各轧钢厂第四季度生产支援全国各地的一百万吨钢材，全是各省工业建设所迫切需要的。其中有煤炭工业部门建设矿井用的钢材，有目前正在建设的京广和津浦两条铁路用的复线钢轨等等。为了坚决完成这一任务，鞍钢各轧钢厂深入发动群众，大鸣大放，大争大辩，大破陈规旧制和保守思想，大立革命性的规章制度和敢想敢干的共产主义风格，因而大大解放了生产力。小型厂第二车间西跨度大剪断机的职工，曾因为受到旧切料制度的束缚，不但切料的产量低，质量也不好。现在，他们在大闹技术革命、大闹生产翻番运动以后，破除了对旧切料制度的迷信，由原来一片原料切去一个边，再切一刀才成为二片原料的切料制度，改为不切边只切一刀就可以成为二片原料的切料制度，使切料的班产量由一千八百片跃进到三千五百片。生产支援铁路建设钢材的大型轧钢厂，党委召开了多次扩大会议，批判了保守思想，并在全厂职工展开鸣放辩论，废除了不合理的陈规旧律五十九项，大大的提高了生产效率。这个厂在10月25日到31日的高产周中，丙班工人一小时轧出一百一十四根钢轨，突破了小时产量一百一十根的大关，乙班工人又乘风破浪前进，使重轨小时产量提高到一百一十五根。10月份，这个厂把日轧制重轨的产量由过去的三千八百一十一吨提高到四千二百一十四吨，第一初轧厂的工人、干部、技术人员，就废除陈规的问题展开讨论以后，也出现了新气象。在11月4日这一天，轧制吨数从过去的平均六千五百吨提高到七千八百吨，给这个厂完成第四季度生产任务打下良好基础。
    各轧钢厂的职工，在这一场战斗中，都表现了共产主义大协作的精神。为让初轧厂轧出更多的钢材，供应给各轧钢厂生产，各兄弟厂提出了“全力支援初轧厂”的大协作口号。大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂等单位把大批瓦工派到初轧厂建设均热炉，好使它能早日投入轧钢生产。
