The Correct Path for Scientific Research in Universities
Experiences of Tsinghua University in Implementing the Comprehensive Integration of Production, Teaching, and Scientific Research
Gao Jingde

In the past six months, Tsinghua University has continuously advanced its work in implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, with one high tide following another, each surpassing the previous one, achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest in production, teaching, and scientific research. Regarding scientific research and new product trial manufacturing alone, according to recent statistics, our university has completed 844 major projects in the past six months, 130 of which have reached advanced international levels, and 522 have reached advanced domestic levels. Some projects are of great significance to the national economy and are of a high standard. Furthermore, 380 types of products have been produced, 262 design and engineering tasks have been completed for other units, equivalent to approximately 150,000 workdays, and 94 types of teaching outlines, technical materials, textbooks, etc., have been compiled, along with 416 teaching plans, teaching outlines, and labor plans. The achievements of our university in production, teaching, and scientific research in the past six months are significant, not only greatly exceeding previous years in terms of quantity, quality, speed, and scale, but more importantly, fundamentally transforming the direction and methods of our university's teaching and scientific research from practical work, laying a solid foundation for our university's second education revolution and the march towards science and technology. This is the victory of the Party's education policy, and the victory of the Party's leadership in scientific research.

Theory Linking Practice and Giving Play to Collective Strength are the Guiding Principles for Advancing Towards Science

On this issue, we have had many debates with bourgeois intellectuals, especially the great debate on the two roads of scientific research work at the end of last year. If we defeated bourgeois intellectuals theoretically at that time, then now we can say that their arguments have been proven bankrupt in practice.

Under the guidance of the Party's socialist scientific research policy, in terms of selecting topics and deciding on tasks, we must first have clear goals. Bourgeois intellectuals tout "science for science's sake," "science is the product of a scientist's genius," "the needs of national construction cannot be emphasized, only individual interests can be accommodated," and "emphasizing the needs of national construction is short-sighted utilitarianism, which obliterates science." We are completely opposed to them. We believe that scientific research must obey and serve the needs of socialist construction. We not only require it to play a general role in the national economy, but also require it to solve scientific and technological problems of great significance to the national economy.

Because the purpose of conducting research is to serve socialist construction, rather than starting from personal fame and gain and narrow interests, the process of solving problems should not be individual work and mutual secrecy, but should actively give play to collective strength and the wisdom of the masses, with cooperation and coordination both inside and outside the school, learning from practice, and learning from the masses. Because we want to solve the tasks of national construction and delve into reality, we will encounter many problems that need to be solved in actual production and our own practice, rather than going around in circles in books and magazines, struggling to find topics, or grasping some unimportant issues to conduct theoretical "research" that is divorced from reality, such as mathematical games. In addition, because tasks are carried out based on the needs of national construction, there is an infinite determination and drive to overcome difficulties and delve into progress. We will not be satisfied with certain achievements and stop moving forward, let alone seek convenience and do some sensational, easy work that is not of great significance to the national economy. Taking the Department of Hydraulic Engineering as an example, because they further clarified the idea of serving socialist construction, accepted construction tasks for graduation design topics, delved into the reality of production, and gave play to the enthusiasm and wisdom of teachers, students, and relevant personnel outside the school, they proposed many research tasks. In the short period of one month during the summer vacation, they carried out more than 130 major scientific research and technological innovations, exceeding the total of all scientific research of the department in the past two years, and the quality was very high. Based on delving into reality and actively practicing, science has found an infinite source of development and a huge driving force. Taking the Gaoyan Kou Reservoir they were working on as an example, the local area was very short of water, and farmers urgently demanded the construction of a reservoir, but the riverbed was covered with gravel and stones as deep as more than 60 meters, and the problem of water leakage was serious. Some bourgeois experts could neither start from the urgent needs of the people and be determined to overcome difficulties, nor could they jump out of the circle of book knowledge and were at a loss in the face of difficulties. They affirmed that the Gaoyan Kou Reservoir could not be built. However, the young people under the leadership of the Party responded heroically to the call of "If the farmers want to build a reservoir there, we will build it there," changing the method of some "experts" who started from books and closed their doors to do experiments. They delved into the site, pooled their efforts, overcame many difficulties, and after a series of experiments, finally successfully found a solution to the leakage problem. There are many examples like the Gaoyan Kou Reservoir. It can be seen from this that the key to the success of scientific research work in schools lies in implementing the principles of serving socialist construction, linking theory with practice, and giving play to collective strength.

Grasp the Cutting Edge, Vigorously Promote General Indigenous and Foreign Methods, and Achieve Comprehensive Blooming

In the march towards science and technology, a very important issue is what schools should advance towards. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The most important task of universities is to combine teaching content and do a good job in the research and experimentation of cutting-edge science and technology with all their strength." This is very correct. In the past six months, Tsinghua University has always attached great importance to cutting-edge science and technology. Because cutting-edge science and technology occupy an extremely important position in our country's construction and national defense, in addition, cutting-edge science and technology is the advanced stage of general science and technology, so focusing on cutting-edge science and technology can drive a considerable range of general science and technology. For example, after our school grasped the Three Gorges Water Conservancy Hub and power system work, the scientific research and production work of the Hydraulic Engineering and Electrical Engineering Departments had a guiding principle, which powerfully drove the research and production work of the entire department. Therefore, when arranging manpower and material resources, our school always puts cutting-edge science and technology tasks in the position of ensuring their completion first.

However, while focusing on the cutting edge, we also universally promote the general. Some people believe that universities should only engage in cutting-edge technology. As for general technology, that is the business of secondary technical schools or production units. We feel that this view is one-sided. First of all, cutting-edge technology is the advanced stage of general technology development, and general technology is the foundation for the development of cutting-edge technology. Without general technology, cutting-edge technology loses its basis. The entire process of the successful trial production of a numerically controlled milling machine controlled by a computer provides a powerful explanation for the above point of view. The Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University had been brewing the manufacture of this milling machine for one or two years, but it had not even produced a simple mechanical processing machine tool. After implementing work-study programs, they trial-produced five machine tools on July 1. On the basis of general production, accumulated experience, and within a short period of less than three months, they successfully trial-produced this cutting-edge product on October 1 as scheduled. Secondly, cutting-edge technology and general technology are not completely unrelated and mechanically separated, but are interrelated and mutually promoting. Taking the accelerator manufacturing work carried out by the Department of Engineering Physics as an example, without the support of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering in the general technology of machinery and electrical engineering, it would be difficult to move forward, let alone complete the trial production task in a relatively short period of time; conversely, without isotopes, the Department of Hydraulic Engineering would not be able to use it to serve the Three Gorges soil test work. Furthermore, the relationship between general technology and cutting-edge technology is not fixed, but can be transformed. For example, the ductile iron work carried out by the Foundry Teaching and Research Group was originally a general science and technology, but after the Foundry Teaching and Research Group completed the world's pioneering work of ductile iron rails and other work, the research work of ductile iron climbed to the throne of cutting-edge technology.

Socialist construction not only needs cutting-edge technology, but also needs general technology, so while focusing on cutting-edge technology, we cannot ignore general technology. For example, scientific research on micro-cars, 100 kV 0.075 microfarad capacitors, the indigenous method of manufacturing oil-impregnated bearings (Φ80), and 300 grade non-admixed coal-fired clay cement have significant national economic significance.

In the march towards science and technology, some people one-sidedly understand the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, requiring schools to undertake the same production tasks as factories. They are interested in the mass production of general finished products, but lack enthusiasm for scientific research and technological revolution. This makes it difficult for universities to give play to their own characteristics and strengths. We believe that universities should focus on the cutting edge while taking care of general technology. Taking the Department of Electrical Engineering as an example, they not only sent working teams to support the industrial construction of Handan, Dengfeng and other counties, but also carried out the construction of an AC calculation table and a power system dynamic simulation with international standards. They not only assisted schools and other units in solving the urgent needs of some motors, but also created experimental research equipment and conditions for developing ultra-gigantic Three Gorges Hydropower Station power plants and power systems. This enables the Department of Electrical Engineering to better exert its strength.

In the school's march towards science and technology, there is also the issue of "combining indigenous and foreign methods." The Party's policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" should be fully reflected in the school's production, teaching, and scientific research. Some people believe that "'indigenous' is low-level, and 'indigenous' methods are poor methods, which can only solve the urgent needs of the moment and cannot be a long-term solution." This view is also incorrect. Indigenous methods are actually original creations that combine with China's reality and are new paths opened up according to China's specific conditions. In the initial stage, it is of course inevitable that they will appear simple in some aspects, but with the development of things, today's simple methods may become complete methods tomorrow. Simplicity and low level are not the characteristics of indigenous methods, and foreign methods also have problems with low level and simplicity. Therefore, in the process of marching towards science and technology, our school has not only learned some world-advanced technologies, but also carried out a lot of production and scientific research work using indigenous methods. Taking the comprehensive utilization of fuel power plant combining indigenous and foreign methods jointly built by the Departments of Power, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Civil Engineering as an example, it has not only opened up a new path in technology for the cause of electricity for all in our country, but also set an example of combining indigenous and foreign methods, contributing to the large-scale development of small power plants and rural electrification in counties and townships in our country. They carried out more than 100 technical innovations and creations in their work and achieved double harvests in ideology and business, laying a solid foundation for improving teaching quality and carrying out scientific research.

Rapidly Extend Research Achievements to Production, and Constantly Revolutionize Technology

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen said: "Since science is to serve production, research achievements should be rapidly extended to production so that it can play a role in national economic construction." This instruction is very profound. If new scientific and technological achievements are not extended, it is essentially equivalent to giving up halfway; but to extend them, the work must be done thoroughly and completely, and the work cannot be stopped at the preliminary research or experimental stage, nor can it be stopped at the small sample production stage in the laboratory. We should carry out a series of tasks such as design, experimentation, trial production, research, production, and inspection that need to be solved to a stage that can be extended. When necessary, we should also write scientific reports, technical materials or specifications, textbooks, popular booklets, etc. For particularly important ones, we should also hold on-site meetings and organize visits. In the past six months, our school has been striving towards such a goal in the process of marching towards science and technology, and some work has now met such requirements. Taking the ductile iron rail work of the Foundry Teaching and Research Group of our school as an example, they have proved that the light rails they have made completely meet the requirements after a series of work such as trial production, process research, and chemical and physical performance inspection. However, they are not satisfied with the achievements of light rails, and continue to trial-produce medium and heavy rails. In this research work, they often go to the site for experiments, installing 32-kilogram medium-sized rails on the main line of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to withstand the test of practice. On the basis of successful experiments, they began to write scientific reports, and gave a comprehensive introduction at the national on-site meeting convened by the National Technology Commission, so as to extend this advanced scientific and technological achievement. Not only that, they also continue to explore the process methods of saving magnesite, looking for new spheroidizing agents, and using indigenous iron to make ductile iron and other scientific issues. Because the Foundry Teaching and Research Group of our school can continuously revolutionize technology and pay attention to the great significance of promotion work, it can achieve good results in the research work of ductile iron in a short period of time.

Extensively Mobilize the Masses, Break Down Superstition, Concentrate Forces, and Fiercely Attack Scientific Fortresses

Chairman Mao instructed us to emancipate our minds, break down superstitions, and promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. This has great significance and profound experience in our school's work of marching towards science and technology.

Half a year ago, there were still mysterious views on scientific research. It was felt that scientific research work could only be done by a few "experts" and "professors," and young teachers could not ask about it, let alone students, who were "processed" objects. But the practice of these few months has completely shattered these stale views. In this stage of work, not only young teachers and senior students have made great achievements, but also junior students have made admirable achievements. The 5 million electron volt electron accelerator made by the Department of Engineering Physics was made up of mostly students, in addition to a few young teachers, and their average age was less than 23 years old. Third-year students in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering created more than a dozen panels for the world's pioneering over-the-water earth dam experiment completed by the department, and achieved great results. On the contrary, those self-righteous "experts" and "professors" in the past have not made much satisfactory progress during this period, and some even played a role in promoting retreat in their work. why? One of the key issues is that young comrades let "politics take command and liberated their minds," while these "experts" did not have proletarian politics in command and were heavily superstitious, so they dared not think or do. Therefore, putting politics in command, emancipating the mind, breaking down superstition, and eliminating the mystery of scientific research, so that the masses can recognize their own strength, is an important condition for marching towards science and technology. Of course, we have no intention of ignoring the role of experts. Experts should also put politics in command, break down superstition, put themselves among the masses, and actively play their role.

The strength of individual people is always limited, and they must be organized to give play to collective strength and wisdom. Therefore, it is necessary to propose some inspiring projects to mobilize and organize the masses through it. More than 400 teachers, workers, and students (including students from both senior and junior grades) from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering of our school, under the leadership of the Party branch, and under the clear goal of the major task of the ultra-gigantic Three Gorges Water Conservancy Hub, were formed into a scientific camp fighting for the Three Gorges, attacking the scientific research tasks of the Three Gorges hydraulic engineering in a fighting posture. It has only been a month since then, and many important research topics have been carried out and completed. Similarly, the Department of Electrical Engineering fully mobilized the masses, mobilizing 200 teachers, workers, and students, and within just two months, produced the first AC calculation table with 12 generator components of 200 cycles made by our country.

After clearly proposing tasks and organizing the masses, it is also necessary to regularly lead them to engage in theoretical discussions. In the process of work, we should often conduct summaries, discussions, mutual inspiration, and mutual learning. Only in this way can we solve existing problems in a timely manner and give better play to the wisdom of the masses.

In the process of work, we must prevent the bias of closing the door to check data and do experiments. We must often delve into reality and the masses, learn from practice and the broad masses, learn from capable people, and learn from "outsiders." In the process of the preliminary design competition for the nine major buildings in Beijing, the Department of Architecture not only summarized and discussed in detail the advantages and disadvantages of the largest buildings in the world and the characteristics and styles of many buildings in our country, but also consulted construction workers, steel workers, farmers, and many other "insiders" and "outsiders." Practice has proved that this working method of frequent theoretical discussion, going deep into the site, and learning from the masses is an important guarantee for climbing the peak of science and technology.

In the process of marching towards science and technology, we should also give full play to the communist style and vigorously carry out cooperation work inside and outside the school. The reason why the Department of Mechanical Engineering was able to complete the major scientific research project of a numerically controlled milling machine controlled by a computer in a short period of time is inseparable from the strong cooperation of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, the Department of Automatic Control, and the Department of Electrical Engineering. Full and vigorous cooperation has become an indispensable factor for other units to help our school and our school to help other units complete certain major scientific production projects. In the future, we should continue to carry forward this noble communist style.

Turn the School into a Three-Union Base for Production, Teaching, and Scientific Research

The practice of productive labor in the past six months has proved that this is one of the fundamental links in implementing the Party's education policy. Running factories in schools closely integrates education with productive labor, greatly improves teaching quality, powerfully promotes scientific research, gives play to the production potential of universities, and makes more contributions to national industrial construction and technological innovation. In this way, schools gradually become three-union bases for production, teaching, and scientific research, promoting each other and complementing each other. In the past six months, although our school's production tasks have greatly increased, the school's teaching quality has greatly improved, and scientific research work has greatly advanced. Taking the graduation design of this year's graduates as an example, in the past, designs were based on hypothetical conditions. This year, they directly assumed certain production tasks with real swords and guns. As a result, all the students who participated in the actual production struggle received practical training in politics and business, and also made contributions to production. Two hundred and twenty-eight graduation designs were identified as excellent designs by relevant parties outside the school, of which 141 reached the advanced international or domestic level, and dozens of scientific papers were published in the Tsinghua University Journal. From the fact that third-year students majoring in automobiles and tractors in the Department of Power participated in automobile repair and finally wrote a book on automobile repair, it can be seen that after this class of students listened to half of the automobile repair course, half of the students continued to listen to the course, and the other half stopped listening to the course and participated in productive labor. A few months later, they made a comparison. The results proved that the students who participated in productive labor not only greatly exceeded the students who continued to listen to the course in terms of practical working ability and familiarity, but also exceeded the students who listened to the course in terms of automobile structure and theory. At the same time, they also compiled a book on automobile repair. The problem is also illustrated by the fact that first-year students in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering participated in actual measurement work and compiled a textbook "Hydraulic Engineering Surveying" with better quality and more advantages than in the past. Up to now, students of our school have compiled dozens of textbooks and technical materials. As a result of students' participation in productive labor in the past six months, the meaning of "college students" has undergone fundamental changes. They take classes, work, and do research, so they are gradually becoming multi-faceted talents who are both students, workers, engineering technicians, and scientific researchers. In the face of these facts: The view that running production in schools will reduce teaching quality is of course self-defeating.

Scientific research and production have a close relationship like flesh and blood. Of course, running production in schools will more directly and powerfully promote scientific research work in schools. As mentioned above, many of our school's production tasks are scientific research work in themselves. The creation or trial production of new products and instruments is mostly achieved by simultaneously solving many scientific research and production problems. Some production tasks directly or indirectly prepare material conditions and train cadres for scientific research work. Therefore, production and scientific research are combined and promote each other. In the past six months, our school has been able to achieve so many achievements in new scientific and technological achievements, which is the best proof of this point of view.

However, schools are ultimately different from other research institutions or production institutions. Its task is primarily to train people. The school's productive labor and scientific research must also fully pay attention to improving teaching quality and improving the level of scientific theory. It is not appropriate to simply emphasize theoretical study or simply emphasize practice. We must closely combine theory and practice, practice, recognition, re-practice, re-recognition, and cycle back and forth to infinity. In order to better achieve this goal, we need to turn the school into a three-union base for production, teaching, and scientific research and carry out unified arrangements to combine and promote each other, so as to cultivate talents for national construction more, faster, better, and more economically.

    高等学校科学研究工作的正确道路
    清华大学实行生产、教学、科学研究全面结合的体会
    高景德
    半年来，清华大学在贯彻执行党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针中，工作不断前进，高潮一个接着一个，而且一个高过一个，获得了生产、教学及科学研究的全面大丰收。仅就科学研究及新产品试制来说，根据最近的统计，半年来我校已经完成了八百四十四项较重大的项目，其中一百三十项达到了国际先进水平，五百二十二项达到了国内先进水平。有些项目的国民经济意义很大，水平很高；并且生产了产品三百八十种，为其他单位完成了设计及工程任务二百六十二项，约相当于十五万工作日的工作量，编写了教学大纲、技术资料、教科书等九十四种，教学计划、教学大纲、劳动计划等四百一十六份。半年来我校在生产、教学、科学研究上的成绩是很大的，不仅在数量、质量、速度以及规模上都大大地超过了往年，更重要的是从实际工作上彻底转变了我校教学及科学研究的方向及作法，为我校进行第二次教育革命及向科学技术进军奠定了巩固的基础。这是党的教育方针的胜利，这是党对科学研究领导的胜利。
    理论联系实际和发挥集体  力量是向科学进军的纲
    在这个问题上，我们曾经与资产阶级知识分子进行过很多次的争论，特别是去年年底的科学研究工作两条道路的大辩论。如果说，当时我们在理论上驳倒了资产阶级知识分子，那末，现在可以说，在实践中证明了他们的论点的破产。
    在党的社会主义科学研究方针的照耀下，在选题及决定任务方面，首先就要有明确的目的性。资产阶级知识分子标榜“为科学而科学”，“科学是科学家天才的产物”，“不能强调国家建设的需要，只能单纯迁就个人兴趣”，“强调国家建设的需要，就是目光短小的功利主义，就是抹煞科学”。我们和他们完全相反，我们认为科学研究必须服从并服务于社会主义建设的需要，不但要求它在国民经济上起一般的作用，而且要求它能解决对国民经济具有重大意义的科学技术问题。
    由于进行研究的目的是为社会主义建设服务，而不是从个人名利及狭隘兴趣出发，所以在解决问题的过程中，就不应该是个人单干，互相保密，而应当积极发挥集体力量及群众智慧，校内外互相协作配合，向实际请教，向群众请教。由于要解决国家建设的任务，深入了实际，就会在实际生产中及自己的实践中遇到很多需要解决的问题，而不是在书本杂志中绕来绕去，苦于找不到题目，或者抓住一些无关紧要的问题，进行一些数学游戏之类的理论脱离实际的“研究”。另外，由于任务是由国家建设的需要出发而进行，所以就有克服困难及钻研进取的无限的决心及干劲，就不会满足于某些已取得的成绩而停止不前，更不会贪图方便，做一些哗众取宠，轻而易举但对国民经济意义并不很大的工作。以水利系为例，由于他们进一步明确了为社会主义建设服务的思想，毕业设计题目接受了建设任务，深入了生产实际，发挥了教师、学生及校外有关人员的积极性及智慧，因之，他们提出了很多研究任务，并且在暑假短短的一月多的时间内，就进行了一百三十多项较大的科学研究和技术革新，超过了该系过去两年全部科学研究的总和，而且质量很高。在深入实际，积极实践的基础上，科学就找到了无限发展的源泉及巨大的动力。以他们所进行的高岩口水库为例，当地非常缺水，农民迫切要求兴修水库，但河床沙砾石复盖深达六十多公尺，漏水问题严重。某些资产阶级专家既不能从人民的迫切需要出发，下定决心克服困难，又不能跳出书本知识的圈子，在困难面前束手无策，他们肯定在高岩口不能兴修水库。而在党的领导下的青年人，却豪迈的响应了“农民要在那儿修水库，我们就在那儿把水库修起来”的号召，改变了某些“专家”们从书本出发关门做实验的办法。他们深入现场，群策群力，克服重重困难，进行了一系列的试验以后，终于胜利的找到了解决漏水的办法。像高岩口水库这样的例子是很多的。从这里可以看出，学校科学研究工作要有成就，首要关键在于贯彻为社会主义建设服务、理论联系实际和发挥集体力量的原则。
    抓住尖端，大搞一般土洋并举，全面开花
    在向科学技术进军中，很重要的一个问题就是学校应该向什么进军。邓小平同志指出：“大学的最重要的任务，就是要结合教学内容全力作好尖端科学技术的研究和试验”。这是非常正确的。半年来，清华大学对尖端科学技术一直非常重视。因为尖端科学技术在我国建设事业及国防事业中占着极重要的地位，另外，尖端科学技术是一般科学技术的高级阶段，所以重点抓住尖端科学技术，就可以带动相当范围的一般科学技术。例如，我校抓住了三峡水利枢纽及电力系统工作后，水利、电机等系的科学研究及生产工作就有了纲，有力地带动了全系的研究和生产工作。因此，我校在安排人力物力时，总是把尖端科学技术任务排在首先保证完成的位置。
    但是在重点抓住尖端的同时，我们也普遍地大搞一般。有人认为高等学校只应该搞尖端技术，至于一般技术，那是中等技术学校或生产单位的事。我们觉得这种看法是片面的。首先，尖端技术是一般技术发展的高级阶段，一般技术则是尖端技术发展的基础，离开了一般技术，尖端技术就失去了依据。电子计算机控制的程序控制铣床试验成功的全部过程给上述观点作了有力的说明。清华大学机械制造系酝酿制造这种铣床已有一、二年之久，但却连一台简易的机械加工机床都没有生产出来。实行勤工俭学以后，他们在7月1日试制出了五台机床，在一般生产的基础上，累积了经验，就在不到三个月的短短时间内，按期于10月1日胜利地试制成功了这一尖端产品。其次，尖端技术与一般技术并不是截然无关、机械分开的，而是相互关联、相互促进的。以工程物理系进行的加速器制造工作为例，如果没有机械制造系及电机系在机械及电机的一般技术方面的支持，就会寸步难行，更不可能在较短的时间内完成试制任务；反过来，没有同位素，水利系就不能利用它来为三峡土工试验工作服务。再其次，一般技术与尖端技术的关系并不是固定的，而是可以转化的。如铸工教研组所进行的球墨铸铁工作，原本是一般科学技术，但当铸工教研组完成了球墨铸铁铁轨等世界创举性的工作以后，球墨铸铁的研究工作又登上了尖端技术的宝座。
    社会主义建设不仅需要尖端技术，同时也需要一般技术，所以在重点抓住尖端技术的同时，不能忽视一般技术。例如微型汽车、一百千伏0.075微法电容器、土法制造含油轴承（Φ80），三百号无掺料石炭烧粘土水泥等项科学研究，就具有重大的国民经济意义。
    在向科学技术进军中，有人片面理解党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，要求学校担负起与工厂同样的生产任务。他们对大批生产一般成品有兴趣，对进行科学研究及搞技术革命缺乏热情。这就使高等学校很难发挥自己的特点及长处。我们认为，高等学校应当在照顾一般技术的同时，重点抓住尖端。以电机系为例，他们既派出了工作队支持邯郸、登封等县工业建设，又进行了具有国际水平的交流计算台及电力系统动态模拟的建设工作，不仅协助校内外解决了生产急需的一部分电机，同时也为开展超巨型的三峡水电站的发电站及电力系统创造了实验研究设备及条件，这就使电机系能够更好地发挥自己的力量。
    学校向科学技术进军中，还有一个“土洋并举”的问题。党的“土洋并举”的方针，应当在学校的生产、教学及科学研究上得到充分的反映。有人认为“‘土’就是低级，‘土’办法就是穷办法，只能解决当务之急，不能为长久之计。”这种看法也是不正确的。土办法实际上是结合我国实际的独创，是根据我国具体条件开辟的新途径，它在开始阶段，当然未免在某些方面表现简陋，但是随着事物的发展，今天简陋的办法，明天也许就会变成完整的办法。简陋及低级并不是土办法的特征，洋办法同样也有低级及简陋的问题。所以我校在向科学技术进军的过程中，一方面学习了某些世界先进技术，一方面也进行了很多土办法的生产及科学研究工作。以动力、电机、工程化学、土建等系共同建设的土洋结合的燃料综合利用电厂为例，它不仅为我国全民办电的事业在技术上开辟了一条新的道路，而且也树立了土洋并举的范例，为我国县、乡大办小型电厂和农村电气化作出了贡献。他们在工作中进行了一百多项的技术革新和创造，在思想、业务上获得了双丰收，为提高教学质量及开展科学研究工作打下了巩固的基础。
    把研究成果迅速推广到生产中去，在技术上要不断革命
    聂荣臻副总理说：“科学既然要为生产服务，研究成果就应该迅速推广到生产中去，使它在国民经济建设中发挥作用。”这个指示是非常深刻的。如果不对科学技术新成果加以推广，实质上就等于半途而废；但要推广，就必须把工作做彻底，做完整，就不能把工作停留在初步研究或试验阶段，也不能停留在实验室的小量样品生产阶段，而应该把需要解决的设计、试验、试制、研究、生产、检验等一系列工作进行到能够推广的阶段，必要时还应该写出科学报告、技术资料或规范、教科书、普及册子等，特别重大者还应该举办现场会议，组织参观等工作。半年来我校在向科学技术进军的过程中，是争取朝着这样一个目标前进的，现在有些工作已经达到了这样的要求。以我校铸工教研组的球墨铸铁铁轨工作为例，他们从试制开始，经过工艺研究、化学及物理性能检验等一系列工作后，已经证明他们所制出的轻铁轨完全合乎要求。但是他们并不满足于轻型铁轨的成就，又继续试制中型及重型铁轨。在这一研究工作中，他们经常到现场进行试验，把三十二公斤的中型铁轨安装在石景山钢铁厂的干线上经受实践的考验，在试验成功的基础上，他们就开始编写科学报告，在国家技术委员会召开的全国现场会议上进行全面的介绍，以便将这项先进的科学技术成果加以推广。不仅如此，他们还继续探索节约镁砂的工艺方法，寻找新的球化剂，利用土铁做球墨铸铁等科学问题。由于我校铸工教研组能够在技术上不断革命，注意到推广工作的重大意义，因此就能够在很短的时间内在球墨铸铁的研究工作中获得了良好的结果。
    广泛发动群众、破除迷信，集中兵力、猛攻科学堡垒
    毛主席指示我们要解放思想，破除迷信，提倡敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，这在我校向科学技术进军的工作中有着巨大的意义和深刻的体会。
    半年前，人们对科学研究还存在着神秘观点，觉得科学研究工作似乎只能是少数“专家”“教授”的事情，青年教师是不能问津的，至于作为“加工”对象的学生，更摸不上边。但是这几个月的实践已经把这些陈腐的观点彻底粉碎了。在这阶段的工作中，不但青年教师及高年级学生做出了巨大的成绩，而且低年级的学生也做出了令人佩服的成绩。工程物理系所制的五百万电子伏特的电子加速器，除了少数年轻教师外，绝大部分是学生，他们的平均年龄还不到二十三岁。水利系三年级学生为该系所完成的世界创举性的过水土坝实验，创造了十多种面板，获得了很大成绩。相反的，倒是过去那些自以为是的“专家”、“教授”，在这一段时间内并没有做出多少令人满意的成绩，甚至有些人在工作中还起了促退作用。为什么？关键问题之一，就是青年同志们让“政治挂了帅，解放了思想”，而这些“专家”们由于无产阶级政治没有挂帅，迷信重重，既不敢想，也不敢干。所以政治挂帅，解放思想，破除迷信，打掉科学研究的神秘感，使群众认识自己的力量，是向科学技术进军的一个重要条件。当然，我们决没有忽视专家作用的意思，专家也应该政治挂帅，破除迷信，把自己放在群众之中，积极发挥自己的作用。
    个别人的力量总是有限的，还必须把他们组织起来发挥集体力量及智慧，所以就需要提出一些振奋人心的项目，通过它来发动群众，组织群众。我校水利系教师、职工、学生（高低年级学生均有）四百多人，在党总支的领导下，在超巨型三峡水利枢纽的重大任务的明确目标下，编成了一个为三峡而战的科学营，以战斗的姿态向三峡水工科学研究任务进攻，至今为时不过一月，已经进行了和完成了很多重要研究课题。同样，电机系充分发动群众，动员了二百名教师职工及学生，为时不过二月，制成我国第一次自制的二百周波的十二个发电机元件的交流计算台。
    明确的提出任务，把群众组织起来之后，还要经常领导他们务虚。在工作过程中，经常进行总结、讨论，互相启发，互相学习。只有这样才能及时地把存在的问题加以解决，更好地发挥群众的智慧。
    在工作过程中，要防止关门查资料做实验的偏向，必须经常深入实际及群众，向实际和广大群众请教，向能人请教，向“外行”请教。建筑系在进行北京市九大建筑的初步设计方案竞选过程中，不仅详细总结讨论了世界各国最大建筑的优缺点，我国许多建筑物的特点及风格，还向建筑工人、钢铁工人、农民以及许多其他方面的“内行”及“外行”请教。实践证明这种经常务虚，深入现场，向群众请教的工作方法，是攀上科学技术高峰的重要保证。
    在向科学技术进军的过程中，还应该充分发挥共产主义的风格，大力进行校内外的协作工作。机械系所以能够在短期内完成用电子计算机控制的程序控制铣床的重大科学研究项目，是与北京第一机床厂、自动控制系及电机系的大力协作分不开的。充分而大力的协作已经成为其他单位帮助我校及我校帮助其他单位完成某些重大科学生产项目的不可缺的因素。今后我们还应该继续发扬这种共产主义的高尚风格。
    把学校变成生产、教学、科学研究的三联基地
    半年来的生产劳动的实践证明，这是贯彻执行党的教育方针的根本环节之一。学校办工厂使教育同生产劳动密切结合，大大提高了教学质量，有力推动了科学研究，发挥了高等学校的生产潜力，对国家工业建设和技术革新作出了更多的贡献。这样，就使学校逐步变成生产、教学、及科学研究的三联基地，互相推动，相辅相成。半年来，虽然我校生产任务有很大增加，但是学校的教学质量大大提高了，科学研究工作大大前进了。以本届毕业生的毕业设计为例，过去是根据假设条件进行设计，今年则是真刀真枪直接担负了一定的生产任务，结果，所有参加了实际生产斗争的同学都在政治上、业务上得到了实际锻炼，同时对生产也作出了贡献。毕业设计中有二百二十八个被校外有关方面鉴定为优秀设计，其中还有一百四十一项达到了国际或国内的先进水平，在清华大学学报上发表了数十篇科学论文。从动力系汽车及拖拉机专业的三年级学生参加汽车修理，最后写出一本汽车修理学这一件事情来看，这班学生一同听了一半汽车修理学课后，一半学生继续听课下去，另一半学生停止听课，而参加了生产劳动，几月之后，他们进行了对比，结果证明参加生产劳动的同学不仅在实际工作能力及熟悉程度上大大超过继续听课的同学，而且在汽车结构及理论方面也超过听课的同学，同时他们还编写了一本汽车修理学。水利系一年级学生参加实际测量工作后，编写了质量比过去好优点多的“水利工程测量学”教科书一本，也说明了这问题。到现在为止，我校学生已编写了数十种教科书、技术资料。半年来我校学生参加生产劳动的结果，已经使“大学生”的含义发生了根本性的变化，他们又上课，又做工，又研究，因而逐渐变成了身兼学生、工人、工程技术人员、科学研究人员的多面手。在这些事实面前：认为学校搞生产要降低教学质量的观点当然不攻自破。
    科学研究工作和生产本来就有着血肉一般的亲密关系，学校搞生产工作当然会更直接而有力的推动学校的科学研究工作。如前所述，我校很多生产任务本身就是科学研究工作，新产品、仪器的创造或试制成功，多是同时解决了许多科学研究和生产课题才取得的，有的生产任务则是直接或间接为科学研究工作准备物质条件和锻炼干部，因此生产和科学研究是相互结合，而又相互推动的。半年来，我校能够在科学技术新成就方面取得这样多的成绩，是这一论点的最好证明。
    但学校究竟不同于其他的研究机关或生产机构。它的任务首先是培养人，学校的生产劳动和科学研究也必须充分注意提高教学质量及提高科学理论水平。单纯强调理论学习和单纯强调实践都是不恰当的，必须把理论和实践密切结合起来，实践、认识、再实践，再认识，循环往复，以至无穷。为了更好地达到这一目的，就需要把学校变成生产、教学、及科学研究的三联基地并进行统一安排，使之互相结合 ，互相推动。以便更多、更快、更好、更省地培养建设国家的人才。
