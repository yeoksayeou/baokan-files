    Investing in Happiness

    Female members of the "August 1st" pastoral cooperative in Sunit Right Banner, Inner Mongolia, excitedly carried their ancestral, exquisitely crafted jewelry made of pure silver and coral, and gathered at the pastoral cooperative's management committee. At this moment, someone shouted: The female members are here to build factories on the grasslands!

    Since September, the cooperative has already built small factories on the pasture, such as milk powder, leather, and wool product processing plants, and also established nurseries and public canteens. However, sewing various garments still took up a lot of the female members' time, so everyone wanted to set up a sewing factory. The jewelry they held in their hands today was their self-raised capital for building the sewing factory.

    Demqiuk, the Party branch secretary of the pastoral cooperative, and Langtao, the cooperative director, warmly received the female members. Subude, the Mongolian female deputy director, and her elderly mother, handed over a package to the Party branch secretary containing seventy-three taels of silver ornaments adorned with coral and pearls, her dowry from her parents thirty years ago. She said, we are willing to turn these "dead treasures" into "living treasures" to build socialism on the grasslands.

      "I also want to invest in happiness," an old woman handed a gleaming silver-sheathed Mongolian knife to the branch secretary. Her name was Seerji, and the knife was her husband's memento. In the past, herders kept such mementos as permanent commemorations. Mother Seerji felt that building a factory would be the best commemoration. Then, a middle-aged woman named Decele handed two gold rings, each weighing more than one qian, and a piece of pure gold weighing four qian to the cooperative director. As early as 1946, Kuomintang bandit troops robbed Decele's family of all their clothes and bedding and beat them, demanding gold and silver. But she didn't give them a single cent of silver.

    More and more women gathered. In less than an hour, they invested a total of more than 389 taels of silver, more than 189 taels of coral, and more than six qian of gold.

    向幸福投资
    内蒙古苏尼特右旗“八一”牧业社女社员兴冲冲地抱着她们世代相传、用纯银和珊瑚精制成的首饰，聚集到牧业社管理委员会。这时，有人嚷嚷着：女社员们在草原上兴建工厂来了！
    从9月以来这个社已经在牧场上兴建了乳粉、皮革、毛制品加工厂等小型工厂，还办了托儿所、公共食堂。但是缝制各种服装还占去了女社员不少时间，大家就想办个缝纫厂。今天她们手里拿着的首饰，就是她们自筹资金，兴建缝纫厂的。
    牧业社党支部书记德姆其克和社主任朗套热情地招待了女社员们，蒙古族女副主任苏布德和她老母亲，拿着一包三十年前她双亲送给她的嫁妆——七十三两重的银制和用珊瑚珍珠串成的装饰品，递给了党支书。她说，我们愿把这些“死宝”，变成“活宝”，在草原上建设社会主义。
      “我也要向幸福投资”，一位老妈妈把一把闪闪发亮的银制套的蒙古刀，递给支部书记。她叫色尔吉，那把刀是她丈夫的遗物。从前，牧民们把这种遗物，作为永久纪念。色尔吉妈妈觉得建立起工厂，就是最好的纪念。接着，一个名叫得策力的中年妇女，也把两个各一钱多重的金戒指和一块四钱重的纯金，递给了社主任。早在1946年，国民党匪军把得策力一家人的衣被都给抢光，还殴打着要金银。但她没拿出一分银。
    妇女们越聚越多。不到一小时，共投资三百八十九两多银子一百八十九两多珊瑚和六钱多金子。
