From Greening to Landscaping
Deputy Director of the Greening Department, Beijing Forestry College Chen Junyu

“Deep mountains, distant mountains are forest mountains,
Near mountains, low mountains are flower and fruit mountains;
Farmland and cultivated land are networked with trees,
Terraced fields and embankments are mulberry gardens;
Every road is shaded by trees,
Every city and town is landscaped.”

This is a beautiful picture provided by Shanxi Province in its landscaping plan. After the basic realization of communization and bumper harvests in food production across the country, people are full of energy and have new interests and requirements for greening work. They have successively proposed to realize landscaping throughout the country and build the motherland into a large socialist garden.

“Landscaping” was originally an old term, but “landscaping” has a new meaning. In the past, landscaping referred to artificially arranged gardens and parks, generally small in area, mostly for beautification purposes. However, the landscaping proposed now cannot be narrowly understood as building some gardens and creating some forests. In terms of scope, content, and requirements, it far exceeds general greening.

Landscaping roughly includes the following three basic characteristics:

The scale of landscaping is extremely grand and the momentum is incomparably magnificent. The so-called landscaping is to gradually plant trees, create forests, plant grass, and plant flowers rationally and according to local conditions on all necessary and possible urban and rural land, centered on production and combined with the needs of life, and carry out other measures (such as operating sideline businesses, opening up cultural and entertainment facilities, adding waterscapes in combination with famous mountains and rivers, and building rockeries, pavilions, terraces, etc.). Obviously, this has greatly exceeded the scope of planting a few pots of flowers, opening up several gardens or parks, greening around houses and in mountainous areas, but making the whole country a beautiful place with lush trees, blooming flowers, clear mountains and rivers, and singing birds and fragrant flowers.

Secondly, the content of landscaping is richer than general greening. It not only has gardens and parks, but more importantly, it has forest belts and orchards; it not only has trees and flowers dotted around famous mountains and rivers, but also produces rice, wheat, melons, fruits, lotus, water chestnuts, fish, and shrimps; it not only has beautiful places for people to work and rest, but also is equipped with rich and educational cultural and entertainment facilities. The result of landscaping will enable urban and rural people to work and live in a fresh and beautiful environment. At the same time, people can also obtain timber, fuel, fruits, vegetables, grains, oils, aquatic products, medicinal materials, spices, pasture, honey, silk... numerous agricultural products from landscaping, forming a rich, colorful and beautiful new type of production enterprise.

The requirements for landscaping are obviously much higher than those for general greening. While greening, it is further required to beautify, fragrance, sanitize, and produce. If greening mainly refers to planting trees in mountainous areas, open spaces, factories, mines, neighborhoods, and around houses, then now we must also consider how to arrange trees, flowers, rice fields, and lotus ponds in a way that is appropriate, varied, meets specifications, and is cleverly combined with mountains, rivers, and buildings to become a beautiful unified body. In the past, only planting green trees was considered, and proper coordination with fragrant flowers, fragrant grasses, fish ponds, and beehives was not given enough attention, so that there was color, fragrance, and by-products. In the past, not enough attention was paid to planting trees on flat land and grass on slopes, and the plant's effects of regulating temperature and humidity, preventing wind, shielding smoke, eliminating noise, killing bacteria, maintaining water and soil, and purifying air were not fully utilized. In the future, it should be fully strengthened to ensure cleanliness and hygiene everywhere, and fresh air.

Recently, the forestry department has decided to accelerate the implementation of the policy of landscaping urban and rural areas across the country in accordance with the needs of the masses. The enthusiasm of the masses in various places for landscaping work is even higher. For example, people in the Beijing area have decided that, on the basis of great development in production, they can roughly achieve the "three-thirds system" of using one-third of the land for growing food, one-third of the land for leisure, and one-third of the land for landscaping within three years. By that time, we will truly achieve the beautiful environment as instructed by Vice Chairman Zhu, where "timber is inexhaustible, melons and fruits are inexhaustible, and mulberry tea is inexhaustible."

### 从绿化到园林化

    从绿化到园林化
    北京林业学院绿化系副主任　陈俊愉
    “深山远山森林山，
    近山低山花果山；
    农田耕地林网化，
    梯田地埂桑园化；
    条条道路林荫化，
    个个城乡园林化。”
    这是山西省在它们的园林化的规划中为人们提供的一幅美丽的图画。在全国各地基本实现公社化和粮食大丰收之后，人们都干劲冲天，对绿化工作有了新的兴趣和要求，纷纷提出了要在全国范围内实现园林化，把祖国建设成为一个社会主义的大花园。
    “园林”本来是个老名词，但是“园林化”却有了新的涵义。所谓园林，过去都指人工布置的花园、公园而言，一般面积较小，大多是仅以美化为主要目的。但是现在提出的园林化，既不能狭隘地理解为建一些园、造一些林，又在范围、内容和要求上远远超过了一般绿化。
    园林化大体包括以下三个基本特点：
    园林化的规模异常宏大，气魄无比雄伟。所谓园林化，就是要逐渐在全国范围内，在一切必要和可能的城乡土地上，都以生产为中心，结合生活需要，合理而因地制宜地植树、造林、种草、栽花，并进行其他措施（如经营副业、辟设文化娱乐设施、结合山川名胜增辟水景、修筑假山、亭、榭等）。显然，这已大大超越以往种几盆花、开辟若干花园或公园、四旁绿化或山区造林的范围，而是让全国都成为林木葱茏、百卉争荣、山清水秀、鸟语花香的美妙境地。
    其次，园林化的内容比一般绿化更为丰富。它不仅有花园、公园，更重要的是有林带、果园；不仅有树木花草点缀山川名胜，而且生产稻、麦、瓜、果、莲、菱、鱼、虾；不仅有供人工作和休息的优美场所，还配备了丰富而有教育意义的文化娱乐设施。园林化的结果，将使城市和乡村人民工作、生活在清新美丽的环境之中。同时人们还可以从园林化中取得木材、燃料、果、蔬、粮、油、水产、药材、香料、牧草、蜂蜜、蚕丝……众多的农产品，构成一种丰富多采、美不胜收的新型生产事业。
    园林化的要求显然比普遍绿化是大大提高了，在绿化的同时，进而要求美化、香化、卫生化、生产化。如果绿化主要指的是在山区、旷地、厂矿、街坊和“四旁”等处普遍植树的话，那么现在还要考虑怎样把树木、花草、稻田、莲池配置得各得其所，参差有致，既合规格，又有变化，并且和山川建筑巧妙地结合起来，成为一片美丽的统一体。以往只考虑遍栽绿树，现在就要适当配合香花、芳草、鱼塘，蜂房，做到有色、有香、有副产。从前对平地种树、坡地种草重视不够，未能充分发挥植物调节温度、湿度、防风、蔽烟、消声、杀菌、保持水土、净化空气等一系列的保健效益，今后便应全面加强，做到处处清洁卫生、空气新鲜。
    最近，林业部门已根据群众的这种要求，决定加速实现全国城乡园林化的方针。各地群众对园林化的工作更是热情高涨。例如北京地区的人们决定在生产大发展的基础上，大抵三年内就可实现用三分之一的土地种粮食、三分之一的土地休闲、三分之一的地方搞园林的“三三制”。到那时，真要做到朱副主席所指示的“木材用不完、瓜果吃不完、桑茶采不完”而又环境优美的境地。
