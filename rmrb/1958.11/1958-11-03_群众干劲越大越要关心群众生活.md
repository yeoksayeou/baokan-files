Some people say that current industrial and agricultural production is busy enough, why bother with a major inspection of culture, education, health, and living welfare? Does productive intensity mean we can disregard the lives of the masses? We say that the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more we must care for their lives.

**Production Develops, Life Improves, Production Develops Further—This is the Law of Socialist Economic Development**

Without a doubt, it is a major premise to muster enthusiasm, to fight hard, and to overcome all difficulties to develop production. However, no matter how soaring the enthusiasm, people still need to eat and sleep. Without enough food and sleep, how can enthusiasm be sustained? To gradually improve the material and cultural living standards of the people on the basis of vigorously developing production, thereby more powerfully promoting the development of production, this is our Party's policy and also the law of socialist economic development. At no time should we forget it. Especially on the current iron and steel front, with millions of people in the province on the mountains, ensuring they eat well and sleep well is necessary to consolidate their selfless labor enthusiasm and produce more and better steel.

**The More Collectivized People's Lives Are, the More Party Leadership is Needed**

Our Party is the leader of the people. What does it lead? Generally speaking, the first thing is to lead thought, which is to put politics in command. Political and ideological work is the soul of all work, and the people must be educated with communist thought. Have we done this? Yes, we have achieved success. Of course, we should do better in the future. The second thing is to lead production. Developing industrial and agricultural production is the center of the Party's work. Have we done this? Yes, we have made great achievements, especially this year, with an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. Of course, we should redouble our efforts to strive for an even greater leap forward. The third thing is to lead life. Some people say, "Life also needs leadership? Who doesn't know how to live?" Under the socialist system, the collectivization of people's lives must be handled under the leadership of the Party, relying on the strength of the people. The more collectivized people's lives are, the more Party leadership is needed. The Party is the organizer of the people's lives, and the Party's task is to make the people's lives better and better.

**Grasp Communist Education and Care for the Lives of the Masses in Production**

Generally speaking, everyone has done these three major tasks. However, some places sometimes have not closely linked these three major tasks. Originally, these three major tasks are consistent and interconnected. Leading thought, leading production, and leading life means leading people and caring for people. This is the comprehensive responsibility of every leader, and they should not only be busy with production but also neglect life. Now, iron and steel production, agricultural production, and various tasks are all in the midst of the Great Leap Forward. Why are some places doing better and some places doing worse? The main key lies in: whether the three things of thought, production, and life are comprehensively led? Whether they are good at grasping communist ideological education in the intense production movement, while also caring for the lives of the masses meticulously?

Some people say that if we have to handle this and that, isn't our work too complicated? It sounds complicated, but it is actually very simple. We are doing the work of people. The Party constantly teaches us to rely on the people for everything and to do everything for the people. Therefore, we have the responsibility to lead the people's thought, production, and life.

Some comrades sometimes do not understand the correct relationship between developing production and improving life. In the distribution of agricultural production income this year, they only emphasized expanding public accumulation, while neglecting to appropriately improve the people's lives while increasing accumulation. They did not see that the ultimate goal of socialist revolution and socialist construction is to improve the people's lives. Otherwise, what are we doing it for? The superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system lies in its ability to promote the development of productive forces and in its ability to meet the needs of the people. As social production continues to develop, the needs of the people also continue to grow. Can the needs of the people be absolutely satisfied? No. The people's needs in life can only be relatively satisfied with the development of social production. The people's demand to improve their lives constantly promotes the development of production; conversely, the continuous development of production gradually satisfies the needs of the people's lives. Our real life has already proven this principle.

Is it necessary to expand public accumulation? It is very necessary. Without expanding accumulation, it is impossible to expand reproduction, and it is impossible to adapt to the needs of production development. However, it is necessary to clarify that the purpose of expanding reproduction is definitely not for production for the sake of production, but for industrialization, mechanization, electrification, for saving the people's physical labor, reducing labor time, improving labor productivity, and improving the lives of the working people.

**Obey Long-Term Interests, But Also Take Care of Temporary Interests**

Some comrades say that temporary interests must obey long-term interests. This is of course correct. However, there is also an indispensable point, which is to take care of temporary interests. On the one hand, we require individual and partial interests to obey collective and national interests; on the other hand, we should also correctly combine the interests of individuals, collectives, and the state. This year's Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, working hard for a year, production has increased a lot, and life should be appropriately improved, so that everyone is happy and in a good mood, and redoubles their efforts to strive for a greater leap forward in production next year.

Is it better to distribute a little more this year, appropriately improve the people's lives, so that everyone is happy and in a good mood? Or is it better to only focus on increasing accumulation this year, without paying attention to appropriately improving the people's lives, so that everyone is not so happy and not so comfortable? Comparing the two, which one is more in line with long-term interests? Obviously, only the former is in line with long-term interests.

From this, it can be seen that the views and practices of opposing caring for the lives of the masses with developing production, opposing expanding public accumulation with increasing consumption, opposing the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual people, and opposing conditionally and appropriately improving life with long-term interests are all one-sided and wrong. In today's rapidly developing production, if we do not gradually improve the material and cultural lives of the masses with the development of production, then it can only show that our own communist ideological consciousness is not high and our mass viewpoint is not strong!

**Insufficient Attention to Eliminating the Four Pests and Paying Attention to Hygiene is a Manifestation of Not Caring for the Lives of the Masses**

The Party and Chairman Mao have always cared for the lives of the people meticulously. For example, eliminating schistosomiasis. Had we talked about it in the past? Yes, we had. Were we very concerned? No. Chairman Mao, in response to our thinking, raised the issue of eliminating schistosomiasis for discussion at the Hangzhou Conference in the winter of 1955, and immediately brought in the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Health to discuss how to eliminate schistosomiasis. At many meetings, Chairman Mao asked about the situation of eliminating schistosomiasis. Recently, Chairman Mao saw the news in the People's Daily that Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, had eliminated schistosomiasis, and was so excited that he "had many thoughts and could not sleep at night." When "the breeze was gentle and the sun was shining," he "looked towards the south and happily took up his pen" to write two poems "Farewell to the God of Plague." We see how meticulously Chairman Mao cares for the lives of the people! For example, eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene. Have we paid attention to it? We can't say we haven't paid attention to it. But not enough attention. Why is there insufficient attention to eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene? This is a manifestation of our backward thinking and our lack of care for the lives of the masses. Chairman Mao, in response to our thinking, mentioned eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene in almost every speech at the meetings. It can be said that he has grasped this matter thoroughly. This time, Chairman Mao also asked about this situation when he went to Wuhan. We see how meticulously Chairman Mao cares for the lives of the people! For example, in the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production since this year, the broad masses of people have been enthusiastic and fighting hard day and night. Chairman Mao has repeatedly educated us that hard work should be combined with rest and that production should be carried out rhythmically. This time, Chairman Mao instructed us in Wuhan that we should have a holiday on National Day, have a meal together, hold a celebration meeting, and let everyone appropriately improve their lives after the great harvest, so that everyone is happy and joyful. We see how meticulously Chairman Mao cares for the lives of the people! Recently, when Chairman Mao, Comrade Shaoqi, Premier Zhou, and Vice Chairman Zhu went to various places to inspect, they all cared for the lives of the masses meticulously. Caring for the lives of the masses and paying attention to working methods are the glorious traditions of our Party. As early as 1934, Chairman Mao wrote a famous article on this topic. Up to now, every time we read this article, we receive a profound education.

### 群众干劲越大越要关心群众生活

    群众干劲越大越要关心群众生活
    王任重
    有人说，目前工农业生产够忙了，还搞什么文教、卫生、生活福利大检查。难道生产紧张，就可以不顾群众生活吗？我们说，群众的干劲越大，越是要关心群众生活。
    生产发展生活提高生产更发展这是社会主义经济发展的规律
    毫无疑问，要鼓足干劲，要苦战，要克服一切困难发展生产，这是大前提。但是，不管干劲怎么冲天再冲天，仍然必须吃饭、睡觉。吃不饱，睡不好，干劲哪能持久？在大力发展生产的基础上，逐步提高人民群众的物质和文化生活水平，从而更加有力地推动生产的发展，这是我们党的方针，也是社会主义经济发展的规律。在任何时候，我们都不应当忘记它。特别在目前的钢铁战线上，全省几百万人上山，要保证他们吃的饱，睡的好，才能巩固他们的忘我劳动的热情，才能生产更多更好的钢铁。
    人民的生活越是集体化就越需要党的领导
    我们党是人民群众的领导者。领导些什么呢？大体说来，第一件事情是领导思想，就是要政治挂帅。政治思想工作是一切工作的灵魂，要用共产主义思想教育人民。这件事情我们做了没有？做了，做的有成绩。当然，今后还应当做得更好。第二件事情是领导生产。发展工农业生产，这是全党工作的中心。这件事情我们做了没有，做了，做的成绩很大，特别是今年工业农业生产上出现了空前未有的大跃进。当然，我们还应当加倍努力，争取更大的跃进。第三件事情是领导生活。有人说，生活还要领导，谁不会生活？在社会主义制度下，人们的生活集体化必须在党的领导下依靠人民群众的力量来办理。人民的生活越是集体化，就越需要党的领导。党是人民群众生活的组织者，党的任务就是要使人民群众的生活越过越好。
    在生产中既要抓紧共产主义教育，又要关心群众生活
    一般说来，这三件大事，大家都做了的。不过，有些地方有的时候没有把这三件大事紧密地联系起来。本来，这三件大事是一致的，互相结合的。领导思想，领导生产，领导生活，就是领导人、关心人。这是每一个领导者应当全面负责的，不应当只忙生产而不管生活。现在，钢铁生产、农业生产、各项工作都处在大跃进中，为什么有的地方搞得好一点，有的地方搞得差一点？主要关键在于：是否把思想、生产、生活三件事全面地领导起来？是否善于在紧张的生产运动中，既抓紧了共产主义思想教育，而又无微不至地关心群众生活？
    有人说，这也要办，那也要办，是不是我们的工作太复杂了？说起来很复杂，其实也很简单。我们是做人的工作，党经常教导我们，一切依靠人民群众，一切为了人民群众。所以，对于人民的思想、生产、生活，我们都有责任领导。
    有的同志有时搞不清发展生产和改善生活的正确关系。在今年农业生产收益的分配问题上，他们只强调扩大公共积累，而忽视在增加积累的同时，适当改善人民生活。他们没有看到，社会主义革命和社会主义建设的最终目的都是为了改善人民的生活。要不，我们为了什么呢？社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越的地方就在于它能促进生产力的发展，在于它能满足人民群众的需要。社会生产不断发展，人民的需要也就不断增长。能不能绝对地满足人民的需要呢？办不到。人民生活的需要只能随着社会生产的发展而得到相对的满足。人民的改善生活的要求，不断促进生产的发展；反过来，生产的不断发展，逐步满足人民生活的需要。我们的现实生活已经证明了这个道理。
    要不要扩大公共积累？很必要。不扩大积累，就不能扩大再生产，就不能适应生产发展的需要。不过要弄清楚，扩大再生产的目的，决不是为了生产而生产。而是为了搞工业化、机械化、电气化，为了节省人民的体力劳动，减少劳动时间，提高劳动生产率，改善劳动人民的生活。
    要服从长远利益也要照顾暂时利益
    有的同志说，暂时利益要服从长远利益。这当然是对的。不过还有一条不可缺少，那就是要照顾暂时利益。一方面，我们要求个人的、局部的利益服从集体的、国家的利益；另一方面，我们还应当把个人、集体和国家三者的利益正确地结合起来。今年工农业大跃进，苦干一年，生产增加很多，应当把生活适当地改善一下，使大家欢天喜地，心情舒畅，加倍努力，争取明年的生产出现更大的跃进。
    是今年多分一点，适当地改善一下人民的生活，使大家欢天喜地、心情舒畅呢？还是今年只顾增加积累，不注意适当改善人民生活，使大家不太欢喜、不太舒畅呢？两者比较起来，何者更符合于长远利益呢？很显然，只有前者才符合于长远利益。
    由此可见，把关心群众生活和发展生产对立起来，把扩大公共积累和增加消费对立起来，把国家、集体和人民群众的个人利益对立起来，把有条件地适当改善生活和长远利益对立起来等等看法和做法，都是片面的错误的。在生产正在突飞猛进的今天，如果我们不使群众的物质文化生活随着生产的发展逐步改善，那末只能说明我们自己的共产主义思想觉悟不高，群众观点不强！
    对除四害讲卫生注意不够就是不关心群众生活的表现
    党和毛主席一向是无微不至地关心人民群众生活的。例如，消灭血吸虫病，过去我们说过没有？说过。是不是很关心？不是。毛主席针对我们的这种思想情况，在1955年冬季杭州会议的时候，把消灭血吸虫的问题提到会议讨论，并且立即把卫生部的负责同志找来商量如何消灭血吸虫。许多次会议上，毛主席都问过关于消灭血吸虫的情况。最近，毛主席在人民日报上看到江西省余江县消灭了血吸虫的消息，兴奋得“浮想联翩，夜不能寐”，在“微风拂煦，旭日临窗”的时候，“遥望南天，欣然命笔”，写了两首“送瘟神”的诗。我们看，毛主席是如何无微不至地关心人民群众的生活啊！又如，除四害讲卫生，我们注意了没有？不能说不注意。但是注意的很不够。为什么对除四害讲卫生注意不够？这是我们思想落后的一种表现，是我们对群众生活不够关心的表现。毛主席针对我们的这种思想，差不多在每次会议上的讲话，都要提到除四害讲卫生，可以说是一竿子扎到底地抓住这件事情。这次，毛主席到武汉也问了这方面的情况。我们看，毛主席是如何无微不至地关心人民群众的生活啊！又如，在今年以来的工业农业生产大跃进当中，广大人民群众干劲冲天，日夜苦战，毛主席反复地教育我们，要苦战和休整相结合，要有节奏地进行生产。这次毛主席到武汉，指示我们，在国庆节这一天要放假，要会餐，要开庆祝会，要大家在大丰收之后，适当地改善生活，要让大家欢欢喜喜、高高兴兴。我们看，毛主席是如何无微不至地关心人民群众的生活啊！最近毛主席、少奇同志、周总理、朱副主席到各地视察的时候，都是无微不至地关心群众生活的。关心群众生活，注意工作方法，这是我们党的光荣传统。毛主席早在1934年就以此为题目，写了一篇著名的文章。到现在，我们每一次读到这篇文章，都受到一次深刻的教育。
