Xinhua News Agency, 25th: The acquisition volume of several major agricultural products nationwide has steadily increased in mid-November, and the mass movement in agricultural product acquisition is continuing to develop. The current task is to pay attention to quality, processing, and transportation while vigorously doing a good job in acquisition, and to ensure that every link in the acquisition work is accurate and solid.

The acquisition progress of grain, which was originally slow, has been catching up rapidly in the past ten days. The average daily amount entering the warehouse has exceeded 2 billion jin, an increase of more than twice the highest amount in previous years. By the 20th, 55.3% of the annual grain purchase task had been completed. The acquisition of live pigs has also improved significantly, with an average of more than 500,000 pigs being collected daily, and more than 70% of the annual live pig acquisition plan has been completed. The acquisition of economic crops such as cotton, tobacco, and jute continues to rise steadily. As of the 20th, cotton had completed 56.1% of the annual acquisition plan, flue-cured tobacco 46.2%, jute 53.5%, ramie 74.4%, and hemp 51.7%. The cumulative acquisition volume of several major agricultural products in the past ten days, with the exception of kenaf, has exceeded the acquisition volume of the same period last year. However, in terms of the proportion of the annual plan completed, they are still not as good as last year, and some varieties are far behind. Therefore, doing a good job in acquisition is still a major task for current financial and trade work.

Due to the large acquisition volume of agricultural products this year and the highly concentrated acquisition and warehousing time, many agricultural products have not had time to be turned over, dried, and sorted before being put into storage. In some places, the moisture content of grain is high and there are many impurities, and mold and deterioration have begun to occur. Many live pigs do not have enough fat, and the meat yield is low, which affects the supply to export and domestic markets. Cotton has high moisture content and many impurities, making it difficult to store. Relevant departments of the State Council believe that while grasping the acquisition work, all localities must pay attention to quality. Areas that have completed or basically completed the acquisition task should focus on quality. Experience has proven that as long as the leadership attaches importance to it, mobilizes the masses, properly arranges labor, and earnestly solves some specific problems, quantity and quality can be achieved simultaneously. For example, the party and government leading departments in Heilongjiang Province, immediately after the autumn harvest, mobilized the masses to dry and winnow the autumn harvest grain, and at the same time widely taught the communes the technology for inspecting grain quality. Therefore, not only was the grain purchase work in this province completed early this year, but the quality was also good. Guizhou Province's Bijie Prefecture had a lot of rain during the autumn harvest, and the grain moisture content was very high. In order to prevent wet grain from entering the warehouse, the prefecture recently launched a movement to turn over, dry, and bake grain throughout the area. Zhijin County alone mobilized more than 50,000 men, women, and children, organized more than 30,000 ovens and more than 10,000 drying yards to dry and bake grain. Now the moisture content of the grain entering the warehouse in this county basically meets the national standards.

The slow progress in agricultural product processing and the failure to keep up with transportation are two weak links that must be vigorously strengthened at present. In terms of processing, taking cotton as an example, as of the 20th of this month, only 17.5% of the acquired cotton has been processed. Because seed cotton cannot be processed into lint cotton, the supply of textile raw materials has been affected to varying degrees. The reasons for the slow processing progress, in addition to the lack of processing equipment, are mainly the tight short-distance transportation in rural areas, the inadequate supply of seed cotton, the insufficient power required by processing plants, the lack of parts for cotton gins, and the fact that some processing plants have not done a good job in preparation. The method to solve the problem of preliminary processing of agricultural products, in addition to adding some equipment as much as possible, is mainly to mobilize the masses to make full use of the existing equipment, give full play to the potential of the existing equipment, and solve the problems of power, labor, and machine parts locally.

In terms of transportation, it is necessary to vigorously do a good job in organizing short-distance transportation and quickly transport the acquired agricultural products to processing plants and along transportation lines. This is a critical problem that urgently needs to be solved in the current agricultural product acquisition work. The experience of some areas has proven that as long as party and government at all levels strengthen the leadership of rural transportation work, mobilize the masses to earnestly tap various transportation potentials, and organize and arrange them reasonably, rural transportation work can be done well. Xiaofeng County (mountainous area) in Zhejiang Province adopted ten major measures to solve short-distance transportation, namely, using bamboo rafts to transport materials, using the commune's hand carts to return empty to transport materials, vigorously developing forest roads, waterways, cableways (ropes), and slides (bamboo rails) to improve transportation efficiency, and using the method of "ants moving Mount Tai" to mobilize government agencies, schools, organizations, and residents to participate in transportation. From the beginning of November to November 15, a total of more than 1,700 tons of bamboo, wood, firewood, and charcoal were transported out, and the goods transported in accounted for 76.5% of the amount to be transferred in the fourth quarter. In Huojia County, Henan Province, the county party secretary took the lead and organized more than 58,000 people and more than 3,000 vehicles of various sizes. On the 17th, they transported 18 million jin of cotton to factories in one night.

According to a recent inspection by relevant departments of the central government, the national agricultural product acquisition work in the previous stage achieved tremendous results, but there are still some problems in the work that must be paid attention to. For example, some places did not perform the necessary procedures such as inspection, weighing, and warehousing in the acquisition work, and adopted some simple and inappropriate methods, such as "estimating acquisition in the field," "estimating acquisition in the warehouse," "warehousing in the field," and "warehousing on the table," resulting in discrepancies between goods and accounts and the acquisition figures not being accurate. Due to the large quantity, short time, and rapid momentum of agricultural product acquisition this year, it is difficult to completely avoid this phenomenon in the early stages of the movement, and it is understandable. However, these problems must be solved in a timely and serious manner. Recently, the leading departments in many areas have begun to pay attention to these problems. For example, Hubei, Liaoning, Shandong, and other provinces have organized inspection groups (or teams) to conduct in-depth inspections of the acquisition of agricultural products. The central commercial departments have also begun to inspect the acquisition of agricultural products, requiring all localities to clarify accounts, complete procedures, be realistic and verify figures, strive to avoid exaggeration and unrealistic styles, and build every link of agricultural product acquisition work on a solid and reliable basis.

### 收购要踏实　重量又重质  农产品收购量稳步上升，当前要注意抓质量抓加工抓调运

    收购要踏实　重量又重质
    农产品收购量稳步上升，当前要注意抓质量抓加工抓调运
    新华社25日讯　11月中旬全国几种主要农产品的收购量稳步上升，农产品收购方面的群众运动正在继续发展。当前的任务是要在大力做好收购工作的同时，注意抓质量、抓加工、抓调运，并且使收购工作中的每个环节都做到准确踏实。
    原来收购进度较迟缓的粮食，这一旬急起直追，每天平均入库量已超过二十亿斤，比历年最高入库量增加两倍多；到20日，全年粮食征购任务已完成55.3％。生猪收购情况也显著好转，每天平均收猪五十多万头，全年生猪收购计划已完成70％以上。棉、烟、麻等经济作物继续稳步上升，截至20日，棉花完成年度收购计划56.1％，烤烟完成46.2％，黄麻完成53.5％，苎麻完成74.4％，大麻完成51.7％。一旬来几种主要农产品的收购累计数，除了黄洋麻以外，都已超过去年同期的收购量；但是就完成年计划的比例来看，都还赶不上去年，个别品种还差得很远。因此，做好收购工作仍然是当前财贸工作的一项重大任务。
    由于今年农产品的收购量大，收购和入库的时间又十分集中，不少农产品在入库前没有来得及翻晒和整理，有的地方粮食水分高、杂质多，开始发生霉坏变质现象；不少生猪膘肥不够，出肉率低，影响出口和国内市场的供应；棉花水分大、杂质多，不易保管。国务院有关部门认为，目前各地在抓收购工作的同时，必须注意质量，已经完成或基本完成收购任务的地区，更应该突出地抓质量。经验证明，只要领导重视，发动群众，妥善安排劳动力，并且认真地解决一些具体问题，数量和质量是可以同时搞好的。例如黑龙江省党政领导部门在秋收后紧接着就发动群众，把秋收的粮食晒干扬净，同时普遍对公社传授了检验粮食质量的技术，因此这个省今年的粮食征购工作不但提早完成，而且质量也好。贵州省毕节专区秋收时节多雨，粮食水分很大。这个专区为了不让湿粮入仓，最近在全区开展了一个翻晒烘烤粮食的运动，仅织金县就发动了男女老少五万多人，组织了三万多个烘炉、一万多个晒场烘晒粮食，现在这个县入库粮食的水分都基本上符合国家规定的标准。
    农产品加工进度迟缓，调运工作赶不上，是当前必须大力加强的两个薄弱环节。在加工方面，以棉花为例，截至本月20日，已加工的棉花只占收购量的17.5％，由于籽棉不能加工成皮棉，已经在不同程度上影响到纺织原料的供应。加工进度不快的原因，除去加工设备不足以外，主要是农村短途运输紧张，籽棉供应不上，加工厂所需要的动力不足，轧花机的零件缺乏，以及有些地方加工厂的准备工作做得不好等等。解决农产品初步加工问题的方法，除了尽可能地增添一部分设备以外，主要是发动群众充分利用已有的设备，发挥现有设备的潜力，就地解决动力、劳动力和机器零件等问题。
    在调运方面，必须大力做好短途运输的组织工作，把收购到的农产品迅速地调运到加工厂和交通沿线，这是当前农产品收购工作中的一个迫切需要解决的关键问题。部分地区的经验证明，只要各级党政加强对农村运输工作的领导，发动群众认真挖掘各种运输潜力，并且加以合理地组织安排，农村运输工作是可以做好的。浙江省孝丰县（山区）在解决短途运输上采取了十大措施，即利用竹筏运输物资，利用公社的手车回空运输物资，大搞林道、河道、索道（绳索）、滑道（竹轨）提高运输效率，用“蚂蚁搬泰山”的办法发动机关、学校、团体和居民参加运输等等，从11月初到11月15日，共运出竹木、柴炭一千七百多吨，运进的百货占第四季度应调入数的76.5％。河南省获嘉县由县委书记挂帅，组织五万八千多人，大小车三千多辆，17日一夜就向工厂运送棉花一千八百万斤。
    最近据中央有关部门的检查，前一阶段全国农产品的收购工作成绩十分巨大，但是在工作中还存在一些问题，必须引起注意。譬如有的地方在收购工作中没有履行验级、过秤、入库等必要的手续，采取了一些简单的、不适当的做法，如“估场收购”、“估仓收购”、“田间入库”、“桌面入库”等等，以致出现货账不符和收购数字不够确实的现象。由于今年农产品收购的数量大、时间短、来势猛，运动初期发生这种现象是难于完全避免的，也是可以理解的。但是这些问题必须及时地、认真地加以解决，最近不少地区的领导部门已开始注意这些问题，如湖北、辽宁、山东等省已经组织检查团（或组）深入检查农产品的收购情况；中央各商业部门也开始对农产品的收购工作进行检查，要求各地弄清账目、办清手续，实事求是、核实数字，力戒虚夸和不踏实的作风，把农产品收购工作的每一个环节都建立在确实可靠的基础上。（附图片）
