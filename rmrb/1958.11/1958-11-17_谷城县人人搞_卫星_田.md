Gucheng County: Everyone is Creating "Satellite" Fields

(Reported by this newspaper) Gucheng County, Hubei Province, which plans to achieve a wheat yield of 3,000 jin per mu next year, has launched a mass movement of large-scale "satellite" field cultivation, led by cadres and involving everyone in experimentation. The county's 10,756 cadres at the level of small team leader and above have established a total of 21,103 mu of "satellite" fields. Influenced by the leadership of the cadres, 40,931 commune members across the county have also signed up to participate in the "satellite" field movement, establishing a total of 59,017 mu of "satellite" experimental fields. In addition, cadres and the masses have jointly established 5,282 experimental paddy fields, totaling 92,230 mu. The "satellite" fields and "satellite" paddy fields established by cadres and commune members across the county account for 48% of this year's wheat planting area of 360,000 mu.

The establishment of large-scale "satellite" experimental paddy fields is a revolutionary and important measure for increasing agricultural production. When launching this movement, the masses' understanding of experimental fields was not unified. Some believed that engaging in experimental fields would "enrich small plots of land but burden large areas." Others thought, "It's alright to do a few mu, but how can we manage if we do it like this? There's no fertilizer, and we can't handle the labor!" To solve these ideological problems, the Party committees at all levels in Gucheng County specially organized the masses to carry out ideological debates on "Why should we engage in experimental fields?" and "Can we engage in experiments?" Through the debates, everyone realized the benefits of engaging in experimental fields and found ways to overcome difficulties.

In order to promote the in-depth, widespread, and comprehensive development of the "satellite" field movement, various places in Gucheng have also launched experimental field competition movements.

### 谷城县人人搞“卫星”田

    谷城县人人搞“卫星”田
    本报讯　计划明年小麦亩产三千斤的湖北省谷城县开展了一个干部带头，人人搞试验的群众性的大面积“卫星”田运动。全县小队长以上的干部一万零七百五十六人共建立了“卫星”田二万一千一百零三亩。在干部带头的影响下，全县有四万零九百三十一个社员也都纷纷报名投入了“卫星”田运动，共建立了“卫星”试验田五万九千零十七亩；另外干部和群众合伙建立的试验畈五千二百八十二个，九万二千二百三十亩。全县干部和社员建立的“卫星”田和“卫星”畈就占今年种麦面积三十六万亩的48％。
    大面积“卫星”试验畈的建立，是农业增产上一项革命性的重要措施。在开展这一运动时，群众对试验田的认识很不统一，有的认为搞试验田是“肥了小块田，苦了大面积”；另一种人认为“搞个几亩那还行，都像这样搞那受得起呢？肥料没得，劳力那忙得过来呀！”为了解决这些思想问题，谷城县各级党委专门组织群众开展了“为什么要搞试验田”“能不能搞试验”的思想大辩论。通过辩论，大家都认识到了搞试验田的好处和找到了克服困难的办法。
    为了促进“卫星”田运动的深入广泛全面开展，谷城各地还开展了试验田竞赛运动。
