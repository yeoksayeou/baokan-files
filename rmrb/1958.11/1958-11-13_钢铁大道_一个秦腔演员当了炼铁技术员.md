    Steel Road
    ——A Qinqiang Opera Actor Becomes a Steelmaking Technician
    Lei Jia
    The man standing before me was once a Qinqiang opera actor. Now he has left the stage and is a technician at a steelmaking plant. The county party secretary calls him a good cadre. His name is Chen Jialu.
    More than ten years ago, he was the head of the amateur theater troupe in Shandan County, Gansu Province. After the troupe expanded, he became the head of the stage affairs section. He was the one and only female impersonator in the county. Only when the second generation he trained could perform on stage did he switch to playing young male roles and bearded old men.
    If someone asked him, how could he leave? At first, he smiled shyly, but later he laughed unrestrainedly, as if he himself was surprised at how he came to the steel front. He recalled:
    “That's right! When the theater troupe's party secretary heard that I was being transferred, he spread out his hands and said, ‘If you leave, how are we going to put on these plays?’ That was the theater troupe's party secretary's words. The day before, the county party secretary said to me like this: ‘I say, when you go to perform at the blast furnace, you have to sing so that the whole stage is filled with sparks of iron!’”
    Digging to the root, he himself revealed the reason for the transfer. It turned out that he was not only a Qinqiang opera actor but also a coppersmith. He performed opera in the county town at night and made copperware during the day. He could make copper ladles, mend iron pots, and everything else. Therefore, he had some knowledge of the color of fire, and he could tell whether iron could be produced by looking at the mouth of the furnace.
    That day, the people from the theater troupe were planting sandbreak forests twenty miles away when a bicycle came bumping along, delivering a transfer order to Chen Jialu. Chen Jialu understood transfer orders, just like receiving a command arrow on the stage. He immediately went to the city with the person on the bicycle. It was snowing, and his cotton shoes were frozen stiff and clacked with each step, the soles were also falling off. With great difficulty, he arrived at his doorstep, only to find that his wife was not at home, and a lock was hanging on the door. Opera scripts love to drop the ball in these places, but unexpectedly, life would also encounter them. He had to climb in through the window to pack his luggage. Just as he finished packing, his wife came home. His wife asked as soon as they met: “Where are you going?” Chen Jialu replied: “Going to learn steelmaking.” He put his luggage on his back and was about to leave when his wife asked again: “What, you didn’t say anything before?” He impatiently replied: “How can you not understand? It wasn’t decided before! This is the task of steelmaking, the county committee’s decision.” His wife ignored his words and walked around the stove, saying: “If you’re going, you have to eat before you go.” Chen Jialu felt a fire in his heart, thinking, “Don’t act with me anymore!” So he blurted out: “How can I have time? It’s nine o'clock now, the train is at twelve, and I still have to go to the county committee to see if there are any instructions?” Although he said so, his legs couldn't help but bend. He put down his luggage and pretended to look around, then said: “Really, I don’t think I’ve forgotten anything? You keep standing there asking me to eat? Sit down first, eat when you have time.” He picked up his things again, and his wife sat on the ground pulling the bellows. The situation eased, and his wife then began to complain: “I said, you’re an actor, how can you go to make steel?” Chen Jialu suppressed her, saying: “The Party assigned it!” His wife pushed the bellows hard! “If you're afraid to say it, I'll go. An actor goes on stage and sings, what can he do making steel?” “Alas! Isn’t it just going to learn first!” Chen Jialu thought this was a play he had never sung before, and he was afraid of forgetting the lines and being booed, so he hurriedly put his luggage on his back and ran out.
    Chen Jialu and Liu Kangping went to Shanxi to learn. They first arrived in Taiyuan, saying it was in Gaoping, and when they arrived in Gaoping, they said it was in Macun. There were still sixty miles from Gaoping to Macun. At that time, it was dark, and they were not familiar with the road. Liu Kangping said: “Let’s wait for the bus tomorrow!” Chen Jialu thought for a while and disagreed, saying: “Why wait? It’s good to walk at night. If you get tired, I’ll sing you a section, andante, adagio, whatever you choose; Flame Colt, Execution at the辕门 , anything.” The people of Gansu are all Qinqiang opera fans, and Liu Kangping readily agreed. But Chen Jialu stuck out his tongue, because it was the first time he had used opera to mobilize people.
    On the road, Chen Jialu cleared his throat and sang:
    “The three emperors and five emperors of the past, the ages are long,
    Speaking of Tang Yao and Yu Shun, with great generosity,
    Jiang Ziya rides in a carriage, King Wen pulls the rope,
      …………!　…………!”
    With this singing, Chen Jialu first became discouraged and couldn't help but think. What does his current life have in common with these lyrics? Seeing that he was about to arrive at Macun, let the long-ago life be left behind!
    In Macun, they watched for five days and learned it. Hearing that there were indigenous blast furnaces in Jincheng, they went again.
    This is a sand casting factory with hot blast iron-smelting furnaces, and there is a lot to learn. Chen Jialu specialized in studying the structure of the furnace. He suggested buying two pens, one red and one blue. Liu Kangping said: “One pen is not enough, why buy two?” Chen Jialu explained: “You don’t understand, use the red pen to represent the refractory bricks, and the blue pen to represent the blue bricks. If you don’t draw like this, it won’t be clear!” When buying pens, Chen Jialu also bought a triangle ruler. But this ruler looked good but was not easy to use, it was useless for short things, and could not measure long things. Chen Jialu clamored to buy a steel ruler again. At this time, there was not much money left, and Liu Kangping said: “What should we do?” Chen Jialu came up with an idea and said: “There is not much money, don’t worry, you go back first and I’ll stay. You take the drawings back, they will be useful when you get back.”
    Chen Jialu stayed alone. After a few days, he and the others added materials, and suddenly the bottom was blocked, and the furnace had to be tapped. The construction engineer was present, and many people came to study. Chen Jialu took the lead, picked up the steel drill and hit the furnace. Others applauded when they saw that he was not afraid of the fire. Chen Jialu was rough but careful, and took the time to measure the furnace body with a steel ruler. When he came out, someone poured water on his head, and at the same time, he heard the engineer next to him shouting loudly: “Who added the materials just now? How did you add them?” This reminded Chen Jialu. He recalled and indeed, there was no mistake, and he hurried to answer: “No need to ask, the mistake is in the disordered order of adding materials...” Chen Jialu said everything from beginning to end, and the engineer walked over and patted him on the shoulder and said: “You are also here to study! I haven't seen you before. You have the ability, you have learned it! What you just said is right...”
    When Chen Jialu returned to Shandan, two indigenous blast furnaces had been built according to the drawings he brought back. However, due to the different coke, the phenomenon of hanging charge and bottom blockage occurred. The task of steelmaking was urgent, and the county party committee issued instructions to start with indigenous methods, so a large number of indigenous furnaces were built.
    Chen Jialu led the construction of these indigenous furnaces, but the first three furnaces did not produce iron. At this time, thousands of eyes were staring at Chen Jialu alone. Some people said: “It’s a pity you went to study, don’t try to handle broken porcelain without diamond cutters!” The leader supported him, saying to him: “Do you know about six ○ six? It can also cure another disease now, it will be very useful for you, I’m just afraid you’ll be discouraged!”
    That night, Chen Jialu sat alone in the house, feeling depressed. A strong wind was blowing outside, and the small hole in the window was facing the oil lamp on the table, blowing it out all at once. Chen Jialu neither moved nor turned on the light. He wondered what was wrong with the indigenous furnace. After a while, his wife turned on the light for him, but it was soon blown out by the wind again. This time, he got up and turned on the light himself, and hurriedly blocked the window hole with his hand. The flame swayed for a while, but did not go out. He suddenly took his hand away, and it did not go out either. But the wind was blowing even harder outside, why was this? Looking more closely, he found that the window hole was torn bigger. Although the wind was strong, it had no power…
    The next day, he reformed the air duct according to this principle and added an air-making platform to make the wind directly hit the bottom of the furnace, and iron was produced all at once.
    His wife now works in the same factory as him. She sees that his eyes are red and he is getting thinner day by day. He has really become a busy man, every indigenous blast furnace needs him, and everyone calls out "Old Chen." His wife wishes she could replace him, so he could sleep for a while. Once his wife asked him:
    “The iron-smelting furnace also needs to be dismantled and the bricks repaired, you're not made of iron, are you?”
    “What did you say?” Chen Jialu asked in surprise. After a while, he replied tenderly: “You still don’t understand! Those people in the past, I mean those old artists, saying they are old artists, they are younger than me, saying they are not old artists! Their minds are full of old things. That road is getting narrower and narrower. Now, although my eyes are red, my heart is shining brightly. If I were to sing opera again, I would sing: ‘With steel, there are machines; with machines, there is socialism!’”
    His wife said: “What kind of tune is this?”
    “No, this is the opening line!”

    钢铁大道
    ——一个秦腔演员当了炼铁技术员
    雷加
    站在我面前的这个人，从前是一名秦腔演员，现在他离开了舞台，在炼铁厂是个技术员，县委书记称他是好干部。他的名字叫陈家禄。
    十多年前，他就是甘肃省山丹县业余剧团团长，剧团扩大之后，他又担任剧务股长。他是本县唯一无二的旦角，从他培养的第二代能够上台演唱起，他才改演小生和胡子生。
    如果有人问他，这怎么能离得开？起初他笑得羞涩，后来就毫无拘束地大笑起来，仿佛他也奇怪怎么来到钢铁战线的。他回忆着说：
    “说的是嘛！剧团支书听说我要调动，他摊开两手说：‘你一走，这几本戏咋往外拿呀？’这是剧团支书的话；前一天县委书记可是这样对我说的：‘我说，你到高炉去演出，要唱得满台放出铁花来！’”
    挖根寻底，他自己说出了调动的原由，原来他不但是个秦腔演员，还是一个铜匠。他在县城黑夜唱戏，白天就做铜活。打铜杓、补铁锅，样样来得。因此他对火色有些研究，一望炉口，就知道能不能出铁。
    那天，剧团的人们都在二十里外种植防沙林带，一辆自行车颠颠簸簸跑来，交给陈家禄一张调令。陈家禄是懂得调令的，就像在戏台接到一支令箭那样，当时就和骑车的人一起进城了。天正下雪，他的棉鞋冻得卡卡的响，底子也蹬掉了。好歹来到家门口，偏偏老婆不在家，门上挂了一把铁锁。戏本上爱在这些地方掉花枪，想不到生活里也会遇到。他不得不从窗户爬进去，收拾自己的行李。刚拾掇完了，老婆也回来了。老婆见面就问：“哪里去？”陈家禄答：“学炼铁去。”他背上行李要走，老婆又问：“咋，过去没说？”他不耐烦地答：“你怎么不明白？过去还没决定嘛！这是钢铁的任务，县委的决定”。老婆不理会他的话，在锅台边转了个圈说：“要走，也得吃上再走。”陈家禄心里一团火，想：“你别再跟我演戏啦！”于是冲口说道：“哪来得及，现在九点，十二点的车，我还得到县委去，看有什么吩咐？”他虽这么说，两条腿不由得打了弯。他放下行李，装模作样地四周瞅了瞅，才道：“真的，我看还忘了什么没有？叫我吃饭，你净站着干什么？先做下，有空就吃。”他又拾揽一遍东西，老婆坐在地下拉风箱，情势缓和了，老婆这才一阵阵数说起来：“我说演员嘛，怎好炼铁去？”陈家禄压住她的口风，顶上去说：“党分配嘛！”老婆狠狠把风箱推进去！“你怕说，我去。一个演员上台就唱，炼铁能弄个什么名堂。”“唉！这不是先去学习嘛！”陈家禄心想这是一本他没唱过的戏，很怕忘了台词，叫人喝一声倒采，所以就急急忙忙背上行李跑出来了。
    陈家禄和刘康平两个人，到山西取经去。他们先到了太原，说在高平，到了高平，又说在马村。由高平到马村还有六十里路，当时天黑路又不熟，刘康平说：“咱等第二天的汽车吧！”陈家禄想了一想，不同意，他说：“为什么要等呢？晚上正好走路，走累了我给你唱上一段，二六、慢板，尽你挑；火焰驹，辕门斩子，什么都行。”甘肃人都是秦腔迷，刘康平一口答应了。可是陈家禄倒吐了舌头，因为他用戏来做动员工作，这还是头一遭呢？
    在路上，陈家禄亮亮嗓子，就唱出了：
    “前三皇后五帝，年代久远，
    说汤尧并禹舜，腹大量宽，
    姜子牙坐车辇，文王扯纤，
      …………！　…………！”
    这一唱，陈家禄先泄了气，不免思前想后。他现在的生活和这戏词，有什么一样？眼看就到马村了，火光在前，让那些年代久远的生活一起留在后面吧！
    在马村，他们看了五天就学会了。听说晋城有土高炉，于是又去了。
    这里是一个翻砂厂，有热风炼铁炉，要学的东西很多。陈家禄专门琢磨炉子构造。他提议买两管笔，一管红的，一管蓝的。刘康平说：“一管还不够，买两管干什么？”陈家禄解释道：“你不明白，用红笔代表耐火砖，蓝笔代表青砖，不这样画不清楚呵！”买笔的时候，陈家禄又买了一个三角尺。可是这尺好看不好用，短东西用不着，长东西量不了。陈家禄又吵着买钢尺。这时钱不多了，刘康平说：“这咋办呀？”陈家禄又摆出点子说道：“钱不多，不怕，你先回去我留下，你带上图样，回去正有用处。”
    陈家禄一个人留下来，过了几天，他和大伙一块加料，忽然结了底，必需掏炉。建炉的工程师在场，来学习的人也不少，陈家禄领头拿起钢钎就打炉。别人看他不怕火，拍手叫好。陈家禄粗中有细，抽空拿出钢尺量了量炉体。他走出来时，有人用水浇在他的头上，同时听见那个工程师在旁高声嚷道：“刚才是谁加的料？怎么加的？”这下提醒了陈家禄，他一回想，果然不错，忙着答道：“不用问，错处就出在加料次序乱啦……”陈家禄原原本本说了一气，工程师走来拍着他的肩头说：“你也是来学习的吧！我还没见过你。有本事，你学成啦！刚才说的正对……”
    陈家禄回到山丹，两座土高炉已按照带回的图样建成了。但因焦炭不同，发生了悬料结底现象。钢铁任务紧急，县委发出土法上马的指示，于是又建起了大批土炉。
    陈家禄领导建设这些土炉，头三炉也没有炼出铁来。这时，千百只眼睛瞅着陈家禄一个人。有人说：“还亏你学习一趟，没有金刚钻，别揽破瓷器呵！”领导可给他撑腰，对他说：“你知道六○六吗？它现在还治另外一种病，对你很有用处，就怕你泄气呀！” 
    这天晚上，陈家禄一个人坐在房子里发闷。外面刮着大风，窗上那个小孔正对着桌上那盏油灯，一下子吹灭了。陈家禄既不动颤，也不点灯。心想土炉毛病倒底在哪里呢？隔了一阵，他老婆给他把灯点上了，不久又被风吹灭了。这次，他爬起来自己点上灯，又忙着用手挡住窗孔，看那灯苗晃了一阵，却没有灭。他突地把手拿开，也没有灭。可是外面风刮得更大了，这是为什么呢？再仔细一看，原来窗孔撕大了，虽然风大，却没了力量……
    第二天，他根据这个道理改造了风道，又加上一个造风台，使风直射炉底，一下子就炼出铁来。
    他的老婆现在和他在一个厂子工作。她看他眼睛红了，一天天瘦了。他真的变成忙人了，每个土高炉都要他，到处喊老陈。他老婆恨不能代替他，叫他睡上一阵才好。有一次他老婆对他问道：
    “炼铁炉还有个拆炉补砖，你又不是个铁打的？”
    “你说什么？”陈家禄吃惊地问。隔了一阵，他才温情细语地答道：“你还不懂呵！从前那些人，我说的是那班子老艺人，说他是老艺人，年纪比我还轻，说不是老艺人吧！满脑子都是旧东西。那条路，越走越窄。现在，眼熬红了，我心里可照得亮堂了。要再唱戏，我就唱：“有了钢，才有机器；有了机器，才有社会主义！”
    老婆说：“你这是哪国板眼？”
    “不，这是开场白！”
