    In the Dong Village of Shaoxi
    By our correspondents, Li Jinting and Zhu Shaochao
    A miracle has occurred in the production of pigs in Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County this year, quadrupling that of last year, with an average of more than 22 pigs per household by the end of the year. At a time when the national meat supply is not so plentiful, the news is truly exciting. We decided to go to this county to study why it has developed so quickly and what experiences can be used as a reference for other places.
    Going to Shaoxi Dong Village
    Xinhuang is a large mountainous area in the westernmost part of Hunan Province, bordering Yuping in Guizhou, and is a major transportation route to Guiyang. In late October, we took a long-distance bus from Changsha and traveled west along the Xiangqian Highway. When we entered the county's border on the third day, we kept encountering trucks loaded with fat pigs, heading towards the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway line. It was the season for harvesting late rice, and the rice ears, like thick velvet blankets, covered the rice fields, filled with a scene of abundant harvest. A young man on the bus told us: Pig raising is really a good deal, with lots of meat and high income. One pig can accumulate 50 dan of refined fertilizer a year. He also told us that the county has more than 200,000 mu of fields and land, but this year it raised 750,000 pigs, an average of three pigs per mu of fields and land to supply fertilizer. No wonder there was a good harvest of mid-season rice, and the late rice is also bountiful.
    At the Xinhuang County Committee, we asked the responsible comrades of the county committee to talk about the experience of the great development of pig production this year. They modestly said: There is no experience. It's just that last year, Shaoxi Agricultural Cooperative in our county raised an average of 22.9 pigs per household, which was rated as the first in the country by the Central Ministry of Agriculture and was reported in the newspaper. This incident greatly inspired many cooperatives here. They believed that the conditions of Shaoxi Cooperative were similar to those of more than 300 other cooperatives. If this cooperative could develop greatly, why couldn't other cooperatives develop greatly? Shaoxi Cooperative has become the pig-raising red flag here, and many cooperatives that did not raise pigs in the past have started raising pigs, learning from the example of Shaoxi.
    Now, Shaoxi is a brigade of the Fulou People's Commune. It will have an average of 70 pigs per household by the end of the year, and it is likely to still be a red flag for developing pig production in the country. To study the experience of this county in developing pig production at high speed, it is better to dissect this Shaoxi sparrow. Therefore, we decided to go to Shaoxi to learn from their experience.
    Shaoxi is located south of the county seat, 105 li away from the county seat. It is a beautiful small mountain village surrounded by green hills. A clear stream flows through the center of the village, driving the water turbine of a processing plant, making a roaring sound. The three-story houses built by the Dong people's "skilled craftsmen" without a single iron nail, appear particularly exquisite among the pine trees. Chrysanthemums, peonies, and hibiscus are planted in front of and behind the houses. People generally think that with so many pigs, environmental sanitation must be poor and dirty. But here, you can't see at all that it is a place where an average of more than 70 pigs are raised per household. "The pigs are all kept in the livestock farms," said Wu Xianwei, the deputy captain of this brigade who led us on the tour.
    Self-breeding, Self-raising, Self-planting Feed
    Two or three li away from the village, we entered a mountain valley. Here is the construction site for the 50,000-pig pigsty. Rows of whitewashed wooden houses are surrounded by large areas of vegetable fields, and many Dong girls are picking vegetables. Wu Xianwei said with a smile: The houses are for the livestock farms, and the green vegetables are all feed. Shaoxi has never used a single grain of rice to raise pigs. Now, they use intercropping, strip cropping, mixed cropping, and other evergreen methods to plant green fodder, and they no longer pick wild vegetables. In addition, they plant sweet potatoes, corn, and radishes as concentrated feed. After communization, everyone handed over their private plots to the cooperative, and the livestock farm organized professional teams to cultivate them. Currently, 230 mu have been planted, with an average yield of about 200,000 jin per mu, and the highest yield is more than 460,000 jin per mu. The feed produced by one mu of land can feed 20-40 pigs a year.
    The first livestock farm we entered was dedicated to raising sows. The yard was very spacious, swept very clean, and there was no smell or sound of pigs. The pigsties are still under construction. More than 200 pigs are currently being raised, and thousands can be raised in the future. The Dong people attach great importance to raising sows. They call the sow farm the "heavy industry" factory for raising pigs. The sows sent to the farm have been strictly selected, and each one is healthy, and the piglets born are all "little fat ones." They have truly achieved self-breeding, self-raising, and self-improvement.
    Next, we visited several livestock farms that specialize in feeding fattening pigs, feeding framework pigs, and feeding piglets. Each livestock farm is like a workshop in a factory. The farm is cleaned four times a day, and the pens are disinfected one to three times a week. It is said that even in summer there is no odor here. Walking into the "pig canteen," some of the feeders are busy cutting vegetables, and others are boiling swill. They also opened a "small stove meal" for the piglets. The piglets eat soft food, the fattening pigs eat dry food, and the framework pigs and sows require the same, neither dry nor soupy. Each livestock farm has a special person to feed the pigs. She (he) can master the tastes and tempers of various pigs and feed the pigs very fat.
    A Large Number of Women Pig-Raising Experts
    We stayed in Shaoxi for four days and learned a lot. We felt that they had made outstanding achievements in pig sources and feed. This is one of the important reasons for their high-speed development of pig production in the past two years, and it is worthy of learning by other regions. However, what impressed us the most was that the local area had cultivated a large number of pig-raising activists, especially a group of middle-aged and older women who could raise sows. They are proficient in everything from selecting breeds, mating, and treating diseases. After the sow gives birth, they will feed each sow rice wine for a month to ensure that she is strong and has enough milk. Xu Yinxiu, 52, is one of these experts in raising sows. Her experience can well explain why Dong women are particularly good at raising sows, this "problem."
    When we went to her house, she was feeding the pigs. After counting, there were as many as 20 pigs. This year, she fed three sows and has already had 30 piglets. After communization, she handed over all her pigs to the commune at a discounted price, and she herself became a full-time feeder. When the livestock farm is built, her whole family will move there to settle down and specialize in raising sows. She told us that since she got married at the age of seventeen, due to poverty, she had to give piglets to rich peasants every year. Decades of hard work have trained her to become a "specialist" in raising sows. There are dozens of women like her in Shaoxi, most of whom have entered the livestock farm as professional feeders. This is a valuable force for the local development of pig production and is the backbone "worker" for establishing a pig-raising "heavy industry" factory.
    In the first half of this year, Shaoxi successively established four small livestock farms and trained 106 feeders, 100 of whom are women. This group of young people is working hard to learn from experienced pig-raising experts like Xu Yinxiu. After more than half a year of training, more than 60 people have learned the work of feeders, inseminators, and veterinarians, truly achieving "three-in-one." In our conversations with many of them, we can feel the ambition of this group of young people at any time. Many people regard the work of a feeder as their lifelong career.
    Steadfast Female Feeder
    Jiang Juzhao was one of the earliest feeders in the livestock farm and is also a young person who has adhered to this work from beginning to end. She looks less than 20 years old. Now she is a people's representative of Shaoxi Township. In December last year, the construction of the livestock farm began, and the Party branch called on young people to become feeders and vigorously develop the collective pig-raising cause. At that time, most young people thought that pig-raising was dirty and tiring and had no future, and others laughed at them. Some elderly people also said: Feeding pigs means getting up early and working late, and the work is too tiring. But Jiang Juzhao was the first to respond to the Party branch's call and went to the first livestock farm with two young women to be feeders. They went to pick firewood and vegetables two or three li away every day. The work was really intense. In a few days, the two young women went home and quit, leaving her alone to feed 24 sows and 16 piglets. Later, four more feeders came, but none of them lasted for three days before returning. At this time, her family also said to Jiang Juzhao: "This one comes, that one runs, you'd better come back too." She was not moved by her family. She still carried water, chopped firewood, picked vegetables, and fed the pigs as usual, and also took care of a sow to give birth to eight piglets safely. Her exemplary behavior moved many young people. Under the education of the Party and Youth League branches, the number of people becoming feeders slowly increased. Some elderly people also stopped talking. This year, the local area promoted advanced mating methods such as double mating, re-mating, blood mating, and artificial estrus for the first time. She was also the first to break the old rule that women cannot mate and would be laughed at, taking the lead in mating sows. She also worked hard to study veterinary medicine and achieved good results. This spring, people in the whole township elected this lovely girl as a people's representative of the township with unlimited respect. (Picture attached)

    在绍溪侗乡
    本报记者　李进挺　朱绍超
    新晃侗族自治县今年生猪生产出现了奇迹，较去年翻了三番，到年底平均每户有猪二十二头多。在全国肉食情况还不是那么宽裕的时候，消息传来实在令人兴奋。我们决定到这个县去，研究一下它为什么发展得这样快，有那些经验可供其他地方参考。
    到绍溪侗乡去
    新晃是湖南省最西边的一个大山区，和贵州玉屏临界，是通往贵阳的交通要道。10月下旬，我们乘长途汽车从长沙出发，沿湘黔公路西行，当我们第三天驶入这个县的县境的时候，就不断碰着满载肥猪的卡车，向京广铁路沿线奔驰而去。这时正是收割晚稻的季节，稻穗像很厚的绒毯，把稻田盖得满满的，充满着一片丰收景象。同车的一位青年对我们说：养猪真算得过账，肉食多，收入大，一头猪一年还能积五十担精肥。他还告诉我们，全县有二十多万亩田、土，可是今年就养了七十五万头猪，平均一亩田、土有三头猪供给肥料。难怪这里中稻刚得到一个好收成，晚稻又丰收了。
    在新晃县委会，我们请县委负责同志谈谈今年生猪大发展的经验。他们谦虚地说：没什么经验，只是去年我县有个绍溪农业社，平均每户养二十二点九头猪，被中央农业部评为全国第一，并且登了报。这件事给我们这里的许多社启发很大，它们认为绍溪社和其他三百多个社的条件差不多，这个社能大发展，为什么其他社不能大发展呢？绍溪社成了这里的养猪红旗，许多过去没有养猪的社，都学绍溪的榜样养起猪来。
    现在，绍溪是扶罗人民公社的一个大队。它年底平均每户就有七十头，很可能还是全国发展生猪生产的一面红旗。要研究这个县高速度地发展生猪生产的经验，就不如解剖绍溪这只麻雀。因此我们决定到绍溪去取经。
    绍溪在县城南面，距县城一百零五里，是一个美丽的小山寨，四面青山环绕。一股清彻的溪流从村寨中央流过，冲动一座加工厂的水轮，发出轰轰的响声。侗族的“能工巧匠”不用一个铁钉修建的三层房子，在苍松丛中，显得特别精致。屋前屋后，栽培着菊花、芍药、芙蓉，一般人总以为养猪多了，环境卫生一定搞不好，脏。可是在这里，却完全看不出是平均每户就要养七十多头猪的地方。“猪都关进了畜牧场”。带领我们参观的，这个大队的副队长吴先维对我们说。
    自繁自养自种饲料
    离开村寨两、三里，走进一个山冲，这里是五万头猪舍的基建工地，一座座粉刷得雪白的木房，被大片、大片的蔬菜地包围着，许多侗族姑娘正在摘菜。吴先维笑着说：房子是畜牧场的，青菜全是饲料，绍溪养猪历来不用一粒稻谷。现在，他们采用间种、套种、混种等四季常青的办法种青饲料，不采野菜了。另外种红薯、包谷、萝卜作为精料。公社化以后，大家都把自留地交给社，由畜牧场组织专业队耕种，目前种了二百三十亩，一般亩产二十万斤左右，最高的亩产四十六万多斤，一亩地生产的饲料，一年能喂二十——四十头猪。
    我们第一个走进的畜牧场是专养母猪的。场院十分宽敞。打扫得很干净，闻不见丝毫臭气，也听不到猪的叫声。猪舍还在陆续兴建中，现在已喂二百多头，将来可收几千头。侗族人非常重视养母猪，他们叫母猪场为“养猪的重工业”工厂。送进场的母猪都经过严格挑选，个个健壮，生下的仔都是“小胖子”。他们真正做到了自繁、自养、自改良。
    接着，我们又参观了专门喂肥猪、喂架子猪、喂仔猪的几个畜牧场。每个畜牧场就像工厂的一个车间，场内一天要打扫四次，一星期要进行一至三次栏内消毒。据说，即便在夏天这里也是没有臭气的。走进“猪食堂”，饲养员们一部分正忙着切菜，另一部分正在煮潲，他们还为仔猪开了“小灶伙食”。小猪吃的要烂、肥猪要干、架子猪和母猪要求一样，不干不汤，每个畜牧场都有专门喂猪的人，她（他）们能掌握各种猪的口胃和脾气，把猪喂得很肥。
    大批妇女养猪能手
    我们在绍溪共住了四天，学到了不少东西。感到他们在猪源和饲料等方面抓得很突出。这是两年来它们高速度地发展生猪生产的重要原因之一，是值得其他地区学习的。但是，使我们感受最深的，还是当地培养出了一大批养猪的积极分子，特别是一批中年以上的会饲养母猪的妇女。她们对选种、配种、治病等样样都会。母猪产仔后，她们要给每头母猪喂一个月甜酒，保证体壮奶足。五十二岁的徐银秀，就是这批饲养母猪能手当中的一个。她的经历很能说明侗族妇女为什么特别会饲养母猪这个“问题”。
    我们到她家去的时候，她正在喂猪，数了一下，足足有二十头。今年，她喂了三头母猪，已下了三十个猪仔。公社化后，她把自己的猪全部折价交给公社，自己也成了专职饲养员了。等畜牧场建好，她就全家搬去安家落户，专门喂养母猪。她告诉我们，自从十七岁出嫁以来，由于家穷，每年都要给富农仔猪，几十年的辛勤劳动，已把她锻炼成为饲养母猪的“专家”了。绍溪像她这样的妇女有几十个，大部分已进畜牧场当了专业饲养员。这是当地发展生猪生产的一支宝贵的力量，是建立养猪“重工业”工厂的骨干“工人”。
    绍溪在今年上半年先后建立了四个小型畜牧场，培养出一百零六个饲养员，其中有一百名是妇女。这批年轻人努力向有经验的养猪专家像徐银秀那样的妇女学习，经过半年多的锻炼，已经有六十多人学会了饲养员、配种员和兽医的工作，真正做到了“三员合一”。我们和她（他）们当中的好些人交谈中，随时都能感触到这批青年的志气，许多人把饲养员这件工作，当作自己终身的事业。
    坚定不移的女饲养员
    姜菊昭是畜牧场里最早的一个饲养员，也是一个自始至终坚持这项工作的青年。她看起来还不到二十岁。现在是绍溪乡的乡人民代表。去年12月开始建立畜牧场，党支部号召青年人去当饲养员，大力发展集体养猪事业。当时一般青年人认为养猪工作又脏又累没有前途，别人也笑话。一些年老人也说：喂猪起早摸黑，工作太累人。可是姜菊昭第一个响应党支部的号召，同两个女青年到第一饲养场当饲养员。她们每天到两、三里路外去挑柴、采菜。工作真是紧张。过不几天，那两个女青年就回家不干了，只剩下她一个人坚持喂二十四头母猪和十六头小猪。后来，又来过四个饲养员，但是，都没坚持到三天就回去了。这时候，家里人也对姜菊昭说：“这个来，那个跑，你还是回来好了。”她没有被家里人说动，一个人照常挑水、打柴、采菜、喂猪，还照顾一头母猪平安地生下八个猪仔。她的模范行为感动了许多年轻人，在党、团支部教育下，当饲养员的人慢慢多起来了。一些老年人也不说话了。今年，当地第一次推行双配、复配、血配和人工催情等先进的配种方法，她又是第一个打破妇女配种，要被人笑话的老常规，带头给母猪配种。她还努力学习兽医，成绩也不错。今年春天，全乡人怀着无限的敬意，把这位可爱的姑娘选上了乡的人民代表。（附图片）
