Editorial: Further Improve the Quality of Agricultural Product Procurement

Recently, the situation regarding agricultural product procurement has been very good. To date, the state's procurement of major agricultural products has largely reached more than half of the annual plan, and some provinces have already completed their annual procurement tasks for major agricultural products ahead of schedule and exceeded their quotas.

This year's agricultural product procurement work has been carried out under conditions of unprecedentedly tight rural labor. The speed of procurement, the mobilization of manpower, and the quantity of procurement are all unprecedented. Many comrades who initially doubted that it would be possible to carry out a concentrated agricultural product procurement drive while vigorously developing steel production have now seen that as long as the work is rationally arranged, the people's communes are relied upon, and the masses are fully mobilized, procurement work that was originally thought to be impossible to arrange can also be completed.

However, we must not be complacent in the face of achievements. While seeing that achievements are the mainstream, we must also clearly see the shortcomings in our work. For example, some areas adopted the practice of not weighing products during the concentrated procurement, only making a rough estimate of the quantity; many areas did not clarify accounts and procedures; and individual places even had the phenomenon of falsely reporting figures. These shortcomings should be given sufficient attention. Of course, we should see that this year's agricultural product procurement work was carried out using mass movement methods, and there was not much experience in this area in the past; moreover, the work was a concentrated effort in a short period of time, scales, warehouses, and transportation and packaging equipment were insufficient, and most of the masses participating in the procurement had not received training in cotton grading, and could not immediately master technical issues such as cotton grading. Therefore, it was inevitable that some shortcomings would arise in the work, and these shortcomings are by no means the mainstream of the work. However, if we do not clearly see these shortcomings and quickly overcome them, then future procurement work cannot make real progress, and the achievements already obtained will not be consolidated. Therefore, at present, in addition to some areas where the procurement progress is slow and the completion of tasks is poor, and where it is still necessary to organize necessary concentrated procurement efforts, other areas where the procurement progress is faster and the completion of tasks is better should further verify the procurement figures. It should be recognized that it is difficult to achieve completely accurate agricultural product procurement figures before procurement, and therefore a certain degree of estimation is unavoidable. However, now that agricultural product procurement is more than half completed, it is necessary and possible to further clarify and refine the procurement figures, and to clarify accounts and complete procedures on the basis of verifying the figures. It should be recognized that whether the figures are accurate and whether the accounts and procedures are clear are directly related to the interests of the state and the people's communes, and must be taken seriously.

Procurement work must be done practically. Not only should we focus on quantity, but also on quality. In the past period, due to the large quantity of agricultural products harvested and the concentrated time frame, there was not enough time to properly dry and sort them. In many areas, the moisture and impurities of the grain procured exceeded the prescribed standards, and some grain and flue-cured tobacco have already experienced heating and mildew, and the cotton grades were also not very clearly divided, affecting rational use. This year's bumper agricultural harvest is the result of the hard work of the vast number of farmers, and we must not allow the fruits of victory to be lost in the procurement process. Therefore, for agricultural products that have already been procured, we must seize the time to sort and dry them before they are put into storage; and we must also pay attention to doing a good job of inspection of agricultural products that have already been put into storage. Now the steel front has put forward the requirement of "good steel and good iron"; in agricultural product procurement, we should also be in the spirit of "good grain and good cotton", ensuring both quantity and quality.

To do a good job of procurement, we must also strengthen some weak links. At present, the weak links in procurement work are insufficient processing and transportation capacity, and there are many difficulties in processing and transporting all the agricultural products collected in a short period of time. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels and relevant leading departments also need to use great efforts to mobilize the masses, tap the potential of processing and transportation equipment, and make reasonable arrangements to give full play to their effectiveness. We must do a good job of processing and transportation in order to ease the tight market supply situation and meet the needs of production, consumption, exports, and other aspects. While focusing on procurement, the work of commodity supply must also keep up closely to meet the needs of the vast number of urban and rural people for production and consumer goods.

In the coming period, the task of agricultural product procurement will still be very arduous. In the previous period, various localities created many good experiences in procurement work. These experiences should be summarized and promoted in a timely and serious manner. Recently, Hubei, Shandong and other places organized a large number of cadres to go deep into the grassroots to inspect and help financial and trade work. This measure is very timely and necessary. We hope that relevant leading departments at all levels will organize such inspection teams to go deep into the grassroots at appropriate times, so that the vast number of cadres and the masses can continue to exert their energy and do a better job of agricultural product procurement in a down-to-earth manner, and achieve greater victories.

### 进一步提高农产品  收购工作的质量

    进一步提高农产品  收购工作的质量
    最近，农产品收购的情况很好。到目前为止，国家收购的主要农产品，绝大部分已经达到全年计划的半数以上，部分省份已经提前超额完成了主要农产品的全年收购任务。
    今年的农产品收购工作是在农村劳动力空前紧张的情况下进行的，收购速度之快，动员人力之多，收购数量之大，都是前所未有的。许多起初怀疑在大搞钢铁的同时能够突击收购农产品的同志，现在他们已经看到，只要对工作作合理的安排，依靠人民公社，把群众充分发动起来，原来认为没有办法安排的收购工作，也是可以完成的。
    但是，我们决不可以在成绩面前沾沾自喜。在看到成绩是主流的同时，也必须清醒地看到工作中缺点的一面。例如，有的地区在突击收购的时候，曾采取不过秤，只大体估计一下数量的做法；不少地区的帐目、手续没有弄清楚；个别地方甚至还有虚报数字的现象。这些缺点，应当引起我们足够的重视。当然，我们应当看到，今年农产品收购工作是用群众运动的方法进行的，过去这方面的经验不多；而且，工作是短时间突击的，磅秤、仓库和运输、包装器材都不够，参加收购的多数群众没有受过棉花验级的训练，不能一下子掌握棉花验级等技术问题，因而在工作中产生了一些缺点，是不可避免的，这些缺点决不是工作的主流。但是，如果我们不清醒地看到这些缺点，并且很快克服，那末，今后的收购工作就不能获得切实的进展，已经获得的成绩也是不巩固的。因此，目前除了一些收购进度较慢，完成任务较差的地方仍要组织必要的突击性的收购外，其他收购进度较快，完成任务较好的地区，就应该进一步核实收购的数字。应该看到，在收购以前要求农产品收购数字做到十分精确，是有困难的，因此，带有一定的估计程度是不可避免的。但是，在目前农产品收购已过半数的情况下，就有必要而且也有条件把收购数字进一步弄清楚、弄精确，并在核实数字的基础上弄清帐目，办清手续。应该认识：数字是否确实，帐目和手续是否清楚，对于国家和人民公社的利益都有直接的关系，必须认真对待。
    收购工作要做得踏实。不仅要抓数量，而且要抓质量。过去一段时间，由于农产品收获数量大，时间集中，来不及很好地翻晒和整理，不少地区收购的粮食水分和杂质超过了规定的标准，有一些粮食和烤烟已经发生发热和霉烂的现象，棉花等级也有一些分得不很清楚，影响了合理使用。今年农业大丰收，广大农民付出了大量的辛勤的劳动，我们决不能使胜利的果实在收购环节上遭受损失。因此，对于已经收购起来的农产品，必须在入库以前抓紧时间进行整理、翻晒；已经入库的农产品也要注意做好检查工作。现在钢铁战线上提出了“钢要好钢，铁要好铁”的要求；在农产品收购上，也应该本着这样的精神，做到“粮要好粮，棉要好棉”，既要保证数量，也要保证质量。
    要把收购工作做好，还必须加强一些薄弱的环节。在目前，收购工作中的薄弱环节是加工和运输力量不足，要在短时期内把所有收起来的农产品加工出来，调运出去，有不少困难。因此，各级党组织和有关的领导部门还需要用很大的力量发动群众，挖掘加工和运输设备的潜力，并加以合理的安排，以充分发挥它们的效能。我们必须把加工和调运工作做好，才能缓和市场供应紧张的局面，满足生产和消费、出口等各方面的需要。在抓收购工作的同时，商品供应工作还必须紧紧跟上去，以满足广大城乡人民对生产和消费资料的需要。
    在今后一个时期内，农产品收购任务还很艰巨。前一段时间各地在收购工作当中创造了不少很好的经验。对这些经验，应当及时地、认真地总结和推广。最近湖北、山东等地组织了大批干部深入基层检查和帮助财贸工作，这种措施很及时，也很必要。我们希望各级有关领导部门都在适当的时候，组织这样的检查团深入基层，使广大干部和群众继续鼓足干劲，踏踏实实地把农产品收购工作做得更好，取得更大的胜利。
