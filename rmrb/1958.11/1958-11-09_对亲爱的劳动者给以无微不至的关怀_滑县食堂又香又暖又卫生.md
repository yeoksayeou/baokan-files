Huaxian County Canteen “Eight Transformations”: Restaurantization, Tableization, Sweet Potato Breadization, Food Diversification, Soup and Vegetable Warm-Vatization, Steamed Bun Warm-Basketization, Self-Flowing Water Pipeization, Stove Great Leap Forwardization.

 Zhengzhou, November 8th (Our Dispatch) The Huaxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Henan Province, conscientiously strengthened its leadership over canteen work, adopting the method of launching "satellites." Within five days, all 2,900-plus public canteens in the county basically achieved the "Eight Transformations": restaurantization, tableization, sweet potato breadization, food diversification, soup and vegetable warm-vatization, steamed bun warm-basketization, self-flowing water pipeization, and stove Great Leap Forwardization.

 Huaxian County has universally established organizations dedicated to leading welfare undertakings from the county and commune levels down to the team level. Secretaries and cadres of Party organizations at all levels have gone deep into the canteens, discovered, through working alongside cooks and dining with peasants, that most canteens, in the face of the increasingly cold weather, not only lacked restaurants, but also lacked even the simplest insulation equipment for the dishes and rice after they came out of the pot. Commune members often could not eat hot meals. In terms of food variety, because sweet potatoes currently occupy a major position in rations, coupled with poor management and regulation, many canteens were cooking sweet potatoes for every meal, which also aroused dissatisfaction among commune members. In addition, in terms of water usage and cooking, due to backward tools and reliance on manual water carrying, one stove and one pot were used to cook rice, which not only wasted manpower, but also often failed to ensure timely meals.

 In order to further consolidate and improve public canteens and satisfy all commune members, the Huaxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after conscientiously summarizing the experiences of advanced canteens, decided on October 28th to launch a mass movement centered on realizing the "Eight Transformations" throughout the county. It also established a system of layered responsibility, with the county committee responsible for the communes, the communes responsible for the brigades, and the production brigade cadres responsible for the canteens, and deeply mobilized the masses. Many local people automatically vacated houses, collected wood or brick blanks, and put forward slogans such as "Engage in production during the day, and launch a surprise attack to build canteens at night." As a result, after five days of concentrated effort, the county's 2,945 public canteens basically realized the "Eight Transformations": (1) Restaurantization: The county has now built 1,200 new restaurants, which can accommodate 240,000 people. In addition, 21,000 rooms have been vacated from near the canteens, accommodating more than 315,000 people, accounting for over 95% of the county's total population. Furthermore, 80 restaurants capable of accommodating 30,000 people are currently under construction. (2) Tableization: The county has collected old dining tables through commune members' voluntary contributions, and has also made some new ones. There are now 72,500 tables, generally with six to eight people per table, and the number of commune members dining at tables has reached over 80% of the county's population. (3) 85% of the canteens have achieved sweet potato breadization. The method is to mix sweet potatoes with a small amount of flour and bake them, making them delicious and popular with the masses. (4) Food Diversification: At most, it is possible to avoid repetition of meals for a month. Generally, it is possible to avoid repetition of meals for seven to ten days. At the very least, it is possible to avoid repetition of meals for three days. (5) Soup and Vegetable Warm-Vatization: This is mostly made by wrapping quilts or wheat straw around earthenware vats. Some are built on the ground and can be heated by burning fire underneath. The county now has 9,450 warm vats, with an average of one warm vat for every 45 people, enabling 70% of commune members to eat hot meals that burn their mouths. (6) Steamed Bun Warm-Basketization (made of rice straw): The county now has 9,600 warm baskets, with one warm basket for every 45 people. The rest are being rushed to make, ensuring that everyone can eat hot steamed buns even in the severe winter. (7) More than 1,500 canteens in the county have realized self-flowing water pipeization by building water towers or water tanks, eliminating the phenomenon of manual water carrying and further liberating labor. The self-flowing water pipes of the other 1,400-plus canteens will also be completed within the next three days. (8) Stove Great Leap Forwardization: The stoves of the county's 2,500 canteens have been changed from the original one stove and one pot to one stove and three or four pots in series, which not only greatly improves the work efficiency of the cooks, but also saves coal. The coal consumption has been reduced from the past 1.6 jin per person per day to 0.5 to 0.7 jin. It is estimated that the county can save more than 250 million jin of coal throughout the year.

 As a result of realizing the "Eight Transformations," the ideological concerns of some commune members who thought that public canteens were easy to manage in warm weather but could not survive the winter have been completely dispelled, enabling the broad masses of commune members to truly eat their fill, eat well, and eat hot meals, greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members.

    对亲爱的劳动者给以无微不至的关怀
    滑县食堂又香又暖又卫生
    食堂“八化”：餐厅化，餐桌化，红薯面包化，饭菜多样化，汤菜暖缸化，馒头暖篓化，自流水管化，锅灶跃进化。
    本报郑州8日电　中共河南省滑县县委会认真加强对于食堂工作的领导，采取大放“卫星”的方法，在五天内，全县的二千九百多个公共食堂就基本上实现了“八化”：餐厅化、餐桌化、红薯面包化、饭菜多样化，汤、菜暖缸化、馒头暖篓化、自流水管化、锅灶跃进化。
    滑县从县、公社到队都普遍建立了专门领导福利事业的组织。各级党组织的书记和干部都深入食堂，通过与炊事员一道劳动，和农民一起进餐，发现绝大部分食堂在目前天气日渐寒冷的情况下，不但没有餐厅，出锅的菜、饭连最简单的保温设备也没有，社员们经常吃不到热饭；在菜饭的花样上，因为目前红薯在口粮中占主要地位，再加上管理与调剂的不好，不少食堂都是顿顿煮红薯，也引起了社员的不满；此外，在用水和煮饭上，由于工具落后，依靠人力担水，一灶一锅来煮饭，不只浪费人力，而且还经常不能保证按时吃饭。
    为了更巩固、提高公共食堂，使广大社员人人满意，中共滑县县委在认真总结先进食堂的经验后，于10月28日决定在全县范围内开展一个以实现“八化”为中心的改善公共食堂的群众性运动。并且建立了县委包社、社包大队、生产大队干部包食堂等层层包干负责制度，深入发动群众。不少地区群众都自动腾房子，兑集木料或砖坯，并且提出：“白天搞生产，夜晚突击建设食堂”等口号。结果经过五天的突击，全县二千九百四十五个公共食堂，基本上实现了“八化”：（一）餐厅化，全县现已建立新餐厅一千二百座，能容纳二十四万人，另从食堂附近腾出房子二万一千间，容纳三十一万五千人以上，共占全县总人口的95％强。另外，还有可供三万人就餐的八十座餐厅现在正在进行修建。（二）餐桌化，全县通过社员自动凑集旧饭桌，又加做一部分新的，现在已有餐桌七万二千五百张，一般六至八人一桌，有桌就餐的社员已达全县人口的80％以上。（三）85％的食堂实现了红薯面包化。作法是用红薯掺进少量的面烘烤制成，味美可口，受到广大群众欢迎。（四）饭菜多样化，最多的能够做到一个月吃饭不重样，一般的能做到在七到十天里吃饭不重样，最少的也能做到在三天内吃饭不重样。（五）汤、菜暖缸化，这多是用布包着棉絮或麦草敷在瓦缸上做成的，有的是砌在地上，在下面还可烧火加热。现在全县已设有暖缸九千四百五十个，平均四十五个人用一个暖缸，使70％的社员都能吃到了烫口的热饭。（六）馒头暖篓化（用稻草编成的），全县现在已设暖篓九千六百个，每四十五个人用一暖篓，其余的正在赶做，在严冬内也能保证人人吃到热馒头。（七）全县已有一千五百多个食堂通过修建水塔或水柜，实现了自流水管化，消灭了人力担水现象，而进一步解放了劳动力，其他一千四百多个食堂的自流水管在最近三天内也将建成。（八）锅灶跃进化。全县二千五百个食堂的锅灶已经由原来的一灶一锅改为一灶三锅或四锅的串锅，不仅大大提高了炊事人员的工作效率，而且还节约了烧煤，使由过去每人每天需煤一斤六两，减少为五两至七两，据计算，全县全年就可节约用煤二亿五千多万斤。
    由于实现了“八化”，彻底解除了某些社员认为公共食堂天气暖和时好搞，就是不能过冬的思想顾虑，使广大社员都能真正的吃饱饭、吃好饭、吃热饭，大大鼓舞了广大社员的生产情绪。
