Movement Within Movement, Procurement Relying on the Masses

Henan Exceeds Target for This Year's Cotton Procurement

Guangxi Completes 90% of Pig Procurement Plan

Inner Mongolia Makes a Push to Procure Agricultural, Pastoral, and Local Specialty Products

Anhui Accelerates the Procurement and Transfer of Agricultural Products

(Reported by this newspaper) Henan Province has exceeded its cotton procurement target. As of November 12th, Henan Province had procured a total of 9.06 million dan of ginned cotton, accounting for 100.6% of the annual cotton procurement target, launching the first "cotton procurement satellite" for exceeding the 1958 (production year) cotton procurement task.

Henan Province's cotton procurement work was carried out while ensuring the "Marshal" of steel production was achieved and amidst busy farm work. Although labor was very tight, the progress of cotton procurement has been rapid. Their specific methods are: First, the Party Committee took the lead, and the leaders personally took charge, placing cotton procurement at the center of current tasks while ensuring steel production and completing wheat sowing tasks. Second, labor was further properly arranged, and the shortage of labor and transportation capacity was reasonably resolved. Third, communist cooperation was carried out extensively, tapping potential and supporting each other. The entire province mobilized more than 8.2 million cadres, workers, students, children, urban residents, and cadre family members, and even the elderly in the Happiness Homes actively and enthusiastically participated in this shock campaign. Fourth, in the course of the movement, the advanced procurement methods of "Four On-the-Spots" and "Four Self-Services" were widely implemented, thereby simplifying procurement procedures and saving a lot of labor, which was well received by the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 14th. In the intervals between mass movements for steel, transportation, and autumn harvesting, commercial departments in Guangxi rely on the masses to make a concentrated effort to procure agricultural and sideline products, doing it both quickly and well. Statistics up to the 9th show that live pigs have already completed 90.8% of the annual procurement plan, beef cattle 128.8%, mao bamboo 167.4%, sun-cured tobacco 132.9%, jute 137.6%, and other products have also largely approached the completion of the annual procurement plan.

The reason why Guangxi's procurement work was completed quickly and well this year is mainly because the Party Committee grasped it tightly, arranged it in a timely manner, and adopted the method of "large movements within small movements, long movements within short movements, seizing every opportunity," with a few days of preparation and one day of concentrated effort.

People's Communes in various places have played a huge role in the concentrated procurement.

This newspaper, Hohhot, 14th. Commercial purchase and sales forces in various parts of Inner Mongolia are going deep into rural areas, pastoral areas, mines, and construction sites to make a concentrated effort to procure agricultural, pastoral, local, and sideline products, and are supplying large quantities of various means of production and livelihood.

When purchasing agricultural, pastoral, local, and sideline products in large quantities, many commercial departments in the Autonomous Region have fully utilized social forces to solve the difficulty of labor shortage. The steel procurement shock team organized by the Horqin Right Wing Middle Banner in Hulunbuir League mobilized thirty-two mobile vehicles, relied on the People's Communes, and adopted the method of on-the-spot procurement, centralized delivery, and supply and marketing cooperatives receiving the goods. After five days of hard work, they procured 86,000 jin of scrap steel. Commercial departments in pastoral areas organize members of pastoral cooperatives to cut reeds and collect sheep manure, with cooperative members sending the goods to designated locations, and commercial departments procuring them regularly. This saves manpower and facilitates the masses.

On the supply and marketing front, commercial departments in various parts of Inner Mongolia put supporting steel production and central tasks such as autumn harvesting and autumn plowing in a primary position. Since mid-September, the Baotou City commercial department has successively sent more than 30 purchasing agents to various places to purchase equipment and tools needed for steel production. At the same time, materials such as iron sheets, wires, asbestos powder, asphalt, cement, and wood are given priority to furnace construction units.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 14th. Anhui Province is accelerating the procurement and transfer of agricultural products. As of November 9th, more than 1.98 billion jin of grain had been requisitioned, accounting for 66.4% of the province's target. As of the 8th, more than 770,000 dan of cotton had been procured, more than double that of the same period last year, when the procurement progress was the fastest. The procurement volume of flue-cured tobacco and hemp has increased by more than 20% compared with the same period last year. The procurement volume of pigs reaches a maximum of 20,000 heads per day, and generally stays at around 13,000 heads. Grain is being transferred in large quantities using active measures. The plan to transfer 500,000 live pigs out of the province has long been completed, and nearly 400,000 heads have recently been supported to various places. (Attached chart)

    运动套运动  收购靠群众
    河南超额完成今年购棉任务
    广西生猪收购计划完成90％
    内蒙突击收购农牧土特产品
    安徽农产品收购调运进度快
    本报讯　河南收棉任务已超额完成。河南省到11月12日共收购皮棉九百零六万担，占年度收棉任务的100.6％，放出了超额完成1958年度（生产年度）收购棉花任务的第一颗“收棉大卫星”。
    河南省的收棉工作是在保证钢铁“元帅”升帐和农活繁忙的情况下进行的，虽然劳力十分紧张，但收棉进度一直是很快的。他们的具体作法是：首先党委挂帅，领导亲自出马，在保证钢铁生产和保证完成种麦任务的前提下，把收棉工作列入了当前任务的中心。第二、进一步妥善的安排了劳动力，合理的解决了劳力、运力的不足问题。第三、开展了共产主义大协作，挖掘潜力，互相支援。全省共发动干部、工人、学生、儿童、城市居民和干部家属等达八百二十多万人，连幸福院的老年人也积极地、热情地投入了这一突击运动。第四、在运动进行中，广泛实行了“四就”、“四自”的先进采购方法，因而简化了收购手续，节省了大量的劳动力，群众反映很好。
    据新华社南宁14日电　在钢铁、运输和突击秋收的群众运动间隙，广西商业部门依靠群众突击收购农副产品，做得既快又好。到9日止的统计，生猪已经完成年度收购计划90.8％，菜牛128.8％，毛竹167.4％，晒烟132.9％，黄麻137.6％，其他各项产品也大都接近完成全年收购计划。
    今年广西收购工作完成得又快又好，主要是由于党委抓得紧，安排及时，采取了大运动套小运动，长运动套短运动，见缝插针，几天准备，一天突击的办法。
    各地人民公社在突击收购中发挥了巨大作用。
    本报呼和浩特14日电　内蒙古各地商业购销大军深入农村、牧区、矿山和工地，突击收购农牧土副产品，并大量供应各种生产和生活资料。
    在大购农牧土副产品时，自治区许多商业部门充分发挥了社会力量，解决了劳动力不足的困难。呼伦贝尔盟科尔沁右翼中旗组织的钢铁收购突击队，出动三十二台流动车，依靠人民公社，采取就地收购、集中交货、由供销社接收的办法，苦战五天就收购了废钢铁八万六千斤。牧区商业部门组织牧业社社员割苇子、拣羊粪，由社员把货送到指定地点，商业部门定期收购。这样既节省了人力又便利了群众。
    在供销战线上，内蒙古各地商业部门把支持钢铁生产和秋收、秋翻等中心工作放到首要地位。包头市商业部门从9月中旬以来，先后派出三十多名采购员，到各地采购钢铁生产所需要的器材和工具。同时把铁皮、电线、石棉粉、沥青、水泥、木材等物资优先供给建炉单位。
    据新华社合肥14日电　安徽省农产品收购调运工作进度加快。到11月9日，粮食已征购十九亿八千多万斤，占全省任务的66.4％。到8日，棉花已收购七十七万多担，比收购进度最快的去年同期还多一倍多。烤烟、麻类的收购量都比去年同期增长20％以上。猪的收购量最高每天达到二万头，一般都在一万三千头左右。粮食正采取积极措施大批调运。生猪外调五十万头的计划早已完成，最近又支援各地近四十万头。（附图表）
