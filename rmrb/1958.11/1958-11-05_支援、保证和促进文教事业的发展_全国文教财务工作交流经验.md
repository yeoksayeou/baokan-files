Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Health recently jointly convened a national conference in Tianjin to exchange experiences in cultural and educational financial work. After discussion, the conference clearly put forward that the guiding principle of cultural and educational financial work should be: to serve cultural and educational undertakings under the absolute leadership of the Party, to serve the direction of cultural and educational undertakings, that is, to serve politics, to serve production, and to serve the masses. The conference also pointed out that the specific tasks of cultural and educational finance should be: to support, guarantee, and promote the development of cultural and educational undertakings, and to strive to realize the current plans and future long-term plans of cultural and educational undertakings.

This conference was convened under the situation of an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in cultural and educational undertakings across the country. According to the information reflected by the conference, in 1958, cultural, educational, and health undertakings generally increased by one time compared with 1957, some even increased several times, and the lowest also increased by 50%, while budget expenditures only increased by 5%. Schools and cultural and educational institutions at all levels throughout the country, in implementing the Party's instructions that education must be combined with productive labor and that cadres must participate in physical labor, have vigorously established factories and farms, produced a large number of products, created a large amount of wealth for the country, and also obtained a large amount of economic income. Many educational, cultural, and health institutions have conscientiously implemented the Party's policy of building the country and running undertakings with diligence and thrift, actively mobilized the masses, tapped potential, developed undertakings, improved the quality of work, and at the same time saved a lot of manpower, materials, and financial resources for the country.

The conference discussed the problems in financial work that emerged during the Great Leap Forward in cultural and educational undertakings. These problems included the distribution of income from productive labor in cultural, educational, and health institutions, the issue of running undertakings with diligence and thrift, the management of cultural and educational funding in people's communes, and so on. The conference unified its thinking and unanimously agreed that the purpose of building the country and running undertakings with diligence and thrift is to run more undertakings, not to spend less money. Moreover, the labor production of cultural and educational departments has more important significance, mainly to transform the thinking of intellectuals, and also to gradually eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor.

Regarding the distribution of income from cultural and educational institutions running factories and farms for work-study programs and cadres participating in productive labor, the conference believed that the general principle is to distribute according to the spirit of communism, not according to labor remuneration. Therefore, it should mainly be used for expanding reproduction, increasing undertakings, and developing the business of the industry. These incomes do not need to offset the state budget, nor do they need to be turned over to the state treasury, but rather adopt the method of "snowballing" to supplement undertakings with undertakings, support undertakings with undertakings, and develop undertakings with undertakings, and use these incomes as much as possible to expand and develop the business of the industry. Secondly, these incomes can also be used for public welfare and personal living subsidies and rewards, but it should not be too much. If some units have more income, they can expand communist cooperation to support other units, or be dispatched and comprehensively arranged by the cultural and educational health authorities as appropriate. The conference also believed that the income from productive labor of cultural and educational health units can temporarily not be paid profit or taxes. The conference also unanimously proposed that the production and sales of products of cultural and educational health units should pay attention to the following points: First, production should be included in the state plan as much as possible; second, supply and marketing should be through national commercial institutions, and no free market should be engaged in; third, comply with the state's price policy.

Regarding the issue of running undertakings with diligence and thrift, the conference believed that building the country and running undertakings with diligence and thrift is mainly to develop production, run more undertakings, and improve the people's living standards, rather than blindly restraining life and restricting normal and necessary consumption. If limiting the development of undertakings simply from the starting point of saving money is a wrong and one-sided financial view. The conference believed that there is still great potential for saving in cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and we must continue to work hard to tap it. At the same time, cultural and educational health undertakings advocate saving to reduce the burden on the masses, not to make more money. Regarding the funds saved by various units due to running undertakings with diligence and thrift, the conference believed that according to the principle of implementing "budget contracting," they can be used as production funds or for expanding undertakings without being returned to the financial department. At the same time, mutual assistance and cooperation can also be implemented to support other more difficult units. The conference also believed that the money saved is somewhat different from production income, and it is best not to use it for welfare expenses or individual rewards.

Regarding the issue of the cultural and educational financial management of people's communes, the conference believed that, in principle, all cultural and educational undertakings originally managed by townships should be delegated to the management of people's communes, and property can be transferred through transfer procedures without pricing and selling. After the undertakings are decentralized, the operating expenses should also be allocated accordingly. Some loss-making enterprises and undertakings should be taken care of after being decentralized to the communes.

The conference also discussed the issues of cultural and educational financial work must rely on the leadership of the Party and put politics in command, financial work must follow the mass line to achieve everyone managing finances and everyone supervising, implement decentralization of financial power, graded contracted management, and improve the work methods and work style of cultural and educational financial work.

Rong Zihe, Vice Minister of Finance, summarized the discussion at this conference. During the conference, Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture, Liu Aifeng, Vice Minister of Education, and He Biao, Vice Minister of Health, all gave speeches. The persons in charge of finance and cultural and educational units in Tianjin reported on the typical experience of the Great Leap Forward in financial work of cultural and educational undertakings in Tianjin, which received the attention of the conference.

More than 390 people attended the conference, including the responsible persons of the financial, cultural, educational, and health administrative departments of 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as some special zones and counties, and representatives of grassroots units of cultural and educational health undertakings in various places.

### 支援、保证和促进文教事业的发展  全国文教财务工作交流经验

    支援、保证和促进文教事业的发展
    全国文教财务工作交流经验
    新华社4日讯　财政部、文化部、教育部和卫生部最近在天津市联合召开了全国文教财务工作经验交流会。会议经过讨论，明确提出了文教财务工作的方针应该是：在党的绝对领导下为文教事业服务，为实现文教事业的方针服务，也就是为政治服务，为生产服务，为群众服务。会议也指出了文教财务的具体任务应该是：支援、保证和促进文教事业的发展，为实现文教事业当前的计划和将来的远景计划而努力。
    这次会议是在全国文教事业空前大跃进的形势下召开的。根据会议反映的情况，1958年文教、卫生事业一般都比1957年增加了一倍，有的甚至增加几倍，最低的也增加了50％，而预算支出却只增加了5％。全国各级学校和文教事业单位在贯彻党的教育必须与生产劳动相结合和干部必须参加体力劳动的指示中，大办工厂、农场，生产了大量的产品，为国家创造大量财富，也获得了大量的经济收入。许多教育、文化、卫生事业单位都认真执行了党的勤俭建国、勤俭办事业的方针，积极发动群众，挖掘潜力，发展了事业，提高工作质量，同时又为国家节约了大量的人力、物力、财力。
    会议针对文教事业大跃进中同时出现的财务工作中的问题，进行了讨论。这些问题包括有文教卫生事业单位生产劳动的收益的分配问题、勤俭办事业的问题、人民公社文教事业经费的管理问题等等。会议统一了思想，一致认为勤俭建国、勤俭办事业，其目的是为了多办事业，不是为了少花几个钱。而文教事业部门进行劳动生产更有重要的意义，它主要是为了改造知识分子的思想，也是为了逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。
    关于文教事业单位因为办工厂、农场搞勤工俭学和干部参加生产劳动的收益的分配问题，会议认为总的原则是按共产主义精神进行分配，不是按劳取酬，因此它主要是应该用于扩大再生产，增办事业发展本行业务。这些收益不必用来抵国家预算，也不必上缴国库，而是采用“滚雪球”的办法来以事业补事业，以事业养事业，以事业发展事业，尽可能地用这些收益来扩大发展本行事业。其次，这些收益也可以用于公共福利和个人生活补助与奖励，但不宜太多。某些单位收入多了，可以扩大共产主义协作，支援别的单位，或由文教卫生主管部门酌情调度，全面安排。会议也认为，文教卫生单位生产劳动收入可以暂时不上缴利润，也不缴纳税金。会议还一致提出：文教卫生事业单位的产品生产和销售要注意以下几点：一、生产要尽量纳入国家计划；二、供销要通过国家商业机构，不得搞自由市场；三、遵守国家的价格政策。
    关于勤俭办事业的问题，会议认为，勤俭建国、勤俭办事业，主要是为了发展生产、多办事业和改善人民生活，而不是盲目克制生活，限制正常的必要的消费。如果单纯从省钱出发限制了事业的发展，就是一种错误的片面的财政观点。会议认为，在文教卫生事业方面，节约潜力还是很大的，必须要继续努力挖掘。同时文教卫生事业提倡节约，是为了减轻群众的负担，不是要多赚钱。关于各单位因为勤俭办事业节约下来的资金，会议认为根据实行“预算包干”的原则，可以不交回财政部门，而用来作生产资金或用于扩大事业，同时也可以实行互助协作，支援别的比较困难的单位。会议还认为，节约下来的钱同生产收入有所不同，最好不要用于福利开支或者奖励个人。
    关于人民公社的文教财务管理问题，会议认为，在原则上凡是原来乡镇管理的文教事业都应该下放给人民公社管理，财产可以办理转账手续，不要作价卖给。事业下放后，事业经费也要随着划下去。某些有亏损的企业和事业，在下放给公社后应当予以照顾。
    会议还就文教财务工作必须依靠党的领导和政治挂帅，财务工作必须走群众路线作到人人理财大家监督，实行财权下放、分级包干管理，改进文教财务工作的工作方法工作作风等问题进行了讨论。
    这次会议的讨论，由财政部副部长戎子和作了总结。在会议期间，文化部副部长夏衍，教育部副部长刘皑风，卫生部副部长贺彪都讲了话。天津市财政和文教单位的负责人在会上报告了天津市文教事业财务工作大跃进的典型经验，受到了会议的重视。
    参加这次会议的有二十七个省、市、自治区和部分专区、县的财政、文化、教育、卫生行政部门的负责人，以及各地文教卫生事业基层单位的代表共三百九十多人。
