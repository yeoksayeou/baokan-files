Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 12th -- Construction of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway's Xining Hub Station has begun.

The Xining Railway Hub Station includes four stations, with a total track length of thirty-five kilometers. In addition to the equipment and devices that a general hub station should have, there will also be a large passenger car technical operation station. In the future, passenger cars from all directions can undergo vehicle maintenance, cleaning, and food replenishment here. The freight marshalling station will not only have dedicated arrival and departure track groups for both inbound and outbound directions, but will also construct a hump yard.
