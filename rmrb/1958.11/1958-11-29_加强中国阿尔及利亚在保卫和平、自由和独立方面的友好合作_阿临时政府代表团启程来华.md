Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 27th: A delegation from the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic left Cairo on the morning of the 27th for a visit to China.

The delegation is composed of Yousef Ben Khedda, Minister for Social Affairs of the Algerian Provisional Government, Mahmoud Cherif, Minister of Armaments and Supply, and Sha'ad Daleb, Head of the Information Office.

Maidani, Minister of Culture of the Algerian Provisional Government, and Chen Jiakang, Chinese Ambassador to the United Arab Republic, saw the delegation off at the airport.

Yousef Ben Khedda, Minister for Social Affairs of the Algerian Provisional Government, said at the airport that the Algerian people are not isolated in their struggle against French imperialism supported by U.S. imperialism, and that they have received the support of the people of all Arab and Asian-African countries, especially the great Chinese people.

He said: "We have the utmost admiration for the 600 million Chinese people and their leaders, who have completed one of the greatest revolutions in history. We are very happy that we will soon be able to meet with them. Our visit will strengthen the ties of cooperation and friendship between the people of our two countries in defending peace, freedom and independence of all countries."

He said that they were very happy to be visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese government. They are also very proud of this friendly gesture from the great Chinese people, and they will never forget China's recognition of the Provisional Government of Algeria. He said that this has encouraged the Algerian people in their struggle against imperialism.

Khedda said that France had mobilized 600,000 troops equipped with modern weapons to deal with the Algerian people. France has received the support of the Atlantic nations, mainly the United States, in the war, and the United States supports France in all aspects of diplomacy, military affairs, and finance. He also said that the United States talks about peace on the surface, but in reality, it is inciting war. The Algerian people are fully aware that the bombs, armored vehicles, and napalm bombs that have caused them great disasters are all provided by the United States.

He said that in the face of this collusion by the imperialists, the Algerian people are not isolated. They have the support of the Arab people and all the Asian and African people, especially the people of the great People's Republic of China. Like the Algerians, they have endured imperialist oppression and exploitation, and now they are supporting the Algerians in every way possible.

    加强中国阿尔及利亚在保卫和平、自由和独立方面的友好合作
    阿临时政府代表团启程来华
    新华社开罗27日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团27日晨离开开罗前往中国进行访问。
    代表团由阿尔及利亚临时政府社会事务部长优素福·本·赫达，军备和供应部长马哈茂德·谢里夫和宣传部办公室主任沙阿德·达列伯三人组成。
    阿尔及利亚临时政府文化部长迈达尼以及中国驻阿联大使陈家康到机场欢送代表团。
    阿尔及利亚临时政府社会事务部长优素福·本·赫达在机场上说，阿尔及利亚人民在反对美国帝国主义支持下的法国帝国主义的斗争中不是孤立的，他们得到了所有阿拉伯国家和亚非国家的人民、特别是伟大的中国人民的支持。
    他说：“我们对六亿中国人民和他们的领袖感到莫大的敬佩，他们完成了历史上最伟大的革命之一。我们感到很高兴，不久就可以同他们会晤了。我们的访问将加强两国人民在保卫各国和平、自由和独立方面合作和友谊的联系。”
    他说，他们应中国政府的邀请前往中国访问，感到非常高兴。他们还因伟大的中国人民的这种友好表示而感到非常自豪，他们永远忘不了中国承认阿尔及利亚临时政府的行动。他说，这样，阿尔及利亚人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中就得到了鼓舞。
    赫达说，法国动员了配备着现代武器的六十万军队来对付阿尔及利亚人民。法国在战争中得到了大西洋国家、主要是美国的支持，美国从外交、军事和财政各个方面支持法国。他又说，美国在口头上谈和平，而实际上却在煽动战争。阿尔及利亚人民充分认识到，他们遭受巨大灾难的那些炸弹、装甲车和凝固汽油弹都是美国提供的。
    他说，但是在帝国主义者的这种勾结面前，阿尔及利亚人民不是孤立的。他们有着阿拉伯人民和全体亚非人民、特别是伟大的中华人民共和国的人民的支持。他们同阿尔及利亚人一样，经受了帝国主义的压迫和剥削，现在他们正在用一切办法支持阿尔及利亚人。
