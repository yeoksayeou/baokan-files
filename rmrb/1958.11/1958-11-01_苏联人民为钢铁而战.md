　　Soviet People Fight for Steel
　　By our correspondents Chen Quanbi and Cui Yongchang
　　In the Soviet Union, whenever one talks about communist construction, people will first tell you about the good news from the steel front. Indeed, the Soviet Union's powerful, modernized steel industry is an important achievement of its communist construction. But this achievement did not come easily. The Soviet people have gone through many arduous struggles and spent a lot of effort to build the steel industry into what it is today. Take the famous Magnitogorsk steel plant, for example. It was built during the Soviet Union's first five-year plan. At that time, there were no machines and no cadres. The builders of the blast furnace were peasants from the countryside who had never seen a blast furnace before. But under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, these people used their own hands, shoveling earth with shovels, and transporting bricks with small carts, finally overcoming all difficulties and building a large-scale steel plant. Now, such steel plants are not only spread across the Urals and the banks of the Dnieper River, but will also appear in Siberia and the Kazakh steppes; the new steel plants are even larger in scale. The shovel has long been replaced by powerful excavators. The Soviet steel industry, like the entire Soviet state, is advancing by leaps and bounds...
　　According to the plan, the Soviet Union will produce 39.1 million tons of iron and 53.6 million tons of steel this year. Compared with 1957, the net increase in iron production will be 2.1 million tons, and the net increase in steel will be 2.6 million tons. Compared with 1950, iron has increased by 103%, and steel has increased by 96.3%, which means that steel production has doubled overall. Thirty years ago, the Soviet Union's steel production was only one-twelfth of that of the United States, but now it is one-half. The Soviet steel industry will have a leap forward in the next seven years. By 1965, steel production will increase by more than two-thirds compared with 1958. At that time, the Soviet Union will be close to the level of the United States in steel production!

　　Seven Blast Furnaces—Seven Giants
　　1958 is a very important year in the Soviet steel industry. Because this year not only has a large increase in production, but also prepares conditions for greater increases in steel production in the future. The Soviet Union will build seven large new blast furnaces this year. The volume of the blast furnaces is very large, with the largest reaching more than 1,700 cubic meters and the smallest reaching 1,033 cubic meters. The annual production capacity of the seven blast furnaces can reach about 4.5 million tons. The construction speed of these blast furnaces is also amazing. Only three or four years ago, it took one and a half to two years to build such a blast furnace, but now it only takes seven or eight months. The seven blast furnaces are like seven giants, and six of them have already begun to produce iron.
　　This summer, we visited the Krivoy Rog blast furnace, one of the seven blast furnaces. The volume of this blast furnace is 1,719 cubic meters, which is the largest in Europe. When we went there, it was the tense stage of construction. Construction work was non-stop day and night, and the construction site was full of a fighting atmosphere. Most of the participants in the construction were members of the Communist Youth League from various places. Responding to the call of the Party, they left their hometowns to contribute to the country's steel industry. The labor enthusiasm of the young people is fiery, so on this steel front, heroic deeds followed one after another. Zamasov, the secretary of the Communist Youth League, told us such a thing: One day in April, it started to rain when the top of the blast furnace was about to be installed. The huge metal parts became heavy and slippery after getting wet, and the ground was muddy, making the installation work very difficult. In the afternoon, the wind picked up, and the huge furnace top swayed in the wind after being lifted by a crane. The wind force at that time had reached the point where work could be stopped, but the workers knew that every minute was precious, and the sooner the blast furnace was built, the sooner it could produce iron for the country. Four members of the Communist Youth League volunteered to climb into the high altitude, disregarding the danger, and fought against the rain and wind for an afternoon, finally installing the furnace top in time.
　　The Bugle Call for Building the Third Steel Base Has Sounded
　　Eastern Siberia and Northern Kazakhstan in the Soviet Union have always been considered desolate and barren places, but the so-called "barren" is just an unfounded assumption. Soviet scientists have conducted large-scale surveys here in recent years. The results of the surveys completely overturned previous conclusions. They proved that Eastern Siberia is a place full of treasures and minerals everywhere. Many iron ore deposits with reserves of more than 1 billion tons have been discovered here, such as Abakan and Korshun. There is also an iron ore area with reserves of 5 billion tons between the Angara River and the Uda River. The iron content of the ore is as high as 52.7% and as low as 37.3%. Two-thirds of the coal in the entire Russian Federation is buried in this "barren" underground, and its reserves are an astronomical figure: 7 trillion tons! In addition, there are inexhaustible forests, rapids that can supply large-scale power generation, and many rare metals and oil indispensable to industry. Building a new industrial base, first of all a steel base, in this place has become an urgent task for the current Soviet communist construction. Now, the march to build the Soviet Eastern Steel Base has begun, and three future large-scale steel plants have officially started construction. These three plants are: the West Siberian Steel Plant, the Tashet Steel Plant, and the Karaganda Steel Plant. They can be said to be the vanguards of the Soviet Third Steel Base. Following them, eight or nine huge steel plants will appear here. These buildings will undoubtedly bring a real communist spring to the broad lands of Siberia and Kazakhstan.
　　In mid-September, we visited the Karaganda Steel Plant under construction. It is located near Temirtau. This steel plant is completely "starting from scratch." On this wasteland where only sagebrush and feather grass used to grow, a huge workers' residential area has now appeared. On a flat asphalt road, we also saw an archway made of iron frames. Although it has no artistic decorations, it is like a new triumphal arch for the Soviet heavy industry. A large slogan across the archway reads: "Kazakhstan's Magnitka is being built here - a shock construction project of the National Communist Youth League."
　　Comrade Popov, the director of the plant, is a Soviet expert who once came to China to help us build the steel industry. He can also say a few words in Chinese. He seemed to meet an old friend when he saw us. Comrade Popov warmly introduced us to the vision of this steel plant. He said that the Karaganda Steel Plant will not only be the largest steel plant in the Soviet Union, but also the largest steel plant in the world. The volume of the largest blast furnace here will reach more than 2,200 cubic meters, and the largest open hearth furnace can produce 1,500 tons of steel per day and night. Building such a large steel plant here has a solid foundation, because the Atasu iron mine, which was discovered not long ago, is more than 200 kilometers away from the factory, and coking coal comes from Karaganda. Cheap coal and iron can make it produce the cheapest steel in the Soviet Union. The scale of construction is very large. The metal parts and metallurgical equipment that need to be installed alone are more than 500,000 tons, and 160,000 cubic meters of refractory bricks are needed. In order to produce steel for the country as soon as possible, the workers participating in the construction put forward the slogan of having the No. 1 blast furnace produce iron before the October Revolution Day next year.
　　Here we also met an old Kazakh worker, Turmaganbetov, who participated in the construction of the first steel plant in Kazakhstan (Temirtau Steel Plant). He witnessed the first steel smelting in Kazakhstan. Turmaganbetov told us: Fifteen years ago, there were only a few small mud houses in Temirtau, and the residents had never seen a large factory. But the Soviet regime brought it a new life. In the spring of 1943, the construction of the Temirtau Steel Plant began. Because the German robbers occupied the Soviet southern steel base, the Soviet state urgently needed steel. The construction workers ignored all difficulties and worked day and night until they could no longer work before taking a rest. The work quotas were generally completed by about 700%-800%, because with steel, there would be victory. Although the situation is different today, the struggle for steel has greater significance. Building the Third Steel Base as soon as possible, catching up with the United States in steel production as soon as possible, and communism can be realized sooner. (Attached picture)

    苏联人民为钢铁而战
    本报记者　陈泉壁　崔永昌
    在苏联，只要谈到共产主义建设，人们首先要告诉你的便是钢铁战线上的佳音。的确，苏联强大的现代化的钢铁工业，是它共产主义建设的一项重要成就。但是这成就是来之非易的。苏联人民为了把钢铁工业建设成今天这个样子，不知经过了多少艰苦的斗争，花了多少心血。就以著名的马格尼托哥尔斯克的钢铁厂来说吧。它是在苏联第一个五年计划时期建起来的，那时候，没有机器，也没有干部，高炉建设者是来自农村的从来没有见过高炉的人。但是在苏联共产党领导下，这些人用自己的双手，用铁锹铲土，用小车运砖，终于战胜一切困难，把一个大型钢铁厂建成了。现在，这样的钢铁厂不仅遍布在乌拉尔和第聂伯河两岸，而且还将出现在西伯利亚和哈萨克草原；新的钢铁厂规模更大。铁锹也早已为强大的挖土机所代替。苏联的钢铁工业，同整个苏维埃国家一样，大踏步地前进着……
    按照计划，苏联今年将生产三千九百一十万吨铁，五千三百六十万吨钢。如果与1957年相比，铁的生产净增二百一十万吨，钢净增二百六十万吨。与1950年相比，铁增加了103％，钢增加了96.3％，也就是说钢铁产量算在一起翻了一番。三十年前苏联钢产量仅及美国的十二分之一，现在则为二分之一了。苏联的钢铁工业在未来的七年中将有一个飞跃式的前进，到1965年，钢铁的产量将比1958年增加三分之二以上。那时，苏联在钢铁生产上就几乎接近美国的水平了！
      七座高炉——七个巨人
    1958年在苏联钢铁工业上是非常重要的一年。因为今年不仅增产量大，而且要给以后钢铁更大的增产准备条件。苏联要在今年一年内建成七座大型新高炉，高炉的容积都很大，最大的达到一千七百多立方公尺，最小的也有一千零三十三立方公尺。七个高炉每年的生产能力可以达到四百五十万吨左右。这些高炉的建设速度也是惊人的，只不过三四年前，建设这样一座高炉需要一年半到两年的时间，现在则只用七八个月的时间。七座高炉像是七个巨人，如今已有六座开始出铁了。
    今年夏天我们曾经到七座高炉之一的克里沃依罗格高炉参观。这座高炉的容积是一千七百一十九立方公尺，是欧洲最大的。我们去时，正是建设的紧张阶段，建设工作昼夜不停，工地上一片战斗气象。参加建设的大部分是来自各地的共青团员，他们响应党的号召，别离了自己的家乡，来为国家的钢铁工业尽一份力量。青年们的劳动热情是火热的，因此，在这个钢铁战线上，英勇事迹一个接一个。共青团书记扎马索夫告诉了我们这样一件事：4月里的一天，正要安装鼓风炉炉顶的时候下起雨来，巨大的金属部件着了雨以后又重又滑，地上泥泞不堪，安装工作非常困难，下午又刮起风，偌大的炉顶被起重机吊起来以后在风中摇荡。当时的风力已经达到了可以停工的程度，但是工人们知道每分钟都是宝贵的，高炉早一天建成就能为国家早一天出铁。四个共青团员自告奋勇爬上高空，不顾危险，与雨水大风斗争了一个下午，终于把炉顶及时装上。
    建设第三个钢铁基地的号角吹响了
    苏联的东西伯利亚和北哈萨克斯坦过去一向被认为是荒凉贫瘠的地方，但是所谓“贫瘠”只不过是一种毫无根据的臆想。苏联科学家近年来在这里进行了大规模的勘察，勘察的结果完全推翻了以前的论断，他们证明东西伯利亚是个遍地皆宝到处是矿的地方。这里发现了许多蕴藏量在十亿吨以上的铁矿，例如阿巴干、可尔松就是。在安加拉河与乌达河中间还有一个蕴藏量达五十亿吨的铁矿区，矿石的含铁量最高的达到52.7％，最低的也有37.3％。全俄罗斯联邦三分之二的煤埋在这“贫瘠”的地下，它的蕴藏量是个天文数字：七万亿吨！另外，这里还有取之不尽的森林，有可以供应大规模发电的激流，还有许多稀有金属和工业中不可缺少的石油。在这地方建设一个新的工业基地，首先是钢铁基地，已经成了目前苏联共产主义建设的迫切任务。现在，建设苏联东方钢铁基地的进军号已经吹响了，三个未来大型钢铁厂已经正式开工建设，这三个厂是：西西伯利亚钢铁厂，塔谢得钢铁厂和卡拉干达钢铁厂。它们可以说是苏联第三钢铁基地的先锋，继它们之后这里还将出现八、九个巨大的钢铁厂。这些建筑无疑会给宽广的西伯利亚和哈萨克大地带来真正的共产主义的春天。
    在9月中旬我们参观了建设中的卡拉干达钢铁厂。它座落在季米尔—塔乌附近。这座钢铁厂完全是“平地起家”。在这一片从前只长苦艾和羽毛草的荒地上，如今已经出现了一个巨大的工人住宅区，在一条平坦的柏油路上我们还看到了一个用铁架搭成的牌坊，它虽然没有什么艺术装饰，但是它像是苏联重工业的一座新的凯旋门。横在牌坊上的一幅大标语写着：“这里建设着哈萨克斯坦的马格尼特卡——全国共青团的突击建设。”
    厂长波波夫同志是曾经到过中国帮助我们建设钢铁工业的苏联专家，他还会说几句中国话，他见到我们像是见到老朋友一样。波波夫同志热情地向我们介绍了这个钢铁厂的远景。他说，卡拉干达钢铁厂不但将是苏联最大的钢铁厂，并且也将是世界上最大的钢铁厂，这里最大的高炉容积将达到二千二百多立方公尺，而最大的平炉每昼夜可以生产一千五百吨钢。在这里建设这样一个大钢铁厂是有稳固基础的，因为距工厂二百多公里就是不久前发现的阿塔苏铁矿，并且焦煤就来自卡拉干达。廉价的煤铁，可以使它生产全苏最便宜的钢。建设的规模是很大的，仅只需要安装的金属部件和冶金设备就有五十多万吨，耐火砖要用十六万立方公尺。为了早日给国家生产出钢铁，参加建设的工人们提出了要让一号高炉在明年十月革命节前出铁的口号。
    在这里我们还遇到了一位哈萨克族的老工人图尔马干别多夫，他曾经参加了哈萨克斯坦第一个钢铁厂（季米尔塔乌钢铁厂）的建设工作，他是哈萨克斯坦第一炉钢水的目睹者。图尔马干别多夫向我们说：十五年前季米尔塔乌这地方只有几座小土房，居民根本没有见过大工厂。但是苏维埃政权给它带来了新生命，1943年春，季米尔塔乌钢铁厂的建设开始了。由于德国强盗占领了苏联南方钢铁基地，苏维埃国家迫切需要钢铁，建筑工人们不顾一切困难，每天不分昼夜地干，一直到干不动了才休息一下。工作定额一般都完成700％—800％左右，因为有了钢铁就有胜利。今天情况虽然不同了，但是争取钢铁的斗争有了更大的意义，早日把第三钢铁基地建成，早日在钢铁生产上赶过美国，共产主义就能早日实现。（附图片）
