    Liaoning Province Strives for a Great Leap Forward in Industry
    Launching Mass Movements to Tap Potential
    (Our newspaper's report from Lushun-Dalian, November 25th) The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an industrial conference in Lushun-Dalian, deciding to immediately launch a great leap forward movement on the province's industrial front, striving to transform the province's industry from mediocre to outstanding in the shortest possible time, complete this year's leap forward plan ahead of schedule, and prepare for an even greater production leap forward next year.
    The conference pointed out that Liaoning has already built a relatively complete industrial system centered on heavy industry. This year's steel production accounts for almost half of the country's total output, and the task of manufacturing mechanical equipment is also very large. Therefore, whether Liaoning's work is outstanding or not has a significant impact on the national socialist construction cause. Since the rectification campaign, the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the province's workers have been unprecedentedly high, and a leap forward situation has emerged in industrial enterprises. However, compared with the achievements already made this year with those of fraternal provinces, and compared with Liaoning's superior conditions such as a good industrial base, many new factories, and many large factories, it is not very outstanding.
    Why is Liaoning's industry not doing well enough? The conference believes that an important reason is that the past work was reform rather than revolution. The prominent manifestations are: the revolutionary line of launching mass movements formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao was not well implemented; revolutionary transformation in the technical field was not carried out, and the guiding ideology favored the "large" and the "foreign," and the Party's policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and developing large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously was not seriously implemented.
    After a thorough review and criticism of the above issues, the conference unanimously agreed that a large-scale mass movement must be launched on the province's industrial front to carry out a vigorous revolution, so that the province's industry can quickly undergo a thorough leap forward, in order to fully tap potential and vigorously support the whole country. The fundamental issue at present is to resolutely implement the Party's unified leadership and implement the "two participations, one reform, three combinations, and four greats" industrial constitution. Regarding the Party's leadership over enterprises, the conference believes that the Party organization in the enterprise is not only the leading core at the factory level, but also the leading core in workshops and work sections. The Party's leadership over administration, like its leadership over trade unions and the Communist Youth League, should be a comprehensive and absolute leadership from the ideological, organizational, and professional aspects. Regarding cadres participating in labor, the conference decided that in addition to participating in production leadership and production must be regularized and institutionalized, cadres must also spend one month each year participating in labor completely as an ordinary worker, following the instructions of the team leader. Regarding workers participating in management, the conference, based on the experience of Changchun First Automobile Factory and Dalian and other places, believes that it cannot only stay at the level of participating in daily group management, but must also develop to participate in administrative management, technical management, economic management, and planning management. When Dalian Shipyard was manufacturing a 3,000-horsepower marine diesel engine, many professors and experts initially believed that it was impossible to manufacture, because few countries in the world could manufacture such products; however, the factory was determined to trial-produce it, mobilized hundreds of workers to participate in the design and manufacture, everyone contributed ideas and did their best, and as a result, it was manufactured in three months. Regarding reforming rules and regulations, the conference listened to the experience of Anshan and other places, believing that currently it is necessary to combine the completion of the leap forward plan, mobilize the masses to break through those unreasonable rules and regulations, and on this basis, establish rules and regulations that are conducive to giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of workers. Regarding "three combinations," the conference believes that the Party must be the leader, the workers must be the main body, and the strength of cadres, technicians, and workers must be combined into one to achieve the unity of politics and technology, and the unity of theory and practice.
    This conference was a mobilization meeting for the province's industrial leap forward movement. The conference was filled with revolutionary spirit. The municipal and prefectural party secretaries, industrial ministers, basic construction ministers, and leading cadres of industrial enterprises who attended the conference studied the instructions of the central responsible comrades, further raised their understanding, liberated their thinking, and were full of energy. Comrades from many units contacted their own units at any time by telegram, telephone, etc., so that the meeting was connected with the working masses who were working hard outside the meeting, encouraging each other. Many enterprises in Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Anshan, Fuxin, Fushun, Benxi, Yingkou and other cities, according to the spirit of the conference, held mass meetings overnight, setting off a new upsurge of big blooming, big contending, big-character posters, and big debates, launching a fierce attack on unreasonable rules and regulations and dogmatic thinking. Countless telegrams and letters flew from factories, railways, and construction sites to the conference like snowflakes, requesting that a competition to "pull out white flags and plant red flags" be launched between cities and enterprises in the province. After full deliberation, many comrades attending the conference decided to adopt the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, adopt the method of self-reliance, and take "four don'ts" (don't want labor, funds, equipment, or electricity) or less want as a condition, so that next year's production will leap forward by leaps and bounds, and at the same time march towards large-scale, precision, advanced, cutting-edge products and technologies.

### 辽宁省力争工业大翻身  大搞群众运动大挖潜力

    辽宁省力争工业大翻身
    大搞群众运动大挖潜力
    本报旅大25日电　中共辽宁省委最近在旅大召开工业会议，决定在全省工业战线上立即开展一个大翻身运动，力争全省工业在最短期间内从不出色变为很出色，提前完成今年跃进计划，并为明年更大的生产跃进做好准备。
    会议指出，辽宁已经建成了比较完整的以重工业为中心的工业体系，今年的钢产量几乎占全国总产量的一半，机械设备的制造任务也很大。因此，辽宁工作得出色或不出色，对全国的社会主义建设事业有着重大影响。整风以来，全省职工的劳动积极性和创造性空前提高，工业企业中出现了跃进局面。但是，今年已经取得的成就同兄弟省份比较，同辽宁具有的工业基础好、新工厂多、大工厂多等优越条件比较，是不很出色的。
    为什么辽宁的工业搞得不够出色呢？会议认为：重要原因在于过去的工作是改良，而不是革命。突出的表现是：没有很好地执行党中央和毛主席制订的大搞群众运动的革命路线；没有在技术方面进行革命性的改造工作，领导思想好“大”喜“洋”，对于党的土洋结合、大中小并举的方针没有认真贯彻执行。
    会议对上述问题进行了深入的检查批判以后，一致认为：必须在全省工业战线上大搞群众运动，开展一个声势浩大的大革命，使全省工业迅速来一个彻底的大翻身，以便充分挖掘潜力，大力支援全国。当前根本的问题，就是坚决实行党的一元化领导，贯彻执行“两参、一改、三结合、四大”的工业宪法。关于党对企业的领导，会议认为，党组织在企业里不仅是厂一级的领导核心，而且在车间、工段中也是领导核心。党对行政的领导，像对工会、共青团一样，要从思想上、组织上、业务上进行全面的绝对的领导。关于干部参加劳动，会议决定：干部除参加生产领导生产必须经常化、制度化而外，每年还要有一个月的时间完全以一个普通劳动者的身分参加劳动，听从小组长指挥。在工人参加管理方面，会议根据长春第一汽车厂和大连等地的经验，认为不能只停留在参加小组日常管理上，还必须发展到参加行政管理、技术管理、经济管理和计划管理等领域中去。大连造船厂在制造三千马力航用柴油机的时候，起初有许多教授和专家都认为没有条件制成，理由是现在世界上能制造这种产品的国家不多；可是，这个厂决心试制，发动了几百个工人参加设计和制造，人人献计，各尽所能，结果三个月就制成了。在改革规章制度方面，会议听取了鞍山等地的经验，认为当前要结合完成跃进计划，发动群众冲破那些不合理的规章制度，并在这个基础上，建立起便于发挥工人积极性和创造性的规章制度。关于“三结合”，会议认为：必须以党为领导，以工人为主体，把干部、技术人员和工人三方面的力量结合为一体，实现政治和技术的统一，理论和实践的统一。
    这次会议是全省工业大翻身运动的誓师大会。会议进行过程中充满了革命精神。出席会议的市、地委书记、工业部长、基本建设部长和工业企业的领导干部，学习了中央负责同志的指示，进一步提高了认识，解放了思想，干劲高涨。许多单位的同志随时用电报、电话等同本单位联系，使会议同会外正在苦干的职工群众联系起来，互相鼓舞。沈阳、旅大、鞍山、阜新、抚顺、本溪、营口等城市的许多企业，都根据大会精神，连夜召开群众大会，掀起了大鸣大放大字报大辩论的新高潮，向不合理的规章制度和教条主义思想展开了猛攻。无数的电报和信件雪片般由工厂、铁路、建设工地传到大会上，要求全省各市之间、各企业之间展开拔白旗、插红旗的竞赛。许多出席会议的同志经过充分酝酿，决定根据土洋结合的方针，采取自力更生的办法，以“四不要”（不要劳动力、资金、设备、电力）或少要为条件，使明年的生产大步跃进，同时向大型、精密、高级、尖端的产品和技术进军。　（张向波）
