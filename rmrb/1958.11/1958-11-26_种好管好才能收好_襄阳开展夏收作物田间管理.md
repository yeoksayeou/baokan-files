Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 25th. The Xiangyang Special District in Hubei Province is actively carrying out a field management campaign centered on accumulating and applying fertilizer, loosening soil and weeding, and reforming ditches and ridges, striving to achieve a greater bumper harvest next year for summer harvest crops including wheat, rapeseed, barley, and broad beans.

This year, the winter planting work in Xiangyang Special District has been carried out quickly and well. The 13 million mu of summer harvest crops sown throughout the district have seen the implementation of yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing, fertilization, and close planting better than in any previous year. After the seedlings emerged, various localities promptly carried out seedling inspection and replanting. As a result, various winter crops are growing particularly uniformly and vigorously, with lush greenery everywhere. Under these circumstances, some cadres and masses developed complacency. They said, "Even if we don't work hard in cultivation, a bumper harvest next year is guaranteed."

This situation immediately attracted the attention of the leadership. In order to reverse complacency and slackness, and to strengthen field management in a timely manner, Party organizations in various localities generally educated cadres and the masses on the principle that good planting, good management, and good growth are essential for a good harvest. Gucheng, Xiangyang, Guanghua and other counties also educated the masses by summarizing the winter planting to find loopholes. The summaries revealed that some places plowed deeply and planted densely, but the amount of fertilizer applied did not meet the plan; some places achieved deep plowing, close planting, and more fertilization, but the sowing was uneven, and so on. In this way, cadres and the masses reversed their complacency, and field management work centered on accumulating and applying fertilizer, loosening soil and weeding, and reforming ditches and ridges was launched throughout the district. Currently, various localities have allocated 30% of their labor force to vigorously accumulate and apply fertilizer, and some areas have already formed a high tide.

Because the planting density of wheat has generally increased this year, the row spacing has been reduced, and cross and wide-strip sowing has been promoted, this has brought new problems to field management technology. For example, the hoes used for loosening soil and weeding in previous years cannot be used this year, and various localities are rushing to make small hoes. Various localities are also preparing to carry out winter harrowing on a large scale to promote the increase of effective tillers. At the same time, a large number of rollers are also being manufactured, preparing to universally compact the wheat fields once, in order to break up the soil to prevent freezing and preserve moisture, and to prevent lodging and inhibit excessive growth.

### 种好管好才能收好  襄阳开展夏收作物田间管理

    种好管好才能收好
    襄阳开展夏收作物田间管理
    据新华社武汉25日电　湖北省襄阳专区正在积极开展以积肥追肥、中耕锄草以及沟畦改革为中心的田间管理运动，力争明年包括小麦、油菜、大麦和蚕豆的夏收作物获得更大丰收。
    今年，襄阳专区冬播工作进行得又快又好。全区播种的一千三百万亩夏收作物，深耕、施肥和密植等增产措施，都比以往任何一年贯彻得好。禾苗出土以后，各地又及时地进行了查苗补苗。因此，各种越冬作物都长得特别整齐茁壮，到处是一片葱绿。在这种情况下，有些干部和群众便滋长了自满情绪。他们说，“即使不再加工培育，明年大丰收也是稳的”。
    这种情况立即引起了领导上的重视。为了扭转自满松劲情绪，及时加强田间管理，各地党组织普遍对干部和群众进行了种好、管好、长好才能收好的教育。谷城、襄阳、光化等县还通过总结冬播寻找漏洞的办法来教育群众。在总结中发现有的地方耕得深种得密，但施肥量未达到计划；有的地方虽然做到了深耕、密植和多施肥，但播得不匀，等等。这样一来，就使干部和群众扭转了自满情绪，于是，以积肥追肥、中耕除草和沟畦改革为中心的田间管理工作，便在全区范围内开展起来。目前各地都已拿出30％的劳动力，大搞积肥追肥，有些地区已经形成高潮。
    由于今年小麦种植密度普遍加大，行距缩小以及推行了交叉、宽幅播种，这就给田间管理技术上带来了新的问题。例如，往年中耕锄草时使用的锄头，今年不能用了，各地正在赶制小锄。各地还准备普遍进行冬耙。以促进有效分蘖的增加。同时，还大量制造铺滚，准备对麦田普遍镇压一次，以便碎垡防冻保墒，并防止倒伏、抑制疯长。
