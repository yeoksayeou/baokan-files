Public Canteens Praised by Everyone

	Guarantee Vegetables in Winter
	Our Baotun Village in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, has a total of seventy households, three hundred and twenty people, and four production teams (one of which is a Korean team). Since the establishment of the canteen in August, the number of people eating in the canteen has been increasing day by day. Now, everyone in the village participates in the canteen.
	With so many people eating in the canteen, their tastes differ. The elderly prefer to eat soft food, while the young prefer to eat hard food; Han people like to eat sour food in winter, while Koreans like to eat spicy food. However, these problems must be solved to satisfy everyone. Our canteen has installed six pots (one of which is exclusively for Koreans), one for cooking vegetables, and four for cooking rice (or making *bobber*); among them, one pot is specially used to cook soft food for the elderly. In addition, there are five small pots for stir-frying dishes, cooking noodles, and boiling dumplings. There is a wide variety of pickles and green vegetables. We pickled more than 10,000 *jin* of pickles, including pickled chili peppers, Korean cabbage, salted radish, salted kohlrabi, salted carrots, salted green beans, eggplant, chive flowers, and chili sauce; we also pickled thirty vats (15,000 *jin*) of sauerkraut and prepared 4,000 *jin* of *dajiang* (soybean paste). We have already dried 8,000 *jin* of dried vegetables. Our canteen has seven cooks, both Han and Korean, who are skilled in making both simple and elaborate dishes, steaming, stir-frying, and deep-frying. There is soft food for those who like it soft, and hard food for those who like it hard; there are expensive and inexpensive dishes, sour and spicy dishes; summer has summer vegetables, and winter has winter vegetables, both cheap and delicious. The canteen also provides special care for patients, new mothers, and the elderly, making everyone who eats in the canteen very satisfied.

专栏：公共食堂人人夸

    保证冬天有菜吃
    我们吉林省蛟河县保安屯，一共七十户人家，三百二十口人，四个生产队（其中有一个朝鲜族队）。自8月份举办食堂以来，吃饭的人一天天增多，现在全屯的人都参加了食堂。
    在食堂吃饭的人多，胃口不同，老年人愿意吃烂乎的，青年人愿吃硬的；汉族人冬天愿意吃酸的，朝鲜人愿意吃辣的，各不相同。但这些问题必须想办法解决，做到大家满意。我们食堂安了六口锅（其中有一口专给朝鲜族用），一口熬菜，四口做饭（或做饽饽）；其中又专用一口锅做烂的给老年人吃。此外，又安了五口炒菜、下面条、煮饺子的小锅。咸菜和青菜是多种多样的，光咸菜就腌了一万多斤，其中有咸辣椒、朝鲜白菜、咸萝卜、咸疙疸、咸胡萝卜、咸豆角、茄子、韭菜花、辣椒酱；又渍了三十缸（一万五千斤）酸菜，还准备四千斤大酱。现在，已经晒八千斤干菜。我们食堂有七名炊事员，有汉族有朝鲜族，做粗拉的会，蒸炒爆炸也会。吃烂的有烂的，吃硬的有硬的；贵的贱的，酸的辣的都有；夏天有夏天的菜，冬天有冬天的菜，又便宜又可口。食堂对病人、产妇、老年人又进行了专门的照顾，使得参加食堂吃饭的人都很满意。
