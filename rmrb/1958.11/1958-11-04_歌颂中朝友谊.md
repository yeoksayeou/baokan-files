    Ode to Sino-Korean Friendship
    Guo Moruo
      Ascending Eulmil Pavilion [Note]
  Eight years since last Eulmil Pavilion, four voids welcome gentle breeze.
  Reborn goddess will be forever present, planting red flags throughout the land.
  [Note] Eulmil Pavilion is on the banks of the Taedong River, also known as Sasu Pavilion. I visited it in November 1950 during my visit to Korea.
        To Shi Jiying
  Burning tea, gathering vegetables, forgetting life and death, rescuing brothers in fire and water.
  Beautiful stories spread about Shangganling, Shi Jiying is most touching.
  [Note] Shi Jiying was an active female comrade who supported the Volunteer Army. During the Battle of Shangganling, she braved the rain of bullets, gathering wild vegetables and delivering tea for the Volunteer Army.
    Visiting the Underground Machinery Factory in Huichon
  Legend says there are blessed lands in caves, but underground factories have never existed.
  Today, the cave is truly a blessed land, the master machine electrifies and moves the universe. On the way to Huichon, villagers presented local products as gifts
              Presenting Gifts
  A basket of pine nuts, a box of ginseng, a jar of honey, an inkstone.
  Earnest affection, earnest words, seeing guests as if seeing one's own mother.
        Boating on the Yalu River
  A river of green, paddling in the middle, frost-covered forests on both banks dyeing the hills.
  A hundred-zhang high dam connects the motherland, the autumn sun shines brightly overhead.
  Visiting the Supung Dam Hydroelectric Station, Supung electricity is truly abundant, autumn colors are equally divided with the river. The green blood congeals, making the mountains firm, the people's heroes are forever paired.
  Visiting the Industrial Exhibition Hall, Calcium carbide as clothing, reeds woven into silk, the people's century sees magic. Cotton and mulberry are also reported to increase production, from now on, frost and ice will turn into wild geese flying.
  Ode to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Eight-Year History of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, The flower of friendship will last forever in the universe. Forever suppressing the west wind, laying the foundation for the Great Harmony in China.
  Ode to the Korean People Piercing the Paper Tiger and Building Great Achievements, the reunification of the country is in sight. The international spirit spreads throughout the universe, the Korean nation is heroic.
  To the China-Korea Friendship Association, Sino-Korean friendship for thousands of years, like brothers, shoulder to shoulder. Defending the country and protecting the home together against the enemy, heroes' blood stains the battle flag brightly.
  Inscription on a Painting for Korean Comrades, A dragon steed travels a thousand miles a day, the country's fortune rises constantly like this. Instantly galloping across the Han River, transporting the east wind into the southern border.

    歌颂中朝友谊
    郭沫若
      登乙密台〔注〕
  八载重临乙密台，四虚迎得惠风来。
  再生神女将恒在，插得红旗遍九陔。
  〔注〕乙密台在大同江畔，又名四虚台。1950年11月访朝鲜时曾登临。
        赠石吉英
  烧茶采菜忘生死，火热水深救弟兄。
  佳话流传上甘岭，感人最是石吉英。
  〔注〕石吉英乃支援志愿军积极女同志，上甘岭战役，在弹雨中出生入死，为志愿军采集野菜，烧送茶水。
    参观熙川地下机械工厂
  洞天福地传闻有，地下工厂自古无。
  今日洞天真福地，母机电化动坤枢。在赴熙川道上乡人纷纷以物产
              馈赠
  松子一篮参一箱，蜂糖一罐砚一方。
  殷勤情谊殷勤语，道见客人如见娘。
        在鸭绿江中弄舟
  一江碧绿棹中流，两岸霜林染黛丘。
  百丈高堤联祖国，秋阳皓皓曝当头。
  参观水丰发电站水丰电力信然丰，秋色平分共一江。碧血凝教山岳固，人民英烈永成双。
  参观工业展览馆电石为衣芦织丝，人民世纪见神奇。棉桑况复闻增产，从此冰霜化鹜飞。
  颂中国人民志愿军八年抗美援朝史，宇宙长垂友谊花。永使西风遭压倒，大同基业奠中华。
  颂朝鲜人民戳穿纸虎建丰功，统一江山在望中。国际精神传宇内，朝鲜民族是英雄。
  赠朝中友好协会中朝友谊数千年，如弟如兄肩并肩。卫国保家同抗敌，英雄血染战旗鲜。
  题画赠朝鲜同志龙驹一日行千里，国运恒升亦如此。瞬时驰骋汉江?，输送东风入南鄙。
                          〔未完〕
