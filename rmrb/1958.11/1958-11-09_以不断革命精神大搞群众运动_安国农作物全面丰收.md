Promote Mass Movements with the Spirit of Continuous Revolution
	An'guo Achieves Overall Bumper Harvest of Crops

This newspaper reports: The diligent and brave people of An'guo County, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, and after a year of hard work, have achieved an unprecedented agricultural bumper harvest.

The average per-mu yield of grain crops in the county was 3,600 jin, an increase of 6.67 times compared to last year; the average per-mu yield of cotton was 210.1 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of 3.22 times compared to last year; the average per-mu yield of peanuts was 548 jin, an increase of 2.6 times. There were 29,187 mu of large-area, high-yield farmland with yields of 5,000 jin or more per mu, and two townships reached an average yield of 5,000 jin or more per mu.

The victory of the agricultural bumper harvest has greatly changed the economic face of An'guo County. The county averaged 4,700 jin of grain per person. This year, the county sold more than 56 million jin of grain to the state and stored more than 141 million jin of grain. Thus, the grain problem has been fundamentally solved. The victory of the agricultural bumper harvest has also greatly changed people's mental outlook, making them further realize the great role of human subjective initiative, inspiring their spirit of continuous revolution, and setting off a larger-scale production upsurge. The victory on the agricultural production front this year has also greatly changed the county's natural landscape. Starting from last winter, after more than eight months of hard work, the county basically realized mechanized irrigation. Before spring planting, all 400,000 mu of barren land in the county were initially realized as garden plots. All crops planted in the county achieved regionalized planting, standardized sowing, and densely planted superior seeds. In the management of crops, scientific management was also implemented. This has greatly changed the county's natural landscape. The masses have compiled a ditty to praise the changes in the natural landscape: Conquering nature follows people's wishes, machines and motors roar across the sky, crops grow according to people's will, drought and flood yield double insurance, the ground is as flat as a mirror, furrows and ditches are straight, plant spacing is equidistant like telephone poles, the ground is level, fertile, and standardized, and scientific management guarantees increased production.

The victory of An'guo County's agricultural Great Leap Forward this year is the result of fighting against nature, and it is the result of the An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Party organizations at all levels using the mass line method and launching mass movements on a large scale. The county party committee, based on the laws of natural development and the spirit of continuous revolution, also proposed the fighting slogan of "revolutionary eight months, sixteen fighting sections, hard work and desperate efforts, determined to surpass last year," and formulated a year-round program for leading production movements on a monthly and seasonal basis. Therefore, a huge force was generated among the masses, one movement after another, one upsurge after another, which was carried out throughout the year and achieved a major victory.

    以不断革命精神大搞群众运动
    安国农作物全面丰收
    本报讯　勤劳勇敢的安国县人民，在总路线的光辉照耀下，经过一年来的苦干，获得了空前未有的农业大丰收。
    全县粮食作物平均亩产三千六百斤，比去年增长六点六七倍；棉花平均亩产皮棉二百一十点一斤，比去年增长三点二二倍；花生平均亩产五百四十八斤，比去年增长二点六点。全县出现了亩产五千斤以上的大面积高额丰产田二万九千一百八十七亩，有两个乡达到了平均亩产五千斤以上。
    农业大丰收的胜利，大大改变了安国县的经济面貌。全县平均每人合粮食四千七百斤，今年全县卖给国家粮食五千六百多万斤，储备粮食一亿四千一百多万斤。至此，粮食问题从根本上得到了解决。农业大丰收的胜利，也大大改变了人们的精神面貌，使人们进一步认识到人的主观能动性的伟大作用，激发了人们不断革命的精神，掀起更大规模的生产高潮。今年农业生产战线上的胜利，也大大改变了全县的自然面貌。从去冬开始，一连苦干八个多月，使全县基本实现了灌溉机械化。到春播前，全县四十万亩白地全部实现了初级园田化。全县所种作物全部达到了种植区域化，播种规格化，优种密植化。在农作物的管理上，还实行了管理科学化。这就大大改变了全县的自然面貌。群众编了顺口溜，来歌颂自然面貌的变化：征服自然随人愿，机器马达响彻天，庄稼按人意志长，旱涝齐收双保险，地平如镜垅沟直，株行等距似线杆，地平肥足规格化，科学管理保增产。
    安国县今年农业大跃进的胜利，是向自然进行斗争的结果，是由于中共安国县委和各级党组织运用群众路线的方法，大搞群众运动的结果。县委根据自然的发展规律和不断革命的精神，并提出了“革命的八个月，战斗的十六节，苦干拼命干，决心胜头年”的战斗口号，按月分季，制定了全年领导生产运动的奋斗纲要。因此，在群众中产生了巨大的力量，一个运动接一个运动，一个高潮接一个高潮，一直贯彻到全年，取得了重大的胜利。
