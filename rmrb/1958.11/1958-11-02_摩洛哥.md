　　Morocco
　　On November 1, our country and Morocco formally established diplomatic relations.
　　Geographically, Morocco and our country can truly be said to be "separated by vast oceans." Morocco is located in northwestern Africa, with an area of nearly 450,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately ten million. It is bordered by Algeria to the east and south, faces the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and is separated from Spain by the Strait of Gibraltar to the north. It is rich in mineral resources, especially phosphate, the output of which ranks second in the world. Morocco was founded in the Middle Ages, and the 11th to 15th centuries were its most prosperous period in history. At that time, Morocco's territory extended from Spain to Tunisia and Tripoli. Morocco's culture was quite developed at that time. The cultural relics and historical sites in some cities of Morocco today are evidence of this.
　　However, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Morocco gradually became a victim of imperialist plunder. In 1912, France forced the Sultan of Morocco to sign the "Treaty of Fez," and from then on, Morocco became a French "protectorate." In the same year, in order to ease the imperialist rivalry over Morocco, France and Spain agreed to划 divide northern Morocco and the southern Ifni region into Spanish "protectorates." In 1923, the "Paris Convention" stipulated that the important seaport of Tangier should be designated as an international co-administered zone.
　　After half a century of struggle, the Moroccan people finally achieved independence in March 1956; in October of the same year, they regained sovereignty over Tangier. The people of Morocco, after independence, are still waging an unremitting struggle to recover the Ifni region.
　　Morocco has won independence for two and a half years, but the United States, France, and Spain still station large numbers of troops on Moroccan territory. The United States has also repeatedly announced that it will not abandon its air bases in Morocco. This situation seriously threatens the integrity of Morocco's territorial sovereignty. The calls of the Moroccan government and people for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the abolition of foreign military bases on Moroccan territory are growing louder. (Qiao)

    摩洛哥
    11月1日，我国和摩洛哥已经正式建立了外交关系。
    摩洛哥在地理上和我国真可以说是“远隔重洋”。摩洛哥在非洲西北部，面积将近四十五万平方公里，人口约一千万，东、南与阿尔及利亚为邻，西濒大西洋，北隔直布罗陀海峡与西班牙遥相对望。这里矿藏丰富，尤以磷酸盐最为重要，产量占世界第二位。摩洛哥建国于中世纪，十一世纪到十五世纪是它历史上的最盛时期，那时摩洛哥的领土从西班牙直到突尼斯和的黎波里。当时摩洛哥的文化已相当发达。今日摩洛哥一些城市中的文物和古迹便是个明证。
    但是，在十九世纪末和二十世纪初，摩洛哥逐渐成为帝国主义抢夺下的牺牲品。1912年，法国强迫摩洛哥苏丹签订“非斯条约”，从此，摩洛哥沦为法国的“保护国”。同年，为了缓和帝国主义之间对摩洛哥的争夺，法国和西班牙协议将摩洛哥北部以及南部伊夫尼地区划归西班牙“保护”。1923年，“巴黎公约”又规定把重要海港丹吉尔划为国际共管区。
    摩洛哥人民经过半世纪的斗争，终于在1956年3月取得了独立；同年10月，重新获得了对丹吉尔的主权。独立后的摩洛哥人民，至今仍在为收复伊夫尼地区进行着坚持不渝的斗争。
    摩洛哥赢得独立已有两年半了，但是至今美国、法国和西班牙仍把大量军队驻在摩洛哥领土上，美国也一再宣布不放弃它在摩洛哥的空军基地，这种情况严重地威胁着摩洛哥领土主权的完整。摩洛哥政府和人民要求撤出一切外国军队和撤销摩洛哥领土上外国军事基地的呼声正越来越高。（樵）
