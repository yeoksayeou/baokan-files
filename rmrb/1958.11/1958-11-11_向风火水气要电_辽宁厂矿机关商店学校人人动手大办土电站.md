Seek Electricity from Wind, Fire, Water, and Air
Liaoning Factories, Mines, Government Offices, Stores, and Schools All Mobilize to Build Indigenous Power Stations

(Our report) Following the "small-scale, indigenous, and mass" line, and putting electricity generation "first," Liaoning Province is launching a high tide of electricity generation by the whole Party and all the people. They are determined to work hard for three months to increase generating capacity by 400,000 to 500,000 kilowatts, paving the way for even greater leaps forward in industry and agriculture next year. The increased generating capacity is equivalent to two large power stations.

Since August, under the leadership of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee at all levels, Liaoning Province has launched a mass movement for electricity generation by the whole people. Factories, mines, government offices, stores, schools, and the military are all taking action to generate electricity. In the Xinfu District of Fushun City, 37 units in the industrial, financial and trade, cultural and educational, and health systems had built 35 power stations powered by water, steam, animal power, and gas by the beginning of October. The power generation accounts for 18% of the district's total electricity consumption. The teachers and students of one primary school used scrap steel they recycled to exchange for a waterwheel and a small donkey, and built an "animal-powered power station" with the small donkey and a modified waterwheel.

The various small power stations built by the masses are driving the production of various equipment. This powerfully refuted the view of "skeptics" who believed that small power stations built by the masses could only be used for lighting and could not solve any major problems. The thousands of small power stations built by the staff and workers of the handicraft industry in Shenyang City using indigenous methods have a power generation capacity of more than 3,000 kilowatts, which means that many factories and cooperatives have not only not stopped production due to lack of electricity, but have also increased the total output value of the city's handicraft industry. Many factories and mines, such as Liaoyang Textile Factory, Yingkou Paper Mill, and Jinzhou Paper Mill, have proposed: "All electricity will be self-supplied." In addition to supplying its own electricity, the Luda City Oil and Fat General Factory has the surplus capacity to transmit 1,050 kilowatt-hours to the national power grid within ten days.

More importantly, the broad masses have used their wisdom to create many valuable experiences in electricity generation by the whole people. The workers of the Xinfu District Carpenter Cooperative in Fushun City even allowed sewage from the sewers to generate electricity and built a "sewage power station."

(Our report) The mass electricity generation campaign launched by Dalian City based on the principle of "small-scale, indigenous, and mass" has already achieved great results. In the past two months or so, tens of thousands of indigenous power stations, small power stations, or power stations combining indigenous and foreign methods have appeared in every corner of the city. As of November 2, their total generating capacity reached 75,373 kilowatts (not yet fully operational). Now, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, and street residents are responding to the call of the Dalian Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China to "make long-term plans and rely on self-reliance," and continue to work hard, determined to generate 130,000 kilowatts by the end of the year to prepare power for next year's great leap forward in production.

Now, walking on the road, people can see countless windmill impellers rotating in the wind on top of the buildings of factories, government offices, schools, and stores. They carry generators of varying sizes, transmitting electricity to workshops, classrooms, and stores. Long-abandoned diesel engines, steam engines, internal combustion engines, and electric motors in various enterprises have been collected, repaired, and assembled into self-supplied small power stations. Industrial wastewater from chemical plants and tap water from water plants have also been used to build hydropower stations ranging from a few kilowatts to hundreds of kilowatts. According to the characteristics of Dalian City, which is surrounded by the sea on three sides, many places have also used sea tides to build dozens of kilowatts of tidal power stations. In a very short period of time, the people of Dalian City have adopted sixteen methods to extract electricity from wind, fire, water, gas, steam, and all other materials that can be used, so that dozens of units have not only maintained production with their own power stations, but have also transmitted electricity to the national power grid. Many light industrial factories, which were forced to stop work in July and August due to lack of electricity, have seen a leap forward due to self-built power stations. At night, many students have begun to review their lessons under their own electric lights, and many stores have also begun to receive customers under their own electric lights.

The reason why the mass electricity generation campaign in Dalian City has produced results so quickly is the result of putting politics in command, emancipating the mind, and breaking down superstitions. In the course of the campaign, the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China successively held three broadcasting conferences for electricity generation competitions with the participation of hundreds of thousands of people, mobilized the masses to criticize the mysterious views, negative waiting sentiments, and erroneous ideas of attaching importance to big things and neglecting small things, and attaching importance to foreign things and neglecting indigenous things that some people held about electricity generation; and established electricity generation headquarters at all levels, organized a large number of technical forces, collected various power generation materials and equipment, and helped departments and streets with poor conditions to build power stations. The electricity generation campaign quickly spread among workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, and street residents. The Jinzhou Textile Factory stopped its machines due to lack of electricity. The workers said: It is a small matter to take less wages for stopping production, but if the textile production plan cannot be completed, everyone will have no clothes to wear! They quickly generated electricity using biogas, coal gas, car heads, and indigenous turbines manufactured by themselves. Some workers heard that a speedboat had sunk in the nearby sea decades ago, so they disregarded the cold and went into the sea to salvage it and dismantled the diesel engine to generate electricity. Now most factories are manufacturing their own power generation equipment, determined to fight hard until the end of the year to achieve self-sufficiency in electricity, and some are even preparing to generate more electricity to support other factories.

(Our report) All the staff and workers of the Dalian Textile Factory, in the days of power shortage, all took action and contributed ideas to obtain power from all available power sources to solve their own production needs.

Dalian Textile Factory is a factory with 50,000 spindles. On September 5th of this year, due to the tight power supply in the Northeast, the power company began to stop supplying power to this factory. In this situation, the textile workers held a meeting to find ways to find more than a dozen ways to generate electricity from wind, fire, water, and gas. Five planners from the planning section and electrician Wang Jinglun conducted an experiment on generating electricity from low tide at the seaside. They deepened the original dam base, raised the embankment, and then put a small "water turbine" made of wood and iron sheets into the water, using rope as a belt, connected to the generator, and used the power of seawater to impact the water turbine to make a small light bulb light up. Now, on the beach in front of the factory, a 20-horsepower water turbine has begun to generate electricity, and the methods of using wind power, biogas, and flue gas flow to generate electricity in various sections and workshops have also been successful.

    向风火水气要电
    辽宁厂矿机关商店学校人人动手大办土电站
    本报讯　走“小土群”路线，让电力“先行”上马，辽宁省掀起全党全民办电的高潮。他们决心苦战三个月，增加发电能力四十万到五十万瓩，为明年全省工农业更大跃进开路。新增的发电能力，等于两个大型电站。
    自8月以来，在中共辽宁省各级党组织领导下，辽宁省展开了一个全民办电的群众运动。厂矿、机关、商店、学校、军队都动手办电。抚顺市新抚区工业、财贸、文教、卫生四个系统三十七个单位，到10月初办起水、汽、畜力、瓦斯各种动力的电站三十五个，发电量占全区用电量的18％。一个小学校的师生，用自己回收的废钢铁，换一台水车和一头小毛驴，用小毛驴和改装的水车建立起一座“畜力电站”。
    广大群众办的各种小型电站，正在带动着各种设备进行生产。有力地驳斥了“怀疑派”认为群众办小型电站，只能用来点灯，不能解决什么大问题的看法。沈阳市手工业系统职工用土法办的千百座小电站，发电能力达三千多瓩，使得许多工厂和合作社，不仅没有因为缺电而停产，而且使全市手工业系统的生产总值有了增加。辽阳纺织厂、营口造纸厂、锦州造纸厂等许多厂矿，都提出：“用电全部自给”。旅大市油脂总厂除了供应自己用电外，还有余力在十天之内，向国家电网输电一千零五十度。
    更重要的成就是：广大群众用自己的智慧，创造了许多全民办电的宝贵经验。抚顺市新抚区木工社职工，甚至让阴沟里的污水也来发电，建设起来一座“污水电站”。
    本报讯　旅大市根据“小土群”方针开展的全民办电运动，已经收到了巨大的效果。两个多月以来，有上万个土电站、小电站或土洋结合的电站，出现在全市各个角落。到11月2日为止，它们的总发电能力达到了七万五千三百七十三瓩（还没有完全运转）。现在，工农兵学商和街道居民正响应中共旅大市委提出的“长期打算，自力更生”的号召，继续苦干，决心到年底办电十三万瓩，为明年生产大跃进准备动力。
    现在，走在马路上，人们可以看到在工厂、机关、学校、商店的建筑物上边，有无数的风车叶轮迎风旋转，它们带着大小不等的发电机，为车间、课堂、商店输送着电流。各企业单位废弃已久的柴油机、蒸汽机、内燃机和电动机……，都被搜集起来加以检修，并凑成自备的小型发电站。化工厂的工业废水和自来水厂的自来水也被利用起来修成了几瓩到百瓩的水电站。根据旅大市三面临海的特点，许多地方还利用大海潮汐建成了几十瓩的潮汐电站。在很短的时间内，旅大市人民采用了十六种办法，向风、火、水、气、汽等一切可能利用的物质索取电力，使数十个单位，不仅用自己的电站维持了生产，同时还向国家电网输送了电流。7、8月份由于电力缺乏被迫停工的许多轻工业工厂，又因自办电站出现了跃进局面。夜晚，许多学校的学生已开始在自己的电力照明下温习功课，许多商店也开始在自己的电力照明下接待顾客。
    旅大市全民办电运动所以很快地产生效果，是政治挂帅、解放思想、破除迷信的结果。中共旅大市委在运动过程中连续召开了三次有数十万人参加的办电比武广播大会，发动群众批判部分人对办电存在的神秘观点、消极等待情绪和重大轻小、重洋轻土的错误思想；并且成立各级办电指挥部，组织了大批技术力量，搜集了各种发电的资料和设备，帮助条件较差的部门和街道办电站。办电运动很快在工农兵学商和街道居民中开展起来。金州纺织厂因为缺电，机器停工了，职工们说：停止生产少拿点工资是小事，完不成纺织生产计划，大家没有衣服穿可不行！他们很快就用沼气、煤气、汽车头和自己动手制造的土透平发出了电。有些职工听说几十年前沉在附近海里一艘快艇，就不顾寒凉，下海把它打捞上来，拆下柴油机来发电。现在多数工厂都自己制造发电设备，决心奋战到年底，做到用电自给，有的还准备多发电支援其他工厂。
    本报讯　大连纺织厂全厂职工，在缺电的日子里，人人动手，个个献计，向一切可以利用的动力索取电源，解决自己生产的需要。
    大连纺织厂是一个拥有五万纱绽的工厂。今年9月5日，由于东北电力供应紧张，电业局开始停止对这个工厂供电。在这一情况下，纺织工人们大伙儿开会想办法，找到了十几项向风、火、水、气要电的办法。计划科的五个计划员和电工王景伦一起在海边进行用落潮发电的试验。他们挖深了原来的坝基，加高了堤岸，再将一个用木头和铁片做的小“水轮机”放到水里，用绳子当皮带，连在发电机上，利用海水冲击水轮的力量，使一个小灯泡发出了亮光。现在，工厂门前的海滩上，二十马力的水轮机已经开始发电，各科室车间利用风力、沼气、烟道气流发电的办法也得到成功。（附图片）
