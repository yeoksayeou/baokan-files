Report from our newspaper: The autumn harvest has entered a tense final stage. Some provinces and regions are increasing labor and organizing raids to accelerate the harvest, and the progress of the autumn harvest has generally accelerated.

Currently, a mass movement to rush harvest late rice has been launched in the southern regions. In provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian, the late rice harvesting work has entered a busy period. Provinces such as Guizhou, Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Hunan have basically completed or are nearing completion. Hubei Province has also completed the single-season late rice harvest and is rushing to harvest double-season late rice. Yunnan and Jiangsu have harvested about 80% of their late rice. At the same time, these regions are also rushing to harvest late autumn coarse grains, oil crops, and tuber crops. With the exception of Fujian and Guangdong, other provinces have generally harvested nearly half of their tuber crops, Sichuan has harvested more than half, and Jiangsu has harvested about 70%. Slower regions have only harvested about 20%. The serious problems currently facing the northern provinces are rushing to harvest cotton, peanuts, and sweet potatoes. Shandong and Henan have harvested about 80% of their cotton, sweet potatoes, and peanuts. However, whether it is Henan, Hebei, or Shandong, there is still a large amount of cotton to be picked, and it is still far from clearing the cotton stalks and cleaning the fields. Great efforts are still needed. As for the northeast and northwest regions, they are currently rushing to transport crops and thresh.

In order to recover the losses caused by the relatively rough harvesting work, some regions that have completed or basically completed the harvesting work have launched a second autumn harvest campaign. Some places in Shanxi, Liaoning, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Hubei have organized large numbers of women, children, and elderly people to go to the fields to pick up crops and re-dig sweet potato fields, and mobilized commune members to carry out a second threshing. Liling County in Hunan Province organized 100,000 people to conduct a second autumn harvest, and in three days of raids, it harvested an additional 1.2 million catties of rice. Ganyu County in Jiangsu Province recovered 12 million catties of sweet potatoes in the second autumn harvest; Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province, in addition to harvesting a large amount of rice and sweet potatoes, also recovered 230,000 catties of sesame.

The recent acceleration of the autumn harvest progress and the ability to organize a large number of people to launch a second autumn harvest campaign is the result of local leading organs making overall arrangements for various tasks and re-unified deployment of labor. In order to fight the final battle of this year's great leap forward in agricultural production and strive for a complete bumper harvest, the leading organs in many regions, while ensuring the completion of steel production tasks, have drawn a portion of the labor force from the steel front to invest in the autumn harvest; the labor force occupied by the three autumn harvests has also been reallocated according to priorities. For example, in order to rush harvest late rice in a timely manner, Guangdong Province plans to temporarily reduce the 4 million people invested in deep plowing to 2 million people, concentrating its efforts on rushing the harvest; after the winter wheat sowing work is basically completed in the Yellow River basin, in addition to fixing a batch of manpower to form a professional team for wheat field management, a large number of people will be concentrated on rushing to harvest cotton, sweet potatoes, and other crops. Due to the unified arrangement of labor in various places, the manpower invested in the autumn harvest has been strengthened. The Ministry of Agriculture pointed out: The autumn harvest is currently very urgent, and all regions must immediately strengthen leadership, organize a raid harvesting campaign, and strive to quickly clear the fields. The harvesting and threshing work in many areas is still relatively rough, and a second autumn harvest is urgently needed; in the Yellow River basin and its northern regions, many places have a portion of the harvested grain crops that have not yet been transported into the fields. In some areas, 40% or even 60% of the crops have not been threshed, a large number of cotton bolls have not been picked in time, and a portion of sweet potatoes have not been harvested. The harvested sweet potatoes have not been completely stored in cellars and sliced and dried in time, and spoilage has already occurred. These problems should be taken seriously. In particular, the north is already cold, and all forces that can be mobilized should be organized to further speed up the work of rushing to harvest, thresh, store, finely harvest, finely thresh, and finely store, and strive to avoid or reduce losses and achieve a bumper harvest.

Hubei Daily News: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hubei Provincial People's Committee issued an emergency notice on November 3 on strengthening the harvest of various economic crops, the full text is as follows:

This year, the production of various economic crops in our province, like agricultural production, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, and many products have increased several times. It is now the harvest season, and all regions should vigorously organize rushing to harvest, harvest well in a timely manner, process well, and store well, just like organizing the autumn harvest in agriculture, and truly achieve a bumper harvest. Various economic crops account for a considerable proportion of the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries, and an even greater proportion in mountainous and aquatic areas, and must be treated equally with agricultural production and strengthened leadership. However, some areas have not paid enough attention, leadership is weak, and the labor force is not well arranged, and some products that have matured have not been harvested in time. This is a serious problem and should be resolved immediately.

To this end, party committees and people's committees at all levels, especially key counties and townships in mountainous and aquatic areas, should have secretaries in charge, dedicated personnel responsible, organize various professional teams, seize the season, harvest in a timely manner, formulate plans, complete them within a time limit, and ensure that nothing is lost or rotted; harvest well, process well, and store well. We must also seize the leadership of forest tree seed collection and fish fry fishing and not miss the opportunity.

In the process of organizing the harvest, we must widely mobilize the masses, hold on-site meetings or physical exhibitions, compare accounts, conduct large-scale debates, and do a good job of ideological mobilization; organize large-scale raids, large-scale cooperation, and large-scale competitions, and establish the red flag of production experts. At the same time, we must vigorously carry out tool reforms to save labor and improve work efficiency, and ensure a bumper harvest of various economic crops. (Attached picture)

    调整劳力  组织突击
    各地秋收进度显著加快
    农业部指出：时间紧迫，要进一步组织力量，抢收抢打抢藏
    本报讯　秋收进入了紧张的最后阶段。有些省区为此正增调劳动力，组织突击抢收，秋收的进度一般已经加快。
    现在，南方各地普遍展开了突击抢收晚稻的群众运动。广东、福建等省，晚稻收获工作已经进入大忙时期，贵州、四川、江西、湖南等省已经基本收完或接近基本收完，湖北省一季晚稻也已收完，正在抢收双季晚稻，云南、江苏的晚稻已经收了80％左右。同时这些地区还抢收了晚秋杂粮、油料和薯类作物。除福建、广东等省外，其他各省的薯类作物一般收了将近一半，四川在一半以上，江苏已收70％左右，较慢的地区才收了20％。北方各省当前的严重问题是抢收棉花、花生和甘薯。山东、河南棉花、甘薯和花生已收了80％左右。但是，无论河南、河北、山东等省，现在都还有大批棉花待摘，离拔除棉秆、地净场光还远，还须作极大的努力。至于东北、西北各地正在突击拉运庄稼和打场。
    为了挽回由于收获工作比较粗糙所造成的损失，部分收割工作已经结束或基本结束的地区，发动了二次秋收运动。山西、辽宁、浙江、江苏、湖南、湖北等省都有些地方组织了大批妇女、儿童和老人下地拣庄稼和重刨甘薯地，并且发动社员进行第二次脱粒。湖南省醴陵县组织了十万人进行第二次秋收，在三天的突击中，即多收稻谷一百二十万斤。江苏省赣榆县在二次秋收中拾回了一千二百万斤山芋；湖北省襄阳专区除多收了大量稻谷和甘薯外，还收回了二十三万斤芝麻。
    最近以来，秋收进度加快，并能组织大批人力展开二次秋收运动，是各地领导机关对各项工作进行全面安排重新统一调配劳力的结果。为了打好今年农业生产大跃进最后这一仗，力争全部丰产丰收，很多地区的领导机关都在保证完成钢铁生产任务的前提下，由钢铁战线上抽出一部分劳力投入了秋收；对三秋工作占用的劳力，也根据轻重缓急进行了重新调配。如广东省为了及时抢收晚稻，计划投入深翻的四百万人，即暂时减为二百万人，集中力量突击抢收；黄河流域各地，在冬小麦播种工作基本结束后，除固定一批人力组成专业队进行麦田管理外，即集中大批力量抢收棉花、甘薯等作物。由于各地对劳力进行了统一安排，投入秋收的人力加强了。农业部指出：目前秋收已非常紧迫，一切地区都必须立即加强领导，组织突击抢收运动，争取迅速地净场光。很多地区收割和脱粒工作仍然比较粗糙，急需进行二次秋收；黄河流域及其以北地区，很多地方都有一部分已经割倒的粮食作物还没有运进场来，有些地区还有40％甚至60％左右的作物没有脱粒，大批吐絮的棉花没有及时采摘，甘薯还有一部分未收，已经收了的甘薯由于没有作到全部及时入窖和切片晒干，腐烂现象已经发生。这些问题急应引起重视。特别是北方各地已经天寒地冻，应该组织一切可以动员的力量进一步加紧抢收、抢打、抢藏和细收、细打、细藏工作，力争避免或减少损失，作到丰产丰收。
    湖北日报消息　中共湖北省委会、湖北省人民委员会于11月3日发出关于加强多种经济作物收获的紧急通知，全文如下：
    今年我省多种经济的生产，和农业生产一样，获得了空前的大丰收，许多产品都是成倍、成几倍地增加。目前正是收获季节，各地应当和组织农业上的秋收一样，大力组织抢收，及时地收好、加工好、保管好，真正地做到丰产丰收。多种经济在农副业总产值上占有相当的比重，在山区和水产区所占比重则更大，必须和农业生产一视同仁，加强领导。但是有些地区由于重视不够，领导无力，劳动力安排得不很好，某些已经成熟了的产品，未能及时收获，这是一个严重问题，应当立即解决。
    为此，各级党委、人委，尤其是山区、水产区等多种经济的重点县、乡，应由书记挂帅，专人负责，组织各种专业队，抢住季节，及时收获，订出计划，限期完成，保证不丢、不烂；收好，加工好，保管好。对于林木采种、捕捞鱼苗，亦须抓紧领导，勿失时机。
    在组织收获当中，要广泛发动群众，召开现场会或实物展览会，对比算账，开展大辩论，做好思想发动工作；组织大突击，大协作，大竞赛，树立生产能手的红旗。同时，还要大搞工具改革，以节省劳力，提高工效，确保多种经济的丰产丰收。（附图片）
