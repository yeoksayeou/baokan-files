    A Recent Example of "Stubborn But Not Incorrigible"
    Xia Ren
    Eighteen years ago, Chairman Mao said: "The stubborn elements are actually stubborn but not incorrigible. Stubborn to the end, they will change and become dog droppings despised by mankind." This passage, reprinted in the People's Daily on October 31st, still reads so fresh and interesting, as if it were addressing today's current events.
    On the same day's People's Daily, an example of "stubborn but not incorrigible" was published. Dulles said to British reporter Clarke: "Undoubtedly, we recognize Communist China as a fact because we deal with Communist China." "We also disagree with the blind policy of insisting that it does not exist. It does exist." So, how did Dulles come to know that "it does exist" and oppose "the blind policy of insisting that it does not exist"? It turns out that "it has killed and wounded about 100,000 Americans, so it obviously exists." (Dulles is lying again; the actual number is 390,000)
    The Americans who were killed and wounded were sent by the American government from tens of thousands of miles away by planes and warships to be beaten, so no one else is to blame. However, Dulles's words indeed prove a truth: stubborn elements are afraid of struggle; after seven or eight struggles, they will change. Of course, the stubborn but not incorrigible elements of the Dulles ilk will not become good, but will only become "dog droppings despised by mankind." But change is inevitable.

    “顽而不固”近例
    侠人
    十八年前，毛主席说过：“顽固分子，实际上是顽而不固，顽到后来就要变，变为不齿于人类的狗屎堆。”这段话，十月三十一日又重刊于人民日报上，读起来还是那样新鲜，有趣，好像是针对着今日的时事说的。
    在同一天的人民日报上，就刊有“顽而不固”的例子。杜勒斯对英国记者克拉克说：“无疑我们承认共产党中国是一个事实，因为我们同共产党中国打交道。”“我们也不同意硬说它不存在的那样一种盲目的政策。它的确是存在的。”那末，怎样使杜勒斯知道了“它的确是存在的，”而反对起“硬说它不存在的那样一种盲目的政策”来了呢？原来，“它曾经打死打伤了大约十万名美国人，因此它显然是存在的。”（杜勒斯又撒谎了，实在数字是三十九万）
    被打死打伤的美国人是美国政府用飞机、军舰从几万里外送来让打的，那怪不得别人。不过杜勒斯的话的确证明了一个真理：顽固分子就怕斗；七斗八斗，他就变了。自然，杜勒斯之流的顽而不固的分子，不会变好，只会变成“不齿于人类的狗屎堆。”但要变是无疑的。
