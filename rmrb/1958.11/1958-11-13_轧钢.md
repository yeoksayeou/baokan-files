Small Information

    Steel Rolling
    The process of pouring molten steel into ingots, heating the ingots in a heating furnace, and then using mechanical equipment to roll them into steel materials of the required shape is called steel rolling. Recently, the Northeast Institute of Technology has developed a non-ingot steel rolling equipment using indigenous methods, which can directly roll molten steel into steel materials.

    The main purpose of steel rolling is to roll steel ingots into various shapes of steel materials needed for our production and construction. Such as rolling into square steel, round steel, flat steel, rebar, I-beams, angle steel, channel steel, rails, steel plates, steel pipes, steel wires, etc. Another purpose is to make the internal structure of the steel ingot more delicate and compact through rolling, improving the quality of the steel and enhancing its physical properties.

    Steel rolling is divided into two types according to its processing state: cold rolling and hot rolling. Hot rolling is the process of heating steel ingots or billets in a heating furnace to 1000-1200℃ and then rolling them into shape. Cold rolling is the process of rolling steel billets into finished products with more precise dimensions and smoother surfaces without reheating. The machine used to roll steel is called a rolling mill.

    轧钢
    将炼出的钢，浇铸成钢锭，把钢锭送入加热炉内加热后，通过一定的机械设备压延成所需形状的钢材，叫做轧钢。最近，东北工学院已用土法制成了一种无锭轧钢设备，可用钢水直接轧成钢材。
    轧钢的目的，主要是将钢锭轧制成我们生产和建设需要的各种形状的钢材。如轧成方钢、圆钢、扁钢、螺纹钢、工字钢、角钢、槽钢、道轨、钢轨、钢板、钢管、钢丝等等。另一目的是使钢锭的内部组织，经过压延变得更加细致、紧密，改善了钢的品质和提高了钢的物理性能。
    轧钢按其加工状态不同，分为冷轧和热轧两种。热轧就是把钢锭或钢坯在加热炉内加热到1000—1200℃后再轧制成形。冷轧就是将钢坯不再加热而轧出尺寸更精确、表面更光滑的成品。用来轧制钢材的机器叫做轧钢机。
