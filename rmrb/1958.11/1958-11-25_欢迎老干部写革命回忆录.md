Welcome Veteran Cadres to Write Revolutionary Memoirs
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

It is not a new thing for veteran cadres to write revolutionary memoirs. As early as twenty years ago, the "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an published many revolutionary stories written by veteran cadres. Since the founding of New China, a number of revolutionary memoirs written by veteran cadres have appeared, such as the "Red Flag Fluttering" series, "The Glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army" (Volume 1, Collection 1, "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire"), which published many such articles. However, mobilizing veteran cadres on a large scale to write revolutionary memoirs is a new task put forward on the literary and artistic front during the current national Great Leap Forward. This work is of great significance.

First, revolutionary memoirs are a historical record of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership in the Chinese revolutionary struggle. In the past forty years, there have been countless inspiring stories in the revolutionary struggles in various regions and periods under the leadership of the Party. Countless outstanding revolutionary fighters have been tempered into steel in the flames of revolution. Some comrades sacrificed their precious lives for the revolution, and some comrades continue to contribute their strength to socialist construction today. For these living veteran comrades to write down the revolutionary history they have personally experienced is not only the best memorial to the martyrs, but also can profoundly educate today's young generation and our descendants. At the same time, these revolutionary memoirs will greatly enrich the treasure house of our Party history.

Second, the Party has put forward the task of building socialist literature. This task is not only the task of literary and art workers, but also the task of the whole Party and the whole people. Only when the whole Party and the whole people run literature and art, and the professional literary and art workers are combined with the amateur creations of the masses, can our task be successfully completed. Now our literature must first reflect the current reality of the socialist construction that is advancing rapidly, praise the brilliant labor of hundreds of millions of people who are creating miracles and their new spiritual outlook, reflect the buds of communism that have already appeared or are appearing in our lives, and promote their growth. At the same time, we also need works that reflect revolutionary historical themes. The production of works in this area, in addition to the creation of professional literary and art workers, must rely on veteran cadres scattered in various posts. Because to express this aspect of the subject matter, it is necessary to have rich life experience and understanding of revolutionary historical struggles, and veteran cadres have particularly superior conditions in this regard. Excellent revolutionary memoirs, no matter in what form they appear, will be an integral part of our revolutionary literature. Therefore, mobilizing veteran cadres to write revolutionary memoirs not only has significance in terms of political and ideological education, but is also an indispensable part of literary work.

Third, it should also be taken into account that many of our veteran cadres are relatively old, and some comrades are already approaching their seventies. If the revolutionary history they are familiar with is not recorded in time, it will never be possible to find it in the future. If these extremely valuable materials are lost, it will be an irreparable loss to our revolutionary history and literary history.

Of course, our advocacy of veteran cadres writing revolutionary memoirs does not mean that veteran cadres can only or should only write revolutionary memoirs. Many of our veteran cadres may and should also try various forms of literature and art, express various themes of life, especially create reportage literature, novels, poems, movies, and literary and artistic reviews that reflect the current reality. Many veteran cadres have already made good achievements in this area, and many veteran cadres have already drawn up plans in this area. These are all very gratifying phenomena. However, as mentioned earlier, veteran cadres have particularly superior conditions in writing revolutionary memoirs, and it can even be said that they have an inescapable responsibility. Therefore, we would like to specifically emphasize the issue of veteran cadres writing revolutionary memoirs.

At present, many regions are vigorously organizing veteran cadres to write revolutionary memoirs. For example, Hebei Province has launched a mass writing movement of "Praising the Great Leap Forward and Recalling Revolutionary History" with ten million pieces. Many literary journals have also edited many columns or special issues of revolutionary stories and revolutionary memoirs. Some editorial departments and publishing houses have made outstanding achievements in organizing forces to help veteran cadres write memoirs. In this work, we believe that there are several experiences that are worth noting:

First, the attention and strong support of the Party Committee's propaganda departments to this work is an important factor in doing this work well. The work of organizing veteran cadres to write revolutionary memoirs should be regarded as a part of carrying out revolutionary ideological education among the people. Specific plans should be drawn up, and forces should be organized to carry out the work. Some veteran cadres are undertaking heavy leadership work. If conditions permit, efforts should be made to give them time to engage in the writing of memoirs. This requires detailed arrangements to be made based on specific circumstances.

Second, local branches of the Writers Association, propaganda work departments of the troops, editorial departments of literary journals, publishing houses, etc., should do a good job in helping veteran cadres write memoirs. Among the veteran cadres, some have a higher level of education and writing ability, but some have a lower level of education and lack writing experience. This requires organizing a group of professional writers and literary editors to assist veteran cadres in writing for a longer period of time. The experience of Xie Nanzheng in helping veteran cadres write memoirs published in the 21st issue of "Wenyi Bao" is of reference value to various places.

Third, veteran cadres are the main creators of revolutionary memoirs. Many veteran cadres have shown a positive and enthusiastic attitude towards this work and have produced many excellent works. This shows that writing is not a mysterious thing. As long as you dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, coupled with the spirit of hard study and research, anyone can write. Many authors of revolutionary memoirs had never engaged in writing before, but under the guidance of relevant editors, they wrote moving works. Therefore, as long as we break superstitions and write boldly, we can definitely write good memoirs!

    欢迎老干部写革命回忆录
    本报评论员
    老干部写革命回忆录，并不是一个新事情，远在二十年前，延安“解放日报”就曾经发表过不少老干部写的革命故事。新中国成立以来，已经出现了好些老干部写的革命回忆录，如“红旗飘飘”丛刊，“光荣的中国人民解放军”（第一卷第一集“星火燎原”）等，就刊登了许多这类文章。但是，大规模地发动老干部写革命回忆录却是当前全民大跃进中，在文艺战线上所提出的一个新的任务。这项工作有着重大的意义。
    首先，革命回忆录是中国共产党领导中国革命斗争的历史纪实。近四十年来，在党所领导的各个地区、各个时期的革命斗争中，有着无数可歌可泣的故事。无数优秀的革命战士在革命的烈火中锻炼成钢。有的同志为革命献出了宝贵的生命，有的同志今天还继续在社会主义建设中贡献出自己的力量。由这些活着的老同志把自己亲身经历过的革命历史写下来，不仅是对先烈们最好的纪念，而且可以深刻地教育今天的青年一代以及我们的后代。同时，这些革命回忆录还将大大丰富我们的党史的宝库。
    其次，党提出的建设社会主义文学的任务。这个任务不只是文艺工作者的任务，也是全党全民的任务。只有全党全民办文艺，专业文艺工作者和群众业余创作结合起来，我们的任务才能胜利完成。现在我们的文学首先要反映当前建设社会主义的一日千里的现实生活，歌颂亿万人民创造奇迹的光辉劳动和他们崭新的精神面貌，反映我们生活中已经或正在出现的共产主义萌芽并促进它们的成长。与此同时，我们也需要反映革命历史题材的作品。这一方面作品的产生，除了专业文艺工作者的创作外，必须依靠散布在各个岗位上的老干部。因为要表现这方面的题材，必须对革命历史斗争有丰富的生活经验和理解，而老干部在这方面则具有特别优越的条件。优秀的革命回忆录，不论是以什么形式出现，它都将是我们革命文学的一个组成部分。因此，发动老干部写革命回忆录，不仅有着政治思想教育方面的意义，而且是文学工作中不可缺少的一个部分。
    第三，还应该考虑到我们的许多老干部年龄都比较大，其中有些同志已经年近古稀。如果不及时地把他们所熟悉的革命历史纪录下来，将来就会永远无法查寻。这些极其宝贵的材料如果湮没了，将是我们革命史和文学史的一个不可弥补的损失。
    当然，我们主张老干部写革命回忆录，并不等于说老干部只能或只应该写革命回忆录。我们的许多老干部也可能而且应该尝试文艺的各种形式，表现生活的各种题材，特别是创作反映当前现实的报告文学、小说、诗歌、电影、文艺评论。许多老干部已经在这方面作出了很好的成绩，还有许多老干部已经订出了这方面的计划。这都是非常可喜的现象。但是，正如前面提到的，老干部在写革命回忆录方面有着特别优越的条件，甚至可以说有着义不容辞的责任。所以，我们愿意特别强调地提出老干部写革命回忆录的问题。
    目前，许多地区已经在大力组织老干部写革命回忆录，如河北省展开了“歌颂大跃进，回忆革命史”一千万件的群众写作运动，许多文学刊物也编辑了不少革命故事和革命回忆录专栏或专号，有的编辑部和出版社在组织力量帮助老干部写回忆录方面作出了出色的成绩。在这个工作中，我们认为有几点经验是值得注意的：
    一、党委宣传部门对这个工作的重视和大力支持，是做好这个工作的重要因素。要把组织老干部写革命回忆录的工作看成是对人民进行革命思想教育的一个部分。订出具体的规划，组织力量进行工作，有些老干部担任着繁重的领导工作，如果条件容许的话，设法使他们有时间从事回忆录的写作，这是需要根据具体情况作细致的安排的。
    二、各地作家协会分会、部队宣传工作部门、文学刊物编辑部、出版社等要做好帮助老干部写回忆录的工作。老干部中间，有一部分是有较高文化水平和写作能力的，但也有一部分文化水平较低，缺少写作经验。这就需要组织一部分专业作家、文学编辑，以较长的时间协助老干部写作。“文艺报”第二十一期发表的解南征帮助老干部写回忆录的经验对各地是有参考价值的。
    三、老干部是革命回忆录的主要创作者，许多老干部对于这个工作表现了积极热情的态度，产生了不少优秀的作品。这就说明，写作并不是什么神秘的事，只要敢想敢说敢做，加上刻苦学习、钻研的精神，任何人都是能够写作的。不少革命回忆录的作者，过去都是从来没有搞过写作的，但他们在有关编辑的帮助下写出了动人的作品。所以只要打破迷信，大胆写作，一定可以写出好的回忆录来！
