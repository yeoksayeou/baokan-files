    Oil Field Discovered in Tarim Basin
    The first exploratory well drilled by the Tarim Mining Bureau in Yiqiklik, on the northern edge of the Tarim Basin, gushed crude oil on October 9th. The oil column erupting from the ground reached over twenty meters in height, and the gushing crude oil has accumulated into a lake at the well site. Currently, the Tarim Mining Bureau is taking measures to stop the oil gusher. Drilling workers have filled over a thousand bags of sand and soil into the well in recent days, and the gushing force has begun to weaken.
    Yiqiklik is located in the Kuqa Depression in the northern part of the Tarim Basin, where dozens of oil-bearing structures have already been discovered. The oil gushing from the Yiqiklik structure leads people to predict that the Kuqa Depression will be a large oil region.

    塔里木盆地发现油田
    塔里木矿务局在塔里木盆地北沿依奇克里克钻凿的第一口探井，在10月9日喷出原油。喷出地面的油柱达二十多公尺高，喷出的原油已在井场积聚成湖。现在塔里木矿务局正在采取措施制止喷油，钻井职工在最近几天内把一千多袋沙土填入井内后，喷势已开始减弱。
    依奇克里克在塔里木盆地北部的库车洼地，在这个洼地内閤已经发现有几十个储油构造。依奇克里克的构造喷油，人们预料库车洼地将是一个大油区。
