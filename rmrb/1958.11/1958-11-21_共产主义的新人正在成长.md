    Communist New People Are Growing Up
    Hu Keshi
    People are a priceless treasure of the revolutionary cause. To value people, cultivate people, organize people, and give the fullest play to their enthusiasm and creativity is the fundamental reason why our Party's cause has been invincible and unstoppable.
    Our country is in the most magnificent era of leap-forward development in history, and hundreds of millions of working people are creating unprecedentedly huge productive forces and material wealth. It is also in this process that people are undergoing self-tempering and transformation, and millions of communist new people are growing up rapidly. The five thousand representatives attending the Second National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists are the most outstanding among them. This is the most valuable wealth among all the wealth created by the whole Party and the whole people since the Great Leap Forward in our country.
    The prominent characteristic of the spiritual outlook of these young activists is that they are radiating the communist spirit of labor, which is also a major sign of a communist new person. This new spirit will inevitably be promoted most universally and to the highest degree among this generation of young people in our country.
    The communist labor spirit of the young activists is first manifested in establishing a conscious and selfless attitude towards labor. They work wholeheartedly for society without regard to any personal gains or losses. They value the collective, not the individual; work for the cause, not for fame and fortune; compare contributions, not rewards; integrate with the masses, not seek special treatment; and are willing to undertake difficulties, not seek ease. They only regard themselves as the most ordinary laborers, ordinary soldiers fighting for communism, and never demand any special price from society. In the ranks of this National Congress of Young Activists, there is Wei Fengying, who has carried out many technical innovations and often exceeded work quotas, but has always refused to receive extra bonuses. There is Qiu Cai Kang, an iron and steel warrior who fought heroically by the steel furnace, and even when his whole body was burned and his life was in danger, he still kept thinking about tapping the steel. There is Wang Ruheng, a sanitation worker who has made outstanding achievements in diligently and conscientiously cleaning up urban feces for seven years. In their ranks, there are also thousands upon thousands of heroic figures who sacrifice themselves for others, are selfless and forgetful of self, and are not afraid of any dangers. People see the shining light of communist new people in their heroic actions.
    The dauntless creative style and the tenacious spirit of learning and research run through the labor of young activists at every moment, which is another manifestation of the communist spirit of labor. They despise all "foreign authorities" and dare to break through any dogma and superstition; they eagerly pursue all the latest creations. What predecessors have done, they want to do; what predecessors have not done, they also want to do. Jiang Shaofang, who only attended junior high school for a year and a half, succeeded in experimenting with the hybridization of rice and sorghum and the grafting of corn and rice through several years of hard work and research. This completely shattered the bourgeois experts' arguments that "distant relatives cannot be hybridized" and "monocotyledonous plants cannot be grafted," and opened up a new path for plant cultivation. Several ordinary young people in the Steel Research Office of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry created new steel grades "Steel Commander 80" and "Steel Commander 200" in a short period of time, surpassing the trump card held by the United States. In the year of the Great Leap Forward, thousands of young people made many amazing creations in industrial and agricultural production and cultural, scientific and technological fields, sweeping away bourgeois authorities and reaching the world's advanced level. These vivid examples once again show that the young people of our country have inherited the fine traditions of the people of our country and are a new and creative labor force. Young people lack knowledge and experience, which is their weakness. However, under the guidance of the Party, once they grasp the correct direction and arouse soaring energy and a spirit of diligent learning and research, they are brave and able to break through all conservative and backward norms. And in the process of practice, they also cultivate and exercise themselves, greatly increase their knowledge, experience and talents, and better serve the construction of the motherland.
    Among these young activists, there are workers, peasants, soldiers, and educated youth. From them, we can see the new look of the beginning of the integration of mental and physical labor. In the past year, millions of young intellectuals have gone to the countryside and factories to participate in physical labor, and the majority of students have carried out work-study programs and part-work and part-study activities. In production practice, they have learned the skills of labor, learned the fine qualities of the working people, and enriched the theories they have learned. On the other hand, the vast number of young workers and peasants study books while working, engage in scientific research and experiments on a large scale, and have also set off a wave of studying theory and philosophy. In this way, they have begun to become laborers who master cultural science and theoretical knowledge. Countless facts vividly tell us that the combination of learning and labor, the widespread development of versatile activities, the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants, and the intellectualization of workers and peasants, these trends converge to create favorable conditions for gradually eliminating the differences between physical and mental labor, the differences between workers and peasants, and cultivating new people for building socialism and communism.
    From the young activists, we can also see the fine style of honesty and humility. They combine revolutionary enthusiasm with the spirit of seeking truth from facts. They say one thing and do another; they do what they say; they never engage in falsehood and are not superficial. They are good at learning humbly from the masses and are brave in correcting mistakes. These are all the true colors of the communist spirit.
    These excellent qualities that young activists are growing up with are the result of the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, and are the result of the fact that under the leadership of the Party, politics takes command and red flags are raised high, liberating them from the influence and shackles of bourgeois individualism and right-leaning conservatism. Without the teachings of the Party and without collective collaboration, such amazing achievements would not have been possible.
    The fundamental method of our Party in building socialism and communism is to carry out mass movements on a large scale. Chairman Mao said: "Many people discuss, the enthusiasm is high, and the energy is great." Activists are the backbone and shock force of the masses. Our Party has always attached great importance to the role of activists, and has always continuously cultivated, educated, and armed activists, and relied on this force to create powerful mass movements. We have such a vibrant and communist-spirited team of young activists as mentioned above, which sets an example for the vast number of young people and can promote the vast number of young people through their exemplary actions, playing a shock role in all aspects of socialist construction and forming a vigorous mass movement for building socialism.
    The National Congress of Young Activists has opened. This congress is a congress to further stimulate the communist spirit of young people across the country, and a congress to mobilize young people across the country to march towards building socialism and preparing conditions for the transition to communism. At this meeting, we will accept the instructions of the Party Central Committee and meet new combat tasks. We believe that under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, the young people of our country will surely become a heroic shock force for building socialism and communism, and become a new generation of communists who are both red and expert.

    共产主义的新人正在成长
    胡克实
    人是革命事业的无价之宝。重视人，培养人，把人组织起来，最充分地发挥人的积极性和创造能力，这是我们党的事业所以能够无往不胜、所向披靡的根本原因。
    我国正处在历史上最伟大的飞跃发展的时代，几亿劳动人民创造着空前巨大的生产力和物质财富。也就是在这个过程中，人们经受着自我锻炼和改造，千百万共产主义式的新人迅速地成长了起来。出席第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的五千个代表，便是他们当中最优秀的一部分。这是我国大跃进以来，全党全民所创造的一切财富中最宝贵的财富。
    这些青年积极分子的精神面貌的突出特点，就是在他们身上焕发着共产主义的劳动精神，这也正是一个共产主义新人的主要标志，这种新的精神必然会很快地在我国这一代青年中得到最普遍、最高度的发扬。
    青年积极分子们的共产主义劳动精神，首先表现在树立了自觉的忘我的劳动态度，他们一心一意为社会工作，而不计较任何个人得失。他们重集体，不重个人；为事业，不为名利；比贡献，不计报酬；和群众打成一片，不闹特殊；勇于承担困难，不图轻松。他们只把自己看成是最普通的劳动者，是为共产主义而战的普通一兵，而绝不向社会索取什么特殊代价。在这次全国青年积极分子大会的行列中，有多次进行技术革新、经常突破工时定额，但却从来拒绝领取超额奖金的尉凤英。有英勇战斗在钢炉旁，当全身被烧伤、生命垂危的时候，仍念念不忘出钢的钢铁战士丘财康。有七年如一日、勤勤恳恳清除城市粪便而做出优秀成绩的清洁工人王汝恒。在他们的行列中，还有千千万万个舍己为人、公而忘私、不怕任何艰险的英雄人物。人们从他们这种英雄行为中，看到了闪烁着的晶亮的共产主义新人的光芒。
    大无畏的创造风格和顽强的学习和钻研的劲头，贯穿在青年积极分子们每时每刻的劳动中，这是共产主义劳动精神的又一个表现。他们蔑视一切“洋权威”，敢于冲破任何教条和迷信；热烈追求一切最新的创造。前人干过的，他们要干；前人没有干过的，也要把它干出来。只读过一年半初中的蒋少芳，经过几年的刻苦钻研，试验成功了水稻和高粱杂交、玉米同水稻嫁接。这样就彻底打烂了资产阶级专家所谓的“远缘不能杂交”、“单子叶植物不能嫁接”的论点，给植物栽培学开辟了新的道路。冶金工业部钢种研究室的几个普通青年，只用了不长的时间，创造了“钢帅80”、“钢帅200”的新钢种，超过美国所保有的王牌。在大跃进的一年中，成千上万的青年，在工农业生产、文化科学技术方面的许多惊人的创造，横扫了资产阶级权威，达到了世界先进的水平。这些生动事例，再次表明了我国青年继承了我国人民的优良传统，是一支新生的富有创造性的劳动大军。青年知识不足，缺乏经验，这是他们的弱点。但是，他们在党的指引下，一旦掌握了正确方向，激发起了冲天的干劲和刻苦的学习钻研精神，他们就勇于而且能够冲破一切保守落后的规范。并且在实践的过程中，也培养锻炼了自己，大大地增长了知识、经验和才能，更好地为祖国建设服务。
    在这些青年积极分子当中，有工人、农民、士兵，有知识青年。从他们身上，我们可以看到脑力劳动和体力劳动开始结合的新面貌。在过去的一年中，有数以百万计的青年知识分子下乡下厂参加体力劳动，广大学生开展了勤工俭学和半工半读的活动。他们在生产实践中，学会了劳动的本领，学习了劳动人民的优良品质，并且丰富了所学的理论。另一方面，广大工农青年一边劳动，一边学习书本，大搞科学研究和试验，又兴起了学理论、学哲学的热潮。这样，他们就开始成为掌握文化科学和理论知识的劳动者了。无数的事实生动地告诉了我们，学习和劳动相结合，广泛开展多面手的活动，知识分子工农化，工农群众知识化，这几股潮流汇合起来，就为逐步消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，工人和农民的差别，培养建设社会主义和共产主义的新人创造了良好的条件。
    从青年积极分子身上还可以看到诚实和谦虚的优良作风。他们把革命热情和实事求是的精神结合了起来，他们说一不二，说到做到；绝不弄虚作假，浮而不实。他们善于向群众虚心学习，勇于修正错误。这都是共产主义精神的本色。
    青年积极分子正在成长的这些优秀品质，都是党和毛主席教导的结果，都是在党的领导下，政治挂帅，高插红旗，使他们从资产阶级个人主义和右倾保守主义的影响和束缚下解放出来的结果。没有党的教导，没有集体的协作，就不可能有这样惊人的成就。
    我们党建设社会主义和共产主义的根本方法是大搞群众运动。毛主席说：“人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。”积极分子是群众中的骨干和突击队。我们党一向十分重视积极分子的作用，总是不断地培养、教育、武装积极分子，并且依靠这支队伍去造成强大的群众运动。我们有了像上面说的这样一支朝气蓬勃、充满着共产主义精神的青年积极分子队伍，这就给广大青年树立了前进的榜样，并且可以通过他们的模范行动，带动广大青年，在社会主义建设的各个方面发挥突击作用，形成轰轰烈烈的建设社会主义的群众运动。
    全国青年积极分子大会开幕了，这次大会是进一步激发全国青年的共产主义精神的大会，是动员全国青年向建成社会主义和为过渡到共产主义准备条件的进军大会。在这个会上，我们将接受党中央的指示，迎接新的战斗任务。我们相信，在党和毛主席教导下，我国青年一定能够成为建设社会主义和共产主义的英勇突击队，成为又红又专的共产主义的新的一代。
