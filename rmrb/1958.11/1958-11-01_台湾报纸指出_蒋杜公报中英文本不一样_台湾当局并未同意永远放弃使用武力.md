Xinhua News Agency, October 31st, Taipei: The Taiwan "China News" yesterday published a commentary on the Chiang-Dulles talks communiqué, saying that "reading this communiqué carefully... one can see that the conclusion that the Chinese government (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan) has forever renounced the use of force is unfounded."

This Kuomintang-published English newspaper complained of an "unfortunate difference" between the English and Chinese versions of the Chiang-Dulles communiqué. It said that the phrase "not to use force" in the English version "has a great defect in the English diction from the Chinese point of view," because the Chinese version of the communiqué uses "而非凭借武力” (rather than relying on force).

The newspaper was indignant about this error in the English version drafted by the Americans, saying, "I don't know why there is such a difference." It accused the U.S. side of not "faithfully translating into English the Chinese characters actually used in the communiqué."

The newspaper said that after the Chiang-Dulles talks communiqué was published, "the immediate reaction was that Mr. Dulles had tried to forcibly obtain (the non-use of force) guarantee from President Chiang (referring to Chiang Kai-shek)," and "this impression was deepened when American editorial writers and columnists began to welcome this point."

This newspaper expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. side's ulterior motives in its propaganda, saying that "even without considering this unfortunate difference between the Chinese and English versions," even using "the wording of the English version," it cannot be considered that the Taiwan authorities "have forever renounced the use of force."

    台湾报纸指出
    蒋杜公报中英文本不一样
    台湾当局并未同意永远放弃使用武力
    新华社31日讯　台北消息：台湾“中国新闻”昨天就蒋杜会谈公报发表评论说，把这个公报“仔细地读一下，……可以看出那种认为中国政府（指台湾蒋介石集团）已经永远放弃使用武力的结论是没有根据的”。
    这家国民党出版的英文报纸埋怨蒋杜会谈公报的英文本和中文本之间有一个“不幸的差异”。它说，英文本的“不是使用武力”一词“从中国人的观点来看，在英文选辞上有很大缺点”，因为这个公报的中文本这一句用的是“而非凭借武力”。
    对美国人所拟订的英文本中出现的这个差错，这家报纸愤愤地说，“不知道为什么会有这样一种差异”。它指责美方没有把“公报中实际所用的中国字忠实地译成英文”。
    这家报纸说，蒋杜会谈公报发表后“立即的反应是，杜勒斯先生已经设法从蒋总统（指蒋介石）那里强行取得（不使用武力）这种保证”，而“当美国的社论作者和专栏作家们开始对这一点表示欢迎的时候，这种印象就加深了”。
    这一家报纸表示不满美国方面的别有用心的宣传说，“即使除去中英两种文本之间的这种不幸的差异不算”，就用“英文本的那种措辞”，也不能认为台湾当局“已经永远放弃使用武力了”。
