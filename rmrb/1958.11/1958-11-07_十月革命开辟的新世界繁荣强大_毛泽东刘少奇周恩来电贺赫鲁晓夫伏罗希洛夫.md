Xinhua News Agency, November 6th. Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai today sent a telegram to Comrade N. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Comrade K. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, congratulating them on the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:
Comrade N. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Comrade K. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union:
    On the occasion of the forty-first Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, we, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, extend our most sincere and warmest congratulations to you, and through you, to the great Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government.
    For forty-one years, the tremendous impact of the October Revolution on human history has become increasingly apparent, and the new world opened up by the October Revolution has become increasingly prosperous and strong. Since the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries was held in Moscow last year on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, and the historically significant declaration was issued, the world situation has undergone great changes. Over the past year, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become more united and stronger. The workers' movement in various countries has developed more extensively, and the worldwide movement to defend peace, oppose war, strive for national independence, and oppose colonial rule has reached an unprecedented high, while the aggressive forces headed by U.S. imperialism are on their last legs. The people of the world clearly see that the East wind is further prevailing over the West wind. The lifespan of imperialism will certainly not be very long!
    The Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are advancing by leaps and bounds on the road of communist construction. The brilliant achievements made by the Soviet people in the magnificent construction cause have allowed the working people of all countries to see their own happy tomorrow. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the fraternal Soviet people on their labor achievements, and feel joyful and encouraged as if we are witnessing our own achievements.
    The Chinese people and the Soviet people have a deep friendship as close as brothers. The talks between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union in August this year are an important symbol of the further strengthening of this friendship. The Soviet people have consistently provided generous assistance to the construction cause of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have received strong support from the Soviet people in the struggle against the U.S. imperialist occupation of China's territory Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese people express their deep gratitude for this. The Chinese people are determined to fight alongside the Soviet people to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. We strive for peace, but we are also never afraid of war. If the imperialists dare to impose war on our heads, it will only accelerate their complete demise.
    Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship of the socialist camp headed the Soviet Union!
    Long live the great internationalism of Marxism-Leninism!
    Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman of the People's Republic of China
    Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China
    Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
    November 6, 1958, in Beijing

    十月革命开辟的新世界繁荣强大
    毛泽东刘少奇周恩来电贺赫鲁晓夫伏罗希洛夫
    新华社6日讯　毛泽东主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理今天致电苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席尼·赫鲁晓夫同志，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克·伏罗希洛夫同志，祝贺十月社会主义革命四十一周年，贺电全文如下：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席尼·赫鲁晓夫同志，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克·伏罗希洛夫同志：
    在伟大十月社会主义革命四十一周年的时候，我们代表中国人民、中国共产党和中国政府向你们，并且通过你们向伟大的苏联人民、苏联共产党和苏联政府致最诚挚、最热烈的祝贺。
    四十一年来，十月革命对人类历史的巨大影响一天比一天更加明显，十月革命所开辟的新世界一天比一天更加繁荣和强大。自从去年十月革命四十周年各国共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科举行了会议，并且发表了具有历史意义的宣言以来，世界的局势有了很大的变化。一年来，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加团结和壮大。各国工人运动更加广泛的发展，全世界保卫和平、反对战争、争取民族独立、反对殖民统治的运动空前高涨，以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力则日暮途穷。全世界人民清楚地看到，东风正在进一步压倒西风。帝国主义的寿命，决不会很长的了。
    苏联人民，在伟大的苏联共产党的领导下，正在共产主义建设的道路上大踏步地前进。苏联人民在宏伟的建设事业中所获得的辉煌成就，使各国劳动人民看到了自己的幸福的明天。中国人民热烈地祝贺兄弟的苏联人民的劳动成就，并且像看到自己的成就一样，感到欢欣鼓舞。
    中国人民和苏联人民有着情同兄弟的深厚友谊。今年八月中苏两国领导人的会谈是这种友谊进一步加强的重要标志。苏联人民对中国人民的建设事业一贯给予慷慨的援助。中国人民在反对美国帝国主义侵占中国领土台湾和台湾海峡的斗争中，获得了苏联人民有力的支持。中国人民对此表示深切的感谢。中国人民决心同苏联人民一起为维护远东和世界的和平而坚持斗争。我们力争和平，但是，我们也决不害怕战争。如果帝国主义者敢于把战争强加在我们的头上，那只会加速他们的彻底灭亡！
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    马克思列宁主义的伟大国际主义万岁！
