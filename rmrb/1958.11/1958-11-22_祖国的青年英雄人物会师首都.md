    National Youth Heroes Converge in the Capital
    Leading Comrades of the Party Central Committee, Representatives of Democratic Parties and People's Organizations Congratulate the Opening of the Youth Activists' Congress
    Xinhua News Agency, November 21st: The Second National Youth Socialist Construction Activists' Congress opened in Beijing this afternoon.
    The congress received extremely cordial attention from the Party Central Committee. Zhou Enlai and Zhu De, Vice Chairmen of the CPC Central Committee, and Lin Boqu, He Long, and Zhang Wentian, members and alternate members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Nie Rongzhen, Vice Premier of the State Council, attended today's meeting. As they took their seats on the rostrum, the young activists all stood up and cheered, with a storm of applause expressing their warm respect and welcome to the beloved Party and leaders.
    Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a speech at today's meeting on behalf of the CPC Central Committee.
    Vice Chairman Zhu said: "Our great socialist motherland, like the rising sun, is advancing at a revolutionary high speed. The task of the people of the whole country at the present stage is to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and prepare conditions for the future transition from socialism to communism." Vice Chairman Zhu told the young activists: "The 'Great Harmony World' that mankind has longed for for thousands of years, and the communist ideal that communists have struggled for for more than a hundred years, may be realized by your generation."
    Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out: "Building socialism is a great and glorious historical task that requires the hard work of the people of the whole country, and also requires the youth to play a shock role in this great and glorious cause." He encouraged the young activists: "The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao place the greatest hope on you young people. The future of our great motherland is infinitely bright, and your future is also infinitely bright."
    All the young activists accepted these instructions from the Party Central Committee with great excitement and joy. After Vice Chairman Zhu's speech, the audience stood up again and applauded warmly. Liu Xiyuan, the executive chairman of the congress, then called on the young people, saying: "Vice Chairman Zhu has given us valuable instructions. We must transform these instructions into the power of action. Under the leadership of the Party, together with the people of the whole country, we must continue to go all out on all fronts of socialist construction, play a greater role, and make greater achievements. Thank you to the Party Central Committee for your concern."
    Today's congress venue was set in the Beijing Gymnasium. This is the only venue in the capital that can accommodate the victorious gathering of this five-thousand-strong hero team. It was adorned with beautiful new decorations today. On both sides of the entrance to the venue hung two long vertical banners from top to bottom: "Long Live the Great, Glorious, and Correct Chinese Communist Party!" "Long Live the Great Leader and Teacher - Chairman Mao!"
    On a red screen at the entrance of the congress venue, Mao Zedong's famous saying was written in gold letters: "The world is yours, as it is ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and vitality, and are in a period of prosperity, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Hope is placed on you." This was a speech made by Chairman Mao a year ago when he met with Chinese students studying in Moscow. Every young activist attending the congress could see the golden characters on the screen as they entered the venue. Today, they reviewed the leader's instructions and felt infinitely excited and encouraged.
    At the top of the rostrum stood a white full-body statue of our beloved leader Comrade Mao Zedong. This three-meter-high giant statue looked down on the audience. Giant portraits of Party Central Committee leaders such as Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Lin Biao, and Deng Xiaoping were hung on the east and west sides of the rostrum, making the venue particularly beautiful and solemn.
    Five huge red plaques hung at the upper end of the congress venue, on which were written the action slogans of this congress and of the youth of the whole country: "Youths! Strive to accelerate the building of socialism and create conditions for the future transition to communism!" "Youths! Be the shock brigade of socialism and communism!" "Youths! We must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and be ready at any time to contribute everything we have to defend the motherland and defend world peace!" "Pull out the white flags, plant the red flags, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and always maintain the spirit of continuous revolution!" "Study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong's works, master cultural, scientific, and technical knowledge, and be socialist laborers who are both red and expert!"
    The three-story stands inside the gymnasium were filled with young activists from all fronts of the motherland. Today they were all energetic and beaming with joy. These young people, who had received the lofty honor bestowed by the Party and the people for their selfless labor, all had radiant faces and were immersed in an atmosphere of infinite joy and happiness.
    The presidium of the congress consisted of 148 people. In addition to the secretaries and standing committee members of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, and some heads of the League committees of various provinces and cities, there were also steelworkers, mechanical workers, coal miners, construction workers, train drivers, car drivers, textile workers, people's commune chairmen, agricultural production team leaders, air force squadron leaders, artillery platoon leaders, militiamen, salespersons, childcare workers, cooks, feeders, postmen, midwives, street cleaners, tricycle workers, university students, scientists, amateur writers, actors, athletes, doctors, peasant scientists, peasant painters, peasant female singers, and heroic model figures from all fronts.
    Those invited to attend today's congress included heads of various government departments, representatives of various people's organizations, representatives of various democratic parties, and guests from all walks of life.
    At 2:00 p.m., Liu Xiyuan, the executive chairman of the congress and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the League, announced the opening of the congress. The band played the solemn national anthem. Liu Xiyuan said: Three years ago, more than 1,500 young activists represented thousands of outstanding young people across the country, listened to the instructions of the Party Central Committee here, and solemnly assured the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: determined to dedicate their youth to socialism. Facts have proved that Chinese youth are worthy of being loyal children of the Party and Chairman Mao. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, they have achieved brilliant achievements on all fronts.
    Liu Xiyuan said: This congress is a congress to advance towards the complete victory of socialism. We firmly believe that through this congress, we will be able to inspire the youth of our country to be more energetic, more determined, and contribute all their strength to the great cause of socialism and communism.
    Liu Xiyuan finally said: Let us once again assure the Party: Chinese youth will always be the loyal children of the Party and will always be the shock brigade for building socialism and communism.
    Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, Xu Zhizhen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, delivered speeches at the congress today, warmly congratulating the opening of the congress.
    Shen Junru said in his speech: Today I feel very excited and excited. I am an old man over eighty years old, but when I stand with you, I forget my age and add a new force to my whole body. This force comes from you. I believe that this force can not only make an old man become young, but also transform an old society into a new socialist society, and push it all the way to a communist society.
    Shen Junru said: You represent our entire young generation. Among you, we have seen many inventors, advanced workers, model workers, and heroes from all fronts. Your great achievements and heroic deeds have spread everywhere, becoming a model for learning, a spiritual force to encourage all the people, a material foundation for building socialism, and the most reliable guarantee for catching up with and surpassing Britain in a short period of time.
    Xu Zhizhen said in his speech that in the cause of socialist construction, youth is the most active force. Our Party and Chairman Mao place great hopes on the youth, comparing the youth to the sun in the morning and regarding them as the future of the country. The Party and the state are very concerned about the education and training of young people, and have created all favorable conditions to enable young people to grow up healthily in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education. We firmly believe that the youth of our country will never fail to live up to the ardent expectations of the Party and the leader.
    He said: Young workers, in the current great historical period, will, as in the past revolutionary historical periods, play a vanguard and shock role under the leadership of the Party, and become a promoter of socialist construction.
    Xu Zhizhen encouraged the young people, saying: The Communist Party is our great mother and mentor. We must always listen to the Party, and at all times take the interests of the Party and the people as the starting point for observing and handling problems, inherit all the traditions of heroic struggle and high self-sacrifice of the revolutionary predecessors in order to realize the communist ideal, and be determined to train ourselves to become tame tools wholeheartedly serving the Party and the cause of communism, and become reliable successors that the revolutionary predecessors can trust.
    Li Dequan said in her speech: Our young women have broken through the narrow scope of labor left to women by the old society, and further broken the old boundaries between men and women. What young men can do, young women can also do; young men do well, and young women do well; they and young men have become the vanguards in various construction undertakings of the motherland.
    Li Dequan also focused on the importance of collective life and welfare undertakings. She said that in a socialist family, doing a good job in collective life and welfare undertakings is a major event related to people's thinking, production, and life, and has great political significance. I earnestly hope that among the youth, especially our young women, there will be tens of thousands of outstanding cooks, childcare workers, educators, midwives, and various service personnel. Engaging in collective life and welfare work is glorious social labor and a noble cause of serving the people.
    Their speeches won warm applause from the audience.
    At today's congress, the activity of Beijing youth presenting gifts to the congress aroused a climax of joy in the venue. When more than 1,500 Beijing youths, led by 30 pairs of young men and women holding red flags, entered the venue in orderly rows from all sides of the venue, the venue suddenly cheered. The youths presenting gifts carried more than 1,000 models, charts, and physical objects. These are all new achievements created by one million young people in the capital to welcome the opening of this congress. Young workers from the Beijing Iron and Steel Plant brought a model of a five-ton converter, with which they created a new record of producing 108 tons of steel in eight hours a day; a model of a foundry workshop of a farm tool factory, about five square meters in size, was built by young workers of the Beijing Second Construction Company in 55 days. The total area of this workshop is 24,600 square meters. Among these gifts are also high-yield fruits such as Chinese cabbage, radishes, and apples brought by young commune members of suburban people's communes, commercial theory works created by commercial workers, a group of ballet dancers playing swans, and a team of fully armed young male and female militiamen, also participated in the gift-giving ranks.
    Amidst thunderous applause from the audience, Lin Ziying, a female worker from the No. 1 State Cotton Factory, presented a gift list to the presidium of the congress on behalf of the youth of the capital, and read out the congratulatory message from the youth of the capital to the congress.
    Today's opening ceremony ended at 3:30 p.m. The congress will continue tomorrow. (Attached picture)

    中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒、中华全国总工会副主席许之桢、全国妇女联合会副主席李德全，今天在大会上相继致词，热烈祝贺大会的召开。
    沈钧儒在致词中说：今天我感到非常激动和兴奋。我是一个八十多岁的老人了，但是当我和你们站在一起的时候，我就忘记了自己的年龄，全身增加一股新的力量，这股力量是从你们的身上传来的，我相信，这股力量不仅可以使一个老年人变得年青，而且可以使一个旧的社会改造成为一个新型的社会主义社会，一直推向到共产主义社会。
    沈钧儒说：你们代表了我们整个青年一代，在你们中间，我们看到了许许多多发明家，先进工作者，劳动模范和各个战线上的英雄人物。你们的伟大成就和英雄事迹，已经到处传播，成为学习的榜样，成为鼓舞全体人民的精神力量，建设社会主义的物质基础，以及在一个短期间内赶上并超过英国的最可靠的保证。
    许之桢在致词中说，在社会主义建设事业中，青年是一支最活跃的力量。我们党和毛主席对青年寄予了极大的希望，把青年比喻做早晨的太阳，看做是国家的未来。党和国家十分关怀对青年的教育与培养，并且创造了一切有利条件，让青年们能够在德育、智育、体育方面健康地成长起来。我们深信，我国青年决不会辜负党和领袖的这种殷切的期望。
    他说：青年工人在当前的伟大历史时期中，必将像过去各个革命历史时期一样，在党的领导下起到先锋作用和突击作用，成为社会主义建设事业的促进派。
    许之桢勉励青年们说：共产党是我们伟大的母亲和导师。我们要永远听党的话，在任何时候都把党和人民的利益作为观察问题和处理问题的出发点，把革命前辈们为了实现共产主义理想的那种高度的自我牺牲英勇斗争传统，全部继承下来，立志把自己锻炼成为全心全意为党和共产主义事业服务的驯服工具，成为革命前辈所能信赖的接班人。
    李德全在致词中说：我们的女青年们已经冲破了旧社会遗留给妇女的狭小的劳动范围，进一步打破了旧有的男女分工的界限，男青年能干什么，女青年也能干什么；男青年干得出色，女青年干得也很出色；她们和男青年一样成为祖国各项建设事业中的尖兵。
    李德全还着重谈到集体的生活福利事业的重要性。她说，在社会主义大家庭里，办好集体的生活福利事业，是有关人们思想、生产、生活的大事，有着重大的政治意义。我殷切地希望在青年中特别是我们女青年中，能够涌现出成千成万的优秀的炊事员、保育员、教养员、助产士和各种各样的服务人员。从事集体生活福利工作，是光荣的社会劳动，是为人民服务的崇高事业。
    他们的致词博得了会场热烈的掌声。
    今天的大会上，北京市青年向大会献礼的活动，在会场中激起了一次欢乐的高潮。当一千五百多名北京青年，以手执红旗的三十对青年男女为先导，从会场的四面排着整齐的行列进入会场时，会场顿时欢腾起来。献礼的青年们抬着各种模型、图表和实物等共一千多件。这些都是首都一百万青年为迎接这次大会的召开而创造出的新成就。北京钢铁厂青年工人带来了一个五吨转炉模型，他们用这个炉子创造了每天八小时生产一百零八吨钢的新纪录；一个约有五平方公尺大小的农具工厂铸工车间模型，是北京市第二建筑公司青年工人在五十五天内建成的，这个车间的总面积是二万四千六百平方公尺。在这些礼品中还有郊区人民公社的青年社员带来的大白菜、萝卜、苹果等丰产果实，有商业工作者创作的商业理论著作，一群饰演白天鹅的芭蕾舞演员，一队全副武装的男女青年民兵，也参加了献礼的行列。
