Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and Other Units Adjust Work Schedules
Xincai County Steel Workers Well-Fed and Clothed, Steel Production High

According to a report in the Henan Daily: “North wind howls over the Dabie Mountains, the masses’ fervor soars to the sky, warm clothes to wear and enough to eat, steel production rises step by step.” This heroic song fully demonstrates the high morale of the steelworkers of Xincai County, Henan Province, fighting in Huangbai Mountain in Shangcheng, who, under the warm care of the Party and with the vigorous support of the people of the whole county, are facing the cold winter.

In mid-October, the Xincai County Party Committee successively held three enlarged county committee meetings and township party committee first secretary meetings at the battlefront to specifically study and deploy the winter preparation work for the steel army. After half a month of preparation and material transportation, it has been ensured that the steelworkers are well-fed, well-clothed, well-slept, and producing well. As of November 5th, the housing problem of the steel army has been completely solved. In the absence of winter clothing, the communes processed it, and cadres and the masses donated it, so that every steel warrior wore cotton clothes. In terms of food, the current reserve of rice, calculated at an average of 56 jin of grain per person per month, can be eaten until March next year. Various vegetables are also very abundant. In addition to a large number of pickles, green vegetables, and bean sprouts, 400 live pigs, 300 sheep, more than 10,000 jin of meat, and more than 2,200 jin of kelp were transported from Xincai, plus various oils, salts, sauces, and vinegars, truly everything is available. The rest time is now stipulated as eight hours of sleep per person per day, no less than seven hours. It guarantees that workers have plenty of energy to engage in production. These brilliant measures of the Party have greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses. The main reason why Xincai County has done a good job in preparing for the winter for steelworkers is the importance attached to it by the Party Committee. In addition to the three county party secretaries who personally commanded the front line, two additional county party committee members were specifically assigned to focus on the winter preparation work. They organized ten professional teams of more than 1,000 people to transport winter supplies from Xincai over a long distance of 400 li day and night to the foot of Huangbai Mountain in Shangcheng. The support of the people of Xincai County for the steel army is also all-out. The people of Shangcheng County not only supply grain to all the steelworkers in Xincai, but also vacated more than 800 of their warm houses for the steel warriors of the brother county to live in.

    石景山钢铁公司等单位调整作息时间
    新蔡县钢铁战士吃饱穿暖钢铁产量高
    据河南日报消息　“大别山头北风嚎，群众干劲冲九霄，穿的暖来吃的饱，钢铁产量步步高”。这支气概磅礴的歌子，充分表现了河南新蔡县战斗在商城黄柏山的钢铁战士在党的热情关怀和全县人民的大力支援下，虽临寒冬，但斗志昂扬。
    中共新蔡县委，10月中旬在战地先后召开了三次县委扩大会议和乡党委第一书记会议，专门研究部署了钢铁大军的过冬准备工作。经过半月筹备和调运物资，已保证了钢铁工人吃饱，吃好，穿暖，睡好，生产好。截至11月5日完全解决了钢铁大军的住房问题。缺少冬衣，公社就加工，干部和群众又捐献，使钢铁战士个个都穿上了棉衣，在粮食方面，目前储备的大米按每人每月平均吃粮五十六斤计，可吃到明年3月。各种蔬菜也很丰富，除了大批的咸菜、青菜、豆芽外，还从新蔡运来生猪四百头，羊三百只，大肉一万多斤，海带二千二百多斤，加上各色油盐酱醋，真是样样俱全。休息时间现已规定每人每天睡八小时，不得少于七小时。保证了工人有充沛的精力从事生产。党的这些英明措施，大大地激发了群众的干劲。新蔡县钢铁工人过冬准备工作做得好的主要原因是党委重视。除了有三个县委书记亲临前线指挥外，还另派两个县委委员专抓过冬的准备工作。他们组织了一千多人的十个专业队，把过冬物资从新蔡长途跋涉四百华里日夜不息的运到商城黄柏山下。新蔡全县人民对钢铁大军的支援也是全力以赴。商城县人民不仅供应新蔡全体钢铁工人的粮食，还把自己温暖的屋子腾出了八百多间，让给兄弟县的钢铁战士住。
