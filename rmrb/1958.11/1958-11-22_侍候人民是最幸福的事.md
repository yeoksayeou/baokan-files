    Serving the People is the Greatest Happiness
    Sheng Guoping, Representative of the National Youth Activists Congress, Factory Cook

    I am a cook at the Shanghai Tianfu Weaving Factory. When I think that the work I do is serving our class brothers, I feel honored and happy.

    At the age of fourteen, I entered a restaurant as an apprentice. In the old society, people looked down on this profession and ordered me around at will. If I was not careful, I would be beaten by the foreman and called a "little rice turtle." This mental humiliation was a hundred times more painful than not having enough food and clothing.

    After liberation, I became the master of the country, gained political status, and lived a life of plenty, freedom, and happiness. Remembering the source of the water as I drink it, how could I not follow the Communist Party? Later, I joined the Communist Youth League. I gradually understood that although my daily work is just washing vegetables, washing rice, cooking, and wiping tables, it is also an indispensable and important part of building socialism.

    I am wholeheartedly devoted to doing this work well. On weekdays, when the workers are eating, I pay attention to their expressions. I am happy when I see them eating heartily. If anyone frowns and cannot swallow, I feel sad and quickly ask for their opinions. In the summer, I noticed that some female workers were eating less, so I immediately inquired about the reason. It turned out that it was because "it's hot, and after working all day, they can't eat dry rice." So I added some mung bean porridge, red bean porridge, and rice crust soup. In the winter, I heard workers say, "It's really cold, it would be good to have some chili sauce." The next day, I supplied chili sauce. Our factory's workshops are divided into two locations, one of which is far from the kitchen, so I carry meals there every meal. During windy and rainy seasons, the roads near the workshop are flooded to nearly knee-high. Some people told me not to deliver it and let the workers come back to eat. I thought, rather than having the workers wade through the water, it is better for me to wade through the water alone. I insisted on delivering it, taking one step and feeling for the next, staggering, which was very dangerous. When it rained on the way, I took off my clothes to cover the food. Recently, the weather has been getting colder, and although I deliver the food on time every meal, the food is cold, and my heart feels like it's being cut by a knife. How can I ensure that the workers can eat hot food? I racked my brains day and night, and even bumped into people while walking. My wife thought I was sick. My wife helped me research and use waste materials to make a warmer. Some people said, "The warmer is good, but it's too heavy to carry the food." As long as everyone eats well, what does it matter if I carry a little heavier! How can I serve our class brothers and sisters well without putting in effort? How can I be worthy of this glorious position, and how can I feel happiness?

    Some people say that cooking is not a promising job, but they are talking nonsense. Every job is promising, it just depends on how you do it. Some people can make ordinary work extraordinary, while others can make extraordinary work very mediocre. Under the leadership of the Party, I am determined to carry out a technological revolution in cooking. I went to the blacksmith shop to watch blacksmithing. I found that a piece of iron only takes a few minutes to turn white in the furnace. What's the reason? I went to see it several times in a row. The master blacksmith thought I was going to learn blacksmithing, but he didn't know I was there to learn about the furnace. It turns out that they mainly rely on a blower to concentrate the firepower, which saves both time and coal. After returning to the factory, I discussed it with the leaders and used waste materials to make a blower. Now the cooking time is shortened by half, and more than a ton of coal can be saved per month. Later, with the help of my fellow workers, I designed a semi-automatic dishwasher and a semi-automatic sweet potato peeler. Over the course of a year, these small things saved more than 1,600 yuan in expenses. These facts prove that as long as you use your brain, every job can be innovated.

    侍候人民是最幸福的事
    全国青年积极分子大会代表、工厂炊事员　盛国屏
    我是上海天福织带厂的炊事员，一想到我作的这工作是侍候我们阶级兄弟，就觉得又光荣又幸福。
    我在十四岁上就进了酒菜馆当学徒。在旧社会，人们是看不起这个行业的，随便把我呼来喝去。一不小心就受到把头毒打，骂我“小饭乌龟”。这精神上的侮辱远比我生活上吃不饱穿不暖还痛苦百倍。
    解放了，我成了国家的主人，获得了政治地位，过着饱暖、自由、幸福的生活。饮水思源，我哪能不跟着共产党走？后来我又参加了青年团。我渐渐明白，我日常做的虽然只是洗菜、淘米、烧饭、揩桌子等一些普通工作，却也是建设社会主义不可缺少的重要工作。
    我一心一意地要把这个工作做好。平日，当工人们吃饭的时候，我就注意他们的表情。看到他们吃得香甜，我就高兴。谁若皱眉咽不下，我就难过，赶紧去征求意见。夏天的时候，发现有些女工饭量减少，立即去探听原因，原来是因为“天热，劳动了一天，干饭吃不下”，于是我就增加了些绿豆粥、赤豆粥、锅巴泡饭。冬天的时候，听到工人说：“天真冷，有些辣酱吃吃就好了。”第二天我就供应了辣酱。我们厂的车间分在两处，有一处离炊事房较远，我就每顿挑担子送饭。刮风下雨季节，车间附近的马路积水高近膝盖，有人叫我不要送了，让工人回来吃罢。我想与其叫工人们淌水，不如我一人淌水。我坚持送，走一步，摸一步，摇摇晃晃，好不危险。半路下雨了，我就把自己衣裳脱下来盖住。最近天气渐冷，我虽然顿顿准时送到，但是饭菜凉了，心里像刀割一样。怎样能使工人吃到热饭热菜呢？我日夜动脑筋，走路都撞到人身上，爱人还以为我病了。还是爱人帮我一起研究，利用废料做了一只保暖器。有人说：“这保暖器好是好，但挑上饭菜就太重了。”只要大家吃好，我挑重一些，那有什么关系！不出力气怎样能侍候好我们的阶级兄弟姐妹们呢？又怎能对得起这个光荣的岗位，又怎能感觉出幸福来呢？
    有人说炊事工作没出息，他说的可是外行话，什么工作都有出息，单看你怎么作法，有人可以把平凡的工作作得不平凡，有人也可把不平凡的工作作得很庸俗。在党的领导下，我决心在炊事工作大搞技术革命。我到打铁店去看打铁，发现一块铁放进炉子只几分钟就烧得发白，什么缘故？我一连去看了好几次，老师傅还以为我要学打铁，那知我是来学生炉子的。原来他们主要是靠鼓风机，使火力集中，既节省时间又省煤。回厂后就和领导商议利用废料做了只鼓风机，现在烧饭时间短了一半，煤一个月能省一吨多。后来我又在工人同志的帮助下设计了一架半自动洗碗器、一只半自动剥山芋皮器。一年下来，这些零碎事也节省了一千六百多元的支出。这些事实证明：只要动脑筋，样样工作都可以革新的。（编者注：今日的头像和昨日本刊用的两个头像都是阿老同志画的）（附图片）
