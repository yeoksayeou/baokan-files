Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 26th: The "Red Flag" newspaper, the central organ of the Japanese Communist Party, published an editorial today calling on the Japanese working class and all people to further strengthen and expand the struggle to demand the cessation of negotiations to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to abolish this treaty.

The editorial pointed out that the real intention of U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital in revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is to establish a U.S.-Japan offensive and defensive alliance and an anti-communist military alliance led by U.S. imperialism and composed of Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek group, and the Syngman Rhee group. The Kishi Nobusuke government's proposal to amend the "Police Duties Execution Law" is merely a means of realizing this intention.

The editorial said that the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is a major issue concerning the fate of the Japanese nation, and the Japanese people who urgently desire peace, independence, and democracy cannot allow it to happen. The struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" will be an important struggle to deal a decisive blow to Japanese monopoly capital, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and the Liberal Democratic Party, and to shift the direction of Japanese politics.

The editorial pointed out that although the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party have made temporary and partial concessions by treating the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" as an unfinished bill for deliberation, they are conspiring to shift the target of the Japanese working class and the people's anger, attempting to wait for an opportunity to realize their reactionary ambitions again.

"Red Flag" warned that the struggle is still ongoing, and we must not weaken the strength of the struggle simply because the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" has become an unfinished bill for deliberation.

The editorial pointed out that the achievement of the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" was obtained by concentrating the vitality of all movements of the Japanese people. On the basis of this achievement, we must strive to further raise the political awareness of the working class and concentrate the powerful forces of the working class to promote the further expansion of the struggle. This is the key to the victory of the struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the demand for the abolition of this treaty.

"Red Flag" called on the people of Japan to work hard to establish and strengthen joint struggle organizations centered on the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, including all democratic groups, and at the same time develop them into a united front for peace, independence, democracy, and improved living standards.

"Red Flag" called on the people of Japan to bring together the various demands of all strata, such as banning nuclear weapons testing, opposing nuclear armament, demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, opposing the "performance appraisal system," and workers demanding year-end bonuses and wage increases, to urge the Japanese Diet and the Kishi Nobusuke government to realize these demands, so as to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and realize the dissolution of the Diet.

    “赤旗报”号召日本人民进一步扩大斗争
    坚决反对修改日美“安全条约”
    不许岸政府和自由民主党实现反动野心
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日共中央机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本工人阶级和全体人民，进一步加强和扩大要求停止修改日美“安全条约”的谈判和废除这项条约的斗争。
    社论指出，美帝国主义和日本垄断资本修改日美“安全条约”的真正意图是建立日美攻守同盟和以美帝国主义为主的、由日本、蒋介石集团和李承晚集团组成的反共军事同盟。岸信介政府提出“警察官职务执行法修正案”，只不过是实现它们这种意图的一种手段。
    社论说，日美“安全条约”的修改是有关日本民族命运的重大问题，迫切希望和平、独立、民主的日本人民是不能容许它的实现。反对修改“安全条约”的斗争将是给予日本垄断资本、岸信介内阁以及自由民主党以决定性打击，使日本的政治转变方向的重要斗争。
    社论指出，岸信介内阁和自由民主党虽然把“警职法修正案”作为审议未了法案，作出了暂时、部分的让步，但是它们正在阴谋转变日本工人阶级和人民的怒火的目标，企图等候机会，再来实现它们的反动野心。
    “赤旗报”发出警告说，斗争还在继续进行着，我们不能因为“警职法修正案”成为审议未了的法案，就削弱斗争的力量。
    社论指出，反对修改“警职法”斗争的成就是集中了日本人民一切运动的活力而获得的，我们必须在这种成就的基础上，努力进一步提高工人阶级的政治觉悟，集中工人阶级强大的力量来促使斗争更加扩大，这是反对修改日美“安全条约”和要求废除这项条约的斗争的胜利的钥匙。
    “赤旗报”号召日本全国人民努力建立和加强以社会党和共产党为中心的、包括一切民主团体在内的共同斗争组织，同时使它发展成为为争取和平、独立、民主和提高生活水平的统一战线。
    “赤旗报”号召日本全国人民把禁止试验核武器、反对核武装、要求恢复日中邦交、反对“勤务评定制度”以及工人要求发给年终津贴和提高工资等各阶层的各种要求集中起来，促使日本国会和岸信介政府实现这些要求，以便打倒岸信介内阁和实现国会的解散。
