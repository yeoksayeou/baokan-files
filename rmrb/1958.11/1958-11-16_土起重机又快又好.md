Engineer of the Second Construction Company of Jiangxi Province

    Our company undertook a large number of industrial construction tasks this year. In order to get factories into production as quickly as possible, we mobilized the masses to make extensive use of indigenous hoisting methods under conditions of very poor mechanical equipment, and implemented rapid construction on projects such as cotton mills, machinery factories, and steel plants, achieving good results.

    The wooden single-legged derricks, platform derricks, gantry cranes, and A-frame derricks made by indigenous methods can hoist various types of components. The hoisting project of the cotton mill with a lifting weight of 6,700 tons was completed quickly using indigenous derricks, shortening the original planned construction period by two months, and without any quality or safety accidents. Subsequently, on light and heavy industrial factory buildings with a construction area of more than 63,000 square meters in diesel engine factories, tractor factories, etc., indigenous derricks were used to hoist components with a lifting weight of 11,000 tons, and the work efficiency was greatly improved. Later, it was also promoted and applied to civil construction and sluice installation projects, hoisting iron gates weighing 18 tons and steel roof trusses with a span of 24 meters. The widespread use of indigenous derricks has provided extremely favorable conditions for the extensive promotion of prefabricated installation construction and the cross-operation of hoisting and bricklaying, thereby promoting rapid construction. The transformer workshop project of the Jiangxi Motor Factory that we undertook was completed entirely within three days, shortened from the original plan of 60 days. This shows that under the current situation of lacking foreign machinery, the effect of using indigenous machinery for rapid construction is also very large and very good.

    This kind of indigenous derrick is simple to make and easy to use. It is not restricted by regional or technical conditions. As long as there is wood and pulleys and wire ropes, it can be made and used on the spot. The technology is easy to master. Whether it is an ordinary worker or a carpenter, they can learn it immediately. This not only solves general lifting and hoisting problems, but also has advantages that heavy machinery does not have in certain situations. The general production cost of a wooden indigenous derrick is only a dozen yuan, and the tallest bundled single-legged derrick can be made for no more than 500 yuan. Moreover, it is made and used on the spot, and the wood can also be used as building materials after being dismantled. At the same time, it is very adaptable and can be widely used in any project and any place.

    We believe that in the current situation of unprecedented increase in basic construction tasks, increasingly expanded and dispersed construction areas, and lack of foreign machinery, we must develop indigenous machinery, adopt the method of using indigenous materials without foreign ones, from indigenous to foreign, and combining indigenous and foreign methods to carry out rapid construction on a large scale.

    土起重机又快又好
    江西省第二建筑公司工程师　王志伟
    我们公司今年承担了大量工业建筑任务。为了使工厂能尽快投入生产，我们在机械设备很差的情况下，发动群众广泛地利用土法吊装，先后在棉纺厂、机械厂、钢铁厂等工程上，实行快速施工，取得了良好的效果。
    采用土法制作的木质的独脚把杆、台灵把杆、龙门行车、人字把杆，能够吊装各种类型的构件。棉纺厂起重量达六千七百吨的吊装工程，全部采用土把杆，很快地完成了任务，比原计划工期缩短了两个月，没有发生过质量和安全事故。接着在柴油机厂、拖拉机厂等六万三千多平方公尺建筑面积的轻、重工业厂房上，使用土把杆吊装了起重量达一万一千吨的构件，工效又有很大提高。以后，还推广运用到民用建筑和水闸安装工程方面，吊装过十八吨重的铁闸门及二十四公尺跨度的钢屋架。土把杆的广泛被采用，为大量推行预制安装施工和吊装与砌墙交叉作业，都提供了极为有利的条件，从而推动了快速施工。我们承担的江西电机厂变压器车间工程，从原计划六十天缩短至三天内全部完成。这都说明，在目前缺乏洋机械的情况下，采用土机械搞快速施工，效果也是很大很好的。
    这种土把杆，制做简单，使用方便，不受地区和技术条件的限制，只要有木料，配上滑轮钢丝绳就地便可以现制现用，技术容易掌握，普通工也好，木工也好，一学即会。这不仅解决了一般的起重吊装问题，在某种情况下，还具有重型机械所没有的优点。木质土把杆一般制作费用只需十几元，最高大的捆扎式独脚把杆也不过要五百多元就可制作。而且就地做，就地用，木料拆下后，还可当建筑材料使用。同时它的适应性很大，不论任何工程，任何地方都能广泛采用。
    我们认为，在当前基本建设任务空前增大、建筑施工面越加扩大分散、而又缺乏洋机械情况下，我们必须发展土机械，采用无洋用土，由土到洋，土洋结合的办法大搞快速施工。
