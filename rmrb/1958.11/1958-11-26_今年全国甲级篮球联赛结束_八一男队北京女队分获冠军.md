    National Class A Basketball League Concludes This Year
    August 1st Men's Team and Beijing Women's Team Win Championships
    (Our Dispatch) The second round of the 1958 National Class A Basketball League, which began on the 16th in Beijing, held its final twelve games yesterday. With this, the Class A Basketball League for this year has concluded. According to the points earned in the first and second rounds, the "August 1st" Men's Team and the Beijing Women's Team won the men's and women's championships for this year's league.
    In the men's championship battle last night, the "August 1st" team defeated the strong Beijing team by a margin of eighteen points (75 to 57), retaining the league's men's championship. The "August 1st" team played relaxed last night and showed strong fighting spirit. Yu Yuanxu, Cai Jijie, and Wu Zibing, three strong men, grabbed all the defensive rebounds. They were adept at counter-attacks, fast breaks, and screening, and their shooting and free throw accuracy was very high. Wu Zibing seemed to score every time he raised his hand. They kept the Beijing team under pressure for the entire forty minutes. In contrast, the Beijing team played unusually restrained. Their usual sharp fast breaks and tight collective defense were nowhere to be seen, and they seemed helpless in the face of the "August 1st" team's powerful offense. Due to nervousness, they repeatedly missed shots, resulting in a rare and惨 defeat of eighteen points. The Beijing team had never lost in the first round of this year's league and the first seven games of the second round, and there were high hopes that they would win the league championship. Because they lost to "August 1st" last night, they had to settle for second place. The Tianjin men's team defeated the Shenyang Military Region team by a margin of two points in the final period yesterday, rising to third place.
    In the last game of the women's competition last night, the Beijing women's team defeated the "August 1st" team 83 to 68, winning the championship with an absolute advantage of never having lost a single game in the first and second rounds. The "August 1st" women's team, which was the runner-up in last year's league and the first round of this year's league, lost to the Shanghai Red Team and the Beijing team in this final, falling to third place. The Shanghai Red Team, which was third in last year's league, won the runner-up position.

    今年全国甲级篮球联赛结束
    八一男队北京女队分获冠军
    本报讯　16日开始在北京举行的1958年全国篮球甲级队联赛第二循环赛昨天举行了最后的十二场比赛。至此，今年甲级篮球队联赛全部结束。根据第一、二循环中的积分评定，“八一”男队和北京女队分获今年联赛男女冠军。
    在昨晚的一场男子队冠军争夺战中，“八一”队以十八分的优势
  （七十五比五十七）战胜了实力雄厚的北京队，蝉联了联赛男子队冠军。“八一”队昨晚打得放松，斗志顽强。余元煦、蔡集杰和吴自秉三个大汉拿尽了遮板球。打反击，打快攻，掩护切入都得心应手，投篮和罚球命中率很高，吴自秉几乎是举手就进。全场四十分钟一直压住北京队打。相反的，北京队打得异常拘谨，平日的犀利的快攻反击和严密的集体防守，都打不出来了，在“八一”队的强大攻势面前显得束手无策。进攻时，由于紧张屡投不中，以致遭受了输十八分的几年来未有的惨败。北京队在今年联赛的第一循环赛中和第二循环赛的前七场中从未失败过，获得联赛冠军的呼声很高，因为昨晚对“八一”一战失手，只得屈居亚军。天津男子队昨天在决胜期中以二分的优势战胜了沈阳部队队跃居第三名。
    北京女队在昨晚最后一场比赛中，八十三比六十八战胜“八一”队，以在第一、二循环中从未败过一场的绝对优势取得冠军。去年联赛和今年联赛第一循环的亚军“八一”女队，在这次决赛中先后败给上海红队和北京市队，退居第三。去年联赛第三名上海红队夺得亚军。
