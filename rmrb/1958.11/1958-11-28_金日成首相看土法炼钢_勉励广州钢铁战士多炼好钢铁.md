Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 27th: Premier Kim Il-sung and all the distinguished guests of the Korean government delegation, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, Guangdong Province Governor Chen Yu, and others, visited and toured Yuexiu Park, the Shangyou Steel Plant, the Huangpu People's Commune, and the Chinese Export Commodities Fair today afternoon. The Korean military delegation also participated in the visit. The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed by workers, farmers, and citizens during their tour.

Premier Kim Il-sung first arrived at Yuexiu Park, where the annual Chrysanthemum Exhibition was being held. Premier Kim Il-sung was recognized by visitors while he was touring, and people warmly applauded and paid their respects to him. The Premier nodded kindly to the people. Then, the Premier ascended to the top of Yuexiu Mountain and overlooked the city of Guangzhou.

The steelworkers of the Shangyou Steel Plant in the eastern district greeted Premier Kim Il-sung with enthusiastic applause and outstanding steelmaking achievements. The Premier inspected various backyard steelmaking furnaces, including cupola furnaces, tilting furnaces, and reverberatory furnaces. He inquired in detail about the ingredients, blowing, furnace lifespan, and other aspects, and carefully examined the quality of the steel. Premier Kim Il-sung carefully examined the steel samples and repeatedly praised, "Good steel!" The steelmakers immediately presented the steel samples they had produced to the Premier as souvenirs. After accepting the gifts, the Premier earnestly urged the steelworkers: "You must produce more and better steel!"

Premier Kim Il-sung arrived at the Tangxia camp of the Huangpu People's Commune, where a long welcoming line waited for the Premier by the roadside. After the Premier got out of the car, he saw red flags waving in the fields. It turned out that the Huangpu Commune's "Two Turnings and One Transformation" on-site meeting was being held here. The Premier's arrival greatly excited the commune members who were deep plowing the land. Yang Zuosheng, Secretary of the Guangzhou Suburban District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, introduced to the Premier the situation of their deep plowing of the land with ropes pulling plows. The Premier watched with great interest as commune members carried out deep plowing using manpower, animal power, semi-powered, and mechanical means. The Premier also carefully inspected the soil turning situation of the plows pulled by various power sources one by one. Labor models of the commune, Ye Yanbo and Zhong Yanmei, on behalf of the entire commune, presented their labor fruits, bananas, pineapples, oranges, and other southern specialties, to Premier Kim Il-sung.

When Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean guests arrived at the Chinese Export Commodities Fair, the city of Guangzhou was already brightly lit. Here, the distinguished guests spent more than an hour viewing the export commodities.

    金日成首相首先来到了越秀公园，这里正在举行一年一度的菊花展览会。金日成首相正在参观的时候被游人发现了，人们热烈地向他鼓掌致敬，首相亲切地向人们点头。接着，首相登上越秀山顶，俯瞰广州市容。
    东区上游钢铁厂的钢铁战士们以热烈的掌声和优异的炼钢成绩来迎接金日成首相。首相巡视了各种土法炼钢的冲天炉、点头炉和反射炉。他详细地询问了配料、吹炼、炉子寿命等情况，并仔细观看了钢的质量。金日成首相仔细看了钢的样品，他连声夸奖说：“好钢啊！”炼钢的人们马上把自己炼出来的钢的样品送给首相留作纪念。首相接受了这礼物以后，谆谆嘱咐钢铁战士们：“要更多地炼出好钢铁！”
    金日成首相来到了黄埔人民公社的棠下营，长长的欢迎队伍在路旁等候首相。首相下车后，只见田间红旗招展，原来这里正在举行黄埔公社“两翻一改”现场会议，首相的到来使正在深翻地的社员万分兴奋。中共广州市郊区委员会书记杨左生向首相介绍了他们用绳索牵引拖犁深耕土地的情况。首相以浓厚的兴趣观看社员们用人力、畜力、半动力和机械进行深耕。首相还仔细地逐一观看了用各种动力牵引拖犁翻土的情况。公社的劳动模范叶焰波、钟燕妹代表全社把他们的劳动果实香蕉、菠萝、柳橙等南方特产送给了金日成首相。
