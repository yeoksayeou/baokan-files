Xinhua News Agency, November 12th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japan's Kyodo News Agency published a commentary on the 10th, stating that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan's basic line, from revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to amending the Constitution, has taken on a special color in the Japanese public opinion's reaction to this basic line because the executor is Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. The Japanese people have not forgotten that Nobusuke Kishi was a member of Tojo's wartime cabinet and a war criminal.

The commentary pointed out, "The oppressive measures taken by the Nobusuke Kishi government since the incident of the work performance rating system, combined with his revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and amendment of the Constitution, have left a deep impression on the minds of the people, inevitably reminding them of pre-war politics."

The commentary stated that some people in the Japanese political world already believe that the Nobusuke Kishi government, surrounded by enemies, is in a situation "almost identical to the state of the Yoshida cabinet in its final stages." The news agency pointed out that within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the voices of the "anti-mainstream faction" criticizing Nobusuke Kishi and others are also gradually rising, and figures in the financial and business world also believe that if the Nobusuke Kishi government "does not promote politics that can gain more agreement from the people, the impasse it faces can be said to be very serious."

The Nobusuke Kishi government and the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party, under attack from both inside and outside the party, are making every effort to mend the internal and intra-party rifts in order to "unite them."

The commentary, after discussing Nobusuke Kishi's activities to win over Ichiro Hatoyama and others to help him clean up the mess, pointed out, "Nobusuke Kishi's distressed expression cannot be concealed." The commentary also expressed dissatisfaction with the Nobusuke Kishi government's unscrupulous methods in its eagerness to revive Japanese militarism. It pointed out that "the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives in the general election in May this year and has faced the current crisis in less than half a year since its establishment under the banner of establishing a long-term stable regime." It believes that this is due to problems with the "political methods" of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, but it did not point out that this crisis is the inevitable result of the Nobusuke Kishi government's pursuit of militarist policies.

The commentary pointed out that if the Socialist Party decides to adopt a tougher attitude at the extraordinary congress held on the 12th, then the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet's situation will be even more difficult.

    日本共同社承认
    岸信介四面楚歌处境困难
    政府和自由民主党首脑力图弥补内部裂痕
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本共同社在10日发表评论说，日本执政党自由民主党从修改日美“安全条约”到修改宪法这样一条基本路线，由于执行者是岸信介首相，所以日本舆论对这一基本路线的反应也带上了特殊的色彩。日本人民并没有忘记，岸信介曾经是东条战争内阁的阁员和战犯。
    评论指出，“岸信介政府自从发生勤务评定制度的问题以后所采取的高压手段，同他修改日美安全条约和修改宪法联系起来，已经在国民的心里留下了深刻的印象，不能不使国民联想起战前的政治。”
    评论说，日本政界已经有人认为，陷于四面楚歌的岸信介政府“目前的情况简直同吉田内阁末期的状态相仿佛”。这家通讯社指出，执政党自由民主党内“反主流派”批评岸信介等的呼声也逐渐高涨，金融实业界人士也认为，岸信介政府“如果不推行更能得到国民的一些同意的政治的话，它碰到的僵局可以说是非常严重的。”
    处在党的内外夹攻下的岸信介政府和自由民主党的首脑正在竭力弥补政府内部和党内的裂痕，要使他们“团结起来”。
    评论在论述了岸信介所进行的拉拢鸠山一郎等出来帮他收拾局面的活动以后指出，“岸信介的苦恼的神色是掩盖不住的。”评论对岸信介政府为了急于复活日本军国主义而不择手段的做法也表示不满。它指出，“岸信介内阁在今年5月的大选中获得众议院的多数席位，并且打着建立长期稳定政权的招牌堂哉皇哉地成立以来还不到半年，就碰到了目前这样的危机。”它认为这是由于岸信介内阁“推行政治的方法”有问题，但是它没有指出这种危机是岸信介政府推行军国主义政策的必然结果。
    评论指出，如果社会党在12日举行的临时大会决定采取更加强硬的态度，那么，岸信介内阁的处境将更加困窘。
