Tangerines grown in the south usually appear on the market in late autumn and early winter, but the children of the Michurin Group at Yitian Elementary School in Minhou, Fujian Province, can harvest tangerines in May and June. They grafted two kinds of tangerine trees, which changed the tangerines: the branches are smooth and thornless, the leaves and fruits do not fall, the ripening period is advanced, the fruits have fewer seeds and more pulp, are sweet and delicious, and can meet export requirements. At the exhibition, there was a large glass bottle filled with many golden fruits, which were the results of the children's labor in production—June Tangerines.

    六月柑
    生长在南方的柑子，一般是秋末冬初上市，但福建省闽侯艺田小学米丘林小组的小朋友们，能在五、六月就采摘柑子。他们把两种柑树进行嫁接，就使柑子变了样，树枝光滑无刺，不落叶，不落果，成熟期提早，果实核少浆多，甜蜜可口，能达到外销要求。在展览会上，有一个大玻璃瓶子，装着许多颗金黄色的果实，这些就是小朋友们在生产劳动中的成果——六月柑。
