Xinhua News Agency, 29th: "Labor that benefits the people is noble labor." This idea permeated the speeches of several young activists at the National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists today. They are cooks, salespeople, sanitation workers, nursery workers, midwives, and rickshaw pullers. The outstanding achievements of these excellent young people in ordinary labor can truly be described as stars twinkling, shining brilliantly.

Xiong Caiyun, a young woman from the Youth Experimental Farm of Lemma People's Commune in Shangqiu County, Henan Province, spoke at the conference today as a cook, but four months ago, she was the deputy director of this Youth Experimental Farm.

The cook in the canteen of this Youth Experimental Farm was originally a well-to-do middle peasant who was dissatisfied with socialism and full of resentment. As a result, he was dismissed, and the farm selected several other young people to replace him. However, some young people felt that cooking was unpromising and unrewarding, and they were unwilling to do it. As a result, six cooks were replaced in four days. At this time, Xiong Caiyun took the initiative to ask the Party branch to become a cook, and the Party agreed to her request and sent someone to take over her work.

The deputy director becoming a cook was opposed by Xiong Caiyun's family. Her mother scolded her as a "silly girl," and her grandfather said she was "like a mulberry sapling that can't grow into a tree," and refused to acknowledge her as a granddaughter. But Xiong Caiyun's determination was very firm.

Four female cooks prepare meals for 107 people a day, which is quite a heavy workload. However, Xiong Caiyun and her female companions constantly studied hard and have now achieved hot soup and steamed buns with four dishes every meal, changing in nine different ways every three days. Everyone eats happily, and the attendance rate has reached 100%. The masses constantly praise them.

"Communist Youth League members should endure hardship first and enjoy benefits later, go to the place where the Party needs them most, and do the work that others are unwilling to do!" Xiong Caiyun mentioned these words taught to her by the Party in her speech today, and this is the purest thing that fills Xiong Caiyun's heart.

An ordinary salesperson, because of her love for her work and constant study of theory, was able to raise her sales experience to the philosophical level and give a vivid explanation. This is the main reason why the speech of Qiao Shuhua, a female salesperson from the Seventh Department Store in Harbin, attracted attention at today's conference.

"Salespersons should not only have a good service attitude, but also have the ability to grasp customer psychology." Based on this belief, Qiao Shuhua has explored some very valuable experience in her work. She once, according to the law of the universality and particularity of contradictions, in addition to being familiar with the general psychological situation of customers, also carefully analyzed the personality of customers, divided customers into three categories, and then took different ways to receive them, as far as possible to meet customer requirements. She also enthusiastically helped customers choose goods according to their different occupations, ages, figures, and skin colors. She also tried to make customers feel good about the goods and know what was good when introducing goods to them as much as possible. Sometimes, if some customers could not buy what they needed in the store, she would try to bring similar goods to introduce to them. If the customer did not need them, she would write down the customer's address and notify them when the goods arrived. Because Qiao Shuhua adopted these practices, customers were very satisfied, and she formed close friendships with many customers.

Wang Ruheng, a young sanitation worker in Shanghai, has been a manager in a public toilet for seven years since he was sixteen years old. Because of his outstanding achievements in ordinary work, the Party and the people gave him great honor, and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League also awarded him the honorary title of "Youth Assault Team Member of 1958."

Wang Ruheng's speech today introduced what kind of thinking has made him feel at ease in this job for a full seven years. He once made a detailed calculation of the cost of his labor. He thought: more than 5,000 people are received in the toilet every day, which is more than 150,000 people per month, and 7.2 million people have used this toilet in four years, which means that working in the toilet for four years can serve every citizen of Shanghai once. The more he thought about it, the more interesting and energetic he became, so he loved this job even more.

The model deeds created by Wang Ruheng in the management of the toilet are very moving. He once lay on the ground and wiped with his hands, knocked with a hammer, and scraped with a knife, removing thirty pounds of old dirt and scrubbing the dirtiest and smelliest toilet clean. Several times, people who used the toilet accidentally dropped things they were carrying into the cesspool, and he would reach in with his hands to retrieve them and send them to their homes. Wang Ruheng has now been transferred to do the work of pushing manure carts and dumping manure buckets, and he is doing equally well in his new position.

Wang Ruheng has a view of the work he loves. He said: "As long as it is work needed by the people, as long as it is indispensable work in social life, no matter how smelly or dirty it is, it is promising and glorious." He also said: "As long as a person's thinking is not smelly, he will never be smelly."

It was somewhat unexpected that there was a male nursery worker who spoke at today's conference. This young man, who is less than twenty years old, is named Wang Shimin and comes from the Rocket People's Commune in Dali County, Shaanxi Province. This young man, from initially thinking that being a "child minder" was something that people without prospects did, now realizes that any ordinary thing, as long as it is needed for the cause of communism, is glorious and promising. His process of ideological transformation shows that the Party's education has blossomed and borne fruit in this young man's heart. Wang Shimin firmly stated in his speech today: "We must take good care of the children!"

Zhou Junqun, an eighteen-year-old Zhuang nationality health worker, introduced at the meeting today her moving deeds of settling down to health care work and benefiting Zhuang women. She is a health worker at the Datang Health Center in Yongning County, Guangxi, and has been working in the rugged and difficult mountainous areas to deliver babies for Zhuang women since 1956. In the past two years, no matter day or night, or whether it was windy or rainy, as long as there was a sick woman, she would be there at any time, diligently serving the mothers. In these two years, she has rescued more than a dozen dystocia women and more than one hundred children.

"I am happy when mothers and children are safe, and I vow to be a red and expert midwife." Zhou Junqun expressed such a beautiful wish in her speech.

Three young people from remote areas of the motherland also spoke at today's conference. They have dedicated their youth to the construction of the motherland's border areas, overcome various difficulties, and established their own labor paradise.

Wei Fushen, a representative from the Chahan Wusu Youth Collective Farm in Haixi, Qinghai Province, reported on the moving scenes of their border life in the past three years in his speech entitled "We Have Deeply Fallen in Love with Qinghai." In January 1956, more than a thousand young men and women responded to the Party's call, formed the first youth reclamation team in Henan Province, and left their hometowns and relatives to go to the Qinghai Plateau in the great northwest of the motherland. After three years of hard work, their total grain output has increased from 150,000 jin in the first year to 1.25 million jin this year, achieving the requirement of 1,000 jin of grain per person. With the development of production, their lives have also been greatly improved.

The speeches of Ji Genjian, a member of the Tianjin Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team in Luobei County, Heilongjiang Province, and Yang Guozhen, secretary of the Party Committee of the Huadianba Reclamation Farm in Dali County, Yunnan Province, also vividly described the glorious deeds of the young people in building a beautiful home on a barren land in the border areas of the motherland.

At today's conference, some young exploration workers also reported on their heroic achievements in fighting against nature. They are: Ma Cheng (joint speech), Deputy Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Chuanzhong Mining Bureau of the Sichuan Petroleum Administration, Feng Zhiqiang (joint speech), a young representative of the Qinghai Qaidam Geological Exploration Team, Zhao Hongquan, a representative of the 505 Petroleum Prospecting Youth Assault Team of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, and Yang Yude, a young technician of the Jingtieshan Geological Team in Gansu Province.

Zhao De'an, a young commander of a certain unit of the People's Air Force, who commanded an air battle on the southeast coast front, reported at the conference today the deeds of him and his comrades-in-arms in bravely annihilating enemy aircraft. On July 29, they shot down and wounded three enemy aircraft in just two minutes. From January to September this year, their squadron destroyed and damaged a total of seven enemy aircraft. Lu Hua'e, a militia representative from Shangsi County, Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi, and Feng Shixuan, a militia representative from Qinbei Zhuang Autonomous County, Guangdong Province, reported in a joint speech the process of their close cooperation with the People's Liberation Army to capture all three of the Kuomintang agents sent by Taiwan, including Huang Kexiang, who were parachuted in within 24 hours.

At the conference held this afternoon, more than 1,000 youth representatives from central state organs presented gifts to the conference. When this gift-giving team entered the venue under the guidance of dozens of red flags, the whole venue burst into cheers. The gift-giving youths brought five white balloons hanging huge slogans, which rose in the four corners and the center of the venue. They also brought many models, objects, and charts. The gift-giving youth representatives also recited enthusiastic dedications to the conference.

A total of twenty-one people spoke at today's conference. Among them are Li Yonghua, Secretary of the Temporary Committee of the Communist Youth League of Wangfujing Hongqi Street in Beijing, Sheng Zaitang, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Ant Island People's Commune in Putuo County, Zhejiang Province, He Yongzao, a rickshaw puller in Nanjing, Pan Zhengrong (Miao nationality), Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of Jinping County, Guizhou Province, Cao Tianyou, Deputy Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of Zhangye Prefecture, Gansu Province, Wang Wugui, a young representative of the Jinggangshan Comprehensive Reclamation Farm in Jiangxi Province, and Awang Duoji, a member of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Federation in Tibet.

The conference will continue tomorrow.

### 对人民有益的劳动　就是高尚的劳动  青年积极分子在普通劳动中做出了光辉的成绩

    对人民有益的劳动　就是高尚的劳动
    青年积极分子在普通劳动中做出了光辉的成绩
    新华社29日讯　“对人民有益的劳动，就是高尚的劳动”，今天全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上好几位青年积极分子的发言中，都贯串着这种思想。他们是炊事员、售货员、清洁工人、保育员、接生员和三轮车工人。这些优秀的青年在普通劳动中做出的出色成绩，真可以说是如同群星闪烁，光彩耀人。
    河南省商丘县勒马人民公社青年试验场的女青年熊彩云，今天以炊事员的名义在大会上发言，但是四个月以前，她还是这个青年试验场的副场长。
    这个青年试验场食堂里的炊事员原来是一个富裕中农，这个人因为对社会主义不满，满肚子怨气，结果被撤了职，场里另外选派了几名青年去接替，可是有些青年又嫌做饭没出息，吃力不讨好，不愿意干，结果四天换了六个炊事员。这时，熊彩云就主动向党支部要求当炊事员去，党同意了她的要求，并且派人接替了她的工作。
    副场长去当炊事员，这件事遭到熊彩云一家人的反对，妈妈骂她是“傻妮子”，爷爷说她是“桑树乘子长不成树”，不承认她这个孙女。但是熊彩云的决心很坚强。
    四个女炊事员，一天做一百零七个人的饭，这个工作是够繁重的。然而熊彩云和她的女伴们不断地苦心钻研，现在已经做到顿顿热汤热馍四个菜，三天九变样，大家吃得高高兴兴，出勤率达到百分之百。群众不断地表扬她们。
    “共青团员要吃苦在前，得利在后，要到党最需要的地方去，要干人家不愿干的活！”熊彩云今天在发言里提到党所教导她的这几句话，这就是充满在熊彩云的心灵里的最纯洁的东西。
    一个普通的售货员，由于热爱自己的工作，不断地钻研学习理论，居然能把售货经验提高到哲学的水平上作了一番生动的解释。这是哈尔滨市第七百货商店女营业员乔淑华在今天大会上的发言所以引人注意的主要原因。
    “售货员不仅要有良好的服务态度，而且要有掌握顾客心理的能力。”乔淑华本着这样的信念，在工作中摸索到一些很宝贵的经验。她曾经根据矛盾的普遍性和特殊性的规律，除了熟悉顾客的一般心理情况外，还仔细分析顾客的个性，把顾客分为三类，然后采取不同的方式来接待他们，尽可能满足顾客的要求。她又根据顾客的职业、年龄、身材、肤色的不同，热心地帮助他们挑选商品。她还设法在向顾客介绍货物时，尽可能让他们对商品发生好感，并且知道好在什么地方。有时，有些顾客在商店里买不到所需要的东西，她就尽量把类似的商品拿来向顾客介绍。如果顾客不需要，她便把顾客的地址记下来，货来时再通知他们。由于乔淑华采取了这些做法，顾客都很满意，她和许多顾客结成了亲密的朋友。
    上海市青年清洁工人王汝恒，从十六岁起，七年来一直在一个公共厕所里当管理员。由于他在平凡的工作中做出了出色的成绩，党和人民给予他很大的荣誉，共青团上海市委还赠给他以“1958年青年突击手”的光荣称号。
    王汝恒今天的发言里介绍了是怎样一种思想使他安心于这个工作整整七年。他曾经为自己劳动的代价算过一笔细账。他想：每天在厕所里要接待五千多人，一个月就是十五万多人次，四年就有七百二十万人次上过这个厕所，这就是说，在厕所里工作四年，就可以为每一个上海市民服务一次。他越想越有意思，越想越有劲，因此就更加热爱这个工作。
    王汝恒在管理厕所的工作中，所创造的模范事迹，十分令人感动。他曾经趴在地上用手擦，用鎯头敲，用刀子刮，清除了三十斤老垢，把这个最脏最臭的厕所擦洗得干干净净。有几次，上厕所的人身上携带的东西，不小心掉到粪坑里，他便用手伸进去掏，找出来还送到人家家里。王汝恒现在已被调去做推粪车、倒粪桶的工作，在新的岗位上，他同样做得很出色。
    王汝恒对他所热爱的工作有一种看法。他说：“只要是人民需要的工作，只要是社会生活中不可缺少的工作，不管它有多么臭，多么脏，都是有出息的，都是光荣的。”他又说：“一个人只要思想不臭，是永远不会臭的。”
    在今天大会上发言的有一个男保育员，这是多少有些出乎人们的意料的。这个不到二十岁的男青年名叫王世民，是从陕西省大荔县火箭人民公社来的。这个小伙子从开始时认为当“娃娃头”是没出息的人干的事，到现在认识到任何平凡的事，只要是共产主义事业的需要，就是光荣，就有出息。他的这个思想转变的过程，说明了党的教育在这个年轻人的心里开了花，结了果。王世民今天在发言中坚决表示：“一定要把孩子带好！”
    十八岁的僮族保健员周俊群今天在会上向大家介绍她安心保健工作，为僮族妇女造福的动人事迹。她是广西邕宁县大塘卫生所的保健员，从1956年开始就一直奔波在崎岖难行的山区为僮族妇女接生。两年来，她不论白天黑夜，也不管刮风下雨，只要一有病妇，都是随叫随到，勤勤恳恳地为产妇服务。在这两年中，她一共急救了十多个难产妇和一百多个小孩。
    “母子平安我心喜，誓做红专接生员。”周俊群在发言中表达了这样的美好的愿望。
    今天在大会上发言的，还有三位来自祖国边远地区的青年。他们把青春献给祖国边疆的建设事业，战胜了各种困难，建立了自己的劳动乐园。
    来自青海省海西察汗乌苏青年集体农庄的代表魏富申，以“我们深深爱上了青海”为题，在发言中报告了他们三年来边疆生活的动人情景。1956年1月，他们一千多名男女青年，响应党的号召，组成了河南省第一支青年垦荒队，离别了故乡和亲人，奔上祖国大西北的青海高原。经过三年奋战，他们的粮食总产量已由第一年的十五万斤达到了今年的一百二十五万斤，实现了每人千斤粮的要求。随着生产的发展，他们的生活也有了很大的改善。
    黑龙江省萝北县天津青年志愿垦荒队队员纪根建、云南省大理县花甸坝垦荒农场党委书记杨国珍两人的发言，也生动地描述了青年们怎样在祖国边疆的一片荒芜的土地上建设起美丽家园的光荣事迹。
    在今天的大会上，还有一些青年勘探工作者报告了他们跟大自然作斗争的英雄业迹。他们是：四川省石油管理局川中矿务局团委副书记马成（联合发言），青海柴达木地质勘查队青年代表冯志强（联合发言），新疆石油管理局五○五石油普查青年突击队代表赵鸿铨，甘肃省镜铁山地质队青年技术员阳裕德。
    东南沿海前线一次空战的指挥者——人民空军某部青年指挥员赵德安，今天在大会上报告了他和他的战友们英勇歼灭敌机的事迹。7月29日，他们只用了两分钟，就击落、击伤了三架敌机。从今年1月到9月，他们这个中队一共击毁击伤敌机七架。广西僮族自治区上思县民兵代表陆化俄和广东省钦北僮族自治县的民兵代表冯仕宣今天在联合发言中，报告了他们密切同解放军配合，在二十四小时内全部捕获台湾国民党派遣的空降特务黄科祥等三人的经过。
    在今天下午举行的大会上，一千多名中央国家机关的青年代表向大会献礼。这支献礼队伍在数十面红旗引导下进入会场时，全场卷起了一片欢腾。献礼的青年们带来了悬挂着巨幅标语的五个白色大气球，在会场的四角和中央升起，他们还带来了许多模型、实物和图表。献礼的青年代表还向大会朗诵了热情洋溢的献词。
    在今天大会上发言的共有二十一人。他们之中还有北京市王府井红旗大街共青团临时委员会书记李永华，浙江省普陀县蚂蚁岛人民公社共青团团委书记盛再棠，南京市三轮车工人何永藻，共青团贵州省锦屏县委员会书记潘正荣（苗族），共青团甘肃省张掖地委副书记曹天祐，江西省井冈山综合垦殖场青年代表王武桂，西藏拉萨爱国青年联谊会会员阿旺多吉。
    明天大会将继续举行。
