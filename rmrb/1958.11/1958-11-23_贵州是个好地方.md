Guizhou is located on a plateau with complex terrain. Towns and terraced fields are distributed on hills and small basins, forests and vegetation cover the mountain slopes, and many rivers flow tirelessly through narrow and deep valleys. Due to the mild climate and abundant rainfall, it is suitable for plant reproduction. Almost all the crops grown throughout the country can be found here. And the special local products of the mountainous areas are even more famous throughout the country, accounting for one-third of the total annual income of farmers. Jinping County has fir trees that mature in eight years, and the saying "previous generations plant trees, later generations enjoy the shade" is no longer applicable here. The rare Eucommia ulmoides tree, which can treat high blood pressure and extract high-grade rubber, is found all over the mountains and slopes of Zunyi Prefecture, Guizhou. Cork, known as soft wood, is an important resource in industry. This kind of tree is abundant in northwestern Guizhou. The cork of Weining Yi, Hui and Miao Autonomous County is up to five centimeters thick, and its quality ranks first in the country.

The mountainous and rainy environment brings endless hydropower resources to Guizhou. According to preliminary surveys, the main rivers alone can generate 22 to 25 million kilowatts of electricity, and the remaining tributaries can generate another 5 million kilowatts.

Guizhou Province is particularly rich in mineral resources. Dozens of metallic and non-metallic minerals have been discovered, including iron, coal, copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, mercury, phosphorus, manganese, potassium, antimony, etc., most of which are non-ferrous metals and rare metals.

Every county in the province has coal and iron. In many places in Guizhou, you can dig up what the masses call "black gold" (coal) with just a little digging. The total coal reserves in the province are increasing as the geological departments investigate, and have now reached 200 billion tons. In terms of iron ore, according to preliminary calculations, the industrial reserves of the Zunyi iron ore alone are 4.6 billion tons, and the prospective reserves reach 10 billion tons.

Guizhou is also a treasure house of non-ferrous metals. The reserves of aluminum ore rank first in the world.

Mercury, also known as quicksilver, is produced in more than 40 counties in Guizhou, and its output also ranks first in the world. Manganese and phosphorus are abundant and of good quality in Guizhou. Every year, a large amount of ferromanganese is supplied to Anshan, Shanghai and other places for steelmaking industry, and the rich phosphorus ore provides Guizhou with inexhaustible fertilizer. In the past, people thought that Guizhou had no oil. However, in recent years, more than 200 oil and gas shows have been discovered in Guizhou, with more than 80 oil-bearing structures. In some places, crude oil is found when limestone is tapped.

Of course, the above-ground and underground resources of Guizhou are far more than these, and the development work has only just begun. With the rapid development of socialist industrial construction, more and more resources are being discovered and developed, and the 16 million people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Guizhou are increasingly in love with their hometown. Filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, they proudly sing praises of Guizhou:

　　"No three sunny days," the rain is over and the sky is clear again,
　　The climate is warm and the rainfall is sufficient, a good harvest every year.
　　"No three miles of flat land," gold is everywhere,
　　Railways are being built and factories are being set up, construction is new every day.
　　"No three cents of silver per person," the revolution is even more firm,
　　Soaring energy plus drilling energy, completely dig up the roots of poverty.

### 贵州是个好地方

    贵州是个好地方
    贵州地处高原，地形复杂。在丘陵、小盆地上分布着城镇和梯田，在山坡上复盖着森林和草木，许多河流穿过窄而深的河谷，经年不息地奔流。由于气候温和，雨量充沛，适合植物繁殖。全国各地所生长的农作物，差不多在这里都有。而山区的土特产在全国更为出名，价值相当农民全年总收入的三分之一。锦屏县有八年成材的杉树，“前人栽树后人乘凉”的说法在这里已经不适用了。能治高血压、又能提炼高级橡胶的稀有的杜仲树，贵州遵义专区满山满坡都有。被称作软木的栓皮，是工业上的一种重要资源。这种树，在贵州西北部是很多的。威宁彝族回族苗族自治县有的栓皮厚达五公分，质量在全国数第一。
    多山多雨给贵州带来无穷的水力资源，据初步勘测，单是几条主要河流就可以发电二千二百至二千五百万瓩，其余的支流还可以发电五百万瓩。
    贵州省的矿藏尤为丰富。现已发现的金属与非金属矿，有铁、煤、铜、铝、铅、锌、汞、磷、锰、钾、锑等几十种，其中大半是有色金属和稀有金属。
    全省县县有煤有铁。在贵州许多地方，只要稍微挖一挖，几乎都可以挖到群众说的“乌金”（煤）。全省煤的总储量，地质部门愈查愈多，现在已达两千亿吨。在铁矿方面，据初步计算，仅遵义铁矿的工业储量就有四十六亿吨，远景储量达一百亿吨。
    贵州又是有色金属的宝库。铝矿蕴藏量，占世界第一位。
    汞，又叫水银，在贵州有四十多个县出产，产量也居世界第一位。锰和磷在贵州更是又多又好，每年都有大量锰铁支援鞍山、上海等地炼钢工业，丰富的磷矿为贵州提供了取之不尽的肥料。过去，人们认为贵州没有石油。可是，几年来在贵州发现的油气苗已达二百多处，储油构造八十多个。有的地方一敲开石灰岩就发现原油。
    当然，贵州地上地下的资源，远远不止这些，开发工作也仅仅是开始。随着社会主义工业建设的飞跃发展，越来越多的资源被发现和开发，贵州山区一千六百万各族人民也越来越爱上了自己的故乡。他们满怀着革命的热情，自豪地歌颂贵州说：
    “天无三日晴”，雨过又天青，
    气候温暖雨量足，年年好收成。
    “地无三里平”，遍地是黄金，
    又修铁路又办厂，建设日日新。
    “人无三分银”，革命更坚定，
    冲天干劲加钻劲，彻底挖穷根。
