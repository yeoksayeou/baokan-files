Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, 25th Dispatch: To express their determination to strive for self-determination, the Greeks on the island of Cyprus held a twenty-four-hour general strike on the eve (November 24th) of the UN General Assembly Political Committee's debate on the Cyprus issue. In Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, female students also took to the streets to demonstrate and fought with the police of the British colonial authorities.

According to an announcement made by the "Struggle for Cyprus" organization on November 22nd, in October alone, patriots on the island carried out more than two hundred ambushes against British colonial army vehicles. In early November, British air force personnel were killed and injured in an incident at the British air force base in Nicosia.

The heroic resistance of the Cypriot people has made the British colonialists extremely nervous. On November 10th, the British colonial air force authorities dismissed three thousand Cypriot workers working at the British air force base and hurriedly recruited personnel from Britain to replace them. On the same day, the colonial army authorities also announced the dismissal of Cypriots working in British military catering facilities throughout Cyprus.

At the same time, the Cypriot people also hope to resolve the Cyprus issue through political means. On September 22nd, in response to the British partition plan, Cypriot Archbishop Makarios put forward a proposal to make Cyprus an independent country after a period of autonomy. This proposal has been supported by the Cypriot people, the Greek government, and the people. The Greek representative's proposal to the UN General Assembly Political Committee on November 24th to resolve the Cyprus issue was based on this suggestion.

The Cypriot people's struggle against British colonial rule has received widespread support from British progressives. The left-wing forces, led by the Communist Party, advocate that the British government stop the bloody suppression in Cyprus and reopen negotiations with Cypriot representatives on the basis of Makarios's proposal. However, the British government remains unrepentant on this point. According to reports, on the eve of the UN discussion of the Cyprus issue, the British colonial army also launched a large-scale military suppression operation in the western region of the island, and announced on November 22nd that it had arrested another fourteen Cypriots.

### 不向武装镇压低头　坚决要求民族自决  塞浦路斯人民反英斗争日益激烈

    不向武装镇压低头　坚决要求民族自决
    塞浦路斯人民反英斗争日益激烈
    据新华社25日讯　尼科西亚消息：塞浦路斯岛上的希腊人为争取自决正在进行着越来越激烈的斗争。为了表示他们争取自决的决心，塞浦路斯岛上的希腊人在联合国大会政治委员会开始辩论塞浦路斯问题的前夕（24日）举行了二十四小时的总罢工。在塞浦路斯的首府尼科西亚，女学生还到街上举行游行示威，并且同英国殖民当局的警察展开了搏斗。
    据“为塞浦路斯而斗争”组织在11月22日公布，仅在10月份，这个岛上的爱国者就对英国殖民军的车辆进行了二百多次伏击。11月上旬，在尼科西亚的英国空军基地还发生了英国空军人员被炸死和炸伤的事件。
    塞浦路斯人民的英勇抵抗已经使得英国殖民主义者感到草木皆兵。英国殖民空军当局在11月10日解雇了在英国空军基地上工作的三千名塞浦路斯工人，并且急忙到英国招募人员来顶替他们的工作。同一天，殖民陆军当局还宣布解雇在塞浦路斯各地英军饮食机构工作的塞浦路斯人。
    同时，塞浦路斯人民也希望通过政治途径来解决塞浦路斯问题。塞浦路斯大主教马卡里奥斯在9月22日针对着英国的分治计划，提出了一项使塞浦路斯经过一段自治时期成为一个独立国家的建议。这个建议提出以后得到了塞浦路斯人民、希腊政府和人民的支持。希腊代表11月24日向联合国大会政治委员会提出的解决塞浦路斯问题的提案就是以这个建议为基础的。
    塞浦路斯人民反对英国殖民统治的斗争得到了英国进步人士的广泛支持。以共产党为首的左翼力量主张英国政府停止在塞浦路斯的血腥镇压，并且在马卡里奥斯建议的基础上同塞浦路斯代表重开谈判。但是，英国政府却对这一点执迷不悟。据报道：就在联合国讨论塞浦路斯问题的前夕，英国殖民军还在这个岛上的西部地区采取大规模的军事镇压行动，并且在22日宣布又逮捕了十四名塞浦路斯人。（附图片）
