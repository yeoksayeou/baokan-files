The most remarkable action of the October Socialist Revolution of 1917 was the declaration of a completely new type of relationship between all nations. This relationship is based on the recognition of the true equality of all nationalities, the recognition of the right of each country to independent development, and the opposition to annexation, plunder, or the ambition of some countries to seize the territory of other peoples. After the establishment of the world's first worker-peasant state, the Soviet government immediately announced the abolition of the secret treaties signed by the Tsarist government with other powers. These treaties stipulated Russia's participation in the great powers' plunder and exploitation of other countries. The young Soviet Republic immediately abolished all unequal treaties with other countries. This gave the first blow to the imperialist colonial system that oppressed all nations.

The new principles of international relations proclaimed by the October Revolution were most fully reflected in the further development of relations between the peoples of countries embarking on the road of socialist development. Common goals, brotherly cooperation in socialist construction and the struggle to defend peace, unite the peoples of the socialist camp in a friendly family. In terms of unity and strength, the socialist camp is far superior to the imperialist camp. The ever-strengthening friendship of the peoples of the socialist countries has become a great force in the new world.

The fraternal relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are the most obvious manifestation of an unwavering and ever-consolidating friendship. Every new step brings Soviet-Chinese relations closer and closer. The trade volume between our two countries is growing year by year, and economic cooperation in industry, transportation, and agriculture is constantly expanding. In the past year alone, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have signed many new and very important agreements to expand economic ties and exchange experiences in science, culture, and cadre training.

While friendly cooperation between countries is expanding, contacts between the public of the Soviet Union and China are also constantly expanding through friendship associations, writers, trade unions, and many other organizations.

This is how the ties between our two great peoples are expanding and strengthening. This is how the peoples of the Soviet Union and China are marching hand in hand, united towards one goal—building a communist society. Our mutual cooperation promotes our accelerated leap forward, and close friendship strengthens our mutual strength and the strength of every country in the socialist camp. No force can shake the unity and friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China. This unity and friendship is the main foundation of the unity and power of the socialist camp.

The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China was forged in history with the blood of our two peoples in the common struggle against foreign aggressors. Our people and the Chinese people have many things in common in the difficult days of the past. There are also many things in common in the revolutionary struggles of the two peoples. All this brings our two peoples especially close.

If the great October Revolution gave impetus to the Chinese revolution, then, on the other hand, all progressive and revolutionary elements in old Russia followed the development of the Chinese revolutionary struggle with great interest and sympathy. After the victory of the October Revolution in 1917, Lenin and our people placed the greatest hope in the Chinese revolution, believing that this revolution would add new and tremendous strength to the cause of socialism's victory over capitalism. This force will finally destroy the imperialist colonial system.

The enthusiastic sympathy of Chinese progressive activists for Soviet Russia was already evident in the first few months of the Soviet regime's existence. Sun Yat-sen, the great revolutionary democrat of China, pointed out the necessity of "the revolutionary parties of China and Russia uniting and fighting together" in a telegram to Lenin in 1918.

After the victory of the Russian October Socialist Revolution, the young Soviet Republic consistently advocated developing friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, and a popular movement to strive for friendly alliance with our country was widely launched within China. This movement became an integral part of the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal liberation struggle.

The powerful upsurge of the Chinese revolutionary movement formed under the influence of the October Revolution restrained the forces of Japan and other aggressors in the Soviet people's struggle against foreign interventionists and White bandits, thereby giving great assistance to the young Soviet state in difficult times. The people of Northeast China directly assisted the Soviet people in the struggle against foreign interventionists and White bandits. By the time the Far Eastern Republic was established, there were already 30,000 guerrillas in Northeast China. These guerrillas were in contact with Bolshevik underground organizations and Russian Far Eastern guerrillas. Thousands of Chinese workers living in Russia joined the Red Army and guerrillas. Nearly 40,000 Chinese volunteers fought with weapons for the Soviet regime.

The victory of the Chinese revolution cleared all obstacles on the road to a brotherly alliance between the great peoples of China and the Soviet Union. The proclamation of the People's Republic of China marked a new stage in Sino-Soviet relations.

On February 14, 1950, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and many supplementary agreements were signed in Moscow. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and agreements marked a new stage in the development of friendly political, economic, and cultural ties between the two great neighbors. The principles of Lenin—equality, mutual respect for national interests, fraternal mutual assistance, non-interference in internal affairs, and unlimited loyalty to the cause of proletarian internationalism—are the foundation of this treaty.

All subsequent relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have been developed to further consolidate the fraternal ties, cooperation, and friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China.

Not long ago, the meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in Beijing once again emphasized the complete unanimity of our two peoples and the two Communist Parties on all basic issues of modern times. This meeting once again demonstrated the unbreakable friendship between these two great socialist countries.

The Soviet people give a high evaluation to their friendship with the Chinese people. Every Soviet person constantly feels a heart-to-heart connection with the Chinese people. We have a common goal, a common cause—building a communist society and ensuring world peace.

The Soviet people admire the heroism of the Chinese people. The Chinese people are making great leaps forward on the road of socialist construction, overcoming enormous difficulties. The Soviet people feel heartfelt joy for the rapid growth of industry, the development of agriculture, the success of the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the rapid development of the cultural revolution of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet Union has consistently given comprehensive assistance to the People's Republic of China. Our people do not regard this merely as assistance, but as fulfilling their internationalist obligations.

The friendship between our two great peoples and their peace-loving policies are the main foundation of the forces for peace against imperialist aggression. Faced with the combined strength of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the military provocations of US imperialism in the Far East are inevitably doomed to complete failure. The US aggressors must get out of Chinese territory. This is not only the firm demand of the Chinese people but also of the Soviet people. Let the US imperialists understand clearly: if they provoke a war against China, then the Soviet people will join their brothers—the Chinese people—in giving the aggressors a devastating blow.

The friendship and solidarity of the peoples of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the socialist camp drive the imperialists crazy. They are willing to invest any capital to sow discord among us. They are very clear: the unity of the socialist countries makes the socialist camp invincible.

Monopoly capital takes two main means to ensure all its rule, its staggering profits, the exploitation of working people, the plunder of colonies and underdeveloped countries. This is, on the one hand, using violence, and on the other hand, creating divisions, antagonism, and directly provoking some workers' groups against other workers' groups, peasants against workers, one nation and country against another nation and country. All religious, national, and professional prejudices, bribery, intimidation, and instigation are for these purposes.

Capitalists could not maintain their position by violence alone if they did not use every means to divide the workers. "Divide and rule" can be said to run through the entire domestic and foreign policy and tactics of the imperialists. The entire history of capitalist development, its development into imperialism, is a struggle against the working class and its political organizations and trade union organizations. Colonial rule, wars under the direction of imperialism, their entire diplomatic activity is full of incidents and artificial divisions, quarrels, provoking some working people's groups and countries against other working people's groups and countries. In order to carry out such conspiracies, the imperialist bourgeoisie trains its many political, diplomatic cadres and secret agents. Reformists, opportunists, and revisionists who split the working class, working people, and the solidarity of persecuted progressive workers also serve these purposes of the capitalists.

Even after the final victory of the October Socialist Revolution in our country, there were still many conspiracies from the right-wing and left-wing elements who acted as agents of imperialism. They undermined the unity of the victorious people and infiltrated our ranks in order to turn the country towards the road of capitalist development. But, as everyone knows, the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party abandoned from their path all those who tried to hinder the building of socialism.

In order to achieve the goal of splitting the socialist camp, the imperialists placed great hope in the Yugoslav revisionists. The Yugoslav revisionists attempted to split and undermine relations between socialist countries. But, as is well known, these attempts by the Yugoslav revisionists were completely defeated, and the hopes of the imperialists were dashed.

The imperialists' attempt to overthrow the Hungarian people's regime, as well as the Yugoslav revisionists' program of openly opposing the socialist camp's propositions, did not weaken but further strengthened the friendship of the socialist camp countries and increased the vigilance in our ranks.

Despite the defeats suffered by the imperialists, they do not give up and use all possible conspiracies to undermine the unity of the socialist camp countries. But these conspiracies are destined to fail. There is not and cannot be such a force that can destroy the friendship and rock-solid unity of the peoples of the Soviet Union and China and the other socialist countries that are marching towards one goal and engaged in a common cause.

Our friendship will surely continue to strengthen!

### 中苏两国伟大人民牢不可破的永恒友谊

    中苏两国伟大人民牢不可破的永恒友谊
    苏联苏中友好协会理事会主席　安·安·安德烈耶夫
    1917年十月社会主义革命最卓越的行动之一，是宣布了完全新型的各国人民的关系。这种关系所赖以建立的基础是：承认各民族的真正平等，承认每一个国家有独立自主的发展权利，反对兼并、掠夺或一些国家侵占别国人民领土的野心。在世界上第一个工农国家成立以后，苏维埃政府立即宣布废除沙皇政府同其他列强签订的秘密条约。在这些条约里曾规定俄国参加列强对其他国家的掠夺和榨取。年青的苏维埃共和国立即废除了对其他国家的一切不平等条约。这就给压迫各国人民的帝国主义殖民体系以第一个打击。
    十月革命所宣布的国际关系新原则，也在走上社会主义发展道路的各国人民之间的关系的进一步发展中，得到了最充分的反映。共同的目标、在社会主义建设和保卫和平斗争中的兄弟般合作，把社会主义阵营各国人民团结在一个友好的大家庭里。从团结和力量的强大来看，社会主义阵营大大地优于帝国主义阵营。日益加强的社会主义国家人民的友谊，变成了新世界的伟大力量。
    苏联和中华人民共和国的兄弟般关系是毫不动摇的、越来越巩固的友谊的最明显的表现。每一个新的步骤都使苏中两国关系越来越密切。我们两个国家的贸易额一年一年地在增长，工业、运输和农业方面的经济合作在不断扩大。仅最近一年来，苏联和中华人民共和国之间就为了扩大经济联系和交流科学、文化和训练干部方面的经验而签订了许多新的、非常重要的协定。
    在国家之间友好合作越来越扩大的同时，苏中两国的社会公众的联系也通过友好协会、作家、工会和其他许多组织不断地扩大了。
    我们两国伟大人民的联系，就是这样地在扩大和加强。苏中两国人民就是这样并肩携手、团结一致地走向一个目标——建成共产主义社会。我们的互相合作，促使我们加速向前跃进，而亲密的友谊则在增强我们彼此的力量和社会主义阵营每一个国家的力量。没有任何力量能够动摇苏中两国人民之间的团结和友谊。这种团结和友谊是社会主义阵营国家的团结和威力的主要基础。
    苏联和中华人民共和国的伟大友谊，在历史上是我们两国人民在反对外国侵略者的共同斗争中以鲜血凝成的。在我国人民和中国人民过去的艰难的日子中有许多共同点。在两国人民的革命斗争中也有许多共同点。这一切都使我们两国人民特别接近起来。
    如果说伟大的十月革命给了中国革命以推动力，那末，从另一方面说，旧俄的一切进步和革命的分子都以极大的兴趣和同情关注中国革命斗争的发展。1917年十月革命胜利后，列宁和我国人民对中国革命寄以最大的希望，认为这个革命一定会给社会主义战胜资本主义的事业增添新的巨大力量。这种力量将最后摧毁帝国主义殖民体系。
    中国进步活动家对苏维埃俄国的热烈同情，在苏维埃政权存在的最初几个月就已经表现出来了。中国伟大的革命民主主义者孙中山，在1918年致列宁的电报中就指出“中俄两国革命党团结一致，共同奋斗”的必要性。
    俄国十月社会主义革命胜利后，年青的苏维埃共和国一贯主张发展中国同苏联之间的友好关系，而中国内部也广泛开展了争取同我国友好同盟的人民运动。这个运动成为中国人民反帝反封建的解放斗争的组成部分。
    在十月革命影响下形成的中国革命运动的强大高涨，在苏联人民反对外国干涉者和白匪军的斗争中，牵制了日本及其它侵略者的力量，从而对于处在困难时期的年青的苏维埃国家给予了巨大的援助。中国东北的人民，在反对外国干涉者和白匪军的斗争中，直接援助了苏联人民。到远东共和国成立时，中国东北已经有三万名游击队。这些游击队同布尔什维克地下组织和俄国的远东游击队都有联系。成千名居住在俄国的中国劳动者参加了红军和游击队。近四万名中国志愿人员，手执武器为苏维埃政权而斗争。
    中国革命的胜利清除了中苏两国伟大人民走向兄弟般同盟道路上的一切障碍。中华人民共和国宣告成立，标志着中苏关系的新阶段。
    1950年2月14日在莫斯科签订了苏中友好同盟互助条约和许多补充协定。苏中条约和协定的签订，标志着两个伟大邻邦之间友好的政治、经济和文化联系发展的新阶段。列宁的平等、互相尊重民族利益、兄弟般互助的原则，彼此不干涉内政，无限忠于无产阶级国际主义事业是这个条约的基础。
    苏联和中华人民共和国以后的一切关系，都是为了进一步巩固苏中两国人民兄弟般联系、合作和友谊而发展起来。
    不久以前，苏联和中华人民共和国的领导人在北京的会谈，再一次强调了我们两国人民和两国共产党在现代一切基本问题上的意见完全一致。这次会谈再一次显示了这两个伟大社会主义国家的牢不可破的友谊。
    苏联人民对自己同中国人民的友谊给予崇高的评价。每一个苏联人都经常感觉到同中国人民有心心相印的联系。我们有一个共同目的，一个共同事业——建成共产主义社会和确保世界和平。
    苏联人民赞美中国人民的英雄主义。中国人民在克服巨大的困难，在社会主义建设的道路上大跃进。苏联人为新中国的工业迅速增长、农业发展和农业社会主义改造的成功以及中华人民共和国文化革命的迅速发展而感到衷心的喜悦。苏联始终如一地给人民中国以全面的援助。我国人民不认为这仅仅是一种援助，而是在尽自己的国际主义义务。
    我们两国伟大人民的友谊及其爱好和平的政策，是反对帝国主义侵略势力的和平力量的主要基础。在苏联和人民中国的联合力量面前，美帝国主义在远东的军事挑衅不可避免地要遭到完全失败。美国侵略者必须从中国领土上滚出去。这不仅是中国人民而且也是苏联人民的坚决要求。让美帝国主义者切实地明了：如果他们对中国挑起战争，那末，苏联人民将同自己的兄弟——中国人民一起给侵略者以毁灭性的打击。
    苏联、人民中国和社会主义阵营其他国家人民的友谊和团结一致，使得帝国主义者发狂。他们不惜投入任何资本来对我们进行挑拨离间。他们非常清楚：社会主义国家的团结一致，使社会主义阵营成为不可战胜。
    垄断资本采取两种主要手段来保证自己的一切统治、自己的惊人利润、剥削劳动人民、掠夺殖民地和不发达国家。这就是一方面是用暴力，另一方面用制造分裂、对立和直接挑拨一些工人团体对另一些工人团体、农民对工人、一个民族和国家对另一个民族和国家的关系。一切宗教的、民族的和职业的偏见、贿买、恫吓和挑拨都是为了这些目的。
    资本家如不是利用一切手段来分裂劳动者，而光是靠暴力是维持不了他们的地位的。“分而治之”可以说是贯穿在帝国主义者整个内外政策和策略上。资本主义发展的全部历史，它的发展为帝国主义，就是反对工人阶级及其政治组织和工会组织的斗争。殖民统治、在帝国主义指使下的战争，他们的全部外交活动充满着事件和人为的分裂、争吵、挑拨一些劳动人民团体和国家反对另一些劳动人民团体和国家。为了进行这样的阴谋活动，帝国主义资产阶级训练自己的许多政治、外交干部和特务间谍。分裂工人阶级、劳动人民和被迫害的进步工人团结的改良主义者、机会主义者和修正主义者也为资本家这些目的服务。
    甚至在十月社会主义革命在我国最后取得胜利以后，还有不少来自起着帝国主义代理人作用的右派和左派分子方面的阴谋。他们破坏胜利了的人民的团结，并且打入我们的队伍，以便把国家转向资本主义发展的道路。但是，大家知道，在共产党领导下的苏联人民从自己的道路上抛弃一切企图妨碍建设社会主义的人。
    为了达到分裂社会主义阵营的目的，帝国主义者对南斯拉夫修正主义者寄以极大希望。南斯拉夫修正主义者企图分裂和破坏社会主义国家之间的关系。但是，如所周知，南斯拉夫修正主义者的这些企图遭到彻底失败，而帝国主义者的希望也破灭了。
    帝国主义者推翻匈牙利人民政权的企图，以及南斯拉夫修正主义者用它的纲领公开敌视社会主义阵营的主张，不仅没有减弱，反而更加加强了社会主义阵营国家的友谊，并且提高了我们队伍中的警惕性。
    尽管帝国主义者遭到失败，他们并不放弃而且用各种可能的阴谋来破坏社会主义阵营国家的团结。但是，这些阴谋注定要遭到失败。没有也不可能有这样一种势力，能够破坏苏中两国人民以及走向一个目标、从事一个共同事业的其他社会主义国家人民的友谊和磐石般的团结。
    我们的友谊一定会不断地加强！
