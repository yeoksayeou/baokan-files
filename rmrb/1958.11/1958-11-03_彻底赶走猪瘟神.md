　　Thoroughly Drive Away the Swine Fever Demon

　　Half of the counties in the country being able to eradicate swine fever and send away the great plague god in just over six months is a miracle in ancient and modern history, both in China and abroad.

　　Is the achievement we have made in eradicating swine fever small? It is not small. Is it enough? It is not enough. At present, the provinces that have eradicated swine fever account for only a little more than one-third of the country's provinces and regions, and the counties that have eradicated swine fever now account for only half of the country's more than two thousand counties. This is why we say it is not enough.

　　Early winter is the season when swine fever begins to spread, and the work of eradicating swine fever will enter a tense stage again. How are the areas that have eradicated swine fever preparing to consolidate the achievements they have obtained? What new plans do the areas that have not yet eradicated swine fever have? Now is the time to make concrete arrangements for the work.

　　If half of the counties could eradicate swine fever in the first half of the year, how could the swine fever demon not be driven out of the country's pigpens in another half year and let it ascend to heaven sooner? We expect this wish to become a reality soon.

### 彻底赶走猪瘟神

    彻底赶走猪瘟神
    全国一半的县，能在短短半年多里消灭猪瘟，送走大瘟神，这是古今中外历史上的奇迹。
    我们在消灭猪瘟上取得的成绩小不小呢？不小。够不够呢？不够。现在消灭猪瘟的省只占全国各省区的三分之一多，现在已经消灭猪瘟的县只有全国两千多个县的一半。我们所以说不够的理由就在这里。
    冬初是猪瘟开始流行的季节，消灭猪瘟工作又将进入一个紧张的阶段。已经消灭猪瘟的地区准备怎样巩固已得到的成就？还没有消灭猪瘟的地区，又有什么新的计划？现在已经到了具体安排工作的时候了。
    在上半年里能有一半的县消灭猪瘟，在又一个半年里怎么不能把猪瘟神赶出全国的猪圈，让它早升天界呢？我们期待着这个愿望很快成为现实。
