    Mistaking the Station for the Airport

    On October 26th, the People's Daily published news on page four about the delegation of the Polish People's Republic arriving in the Soviet Union. The headline stated that Khrushchev and Gomulka delivered speeches at the airport, but the news content stated that Gomulka went to Moscow by special train, and Soviet party and government leaders were present at the station to welcome him. The leaders of the Soviet and Polish countries delivered speeches at the station. The editor was careless and mistakenly wrote "station" as "airport." I hope you will pay attention to eliminating the phenomenon of the title not matching the text in the future.

    车站错成机场
    10月26日人民日报第四版刊载了波兰人民共和国代表团抵苏的新闻，标题说赫鲁晓夫和哥穆尔卡在机场发表谈话，可是新闻内容却是哥穆尔卡乘专车去莫斯科，前往车站迎接的有苏联党政领导人，苏波两国领导人在车站发表了谈话。编辑同志粗心大意，竟将“车站”搞成“机场”了。希望你们今后注意消灭题文不符的现象。
