    After completing their missions in China, the Soviet geological scientists have returned to their homeland. However, the staff of the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences still frequently talk about them. Whether during intense work or during leisure time, many reasons, things, and scenes touch them, reminding them of the experts' selfless assistance, profound friendship, and hard-working spirit towards China's geological science.

    Back in 1956, Academician Betechtin, a Soviet geological scientist, saw that China urgently needed to develop mineral deposit science and manganese ore development and research. The Soviet Academy of Sciences sent the renowned experts Suslov and Antoshenko and his wife to the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to help with their work and brought many mineral phase and manganese ore specimens, pictures, and materials. The two experts helped the Institute of Geology establish a mineral phase laboratory from scratch, greatly promoted the research work on manganese ore, and held two training courses. They also helped train graduate students at ordinary times. They would modify the graduate students' study plans word by word. When talking to students, they always made full preparations, first drafted the manuscript, and revised it several times before talking. When others asked them for advice, they often did not reply immediately but made an extremely responsible reply after careful study and consideration. Once, Suslov was invited to give a report on manganese ore, and he repeatedly wrote the manuscript three times. One day, he prepared until 2:00 in the morning, and he even had to wake his wife up from bed to give him comments on his manuscript. They worked overtime almost every night in their tents when they went to the field. Every time they returned to the tent after going up the mountain for investigation and research, they also gave reports to the local geological exploration team, answered questions, and identified ore specimens. This year, Antoshenko went to the Lushan area of Henan to work. One day, she returned from the mountain to her residence at 8:00 or 9:00 in the evening. After eating dinner and attending a meeting, it was almost 12:00 midnight. At that time, some exploration teams and ore-seeking masses wanted to report the situation to her. The Chinese geologists who worked with her tried hard to persuade her to rest, but the expert herself, regardless of fatigue, insisted on listening to the report and answering the questions raised by the exploration team and the masses that night.

    Professor Sinitsyn, an expert in geotectonics, arranged the time that should have been used for rest on the train when working in the field. After getting off the train, he devoted all the available time to work, truly achieving "every second counts." Before returning to his country in 1956, he had just finished his field investigation. He immediately used the two days on the train from Beijing to Manchuria to sort out the investigation materials and send them to the Geological Institute for application.

    Academician-Correspondent Vlasov and Professor Beus, geologists, during their one-and-a-half months of field work in China, refused to eat Western food in order not to trouble the reception staff and to integrate with Chinese friends. They often ate Chinese food with Chinese comrades, and sometimes when Western food was prepared for them, they raised objections. When they worked in the deep mountains, it was more troublesome to supply fine grains and non-staple foods, so they took the initiative to ask for potatoes and sweet potatoes as their meals. Recently, when the two of them went to work in the Northeast, they stayed overnight in a farmer's house. The two of them slept on the same kang (heated brick bed), and because their bodies were too long, their feet were exposed outside the kang, so they had to turn sideways and sleep along the kang. They not only did not complain about this uncomfortable life, but jokingly said to the Chinese scientists working with them: "We two are like getting married."

    Professor Lebezhikov, a Soviet expert on natural salt who came to China in early August to help investigate and study salt lakes in the Qaidam Basin, was an elderly person who was afraid of cold and wind and also had an illness. In order to help China develop its natural resources, he came to China immediately after recovering from his illness, not afraid of hardships, and regardless of his personal health, he worked in the Qaidam Basin for more than two months. Together with Chinese scientists, he worked in the Asatu area, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level, braving strong winds and heavy snow. The air pressure there was very low, and he was often suffocated and unable to breathe. The roads in the salt lake area were rugged and uneven, and it was very bumpy to ride a horse or take a car. Professor Lebezhikov suffered from duodenal disease, and he would feel pain when he was shaken, but he still persevered in his work with Chinese scientists. His spirit of linking with reality is also very worthy of learning. Every time he went to a place, the first thing he considered was how to make his scientific research quickly promote production. He had a considerable understanding of the scientific problems that needed to be solved in China's production and construction, and he paid special attention to discovering and studying the mineral resources that China lacked. For example, for a certain mineral, he pointed out important clues for finding ore. He told Chinese scientists: Wherever there is this kind of mineral, there is an indicator plant. This is very helpful for us to explore and develop this kind of mineral that the country urgently needs in the future. He discovered mirabilite ore next to a highway in a certain place. He knew that this was a resource that China needed and lacked, so he suggested that Chinese scientists pay attention to research and mining.

    The time that Soviet experts worked in China was short and limited, but the impression they left on the Chinese people was profound. Their contribution to China's socialist construction is something that the Chinese people will never forget!

    活跃在深山荒野里的苏联专家
    新华社记者　吕新初
    苏联地质科学家在中国完成了任务以后，已经回到他们的祖国去了。但是中国科学院地质研究所的工作人员还是经常谈论起他们；不论在紧张的工作中或者在公余休息的时候，总会有许多缘由、许多事物和景象触动他们想起专家们对我国地质科学无私的帮助、深挚的友谊以及艰辛踏实的工作精神。
    还是在1956年的时候，苏联地质学家别捷赫金院士看到中国急需发展矿床科学和锰矿的开发、研究工作，苏联科学院便派了著名的专家苏斯洛夫、安特罗申科夫妇来到了中国科学院地质研究所帮助工作，并且带来了许多矿相和锰矿的标本、图片、资料。两位专家帮助地质研究所从无到有地建立了矿相实验室，使锰矿的研究工作大大推进了一步，并且开办了两期训练班，平时还帮助培养研究生。他们对于研究生的学习计划，都要一字一句地修改；同学生谈话时，他们总要充分作好准备，事先起好稿子，并且要修改好几次，然后才谈。别人有问题向他们请教，他们常常不立即答复，而要经过仔细研究考虑后再作出极其负责的答复。有一次，苏斯洛夫被邀请作关于锰矿的报告，他的讲稿反复写了三次，有一天他准备到半夜两点钟，他还要把他的爱人从床上叫起来对他的讲稿提意见。他们出差到野外去，几乎每晚要在帐篷里开夜车。每次上山调查研究后回到帐篷里来，还要给当地的地质勘探队作报告、解答问题和鉴定矿石标本。今年安特罗申科到河南鲁山地区去工作，一天从山上回到住处已经是晚上八、九点钟了，吃了晚饭开过会，已近十二点钟，那时还有一些勘探队和找矿的群众要向她汇报情况，随同她一起工作的中国地质学家努力劝她休息，但是专家自己却不顾疲劳，坚持在当晚听取汇报和解答勘探队和群众提出的问题。
    大地构造专家西尼村教授在野外工作的时候，把应该休息的时间都安排在火车上；下车以后，把可以利用的时间全部用于工作，真正做到了“分秒必争”。1956年他回国前，刚结束了野外调查工作。他立即利用从北京到满洲里的在火车上的两天时间，把调查材料整理出来寄给地质研究所应用。
    地质学家弗拉索夫通讯院士和别乌斯教授在中国一个半月的野外工作中，为了不使招待人员麻烦同时为了和中国朋友打成一片，不肯吃西餐，经常和中国同志一起吃中国饭，有时给他们预备了西餐，他们还要提出反对意见。他们在深山中工作的时候，供应细粮和副食品比较麻烦，他们就主动要求把土豆地瓜当饭吃。最近他们两人去东北工作，晚上借宿农民家里，两人睡在一个炕上，因为身体太长，脚露在炕外，因而只好横过身来顺着炕睡。他们不但不埋怨这种不舒服的生活，反而打趣地对一起工作的中国科学家说：“我们俩人好像结婚一样”。
    8月初来中国帮助调查研究柴达木盆地盐湖的苏联天然盐专家列别希柯夫教授，是一个上了年纪、怕冷怕风、又是有病的人。为了帮助中国开发自然资源，他生病刚好，就立即出差来中国，不怕艰辛，不顾个人的健康，在柴达木盆地工作了两个多月。他和中国科学家一起，在海拔四千多公尺高的阿萨图地区冒着大风大雪工作，那里气压很低，他常常被窒息得喘不过气来。盐湖地区道路崎岖不平，骑马或坐汽车都很颠簸。列别希柯夫教授有十二指肠疾患，一受震动就要疼痛，但是他仍旧和中国科学家一起坚持着工作。他的联系实际的精神也是很值得学习的。他每到一个地方，首先考虑的是如何使他的科学研究迅速推动生产。他对于中国生产建设中所需要解决的科学问题相当了解，他特别注意去发现和研究中国所缺少的矿产资源。例如对于某种矿产，他指点了重要的找矿线索。他告诉中国科学家：凡是有这种矿的地方，都有一种指示植物。这对于我们今后探寻和开发这种国家迫切需要的矿物很有帮助。他在某地公路旁边发现了芒硝矿，他知道这是中国所需要而且缺乏的资源，他就建议中国科学家注意研究开采。
    苏联专家在中国工作的时间是短促的、有限的，但是他们留给中国人民的印象是深刻的，他们对中国社会主义建设的贡献，是中国人民永久不会忘记的！
