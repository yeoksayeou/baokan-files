Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th - The "Washington Post" published an editorial on the 19th, saying that the current political chaos in Japan is a problem that "worries the entire free world" and "will be a source of great unease for the entire free world."

The newspaper expressed concern that the Japanese Socialist Party's struggle to boycott the Diet for a long time in opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" "may, as they hope, lead to the collapse of Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's government." It said, "Indeed, they have greatly damaged Kishi Nobusuke's personal control over the party and the government."

The newspaper is deeply afraid that the Socialist Party's proposition for Japan to implement an independent foreign policy will gain increasingly broad support, and it tries its best to defend Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracy to restore a police state by revising the "Police Duties Execution Law."

However, it had to admit the unpopularity of Kishi Nobusuke's practice of closely following the United States' war policy. It said that in Japan, "the only real problem remains the widespread fear of the revival of dictatorship and military adventures." It is worried that Kishi Nobusuke "has not done enough to quell public fear of Japan's alliance with the United States, nor is it enough to pass his Police Duties Execution Law Amendment with constitutional and other safeguards."

    日本人民反军国主义情绪强烈
    美报担心岸政府要垮台
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：“华盛顿邮报”19日发表社论说，目前日本的政治混乱是一个“使整个自由世界感到忧虑”的问题，并且“将是使整个自由世界感到非常不安的一个根源。”
    这家报纸表示担心，日本社会党为反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”而对国会进行长期抵制的斗争，“可能像他们所希望的那样使岸信介首相的政府垮台。”它说，“的确他们已经大大损害了岸信介个人对党和政府的控制。”
    这家报纸深怕社会党关于日本实行独立的外交政策的主张会得到日益广泛的支持，并且竭力为岸信介企图通过修改“警察官职务执行法”来恢复警察国家的阴谋辩解。
    但是，它不得不承认岸信介所奉行的紧紧追随美国的战争政策的做法的不得人心。它说，在日本，“唯一真正的问题仍然是普遍存在的对独裁和军事冒险的复活的恐惧”。它担心岸信介“所做的工作还不足以平息公众对于日本同美国结成同盟的恐惧，也不足以使他的警察官职务执行法修正案在有宪法保障和其他方面的保障的情况下得到通过。”
