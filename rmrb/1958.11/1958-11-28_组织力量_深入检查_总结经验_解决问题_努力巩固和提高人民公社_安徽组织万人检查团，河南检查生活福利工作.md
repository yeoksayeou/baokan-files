Hefei, November 27th (People's Daily) - The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a telephone conference of secretaries of regional and municipal Party committees on the evening of the 24th, deciding to organize a ten-thousand-person inspection team throughout the province to conduct in-depth inspections of all people's communes in order to consolidate and improve them.

The conference requested that the province strengthen rural work from December this year to March next year, with the most important task being to do a good job in the people's communes. The conference believed that the overall work of the people's communes in the province was very good and that some experience had been gained. However, the people's communes were only recently established, and some problems still exist in the work, which must be solved through in-depth inspections. Based on the situation of the people's communes in various regions, the conference determined that the following aspects should be mainly inspected: this year's production situation and next year's production plans; distribution situation; work of public canteens; arrangement of work and rest schedules; welfare undertakings; militarization of organization, combatization of action, collectivization of life, and democratization of management; arrangement of labor force; water conservancy construction; field management of wheat; afforestation and unified purchase of grain, etc. The conference decided that the inspection team would be composed of one thousand people drawn from provincial-level departments, one thousand people drawn from local municipal Party committees, and eight thousand people drawn from various counties. Members of the inspection team will depart from various locations within days.

The conference requested that the inspection team use the method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle to do a good job in inspection, that is, both advanced places and backward places should be inspected, and problems should be discovered and solved simultaneously. Each inspection group should go deep into the communes, teams, fields, canteens, and homes for the elderly for inspection. During the inspection, personnel from the people's communes can be absorbed into the inspection group to conduct mutual inspections.

(People's Daily) Zhengzhou - In order to further improve the collective living and welfare undertakings, promptly summarize and promote advanced experiences, discover problems and solve problems, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently transferred 135 cadres from provincial-level departments to form a living and welfare inspection team, which was dispatched to various regions on November 16 to conduct a comprehensive inspection of living and welfare work.

The focus of this major inspection of living and welfare is: (1) To gain an in-depth understanding of the ideological trends of various people, including the views of leaders at all levels and cadres directly managing living and welfare work on living and welfare work, as well as the public opinion and reflections of all strata on the collectivization of life; (2) To understand the quantity and quality of the management personnel of living and welfare undertakings such as cooks, childcare workers, and accountants, and the experience of how to train and improve these people; (3) To understand whether the mass line has been implemented in the large-scale development of living and welfare undertakings, whether democratic management has been implemented in the canteen work, whether the Party committees at all levels regularly discuss this work, and whether there are sound specialized institutions for specialized management; (4) To understand the situation of public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and the clothing and rest of commune members.

Before the inspection team set off, the person in charge of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out to the comrades of the inspection team: When conducting a major inspection of living and welfare, it is necessary to combine it with production inspection. It is necessary to first grasp achievements and grasp experience, discover advanced experience, and promptly summarize and promote it, and at the same time, pay attention to discovering and helping to solve various specific problems in the large-scale development of living and welfare work. During the inspection, it is necessary to eat, live, and labor with the masses, pay attention to following the mass line, and achieve "one person serving as four staff members," that is, both a propagandist for collective living and welfare undertakings, and an inspector, evaluator, and ordinary worker.

    组织力量　深入检查　总结经验　解决问题
    努力巩固和提高人民公社
    安徽组织万人检查团，河南检查生活福利工作
    本报合肥27日电　中共安徽省委在24日晚召开地、市委书记电话会议，决定在全省组织万人检查团，深入各个人民公社检查工作，以巩固和提高人民公社。
    会议要求全省在今年12月到明年3月要加强农村工作，其中最主要的是要做好人民公社工作。会议认为全省人民公社工作总的讲来很好，并且取得了一些经验。但是，人民公社刚办不久，工作中还存在一些问题，这些问题必须通过深入检查来解决。会议根据各地人民公社的情况，确定主要检查下列各方面的问题：今年的生产情况与明年的生产打算；分配情况；公共食堂工作；作息时间的安排；福利事业；组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化和管理民主化的情况；劳动力的安排；兴修水利；小麦田间管理；绿化和粮食统购等问题。会议决定检查团由省直属机关抽一千人，各地市委抽一千人，各县抽八千人组成。检查团的成员日内即可分别从各地出发。
    会议要求检查团采用抓两头带中间的办法做好检查工作，即既要检查先进的地方，也要检查落后的地方，并要一边发现问题，一边解决问题。各检查组要深入到社、到队、到田间、到食堂和到敬老院等地方检查。检查时，可吸收人民公社的人员参加检查组进行互相检查。
    本报讯　为进一步搞好集体生活福利事业，及时总结推广先进经验，发现问题和解决问题，中共河南省委最近从省直机关抽调一百三十五名干部，组成生活福利检查团，在11月16日分赴各地进行生活福利工作全面大检查。
    这次生活福利大检查的重点是：（1）深入了解各种人的思想动态，包括各级领导和直接管理生活福利工作的干部对生活福利工作的看法，各阶层对生活集体化的舆论和反映等；（2）了解炊事员、保教员、会计等生活福利事业管理人员的数量和质量情况，对这些人怎样培养与提高的经验；（3）了解在大办生活福利事业中是否贯彻了群众路线，在食堂工作中是否贯彻了民主管理，各级党委是否经常讨论这项工作，有无健全的专门机构进行专门管理；（4）了解公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、幸福院和社员的穿衣、休息等情况。
    检查团出发前，中共河南省委负责人向检查团的同志指出：在进行生活福利大检查时，一定要和生产检查结合起来。要首先抓成绩、抓经验，发现先进经验，就及时总结推广，同时注意发现和帮助解决在大办生活福利工作中的各项具体问题。在检查中，要与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，注意走群众路线，达到“一身兼四员”，即：既是集体生活福利事业的宣传员，又是检查员、评比员，也是普通的工作员。
