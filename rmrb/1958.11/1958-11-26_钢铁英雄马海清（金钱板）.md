    Steel Hero Ma Haiqing
    (Clapper Talk)
    Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Xiaowu
    Steel hero Ma Haiqing,
    Soaring spirit, drive to the sky,
    Every ounce, every second he vies,
    Daring to defy fierce flames and high temperatures.
    Four short lines introduce my tale,
    Now let’s begin the main narrative.
    This happened in September,
    On the twenty-ninth, the night was deep,
    The open-hearth furnace bell rang loud and tight,
    In an instant, red light illuminated half the sky,
    From the tapping spout, steel flowers splashed, molten steel surged,
    The teeming ladle gleamed golden, emitting sparks,
    One furnace held a hundred and forty tons of steel,
    Workers beamed with joy in their hearts.
    Suddenly, a problem arose at the waist door,
    Only to see a stream of steel flowing from the waist door.
    At this moment, the entire furnace of molten steel hadn't drained,
    From the tapping spout, a golden dragon was rushing forth,
    Within the furnace, eighty tons of molten steel remained,
    Failure to rescue would mean a significant loss.
    Failure to rescue would turn the steel into scrap,
    Failure to rescue could cause accidents and burns.
    The workers gritted their teeth and stamped their feet,
    Each one anxious as fire, sweat dripping.
    Just as the situation reached a critical juncture,
    A figure suddenly emerged from the crowd,
    只见他红色脸膛汗珠滚，
    Eyes bright, slender build, and young in age.
    If you ask this person's name and surname,
    He is the Communist Party member Ma Haiqing.
    He immediately grabbed a steel bar and made a decision,
    In a flash, he darted to the waist door,
    Inserting the steel bar into the opening, he pressed hard,
    Allowing the steel to flow smoothly without leakage.
    At this time, the steel stream continued to spray outwards,
    The tapping port radiated scorching heat, unbearable to stand.
    Ma Haiqing persevered in the battle, never slacking,
    Head held high, chest out, resisting the high temperature.
    Instantly, his breathing became rapid and labored,
    Sweat poured down his forehead like rain.
    The steel stream cascaded fiercely, with intense light,
    In an instant, golden steel flowers splashed all over his body.
    The steel flowers burned his chest and ignited his collar,
    His protective clothing emitted wisps of blue smoke.
    At this moment, the Party Branch Secretary rushed forward:
    "Let me do it, let me replace you, Ma Haiqing!"
    Ma Haiqing quickly replied: "It's alright,
    This furnace of steel was painstakingly refined,
    Rescuing the steel, what's a thousand degrees of heat?
    With me here, every ounce of steel must be saved."
    With both feet firmly planted on the steel bar, teeth clenched tight,
    Rescuing the steel relying solely on a sincere heart.
    If it's true gold, why fear the raging fire?
    If it's a hero, we'll see how he advances and retreats!
    The more he pressed on the steel bar, the stronger he felt,
    Like a Mount Tai standing firm at the waist door.
    Steadfast in the sea of fire,
    Like a supporting pillar beside the furnace,
    He persisted until the last drop of steel flowed out,
    Only then did Ma Haiqing breathe a sigh of relief.
    At this moment, he finally felt very tired,
    His hands and feet ached, his skin burned, and his head was dizzy.
    The workers rushed forward to comfort him,
    "Old Ma, rest well and recuperate,
    Tonight you rescued eighty tons of steel,
    Creating a miracle, fighting for steel, and earning merit!"
    Ma Haiqing cracked a smile and spoke:
    "Increasing steel production is a major task,
    With steel, national construction is guaranteed,
    It is for the early realization of socialism..."
    Having finished singing this tale of rescuing steel,
    I hope everyone will learn from the hero Ma Haiqing!

    钢铁英雄马海清
    （金钱板）
    重庆钢铁公司　晓午
    钢铁英雄马海清，
    干劲冲天志凌云，
    斤两不放争分秒，
    敢欺烈火斗高温。
    四句短诗把话引，
    下面就来唱正文。
    事在今年九月份，
    二十九日夜已深，
    大平炉钟声当当敲得紧，
    一刹时红光照亮半天云，
    出钢槽钢花飞溅钢水涌，
    盛钢桶金光闪闪冒火星，
    一炉钢重有一百四十吨，
    工人们眉飞色舞喜在心。
    忽然间腰门眼子出毛病，
    只见得一股钢流出腰门。
    这时候全炉钢水未流尽，
    出钢槽金色火龙正奔腾，
    炉膛内还有钢水八十吨，
    不抢救这个损失就不轻。
    不抢救钢水就要成废品，
    不抢救还会出事烫伤人。
    工人们咬紧牙关脚直顿，
    一个个心急如火汗淋淋。
    正当这千钧一发情况紧，
    人群中忽然闪出一个人，
    只见他红色脸膛汗珠滚，
    眼睛亮身材瘦长年纪轻。
    若要问此人他的名和姓，
    他就是共产党员马海清。
    他马上手拿钢钎作决定，
    转瞬间一个箭步到腰门，
    把钢钎插进眼子忙顶紧，
    让钢水不跑不漏畅通行。
    这时候钢流继续往外喷，
    出钢口千度高温烤坏人。
    马海清坚持战斗不松劲，
    昂着头挺起胸膛挡高温。
    一刹时呼吸急促喘气紧，
    头额上汗珠滚滚像雨淋。
    只见那钢流倾泻火光猛，
    一刹时金色钢花溅满身。
    只见那钢花烧胸燃衣领，
    劳保服青烟四起雾腾腾。
    这时候总支书记冲上阵：
    “让我来，我来换你，马海清”！
    马海清连忙回答：“不要紧，
    一炉钢千辛万苦才炼成，
    抢救钢千度高温算个甚，
    有我在一两钢水也要争。”
    两只脚踩住钢钎牙咬紧，
    抢救钢全凭赤诚一颗心。
    是真金岂怕什么火力猛？
    是英雄就看进退怎样行！
    踩钢钎越踩越强越有劲，
    像一座泰山屹立在腰门。
    火海中坚如盘石身安稳，
    就像是炉旁擎天柱一根，
    坚持到最后一滴钢流尽，
    马海清松一口气才放心。
    这时候他才感到累得很，
    手脚酸皮肤烤痛头发昏。
    工人们齐涌上前来慰问，
    “老马，好好休息养精神，
    你今晚抢救钢水八十吨，
    创奇迹为钢而战立功勋”！
    马海清裂开笑嘴把话论：
    “增产钢这是一件大事情，
    有了钢建设国家有保证，
    为的是社会主义早建成……”
    唱完这抢救钢水书一本，
    望大家学习英雄马海清！
