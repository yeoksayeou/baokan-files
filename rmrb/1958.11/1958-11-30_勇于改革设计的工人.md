Daring to Reform Designs

First Automobile Factory Apprentice Chen Zilin

	Workers engage in design,
	Shift output two hundred fifty,
	One factory becomes five factories,
	Annual output fifteen thousand.

This is the battle slogan of the worker masses at the First Automobile Works in Changchun during the movement to involve workers in design and leap forward to a shift output of 250 vehicles. According to the original design, the First Automobile Works in Changchun was only supposed to produce 30,000 vehicles annually, with a shift output of 50 vehicles. However, after a vigorous mass movement was launched throughout the factory, the superstitions that "advanced quotas cannot be broken" and "advanced designs cannot be changed" were shattered one after another. The design of this advanced factory was bravely broken by workers, who were traditionally considered unqualified to participate in various factory designs. The red flag was first planted in the steering gear group of the chassis workshop's steering mechanism section.

…In late June, factory director Rao Bin reported the factory's long-term plan at the factory's employee representative assembly, announcing that the factory would reach an annual output of 150,000 vehicles in 1962. Zhu Wuxi, the leader of the steering gear housing group, was very excited. On his way back to the workshop, he walked and thought expansively: "If we are to produce 150,000 vehicles annually, our chassis workshop will have to grow several times its current size. The factory walls will have to be torn down, and the employees' dormitories will have to be moved further away. The trolleybuses will be insufficient for workers to commute to work; they will all have to take trains!..." However, he also felt that this way of thinking was not in line with the spirit of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

	Refuting the "Reaching-Out Hand" Faction

A few days later, following the instructions of the municipal party committee, the factory issued a battle mobilization to advance towards 400,000 big-character posters, focusing on investigating production (production management, product design, equipment potential, rules and regulations). The movement quickly unfolded in the steering gear housing group. In just three days, eighteen workers posted 290 big-character posters. Qin Fengzhang, the party group leader, and Zhu Wuxi, the administrative group leader, were very excited when they saw that the workers had put forward many suggestions for improving equipment, improving processes, and increasing production efficiency, believing that the masses' opinions indeed contained valuable ideas. However, after three days, the number of big-character posters suddenly decreased, and the masses did not know where else to direct their efforts, and rationalization proposals entered a low ebb. At this time, Qin Fengzhang, the party group leader, proposed at the joint meeting of party, government, and trade union group leaders that the current movement should be considered in conjunction with the factory's long-term plan. Thus, the mass rationalization proposal movement was pushed to a new climax. At this time, Li Xilin, the trade union group leader, said: "I think we should reverse the process and exchange the machine tool processing for the steering gear housing and the steering gear side cover, put the large parts on large machine tools, and put the small parts on small machine tools. One shift can produce 250 sets of parts." Many people agreed with this opinion. Qin Fengzhang seized on this trend and more clearly proposed:

"Let's make a shift output of 250 vehicles our group's goal. What do you think?" He also reported this bold idea to the party branch. The party branch secretary instructed him: "This is very good, but we must unify our thinking and lead everyone to conduct a thorough and meticulous investigation around this goal..."

After that, a fierce debate against the "reaching-out hand" faction unfolded violently. Tian Ruikang, the deputy administrative group leader, said: "Of the eighteen machine tools in the group, fifteen can barely reach a shift output of 100. Without adding equipment or personnel, I don't think we have the confidence to achieve a shift output of 250!" Some people also said: "When the shift output was 100, the output was already doubled. Without adding equipment to achieve 250, there is no such easy thing!" Ge Shuqi, the youth league group leader, remained silent and did not express an attitude. Zhu Wuxi, the administrative group leader, also wavered. Qin Fengzhang refuted these erroneous views with convincing facts. He said: "Our original design was for a shift output of 50, with this many people. The shift output of 100 is also with this many people. Can't we produce more with these same machines and these same people? Besides, the production capacity of the existing machines is already close to 250. As long as we mobilize the masses to overcome the key problems, the production capacity of other machines can also be increased. Machines are dead, but people are alive!" Zhu Wuxi felt that what he said was correct when he heard these words and felt that he should not waver. After the meeting, Qin Fengzhang also said to Tian Ruikang and Ge Shuqi: "Everyone has already put forward so many good ideas. We haven't even tried them yet, how can we say it won't work!" In this way, the confidence of several group leaders was increased.

	Eliminating Feelings of Inferiority

After this fierce debate, the enthusiasm of all the workers in the group to improve to a shift output of 250 was boosted. They moved from improving equipment and improving processes to changing the product structure. They observed several different types of automobiles and found that the connecting pipes of the steering gear housings of various automobiles were of different lengths. If they could be shortened by 50 millimeters, this process could save 45 tons of steel and reduce one-third of the processing time each year. But the problem became big when they mentioned modifying the product design! Changing the product design has always been the business of designers and engineers, and it must be approved by the chief engineer or the State Automotive Bureau. Workers have no right to ask about it. Later, Qin Fengzhang reported this situation to the department. The department director also felt that modifying the product was related to the change of the entire automobile structure and was somewhat hesitant. This department was factory director Rao Bin's "experimental field." When the factory director participated in the "experimental field" meeting, he asked Rao Bin: "The workers suggest modifying the product design, can this work?" The factory director told him very positively: "Modifying the product design is a good thing! We can't just let the workers manage gloves, emulsions, and cutting oil; we should let them participate in technical leadership and factory design!" The department director felt relieved. He went back and instructed the steering gear housing group: "We must be clear about the key points, the measures must be specific, and we must find out what key problems remain to be solved to achieve a shift output of 250, and how to overcome them?" The party organization and administrative leaders of the entire factory also mobilized design and process technicians to go deep into the field and discuss with the workers.

At this time, the workers became bolder and more enthusiastic. Some workers said: "We haven't been able to let go these past two years, but this time? We can solve the problem!" They debated during the day and drew and designed at night. Several group leaders moved to the workshop, eating and sleeping there. They spent the whole day holding parts and product drawings, checking and recording each part, each process, and each machine tool, and studying and debating them one by one. Finally, they formulated a plan for a shift output of 250 vehicles with three no additions (no additional equipment, no additional personnel, no additional operating area) and three turnovers (three machine tools, three workers, and 50 square meters of operating area).

	The Engineer Admits Defeat

However, to implement this plan, six barriers still needed to be broken. What should they do? Engineer Ren Quan advocated removing two low-efficiency machine tools and adding two high-efficiency machine tools. He believed that this was still worthwhile because increasing production efficiency fourfold by only replacing two machine tools did not increase the amount of equipment. But Qin Fengzhang and Zhu Wuxi calculated that this would require the state to invest 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and ordering from other factories would take a year before it could be put into production, so they firmly opposed this opinion. They advocated breaking through the six barriers by improving existing equipment, merging processes, increasing the feed rate, and increasing the vehicle speed. The engineer believed that this would violate the process requirements and could not agree under any circumstances. But the workers insisted on experimenting. Later, the two sides argued fiercely. The engineer said: "Everything you propose is okay, but what I propose isn't!" and left.

Soon after, the workshop director and the party branch secretary both asked Qin Fengzhang with concern: "Can you handle these six barriers yourselves?" He replied very firmly: "We will definitely handle them and guarantee that we will work hard for seven days and seven nights to pass the six barriers!" So they did what they said and boldly began experimenting. One of the six key points was processing the steering gear housing with a hexagonal lathe. This machine tool originally took 20 minutes to process one part. After the workers improved it when the shift output was 100, it took five minutes. Therefore, some workers believed that the efficiency of this machine tool had reached its limit. Lao Qin believed that this was the first barrier, and as long as they broke through the first barrier, the other five barriers would be easy to break through. At first, he increased the vehicle speed from 233 revolutions per minute to 322 revolutions per minute, which increased production efficiency somewhat, but it still did not reach the shift output of 250. Lao Qin was not discouraged and stared at the cutting tool for several hours, but there was still no improvement. Lao Qin was immersed in deep thought. At this time, he remembered the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory merging processes to process the oil pump, and he had an epiphany. He merged the four stations into two stations and used combined cutting tools to process the part. As a result, it took one minute and forty seconds to process a steering gear housing, and the shift output of parts increased from 120 sets to 260 sets, and the product quality was also improved. Lao Qin broke through the first barrier and, without even taking a break, went with Zhu Wuxi to test another multi-tool semi-automatic lathe. Unexpectedly, this was an even more difficult barrier. Fang Chusheng, the young worker operating this machine tool, prepared the experimental cutting tools and tools early on Sunday morning. Under the attention of all the workers in the group, Lao Qin started the machine tool at a high speed of 600 revolutions per minute. Purple-blue iron filings, carrying white smoke, flew out continuously. However, Qin Fengzhang's use of high-speed cutting only reduced the processing time for each set of steering arm axles by five seconds, which did not meet the requirements for a shift output of 250. At this time, Xiao Fang was so anxious that he was about to cry. Seeing that Xiao Fang was very depressed, Lao Qin proposed to use heavy cutting to increase the feed rate from 0.23 to 0.71. As a result of the experiment, the production efficiency was doubled compared to the original, and the shift output exceeded 250 sets. At this time, Xiao Fang, who had been in a depressed mood, jumped up with joy, and everyone's face showed the joy of victory. Finally, the golden steel boring machine tested by Tian Ruikang had not reached 250 after several days and nights of hard work. This machine tool was very precise. Because the processed parts were long, the boring bar vibrated, and the quantity and quality of the products always could not be improved. After more than 20 experiments, all failed. Qin Fengzhang said: "Even if the experiment fails a thousand times, don't be discouraged!" Everyone was encouraged by Lao Qin's overcoming one barrier after another and concentrated their efforts on this machine tool. As a result, Tian Ruikang, based on the suggestion of the designer in the design office, tried using cemented carbide instead of lead as a shock absorber and overcame the problem of boring bar vibration. The boring efficiency also jumped from 130 to 280. The six major key points were broken, and the production capacity of all 18 machine tools reached and exceeded the requirements for a shift output of 250 vehicles. At this time, engineer Ren Quan was also on the scene. He saw this result with his own eyes and couldn't help but say to Qin Fengzhang: "You guys are really good!"

The actions of the steering gear housing group set up a red flag throughout the factory. It pushed the large-scale mass movement that had already been launched in the factory to a higher level. Now, the technical revolution movement of the First Automobile Works of "workers engaging in design, a shift output of 250, and one factory becoming five factories" is magnificent and full of momentum. A new type of socialist enterprise is about to take shape; a more advanced automobile factory with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is about to appear.

    勇于改革设计的工人
    第一汽车制造厂徒工　陈子林
    工人搞设计，
    班产二百五，
    一厂变五厂，
    年产十五万。
    这是长春第一汽车厂在开展工人参加设计、向班产汽车二百五十辆跃进运动中工人群众的战斗口号。按照设计，长春第一汽车厂，原只年产三万辆汽车，班产五十辆汽车，可是在全厂开展了蓬勃的群众运动后，“先进定额不敢突破”，“先进的设计不能变动”的迷信，一个接着一个都被打破了。这个先进工厂的设计竟被一向认为不能参加工厂各种设计的工人们勇敢地打破了。红旗首先插在这个工厂的底盘车间转向工部转向器壳小组里。
    ……6月下旬，厂长饶斌在全厂职工代表大会上报告了工厂的远景规划，宣布工厂在1962年要达到年产十五万辆汽车时，转向器壳小组长朱武喜，十分振奋。他在回车间的路上，一面走，一面海阔天空地想：“如果要年产十五万辆，我们底盘车间也要发展到有现在的几倍大。这样厂区围墙拆除，职工宿舍迁到更远的地方，工人上下班电车不顶事了，都得乘火车啦！……”可是，他又觉得这样想，不符合多快好省的精神。
      驳倒“伸手派”
    不几天，厂部根据市委的指示，围绕着查生产（查生产管理、产品设计、设备潜力、规章制度）发出向四十万张大字报进军的战斗动员。运动很快在转向器壳小组展开了。短短的三天里，十八个工人，就贴出了二百九十张大字报。党小组长秦凤章和行政组长朱武喜，看到工人提出了很多改进设备、改进工艺、提高生产效率的建议，都很兴奋，认为群众的意见中确实有宝贝。但是，三天后，大字报突然减少了，群众不知再往那儿使劲想主意，合理化建议转入低潮。这时，党小组长秦凤章，在党政工团小组长碰头会上，提出当前运动与工厂远景规划，结合起来考虑。于是把群众合理化建议运动，又推向高潮。就在这时，工会小组长李喜林说：“我看颠倒一下工序，把转向器壳和转向器侧盖，换一换机床加工，大零件放到大机床加工，小零件放到小机床加工，一班就能生产二百五十辆份。”很多人都同意这个意见。秦凤章抓住这个苗头，更明确地提出：
  “把班产二百五十辆，作为我们全组的奋斗方向，大家看行不行？”并把这个大胆的想法，汇报到党支部。支部书记指示他说：“这样做很好，但要统一思想，要围绕这个方向，领导大家深入细致的查……”
    之后，一场反对“伸手派”的大辩论，就猛烈地展开了。行政副组长田瑞康说：“全组十八台机床中，有十五台勉强可以达到班产一百辆，要不增添设备，不给人，实现班产二百五十，我看没有把握！”还有的人说：“班产百辆时，产量已加一番，不添设备实现二百五十，那有这么便宜的事！”团小组长葛淑琦，闷声不响，不表示态度。行政组长朱武喜也摇摆不定。秦凤章用令人信服的事实，反驳了这些错误的看法。他说：“我们原来设计班产五十辆，是这么多人，班产一百辆，也是这么多人，难道用这些设备，这些人，就不能生产得更多吗？何况现有几台设备，已接近二百五十，别的设备，只要发动群众攻破关键，生产能力也可以提高上去。机器是死的，人可是活的！”朱武喜一听这些话说得很对，觉得自己不该动摇。会后，秦凤章又对田瑞康和葛淑琦说：“大家已经提出了这么多好办法，还没有试验，我们怎能说不行呢！”这样，几个小组长的信心都提高了。
        打掉自卑感
    经过这场激烈的争论，全组工人向班产二百五十改进的劲头鼓起来了。他们从改进设备，改进工艺，发展到改变产品结构。他们观察了数种不同类型的汽车，发现各种汽车转向器壳的连接管，长短不同，只要把它缩短五十公厘，一年就可以使这个工序节省四十五吨钢材，减少三分之一的加工时间。可是一提修改产品设计，问题就大啦！更改产品设计，向来都是设计师和工程师的事，而且要经过总工程师或国家汽车局的批准。工人是无权过问的。后来秦凤章又把这个情况，汇报到工部，工部主任也觉得修改产品，关系到整个汽车结构的改变，有些犹豫。这个工部是厂长饶斌的“试验田”。在厂长参加“试验田”会议的时候，他问饶斌：“工人建议修改产品设计，这能行吗？”厂长非常肯定地告诉他说：“改产品设计是好事！不能只让工人去管理手套、乳化液、切削油之类，应该让他们参加技术领导和工厂设计呀！”工部主任心里一块石头落了地。他回去就指示转向器壳小组：要关键明确，措施具体，弄清实现班产二百五十，还有哪些关键，要怎样攻破？全厂党组织和行政领导，也发动设计、工艺技术人员，深入现场和工人一起讨论。
    这时，工人们胆量更大，劲头更足了。有的工人说：“这两年放不开劲，这回吗？可解决问题啦！”他们白天辩论，晚间画图、设计。几个小组长都搬到车间来，吃在车间，睡在车间。他们整天拿着零件和产品图纸，按每个零件，每道工序，每台机床，逐项检查记录，一个个地研究、争论。最后，制订出一个三不加（不加设备，不加人，不加作业面积）和三上缴（三台机床，三个工人，五十平方公尺作业面积）班产二百五十辆的方案。
        工程师服输了
    但是，要实现这个方案，还需要突破六关。怎么办呢？工程师任权主张去掉两台低效率机床，增加两台高效率的机床。他认为这样还是合算的。因为把生产效率提高四倍只调换两台机床，并没有增加设备。但秦凤章和朱武喜一计算：这样设备数量虽然没有增加，却需要国家投资两三万元，而且去外厂订货，要一年以后才能投入生产，便坚决反对这种意见。他们主张从改进现有设备，合并工序，增大走刀量，提高车速等方面去闯过六关。工程师认为这样会违犯工艺要求，无论如何不能同意。但工人一定要试验一下。后来，两方争论得面红耳赤。工程师说一句：“你们提的都行，我提的不行！”就离开了。
    不久，车间主任和党总支书记，都很关切地问秦凤章：“这六关你们自己能包下来吗？”他很坚定地回答：“我们一定包下来，保证苦战七天七夜过六关！”于是他们说干就干，大胆地试验起来。六个关键中有一关，是加工转向器壳的六角车床。这台机床原来要二十分钟加工一个零件，在班产百辆时，经过工人改进，达到五分钟一个，因此有的工人认为这台机床的效率到顶了。老秦认为这是第一关，只要打破头关，其他五关就容易闯过。开始，他把车速由每分钟二百三十三转提高到三百二十二转，生产效率提高一些，还达不到班产二百五十。老秦没有灰心，一连几个小时眼巴巴地盯住车刀，还是没有提高。老秦沉浸在苦思苦想中。这时，他想起上海柴油机厂加工机油泵合并工序，心里开了窍，把四个工位并成两个工位，采用组合刀具加工，结果用一分四十秒加工出一个转向器壳，班产零件由一百二十辆份增到二百六十辆份，产品质量也提高了。老秦冲破了第一关，连休息也没有休息，又和朱武喜去试验另一台多刀半自动车床。没有想到这是更为困难的一关。操作这台机床的青工方初生，星期天一清早，就把试验用的刀具、工具准备妥当。老秦在全组工人的注视下，以每分钟六百转的高速，开动了机床，紫蓝色的铁屑，带着白烟，接连不断地向外飞卷。但是秦凤章采用高速切削，每组转向臂轴加工时间，只比原来少五秒钟，达不到班产二百五十的要求。这时，小方急得像要哭似的。老秦看到小方的心情很沉重，又提出改用强力切削，把走刀量由零点二三加大到零点七一，试验的结果，生产效率比原来提高一倍，班产量超过了二百五十辆份。这时，心情沉重的小方，高兴得跳起来，每个人脸上，都露出了胜利的喜悦。最后，田瑞康试验的金钢镗床，经过几昼夜的苦战，还没有达到二百五十。这台机床精度很高。由于加工零件长，镗杆产生震荡，产品的数量和质量总是跃不上去，前后试验了二十多次，都失败了。秦凤章说：“试验一千次不成功，也不灰心！”大家从老秦闯过一关又一关的事实中，得到了鼓舞，把火力都集中到这台机床上，结果田瑞康根据设计处设计师的建议试用硬质合金代替铅做减震器，克服了镗杆震动的毛病。镗孔效率，也由一百三十个跳到二百八十个。六大关键被攻破了，十八台机床的生产能力，全部达到和超过了班产二百五十辆份汽车的要求。这时工程师任权也在现场，他亲眼看到这个结果，不禁对秦凤章说：“你们就是行啊！”
    转向器壳小组的行动，在全厂树起一面红旗。它把全厂已经开展的大规模的群众运动推向更高的水平。现在，第一汽车制造厂“工人搞设计，班产二百五，一厂变五厂”的技术革命运动，气势雄伟、波澜壮阔。一个新型的社会主义企业即将形成；一个多、快、好、省的更先进的汽车工厂即将出现。（附图片）
