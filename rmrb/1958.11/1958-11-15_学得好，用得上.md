Learn Well, Apply Well
    Ai Bei

    In the process of combining education and productive labor, we have seen that the aircraft made by students of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics have taken to the skies, the first AC computing machine made by students of Tsinghua University has begun to operate formally, and students of Taiyuan Water Conservancy School have formulated a basin management plan for thirty-six river systems. These moving achievements are all triumphs of combining education and productive labor!

    Amidst the songs of triumph, we also see those who separate education from productive labor being defeated one by one. Teachers from the Department of Aquaculture at Shandong University went to sea to fish and compete with fishermen, but the fishermen caught hundreds or thousands of pounds in one net, while they only caught one fish. Teachers from the Metal Cutting Teaching and Research Group at Xi'an Jiaotong University went to factories to cut parts for textile machines, but were defeated by students participating in productive labor by a score of one to two hundred. Such small "comedies" have been staged in almost every school.

    However, we must still congratulate these people, because they have already made a "first attempt" and started to practice, "defeat is honorable." Through practice, they will accept the lessons, recognize the significance of combining education with productive labor, and follow this path. In this way, they will surely reap abundant fruits and sing songs of triumph.

    Combining education and productive labor, combining theory with the practice of socialist construction, should be the only correct method of learning and the only correct method of cognition. Students must learn knowledge, and they can only learn it in the most basic practical activity—productive activity. Dialectical materialism puts practice in the first place, believing that people's understanding cannot be separated from practice at all, and opposes all erroneous theories that deny the importance of practice and separate understanding from practice. "How can you get cubs without entering the tiger's den?" Ban Chao's words have both practical and cognitive significance.

    Education divorced from productive labor, theory divorced from practice, is a wrong method of learning and cognition. No wonder people who study water conservancy divorced from reality do not know whether the reservoir is square or round; people who study biology mistake taro leaves for lotus leaves. Such intellectuals divorced from reality are indeed too ignorant!

    Our country is carrying out a great socialist construction, and the socialist economic foundation is becoming more and more solid. The socialist economic foundation requires its superstructure—school education—to adapt to it quickly and serve it, which requires the combination of education and productive labor, and requires students to become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. The socialist economic foundation will not require the establishment of a bourgeois educational superstructure that serves the capitalist economic foundation and cultivates bourgeois intellectuals who ride on the heads of the working people. The old superstructure must be torn down, and the new superstructure must be established. Isn't this extremely obvious? Therefore, any objections and clamors against the combination of education and productive labor will be overwhelmed by the strongest voice of the laborers. The combination of education and productive labor meets the requirements of the socialist economic foundation. It is becoming increasingly consolidated and is increasingly playing its role in the socialist economic foundation.

    The songs of triumph of the combination of education and productive labor are spreading everywhere, and this is just the overture! Let us hold high the red flag of combining education and productive labor, learn in the correct way, so that the people of the whole country can learn well and apply well, so that socialist productivity can be further developed, and the socialist economy can be more prosperous.

    学得好，用得上

    在教育和生产劳动结合的过程中，我们看到，北京航空学院学生自制的飞机上了天，清华大学学生自制的我国第一台交流计算台开始正式运行，太原水利学校学生制定了三十六条河系的流域治理规划。这些动人的成就，都是教育和生产劳动结合的凯歌！
    凯歌声中，我们又看到那些把教育脱离生产劳动的人们一个个打了败仗。山东大学水产系教师下海捕鱼，同渔民较量一下，结果渔民一网千百斤，而他们一网只打了一条鱼。西安交通大学金切教研组教师，下厂切削纺织机上的零件，结果以一比二百败给参加生产劳动的学生。这样小小的“喜剧”，差不多在每个学校里都曾演出过。
    可是，我们毕竟还要向这些人们祝贺，因为他们已经“破题儿第一遭”，开始了实践，“虽败犹荣”。经过实践，他们将接受教训，认识到教育结合生产劳动的意义，遵循这条道路走去。这样，他们一定会获得累累硕果，高唱凯歌。
    教育和生产劳动结合，理论同社会主义建设的实践结合，应当是唯一的正确的学习方法，也是唯一的正确的认识方法。学生要学知识，也只有在最基本的实践活动——生产活动中才能学到。辩证唯物论的认识论把实践提到第一的地位，认为人们的认识一点也不能离开实践，反对一切否认实践重要性、使认识离开实践的错误理论。“不入虎穴、焉得虎子？”班超的这句话，就具有实践的和认识的意义。
    教育脱离生产劳动，理论脱离实践，是错误的学习方法和认识方法。怪不得脱离实际的学水利的人，不知道水库是方的圆的；学生物的人，把芋叶当作荷叶了。这种脱离实际的知识分子确实是太无知了！
    我国正在进行伟大的社会主义建设，社会主义的经济基础已经越打越稳固。社会主义经济基础要求它的上层建筑——学校教育能迅速地适应它，并且为它服务，这就要求教育和生产劳动相结合，要求学生成为有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者。社会主义经济基础不会要求树立为资本主义经济基础服务的资产阶级教育的上层建筑，培养骑在劳动人民头上的资产阶级知识分子。旧的上层建筑必须拆倒，新的上层建筑必须树立。这不是极其明显的事吗？所以，任何人对于教育和生产劳动结合的非难和叫嚣，都会被劳动者的最强音所压倒。教育和生产劳动结合，是适应社会主义经济基础的要求的。它正在越来越巩固并日益发挥它对社会主义经济基础的作用。
    教育和生产劳动结合的凯歌到处传，这不过刚刚是序曲罢了！让我们高举教育和生产劳动相结合的红旗，以正确的方法来进行学习，使全国人民都能学得好，用得上，使社会主义的生产力得到更大的发展，社会主义的经济更为繁荣。
