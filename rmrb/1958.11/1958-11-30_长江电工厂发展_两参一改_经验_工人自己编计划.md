    Yangtze Electric Factory Develops "Two Participations, One Reform" Experience
    Workers Draft Their Own Plans

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to Chongqing Daily, the Yangtze Electric Factory, in promoting the experience of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," mobilized the masses of workers to draft their own plans and devolved the technical management powers of approving rationalization proposals, formulating process regulations, and inspecting product quality to the groups. This further stimulated the workers' sense of responsibility and production enthusiasm and creativity, promoting a greater leap forward in production.

    Since the factory started doing this in August, its benefits have been demonstrated in all aspects. In the past, plans were mainly drawn up by planning personnel based on measured quotas and the original production level, without taking into account the potential of the workers, and there was a serious idea of passive balance. Moreover, the equipment and labor required to implement the plan were also rigidly stipulated, and the production groups had no right to make flexible adjustments. Now, it is completely different with the masses of workers drafting their own plans. First of all, they fully tap the potential of equipment and labor, and then balance according to the advanced level to determine their own planning targets, which are drafted quickly and are more advanced. In the past, the second workshop relied on technical personnel to compile monthly plans, which generally took six or seven days. Now, the workers themselves only need two hours to compile a plan. In the third quarter of this year, if the plan was compiled according to the measured quota level, the workshop would need to add more than one hundred workers to complete the task. The plan compiled by the workers themselves did not add a single worker, but the task was still excellently completed due to the promotion of the multi-machine tool management and other experiences.

    This also promotes the combination of leaders, workers, and engineering and technical personnel. In the process of formulating and implementing the plan, the workers consciously improve the management of the group and improve equipment and process regulations, and the solution of these problems is inseparable from the support and assistance of leaders and engineering and technical personnel. Liu Yulin, an old worker in the Second Workshop, improved the chip removal process of a certain product from manual operation to machine production. Because of his low level of education, he could not design drawings, so he asked an engineer to design them. The engineer looked through books for half a month and said that he could not find the information and it was difficult to do. The old worker told the branch secretary of the workshop about this. With the support and encouragement of the branch secretary, he drew a sketch himself, and then asked the engineer to help calculate the machine transmission and structural proportions. Finally, he created an automatic chip removal machine, which increased production efficiency by more than ten times compared to manual operation.

    Doing so is also more conducive to workers making great strides in the technical revolution. For example, in October, the task of the tool workshop was very heavy, four times more than in September. The groups vigorously carried out technical innovations, put forward many rationalization proposals, and at the same time, the groups designed, drew, and found materials by themselves. More than 10,000 innovation projects were realized throughout the month, and the task was successfully completed. In October, the workers in the Third Workshop improved equipment and process rules, so that fifteen processes were linked by machines, and seven processes were realized with one machine for multiple purposes, and production efficiency was unprecedentedly improved. From August to October, the workers in the whole factory made 125 indigenous machines themselves.

    In the past, each worker, group, and workshop was only responsible for completing the production plan of themselves and their own unit. When the plans of the various units could not be connected, they generally only reported to the leaders and asked the leaders to solve the problem. Now, the workers draft their own plans, and their consciousness and sense of responsibility for completing the plan have been greatly strengthened. They not only do everything possible to ensure the completion of their own and their own unit's plans, but also pay more attention to the completion of the factory's plan. When other units have difficulties, they take the initiative to provide support.

    The Yangtze Electric Factory adopted these measures on the basis of promoting the experience of the Qinghua Tool Factory's "two participations and one reform," with the masses of workers participating in the daily management of the production groups, cadres participating in labor, breaking down outdated rules and regulations, and streamlining institutions and reports. In the specific method of compiling plans, they adopted the method of launching mass movements. At the end of each month, the factory holds a staff meeting, where the party secretary talks about the current situation and explains the product varieties, quantities, and time requirements for production in the next month, and constantly clarifies the great significance of completing the task. Immediately afterwards, each worker draws up a personal monthly plan according to the requirements put forward by the workshop, and takes the personal plan as the starting point to summarize and compile the work plans of the group, workshop, and the entire factory, level by level, with leaders at all levels only responsible for comprehensive balance. In the process of compiling the plan, the factory also launched and organized competitions and appraisals between workers, between groups, between sections, and between workshops, setting off a mass competition upsurge of learning from each other and catching up with each other. In the specific method of mobilizing the masses of workers to participate in technical management, the main thing is to devolve powers such as approving rationalization proposals, compiling and improving process regulations, and inspecting product quality to the production groups. These powers include the cancellation of the original restriction that the group could not decide on rationalization proposals of more than 200 yuan. As long as it does not change the product performance and is conducive to production, there is no limit to the amount of money used, and the group implements it itself (if there is no confidence in the implementation of the proposal, ask the leadership for a decision). Secondly, according to production needs, the group can compile and change process regulations itself on the principle of ensuring product quality. For product quality inspection, the original system of inspection by full-time personnel for each process and type of work was abolished, and the workers themselves organized the inspection. The factory and workshop leaders only make the final appraisal of the quality of the entire finished product.

    长江电工厂发展“两参一改”经验
    工人自己编计划
    本报讯　据重庆日报报道：长江电工厂在推广两参一改三结合的经验中，发动工人群众自己编制计划，并将审批合理化建议、制订工艺规程、检验产品质量等技术管理权力下放到小组，因而更加激发了工人的责任感和生产的积极性、创造性，促进了生产的更大跃进。
    这个厂从8月份开始这样做了以后，已经在各方面显示了它的好处。以往的计划，主要是计划人员根据测定的定额和原有的生产水平编定的，没有估计到工人的潜力，存在着严重的消极平衡的思想；而且，对实现计划所需要的设备、劳动力等也规定得很死，生产小组无权进行机动调剂。现在工人群众自己编制计划，就截然不同。他们首先是充分挖掘设备和劳动力的潜力，再按先进水平平衡，确定自己的计划指标，编得又快又先进。第二车间过去依靠技术人员编月度计划，一般需要六、七天时间，现在工人自己编计划，只需要两小时就行了。今年第三季度，如果按照测定的定额水平编制计划，车间共需要增加一百多个工人才能完成任务，工人群众自己编出的计划，没有增加一个工人，但由于推广了多机床管理等经验，仍出色地完成了任务。
    这样做，也促进了领导、工人和工程技术人员的结合。工人们在编制和实现计划过程中，自觉地改进小组的管理工作和改进设备、工艺规程，而这些问题的解决，又与领导和工程技术人员的支持、协助分不开的。二车间老工人刘玉琳改进一种产品的切口分渣由手工操作改为机器生产，因为文化水平低，设计不出图纸，请工程师设计，工程师翻了半个月的书本，说是找不到资料不好办。这位老工人把这件事告诉了车间总支书记，在总支书记支持、鼓励下，他自己绘了一个草图，再请工程师帮助计算出机器传动、结构比例，终于创造自动切口分渣机，生产效率比手工提高了十多倍。
    这样做，也更有利于工人大闹技术革命。例如10月份工具车间任务很重，比9月份增加了四倍。各小组就大搞技术革新，提出了很多合理化建议，同时小组自己设计、自己绘图、自找材料，全月实现了革新项目一万多项，结果出色完成了任务。10月份，三车间工人自己改进设备和工艺规则，使十五道工序机器联动化，七道工序实现一机多用化，生产效率空前提高。全厂从8月份到10月份，工人们就自己制造土机器一百二十五部。
    过去，每个工人、小组和车间，只管完成本人和本单位的生产计划，遇到各单位的计划衔接不上的时候，一般只向领导反映，要求领导解决。现在，工人自己编制计划，对完成计划的自觉性和责任感大为加强，不仅千方百计地保证完成本人和本单位的计划，而且对全厂计划的完成也更加关心了，遇到其他单位有困难时，主动进行支援。
    长江电工厂是在推行庆华工具厂两参一改的经验，工人群众参加了生产小组的日常管理，干部参加劳动，破除了陈旧规章，精简了机构和表报等基础上采取这些措施的。在编制计划的具体作法上，他们采用了大搞群众运动的方法。每月月底，全厂召开职工大会，由党委书记讲目前形势，交代下月生产的产品品种、数量和时间要求，时时阐明完成任务的重大意义。紧接着每个工人按照车间提出的要求，编出个人的月度计划，并以个人计划为起点，逐级汇总、编制小组、车间以及全厂的作业计划，各级领导只是负责综合平衡。在编制计划的过程中，厂里还发动和组织了工人之间、小组之间、工段之间和车间之间的竞赛评比，掀起一个你追我赶的群众性的竞赛热潮。在发动工人群众参加技术管理的具体作法上，主要是把一些审批合理化建议、编制和改进工艺规程、产品质量检验等权力下放到生产小组。这些权力包括取消原来关于两百元以上的合理化建议小组不能决定的限制，只要不改变产品性能和有利于生产，用钱不加限制，小组自己执行
  （如果对实现建议没有把握，再请示领导决定）。其次，小组根据生产需要，可以在保证产品质量的原则下，自己编制和改变工艺规程。对于产品质量的检查，取消了原来每道工序、工种都由专职人员检验的制度，由工人自己组织检验。厂和车间领导，只最后鉴定整个成品的质量。
