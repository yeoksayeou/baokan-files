Vampire, Fence, and Noose
——On the "Political Star" of the Oil Dynasty, Nelson Rockefeller

    The Family of Vampires

    A powerful family is dominating the White House. The money-making ideology of one family has become the soul of American foreign policy. This family's name is Rockefeller. Now, this family has sent its "political star," Nelson Rockefeller, to the governor's seat of New York State. According to American election history, in the last eight American presidential elections, the governor of New York State has been nominated as a presidential candidate six times.

    Rockefeller - a name that is no stranger to people, and one of the most hated names. When people think of it, they associate it with the oil pipelines extending from America to various continents - the tentacles of Rockefeller. Wherever the tentacles reach, the firm suckers stick tightly, blood and profits flow to the United States, while poverty, death, and war are scattered everywhere.

    The Rockefeller family is synonymous with "war and death." The Rockefellers have nourished and strengthened themselves through war, that is, through the blood of humanity. John Rockefeller I, the first oil magnate, laid the cornerstone of this oil empire for the first time in the war in which the Northern Republicans opposed the Southern slave owners. "When the sea rises, it is easier to fish," this is the famous motto of the founder of this empire. World War I took the lives of ten million people, while the Rockefeller family made a net profit of $450 million. It earned $45 for each dead person. In World War II, 27 million people were sacrificed, while the Rockefeller family's books added $2.127 billion in revenue. Each dead person provided it with $78.80 in profit. This blood-drinking family relied on selling death to acquire $1 billion in half a century, and then increased its wealth by $2.1 billion in a large-scale war lasting less than five years. Now, it also controls American industries closely related to the military, such as aviation, electronics, military chemistry, and missiles.

    The Rockefeller family is a typical family of vampires, it understands the close relationship between "war and profit," and it wants to use the whole world as an object to make profits.

    Nelson Rockefeller, who grew up to be the family's "political star," is the result of following its "family education." From an early age, he understood the effectiveness of ledgers listing "income and expenditure." He imitated his grandfather and father, "recording his weekly allowance of twenty-five cents, extra income from raising rabbits and swatting flies (ten cents per hundred), and the use of this money in a ledger." The "family instructions" of the Rockefeller family are indeed unusual, requiring its children to remember firmly: "Every power implies a responsibility, every opportunity is an obligation, and every property is a task." Isn't it? Property has been written into the Rockefeller family's account books one after another, so the family's "task" is also increasing one by one. This made Nelson Rockefeller happy to say: "I never feel that being a Rockefeller is a burden." Another American, Theodore White, commented on this sentence as: "The responsibility of great wealth has never made him feel guilty or afraid."

    Thus, Nelson Rockefeller, due to the prominent family background of the oil empire, jumped into the American bureaucracy, and it was indeed smooth sailing.

    The "Fence" of Latin America

    The Rockefeller family in Latin America, of course, just like in other "continents," has its oil empire's territories. Nelson Rockefeller, this oil prince, could not help but inspect it. There, "he discovered that the difference in living standards between American oil mines and the outside world was like heaven and earth. Few American managers understood Spanish; as a result, their companies had little contact with the Latin American world on the other side of the fence." He further realized that "the United States itself did not have much contact with the south of its borders."

    The "fence" problem discovered in the Latin American territory made this oil prince ponder, and perhaps fear! Should the fence continue to be raised and strengthened, so that the Latin American people would eventually kick it down and uproot the oil dynasty? Or should the oil dynasty first "adopt a higher form of diplomacy" and prepare for a rainy day? Nelson Rockefeller believed that "this environment needs to be changed."

    The young oil prince spent three months learning Spanish. Not only that, he also formulated a new type of policy - a policy to "pull Latin America into the orbit of the United States." He believed that American capital must be combined with local forces in order for American rule to take root. The then American President Roosevelt adopted his suggestion and sent American loans to Latin America. Nelson Rockefeller was "appointed" as "Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs" and participated in government work.

    Three American presidents have "appointed" Nelson Rockefeller: Roosevelt, Truman, and the current Eisenhower. During Roosevelt's administration, the oil prince's title was "Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs"; under Truman, he was promoted to Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Latin American affairs, and later Director of the International Development Advisory Board; Eisenhower, who entered the White House with the behind-the-scenes support of the oil dynasty, successively "appointed" this prince as Director of the Federal Agency Adjustment Committee, Under Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare; and finally Special Assistant to the President for Foreign Policy. However, only God knows whether the oil prince serves the president or the presidents serve the oil dynasty. Have not many of the White House's policies in the last twenty years been stamped with the Rockefeller mark?

    Roosevelt resolved the "fence" problem discovered by the Rockefeller family during his tenure, and the American loans he sent were combined with "local forces" to "take root." Truman's famous "Point Four Program" was also the masterpiece of this young oil prince; and "Rockefellerism" is truly the soul of "Dulles-Eisenhowerism."

    In 1956, Nelson Rockefeller wrote a world-famous secret letter to his "President," in which he wrote: "Our policy must be both 'global' and 'total'; 'global' means including every part of the world, and 'total' means including political, psychological, economic, military, and special methods, and combining these methods into a whole. In other words, we must tie all our horses into a team."

    The Rockefeller dynasty has "global" goals. For this reason, it must "tie all its horses into a team," so that it is easier to control. It believes that "loans" and "military aid" are not enough, and the American government must intensify the implementation of the "massive retaliation" arms expansion and war preparation policy. Dulles, who was in charge of implementing this policy in the US State Department, was already one of the heads of the "Russian Military Trade Conference Branch" established by the American monopoly capital group in 1918 for "dividing" the Soviet Union. From that time on, he became a loyal servant of the Rockefeller family. At the same time, a modern history of American expansion also shows that the military flag follows the dollar, and the soldiers follow the military flag.

    However, the "appointed" official positions did not suit Nelson Rockefeller's appetite. He felt the necessity of directly controlling power. He expressed that "only those who are elected are listened to." Thus, the "political star" of the oil dynasty family participated in the New York gubernatorial election.

    Waved the Dollar Wand

    The American "Time" magazine put it well, "Rockefeller organized his campaign in the same way he founded a million-dollar South American enterprise." Nelson Rockefeller used the typical American method of business owners participating in elections. He waved the magic wand of the dollar at those who were useful to him and those who might hinder him. Dick Amper of the "New York Times" was "rented" to serve him at an annual salary of $25,000. As a result, the "New York Times" often published news favorable to Rockefeller. Truman was originally going to campaign for the Democrat Harriman, but the "Truman Library" received a $40,000 donation from Rockefeller, so he had to perfunctorily treat his old friend Harriman and give Rockefeller "a very light blow." According to statistics, Rockefeller spent $2 million on this election - a negligible figure for the oil dynasty's property, with each vote costing fifty cents. It is said that this is an unprecedented record in New York State election history. In this way, Nelson Rockefeller, in a "millionaire's battle," defeated the Democrat Harriman and ascended to the governorship of New York State - the richest man in America became the actual and nominal ruler of the richest state in America.

    Nelson Rockefeller's methods are quite similar to those of his grandfather. John Rockefeller I, the founder of the oil empire, not only focused his eyes on the blue checkered account book, but also established a complete and extensive economic and political intelligence agency in his newly created Mobil Oil Trust. Through this agency, he "was able to predict the objects of his opponents and see how to manipulate them. He was also able to probe the weaknesses of politicians and how to bribe them."

    Thus, not only now, but as early as the beginning of this century, important figures in the American Republican Party (and of course, many important figures in the Democratic Party) were subjects of the Rockefeller oil dynasty. In the United States, no other monopoly enterprise has so thoroughly placed its personnel in various positions in the American government as this dynasty. In this way, it has not only become the most powerful monopoly organization in the United States, but also intends to establish and expand this largest private economic world empire in history.

    However, for Nelson Rockefeller, the shadow of the "fence of Latin America" always lingered in his mind, and he worried that the "fence" would eventually become an uncontrollable volcano! He could not be satisfied with those garrulous finance ministers and budget directors (such as the so-called "government conservatives" like Humphrey and Dodge), whose vision was as narrow as beans, and who dared to say that Rockefeller's suggestions were "too bold" and "sometimes spent too much money." Nelson Rockefeller could only push them aside and come forward himself.

    Of course, the governorship of New York State is just a stepping stone.

    Shortly after Nelson Rockefeller was elected governor, a farce directed by retired Federal Judge Albert Levitt, "Elect Rockefeller as President," was launched in New Hampshire. Stassen, former disarmament adviser to President Eisenhower, also publicly announced "the list of four Republicans who could enter the White House in 1960," and the first was none other than the "political star" of this oil dynasty. Stassen also bet: "I believe the election results will prove that I am right." The oil dynasty will certainly not lack figures to act as stepping stones.

    Nelson Rockefeller surpasses his grandfather in that his ambition is so great that he wants to write "global" people into his account book by directly controlling political power!

    Of course, Nelson Rockefeller is also inferior to his grandfather in some ways. Now, the oil dynasty has not been able to tear down the fences it has erected anywhere, and the people on the other side of the fences have awakened. They have certainly suffered from the tentacles of Rockefeller, and they understand that the way to deal with these tentacles is to use a noose to trap them and tighten them from all directions!

    The sadness of the oil dynasty lies here! (Attached picture)

    吸血鬼·篱笆·绞索
    ——关于石油王朝的“政治明星”纳尔逊·洛克菲勒
    周倩萍
    吸血鬼的家族
    一个豪门在支配着白宫。一个家族的发财思想成了美国外交政策的灵魂。这个家族的名字就是洛克菲勒。现在，这个家族把它的“政治明星”纳尔逊·洛克菲勒送上了纽约州州长的宝座。根据美国选举史，人们就知道，在最近八次美国总统的选举中，有六次是纽约州长被提名为总统候选人的。
    洛克菲勒——人们对它并不陌生，它是人的名字中最为人所憎恨的一个。当人们想到它的时候，会联系到它的从美国伸向各个大陆的石油管——洛克菲勒的触须。触须伸到哪里，牢固的吸盘就粘着在哪里，鲜血和利润流往美国，而把贫穷、死亡和战争散布在各处。
    洛克菲勒家族是“战争和死亡”的同义语。洛克菲勒靠战争，也就是靠人类的鲜血，滋润了自己，壮大了自己。石油大王一世——约翰·洛克菲勒，在北方的共和党人反对南方的奴隶主的战争中第一次奠定了这个石油帝国的基石。“大海起了波涛，捕鱼就更容易”，这就是这个帝国创始人的有名的座右铭。第一次世界大战夺去了一千万人的生命，而洛克菲勒家族却获得净利四亿五千万美元。它在每个死者身上赚了四十五块美元。第二次世界大战，有二千七百万人牺牲了，而洛克菲勒家族的账簿上却增加了二十一亿两千七百万美元的收入。每个死者为它提供了七十八块八角美元的利润。这个喝人血的家族，靠着贩卖死亡，在半个世纪时间里才获得十亿美元，而在一个不到五年的大规模战争里就把它的财富增加了二十一亿美元。现在，它又控制了美国的航空、电子、军事化学和导弹等项同军事有密切关系的工业。
    洛克菲勒家族是一个典型的吸血鬼的家族，它懂得“战争和利润”的密切关系，它想把全世界作为赚取利润的对象。
    纳尔逊·洛克菲勒，成长为这个家族的“政治明星”，是沿袭着它的“家教”发展的结果。他从幼年时代就懂得了上面开列着“收入和支出”的账簿的功效。他摹仿着他的祖父和父亲，“在一个账本上记他每周二角五分的津贴，从养兔和打苍蝇（一百个一角钱）得到的额外收入，以及这些钱的用途”。洛克菲勒家族的“庭训”也的确不同平常，它要求它的子弟们牢牢地记住：“每一个权力就意味着一种责任，每一个机会是一种义务，每一笔财产是一种任务。”不是吗？财产一笔又一笔地写上洛克菲勒家族的账上了，因而这个家族的“任务”也在一种又一种地增加着。这使纳尔逊·洛克菲勒高兴地说：“我从来不感觉到作为一个洛克菲勒是一种负担”，这句话由另一个美国人西奥多·怀特注释是：“大财富的责任从来没有使他感到有罪或害怕”。
    这样，纳尔逊·洛克菲勒，由于石油帝国的显赫的家世，他跳进了美国的宦海，而且的确是一帆风顺。
    拉丁美洲的“篱笆”
    洛克菲勒家族在拉丁美洲，当然也如同在其他“洲”一样，有它的石油帝国的领地。纳尔逊·洛克菲勒这个石油王子断不了去那里视察一番。在那里，“他发现了美国石油矿地和外界之间生活水准的差别犹如天壤。懂西班牙文的美国经理没有几个；结果，他们的公司同篱笆那一边的拉丁美洲世界没有什么联系”。他还进一步认识到，“美国自己同国境南面的接触也不多”。
    在拉丁美洲的领地上发现的“篱笆”问题使这位石油王子陷于苦思，也可能陷于恐惧！是继续加高加固这个篱笆因而让拉丁美洲人民最后来踹平它并且连石油王朝的根子拔掉呢？还是由石油王朝先“采用更高形式的外交政策”，未雨绸缪呢？纳尔逊·洛克菲勒认为，“这个环境需要加以改变”。
    年青的石油王子用三个月的时间学会了西班牙文。不止于此，他还制订了一种新型的政策——要“把拉丁美洲拉向美国的轨道”的政策，他认为必须使美国的资本和当地势力结合起来，美国的统治才能落地生根。当时的美国总统罗斯福采纳了他的意见，向拉丁美洲送去了美国的贷款。纳尔逊·洛克菲勒被“委任”为“美洲事务协调人”，参加了政府工作。
    美国的三位总统“委任”过纳尔逊·洛克菲勒，他们是罗斯福、杜鲁门和现任的艾森豪威尔。在罗斯福当政的年代里，这位石油王子的职衔是“美洲事务协调人”；在杜鲁门的治下，他就高升为专管拉丁美洲事务的助理国务卿，后来又是国际开发顾问局局长；由于石油王朝的幕后支持而进入了白宫的艾森豪威尔又先后“委任”这位王子为联邦机构调整委员会主任、卫生教育和福利部副部长；最后是总统的外交政策特别助理。不过，真是只有上帝才知道，究竟是石油王子为总统服务，还是总统们为石油王朝服务。白宫的政策在最近的二十年中，有许多不都是烙上了洛克菲勒的标记吗？
    罗斯福任内把洛克菲勒家族发现的“篱笆”问题解决了，他送去的美国贷款跟“当地势力”结合起来“生根”了。杜鲁门的有名的“第四点计划”，也正是这位年青的石油王子的杰作；而“洛克菲勒主义”才真正是“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”的灵魂。
    1956年，纳尔逊·洛克菲勒给他的“总统”写了一封闻名世界的秘信，他写道：“我们的政策必须既是‘全球的’又是‘总体的’；所谓‘全球的’是指要包括全世界每一个部分，所谓‘总体的’是指要包括政治、心理、经济、军事和特别的方法，而把这些方法结合为一个整体。换句话说，要把我们所有的马匹都拴成一队。”
    洛克菲勒王朝，有着“全球的”目标。为此，它必须把“所有的马匹都拴成一队”，这样驾驭就更方便些。它认为，“贷款”、“军援”还不够，美国政府还必须加紧执行“大规模报复”的扩军备战方针。在美国国务院里执行这种方针的是杜勒斯，他早在1918年就是美国垄断资本集团为“瓜分”苏联而设立的“俄罗斯军事贸易会议分会”的头子之一，也就是从这个时候起，他就成了洛克菲勒家族的忠仆。同时，美国一部现代扩张史也说明：军旗跟着美元，士兵跟着军旗。
    但是，“委任”的官儿并不合纳尔逊·洛克菲勒的胃口。他感觉到了自己直接掌握权力的必要性。他表示过，“只有那些当选的人讲的话才有人听从”。于是，石油王朝家族的“政治明星”参加了纽约州长的竞选。
      挥起了美元魔杖
    美国“时代”周刊说得好，“洛克菲勒用他创办百万美元南美企业同样的办法组织了他的竞选活动”。纳尔逊·洛克菲勒使用的是企业主参加选举的典型美国方法。他对那些对他有用和可能妨碍他的人，就举起美元这根如意的魔杖。“纽约时报”的迪克·安普尔就是以年薪两万五千美元的价格“出租”给他效劳的。“纽约时报”因此就经常刊登有利于洛克菲勒的消息。杜鲁门本来是要为民主党人哈里曼竞选的，但是“杜鲁门图书馆”收到了洛克菲勒四万美元的赠款，于是他只好敷衍一下他的老友哈里曼，仅仅给了洛克菲勒“一个很轻的打击”。据统计，洛克菲勒为这次竞选花掉了二百万美元——对于石油王朝的财产来说这只算是一个微不足道的数字，每张选票代价是美金五角。据说，这是纽约州选举史上的空前纪录。这样，纳尔逊·洛克菲勒，在一场“百万富翁的战斗”中击败了民主党人哈里曼，登上了纽约州州长的宝座——美国最富有的人当了美国最富有的一个州实际上也是名义上的统治者。
    纳尔逊·洛克菲勒的活动手法颇有乃祖遗风。约翰·洛克菲勒一世，开创了石油帝国，就不仅仅只是把眼光落在蓝色格格的账本上，他初创的美孚油托辣斯里就设立了一个完备而广泛的经济和政治情报机构，通过这个机构，他“能够预测他的敌手的对象，并看出如何摆布他们。他也能够探悉政治家的弱点以及如何贿赂他们。”
  这样，不止是现在，早在本世纪初，美国共和党里的重要人物（当然也有民主党的不少重要人物），就是洛克菲勒石油王朝的臣属。在美国，也没有任何其他垄断企业像这个王朝这样彻底地把它的人员安插到美国政府的各个岗位上。这样，它不仅变成了美国国内最有力的垄断组织，而且也还打算建立和扩张这个历史上最大的私人经济世界帝国。
    但是，对于纳尔逊·洛克菲勒来说，“拉丁美洲的篱笆”这一道阴影始终在他的脑海里盘旋，他担心“篱笆”终究会变成爆发得不可收拾的火山！他不能满意那些喋喋不休的财政部长和预算局长们（如汉弗莱和道奇之流的所谓“政府保守派人士”），他们眼光如豆，居然敢说洛克菲勒的建议“太大胆”，“有时花钱太多”。纳尔逊·洛克菲勒只有把他们推向一边，自己出马。
    当然，纽约州长不过是一个阶梯。
    在纳尔逊·洛克菲勒当选州长不久以后，一个由退休的联邦法官艾伯特·勒法特导演的
  “选洛克菲勒当总统”的闹剧就在新罕布什尔揭幕了。艾森豪威尔总统的前裁军问题顾问史塔生也公开宣布了“能够在1960年进入白宫的四位共和党人的名单”，第一位不是别人，恰恰就是这个石油王朝的“政治明星”。史塔生还打赌说：“我相信选举的结果证明我是对的。”石油王朝当然不会缺少充当踏脚石的人物的。
    纳尔逊·洛克菲勒有胜过乃祖的地方，他的野心大到想通过直接掌握政权把“全球的”人写入他的账本！
    当然，纳尔逊·洛克菲勒也有不如乃祖的地方。现在，石油王朝并没有在任何地方能够拆掉它自己竖立起来的篱笆，而且篱笆那边的人们醒悟过来了。他们当然吃过洛克菲勒的触须的苦头，他们明白了，对付这种触须的办法就是用绞索把它套住，从四面八方勒紧！
    石油王朝的悲哀就在这里！（附图片）
