The Cairo "Al-Ahram" published an editorial on the 6th, pointing out that Dulles' notorious "brink of war" policy was the reason for the failure of the US Republican Party in the congressional elections. The newspaper also said that this policy was against the will of the people and has been fiercely criticized everywhere; his domestic policy has also suffered a complete failure.

The Paris "L'Humanité" wrote on the 6th that the Republican Party's failure in the election undeniably reflects the growing unease of most American voters with Dulles' repeated failures and adventurist foreign policy, and with the disturbing economic recession in the United States.

"Combat" said that in terms of foreign policy, world opinion will note that Dulles has been judged by his compatriots, and the majority condemned his policies.

The London "Times" commented on the 6th that the US government's "handling of the Formosa (Taiwan) crisis has been criticized by many powerful groups," which is one of the reasons for the Republican Party's failure.

Essen's "Report" in West Germany wrote that the main reasons for the Republican Party's failure were the domestic economic recession (crisis) and Dulles' pursuit of the "brink of war" policy, especially in the Far East.

Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Washington correspondent Minifie said on the 5th that the main reason for the Republican Party's failure was the widespread dissatisfaction in the United States with Dulles' foreign policy, because Dulles' provocative activities have more than once pushed the United States to the brink of a new world war.

An Associated Press dispatch from London wrote: People in Western Europe believe that Nolan's failure clearly proves that Americans are dissatisfied with the policy of supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

    选举结果标志着美国内外政策破产
    杜勒斯对中国挑衅政策丧尽人心
    开罗“金字塔报”6日发表社论指出，杜勒斯的臭名远扬的“战争边缘”政策是美国共和党在国会选举中失败的原因。这家报纸又说，这种政策是违反人民的意志的，在各地遭到了激烈的批评；他的国内政策也遭到了完全的失败。
    巴黎“人道报”6日写道，共和党在选举中的失败，不容争辩地反映出大部分美国选民对杜勒斯一再失败和冒险主义的外交政策，对在美国出现的令人不安的经济衰退，愈来愈不安。
    “战斗报”说，在外交政策上，世界舆论将要注意的是：杜勒斯受到他的同胞的审判，大多数人谴责他的政策。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”6日的评论认为，美国政府“处理福摩萨（台湾）危机的方式受到了许多有力集团的批评”，这是招致共和党失败的原因之一。
    西德埃森的“汇报”写道，共和党失败的主要原因是国内的经济衰退（危机）以及杜勒斯推行“战争边缘”政策、特别是在远东推行这个政策等。
    加拿大广播公司驻华盛顿记者米尼菲5日说，共和党失败的主要原因是美国普遍对杜勒斯的外交政策不满，因为杜勒斯的挑衅活动不止一次地把美国推上了新的世界大战边缘。
    美联社从伦敦发出的一条消息写道：西欧的人们认为，诺兰的失败清楚地证明了，美国人不满意支持蒋介石集团的政策。
