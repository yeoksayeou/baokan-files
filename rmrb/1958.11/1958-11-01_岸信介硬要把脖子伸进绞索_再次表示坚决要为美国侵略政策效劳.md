Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 31st: Japanese Socialist Party member, Isumi Isamu, questioned the scope of the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" at the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 30th, revealing Kishi Nobusuke's willingness to serve the US war policy and make Japan a member of the "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization," an instrument of US aggression.

Isumi questioned Kishi Nobusuke on whether the scope of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" includes Okinawa. He pointed out that if Okinawa is included, and actions are taken based on the "treaties" between the United States and Syngman Rhee, and the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, Okinawa will become a common battlefield, and Japan must take action based on the Japan-US "Security Treaty," which is effectively forming an anti-communist alliance of the "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization."

Isumi pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea will not last long, and the US "strategic line" will only retreat backward, and in the future, only Japan will be dragged into the US strategic system.

Kishi Nobusuke always evaded the question of whether the Japan-US military treaty applies to Okinawa. He does not think that Japan sending troops to Okinawa is an act of sending troops abroad, and he tried his best to quibble, saying that if the new Japan-US military treaty includes Okinawa, it has no connection with the US-Rhee and US-Chiang "treaties." However, Hayashi Shuzo, Director-General of his Cabinet Legislation Bureau, admitted at the meeting that the scope of the US-Rhee and US-Chiang "treaties" includes both Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands.

Kishi Nobusuke also expressed his determination to rely on the United States. He said that he would implement "joint defense" with the United States no matter what. He did not deny that Japan would continue to give privileges to the US military stationed in Japan. He said that Japan has to consider providing military bases to the United States. Kishi Nobusuke revealed that he will strive to reach an agreement with the United States as soon as possible so that the new Japan-US military treaty can be submitted to the Diet meeting to be held early next year for approval.

    岸信介硬要把脖子伸进绞索
    再次表示坚决要为美国侵略政策效劳
    新华社31日讯　东京消息：日本社会党议员今澄勇30日在众议院预算委员会就修改中的日美“安全条约”的适用范围问题进行了质询，揭露了岸信介甘心为美国战争政策效劳，使日本成为美国侵略工具的“东北亚条约组织”的一员的阴谋。
    今澄质问岸信介日美“安全条约”的适用范围是否包括冲绳。他指出，如果包括冲绳在内，要是根据美国同李承晚、美国同蒋介石的“条约”采取行动，冲绳就将成为共同的战场，日本就必须根据日美“安全条约”采取行动，这实际就是组成“东北亚条约组织”的反共同盟。
    今澄指出，台湾的蒋介石集团和南朝鲜的李承晚集团的寿命都不会长，美国的“战略线”将只会向后撤退，将来只有日本被卷入美国的战略体系里去。
    岸信介对于日美军事条约是否适用于冲绳的问题始终闪烁其辞，他不认为日本派兵到冲绳去是派兵出国的行为，他并且竭力进行诡辩，说新的日美军事条约如果包括冲绳在内，也同美李、美蒋“条约”没有联系。可是他的内阁法制局长官林修三在会上承认：美李、美蒋“条约”的范围都包括冲绳和小笠原群岛在内。
    岸信介还表示了他坚决投靠美国的态度。他说，无论如何也要同美国实行“联防”。他不否认日本将继续给驻日美军以特权，他说，日本不得不考虑向美国提供军事基地。岸信介透露，他将努力迅速同美国达成协议，以便使新的日美军事条约能够在明年初举行的国会会议上提出，求得批准。
