Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: The military delegation of the People's Republic of Albania, headed by General Baluku, returned home by special plane at 2:00 PM today after concluding its visit to our country.

At 1:40 PM, a welcoming crowd stood in neat rows at the Capital Airport. General Baluku, accompanied by General Huang Kecheng, Deputy Minister of National Defense and Chief of the General Staff, reviewed the guard of honor.

General Baluku delivered a farewell speech, saying, "Today we are about to leave your beautiful and hospitable country. On behalf of all members of the Albanian military delegation, I would like to thank you once again for your warm and brotherly reception. During our visit to your country, we felt as though we were living among close comrades and true brothers, which we will never forget."

General Baluku also praised the new and brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people and the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army in socialist construction and national defense construction.

General Huang Kecheng said in his farewell speech, "We are here to bid farewell to our distinguished guests with infinite respect and reluctance. Although your visit to our country was short, you warmly cared about our country's socialist construction, you deeply loved the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and you justly condemned the US imperialism's aggression against our country. This great internationalist spirit and sincere brotherly friendship have left an extremely profound and unforgettable impression on the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Your visit has made a significant contribution to strengthening the mutual understanding between the people and armies of China and Albania and enhancing the unity and friendship between the two peoples and armies."
