In 1958, the 600 million Chinese people launched a comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Great changes have taken place in all aspects; the formerly slow pace has soared, the formerly backward are catching up, and people's political and ideological outlook has greatly changed. This is true for all provinces and regions in the country, and it is also true for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

This year's Great Leap Forward has broken a heavy ideological shackle. This is the theory of Inner Mongolia's backwardness. Some people have not learned from the great achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's ten years of construction. They always fail to see the great power of the people of all ethnic groups who have raised their socialist consciousness under the leadership of the Party. They always think that Inner Mongolia is relatively weak and can only follow in the footsteps of others, and that faster development is impossible. This view is wrong. Facts have proved that under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's General Line, the nine million people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region, as long as they thoroughly break superstitions and liberate their minds, can also bring about earth-shaking changes. Water conservancy construction is a good example. This year, the irrigated area of ​​farmland in Inner Mongolia increased by 12.29 million mu in less than a year, which is more than the total irrigated area in Inner Mongolia's history. The leap forward plan for a total grain output of 10 billion jin has been overfulfilled by 28%, more than doubling that of last year. Animal husbandry has realized cooperation, overcome various serious natural disasters last year, and achieved high-speed development. The view that the net increase rate during the Second Five-Year Plan could only be around 5% has been broken. This year, the net increase rate reached 12.06%, and it may reach 25% next year. The nationwide campaign to run industry has begun to yield results. Local industry has overfulfilled the annual output value plan three months ahead of schedule. If state-owned enterprises are included, the task of doubling industrial production has been achieved. In terms of culture and education, after a year of hard work by the whole people, illiteracy has been basically eliminated and primary and secondary education has been basically popularized. Many areas have basically achieved "four zeros," and technological innovations and creations are also booming rapidly. All this fully illustrates a truth: under the leadership of the Party, as long as the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region fully promote communist ideas and dare to think and act, all pessimistic views on development prospects and speed are untenable.

Thoroughly breaking the theory of backwardness and laying the foundation for leap forward confidence is not only significant in greatly promoting the construction speed of the Autonomous Region, but also in establishing an ideological foundation for the common development and common prosperity of all ethnic groups on the road of socialist construction. In the big family of socialism, is it possible for ethnic minority areas and ethnic minorities to keep pace with advanced areas and advanced nationalities? Can they carry out construction at the same high speed, or even at a higher speed, to gradually eliminate the differences between nationalities? Can they strive for advancement in the struggle to accelerate socialist construction and actively prepare conditions for the transition to a communist society? These are ideological problems that the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region must solve in the leap forward under the new situation. According to the experience of the past year, whether in theory, ideology, or practice, it is already possible to answer this question, that is, "it is entirely possible."

The comprehensive Great Leap Forward is rapidly and fundamentally changing the face of the Autonomous Region. Like most provinces and regions in the country, the agricultural areas of Inner Mongolia have realized people's communes at the end of September. The major reform of production relations has brought new content to the new relations of unity and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups. In the people's communes, which comprehensively develop agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and integrate industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, the connections between people of all ethnic groups in production and life are closer, cooperation is strengthened, estrangement is further eliminated, and differences are becoming smaller and smaller. This has created extremely favorable conditions for greater leap forward in the future. A greater leap forward in production and the high development of economy and culture will lay the foundation for the gradual disappearance of differences among all ethnic groups and their trend towards integration. For example, the Xinguang Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Jungar Banner has only 47 laborers. In the Great Leap Forward, thanks to the technical guidance of Han farmers, it has increased 210 mu of paddy fields this year, with an average of 3 mu per person, which is no different from agricultural cooperatives. Some agricultural cooperatives in Supuhan Township in the same banner have an average of 10 livestock per person, which is almost the same as the number per person in the banner's animal husbandry cooperatives. It can be predicted that after the establishment of people's communes, agricultural and animal husbandry cooperatives will merge into one, transforming from support to integration, and the differences between Mongolian and Han people in production will soon disappear. After eliminating Mongolian illiteracy, herdsmen in Wushen Banner began to eliminate Han illiteracy. Similarly, it can be predicted that the victory of the cultural revolution will gradually eliminate the cultural differences between Mongolian and Han people and achieve common prosperity and common improvement. From small to large, the relationship between the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and advanced regions in the country can be inferred in the same way. Further developing economic cooperation, more frequent cultural exchanges, mutual assistance, mutual learning, common development, and common prosperity among all ethnic groups will inevitably consolidate the new ethnic relations, make all ethnic groups closer, and gradually achieve the complete elimination of ethnic boundaries. Obviously, the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the Autonomous Region's construction in 1958 pointed out a concrete path for the common development and common prosperity of all ethnic groups. This is the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's General Line for socialist construction.

Currently, we are in a new historical period. All fraternal ethnic groups in the country are striving to achieve common development and common prosperity on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, and are preparing conditions for the transition to a communist society on the basis of a greater leap forward in production and construction and a greater improvement in communist consciousness. To successfully realize this historical task, under the leadership of the Party, we must strengthen the great unity and great cooperation of all ethnic groups, so that the political, economic, cultural, and spiritual connections between all ethnic groups become increasingly close, and that the mass movement continues to surge, fully unleashing the wisdom and strength of the people of all ethnic groups. To this end, our people of all ethnic groups must unite as one, keep pace, strive for advancement, work hard and practically, and strive to comprehensively realize this year's leap forward tasks and ensure an even greater leap forward next year. We must realize the common development and common prosperity of all ethnic groups with the spirit of striving for advancement and surpassing the predecessors.

    并驾齐驱  力争上游
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会宣传部部长　胡昭衡
    1958年，六亿中国人民放出一个全面大跃进的卫星。一切方面都发生了大变化，原来速度很慢的腾空而起，原来落后的迎头赶上，人们的政治思想面貌变化很大。全国各省区是这样，内蒙古自治区也是这样。
    今年的大跃进，打破了一个沉重的思想枷锁。这就是内蒙古落后论。有些人并未从内蒙古自治区十周年建设取得伟大成就的事实中取得教训，总看不到在党领导下提高了社会主义觉悟的各族人民的伟大力量，总认为内蒙古比较差劲，只能踏着别人的脚跟走路，更快的发展是不行的。这种看法是错误的，事实证明：在毛泽东思想和党的总路线的光辉照耀下，自治区九百万各族人民，只要彻底破除迷信，解放思想，同样可以来一个翻天覆地的变化。水利建设就是一个很好的例证。今年内蒙古农田灌溉面积不到一年就增加了一千二百二十九万亩，比内蒙古历史上所有灌溉面积总和还要多。粮食总产量一百亿斤的跃进计划，超额28％完成了，比去年加了一番还多。畜牧业实现了合作化，战胜了去年各种严重自然灾害，获得高速度发展。许多人认为第二个五年计划期间纯增率只能是5％左右的观点被打破了，今年纯增率达到12.06％，明年还有可能达到25％。全民大办工业已开始获得效果，地方工业已提前三个月超额完成全年产值计划，如果包括国营企业在内，已实现了工业生产翻一番的任务。文化教育方面，经过全民一年奋战，已经基本上扫除文盲、基本普及了中、小学教育，许多地区基本实现了“四无”，技术上的革新创造也一日千里的蓬勃发展。这一切充分说明一个真理：自治区各族人民，在党的领导下，只要充分发扬共产主义思想，敢想敢干，一切在发展前途和速度方面的悲观论调，都是站不住脚的。
    彻底打破落后论，奠定跃进信心，其意义还不仅仅在于大大促进了自治区的建设速度，而且还为各族人民在社会主义建设道路上共同发展和共同繁荣确立了思想基础。在社会主义的大家庭里，民族地区和少数民族有可能和先进地区和先进民族并驾齐驱么？能以同样高速度、甚至以更高的速度来进行建设而达到各民族间的差别逐渐消失么？能在加速社会主义建设并且为过渡到共产主义社会积极准备条件的斗争中，力争上游么？这些都是新形势下内蒙古自治区各族人民在跃进中必须解决的思想问题。根据一年来的经验，不论在理论上、思想上或在实践上，都已经可以回答这个问题了，这就是“完全有可能”。
    全面大跃进正迅速从根本上改变着自治区的面貌。和全国多数省区一样，内蒙古农业区在9月底已经实现了人民公社化。生产关系的重大改革给各民族团结互助新关系带来了新的内容。在农、牧、林、副、渔全面发展，工、农、商、学、兵互相结合的人民公社中，各族人民在生产和生活上的联系更密切了，协作更加强了，隔阂进一步消除了，差别越来越少了，这就为今后的更大跃进创造了极其有利的条件。生产的更大跃进和经济文化的高度发展，又会为各民族间的差别逐步消失并趋向融合一体奠定基础。例如郡王旗新光牧业社，只有四十七个劳动力，在大跃进中，由于得到汉族农民弟兄的技术指导，今年一年就增加了二百一十亩水地，平均每人三亩水地，已和农业社没有什么区别；而该旗苏泊汉乡有些农业社每人平均有十头牲畜，和该旗牧业社的每人占有数也差不多。可以预料，成立人民公社后，农业社、牧业社将会合为一体，由支援变成结合，蒙汉人民在生产方面的差别就很快消失了。乌审旗牧民在扫除蒙文文盲之后，又开始扫除汉文文盲，同样可以预计，文化革命的胜利将使蒙汉人民在文化方面的差别也要逐步消失，而达到共同繁荣和共同提高。由小及大，内蒙古自治区和全国先进地区的关系也可以依此类推。各民族之间，进一步开展经济大协作，更频繁的文化交流，互相帮助，互相学习，共同发展，共同繁荣，这就必然使新的民族关系更加巩固，各民族更加亲密无间，逐步达到民族界限完全消除。显然，1958年自治区建设全面大跃进给各族人民指明一条共同发展和共同繁荣的具体道路，这是毛泽东思想和党的社会主义建设总路线的辉煌胜利。
    当前，我们正处在一个新的历史时期，国内各兄弟民族正在社会主义建设大跃进的基础上，努力实现共同发展和共同繁荣，并为在生产建设更大跃进和共产主义觉悟更大提高的基础上，为向共产主义社会过渡准备条件。要胜利地实现这一历史任务，必须在党的领导下，加强民族大团结与民族大协作，使各民族之间的政治、经济、文化与精神联系日益紧密，并且使群众运动不断高涨，充分发挥各族人民的智慧和力量。为此，我们各族人民必须团结一致，并驾齐驱，争先恐后，苦干实干，为全面实现今年跃进任务并保证明年更大跃进而奋斗。我们要以力争上游和后来者可以居上的精神实现各民族的共同发展和共同繁荣。
