Never Leave the "Group"
    Chen Zhiyan

    After two months of hard work by the tens of millions of the iron and steel army across the country, the situation on China's iron and steel front has changed. The issue of quantity is no longer significant. The current problem is to focus on quality and consolidate and improve the "small-scale indigenous groups."

    This change has extremely significant meaning. It signifies that we have found a path that combines Marxism with China's reality in the issue of industrialization. This is the path of combining small-scale indigenous groups with large-scale foreign groups. Small-scale indigenous groups and large-scale foreign groups soar together, and thus we were able to obtain 1.87 million tons of steel in October alone. This change fully demonstrates that we will definitely be able to obtain 10.7 million tons of steel before the end of December this year.

    The "small-scale indigenous groups" have achieved a great victory. Now they are facing the second battle—consolidating the small-scale indigenous groups, improving the small-scale indigenous groups, and striving for greater victories.

    Today's China is a China that is changing rapidly. Anyone whose thinking cannot keep up will likely fall behind step by step. Just two months ago, some comrades still doubted whether we could obtain 10.7 million tons of steel this year. After the tens of millions of worker-peasant steel armies went into action, high-yield steel satellites rose one after another. Objective reality tells people that as long as the masses are mobilized, the task of 10.7 million tons of steel can be completed by the end of the year. Facts conquered the doubts of these comrades.

    The power of the masses is enormous and infinite. We often say this. However, it is not easy for people to completely believe in the power of the masses. Some people who initially did not believe that the mass movement could obtain 10.7 million tons of steel now believe it. However, they have new arguments: the quality of indigenous iron and steel is still problematic. To improve quality, we need technology and equipment, which is difficult to handle. In essence, they still do not believe that the masses have a strong sense of responsibility for improving the quality of steel production, and they do not believe that the masses can solve the problem of improving the small-scale indigenous groups. Here, their thinking has fallen behind again. Before long, they will find that the small-scale indigenous groups are no longer the original small-scale indigenous groups. They will rise step by step. From today's tens of millions of steel armies, thousands upon thousands of new communist people will emerge who master the technology of small-scale and medium-scale foreign iron and steelmaking and also know how to achieve high yields of wheat and rice. By that time, those who doubt that ordinary peasants cannot improve the small-scale indigenous groups in terms of quality and technology will feel somewhat ashamed again.

    There is every reason to believe that today's small-scale indigenous groups will one day be armed with modern technology. Today, those who cannot distinguish between stones and ores will one day become experts in blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. However, its every step of progress is inseparable from the mass movement. Never leave the "group," this is our guiding principle for running industry. From this point of view, we feel that today's publication in this newspaper of the large-scale technical innovation movement centered on improving steel quality in Hunan, Zunyi, Guizhou, and other places is of great significance. Improving the small-scale indigenous groups is also not an easy task. It requires extremely arduous work, the most fundamental of which is to carry out the mass movement on a large scale. By truly practicing this, the improvement of the small-scale indigenous groups will advance at a rapid pace.

    永不离“群”
    陈之衍
    经过全国几千万钢铁大军的两月奋战，我国钢铁战线上的形势起了变化，数量的问题已经不大了，当前的问题是抓质量，抓“小土群”的巩固和提高。
    这个变化有着极其巨大的意义，它标志着：在工业化的问题上我们找到了一条马克思主义和我国实际相结合的道路。这就是小土群和大洋群相结合的道路。小土群和大洋群比翼齐飞，于是我们就能够在10月份一个月内拿到一百八十七万吨钢，这个变化充分说明了：在今年12月底以前我们一定能够拿到一千零七十万吨钢。
      “小土群”出师大捷，现在它正面临着第二次战役——巩固小土群，提高小土群，争取更大的胜利。
    今天的中国，是一个瞬夕万变的中国，谁的思想要是一步赶不上，就可能步步赶不上。仅仅两个月以前，有些同志还怀疑能不能在今年拿到一千零七十万吨钢，等到几千万亦工亦农的钢铁大军上阵以后，钢铁高产卫星一个接着一个升起，客观实际告诉人们：只要群众运动起来，一千零七十万吨钢的任务是可以在年底完成的。事实征服了这些同志的怀疑。
    群众的力量是巨大的无穷的。我们常常这样说。然而要人们彻底的相信群众的力量，还不是一件很容易的事。有一些开始时不大相信群众运动起来就能拿到一千零七十万吨钢的人，现在相信了。可是，他们有了新的议论：土铁土钢的质量还是有问题呀，要提高质量，就需要技术、需要装备，这就难办了。究其实，仍然是不相信群众对提高钢铁生产的质量有强烈的责任心，不相信群众能够解决小土群的提高问题。在这里他们的思想又落后了一步。不要太久，他们就会发现小土群已不是原来的小土群，他们会一步步地上升，从今天的几千万钢铁大军中，将会涌现出成千上万掌握小洋群、中洋群的炼铁炼钢的技术又懂得怎样让麦子和稻子高产的共产主义新人。到那个时候，那些怀疑普通的农民不能从质量上技术上来提高小土群的人，就又会觉得有些惭愧了。
    完全有理由相信，今天的小土群，有一天会用现代技术武装起来。今天那些分不清石头和矿石的人，有一天会成为高炉和马丁炉的专家。然而它的每一步进展，都离不开群众运动。永不离“群”，这就是我们办工业的方针。从这一点说，我们觉得今天本报发表的湖南、贵州遵义等地大搞以提高钢铁质量为中心的技术革新运动，是有很重要的意义的。提高小土群也不是轻而易举的，它需要进行极其艰巨的工作，其中最根本的是大搞群众运动，真正实践了这一条，小土群的提高就会以快速的步伐前进。
