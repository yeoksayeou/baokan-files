    The Central Committee of the Iranian People's Party has issued a statement condemning the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

    The statement points out that many arguments presented in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, even in the current revised version, violate the points of the declaration of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and the Declaration of Peace (which was also signed by the Yugoslav representative). That is to say, it violates the documents accepted by the communist and workers' parties of all countries, including the Iranian People's Party. The content, main spirit, and general line of the draft program violate many Marxist-Leninist propositions and constitute erroneous views that revise the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

    The statement said that, in our opinion, under the influence of bourgeois nationalist tendencies and due to an incorrect understanding and underestimation of proletarian internationalism, the Yugoslav leaders have long turned to the path of revising many Marxist-Leninist principles, the correctness of which has been confirmed by experience and practice. Therefore, the central issue that was used in every way to confuse the public at the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is proletarian internationalism.

    The statement points out that, at present, the main characteristics of proletarian internationalism are actions aimed at consolidating and strengthening the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and actions aimed at consolidating and strengthening the unity of all new types of workers' parties, centered on the Soviet Union, leading the conscious struggle of the democratic classes for peace, democracy, and socialism. There is no doubt that all those who are truly concerned about the most rapid and complete victory of the socialist ideal understand that the urgent need and important guarantee in the face of the united front of capitalist monopoly organizations is the unbreakable unity of the working class of the world. The statement said that the imperialists, headed by the American imperialists, are stubbornly trying to undermine the unity of the socialist camp today. It is easy for every revolutionary to understand that such subversive activities of imperialism must be opposed, but the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the speeches of the leaders of this alliance at the Congress did not have such a clear orientation.

    The statement talked about the draft program presented at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which revised many basic principles of Marxism. The draft program describes state-monopoly capitalism as one of the different forms of society's inevitable transition to socialism, thus distorting the important Marxist-Leninist principle of regarding the capitalist state as the agent and executor of capitalist dictatorship.

    The draft program considers the development of international economic relations, even economic relations between imperialist countries, as an integral part of the socialist road of world economic development, thus blurring the clear concept of the "world socialist economic system" and preparing an excuse for the political and social consequences arising from this ambiguity. The draft program denies the existence of two opposing camps—the socialist camp and the imperialist camp—and confuses the concept of the socialist camp with the vague concepts of "socialist tendencies" and "socialist forces." Instead of using the concept of "two camps"—an important objective truth and the main characteristic of the modern era—the draft program uses the concept of "two blocs" to compare the two and claims that Yugoslavia stands outside the two blocs. Denying the existence of the socialist camp, a strong fortress of peace, democracy, and progress, and using the concept of two blocs to obscure this important fact is an extremely serious sophistry in determining the current situation and a repetition of the analyses commonly made by capitalist ideologues.

    The draft program regards the dictatorship of the proletariat as "bureaucratic state totalitarianism" and, regardless of certain positive opinions, raises the question of the rapid demise of the state after the "consolidation of the workers' class regime," thus practically underestimating the important task of strengthening the socialist state as long as the danger of foreign capitalist aggression and the danger of domestic capitalist restoration have not been eliminated. The draft program also underestimates the role of the new type of workers' party in preparing the socialist transformation of society and in socialist construction.

    The statement then refuted Tito's nonsense of praising "US aid" and touting the United States as an "effective factor" in stopping aggression. The statement said that today, American imperialism plays the role of international gendarme; it helps enslavers and oppressors everywhere to suppress the people of all countries. This sophistical position in analyzing international problems cannot be considered a Marxist-Leninist, revolutionary position.

    The statement emphasized that the purpose of the Yugoslav leaders in formulating such a program is actually to create ideological confusion in the international revolutionary workers' movement. Therefore, it is necessary for the communist and workers' parties of all countries that are concerned about unity and Marxist-Leninist purity to raise criticism.

    The Central Committee of the Iranian People's Party believes that one of the reasons for the internationally significant achievements of Marxists-Leninists is that they have never permitted vagueness and confusion in ideological issues and have paid special attention to whether their line is clear, absolutely reliable, and scientific, and whether their ideological weapons are sharp.

    The statement said that the international revolutionary movement advancing under the banner of Marxism-Leninism could never have achieved such great economic, social, political, and moral achievements on a global scale, nor could it have achieved new achievements every day and inflicted new defeats on the international capitalist front, if it had relied on a pile of rigid, dogmatic principles that are not connected with reality, as the Yugoslav leaders said. In short, there is a clear difference between the revolutionary creativity of Marxism-Leninism and the revisionism of revising Marxist guiding principles.

    The statement finally said that the drafters of the draft program and its defenders arrogantly say that they are fighting against dogmatism. The Marxist-Leninist principles that have been "revised" in the draft program are summaries of the living experience of the movement. The correctness of these principles has been repeatedly confirmed in the revolutionary practice of the masses and in the actual construction of a strong and magnificent socialist economy and culture. Relying on principles that have been historically proven to be correct is not dogmatism, but abandoning these principles is precisely revisionism.

### 伊朗人民党中央谴责南共纲领  铁托集团想用诡辩混淆视听

    伊朗人民党中央谴责南共纲领
    铁托集团想用诡辩混淆视听
    本报讯　伊朗人民党中央委员会曾经发表谴责南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案的声明。
    声明指出，在南共纲领草案中，甚至在现在的修改稿中所提出的许多论点，违背了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和和平宣言（南斯拉夫代表也在和平宣言上签了字）的论点，也就是说，违背了包括伊朗人民党在内的各国共产党和工人党所接受的文件。纲领草案的内容、主要精神和总路线违反许多马克思列宁主义的提法，正是构成修正马克思列宁主义原则的错误观点。
    声明说，在我们看来，南共领导人在资产阶级民族主义倾向的影响下，并且由于不正确地理解和过低估计了无产阶级国际主义，早已转到修正许多马克思列宁主义原则的道路上去了，而这些原则的正确性已经为经验和实践所证实。因此，在南共代表大会上用一切方法来混淆视听的中心问题是无产阶级国际主义。
    声明指出，当前，表明无产阶级国际主义的主要特点是旨在巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家团结一致的行动，旨在巩固和加强以苏联为中心的、领导民主阶层争取和平、民主和社会主义的自觉斗争的一切新型工人政党的团结一致的行动。毫无疑问，凡是真正关心社会主义理想最迅速得到完全胜利的人都明白，在资本主义垄断组织的联合阵线面前的迫切需要和重大的保证，就是全世界工人阶级牢不可破的团结。声明说，以美国帝国主义者为首的帝国主义者今天顽固地企图破坏社会主义阵营的团结。每个革命者都很容易了解，必须反对帝国主义的这种颠覆活动，而南共纲领草案和这个联盟的领导人在代表大会上的发言却绝没有这种明确的方针。
    声明谈到在南共第七次代表大会上提出的纲领草案中，对马克思主义的许多基本原则作了修正。这个纲领草案把国家垄断资本主义说成是社会不可避免地向社会主义过渡的不同形式之一，因而篡改了把资本主义国家看作是资本主义专政的代理人和执行者这样一个重要的马克思列宁主义原则。
    纲领草案认为，国际经济关系，甚至是帝国主义国家间经济关系的发展是世界经济发展的社会主义道路的组成部分，这样就把“世界社会主义经济体系”这个明确概念弄得模糊不清，从而为从这种模糊不清中引起的政治和社会后果准备口实。纲领草案否认了两个敌对阵营——社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营的存在，并把社会主义阵营的概念同“社会主义倾向”和“社会主义力量”这些模糊不清的概念混淆起来。纲领草案不用“两个阵营”——重要的客观真理和现代的主要特征——这个概念，而用“两个集团”这个概念，把两者相提并论，并且自称南斯拉夫站在两个集团之外。否认和平、民主和进步的强大堡垒——社会主义阵营的存在，用两个集团的概念来使这个重大的事实模糊不清，这就是对确定当前形势的一种极其严重的诡辩，是重复那些为资本主义思想家通常所作的分析。
    纲领草案把无产阶级专政看作是“官僚主义的国家极权主义”，并不顾某些正面意见，提出了什么在“工人阶级政权巩固”后国家很快消亡的问题，这样就实际上过低估计只要外来资本主义进攻的危险和国内资本主义复辟的危险还没有消除就必须加强社会主义国家这样重大的任务。纲领草案还低估工人阶级的新型政党无论在准备对社会进行社会主义改造方面或在社会主义建设中的作用。
    声明接着批驳了铁托赞扬“美援”、吹捧美国是制止侵略的“有效因素”的胡说。声明说，现在，美国帝国主义扮演着国际宪兵的角色；它到处帮助奴役者和压迫者来镇压各国人民。绝不能认为这种在分析国际问题的诡辩立场是马克思列宁主义的、革命的立场。
    声明强调说，南共领导人制定这样纲领的目的实际上是要在国际革命工人运动中制造思想混乱，因此，关心团结和马克思列宁主义纯洁的各国共产党和工人党提出批评是必要的。
    伊朗人民党中央委员会认为，马克思列宁主义者取得有国际意义的成就的原因之一，是他们从来不许可在思想问题上有模糊不清和混乱，特别注意自己路线是否明确、是否绝对可靠、是否科学，自己的思想武器是否锋利。
    声明说，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下前进的国际革命运动，如果像南共领导人所说的那样，是依靠一堆死板的、不联系现实生活的教条主义原理，那么决不可能在世界范围取得如此巨大的经济、社会、政治和道义上的成就，也决不可能天天取得新的成就，使国际资本阵线遭到新的失败。总之，在马克思列宁主义的革命创造性同修正马克思主义指导原则的修正主义之间是有明显的区别的。
    声明最后说，纲领草案起草人及其维护者妄自尊大说，他们在同教条主义作斗争。在纲领草案中进行“修正”的那些马克思列宁主义原则是运动的活生生的经验的总结。这些原则的正确性已在人民群众的革命实践中，在强大宏伟的社会主义经济和文化的实际建设的过程中，不止一次地得到了证实。依据已为历史证实是正确的原则，就不是教条主义，而抛弃这些原则的，却正是修正主义。
