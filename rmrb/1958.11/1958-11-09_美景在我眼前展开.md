    Scenery Unfolds Before My Eyes

    My impression of Inner Mongolia used to be that of a desolate and remote region. After reading the reports on the "Inner Mongolia is Covered with Red Flags" special page on the fifth edition of the People's Daily on November 2nd, a beautiful scene immediately unfolded before my eyes. Industry, animal husbandry, agriculture, and cultural and educational undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds. A hundred new factories and mines are added every day. The grain produced in the entire region cannot be consumed in a year. Baotou, one of the three major steel bases of the motherland, is undergoing construction with each passing day. Today, the average grain per person for the Daur people is 2,431 jin... How can all this not be exhilarating? Isn't this painting the newest and most beautiful picture in a place that was once "poor and blank"?

    I hope to often see the new face of the Great Leap Forward in remote areas in the People's Daily.

    美景在我眼前展开
    内蒙古在我的印象中是一个荒凉偏僻的地区。读了人民日报11月2日第五版“内蒙遍地红旗飘”专页上的报道，立刻，一幅美景展开在我的眼前。工业、牧业、农业、文教事业在突飞猛进，新厂矿一天增加一百个，增产的粮食全区一年吃不完，祖国三大钢铁基地之一包头正日新月异进行建设，今日的达斡尔族每人平均粮食二千四百三十一斤……这一切，怎不令人欢欣鼓舞呢？这不正是在“一穷二白”的地方画出了最新最美的图画吗？
    希望经常在人民日报上看到边远地区大跃进的新面貌。
