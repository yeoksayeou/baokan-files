Small Knowledge

    The method of comprehensive coal utilization using indigenous methods is very simple. That is, in the ordinary indigenous coking process, flues are built and connected to the outside of the furnace wall. Three sections of stovepipes for winter heating (mud tiles can also be used) are connected as conduits. Then, prepare two water vats filled with cold water as condensers. After the gas passes through the conduit and is cooled by the first vat, coal tar and a mixed liquid are produced. The upper part of the conduit passing through the second vat is pierced with fine holes. The vat is filled with circulating water mixed with 50% sulfuric acid. The circulating water is pressed into the conduit through the fine holes, and a large amount of ammonia liquor is collected.

    Separating coal tar is also done with indigenous methods. Use a small iron cylinder (capable of holding 70 kilograms of water) as a distillation kettle. After heating, light diesel oil is first separated. The entire comprehensive utilization equipment for each furnace costs no more than 40 yuan, and the entire investment can be recovered after one furnace run.

### 土法炼焦又出油

    土法炼焦又出油
    用土法综合利用煤炭的方法很简单，即在普通的土法炼焦中间，砌出烟道，通到炉壁外边，接上三节冬季取暖用的炉筒子（泥瓦管也可）做导管。再预备两口盛冷水的水缸做为冷凝器。煤气通过导管经这第一口缸冷却后，就产生了煤焦油和混合液。经过第二口缸的导管上部，扎上微细的小孔，缸中盛的是混合50％硫酸的循环水，循环水经细孔压入导管，就收得大量氨水。
    分离煤焦油也是土办法。用一个小铁筒（能装七十公斤水）做蒸馏釜，加热后，轻柴油就先分离出来，每一个炉的全部综合利用设备，最多不过四十元，出一次炉就能把投资全部收回。
