Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 25th November. The National Conference on Worker's Sports, held at the Linxi Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan City, closed on the 24th. The conference proposed that the current worker's sports movement should vigorously promote the Labor and Defense System, so that sports can be closely integrated with production and serve production and construction, as well as national defense construction. On the basis of popularization, the level of sports technology should be improved to actively welcome the upcoming First National Games next year.

According to the reports at the conference, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production over the past year, worker's sports have developed by leaps and bounds. At present, the number of workers nationwide who have passed the Labor and Defense System has increased from more than 77,000 in 1957 to 3.17 million. In addition, more than 1.02 million workers and 1.74 million workers have reached the standards of sports athletes and sports masters, respectively. In Tangshan City, which has more than 140,000 workers, the mass sports movement was vigorously promoted this year, and in just a few months, more than 120,000 workers passed the Labor and Defense System.

The representatives attending the conference exchanged experiences extensively after the reports. The most prominent experience for everyone was that as long as the policy of sports serving production is earnestly implemented, sports activities are closely centered around production, and sports and production are twisted into one rope, it will not only not hinder production, but will greatly promote production. Before August this year, the leading cadres of the Linxi Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine lacked a deep and consistent understanding of the relationship between sports and production. Some people believed that sports could not be vigorously promoted because production was tight, and they did not combine sports with production. Only about 30% of the mine's more than 8,000 workers regularly participated in sports activities, with only 56 workers passing the first level of the Labor and Defense System and 48 workers reaching the level of athletes. In August, the city vigorously promoted the Labor and Defense System movement. The mine conscientiously implemented the policy of sports serving production, closely integrating the development of sports activities with the current production. Miners used the scattered time before and after shifts and before and after meetings to carry out activities such as wrestling and tug-of-war, and a mine-wide sports exercise craze quickly emerged. In just over two months, all the mine's workers, except for the sick, elderly, disabled, and weak, passed the first level of the Labor and Defense System and the standards for athletes; 100% of the mine's key militia reached the second level of the Labor and Defense System, the level of sports referees, and the standard of ordinary shooters. The miners developed a strong interest in physical exercise.

The conference hopes that workers in factories and mining enterprises across the country can basically popularize the Labor and Defense System. Workers who have already passed the first level of the Labor and Defense System should continue to work hard to improve. They must exercise regularly and conscientiously, so that everyone is physically strong and energetic, and makes greater contributions to accelerating socialist construction.

Rong Gaotang, Vice Chairman of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, spoke at the end of the conference.

    把体育和生产拧成一股绳
    全国职工体育工作会议号召大搞劳卫制
    新华社唐山25日电　在唐山市开滦煤矿林西矿召开的全国职工体育工作会议24日闭幕。会议提出当前职工体育运动要大搞劳卫制，使体育紧密地结合生产，为生产建设和国防建设服务。在普及的基础上，提高运动技术水平，积极迎接明年召开的第一届全国运动会。
    根据会议的汇报，一年来随着工农业生产大跃进，职工体育运动有了飞跃的发展。目前，全国通过劳卫制的职工已由1957年的七万七千多人发展到三百一十七万人，还有一百零二万多名职工和一百七十四名职工分别达到了等级运动员和运动健将的标准。拥有十四万多名职工的唐山市，今年大搞群众性体育运动后，短短几个月的时间，通过劳卫制的职工就达到了十二万多人。
    参加会议的代表在汇报后广泛地交流了经验。大家最突出的一个体会是，只要认真贯彻体育为生产服务的方针，紧紧地围绕生产开展体育活动，把体育和生产拧成一根绳，就不仅不会妨碍生产，反而会大大的促进生产。开滦煤矿林西矿在今年8月以前，领导干部对体育和生产之间的关系缺乏深刻的一致的认识，有些人认为生产紧张不能大搞体育，没有把体育和生产结合起来，全矿八千多名职工只有30％左右的人经常参加体育活动，只有五十六名职工通过劳卫制一级，四十八名职工达到等级运动员。8月份，全市大搞劳卫制运动，这个矿认真贯彻了体育为生产服务的方针，把开展体育活动和当前的生产紧密地结合起来进行，矿工们利用班前班后、会前会后的零散时间，进行摔跤、拔河等活动，迅速出现了全矿规模的体育锻炼热潮。仅两个多月的时间，全矿职工除病老残弱外，百分之百通过了劳卫制一级和等级运动员标准；全矿基干民兵，百分之百达到了劳卫制二级、等级裁判员和普通射手标准。矿工们对体育锻炼发生了浓厚的兴趣。
    会议希望全国厂矿企业的职工都能做到基本上普及劳卫制。已经通过劳卫制一级的职工，要努力继续提高。要经常锻炼、认真锻炼，做到人人身体强健，个个精神旺盛，为加速社会主义建设做出更大的贡献。
    国家体委副主任荣高棠曾在会议结束时讲了话。
