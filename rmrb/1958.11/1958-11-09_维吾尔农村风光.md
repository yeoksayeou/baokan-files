Uyghur Rural Scenery
By Our Reporter Yang Ke Xian

    After arriving at the Wuxing People's Commune in Turpan County, we stayed at the Sixth Brigade. It was during the most intense period of the commune's farmers' campaign for steel production and the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, planting and plowing). On October 6th, the Sixth Brigade had dispatched 37% of its labor force, mainly young and middle-aged men, to the remote mountains over a hundred kilometers away to make steel. After this, the brigade was left with only ninety-six male laborers and two hundred and seventy-two female laborers.

    The steel campaign drained the agricultural front of its best workers, while the agricultural production tasks were heavier than any previous year. This year's cotton yield of over two thousand three hundred mu increased by a factor of two compared to last year, with an expected yield of over one million five hundred and sixty thousand jin of seed cotton. From cotton picking to transporting cotton, the labor force required was double that of last year. To ensure an even greater leap forward in agriculture next year, it's necessary to deeply plow more than three thousand mu of land now, modify deep plows and rope-drawn deep plowing equipment. Winter wheat sowing work is not yet completed, and with the frost season approaching, an additional task of burying over eleven thousand grapevines to protect them for the winter has been added. In short, agricultural tasks are pressing, and double the labor force is needed.

    This situation once sparked a major debate: steel or agriculture? Or both? The conclusion was that we need both steel and agriculture. Taking the Wuxing People's Commune as an example, next year it will need ten tractors and ten trucks, one hundred rubber-wheeled carts, and many small generators – none of which can be made without steel production. So, what to do about the labor shortage on the agricultural front? The result of the debate was the establishment of the "Five Same Red and Expert Brigade."

          Five Same Red and Expert Brigade

    The Uyghur farmers of Turpan used to live very scattered. The Sixth Brigade's three hundred-plus households were spread over more than ten square kilometers of land, making it very inconvenient for farmers to work together. During the period of intensive labor, they proposed the "Five Same Red and Expert Brigade" organization, where they would eat, live, labor, study, and entertain together. Once this was proposed, the commune members all supported it enthusiastically. The Red and Expert Brigade was originally planned for only a hundred or so people, but nearly double that number signed up.

    We visited the brigade's six detachments: autumn sowing and deep plowing, transportation, infrastructure construction, processing of sideline occupations, grape burying, and women's detachment, and found a dramatic increase in labor efficiency. In the past, Uyghur farmers plowed the land with one person leading the horse and one person holding the plow. This time, we came to the deep plowing fields and saw twenty-four horses pulling twelve large plows, each plow requiring only one person, thus doubling the work efficiency. In the past, transportation forces were scattered across fourteen production teams, making dispatching very inflexible. Now, they are concentrated together, transporting cotton, melons, and sorghum separately. They shuttle back and forth on the roads in the fields, and within five days, they transported the eleven thousand jin of cotton that had been stockpiled in the production teams to the processing plant, ensuring that the daily transportation tasks of autumn sorghum harvesting, cotton picking, and melon picking were completed on the same day.

    We also saw that Uyghur women, who used to only participate in supplementary labor, have now become the main force on the agricultural front. Out of the brigade's two hundred and seventy-two women, apart from a small number serving as cooks, nannies, and tailors for the production teams, all of them are working every day, picking more than ten thousand jin of cotton a day.

    The Red and Expert Brigade approved the establishment of a women's detachment composed of thirty-two young women without children. They undertook the work of cutting sorghum, transportation, and burying grapevines, which had been considered tasks only men could do in the past. We participated in the women's detachment's autumn sorghum harvest. The sorghum field was a sea of songs. Abu Du Re Zake, the Party branch secretary, excitedly told us that the women's sorghum cutting speed was not inferior to that of the men. On the first day, more than twenty people cut fifty mu of sorghum during the day, and picked cotton on six mu of land at night, carrying lanterns.

    Many women also challenged their husbands to competitions. We asked Sa A Da Ti Han, an eighteen-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, what kind of competition conditions she had with her lover. She shyly said that they would not meet at home until the autumn harvest was complete, and both would strive to become model members of the Communist Youth League.

      Passing By the Door Five Times Without Entering

    After walking through the picturesque cotton fields and melon fields, we came to a vineyard covering nearly one hundred mu. We saw people all over the vineyard swinging hoes to dig soil and bury grapevines. There was an over forty-year-old Sai Yi Ti, with a thick beard on his cheeks. When he swung the hoe, an entire chunk of soil flew towards the grapevine. One strike after another, the strength was used very evenly.

    Seeing us arrive, Sai Yi Ti explained with a smile: "It was agreed at the meeting late last night that the photojournalist would take a picture of the grape-burying team going to work this morning. But those young people in the grape detachment, before the wake-up bell rang, secretly pushed me, I secretly called you, and went to the field in the dark. When the photojournalist arrived with the flash when the bell rang, it was still not bright, and only the six of us old people were left standing in line."

    Sai Yi Ti's four-person grape group is made up of older poor peasants, who are currently competing with the young grape group leader. His wife, Nu La Han, stands at the door to greet him every evening, telling him to come home after work to see the newborn grandson of their daughter. But Sai Yi Ti always waves his hand and says with a smile as he passes by the door on his way home from work every day: "No, my dear, we haven't finished burying the grapes yet." They work from before sunrise until the moon rises every day, and discuss how to work the next day while they sleep. The speed of burying grapes is getting faster every day, with work efficiency doubling compared to last year.

    Unexpectedly, the young people left them behind and went to the vineyard early this day. So they rushed to the field and began to bury grapevines without saying a word. These grapevines are large clumps, with tendrils crawling along the ground for two or three zhang, connected and intertwined. Now they are tearing them apart one by one, coiling them together like hair, with the old vines on the outside and the new shoots on the inside, pressing them together with soil. While Sai Yi Ti was coiling the grapes, his arm was cut and bleeding by a dead branch, but he still kept busy without saying a word.

    "Sai Yi Ti 'Aka' (Brother), take a break and talk for a while!" "Sai Yi Ti Aka, why aren't you smoking your pipe today?" the young people asked him with concern. But he said, "Young men, work fast! The light frost has already withered the tender grape leaves."

    In fact, everyone was working non-stop. They even ate their breakfast and lunch of roasted nang, tea, and sweet melons in the vineyard. They have recently coiled more than four thousand grapevines, and with another four or five days of intensive work, they can coil all the more than eleven thousand grapevines. One young man told us that today's Uyghur farmers are not old, and can catch up with young people in half a day.

      White-Haired Old Man Reads Books

    On the eve of leaving the Sixth Brigade, we came across two amateur cultural classes of the Red and Expert Brigade studying. One was a mixed cultural class for the third and fourth grades, located in the cafeteria next to the Happiness Home; the other was a literacy class for illiterates and semi-literates, located in the dormitory of the autumn sowing and deep plowing detachment. Cultural studies are held in the evenings, with one evening every two nights dedicated to intensive labor and one evening dedicated to intensive cultural studies.

    We entered the literacy class for illiterates and semi-literates, where A Le Tong Na, a female teacher from the commune's primary school, was teaching. The classroom was crowded with more than sixty male and female Uyghur farmers, who were sitting on the floor, holding pencils, exercise books, and textbooks, reading aloud. A Le Tong Na carefully helped them distinguish the shapes and sounds of the Uyghur alphabet, fearing that everyone would not remember them accurately. She read them over and over again, and wrote many common single words composed of these letters on the blackboard.

    More than sixty male and female farmers all wanted to learn culture well. Among them sat an elderly Uyghur Sai Mai Ti with white hair and a long beard. I saw Sai Mai Ti laboriously bending down and drawing the five letters on the ground five times, and then asking the person next to him to correct them. When the young female teacher called his name to read the sounds, he began to feel a little embarrassed, then wiped his face with his hand, as if he had made up his mind. But he pleaded that he was old and it was inconvenient to stand up. So he sat on the ground and read the sounds of "bai," "pai," "tai," "nai," and "ye."

    "I am almost seventy years old," Sai Mai Ti told me. "For the past fifty years, I herded sheep, did odd jobs, and wandered around, without getting the opportunity to study. After liberation, I felt that I was too old and had a bad memory, so I didn't seize the opportunity to study. The people's commune has been established, and it looks like a socialist society is about to be built, and a communist society is coming soon. How can I go to such a good society without culture?" To help with memorization, Sai Mai Ti said that tomorrow, when he goes to the field, he will write the newly learned letters on the handle of the hoe with a pencil, and memorize them while working.

    维吾尔农村风光
    本报记者　杨克现
    到达吐鲁番县五星人民公社后，我们住在第六大队。这当儿，正是公社农民突击钢铁、突击三秋的最紧张的关头。10月6日，第六队曾经抽调了37％的主要是青壮年的劳动力，奔赴一百多公里外过去荒无人烟的深山炼铁。从这以后，这个队仅剩下了九十六个男劳动力和二百七十二个妇女劳动力。
    炼铁抽去了农业战线上的精华，农业生产任务又比那一年都要繁重。今年的二千三百多亩棉花单产比去年增加一倍，可收籽棉一百五十六万多斤，从拾棉到运棉都要比去年增加双倍的劳动力。为了明年农业更大的跃进，从现在起就需要深翻三千多亩土地，需要改装深翻犁和绳索牵引深耕犁，冬麦播种工作尚未完成，眼看霜期降临，又增加了一万一千多墩葡萄埋土过冬的任务。总之，农业任务很紧，都需要双倍劳动力。
    这种情况曾经引起要钢铁还是要农业？还是两者都要的大辩论。结论是要钢铁也要农业。以五星人民公社而论，明年就需要十部拖拉机和十部汽车，一百辆胶轮车和许多小型发电机，那一样也离不开钢铁生产。那么农业战线上人力不足怎么办？辩论的结果成立了五同红专连的组织。
          五同红专连
    吐鲁番维吾尔族农民，原来居住的都非常分散。第六大队三百多户农民分散在十多平方公里的土地上，农民要一起上工非常不便。在突击劳动的时期内，他们提出同吃，同住，同劳动，同学习和同娱乐的五同红专连的组织一经提出，社员都纷纷拥护。本来只计划百十来个人的红专连组织，报名的却多出将近一倍。
    我们参观了红专连的秋种深翻、运输、基建、加工副业、埋葡萄和妇女等六个排，发现劳动效率有了惊人的提高。过去维吾尔族农民犁地，总是一人牵马一人扶犁，这回我们来到了深耕地里，看见二十四匹马拉着十二张大犁，每张犁只要一人，这样就把工效提高一倍。过去运输力量分散在十四个生产小队，调度很不灵活，现在他们集中一起，分别运棉花，运瓜和运输高粱。他们在田野间的大道上穿梭如飞，五天之内，就把过去积压在各生产队的十一万斤棉花运到了加工厂，而且保证了每天秋收高粱、拾棉花、摘瓜的运输任务当天完成。
    我们在这里还看到，过去只参加附带劳动的维吾尔族妇女，今天已变成农业战线上的主力军。全队二百七十二个妇女，除了少部分担任了生产队的炊事员、保姆和裁缝外，每天全部出勤，一天拾棉花一万多斤。
    红专连批准了三十二个没有孩子拖累的青年妇女成立了妇女排，她们担负了过去被认为是男子才能干的割高粱、搞运输和埋葡萄的工作。我们参加了妇女排的秋收高粱工作，高粱地里是一片歌声的海洋。党的支部书记阿不都热扎克兴奋地告诉我们说，妇女割高粱的速度不亚于男子，第一天二十多个人在白天割了五十亩高粱，晚间提着马灯还拾了六亩地的棉花。
    许多妇女还和她的丈夫挑战比赛。我们问一个十八岁的共青团员萨阿达提罕和她的爱人有些什么竞赛条件。她羞答答地说，秋收不完，不在家中见面，两个人都争取当上模范共青团员。
      五过其门而不入
    走过了风景如画的棉田和瓜田，我们来到了一个占地将近一百亩的葡萄园。只见人们满园抡起砍土镘挖土埋葡萄藤。有个四十多岁满腮浓密胡须的色意提，他一抡起砍土镘，一整块土就飞向葡萄藤。一下又一下，力气使用得非常均匀。
    看见我们来了，色意提笑容可掬地解释说：“昨天深夜开会本来说好了的，今晨摄影记者要拍一张葡萄排列队上工的照片。可是葡萄排那些年轻人，还没有打起床钟，就你悄悄推我，我悄悄叫你，摸黑上了地。摄影记者打钟时拿着闪光灯赶来，这时天还没明，就只剩下我们六个年纪大的人站着队。”
    色意提这个四人葡萄小组都是年纪比较大的老贫农，这几天正在和年轻的葡萄小组长比赛。他的妻子努拉罕每天黄昏站在门口迎接他，说是叫他下工后回家看看姑娘新生下的外孙。可是色意提每天下工路过门口，总是摆摆手笑着说：“不行，我亲爱的，我们埋葡萄的任务还没有完成。”他们每天早晨顶上星星干，夜晚顶上月亮干，睡觉时还讨论第二天怎么干。埋葡萄的速度一天比一天快，比去年的工效提高一倍。
    想不到这一天年轻人把他们撇下提早上了葡萄园。于是他们赶到地里一言不发就埋起葡萄藤来。这葡萄藤都是一簇簇大的墩子，藤蔓顺地爬了两三丈远，瓜葛相连，纠缠在一起。现在把它一根根撕开，像盘头发一样，盘在一起，让老藤在外，嫩枝朝里，用土压在一起。色意提盘葡萄的当儿，手臂被枯枝划破出血了，但还是不啃声忙个不停。
    “色意提‘阿卡’（哥），休息下来谈一会儿吧！”“色意提阿卡，今天你怎么不抽旱烟了？”年轻的人关怀地问候他。可是他说：“小伙子，快干吧！轻霜已经把葡萄嫩叶打枯了。”
    其实所有的人都没有停，他们连早饭、午饭都是带着烤馕、茶和甜瓜在葡萄园子吃。他们最近已盘完了四千多墩葡萄，再突击四、五天就可以盘完全部一万一千多墩葡萄。这一天，色意提小组工效提高得更快，一个上午就盘完了三十五墩葡萄。有个青年向我们说，如今维吾尔农民老人不老，半天之内就赶上了年轻的人。
      白发老人把书念
    告别第六大队的前夕，我们正碰上了红专连的两个业余文化班在学习。一个是三四年级的混合文化班，设在幸福院隔壁的食堂里；一个文盲和半文盲的识字班，设在秋种深耕排的宿舍里。文化学习都在晚间，每两个晚上，有一晚突击劳动，有一晚突击文化学习。
    我们走进文盲和半文盲的识字班，公社小学女教师阿勒统娜正在上课。教室挤满了六十多个男女维吾尔族农民，他们席地而坐，拿着铅笔、练习簿和课本，朗朗读书。阿勒统娜细心地帮助他们辨别维吾尔文字母的字形和字音，唯恐大家记不准，她念了一遍又一遍，并且在黑板上写下了许多由这些字母组成的常用单字。
    六十多个男女农民都一心想把文化学好，他们中间坐着一位白发长须的维吾尔族老赛买提。我看见赛买提吃力地弯下身子把五个字母在地上划了五遍，然后又请旁边的人校正。等到年轻的女教师喊名读音时，他开始感到有些窘，接着用手抹了一下脸，像是下定了决心。不过他申诉说自己年老了，起立不方便。他就坐在地上读出了“摆”，“派”、“太”、“乃”和“也”的字音。
    “我是快七十的人了。”赛买提向我说道：“过去的五十多年，放羊，打短工，到处流浪，得不到学习的机会。解放后这几年又觉得岁数大了，记性不好，没有抓紧学习。人民公社成立了，眼看社会主义社会快建成了，共产主义社会也就快要来了，没有文化怎么能够到那样好的社会。”为了帮助记忆，赛买提表示明天上地，就把新学的字母用铅笔写在砍土镘把上，一边劳动，一边记忆。（附图片）“亲爱的，我们埋葡萄的任务还没有完成。”
