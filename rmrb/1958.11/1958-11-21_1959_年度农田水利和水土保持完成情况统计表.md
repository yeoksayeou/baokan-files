    1959 Annual Statistics on Farmland Irrigation and Water and Soil Conservation

    Editor's Note: This winter and next spring will be a crucial year for our country to strive for the basic realization of water conservancy. The scale of farmland irrigation and water and soil conservation campaigns will be even larger than last winter and this spring, and the requirements will be even higher. Currently, a high tide of winter water conservancy construction is gradually forming in various regions. In order to promote the overall upsurge of the water conservancy movement, this newspaper will regularly publish the progress of farmland irrigation and water and soil conservation in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions.

    Since the farmland irrigation year is calculated from October 1st to September 30th of the following year, the figures published in this issue are calculated from October 1st. (Attached charts)

    编者注：今冬明春为我国争取基本实现水利化关键性的一年。兴修水利和水土保持运动的规模将比去冬今春更大，要求也更高。当前各地水利冬修高潮正在逐步形成，为了推动水利运动的全面高涨，本报将定期公布各省、市、自治区农田水利和水土保持进度情况。
    由于农田水利年度是由10月1日到次年9月30日计算的，本期所公布的数字是从10月1日算起的。（附图表）
