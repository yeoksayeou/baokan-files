Every Grain is Hard-Earned, Not a Single One to be Lost
Shanxi Launches "Second Autumn Harvest" Campaign to Recover Large Quantities of Grain
Hebei Vigorously Rushes to Harvest Sweet Potatoes, Reviewing Fields to Ensure a Bumper Harvest

This newspaper Taiyuan 5th dispatch: The "Second Autumn Harvest Campaign" launched by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to ensure a bumper agricultural harvest has been widely carried out throughout the province and has achieved unexpected success. The situation in various regions proves that the "Second Autumn Harvest Campaign" is an effective remedy for the rough harvesting phenomenon under the current busy work conditions.

As early as mid-October, the Shanxi Provincial, Special District, and County Autumn Harvest Inspection Teams discovered that, due to some cadres' thinking that "with many tasks and few people, rough harvesting and threshing are inevitable" and the excessive busyness of continuous night harvesting, rough harvesting was widespread. According to surveys and calculations, in some seriously affected areas, the losses were as high as: 300 jin of potatoes lost per mu, 100 jin of millet lost per mu, and 50 jin of corn lost per mu. The collection of potatoes was even more careless, with them being randomly placed in fields and roadsides, leading to spoilage. In response to this situation, the Shanxi Provincial Committee immediately issued a call to organize elderly, women, and children's grain-gathering teams to conduct a second autumn harvest. The Yuci, Changzhi, Jinan, and Yanbei Prefectural Committees held telephone conferences to convey and deploy the call. As a result, more than one million elderly and children's grain-gathering teams were quickly formed throughout the province. Yanbei, Xin County, and other areas quickly gathered over 120 million jin of grain. In the Jinzhong area, Zhongyang and other four counties mobilized 58,000 people every day, checking every plot and picking every ear, with each person able to pick more than ten jin of grain per day. Before the second autumn harvest, Huguan, Pingshun, Zuoquan, and other counties also launched mass criticism and debate, refuting the inevitable theory of "many tasks and few people, rough harvesting and threshing" and the indifferent thinking, establishing the concept of cherishing grain, and supervising each other during the autumn harvest, changing the harvesting from rough to meticulous, resulting in fast and good harvesting.

In carrying out the second autumn harvest campaign, the vast number of rural cadres also learned a new set of leadership methods, which is to rationally use labor and give full play to everyone's unique role in doing a good job in autumn harvesting. Rural cadres in the Yuci area discovered that the main reason for rough harvesting was the lack of labor, so they organized a large number of laborers to carry out a five-day blitz, concentrating on completing the heavy work, and then mobilized women and children to clean up. This made the autumn harvest fast and good, with clean fields, clean roads, clean threshing grounds, and every grain returned to the granary. Zuo Yun County initially used only strong laborers to dig potatoes, which was fast but also resulted in many losses. After the county committee discovered this situation, it immediately divided the county's 40,000-strong autumn harvest army into rows and groups, with strong laborers collecting the first round and weak laborers collecting the second round. During autumn plowing, a child followed each plow to pick up potatoes. Within three days, a total of more than 660,000 jin were picked up.

According to the Hebei Daily, a large-scale sweet potato rescue campaign is underway in various parts of Hebei Province.

This year, Hebei Province has planted a total of more than 24 million mu of sweet potatoes. According to statistics at the end of October, 19 million mu have been dug up, and more than 5 million mu have not yet been dug up. Many places have experienced serious losses during harvesting. Only a small portion of the harvested sweet potatoes have been stored in cellars or sliced, and most are still piled in the fields, threshing grounds, and courtyards without processing. It is understood that some of those already stored in cellars have also become moldy due to inadequate pre-inspection.

In order to reverse this situation in a timely manner, all localities have conducted extensive airing of views, big debates, and thoroughly refuted various erroneous arguments such as "insufficient labor to complete the potato-digging task." The Baoding Special District, through mass airing of views and debates, quickly mobilized 1.5 million people to participate in the rush to harvest autumn grains, mainly sweet potatoes, digging more than 300,000 mu of sweet potatoes per day. Tang County's potato-digging progress was originally very slow. After organizing a conference and debate among more than 2,400 county and township cadres, the daily digging increased from more than 20,000 mu to more than 50,000 mu the next day. After the debate in Xushui County, the task of digging 380,000 mu of potatoes was completed in five days.

Regarding the phenomenon of careless harvesting and serious losses, many places conducted on-site inspections, using accounting and debate methods to criticize the erroneous thinking that "losing a few pieces doesn't matter." After inspecting the harvested sweet potatoes in Luozhuang, Hongqi Township, Ningjin County, it was found that an average of 450 jin was lost per mu. Through the inspection of seven mu of land in Renyi Sheng Village, Hongxing Township, it was found that 2,280 jin of sweet potato pieces were lost in two mu. In this way, if all 357,000 mu of sweet potatoes in the county are calculated at an average loss of 100 jin per mu, a total of 35.7 million jin would be lost, equivalent to more than 8.9 million jin of grain, enough for 22,300 people to eat for a year. This startled the vast number of commune members, who expressed their determination to harvest meticulously and bring every piece home. All localities have mobilized the masses to launch autumn harvest re-inspection, picking up large quantities of discarded sweet potatoes. In the field-by-field re-inspection movement in Zunhua County in late October, with the participation of 120,000 people, 748,000 jin of sweet potatoes and other grains were recovered in just five days. The Qianjin People's Commune in the county mobilized 10,000 people to pick up more than 1.23 million jin of lost sweet potatoes in one day.

    粒粒皆辛苦　一颗也不丢
    山西发动“第二次秋收”运动夺回大量粮食
    河北大力抢收甘薯逐地复查保证丰产丰收
    本报太原5日电　中共山西省委发动的保证农业丰产丰收的“第二次秋收运动”，已经在全省广泛开展起来，并且获得了意料之外的成就。各地的情况证明：“第二次秋收运动”是在当前工作繁忙的情况下，对秋收粗糙现象的一个有效的补救办法。
    早在10月中旬，山西省、专、县秋收检查团发现，由于某些干部有“活多人少，粗收粗打难免”的思想和连夜抢收过于繁忙等原因，秋收中粗糙现象很普遍。据调查计算，个别严重地区，竟然达到：山药蛋每亩丢三百斤，谷子每亩丢一百斤，玉米每亩丢五十斤。山药蛋的收藏更为马虎，随便放在地头路边，造成了腐烂的情况。针对这种情况，山西省委当即发出组织老年和妇女、儿童拾粮队，进行第二次秋收的号召。榆次、长治、晋南、雁北等地委分别召开了电话会议，进行了传达和布置。这样，全省很快就组成一百多万老年、小孩拾粮队。雁北、忻县等地区很快拾粮一亿二千多万斤。晋中地区中阳等四县每天出动五万八千多人，块块查、穗穗拾，每人每天能拾十多斤粮食。壶关、平顺、左权等县在第二次秋收以前，还开展了鸣放辩论，驳倒了活多人少、粗收粗打的难免论和满不在乎的思想，人人树立爱护粮食的观点，秋收中互相监督，收割由粗糙变细致，收得又快又好。
    在开展第二次秋收运动中，广大农村干部还学会一套新的领导方法，就是合理使用劳动力，发挥每个人的独特作用，把秋收工作做好。榆次地区农村干部发现秋收粗糙的原因主要是劳力弱，便组织大批劳力，进行五天突击，集中干完重活，然后发动妇女儿童扫尾。这样就使秋收又快又好，到处是地净、路净、场净、颗粒还仓。左云县开始单用强劳力刨山药蛋，收得虽然很快，但丢的也不少。县委发现这一情况后，立即把全县四万秋收大军，分排编组，强劳力收头遍，弱劳力收第二遍，秋耕时，每张犁后边跟上一个小孩拾山药蛋，三天之内共拾回六十六万多斤。
    据河北日报消息：河北省各地正掀起一个大规模的抢救甘薯运动。
    河北全省今年共种甘薯二千四百多万亩，到10月底统计，已经刨了的有一千九百万亩，还有五百多万亩没有刨。许多地方在收刨中丢失很严重。已经收刨的也只有少部分入了窖或切了片，大部分还堆在地里、场里、院里没有处理；已经入窖的，据了解也有因事先检查不严而发生霉坏的。
    各地为了及时扭转这种情况，都通过大鸣大放大辩论，大破“劳力不足无法完成刨薯任务”等各种错误论调。保定专区通过群众的鸣放辩论，短时期内即发动一百五十万人投入抢收秋粮主要是甘薯的运动，日刨甘薯三十多万亩。唐县原来刨薯的进度很慢，经组织二千四百多县、乡干部的大会辩论后，第二天就由日刨二万多亩增加到五万多亩。徐水县经过辩论后，五天就完成了三十八万亩的刨薯任务。
    对于收刨不细、丢失严重的现象，许多地方都实地检查，采用算细账和辩论的办法，批判了认为“丢几块算不了什么”的错误思想。宁津县红旗乡罗庄经检查收刨后的甘薯，一般每亩丢了四百五十斤。红星乡仁义生村通过对七亩地的检查，其中有二亩丢薯块二千二百八十斤。这样，全县三十五万七千亩甘薯，如果按每亩平均丢一百斤计算，共丢三千五百七十万斤，折粮八百九十多万斤，足够二万二千三百人吃一年。这一下使广大社员吃了一惊，纷纷表示要精收细刨，作到块块还家。各地都发动了广大群众，掀起了秋收复查，拣回了大批被丢掉的甘薯。遵化县在10月下旬，有十二万人参加的逐地复查运动中，仅五天的时间，就拾回甘薯等折合粮食七十四万八千多斤，这个县的前进人民公社，动员了一万人在一天中就拣回丢失的甘薯一百二十三万多斤。
