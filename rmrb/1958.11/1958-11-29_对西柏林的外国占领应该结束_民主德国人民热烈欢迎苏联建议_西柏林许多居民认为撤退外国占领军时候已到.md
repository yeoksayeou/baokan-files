    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 28th. The people of the German Democratic Republic warmly welcome the Soviet government's proposal to transform West Berlin into a demilitarized free city.
    All newspapers in Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, today published on full pages the Soviet government's note to the German Democratic Republic government on the Berlin issue and the full text of Khrushchev's remarks at the Moscow press conference on the 27th. "Neues Deutschland" wrote in a banner headline: "The Soviet proposal is to consolidate peace and the national interests of the German people; the unreasonable foreign occupation system in West Berlin should end, the original capital of Germany should belong to the German people, and West Berlin must not be used as a breeding ground for international tension and war again." The headline of "Berliner Zeitung" said that the Soviet government's note is the way to solve the Berlin issue. The headline of "Tribüne" wrote that the Soviet note is an important step towards normalizing the situation in Berlin and Germany.
    At noon on the 27th, the people of the German Democratic Republic listened with great concern to the news broadcast by local radio stations about the Soviet government's proposal. Berlin newspapers also issued special editions to allow residents to understand the full content of the proposal. In many factories, workers held their own meetings for discussion and enthusiastically supported the Soviet proposal. Many residents and groups also sent telegrams to the German Democratic Republic government, expressing welcome and support for the Soviet government's proposal.
    Many residents of West Berlin have adopted a welcoming attitude towards the Soviet government's proposal. According to a report in "Neues Deutschland", many shop owners and bank managers in West Berlin spoke to the newspaper's reporters with great interest and optimism about the Soviet proposal. A bookstore owner said: "Now is the time to withdraw all occupying forces and allow Berlin to regain a normal life." An engineer at Siemens said: "Anyone who wants peace and a normal environment cannot refuse the Soviet proposal." Professor Leif, chairman of the Free German Youth in West Berlin, said that it would be most foolish to take a dismissive attitude towards the Soviet note. (Attached picture)

    新华社柏林28日电　民主德国人民热烈欢迎苏联政府关于把西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市的建议。
    民主德国首都柏林的所有报纸今天都以整版篇幅刊登了苏联政府就柏林问题给民主德国政府的照会和赫鲁晓夫27日在莫斯科记者招待会上的谈话全文。“新德意志报”在通栏标题中写道：“苏联的建议，是为了巩固和平和德国人民的民族利益；对西柏林的不合理的外国占领制度应该结束，德国原来的首都应属于德国人民，不许把西柏林再做为国际紧张局势和战争的策源地”。“柏林日报”的标题说，苏联政府的照会是解决柏林问题的道路。“论坛报”的标题写道，“苏联的照会是使柏林和德国局势正常化的重要步骤”。
    27日中午，民主德国人民就以极大的关怀收听了此间各广播电台广播的关于苏联政府建议的消息。柏林各报还发行了号外，使居民了解这个建议的全部内容。在许多工厂中，工人们自行集会进行讨论，并且热烈支持苏联的建议。许多居民和团体还打电报给民主德国政府，表示欢迎和支持苏联政府的建议。
    西柏林许多居民都对苏联政府的建议采取欢迎的态度。据“新德意志报”报道，西柏林许多商店老板、银行经理在同这家报纸的记者谈话时，都以极大的兴趣和乐观态度谈到了苏联的建议。一家书店的老板说：“现在应该是撤退所有占领军并且使柏林重新获得正常生活的时候了”。西门子公司的一位工程师说：“所有要求和平和正常环境的人，都不能对苏联的建议采取拒绝的态度”。自由德意志党西柏林市主席普罗夫·累伊夫说，对苏联照会采取不考虑的态度是最愚蠢不过的事。（附图片）
