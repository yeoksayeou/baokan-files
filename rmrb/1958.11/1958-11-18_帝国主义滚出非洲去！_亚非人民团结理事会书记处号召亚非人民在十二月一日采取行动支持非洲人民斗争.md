    Imperialism, Get Out of Africa!
    Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council Calls on Asian and African Peoples to Take Action on December 1st to Support the African People's Struggle

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 16th - The Permanent Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council today called on the peoples of Asian and African countries to jointly demand on December 1st that the imperialists get out of Africa.

    The Secretariat's statement issued here today regarding the "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" to be held on December 1st stated that the Secretariat believes that "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" will become a "final notice to tell the imperialists to get out immediately."

    The statement said that now that Africans have begun to stand up, imperialism has adopted deceptive and conspiratorial methods such as de Gaulle's "referendum" or the British-manipulated "elections" in Uganda, in an attempt to salvage their inevitable doom. At the same time, they have adopted ruthless suppression and terror.

    The statement also said that the imperialists shamelessly say that they are fulfilling a "civilizing mission" in Africa. But the peoples of African countries have learned from their painful experience what this "civilizing mission" is. They know that this "civilizing mission" is shameful and hypocritical. Through their daily battles for freedom, they are demanding that the imperialists get out of Africa immediately.

    The statement said that the broad and profound movement to get imperialism out of Africa, vigorously promoted by the Bandung Conference, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, and the Accra Conference, has now become the most obvious characteristic of the African continent. The peoples of African countries are moving forward to regain their legitimate place in the family of the world's free and peaceful peoples. Their unanimous demand to imperialism is: Get out of Africa!

    The statement called on the peoples of Asian countries to support the struggle of their African brothers to get imperialism out of Africa. It also called on national Asian-African solidarity committees to organize marches, mass rallies, and demonstrations to make December 1st a day of expression of the unified will of all freedom-loving people.

    This newspaper reports: Ray Vicker, a reporter for the American "Wall Street Journal," recently admitted that the rapid development of the African national independence movement has created "new problems for the United States." He said that the birth of more and more new independent countries may "endanger American private capital in Africa." The United States and two other countries have massively plundered valuable products such as gold, diamonds, uranium, cocoa, aluminum, chromium, cobalt, antimony, and tin from the African continent. Therefore, "if the Western world loses this place, it will be a major political and economic failure." The United States and other Western countries are facing a "fierce and costly battle."

    Ray Vicker advocated using American "aid" to win over newly independent African countries. He said that these countries lack funds and technicians, and have few literate people. On the other hand, their desire for freedom is very strong, "even willing to exchange favorable conditions for the right to be their own masters." The United States can use this to further expand its colonial power in Africa and undermine the African national independence movement.

    帝国主义滚出非洲去！
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处号召亚非人民在十二月一日采取行动支持非洲人民斗争
    新华社开罗16日电　亚非人民团结理事会常设书记处今天号召亚非各国人民在12月1日共同要求帝国主义者从非洲滚出去。
    书记处今天在这里发表的关于将在12月1日举行“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的声明中说，书记处相信，“帝国主义滚出非洲日”将成为“叫帝国主义者立即滚出去的最后通知”。
    声明说，现在非洲人已经开始站起来了，因此帝国主义就采取像戴高乐所玩弄的“公民投票”或者像英国所操纵的乌干达的“选举”等欺骗和阴谋手段，来企图挽救他们不可避免的灭亡的命运。同时，他们采取了残酷到无以复加的镇压和恐怖手段。
    声明又说，帝国主义者厚颜无耻地说，他们是在非洲实现“教化的使命”。可是非洲各国人民已经从他们痛苦的经验中知道了这种“教化的使命”是什么东西。他们知道，这个“教化的使命”是可耻的和伪善的。他们通过他们每天所进行的争取自由的战斗，表示要求帝国主义者立即从非洲滚出去。
    声明说，广泛而深刻的要帝国主义滚出非洲的运动，在万隆会议、亚非人民团结大会和阿克拉会议的有力推动下，现在已经成为非洲大陆的最明显的特点。非洲各国人民正在向前迈进，以争取重新获得他们在世界自由和和平人民的大家庭中的合法地位。他们对帝国主义一致提出的要求是：从非洲滚出去！
    声明号召亚洲各国人民声援非洲弟兄们所进行的要帝国主义滚出非洲的斗争。它还号召各国亚非团结委员会组织游行、群众集会和示威等，使12月1日这一天成为一切爱好自由人民的统一意志的表示。
    本报讯　美国“华尔街日报”记者雷·维克不久以前承认，非洲民族独立运动的迅速发展，“美国面前已出现了新的问题”。他说，越来越多的新的独立国家的诞生，已经可能“危及美国在非洲的私人资本”。美国和其他两个国家大规模地掠夺了非洲大陆的金、钻石、铀、可可、铝、铬、钴、锑、锡等贵重产品，因此，“如果西方世界失去这个地方的话，这将是政治上和经济上的重大失败”。美国和其他西方国家正面临着一场“激烈的和耗费巨大的战斗”。
    雷·维克主张用美“援”拉拢独立不久的非洲国家。他说，这些国家缺乏资金和技术人员，而且识字的人也不多，另一方面，他们要求自由的愿望却十分强烈，“甚至愿意以有利的条件来换取当家作主的权利”。美国可以利用这一点来进一步扩大它在非洲的殖民势力，破坏非洲的民族独立运动。
