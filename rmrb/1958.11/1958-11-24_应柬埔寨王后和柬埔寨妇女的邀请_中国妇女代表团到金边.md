Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 23rd: At the invitation of the Queen of Cambodia and Cambodian women, the Chinese women's delegation led by Zhang Qian arrived in Phnom Penh by plane this morning.

Prince Sihanouk and Princess Rasmi were at the airport to welcome them, and accompanied the head of the Chinese women's delegation in reviewing the guard of honor composed of female members of the Cambodian Royal Socialist Youth League.

Madam Fang Bingzhen, Chairman of the Reception Committee, delivered a speech, welcoming the distinguished Chinese guests on behalf of the King and Queen of Cambodia, the government, and the people. She said: "It is a great pleasure for the Cambodian people to receive representatives of a great power that is friendly and just to Cambodia, because this country is a symbol of labor and progressive forces."

She said: "The Cambodian people firmly believe that your arrival will help to further strengthen the friendship between Cambodian and Chinese women and the sincere relations between our two countries."

She expressed gratitude for China's valuable assistance. She said, "The great Chinese nation expressed very precious support and a sense of justice at a time when serious border incidents were deliberately created in our neighboring country. At that time, China's deep sympathy was a great encouragement to us."

Madam Fang Bingzhen praised China's construction achievements. She also said that Chinese women, who were in dire circumstances not long ago, have already demonstrated their abilities, loyalty, and character in the struggle for liberation. Today, they fully participate in national construction and are on an equal footing with men. Their strength, courage, and will have moved all those who have visited China.

Head of the Delegation Zhang Qian said in reply: "The Chinese people highly value the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people. Chinese women are very willing to contribute to enhancing this friendship. We have long looked forward to meeting our Cambodian sisters, establishing close ties, and working together to build our respective prosperous and strong motherlands, and to defend peace in Asia and the world. Today, we have this opportunity to realize this beautiful wish, and we are immensely delighted to be able to spend the annual Water Festival with our Cambodian brothers and sisters in this most pleasant season. I would like to take this opportunity to express the sincere respect and kinship of Chinese women to you and, through you, to all Cambodian sisters."

Members of the Cambodian Royal Council, government ministers, speakers and members of parliament, and their wives, were also at the airport to welcome them today. Thousands of Cambodian women and overseas Chinese women also went to the airport to welcome them.
