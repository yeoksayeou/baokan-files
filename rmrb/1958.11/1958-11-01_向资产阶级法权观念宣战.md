Declare War on the Concept of Bourgeois Right
Arm Commune Members with Communist Ideology

    "Arm Commune Members with Communist Ideology" is the title of an editorial published in the fourth issue of Guangdong Provincial Party Committee's theoretical publication, "Upstream," published today. The editorial states that Guangdong Province has achieved people's communization in less than a month. The people's commune movement is a profound social change, and it must be reflected in people's minds. People's ideology often lags behind objective reality, which presents us with the important task of "arming commune members with communist ideology." The editorial analyzes that some upper-middle peasants have a resistant attitude towards the people's commune. They fear "collectivization" and "equalization." Ultimately, they are fantasizing about continuing on the capitalist road. The vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely support the commune. However, some people also have individualistic ideas, mainly reluctant to transfer part of their means of production to the commune without compensation; other people with more and stronger labor power are afraid of suffering losses after the implementation of the half-supply, half-wage distribution system. The most prominent issue at present is departmentalism among some cadres. This ideology is mainly manifested in the unwillingness of rich communes to merge with poor communes, large communes with small communes, and communes with more accumulation with communes with less accumulation. The editorial believes that all these erroneous ideas that are opposed to communism are manifestations of the concept of bourgeois right. Therefore, to establish a clear communist ideology and communist style, we must thoroughly break down the concept of bourgeois right. The editorial states that the concept of bourgeois right is the legalization of private ownership established on the basis of private ownership in capitalist society, the "sacred and inviolable" nature of private property, and the legalization of unequal status between people. This concept of bourgeois right has been basically crushed in our country by the impact of the socialist and communist torrent, but there are still remnants. These remnants are mainly manifested in the people's commune movement as nostalgia for individual interests, family interests, and small commune interests, while neglecting public and overall interests. We must eliminate it.
    
More "Each According to His Ability" Than "To Each According to His Work"

    The fourth issue of "New Analects," a theoretical publication sponsored by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, published today an editorial entitled "On 'Each According to His Ability, To Each According to His Work.'" The editorial says: There are two tendencies worth noting now. One tendency is that people fail to see that the people's commune, the combination of education and productive labor, the all-rounder movement, the communist labor attitude and spirit of cooperation, the supply system, etc., are the inevitable trends of objective development. They do not recognize them as sprouts of communism, but instead think that all these practices are "rash advances," "nonsense," and "errors" in theory. Thus, they doubt, resent, resist, and try to pull history backward. The other tendency is that people believe that once people's communes are realized, once life is collectivized, once primary school education is universalized and various red and expert schools are established, and once the supply system is implemented, that is communism. This wrong tendency is to confuse the advanced stage of communism with the lower stage, and to equate the sprouts of communism with the communist system.
    
    In the socialist stage, "each according to his ability" and "to each according to his work" are indispensable. However, these two aspects have different weights. There are two attitudes towards the importance of these. One is to emphasize "to each according to his work," and to emphasize the principle of material interests to stimulate people's enthusiasm for labor production. The other is to emphasize "each according to his ability," to emphasize putting politics in command and raising the people's communist consciousness to promote the development of production. The speed of social production development and the speed of the people's communist ideological consciousness improvement are slower due to holding the first attitude, and faster due to holding the second attitude.
    
    "Each according to his ability" contains a labor attitude and a labor force. These two are still constantly improving even in communism, while "to each according to his work" is the opposite. It has a certain role in the socialist stage, but it is a remnant of bourgeois right. Continuously and vigorously developing and improving "each according to his ability," while utilizing the role of "to each according to his work," but also adopting a policy of gradually reducing its role, is the most likely to accelerate socialist construction and gradually transition to communism. Comparing "each according to his ability" is endless, and the faster people progress, the higher their consciousness, and the stronger their abilities. "To each according to his work" cannot have a recognized absolutely reasonable standard of remuneration. The more one compares the level of labor remuneration, the more the remnants of private ownership are consolidated, the more low-level tastes there are, and the greater the contradictions between people, thereby affecting the development of social production and the change of the spiritual outlook.

Do Not Absolutize the Principle of Material Interests

    "Academic Monthly" published an article by Jin Ruobi in its tenth issue of 1958, entitled "A Brief Discussion on Several Issues Concerning the Labor Remuneration System in Factories and Enterprises at Present." The author points out that we must correctly handle the relationship between political and ideological work and the role of material incentives. The author criticized the view that the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses is mainly the result of the "principle of individual material interests." He said that what plays a decisive role here is the communist consciousness of the masses, the Party's political and ideological work, and not the role of material incentives. In our country, which is transitioning to communism in the not-too-distant future, the scope of material incentives will gradually shrink until it disappears completely.
    
    The author emphasized that those who hold the view that "making workers care about their labor results from material interests is an unshakable principle" have not seen the transformation of "to each according to his needs" and "to each according to his work." The former gradually replaces the latter in a crossover state from sprout to development and from development to disappearance, rather than suddenly changing when the socialist society is built and transitions to communist society. The idea that the principle of material incentives will always be effective is a reflection of maintaining the concept of bourgeois right, and it is also the ideological root of right-leaning conservatism in practical work.

Develop Equal Relations Between People

    "Eliminate the Concept of Bourgeois Right and Correctly Treat the Relationship Between Laborers" is the title of an article by Wang Dian published in the third issue of "Creation" magazine, sponsored by the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. The author points out that in our socialist country, the bourgeois right has been completely eliminated within the scope of the ownership of the means of production. However, in distribution and certain other aspects, some remnants still have to be preserved in the socialist stage, and therefore some inequalities still exist.
    
    The author points out that the concept of bourgeois right is opposed to the proletarian communist ideology as two opposing worldviews. The traditional style of our Party, which has been integrated with the masses in the long revolutionary struggle, is the embodiment of communist ideology. However, the bourgeoisie denigrates our Party's Marxist style and communist ideology as "rural style" and "guerrilla habits." Some of our comrades have been consciously or unconsciously influenced by the concept of bourgeois right and have gradually abandoned the "rural style" and "guerrilla habits," which have damaged our traditional style of close connection with the people to a certain extent.
    
    The author points out that since the rectification movement, we have restored and carried forward the "rural style" and "guerrilla habits," restored and carried forward the traditional communist style of our Party, thus greatly breaking down the concept of bourgeois right and further improving the relationship between laborers. What is decisive here is that cadres participate in labor. This has caused a major change in social atmosphere. People do not want any "overtime pay" and do not rely on any "material incentives," but strive to build socialism and transition to communism as soon as possible. This is precisely the victory of breaking down the concept of bourgeois right and the victory of the Marxist style.

### 向资产阶级法权观念宣战

    向资产阶级法权观念宣战
    用共产主义思想武装公社社员
    “用共产主义思想武装公社社员”，这是今天出版的广东省委的理论刊物“上游”第四期上发表的社论的题目。社论说，广东全省在不到一个月的时间中，实现了人民公社化。人民公社化运动是一场深刻的社会变革，不能不在人们的思想中得到反映。人们的思想意识往往落后于客观实际，这样就向我们提出了“用共产主义思想武装公社社员”的重大任务。社论分析说，一部分上中农对人民公社是有抵触情绪的，他们一怕“归公”二怕“拉平”。归根到底是幻想继续走资本主义的道路。广大贫农和下中农是坚决拥护公社的。但是，一部分人也存在着个人主义思想，主要是舍不得将自己的一部分生产资料无代价归公社；另一部分劳动力较多较强的人则生怕实行半供给半工资的分配制度后自己吃亏。目前比较突出的是一部分干部中的本位主义。这种思想主要表现为富社不愿和穷社并，大社不愿和小社并，积累多的社不愿和积累少的社并。社论认为，所有这些与共产主义相对立的错误思想都是资产阶级法权观念的表现。因此，要树立起鲜明的共产主义思想和共产主义风格，就必须彻底破除资产阶级法权观念。社论说，资产阶级法权观念，就是在私有制基础上建立起来的私有观念在资本主义社会里的合法化，就是私有财产的“神圣不可侵犯”，就是人与人间不平等地位的合法化。这种资产阶级法权观念，在我国受到社会主义、共产主义洪流的冲击，已基本上被冲垮了，但是还有残余，这种残余在人民公社化运动中主要表现为对个人利益、家庭利益和小社利益的留恋，而忽视公共利益和整体利益。我们必须加以破除。
    比“各尽所能”不比“按劳取酬” 
    今天出版的中共山东省委主办的理论刊物“新论语”第四期发表了一篇题为“论‘各尽所能，按劳取酬’”的社论。社论说：现在有两种倾向值得注意。一种倾向是看不到人民公社化、教育同生产劳动相结合、多面手运动、共产主义的劳动态度和协作精神、供给制等等是客观形势发展的必然趋势，不承认它们是共产主义萌芽，反而认为这一切做法是“冒进”，是“胡闹”，是理论上的“错误”，于是怀疑，反感，抵触，企图把历史拉向后退。另一种倾向是认为一实现人民公社化，一实现生活集体化，一普及小学教育和办起各种红专学校，一实行供给制，就是共产主义了。这种错误倾向是把共产主义的高级阶段和低级阶段混为一谈，把共产主义萌芽和共产主义制度等同起来。
    在社会主义阶段，“各尽所能”和“按劳取酬”是缺一不可的。但是，这两个方面是有轻有重的。对轻重的看法，有两种态度。一种是强调“按劳取酬”，强调用物质利益原则去刺激人的劳动生产的积极性。另一种是强调“各尽所能”，强调政治挂帅和提高人民的共产主义觉悟，去促进生产的发展。社会生产发展速度，人民群众共产主义思想觉悟提高的速度，由于持第一种态度则比较慢，由于持第二种态度则比较快。
      “各尽所能”包含着一个劳动态度，一个劳动力。这两者到了共产主义也仍然是不断提高的，而“按劳取酬”则相反。它在社会主义阶段有其一定作用，但它是资产阶级法权残余。不断大力发展和提高“各尽所能”，同时利用“按劳取酬”的作用，但又采取逐步缩小其作用的方针，这样最能加速社会主义建设和逐步过渡到共产主义。比“各尽所能”是无止境的，愈比人们的进步愈快，觉悟愈高，能力愈强。“按劳取酬”不可能有一个公认的绝对合理的报酬标准。愈比劳动报酬的高低，则私有制观念残余愈巩固，低级趣味愈多，人与人间的矛盾愈大，从而影响到社会生产的发展和精神面貌的改变。
  不要把物质利益原则绝对化
      “学术月刊”1958年第十期发表了一篇金若弼的文章，题目是“略谈目前工厂企业劳动报酬制度方面的几个问题”。作者指出，我们必须正确处理政治思想工作和物质鼓励作用的相互关系。作者批判了那种认为工人群众积极性和创造性的高度发挥主要是“个人物质利
  益原则”作用的结果的说法。他说，这里起决定性作用的是群众的共产主义觉悟，是党的政治思想工作，而不是物质鼓励作用。在我国过渡到共产主义已不是遥远将来的今天，物质鼓励作用的范围，势将逐渐缩小，直至完全消失。
    作者强调指出，那些持着“使工作者从物质利益上关心自己的劳动成果是不可动摇的原则”的人，没有看到“各取所需”和“按劳取酬”的转换，是在前者从萌芽到发展和后者从发展到消失的交叉状态中逐渐代替，而不是在社会主义社会建成后向共产主义社会过渡的时候突然改变的。认为物质鼓励原则永远是有效的思想，正是维护资产阶级法权观念的反映，也是实际工作中有右倾保守主义的思想根源。
    发展人与人的平等关系
      “破除资产阶级法权观念，正确对待劳动者的相互关系”，这是中共云南省委主办的“创造”杂志第三期所载王甸的一篇文章的题目。作者指出，在我们社会主义的国家，资产阶级法权虽然在生产资料所有制的范围内是彻底地被破除了。但是在分配上和其他某些方面，在社会主义阶段还不能不保存着若干残余，因而还存在着一些不平等的现象。
    作者指出，资产阶级法权观念与无产阶级的共产主义思想，是两种宇宙观的对立。我党在长期的革命斗争中与群众打成一片的传统作风，就是共产主义思想的体现。但是，资产阶级却把我党的马克思主义风格和共产主义意识形态，贬称为“农村作风”和“游击习气”，我们有些同志正是自觉或不自觉地受到资产阶级法权观念的影响，逐渐放弃了“农村作风”和“游击习气”，使我们与人民群众密切联系的传统作风遭受了一定程度的损害。
    作者指出，整风运动以来，我们恢复和发扬了“农村作风”和“游击习气”，恢复和发扬了我党传统的共产主义风格，因而大破资产阶级法权观念，使劳动者之间的相互关系进一步地得到了改善。在这里，有决定意义的是干部参加劳动。这就引起了社会风气的大改变，人们不要什么“加班费”，不靠什么“物质刺激”，在为早日建成社会主义和过渡到共产主义而奋斗。这正是破除资产阶级法权观念的胜利，马克思主义作风的胜利。
