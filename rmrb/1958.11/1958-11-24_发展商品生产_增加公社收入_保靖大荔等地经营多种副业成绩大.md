Develop Commodity Production, Increase Commune Income
Baojing, Dali, and Other Places Achieve Great Results in Operating Diverse Sideline Occupations

According to a report from the New Hunan Daily, Baojing County, in order to start preparing for next year's production funds and improve the people's livelihood as early as possible, is now vigorously developing diversified operations and doing everything possible to increase cash income. This ensures that all communes can issue wages and achieve "five immovables": not touching the commune's wage reserves, not touching the inventory cash turned in by small cooperatives, not touching the income from economic crops such as tung oil tea, not touching surplus grain and money, and not touching proceeds from livestock sales. By November 1, all fifteen people's communes in the county had issued their first wages, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the masses and pushing production to a new high tide.

After the people's communes in Baojing implemented a system combining partial supply and partial wages, they were warmly supported by the broad masses of commune members. But where did the wages come from? This was a practical problem that urgently needed to be solved. In October, not a single commune could achieve the "five immovables" while also guaranteeing the issuance of wages. At that time, among cadres and the masses, some advocated using inventory cash and physical assets, issuing as much as there was; some advocated temporarily borrowing from the state for the insufficient part; some advocated that since commune members were already eating without paying, there was no need to issue wages; and others advocated actively thinking of ways to avoid touching cash and goods, to vigorously grasp cash income from the soil, water, and mountains to solve the problem of issuing wages.

The Baojing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, using the Red Flag Commune and Yangchao Commune as key examples, set an example to educate cadres with facts. In these two communes, the masses were mobilized to start with production, vigorously grasp cash income, and solve the wage funding problem. Cadres of the Red Flag Commune, through debating the question of "retreating in the face of difficulty or overcoming difficulties and advancing," criticized conservative ideas such as "labor shortages make it difficult to grasp sideline occupations," "deducting wage reserves," and "borrowing from the state." They clarified that the superiority of the people's communes should be fully utilized, relying on the communist consciousness and strength of the masses to vigorously solve the problem of issuing wages. The commune Party committee promptly unified labor arrangements, organized a sideline production brigade of more than 500 people, with transportation, sewing, carpentry, and odd jobs all going into action. Products such as wine, sugar, fiber, and lime were quickly produced, earning more than 5,000 yuan in three days of hard work, and finally issued wages ahead of schedule on October 17. Through surveying, accounting, and labor arrangements, commune members of the Yangchao Commune worked hard and cleverly, achieving a cash income of 45,000 yuan in half a month, with a surplus of 30,000 yuan after issuing wages.

Based on the pilot work of the Red Flag and Yangchao Communes, combined with the overall situation in the county at that time, the county committee decided to vigorously grasp diversified operations from mid-October, strive for a cash income of 300,000 yuan, universally issue wages in November, and achieve the "five immovables." To achieve this plan, the following main measures were taken: Secretaries took the lead, everyone took action, and the commune was used as a unit to organize a sideline production corps. Ten percent of the labor force in the county was transferred to vigorously grasp cash income. Yang Guoxiang, Deputy Secretary of the County Committee, took the lead, and each commune had a Deputy Secretary specifically in charge of this work. The main contents of sideline occupations were to focus on transportation, timber rafting, firewood, charcoal, winemaking, sugar making, papermaking, etc. It was also stipulated that grasping cash income from sideline occupations should be used as one of the important conditions for the county's autumn and winter production inspection and evaluation. The battle to vigorously develop sideline occupations and grasp cash quickly unfolded universally in all communes in the county. The Bi'er Commune, after four days of hard work, opened up sixteen sources of income, earning more than 20,000 yuan, and is expected to collect a cumulative total of 48,000 yuan in October, leaving a surplus of more than 10,000 yuan after issuing October wages. In order to solve the difficulty of winemaking raw materials, the Yangchao Commune decided that October 19 would be a day for collecting winemaking raw materials, mobilizing more than 4,000 people. After a day of hard work, more than 320,000 catties of wild plants such as Smilax glabra and fern roots were collected. The income from wine sales on the 24th alone could reach more than 20,000 yuan, guaranteeing a surplus of 7,000 yuan after issuing wages in November. The county operated a total of twenty-five sideline projects, earning more than 320,000 yuan in cash by the end of October. In addition to issuing wages for November, there was still more than 100,000 yuan left, which could be transferred to the wages for December or used as working capital within the commune.

After implementing the food supply system, the people's communes also issued their first wages. This was truly a great happy event unprecedented in thousands of years, and the enthusiasm of the commune members was even higher and their motivation even stronger. Wang Changsheng, a poor peasant in his sixties from the Red Flag People's Commune, said excitedly after receiving his wages: "In the past, I had to be in debt every year, but now I have money coming in every month. If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the people's communes, where would I have today's happiness!" When it rained at night, he automatically got up, put on a raincoat, and went with the young people to rush to harvest late corn. Originally, according to his age, he was not required to work night shifts, but he insisted on going.

(By our newspaper) Dali County, on the Guanzhong Plain in Shaanxi Province, has vigorously developed sideline production and carried out diversified operations, greatly enriching the production content of the plain areas. Under the slogan "Mountains have mountain products, land has local products, eat what the mountains provide, eat what the plains provide," they mobilized cadres and the masses to start from the characteristics of the plains, think of more ways in light of local conditions, and found many sideline opportunities. The plains have no wild animals to hunt, but they can develop animal husbandry. The number of pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, etc. here has doubled compared to last year, sericulture has also expanded compared to last year, and beekeeping has become a production that is prevalent throughout the county. More than 2,500 high-quality breeds of rabbits such as "Angora" have been bred in the county. Fish fry were released for the first time this year in some waterlogged ponds and small reservoirs. Now, in some places with gullies, dams are being built to store water in conjunction with water conservancy construction, preparing to raise a large number of fish next year. In the past, it was said here that the problem of feed could not be solved and collective pig raising was not possible. This year, it was discovered that leaves and almost all grasses can become good feed after processing such as steaming, boiling, grinding, and pressing. Feed factories have been established in every commune and team, and collective pig raising has developed to more than 28,000 heads in a very short time. Although the medicinal materials here are not as many as in the mountainous areas, it is not that there are none.

In the utilization of crop roots and stems, a broad path has also been opened up here. New production industries such as using corn stalks to make sugar, cotton stalk skins to make fiber, and wheat stalks to braid straw hats have emerged here. Dali County has some saline-alkali land, and a large amount of sugar beets were planted this year, which also developed sugar production. In the Chengguan District, more ways were thought of to utilize waste materials, such as using rope ends to make recycled cotton, and using rags and old shoe uppers to make shoe soles, which also increased a lot of income. Last year, this county had forty kinds of sideline production, and this year it has developed to more than one hundred items. Now, everyone who can work has something to do, making it so that there are no idlers in the villages, and cash income has greatly increased. Last year, the county's total sideline income was only more than 1.2 million yuan, but this year, by October, it had already received more than 2.5 million yuan from sideline occupations. Dali County has focused on solving the labor problem in developing sideline production. The plain areas have always had the saying that agricultural work is tight and there is no time for sideline occupations. Dali County's labor force was originally not very abundant, and this year's great leap forward in industry and agriculture, especially since the large-scale steel production and deep plowing in late August, has made the labor force even tighter. Therefore, many cadres and the masses proposed to abandon the original basic sideline occupations, let alone develop new ones. In response to this situation, the Party committees of each commune and township conducted item-by-item research and analysis on sideline production. As a result, each commune discovered a lot of labor potential. Originally, in addition to full and semi-laborers, there were still many people who could do work here. For example, children from twelve to sixteen years old and the elderly over fifty-five years old can do some work. Furthermore, agricultural laborers cannot go to the fields on rainy days, and this opportunity can be used to vigorously develop sideline occupations. After studying and analyzing this situation, many units made reasonable arrangements. Some sideline occupations that do not require strong labor, such as spinning cotton stalk fiber and degumming cotton stalk skins, are done by the elderly. Three couples around sixty years old in the Dongfanghong People's Commune contracted three rabbit farms. There are also some sideline occupations that only require a small amount of strong labor. For example, pig raising only requires heavy work for bedding and taking the pigs out of their pen, so a few strong laborers are drawn to do the bedding and taking the pigs out of their pen, and light work is given to the elderly. The Red Flag People's Commune also implemented three shifts for sideline occupations: strong replacing the elderly, men replacing women, and adults replacing children. The Dongfanghong People's Commune compiled a number of fixed sideline occupation teams according to this principle, 70% of whom were elderly and children. In addition, some communes, in response to the situation that commune members had no work to do on rainy days, specially arranged some jobs such as weaving mats, specially prepared for hard work on rainy days, so that commune members have field work on sunny days and home work on cloudy days. After a reasonable arrangement of labor, although the tasks of iron smelting and autumn harvest and autumn planting were very tight in September and October, sideline production was not affected, but was more lively and bustling than in the previous months. The Dongfanghong People's Commune, which had temporarily stopped sideline production in August, extracted more people to coke in September and October, but the sideline income in these two months increased to 68,000 yuan, only more than 10,000 yuan short of catching up with the total sideline production income in the first eight months. This is three times more than the same period last year.

(By our newspaper) Strengthen leadership, comprehensively arrange, vigorously carry out winter sideline production, and ensure that the sideline income of four million yuan is completed before the end of the year to solve the pocket money for commune members to spend during the New Year and festivals. This is the decision made by the Xining Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the recent meeting of cadres above the production team leader of the people's commune.

Under the correct leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in Xining City have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests in industrial and agricultural production this year. In agriculture, grain yield per mu crossed the Yangtze River nine years ahead of schedule. In terms of steel smelting, the smelting tasks for September and October were overfulfilled by 23.6%. Other aspects of work are also developing by leaps and bounds.

However, due to the large-scale basic construction tasks this year, such as water conservancy construction, tool reform, afforestation, steel smelting, and deep plowing, sideline production has been somewhat relaxed, and commune members generally feel that pocket money is difficult. In order to reverse this situation, the Xining Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting of cadres above the production team leader, and decided, on the principle of not hindering industrial and agricultural production, to rely on the masses, use local materials, and carry out diversified winter sideline production, ensuring that the sideline income task of four million yuan is completed before the end of December.

Their main ways of engaging in sideline production are: digging gypsum, digging mirabilite, engaging in transportation, smashing stones, and engaging in by-product processing. The specific methods are: 20% of the vehicles and 30% of the people in the city are drawn out to engage in sideline production, and the remaining vehicles and labor force engage in industrial and agricultural production. Organize professional teams, implement the four-determination system of determining personnel, tasks, time, and responsibilities, so that industrial, agricultural, and sideline production are not missed.

In order to ensure the completion of this task, the meeting also determined that each commune and each team should draw out one secretary to specifically lead sideline production. It is also necessary to check every three days and compare every five days to achieve good labor, good production, good rest, and more income. At the same time, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and let the masses start a debate to achieve policy understanding, ideological understanding, and method understanding.

This plan was very popular when discussed among the masses. Within three days, more than 2,200 various vehicles and more than 16,000 laborers were dispatched to start sideline production. Currently, the daily income is nearly 100,000 yuan. In this way, the wages and pocket money of the commune members will not only be fully solved, but there will also be surplus money for expanding reproduction.

    发展商品生产　增加公社收入
    保靖大荔等地经营多种副业成绩大
    据新湖南报消息　保靖县为了及早动手筹办来年生产资金和改善群众生活，现在即大力开展多种经营，千方百计增加现金收入，从而保证了社社发放工资，做到了“五不动”——不动公社工资底垫、不动小社上交的库存现金，不动桐茶等经济作物收入、不动余粮余钱、不动牲畜变价款。到11月1日，全县十五个人民公社都已发放了第一次工资，大大鼓舞了群众积极性，把生产推向了一个新的高潮。
    保靖各人民公社实行部分供给和部分工资相结合的制度以后，获得了广大社员群众的热烈拥护。但工资从哪里来呢？这是一个急需解决的实际问题。从10月份没有一个社能够做到“五不动”，同时又能保证发放工资。当时在干部和群众中，有的主张动用库存现金和实物价款，有多少发多少；有的主张不够部分向国家暂借；有的主张社员已经吃饭不要钱，不必发工资；还有的主张积极想办法，不动现钱现货，从土里、水里、山里大抓现金收入，来解决发工资的问题。
    中共保靖县委以红旗公社和阳朝公社为重点，作出榜样，以事实教育干部。在这两个社发动群众从生产入手，大抓现金收入，解决发工资的资金。红旗公社干部通过辩论“知难而退，还是克服困难前进”的问题，批判了“劳力紧张难抓副业”、“扣工资底垫”、“向国家借款”等保守思想，明确了应该充分发挥人民公社的优越性，依靠群众的共产主义觉悟和力量，大力解决发工资问题。社党委及时统一安排劳力，组织了一支五百多人的副业大队，运输、缝纫、木匠、小工等一齐出动，酒、糖、纤维、石灰等产品迅速出厂，苦战三天就收入五千多元，终于提前在10月17日发了工资。阳朝公社通过摸底、算账和劳力安排，社员群众猛干苦干巧干，半个月现金收入就达四万五千元，发了工资还可剩余三万元。
    县委根据红旗、阳朝两个公社的试点工作，结合当时全县情况，决定从10月中旬起，大抓多种经营，争取收入现金三十万元，11月份普遍发工资，并且做到“五不动”。为了实现这个计划，采取了以下主要措施：书记挂帅，全民动手，以公社为单位，组织一个副业生产兵团，全县抽调10％的劳动力，大抓现金收入。县委由杨国湘副书记挂帅，各公社都有一个副书记专管这项工作。副业内容主要是抓住运输、放木、木柴、木炭、酿酒、制糖、造纸等。还规定把抓副业的现金收入，作为全县秋冬生产检查评比的重要条件之一。大搞副业、抓现金的战斗很快就在全县各公社普遍展开了。比耳公社苦战四天，开辟了十六项财源，收入二万多元，10月份累计可收四万八千元，除发10月份工资外，还可剩余一万多元。阳朝公社为了解决酿酒原料困难，决定10月19日为采集酿酒原料日，动员了四千多人，苦战一天，采集了土茯苓、蕨根等野生植物三十二万多斤，24日一天出酒收入可达二万多元，保证11月份发工资后，还可剩余七千元。全县共经营了二十五个副业项目，到10月底收入现金三十二万多元，除可发11月份工资以外，还剩下10多万元，可转入12月份的工资或作社内周转资金用。
    各人民公社在实行伙食供给制后，又发放了第一次工资，真是几千年来没有过的大喜事，社员群众的情绪更高，干劲更足了。红旗人民公社六十多岁的贫农王昌生领到工资后兴奋地说：“过去我年年要欠账，现在月月有钱进，要不是有毛主席和人民公社，哪有今天的幸福！”夜晚落雨了，他自动爬起床来，戴上个斗篷，跟青年人一道去抢收晚包谷。本来照他的年纪是不要他打夜工的，但他坚持要去。
    本报讯　陕西关中平原上的大荔县，大力发展副业生产，进行多种经营，大大丰富了平原地区的生产内容。它们在“山有山货土有土产，在山吃山，在川吃川”口号下，发动干部群众从平原特点出发，因地制宜多想办法，找出了许多副业门路。平川没有野兽可供打猎，但是可以发展饲养业。这里的猪、羊、鸡、鸭等比去年整整增加了一倍，蚕桑也比去年扩展了，养蜂已经成为一项遍及全县的生产，全县已繁殖了“安格拉”等良种兔二千五百多只。在一些涝池和小水库里，今年头一次放了鱼苗。现在一些有沟壑的地方，结合水利建设筑坝蓄水，准备明年大量养鱼。以前这里说饲料问题解决不了不能集体养猪，今年发现树叶和几乎所有的草经过蒸、煮、碾、压等加工之后，都可以成为很好的饲料。社社队队都建立了饲料厂，集体养猪在很短时间内就发展到二万八千多头。这里的药材虽然不像山区那样多，但也不是没有。
    在农作物根茎的利用上，这里也打开了广阔的门路，这里出现了用玉米秆制糖、棉秆皮制纤维、麦秆编草帽辫等新的生产行业。大荔县有一些盐碱地，今年大量种植了甜菜，同时也就发展了制糖生产。在城关区更多地从废物利用上想了办法，如用绳子头制再生棉，用破布、旧鞋帮作鞋底等，也增加了不少收入。在去年这个县有四十种副业生产，今年就发展到一百多项。现在凡是能劳动的人就有活干，作到了村村无闲人，现金收入大大增加。在去年全年全县副业收入只一百二十多万元，而今年到10月就已经从副业上收入了二百五十多万元。大荔县在发展副业生产上，着重解决了劳力问题。平原地区从来就有农活紧张，没有时间搞副业的说法，大荔县劳动力本来就不大充裕，今年工农业大跃进，特别是8月下旬大搞钢铁生产和深翻地以来，劳动力就更紧张了。因此有不少干部和群众，提出要把原有基础的副业都丢掉，更不必说发展新的副业了。针对这种情况，各公社和乡的党委，对副业生产逐项进行了研究分析，结果各社都发现了不少劳动潜力。原来这里除了整、半劳动力以外，还有不少能做活的人。比如十二岁到十六岁的娃娃，五十五岁以上的老人，都能做一些活。再则农业上的劳动力到了下雨天不能下地，利用这种时机也可大搞副业。在研究分析了这种情况以后，许多单位都进行了合理安排。有些不需要强劳力的副业，如纺棉秆纤维和棉秆皮脱胶等，都让老年人去作。东方红人民公社三对六十岁左右的老夫妇，就包了三处养兔场。还有些副业，只需要少量的强劳力。如养猪只有垫圈、出圈是重活，就抽几个强劳力垫圈、出圈，轻活让给老人去作。红旗人民公社还实行了副业三换班，壮年换老年，男人换妇女，大人换小孩。东方红人民公社则按照这个原则编了若干固定副业专业队，其中70％都是老人和小孩。另外有些公社针对雨天社员没活干的情况，特别安排下一些活路如编席等，专备下雨天大干特干，使社员们晴天有地里活，阴天有家里活。经过合理安排劳力，9、10月份虽然炼铁和秋收、秋种任务很紧张，但副业生产却没有受到影响，反比以前几个月搞的红火热闹。曾在8月份一度停止副业生产的东方红人民公社，9、10月份虽然抽出了更多的人去炼焦，但是这两个月的副业收入却增长到六万八千元，只差一万多元就赶上了前八个月副业生产收入的总和。比去年同期整整增加了三倍。
    本报讯　加强领导，全面安排，大力开展冬季副业生产，保证在年底以前完成副业收入四百万元，解决公社社员过年过节的零用钱。这是中共青海西宁市委在最近召开的人民公社生产队长以上干部会议上作出的决定。
    西宁市各族人民，在党的正确领导下，今年工农业生产获得空前大丰收。在农业方面，粮食亩产提前九年跨过了长江。在钢铁冶炼方面，超额23.6％完成了9、10月份的冶炼任务。其它各方面工作也都在一日千里地飞跃发展着。
    但是由于今年的兴修水利、工具改革、植树造林、冶炼钢铁、深翻土地等基本建设任务大，副业生产有某些放松，社员的零用钱普遍感到困难。为了扭转这种情况，中共西宁市委最近召开生产队长以上干部会议，决定在不妨碍工农业生产的原则下，依靠群众，就地取材，开展多方面的冬季副业生产，保证在12月底以前完成四百万元的副业收入任务。
    他们搞副业生产的门路主要有：挖石膏、挖芒硝、搞运输、砸石头、搞副产品加工等。具体办法是：全市抽出20％的车辆和30％人从事副业生产，其余车辆和劳力从事工农业生产。组织专业队，实行定人员、定任务、定时间、定责任的四定制度，做到工、农、副业生产三不误。
    为了确保这一任务的完成，会议并确定由每个公社、每个队抽出书记一人，专门领导副业生产。并且要做到三天一检查，五天一评比，做到劳动好、生产好、休息好、收入多。同时要充分发动群众，让群众展开辩论，作到政策通、思想通、办法通。
    这一计划在群众中讨论时很受欢迎，三天内即出动了各种车辆二千二百余辆，劳动力一万六千多个，开始进行副业生产。目前每天收入近十万元。这样，社员的工资和零用钱不仅全部解决，而且还有余钱用于扩大再生产。
