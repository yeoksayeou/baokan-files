Xinhua News Agency, 15th: TASS issued a statement on the 14th, condemning the US and UK governments for continuing to play tricks and obstruct an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. The statement reiterated that if these two governments "are truly willing to stop nuclear weapons testing, then the Soviet government is still willing to sign an agreement with them immediately." The statement said: "However, in this case, the US and UK governments should abandon clumsy tricks and declare themselves ready to take this step."

The statement pointed out that because the US and UK governments played indecent tricks at the United Nations General Assembly, the Assembly was unable to pass a resolution conducive to the universal and permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing. Instead, the Assembly passed the US and UK proposals, which aimed to obstruct an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and to continue nuclear weapons testing.

Judging from the recent statements by US President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, the US and UK governments still intend to obstruct an agreement on the cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. They are still putting forward some demands as preconditions for stopping nuclear weapons testing, which render their statements about being willing to stop such testing meaningless.

The statement said that no matter what tricks US leaders play on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing, they will still not be able to cover up the truth in the future. The truth is that the above two governments disregard the will of the people of all countries who demand an end to atomic and hydrogen weapons testing and the immediate and permanent cessation of such testing.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet government is still willing to immediately sign an agreement with the US and UK on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, if they are truly willing to do so. As for the issue of monitoring the cessation of testing, such monitoring is entirely possible.

The statement said that, however, whether from the above statements of the US and UK leaders, or from the attitude of their representatives at this Geneva conference, it is clear that the US and UK are unwilling to do so.

The statement said that the representatives of the US and UK at the Geneva experts' meeting once said that they were not authorized to discuss the issue of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and that such an agreement should be discussed separately in the future. However, now that a special meeting has been convened to study the issue of concluding an agreement, strong arguments have once again been heard from the Geneva venue, saying that the task of this meeting is also to study the issue of monitoring, rather than concluding an agreement on the cessation of nuclear explosions. The statement said that this alone shows how far the false words of the US and UK leaders, expressing their willingness to stop nuclear weapons testing, are from the true position of these countries.

The statement concluded by saying that the Soviet Union has always insisted and will continue to insist that nuclear weapons testing must be stopped immediately, universally, and permanently. It is convinced that this demand is in line with the aspirations of the people of all countries, in line with the interests of easing international tensions, and can eliminate the threat of atomic war.

    谴责美英无理阻挠停止核试验
    苏联愿意立即签订协定  美英应当放弃拙劣花招
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社14日发表声明，谴责美英两国政府继续玩弄花招，阻挠就停止核武器试验问题达成协议。声明再次表示，这两国政府“如果真正愿意停止核武器试验，那么，苏联政府仍然愿意同它们立即签订协定”。声明说：“但是，在这种情况下，美国和英国政府就应当放弃拙劣的花招，而声明自己准备走这一步。”
    声明指出，由于美国和英国政府在联合国大会上耍弄不体面的把戏，大会没有能够通过有助于普遍、永久地停止核武器试验的决议，而通过了美英两国的建议，它们建议的目的是阻挠就停止核武器试验问题达成协议和继续进行核武器试验。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯以及英国外交大臣劳埃德最近的声明来看，美英政府今后仍打算阻挠就停止试验原子武器和氢武器达成协议。它们仍旧提出一些要求作为停止核武器试验的先决条件，这些要求使得它们关于愿意停止这种试验的声明失去了一切意义。
    声明说，不管美国领导人在停止试验核武器问题上耍什么花招，他们今后也仍然无法掩盖真相。而真相就是，上述两国政府对要求结束原子武器和氢武器试验并立即永远停止这种试验的各国人民的意志不予理睬。
    声明指出，苏联政府现在依然愿意同美英两国立即签订停止核武器试验的协定，如果它们真正愿意这样做的话。至于对停止试验的监督问题，这种监督是完全可能的。
    声明说，但是，无论从美英两国领导人的上述声明来看，或者从他们的代表在这次日内瓦会议上的态度来看，美英两国显然不愿意这样做。
    声明说，美英两国的代表在日内瓦专家会议上曾经说过，他们没有受权讨论关于停止核武器试验的协定问题，并且说这种协定应当在将来专门讨论。可是，现在已经召开专门会议来研究缔结协定的问题了，但是从日内瓦会场里又重新传出了强词夺理的说法，说什么这次会议的任务也是研究监督的问题，而不是缔结停止核爆炸的协定。声明说，光这一点就已经说明，美英两国领导人表示他们愿意停止核武器试验这些假话同这些国家的真正立场相差有多么远。
    声明最后说，苏联过去和将来都坚持必须立即、普遍、永远地结束核武器试验，它深信，这种要求符合各国人民的愿望，符合缓和国际紧张局势的利益，并能消除原子战争威胁。
