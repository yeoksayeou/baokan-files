Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods to Control the Weather
Gu Zhenchao, Researcher at the Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

In this year's Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, many new tasks have been put forward for agricultural science. The same is true for weather control work. In order to seize more cotton and grain from nature, the vast number of farmers have waged arduous and heroic struggles against adverse weather. For example, XuShui county has not rained for one or two months this year, but the farmers, under the leadership of the Party, have overcome this and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. However, our struggle against the weather has not yet achieved final victory. In some areas, such as Hubei and Gansu, some crops have been damaged by floods, hail, and frost. This raises the question of how to further control the weather and use the laws of natural change to serve agricultural production.

This issue is particularly important at present because, after the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the unit area yield has increased dramatically. If crops suffer from natural disasters, the losses are also particularly large. Losing a thousand acres of crops now is equivalent to losing tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of acres of crops in the past. No wonder some of our farmers are heartbroken when they see the high-yielding wheat about to be harvested being damaged by hail. Therefore, the masses have put forward an urgent demand for weather control. Gansu, Jilin, Shandong, Anhui, and Hebei have all proposed artificial rainfall, early spring snow melting, hail prevention, frost prevention, and so on. The farmers in YuMen County said that they would give whatever was needed as long as it could rain. In fact, people in some places have already started to do it themselves. For example, the masses in ZhangYe Prefecture, Gansu Province, are organized to go to the mountains in spring to melt snow for irrigation; farmers in DingXi Prefecture are organized to prevent hail. They are very enthusiastic. The masses are determined to conquer the weather. If our leaders at all levels, relevant professional departments, and natural scientists do not see the urgent demands of the masses and start preparing as soon as possible, we will be very passive.

        Is it possible to control the weather?

Is weather control possible? The answer is yes. Although nature has infinitely great power, and we cannot yet fight a hard battle with it and change the weather arbitrarily anytime, anywhere, natural forces are blind, and there are many loopholes to exploit. It is also often unstable and easily triggered, so in some cases, we can use little effort to create relatively large weather changes. According to experiments in the past ten years or so, both in practice and in theory, it has been proven that we can control the weather. The Soviet Union, the United States, Australia, and many other countries have carried out large-scale artificial rainfall work. The Soviet Union has achieved good results in hail and fog elimination, and is developing rapidly. Our people also have effective methods for hail prevention. Clouds that don't rain can be made to rain, and clouds that don't dissipate can be made to dissipate. This is already the first step. With this first step, there will be more complete and further control methods.

Scholars in capitalist countries, due to the limitations of their thinking methods and world outlook, do not see the possibility of large-scale weather control and doubt its practical value. They often give very negative evaluations of artificial rainfall work. This is very natural. In fact, large-scale weather control is not only possible, but also has great economic value. According to the experience of Jilin's rainmaking this year, it costs less than one cent to produce one cubic meter of water. Using this water for irrigation and power generation, the economic benefits are dozens to hundreds of times more than the money spent. The experience of the Soviet Union in several aspects also proves that the rainwater obtained by artificial rainfall costs less than one cent per cubic meter, so it is very cost-effective. No wonder there are even many private artificial rainfall institutions in capitalist countries. In terms of hail prevention, the cost of using foreign methods is more expensive, but we also have indigenous methods.

Of course, we also need to consider this situation. That is, because the weather and terrain conditions in some of our areas are special, artificial rainfall and other work will be more difficult, and it will cost more to explore at the beginning. For example, in the northwest region of our country, on the one hand, it is very dry, and there is a lack of water in the air, so it is not easy to make rain. Moreover, the places that are more suitable for making rain are mountainous areas, and transportation and supply are not convenient, so more manpower and materials are required. However, it may cost a little more at the beginning, but it will be much cheaper later. It is necessary to endure the pain and buy some experience first. Don't forget that because our unit area yield is high, the benefits of artificial rainfall are also great. What was not cost-effective in the past is now cost-effective. What is not cost-effective for capitalist countries is cost-effective for us. This is very possible. Not to mention that we cannot only calculate economic accounts, but also ideological and political accounts. Since ancient times, it has always been said that we rely on heaven for food, and natural disasters are difficult to prevent; however, we believe that man will conquer nature, and we must wage a resolute struggle with nature. The development of weather control work can help establish the idea that man will conquer nature. Since ancient times, the government has only been in charge of disaster relief, but our people's government can lead the masses to overcome the weather. This kind of political influence and ideological influence will inevitably be extremely far-reaching.

It can be seen that weather control work is not only urgently needed, but also possible and has the conditions to be developed. Actively carrying out this work will greatly benefit the masses. Not actively carrying out this work will lead to economic and even political losses. Therefore, weather control work should be one of the marshals of China's current meteorological work.

In fact, several regions in our country have carried out weather control work this year. Since August, Jilin has been making rain, Hebei has been eliminating clouds, Gansu has been making rain and eliminating clouds, etc. Some have regarded it as a large-scale production task, and some have regarded it as an experiment, and all have achieved certain results.

Jilin Province suffered from drought in July, and the crops were about to dry up, and the industry was also seriously affected. The local government seized the opportunity to do it quickly, not only achieving good results, but also the work is indeed at the international level. They conducted many artificial rainfall experiments, and the success rate of using dry ice to seed clouds and make rain was about 80%. According to incomplete statistics, they have produced 60 million cubic meters of water. This achievement is considerable. They broke many conventions and tried every means to do it. In the past, rainmaking mostly used so-called "cumulus clouds" one by one, but they saw that these clouds were not large in area and the amount of water produced was limited, so they changed to using "high-altitude cloud rain clouds" that covered the entire sky as the target, and sprinkled a large amount of dry ice, so that it rained when there was no rain, and light rain became heavy rain, with very good results. The dry ice they used also broke the conventions, not restricted by international rules and regulations, and used a large amount of it, expanding the impact. Their enthusiasm is very great. For example, dry ice was produced by the Jilin Fertilizer Plant within a week, and the output was guaranteed to be fully supplied. The aircraft modification work was completed in one day. The pilots were even more daring. As long as it could rain, they would definitely try to fly into the clouds that ordinary aircraft would avoid to spread the medicine.

The drought in the northwest is a regular problem, and it is also a great obstacle to the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in the northwest. In the future Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the amount of water used for irrigation will increase, the cultivated land will also be expanded, and the construction of factories and mines will require a large amount of water. In order to meet the water requirements, they carried out many weather control experiments in the Hexi region this year through large-scale cooperation in various aspects. The first is artificial rainfall, using the clouds on the Qilian Mountains to make rain and snow in the mountains. Second, there is a lot of ice and snow on the Qilian Mountains, so when we need water, we melt these ice and snow and let them flow down the river. Finally, because the Hexi region is dry, the evaporation loss in the reservoir is very serious after the water flows down, so they also conducted experiments to reduce evaporation. Because there is more water storage in the low-lying areas of Hexi, and the area is large, the problem of reducing evaporation is also very important.

In terms of artificial rainfall, they experimented about twenty times, using various materials such as dry ice, silver iodide, salt powder, salt water, water, and quicklime. Experiments have proved that even very light clouds can be used for artificial precipitation, let alone thick clouds. This shows that it is very promising to use artificial precipitation in the Qilian Mountains to help Hexi solve the problem of water use. This negates the argument that rain cannot be made in the Qilian Mountains. Ice melting and snow melting have been carried out many times in various parts of the Qilian Mountains, and the snow melting efficiency is relatively high. Key experiments have also been conducted to reduce evaporation. New methods are being explored.

In addition, the experiments on cloud elimination in Hebei and the experiments on cloud elimination and precipitation in Nanjing and Hubei have also achieved results.

The road to weather control

When carrying out these tasks, although there are many different situations, there is one thing in common, that is, starting from scratch and leading by laymen. We have not organized and carried out weather control work in the past, so naturally there is no foundation and a lack of experts. There is only one meteorological staff member in Jilin Province responsible for it, and he is still a junior college graduate. But they are very enthusiastic and have achieved very good results, reaching the international level. Although Gansu has comrades who have been engaged in meteorological work for a long time, they have never dealt with clouds and fog, and have never engaged in artificial precipitation. Some of them originally felt that weather control was a difficult and important task, and they did not dare to start. They thought that it would take several years to wait for foreign students, experts, and equipment. However, when they had enough enthusiasm, they rushed up. As a result, a lot of talents have been trained in these tasks. Therefore, daring to do it is the most important thing. If the technical strength is weak, we must do it boldly. If we do it, we will know it, and the technical strength will be strong. We must not wait.

Another lesson learned from this year's weather control work is that the results are good if the local Party committee attaches importance to it, leads it personally, and seizes the opportunity to do it; otherwise, it will be worse. For example, Jilin City has done a lot of fast, good, and economical work in weather control because the local Party committee took the initiative to propose artificial rainfall after hearing the masses' demands for drought prevention, and established a special organization, with the Party committee personally taking charge. It should be pointed out that weather control is a complex task with a great impact. Taking artificial rainfall as an example, just using aircraft to spread dry ice involves the preparation and modification of aircraft, driving and scheduling, weather forecasting and command, airports and repairs; it involves the manufacture and transportation of dry ice, processing and spreading, considering the consequences and impacts of rainmaking (not to mention the scientific observations that should be carried out at the same time). This requires the cooperation of aviation departments, chemical departments, transportation departments, communications departments, meteorological departments, agricultural and forestry departments, water conservancy departments, and so on. Not only general cooperation, but also breaking conventions. For example, artificial rainfall needs to be carried out in special weather conditions, and it is even more necessary to fly in dangerous weather. In this way, whether it is driving or scheduling, we cannot follow our original set of systems. The new tasks must have a new set of methods. Only under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, personally taking charge, and providing specific assistance can we work together to focus on the key points and ensure that the task is easy to develop. Without a special organization responsible for the work, handing the work over to a department, or taking it on by a department, it will not be done well.

Because weather control is not yet a mature science, we should also explore in multiple ways. Artificial rainfall should be carried out by burning silver iodide to produce smoke, it should be carried out by using balloons or even airplanes and anti-aircraft tools to load silver iodide, and it should also be carried out by using Kongming lanterns, earthen cannons, and double bangs. We must use carbon black and coal to carry out ice melting and snow melting, and we must also learn from the villagers to use plant ash. In short, we must try every means to try and try in many ways. Even foreign methods must not be limited to the existing circles. There must be better artificial rainfall agents in nature than silver iodide, and there must be better materials for preventing evaporation than hexadecanol. Dry ice seeding clouds to make rain is effective, but is liquid air better? Spraying salt water is okay, but is spraying other solutions better? Quicklime and calcium chloride are okay, but can magnesium sulfate and saline-alkali soil also play a role? We should liberate our minds and experiment boldly, especially we should humbly learn indigenous methods from the masses. The masses have methods of burning plant ash to melt snow and burning firewood to make rain. These methods should be seriously studied and should not be easily dismissed with the sentence "this is not scientific". Some methods have been proven effective by the masses for many years, but we have never carefully studied and experimented with them, and it is wrong to easily deny them with some "principles". Indigenous methods also have their reasons, and weather control work should be carried out by combining indigenous and foreign methods. Many foreign methods come from indigenous methods. For example, using dry ice to seed clouds was initially done boldly by laymen, and now it has become a foreign method.

In short, weather control is urgently needed by the masses, and it is an effective and beneficial task. As long as we seize it and start in many ways, this task is promising. Under the leadership of the Party committee, relying on the masses, working together, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and actively carrying out weather control work, we will definitely be able to do this work well.

    土洋并举，控制天气
    中国科学院地球物理研究所研究员　顾震潮
    在今年的农业生产大跃进中，给农业科学提出了许多新的课题。对于天气的控制工作也是如此。为了向大自然夺取更多的棉花和粮食，广大农民向不良气候作了艰苦卓绝的英勇斗争。像徐水县今年有一、两个月时间没下雨，但农民在党的领导下，也抗过来了，并且得到了空前的大丰收。但是，我们对天气的斗争，毕竟还没有得到最后的胜利。有些地区，像湖北、甘肃一带，还有一些庄稼受到涝灾、雹灾、霜冻的损害。这就给我们提出了一个问题，如何进一步把天气控制住，并利用自然变化的规律，为农业生产服务。
    这个问题在目前之所以显得特别重要，还由于农业生产大跃进后，单位面积产量惊人的提高，如果庄稼遭受自然灾害，损失也特别大。现在损失一千亩的庄稼，就等于过去损失几万亩乃至几十万亩的庄稼，无怪我们有些农民看到快要收割的丰产小麦被雹子打坏时，心痛得要哭。因此，群众提出了对天气控制的迫切要求。甘肃、吉林、山东、安徽、河北都纷纷提出要人工降雨、早春融雪、防雹、防冻等等。玉门县的农民说，只要能下雨，要什么给什么。事实上，有的地方群众已经自己动手干起来了。像甘肃张掖专区群众有组织地在春季上山融雪浇地；定西专区的农民组织起来防雹。劲头都很大。群众决心要征服天气。我们各级领导、各有关专业部门和自然科学家，如果看不到群众这种迫切要求，及早动手准备，就会非常被动。
        控制天气是可能的吗？
    对于天气的控制是不是可能呢？回答是肯定的。因为虽然自然界有着无限巨大的能力，我们要同它打硬仗，想随时随地任意改变天气还不能办到，但是，自然力是盲目的，它有许多空子可以下手。它又常常是不稳定的，一触即发的，因此，有的情况下，我们可以费不大的劲，造成比较大的天气变化。根据近十几年来的试验，不论在实践上或理论上，都已经证明，我们可以对天气加以控制。在苏联、美国、澳洲和其他许多国家，已经开展了较大规模的人工降雨工作。在苏联消雹、消雾工作有着很好的成绩，发展很快。我国群众对防雹也有行之有效的办法。现在密云不雨的可以使它下雨，阴云不散的可以叫它消散。这就已经走了第一步。有了这第一步，也就会有更完全、更进一步控制的办法。
    资本主义国家的学者，由于思想方法和世界观的限制，看不到大规模天气控制的可能，怀疑它的实用价值。他们对人工降雨的工作常常作很消极的评价。这是很自然的。事实上，大规模天气控制不但是可能的，并且也是有很大的经济价值的。根据今年吉林造雨的经验，搞一立方水还花不到一分钱。用这些水来浇地、发电，经济收益要比所花的钱多几十倍到几百倍。苏联好几方面的经验也证明，人工降雨搞到的雨水每一立方米还不到一分钱，因此，是十分合算的。无怪在资本主义国家甚至还设有许多私营的人工降雨机构。在防雹方面，用洋办法费用要贵一些，但我们还有土办法。
    当然，也需要估计到这样的情况。那就是由于我们有些地方天气和地形条件特殊，人工降雨等工作要困难一些，开始摸索时会花钱多一些。像在我国西北地区，一方面是非常干旱，空气中缺少水份，造雨本来就不容易，又加比较适宜于造雨的地方又是山区，交通供应也不方便，人力物力要费得多。但是，开始时可能多花一点，以后就要便宜多了。忍痛先买一些经验是必要的。也不要忘记，由于我们单位面积产量高，人工降雨的收益也大。过去不合算的，现在就合算。对资本主义国家说来，不合算的，对我们说来就合算。这是很可能的。更不必说我们不能光算经济账，也要算算思想账、政治账。从古以来，总说靠天吃饭，天灾难防；但是，我们相信人定胜天，并且要和自然作坚决斗争。天气控制工作的展开就可帮助确立人定胜天的思想。从古以来政府只管救灾，但我们的人民政府就能领导群众战胜天时。这种政治影响，思想影响，必然是极为深远的。
    由此可见，天气控制工作不仅是迫切需要的，也是可能的，有条件展开的。积极地开展这工作群众会得到很大的好处。不积极开展这工作就会招致经济上乃至政治上的损失。因此，天气控制工作应该是我国当前气象工作的元帅之一。
    事实上，今年我国已经有好几个地区开展了天气控制的工作。8月份以来吉林造雨，河北消云，甘肃造雨和消云等等，有的把它当作大规模的生产任务，有的是试验，都收到一定的效果。
    吉林省，在7月里遭到旱灾，庄稼快要干死，工业也受到严重影响。地方上抓紧大搞快搞了一下，不仅得到了良好效果，而且工作的确是国际水平的。他们进行了许多次人工降雨，用干冰撒云造雨成功的约占80％。据不完全的统计，他们搞下的就有六千万立方的水。这成绩是可观的。他们打破了许多常规，千方百计地来搞。过去造雨多用一朵朵的所谓“积状云”，但他们却看到这种云面积不大，出水有限，就根据需要，改把遮住全天的“高层云雨层云”作为对象，大撒干冰，使得无雨时下雨，小雨变大雨，效果很好。他们用的干冰也打破常规，不受国际上清规戒律的限制，大量施用，扩大了影响。他们的干劲是很大的。像干冰是吉林肥料厂一星期之内突击制成的，而且产量保证了充分供应。飞机改装工作是一天之内突击完成的。飞行员更是大胆，只要能降下雨来，一般飞机见了就要躲开的云，他们也一定想办法飞进去撒药。
    西北干旱是个经常性的问题，对西北工农业大跃进更是很大的阻碍。在今后工农业生产大跃进中，田里浇水要增加，耕田还要扩大，厂矿建设更需要大量用水。他们为了满足水的要求，由各方面大协作，今年曾在河西地区进行了许多天气控制的试验。首先是人工降雨，利用祁连山上的云在山里搞下雨雪来。其次，祁连山上冰雪很多，在我们需要水的时候使这些冰雪融化流下河来。最后，因为河西干燥，水流下来以后在水库里蒸发损失很厉害，因此，还进行了减少蒸发的试验。由于河西洼地蓄水比较多，面积广，减少蒸发的问题也是很重要的。
    在人工降雨方面，他们试验了约二十次，用了干冰、碘化银、盐粉、盐水、水、生石灰等各种各样的材料，试验证明，即使是很淡的云，也可以进行人工降水，更不必说浓的云了。这说明，在祁连山中用人工降水来帮助河西解决用水问题是很有希望的。这就否定了祁连山里不能造雨的论调。融冰、化雪已在祁连山各地进行了多次试验，融雪效率还比较高。减少蒸发工作也进行了重点试验。现在正在探索新的方法。
    此外，河北消云的试验，南京、湖北消云和降水试验，也是有成绩的。
    控制天气的道路
    在进行这些工作时，尽管有许多情况不尽相同，但有一点是共同的，那就是白手起家，外行带头。我们过去不曾有组织地开展过天气控制的工作，自然没有一点基础，缺少专家。吉林省只有一个气象人员负责，还是一个专科毕业生。但是他们干劲很大，成绩很好，达到国际水平。甘肃虽有从事气象工作比较久的同志，但也从没有和云雾打过交道，从没有搞过人工降水。在他们有些人中，原来觉得天气控制是件难事、是件大事，不敢动手。认为总还要好几年，等留学生、等专家、等器材。但是，当他们干劲一足，一冲也就冲上去了。结果，在这些工作中培养出好多人才。因此，大胆地干，是最重要的。技术力量弱更要大干，干了就会，技术力量就强了。千万不能等。
    今年控制天气的工作中另一条教训是，凡是地方党委重视，亲自领导，抓紧来搞的，成绩就好；反之，就要差些。像吉林市对天气控制工作搞得多快好省，就是因为地方党委听到群众纷纷要求防旱后，主动提出人工降雨，并且成立了专门机构，党委亲自挂帅来抓。应该指出，天气控制是一件复杂的工作，影响又大。就人工降雨来说，光用飞机撒干冰就牵涉到飞机的准备和改装，驾驶和调度，天气预报和指挥，机场和修理；牵涉到干冰的制造和运输，加工和撒布，考虑造雨的后果和影响（还不说应该同时进行的科学观测）。这就需要航空部门，化工部门，运输部门，通讯部门，气象部门，农林部门，水利部门等等各方面的协作配合。不但要一般的配合，并且要打破常规。譬如人工降雨需要在特殊天气下进行作业，有危险天气时反而更需要飞行。这样，不论驾驶和调度，就不能照自己原有的一套制度办事，新的任务就必需要有一套新的办事办法。只有在地方党委的统一领导，亲自挂帅，具体帮助下，才能通力围绕重点，保证任务工作容易展开。没有专门机构负责，把工作交给一个部门，或者由什么部门揽下来，是搞不好也搞不了的。
    由于天气控制究竟还不是成熟的科学，我们也应该多路探索。人工降雨应该用碘化银烧烟来搞，应该用汽球甚至飞机、高射工具装碘化银来搞，也应该用孔明灯、土炮、双响等等来搞。我们要用炭黑、煤炭，来作融冰化雪的工作，我们也要学老乡用草木灰来搞。总之，是要千方百计地试，多方面的试。就是洋办法也决不能局限于已有的圈子里。自然界中一定有比碘化银更好的人工降雨药剂，也一定有比十六碳醇更好的防止蒸发的材料。干冰催云下雨有效、液体空气是否更好？喷盐水可以，喷别的溶液是否更好？生石灰、氯化钙可以，硫酸镁、盐碱土是否也能起作用？这都值得我们解放思想、大胆试验一下，特别是我们应该虚心向群众学习土办法。群众有烧草木灰融雪，烧柴草造雨的办法，这些办法应该郑重研究，不能用“这不科学”一句话轻易抹杀。有些办法群众多年使用证明有效，而我们从没有仔细研究试验过，凭一些“原理”轻易否定是不对的。土办法也是有道理的，应该土洋并举地进行天气控制工作。许多洋办法正是土办法里来的。像用干冰撒云当初就是由外行大胆搞出来的，到现在就成了洋办法。
    总之，天气控制是群众迫切需要的，也是有效的，有利的工作，只要我们抓起来，多方面下手，这工作是大有可为的。我们在党委领导下，依靠群众，通力协作，土洋并举，积极开展天气控制工作，就一定可以做好这项工作。
