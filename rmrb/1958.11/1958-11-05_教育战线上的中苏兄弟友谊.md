In the collaborative section of the "Exhibition of the Combination of Education and Productive Labor" in the Comprehensive Hall, there is a showroom with the glittering gold letters "Peace and Friendship" inlaid on the screen at the entrance in Chinese, Soviet, and other languages. The lecture manuscripts, books, instruments, documents, photos, statistical data, and banners displayed inside tell us that this is the crystallization of great internationalism, and tell us how much tremendous selfless assistance the Soviet people have given to our country's education cause over the past few years.

Enthusiastically Work, Selflessly Labor

From the exhibits, it can be seen that since 1951, more than 700 Soviet experts have come to our country to teach in schools. They have helped our schools establish 337 teaching and research offices and 559 laboratories, and have trained a large number of new teachers. One picture after another, with explanations, introduces the experts working selflessly in classrooms, laboratories, workshops, and construction sites. One set of exhibits records the situation of Dr. Dubinin lecturing at Huazhong Institute of Technology for the refresher course for teachers of metalworking teaching and research groups from more than 40 industrial colleges in China. This red expert, who came from a working-class background and participated in the Great Patriotic War, raised the question of work on the day he arrived at Huazhong Institute of Technology on December 12 last year. When Chinese comrades wanted him to rest after the long journey, he said, "I came to China to work, not to rest." In his lectures, he especially emphasized practical operation. The expert himself spent five afternoons going deep into the six workshops of the internship factory, lecturing while working. In the three weeks of lectures, he wrote and translated 300,000 words of lecture notes. At that time, there was no Russian typist, so the expert and his wife personally typed them out.

Another set of exhibits introduces the deeds of experts Sabreykin, Solizon, and others, who helped several universities in our country establish a complete set of television teaching from scratch, from setting up majors and teaching and research offices to compiling teaching outlines and training teachers, unreservedly passing on their experience and knowledge to Chinese comrades. Soviet expert Solizon, who helped build a television station at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, worked hard with Chinese comrades in the teaching and research office for two days and nights to produce the main components. This expert did not forget this matter when he returned to his country for the summer vacation, and sacrificed his vacation to find a very valuable component, which he sent from the Soviet Union from afar. Now this component is displayed in the exhibition hall.

 Gifts from Afar

Among the exhibits are many gifts from Soviet friends, including instruments, books, and specimens. Some were beloved items that the experts carried with them and left to Chinese comrades as souvenirs when they were about to return home; others were sent from the Soviet Union after a long journey. Each item can tell us a story of friendship.

Here is a "Timber Structure Design Manual" that is out of print in the Soviet Union. It was personally given by expert Kagan to the Engineering Teaching and Research Office of Harbin Institute of Technology. This book was baptized by the flames of war during the Great Patriotic War, and a large piece of the cover was burned off. Dr. Kagan often carried it with him as a souvenir, calling it a priceless "heavenly book." However, when his work in China was completed and he was about to return home, Dr. Kagan left the book to Chinese comrades as an eternal souvenir. Among the many newly published original books on display, there are several broken or old books, which are all beloved rare books of the experts, and they were given to Chinese comrades.

More are the exchanges between schools. From the exhibits, it can be seen that since 1949, 66 universities in our country and 85 universities in the Soviet Union have been giving gifts to each other like brothers and exchanging research experiences. Beijing University in our country lacked Arctic plant specimens in its teaching. Moscow University in the Soviet Union sent a complete set of 100 Arctic tundra plant specimens at one time, solving the need in this aspect of teaching. Beijing University collected bird specimens from southern China and selected 40 species to send to Soviet comrades. In the autumn of 1957, when the Boiler Teaching and Research Office of Harbin Institute of Technology was preparing for an experiment, it encountered difficulties and wrote to Professor Knoere, director of the Boiler Teaching and Research Office of Bauman University of Technology in the Soviet Union, for advice. The professor was ill when he received the letter, but he still dictated a letter while ill, answering in detail the questions raised by the Chinese comrades, and sent their experimental guidance book for the Chinese comrades to refer to. This contact has continued to this day, and all questions are answered.

 Unforgettable Friendship

Soviet experts left deep friendship in China. After returning to their motherland, they still care about China's socialist construction and are concerned about our country's anti-aggression struggle. On display here is a long letter written by expert Sabreykin on September 24 this year, in which he angrily condemned the US imperialists' provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait region of our country. He wrote: "Friends! ...If necessary, I can also go to the front line with you to defend the cause of socialism and communism with weapons in hand!" Many letters from Soviet experts who have returned to their country are full of enthusiastic encouragement and support for China's peaceful construction cause.

In China, wherever Soviet experts have been, they have left the best memories for Chinese comrades. What is particularly moving is the memory of Soviet teachers and Soviet classmates by some of our students studying in the Soviet Union exhibited here. Since liberation, universities in the Soviet Union have accepted thousands of students from our country. From the photos, it can be seen that these students in the Soviet Union, as if they were in their own homes, are cared for and loved everywhere. In classrooms, laboratories, factories, construction sites, farms, and among Soviet soldiers, they can meet relatives everywhere. Look! Here are many photos of Chinese and Soviet students taken together, and a batch of articles written by students studying in the Soviet Union, with titles such as "In the Ocean of Friendship," "Forever Unforgettable Friendship," "Recalling Our Tutors"... Student Wang Mogeng returned to the home of a Soviet classmate with his Soviet classmate during the holiday. The Soviet mother called him "child," and the younger siblings called him "brother." When he participated in voluntary labor in a collective farm, an elderly farmer heard that he was a Chinese student and told him: "Children must study hard so that they can go back and build your motherland in the future!" One of the articles on display was written by Xiang Yun, a Chinese student at the Odessa Institute of Water Conservancy Engineering. He described the situation of Sergei Vladimirovich, director of the Hydraulic Engineering Teaching and Research Office, tutoring Chinese students. In addition to three or four hours of lectures each time, the professor also gave individual tutoring three times a week. Once, regardless of fatigue, he lectured from 10 am to night, and during the holidays, he went to the internship construction site to find his Chinese students. Xiang Yun wrote in the article: "Thank you, Sergei Vladimirovich! We will never forget your care and help for us! We will never forget the enthusiasm and friendship brought to us by the Soviet people!"

Gratitude, remembrance, and unforgettable friendship have deeply planted the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people in everyone's hearts, taking root, growing branches, blossoming, and bearing huge internationalist fruits!

    教育战线上的中苏兄弟友谊
    新华社记者　魏文华
    在“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”综合馆的协作部分，有一间陈列室，门口的屏风上用中苏等国文字镶着闪闪发光的金字“和平与友谊”。室内陈列的讲义手稿、书籍、仪器、文件、照片、统计资料、锦旗……，都告诉我们这是伟大的国际主义的结晶，告诉我们几年来苏联人民对我国教育事业给了多么巨大的无私的援助。
    热情地工作，忘我地劳动
    从展品看到，自从1951年以来，苏联专家已有七百多人来我国学校讲学。他们帮助我们的学校先后建立起三百三十七个教研室、五百五十九个实验室，培养了大批新的师资。一幅一幅的照片和说明，介绍了专家们在课堂、实验室、车间、工地在忘我地劳动。有一组展品，纪录了杜比宁博士在华中工学院为我国四十多个工业高等院校金属工学教研组教师进修班讲学的情形。这位工人出身曾参加过卫国战争的红色专家，去年12月12日到达华中工学院后，当天就提出工作的问题。中国同志要他在长途跋涉之后休息一下时，他说：“我来中国是工作的，不是来休息的”。在讲学中，他特别强调实际操作，专家自己用五个下午的时间深入到实习工厂的六个车间边作边讲，在三星期的讲学中共写书译文三十万字的讲稿。当时没有俄文打字员，专家自己和夫人亲自动手打出来。
    还有一组展品，介绍专家萨布雷金、索利宗等同志的事迹，他们帮助我国几所高等学校从无到有白手起家，建立起整套的电视教学，从设立专业、教研室，到编写教学大纲和培养师资，都无保留地把自己的经验和知识教给中国同志。到北京邮电学院帮助建立电视台的苏联专家索利宗，和教研室的中国同志一起苦战两昼夜，制成了主要部件。这位专家暑假回国也不忘怀这件事，又牺牲自己的休假，设法找到一个非常贵重的部件，从苏联远道寄来，现在这个部件陈列在展览馆中。
          远方赠礼
    展品中有许多是苏联朋友的赠品，包括仪器、书籍、标本等，有的是专家们随身携带心爱的东西，临回国时留给中国的同志作纪念的；有的是万里迢迢从苏联寄来的，每一件都能给我们讲出一段友谊的故事。
    这里有一本在苏联已经绝版的“木结构设计手册”，是专家卡冈博士亲自赠给哈尔滨工业大学工程教研室的，这本书在卫国战争期间受过战火洗礼，封面被烧去一大块，卡冈博士经常随身携带作为纪念，自己称它为无价的“天书”。可是在中国工作完了要回国时，卡冈博士就把这本书留下给中国同志作为永恒的纪念。在展出的许多最新出版的原版书籍中间，有好几本破了或旧了的书，都是专家们心爱的珍本，送给了中国同志。
    更多的是学校和学校之间的来往联系，从展品中看到，从1949年以来，我国的六十六所高等学校和苏联的八十五所高等学校像兄弟一样地互相赠送礼物，交换研究心得。我国北京大学教学中缺北极的植物标本，苏联莫斯科大学一次就送来了一百份全套的北极冻原植物标本，解决了教学中这一方面的需要；北京大学收集到我国南方的鸟类标本，也挑了四十种送给苏联同志。1957年秋季，哈尔滨工业大学锅炉教研室筹备一项实验时，发生了困难，去信向苏联包曼工学院锅炉教研室主任克诺烈教授请教。教授接到信正在生病，但仍抱病口述书信，详细地答复了中国同志提出的问题，并寄来了他们的实验指导书供中国同志参考。这一联系至今不断，都是有问必答。
        难忘的友谊
    苏联的专家们，在中国留下了深情厚谊，回到自己的祖国后仍然时刻关怀着中国的社会主义建设，关心我国的反侵略斗争。这里陈列着专家萨布雷金在今年9月24日写的一封长信，信中愤怒地斥责美帝国主义在我国台湾海峡地区的挑衅行为。他写道：“朋友们！……如果需要的话，我也能够同你们一起到前线去手执武器，来保卫社会主义和共产主义事业！”从回国的苏联专家那里来的许多封信，都对中国的和平建设事业充满着热情的鼓励和支持。
    在中国，凡是苏联专家们到过的地方，他们都给中国同志留下了最好的回忆。特别使人感动的，是在这里展出的我国一部分留苏学生对苏联老师、苏联同学的怀念。解放以来，苏联国内的高等学校接受我国成千的留学生，从照片中可以看到，这些留学生在苏联各地，仿佛到了自己的家一样，到处受到关怀和爱护，他们在课堂、实验室、工厂、工地、农场、苏军战士中间，处处都能遇到亲人。你看！这里的许多张中苏学生一起照的照片，留苏学生们写的一批文章，题目都是“在友谊的海洋中”、“永远难忘的友情”、“回忆我们的导师”……。留学生王墨耕在假期和苏联同学一起回到苏联同学的家，苏联妈妈把他叫“孩子”，弟妹们叫他“哥哥”，到集体农庄参加义务劳动，老年农民听见是中国的留学生，告诉他：“孩子要好好学习，将来好回去建设你们的祖国！”有一篇展出的文章，是敖德萨水利工程学院的中国留学生祥云写的，他记述了水工教研室主任谢尔盖·符拉基米洛维奇辅导中国留学生学习的情况。教授对中国学生除了每次三、四小时的讲课外，每周还个别辅导三次，有一次不顾疲劳从上午十点讲到晚上，假期又到实习工地上去找他的中国学生。祥云在文章中写道：“谢谢你，谢尔盖·符拉基米洛维奇！我们永远也不会忘记你对我们的关怀和帮助！我们永远也不会忘记苏维埃人带给我们的热情和友谊！”
    感谢，忆念，难忘的友谊，就这样把中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊，深深地种在每个人的心田里，生根，长枝，开花，结出硕大的国际主义果实！
