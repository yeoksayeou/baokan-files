Xinhua News Agency, November 29th: Liu Zhijian, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a report this afternoon to the National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists entitled "Combine Labor and Military Affairs, Build the Motherland, Defend the Motherland."

In his report, Liu Zhijian first pointed out that there are two major tasks facing the Chinese people: building socialism and defending socialist construction. The people of the whole country and the youth of the whole country should each learn two sets of skills: to be able to work and to be able to fight. Be skilled in labor, and be a hero in battle.

Liu Zhijian said that this form of combining labor and military affairs is the valuable experience gained by the Party and Chairman Mao in leading the Chinese people to victory in the revolutionary struggle. Today, we must also implement the method of combining labor and military affairs in building socialism: on the one hand, implement universal conscription; on the other hand, the army participates in production. The army and the people are trained to be versatile people who are both literate and martial, and who are also workers, farmers, and soldiers. This has inestimable significance for building and defending the motherland.

Liu Zhijian then talked about the new atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward that has emerged in the People's Liberation Army in terms of political ideology, military work, and participation in socialist construction after a series of political movements such as rectification and socialist education in the past year or so. He said that since April this year, the "Five Goods" movement initiated by the youth representatives of the Third National Congress of Youth, which aims to study hard, take good care of weapons and equipment and all public property, eliminate accidents, save production, and exercise, has been widely carried out throughout the army and has achieved remarkable results. Through this movement, the communist consciousness of the troops has been further enhanced. At the same time, the vast number of cadres in the army, responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for officers to go down to the company as soldiers, have also brought about tremendous changes in the ideological outlook and work style of the troops.

When talking about the achievements made in the military training work of the troops this year, Liu Zhijian said that due to the launching of the "one specialty with multiple capabilities, one soldier with multiple uses" movement throughout the army, in a very short period of time, many regiments and divisions of "multi-skilled gunners," "multi-skilled artillerymen," and "multi-skilled tankmen" appeared in the army, and many "multi-skilled sailors," "multi-skilled ships," and "multi-skilled air and ground crew" appeared, which greatly strengthened the combat effectiveness of the troops. Liu Zhijian also introduced the situation of the troops carrying out invention and creation, popularizing secondary and university education, soldiers learning philosophy, carrying out cultural activities, supporting and participating in socialist construction, and the heroic struggle on the Fujian front. In terms of supporting and participating in socialist construction alone, the entire army participated in nearly 40 million workdays by the end of October this year, an increase of nearly double compared with last year. This year, the industrial production carried out by the troops themselves has reached one million workdays, and the agricultural production carried out by themselves has been nearly 30 million workdays.

Next, Liu Zhijian talked about the issue of universal conscription. He said that in the future, local militia organizations should continue to develop in conjunction with production labor. Militia organizations at all levels should conduct regular political education and military training, establish the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, learn to use the weapons in their hands and certain military knowledge, and improve their combat skills. Liu Zhijian said that the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army were formed under the direct education of the Party and Chairman Mao, and in the long revolutionary war. These glorious traditions are also the most fundamental characteristics of the People's Army. The militia is an armed force of the masses under the leadership of the Party and should learn and carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army.

    劳动是能手　打仗是英雄
    刘志坚在全国青年积极分子大会上说：人人都应该学会两套本领
    据新华社29日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部副主任刘志坚今天下午在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上以“劳武结合，建设祖国，保卫祖国”为题作了报告。
    刘志坚在报告中首先指出，摆在我国人民面前的有两大任务：建设社会主义和保卫社会主义建设。全国人民和全国青年，每个人都应该学会两套本领，既要能劳动，又要会战斗。劳动起来是能手，打起仗来是英雄。
    刘志坚说，这种劳武结合的形式，是党和毛主席领导中国人民进行革命斗争取得胜利的宝贵经验。今天我们建设社会主义，也要实行劳武结合的办法：一方面实行全民皆兵；一方面军队参加生产。军队和人民都锻炼成能文能武、亦工亦农亦兵的多面手，这对建设和保卫祖国具有不可估量的伟大意义。
    刘志坚接着谈到了一年多以来人民解放军经过整风和社会主义教育等一系列的政治运动之后，在政治思想、军事工作、参加社会主义建设等各方面所出现的大跃进的新气象。他说，今年4月以来，全国第三次青年代表大会部队青年代表所倡议的努力学习好、爱护武器装备和一切公物好、消灭事故好、节约生产好、锻炼身体好为目的的“五好”运动已在全军广泛开展并且取得了显著成效。通过这个运动，进一步提高了部队的共产主义觉悟。同时，全军广大干部响应党中央和毛主席提出的军官下连当兵的号召后，也使部队的思想面貌、工作面貌发生了巨大的变化。
    在谈到今年部队军事训练工作所取得的成绩时，刘志坚说，由于在全军开展了“一专多能，一兵多用”运动，在很短的时间内，全军就出现了许多“多能枪手”、“多能炮手”、“多能坦克手”的团和师，出现了许多“多能水兵”、“多能舰艇”和“多能空地勤人员”，这就大大加强了部队的战斗力。刘志坚还介绍了部队中大搞发明创造、普及中学和大学教育、士兵学哲学、开展文化活动、支援和参加社会主义建设、福建前线的英勇斗争等方面的情况。仅在支援和参加社会主义建设方面，全军到今年10月底止，参加劳动近四千万个劳动日，比去年增加了将近一倍。今年部队自己进行的工业生产已达一百万个劳动日，自己进行的农业生产已近三千万个劳动日。
    接着，刘志坚谈到了全民皆兵的问题。他说，今后，各地民兵组织还要结合生产劳动继续发展，各级民兵组织要进行经常的政治教育和军事训练，树立全心全意为人民服务的精神，学会使用手中的武器和一定的军事知识，提高作战的本领。刘志坚说，人民解放军的优良传统，是在党和毛主席的直接教养下，在长期革命战争中形成的，这些光荣传统，也就是人民军队最根本的特点。民兵是党领导下的群众性的武装，应该很好地学习和发扬人民解放军的优良传统。
