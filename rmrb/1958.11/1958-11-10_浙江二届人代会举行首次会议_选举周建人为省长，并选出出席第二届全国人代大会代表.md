Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 5th: The first session of the Second People's Congress of Zhejiang Province was held in Hangzhou from October 27th to November 2nd.

　　Zhou Jianren, Governor of Zhejiang Province, delivered a work report to the congress on behalf of the previous People's Committee. The report pointed out that in the past year, Zhejiang Province has achieved tremendous achievements in various construction undertakings. In agriculture, this year's spring crops (winter wheat, broad beans, rapeseed, etc.) increased by 100% compared to last year, early rice increased by more than 200% compared to last year, and late autumn crops are beginning to be harvested, with unprecedentedly good conditions. It is estimated that the total grain output for the year will double compared to last year. The cotton harvest is expected to reach over 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Ramie, oil crops, tea, silkworm cocoons, and other cash crops also had an all-round bumper harvest. The number of pigs, sheep, and other livestock raised has also increased significantly. All aspects have greatly exceeded the targets set by the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. The great leap forward in agricultural production has promoted the great leap forward in industrial production. From January to September, the total industrial output value increased by 105% compared to the same period last year. In terms of culture, education, and health, a high tide of cultural revolution has been set off throughout the province. The number of people who became literate this year alone is eight times greater than the total number in the past eight years. The number of universities has increased from the original eight to ninety. Twenty-four counties and cities in the province have basically eliminated the four pests, and thirty-seven counties and cities have basically eliminated schistosomiasis. Half of the townships in the province have established hospitals, with a total of 2,136 township hospitals, 1,221 rural maternity hospitals, and 12,853 rural health stations. The all-round great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, culture, education, health, and other undertakings has inspired greater enthusiasm among the broad masses of farmers. Within one month in September, the entire province realized people's communes, with over 97% of farm households participating in the communes, thus further promoting the high-speed development of socialist construction. Governor Zhou Jianren also proposed ambitious targets for next year's industrial and agricultural production and other undertakings.

　　During the congress, Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a political report to the congress. He elaborated on the domestic and international situation, the situation in the Taiwan region, and the United States' conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Finally, he particularly pointed out that the situation in all aspects requires us to work harder. 1959 is the decisive year in the three years of hard struggle. Everyone must muster greater enthusiasm and strive for higher speed development; and not only must we work hard to accelerate socialist construction, but we must also actively create conditions for a gradual transition to communism.

　　At the end of the congress, Zhou Jianren was elected Governor of Zhejiang Province, Huo Shilian, Li Fengping, Wu Xian, Chen Weida, and Ren Yili were elected as Deputy Governors, Ding Zhenlin and thirty-nine others were elected as members of the Provincial People's Committee, and Wu Zhonglian was elected President of the Zhejiang Provincial Higher People's Court.
