Good Rest and Good Labor
Zeng Zhi

The members of the Second Red Flag People's Commune in Cangzhou City, Hebei, were full of energy and motivated during the previous period of hard work, achieving great results in production. However, due to a long period without sufficient rest, people gradually became tired, and their motivation was not as high as before. The Party Committee Secretary of the commune understood this situation and made comprehensive arrangements for production and rest, ensuring that the members had enough rest time. As a result, labor efficiency greatly increased, and a new atmosphere of "two highs and three satisfactions" emerged: high morale of commune members, high production efficiency; good rest, satisfaction of the masses; proactive work by commune members, satisfaction of leading cadres; fast completion of tasks, satisfaction of higher authorities.

People have come to clearly recognize the great subjective initiative of people from the countless facts since the Great Leap Forward. Although the subjective initiative of people is remarkable, all human actions must still be subject to objective natural laws, that is to say, one cannot violate objective natural laws. Violating objective laws will lead to failure and errors. For an individual, in addition to work, one also needs to eat, sleep, and rest. Although some individuals may skip eating or sleeping for a day due to work needs, this can only be temporary and is a last resort. Therefore, work (or production) and rest must be appropriately arranged.

However, some people still do not understand this principle. When they talk about the issue of rest, they say: Now the production tasks are so tight, and the hard work cannot be completed. If we take time to rest, it will be even more impossible to complete it! These comrades are commendable for their determination to complete the tasks, but unfortunately, they do not understand that rest after hard work, and rest after labor, is precisely to accumulate strength, and precisely to better and faster complete new production tasks. If we were to express this relationship in a formula, it would be: good labor - good rest - even better labor.

Now, many local leading cadres, like the leading cadres of the Second Red Flag Commune in Cangzhou City, have made proper and practical arrangements for the labor, study, and rest time of the masses, ensuring that the masses can eat well and fully, sleep well, and rest well after strenuous labor, so as to always maintain vigorous energy and full motivation, thereby completing production tasks faster and better. These comrades can be said to be good at mastering and applying objective laws. It is hoped that those comrades who still do not care about the combination of work and rest will quickly learn from others.

    休息好和劳动好
    曾志
    河北沧州市第二红旗人民公社社员，在前一个时期的苦战中，个个精神饱满，干劲十足，在生产上获得了很大成就。但是，由于长期没有足够的休息，人们都慢慢地困乏了，干劲也不像以前那样了。这个社的党委书记了解了这种情况，对生产休息作了全面安排，保证社员有足够的休息时间，这样，劳动效率又大大提高起来，出现了两高三满意的新气象，这就是：社员情绪高，生产效率高；休息得好，群众满意；社员干活主动，领导干部满意；任务完成得快，上级满意。
    人的伟大的主观能动作用，人们已经从大跃进以来的无数事实中认识得很清楚了。人的主观能动作用虽然了不起，但是人的一切行动还必须受客观自然规律的支配，也就是说，不能违反客观自然规律。违反了客观规律，就要遭受失败，就要发生错误。以一个人来说，除了工作，还要吃饭、睡觉和休息。个别人虽然因为工作需要，可以一天不吃饭或一天不睡觉，但是这只能是暂时的，而且是不得已的。因此，工作（或生产）和休息必须适当安排。
    但是也有些人至今还不明白这个道理。他们一谈到休息问题，就说：现在生产任务这样紧张，苦战还完不成，再要抽时间休息，那就更完不成了！这些同志完成任务的决心的确可嘉，但可惜他们不懂得苦战后的休整，劳动后的休息，正是为了积蓄力量，正是为了更好更快地完成新的生产任务。如果要把这种关系用公式表现出来的话，那就是：劳动好—休息好—劳动更好。
    现在很多地方的领导干部，已经像沧州市第二红旗公社的领导干部一样，对群众的劳动、学习和休息时间，作了妥善的、切实的安排，保证群众在吃好吃饱的同时能够睡好，在紧张的劳动之后能够休息好，以便经常保持旺盛的精力，十足的干劲，从而把生产任务完成的更快更好。这些同志可以说是善于掌握和运用客观规律的人。希望那些至今还不关心劳逸结合的同志，赶快向别人学习。
