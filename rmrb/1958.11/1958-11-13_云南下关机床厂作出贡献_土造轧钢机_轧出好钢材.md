Xinhua News Agency News: The veteran workers of the Bai, Han, and other ethnic groups at the Xiaguan Machine Tool Factory in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province, recently jointly researched and created an indigenous rolling mill capable of producing five tons of small steel products per day.

The characteristics of this indigenous rolling mill are: simple to manufacture, easy to operate, and can be widely promoted in places where there is power equipment. Its main parts consist of only one belt pulley, four belts, five gears, three rollers, and one bracket, and it can be driven by only twenty horsepower. This indigenous rolling mill has a total of nine grooves and can produce round steel or ribbed steel in six specifications, ranging from one meter to three meters in length and four centimeters to twenty-two centimeters in diameter.

This indigenous rolling mill was initially trial-produced in 1956. However, since the factory at that time only produced general agricultural implements and did not urgently need steel, the rolling mill was shelved. Recently, after the factory was converted into a machine tool factory, the demand for steel increased greatly. Based on the opinions of the veteran workers, and under the leadership and encouragement of the factory's Party branch, the rolling mill was reorganized and improved and formally put into production.

After a period of formal production, it has been proven that the quality of this indigenous rolling mill is good, and the various specifications of steel produced are uniform in thickness, without honeycomb holes, and the tensile and compressive strength meet the requirements. At present, the vast majority of workers in the factory's forging workshop have mastered the operating technology of this rolling mill.

### 云南下关机床厂作出贡献  土造轧钢机  轧出好钢材

    土造轧钢机  轧出好钢材
    据新华社讯　云南省大理白族自治州下关机床厂的白、汉等族老工人，最近共同研究创造了一台日产五吨小型钢材的土轧钢机。
    这种土法轧钢机的特点是：制作简单，操作方便，凡有动力设备的地方，都能大量推广。它的主要零件只有一个皮带盘、四根皮带、五个齿轮、三根滚筒和一个支架，只要二十马力就可以带动运转。这种土法轧钢机共有九槽，可以生产一公尺至三公尺长，四厘米至二十二厘米六种规格的圆钢或竹节钢。
    这台土轧钢机在1956年就已初步试制出来，由于当时这个厂只生产一般农具，并不迫切需要钢材，这台轧钢机就一直搁置下来。最近这个厂转为机床厂以后，钢材需要量大增，才又根据老工人们的意见，在工厂党支部领导和鼓励下，将这台轧钢机重新加以整理提高，正式投入生产。
    经过一段正式生产，证明这种土法轧钢机的质量良好，生产的各种规格的钢材粗细都很均匀，没有蜂窝眼，耐拉力、压力都合乎要求。目前，这个厂的锻工车间绝大多数工人都已经掌握了这种轧钢机的操作技术。
