Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 1st: Ten counties and cities in Henan Province, including Xia邑, Meng County, Xiangcheng, Lushan, Xichuan, Yanshi, Yan师 County, Xiping, Bo'ai, and Shangqiu City, which achieved an average wheat yield of over 500 jin per mu this year, have recently formulated even more ambitious targets for next year's wheat production, striving to achieve an average wheat yield of 3,000 to 8,000 jin per mu respectively next year.

    To ensure the realization of the wheat production leap forward targets, these counties have first concentrated their efforts on grasping the crucial link of wheat sowing, focusing on deep plowing, increasing base fertilizer application, and using high-quality seeds with close planting. The wheat sowing work has now been basically completed. The 5.6 million mu of wheat land in the ten counties have generally been deep plowed to a depth of one chi or more before sowing. Some high-yield fields have been deep plowed to six chi, eight chi, or even one zhang or more. Combined with deep plowing, base fertilizer has been applied in layers. Xia邑 County applied the most fertilizer, with an average of over 230,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu to the county's 1.05 million mu of wheat fields. Xiangcheng County applied an average of 300,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu to its 150,000 mu of "satellite" fields, with some applying as much as 1 million jin. Various regions have generally adopted high-quality wheat varieties such as "Bi Ma No. 1" and "Bai Yu Pi," and have carried out seed dressing with pesticides and warm water soaking to prevent and control diseases and insect pests. Various regions have generally implemented close planting based on soil fertility, with a general sowing rate of over 30 to 35 jin. Combined with deep plowing, the land has also been leveled and ridged, realizing the ridging of wheat fields, creating favorable conditions for timely irrigation in the future.

    Currently, most of the wheat seedlings in these counties have emerged from the soil, and some have grown to two or three cun in height, looking tender and lovely. Party committees in various regions are earnestly leading the masses to conduct in-depth inspections and evaluations of the quality of wheat sowing, and have formulated specific measures to strengthen seedling management in response to the problems discovered. Among them, the common measures mainly include the following: (1) In conjunction with the Communist education movement, conduct in-depth mass airing of views, big contending, and big debate to make the goals, measures, and significance of striving for a greater leap forward in wheat production next year truly known to every household, mobilizing everyone to use their brains and offer suggestions. (2) Establish specialized institutions to earnestly do a good job in wheat field management. For example, the Meng County Party Committee established a Wheat Production Increase Command, and each commune established a wheat field management professional team, implementing fixed team areas, fixed group plots, and fixed individual ridges, contracting from sowing to harvesting, and each production link must be carefully inspected and accepted. (3) Vigorously develop "satellite" fields and "satellite" command fields. For example, Yan师 County, with a population of 530,000, has basically achieved an average of one mu of "satellite" field per person, and each commune has also established 3,000 mu of "satellite" command fields to guide and drive the production of "satellite" fields. (4) Vigorously implement technical measures. At present, special attention should be paid to doing a good job in checking seedlings and replanting in wheat fields, so that all wheat fields can have "not a single seedling missing." And vigorously engage in accumulating fertilizer to prepare sufficient topdressing fertilizer for wheat. In addition, there are irrigation, harrowing, weeding, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests.

### 今年小麦大增产  明年更要翻几番  河南十个县大展宏图  平均亩产将分别达到三千斤到八千斤

    今年小麦大增产  明年更要翻几番
    河南十个县大展宏图
    平均亩产将分别达到三千斤到八千斤
    新华社郑州1日电　今年获得小麦平均亩产五百多斤的河南省夏邑、孟县、襄城、鲁山、淅川、偃师、?县、西平、博爱、商丘市等十个县市，最近又满怀信心地制订出了明年小麦更大跃进的指标，力争明年小麦平均亩产分别达到三千斤到八千斤。
    为了保证实现小麦生产跃进指标，这些县都首先集中力量抓好以深翻土地、增施底肥和良种密植为中心的小麦播种这个环节。现在小麦播种工作已经基本结束。十个县的五百六十多万亩麦地，在播种前普遍深翻一尺以上。有些高额丰产田深翻更达到六尺、八尺，甚至一丈以上。结合深翻，又普遍进行分层施基肥。施肥最多的是夏邑县，全县一百零五万亩麦田，平均每亩施入底肥二十三万多斤。襄城县的十五万亩“卫星”田，平均每亩施底肥三十万斤，有的施到一百万斤。各地普遍采用“碧蚂一号”、“白玉皮”等优良小麦品种，进行了药剂拌种和温汤浸种等防治病虫害的处理。各地根据地力普遍进行密植，一般下种量都在三十斤到三十五斤以上。结合深翻，又普遍平地整畦，实现麦地畦田化，为今后适时灌溉创造了有利条件。
    目前，这些县的大部分麦苗已经出土，有的已经长到两三寸高，嫩绿可爱。各地党委都认真领导群众深入检查评比麦播工作质量，针对发现的问题，订出认真加强幼苗管理的具体措施。其中，带有共同性的措施主要有以下几种：（一）结合共产主义教育运动，深入展开大鸣大放大辩论，使明年小麦生产争取更大跃进的指标、措施和意义，真正家喻户晓，发动大家人人动脑筋，个个献计策。（二）建立专门机构，认真做好麦田管理工作。例如中共孟县县委成立小麦增产指挥部，各公社建立麦田管理专业队，实行队固定区，组固定块，人固定畦，从种到收包干到底，每个生产环节都要认真进行验收。（三）大搞“卫星”田和“卫星”指挥田。例如?县全县五十三万人，基本做到平均每人一亩“卫星”田，各公社还建立三千亩“卫星”指挥田，用来指挥与带动“卫星”田的生产。（四）大抓技术措施。当前特别注意做好麦田的查苗补种工作，使所有麦田都能“一苗不缺”。并且大抓积肥，为小麦准备充足的追肥。此外还有灌溉、耙耱、拔草、防治病虫害等。
