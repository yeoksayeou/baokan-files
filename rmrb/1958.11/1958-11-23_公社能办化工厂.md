Communes Can Run Chemical Factories
Fang Shuyuan, Deputy Director of Shangzhuang People's Commune Comprehensive Chemical Factory, Xushui County

Our factory started construction on August 27th this year, and after more than two months, it has now been basically completed. The factory has ten workshops, including starch, glucose, alcohol, synthetic rubber, synthetic ammonia, coal dry distillation, organic synthesis, pesticides, caustic soda, and sulfuric acid, producing more than 30 kinds of products. The factory has invested more than 300,000 yuan. The total annual output value is about 3.5 million yuan. After deducting costs and taxes, the annual profit can reach about 600,000 yuan, and all investment can be recovered in about half a year.

The products of our factory are mainly determined based on the following principles: First, to serve agricultural production and gradually realize agricultural chemization; second, to adapt to local conditions based on the needs and resource conditions of the commune; third, to implement diversified operations and comprehensive utilization of resources. All products are roughly divided into four categories.

The first category is based on the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products. Among them, the main products are butanol, acetone, alcohol, and starch made from sweet potatoes, and then glucose and syrup made from starch, and synthetic rubber made from alcohol. Synthetic rubber is then used to make various products such as rubber tubes, rubber bands, and rubber shoes. We also use corn cobs as raw materials to produce furfural and furfuryl alcohol; and castor oil as raw material to produce sebacic acid. Furfural can be made into plastics, synthetic fibers, fungicides, etc., furfuryl alcohol can be used as adhesives, and sebacic acid can be made into nylon.

The second category is to serve agricultural production. One is chemical fertilizer, synthetic ammonia, which can produce 150 tons per year. Using it as fertilizer can increase grain production by about 4.8 million catties. The other is pesticides, of which naphthalene acetic acid can stimulate the growth of crops; Trichlorfon is an insecticide; calcium chlorate is a herbicide and fumigant. There is also a fattening powder that can increase the weight of pigs after they eat it.

The third category is basic chemical products, mainly sulfuric acid and caustic soda. These are necessary raw materials for the development of iron and steel, smelting, textile, and papermaking industries. The supply of these two products is currently relatively tight. After we produce them ourselves, we can guarantee the needs of our county for the production of the above-mentioned products.

The fourth category is the comprehensive utilization of coal. We use low-temperature coal heap dry distillation to obtain coal tar and semi-coke. Semi-coke can be used as fuel, and heavy diesel and light diesel can be extracted from coal tar for use as fuel for tractors and diesel engines.

There were many difficulties in the construction process. First, we had no experience in running industry, second, we lacked equipment and materials, and third, labor was tight. However, difficulties cannot scare us from developing the chemical industry. As long as the masses are mobilized, anything can be done. Especially after the establishment of the People's Commune, there are more people and greater strength. The fact is indeed so. For example, our factory was built at the same time as the central tasks of autumn harvesting and wheat planting, and the vigorous development of steelmaking. At that time, the county required a three-day blitz to plant 30,000 mu of wheat, transport 60 tons of iron, and transport 2 million bricks to the city from the commune to support the steel industry. In this case, labor was already very tight, and bricks, tiles, and wood could no longer be transported to the chemical factory site. However, after everyone discussed it, they believed that delaying the autumn harvest would cause the grain to fall off and waste; planting wheat beyond the season would result in a large reduction in production next year; the steel marshal's ascendance to power was even more important; and the construction of the chemical factory also needed to be accelerated. So everyone automatically proposed to harvest and plant in autumn during the day, and collect civil engineering materials (including bricks, tiles, wood, large vats, large pots, bottles, cans, etc.) to transport to the chemical factory site at night. If there were not enough carts, they would carry them on their shoulders and backs. Those who participated in sending bricks included white-haired old people, twelve- or thirteen-year-old Young Pioneers, and middle-aged women holding children in one hand and bricks in the other. Those who were far away had to transport bricks from more than ten li away. The most bricks transported in one night reached 130,000. Those who had never built a factory and did not understand blueprints learned and worked at the same time. Grandpa Shang, an old tiler in the Happiness Home who was over sixty years old, automatically ran to help lay bricks when he heard that there were not enough tilers.

The source of civil engineering materials was also difficult. The factory needed 1.5 million bricks, but the commune only had 240,000 new bricks. If the shortfall was purchased externally, it would not only cost more money, but also the time would not be met. After the masses learned about this situation, they took the initiative to send their accumulated old bricks and half bricks to the construction site. Some commune members also automatically donated the bricks and wood they had prepared to build houses. Some also sent the old bricks that were removed during the relocation of graves to the construction site. Because the materials were hard-won, the slogan on the construction site was: "Use old bricks if there are no new bricks, use broken bricks if there are no whole bricks." More than 80% of the materials used for the construction of the factory were old materials. The building materials and sundry goods that we asked for support from various villages were generally delivered in advance, and the quantity often exceeded. Some building materials are difficult to buy on the market. As soon as we discover them and explain that the chemical factory needs them, no matter how valuable they are, the commune members are happy to donate them.

In terms of production equipment, we also try to obtain materials locally. We use nearly 400 large vats as reaction tanks, condensers, absorption towers, sedimentation tanks, high-level tanks, and so on. These equipments are generally made of steel and cement in large factories. On September 17, when more than ten Soviet experts came to visit our factory, they said: "The equipment looks very simple, but the products are just as good. This is creativity."

At present, our factory has 297 workers, most of whom are high school graduates transferred from various villages in our commune. The youngest of them are only fourteen or fifteen years old, and the oldest are only twenty-two or three years old. These workers are very unfamiliar with the chemical industry. We adopted the method of "building the factory, laboring, learning, and producing at the same time." After a short period of two months of training, most of the workers' technical test scores were above four points. For example, more than a dozen workers in the pesticide workshop were able to drive and produce on their own after only two weeks of classroom training and trial production internships.

These workers have all established the idea of ​​taking the factory as their home, thinking about the factory everywhere, and actively trying to find solutions when encountering difficulties. For example, winter has arrived, and the weather is getting colder day by day. The construction site does not have winter dormitories and cold protection equipment. They proactively proposed to build dormitories by themselves in their spare time. After two days of hard work, they built a cellar of more than 1,000 square meters next to the construction site that could accommodate more than 500 people. This kind of cellar is like a large pit in a room, covered with sorghum stalks on top, which is warm in winter and cool in summer. Without fire in winter, the temperature is about ten degrees Celsius. This not only solved the accommodation and winter heating problems for all employees, but also saved a lot of materials and expenses.

The cadres who manage our factory are like the workers. They are neither experts nor engineers. They were all transferred from various villages in the early stage of the factory construction. Some are company commanders, and some are party branch secretaries. At the beginning, everyone had varying degrees of fear of the chemical industry. They believed that running a chemical factory required a high level of education, and you had to understand foreign languages and molecular formulas. Peasants could not do this line of work at all. Therefore, some cadres wanted to change careers, wanted to jump lines, and asked to return to the village to engage in agriculture, etc. After the Party branch discovered this problem, it immediately explained through general discussions and small meetings that the chemical industry was not mysterious, and that as long as we broke superstitions, liberated our minds, dared to think and dared to act, we could completely master it. It also thoroughly broke the mysterious theory that the chemical industry was unattainable by using the example of the fourteen- or fifteen-year-old Young Pioneers being able to operate production after two weeks of study, and established the determination and confidence to run the chemical industry well. All cadres have made learning plans to strive to fully master production technology and business management work in the shortest possible time. Some people proposed to strive to reach the level of engineers within three years.

Through this period of factory construction and trial production work, we deeply realized that the People's Commune is fully capable of running the chemical industry. In our era, there is nothing that cannot be done. You don't understand foreign languages, and you don't understand molecular formulas, but you can still run a chemical factory and produce first-class chemical products.

Our first phase of factory construction will be completed recently, and it is expected that most of the products can be put into production by the end of November. On this basis, we plan to add a machine repair workshop, an explosives workshop, a small laboratory, a small water plant, etc. In this way, a small basic system of the chemical industry can be formed in our commune. With the gradual development of production, we will also build office buildings, staff dormitories, sports fields, etc. In addition, we will also set up a chemical technology school in the factory to implement part-work and part-study to cultivate rural chemical technology talents who are both red and expert.

    公社能办化工厂
    徐水县商庄人民公社综合化学工厂副厂长　房树元
    我们这个厂在今年8月27日开始建设，历经二个多月的时间，现在已经基本上建成了。全厂计有淀粉、葡萄糖、酒精、综合橡胶、合成氨、煤成堆干馏、有机合成、农药、烧?和硫酸等十个车间，共出产品三十多种。工厂共投资三十多万元。每年总产值约三百五十万元，扣除成本和税收，每年可得利润约六十万元，半年左右即可收回全部投资。
    我们厂的产品，主要是根据以下几项原则来确定的：一、为农业生产服务，逐步实现农业化学化；二、根据公社的需要和资源条件，因地制宜；三、实行多种经营，综合利用资源。全部产品大体分为四类。
    第一类是以综合利用农副产品为基础的。其中主要是用红薯制成丁醇、丙铜、酒精、淀粉，再用淀粉做成葡萄糖和糖浆，用酒精做成合成橡胶，用合成橡胶再做胶管、胶带、胶鞋等多种多样的产品。我们还用玉米芯作原料制造糠醛、糠醇；用蓖麻油作原料制造癸二酸。糠醛做成塑料、合成纤维、杀菌剂等，糠醇可以做胶合剂，癸二酸可以做成尼龙。
    第二类是为农业生产服务的。一种是化学肥料合成氨，全年可生产一百五十吨。用它来施肥，可以增产粮食四百八十万斤左右。另一种是农药，其中萘乙酸可以刺激农作物的生长；敌百虫是杀虫剂；氯酸钙是除草剂和熏蒸剂。还有一种肥猪粉，猪吃了以后可以增加体重。
    第三类是基本化学产品，主要是硫酸和烧?。它是发展钢铁、冶炼、纺织、造纸等工业必需的原料。这两种产品目前的供应都比较紧张，我们自己生产以后，就可以保证我县生产上述各种产品的需要。
    第四类是煤的综合利用。我们把原煤用低温成堆干馏方法，取得煤焦油和半焦。半焦可以做燃料，从煤焦油中可以提炼出重柴油和轻柴油，用作拖拉机和柴油机的燃料。
    在建厂过程中困难是不少的。一来我们没有办工业的经验，二来缺乏设备和材料，第三是劳动力紧张。但是，困难吓不倒我们兴办化学工业。只要发动了群众，什么事情都可以办到。特别是人民公社成立以后，人多了，力量也更大了。事实也确实是如此。例如，我们工厂是在秋收种麦、大搞钢铁等项中心工作的同时筹建的，当时县里要求在三天内突击种麦三万亩，运铁六十吨，同时为了支援钢铁工业，还要从社里运送二百万块砖进城。在这种情况下，劳动力已经很紧张，不能再往化工厂工地运送砖瓦和木材了。但是，经大家一讨论，认为秋收迟了粒籽脱落，要糟踏粮食；种麦超过季节明年要大量减产；钢铁元帅升帐更为重要；而建设化工厂也需要快马加鞭。于是大家自动提出，白天秋收秋种，晚上搜集土建材料（包括砖、瓦、木材、大缸、大锅、瓶瓶、罐罐等）往化工厂工地运送。车不够，就肩挑背背。参加送砖的人有白发苍苍的老人；有十二、三岁的红领巾；有中年妇女一手抱着孩子、一手抱砖；路远的要从十华里以外运来。运砖最多时一夜即达十三万块。没有盖过厂房不懂图纸，就一边学、一边干。幸福院六十多岁的老瓦工尚老大爷，听说瓦工人手不够，就自动跑来帮助砌砖。
    土建材料的来源也是有困难的，建厂需用砖一百五十万块，而公社仅有二十四万块新砖。不足部分如果外购，不仅花钱较多，时间也赶不上。群众知道这个情况以后，就主动地把自己积存的旧砖、半截砖送到工地。有的社员把准备盖房的砖和木材也都自动的献了出来。有的把迁墓时拆下来的旧砖也送到工地。因为材料来之不易，工地上的口号是：“没有新砖用旧砖，没有整砖用碎砖”。建厂所用材料80％以上是旧物旧料。我们请各村支援的建筑材料和什物，一般都是提前送到，而且数量往往超过。有些建筑材料在市场上很难买到，只要我们一旦发现，说明化工厂需用，不论价值多大，社员们都乐意把它献出来。
    在生产设备方面，我们也尽量就地取材。我们用近四百口大缸，作反应罐、冷凝器、吸收塔、沉淀槽、高位槽等等。这些设备在一般大厂中都是用钢材和水泥的。9月17日有十多位苏联专家来我厂参观时说：“设备看起来很简陋，但产品一样的好，这就是创造性。”
    目前我们全厂有工人二百九十七名，大都是从本社各村抽调来的高小毕业生。他们的年龄小的才十四、五岁，大的不过二十二、三岁。这些工人对化学工业是很陌生的。我们采取“边建厂，边劳动，边学习，边生产”的办法，经过短短两个月的培训，绝大部分工人的技术测验成绩都在四分以上。例如农药车间十多个工人，仅经过二个星期的课堂训练和试生产实习，现在就已能够自己开车生产。
    这些工人都树立了以厂为家的思想，处处为工厂着想，遇到困难就积极主动地想办法解决。比如冬季已到，天气一天要比一天冷了，工地没有过冬的宿舍和防寒设备，他们主动提出要在业余时间内自己造宿舍。经过两天的苦干，他们在工地旁边建起了一千多平方公尺能容纳五百多人的地窨子。这种地窨子类似房间的大坑，上边用高粱秸盖上，冬暖夏凉，冬天不生火，温度在摄氏十度左右。这样不但解决了全厂职工的住宿和冬季烤火问题，并且节省了不少的材料和费用。
    我们管理工厂的干部跟工人一样，既不是专家，又不是工程师，都是在建厂初期从各村庄抽调来的。有的是营长，有的是党支部书记。开始大家对化学工业都存有程度不同的畏难情绪。认为搞化工厂必须有很高的文化水平，要懂外国文、分子式，庄稼汉根本干不了这一行。因此，有的干部想转业，想跳行，要求回村搞农业去等等。党支部发觉这一问题后，立即通过大会讨论，小会讲解，说明化学工业并不神秘，只要破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢干，我们完全能够掌握它。又以十四、五岁的红领巾经过二星期的学习即能够操作生产的实例，彻底破除了化学工业高不可攀的神秘论，树立了办好化学工业的决心和信心。全体干部都订出了学习规划，争取在最短时间内能够全面掌握生产技术和经营管理工作。有的人提出，争取三年内达到工程师的水平。
    通过这一段的建厂和试生产工作，我们深深地体会到人民公社是完全能够办化学工业的。在我们这个时代里，没有什么不可以办的事情。不懂外国文，不懂分子式，也可以办化工厂，也可以生产出头等的化工产品来。
    我们第一期的建厂任务，最近即可完成，预计在11月底绝大部分产品可以投入生产。在这个基础上，我们计划还要增添机修车间、炸药车间、小型化验室、小型自来水厂等等，这样，在我们公社内，就可以形成一个小小的化学工业的基本体系。随着生产的逐步发展，我们还将建设办公楼、职工宿舍、运动场等。此外，我们还要在工厂里兴办一所化工技术学校，实行半工半读，培养又红又专的农村化工技术人才。（附图片）
