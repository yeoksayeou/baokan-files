    It's More Important That You Deliver the Ore
    Wen Zhi
    One afternoon, I was delivering ore to the Jimo Iron Plant with a small truck convoy when a tire suddenly went flat about twenty miles from Jimo. I thought it was a problem with the valve stem, so I shouted to my comrades in front to leave the air pump behind. But after pumping for a long time, I couldn't get any air in. I unscrewed the valve stem and took a look, and my head immediately buzzed—the rubber tube on the valve stem was broken.
    That was terrible. I didn't have a spare, the people in front had gone far ahead, and I didn't know when the people behind would arrive. There wasn't a village nearby, and I was really frustrated. Losing the competition didn't matter, but the blast furnace was open-mouthed and hungry for ore! I was worrying about the six hundred pounds of ore when a lieutenant military officer came riding a bicycle. I thought, I'm saved. He might have a spare rubber tube. I quickly waved and greeted him, and after he got off his bike, I told him the situation. He took the tube and looked at it. It was indeed unusable. He asked with concern, "Where are you pushing it to?" I said Jimo. "Oh, that's still far!" he said, looking at his watch. He bent down, let the air out of his bike's front tire, pulled out the tube, and handed it to me, saying, "Try this!" At that moment, I really didn't know what to say. I took it, put it on, and started pumping. I didn't even ask if he had a spare tube.
    When I straightened up, ready to pump up his bike's tire, ah! He was pushing his flat-tired bike away. I was really worried when I saw this. I rushed after him and said, "Comrade, this won't do! You…," I was so anxious that I couldn't say a word. The military officer smiled and said, "It's more important that you deliver the ore!" At that moment, I was so moved that I shed tears. I stood there blankly, watching him walk away, and then I remembered that I had forgotten to ask his name.

    还是你送矿石要紧
    文志
    一天下午，我跟小车队一起给即墨铁厂送矿石，走到离即墨还有二十里地时，小车突然跑了气。当时我以为气门咀有了毛病，就?呼着前面的伙伴把气筒留下，结果打了半天，进不去半点气。我把气门咀旋下一看，脑袋立刻嗡的一下，原来气门咀的胶管坏了。
    真糟透了，我没带预备的，前面的人又走远了，后面的不知什么时候才到，附近又没村子，心里很窝火。竞赛输了不要紧，炼铁炉张着咀要吃啊！我看着那六百斤矿石正发愁，迎面来了一位骑自行车的少尉军官，我想，有救了。他可能带着预备胶管。我连忙打招呼，等他下车后，我就把情况对他讲了一遍。他把胶管接过去看看，确实不能用了，就关心地问：“推到哪？”我说即墨。“哟，还很远哪！”他说着看了看手表，弯下腰把他车子的前轮放了气，拔出里面的胶管交给我说：“试试看吧！”当时我真不知道说什么好，接过来按上就打起气来。也没有问他有没有预备胶管。
    当我直起腰来准备给他的车子打气时，啊！他却推着没气的车子走了。我一看真着急了，追上去说：“同志，这那能行！你……，”我急得一句话说不出。那位军官笑笑说：“还是你送矿石要紧！”当时我被感动得掉了泪，呆呆地站在那里，看着他走远了，才想起忘了问问他的名字。
