According to the Liberation Daily news, following the commissioning of thirteen newly built and expanded steelmaking workshops with an annual output of 2.6 million tons of steel, and the soaring steel production, Shanghai is actively building a new batch of modern steel rolling workshops in order to quickly turn a large number of steel ingots into various steel products for construction. This batch of steel rolling workshops is very large in scale, including the No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants, each with a blooming mill workshop with a building area of about 10,000 square meters and an annual output of 400,000 to 500,000 tons, the No. 3 Steel Plant's medium plate workshop with an annual output of 200,000 tons, and the thin plate workshop with an annual output of 67,000 tons, and the No. 1 Steel Plant's seamless steel pipe workshop with an annual output of 50,000 tons. After this batch of workshops is put into production at the end of this year and the beginning of next year, on the one hand, it will change the imbalance between the rapid growth of Shanghai's steelmaking equipment and the inadequate original steel rolling capacity, and on the other hand, most of the various steel products needed by Shanghai's electromechanical industry, shipbuilding industry, and construction industry can be self-sufficient.

Currently, the hoisting of the main buildings of the blooming mill workshop of No. 1 Steel Plant and the medium plate workshop of No. 3 Steel Plant has been completed, and the foundation projects of these two workshops have also been basically completed, and they may be put into production successively this month.

(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 14th) In order to meet the needs of the mass movement to develop the steel industry, Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant in Henan Province and other plants are actively producing steel rolling mills. So far, Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant has produced 16 steel rolling mills, each of which can roll more than 50 tons of steel per day, for supply to some machinery manufacturing plants. Other machinery plants, such as Zhengzhou Machinery Plant, Xinxiang Weixin Machinery Plant, and Anyang Universal Machinery Plant, have manufactured a batch of small steel rolling mills themselves, taking the road of arming themselves, in the current situation where the supply of "foreign" steel rolling equipment cannot keep up.

This year, Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant plans to produce a total of 25 steel rolling mills. These steel rolling mills can produce 1.08 million tons of various steel products annually. This factory did not originally produce steel rolling mills. When it accepted the task of manufacturing steel rolling mills assigned to them by the province in July this year, there were no drawings, and in particular, large-scale and heat treatment equipment had not been installed, making it very difficult to manufacture steel rolling mills. However, in addition to sending people to Beijing, Anshan, and Taiyuan to purchase materials, collect drawings, and learn technology, they also launched a shock equipment installation campaign. The workers broke the routine of life and moved to live in offices and workshops. The factory director and party secretary also fought day and night in the workshop. Red flag competitions were also launched between the workshops, creating and transforming 215 kinds of tools, which greatly accelerated the manufacturing speed of steel rolling mills.

In order to meet their own steel rolling needs, many small machinery plants did not sit and wait for "foreign" and "large" steel rolling mills, but tried every possible means to manufacture indigenous and small steel rolling mills to solve urgent needs. For example, Zhengzhou Machinery Plant, although relevant departments in Henan Province have allocated a steel rolling mill manufactured by Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant to them, this does not meet their needs. Recently, they manufactured a small steel rolling mill themselves. With the specific help of teachers and students from Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology and Tsinghua University who came to Henan Province to help, Xinxiang Weixin Machinery Plant, after three days and nights of hard work, manufactured a half-ton indigenous steel rolling mill, which can roll more than two tons of round steel, square steel, and rebar every day; if the rolls are replaced, it can also roll one-centimeter-thick plates. Anyang Universal Machinery Plant recently manufactured a seamless steel pipe rolling mill themselves. When manufacturing this machine, there was no large steel, so they used the steel castings they produced themselves to replace them; there was no boring machine for processing large parts, so they collected waste materials from various sources and modified a machine.

    上海加紧新建一批轧钢车间  河南大造轧钢设备武装自己
    据解放日报消息　继新建、扩建的年产二百六十万吨钢的十三个炼钢车间投入生产，钢产量飞跃上升以后，为了使大量钢锭迅速变成建设上的各种钢材，上海市又积极兴建一批新型的轧钢车间。这一批轧钢车间规模很大，计有建筑面积达一万平方公尺左右、年产量四十万吨到五十万吨的上钢一厂和三厂的两座开坯车间，年产二十万吨中板和年产六万七千吨薄板的上钢三厂中板、薄板车间，年产五万吨无缝钢管的上钢一厂无缝钢管车间。这一批车间在今年年底和明年年初投入生产后，一方面将改变上海市炼钢设备飞速增长和原有轧钢能力不相适应的不平衡状况，另一方面，上海市机电工业、造船工业、建筑工业所需要的各种钢材，大部分可以自给自足。
    目前，上钢一厂的开坯车间和三厂的中板车间高大的主厂房的吊装工程已经完成，这两个车间的基础工程也已基本结束，有可能在本月份先后投入生产。
    本报郑州14日电　河南洛阳矿山机械厂等，为了适应全民大办钢铁的需要，积极生产轧钢机。到目前为止，洛阳矿山机械厂已经生产出每台每天可轧五十多吨钢材的轧钢机十六台，供应一些机械制造厂使用。而另外一些机械厂，如郑州机械厂、新乡维新机械厂和安阳通用机械厂等单位，在目前洋的轧钢设备供应不上的情况下，它们自制了一批小型轧钢机，走自己武装自己的道路。
    今年洛阳矿山机械厂计划共生产轧钢机二十五台。这些轧钢机可年产各种钢材一百零八万吨。这个工厂原来并不生产轧钢机。今年7月间接受了省里分配给他们制造轧钢机的任务时，没有图纸，特别是大型的和热处理设备都没有安装起来，要制造轧钢机困难很多。但他们除了派人到北京、鞍山、太原采购材料，收集图纸，学习技术外，还开展了一个突击安装设备的运动。职工们打破了生活常规，纷纷搬到办公室、车间里去住。厂长、党委书记也和工人日夜战斗在车间。各个车间之间还开展了红旗竞赛，创造和改造了二百一十五种工具，大大加快了轧钢机的制造速度。
    为了满足自己的轧钢需要，许多小机械厂，不是坐等“洋”的“大”的轧钢机，而是千方百计制造土的小型的轧钢机，来解决急需。如郑州机械厂，河南省有关部门虽已把洛阳矿山机械厂制造出来的轧钢机分配了一台给他们，但这并不能满足他们的需要。最近他们就自制了一台小型轧钢机。新乡维新机械厂在来河南省帮助工作的北京钢铁学院和清华大学师生具体帮助下，经过三昼夜的苦战，制成了半吨重土轧钢机，每天能压元钢或方钢、钢筋两吨多；如果调换一下轧辊，还可轧一厘米的薄板。安阳通用机械厂最近自制了一部无缝钢管轧机。在制造这部机器的时候，没有大型钢材，他们就以自己生产出的钢浇铸钢件来代替；没有加工大部件的镗床，便多方收集废料改制了一台。（附图片）
