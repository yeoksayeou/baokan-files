Selected New Folk Songs

　　Singing Makes Tea Oil More Than Water

　　Picking tea seeds, singing songs,
　　Treasures fill the baskets all over the mountains,
　　One basket of tea seeds, one basket of songs,
　　Singing makes tea oil more than water.
　　　　　　——Peng Fahai

　　Bumping Heads Uphill and Downhill

　　A bumper harvest year, many tea seeds,
　　Bumping heads uphill and downhill,
　　Picking the seeds and pressing them into oil, sailing boats don't need to go down the big river.
　　　　　　——Zhang Wenqing

　　Picking a Tung Seed as Big as a Peck

　　Haven't sung for a long time, singing spirit aroused,
　　Singing together to pick tung and tea,
　　Picking a tung seed as big as a peck,
　　Picking a tea seed bigger than a watermelon,
　　Everyone wants to collect them,
　　Every seed must be returned home,
　　Pressing oil to support industrialization.
　　　　——Xinning Heping Commune

    唱得茶油比水多
    手摘茶籽口唱歌，
    遍山珠宝进谷箩，
    茶籽一箩歌一箩，
    唱得茶油比水多。
            ——彭发海
    上山下岭碰脑壳
    丰收年成茶子多，
    上山下岭碰脑壳，
    摘下子来榨成油，行船不用下大河。
            ——张文清
    摘个桐子有斗大久没唱歌歌性发，唱过齐把桐茶摘，摘个桐子有斗大，摘个茶子赛西瓜，个个要收回，颗颗要还家，榨油支援工业化。
  ——新宁和平公社
