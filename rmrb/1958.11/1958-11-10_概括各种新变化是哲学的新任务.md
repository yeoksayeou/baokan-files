Summarizing Various New Changes is the New Task of Philosophy
Pan Zinian

In 1842, Marx said: Our philosophy must become the philosophy of the world, and the world will become the world of philosophy. Marx's words are currently being realized in China. Thanks to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and thanks to Mao Zedong's works, which provide a model for combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's revolutionary practice, Marxism-Leninism philosophy, once it entered China, gave the Chinese people's revolutionary cause a new look and began the process of the Sinicization of Marxism-Leninism philosophy and the Marxist-Leninist philosophization of China. The successive victories of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution and the Socialist Revolution, as well as the brilliant achievements of socialist construction, are the splendid flowers and rich fruits that this philosophy has produced in China. In the past year, under the Party's propaganda and organizational leadership, the mass movement of studying philosophy, applying philosophy, learning while doing, and using what they learn has been universally launched in factories, villages, troops, government agencies, and schools across the country, forming a surging torrent and presenting us with a beautiful picture of a hundred flowers blooming and vying for beauty: China is about to become a philosophical China.

A philosophical China requires a Sinicized philosophy. In this recent period, many cutting-edge sciences in China's natural sciences have made many inventions and creations, many of which have broken world records, requiring Chinese philosophy workers to promptly summarize these new achievements and give natural dialectics new content and new development. At the same time, China's social landscape is also changing rapidly, causing many fundamental changes in the entire social structure, the relationship between people, and people's ideological conditions, and various kinds of leaps are being set off in people's material and spiritual lives. These are all requiring Chinese philosophy workers to promptly summarize these new changes, study and solve the new problems posed by the new changes, and give historical materialism and dialectical logic new content and new development.

The leaping progress of socialist construction presents many problems for the Sinicization of philosophy, which urgently need us to study and solve. China is about to become a philosophical China, and philosophy must also have a Sinicized philosophy. This has already been placed on the agenda of philosophy workers.

    概括各种新变化是哲学的新任务
    潘梓年
    1842年，马克思曾说过这样的话：我们的哲学要成为世界的哲学，世界也将成为哲学的世界。马克思这句话目前正在中国实现着。由于有了中国共产党的领导，由于有了毛泽东著作那样的使马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国的革命实践相结合的典范，马克思列宁主义哲学一进入中国，就使中国人民的革命事业面目为之一新，就开始了马克思列宁主义哲学中国化和中国马克思列宁主义哲学化的过程。中国人民民主革命和社会主义革命的相继胜利，以及社会主义建设的辉煌成就，就是这个哲学在中国所开的灿烂之花，所结的丰硕之果。最近一年来，中国人民在党的宣传鼓动和组织领导下，学哲学、用哲学、边干边学、边学边用的群众性运动，已在全国工厂、农村、部队、机关、学校中普遍展开，形成一股奔腾澎湃的洪流，在我们面前展示出一幅百花齐放、争奇斗艳的美丽画图：中国即将成为哲学的中国。
    哲学的中国要求有中国化的哲学。最近这一时期，中国自然科学方面的许多尖端科学有了许多发明创造，其中有许多已打破了世界纪录，要求中国的哲学工作者及时总结这方面的新成就，使自然辩证法获得新的内容和新的发展。同时，中国的社会面貌也在日新月异，使整个社会结构、人与人的关系、人的思想状况起了许多根本性的变化，使人的物质生活和精神生活都在掀起各种各样的飞跃。这些都在要求中国的哲学工作者及时概括这种新变化，研究和解决新变化所提出的新问题，使历史唯物主义和辩证逻辑获得新的内容和新的发展。
    社会主义建设事业的飞跃前进对哲学中国化提出的问题是很多的，亟须我们去研究解决。中国将要成为哲学的中国，哲学也必须要有中国化的哲学，这已是提到哲学工作者的议事日程上来的事了。
