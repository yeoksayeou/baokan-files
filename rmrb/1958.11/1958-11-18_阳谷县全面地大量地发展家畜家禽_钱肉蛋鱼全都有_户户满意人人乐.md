Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 17th: Yanggu County, Shandong Province, has mobilized the broad masses to comprehensively launch a "Fifteen Rearing" campaign for raising livestock and poultry. This satisfies both the needs of large-scale agricultural production for various organic fertilizers and the needs of the people's ever-improving living standards for various meat and egg foods. This has promoted a joyful situation of "six more," "six haves," and "five satisfactions" in the countryside.

　　Yanggu County's mass movement of raising pigs, cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, sheep, chickens, geese, ducks, rabbits, fish, and medicinal materials such as scorpions and turtles—the "Fifteen Rearing"—began in April of this year. In just over six months, the number of various livestock and poultry in the county has exceeded any previous period in history. Hogs are the main project of this county's animal husbandry production. In the past, it had always remained around 160,000 head, but now it has jumped to 1,050,000 head, an average of 3.5 head per person. The number of sheep has jumped from the original 42,000 to over 158,000. Horses, rabbits, chickens, and bees have also increased from two to four times. Fish farming has increased a staggering thirty times. People have learned from practical life that after comprehensively and massively developing livestock and poultry, there is more fertilizer. It is estimated that the county can accumulate 450 billion jin of pen manure this year, an average of 500,000 jin per mu, an increase of eight times over last year. There are more materials to support the state. This year, the county sold a large number of live pigs, furs, and eggs to the state. Commune members have more income. Commune members can earn an average of 162 yuan per person from the development of livestock and poultry production. The total income of the People's Commune has increased, and more funds can be used for agricultural capital construction. Because there is more fertilizer for crops, the county's grain yield per mu reached more than 4,500 jin this year, an increase of more than nineteen times over last year. More people are participating in labor, and even the elderly in the happiness homes are participating in light labor such as feeding chickens, achieving that there is no idle person in any village. The "Fifteen Rearing" has also brought a well-off life with money to spend, meat to eat, eggs to eat, fish to eat, milk to drink, and honey to eat. In the past, the supply of meat and eggs here was tight; but now, the vast number of farmers can eat a certain amount of meat and eggs. In the past, women in confinement could not eat eggs; after the commune concentrated on raising chickens, every woman in confinement at the Yanlou Maternity Hospital could eat one hundred eggs. Therefore, the elderly, women in confinement, patients, the masses, and cadres are all satisfied.

　　The important significance of comprehensively and massively developing livestock and poultry was not recognized by everyone from the beginning. Some people had doubts and objections. Later, meetings and big-character posters were used to launch a free airing of views and debates among cadres and the masses. Through debates and detailed accounting, everyone realized that the county has a large number of sows and female livestock, which they can breed in large numbers; and that there are sufficient feed and other favorable conditions. In this way, everyone's enthusiasm was aroused, ensuring the healthy development of the movement.

　　Yanggu County has learned from this period of work that the implementation of public raising by the People's Commune is one of the prerequisites for massively developing livestock and poultry. After the commune concentrates on raising them, it can arrange them uniformly, develop them in a planned way, and carry out scientific management. At present, nearly 10,000 pig, cattle, chicken, rabbit, and bee farms have been established in the county. For the same type of livestock and poultry, they are housed and managed separately according to their size, fatness, and other conditions, and different feeding methods are adopted according to the different types of livestock and poultry.

　　In order to further carry out livestock and poultry raising in winter, the Yanggu County Party Committee recently held a special meeting to study how to break with conventions and vigorously breed livestock and poultry in winter while protecting the safe wintering of various livestock and poultry. In order to strengthen the feeding work, the county plans to currently transfer 20% of the labor force, led by the party branch secretary or commune director, to establish professional teams for various types of feeding; and immediately mobilize semi-laborers to collect feed in a concentrated effort, and heavily ensile and dry-store feed to ensure sufficient winter feed for livestock and poultry.

    阳谷县全面地大量地发展家畜家禽
    钱肉蛋鱼全都有　户户满意人人乐
    据新华社济南17日电　山东阳谷县发动广大群众全面展开饲养家畜、家禽的“十五养”运动，既满足农业大生产对各种有机质肥料的需要，又满足人民生活水平日益提高对各种肉蛋食品等的需要，促使农村出现了“六多”、“六有”、“五满意”的欢乐局面。
    阳谷县饲养猪、牛、马、驴、骡、羊、鸡、鹅、鸭、兔、鱼及药材蝎子、土鼋等“十五养”的群众运动，是从今年4月份开始的，到目前仅六个多月的时间，全县各种家畜、家禽的数量都超过历史上任何时期。生猪是这个县畜牧生产的主要项目，过去一直保持在十六万头左右，现在已经跃增到一百零五万头，平均每人达到三点五头；羊的数量从原来的四万二千多只，跃增到十五万八千多只；马、兔、鸡及蜂等，也跃增一倍到四倍；鱼的养殖量更猛增三十倍。人们从实际生活中体会到，全面地大量地发展家畜家禽以后，肥料多了。据估算，今年全县能积四千五百亿斤圈肥，平均每亩地五十万斤，比去年增长了八倍。支援国家的物资多了。今年全县卖给国家大批生猪、皮毛和蛋品。社员收入多了。社员从发展畜牧家禽的生产中，平均每人可得一百六十二元。人民公社的总收入增加了，可以用更多的资金进行农业基本建设。因为农作物肥料增多，今年全县粮食亩产量达到四千五百多斤，比去年增长十九倍多。参加劳动的人多了，幸福院的老人也都参加了喂鸡等轻微劳动，达到了村村无闲人。“十五养”也带来了有钱用、有肉吃、有蛋吃、有鱼吃、有奶吃、有蜂蜜吃的丰衣足食的生活。以往，这里的肉类、蛋品供应紧张；而现在，广大农民都能吃到一定数量的肉食和蛋品了。过去，产妇们吃不到鸡蛋；公社集中养鸡后，阎楼妇产院的每个产妇都可以吃到鸡蛋一百个。因此，老人、产妇、病人、群众、干部个个满意。
    全面地大量地发展家畜家禽的重要意义，并不是一开始就被所有的人认识到的。有些人曾抱怀疑和反对的态度。后来，在干部和群众中以会议和大字报的形式展开鸣放辩论。通过辩论和算细账，大家认识到全县有大量的母猪、母畜，自己可以大量繁育；有足够的饲料等有利条件。这样，就鼓起了大家的干劲，保证了运动的健康发展。
    阳谷县从这一时期的工作中得出经验：实行由人民公社公养是大量发展家畜家禽的先决条件之一。公社集中饲养后，就可以统一安排，有计划地发展，并且进行科学管理。现在，全县共建立了猪、牛、鸡、兔、蜂等饲养场近万个；对同一类畜禽，又按大小、肥瘦等情况分别居住管理，按照不同类型的畜禽，采取不同喂养方法。
    为了进一步开展冬季的畜禽饲养工作，中共阳谷县委于最近又召开专门会议，研究如何在保护好各种畜禽安全过冬的前提下，打破陈规，在冬季大力进行繁育畜禽工作。为了加强饲养工作，这个县计划目前抽调20％的劳动力，以党支部书记或社主任为首，建立起各种饲养的专业队伍；并立即发动半劳动力突击采集饲料，大量青贮、干贮饲料，以保证畜禽过冬饲料充足。
