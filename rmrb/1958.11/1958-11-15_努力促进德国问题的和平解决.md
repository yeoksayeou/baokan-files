    The Government of the German Democratic Republic issued on November 12 a memorandum on the threat to peace posed by the policy of arming West Germany and a white paper on the aggressive policy of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. These documents, with their irrefutable facts, sharply point out to the urgency and importance of a peaceful solution to the German question, and should be given great importance by all those who care about the security of the German people and the peoples of Europe, and care about international peace.
    Old Germany, controlled by monopoly capitalist groups and militarists, was once the hotbed of war that brought two huge disasters to hundreds of millions of people around the world. Naturally, after defeating Hitler's Germany, the primary desire of the people of all countries was to eradicate this hotbed of war. The Potsdam Agreement of August 1945 by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom solemnly declared, reflecting this desire of the people of all countries: "German militarism and Nazism shall be eradicated, and the Allies shall unanimously agree to take other necessary measures, at present or in the future, to ensure that Germany never again threatens its neighbors and world peace."
    Thirteen years have passed since the signing of the Potsdam Agreement. People are happy to see that this agreement has been fully implemented in the eastern territories of Germany. There, the German Democratic Republic, where the working people hold political power, under the correct leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, has forever buried monopoly capital and militarism, resolutely pursued a peaceful foreign policy, and become an active fighter for the widespread development of friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries, earning the infinite respect of all peace-loving people in the world. The path of the German Democratic Republic is the path of transforming from a hotbed of war to a pillar of peace.
    However, people cannot fail to notice that a different path is being taken in the western territories of Germany. There, the Potsdam Agreement has been brutally violated. For thirteen years, U.S. imperialism has deliberately transformed West Germany into a European shock force for instigating a new war, and has painstakingly supported the German monopoly capitalist groups and militarists who were defeated in the last war; at the same time, West German revanchists, headed by Adenauer, have attempted to use the ambitions of U.S. imperialism to realize their own plans for a comeback. Therefore, a situation that is seriously disturbing has formed in the current West Germany. The memorandum of the Government of the German Democratic Republic points out that West Germany's economic power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small number of monopoly capitalists, and the degree of concentration has exceeded the level of 1938, the year before Hitler launched World War II; West Germany's government agencies are filled with a large number of Nazis or people who supported the Nazi regime, many of whom hold decision-making positions. For example, eight of the current seventeen ministers in the West German government held important positions in the Hitler government or the Nazi Party. In a word, the German monopoly capitalist groups and militarists who launched the two world wars are now back in power. This regime internally deprives the people of their democratic rights and suppresses the workers' movement; externally, it actively implements a broad expansion plan to establish a "Greater Germanic Empire." It not only clamors for "eastward advance," attempting to annex the democratic fruits of the German people—the German Democratic Republic—but also strives to extend its influence to neighboring European countries. It attempts to undermine the Oder-Neisse boundary with Poland to annex Polish territory, it strives to rely on the support of the United States to pursue the position of overlord in Western Europe, and it also casts a long, covetous gaze towards the Middle East and Africa. The West German government is no longer satisfied with only accepting atomic weapons from the United States. Adenauer and his ilk have repeatedly clamored that West Germany has the right to manufacture atomic weapons, and in fact, they are already engaged in atomic weapons research. In order to realize the ambitions of "revanchism," the West German government has consistently opposed every action conducive to easing international tensions, closely following the chariot of U.S. imperialism and acting as its accomplice.
    This situation shows the urgency of a peaceful solution to the German question. People can see very clearly that if a divided Germany can be reunited on the basis of peace and democracy in accordance with the wishes of all the German people, it will make it impossible for imperialists to turn the German question into a source of international tension. In this regard, the proposal put forward by the German Democratic Republic on September 5 this year regarding the beginning of preparations for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is of great significance. Because, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany will fully restore the sovereignty of the German nation, will lead to the withdrawal of foreign troops from Germany, and will guarantee that the German people can accelerate the solution of the German unification issue without foreign interference. The governments of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany have successively rejected the German Democratic Republic's proposal of September 5. They insist on excluding the German people from having a say in the issue of national reunification, stubbornly advocating that a four-power conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France should arrange "free elections" to unify Germany. This attempt to disregard the German people's right to self-determination, disregard the existence of the German Democratic Republic, and vainly attempt to annex the German Democratic Republic under the guise of "free elections" by the West German regime, is of course impossible to solve the German question. However, the importance of the German Democratic Republic's proposal is not weakened by the unreasonable rejection of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany. The recent Soviet-Polish meeting statement expressed support for this proposal of the German Democratic Republic, believing that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany can greatly ease the tense situation in Europe. The memorandum and white paper issued by the Government of the German Democratic Republic this time on the policies of the West German government will certainly arouse people's serious concern about the peaceful settlement of the German question to a wider extent, thereby conducting a more resolute struggle for it.
    The proposal made by Soviet Premier Khrushchev on November 10 regarding ending the occupation status of Berlin and withdrawing foreign troops from Berlin has a major promoting effect on the struggle for a peaceful solution to the German question and easing the tense situation in Europe. As everyone knows, in the more than ten years that the United States, Britain, and France have occupied West Berlin in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and other relevant agreements, they have turned this part of the region, which is the capital of the German Democratic Republic, into a state within a state. They have used West Berlin to undermine the economic activities of the German Democratic Republic and to carry out political provocations against the German Democratic Republic. The "Berlin issue" of June 1948 and the Berlin riots of June 1953 were the consequences of this destructive and provocative action by imperialism. Therefore, ending the occupation status of Berlin and withdrawing foreign troops from Berlin means ending West Berlin's role as a center of the Cold War, a center of espionage, and a source of tension. Not only that, but the withdrawal of foreign troops from Berlin can also create a good start for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the whole of Germany, and the unification of Berlin can also promote peaceful understanding between the people of the two Germanys and increase the possibility of the German people themselves solving the issue of national reunification. Therefore, Khrushchev's proposal has been widely welcomed by the German people, who believe that this proposal is in line with the interests of the people of the whole of Germany and the whole of Europe, and is an important step towards guaranteeing peace in Germany and the whole of Europe.
    The U.S., British, and French imperialists are clamoring to maintain their "right" to station troops in West Berlin. However, this "right" of Western imperialism is very ridiculous. People cannot help but ask: After they have so blatantly violated the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the elimination of German militarism and Nazism, and made this agreement completely ineffective in West Germany, what right do they have to occupy West Berlin according to the Potsdam Agreement? Western imperialists also attempt to portray their stationing of troops in Berlin as if it were not stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement, but—as the British Foreign Office said—"an occupation right obtained due to Germany's unconditional surrender." This is a completely shameless trick of reversing black and white while disregarding historical facts.
    Obviously, due to the obstruction of the Western imperialist countries and the West German Adenauer government, the prospect of a peaceful solution to the German question is still fraught with difficulties. The threat currently posed by the rearmament of West Germany to European security and international peace is very serious. All peace-loving people cannot sit idly by and watch this situation develop. The Chinese people actively support the German Democratic Republic's proposal on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and actively support the Soviet government's proposal on ending the occupation status of Berlin and withdrawing foreign troops from Berlin. We believe that these proposals will play an increasingly important role and influence in promoting the struggle for a peaceful solution to the German question.

### 努力促进德国问题的和平解决

    努力促进德国问题的和平解决
    11月12日，德意志民主共和国政府发表了关于武装西德的政策造成对和平的威胁的备忘录和关于德意志联邦共和国政府的侵略政策的白皮书。这些文件以其无可辩驳的事实向人们尖锐地指出了和平解决德国问题的迫切性和重要性，应该引起一切关怀德国人民和欧洲各国人民的安全、关怀国际和平的人士的十分重视。
    在垄断资本集团和军国主义分子控制下的旧德国，曾经是给全世界亿万人民带来了两次巨大灾难的战争策源地。很自然的，各国人民在击败了希特勒德国之后，首要的愿望就是铲除这一战争策源地，1945年8月的苏美英三国波茨坦协定正是反映了各国人民的这一愿望而庄严地宣告：“德国之军国主义及纳粹主义将予根除，各盟国将一致同意于目前或未来采取其他保证使德国永远不再威胁其邻邦与世界和平之必要措施。”
    波茨坦协定签订后，于兹十有三年，人们庆幸地看到这一协定在德国的东部领土上得到了完全的实现。在那里，由劳动人民掌握政权的德意志民主共和国，在德国统一社会党的正确领导下，永远埋葬了垄断资本和军国主义，坚决奉行和平外交政策，成为广泛发展各国人民友好合作的积极战士，博得了世界上一切爱好和平的人民的无限尊敬。德意志民主共和国的道路是从战争温床转化为和平支柱的道路。
    但是，人们不能不同时注意到，在德国的西部领土上，走的却是另一条道路。在那里，波茨坦协定遭受了粗暴的破坏。十三年来，美帝国主义蓄意变西德为挑起新战争的一支欧洲突击队，精心扶植那些在上次大战中已被打垮了的德国垄断资本集团和军国主义分子；同时，以阿登纳为首的西德复仇主义分子企图利用美帝国主义的野心来实现他们自己的东山再起的计划。因此，在目前的西德已形成了令人严重不安的局面。德意志民主共和国政府的备忘录指出，西德的经济权力越来越集中于一小撮垄断资本家手中，其集中的程度已经超过1938年也就是希特勒发动第二次世界大战的前一年的水平；西德的政府机构充斥了大批纳粹分子或支持纳粹政权的人，其中不少人还居于决策地位，譬如目前西德政府的十七个部长中就有八人曾在希特勒政府或纳粹党担任过重要职务。一句话，过去发动了两次世界大战的德国垄断资本集团和军国主义分子，现在重新掌握了政权。这个政权对内剥夺人民的民主权利，镇压工人运动；对外积极执行一个广泛的扩张计划，以建立“大日耳曼帝国”。它不仅叫嚣“东进”，妄图吞并德意志人民的民主果实——德意志民主共和国，而且力图把自己的势力扩展到邻近的欧洲国家去。它企图破坏同波兰的奥得—尼斯分界线以兼并波兰的领土，它竭力依仗美国的支持而追求西欧的盟主地位，它还向着中东和非洲垂着一尺长的唾涎。西德政府已经不再满足于只从美国接受原子武器，阿登纳之流不止一次地叫嚣西德有制造原子武器的权利，而且实际上已经从事于原子武器的研究工作。为了实现“复仇主义”的野心，西德政府一贯反对每一项有利于缓和国际紧张局势的行动，紧紧追随于美帝国主义的战车之后，为虎作伥。
    这种情况显示了和平解决德国问题的迫切性。人们可以看得很清楚，如果分裂的德国能够按照全体德国人民的愿望在和平和民主的基础上重新统一，就可以使得帝国主义者不再能够把德国问题变成他们制造国际紧张局势的根源。在这方面，德意志民主共和国于今年9月5日提出的关于开始准备缔结对德和约的建议，具有巨大的意义。因为，缔结了对德和约，就会完全恢复德国民族的主权，就会导致外国军队撤出德国，就会保证德国人民在没有外力的干涉下加速德国统一问题的解决。美、英、法和西德政府已经先后拒绝了德意志民主共和国9月5日的建议。它们坚持要排斥德国人民在祖国统一的问题上的发言权，顽固地主张由苏美英法四大国高级会议来安排“自由选举”以统一德国。这种无视德国人民的自决权利、无视德意志民主共和国的存在、妄想在“自由选举”的美名下由西德政权并吞德意志民主共和国的企图，当然不可能解决德国问题。但是，德意志民主共和国的建议的重要性，并不因美、英、法和西德的无理拒绝而有所削弱。最近的苏联—波兰会谈声明表示支持德意志民主共和国的这一建议，认为缔结了对德和约能够在很大程度上缓和欧洲的紧张局势。德意志民主共和国政府这次就西德政府的政策问题而发表的备忘录和白皮书，肯定地将在更广泛的程度上引起人们对和平解决德国问题的严重关怀，从而为之进行更坚决的斗争。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫11月10日关于结束柏林的占领状态和从柏林撤退外国驻军的建议，对于和平解决德国问题、缓和欧洲紧张局势的斗争，有着重大的推进作用。众所周知，在美英法三国根据波茨坦协定和其他有关协议而占领西柏林的十多年中，已经把作为德意志民主共和国首都的这一部分地区变为国家中之国家。它们利用西柏林来破坏德意志民主共和国的经济活动，向德意志民主共和国进行政治挑衅。1948年6月的“柏林问题”和1953年6月的柏林骚乱，就是帝国主义这种破坏和挑衅行动的后果。因此，结束柏林的占领状态和从柏林撤退外国驻军，就意味着结束西柏林的成为冷战中心、间谍中心和紧张局势策源地的作用。不仅如此，从柏林撤退外国驻军还可以为从整个德国撤退外国驻军创造良好开端，柏林的统一也可以促进两个德国的人民之间的和平谅解，增加德国人民自己解决祖国统一问题的可能性。因此，鲁赫晓夫的建议受到德国人民的广泛欢迎，他们认为这个建议是符合全德国和全欧洲人民的利益的，是走向保障德国和整个欧洲的和平的重要一步。
    美、英、法帝国主义叫嚣要维护它们的在西柏林驻军的“权利”。可是，西方帝国主义的这种“权利”是非常可笑的。人们不禁要问：在他们这样肆无忌惮地破坏了波茨坦协定关于肃清德国军国主义和纳粹主义的规定，使这个协定在西德完全失去了作用之后，他们还有什么权利根据波茨坦协定来霸占西柏林呢？西方帝国主义还企图把他们驻军柏林说成是仿佛不是由波茨坦协定规定的，而是——像英国外交部所说的——“由于德国无条件投降而得到的占领权利”。这完全是不顾历史事实而颠倒黑白的耍赖手段。
    很明显，由于西方帝国主义国家和西德阿登纳政府的阻挠，和平解决德国问题的前途还困难重重。目前重新武装西德对欧洲安全和国际和平所造成的威胁是十分严重的。一切爱好和平的人民不能坐视这种局势发展下去。中国人民积极支持德意志民主共和国关于缔结对德和约的建议，积极支持苏联政府关于结束柏林的占领状态并从柏林撤退外国军队的建议。我们相信，这些建议对推动和平解决德国问题的斗争将发生日益重要的作用和影响。
