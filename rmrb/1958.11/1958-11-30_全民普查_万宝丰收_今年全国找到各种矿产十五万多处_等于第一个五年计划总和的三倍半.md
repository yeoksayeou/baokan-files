    National Census, Bumper Harvest
    This Year, the Nation Found Over 150,000 Mineral Deposits, Equal to Three and a Half Times the Total of the First Five-Year Plan
    (Our Newspaper reports) China's geological work has achieved unprecedented high-speed development this year, and mineral resources have experienced an unprecedented bumper harvest.

    Since the Party Central Committee put forward the general line for building socialism, the demand for mineral resources has been very urgent in various places. Thus, a magnificent mass movement of the whole party and the entire people running geological work rapidly formed on a national scale. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the broad masses, with the heroic spirit of "declaring war on the Earth and demanding treasures from the high mountains" and the determination of "not descending the mountain until minerals are found, regardless of wind, sun, or cold," marched into the deep mountains. Many Party secretaries of communes, townships, counties, special districts, and provinces and cities personally took command, organizing millions of people to explore for treasures in the deep mountains. According to incomplete statistics, to date, more than 150,000 mineral deposits of various types have been found nationwide, equivalent to three and a half times the total number of mineral deposits found during the First Five-Year Plan. Among the more than 10,000 mineral sites inspected, there are more than 500 important large mines of various types. Among them, there are more than 140 large iron ore mines, and almost every province, city, and autonomous region has a large iron ore base. Dozens of new large copper and aluminum mines have been found. Chromium and nickel mines, which were extremely scarce in the past, now also have promising production areas. Important discoveries have also been made in rare elements and dispersed elements necessary for the development of cutting-edge industries. It is expected that the proven reserves of various minerals this year will exceed the national plan by several to dozens of times. This greatly improves the distribution of mineral resources in our country and provides relatively sufficient mineral resources for the high-speed development of industry with steel as the key link, and for the establishment of a complete industrial system in our country.

    The discovery of a large number of mineral resources has also created favorable conditions for the widespread blooming of small and medium-sized enterprises. Most of the iron ore and other mineral resources needed by small blast furnaces in many provinces have been guaranteed. For example, in Hubei Province, mineral deposits have been found in every county and district in the province, including 410 iron ore deposits. Gansu Province has submitted 89 iron ore deposits for mining, which can basically guarantee "blast furnaces in every county and flowing iron everywhere." Guizhou Province has established many small blast furnace groups in various counties around the coal and iron ore areas that have been found. Now, 17,000 iron smelting furnaces and some steelmaking furnaces have been put into production.

    The bumper harvest of mineral resources has powerfully refuted various "no mineral" theories and the erroneous views of not believing in the masses, enabling people to gradually liberate themselves from superstition in books and "authorities." During the First Five-Year Plan period, Henan Province had not been able to solve the problem of the Central Plains iron ore base; after vigorously carrying out mass movements this year, almost every county has iron ore, not only medium and small-sized deposits, but also the huge Xuanlong-style sedimentary iron ore. In the past, people believed that there were no Anshan-style iron ore deposits south of the Yangtze River, but this year, Anshan-style iron ore deposits with prospective reserves of hundreds of billions of tons were found in Jiangxi Province. In the past three years, Guangdong Province had only proven 20 million tons of coal reserves, but this year, within a few months, it found more than 4 billion tons of prospective coal reserves, and it is expected that 2 billion tons can be proven by the end of this year. Zhejiang Province, which has always been considered "resource-poor," launched millions of people to the mountains to find minerals after the provincial Party committee criticized the "no mineral" theory. It quickly found more than 5,000 mineral sites, and among the more than 1,500 sites that have been preliminarily inspected, more than 200 have industrial value. Facts have proven that geological work is not unattainable, outdated theories must be broken, and old geological data cannot be fully trusted.

    Breaking the rules and regulations that restrict the development of geological work is an important guarantee for promoting the high-speed development of geological work. For example, changing exploration methods and conducting different degrees of exploration for large, medium, and small types of mineral deposits has enabled the same amount of work to prove reserves equivalent to more than twice that of the past, greatly liberating the productive forces on the geological work front.

    全民普查  万宝丰收
    今年全国找到各种矿产十五万多处
    等于第一个五年计划总和的三倍半
    本报讯　我国地质工作今年得到史无前例的高速度发展，矿产资源获得空前大丰收。
    党中央提出建设社会主义的总路线以后，各地对矿产资源的要求十分迫切，这样在全国范围内就迅速形成了一个规模宏伟的全党全民大办地质的群众运动。在各级党委的领导下，广大群众以“向地球开战，要高山献宝”的豪迈气概，以“不怕风吹日晒天寒，找不到矿产不下山”的决心向深山进军。许多社、乡、县、专区和省、市的党委书记亲自挂帅，组织了千百万人到深山探宝。根据不完全统计，到目前为止，全国已找到各种矿点十五万多处，相当于第一个五年计划期间找到矿点总和的三倍半。在检查过的一万多处矿产地中，就有各种重要大矿五百多处。其中大铁矿有一百四十余处，几乎每个省、市、自治区都有了大铁矿基地。新找到的大铜矿和大铝矿，各有数十处。过去极感缺乏的铬矿和镍矿，现在也有了远景很大的产地。为发展尖端工业所必需的稀有元素和分散元素也有重要发现。预计今年探明的各种矿产储量比国家计划将超过几倍到几十倍。这就大大地改善了我国的矿产分布情况，为以钢为纲的工业高速度发展，为建立我国完整的工业体系，提供了比较充分的矿产资源。
    大量矿产的发现，也为中小型企业的遍地开花，创造了有利的条件。许多省小高炉所需要的铁矿石和其他矿产资源，大部分已经有了保证。例如：湖北省在全省的每个县、区，都找到了矿点，其中铁矿就有四百一十处。甘肃省已经提交开采的铁矿有八十九处，基本上可以保证“县县有高炉，处处流铁水”。贵州省围绕已找到的煤、铁矿区，在各县建立起许多小高炉群，现在已有一万七千座炼铁炉和部分炼钢炉投入了生产。
    矿产资源大丰收，有力地批驳了各种“无矿论”和不相信群众的错误观点，使人们逐渐从迷信书本和“权威”中解放出来。河南省在第一个五年计划期间，一直没有解决中原铁矿基地的问题；在今年大搞群众运动后，几乎县县有铁矿，不仅有中、小型矿床，而且有规模巨大的宣龙式沉积铁矿。过去人们认为长江以南没有鞍山式铁矿，今年在江西省找到了成百亿吨远景储量的鞍山式铁矿。广东省在过去三年中探明的煤矿储量仅二千万吨，今年在几个月内就找到了四十多亿吨煤矿远景储量，预计今年年底可探明二十亿吨。一向被认为“资源不富”的浙江省，在省委批判了“无矿论”以后，发动了成百万人上山找矿，很快就找到了各种矿产地五千多处，在经过初步检查的一千五百多处中，有工业价值的就有二百多处。事实证明，地质工作并非高不可攀，陈腐理论必须打破，旧的地质资料不可全信。
    破除束缚地质工作发展的规章制度，是促使地质工作高速度发展的重要保证。如改变勘探方法，对大、中、小不同类型矿床进行不同程度的勘探，就使相同的工作量探明相当于过去两倍以上的储量，大大地解放了地质工作战线上的生产力。
