Xinhua News Agency, November 8th, Washington dispatch: Eisenhower's statement on the issue of nuclear weapons testing at the White House on the 7th once again shows that the United States government has no intention of reaching an agreement on permanently ceasing nuclear weapons testing.

In this statement, Eisenhower said that he had announced that the United States would suspend further testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons for one year after the start of the Geneva three-nation conference. However, the statement used as an excuse that because "the Soviet Union is continuing nuclear tests," "this action by the Soviet Union relieves (the United States) of any obligations undertaken under its proposed suspension of nuclear weapons testing." Although he also said that the United States would continue to suspend such testing "at present."

Eisenhower's statement deliberately avoided the fact that the Soviet Union has been asking to declare a permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing together with the United States and Britain, but the governments of the United States and Britain have not agreed.

The US announcement of a one-year suspension of nuclear weapons testing starting from November 1st has been widely exposed by world public opinion as just a trick, because one year is exactly the rest period necessary for the United States after conducting a series of intensive tests. At the same time, the United States has put forward various obstructive conditions for a long-term cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

It is believed that Eisenhower's publication of this statement while the Geneva three-nation conference is in progress is aimed at shirking the responsibility of the United States for obstructing the reaching of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and to try to weaken the impact of the Soviet Union's proposal to immediately and permanently ban nuclear weapons testing everywhere on world public opinion.

The British Foreign Office also followed the United States and issued a statement at the same time, announcing "the release of its guarantee to suspend testing for one year from the opening of the Geneva Conference on October 31." British Foreign Secretary Lloyd also insisted that unless a monitoring system is established and the monitoring system is functioning, the United Kingdom and the United States will not agree to stop nuclear weapons testing.

### 艾森豪威尔揭穿自己的骗局  美国无意停止核试验  所谓停试一年的支票不肯兑现

    艾森豪威尔揭穿自己的骗局
    美国无意停止核试验
    所谓停试一年的支票不肯兑现
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔7日在白宫就核武器试验问题发表的声明，再一次表明美国政府无意就永久停止核武器试验达成协议。
    艾森豪威尔在这个声明中说，他曾经宣布，美国将在日内瓦三国会议开始以后的一年内，中止进一步试验原子武器和氢武器。但是，声明借口说由于“苏联在继续进行核试验”，“苏联的这种行动解除了（美国）根据自己提出的中止核武器试验的建议所承担的任何义务”。虽然他又说，美国在“目前”将继续中止这种试验。
    艾森豪威尔的声明有意回避了这个事实：苏联一直在要求同美英一起宣布永久停止核武器试验，但是美英两国政府不答应。
    美国宣布从11月1日起的一年内中止核武器试验的做法已经被广泛的世界舆论拆穿为只是一个骗局，因为一年恰好是美国在进行过一系列紧张试验之后必需的休息时间。同时，美国为长期停止核武器试验提出了种种阻挠的条件。
    人们认为，艾森豪威尔在日内瓦三国会议正在进行期间发表这篇声明，目的在推卸美国阻挠就停止核武器试验达成协议的责任，并力图削弱苏联关于立即在各地永久禁止核武器试验的建议在世界舆论中所产生的影响。
    英国外交部也在同时追随美国发表了声明，宣布“解除它所承担的从10月31日日内瓦会议开幕起停止试验一年的保证”。英国外交大臣劳埃德还坚持说，除非建立起监督制度，并使监督制度发挥作用，否则英美就不答应停止核武器试验。
