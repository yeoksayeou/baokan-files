    Emphasize and Support Mass Art Creation
    Ma Ke
    Not long ago, many national newspapers and periodicals introduced peasant paintings in prominent sections. Workers' and peasants' painting exhibitions and symposiums on mass creation were also held in Beijing and other places. The September issues of "Art" and "Dongfeng" and the 18th issue of "Comics" published special issues and supplements on mass art, respectively. A relatively comprehensive analysis and evaluation was made of the art works that have emerged among workers and peasants since the Great Leap Forward. It is the first time that newspapers and periodicals have selected mass excellent works on such a large scale and expounded on the problems and experiences in the mass art movement. Therefore, it is a strong support and encouragement to the vast number of worker and peasant painters; it is also a good learning opportunity for professional painters.
    Workers and peasants have not only created amazing miracles in production, but also demonstrated rich wisdom and great creative talent in art creation. At present, a magnificent cultural revolution is being launched in rural areas. Many counties have been turned into mural counties, and a creative upsurge of thousands of troops and horses, men, women, old and young, has been formed in towns and villages, truly turning the countryside into a world of pictures. Many people know about the peasant paintings in Pi County and Shulu, but there are countless Pi Counties and Shulus. For example, peasants in Fuyang County and Xiao County, Anhui Province, have also created hundreds of thousands of murals. The creations of the peasants are closely integrated with labor production. They paint what they do, and they paint wherever they produce, making art creation a powerful tool for publicizing the party's policies, reflecting the peasants' thoughts and feelings, praising the advanced, criticizing the backward, and promoting production. It is not only a battle report and leaflet on the production front, but also a large gallery that beautifies the countryside and provides people with appreciation, which has a profound impact on the spiritual and cultural life of the peasants. Similarly, the art activities of Chinese workers are also developing vigorously. The works and experiences introduced in the "Worker's Painting" section of the "Worker's Daily", "Comics", "Dongfeng", and the recently published "Worker's Art Special Issue" of "Art" fully show that the art activities in many factories have become regularized; the factory art groups have truly become an indispensable force in various propaganda works; the workers' comics have become a powerful weapon for self-education in labor. The art group of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory painted more than 2,000 comics and picture stories in four days and four nights for the "Exhibition of Promoting Communist Spirit". The comic strip bulletin "Everyone Paints" of the Tianjin State Cotton No. 6 Factory has been published more than 100 times since 1954 and is very popular among the workers. The workers said that if they don't read "Everyone Paints" when they go to and from work, they feel like they are missing something. Recently, in the creation movement of "Factory History Paintings" carried out by various factories and mines in Tianjin, many exciting picture stories have emerged, which profoundly reflect the workers' class growth, struggle and enthusiasm for building socialism, and have played a great role in promoting production. In short, the mass art movement of workers and peasants, like two rushing torrents, is promoting the leap-forward development of China's entire art movement. In particular, the emergence of thousands of painters who truly come from the working class marks that China's art has entered a new era. The creations of workers and peasants will be two red flowers that will never wither in the garden of Chinese art.
    Faced with such a reality, how art newspapers and periodicals and publishing institutions regularly publish and review excellent mass art works, reflect the situation and problems in the mass art movement, so as to further promote the combination of popularization and improvement and the service of art to politics in theory and creative practice, this is an important task, and it is also a requirement put forward to the editing and publishing work by the objective situation. In recent years, the "Worker's Painting" section of the "Worker's Daily" and the mass creation columns in many other pictorials have achieved a lot. The recent issues of "Art", "Comics" and "Dongfeng" have also made great improvements in this regard, showing the in-depth editing work and the art world's concern for mass creation. This is the embodiment of the budding of communist art in editing work, and it is also the result of the concrete implementation of the party's literary and art policy. However, these are still far from enough compared with the massive mass creation movement. All newspapers and periodicals and publishing houses need to pay attention to the mass art movement with greater strength in the future. In addition, it is also very important to organize editors, artists, and theoretical researchers to go to the masses of workers and peasants in a planned way to conduct "art collection". In this way, on the one hand, it can promote professional artists to learn from the masses and provide guidance; on the other hand, it also prepares materials for compiling the modern history of Chinese art. We firmly believe that due to the great leap forward of the broad masses in art, it will surely promote China's art movement to a new upsurge.

    重视和扶植群众美术创作
    马克
    不久前，全国许多报刊都以显著的篇幅，介绍了农民的绘画。在北京等地还举行了工人和农民的画展和有关工农群众创作的座谈会。9月号的“美术”和“东风”以及十八期的“漫画”，又分别出了群众美术的专号和特刊。对大跃进以来在工农群众中涌现出的美术作品，进行了比较全面地分析和评介。在报刊上像这样大规模地选刊群众的优秀作品，阐述群众美术运动中的问题和经验，这还是头一回。因此，对广大工农画家是个有力的支持和鼓舞；对专业画家也是一次良好的学习机会。
    工人和农民不仅在生产上创造了惊人的奇迹，而且在美术创作上也显示了丰富的智慧和巨大的创造才能。目前农村中正在掀起一个波澜壮阔的文化革命运动。许多县都已经壁画化，在城镇和乡村都形成了千军万马、男女老少齐动手的创作高潮，真正把农村变成了图画的世界。很多人知道了邳县和束鹿的农民绘画，但是还有无数个邳县和束鹿。例如安徽阜阳县和萧县的农民，也创作了数以几十万计的壁画。农民的创作都与劳动生产紧密相结合，干啥画啥，生产到哪里，画就到哪里，使美术创作成为宣传党的政策、反映农民的思想情感、表扬先进批评落后推动生产的有力工具。它既是生产战线上的战报和传单，又是美化农村和供人欣赏的大画廊，对农民的精神和文化生活都有很深刻的影响。同样，我国职工的美术活动也在日益蓬勃的发展。从工人日报、“漫画”和“东风”以及“美术”最近出版的“工人美术专号”介绍的作品与经验当中就充分表明：许多工厂的美术活动已经经常化；工厂美术组已真正成为各项宣传工作中不可缺少的力量；工人的漫画已经变成劳动中进行自我教育的有力武器。上海机床厂美工组为举办“发扬共产主义精神展览会”，在四天四夜中就画了二千多幅漫画和连环画。天津国棉六厂的漫画壁报“大家画”，从1954年一直坚持到现在共出刊一百多期，很为工人喜爱，工人们说上下班如不看“大家画”就像少了一件什么事。最近天津各厂矿开展的“工厂史画”的创作运动中，又出现了许多激动人心的连环画，深刻地反映了工人阶级成长斗争和建设社会主义的热情，对推动生产起了很大的作用。总之，工农群众的美术运动像两条奔腾的巨流，正推动我国整个美术运动飞跃地向前发展。尤其是，成千上万的、真正出身于劳动阶级的画家的出现，更标志着我国的美术已走入了一个崭新的时期。工农群众的创作，将是我国美术百花园中两朵永远不会雕谢的红花。
    面对着这样的现实，各美术报刊和出版机构，如何经常地出版、评介优秀的群众美术作品，反映群众美术运动中的情况和问题，以便在理论上和创作实践上进一步促使普及与提高相结合、艺术为政治服务，这是个重要的任务，也是客观形势向编辑出版工作提出的要求。几年来，“工人日报”坚持出刊的“工人的画”和其他许多画报中的群众创作专栏，都有很多成绩。最近几期的“美术”、“漫画”和“东风”在这方面也有很大改进，表现了编辑工作的深入和美术界对群众创作的关怀。这是共产主义艺术萌芽在编辑工作中的体现，也是具体执行党的文艺方针的结果。但是，这些和声势浩大的群众创作运动相比较还是很不够的，各报刊、出版社今后还需要以更大的力量去积极热情地关注群众美术运动。此外，有计划地组织编辑、美术家和理论研究工作者到工农群众中去进行“美术采风”，也是很重要的工作。这样，一方面可以促使专业美术家向群众学习并进行辅导；另方面也为编写我国近代美术史准备素材。我们深信，由于广大群众在美术上的跃进，一定会促进我国美术运动走向新的高涨。
