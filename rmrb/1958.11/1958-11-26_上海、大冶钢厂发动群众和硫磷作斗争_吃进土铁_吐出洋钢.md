Shanghai and Daye Steel Plant Mobilize the Masses to Fight Sulfur and Phosphorus
Eat Native Iron, Produce Foreign Steel

This Dispatch from our Shanghai Bureau, November 25th. Recently, major steel plants in Shanghai have mobilized the masses to simultaneously focus on production volume and quality. They are overcoming difficulties in every possible way to turn native iron into good steel and steel ingots into steel products. Some steelmaking workshops have even used native iron to produce high-carbon steel and high-quality steel, casting them into castings and rolling them into steel products.

Since late October, Shanghai's steel production has grown rapidly. Basic oxygen furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, which previously could not use or rarely used native iron, are now consuming large amounts of it. Some workshops are using almost entirely native iron for steelmaking.

In early November, Party organizations in various plants generally held mass meetings to review the quality situation in the previous period. They explained that Shanghai is a major supply base for small and medium-sized steel products in China, and improving the quality of steel is crucial for the country's construction next year. Therefore, while increasing production, attention must also be paid to quality.

Recently, a large amount of native iron and good coking coal has been transferred from provinces in the north and south to support Shanghai, greatly encouraging the steelworkers in Shanghai. Many workers said: "Thousands of people have been mobilized from all over the country to transport good raw materials to us from thousands of miles away. We must produce more good steel to thank the support from all regions." They are taking measures from all aspects to fight against the harmful components (sulfur and phosphorus) in native iron. Blast furnace workers have also summarized a set of operating procedures for using native iron to ensure high iron melt temperatures, fast melting, and high efficiency in removing sulfur and phosphorus. Laboratory personnel have increased the number of analyses of iron melt composition, so that furnace-front steelworkers are always aware of the situation.

After this series of improvements, since mid-November, the output and quality of steel plants have significantly improved. The qualification rate of steel at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 in mid-November quickly increased from about 70% at the beginning of the month to about 90%, with three days reaching over 99%. The average daily output of steel also increased by more than 10% compared to the first ten days of the month. Two open-hearth furnace workshops at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and No. 3 recently used 60%-70% native iron and 30%-40% scrap steel to produce about 6,000 tons of steel. Some of it was cast into steel castings used in blast furnaces and rolling mills, and some was high-quality steel for rolling construction steel, all meeting the required quality standards.

Dispatch from our Huangshi Bureau, November 25th. Daye Steel Plant has rolled out a large number of qualified steel products made from steel produced using native iron. These steel products have been continuously transported to all parts of the country to meet the needs of basic construction and industrial production.

Since September, most of the pig iron used for steelmaking in this plant has been native iron. The sulfur content of steel made with this native iron is generally between 0.1% and 0.2% (the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry stipulates that the sulfur content of steel should not exceed 0.055%), and some is as high as 0.53%. After trial rolling, these steels have all been successfully rolled into steel products. After tensile tests, the tensile properties of these steels all meet the requirements stipulated by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry.

At present, Daye Steel Plant effectively controls the sulfur content in steel and continuously improves the quality of steel, so that steel made from native iron can be rolled into qualified steel products.

### 上海、大冶钢厂发动群众和硫磷作斗争  吃进土铁　吐出洋钢

    上海、大冶钢厂发动群众和硫磷作斗争
    吃进土铁　吐出洋钢
    本报上海25日电　上海各大型钢铁厂最近发动群众一手抓产量，一手抓质量，千方百计克服困难，把土铁炼成好钢，把钢锭轧成钢材。有的炼钢车间还用土铁炼出了高炭钢和优质钢，浇成了铸件，轧成了钢材。
    10月下旬以来，上海各钢厂产量增长很快，一向不能用和极少用土铁的酸性转炉和平炉也大吃土铁，有的车间几乎全部用土铁炼钢。
    11月初，各厂党组织普遍召开群众大会检查了前一时期质量情况，说明上海是我国中小型钢材的主要供应基地，提高钢的质量对明年的国家建设关系很大，因此提高产量，必须同时注意质量。
    最近，从南北各省调运大批的土铁、好焦炭支援上海，大大鼓舞了上海的炼钢工人。很多工人说：各地出动了成千上万的人，千里迢迢给我们运来了好原料，我们一定要炼出更多的好钢来答谢各地的支援。他们从各个方面采取措施，和土铁中的有害成分（硫和磷）作斗争。化铁炉工人也总结出一套用土铁的操作规程，使铁水温度高，化得快，去硫磷的效率高。化验人员增加对铁水成分的化验次数，使炉前炼钢工人经常心中有数。
    经过这一系列的改进，11月中旬以来，各钢厂的产量、质量都有显著提高。上钢六厂中旬钢铁的合格率迅速从月初的70％提高到90％左右，有三天达到99％以上，钢的平均日产量也比上旬提高10％以上。上钢一厂和三厂两个平炉车间最近一星期用60％—70％的土铁和30％—40％的废钢炼出约六千吨钢，有的浇成高炉和轧钢机上用的钢铸件，有的是轧制建筑用钢材的优质钢，质量都符合要求。
    本报黄石25日电　大冶钢厂用土铁炼成的钢轧出大批合格钢材。这些钢材已源源运往全国各地，供应基本建设和工业生产需要。
    这个厂9月份以来所用炼钢生铁大部分是土铁，用这些土铁炼的钢含硫一般在0.1％至0.2％（冶金工业部规定钢的含硫量不超过0.055％），还有的高达0.53％。这些钢经过试轧，都顺利的轧成了钢材。这些钢材经过拉力试验，抗张性能都符合冶金工业部规定的要求。
    目前大冶钢厂由于对钢中含硫量进行有效控制，不断提高钢的质量，用土铁炼的钢都能轧出合格的钢材来。
