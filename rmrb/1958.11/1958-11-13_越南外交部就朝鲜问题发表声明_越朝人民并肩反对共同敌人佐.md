Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 12th. The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a statement on the Korean question.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea is an important event that helps ease tensions in the Far East and the world. This is a huge contribution to creating favorable conditions for a peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

The statement said that while the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are taking such peaceful initiatives, the United States, instead of withdrawing its troops from South Korea, is constantly and illegally shipping new weapons to South Korea, establishing missile bases in South Korea, and attempting to turn South Korea into a U.S. nuclear weapons base. These actions by the United States continue to create tension in Korea and threaten peace in the Far East.

The statement said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports the statement issued by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on October 28, 1958, which demanded that the U.S. troops and troops from other countries currently stationed in South Korea immediately withdraw from South Korea and allow the Korean people to resolve the peaceful reunification of their country themselves without external interference.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the United States, manipulating the majority in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, rejected the Soviet proposal to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the United Nations General Assembly to discuss issues related to Korea, thereby violating the provisions of the United Nations Charter and infringing on the rights of the Korean people. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports the position of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in demanding that its representatives participate in United Nations discussions on issues related to Korea, and believes that any discussion and resolution on the Korean question is worthless without the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The statement concluded by saying that due to the interventionist conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, Korea and Vietnam are in the same situation of national division. The Vietnamese people deeply understand the Korean people and firmly support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country. The Vietnamese people are confident that the Korean people, with their tradition of heroic struggle, and with the sympathy and support of peace-loving forces around the world, will surely be able to shatter all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and complete the cause of national reunification.

    越南外交部就朝鲜问题发表声明
    越朝人民并肩反对共同敌人
    新华社河内12日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天就朝鲜问题发表声明。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府认为中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜是有助于缓和远东和世界紧张局势的一个重要事件。这是为和平解决朝鲜问题创造有利条件而作出的一个巨大贡献。
    声明说，当中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府采取这种和平创举的时候，美国却不但不肯从南朝鲜撤军，反而不断非法向南朝鲜运进新式武器，在南朝鲜建立导弹基地，力图把南朝鲜变为美国的核武器基地。美国的这些行动继续造成朝鲜局势的紧张和威胁着远东的和平。
    声明说，越南民主共和国完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在1958年10月28日发表的声明，这项声明要求目前驻在南朝鲜的美国军队和其它国家的军队立即撤出南朝鲜，让朝鲜人民在没有外力干涉的情况下自己解决国家的和平统一问题。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府认为，美国操纵联合国大会政治委员会中的多数，否决了苏联关于邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加联合国大会讨论有关朝鲜问题的会议的建议，从而违反了联合国宪章的条款和侵犯了朝鲜人民的权利。越南民主共和国政府完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府要求有自己的代表参加联合国讨论有关朝鲜问题的会议的立场，并且认为任何有关朝鲜问题的讨论和决议，如果没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加，都是没有价值的。
    声明最后说，由于美帝国主义的干涉阴谋，朝鲜和越南处于国家被分裂的相同境地。越南人民深深地了解朝鲜人民，坚决支持朝鲜人民争取和平统一国家的斗争。越南人民确信，具有英勇斗争传统的朝鲜人民，在全世界爱好和平力量的同情和支持下，一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋，完成统一国家的事业。
