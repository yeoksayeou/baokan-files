    Xinhua News Agency, 26th. Gu Mu, Vice Chairman of the State Economic Commission, gave a report to the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress this afternoon, introducing the achievements and situation of our country's industrial construction over the past year.
    In the first part of his report, Gu Mu pointed out that the achievements made in China's industrial construction in 1958 were extremely great. The mass movement of the whole people to make steel, which drove the overall leap forward in the entire industrial construction and transportation, has made China's industry not only shine brightly in large and medium-sized cities, but also blossom everywhere in the vast rural areas of the country. It is unprecedented to carry out industrial construction by means of such a large-scale mass movement. Tens of millions of people have devoted themselves to the industrial front, working selflessly day and night, so that China's industrial construction has developed by leaps and bounds at a very alarming speed.
    Gu Mu then described the rapid development of China's steel, coal, machinery, electric power, textile and other industries and transportation this year. He said that the increase in the output of several major industrial products in China over the past year has exceeded the total increase in the past few years, which is equivalent to the road traveled by capitalist countries in decades.
    While talking about the increase in the quantity and development speed of industrial products, Gu Mu also talked about the great achievements made in industrial production technology this year. He said that because the broad masses have established the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, liberated their minds, and launched a mass movement in production technology and design process, a situation of "letting a hundred flowers blossom" has emerged in technology. We have gained a lot in new product trial production, in technical innovation, and even in mastering cutting-edge technology.
    Gu Mu also mentioned that miracles not only appeared in industrial production, but also in capital construction. This year's capital construction, both in scale and content, is the largest and most numerous in history.
    He also said that the achievements in ideological and political aspects on the industrial front are also extremely great. After the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the awareness of the broad masses of workers has been greatly improved, the relationship between people in enterprises has been completely changed, the leading role of the Party has been greatly strengthened, and people's communist ideology has been greatly promoted.
    Gu Mu said that young people across the country have made many contributions in the Great Leap Forward. Under the leadership of the Party, they have, like on other fronts, fully played their due role in the past year.
    In the second part of his report, Gu Mu clarified the reasons for the great achievements in industrial construction. He said that the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the correct implementation of the general line of socialist construction proposed by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, putting politics in command, liberating the mind, and earnestly implementing the policy of "taking steel as the key link" to drive all industrial construction, the simultaneous development of large, medium and small enterprises, and the two-legged approach of "small indigenous groups" and "large foreign groups", and launching a mass movement in industry, were the decisive factors for the great victory in industrial construction this year. These policies are the correct road for developing industry at high speed in China, which Chairman Mao creatively found out based on Marxist-Leninist theory and combined with China's actual conditions. This road will guide us to continuously achieve new and greater victories in future industrial construction.
    In the third part of his report, Gu Mu talked about some of the work that must be done in order to complete the arduous tasks of the industrial front next year. He said that we should conscientiously implement the various tasks decided by the recently held National Industrial Secretaries Conference. In steel production, we must overcome the three barriers of pig iron quality, the barrier of foreign furnaces eating local iron, and the barrier of steel quantity and variety, so that iron becomes steel, steel becomes material, material becomes equipment, and equipment becomes complete sets. The indigenous and small blast furnaces in various places should be reorganized, consolidated and improved in a planned and step-by-step manner, focusing on "five fixings", and gradually achieve basification and factoryization. In large enterprises, it is necessary to continue to deeply and universally mobilize the masses to fight for increasing output, improving quality, and increasing varieties. In other industries, the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and combining large, medium and small enterprises should also be continued. The industrial front and the transportation front should also continue to carry out the technical revolution movement.
    Finally, Gu Mu hoped that the youth on the industrial and transportation fronts would work hard together with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party, learn modestly, be realistic, study technology and cultural knowledge, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, and continue to improve their communist awareness, so as to continue to play the role of shock troops in the greater leap forward in industrial production next year.

    开展群众运动进行工业建设
    谷牧向青年积极分子大会报告工业建设情况
    新华社26日讯　国家经济委员会副主任谷牧今天下午向全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会作报告，介绍了一年来祖国在工业建设方面的成就和情况。
    谷牧在报告的第一部分指出，1958年我国在工业建设上所取得的成就是极其伟大的。全民大办钢铁的群众运动所带动起来的整个工业建设和交通运输的全面跃进，使我国的工业不仅在大、中城市中大放光彩，而且也在全国广大农村中遍地开花。用这样大规模的群众运动的办法来进行工业建设，这是史无前例的。几千万人投入了工业战线，夜以继日地进行着忘我的劳动，使我国的工业建设以非常惊人的速度大踏步地向前发展着。
    谷牧接着叙述了今年我国钢铁、煤炭、机械、电力、纺织等工业和交通运输方面飞跃发展的情况。他说，一年来我国若干主要的工业产品产量的增长，超过了过去几年增长的总和，等于资本主义国家几十年走过的路程。
    在谈到工业产品数量的增长和发展速度的同时，谷牧并且谈到了今年工业生产技术上所取得的巨大成绩。他说，由于广大群众树立了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，解放了思想，在生产技术、设计工艺方面大闹群众运动，因而在技术上出现了“百花齐放”的局面。在新产品试制方面，在技术革新方面，甚至在掌握尖端技术水平方面，我们都有了很大的收获。
    谷牧还提到，奇迹还不仅出现在工业生产方面，也出现在基本建设方面。今年的基本建设，无论在规模上、内容上都是历史上最大最多的一年。
    他又说，工业战线上思想政治方面的成就也是极其伟大的，在整风、反右派斗争胜利之后，广大职工觉悟大大提高，企业中人与人的关系完全改变了，党的领导作用大大加强了，人们的共产主义思想大大发扬。
    谷牧说，在大跃进中，全国青年做出了不少的贡献。他们在党的领导下，在过去一年中，和在其他战线上一样，充分地发挥了他们应有的作用。
    谷牧在报告的第二部分阐明工业建设取得伟大成就的原因时说，党中央和毛主席的正确领导，正确执行党的八大二次会议所提出的社会主义建设总路线，政治挂帅，解放思想，切实贯彻“以钢为纲”带动一切工业建设，大中小并举，“小土群”、“大洋群”两条腿走路，在工业中大搞群众运动的方针，这是今年工业建设取得伟大胜利的决定性因素。这些方针，也就是毛主席根据马克思列宁主义理论，结合我国的实际情况，创造性地找出来的一条在中国高速度发展工业的正确道路，这条道路将引导我们在今后的工业建设中不断地取得新的更大的胜利。
    谷牧在报告的第三部分谈到了为了完成明年工业战线的艰巨的任务而必须做好的一些工作。他说，我们应当很好地贯彻不久前开过的全国工业书记会议所决定的各项工作，在钢铁生产中必须攻下生铁质量关，洋炉子吃土铁关和钢材数量、品种关这三道关口，使铁成钢，使钢成材，使材成器，使器成套。对各地土高炉和小高炉要有计划，有步骤地以“五定”为中心进行整理、巩固和提高工作，并逐步做到基地化、工厂化。在大企业里，必须继续深入地、普遍地发动群众，为提高产量、提高质量、增加品种而斗争。在其他工业方面，同样也应该继续贯彻土洋并举和大中小结合的方针。工业战线和交通战线还要继续开展技术革命运动。
    谷牧最后希望工业交通战线上的青年们和全国人民一起，在党的领导下努力工作，虚心学习，实事求是，学习技术和文化知识，学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进经验，继续提高共产主义的觉悟，以便在明年工业生产更大的跃进中，继续发挥突击队的作用。
