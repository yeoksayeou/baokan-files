    A Mother of Seven Goes to University
    Lu Linying, Female Commune Member of Zhanglu People's Commune, Xin County, Shandong Province
    When I was ten years old, my parents couldn't bear the exploitation and oppression of the landlords, so they left me at my grandmother's house and fled to the Northeast. At that time, I saw the landlord's children going to school, and I was both angry and envious. I asked my grandmother to allow me to go to school too, but my grandmother's family was also very poor at that time, and she always answered me: "Child! It's good enough that your parents are not at home to even eat, where would the money for schooling come from?" Although I was young at the time, I felt sour and bitter in my heart when I heard these words, and that's how my idea of going to school was dispelled. Until I got married, I was still illiterate, living a muddled life for half my life. The suffering of having no education is truly endless.
    After Xin County was liberated, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led the peasants in a great political, economic, and cultural transformation. I participated in cultural studies in the first month of 1952, when I already had six children. I thought to myself: "There are so many household chores, and I'm already thirty-four or five years old, I won't be able to remember anything I learn, it's a waste of effort." I was never at ease while studying. Later, after continuous education from the village Party branch and the patient help of the teachers, I turned back to study hard. After studying for a while, my grades were very good, and the village and district praised me, which gave me great encouragement. From then on, under the leadership of the Party, I resolved to study diligently and practice hard, and now I am studying at the agricultural university.
    The difficulties I encountered in learning culture were not few. At that time, I needed to cook three meals a day, grind flour every four days, and sew dozens of sets of shoes, socks, and clothes for seven children. I also had to go to the fields to work and attend necessary meetings, but these difficulties did not scare me. I often thought: In the past, in the old society, we had little to eat and wear. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao came and led us to turn ourselves over politically and economically. Now we are vigorously engaged in mutual aid and cooperation in production, heading towards the bright road of socialism and communism. Without culture, it is difficult to achieve greater increases in production, so I resolved to study. I often thought: No matter how many difficulties there are, they are not as numerous as my thoughts; no matter how great the difficulties are, they are not as great as my determination! Under the specific education of the Party branch, I overcame all difficulties. For the needlework of the whole family, in addition to planning to use rainy days and getting up early and going to bed late, I also came up with a way to "do the work ahead of time, and not let the work pile up." For the children, I made some paper, wooden sticks, and toys for them, using the method of older children looking after younger children to keep them from making trouble. Before eating, I first distributed the bowls and chopsticks, and specially made small benches for each of them, writing each child's name on the bench, and educating them to recognize their names and take their seats. Because I patiently educated the children, none of them spoke while eating, so my study time increased.
    I adopted a method of studying while working. I often drew on the ground while burning firewood, drew on the head of the bed while breastfeeding the children, drew in the air while pushing the mill, and drew on the table while eating. Walking while drawing on the palm of my hand, etc., were all methods for me to learn to write characters. I studied while weaving on the loom and while spinning on the spinning wheel. I also studied while doing needlework. Time was extremely precious to me. If I didn't study for a day, I would always regret it and couldn't sleep at night. For new characters, I used the method of remembering the shape of the character and asking for the pronunciation. Once, I learned the character "陡" (dǒu - steep), and asked many people, but no one recognized it. I kept its appearance in mind, and later went to visit relatives in Macun, and my relatives taught it to me.
    I also paid attention to writing more. I wrote all the characters I learned one to three times, and the difficult characters six or seven times. It was very effective. "Seeing it a thousand times is not as good as doing it once" is truly a proven truth. Wooden sticks, pebbles, branches, bricks, and fingers were all my writing pens, and walls, doors, tables, etc., were all my writing paper. I have learned that as long as you can make up your mind, keep the book with you, keep the characters in your heart, learn whenever you have time, ask whenever you don't know, and don't be afraid of difficulties, you will definitely be able to learn well with diligent study and practice.
    Six years ago, I was still an illiterate person, but now I have learned to recognize more than 3,000 characters, which has enabled me to learn a lot of knowledge and improve my ideological awareness. I have read more than 300 books such as "Gao Yu Bao", "Shi Ruifen", and "Common Sense of Women's Hygiene". I read the Dazhong Daily and Xin County Daily every day. It made me, a rural woman who "doesn't go to the market for ten years and doesn't go to the fair for eight years," also know about Michurin's creations, Liu Hulan's heroic deeds, and know that the country's steel production will soon surpass that of the United Kingdom. More importantly, it made me know that American wolves are our mortal enemies, the Soviet Union is our most loyal friend, and the Volunteer Army are our most beloved people. All of these have encouraged me to move forward. Therefore, after graduating from literacy classes, I went on to study in amateur elementary school, amateur middle school, and now I am studying at the amateur Red and Expert University, and I have been persevering in my studies.
    Because I have initially mastered culture, I have become a propagandist for the Party. I patiently propagate to others all the superior instructions, policies and principles that I have read. And take the lead in implementing national policies. Therefore, my family has been awarded the honorary title of "Model Family" for many years. At the same time, while serving as a teacher in a people's school, I gained new knowledge of educating children, improved my past method of losing my temper when I saw children making noise, and patiently persuaded and educated them. Therefore, the children are very sensible. Whenever strangers come to my house, they all know to greet them and offer them a seat. If you ask them what they want to do in the future, they will say: "Study hard when we are young, work hard in production when we grow up to make satellites, and serve in the military if the country needs us."
    Since graduating from literacy classes, I have loved learning agricultural technology the most, so I have read a lot of books and newspapers on agricultural technology. This year, to ensure a bumper harvest of 295 mu of cotton in our village, I and four other comrades, under the guidance of the Party branch, formed a technical research group and observed and researched in the fields every day. For example, in order to solve the problem of cotton pests, we borrowed some books on this topic from the library. After studying and discussing, everyone agreed that "treating pests starts with preventing pests, and preventing them well means no pests will grow" is a fundamental experience. So we continuously sprayed the weeds along the village, roadsides, and field edges with pesticides five times, ensuring full and strong cotton seedlings, and achieving a bumper harvest. Currently, each mu has yielded 178 jin of cotton. According to the cotton technicians stationed in Zhongmutuan, this year the 295 mu of cotton in our village can yield an average of more than 440 jin per mu, of which the two mu of experimental fields can yield more than 1,000 jin per mu, an increase of two to three times more than last year.
    I really didn't expect that I, a "blind person" for half my life, would open my eyes again. I know that this is thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I will definitely not be complacent or arrogant, resolutely listen to the Party's words, continue to study hard, become a red agricultural expert, and create even greater miracles on the agricultural front. Only then will it not be a waste to have learned culture!

    七个孩子的妈妈上大学
    山东莘县张鲁人民公社女社员　路林英
    我十岁那年，父母因抗不住地主的剥削压迫，把我丢在外祖母家，就逃荒到东北去了。当时我看到地主家的孩子去上学，又生气，又眼热，要求外祖母也允许我去上学，但那时外祖母家也很穷，她总是回答我：“孩子！你爹娘不在家吃上饭就算不错了，上学的钱从哪里来？”那时我虽年幼，但听到这番话，心里酸一阵，辣一阵的，就这样把我上学的念头打消了，直到结婚，还是一字不识，糊糊涂涂的过了半辈子，没有文化的苦真是几天也说不完。
    莘县解放后，共产党和毛主席领导农民进行了政治、经济、文化上的大翻身，我在1952年的正月参加文化学习，当时已有六个孩子了。我心里想：“家务事那么多，又是三十四、五岁的人了，学也记不住，白费工夫，”学习老是不安心。后又经村党支部不断的教育和老师耐心的帮助，才又回过头来努力学习，学了一段，成绩很好，村里、区里开会就表扬我，给了我很大鼓舞，从此，在党的领导下我就下决心苦学苦练，现在已经到农业大学学习了。
    我学文化遇到的困难不能算少，那时一天需要做三顿饭，四天磨一次面，七个孩子的鞋袜、衣服就得几十套，还要下地生产和参加必要的会议，但这些困难没有将我吓倒，我常想：过去旧社会少吃无穿，共产党和毛主席来了，领导我们在政治、经济上翻身了；现在大搞互助合作生产，奔向社会主义和共产主义的光明大道，没有文化搞更大的增产是有困难的，于是就下决心学习。我常想：困难再多，没我的心眼多，困难再大没我的决心大！在党支部的具体教育下，使我扫平了一切困难。全家的针线活，我除有计划的利用阴雨天和早起晚睡做以外，还想了个“有活提前做，不让活儿堆疙瘩”的办法。对孩子我给他们制了些纸片、木棒、玩具，利用大孩子看小孩子的办法，使他们不胡闹。吃饭前我先把碗、筷分好，又专为他们每人做了小板凳，板凳上写上每个孩子的名字，教育他们认名入座。由于对孩子耐心地进行了教育，吃饭时没有一个说话的，就这样我的学习时间就增多了。
    我采取了一面做活，一面学习的办法。经常是烧火地上划，孩子吃奶炕头划，推磨空中划，吃饭桌上划，走路手心划等办法学习写字，织布时就在机上学，纺花时就在车边学，做针线活时也学，时间对我来说极为宝贵。一天不学习，晚上总后悔的睡不着觉。对生字，我用记着字形问音的办法。有一次学到一个“陡”字，问了很多人，都不认得，我一直记住它的模样，后来到马村去串亲戚，由亲戚教会了我。
    我还注意多写，所学的字，都写一至三遍，难的字就写六、七遍，很管事，“眼过千遍，不如手过一遍”真是一个千真万确的道理。木棒、石子、树枝、砖头、手指头都是我写字的笔，墙壁、门板、桌面等都是我写字的纸。我体验到只要能下决心，利用书不离身、字不离心，有空就学、不会就问，不怕困难、苦学苦练一定能够学好。
    六年前我还是一字不识的糊涂人，现在我已认识三千多字，使我知道了许多知识，提高了思想觉悟，我已读过“高玉宝”“史瑞芬”“妇女卫生常识”等三百多本书，大众报和莘县报每天都看，它使我这个“十年不赶集、八年不赶会”的农村妇女，也知道了米丘林的创造，刘胡兰的英雄事迹，知道了祖国的钢铁产量很快就要超过英国。更重要的使我知道了美国狼是我们的死对头，苏联是我们最忠诚的朋友，志愿军是我们最可爱的人，这一些都鼓舞着我的前进。所以我扫盲毕业后，经过业余高小、业余中学学习，现在又上了业余红专大学，一直坚持不懈的学习。
    由于我初步掌握了文化，使我变成了党的宣传员。凡是我读过的上级指示、方针、政策我都耐心地向别人宣传。并且带头执行国家政策。因此，俺家连年都得到“模范家庭”的光荣称号。同时我在任民校教师时获得了新的教育孩子的知识，改进了过去看到孩子吵闹就耍脾气的办法，耐心地向他们进行说服教育，因而孩子们都很懂话，只要有生人到俺家去，他们都知道问好、让坐，你要问他们将来干什么？他们就说：“小时好好读书，大了好好生产劳动搞卫星，国家需要就服兵役”。
    我自扫盲毕业后最爱学习农业技术，所以有关农业技术方面的书报可没少看哩。今年保证俺村二百九十五亩棉花的大丰收，我和刘墨菊等四个同志，在党支部的指导下，组成了一个技术研究小组，每天都在田间观察研究，如我们为了解决棉花的虫害，就到图书室借了些有关这方面的书籍，经过学习讨论，大家一致认为“治虫先防虫，防好不生虫”是条根本经验，便一连将村边，道旁，地头上的杂草用杀虫药喷打了五次，保证了棉花的苗全苗旺，获得了大丰收，现下每亩已拾棉一百七十八斤，据住中牟疃的棉花技术员评论，今年俺村二百九十五亩棉花可平均亩产四百四十斤以上，其中二亩试验田，可亩产千斤以上，比去年要增产二至三倍还多。
    我真想不到我这半辈子的“瞎子”又睁开了眼，我知道这是托了共产党和毛主席的福。我一定不自满、不骄傲，坚决听党的话，继续努力学习，做一个红色的农业专家，在农业战线上，创造更大的奇迹，这才不是白学文化哩！
