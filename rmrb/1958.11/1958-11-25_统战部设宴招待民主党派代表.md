Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: The United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee hosted a banquet this evening to entertain representatives attending the National Congresses of the democratic parties currently being held in Beijing. More than 1,500 members of various democratic parties attended.

In the banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel, guests cheerfully discussed the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the country, their experiences and observations, and their mutual learning and lives. Major leaders of the various democratic parties attended the banquet, including Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Wang Shao'ao, Ji Fang, Chen Qiyou, Xu Deheng, and Xu Mengshan. The China Democratic National Construction Association is not currently holding a national meeting, but the standing committee members in Beijing were invited to attend the banquet. Non-Party democrat Chen Shutong also attended the banquet.

Xu Bing, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, welcomed the representatives at the beginning of the banquet. He said that in the past year and the first half of this year, all the democratic parties have carried out the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, which has enabled us to draw a clear line with the bourgeois line of the Rightists, and has enabled us to improve politically and ideologically, and to achieve further unity on the basis of socialist construction. This is a great achievement.

Xu Bing said, we fully believe that on the basis of this victory, we will cooperate with the democratic parties for a long time and consolidate. He said that your holding of the congress on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist and rectification movement should be said to be a congress of progress and a congress of unity. You will certainly be able to summarize the experience of the anti-Rightist and rectification movement in the congress, and will formulate practical plans for future political stance and ideological transformation, and for the transformation of the organization. It will also enable the democratic parties to contribute greater and more efforts to socialist construction under the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision.

Xu Bing finally expressed his warm congratulations on the success of the congresses of the democratic parties. Xu Bing's speech was greeted with warm applause from the audience.

At the banquet, Cheng Qian and Huang Yanpei also spoke, expressing their gratitude to the hosts for their hospitality.

    统战部设宴招待民主党派代表
    新华社24日讯　中共中央统战工作部今晚举行宴会，招待出席正在北京举行的各民主党派全国代表大会的代表。到会的各民主党派成员共有一千五百多人。
    在北京饭店宴会大厅里，主客们愉快地谈论着国内大跃进的形势，谈论着他们的所见所闻，以及他们相互之间的学习和生活。各民主党派的主要负责人都出席了宴会，他们当中有：李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、王绍鏊、季方、陈其尤、许德珩、徐萌山。中国民主建国会目前没有举行全国性的会议，在京的中央常委应邀出席了宴会。出席宴会的还有无党派民主人士陈叔通。
    中共中央统战部副部长徐冰在宴会开始时向到会代表表示欢迎。他说，去年一年和今年上半年，各民主党派都进行了反右派斗争，进行了整风运动，这就使我们同右派的资产阶级路线划清了界限，使我们在政治上和思想上提高了一步，在为社会主义建设的基础上达到了更进一步的团结。这是很大的成绩。
    徐冰说，我们充分地相信，在这个胜利的基础上，我们和各民主党派会长期地、巩固地合作的。他说，你们在反右派和整风的胜利基础上开代表大会，应该说是进步的大会，团结的大会，你们一定能够在代表大会中总结反右派和整风的经验，对于今后政治立场和思想的改造，对于组织的改造，将会定出切合实际的方案，也将会使各民主党派在长期共存、互相监督的方针下，对社会主义建设贡献出更大更多的力量。
    徐冰最后表示热烈祝贺各民主党派代表大会的成功。徐冰的讲话引起全场热烈鼓掌。
    宴会上，程潜和黄炎培也讲了话，对宴会主人的盛情招待表示感谢。
