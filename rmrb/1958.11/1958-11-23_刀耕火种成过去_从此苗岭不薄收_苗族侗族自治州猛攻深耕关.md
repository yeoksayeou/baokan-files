    This newspaper reports that reporter Liu Yangshen reported: The 1.9 million people of all ethnic groups in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province, have completely changed the backward production habits of "slash-and-burn agriculture, extensive planting with meager harvests" that have existed for thousands of years. They are vigorously carrying out an autumn plowing and sowing campaign centered on deep plowing of the land, laying a reliable foundation for large-scale high-yield harvests of summer crops next year. As of November 6, the prefecture had plowed 680,000 mu of land, of which 79% was plowed to a depth of eight inches or more. The more than 800 large and small high-yield dams used to launch summer harvest high-yield "satellites" have generally been deeply plowed to a depth of one and a half to two feet.
    For the past half-month, whether at the foot of Leigong Mountain, the main peak of the Miao Mountains, or along the Qingshui River, Miao, Dong, and Han farmers have been camping in the fields, working day and night to deeply plow the land. On some of the wider and more fertile fields, deep plows, double-wheeled double-share plows, and rope-drawn machines are all showing their power; various draught animals, including the "fighting bulls" previously raised for fighting, are all contributing to deep plowing. Industrious Miao and Dong women have now taken off their pleated long skirts and are lightly dressed for plowing, carrying manure, and sowing seeds, becoming the main force in autumn plowing and sowing. Their revolutionary drive has made many male commune members willingly admit defeat.
    Deep plowing is a major revolution in agricultural production in Qiandongnan. For thousands of years, people of all ethnic groups in the old society generally practiced shallow plowing or no plowing at all due to a lack of iron farm tools and draught animals. After liberation, extensive planting and shallow plowing were changed, but not completely. Even during the Great Leap Forward this spring, the land plowed in various places was only four or five inches deep.
    In order to change this backward mode of production and meet the requirement of an average yield of 1,500 jin of wheat and 700 jin of rapeseed per mu for summer crops next year, the Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee proposed concentrating all available animal power and deep plowing farm tools to resolutely deep plow all autumn-plowed land to a depth of eight inches or more, and the 600,000 mu of high-yield dams must be deeply plowed to a depth of one and a half to two feet. Subsequently, a debate on "Is deep plowing good?" and "Can summer crops make a great leap forward?" was launched throughout the prefecture, and farmers were organized to visit, and on-site meetings were held, making the benefits of deep plowing known to every household and the plans and measures known to everyone.
    Due to the full mobilization of the masses' enthusiasm and the clear definition of the goals, since the end of October, the 600,000-strong autumn plowing army in the prefecture has moved cattle, farm tools, as well as public canteens and nurseries, to the fields, organized professional teams, and adopted a continuous operation method, with division of labor and cooperation, to vigorously attack the deep plowing hurdle.

### 刀耕火种成过去　从此苗岭不薄收  苗族侗族自治州猛攻深耕关

    刀耕火种成过去　从此苗岭不薄收
    苗族侗族自治州猛攻深耕关
    本报讯　记者刘扬深报道：贵州省黔东南苗族侗族自治州一百九十万各族人民，彻底改变千百年来“刀耕火种、广种薄收”的落后生产习惯，大搞以深翻土地为中心的秋耕秋种运动，为明年夏收作物大面积高额丰产打下可靠基础。到11月6日止，全州已翻犁土地六十八万亩，其中深耕八寸以上的占79％。作为放夏收高产卫星的八百多个大小丰产坝，普遍深耕一尺五寸到两尺。
    半月以来，不论在苗岭主峰雷公山下或清水江边，苗族、侗族和汉族农民们在田野里安营扎寨，不分日夜大战深耕。在一些比较宽广、肥沃的田坝上，深耕犁、双轮双铧犁和绳索牵引机齐显威风；各种耕畜，包括以往喂来打架玩的“斗牛”，都在为深耕效劳。勤劳的苗族、侗族妇女们，现在脱下了百折长裙，轻装在犁土、挑粪、播种，成了秋耕秋种的主力军。她们那股革命干劲，使许多男社员不得不甘拜下风。
    深耕是黔东南农业生产的一个重大革命。千百年来，各族人民在旧社会由于缺乏铁质农具和耕畜，一般是浅耕或不耕。解放后，广种浅耕有了改变，但不彻底，即使在大跃进的今春，各地翻犁土地也不过四、五寸。
    为了改变这种落后的生产方式，适应明年夏收作物平均亩产小麦一千五百斤、油菜七百斤的要求，中共黔东南自治州委提出集中一切可以集中的畜力、深耕农具，将所有秋耕土地坚决深耕八寸以上，六十万亩丰产坝必须深耕一尺五寸到两尺。接着在全州开展以“深耕好不好”、“夏收作物能不能大跃进”的辩论，并组织农民参观，开现场会议，使深耕好处家喻户晓，计划措施人人皆知。
    由于充分发挥了群众干劲，明确了奋斗目标，从10月下旬以来，全州六十多万秋耕大军就把耕牛、农具，以及公共食堂、托儿组等，一齐搬到田间，组织专业队伍，采取流水作业方法，分工协作，猛攻深耕关。
