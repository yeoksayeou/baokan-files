    We Spent an Unforgettable Day
    Jin Zhiqian, Korean student of the Department of Civil Engineering, Tsinghua University
    When we heard the news that our beloved leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, would revisit Tsinghua University, we Korean students were extremely excited. Our joy was truly indescribable.
    The night before, we gathered together, talking about this and that, chatting very late into the night, none of us willing to sleep early. Three months ago, we had returned to our homeland to celebrate our summer vacation. Naturally, what we had seen and heard during the summer vacation became the content of our conversation. We had seen the construction of Pyongyang, the soaring enthusiasm of the working people, and the university students of our homeland participating in productive labor, with education and production gradually combining... However, in the three months since our departure, our homeland's Chollima has been advancing even faster towards socialism and communism. When we read "Rodong Sinmun" every day, knowing that newly made trains, newly made cars, newly made excavators... were constantly emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, how could we not be excited? How could we not be thrilled? In just one day, our beloved leader would be by our side, which would be the happiest moment of our lives. So, each of us was thinking: How can we repay the care of the Party and the leader? How can we become builders of socialism and communism more quickly? Especially, what kind of achievements can we report to our country?
    At night, many people were too excited to sleep. Early the next morning, without even eating breakfast, we went to the entrance of the Second Classroom Building to wait for our beloved Marshal Kim Il-sung. After ten o'clock, the Chinese students on both sides of the road cheered. People applauded enthusiastically, shouting, "Welcome Premier Kim Il-sung!" At this moment, Premier Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou Enlai walked side by side, smiling and waving frequently to the welcoming crowd. The wild joy and cheers of us Korean students were even more enthusiastic and louder. Many students were so excited that their eyes were filled with tears, as if the entire homeland was embracing us.
    We accompanied our beloved leader to visit our school. Marshal Kim Il-sung very kindly asked about our studies and life. He said, "How are you studying? Can you learn more and better advanced science and technology to build our country?" We replied in unison, "Yes! With the teachings of the Party and you, and the enthusiastic help of the Chinese Party and school, how can we not? We must complete our studies." He smiled with satisfaction and said to us, "Yes, you should study hard. China's work-study program is very good! It can not only enable you to study, but also engage in production, and also conduct scientific research!"
    After visiting the model of the National Theater designed by Chinese students, Comrade Pak Chong-ae told us that a theater with a capacity of two thousand spectators would soon be built on Stalin Avenue in Pyongyang, our homeland. She also said that our theater should be as beautiful as the National Theater in Beijing. She also encouraged us to study hard.
    When we arrived at the local power plant, we introduced to Foreign Minister Nam Il: "This power plant did not build a new building, but used a dilapidated temple, a local method." The Foreign Minister said, "Very good." He also praised the comprehensive utilization of coal, which produces both electricity and tar, with many products, without wasting any raw materials. Marshal Kim Il-sung was also very satisfied with this local power plant. He said to the Minister of Education: "This power station can not only be used for learning and production, but also for scientific research. This method is worth studying."
    The three-hour visit ended quickly. We were really reluctant to leave the government delegation. The leaders' kind care and valuable instructions will be firmly remembered in our hearts, always encouraging us. We are determined to strengthen the friendship and unity between the youths of Korea and China, and to answer the Party's training and the Chinese people's hopes with our greatest efforts. We must, like the university students of our homeland, ride on the Chollima and attack the fortress of science! (Attached picture)

    我们渡过了难忘的一天
    清华大学土木系朝鲜留学生　金致谦
    一听到我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅将重访清华园的消息后，我们几个朝鲜同学激动极了。欣喜的心情真是难以形容。
    前一天的晚上，大家聚集在一起，说这说那，谈得很晚很晚，谁也不愿早睡，三个月前，我们曾回过祖国欢度暑假，暑假的见闻很自然地成了我们谈话的内容。我们曾见到平壤的建设，见到劳动人民冲天的干劲，还见到祖国的大学生在参加生产劳动，教育和生产正逐渐结合……但是，在别后的三个月里，祖国的千里马更飞快地向社会主义和共产主义前进。当我们每天读到“劳动新闻”的时候，知道新制的火车，新制的汽车，新制的挖土机……像雨后春笋似的不断出现，怎能叫人不兴奋？不激动？隔一天，敬爱的领袖就会来到我们身旁，这将是我们一生最幸福的时候。于是，我们每个人都在想：怎样来报答党和领袖的关怀呢？怎样使自己更快地成为社会主义和共产主义的建设者呢？尤其是我们用什么样的成绩来向祖国汇报呢？
    夜里，很多人兴奋得睡不着，第二天一清早，连早饭也不吃就到二教室楼门口，等待敬爱的金日成元帅。十点多钟，道路两旁的中国同学们欢呼起来了，人们热情地鼓掌，拼命地喊着：“欢迎金日成首相！”这时，金日成首相、周恩来总理并肩走来，他们含着微笑，向夹道欢迎的群众频频招手致意。我们朝鲜留学生的狂喜的心情和欢呼，就更加热烈、更加响亮了，不少同学激动得热泪盈眶，仿佛整个的祖国，都将我们拥抱。
    我们陪着敬爱的领袖一起参观了我们的学校，金日成元帅十分亲切地问起我们的学习和生活。他说：“你们学习得怎么样？能不能更多更好地学习先进的科学技术来建设我们的祖国？”我们齐声回答说：“能！有了党和您的教导，有中国党和学校的热情帮助，怎么不能？一定要完成我们的学习任务。”他满意地笑了，并向我们说：“对，应该好好地学习，中国的半工半读好得很！既能学习，又能生产，而且还搞科学研究！”
    参观了中国同学设计的国家剧院模型之后，朴正爱同志对我们说，在祖国平壤的斯大林大街上，马上要建起一座容纳二千观众的大剧院。她还说，我们的大剧院也要像北京的国家剧院一样漂亮。她又勉励我们好好学习。
    到了土电厂。我们向南日外务相介绍说：“这个电厂没有盖新房，利用破庙，土办法。”外务相说：“很好。”他还夸奖燃煤的综合利用，又出电又出焦油，产品很多，不浪费一点原料。金日成元帅也十分满意这个土电厂，他对教育相说：“这个电站既可以学习和生产，又可以搞科学研究，这个办法值得我们研究。”
    三个多小时的参观很快地结束了，我们真舍不得离开政府代表团，领袖们亲切的关怀，宝贵的指示，将牢牢记在我们心中，永远鼓舞着我们。我们决心加强朝中两国青年的友谊和团结，用最大的努力来回答党的培养和中国人民的希望，要像祖国的大学生一样跨上千里马，向科学堡垒进攻！（附图片）
