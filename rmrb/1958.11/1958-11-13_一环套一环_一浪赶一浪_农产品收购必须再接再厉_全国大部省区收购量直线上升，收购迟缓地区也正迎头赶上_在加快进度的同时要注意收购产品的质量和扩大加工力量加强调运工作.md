Xinhua News Agency, November 12th—Since entering November, significant achievements have been made in the national agricultural product procurement work. Among the twenty-five provinces and autonomous regions nationwide, nineteen have comprehensively or partially launched a high tide of agricultural product procurement. The procurement volume of some agricultural products has risen sharply, and regions with slower progress are catching up. It is expected that in the second half of November, an even more powerful procurement high tide will appear.

According to incomplete statistics: As of November 9th, more than 28 million dan of cotton had been purchased nationwide, completing 44.2% of the annual procurement task, an increase of 82% compared to the procurement volume in the same period last year. Since the 7th, the average daily grain procurement volume has reached about 1 billion jin, an increase of one and a half times compared to the daily procurement volume in late October. As of the 9th, the number of grains stored nationwide has completed 33.5% of the production year plan. 5.65 million dan of flue-cured tobacco has been purchased, more than double the amount in the same period last year.

Some regions have begun to pay attention to the processing and transportation of agricultural products while strengthening the procurement work. Some regions have requested that people's communes organize specialized processing teams to engage specifically in the processing of agricultural products. For example, in the Shangqiu Special District of Henan Province, not only have all of the existing 7,900 cotton gins been organized and put into production, but also attention has been paid to tapping potential, and the 900 cotton gins that were previously discarded have been repaired and used, greatly increasing the processing capacity of the entire region. Hunan Province has solved the problem of insufficient short-distance transportation by establishing transportation corps, mobilizing the masses to carry out shock transport, and mobilizing cadres attending meetings to carry goods, transporting many goods to traffic routes in a timely manner. Various places have also used the "ants moving a mountain" method to solve the transportation problems of many materials.

Responsible officials from relevant departments of the State Council told our reporter that although the agricultural product procurement work has achieved great results under the attention of the local party committees and the support of the broad masses, the development of the movement is still very uneven. From a regional perspective, the progress of the procurement movement in a small number of regions is relatively slow due to the late harvest season of crops and the lack of proper organization of labor. From a variety perspective, the progress of cash crops is faster, while the progress of grains is slower; among cash crops, cotton is faster, and tobacco leaves are slower. Comparing procurement with processing and transportation, procurement is better, while processing and transportation are worse. Therefore, all localities should vigorously grasp the procurement of varieties with poor procurement, especially the procurement of grains, which should be vigorously strengthened. Some regions with slow progress in the movement should also take effective measures to quickly catch up. At the same time, it should be recognized that China has a vast territory, and the climate in the north and south is very different. The maturity seasons of various agricultural products in various places are not consistent, and the processing and transportation conditions in various places are also different. It is impossible to completely seek balance in the movement. Therefore, the agricultural product procurement movement is not a sprint that is over in a few days, and the large movement nested in small movements is not a one-time thing, but must move forward continuously, one ring after another, one wave surpassing another. The duration of this movement is relatively long. Those regions that have completed or are close to completing the procurement task must continue to use the method of large movements nested in small movements, combining regular work with shock movements, to do a good job in a series of tasks such as processing, transportation, storage, and supply, so that these tasks also have more "satellites" launched. At the same time, it must be recognized that even if the task is completed, one should not be satisfied with the existing achievements. All agricultural products that the people's communes should sell should be purchased.

The official said that while grasping the progress of agricultural product procurement, all localities should pay attention to the quality of agricultural products. According to reports from several provinces, a considerable portion of the agricultural products currently purchased are of low quality and have high moisture content. In individual areas, spoilage has occurred. Although this situation is difficult to avoid in the early stages of the movement, it will cause significant losses if attention is not paid to it early. If more labor is mobilized to re-dry the grain after it is put into storage, it will also be detrimental to production this winter and next spring. Therefore, local party committees are required to educate the people's communes to not only sell more and sell faster, but also to sell good grains, and to carry out the work of sorting and drying before the grains are put into storage, as much as possible to dry and clean the grain. Grain departments should strengthen storage work after the grain is put into storage to avoid losses to the fruits of the harvest.

The official finally said that it is still necessary to vigorously strengthen the transportation of agricultural products, and in particular, to immediately eliminate the phenomenon of "vehicles without goods," which causes a waste of vehicles. Under the situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in China, the situation of "goods waiting for vehicles" is inevitable and understandable, while "vehicles without goods" is abnormal and wrong. The financial and trade departments in various places can consider establishing transportation headquarters to direct the scheduling of goods like combat, connecting short-distance transportation with long-distance transportation, so that transportation work can quickly catch up with the needs of procurement and supply.

### 一环套一环　一浪赶一浪  农产品收购必须再接再厉  全国大部省区收购量直线上升，收购迟缓地区也正迎头赶上  在加快进度的同时要注意收购产品的质量和扩大加工力量加强调运工作

    一环套一环　一浪赶一浪
    农产品收购必须再接再厉
    全国大部省区收购量直线上升，收购迟缓地区也正迎头赶上
    在加快进度的同时要注意收购产品的质量和扩大加工力量加强调运工作
    新华社12日讯　进入11月份以来，全国农产品收购工作取得显著成绩。全国二十五个省、自治区中，已有十九个全面或部分地掀起了农产品收购高潮，部分农产品的收购量直线上升，运动进展迟缓的地区也正在迎头赶上。预计11月下半月，一个声势更加浩大的收购高潮将会出现。
    据不完全统计：截至11月9日，全国已购棉二千八百多万担，完成全年收购任务的44.2％，比去年同期的收购量增加了82％；粮食自7日以后平均日收量已达十亿斤左右，比10月下旬的日收量增加一倍半；截至9日，全国粮食入库数已完成生产年度计划的33.5％；烤烟已收购五百六十五万担，比去年同期增加两倍多。
    部分地区在加强农产品收购工作的同时，开始注意到农产品的加工和调运工作。有些地区要求人民公社组织专业加工队专门进行农产品加工工作。如河南省商丘专区，不仅将现有的七千九百多部轧花机全部组织起来投入生产，并且注意挖掘潜力，将过去废弃了的九百部轧花机也加以修配使用，使全区加工能力大大提高。湖南省通过建立运输兵团，发动群众进行突击运输、动员开会的干部携带货物等多种办法，解决了短途运输力不足的问题，把许多货物及时运到交通沿线。各地还用“蚂蚁搬泰山”的办法解决了很多物资的运输问题。
    国务院有关方面负责人对本社记者说，目前农产品收购工作虽然在各地党委重视和广大群众支持下，取得了很大成绩，但是运动的发展仍然很不平衡。从地区看，还有少数地区的收购运动由于农作物收获季节较晚和劳动力组织不够妥善等原因，进展比较迟缓；从品种看，经济作物进度较快，粮食较慢；经济作物中棉花较快、烟叶较慢；以收购和加工调运比较，收购较好、加工调运较差。因此，各地对收购情况不好的品种，要大力抓紧收购，特别是粮食的收购，应该大力加强；一些运动进展较迟缓的地区也应当采取有效措施，迅速迎头赶上去。同时，应该看到我国地区辽阔，南北方气候相差很远，各地各种农产品成熟的季节不一致，各地加工、运输的条件也不一样，要完全求得运动的平衡也是不可能的。因此农产品收购运动不是突击几天就过去了，大运动套小运动也不是套一次就算了，而是要一环套一环，一浪赶一浪地不断前进。这个运动的时间是比较长的，那些已经完成或接近完成收购任务的地区必须继续用大运动套小运动，经常工作和突击运动相结合的办法，做好加工、调运、保管、供应等一系列工作，使这些工作中也有更多的“卫星”上天。同时必须认识到：即使完成任务，也不应该满足已有的成绩。凡是人民公社应该出售的农产品，都应该收购起来。
    负责人说，各地在抓农产品收购进度的同时，应该注意到农产品的质量问题。据若干省反映，目前已收购的农产品有相当一部分质量不高，水分较大，个别地区发生霉烂变质现象，这种情况在运动初期虽然是难以避免的，但是如不及早注意，将会造成很大的损失。如果等入库以后再来翻晒，就要动员更多的劳动力，对今冬明春的生产也是不利的。因此要求各地党委教育人民公社不仅要多卖、快卖，而且要卖出好粮食，在粮食入库前进行整晒工作，尽可能做到晒干扬净。粮食部门在粮食入库后应该加强保管工作，以免丰收果实受到损失。
    负责人最后说，目前还必须大力加强农产品的调运工作，特别要立即消灭“有车无货”因而造成车辆浪费的现象。在我国工农业生产大跃进的形势下，“有货等车”的情况是必然的，也是可以理解的，而“有车无货”则是反常的、错误的。各地财贸部门可以考虑建立运输指挥部，像作战一样地指挥货物的调度，把短途运输和长途运输衔接起来，使调运工作迅速赶上收购和供应的需要。
