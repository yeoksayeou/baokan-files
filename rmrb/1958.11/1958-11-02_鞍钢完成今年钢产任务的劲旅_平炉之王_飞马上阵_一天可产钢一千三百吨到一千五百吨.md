Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 1st. One of the two largest open-hearth furnaces currently built by Ansteel has been put into production ahead of schedule on the 31st, producing high-quality steel; the other will also be completed and produce steel soon.

At 11:40 pm on the 31st, steelworkers, full of excitement, opened the tapping spout under the tense and concerned gazes of hundreds of pairs of eyes. In an instant, golden, dazzling molten steel surged and roared, flowing out along three tapping spouts and pouring into three large ladles. Thunderous applause erupted from the steelworkers and the visiting crowd. Firecrackers exploded and songs rang out in front of the open-hearth furnace as people warmly celebrated the birth of this world's "King of Open Hearth Furnaces."

This giant open-hearth furnace was put into production at 12:30 pm on the 31st. From charging to tapping, it only took 11 hours and 10 minutes, which is nearly one hour shorter than planned.

This open-hearth furnace is the fourth large fixed open-hearth furnace that Ansteel has completed and put into production this year. After normal production, it can produce 1,300 to 1,500 tons of steel per day. This open-hearth furnace is not only large in capacity but also technologically advanced. During its construction, the original design was modified, and the new three-spout tapping technology from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was adopted, which increased steel production by 32% compared with the original design without increasing equipment and investment. Its charging and heating systems also absorbed the latest technological achievements in the world.

The design and construction of this large open-hearth furnace were all carried out by Chinese workers. Its complete set of equipment, including giant cranes with a lifting capacity of nearly 300 tons and various automatic control equipment, are also manufactured by China itself.

According to the original plan, this open-hearth furnace was to be put into production in April next year; encouraged by the general line of socialist construction, the workers established a communist style of daring to think and daring to act, broke the old construction procedures, and adopted a parallel and cross-operation construction method. The construction period was repeatedly advanced. Finally, it took only four months and twenty-odd days to complete this giant open-hearth furnace, two quarters ahead of the original plan. Its early completion is a powerful support for Ansteel to overfulfill the task of 4.5 million tons of steel this year. (Attached picture)

    鞍钢完成今年钢产任务的劲旅
    “平炉之王”飞马上阵
    一天可产钢一千三百吨到一千五百吨
    新华社鞍山1日电　鞍钢建设的目前世界上最大的两座平炉，有一座已在31日提前投入生产，炼出了质量优良的钢；另外一座也将很快建成出钢。
    31日深夜十一点四十分，兴致勃勃的炼钢工人，在几百双眼睛紧张关切的注视下，打开了出钢口。刹那间，金光耀眼的钢水，翻腾咆哮着顺着三个出钢槽滚滚流出，倾泻在三个大钢水罐里。在炼钢工人和前来参观的人群中间，顿时响起了雷鸣般的掌声。平炉前边鞭炮齐鸣，歌声嘹亮，人们热烈地庆祝这座世界“平炉之王”的诞生。
    这座巨型平炉是在31日中午十二点三十分投入生产的，从装料到出钢，只用了十一小时零十分钟，比计划时间缩短了将近一个小时。
    这座平炉是鞍钢今年建成投入生产的第四座大型固定式平炉，生产正常后，一天可以产钢一千三百吨到一千五百吨。这座平炉不仅容量大，技术也先进。它在建设过程中修改了原来设计，采用了太原钢铁厂三槽出钢的新技术，因而在不增加设备和投资的情况下，使钢产量比原设计提高了32％。它的装料、热工系统，也都吸收了世界最新技术成就。
    这座大型平炉的设计和施工，全部是由我国职工进行的。它的全套设备，包括起重能力近三百吨的巨型吊车、各种自动控制设备，也都是我国自己制造的。
    按照原计划，这座平炉要在明年4月投入生产；由于职工们在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，树立了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，打破了旧的施工程序，采取了平行交叉作业的施工方法，工期一再提前，终于比原计划提前了两个季度，只用了四个月零二十多天的时间，就建成这座巨型平炉，它的提前建成，对鞍钢今年超额完成四百五十万吨钢的任务，是一个强有力的支援。（附图片）
