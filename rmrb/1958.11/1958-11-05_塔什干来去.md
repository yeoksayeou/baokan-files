    Going to and from Tashkent
    Zhang Geng
    Tashkent is a beautiful city. I had heard about this city on the Chinese broadcast of Moscow Radio, and the successful description by the broadcaster added to my yearning for it. This time I actually met it. It is much more beautiful than I expected. Its warm sunshine, its poplar trees, its delicious melons and fruits, the red, green, large, small, countless kinds of grapes, these are all unforgettable, but what is most unforgettable are the people there, the enthusiastic people, the people with deep friendship!
    One day late at night, I came back from watching a play, feeling a little tired. I got off the bus and walked through the crowd towards the hotel gate. Suddenly, a rose flashed before my eyes, and I immediately smelled a refreshing sweetness, my fatigue disappeared. A beautiful little girl of five or six years old spoke to me in a very proud tone:
      "You are Chinese, I know!" As she said this, she stuffed the flower into my hand.
    I didn't understand Russian. By the time I had figured out the meaning of these words, she had already disappeared into the crowd. I found a Sino-Soviet friendship badge in my pocket and wanted to put it on her, but it was too late. With great difficulty, I spotted her in the distance of the crowd, already being picked up by her mother (I believe that must have been her mother). Her mother, like her, looked back at me with a proud smile, and left the crowd.
    The little girl was very proud because she had not mistaken a Chinese person, she had successfully conveyed friendship; her mother was also very proud that her young daughter could do a great thing and convey the friendship between the people of the two countries; but I was very sorry that I was unable to give that little girl a small gift that expressed the great friendship.
    I have been wondering, where does this deep friendship come from? This feeling of friendship does not only exist in the hearts of a few people, nor does it only exist in the hearts of more people. When I talk to some Chinese people who have been to the Soviet Union, without exception, everyone has this common feeling. This cannot but be said that it exists universally in the hearts of the broad masses of people of China and the Soviet Union. How did it penetrate into the hearts of the 900 million people of our two great nations?
    On October 18, 1958, it was almost dark, but we still drove to a large dam near Andijan to visit. This dam, together with a canal, is the first large-scale water conservancy project in this area of Central Asia. In Uzbekistan, water is such an important thing! In the old days, landlords and the ruling class not only seized the land, but also seized the water; after the October Revolution, water, along with the land, was returned to the peasants. The state also vigorously mobilized peasants to build water conservancy projects, build dams, and dig canals.
    We went up to the dam, and the night enveloped us. The buildings only showed their great outlines in the darkness. How quiet! But the comrade explaining told us that it was not like this during the construction. At that time, how many laborers worked here day and night, how many machines roared here, and how many electric lights illuminated this place! Now who can imagine it? Such a quiet place was originally a white-hot battlefield. At that time, many literary and art groups came to perform, and film teams came to show movies. It became a world of labor in itself. This is how they worked for forty-five days, and the dam and canal that will forever benefit the people of Central Asia were completed. These explanations could not help but remind me of the scene when we built the Ming Tombs Reservoir not long ago: Wasn't the construction site of the Ming Tombs also a white-hot battlefield at that time? Didn't our literary and art workers: writers and playwrights also go there in batches to perform plays, dance, recite, and write poems? Wasn't it also a world of labor filled with enthusiasm for building socialism? In these aspects, our spiritual outlook and that of the Soviet people are so similar!
    On October 26th, we finally said goodbye to the Soviet Union and flew back to our motherland. When the plane slowly descended from an altitude of three thousand meters to several hundred meters, I clearly saw the whole view of the Ming Tombs Reservoir. It was no longer the way it was when we were working hard, the water had filled the entire reservoir, the lake surface was already very vast, and even at the speed of the plane, it took two full minutes to reach the dam. The words inscribed by Chairman Mao emitted a dazzling light in the sun.
    In that instant, I recalled the scene when we were guests at a collective farm in Uzbekistan: the host's warm smile and the Uzbek wine he held in his hand, and the close and intimate conversations around the dining table... Really, why are the words of both Chinese and Soviet people so enthusiastic and moving at every such gathering? There is no other reason, this is a gathering of close brothers, although individually speaking, they may be meeting for the first time. But, what does it matter?
    I went to Tashkent with full enthusiasm; I came back with double the enthusiasm of Soviet friends.

### 塔什干来去

    塔什干来去
    张庚
    塔什干是一个美丽的城市。关于这个城市的事，我曾经在莫斯科电台的中文广播中听到过，由于广播员成功的描述，更增加了我对于它的向往。这回我居然和它见了面。它比我预期的要美丽得多。它温暖的阳光，它的白杨树，它的鲜美的瓜果，红的、绿的、大的、小的、数不尽种类的葡萄，这些都令人难于忘记，但是最令人难于忘记的是那里的人，热情的人，友谊深厚的人！
    有一天深夜，我看完戏回来，感到有些疲倦了，下了车，从人丛中走向旅馆的大门去。忽然在我的眼前有一朵玫瑰花一晃，随即闻到一股沁人的甜香，我的疲倦消逝了。有一个五六岁的美丽的小姑娘用一种非常得意的口吻朝我说话：
      “你是中国人，我知道！”说着，就把花塞到我的手里。
    我不懂俄文，当我把这几个字的意义琢磨清楚之后，她已经钻进人丛里去了。我从兜里找到一个中苏友好的徽章想给她戴上，但已经迟了。好容易在人丛的远处发现她已经被她妈妈抱起。（我相信那一定是她的妈妈）她的妈妈也和她一样，用一种得意的笑容回头望了我一眼，走出人群去了。
    小女孩很得意，因为她没有认错中国人，她把友谊成功地传达了；她的妈妈也很得意，她的幼小的女儿能够办一件大事，传达了两个国家人民之间的友谊；可是我很遗憾，终于没有能够将一件表现伟大友谊的微小礼物送给那个小女孩。
    我一直在想，这种深厚的友情到底从何而来呢？这种友谊之感不只是存在在少数人心中，也不只是存在在较多的人心中，就我和一些到过苏联的中国人谈起来，毫无例外的，大家都有这种共同的感觉，这就不能不说，它是普遍地存在在中苏两国广大人民的心中。它是怎样渗透到我们两大民族的九万万人的心里去的呢？
    1958年10月18日，天已经快黑了，但是我们还是乘汽车赶到了安集延附近的一个大水坝去参观。这个水坝连同一条运河，是中亚这一带的第一个大水利工程。在乌兹别克，水是多么重要的东西啊！从前旧时代，地主和统治阶级不仅仅霸占了土地，而且还霸占了水；十月革命后，和土地同时，也将水交回到农民手里。国家还大力地动员农民兴修水利，建筑水坝，开挖运河。
    我们上了堤坝，夜色笼罩着我们，建筑物只在黑暗中显示出伟大的轮廓。多么安静！但是说明的同志告诉我们，在建设的当时却不是如此。那时有多少民工在这里夜以继日的工作，有多少机器在这里轰轰作响口有多少电灯把这里照得通亮！现在谁能想得到呢？如此安静的地方，那时原来是一个白热的战斗场所。那时候，也有许多文艺团体来演出，电影队来放映，这里自成了一个劳动的世界。就这样干了四十五天，这座永远造福中亚人民的水坝和运河完成了。这些说明不由得我不想起前不久我们修十三陵水库的情景：当时的十三陵工地上难道不也是一个白热的战场么？我们的文艺工作者：作家们、戏剧家们不也是成批成队地到那里去演戏、跳舞、朗诵、写诗的么？那里不也是一个高涨着建设社会主义热情的劳动世界么？在这些方面，我们和苏联人民的精神面貌是多么相近啊！
    10月26日，我们终于告别了苏联，飞回祖国来了。当飞机从三千公尺的高度慢慢下降到几百公尺的时候，我清楚地看到了十三陵水库的全貌。那里已经不是我们紧张劳动时的样子了，水已经涨满了整个水库，湖面已经很辽阔，就是用飞机的速度也足足过了两分钟才走到大坝上。毛主席题的字在阳光下发出耀眼的光亮。
    这一刹那间，我又回想起在乌兹别克集体农庄作客时候的情景来：主人的殷勤的笑脸和他手中举着的乌兹别克产的葡萄酒、还有那些餐桌边亲切无间的交谈……真的，为什么在每一次这样的聚会上，无论是中国人、无论是苏联人，他们的话都是那么热情动人呢？没有别的，这是亲兄弟的聚会，虽然就个人来说，他们也许还是初次见面。但是，这有什么关系呢？
    我怀着满腔热情到塔什干；我带着加倍的苏联朋友的热情回来。
