Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th. Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" published an article on the 14th entitled "U.S. Troops Leave Another Blood Debt in Taiwan," based on materials from Taiwanese newspapers, revealing that American soldiers in Taiwan have committed another extremely brutal rape and murder case. The murderer in this case was U.S. Army Corporal Wiltz, and the victim was a Taiwanese woman about 20 years old.

Taiwanese newspapers have recently revealed the truth of this murder case and said that the murderer has been escorted back to the United States by the "United States Taiwan Defense Command." Taiwanese compatriots are very angry after hearing this news and have demanded that the Taiwan authorities negotiate with the United States to bring the murderer to justice.

"Ta Kung Pao" said that on July 8th of this year, a bound, naked female corpse was found in a bamboo forest in Muzha Township, a suburb of Taipei City, placed in a black plastic bag used exclusively by the U.S. military. According to forensic examination, the deceased was a woman about 20 years old, with two blunt-force trauma injuries to the head and strangulation marks on the neck, a gruesome death. Based on the body and the scene, the deceased was raped and murdered, and then the murderer used a jeep to transport the body to the bamboo forest and abandon it. Three copies of the English-language "China Post" published in Taiwan were also found near the corpse.

The news said that after several months of investigation, the Taiwan police authorities confirmed that the woman was raped and killed by U.S. Army Corporal Wiltz. When Taiwanese newspapers published news of the discovery of the unidentified female corpse in July, Wiltz immediately left his residence in Taipei and went into hiding, but was eventually found by the Taiwan police authorities, who obtained both witness testimony and material evidence confirming that Wiltz was the murderer. The U.S. military-only plastic bag used to carry the body and the "China Post" left behind were also Wiltz's belongings. However, this American murderer, relying on the so-called "privileges" enjoyed by the U.S. military in Taiwan, "refused to answer any questions" when the Taiwan police interrogated him, "especially when asked about important and critical points."

"Ta Kung Pao" said that what is particularly infuriating is that the murderer who raped and killed the woman has now "legally left the country" and escaped back to the United States. The U.S. military command in Taiwan, based on the "privileges" enjoyed by the U.S. military in Taiwan, has taken the murderer from the hands of the Taiwan police authorities and sheltered him to "legally leave the country," just like a year and a half ago when it sheltered U.S. soldier Reynolds, the murderer of Liu Ziran, and allowed him to leave the country.

"Ta Kung Pao" pointed out that since the U.S. military occupied Taiwan for several years, countless Taiwanese compatriots have been ravaged and killed by the U.S. military. In particular, Taiwanese women are at risk of being kidnapped, insulted, murdered, and having their bodies discarded to cover up the crimes at any time. Under the rampage of American soldiers, the disappearance of Taiwanese women is a daily occurrence. The Muzha female corpse case is just one of the countless murders committed by the U.S. military in Taiwan. The atrocities of American soldiers have made the anti-American anger of the Taiwanese people more and more intense.

### 又是一笔血债  侵台美军奸杀我国妇女  凶手竟被美军司令部护送离境

    又是一笔血债
    侵台美军奸杀我国妇女  凶手竟被美军司令部护送离境
    新华社广州18日电　香港“大公报”14日以“美军在台又留一笔血债”为题，根据台湾报纸的材料，揭露美国兵在台湾又干了一件极尽凶暴残酷的强奸杀人案件。这个案子的凶手是美军下士威尔兹，被杀害的是一个年约二十岁的台湾妇女。
    台湾各报最近透露了这一凶杀案的真相，并且说凶手已经被“美国台湾防卫司令部”护送回美国。台湾同胞听到这个消息后都非常愤怒，纷纷要求台湾当局向美国交涉，追凶归案。
    “大公报”说，今年7月8日，在台北市郊区木栅乡的一个竹林中，发现了一具被捆缚的无名裸体女尸，放在一个美军专用的黑色胶布袋里面。经法医检验，死者是一个年约二十岁的妇女，头部有两处被钝器击破的伤痕，脖子上也有被抑窒的痕迹，死状极惨。根据尸体和现场判断，死者是在被奸污遇害后，被凶手用吉普车把尸体运到竹林里抛弃的。尸体附近还发现有三张台湾出版的英文“中国邮报”。
    消息说，台湾的警察当局经过几个月的侦查，证实这个妇女是被美军下士威尔兹强奸后杀死的。当台湾报纸在7月间刊出发现这个无名女尸的消息后，威尔兹立刻离开他在台北的住所，藏匿起来，但终于被台湾警察当局找到，并且获得了人证和物证，证实了威尔兹是杀人凶犯。而装载女尸的美军专用胶布袋和遗下的“中国邮报”等，也都是威尔兹的物品。可是，这个美国杀人凶手竟恃美军在台湾享有所谓“特权”，在台湾警方盘问他的时候，“询至重要关键处”，他竟“一概拒绝作答”。
    “大公报”说，尤其令人愤慨的是，这个奸杀妇女的凶手，现在竟已“依法离境”，逃回美国去了。侵台美军司令部根据美军在台湾享受的“特权”，已经把这个凶手从台湾警察当局的手里接过去，并且庇护他“依法离境”。就像一年半以前庇护杀害刘自然的凶手美国兵雷诺出境一样。
    “大公报”指出，美军侵占台湾数年以来，台湾同胞遭受美军蹂躏杀害者不计其数。尤其是台湾妇女，随时有被美军绑架、污辱、杀害、弃尸灭迹的可能。在美国兵横行霸道下，台湾妇女失踪的事，日日皆有。木栅女尸案只是美军在台湾无数杀人罪行之一。美国兵的兽行使台湾人民的反美怒火一天比一天更加炽烈。
