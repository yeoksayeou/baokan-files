A Hundred Flowers Bloom, A Myriad Purples Reflect a Thousand Reds
Mass Culture Network Spreads Throughout Urban and Rural Areas

    (Reported by this newspaper) Along with the Great Leap Forward in production, mass cultural activities have also seen an unprecedented flourishing. Various mass cultural organizations are springing up like mushrooms after rain, increasing rapidly. According to incomplete statistics as of August, more than 1,019,000 clubs have been established in cities and rural areas across the country, an increase of 329% compared to 1957; more than 434,700 amateur performing arts troupes and amateur theater troupes have been established; more than 473,800 commune-run libraries (reading rooms) have been established, an increase of 264% compared to 1957; more than 51,900 cultural stations have been established, an increase of 21 times compared to 1957; and more than 22,700 cultural centers have been established, an increase of eight times compared to 1957. A mass-based cultural network covering the entire country has taken shape.

    The Great Leap Forward in mass cultural activities is first manifested in the widespread popularity of various activities. Xiyang County in Shanxi Province has established 831 clubs, popularizing more than a dozen literary and artistic activities among the entire population, including singing, creative writing, art schools, exhibitions, publishing, drama, wall paintings, paper cutting, lantern shows, books, storytelling, dance, and broadcasting. Out of the county's population of over 160,000, more than 145,000 can sing, more than 55,000 can act, and more than 110,000 can create, having already created more than three million works; there are more than 35,000 mass painters who have painted more than 360,000 wall paintings throughout the county. The Great Leap Forward in mass cultural activities is also manifested in the wide scope of mass cultural activities. Not only are young people participating in activities, but also elderly women, elderly men, children, and even kindergarten children are participating in various cultural activities. For example, Nanma People's Commune in Lishui County, Zhejiang Province, has a "Cowherd Team," Huanggu People's Commune in Pinghu County has a "Grandpa Team," and Chengguan Town in Sheng County has a "Children's Team." There are also many families participating in cultural activities as a whole. In Lei Tiancai's family in Guanfeng Township, Leping County, Jiangxi, four generations of grandparents, parents, children, and grandchildren formed an amateur theater troupe. Many grassroots units are now almost at the point where everyone can write, everyone can paint, everyone can sing, and everyone can act. In extensive mass cultural activities, a large number of outstanding worker-peasant amateur authors have emerged. According to incomplete statistics, there are already more than 1,029,500 mass creation groups across the country (excluding Beijing, Tianjin, Xinjiang, and Henan), creating countless works.

    The Leap Forward in production has driven the Leap Forward in mass cultural work, and the Leap Forward in cultural work closely serves production, promoting production. In mass cultural activities, the masses have also created many new forms of cultural activities to cooperate with and promote production. For example, the "Red Flag Halls" (Red Flag Stages, Red Flag Boards) that have been widely established in Fujian and other places mainly display new industrial and agricultural products, new records, new inventions, and the deeds of various advanced figures. The objects and photos displayed in the hall can be changed at any time; whoever has new inventions, whoever breaks records, and whose deeds can enter the Red Flag Hall. The Red Flag Hall has become a review platform for comparing advancements, comparing achievements, and launching satellites. It inspires people's fighting spirit and promotes the Leap Forward in various tasks. The Zhongling Club in Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, moved the luminous newspaper with lights inside and calligraphy and paintings outside to the fields for night battles, which not only illuminated the fields but also played a propaganda role and became an insecticidal lamp.

    "Production is tight, culture keeps up." With the continuous Leap Forward in production, mass cultural activities will also show a more beautiful and better face. After the National Cultural Administration Conference, under the guidance of continuing to implement the policy of cultural popularization, mass cultural activities will usher in a new upsurge.

    百花齐开放　万紫映千红
    群众文化网遍布全国城乡
    本报讯　随着生产大跃进，群众文化活动也出现了空前繁荣的景象。各种群众文化活动组织如雨后春笋，飞速增加。据截至8月份止的不完全统计，全国城市和农村的俱乐部已建一百零一万九千多个，比1957年增长329％；业余文工团和业余剧团已建四十三万四千七百多个，社办图书馆（室）有四十七万三千八百多个，比1957年增长264％；文化站有五万一千九百多个，比1957年增长二十一倍；文化馆有二万二千七百多个，比1957年增长八倍。遍布全国的群众性的文化网已经形成。
    群众文化活动大跃进，首先表现在各种活动的大普及上。山西昔阳县已经建立了八百三十一个俱乐部，在全民中普及了歌唱、创作、艺校、展览、出版、戏剧、墙画、剪纸、幻灯、图书、说唱、舞蹈和广播等十几项文艺活动。全县十六万余人口中，能歌唱的有十四万五千多人，能演戏的有五万五千多人，有十一万多人能创作，已经创作了三百多万件；有群众画家三万五千多人，在全县画了三十六万多幅墙画。群众文化活动大跃进，还表现在群众文化活动的广泛性上。不仅是青年人参加活动，老大娘、老大爷、少年儿童，以及幼儿园的娃娃也都参加了各种文化活动。像浙江省丽水县南马人民公社有“牧童队”，平湖县黄姑人民公社有“爷爷队”，嵊县城关镇有娃娃队。还有许多人一家子都参加文化活动。江西乐平县观峰乡雷天才家，祖孙四代组成一个业余剧团。许多基层已差不多是全民能写、全民能画、全民能唱、全民能演。在广泛的群众文化活动中，已经涌现出数量极多的出色的工农业余作者，据不完全的统计，全国已有群众创作组一百零二万九千五百多个（未包括北京、天津、新疆、河南）创作了难以数计的作品。
    生产跃进带动了群众文化工作的跃进，文化工作的跃进又紧紧服务于生产，推进了生产。在群众文化活动中，群众还创造了许多配合生产推动生产的新的文化活动形式。像福建等地已经广泛建立的“红旗馆”（红旗台、红旗榜），陈列的内容主要是工农业的新产品、新纪录和新的创造发明，以及各种先进人物事迹。馆中展出的实物和照片，可以随时更换，谁有新的创造发明，谁把纪录刷新，谁的事迹就可以进红旗馆。红旗馆成了比先进、比战绩、放卫星的检阅台。它鼓舞着人们的斗志，推动了各项工作跃进。江西兴国县中岭俱乐部把内有灯光、外有字画的夜光报搬到夜战的田间，既照了明，又起了宣传作用，还成了灭虫灯。
    “生产紧张，文化跟上”，随着生产的不断跃进，群众文化活动也将出现更美更好的面貌。在全国文化行政会议后，在继续贯彻文化大普及的方针指导之下，群众文化活动，更将出现一个新的高潮。（附图片）
