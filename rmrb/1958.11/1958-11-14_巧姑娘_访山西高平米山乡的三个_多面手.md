Clever Girls
    ——Visiting Three "All-Rounders" in Mishan Township, Gaoping, Shanxi
    Ma Ming, Cai Ying
    Many people visiting Mishan Township in the Taihang Mountains of Gaoping County for the first time are captivated by the versatile achievements of the township's three "clever girls." These three clever girls – Communist Party member Song Chou'er and Communist Youth League members Wang Leping and Li Chunhua – average only twenty-one years old and only studied in a literacy crash course for one year. However, they have now become "all-rounders" familiar with more than twenty techniques in industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. They have not only learned sewing, embroidery, and paper-cutting, which are skills common among rural women, but they have also learned to operate a double-wheeled, double-share plow for cultivation, can operate and repair coal-fired steam engines, gas engines, and diesel engines, can use drilling machines to dig wells, and can graft fruit trees, raise bees, feed pigs, and raise chickens. They also know how to treat corn borers, artificially pollinate, thin seedlings, and weed – they can do all kinds of farm work. Recently, they also learned the technique of indigenous iron smelting. They are dexterous and efficient in their work. Every major construction achievement in the township in the past three years has been inseparable from their names. Farmers describe their active participation in turning barren gullies into vegetable gardens by saying: "Treating barren gullies in the spring leads to a bumper harvest in the autumn. With 'clever girls,' there's nothing to worry about."

    Iron Smelting Is Not Mysterious

    Next to the "Eight Girls Iron Smelting Furnace" at the Hegang Iron Plant in Mishan Township, Song Chou'er and Li Chunhua were waving their arms, turning a wooden bellows to smelt iron. A month ago, the two of them came to this factory and, along with six other new "clever girls," have been sticking to the iron smelting furnace day and night.

    Mastering the whole set of indigenous iron smelting techniques, from kneading crucibles and mixing materials to charging and smelting, is not easy. Initially, an earthen furnace for smelting iron was built in one day and night, but charging and smelting techniques stumped them. Song Chou'er consulted an old technical worker, but the response was: you have to pass four tests: kneading crucibles, sealing the air vent, laying the furnace bottom, and observing the fire color. No matter how clever you are, it will take at least three or four years to learn. Song Chou'er was unconvinced. She thought: if that's the case, how can we surpass Britain and catch up with the United States in steel production? She started that night, staying by the furnace, focusing all her attention on observing the technical workers' actions. After two days and nights of careful study and subsequent practical operation and experimentation, she initially mastered the whole set of techniques from kneading crucibles to smelting iron, and finally smelted the first furnace of iron. However, the large amount of labor consumed by kneading crucibles and the intense labor required to use heavy steel tongs and clamps for crucible iron smelting made them think of a new question: could iron smelting be done without crucibles? And reported this idea to the factory leaders. With the help of Qin Haijin, the secretary of the factory's Party branch, they quickly worked out a method of charging the furnace for iron smelting without using crucibles. Using this new smelting method, they have experimented with iron smelting eight times, and the output of each furnace has increased from the original two hundred-odd pounds to six hundred pounds.

    The Story of Learning to Operate a Coal-Fired Steam Engine

    Qin Haijin, the secretary of the Party branch of this iron factory, told us that Song Chou'er and Li Chunhua squeezed out time from their busy iron smelting schedule to repair power machinery for the factory, and also helped train ten new apprentices in operating coal-fired steam engines and gas engines.

    Speaking of operating coal-fired steam engines, Wang Leping, Song Chou'er, and Li Chunhua had this story: In the autumn of last year, Mishan Township had just installed coal-fired steam engines and let them go to the machine room to study first. These rural girls, who had never seen machines before, felt both happy and scared. As soon as they entered the machine room, the rumbling of the machines made them panic, but when they learned about the benefits of machines drawing water for irrigation, they fell in love with the machines.

    Soon after they came to the machine room, it so happened that the machine's water pump broke down, and the coal-fired steam engine operator was very anxious, which made them even more afraid. But they encouraged each other: "Stay calm, we will never leave the machine room until we learn." They thought: we must first be familiar with the coal-fired steam engine before we can master it. So they started with small things, helping the coal-fired steam engine operator to add coal and light the fire, looking around the machine, asking questions when they didn't understand, and learning when they couldn't do it. During breaks, they asked technicians to explain the structural principles of the coal-fired steam engine to them. When others went home to eat and rest, they studied the operation, not even bothering to eat. In this way, in less than half a month, they learned the operation. Soon they learned to repair the machines. From then on, the commune let them be the coal-fired steam engine operators.

    Barren Gullies Become Vegetable Gardens

    We came to the terraced vegetable garden outside the north gate of Mishan, and saw rows of just-watered Chinese cabbage, radishes, and green vegetables, displaying a lush green color. There are two water wells here, and there is a reservoir with abundant water sources on the hill not far from the vegetable garden. Newly planted grape, apple, peach, apricot, pear, and other fruit trees, as well as hundreds of newly propagated bee colonies, make it hard to believe that just over a year ago, this vegetable garden was a weed-infested barren gully.

    Guide Wang Leping said that when developing this vegetable garden, she, Song Chou'er, and Li Chunhua actively participated in the commune's basic farmland construction team and worked together. They worked hard day and night for seventy days, leveling more than two hundred meters long and ten meters high barren hillsides, and blocking the flood channel in the upper part of the barren gully with stones and soil, diverting the flood, and then digging stones and filling soil on the river beach to build this fifteen-mu large, irrigable terraced vegetable garden. Coincidentally, shortly after the completion, there was a heavy rain. Leping, Chou'er, and Chunhua, who were preparing the land in the vegetable garden, saw many people returning home to avoid the rain. They were very uneasy, fearing that the newly built vegetable garden would be washed away by the flood. They stepped on the muddy and difficult road, holding hands and heading straight for the hillside. They and the "Wan Bao Quan" (commune members who can do everything) who rushed to the mountain persisted for five hours in the heavy rain, their clothes were soaked, and they dug a four-zhang long drainage ditch, so that the overflowing flood was diverted into the drainage ditch, maintaining the first water garden born in the whole township. In the first year, a total of 100,000 catties of various vegetables were harvested.

    "Clever Girls" Well

    In a machine room near the vegetable garden, a gas engine drives a waterwheel, causing a torrent of water to be lifted from the well, more than five zhang deep, to the ground and flowing into the vegetable garden.

    This well was dug by the three "clever girls" through hard work, hard study, and fighting against conservative ideas. When the commune director launched the digging of this well, some people objected, saying: "Mishan has never dug a well or grown vegetables. This is hard work that requires great effort, strong technology, and involves dragging mud and water." At this time, Song Chou'er, Wang Leping, and Li Chunhua discussed: "Everyone says that Mishan has never dug wells or grown vegetables for generations. We are Party and League members, and we must do new things that our predecessors have never done, and set an example for everyone!" They took the lead in signing up to participate in well digging. At this time, some men ridiculed: men dare not go down the well, how can women do it? Some old people believed that women digging wells would not produce water, and girls doing this was really inappropriate. Under the support of the Party branch in this township, they were not afraid of the cold weather, not afraid of people laughing at them, took off their shoes and socks, rolled up their trouser legs, worked day and night, and did not complain even if their hands were blistered. When they had dug more than three chi deep, the commune cadres found that their well shaft was not straight, and told them: building socialism cannot rely only on enthusiasm, but more importantly, improving technical level. After they understood the importance of learning technology, they worked hard to study technology, and finally, with the help of "Wan Bao Quan," they mastered a set of complex technologies such as scaffolding, bricklaying, and well digging, and dug this well.

    巧姑娘
    ——访山西高平米山乡的三个“多面手”
    马明　彩英
    很多人初次来到太行山区高平县米山乡的时候，就被这个乡三个“巧姑娘”的多才多艺的事迹迷住了。这三个巧姑娘——共产党员宋丑儿和共青团员王乐平、李春花，平均年龄不过二十一岁，只在扫盲速成班念过一年书，但是，现在已经成为在工农林牧副业方面熟悉二十多种技术的“多面手”了。她们不仅学会了一般农村妇女的缝纫、刺绣、剪花，更学会了操纵双轮双铧犁耕地，会开和修理锅驼机、煤汽机、柴油机，会用钻机打井，会嫁接果树、养蜂、喂猪、养鸡；还会治玉米钻心虫、人工授粉、间苗、锄草这些农活也样样都行。她们最近又学会了土法炼铁的技术，做起活来心灵手巧，又轻快又利索。这个乡三年来的每一项重要建设成就，都和她们的名字分不开。农民形容她们积极参加变荒沟为菜园地的成就时说：“春天治荒沟，秋后大丰收，有了‘巧姑娘’，样样不发愁。”
    炼铁并不神秘
    在米山乡贺岗铁厂的“八女炼铁炉”旁，宋丑儿和李春花正在挥动两臂摇动木制鼓风机炼铁。一个月以前，她俩就来到这个厂，和另外六个新“巧姑娘”一直坚守在炼铁炉旁日夜炼铁。
    掌握从捏坩锅、配料、装料，到冶炼这一套土法炼铁技术，并不是容易的。最初一个昼夜便建成了一个炼铁土方炉，可是装炉、冶炼等技术却把她们难住了。宋丑儿向一个老技术工人请教。不料对方的回答是：要过四关：捏坩锅、糊风口、铺炉底和看火色，不管你们多巧，最少也要三、四年才能学会。宋丑儿心里不服气，她想：照这样说，我们怎样能在钢铁生产上超英国、赶美国呢？她从这天晚上开始不离炉旁，全神贯注地观察技术工人们的动作。经过两昼夜的认真学习和后来的实际操作、试验，从捏坩锅到炼铁的全套技术初步掌握了，终于炼出了第一炉铁。但是，捏坩锅所消耗的大量劳动，和因为坩锅炼铁需要使用笨重的钢钳、钢夹付出的强度劳动，使她们想到一个新的问题：是不是可以不用坩锅炼铁？并且把这个意见向厂领导上作了汇报。她们在厂党支部书记秦海金帮助下，很快摸索出一种不用坩锅的装炉炼铁方法。采用这种新的冶炼方法，已经试验炼铁八次，每炉出铁由原来的二百多斤增至六百斤。
    学开锅驼机的故事
    这个铁厂的党支部书记秦海金告诉我们，宋丑儿和李春花在炼铁百忙中，挤出时间给厂里检修动力机器，还帮助培训了十个开锅驼机、煤汽机的新学徒。
    说起开锅驼机来，王乐平、宋丑儿和李春花有过这样一段故事：那是去年的秋天，米山乡刚刚安装了锅驼机，就让她们先到机器房去学习。从来没有见过机器的这些农村姑娘，心里又喜欢又害怕。一到机器房，听到隆隆的机器响心里就发慌，可是当她们知道了机器抽水浇地的好处，就爱上了机器。
    她们来到机器房不久，凑巧，机器的水泵坏了，锅驼机手很着急，她们心里也就更害怕。但是她们互相鼓励：“沉住气，学不会我们绝不退出机器房。”她们想：必须先熟悉锅驼机，才能掌握它。于是她们从小事作起，帮助锅驼机手添煤生火，在机器旁看来看去，不懂就问，不会就学，休息的时候，就请教技术员给她们讲锅驼机的构造原理。当别人回家吃饭和休息的时候，她们就学习操作，连饭也顾不上吃。就这样不到半月的时间，她们学会了操作。不久又学会了修理机器。从此，社里就让她们担任了锅驼机手。
    荒沟变菜园
    我们来到米山北门外的梯形菜园地里，看到刚刚浇过水的一畦畦白菜、萝卜和青菜，呈现一片碧绿。这里有两眼水井，距菜园地不远的山岗上有水源充足的水库，新栽种的葡萄、苹果、桃、杏、梨等各种果树，还有几百窝新繁殖的蜜蜂，目睹这种美丽的景色，使人很难相信就在一年多以前，这块菜园地上还是杂草丛生的荒沟。
    向导王乐平说，在开辟这块菜园地的时候，她和宋丑儿、李春花积极参加了社里的农田基本建设队伍，一块参加劳动。她们日夜苦战七十天，削平二百多公尺长、十公尺高的荒山坡，又把荒沟上部的洪水道垒石填土堵住，让洪水改道，然后在河滩上挖石填土，才修成这块十五亩大、可以水浇的梯形菜园。恰巧，竣工不久落了一场滂沱大雨，正在菜园整地的乐平、丑儿和春花看到许多人避雨回家了。她们心里却十分不安，唯恐新修的菜园地被洪水冲垮，踏着泥泞难行的道路，手拉着手直向山坡奔去。她们和赶到山上的“万宝全”（什么事都能干的社员）在一起，冒着大雨坚持了五个小时，衣服湿透了，挖通了一条四丈长的排水渠，使泛滥的洪水纳入排水渠，维护了全乡第一次诞生的这块水地菜园。第一年共收获的各种菜蔬十万斤。
    “巧姑娘”水井
    在菜园地附近的一所机器房里，煤汽机带动着水车，使一股湍急的流水，从五丈多深的井下提升到地面流向菜园地里。
    这眼水井，是三个“巧姑娘”苦干、苦学，并且向保守思想作斗争打成的。当社长发动打这眼水井的时候，有些人反对说：“米山从来没有打过井种过菜，这是出力大、技术强、拖泥带水的苦活计。”这时，宋丑儿、王乐平、李春花三人商量说：“都说米山祖祖辈辈没有打井、种菜的，咱们是党团员，要干前人没有干过的新事，给大家摆出个样子看看！”她们一齐带头报名参加打井。这时，有的男人们讥笑说：男人们还不敢下井，女人们怎能行？有些老人认为：女人打井不出水，女孩搞这个真不像话。她们在这个乡的党支部支持下，不怕天寒地冻，不怕人们笑话，脱了鞋袜，挽起裤腿，不分昼夜地干，手磨破了也不叫苦。在打到三尺多深时，社干部发现她们的井筒打的不直，便告诉她们：建设社会主义不能只靠热情，更重要的是提高技术水平。她们懂得了学习技术的重要以后，就苦心钻研技术，终于在“万宝全”帮助下，掌握了绑架、砌砖、打井等一套复杂的技术，打成了这眼水井。
