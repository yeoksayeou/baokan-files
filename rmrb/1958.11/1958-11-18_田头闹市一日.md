A Day at the Fieldside Market
By our reporter Zhou Zhesheng

Since the "Big Water Ladle" field army regiment, formed by the Huangquan People's Commune, set up camp in "Big Water Ladle," and began reclaiming wasteland and autumn planting a month ago, factories, shops, and hospitals serving the regiment's more than 1,000 people have been established one after another. This has quickly transformed the once desolate and uninhabited "Big Water Ladle" into a new type of market—a fieldside market.

At one o'clock in the morning on October 12, while people were still sound asleep, Shi Denghe, the director of the agricultural implement repair factory of the Huangquan People's Commune's Big Water Ladle field army regiment, woke up and couldn't fall back asleep. "Old Shi! Now is the golden time for autumn planting, and whether the soldiers can complete the sowing of these 10,000 mu of land by the 20th as planned depends mainly on whether you can quickly modify the seeders." Thinking of what regiment political commissar Kou Congnian had said during the day, Shi Denghe threw off the warm quilt and jumped up, lighting the gasoline lamp. Chen Boheng, a carpenter who shared the room, and others also put on their clothes and went to the field to start working with their tools. By the time the east turned white, the twenty or so iron and wood workers in the agricultural implement repair factory had modified more than sixty seeders. Together with the work of the previous two days, they completed the task assigned by the regiment to modify two hundred and eighty seeders.

At five o'clock that morning, Lu Mingqi, a clerk at the general store, swept the entrance clean to welcome customers. The general store had a wide variety of goods. Daily necessities included towels, socks, and cotton cloth; stationery included fountain pens, pencils, and notebooks; food included oil, salt, wine, pickles, sweets, and tea snacks... Soldiers who came to the store to buy things could generally find satisfactory goods. The soldiers thanked the clerk for opening the store at the fieldside, otherwise they would have to travel to the market town ten miles away to buy things.

Next to the general store, a long sign with the words "Huangquan People's Commune Big Water Ladle Field Army Regiment Clothing Sewing Factory" attracted attention. During breaks, people carrying cloth and clothes came in and out. That noon, a young woman named Wang Xiangcai hurried to the sewing factory with seven feet of flowered cloth to have a jacket made. She repeatedly asked the sewing workers to finish it by the 18th or 19th at the latest, because the regiment would be holding a cultural evening to celebrate the harvest and the end of autumn planting on those two days, and she planned to wear her new clothes on stage to sing. The sewing factory received a dozen or twenty sets of clothing materials every day, and the workers couldn't finish them even working from six o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock at night. Regiment Political Commissar Kou Congnian promised to transfer a few sewing workers from elsewhere.

Soldier Wu Xingrui limped into the regiment hospital, and Doctor Sun Xianlin helped him sit down and gave him acupuncture. The hospital's medical records showed that Wu Xingrui had sprained his right foot on the 7th while plowing the land, and it was swollen an inch thick. After five days of acupuncture, the swelling and pain had completely disappeared. The doctor said that he would be completely healed after two more days of treatment. While treating patients, the doctor also conducted safety production education and introduced hygiene knowledge to them. A total of twenty people were treated that day. Anyone who sought treatment at the regiment hospital did not have to pay a penny, because the commune had implemented free medical care.

The barbershop and cobbler's stand in the open space opposite the hospital were also busy, as people were contributing to this virgin land, striving to produce 1,000 catties of wheat per mu on the 10,000 mu of land in "Big Water Ladle" next year.

What is described here is just one day at the fieldside market of "Big Water Ladle" in Donghai County, northern Jiangsu's Xuhuai Plain. The fieldside market reflects the question of how all sectors of society should serve agricultural production after the people's communes were formed and the regiments were stationed in the fields.

    田头闹市一日
    本报记者  周哲生
    自从黄圈人民公社组成的大水瓢野战兵团，在“大水瓢”安营扎寨，开垦荒地、秋播秋种一个月来，为兵团一千多人服务的工厂、商店、医院先后建立，使这个曾经是冷冷清清、没有人烟的“大水瓢”，很快形成一个新型市场——田头闹市。
    10月12日清晨一时，当人们还在熟睡的时候，黄圈人民公社大水瓢野战兵团农具修配厂厂长时登和，一觉醒来，翻来复去睡不着。“老时！现在是一刻值千金的秋播大好时光，战士们要能按计划在20日前播种完这万亩土地，主要看你们能不能突击把耩子改装好。”想到白天兵团政治委员寇从年的话，时登和掀开了暖和和的被子，霍地一声爬了起来，燃点汽油灯。同睡在一个屋子的木工陈伯恒等人，一个个也跟着穿好衣服，走到田头场地拿起工具干起活来。东方发白了，农具修配厂的二十多个铁木工人，已经改装了六十多部耩子。加上前两天的劳动，完成了兵团交给改装两百八十部耩子的任务。
                                                  ＊
    这天早上五点钟，综合商店的营业员路明岐就把门口打扫得干干净净，迎接顾客。综合商店商品花样繁多。日用百货有毛巾、袜子、棉布，文具用品有自来水笔、铅笔、笔记簿，食品有油、盐、酒、酱菜、糖果和茶食，……。到商店买东西的战士一般都能挑选到称心满意的商品。战士们感谢营业员把商店开设在田头，不然要跑到十里路的集镇才能买到。
            ＊
    综合商店隔壁，写着“黄圈人民公社大水瓢野战兵团服装缝纫厂”字样的一块长牌子惹人注目。每到休息时间，挟着布料和衣服的人从这里进进出出。这天中午，青年姑娘王香彩夹着七尺花布匆匆地走到缝纫厂，加工褂子，她一再要求缝纫工人最好在18或19日缝制成功，因为那两天兵团要举行庆丰收庆秋播结束的文娱晚会，她打算穿上新衣登台演唱。缝纫厂每天要收到一二十套衣服料子，工人早上六点钟上工，晚上十点钟下工都做不完。兵团政委寇从年答应从别处调来几个缝纫工人。
            ＊
    战士吴行瑞一拐一拐地走进兵团医院，医生孙咸磷扶他坐下，代他针灸。医院的病历表上记载着，吴行瑞在7日因翻地不慎，蹩住右脚，肿有寸把厚，经过五天针灸，肿痛全部消除。医生说，只要再医治两天，就可痊愈。医生一面替病人治病，一面向他们进行安全生产教育和介绍卫生常识。这天一共医治了二十人。凡是在兵团医院就诊的人，不需付分文，因为公社实行了免费医疗。
            ＊
    医院对面空地上的理发处和皮匠担等服务行业也很忙碌，人们都在为这块处女地出力，争取“大水瓢”万亩土地明年亩产小麦千斤。
    这里记述的只是江苏北部徐淮平原东海县境“大水瓢”田头闹市的一日。田头闹市，反映了人民公社化以后，兵团田头扎营，各行各业该如何为农业生产服务的问题。
