Strive to Explore the Great Treasury of Chinese Medicine
Report to Chairman and the Central Committee by the Party Group of the Ministry of Health on the Situation, Achievements, and Experience of the Western Medicine Practitioners Leaving Their Posts to Study Traditional Chinese Medicine Classes:
We began organizing Western medicine practitioners to study traditional Chinese medicine in December 1955. In addition to general on-the-job training, we also organized six classes (303 people) of full-time study to cultivate the backbone of medical treatment, teaching, and research of traditional Chinese medicine, in order to further promote the widespread study of traditional Chinese medicine by Western medicine practitioners. The first class, established by the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, graduated in June of this year, and the summary of results is in line with the predetermined goals. The teaching process and work experience of this class are reported as follows:
This class was established in December 1955, with a total of 76 students, all young and middle-aged Western medicine practitioners under the age of 40, including 29 Party members and 23 League members. Their academic performance was good. We have assigned more than half of the students to work at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the rest have been assigned to the Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine and other medical colleges, but they are currently concentrated at the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, learning teaching and clinical research with experienced Chinese medicine practitioners.
The learning process of this class is as follows: First, they studied the policies of traditional Chinese medicine and dialectical materialism, and then studied the basic theories of traditional Chinese medicine (i.e., lectures on excerpts from the *Inner Canon*, *Treatise on Febrile Diseases*, *Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber*, and *Materia Medica*, written in modern language, explaining the treatment rules and theoretical principles of traditional Chinese medicine). The main method was listening to lectures by traditional Chinese medicine teachers and self-study by students. This lasted for a total of six months, enabling all students to have the ability to read any traditional Chinese medicine books; then they studied various clinical departments of traditional Chinese medicine, mainly through self-study, combined with classroom tutoring and clinical practice for a total of seven months; finally, clinical practice for one year and three months, scattered in Beijing, Nanjing, Suzhou, etc., practicing with experienced traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. Some students went to the countryside to treat the masses during their practice, and the effect and impact were very good. At the end of the study of basic theories, each person wrote a paper. At the end of the classroom study, an award was given, and at the end of the clinical practice, each person wrote another paper, and another award was given at the graduation ceremony. This award was jointly evaluated by students and teachers for academic performance and clinical effect, with three first prizes, seven second prizes, and fifteen third prizes.
From the perspective of gains, out of 76 people, except for a few who were relatively poor, most of them were able to master a set of treatment rules of traditional Chinese medicine, including theory, methods, prescriptions, and medicines. They are already different from ordinary Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and can basically use both Chinese and Western medicine techniques for clinical, teaching, and research work. This will play a significant role in creating a new socialist national medicine in our country, proving that the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine and the call for Western medicine practitioners to study traditional Chinese medicine are completely correct.
Many of them had prejudices against traditional Chinese medicine due to the long-term influence of enslaved thought and bourgeois academic thought in the past. Therefore, at the beginning of their study, there was serious resistance and skepticism towards traditional Chinese medicine. Most people had the wrong ideas such as "traditional Chinese medicine is not scientific," "there is nothing to learn from traditional Chinese medicine," "learning something from two thousand years ago in the atomic age" is "driving backwards," and Western medicine practitioners studying traditional Chinese medicine is a "waste of talent and waste of national manpower and resources." In addition, some unit leaders were hasty and simple in mobilizing them to come to study. At the same time, under the pressure of bourgeois scholars and experts who valued foreign things and despised Chinese things, some sympathetic arguments also believed that "it is such a pity to go and study traditional Chinese medicine," which further increased the ideological burden of some students.
In response to this ideological situation, from within the Party to the masses, we repeatedly presented the facts and explained the reasons, explaining the correctness of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, explaining that traditional Chinese medicine has not only fought against diseases in history and made great contributions to the reproduction of our nation, but also will play its great role for the people's health and for the development of world medicine now and in the future. Especially after the Party's rectification movement and the criticism of bourgeois ideas on traditional Chinese medicine, their understanding was improved and their learning attitude was corrected. Moreover, through the continuous efforts of teachers in teaching, improving teaching methods and conducting after-school tutoring, the teaching effect was improved, and the students gradually became interested in traditional Chinese medicine and felt that the more they learned, the more content there was. In particular, after they personally used traditional Chinese medicine to cure many patients, they personally experienced that using traditional Chinese medicine to treat diseases does have a higher effect. For example, a patient with jaundice was critically ill and Western medicine was ineffective. Later, student Li Jingwei cured him using traditional Chinese medicine methods. In orthopedics, traditional Chinese medicine advocates that there should be a certain amount of activity to keep the blood flowing and facilitate recovery. For old dislocations, only traditional Chinese medicine techniques can be used to reset them. Many vivid examples have made them unanimously recognize that the motherland's medicine is rich and colorful, and there are many things that modern science cannot explain. After the anti-Rightist struggle, the "two antis," seeking truth, and Party education, they were encouraged to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, break superstitions, and liberate their minds, which made them express their love for the motherland's medicine even more. They all expressed their willingness to dedicate their lives to the arduous task of inheriting and carrying forward the legacy of the motherland's medicine and creating new medicine.
However, there are many shortcomings in running this class: First of all, there was insufficient understanding of the arduousness of this new work, and there was a lack of thorough preparation before the class started. For example, it was not made clear which department of Western medicine should be transferred to study, and the ideological work of cadres at all levels of health departments was neglected. Some areas were simple and crude when selecting students, did not explain the policies, explain the reasons, emphasized organizational allocation, and ignored the principle of voluntariness. Some even deliberately pushed out people who were ideologically backward, had low levels, and could not be doctors. The ideological work during the learning process was also insufficient.
In particular, the leadership was not responsible enough. For example, not enough teachers were allocated in teaching, and there were only one or two full-time teachers at all times, and the rest were part-time. Because the teachers were not fixed, there were as many as ten or twenty teachers for one course, and it was not possible to conduct collective discussions before class to reach a roughly consistent opinion. As a result, the content of the lectures was contradictory, unconnected, and even some teachers were self-righteous and criticized each other, leaving the students at a loss. This situation greatly affected the teaching quality and learning mood, and even some important courses were not well learned, and they had to work overtime to make up lessons at the internship site.
Several experiences:
1.  Western medicine practitioners studying traditional Chinese medicine must rely on the leadership of the Party, put politics in command, and strengthen ideological education. This is the fundamental reason why this class has achieved some success. It is necessary to continuously conduct socialist and communist education for cadres, teachers, and students, improve class consciousness, and improve ideological level, so that everyone clearly recognizes that Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine is to better serve socialism and communism; to create happiness for mankind, and to combine Chinese and Western medicine to create a new socialist national medicine in our country, so that they clearly understand their learning responsibilities and the goals of their struggle.
Before learning the basic theories of traditional Chinese medicine, we should first study Chairman Mao's *On Contradiction*, *On Practice*, and other Marxist philosophical theories. Experience has proved that those who have initially established a dialectical materialist viewpoint are more likely to accept traditional Chinese medicine.
2.  When learning the basic theories and treatment rules of traditional Chinese medicine, we must closely combine with clinical practice, so that theory is combined with practice, so that experience verifies the role of theory and theory guides practice. For the study of clinical departments, we should generally read famous works of past dynasties and learn from the experience of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. This will better experience the principle of "systematic learning, comprehensive mastery, and consolidation and improvement," and effectively achieve the learning requirements of applying what you have learned.
3.  The duration of full-time study can be roughly set at about two years to master it if the teaching is further improved and the teaching effect is improved.
4.  The object of the students should be young Western medicine practitioners who have graduated from university or equivalent level, have two or three years of clinical experience, are around 30 years old, are politically left-leaning, support the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, and are willing to dedicate themselves to inheriting and carrying forward the cause of the motherland's medicine. Party members and League members are most suitable.
5.  To solve the problem of traditional Chinese medicine teachers and teaching materials, we must select traditional Chinese medicine practitioners with rich academic knowledge and experience in the local area as teachers, organize them, conduct joint research, conduct collective lesson preparation, trial lectures before class, after-class tutoring, and mobilize teachers and students to discuss together to improve teaching methods at any time.
Teachers should explain and explain in a realistic manner using the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, and should clearly know how much to know and how much to speak, and oppose hypocrisy and exaggeration, pretending to understand what they do not understand, or being complacent, and oppose reluctantly explaining in modern language that does not conform to the original meaning or rigidly applying Western medicine terms, which hinders the teaching effect.
Regarding the issue of teaching materials, many lectures have been compiled in various places, although they are not yet complete or have shortcomings and errors, they have initially achieved a more organized and systematic approach, which is fundamentally different from two years ago when there were no teaching materials at all. As long as we organize forces to gradually supplement and revise them in teaching, we will soon be able to compile more complete teaching materials.
In order to further run full-time study classes well, so that more Western medicine practitioners can receive this kind of learning, we suggest that in the future, each province, city, and autonomous region should plan and hold them independently. In order to cultivate more, faster, better, and more economically a new type of doctor who understands both Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, masters both sets of academic knowledge, and has communist consciousness, under the direct leadership of the Party committees of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, so as to create conditions for the early realization of the new socialist national medicine in our country. Whether the above report is appropriate, please instruct.

    努力发掘中国医药学伟大宝库
    中央卫生部党组关于西医学中医离职班情况、成绩和经验给中央的报告主席并中央：
    我们于1955年12月开始组织西医学习中医，除了一般在职学习外，并为培植医疗、教学和整理研究中医学的骨干，以便进一步广泛推动西医学习中医，重点地组织了离职学习六个班（三百零三人）。首由中医研究院创办的一个班，已于本年6月毕业，总结成果，尚符合预定目标。现将这个班的教学过程和工作经验报告如下：
    这个班于1955年12月开办，共有学员七十六人，年龄都在四十岁以下的青壮年西医，中有党员二十九人，团员二十三人。他们的学习成绩良好。我们已将半数以上的学员分配在中医研究院工作，其余部分，分配在北京中医学院和其他医学院校，但他们目前尚集中在中医学院跟有经验的中医在一起练习教学和临症研究等工作。
    这班的学习进程是：开始学习中医政策和辩证唯物主义，接着即学习中医学的基本理论（即用现代语言编写的内经节要、伤寒论、金匮要略、本草经等讲义，说明中医的治疗规律和理论原则），主要方式是听取中医老师讲课和学员自己复习。计共六个月，使全部学员都具有读中医任何医籍的能力；嗣即学习中医临症各科，此时以自学为主，结合课堂辅导和临症见习计共七个月；最后临症实习一年零三个月，分散在北京、南京、苏州等，跟有经验的中医实习，部分学员在实习时曾到农村为群众治病，效果和影响都很好。在学习基本理论结束时，每人写过一篇论文。在结束课堂学习时发过一次奖，临症实习结束时每人又写一篇论文，毕业典礼会上又发了一次奖。这次奖是由学员和老师们共同评定学习成绩和临症效果，计获一等奖三人，二等奖七人，三等奖十五人。
    从收获来看，七十六人中除有个别人较差外，一般都能掌握中医的理、法、方、药一套治病规律。他们已经不同于一般西医和中医，基本上能运用中、西医两套技术进行临症、教学和研究工作。这对创造我国社会主义的民族的新医学，将起重大的作用。证明党的中医政策和号召西医学习中医是完全正确的。
    他们中许多人由于过去长期受到奴化思想与资产阶级学术思想的影响，对中医有偏见，因此，在开始学习时，对中医存在着严重的抵触情绪和怀疑态度。多数人存在“中医不科学”，“中医无可学之处”；“原子时代还来学二千年前的东西”，这是“开倒车”，西医学习中医是“浪费人才，浪费国家人力物力”等等的错误思想。加上有些单位领导在动员他们前来学习时，工作做得草率简单，同时受到资产阶级学者专家重外轻中的舆论压力，有些同情这种错误思想的论调，也认为“去学中医多么可惜”，这样更增加了一些学员的思想负担。
    针对这种思想情况，我们从党内到群众，反复地摆事实讲道理，说明党对中医政策的正确性，说明中医不仅在历史上和疾病作斗争，对我国民族的繁衍作出很大的贡献，而且现在和将来为人民的健康事业，为世界医学的发展将更要发挥它的伟大作用。尤其是经过党的整风运动，经过批判资产阶级思想对中医的错误看法，从而提高了认识，端正了学习态度。并在教学上经过老师不断的努力，改进教学方法和进行课余辅导，提高了教学效果，学员们逐步对中医发生兴趣，觉得越学越有内容。特别是经过他们亲手以中医的学术治好了不少病人，他们亲身体会到，用中医学术治病，确有较高效果。比如：有一黄疸患者，病势危急，西医医治无效，后由学员李经纬用中医办法治好了；又如骨科方面，中医主张要有一定的活动，使血液畅通，容易痊愈，对陈旧性脱臼，只使用中医手法就可以复位等很多生动事例，使他们一致认识了祖国医学丰富多采，有好些是现代科学上还不能解释的。再经过反右斗争、双反、务虚，党的教育，启发他们敢想、敢说、敢干，破除迷信，解放思想，使他们更表露出热爱祖国医学的心情，都表示终身愿为继承与发扬祖国医学遗产和创造新医学的艰巨事业而奋斗。
    但是，我们办这个班是有很多缺点的：首先对这一新工作艰巨性认识不足，开班前缺乏周密的准备，如没有说清调那一科的西医来学，并忽视对各级卫生部门做好调干的思想工作，有些地区选送学员时简单粗糙，没有讲清政策，说明道理，强调组织分配，忽视自愿原则，有的甚至将思想落后、水平很低不能作医生的人故意推出来的现象。在学习过程中思想工作做的也不够。
    特别是领导负责不够，如在教学上没有调配足够的教师，始终只有一两个专职教师，其余都是兼职。由于教师不固定，使一门课程的教师竟达一、二十人之多，不能做到课前集体讨论，取得大体一致的意见，以致讲的内容前后矛盾，互不联系，甚至有的教师自以为是互相非难，使学员无所适从。这种情况，大大影响了教学质量和学习情绪，甚至有些重要课程没有学好，到实习场所又不得不加班补课。
    几点经验：
    一、西医学习中医必须依靠党的领导，政治挂帅，加强思想教育，这是本班能取得一些成绩的根本原因。要对干部、教师、学员不断的进行社会主义和共产主义教育，提高阶级觉悟，提高思想水平，使大家明确认识西医学好中医是为了更好的为社会主义和共产主义服务；为人类创造幸福，为中西医学结合创造出我国社会主义的民族的新医学的重大意义，使他们清楚地了解自己学习的责任和奋斗的目标。
    在学习中医基本理论之前，应首先学习毛主席的矛盾论、实践论等马克思主义哲学理论。经验证明：凡是初步树立起辩证唯物主义观点的人，比较易于接受中医学术。
    二、学习中医基本理论和治疗规律时，必须紧紧结合临症见习，做到理论结合实际，使体会实践证实理论和理论指导实践的作用。对临症各科的学习，一般应多看历代名著，和跟中医师学习经验。这样更能体验“系统学习，全面掌握，整理提高”的方针，有效地达到学以致用的学习要求。
    三、离职学习的时间，如果在教学上进一步加以改进，提高教学效果，大体上定为二年左右可以学通。
    四、学员对象，以大学毕业或相当的水平，具有二、三年临床经验，年龄在三十岁左右，政治上左派，拥护党的中医政策，并愿献身于继承发扬祖国医学事业的党团员青年西医最为相宜。
    五、要解决中医师资和教材问题，要选择当地学术和经验丰富的中医当教师，把他们组织起来，共同研究，进行集体备课，课前试讲，课后辅导和发动师生一起讨论，随时改进教学方法。
    教师要实事求是的用中医道理阐释讲解，并要明确知多少，讲多少的老实态度，反对虚伪夸大，不懂装懂或故步自封，反对勉强以不合原意的现代语言讲解或硬套西医名词，这些都妨碍教学效果。
    教材问题，目前各地已编出不少讲义，虽尚不完备或有缺点错误，但已初步做到较有条理较有系统，和二年前全无教材时，根本不同，只要组织力量在教学中逐步加以补充修正，将很快可以编出较完备的教材。
    为了进一步办好离职学习班，使更多的西医得到这种学习，我们建议今后由各省、市、自治区自行规划举办。以便在省、市、自治区党委直接领导下更多、更快、更好、更省地培养出既懂西医又懂中医，掌握两套学术，具有共产主义觉悟的新型医生，为促使早日实现我国社会主义的民族的新医学创造条件。以上报告，是否有当，请指示。
