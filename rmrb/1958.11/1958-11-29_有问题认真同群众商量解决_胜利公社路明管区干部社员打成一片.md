Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 28th—In the Luming Management District of the Shengli People's Commune in Lishu County, Jilin Province, many tasks have been completed well and quickly because they always adhere to the mass line and implement democratic management.

The cadres of this management district, from the Party General Branch Secretary and Director to the production team leaders, take the lead in participating in production, leading production in the course of production. Because the cadres can integrate with the commune members in production labor, understand the opinions of the commune members at any time and any place, the commune members also help the leaders to improve their work in a timely manner. For example, one evening in late October, the old commune member Li Baiquan, based on his years of experience, saw that the weather was about to change, so he wrote a big-character poster suggesting that the leaders quickly organize the commune members to pull up the cabbage in the cooperative, cover it well, and prevent it from freezing. At that time, the leading cadres, who were busy with deep plowing and autumn harvesting, saw his suggestion and mobilized the commune members overnight to pull up more than 700,000 catties of cabbage and cover it well. The next day, the weather did change, but the cabbage did not suffer any loss. The potatoes dug up by the Third Production Team were placed outside without being stored in the cellar in time because of the rush to harvest and deep plowing. Commune member Liu Junfeng approached the cadres and made a suggestion. He said: "Our management district will plant more than 100 hectares of potatoes next year. If we don't take good care of the seed potatoes, we won't have any seed potatoes next year." The leaders accepted his suggestion and stored the potatoes in the cellar in time.

When encountering some major tasks or difficulties, this management district can promptly mobilize the masses to discuss, give play to the wisdom of the masses, and study solutions. In early November, the higher authorities instructed them to complete the task of grain purchase and storage within three days. At that time, freezing had already begun, deep plowing could not be relaxed; the grain had not been threshed, and it was indeed very difficult to complete the task within three days. However, the leaders trusted the masses and mobilized all the commune members to conduct a full discussion. The commune members put forward many rationalized suggestions for solving problems, such as "chopping off the heads of sorghum and wiping the necks of millet."

As a result of implementing these suggestions, the entire task of grain purchase and storage was completed in two and a half days. When digging potato cellars, it was found that there was no wood to build the cellars, so the leaders called on everyone to offer suggestions. After discussion by the commune members, it was also resolved.

    有问题认真同群众商量解决
    胜利公社路明管区干部社员打成一片
    新华社长春28日电　吉林省梨树县胜利人民公社路明管理区，由于事事坚持走群众路线，实行民主管理，很多工作都完成得又好又快。
    这个管理区的干部，从党总支书记、主任到生产队长，都带头参加生产，在生产中领导生产。由于干部能和社员在生产劳动中打成一片，随时随地了解社员的意见，社员也及时帮助领导改进工作。如10月下旬的一天傍晚，老社员李白权凭他多年的经验看出天气要变，就写了一张大字报，建议领导上赶快组织社员把社里的白菜拔起来，盖好，防止冻坏。当时，正忙于深翻地和秋收工作的领导干部，看到他的建议后，连夜发动社员把七十多万斤白菜拔起来并盖好。第二天，果然天气变了，但白菜一点也没有受损失。第三生产队起出的土豆（即马铃薯），因为突击秋收和深翻地，就放在外面，没有及时下窖。社员刘俊峰就找干部提出建议。他说：“咱们管理区明年要种一百多公顷土豆，如果不赶快把土豆种保管好，明年可就没有土豆种了。”领导上接受他的建议，及时地把土豆窖了起来。
    这个管理区在遇到一些重大任务或困难时，都能及时地发动群众讨论，发挥群众的智慧，研究解决办法。11月上旬，上级指示他们在三天内完成全区征购粮入库任务。当时已经开始上冻，深翻地不能放松；粮食也没有打下来，要在三天内完成任务，困难确实很多。但领导上相信群众，发动全体社员进行充分讨论，社员们提出了“高粱铡头，谷子抹脖”等许多解决问题的合理化建议。
    按这些建议实行的结果，两天半就完成了全部征购粮入库任务。在挖土豆窖时，发现没有木头搭窖，领导上就号召大家出谋献策。经过社员们讨论，也解决了。
