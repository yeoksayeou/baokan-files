    A Factory with a Lofty Style
    —On the Harbin Military Dependents Sundries Factory
    By our reporter

    On a quiet small street in Harbin, there is a military dependents sundries factory. More than half of the factory's sixty-odd workers are elderly relatives of martyrs and military personnel. Using only a few pairs of scissors, several basins, and a few simple tools for handicraft production, they turn useless waste products from society into products of various properties and uses. This factory has received praise and acclaim from all quarters. There are many vivid stories about how the relatives of martyrs and military personnel started this factory from scratch, and how they carried out distribution and helped others with a communist spirit.

    Three Old Men Running Around for Whom?

    This happened in early 1955.

    In Taigu Street, Daowai District, Harbin, there was a 61-year-old military dependent representative named Zhu Hengchang. He always satisfied everyone when handling matters for the relatives of martyrs and military personnel. Therefore, the relatives of martyrs and military personnel all liked to confide in him.

    One evening, an old military dependent woman surnamed Ding suddenly asked him if it was possible to organize everyone to engage in some production. He thought that this military dependent was having some financial difficulties, but Aunt Ding said, "We rely on the government for everything we eat and wear all year round. How could we have any difficulties? But seeing young people all have work to do, and we, who are getting old, are just being supported by everyone, it's as if we've become old waste! Tell me, do we not even have any use?"

    Afterwards, Zhu Hengchang discussed it with other elderly relatives of martyrs and military personnel, and decided to start a military dependents production group. He found two helpers: Chen Fushun, the deputy director of the residents' committee who could read and write, and Wei Jinchen, the leader of the residents' group who made cloth shells for shoe soles. These two people were also getting on in years, although they were not relatives of martyrs and military personnel, but as soon as they heard that they were going to do something for the relatives of martyrs and military personnel, they were very willing to do their part.

    They were truly "poor and blank." They had nothing. How could they start a factory? They had no building. Zhu Hengchang rented a room from the private dye shop where he used to work, using the wages the dye shop owed him before the public-private partnership as rent. They had no funds. They found the district government and obtained a letter of introduction to purchase raw materials on credit. They had no technology. They set their sights on the "garbage dump," looking for waste products as raw materials. They thought that even if production was not good, it would not cause much loss. Finally, the three old men discussed that they would work for free for the first three months without pay.

    In this way, the three old men started the military dependents production group. They searched everywhere for waste materials, running twenty or thirty miles every day, all over the streets and alleys and the suburbs, for ten days in a row. They went out to find raw materials during the day and went home to eat at night, but there were no results. Later, they went to large factories to find a way.

    The first factory they found was the locomotive and rolling stock repair factory. When the section chief Ji, who was in charge of managing waste materials at this factory, heard that they wanted to buy waste materials, he led them to the backyard of the factory to see a pile of used rags for wiping machines. The railway factory kept these things to mix with broken coal for burning. Zhu Hengchang looked at it and said that it could be boiled in a pot to extract the oil and then disassemble the threads. Section Chief Ji was very happy that these waste materials could be used in this way, and said, "The price is easy to negotiate. Just give us the cost of the coal, fifty yuan per ton."

    So, the three old men brought frozen dry rations every day to this factory to bundle this large pile of rags. Section Chief Ji taught them how to bundle, and their work went very smoothly. In a few days, they bundled all the large pile of rags, calculating a total of five tons.

    Let's settle the accounts. Five fives are two hundred and fifty yuan. Section Chief Ji wrote a receipt and asked the three old men to pay the money. At this time, Zhu Hengchang took out the letter of introduction from the district government from his pocket and said to Section Chief Ji, "We are relatives of martyrs and military personnel, and we are relief recipients from the government. We want to engage in some production, but we don't even have a penny on hand. You have to give us credit for a few days, and we will dismantle the money, sell it, and then pay you back." When Section Chief Ji heard that it was military dependents engaged in production, he quickly said:

    "Oh, my old men, why didn't you say so earlier! We have provided too little help to you these days. If relatives of martyrs and military personnel want to engage in production, let alone two hundred and fifty yuan on credit, even two thousand five hundred yuan is fine!"

    On March 1st, the Taigu Street Military Dependents Production Group was formally established. On the day of the start of construction, all the twenty-odd elderly relatives of martyrs and military personnel were all talking and laughing. Aunt Ding, who first proposed to engage in production, shouted and shouted while holding a ball of white thread just taken from the broken gloves: "Look! We old wastes have a use!"

    A New Type of Distribution Method

    The relatives of martyrs and military personnel started production and no longer relied on national relief all year round, but directly enjoyed the fruits of their labor. However, how should the fruits of labor be distributed?

    Their first payday was March 16, 1955. The twenty-odd relatives of martyrs and military personnel, some earned seventy cents for a day's work, some earned eighty cents, and the most earned ninety cents. It didn't seem any different from anywhere else. However, some who were stronger in labor ability and did more work, but did not have heavy family burdens, only earned seventy cents a day, earning less money. While some who were weaker in labor ability and had heavy family burdens, earned ninety cents, earning more money instead.

    From the old point of view, it seemed unreasonable. But these relatives of martyrs and military personnel all knew that this was discussed by Zhu Hengchang, Chen Fushun and Wei Jinchen, and most people thought that this must be reasonable. However, after all, some people did not understand it all at once. At the life review meeting after the first distribution of wages, Zhang Zhaoqing, a military dependent in his fifties who was slightly stronger in labor ability and did not have heavy family burdens, asked: "Can this distribution of wages be considered fair? Why do those who do less work get more money?"

    Zhu Hengchang looked at everyone and asked Zhang Zhaoqing, "How many people are in your family?"

    "Three," Zhang Zhaoqing replied to the question as if he understood.

    Zhu Hengchang pointed to Song Yuting, who was over seventy years old and sitting next to Zhang Zhaoqing, and asked Zhang Zhaoqing, "Do you know how many people are in his family?"

    Zhang Zhaoqing replied: "Six people."

    At this time, Zhu Hengchang explained, "In the past, we all relied on government relief. Now that we are engaged in production, those with more people will receive two cents more, and those with fewer people will receive two cents less. Is this fair or unfair?"

    Before everyone could speak, Zhang Zhaoqing preemptively said, "You didn't say it earlier. If you had said it earlier, I would have understood it! No need to discuss it."

    Ten Coins and One Coin

    A year and a half later, with the help of many large factories in Harbin and following the development path instructed by the district committee, the military dependents production group developed into a military dependents sundries production cooperative. At this time, there was a small storm of people coming to compete for buying sheep manure.

    The military dependents sundries production cooperative selected wool from "sheep wool manure", leaving a lot of sheep manure. In the spring of 1956, the Jiulian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaozhuang Township, Tianjin suburbs, did not know how they heard that there was a large batch of sheep manure here. They sent people to come by train. The sundries cooperative signed a contract with them, only charging a little manual fee, calculated at two li per catty. The Jiulian cooperative transported back 720,000 catties of sheep manure from them throughout the year. Applying it to the fields could not only increase production but also kill insects. In the fall, the rice harvest was abundant and was rated as a typical rice high-yield cooperative in Tianjin. So they discussed again, and in 1957, they would still order it according to the original contract, as much as they needed. Not long after, a comrade surnamed Xiong from a cooperative in Beijing came. This Comrade Xiong came to the sundries factory and found Zhu Hengchang and said, "I heard that you sold sheep manure to Tianjin last year for two li per catty; this year, is it okay to sign another contract with us? We will add a little price, giving you two cents per catty, what do you think?"

    Before Comrade Xiong finished speaking, Zhu Hengchang replied decisively, "No, if you say that, I won't sell you even one catty! We don't love you for having ten coins more, and we don't dislike him for having one coin less!"

    Comrade Xiong looked a little embarrassed when he heard this. Zhu Hengchang realized that treating a guest from afar in this way was a bit too simple and blunt, so he made some explanations. He said: "We relatives of martyrs and military personnel never just focus on money. If we get a little sheep manure, we will supply it to whoever needs it, so that it can play a greater role!"

    Comrade Xiong explained again and again, saying that he should not have raised the question like that in the first place. At that time, Zhu Hengchang considered that they were from the capital and should be supported even more, so he agreed to discuss it with the Jiulian cooperative in Tianjin and have some transported to Beijing for Comrade Xiong. Before Zhu Hengchang wrote a letter to Tianjin, the Jiulian cooperative happened to send someone to transport manure, and the three parties met together. It was decided that 25% would be given to Beijing, transported through Tianjin. As for the price, it was still two li per catty.

    "No Raw Materials" Find the Sundries Factory

    That quiet street where the sundries factory is located rarely had outsiders coming here in the past, but in the past six months, people from far and near have been attracted to the sundries factory. From Harbin city and its suburbs, there are many workers, farmers, and students, as well as troops stationed. Those from afar not only include people from dozens of counties in Heilongjiang Province, but also large cities and large factories and mines thousands of miles away, the capital Beijing, Baotou Iron and Steel Company, have also had people come. A few days ago, because there were too many guests and the sundries factory was too small, they had to make appointments with nearby guests and arrange the order for visits.

    Why are people so interested in the sundries factory? The Longjiang Electric Factory was one of the many large factories that supported the sundries factory, and they had established a very good friendship with each other long ago. Last year, there was a period when the Longjiang Electric Factory lacked cotton yarn for wiping machines and could not buy it for a while. When the sundries factory learned about it, they immediately told the Longjiang Electric Factory a way - boiling and washing the old cotton yarn used for wiping machines can completely replace the new one. So, the comrades of the materials supply section of the Longjiang Electric Factory collected tons of old cotton yarn and handed it over to the sundries factory for processing and utilization. The sundries factory boiled down the oil for their own use, and washed the cotton yarn to hand over to the Longjiang Electric Factory. In this way, the things that were originally thrown away after being used for wiping machines once were processed again and again, and used for the third and fourth time... until they could no longer be used. The comrades of the materials supply section of the Longjiang Electric Factory deeply received a vivid lesson in diligence and frugality in running enterprises, and since then they have successively utilized six or seven kinds of waste materials.

    Many factories, large and small, have received education in diligence and frugality in running enterprises here, and have solved very big problems. In the past, the Fujin County White Iron Production Cooperative was always idle for half a year because of insufficient raw materials. The director of the cooperative led people to the sundries factory and saw that they used iron sheets and iron corners as raw materials to make very good mirror corners and buttons, and slapped his head and said: "Oh! We don't even have a place to throw these raw materials, we bury them all in the ground!" After seeing it, the Fujin County White Iron Production Cooperative left people to study in the sundries factory for two weeks, learned how to manufacture steel molds for making buttons using waste materials, and after returning, they dug up all the waste materials buried in the ground and never stopped working due to lack of raw materials again. Since then, more and more people from various counties in Heilongjiang Province have come to visit and study every day, to learn how to manufacture small metal products, to learn how to manufacture rayon. All the small factories and small cooperatives that have encountered difficulties in production have come. The people who come here tell the sundries factory that the leaders in their county told them: "If you don't have raw materials, find the sundries factory, take a look at the Harbin sundries factory, and you will have everything when you come back!"

    However, what people have learned from the sundries factory is even more valuable than this, that is, the communist style of selflessness.

    The Highest Reward

    On the walls of the sundries factory office, there are dozens of brocade banners and color mirrors hanging tightly. Some are awarded by the leading organs, and more are presented by some small factories and agricultural production cooperatives. Most people send these brocade banners and color mirrors to thank them for their strong support in terms of materials and technology.

    How can such a small sundries factory, which specializes in dealing with "garbage dumps", with only 14,000 yuan of fixed assets and 135,000 yuan of circulating funds, provide "strong support" to so many units?

    Let's see how they are "selfless": In April of this year, Harbin started to run street industries. Several people in Chongjian Street, Daowai District, wanted to start an iron utensil production cooperative with a "capital" of more than two yuan. They found the sundries factory and asked them for help.

    Without saying a word, the sundries factory. The factory council, composed of several elderly military dependents, studied it and took out 1,000 yuan from their own funds, and selected some iron sheets and iron barrels from their own raw material piles, fully loading six large carts, and gave them all to them. Then, the sundries factory sent people to look around and paid in advance to buy them a fully functional hand-operated press that was cheaper than the market price. Zhu Hengchang said to the people who were running the factory in Chongjian Street: "If you have any difficulties, don't look for others, we will take care of it! We know the difficulties of running a factory, we were also helped by others!"

    Soon, the iron utensil production cooperative was established. They did not send any brocade banners or color mirrors to the sundries factory, but they did another thing with a communist style. When they had just accumulated 1,000 yuan of funds, more residents on the street wanted to start a factory from scratch, so they lent this money out. When one factory used it and returned it, they lent it to another factory. If it was not enough to lend it to one factory, they would disperse it and lend it to several factories at the same time. There are now more than eighty street factories in Chongjian Street, more than fifty of which have received financial assistance from this iron utensil production cooperative.

    The person in charge of the iron utensil production cooperative said: "All the comrades in our cooperative have studied it several times, and we have no way to express our gratitude, so we decided to learn from the spirit of selflessness of the military dependents sundries factory!"

    Zhu Hengchang, the old director of the sundries factory, said: "They gave us the highest reward!"

    The military dependents sundries factory has been infinitely loved by the society, and people call it a "communist university." Their communist spirit of selflessness has caused a chain reaction here like an atomic explosion. (Attached picture)

    一个风格高尚的工厂
    ——记哈尔滨军属杂品厂
    本报记者
    在哈尔滨一条僻静的小街上，有个军属杂品厂。厂里六十几个工人，一半以上是老年烈、军属。他们只用几把剪子、几个盆子和几件简单的工具进行手工业生产，把社会上无用的废品，变成各种性能、各种用途的产品。这个工厂得到各方面的赞扬和好评。这里的烈、军属们怎样白手起家创办起这个工厂，又怎样以共产主义精神进行分配和帮助别人。这里有许多生动的故事。
    三位老大爷为谁奔跑
    这是1955年年初发生的事情。
    哈尔滨市道外区太古街有个六十一岁的军属代表，名叫朱恒昌。他给烈、军属们办事情，总让大家满意。所以烈、军属们都爱和他说句知心话儿。
    一天晚上，一个姓丁的军属老大娘，忽然问他能不能把大家组织起来搞点生产。他还以为这家军属在生活上有了什么困难，可是丁大娘说：“我们成年价依靠政府吃现成的，还会有什么困难？可就是眼看着年轻人都有活干，我们上点年纪的人光让大伙养活着，简直成了老废物！你说说，我们就连一点用处也没有？”
    事后，朱恒昌和别的老年烈、军属们商量商量，就确定创办一个军属生产小组。他找了两个帮手，一个是会写会算的居民委员会副主任陈福顺，另一个是做打鞋底的布壳子的居民组长魏晋臣。这两个人也都是有了一把年纪的人，虽然不是烈、军属，但一听说要给烈、军属们办事情，也就很愿意尽点义务。
    他们真正是“一穷二白”，要啥没啥，怎么办厂呢？没房子，朱恒昌到他原来做工的那家私营染房去租了一间，把公私合营前染房欠他的工资作了房租；没资金，他们找到区政府，开了一封介绍信，到外面去赊原料；没技术，他们就往“垃圾堆”上打主意，找废物作原料，他们想，即便生产不好，可也不会造成多大损失。最后，三位老大爷商量，开头先来白干三个月，不要工资。
    就这样，三位老大爷动手创办军属生产小组了。他们到处寻找废物料，每天要跑二、三十里路，跑遍了大街小巷和市郊，一连十几天，白天出外找原料，晚上回到自己家里吃饭，可是没有结果。后来，才跑到大工厂去找门路。
    第一个是找到机车车辆修理工厂。这个厂管理废旧物品的纪股长一听他们要买废物料，就领他们到工厂后院看了一堆擦机器用过的破手套。铁路工厂留着这些东西，是要用它掺合碎煤烧火的。朱恒昌看了看，说是可以用锅煮一煮，煮下油来再拆线。纪股长很高兴这些废物料能有这样的用处，就说：“价钱好办，给个煤钱就行了，五十元一吨。”
    于是，三位老大爷每天带上冻干粮，到这个厂来捆这一大堆破手套。纪股长教他们学会了打捆的办法，他们的工作进行得十分顺利。没有几天时间，就把很大一堆破手套全都捆好了，算了算整整五吨。
    算账吧，五五二百五十元，纪股长写好了一张单据，请三位老大爷交款。当时朱恒昌从怀里摸出区政府的介绍信，向纪股长说：“我们是烈、军属，是政府救济户，想搞点生产，可是手头连一文钱也没有。你得先赊几天，等我们拆出钱来，卖了钱再还你。”纪股长一听是军属搞生产，连忙说：
    “嗳呀我的老大爷，你们怎不早说呢！这些天，我们对你们的帮助太少了，烈、军属要搞生产，别说是赊二百五十元，就是要赊二千五百元也行！”
    3月1日，太古街军属生产小组正式成立。开工这天，全组二十几个烈、军属老大爷、老大娘，全都有说有笑。第一个倡议搞生产的丁老大娘，拿着一团团刚从破手套上拆下来的白线，大喊大叫的说：“看哪！我们这些老废物有了用处了！”
    新型的分配方法
    烈、军属把生产搞起来了，不再整年整月依靠国家救济，而是直接享受自己的劳动果实了。可是，有了劳动果实又怎样分配呢？
    他们第一次发工资，是1955年3月16日，二十几个烈、军属，有的工作一天领到七角钱，有的领八角，最多的九角，看起来和别处没有什么不同。但是，这里有些劳动能力强些、事情虽然作得多一点，但是家庭负担不重的，一天只领了七角，分得的钱少些；而有些劳动能力差、家庭负担重的，却领了九角，分得的钱反而多些。
    拿旧的眼光来看，好像不太合理。但是这些烈、军属们都知道这是朱恒昌、陈福顺和魏晋臣几个老年人商量过的，大多数人都认为这样做一定有道理。然而，毕竟还是有人一下没想通。就在第一次分发工资后的生活检讨会上，一个劳动能力略强一点、家庭负担不重的五十多岁的军属张朝卿就问：“这样分发工资能算公平吗？为什么干活少的给钱多？”
    朱恒昌看了看大家，反问张朝卿：“你家几口人？”
    “三口。”张朝卿似懂非懂地就题答问。
    朱恒昌用手指着坐在张朝卿身边七十多岁的宋雨亭，又问张朝卿：“你知道他家几口人不？”
    张朝卿回答说：“六口人。”
    这时候，朱恒昌才解释：“从前咱们都是靠政府救济，现在搞生产了，人口多的多领两角，人口少的就少领两角，这到底是公平呢，还是不公平呢？”
    没等大家说话，张朝卿就抢先说了：“你不早说，早说我不是早就明白啦！不用讨论了。”
    十个钱和一个钱
    一年半以后，军属生产小组在哈尔滨市许多大工厂的帮助下，遵循区委指示的发展道路，发展成军属杂品生产合作社了。这时候，这里发生了有人前来争买羊粪的小风波。
    军属杂品生产合作社从“羊毛粪”里选羊毛，剩下的羊粪很多。1956年春天，天津市郊高庄乡九联农业生产合作社不知怎么听到这里有大批羊粪，他们派人坐着火车跑来了。杂品社和他们订了合同，只要了一点手工钱，算了算，核成二厘钱一斤。九联社在这一年里先后从他们这里运回羊粪七十二万斤，上到田里既能增产，又能灭虫，到秋天水稻丰收，被评为天津市水稻丰产典型社。于是他们两下又商量了，1957年还像原来订的合同那样，他们有多少要多少。就在这不久，北京市一个合作社又来了一位姓熊的同志。这位熊同志到了杂品厂找到了朱恒昌，说：“听说你去年把羊粪卖给天津，是二厘钱一斤；今年好不好另外和我们订个合同，我们加点价，给你二分钱一斤，你看怎么办？”
    还没等熊同志把话说完，朱恒昌就斩钉截铁地回答：“不行，你这么说，就连一斤也不卖给你！我们不爱你十个钱多，也不嫌他一个钱少！”
    熊同志听了这话，神色有点发窘。朱恒昌意识到这样对待远道客人未免过于简单生硬，便作了一些解释。他说：“我们这些烈、军属，从来不光在钱上打主意，搞了一点羊粪，看谁需要就供给谁，让它多起一点作用就行了！”
    熊同志再三解释，说自己原来不该那样提问题。当时朱恒昌考虑到他们是从首都来的，更应该支援，便答应和天津的九联社商量一下，一部分给熊同志运到北京去。没等朱恒昌往天津写信，九联社正巧来人运粪，三方面一起碰了面，就确定了，给北京25％，经天津转运。价钱嘛，仍旧是二厘钱一斤。
    没“原料”找杂品厂
    杂品厂那条僻静的街道，在过去，很少有外面人到这里来的，可是最近半年，远远近近的人都被杂品厂吸引来了。从哈尔滨市内和市郊来的，有许多工人、农民和学生，还有部队驻军。远道来的，不仅有黑龙江省内几十个县的人，而且远在几千里外的大城市、大厂矿，首都北京，包头钢铁公司，也都有人来过。前些天因为客人太多，杂品厂地方太小，他们不得不和近处客人预约，安排次序来参观。
    人们对杂品厂为什么发生这样大的兴趣呢？龙江电工厂原是支援过杂品厂的许多大工厂当中的一个，他们互相间早就建立了很好的友谊。去年有一个时期，龙江电工厂缺少擦机器用的棉纱，一时买不到，杂品厂知道了，马上告诉龙江电工厂一个办法——把擦机器用过的旧棉纱煮一煮、洗一洗，还完全可以代替新的使用。于是龙江电工厂材料供应科的同志们就把成吨的旧棉纱搜集起来，交给杂品厂去加工利用。杂品厂煮下机油来自己使用，洗出棉纱来交给龙江电工厂，这样，把原来擦机器使用一次就扔掉的东西，加工一遍又一遍，利用到第三次、第四次，……直到不能使用为止。龙江电工厂材料供应科的同志们深深受到了一课生动的勤俭办企业的教育，从那以后陆续把六、七种废物利用上了。
    大大小小的许多工厂从这里受到了勤俭办企业的教育，解决了很大的问题。富锦县白铁生产合作社，过去因为原料不足，总是半年开工半年闲。社主任领人来到杂品厂一看，全用铁皮、铁角作原料，制成了很好的镜角、钮扣，就一拍脑袋说：“呀！这些原料，我们扔都没个地方扔，全都埋进地里去了！”看过以后，富锦县白铁生产合作社留下人，在杂品厂学了两星期，学会了制造利用废料做钮扣用的钢模，回去以后，把埋在地里的废料全部挖了出来，再也不因缺少原料而停工了。从那以后，从黑龙江省内各县前来参观学习的人，一天多过一天，来学制造细小金属制品的，来学制造人造棉的，凡是生产上有了困难的小厂、小社，都来了。来这里的人告诉杂品厂说，他们县里领导上告诉他们：“没原料找杂品厂，到哈尔滨杂品厂去看一眼，回来什么都有了！”
    然而，人们从杂品厂学到的东西，还有比这更宝贵的，那就是舍己为人的共产主义风格。
    最高的奖励
    在杂品厂办公室的墙壁上，严严密密挂了几十面锦旗、彩镜。有的是领导机关奖给的，更多的是一些小工厂和农业生产合作社赠送的。人们送来这些锦旗、彩镜，大多数是感谢他们在物质上和技术上的大力支援。
    这样一个专门和“垃圾堆”打交道的小小的杂品厂，论资金只有一万四千元固定资产，十三万五千元流动资金，怎么对这样多的单位进行“大力支援”的呢？
    看他们是怎样“舍己为人”的吧：今年4月，哈尔滨市动手兴办街道工业，道外区崇俭街有几个人，要凭两元多钱的“资金”创办一个铁制器皿生产合作社。他们找到了杂品厂，请他们帮助。
    杂品厂一句二话也没说，工厂理事会几个老年军属研究了一下，就把自己的资金抽出一千元来，又从自己的原料堆里选出一些铁片、铁桶，满满拉了六大马车，一并给了他们。然后，杂品厂又派人到处寻找，垫钱给他们买了一部比市价便宜的完全好用的手摇压力机。朱恒昌对崇俭街办厂的人说：“有什么困难就别找别人了，我们包下！我们知道办厂的难处，我们也是别人帮起来的！”
    很快地，铁制器皿生产合作社办起来了。他们没给杂品厂送什么锦旗、彩镜，却做了另外一件有共产主义风格的事情。在他们刚刚积下一千元资金的时候，街道上又有更多的居民想要白手起家办厂，他们就把这笔钱借了出去，一个厂用过送还了，又借给另一个厂，集中借给一家用不开，就分散开，同时借给几家。崇俭街现在有八十几家街道工厂，其中有五十多家都得到过这个铁制器皿生产合作社的资金帮助。
    铁制器皿生产合作社的负责人说：“我们全社同志在一起研究过几次，没办法表明我们的感激，就决定学习军属杂品厂舍己为人的精神！”
    杂品厂的老主任朱恒昌说：“他们给了我们最高的奖励！”
    军属杂品厂受到了社会上的无限热爱，人们都称它是一所“共产主义大学”。他们这种舍己为人的共产主义精神，在这里如同原子爆炸一样，发生了连锁反应。（附图片）
