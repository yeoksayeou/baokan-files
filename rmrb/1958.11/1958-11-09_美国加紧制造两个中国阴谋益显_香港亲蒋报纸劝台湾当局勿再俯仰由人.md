Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 8th November. Hong Kong's "South China Daily" today published a Taipei dispatch stating that Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek group "diplomatic circles" yesterday told the newspaper's Taiwan-based reporter that Taiwan Kuomintang figures believe that two days after the U.S. Democratic Party won an overwhelming victory in the mid-term elections, the changes in U.S. policy towards the Taiwan authorities "have become visible". This pro-Chiang newspaper quoted the unnamed "diplomatic figure" as saying that this change is that the U.S.'s "support" for the Chiang Kai-shek group "will likely decrease in degree, and will not increase." He said that the U.S. Democratic Party's "support" for the Chiang Kai-shek group is guided by the creation of "two Chinas." At the same time, "Dulles is now leaning towards the 'two Chinas' line." And this U.S. policy "will be opposed by both the Communists and the Nationalists."

This newspaper called on the Taiwan authorities to "rely on their own efforts," arguing that "nothing in the world is more reliable than oneself. It is really undesirable to place hope in others without striving for oneself."

The pro-Chiang "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" today's editorial asks the Taiwan authorities, "Are you content to be forever controlled by so-called friendly parties without any sovereignty?" It believes this is "worthy of serious consideration." And said that the "development" of U.S. policy is "very terrible" for the Taiwan authorities. The editorial believes that "the West's policy of assisting Asia is nothing more than their base-ism." It said that the Taiwan authorities have had "enough lessons" of being subject to others for many years, and if they continue to "remain subservient like in the past, the consequences are unimaginable."

The "Freeman" bi-weekly, published today, said that the communique of the Chiang-Dulles talks and the U.S. interpretation of this communique clearly state that without the consent of the U.S., the Chiang Kai-shek group cannot act alone. As a result, the Taiwan authorities have turned to talking about "implementing a political counter-offensive." This pro-Chiang newspaper said that people related to the Taiwan side feel that "the political counter-offensive under the current circumstances is vague and illusory; and the mood of the [Taiwan] authorities is also quite heavy. This emotion cannot be summarized by the word 'pessimistic'."

    美国加紧制造两个中国阴谋益显
    香港亲蒋报纸劝台湾当局勿再俯仰由人
    新华社香港8日电　香港“南中日报”今天发表台北消息说，台湾蒋介石集团“外交界人士”昨天对这家报纸驻台湾的记者说，台湾国民党人士认为美国民主党在中途选举获得压倒性的胜利两天后，美国对台湾当局政策的变化“已显见轮廓”。这家亲蒋报纸引用这个不愿透露姓名的“外交界人士”的话说，这种变化就是，美国对蒋介石集团的“支持，在程度上，将有减少的可能，而不会有增加的可能”。他说，美国民主党的“支持”蒋介石集团，是以制造“两个中国”为“指针”的。同时，“杜勒斯现在倾向‘两个中国’的路线”。而美国的这种政策“将会遭到国共双方的反对”。
    这家报纸要求台湾当局“自力更生”，认为“天下最可靠的无过于己。将希望寄托在别人身上而不自奋斗，实在要不得”。
    亲蒋的“工商日报”今天的社论询问台湾当局，“就这样安然于永远受着所谓友方的控制而毫无主权吗？”它认为这是“值得严重考虑的”。并说美国政策的“发展”对台湾当局来说是“非常可怕的”。社论认为，“西方的援助亚洲的政策，只不过是它们的基地主义”。它说，台湾当局多年来受制于人的“教训尽够了”，如果今后“一样像过去的俯仰由人，其结果如何，真不堪设想下去”。
    今天出版“自由人”半周刊说，蒋杜会谈公报和美方对这一公报的解释，皆明确说明，没有美方的同意，蒋介石集团是不能单独行动的。于是，台湾当局又转过来谈“实行政治反攻”了。这家亲蒋报纸说，同台湾方面有关的人对“现在这种情况下的政治反攻，却感到渺茫，空幻；而（台湾）当局的心情，也颇为沉重。这种情绪不是用‘悲观’两个字可以概括的”。
