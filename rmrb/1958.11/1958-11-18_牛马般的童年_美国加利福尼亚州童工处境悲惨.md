	A Childhood Like Beasts of Burden
	The Miserable Plight of Child Labor in California, USA
	In California, USA, the employment of child labor is legally prohibited. However, in the orchards along the Santa Clara Valley Highway and in the fields of the Imperial Valley, many children can be seen working alongside adults, busy picking fruit and harvesting crops. These children, like their parents, are temporary employees of the farm owners.
	According to the farm owners, their employment of child labor is entirely for "good." Because it allows children to work with their parents on light tasks, making a "contribution" to the family income and "improving the family situation."
	Are these farm owners really so concerned about the workers "improving their family situation"? Obviously, this is complete nonsense. Recent materials published by the American "People's World" expose how cruelly the farm owners exploit the workers. For example, a woman named Alisa said that four of her family of six often work, but the income is barely enough to feed the family. Another female worker, Irene, said, "I work like a dog… but the income is only enough to buy some food from the grocery store." In fact, it is precisely the farm owners' cruel exploitation that makes the workers' families extremely poor, so even the workers' children have to work like beasts of burden for the bosses.
	The "People's World" materials reveal that the work these children do on the farms is very heavy. Due to their inability to cope, work-related injuries occur frequently. For example, on September 22 this year, in a vineyard in San Jose County, a six-year-old girl named Maria was crushed to death by a grape-hauling trailer. Such tragedies are not isolated cases. According to a report by Jefferson, head of the Labor Statistics and Research Division of the California Department of Industrial Relations, more than 500 work-related injuries to child farmworkers occurred in California last year. The main reasons were due to excessively long working hours and harsh working conditions. For example, a girl picking strawberries was seriously injured after falling from a truck due to overwork, as she had to work 54 hours a week for the boss.
	This plight of child farmworkers in California is not uncommon in the United States. In fact, in the United States under the rule of monopoly capital, the children of the working people live a childhood no better than that of beasts of burden.

    牛马般的童年
    美国加利福尼亚州童工处境悲惨
    在美国加利福尼亚州，根据法律规定，雇用童工是被禁止的。但是，在这个州的圣塔·克拉拉山谷公路两旁的果园里，在因柏里谷地的田野上，人们可以看到许多孩子和大人一起忙着收摘果物和收割庄稼。这些孩子，和他们的父母一样，都是农场老板的临时雇工。
    根据农场老板们的说法，他们雇用童工完全是为了做“好事”。因为，这使孩子们能和父母在一起干一些轻松的活，对家庭收入能有“贡献”，可以“改善家庭境况”。
    这些农场的老板们真的这样关心工人们“改善家庭境况”吗？显然，这完全是鬼话。最近美国“人民世界报”发表的一些材料，揭露了农场老板们是怎样残酷地剥削工人的。例如，有一位名叫艾利莎的妇女说：她一家大小六口经常有四个人工作，但是收入却仅够一家人糊口。另一位女工伊莲尼说，“我像一条狗似的干活……可是收入只够上杂货铺买点吃的。”事实上，正是农场老板们的残酷剥削使得工人家庭境况极端恶劣，因此连工人们的孩子也不得不像牛马一样为老板们干活。
    “人民世界报”的材料揭露说，这些孩子们在农场里所干的活是十分繁重的。由于力不胜任，于是工伤事故经常发生。例如，今年9月22日，山哲尔县一个葡萄园里，一个只有六岁的女孩玛利亚，就被运葡萄的拖车轧死了。这种惨剧并不是个别现象。据加州工业关系部劳工统计研究司负责人杰森逊在一份报告中承认，去年加利福尼亚州共发生五百余起农场童工工伤事故。主要原因是由于工作时间太长和工作条件恶劣。例如，一个摘草莓的女孩，由于每周要为老板工作五十四小时，疲劳过度，因而从卡车上摔下来而受了重伤。
    加利福尼亚州农场童工的这种遭遇，在美国并不是少见的事。事实上，在垄断资本统治下的美国，劳动人民的子弟所过的都不过是牛马般的童年。
