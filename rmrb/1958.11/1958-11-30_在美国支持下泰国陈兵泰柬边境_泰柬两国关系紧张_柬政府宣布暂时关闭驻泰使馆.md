Xinhua News Agency, November 28th, Bangkok dispatch: The Thai Ministry of Interior announced today that all foreigners, regardless of whether they hold formal valid passports, will not be allowed to enter Thailand from Cambodia.

This is a new action taken by the Thai government, with the connivance and support of the United States, to create tension with Cambodia. Prior to this, Thailand had already announced the closure of the Thai-Cambodian border on the 25th. Sarit Thanarat, the head of the Thai "Revolutionary Council" who launched a military coup on the evening of October 20th, subsequently ordered a full "alert" on the Thai-Cambodian border on the 27th. Sarit himself had also visited the Thai-Cambodian border twice, and declared that the Thai armed forces were prepared to "repel intrusions and resist aggression" in the Thai-Cambodian border area. According to Western news agencies today, Thai armed forces are continuing to move towards the Thai-Cambodian border.

The above actions of the Thai government were taken after Thai radio announced on the 25th that Cambodia had decided to temporarily sever diplomatic relations with Thailand. According to the radio broadcast, the Cambodian ambassador to Thailand had sent a note to the Thai government on the 24th, announcing the Cambodian government's decision to temporarily sever diplomatic relations with Thailand from December 1st. It was reported that the Cambodian ambassador to Thailand pointed out that Cambodia made this decision because Thailand was conducting malicious propaganda, which has worsened relations between the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 28th: The Royal Government of Cambodia issued a communique today, announcing the temporary closure of the Cambodian Embassy in Thailand.

The communique elaborated on the reasons for taking "this regrettable, but well-considered measure," and traced the deterioration of relations between Cambodia and Thailand. The communique stated that Thai police also arrested and searched Cambodian citizens holding legal visas on the pretext that Cambodia was a "source of communist subversion"; Thai newspapers and radio stations insulted the Cambodian royal family, national leaders, and even the Khmer nation in an unprecedentedly rude manner every day.

The communique said that in view of Thailand's deliberate sabotage of friendly ties between Cambodia and Thailand, the Royal Government of Cambodia believes that it is no longer meaningful to continue to maintain diplomatic representation in Thailand, and therefore has to order its diplomatic representatives to temporarily withdraw. The communique stated that this decision will not affect the strictly neutral policy pursued by the Kingdom of Cambodia and its desire to maintain friendly relations with all countries that are willing to respect its independence, system, and traditions. This action of the Royal Government of Cambodia is merely a peaceful means taken to maintain its national dignity, which is constantly attacked and insulted.

The communique said that the Royal Government of Cambodia announced that it is always willing to maintain good neighborly and friendly relations with Thailand. When the time comes, the Royal Government of Cambodia will never refuse to restore normal relations between the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 27th: According to the Cambodian National Radio tonight, citing a notice issued by the Cambodian Cabinet, 5,000 residents of Koh Kong District in Kampot Province, Cambodia, recently held a series of demonstrations to protest the slander of Thai newspapers.

    在美国支持下泰国陈兵泰柬边境
    泰柬两国关系紧张
    柬政府宣布暂时关闭驻泰使馆
    据新华社28日讯　曼谷消息：泰国内政部今天宣布，所有外国人，不论是否持有正式有效的护照，都将不准从柬埔寨进入泰国。
    这是泰国在美国的纵容和支持下制造同柬埔寨之间的紧张关系以来，泰国政府所采取的新的行动。在这以前，泰国已经在25日宣布封锁泰柬边境，在10月20日晚间发动军事政变的泰国“革命委员会”首脑乃沙立随即在27日下令在泰柬边境实行全面“戒备”。乃沙立本人还曾经两度前往泰柬边境视察，并且宣称泰国三军准备在泰柬边境一带“击退进犯和抵御侵略”。据西方通讯社今天报道，泰国武装部队目前继续向泰柬边境调动。
    泰国政府的上述行动，是在25日泰国电台宣布柬埔寨决定同泰国暂时断绝外交关系以后，陆续采取的。据这家电台广播，柬埔寨驻泰国大使曾经在24日照会泰国政府，宣布柬埔寨政府决定从12月1日起暂时断绝同泰国之间的外交关系。据报道，柬埔寨驻泰国大使曾指出，柬埔寨作出这一决定，是由于泰国进行恶意宣传，使柬泰两国间的关系趋于恶化。
    新华社金边28日电　柬埔寨王国政府今天发表公报，宣布暂时关闭柬埔寨驻泰国大使馆。
    公报阐述了采取“这种令人遗憾的、但是经过周密考虑的措施”的原因，并且追溯了柬埔寨同泰国关系恶化的过程。公报说，泰国警察还以柬埔寨是“共产党颠复策源地”为借口，逮捕和搜查持有合法签证的柬埔寨公民；泰国报纸和电台每天空前粗暴地侮辱柬埔寨王室、国家领导人、甚至高棉民族。
    公报说，鉴于泰国故意破坏柬泰两国之间的友好联系，柬埔寨王国政府认为在泰国继续设立外交代表已经失去意义，因而不得不命令它的外交代表暂时撤回。公报说，这个决定丝毫不影响柬埔寨王国奉行的严格中立政策和它同一切愿意尊重它的独立、制度和传统的国家保持友好关系的愿望。柬埔寨王国政府的这一行动仅仅是为了保持它的不断受到攻击和侮辱的民族尊严而采取的和平手段。
    公报说，柬埔寨王国政府宣布始终愿意同泰国保持良好的睦邻和友好关系。在时间到来的时候，柬埔寨王国政府决不拒绝恢复两国之间的正常关系。
    据新华社金边27日电　据柬埔寨国家电台今晚援引柬埔寨内阁发表的公告说，柬埔寨唝吥省戈公区的五千居民最近举行了一系列的示威，抗议泰国报纸的诽谤。
