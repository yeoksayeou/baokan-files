    Full House of Descendants
    In the Bayanburid Pastoral Cooperative of the Xini River, in the Evenk Autonomous Banner, there is a 72-year-old man named Moheni. He has seven grandchildren, the oldest being ten years old, six of whom were born after 1951.
    Ten years ago, this was a place where the sound of a baby's cry was rarely heard. Moheni's sons, Dengba'erle and Bala Dao'erji, had three or four children, some of whom died within a few days due to venereal diseases, and others who contracted tetanus from old-fashioned midwifery. Old man Moheni felt lonely, and his eldest son, Dengba'erle, in desperation, adopted a child, who is now the eldest child, Sèlì Jímǐdégé.
    From 1951 onwards, the Party and the People's Government sent venereal disease prevention and treatment teams to drive away the disease, and vigorously promoted modern midwifery, ensuring that every child born lived, leading to the joyful days of a full house of descendants today.

    子孙满堂
    在鄂温克族自治旗锡尼河畔巴音布日德牧业社里，有一位叫莫赫尼的七十二岁的老人，他有七个孙子，最大的一个十岁，其中有六个是在1951年以后生的。
    十年前，这是一个连婴儿哭泣的声音都很难听到的地方。莫赫尼老人的儿子——登巴尔勒和巴拉道尔吉兄弟俩，曾有过三、四个孩子，有的因性病，有的因旧法接生患了破伤风等病症，生下来不几天都死掉了。莫赫尼老人感到生活孤寂，大儿子登巴尔勒在绝望中向别人要了一个孩子，这就是大孩子色力吉米德格。
    从1951年开始，党和人民政府派出性病防治工作队，为他们驱逐了病魔，并大力推行了新法接生，生一个活一个，才有了今天子孙满堂的欢乐日子。
