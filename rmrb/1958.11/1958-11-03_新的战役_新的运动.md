    New Battle, New Movement
    In the previous period, the main focus in industry was on grasping smelting equipment for steel. Now, this task can be said to be basically resolved, and it is necessary to promptly shift to the next central task and organize a new mass movement.

    This new center, this new movement, is to fully arm the steel industry: at the front end, focus on the mechanization of mines, to save manpower as much as possible and ensure a regular and stable supply of ore to the blast furnaces; at the rear end, focus on steel rolling equipment, to turn all the produced steel ingots into steel products, so that the growth of steel production can fully play its role in production.

    The machinery industry sector, recognizing this new situation, promptly deployed new central tasks. They saw it accurately and grasped it quickly, and can be called "outstanding individuals" who "understand the times." However, it is not enough for the machinery industry sector to act on its own initiative. More importantly, party organizations at all levels need to recognize this situation and mobilize the whole people to grasp this center. Only in this way can this central task form a movement and be resolved quickly and thoroughly.

    新的战役　新的运动
    前一时期在工业方面，主要是抓钢铁的冶炼设备。现在这个任务，可以说已经基本上解决了，需要及时转移到下一个中心任务上面去，组织一个新的群众运动。
    这个新的中心、新的运动就是把钢铁工业全副武装起来：在前面这一头，抓矿山的机械化，以尽量节省人力，保证能够经常地稳定地给高炉供应矿石；在后面这一头，抓轧钢设备，把所有生产出来的钢锭都变成钢材，使钢产量的增长在生产上充分发挥效果。
    机械工业部门认清了这个新形势，及时部署了新的中心工作，看得准，抓得快，称得上是“识时务”的“俊杰”。但是，仅仅机械工业部门自动起来是不够的。更重要的是需要各级党组织都认清这个形势，发动全民来抓这个中心。这样，这个中心工作才能够形成运动，才能够解决得迅速和透彻。
