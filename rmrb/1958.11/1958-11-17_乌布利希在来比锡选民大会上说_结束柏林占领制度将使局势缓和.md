Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 15th: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Union Party of Germany and First Deputy Prime Minister, said at a voters' meeting in Leipzig on the 14th: "If the signatories of the Potsdam Agreement abandon the remnants of the occupation regime in Berlin, the tension in Berlin will ease, and Berlin will be transformed into a peaceful city."
    He also said: "If the United States, Britain, and France wish to preserve their legitimate interests already existing in West Berlin, then it is possible for representatives of the three Western powers to consult with the government of the German Democratic Republic on all issues, including the issue of their lines of communication through the territory of the German Democratic Republic."
    The German Democratic Republic will hold its third general election on the 16th. Ulbricht and other party and government leaders have once again met with voters in various places. Khrushchev's proposal on the Berlin issue has become one of the main topics of their conversations.
    Ulbricht pointed out that Khrushchev's speech pointed out the only realistic path for the people of West Germany, which is to prepare for a German peace treaty and the establishment of a confederation of two German states.
    Ulbricht believes that if the Western countries had complied with the Potsdam Agreement, the division of Germany would not have occurred at all. He said: Now there is only one way out: that is, to create democratic conditions through the strength of the workers and people of West Germany that will enable the two German states to negotiate. The West German authorities want to use the banner of "German reunification" as a cover to conduct general elections under the conditions of atomic armament and under the pressure of American occupiers. We must expose this trick.

    乌布利希在来比锡选民大会上说
    结束柏林占领制度将使局势缓和
    新华社柏林15日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记、第一副总理乌布利希14日在来比锡的选民大会上说：“如果波茨坦协定的签字国放弃在柏林的占领制度的残余，柏林的紧张局势将会和缓，柏林将转变为一个和平的城市。”
    他又说：“如果美英法三国希望保住他们在西柏林已有的正当的利益的话，那么西方三国的代表是有可能同德意志民主共和国政府协商一切问题的，包括它们通过德意志民主共和国地区的联络线的问题。”
    民主德国将在16日进行第三次大选的投票。乌布利希和其他党政领导人都再次到各地同选民会见。赫鲁晓夫关于柏林问题的建议成为他们谈话的主要内容之一。
    乌布利希指出，赫鲁晓夫的讲话给西德人民指出了一条唯一现实的道路，这就是准备对德和约和成立两个德国的邦联。
    乌布利希认为，要是西方国家遵守了波茨坦协定的话，那就根本不会出现德国的分裂了。他说：现在只有一条出路：即通过西德的工人和人民的力量造成能够使两个德国谈判的民主条件。西德当局想以“德国统一”的招牌作为掩饰，在原子武装的条件和在美国占领者的压力下进行普选。我们要揭穿这个诡计。
