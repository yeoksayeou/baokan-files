Xinhua News Agency, 4th. A grand China-Soviet friendship soiree was held in the capital this evening to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

More than 3,000 people attended tonight's soiree. In the banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel, Chinese and foreign friends gathered together, filled with enthusiasm, singing and dancing, as close as family. Among those attending tonight's soiree were people from all walks of life in the capital, Soviet experts and experts from other fraternal countries stationed in the capital, responsible staff members of the Soviet Embassy, and Soviet and fraternal countries' students studying in Beijing. It was a joyous evening, with people singing the song "Moscow-Beijing" in different languages, celebrating the great October Revolution Day that opened a new era for all mankind.

Cao Jinghua, Council Member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and Vice President of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, extended the warmest festive greetings to Soviet comrades and comrades from other fraternal countries at this friendship-filled evening. Cao Jinghua said, "The Great October Revolution Day is a common festival for all socialist countries, working people all over the world, and progressive humanity. The people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, and the people of other fraternal countries have all achieved victory along the path of the October Revolution and are now fighting shoulder to shoulder for the realization of socialism and communism. The great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union and the people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union is as solid as steel and as eternal as the sun and moon. Relying on our close unity and mutual support, we can overcome all difficulties and defeat all imperialists who dare to invade."

Cao Jinghua expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet and other fraternal countries' experts. He said: For the cause of China's socialist construction, you have come far from your hometowns, and you regard China's construction as the construction of your own motherland, contributing all your wisdom, experience and energy. Your noble spirit of internationalism is our example to learn from. The contributions you have made to our country's construction will always be remembered by the Chinese people.

Tonight's soiree was jointly organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the State Council Bureau of Foreign Experts, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Beijing Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League.
