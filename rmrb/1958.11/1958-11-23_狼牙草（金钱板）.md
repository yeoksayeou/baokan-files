    Wolf Tooth Grass
    (Clapper Talk)
    Zeng Tianjia
    There was a Volunteer Army soldier named Xu Can,
    Carrying out a mission, he sneaked to the enemy's front lines,
    To blow up the bridge!
    Cutting off the retreat route so that our great army could wipe out the enemy.
    Suddenly a shell came flying,
    A gust of wind knocked him to the side,
    His wound was painful and his body weak,
    He slept drowsily for a long time.
    After waking up, he didn't dare open his eyes immediately,
    Afraid of falling into the hands of the enemy and causing trouble.
    He only felt a light flashing before his eyes,
    Someone was prying open his mouth.
    Sticky, warm water was poured in,
    Tasted like honey, sweet and sweet,
    He also heard someone sighing in his ear,
    The voice was full of sympathy and love.
    Xu Can thought: The enemy wouldn't do this,
    It must be a Korean local who saved me.
    He couldn't help but open his eyes to take a look,
    Seeing an Ah Ma Ni sitting in front of a brazier.
    She had a worried look on her face as she was doing needlework,
    Turning her head to look at him from time to time.
    She looked a little over fifty years old,
    Her hair was gray, but her body was healthy.
    "Ma-Ma," he couldn't help but whisper,
    Ah Ma Ni's face immediately showed a smile,
    Gesturing for him not to talk,
    To rest well and not move.
    From the brazier, she took a small bowl,
    Steaming rice soup was filled inside,
    And brought a small packet of yellow medicine powder,
    Mixing it evenly inside.
    After mixing, it was applied to his wound,
    And then layer upon layer of bandages were wrapped around it.
    It was like a magic pill, really effective,
    The wound didn't hurt, and his mind was clear like before.
    This made Little Xu Can very happy,
    Wanting to thank Mama, but unable to speak.
    Ah Ma Ni's eyes were bright,
    As if her own son was getting better, she was happy at heart.
    Suddenly, Xu Can remembered something,
    The task of blowing up the bridge was not yet completed.
    He hurriedly turned over and stood up,
    To blow up the bridge, he had to seize the time.
    Ah Ma Ni guessed what he was thinking,
    Her eyes were moist, but she didn't stop him.
    Turning around, she brought a bowl of rice soup:
    "Drink it, child, be careful!"
    "Thank you, Mama," Xu Can's voice trembled,
    After drinking the soup, he walked out the door.
    At this time, the north wind was tight, and the sky was dark,
    Gusts of cold air drilled into his body,
    Xu Can hurried forward step by step,
    Before long, a big bridge appeared in front of him.
    Two devils were standing guard on the bridgehead,
    So cold that they were stamping their feet and shrinking their shoulders.
    Xu Can found a hidden spot by the bridge,
    Preparing to start setting up the explosives,
    Suddenly a flashlight shone brightly,
    Looking like it was about to shine under the bridge,
    Xu Can thought: What to do?
    If discovered, he would have to fight it out.
    Just as he was anxious, the sentry suddenly shouted:
    "Who is it? Stand there, don't move forward!"
    Xu Can thought he had been discovered,
    And was about to throw a grenade onto the bridge.
    "It's me, boss, please have mercy,
    Let me cross the bridge, don't stop me,
    My daughter is about to give birth,
    No one to take care of her, I'm afraid she's not safe!"
    In the darkness, a white headscarf was faintly visible,
    It turned out that Ah Ma Ni had come to the bridge.
    In order to make Xu Can's work smooth and less dangerous,
    She came to use a clever plan to lure the tiger away from the mountain.
    "Who cares about your giving birth or not,
    This is a military area, you are not allowed to wander around,"
    One devil kicked her in the waist,
    Another devil pushed her shoulder hard.
    She turned around and hadn't gone far,
    Suddenly, crackling gunshots shook the space...
    Little Xu Can was so angry that his whole body trembled,
    He was worried about whether Ah Ma Ni was safe?
    Thanks to her for diverting the devils' attention,
    He was able to get through this emergency. …
    He quickly set up the explosives and lit the fuse,
    And hurriedly ran out of the danger zone.
    Only to hear a loud bang and a flash of fire,
    Stones and wood chips flew into the sky.
    Xu Can ran and shouted Ah Ma Ni’s name,
    Suddenly a bullet hit his left leg,
    He fell into the ditch,
    Only felt dizzy and lightheaded. …
    He woke up and found himself in a field hospital,
    The political instructor was standing in front of the bed.
    "Comrade Xu Can, thanks to you for blowing up the bridge,
    The devils on the other side of the bridge were completely wiped out..."
    Xu Can burst into tears when he heard this,
    Before he could speak, he felt a pang in his heart,
    He told the story of Ah Ma Ni,
    Without her, my life would have been in danger...
    The political instructor nodded as he listened,
    His smiling face immediately turned into a worried one.
    People were sent to the village to look for Ah Ma Ni,
    But she could not be found anywhere.
    Just as everyone was anxiously unable to think of a way,
    An old lady and a translator walked in,
    He said he was entrusted by Ah Ma Ni to come and see,
    To see if Comrade Xu was safely back.
    She said that Ah Ma Ni was shot by the enemy,
    And ran with serious injuries to my door…
    Before she died, she was still concerned about Comrade Xu,
    And asked me to send wolf tooth grass powder without delay.
    The old lady took out a packet of medicine powder from her body,
    She said this is a miraculous cure for gunshot wounds...
    The more the old lady said, the more her voice trembled,
    Two lines of tears wet the front of her clothes.
    The comrades were saddened by her words,
    Little Xu Can couldn't stop his tears.
    It was as if an arrow pierced his chest,
    It was like thunder shook his ears.
    He suddenly raised his head and opened his eyes,
    As if he saw auspicious clouds rising to the ninth heaven,
    Ah Ma Ni was standing on the clouds,
    Smiling and nodding, wanting to speak.
    Could it be that she is worried and came to see me?
    Could it be that she is instructing me to kill the enemy and avenge her?
    Little Xu Can raised his hand and shouted loudly to the sky:
    Mama, Mother, he cried several times,
    Your son vows to you,
    Rest assured in heaven,
    I won't be called Xu Can if I don't defeat the American devils,
    I will never return alive if I don't eliminate the American devils!
    Little Xu Can was crying sadly there,
    The political instructor spoke with pain on the side:
    "Comrade Xu Can, don't be too sad,
    We will always remember Ah Ma Ni's kindness in our hearts,
    We vow to avenge Ah Ma Ni,
    We will never return until we drive away the invaders!"
    This is a section of the "Wolf Tooth Grass" Clapper Talk,
    Praising the friendship between China and North Korea for ten thousand years!

    狼牙草
    （金钱板）
    曾田家
    有一个志愿军战士叫徐灿，
    执行任务摸到了敌人前沿，
    为的是要把桥梁来炸断！
    切断后路以便大军把敌歼。
    猛然间飞来了一颗炮弹，
    一阵风把他摔倒在一边，
    他伤口发痛身体软，
    昏沉沉睡了大半天。
    苏醒后他不敢立刻睁开眼，
    怕的是落在敌人手里可麻烦。
    他只觉得眼前灯光闪，
    是谁在把他的嘴巴搬。
    粘糊糊的热水往里灌，
    味似蜂蜜甜又甜，
    耳边又听得有人把气叹，
    声音里充满同情和爱怜。
    徐灿想：是敌人不会这样办，
    一定是朝鲜老乡把我救回还。
    他忍不住睁开眼睛看一看，
    见一个阿妈尼坐在火盆前。
    她面带忧愁在把针线活干，
    不时掉头望着他这边。
    看年纪五十多一点，
    头发斑白身体却健全。
    “妈—妈”他情不由己轻声喊，
    阿妈尼脸上立刻露笑颜，
    打手势叫他不要把话谈，
    好好休息莫动弹。
    从火盆上她取下一个小碗，
    热腾腾的米汤装在里边，
    又取来一小包黄色药面，
    均均匀匀往里掺。
    调好后敷在他伤口上面，
    外面一层一层又把绷带缠。
    好比仙丹妙药真灵验，
    伤口不疼头脑清醒像从前。
    这可喜坏了小徐灿，
    要感谢妈妈欲说又无言。
    阿妈尼眼睛亮闪闪，
    就像是她亲儿病好心喜欢。
    猛然间徐灿想起事一件，
    炸桥的任务没有完。
    他急忙翻身往下站，
    要炸桥必须要争取时间。
    阿妈尼猜透了他的心眼，
    她眼睛润湿却不阻拦。
    转过身她端上米汤一碗：
    “喝了吧，孩子，要注意安全！”
    “谢谢你，妈妈，”徐灿声音打颤，
    喝了汤他就走出门外边。
    这时候北风正紧天昏暗，
    阵阵寒气身上钻，
    徐灿一步一步向前赶，
    不多久一座大桥出现在眼前。
    桥头上两个鬼子把岗站，
    直冷得顿着脚来缩着肩。
    在桥边徐灿找了一个隐蔽点，
    准备开始把炸药安，
    忽然间电棒光亮闪，
    看看就要照到桥下边，
    徐灿心想：这可怎么办？
    被发现就只好拼上一番。
    正着急哨兵忽然把话喊：
    “是谁？站着，不许向前！”
    徐灿以为自己被发现，
    正要把手榴弹甩到桥上边。
    “是我，老总，请开恩典，
    让我过桥莫阻拦，
    我的女儿快生产，
    无人照顾怕不安全！”
    黑暗中白头巾若隐若现，
    原来是阿妈尼来到桥前。
    为了使徐灿工作顺利少危险，
    她前来使妙计调虎离山。
    “谁管你什么生产不生产，
    军事重地不准你胡乱窜，”
    一个鬼子脚踢她腰杆，
    一个鬼子猛推她的肩。
    她回转身还没走多远，
    忽听得啪啪枪声震空间。……
    小徐灿直气得浑身打颤，
    他担心阿妈尼是否平安？
    多亏她把鬼子注意力分散，
    他才能过了这紧急难关。……
    他迅速安好炸药点上导火线，
    急忙忙跑出危险圈。
    只听得轰隆一声火光闪，
    石头木片飞上天。
    徐灿一面跑一面把阿妈尼喊，
    忽然一颗子弹打中他左腿弯，
    他翻身栽倒沟里面，
    只觉得头昏目又眩。……
    醒来发现自己住在野战医院，
    床面前站着教导员。
    “徐灿同志多亏你把桥炸断，
    桥那边鬼子被全歼……”
    徐灿一听泪满面，
    未曾开言心里酸，
    他把阿妈尼事迹讲一遍，
    没有她我的性命难保全。……
    教导员一面听一面把头点，
    笑颜立刻变愁颜。
    派人村里去把阿妈尼找，
    四面八方找不见。
    大家正在焦愁无法想，
    走进来一个老大娘和翻译员，
    他说受阿妈尼委托来看看，
    看徐同志是不是平安转回还。
    她说阿妈尼中了敌人枪弹，
    带着重伤跑到了我家门前……
    临死前她还把徐同志挂念，
    叫我送来狼牙草粉不得迟延。
    老大娘从身上取出一包药面，
    她说这是治枪伤妙药灵丹……
    老大娘越说声音越打颤，
    两行泪水淋湿了她胸前衣衫。
    同志们听她言个个伤感，
    小徐灿在一旁珠泪不干。
    好似胸中穿利箭，
    好似巨雷震耳边。
    他猛抬头睁眼看，
    仿佛看见祥云冉冉升九天，
    阿妈尼就在云头站，
    含笑点头想开言。
    莫不是她不放心来把我看？
    莫不是嘱我杀敌报仇冤？
    小徐灿举手向空高声喊：
    妈妈啊，娘啊，叫了几番，
    你儿对你发誓愿，
    你在天上把心宽，
    不打垮美国鬼儿不叫徐灿，
    不消灭美国鬼儿决不生还！
    小徐灿在那里正哭得凄惨，
    教导员在一旁忍痛把话谈：
    “徐灿同志，你不要过于伤感，
    阿妈尼恩德我们永记心间，
    为阿妈尼报仇我们立誓愿，
    不赶走侵略者决不回还！”
    这就是“狼牙草”快板书一段，
    歌颂那中朝友谊万万年！
  （根据朝鲜作家金永植同名小说改编）
