Run Childcare Centers Allows Laboring Women to Produce with Peace of Mind
Qinghai Holds Childcare Work Conference

Xining Dispatch: The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the first provincial childcare work conference from the 5th to the 10th of this month. The conference focused on discussing how to consolidate and improve childcare organizations on the basis of popularization. Participants included county and township Party committee secretaries, commune directors, women's federation directors, and childcare center representatives from six ethnic groups, including Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, Tu, and Salar.

Qinghai Province has established 9,876 childcare organizations, with over 85% of children who should be in care being accommodated. According to surveys, there are 340,000 female laborers in the province, of which over 200,000 have children. With the widespread establishment of childcare centers and kindergartens, about 200,000 women, apart from those engaged in childcare work, have been freed from the burden of looking after children and can fully demonstrate their abilities on the fronts of industrial and agricultural production. Children are also receiving collective upbringing.

At the conference, experiences in running childcare centers were widely exchanged. Everyone had a clear understanding of the important significance of childcare work and was determined to do a good job in cultivating communist successors.
