New Communist Spirit
By Our Correspondent Zhou Zhesheng

    Sending an Umbrella in the Rain
    After two consecutive heavy rains, the roofs of the barracks at the autumn sowing battlefield of the Huangquan People's Commune in Donghai County, Jiangsu Province, leaked due to the thin sorghum stalks, affecting the rest of the soldiers. To repair the roofs, they needed sorghum stalks. As the commander of the battlefield corps was worrying, the telephone on the table rang. Shi Dengshan, the deputy commander of the corps, picked up the receiver and heard clearly: "Hello! Is this old Shi? This is Henan. We heard that your barracks are leaking and you urgently need sorghum stalks. Our soldiers here suggest sending you 10,000 catties. If you can't spare manpower to carry them, we'll send someone over immediately." "That's great, it's like sending an umbrella in the rain! Thank you for your concern, we'll send people to move them," Shi Dengshan said excitedly.
    Soon, the sorghum stalks were transported from the Baita People's Commune on the south bank of the Lunan River to the north bank. The battlefield corps used this batch of sorghum stalks to reinforce the dozens of leaking barracks that night, ensuring the soldiers' sleep.
    The Baita People's Commune and the Huangquan People's Commune are only separated by a river. At the beginning of the autumn sowing, the two sides issued battle statements and launched a competition to complete the autumn sowing quickly and well. On this day, when they heard that their opponent's house was leaking in the continuous rain, the Baita Commune did not have the intention of taking advantage of the situation to win. They decided to send all 10,000 catties of sorghum stalks, which were reserved for building the canteen, to the opposing competitor. The cadres and masses of this commune said: Competition is not simply a matter of who defeats whom, but for increasing the production of wheat next year, everyone must leap forward. Chen Jiafu of the Huangquan Commune was most moved by this incident. He pointed to the scar on his leg and said to the cadres: "If the commune had been established earlier and ideological understanding had been raised earlier, my leg would not have been injured!" It turned out that in 1956, Chen Jiafu went to Henan to cut grass, which caused a dispute, and he was beaten by members of the Buhou Brigade of the current Baita Commune.

    Other People's Difficulties Are Our Own
    More than 20,000 mu of soybeans in the Baozhuang People's Commune were generally ripe, and a few bean pods had cracked. If they were not harvested quickly, the losses would be even greater. However, at that time, they also had to plow the land and carry out autumn sowing, and the labor force was very tight and could not handle it. Seeing this situation, the tens of thousands of water conservancy expeditionary forces from the various people's communes on the nearby Xuzhou-Haizhou Canal construction site sacrificed their evening sleep to help harvest the soybeans. The members of the Pingming People's Commune, who came from a hundred miles away, said well: Other people's difficulties are our own difficulties. Even if our eyelids are drooping, we must get the soybeans back home. With the assistance of the brother commune members for two nights, all the more than 20,000 mu of soybeans in the Baozhuang People's Commune were harvested, achieving a bumper harvest.

    Distant Fields Become Near Fields
    After the people's communes were established, the Rural Work Department of the Donghai County Committee of the Communist Party of China reduced a complicated and headache-inducing matter, namely, the handling of disputes over intermingled fields.
    Originally, many small cooperatives had dozens or even two or three thousand mu of cross-township fields and distant fields. During the cooperativization stage, although many consultations were conducted and some adjustments and exchanges were made, due to the large number of units and the serious localism, everyone was afraid of suffering losses, and it had not been handled well. The output of these fields was about 50% lower than that of ordinary fields, and they had long been third-class fields. After the establishment of the people's communes, the communist ideology of cadres and masses was raised, and they no longer haggled over petty gains. Cross-township fields have been eliminated, and more than 40,000 mu of distant fields in the county have become near fields, providing conditions for large-scale bumper harvests.
    In Donghai County, northern Jiangsu, this communist style of great collaboration is becoming increasingly popular.

    共产主义新风气
    本报记者  周哲生
    雨中送伞
    连下两场大雨，江苏东海县黄圈人民公社秋种野战兵团驻地的营房，屋顶因秫秸稍薄而漏雨，影响到战士们的休息。修屋吧，没有秫秸。兵团的指挥员正在焦愁，桌上的电话铃响了。兵团副团长时登善拿起电话筒，清晰地听到：“喂！你是老时吧？我是河南呀，听说你们营房漏雨，急需秫秸，我们这里战士们的意见，送一万斤给你们，你们腾不出人手来挑，我们马上派人送过去。”“太好了，简直是雨中送伞！谢谢你们关心，我们去人搬。”时登善很激动。
    一会儿，秫秸从鲁南河南岸的白塔人民公社运到北岸，这个野战兵团就用这批秫秸把漏雨的几十间营房当晚加盖好，保证了战士们的睡眠。
    白塔人民公社和黄圈人民公社仅一河之隔，秋种开始时，双方下了战表，开展以又快又好完成秋种为内容的竞赛。这天，听到对手破屋偏遭连夜雨的事，白塔公社并没有乘人之危而取胜的心思，他们决定把留作搭食堂用的一万斤秫秸，全部送给竞赛的对方。这个公社的干部和群众说：竞赛，不单是谁战胜谁就了事，而是为了明年三麦增产，大家都跃进。黄圈公社的陈家富对这件事最为感动，他指着腿上的伤痕对干部说：“要是公社早成立，思想认识早提高，我的腿也不会被打伤！”原来在1956年时，陈家富到河南割草，引起纠纷，曾被现在的白塔公社埠后大队社员们打伤。
    人家的困难就是自己的
    包庄人民公社有两万多亩豆子普遍成熟了，少数豆荚裂开，如不抢收，损失更大。可是当时又要翻地，又要秋种，劳力十分紧张，顾不过来。正在邻近包庄徐（州）海（州）运河工地上的各个人民公社的上万名水利远征大军，目睹这种情况，他们便牺牲了晚间的睡眠，帮助收摘豆子。来自一百里路外的平明人民公社的社员们说得好：人家的困难就是自己的困难，任眼皮打架，也要使豆子颗粒还家。经过兄弟公社社员两个夜晚的协助，包庄人民公社的两万多亩豆子全部登场，达到丰产丰收。
    远田变近田
    人民公社化以后，中共东海县委农村工作部减少了一件复杂而又头痛的事务，即关于插花田的纠纷的处理。
    原来许多小社，都有几十亩以至两三千亩跨乡田和远田，在合作化阶段，虽然进行多次协商，作了一些调整调换，但由于单位多，本位主义严重，都怕吃亏，一直没有很好处理。这些田产量都低于一般田的50％左右，长期是三类田。人民公社建立以后，干部和群众的共产主义思想提高了，不再斤斤计较，跨乡田已经消灭，全县四万多亩远田都变了近田，为大面积丰产提供了条件。
    在江苏北部东海县，这种共产主义大协作的风气，越来越盛行。
