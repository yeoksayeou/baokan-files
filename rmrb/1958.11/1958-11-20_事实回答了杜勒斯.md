Facts Answer Dulles
Zhou Kun, Li Xiao

On the afternoon of the 15th, a car drove to the gate of the Si Ji Qing People's Commune. The door opened, and an old woman with silver hair, spirited, and smiling stepped out. She was wearing a Chinese embroidered brocade cotton-padded jacket and holding a faded grass-green woolen handbag embroidered with six characters: "To Mrs. Strong," and below, "Presented by the Second Nursery of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region of the Chinese Liberated Area, August 15, 1946."

"Ah! This is our old friend, American progressive female writer Anna Louise Strong!" someone recognized her early. Before the translation comrade could introduce her one by one, everyone happily reached out to welcome her and said warmly, "Welcome Mrs. Strong to visit our commune." She also greeted everyone with great interest.

Old friends gathered together and chatted without restraint. Mrs. Strong asked us how the Si Ji Qing People's Commune was established, what the basic situation of the commune was, as well as the organizational structure and the increase in income of the members. Comrade Shen Duo, the deputy director of the commune, told her in detail that before the establishment of the commune, the members of the agricultural cooperatives wrote big-character posters and application letters every day, requesting the establishment of the people's commune. They beat gongs and drums to elect more than 300 commune member representatives, and everyone happily established the people's commune. At this time, a comrade took out nearly 150,000 poems created by the members for her to see and read two folk songs praising the commune and applying to join the people's commune. She happily copied these two poems in her notebook through the translator's interpretation. When she opened a collection of poems created by commune members, she immediately saw the poem and painting by commune member Han Shi "Portrait of Eisenhower and Dulles." She immediately asked the translator to read the poem on the painting to her. When she heard that it was a satire of Eisenhower and Dulles, she laughed and pointed to the two images of crows falling under the cross and asked, "Is this the paper tiger?!" The group of people sitting around her also laughed with contempt.

Then she took out a copy of an English telegram from her handbag and said: Dulles said in a speech to the Seattle Chamber of Commerce on the 13th that "the Chinese Communists are fanatically imposing a backward large-scale slavery system called 'communes' on the 650 million people of the mainland." After reading this passage, she raised her head and smiled and asked everyone, "What do you think about what he said, right?" Shen Duo and others laughed while holding their stomachs and said, "This is really infuriating and ridiculous. This is Dulles' slander against our commune. We are not living a life of slavery, but a life of freedom and happiness." He then introduced to Mrs. Strong the superiority and benefits of the people's commune. When Mrs. Strong heard that the commune members did not need money for meals, that the elderly who lacked support could enter the homes of happiness, and that children could enter nurseries, she smiled again with a spring breeze on her face. Then she picked up the telegram and read two sentences where Dulles slandered the Chinese people's commune members for "not only losing the little property that his master had not confiscated, but also losing his house and his family." "Respected ancestral graves are now being plowed everywhere." Shen Duo smiled and said to Mrs. Strong, "We are not like that at all. Not only have we not lost our property, but our income has also increased in our lives. Commune members all have their own happy families, and the houses are all their own. The commune is also preparing to build buildings for the members!" Shen Duo stood up and pointed to the ancestral graves of the commune members outside the window for Mrs. Strong to see: "Look, the ancestral graves of our commune members are all there! They have not been plowed. In some areas, even if construction is to be carried out on the graves, the state and the commune will first obtain the consent of the tomb owners, and issue them a large amount of relocation fees to assist in moving the graves to the public cemetery."

Mrs. Strong put away her telegram and asked the female commune member Jian Shuqin standing next to her with concern: "How old are you? Are you married? What do you do in the commune? Do you want to eat in the canteen?" Jian Shuqin said shyly, "I am twenty years old this year and just got married a month ago." Then she said, "I am a commune member and participate in labor in the commune. I have a small family. But I still want to eat in the canteen, because the canteen has a variety of dishes, I eat full and fragrant, and it saves time." Mrs. Strong also smiled for her happy life.

This talkative old woman, who is already seventy-one years old, although she had been talking to the commune members until dusk, still had no fatigue and braved the early winter cold to watch the "Communist Style Exhibition" held by the Si Ji Qing Commune one mile away. At the exhibition, she was interested in every exhibit and every chart, especially when she saw the part of the commune's three-year plan, she carefully copied those planned targets into her notebook. At the exhibition, she met a farmer who was nearly forty years old and enthusiastically struck up a conversation: "How is your life now?" The commune member smiled and said: "Of course it is better than before, and I don’t have to spend money on food, and my life is guaranteed. It’s not like I was oppressed and exploited by the landlord before liberation." After speaking, he happily lifted the child to sit on his shoulders and let Mrs. Strong see, as if to show that he did not "lose his family" as Dulles slandered.

After Mrs. Strong finished watching the exhibition, she wrote her feelings in the guestbook:

"As the first audience of your exhibition, I congratulate all the members of the commune. I will telegraph what I heard today to New York to answer Dulles' slander against China's establishment of people's communes.

Thank you very much for your hospitality!" (Attached picture)

    事实回答了杜勒斯
    周坤、李肖
    15日下午，一辆小轿车驶到四季青人民公社门前，车门一开，从里边走出一位鬓发银白、精神奕奕、面带微笑的老人。她身穿一件中国绣花锦缎棉袄，手拿着一个褪了色的草绿色呢料手提包，上边绣着六个字：“给斯特朗夫人”，下边绣着“中国解放区陕甘宁边区第二保育院敬赠，1946年8月15日”。
    “啊！这是咱们的老朋友，美国进步女作家安娜·路易斯·斯特朗夫人！”有人早认出来了。未等翻译同志一一介绍，大伙就高兴地伸手欢迎，亲热地说：“欢迎斯特朗夫人到我们社里来作客”，她也兴致勃勃地向大家问好。
    老朋友欢聚一堂，就毫无拘谨地畅谈起来了。斯特朗夫人向我们问起四季青人民公社是怎样成立起来的，社里的基本情况怎样，以及组织机构、社员收入增长的情形。社副主任申多同志详细地告诉她，在成立公社前夕，各农业社社员天天写要求成立人民公社的大字报、申请书，他们敲锣打鼓地选举出三百多名社员代表，大家兴高彩烈地办起了人民公社。这时一个同志拿出社员创作的近十五万首的诗稿给她看，并念了两首社员申请加入人民公社和歌颂公社好的民歌。她高兴地将这两首诗通过翻译的口译，抄写在本子上。当她翻开一本社员创作诗稿时，一眼就看到了社员韩石“给艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯画像”的诗和画，她马上请翻译将画上那首诗，念给她听。她一听是讽刺艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的，就哈哈大笑起来，指着乌鸦落在十字架下的两个像问：“这就是纸老虎？！”围坐在她身旁的一群人，也都藐视地笑起来了。
    接着她从手提包里拿出一份英文电稿说：杜勒斯13日在西雅图商会发表的讲演里说，“中国共产党人正在把一种称为‘公社’制度的落后的大规模奴役制度狂热地强加在六亿五千万大陆人民的身上。”念完了这段话，她抬起头笑着问大家：“他这样说，你们是怎样想的，对吗？”申多等人捂着肚子笑着说：“这真使人气愤，又使人感到可笑，这是杜勒斯对我们公社的污蔑，我们并不是过着奴役制的生活，而是过着自由幸福的生活。”他接着就向斯特朗夫人介绍人民公社的优越性和好处。当斯特朗夫人听到了公社成员吃饭不要钱，乏人供养的老人能进幸福院，儿童能进托儿所时，她又满面春风地笑起来了。接着又拿起电稿念了两句杜勒斯污蔑中国人民公社社员“不仅失去了他的主人还没有没收的那一点点财产，他还失去了他的住宅，失去了他的家庭。”“受人尊敬的祖坟，现在到处被耕掉。”申多笑着对斯特朗夫人说：“我们根本不是这样：我们不但没有失掉财产，生活上还增加了收入，社员个个都有自己的幸福家庭，房子都是自己的，社里还正准备为社员盖楼房呢！”申多站起来指着窗外社员的祖坟让斯特朗夫人看：“您看，我们社员的祖坟都在那摆着呢！并没有被耕掉。有的地区就是为了在坟地上进行建设，国家和公社也是事先征求得坟主的同意，并发给他大批迁坟费，协助把坟墓迁到人民公墓里去。”
    斯特朗夫人收起她的电稿，又关切地问站在她身边的女社员简淑琴：“你多大年岁啦？结婚了没有？你在社里作什么？愿意吃食堂不？”简淑琴羞涩地说：“我今年二十岁，刚结婚一个月。”接着她又说：“我是一个社员，在社里参加劳动，有个小家庭。但我还是愿意在食堂吃，因为食堂的饭菜花样多，吃的又饱又香，而且可以节省时间。”斯特朗夫人也为她的幸福生活笑开了颜。
    这位年已七十一岁的健谈的老人，虽已和社员谈到黄昏啦，但她还是毫无倦意地冒着初冬的寒冷，到一里外观看了四季青公社举办的“共产主义风格展览会”。在展览会上，她对每件展览品，每一张图表都感到兴趣，特别是当她看到社里三年规划那部分，她更认真地把那些计划指标抄写在本子上。在展览会上，她遇到一位年近四十岁的农民，就热情攀谈起来啦：“你现在的生活怎么样？”这位社员笑着说：“当然比过去好了，吃饭也不用花钱啦，生活上也有了保证。不像解放前再受地主压迫剥削啦。”说完，他就高兴地把孩子举到肩膀上坐着，让斯特朗夫人看，好像在表示他并没有像杜勒斯所污蔑的“失去了他的家庭”。
    斯特朗夫人看完了展览会以后，即在留言簿上写下了她的观感：
    “作为你们的展览会的第一个观众，我祝贺公社的所有社员们。我将把今天听到的事，用电报发到纽约去，来回答杜勒斯对中国建立人民公社的污蔑。
    非常谢谢你们招待！”（附图片）
