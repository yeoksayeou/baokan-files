Night of Grain Transport
By our reporters Zhou Duxhou and Huang Shengpu

The members of the Dongfanghong People's Commune in Hengnan County, Hunan Province, quickly ate their dinner in the canteen and then hurriedly prepared their vehicles, baskets, and lanterns and torches for lighting, ready to transport grain overnight. They had only received the grain delivery notice before dinner. He Yousheng, a member of the Jiangkou team, was worried about not being able to find tools because the transportation equipment of the Jiangkou team had been transferred to support steel production. Female commune member He Xie quickly searched house to house and found more than eighty water buckets. Just as people were happy to have weapons to participate in the transportation battle, Liu Chunyuan, a teacher from Jiangkou Elementary School, led more than one hundred and eighty students to support tonight's night battle. When the elementary school students saw that there were no tools, they immediately returned to the school to empty their schoolbags.

At more than seven o'clock in the evening, night had fallen, and the earth was dark. At this time, the advance troops had already lit blazing bonfires along the way, and bright gas lamps, horse lamps, and lanterns and torches were set up on the bridgeheads, narrow passes, and winding and turning dangerous roads. The lights formed a red line, like several long and winding fire dragons. The order to set off was issued, and the 12,000 transport fighters of the entire commune rushed forward like ten thousand horses galloping, all striving to be the first. Along the way, cars chased cars, people chased people, and they rushed quickly towards the grain gathering place—Xiaojiangkou. The soldiers of the Jiangkou team ran the fastest under the leadership of team leader Jiang Changda and became the vanguard of the entire corps. The women's team was not to be outdone, and they all carried more than one hundred catties. Wang Xiaoxing and others from the Guanshi motorcade pushed two large packages per vehicle. They took off their clothes and hurried on their way without falling behind. The "crashing" footsteps, the "rumbling" of the wheels, and the heroic competition sounds of "Faster!" "Hurry up and catch up!" that came from the team from time to time resounded throughout the dark wilderness. Despite the cold night in early winter and the howling north wind, the people delivering grain were sweating profusely and full of steam.

The three or four-mile-long mountain road from the Gongping Brigade to Xiaojiangkou is a famous dangerous road. On one side are high mountains and ridges, and on the other side is a very deep riverbed. Usually, people passing through here during the day risk falling into the river if they are not careful. But on this night, it became an indifferent shortcut in front of the grain delivery warriors. In addition to lighting bonfires along the way, several self-recommended Huang Zhong veterans guarded the various dangerous passes. Seventy-seven-year-old Xie Zhiqin, the captain did not allow him to participate in the night battle, so he took a torch to help the transportation team with lighting and also wanted to contribute to the grain delivery.

In order to ensure the safety of the grain delivery warriors and to ensure that the warriors had food and drink on the road, the commune's health personnel also organized three medical teams to tour and treat along the various routes that night. Tea stations were generally set up along the way, and several public canteens near the road specially prepared hot and fragrant sweet potatoes for the grain delivery warriors.

At more than ten o'clock in the evening, more than forty wooden sailboats transporting coal to support steel production docked one after another. Hearing that grain was to be transported to Chashanao to load trains, under the call of Secretary Luo of the Commune Party Committee, the land and water transportation armies began to unload coal and wash the ships together. In order to get the grain to the city and industrial and mining areas as soon as possible, the boatmen did not even bother to rest and hurried to take action. After an hour of hard work, the coal on more than forty ships was completely unloaded and cleaned, and then grain was loaded. One ship was loaded and one ship sailed. In this way, the river and the shore were busy. One ship followed another in the river, heading continuously towards Chashanao. (Attached picture)

    运粮之夜
    本报记者　周笃佑　黄生谱
    湖南省衡南县东方红人民公社的社员们在食堂里三拨两咽地吃罢晚饭，就各自赶忙准备车辆、箩筐和照明用的灯龙火把，准备连夜送粮。他们是吃晚饭之前才接到送粮通知的。江口队的运输工具原来都调去支援钢铁生产了，社员贺佑生正在为找不到工具着急。女社员贺谢氏就赶紧挨家寻找了八十多个担水桶。人们正在为自己有了参加运输战斗的武器高兴的时候，江口完小刘春元老师又带领了一百八十多个学生赶来支援今晚的夜战。小学生们看到没有工具，就立即回校把自己的书包腾出来。
    晚上七点多钟，夜幕已经降临，大地一片漆黑，这时各路先遣部队，早已在沿途生起了熊熊的火堆，桥头隘口和转弯拐角的险道上，都架上亮晶晶的汽灯、马灯和灯笼火把。灯火结成了一根红线，活像几条漫长弯曲的火龙。出发的命令下达了，全公社一万二千名运输战士有如万马奔腾，个个争先，一路上车追车、人赶人飞快地向着粮食集结地点——小江口前进。江口队的战士在队长江常达的率领下跑得最快，成了整个兵团的先锋。妇女队也不甘示弱，她们都挑一百多斤。冠市车队的社员王校兴等人，一车推了两大包，他们脱下衣服赶路也没有落后，“擦擦擦”的脚步声，“辘辘辘”的车轮声和队伍里不时发出的“快点”！“快点赶上去！”……充满英雄气概的竞赛声，响遍了漆黑的原野。尽管在这初冬的寒夜，北风吹得呼呼作响，但是送粮的人们却是一个个奔得满头冒汗，热气腾腾。
    从公平大队到小江口这段三、四里长的山路，是有名的险道，一边是高山峻岭，一边是很深的河床。往常，人们白天经过这里，一不小心，都有掉到河里的危险。但这一天晚上在送粮战士面前却成了无所谓的便道。原来他们除了沿途生上火堆以外，还有几个自告奋勇的黄忠老将把守了各个险关。七十七岁的谢志卿，队长不让他参加夜战，他便拿着火把帮运输队照明，也要为送粮出一份力量。
    为了保证送粮战士们的安全和使战士们在路上有吃有喝，这天夜里公社里的卫生人员还组织了三个医疗队，到各路巡回进行治疗。沿途普遍设立了茶水站，几个靠近路边的公共食堂还特地为送粮战士准备了热呼呼香喷喷的红薯供应。
    到了晚上十点多钟，运煤支援钢铁生产的四十多艘木帆船纷纷靠岸，听说要运粮到茶山坳去装火车，在公社党委罗书记的号召下，水陆两路运输大军就一齐动手卸煤洗船，为了使粮食能够快点运到城里、工矿区去，船民们也顾不上休息就赶忙行动起来。经过一小时的大干，四十多条船的煤炭全部卸光洗净，随即装粮，装满一船开一船，就这样水里岸上忙得热火朝天。河里一船跟一船，源源不断向茶山坳开去。（附图片）
