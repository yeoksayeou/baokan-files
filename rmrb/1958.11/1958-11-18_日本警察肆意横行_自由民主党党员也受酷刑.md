　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: According to Kyodo News Agency today, Tokujiro Muraki, former chairman of the Shibuya Ward Assembly in Tokyo, filed a complaint with the Tokyo Legal Affairs Bureau's Human Rights Protection Department, stating that he "suffered torture similar to that of the old army era" in the Metropolitan Police Department's interrogation room.

　　Muraki, a member of Nobusuke Kishi's Liberal Democratic Party, was arrested during the Shibuya Ward mayoral election in Tokyo last October due to a case involving ward assembly members accepting huge bribes from candidates.

　　Muraki was interrogated in the Metropolitan Police Department's interrogation room by a chief inspector and seven others for 22 days. According to Muraki, Inspector Aoki and two others subjected him to physical torture. They used methods commonly employed by the old navy to leave him half-dead, rubbing his head violently with their fists 46 times, and shouting abusive words such as "dog, cat, maggot" next to Muraki's ears.

　　As the Japanese people are rising up to condemn the Nobusuke Kishi government's "Police Officer Duty Execution Law Amendment" for infringing upon basic human rights, this complaint has caused considerable alarm within the Nobusuke Kishi government authorities. The Tokyo Legal Affairs Bureau's Human Rights Protection Department has decided to launch an investigation into the complaint filed by Muraki.

    日本警察肆意横行
    自由民主党党员也受酷刑
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：据共同社今天报道，曾任东京都涩谷区议会议长村木德次郎向东京法务局人权拥护部提出控诉说，他在警视厅的审讯室“受到了旧军队时代那样的肉刑拷问”。
    村木是岸信介的自由民主党党员，在去年10月东京都涩谷区举行区长选举的时候，他因为区议会议员们接受候选人巨额贿赂的案件被捕。
    村木在警视厅的审讯室受到主任警部等七人历时二十二天的审讯。据村木说，青木警部等三人曾经对他施加肉刑拷问，被他们用旧海军所常用的办法弄得半死不活，他们用拳头死力磨擦他的脑袋四十六次，还在村木的耳朵旁边大声叫嚷“狗、猫、蛆虫”等咒骂人的话。
    正在日本人民群起谴责岸信介政府的“警察官职务执行法修正案”侵犯基本人权的时候，这一控诉使得岸信介政府当局颇为惊慌。东京法务局人权拥护部已经决定着手调查村木所提出的控诉。
