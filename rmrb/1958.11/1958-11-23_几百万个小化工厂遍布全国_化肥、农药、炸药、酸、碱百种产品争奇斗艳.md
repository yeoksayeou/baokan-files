Chemical industry, since the implementation of the policy of starting with small-scale indigenous methods, and vigorously promoting "small indigenous groups," has seen the construction of millions of small-scale indigenous chemical factories (sites) across the country, producing over a hundred types of products, powerfully supporting industrial and agricultural production.

The vast rural areas have universally established fertilizer plants and pesticide factories. Hunan Province alone has built more than 250,000 fertilizer plants (sites) this year, already producing over 670,000 tons of fertilizer. They are striving to produce 1.7 million tons of fertilizer by the end of the year to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture next year. This year, agricultural science departments have promoted more than 50 types of simple production experiences among the masses, such as bacterial fertilizer, superphosphate, antibiotic fertilizer, granular fertilizer, and fused phosphate fertilizer. In terms of pesticides, various regions have produced hundreds of types of pesticides using indigenous methods, including water-based and powder-based pesticides. Among them, *baibu* root and saltpeter solution, tobacco-soap-BHC mixture, Five-Combination Amazing Liquid, *xun teng* root liquid, *baibu* root liquor mixture, lime-sulfur mixture, and other pesticides have insecticidal efficiencies of over 90%, and are welcomed by the vast number of farmers. In the manufacturing of pesticides, farmers promoted traditional Chinese medicine practitioners as engineers, climbing mountains to find wild medicinal herbs. In many areas of Hunan Province, the masses and "engineers" combined to find more than 100 types of poisonous weeds, producing hundreds of types of pesticides tailored to local conditions. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 100,000 indigenous pesticide factories in this province, already producing more than 120,000 tons of pesticides.

The whole people are engaged in large-scale iron and steel production, urgently requiring acids, alkalis, and explosives. Various regions have then built more than 1,300 sulfuric acid plants and 350 indigenous alkali plants. The equipment of these plants is very simple, using a large amount of non-metallic materials, easy to operate, low in cost, and using local materials, local production, and local use, reducing a large amount of transportation costs. The enthusiasm of the masses in various regions for running indigenous explosives is also very high. Sichuan Province alone has established more than 200 indigenous explosives factories. In Henan Province, one million people participated in scraping earth for saltpeter and making explosives, forming a surge of "every household contributing earth saltpeter, every township and commune making explosives."

Various regions are also trying to use agricultural products to make rubber. Small-scale indigenous artificial rubber factories in Beijing, Lanzhou, Changshou, and other places have recently been put into production, opening up broad avenues for China's comprehensive utilization of abundant agricultural products.

Many street residents, government agencies, schools, and even small shops have started chemical industries. Residents of streets in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, raised their own equipment and raw materials, and started 37 chemical factories. Some clothing stores in Heilongjiang Province produce rayon, leather stores produce caustic soda, and tofu shops engage in peat dry distillation, making full use of various resources.

In order to further develop the small indigenous groups movement in the chemical industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has sent a large number of work teams to various parts of the country to assist in studying the full utilization of local resources and determining production varieties.

    几百万个小化工厂遍布全国
    化肥、农药、炸药、酸、碱百种产品争奇斗艳
    本报讯　化学工业自从实行小型土法先上马，大搞“小土群”的方针以来，全国已建设起小型土法化工厂（场）数百万个，生产着一百多种产品，有力的支援了工农业生产。
    广大农村普遍建立了化肥厂、农药厂。湖南省今年建成的化肥厂（场）就有二十五万多个，已生产化肥六十七万多吨。他们正在争取到年底生产化肥一百七十万吨，以保证明年农业大丰收。今年，农业科学部门共向群众推广了简易生产细菌肥、过磷酸钙、抗生菌肥、颗粒肥、熔融磷肥等五十多种经验。在农药方面，各地用土法生产的水剂、粉剂两类农药达数百种，其中百部皮硝液、烟叶肥皂六六六合剂、五合惊天液、熏藤根液剂、百部烧酒合剂、石灰硫磺合剂等农药，杀虫效率都在90％以上，受到广大农民的欢迎。在制造农药中，农民推中医为工程师，登山找野生药草。湖南省许多地区群众和“工程师”结合，找到毒草一百多种，因地制宜，生产出数百种农药。据不完全统计，这个省有土农药厂十万多个，已生产农药十二万多吨。
    全民大办钢铁，迫切需要酸、碱、炸药，各地便照办了一千三百多个硫酸厂，三百五十个土碱厂。这些厂的设备都很简单，大量使用非金属材料，操作容易，造价很低，而且就地取材、就地生产、就地使用，减少了大量的运输费用。各地群众办土炸药的劲头也很高。只四川省就建立了土炸药厂二百多个。河南省有一百万人参加刮土硝、制炸药，形成“家家户户献土硝、乡乡社社制炸药”的热潮。
    各地还试用农产品做橡胶，北京、兰州、长寿等地的小型土法人造橡胶厂最近都已投入生产，给我国综合利用丰富的农产品打开了广阔的道路。
    许多街道居民、机关学校，甚至小商店都办了化学工业。浙江省宁波市的街道居民自筹设备和原料，办起了三十七个化工厂。黑龙江省有些缝衣店生产人造棉、皮革店生产苛化烧碱、豆腐房搞草炭干馏，充分利用了各种资源。
    为了进一步开展化学工业的小土群运动，化学工业部已派出大批工作组到全国各地，协助研究充分利用当地资源，确定生产品种。（附图片）
