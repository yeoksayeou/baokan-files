Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 13th. Indonesian Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Nasution, recently delivered a speech saying that the Indonesian National Armed Forces oppose the establishment of a military committee to control state power. They do not want to seize state power like the military in some countries have recently done, nor do they want to make the armed forces political sappers like in some South American countries.

Nasution said that the Indonesian National Armed Forces will continue to maintain their current position, namely to participate in the country's top decision-making by holding important government positions.

Nasution made these remarks on the 11th while speaking to students at the National Military Academy in Magelang, Central Java, on the occasion of the academy's first anniversary. He said that some people predict that the events of seizing power that have recently occurred in some countries will also occur in Indonesia. He said, "However, as in the past, we Indonesians have now found a working method that can solve all problems, and this working method can be called the 'middle way'." Nasution pointed out that this method was decided by the Supreme Commander of the Indonesian Armed Forces, the government, and the army leadership, that is, to provide extensive opportunities for military leaders to participate in the work of deciding the country's highest policies (such as financial and economic policies) in their individual capacities outside the military field.

He said that there are already, or will be, military leaders participating in government organizations, such as the Cabinet, the National Council, and the National Planning Commission to be established. In addition, mainly due to the efforts of the Head of State, the parliament will also provide seats for military leaders in the future after the parliamentary organization is changed.

    印度尼西亚陆军参谋长说
    陆军不想夺取国家政权
    但要担任政府重要职务参加最高决策工作
    新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安中将最近发表演说说，印度尼西亚国家部队反对建立军事委员会来控制国家政权，他们不想像一些国家的军人最近所作的那样夺取国家政权，他们也不想像某些南美国家那样使武装部队成为政治的工兵。
    纳苏蒂安说，印度尼西亚国家部队将继续保持目前的立场，即通过担任政府的重要职务来参加国家的最高决策工作。
    纳苏蒂安是11日在中爪哇马吉冷的全国军事学院建校一周年向学生发表演说时说这番话的。他说，有些人预言，最近在某些国家内发生的夺取政权的事件也将在印度尼西亚发生。他说，“但是，像过去一样，我们印度尼西亚人目前已经找到能够解决一切问题的工作方法，这种工作方法可以叫做‘中间道路。’”纳苏蒂安指出，这种方法是印度尼西亚三军最高统帅、政府和陆军领导机构所决定的，那就是对军事领袖们提供广泛的机会，让他们以个人身份在军事领域以外参加决定国家最高政策（例如财政、经济政策）的工作。
    他说，目前已经有或者将要有军事领袖参加政府组织，例如内阁、民族委员会以及将要成立的国家计划委员会。此外，主要由于国家元首的努力，在将来国会组织改变以后，国会也将给军事领袖提供席位。
