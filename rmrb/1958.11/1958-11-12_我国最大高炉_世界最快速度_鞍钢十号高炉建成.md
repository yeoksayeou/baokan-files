Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 11th: Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 10 Blast Furnace, currently China's largest, was completed today and began heating up.

This automated blast furnace took only four months and twenty-six days from the first shovel of earth to its official completion. This astonishing construction speed is unprecedented in the history of blast furnace construction worldwide.

When the construction plan for No. 10 Blast Furnace was decided in May, the Party organization put forward a bold plan: to produce iron by January 1, 1959. At that time, some people believed that the fastest speed for building large blast furnaces in the world was generally eight months, and it would be impossible to break this record. However, in the process of construction, the broad masses of workers boldly broke with outdated rules and regulations, and broke through the boundaries of upper and lower process handover, so that eight construction units and dozens of types of work, including earthwork, metal structure, furnace construction, mechanical installation, and electrical installation, could work simultaneously. While the upper part of the blast furnace was still being installed with the furnace shell, the furnace construction workers had already built protective sheds and were laying bricks underneath. According to convention, mechanical installation should only begin after the metal structure is installed, but the workers assembled and prepared on the one hand, and helped with the installation of scattered components of the metal structure on the other hand, which greatly shortened the construction period. For example, the installation of the hoist, an important piece of equipment for the blast furnace, took only five days, while it took more than a month during the construction of No. 9 Blast Furnace.

Vigorously carrying out technical revolution and adopting new construction methods in every process is one of the important factors for the early completion of this blast furnace. In the pouring of the blast furnace's main foundation, concrete workers used belt conveyors to pour 3,200 cubic meters of concrete in 22 hours, setting a national record (Note: Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace foundation concrete was 1,790 cubic meters, poured in 27 hours; Baotou Iron and Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace foundation concrete was 1,740 cubic meters, poured in 22 and a half hours); the metal structure installation team used large-scale installation and component assembly flow operation methods, and completed the installation of the massive blast furnace shell in only 27 days. The furnace construction workers created the "three-person connected trapezoidal bricklaying method," overcoming the difficulty of insufficient technical strength. The bricklaying of the blast furnace body was completed in sixteen and a half days. (Attached picture)

### 我国最大高炉  世界最快速度  鞍钢十号高炉建成

    我国最大高炉  世界最快速度
    鞍钢十号高炉建成
    据新华社鞍山11日电　我国目前最大的高炉——鞍钢十号高炉，已在今天建成并开始烘炉。
    这座自动化高炉，从开始挖第一铲土到正式建成，总共只用了四个月另二十六天，这种惊人的施工速度，在世界高炉建筑史上也是空前的。
    当5月份十号高炉决定建设方案时，党组织就提出了一个大胆的计划：要在1959年1月1日出铁。当时，有些人认为目前世界上建造大型高炉最快的速度一般是八个月，要打破这个纪录是不可能的。但是，广大职工在施工过程中，大胆打破了陈规旧律，冲破了上下工序交接的界线，使土方、金属结构、筑炉、机械安装和电气安装等八个施工单位、几十种工种同时施工。高炉上部还在安装炉皮，筑炉工人就已经搭上保护棚在下面砌砖。按照常规，机械安装要在金属结构安完以后才开始，但是，工人们一面进行组装准备，一面帮助金属结构安装零星构件，这就大大缩短了施工期限。如高炉的重要设备卷扬机的安装，只用了五天时间，而在九号高炉建设时却花了一个多月。
    大闹技术革命、在每个过程中采用新的施工方法，是这座高炉提前建成的重要因素之一。在高炉主体基础的浇灌中，混凝土工人采用皮带运输机浇灌，二十二小时浇灌了三千二百立方公尺混凝土，创造了全国最高纪录（按：武钢一号高炉基础混凝土一千七百九十立方公尺，二十七小时浇完；包钢一号高炉基础混凝土一千七百四十立方公尺，二十二个半小时浇完）；金属结构安装队职工采用大块安装和构件拼装流水作业的方法，仅用二十七天时间就安装完了庞大的高炉外壳。筑炉工人创造了“三人连接梯形砌砖法”，克服了技术力量不足的困难。十六天半就完成了高炉炉体砌砖工程。（附图片）
