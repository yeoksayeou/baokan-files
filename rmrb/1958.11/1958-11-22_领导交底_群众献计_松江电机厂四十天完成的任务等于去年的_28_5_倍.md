    Leaders Explain, Masses Contribute
    Songjiang Electric Motor Factory Completes a Task 28.5 Times Greater Than Last Year's in Forty Days

    (Our report) The Songjiang Electric Motor Factory in Harbin employed the methods of "Three Explanations" (explaining the task to the workers, explaining its significance, and explaining the methods), "Four Greats" (great airing of views, great blooming of ideas, great debates, and big-character posters) to vigorously launch a mass movement. Recently, in forty days, it successfully completed a newly added production task of 1,700 100kW electric motors to support blast furnaces across the country.

    After receiving this batch of electric motor tasks to support blast furnaces nationwide, this factory broke the conventional rules of enterprise management in the past and changed the issuance of plans to "Three Explanations," that is, explaining the task and also explaining its significance and methods. It told the workers in detail the amount of task the factory was responsible for this time, explaining the great significance of completing this task one day earlier, which would mean producing more than one million tons of steel for the country, and explained the difficulties and key points to the masses clearly. Then, it mobilized the entire factory's workers to engage in great airing of views, great blooming of ideas, great debates, and big-character posters to discuss the measures and methods for completing this task.

    According to the calculations of the technical personnel, if they relied on only a few people and only on top-down plan issuance as in the past, to produce this large batch of electric motors, the factory would have to add 1,300 machine tools and 2,000 workers. Now, the factory leaders told everyone in the factory that to make these more than 1,700 electric motors, they would not spend money to buy equipment from the outside, nor would they increase personnel. They asked everyone to engage in great airing of views, great blooming of ideas, great debates, and big-character posters to see what methods could be used to tap the potential and complete the task of supporting national steel production. Suddenly, the masses of the entire factory were vigorously mobilized. Because the workers clearly recognized this arduous and glorious task, they immediately set off a high tide of great airing of views and offering suggestions. In the production process, the workers also achieved the goal of debating, thinking of solutions, and producing simultaneously whenever there were problems. When the sand casting workshop's motor casing group was given the plan to produce 60 to 80 motor casings per day, the daily output was only over 20. Someone then said: "The motor casings are large, the tasks are many, the time is tight, and there is a lack of tools and technicians. If we can reach 60, take my head off." Most of the workers debated with him and actively improved labor organization, created sand mold drying kilns, soil sand sifting machines, and reformed the shelves of core kilns and other equipment, eventually achieving a daily output of 90.

    Originally, the state required the factory to complete this batch of electric motor tasks with a total capacity of 170,000 kilowatts within 60 days. As a result, not only did they not add a single worker or buy a single machine from the outside, but they also completed the task 20 days ahead of schedule. This heavy electric motor production task is equivalent to twice the total capacity of electric motors produced by the factory from January to August this year, and equivalent to 28 and a half times the total capacity of electric motors actually completed by the factory last year.

### 领导交底　群众献计  松江电机厂四十天完成的任务等于去年的28.5倍

    领导交底　群众献计
    松江电机厂四十天完成的任务等于去年的28.5倍
    本报讯　哈尔滨市松江电机厂运用了“三交”（向职工交任务交意义交方法）“四大”（大鸣大放大辩论大字报）大搞群众运动的作法，最近在四十天内胜利地完成了一批新追加的支援全国各地高炉用的一千七百台一百瓩电机的生产任务。
    这个厂接收这批支援全国的高炉电机任务后，打破过去企业管理的常规，变下达计划为“三交”，即交任务也交意义和方法。详细告诉职工这次工厂负担的任务量，说明早一天完成这项任务就可多为国家生产一百多万吨钢的重要意义，并将困难和关键向群众交代得清清楚楚。然后发动全厂职工大鸣大放大辩论贴大字报来讨论完成这项任务的措施和方法。
    根据技术人员计算，如果像过去那样只靠少数人只靠从上而下下达计划，要生产这一大批电机，这个厂就要增加一千三百台机床和二千个工人。现在，工厂领导告诉全厂的人，要做这一千七百多台电机，一不花钱向外面买设备，二不增加人，大家来大鸣大放大辩论出大字报，看用什么办法把潜力挖出来，完成这个支援全国钢铁生产的任务。一下子全厂的群众就轰轰烈烈的发动起来了。由于职工明确认识到这个艰巨、光荣的任务，立刻掀起大鸣大放、献计献策的热潮。工人们在生产过程中，还做到了有问题就边辩论，边想办法，边生产。翻砂工区机壳小组在下达日产六十至八十台机壳计划时，日产仅二十多台。有人就说：“机壳大、任务多、时间紧，又缺工具和技工，如能达到六十台，把我脑袋拿下来。”大多数工人就和他辩论，并且积极改进劳动组织，创造了砂型干燥窑，土筛砂机，改革了芯子窑的架子等设备，最后使日产量达到九十台。
    原来国家要求工厂在六十天内完成的这批总容量十七万瓩的电机任务，结果不但没有增添一个工人，没有从外面购买一台机器，而且还提前二十天完成了任务。这批繁重的电机生产任务相当于这个厂今年1到8月份生产电机总容量的两倍，相当于这个厂去年实际完成的电机总容量的二十八倍半。
