Xinhua News Agency, November 21st: Our correspondent reports: Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement on the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" exposed the Kishi Nobusuke government's willingness to allow Japan to act as a tool for the United States to carry out aggression in Asia, in order to realize its conspiracy to continue to be hostile to China and expand into Southeast Asia. This made the Kishi Nobusuke government very panicked. It hurriedly came out to whitewash itself and slandered China for "interfering in Japan's internal affairs."

Kondo Shinichi, Director of the Public Information and Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kishi Nobusuke government, said in a statement on the 20th: "Japan's cooperation with the United States is not for the purpose of war provocation or adopting an imperialist policy." However, he only said this and could not provide any factual basis. In order to cover up Kishi Nobusuke's latent imperialist ambitions, Kondo even put powder on the face of the United States, a globally recognized planner of wars of aggression, and described the United States as "sincerely hoping to establish world peace."

Kondo Shinichi's attempt to cover up the facts with exaggerated lies is futile. The draft military treaties drawn up by Japan and the United States that have already been revealed fully expose their imperialist and aggressive nature. Both drafts reaffirm Japan's status as a base for American aggressive wars, and the draft proposed by the United States more clearly stipulates that the treaty's applicable area should be expanded to the Western Pacific.

Kondo's remarks show that the Kishi Nobusuke government is particularly afraid that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement will expose the United States' attempt to exploit the Japanese people's desire for independence and autonomy, and conspire to use the trick of substituting beams and pillars to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" into an even more unequal treaty for Japan. In his remarks, Kondo self-deceptively said that the current negotiations between Japan and the United States to revise the "Security Treaty" are "based on the strong desire of the Japanese people to adjust this treaty on an equal footing."

Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement sounded the alarm for the Kishi Nobusuke government's ambition to repeat the old path of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China and Southeast Asian countries. In embarrassment, the Kishi Nobusuke government vainly attempted to stir up national sentiment among the Japanese people, and stubbornly slandered China's expression of hope that Japan would become a peaceful and neutral country as China "interfering in Japan's internal affairs." Kondo Shinichi said: "What path the Japanese people choose should be decided by the Japanese people themselves, and no other country has any reason to interfere in this issue." Kondo's statement is obviously not worth refuting. What path the Japanese people want to take should of course be chosen by the Japanese people. The Socialist Party has already put forward the proposition of making Japan a peaceful and neutral country. It should be said that the Socialist Party's demands are precisely the universal demands of the Japanese people. The surging struggles of the Japanese people against the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment," which aims to restore police rule, and demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," show that the path chosen by the Japanese people is one of peace, democracy, and independence, not the dead end of following the United States and reviving militarism that Kishi Nobusuke is taking.

The aggressive conspiracy of Japan and the United States to revise the "Security Treaty" not only violates the wishes of the Japanese people and harms Japan's peace, security, and sovereignty, but also threatens China's security and peace in Asia. It is entirely reasonable for relevant countries to express concern about Japan's future. The Kishi Nobusuke government's method of counter-slandering China will not help it escape the angry condemnation of the Japanese people and the Asian people for the aggressive conspiracy of Japan and the United States to revise the "Security Treaty."

    追随美国走侵略道路的野心被揭露无遗
    岸政府慌张不堪竭力进行掩饰
    竟诬蔑陈毅外长声明是干涉日本内政
    新华社21日讯　本社记者报道：中国外交部长陈毅关于日美修改“安全条约”的声明，揭穿了岸信介政府甘心使日本充当美国在亚洲进行侵略的工具、以便实现它继续敌视中国和向东南亚扩张的阴谋。这使岸信介政府非常慌张，它赶忙出来替自己粉饰，并且诬蔑中国“干涉日本内政”。
    岸信介政府外务省情报文化局局长近藤晋一在20日发表谈话说：“日本同美国合作，并不是为了进行战争挑衅或者采取帝国主义的政策。”但是，他只是这样说，拿不出事实根据来。为了替岸信介的潜在帝国主义野心打掩护，近藤甚至给世界人民公认的侵略战争策划者——美国搽粉，把美国也说成是什么“热诚希望建立世界和平”。
    近藤晋一这种用虚夸的谎言来掩盖事实的企图是徒劳的。已经透露出来的日美双方拟订的军事条约的草案，充分暴露了它们的帝国主义的侵略性质。这两个草案都再次肯定日本作为美国侵略战争基地的地位，美方提出的草案更加明白地规定要把条约适用地区扩大到西太平洋。
    近藤的谈话表现出，岸信介政府特别害怕陈毅外长的声明揭露了美国企图利用日本人民要求独立自主的愿望，阴谋用偷梁换柱的手法把日美“安全条约”修改成对日本更不平等的条约。近藤在他的谈话中自欺欺人地说，当前日美修改“安全条约”的谈判“是以日本人民希望在平等地位上调整这个条约的强烈愿望为基础的。”
    陈毅外长的声明，对岸信介政府企图再走侵略中国和侵略东南亚各国的日本帝国主义的老路的野心敲打了警钟。岸信介政府在窘困之余，妄图在日本人民中煽动民族情绪，硬把中国表示希望日本成为一个和平中立的国家，诬蔑为中国“干涉日本内政”。近藤晋一说：“日本国民要选择什么道路，这应该由日本国民自己来决定，其他任何国家都没有理由对这个问题指手划脚。”近藤的这种说法显然是不值一驳的。日本国民要走什么道路当然要由日本国民选择，社会党已经提出了要使日本成为和平中立的国家的主张，应该说，社会党的要求正是日本人民普遍的要求。日本人民反对目的在于恢复警察统治的“警察官职务执行法修正案”和要求废除日美“安全条约”的风起云涌的斗争，说明日本人民所选择的是和平、民主、独立的道路，而不是岸信介所走的追随美国、复活军国主义的死路。
    日美修改“安全条约”的侵略阴谋不仅违反了日本人民的愿望，损害了日本的和平安全和主权，同时也威胁着中国的安全和亚洲的和平。有关国家对日本的前途表示关怀是完全理所当然的。岸信介政府反诬中国的手法丝毫也不会帮助它摆脱日本人民和亚洲人民对于日美修改“安全条约”的侵略阴谋的愤怒谴责。
