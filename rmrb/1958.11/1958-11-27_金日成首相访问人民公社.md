    Premier Kim Il-sung Visits People's Commune
    By Our Correspondents Fang Di and Sun Yuchang
    The members of the Hongqi (Red Flag) People's Commune in Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, will forever cherish this happy day of November 26th. On this day, Premier Kim Il-sung and the distinguished guests of the Korean government delegation, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and others, made a special trip from Wuhan to visit the commune and engaged in extensive contact with the commune members.
    The members of the Hongqi People's Commune were exceptionally excited on this day to welcome the distinguished guests from the fraternal country. In order to welcome the distinguished guests, the commune members, disregarding their fatigue, worked through the night to rush-repair the roads so that cars could pass smoothly. In addition, the commune members also erected many banners and beautiful arches with slogans welcoming the distinguished guests on both sides of the roads and in the squares, decorating the commune as if for a festival.
    Premier Kim Il-sung and others arrived at the Qunyue Brigade of the commune near noon and began their visit there. In the reception room set up in the brigade headquarters building, Premier Kim Il-sung and others first viewed the model of the new residential village being built by the brigade. The model showed that in addition to residential houses, the new village would also have facilities such as a cultural palace, cinema, swimming pool, green areas, and roads. It was clearly a completely different picture compared to the old residential area. The Premier was very interested in the model; he listened and looked, and frequently inquired about the area occupied by the new village, the residential population, and the construction cost. Hu Yinlin, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, answered these questions in detail one by one. At this time, Zhang Tixue, the governor of Hubei Province, suggested that everyone sit down, and a cordial discussion began.
    The Premier listened carefully to Hu Yinlin's introduction of the commune's basic situation, the proportion of industrial and agricultural production, the distribution system, the allocation of labor, etc., and asked some relevant specific questions with great interest. He was not only concerned about the enormous changes in production after the establishment of the commune, but even more concerned about the living conditions of the members. He asked the commune, "Are you raising pigs?" Hu Yinlin replied that they were raising 20,000 pigs and 140,000 chickens, and that they had recently released 1.65 million fish fry into dedicated ponds. The Premier calculated and said with satisfaction, "Then there is an average of one pig for every two and a half people. You are doing a good job!" When the Premier heard that the commune had established various social welfare facilities and that all the young children were in nurseries or kindergartens, he asked whether the commune had established schools. Hu Yinlin told the Premier: "Eleven primary schools have been established, and all school-age children are enrolled. But there are too few middle schools, only four in total, with only over 900 students enrolled." Premier Zhou, who was present, smiled and said: "You have a big tone. The commune has only been established for more than three months, and this is already remarkable!" Premier Kim Il-sung, Vice Premier He Long, and others all laughed. While the guests and hosts were talking indoors, more and more commune members gathered in the outdoor square. The distinguished guests went outside and met with 2,500 commune members in the square. Premier Kim Il-sung also spoke to everyone.
    Then, amid warm applause from the masses, the Premier, together with Premier Zhou, walked towards the residential new village under construction. At a construction site directly opposite the reception room, they carefully observed and inquired about the construction and design of the houses. They learned that the cost of these houses was not high, only 1.5 yuan per square meter. Hu Yinlin said: "We are building according to the principle of adapting to local conditions and keeping things simple. Therefore, most of the materials we need can be solved by ourselves, so it doesn't cost much." Premier Kim Il-sung said with a smile: "That's very good!"
    After leaving the construction site, Premier Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou Enlai walked together towards a new house in front. Hu Yinlin introduced: "This was built just a few days ago, and three young couples held their weddings there the day before yesterday." The Premier listened and said with a happy smile: "Then let's go and take a look!" When everyone walked to the side of the new house, Vice Premier He Long, who had led farmers here in revolutionary wars 30 years ago and was very familiar with the area, looked at the tall house and said to the Premier: "The landlords' houses weren't even this good in the past!" He then jokingly said to Hu Yinlin: "Your current life is even better than the landlords," and the Premier laughed heartily again, saying, "This house is indeed good."
    Premier Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou also took a car to visit the Qixing Brigade. There, the distinguished guests first visited a high-yield wheat field. The seedlings in this field were already five inches tall, green and lovely to look at. Premier Kim Il-sung, Vice Chairman Park Jeong-ae, and Vice Premier He Long first walked into the wheat field, followed by Premier Zhou and other distinguished guests. On the wooden sign at the edge of the field was written: the high-yield target for this wheat field is 15,000 to 20,000 catties per mu.
    "Growing well!" Premier Kim Il-sung said.
    Leaving the high-yield field, the distinguished guests continued their visit. At this time, the roadside was full of crowds welcoming them. The militia, wearing "field force" symbols and carrying farm tools, were all energetic. At this time, Governor Zhang Tixue said to the Premier: "Look! They are the field force." The Premier smiled and walked over to shake hands with them.
    On the way to the commune's health clinic, the Premier saw a tractor by the side of the road and asked Hu Yinlin: How many tractors do you have now? Hu Yinlin replied that they had eleven and planned to buy twenty more next year. The Premier was very happy to hear this.
    In the health clinic, the Premier carefully viewed the wards and medicines. There was a female doctor here named Li Jingmin who had participated in the medical team to Korea. When the Premier heard this, he warmly shook hands with her. Vice Chairman Park Jeong-ae personally pinned a "China-Korea Friendship Medal" on her chest. Later, the Premier also had a cordial conversation with an old Chinese medicine practitioner who had been practicing medicine for 50 years.
    Premier Kim Il-sung and Vice Chairman Park Jeong-ae were particularly interested in visiting the Qixing Brigade's home for the elderly. This home for the elderly housed more than 20 elderly people, the oldest of whom was already 80 years old. Each of them had a room and a set of furniture, including a wardrobe, washbasin, towel, bed, mirror, etc. The room was cleaned very cleanly, which gave people a comfortable feeling. The Premier cordially talked with Yan Shoutian, 79, and other elderly people. The Premier said: "You live in a good era, you should live a few more years, I wish you all longevity!" In another room, Vice Chairman Park Jeong-ae talked with Chen, a 75-year-old woman, for a long time, inquiring about her past life.
    When visiting the kindergarten, the Premier lovingly caressed the innocent and lively children and asked the caregiver Zhou Guizhi about the children's life in the kindergarten. Before leaving, the Premier gave a flower given to him by a child to another child. Other distinguished guests also gave the flowers that the commune members had offered to the children and caregivers. The children shook hands with the distinguished guests in a naive manner, saying "Goodbye, Uncle" and "Goodbye, Auntie."
    Premier Kim Il-sung and the distinguished guests visited the commune for about four hours. After the visit, they also ate with the commune members in the commune's canteen. The commune members used what they considered the best dishes and meals to entertain the Premier and the distinguished guests. While eating, the Premier sat with Huang Caifu, who had been a volunteer soldier and participated in the five battles in Korea and the Battle of Shangganling. They talked like relatives, sometimes in Korean and sometimes in Chinese. Just before parting, the Premier gave Huang Caifu a "China-Korea Friendship Medal" and encouraged him, saying: "You performed very well in the war in the past. I wish you greater achievements in your work in the future." Huang Caifu said: "I will definitely do so."
    The distinguished guests left the commune at 3:30 in the afternoon. At this time, all the men, women, old and young of the commune reluctantly came to bid farewell to the Premier. When the motorcade had gone far away, people still looked at the distant place where the motorcade disappeared for a long time.

    金日成首相访问人民公社
    本报记者　方堤　孙玉昌
    湖北省应城县红旗人民公社的社员们将永远珍视11月26日这个幸福的日子。这天，金日成首相和朝鲜政府代表团的贵宾们，由周恩来总理和贺龙副总理等陪同，专程从武汉市前来公社参观和访问，并且和社员群众进行了广泛的接触。
    红旗人民公社的社员们这天异常兴奋地欢迎来自兄弟之邦的贵宾们。为了迎接贵宾们，社员们不顾疲劳连夜突击抢修了道路，以便汽车能够顺利地通行。此外，社员们还在道路的两旁和广场上树立了许多欢迎贵宾的标语牌和美丽的牌楼，把公社装饰得如临节日。
    金日成首相等在快到中午的时候到达这个公社的群跃大队，并在这里开始了访问。在设在大队部楼上的接待室里，金日成首相等首先参观了这个大队正在建设中的居民新村的模型。这个模型显示出：这个新村除有居民住宅外，还有文化宫、电影院、游泳池、绿化区、公路等设施，它和旧的居住区比起来显然是两个完全不同的画面。首相对这个模型很感兴趣，他一面听、一面看，还不时询问这个新村的占地面积、居住人口和造价等。公社党委书记胡银林对这些问题详细地一一作了答复。这时，湖北省省长张体学提议大家坐下来，于是一个亲切的座谈会开始了。
    首相细心地听取了胡银林关于公社的基本情况、工农业生产比例、分配制度、劳动力分配等情况的介绍，一边很有兴趣地询问了一些有关的具体问题，他不仅关心公社建立后生产情况的巨大变化，更关心社员的生活情况，他问公社“养猪了没有？”胡银林回答说养了两万头猪、十四万只鸡，不久前在专用的池子里放了一百六十五万尾鱼苗。首相算了算满意地说：“那么平均每两个半人就有一头猪了，你们搞得不错啊！”首相听到公社举办了各种社会福利设施，全部幼儿都进了托儿所或幼儿园后，就问起公社办学校了没有？胡银林告诉首相说：小学办了十一所，全部适龄儿童入了学，就是中学办少了，一共有四所，入校的学生才九百多人。”在座的周总理笑了笑说：“你们的口气真大，公社才办起来三个多月，这就了不起呀！”金日成首相和贺龙副总理等都笑了起来。当宾主在室内谈话的时候，室外广场上的社员群众愈聚愈多，贵宾们便走出室外，到广场上和二千五百名社员群众见了面，金日成首相并且对大家讲了话。
    接着，首相在群众的热烈掌声中，和周总理一起走向建设中的居民新村。在正对着接待室的一片工地上，他们仔细地观察和询问了住宅的建筑和设计情况。了解到这些住宅的造价并不高，每平方公尺只一元五角钱。胡银林说：“我们是按因陋就简的原则来建筑的，因此，要用的材料，除了很少一部分外，一般都能自己解决，所以花钱不多。”金日成首相笑着说：“这就很好嘛！”
    从这个工地出来，金日成首相和周恩来总理一起向前面一所新房屋走去，胡银林介绍说：“这是几天前才建成的，前一天还有三对青年在那里举行了婚礼。”首相听了高兴地笑着说：
  “那我们去看看！”大家走到新房旁边的时候，三十年前曾经领导农民在这里进行过革命战争、对这一带的情况很熟悉的贺龙副总理看着那高大的房屋对首相说：“过去地主的房屋也没这样好！”并且向胡银林开玩笑说：“你们现在的生活比地主还强了”，首相又爽朗地笑了起来，说：“这房子的确不错。”
    金日成首相和周总理又乘汽车到七星大队去访问。在那里，贵宾们首先参观了一块小麦丰产田。这块田的苗子已经长得有五寸来高了，绿油油的，看起来实在可爱。金日成首相、朴正爱副委员长和贺龙副总理等先走到麦田里去，随着周总理和其他贵宾们也走了进去。在田边的木牌上写着：这块小麦田的丰产指标是亩产一万五千斤到二万斤。
    “长得不错！”金日成首相说。
    离开丰产田，贵宾们继续参观。这时，沿途站满了夹道欢迎的人群，基干民兵们佩带着“野战部队”的符号，有的拿着农具，一个个精神抖擞。这时，张体学省长对首相说：“你看！他们是野战部队。”首相一面笑着走过去和他们握手。
    在去公社卫生院，首相看到路旁有一部拖拉机，就问胡银林：现在有多少拖拉机，胡银林回答说有十一部，明年还计划买二十部。首相听了很高兴。
    在卫生院里，首相仔细观看了病室和药品。这里有个叫李敬敏的女医生，曾经参加过赴朝医疗队，首相听说后，热情地和她握手，朴正爱副委员长还亲自把一个“朝中友谊纪念章”给她带在胸前。随后，首相又和一个行医五十年的老中医作了亲切交谈。
    金日成首相和朴正爱副委员长特别有兴趣地访问了七星大队的敬老院。这个敬老院里住着二十多个老人，年纪最高的已经八十岁，他（她）们每人有一间屋子和一套家具，包括衣柜、脸盆、毛巾、床、镜子等，室内打扫得很干净，一看就给人以舒畅的感觉。首相亲切地和七十九岁的老人严寿田等交谈起来，首相说：“你们生活在好时代，应该多活些年，祝你们都长寿！”在另一间屋子里，朴正爱副委员长和七十五岁的陈老大娘交谈了很久，关切地了解了她过去生活情形。
    参观幼儿园的时候，首相喜爱地爱抚着那些天真活泼的孩子，并向教养员周桂芝询问了孩子在园内的生活情况，临行的时候，首相把一个小孩送给他的鲜花送给了另一个小孩，其他贵宾也把刚才社员们献的花分别赠送给孩子们和教养员们。孩子们天真地和贵宾们握手，叫“伯伯再见”，“阿姨再见”。
    金日成首相和贵宾们在这个公社参观和访问了大约四个钟头，参观结束后，还和社员们一道在公社的食堂里吃饭，社员们用自己认为最好的菜饭来招待首相和贵宾们。吃饭时，首相和曾经是志愿军、在朝鲜参加五次战役和上甘岭战斗的黄才福坐在一起，黄才福现在在公社红旗中学做共青团的工作，席间他们像亲人一样地交谈着，有时用朝鲜话，有时用中国话，快分手的时候，首相把一枚“朝中友谊纪念章”送给了黄才福，并且鼓励他说：“你过去在战争中表现得很好，祝你今后在工作中能做出更大成绩。”黄才福说：“我一定要这样做。”
    贵宾们在下午三点半钟离开这个公社，这时全社男女老幼依依不舍地来欢送首相。当车队已经离去很远的时候，人们还久久地遥望着车队消失的远方。
