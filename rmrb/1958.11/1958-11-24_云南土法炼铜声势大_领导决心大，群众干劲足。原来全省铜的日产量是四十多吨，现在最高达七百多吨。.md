Yunnan's Indigenous Copper Smelting Gains Momentum
Leaders show great resolve, and the masses are full of enthusiasm. The province's original daily copper production was more than forty tons, but now it has reached a maximum of more than seven hundred tons.

(Our dispatch) This is a report from our reporter Zhang Tinggan: Yunnan Province has organized a copper smelting army of more than one million people, vigorously engaging in an indigenous copper smelting campaign. On November 18, the province's daily copper production reached more than seven hundred tons.

After the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued instructions to vigorously develop the copper and aluminum industries, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, based on Yunnan's relatively abundant copper mineral resources, decided to promote copper to the "deputy commander" position, organizing a mass copper smelting campaign to produce as much copper as possible to supply the needs of national construction. Party committees at all levels grasped the leadership of the copper smelting industry as tightly as they grasped steel production. From the frontier to the interior, the broad masses debated the significance of vigorously engaging in copper smelting. From the end of September to mid-October, the province's copper smelting team quickly increased from more than 70,000 people to 1,080,000 people, building approximately 30,000 indigenous copper smelting furnaces. Daily copper production increased from more than forty tons to several hundred tons. The highest daily output of six counties and cities reached more than ten tons.

The great resolve of the Party committee and the full enthusiasm of the masses are the prominent characteristics of Yunnan's all-people copper smelting movement. In Huize County, the First Secretary served as the General Commander of copper smelting, transferring thirty-seven leading cadres above the level of District Committee members, including three County Party Secretaries and six County Party Committee members, to lead the copper smelting movement. The Prefectural Party Committee Secretary of the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture participated in production at the furnaces, and the First Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee even drove a car to transport ore and fuel for the copper mine. In Jinghong County, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, the command headquarters, headed by the County Party Committee First Secretary, lived in the copper mine, both commanding and smelting copper together with the Dai and Hani people. The old "Zanha" (folk singer) of the Dai people was moved and sang by the furnace.

After the broad masses stepped onto the copper smelting front, Party organizations at all levels immediately organized the masses to give full play to their collective wisdom and tackle technical hurdles. At present, no fewer than ten thousand people throughout the province have learned indigenous copper smelting techniques; in Chuxiong Autonomous Prefecture alone, there are more than three thousand people. Mouding Copper Mine has developed from two veteran craftsmen to four generations of masters and apprentices, and many young men and women became furnace chiefs after only ten days of work. People of all ethnic groups have also created many better furnace types. The iron pot copper smelting method created by Yongsheng County is simple and easy to implement. With just two iron pots and a bellows, twenty kilograms of copper can be produced every day. The "Leap Forward Furnace" created by Mouding Copper Mine has consistently led in production. Many indigenous machines and inventions have emerged in areas such as air blowing, transportation, mining, and ore dressing. The indigenous gravity ore dressing method successfully tested at Mouding Copper Mine has broken the conventional wisdom in books that "copper ore is not suitable for gravity separation."

At present, Yunnan Province's all-people copper smelting movement is on the eve of a new high tide. Nearly 20,000 new furnaces are about to be put into production, and more than 20,000 bellows, nearly 200,000 tons of copper ore, and a large amount of fuel are being continuously transported to various furnace groups. An array of ten thousand furnaces firing simultaneously is gradually unfolding. (Attached Image)

    云南土法炼铜声势大
    领导决心大，群众干劲足。原来全省铜的日产量是四十多吨，现在最高达七百多吨。
    本报讯　记者张廷干报道：云南省组织一百多万人的炼铜大军，大搞土法炼铜运动。11月18日，全省日产铜达七百多吨。
    党中央和国务院发出大力发展铜铝工业的指示以后，中共云南省委根据云南铜矿资源比较丰富的情况，决定举铜为“副帅”，组织开展群众性炼铜运动，尽量多产铜来供应国家建设需要。各级党委像领导钢铁生产一样抓紧了对炼铜工业的领导。从边疆到内地，广大群众辩论了大搞炼铜运动的意义。从9月底到10月中旬，全省炼铜队伍很快就由七万多人增加到一百零八万人，建起了约三万个炼铜土炉。铜的日产量由四十多吨增加到几百吨。有六个县、市的最高日产量达到十吨以上。
    党委的决心大、群众的干劲足是云南全民炼铜运动的鲜明特点。会泽县由第一书记担任炼铜总指挥，抽调了包括三个县委书记、六个县委委员在内的三十七名区委委员以上的领导干部领导炼铜运动。楚雄彝族自治州的地委书记到炉子上参加生产，地委第一书记还自己驾车为铜矿运矿石和燃料。西双版纳傣族自治州景洪县以县委第一书记为首的指挥部住在铜矿，一面指挥，一面和傣族、哈尼族群众一起炼铜。傣族的老“赞哈”（民间歌手）被感动得到炉边歌唱。
    广大群众走上炼铜阵地以后，各级党组织立即组织群众发挥集体智慧猛攻技术关。目前，全省学会土法炼铜的已不下万人；仅楚雄自治州就有三千多人。牟定铜矿已由两个老师傅发展到师徒四代，不少青年男女上阵十几天就当了炉长。各族群众还创造了许多较好的炉型。永胜县创造的铁锅炼铜法，简便易行，只要两口铁锅，一个风箱，每天就能出铜二十多公斤。牟定铜矿创造的“跃进炉”，在生产上一直领先。在鼓风、运输、采矿、选矿等方面，已经出现了许多土机械和发明创造。牟定铜矿试验成功的土法重力选矿，就打破了书本上“铜矿不适于重选”的陈规。
    目前，云南省全民炼铜的运动正处在一个新高潮的前夕。近两万座新炉子即将投入生产，两万多个风箱、近二十万吨铜矿石和大量的燃料，正源源运往各个炉群。一个万炉齐发的阵势已经逐渐摆开。（附图片）
