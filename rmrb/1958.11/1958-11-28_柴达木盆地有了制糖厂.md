    A Sugar Factory in the Qaidam Basin
    The first beet sugar factory in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province has been completed and put into production in Golmud. This sugar factory is an affiliated unit of the Golmud Farm. The existing factory building covers an area of 800 square meters and has five workshops. According to the design capacity, it can produce 180,000 jin of sugar per month. At present, the factory is producing sugar using indigenous methods and is preparing to gradually transition to mechanized production.
    Many of the saline-alkali lands in the Qaidam Basin are very suitable for growing sugar beets. The sugar industry has a great future here. In the past, all the sugar needed in the Qaidam Basin was transported from thousands of miles away. Now, the people here can eat locally produced white sugar.

    柴达木盆地有了制糖厂
    青海省柴达木盆地的第一个甜菜制糖厂在噶尔穆建成，并开始生产。这个糖厂是噶尔穆农场的一个附属单位，现有厂房的面积是八百平方公尺，分五个车间，按照设计能力，每月可以产糖十八万斤。目前这个工厂用土法进行生产，以后准备逐渐过渡到机械化生产。
    柴达木盆地的许多盐碱地很适宜种植甜菜。制糖工业在这里很有发展前途。过去柴达木盆地里需用的食糖，都从几千里以外运来。现在，这里的人们可以吃到本地制造的白糖。
