(Our Dispatch from Jinan, November 18th) Reporter Hu Lei reports: The implementation of democratic management in people's communes is a crucial key to improving production and consolidating the communes. This has been powerfully proven in the actual work of the Licheng County East Suburb People's Commune over the past two months.

This commune was established in early September and immediately投入[tóurù, throw into; put into; invest] itself into the intense Three Autumn Campaign. The Commune Party Committee and Management Committee absorbed the masses into participating in production management, submitting the wheat planting plan, output, measures, and plots to the masses for free airing of views, debate, and discussion. The masses worked and discussed simultaneously, deliberating for half a month and revising the plan three times, making it richer and more practical than the leadership's original plan. Initially, the commune leadership proposed planting 60,000 mu, dividing it among 16 large teams and 156 companies according to land ratios. Representatives of the commune members and team cadres took this plan to the masses for discussion. The masses suggested that it should not be distributed evenly but planted according to local conditions. The plains with good water conservancy conditions could be planted more, while hills and mountains could be used for afforestation and expanding livestock farms, and sandy land could be used for planting more cotton and sweet potatoes. The commune revised the plan based on these opinions. The original target for output was 10,000 jin per mu, but due to a lack of fertilizer, many cadres lacked confidence. However, during the mass debate, eleven sources of fertilizer were proposed, which could achieve 200,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, striving for an output of 15,000 jin per mu. When plowing began, the county committee required a general deep plowing of 1.5 to 2 chi, but the tractors could not plow deeper than 1 chi, and livestock-drawn plows required two passes to reach slightly more than 1 chi. What to do? Relying solely on manual digging could not complete the task on time. At this point, some cadres wavered, and some masses whispered that it was impossible. The Commune Party Committee held a position meeting in the Daxin team, where all cadres and some experienced farmers studied and researched while working. As a result, a plowing method combining human and animal power, and human and tractor power, was found, which not only met the requirements of deep plowing but also increased efficiency by 50% to 100%. Later, everyone relied on their ingenuity to create rope-pulled plows and electric plows, and the cadres led the way in spreading the experience. Regarding sowing methods, the commune leadership initially proposed some inappropriate ideas, such as cross-sowing and watering after sowing. The masses criticized these ideas and proposed reasonable suggestions for watering before sowing and strip sowing or broadcasting. After the wheat seedlings emerged, some early-season wheat tips turned yellow. What was the reason, and how should it be solved? The leading cadres had no idea, so they convened a forum of experienced farmers. Finally, three reasons were identified: first, the fertilizer was applied too deeply and could not be utilized immediately; second, the quality of plowing was poor, and the harrowing was rough, causing air leaks underground; and third, the topsoil was not covered, and the subsoil was turned up, causing the seedlings to become cold. Based on these opinions, the Commune Management Committee immediately launched a campaign of topdressing and watering. The masses, upon hearing these reasons, were convinced and worked hard. From the perspective of this commune's wheat planting process, any production task, from planning to action, must involve the participation of the masses in management to achieve satisfactory results.

However, some cadres in this commune developed a simplistic work style after the commune implemented the "Three-izations." They believed that militarization meant simply issuing orders, and that once something was arranged, there was no need to consult with the masses or conduct ideological work. As a result, they stumbled and suffered losses in their work. For example, this was the case with autumn harvesting and animal husbandry in some production teams. The leadership of some teams neglected autumn harvesting, neither studying it carefully nor listening to the opinions of the commune members. The harvest was late, and much was damaged. The masses said, "The cadres don't know how to manage life; things right at their mouths are ruined." Later, the Party Committee instructed to rush the autumn harvest, but it did not mobilize the masses to discuss quality. As a result, some people were only interested in speed, leaving behind many sweet potatoes, so a second autumn harvest had to be carried out. During the intense "Three Autumns" campaign, the masses had no time to separately feed chickens and pigs. Some people suggested handing them over to the commune for public feeding. The commune also decided to collect the commune members' chickens and pigs and raise them collectively in the large teams. Such a major matter should have been discussed by the masses and decided by the commune member representative meeting, with specific measures stipulated. However, some teams simply made an arrangement and started. As a result, the masses did not understand the reasons, and some killed chickens and smashed pigs, refusing to hand them over to the commune. These things were in stark contrast to wheat planting, powerfully illustrating that two different approaches produced two different results. The leading cadres of this commune said: We have deeply experienced from actual practice that after implementing organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization, we must also implement management democratization. Boldly and freely promoting democracy, following the mass line, and broadly absorbing the masses to participate in the management of all affairs of the commune can further concentrate the wisdom of the masses, give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, and do a good job in production and life.

From the perspective of this commune, the central key to implementing democratic management is the democratization of the cadre's work style, becoming one with the masses everywhere, and using every opportunity to allow the masses to speak freely, placing the cadres under the supervision of the masses. For example, during the rush to harvest rice, the weather was cold and the water was cool. Some people were unwilling to work early in the morning and late at night, and the progress was very slow. Li Jiwu, deputy secretary of the Commune Party Committee, discovered this problem and led the commune cadres to personally enter the water. The commune members of the Lengyang Brigade saw this and rushed up, increasing the number of people from 500 to 2,000, and 200 mu were harvested in no time. A few days earlier, the leader of the fourth company of this team called the commune members up to go to the field, while he went home to sleep. As a result, the commune members also fell asleep in the field. The cadres of Daxin Camp made the masses work 16 hours a day. The masses suggested taking a rest, but the cadres insisted. The masses were sleepy on the construction site and only sowed 30 mu of wheat per day. The cadres not only did not check their work methods but also blamed the masses for being backward. Later, according to the opinions of the masses, the masses were guaranteed adequate rest at night, and as a result, efficiency increased by more than double. The cadres received a profound education. They said, "It's not that the masses are backward, it's that we are subjective."

Now this commune has gradually improved the democratic management system through practical work. Their methods are: first, fully utilize big-character posters as a powerful tool for the masses to participate in management. In this commune, big-character poster stands are set up in all kinds of occasions, such as villages, fields, roadside walls, offices, and public canteens. Paper and pens are placed beside the stands, and commune members can make suggestions to anyone at any time. Since the "Three Autumns" work began, more than 50,000 big-character posters have been posted, many of which expose and criticize the shortcomings of cadres. There are also many mutual criticisms among the masses. Through this form, many people have developed a good habit of criticism and self-criticism. Tens of thousands of men and women in the labor force, when meeting and talking, many people ask to speak, and the mood is very enthusiastic. Second, absorb the masses to participate in various organizations to manage all affairs of the commune. The commune has a commune member representative meeting. All major matters such as production plans, financial budgets and final accounts, distribution, and cadre appointments are discussed and decided by the representative meeting. The production planning committee, the scientific research committee, the canteen, the nursery, and the happiness courtyard all absorb representatives of the masses from all aspects as members, and irregularly convene "Zhuge Liang" meetings to specifically listen to the opinions of the masses. All expense accounts are periodically announced to the masses for review. All labor disciplines are also discussed and approved by the masses.

    “三化”加“一化”  集中又民主
    历城东郊公社管理民主化
    广泛吸收群众参加生产、生活、经济、财务和劳动管理
    本报济南18日电　记者胡雷报道：人民公社实行管理民主化，是搞好生产、巩固公社的重要关键，这在山东历城县东郊人民公社两个月来的实际工作中得到了有力的证明。
    这个社是在9月上旬建立起来的，建立后就投入了紧张的三秋运动。公社党委会和管理委员会，吸收群众参加生产管理，把小麦种植计划、产量、措施、地块，交给群众鸣放辩论，群众边干边议，酝酿了半月，修改了三次，比领导上的计划丰富和切实多了。开始公社领导上提出种六万亩，按土地比数分到十六个大队、一百五十六个连里。社员代表和社干部拿这个计划到群众中讨论，群众提出不能平均分配，要因地种植，水利条件好的平原地可以多种，丘陵地、山地可以植树造林，扩建畜牧场，沙地可以多种棉花、地瓜。公社里就根据这些意见修改了计划。产量指标，原来是计划亩产一万斤，因为肥料缺乏，许多干部信心不足，但是在群众辩论中，却提出十一种肥源，每亩可达到二十万斤肥，力争亩产一万五千斤。翻地开始了，县委要求普遍深翻一尺五寸到二尺，但是拖拉机还耕不到一尺，畜力拉犁套两下才达到一尺多，怎么办？光用人掘又不能按时完成任务，这时有些干部动摇了，有些群众也三三两两的议论着办不到。公社党委会就在大辛队召开了阵地会，全社干部和一部分老农在这里边干边研究，结果找到人畜结合、人和拖拉机结合的翻地法，不仅解决了深耕的要求，而且效率提高了50％到一倍；后来又依靠大家想办法创制了绳索牵引犁、电犁，干部们分头带领传播经验。在播种方法上，开始公社领导上也提出一些不合适的意见：如交叉播种、先播种后浇水等，群众对此提出了批评，并且提出了先浇水后播种，条播撒播的合理建议。麦苗出土后，一部分早茬麦干尖发黄。这到底是怎么回事？应该怎样解决？领导干部没有底，于是召开了老农座谈会，最后找出三个原因：一是肥料施的深，一时使不上劲；二是翻地质量差，打耙的粗糙，地下透风；三是熟土没盖在上边，把生土翻上来了，苗子发冷。公社管委会根据这个意见，立即发动群众开展了追肥浇水运动，群众听到这些道理，也很信服地抓紧干起来。从这个公社的种麦过程来看，一项生产任务，从计划到行动，都必须让群众参加管理，才能达到圆满的结果。
    但是，这个公社的有些干部，在公社实行了“三化”以后，产生了简单化的作风，他们认为军事化就是下命令，有了事一布置就行，不用和群众商量了，也不用进行思想工作了，结果碰了钉子，使工作受到损失。例如，秋收工作和饲养工作，有些生产队就是这样的。某些队的领导上忽视秋收工作，既不很好研究，又不听取社员意见，收的晚了，毁坏很多东西，群众说：“干部不会过日子，到嘴头上的东西又瞎掉。”后来党委指示突击秋收，但又未发动群众讨论注意质量，结果有些人光贪快，丢掉很多地瓜，只好又来了个二次秋收。在紧张的“三秋”运动中，群众没空分散喂养鸡、猪，有人提意见交社里公养，社里也决议把社员的鸡、猪，收到各大队集体喂养。这样一个大事情，是应该让群众讨论一番，由社员代表会作出决议，规定一些具体办法的，但是有些队里只简单一布置就动手了，结果群众不明白道理，出现了一些杀鸡、砸猪，不肯交社的现象。这些事情，恰恰和种麦形成显明的对照，有力说明了两种作法，产生两种结果。这个社的领导干部说：我们从实际运动中深刻体验到，在实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化以后，还必须实行管理民主化。大胆放手的发扬民主，走群众路线，广泛吸收群众参加管理公社的一切事务，才能进一步集中群众智慧，发挥群众的积极性，搞好生产搞好生活。
    从这个公社来看，实行民主管理的中心关键，是干部作风民主化，处处和群众打成一片，利用一切机会让群众畅所欲言，把干部置于群众监督之下。如在突击抢收水稻时，天冷水凉，一早一晚有些人不愿干，进度很慢，公社党委副书记李吉吾发现这一问题，带领社干部亲自下水，冷扬大队的社员看见了，一拥而上，由原来五百人增至二千人，不一会就割了二百亩。而在前几天，这个队的四连连长把社员叫起来下地，自己回家偷睡觉，结果社员在地里也睡起来。大辛营的干部一天让群众劳动十六小时，群众提意见休息一下，但是干部硬坚持，群众在工地上困了觉，一天只播小麦三十亩，干部不但不检查工作方法，还责备群众落后，后来根据群众意见，保证群众在晚上充分休息，结果，效率比以前提高一倍还多。干部受到深刻教育，他们说，“不是群众落后，是我们主观了。”
    现在这个公社从实际工作中，已经逐渐健全了民主管理制度。他们的做法：一是充分运用大字报作为群众参加管理的有力工具。这个社不管村庄、田园、路旁围墙、办公室、公共食堂等各种场合，都设有大字报台，台旁放着纸笔，社员可以随时随地给任何人提意见。“三秋”工作以来，共贴出大字报五万多张，其中揭发批判干部缺点的很多。群众之间互相批评的也很多。通过这种形式，已使很多人养成了批评与自我批评的优良作风，几万名男女劳动大军，在开会座谈的时候，都有许多人要求发言，情绪非常热烈。二是吸收群众参加各个组织，管理公社的一切事务。公社有社员代表会，一切生产规划、财政预决算、分配、干部任用等重大事项，都经过代表会讨论决议。生产计划委员会、科学研究委员会、食堂、托儿所、幸福院等都吸收各方面的群众代表参加为委员，并不定期的召开“诸葛亮”会，专门听取群众意见。一切开支账目，都定期向群众公布，交群众审查。一切劳动纪律，也都经群众讨论通过。
