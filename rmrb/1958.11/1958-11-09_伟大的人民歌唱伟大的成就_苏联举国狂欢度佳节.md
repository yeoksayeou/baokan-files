Xinhua News Agency, November 8th, Moscow dispatch from TASS: People throughout the Soviet Union are joyfully celebrating the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution.

From Cape Dezhnev on the Bering Strait in the east, to Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea in the west, from Murmansk on the Barents Sea in the north, to Kushka on the border with Iran in the south, all the people of the Soviet Union are reveling in celebration of the historically significant achievements made in the struggle to build a communist society.

The citizens of the Chukchi National District, the easternmost part of the Soviet Union, were the first to greet this festival. When November 7th arrived there, it was only 2:00 PM on November 6th in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union.

Traditional festive parades and military reviews by the working people were held in cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Tashkent, Alma-Ata, Tbilisi, Baku, Riga, and Ashgabat.

Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, presented a festive scene. After a military review by Soviet Marshal Chuikov, commander of the Kiev Military District, a grand parade of the working people began. The people of Kiev marched with banners and charts reflecting the achievements of the republic's working people. Today's Ukraine is one of the world's great industrial powers. It produces more pig iron than any other European country. Its machine-building and metal processing industries produce 150 times more than in 1913.

The residents of the hero city of Stalingrad joyfully celebrated the festival. On the eve of the October Revolution Day, in the construction area of the world's largest Stalingrad hydroelectric power station, the channel of the Volga River, a great Russian river, was blocked. During today's festive parade, the builders of the power station said that they would put the first generating units into operation this year.

Cotton farmers in Siberia, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan celebrated the October Revolution Day with high spirits. Siberia and Kazakhstan have reclaimed large areas of wasteland in recent years. This year, 2 billion poods of grain were purchased in the reclaimed areas. Cotton farmers in Uzbekistan have already delivered 2.3 million tons of cotton to the state this year.

The scientific staff and other personnel of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition, and all personnel of the Soviet Arctic scientific drifting ice station, celebrated the October Revolution Day together with the Soviet people.

Mass parades, garden parties, and performances were held throughout the Soviet Union's urban and rural areas to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 7th: Tonight, the whole of Moscow is immersed in a sea of festive joy. The entire city is brightly lit, filled with laughter and song. People are jubilantly celebrating this day of great historical significance, laughing at the great achievements of communist construction, and singing for a bright and splendid tomorrow.

Today was a rare clear winter day in Moscow. In the evening, stars twinkled in the sky above Red Square, and a constant stream of people danced and sang towards Red Square. At exactly eight o'clock, festive fireworks soared into the sky, people applauded, and parents lifted their children high above their heads so they could see the colorful spectacle.

Emerging from Red Square is Manezhnaya Square, where an open-air stage was overwhelmed by countless crowds, and musical and dance performances were taking place.

Tonight, various festive parties or open-air film screenings are being held in Moscow's thirty-three squares, and all the city's theaters and cinemas are filled with audiences. Moscow artists have performed more than 100 artistic performances for the working people.

Like all festive nights, many of Moscow's high-rise buildings are magnificently decorated with electric lights and neon lights. The most striking is the Central Telegraph Building on Gorky Street. In the center of the building hangs a huge banner reading "Greet the 21st Congress of the CPSU with New Labor Victories," below which is a portrait of Lenin and the Soviet national emblem, flanked by colorful, animated electric lights depicting the prospects of Soviet communist construction. People stopped and lingered as they passed this building.

People who liked to appreciate the festive night scene flocked to Lenin Hills, from where they could overlook Moscow. The entire city looked like a huge, sparkling gemstone, its light piercing the darkness like countless sharp swords and shooting into the boundless depths of the universe.

Tonight, how many Muscovites are immersed in excited memories and happy dreams. Everyone seemed to have become younger. Young men and women were naturally filled with the joy of youth, but even elderly white-haired people and children could not suppress the joy in their hearts. People went to the busiest streets to celebrate the joyous festival together.

    伟大的人民歌唱伟大的成就
    苏联举国狂欢度佳节
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：苏联全国各地的人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝十月革命四十一周年。
    东起白令海峡的德兹涅夫角，西至波罗的海的加里宁格勒，北起巴伦支海峡的摩尔曼斯克，南至同伊朗交界的国境线边的库什卡，全苏联的人民在狂欢，庆祝在争取建成共产主义社会的斗争中所取得的具有历史意义的成就。
    最先迎接这个节日的是苏联最东边的楚克奇民族区的公民。当这里11月7日到来时，在苏联的首都——莫斯科还只是11月6日下午二点钟。
    在莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、明斯克、塔什干、阿拉木图、第比利斯、巴库、里加、阿什哈巴德等城市都举行了传统的劳动人民的节日游行和阅兵典礼。
    乌克兰共和国首都——基辅呈现出一片节日的景象。在苏联元帅、基辅军区司令崔可夫阅兵以后，这里开始了劳动人民盛大的游行。基辅人民在游行时手执着横幅标语和反映共和国劳动人民所取得的成就的图表。现在的乌克兰——是世界大工业国之一。它炼出的生铁比任何一个欧洲国家都要多。这里的机器制造业和金属加工工业产品为1913年的一百五十倍。
    英雄的城市——斯大林格勒的居民欢乐地度着节日。在十月革命节前夕，在世界上最大的斯大林格勒水力发电站的建设地区，俄罗斯的一条大河——伏尔加河的河床被拦断了。在今天的节日游行的时候，电站的建设者说，他们在今年就让第一批联动机发电。
    西伯利亚、乌兹别克和哈萨克的棉农情绪高昂地庆祝十月革命节，西伯利亚和哈萨克在近年来开垦了大片的荒地。今年在开垦的地区采购了二十亿普特的粮食。乌兹别克棉农今年已经交给国家二百三十万吨棉花。
    苏联南极考察队的科学工作人员和其他工作人员，苏联北极科学浮冰站的全体人员，同苏联人民一起庆祝了十月革命节。
    苏联城乡各地纷纷举行群众游行、游园会和演出会，来庆祝十月革命四十一周年。
    新华社莫斯科7日电　今天晚上，整个莫斯科都浸沉在节日欢乐的海洋里。全城灯火通明，到处洋溢着欢笑和歌声。人们欢欣鼓舞地庆祝这个有伟大历史意义的日子，为共产主义建设的巨大成就而欢笑，为光辉灿烂的明天而歌唱。
    今天是莫斯科冬季少有的晴朗天气。晚间，红场上空星光闪闪，川流不息的人群载歌载舞地走向红场。八时正，节日的礼花升到了天空，人们鼓掌，父母亲们把孩子抱起来高高举在头上，好让他们看到这五彩缤纷的奇景。
    从红场出来就是练马广场，这里有一个露天大舞台，它已被数不尽的人流淹没了，台上进行着音乐舞蹈演出。
    莫斯科三十三个广场今晚都在举行各种节日晚会或放映露天电影，全市所有剧院和电影院都坐满了观众。莫斯科艺术家们为劳动人民作了一百多场艺术表演。
    和所有节日夜晚一样，莫斯科许多高层建筑物上都用电灯和霓虹灯装饰得辉煌壮丽。最引人注目的是高尔基大街上的中央电报大楼。大楼的正中悬挂着“以新的劳动胜利迎接苏共第二十一次代表大会”的巨幅标语，下面是列宁画像和苏联国徽，两旁都是用五彩的活动的电灯组成的描写苏联共产主义建设远景的图画。川流不息的人们在走过这座大楼时，都要停步留恋。
    喜欢欣赏节日夜景的人都涌向了列宁山，从这里俯瞰莫斯科，可以看到整个城市像一块巨大的五光十色的宝石一样，它的光芒像无数把利剑划破了黑暗，射向无边无际的宇宙深处。
    今夜，多少莫斯科人浸沉在兴奋的回忆和幸福的憧憬之中啊。大家都好像变得更年青了，青年男女们固然充满了青春的喜悦，就是白发老人和小孩也抑制不住心中的愉快。人们走到了最热闹的街上，共度欢乐的节日。
