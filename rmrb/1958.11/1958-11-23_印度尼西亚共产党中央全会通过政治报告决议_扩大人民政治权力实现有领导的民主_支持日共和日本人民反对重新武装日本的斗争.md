Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 22nd: The Seventh Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party concluded on the 21st, after holding a three-day meeting from the 19th.

The plenary session approved the political report made by the Party's General Secretary, D.N. Aidit, and passed a resolution on this political report. The meeting approved the draft outline prepared by the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party for the Sixth National Congress of the Party, and passed a resolution on the draft revisions of the Party Program and Constitution.

The meeting passed a resolution supporting the movement against the revival of Japanese militarism, and telegraphed the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, expressing support for the heroic struggle of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and the American military occupation.

The plenary session decided on the composition of the delegation of the Indonesian Communist Party to attend the 21st National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The head of the delegation is General Secretary D.N. Aidit; members include K. Supit, member of the Central Committee and Secretary of the North Sulawesi Party Committee; Hutapea, editor-in-chief of the Party's journal "Red Star" magazine; and Su Suwato, Minister of Women of the Central Committee.

The meeting also telegraphed the Communist Party of Chile, congratulating it on the success of its 11th National Congress, and sent a telegram of congratulations to the All-African People's Conference to be held in Accra.

The resolution passed by the meeting on the political report made by the Party's General Secretary, D.N. Aidit, stated that the conclusions drawn in the report on the international and domestic situation were correct, and it stipulated the political tasks for the Party in the near future.

The resolution pointed out that the Party's domestic policy is: to correctly resolve the various contradictions between the people and imperialism (primarily Dutch and American imperialism), and to defend and expand the people's political power, so as to further unite the people and advance on the path of guided democracy, realizing President Sukarno's program.

The resolution said that in Indonesia, liberal democracy is currently experiencing a crisis. This is due to the development of progressive forces and revolutionary nationalist forces headed by President Sukarno on the one hand, and the activities of elements attempting to establish a military government and other fascists on the other. The former demands the implementation of guided democracy and the realization of President Sukarno's program, namely, the establishment of a cooperative cabinet based on proportional representation; the latter demands, in accordance with the wishes of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the establishment of a military government like those that recently appeared in Pakistan and Thailand.

The resolution pointed out that the attitude of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party in agreeing with President Sukarno's initiative for guided democracy was very correct. The resolution went on to say that the people should be asked to continue to be vigilant against those adventurers in the military and political circles who attempt to use guided democracy to dissolve the various political parties.

The resolution said that, after reviewing the implementation of the government program by the Djuanda Cabinet, the Party's attitude towards this cabinet remains unchanged, namely, to support its progressive policies without reservation, to criticize its hesitant policies, to make it progress, and to oppose its policies that are detrimental to the people.

The resolution further pointed out, in analyzing the domestic situation, that the Indonesian people and government have taken important measures to resolve their contradictions with the imperialists, first and foremost by taking measures to give the number one enemy of Indonesia, the Netherlands, the "Revolutionary Government," the "Overall Struggle Charter" rebel group, and the "Islamic Army" a heavy blow, thus making the most important stubborn forces in the country (mainly that part represented by the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party in terms of political parties) increasingly isolated, and the progressive forces increasingly powerful. This has also made the united front between the progressive forces and the revolutionary nationalists headed by President Sukarno and the general middle forces increasingly united. On the other hand, the Indonesian people are increasingly feeling the ferocity of the American imperialists, and have launched corresponding counterattacks against the offensive of American imperialism. They are increasingly clearly aware that the American imperialists cannot thwart the Republic of Indonesia.

The resolution believes that the discussion in the political report on the international situation is correct. The resolution said that under this international situation, the Indonesian people must further strengthen and expand solidarity with the international proletariat and all forces in all countries fighting for peace and independence; must strengthen the demands of the world peace movement, which are consistent with the demands of the anti-colonialist movement; and must further promote the government's active and independent foreign policy.

The resolution said that in order to further develop the situation, Communists must further strengthen unity within the Party, continue to adjust the organization to adapt to the development of the situation, further strengthen ties with the broad masses, and strive to educate themselves with the science of Marxism-Leninism.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 22nd: It was announced here today that the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party passed a resolution supporting the Japanese people's opposition to the rearmament of Japan.

The resolution said that 1.5 million Indonesian Communists, more than 8 million voters who support the Party, and all the Indonesian people support the heroic struggle of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people, and resolutely oppose the American military occupation of Japan and the militarist policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The resolution said that the Indonesian people fully understand the fact that since American imperialism occupied Japan after the end of World War II, it has re-established and continuously strengthened Japanese monopoly capitalists and militarists, and regarded Japan as an aggressive base for imperialism to launch an atomic war in the Far East. The resolution pointed out that American monopoly capitalists plan to pull Japan, along with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Syngman Rhee clique, into the aggressive "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization." The resolution said that under the joint rule of American and Japanese monopoly capitalists, Japan is now once again becoming an aggressive force threatening Asian independence, security and peace.

The resolution said that the Japanese monopoly capitalists represented by Kishi Nobusuke are pursuing a foreign policy of following the United States, helping the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and creating disturbances in Asia, and are hostile to the People's Republic of China. Kishi Nobusuke is implementing a policy of militarizing Japan, and is attempting to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law," attempting to further suppress the Japanese workers' and democratic movements, depriving the Japanese people of their basic rights, and turning Japan into a police state.

The resolution said that the policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government run counter to the development of the Asian and world political situation.

The resolution pointed out that the current international situation is: the capitalist world is increasingly corrupt, the socialist camp is increasingly strong, and the anti-colonialist and anti-war forces in Asia and Africa are becoming increasingly strong. It is not so easy for Japanese militarists to find a place to grow and operate.

The resolution said that the strength and struggle of the Japanese people are now becoming stronger and more powerful. Under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party, the Japanese people have continuously launched large-scale mass movements in the struggle against American imperialism, Japanese militarism, and the revival of Japanese imperialism.

The resolution called on the Indonesian people, who have experienced the brutal rule of Japanese militarism, to take action to support the struggle against Japanese militarism and the revival of Japanese imperialism, and against the realization of the "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization," in order to defend Asian national independence and peace.

    印度尼西亚共产党中央全会通过政治报告决议
    扩大人民政治权力实现有领导的民主
    支持日共和日本人民反对重新武装日本的斗争
    据新华社雅加达22日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第七次全体会议（扩大）自19日起举行三天会议后，已经在21日闭幕。
    全体会议批准了党的总书记艾地所作的政治报告，通过了关于这篇政治报告的决议。会议批准了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会为党的第六次全国代表大会准备的提纲草案，并且通过了关于党纲和党章修改草案的决议。
    会议通过关于支持反对日本军国主义复活的运动的决议，并且打电报给日本共产党中央委员会，表示支持日本共产党和日本人民反对修改“警察官职务执行法”和美国军事占领而进行的英勇斗争。
    全体会议决定了印度尼西亚共产党参加苏联共产党第二十一次全国代表大会的代表团的组成。代表团团长是总书记艾地；团员有中央委员会委员、北苏拉威西党委书记卡·苏皮特，党的刊物
  “红星”杂志主编胡塔佩亚，中央委员会妇女部长苏·苏瓦托。
    会议还打电报给智利共产党祝它的第十一次全国代表大会获得成功，并且致电祝贺将在阿克拉举行的全非洲人民会议。
    会议通过的关于党的总书记艾地所作的政治报告的决议说，这个报告中就国际和国内形势所作的结论是正确的，它为党规定了今后短时期内的政治任务。
    决议指出，党的国内政策是：正确地解决人民同帝国主义（首先是荷兰和美国帝国主义）之间的各种矛盾，并且保卫和扩大人民的政治权力，以便进一步团结人民和在有领导的民主的道路上前进，实现苏加诺总统方案。
    决议说，在印度尼西亚，自由主义的民主目前正在发生危机，这是由于一方面进步力量和以苏加诺总统为首的革命民族主义力量在发展，另一方面企图成立军政府的分子和其他法西斯分子也在活动。前者要求实行有领导的民主和实现苏加诺总统方案，即建立以比例代表制为基础的合作内阁，后者则要求按东南亚条约组织的愿望，成立像最近在巴基斯坦和泰国出现的那样的军政府。
    决议指出，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局同意苏加诺总统首创的有领导的民主的方案，这种态度是非常正确的。决议接着说，应当要求人民继续对那些企图利用有领导的民主来解散各政党的军界和政界的冒险分子保持警惕。
    决议说，在回顾了朱安达内阁执行政府计划的情况以后，党对这个内阁的态度继续不变，即无保留地支持它的进步政策，批评它的犹豫政策，使它进步，并且反对它的不利于人民的政策。
    决议在分析国内局势时进一步指出，印度尼西亚人民和政府采取了重要措施来解决他们同帝国主义者之间的矛盾，首先是采取措施给印度尼西亚的第一号敌人荷兰、“革命政府”和“全面斗争约章”叛乱集团以及“伊斯兰教军”以沉重的打击，因而已经使国内最主要的顽固力量（在政党方面主要是由马斯友美党和社会党所代表的那一部分）越来越孤立，使进步力量越来越强大。这也已经使进步力量和以苏加诺总统为首的革命民族主义者同一般中间力量之间的统一战线越来越团结。另一方面，印度尼西亚人民越来越感到美帝国主义者的凶恶，并且对美帝国主义的进攻进行了相应的还击。他们越来越清楚地认识到，美帝国主义者是挫败不了印度尼西亚共和国的。
    决议认为政治报告中关于国际形势的论述是正确的。决议说，在这种国际形势下，印度尼西亚人民必须进一步加强和扩大同国际无产阶级和各国为争取和平和独立而斗争的一切力量的团结；必须加强世界和平运动的要求，这种要求同反殖民主义运动的要求是一致的；并且必须进一步推进政府的积极和独立的外交政策。
    决议说，为了使局势得到进一步的发展，共产党人必须进一步加强党内的团结，继续调整组织以适应局势的发展，进一步密切同广大群众的联系，并且尽力以马克思列宁主义的科学教育自己。
    新华社雅加达22日电　今天这里宣布，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第七次全体会议通过了支持日本人民反对重新武装日本的决议。
    决议说，一百五十万印度尼西亚共产党员、八百多万支持党的选民和全体印度尼西亚人民都支持日本共产党和日本人民的英勇斗争，坚决反对美国对日本的军事占领和岸信介政府的军国主义政策。
    决议说，印度尼西亚人民完全了解这个事实：自从美帝国主义在第二次世界大战结束以后占领日本以来，重新扶植和不断加强了日本垄断资本家和军国主义者，把日本当作帝国主义在远东发动原子战争的侵略基地。决议指出，美国垄断资本家计划把日本同蒋介石集团和李承晚集团一起拉入侵略性的“东北亚条约组织”。决议说，在美国和日本垄断资本家的联合统治下，日本现在再度成为威胁着亚洲独立、安全和和平的侵略力量。
    决议说，以岸信介为代表的日本垄断资本家在奉行着追随美国、帮助蒋介石集团和在亚洲制造骚乱的外交政策，并且敌视中华人民共和国。岸信介执行使日本军国主义化的政策，并且企图修改“警察官职务执行法”，企图进一步镇压日本工人和民主运动，剥夺日本人民的基本权利，把日本变成警察国家。
    决议说，岸信介政府的政策同亚洲和世界政治局势的发展是背道而驰的。
    决议指出，目前的国际形势是：资本主义世界日益腐朽，社会主义阵营日益强大，亚洲和非洲的反殖民主义和反对战争的力量越来越强大，日本军国主义者要想找到成长和活动的地方不是那么容易的。
    决议说，日本人民的力量和斗争现在变得更加强大和有力了。在日本共产党和社会党的领导下，日本人民在反对美帝国主义、日本军国主义和日本帝国主义复活的斗争中，不断地展开了大规模群众运动。
    决议号召经历过日本军国主义残暴统治的印度尼西亚人民采取行动，支持反对日本军国主义和日本帝国主义复活的斗争，反对“东北亚条约组织”的实现，以保卫亚洲民族独立和和平。
