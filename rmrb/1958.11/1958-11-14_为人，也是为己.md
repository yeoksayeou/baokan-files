    To Serve Others Is To Serve Oneself
    Liu Shuzhen, Member of Suicheng People's Commune, Xushui County

    I was happy from the bottom of my heart when the people's commune was established. Thinking about it, such good days have come, and I haven't contributed much myself. Now, to build our commune, I want to do my best.

    Well, let's start with the house. My family lives in three rooms, and my two sons live at school. Comrades from above often come to my place to stay. A few days ago, it got cold, and the window paper was torn in several places. The battalion headquarters brought some newspapers for me to paste them up. I thought, not only is this unsightly, but the room is also dark, and the comrades would not be comfortable staying there. Coincidentally, I had saved ten eggs, which were meant for my sons to eat when they came home for vacation. I sold them all and bought white window paper for the comrades to paste on. There was no curtain in the south room, and the draft was quite strong. I was afraid the comrades would get cold, but I didn't have anything to use as a curtain. Then I thought, the mattress would be quite suitable. So I simply cut it in half, hanging one half and using the other half as a mattress. Someone asked me how I could bear to do that. What's there to bear? The comrades from above are working hard for us, how can I just watch them freeze? Later, I thought, why should I live in so many rooms alone? It would be better for the comrades to live comfortably. So I gave up the house and moved to the clothing factory to live.

    The sisters here all bring their meals back to eat, but there are no tables, so it's not very comfortable to eat. I have a square table at home, so I donated it. This way, we can sit around together, happily like a family. At first, there was no place to put the scraps of cloth and thread ends, and they were thrown all over the ground, which was dirty and a waste. I have a trunk at home, which was part of my dowry, so I brought it over to store these messy things. Later, there was no place to put the finished shoes, so I brought my cabinet from home.

    The laundry group didn't have a bucket for drawing water at the well, so I had one and brought it out for everyone to use. There weren't enough farm tools during the autumn harvest, and the commune needed rakes, so I had one and brought it out too. Anyway, let me just say that whatever the commune needs, as long as I have it, I'll let everyone use it.

    I didn't take out these things to engage in "communization." I understand that communism doesn't turn these personal things into public property. I feel that we should contribute more when we are building the commune and when we are still facing difficulties, so that we can help build it quickly. Besides, the little things I've taken out are nothing compared to the good life we have now. When I was just over twenty, my husband died. A widow raising two children had difficulty with food and clothing, and couldn't afford to send the children to school. Those hard days were torturous. Now, in terms of food and clothing, everyone has thought of everything for us, and the children are all in school. It's really like stepping up to heaven in one step. I often think that this good life is created by everyone's hard work, and I must do my part. This is for others, and also for myself.

    Moreover, once the commune is well-established, everything will develop. Who will still care about those broken tables and benches? Even the houses will be replaced with new ones. Everyone thinks about what is the foundation of building a good commune, isn't it still production? Therefore, I can't put down my shoe soles. The commune members are fighting hard, and I must fight hard too. Winter is coming, and no matter what, I can't let everyone's feet get cold.

    为人，也是为己
    徐水县遂城人民公社社员　刘淑珍
    成立了人民公社，我打心眼里高兴。想一想，来了这种好日子，我自己没出甚么力量，现今，来建设咱们的公社，我就想怎么着也要尽尽自己的心意。
    好，就先说房子。我家住三间房，两个儿子上学住在校里。上边来的同志，就常常到我那儿借宿。前些天，天冷了，窗户纸破了几块。营部里拿来几张报纸，让我糊一糊。我一想，这难看不说，屋子里也黑，同志们住着多不安适。凑巧我攒了十个鸡蛋，是留给儿子放假回来吃的，我就都卖了，买了白窗纸给同志们糊上。南屋没有门帘，穿堂风挺大，我怕同志们冷着，可又没甚么可以做门帘，后来一想，褥子倒挺合适，我就干脆一剪两半，挂一半，铺一半。有人问我怎么舍得？那有啥舍不得。上面来的同志都是为我们操劳的，咱还能干看着他们受冻？后来我又想，我一个人干么住这么多房，让同志们住得松松快快多好，就把房子让出来，自己搬到被服厂这儿来住。
    这儿的姐妹都把饭打回来吃，可是没有桌子，吃得怪不舒坦。我家里有一张方桌，我就献出来，这么着围在一块，乐乐合合像一家人。起先，这儿布头线尾的没处盛，扔了一地，又脏又可惜。我家里有个箱子，是我陪嫁的，也给我拿来了，好装这些乱东西。后来做好的鞋没处放，我就把家里柜子拿来了。
    洗衣组上井台打水没有水桶，我有一只，就拿出来大伙用。秋收农具不够，社里用耙子，我有一把，也拿出来了。反正这么说吧，社里要用甚么，只要我有的，我就给大家用。
    我拿出这些东西来，并不是闹“共产”，我也明白，共产主义并不把个人的这些东西变成公有。我是觉着，正在建设公社，当我们还困难的时候，自己应该多出些力，好帮凑着快快地把它建设好。再说拿出的这一点点东西，比起现在得来的好日子，真是天上差到地下。我二十岁刚出点头，男人就死了。一个寡妇拉扯两个孩子，吃穿都困难，孩子念书也供不起，那种苦日子折磨死人。现在呢，论吃，论穿，哪样大家都给想到了，孩子们也都上了学，真是一步登了天。我常常想，这种好日子，是大家伙劳动创造的，我也得尽我一份力量。这是为人，也是为己。
    何况，公社一搞好，样样都有发展，谁还希罕那么些破桌子，凳子，就连房子也要换成新的了。大家想想，搞好公社归根到底在甚么，还不在生产？所以我鞋底不能离手。社员们苦战，我也得苦战，眼下就要到冬天了，不管怎么着，也不能让大伙冻了脚。
