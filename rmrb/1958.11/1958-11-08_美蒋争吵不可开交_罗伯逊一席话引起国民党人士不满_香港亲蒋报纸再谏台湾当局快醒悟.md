Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 6th: Hong Kong pro-Chiang newspapers reported that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson's remarks on November 3 concerning the Taiwan authorities' "non-use of force" have deepened the "doubts" of Kuomintang figures in Taiwan. The newspapers believe that Robertson's remarks were sharply opposed to those of Chen Cheng, the "Vice President" of the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, the day before. Robertson said that the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group would not take offensive actions against mainland China without U.S. consent, including sending troops to "aid anti-communist rebellions on the mainland." Chen Cheng, on the other hand, said that if Chiang Kai-shek's army decided to take action, "eight or nine times out of ten, there will be no time to consult with our American allies."

The "South China Daily" published a Taipei dispatch on November 5, stating that Kuomintang figures in Taiwan considered Robertson's remarks to be "blunt" and "contradictory" to the statement made by U.S. State Department spokesman White two days earlier (White stated on October 31 that the Chiang Kai-shek group would "not use force" to attack the mainland, but "does not rule out the use of force for self-defense or in the event of large-scale uprisings on the mainland" (i.e., the counter-revolutionary rebellion dreamed of by the United States)). The dispatch stated that "powerful figures" in Taipei expressed extreme dissatisfaction with Robertson's excessively interventionist remarks, and they will indicate that they will "not be subject to long-term U.S. restrictions."

The "Sing Tao Daily" editorial on November 6 also quoted Robertson's and Chen Cheng's remarks for comparison and expressed great dissatisfaction with the United States' "selfish" approach, disregarding the interests of the Chiang Kai-shek group. The editorial mentioned that some people pinned their hopes on the Chiang Kai-shek group taking advantage of the so-called "revolution on the mainland" to take action. It said that even if the Taiwan authorities took military action against the mainland, "it would be subject to many obstacles from the United States." It would be "held back" and "have its hands twisted" by the United States. The editorial believes that the Chiang Kai-shek group and the United States "clearly have differences" on the issue of the so-called "non-use of force." The editorial said: This may be because of the U.S. congressional elections, "however, the U.S. government cannot be so selfish as to only care about its own survival and not care about the demise of its allies!" The editorial wrote: "Mid-term (congressional) elections have an impact on the U.S. government, but it is not a matter of life and death. Whether to counterattack the mainland or not is a matter of life and death for the Republic of China (Chiang Kai-shek group). It is too offensive to ask allies to sacrifice themselves and ignore their life-and-death situation. The National Government (Chiang Kai-shek group) seems willing to sacrifice for its allies, and in fact, the sacrifice is great. However, such sacrifices will not have a good impact on the overall situation." It said with great dissatisfaction: "The U.S. government's weakness towards the CCP and its sacrifice of allies gives people a bad impression and gives people the impression of a defeatist."

The "Universal Daily" commented on November 5 that the Chiang-Dulles talks and the release of the joint communique had already caused "doubts and anger" among Kuomintang figures. Although the United States and Taiwan authorities have repeatedly explained, "the more they explain, the more confused they become." Now, Robertson has made remarks on November 3 that are diametrically opposed to those of the Taiwan authorities, "his words should be reliable." As such, "what else was in the results of the Chiang-Dulles talks besides the joint communique? This really makes us more and more doubtful." It said that the Chiang-Dulles talks communique "did not say that Taipei must seek U.S. consent in any circumstances to use force." Therefore, it is worried that this practice of the United States restricting the Taiwan authorities' actions may belong to a "secret agreement." The newspaper advises the Taiwan authorities to "strive to become strong" and that "relying on others is the most unwise thing to do."

### 美蒋争吵不可开交  罗伯逊一席话引起国民党人士不满  香港亲蒋报纸再谏台湾当局快醒悟

    美蒋争吵不可开交
    罗伯逊一席话引起国民党人士不满
    香港亲蒋报纸再谏台湾当局快醒悟
    新华社香港6日电　香港亲蒋报纸报道，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊3日关于台湾当局“不使用武力”问题的谈话，已经使台湾国民党人士的“疑虑”加深。报纸认为，罗伯逊的谈话同前一天台湾蒋介石集团“副总统”陈诚的谈话是针锋相对的。罗伯逊说，台湾蒋介石集团未经美国同意不会对中国大陆采取攻势行动，这包括出兵“援助大陆上的反共叛乱”在内。而陈诚说，蒋介石军队如果决定行动时，“十之八九将没有时间同我们的美国盟友商量”。
      “南中日报”5日刊登台北消息说，台湾国民党人士认为罗伯逊的谈话是“露骨”的，并且同美国国务院发言人怀特在两天以前的声明“互相矛盾”（怀特在10月31日曾经表示，蒋介石集团将“不使用武力”来进攻大陆，但“不排斥为了自卫或者在大陆发生大规模起义（即美国梦想的反革命叛乱）时使用武力）。消息说，台北“有力分子”对罗伯逊过分干涉的谈话极表不满，他们将表示“不受美国的长期限制”。
      “星岛日报”6日社论也摘引了罗伯逊和陈诚的谈话来互相对照，并且对美国不顾蒋介石集团利益的“自私”做法表示非常不满。社论谈到，有人寄希望于蒋介石集团利用所谓“大陆发生革命”而乘机行动的幻想，它说，即使台湾当局对大陆一旦有军事行动，“也会遭受到美国的诸多阻挠的”。它会被美国“拖住脚”和“扭着手”。社论认为蒋介石集团同美国对所谓“不使用武力”问题“显然有歧见”。社论说：这可能是因为考虑到美国国会选举，“但是，美国政府不能自私一至于此，只顾自己生存，不顾盟友死绝！”社论写道：“（国会）中途改选，对美国政府有影响，但并不是生死关头。反攻大陆与否却是中华民国（蒋介石集团）的生死关头，要盟友为自己牺牲，不理盟友生死关头，这，太令人起反感了。国民政府（蒋介石集团）看来愿为盟友牺牲，事实上牺牲很大。但是，这样牺牲下去，对全局亦不会有好的影响”。它十分不满地说：“美国政府对中共软弱，牺牲盟友，给人不好印象，给人一种失败主义者的印象”。
    “环球报”5日评论说，蒋介石杜勒斯会谈公报发表后，已经引起了国民党人士的“疑惧与愤怒”，虽然经过美国和台湾当局的一再解释，然而“越解释越糊涂”。现在，罗伯逊3日又发表同台湾当局针锋相对的谈话，“他的话照理应该是可靠的”，似此“蒋杜会谈结果除联合公报发表的以外，究竟还有些什么？这真是使我们越来越疑虑”。它说，蒋杜会谈公报“并未说在任何情况下台北使用武力均须征求美国的同意”，因此，它担忧美国这种束缚台湾当局手脚的做法可能属于一种“秘密协定”。这家报纸劝台湾当局“应奋发图强”，而“寄望于他人是最不智的”。
