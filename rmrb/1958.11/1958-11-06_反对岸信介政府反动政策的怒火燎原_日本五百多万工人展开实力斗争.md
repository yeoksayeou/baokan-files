Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 5th: Over five and a half million workers belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-Japan Federation of Labor Unions, the National Federation of Industrial Organizations, and neutral trade unions launched a massive and unprecedented struggle of strength throughout Japan today, opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

The Kishi Nobusuke government and Japanese monopoly capitalists had issued statements openly threatening workers, and today they also dispatched many police to suppress them. However, the workers resolutely carried out the struggle of strength according to the original plan. According to Kyodo News, the scale of this struggle by the Japanese working class greatly exceeded the expectations of the Kishi Nobusuke government authorities.

A large number of students and intellectuals from all walks of life also participated in today's joint struggle.

The Japan Coal Miners' Union, the National Metal Workers' Union, the All-Japan Federation of Metal Mine Workers' Unions, the Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation, the National Federation of Automobile Transport Workers' Unions, and the National Federation of Printing and Publishing Industry Workers' Unions, among others, held 24-hour strikes today.

The Japan Coal Miners' Union began its strike today when the first shift of workers started work at 7:00 a.m. Participants included 67,000 workers from 34 coal mines in Hokkaido, 100,300 workers from 78 coal mines in Kyushu, and 4,300 workers from Fukushima and Ibaraki prefectures. Workers from the five major companies belonging to the All-Japan Federation of Metal Mine Workers' Unions and 60 industrial unions also began striking with the first shift.

The National Railway Workers' Union, the National Railway Locomotive Workers' Union, the All Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union, the All Postal Services Workers' Union, the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Confederation, and the Japan Federation of Municipal Transport Workers' Unions, which have a great impact on Japan's postal, telecommunications, and transportation sectors, held workplace rallies for two to three hours each. Other unions in various industries also held various forms of struggle of strength.

The National Railway Workers' Union, the core of the unified struggle, held three-hour workplace rallies in more than 100 locations starting with the first train of the morning. Major railway lines such as Tokaido, Tohoku, Joban, and Joshinetsu, as well as some national railway trains, were temporarily suspended or delayed.

Approximately 70 companies, including the eight major companies belonging to the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Confederation, held one-hour strikes starting with the first train of the morning.

Teachers across Japan took leave of absence to protest the Kishi government's revision of the Police Law.

The Japanese people also held general mobilization rallies in various places today to oppose the revision of the Police Law.

In Tokyo, in addition to 2,000 women holding a demonstration, 4,000 students and 6,000 workers gathered in front of the Diet Building and held a demonstration, expressing their opposition to the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" and their indignation at the authorities' sudden extension of the Diet session.

In Kyoto, 5,000 workers and students held a general mobilization rally at Maruyama Park this afternoon. In Wakayama City, 3,000 workers and students held a general mobilization rally. Gatherings were also held in three locations in Nara Prefecture: Takada City, Nara City, and Gojo City.

Approximately 20,000 workers and students in Hyogo Prefecture held rallies in ten locations within the prefecture this afternoon, followed by lantern parades.

Approximately 10,000 union members in Kawasaki City participated in a general mobilization rally held this afternoon. Starting from a little after 6:00 p.m., they held a parade carrying approximately 5,000 lanterns. Masses in Urawa City and Maebashi City also held lantern demonstrations this evening.

The Osaka Prefectural Council of Trade Unions of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held a general upsurge rally in Osaka City this afternoon. Approximately 40,000 members of unions, democratic groups, and the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations participated in the rally. The rally adopted a resolution opposing the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and issued a declaration to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, followed by a demonstration.

In Fukuoka City, a rally with approximately 300 participants was held at Kyushu University from 10:30 a.m. Starting from 1:00 p.m., approximately 1,500 students from various universities held a protest rally in the city and held a demonstration in the city, calling on everyone to rise up and oppose the government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 5th: Fujiwara Mitsuo, Vice-Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, said today in a statement that today's joint struggle by more than five and a half million Japanese workers across the country, including all-day strikes, to oppose the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," is an unprecedented large-scale struggle of strength in the history of the Japanese labor movement. It is also a concrete manifestation of the workers' distrust of the Kishi Nobusuke government, their opposition to turning Japan into a war base, and their protest against the United States' threat to peace in Asia.

Fujiwara stated that Japanese workers will continue to carry out large-scale struggles of strength in the future, and will stand together with the people of the whole country to organize a people's general resistance movement in order to crush the reactionary war policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

Miyamoto Kenji, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out in a statement that today's unified action by Japanese workers is unfolding against the backdrop of consistent support from people of all social strata. In the future, people of all social strata in Japan will further support the workers' struggle.

Miyamoto pointed out that the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" has entered a new stage from today. Today's unified struggle of workers is only the starting point, not the climax.

Miyamoto firmly stated that the Japanese Communist Party demands the immediate dissolution of the Diet and resolutely launches a movement to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government. (Attached picture)
