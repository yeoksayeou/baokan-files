    Wood Replaces Iron, Indigenous Methods Combine with Foreign: All the Cotton is Being Spun Away.
    Zhejiang Promotes Wooden Spinning Machines

    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st dispatch) A kind of wooden, popular spinning machine is being promoted on a large scale in Zhejiang Province. At present, the province has already built and is in the process of manufacturing 200,000 spindles. The cotton-producing areas in urban and rural areas have already widely promoted wooden spinning machines; spinning factories with modern equipment in cities such as Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Huzhou have also added many such spinning machines. Residents in the Xiacheng District of Hangzhou City have also newly built 20,000 spindles and established many small, privately-run spinning mills. The Zhejiang Provincial Textile Industry Department has already made a plan to promote a total of more than 500,000 spindles by next year, which can produce about 50,000 pieces of medium-count yarn annually, increasing the province's spinning capacity by more than one-quarter.

    This kind of wooden spinning machine has low cost, is easy to manufacture, and the technology is easy to master. A spinning machine only uses 50 kilograms of steel. Except for bearings and gears, the rest of the parts are completely replaced with wood. The cost of each spindle is only about 5 yuan; any carpenter can manufacture it. This kind of wooden spinning machine can spin 6 to 12 count yarn, and one spindle can spin 2 liang (100 grams) of cotton yarn in eight hours. The quality of the cotton yarn is also good, and it can be used to make canvas, coarse cloth, and gloves.

    木代铁　土配洋　担担棉花全吃光
    浙江推广木制纺纱机
    本报杭州1日电　一种木制的普及式纺纱机正在浙江省大量推广。目前，全省已经造好和正在制造的有二十万纺锭。产棉区的城乡已经大量推广木制纺纱机；杭州、宁波、湖州等城市有近代化设备的纺纱工厂，也增添了不少这样的纺纱机。杭州市下城区居民也新造了二万纱锭，建立了不少民办的小型纺纱厂。浙江省纺织工业部门已经作出规划，准备到明年一共推广五十多万纱锭，可年产中支纱五万件左右，使全省纺纱能力增加四分之一以上。
    这种木制纺纱机成本低，制造简便，技术容易掌握。一部纺纱机只用五十公斤钢铁，除轴承和齿轮外，其余物件完全用木材代替。每个纺锭的成本只要五元左右；一般木匠都能制造。这种木制纺纱机可纺六支到十二支纱，一个锭子八小时能纺二两棉纱。棉纱质量也好，能做帆布、粗布和手套。
