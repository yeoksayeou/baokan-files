Xinhua News Agency, November 1st: The "Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor," jointly organized by the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, and twenty-seven provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions nationwide, grandly opened in the capital at 2:00 PM today.

Among those who attended the opening ceremony this afternoon were Zhang Jichun, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; Liu Aifeng, Ye Shengtao, Lin Liru, and Liu Zizai, Vice Ministers of Education; Hu Yaobang and Hu Keshi, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League; responsible comrades from other ministries and commissions of the Central Government; and representatives from provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and schools in the capital, totaling more than one thousand people.

The meeting was held at the Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, where Liu Aifeng delivered a speech. He said that with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the high tide of China's cultural revolution has begun. Teachers and students at all levels of schools across the country go to the mountains and countryside to participate in labor training, and run factories and farms on a large scale. Schools should not only cultivate new communist people, but also produce and trial-produce new products. Factories and agricultural cooperatives should run schools on a large scale, and factories and farms should not only produce material products and trial-produce new products, but also be responsible for cultivating new people. This has found a concrete form for the combination of education and productive labor, which facilitates the overall planning of classroom teaching and labor time, and creates favorable conditions for the implementation of the part-work, part-study system.

Liu Aifeng said: The combination of education and labor, with students studying and working at the same time, implementing a part-work, part-study system, has its advantages and it seems that it will soon become a common system. This is a major revolution in China's education. However, there are still some people who doubt this policy and have resistance to implementing it.

The practice of the past few months proves, and the exhibits of this exhibition can fully prove, that implementing the policy of combining education and labor, as long as the organization and leadership are good, will not only not reduce the quality of education, but will greatly improve moral, intellectual, and physical education.

Liu Aifeng then talked about how labor is changing the spiritual outlook of teachers and students from a political and ideological perspective. He said that the atmosphere of valuing labor has begun to take shape in schools across the country. In the process of labor, teachers and students have come into contact with the broad masses of workers and peasants and received profound education. The relationship between students and the working masses, the relationship between teachers and students, and the relationship between leaders and the led have become closer, and the atmosphere of the school is undergoing fundamental changes.

Liu Aifeng said that in terms of academic and scientific and technological level, there have also been amazing achievements due to the close combination of theoretical learning and production practice. Statistics from only 222 universities show that more than 56,000 inventions and improvements to tools have been made. Among them, some scientific research projects and trial-produced new products have reached the advanced domestic level in 2,480 items, and according to the data currently available to schools, 1,544 items have reached or even exceeded the advanced world level, exceeding the total achievements of the past few years.

Liu Aifeng said: The combination of education and productive labor is also of great significance in economic terms. According to incomplete statistics from twenty provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, factories in secondary schools and above can produce 1.31 million tons of iron, 275,000 tons of steel, 36,600 machines, and 1.93 million tons of various fertilizers by the end of the year, strongly supporting the country's industrial and agricultural construction. Liu Aifeng finally said: The above facts fully prove the correctness of the Party's education policy. The combination of education and productive labor is the correct path to develop education rapidly, well, and economically, and it is the correct path to cultivate new communist people who are both red and expert, capable in both literary and military fields, and comprehensively developed.

After Zhang Jichun cut the ribbon, the exhibition, which had been prepared for more than two months and had received attention from all parties, was officially opened.

The exhibits of the exhibition come from twenty-seven provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, all of which are the results of production research by schools in various places in the short period of several months in implementing the Party's policy of combining education and productive labor. There are tens of thousands of exhibits, large ones such as airplanes and automobiles, and small ones such as precision instruments and small bottles of valuable medicines. Many of them are at the cutting edge of science, such as accelerators and electronic computers, and some of them have reached or exceeded the international level.

The exhibition is tentatively scheduled to last for two months, ending at the end of December.

    培养共产主义新人的胜利
    教育与劳动生产相结合展览会昨天在首都隆重揭幕
    据新华社1日讯　中华人民共和国教育部、中国共产主义青年团中央委员会和全国二十七个省、市、自治区联合举办的“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”，今天下午二时在首都隆重揭幕。
    参加今天下午揭幕仪式的，有中共中央宣传部副部长张际春，教育部副部长刘皑风、叶圣陶、林砺儒、刘子载，团中央书记处书记胡耀邦、胡克实，中央其他部、委的负责同志以及各省、市、自治区和首都学校的代表等，共一千多人。
    大会在北京农业机械化学院举行，刘皑风在会上讲话。他说，随着工农业生产的大跃进，我国文化革命的高潮已开始到来。全国各级学校的教师学生上山下乡参加劳动锻炼，大办工厂、农场；学校不仅要培养共产主义的新人，也要生产和试制新的产品。工厂农业社大办学校，工厂、农场不仅要生产物的产品和试制新产品，也要负责培养新人。这就为教育与生产劳动结合，找到了具体的形式，便于统筹安排课堂教学和劳动的时间，为实行半工半读创造了有利的条件。
    刘皑风说：教育和劳动结合，学生一面读书，一面做工，实行半工半读，有它的优越性，看来不久会成为普遍的制度。这是我国教育上一次大革命。但是目前还有些人怀疑这个方针，对执行这个方针有抵触情绪。
    几个月来的实践证明，通过这次展览会的展品也可以充分的证明：执行教育与劳动结合的方针，只要组织领导得好，不但不会降低教育质量，而是在德育、智育、体育几方面都有很大的提高。
    刘皑风接着从政治思想方面，谈到了劳动正在改变着师生的精神面貌。他说，目前各地学校劳动光荣的风气已开始形成，师生们在劳动过程中接触了广大的工农群众，受到了深刻的教育。学生和工农群众的关系，师生关系，领导与被领导的关系，都更加密切了，学校的风气正在发生根本的变化。
    刘皑风说，在学业和科学技术水平方面，由于理论学习和生产实践密切结合，也有了惊人的成就。仅二百二十二所高等学校的统计，创造发明及改良工具共五万六千多项。其中有些科学研究项目和试制的新产品，达到国内先进水平的有二千四百八十项，根据学校现在掌握的资料已经达到甚至超过世界先进水平的有一千五百四十四项，超过了过去几年成就的总和。
    刘皑风说：教育和生产劳动相结合，在经济方面也有重大意义。据二十个省市自治区的不完全的统计，中等以上学校工厂到年底可以生产铁一百三十一万吨，钢二十七万五千吨，机器三万六千六百台，各种化肥一百九十三万吨；有力的支援了国家的工农业建设。刘皑风最后说：以上事实都充分证明了党的教育方针的正确。教育与生产劳动相结合是多快好省地发展教育事业的正确的道路，是培养又红又专、能文能武、全面发展的共产主义新人的正确道路。
    大会由张际春剪彩后，这一筹备两月多受到各方面重视的展览会，便正式展出。
    展览会的展品来自二十七个省、市、自治区，全部是各地学校在执行党的教育与生产劳动相结合方针当中，短短几个月内生产研究出来的成果。展品共有几万件，大的有如飞机、汽车，小的有精密仪器和小瓶装的贵重药剂，有许多是科学的尖端，如加速器、电子计算机等，有一部分是达到或超过国际水平的。
    展览会初步预定展出两个月，到12月底结束。
