Soaring to the Peak of Science at High Speed
—A Visit to the "Exhibition of the Combination of Education and Productive Labor"
By our staff reporter Cai Jianyuan

The Crystallization of Mental and Physical Labor

Stepping into the comprehensive hall of the exhibition, people immediately see a scene of vibrant colors and blossoming flowers, as if they have entered a grand garden, a palace of science! Look:

That is an "accelerator," a necessary tool for atomic energy scientific research. Some "authoritative professors" once shook their heads and said, "Manufacturing an accelerator is a fantasy." Now, various universities have designed and manufactured more than ten accelerators. That is a model of an "atomic reactor"! Four months ago, the Institute of Atomic Energy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences built China's first atomic reactor, opening the door to China's atomic energy science. Now, atomic reactors have also been built in universities. Want to play chess? You can play a game with that "dedicated" digital electronic computer, and it will declare: "You lost!" That "general-purpose" fast digital electronic computer, shining in five iron cabinets more than two meters high, allows young teachers and students to stand at a control panel and command it to perform two thousand calculations per second, as if playing a piano. With such a digital electronic computer, you can accurately calculate when an artificial satellite will fly over our heads in an instant.

The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel has researched and manufactured a new type of steel called "Steel King"—ultra-high-strength construction steel, with performance exceeding the American "trump card steel." The research achievements in steel by teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel alone number sixty or seventy items that have reached or exceeded the world's advanced level. Teachers and students at Jilin University have researched and used China's abundant tungsten and other materials to replace China's scarce nickel and chromium, creating a new type of steel called "Iron-Tungsten-Silicon." This is a world first! It establishes China's own heat-resistant alloy system.

"Program-controlled machine tools" were born at Tsinghua University. They pave the way for the comprehensive and highly automated mechanical processing in our country. The "AC calculating platform" is a powerful assistant to the general command of the power system, which will enable China's power system scientific research to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level more quickly.

The "48-day rapid wheat cultivation method" has been successfully tested; corn can be grafted with rice, allowing wheat endosperm to replace corn endosperm, turning corn into wheat. The world's latest type of "organophosphorus insecticide" has been trial-produced; the germination of potatoes can be inhibited, so people no longer need to worry about potato storage.

"Ion exchange resins" are cutting-edge scientific achievements in chemical engineering. They can turn seawater into fresh water, milk into human milk, and alkaline land into fertile land. They can separate substances that cannot be separated by physical and chemical methods and extract rare elements. They have various wonderful uses in industry, agriculture, medicine, scientific research, national defense, and people's daily lives.

The research conducted by teachers and students includes both cutting-edge research and a large amount of popularization; there are important research tasks assigned by the state, as well as small projects that are very meaningful for production. Teachers and students in universities have participated in research activities on an unprecedentedly wide scale, and many teachers and students in secondary schools have also made gratifying achievements. Even the Young Pioneers in elementary schools have made inventions and creations. In the past few months, according to statistics from 222 universities, more than 56,000 inventions and creations and tool improvements have been made, of which more than 1,500 have reached the world's advanced level, exceeding the total achievements of the past eight years. The "Exhibition of the Combination of Education and Productive Labor" is a summary of the crystallization of physical and mental labor of teachers and students.

Production Practice is a Magic Elixir

From the exhibition, it can be seen that an important reason why teachers and students can create miracles in scientific research is their close integration with the current social movements and their service to production. In supporting the Three Gorges project, many teachers and students in relevant majors in universities put forward the slogan "Fight for the Three Gorges." The construction of the unparalleled Three Gorges Hydropower Station requires solving a series of unprecedented scientific and technological problems. Among the 212 scientific research topics involved, university teachers and students are solely responsible for 48 items and collaborate with relevant departments on 96 items. Many university teachers and students have actively undertaken research tasks. Four hundred teachers and students from the Department of Water Conservancy at Tsinghua University formed a "Science Camp" and fully marched towards the scientific research of the Three Gorges. The "Three Gorges Hub Hydraulic Engineering Overall Model Test" they completed before National Day has already yielded results, such as canceling the downstream guide wall in the original design, which saves a large amount of reinforced concrete and can increase power generation capacity by 600,000 kilowatts, as well as reduce stone excavation by nearly one million yuan. Zhang Heqing, a student at Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy, proposed the "Low Cofferdam Construction and Diversion Proposal for the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River," which can save 300 to 400 million yuan in construction and diversion costs and also shorten the construction period by five years. These achievements were all obtained at the production site and cannot be compared with any "graduation design" that is just theoretical. The many achievements shown at the exhibition tell people that scientific research combined with social movements and serving production can produce cutting-edge scientific achievements. Production practice is the magic elixir for scientific research.

Scientific Research Should Involve Mass Movements

From the exhibits at the exhibition, a very important principle is conveyed: scientific research work should be carried out in the manner of a mass movement. During the design and manufacture of the "Nankai No. 1" atomic reactor by teachers and students of the Physics Department of Nankai University, two teachers did not understand the significance of mass movements, lost confidence in their work, and quit. The remaining teachers and students, under the leadership of the Party, were determined to complete the plan. Three students replaced the work of the two teachers and solved the problem that could not be solved in a week in three days. The narrator told people that one of the teachers who participated in this work had just returned from abroad not long ago. Originally, he thought it would take two or three years to build such an atomic reactor, but this time it only took more than two months. The teacher said with deep emotion, "Masses doing science can achieve high speed." While visiting the "General-Purpose Fast Digital Electronic Computer" designed and manufactured by teachers and students of the Electrical Engineering Department of the Northeast Institute of Technology, I met He Wenxing, a young teacher who participated in this work. I asked, "Who is the main worker?" He replied, "I can't say who is the main worker." He added: "The whole work process was a mass movement. The sixteen teachers and more than two hundred and thirty students who participated in the work were organized under the leadership of the Party. They did whatever they were told to do. From July 15th, they started learning and designing, and by October 9th, they had successfully manufactured it. The whole process was done collectively, so the speed could be so fast." The practice of each school has proven that carrying out mass movements can enable scientific research to leap forward at high speed.

The Flowers of Cooperation Bloom Everywhere

The communist style of cooperation has gradually formed among the vast number of teachers and students, so they can quickly overcome difficulties and achieve success in scientific research work. The exhibition has a chart that shows: Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the scientific and technological forces of teachers and students of universities in Shanghai and scientific research institutions and production departments have implemented large-scale cooperation. The thirteen municipal scientific and technological cooperation groups that have been established have identified more than 360 topics, promoting the development of science and technology. Their slogan is: "Organize and attack the cutting edge." At the exhibition, you can hear the following story: The pioneers of China's socialist construction, transportation, need a large number of heavy-duty diesel engines for giant ship engines, which China cannot manufacture. When relevant Chinese departments discussed the issue of data with a certain capitalist country, the other party tried to take the opportunity to seek exorbitant profits and imposed many difficult conditions on China. Teachers and students of Shanghai Jiaotong University were very indignant when they heard this news. They immediately cooperated with the Ship Research Office of the Ninth Bureau of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, Hudong Shipyard, and Shanghai Ship Repairing Factory to design and manufacture China's first 2,000-horsepower heavy-duty diesel engine in September this year, which can be used as an engine for ships of more than 3,000 tons; they are currently designing a 10,000-horsepower heavy-duty diesel engine for giant ocean-going ships. They deeply feel: "Cooperation has power!" Cooperation can give a strong response to the difficulties of capitalist countries and can march towards science at high speed. Now, teachers and students have generally implemented individual-to-individual cooperation, department-to-department cooperation, school-to-school cooperation, school-to-factory cooperation, and region-to-region cooperation. People can see the splendid flowers of cooperation everywhere.

Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods is a Magic Weapon

"Combining indigenous and foreign methods" is another magic weapon for the vast number of teachers and students to advance towards science at high speed. A quick tour of the exhibition reveals a series of research results with the word "indigenous" in them: indigenous uranium plants, indigenous power plants, indigenous motors, indigenous lathes, indigenous bearings... This is no exception in cutting-edge scientific research. Teachers and students at Peking University have made an "indigenous accelerator"; subsequently, teachers and students at Beijing Normal University also made an "indigenous accelerator." The "acceleration tube" is made by connecting medical equipment and discarded glass tubes after removing the bottom. The "acceleration electrode" is an aluminum medicine tray, as well as other indigenous methods, which greatly reduces costs. A simulated electronic computer manufactured by teachers and students of South China Institute of Technology is said to be "unattractive." A simulated electronic computer from Tianjin University is placed next to it. I asked a young teacher who was adjusting it: "The characteristic of that one from South China Institute of Technology is that it's indigenous, what about yours?" He immediately replied, "Ours isn't foreign either!" He gave me examples in succession. It turned out that it was just a matter of whether it was "indigenous" more or less. All indigenous methods are thought out and successfully practiced by teachers and students in productive labor. Under different conditions, indigenous methods can replace foreign methods or surpass foreign methods. Therefore, teachers and students are sure that science, including cutting-edge science, should be done with both indigenous and foreign methods.

Since the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor, most of the scientific research achievements of various schools have been obtained by the vast number of young teachers and students under the leadership of the Party, in a short time and under poor conditions. At present, many schools have adopted the practice of closely combining productive labor, teaching, and scientific research, that is, schools run factories and also conduct scientific research. Facts have proven that the three can promote and improve each other. The correct policy of combining education with productive labor will surely promote science to leap forward at a higher speed.

    高速度向科学顶峰飞跃
    ——“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”参观记
    本报记者　蔡鉴远
    脑力劳动与体力劳动的结晶
    跨进展览会的综合馆大厅，人们立刻看到那万紫千红、百花盛开的景象，好像到了一座大花园，到了一座科学之宫！你看：
    那是“加速器”，进行原子能科学研究必需的工具。一些“权威教授”曾经摇头说，“要制造加速器是异想天开”，如今，各高等学校设计制成的加速器已经有十多架。那是“原子反应堆”模型！四个月以前，科学院原子能研究所建成我国第一座原子反应堆，打开了我国原子能科学的大门。如今，高等学校里也建成了原子反应堆。要下棋么？你可以同那“专用”数字电子计算机下一盘，它会宣告：“你输了！”那“通用”的快速数字电子计算机，在五个两公尺多高的大铁柜里闪闪发光，年青的师生站在一个操纵台上，就可以像弹钢琴似地指挥它每秒运算两千次。用这样的数字电子计算机，瞬间就可以准确地计算出人造卫星什么时候从我们的上空飞过。
    北京钢铁学院研究制成了命名为“钢王”的新钢种——超高强度建筑钢，性能超过美国的“王牌钢”。仅北京钢铁学院师生完成的钢铁方面的研究成果，就有六、七十项达到和超过世界先进水平。吉林大学师生研究用我国丰产的钨等代替我国缺少的镍铬，制成了新钢种“铁钨硅”。这是世界首创！它为我国建立了自己的耐热合金系统。
    “程序控制机床”在清华大学诞生了。它为我国机械加工的全面高度自动化开辟了道路。“交流计算台”，是电力系统运行总指挥的得力助手，它将使我国电力系统的科学研究工作更快地赶上和超过世界先进水平。
    “48天快速小麦栽培法”试验成功了；玉米可以同水稻嫁接，让麦子的胚乳代替玉米的胚乳，玉米麦子化。世界上最新型的“有机磷杀虫剂”已经试制出来；马铃薯的发芽可以抑制，人们不必再为马铃薯的储存耽心了。
    “离子交换剂”是化工方面的尖端科学成就，它能使海水变淡水，牛奶变人奶，碱地变良田，它能分离用物理和化学方法不能分离的物质，提取稀有元素。在工业、农业、医药、科学研究和国防上以及人们日常生活中，它都有各种各样奇妙的用途。
    师生们进行的研究，有尖端的，也有大量普及的；有国家交给的重要研究任务，也有对生产很有意义的小项目。高等学校的师生空前广泛地参加研究活动，中等学校的不少师生也作出了可喜的成绩，甚至小学的红领巾也有了发明创造。几个月来，据二百二十二所高等学校统计，发明创造和改良工具共五万六千多项，其中达到世界先进水平的有一千五百多项，超过了过去八年成就的总和。“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”就是师生们体力劳动与脑力劳动结晶的总汇。
      生产实践是灵丹妙药
    从展览会上可以看到，师生们能在科学研究上创造出奇迹，一个重要的原因是紧密地结合当前的社会运动、为生产服务。在支援长江三峡运动中，许多高等学校有关专业的师生提出了“为三峡而战”的口号。举世无双的三峡水电站的建设，需要解决一系列科学技术上前所未有的问题。在有关的二百一十二项科学研究题目中，高等学校师生单独负责的有四十八项，同有关部门协作的有九十六项。许多高等学校师生都积极地承担了研究任务。清华大学水利系四百名师生组成了“科学营”，全力向三峡科学研究进军。他们在国庆节前夕完成的“三峡枢纽水工整体模型试验”，已经获得成果，如取消原设计中的下游导墙，就节省了大量钢筋混凝土，并可以增加发电能力六十万瓩，还减少了石方开挖近百万元。武汉水利学院学生张荷卿提出了“长江三峡低围墙施工等导流创议”可以节省施工导流费三、四亿元，还可以使施工期限缩短五年。这些成就都是在生产现场上获得的，都不是纸上谈兵的什么“毕业设计”可以比拟的。展览会显示的许多成就告诉人们，科学研究结合社会运动，为生产服务，可以搞出尖端科学成就来。生产实践是科学研究的灵丹妙药。
    科学研究要搞群众运动
    从展览会展出的实物中，告诉人们一条非常重要的原理：科学研究工作应当用搞群众运动的方式来进行。南开大学物理系师生在设计制造“南开一号”原子反应堆的过程中，有两个教师不理解搞群众运动的意义，工作失去信心，退出不干。留下的师生在党的领导下大家决心完成计划。三个学生代替了那两个教师的工作，在三天内就解决了原来一个星期没法解决的问题。说明员告诉人们，参加这项工作的一个教师不久以前才从国外回来，原来他认为建成这样一座原子反应堆要二、三年，可是这次只用了两个多月。这个教师深有感慨地说，“群众办科学就可以高速度”。在参观东北工学院电力系师生设计、制造的“通用快速数字电子计算机”时，我遇到了参加这项工作的青年教师何文兴。我问：“谁是主要工作人？”他回答：“说不出谁是主要工作人。”他又补充说：“整个工作过程是一个群众运动。参加工作的十六个教师、二百三十多个同学，在党的领导下组织起来，叫搞什么就搞什么，从7月15日开始学习和设计，到10月9日制造成功，整个过程都是集体搞的，所以速度能够这样快。”每个学校的实践都证明，搞群众运动可以使科学研究高速度跃进。
      协作之花到处开
    共产主义风格的协作，已经在广大师生中逐渐形成，因而他们能够在科学研究工作中迅速克服困难，取得成就。展览会上有一个图表标示：上海市高等学校师生同科学研究机关和生产部门的科学技术力量，在中共上海市委领导下实行大协作，目前已经成立的十三个全市科学技术协作小组，确定了三百六十多项课题，推动了科学技术的发展。他们的口号是：“组织起来，猛攻尖端”。在展览会可以听到这样一个故事：我国社会主义建设事业的先行官——交通，需要大批的重型柴油机用作巨型船舶的发动机，我国不能制造。当我国有关部门向某资本主义国家商谈资料问题时，对方就想借机谋取暴利，对我国提出了许多刁难的条件。上海交通大学师生听到这个消息十分愤慨，他们立即同第一机械工业部第九局的船舶研究室、沪东造船厂、上海船舶修造厂等单位协作，在今年9月里设计制造出了我国第一台两千马力的重型柴油机，可以用作三千吨以上轮船的发动机；目前正在为远洋航行的巨轮设计一万马力的重型柴油机。他们深深感到：“协作有力量”！协作可以给资本主义国家的刁难以有力的回击，可以高速度地向科学进军。现在，师生们普遍地实行了个人与个人协作，系与系协作，学校与学校协作，学校与工厂协作，地区与地区协作，人们到处可以看到那绚丽的协作之花。
      土洋结合是法宝
    “土洋结合”是广大师生高速度向科学进军的又一法宝。在展览会上稍一巡视，就可以看到一连串带“土”字的研究成果，土铀厂、土电厂、土电机、土车床、土轴承……。在尖端科学研究中也不例外。北京大学师生制成了一架“土加速器”；随后，北京师范大学师生也制成了一架“土加速器”，其中的“加速管”是用医疗器皿、废玻璃筒去底以后设法连接起来的，“加速电极”是一支铝制的药盘，还有其他土办法，成本因而大大降低。华南工学院师生制造的一架模拟电子计算机，人们说“其貌不扬”。天津大学的一架模拟电子计算机摆在它的旁边，我问正在进行调整工作的一位青年教师：“华南工学院那架的特点是土，你们的呢？”他立即回答：“我们的也不洋呵！”他连续给我举了例子，原来只是“土”得多一些或少一些的分别。所有的土办法，都是师生们在生产劳动中想出来并实践成功的。在不同的条件下，土的可以代替洋的，或者超过洋的。所以师生们肯定，搞科学、搞尖端科学都应该土洋并举。
    贯彻执行教育与生产劳动结合的方针以来，各学校的科学研究成果多数都是由广大青年师生在党的领导下，在时间较短、条件较差的情况下得到的。目前许多学校都出现了生产劳动、教学和科学研究密切结合的做法，即学校办工厂，同时也进行科学研究，事实证明，三者可以互相促进和提高。教育与生产劳动结合这一正确方针，必将推动科学以更高的速度飞跃前进。（附图片）
