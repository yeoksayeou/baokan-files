Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 7th. Hong Kong newspapers with ties to Taiwan today commented on the results of the U.S. Congressional elections, expressing unease about the prospects brought about by the Republican Party's crushing defeat, and advising the Taiwan authorities not to embark on the tragic path of being "manipulated and sold out."

The "South China Daily" published a Taipei dispatch today stating that the news of the U.S. Republican Party's crushing defeat in the election, upon reaching Taiwan yesterday, immediately "caused undercurrents." The dispatch said that these undercurrents have made Kuomintang figures in Taiwan "worry that the United States will change its policy towards China (referring to the Chiang clique)," so the official newspapers of the Taiwan authorities have almost unanimously written articles emphasizing that the United States will not change its policy, advising everyone "not to worry unnecessarily."

The "Hong Kong Commercial Daily's" editorial believes that the U.S. Republican Party's failure this time is close to "atrocious." The editorial mentioned the U.S.'s future policy towards the Taiwan authorities, which pro-Chiang figures are concerned about, saying, "We should very seriously say that what truly determines China's destiny is ultimately China itself, not the United States." This pro-Chiang newspaper admitted that the United States already regards the Taiwan authorities as a "cumbersome burden." It said: "What is most feared is being at the mercy of others, and then some unfavorable developments in the future may become unavoidable."

The "Sing Tao Daily" published an editorial today entitled "A Statement Casts a Historic Blunder." It believes that the Eisenhower government's staging of Dulles' visit to Taipei and the issuance of a joint communiqué was "very poorly handled, especially forcing the Nationalist government (Chiang Kai-shek's group) to announce the abandonment of using force to counterattack the mainland. This move made people feel that the Eisenhower government was weak towards the CCP." It also said, "As the saying goes, 'Obeying others ultimately harms oneself.' Now the Nationalist government (Chiang Kai-shek's group) is too obedient to the U.S. government. Following their intentions, and the result is like this, speaking of it only increases the pain," "Alas! Alas!"

The "Universal Daily's" commentary believes that the U.S.'s policy towards the Chiang Kai-shek group will not change much in the future, but it also believes that "in the joint communiqué of the Chiang-Dulles talks, a certain degree of change has been shown," and this matter "has already made people suspicious and uneasy."

The "Natural Daily" said that the result of the U.S. Congressional elections "is too painful for us (pro-Chiang elements claiming, hereinafter the same)." It said, "We should admit that there are many people who still have illusions about the United States today, so it is not difficult to understand why they are frustrated by the Republican Party's failure. However, we must shout loudly here that it is the Chinese people who decide the fate of China (referring to the Taiwan authorities). As long as we can face reality and fight strongly, no force can harm us."

The "Current Affairs Column" of this pro-Chiang newspaper today also criticized Eisenhower's remarks after the U.S. Congressional elections, believing that the U.S. President was very "stupid" to "repeatedly quote words that we disagree with in this speech." This newspaper believes that the United States, as an "ally," is doing black market deals behind the back, therefore, Eisenhower's remarks deserve the Taiwan authorities' "vigilance." Because it shows that "the United States seems to have the stupid idea of 'selling out' allies today." And the Taiwan authorities "must never let others manipulate and sell them out."

It said that, standing from the Chiang Kai-shek group's perspective, Eisenhower's remarks "should not only be opposed, but also must be crushed with action."

This pro-Chiang newspaper admitted that the United States is "gradually leading the situation towards the path of 'two Chinas'," and "not only is this idea stupid beyond description, but we Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek's group) as 'allies' must never follow them down the path of stupidity."

    触景伤情　感怀身世
    香港亲蒋报纸惋叹美共和党失败
    大声疾呼劝台湾当局趁早丢掉对美国的幻想
    新华社香港7日电　与台湾方面有关系的香港报纸今天在评论美国国会选举结果时，对共和党惨败所带来的前景表示不安，并且劝告台湾当局不要走上“任人摆布与出卖”的悲惨道路。
    “南中日报”今天发表的台北消息说，美国共和党在选举中惨败的消息在昨日传抵台湾以后，立即
  “引起暗流”。消息说，这种暗流已使台湾国民党人士“忧虑美国将会改变其对华（指蒋集团）政策”，因此台湾当局官方的报纸几乎一致撰文强调美国不会改变政策，劝告大家“不必作杞人之忧”。
    “工商日报”的社论认为，美国共和党这次失败得近于“恶劣”。社论提到亲蒋人士所关心的美国今后对台湾当局政策的时候说，“我们应该很严肃的说，真正决定中国命运的，始终是中国自己而非美国。”这家亲蒋报纸承认美国已经把台湾当局“看成累赘的包袱”。它说：“最怕的是俯仰由人，那今后若干不利的发展，便说不定会无可避免。”
      “星岛日报”今天发表题为“一纸声明铸千古大错”的社论。它认为杜勒斯访问台北和发表会谈公报这一幕，艾森豪威尔政府“搞得很不好，特别是迫使国民政府（蒋介石集团）宣布放弃使用武力反攻大陆。这一着，使人感到艾森豪威尔政府对中共软弱”。它又说，“古语有云：‘顺人终累己’。今国民政府（蒋介石集团）对于美国政府太过顺从了。从了人家意，而结果如斯，言之徒增沉痛”，“悲哉！悲哉！”
      “环球报”的评论认为，美国今后对蒋介石集团的政策将无大改变，但是它同时也认为，“在蒋杜会谈的联合公报中，已显示有某种程度的改变”，而且这事“已经使人疑惧不安”。
    “自然日报”说，美国国会选举的结果“对于我们（亲蒋分子自称，下同）太有切肤之痛”。它说，“我们应该承认，今日对美国存有幻想的人是不少的，所以会因共和党失败而沮丧，亦不难于理解。然而我们却必须在此大声疾呼，决定中国（指台湾当局）命运的是中国人，只要我们能够面对现实，坚强奋斗，没有什么力量可以损害我们。”
    这家亲蒋报纸的“时事专栏”今日还批评了艾森豪威尔在美国会选举后的谈话，认为美国总统“在这次谈话中一再引述我们不同意的话”是十分“愚蠢”的。这家报纸认为作为“盟友”的美国在后门做黑市，因此，艾森豪威尔的谈话值得台湾当局引起“戒心”。因为它表明“美国到了今天，似乎确有进行‘出卖’盟友的愚蠢想法”。而台湾当局“决不能就此任别人摆布与出卖”。
    它说，站在蒋介石集团的立场，对于艾森豪威尔的谈话“不但要表示反对，而且，也一定要以行动来粉碎”。
    这家亲蒋报纸承认美国正在 “使形势逐渐走上‘两个中国’之路”，而“它们这一想法不但愚蠢到无法形容，而作为‘盟友’的我们中国（蒋介石集团）决不能跟着他们走上愚蠢之路”。
