Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 12th – The government of the German Democratic Republic today issued in Berlin a memorandum on the threat to peace posed by the policy of arming West Germany and a white paper on the aggressive policy of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The memorandum emphasized that the threat to peace from West Germany is the result of the re-emergence of power in the hands of monopoly capital and militarists, whose return to power is a violation of the Potsdam Agreement. The memorandum stated: "The current situation in West Germany is characterized by the increasing concentration of economic power in the hands of a small number of monopoly capitalists." In 1958, large companies controlled 62.5% of the share capital, compared to 37.1% in 1938. Large companies with capital of over 100 million marks now control 46% of the total capital, compared to 25.8% in 1938. Seventeen monopoly groups control approximately 80% of West Germany's total share capital. As of March 31, 1956, 181,202 officials and employees in the current government institutions had held similar positions under Hitler. Of the seventeen ministers in the current Federal Government, eight held important positions in the Hitler government, or worked in the SS, SA, or the Nazi Party. There are currently four large veterans' organizations in West Germany, with a total membership of 237,500. There are also 1,172 "old comrades" associations. Two-thirds of the lawyers and judges in the Federal judiciary previously supported the Nazi regime.

The memorandum pointed out the threat to peace and international security posed by the policy of arming West Germany. The memorandum said: The West German government is trying to implement a broad plan of aggression to establish a "Greater Germanic Empire." "The aggressive aims of the West German government are directed not only against the former German territories and the Soviet Union, but also, through more covert diplomacy, against other European countries bordering West Germany." The West German government is no longer satisfied with only receiving atomic weapons from the United States, but also wants to arm the Federal Defense Force with its own manufactured atomic weapons. The West German government is conducting research on atomic weapons. It is making West Germany the center of the threat of atomic war in Europe. The West German government has abolished democratic rights; since 1951, more than two hundred democratic organizations have been declared illegal, and trade unions and social democrats are now under serious threat. There are sixty-two espionage agencies in West Berlin, mainly West German and American. There are a total of three hundred and thirty-nine such agencies in West Germany.

The memorandum concluded by pointing out that the West German government opposes every attempt to ease international tensions and is an enemy of national liberation movements. The memorandum said: "The West German government supports Portugal on the Goa issue, the imperialist countries during the Suez Canal crisis, and Israel's anti-Arab policies. During the Anglo-American aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, American troops were dispatched from West German airports." The West German government loans money to France to finance the Algerian war, and even pays occupation fees to French troops stationed in Algeria, rather than in West Germany.

    民主德国政府发表备忘录和白皮书
    西德重新武装威胁国际和平
    军国主义分子重掌政权违背波茨坦协定
    新华社柏林12日电　德意志民主共和国政府今天在柏林发表了关于武装西德的政策造成对和平的威胁的备忘录和关于德意志联邦共和国政府的侵略政策的白皮书。
    备忘录强调指出，来自西德的对和平的威胁，是垄断资本和军国主义分子重新掌握政权的结果，他们重掌政权是违背波茨坦协定的。备忘录说：“目前西德局势的特点是：经济权力越来越集中于一小撮垄断资本家手中。”在1958年，大公司控制62.5％股份资本，而在1938年则为37.1％。有一亿马克以上资本的大公司现在控制着全部资本的46％，而在1938年则为25.8％。十七个垄断集团控制着西德全部股份资本的80％左右。到1956年3月31日，在目前政府机构中，有十八万一千二百零二名官员和雇员曾经在希特勒手下担任过同样的职务。在目前联邦政府的十七个部长中，有八人曾在希特勒政府中担任过重要的职务，或在党卫军、突击队或纳粹党中担任工作。目前西德有四个大的退伍军人组织，共有会员二十三万七千五百人。另外还有一千一百七十二个“老同志”联合会。联邦司法部门中的三分之二的律师和法官是以前支持过纳粹政权的人。
    备忘录指出了武装西德的政策对和平和国际安全的威胁。备忘录说：西德政府力图执行一个广泛的侵略计划，以建立“大日耳曼帝国”。“西德政府的侵略目的不仅针对前德国的领土和苏联，并且还通过更秘密的外交针对同西德接壤的其他欧洲国家。”西德政府不再满足于只从美国接受原子武器，还想用自己制造的原子武器来武装联邦国防军。西德政府正在进行原子武器的研究工作。它把西德成为欧洲原子战争威胁的中心。西德政府废除了民主权利，自从1951年以来，两百多个民主组织被宣布非法，工会和社会民主党现在受到严重的威胁。在西柏林有六十二个特务机构，主要是西德和美国的特务机构。在西德共有三百三十九个这样的机构。
    备忘录在最后指出，西德政府反对每一个缓和国际紧张局势的尝试，它是民族解放运动的敌人。备忘录说：“西德政府在果阿问题上支持葡萄牙，在苏伊士运河危机中支持帝国主义国家，支持以色列的反阿拉伯的政策。在英美侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的期间，美国军队就是从西德机场派去的。”西德政府贷款给法国，作为阿尔及利亚战争的经费，甚至付给法国并不驻在西德而是驻在阿尔及利亚的军队以占领费。
