Flowers of Friendship Bloom, a Son Arrives
	Guo Rui, Baotou First Hospital

	In the outer room of the obstetrics ward, a Soviet expert paced back and forth excitedly and anxiously, sometimes stopping to listen intently. Suddenly, a loud baby's cry came from the delivery room. A young doctor then came out, beaming, and announced to everyone: The expert's wife has given birth to a boy! The expert immediately rushed over to shake hands with the doctor. Many people gathered around to congratulate him. At this moment, tears welled up in the expert's eyes, and he simply said, "Thank you all, I am so happy!"

	Mrs. Bereleva is thirty-eight years old this year. She has been married for over ten years and has never had a child, but how much she wanted one! She had undergone many treatments in the past, but the wish to have a child was never fulfilled. When the Bereleva couple came to China to help build Baotou Steel, they heard that traditional Chinese medicine was very experienced and effective in "promoting conception," so they consulted a doctor. After the doctor's painstaking treatment, Mrs. Bereleva indeed became pregnant quickly. However, for some reason, Mrs. Bereleva developed some adverse reactions about forty days after pregnancy: continuous bleeding from the uterus. Based on her medical history, people considered whether this was a disease or a true pregnancy? Another young doctor, Dr. Jiang, carefully diagnosed her and calmly diagnosed it as a pregnancy, and carried out a series of medical measures such as fetal protection. After various treatments, the fetus was finally prevented from miscarrying.

	On a sunny day, the Bereleva couple took their son home from the hospital. The expert expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the doctors, saying, "We bring Soviet friendship to the Chinese people, but China brings us unparalleled happiness!" Mrs. Bereleva said excitedly while holding the child, "This is the most precious gift I will bring back to my mother in Moscow from China! I believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the developed Chinese medicine is the most advanced in the world." (Attached picture)

    友谊花开儿子来
    包头市第一医院　郭瑞
    产科病房的外室，有一位苏联专家兴奋而又焦急地不时来回走动着，有时又停下来侧耳细听。突然，一阵洪亮的婴儿哭声，从临产室里传出来，接着走出来一个年青的大夫，满面笑容地向大家报告：专家夫人顺利地生下了一个男孩子！专家马上跑过去和大夫握手。在座的许多人都一拥上来向他祝贺。专家这时眼睛里闪着泪花，只是说：“谢谢大家，我太幸福了！”
    别列也娃夫人今年三十八岁了，结婚已有十多年，没有生过孩子，可是她多么想要一个孩子啊！过去曾经很多诊治，但获得孩子的愿望总是没能实现。别列也娃夫妇来到我国帮助建设包钢时，听说中医对于“坐胎”很有经验和疗效，就去请教了一位大夫。经过大夫苦心诊治，别列也娃夫人果真很快地怀孕了。但不知什么原因，别列也娃夫人在孕后大约四十多天就产生了些不良的反应：子宫内出血不止。人们根据她的病史来考虑，这究竟是病呢，还是真的妊娠了呢？另一位年青的蒋大夫细心地诊治后沉着地诊断为妊娠，进行了保胎等一系列的医疗措施。经过多方面的救治，终于没让胎儿流掉。
    在一个晴朗的日子里，别列也娃夫妇抱着他们的儿子出院了。专家向医生们表示了万分的感谢，说：“我们给中国人民带来苏联的友谊，可是在中国却给我们带来无比的幸福！”别列也娃夫人抱着孩子激动地说：“这是从中国给我在莫斯科的妈妈带回去的最高贵的礼物！我相信在中国共产党领导下和发扬了的中国医学是世界上最先进的。”（附图片）
