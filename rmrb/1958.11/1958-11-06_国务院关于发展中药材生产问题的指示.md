Since the nationwide liberation, the production of Chinese medicinal materials has greatly developed, with total output increasing year by year, basically meeting the needs of the broad masses of people. However, recently, in the midst of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, some regions, while focusing on the production of major crops such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds, have not been able to give due consideration to the labor force necessary for cultivating and collecting Chinese medicinal materials, resulting in a decline in the production of some Chinese medicinal materials. In addition, the procurement work has not been tightly grasped. In the first half of this year, the national medicinal material procurement only completed one-third of the annual plan, a decrease of one-fourth compared to the same period last year. As a result, the supply of certain Chinese medicinal materials has become strained. For example, strychnos nux-vomica used for eliminating pests, Aucklandia lappa, betel nut, and safflower used for eliminating schistosomiasis, and cinnabar and peppermint used for epidemic prevention and plague avoidance, and musk used for treating Japanese encephalitis and syphilis cannot meet the needs. The supply of some varieties is far from meeting the needs. With the comprehensive and in-depth development of the Patriotic Health Campaign and the further improvement of people's lives, the broad masses of people have a more urgent demand for the prevention and treatment of diseases, and the demand for Chinese medicinal materials has greatly increased. Therefore, people's committees at all levels must pay sufficient attention to the production and supply of Chinese medicinal materials, fully mobilize and rely on the strength of the masses, develop the production of Chinese medicinal materials, and improve procurement work, so as to achieve full production and full supply, in order to rapidly change the situation of supply falling short of demand for Chinese medicinal materials.

In order to do a good job in developing the production of Chinese medicinal materials, the following instructions are hereby issued:

I. Implementing the principle of local production and local supply is the fundamental way to develop the production of Chinese medicinal materials and solve the problem of the supply of Chinese medicinal materials.

In recent years, the production of Chinese medicinal materials has been very unstable. On the one hand, it is because most Chinese medicinal materials are wild plants, which are easily subject to natural disasters and cannot be included in the production plans of agricultural cooperatives, so production is not guaranteed. On the other hand, the production areas of Chinese medicinal materials are now too concentrated, so a poor harvest in one place often affects the supply nationwide. Implementing the method of local production and local supply can build the source of medicinal materials on a reliable basis, and can improve business management, reduce transportation and storage costs, and reduce commodity losses.

To implement the principle of local production and local supply, it is necessary to break the superstitious ideas that "authentic medicinal materials" cannot be introduced and cultivated in other places and that non-"authentic medicinal materials" are not prescribed or managed. In recent years, various places have had many successful experiences in introducing varieties from other regions. For example, ginseng introduced in Shanxi, and Rehmannia glutinosa introduced in Sichuan, Hubei, Hebei, Anhui, and other provinces, have all been successfully trial-planted. Rehmannia glutinosa introduced in Hubei Province this year has been able to meet the needs of the province. These experiences are worth serious promotion. Various places should appraise the quality of these introduced medicinal materials. All medicinal materials with medical value should be used. In order to ensure efficacy, local doctors should be invited to study and, when prescribing, use the appropriate amount according to the performance and quality of the medicinal materials. As for "authentic medicinal materials," when introduced to other places, due to differences in soil, climate, and the masses' planting and processing techniques, there needs to be a certain experimental stage in order to make the introduced medicinal materials have better medical effects. Moreover, after testing, it is still possible that some regions will not be able to introduce certain medicinal material varieties. Therefore, the original production bases of "authentic medicinal materials" must undertake the task of regulating supply between domestic regions. At the same time, it must also meet the needs of export. Therefore, implementing this principle of local production and local supply is by no means intended to weaken the production of "authentic medicinal materials," but must be protected and developed in a planned manner.

In order to realize the above-mentioned principle, the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government must formulate specific plans for developing the production of Chinese medicinal materials in their respective regions in the short term. When introducing varieties from other regions, because soil and climate have an impact on the quality of Chinese medicinal materials, they must be tested before being gradually promoted, and efforts must be made to achieve self-sufficiency quickly. In order to ensure the implementation of the plan, some on-site conferences on the production and processing of Chinese medicinal materials should be convened throughout the country. This work will be specifically arranged by the Fifth Office of the State Council in consultation with relevant departments. After the implementation of the principle of local production and local supply, the production and sales of Chinese medicinal materials will undergo great changes. The relevant departments of the Central Government and the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government must strengthen the comprehensive balance of the production and sales of Chinese medicinal materials.

II. Actively and systematically transforming wild animal and plant medicinal materials into domestic breeding and cultivation is another fundamental measure to develop the production of Chinese medicinal materials and solve the problem of the supply of Chinese medicinal materials.

More than 80% of Chinese medicinal materials are wild animals and plants. For example, among the 487 commonly used plant medicinal materials, there are 392 wild medicinal materials. When not included in a specific plan, the production of wild medicinal materials in various places is not easy to stabilize, and the work of collecting and capturing is not easy to guarantee. Moreover, in the movements of closing mountains for afforestation, soil and water conservation, reclaiming wasteland, intensive cultivation, eliminating boundary lines, and eliminating diseases and insect pests, if the production and collection of wild medicinal materials are not included in the plan, a certain impact will occur. Therefore, in order to meet the people's medical needs, it is necessary to protect and develop wild animal and plant medicinal materials with medical value, and gradually transform wild into domestic breeding and cultivation according to possible conditions. Only domestic breeding and cultivation can carry out production in a planned manner, and can adopt scientific breeding and management methods to increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs. In recent years, various places have made many achievements in the trial breeding and trial planting of wild animal and plant medicinal materials. For example, the wild medicinal materials trial-planted in 11 provinces, including Sichuan, Guizhou, and Jilin, have reached more than 150 varieties; the trial breeding of scorpions, bungarus multicinctus, toads, eupolyphaga sinensis, deer, etc. in provinces such as Henan, Shandong, Guangdong, Liaoning, Zhejiang, and Hubei have also been successful. Facts have proved that it is entirely possible to transform wild into domestic breeding and cultivation.

Transforming wild medicinal materials into domestic breeding and cultivation should mainly rely on communes. It is necessary to advocate "each commune tries to breed, each commune tries to plant," and mobilize everyone to try breeding and planting. The local plant cultivation farms and Chinese medicinal material management departments should, under the unified leadership of the local party committee, provide assistance to the commune's domestic breeding and cultivation work; at the same time, for some important varieties, they should also build their own farms for trial breeding and trial planting. This work should first be carried out in the original producing areas for breeding and cultivation, and then promoted after experience is gained. In the trial breeding, trial planting and promotion, if some units have financial difficulties, when necessary, commercial departments can use prepayment of goods or take other appropriate measures to assist them.

Since there will be a process for transforming wild medicinal materials into domestic breeding and cultivation, and it is also impossible to completely transform all wild animal and plant medicinal materials into domestic breeding and cultivation, various places must pay attention to the protection and collection of wild medicinal materials while strengthening domestic breeding and cultivation work. Otherwise, it will inevitably bring great difficulties to the supply work in the future. To this end, various places should make overall arrangements for the work of collecting medicine and closing mountains for afforestation, soil and water conservation, etc., and properly solve the labor force needed for collecting medicine, so that collecting medicine can be closely combined with agricultural and sideline production.

III. While arranging the production of Chinese medicinal materials, people's committees at all levels must also strengthen their leadership over the management of Chinese medicinal materials.

The management of Chinese medicinal materials is very complicated, has a wide range of contacts, and also relates to the issue of sorting out, inheriting, and promoting the Chinese national medical and health cultural heritage. The people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government should conscientiously strengthen their leadership over the management of Chinese medicinal materials, so that the management of Chinese medicinal materials can meet the needs of people's health.

In 1957, the State Council decided that the management of Chinese medicinal materials should be under the unified leadership of the health department. According to the experience of the past year, the management of Chinese medicinal materials under the unified leadership of the health department not only closely combines medicine and health, but also facilitates the overall arrangement of the medical and health work of the people's commune in the current new situation of the Great Leap Forward; at the same time, it is also of great significance for banning counterfeit and shoddy drugs, improving drug quality, and ensuring people's health. Therefore, the management of Chinese medicinal materials should still be led by the health department.

At present, when making comprehensive arrangements for steel production and autumn harvesting, autumn storage, autumn plowing, autumn planting, and the procurement and allocation of agricultural products, the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government should include the procurement and allocation of Chinese medicinal materials as one of the comprehensively arranged items, in order to complete the procurement and allocation tasks of Chinese medicinal materials, ensure the timely supply of Chinese medicinal materials, and meet the people's medical needs.

    国务院关于发展中药材生产问题的指示
    全国解放以来，中药材生产有很大的发展，总产量逐年增加，基本上满足了广大人民的需要。但是，最近以来，在工农业生产大跃进当中，有些地区在抓粮食、棉花、油料等主要农作物生产的同时，对于培植和采集中药材所必需的劳动力，还来不及给予应有的照顾，致使部分中药材生产下降。加以收购工作抓得不紧，今年上半年全国药材收购只完成了年计划的三分之一，比去年同期还下降了四分之一。这样，就使得某些中药材的供应出现了紧张的情况，如除四害用的马前子，消灭血吸虫病用的木香、槟榔、红花，防疫避瘟用的朱砂、薄荷，治疗乙型脑炎和梅毒用的麝香等都不能满足需要，有的品种距离满足需要还很远。随着爱国卫生运动全面深入地开展和人民生活进一步地改善，广大人民对于预防和治疗疾病的要求更加迫切，对于中药材的需要量大大增加。因此，各级人民委员会对于中药材的生产和供应工作，必须引起足够的重视，必须充分发动和依靠群众力量，发展中药材生产，改进收购工作，作到充分生产，充分供应，以便迅速地改变中药材供不应求的状况。
    为了作好发展中药材生产的工作，现作如下指示：
    一、实行就地生产、就地供应的方针，是发展中药材生产解决中药材供应问题的根本办法。
    几年以来，中药材生产很不稳定，一方面是由于中药材多属于野生植物，既容易遭受自然灾害，又不能列入农业社的生产规划，因而生产没有保证；另一方面，现在中药材生产地区过于集中，所以往往一地歉收就影响全国的供应。实行就地生产、就地供应的办法，就可以使药源建筑在可靠的基础上，并且可以改善经营管理，降低运输和保管费用，减少商品损耗。
    实行就地生产、就地供应的方针，必须打破“地道药材”不能易地引种和非“地道药材”不处方、不经营的迷信思想。最近几年以来，各地在引种外区品种方面已经有不少成功的事实。如山西引种的人参，四川、湖北、河北、安徽等省引种的生地，都已经试种成功。湖北省今年引种的生地，就已经能够满足本省的需要。这些经验都是值得认真推广的。对于这部分引种的药材，各地应当对其质量，进行鉴定，凡是有医疗价值的药材，都要使用。为了保证疗效，还应当请当地医生研究，在处方时，根据药材的性能和质量，对其分量多寡，斟酌使用。至于“地道药材”在易地引种的时候，由于各地土壤、气候和群众对药材的种植、加工技术等条件不同，需要有一定的试验阶段，才能使引种的药材具有比较好的医疗效果，而且经过试验以后，也还可能有一些地区对于某些药材品种仍然不能引种。因此，原有的“地道药材”生产基地必须担负国内地区之间的调剂任务，同时，它还要供应出口的需要，所以实行这种就地生产、就地供应的方针，决不是要削弱“地道药材”的生产，而是必须加以保护和有计划地发展。
    为了实现上述方针，各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会必须在短期内作出发展本地区中药材生产的具体规划。各地在引种外区品种的时候，由于土壤、气候对中药材的品质有影响，必须经过试验以后，再逐步推广，并且争取很快地达到自给。为了保证规划的实现，应当在全国各地召集一些中药材生产和加工的现场会议，这项工作，由国务院第五办公室商同有关部门具体安排。在实行就地生产、就地供应的方针以后，中药材的产销情况将会发生很大变化。中央各有关部门和各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会必须加强对中药材产销的综合平衡工作。
    二、积极地有步骤地变野生动、植物药材为家养家种，是发展中药材生产和解决中药材供应问题的另一项带有根本性的措施。
    中药材有80％以上是野生动、植物。如常用的四百八十七种植物药材中，就有野生药材三百九十二种。在没有纳入具体规划的时候，各地的野生药材生产就不易稳定，采集和捕捉的工作也不易得到保证。而且在封山育林、水土保持、开垦荒地、精耕细作、取消地界、消灭病虫害等运动中，如果不将野生药材的生产和采集也纳入规划，当会发生一定的影响。因此，为了满足人民的医疗需要，必须保护和发展有医疗价值的野生动、植物药材，并且根据可能条件逐步地变野生为家养家种。只有家养家种，才能够有计划地进行生产，才能够采用科学的饲养和管理方法增加生产、提高质量和降低成本。几年以来，各地在试养试种野生动、植物药材方面已经取得了不少成就。如四川、贵州、吉林等十一个省试种的野生药材已达一百五十余种；河南、山东、广东、辽宁、浙江、湖北等省试养的全蝎、白花蛇、蛤蟆、土元、獐子等也已成功。事实证明，变野生为家养家种是完全可能的。
    变野生药材为家养家种，应当主要依靠公社来进行。要提倡“社社试养，社社试种”，发动大家都来试养试种。各地植物栽培场和中药材经营部门，应当在当地党委的统一领导下，对于公社的家养家种工作给予协助；同时，对于一部分重要的品种，也应当自行建场试养试种。这项工作，应当首先在原产区进行饲养和栽培，待取得经验以后，再行推广。在试养试种和推广中，有些单位如果资金困难，必要的时候，可以采用商业部门预付货款或者采取其他适当的办法加以扶助。
    由于野生药材变家养家种要有一个过程，而且也不可能将所有的野生动、植物药材完全变为家养家种，所以各地在加强家养家种工作的同时，还必须注意野生药材的保护和采集工作。否则，必然会给今后的供应工作带来很大的困难。为此，各地对于采药和封山育林、水土保持等项工作，应当统筹安排，对于采药所需要的劳动力也应作妥善的解决，以便使采药与农副业生产密切结合起来。
    三、在安排中药材生产的同时，各级人民委员会还必须加强对中药材经营工作的领导。
    中药材的经营工作很复杂，联系面很广，同时也关系到整理、继承、发扬祖国医药文化遗产的问题。各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会应当认真加强对中药材经营工作的领导，使中药材的经营工作能够适应人民健康的需要。
    中药材经营机构，国务院在1957年已经决定交由卫生部门统一领导。根据一年来的经验，中药材经营机构交由卫生部门统一领导，不仅密切了医药结合，而且在当前大跃进的新形势下也便于人民公社医药卫生工作的统筹安排；同时，对于取缔伪劣药品，提高药品质量，保证人民健康也有重大意义。因此，中药材的经营机构仍应由卫生部门领导。
    目前，各地在全面安排钢铁生产和秋收、秋藏、秋耕、秋种以及农产品收购、调运等项工作的时候，各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会应当把中药材的收购和调运工作作为全面安排的项目之一，以便完成中药材的收购和调运任务，保证中药材的及时供应，满足人民的医疗需要。
