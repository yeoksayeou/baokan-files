    This Year's Bumper Harvest in the Soviet Union
    By Matskevich, Minister of Agriculture of the Soviet Union
    The harvesting work of collective farms and state farms in the Soviet Union is nearing completion. Although it is not yet possible to make a final summary, it can already be predicted that this year's harvest of grain and other crops will exceed any previous year.
    This achievement in the development of agriculture is the result of the Party and government's comprehensive organizational work to consolidate the collective farm system. Since the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the Communist Party has implemented a series of huge organizational and economic measures to launch a high tide in agricultural production.
    The material and technical foundation of agriculture has been strengthened. From 1954 to 1957, the Soviet state invested a total of 75.45 billion rubles in agriculture for the construction of production buildings and for the payment of tractors, automobiles, and machinery equipment, which is 10 billion rubles more than the total investment for the same purpose during the Second, Third, Fourth, and the first three years of the Fifth Five-Year Plans. Collective farms and state farms have been strengthened by experienced leading cadres. If on July 1, 1953, there were 83,000 professionals with higher and secondary professional education in collective farms and machine tractor stations, by the end of 1957, this number had reached 278,000. The material interests of collective farmers and state farm workers in increasing agricultural production have also been improved. The implementation of the new planning system has given collective farms greater initiative in planning and organizing the public economy. Collective farms now have the right to supplement and amend individual clauses of the agricultural labor association charter based on the specific local conditions of their farms.
    In recent years, the merged collective farms, with the strong help of the state, have become multi-sectoral farms with a large number of skilled cadres, stronger economies, and good mechanical equipment. The income of collective farms has increased, and the material welfare of the members has also improved. In this case, it is possible to implement important measures such as selling machinery and equipment to collective farms. The Communist Party's formulated methods on further developing the collective farm system and reforming machine tractor stations, on abolishing compulsory sales and abolishing in-kind payments for work done by machine tractor stations, and on the new system, prices, and conditions for purchasing agricultural products, have opened up broader avenues for collective farms to actively implement various measures on expanding agricultural production and better organizing this production. At the same time, the concentration of machinery and equipment in the hands of collective farms has also increased the responsibility of collective farm leaders to correctly and more fully utilize land, machinery, tractors, and labor.
    This year's experience has confirmed the correctness of the decisions of the Communist Party and the Soviet government on further developing agriculture. The efficiency of the machines purchased by collective farms has been greatly improved compared with machine tractor stations. The time for field work has been shortened. Compared with the past few years, the workload of tractors and agricultural machinery per shift and per day has greatly increased. The quality of work is consistently excellent; field management has also been better organized. All this has promoted the increase in yield per unit area of grain and other crops.
    This year's total sown area of all crops is 196 million hectares, an increase of 38 million hectares compared with 1953. The sown area of wheat, the most important food crop, is 18 million hectares more than in 1953, while the sown area of the high-yielding grain and feed crop corn is 16 million hectares more, or five times that of 1953.
    As everyone knows, such a large increase in sown area is due to the reclamation of virgin and fallow land in our eastern regions: Siberia, Kazakhstan, the Urals, and the Volga River basin. Now these areas have become our largest granary. The production of the main commercial grains, especially wheat, is concentrated here.
    The expansion of the grain base in the eastern regions has made it possible for us to engage in planned agricultural production and to further specialize production in other regions, that is, to produce products that are more economical and more beneficial to them. This enables us to greatly improve the regional allocation of agricultural production. For example, in Ukraine and the North Caucasus, the sown area of beets and feed crops has greatly increased. In the North Caucasus, Crimea, and Moldova, the land for orchards and vineyards has also rapidly expanded. In Belarus, the Baltic republics, the Central Non-Black Earth Zone, and the northwestern states, various farms have specialized in producing long-fiber flax, potatoes, milk, and meat. In the Central Asian and South Caucasus republics, cotton production is being expanded.
    This year, agricultural workers in the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and the Ukrainian Republic have achieved outstanding results in striving for a bumper grain harvest. The most important grain regions of the Russian Federation: the North Caucasus, the Volga River basin, and the states of the Central Black Earth Zone have completed and overfulfilled their original production plans and their obligations to sell grain to the state ahead of schedule. Bumper harvests of grain crops have also been achieved in Siberia and Kazakhstan.
    This year, the work of selling grain to the state is also more organized than in previous years. Before October 10, the collective farms and state farms across the country sold 1.487 billion poods of grain more to the state than in the same period in 1953, or 86% more. The sale of grain is still continuing. Many collective farms and state farms in Siberia and Kazakhstan still have a lot of grain that has been harvested but not yet threshed. They will be able to sell several hundred million more poods of grain to the state. Therefore, it can be said that rural workers have achieved great results in striving to expand grain production this year.
    Intense work to establish a solid feed base for animal husbandry is always underway. Collective farmers, workers and staff of state farms, and agricultural technicians clearly understand that to catch up with and surpass the United States in the output of meat, milk, and fats per capita, it is necessary to first have sufficient production of various feeds, including roughage, succulent feed, and concentrated feed.
    This year, many farms have used the large harvests of pasture grass, corn, and other feed crops to store succulent feed and roughage for one and a half to two years. Many states, border areas, and republics have achieved bumper harvests of corn, with an average yield of 300 to 400 quintals of stalks and corncobs per hectare, and in advanced collective farms, state farms, and districts, yields of 700 to 800 quintals or more per hectare can even be achieved.
    Equipping collective farms and state farms with the latest machinery and equipment, coupled with the improvement of the skills of machine operators, has greatly reduced the labor expenditure in planting corn. In the past two or three years, sufficient experience has been accumulated in this regard, and great practical results have been achieved.
    The bumper corn harvest achieved by many collective farms and state farms this year has made it possible to greatly increase the preparation of silage. In 1953, collective farms and state farms stored a total of 32 million tons of silage, while before October 10 this year, 140 million tons of silage had been stored, of which 101 million tons was corn silage. In addition, some farms have collected more than 2.5 million tons of corn cobs in the milky-wax and wax ripeness stages and ensiled them as feed. Such storage of succulent feed in collective farms and state farms has never happened before. This year, the reserves of roughage such as hay and wheat straw are also more than in previous years. This ensures that almost all regions can guarantee sufficient feed for publicly owned livestock to get through the winter.
    In recent years, significant achievements have been made in increasing sugar beet production and sugar beet processing. In 1953, the total output of sugar was 3.4 million tons, and in 1957 it reached 4.5 million tons. This year's yield per hectare and the total harvest of sugar beets will greatly exceed those of previous years. In the drylands of collective farms and state farms in Rovno Oblast, 289 quintals of sugar beets were harvested per hectare, and in the irrigated land of collective farms and state farms in the Kyrgyz Republic, 358 quintals of sugar beets were harvested per hectare. According to preliminary data, this year's total sugar beet harvest will be close to 500 million quintals, which is double that of 1953. The increase in sugar production is also in the same proportion.
    Sunflower is our country's main oil crop. Soviet scientists have created sunflower varieties with extremely high oil content. The superior sunflower varieties cultivated by Pustovoit, Hero of Socialist Labor and Academician of the Academy of Sciences, have an oil yield of over 50%. In the main sunflower-growing regions of the country, this crop has achieved a bumper harvest. For example, in the Krasnodar Territory, the average yield of sunflowers per hectare exceeds 18 quintals, and on an area of 66,000 hectares, the yield per hectare is as high as 20 to 25 quintals.
    Long-fiber flax has also had a bumper harvest this year. After overcoming many difficulties, the collective farm members of the republics of Central Asia and the South Caucasus have also achieved a bumper harvest of cotton. The harvest of vegetables has also exceeded that of previous years.
    Collective farm men and women, workers of state farms and machine repair stations, and Party and Soviet organizations are now focusing their efforts on striving to complete the harvesting work as quickly as possible and to complete the plan for selling agricultural products to the state.
    On the basis of expanding grain production and strengthening the feed base, great achievements have been made in developing publicly owned livestock and increasing their productivity in recent years. At the beginning of 1958, the number of cattle in the country was 10.9 million more than in 1953, the number of pigs increased by 11 million, and the number of sheep increased by 20 million.
    As everyone knows, the January 1955 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee proposed the task of increasing the average annual milk yield per cow to at least 1,700 kg within six years. This task was overfulfilled in 1957, that is, it was completed in three years. In 1957, the average milk yield per cow was 1,858 kg.
    The public animal husbandry of collective farms and state farms now occupies a major position in the production of commercial livestock products. Therefore, it has been possible to exempt collective farmers, workers, and staff from the burden of compulsory sales of milk, meat, wool, and other agricultural products. This year, the number of livestock will continue to grow. From October 1, 1957, to October 1, 1958, the number of cattle in collective farms and state farms increased by 3.5 million, or 9%. Among them, the number of dairy cows increased by 800,000. The number of pigs increased by 1.4 million, or 4%; the number of sheep and goats increased by 6.4 million, or 4%. The total milk production of collective farms and state farms in the first nine months of this year increased by 7% compared with the same period last year.
    The entire Soviet people are paying attention to the achievements of agricultural workers with great satisfaction. The increase in agricultural production is of vital interest to every citizen of the Soviet Union. In fact, under the conditions in our country, the increase in agricultural production means a corresponding increase in the consumption of agricultural products. At the same time, this increase in consumption is universal and applies to all residents and all ethnic groups without exception. However, in capitalist countries, the increase in agricultural production does not necessarily lead to a simultaneous increase in consumption. Whether it is an increase or decrease in grain production, the millions of unemployed people in capitalist countries—the constant reserve army of labor—dare not dream of raising their consumption levels at all. Behind the average figures published in these countries lies a huge gap between grain production and consumption, a huge disparity in the nutritional levels of the propertied classes and the working people, and a huge difference in the diets of the residents of the metropolitan countries and the people of the colonies.
    While completing the work of this agricultural year, Soviet farmers are preparing to greet the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with a greater high tide. They are prepared to achieve new and more brilliant achievements in expanding agricultural production in the coming year of 1959: not only to give the state more agricultural products, but also high-quality and inexpensive products. In this way, the people's needs for food and the industry's needs for agricultural raw materials will be more fully met. (Attached image)

    苏联今年的大丰收
    苏联农业部长  马茨凯维奇
    苏联集体农庄和国营农场的收获工作即将结束。虽然现在还不能作最后总结，但是已经可以预言，今年谷物和其他农作物的收获量将超过以往的任何一年。
    在发展农业方面取得的这一成绩，乃是党和政府巩固集体农庄制度的全面组织工作的成果。自从1953年苏共中央九月全会以后，近五年来，共产党已实施了一系列为掀起农业生产高潮的巨大组织和经济措施。
    农业的物质技术基础加强了。从1954年到1957年，在农业方面苏维埃国家用于建设生产用的建筑物、用于支付拖拉机、汽车和机器设备的投资共达七百五十四亿五千万卢布，也就是说比第二、第三、第四三个五年计划再加上第五个五年计划头三年用于同样目的的投资总和还多一百亿卢布。各集体农庄和国营农场由于得到有经验的领导干部而加强了。如果说1953年7月1日在各集体农庄和机器拖拉机站有八万三千名专业人员受过高等和中等专业教育，那么在1957年底这样的人员已达二十七万八千人。集体农庄农民和国营农场工作人员从物质利益上对农产品增产的关怀也提高了。新的计划制度的实行，使集体农庄在计划和组织公有经济方面发挥了更大的主动性。各集体农庄已有权根据本农庄的当地具体条件来补充和修改农业劳动组合章程的个别条款。
    近几年来，各个合并后的集体农庄在国家的大力帮助下已成为拥有大量熟练干部、经济上更强大、机械设备良好的多部门的农庄。集体农庄的收入增加了，庄员的物质福利也提高了。在这种情况下，就能够实现像把机器设备出售给集体农庄这样的重要措施。共产党制订的关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站、关于取消义务交售和取消以实物偿付机器拖拉机站代做的工作、关于采购农产品的新制度、价格和条件等办法，为各集体农庄主动地执行关于扩大农业生产和更好地组织这些生产的各项措施，打开了更广阔的场所。同时，机器设备集中在集体农庄手中，也提高了集体农庄领导干部正确地和更充分地利用土地、机器拖拉机和劳动力的责任感。
    今年的经验已经证实了共产党和苏联政府关于进一步发展农业的决议的正确性。集体农庄所买的机器在使用效率方面和机器拖拉机站相比，已大大有所改进。农田工作的时间缩短了。同过去几年相比，拖拉机和农业机器每班和每昼夜的工作量都大大提高了。工作质量照例是优良的；田间管理工作也组织得更好了。所有这一切都促进了谷物和其他农作物的单位面积产量的提高。
    今年全部农作物的播种总面积是一亿九千六百万公顷，同1953年相比，增加了三千八百万公顷。最主要的粮食作物小麦的播种面积比1953年多一千八百万公顷，而高产的谷物和饲料作物玉蜀黍的播种面积则多一千六百万公顷，或者说为1953年的五倍。
    大家知道，播种面积能这样大大的增加是由于在我国东部地区：西伯利亚、哈萨克斯坦、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域开垦了生荒地和熟荒地的结果。现在这些地区已变成我国最大的谷仓。这里集中了主要的商品谷物特别是小麦的生产。
    东部地区谷物基地的扩大使我们有可能从事有计划的农产品生产，使其他地区的生产更加专业化，即生产对它们更经济、更有利的产品。这就使我们能够大大改善农业生产的地区配置。例如在乌克兰和北高加索，甜菜和饲料作物的播种面积大大增加了。在北高加索、克里米亚和摩尔达维亚，果园和葡萄园的用地也迅速扩大了。在白俄罗斯、在波罗的海沿岸各共和国、在中央非黑土带和西北各州，各个农庄已专门从事生产长纤维亚麻、马铃薯、牛奶和肉类。在中亚细亚和南加索各共和国，正在扩大棉花的生产。
    今年俄罗斯联邦、哈萨克斯坦和乌克兰共和国的农业劳动者在争取谷物丰收方面取得了杰出的成绩。俄罗斯联邦最重要的谷物区：北高加索、伏尔加河流域、中央黑土带各州都提前和超额完成了原订生产计划和它们向国家交售谷物的义务。西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦的谷类作物也取得了丰收。
    今年向国家出售谷物的工作也比往年进行得更有组织。10月10日前全国各集体农庄和国营农场卖给国家的谷物要比1953年同时期多十四亿八千七百万普特谷物，或者说多86％。谷物的交售还在继续。西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦各集体农庄和国营农场中还有很多已收割但尚未经打晒的谷物。它们将能够再卖给国家几亿普特的谷物。因此可以说，农村劳动者在今年争取扩大谷物产量方面已经取得了巨大的成绩。
    为畜牧业建立稳固的饲料基地的紧张工作是一直在进行着的。集体农庄的农民，国营农场的工人和工作人员以及农业技术人员都清楚地懂得，要在按人口计算的肉类、牛奶和油脂的产量方面赶上并超过美国，就必须首先具备足够的各种饲料生产，其中包括粗饲料、多汁饲料和精饲料。
    今年，许多农场已经利用大量收获的牧草、玉蜀黍和其他饲料作物，以贮存一年半到两年的多汁饲料和粗饲料。许多州、边疆区和共和国的玉蜀黍都获得丰收，平均每公顷收了三百公担到四百公担的茎秆和玉米棒，而在先进的集体农庄、国营农场和区里，每公顷甚至能收七百到八百公担以上。
    用最新式的机器设备来装备集体农庄和国营农场，再加上机器操使人员技术的增进，使得在种植玉蜀黍方面大大减轻了劳动力的耗费。最近两三年来在这方面已经积累了足够的经验并已取得了很大的实际效果。
    今年许多集体农庄和国营农场取得的玉蜀黍丰收，使得有可能大大增加青贮饲料的准备。1953年各集体农庄和国营农场共贮存了三千二百万吨青贮饲料，而今年10月10日以前已经贮存了一亿四千万吨青贮饲料，其中玉蜀黍青贮饲料为一亿零一百万吨。此外，一些农场还收集了二百五十万吨以上呈乳蜡熟状和蜡熟状的玉米棒，把它们作为饲料青贮起来。在各集体农庄和国营农场中这样储存多汁饲料，还是从来没有的。今年对粗饲料如干草和麦秆的储备也比前几年多。这样就使几乎所有地区都能保证公有牲畜有足够过冬的饲料。
    近几年来，在甜菜增产和甜菜加工方面已获得重大成绩。1953年砂糖的总产量是三百四十万吨，1957年已达四百五十万吨。今年每公顷甜菜产量和甜菜的总收获量将大大超过前几年。在罗汶斯克州的集体农庄和国营农场的旱地上，每公顷收了二百八十九公担甜菜，在吉尔吉斯共和国各集体农庄和国营农场经过灌溉的土地上，从每公顷收了三百五十八公担甜菜。根据初步材料，今年甜菜的总收获量将近五亿公担，要比1953年高出一倍。糖的增产比例也是如此。
    向日葵是我国的主要油料作物。苏联科学家创造了含油量极高的向日葵品种。社会主义劳动英雄、科学院院士普斯托沃依特所培育的向日葵良种，出油率达到50％以上。在全国种植向日葵的主要地区，这一作物都取得了丰收。例如在克拉斯诺达尔边疆区，向日葵每公顷的平均收获量超过十八公担以上，而在一片六万六千公顷土地上，每公顷竟收获了二十到二十五公担。
    长纤维亚麻今年也丰收了。中亚细亚和南高加索各共和国的集体农庄庄员在克服了很多困难以后，使棉花也得到丰收。蔬菜的收获量也超过了前几年。
    集体农庄男女庄员、国营农场和机器修理站的工作人员，党和苏维埃组织现在正集中力量来争取最迅速地完成收获工作、完成向国家出售农产品的计划。
    在扩大谷物生产、加强饲料基地的基础上，近几年来在发展公有牲畜和提高它们的产品生产率方面已取得很大成就。在1958年初全国牛的头数比1953年增加了一千零九十万头，猪增加了一千一百万只，羊增加了两千万只。
    大家知道，1955年举行的苏共中央一月全会曾提出了在六年内把每头乳牛每年的平均挤奶量至少提高到一千七百公斤的任务。这个任务在1957年已经超额完成，也就是说，在三年内就完成了。1957年每头乳牛的平均挤奶量是一千八百五十八公斤。
    集体农庄和国营农场的公共牧畜业现在在商品畜产品生产中占居主要地位。因此已能使集体农庄农民、工人和职员不必再承担义务交售牛奶、肉类、羊毛和其他农产品的负担。今年牲畜的头数将继续增长。从1957年10月1日到1958年10月1日，集体农庄和国营农场的牛增加了三百五十万头，或者说增加了9％。其中乳牛增加了八十万头。猪增加了一百四十万只，或者说增加了4％；绵羊和山羊增加了六百四十万只，或者说增加了4％。集体农庄和国营农场今年九个月的总产奶量比去年同期增加了7％。
    全体苏联人民以非常满意的心情注意到农业劳动者的成绩。农产品的增产对苏联每个公民说来都有切身的利害关系。实际上，在我国的条件下，农产品的增产就意味着农产品消费的相应增长。同时，这种消费的增长普及于全体居民和所有的民族而无一例外。但在资本主义国家农产品的增产并不能使消费也同时增长。不管是粮食增产或减产，在资本家国度里的几百万失业者——经常的劳动后备军，根本不敢梦想提高消费水平。在这些国家所发表的平均数字后面掩盖着粮食的生产和消费之间的巨大脱节，有产阶级和劳动人民营养水平的悬殊，以及宗主国的居民和殖民地人民饮食的巨大差异。
    苏联农民在完成本农业年度的工作的时候，正准备以更大的高潮来迎接苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会。他们准备在未来的1959年在扩大农产品方面取得新的、更辉煌的成绩：不仅能给国家更多的农产品，而且还是价廉物美的产品。这样来更充分地满足人民对食品的需求和工业对农业原料的需求。（附图片）
