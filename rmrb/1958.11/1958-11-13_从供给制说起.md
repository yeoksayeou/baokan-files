Starting from the Supply System
Hu Sheng

After Liberation, the idea that the supply system had to be abolished was a case of "attacking one point and not the rest."

In the past, we implemented the supply system in revolutionary base areas, among cadres, and in the military. At that time, it was of course impossible to extend the supply system to the entire population. After national liberation, it was still impossible to immediately implement the supply system among the entire population.

Then, after liberation, was it possible to not change the supply system for cadres and the military who originally implemented it, to continue implementing this system, and to gradually expand the scope of implementation according to the situation? It should be said that it was possible. The past supply system was implemented in the environment of war and rural areas. This system should be changed in a new environment, otherwise it would be difficult to implement. This difficulty once led people to disapprove of the system, believing that it must be abolished. It can be said that this is also a case of "attacking one point and not the rest."

After Liberation, if it was not permissible to temporarily switch to a wage system for cadres on the supply system due to certain practical difficulties, it was wrong to absolutize the wage system.

Here, the more important issue is that when implementing the change from the supply system to the wage system, people did not regard this change as a temporary compromise due to certain technical difficulties, but believed that this change was completely reasonable. In order to explain and defend the necessity of this change, people believed that the supply system was completely backward, was a "rural style," and "guerrilla habits"; that the supply system was only suitable for the war environment and not for the situation after liberation, that after national victory, this system should give way, and should never return. According to this view, it seems that in peacetime, in the construction period, people's enthusiasm depends on material incentives, and only material rewards can make people work hard; if the wage system is not implemented, no one will be active, and everyone will become lazy. Such thinking actually developed after the supply system was changed to the wage system. In this way, the supply system was completely negated, while the wage system was absolutized.

If the superiority of the supply system is affirmed without absolutizing the wage system, but only switching to an appropriate wage system for cadres who originally implemented the supply system due to certain practical difficulties, this is not impermissible. But if this change fosters an idea that absolutizes and solidifies the wage system, the principle of "to each according to his work," and sees the supply system as a backward thing, this idea is completely wrong.

Although the socialist principle of "to each according to his work" is revolutionary, it actually recognizes certain principles under the capitalist system.

Some people say, isn't "to each according to his work" the principle of distribution under the socialist system? More work, more gain; less work, less gain; no work, no gain—this is the fairest and most reasonable, and there should be no doubt about it. The socialist system of "to each according to his work" is indeed revolutionary in one aspect. In capitalist society, laborers are not well-fed, while the exploiting classes gain without labor. The socialist system of "to each according to his work" is the result of eliminating the exploiting classes and the exploiting system, so it is of great revolutionary significance.

But on the other hand, the system of "to each according to his work" is far from the fairest and most reasonable method. In practice, people can see that many contradictions and difficulties arise from the system of "to each according to his work." How should the amount of remuneration for various kinds of labor be calculated? For example, what is the difference between teaching for an hour in the classroom and working on a lathe for an hour? I think it is difficult for any economist to make an accurate calculation. It should be admitted that in implementing "to each according to his work," certain principles under the capitalist system are in fact recognized: for example, skilled labor should be paid more than unskilled labor, mental labor should be paid more than physical labor, and the labor of people with higher education should be paid more than the labor of people with less education, etc.

Why are these principles actually principles under the capitalist system? Under the capitalist system, people are able to become skilled laborers and receive more education entirely because of personal circumstances. In capitalist society, a person's education from elementary school to university graduation is a personal "investment," investing so much capital before being able to graduate from university. The law of capitalist society is that the greater the investment, the more "interest" will be received in the future. If the "interest" obtained after graduating from university is the same as after graduating from elementary school, then wealthy people will feel it is not worthwhile and would rather make other investments. So, according to the laws of capitalism, it is reasonable for people who have learned skilled labor and received higher education to receive higher remuneration.

The result of society and the state's cultivation of a person is reflected in the distribution system, but it becomes a personal thing. This is a remnant of bourgeois right.

But in socialist society, it is a completely different matter. Society and the state organize and allocate people's labor according to objective needs, and society and the state cultivate certain people to become skilled laborers and people with higher education. Isn't there a contradiction here when the result of society and the state's cultivation of a person is reflected in the distribution system, but it becomes a personal thing?

The existence of this contradiction shows that certain bourgeois rights are actually retained in the socialist system of "to each according to his work."

When a socialist society with public ownership has just come from the old society, when the level of social productive forces is not very high, when it is not possible to enable everyone to learn skilled labor and receive higher education, when people's thinking cannot completely get rid of the remnants of old ideas from the old society, it is inevitable to retain certain bourgeois rights. But it must be seen that the remnants of bourgeois rights and the further development of socialist productive forces and socialist public ownership are bound to lead to contradictions. It is wrong to not see this contradiction and to regard the system of "to each according to his work" as self-evident.

It is not a terrible thing that contradictions and many difficulties have arisen in the implementation of the wage system of "to each according to his work." Our task is to expose this contradiction, to further develop the distribution system, thereby further promoting the development of socialist public ownership.

Certain bourgeois rights can be utilized, but they should not be absolutized and solidified.

Bourgeois rights were originally the superstructure of the bourgeoisie, intended to consolidate the economic base of the bourgeoisie. In the socialist revolution, we eliminated capitalist relations of production, eliminated the bourgeois exploitation system, and also eliminated the bourgeois state system. So we cannot say that bourgeois rights seem to have not been touched at all in the socialist revolution. On the contrary, a large part of bourgeois rights was destroyed in the socialist revolution. The remnants of bourgeois rights that are still retained under the socialist system are of course far from the complete bourgeois rights in capitalist countries. The bourgeois rights now being talked about are bourgeois rights without the bourgeoisie. Retaining these bourgeois rights is of course not for the purpose of maintaining and consolidating the rule of the bourgeoisie and the capitalist system. If it is not beneficial to socialism, then not a minute of any remnant of bourgeois rights should be retained.

But if the bourgeois rights that are temporarily utilized in the early stage of socialism are absolutized, that is, to believe that bourgeois rights are beneficial to socialism to any extent and at any time, then that is of course not right. The socialist system, under certain conditions, utilizes certain bourgeois rights precisely in order to create conditions to gradually weaken bourgeois rights, until the period when objective conditions are met, to completely eliminate bourgeois rights.

People have also said that since bourgeois rights cannot but be retained in the primary stage of communism, then let's just sit there and wait, and eliminate bourgeois rights all at once when the advanced stage of communism arrives, and that before this, there cannot and should not be any action. This view is not correct. If this is done, it actually solidifies and absolutizes bourgeois rights, making it very difficult to eliminate bourgeois rights in the next step, and hindering the transition from the primary stage of communism to the advanced stage. We must, while temporarily retaining certain bourgeois rights, constantly weaken them, restrict them, and constantly expand our socialist and communist things, and use socialist and communist things to replace bourgeois rights. This will be conducive to the transition from socialism to communism.

Maintaining the supply system among cadres after liberation is beneficial in terms of long-term development.

From this, it can be seen that after national liberation, although it was not possible to implement the supply system among the entire population for a while, because the advanced troops of the people had a tradition of the supply system, maintaining this tradition, with appropriate changes and adjustments, I think is more beneficial. Because doing so is beneficial from the perspective of the long-term historical development of the entire era. Doing so, of course, will encounter some trouble. This trouble is simply that there are two different systems among all state workers, one is the supply system, and the other is the wage system. But if we look at it from the perspective that our long-term task is precisely to weaken bourgeois rights and gradually replace them with socialist and communist things, then it is worth enduring this trouble for a while.

The supply system breaks through the philistine habit of haggling over more work, more gain, and less work, less gain, and will inevitably greatly promote the communist spirit.

Does implementing the supply system mean realizing communism? It cannot be said that yet. Many people's communes in the countryside have already realized eating without money, and even "three guarantees," "five guarantees," "seven guarantees," and so on. It is inappropriate to say that this is communism. But it should be said that it contains communist factors. When the things produced are not so abundant, it is of course not possible to realize the communist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." The so-called communist factor refers to everyone being more consistent, breaking the framework of "to each according to his work." Under the supply system, people no longer haggle over "more work, more gain" and "less work, less gain," which will help people develop the habit of working without haggling over rewards. In the past, when the supply system was implemented in revolutionary base areas and in the military, everyone's treatment was similar, although the conditions for eating and wearing were very poor, but they were all spirited and made revolution, and no one haggled over rewards. This spirit is called the communist spirit.

Some people once said that it was only like that during the war, now that there is peace and construction, doing this again is called "rural style" and "guerrilla habits," and now we have to rely on material incentives, and only "to each according to his work" can make people work hard. According to this "theory," the supply system must collapse. But now the situation of the Great Leap Forward has completely defeated this set of "theories." Practice has defeated this set of outdated theories. Since last winter, tens of millions of peasants in the countryside have been engaged in water conservancy, going up the mountains to mine coal, and opening mines, and no one has talked about "to each according to his work," and many peasants have even brought their own grain to do it. In the cities, participating in voluntary labor has also become a common practice. Because of such a trend, production has greatly leaped forward. No workers say, I should get more wages because I have worked more today. On the contrary, in the Great Leap Forward, workers automatically abolished the piece-rate wage system and abolished overtime pay. Due to the abolition of piece-rate wages and unreasonable reward systems, some workers' wages have even decreased a little. Now people are not working eight hours a day, but voluntarily working ten hours or twelve hours, and working through the night when necessary. During the Great Leap Forward, this spirit of voluntary and unrewarded labor appeared everywhere. People are not working to increase personal income, but for the benefit of all people and the long-term interests. In this case, it is bound to break through the framework of bourgeois rights, break through the system of "to each according to his work," break through the philistine habit of haggling over more work, more gain, and less work, less gain, and will inevitably greatly promote the communist spirit. Therefore, gradually realizing the supply system today is no longer just a matter of a few cadres. It can be seen from the situation of the peasants implementing a partial supply system that the distribution system of the entire society will undergo great changes.

The remnants of bourgeois rights have already greatly hindered the development of social productive forces and should be further attacked.

From this, it can be seen that it is very necessary and timely to raise the issue of bourgeois rights at present and for everyone to seriously discuss it. We should further give bourgeois rights a shock, precisely because it has already played a role in hindering the development of social productive forces to a large extent. Of course, it will not be completely and thoroughly eliminated in one shock. With the greater development of social productive forces, the greater improvement of people's communist consciousness, and the gradual disappearance of the differences between workers and peasants, between cities and the countryside, and between manual and mental labor, the remnants of bourgeois rights will inevitably be completely eliminated. Under socialist conditions, it is wrong to eliminate the remnants of bourgeois rights if the time has not yet come for their elimination; it is also wrong not to eliminate them when the time has come for their elimination.

    从供给制说起
    胡绳
    解放后认为供给制必须废除是“攻其一点不及其余”
    过去，我们在革命根据地，在干部和部队中实行了供给制，那时当然还不可能把供给制推行到全民中去。全国解放以后，立刻在全民中实行供给制，当然也还是不可能的。
    那么解放以后，在原来实行供给制的干部和部队中，不改行工资制，继续实行供给制，并且按照情况，逐步扩大实行这种制度的范围，这是否可能呢？应该说是可以做到的。过去的供给制是在战争和农村的环境中实行的，这种制度在一个新的环境中间应该有所改变，否则实行起来就有困难，这种困难曾经导致了人们不赞成这个制度，认为必须加以废除。可以说这也是一种“攻其一点不及其余”。
    解放后，如果鉴于某些实际困难，在供给制的干部中暂
  时改行工资制并不是不容许，但把工资制绝对化是错误的
    在这里，更重要的问题是，当实行从供给制改为工资制的时候，人们并不是把这种改变看做是由于某些技术上的困难暂时地实行一种妥协，而认为这种改变是完全合理的。人们为了说明和辩护这种改变的必要，就认为供给制完全是落后的，是“农村作风”、“游击习气”；认为供给制这种制度只适合于战争环境，不适合解放以后的形势，全国胜利了，这种制度就应该让位，就应当一去而不复返。按照这种看法，似乎在和平时期，在建设时期，人们的积极性要靠物质刺激，只有物质奖励才能使人们好好劳动；如果不实行工资制谁都不会积极起来，大家都会变成懒汉。这样的思想在供给制改为工资制之后，实际上是发展起来了。这样，供给制就被一笔抹煞，而工资制则被绝对化了。
    如果肯定供给制的优越性而不把工资制绝对化，只是鉴于某些实际困难，暂时在本来实行供给制的干部中也改行适当的工资制，这并不是不能容许的。但是如果这个改变滋长了一种思想，把工资制，把“按劳取酬”原则绝对化，凝固化了，而把供给制度看成是一种落后的东西，这种思想则是完全错误的。
      社会主义的“按劳取酬”虽有革命性，但实际
  上也承认了资本主义制度下的某些原则
    有人说，按劳取酬不是社会主义制度下的分配原则吗？多劳多得，少劳少得，不劳就不得，这是最公平合理的，不应该有任何怀疑。社会主义的按劳取酬制度在一方面说来的确是革命性的。在资本主义社会中，劳动者吃不饱，而剥削阶级则不劳而获。社会主义的按劳取酬制是消灭剥削阶级和剥削制度的结果，所以是有重大的革命性的。
    但是就另一方面说来，按劳取酬制远不是最公平合理的办法。在实践中，人们可以看到，从按劳取酬制中出现了许多矛盾和困难。各种各样的劳动，究竟应该怎样计算取酬的大小呢？例如说，在课堂里教一个小时的书和在车床旁做一个小时的工，究竟有多大差别呢？我想，任何经济学家也很难作出精确的计算。应该承认，在实行按劳取酬时，事实上是承认了资本主义制度下的某些原则：例如熟练劳动要比不熟练劳动得到较多的报酬，脑力劳动要比体力劳动得到较多的报酬，受了较高教育的人的劳动要比受教育较少的人得到较多的报酬等等。
    为什么说这些原则其实是资本主义制度下的原则呢？在资本主义制度下，人们之所以能够成为熟练的劳动，之所以能够受到较多的教育，完全是个人的事情。在资本主义社会中，一个人由小学到大学毕业，是一种个人的“投资”，投了那么多的资本，然后才能大学毕业。资本主义社会的规律就是投资愈大，将来收到的“利息”愈多。如果大学毕业后所得到的“利息”和小学毕业后一样，那么有钱的人就会觉得不上算，就宁愿做别的投资了。所以照资本主义的规律说来，学会了熟练劳动的人，受了较高的教育的人得到较高的报酬是合理的事。
      社会和国家对一个人培养的结果，反映在分
  配制度上，却成了个人的东西，这就是资产阶级法权的残余
    但是在社会主义社会中，完全是另外一回事了。社会和国家按照客观需要而组织和分配人们的劳动，社会和国家培养某些人成为熟练劳动者和受过高等教育的人。社会和国家对一个人的培养的结果，反映在分配制度上，却成了个人的东西，这里难道不是存在着一种矛盾么？
    这种矛盾的存在就表现着，在社会主义的按劳取酬制度中间实际上还保留着某些资产阶级法权。
    在社会主义公有制的社会刚从旧社会过来不久的时候，在社会的生产力水平还不是很高的时候，在还不能使所有人都能学会熟练劳动，都能受到较高教育的时候，在人们的思想还不能完全摆脱从旧社会来的旧思想残余的时候，保留某些资产阶级法权是不可避免的事。但是必须看到资产阶级法权的残余和社会主义生产力，和社会主义公有制的进一步的发展是必然要发生矛盾的。看不见这种矛盾，而把按劳取酬制看成天经地义，是错误的。
    在实行按劳取酬的工资制度时，发生了矛盾和许多困难，并不是什么可怕的事。我们的任务正在于揭露这种矛盾，使分配制度进一步地发展，从而更促进社会主义公有制向前发展。
  可以利用某些资产阶级法权，但不应该把它绝对化和凝固化
    资产阶级法权本来是资产阶级的上层建筑，是为了巩固资产阶级的经济基础的。在社会主义革命中，我们消灭了资本主义的生产关系，消灭了资产阶级剥削制度，同时也就消灭了资产阶级的国家制度。所以我们不能说，在社会主义革命中对资产阶级的法权似乎完全没有动过。恰恰相反，资产阶级法权中很大一部分是在社会主义革命中被摧毁了。在社会主义制度下还保留着资产阶级法权的残余，这当然已经远不是在资本主义国家中的完整的资产阶级法权了。现在所说的资产阶级法权是没有资产阶级的资产阶级法权。保留这种资产阶级法权当然不是为了保持和巩固资产阶级的统治和资本主义制度。如果不是有利于社会主义，那么一分钟也不能保留任何资产阶级法权残余。
    可是如果把社会主义初期暂时加以利用的资产阶级法权绝对化，那就是认为资产阶级法权在任何程度上和在任何时候都有利于社会主义，那当然是不对的。社会主义制度在一定情况下，利用某些资产阶级法权，正是为了创造条件，逐步削弱资产阶级法权，以至在客观条件具备的时期，完全消灭资产阶级法权。
    人们也曾经这样说，既然在共产主义的初级阶段还不能不保留资产阶级法权，那么我们就坐在那里等吧，到了共产主义高级阶段到来的时候再一下子把资产阶级法权消灭，在此以前不能、也不应当有任何作为。这种看法是不对的。如果这样做，实际上就是使资产阶级法权凝固化、绝对化，就是使得下一步消灭资产阶级法权成为很困难的事，也就是阻碍了共产主义的初级阶段向高级阶段的过渡。我们必须在暂时还要保留某些资产阶级法权的时候，不断地削弱它、限制它，不断地扩大我们社会主义共产主义的东西，用社会主义共产主义的东西来代替资产阶级法权。这样才能有利于从社会主义到共产主义的过渡。
    解放后在干部中保持供给制，从长远的发展来看有好处
    由此可见，在全国解放以后，虽然一时还说不到全民实行供给制，但是因为在人民群众的先进部队中，有着供给制的传统，所以保持这个传统，加以适当的改变和调整我看是比较有利的。因为这样做，从长远的整个时代的历史发展来看，是有好处的。这样做，固然要遇到些麻烦，这种麻烦无非是在一切国家工作人员中存在着两种不同的制度，一种是供给制，一种是工资制，可是如果从我们长远的任务正是在于削弱资产阶级法权，逐步地用社会主义共产主义的东西代替资产阶级法权这个观点来看的话，那么，一时忍受这种麻烦也是值得的。
    供给制冲破了在劳动中斤斤计较多劳多得少劳少得的庸人习气，势必大大发扬共产主义精神
    实行了供给制，就是实现共产主义吗？那还不能这样说。现在农村里有许多人民公社已经实现了吃饭不要钱，以至“三包”、“五包”、“七包”等等。如果说这就是共产主义是不恰当的。但是应该说，其中包含着共产主义的因素。在生产的东西还不是那么丰富的时候，当然还不能实现共产主义的“各取所需”。所谓共产主义因素，是指大家比较一致，打破了“按劳取酬”的框框。在供给制下面，人们不再斤斤计较“多劳多得”、“少劳少得”，这将有利于人们养成不是斤斤计较报酬而从事劳动的习惯。过去在革命根据地和部队内实行供给制时，大家的待遇差不多，虽然吃的穿的条件很差，可是都是意气风发地闹革命，并没有人斤斤计较酬劳。这种精神就叫共产主义精神。
    有人曾经说过，那是战争时期，只好如此，现在和平建设，再这样，就叫做“农村作风”、“游击习气”了，现在要靠物质刺激，只能按劳取酬才能使人努力工作。如果按照这个“理论”，供给制必须垮台。可是现在大跃进的形势，完全把这一套“理论”打垮了。实践打垮了这一套陈腐的理论。从去年冬天以来，农村几千万人搞水利，上山挖煤，开矿，并没有人讲要“按劳取酬”，许多农民还带了自己的粮食去干。在城市中，参加义务劳动也成为普遍的风气。由于这样一个风气，生产大大跃进了。没有工人说，我今天多劳动了就该多得一点工资，相反，生产大跃进中，工人们自动取消了计件工资制，取消了加班加点的工资。由于取消了计件工资和不合理的奖励制度，有的工人的工资甚至还减少了一点。现在人们不是一天工作八小时，而是自愿地进行十小时十二小时工作，必要的时候突击通宵。在大跃进中间，这种自愿地、不指望报酬地从事劳动的精神到处出现。人们不是为了增加一点个人所得，而是为全民的、长远的利益而从事劳动。在这种情况下，势必要冲破资产阶级法权的框框，冲破按劳取酬制度，冲破在劳动中斤斤计较多劳多得少劳少得的庸人习气，势必大大发扬共产主义精神。所以，在今天逐步实现供给制已经不是在一部分干部中间的问题，从农民的实行部分供给制情况中就可以看出整个社会的分配制度将有很大的改变。
    资产阶级法权的残余，已经在很大程度上妨碍着社会生产力的发展，应该进一步给予冲击
    由此可见，目前提出资产阶级法权的问题，大家来认真讨论一下，是十分必要的，是适合时宜的。我们应当进一步给资产阶级法权一种冲击，就因为它已经在很大程度内起着妨碍社会生产力发展的作用。它当然还不会在一次冲击下就全部彻底消灭。随着社会生产力的更加发展，人们的共产主义觉悟的更加提高，随着工农差别、城市和农村的差别、体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别的逐步消失，残余的资产阶级法权必将被彻底消灭。资产阶级法权残余在社会主义条件下，如果没有到消灭的时候就去消灭它，那是错误的，到了应该消灭的时候却不去消灭，同样也是错误。 〔此文原载“学术月刊”第十一期，文内插题是本报编者加的。〕
