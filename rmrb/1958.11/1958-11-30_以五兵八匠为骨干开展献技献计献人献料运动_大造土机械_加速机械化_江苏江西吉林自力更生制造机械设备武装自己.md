Xinhua News Agency report: Jiangsu Province, in the mass campaign to urgently manufacture mechanical equipment, is seeing coordinated action between rural and urban areas, with workers and farmers fighting shoulder to shoulder. In just half a month, a large number of various models of machine tools, both standard and simple, have been manufactured.

In order to quickly elevate the "Marshal of Machinery," the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, at the mechanical industry conference held at the end of October, promptly proposed the principles of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with simplicity as the main focus," and "combining large, medium, and small scales, with medium and small scales as the main focus," as well as the policy of "self-reliance, arming ourselves." A large-scale mass movement to urgently manufacture mechanical equipment has been launched throughout the province. The Provincial Party Committee demanded that key industries be armed first through self-reliance, while also arming county and commune industries.

In Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Xuzhou, Suzhou, and other key cities with better technical conditions, mechanical manufacturing factories, under the leadership of the Party Committee, refuted the "simple is backward" theory among engineering and technical personnel, and are now, through the method of combining leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel, launching a mass technical revolution to manufacture various equipment.

Counties and people's communes with very poor technical equipment conditions are also creating miracles from scratch, arming themselves. Liyang County has arranged machine tool production tasks from towns to villages, from factories to communes. They have organized the "five soldiers and eight craftsmen" (demobilized telephone soldiers, mechanical soldiers, drivers, tank soldiers, engineers; blacksmiths, carpenters, silversmiths, coppersmiths, tinsmiths, sheet metal workers, pot menders, and foundrymen) among the masses as the backbone of mechanical manufacturing, while launching a "four offerings" campaign of "skill offering, suggestion offering, personnel offering, and material offering." The farm tool factory of the Nandou People's Commune in this county manufactured 104 various indigenous machine tools in half a month. The Lijian Commune in Xinghua County, utilizing existing mechanical equipment, manufactured 398 various simple lathes in ten days.

After the mass movement of the whole people manufacturing machine tools was launched throughout Jiangsu Province, various mechanical equipment was manufactured set by set. Many counties that originally had only a dozen machine tools and could only repair and assemble farm tools have suddenly developed into counties with hundreds of various simple lathes, planers, drills, and milling machines, capable of both sand casting and forging, as well as cutting and assembling. The originally very poor Nandou People's Commune, in the recent ten days or so, has not only manufactured complete sets of simple lathes, milling machines, drilling machines, and planers, but has also manufactured an indigenous electric welder and a casting and forging workshop. In early November, Suqian County manufactured 120 simple machine tools, 80% of which met national precision requirements.

Currently, the Jiangsu local Party committees have proposed the development direction of "four factories and one workshop" to each county. It is required that each county, through this movement, independently develop a mechanical manufacturing system with an agricultural machinery factory, a general machinery factory, an electrical machinery factory, a ball bearing factory, and a casting, forging, and stamping workshop. At the same time, it is required that each people's commune achieve "major repairs not leaving the commune, minor repairs not leaving the team."

Xinhua News Agency report: Workers in the Jiangxi Province mechanical industry sector are massively building indigenous machine tools to arm themselves in order to produce more mechanical equipment to support the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

Jiangxi's mechanical industry has developed greatly with the leap forward in steel, coal mining, electricity, construction, transportation, and agriculture this year, manufacturing many metallurgical equipment that had never been manufactured before, such as 200 sets of blast furnaces and converters, and more than 2,000 blowers. However, because Jiangxi's mechanical industry foundation is very weak, it still cannot meet the needs of greater development in all aspects in the future. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee believes that the way to solve this contradiction is to fully mobilize the masses, resolutely implement the policy of "small, indigenous groups," vigorously produce indigenous machine tools, rapidly improve and expand mechanical manufacturing capacity, and arm ourselves well in order to better support others. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee recently held an on-site conference on manufacturing simple machine tools at the Provincial Construction Machinery Factory, requiring all employees to learn from the experience of the employees of the Provincial Construction Machinery Factory in manufacturing simple machine tools, and to launch a movement to massively build indigenous machine tools using indigenous methods throughout the province.

The Jiangxi Provincial Construction Machinery Manufacturing Factory is a new factory with only fifteen technicians and some apprentices, and only two machine tools in the entire factory. However, the factory's employees dared to think and dared to act, and in more than a month, using waste steel, wood, cement, and other materials, manufactured 56 indigenous machine tools such as sawing machines, drilling machines, lathes, cranes, and punching machines. Now, more than 200 factories and enterprises in the province are learning from the experience of the Provincial Construction Machinery Factory, massively building machine tools using indigenous methods. The Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory has decided to manufacture 12 large mechanical equipment such as gantry planers, vertical lathes, and radial drilling machines using indigenous methods in the near future. Workers in various mechanical factories in the Fuhe District of Nanchang City are also massively building water tank wire drawing machines, straightening machines, wire shearing machines, wire drawing machines, electric motors, electric welders, and iron coiling machines using indigenous methods. The workers of the iron, wood, and bamboo weaving industries in Xingan County, a total of fifteen cooperative factories, have united, learned from each other's strengths, and helped each other, and have recently manufactured 81 indigenous lathes, indigenous planers, and other indigenous machinery.

Changchun, this newspaper, 29th. The Jilin Province mechanical industry system is massively building indigenous machine tools to arm themselves. The province has already manufactured 600 indigenous machine tools.

The upsurge in massively building indigenous machine tools was formed under the impetus of steel production. Due to supporting the elevation of the "Marshal of Steel," coal, electricity, chemical industry, transportation and other departments have made rapid developments, and a new situation of insufficient mechanical processing capacity has emerged. The Jilin Province mechanical industry system and the machine repair departments of non-mechanical industry systems have proposed the slogan "self-reliance, starting a family with indigenous methods, arming ourselves," mobilizing the technical forces of mechanical manufacturing enterprises, machine repair departments, affiliated factories of colleges and universities, rural blacksmiths and carpenters, etc., to engage in indigenous machine tools. Up to now, the 600 various indigenous lathes, indigenous drilling machines, indigenous planers, indigenous grinding machines, indigenous milling machines, etc., that have been manufactured include a six-meter gantry planer that can process large machine parts and a simple universal lathe that can turn, drill, bore, mill, and spin. In addition, indigenous forging and casting equipment such as clapboard hammers, spring hammers, and centrifugal casting machines have also been manufactured.

The characteristics of this batch of indigenous machine tools are simple structure, easy operation, and low cost, implementing the principles of using less steel, using more substitutes, using less finished wood, and using more waste materials. At the same time, due to the massive construction of indigenous machine tools, the province's mechanical processing capacity has greatly increased. Many factories have gone from weak to strong, from small to large, transforming repair shops into manufacturing plants. The repair shop of the Shixian Paper Mill, after two or three months of massively building indigenous equipment to arm themselves, has transformed from a workshop that could only prepare sporadic parts and perform general mechanical repairs into a mechanical manufacturing factory. The Tonghua Machinery Factory was originally a small mechanical repair factory, but now it has been equipped with self-made indigenous machine tools into a mechanical manufacturing factory capable of manufacturing smelting equipment, mining equipment, and large paper-making equipment. Fuyu County has already achieved the goal of having indigenous machine tools in every township, and can rely on its own strength to repair and assemble farm tools. (Attached picture)

    以五兵八匠为骨干开展献技献计献人献料运动
    大造土机械  加速机械化
    江苏江西吉林自力更生制造机械设备武装自己
    据新华社讯　江苏省在突击制造机械设备的群众性运动中，农村与城市协同动作，工人与农民并肩作战，仅仅半个月就制造出大批各种型号的和简易适用的机床。
    为了使机械元帅迅速升帐，中共江苏省委在10月底召开的机械工业会议上，及时提出了“土洋结合、以简易为主”，“大中小结合，以中小为主”的原则，以及“自力更生，武装自己”的方针，在全省范围内展开一个大规模的突击制造机械设备的群众运动。省委要求首先自力更生地武装重点的工业，同时武装县社工业。
    南京、无锡、常州、徐州、苏州等几个技术条件较好的重点城市的机械制造工厂，在党委领导下，驳倒了工程技术人员中的“简易倒退论”之后，正通过领导干部、工人与技术人员三结合的办法，展开了群众性的技术革命，制造各种设备。
    原来技术设备条件很差的县和人民公社，也正在白手起家地创造奇迹，自己武装自己。溧阳县从城镇到乡村，从工厂到公社，都安排了机床生产的任务。他们组织了群众中的“五兵、八匠”（复员的电话兵，机械兵，汽车驾驶兵，坦克兵，工兵；铁匠，木匠，银匠，铜匠，锡匠，白铁匠，补锅匠和冶匠）作为机械制造的骨干，同时发动群众开展“献技、献计、献人、献料”的“四献”运动。这个县的南渡人民公社农具厂，在半个月内制成各种土机床一百零四台。兴化县李健公社十天之内就利用原有的机械设备制成了各种简易车床三百九十八台。　
    全民大造机床的群众运动在江苏全省展开之后，各种机械设备就一套一套地制造出来了。许多本来只有十几台机床、只能修配农具的县，一下子就发展成为拥有几百台车、刨、钻、铣各式简易机床，既能翻砂又能锻压，既能切削又能装配的县。原来条件很差的南渡人民公社在最近十几天内，不仅成套地制成了车铣钻刨各式简易机床，而且还制成了土电焊机和一个铸锻车间。宿迁县在11月上旬制造成的一百二十台简易机床，有80％的精密度达到国家要求。
    目前，江苏各地地委向各县提出了“四厂一间”的发展方向。要求各县通过这次运动，自力更生地发展成有农业机械厂、通用机器厂、电机厂、滚珠轴承厂和一个铸锻冲压车间的机械制造体系。同时，要求各人民公社做到“大修不出社，小修不出队”。
    据新华社讯　江西省机械工业部门职工正在大造土机床来武装自己，以便生产更多的机械设备支援工农业生产大跃进。
    江西机械工业随着今年钢铁、采煤、电业、建筑、交通运输和农业等方面的跃进而有了很大的发展，制造了许多从未制造过的冶金设备，如高炉、转炉等就有两百套，鼓风机两千多台。但是由于江西机械工业基础十分薄弱，仍然不能满足今后各方面更大发展的需要。中共江西省委认为，解决这一矛盾的途径，是充分发动群众，坚决贯彻“小土群”的方针，大力生产土机床，迅速提高和扩大机械制造能力，武装好自己，以便更好地支援别人。为此，省委最近在省建筑机械厂召开了全省制造简易机床的现场会议，要求全体职工学习省建筑机械厂职工制造简易机床的经验，在全省范围内掀起一个用土办法大造土机床的运动。
    江西省建筑机械制造厂是个新厂，只有十五名技工和部分学徒，全厂仅有两台机床。可是厂里职工敢想敢干，在一个多月的时间内用废旧钢铁、木头、水泥等材料，制造出锯床、钻床、车床、起重机、冲床等土机床五十六部。现在全省有二百多个工厂、企业，正在学习省建筑机械厂的经验，用土办法大造机床。南昌柴油机厂决定在最近期间用土办法制造龙门刨床、立式车床、摇臂钻床等十二台大型机械设备。南昌市抚河区各机械工厂工人也在用土办法大造水箱拔丝机、调直机、剪丝机、拉丝机、电动机、电焊机、卷铁机等。新淦县的铁、木、篾三个行业、共十五个合作工厂的工人们联合起来，取长补短，互相协助，最近已经制成八十一台土车床、土刨床等土机械。
    本报长春29日电　吉林省机械工业系统大造土机床，武装自己。全省已经制造出土机床六百台。
    大造土机床的热潮是在钢铁生产的带动下形成的。由于支援钢铁元帅升帐，煤炭、电力、化工、交通运输等部门都有飞跃的发展，出现了机械加工能力不足的新情况。吉林省机械工业系统和非机械工业系统的机修部门，提出了“自力更生、以土发家、武装自己”的口号，动员了机械制造企业、机修部门、大专学校的附属工厂、农村铁木匠等技术力量，大搞土机床。到目前为止，所制造出的六百台各种土车床、土钻床、土刨床、土磨床、土铣床等，其中包括可以加工大型机件的六公尺龙门刨床，可以车、钻、掏、铣、旋的简易万能车床。此外，还制造出夹板锤、弹簧锤、离心浇铸机等土锻、铸设备。
    这批土机床的特点是构造简单，操作容易，成本低廉，贯彻了少用钢材、多用代用品，少用成材、多用废料的原则。同时，由于大造土机床，使全省的机械加工能力大大增加。许多工厂由弱而强，由小而大，变修配厂为制造厂。石岘造纸厂的修配车间，经过两三个月的大造土设备，武装自己，已由一个只能配制零星部件和进行一般机械修配的车间，变为机械制造厂。通化机械厂原来是一个小型机械修配厂，现在已经用自造的土机床装备成一个能制造冶炼设备、矿山设备和大型造纸设备的机械制造厂。扶余县已经达到乡乡有土机床，可以依靠自己的力量修配农具。（附图片）
