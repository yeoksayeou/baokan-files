Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation gave reports to over 50,000 people in the capital today, including workers, students, government officials, members of democratic parties, and cadres of people's organizations. In their reports, the heroes recounted their great achievements in fighting the American aggressors alongside the Korean people, and the unbreakable combat friendship forged in blood between the Chinese and Korean people during their joint struggle. These reports greatly inspired and educated everyone, and were warmly welcomed by the masses.

This morning at 9:00 AM, the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace held a report meeting at the Capital Theater, inviting Major General Zhang Mingyuan, a representative of the Volunteer Army delegation, to give a report. More than 1,700 people from various democratic parties and people's organizations in Beijing attended. In his report, Major General Zhang Mingyuan cited many specific facts to powerfully demonstrate the brilliance and correctness of Chairman Mao's thesis that "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," and explained that the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea was a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. He also described the brotherly and close friendship forged between the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people in the struggle of sharing life and death and going through thick and thin together. Many people were moved by these historical battle stories and constantly shouted slogans and applauded, thanking the heroes for their great contributions to defending the motherland. When the report meeting ended, a group of Young Pioneers ran onto the stage to present flowers and red scarves to Major General Zhang Mingyuan and other ten Volunteer Army representatives to pay their respects. In the afternoon, Major General Ding Laifu, a representative of the Volunteer Army delegation, gave a report to more than 1,000 cadres from central and Beijing party and government organizations, which was also warmly welcomed.

Today, the Volunteer Army delegation also sent more than forty representatives to fifteen locations to give reports to workers, university students, and people from all walks of life. The workers of the four cotton textile factories in Beijing sang their own welcome songs: "The wheat seedlings are green and the rapeseed flowers are yellow, the Volunteer Army has come to our factory, the textile workers are all smiling! It sounds like thunder in all directions." They lined the streets to welcome the Volunteer Army representatives. After listening to the report of Volunteer Army representative Zhang Leting, the workers wrote a large number of letters of condolences and salutations, expressing their determination to learn from the spirit of hard work of the Volunteer Army. The staff of Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory proposed to go all out and complete the leap forward plan of producing 24,000 pieces of cotton yarn in the fourth quarter ahead of schedule. The textile workers also presented the heroes with the yarn and cloth they produced and the model of a cannonball made of steel they forged overnight. The staff of the Third Branch of the North China Radio Equipment Factory stated that they must learn from the Volunteer Army's perseverance in overcoming all difficulties, show the determination to make another leap forward, resolutely complete the production plan, and present a gift to the most beloved people. The "Beijing No. 1" aircraft model made by the students of Beijing Aviation Institute was also presented to the Volunteer Army representatives.

The reports of the Volunteer Army representatives enabled the broad masses to further recognize the true face of American imperialism as a paper tiger. Zhao Zongkun, a blast furnace worker at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, said: "We defeated American imperialism with relatively poor equipment, turning American imperialism's 'air and sea superiority' into 'air and sea worries'. I want to learn from the Volunteer Army's noble qualities of doing everything for the motherland, and produce more steel for the motherland. Once the motherland needs it, I will go to the front line at any time to strike the aggressors." The Jingsi Mining Bureau, China Renmin University, and the Central University for Nationalities, which are far from the city center, also held gatherings of thousands of people today, respectively, to warmly welcome and thank the Volunteer Army representatives for their moving reports.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation headed by General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping, as well as the Volunteer Army Art Troupe, watched "The Paper Tiger Exposed" tonight with Vice Chairman Zhu De and Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Fuchun.

The four-act current affairs satirical comedy "The Paper Tiger Exposed," performed by the China Youth Art Theater to welcome the Volunteer Army delegation, vividly portrayed the embarrassing faces of Eisenhower, Dulles, and their like, who sent American troops to occupy Lebanon and the Taiwan Strait area, creating tense situations, and were opposed by the Arab people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world.

The scenes on the stage where the original forms of the American paper tigers were exposed from time to time caused the Volunteer Army heroes, who had personally punctured the American paper tigers on the Korean battlefield, to burst into laughter.

After the entire performance ended, General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, went on stage to meet the actors and presented them with flower baskets.

Tonight's welcome party for the Volunteer Army Delegation was jointly sponsored by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the National Committee of CPPCC, the Chinese People's Resist-America and Aid-Korea General Association, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, the Municipal CPPCC, and the Municipal Resist-America and Aid-Korea Branch.

    志愿军代表分别向首都人民作报告
    新华社3日讯　中国人民志愿军代表团代表今天分别向首都工人、学生、机关干部和各民主党派人士、各人民团体干部共五万多人作报告。英雄们在报告中叙述了他们与朝鲜人民并肩打败美国侵略者的丰功伟绩，以及中朝人民在共同斗争中用鲜血凝成的牢不可破的战斗友谊。这些报告给予大家很大的鼓舞和教育，受到广大群众热烈的欢迎。

    今天，志愿军代表团还派出四十多位代表分别到十五个地方向工人、大学生及各阶层人士作报告。北京四个棉纺织厂的工人们唱着自己创作的欢迎歌曲：“麦苗青来菜花黄，志愿军来到咱们的工厂，纺织工人齐欢笑呀！好像春雷响四方。”夹道欢迎志愿军代表。在听了志愿军代表张乐亭的报告后，工人们写了大批的慰问信和致敬信，表示决心学习志愿军艰苦奋斗的精神。北京棉纺织二厂的职工提出要鼓足干劲提前完成第四季度生产二万四千件棉纱的跃进计划。纺织工人们还把自己生产的纱布和用连夜炼出的钢制成的炮弹模型献给英雄们。华北无线电器材厂三分厂职工表示一定要学习志愿军排除万难的毅力，拿出再跃进的决心，坚决完成生产计划，向最可爱的人献礼。北京航空学院学生自制的“北京一号”的飞机模型，也献给了志愿军代表。
    志愿军代表的报告，使广大群众进一步认清了美帝国主义纸老虎的真面目。石景山钢铁公司高炉工人赵宗昆说：“我们用较差的装备打败了美帝国主义，使美帝国主义的‘海空优势，变成‘海空忧愁’，我要学习志愿军一切为了祖国的高贵品质，为祖国炼出更多的钢铁，一旦祖国需要的时候，随时开赴前线打击侵略者。”远离市区的京西矿务局和中国人民大学、中央民族学院等单位今天也分别举行了数千人的大会，热烈欢迎和感谢志愿军代表为他们所作的动人心弦的报告。
    新华社3日讯　以杨勇上将和王平上将为首的中国人民志愿军代表团以及志愿军文艺工作团，今天晚间和朱德副主席，陈毅、李富春副总理等一起，笑看“纸老虎现形记。”
    为欢迎志愿军代表团，由中国青年艺术剧院演出的四幕时事讽刺喜剧“纸老虎现形记”，淋漓尽致地刻划了艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流，派遣美国军队侵占黎巴嫩和台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势以来，受到阿拉伯人民、中国人民和全世界人民反对，所表现的那副狼狈嘴脸。
    那些在舞台上出现的美国纸老虎原形毕露的场景，不时地引得亲自在朝鲜战场上戳穿美国纸老虎的志愿军英雄们哄堂大笑。
    演出全部结束后，杨勇和王平将军由陈毅副总理陪同，登上舞台和演员们会见，并向他们赠送了花篮。
    今天这个欢迎志愿军代表团的晚会，是由人大常委会、政协全国委员会、中国人民抗美援朝总会、北京市人民委员会、市政协和市抗美援朝分会联合主办的。
