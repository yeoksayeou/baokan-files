Don't Let "Flu" Become Popular Again
Hu Wenyun, Physician, Chaoyang District Health and Epidemic Prevention Station, Beijing

    When the weather turns cold, more people catch colds. Although a cold is considered a "minor" illness, it often leads to epidemics, so it cannot be ignored. This year, health workers in the Beijing area have put forward the slogan: "Guarantee the Great Leap Forward in production, and don't let the flu become popular again."

    The common cold usually includes two diseases: one is a cold, that is, the common cold; the other is influenza, or flu for short. They are caused by two different viruses, and the symptoms are also slightly different. Common colds occur more often in winter, with milder systemic symptoms, only the nasal obstruction is obvious, but it is not easy to spread on a large scale. Flu often spreads throughout the province, country, and even the world. Although it occurs more often in winter, it also occurs in other seasons, with severe systemic symptoms.

    The pathogen of a cold is a filterable virus, a microorganism so small that it cannot even be seen with a microscope. There are many types. For example, there are now two known types of influenza virus, namely type A and type B, and each type has several subtypes. This virus was not seen by humans until the invention of the electron microscope in the mid-20th century. Epidemiologists have found the pattern of the disease: small epidemics usually occur every two to four years, and large epidemics usually occur every fifteen to thirty years.

    When cold symptoms begin, the nose and throat are itchy, dry, and feverish, sometimes slightly painful, with sneezing, difficulty breathing through the nose, general discomfort, fatigue, lack of energy, fear of cold, and pain in the joints and muscles of the back and limbs. After a day or two, the above symptoms worsen, with fever, cough, poor appetite, etc., and some may also experience vomiting and indigestion. If treatment and nursing care are appropriate, most people can recover in about a week. Children with colds generally have more severe symptoms, often with high fever, coma, convulsions, and are prone to complications such as pneumonia and meningitis, so special attention should be paid.

    To prevent colds, in addition to paying attention to the cold and heat in daily life, participating in outdoor activities appropriately to enhance resistance, keeping the bedroom clean, and disinfecting tableware, outdoor labor should pay attention to keeping warm, avoiding sudden cold and heat from indoor to outdoor, and wearing a mask when going to public places is best. Avoid contact with patients with colds. Recently, the use of A de ping ephedrine solution to drip the nose and the use of influenza vaccines have been very effective, but these drugs can only be used when the flu epidemic is serious.

### 不让“流感”再流行

    不让“流感”再流行
    北京朝阳区卫生防疫站医师　胡文尧
    天气一冷，感冒的人就多起来。虽感冒算“小”病，但是往往造成流行，所以不容忽视。今年，北京地区的卫生工作者提出了这样的口号：“保证生产大跃进，不让流感再流行。”
    通常所谓感冒，包括两种疾病：一种是伤风，即普通感冒；另一种是流行性感冒，简称流感。它们由二种不同的病毒引起，症状也不大一样。普通感冒冬季发病多，全身症状较轻，只是鼻部阻塞明显，但不易大面积流行。流感常在全省、全国、全世界范围内流行，冬季发病虽多，其他季节也不少，全身症状重。
    感冒的病原是滤过性病毒，是小得连显微镜也不能看到的生物。种类很多，例如流感病毒现在知道的就分二型，即甲型、乙型，每一型里还有若干亚型。这种病毒直到二十世纪中叶电子显微镜发明以后才被人类看到。流行病工作者找到了发病的规律：小流行一般是二至四年一次，大流行一般是十五至三十年一次。
    感冒症状开始时，鼻子、咽喉发痒发干发烧，有时稍痛，打嚏，鼻难通气，全身不舒，疲倦无力，精神不振，怕冷，背部四肢的关节和肌肉疼痛。一、二日后，上述症状加重，有发烧、咳嗽、胃口不好等现象，有的还会呕吐，消化不良。如果治疗和护理得当，的大约一星期就能痊愈。小孩得感冒，症状一般比较严重，往往发高烧、晕迷、抽搐，并容易带来合并症，如肺炎、脑膜炎等，要特别注意。
    预防感冒，除了日常注意冷热、适当参加户外运动增强抵抗力、卧室清洁、食具消毒外，户外劳动要注意保暖，从室内到室外避免忽冷忽热，去公共场所最好戴口罩。不要同患感冒的病人接触。近来采用阿的平麻黄素溶液滴鼻及采用流感疫苗很奏效，不过这些药物只有在感冒流行情况严重时才能采用。
