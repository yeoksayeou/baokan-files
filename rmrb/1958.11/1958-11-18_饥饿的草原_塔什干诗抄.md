    "Hungry Steppe"
    — Poems from Tashkent
    Guo Xiaochuan
    Hungry Steppe
    A green cotton field stretches as far as the eye can see,
    Distant rows of poplars resemble mountain ranges,
    Ten thousand miles of clear sky without a trace of cloud,
    Cars speed along the road without raising dust.
    After eleven turns amidst groves of trees,
    Fragrant flowers and statues suddenly block the way,
    On the right are rows of beige residences,
    On the left stands a magnificent palace.
    This palace has never been governed by emperors,
    An amateur theater group's poster hangs at the door,
    These residences are not inhabited by dukes or generals,
    But by agronomists, teachers, and farm workers.
    About a hundred meters from the Cultural Palace,
    A small bridge arches across the road,
    The stream beneath the bridge tinkles and sings,
    Ten thousand ditches and canals like small snakes crawl into the gardens.
    Beyond the village, the view remains boundless,
    Green cotton fields and green skies.
    If you ask what place this is,
    Before the revolution, it was called "Hungry Steppe."

    Evening Talk
    The nights on the steppe are long,
    The winds on the steppe are cool,
    The old chairman's words are clear and crisp,
    Like an electric light shining in the hearts of the guests.
    "If this were forty years ago,
    None of you could enter the 'Hungry Steppe,'
    If anyone entered the 'Hungry Steppe,'
    I guarantee eight or nine out of ten wouldn't return.
    "'Hungry Steppe' is wide and vast,
    For three to five days, you wouldn't find sweet water or rice.
    The steppe's climate changes several times a day,
    Wear a single layer at noon, and at night, you must wear cotton clothes.
    "The steppe's land is a million hectares,
    But it was full of desolation, only wild grass growing.
    The steppe's lakes also number several,
    But they were salty and bitter, drinking them meant death.
    "Since we had the canals and irrigation ditches,
    The steppe's alkaline land has turned into ten thousand hectares of fertile fields.
    Since we had the forests and green belts,
    The steppe's climate is no longer abruptly hot and cold.
    "Since the establishment of Soviet power,
    Brothers of all nationalities have come to build the steppe.
    Since Lenin ordered the construction of the steppe,
    The steppe has gradually become Uzbekistan's paradise."
    The nights on the steppe are long,
    The winds on the steppe are cool,
    The old chairman's words are clear and crisp,
    Like an electric light shining in the hearts of the guests.

    A Feast of Melons and Fruits
    The world has millions upon millions of melons and fruits,
    None are sweeter than the melons here,
    The Chinese people have friends all over the world,
    None are more beautiful than the friendship of comrades.
    "Eat, the melons come from our own melon garden,
    No need to worry that you will eat them all.
    Eat, this is your home,
    Today, no one is allowed to miss home."
    The host's words were repeated several times,
    The guests' hearts soared to the ninth heaven.
    The laughter at the table hadn't yet subsided,
    When apples and grapes were brought out in three large platters.
    "In the years of struggle, we were partners,
    During moments of rest, we are like family.
    What distinction is there between China and the Soviet Union?
    Branches from the same root are closely connected."
    The host was so happy he couldn't close his eyes,
    The guests were so delighted they simply didn't want to return,
    If they weren't thinking about tomorrow's work,
    They would truly have eaten themselves to death on the "Hungry Steppe."

    Collective Farm Chairman
    His tall body is like a bear,
    His voice louder than a lion's roar,
    He leaps up a high slope in three or two steps,
    At fifty years old, his legs are still so agile.
    "Look over here, three thousand hectares of wasteland,
    The government has allocated it to us for permanent use.
    We set a three-year reclamation plan,
    Now we are determined to complete it in two years."
    Indeed, it is a wilderness of wild grass,
    No people on the ground, only eagles in the sky,
    The scorching sun casts down ten thousand fiery rays,
    The yellow wind burns into the high sky like flames.
    "Look over here, ten thousand hectares of cotton fields,
    All cultivated by our own hands.
    Lenin told us to come here,
    We started from scratch, overcoming numerous difficulties."
    What a lush expanse of green cotton fields,
    Like an endless carpet, smooth and even,
    Bowl-sized cotton bolls swaying in the sun,
    Like green stars twinkling in the sky.
    "Look in the distance, at the snow-capped mountains,
    No matter how high, they can't surpass our atomic energy;
    Before long, we will flatten them,
    We'll see who is a coward and who is a hero!"
    The distant mountains are really unclear,
    Only the chairman running down the slope in a gust of wind,
    He raises his big hand and waves it twice in the air,
    The guests follow him towards the Cultural Palace...

    Yang-Ge Yelu
    A group of foreign guests came to Yang-Ge Yelu,
    As soon as they got off the car, they went to visit the buildings,
    Many tall buildings have already been completed,
    The builders of the steppe have just moved in.
    There is also a group of buildings that have not yet been completed,
    Cranes and machines are booming and rumbling.
    All this does not surprise the guests,
    In the Soviet Union, this is a very common thing.
    The host inadvertently said the following:
    "This city is only one year old,"
    Suddenly aroused a burst of activity among the guests,
    Several friends from afar shouted in unison.
    One friend said: "In our country,
    A small dam has not been built in four years,
    The people tighten their belts and pay a lot of money,
    Only to supply the rulers to embezzle and corrupt."
    Another said: "You build a city in one year,
    I myself sat in prison four times in ten years.
    People have such different interests,
    Our government is only interested in prisons."
    Another said: "We are not without wealth,
    It is just that it has all been plundered into the warehouses of imperialism.
    If we gain sovereignty and independence,
    We will also be able to build several Yang-Ge Yelu."
    The host did not interrupt for a while,
    A humble and sympathetic gaze flickered.
    Finally, he said: "This is just a small base,
    For the development of the vast 'Hungry Steppe'!"

    “饥饿的草原”
    ——塔什干诗抄
    郭小川
    饥饿的草原
    一片绿色棉田望不见边，
    远处的层层白杨像群山，
    万里晴空没有一丝云雾，
    汽车驰骋在马路上无尘烟。
    万树丛中拐了十一道湾，
    香花和塑像忽然把路拦，
    右面是幢幢米色的宅第，
    左面是一座高大的宫殿。
    这宫殿从来不属帝王管，
    业余剧团的海报挂门前，
    这宅第也不住公侯将相，
    住的是农学家、教师和庄员。
    文化宫那边约摸百米远，
    有座小桥弓身在大路间，
    桥下的流水叮叮当当响，
    千沟万渠像小蛇爬进田园。
    出了村庄还是望不见边，
    绿色的棉田绿色的长天。
    若问此处是个什么所在，
    革命前叫做“饥饿的草原”。
    夜话
    草原的夜呀长又长，
    草原的风呀凉又凉，
    老主席的话呀清又脆，
    像那电灯一般照在客人心上。
    “假如时间是在四十年前，
    你们谁也进不了‘饥饿的草原’，
    假如谁进了‘饥饿的草原’，
    包管十有八九不得回还。
    “‘饥饿的草原’宽又广，
    三天五日见不到甜水和米粮。
    草原的气候一天变几次，
    午穿单褂，夜间就要穿棉衣裳。
    “草原的土地有一百万公顷，
    却是满目荒凉，只有野草丛生。
    草原的湖泊也有好几处，
    却是又咸又苦，喝了就要丧命。
    “自从有了运河和灌溉的沟堑，
    草原的碱地变成万顷良田。
    自从有了树林和绿化地带，
    草原的气候也不再乍热乍寒。
    “自从建立了苏维埃政权，
    各民族的兄弟都来建设草原。
    自从列宁下令建设草原，
    草原就逐渐成了乌兹别克的乐园。”
    草原的夜呀长又长，
    草原的风呀凉又凉，
    老主席的话呀清又脆，
    像那电灯一般照在客人心上。
    瓜果的筵席
    世界上的瓜果有千万万，
    没有比这儿的香瓜更甜，
    中国人的朋友遍天下，
    没有比同志的友情更美满。
    “吃吧，瓜儿出自自家瓜园，
    用不着耽心你们会吃完。
    吃吧，这儿就是你们的家，
    今天谁也不许把家想念。”
    主人的话儿说了好几遍，
    客人的心儿上了九层天。
    席上的笑声还来不及收住，
    苹果、葡萄又端上三大盘。
    “战斗的年代咱们是伙伴，
    休息的时刻也像家人一般。
    苏中两国还分什么彼此，
    一个根上的枝叶脉脉相连。”
    主人喜欢得合不上眉眼，
    客人高兴得简直不想回还，
    若不是想着明天的工作，
    真会饱死在“饥饿的草原”。
    集体农庄主席
    高大的身体活像一只熊，
    说话赛过大狮的吼叫声，
    三步两步跳上一座高岗，
    五十岁的人腿脚还这么灵。
    “看这边，是荒地三千顷，
    政府已拨给我们永久使用。
    我们定下了三年开垦计划，
    现在决心要在两年内完成。”
    果然是一片荒原野草丛生，
    地上无人，但见天上的鹰，
    烈日炎炎撒下了万把火，
    黄风像火苗儿烧上高空。
    “再看这边，是棉田万顷，
    全是我们亲手开垦而成。
    列宁叫我们来到这里的，
    我们白手起家冲破困难重重。”
    好一片绿色棉田葱茏茏，
    像块无边的地毯溜溜平，
    碗大的棉桃在太阳下头摆，
    宛如青青天上闪金星。
    “再看远处，那高山白顶，
    再高也胜不过咱的原子能；
    用不了好久就要它化为平地，
    到底试试谁是脓包谁英雄！”
    远处的高山实在看不清，
    只见主席跑下斜坡一溜风，
    他举起大手在空中挥两下，
    客人们跟他走向文化宫。……
    杨格·叶鲁
    一群外宾来到杨格·叶鲁，
    刚下汽车就去参观建筑物，
    许多高大的楼房已经竣工，
    草原的建设者们刚搬进去住。
    还有一批建筑群未曾建成，
    吊车和机械正在轰轰隆隆。
    所有这些并不使客人惊异，
    在苏联这是极普通的事情。
    主人不经意地说了下面的话：
    “这个城市仅仅有一年历史”，
    忽然在客人中引起一阵活跃，
    几位远方的朋友同声叫奇。
    一位朋友说：“在我们国家，
    四年还没有建成一座小水坝，
    人民扎紧裤带付出大量金钱，
    只不过供给统治者贪污腐化”。
    另一位说：“你们一年建一个城市，
    我自己十年坐了四次监狱。
    人与人之间爱好如此不同，
    我们政府只对监狱发生兴趣。”
    又一位说：“我们并非没有财富，
    只是都被掠进帝国主义的仓库。
    如果我们获得了主权和独立，
    也完全能建设几个杨格·叶鲁。”
    主人好一会儿没有插言，
    谦逊又同情的目光一闪一闪。
    最后才说：“这只是一个小基地，
    为了开发辽阔的‘饥饿的草原’！”
