    The Hungry Steppe, slumbering on the borders of the three Soviet republics of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan in southern Soviet Union before the October Revolution, was a desolate and uninhabited desert. To develop this vast steppe of over 100,000 square kilometers was the ideal of the peoples of Central Asia for generations. However, before the revolution, only a little over 30,000 hectares of land on the Hungry Steppe were irrigated.
    The great October Revolution brought life to the Hungry Steppe. As early as 1918, when the Soviet regime had just been established, Lenin signed a decree stipulating the allocation of funds for water conservancy projects on the Hungry Steppe. The steppe awakened, and since then, more than 200,000 hectares of land have been reclaimed in the past forty years.
    In 1956, the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers decided to further develop the Hungry Steppe on a large scale, stipulating that 300,000 hectares of land should be reclaimed and irrigated there, turning barren land into cotton fields. Thus began the great march towards the Hungry Steppe!
    Thousands upon thousands of Soviet youths, scientific workers, and surveyors, for the noble purpose of communist construction, came to the steppe from all directions, unafraid of difficulties and hardships. The results of scientists' research have proved that it is possible to irrigate 800,000 hectares of land on the Hungry Steppe. In the next few years, dozens of new state farms will be built on the steppe, completing the task of reclaiming 300,000 hectares of land. At that time, these newly reclaimed lands will be able to supply the state with more than 300,000 tons of raw cotton annually. By 1962, in the heart of the arid steppe desert, several large canals and irrigation ditches with a total length of 7,000 kilometers will have been built.
    The face of the steppe is changing with each passing day. Currently, the new socialist city of Yangiyer is being built in the center of the Hungry Steppe. Many highways have now been built to the center of the steppe; millions of small trees have been planted on the steppe this spring. Construction projects such as cities, farms, cotton ginning factories, and railways are in full swing. The farmers on the steppe have already obtained good harvests, and cotton, grapes, melons and fruits have appeared on the Hungry Steppe... The people living on the Hungry Steppe have been freed from hunger and poverty forever. (Xuan) (with pictures)

    饥饿草原开花结果
    十月革命前，沉睡在苏联南部乌兹别克、哈萨克和塔吉克三个加盟共和国边界的饥饿草原，一片荒漠，渺无人烟。开发这一万多平方公里的大草原，是中亚细亚各族人民世世代代的理想。但是，革命前饥饿草原上只有三万多公顷土地得到灌溉。
    伟大的十月革命为饥饿草原带来了生命。早在苏维埃政权刚刚成立的1918年，列宁签署了一项法令，规定拨款在饥饿草原上兴修水利。草原苏醒了，从那时起，四十年来已经开垦了二十多万公顷土地。
    1956年，苏共中央和部长会议决定进一步大规模开发饥饿草原，规定要在那里开垦和灌溉三十万公顷土地，使荒地变棉田。于是，向饥饿草原的大进军便开始了！
    成千上万的苏联青年、科学工作者和勘探人员，为了共产主义建设的崇高目的，不畏惧艰难困苦，从四面八方来到了草原上。经科学家研究的结果证明，在饥饿草原上有可能灌溉八十万公顷土地。在最近几年内，草原上将建起数十个新的国营农场，完成开垦三十万公顷土地的任务。那时，这些新垦地每年将可供给国家三十多万吨原棉。到1962年，在干涸草原沙漠的腹部，将修好数条大运河和总长度达七千公里的灌溉渠。
    草原的面貌日新月异。目前，正在饥饿草原的中心兴建新的社会主义城市杨吉—叶拉。许多条公路现在已修到草原中心；千百万棵小树已在今年春天种在草原上。城市、农场、净棉厂、铁路等修建工程正在紧张进行中。草原上的农民们已获得了很好的收成，饥饿草原上已出现了棉花、葡萄、瓜果……生活在饥饿草原上的人们已经永远地摆脱饥饿贫困的处境了。（萱）（附图片）
