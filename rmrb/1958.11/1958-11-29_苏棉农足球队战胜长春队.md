    This newspaper reports: Yesterday, the Soviet Tashkent Cotton Growers football team defeated our Changchun football team by a score of 1-0 at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium in Beijing.

    The Changchun team did not play ideally yesterday. Their usual aggressive and tenacious style was not well executed. In the first half, the Changchun team dribbled too much, made many passing errors, and the forwards and defenders seemed a bit disconnected. For the first ten minutes or so, the visiting team had the upper hand, constantly pressing the home team. In a short period of ten minutes or so, they shot at the goal six or seven times. At twenty-eight minutes, the visiting team besieged the home team's goal. Number 11, Sepeer, went deep into the penalty area, got the ball in the melee, and with a powerful shot, the ball entered the net from the upper right corner of the goal, opening the scoring. After losing the goal, the home team launched several counterattacks, but all were unsuccessful. The first half ended 1-0.

    In the second half, the Changchun team played more smoothly, reversing the passive situation of the first half and constantly pressing the visiting team. However, because the Changchun team used central breakthroughs too much, although the offensive was frequent, it was always difficult to break through the visiting team's dense defense, and they did not score a goal until the end of the game. The visiting team focused on defense in the second half, and the forwards also did not contribute. The score of 1-0 was maintained until the end of the game.

    苏棉农足球队战胜长春队
    本报讯　昨天，苏联塔什干棉农足球队在北京先农坛体育场以一比零战胜我国长春足球队。
    长春队昨天打得不够理想。平日的猛冲猛打、勇敢顽强的作风没有得到很好的发挥。上半时，长春队盘带过多，传球很多失误，锋卫也显得有点脱节。前十几分钟客队占尽了优势，一直压住主队打，在短短的十几分钟内射了六七次门。在二十八分钟时，客队围攻主队大门，十一号席裴尔深入禁区，在乱军中得球，一记劲射，球从门右上方入网，首开纪录。主队输球后几次发动反攻，但都无功而返。上半时一比零结束。
    下半时，长春队踢来比较顺手，一反上半时的被动局面，变成一直压住客队打。但由于长春队运用中路突破多，攻势虽然频繁，但在客队的密集防守下，始终破门乏术，直至终场，未进一球。客队在下半时全力防守，前锋也无建树。一比零的比数维持到终场。
