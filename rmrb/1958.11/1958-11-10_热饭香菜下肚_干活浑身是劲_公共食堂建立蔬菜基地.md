Hot Meal and Coriander Down the Hatch - Working is Full of Energy!
Public Canteens Establish Vegetable Bases

According to Sichuan Daily: The more than three hundred public canteens of the Weiping People's Commune in Fushun County have all established their own vegetable bases.

In early October, when commune leaders discussed implementing the food supply system, they believed that the issue of vegetable supply for commune members was not a trivial matter. If this problem was not properly resolved, it would inevitably affect the labor enthusiasm of commune members and the production of the commune. Therefore, it was decided to establish vegetable bases. In addition to the vegetables needed by the urban population being produced uniformly by the commune's specialized vegetable production teams according to plan, the vegetables needed by commune members themselves would be supplied by the commune allocating a certain amount of land (2.5 fen per person) near the canteens, to be managed by the public canteens. The labor required for the public canteens to manage vegetables would generally be managed by the cooks. Larger canteens, depending on the situation, would have the production organization where the canteen was located designate special personnel or allocate a certain amount of labor to manage them. The fertilizer required for the commune members' vegetable bases would be uniformly specified by the commune in terms of fertilizer standards (one pig's worth of fertilizer supplied per mu) and supplied by the commune.

After the commune made such unified arrangements for vegetable bases, it not only guaranteed the vegetables needed by the urban population, but also adequately guaranteed the vegetables needed by the commune members themselves. The commune members were very satisfied. Everyone said: This will allow us to concentrate more on production.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha: The vegetable gardens near the public canteens of the Liyuan People's Commune in Yizhang County, Hunan, are lush and green everywhere. Because the vegetables grow well, this commune can eat more than one jin of vegetables per person per day on average. Some canteens also use the extra vegetables to exchange for fish and tofu, improving the lives of the commune members and greatly increasing their enthusiasm for labor production. At the same time, this commune also supplies more than 500 jin of vegetables to nearby factories and mines every day, meeting the needs of the workers.

Sufficient vegetable supply has also increased the variety of canteen dishes. Each canteen can generally offer two dishes per meal, and some can even make three or four dishes. Many canteens can make dishes suitable for the elderly and children.

Now, the entire commune has established specialized vegetable production teams based on canteens. The entire commune has 210 canteens, each organizing one team. The entire commune has planted more than 3,700 mu of vegetables, and the varieties are also complete, including Chinese cabbage, green vegetables, radishes, garlic, celery, spinach, and everything else. All professional teams implement a "four-package" system of contracted area, contracted output, contracted variety, and contracted vegetable delivery time.

The Liyuan People's Commune initially did not allocate a certain amount of manpower to manage the commune members' living problems; at the same time, many commune and team cadres also thought that after communization, the grain was supplied, and having rice to eat was all that mattered, so the canteens were generally poorly run. Later, after debate, by carefully calculating accounts and reasoning, after the ideology was unified, the commune decided to establish vegetable bases. The Party Committee designated Deputy Secretary Liao Silin to specifically lead this work, and each production brigade determined that a deputy captain would be specifically responsible. In this way, the vegetable production work of Liyuan Commune was also taken up.

According to Henan Daily: The public canteens of the Aiguo People's Commune in Suixian County, Henan Province, are better run than the small stoves, and the lives of commune members have all exceeded the dietary level of well-to-do middle peasants.

The public canteens of this commune, according to the principle of eating well and eating enough, often pay attention to adjusting life. The canteen combines coarse grains and refined grains very well, and commune members can eat a variety of fine noodles. Each production team has established vegetable planting groups of three to five people, and children, young adults, and the elderly can eat all kinds of delicious vegetables. In many public canteens, commune members can eat bread every day, each meal has four dishes, they can eat sweet rice in the morning, noodles at noon, and salty soup in the evening. In this way, the life of the public canteen completely surpasses the small stove of each household. According to the Tangzhuang Public Canteen, each person spends an average of 4.5 yuan per month on food and vegetables, which is 40% more than the local well-to-do middle peasants' 3.2 yuan per month. Therefore, not only the poor and lower-middle peasants are satisfied with the public canteens, but some well-to-do middle peasants also expressed their support. Commune member Zhang Kegong said: "Now, the life in the canteen is like celebrating the New Year every day."

In order to make the public canteens run even better in winter, the Aiguo Commune has taken effective measures. Some time ago, in order to ensure that commune members could eat hot meals, the commune built and newly built more than 400 simple dining halls. Each team arranged a steamed bun basket for every ten people, prepared a list for covering the rice and dishes, and built a heated kang for every twelve people to keep the soup basins warm. For the elderly and disabled, special personnel were designated to provide care. As for the storage of vegetables, each canteen pays even more attention. Now more than 200,000 jin of vegetables have been stored, and they are still being vigorously collected.

Strengthening the Party's leadership over public canteens, fully mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses, is the main experience of the well-run public canteens of the Aiguo People's Commune. In consolidating and improving the canteen, the commune's Party organization constantly strengthens political education for commune members, improves communist consciousness, and establishes the idea that everyone loves the canteen. The class policy was implemented, twenty-one impure management personnel were removed, and twenty-four Party cadres with good backgrounds, active work, progressive thinking, and certain cooking experience were selected to serve as accountants and cooks. In order to fully promote democracy, adhere to the mass line in everything, widely solicit the opinions of commune members, and constantly adjust life according to the opinions of commune members.

### 热饭香菜下肚　干活浑身是劲  公共食堂建立蔬菜基地

    热饭香菜下肚　干活浑身是劲
    公共食堂建立蔬菜基地
    据四川日报消息　富顺县卫坪人民公社的三百多个公共食堂，都建立了自己的蔬菜基地。
    10月上旬公社领导在讨论实行伙食供给制时，认为社员蔬菜供应问题不是件小事情，这个问题解决得不好，势必影响社员的劳动积极性和公社的生产。因此，确定建立蔬菜基地，除供应城镇人民所需的蔬菜由公社蔬菜专业生产队统一按计划生产外，社员自己所需蔬菜，均由公社划拨一定数量（每人二分五地）挨近食堂的土地，交由公共食堂负责经营。公共食堂经营蔬菜所需的劳力，一般是由炊事员兼管，较大的食堂，则根据情况，由食堂所在的生产组织，指定专人或调拨一定数量的劳力经营管理。社员蔬菜基地所需的肥料，则由公社统一规定用肥标准（一亩地供应一只猪的肥料）由社里供应。
    经过社里这样统一安排蔬菜基地后，不但保证了城镇人民所需要的蔬菜，而且，社员自己所需的菜蔬也得到了足够的保证，社员们十分满意。大家都说：这样就更能专心一意地搞生产了。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南宜章县栗源人民公社公共食堂附近的菜园里，到处是一片青葱。由于蔬菜长的好，这个社平均每个人一天能吃到蔬菜一斤多，部分食堂还用多余的蔬菜来换鱼和豆腐，改善了社员们的生活，大大提高社员劳动生产的积极性。同时，这个公社每天还向附近厂矿供应蔬菜五百多斤，满足工人们的需要。
    蔬菜供应充分，使食堂菜的品种也多了。每个食堂一般都能做到每餐两个菜，有的还能做三、四个菜。不少食堂都能做出适合老人和小孩需要的菜。
    现在，全公社都以食堂为单位成立了蔬菜生产专业队，全公社有二百一十个食堂，每个食堂组织一个。全社共种蔬菜三千七百余亩，品种也很齐，白菜、青菜、萝卜、大蒜、芹菜、菠菜等应有尽有。各专业队全部实行包面积、包产量、包花色品种、包出菜时间等四包制度。
    栗源人民公社开始没有抽出一定的力量来管社员们的生活问题；同时，很多社、队干部思想上也认为公社化后粮食实行供给制了，有了饭吃，蔬菜缺点有啥要紧，因此一般食堂都办得不好。后来经过辩论，通过算细账，摆道理，思想统一后，公社决定建立蔬菜基地，党委会指定副书记廖泗林专门领导这一工作，各生产大队确定由一个副队长来具体负责。这样，栗源社的蔬菜生产工作也就抓起来了。
    据河南日报消息　河南省睢县爱国人民公社公共食堂比小灶办得好，社员生活全部超过富裕中农伙食水平。
    这个社的公共食堂根据吃饱吃好的原则，经常注意调剂生活。食堂把粗粮和细粮搭配得很好，社员们可以吃到多种多样的细面饭。各个生产队都建立了三至五人的种菜小组，儿童、青壮年和老年人，都能吃到各种可口的蔬菜。在许多公共食堂里，社员们天天可以吃面包，每顿饭都有四样菜，早晨能吃上甜饭，中午吃到面条，晚上喝到咸汤。这样，公共食堂的生活完全胜过一家一户的小灶。据汤庄公共食堂了解，每人每月平均吃饭菜合四元五角，比当地富裕中农每月三元二角多40％。因此，不但贫农和下中农对公共食堂满意，就是有些富裕中农也表示拥护。社员张克功说：现在食堂生活天天都像过年一样”。
    为了使公共食堂在冬天办得更好，爱国公社已采取了有效措施。前些时，社里为了保证社员都能吃到热饭，已修建和新建四百多间简易饭厅。各队按每十人编好一个馍篓，制好了盖饭菜的单子，每十二人垒好了一个热炕，汤盆放在炕上保温。对于老年人和残废人，还指定专人作好奉养。至于蔬菜的储备，各个食堂更是重视。现在已储备了二十多万斤蔬菜，仍在大力采集。
    加强党对公共食堂的领导，充分发动群众依靠群众，是爱国人民公社公共食堂办得好的主要经验。在巩固提高食堂中，公社党组织不断对社员加强政治教育，提高共产主义觉悟，树立人人爱食堂的思想。贯彻了阶级政策，清除了不纯的管理人员二十一人，选拔了成份好、工作积极、思想进步，并有一定做饭经验的二十四名党员干部，充任了会计和炊事员。为了充分发扬民主，事事走群众路线，广泛吸收社员意见，根据社员意见，不断调剂生活。
