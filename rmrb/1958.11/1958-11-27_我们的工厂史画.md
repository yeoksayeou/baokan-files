    Our Factory History Paintings
    Fu Renmin, Worker of Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Mill
    I've loved drawing since I was little, but in the old society, like millions of other workers and peasants, I was a poor child from a peasant family. Just to survive, I entered a Japanese-owned yarn factory at the age of nine. I couldn't even get enough to eat, so drawing was out of the question. It was unthinkable.
    After liberation, thanks to the leadership and care of the Party, I had the opportunity to study art.
    This April, under the direction of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, a factory history compilation and painting movement was launched in various factories. The purpose was to conduct a profound socialist education for the broad masses of workers and staff, clarifying for whom they were working ideologically. By recalling the development and growth of the workers and comparing their past and present lives, the aim was to raise awareness, establish and consolidate communist thought, and spark a high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production. I, along with amateur art workers and all the staff in the factory, participated in the factory history painting work. Under the leadership of the factory Party committee, we completed more than 300 paintings in over twenty days and exhibited them in the factory.
    Many employees were deeply moved after seeing the exhibition of factory history paintings, often bursting into tears, expressing their deep hatred for the old society, their greater love for socialism and communism, and their hundredfold support for the Party's leadership. As someone wrote in their comments after viewing: "When we saw the tragic lives of workers before liberation, we shed tears of anger; when we saw that workers had become masters after liberation and the Party's care for us, we shed tears of excitement. Many of us shed both kinds of tears." For example, Zhong Yuqin, an old fine yarn worker, said excitedly after seeing the exhibition, "I entered the Japanese yarn factory in my teens, where I was beaten and scolded, living a life like a beast of burden. Today, I am the master of the factory, living a happy life. We must not forget our roots, we must stand firm and always follow the Party." Our factory history paintings played a significant role among all the employees of the factory, and therefore new leaps forward in production continued to emerge.
    Painting the factory history was also a great ideological education for me. I deeply realized that the happy life we have today was earned through the arduous struggles of countless old workers under the leadership of the Party. How difficult it was! Today we can live happily, and we can pick up our paintbrushes to paint our past history, paint our present happy life, and paint the construction of our motherland. This is truly the greatest happiness. Therefore, we must never forget the past and must work hard to complete all the tasks assigned to us by the Party.
    Painting the factory history has also improved my artistic skills a lot, and made me truly realize the power generated by the combination of art and politics. At the same time, I have also gained many new experiences in creation. Especially when I was painting the history of the Japanese occupation period and the Kuomintang period, such as workers being dismissed for disability, strikes for a bag of flour, and other struggles, old workers Zhang Ruiyuan, Xing Baokai, and others gesticulated and specifically introduced the time and place of each event and the expressions of the characters at that time. With their help, I learned about many heroic stories of struggle and also learned that the clothes worn by workers at that time were not work clothes but patched clothes made at home, and that the workers' lunch boxes were not the current lunch boxes but broken small buckets. This not only solved my creative problems but also gave me a deep class education. (Attached picture)

    我们的工厂史画
    天津棉纺六厂工人　傅仁民
    我从小就喜欢画画，但在旧社会，我和千百万工农劳动者一样，是贫农出身的穷孩子，为了活下去，从九岁我就进入了日本纱厂，连饭都吃不上，哪里还谈得上画画，这是不敢想的事。
    解放后由于党的领导和关怀，才使我有了机会学习美术。
    今年4月间在天津市党委的指示下，各工厂掀起一个编绘工厂史运动，其目的是向广大职工进行一次深刻的社会主义教育，在思想上明确为谁劳动。通过回忆工人的发展、成长的过程和今昔生活的对比，来提高觉悟、树立与巩固共产主义思想，掀起生产大跃进高潮。我和厂内业余美术工作者及全体职工一起参加工厂史的绘画工作。在厂党委的领导下经过二十几天，便完成了三百多幅画，并在厂内展出。
    很多的职工看完工厂史画的展览，心情都十分激动，声泪俱下，表现了对旧社会的刻骨痛恨，对社会主义共产主义更加热爱，对党领导百倍拥护。正像有人在观后感里写道：当我们看到解放前工人的悲惨生活遭遇时，愤恨地流下了泪；当看到解放后工人成了主人，党对我们的关怀时又兴奋地流下了泪。我们许多人都流下了这两次泪。例如细纱老工人锺玉琴看完后激动的说，我十几岁就进了日本纱厂，挨打受骂，过着牛马生活，今天成了工厂的主人，过着美满的日子。我们可不要忘本，我们一定要站稳立场，永远跟着党走。我们的厂史画在全厂职工中起了很大的作用，因此生产上不断出现新的跃进高潮。
    通过绘画工厂史，对我更是最大的一次思想教育。我深深地体会到今天的幸福生活，是过去无数老工人在党领导下经过了艰苦斗争才换来的，这多么不容易呵！今天我们能幸福的生活，并能拿起画笔画自己过去的历史，画现在幸福生活，画祖国的建设，这真是最大的幸福。所以决不能忘了过去，一定要好好的工作，完成党交给我们的一切任务。
    通过绘画厂史，使我在美术上也提高了一大步，使我真正认识到艺术结合政治所产生的力量。同时在创作上也有不少新的体会。特别是我在绘画日本时期和国民党时期的历史时，如工人因残废被开除，为了一袋面的罢工等斗争生活，老工人张瑞元、邢宝凯等同志都指手画脚，具体地介绍了每一件事情发生的时间地点和当时人物的表情。经过他们的帮助，我才知道当时许多英勇斗争的故事，也知道了工人穿的衣服不是工服而是家做的破衣服，工人的提盒不是现在的提盒而是破小桶，……。这不仅解决了我的创作问题，也使我受了很深的阶级教育。（附图片）
