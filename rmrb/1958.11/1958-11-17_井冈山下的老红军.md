    Old Red Army Soldiers Under Jinggang Mountain
    By our reporter Mei Guobao

    The Red Army Steel Plant in Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, was built in just over twenty days by thirty-six demobilized and returned-to-farming Long March veterans and sixty-one second-class disabled veterans who were gloriously wounded during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War.

          The Second Long March
    After the Yongxin County Party Committee conveyed the Party Central Committee's great call to double steel production, all the old Red Army soldiers responded enthusiastically. The next day, September 2nd, they held a rally in the county town to march on steel and fight for steel. The speeches at the meeting were very enthusiastic, and the mood was very high. Long March veterans Liu Jinbiao and others unanimously emphasized in their speeches: In the past, in order to go north to resist Japan and to achieve victory in the revolutionary war, we began the world-shaking 25,000-li Long March in 1934; now, marching on steel and fighting for steel is a continuation of the Long March for us, our second Long March in history. And the Long March of the past was precisely for today's "Long March" – breaking through the steel barrier and accelerating our country's socialist construction. As soon as the meeting ended, they didn't even go home to get their clothes, and formed a Red Army Steel Company and immediately rushed to the construction site.

    In order to strive to produce iron by the end of September, ninety-seven old Red Army soldiers worked day and night in the desolate mountains and fields. Although they were old and weak, and had physical disabilities, no one bowed their heads to difficulties, no one complained, and all persevered to the end. Kuang Shunxiu, who had been wounded three times during the Long March and is still extremely weak due to excessive blood loss at the time, was truly full of energy. He mined ore one moment and dismantled bricks the next, doing everything. Others saw that he was too tired and tried to stop him and persuade him to rest, but it was no use. Lan Shengyi, whose left hand was blown off in a battle during the Long March, had difficulty using both hands, so he carried the bricks that his comrades had picked up to the road. Tang Zhengfu, who was just a young kid during the Long March, has always been an optimist, and now he is even more energetic, talking and laughing, and his laughter can be heard everywhere. When the battle entered its third day, some people felt extremely tired and lay on the ground to rest, he opened the chatterbox. He said with a smile: "What is this 'Long March'? When we are hungry, we have food to eat, and when we are tired, we rest. Compared to the 25,000-li Long March, it can be said to be too happy. Red Army soldiers, do you think so?" As soon as he finished speaking, the atmosphere immediately livened up, and some comrades who had gone through the Long March and reached Yan'an victoriously sat on the grass and talked about the scenes of the Long March that year; while comrades who had been wounded during the Long March or before the Long March lay on the grass and listened quietly. In this way, in seven days and seven nights, they picked up more than 70,000 bricks, more than 6,000 kilograms of ore, and also built two furnace foundations.

        Li Ruifeng on Crutches
    One rainy autumn night, Li Kaisheng, the instructor of the Red Army Steel Plant, introduced me to the deeds of the storekeeper Li Ruifeng. Li Ruifeng is known as the "dedicated shock team member" in the ore processing team. The instructor said: "Comrade Li Ruifeng was injured in a battle when the Red Army attacked Yongyang in 1930, and since then he has only had one left foot. After the Red Army went north, under the cover of the masses, he continued to wage a tenacious struggle against the enemy. Since liberation, in every movement, he has always taken the lead in responding to the calls of the Party and the government, becoming a vanguard on all fronts, and has been repeatedly rated as a model disabled soldier and has also attended the provincial conference of disabled soldiers' activists; as soon as he arrived at the steel plant, he asked to join the shock team. He rushed to do everything, carrying charcoal, dismantling bricks, mining ore, and digging mud…"

    I asked anxiously: "With only one foot, and running around on this mountain with crutches, isn't it very inconvenient?"
    The instructor nodded and said: "That's right! Because he fell several times while carrying charcoal, his head and hands were injured, but he applied some ointment and continued to work, and he wouldn't listen to persuasion to rest. He always said: 'To march on steel, we must race against time, and if we rest just because we have a scratch, that won't work!' We felt that this couldn't go on for a long time, and after discussing it with the higher authorities, we decided to transfer him to be the storekeeper of the plant."
    I said, "Is he willing?"
    The instructor said with a smile: "Don't worry, he can't be unwilling. First, we talked about the importance of the storage work, and then we told him the opinions of the higher authorities. He is the deputy secretary of the Party branch, can he bargain? He didn't bargain, and he happily took on the storage work. However, after he figured out the rules of the storage work, he always tried his best to finish the work that should be done every morning, and in the afternoon and evening, he would hobble to the ore processing team on crutches, sit there and knock ore, knocking one or two thousand kilograms every day, and more than ten thousand kilograms in the last few days.

      Three People Who Are Not Very Disciplined
    As soon as you enter the Red Army Steel Plant, it's like arriving at a military unit, with a high degree of organization and discipline. In the entire company, there are fuel teams, ore teams, processing teams, mechanical teams, furnace teams, batching teams, and shock teams, truly well-organized and not chaotic at all. Work and rest, as soon as the whistle blows, everyone acts immediately. Discipline and regulations are well observed, just like the old Eighth Route Army observing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. But in such a company, there appeared three people who were not very disciplined, often making the company commander shake his head and sigh, and even get angry. These three people are old Red Army veterans Liu Nankai, Ma Wende, and Hu Dingxian. They are all nearly sixty years old. During the Long March, Liu Nankai and Hu Dingxian's left hands were injured, and Ma Wende's right hand was injured. Due to excessive blood loss at the time, their bodies are now very weak. It wouldn't be right to say that they completely disregarded discipline. They were always the first to arrive at the construction site and the last to leave, never being late or leaving early. The factory director had repeatedly ordered: "All elderly, weak, and physically disabled people should rest at home at night and are not allowed to go to the construction site." Ma Wende said, why can others work the night shift, but we can't? The three of them were very unconvinced. So, whenever a night shock battle was organized, they were always the first to arrive at the construction site, waiting there to ask the company commander for tasks. Whether the company commander criticized them or got angry, if he didn't give them tasks, they just wouldn't leave. When there was really no way, they would even carry out ideological mobilization with the company commander. They often said: Company commander, didn't you say that building the motherland needs steel, and defeating the invaders needs steel, and that our old Red Army veterans should go all out, overcome difficulties, march on steel, and fight for steel? But, when organizing shock battles, you want us to lie in bed, how can that work? The company commander had no choice but to agree to their requests.

      Laying Railroad Tracks to Welcome Chairman Mao
    One evening, when everyone was resting, Long Yongxian, a sixty-one-year-old Long March cadre, talked to me about his thoughts. He said that he was determined to smelt more steel, use the steel he smelted to build our country, and build a railway from Nanchang to Jinggang Mountain to bring Chairman Mao to Jinggang Mountain, to visit their steel plant. I quickly asked him: "Old comrade, you must miss Chairman Mao very much, have you met Chairman Mao before?" He immediately said excitedly: "I have seen him, I have seen him once. That was back in August 1928. At that time, when Chairman Mao went from Jinggang Mountain to Ruijin, passing by Litian, I was the first to greet Chairman Mao. At that time, I was a member of the township farmers' association. I took Chairman Mao's hand and led him around the village. Chairman Mao walked and asked me: Have the seedlings in the village been distributed? What are the opinions of the masses? I said, the seedlings have all been distributed, and the masses are very happy, but the two local tyrants have both run away. Chairman Mao said with a smile, it's good that the seedlings have been distributed, it doesn't matter if the local tyrants have run away, they can always be caught back. Chairman Mao stayed in my village that night." At this time, Long Yongxian, immersed in happy memories, excitedly told me: "Chairman Mao went from Jinggang Mountain to Ruijin thirty years ago on foot, now I want to speed up steelmaking, and use the steel we smelt to lay a railway from Nanchang to Jinggang Mountain, so that when Chairman Mao comes here again, he can take the train."

    井冈山下的老红军
    本报记者　梅国宝
    江西永新县红军钢铁厂，是三十六名解甲归农的长征老战士和六十一名在第二次国内革命战争中光荣负伤的二等残废军人，在二十多天中建立起来的。
          第二次长征
    在永新县委传达了党中央关于把钢的产量翻一番的伟大号召后，全县老红军立即热烈响应。第二天，也就是9月2日，他们在县城举行了向钢铁进军，为钢铁而战的誓师大会。会上发言非常踊跃，情绪非常高涨，长征战士刘金彪等八人在发言中一致强调指出：过去，为了北上抗日，为了取得革命战争的胜利，我们在1934年开始了震动全世界的二万五千里长征；现在，向钢铁进军，为钢铁而战，对我们来说是长征的继续，是我们历史上的第二次长征。而过去的长征，正是为了今天的“长征”——攻破钢铁关，加速我国的社会主义建设。会议一结束，他们连衣服都不回家拿，就组成了一个红军钢铁连，立即奔赴工地。
    为了争取在9月底出铁，九十七名老红军战士在荒山野岭中，夜以继日地进行着忘我的劳动。尽管他们年老体弱，手足残废，但是没有一个人向困难低头，没有一个人叫苦，都是一直坚持到底。曾经在长征途中三次负伤，因当时流血过多，到现在仍极瘦弱的旷顺秀，真是干劲冲天，他一时挖矿石，一时拆砖头，什么都干，别人看他太累了，左拦右劝要他休息，也没有用。在长征战斗中被炸掉左手的蓝生意，因为双手不便，他就把同志们拾好的砖块，挑到马路上去。在长征中还是小鬼的汤正福，一直是个乐观派，现在更是干劲冲天，有说有笑，到处都可以听到他的笑声。当战斗进入第三天，有些人感到极度疲倦，躺在地上休息的时候，他就打开了话匣子。笑着说：“这次‘长征’算得什么呢？饿了有饭吃，累了就休息，比起二万五千里长征，可以说是太幸福了。红军战士们，你们说对吗？”他的话音一落，空气马上活跃起来了，一些经过长征，胜利到达延安的同志，就坐在草地上谈起当年长征的情景；而在长征途中或在长征以前负过伤的同志，则躺在草地上静静地听着。就这样，他们在七日七夜中，拾回了七万多块砖头、六千多斤矿石，还打好了二个炉基。
        架拐棍的李瑞风
    在一个秋雨连绵的夜晚，红军钢铁厂的指导员李开生向我介绍了保管员李瑞风的事迹。李瑞风在矿石加工班被称为加工班里的“专用突击队员”。指导员说：“李瑞风同志在1930年红军攻打永阳的一次战役中，受了伤，从那时候起，他就只有一只左脚。红军北上后，在群众的掩护下，他一直同敌人进行着顽强的斗争。解放以来，在每个运动中，他总是带头响应党和政府的号召，成为各条战线上的尖兵，多次被评为荣军模范，还出席过全省荣军积极分子大会；他一到钢铁厂，就要求参加突击队。抬木炭、拆砖头、打矿石、挖泥土，什么都抢着干……”
    我着急地问：“一只脚，架着拐杖，在这个山地上跑来跑去，多不方便？
    指导员点了点头说：“可不是！因为抬木炭他跌倒了好几次，头和手都跌伤了，但他敷上点药膏又继续干，劝他休息，他也不听。他总是说：‘向钢铁进军就要分秒必争，擦破点皮就要休息，那还行？’我们觉得长期这样下去不行，经过和上级研究，就决定把他调作厂的保管员，”
    我说：“他愿意？”
    指导员笑着说：“这你放心，他不能不愿意的。开始我们把保管工作的重要性一谈，然后将上级的意见告诉他。他呢，是党支部的副书记，还能讲价钱？他的确没有讲价钱，很高兴地担任保管工作了。可是，当他摸清保管工作的规律以后，就总是千方百计地争取每天上午把应该做的工作做完，下午和晚上，就架着拐杖，向矿石加工班一溜，坐在那里敲矿石，每天总要敲一两千斤，最近几天敲到了一万多斤。
      三个不大守纪律的人
    一进红军钢铁厂，就像到了部队一样，这里有着高度的组织性和纪律性。在整个连队中，有燃料班、矿石班、加工班、机械班、炉前班、配料班，还有突击队，真是组织严密，一点不乱。工作、休息，哨子一响，立即行动。纪律和制度都遵守的很好，就像老八路遵守三大纪律八项注意一样。但是就在这样的连队里，却出现了三个不大遵守纪律的人，常常弄得连长摇头叹气，甚至大发脾气。这三个人就是红军老战士刘南开、马文德和胡定先。他们都快六十岁了。在长征中，刘南开、胡定先的左手都被打坏了，马文德则是右手被打坏了，由于当时流血过多，以致现在身体都很弱。说他们完全不遵守纪律，那也不对，每次上工，他们总是头一批到工地，最后一批离开工地，没有迟到早退过。厂长三令五申地说过：“凡年老体弱，手脚不便的人，夜间在家休息，不准到工地上去。”马文德却说别人能打夜班，为什么我们就不能？三个人很不服气。于是，每当夜间组织突击战的时候，他们总是最先去到达工地，等在那里向连长要任务。连长批评也好，发脾气也好，不给任务，就是不走。在实在没有办法的时候，他们还要向连长进行思想动员呢。他们常常说：连长，你不是说建设祖国需要钢铁，打击侵略者需要钢铁，我们红军老战士要鼓足干劲、克服困难，向钢铁进军，为钢铁而战吗？但是，在组织突击战的时候，你却要我们躺在被窝里，那怎么能行？连长没法只好答应他们的请求。
      铺起铁路迎接毛主席
    在一个傍晚，当大家休息的时候，六十一岁的长征干部龙永先向我谈起了他的心事。他说，他决心多炼钢铁，用自己炼出的钢铁，建设我们的国家，并从南昌到井冈山铺起一条铁路，把毛主席接到井冈山，接到他们的钢铁厂来看看。我忙问他：“老同志，很想毛主席了吧，见过毛主席没有？”他立刻兴奋地说：“见过，见过一次。那还是1928年8月间的事情。当时毛主席从井冈山到瑞金，路过澧田时，我是第一个上前迎接毛主席的。那时我是乡农协委员。我拉着毛主席的手，带他沿村子走了一圈。毛主席边走边问我：村子的青苗分了没有？群众有什么意见？我说，青苗都分了，群众很高兴，只是二个土豪都逃走了。毛主席笑着说，青苗分了就好，土豪逃走了没有关系，总是可以抓回来的。当晚毛主席就住在我的村子里。”这时，龙永先浸沉在幸福的回忆里兴奋地告诉我：“毛主席三十年前从井冈山到瑞金，是用双脚走去的，现在我要加紧炼钢铁，用我们自己炼的钢铁从南昌到井冈山铺上铁路，毛主席再来这里时，就可以坐火车了。”
