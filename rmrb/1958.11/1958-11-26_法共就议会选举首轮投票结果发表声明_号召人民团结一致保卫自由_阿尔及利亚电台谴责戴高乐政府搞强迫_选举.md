Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 24th. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued the following statement tonight regarding the results of the first round of the French parliamentary elections:

    The French Communist Party obtained nearly four million votes, and it remains the largest party in France.
    However, there is now a rampant trend of reaction and fascism. The French Communist Party has shown itself to be a powerful force against reactionaries and war. It has always been the main bastion of democracy.
    The anti-communist attitude of the Socialist Party leaders has once again harmed the interests of the working class, democracy, and the interests of France.
    The most important task at present is to unite all workers and republican forces to block the fascist threat.
    The reactionary and fascist majority elected in mainland France in collusion with Soustelle, coupled with the extremist group of Massu, will pose a serious threat to French politics and will further worsen the state of poverty, because the entire burden of war and crisis is borne by the working masses.
    Therefore, it is necessary to safeguard the demands of laborers, workers, farmers, civil servants, staff, craftsmen, and small merchants, etc., who are under the threat of big capital.
    It is necessary to strive for peace in Algeria so that extremists cannot succeed.
    It is necessary to defend freedom and the republic from the dangers of fascism.
    Therefore, all republicans, communists, socialists, radicals, Catholics, and those who abstained yesterday who are facing the threat of fascism today must unite their forces and vote for the candidates of the French Communist Party in the second round of voting, and vote for the candidates who benefit from the abstention of the Communist Party candidates, because the latter also oppose despotism and oppose the rampant actions of the reactionaries.

Xinhua News Agency, November 25th. The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station condemned on the 24th the French De Gaulle government for insisting on holding "elections" for the French National Assembly in Algeria on November 30th to cover up its bloody colonial rule.

    The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station said that the French government is forcing Algerians to hold "elections" on November 30th without any reason. "This kind of 'election' forced upon Algerians by barbaric means and acts of terror only illustrates the brutality and shamelessness of the French."
    The radio station pointed out: "The Algerian people have unanimously responded to the call of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. They refuse to nominate any genuine Algerian candidate and will resist the elections under possible conditions. This shows that the Algerian people are fully determined to strive for national liberation and the freedom and independence of the people. However, the French colonial government dreams of keeping it (Algeria) under colonial enslavement.
    "Some facts are that no one can change. History shows that colonialists will fail, and enslaved people will be liberated."
    The radio station accused the United Nations of being slow to take effective measures to resolve the Algerian issue. It said that the United Nations is "weakly condemning all the crimes of the French colonialists in Algeria, which is beneficial to the French government."
    The radio station demanded that the United Nations intervene in the Algerian issue and take measures to sanction the French colonialists who rudely violate the United Nations Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights.

    阿尔及利亚电台谴责戴高乐政府搞强迫“选举”
    新华社巴黎24日电　法国共产党中央委员会政治局今天晚上就法国议会选举第一轮投票结果发表声明如下：
    法国共产党获得将近四百万张票，它仍然是法国第一大党。
    可是现在出现了反动的和法西斯的猖獗趋势。法国共产党表现出是反对反动派和战争的一支强大的力量。它始终是民主的主要堡垒。
    社会党领导人的反共态度，再一次起了危害工人阶级利益、危害民主和法国的利益的作用。
    当前最重大的任务，就是团结一切工人和共和力量来堵塞法西斯威胁。
    在法国本土选出的同苏斯戴尔串通勾结的反动和法西斯多数派，加上马絮的极端分子集团，将对法国政治进行严重的威胁，并且将使穷困状态进一步恶化，因为战争和危机的全部重担都压在劳动群众身上。
    因此，必须维护处于大资本威胁之下的劳动者、工人、农民、公务员、职员、手工业者和小商人等的权利要求。
    必须争取在阿尔及利亚实现和平，使极端分子不能得逞。
    必须保卫自由和共和国免遭法西斯主义的危害。
    因此，今天面临着法西斯威胁的所有共和分子、共产党人、社会党人、激进党人、天主教徒以及昨天弃权的人们，必须团结自己的力量并且在第二轮投票时投法国共产党候选人的票，投那些因为共产党候选人弃权而得益的竞选人的票，因为后者也反对专制制度、反对反动派的猖狂行径。
    新华社25日讯　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”广播电台24日谴责法国戴高乐政府硬要在11月30日在阿尔及利亚举行法国国民议会“选举”以掩盖其血腥的殖民统治。
     “阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台说，法国政府毫无理由地强迫阿尔及利亚人在11月30日举行“选举”，“这种用野蛮手段和恐怖行为强迫阿尔及利亚人接受的‘选举’，只说明法国人的残暴和无耻”。
    电台指出：“阿尔及利亚人民已经一致响应阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的号召，他们拒绝提出任何一名真正的阿尔及利亚候选人，而且将在可能的条件下抵制选举。这表明阿尔及利亚人民有充分决心争取全国的解放和人民的自由、独立。而法国殖民政府却幻想使它（阿尔及利亚）继续留在殖民奴役之下。
    “有一些事实是任何人无力改变的。历史表明殖民主义者将要失败，而被奴役的人民将获得解放。”
    电台指责联合国迟迟不采取有效措施来解决阿尔及利亚问题。它说，联合国“软弱无力地谴责法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚的一切罪行，这样就对法国政府有利。”
    电台要求联合国过问阿尔及利亚问题，并且采取措施制裁粗暴地违反联合国宪章和人权宣言的法国殖民者。
