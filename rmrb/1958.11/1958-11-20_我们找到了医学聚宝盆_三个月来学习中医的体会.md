    We Found a Medical Treasure Trove
    --Experiences of Studying Traditional Chinese Medicine for Three Months
    A joint discussion by Ge Qinsheng, Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lei Haipeng, Associate Professor of Pharmacology, and She Mingpeng, Lecturer of Pathology, all from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Ge Qinsheng wrote the article.
    We have been studying traditional Chinese medicine at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine for three months. During these three months, we truly feel like we have found a medical treasure trove. We have discovered that traditional Chinese medicine is truly rich and colorful, and it has greatly inspired us in our thinking. Many advantages of traditional Chinese medicine are precisely what Western medicine lacks or simply does not have. For example, the theory of meridians and the acupuncture treatment are something that Western medicine does not have. Traditional Chinese medicine's analysis and observation of diseases are in many ways more thorough and detailed than Western medicine. In terms of treatment methods and effectiveness, the National Exhibition of Pharmaceutical and Health Technology Revolution has powerfully illustrated this point: many problems that Western medicine cannot solve are cured by traditional Chinese medicine. Although we have only been studying for a short time and our understanding of traditional Chinese medicine is still superficial, based on our initial experiences, we believe that traditional Chinese medicine is a great science.
    Traditional Chinese medicine has very high curative effects and enjoys a high prestige among the broad masses of the people. It is not just some fragmented experiences as we originally imagined. In fact, traditional Chinese medicine has a complete theoretical system. Influenced by the simple dialectical materialism of the time, the ancients used the theory of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements to explain the complex relationship between humans and nature and the relationship between the various parts of the human body.
    After thousands of years of continuous enrichment and development, a set of rules that conform to the objective development of things has been summarized, and it has been summarized into the theoretical system of traditional Chinese medicine through countless practices.
    Traditional Chinese medicine can solve many problems that Western medicine cannot solve because it has some unique theoretical systems. Different from Western medicine, syndrome differentiation and treatment is one of them. Traditional Chinese medicine treats diseases very flexibly. It is based on the symptoms shown by the patient, summarized and analyzed according to the Eight Principles, and then formulates the treatment principles. The symptoms of any disease are ever-changing, but they cannot be separated from the eight principles of exterior/interior, cold/heat, deficiency/excess, and yin/yang. Taking the most common cold as an example, the human body can experience fear of cold and fever after catching a cold, which is an exterior symptom. However, at the same time as the fear of cold and fever, a patient with sweat is called exterior deficiency, and a patient without sweat is called exterior excess. In the different situations of exterior deficiency and exterior excess, although it is the same exterior symptom of a cold, the treatment methods are completely different. Traditional Chinese medicine is so thorough and meticulous in dealing with symptoms, paying attention to extremely small differences. For example, if one suffers from dampness and exhibits exterior symptoms, such as heaviness, pain, and fever, the diaphoresis method can be used. However, if one suffers from dampness and exhibits interior symptoms such as diarrhea, the diaphoresis method cannot be used and the warming method needs to be used. Although the causes are the same, the location of the symptom manifestation is different, and the treatment method is also different. The evolution of the Eight Principles in clinical practice is intricate and complex. There are exterior deficiency and interior excess, upper cold and lower heat, exterior heat and interior cold, etc., and even true and false differences, such as cold limbs (cold appearance), thirst and dry mouth (heat appearance). The cold appearance on the outside is false, while the heat appearance is true. If heat medicine is applied according to the cold appearance, it can aggravate the condition or even cause death. If it is clearly distinguished and cold medicine is applied, it can have an immediate effect.
    Western medicine is often helpless in the face of diseases that cannot be diagnosed, but in traditional Chinese medicine, regardless of whether the disease is caused by bacteria, viruses, tumors, or functional disorders, a treatment plan can be formulated based on the symptoms through the analysis and summarization of the Eight Principles. The appearance of symptoms must have its pathological and physiological basis. Symptoms can indicate the attributes in the Eight Principles, can indicate the location of the disease, the depth of the disease, the progress and regression of the disease, the rise and fall of evil and righteousness, the strength of the patient's resistance, and the severity of the pathogenic power. Analyzing and summarizing according to this method is extremely scientific. Using this summarization method, the same Western medical diagnosis may be treated with many different methods due to different symptoms. For example, in the treatment of Japanese encephalitis, different treatment methods are needed due to different symptom manifestations. Being able to carefully classify, pay attention to minute changes, and give correct treatment will have a very significant therapeutic effect. Conversely, different Western medical diagnoses may have the same treatment method due to the same symptoms and mechanisms of occurrence. For example, rashes in different febrile diseases can be treated with the same principle, with some additions and subtractions in the prescriptions to achieve the therapeutic effect. This is clearly different from Western medicine's approach of using one drug to treat a certain bacterium or virus. Comprehensively analyzing symptoms according to the Eight Principles and then formulating a comprehensive treatment plan is the method of treatment based on syndrome differentiation. This treatment method is completely different from the symptomatic treatment of treating a headache by treating the head and treating a footache by treating the foot.
    The prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine are often more complex and are constantly changing, which is also based on the analysis of symptoms and their changes. Symptoms are divided into main symptoms and concurrent symptoms, so different drugs in the prescription have different missions.
    The prominent guiding ideology of traditional Chinese medicine in treatment is reflected in curing the patient rather than treating the disease. Whether starting from the physiological or pathological point of view, traditional Chinese medicine always regards the human as a unified whole, clearly pointing out that all parts of the human body are interconnected and mutually influential. If a disease in one organ is not treated in time, it will affect another organ. For example, if the liver is diseased, it will affect the spleen and stomach. Therefore, after a liver disease is discovered, the spleen and stomach should be protected to prevent the spleen and stomach from becoming diseased. In addition to emphasizing the unified integrity of the human being, traditional Chinese medicine also attaches great importance to the impact of the external environment on the human body. There are different health preservation methods in different seasons. Abnormal climates can lead to diseases. The same disease may use different drugs or different treatment methods in areas with different natural conditions. This highly scientific system of thought has been circulating in the system of traditional Chinese medicine for at least two thousand years. In addition to the concept of holism, a more active aspect of traditional Chinese medicine in treating diseases is to improve the patient's health. Traditional Chinese medicine treatment focuses on the cause of the disease on the one hand, but on the other hand, it pays more attention to the patient, improving the patient's resistance or correcting the pathological state to tend towards the physiological state, which is called "supporting the righteous" (扶正), and overcoming pathogenic factors is called "expelling the evil" (驱邪). Traditional Chinese medicine believes that expelling evil is important, but supporting the righteous is more important. The purpose of traditional Chinese medicine treatment is not only to rely on the power of the medicine to directly eliminate the disease and eradicate the symptoms, but also to focus on directly using the power of the medicine to increase the patient's resistance, restore natural healing ability, assist the human body's physiological functions, and indirectly expel the disease to eliminate the symptoms. This guiding ideology is obviously a more active aspect. And Western medicine is very lacking in this aspect.
    Over the years, Western medicine has done a lot of work targeting pathogens and has achieved many results. However, simply being trapped in the circle of pathogens has also hindered the further development of medical science. Therefore, over the years, a large amount of manpower and material resources have been invested, but many diseases have not been resolved, and many diseases still seriously threaten people's lives and health. The large number of facts published in the recent National Pharmaceutical and Health Technology Revolution Exhibition and newspapers have fully illustrated that many incurable diseases that Western medicine cannot cure are cured by traditional Chinese medicine, problems that Western medicine has no solution for are solved by traditional Chinese medicine, and some diseases that Western medicine can cure can be treated better by traditional Chinese medicine. These have pointed out a new direction for us. After studying traditional Chinese medicine, not only has our way of thinking changed, but also we have further realized the necessity of the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, so as to further promote traditional Chinese medicine and establish a new medical ideology system; for many currently unsolved diseases such as tumors, hypertension, endocrine, functional disorders, etc., there are not only broad research prospects in the future, but also will be fundamentally solved in a not too long period of time.
    The Party put forward the policy of promoting traditional Chinese medicine long ago, and also put forward the idea of Western medicine doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine long ago, but due to the bourgeois education we have received for many years, we have serious ideas of favoring Western medicine and belittling traditional Chinese medicine, and we cannot well understand the Party's guidelines and policies. Through the education of the rectification movement and this study, we have further realized that traditional Chinese medicine has such a high curative effect, but it has not been further developed for many years; we have realized that only the Party cares about the health of the people, and only under the leadership of the Communist Party can it be possible to unite traditional Chinese and Western medicine, integrate traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and further guarantee the health of the people. The task of integrating traditional Chinese and Western medicine and creating a new medical system is arduous. If we resolutely obey the leadership of the Party, implement the Party's policies, and add the strength of the masses, this arduous task will definitely be accomplished. We deeply realize that only by studying harder and working hard can we launch brilliant "satellites" in the field of medicine in a not too long time.

    我们找到了医学聚宝盆
    ——三个月来学习中医的体会
    中国医学科学院  妇产科副教授葛秦生、药理系副教授雷海鹏、病理系讲师佘铭鹏共同讨论，葛秦生执笔
    我们到中医研究院来学习中医，已经有三个月了。在这三个月的过程中，我们确是像找到了一个医学上的聚宝盆，发现祖国医学真是丰富多彩，给我们在思想上的启发是很大的。中医的很多优点，也正是西医方面极为贫乏的，或是根本没有的。例如经络的学说、针灸疗法就是西医所没有的，中医对于疾病的分析观察在很多方面比西医深入细致。治疗的方法和效果方面，全国的医药卫生技术革命展览会已十分有力地说明了这一点，很多西医所不能解决的问题，中医治好了。虽然我们学习的时间很短，对于中医的认识还是很肤浅的，但仅就我们初步的体会，我们认为祖国医学是一门伟大的科学。
    中医有着很高的疗效，它在广大人民群众中间享有很高的威信。它不是我们原来所想像的只是一些片断的经验，事实上祖国医学有一套完整的理论体系，古人在当时的朴素的辩证唯物论的哲学思想影响下运用了阴阳五行的学说来阐明复杂的人与自然的关系和人体各部的相互关系。
    经过几千年来不断的丰富与发展，总结了一套合乎事物客观发展的规律，并且已通过无数次的实践而总结成为祖国医学的理论体系。
    中医之所以能解决很多西医所不能解决的问题，还因为它有一些独特的理论体系。不同于西医的，辩证论治就是其中之一。中医治病是极为灵活的，是依据病人所表现的症状，根据八纲来归纳分析，然后制订治疗的原则。任何疾病的症状千变万化，都离不开表里、寒热、虚实、阴阳这八个纲领。以最普通的感冒为例，人体在受感冒后就可以发生怕冷、发烧，这也就是表症，但是在怕冷、发烧的同时，病人有汗的就称为表虚，无汗的就称为表实，在表虚表实不同的情况下虽然同是一种感冒的表症，治疗的方法就完全不同。中医在处理症状时就是这样地深入细致，注意极为细小的差别。又如受湿后表现有表症的，如身重疼痛发热就可以用汗法，如果受湿后而表现为腹泻的里症就不能用汗法而需要用温法。病因虽然相同，而症状表现的部位不同，治法也就不同。八纲在临床上的演化是错综复杂的，有表虚里实，上寒下热，表热里寒等等，甚至还有真假之别，如四肢发冷（寒象），口渴口干（热象）。外表的寒的表现是假的，而热的表现是真的，如果按照外表寒的表现而施以热药，就可以使病情加重甚至死亡，如果分辨清楚而施以寒药，也就可以立竿见影。
    西医在不能诊断的疾病面前常常是束手无策的，但在中医方面不论是由细菌、病毒、肿瘤或功能失调等等所引起的病，根据症状通过运用八纲的分析归纳就可以制订治疗方案。症状的出现一定有它的病理、生理的基础，症状可以说明八纲中的属性，可以说明病的部位，病的深浅，病的进退，邪正的盛衰，病人抵抗力的强弱，以及病邪侵犯力的轻重等等。根据这样的方法分析归纳是极为科学的。运用这种归纳方法，同一西医的病名由于症状的不同可能用多种不同的方法进行治疗。如乙型脑炎的治疗，由于症状表现的不同需要多种不同的治疗方法，能够做到仔细的分类，注意到微小的改变而给以正确的治疗，治疗的效果就会十分显著。相反的，不同的西医的病名，由于症状和发生的机转是相同的，治疗的方法也就是相同的。如不同热性病中的发斑症，就可以用同一的原则，在方剂上有些加减来治疗而获得治疗的效果。这与西医用一种药物来治疗某一种细菌或病毒的方向显然不同。根据八纲对症状进行全面分析，然后制订全面的治疗方案，就是辩证施治的治疗方法。这种治疗方法完全不同于头痛医头、脚痛医脚的对症治疗。
    中医的方剂往往比较复杂，而且还随时改变，这也就是根据分析症状和它的变化而随之变更的。症状有主症兼症之分，因此在方剂中不同的药物就负有不同的使命。
    中医在治疗中的突出的指导思想表现在治愈病人而不是治病，不论是从生理还是从病理的角度出发，中医总是把人看成为一个统一的整体，极明确地指出人体的各部都是互相关联和互相影响着的，一个器官的病如果不及时医治就会影响另一器官。如肝有病就会影响脾胃，因此在发现肝病以后就应该保护脾胃，以免脾胃受病。除了重视人的统一整体性，中医也极重视外界环境对人体的影响，在不同的季节有不同的养生方法，不正常的气候会招致疾病，同一种疾病在自然条件不同的地区可能就采用不同的药物或不同的治疗方法。这种高度的科学的思想体系在中医的体系中至少已流传了二千多年。除了整体观念之外，中医治病中更为积极的一面是增进病人的健康。中医治疗一方面着重病因，但是另一方面更重视病人，提高病人的抵抗力或是矫正病理状态使之趋于生理状态，称为“扶正”，克服致病因子称为“驱邪”。中医认为驱邪固然重要，但是扶正更为重要。中医在治疗的目的上不仅要靠药味的力量直接去消灭疾病而铲除病的症状，同时更着重在直接用药的力量来使病人增加抵抗力，恢复自然疗能，协助人体的生理机能，间接驱逐疾病使病症消失。这样的指导思想显然是更为积极的一方面。而西医在这方面的内容显得十分贫乏。
    多少年来西医针对病原的工作做了不少，也获得了很多的成绩。但是单纯地陷在病原的圈子里，也阻碍了医学科学的进一步发展。因此多少年来，投入了大批的人力物力，仍然有很多疾病并没有得到解决，很多的疾病仍然严重地威胁着人民的生命和健康。最近全国医药卫生技术革命展览会和报纸所登载的大量事实，已充分说明很多西医不能治的绝症，中医治好了，西医没有办法的，中医解决了，有些西医能治的，中医可以治疗的更好，这些都给我们指出了新的方向。学习中医以后，不但使我们的思想方法起了改变，同时更进一步体会到中西医合流的必要，从而进一步发扬祖国医学，建立一个新的医学思想体系；对很多目前尚未解决的疾病如肿瘤、高血压、内分泌、功能失调等等，今后不但有着广阔的研究前途，同时将会在不太长的时间内从根本上得到解决。
    党早就提出发扬祖国医学的方针，也早就提出西医学习中医，可是我们由于多年来所受的资产阶级教育，有严重的厚西薄中的思想，不能很好地体会党的方针政策。通过整风运动的教育和这次的学习，更体会到祖国医学有着如此高度的疗效，而多少年来没有能得到进一步的发展；体会到只有党关心人民群众的健康，也只有在共产党的领导下，才有可能把中西医团结起来，使中西医合流，使人民的健康可以得到进一步的保障。要达到中西医合流，创造新的医学体系的任务是艰巨的。如果我们坚决服从党的领导，贯彻党的政策，加以群众的力量，这个艰巨的任务一定能够完成。我们深深体会到只有更好地努力学习，大家鼓足干劲，不用很久，在医学的领域内将会放出光辉灿烂的“卫星”来。
