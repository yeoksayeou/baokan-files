Supporting Key Steel Plants
By Our Commentator

Today, this newspaper published news of many regions across the country vigorously transferring pig iron to support key steel plants in Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places. In the work of supporting key steel plants, many provinces and autonomous regions prioritize sending resources outside the province before inside, preferring to produce less steel themselves in order to provide good iron to key steel plants. This selfless communist spirit is of great significance for the great leap forward in the production of key steel plants and for completing the national plan to double steel production. It should be greatly promoted.

Key steel plants possess modern equipment and relatively high technical levels, which are their advantageous conditions. However, compared with small plants and indigenous furnaces, key steel plants have greater dependency, which is their disadvantageous condition. Small plants and indigenous furnaces are close to the sources of raw materials and fuel, and they can almost "not ask anyone for anything" as long as they do it themselves. Some key steel plants are far from the sources of raw materials and fuel, and the pig iron, coal, and various auxiliary materials they need must be supplied from afar. Some are iron and steel complexes that can produce some pig iron and coke themselves, but others still need to be supplied from elsewhere. This production dependency of key steel plants shows that the leap forward of key steel plants is not just a matter for a few workers in these steel plants, but a task for the whole people. Only if everyone supports key steel plants and helps them solve problems with raw materials, fuel, auxiliary materials, and transportation can the production of key steel plants develop by leaps and bounds.

The production of the eighteen key steel plants across the country has greatly improved in the past two months. During the high-yield week from October 15th to 21st, the average daily output of these key steel plants increased by 27.4% compared with the previous fourteen days. After the high-yield week, the production of many key steel plants continued to leap forward. However, compared with the requirements of the national plan, the production of most key steel plants is still lagging behind and does not meet the requirements of the national plan. Now, these key steel plants are vigorously carrying out mass movements, transforming "foreign expertise" into "mass foreign expertise," striving to better complete and overfulfill the national plan, and have achieved considerable success in this regard. However, as these mass movements in key steel plants develop and steelmaking capacity increases, the supply of pig iron, coal, and auxiliary materials is increasingly exposed as not keeping up. Some key steel plants have even had to reduce production due to the lack of pig iron supply. This situation where the supply of pig iron, coal, and auxiliary materials is not adapted to steelmaking capacity is, on the one hand, a good thing, a necessary phenomenon for key steel plants to break through the old production level and move towards a new production level; on the other hand, it is also an important problem that urgently needs to be solved. If this problem is not solved, it will be difficult for the production of key steel plants to leap forward; even if high-yield "satellites" are launched, it will be difficult to consolidate them. This requires all parts of the country to support key steel plants, providing whatever is needed and vowing to be their strong backing.

The material conditions for supporting key steel plants are generally available. Because since the large-scale development of "small indigenous groups" in various places, a large amount of good iron has been smelted, a large amount of coal has been mined, and a large amount of transportation power has been organized, which is very different from the previous "empty-handed" situation. The problem is whether there is sufficient understanding of the necessity of supporting key steel plants. Some comrades see the great power of "small indigenous groups" on the steel front. A province or a city uses the "small indigenous groups" method to produce several thousand or tens of thousands of tons of steel per day, exceeding the daily output level of the famous Shanghai Iron and Steel Company and even the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. They have a misconception that the production of key steel plants such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Shanghai Iron and Steel Company no longer has a significant impact on the country. They believe that now is the era of widespread flowering, and that focusing on key points and supporting key points is no longer appropriate. This view is obviously wrong. Precisely because now is the era of widespread flowering, and we no longer have eighteen key steel plants, but many steel furnaces like stars, it is even more necessary to pay attention to focusing on key points. Key points are not designated by any individual, but are the objective existence of social life; focusing on key points is not the preference of any individual, but a leadership method that must be mastered in doing any work. We do not belittle "small indigenous groups" in the slightest; on the contrary, we have been and will continue to fight against the idea of ignoring "small indigenous groups." However, we must also see the backbone role of large steel plants such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Shanghai Iron and Steel Company in the national economy. In terms of quantity, these large plants undertake more than 80% of the country's steelmaking tasks, and the quality of production in large plants has a pivotal impact on the completion of the national plan to double steel production. In terms of quality, although the quality of indigenous steel is also very good and can fully meet the needs of local small-scale industries, the production of better quality steel, especially various high-quality steels, to meet the needs of the national basic industries, still depends on large plants with modern smelting equipment. All of this shows that while "small indigenous groups" cannot be ignored, large plants bear the heaviest tasks and are always the focus of the steel front. Focusing only on key steel plants and not developing "small indigenous groups" is walking on one leg; focusing only on "small indigenous groups" and abandoning key steel plants is also walking on one leg.

There are also some comrades who are reluctant to transfer good iron to key steel plants. They feel that it is not easy to smelt a little good iron, so they keep it for themselves and it is convenient to use; if it is transferred to key steel plants, the steel produced will be distributed by the state, which is not worthwhile. We say that cherishing one's own labor results is, of course, human nature; but it is wrong to be unwilling to transfer it to key steel plants or even to "lay an ambush." "If the big river has no water, the small river will dry up." If the production plan of key steel plants is not completed and the plan to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year fails, which will affect the national construction arrangements, which place can be an exception? Only by vigorously supporting key steel plants and ensuring the completion of the production plans of key steel plants can the construction of the entire country be well arranged, and the development of local construction undertakings can be guaranteed. In this sense, transferring good iron to key steel plants is not "sacrificing oneself for others," but "I for everyone, everyone for me."

The era of the Great Leap Forward is an era of great development of the spirit of communist cooperation. Fifty million people smelting steel was originally not for themselves and their close relatives, but for the country, for millions of unfamiliar distant relatives. This matter itself is a manifestation of communist style. In today's high tide of communist style, as long as the necessity of supporting key steel plants is clearly explained to cadres and the masses, prioritizing sending resources outside the province before inside, preferring to produce less steel themselves in order to provide good iron to key steel plants, it will surely win the support of the broad masses. We hope that all parts of the country will vigorously support key steel plants and continuously transport good iron, good coal, and good auxiliary materials to key steel plants!

    支援重点钢厂
    本报评论员
    今天本报发表了全国许多地区大力调运生铁支援
  上海、重庆等地重点钢厂炼钢的消息。许多省和自治区在支援重点钢厂的工作中，先省外，后省内，宁可自己少炼钢，也要把好铁调给重点钢厂。这种舍己为人的共产主义风格，对于重点钢厂的生产大跃进，对于完成全国的钢产加番计划，有着十分重大的意义，应该大大地提倡。
    重点钢厂拥有近代化的设备和比较高的技术水平，这是它的有利条件；但同小厂、土炉比较起来，重点钢厂有更多的依赖性，这又是它的不利条件。小厂、土炉贴近原料、燃料产地，只要自己动手，几乎可以“万事不求人”。重点钢厂中有一部分远离原料、燃料产地，他们所需要的生铁、煤炭和各种辅助原料要由远道供应；有一部分是钢铁联合企业，自己能生产一部分生铁和焦炭，但还有一部分需要外地供应。重点钢厂这种生产上的依赖性，表明重点钢厂的跃进不只是这些钢厂少数职工的事情，而是全民的任务。只有大家都来支援重点钢厂，帮助重点钢厂解决原料、燃料、辅助原料、运输等问题，重点钢厂的生产才能突飞猛进的发展。
    两个月来全国十八个重点钢厂的生产大有好转，在10月15日至21日的高产周内，这些重点钢厂的平均日产量比以前的十四天提高了27.4％。高产周后，许多重点钢厂的生产继续跃进。但是，同国家计划的要求比较起来，多数重点钢厂的生产依然是落后的，达不到国家计划的要求。现在，这些重点钢厂正大搞群众运动，变“大洋专”为“大洋群”，力争更好地完成和超额完成国家计划，并且在这方面取得了相当的成绩。但是，随着这些重点钢厂群众运动的开展，炼钢能力的提高，愈益暴露出生铁、煤炭、辅助原料的供应跟不上去，有些重点钢厂就曾因生铁供应不上而不得不减产。这种生铁、煤炭、辅助原料的供应同炼钢能力不相适应的情况，一方面固然是好事，是重点钢厂突破旧的生产水平、向新的生产水平迈进的必然现象；另一方面也是一个迫切需要解决的重要问题。这个问题不解决，重点钢厂的生产很难跃进；即便放出高产“卫星”，也很难巩固下去。这就需要全国各地都来支援重点钢厂，要啥给啥，誓为后盾。
    支援重点钢厂的物质条件，一般都是具备的。因为各地大搞“小土群”以来，都炼出了大批好铁，采出了大批煤炭，组织了大批运输力量，同以前“手无寸铁”的面貌大不相同了。问题是对于支援重点钢厂的必要性有没有足够的认识。有些同志看到钢铁战线上的“小土群”大显威力，一个省、一个市用“小土群”的办法，日产钢几千吨、几万吨，超过著名的上海钢铁公司，乃至鞍山钢铁公司的日产量水平，就产生一种错觉，似乎鞍钢、上钢等重点钢厂的生产对全国已经没有什么了不起的影响了，认为现在是遍地开花的时代，抓重点、支援重点已经不合时宜了。这种看法显然是错误的。正因为现在是遍地开花的时代，我们拥有的已经不是十八个重点钢厂，而是像繁星一样的许许多多的炼钢炉，就更需要注意抓重点。重点，不是哪一个人封的，而是社会生活的客观存在；抓重点，不是哪一个人的偏爱，而是做任何工作都必须掌握的领导方法。我们丝毫也不看轻“小土群”；相反地，过去一直在、并且今后还要继续同忽视“小土群”的思想作斗争。但是，我们也必须看到，鞍钢、上钢等大型钢厂在国民经济中的骨干作用。从数量上看，这些大厂担负着全国80％以上的炼钢任务，大厂生产情况的好坏，对完成全国钢产加番的计划有举足轻重的影响。从质量上看，土钢的质量虽然也很好，完全能满足地方小型工业的需要，但生产质量更好的钢，特别是各种优质钢，满足国家基本工业的需要，毕竟还要依靠拥有现代化冶炼设备的大厂。凡此种种，足见“小土群”固然不可忽视，但大厂担负的任务最重，总还是钢铁战线的重点所在。只抓重点钢厂，不搞“小土群”，是一条腿走路；只抓“小土群”，丢掉重点钢厂，也是一条腿走路。
    还有些同志舍不得把好铁调给重点钢厂。他们觉得好不容易炼出一点好铁来，自己留着，用起来方便；调给重点钢厂了，炼出钢来由国家分配，划不来。我们说，珍贵自己的劳动成果，固然是人之常情；但不愿意调给重点钢厂，甚至“打埋伏”却是错误的。“大河没水小河干”，重点钢厂的生产计划完不成，今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的计划落了空，影响全国建设的安排，哪个地方能够例外？只有大力支援重点钢厂，保证完成重点钢厂的生产计划，整个国家的建设才好安排，地方建设事业的发展才有保障。从这个意义上说，把好铁调给重点钢厂，“为人”并不“舍己”，而是“我为人人，人人为我”。
    大跃进的时代，是共产主义协作精神发扬光大的时代。五千万人炼钢铁，原来就不是为了自己个人和自己的近亲，而是为了国家，为了千万不相识的远亲。这件事，本身就是共产主义风格的表现。在共产主义风格高涨的今天，只要把支援重点钢厂的必要性向干部和群众讲清楚，先省外，后省内，宁可自己少炼钢，也要把好铁调给重点钢厂，一定能得到广大群众的拥护。我们希望各地都来大力支援重点钢厂，把好铁、好煤、好的辅助原料源源运到重点钢厂去！
