    Mass Movement Creates High Speed
    Anshan Iron and Steel Adds Another "Open Hearth King" to the Battle
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 21st – Another newly built giant open hearth furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel was put into production yesterday, and the first heat of high-quality steel was produced on the same day.
    At 11:55 a.m. on this day, when the order to officially put the new open hearth furnace into production was issued, all the workers in the furnace immediately plunged into battle with excitement. Production conditions showed that each process of the open hearth furnace, such as charging, melting, and refining, was very smooth and was shorter than the original plan. At 11:10 p.m., bursts of red smoke rose above the factory building, and dazzling steel flowed down the steel outlet trough.
    The scale of this open hearth furnace is the same as the large open hearth furnace put into production not long ago. It can produce 1,300 to 1,500 tons of steel per day and is one of the largest open hearth furnaces in the world. It is the fifth large fixed open hearth furnace put into production by Anshan Iron and Steel since June this year.
    These two large open hearth furnaces started construction on June 8 this year. Their construction speed has created a miracle in the construction of giant open hearth furnaces in the world; the installation speed of the newly built open hearth furnace is more than twice as fast as the previous one.
    In the process of building this open hearth furnace, the Party Committee of the construction site adopted the method of launching a large-scale mass movement, directly handing over difficulties such as the large amount of engineering work, the tight schedule, and the shortage of labor to the workers for discussion, and launching a large-scale airing of views, contending, and debating among the employees. In the debate, the employees summed up the experience in the construction of the previous open hearth furnace, criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking that emphasized difficulties and passively waited for conditions, and strengthened their confidence in victory. In the construction process, they boldly broke all the old rules and regulations that hindered the high-speed progress of the project, and made the entire project leap forward. For example, according to convention, mechanical, electrical equipment and pipelines can only be installed after the civil engineering and metal structure projects are completed, but these construction units adopted the method of three-dimensional cross-parallel operations, seizing every opportunity, so that the construction site showed a scene of simultaneous progress in which the factory building was being built above, the heat storage chamber was being built on the ground, the metal components were being installed on the upper part of the open hearth furnace, and bricks were being laid on the lower part.
    Due to the in-depth mobilization of the masses, things that were unimaginable in the past have been achieved. Metal structure workers boldly drove steam cranes onto the platform to install components, and adopted a new overall installation method, completing the installation of the metal components of the open hearth furnace in eleven days. Eighteen scaffolders broke the superstition that large components could not be installed at night, and hoisted the crane beam weighing 186 tons on the night of the 17th, breaking through the last difficult hurdle.
    In the process of construction, the builders and the production, equipment manufacturing, material supply, and transportation departments have all displayed the spirit of communist large-scale cooperation, which is an important factor in the ability of this open hearth furnace to create amazing miracles. The amount of metal structure installation work was large, and the mechanical installation and pipeline engineering team took the initiative to assist them in installing platforms and various pipelines; Dalian, Shenyang, and Fushun also sent more than 100 technicians to support. The construction period of the furnace was tight, but there was a shortage of labor. The captains and engineers of other engineering teams led workers to carry bricks for them; various units of Anshan Iron and Steel also sent tilers to support. In this way, the furnace-building workers completed the bricklaying project of the large open hearth furnace in only four and a half days.

### 群众运动创造高速度  鞍钢又一“平炉王”参战

    群众运动创造高速度
    鞍钢又一“平炉王”参战
    新华社鞍山21日电  鞍钢又有一座新建的巨型平炉在昨天投入生产，当天就炼出了第一炉质量优良的钢水。
    这天上午十一点五十五分，当新平炉正式投入生产的命令下达以后，全炉工人立即兴奋地投入战斗。生产情况表明，这座平炉的装料、熔化、精炼等每个过程都很顺利，而且都比原计划时间缩短了。深夜十一点十分，厂房上空升起一阵阵红色的烟雾，金光耀目的钢水顺着出钢槽滚滚流出。
    这座平炉的规模同不久以前投入生产的大平炉一样，每天能产钢一千三百到一千五百吨，是世界上最大的平炉之一。它是鞍钢从今年6月份以来投入生产的第五座大型固定式平炉。
    这两座大平炉都是在今年6月8日动工兴建的。它们的建设速度都创造了世界巨型平炉建设方面的奇迹；其中新建成的这座平炉的安装速度，比前一座加快了一倍多。
    在建设这座平炉的过程中，工地党委采用大搞群众运动的方法，将工程量大、工期紧迫、劳动力不足等困难，直接交给工人讨论，发动职工群众大鸣大放大辩论。职工们在辩论中总结了前一座平炉施工中的经验，批判了强调困难、消极等待条件的右倾保守思想，坚定了必胜的信心。他们在施工中大胆打破了一切妨碍工程高速度进展的陈规旧律，使整个工程飞跃前进。例如按照常规，要在土建和金属结构工程完毕以后，机械、电气设备和管道才能安装，但是这些施工单位采用立体交叉平行作业的方法，见缝就插，使工地上出现了上面盖厂房地上就砌蓄热室、平炉上部安装金属构件下部就砌砖的齐头并进的施工情景。
    由于深入发动了群众，过去难以想像的事都做到了。金属结构工人大胆地把汽吊开上平台安装构件，并且采用新的整体安装法，十一天就完成了平炉的金属构件的安装。十八个架工破除了大型构件夜间不能安装的迷信，在17日夜间吊装了重达一百八十六吨的吊车梁，突破了最后一道难关。
    在施工过程中，建设者们和生产、设备制造、材料供应以及运输部门之间，都发挥了共产主义大协作的精神，这是这座平炉能够创造惊人奇迹的一个重要因素。金属结构的安装工程量大，机械安装和管道工程队就主动协助他们安装平台和各种管道；大连、沈阳、抚顺也派来一百多技术工人支援。筑炉的工期紧迫，但是缺少劳动力，其他工程队的队长、工程师，就带着工人为他们背砖；鞍钢各单位也抽出瓦工来支援。这样就使筑炉工人仅用四天半时间便完成了大平炉的砌砖工程。
