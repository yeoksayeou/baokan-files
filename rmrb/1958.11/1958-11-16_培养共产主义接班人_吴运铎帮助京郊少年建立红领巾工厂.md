    Cultivating Communist Successors
    Wu Yunduo Helps Establish Red Scarf Factory for Youths in Beijing Suburbs
    (Our dispatch) The Beijing Haidian District Red Scarf Factory, established with the help, guidance, and care of Comrade Wu Yunduo, officially opened this afternoon.
    This Red Scarf Factory was established with the royalties from Comrade Wu Yunduo's book "Dedicate Everything to the Party." In addition to using the royalties to purchase many machines and tools for the factory, Comrade Wu Yunduo, forgetting his fatigue and enduring physical pain, personally made tools for the Red Scarf Factory with his disabled hand. Young Pioneers collected scrap iron and bricks everywhere to donate to the factory for its establishment. The factory now has six workshops, including machining, fitting, electrical work, carpentry, forging, and steelmaking. More than 300 outstanding Young Pioneers have become the factory's young workers. The factory is managed by a management committee composed of Young Pioneers, with 15-year-old Young Pioneer Wang Guirong serving as the director.
    The opening ceremony began amidst the rumble of drums and enthusiastic applause. After factory director Wang Guirong delivered the opening speech, Comrade Wu Yunduo spoke, urging all the Young Pioneers in the factory to manufacture small machine tools and various tools used by the factory themselves, gradually expanding the factory, helping farmers improve farm tools, and helping Young Pioneers in other places establish more Red Scarf Factories.
    Ye Guangyao, director of the Red Scarf Factory's electrical workshop and a Young Pioneer, read the oath of the young workers at the meeting. The oath stated: "We guarantee to study and work hard, take Uncle Wu Yunduo as an example, and strive to train ourselves into workers who can dedicate everything to the Party."
    After the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the opening of the Red Scarf Factory, Comrade Wu Yunduo, accompanied by factory director Wang Guirong and others, visited the various workshops. In the machining workshop, Comrade Wu Yunduo also used one hand to demonstrate lathe operation and provide guidance to the Young Pioneers.

    培养共产主义接班人
    吴运铎帮助京郊少年建立红领巾工厂
    本报讯　在吴运铎同志帮助、指导和关怀下，建立起来的北京市海淀区红领巾工厂，今天下午正式开幕了。
    这座红领巾工厂是吴运铎同志用“把一切献给党”一书的稿费帮助建立起来的。吴运铎同志除用稿费为这个工厂购置了许多机器和工具外，他还忘记了劳累，忍受了身体的疼痛，用残废的手亲自为红领巾工厂制作工具，少先队员为建立自己的工厂纷纷到处拾废铁、废砖捐献给工厂。这个工厂现在设有机工、钳工、电工、木工、锻工和炼钢等六个车间，三百多个优秀少先队员成了工厂的小工人，工厂由少先队员组成了管理委员会自己管理，十五岁的少先队员王桂荣担任了厂长。
    在轰隆隆的鼓声和热情的掌声中开幕典礼开始，厂长王桂荣致开幕词后，吴运铎同志讲话，他要求全厂的少先队员自己动手制造小型机床，和工厂使用的各项工具，把工厂逐渐扩大，并要帮助农民改良农具，帮助其他地方少先队员建立更多的红领巾工厂。
    红领巾工厂电工车间主任、少先队员叶光耀在会上宣读了小工人的誓言，誓言里写道：“我们保证努力学习和劳动，以吴运铎叔叔为榜样，努力把自己锻炼成为能把一切献给党的工人”。
    红领巾工厂开幕剪彩后，吴运铎同志在厂长王桂荣等人的陪同下参观了各个车间。吴运铎同志在机工车间还用一只手为少先队员们作了车床操作示范指导。
