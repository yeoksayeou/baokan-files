Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 11th: The Soviet Union and Poland statement, signed by Khrushchev and Gomulka in Moscow on November 10th, was published here.

The statement said: "During the talks between the Polish and Soviet delegations in Moscow, both sides confirmed that their views on all the issues discussed were in complete agreement."

The statement noted with satisfaction that the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Poland has been strengthened. In order to expand Soviet-Polish economic cooperation, the Soviet government has agreed to provide Poland with technical assistance to help develop certain important sectors of the Polish national economy, in particular the exploration and exploitation of new oil and natural gas mines, the construction of oil processing plants, the expansion of the Lenin Metallurgical Combine, and the expansion of the copper smelting industry.

The statement said: "An uncompromising struggle against revisionism is a necessary condition for achieving success in socialist construction. Revisionism is the main danger at this stage because it attempts to undermine the fundamental principles of the Marxist-Leninist ideological system and weaken the unity of the socialist family and the international workers' movement."

The statement said: The cause of socialism requires further creative development of the theory of Marxism-Leninism, adherence to the universal laws of socialist construction, and the bold implementation of these universal laws through methods suited to the conditions of each country. It also requires a struggle against manifestations of dogmatism.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet Union and Poland are disturbed by the situation created in the Taiwan Strait region due to the US aggression against the People's Republic of China. The United States continues to carry out armed interference in China's internal affairs in the Taiwan Strait region and attempts to turn China's internal problems into international conflicts.

The statement said: "The Soviet and Polish delegations fully support the just sovereignty of the great Chinese people to liberate and unify all their territory, including Taiwan and the coastal islands. They fully agree with the position of the Government of the People's Republic of China demanding the withdrawal of US troops from the Taiwan area."

The statement emphasized the danger of the policy pursued by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its controlling US leadership group, which is to turn Western Europe into an atomic arsenal. The main pillar of this policy in Europe is the position taken by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Both sides support the proposal of the German Democratic Republic to begin preparations for the conclusion of a German peace treaty. The statement pointed out that this would greatly alleviate the tense situation in Europe.

The two delegations expressed their belief that the proposal of the Polish People's Republic to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe could successfully promote the elimination of the threat of atomic war and strengthen the security of this conflict-prone region in Europe.

The statement said: The delegation of the Polish People's Republic firmly supports the Soviet proposal to convene a summit meeting to discuss and resolve the most urgent disarmament issues and measures related to strengthening European and world security. However, due to the delay and evasion of negotiations by some, primarily the US leadership group, the two delegations believe it is necessary to strengthen the defensive Warsaw Pact, which defends the common security of all countries in the socialist camp.

The Polish delegation agreed that the most urgent task at present should be for the major powers to reach an agreement on the immediate, universal and permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests.

Both sides fully agree with the aspirations of the people of all countries to break free from the shackles of imperialism and colonialism, and warmly support the struggle of the Arab people against imperialist attempts to maintain and restore their rule in these countries through new colonialist means.

The statement pointed out the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Polish United Workers' Party exchanged information on the activities of the two parties, discussed the relationship between the two parties and pressing issues in the international workers' movement, and discussed concrete measures to further exchange the experience of the Party's work and expand contact between the two parties. The statement noted with satisfaction that cooperation between the two parties has become closer.

The statement announced that the delegation of the Polish People's Republic invited the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, and other Soviet party and state leaders to visit Poland. This invitation has been gratefully accepted.

    苏联和波兰发表声明
    建设社会主义必须同修正主义斗争
    苏联决定以技术援助波兰发展经济
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：这里发表了由赫鲁晓夫和哥穆尔卡11月10日在莫斯科签字的苏联和波兰声明。
    声明说：“在波兰和苏联两国代表团在莫斯科会谈期间，双方确认对所讨论的各项问题的看法是完全一致的。”
    声明中满意地指出，苏波两国人民的友谊有了加强。苏联政府为了扩大苏波两国经济合作，已经同意给波兰以技术援助，帮助发展波兰国民经济的某些重要部门，特别是勘探和开采新的石油矿和天然瓦斯矿，建设石油加工工厂，扩大列宁冶金联合工厂，以及扩大炼铜工业等。
    声明说：“同修正主义作不妥协的斗争是社会主义建设获得成就的必需条件，修正主义是现阶段的主要危险，因为它企图破坏马克思列宁主义思想体系的基本原则，并削弱社会主义国家大家庭和国际工人运动的团结。”
    声明说：社会主义的事业要求进一步创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的学说，遵守社会主义建设的普遍规律，并且通过适合于每个国家条件的方法来大胆地实现这些普遍规律，还要求同教条主义的表现作斗争。
    声明指出，苏联和波兰不安地注意着由于美国侵略中华人民共和国而在台湾海峡地区造成的局势，美国还继续在台湾海峡地区对中国的内政进行武装干涉并且企图把中国的内部问题变成国际冲突。
    声明说：“苏联和波兰代表团完全支持伟大的中国人民对解放和统一包括台湾和沿海岛屿在内的全部国土的正当主权。它们完全赞同中华人民共和国政府要求美国军队撤出台湾地区的立场。”
    声明中着重指出北大西洋公约及其控制者美国的领导集团所奉行的、把西欧变成为原子武器库的政策的危险性。这个政策在欧洲的主要支柱是德意志联邦共和国政府所采取的立场。
    双方支持德意志民主共和国提出的关于开始准备缔结对德和约的建议，声明指出，这样就能够在很大的程度上缓和欧洲的紧张局势。
    两国代表团表示相信，波兰人民共和国关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议能够成功地促进消除原子战争威胁和加强欧洲这个孕育着冲突的地区的安全。
    声明说：波兰人民共和国代表团坚决支持苏联关于召开最高级会议来讨论和解决最迫切的裁军问题以及同加强欧洲和世界安全有关措施的建议。但是，由于有人，首先是美国领导集团拖延和回避谈判，两国代表团认为必须加强防御性的华沙条约，这个条约捍卫着社会主义阵营所有国家的共同安全。
    波兰代表团同意，目前最迫切的任务应当是，大国之间就立即、普遍、永远地停止核武器试验的问题达成协议。
    双方完全赞同为摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义的桎梏而斗争的各国人民的愿望，热情支持阿拉伯国家人民反对帝国主义企图用新的殖民主义手段在这些国家中维持和恢复统治的斗争。
    声明指出，苏联共产党和波兰统一工人党的领导人交换了有关两党工作的情况，讨论了两党之间的关系问题以及国际工人运动中的迫切问题，讨论了进一步交流党的工作经验以及扩大两党之间的接触的具体措施。声明满意地确认，两党之间的合作更加紧密了。
    声明宣布，波兰人民共和国代表团邀请苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫等苏联党和国家的其他领导人访问波兰。这个邀请已被满意地接受。
