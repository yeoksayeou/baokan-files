Xinhua News Agency, 5th: China's great leap forward in industrial production has received generous and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union in terms of equipment supply.

    To support China's steel-led industrial Great Leap Forward, by the end of October this year, the Soviet Union had supplied complete sets of equipment for more than 20 modern large-scale smelting, machinery, power generation, and coal enterprises. By the end of this year, more than 30 key enterprises across the country will be fully put into production with the strong support of the Soviet Union.

    This year, the Soviet Union's supply of various non-complete sets of machinery and transportation equipment to China has also increased significantly compared to last year. For example, the number of various machine tools will increase by more than three times compared to last year, power generation equipment by six times, construction machinery by more than two times, and more than 10,000 trucks, which is dozens of times more than last year. From January to September, most of these equipments were delivered to China on schedule, ensuring the needs of production and construction in various industrial sectors in a timely manner. For example, modern large-scale enterprises such as the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant and the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant were quickly installed and put into production after the Soviet equipment arrived.

    Due to the rapid development of China's industrial construction, many projects are required to be completed and put into production ahead of schedule. The Soviet people have carried forward a high degree of internationalist spirit, actively rushing to manufacture equipment to ensure the early supply of equipment required by these enterprises. For example, the main equipment of the No. 1 blast furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company was all supplied by the Soviet Union in complete sets. It was originally scheduled to be completed in July 1959. Later, WISCO decided to produce iron on October 1 this year. The Soviet government attached great importance to and supported this, requesting relevant economic zones and factories and mines involved in manufacturing equipment for WISCO's No. 1 blast furnace to provide strong support and prioritize the manufacturing tasks of the No. 1 blast furnace, and arrange for manufacturing as soon as possible. As a result, many important equipment were manufactured and shipped to China ahead of schedule in July and August. With the multi-faceted assistance of the Soviet Union, WISCO's No. 1 blast furnace produced iron on September 13, eighteen days ahead of the Leap Forward plan. In order to promote the priority development of electric power and solve the difficulty of insufficient power supply in some industrial bases, the Soviet Union supplied complete sets of equipment for many power stations in China a quarter to half a year in advance, so that the 250,000-kilowatt power generation capacity originally planned to be put into production in 1959 was generated this year ahead of schedule. In addition, the Soviet Union also delivered more than 200 machine tools, more than 180 diesel engines, and some forging and pressing equipment and lifting equipment to China ahead of schedule, and also supplied more than 89,000 tons of steel, which was originally scheduled for delivery in 1959, in advance this year, effectively supporting the Great Leap Forward in various industrial sectors.

    With the rapid development of China's industrial production, some of the originally ordered equipment is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of production and construction. Therefore, since the second half of the year, China has successively increased its orders for some equipment from the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has tried its best to provide assistance for these orders. For example, in order to assist China in solving the current tense transportation situation, in addition to the more than 9,300 various vehicles and locomotives that the Soviet Union has already delivered to China in accordance with the original agreement, it has recently decided to increase the supply of 8,000 heavy-duty trucks, 2,000 trailers, and more than 500,000 tons of oil, and will also supply a batch of locomotives and rails, which will play a great role in solving the current urgent shortage of transportation vehicles in China. According to China's policy of simultaneously developing large, medium and small enterprises, the Soviet Union has also transferred its existing 37,000-kilowatt small-capacity hydro and thermal power equipment in complete sets to China, and they will be shipped one after another within this year. These small power equipment will be installed in rural areas or temporary construction sites, and will emit light together with the "night pearls" in China's rural areas.

### 苏联送来好设备　支援我国大跃进

    苏联送来好设备　支援我国大跃进
    新华社5日讯　我国工业生产大跃进，得到了苏联在设备供应方面优厚无私的援助。
    为支援我国以钢为纲的工业大跃进，到今年10月底止，苏联今年已经供应我国二十多个现代化大型冶炼、机械、发电、煤炭等企业的成套设备；到今年年底，全国就将有三十多个重点企业在苏联的大力支援下全部投入生产。
    今年苏联供应我国的各种非成套的机械设备和交通运输工具也比去年有很大的增长，如各种机床将比去年增加三倍多，发电设备增加六倍，土建机械增加二倍多，载重汽车一万多辆，比去年增加几十倍。从1月至9月份，这些设备中的大部分已如期运交我国，及时保证了各工业部门生产和建设的需要，如武汉重型机床厂、洛阳矿山机器厂等现代化大型企业，在苏联设备运到后，很快就安装完毕投入了生产。
    由于我国工业建设的飞跃发展，不少工程都要求提前建成投入生产，苏联人民发扬高度国际主义精神，积极赶制设备，保证了这些企业所需设备的提前供应。例如武汉钢铁公司一号高炉的主要设备都是苏联成套供应的，原定在1959年7月竣工，后来武钢决定提前到今年10月1日出铁，苏联政府对此十分重视与支持，要求为武钢一号高炉制造设备的有关经济区、有关厂矿大力支援，把一号高炉的设备制造任务放在首要地位，尽先安排制造，结果在7、8月份就把许多重要设备提前制成运送到我国。在苏联多方面的援助下，武钢一号高炉比跃进计划又提前了十八天，在9月13日就出铁了。为了促进电力先行，解决部分工业基地电力供应不足的困难，苏联又提前一个季度到半年供应了我国许多电站的成套设备，使原计划要到1959年才能投入生产的二十五万瓩发电能力，提前在今年发电。此外苏联还提前交给我国二百多台机床、一百八十多台柴油机和一部分锻压设备和起重设备，并把原定在1959年交货的八万九千多吨钢材，也提前在今年供应，有力地支援了各工业部门的大跃进。
    随着我国工业生产的飞速发展，原订的一些设备还不足以满足生产和建设上的需要，因此下半年以来我国又陆续向苏联增订了一部分设备，对于这些订货，苏联方面都尽力给予援助。例如为了协助我国解决目前交通运输的紧张状况，苏联除按照原协定已经运交我国九千三百多辆各种汽车、机车外，最近又决定再增加供应载重卡车八千辆、拖车二千辆、石油五十多万吨，并且还要供应一批机车和钢轨，这对于解决我国当前最紧迫的交通工具不足的困难，将发挥很大的作用。根据我国大中小企业同时并举的方针，苏联还把他们现存的三万七千多瓩小容量的水力和火力发电设备成套地拨让给我国，并且年内就可陆续运到，这些小型发电设备将在农村或临时工地上安装，和我国农村的“夜明珠”一道发射光芒。
