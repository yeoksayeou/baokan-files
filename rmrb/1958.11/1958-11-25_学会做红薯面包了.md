    Learned How to Make Sweet Potato Bread
    The People's Daily published on November 6th, on page 3, the news that more than twenty counties in Henan Province had achieved sweet potato bread production, with very specific instructions on how to make it. The railway district cafeteria in our city started trial production based on this news, mixing 80% sweet potato puree with 20% corn flour. Initially, there were cracks due to the coarse corn flour. Later, the problem of cracks was solved by using sweet potatoes mixed with fine corn flour for trial production.
    Everyone praised the sweet potato bread for being not only delicious but also cheap, costing less than a dime per pound, even cheaper than corn buns. The city also held an on-site meeting on the 18th, preparing to promote it throughout the city.

    学会做红薯面包了
    人民日报11月6日第三版发表的河南省二十多个县实现红薯面包化的消息，对制作方法介绍得很具体。我市铁路地区食堂，根据这条消息开始试制，把80％的白薯泥掺上20％的玉米面，最初因玉米面粗糙，有裂纹，后来又用白薯掺细玉米面试制，解决了裂纹问题。
    白薯面包人人夸好，不仅好吃，而且价廉，一斤还用不了一角钱，比玉米窝头还便宜。18日市里还召开了现场会议，准备在全市推广。
