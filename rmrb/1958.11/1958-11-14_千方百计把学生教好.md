    Do Everything Possible to Teach Students Well
    Xue Ya

    A new era produces new schools, and new schools need new teachers.

    The teachers of the Shanghai State Cotton Mill No. 17 Red and Expert University have devised methods to quickly teach students to write articles and poems in order to popularize education as quickly as possible. They have come up with ways to use physical objects to explain various production theories, and they go deep among the students to solve learning difficulties. Even to ensure that workers can attend classes on time, they buy breakfast for the workers. This kind of thinking, of doing everything possible to teach students well, is a concrete manifestation of a noble communist style and is a product of our great era.

    In the past, some teachers in this factory had another "truth": teachers were only responsible for teaching, and they didn't care whether students understood or not; they taught students who came, and didn't teach those who didn't; teachers were teachers and students were students during class, and after class everyone went their separate ways. Teachers drew a line between themselves and the factory, society, and workers. Anyone who provided a little extra service for students was considered to have lost their status as a teacher! But when these teachers, under the leadership of the Party, stepped out of their small personal circles and participated in the broad mass struggle, disregarding personal gains and losses, they did whatever was beneficial to production; they did whatever best improved the level of the masses. These teachers are no longer isolated teachers detached from the masses, but teachers who are integrated with society, production, and students. These are new teachers. They are a cell of the entire great collective. As the entire society moves forward, they also move forward. They are armed with collectivism and communist ideology. They repel individualism and bourgeois ideology from wherever they attack. Some teachers at the State Cotton Mill No. 17, in order to seize every minute and second for learning and to prevent students from attending class hungry, opened a small shop. The teachers bought the workers' breakfast in advance, so that the workers could eat their fill and attend class immediately after work. Some people with tinted glasses disapproved, saying, how can teachers become merchants? This lowers the status of teachers! Some teachers answered well: "To build communism, workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers are not divided, so why can't we be merchants?!" Such ambition and such style are the true colors of a new type of teacher. Lenin, in his speech at the All-Russian Congress of Internationalist Teachers, said: "Teachers cannot confine themselves within the narrow circle of teaching activities. Teachers should become one with all the fighting working masses. The task of the new pedagogy is to link the activities of teachers with the task of organizing a socialist society."

    The dividing line between new and old teachers lies here: teaching for individualism or teaching for communism. Teachers, especially some older teachers, should immediately put down their airs, throw themselves into the fiery struggle, and become advanced educators.

    千方百计把学生教好
    薛雅
    新的时代产生新的学校，新的学校需要新的教师。
    上海国棉十七厂红专大学的教师，为了尽快地普及教育，想出快速教学生写文章、作诗歌的办法；想出用实物来说明各种生产中的理论的办法；深入学员解决学习中的困难，甚至为了使工人能按时上课，还代工人买早点。这种千方百计为了把学生教好的思想是高尚的共产主义风格的具体表现，这是我们伟大时代的产物。
    在这个厂过去有些教师他们有另外一个“真理”，教师只管教，至于学生听得懂听不懂，教师不管；学生来就教，不来就不教；上课时是教师、学生，下了课各奔东西。教师把自己同工厂、社会和工人之间划了一道鸿沟，谁要为学生多服了点务，那就有失教师的身份了！但是当这些教师在党的领导下，跳出了个人的小圈子，参加到广大的群众斗争中去，不计个人得失，他们看到什么对生产有利就做什么；怎样做最能提高群众的水平，他们就怎样做。这些教师不再是脱离群众的孤立的教师，而是同社会、生产、学生结合在一起的教师。这些新的教师。他们是整个大集体的一个细胞，整个社会在前进，他们也在前进。他们被集体主义和共产主义思想武装起来了。个人主义和资产阶级思想从哪里进攻，就把它们从哪里打退。国棉十七厂有的教师为了争取一分一秒时间学习，又怕学生饿着肚子上课，就开了一个小卖部，教师提前把工人的早点买来，工人一下班就可以吃得饱饱地上课。有些戴着有色眼镜的人不以为然，说教师怎能当商人，这是降低了教师的身份！有的教师回答得好：“建设共产主义，工农商学兵不分，为什么我们不能当商人？！”这样的志气、这样的风格，才是新型教师的本色。列宁在全俄国际主义教师代表大会上演说曾说到：“教师不能把自己放在狭隘的教学活动的圈子里。教师应该和一切战斗着的劳动群众打成一片。新教育学的任务是要把教师的活动同组织社会主义社会的任务联系起来。”
    新教师和旧教师的分水岭就在这里，是为个人主义而教书，还是为共产主义而教书。教师们，特别是一些老教师，应当立刻放下架子，投身到火热的斗争中去，成为一个先进的教育工作者。
