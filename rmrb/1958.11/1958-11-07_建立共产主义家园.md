Building a Communist Homeland
To all members of the "Rising Sun" Collective Farm in Irbit, Sverdlovsk Oblast:

    As we celebrate the forty-first anniversary of the October Revolution, we wholeheartedly wish you a happy holiday, a bountiful harvest, and a life that grows happier year by year! Inspired by your example, we have established a beautiful and happy big family – the People's Commune. In this commune, meals are free, and public canteens and nurseries have been universally established, liberating all women from household chores. Everyone is joyfully laboring in large-scale production brigades with the spirit of combat. Our autumn harvest is basically complete, and we are currently preparing to harvest autumn vegetables and build sun-facing beds and greenhouses to ensure a large supply of fresh vegetables to the residents of Beijing during the winter. Our small indigenous blast furnaces are also blooming everywhere, with a maximum daily output of four tons of steel.

    We are excited to learn that the Soviet people are also redoubling their efforts, with many agricultural products already surpassing the United States. Let us join hands and move forward, launching more and bigger satellites in agricultural production, leaving the imperialist countries far behind!
            The Entire Membership of the Si Ji Qing People's Commune in Beijing

    建立共产主义家园斯维德诺夫州伊尔彼特奇朝霞集体农庄全体庄员：
    当十月革命四十一周年纪念日来到的时候，我们衷心祝贺你们节日愉快，祝贺你们农业丰收，祝贺你们一年比一年更幸福！以你们为榜样，我们已经成立了幸福美满的大家园——人民公社。在这个公社里，吃饭不要钱，普遍地设立了公共食堂和托儿所，妇女全部由家务劳动中解放了出来。大家都在生产大兵团里以作战的精神愉快地劳动着。我们的秋收已基本完成，最近正准备收秋菜和打阳畦盖温室，保证在冬季里大量供应新鲜蔬菜给北京的居民。我们社里的小土炉也遍地开了花，有一天最多炼了四吨钢。
    我们兴奋地知道苏联人民也正在加倍努力工作，有许多农产品已经超过了美国。让我们共同携手前进，在农业生产中放出更多、更大的卫星，把帝国主义国家远远地抛在我们的后面吧！
            北京市四季青人民公社全体社员
