    What an Elevator Operator Sees
    By Wang Changgui, Elevator Operator, Beijing Friendship Hotel
    I am an elevator operator, and I receive Soviet experts and international friends every day. The noble qualities shown by the Soviet comrades in all aspects have left a deep impression on us.

    One cold winter night last year, I was on duty in the elevator, waiting for a Soviet expert who was working outside and hadn't returned yet. "Comrade, why aren't you off work yet..." It turned out to be a Soviet science expert who was still working late into the night. He was about to go downstairs for a walk in the courtyard, but after speaking to me, he didn't go downstairs and returned to his room. After a while, this old expert brought me a lot of fruit and high-quality candies that others had given him, and said with concern, "It's late, you need to rest, you can let them (referring to the experts working outside) walk upstairs..."

    Also staying here was the wife of an expert, a doctor with two children in school. She taught her children not to take the elevator when going up and down the stairs, to save electricity and prolong the life of the elevator. She always cleaned the room and poured water herself. At night, she would often gently turn off unnecessary lights in the building, and when she saw us moving things, she would enthusiastically come to help. Once this spring, I caught a cold, and when she saw that I was uncomfortable, she said, "Comrade Wang, big wind... sick, right?". Although her Chinese was not fluent, I understood her meaning completely. Soon, this kind mother asked a nurse to bring me some medicine and told me, "The doctor also wants you to drink more plain water and keep warm." She and her family returned to their country not long ago. On the morning of the day we parted, I also came to see her, shook her hand, and hugged her. I clearly remember that I was so excited that I shed tears at that time.

    一个电梯司机看到的
    北京友谊宾馆电梯司机  王长贵
    我是一个电梯司机，每天接待苏联专家和国际友人，苏联同志在各方面表现的高贵品质，给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    在去年寒冬的一个深夜里，为了等候在外工作还没回来的苏联专家，我一直在电梯上值班。“同志，您为什么还不下班休息……。”原来这是一位工作到深夜还没休息的苏联科学专家，现在他要下楼到大院子里散散步去，可是他跟我说完了话，并没有下楼，返回房间去了。不一会，这位老专家抱来很多水果和别人送他的高级糖果给我吃，还关切的说“天不早了，你需要休息，可以让他们（指在外工作的专家）走上楼去……。”
    在我们这里住的还有一位专家的爱人，她是位医生，有两个孩子在上学，她教导孩子们上下楼不要坐电梯，以节省电和延长电梯的寿命。她向来是自己来打扫房间和倒水的，夜晚，她常常把大楼里不必要的电灯轻轻地关上，见到我们搬东西时就热情的跑来协助。今年春天有一次我感冒了，她看到我有些不舒服就说：“王同志，大风……病啦，对？”。虽然，她中文说的并不通顺，意思我却全明白，不一会，这位慈祥的母亲让一位护士给我拿来了药片，告诉我：“医生还要你多喝些白水，要保体温”。她和全家在不久前，已经回国了，临分手的那天早晨，我也来看她，跟她握手、拥抱，我清楚的记得，我当时激动得流下了热泪。
