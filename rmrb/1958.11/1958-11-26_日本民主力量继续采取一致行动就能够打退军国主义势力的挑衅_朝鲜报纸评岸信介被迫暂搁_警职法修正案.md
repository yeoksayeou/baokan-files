Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 25th: The "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today stating that the Kishi Nobusuke clique in Japan had to temporarily shelve its fascist bill to amend the "Police Duties Execution Law" under the opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people, which is a victory for the Japanese democratic forces. However, the commentary pointed out that although the Kishi Nobusuke government has suffered a major blow, it will not abandon its militaristic and fascist policies.

The commentary emphasized: "As long as the Japanese working class and all democratic forces take concerted action as they did in the struggle against Kishi Nobusuke's amendment of the "Police Duties Execution Law", they will be able to repel all kinds of provocative actions by the remnants of militarism headed by Kishi Nobusuke. The editorial said that peace-loving and democratic people all over the world actively support and sympathize with the struggle of the Japanese people.
