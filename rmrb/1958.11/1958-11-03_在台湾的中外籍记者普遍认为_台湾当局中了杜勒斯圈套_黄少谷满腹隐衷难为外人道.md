Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 1st: Hong Kong's Kuomintang newspaper "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" published a dispatch yesterday from its reporter stationed in Taiwan, saying that among news colleagues interviewing about the Chiang-Dulles talks in Taipei, regardless of Chinese or foreign nationality, "everyone's first reaction to the joint communique was that China (referring to the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group) fell into Dulles' trap and openly announced the abandonment of the use of force."

The dispatch said that when Huang Shao-gu, the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Minister of Foreign Affairs," sent Dulles off on the plane, he was forced by Chinese journalists to hold a press conference to explain the "background" of the talks. After listening to the Chinese journalists complain that they could not get news from the Taiwan authorities and had to watch foreign journalists publish a large amount of news, Huang Shao-gu said with an extremely tired face, "You don't know how many difficulties I have encountered. You will understand when you read diplomatic history in the future."

The dispatch continued, "The reporters told Huang Shao-gu that Dulles said a sentence before boarding the plane: 'I feel very, very satisfied.' Everyone asked Mr. Huang if he was also satisfied? Mr. Huang smiled bitterly and said: 'At this time and place, it can be considered satisfactory.'" The dispatch vaguely revealed the indignant mood caused by the Chiang-Dulles joint communique in Taiwan, and then said that Taiwan's Chinese newspapers, "even purely private ones, could not freely and thoroughly criticize the joint communique objectively and profoundly."

    在台湾的中外籍记者普遍认为
    台湾当局中了杜勒斯圈套
    黄少谷满腹隐衷难为外人道
    新华社香港1日电　香港国民党报纸“工商日报”昨天登载了该报驻台湾记者的一篇通讯说，在台北采访蒋杜会谈消息的新闻同业之间，不分中国籍与外国籍，“大家对会谈公报的第一个反应便认为中国（指台湾蒋介石集团）中了杜勒斯的圈套，明白宣布放弃使用武力。”
    这篇通讯说，当蒋介石集团的“外交部长”黄少谷在把杜勒斯送上飞机以后，他被中国籍记者们硬逼着举行了一次交代会谈“背景”的记者会。在听完了中国记者们诉苦说从台湾当局方面采访不到消息，坐视外国记者发表大批消息以后，黄少谷那极度疲倦的脸上毫无表情地说，“你们不知道我遭遇到了多少困难，将来你们读外交史时就可以明白了。”
    通讯继续说，“记者们告诉黄少谷说，杜勒斯在登飞机前说了一句话：‘我感到非常非常的满意。’大家问黄氏是否也满意？黄氏苦笑了一下说：‘在此时此地，也可以算满意了。’”通讯隐约地透露了蒋杜会谈公报在台湾引起的愤懑情绪后说，台湾的中文报纸“即使是纯民营的，也未能畅所欲言地对联合公报加以客观而深刻的批判”。
