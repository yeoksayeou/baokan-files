Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch: The Nanjing Telecommunications Instrument Factory and Nanjing No. 33 Middle School have merged, with workers and students going to workshops for production and classrooms for lessons on schedule.

After the factory and school merged, the school's teaching was further integrated with practice. Teachers are homeroom teachers in the classroom and deputy workshop directors in the workshop, teaching both students and workers. The school's literature, physics, chemistry, geometry, mathematics and other courses have been thoroughly reformed in combination with actual production. For example, in geometry, teachers combine several basic shapes with the shape of a radio wooden case for explanation. The principles and molecular formulas of physics and chemistry are explained in combination with the structural shape of the factory and school's own steel furnace and the chemical action of steelmaking and ironmaking. They explain in the morning and practice in the afternoon. Students reflect that things they didn't understand after being told ten times in the past, they now understand after only one time. The school has added a radio technology course, taught by a veteran factory worker and four students who have mastered the operation techniques. They have formed a research group and implement the principle of "the capable are teachers." In terms of course proportion, the class hours of politics, Chinese, and mathematics have been increased, while the class hours of history, geography, music, art, and physiology and hygiene have been reduced. The missing courses are supplemented by extracurricular lectures, clubs, Red Cross and other activities. When students go to the workshop, they feel that they are directly engaged in production, and they are even more enthusiastic. They have basically mastered the technology that used to take half a year to learn in a week.

The merger of the factory and school has also greatly boosted the workers' enthusiasm. The Telecommunications Instrument Factory was merged from several production cooperatives a few months ago. Without mechanical equipment, it can only process and assemble, but cannot manufacture. Workers often feel that without culture, their practical experience cannot be systematically summarized and improved. The factory is small and weak, and they do not have the courage to carry out technical revolution. After the merger of the factory and school, the workers sitting in the classroom for classes became bolder. They also expressed that they would use the courage and method of ants gnawing bones to manufacture equipment and produce themselves. The first batch of two machine tools will be completed within a week. They are determined to strive to become a large factory and school with an annual output of 150,000 to 200,000 radios next year. When the factory and school merged and took the first cultural lesson, the sixty-one-year-old worker Liu Guanjun sat in the first row and listened quietly. After listening to the lesson, the old workers Zheng Guojian and Liu Ruzhen were so happy that they couldn't sleep all night. The workers are confident that they will become production experts and outstanding students, achieve both literary and military skills, and be both red and expert. At present, the school has set up two classes, junior high school first grade and high school first grade. Next year, university classes will be added.

After the factory and school merged, teaching and production were unified. The original factory workers are now on a two-shift system, with each shift spending eight hours on production and learning in a ratio of eight to four, that is, eight hours of production, three and a half hours of learning, and half an hour of reading newspapers. After the new workers and students become proficient in operation, the workers' learning time will be gradually increased. The students in this school are all junior high school students. The twelve classes in the second and third grades learn and produce in a ratio of four to four (no night shift). Each day, six classes take turns learning and producing in the morning and afternoon. The four classes in the first grade, because the students are younger, are responsible for production labor such as small factories, small farms, breeding, greening, and waste recycling for three afternoons a week. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of different types of work, the classes of the same grade in the whole school have been reorganized according to age, which is convenient for a class to act collectively. The students' labor remuneration is temporarily used for collective welfare and subsidies for outstanding students in difficulty, and will gradually transition to reducing or exempting tuition and meal expenses next year.

At first, a few teachers opposed the implementation of part-work and part-study in junior high schools and the integration of factories and schools. They said that the merger of factories and schools would make the school a mess and affect future development. Some people also doubted that after the merger of factories and schools, the students' classroom learning time would be reduced, which would reduce the quality of teaching and fail to meet the requirements at graduation. In response to these problems, the school's Party branch led a large-scale debate, held parent symposiums, and tested students in several basic courses such as physics, Chinese, and geometry. Facts have proved that because students have connected with production practice and broadened their thinking, their answers to many questions have exceeded what the teachers taught. Jiang Rulin's parents saw that their fourteen-year-old child was good at both studying and production, and happily said that the future of such students after graduation will be broad, and they can go to high school, work as workers, or enter secondary technical schools.

The merger of factories and schools has made workers and students truly blend together and be harmonious and seamless. In the past, when students worked part-time in factories, factories often found it difficult to take into account the students' age, physique, skills, and experience due to production needs, so it often happened that the finished products produced by students with difficulty were unqualified, and both parties were dissatisfied. Ding Guanshan, a veteran worker in the metalworking workshop of the Instrument Factory, used to dislike the trouble of part-time students, but now he said in the workshop, "These are our own people. Now they are young workers in our factory, and they will be veteran workers in our factory when they grow up." There were nearly 20 young workers under the age of fifteen in the factory, all of whom entered the factory in the past because they had difficulty studying. Now that the factory and school have merged, the school is planning to insert them into appropriate classes for part-work and part-study.

    半工半读的一种新形式
    南京电讯仪表厂和南京三十三中学并为一家
    新华社南京电　南京电讯仪表厂和南京市第三十三中学合并，工人和学生都按时到车间生产和进课堂上课。
    厂校合并以后，学校教学进一步和实际相结合。教师到课堂上是班主任，到车间里是车间副主任，既要教学生，又要教工人。学校的文学、物理、化学、几何、数学等课程都结合生产实际，进行了彻底改革。如几何学，教员把几种基本图形结合收音机木壳的形状进行讲解，理化课把基本原理和分子式，结合厂校自己的钢铁炉形构造和炼钢炼铁的化学作用进行讲解。他们上午讲解，下午实习。学生反映，过去讲十遍不懂的东西，现在一遍就懂了。全校增设了无线电工艺课，教员由一位工厂老师傅带四个已经掌握了操作技术的学生担任。他们成立了研究小组，实行能者为师。在课程比重上，增加了政治、语文、数学的课时，减少了史地、音乐、美术和生理卫生的课时，缺少的课，以课外的讲座、俱乐部、红十字会等活动弥补。学生在下车间时，觉得自己是在直接进行生产，劲头更大。他们把过去按老规矩半年才能学会的技术，一周内就基本掌握了。
    厂校合并，也大大鼓舞了工人的干劲。电讯仪表厂是几个月前才由几个生产合作社合并起来的，没有机械设备，只能加工装配，不能生产制造。工人们常常感到，没有文化，自己的实际经验无法系统总结提高，厂小力薄，没有搞技术革命的勇气，厂校合并后，工人坐在教室里上课，胆子就壮了。他们表示也要用蚂蚁啃骨头的勇气和办法，自己制造设备，自己生产，第一批两台机床要在一周内完成。他们决心争取明年能成为年产十五万到二十万部收音机的大厂校。厂校合并后上第一堂文化课时，六十一岁的老工人刘冠军坐在头一排静听，老工人郑国坚、刘如珍在听了课后欢喜得一夜没睡着觉。工人们都有信心成为生产能手和优秀学员，做到能文能武，又红又专。目前，校部为他们设置的是初一、高一两个班，明年将添设大学班。
    厂校合并后，教学、生产都作了统一安排。原来工厂的全体工人，现在是两班制，每班生产和学习是八比四，即八小时生产、三小时半学习、半小时读报。等到新工人和学生操作熟练后，将逐步增加工人的学习时间。这个学校的学生，全部是初中生。二、三年级十二个班，学习和生产是四比四（不做夜班），每天上下午六个班轮班学习和生产。一年级四个班因学生年龄较小，每周三个下午分别担任小工厂、小农场、饲养、绿化、废品回收等生产劳动。同时，为了适应不同工种的需要，全校同一个年级的各个班，按年龄大小重新编了班，便于一个班集体行动。学生的劳动报酬，暂时用于集体福利和补助困难的优等生，明年逐步过渡到减免学费和餐费。
    初级中学实行半工半读，厂校一家，起初也为少数老师所反对。他们说，厂校合并将会把学校弄得一团糟，影响将来的发展。也有些人怀疑，厂校合并后，学生课堂学习时间减少，会降低教学质量，毕业时达不到要求。学校党支部针对这些问题，领导进行了大鸣大放大辩论，召开了家长座谈会，并对学生进行了物理、语文、几何等几门基本课程的测验。事实证明，学生因为联系了生产实际，开阔了思想，对很多问题的解答，都超过了先生所教的内容。学生蒋如林的家长看到自己十四岁的孩子功课好生产也好，喜欢地说，这样学生毕业后的前途将是广阔的，升高中，当工人，进中等技术学校都行。
    厂校合并，使工人和学生真正打成一片，融洽无间。过去，学生在工厂勤工俭学，工厂往往因为生产需要，很难细致地考虑到学生的年龄、体质、技能和经验等情况而予以照顾，因而时常发生学生勉强生产出来的成品不合格，双方都难满意。仪表厂金工车间老师傅丁贯山，过去对勤工俭学的学生嫌麻烦，可是现在他在车间里却说，这是我们自己人了，现在是咱们厂里的小工人，长大了也是咱们厂里的老师傅。厂里原有十五岁以下的青工近二十名，都是过去因念书困难而进厂的。现在厂校合并，校部正在打算把他们插在适当的班级里，半工半读。
