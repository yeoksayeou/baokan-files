The Party Cultivates Us into New People
——Notes on the Exhibition of Combining Education with Productive Labor
By Our Correspondent Bai Sheng

Wherever the Party's red flag is planted, there is victory, and wherever there is a miracle.

At the Exhibition of Combining Education with Productive Labor, what is presented to people is a vivid scene. Whether it is the moving scene of young people climbing to the peak of science with fruitful harvests, or the victories on the front line of teaching reform, one struggle after another, all eloquently demonstrate the enormous power unleashed under the leadership of the Party. The great victory of the educational revolution led by the Party has been achieved here. A group of communist new people, capable both intellectually and physically, have grown by leaps and bounds under the correct guidance of the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor.

　　The Concern and Guidance of the Leader
When I entered the hall of the Exhibition of Combining Education with Productive Labor, I stopped more than once at the many photos of Chairman Mao talking cordially and happily with young students and kindergarten children. Right under the photo of Chairman Mao standing in front of a machine tool and talking intimately with students from the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tianjin University, right in front of the huge proton cyclotron and magnetic tape return-type program-controlled machine tool, several young owners of the exhibits, the young teachers and students of Tianjin University who had once stood in the jubilant campus and cheered Chairman Mao, told me with their rich emotions, how, after Chairman Mao's inspection, they were full of excitement and pride, fighting day and night in the position of manufacturing the world's cutting-edge scientific products that they had never even seen before. The proton cyclotron, which was built in thirty-one days, an unprecedented feat in the world, is their best gift to thank Chairman Mao for his instructions and concern. It not only contributed to the great ideal of the motherland entering the atomic age, but also embodied the correctness and greatness of the Party's education policy in cultivating new people. Young graduating students Zhang Zongcheng and Zhang Jingyu both expressed their joy at being able to send the products they created with their own hands to the exhibition. They said that without the leadership of the Party and the power of the collective, without Chairman Mao's kind concern, it would have been impossible for them, ordinary young people, to create such a miracle!

I also stood for a long time in the Hunan Pavilion of the exhibition. Here, I saw the growth of Liu Weikong, a communist new person who grew up under the personal education of the Party leader Comrade Liu Shaoqi. Liu Weikong, nineteen years old, went to school in Beijing with her uncle-grandfather, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, after the liberation of Hunan in 1949. After graduating from Beijing Experimental Middle School last summer, she did not pass the university entrance examination. Comrade Shaoqi said to her, "You are the descendant of a revolutionary and should go to places where others don't want to go, to the most difficult places. Go home and participate in agricultural production, okay!" When Liu Weikong left Beijing, Comrade Shaoqi repeatedly told her, "Work hard after you go home." Now, we can see from the exhibition that young Liu Weikong has been repeatedly rated as an outstanding member of the youth shock team and a labor model because of her outstanding achievements in agricultural production, and was elected as a representative to the Second People's Congress of Hunan Province this year. Look at that photo at the exhibition: Liu Weikong, barefoot, carrying a hoe, and wearing a large straw hat, is such a healthy rural girl.

From Liu Weikong, we not only keenly see the Party leaders' concern and guidance for young people, but also see how young people are rapidly becoming communist new people under the Party's correct education policy.

The Party is thus constantly concerned about the growth of the younger generation. Look, aren't the photos of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, Lu Dingyi, Kang Sheng and other comrades inspecting school education in various places telling us again and again the Party's unparalleled concern for young people?

The Party Leads Us in Struggle
Without the leadership of the Party, socialist education is unthinkable. In implementing the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, it is not smooth sailing, but how many struggles have been experienced! Only under the leadership of the Party, through sharp struggles with bourgeois ideology, can great victories be achieved.

In a corner of the exhibition, people can see from two electric motors with distinctly contrasting sizes the sharp two-line struggle unfolded in the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor. This is an exhibit from Hefei University of Technology in Anhui. The explainer introduced it this way: Look! The 0.75-kilowatt motor trial-produced by the teachers is not working properly, and the 1,050-kilowatt motor produced by the students fully meets the standards! In front of this sharply contrasting exhibit, several students from Hefei University of Technology proudly and affectionately told the story of the victory of this struggle. That was when the school was vigorously engaged in production and scientific research not long ago. A group of second-year students from the Mining and Electrical Engineering Department who had not studied electrical engineering boldly proposed the initiative to trial-produce a 40-kilowatt motor under very difficult technical and equipment conditions. At that time, some bourgeois teachers who studied electrical engineering also reluctantly closed their doors to trial-produce a 0.75-kilowatt motor under the call of the Party. At that time, these bourgeois teachers mocked them and said, "We who study electrical engineering have not yet made a one-kilowatt motor, what can you make! If those who have not studied electrical engineering can also make motors, then we who study electrical engineering can get out!" But the students, under the strong leadership and support of the Party, resolutely overcame various difficulties and worked hard. When the students encountered difficulties in their work, the Party organization constantly gave them help and care, encouraging them to move forward. The workshop technicians also worked closely with the students. After seven days and seven nights of hard work, the 40-kilowatt motor was finally successfully trial-produced. At this time, the students loudly proposed to trial-produce a 1,050-kilowatt motor! But the bourgeois teachers poured cold water again and said, "It's okay to leap forward three or five steps, but it won't work to leap forward thirty or fifty steps." But what are the facts? The students, under the leadership of the Party, fought for more than a month, and a miracle was created again. Now this huge 1,050-kilowatt motor is on display at the exhibition.

In the Literature Department's Teaching Reform Exhibition Room, where the raging fire of teaching reform burned and burned away various bourgeois ideas, people can see how, under the leadership of the Party, young college students launched a sharp struggle against bourgeois teaching ideas and achieved a great harvest in teaching.

Let's first take a look at the teaching field of classical literature! Whether it is the exhibits from Peking University, Beijing Normal University, Shandong University, or Sun Yat-sen University, they all unanimously tell how young teachers and students relied on the leadership of the Party, exerted the power of the collective, and defeated the ideological toxins spread by bourgeois experts. A teacher at Beijing Normal University, when lecturing on Dream of the Red Chamber in class, he selected two articles, one was "Passionate Words to Test莽玉 (Mang Yu)," and the other was "Death of Daiyu." In his lectures, he tried his best to render the mood of pain and sadness, guiding the students to a spirit of depression and a sentimental state. At the exhibition, we even saw a female student, after listening to this teacher's explanation of Dream of the Red Chamber from a bourgeois point of view, actually used "Master of Xiaoxiang Pavilion" as her name and inscribed such words to hang on her bedside: "Life in this world, birth and death, death and birth." And she wrote in her diary: "Daiyu, you died, I feel pain and anger. … For so many years, I have been like you, … You still have a Zijuan who can sing and cry with you, but I am even more lonely. … Daiyu, only the moonlight and bamboo shadows quietly climbing out of the window and the unfortunate people of later generations accompany you, listening to your intermittent sobbing. …" Bourgeois teaching ideas are thus poisoning young people, guiding them to a decadent and declining outlook on life. The Party rescued her in time and guided her to a correct path in life. The Party organization fought against bourgeois teaching ideas, and kindly talked to her, criticized her thoughts, and mobilized her to participate in the mass movement of planting red flags and pulling out white flags in the field of classical literature teaching. After exposing and criticizing the various bourgeois teaching ideas among the teachers, in the face of a large number of facts, she thoroughly woke up. When she graduated this summer, she requested the Party to assign her to the remote frontier. Now she has joined the ranks of the great socialist construction of the motherland.

We proudly saw at the exhibition the large stacks of new teaching outlines and textbooks collectively compiled by young students after defeating bourgeois teaching ideas, which vividly and concretely introduced the glorious victory of the teaching reform struggle.

The Party Liberated Our Thinking
Whether it is the young people at Tsinghua University who manufacture program-controlled machine tools, or the young people at Peking University who built the 30 million electron volt induction accelerator, or the young people at Northeast Institute of Technology who manufacture fast electronic digital computers, they all said well: Without the Party leading us to liberate our minds, how can we imagine that this group of young people, who were poor and blank, could build the world's cutting-edge scientific products in such a short period of time! It is the beloved Party that taught us to be the masters of cutting-edge science with a communist style of daring to think and act. The Party gave us confidence and strength. When we encountered difficulties in our work, the Party gave us the greatest support, encouraging us to move forward more vigorously.

Among the thousands of scientific and technological products on display at the exhibition, whose scientific and technological level has reached the world's cutting-edge, people also saw the birth of the new type of lightning arrester. That was the creation of Ma Chizong, a third-year communist party member and student from a working-class background in the high-voltage major of the Electrical Engineering Department of Harbin Institute of Technology. This son of a poor peasant, who was once slandered by rightists as "eating for nothing" and "don't suffer in the university classroom anymore," could not even get enough chaff to eat in the old society. It was the Party that liberated him from a life worse than cattle and horses and cultivated him into a new person. When many factories and mines were worried about power outages in rainy days this summer because they could not buy lightning arresters, Ma Chizong immediately realized how serious this would be for production. He broke all superstitions and conservative ideas, and boldly proposed to find the way to manufacture high-performance new lightning arresters from those that had already been damaged. But at that time, the bourgeois teachers in the school's teaching and research section laughed at his fantasy. They said: "We can't even repair them, what kind of new type do you want to trial-produce! We have studied the literature for a long time, and we have not found a way to manufacture them!" But Ma Chizong did not waver. He repeatedly studied it, and he told the Party organization about his bold ideas. The Party immediately believed that this was a significant initiative to break superstitions and resolutely supported him, and mobilized the masses to research and cooperate with him to capture this cutting-edge of science and technology. The work of researching and trial-producing new lightning arresters began. After one failure after another, Ma Chizong and many students had not rested for several nights, but he was not discouraged. He thought, what are failures and setbacks! In these days and nights of forgetting fatigue, he and his classmates, under the care of the Party, went through 500 more experiments and finally successfully trial-produced the most important component of the new lightning arrester, the new non-linear resistor. When the world's first new lightning arrester with the strongest performance was born, some bourgeois teachers were still reading foreign literature, looking for ways to manufacture new lightning arresters!

The exhibition is full of socialist light, and also shows the great power of communist education and scientific research. In just one year, after the Party's red flag was victoriously planted all over the education front, what a huge change has taken place in the face of the motherland's schools! Unprecedented miracles in history have appeared here. Schools are running factories in a big way, and factories are running schools in a big way. Communist new people are growing up in batches under the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor. Under the leadership of the Party, they are leaping forward towards the great goal of communism!

    党培养我们成新人
    ——教育与生产劳动相结合展览会散记
    本报记者　柏生
    党的红旗插到哪里，哪里就有胜利，哪里就出现奇迹。
    在教育与生产劳动相结合展览会上，呈现在人们眼前的一片生动事实，无论是那年轻人攀登科学尖端胜利丰收的一片动人景象，还是那教学改革战线上，一个斗争接着一个斗争的胜利，都雄辩地说明了在党的领导下，发出的巨大威力。党领导的教育大革命在这里取得了伟大的胜利，一批共产主义能文能武的新人，在党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合的方针的正确指导下，飞跃地成长起来。
      领袖的关怀和教导
    当我走进教育与生产劳动相结合展览会的大厅，我曾不只一次地停留在那毛主席和青年学生、幼儿园孩子在一起亲切欢愉谈话的许多照片下。就在那幅毛主席站在机床前和天津大学机械系学生亲切谈话的照片下，就在那巨大的质子回旋加速器和磁带录返式程序控制机床前，几位年轻的展品主人，那曾经站在欢腾的校园中欢呼过毛主席的天津大学的年轻师生，用自己的丰富的感情，亲切地向我述说了他们在毛主席视察以后，是怎样满怀着激动和骄傲的心情，日夜战斗在制造那过去他们连看也没有看过的世界科学尖端产品的岗位上。那在世界上从没有过的用三十一天就建起的质子回旋加速器，就是他们答谢毛主席的指示和关怀的最好的献礼。它不仅为祖国进入原子化的美好理想贡献了一份力量，也在培养新人的道路上，体现了党的教育方针的正确和伟大。年轻的毕业班学生张总成和张敬宇，都诉说了他们能把亲手创造的产品，送到展览会上展出的喜悦。他们说，如果没有党的领导和集体的力量，没有毛主席的亲切关怀，他们这些平凡的青年人是不可能创造这样的奇迹的！
    我也曾久久地停立在展览会的湖南馆里。在这里，我看到了在党的领导者刘少奇同志亲自教育下成长起来的共产主义新人——刘维孔的成长。十九岁的刘维孔在1949年湖南解放后，就随叔祖父——刘少奇同志在北京上学。去年暑假她在北京实验中学高中毕业后，没有考上大学。少奇同志对她说：“你是一个革命者的后代，应该到人家不想去的地方去，到最困难的地方去。你回家参加农业生产去，好不好！”当刘维孔离开北京时，少奇同志又再三叮咛她：“回家后好好劳动”。现在，我们从展览会上，可以看到年轻的刘维孔由于在农业生产中做出了突出的成绩，屡次被评为青年突击队优秀队员、劳动模范，并在今年当选为湖南省第二届人民代表大会代表。你看，展览会上那张照片：赤着脚，扛着锄头，戴着大草帽的刘维孔是个多么健壮的农村姑娘了。
    从刘维孔的身上，我们不仅亲切地看到了党的领导者对青年的关怀和教导，也更看到了在党的正确的教育方针下，青年人是怎样迅速地成为共产主义的新人。
    党就是这样无时无刻不在关怀着青年一代的成长。你看，展览会上展出的党中央毛主席、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、邓小平、陆定一、康生等同志在各地视察学校教育的照片，不都是一次再一次亲切地告诉了我们党对青年人的无比关怀吗？
    党领导我们进行斗争
    没有党的领导，社会主义教育是不能设想的。在贯彻教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合的方针中，不是风平浪静，而是经过了多少的斗争呵！只有在党的领导下，经过和资产阶级思想的尖锐斗争，才能取得伟大胜利。
    在展览会的一角，人们从两台大小鲜明对比的电动机上，深刻地看到了在贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合方针中，展开的一场尖锐的两条道路的斗争。这是安徽合肥工业大学的展品，说明员这样介绍着：看！教师试制成的零点七五瓩电动机运转不灵，学生制成的一千零五十瓩的电动机完全符合标准！就在这鲜明对比的展品前，几个合肥工业大学的学生，骄傲而亲切地讲述了这场斗争胜利的故事。那是在不久前学校大搞生产和科学研究工作的时候，一群没有学过电机的矿山机电系二年级学生，在技术和设备十分困难的条件下，豪迈地提出了试制四十瓩电动机的倡议来。那时有几个学电机的资产阶级的教师在党的号召下，也无可奈何地闭门试制着一台零点七五瓩的电动机。当时这些资产阶级教师嘲笑他们说：“我们学电机的搞不到一瓩的电动机还没有搞好，你们能搞出什么名堂来！如果没学电机的也能造出电机来，那么我们学电机的可以滚蛋了！”但同学们在党的坚强领导和支持下，毅然地克服了各种困难，大干起来。党组织在同学工作遇到困难时，不断地给予他们帮助和关怀，鼓励他们向前迈进。车间技工也紧密地和同学们携手合作。经过七天七夜的苦战，四十瓩的电动机终于试制成功了，这时同学们紧跟着又响亮地提出了试制一千零五十瓩的电动机来！可是资产阶级的教师们竟又泼冷水似地说：“跃进三五步还可以，要想跃进三五十步可不行。”但事实怎样呢？同学们在党的领导下，战斗了一个多月，奇迹就又创造出来了。现在这台巨大的一千零五十瓩的电动机，就陈列在展览会上。
    在那燃起教学改革的熊熊烈火，烧掉形形色色的资产阶级思想的文学院教学改革展览室里，人们可以看到，在党的领导下，年轻的大学生是怎样和资产阶级教学思想展开了一场尖锐的斗争，取得了教学上的大丰收的。
    让我们先来看看古典文学的教学领域吧！无论是北京大学、北京师范大学，还是山东大学、中山大学的展品，都一致地道出了青年师生是怎样依靠党的领导，发挥了集体的力量，战胜了资产阶级专家所散布的思想毒素的。北京师范大学有一位教师，在课堂上讲红楼梦时，他选了两篇，一是“情辞试莽玉”，一是“黛玉之死”，在讲课中，他尽量地渲染着痛苦和凄凉的情调，引导同学走向精神萎蘼的伤感的境界。在展览会上，我们甚至看到了一个女同学听了这位教师以资产阶级的观点讲解红楼梦课以后，竟然用“潇湘馆主人”为名，题了这样的词句挂在自己的床头：“人生在世，生生死死、死死生生”。她并且写下了这样的日记：“黛玉，你死了，我感到沉痛和愤怒。……多少年了，我和你一样，……你还难得有个紫鹃能够同吟同泣，我却更加孤苦伶仃。……黛玉，只有悄悄爬出窗户的月光和竹影和后世的薄命者陪伴着你，听着你的断续的抽泣。……”资产阶级教学思想就是这样毒害着青年，引导她走上了颓废没落的人生观的道路。而党及时地挽救了她，把她指引到一条正确的人生道路上来。党组织对资产阶级的教学思想作了斗争，并且关怀地找她谈话，针对她的思想也进行了批判，发动她一起参加了在古典文学教学领域里插红旗、拔白旗的群众运动。在揭露和批判了教师中各种形形色色的资产阶级教学思想以后，在大量的事实面前，她彻底地清醒过来。当她今年暑假毕业时，她请求党把她分配到了遥远的边疆。现在她已参加到祖国伟大的社会主义建设行列里来。
    我们从展览会上，骄傲地看到了青年学生在战胜了资产阶级教学思想后，集体编写出来的一大叠一大叠新的教学大纲和教科书，它们生动而具体地介绍了教学改革这场斗争的辉煌胜利。
    党解放了我们的思想
    无论是制造程序控制机床的清华大学的年轻人，还是那建造三千万电子伏特感应加速器的北京大学的年轻人，还是制造快速电子数字计算机的东北工学院的年轻人，他们都说得好：没有党领导我们解放了思想，又怎能想像我们这一群一穷二白的青年人，能在这样短的时间，建起世界科学的尖端产品来呢！是亲爱的党教导我们以敢想敢干的共产主义风格，做尖端科学的主人。党给了我们信心和力量，当我们工作困难时，党给了我们最大的支持，激励着我们更加奋发前进。
    在那展览会上陈列的上千件科学技术水平已达世界尖端的产品里，人们也看到了那新型避雷器的诞生。那是哈尔滨工业大学电机系高压专业三年级的共产党员、工人出身的学生马持宗的创造。这个曾经被右派分子污为“白吃饭”、“不要在大学讲堂里再受罪”的贫农的儿子，在旧社会里连糠都吃不饱，是党把他从牛马不如的生活中解放出来，培养成新人。当今年夏季许多厂矿因买不到避雷器而发愁雨天就要停电的时候，马持宗立刻意识到这对生产将是个多么严重的问题，他打破一切迷信保守思想，大胆地提出从那些已经坏了的避雷器中，找出制作性能高强的新型避雷器的道路。但当时学校教研室里的资产阶级的教师嘲笑他是空想，他们说：连修理都修不好，还想试制什么新型的呢！我们从文献里研究了好久，都还没有找到一条制造的途径呢！但马持宗并没有动摇，他反复地钻研着，他把自己的大胆想法告诉了党组织，党立刻认为这是一个打破迷信意义重大的创举，坚决地支持了他，并发动群众和他一起研究合作，攻取这一科学技术上的尖端。研究试制新型避雷器的工作开始了。一次又一次的失败，马持宗和许多同学整整好几夜都没有休息了，但他并没有灰心，他想失败和挫折又算得什么呢！就在这忘掉了疲劳的日日夜夜里，他和同学们在党的关怀下又经过了五百次的试验，终于把新型避雷器中最重要的组成部分新型非线性电阻试制成功了。当这世界上第一个性能最强的新型避雷器诞生时，一些资产阶级的教师们还在那里翻阅着外国文献，寻找着制造新型避雷器的途径呢！
    展览会上，到处闪耀着一片社会主义的光芒，也显示了共产主义教育和科学研究的巨大力量。仅仅是一年的时间，当党的红旗胜利地插遍教育阵地以后，祖国学校的面貌就起了多么巨大的变化呵！历史上从来没有过的奇迹在这里出现了，学校大办工厂，工厂大办学校，共产主义的新人，在党的教育和生产劳动相结合的方针下，成批地成长起来。他们在党的领导下，正飞跃地向共产主义的远大目标前进！
