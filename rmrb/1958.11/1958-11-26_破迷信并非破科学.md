    Breaking Superstition is Not Breaking Science
    Ge De

    Some time ago, I went to see the Exhibition of New Achievements in Science and Technology. As the saying goes, experts watch for the details, and laymen watch for the excitement. Many people were there with notebooks, copying and recording things, and these were probably the experts. I, however, went to see the "excitement," that is, to see new things, to stimulate my thinking, which is actually being educated, not just simple enjoyment.
    After seeing it, I pondered the large slogan at the exit. "Science comes from practice, greatness comes from the ordinary." This is a truth. At the exhibition, I indeed saw the process of some scientific and technological achievements being born from practice, and I also saw some ordinary laborers who were also great inventors. But what I thought of was not just these two "comes from"s, but also two "surpasses"s.
    There is a Chinese idiom, "The indigo plant comes from blue, but is bluer than blue," and I think these two sentences at the exhibition can also be understood in this way.
    Science originates from practice; without practice, there is no science. This is not difficult to understand today. However, some empty-headed scientists in the past, who looked down on practice, made science very mysterious, creating superstition towards science. They regarded science and practice as being as far apart as the mortal and immortal realms, believing that only science, and only science divorced from practice, was the most sublime and valuable thing. They regarded scientific research as unattainable, as if only those who had left production practice could embark on the path of scientific research, just as only those who had cut off worldly ties could achieve immortality. Thus, billions of laborers and practitioners were separated from the field of scientific research by this mysterious curtain.
    Therefore, our Party mobilized the masses to break this superstition, to make people realize that all science originates from practice and is not mysterious at all; those empty-headed scientists are nothing special. This was precisely to strengthen the ambition of the working people and deflate the arrogance of the empty-headed scientists. As a result, not only was superstition broken, some fabricated and outdated scientific theorems were broken, but new development was brought to science. I saw a steady but swift stream of people running on the broad road of scientific research, and I also saw scientific flowers blooming all over the field. Who among those who love science could not jump for joy!
    However, breaking the superstition towards science is not to break science itself, but to treat science realistically and develop science. True science cannot be broken, nor can it be broken down; it will inevitably be respected by people, because whoever violates it will be badly hurt.
    Practice is the source of science, but practice itself is not science. Science still needs to be analyzed, synthesized, sorted out, and improved from rich practical materials. After the effort of "discarding the crude and selecting the refined, eliminating the false and retaining the true, proceeding from here to there, and from the outside to the inside," it is necessary to find out its inevitable laws. Therefore, science is more refined, more advanced, and more able to reflect the essence of things more completely than general and scattered practical results, so as to better guide practice. I think this is precisely where science surpasses the original practice. The meaning of "surpass" is not to be higher than everything, not "only science is high," but to be better, meaning it can better guide practice.
    Therefore, I think people should respect the scientific knowledge accumulated by predecessors through practice, and should be good at using and testing this knowledge in practice. After testing, the true must be retained, the insufficient must be developed, and the false must be broken. This is called having destruction, construction, and retention. Scientific theory is certainly not an eternal, unchanging thing, but must be continuously developed and supplemented in new practices to make it more complete. "The process of occurrence, development, and extinction in social practice is infinite, and the process of occurrence, development, and extinction in human cognition is also infinite." This is an absolute truth. But this does not mean that science is only passive; on the contrary, true science plays a huge guiding role in practice.
    Therefore, I believe that we must both break the superstition towards science and respect scientific knowledge; we must both develop science through practice and use science to guide practice. The two should not be separated. The view that only theory is needed and not practice and the view that only practice is needed and not theory are both to separate practice from science, and we must oppose both.
    Looking at the deeds of some new people introduced at the exhibition, it shows that they are people who neither are superstitious about old scientific theorems nor value scientific knowledge. They can both develop science in production practice and use scientific knowledge to guide their own practical activities. Therefore, they have created miracles. They dare to work and do not work blindly; they are familiar with the laws of things' activities, but they are not bound by conventions in their actions. They are diligent in practice, and they also seize the opportunity to study knowledge and technology. Therefore, they have achieved greater success than ordinary people, stood out from the ordinary, and become great innovators and inventors. Being diligent with both hands and brain, and emphasizing both theory and practice, this is probably also where "greatness surpasses the ordinary."

### 破迷信并非破科学

    破迷信并非破科学
    葛德
    前些时候，去看过科学技术新成就展览会。俗语说，行家看门道，外行看热闹。有不少人拿着小本子在那里抄写记载着什么，这大概就是行家了；而我却是去看“热闹”的，所谓看热闹，就是去看一看新鲜事物，借以启发一下思想，其实也就是受教育，并非单纯的赏心悦目而已。
    看完之后，我曾面对着出口处的大字标语深思过。“科学出于实践，伟大出于平凡”，这是一个真理。在展览会上，我的确看到了一些科学技术成果从实践中诞生的过程，也的确看到了一些平凡的劳动者而又是伟大的发明者的新人。但我想到的，却不只是这两个“出”字，而是另外还有两个“胜”字。
    中国有句成语，叫作“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”，我觉得展览会上的这两句话，也可以这样去理解。
    科学起源于实践，没有实践便没有科学，这在今天是不难理解的了。但是，以前一些轻视实践的空头科学家却把科学弄得非常神秘化，制造人们对于科学的迷信。他们把科学与实践看作是仙凡路隔，不可同语的，认为只有科学，而且只有脱离了实践的科学，才是最崇高最可贵的东西。把科学研究工作看得高不可攀，似乎只有离开了生产实践的人，才有可能走上科学研究的道路，就好像只有断绝红尘世俗的人才能修仙得道的一样。于是，亿万个劳动者，实践家们，便被这神秘的幕帐隔绝于科学研究领域之外了。
    于是，我们党就发动群众起来破除这种迷信。使人们认清所有科学都是起源于实践的，一点也不神秘；那些空头科学家们并没有什么了不起。这正是为了长劳动人民的志气，灭空头科学家的威风。结果不仅迷信被破除了，一些伪造的和过时了的科学定理被破除了，而且给科学带来了新的发展，我的眼前出现了在科学研究的阳关大道上坚实地但是迅跑着的人流，也看到了盛开遍野的科学的花朵。热爱科学的人，谁能不为此雀跃欢呼！
    但是，破除对于科学的迷信，并不是要破除科学本身，而正是为了实事求是地对待科学和发展科学。真正的科学，不能破除也破除不了，它必然会得到人们的尊重，因为谁违犯了它，谁就要碰得头破血流。
    实践是科学的来源，但实践本身还不是科学。科学还有待于从丰富的实践材料中去分析、综合、整理、提高，经过“去粗取精，去伪存真，由此及彼，由表及里”的工夫，找出它的必然规律来。因此，科学比起一般的分散的实践结果来更精粹、更高级、更能较完全地反映事物的本质，从而能够更好地去指导实践。我以为这正是科学胜于原来的实践的地方。“胜”的意思并不是高于一切，不是“唯有科学高”，而是胜过一筹，能更好的指导实践的意思。
    因此，我想到人们应该尊重前人的、通过实践所积累起来的科学知识，要善于运用并在实践中去检验这些知识。经过检验，真实的必须保留，不足的给予发展，虚伪的加以破除，这叫作有破有立有留。科学理论当然不是永恒的一成不变的东西，而是还要在新的实践中不断加以发展、补充、使它更加完全。“社会实践中的发生、发展和消灭的过程是无穷的，人的认识的发生、发展和消灭的过程也是无穷的。”这是一个绝对的真理。但这并不说明科学只是被动的；相反地，真正的科学恰恰是对实践起着巨大的指导作用。
    因此我以为，既要破除对于科学的迷信，又要尊重科学知识，既要通过实践去发展科学，又要用科学去指导实践，两者是不应该分离的。只要理论不要实践的观点和只要实践不要理论的观点，都是要使实践同科学脱离，我们都要反对。
    遍观展览会上介绍的一些新人的事迹，说明着他们正是一些既不迷信旧的科学定理，又看重科学知识的人，他们既能在生产实践中发展科学，又能运用科学知识指导自己的实践活动。因而他们创造了奇迹。他们敢干而并不盲干，熟悉事物的活动规律，却又不在行动上拘于陈规，他们勤于实践，而又抓紧钻研知识和技术，因此他们获得了较一般人更大的成功，从平凡中脱颖而出，成为伟大的革新者和发明家了。手脑俱勤，理论实践并重，这大概也正是“伟大胜于平凡”的地方吧。
