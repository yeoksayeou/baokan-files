    The Banner of Water and Soil Conservation—Huajialing
    Past: Barren slopes, extremely cold, sparsely populated. Present: Terraced fields cover the mountains, orchards and gardens connect in vast expanses.
    (Our report) Through the collaboration of four counties, more than 30,000 people waged a major battle at Huajialing, establishing a high-standard banner for water and soil conservation.
    Huajialing is the highest major ridge along the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway. The ridge is covered with barren slopes and deep gullies, shrouded in heavy fog, perennially frigid, and sparsely populated. In the past, when people traveled by car over the ridge, they considered it a daunting journey. However, now the ridge is covered with terraced fields, and orchards and gardens connect in vast expanses.
    The transformation of Huajialing is the result of an eleven-day campaign by 37,000 people from the four counties of Tongwei, Dingxi, Huining, and Jingning in Gansu. To build Huajialing into a new socialist mountainous area, and change the face of the ridge’s barren gullies and slopes and low crop yields, these more than 37,000 people from the four counties embarked on an expedition to Huajialing on October 12th. In just eleven days, they constructed 22 mountaintop parks, 284,600 mu of terraced fields, planted trees and grass on 3,120 mu, and deeply cultivated 126,600 mu of land in conjunction with terracing. Every project in the parks was premised on water and soil conservation, but it was not only a water and soil conservation project, but a combination of orchards, gardens, and vegetable gardens.
    On the Huajialing project, the Party and League branches of each corps simultaneously ran construction site Party schools and Red and Expert schools, while also rectifying the Party, the League, and the communes. Political and cultural education was also moved to the work areas. Before the start of the project and during construction, communist ideological education was widely carried out, with debates on topics such as "How to cure Huajialing" and "Whose communist style is higher," resulting in 1.53 million big-character posters.
    Resolutely implementing the mass line ensured the rapid progress and high quality of this project. Initially, the leadership had no experience in managing the ridge, nor were there any examples of landscaping to emulate. Therefore, they gave the problem to the masses for discussion, learning from the masses, and building an "August 1st Park" on a mountaintop, gaining experience in managing ridges, hillocks, and landscaping. Secondly, facing the problem of a small number of engineering technicians and a large work area, making it impossible to plan and guide every site, the leadership also boldly mobilized the masses to plan and design themselves. As a result, the masses created experiences in managing slopes and ridges such as "for uneven terrain on barren slopes, adopt the strategy of 'Qi Wang's random deployment of troops.'" These experiences were promptly promoted on the construction site, not only ensuring the engineering standards but also accelerating the pace.
    Currently, the Huajialing project is still underway. The 37,000-strong army is determined to wage another hundred-day battle to fully terrace and landscape Huajialing. (Luo Shan, Wang Peilan)

    水土保持的旗帜——华家岭
    过去：荒坡奇寒人烟稀少　现在：满山梯田园林连片
    本报讯　四县协作，三万多人大战华家岭，树水土保持高标准的旗帜。
    华家岭是西（安）、兰（州）公路上最高的一个大岭，岭上到处是荒坡大沟，云雾重重，常年奇寒，人烟稀少。过去，当人们乘汽车路过岭时，都视为畏途。可是，现在岭上已经满山梯田，园林连片。
    华家岭的变化是甘肃通渭、定西、会宁和静宁四县三万七千人大战十一天的结果。这四个县的三万七千多人民为了把华家岭建设成为共产主义的新山区，改变岭上荒沟荒坡和作物低产的面貌，从10月12日起远征华家岭，只十一天功夫，修成山顶公园二十二个，梯田二十八万四千六百亩，植树种草三千一百二十亩，结合修梯田深翻地十二万六千六百亩，公园的每一项工程，都以保持水土为前提，但它又不仅是水土保持工程，是果园、花园和菜园的结合。
    在华家岭的工程上，各兵团的党团支部一面开办工地党校、红专学校，一面整党整团整社。政治文化教育也搬到了工区。在工程未开工前和施工过程中，普遍展开了共产主义思想教育，以“如何治好华家岭”“谁的共产主义风格高”等为题展开了大辩论。辩论中出大字报一百五十三万张。
    坚决贯彻群众路线，使这次工程进展快和质量高。最初，领导上没有治岭的经验，也没有园林化的榜样可效，于是把问题交给群众讨论，向群众学习，在一个山顶上建起一座“八一公园”，得出了治岭治峁和园林化的经验。其次对工程技术人员少，工区面大，不能对每一个现场作出规划并进行指导的问题，领导上也是放手发动群众，由群众自规划、自设计，结果由群众创造出“荒坡地伏势不平，采用齐王乱点兵”等治坡治岭经验，这些经验，都及时地在工地进行了推广，不仅保证了工程标准，而且加快了速度。
    目前华家岭的工程还在继续进行中，三万七千大军，决心再大战一百天，使华家岭完全梯田化、园林化。（罗山、王培兰）
