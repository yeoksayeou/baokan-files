Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 5th. This year, the total housing area constructed in the Soviet Union is equivalent to forty cities, each capable of accommodating 100,000 residents. On average, a five-story building with forty to fifty apartments is completed every twenty minutes, and more than 20,000 people move into new homes every day.

    Since the revolution, the Soviet Union has continuously carried out housing construction. The area of housing built in the past forty-one years is approximately four times the original housing area before the revolution. The speed of housing construction is accelerating. In 1956, the country completed new housing with an area of 36.9 million square meters, roughly equivalent to the total residential area of Moscow today. In 1957, 48 million square meters were completed, about the total residential area of ​​Kiev, Baku, Kharkov, Gorky, Sverdlovsk, and Chelyabinsk. In the first eight months of this year alone, the housing built with state investment increased by another 3 million square meters compared to the same period last year.

    Reducing construction costs and shortening construction time are the common slogans of the labor competition among Soviet construction workers. They have put forward guarantees in this regard as a gift to the 21st Party Congress. In the first half of this year, the construction workers of the Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Enterprise Construction Bureau reduced the construction cost of each square meter of housing by 150 rubles, thus saving the state 6.75 million rubles. This money can be used to build two five-story buildings with 70 apartments each.

    In order to increase the speed of housing construction, the installation of large wall panels is being used more and more this year. This means pre-fabricating various sizes of reinforced concrete wall panels in factories and then transporting them to the construction site for installation. Using wall panels the size of a room, a floor can be built in six days.

    The method of mobilizing the masses to build their own houses is being promoted. In one year, the working people of Lviv built 700 low-rise buildings with their own efforts, with a total area of ​​71,000 square meters. The masses build their own houses quickly and cheaply.

### 苏联住宅建设多快好省  四十一年建成住宅等于革命前原有住宅四倍

    苏联住宅建设多快好省
    四十一年建成住宅等于革命前原有住宅四倍
    新华社莫斯科5日电　今年全苏联建设的住宅面积相当于四十座各能容纳十万居民的城市，平均每二十分钟建成一幢有四、五十套住宅的五层大楼，每天有二万多人迁入新住宅。
    苏联在革命后不断进行住宅建设，四十一年来所建成住宅的面积约相当于革命前原有住宅面积的四倍。住宅建设的速度越来越快，1956年全国建成新住宅的面积是三千六百九十万平方公尺，约等于今天莫斯科的全部住宅面积，1957年建成四千八百万平方公尺，约等于基辅，巴库，哈尔科夫，高尔基，斯维德洛夫斯克和车里雅宾斯克住宅面积的总和，而今年头八个月单是由国家投资建成的住宅又比去年同期增加三百万平方公尺。
    降低建设成本和缩短建设时间是目前苏联建筑工人劳动竞赛的共同口号。他们在这方面纷纷提出保证作为对二十一次党代表大会的献礼。车里雅宾斯克冶金企业建设局的建筑工人们今年上半年使每一平方公尺住宅的建设成本减少了一百五十卢布，因而替国家节省了六百七十五万卢布，用这笔钱可以建造两幢各有七十套住宅的五层楼房。
    为了使住宅建设的速度提高，今年各地愈来愈多采用大型墙板安装法，就是预先在工厂制好各种大小钢筋水泥的墙板，然后运到工地上安装。用相当于一间房子大小的墙板安装，六天就可造好一层楼。
    发动群众自己动手建造住宅的办法正在推广。利沃夫市的劳动人民在一年中就用自己的力量建成了七百幢低层楼房，总面积是七万一千平方公尺，群众自己动手造住宅既快又便宜。
