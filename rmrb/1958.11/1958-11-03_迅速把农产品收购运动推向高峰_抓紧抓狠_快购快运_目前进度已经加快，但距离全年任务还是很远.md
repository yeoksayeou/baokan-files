Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Amidst the new situation of an unprecedented bumper harvest of agricultural products across the country, many regions have reported initial successes in the procurement and transportation of agricultural products, and a mass agricultural product procurement campaign is taking shape. In some areas, a procurement high tide of "satellites" being launched and "red flags" fluttering has emerged. This is a new atmosphere in commercial work after various localities implemented the emergency instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on October 22 regarding "rushing to complete the task of agricultural product procurement and transportation."

Since late October, the procurement progress of major agricultural products has accelerated significantly. Cotton procurement in late October was 1.1 million dan, an increase of 2.2 times compared to mid-October. According to incomplete statistics, from September to the end of October, approximately 21 million dan of ginned cotton have been procured nationwide. For flue-cured tobacco, the procurement progress in late October in the seven major producing areas across the country accelerated by two times compared to mid-October. The procurement volume of live pigs surged from 20,000 to 30,000 heads per day in mid-October to 130,000 heads. The amount of autumn grain purchased and stored has also begun to increase.

Currently, the development of the campaign in various regions is uneven. The provinces of Henan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Shandong generally have faster procurement progress. Among the 122 counties and cities in Henan Province, 107 counties and cities have launched a high tide of autumn grain storage, with an average daily storage volume of over 100 million jin. The Shangqiu, Xinxiang, and Xuchang special districts have all completed the annual autumn grain procurement tasks ahead of schedule. As of the end of October, the province's cotton procurement task had reached 69% of the annual plan, an increase of more than double the procurement volume in the same period last year. From October 24 to the end of the month, Hebei Province launched a vigorous agricultural product procurement and sales sprint week, achieving brilliant results. All special districts launched "satellites" of procurement work. For example, in the Shijiazhuang special district, twelve counties have completed the autumn grain storage task, eight counties have overfulfilled the ginned cotton procurement task, and eleven counties and cities have launched "satellites" of procuring 1,000 pigs per day. As of October 28, the amount of grain stored in Heilongjiang Province had increased by 55% compared to the same period last year, and the average daily storage volume had increased by two to three times compared to last year. Regions with slower procurement progress are also taking various effective measures to strengthen their work.

In order to ensure the unimpeded flow of the "Marshal" of steel, many regions have adopted a combination of blitz transportation and regular transportation, combining modern means of transportation with folk means of transportation, and strengthened the transportation of agricultural products. In order to ensure the grain supply of large cities, Hunan Province first prioritized the transportation of grain along the province's transportation lines to large cities according to the state's dispatch plan, and then arranged for the needs of the province. In October, the province overfulfilled the outbound transfer task by 3 million jin. Anhui Province concentrated 280 million jin of grain along the transportation lines in a few days, preparing for outbound transfer. In addition to completing the annual live pig outbound transfer task as early as July, the province recently transferred nearly 200,000 more live pigs to supply cities such as Liaoning, Beijing, and Shanghai.

The improvement in the procurement and transportation of agricultural products is primarily due to the fact that the Party committees in various regions have earnestly implemented the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and strengthened their leadership over the procurement and transportation work. After the central government issued its instructions, all provinces and regions generally held various forms of emergency meetings to redeploy and rearrange the procurement and sales work. Many provinces established special offices or command posts, with the leaders of the Party committees in charge of finance and trade personally taking charge, and dispatched large numbers of cadres to go to the countryside to inspect, supervise, and provide specific assistance. At the same time, they also established necessary reporting and evaluation systems. After taking these specific measures, many provinces have firmly grasped the procurement work, and the campaign is progressing smoothly.

Secondly, many regions have emphasized putting politics in command and doing ideological work well in procurement work, so that commercial workers and the broad masses of people have a deep understanding of the important significance of rushing to procure agricultural products, and criticized various forms of passive waiting. When Suixian County, Hubei Province, began rushing to collect grain for storage, some cadres believed that "one hand can only catch one fish" and "we are engaged in both steelmaking and autumn harvesting and planting, where is the strength to grab grain?" In response to these ideas, the county party committee organized a major debate. Through the debate, it was found that there was great potential for labor. For example, a team in the Rocket Commune in the county found 63 laborers because the team had never included cooks, rice millers, captains, accountants, etc. when calculating labor in the past. Based on this experience, 130,000 laborers were found throughout the county, and two high tides of rushing to deliver grain were organized, which resulted in becoming a "red flag county" for autumn grain storage.

Thirdly, the masses have been widely mobilized in procurement and transportation work in various regions, forming a massive mass movement. Seizing the gaps in the tense steel production and deep plowing of land, millions of laborers are rushing to pick cotton, deliver cotton, and transport grain every day. The key cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province present a busy scene of "red flags fluttering during the day for picking cotton, bright lights shining at night for delivering cotton, men, women, old and young are all mobilized, picking cotton and delivering cotton non-stop." Currently, the province has organized an army of nearly 4 million people to pick and deliver cotton, and has put them into battle. The labor force in Hubei Province engaged in transporting grain has reached 2 million people, and the province has also transferred more than 58,000 various vehicles and more than 30,000 civilian ships, racing against time to carry out the work of transporting and delivering grain and cotton.

However, the improvement in the procurement and transportation of agricultural products is only a beginning. Compared with the annual procurement task, whether it is grain, cotton, tobacco, or hemp, it is still far from the annual task. The allocation plans for cotton and grain in September and October have not been completed. Therefore, the tasks for the next two months are still very arduous. Various regions must continue to exert their efforts, take advantage of every opportunity, and seize every moment. While engaging in steelmaking and agriculture on a large scale, the mass procurement and transportation campaign should be carried out more extensively and in-depth. Turn the "satellites" in procurement and transportation work into large-scale harvests, and raise the red flag of procurement and transportation work higher and higher. (Attached picture)

    迅速把农产品收购运动推向高峰
    抓紧抓狠　快购快运
    目前进度已经加快，但距离全年任务还是很远
    据新华社2日讯　在全国农产品空前丰收的新形势下，许多地区农产品的收购、调运工作已初报捷音，一个群众性的农产品收购运动正在形成；某些地区已经出现了“卫星”齐放、“红旗”飘扬的收购高潮，这是最近各地贯彻执行了10月22日中共中央和国务院关于“突击完成农产品收购调运任务”的紧急指示后，在商业工作上出现的新气象。
    10月下旬以来，主要农产品的收购进度显著加快。棉花10月下旬收购一千一百万担，比中旬增加二点二倍。据不完全统计，从9月到10月底，全国已收购皮棉约二千一百万担。烤烟，全国七个主要产区，10月下旬的收购进度比中旬加快了二倍。生猪的收购量从中旬的日收二、三万头猛增到十三万头。秋粮征购入库数也开始有所增加。
    目前各地运动发展得还不平衡，河南、河北、黑龙江、贵州、安徽、浙江、湖南、山东等省一般收购进度较快。河南省的一百二十二个县市中已有一百零七个县、市掀起了秋粮入库高潮，每天平均入库量在一亿斤以上。商丘、新乡、许昌三个专区都已提前超额完成了全年秋粮征购任务；这个省的棉花收购任务到10月底已完成年计划的69％，比去年同期的收购量增加了一倍以上。河北省从10月24日到月底，开展了一个轰轰烈烈的农产品购销突击周，取得了辉煌战果，各专区都放出了收购工作的“卫星”，如石家庄专区已有十二个县全部完成秋粮入库任务，八个县超额完成皮棉收购任务，还有十一个县、市放出日收千头猪的“卫星”。黑龙江省截至10月28日，已经入库的粮食比去年同期增加了55％，每天平均入库量比去年增加二、三倍。收购进度较慢的地区，也正在采取各种有效措施，加强工作。
    不少地区在保证钢铁“元帅”畅行无阻的前提下，采取了突击运输和经常运输相结合，现代运输工具和民间运输工具相结合的措施，加强了农产品调运工作。湖南省为了保证大城市粮食供应，首先把省内交通沿线的粮食按照国家调度计划，优先调运给大城市，然后再安排本省的需要。10月份这个省超额三百万斤完成了外调任务。安徽省在几天内就向交通沿线集中了二亿八千万斤粮食，准备外调。这个省除了早在7月份就完成了全年生猪外调任务外，最近又增调了近二十万头生猪供应辽宁、北京、上海等城市。
    农产品收购、调运情况的好转，首先是由于各地党委认真贯彻执行了中共中央和国务院的指示，加强了对收购、调运工作的领导。各省区在中央发出指示后普遍召开了各种形式的紧急会议，对购销工作重新作了部署和安排，许多省成立了专门的办公室或指挥部，由党委主管财贸工作的负责人亲自挂帅，并派出大批干部下乡检查、督促和具体帮助工作；同时还建立了必要的汇报评比制度。许多省在采取了这些具体措施后，已经狠狠地把收购工作抓了起来，运动正在顺利展开。
    其次，不少地区在收购工作上强调了政治挂帅，做好思想工作，使商业工作人员和广大群众都深入了解突击收购农产品的重要意义，批判了形形色色的消极等待思想。湖北省随县开始突击征粮入库时，有些干部认为“一只手只能抓一条鱼”、“又搞钢铁又搞秋收秋种，那里有力量再抓粮食？”县委针对这些思想，组织了大辩论，通过辩论发现劳动力潜力很大，如该县火箭公社一个队就找出了六十三个劳动力，因为队里过去在计算劳动力的时候，一直没有把炊事员、碾米员、队长、会计等包括在内。根据这一经验，全县挖掘出了十三万个劳动力，组织了两次突击送粮的高潮，结果就成为秋粮入库的“红旗县。”
    再次，各地在收购和调运工作中普遍发动了群众，形成了声势浩大的群众运动。抓住紧张的钢铁生产和深翻土地的空隙，每天都有数百万劳动大军在突击摘棉、送棉、运粮。河北省重点产棉区呈现了“白天摘棉红旗飘、夜间送棉明灯照、男女老幼齐动员、摘棉送棉不停闲”的繁忙景象。目前这个省已经组织了一支近四百万人的摘棉、送棉大军，投入了战斗。湖北省投入调运粮食工作的劳动力已达二百万人，全省还调出各种车辆五万八千多辆，民船三万多只，分秒必争地展开了运、送粮棉的工作。
    但是，目前农产品收购、调运情况的好转还仅仅是一个开始，与全年收购任务比较，无论粮食、棉花、烟、麻距离全年任务都很远；9、10月份棉、粮的调拨计划也都没有完成，因此今后两个月的任务仍然是十分繁重的。各地必须继续鼓足干劲，见空就钻、看缝插针，在大搞钢铁、大搞农业的同时，让群众性收购和调运运动开展得更广泛、更深入；把收购调运工作中的“卫星”，变成大面积丰收；使收购调运工作的红旗越举越高。（附图片）
