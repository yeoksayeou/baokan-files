Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: The Hecheng Brigade of the Satellite Commune in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, led by the Party Branch Secretary, adheres to the principle of democratic management of the canteen, running it in an orderly manner, so that the commune members eat their fill, eat well, and are satisfied.

The Hecheng Brigade Party Branch adopted the measures of "three personnel, five reforms" to improve the canteen management. Three personnel means that the canteen staff are not only cooks, but also feeders and planters. The canteen operates a total of 42 mu of vegetable gardens, which not only ensures that the commune members have enough fresh vegetables to eat every day, but also sells more than 40,000 jin. The Canteen Management Committee is composed of seven people, including democratically elected commune member representatives and cook representatives. The main task of the Management Committee is to help plan, implement revenue and expenditure accounting, check accounts, listen to the reflections and demands of the masses, and hold regular meetings to study and improve canteen work. Recently, the committee carried out "five reforms" according to the needs of the commune members: First, change from no plan to a plan, implement "know what to eat early." The canteen has a ten-day plan and a three-day arrangement, so that every commune member knows what rice and vegetables to eat. Second, change single meals to a variety of meals. Third, change eating in the open air to eating in the dining hall. Fourth, change eating on time to eating as soon as you arrive, fixed seats, no queuing, no crowding, no waiting. Fifth, take care of the sick, the old, women and children, and the nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, schools, etc. are open in seven places. This not only ensures order, no rush and no chaos, but also facilitates work and labor. For patients, the canteen uses small stoves to cook seasoned porridge, which is delivered to the bedside by the cooks or taken back by family members. For women who have just given birth, the canteen gives oil, glutinous rice, etc. for them to use as they see fit. The canteen also stipulates ways to take care of foreign guests, commune members who are away on business, and commune member families with happy events. After the "five reforms," the canteen is more consolidated, and the commune members said: "Our canteen really cannot be blown down by typhoons, cannot be broken up by iron bars, how can one household be so thoughtful!"

According to Jiangxi Daily, the four canteens of the Jibu Company of the Rocket People's Commune in Ganxian County implement democratic management and constantly improve their work, achieving universal satisfaction.

The public canteen is a mass collective life organization, and democratic management must be done well. Therefore, these four canteens have all established management committees, with a platoon leader serving as the director of the food committee, soliciting opinions from commune members at any time, and holding regular meetings to summarize achievements, promote experience, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Each canteen has formulated a management system, and financial accounts are summarized every half month, a major summary every month, and announced once a month. Management personnel are selected based on political reliability and strong ability. The conditions for cooks are not only political reliability, but also hard work, attention to cleanliness and hygiene, good health, and the skill of cooking. A competition was also organized between the canteens, such as the public canteen of the Second Platoon put forward the slogan of "three goods and one more": namely, "First, compare eating well and eating enough; Second, compare good cleanliness and hygiene; Third, compare good vegetable garden management"; one more is "more varieties of vegetables to eat". The commune members also put forward a code of conduct, supervising each other, so that everyone runs the canteen and everyone has a responsibility.

Public canteens must ensure that commune members eat well, eat their fill, and save money, so as to facilitate commune members and benefit them, so that they can be consolidated. At the beginning, due to lack of experience, the canteen was very strict on some issues, such as steaming rice in bowls according to the quantitative standard, resulting in those with a large appetite not getting enough to eat, and those with a small appetite not finishing it, and taking it home to feed chickens and ducks, and the commune members who did not get enough to eat had opinions. After research, the Party Branch and the Food Committee believed that it was necessary to further improve operation and management, first of all, change to eating from the big pot, which not only everyone supported, but also saved grain. At the same time, the method of assigning seats according to households was cancelled, and eight people were established per table, voluntarily combined, and eating as soon as they arrived. Secondly, adjust the life according to the needs of production and the customs of the masses, adding oil and meat when farming is busy and tiring, and the food is better. Individuals who are sick or it is raining and cannot come to the canteen can take it back to eat. In order to take care of the elderly and children, after the autumn harvest, it is planned to establish canteens for the elderly and children.

    办好食堂　人人有责
    火箭卫星两公社抓住办食堂主要环节
    据新华社南京17日电　江苏省盐城县卫星公社合兴中队由党支部书记挂帅，坚持民主管理食堂的原则，把食堂办得井井有条，使社员吃得饱，吃得好，人人满意。
    合兴中队党支部采取“三员、五改”的措施，来改进食堂管理。三员，就是食堂的工作人员既是炊事员，又是饲养员和种植员。食堂一共经营了四十二亩菜园，不但使社员天天有足够的新鲜蔬菜吃，而且还卖出四万多斤。食堂管理委员会是由民主选举社员代表、炊事员代表等七人组成的。管理委员会的任务主要是帮助计划，实行收支核算，检查账目，听取群众的反映和要求，定期召开会议研究改进食堂工作。最近委员会就根据社员的需要进行了“五改”：一、改无计划为有计划，实行“吃饭早知道”。食堂十天一计划，三天一安排，使社员个个晓得吃的饭和菜。二、改一样饭菜为多样饭菜。三、改露天吃为饭堂吃。四、改按时吃饭为随到随吃，固定坐位，不排队、不拥挤、不等候。五、照顾病老妇幼，托儿所、幼儿园、幸福院、学校等分七处开饭。这样不但做到秩序井然，不忙不乱，而且有利于工作和劳动。对病人，食堂用小锅灶煮调味的粥，由炊事员送到床边，或由家属打回去。对产妇，食堂发给油、糯米等，由她自己支配。对于外来的客人、出外有事的社员以及社员家有喜事，食堂也都规定了照顾的办法。“五改”以后，食堂更加巩固了，社员们说：“我们的食堂真是台风吹不动，铁棒打不散，一家一户那有这样周到！”
    据江西日报消息　赣县火箭人民公社吉埠连的四个食堂，实行民主管理，不断改进工作，做到了人人满意。
    公共食堂是群众集体生活组织，必须搞好民主管理。因此，这四个食堂都成立了管理委员会，由一个排长兼膳食委员会主任，随时征求社员意见，定期召开会议，作到及时总结成绩，推广经验，发现和解决问题。每个食堂都订出管理制度，财务帐目半月一小结，一月一大结，一个月公布一次。管理人员都是选择政治可靠，能力较强的担任。炊事员的条件，不但要政治可靠，而且要刻苦耐劳，重视清洁卫生，身体健康，有作饭作菜的技术。食堂之间还组织了竞赛，如二排的公共食堂提出比三好一多：即“一比吃得饱，吃得好；二比清洁卫生好，三比菜园管理好”；一多是“吃菜的花样多”。社员也提出了生活公约，互相监督，做到人人办食堂，个个有责任。
    公共食堂必须保证社员吃的好，吃的饱，又省钱，达到便利社员，有利于社员，才能巩固下来。开始，由于缺乏经验，食堂对有些问题卡的紧，如按定量标准用钵子蒸饭，出现饭量大的吃不饱，量小的吃不完，带回家去喂鸡、鸭，吃不饱的社员就有意见。党支部和膳食委员会经过研究，认为必须进一步改进经营管理，首先改吃大锅饭，不但大家拥护，而且粮食有节余。同时取消了按户排座，建立八个人一桌，自愿结合，随到随吃的办法。其次，根据生产需要和群众的风俗习惯调剂生活，农忙活累加油加肉，伙食好一点。个别因病或天下雨，不能来食堂的可以打回去吃。为了照顾年老和小孩，秋收结束后，准备成立老年、儿童食堂。
