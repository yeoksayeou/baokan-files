Everyone Sings and Dances in Praise of the East Wind
　　Wang Shuigen, worker at Luoyang Tractor Factory

　　The East Wind blows away the clouds in the sky,
　　Ten thousand miles of sky, the sun rises high.
　　Moscow, thunder in spring,
　　Rockets fly to the ninth heaven.
　　Red satellites shock the earth,
　　Chang'e takes the lead out of the palace gate.
　　Songs rise from all over the country,
　　The East Wind overwhelms the West Wind.
　　The East Wind blows across the Pacific,
　　The American President is dizzy.
　　Seeing a light, he thinks it's a rocket,
　　He needs a heart stimulant every day.
　　The East Wind blows to Washington,
　　Big and small officials are in a panic.
　　The much-touted Vanguard is collapsing,
　　Turning to dust with one somersault.
　　The East Wind sweeps away the West Wind in gusts,
　　The American economy is like a mountain collapsing.
　　Six million unemployed workers,
　　Selling blood, selling lives, selling eyes.
　　The East Wind crosses London City,
　　Workers are striking everywhere.
　　Anti-American sentiment is sky-high,
　　Missile bases are difficult to build.
　　The East Wind blows all over Asia,
　　A dragon rises in the East.
　　Both hands split open thousands of roads,
　　The river reverses its flow, creating miracles.
　　Steel peaks rise from the ground,
　　Ten-thousand-ton freighters will be completed soon.
　　A hundred catties of cotton, a thousand catties of grain,
　　Ten thousand miles of rivers and mountains, a sea of red.
　　The light of peace shines on the universe,
　　The people can fill the sea.
　　Thinking of the Communist Party with all our hearts,
　　Everyone sings and dances in praise of the East Wind.

    人人歌舞赞东风
    洛阳拖拉机厂工人　王水根东风吹散满天云，万里天空太阳升。莫斯科，春雷动，火箭飞上九霄云。红色卫星惊天地，嫦娥带头出宫门。天南地北歌声起，万里东风压西风。东风吹过太平洋，美国总统头发昏。看见灯光当火箭，天天要打强心针。东风吹到华盛顿，大小官员乱哄哄。大吹大擂先锋号，一个斤斗化灰尘。东风阵阵扫西风，美国经济像山崩。失业工人六百万，卖血卖命卖眼睛。东风跨过伦敦城，工人到处闹罢工。反美情绪高万丈，导弹基地难建成。东风吹遍亚细亚，东方飞起一条龙。双手劈开千条路，江水倒流创奇闻。钢铁山峰平地起，万吨巨轮指日成。百斤皮棉千斤粮，万里江山一片红。和平光芒照宇宙，人民能把海填平。心心想着共产党，人人歌舞赞东风。
