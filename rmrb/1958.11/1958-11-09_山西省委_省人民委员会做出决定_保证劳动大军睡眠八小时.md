The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee made a decision on November 5th regarding guaranteeing the labor force eight hours of sleep per day, in order to enable the labor force to maintain strong morale for a long time during the three years of hard work, and to carry out continuous production with both work and rest.

The decision pointed out: Since the all-round great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production last winter, especially since the great effort in steel production in September and the concentrated efforts in autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and deep plowing, the communist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the people of the province have been unprecedentedly enhanced. Men and women, young and old, are all participating in labor. In many places, the number of people attending work accounts for 80% to 90% of the local population. Everyone is working with soaring enthusiasm and selflessness, and few people care about working hours, work quotas, or labor remuneration. This communist spirit and work attitude is very precious and should be maintained and promoted. In order to ensure that socialist construction proceeds rhythmically and that people's labor involves both work and rest, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee instructed party organizations and people's governments at all levels to cherish the labor enthusiasm of the labor force in their hard work and practical efforts, and to pay close attention to the rest of the labor force, especially the sleep of the labor force. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee believe that, under normal circumstances, it is necessary to guarantee the labor force eight hours of sleep per day. The decision emphasized: Guaranteeing the labor force eight hours of sleep per day will not only ensure sustained production, but also enable the laboring people's physical fitness to be strengthened day by day and labor efficiency to be improved day by day, which is of great significance for building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way.

The decision pointed out: Guaranteeing the labor force eight hours of sleep per day is a major issue related to the lives of millions of laboring people and socialist construction. Party organizations and people's governments at all levels must use the quickest method to convey this decision to every grassroots organization of the labor force and ensure its resolute implementation.

Currently, party and government leading organs at all levels throughout the province are actively taking measures to implement this decision. The Yuci, Changzhi, and Jinan prefectural party committees have decided to combine steel base consolidation with the construction of simple houses to further improve the accommodation and dining conditions of the steel labor force, ensuring a quiet and comfortable sleeping environment everywhere so everyone can rest well. The Hongzhao County Party Committee has decided that hard work and night work should generally not exceed seven days per month, and there should be three days per month for political, cultural, and personal activities for commune members. The normal production time for commune members should generally account for two-thirds of the entire month. Each time the commune organizes its members to carry out concentrated production activities, it should generally not exceed two days and nights; during concentrated production activities, efforts should generally be made to ensure six hours of sleep per day. Under normal production conditions, the general sleep time should be eight hours per day. It is also stipulated that children aged seven to fifteen should generally not participate in night work. The Provincial Women's Federation has also instructed women's federations at all levels to do a good job in the care and education of women, children, and infants, ensuring that the labor force rests well.

    山西省委　省人民委员会做出决定
    保证劳动大军睡眠八小时
    本报讯　为了使劳动大军在三年苦战时间内长期保持旺盛的士气，有劳有逸地进行持续生产，中共山西省委和山西省人民委员会在本月5日发出关于保证劳动大军每天睡眠八小时的决定。
    这个决定指出：自去年冬季工农业生产全面大跃进，特别是今年9月大闹钢铁和突击秋收、种麦和深翻地以来，全省劳动人民共产主义觉悟和劳动积极性空前提高，男女老少，人人参加劳动，许多地方出勤的人，占到当地人口的80％到90％，人人干劲冲天，忘我地进行劳动，很少有人计较劳动时间、劳动定额、劳动报酬。这种共产主义精神和劳动态度，是十分宝贵的，是应该保持和发扬的。省委和省人民委员会为了使社会主义建设有节奏地进行，使人们的劳动有劳有逸，指示各级党的组织和人民政府，必须宝贵劳动大军苦战实干的劳动热情，十分注意劳动大军的休息问题，特别是劳动大军的睡眠问题。省委和省人民委员会认为：在一般的情况下，必须保证劳动大军每日有八小时的睡眠时间。决定中强调指出；保证劳动大军每日有八小时睡眠时间，不仅能保证进行持久生产，而且能使劳动人民体质日益增强，劳动效率日益提高，对于多快好省地建设成社会主义具有重要意义。
    决定中指出：保证劳动大军每日有八小时的睡眠时间，是一件关系千百万劳动人民生活和社会主义建设大事，各级党的组织和人民政府必须用最迅速的方法把这一决定传达到劳动大军的每一个基层组织，并且保证坚决执行。
    现在，全省各级党政领导机关正积极采取措施，贯彻执行这个决定。榆次、长治、晋南地委都决定，结合钢铁基地固定，修建简易房屋，进一步改善钢铁劳动大军的住宿、吃饭条件，保证处处有安静舒适的睡眠环境，人人都休息好。洪赵县委决定苦战夜战一般每月不超过七天，每月有三天政治、文化和社员个人活动时间。社员的正常生产时间一般应做到全月的三分之二。每个社每次组织社员进行突击性的生产活动，一般不超过两昼夜；在突击性的生产活动中，一般也要做到每天有六小时的睡眠时间。而在正常生产的情况下，一般睡眠时间要做到每天有八小时。还规定七至十五岁的少年儿童，一般不参加夜间劳动。省妇联也指示各级妇联组织做好妇幼婴儿托管和教养工作，保证劳动大军休息好。
