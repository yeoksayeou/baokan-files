    Donggang Ginseng Farm Runs University
    (Our dispatch) The Baishan Ginseng Industry University, founded by the Donggang State-owned Ginseng Farm in Fushong County, Jilin Province, is implementing Chairman Mao's "Constitution" for agricultural production in ginseng production. It guarantees that it will cultivate a group of red and expert ginseng technical personnel for the whole country within three years.
    Baishan Ginseng Industry University has five departments: Ginseng Industry, Industry, Animal Husbandry, Horticulture, and Machinery. It has local and foreign teachers, including ginseng farm technicians, technicians, veteran ginseng workers, graduate students from the Ginseng Cultivation Experimental Station of the Central Academy of Medical Sciences, and meteorological station technicians. The school currently has a total of 455 students.
    The teaching principle of this university is to combine theory with practice and to closely integrate teaching with production, determining the teaching content according to the production content. In July, the focus of ginseng production was on breaking up the ginseng soil (making the soil in the ginseng field fine), so the Ginseng Industry University lectured on soil science. After the teachers explained and analyzed from a theoretical perspective, the students conducted discussions and debates. Student Han Shouyue excitedly said: "I have been growing ginseng for more than ten years, and I only knew that old ginseng fields do not grow ginseng, but I didn't know why. Now I understand that it is because the soil has lost its fertility."
    During the learning process, theoretical knowledge was enriched, and production was also promoted. During the ginseng seed harvesting period, the university offered a ginseng seed course. After the students understood the characteristics of ginseng seeds, such as being rich in fat and unsuitable for exposure to the sun, they carried out seed drying operations under the guidance of teachers. They adopted the method of drying in the morning and evening and covering at noon, which resulted in good ginseng seed quality.
    In order to encourage students to actively conduct scientific research, the leadership has allocated 2,680 square meters of ginseng land to the school as a university experimental field. In the recent ginseng planting, teachers and students vigorously implemented Chairman Mao's "Constitution" for agricultural production, taking measures such as deep plowing, fertilization, and close planting, striving for high-yield ginseng production. In the past, ginseng planting only involved plowing five or six inches deep, and according to old habits, ginseng was planted lying down in the ground, and the soil was loosened with fingers. Teachers and students broke these habits, plowing more than two feet deep in the school fields, and simultaneously carried out layered fertilization. Some of the ginseng was changed to upright planting, and mechanical soil loosening was prepared for trial use. In the past, ginseng was planted with a spacing of more than five inches, but they changed it to a spacing of two inches, and carried out close planting experiments such as double plants and triple plants in one pit. Through these measures, the whole school plans to release high-yield "satellites" of 50 kilograms of ginseng per zhang (4.4 square meters) (this year's highest yield is 15 kilograms) and 1 kilogram of ginseng seeds per zhang (this year's highest is 436.1 grams).

    东岗参场办大学
    本报讯　吉林省抚松县东岗国营参场创办的白山参业大学，正在人参生产中贯彻毛主席的农业生产“宪法”。保证三年内为全国培养出一批又红又专的参业技术人材。
    白山参业大学设有参业、工业、畜牧、园艺、机械等五个系。拥有参场技工、技术员、参业老工人及中央医学科学院人参栽培试验站的研究生、气象站技术员等土洋教师。全校目前共有学生四百五十五名。
    这个大学的教学原则，是理论联系实际，教学和生产密切结合，按照生产内容确定教学内容。7月，人参生产的重点是打落参土（把参地的土打细），参业大学就讲授土壤课。教员从理论上讲解分析以后，再由学生进行座谈辩论，学生韩守月兴奋地说：“我种了十多年人参，只知道老参地不长参，却不知道是什么原因，这回明白了，是因为土壤失去了肥力。”
    在学习过程中，丰富了理论知识，也推动了生产。在收获参籽的时期，大学上了参籽课程。学生们懂得了参籽富有脂肪，不宜曝晒等特点以后，即在教师指导下，进行了晒籽操作。他们采取早晚晒、正午盖的办法，使参籽质量良好。
    领导上为了鼓励学生积极进行科学研究，已拨给学校二千六百八十公尺人参地作为大学的试验田。师生们在最近的栽参中，大力贯彻毛主席的农业生产“宪法”采取深翻、施肥、密植等措施，力争人参高额丰产。过去栽植人参只翻五、六寸深，并根据旧的习惯，把人参躺着栽在地里；用手指松土。师生们打破这些习惯，在校田里深翻二尺多，同时进行了分层施肥，一部分人参改为立栽，并准备试用机械松土。过去种人参株距五寸多，他们改为株距二寸，并进行了一埯双株、三株等密植试验。通过这些措施，全校计划放出丈（四点四平方公尺）产人参一百斤（今年的最高产量是三十斤）、人参籽二斤（今年最高是八两七钱二）的高产“卫星”。　（李树功）
