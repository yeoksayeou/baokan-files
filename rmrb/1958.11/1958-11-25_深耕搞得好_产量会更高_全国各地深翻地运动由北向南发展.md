Deep Plowing is Well Done, Yields Will Be Higher
National Deep Plowing Movement Develops from North to South

    This newspaper reports that the massive and magnificent deep plowing movement continues to develop. As of November 19, the national deep plowing area has risen to over 688.8 million mu, an increase of more than 330 million mu compared to mid-October. The vast majority of these cultivated lands have met the requirements for deep plowing, with 53.5% of the cultivated area plowed to a depth of 1.1 to 2 chi (Chinese feet, approx. 14.5 to 26 inches), 32% plowed to a depth of 7 cun (Chinese inches, approx. 9 inches) to 1 chi, and only a small amount plowed to less than 7 cun. Many areas have combined deep plowing with applying base fertilizer in layers and leveling the land.

    The deep plowing movement is developing from north to south. Several provinces in North China successively completed or basically completed their autumn plowing plans around mid-October. During the peak of the plowing season in Henan, Shandong, and Hebei provinces, more than 10 million people participated in autumn plowing every day, with daily progress exceeding 3 million mu. The plowing movement in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning fully unfolded after mid-October. By November 10, Jilin had completed 94% of its planned plowing. In early November, Heilongjiang, on the basis of having deeply plowed most of the province's arable land once, launched a movement to further deepen the high-yield fields, braving the cold winds to fight the frozen soil layers. Many areas in Liaoning Province are checking the quality while deep plowing. The Jinzhou area of Liaoning organized a large number of people to go deep into the fields to check the exaggerated practices in deep plowing. Through inspection, more than 63,000 hectares of land that did not meet the quality requirements were reworked in a timely manner.

    In provinces and regions such as Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang, in addition to areas that have completed or are nearing completion of their plowing plans, some areas are continuing autumn plowing and deep plowing in the severe cold. In early November, the autumn plowing movement in various parts of Inner Mongolia shifted to a climax of re-plowing and deep plowing. In Qinghai, a large professional plowing team of 200,000 people is racing against time with the freezing weather. According to statistics from seven counties in the province, including Xining, Minhe, and Ledu, 55% of the deep plowing task had been completed by November 4. In Dingxi and Gannan areas of Gansu, land is being plowed and fertilizer accumulated day and night. Dingxi area is striving to complete the task of deep plowing 10 million mu of land at a rate of 300,000 mu per day.

    Many areas where severe cold arrived earlier have adopted various methods adapted to local conditions to overcome the difficulties brought about by freezing in deep plowing. Some communes in Yushu, Panshi, Fuyu, and Huaide counties in Jilin Province have prepared tools such as large picks and plowing rammers for plowing frozen soil; Baicheng area uses explosives to blast and plow frozen land. Many production units in the Yikezhao League of Inner Mongolia use fire to thaw frozen soil and continue deep plowing.

    Southern provinces and regions are generally combining autumn harvesting and planting with deep plowing, and the movement is rapidly unfolding. By mid-November, Sichuan had completed 79.4% of its plan, and Hunan had completed 72.7%.

    In the process of autumn plowing, the leadership departments in various localities have firmly grasped the two key links of organizing labor and reforming tools. Various localities have organized specialized land cultivation corps while refining steel and autumn harvesting and planting. After achieving a decisive victory on the steel front, the Yuci area of Shanxi immediately mobilized a million-strong army, divided into five war zones, launched a thousand-regiment battle, and launched a surprise attack on plowing, achieving a huge result of plowing 200,000 mu of land on the first day. Shangqiu area of Henan, which has the fastest autumn plowing speed, promoted 100,000 rope-traction machines in deep plowing. The use of deep plowing plows for autumn plowing is now a very common phenomenon.

    深耕搞得好　产量会更高
    全国各地深翻地运动由北向南发展
    本报讯　声势浩大、规模壮阔的深翻地运动仍在继续发展中，截至11月19日，全国深耕面积已上升到六亿八千八百多万亩，比10月中旬增加了三亿三千多万亩。这些耕过的地绝大部分达到了深翻要求，耕深一尺一寸到二尺的占已耕面积的53.5％，耕深七寸到一尺的占32％，不足七寸的为数较少。不少地区都结合深耕，分层施了基肥和进行了平整。
    深翻运动正由北而南地发展着。华北地区的几省在10月中旬前后就相继完成了或基本完成今年秋翻计划。河南、山东、河北三省在翻地高潮时期，每天参加秋耕的有一千万人以上，每天的进度多在三百万亩以上。黑龙江、吉林、辽宁的翻地运动自10月中旬以后全面展开。吉林到11月10日已完成应翻计划的94％。黑龙江11月上旬在全省大部分耕地已经深翻了一遍的基础上，又掀起了大面积高产田进一步深翻的运动，冒着寒风再战冻结的地层。辽宁省许多地区在边深翻，边检查质量。辽宁锦州地区组织大批人员深入田间检查深翻中的虚夸作风。通过检查，有六万三千多垧不合质量要求的地及时返了工。
    内蒙古、青海、宁夏、新疆等省、区，除了已经完成或接近完成翻地计划的地区以外，部分地区也在严寒中继续秋耕和深翻。内蒙古各地秋耕运动在11月上旬转入复翻、深翻高潮。青海的二十万人组成的大批翻地专业队，在和冰冻抢时间。据这个省的西宁市、民和、乐都等七个县的统计，到11月4日已完成深翻任务55％。甘肃定西、甘南等地区，正在日夜不停地翻地积肥。定西地区以每天三十万亩的速度，力争完成深翻土地一千万亩的任务。
    许多严寒来临较早的地区，在深翻地中因地制宜地采取了各种方法克服冰冻带来的困难。吉林榆树、磐石、扶余、怀德等县的一些公社，为翻冻土准备了大镐、翻地夯等工具；白城地区采用炸药爆破翻冻地。内蒙古伊克昭盟不少生产单位用火熏开冻土继续深翻。
    南方各省区普遍结合秋收秋种进行深耕，运动正在迅速展开中。到11月中，四川已完成计划的79.4％，湖南已完成72.7％。
    在秋翻过程中，各地领导部门紧紧抓住了组织劳力和改革工具两大环节。各地在炼钢铁、秋收秋种的同时，组织了耕地专业兵团。山西榆次专区，在钢铁战线上取得决定性的胜利以后，立即调集了百万大军，分五个战区，发起千团大战，突击翻地，第一天就取得翻地二十万亩的巨大成绩。秋耕速度最快的河南商丘专区，在深耕中推广了十万部绳索牵引机。采用深耕犁秋翻已是十分普遍的现象。
