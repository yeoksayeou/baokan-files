Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 28th: Today, local newspapers published the answers given by Chivu Stoica, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, on November 24th, to questions from Moore Muddle, a reporter from the "Washington Post."

    Regarding Romania's economic relations, Chivu Stoica said that cooperation between Romania and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries had yielded rich results. The Romanian people consider it of particular importance to continue developing these relations.
    Chivu Stoica believes that it is entirely possible to establish relations with capitalist countries. However, it is not the socialist countries that are hindering the development of trade relations. He said: "The principles of peaceful coexistence should be followed, and the policies of the Cold War and creating international tension should be abandoned. This would allow trade relations to develop without hindrance."
    Chivu Stoica stated that Romania is willing to sign trade contracts with some American companies on mutually beneficial terms.
    Referring to the Romanian government's proposals for broad cooperation among Balkan countries, Chivu Stoica pointed out that these proposals remain on the agenda. If all countries have the sincerity and common desire to remove obstacles, this issue will surely achieve a satisfactory solution, which will benefit the people of all Balkan countries as well as peace in Europe and the world.
    Chivu Stoica also answered questions about relations between Romania and the United States. He pointed out that the Romanian government has repeatedly expressed its willingness to develop relations between Romania and the United States. However, regrettably, the American leadership is pursuing a policy of intensifying the international situation. This can be seen from the American attitude towards Romania and other socialist countries. However, the Romanian people will not be intimidated by this dangerous policy.
    In conclusion, Chivu Stoica said that the Romanian people will continue to work with other countries in the socialist camp, unswervingly implementing the policy of defending peace and developing international cooperation.

    基伏·斯托伊卡主席答美报记者问
    罗马尼亚坚持国际合作政策
    新华社布加勒斯特28日电　今天此间报纸发表了罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡24日答“华盛顿邮报”记者摩·姆德尔问。
    谈到罗马尼亚在经济关系方面的问题时，基伏·斯托伊卡说，罗马尼亚同苏联和其他社会主义国家之间的合作获得了丰富的成果。罗马尼亚人民认为继续发展这种关系有着特殊的重要意义。
    基伏·斯托伊卡认为，完全有可能同资本主义国家建立关系。但是，阻挠发展贸易关系的不是社会主义国家。他说：“应该遵循和平共处的原则，抛弃冷战和制造国际紧张局势的政策。这样就可以使贸易关系毫无阻碍地发展。”
    基伏·斯托伊卡表示罗马尼亚愿意在互利的条件下同美国的一些公司签订贸易合同。
    在谈到罗马尼亚政府关于实现巴尔干国家间的广泛合作的建议时，基伏·斯托伊卡指出，这些建议仍然是日程上的事。假如各国都有扫除障碍的诚意和共同愿望，这个问题必将会取得满意的解决，从而会给巴尔干地区各国人民以及欧洲和世界和平带来好处。
    基伏·斯托伊卡还回答了有关罗马尼亚和美国之间关系的问题。他指出，罗马尼亚政府曾屡次表示愿意发展罗美两国之间的关系。但是，很遗憾，美国领导集团却执行着使国际局势紧张化的政策。这可以从美国对罗马尼亚和其他社会主义国家的态度中看出来。但是，罗马尼亚人民不会被这种危险政策所吓倒。
    基伏·斯托伊卡最后说，罗马尼亚人民将继续同社会主义阵营其他国家一道，始终不渝地执行保卫和平和发展国际合作的政策。
