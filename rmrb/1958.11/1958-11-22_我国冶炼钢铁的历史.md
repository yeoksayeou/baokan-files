    The History of Iron and Steel Smelting in China
    Zhou Shide
    In the history of world metallurgy, China's iron and steel smelting technology was the earliest to achieve success and was extremely outstanding. In recent years, Chinese archaeologists have discovered the earliest ironware, dating back to the fifth century BC, but in small quantities. At the same time, they have also discovered ironware from the third and fourth centuries BC, not only in larger quantities but also with a considerable level of technical skill. Judging from the history of iron-making technology development in the world, this level could not have been achieved at the very beginning of iron smelting invention. Therefore, it can be inferred that the invention of Chinese iron smelting may have been in the Western Zhou Dynasty, or between the Western and Eastern Zhou Dynasties.
    By the Warring States period, iron smelting technology had developed considerably. In 1950, the excavation of Wei state tombs in Hui County, Henan Province, revealed more than ten kinds of iron production tools, totaling over ninety pieces, and eighty iron weapons. In 1953, six types of iron molds, totaling eighty-six pieces, were discovered in Rehe. From historical documents, it can also be seen that many wealthy people in the Warring States period became rich through iron smelting. Not only were there many types of ironware at that time, but the scale of manufacturing was also quite large, and techniques for converting pig iron to wrought iron and steel were invented. Iron swords as long as one hundred and forty centimeters appeared. By the Han Dynasty, the technique of converting pig iron to wrought iron had improved further, the use of iron weapons became more widespread, and iron tools were also forged from wrought iron. In particular, handcraft tools were almost entirely forged from wrought iron. According to historical records, there were thirty-four iron mountains in the Warring States period, distributed in the four provinces of Qin, Jin, Yu, and E. In the early Western Han Dynasty, the salt and iron industries were nationalized, and forty-nine iron officials were established, distributed in the provinces of Qin, Jin, Ji, Lu, Yu, Su, and Chuan. By the Eastern Han Dynasty, smelting industries had also developed slightly in the northwest, southwest, and northeast provinces. After the Tang Dynasty, iron production gradually increased in the south. By the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties, the ratio of iron production between the south and the north was three to one, or six to one. During the Han Dynasty, when the salt and iron industries were nationalized, there were more than 100,000 smelting workers. During the Jin Dynasty, there were 5,350 households in 39 smelting operations throughout the country. During the Liang Dynasty, tens of millions of catties of ironware stored in the eastern and western smelting sites were used to sink next to the Floating Mountain Weir during construction. It can be seen that the production of iron at that time was already not low. During the Sui Dynasty, smelting supervision was divided into three levels: large, medium, and small, and the number was certainly not small. By the Tang Dynasty, the annual iron production was more than 10 million catties, and there were 76 iron smelting pits at that time. During the Song Dynasty, the annual iron production was more than 30 million catties, and there were only 77 iron smelting pits. It can be seen that the productivity had already increased considerably. By the Yuan Dynasty, iron production decreased to more than 20 million catties. During the Ming Dynasty, it developed from an annual production of 30 million catties to an annual production of more than 90 million catties.
    In the early Qing Dynasty, mining was prohibited, but after the people's struggle, the rulers had to lift the ban. At this time, the scale of iron smelting plants became even larger. Each furnace produced 1,500 to 3,500 catties of iron per day, and at most, each furnace produced 6,000 catties of iron per day. In the past one hundred years, due to imperialist aggression, China's iron and steel industry stagnated. Before liberation, around 1932, the reactionary government sold 500,000 to 600,000 tons of iron sand to Japan every year, while China only used 200,000 to 300,000 tons of iron sand for its own use. At that time, iron factories in Daye Hanyang, Shanghai Pudong, Henan Xinxiang, and Hebei Shijingshan were frequently shut down. At that time, only the Yangzi and Yangquan iron factories in China were operating normally, with an annual output of less than 40,000 tons, and the annual import of more than 600,000 tons of various steels was still insufficient. The production tools and daily necessities used by the general working people were almost entirely maintained by the approximately 200,000 tons of iron produced annually by local methods. This is the general overview of the development of iron and steel production in China throughout the ages.
    The iron and steel smelting technology invented by our ancestors was not only the earliest in the world, but also the most advanced. Let us first talk about the air blowing equipment and fuel. In 31 AD, Du Shi created the water-powered bellows. The water-powered bellows is a water-powered blower used to blow air for iron smelting. In 215 AD, Han Ji promoted the water-powered bellows to the entire Wei Kingdom (Three Kingdoms period), and on a larger scale, utilizing larger rivers. Before 424 AD, our ancestors created artificial ponds, creating artificial water head to blow air for iron smelting. These are all technologies independently created by the Chinese people, writing a glorious page in the history of world metallurgy. The European hydraulic blast furnace was invented between the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and its widespread use in European countries was delayed until the fourteenth century. China invented it in the first century and widely promoted its use in the third century, about 1,100 years earlier than European countries.
    Secondly, multi-pipe air blowing. The "Mozi" records: one furnace uses four blowers. On the stone relief "Iron Smelting Picture" of the Eastern Han Dynasty, one furnace has more than four air supply pipes. During the Spring and Autumn Period, the Wu Kingdom used three hundred boys and girls to blow air and load charcoal to make the precious swords "Gan Jiang" and "Mo Ye". These all illustrate that our ancestors invented multi-pipe air blowing very early. In Europe, before the seventeenth century, the blast furnace had only one air supply pipe. Generally, two air sacs were used together with one air supply pipe to press air in. It was not until the eighteenth century that the air supply pipes on the blast furnace gradually increased from two to eight, and then sixteen. It can be said that we were nearly 2,000 years ahead of European countries in using multi-pipe air blowing smelting technology.
    Talking about iron-making fuel, coal was also first used in China. During the Wei and Jin Dynasties, the fuel used for iron smelting in China began to use coal. By the Song Dynasty, around the eleventh century AD, China's iron and steel industry had widely used coal as fuel. European countries did not use coal to smelt iron until the sixteenth century. In the thirteenth century, the Italian Marco Polo came to China and was surprised to see coal used as fuel. Both Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta recorded: "There is a kind of black stone in China that can be used as fuel, with great firepower and low price." When these foreigners discovered that we used coal as fuel to smelt iron, our ancestors had been using coal as fuel for nearly a thousand years.
    The creative achievements of our ancestors in iron and steel smelting technology can be seen in ancient and modern Chinese and foreign works. In the first century AD, Pliny wrote: "Although there are many types of iron, none can compare with the steel from China." Later, De John wrote in his book "Prehistoric Steel Use": "The Chinese knew before the era that pig iron and wrought iron could be put together to make steel, which is the precursor of the open-hearth steelmaking method."
    In ancient Chinese books, there are also records of the creative inventions of our ancestors in steelmaking technology. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Tao Hongjing of the Liang Dynasty said that steel is made by mixing pig iron and wrought iron for smelting. During the Northern Qi Dynasty, Qi Mu Huaiwen created the Subduing Iron Knife. Subduing iron is filling steel, which is to melt pig iron and pour it into wrought iron raw materials to make steel. By the Song Dynasty, this kind of filling steel was popular throughout China. This steelmaking technology further developed, and then produced the later "Su Steel." It is said that Su Steel was created by workers in Jiangsu. Small steel plants in various southwestern provinces in modern times still use this smelting method. Mr. Zhou Zhihong has conducted detailed investigations and profound analyses, and believes that: "This steelmaking method is different from the early steelmaking methods of advanced industrial countries in the world. They have all the methods of wrought iron carburized steel in the past; however, there is no similar discovery of this steelmaking method in foreign countries. It is obviously a creative invention." The invention of filling steel, initially recorded as early as the Northern and Southern Dynasties, is about 1,500 years ago. The invention of European steelmaking technology is only more than 200 years ago, more than 1,200 years earlier than European countries.
    The most famous of ancient Chinese steel products, knives and swords, are the "Gan Jiang" and "Mo Ye" of the Spring and Autumn Period. Others such as "Zhan Lu," "Ju Que," "Yu Chang," "Long Yuan," "Tai A," and "Gong Bu" are all famous swords in history. From the Warring States to the Wei, Jin, Northern and Southern Dynasties, many famous knife and sword smelters appeared. They often used a bunch of hanging rice awns to test whether the knives and swords were sharp. During the Jin Dynasty, Liu Kun's sword could break thirteen "awns" but not the hair; Huang Wenqing's sword during the Liang Dynasty could break fifteen "awns"; Qi Mu Huaiwen's Subduing Iron Knife during the Northern Qi Dynasty could cut through more than thirty armor pieces; Cao Wei made Bai Pi knives several times; Pu Yuan of Western Shu made 3,000 knives called Divine Knives. These precious knives and swords generally have tortoiseshell patterns (such as "Gan Jiang") or water ripple patterns (such as "Mo Ye"), and the Damascus steel knives of East Asian countries such as Japan and Central and South Asian countries such as Persia and India, are all of the same type as wootz steel. These precious knives and swords are not only well-known in China, but also have been regarded as treasures by European countries. However, Europeans did not discover its secret for a long time and could not make such knives and swords. They only used acids to etch patterns on ordinary knives and swords to pretend. It was not until 1837 that the outstanding Russian engineer Anosov discovered this scientific secret and gave it a high evaluation.
    Heat treatment and machining. One type of machining is hot working. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Ji Kang and Xiang Xiu, two of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, liked to forge. During the Song Dynasty, Shen Kuo made careful observations and records of forging steel. At the same time, he also had a clear understanding of cold working (cold forging). During the Ming Dynasty, Song Yingxing described the method of making needles. As early as three hundred years ago, our ancestors cleverly used pig iron as dies to invent cold drawing. Regarding quenching, since the Warring States period, quenching methods have also sought different hardnesses through differences in cooling methods. But the main aspect is not the difference in water temperature, but the different fluids used. They paid attention to the composition of water, knowing which kinds of water can be used and which kinds of water cannot be used. Dragon Spring Sword is named after being quenched with Dragon Spring water. The Cao Wei Bai Pi sword was quenched with clear Zhang water; Pu Yuan believed that Han River water and Fu River water could not be used, and Chengdu water must be used; Qi Mu Huaiwen of the Northern Qi Dynasty used oil quenching (the fat of five kinds of livestock) and also urine quenching (the urine of five kinds of livestock). Quenching technology was further developed in the Ming Dynasty. After quenching in water several times, they applied tiger bone potassium nitrate sauce, burned it red, and then quenched it again, or used sheep horn milk hair powder to apply. These all illustrate that people at this time had a deep understanding of heat treatment. In the process of making needles in the Ming Dynasty, it included two heat treatment steps. One is surface carburizing treatment using pine wood, fire arrows, and fermented soybeans as carburizing agents, and the other is the "fast water and fire method." In addition, in terms of heat treatment, the most important contribution of the Chinese people is the "pig iron surface coating method." This method is a unique and original heat treatment technology of the Chinese people. Mr. Li Hengde believes that although carburizing treatment of soft iron has long been used in Europe, the carburizing agents used by Europeans are all solid, while the Chinese use molten pig iron as a carburizing agent, which can save hundreds or thousands of times the time. The method is that the original product does not need to be melted, but molten pig iron is used to coat it to increase the carbon content and hardness of the surface layer. This method not only utilizes the principle of steelmaking, but also maintains the operation of heat treatment, which is easier than many modern heat treatments. These technologies are also worth studying and utilizing by our metallurgical workers today.
    Speaking of cast iron, our ancestors invented cast iron technology two thousand years ago. The invention of European cast iron technology is only nine hundred years ago. We are more than a thousand years earlier than European countries. The famous British scholar Joseph Needham believes that European cast iron technology was introduced from China between the eleventh and twelfth centuries. China's cast iron technology had reached a very high level of development during the Han and Tang Dynasties, especially during the Song Dynasty. Li Zengbo was able to cast 2,000 iron cannons per month in Jingzhou. By the Ming Dynasty, iron bells weighing 10,000 catties could be cast. When casting, ten to twenty tons of iron were melted at a time, and the weight of the castings was five tons or more than ten tons. Moreover, the Chinese at that time had already mastered what Europeans and Americans today call the "lost-wax casting method." This method is still a high-level skill today.
    Regarding the production process of steel, Mr. Li Hengde has analyzed the iron-making method recorded by Song Yingxing in the Ming Dynasty. He believes that there are several characteristics that cannot be ignored. The first is the series use of iron-making furnaces and pig iron to wrought iron furnaces. The molten iron flowing from the iron-making furnace flows directly into the pig iron to wrought iron furnace to make wrought iron. This method is not seen in 17th century Europe. The use of this method reduces the process of re-melting, which is an important feature of modern metallurgical technology. To some extent, the Chinese have long mastered this kind of economical production technology. The second is the semi-continuous nature of the iron-making furnace operation. After the iron is tapped, the tapping hole is blocked with mud and the air is blown again for smelting, unlike early European furnaces, which had to wait for the furnace to cool down before the iron could be taken out. Third, iron ore is smelted into pig iron, then pig iron is smelted into wrought iron, and then pig iron and wrought iron are combined to make steel. This is the steel production system that is being promoted worldwide today.
    As mentioned above, in terms of iron and steel smelting technology, China invented it earlier than European countries in many aspects, and it is very original and unique. Many high-level iron and steel smelting skills were mastered by our ancestors thousands of years ago, or hundreds of years ago. It is only in the past hundred years that due to the aggression of foreign imperialism and the cruel rule of the domestic reactionary government, China has fallen behind the advanced countries in the world in terms of iron and steel smelting. Since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the selfless labor of the people of the whole country, China's iron and steel smelting industry has developed rapidly. In just a few years since liberation, we have done things that our predecessors have not done in decades, hundreds of years, or even thousands of years. At present, China is using steel as the key link and carrying out a large-scale national steelmaking movement. It can be expected that in a few years, we will quickly catch up with the world level in the steel industry and stand in the ranks of industrially advanced countries.

    我国冶炼钢铁的历史
    周世德
    在世界冶金史上，中国的钢铁冶炼技术，成就最早，而且极其出色。近几年来，我国考古工作者，已发现的最早的铁器，是公元前五世纪的，但数量不多；同时又发现了公元前三、四世纪的铁器，不仅数量较多，而且已经有了相当的技术水平。从世界冶铁技术发展的历史来看，这种水平决不是刚发明冶铁时就能达到的。因此，可以推断，中国冶铁术的发明，可能在西周时代，或西周和东周之间。
    到战国时代，冶铁术就更有了长足的发展。1950年河南辉县发掘魏国墓葬，发现铁制生产工具十几种九十多件，铁制兵器八十件；1953年在热河发现战国时代铁范六种八十六件。从历史文献上也可看到，战国时代各国富豪很多是冶铁致富的。那时的铁器不仅种类多，而且制造业的规模也相当大，并发明了生铁炒炼熟铁和炼钢的技术，出现了长达一百四十公分的铁剑。到了汉代，炒炼熟铁的技术更加提高，铁兵器的应用更加普遍，铁工具也有用熟铁锻制的；特别是手工业工具，几乎全用熟铁锻制了。据文献记载，战国时代，铁山三十四处，分布在秦晋豫鄂四省。西汉初年，盐铁国有，设铁官四十九处，分布在秦、晋、冀、鲁、豫、苏、川等省。到东汉时，西北、西南、东北各省，冶炼事业也略有发展。唐代以后，南方产铁渐多。到宋、元、明三代，南方与北方铁产量的比数为三与一之比，或六与一之比。汉代盐铁国有，冶炼工人在十万以上。晋时全国三十九冶五千三百五十户。梁时修筑浮山堰曾用东西两冶场所存铁器几千万斤沉在堰旁。可见，当时铁的生产量已经不低。隋代冶监分为大中小三等，数量当然不会太少。到了唐代，每年产铁一千多万斤，那时有铁冶坑数七十六。宋代年产铁三千万斤以上，铁冶坑数也只有七十七。可见生产率也已经相当提高了。到了元代，铁产量减少到两千多万斤。明代又从年产三千万斤发展到年产九千万斤以上。
    清初禁矿，但经过人民斗争，统治者也不得不开禁，这时炼铁厂的规模也更加大了。每炉每天产生铁一千五百斤到三千五百斤，最多时每炉每天产生铁六千斤。近一百多年以来，由于帝国主义的侵略，使我国钢铁工业停滞不前。解放前，在1932年前后，反动政府每年售给日本铁砂五六十万吨，我国自用的铁砂不过二三十万吨。当时大冶汉阳，上海浦东，河南新乡，河北石景山各铁厂经常停工，那时，我国铁厂正常开工的仅扬子、阳泉二厂，年产不足四万吨，每年进口各种钢材六十余万吨尚不足用。一般劳动人民所用的生产工具和生活用具，几乎全靠各地土法冶炼的、年产二十万吨左右的土铁维持。这就是我国历代钢铁生产发展的概况。
    我们祖先发明冶炼钢铁的技术，不仅是世界上最早的，也是最先进的。我们先从鼓风设备和燃料谈起。公元31年，杜诗创造了水排。水排就是水力鼓风机用来鼓风炼铁。公元215年，韩暨把水排推广到整个魏国（三国时代），而且规模较大，利用了较大的河流。公元424年前，我们的祖先又创造了人工水塘，造成人为的水流落差，用来鼓风炼铁。这些都是中国人独立创造的技术，在世界冶金史上写下了光辉的一页。欧洲水力鼓风炉，是在十一、二世纪之间才发明的，欧洲各国的普遍使用，要迟到十四世纪。而我国则是在一世纪发明的，三世纪普遍推广使用，比欧洲各国要早一千一百年左右。
    其次，多管鼓风。“墨子”上记载：一个炉用四个鼓风器。东汉的石浮雕“冶铁图”上，一个炉有四个以上的送风管。春秋时吴国造宝剑“干将”、“莫邪”，用男女童三百人鼓风装炭。这些都说明了我们祖先很早就发明了多管鼓风。在欧洲，十七世纪以前，鼓风炉的送风管只有一个，一般炉子都是用二个风囊合用一根送风管把空气压送进去。到十八世纪，鼓风炉上的送风管才由二个陆续增加到八个，十六个。可以说，使用多管鼓风的冶炼技术，我们比欧洲国家早了将近二千年。
    谈到炼铁燃料，石炭也是我国首先应用的。魏晋时代，我国冶铁所用的燃料已开始应用石炭。到了宋代，在公元十一世纪前后，我国冶铁业已广泛地应用石炭作为燃料。欧洲各国，要迟到十六世纪才用石炭冶铁。十三世纪时，意大利人马哥波罗来到中国，看到用石炭作燃料，非常惊奇。马哥波罗和伊本拔秃塔都曾记述了：“中国有一种黑石头可以作燃料，火力大，价格还便宜，”当这些外国人发现我们用石炭作燃料炼铁时，我们祖先用石炭作燃料已将近一千年了。
    我们祖先在钢铁冶炼技术方面创造性的成就，在中外古今的著作中都可看到，公元一世纪时普利尼曾写道：“虽然铁的种类多了又多，但没有一种能和从中国来的钢比美的。”后来德约翰在他的“史前钢铁使用”一书中写道：“中国人在纪元以前已经知道把生铁和熟铁放在一起炼出钢来，正是后世平炉炼钢方法的先声。”
    在我国古籍里，还记载着我们祖先在炼钢技术方面的创造发明。南北朝时代，梁陶宏景说，钢是把生铁和熟铁混杂起来冶炼的。北齐綦母怀文曾造宿铁刀。宿铁就是灌钢，它是把生铁熔化灌注到熟铁原料中而成钢。到了宋代，这种灌钢已在全中国流行。这种炼钢技术进一步发展，就产生了后来的“苏钢”。据说，苏钢是江苏的工人创造的。近代西南各省小型钢厂，还有采用这种冶炼方法的。周志宏先生曾经作了详细的调查和深刻的分析，认为：“这种炼钢方法和世界工业先进国家早期的炼钢方法不同。他们过去所有熟铁渗炭钢等方法，我们都有；可是我们这种炼钢方法，在国外还没有类似的发现，显然是一种创造性的发明。”灌钢的发明，最初见于记载的如从南北朝时代算起，距今已一千五百年左右。欧洲炼钢术的发明距今只二百多年，我们比欧洲国家早了一千二百多年。
    我国古代钢的制成品刀剑，最有名的要算春秋时代“干将”“莫邪”了，其他如“湛卢”、“巨阙”、“鱼肠”、“龙渊”、“太阿”、“工布”等等，都是历史上有名的宝剑。从战国到魏晋南北朝，出了不少有名的刀剑冶炼家，他们常常以发悬挂稻芒一束来验刀剑是否锋利。晋时刘?的剑能断十三根“芒”而发不断；梁时黄文庆的剑能断十五根“芒”；北齐綦母怀文的宿铁刀能斩甲过三十札；曹魏几次制造百辟刀；西蜀蒲元造刀三千口称为神刀。这种宝刀宝剑一般都有龟裂纹（如“干将”）或水波纹（如“莫邪”），和东亚国家日本以及中南亚国家波斯、印度等国的镔铁刀，都和布拉特钢是一种类型。这种宝刀宝剑不仅在中国脍炙人口，而且欧洲各国都一直把它认为宝贝。但欧洲人长期没有发现它的秘密，造不出这样的刀剑，只是用酸类在寻常刀剑上侵蚀出花纹来冒充，直到1837年，俄罗斯杰出工程师安诺索夫才发现了这个科学秘密，给了它很高的评价。
    热处理和机械加工。机械加工的一种是热作。南北朝时，竹林七贤中的稽康、向秀好锻。宋时沈括，对于锻钢就有了仔细的观察和记录，同时他对冷作（冷锻）也有明确的认识。明代宋应星叙述了造针的方法。早在三百年前，我们的祖先已聪明地利用生铁作镆发明冷拉了。关于淬火，从战国以来淬法也是由冷却方法的差别求得不同的硬度。但主要的方面不在于水的温度的差异，而在于所用的流质不同。他们注意到水的成份，知道了某几种水能用，某几种水不能用。龙泉剑就是用龙泉水淬火而得名。曹魏百辟剑用清漳水淬火；蒲元造刀认为汉江水涪江水都不能用，一定要成都的水才行；北齐綦母怀文用油淬（五牲之脂）也用尿淬（五牲之溺）。淬火技术到了明代，又有了进一步的发展，他们在水中淬了几次以后，涂上虎骨朴硝酱烧红再淬，或用羊角乳发末调敷。这都说明了这时人们对于热处理已经有了深刻的研究。在明代造针的过程中包括了两种热处理的步骤，一种是用松木、火矢、豆豉作渗炭剂的表层增炭处理，另一种是“水火徤法”。此外，在热处理方面，中国人最重要的贡献是“生铁淋口法”。这种方法是中国人独创独到的热处理技术。李恒德先生认为：用柔铁加以渗炭处理在欧洲固然久已使用，但欧洲人用的渗炭剂都是固体的，而中国人却利用了熔化的生铁作渗炭剂，可以省却千百倍的时间。作法是，原来的制作品不需要熔化，却用熔化的生铁淋在上面来加高表层的炭份和硬度。这个办法既利用了炼钢的原理，又保持热处理的操作，比起现代的许多热处理都要轻易。这些技术，在今天也是值得我们冶金工作者研究和利用的。
    谈到铸铁，我们的祖先在二千年前已经发明了铸铁术。而欧洲铸铁术的发明距今只九百年。我们比欧洲各国要早一千多年。英国有名的学者李约瑟先生认为，欧洲铸铁术是在十一十二世纪之间由中国传入的。我国铸铁术到汉、唐两代，特别是到了宋代，已经有了很高的发展。李曾伯在荆州每月能铸铁炮二千只。到了明代，能铸万斤的铁钟。铸时一次熔铁十吨到二十吨，铸件的重量在五吨或十吨以上。而且当时中国人早已掌握了今日欧美人所谓“蜡铸法”。这种方法在今天也还是一种高度的技巧。
    在钢铁的生产程序上，李恒德先生曾分析了明代宋应星所记的炼铁方法。他认为有几个特色不容忽视。第一是炼铁炉和炒铁炉的串联使用，从炼铁炉流出的铁水直接流进炒铁炉炒成熟铁。这方式不见于十七世纪的欧洲。这个方法的使用，减少了一步再熔化的过程，是现代冶金技术上一个重要的特色。在某种程度上讲，中国人早已掌握了这一种经济的生产技术。第二是炼铁炉操作的半连续性，出铁后用泥堵了出铁口，鼓风再炼，不像欧洲早期要等炉冷后才能把铁取出来。第三，把铁矿炼成生铁，再由生铁炼成熟铁，然后由生铁熟铁合炼成钢，这正是今日推行在全世界的钢铁生产系统。
    如上所述，在钢铁冶炼技术方面，我国在很多方面比欧洲国家发明得早，而且很有独创独到的地方。有许多冶炼钢铁的高度技巧，几千年前，或几百年前就为我们的祖先所掌握了。只是近百年来，由于外国帝国主义的侵略，和本国反动政府的残酷统治，我国在冶炼钢铁方面，才落后于世界先进的国家。解放以来，由于共产党的正确领导和全国人民忘我劳动，我国冶炼钢铁的事业才飞跃地向前发展。在解放几年的时间里，我们做了前人几十年几百年甚至几千年没有做到的事情。目前，我国正在以钢为纲，开展着一个规模壮阔的全民炼钢运动，可以预期，几年以后，我们在钢铁事业上，将很快赶上世界水平，站在工业先进国的行列里。
