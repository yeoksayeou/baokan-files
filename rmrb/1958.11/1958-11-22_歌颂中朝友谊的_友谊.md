The drama "Friendship," performed by the Literary and Art Troupe of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Political Department, tells the story of a reconnaissance platoon of our Volunteer Army rescuing a Korean woman whose family was destroyed by the American aggressors. She was a pregnant woman who was also seriously injured. After great efforts by our medical personnel and soldiers, she was finally saved, gave birth to a boy, and recovered her health. The reconnaissance platoon leader was captured while on a mission, and she returned home, risking everything with her older child to rescue the platoon leader. This play is based on true events: that Korean woman (named Jin Shunyu in the play), after designing the rescue of the reconnaissance member, was surrounded by enemy soldiers. She bit open a grenade she was carrying and died with the enemy, sacrificing heroically. In the play, however, it is said that she was seriously injured but returned victorious.

The beauty of this play lies in its depiction of high humanism, patriotism, and internationalism through human relationships. Presented to us are real and vivid events, done by lively and ordinary people. They work tirelessly, risking their lives, not for any reward, but only for the interests of the Party and the country, and the common aspirations of the people – a society without exploitation and lasting world peace. When Jin Shunyu was rescued and about to have her child, the soldiers of the reconnaissance platoon were concerned about the safety of the mother and child. The platoon leader used his own shirt to sew a piece of clothing for the baby, waiting for the newborn. However, Jin Shunyu's childbirth after being injured was critical. Medical personnel and soldiers gave her blood transfusions and managed to save her with great difficulty. She had a child, and mother and child were safe. I want to ask: in what era, in what place, has there ever been such a good and lovely army? This is the army of our people today, under the leadership of the Party!

The reconnaissance platoon leader was seriously injured while performing a mission and unintentionally arrived at Jin Shunyu's mother-in-law's newly moved house. Jin Shunyu's older child followed his grandmother, and they immediately hid the injured platoon leader. Unfortunately, they were discovered by the enemy. The platoon leader and the old woman were arrested together, and the old woman and child both behaved very heroically.

Jin Shunyu, seeing that the platoon leader had not returned, stepped forward despite her illness to inquire about his whereabouts. She found her mother-in-law's new house and met her older child. She then took this child as cover to work together. The last scene of the play shows her full of courage and wisdom. For the sake of her motherland, for the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, she displayed the fearless spirit and lofty integrity of the Korean people. Some comrades believe that it would be better to truthfully depict her heroic sacrifice here, and I agree. No one wants a hero like Jin Shunyu to be sacrificed. Her victorious return may be in line with the audience's wishes. However, she penetrated the enemy's lair, rescued the platoon leader, and covered his escape. Surrounded by the enemy, she perished with them, allowing the platoon leader to escape calmly. Since there is such a heroic example, truthfully presenting it to the audience would be even more inspiring. I don't know if this thinking is correct.

Such events are just one of thousands of examples between the Chinese and Korean people, and the heroic deeds of the Korean people are endless. Just looking at this play, it can help us understand how the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people was built, how it developed, and how it became unbreakable. The Chinese and Korean people fought side by side, defeated American imperialism, and achieved a great victory, safeguarding the common ideals, common cause, and common security of the two peoples, and ensuring peace in Asia. It encouraged the determination and courage of colonial and semi-colonial countries to strive for independence and freedom. Such a great historical achievement, I don't know how many plays can be written about it, but the artistic forms of expression are too few; or they are expressed too generally and not deeply enough; so the play "Friendship" is very valuable. I was very happy to see the play, and I express my respect to the author and performers.

    歌颂中朝友谊的“友谊”
    欧阳予倩
    中国人民志愿军政治部文艺工作团演出了话剧“友谊”，写的是我志愿军某部侦察排救了一个被美国侵略军迫害得家破人亡的朝鲜妇女；她是个孕妇又受了重伤，经我医务人员和战士们大力抢救，终于把她救活了，生下来一个男孩，她也恢复了健康。侦察排的排长在执行任务中受伤被俘，她回家带着她的大孩子冒了绝大的危险设法把排长救了出来。这个戏是有真人真事的根据的：那个朝鲜妇女（戏里叫金顺玉）在设计救出侦察员之后，被敌兵包围，她咬开身边带的手榴弹，与敌人同归于尽，壮烈牺牲了。在戏里却是说她受了重伤胜利归来。
    这个戏的好处就是通过人与人的关系，表现出高度的人道主义、爱国主义和国际主义精神。呈现在我们面前的是真实生动的事，做这些事的是生动活泼的人；而这些人都是平凡的普通的人。他们不辞辛苦，拼着性命，不为什么报酬，只为党和国家的利益，人民共同的美好愿望——一个没有剥削的社会，世界的持久和平。当金顺玉被救回来快养孩子的时候，侦察排的战士们都为这母子的安全耽着心事，排长用自己的衬衫缝了一件小孩衣服，等待着新生的婴儿。可是金顺玉伤后临盆，情势危急，医务人员和战士为她输血，好容易把她挽救过来，养了个孩子，大小平安。我要问：什么时代，在什么地方，曾经有过这样好、这样可爱的军队？这是在今天在党的领导之下，我们人民的军队！
    侦察排长执行任务受了重伤，无意中到了金顺玉婆婆新搬的家，金顺玉的大孩子跟着他祖母，他们马上把那受伤的排长藏起来，不幸被敌人发现了，排长同那个老大娘一同被捕，老人和孩子都表现得非常英勇。
    金顺玉见排长一去不回，带病挺身而出，去打听排长的下落，找到了她婆婆新搬的家，遇到了自己的大孩子，她便带着这孩子为掩护一同工作。戏的最后一场，显出她浑身是胆，智慧过人，她为了自己的祖国，为了中朝人民的友谊，发挥了朝鲜人民大无畏的精神和崇高的志节。有的同志认为这里还是如实的表现她壮烈牺牲比较好，我也有此同感。像金顺玉这样的英雄，无论谁也不愿意她遭到牺牲，作为她胜利归来，可能是符合观众的愿望。可是她当时那样深入虎穴，把排长营救出来，并掩护他逃走，受着敌人的包围，她便与敌人同归于尽，使排长得从容出险。既有这样的英雄实例，把她如实的表现在观众面前，当更足以激发人心。不知道这样想对不对。
    像这样的事情在中朝人民之间，只是千万个例子当中的一个，而朝鲜人民的英雄事迹也是说不完道不完的。单就这个戏看，也可以帮助我们理解中朝人民的友谊是怎样建成，怎样发展，怎样成为牢不可破的。中国人民和朝鲜人民并肩作战，打败了美帝国主义，取得了伟大的胜利，维护了两国人民共同的理想、共同的事业和共同的安全，并保障了亚洲的和平。鼓舞了殖民地和半殖民地国家争取独立自由的决心和勇气。这样伟大的历史业绩，不知道能编出多少本戏来，可是用艺术形式来表达的实在太少；或者就表现得过于一般而不够深刻；所以“友谊”这个戏十分可贵。看了戏很高兴，以此对作者、演者表示敬意。
