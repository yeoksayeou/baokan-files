Working and Living with Communist Spirit
Soviet People Enthusiastically Launch Labor Emulation Drive
Competitors Propose to Strive for Production and Learning and Play an Exemplary Communist Role in Life

(People's Daily, Moscow, November 25th dispatch) In the Soviet Union, as the people across the country are enthusiastically discussing the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan, a significant and magnificent communist labor emulation movement has taken shape and is expanding day by day. This labor emulation movement has distinct characteristics, permeated with the spirit of striving for communism. The slogan of the movement is: Work and live with the spirit of communism. The workers and peasants participating in the competition propose not only to complete production tasks well but also to actively propose rationalization suggestions, strive to improve their cultural and technical levels, and play an exemplary communist role in life. Winners of the competition will be awarded the title of "Communist Labor Team."

This communist labor emulation movement was born at the Moscow marshalling yard, where the first voluntary labor Saturday began forty years ago. Forty years ago, Lenin participated in voluntary labor here and wrote his famous work "A Great Beginning." When discussing the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan, the workers at this marshalling yard paid special attention to this sentence in the document: The Soviet Union has entered the period of building a communist society. The Communist Youth League members of the ball bearing workshop at the marshalling yard first proposed the initiative to launch a communist competition. This initiative quickly received a response from all workers and drivers at the marshalling yard. Now, not only the workers in each workshop are participating in the competition, but also the crew of each locomotive. Driver Shmaev of locomotive 20-70 said that all comrades in our locomotive crew want to contribute more to communist construction. Now we not only guarantee to complete the task excellently but also propose to participate in voluntary labor for housing construction, master the operation technology of electric locomotives, and fight against all backward phenomena in life. After the communist competition initiative of the Moscow marshalling yard was published in the newspaper, it was quickly echoed throughout the Soviet Union. The "Red Vyborger" factory in Leningrad was one of the first to respond to the launch of the communist competition movement. The socialist labor emulation was first launched in this factory twenty-nine years ago, and now when the workers of this factory heard the initiative of the workers of the Moscow marshalling yard, they immediately stood up to respond. A team of workers from the rolling mill, led by Voronin, decided to master the production technology of new steel materials ahead of schedule, propose at least one rationalization suggestion per person before April next year, master a second technology in addition to their basic business, and teach young apprentices well. The old workers of this factory suggested challenging the Kirov factory, the Moscow "Sickle and Hammer" factory, and other factories that competed in 1929 to contribute to communism together.

The "Sickle and Hammer" factory did not lag behind and immediately accepted the conditions of the challenge, and each workshop formulated its own battle plan. The youth work team of the steel plate rolling workshop, led by Chuzhev, in addition to agreeing to the challenge conditions, specifically proposed that the six-hour work per shift be completed in five hours, and the last hour be used to produce surplus products, and guarantee that 95% of these surplus products are first-class steel.

The Kushko work team of the Dzerzhinsky Collective Farm in Ovidiopol district, Odessa Oblast, launched a competition with the Mamai advanced work team in Donbas. This summer, the Kushko work team produced one hundred and fifty-six poods of grain per hectare of land. To welcome the Twenty-first Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the members of this work team proposed to strive for a yield of one hundred and sixty-five poods per hectare next year and to undertake all the planting and harvesting work of corn in the farm.

This communist labor emulation movement is currently continuing to develop in depth throughout the Soviet Union.

    用共产主义精神来工作和生活
    苏联人民热烈展开劳动竞赛
    竞赛者提出要努力生产和学习在生活中起共产主义模范作用
    本报莫斯科25日电　在苏联，当全国人民正在热烈讨论七年计划控制数字的时候，一个意义重大、波澜壮阔的共产主义劳动竞赛运动已经形成，并且在日益扩大。这个劳动竞赛运动有着鲜明的特点，它贯穿着为共产主义奋斗的精神。运动的口号是：用共产主义的精神来工作和生活。参加竞赛的工人和农民提出，不但要把生产任务完成得很好，并且要积极提出合理化建议，努力提高自己的文化和技术水平，在生活中起共产主义的模范作用。竞赛得胜者将获得“共产主义劳动队”的称号。
    这个共产主义劳动竞赛运动，是诞生在四十年前开始第一个义务劳动星期六的莫斯科调车站。四十年前，列宁在这里参加了义务劳动并且写出了他的名著“伟大的创举”。这个调车站的工人在讨论七年计划控制数字时，特别注意到文件中的这一句话：苏联已经进入了开展共产主义社会建设的时期。调车站滚珠车间的共青团员们首先提出了开展共产主义竞赛的倡议。这个倡议迅速得到调车站全体工人和司机的响应。现在参加竞赛的不但有各车间工人，并且有各个机车的乘务组。20—70号机车上的司机施马?夫说，我们机车组的全体同志都想为共产主义建设多尽一份力量。现在我们不但保证优秀地完成任务，并且提出要参加住宅建设的义务劳动，掌握电气车头操纵技术，在生活中与一切落后现象作斗争等保证。莫斯科调车站的共产主义竞赛倡议在报上发表以后，苏联全国各地都纷纷响应。列宁格勒“红色维堡人”工厂是首先响应开展共产主义竞赛运动的一个。社会主义劳动竞赛是二十九年前首先在这个工厂里展开的，现在当这个工厂的工人听到莫斯科调车站工人的倡议以后，马上起来响应。轧钢车间瓦罗宁的一个工作队，决定提早掌握新钢材的生产技术，在明年4月前，每人至少提出一件合理化建议，除去自己的基本业务以外再掌握一种技术，并且教好青年学徒。这个工厂的老工人建议与1929年竞赛过的工厂基洛夫工厂、莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”工厂等挑战，一同为共产主义贡献力量。
    “镰刀与锤子”工厂也不落后，立即接受挑战的条件，各车间都制定了自己的应战计划。钢板压轧车间丘日夫青年工作队除去同意挑战条件外，更具体提出每班六小时的工作用五小时完成，最后一小时生产超额产品，并且保证这种超额产品的95％是一级钢材。
    敖德萨州奥维季欧波尔区捷尔任斯基集体农庄库什科工作队同顿巴斯的马麦依先进工作队展开了竞赛。库什科工作队今年夏季在每公顷土地上生产了一百五十六普特粮食，为了迎接苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会，这个工作队的成员提出了明年争取每公顷的产量达到一百六十五普特，并且担任下农庄玉米的全部播种和收获工作。
    这个共产主义劳动竞赛运动，目前在苏联全国各地还在继续深入展开中。
