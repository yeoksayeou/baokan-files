Editorial Note: A larger-scale winter water conservancy construction upsurge is about to arrive. During the large-scale water conservancy construction movement, various regions need a large number of building materials. How to solve the materials problem? Is it to wait for allocation from higher authorities, or to rely on the masses to manufacture and solve the problem locally? This is a major issue and a divergence of two lines in practical work. Today, this newspaper publishes news from the Shangyou Reservoir in Linchuan County, Jiangxi, about running its own factories and manufacturing its own equipment, ensuring the normal progress of the project, which provides a good experience for solving this problem and is worthy of attention in various regions.

Nanchang Electric Report from this newspaper: What to do when there is a lack of equipment for water conservancy construction this year? After debate, the Shangyou Reservoir construction site in Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province, mobilized the masses to run on-site factories using local methods, and to produce various equipment through self-reliance. This not only ensured the normal construction and necessary quality of the project, but also saved a lot of investment.

Now, the practice of Shangyou Reservoir of running on-site factories on a large scale has been widely promoted on various water conservancy construction sites in Linchuan County, playing a significant role in promoting the rapid development of the current water conservancy construction movement.

The Shangyou Reservoir is one of the larger-scale water conservancy projects planned to be built this year in Linchuan County with commune-run and government assistance. The benefited area spans more than 100,000 mu of land in seven communes. According to the design, the dam, the 100-li long main canal, and various buildings on several branch canals require more than 300 tons of cement and 24 tons of steel. At the same time, since the main canal has to pass through nineteen large mountains, the stone works also require more than ten tons of explosives and a large number of detonators. But the difficulty encountered was: the amount of these equipment and materials supplied by the state this year is limited, even if larger projects are taken care of, the amount of cement allocated is only 15% of the plan, steel is only 30% of the plan, and other explosives are not available at all. Sending people to purchase from other places also yielded nothing. In this case, should construction be suspended and wait for materials? Or should we solve the problem through self-reliance to ensure the progress of the project? At the beginning, many cadres and masses at the construction site believed that they could only suspend construction and wait for materials, wait and see, and the state would eventually find a way. They believed that the equipment was made in factories, and no one on the construction site knew this technology, and without equipment, they couldn't do anything with their bare hands.

In order to eliminate this passive waiting mood and conservative thinking, the Party Committee of the construction site first organized a large debate among cadres and the masses. The main questions debated were: should the reservoir be built quickly and well? Who should be relied on to solve the equipment problem to build the reservoir well? Can the equipment difficulties be solved? Through debate, everyone realized that: if the reservoir is not built quickly, every day the project is delayed, one less jin of grain will be harvested. If the reservoir cannot be built, more than 100,000 mu of land will continue to suffer from drought next year, and tens of millions of jin of grain will be lost. Therefore, everyone came to the conclusion that: it is not enough to just wait for equipment, we should act quickly and find our own solutions. At this time, many people boldly proposed the suggestion of "creating factories with our hands, and breaking through the material barrier with enthusiasm."

But where did the specific methods come from? Under the leadership of the Party Committee, a movement of "offering ideas and finding solutions, and running on-site factories on a large scale" was launched. Cadres and the masses actively participated and immediately established various special research and trial production teams for each project. People learned and searched when they didn't understand the technology. For example, the cement group didn't know how cement was made at all, so they made a special trip to visit the factory in Nanchang. After the visit, they learned some things, but the factory used a vertical kiln, which costs two to three hundred yuan to build and takes more than a month to complete. This was not only too expensive for the construction site, but also time was not allowed; in addition, the factory used a fine sieve with 49,000 eyes per square meter to sift ash, which could not be bought at the construction site. So they imitated the form of the vertical kiln and built a small brick kiln with broken bricks and burned the clay dug from the mountains. After three days and three nights of experiments and multiple failures, they finally burned two jin of low-grade cement. They further studied and improved the technology, and then 400-grade cement was also successful. The steel group also used waste steel donated by the commune members to trial-produce various specifications of steel, and tried to eliminate the cracks that appeared in hand-forged iron. The explosives group also found a local method of refining saltpeter, using the saltpeter soil from the old walls of the houses after the commune members moved on the construction site to extract potassium nitrate, and then mixed it with sulfur and fir charcoal to make local explosives. Experiments proved that the explosive force was comparable to 70% of that of yellow explosives. The detonator group also did not want to lag behind. Wang Boru, a demobilized soldier, used scrap tin and the red medicine used on shotguns to make local detonators. These local methods, manufacturing technology and equipment are very simple, so in less than ten days, cement plants, steel plants, explosives plants and detonator plants were built on the construction site. Now, the cement plant has four brick kilns of various sizes, and each kiln can produce 25 tons of cement; with the support of commune members donating iron and materials, the steel plant can forge more than 600 jin of steel every day. The explosives plant has thirty-one iron pots for boiling saltpeter. Including boiling saltpeter and mixing, it can produce more than 500 jin of explosives every day. The detonator plant does not produce frequently. When needed, everyone can assemble one in less than a minute. Therefore, the materials needed for the project are supplied from here in a timely manner. At the same time, since these things are mostly made locally from local materials, according to preliminary calculations, the project cost can be reduced by about half compared to the original.

### 上游水库自造器材争得上游  赤手空拳办工厂　冲天干劲找材料  水库修得快又好　供给农田喝个饱

    上游水库自造器材争得上游
    赤手空拳办工厂　冲天干劲找材料
    水库修得快又好　供给农田喝个饱
    编者按：一个更大规模的冬修水利高潮就要来到了。在大修水利运动中，各地需要的建筑器材数量很大。怎样解决器材问题？是坐等上级调拨，还是依靠群众就地制造，就地解决？这是一个大问题，也是实际工作中两条路线的分歧。今天本报发表的江西临川县上游水库，自办工厂，自造器材，保证工程正常进行的消息，对解决这个问题提供了很好的经验，值得各地重视。
    本报南昌电　今年兴修水利，器材缺乏怎么办？江西省临川县上游水库工地经过辩论之后，发动群众用土办法大办工地工厂，自力更生生产各种器材。这样做，不仅保证了工程正常施工和必要的质量，同时还节省了大量投资。
    现在上游水库大办工地工厂的做法，已在临川县各个水利工地上普遍推行，对促进当前水利建设运动的迅速开展起了重大作用。
    上游水库是临川县今年筹建的社办公助的较大型的水利工程之一。受益地区跨七个公社的十多万亩田。按照设计，拦水大坝、长达一百华里的干渠和若干支渠上的各项建筑物共需要水泥三百多吨，钢筋二十四吨。同时，由于干渠要穿过十九座大山，石方工程还需要十多吨炸药和大量雷管。但碰到的困难是：今年国家供应这些器材物资的数量有限，即使照顾较大的工程，分配给的水泥也只及计划的15％，钢筋只及计划的30％，其他炸药等则根本没有。派人到外地采购也一无所获。在这种情况下，是停工待料呢？还是自力更生的解决以保证工程的进行？开始在工地许多干部和群众中认为只有停工待料，等一等再说，反正国家早晚终会给想办法的。他们认为，器材是工厂造的，工地上没人懂得这套技术，没有设备，靠一双空手搞不了。
    为了破除这种消极等待情绪和保守思想，工地党委会首先在干部和群众中组织了大辩论，辩论的主要问题是：要不要又快又好的修好水库？要修好水库依靠谁来解决器材问题？能不能解决器材困难？通过辩论，使大家认识到：如果不抓紧时间修水库，现在工程多拖一天就少收一斤粮，水库修不起，明年十多万亩田就得继续受旱，要损失千万斤粮食。因此大家自己得出结论说：光等待器材是不行的，应赶快行动起来，自己想办法。这时许多人大胆提出了“凭着双手创工厂，干劲突破材料关”的建议。
    但是具体办法从哪里来呢？在党委会的领导下又紧接着开展了一个“献计找计、大办工地工厂”的运动，干部群众积极参加，立即分项目成立了各种专门研究和试制小组。人们不懂得技术就去学、去找。例如，水泥小组根本不知道水泥是怎样做成的，就特地赶到南昌的工厂参观。参观后是学到了一些东西，但工厂用的是立窑，建一个需二、三百元，一个多月才能建成，这对工地来说不仅花钱太多，时间也不允许；另外工厂筛灰用的是每平方公尺四万九千个眼的细筛子，工地也买不到。于是他们就仿照立窑的形式用碎砖头建了座小砖窑，装进从山上挖的粘土试烧，经过三天三夜的试验，多次失败，终于烧出了两斤低标号的水泥。又进一步研究改进技术，接着四百号的水泥也成功了。钢筋小组用社员献的废钢铁也试制成了各种规格的钢筋，并且设法消灭了手工打铁出现的裂缝。炸药小组也找到了土法炼硝的办法，利用工地上社员迁移后的老屋陈墙的硝土提炼出硝酸钾，然后配上硫磺和杉木炭制成了土炸药，试验证明爆炸力抵得上黄色炸药的70％。雷管小组也不甘落后，转业军人王博如用废洋铁皮和猎枪上使用的红药等制成了土雷管。这些土办法，制做技术和设备都很简单，所以不到十天工夫，在工地上就建起了水泥厂、钢筋厂、炸药厂和雷管厂。现在，水泥厂共有大小四座砖窑，每出一次窑即可产水泥二十五吨；钢筋厂在社员献铁献料的支援下，每天可以打制钢筋六百多斤。炸药厂共有三十一口铁锅熬硝，连熬硝带配制每天可以生产炸药五百多斤。雷管厂不经常生产，需要时每人不到一分钟就可以装好一个。因此工程所需要的器材都及时从这里得到了供应。同时由于这些东西大都是就地取材自己制造的，据初步核算，工程造价还可比原来降低一半左右。
