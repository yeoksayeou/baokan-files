Title: The Two Parties Are Just a Pair of Twin Dogs: Alternating Turns Won't Change U.S. Policy

The Beirut newspaper "Al-Sharq" published an editorial on the 6th entitled "Looking at the U.S. Elections from an Arab Perspective," stating that after experiencing the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, Arabs now know that the policies of the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties towards Arabs are "nothing more than a pair of twin dogs, one white and the other black, different only in color but identical in nature."

It pointed out that U.S. policy on Arab issues "follows the course and actions of imperialists."

A commentary in Cairo's "Al-Shaab" also said that the defeat of the Republicans and the victory of the Democrats are the same for the people of the Middle East, and the latter's hostility towards the people of the Middle East and Arab nationalism will not be any lighter.

The British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" also held the same view in its editorial on the 6th. The editorial said that on the issue of foreign policy, the attitudes of the Democratic and Republican parties are "so similar" "that Eisenhower could yesterday make a short speech reflecting the facts, saying that this election does not mean any change in the basic direction of American policy."

Austria's "Neues Tageblatt" wrote, "It is generally expected that in the last two years of Eisenhower's administration, he will have a more difficult time dealing with Congress," but the newspaper believes that it should be noted that in the past two years, the U.S. Congress has also had a Democratic majority in both houses.

U.S. news agencies also generally pointed out that the basic direction of U.S. foreign policy will not change, although the implementation of this policy will face more difficulties in the future, and the Democratic Party will cause more "trouble" for the Republican Party on foreign policy in order to accumulate political capital for themselves before the presidential election. United Press International reporter Potts pointed out that, in the final analysis, the Republican Party's basic foreign policy is also the Democratic Party's foreign policy, and the "differences between the two parties on foreign policy are generally on procedural and detail issues, rather than on matters of principle." The Democrats merely want to "embarrass Dulles on matters of method."

    两党不过是一对孪生狗
    轮流出场并不会改变美国政策
    贝鲁特晚报“东方报”在6日以“用阿拉伯人的观点看美国选举”为题发表社论说，经历了杜鲁门政府和艾森豪威尔政府时期的阿拉伯人现在知道，美国共和党人和民主党人对阿拉伯人的政策“不过是一对孪生狗，一只是白的，另一只是黑的，仅仅颜色不同而性质是一模一样的。”
    它指出，美国对阿拉伯问题的政策是“遵循着帝国主义者的方针和行动的”。
    开罗“人民报”的评论也说，共和党的失败和民主党的胜利对中东人民来说是一样的，后者对中东人民和阿拉伯民族主义的敌视态度将不会轻一些。
    英国保守党的“每日电讯报”6日的社论也持有同样的观点。社论说，在外交政策问题上，民主党和共和党的态度是“这样类似”，“以致艾森豪威尔昨天可以发表反映了事实的简短谈话，他说，这次选举并不意味着美国政策的基本方针的任何改变。”
    奥地利“新日报”写道，“普遍预料，在艾森豪威尔执政的最后两年中，他在对付国会方面将有一个较困难的时期”，但是这家报纸认为应当注意到，在过去两年，美国国会两院也是民主党人占多数的。
    美国通讯社也普遍指出，美国的外交政策的基本方针将不会改变，虽然这种政策的执行今后将遭到更多的困难，民主党将在外交政策上更多地找共和党的“麻烦”，以便在总统选举前为自己积累政治资本。合众国际社记者波茨指出，归根到底共和党的基本外交政策也就是民主党的外交政策，两党在外交政策上的“分歧一般是在程序和细节问题上，而不是在原则问题上”，民主党人只不过是想要“在方法问题上使杜勒斯难堪”而已。
