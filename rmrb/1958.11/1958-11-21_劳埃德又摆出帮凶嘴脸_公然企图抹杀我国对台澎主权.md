Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch from London: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in answering questions from members of the House of Commons on the 19th, openly attempted to overturn the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation regarding the return of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to China. He once again erased the Chinese people's sovereignty over these territories and blatantly supported the United States' long-term conspiracy to occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands.

Labor Party member Zilliacus asked Lloyd to what extent the British government's current policy would implement the Cairo Declaration, which stipulated that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands should be returned to China, and the guarantees in the Potsdam Proclamation concerning the execution of the Cairo Declaration's provisions. Lloyd actually said that the British government believes that "the Cairo Declaration, reaffirmed by the Potsdam Proclamation, is only a 'statement of intent.' Both documents were signed at a time when only one entity claimed to represent China. Since then, a civil war has occurred in China, and there are different opinions regarding who now represents the Chinese government."

However, Lloyd did not explain how a country's internal strife could affect its inherent rights to its territory, and how the British government, having recognized the government of the People's Republic of China, could perfidiously cast doubt on the legitimate rights of the legitimate Chinese government.

Lloyd then picked up on the United States government's excuse for interfering in China's internal affairs, saying, "The Formosa (referring to Taiwan) issue has now become an international issue involving a number of countries, and merely mentioning the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation cannot solve this problem." In this way, Lloyd further exposed the British government's shameful role as an active accomplice to the United States' interference in China's internal affairs.

Zilliacus also asked Lloyd whether the British government considers the coastal islands of China to be part of Chinese territory. Lloyd did not dare to deny this. Zilliacus said, "If that is the case, then wouldn't any attempt by the United States to use force to oppose the Chinese government's recovery and occupation of these islands be an act of aggression by the United States?"

At this House of Commons meeting, many Labor Party members also raised the issue of the need to restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Labor Party member Brockway pointed out that the British government was yielding to the United States' will on this issue. Bevan also pointed out that the vast majority of people in Britain and the United States advocate restoring the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. However, Lloyd said in response to these questions that the British government does not intend to study this issue at present.

Speaking of other international issues, Labor Party member Warbey questioned Lloyd on how the British government would deal with the Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe. In his response, Lloyd implied that the British government would not accept this proposal.

Lloyd also responded in writing to a question from a member of the House of Commons regarding Khrushchev's proposal to end the occupation status of Berlin. Lloyd said that he had consulted with the United States, French, and West German governments on this issue. He indicated that the British government would not accept the Soviet proposal.

    劳埃德又摆出帮凶嘴脸
    公然企图抹杀我国对台澎主权
    新华社20日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德19日在下院答复议员质询时公然企图推翻开罗宣言和波茨坦公告关于台湾和澎湖列岛应当归还中国的规定。他再一次抹杀中国人民对这些领土的主权，并且露骨地支持美国长期霸占台湾和澎湖列岛的阴谋。
    工党议员齐里亚库斯问劳埃德，现在英国政府的政策要在多大程度上实施规定台湾和澎湖列岛归还中国的开罗宣言以及波茨坦公告中有关执行开罗宣言条款的保证。劳埃德竟然说，英国政府认为，“由波茨坦公告重新肯定了的开罗宣言只是一项‘意图声明’。这两个文件都是在只有一个单位声称代表中国的时候签订的。自从那时以来，在中国发生了内战，关于现在谁代表中国政府的问题有不同的意见。”
    但是劳埃德没有说明：一国的内争怎么会影响到它对自己领土的固有权利，而英国政府既然承认了中华人民共和国政府，它又怎么能背信弃义地对中国合法政府的合法权利散布怀疑。
    劳埃德接着又捡起了美国政府干涉中国内政的借口说，“福摩萨（指台湾）问题现在已经成了牵涉到一些国家的一个国际问题，光是提到开罗宣言和波茨坦公告是不能解决这个问题的”。劳埃德就是这样进一步暴露了英国政府作为美国干涉中国内政的积极帮凶的可耻面目。
    齐里亚库斯还问劳埃德，英国政府是否认为中国沿海岛屿是中国领土的一部分。劳埃德不敢否认这一点。齐里亚库斯说，“如果是这样，那么美国企图用武力反对中国政府收复和占有这些岛屿的任何尝试岂不是美国的一种侵略行动吗？”
    在这一天下院会议上，还有许多工党议员提出了关于必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位的问题。工党议员布罗克威指出英国政府在这个问题上屈从美国意旨。比万也指出，英国和美国绝大多数人民都是主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位的。但是劳埃德在答复这些问题时却说，目前英国政府不打算研究这个问题。
    在谈到其他国际问题方面，工党议员华贝质问劳埃德，英国政府将如何对待波兰政府关于建立中欧无原子区的建议。劳埃德在回答时暗示英国政府不会接受这种建议。
    劳埃德还以书面形式答复了下院议员提出的关于赫鲁晓夫主张结束柏林的占领状态的建议的问题。劳埃德说，他曾经同美国、法国和西德政府磋商过这一问题。他表明，英国政府不会接受苏联的建议。
