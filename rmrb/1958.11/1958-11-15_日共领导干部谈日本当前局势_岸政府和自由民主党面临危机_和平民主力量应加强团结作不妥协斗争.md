Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The Japanese Communist Party held a lecture meeting in Tokyo on the evening of the 13th. Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, stated in his speech entitled "The Current Situation and the Path the Japanese People Should Take" that some say the present is the biggest crisis in Japan since the war, but this is a crisis for the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party, and for Japan's forces of peace and democracy, this is the first step forward.

In his speech to more than 1,300 citizens, Nosaka strongly condemned the Liberal Democratic Party's treacherous means on November 4 to extend the session of the extraordinary Diet. Nosaka pointed out that the Liberal Democratic Party's act of violence was essentially the same as Hitler's arson in the German Reichstag in 1933. He pointed out that the Japanese people responded to this fascist act of violence by carrying out the largest struggle in history the next day (November 5).

Nosaka said that although the Nobusuke Kishi government has encountered major obstacles, we must not relax our vigilance against it as a result, and future struggles are important.

Nosaka called on the Japanese people to further unite, not compromise with the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party, and fight to the end to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Nosaka's speech deeply moved the audience.

Kotaro Minami, a member of the Cadre Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, gave a speech entitled "The Abolition of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the Tasks of the Japanese Communist Party." Kotaro pointed out that if the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is revised, the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" will be at the mercy of the U.S. military and participate in wars of aggression.

Kotaro strongly condemned the territorial ambitions of the Nobusuke Kishi government toward Taiwan, which is Chinese territory. He emphasized that we must never allow the Nobusuke Kishi government, which pursues an imperialist policy, to linger on.

The audience applauded Kotaro's speech warmly.

Ichizo Suzuki, a member of the Cadre Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out in his speech entitled "The Struggle Against the Revision of the Police Officer Duties Execution Law and the Tasks of the Working Class" that the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet attempted to strangle the Japanese people by passing the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment," but was strongly resisted by the Japanese people, and finally strangled itself with the rope it brought out.

Suzuki called on the Japanese people to further expand the unified action against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" and make it a united front.

Okabayashi Tatsuo, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, thoroughly exposed the conspiracies manufactured by the reactionaries in the trial of the "Matsukawa Incident," and he called on the Japanese people to unite to save the innocent defendants.

    日共领导干部谈日本当前局势
    岸政府和自由民主党面临危机
    和平民主力量应加强团结作不妥协斗争
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本共产党13日晚上在东京举行讲演会，日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三在题为“当前的形势和日本人民应走的道路”的讲演里指出，有人说现在是日本战后以来最大的危机，但是这是岸信介政府和自由民主党的危机，对日本的和平、民主力量来说，这是前进的第一步。
    野坂在向一千三百多市民所作的讲演中，强烈谴责自由民主党在11月4日使用奸诈手段延长国会临时会议会期的暴行。野坂指出，自由民主党的这一暴行，在本质上同希特勒在1933年在德国国会纵火的事件相同。他指出，日本人民在第二天（11月5日），就进行了有史以来最大规模的斗争来答复了自由民主党的这种法西斯暴行。
    野坂说，目前，岸信介政府虽然碰到了大钉子，可是我们千万不要因而放松对它的警惕，今后的斗争是重要的。
    野坂号召日本人民进一步团结起来，不要同岸信介政府和自由民主党妥协，为争取废除日美“安全条约”而斗争到底。野坂的讲演使听众很感动。
    日共中央委员会干部会委员裤田里见作了题为“日美安全条约的废除同日共的任务”的讲演。裤田指出，如果修改了日美“安全条约”，日本“自卫队”就将听任美军操纵参加侵略战争。
    裤田强烈指责岸信介政府对中国领土台湾所抱的领土野心。他强调说，我们绝不能再让奉行帝国主义政策的岸信介政府苟延残喘。
    听众热烈鼓掌欢迎裤田的讲演。
    日共中央委员会干部会委员铃木市藏在题为“反对修改警察官职务执行法的斗争和工人阶级的任务”的讲演里指出，岸信介内阁企图通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”来扼住日本人民的颈骨，但是遭到日本人民的强烈反击，终于以自己拿出来的绳子绞住了自己的颈子。
    铃木号召日本人民进一步扩大反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的统一行动，使它成为统一战线。
    日共中央委员会委员冈林辰雄在讲演中彻底揭露了反动派在“松川事件”审判中所制造的阴谋，他呼吁日本人民为拯救无辜被告而团结起来。
