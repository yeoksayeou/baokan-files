　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th -- According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency, Premier Kim Il-sung spoke to farmers on the 15th about the bright and happy communist prospects of the Korean people. He pointed out that after the production of grains and cloth is greatly increased, the problems of food and clothing for the Korean people will be completely resolved, and Korea will stand at the door of communism. He said, "The Korean people see this as something in front of their eyes, not something in the distant future." He emphasized that communist education must be strengthened among members of agricultural cooperatives.

　　In his speech, Premier Kim Il-sung emphasized that the faster the socialist construction in the northern half of Korea proceeds, the sooner the peaceful reunification of Korea will be completed. He said that all members of the cooperative should work harder to strive for the arrival of the day of the reunification of the motherland.

　　Premier Kim Il-sung said this to cooperative members when he inspected the Samryong Agricultural Cooperative in Sunchon County, South Pyongan Province. This cooperative has had a bumper harvest this year, and the members plan to plant some experimental fields, and next year harvest 150 tons of corn per hectare (equivalent to 20,000 jin per mu) in two hectares of dry land.

　　When Premier Kim Il-sung talked to the members about the prospects of agricultural mechanization in Korea, he said that every seventy hectares (equivalent to 1,050 mu) of cultivated land should be equipped with one tractor and an appropriate number of trucks. When the members said that they could use this year's income to buy tractors and trucks, Premier Kim Il-sung said that tractors and trucks could be handed over to them soon.

　　He suggested that the members raise more cows so that they can drink milk every day. He said that each member should raise at least two or three hens, and vigorously plant fruit trees so that the members can get more fruit.

    金日成首相向朝鲜农民发出号召
    加速社会主义建设早日实现和平统一
    强调对农业合作社社员必须加强共产主义教育
    新华社平壤16日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，朝鲜内阁首相金日成15日向农民谈到了朝鲜人民光明幸福的共产主义前景。他指出，在谷物和布匹的生产量大大提高以后，朝鲜人民的衣食问题将完全得到解决，朝鲜将站在共产主义的门口。他说，“朝鲜人民把这看作是他们眼前的事情，而不是遥远的将来的事情”。他强调在农业合作社社员当中必须加强共产主义教育。
    金日成首相在谈话中强调指出，朝鲜北半部的社会主义建设进行得越快，朝鲜的和平统一就会越早完成。他说，合作社的全体社员应该为争取祖国统一这一天的到来而更加努力地工作。
    金日成首相是在平安南道顺川郡的三龙农业社进行视察时，对合作社社员这样说的。这个社今年丰产，社员们计划再种些试验田，明年在两公顷旱田里每公顷收获玉米一百五十吨（合每亩两万市斤）。
    金日成首相对社员们谈到朝鲜农业机械化的远景时说，每七十公顷（合一千零五十亩）耕地应当配备一台拖拉机和适当数量的卡车。当社员们说他们能够用今年的收入买拖拉机和卡车时，金日成首相说，很快就可以把拖拉机和卡车交给他们。
    他建议社员们养更多的母牛，以使社员们每天能够喝到牛奶。他说，每个社员至少应该养两三只母鸡，并且大力栽种果树，使社员们得到更多的水果。
