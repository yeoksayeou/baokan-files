Miao Songs and Paintings
Poems: Selected from Miao folk songs of Guizhou and Hunan provinces
Paintings: "Harvest in the Miao Mountains" by Wu Chengqun, a farmer from Hunan

    Which village doesn't have much grain?
    There are many villages along the highway,
    Like money strung on a gourd,
    Which gourd doesn't hold treasure,
    Which village doesn't have much grain?
    The newly opened ditch is long and long,
    Winding and turning along the mountain ridge;
    The ditch water flows endlessly every day,
    And we have a bumper harvest with full granaries every year.
    The Sweet Potato King
    Terraced fields on the mountainside, a river below,
    Many sweet potatoes are planted on the mountaintop.
    Last night, a heavy rain,
    Washed a sweet potato king down the slope,
    Knocking down dozens of small trees,
    Washing away more than twenty field ridges,
    "Plop" it rolled into the big river,
    The river water splashed more than three zhang high,
    Commune members ran to see what happened upon hearing the sound,
    Turned out to be a sweet potato blocking the river.
    Every Clump of Rice Deserves to Be Called King
    One pomegranate tree has four branches,
    Thousands of branches are blooming,
    As long as we farm well in the spring,
    We will surely have a good harvest in the autumn.
    The autumn wind blows so cool,
    Every clump of rice deserves to be called "king."
    In previous years, we harvested a handful from several clumps,
    This year, we harvest several pairs of hands from one clump.
    The Fragrance of Rice Can Be Smelled Across the Mountains
    The mountain songs become fresher and fresher as they are sung,
    Piles of cotton accumulate like snow mountains;
    Girls sing in the white clouds,
    It's hard to tell the difference between heaven and earth.
    Golden crops grow all over the slopes,
    Harvest songs are heard everywhere;
    This year's grain cannot be carried away,
    We have to use thousands of trucks to haul it.
    Every grain shines with golden light,
    The fragrance of rice can be smelled across the mountains,
    Good grain supports industrialization,
    To exchange for an iron ox for the farm. (Attached picture)

    苗家歌画
    诗：选自贵州、湖南两省的苗族民歌
    画：湖南农民吴成群的“苗岭丰收图”
    哪个村庄粮不多
    公路两旁村庄多，
    好比金钱串葫芦，
    哪个葫芦不盛宝，
    哪个村庄粮不多。
    新开水沟长又长，
    弯弯曲曲流山岗；
    日日沟水流不尽，
    年年丰收谷满仓。
    薯王
    山腰梯田山下河，
    山顶红薯种得多。
    昨夜一场倾盆雨，
    把个薯王洗下坡，
    小树压倒几十棵，
    田坎冲断二十多，
    “扑通”滚进大河里，
    河水溅起三丈多，
    社员闻声跑来看，
    原来是一条白薯塞断河。
    窝窝稻谷都称王
    一棵石榴四枝丫，
    千个枝头都开花，
    只要春耕种得好，
    秋收准是好庄稼。
    秋风吹来好清凉，
    窝窝稻谷都称“王”。
    往年几窝割一把，
    今年一窝割几双。
    隔山闻见谷子香
    山歌越唱越新鲜，
    棉花堆集像雪山；
    姑娘唱歌白云里，
    难分天上与人间。
    金黄庄稼长满坡，
    处处响起丰收歌；
    今年粮食挑不完，
    得用千辆汽车拖。
    颗颗谷子闪金光，
    隔山闻见谷子香，
    好粮支援工业化，
    换个铁牛到农庄。（附图片）
