    The Red Flag of the October Revolution Will Always Inspire Us to Advance
    Ma Fengshan, Captain of the Babaoshan Brigade of the Shijingshan People's Commune, Former Director of the China-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Our entire membership of the China-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative are welcoming the great festival of mankind – the 41st anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution – amidst the intense battle of deep plowing on a large scale. These are forty-one years filled with the glory of victory, forty-one years of struggle. We, along with all the Soviet people, celebrate this joyous day that thrills the world!
    Forty-one years ago today, the red flag of the October Revolution was firmly raised on Soviet soil. The red flag was raised higher and higher, becoming more and more vibrant. Like a magnet, and like a radiant sun, it attracted and illuminated the hearts of all oppressed brothers in the world. From here, they saw hope and found a path to completely break free from slavery and poverty, and move towards light and happiness. The sound of the October Revolution's cannon brought Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese people. Our beloved Party and Chairman Mao, combined with the specific conditions of the Chinese revolution, creatively applied Marxism-Leninism, leading the people of the whole country to resolutely take the path of the October Revolution, liberating the 500 million farmers across the country from thousands of years of feudal oppression and extreme poverty. On the land of China, the red flag of the October Revolution also victoriously flies.
    Under the leadership of the Party, our cooperative has moved from poverty to prosperity. Now, more than 80% of the members of the cooperative have reached the living standards of middle peasants. But we are by no means satisfied. In August, during the upsurge of the national movement to establish people's communes, according to the unanimous demands of all members, we merged with the neighboring four agricultural cooperatives, as well as large industrial enterprises such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and the Shijingshan Power Plant, to form the Shijingshan People's Commune. Moreover, since October 1, the entire commune has begun to implement a brand-new system of half-wage, half-supply, providing free meals, clothing, and education to its members. This is a miracle never seen in thousands of years of Chinese history. The members celebrated with gongs and drums that they had taken a big step towards communism. The members all expressed: From now on, there will only be one thought, which is to wholeheartedly improve production and strive for bumper harvests again and again! They are full of confidence in achieving communism ahead of schedule. This confidence comes from the wise leadership and education of the Party and Chairman Mao, and also from the encouragement of the heroic Soviet people.
    The members of our China-Soviet Friendship Cooperative often speak to people with gratitude and pride about the friendship between our Soviet elder brother and us. Since we were named the China-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in 1956, we have received more assistance and care from our Soviet elder brother. During this period, we not only established close friendships with the Ilyich Collective Farm in Moscow Oblast, USSR, and the Stalin Collective Farm in the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, conducting production competitions to encourage each other; moreover, many Soviet guests and expert comrades who came to our country visited and guided our cooperative, giving us selfless help in all aspects, including ideology, work, and material. We deeply know that everything we already have is inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union. The Soviet elder brother is a large red flag that never fades, and it will always be our role model.
    The practical actions of the Chinese and Soviet people in building a beautiful socialist and communist society are a huge and irresistible force for defending world peace. In this historical era where the East wind prevails over the West wind, our people are truly the masters of their own destiny. "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion is so clear! Our agricultural cooperative members must unite with the people of the whole country, be ready at all times to complete the great cause of the motherland's reunification, and to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu; our agricultural cooperative members must continue to unite with the Soviet people and with all peace-loving people in the world, and tirelessly fight to defend world lasting peace, to thoroughly liberate all the oppressed people in the world, so that all the people of the world can unite around the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, raising the red flag of the October Revolution higher and planting it all over the world!

    十月革命的红旗永远鼓舞我们前进
    石景山人民公社八宝山大队队长前中苏友好农业生产合作社主任
  马凤山
    我们中苏友好农业生产合作社的全体社员，在紧张的大面积深翻土地的战斗中迎接了人类伟大的节日——苏联十月革命四十一周年纪念日。这是充满着胜利光辉的四十一年，是战斗的四十一年。我们和全体苏联人民一起，同庆这个举世欢腾的好日子！
    四十一年前的今天，十月革命的红旗牢固地在苏联土地上升起来了，红旗越举越高，越来越鲜艳，她像吸铁石，又像一个光辉的太阳，吸引着、照耀着世界上一切受压迫的弟兄们的心，他们从这里看到了希望，找到了彻底摆脱奴役和贫困、走向光明和幸福的道路。十月革命一声炮响，给中国人民送来了马克思列宁主义，我们亲爱的党和毛主席，结合中国革命的具体情况，创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义，领导全国人民坚决走十月革命的道路，把全国五亿农民从几千年封建压迫和极端贫困的境遇中解放出来。在中国的土地上，十月革命的红旗也胜利地飘扬起来了。
    在党的领导下，我们的合作社由贫困走向了富裕，现在，全社80％以上的社员已经达到了中农生活水平，但是我们绝不满足，8月间，在全国大搞人民公社化运动的高潮中，我们根据全体社员一致的要求，与附近的四个农业社，以及石景山钢铁公司、石景山发电厂等大工业企业合并成立了石景山人民公社。并且，从10月1日起，全社开始实行社员吃饭、穿衣、教育等免费供应的半工资半供给的崭新制度，这是中国几千年历史上从来没有过的奇迹，社员们敲锣打鼓欢庆自己向共产主义又迈进了一大步。社员们都表示：今后只有一个心思了，就是全心全意把生产搞得更好，力争丰收再丰收！对提前实现共产主义充满了信心。这个信心来自党和毛主席的英明领导和教育，也来自英雄的苏联人民的鼓舞。
    我们中苏友好社的社员们，经常是怀着感激和骄傲的心情，向人们述说着苏联老大哥和我们的友谊。自从我们在1956年命名为中苏友好农业生产合作社以来，我们得到了苏联老大哥更多的援助和关怀。这期间，我们不但和苏联莫斯科州伊里奇集体农庄、白俄罗斯加盟共和国斯大林集体农庄建立了亲密的友谊，开展了生产竞赛以互相鼓舞；而且，许多来到我国的苏联贵宾和专家同志们，都到我们社来访问、指导，给了我们思想上、工作上以及物质上等各方面的无私帮助。我们深深知道，我们已经有的一切，都是和苏联的帮助分不开的。苏联老大哥是一面永不褪色的大红旗，永远是我们学习的榜样。
    中苏两国人民建设美好的社会主义、共产主义的实际行动，是一股巨大的、不可抗拒的保卫世界和平的力量。在这东风压倒西风的历史时代，我们人民是真正掌握自己命运的主人。“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”，毛主席这个英明论断说得多么透亮！我们农业社员们要和全国人民一道，为完成祖国统一的大业、为解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖而时刻准备着；我们农业社员仍要和苏联人民、和全世界爱好和平的人们一道，为保卫世界持久和平，为彻底解放全世界受压迫的人民而不懈战斗，让全世界人民都团结在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营周围，把十月革命的红旗举得更高，插遍全世界！
