Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 15th. Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, delivered a radio address on the eve of the election day (November 16th). He called on voters to actively participate in the voting, "Let the vote become an enthusiastic expression of trust in the party and the government."

Dobi said: "Based on the great achievements already made, the Party and the government have reason to ask the Hungarian people to cast a vote of confidence, and use millions of votes to strengthen our alliance of workers and peasants. Use the vote to show that we are wholeheartedly loyal to the unity of the socialist camp." Dobi said: We are strong, and millions of votes should "warn all those who hate us," and "become an encouraging and driving force, so that the Party and the government, relying on the results of the elections and the national unity shown in the elections, can work better, more clearly, and more resolutely for the people, for the motherland, for development, and for socialism than in the past."

Dobi reviewed the achievements of the past two years. He said that these two years were difficult years, but also truly beautiful years. The mutual trust between our Party, the Party and state leadership, and the broad masses is unprecedented in history. The Western leadership groups are hostile to us and also slander us. They were disappointed in 1956, but they were equally disappointed in 1957 and 1958.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 15th. Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government Premier Münnich held a press conference here on the 15th and answered various questions raised by reporters.

When talking about the elections for the National Assembly and local councils to be held on the 16th, Münnich said: The achievements of Hungary in the past two years have strengthened the people's trust in the Party and the government. The fact that more than 50% of voters participated in the nomination conferences for deputies and representative candidates is the best proof of this trust.

Münnich said that the democracy shown in the nomination of candidates is unprecedented in Hungarian history.

A reporter asked what attitude the Hungarian government holds towards the plan proposed by the Polish government to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. Münnich replied: We have always welcomed all initiatives that can prevent atomic war with pleasure. (Attached picture)

    道比和明尼赫谈匈议会选举
    让选举成为推动前进的力量
    两年来的成就加强了人民对党和政府的信任
    新华社布达佩斯15日电　匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比，在选举日（16日）前夕发表了广播演说。他号召选民踊跃参加投票，“让选票成为对党和政府的信任的热烈的表现”。
    道比说：“党和政府在已获得的巨大成就的基础上，有理由要求匈牙利人民投信任票，用几百万张选票来加强我们的工农联盟。用选票来表明我们是全心全意忠实于社会主义阵营的团结。”道比说：我们是强有力的，应该让几百万张选票“警告仇视我们的一切人”，“成为鼓励和推动的力量，使党和政府依靠选举的结果和在选举中表现的民族团结，比过去更好地、更明确地、更坚决地为人民、为祖国、为发展、为社会主义而工作”。
    道比回顾了过去两年来的成就。他说，这两年是困难的两年，但也是真正美好的两年。我们的党、党和国家的领导同广大群众之间的相互信任是历史上从来没有过的。西方领导集团在仇视我们，也在诬蔑我们，它们在1956年失望了，但在1957年和1958年也同样是失望的。
    新华社布达佩斯15日电　匈牙利工农革命政府总理明尼赫15日在这里举行记者招待会，回答了记者提出的各个问题。
    在谈到将在16日举行的国民议会和地方会议的选举时，明尼赫说：匈牙利两年来的成就加强了人民对党和政府的信任。有50％以上的选民参加了议员和代表候选人的提名大会，这就是这种信任的最好的证明。
    明尼赫说，在提名候选人当中所表现的民主，是匈牙利历史上前所未有的。
    有记者问，匈牙利政府对波兰政府提出的关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的计划抱什么态度，明尼赫回答说：我们一向以高兴的心情欢迎所有能够防止原子战争的倡议。（附图片）
