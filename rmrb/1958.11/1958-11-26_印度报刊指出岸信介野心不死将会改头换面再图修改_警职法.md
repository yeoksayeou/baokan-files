Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 25th: The "Times of India" published an editorial today commenting on the fact that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi was forced to temporarily shelve the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment," saying, "Clearly, he could not deal with the rising tide of popular opposition to the new measures."

The newspaper said that the protests and demonstrations held by the Japanese people against the bill show that "the broad masses of people will fight to the end against measures they consider an attack on their democratic rights."

The newspaper explained the reasons why people from all walks of life in Japan oppose this bill, saying, "Workers believe that this bill is an attack on their union rights. Teachers fear, after the government's recent attempts to remove radicals from their ranks, that this bill is a new means to achieve the same purpose. Many apolitical people worry that the government may use the new police powers to prevent mass demonstrations against nuclear testing and rearmament."

The newspaper warned that "it is futile to pretend that the Japanese government has abandoned its plan to grant the police new powers." The newspaper also believes that Nobusuke Kishi will re-introduce the bill in a modified form.

Some time ago, the "New Age" weekly pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke group's submission of this reactionary bill to the Diet is part of an action to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the purpose of which is "not only to perpetuate the alliance between Japan and U.S. imperialism, but also to revive Japanese militarism."

The weekly said, "After setbacks in West Asia and intensified provocations in the East, the U.S. ruling clique is now further strengthening its control over Japan." It said that the new treaty to be signed by Japan and the United States after negotiations to revise the "Security Treaty" will grant "the United States the legitimate right to occupy Japan" and pave the way for "the U.S. conspiracy to link Japan with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other military treaties."

    印度报刊指出岸信介野心不死将会改头换面再图修改“警职法”
    新华社新德里25日电　“印度时报”今天发表社论，评论日本首相岸信介被迫暂时搁置“警察官职务执行法修正案”这件事说，“显然，他无法对付日益高涨的人民反对新措施的浪潮”。
    报纸说，日本人民为反对这项法案而举行的抗议示威表明，“广大人民对于他们认为是进攻他们的民主权利的措施是会斗争到底的”。
    这家报纸解释日本各阶层人民反对这项法案的原因说，“工人们认为这个法案是对他们工会的权利的进攻。教师们在政府最近试图从他们的队伍中清除激进分子之后担心，这个法案是为了达到同一目的的新手段。许多不关心政治的人都担心政府可能利用新的警察权力来阻止群众反对核试验和重新武装的示威”。
    报纸警告说，“佯称日本政府已经放弃它授予警察新的权力的计划是徒然的”报纸并且认为，岸信介将用改头换面的方法再次提出这个法案。
    前些时候，“新世纪”周刊指出，岸信介集团向国会提出这项反动法案，是修改日美“安全条约”的行动的一个部分，其目的“不仅在于使日本同美帝国主义的联盟永久化，而且是要复活日本的军国主义”。
    这家周刊说，“美国统治集团在西亚遭受挫折和在东方加紧进行挑衅之后，现在又在进一步加强他们对日本的控制”。它说，日美在进行修改“安全条约”谈判后将要签订的新条约将给予“美国占领日本的合法权利”，并为“美国把日本同东南亚条约组织、北大西洋公约组织和其他军事条约联结起来的阴谋”开辟道路。
