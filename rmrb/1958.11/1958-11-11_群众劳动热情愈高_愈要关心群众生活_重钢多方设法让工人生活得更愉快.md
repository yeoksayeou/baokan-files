The Higher the Labor Enthusiasm of the Masses, the More We Must Care for Their Lives
Chongqing Steel Works Takes Various Measures to Make Workers' Lives More Pleasant

(Our newspaper Chongqing dispatch of the 10th) The Chongqing Steel Company is vigorously strengthening the management of the employees' livelihood and welfare, caring for the workers' lives in many ways, so that the workers can live more happily in the tense labor.

In the past two months or so, the labor enthusiasm of the Chongqing Steel Company's employees has become increasingly vigorous. Many people have given up their rest time and broken the rules to work day and night to rush production; the workers in some workshops have even automatically changed the three-shift system to a two-shift system, working more than eight hours a day. The company leaders realize that in the current situation of unprecedented high labor enthusiasm of the employees, special attention should be paid to caring for everyone's lives, so that they can work with peace of mind and not worry about household chores.

After breaking the rules in production, the most prominent problem is the eating time. The company is currently opening a large number of collective canteens and strengthening the management of collective canteens to reduce the trouble of workers cooking their own meals. More than 70 collective canteens have now been set up in the factory area and workers' residential areas. The collective canteens in the factory area are open around the clock, so that people who cannot leave their production posts on time due to rushing to work can eat hot meals at any time. In the past, collective canteens implemented many systems such as grain coupons, meal tickets, and vegetable tickets for the convenience of management; now, in order not to waste workers' time due to queuing and handling procedures, the cumbersome procedures have been greatly simplified, and management personnel are sent to the workshops to sell tickets to give workers as much convenience as possible. The management personnel and cooks of each collective canteen have launched a competition, and most canteens have managed to eat fresh vegetables and meat every day despite the relatively difficult food supply. For workers who implement the two-shift system, the company also gives each worker a daily subsidy of six taels of noodles and provides a free hot steamed bun as a snack.

This year, more than 80% of the company's employees' families have participated in production labor. After a large number of employees' families participated in labor, the time spent on household chores has been reduced. In order to strengthen the management and education of employees' children, the company is developing a large number of nurseries and kindergartens. Up to now, in addition to the expansion of the company's public nurseries and kindergartens to accommodate more children, 12 private nurseries have been organized by the employees' families, enrolling more than 1,000 children. With the assistance of teachers and students from Chongqing Normal School, the company is currently preparing to develop a second batch of nurseries and kindergartens and improve the quality of work in the nurseries and kindergartens. For children who cannot temporarily enter nurseries or kindergartens, the company's trade union and employees' families also organize them to participate in collective activities so that they can live a regular life. Each workshop has recently added lactation rooms and temporary nurseries to facilitate more female employees to bring their children to the workshop to breastfeed.

In addition, with the assistance of the company's leaders, the personnel of the company's commercial department are also actively improving the supply of food, department stores and other commodities. The main restaurants and department store outlets in the factory area have also implemented round-the-clock business hours from November.

While working hard, the cultural and entertainment life of the employees is also becoming richer and richer. Sichuan Opera, Peking Opera, drama, song and dance and other art groups in Chongqing often come to the company for touring performances. The real people and real events in the factory are also often brought to the stage. The new records that appear on the first day and the winning teams that win the flag are often adapted into opera programs the next day. In order to take care of the workers' rest, each workshop has greatly reduced the meeting time by improving the quality of the meetings, so that each worker can get proper rest.

    群众劳动热情愈高  愈要关心群众生活
    重钢多方设法让工人生活得更愉快
    本报重庆10日电　重庆钢铁公司大力加强职工生活福利的管理工作，从多方面关心工人生活，使职工群众在紧张的劳动中，生活得更加愉快。
    最近两个多月来，重庆钢铁公司职工劳动热情越来越旺盛，许多人放弃休息时间，打破常规日夜突击生产；有的车间的工人更自动将三班制改为两班制，每天工作时间超过八小时以上。公司领导认识到在职工劳动热情空前高涨的情况下，要特别注意关心大家生活，使他们既能够安心生产，又不为家务事操心。
    生产上打破常规以后，最突出的是吃饭时间问题。这个公司最近正在大量开办集体食堂和加强集体食堂的管理工作，以减少职工自己做饭的麻烦。在厂区和职工住宅区，现在已办起了七十多个集体食堂。厂区集体食堂昼夜二十四小时轮流开饭，使突击赶工不能按时离开生产岗位的人随时可以吃到热菜热饭。过去集体食堂为了管理工作上的方便，实行了粮票、饭票、菜票等许多制度；现在为了不使工人因排队和办理手续等耽误时间，繁琐的手续已大大简化，并且实行了管理人员到车间售票，尽量给工人方便。各个集体食堂的管理人员和炊事人员开展了竞赛，大部分食堂都在食品供应比较困难的情况下，做到了每天都能吃到新鲜蔬菜和肉食。对实行两班制的工人，公司还特别给每个工人每天津贴六两面，免费供应一顿热馒头作为加餐。
    今年公司职工家属中有80％以上参加了生产劳动。大批职工家属参加劳动后，料理家务的时间减少了。为了加强职工子弟的管理和教育，这个公司正在大量发展托儿所和幼儿园。到目前为止，除公司公共托儿所和幼儿园扩大了收容名额外，已组织职工家属开办了十二个民办托儿所，招收了一千多名幼儿。在重庆市师范学校教师和学生的协助下，这个公司最近正在准备发展第二批托儿所、幼儿园和提高托儿所和幼儿园的工作质量。对于暂时还不能进托儿所或幼儿园的儿童，公司工会和职工家属也把他们组织起来参加集体活动，使他们生活得有规律。各车间最近还增加了哺乳室和临时托儿所，便利更多的女职工把孩子带到车间哺乳。
    此外在公司领导的协助下，这个公司的商业部门的人员也积极改进食品百货等商品的供应工作。厂区主要餐厅和百货门市部并从11月份起，实行了通宵营业。
    在紧张劳动的同时，职工们的文化娱乐生活也越来越丰富。重庆市的川剧、京剧、话剧、歌舞等艺术团体都经常到这个公司巡回演出。厂里的真人真事也常被搬上舞台，头天出现的新纪录和夺得帅旗的优胜班组，往往第二天就被编成了戏曲节目。各个车间为了照顾工人休息，都从提高会议质量着手大大减少开会时间，使每个工人都能得到适当休息。
