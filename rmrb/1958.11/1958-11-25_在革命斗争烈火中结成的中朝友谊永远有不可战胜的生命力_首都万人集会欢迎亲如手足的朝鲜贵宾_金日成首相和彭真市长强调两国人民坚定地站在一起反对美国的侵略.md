Xinhua News Agency, 24th dispatch. Over ten thousand people from all walks of life in the capital gathered at the Beijing Gymnasium this afternoon, warmly welcoming the respected leader of the Korean people, Premier Kim Il-sung, and all the distinguished guests of the Korean government delegation, enthusiastically cheering the unbreakable friendship forged in blood between the peoples of China and North Korea, and wishing that this friendship, along with the infinite prosperity of the two countries, would make even greater contributions to world peace and the great cause of socialism.

At 4:10 PM, Premier Kim Il-sung and all the distinguished guests of the Korean government delegation, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and Mayor Peng Zhen, Vice Premiers He Long and Chen Yi, and Vice Chairmen Li Jishen and Guo Moruo, walked into the venue and ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the band played joyful music, and ten thousand people stood up to welcome the distinguished guests with smiles, applauding warmly and rhythmically for a long time. Dozens of boys and girls ran onto the rostrum, presenting flowers to Premier Kim Il-sung, to comrades Park Jung-ae, Nam Il, Kim Kwang-hyup, Lee Il-kyung, and Lee Young-ho, and to all the distinguished Korean guests.

Comrades from the Korean military delegation and the Korean Embassy in China also attended the meeting.

A storm of applause swept the venue as Premier Kim Il-sung, facing ten thousand smiling faces, delivered a lengthy speech. When the Premier, in the name of the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Korean people, extended heartfelt and warm fraternal greetings to all the Chinese people, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause that lasted for a long time.

The Premier praised the great friendship between the two peoples with passionate words. He said, "There is a proletarian internationalist relationship of friendly cooperation between the peoples of Korea and China. The friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China have been formed through long-term common struggles and have been consolidated and developed in the flames of revolutionary struggle." The Premier said, "No force can destroy the great friendship between the peoples of Korea and China, and no force can overcome the united strength of our two peoples." "In the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the construction of socialism, the friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China are invaluable. Through arduous struggles, our people have experienced the invincible vitality of the friendship and solidarity with the Chinese people. In the future, we will continue to contribute all our strength to strengthening the traditional friendship and mutual cooperation between the peoples of Korea and China. The Korean people will always be comrades-in-arms who share weal and woe with the Chinese people."

After eloquently describing the rapidly developing socialist construction in both countries, the Premier said excitedly, "Today, we are living in an advantageous situation where the forces of peace and socialism have an absolute advantage over the forces of war and imperialism." "All the countries of the socialist camp, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, are closely united around the Soviet Union, unprecedentedly strengthening the power of the socialist camp. This is the most steadfast guarantee for the victory of peace and socialism."

The Premier sternly condemned the international reactionaries and their lackey revisionists for their conspiracies to undermine the unity of the socialist camp, pointing out that "historical experience has proven that in this world, no force can destroy the unity of the socialist camp. Anyone who tries to undermine it will surely suffer the same failure as in the past."

The Premier pointed out, "The imperialist aggressors, headed by the United States, are unwilling to face the changed situation and are even more unwilling to learn the lessons they should have learned from their shameful failures."

"U.S. imperialism, colluding with the human garbage such as Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Ngo Dinh Diem, who have been abandoned by the people, is trying to save its dying fate. It is also attempting to revive Japanese militarism and turn Japan into a U.S. base of aggression in the Far East. All this is simply like grasping at a straw when drowning, trying to prolong its last gasp."

The Premier said that the measure of the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea "once again proves the sincere efforts of the Chinese people to promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to ease the tense situation in the Far East."

The Premier once again emphasized, "The United States has no excuse to legitimize its military occupation of South Korea, and they should withdraw from South Korea."

The Premier sternly condemned the recent serious provocations by U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait region against the Chinese people. He warned, "If U.S. imperialism does not accept the lessons of its repeated failures in its policy of aggression and its disastrous defeat in the Korean War, and ignores the serious warnings of the Chinese people and the denunciation of the people of the socialist camp countries, headed by the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving people, and dares to expand its provocations, then, in the final analysis, it will surely be buried."

The Premier said, "The Korean people, who are flesh and blood with the Chinese people in the common struggle against a common enemy, will always stand firmly on the side of the Chinese people in the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and in defense of peace."

Premier Kim Il-sung finally said with full confidence that the Korean people believe in the correctness of their great cause, "We will surely firmly defend the peaceful frontier of Korea, and we will surely achieve final victory in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of our motherland."

Every sentence of Premier Kim Il-sung's speech won long-lasting and warm applause from the entire venue. After Premier Kim Il-sung finished his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Mayor Peng Zhen warmly shook hands with the Premier, thanking him for his friendly and enthusiastic speech.

Mayor Peng Zhen delivered a warm speech at the beginning of the welcoming meeting, welcoming the distinguished guests.

Mayor Peng Zhen said that the friendship between China and North Korea was established and developed in the long-term revolutionary struggle against a common enemy. It is based on the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism, is eternal and unbreakable, and its strength is invincible.

Mayor Peng Zhen highly praised the great achievements made by the Korean people in their socialist construction. He said, "Just as in the war against the American aggressors, we regard every achievement of the Korean people in peaceful construction as our own achievement. We believe that the industrious and brave Korean people, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, will surely achieve even greater and more brilliant victories!"

Mayor Peng Zhen emphasized that the people of both our countries are engaged in a vigorous socialist construction, but we have not forgotten for a moment the aggression and threats of U.S. imperialism against our two countries. "U.S. imperialism was, is, and remains the most dangerous common enemy of the Chinese and Korean peoples. The Chinese people firmly support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and firmly believe that the Korean people's struggle is bound to be victorious. U.S. imperialism can neither prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, nor can it prevent the three thousand li of rivers and mountains of Korea from being unified. The era in which U.S. imperialism could arbitrarily run rampant in the East is over. Its perverse actions will only accelerate its own demise."

Mayor Peng Zhen concluded by saying, "Now, the Korean people are advancing victoriously, the Chinese people are advancing victoriously, and the countries of the socialist camp, headed by the great Soviet Union, are all advancing victoriously. The national revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing, and the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace is continuing to surge. In our new world, everything is full of vigor, and everything is developing prosperously." "We represent the trend of historical development, we represent the direction of human progress, we represent light, and we represent peace. We firmly believe that light will surely overcome darkness, progress will surely overcome reaction, and peace will surely overcome war. Final victory will surely belong to us!"

Mayor Peng Zhen also presented flags and gifts to Premier Kim Il-sung and the distinguished guests of the Korean government delegation on behalf of the people of the capital. When the flags and gifts were presented, the entire venue once again stood up and applauded warmly, expressing their high respect to the distinguished guests.

This afternoon, the heads of various departments of state organs, people's organizations, democratic parties, and departments of Beijing Municipality, as well as senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, together with people from all walks of life, attended the meeting to warmly welcome the distinguished guests.

After the grand and warm welcoming meeting ended, a grand welcoming performance began. Artists from the Volunteer Army Cultural Troupe and the capital performed wonderful Chinese and Korean song and dance programs. After the performance, when Premier Kim Il-sung and others, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and others, walked out of the gymnasium hall, the people lined the streets to bid farewell. At this moment, the sound of applause and cheers, aroused by the friendship between China and North Korea, lingered in the night sky of the gymnasium for a long time. (Attached picture)

    在革命斗争烈火中结成的中朝友谊永远有不可战胜的生命力
    首都万人集会欢迎亲如手足的朝鲜贵宾
    金日成首相和彭真市长强调两国人民坚定地站在一起反对美国的侵略
    新华社24日讯　首都各界人民一万多人今天下午齐集北京体育馆，盛情欢迎朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成首相和朝鲜政府代表团的全体贵宾，热烈欢呼中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的牢不可破的友谊，祝这种友谊随着两国的无限繁荣，对世界和平和社会主义伟大事业作出更加重大的贡献。
    下午四时十分，金日成首相和朝鲜政府代表团的全体贵宾由周恩来总理和彭真市长，贺龙、陈毅副总理，李济深、郭沫若副委员长等陪同步入会场走上主席台。这时，乐队高奏欢乐的乐曲，万人起立笑迎贵宾，长时间有节奏地热烈鼓掌，几十名男女少年儿童跑上主席台，把鲜花献给金日成首相，献给朴正爱、南日、金光侠、李一卿和李永镐等同志，献给朝鲜的全体贵宾们。
    朝鲜军事代表团和朝鲜驻中国大使馆的同志们也出席了大会。
    暴风雨般的掌声席卷了全场，金日成首相迎着万张笑脸发表了长篇讲话。当首相以朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府以及朝鲜人民的名义，向全体中国人民衷心地致以热烈的兄弟般的问候的时候，全场掌声雷动，经久不息。
    首相以充满激情的话语颂扬了两国人民的伟大友谊。他说：“朝中两国人民之间有着无产阶级国际主义的友好合作关系。朝中两国人民之间的友谊和团结，是通过历来的长期共同斗争而形成的，并且在革命斗争的烈火中得到巩固和发展。”首相说：“任何力量也破坏不了朝中两国人民的伟大友谊，任何力量也战胜不了我们两国人民的团结力量。”“在朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一和建设社会主义的斗争中，朝中两国人民的友谊和团结是无比珍贵的。我国人民通过殊死的斗争，体验到了同中国人民的友谊和团结的不可战胜的生命力。今后，我们将继续为加强朝中两国人民的传统友谊和互相合作而贡献一切力量。朝鲜人民将永远是和中国人民同甘苦、共患难的战友。”
    首相畅述了飞跃发展的两国社会主义建设事业以后兴奋地说：“今天，我们是在和平与社会主义力量比战争与帝国主义势力占绝对优势的有利的形势下生活着。”“所有的社会主义阵营国家，都在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，以苏联为中心紧紧地团结在一起，空前地加强了社会主义阵营的威力。这是和平和社会主义胜利的最坚定的保障。”
    首相严厉谴责国际反动派及其走狗修正主义者破坏社会主义阵营统一的阴谋活动，指出“历史经验已经证明，在这个世界上，没有任何力量能够破坏社会主义阵营的统一。谁要企图破坏，谁就一定会遭到像过去一样的失败。”
    首相指出：“以美国为首的帝国主义侵略者，不愿正视业已转变的局势，更不愿意从自己所遭到的可耻的失败里吸取应有的教训。”
    “美帝国主义纠合已被人民唾弃的蒋介石、李承晚和吴庭艳等人类垃圾，妄图挽救自己日暮途穷的命运。它还企图复活日本军国主义，把日本变为美国在远东的侵略基地。这一切，简直就等于落到水里还抓住一棵草，企图苟延残喘。”
    首相说：中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜这一措施，“再一次证明了中国人民为促进和平解决朝鲜问题，为缓和远东紧张局势而作的真诚努力。”
    首相又一次强调说：“美国没有任何借口能使它的军队强占南朝鲜合法化，它们应当撤出南朝鲜。”
    首相严厉谴责美帝国主义最近在台湾海峡地区进行的反对中国人民的严重的挑衅。他警告说：“如果美帝国主义不接受自己的侵略政策屡次遭到失败和在朝鲜战争中遭到惨败的教训，不顾中国人民的严重警告和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民以及一切爱好和平人民的痛斥，胆敢扩大自己的挑衅，那末，归根结底，一定会被埋葬掉。”
    首相说：“在反对共同敌人的共同斗争中，同中国人民血肉相连的朝鲜人民，在反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫和平的斗争中，将永远坚定地站在中国人民这一边。”
    金日成首相最后满怀信心地说，朝鲜人民相信自己伟大事业的正确，“我们一定会坚强地捍卫朝鲜的和平防线，并且在为自己祖国和平统一的斗争中，一定会取得最后胜利。”
    金日成首相的每一段话都博得了全场经久不息的热烈掌声。在金日成首相讲话结束以后，周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和彭真市长都同首相热烈握手，感谢他那充满友谊热情的讲话。
    彭真市长在欢迎大会开始时，热情致词欢迎贵宾。
    彭真市长说，中朝两国的友谊是在长期的反对共同敌人的革命斗争中建立和发展起来的，是以马列主义的共同思想为基础的，是永恒的牢不可破的，它的力量是不可战胜的。
    彭真市长盛赞朝鲜人民在社会主义建设事业中取得的巨大成就。他说：“如同在反对美国侵略者的战争中一样，我们把朝鲜人民在和平建设中的每一项成就，看成是自己的成就。我们相信，勤劳勇敢的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党的正确领导下，一定会取得更加伟大、更加辉煌的胜利！”
    彭真市长强调说，我们两国人民都在轰轰烈烈地进行着社会主义建设，但是我们一刻也没有忘记美帝国主义对我们两国的侵略和威胁。“美帝国主义过去是、现在仍然是中朝人民共同的最危险的敌人。中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民和平统一自己祖国的斗争，并且深信朝鲜人民的斗争是一定要胜利的。美帝国主义既不能阻挠中国人民解放台、澎、金、马，也决不能阻挠朝鲜的三千里江山归于统一。美帝国主义在东方可以任意横行霸道的时代已经过去了。它的倒行逆施只会加速自己的死亡。”
    彭真市长最后说，“现在，朝鲜人民在胜利前进，中国人民在胜利前进，以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国都在胜利前进，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族革命运动正在蓬勃发展，世界人民保卫和平的斗争正在继续高涨，在我们的新世界，一切都充满着朝气，一切都在欣欣向荣地发展。”“我们代表着历史发展的潮流，我们代表着人类进步的方向、代表着光明、代表着和平。我们深信光明必将战胜黑暗，进步必将战胜反动，和平必将战胜战争。最后胜利一定属于我们！”
    彭真市长还代表首都人民向金日成首相和朝鲜政府代表团的贵宾们献旗献礼。在献旗献礼的时候，全场再一次起立，热烈鼓掌，向贵宾们表示崇高的敬意。
    今天下午，国家机关各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派、北京市各部门的负责人和中国人民解放军的高级将领，同各界人民一起参加大会热情欢迎贵宾。
    隆重热烈的欢迎大会结束以后，开始了盛大的欢迎演出。志愿军文工团和首都的演员们表演了精采的中、朝两国的歌舞节目。演出结束后，当金日成首相等由周恩来总理等陪同走出体育馆大厅时，全场的人们夹道欢送。这时，为中朝友谊而激起的鼓掌和欢呼的声浪，久久荡漾在体育馆的夜空。（附图片）
