    The Peasants of Wen'an Depression Have Won
    By Our Correspondents Rui Yingjie and Hu Yuquan
    In the past, Wen'an was a hundred li of surging waves;
    Now, Wen'an is a mountain of piled-up rice.
    Agricultural production in the Wen'an Depression (in Wen'an County, Hebei) has made a great leap forward this year. What was once a hundred-li expanse of water has now become a sea of rice. In this basin-like depression, long plagued by floods and mud, nearly 400,000 mu of paddy fields have yielded 247 million jin of rice this year, equivalent to three and a half times the total grain output of the entire county last year. This is a victory for the people of the entire depression in their large-scale offensive against natural disasters, inspired by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction.
            Poverty Breeds Change
    Wen'an Depression is a well-known poverty-stricken and disaster-prone area. Looking back a hundred years, there were only six years without disasters. From the poem recorded in the county annals, "Rivers and lakes flood the land, people flee, only boats can navigate the roads," one can imagine the impoverished lives the people of the depression have lived for many years.
    At the end of last year, based on the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, the county committee planned to expand the paddy field planting area from 70,000 mu to 700,000 mu. The county committee presented the plan to the masses. Before the autumn harvest was even complete, the masses throughout the depression began discussions in conjunction with the achievements of the depression's transformation over the past three years. Three years of practice have made the masses realize that planting more paddy fields is the only way out for the peasants of Wen'an Depression. The plan was set: to build surrounding embankments to achieve segmented management; and to connect the depressions and lakes through sluice gates and canals to ensure that 700,000 mu of paddy fields could be planted.
    In the Days of Ice and Snow
    Last winter, the large-scale depression transformation project in Wen'an Depression began. They had to build hundreds of sluice gates and hundreds of canals of various sizes; on the edge of the depression, they also had to build a hundred-li-long surrounding embankment. This is a pivotal project that secures the overall production situation, like the Great Wall, blocking the drainage from outside the depression and preventing it from flowing into the depression.
    More than 60,000 laborers were mobilized. Everyone was of one mind, working on the surrounding embankment. They camped on the construction site, fighting day and night, working tirelessly through wind and snow. The 26 million cubic meters of earthwork were completed in one winter and one spring. On the sluice gate construction sites, hundreds of large carts and hundreds of boats of various sizes formed dozens of water and land transportation teams. All materials were transported to the construction site, by boat when encountering water and by cart when encountering dry land. More than 1,200 "earth engineers" took on all the technical work of building the sluice gates. Take the Dianzi Gate, which can handle a flow of twenty units, for example. It was designed by a carpenter and a bricklayer. After they finished designing, the masses raised more than 100 cubic meters of stone, more than 300,000 bricks, and 20,000 yuan in funds. From design to construction, it took less than two months.
      When the Drought Demon Was in Charge
    After the project was completed, land preparation and rice seedling cultivation followed. But unexpectedly, Wen'an Depression, which used to be flooded with water, was so dry this year that white smoke rose from the ground. From August last year to July this year, it hardly rained for a whole year. By the Qingming Festival, the Shexing, Dianzi, and Renwen major canals had dropped from twenty units of flow to four units, and even the water supply for 30,000 mu of seedlings was insufficient. During the transplanting season, most of the land lost moisture, and the 400,000 mu of water surface in Wen'an Depression drastically shrank to 100,000 mu. All seven major rivers and 240 main and branch canals in the county were completely dry. The bottom of the Daqing River was so dry that large carts could drive across it.
    Under the leadership of the county committee, 160,000 laborers, accounting for 70% of the county's total population, enthusiastically participated in the anti-drought and rice transplanting campaign.
    They dug 90 water diversion canals with a total length of 700,000 meters from the deep water areas of the depression to the surrounding areas, concentrating 300 water pumps to pump water from the "bottom of the basin" to the edges, then controlled it section by section, balancing the water level. This not only provided water for transplanting in the higher areas along the depression, but also expanded the planting area in the deep water areas due to the lowered water level. In addition, the anti-drought army of the entire depression dug more than 1,100 water storage ponds of various sizes, deepened 110 canals, and dug more than 7,000 wells, effectively solving the difficulty of lacking surface water. The major and minor difficulties brought by the drought demon were all overcome.
    The rice seedlings were transplanted. People praised the power of this collective strength, saying: "The Communist Party's leadership is truly good, everyone in the entire depression has great ideas, yesterday the eastern depression was full of weeds, today we see a sea of rice."
          Rescuing Rice Seedlings in the Flood
    On July 13, a torrential rain suddenly fell, pouring down more than 300 millimeters at once. The surrounding embankment project proved its effectiveness, blocking the drainage from the outside. But within this embankment circle, rainwater rapidly concentrated towards the center of the depression, and the large depression rose more than a foot in an instant. The rice seedlings that had just been transplanted after fighting the drought were about to be swallowed up.
    Some people despaired in the face of this sudden attack. At this time, if more people hesitated even slightly, it would bring significant losses to the hard-won labor results. At this critical juncture, the brave people, without hesitation, under the leadership of the county committee, turned to a serious struggle against the waterlogging disaster.
    Before the rain even stopped, the county secretary, county head, and many county and township cadres went down to the depression. They waded through the water, braving the wind and rain, sitting in small boats, observing the water situation. They decided to divide the water flow. The people of the entire depression put down the half-dug water storage ponds, put down the untransplanted seedlings, issued an "all-out" mobilization order, concentrated their strength, and rushed to build water-separating embankments along the edge of the depression overnight. They used water-separating embankments to separate the depression from the high ground, and the deep water from the shallow water. Overnight, they wove a "embankment network" including more than 30 embankments of various sizes, with a total length of more than 4,100 meters, on this hundreds of thousands of mu of land. The drainage stopped flowing, it was divided by these heroic people in one night.
    Following this, all the 3,000-plus horsepower of drainage and irrigation machinery in the county were concentrated, and people used water scoops, basins, and all usable furniture, non-stop day and night, to drain the accumulated water into the pre-determined water storage area in the center of the depression. For ten days and nights, the deep water became shallow, and the rice fields submerged by the water re-emerged.
    The Fragrance of Rice in Every Household
    In the face of the heroic people, Wen'an Depression was conquered. It obediently yielded its abundant fruits. This year, the nearly 400,000 mu of paddy fields harvested (accounting for 34% of the county's total cultivated land) yielded a total of 247 million jin of rice, with an average yield of 618 jin per mu, an increase of nearly ten times compared to last year's total rice output. Due to the bumper harvest in the large depression, the county unprecedentedly sold 150 million jin of surplus grain to the state.
    Sijicheng Village is located in the center of the large depression, and in the past, they ate wild vegetables and groundnuts. This year, they "leaped to the sky," harvesting 3.1 million jin of rice for the whole village, averaging 30,000 jin per household. Huangdianzhuang only planted six and a half mu of rice last year, and the whole year's food relied on the state. This year, they planted 1,035 mu, with a total output of more than 820,000 jin. If this rice is milled into rice, the bran alone can be sold for 4,920 yuan, equivalent to twice the total grain output of the entire village last year!
    The unprecedented bumper harvest of rice has completely changed the living conditions and spiritual outlook of the people of Wen'an Depression. From October, the people's communes in the depression no longer charged for meals. On October 1st, commune members all beat gongs and drums, held meetings to celebrate, and men, women, old and young, were all smiles.
    This year's great agricultural harvest has not only ended the impoverished state of "eating from a hundred families" in the history of Wen'an Depression, but also brought people the spiritual and material strength to strive for a greater leap forward next year. In order to further thoroughly transform Wen'an Depression, the permanent water conservancy project—expanding the surrounding embankment—began on October 20. 10,000 laborers are camping near the depression and water area, braving the cold wind of early winter, working day and night to ensure a greater harvest on the 400,000 mu of paddy fields in the large depression next year.

    文安洼农民胜利了
    本报记者　芮英杰　胡玉泉
    过去看文安，百里浪涛天；
    如今看文安，稻谷堆成山。
    文安洼（在河北文安县）的农业生产今年是一个大飞跃。方圆百多里的一片水，如今变成了稻海。就在这个洪水、泥水长期滞留的盆底洼里，今年近四十万亩稻田产了二亿四千七百万斤稻谷，等于去年全县粮食总产量的三倍半。这是全洼人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，向自然灾害大举进攻的胜利。
            穷则思变
    文安洼是个远近知名的贫困多灾地方。往前追索一百年，只有六年未受灾。从县志上记载的“江湖满地流亡尽，唯有扁舟渡路人”的诗句里，可以想见洼里人民多少年来过的贫困生活。
    去年年底，县委根据农业生产大跃进的形势，计划把稻田种植面积由七万亩扩大到七十万亩。县委把计划交给了群众。秋收还没完，全洼群众就结合三年来的洼改成绩开展了讨论。三年的实践，使群众认识到，多种稻田是文安洼农民唯一的出路。计划订下来了：要搭筑周边埝，实现分割治理；通过闸涵、渠道，使洼淀沟通，保证种上七十万亩稻田。
    在冰封的日子里
    去年冬天，文安洼大规模的洼地改造工程开始了。他们要修建起几百座闸涵和几百条大小渠道；在洼边，还要筑起一条百里周边大埝。这是一项固定生产大局的枢纽工程，它好像万里长城一样挡住洼外沥水，堵死它流到洼里的老路。
    六万多民工出动了，所有的人，万众一心，在周边埝上施工。他们在工地宿营，日夜鏖战，风雪不停工，二千六百万公方土的工程，一冬一春就完成了。在修闸涵的工地上，几百辆大车和几百条大小船只，组成了几十支水旱运输大队。所有的物料，遇水上船，逢旱上车，源源运往工地。一千二百多个土工程师把修建闸涵的技术活全部担当了起来。就说能过二十个流量的店子闸吧，那是一个木匠和一个瓦匠设计的。他们设计完了，群众把一百多方石头、三十多万块砖和两万元资金也筹集齐了。连设计、带施工，共总不到两个月。
      旱魔当头的时候
    工程做完了，紧接着整地，育秧。但万万没有想到往年积水的文安洼，今年竟旱得满地冒白烟。从去年8月到今年7月，几乎整整一年没下雨。到了清明节，舍兴、店子、任文等三个大干渠由二十个流量降到四个流量，连供给三万亩秧苗的水也不足了。等到插秧期间，土地大部失墒，文安洼四十万亩的积水面急剧地缩小到十万亩，全县大小七道河流和二百四十条干、支渠道全部干枯；那大清河底，干得走了大车。
    在县委的领导下，占全县总人口70％的十六万劳动大军踊跃地投入到抗旱插秧运动中来了。
    他们从洼底深水处往四外开挖出全长七十万公尺的九十条引水渠道，把三百台抽水机集中起来，把水从“盆底”抽向盆沿，然后节节控制，平衡了水势。这不但使洼边高地有了水插秧，洼底深水也因水位降低而扩大了种植面积。此外，全洼抗旱大军还打了一千一百多个大小水柜，深挖渠道一百一十条，打井七千多眼，有效地解决了缺少地上水的困难。旱魔所带来的大大小小的困难都被克服了。
    稻秧插下去了。人们歌颂这种集体力量的威力说：共产党领导真是好，全洼人人办法高，昨天东洼遍地草，今天再看一片稻。”
          洪水里抢救稻秧
    7月13日忽然下了一场倾盆雨，一气下了三百多公厘。周边埝工程发挥效益了，它挡住了外围沥水。但是就在这埝圈里，雨水急剧地向洼心集中，顿时大洼涨水一尺以上。刚刚抗旱插上的秧苗，眼看着就要被吞没了。
    有些人在这突如其来的袭击面前绝望了。这时如果更多的人稍一迟疑，就会给这千辛万苦的劳动成果带来重大损失，勇敢的人们在这紧要关头，毫不迟疑地在县委领导下转入了向水涝灾害的严重斗争。
    雨还没停止，县委书记、县长和许多县、乡干部就下洼了。他们趟着水，冒着风雨，坐着小船，观察水势。他们决定分割水势。全洼的人民放下了挖了半截的水柜，放下了没有插完的秧，发出了“倾国之兵”，集中力量，在洼边连夜抢搭隔水埝。他们用隔水埝把洼地和高地分开，把深水和浅水分开。一夜之间，就在这几十万亩的土地上织成了一个包括三十多条大小围埝、总长达四千一百多公尺的“埝网”。沥水停止径流了，它们被这英雄的人们在一夜里分割开来。
    跟着全县所有的三千多马力的排灌机械集中起来，人们把水斗子、脸盆、一切可以使用的家具，昼夜不停地把积水排入洼心预定的积水区。整整十个昼夜，深水变浅了，被水淹没的稻田又重新露出水面。
    千家万户稻米香
    在英雄的人民面前，文安洼被征服了。它乖乖地交出了丰硕的果实。今年收获的近四十万亩稻田（占全县总耕地34％）共收获稻谷二亿四千七百万斤，平均亩产六百一十八斤，比去年稻谷总产量增加近十倍。由于大洼丰收，全县破天荒卖给国家一亿五千万斤余粮。
    司吉城村在大洼中心，过去吃苦菜、地梨。今年他们“一步登天”了，全村收了三百一十万斤稻谷，平均一户三万斤。黄淀庄去年只种了六亩半水稻，全年吃粮靠国家。今年呢，种了一千零三十五亩，总产八十二万多斤。如果把这些稻谷碾成米，光糠就能卖四千九百二十元，抵上去年全村粮食总产量的两倍！
    水稻的空前丰收，彻底改变了文安洼人民的生活状况和精神面貌。从10月份起，洼里的各个人民公社就吃饭不要钱了。10月1日那天，公社社员们都敲锣打鼓，开会庆贺，男女老少喜笑颜开。
    今年的农业大丰收，不仅结束了文安洼历史上“吃百家饭”的贫困面貌，同时给人们带来了为争取明年更大跃进的精神力量与物质力量。为了进一步彻底改造文安洼，永久性的水利工程——扩大周边埝，已于10月20日开始了，一万名民工傍洼近水地区扎营，正冒着初冬的寒风，昼夜施工，保证明年在大洼四十万亩稻田获得更大的丰收。
