Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 28th. The Soviet Union's note on the abolition of the occupied status of Berlin has aroused great interest among West German politicians. According to the German News Agency: "Political figures believe that the unexpected aspect of the note is the proposal to hold negotiations—albeit with a time limit—rather than a unilateral declaration to immediately abolish the four-power occupation status of Berlin."

West German government spokesman Eckardt pointed out at a press conference in Bonn on the 27th that the Soviet proposal to hold negotiations with the three Western powers on the abolition of the occupied status of Berlin "is legally unobjectionable." But he also said that the Soviet proposal for negotiations had some restrictions, which "reduced its value."

Eckardt also said that the Soviet proposal for negotiations was "a relief," but the deadline for this proposal was "too serious." The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Federal Parliament has decided to hold a special meeting on the 28th to discuss the Soviet note.

    西德政府发言人承认
    苏联建议无可非议
    但又认为日期限制是“太严重了”
    新华社28日讯　波恩消息：苏联关于取消柏林的被占领地位的照会引起西德政界人士的很大兴趣。据德意志新闻社报道：“政界人士认为，照会中出乎意料的地方是建议举行谈判——虽然是有时间限制的谈判——而不是声明单方面立即取消柏林的四国占领状态”。
    西德政府发言人埃卡特27日在波恩的记者招待会上指出，苏联关于同西方三国举行关于取消柏林被占领地位的谈判，这一建议从法律观点来说“是无可非议的”。但是他又说，苏联关于谈判的建议有一些限制，这“减少了它的价值”。
    埃卡特还说，苏联提出的关于谈判的建议“令人松了一口气”，可是这一建议在日期上的限制是“太严重了”。联邦议院外交委员会已决定在28日举行特别会议，讨论苏联的照会。
