    Huangcai Commune Establishes Cattle Raising Team
    Intensifies Care to Help Draft Cattle Overwinter
    (Our dispatch) After the communization of the Shengxi Production Team of the Shengxi Brigade in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province's Huangcai Commune, due to the large-scale battles of industrial and agricultural production, leadership over draft cattle work was neglected, and a "three-nobody-cares" phenomenon emerged (small cooperative neglecting, herders neglecting, and large commune also neglecting). Some herders even thought, "After the establishment of the commune, mechanization will happen soon, and draft cattle will be useless." As a result, ten of the team's twenty-five draft cattle lost weight. After discovering this situation, the Party General Branch immediately convened a meeting of cattle management personnel and the livestock committee, presented many facts to illustrate that mechanization could not be achieved immediately, and that draft cattle would remain the main power in rural areas for a considerable period. They refuted the statement that "draft cattle are useless" and unanimously agreed that it was necessary to strengthen draft cattle care.
    Based on the opinions of the commune members, the brigade established a cattle raising team, led by the deputy captain of the production team, and selected nine skilled cattle raisers as herders. They launched a management campaign of "four fixings" (fixing people, fixing tasks, fixing fatness, fixing feed) and "five comparisons" (comparing clean troughs and full bellies, comparing diligent grazing, comparing thoughtful care, comparing epidemic prevention and hygiene, comparing non-empty pregnancies for cows) to keep each draft cattle strong and full of fat. They also prepared sufficient winter feed for the draft cattle, with an average of more than 5,000 jin of concentrated and dry feed per head, and 50 to 80 jin of green feed per day. The herders also formulated winter grazing and feeding plans. Their slogan is: "Don't let a single draft cattle lose an ounce of fat overwinter."

    黄材公社成立养牛专业队
    加意护理耕牛过冬
    本报讯　湖南宁乡县黄材公社胜溪大队胜溪生产队，在公社化以后，由于忙着工农业生产的大兵团作战，忽视了对耕牛工作的领导，曾出现了“三不管”（小社不管、饲养员不管、大社也不管）的现象。有的饲养员还认为“成立公社以后很快就要机械化了，耕牛没有作用了。”致使全队二十五头耕牛中有十头瘦了一成膘。党总支发现这个情况后，立即召开耕牛管理人员和牧畜委员会进行了研究，并摆出很多事实，说明机械化还不是马上能办到的，在相当长时期内，耕牛仍然是农村主要动力，驳倒了“耕牛没有作用”的说法，一致认为目前必须加强耕牛护理工作。
    根据社员意见，大队成立了养牛专业队，由生产队副队长领导，选择了九个养牛能手为饲养员。并开展“四定”（定人、定任务、定膘、定饲料）“五比”（比栏干食饱、比勤快放牧、比照顾周到、比防疫卫生、比母牛不空怀）的管理运动，使每头耕牛保持体壮满膘。他们还为耕牛准备了充足的过冬饲料，平均每头牛有精饲料和干饲料五千多斤，每天还可吃到五十斤到八十斤青饲料。饲养员们还订出了冬季放牧、喂料计划。他们的口号是：“不让一头耕牛过冬退一分膘。”
