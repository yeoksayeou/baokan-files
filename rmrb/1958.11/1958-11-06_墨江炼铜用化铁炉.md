Xinhua News Agency, Kunming – Mojiang County, Yunnan Province, is experimenting with using iron smelting furnaces, originally used by the people to cast plowshares, to smelt copper. The process is fast and effective. Anyone can master the complete furnace construction and smelting techniques in just two hours.

This method was successfully tested by the First Secretary of the Mojiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and a master craftsman from the Tongguan Township farm tool factory who cast plowshares. For each furnace load, they add three kilograms of ore and four kilograms of charcoal, and copper can be produced in fifteen minutes. A small earthen furnace can produce approximately 20 to 40 kilograms of copper per day.

The characteristics of this furnace are: strong wind, small furnace, high temperature, small but frequent additions of material, and fast production. The County Committee believes it has three major advantages: (1) Simple operation, making the technology easy for the masses to grasp. As long as there is ore, anyone can smelt copper; (2) Low investment and quick results. The cost of a furnace is approximately four yuan, it can be built in two hours, and it has a lifespan of over a month, producing at least half a ton of copper; (3) Easy to transport. Smelt wherever there is ore, and if there is no ore, one person can carry it away. The factory is wherever the person goes. It can be smelted at home or on the mountain.

The Mojiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has held an on-site meeting in Tongguan Township to vigorously promote this copper smelting method. All sixty Party branch secretaries in the county learned the furnace construction and smelting techniques in just one and a half hours. After returning, they all produced copper. They are now widely disseminating the technology to the masses using the method of "one teaches ten, ten teaches a hundred."

    墨江炼铜用化铁炉
    新华社昆明电　云南省墨江县试用民间铸犁铧的化铁炉炼铜，又快又好，每人学两小时，就可以掌握建炉和冶炼的全套技术。
    这种方法是中共墨江县委第一书记和通关乡农具厂的一位铸犁铧的老师傅共同试验成功的。他们每炉加矿石三公斤、木炭四公斤，十五分钟就可出铜。一个小土炉一天约可出铜二十至四十公斤。
    这种炉子的特点是：风大炉小温度高，少吃多餐出产快。县委认为它有三大优点：（一）操作简单，群众容易掌握技术，只要有矿，人人可以炼铜；（二）投资少，见效快，一个炉子造价约四元，两小时建成，寿命一月以上，至少可产铜半吨；（三）携带方便，有矿就炼，无矿一人挑起就走，人到那里厂在那里，可以在家里炼，也可以在山上炼。
    中共墨江县委已在通关乡开了现场会议，大力推广这种炼铜法。全县六十个党总支书记，只用一个半小时就全部学会了建炉、冶炼技术，回去以后都炼出铜来。他们正在用一传十、十传百的办法向群众广泛传授技术。
