    Beijing and Shaanxi Prioritize Basic Construction Projects by Importance, with Emphasis on Both Important and Less Important Aspects
    (Our Newspaper Reporter Zhou Dingfang Reports) Under the conditions of insufficient construction materials and a labor shortage, Beijing, when arranging its industrial basic construction plan for the fourth quarter of this year and next year, adopted the method of arranging more and tighter engineering projects that need to be built, striving for the early production of newly built industries.
    This year, the area of Beijing's industrial construction reached 2.66 million square meters, a six-fold increase compared to last year. From January to September, 800,000 square meters have been completed, and another 1.74 million square meters of engineering projects must be started or completed in the fourth quarter. If calculated according to the major construction materials allocated uniformly by the state, it can only meet the needs of 700,000 square meters of engineering at most. Based on this situation, the Industrial Basic Construction Office of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly summarized the construction experience of the first nine months and found that under the conditions of scarce materials and equipment and a labor shortage, arranging more and tighter engineering projects that need to be built has two major advantages: First, it can give full play to the enthusiasm of all parties and tap potential. Second, it greatly accelerates the speed of construction. For example, in August and September, many construction companies felt that materials were insufficient. Because the masses were mobilized to find solutions, and factories were established from scratch to produce construction materials when materials were insufficient, as a result, without increasing materials and manpower, 1.89 million square meters of projects were completed, which is more than one-third more than the total amount completed in the first seven months of this year.
    Based on this construction experience, the Industrial Basic Construction Office of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China consciously arranged twice as many engineering projects as materials. The main measures they took were: under the condition of ensuring key projects, the entire project was uniformly ranked, and batches were launched in order to improve the finished product rate of basic construction.
    The order of Beijing's industrial basic construction projects arranged for this winter is:
      (1) Focusing on marshals, pioneers, and cutting-edge industries, a group of key projects has been determined. Among these key projects, the main factory buildings are the focus, and batches are launched to build and produce simultaneously, as quickly as possible, to put them into production.
      (2) Distinguishing between important and less important projects, but also taking into account the important within the less important, and the less important within the important. For example, the more than 2,000 square meter office of the special steel plant, the living quarters of the small and medium-sized motor factory, etc., have been decided to be postponed to later.
      (3) Attaching importance to finishing work, and taking care of general projects. Efforts are made to complete and put into use 200,000 square meters of finishing work and projects that are about to be completed in the short term.
      (4) While arranging the metallurgical industry, attention is paid to arranging engineering projects that cooperate with it. For example, coke, refractory materials, transportation equipment, etc.
    The arrangement of basic construction is not a purely technical issue, but a sharp ideological struggle. In the process of arrangement, there will inevitably be a situation where there must be a priority and a later, a light and a heavy, and a gain and a loss. Before the arrangement, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted full ideological education among the relevant cadres, repeatedly emphasizing the overall viewpoint, criticizing departmentalism, opposing emotional considerations, and advocating a communist style.
    (Our Newspaper Xi'an 14th Dispatch) The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently, based on the spirit of centralized leadership, comprehensive collaboration, and ensuring key points, arranged basic construction projects, concentrating construction materials, construction machinery, etc. on key projects, ensuring that key projects are completed on schedule or ahead of schedule, and accelerating the speed of construction.
    Shaanxi Province's basic construction plan for the first three quarters was not completed well. By the end of September, only 40% of this year's Great Leap Forward plan had been completed. The Provincial Committee believes that the reason why the basic construction plan was not completed well is that, in addition to the late determination of the plan, many changes, and the failure to supply materials, the main reason is that the relevant departments did not seriously arrange the basic construction projects and ignored the principle of concentrating the use of materials and ensuring key projects. In the past few arrangements, no sharp ideological struggle was carried out against the departmentalism and local viewpoints of some cadres, so the arrangement was inaccurate. This is first manifested in the fact that the principle of taking into account the important within the less important, and the less important within the important, was not taken into account during the arrangement. All buildings in key projects were regarded as key points, but some key projects in non-key projects were not included. Therefore, some key projects could not be completed on schedule due to insufficient materials, while some secondary buildings were quickly completed. For example, a key construction project undertaken by the Third Engineering Zone of the First Company of Shaanxi Province, because all buildings were regarded as key projects during the arrangement, the construction unit used the materials that arrived first to construct more than 60,000 square meters of mixed-structure employee dormitories, but not a single of the most important factory buildings was built.
    In order to reverse the slow progress of basic construction, the Provincial Committee and relevant departments recently made specific arrangements for basic construction projects based on the spirit of centralized leadership and ensuring key points. During the arrangement, they criticized the departmentalism of some units that emphasized the importance of their own projects, regardless of other key projects, and the erroneous practices of some construction units that used inventory materials for non-key projects in order to complete more workload. Special emphasis was placed on promoting the communist spirit. This arrangement made specific arrangements for the key projects and construction progress of each project. The "marshals" and "pioneers" were ranked at the forefront, but only the main production workshops were listed as key points. For example, the construction of the Baoji Steel Pipe Plant focused on the four main factory buildings such as the seamless steel pipe workshop, while other projects were listed as non-key projects. However, key workshops in non-key industries and the "missing links" in the national scope were also included in the key projects. At the same time, it was decided to construct these key projects in several batches, launching an assault on one batch and then another, so that it would be easier to concentrate the use of construction materials and construction forces, and to promote advanced experience in rapid construction and accelerate the speed of construction.
    Currently, the construction units and construction departments in Shaanxi Province have taken active action according to the arrangements of the Provincial Committee. (Attached picture)

### 缩短战线　抓住重点　分批上马　分批突击  北京、陕西分别轻重对基本建设项目进行排队重中有轻轻中有重

    缩短战线　抓住重点　分批上马　分批突击
    北京、陕西分别轻重对基本建设项目进行排队重中有轻轻中有重
    本报讯　记者周定舫报道：在建筑材料不足、劳动力缺乏的条件下，北京市在安排今年第四季度和明年的工业基本建设计划的时候，采取了把需要兴建的工程项目，排得多一些、紧一些的方法，力争新建工业早日投入生产。
    今年，北京工业建设的面积达二百六十六万平方公尺，比去年增加了六倍。从1月到9月，已经竣工的有八十万平方公尺，其中还有一百七十四万平方公尺的工程项目都要挤在第四季度开工或竣工。如果按照国家统一分配的主要建筑材料，最多只能满足七十万平方公尺工程的需要。中共北京市委工业基建办公室根据这种情况，及时总结了前九个月的建设经验，发现在材料设备少、劳动力不足的条件下，把需要建设的工程项目排得多一些，紧一些，有两大好处：第一，可以充分发挥各方面的积极性，挖掘潜力。第二，促使建设的速度大大加快。例如，在8、9两个月内，许多建筑企业都感到材料不够。由于放手发动群众想办法，材料不够的白手起家办工厂生产建筑材料，结果，没有增加材料和人力，完成了一百八十九万平方公尺的工程，比今年前七个月完工的总量还多三分之一以上。
    中共北京市委工业基建办公室根据这个建设经验，有意识地安排了比材料还多一倍的工程项目。他们采取的主要措施是：在保证重点工程的条件下，对全部工程进行统一排队，分批突击，来提高基本建设的成品率。
    北京市安排今冬工业基本建设项目的顺序是：
      （1）以元帅、先行和尖端工业为中心，确定了一批重点工程。在这些重点工程中，又以主要厂房为主，分批突击，边建边产，尽快地投入生产。
      （2）分别轻重，但又照顾轻中有重，重中有轻。例如，特殊钢厂二千多平方公尺的办公室，中小型电机厂的生活间等都决定缓到以后再建。
      （3）重视收尾工程，照顾一般。对二十万平方公尺的收尾工程和快完工的工程，争取在短期内都陆续完工，交付使用。
      （4）在安排冶金工业的同时，注意安排了和它相配合的工程项目。例如焦炭、耐火材料、运输设备等等。
    基本建设的排队，不是单纯的技术问题，而是一场尖锐的思想斗争。在排队过程中，必然会出现有先必有后，有轻必有重，有得必有失的局面。中共北京市委在排队前，在有关的干部中作了充分的思想教育，再三地强调全面观点，批判本位主义，反对照顾情绪，提倡共产主义风格。
    本报西安14日电　中共陕西省委最近根据集中领导，全面协作，确保重点的精神，对基本建设工程进行了排队，将建筑材料、施工机械等集中用到重点工程上去，保证重点工程按期或提前建成，加快建设速度。
    陕西省前三个季度的基本建设计划完成得不够好，到9月底只完成今年跃进计划40％。省委认为基建计划完成不好的原因，除了计划确定迟，变动多和材料供应不上以外，主要是有关部门对基建项目没有认真地进行排队，忽视了集中使用材料、确保重点工程的原则。过去几次排队中对某些干部的本位主义思想和局部观点没有开展尖锐的思想斗争，因此，排得不准。这首先表现在排队时没有照顾到轻中有重，重中有轻的原则，把重点工程中所有建筑都当成了重点，而把某些非重点工程的重点项目却没有排进去。因此，有些重点项目因材料不足不能按期竣工，而某些次要建筑却很快建成了。例如陕西省一公司三工区承担的一项重点建设，由于排队时把所有建筑都当成重点项目，施工单位将先到场的材料建设了六万多平方公尺混合结构的职工宿舍，而最主要的厂房却一个也没有建成。
    为了扭转基本建设进度迟缓现象，最近省委和有关部门根据集中领导确保重点的精神对基本建设工程进行了具体安排，在排队过程中批判了某些单位强调本单位工程重要，不顾其他重点工程的本位主义思想，和某些施工单位为了多完成些工作量，把库存材料用到非重点工程上去的错误作法。特别强调发扬共产主义精神。这次排队对每一个工程中的重点项目和建设进度都作了具体安排，排在最前面的是“元帅”和“先行”，但只是把主要的生产厂房列入重点，例如宝鸡钢管厂的建设就是把无缝钢管车间等四个主厂房列入重点，其他项目列入非重点工程。而对非重点行业中的重点车间和全国范围的“缺门”也列入重点项目内。同时，决定将这些重点项目分几批进行建设，突击完一批再突击一批，这样，既便于集中使用建筑材料和施工力量，又便于推广快速施工的先进经验，加快建设速度。
    目前，陕西省的建筑单位和施工部门已经根据省委的安排积极行动起来了。（附图片）
