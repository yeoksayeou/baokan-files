　　Breaking Through the Traditional Concept of Labor Requiring Remuneration

　　"Liberation" magazine's ninth issue published an article titled "Greatly Promote a Communist Attitude Toward Labor." The article stated: The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production is, in fact, also a great leap forward in the communist ideology of the broad masses of working people in our country. The most prominent manifestation is that they are increasingly treating labor with a communist spirit. The workers of Shanghai, like the workers in other parts of the country, are treating labor with a new, lofty communist spirit, which is a conscious, selfless, and unremunerated attitude toward labor.

　　Some people find the selfless and unremunerated attitude toward labor of the working class in our country incomprehensible. The solemn fact is that in many factories in Shanghai, after the piece-rate wage system was abolished, production not only did not decline but increased several times over. This proves that the so-called "material incentive theory" is not as sacred and inviolable as some might think. Why do some of our comrades cling to the "material incentive theory" or the "material interest principle"? Because they always like to look at things and people with old eyes. The world has changed, but they always feel that it cannot change much. They do not see that the liberated workers are the masters of the country, and they do not see that the improvement of the workers' communist consciousness has become one of the characteristics of our era.

　　Planning for the long term, working for ideals, and not working for a few dollars, is precisely the symbol of the working class liberating itself from the influence of bourgeois legal ideology. They have broken through the traditional notion of viewing personal or family food and clothing as merely private matters. People are the most important factor in the productive forces. If people's thinking changes, how can it not greatly affect the development of the productive forces? Therefore, the view that only talks about economic interests, does not talk about politics taking command, only sees things, does not see people, and even less sees the increasing communist consciousness of the liberated working class, is not true Marxism, but merely a vulgar materialism.

　　At present, the voluntary labor and communist attitude toward labor that are constantly emerging among the broad masses of working people are living examples for us to carry out communist ideological education. Aren't we going to talk a lot about communist morality? Labor is not for oneself, labor does not count how much money one gets, and even if given money, one does not want it. Isn't this the highest communist morality? To only labor when there is money is too insignificant! Let us raise the great red flag of communism even higher, vigorously sing the praises of, and promote the new communist attitude toward labor among our workers and peasants.

　　The Beginning of Consciously Transforming Oneself and Transforming the World

　　"New Construction" issue number eleven published an article "Advance Holding High the Red Flag of Communist Labor." After describing how voluntary labor has already formed a mass upsurge throughout the country, the author said: This kind of voluntary labor is essentially a kind of communist voluntary labor. People participate in voluntary labor not for personal gain, but for the public interest of society; not for wages, but for the collective welfare of society. This kind of labor is not driven by material incentives, but by the encouragement of collectivist spirit and communist spirit. The author went on to say: In the socialist stage, because it has just broken away from capitalist society, the influence of bourgeois legal ideology in society is still very deep. In order to adapt to the production level and people's ideological level in the socialist stage, it is necessary to implement the principle of "distribution according to labor." Under such circumstances, how can we mobilize people's labor enthusiasm? Experience has proved that we cannot blindly believe in material incentives, but must strengthen communist ideological education among the people. People participate in voluntary labor because they consciously realize that it is for everyone and for the future happiness of mankind. In labor, they can consciously abide by labor discipline and do everything possible to improve labor productivity. From this, we can see how noble actions and how great material strength will be generated once communist ideology is grasped by the masses.

　　When discussing the political significance of participating in voluntary labor, the author pointed out: Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "When the world reaches the point where all mankind consciously transforms themselves and transforms the world, that will be the communist era of the world." Voluntary labor is a beginning for people to consciously transform themselves and transform the world. The author believes that participating in voluntary labor can not only break the age-old decadent concept of despising labor, and not only change social customs, but also be the best way to eradicate individualistic thinking, because in the face of the socialist construction and communist construction of the motherland, the individual appears so small. In the face of the labor force of 600 million people, the individual's role appears so insignificant. In the face of the nationwide upsurge of communist spirit, haggling over personal interests appears so shameful. Labor enthusiasm washes away individualistic thoughts without a trace. The author pointed out: Voluntary labor marks a fundamental change in our society's way of life, ideology, and moral habits, and marks the appearance of a communist spiritual outlook in our lives. This is a necessary spiritual condition for us to transition to a communist society.

    冲破劳动要报酬的传统观念
    “解放”杂志第九期发表了一篇题为“大大提倡共产主义的劳动态度”的文章。文章说：工农业生产的大跃进，实际上也是我国广大劳动人民共产主义思想的大跃进。最突出的表现，就是他们愈来愈用共产主义精神来对待劳动。上海的工人也同全国其他地区的工人一样，正在以一种新的崇高的共产主义精神来对待劳动，这就是自觉的忘我的不计报酬的劳动态度。
    有一些人觉得，我国工人阶级这种忘我的不计报酬的劳动态度是不能理解的。严肃的事实就是这样：上海的许多工厂在取消了计件工资以后，生产不但不下降，反而翻了几番。证明所谓“物质刺激论”并不是那么神圣不可侵犯的。为什么我们有些同志念念不忘那个“物质刺激论”或者叫做“物质利益原则”呢？因为他们总喜欢用老眼光来看事看人。世界变了，他们总觉得变也变不到哪里。他们看不到解放了的工人是国家的主人，看不到工人的共产主义觉悟的提高，已经构成我们时代的特征之一。
    从长远打算，为理想而工作，不是为几个钱而工作，正是工人阶级从资产阶级法权思想影响下解放了自己的标志。他们冲破了把个人或一家的衣食，只看成私人的事情的传统观念。人是生产力最重要的因素，人的思想变了，怎么会不大大影响生产力的发展呢？因此，那种只讲经济利益，不讲政治挂帅，只见物，不见人，更不见解放了的工人阶级日益增长的共产主义觉悟的观点，其实并不是真的马克思主义，只不过是一种庸俗的唯物论。
    目前，在广大劳动人民中间不断涌现的义务劳动和他们的共产主义的劳动态度，是我们进行共产主义思想教育的活榜样。我们不是要大讲共产主义道德么？劳动不是为了自己，劳动不计钱多钱少，甚至给钱也不要，这不就是最高尚的共产主义道德？有钱才劳动，岂不渺小得很！让我们更高地举起共产主义的大红旗，大力歌颂和推动我们工人和农民中的新的共产主义劳动态度。
    自觉地改造自己和改造世界的开端
    “新建设”第十一期刊登了“高举共产主义劳动的红旗前进”的文章。作者叙述了义务劳动已经在全国形成群众性的热潮之后说：这种义务劳动，实质上是一种共产主义的义务劳动。人们参加义务劳动不是为了个人利益，而是为了社会的公共利益，不是为了工资报酬，而是为了社会的集体福利。这种劳动不是由于物质利益的刺激，而是由于集体主义精神和共产主义精神的鼓舞。作者接着说：在社会主义阶段，由于刚从资本主义社会脱离开来，所以资产阶级的法权思想，在社会中的影响还是很深的。为了适应社会主义阶段的生产水平和人们的思想水平，必须实行“按劳分配”的原则。在这种情况下，我们要怎样才能动员人们的劳动自觉性呢？经验证明，不能迷信物质利益的刺激，而必须加强对人们的共产主义思想教育，人们参加义务劳动，就是自觉地意识到是为了大家，为了人类未来的幸福。在劳动中就能自觉地遵守劳动纪律，千方百计的提高劳动生产率。从这里，我们可以看出，共产主义思想一掌握了群众，就将产生多么高尚的行动，产生多么巨大的物质力量。
    作者在谈到参加义务劳动的政治意义时指出：毛泽东同志曾经说：“世界到了全人类都自觉地改造自己和改造世界的时候，那就是世界的共产主义时代。”义务劳动就是人们自觉地改造自己和改造世界的一个开端。作者认为参加义务劳动，不仅可以打破几千年来轻视劳动的陈腐观念，不仅可以改变社会风尚。而且还是根治个人主义思想的最好办法，因为面对着祖国的社会主义建设和共产主义建设，个人显得多么渺小。面对着六亿人民的劳动队伍，个人作用显得多么微不足道。面对着全国的共产主义精神的昂扬，斤斤计较个人利益，显得多么可耻。劳动热情把个人主义思想冲得无影无踪。作者指出：义务劳动标志着我们社会的生活方式、思想意识、道德习惯的根本改变，标志着共产主义的精神面貌已经在我们生活中出现了。这是我们过渡到共产主义社会必备的精神条件。
