    Mobilizing the Masses to Solve Problems
    The Liujiaping Mess Hall Gets Better and Better
    (Our report) The members of the Liujiaping Production Brigade of the Satellite People's Commune in Tunchang County, Shanxi Province, praise their collective mess hall in this rhyme: "The mess hall life is greatly improved, loved by men, women, young and old. We don't eat the same food for seven days, it's even better than being at home." This mess hall is run exceptionally well, satisfying everyone and welcomed by all.
    At the beginning of the Liujiaping mess hall, the brigade leaders were afraid that the commune members would eat grain beyond the standard, so they stipulated that rice be served by portions, and food was distributed equally. As a result, some could not eat enough, while others could not finish. The order in the dining hall was not good, and there was crowding in the queues. It took at least two hours to eat each meal. The commune members were full of discussion. Seeing this phenomenon, the Party Branch Secretary, Liu Dengyun, convened a meeting of commune members to study it. Sure enough, the problem was solved. The commune members vacated a courtyard as a dining hall, each household brought their own tables and stools, and one person per table took turns to serve the food; at the same time, the method of limited allocation was abolished. In this way, not only did the order in the dining hall improve, but also the grain did not exceed the quota.
    After solving the problem of eating enough, it was discovered that the variety of food was too monotonous and could not meet everyone's needs: vegetarians could not eat meat, the elderly could not chew baked cornbread, and the sick and women in confinement liked to eat porridge. In response to this situation, the Party Branch mobilized the cooks to carry out a competition of making fine food from coarse grains, which quickly increased the variety of food. For breakfast, there were seven kinds such as cornmeal dumplings, red flour cornbread, millet porridge, cornmeal paste, and yam porridge. There were more varieties for lunch, including eleven kinds such as cornmeal buns, dumplings, Shandong pancakes, cornmeal noodles, noodles, "gold-wrapped silver", and "silver-wrapped gold". There were also five or six kinds for dinner, such as "hezi" rice, soybean and rice soup, and mung bean porridge. There were even more varieties of vegetables, cooked deliciously, and the commune members ate more and more deliciously. Everyone was happy in the dining hall.
    After eating enough and eating well, a new problem arose: because the cooking utensils were clumsy, meals could not be served on time, affecting labor time. What to do? The Party Branch still mobilized the masses to solve it. Thus, a rationalization proposal campaign to reform cooking utensils was launched. The cooks proposed to change the bellows to a native blower, and the cleaver to a vegetable cutting machine. The Party Branch immediately organized iron and carpenters to make them. After three days of hard work, they successfully trial-produced five kinds of cooking utensils such as foot-operated blowers and vegetable cutting machines. Each tool had low cost, high efficiency, convenient operation, saving people and time. Originally, the mess hall used eight people to cook, and also temporarily sent people to help, but still could not serve meals on time. Now, only five people are used, and the meals are easily made.
    Now, in addition to ensuring that the Liujiaping mess hall provides enough food, good food, low cost, and less grain consumption, it also pays attention to hygiene, supplies boiled water, heats food for late commune members, and ensures that commune members do not eat cold food and water, and do not get sick from food.
    Recently, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting on mess halls in Tunchang County, and specifically summarized the experience of Liujiaping in running mess halls democratically, and promoted it throughout the region.

### 有问题发动群众解决  刘家坪食堂越办越好

    有问题发动群众解决
    刘家坪食堂越办越好
    本报讯　“食堂生活大改善，男女老少都喜欢，七天不吃重样饭，比在俺家还美满。”这是山西省屯长县卫星人民公社刘家坪生产大队队员赞美集体食堂的顺口溜。这个食堂办的呱呱叫，人人满意，个个欢迎。
    刘家坪食堂创办之初，队领导干部怕社员吃粮超过标准，规定按份打饭，平均分配食物。结果，有的吃不饱，有的吃不了，饭场秩序不好，排队拥挤，每吃一顿饭至少得两个钟头。社员们议论纷纷。党支部书记刘登云看到这种现象，就召集社员开会研究。果然，问题解决了。社员们腾出一座院落作饭厅，各户自带桌凳，每桌一人轮流打饭；同时，取消了限量分配办法。这样，不仅饭场秩序好转，而且粮食也没有超过定量。
    吃饱的问题解决了，又发现饭食花样太单调，不能适应大家的需要：吃素的人不能吃荤，老年人啃不动烤窝窝，病人和产妇喜欢吃稀的。针对这种情况，党支部又发动炊事员开展粗粮细作的竞赛，迅速增加了食品花样。早饭有玉米面圪塔、红面窝窝、小米稀粥、玉米糊饭、山药稠饭等七种，午饭花样更多，有玉米面包子、饺子、山东煎饼、玉米面餄餎、面条、金裹银、银包金等十一种，晚饭也有和子饭、大豆米汤、绿豆稀饭等五六种；蔬菜花样更多，烹调可口，社员们越吃越香，饭场上人人欢喜。
    吃饱了，也吃好了，新问题又出现了：因为炊具笨拙，不能按时开饭，影响劳动时间。怎样办？党支部还是发动群众来解决。于是，一个改革炊具的合理化建议运动开展了。炊事员提出风箱改土吹风机，菜刀改切菜机。党支部立即组织铁木匠去作，苦战三天，试制成功脚踏吹风机、切菜机等五种炊具。每种工具都是成本低，效率高，操作方便，省人省时间。原来食堂用八个人作饭，还临时派人帮忙，也不能按时开饭。现在只用五个人，轻松松地就把饭做好了。
    现在，刘家坪食堂除做到吃饱、吃好、花钱少、用粮少以外，还讲究卫生，供应开水，给迟到的社员热饭，保证社员不吃冷饭冷水，不因食致病。
    最近中共长治地委在屯长县召开食堂现场会议，专门总结了刘家坪民主办食堂的经验，向全区推广。
