Hero Canal
Sun Min

Like a giant star rising from the source of the Yellow River, the Yellow River leap demonstrates that people must despise and overcome all difficulties! The canal water flowing from the leap sings the praises of the communist spirit day and night!

Half a year ago, on Zadi Mountain, where "waves are three zhang high even without wind, and it is difficult to pass even on clouds," in the Gulangwan (Bone Wave Bay) with its huge waves and earth-shattering roar, at the Sanfo (Three Buddha) Cliff, where "birds dare not come," in this five-li long Yellow River canyon with ten thousand mountains facing each other on towering cliffs, people began to build a canal. And today, a Yellow River diversion irrigation canal, like a silver belt, winds around the cliffs of the mountain waist, and in the Jiutan area, a wooden Yellow River bridge has been built, so that the rolling water flies over the Yellow River, flows through thirty-five kilometers, and irrigates 33,300 mu of mountains, rivers and plains.

In terms of scale, this is a small stream! However, when history tells us that the Western Qin, Tang, and Qing dynasties all tried to build bridges here and failed, the small canal shows the spirit of the people of Gansu, who do not avoid difficulties and march towards nature with a communist spirit!

Bridge

In Jiutan, there is a wooden arch bridge like a rainbow, flying over the perilous Yellow River. The bridge is 22 meters high, 160 meters long, and has a span of 47 meters. The Yellow River water flows from the bridge to the land that has been arid for many years.

This Dadu Bridge is a flower of the communist spirit of the working people, breaking superstitions and daring to think and act.

When the discussion about building the bridge began, there were two options. One was a steel cable suspension bridge designed by a technical graduate from a water conservancy college, and the other was a wooden arch bridge designed by Tao Weimin, a water conservancy staff member who had only two years of junior high school education. The former would cost hundreds of thousands of yuan and take one to two years, while the latter would save labor and materials, take less time, and be completed quickly. Which method was better? A debate began. This was a struggle between two lines. The Yongjing County Committee of the Communist Party of China held four meetings and mobilized the masses for discussion. Finally, it was decided to use Tao Weimin's design. However, the technician who thought he had "scientific" knowledge still vehemently opposed the wooden arch bridge design on the grounds that "it is not recorded in books" and "there is no theoretical basis." He asserted: "This plan is 90% unreliable. If it succeeds, I will be considered a conservative."

The masses were very indignant, as if they had been insulted. The masses vowed: We are not afraid of any difficulties, we are revolutionaries! Tao Weimin gave the draft to the masses for discussion and asked everyone to help revise it. The masses regarded Tao Weimin as the representative of their will, helped him study every technical detail, and put forward thirty-two suggestions for revision, turning a draft into a precise construction drawing.

In early spring, the Yellow River was flowing with ice floes, and the earth was covered with white snow. Communist Party member Pan Shuwei took the lead, stripped naked and jumped into the Yellow River ice water, which was more than one zhang deep, to explore the depth of the water, set up cofferdams, and build bridge piers. Dozens of people fought hard in the water, which was as piercing as cones, for four days and four nights, and built the bridge piers before the flood season. Communist Party member Dong Shaode, with the determination to build the bridge even at the cost of his own sacrifice, crossed the Yellow River along a steel cable erected over the river, risking his life, and erected several large ropes across the river, preparing for the bridge construction.

Spring, with its myriad colors, arrived. People enthusiastically transported stones and erected wood. During the day, there were ten thousand dots of human figures, and at night the lights were brilliant, and the sound of people overwhelmed the waves. They constructed while modifying the design. In this way, after five months of hard work, the people of Yongjing County erected the first wooden arch bridge in the Yellow River since ancient times. The wisdom of the people triumphed! The "more, faster, better, and more economical" (多快好省) line triumphed!

Recruitment Notice

A red list was posted on the stone wall of Dashikeng: "The Zhadilang Project is the throat of our canal. A special recruitment notice is issued. Which township or commune has heroes who are willing to accept this task, tear off this red list." The front of the red list was full of people, discussing it.

Zadi Mountain is a natural barrier on the Hero Canal line. There is a folk song that describes it like this: "Looking up at Zadi Mountain, the top pierces the clouds; bowing to the base of the stone cliff, the waves roll and churn, even immortals find it difficult to pass, and birds dare not stand." The surrounding chaotic peaks and stone walls of this mountain, like sharp knives, extend into the heart of the river like a goose's head in the north. The riverbed is very narrow, the water drop is large, and the river water is forced to be angry, often jumping more than three zhang high and hitting the stone wall with force. When measuring the canal line, it was determined to use the drop here, and it was selected as the inlet of the entire canal to bring the water up the mountainside. It was extremely difficult to blast a canal on the cliff, because people could not reach the cliff, nor could they stand on the cliff. The Party General Branch of the Hero Canal Project then posted a recruitment notice. The recruitment notice encouraged the heroes who built the canal. The migrant workers from Liujiaxia bravely tore off the red list.

Liujiaxia is a non-beneficiary area, and the migrant workers came to support the project. They had just completed the arduous Sanfo Cliff project and arrived in front of Zadi Mountain. After seeing the recruitment notice, everyone began to debate. Some people were unwilling to tear it off. They said: "The canal water will not flow to our doorsteps and will not irrigate our land. There is no need to risk our lives to fight Zadi!" However, the vast majority of people were eager to tear off the list, fearing that others would tear it off. They said: "Everyone's affairs cannot be divided into yours and mine. In 1953, Liujiaxia suffered a severe drought, and the people of Shaanxi transported grain for us to eat. We must have an overall concept. No matter where it is, more grain will be produced, which is the wealth of the country. Everyone will be rich, and helping others is also helping ourselves." Communist thought finally triumphed. Wang Shangzhong, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Liujiaxia Township and Captain of the Migrant Workers, accepted the commission of the migrant workers in the whole township, held the red flag high, solemnly walked to the front of the red list, tore off the recruitment notice, and contracted to fight Zadi Mountain. They divided into three classes: Field Battle, Assault, and Commando, and attacked Zadi from the east, west, and middle routes.

Although the east and west routes were dangerous, people could still climb the steep walls with ladders and ropes. The stone cliff in front of the middle route commando class was close to the Yellow River waves, and the cliffs on both sides were layered, making ladders useless. Migrant workers Kong Fanmiao, Kong Lingqi, Kong Lingcang, and Kong Xiangnian thought of the method of crossing the river from the opposite bank to the front of the stone wall. These people ran to the opposite bank of the river, each wrapped a sheepskin bag, and jumped into the rapids. One moment they were thrown into the air by the waves, and the next moment they were thrown to the bottom of the river. Kong Lingcang and Kong Xiangnian were washed downstream by the raging waves; Kong Fanmiao and Kong Lingqi overcame the floods, swam to the opposite bank, grabbed the edges of the rocks, nailed stakes into the cliff, and tied thin ropes. After several life-and-death struggles, they finally tied a steel cable to the north and south mountains. When they went to work, they slid from the north bank to the south bank on the steel cable, drilled holes and set off cannons, split mountains and blasted rocks, and when they got off work, they slid back from the rope. Just as they sang themselves: "There is no path in front of Zadi Mountain, a steel cable is erected between the north and south, heroes are not afraid of滔天 waves, showing their power in the air."

The sound of cannons shook the Yellow River waves, and the heroes attacked Zadi Mountain. The mountain surrendered, and a Yellow River diversion canal finally appeared on the waist of Zadi Mountain, where birds dared not stand.

Sharing Life and Death

The communist spirit of overcoming nature is inspired by communist ideology, and it has also established a communist friendship of sharing life and death between people.

On May 15th, Li Tingcai and Zhang Tianci were drilling cannon holes on the cliff of Xifangding (Western Top). Every time they climbed to the work site, there was a risk to their lives. Every time they went up, they always wanted to drill deeper cannon holes and blast more stones. On this day, when the command post issued a signal to retreat to a safe area, they continued to work regardless of the danger, until the signal to detonate the cannon appeared, then they climbed to the top of the cliff. Just as they climbed to a place nine zhang high, the cannon sounded, and the mountain was shaking. The two hurriedly squatted under a tiger's mouth to avoid the flying gravel. Suddenly, the large stone block under Zhang Tianci's feet slipped off the cliff and rolled into the Yellow River, and Zhang Tianci also rolled into the Yellow River. A comrade-in-arms was in distress! The migrant workers on the mountains on both sides were very anxious. At this time, there was a rumbling of cannons and flying rocks, and people on the cliff could not get into the river to rescue him. At this critical moment, everyone saw Li Tingcai stand up from the tiger's mouth, jumped out of the cliff with both feet, and fell from the cliff more than nine zhang high together with the blasted rocks, plunged into the Yellow River with a "swoosh"!

The yellow waves were rolling Zhang Tianci downstream. He saw that Zhang Tianci had lost control of his strength in the water. What to do? In his eagerness, he stepped on the water, unfastened his belt, and threw one end in front of Zhang Tianci, and shouted with all his strength: "Hold on tight!" Zhang Tianci was rescued to the river bank by Li Tingcai relying on this cloth belt.

On the shore, people surrounded Li Tingcai and Zhang Tianci. Li Tingcai's leg was injured. Everyone advised him to rest, but he didn't listen at all, and climbed up the cliff again with a limp. Li Tingcai's selfless act of saving his comrade was spread on the construction site, inspiring people to overcome all dangers and difficulties, and became an important spiritual force for conquering the mountains!

Ode

On the shoal opposite the Bingling Temple, a famous site of ancient culture, there are many large stones, which the local people call Luban Stone. Legend has it that Luban once built a bridge here, but it was all in vain, and he threw down the stones and left. The power of the Yellow River water has subdued people for thousands of years. In the Yongjing County Chronicles, a prefect wrote such a poem: "Mountain peaks and waves, waves and sand, green mountains on both sides clamp the water's edge, the first famous bridge cannot be kept, and ancient monuments lie in the reeds with hatred." Today, on the construction site of the Yellow River Dadu Bridge, on the five or six li long stone walls along the canal in the most dangerous Zadi Mountain, Xifangding, and Sanfo Cliff, there are poems everywhere. The migrant workers wrote down their determination and aspirations in poems. In a short poem titled "The First Lesson of Migrant Workers," it is written: "Hero Canal, a big project, crossing the Yellow River,穿石峡. We migrant workers have hands, we are not afraid of any difficulties!" People who came to participate in this project could not help but write poems praising the heroes who built the canal and praising the communist spirit. Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to the construction site to inspect the work. He was moved by the communist spirit of the heroes who built the canal, and also wrote a poem: "Heroic people, heroic canal, Yellow River leap, Yellow River miracle, Dayu and Luban are not worth mentioning, erect a red flag in front of Zadi Mountain." Comrade Zhang Zhongliang has said to the people of the province more than once: The Hero Canal is a representative of the communist spirit of the people of Gansu. The people of the province must use this spirit to launch a larger-scale march towards nature! (Attached picture)

    英雄渠
    孙民
    像一颗巨星在黄河的源头升起了，黄河飞渡昭示着人们要藐视、克服一切困难！从飞渡上流过的渠水，日夜歌唱着共产主义风格！
    半年前，在“无风三丈浪，架云也难穿”的扎地山，在大浪大涛，惊天动地的骨岔浪湾，在“飞鸟不敢来”的三佛崖，就在这一段五华里长的万山入云绝壁对峙的黄河峡谷里，人们开始修建渠道。而今天，一条引黄灌溉的渠道，像一条银色的带子缠绕在峭壁如削的山腰，并且在九滩一带，修建一座木制的黄河大桥，使滚滚流水飞过黄河，流经三十五公里，浇山川塬地三万三千余亩。
    从规模上看，这是一条小溪！但是，当历史告诉我们，西秦和唐朝、清朝都曾在这里修桥而且都失败的时候，小渠却显示了甘肃人民不避艰险向大自然进军的共产主义气魄！
    桥
    在九滩，有一座采虹般的木拱桥，飞架在天险黄河的上空。桥高二十二公尺，长一百六十公尺，跨度四十七公尺。黄河流水从桥上流向干旱多年的土地。
    这座大渡桥是劳动人民破除迷信，敢想敢为的共产主义风格的花朵。
    开始讨论修桥的时候，有过两个方案。一个是水利专科学校毕业技术员设计的钢丝绳大吊桥，另一个是只上过二年中学的水利科员陶维民设计出的木拱桥。前者要花钱几十万元，需时间一年到两年，后者省工省料时间少，完工快。究竟用哪种方法好呢？一场辩论开始了。这是一次两条路线的斗争。中共永靖县委开了四次会议，又发动群众进行讨论。最后肯定用陶维民的设计。但是那位以为有“科学”知识的技术员，仍然以“书上无记载”，“没有理论根据”为借口，激烈反对木拱桥的设计。他断言：“这个方案90％的靠不住，如果成功了，我算保守派。”
    群众的情绪非常激愤，像受到侮辱一样。群众的誓言是：任何困难都不怕，我们就是革命派！陶维民把草图交给群众讨论，请大家帮助修改。群众把陶维民当作自己意志的代表，帮助他研究每一个技术细节，提出了三十二条修改意见，把一张草图变成了精确的施工图。
    初春，黄河正在流凌，大地上一片白雪。共产党员潘树伟带头，赤身跳在一丈来深的黄河冰水里，探查水的深度，摆围堰，筑桥墩。几十个人在刺骨如锥的水里，苦战了四天四夜，赶在洪水期前修起了桥墩。共产党员董绍德抱着宁肯自己牺牲也要把桥架好的决心，沿着架在河上的一条钢丝绳，冒着生命的危险渡过黄河，架起数条过河大绳，为架桥作好了准备。
    万紫千红的春天到了。人们热情地运石块、架木头，白天人影万点，夜里灯火辉煌，人声压过波涛。一边施工，一边修改设计。这样，苦战了五个月，永靖县的人民在黄河上架起了亘古以来第一座木拱桥。人民的智慧胜利了！多快好省的路线胜利了！
    招贤榜
    大石坑的石壁上贴出了一张红榜：“扎地浪工程是我渠咽喉，特出榜招贤，那个乡、社有英雄好汉，愿接受此一任务，揭此红榜。”红榜前面，站满了人，纷纷议论。
    扎地山是英雄渠线上的天险，有一首民歌这样形容它：“仰望扎地山，顶巅穿云端；俯首石崖根，波浪滚滚翻，神仙难过此，飞鸟不敢站”。这个山头四面的乱峰石壁，像锋利的尖刀，北面像个鹅头一样伸进了河心。河床很窄，水的跌差大，河水被逼的愤怒了，经常是一跳三丈多高，用力击打石壁。测量渠线时就确定利用这里的跌差，选定这里为全渠的进水口，把水引上山腰。在绝壁上炸开一条渠道，工程异常艰巨，因为人们无法走到悬崖上去，也无法在悬崖上立脚。英雄渠工程的党总支，于是贴出了招贤榜。招贤榜鼓舞着修渠的英雄。来自刘家峡的民工们，勇敢地撕下了红榜。
    刘家峡是非受益区，民工们是来支援的。他们刚刚完成三佛崖的艰险工程，来到了扎地山前。看到红榜以后，大家展开了辩论。一部分人不愿意揭榜。他们说：“水渠流不到自己的门前，浇不到自己的地，用不着卖命打扎地！”但是，绝大部分的人磨拳擦掌要揭榜，唯恐被别人揭去。他们说：“大家的事，不能分你的我的。1953年刘家峡大旱，陕西人民运粮给我们吃。我们要有整体观念，不管他是哪里，多打了粮食，都是国家的财富，大家都富裕，助别人也是帮自己。”共产主义的思想终于取得了胜利。刘家峡乡党委副书记、民工中队长王尚忠接受全乡民工们的委托，高举红旗，严肃地走到红榜跟前，揭下了招贤榜，包打扎地山。他们分成野战、冲锋、突击三班从东、西、中三路攻打扎地。
    东西两路虽然艰险，人们还可以靠云梯、靠绳索爬上陡壁，中路突击班的石崖面前紧挨着黄河巨浪，两侧是断崖层层，云梯都无济于事。民工孔繁苗、孔令琦、孔令仓和孔祥年想到从对岸渡河到石壁前的方法。这几个人跑到河对岸，每人包一个羊皮袋，跳进了急流。他们一忽儿被浪头抛到半空，一忽儿又被掷向河底。孔令仓和孔祥年被恶浪冲到下游去了；孔繁苗和孔令琦战胜了洪水，游到了对岸，抓住石头的棱角，在崖壁上钉下了桩子，拴上了细绳。又经过几番生死的搏斗，终于用一根钢丝绳绑住了南北二山。他们上班时从钢丝绳上由北岸滑到南岸，打眼放炮，劈山炸石，下班时再从绳上面滑回来。正像他们自己歌唱的：“扎地山前无路径，南北架起钢丝绳，英雄那怕滔天浪，空中往来显威风。”
    炮声震翻黄河浪，英雄攻打扎地山，大山投降了，一条引黄大渠，终于出现在飞鸟不敢站的扎地山腰。
    生死与共
    战胜大自然的共产主义气魄，是共产主义思想鼓舞着的，也建立了人与人间的生死与共的共产主义的友爱关系。
    5月15日，李廷才和张天赐，在西方顶的悬崖上打炮眼。每次爬上工作地点，都要有一次生命的危险。他们每次上去，总想多打深炮眼，多炸掉几方石头。这天，当指挥台上发出向安全区躲避的信号时，他们仍不顾危险的继续工作，直到点炮的信号出现了，才向崖顶爬去。刚刚爬到九丈来高的地方，炮响了，大山在摇摆。两个人急忙蹲在一个老虎口下，躲避飞来的碎石。突然，张天赐脚下的大石块滑出崖壁滚下黄河，张天赐也跟着滚到黄河里去了。战友遇难了！两岸山峰上的民工们万分焦急。这时正是炮声隆隆，飞石满天，崖上的人无法下河救人。就在这千钧一发之际，大家看到李廷才从老虎口里站了起来，双脚一跃飞出了石崖，从九丈多高的峭壁上，同炸掉的石块一起凌空而下，“嗖”的一声扎进了黄河！
    黄色的浪，正卷着张天赐向下游滚去，看到张天赐在水里失去了控制自己的力量。怎么办？他急中生智，踩着水，解下了自己的腰带，把一头甩到张天赐的面前，拼出全身的力气大喊一声：“抓牢”。张天赐就靠着这条布带被李廷才救上了河岸。
    在岸边，人们围住了李廷才和张天赐。李廷才的腿却跌伤了。大家劝他休息，他根本不听，一跌一跛的又爬上了崖壁。李廷才舍身救同志的事迹在工地上传颂着，激励着人们去战胜一切险恶和困难，成为征服大山的重要精神力量！
    颂歌
    古文化盛地炳灵寺对岸的浅滩上，有许多大石块，当地群众称他是鲁班石。传说鲁班曾经在这里修过桥，终于是白费心机，扔下石块走了。黄河水的威力，把人们慑服了几千年。永靖县志上，有一位太守作了这样一首诗：“山峰滔浪浪滔沙，两岸青山夹水涯，第一名桥留不住，古碑含恨卧芦花。”今天，在黄河大渡桥工地，在最艰险的扎地山、西方顶、三佛崖五、六华里长的沿渠石壁上，到处都是琳琅满目的诗歌。民工们用诗写下了自己的决心和壮志。在一首题为“民工第一课”的短诗中写道：“英雄渠，工程大，过黄河，穿石峡。我们民工有双手，什么困难都不怕！”来参加这个工程的人，也都情不自禁地写下了赞颂修渠英雄，盛赞共产主义风格的诗篇。中共甘肃省委第一书记张仲良同志到工地检查工作，他被修渠英雄们的共产主义风格感动，也题诗一首：“英雄人民英雄渠，黄河飞渡黄河奇，大禹鲁班不足道，扎地山前树红旗。”张仲良同志不止一次地向全省的人民说：英雄渠是甘肃人民共产主义风格的代表，全省人民就是要用这种精神，向大自然展开更大规模的进军！（附图片）
