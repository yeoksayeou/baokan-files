Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd: Premier Kim Il-sung's speech at the banquet celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement:

Respected Vice Chairman Zhu De, Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, Dear Comrades, Friends:

Today, the government delegation of our country is very happy to be in Beijing to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement.

This agreement is making a great contribution to consolidating and developing the friendship and brotherly cooperative relationship between the people of Korea and China, and to promoting the socialist construction of the two countries.

During our Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of the American imperialists, the fraternal Chinese people aided our people with their blood.

After the signing of the armistice agreement, our country was in an extremely difficult situation. The economy suffered extremely serious damage, cities and villages were in ruins, and the people's lives were in dire straits.

Despite this, in the post-war period of restoring and building the people's economy, we received great assistance from you and other fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, just as we did during the war.

The huge aid of 800 million yuan given to us by the Chinese people in the post-war period played a huge role in rapidly restoring and developing our people's economy under our difficult conditions.

As long as Korea needed products and machinery and equipment, Chinese workers, regardless of the impact on their own factories or the shortage of raw materials, gave priority to producing and quickly sending them to Korea.

At the same time, many technicians were dispatched to help our rehabilitation work, and for nearly ten years, they obligatorily nurtured our orphans, taught them technology, and sent them back to their country.

Encouraged by the assistance of you and fraternal countries, the Korean people, under the leadership of our Party, displayed selfless labor spirit, completed the reconstruction of the people's economy in three to four years, and achieved great achievements in the cause of socialist construction.

This year, our country's total industrial output value will increase to 5.5 times that of 1953 after the armistice, and the total grain output will reach 3.7 million tons. Our people's lives have been significantly improved.

The greater the achievements the Korean people have made in socialist construction, the more the Korean people remember the great achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War and the great economic and technical assistance given to us by the fraternal Chinese people in the post-war period.

Today, in the happy life of our people, there is the merit of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and the sincere assistance of all the Chinese people. Today, I would like to once again, on behalf of all the Korean people, express my warm gratitude to the Chinese people, who often give our people warm and fraternal assistance.

With the leap forward of socialist construction in Korea and China, the economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries is being further developed. This year, the trade volume between our two countries has increased tenfold compared to 1954.

Some new agreements on economic cooperation between Korea and China signed in Beijing not long ago once again clearly show that the friendly cooperative relationship between our two countries is developing.

On the Yalu River, which connects the traditional friendship between the people of Korea and China, we will use the hard work of the people of the two countries, especially with the long-term loans given to us by the Chinese government, to build a large-scale hydroelectric power station, and we will also receive from China many factory equipment such as the textile industry necessary for our people's lives.

In economic, cultural, scientific, and technological fields, the mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries is being further strengthened.

The development of economic and cultural ties with the People's Republic of China will give great help to our country's socialist construction.

Comrades:

Our two peoples of Korea and China are comrades-in-arms who have shared life and death and shared weal and woe in the struggle against imperialist aggression.

With the active support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the peoples of Korea and China fought side by side against the American imperialist aggressors, causing the enemy to suffer a decisive and disastrous defeat militarily and politically.

Today, our two peoples are closely united in the East, firmly defending the Eastern peace front.

The peoples of Korea and China are brothers cooperating with each other in building socialism. Today, our two peoples are helping each other, encouraging each other, and launching a high tide of socialist construction.

We can say with certainty that we will further develop this mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries and further develop mutual assistance and cooperation with the socialist camp countries to develop our people's economy and improve our people's lives at a speed that imperialism can never keep up with.

I propose:

For the further development of economic and cultural cooperation between Korea and China,

For the eternal friendship and unity of the two peoples,

For further consolidation of the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union,

For the health of Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai,

For the health of all distinguished guests and diplomatic envoys to China,

Cheers!

    朝中人民紧密团结坚守东方和平阵地  互相帮助互相鼓舞高速建设社会主义
    金日成首相在庆祝朝中经济文化协定五周年宴会上讲话
    新华社23日讯　金日成首相在朝中经济及文化合作协定签订五周年庆祝宴会上的讲话。文如下：尊敬的朱德副主席同志，尊敬的周恩来总理同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我国政府代表团能在北京迎接朝中两国经济及文化合作协定签订五周年，感到十分高兴。
    这一协定，为巩固发展朝中两国人民之间的友谊和兄弟般的合作关系，为促进两国的社会主义建设，正在作出巨大的贡献。
    兄弟般的中国人民在我们反对美帝国主义武装侵略者的祖国解放战争时期，用鲜血援助了我国人民。
    停战协定签订后，我国处境极为困难。经济遭到了极为严重的破坏，城市和乡村成了废墟，人民生活零落不堪。
    尽管如此，我们在战后人民经济的恢复建设事业中，也同战争时期一样，得到了你们和以苏联为首的其它兄弟国家的莫大援助。
    战后时期，中国人民所给予我们的八亿元的巨额援助，在我们困难的条件下迅速恢复和发展我国人民经济的事业中，起了巨大的作用。
    只要是朝鲜需要的产品和机器设备，中国工人们就不顾自己工厂受到影响或原料不足，优先予以生产并迅速地送到朝鲜。
    同时还派遣了很多的技术人员帮助我们的恢复工作，在将近十年的期间里，义务地抚育了我们的孤儿，把技术传授给他们，送他们回国。
    由于你们和兄弟国家的援助而得到鼓舞的朝鲜人民，在我们党的领导下，发挥忘我的劳动精神，在三——四年期间，完成了人民经济的重建事业，并在社会主义建设事业中取得了巨大的成就。
    今年我国的工业总产值，将增长到停战后1953年的五点五倍，粮谷的总产量将达三百七十万吨，我们人民的生活得到了显著的改善。
    朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中所获得的成就越大，就越使朝鲜人民想起中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战争中所建立的伟大功勋和兄弟般的中国人民在战后时期所给予我们的莫大的经济及技术援助。
    在目前，我国人民的幸福生活里，包含着英雄的中国人民志愿军的功绩，包含着全体中国人民诚挚的援助。今天，我在这里再一次以全体朝鲜人民的名义，向经常给予我国人民以温暖的兄弟般的援助的中国人民，表示热烈的感谢。
    随着朝中两国社会主义建设的飞跃前进，我们两国之间的经济文化合作正在得到进一步的发展。今年我们两国之间的贸易额，比1954年增长了十倍。
    不久以前在北京签订的一些新的朝中两国间经济合作协定，再一次清楚地表明我们两国的友好合作关系正在发展。
    在把朝中两国人民传统友谊连结起来的鸭绿江上，我们将以两国人民的辛勤劳动，特别是用中国政府给予我们的长期贷款，建设大规模的水力发电站，并且我们还将从中国得到我国人民生活所必需的纺织工业等许多工厂设备。
    在经济、文化、科学、技术等各方面，我们两国间的互助合作正在进一步加强。
    同中华人民共和国的经济、文化联系的发展，将给予我国社会主义建设以巨大的帮助。
    同志们：
    我们朝中两国人民是在反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中，同过生死共过患难的战友。
    朝中两国人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的积极支援下，并肩进行了反对美帝国主义侵略者的斗争，使敌人遭到了军事上和政治上决定性的惨败。
    今天，我们两国人民正在东方紧密地团结在一起稳固地坚守着东方和平阵地。
    朝中两国人民是在建设社会主义上互助合作的兄弟。今天，我们两国人民正在互相帮助，互相鼓舞，掀起一个社会主义建设高潮。
    我们可以肯定地说：我们将以进一步发展我们两国间的这种互助合作关系，和进一步发展同社会主义阵营国家间的互助合作，来以帝国主义永远无法跟上的速度，发展我们的人民经济，提高我们的人民生活。
    我提议：
    为进一步发展朝中两国间的经济文化合作，
    为两国人民的永恒的友谊团结，
    为进一步巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的统一团结，
    为朱德副主席和周恩来总理的健康，
    为各位来宾和各国驻华使节的健康，
    而干杯！
