Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Washington: Following Eisenhower, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also stated at a press conference on the 7th that despite the Republican Party's disastrous defeat in the congressional elections due to voters' distrust, the U.S. government still does not want to change its foreign policy.

At his first press conference after the U.S. congressional elections, Dulles pretended not to see the obvious fact that American voters greatly disliked the foreign policy he was implementing. Shamelessly, he denied that the Republican government's foreign policy had any impact on the Republican Party's failure in the elections, saying that he was "not aware that foreign policy was a particular factor in the election."

When talking about how he would deal with a Congress controlled by the Democratic Party in the future, Dulles boasted that he had "more practical experience than anyone else alive" in terms of "bipartisan cooperation" in foreign policy. He stated that post-war U.S. foreign policy had always been pursued with the support of both parties.

Dulles's remarks also fully demonstrate that although the Republican and Democratic parties attack each other on foreign policy to win votes, they are birds of a feather, and U.S. foreign policy will not undergo any significant changes as a result of the election. Dulles said, "I am not at all concerned with the party affiliation of the people I deal with, whether they are Republicans or Democrats," because he believes that "none of them" "would mix partisan prejudice into foreign policy." However, he dared not talk about whether he was worried about dealing with the emotions of American voters that were strongly reflected in the vote.

When talking about the current talks in Geneva on stopping nuclear weapons tests, Dulles hypocritically said that the "progress is not as fast as we would like," but he dared not explain why the talks were progressing so slowly. Because it is well known that the Soviet Union has repeatedly suggested that the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should permanently cease nuclear weapons tests, while the United States and the United Kingdom stubbornly reject the Soviet proposal and continue to entangle themselves unreasonably with some technical issues to obstruct an agreement on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests. In order to deceive public opinion, the United States and the United Kingdom also took advantage of the time required to summarize and prepare for the next test after a large number of tests, and announced that they would only stop nuclear weapons tests for one year. Dulles also repeated Eisenhower's statement on the 7th, saying that the United States would resume nuclear testing under the pretext that the Soviet Union had not accepted the U.S. proposal to stop nuclear testing for only one year. As for the specific time for the United States to resume nuclear testing, Dulles said it would depend on the opinions of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Defense.

At this press conference, Dulles spoke about the letters that De Gaulle had sent to Eisenhower and Macmillan, which had caused an uproar within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Dulles said that De Gaulle had "mainly" "made certain proposals" to Eisenhower and Macmillan, implying that the United States was unwilling for France to be on an equal footing with the United States and the United Kingdom.

Dulles did not touch on U.S. Far East policy at this press conference.

### 杜勒斯掩饰共和党失败  扬言美国政府外交政策不变

    杜勒斯掩饰共和党失败
    扬言美国政府外交政策不变
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：继艾森豪威尔之后，美国国务卿杜勒斯7日也在记者招待会上表明，尽管共和党在国会选举中由于选民的不信任而遭到惨败，但是美国政府仍然不想改变它的外交政策。
    在美国国会选举以后杜勒斯所举行的第一次记者招待会上，他装作看不见美国选民十分厌恶他所执行的外交政策这一明显事实。他厚着脸皮否认共和党政府的外交政策对共和党在选举中的失败有影响，他说他“没有意识到外交政策是选举中的一个特别的因素”。
    在谈到他今后将如何对待由民主党控制的国会的时候，杜勒斯吹嘘说，在外交政策的“两党合作”方面，他“比任何其他在世的人都有更多的实际经验”。他表示，战后美国外交政策方针一直是在两党的支持下推行的。
    杜勒斯的谈话也充分表明，共和、民主两党虽然在外交政策上互相攻讦以骗取选票，但它们却是一丘之貉，美国的外交政策并不会因选举的结果而有什么重要改变。杜勒斯说，“我根本不担心我所与之打交道的人的党派关系，不管他们是共和党人还是民主党人”，因为他认为“他们中间”“谁都不会在外交政策中参杂党派成见”。但是他却不敢谈到他是否担心同在投票中强烈反映出来的美国选民的情绪打交道。
    杜勒斯在谈到目前在日内瓦举行的关于停止试验核武器的会谈时假惺惺地说，会谈的“进展没有我们所希望的那么快”，但是他却不敢说明为什么会谈进展得那么慢。因为尽人皆知，苏联一再建议苏美英三国永远停止核武器试验，而美英却顽固地拒绝苏联的建议，并且仍然用一些技术性问题来无理纠缠，以阻挠在停止核武器试验问题上达成协议。为了欺骗舆论，美英还利用它们大量试验以后进行总结和准备下次试验所需要的时间，宣布只停止核武器试验一年。杜勒斯还重复艾森豪威尔7日的声明中的话，表示美国将借口苏联未接受美国只停止核试验一年的建议而恢复核试验。至于美国恢复核试验的具体时间，杜勒斯说要看美国原子能委员会和国防部的意见而定。
    杜勒斯在这次记者招待会上谈到了在北大西洋集团内部已引起一片争吵的戴高乐给艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦的信件。杜勒斯说，戴高乐曾经“主要”向艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦“提出某些建议”，他暗示美国不愿意法国同美英平起平坐。
    杜勒斯在这次记者招待会上没有触及美国的远东政策。
