Indigenous Steel Rolling Mill
This indigenous steel rolling mill, successfully trial-produced by the Gu County Steel Plant in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, is simple in construction and easy to operate. It lacks the heating furnace, circular raceway, rough rolling, cooling bed, and other equipment found in general steel rolling mills. It only has a ten-horsepower electric motor, reducer, gearbox, and small rolling mill. During operation, as long as the hot steel ingots cast from the indigenous converters are preheated in a timely manner, various products such as round steel, flat steel, and strip steel under 25 millimeters can be rolled out. Even a worker who has not learned steel rolling can master the operating techniques within two days. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Shuming photo)

    土轧钢机
    山西省长治市故县钢铁厂试制成功的这种土轧钢机，构造简单、操作方便，没有一般轧钢机的加热炉、环形滚道、粗轧、冷床等设备；只有一部十马力的电动机、减速器、齿轮箱和小轧机。操作时，只要把土转炉铸成的热钢锭及时预热，便可轧出二十五公厘以下的元钢、扁钢、带钢等多种产品。即使是一个没有学过轧钢的工人，两天内也能学会操作技术。新华社记者　周树铭摄
