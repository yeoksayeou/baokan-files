Six Joyful Poems on the Anniversary of the October Revolution
Sun Dingguo

一
“Dark clouds press down on the city, threatening to crush it”—every word of the manifesto resonates like spring thunder.
Marx and Engels point the way to a world transformed; amidst thorns, a plum blossom blooms at dawn.

二
The heroic Commune spreads from Paris,
Stirring up furious anger to sweep away the vermin.
Even if jackals and wolves regain power,
It can still make the world look to the clouds for hope.

三
The storm of struggle sweeps through Petrograd,
The October Red Flag shines brightly.
Workers and peasants cleave open a new century,
Lenin is truly worthy of being called an eagle!

四
Manifestos and proclamations are issued one after another,
The Kremlin gathers the wise and virtuous.
If Marx and Lenin have spirits, they should smile,
A long river of truth flows gently.

五
Two satellites ascend to the ninth heaven,
The heavens respectfully welcome the flying immortals.
Envy your boundless soaring power,
Billions of planets are yours to roam freely.

六
Forty-one years of triumphant song,
Copper walls and iron ramparts fortify the mountains and rivers.
The East Wind prevails over the West Wind,
What can the war merchants do at their wit's end?

    十月革命节喜赋六首
    孙定国
    一“黑云压城城欲摧”宣言字字震春雷。马恩指点乾坤转荆棘丛中放晓梅。二英雄公社传巴黎，激扬熛怒扫鼠鼷，那怕豺狼重当道。堪教四海望云霓。三斗争风暴卷俄京，十月红旗照眼明，工农劈开新世纪，列宁不愧是山鹰！四宣言文告发连篇，克姆林宫集众贤，马列有灵应含笑，长河真理流涓涓。五两颗卫星上九天，天公恂恂迓飞仙，羡卿无限翱翔力，亿万星球任往还。六四十一年凯旋歌，铜墙銕壁壮山河，东风压倒西风日，战贩穷途唤奈何？
