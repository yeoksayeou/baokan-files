	"Six Hundred Million People Are All Like Emperors Shun and Yao"
	He Li
	At the recent harvest celebration in Xushui, Comrade Zhang Guozhong, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, jokingly said: "In previous years, when we held such a meeting, we would definitely appeal to everyone like this: 'Comrades! Under the leadership of the Party, we are determined and confident to overcome the famine!' This year, there is no need to say these words!"
	Indeed, such impassioned and bitter words are completely out of sync with the times this year. Not only Xushui doesn't need to say them, but no place in the whole country needs to say them; not only this year doesn't need to say them, but never again will they need to be said!
	This year's nationwide bumper harvest marks a historic turning point in China and is the herald of humanity's conquest of nature and becoming the masters of nature. For many years, the Chinese people have been slaves to nature. In the past, there were also bumper harvests, but those harvests were largely bestowed by nature. Heaven gave us food, and we ate; heaven didn't give us food, and we went hungry. How small people appeared before nature! Year after year of prayers, yet disasters never ceased. Before liberation, even a bumper harvest, ten years out of ten, was still insignificant compared to today's high-yield satellites. After liberation, this fixed idea was broken, and land yields increased year after year, making people realize that there was great potential for increasing land production. However, because the annual increase rate was not high enough, the idea of "reaching the limit" still haunted people's minds from time to time. It was not until this year's Great Leap Forward that the power of people became particularly prominent. China's Great Leap Forward proved that people can completely conquer nature, and the Chinese people are beginning to become the masters of nature. With further development, they can completely achieve freedom, producing as much as they want!
	The struggle between man and nature is a struggle of billions of years. Throughout history, although man has captured countless positions, he has not become the master of nature. "Man will surely conquer nature" was just people's grand aspiration, and the real realization of this aspiration is in China under the leadership of the Communist Party, where private relations of production have been completely destroyed.
	In the spring of 1956, I visited Anguo, Hebei Province. At that time, the whole county proposed a plan to produce 1,000 catties of grain and 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu. I talked with an old cooperative director in his late sixties at the Hongxing Cooperative at the time, and he said with great relish that there was endless potential for production. At that time, the average yield of sweet potatoes per mu was only three to four thousand catties, but their high-yield fields had set a target of 30,000 catties. The average yield of cotton per mu was only thirty to forty catties (ginned cotton), but their plan was 600 catties. At that time, many people were discussing whether so much stuff could even fit in the field. But they were full of confidence. He said that they didn't plow the land with plows, but turned it over with spades, two spades deep. If the sweet potato tubers grow horizontally, they won't grow well, so they want them to grow deep. He had a New Year picture of "People strive to go higher" hanging in his house. He pointed to it and told me: "People's thinking must be high to have high yields. If thinking is not high, production cannot be improved." The old cooperative director's words gave me a profound education. Unfortunately, that autumn, a major flood in Hebei destroyed their crops. Their ambition did not triumph over the disaster, and then came a counter-"rash advance," which hit many advanced people. But the old cooperative director and the people of Anguo were not discouraged. They held their breath and were determined to achieve a grain yield of 1,000 catties per mu. This year, they have more than fulfilled their wishes, with an average grain yield of 3,000 catties per mu. Needless to say, it is very common to have sweet potato yields of tens of thousands of catties per mu.
	Comrade Mao Zedong recently used the line "Six hundred million people are all like Emperors Shun and Yao" to praise the Chinese people for being in an unprecedented golden age, and that six hundred million people are all sages! The wisdom of six hundred million people far exceeds the wisdom of so-called sages in history. They have done everything that the ancients never dared to do, and they have done everything that scientists never dared to imagine. Don't believe it? Which ancient person or scientist has ever made wheat yield more than 7,000 catties per mu, rice yield 120,000 catties, or sweet potatoes yield hundreds of thousands of catties?
	During the feudal rule and the semi-feudal and semi-colonial period, only a few rulers and those who served the ruling class were called "heroes and heroines" on the stage of history, while the vast majority of people were suppressed and unable to stretch out. Their intelligence and talent were humiliated by hunger and prejudice. They created the material basis for society and pushed the giant wheel of history, but what they got was cold shoulders and contempt. Only a few historical scholars who were considered "failures" recorded stories of people like Huang Daopo in their "Biographies of Astronomers and Mathematicians."
	Today, the era has finally ushered in a great light. Six hundred million people are spiritually motivated. After a series of changes in production relations, they have begun to break free from the shackles of private property. Their souls no longer roam in small personal circles. The individual's heart has been integrated with the hearts of the vast people. Collectivism has become the mainstream of the vast people. What people are thinking about is socialism and communism. All intelligence and talent are like morning dew, fresh and lovely. Farmers and workers are emerging in large numbers, and even scientists who used to think highly of themselves cannot help but feel ashamed. The collective wisdom of six hundred million people, the collectivist virtues of six hundred million people, can truly be said to be "everyone is like Shun and Yao," and even greatly exceeds Shun and Yao!

### “六亿神州尽舜尧”

    “六亿神州尽舜尧”
    贺笠
    徐水最近在庆祝丰收大会上，县委第一书记张国忠同志打趣地说：“往年这个时候开大会，我们一定是这样的号召大家：‘同志们！在党的领导下，我们有决心有信心度过灾荒！’今年呢，这些话就不用说了！”
    的确，这样激昂而辛酸的话和今年的时光是完全不相称的，不仅徐水不用说，全国任何地方也不用说了；不仅今年不用说，今后永远也不用说了！
    今年全国的大丰收，标志着中国历史划时代的转变，是人类征服自然成为自然主人的先声。多少年来中国人民都做着自然的奴隶。过去也不是没有过丰收，但那个丰收在很大程度上是自然的赋予，天老爷叫吃饭就吃饭，天老爷不叫吃就吃不上，人在自然跟前显得多末渺小呵！年年祈祷，总是灾患不绝。在解放以前，即使丰收，十成年景，和今天高产卫星比较起来，所得也很微末。解放以后，这个固定的观念被打破了，土地的产量年年增加，使人们认识到土地增产大有奔头。但是由于每年增产速度还不算高，“到顶”的观念还时时在人们心目里作怪。直到今年大跃进，人的力量今年显得特别突出，中国的大跃进证明人是完全可以征服自然的，中国人民开始成为自然的主人，再进一步发展就可以完全取得自由，要多少就生产多少！
    人和自然的斗争是亿万年的斗争。在历史上，人虽然夺取了无数的阵地，但并未成为自然的主人。“人定胜天”，只是人们的雄伟愿望，而这个愿望的真正实现，还是在共产党领导下的中国、私有生产关系遭到彻底摧毁的今天。
    1956年春天，我曾到过河北安国，当时全县提出亩产粮食千斤、皮棉百斤的计划。我在当时的红星社和一位年近六旬的老社长谈话，他津津有味地说生产潜力无尽。那时一亩甘薯普通产量不过三、四千斤，但他们的丰产田却订了三万斤。一亩棉花普通产量不过三、四十斤（皮棉），而他们的计划却是六百斤，当时有不少人议论，说这么多的东西地里摆都摆不下。但他们却是信心百倍。他说，他们的地不用犁犁，用锨翻，翻两锨深，薯块横长长不开，要它往深长，他的屋里挂着一幅“人往高处走”的年画。他指着告诉我：“人的思想要高才会有高产，思想不高生产就不能提高”。老社长的话使我受到深刻的教育。不幸那年秋天，河北一场大水把他们的庄稼摧了。他们的雄心在灾害面前没有取得胜利，接着又来了个反“冒进”，使许多先进的人受到打击。但是老社长和安国人民并没有灰心，他们憋着一股劲，一定要争取粮食亩产千斤。今年他们是超愿以偿了，粮食平均亩产三千斤。不用说，甘薯亩产几万斤已是很普通的事了。
    毛泽东同志在不久前用“六亿神州尽舜尧”这句诗赞美中国人民正处在一个空前未有的盛世，六亿人民都是圣人！六亿人民的智慧远远超过历史上所谓圣人的智慧。历来古人所不敢作的他们都作了，历来科学家所不敢设想的他们都办了。不信吗？哪一辈古人哪一位科学家曾使小麦亩产七千多斤、稻子十二万斤、甘薯几十万斤呢？
    在封建统治时期，在半封建半殖民地时期，历史的舞台上只有少数几个统治者和为统治阶级服务的人被称做“英雄豪杰”，而广大人民却被压抑着不得伸展。他们的聪明才智被饥饿和偏见所屈辱，他们为社会创造了物质基础，推着历史巨轮，但是他们所得到的却是冷眼和鄙视，只有个别被认为“不成才”的历史学者，才在他们的“畴人传”里记载着黄道婆一类的故事。
    时代进到今日，终于大放光明。六亿人民精神奋发，在一连串的生产关系的变革之后，他们开始摆脱私有财产的锁链，他们的灵魂已不再在个人小圈子里游荡了，个人的心已和广大人民的心结合成一体，集体主义已成了广大人民的主流，人们心里打算的都是社会主义和共产主义。一切的聪明才智都如朝花露放，鲜妍可爱。农民、工人，人材辈出，过去自命不凡的科学家也不免自惭形秽。六亿人民的集体智慧，六亿人民集体主义的美德，真可以说是“人尽舜尧”，而且大大地超过了舜尧！
