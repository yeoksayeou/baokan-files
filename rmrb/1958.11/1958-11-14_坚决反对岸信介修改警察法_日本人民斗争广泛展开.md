Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 13th: Representatives of Japanese religious groups, including Buddhism, Christianity, and Shinto, issued a statement today saying, "The Amendment to the Police Officer Duties Execution Law poses a great danger of infringing upon fundamental human rights, especially the freedom of religion and the freedom to preach." Therefore, they expressed their opposition.

This statement was issued by nine religious organizations, including the Buddhist Peace Agreement Council, the Japan Christian Church Society Committee, the Japan Christian Peace Movement Council, the Japan Christian Women's Temperance Society, the Japanese Branch of the International Harmony Society, the Christian Peace Society, the Humanity Loving Kindness Society, and the Maruyama Sect, after discussing the issue of opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" in Tokyo on the 11th. These nine groups are all members of the Religious Roundtable for Banning Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and they powerfully appealed to the experience of being suppressed by the Japanese militarist authorities under the "Public Security Preservation Law" before the war.

The Japan Women Writers Association and the Japan Futurist School, composed of poets, issued statements on the 12th respectively, opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the Police Law. They believe that the "Amendment to the Police Officer Duties Execution Law" is a bill that infringes upon freedom of speech and publication.

The West Japan Regional Federation of the All-Japan Department Store Workers' Union, at its fifth regular convention held in Fukuoka City on the 12th, decided to participate in the national joint action against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law."

The Japan Christian School Teachers and Staff Union Federation issued a statement on the 11th opposing the "Amendment to the Police Officer Duties Execution Law" and sent the statement to the Japanese Diet and the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The Japan Christian School Teachers and Staff Union Federation includes teachers and staff unions from fifteen Christian universities nationwide, including Rikkyo University, Kwansei Gakuin University, and Aoyama Gakuin University.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 12th: Approximately one thousand members of the All-Japan Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Workers' Unions held a one-hour protest rally in front of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry today, protesting the authorities' punishment of workers who participated in the struggle against the "Amendment to the Police Officer Duties Execution Law" and the police authorities' search of the union's offices.

The meeting passed a resolution expressing its determination to fight to the end against the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to revise the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law." After the meeting, union representatives also visited Agriculture and Forestry Minister Miura Kazuo and officials from the National Police Agency and the Metropolitan Police Department to lodge their protests.

The Osaka Federation of the Japanese Trade Union Congress, at its 13th annual meeting held on the 11th, adopted a basic policy of doing its utmost to fight against the "Amendment to the Police Officer Duties Execution Law."

The meeting also decided on a new action plan with the main contents of opposing layoffs, opposing wage cuts, and organizing workers in small and medium-sized enterprises.
