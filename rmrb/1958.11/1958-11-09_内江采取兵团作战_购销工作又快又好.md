From our Chengdu correspondent, 8th November: More than two thousand employees of the finance and trade departments in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, implemented organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization in the peak season of large-scale procurement and sales activities. They adopted the method of large-scale corps operations, which enabled the county's procurement and sales work to achieve remarkable results.

The county first demonstrated the power of the finance and trade corps in the first round of peanut procurement. Starting from October 22nd, it only took two nights and one day to rush-purchase 5.3 million catties of peanuts, exceeding the annual procurement plan by 6%, becoming the first county in the entire region to complete the task. Then, on October 25th, they cooperated with the people's communes throughout the county to distribute wages and sugarcane payments, vigorously organizing the sales of industrial products. The commercial company, led by the Minister of Finance and Trade of the County Committee and the heads of the County Commerce, Grain, and Finance Bureaus, set up stalls and carried goods to supply goods on the spot in the people's communes. Within nine days, they completed 50% of the sales task for the fourth quarter, with sales reaching 1.3 million yuan, an increase of 2,000 times compared to the same period last year. From January to August this year, Neijiang County only completed 42% of the annual sales task, and the procurement plan was less than one-third completed. Therefore, in the district-wide finance and trade work appraisal meeting in August, it was rated as the last place. In September, more than half of the cadres were transferred to support iron and steel and grain production, which made the task even more urgent and the manpower even scarcer. Under such circumstances, they felt that if the finance and trade departments continued to divide their forces and fight "sparrow warfare," they would not be able to keep up with the demands of the situation. After mass discussions, everyone believed that the only way to follow the example of industry and agriculture in carrying out large-scale production movements was to organize into corps and implement "Three-izations." To this end, under the unified leadership and arrangement of the Neijiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the four departments of commerce, grain, banking, and finance in the county were unified and organized to establish a unified Finance and Trade Leap Forward Command. Organizational militarization was implemented, centralized joint offices were set up, and large-scale collaboration was carried out. Except for a few sentries (accountants, salespersons) who remained stationary, the remaining personnel were organized into eighteen companies and eighty platoons. Under the leadership of the command, unified actions were taken, and long-term plans, short bursts, and large-scale small movements were adopted. The advantages of this approach are: 1. The forces are mobile and flexible, which solves the contradiction between few people, many tasks, and tight schedules, and relatively strengthens the forces of each department. 2. It facilitates the unified leadership of the Party Committee and the unified arrangement of labor by the agricultural cooperatives, so that agricultural production and commercial work are not mutually exclusive. For example, when the commune is digging peanuts, commerce arranges to purchase peanuts, and when the people's commune pays wages, commerce expands sales. 3. It further changes the ideological consciousness of employees, breaks down departmental boundaries, and establishes a communist style of everyone for me, and me for everyone.

    内江采取兵团作战
    购销工作又快又好
    本报成都8日电　四川省内江县财贸部门二千多名职工，在旺季大购大销活动中，实行了组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化，采取大兵团作战方法，使全县购销工作取得显著成绩。
    这个县首先在第一个回合的花生收购中，显示出财贸兵团的威力，从10月22日起，仅仅花了两夜一天时间，就突击收购花生五百三十万斤，超额6％完成全年收购计划，成为全专区最早完成任务的一个县。接着，在10月25日，他们配合全县人民公社发放工资和甘蔗款，大力组织工业品推销，由县委财贸部长、县商业、粮食、财政局长带领的商业连挑担摆摊，在各乡人民公社就地供应，九天内就完成第四季度销售任务的50％，销售金额达一百三十万元。比去年同期上升二千倍。内江县在今年1至8月，只完成全年销售任务的42％，采购计划完成不到三分之一。因此，在8月全专区的财贸工作评比会被评为最末一名。而9月份又抽走一半以上的干部，支援钢铁和粮食、更加显得任务紧，人手少。在这种情况下，他们感到财贸部门如果再分兵把口，打麻雀战，将不能赶上形势要求，经过群众讨论，大家认为只有参照工、农业搞大运动生产方式，也组织成兵团行动，实行“三化”才是办法，为此，在中共内江县委的统一领导安排下，把全县商业、粮食、银行、财政四个部门统一组织起来，成立统一的财贸跃进指挥部，实行组织军事化，集中联合办公，搞大协作，各部门除少数哨兵（会计、营业员）不动外，把其余人员编成十八个连、八十个排，在指挥部的领导下，统一行动，采取长计划短突击，大搞小运动。这种作法的优越性，1、力量机动灵活，解决了人少事多，时间紧的矛盾，相对地加强各部的力量。2、便利了党委统一领导和农业社统一安排劳力，做到农业生产和商业工作两不误。如公社挖花生时、商业就布置收购花生，人民公社发工资，商业就展开销售。3、进一步改变职工思想意识，打破部门界限，树立人人为我，我为人人的共产主义风格。
