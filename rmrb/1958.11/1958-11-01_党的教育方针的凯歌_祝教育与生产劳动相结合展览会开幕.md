A Paean to the Party's Education Policy
——Celebrating the Opening of the Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor

Since the beginning of this year, all parts of the country have further implemented the Party's education policy, ensuring that education serves proletarian politics and is combined with productive labor, thus promoting the vigorous development of education. The victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts in our country has laid the ideological foundation for the education revolution. Our Party's education policy has already unleashed tremendous power, playing a paean of triumph, advancing from victory to victory. The Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor, held in Beijing, features rich and colorful exhibits, a feast for the eyes. This is a microcosm of the great victory of the education revolution in our country, a paean to the Party's education policy! Through this exhibition, we see the great harvest of the combination of school education with productive labor nationwide, with leaps and bounds in moral, intellectual, and physical education. This exhibition will also facilitate the exchange of experiences, learning from each other's strengths, and promoting the in-depth development of the education revolution in our country. The cultural revolution and the technological revolution are advancing side by side, rapidly changing our country's poor and backward state, accelerating the building of socialism, and creating conditions for the transition to communism.

The combination of education and productive labor, the close connection between theory and practice, further prompts young students to discover problems in practice. In order to solve problems in production practice, they fiercely attack scientific fortresses, and many students have already climbed to the cutting edge of science and technology. At the Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor, the achievements in cutting-edge science and technology are the most eye-catching. We see Peking University's 30 million electron-volt induction accelerator, Tianjin University's power system AC computing platform and proton cyclotron, Harbin Institute of Technology's dedicated rapid electronic computer, Northeast Institute of Technology's rapid electronic digital computer, Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications' color facsimile machine, South China Institute of Technology's analog electronic computer, Tianjin No. 22 Middle School's semiconductor automatic controller, and hundreds of other cutting-edge scientific and technological achievements from many schools. These cutting-edge scientific and technological achievements were almost all created or imitated by young teachers and students after participating in productive labor and connecting with reality. This shows that the combination of education and productive labor is the correct path for our country to realize the cultural revolution and a necessary condition for moving towards communism. Separating education from productive labor will make people fall into a "maze" and lead to ideological rigidity. Combining education and productive labor will liberate the mind, break down superstitions, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, be full of vitality, and be able to take down cutting-edge scientific fortresses. Some bourgeois experts and professors originally thought that scientific research was impossible without them. But in such a short period of time, our schools' scientific research work has blossomed in extraordinary ways. Of course, some people may still criticize our education work, pointing out that it still has shortcomings and is not yet perfect. However, we must understand that any new thing cannot be perfect at the beginning; it is like the rising sun, becoming more perfect day by day; while the old is dying, incompatible with the new era. Using old methods to run education will never achieve such results. We believe that as many institutions of higher learning implement work-study programs and further closely combine education with productive labor, thoroughly changing the bourgeois practice of being divorced from production reality, cutting-edge science and technology fortresses will inevitably be taken down one by one, tomorrow will surpass today, the red flag of victory will be planted higher and higher, and the paean will be sung louder and louder.

Under the guidance of the policy of combining education and productive labor, schools across the country have carried out teaching reforms, launching a mass movement for teaching reform and textbook writing. At the Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor, the results of teaching reform are also centrally reflected. The Department of Philosophy at Peking University thoroughly reformed its teaching, incorporating participation in productive labor into the formal curriculum, implementing work-study programs, and moving the classroom to the countryside, so that theory serves practice and practice tests theory. In the past, geography departments of universities practiced "stepping on the top of Mount Lu, lying on the edge of West Lake, and returning to ask about gains, a great deal of empty talk." But now, the Geography Department of Nanjing University, combined with production practice, discovered the world's second largest underground sea with 40 billion tons of water and an underground ancient Yangtze River with 1.5 billion tons of water. Changge No. 3 Middle School in Henan Province has promoted teaching reform through work-study programs, and through productive labor, compiled local textbooks. In the teaching reform, various schools have broken down the old and established the new on a large scale, breaking down the practice of running schools behind closed doors and teaching for the sake of teaching, and establishing the practice of facing society and serving politics; breaking down the practice of being only specialized and not red, being divorced from production, and being divorced from reality, and establishing the practice of being both red and specialized, using both hands and brains, and developing in an all-round way; breaking down the formula from theory to theory and then to theory, and establishing the formula from practice to theory and then back to practice. The current schools are truly "students are also workers, and factories and colleges are indistinguishable." The great achievements of teaching reform are precisely the great victory of the Party's education policy. Schools are beginning to completely break away from the bourgeois way of running schools, eliminate the influence of bourgeois educational thought, and move towards the path of communist education!

Under the guidance of the Party's education policy, a new batch of red and expert, socialist laborers has emerged. They are not emerging one by one, but under the radiant light of the communist spirit, they are emerging as a communist collective. The Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor tells us that the Department of Economics at Nankai University, in the past nine years, individual scientific research was deserted, divorced from production, and only 900,000 words were completed; but now, with collective mobilization, combined with production, it is booming, and 4 million words have been completed in only 40 days. Students of Shanghai Fisheries College take fishermen as their teachers, going to ships, factories, and fishing villages, and their labor is very successful, completing 99 scientific research projects in 10 days. After the combination of education and productive labor in the Department of Water Conservancy at Tsinghua University, production, teaching, scientific research, and ideological training have all had great harvests, and many excellent graduates have emerged. These countless facts all show that the era of bourgeois experts and professors monopolizing science is over, and the advanced contemporary working-class intellectuals, the people's scientists, and socialist laborers have emerged. We can hear young students' bold statements everywhere, "In the past, we looked for materials in capitalist countries' literature, now let them find clues in our creations!" This new batch of intellectuals, combined with productive labor, combined with the working people, does not lower their learning quality because of this, on the contrary, their learning quality is even higher. With the great popularization of school education, more socialist laborers will emerge, embarking on a bright and splendid future. Naturally, if bourgeois intellectuals are determined to transform themselves and strive to combine with productive labor, they will also make contributions.

From universities to primary schools, since this year, they have all been running factories and farms on a large scale, cooperating closely with off-campus production enterprises, and resolutely implementing the policy of combining education and productive labor, not only training the vast majority of students to be both red and expert, but also directly supporting the great leap forward in industry and agriculture of the motherland. According to statistics from 21,100 schools in 20 provinces (cities) and autonomous regions across the country, 72,200 iron smelting furnaces and 14,400 steelmaking furnaces have now been built, and the output of iron and steel will reach 1.59 million tons by the end of this year. Many agricultural colleges and universities across the country have also been transferred to the countryside to support agricultural production. The vast number of students are closely linking their studies and progress with the socialist great leap forward of the motherland, closely related. Fundamentally changed the practice of "not hearing anything outside the window, and concentrating on reading books." We see that in the ranks of the socialist great leap forward of the motherland, the vast number of students, together with workers and peasants, labor and study at the same time. Contrary to the pessimistic predictions of those prophets, they have not "failed to become talents," they are "making steel and training people at the same time," and growing up healthily.

Under the guidance of the Party's policy of combining education and productive labor, not only schools run education, but also factories run education on a large scale, people's communes run education on a large scale, and organs and enterprises run education on a large scale, it is truly "every township has a school, every village reads books, and every family learns culture." This is the socialist cultural landscape of the working people. The Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor tells us that there are currently 1,408 institutions of higher learning in the country, with 790,000 students; 118,000 secondary schools, with 15 million students; and 950,000 primary schools, with 92 million students. (The above does not include spare-time schools). Compared with 1957, the number of institutions of higher learning increased by 515%, and the number of students increased by 80%; the number of secondary schools increased by 846%, and the number of students increased by 112%; the number of primary schools increased by 73%, and the number of students increased by 43%. Qinghai before liberation was truly a blank sheet of paper, with no institutions of higher learning, but now it has seven. The speed of development of education in our country, both in quality and quantity, has far surpassed all capitalist countries in the world. We must ensure that wherever there is productive labor, there are schools, so that education truly becomes a cause for all the people. In order to consolidate and develop the victory of running schools by the whole Party and the whole people, we need to popularize and improve at the same time. In people's communes and factories, gradually establish a complete education system. The education cause in our country is singing triumphantly on the road of the great leap forward, which is the inevitable result of implementing the combination of education and productive labor, mobilizing the masses, and taking the mass line to run education.

The Party's leadership is the lifeline of all work and the guarantee for the victory of all work. In the process of implementing the combination of education and productive labor, the Party has seized the leadership in education and scientific research work. Only when the Party has seized the leadership can the education work in our country play a paean of triumph. The victory of the Party's leadership is also the victory of the mass line. Only the correct leadership of the Party combined with the mass line can bring into play the inexhaustible wisdom and strength of the broad masses, be invincible, and overcome all difficulties. The Party's leadership in education and scientific research work has been achieved through continuous struggle. Some people are influenced by the traditional concepts of the exploiting classes, such as "all professions are inferior, only studying is superior," and "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others"; some people have bourgeois idealist views in their thinking, they oppose the materialist dialectical theory of knowledge from practice to theory and then back to practice, and advocate the idealist theory of knowledge from theory to theory and then to theory. These ideological influences are universal. Implementing the combination of education and productive labor requires a thorough break with the traditional concepts of the exploiting classes and the bourgeois idealist worldview. We must have the communist style of breaking down superstitions, burying dogmatism, and daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do; we must have the creative spirit of combining the universal truth of Marxism with the specific reality of our country, continue to mobilize the masses, break down the old and establish the new on a large scale, fundamentally negate the bourgeois set of educational ideas, teaching systems, and teaching methods, and send them to the museum of history. We must establish a socialist education system according to the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. The victory we have achieved now is only the beginning, and we must implement the struggle between two lines and two methods in every step of the education revolution, and strive for complete victory.

Implementing the combination of education and productive labor will make intellectuals working people and working people intellectuals, moving towards communism that eliminates the difference between mental and physical labor. We have already seen this vision from the Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor. Let us look far ahead, play the paean of the combination of education and productive labor, advance at double speed, and accomplish the cause that has never been seen or heard!

    党的教育方针的凯歌
    ——祝教育与生产劳动相结合展览会开幕
    今年以来，全国各地进一步贯彻了党的教育方针，做到教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合，促使教育事业万马奔腾，飞跃前进。我国政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的胜利，为教育革命打下了思想基础。我们党的教育方针，已经发生巨大的威力，高奏凯歌，从胜利走向胜利。在北京举行的教育与生产劳动相结合展览会上，展品丰富多彩，美不胜收。这就是我国教育革命伟大胜利的一幅缩影，是党的教育方针的凯歌！通过这次展览会，我们看到全国学校教育结合生产劳动的大丰收，在德育、智育、体育几方面都有飞跃的提高。这次展览会并将交流经验，取长补短，促进我国教育革命的深入发展，文化革命和技术革命并驾齐驱，迅速改变着我国又穷又白的面貌，加速建成社会主义，为过渡到共产主义创造条件。
    教育和生产劳动结合，理论与实际密切联系，进一步促使青年学生在实践中发现问题。为了解决生产实践中的问题，他们猛攻科学堡垒，有许多学生已攀上科学技术的尖端。在教育与生产劳动相结合展览会上，最引人注目的是在科学技术尖端方面的成就。我们看到，北京大学的三千万电子伏特的感应加速器，天津大学的电力系统交流计算台和质子回旋加速器，哈尔滨工业大学的专用快速电子计算机，东北工学院的快速电子数字计算机，北京邮电学院的彩色传真机，华南工学院的模拟电子计算机，天津二十二中的半导体自动控制器，以及许多学校几百种的尖端科学技术成就。这些尖端科学技术成就，几乎都是青年教师和学生在参加生产劳动、联系实际以后创造或者仿造出来的。这就说明，教育结合生产劳动，是我国实现文化革命的正确道路，是走向共产主义的必要条件。教育和生产劳动分离，会使人们陷入“迷宫”，思想僵化。而教育和生产劳动结合，就会解放思想，破除迷信，敢想敢说敢做，有生命力，能够拿下尖端科学堡垒。一些资产阶级的专家和教授原来以为要搞科学研究，离开了他们就不行。可是在这样短的时间内，我们学校的科学研究工作就开出了奇异花朵。当然，有些人还可以批评我们的教育工作，还有缺点，还不完善。可是，要知道任何新生的东西，在开始的时候，都不可能十全十美的，它正如旭日东升，日趋完美；而旧的东西，则正在走向死亡，它和新时代不相适应。用旧办法来办教育，绝不会得到这样的成就。我们相信，随着许多高等学校半工半读，教育生产劳动的进一步紧密结合，彻底改变资产阶级的脱离生产实际的做法，尖端科学技术堡垒必然一个个被攻下，明天又将超过今天，胜利的红旗越插越高，凯歌越唱越响。
    在教育和生产劳动结合的方针指导下，全国学校进行了教学改革，掀起了群众性教学改革和编写教材的运动。在教育与生产劳动相结合展览会上，教学改革的成果也作了集中的反映。北京大学哲学系彻底进行教学改革，将参加生产劳动列入正式课程中，实行半工半读，把课堂搬到农村，使理论为实践服务，实践检验理论。高等学校地理系过去实习，是“脚踏庐山顶，仰卧西湖边，归来问收获，空话一大篇”。而现在南京大学地理系，结合生产实际，发现了藏水四百亿吨的世界第二个地下海和藏水十五亿吨的地下古长江。河南长葛三中勤工俭学推动了教学改革，通过生产劳动，编写出乡土教材。在教学改革中，各个学校大破大立，破关门办学、为教学而教学，立面向社会、为政治服务；破只专不红、脱离生产、脱离实际，立又红又专、手脑并用、全面发展；破从理论到理论又到理论的公式，立从实践到理论又回到实践的公式。现在的学校，真是“莘莘学子亦工人，工厂学院两难分”。教学改革的巨大成果，正是党的教育方针的伟大胜利。学校开始彻底摆脱资产阶级的办学方式，肃清资产阶级教育思想的影响，向共产主义教育的道路前进！
    在党的教育方针的指导下，一批新的又红又专的、社会主义的劳动者涌现了。他们不是一个一个地涌现，而是在共产主义精神的光辉的照耀下，作为共产主义的集体涌现的。教育与生产劳动相结合展览会告诉我们，南开大学经济系，过去九年，个人搞科学研究，冷冷清清，脱离生产，只完成了九十万字；而现在集体动员，结合生产，轰轰烈烈，只四十天就完成四百万字。上海水产学院学生，拜渔民为师，上船、下厂、下渔村，劳动很有成绩，十天就完成九十九项科学研究项目。清华大学水利系教育和生产劳动结合后，生产教学、科学研究、思想锻炼皆大丰收，出现了许多优秀毕业生。这些数不清的事实，都说明资产阶级专家和教授垄断科学的时代过去了，当代先进的工人阶级知识分子，人民的科学家，社会主义的劳动者出现了。我们到处可以听到青年学生的豪言壮语，“从前我们在资本主义国家的文献里找材料，现在让他们到我们的创造中找线索吧！”这批新的知识分子，同生产劳动结合，同劳动人民结合，并不因为这样做而降低了他们的学习质量，反之，学习质量更加提高了。随着学校教育的大普及，社会主义劳动者将更多地涌现，迈上光辉灿烂的前程。自然，资产阶级知识分子如果决心改造自己，努力同生产劳动结合，他们也将作出贡献。
    从大学到小学，今年以来，都大办工厂，大办农场，同校外生产企业密切协作，坚决贯彻教育和生产劳动结合的方针，不仅把绝大多数的学生锻炼得又红又专，而且也直接支援了祖国工农业大跃进。据全国二十个省（市）、自治区二万一千一百所学校统计，现已兴建炼铁炉七万二千二百座、炼钢炉一万四千四百座，今年年底产钢铁量将达一百五十九万吨。全国许多农业院校也都下放农村，支援农业生产。广大学生在生产劳动中，把自己的学习和进步同祖国的社会主义大跃进密切联系起来，息息相关。根本上改变了“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读业务书”的做法。我们看到，在祖国社会主义大跃进的行列里，广大学生同工人、农民一道，一面劳动，一面学习。同那些悲观的预言家说的相反，他们没有“不成才”，正在“一面炼钢，一面炼人”，健壮地成长起来。
    在党的教育和生产劳动结合的方针指导下，不仅学校办教育，工厂也大办教育，人民公社也大办教育，机关、企业也大办教育，真是“乡乡有学堂，村村都读书，家家学文化。”这是劳动人民的社会主义文化风光。教育与生产劳动相结合展览会告诉我们，全国现有高等学校一千四百零八所，学生七十九万人；中等学校十一万八千所，学生一千五百万人；小学校九十五万所，学生九千二百万人。（以上不包括业余学校）。这些与1957年相较，高等学校增长了515％，学生增长了80％；中等学校增长了846％，学生增长了112％；小学校增长了73％，学生增加了43％。解放前的青海真是一张白纸，一所高等学校都没有，现在已经有了七所。我国教育事业在质量和数量上发展的速度，远远把世界上一切资本主义国家抛在后面。我们一定要做到哪里有生产劳动，哪里就有学校，使教育事业真正成为全民的事业。为了巩固和发展全党全民办学的胜利，我们需要一面普及，一面提高。在人民公社里，在工厂里，逐步建立起一套完整的教育体系。我国教育事业在大跃进的道路上高歌前进，这正是实行教育和生产劳动结合，发动群众，走群众路线办教育的必然结果。
    党的领导是一切工作的生命线，也是一切工作取得胜利的保证。在实行教育和生产劳动结合的过程中，党在教育工作和科学研究工作中取得了领导权。也只有党取得了领导权，才能使我国教育工作高奏凯歌。党的领导的胜利，也就是群众路线的胜利。只有党的正确领导同群众路线结合，才能发挥广大群众无穷无尽的智慧和力量，战无不胜，攻无不克。党在教育工作和科学研究工作中的领导权是经过不断的斗争而取得的。有些人受到“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”、“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的剥削阶级的传统观念的影响；有些人在思想认识上有资产阶级唯心主义观点，他们反对从实践到理论而又回到实践的唯物辩证法的认识论，主张从理论到理论又到理论的唯心主义的认识论。这些思想影响，是带有普遍性的。实行教育和生产劳动结合，就要同剥削阶级的传统观念以及资产阶级唯心主义世界观作彻底的决裂。我们要有破除迷信、埋葬教条主义、敢想敢说敢做的共产主义的风格，要有以马克思主义的普遍真理同我国具体实际相结合的创造精神，继续发动群众，大破大立，把资产阶级的一套教育思想、教学制度、教学方法加以根本否定，送到历史博物馆中去。我们要根据教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育和生产劳动结合的方针，建立一套社会主义的教育体系。我们现在取得的这个胜利只是开始，我们要在教育革命的每一个步骤上都贯彻两条路线，两种方法的斗争，争取全胜。
    实行教育和生产劳动结合，将使知识分子劳动化，劳动人民知识化，走向消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别的共产主义。我们从教育与生产劳动相结合展览会上已经看到了这个远景。让我们高瞻远瞩，高奏教育和生产劳动结合的凯歌，兼程前进，干出那见所未见、闻所未闻的事业来吧！
