    Rattlesnake Corpse Displayed for a Month
    Over Ten Thousand People Received Negative Education
    Xinhua News Agency, 10th -- The evidence of the American aggressors' instigation of the Taiwan Kuomintang Air Force to use "Rattlesnake" missiles, which has been on display at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace for a month, ended this afternoon.
    This exhibition, sponsored by the Ministry of National Defense, has been visited by 157,000 workers, peasants, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, cadres of government organizations, students, and others from the capital and all over the country since it began on October 10th. The exhibition was also visited by the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers and international friends working or visiting China.
    After visiting the exhibition, the audience expressed great anger at the new crimes of American imperialism in invading our country. Many people wrote in the opinion book their determination to resolutely oppose American aggression and liberate the motherland's territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu. The heroes of the Volunteers said during their visit: The American paper tiger was defeated on the Korean battlefield, and is now using missiles by the remnants of the Taiwan Kuomintang, who were already defeated by the Chinese people. No matter what it uses, it cannot save the fate of the inevitable demise of imperialism.
