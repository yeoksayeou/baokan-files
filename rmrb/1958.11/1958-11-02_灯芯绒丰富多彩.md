    Corduroy Becomes Rich and Colorful

    Corduroy is durable and beautiful, making it ideal for children's autumn and winter clothing and hats. However, for a long time, its varieties have been relatively monotonous: either red, blue, or brown. At the same time, because cutting the pile was done manually, it restricted the improvement of production, and shortages often occurred in the market.

    During the Great Leap Forward, this neglected situation was broken. We can now buy a newly produced printed corduroy. It is manufactured using a new printing technology - spray printing, and the colors are bright and attractive. There is also a jacquard corduroy. The fabric surface is concave and convex, giving it a three-dimensional effect, which is also novel and beautiful.

    Shanghai First Corduroy Factory has also created the first automatic pile-cutting machine in China, replacing heavy manual labor and increasing production efficiency tenfold. The production problem can also be solved.

    灯芯绒丰富多彩
    灯芯绒耐穿，美观，最适合做儿童的秋冬季服装和鞋帽。可是，长期以来它的品种比较单调：不是红，就是蓝，再不就是咖啡色。同时，由于割绒是用手工操作，限制了产量的提高，市场上常发生脱销现象。
    在大跃进中，这个冷落的局面给打破了。我们可以买到一种新出的印花灯芯绒。它是用印花新技术——喷印印刷花制造的，色泽鲜艳动人。还有一种提花灯芯绒。布面呈凹凸形有立体感，也新颖美观。
    上海第一割绒厂还创造出国内第一部自动割绒机，代替了繁重的手工劳动，生产效率提高十倍。产量问题也可以解决了。
