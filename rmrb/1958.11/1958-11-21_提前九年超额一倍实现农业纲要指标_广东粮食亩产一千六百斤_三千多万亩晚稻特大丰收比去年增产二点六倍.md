Xinhua News Agency, Guangdong, 20th – Guangdong Province, the largest late rice planting area in China, has achieved a super harvest. The province's 34 million mu of late rice yielded an average of 1,100 jin per mu. The average annual grain yield reached over 1,650 jin per mu, achieving the targets stipulated in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program nine years ahead of schedule and exceeding them by 100%.

Of the 34 million mu of late rice in Guangdong Province, over 22 million mu have already been harvested. Based on actual harvest results and estimates for the unharvested portion, with an average yield of 1,100 jin per mu, production increased by more than 260% compared to last year's 300 jin. The total output of the province’s 9 million mu of autumn sweet potatoes is expected to reach 15.7 billion jin (converted to rice). Adding the early crop yield of 17.2 billion jin, the annual total grain production is 70.3 billion jin (rice accounting for 70%), an increase of more than 180% compared to last year's 24.5 billion jin. The province has an average of over 1,820 jin of grain per person, with rice accounting for over 1,270 jin. Thus, the grain problem that the entire party and people of Guangdong Province have been striving to solve with all their might for the past nine years since liberation has been resolved.

Large-scale high yields of grain, especially large-scale high yields of late rice, are a major feature of this year's bumper harvest in Guangdong Province. The average yield of late rice in all seven special districts exceeded 1,000 jin per mu. Among the province's 117 counties and cities, 61 counties and cities had late rice yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu, with 7 counties exceeding 2,000 jin per mu. High-yield late rice fields yielding over 5,000 jin and demonstration plots yielding over 10,000 jin were everywhere. Including early rice, 97 counties and cities had annual rice yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu, with 19 counties achieving yields of 2,000 jin to 3,000 jin per mu. Another characteristic of the bumper late rice harvest is that not only did the original high-yield areas experience significant increases in production, but also many low-yield areas have turned around and leaped to the forefront. For example, the 2.2 million mu of late rice that has been harvested in the Gaoyao Special District has an average yield of over 1,600 jin per mu, an increase of five times compared to last year's 265 jin.

In the past few years, Guangdong has been one of the provinces with the fastest growth in grain production in China. Grain yield per unit area ranks second in the country. This year's early rice (including spring harvest) also increased by 6.7 billion jin, an increase of nearly 70%. However, because early crops in most parts of the country increased several times over, Guangdong's achievements seemed less prominent. This was mainly due to the Guangdong leadership's underestimation of the national grain production situation in the first half of the year and a certain complacency within the Guangdong Party. The Provincial Party Committee made full use of this situation at the time, calling on the entire party and people to recognize the situation, eliminate complacency, make up their minds, focus on late rice, and regain the leading position in grain production. Leadership organs at all levels in Guangdong Province have revised grain production increase targets several times and launched a large-scale high-yield movement for double-thousand-jin counties, triple-thousand-jin townships, four-thousand-jin communes, five-thousand-jin teams, and ten-thousand-jin mu throughout the province.

When Guangdong Province proposed a large-scale late rice high-yield movement, the preparatory work for late rice had already ended, and summer planting had already begun. Time was very tight, which brought difficulties to the late rice high-yield movement. However, the Provincial Party Committee believed that it was necessary to move forward, stressing that deficiencies could be remedied later. Emphasizing that man can conquer nature and that the outcome can be determined later. Therefore, they focused on dense planting and management (one of the main links being topdressing fertilizer), driving other measures to follow suit. In accordance with the requirements proposed by the Provincial Party Committee of 600,000 ears per mu and 80 grains per ear, the province vigorously attacked the ear and grain barrier in the early stage of late crops, and extensively implemented dense planting during summer planting. Then, they launched a "protect ears and attack grains" movement to vigorously attack the number of grains, striving for large ears, many grains, and strong grains. After more than one hundred days of hard work, they finally won an unprecedented bumper harvest. The bumper late rice harvest proves that mobilizing the masses and fully implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, dense planting, protection (pest and disease control), tools (tool improvement), and management (field management) is the only way to achieve large-scale high-yield agriculture. Guangdong's late rice only focused more prominently on the two links of density and management, and was able to achieve 1,100 jin per mu. If the "Eight-Point Charter" is fully implemented, it is entirely possible to achieve several thousand jin per mu in one crop.

The victory of late rice production is also the result of a mass movement. Since the summer planting season, the province's counties, townships, and communes have almost without exception linked up with each other and participated in the high-yield competition movement. During the movement, the forms of large-scale airing of views, large-scale release of ideas, and large-character posters were fully used. Four to five hundred million large-character posters exerted a powerful force, fiercely criticizing various right-leaning conservative ideas, the pessimistic theories of "relying on heaven for the harvest" and "outdated theory" and "foregone conclusion theory," and implementing the idea of "continuous revolution" in agricultural production. As a result, both production and thought achieved extraordinary bumper harvests. (Attached picture)

    提前九年超额一倍实现农业纲要指标
    广东粮食亩产一千六百斤
    三千多万亩晚稻特大丰收比去年增产二点六倍
    据新华社广东20日电　我国晚稻种植面积最大的广东省获得特大丰收，全省三千四百万亩晚稻亩产一千一百斤。全年粮食平均亩产一千六百五十多斤，提前九年、超额一倍实现了全国农业发展纲要修正草案所规定的指标。
    广东全省三千四百万亩晚稻，目前已收割二千二百多万亩，根据收割实绩和未收部分的估计，以平均亩产量可达一千一百斤计，比去年的三百斤增产二点六倍多。全省九百万亩秋薯，预计总产量（折稻谷）可达一百五十七亿斤。加上早造产量一百七十二亿斤，全年共产粮食七百零三亿斤（其中稻谷占70％），比去年的二百四十五亿斤增产一点八倍多。全省按人口平均每人有粮一千八百二十多斤，其中稻谷占一千二百七十多斤。至此，解放后九年来，广东省全党全民全力以赴的粮食问题已经解决。
    粮食大面积高产，特别是晚稻大面积高产，是广东省今年大丰收的一个主要特点。全省七个专区，晚稻平均亩产都在千斤以上。在全省一百一十七个县市中，晚稻亩产千斤以上的达六十一个县市；其中亩产二千斤以上的有七个县。五千斤以上的晚稻丰产片和万斤以上的丰产田到处都有。加上早稻，全年水稻亩产千斤以上的有九十七个县市，其中亩产二千斤至三千斤的有十九个县。晚稻大丰收的另一个特点，是不仅原来的高产地区有大幅度的增产，而且许多低产地区都翻了身，一跃而跻于前列。如高要专区已收割的二百二十万亩晚稻，平均亩产达到一千六百多斤，较去年的二百六十五斤增产五倍。
    过去几年，广东一直是我国粮食增产速度较快的省份之一。粮食单位面积产量居全国第二位。今年早稻（包括春收）也增产了六十七亿斤，增产近七成。但是，由于全国多数地区早造增产数以倍计，广东的成绩就显得不够突出。这主要是由于广东省领导部门在上半年对全国粮食生产形势估计不足和广东党内存在着某种骄气的缘故。省委当时充分运用了这个情况，号召全党全民认清形势，去掉骄气，下定决心，大抓晚稻，重新夺回粮食生产的上游地位。广东省各级领导机关曾经数度修改了粮食增产指标，并在全省开展了一个双千斤县、三千斤乡、四千斤社、五千斤队和万斤亩的大面积丰产运动。
    广东省提出大搞晚稻丰产运动的时候，晚稻的备耕工作已经结束，夏种已经开始。时间已是十分紧迫，这就给晚稻丰产运动带来了困难。但是，省委认为必须前进。先天不足，后天可以补救。强调人定胜天，后天决胜。因此，狠狠地抓住了密植和管理（其中主要的一环是追肥）带动其他措施，一起跟上。全省各地按照省委提出的每亩六十万穗，每穗八十粒的要求，在晚造前期猛攻穗粒关；在夏种中大抓密植。接着又开展“保穗攻粒”运动，猛攻粒数关，争取穗大粒多，粒粒精壮。经过一百多天的苦战，终于夺得了空前的大丰收。晚稻的大丰收证明：发动群众，全面贯彻水、肥、土、种、密、保（除治病虫害）、工（工具改良）、管（田间管理）的“八字宪法”，是获得农业大面积高额丰产的唯一方法。广东晚稻仅仅比较突出地抓了密和管两环，就能亩产一千一百斤，如果“八字宪法”全面贯彻，一造亩产几千斤是完全可能的。
    晚稻生产的胜利又是大搞群众运动的结果。今年夏种以来，全省的县、乡、社，几乎无例外地都互相挂上了钩，参加了高产竞赛运动。在运动中，充分使用了大鸣、大放、大字报的形式，四、五亿张大字报发挥了强大威力，猛烈地批驳了各种右倾保守思想、“人种天收”和“过时论”“定局论”等悲观论调，在农业生产中实行“不断革命”的思想，因而在生产和思想两个方面都获得了特大的丰收。（附图片）
