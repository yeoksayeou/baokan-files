I am Guo Tongjiang, a peasant art creator from Machong Commune, Dongguan County, Guangdong Province. I started learning to draw in 1951, initially drawing pictures to support the land reform movement. Since I began drawing, I have had approximately four hundred works published in newspapers and periodicals. Since the Great Leap Forward, I have drawn seven sets of comic strips. Although these drawings are not highly artistic, they all reflect the reality of rural life in various periods and can be considered my contribution to serving politics with the weapon of literature and art. This small achievement is the result of the Party's care and cultivation.

How did I start drawing? The reason is that after liberation, we were emancipated. The crimes of landlords and local tyrants were settled, and all of this made me very excited. I wanted to paint it out, so I started drawing. I remember that my first set of comic strips was about the story of militiamen catching special agents, which was a true story in our village. Someone advised me to draw it and submit it for publication. So I drew it according to the size of the comic strips published in the newspaper and sent it to "Guangdong Literature and Art." Soon it was returned, not because the content was bad, but because it was drawn too small, and things were not clear. Later, after the editorial department made suggestions and revisions several times, it was finally published. Looking back, I didn't understand many of the basics of drawing at the time. How are the dots on the picture done? How to repair a damaged picture? What about color plates? I didn't understand at all, let alone draw well and vividly, but the Party values and cares for our workers and peasants' creations, and published my paintings, giving me great encouragement.

But I was not satisfied with my level at the time and wanted to improve. But I had no opportunity to go to school to study. I could only improve by constantly drawing more, referring to the opinions of the editorial department, and looking at other people's creations to ponder and research. We are engaged in production in the countryside, and there are not many opportunities to draw sketches. I often gesture with my fingers at vivid character movements, drawing silently in my mind. Sometimes, when I encounter a movement that disappears in an instant and the finger gestures cannot catch up, I immediately close my eyes to silently remember, imagine, and recall. Although this does not seem as scientific as drawing sketches, it helps a lot in capturing images and silently writing some actions during creation. I remember that when I first gestured with my fingers, the drawing was not specific, only a vague image. After a long time, after getting used to it, I could draw very specifically. Now when I gesture at a dynamic movement with my fingers, I can feel whether the drawing is good or bad. I often look at other people's paintings and compare them with my own works, which is very helpful for improving myself.

The comic strips I draw are all self-edited and self-drawn, because there are many things to draw in the countryside, so there is no need to adapt things that you are not familiar with. The problem is how to collect themes and how to summarize and concentrate on life phenomena. At first, I didn't know how to summarize and concentrate, I just drew whatever I saw. Although the content was real, it was not vivid and not very touching. Later, with the help of the editorial department, I gradually learned to concentrate on the most moving and typical things in life. For example, if someone does something very meaningful, but the plot is not vivid, and some plots that can better illustrate this matter happen in the village, even if it does not happen to this person, I also know how to incorporate it. If some contradictions occur, but have not developed, I will talk to the people involved and anticipate the results of the development of the matter, and I will boldly imagine it. The story becomes more vivid and the content is richer. For example, during the Great Leap Forward this year, our peasants were very enthusiastic and worked hard day and night. I really wanted to express it. In the countryside, there are many materials that can express the hard work of the peasants, but how can we express that the hard work of the peasants is voluntary and joyful, and it is better to say happy work than hard work? I finally discovered a vivid thing: a rural barber who was originally very busy, became idle when everyone was very busy, which is a very interesting thing. I especially chatted with him to understand the situation. During the conversation, I saw that several peasant brothers had very long hair, and when they passed by here, they only borrowed a razor to shave their beards and left. The barber couldn't keep them. So I compiled and drew a set of comic strips, describing a barber who could not find anyone to get a haircut during the Great Leap Forward, and finally found the masses in the field to get a haircut. This reflected the peasants' labor enthusiasm of turning hard work into happy work from the side, and was welcomed by some readers.

Although I do not have great achievements, I deeply feel through my own experience that peasants drawing is not a very magical thing. As long as we break superstition and dare to draw, don't think that only those who have attended school can draw. During the Great Leap Forward, many indigenous experts in industry and agriculture were workers and peasants. Can't we workers and peasants also produce experts in literature and art?

    我是怎样学画的
    广东东莞农民　郭同江
    我是广东省东莞县麻涌公社的农民美术作者，1951年开始跟人家学画，最初画些配合土改运动的画。从学画到至今在报刊上发表了的作品大约四百多幅。大跃进以来我画了七套连环画，这些画虽然艺术性不高，但都是反映各个时期的农村现实生活的，算是尽了自己的一分力量，用文艺的武器为政治服务。而这一点成绩都是党的关怀与培养的结果。
    我是怎样画起画来的呢？原因是解放以后我们翻身了，地主、恶霸的罪行被清算了，这一切都使我十分兴奋，十分激动，想把它画出来，于是就开始画画。记得我头一套连环画是画民兵捉特务的故事，这是我们村里的真事。有人劝我画出来投去出版，我便按报上发表的连环画的大小画好寄到“广东文艺”，不久就退了回来，不是内容不好而是画得太小了，东西画不清楚。后来经过编辑部提意见修改了好几次，终于发表了。回想当时我对许多画画的常识都是不懂的，画上的网点是怎样搞的呢？一幅画坏了一点怎样修补呢？有色版又怎么搞的呢？全不懂，更加谈不到画得好和画得生动了，可是党是重视和爱护我们工农的创作，把我的画发表，给我很大的鼓舞。
    但我自己也不满足于当时的水平，要求提高一步。可是我没有机会进学校学习。只有通过不断多画，多参考编辑部的意见，多看别人的创作去揣摩、研究。我们在农村搞生产，画速写的机会也不多，我就经常对着生动的人物动作，用手指比划着，在心里默画，有时遇到一瞬间就消失的动作，手指比划也赶不及的时候就马上闭着眼睛来默记、想像、追忆。虽然这似乎没有画素描画速写那样科学，但对捕捉形象和创作时默写一些动作帮助很大。我记得最初用手指比画时，画得不具体，只有模糊的形象，时间久了习惯了之后，就可以画得很具体。现在我对着一个动态，用手指来比划时可以感觉得到画得好不好。我常看别人的画，还常把自己的作品拿来对比，对提高自己有很大好处。
    我画的连环画全是自编自画的，因为农村里很多东西可画，不必改编自己不熟悉的东西。问题是如何搜集题材，如何把生活现象概括和集中。初时，我也不会概括、集中，只是见什么画什么，内容虽然真实，但不生动，不大感动人，后来经过编辑部的帮助，我逐渐懂得集中生活中最动人和最典型的东西。譬如某人做了一件事情很有意义，但是情节不生动，而有些能够更突出说明这件事的情节在村里发生了，虽然不是发生在这个人的身上，我也懂得把它编进去。有些矛盾发生了，但未曾发展下去，我就找有关的人谈，把事情发展的结果也料到了，我也就大胆地设想下去。故事便生动些，而且内容更丰富了。譬如今年大跃进，我们农民干劲冲天，日夜苦战，我很想把它表现出来。在农村中，能表现农民苦干的素材是很多的，但怎样才能表现农民的苦战是自愿的，是欢乐的，与其说苦战，不如说乐战呢？我终于发现了一件生动的事：有个原来很忙的乡村理发师，在大家很忙的时候，他闲起来了，这是很有趣的事情。我特别找他聊天，了解情况，在谈话当中，看到几个农民兄弟头发很长，走过这里时只借一把剃刀剃了一下胡子就走了，理发师留也留不住他。于是我就编画了一套连环画，描写一个理发师在大跃进中找不到人理发，结果下到田头才找到群众理发的故事。从侧面反映农民变苦战为乐战的劳动热情，受到一些读者的欢迎。
    我虽然没有很大的成绩，但是我通过自己的经历，深深感到农民画画并不是很神奇的事情，只要破除迷信，大胆画，不要以为只有进过学校才能画画。大跃进中工业、农业有许多土专家都是工农群众，难道文艺方面，我们工农就不能出现专家吗？（附图片）
