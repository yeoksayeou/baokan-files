Xinhua News Agency, November 5th: According to TASS, Leningrad, November 4th, Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, said at a mass rally of working people in Leningrad on November 4th that we live in a great era in which the inevitable historical development leads to the final victory of socialism and communism throughout the world. Socialism has now transformed from an ideal into a great and indestructible world force, a force that has astonished all mankind with its tremendous victories.

This mass rally was held by the people of Leningrad to welcome the delegation of the Polish People's Republic.

Speaking about the important significance of the dictatorship of the proletariat at the meeting, Khrushchev pointed out: "Modern revisionists are attempting to strike at the heart of the working class's liberation movement. To this end, they are doing everything possible to slander the dictatorship of the proletariat and oppose it to democracy."

Khrushchev said that no matter how many political forms arise during the transition from capitalism to socialism, and no matter how different they are, their essence, as Marx and Lenin predicted, must be only one: the dictatorship of the proletariat. He said that only the dictatorship of the proletariat can guarantee the working class's leadership over society, guarantee the continuous increase in labor productivity, guarantee the flourishing of genuine democracy for all working people, and guarantee the improvement of the people's living standards. He said that it is no accident that modern revisionists are concentrating their efforts on attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat, which takes the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class as its highest principle.

Khrushchev said that revisionists often talk about the characteristics of this or that country to cover up their words and deeds against the dictatorship of the proletariat, but they have not, and cannot, cite any example to show that socialism can be built successfully without the dictatorship of the proletariat. Based on the dictatorship of the proletariat, the countries of the socialist camp are constantly achieving remarkable victories in building a new life. The experience of many countries, including the Polish People's Republic, shows that people's democratic countries victoriously fulfill the various functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat under new historical conditions.

Khrushchev also mentioned that the Polish United Workers' Party and its Central Committee, headed by Comrade Gomulka, dealt a resolute blow to the revisionists.

Khrushchev emphasized that "Revisionists promote these views in an attempt to ideologically disarm the working class and spread the poison of distrust in its own strength within the ranks of the working class. It is by no means accidental that international imperialist reactionaries praise revisionists in every possible way and support them. The Communist and Workers' Parties resolutely counterattack the attacks of modern revisionists and expose their true traitorous faces of betraying the interests of the working class. The Communist and Workers' Parties will continue to wage an irreconcilable struggle for the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory and will continue to strengthen the unity of their revolutionary ranks."

Khrushchev then spoke about the great significance of the October Revolution. He pointed out that the enthusiasm and conscious creativity of the broad masses in the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, and their high level of consciousness, have formed an unusual force. Khrushchev said that we are experiencing an era in which, for the first time in history, the working people on vast lands have become free creators and masters of life. Labor in a society without exploiters is elevating and changing people. Day-to-day labor in factories, fields, and laboratories is pushing history forward, bringing our countries step by step closer to socialism and communism.

Khrushchev added that capitalism creates disputes and spreads hostility among people generation after generation. Socialism, on the other hand, has produced a powerful force like the fraternal friendship of the people of all countries. In a historically short period of time, the fraternal family of the people of all countries that have embarked on the road of socialist construction has been formed and consolidated, and a powerful socialist camp has emerged.

In his speech, Khrushchev also focused on the friendship between the Soviet and Polish peoples. He pointed out that the Soviet people consider the Polish people to be sincere friends. The era of disputes between Russia and Poland is gone forever. Now, the relations between the two countries are those of genuine friendship and cooperation. Both the Polish and Soviet peoples understand that the closer and more consolidated their friendship, the friendship among all socialist countries, the more inviolable our countries will be to any enemy, and the more consolidated the cause of world peace will be. The alliance and friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union are in line with the fundamental interests of the fraternal people of our two countries and with the interests of the people of all countries in the entire socialist camp.

The head of the delegation of the Polish People's Republic, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Gomulka, also spoke at the mass rally. He focused on the friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union. He said that there had been close ties between Polish revolutionaries and the Russian people in the past. Since the founding of People's Poland in 1944, it has consistently based its policies on an alliance with the Soviet Union. We will continue to develop and strengthen this fraternal alliance. He pointed out that the domestic and foreign policies of our two countries are completely consistent.

Gomulka said that our country has loyal friends in all directions, and friendship with the Soviet Union is particularly important. This friendship enables us to look forward to the future with hope. Only the strength of the socialist countries, only their mutual solidarity and friendship with the Soviet Union, can guarantee the further development of the socialist system.

Speaking about the great significance of the visit of the delegation of the Polish People's Republic to the Soviet Union, Gomulka emphasized that with this action, we have disrupted the enemy's calculations and strengthened the unity of our two countries and the entire socialist camp.

In his speech, Gomulka also condemned the policy pursued by certain imperialist blocs of arming West Germany and equipping the West German Bundeswehr with atomic weapons.

    赫鲁晓夫谈十月革命的伟大意义
    社会主义国家一步步走近共产主义
    哥穆尔卡说同苏联团结是社会主义各国发展的保证
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社列宁格勒4日讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫4日在列宁格勒市举行的劳动人民群众大会上说，我们生活的时代是一个历史发展必然导致社会主义和共产主义在全世界取得最后胜利的美好时代。现在社会主义已经由理想变成了伟大而不可摧毁的世界力量，这支力量以它所取得的巨大胜利使全人类感到惊奇。
    这次群众大会是列宁格勒市人民为欢迎波兰人民共和国代表团而举行的。
    赫鲁晓夫在大会上谈到无产阶级专政的重要意义时指出：“现代修正主义者企图打击工人阶级解放运动的心脏。为了这个目的，他们千方百计地污蔑无产阶级专政，把无产阶级专政同民主对立起来。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，在从资本主义向社会主义过渡中产生的政治形式不管多少，不管多么不同，它们的实质正如马克思和列宁所预见的那样，必然只有一个，那就是无产阶级专政。他说，只有无产阶级专政才能够保证工人阶级对社会实行领导，保证劳动生产率不断提高，保证所有劳动人民的实际民主的繁荣，保证人民群众生活水平的提高。他说，现代修正主义者集中力量攻击以工人阶级领导的工农联盟为最高原则的无产阶级专政不是偶然的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，修正主义者经常谈论什么这个国家和那个国家的特点来掩饰他们反对无产阶级专政的言行，但是，他们没有举出，而且也不可能举出任何一个例子来说明没有无产阶级专政也能够胜利地建设社会主义。社会主义阵营各国在无产阶级专政的基础上正在不断取得建设新生活的卓越胜利。许多国家的经验，其中也包括波兰人民共和国的经验表明，人民民主国家在新的历史条件下胜利地履行着无产阶级专政的各种职能。
    赫鲁晓夫还谈到波兰统一工人党以及以哥穆尔卡同志为首的中央委员会给了修正主义分子以坚决的打击。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，“修正主义者宣扬这些观点是企图在思想上解除工人阶级的武装，在工人阶级队伍中散布不信任自己力量的毒素。国际帝国主义反动派百般赞扬修正主义者，并且支持他们，这也绝不是偶然的。共产党和工人党坚决反击现代修正主义者的攻讦，并且揭露了他们出卖工人阶级利益的真正叛徒面目。共产党和工人党今后仍然要为马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁而进行不调和的斗争，仍然要加强自己革命军队的团结。”
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到十月革命的伟大意义。他指出苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的广大群众的积极和自觉的创造，他们的高度觉悟形成了一股不寻常的力量。赫鲁晓夫说，我们正在经历着这样一个时代：广大土地上的劳动人民在历史上第一次成为自由的创造者和生活的主人。没有剥削者的社会中的劳动正在提高和改变着人们。工厂、田野和实验室中的日复一日的劳动正在推动历史前进，正在使我们这些国家一步步走近社会主义和共产主义。
    赫鲁晓夫又说，资本主义世世代代在人民中间制造纠纷和散布敌意。而社会主义则产生了像各国人民的兄弟友谊这样强大的力量。在历史上很短的时期内，走上社会主义建设道路的各国人民的兄弟大家庭形成了，而且巩固了，一个强大的社会主义阵营出现了。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中还着重谈到了苏波两国人民的友谊。他指出，苏联人认为波兰人民是诚挚的朋友。俄国同波兰纷争的时代已经一去不复返了。现在两国的关系是真诚友好和合作的关系。波兰和苏联人民都懂得，他们之间的友谊，所有社会主义国家之间的友谊越密切、越巩固，我们这些国家对于任何敌人来说就越是坚不可犯，世界和平事业也就越巩固。波兰和苏联的联盟和友好符合我们两国兄弟人民的根本利益，符合整个社会主义阵营各国人民的利益。
    波兰人民共和国代表团团长、波兰统一工人党中央第一书记哥穆尔卡在群众大会上也讲了话。他着重谈到了波苏两国的友谊。他说，在波兰革命者和俄国人民之间过去就存在着紧密的联系。自从1944年人民波兰建国以来，它一直以同苏联的联盟作为政策的基础。我们还将发展和加强这个兄弟联盟。他指出，我们两国的内政和外交政策的目的是完全一致的。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们的国家四面八方都有忠实的朋友，特别重要的是同苏联的友谊。这个友谊使我们能够满怀希望地展望未来。只有社会主义各国的力量，只有它们同苏联的相互团结和友谊才能保证社会主义制度的进一步发展。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到波兰人民共和国代表团访问苏联的重大的意义时强调指出，我们以这一行动打乱了敌人的算盘，加强了我们两国和整个社会主义阵营的团结。
    哥穆尔卡在讲话中还谴责了某些帝国主义集团所奉行的武装西德、以原子武器装备西德联邦国防军的政策。
