Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 24th dispatch: The first round of voting for the French National Assembly elections was held on the 23rd.

Despite being in extremely difficult conditions, the French Communist Party remains the largest party with the most votes. According to the final voting results released by the French Ministry of Interior, the French Communist Party received 3,882,204 votes, accounting for 18.9% of the total votes; the Gaullist "Union for the New Republic" received 3,603,958 votes; the Socialist Party: 3,167,354 votes; the Independent Party: 2,815,176 votes; the Popular Republican Movement: 1,858,380 votes; the Radical Socialist Party: 983,201 votes.

In the first round of voting, out of the 465 constituencies in mainland France, only thirty-nine deputies were elected by the time the aforementioned communique was released by the French Ministry of Interior. According to the current election law, a second round of voting must be held on the 30th in the remaining four hundred constituencies because no candidate received more than half of the votes.

The anti-democratic nature of the electoral system established by the De Gaulle government is already evident in the results of the first round of voting. Although the French Communist Party received the most votes, only one communist was among the thirty-nine deputies already elected, while right-wing parties such as the "Union for the New Republic" and the Independent Party, despite receiving fewer votes than the Communist Party, occupied nine and thirteen seats, respectively.

Among the other deputies already elected, the Popular Republican Movement occupied eight seats, the Radical Socialist Party two seats, and the Socialist Party two seats.

French voters showed a clear indifference to voting, with more than 6.3 million people abstaining, accounting for 22.9% of the total number of registered voters. This proportion is much higher than during the September "referendum" (when abstentions accounted for 15%).

According to the current election law, in the second round of voting to be held on the 30th, a candidate can be elected as long as they receive a simple majority, and political parties can form alliances, which favors bourgeois parties colluding to oppose the Communist Party and seize seats that should belong to the Communist Party.

    法国议会选举第一轮投票结果
    法国共产党得票最多
    反民主的选举法使右翼政党获得较多议席
    新华社24日讯　巴黎消息：23日举行了法国国民议会选举第一轮投票。
    法国共产党尽管处于极端困难条件下，仍然是获得选票最多的第一大党，根据法国内政部发表的投票最后结果，法国共产党获得了三百八十八万二千二百零四票，占选票总数的18.9％；戴高乐分子的“保卫新共和联盟”获得了三百六十万三千九百五十八票；社会党：三百十六万七千三百五十四票；独立党：二百八十一万五千一百七十六票；人民共和党：一百八十五万八千三百八十票；激进社会党：九十八万三千二百零一票。
    在第一轮投票中，在法国本土四百六十五个选区中，到法国内政部发表上述公报时为止，只选出了三十九个议员。按照现行选举法的规定，其余四百多个选区由于没有候选人得到过半数选票，必须在30日举行第二轮投票。
    戴高乐政府制定的选举制度的反民主性质，在第一轮投票的结果中已经表现得很明显。尽管法国共产党得票最多，但是在已经选出的三十九个议员中，只有一个共产党人，而右翼党派如“保卫新共和联盟”和独立党尽管所得选票比共产党少，却一个占了九席，一个占了十三席。
    在另外的已经选出的议员中，人民共和党占八席，激进社会党占两席，社会党占两席。
    法国选民对投票表现了明显的冷淡，弃权不去投票的有六百三十多万人，占登记了的选民总人数22.9％。这个比例比9月份“公民投票”时高得多（那时弃权的占15％）。
    按照现在的选举法，在30日举行的第二轮投票中，候选人只要得简单多数就能当选，而且各政党可以结成联盟，这就有利于资产阶级政党勾结起来反对共产党，霸占本来应该属于共产党的议席。
