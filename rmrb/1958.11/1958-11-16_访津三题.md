    Three Themes on Visiting Tianjin
    Xiao Xiangrong
    New Li Village
    Delighted to see the New Li Village in the Tianjin suburbs, its satellite production soaring and surpassing the rest;
    Competitively discarding old sayings to the heavens, lovingly embracing new thoughts into the verdant gates.
    Ten thousand nations spread amazed praise, all of China competes and races to run.
    Next year there will be even more dramatic changes, another several turns atop a hundred-foot pole.

    Tianjin University
    Ten thousand teachers and students happily take the lead, engaging in large-scale construction to run factories;
    Initial product completion of eight hundred items, scientific research surpassing more than ten years.
    Red and expert combination opens new paths, hand and brain connection changes old tunes.
    Talents for building the nation are now emerging in droves, soaring straight into the sky toward the Dipper constellation.

    Hongshun Lane
    Street residents are renewed daily, rising up to organize throughout the neighborhoods;
    Untangling the trivial matters of daily life, stepping onto a bright and happy path.
    Consumers transformed into producers, enemies transformed into companions and kin.
    Women, children, the elderly, and the sick all find a place of peace, gaunt faces will never again need to inquire here.

    访津三题
    萧向荣
    新立村
    喜见津郊新立村，卫星高放已超群；
    竞将旧说抛天外，爱把新思入翠门。
    万国纷传惊赞佩，九州争赛竞驰奔。
    来年更有风云会，百尺竿头又几翻。
    天津大学
    师生万众喜领先，大举兴工办厂间；
    产品初成八百件，科研胜过十余年。
    红专结合开新道，手脑相联改旧弦。
    建国英才今辈出，青云直上斗牛边。
    鸿顺里
    街道居民日日新，起来组织遍坊邻；
    解开烦琐家常事，踏上光明幸福程。
    消费转成生产者，冤家化作侣朋亲。
    妇孺老病俱安所，槁面无缘再问津。
