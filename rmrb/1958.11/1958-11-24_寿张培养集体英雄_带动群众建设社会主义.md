Shou Zhang Cultivates Collective Heroes
    Drives the Masses in Building Socialism

    (Our report) This year, Shandong's Shou Zhang County, in the great leap forward of agricultural production, has forged a large Red and Expert activist contingent. This includes people of all kinds - men, women, young, old, cadres, and the masses - and they are distributed in entire teams and batches among the various production organizations. There are teams like the "Wu Song Team," "Iron Girl Team," "Hua Mulan Team," "Mu Guiying Team," "Old Huang Zhong Team," "She Taijun Team," "Little Luo Cheng Team," as well as "Liu Hulan," "Huang Jiguang" and others, totaling five thousand nine hundred and ninety-four hero teams, and sixty thousand one hundred and thirty-two heroes. This accounts for 35.3% of the county's total attendance and approximately 20% of the county's total population. These new heroes, nurtured and educated by the Party, are a shock force on the agricultural production front, red flag pacesetters in the mass leap forward, vanguards in carrying out technical and cultural revolutions, and the backbone and bridge for the Party to unite and mobilize the masses. Such collective hero organizations are also a garden for cultivating and growing people's communist ideology. The Shou Zhang County Party Committee, precisely by relying on this essential and strong force for building socialism, has effectively implemented the Party Central Committee's guidelines, policies, and lines, creating an unprecedented harvest.

    In addition to leading the broad masses in developing large-scale high-yield fields, these more than sixty thousand Red and Expert activists have also developed 150,000 mu of satellite demonstration fields, producing more than 1.5 billion jin of grain. Most outstanding are the five "Iron Girls" (Zhao Jirong, Zhao Fengling, Zhao Yumei, Lu Huanling, and Cheng Fengyun) of Jiahe Township Commune. This year, the corn they managed yielded 30,380 jin per mu, and the millet yielded 13,758 jin per mu.

    The Shou Zhang County Party organization, relying on these collective heroes, implemented the Party's mass line and class line, launching a solid mass movement. Among the masses, each of these more than sixty thousand heroes was assigned to lead two or three people, everyone had a target, and everyone was linked, driving the broad masses forward like a locomotive pulling carriages.

    In the process of cultivating the Red and Expert activist contingent, the Shou Zhang County Party organization mainly grasped the method of the mass line. Party organizations at all levels, through continuous work summaries and bottom-up model selections, established red flag pacesetters from among men, women, young, old, cadres, and the masses, batch by batch. Then, they mobilized the broad masses to carry out a movement to learn from the red flag pacesetters. This is the concrete application of the Party's mass line working method of "from the masses, to the masses." The heroes that emerge in this way are products of the mass movement and will naturally take root in the hearts of the people. For example, after the "Iron Girls" team of Jiahe Township was established as a model among young women, eight thousand one hundred and forty-nine iron girls quickly appeared throughout the county. After setting up Sha Bao'an, the "Old Huang Zhong," as an example among the elderly, sixty Huang Zhong teams quickly appeared throughout the county. After praising a "Little Iron Ox," more than twenty-one thousand little heroes appeared. This practice of cultivating "collective heroes" is Shou Zhang County's new leadership style in the new situation.

    Currently, each people's commune in Shou Zhang County has established one hundred and ninety-three comprehensive Red and Expert universities, enrolling fifteen thousand two hundred and twenty-two activists for study. Through their practice over the past year, they are being cultivated and deepened ideologically, in revolutionary theory, and in production science and technology. At the same time, some of the most outstanding members are being absorbed into the Party ranks to strengthen the Party's power.

### 寿张培养集体英雄  带动群众建设社会主义

    寿张培养集体英雄
    带动群众建设社会主义
    本报讯　今年山东寿张县在农业生产大跃进的洪炉里炼出一支庞大的红专积极分子队伍，其中男女老少、干部群众等各类人物都有，而且是整队整批的分布在各个生产组织中间，如“武松队”、“钢铁姑娘队”、“花木兰队”、“穆桂英队”、“老黄忠队”、“佘太君队”、“小罗成队”以及“刘胡兰”、“黄继光”等共计五千九百九十四个英雄队，六万零一百三十二名英雄，占全县总出勤人数的35.3％，占全县总人口的20％左右。这些在党培养教育下的新英雄，是农业生产战线上的一支突击队，是群众大跃进当中的红旗标兵，是开展技术革命文化革命的急先锋，是党团结群众、发动群众的骨干和桥梁。这样一些集体的英雄组织，也是培植人们共产主义思想不断成长壮大的园地。中共寿张县党委会，正是由于依靠了这支建设社会主义必不可少的坚强力量，才有效地贯彻执行了党中央的方针、政策、路线，创造了空前的丰收。
    这六万多名红专积极分子除带领广大群众搞大面积丰产田之外，还搞了卫星示范田十五万亩，生产粮食十五亿斤以上。最出色的是夹河乡公社的五位“铁姑娘”（赵继荣、赵凤岭、赵玉梅、卢焕岭、程凤云），今年她们管理的玉米亩产三万零三百八十斤，谷子亩产一万三千七百五十八斤。
    寿张县党组织，依靠这些集体英雄贯彻了党的群众路线、阶级路线，掀起了踏踏实实的群众运动。这六万多名英雄们，在群众中间，每人分工带动二、三名群众，人人有对象，个个都挂钩，像火车头带动车厢一样带动着广大群众前进。
    寿张县党组织，在培养红专积极分子队伍过程中，主要掌握了群众路线的方法。各级党组织通过不断的总结工作，自下而上的评选模范，把男女老少、干部群众中间的红旗标兵，一批一批地树立起来，然后发动广大群众开展学习红旗标兵的运动，这是党的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线的工作方法的具体运用。这样出现的英雄是群众运动的产物，自然会在群众心里扎下根。如开始在青年妇女中树立了夹河乡的“铁姑娘”队，全县很快就出现了八千一百四十九个钢铁姑娘；在老年中树立起“老黄忠”沙保安的榜样后，全县很快出现了六十个黄忠队；表扬了一个“小铁牛”，出现了二万一千多个小英雄。这种培养“集体英雄”的作法，是寿张县在新形势下的新的领导作风。
    现在寿张县各人民公社，已办起了一百九十三处综合性的红专大学，吸收了一万五千二百二十二名积极分子入校学习。通过他们一年来的实践，从思想上，革命理论上，生产科学技术上进行培养和深造，同时从最优秀的成员中，又吸收一部分加入党的队伍，壮大党的力量。
