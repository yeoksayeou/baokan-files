    One day at dusk, the weather suddenly turned cloudy, the north wind howled, and there was a light drizzle. The blasters working on opening ditches and building canals on Lao Jun Mountain had already finished their work. Wang Zhengxian's blasting team of four had been running on the cliffs and precipices all day and were feeling very tired. At this time, there were still fifteen connected blasting holes left unexploded on a rock face. Wang Zhengxian thought: if they were left until the next day, the rainwater would soak into the blasting holes and they would become duds, which would be a waste of labor and explosives, and would also affect the progress of the project. So, after discussing it with Zhang Linfen, she decided to detonate the fifteen blasting holes before quitting work.

    The construction site was quiet, and the sky was getting darker and darker. The two girls dragged their tired bodies, climbed onto the rocky cliff full of blasting holes, loaded the explosives into each blasting hole, and after finding a place to hide, calmly lit the fuses. After about a minute, they had run twenty or thirty feet away and hid behind a rock. There were two loud bangs from under the rock face, and two blasting holes opened up. Wang Zhengxian turned her head and vaguely saw something squirming not far below the rock face. She suddenly cried out. The two of them stared down, and it turned out to be a large group of female laborers hurriedly climbing towards the rock face. Wang Zhengxian felt a cold sweat break out all over her body, and a thought flashed through her mind: Communist Youth League members must be responsible for the safety of the people's lives, and even if it means sacrificing themselves, they must "block" the unexploded blasting holes. She resolutely called out to Zhang Linfen, turned around and rushed down, pouncing on the rock face like a tiger, using her fingers to pinch out the fuses hanging from the blasting holes one by one. When they had pinched out twelve fuses, the thirteenth blasting hole exploded. The two heroic girls only felt a roar in their ears and almost lost consciousness. In this tense moment, the thirty or so female laborers below had safely crossed the rock face and ran towards the construction site headquarters.

    捏熄引线救人命
    有一天傍晚，天气突然转阴，北风呼呼地吹着，还下起了牛毛细雨，老君山上开沟修渠的炮杆手已经收了工，王正仙爆破组的四个人，在悬岩绝壁上奔跑了一整天，已经感到很疲倦。这时，在一堵岩子上，还剩下十五个连环炮眼没有爆破。王正仙想：如果留到第二天，雨水浸到炮眼里，就会成瞎炮，既浪费了劳力，又浪费了炸药，而且影响了工程的进展。于是，她和张林芬商量后，决定将十五个炮眼炸掉再收工。
    工地上静悄悄的，天色一阵比一阵黑，两个姑娘拖着疲惫的身体，攀上了布满炮眼的石岩，给一个个的炮眼装上炸药，找好了躲避的地方后，沉着地点燃了引线。约摸过了一分钟光景，她们已经跑出了两三丈远的地方，躲到一块石头背后。岩下传来轰隆轰隆地两响，有两个炮眼开了花。王正仙回过头去，隐约看到石岩下面不远的地方有一团什么东西在蠕动。她猛然惊叫了一声。两人定睛看下去，原来是一大群女民工正急促地往岩子爬来。王正仙身上唰地冒出了一身冷汗，脑子里闪出一个念头：共青团员，一定要对人民的生命安全负责，就是牺牲自己，也要把没有炸的炮眼“堵死”。她毅然地叫着张林芬，转身冲下去，像猛虎一样扑到岩子上，用手指把炮眼上吊着的引线一根根地捏熄。当他们捏熄了十二根引线的时候，第十三个炮眼爆炸了。两个英勇的姑娘只觉得耳里一阵轰鸣，几乎失去了知觉。就在这一紧张的时刻里，下面的三十多个女民工，已经安全地越过了石岩，向工地指挥部跑去了。
