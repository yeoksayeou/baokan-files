Turning Steel into Materials

This winter and next spring, the central task of the entire industrial production is to ensure the completion of steel tasks with both quality and quantity and to transform steel into materials. In the coming months, the entire Party and all the people should focus on steel materials as they do on steel production.

"Taking steel as the key link to drive everything else" contains two aspects of significance. On the one hand, steel takes the lead, forcing other industrial and transportation departments to keep up with the fast pace; on the other hand, with more steel, various machines can be manufactured, which in turn will create conditions for the development of other departments. The former aspect has been quite evident in the industrial front over the past two and a half months. Coal, machinery manufacturing, electricity, forest logging, basic chemicals, transportation, and all other departments directly and indirectly related to steel production have seen their output multiply. To ensure the "marshal" of steel is enthroned, many departments have been unprecedentedly tense and prosperous during this period. However, the two aspects of things are inseparable. This situation of all horses galloping forward has brought tremendous pressure to the steel industry, requiring the steel industry to provide a large amount of steel materials to ensure the leap forward in various departments, and requiring "taking steel as the key link" to play its other role. In other words, the "marshal" of steel must guarantee others in order to guarantee itself. For example, the coal industry, which is flourishing everywhere along with the steel industry, needs steel materials to manufacture hoisting, ventilation, and drainage equipment, and a large number of coking equipment; the railway department needs steel materials to add locomotives and vehicles, and steel rails to lay double tracks and new lines, to ensure the transportation of a large amount of materials needed for increased steel production; the transportation department needs steel materials to manufacture automobiles and ships to complete the transportation tasks of ore, coke, pig iron, etc. Especially the machinery industry, it must have a large amount of steel materials to manufacture the machinery and equipment needed by the steel industry and various departments. "Taking steel as the key link to drive everything else," combined with the large-scale mass movement, is bound to be "one horse taking the lead, ten thousand horses galloping." Without one horse taking the lead, there would be no possibility of ten thousand horses galloping; conversely, if ten thousand horses do not keep up and gallop, it would be difficult for one horse to continue taking the lead. However, it is often uneven, with some ahead and some behind. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to observe and adjust after a certain period, so that it gradually returns to the situation of one horse taking the lead and ten thousand horses galloping.

In the past, we focused on steel smelting, but not enough on steel materials. The problem of steel materials has become prominent. Steel materials cannot meet the needs of all parties, nor can they meet the needs of further development of steel. Why? Some may ask: Steel production has grown so fast in the past few months, why is there still a shortage of steel materials? It turns out that although the steel industry has developed rapidly in the past few months, its various links have not been developing in parallel. When the Central Committee of the Party just put forward the call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel, the main problem at that time was the shortage of pig iron, and the steel plants did not have enough raw materials. Soon, the mass iron smelting movement broke through this barrier, and the problem of pig iron production was solved. Then, there was the problem of "hating iron for not becoming steel" and how to turn iron into steel. The mass steel smelting movement also solved the problem of steel production. Now we are facing a new problem - rolling steel into materials. We can only eat one bite at a time. We cannot demand enough steel materials when steel and iron are still insufficient. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is a shortage of steel materials in the entire leap forward of the steel industry.

The shortage of steel materials is in line with the law of development of things. However, if we do not pay attention to this problem now, and do not start to tackle this problem, we will fall behind the objective situation, and will hinder the further development of the steel industry and even the entire industry. We must be good at seizing opportunities, and be good at seizing new links at the turning point, so that we can achieve one victory after another.

So, how to solve the problem of steel materials? Here, the first thing to do is to increase the production of steel ingots. To roll steel materials, there must be steel ingots first. However, at present, about half of the steel we produce every day is smelted by indigenous methods, and it must be hammered before it can become steel blocks or steel billets, which cannot be directly cast into ingots. Only those key enterprises with modern open-hearth furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces can directly cast into steel ingots. Therefore, to increase the production of steel ingots, we must first tap the potential of these key enterprises. It is estimated that if the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces nationwide is as good as that of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, the utilization coefficient of electric furnaces is as good as that of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, and half of the equipped converters are normally blown, then a large number of steel ingots can be produced by using existing equipment. However, there is a major problem that must be solved here, which is to supply these steel plants with enough good iron. At present, many key steel plants cannot supply the required pig iron in terms of quality, quantity, and on time, and this situation cannot give full play to their production potential. Therefore, all localities must continue to work hard to improve the quality of indigenous iron as soon as possible and break through the transportation barrier, and use the most effective methods to concentrate good iron as soon as possible to ensure the needs of key steel plants. This is the real key to increasing steel ingots at present, and it should not be taken lightly. Another way to increase the production of steel ingots is to improve and improve the technology of indigenous steelmaking, so that pig iron can be turned into molten steel, which can be directly cast into steel ingots. Now, Guxian Town in Changzhi, Shanxi has researched and developed indigenous open-hearth furnaces, and Shangcheng, Henan is conducting experiments on forging indigenous steel into large billets and rolling them into wire rods. Provinces have been building some small converters that combine indigenous and foreign methods. These practices should be vigorously promoted and popularized.

Having more steel ingots can only be said to have created the preconditions for solving the problem of steel materials. Undoubtedly, to increase the production of steel materials, it is more important to increase the capacity of rolling mills. In this regard, the first thing to do is to tap the potential of existing rolling mills. At present, the equipment capacity of many rolling mills has not been fully utilized, and many things that should be done have not been done, or have not been done well enough, and the masses have not been fully mobilized, and the mass movement has not really taken shape. If these enterprises immediately add a push, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, first reach the equipment utilization capacity, and then break old rules and regulations, strengthen weak links, and carry out technical revolution on a large scale, and then improve the current equipment utilization rate, they will be able to quickly produce a large batch of steel materials. Secondly, in order to increase rolling capacity, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to think of indigenous methods, manufacture indigenous rolling mills, and create indigenous rolling methods. The news published in this newspaper on the 13th that the Northeast Institute of Technology has manufactured ingot-free rolling equipment and the Xiaguan Machine Tool Plant in Yunnan has manufactured indigenous rolling mills proves that this path has great potential. At present, the general public has a greater sense of mystery about rolling steel than about smelting iron and steel, and always believes that rolling equipment must be automated and mechanized. However, facts have proved that the best quality export steel in China is produced on rolling mills manually operated in Shanghai. As long as we mobilize the masses, think boldly, and act boldly, we can set off a high tide of indigenous rolling methods, just like smelting indigenous iron and indigenous steel.

Adopting the above two methods cannot meet the needs of various departments for steel materials. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the national steelmaking capacity will reach about 30 million tons (excluding the capacity of indigenous steelmaking), but the rolling capacity is only a few million tons. This huge deficit must be made up by increasing new rolling capacity, and a large number of new rolling mills must be manufactured in order to give full play to the victorious results of iron and steel smelting and turn all steel into finished materials to meet the needs of all parties. Therefore, manufacturing rolling mills has become the most important link in the many measures to solve the problem of steel materials.

Concentrating efforts to manufacture rolling mills is the main task of the employees in the machinery industry departments and the mechanical repair and manufacturing departments of non-machinery industry departments. The employees in the machinery industry departments must take out the greatest strength and use the fastest speed to carry out the assault on manufacturing rolling equipment. Leading cadres at all levels must put politics in command and strengthen organizational work, and all relevant enterprises must strengthen cooperation so that rolling equipment is manufactured in complete sets, installed in complete sets, and smoothly put into production completely and without defects. However, manufacturing rolling mills is not enough to rely solely on the efforts of the machinery industry departments. Other departments need to give support. Here, the most prominent problem is in the allocation of steel materials, and many departments have to stop and give way. Manufacturing rolling mills must use steel materials, and steel materials are precisely the most lacking and everyone needs most at present. How should these limited steel materials be used? Should we follow the principle of "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about unevenness" and divide them equally among everyone, a few tons for you and a few tons for me, or should we concentrate them first to manufacture rolling mills? Undoubtedly, we must choose the latter. It is like eating eggs. If there are few eggs and many people, and everyone divides them all in one meal, although it solves some immediate needs, it will be difficult to continue in the next step. But if everyone endures for a while and hatches the eggs into chickens, and the chickens lay eggs again, then not only can you eat more eggs, but you can also have eggs to eat often. Concentrate efforts to solve a central problem for a period of time. When this problem is solved, it creates conditions for solving other problems, so that everyone can move forward, and then solve the next central problem. This kind of wave-like advancement is precisely a method of leading economic work that we have explored from practice and that conforms to objective laws. However, some comrades do not understand this method, and do not understand that the objective laws of economic development require us to adopt this method. They do not understand that balance is relative, and the mutual connection and dependence between various departments is only one side of the problem, while imbalance is absolute. There are always major and minor contradictions in economic life, and it is impossible for various departments to advance in step every day, every month, and every quarter. In order to ensure that we concentrate our efforts to complete the task of manufacturing rolling mills in the next few months, comrades in various departments and regions must clarify this view, consciously and voluntarily stop and give way, and work together to ensure key points.

Vigorously engage in the mass movement of producing steel materials, and vigorously engage in the mass movement of manufacturing rolling mills. This is the second battle on the industrial production front of "taking steel as the key link" at present. We have already won the victory in the previous battle, and we believe that we will definitely be able to achieve a decisive victory in this battle as well.

    变钢成材
    今冬明春，整个工业生产的中心是保证如质如量地完成钢的任务并且把钢变成钢材。在今后的几个月中，全党全民要像抓钢铁一样地来抓钢材。
    “以钢为纲，带动一切”，包含着两方面的意义。一方面是，钢铁一马当先，逼迫着其他工业交通部门不得不快步跟上去；另一方面是，钢多了，可以制造各种各样的机器，反过来又将为其他部门的发展创造条件。前一个方面，两个半月来工业战线的形势已经表现得十分明显。煤炭、机器制造、电力、森林采伐、基本化学、运输等等，举凡各种同钢铁生产直接和间接关联的部门，产量都是成倍地增长，为了保证钢铁元帅升帐，这一时期许多部门都是空前的紧张而又呈现了空前的繁荣。但是，事情的两个方面是不可分割的，这种万马齐奔的局面，反过来又给钢铁工业带来了巨大的压力，要求钢铁工业提供大量的钢材来保证各部门的跃进，要求“以钢为纲”发挥它另一方面的作用。也就是说，钢铁元帅必须保证别人，才能够保证自己。例如，随着钢铁工业一起遍地开花的煤炭工业，需要钢材来制造提升、通风和排水设备，需要大量的炼焦设备；铁道部门需要钢材添制机车车辆，需要钢轨铺设复线和新线，才能保证运送钢铁增产所需要的大量物资；交通部门需要钢材制造汽车、船舶，才能完成矿石、焦炭、生铁等等的运输任务。特别是机械工业，必须有大量的钢材，才能制造钢铁工业和各个部门所需要的机器设备。“以钢为纲，带动一切”，它跟大规模的群众运动结合起来，必然是“一马当先，万马奔腾”。没有一马当先，就不可能有万马奔腾；反之，万马不跟上去奔腾，一马就难以继续当先。但它又经常是参差不齐、有前有后的。因此，一定的时期，观察一下，调整一下，使之逐步地大体上回到一马当先、万马奔腾的形势，是完全必要的。
    过去一个时期抓了钢铁冶炼，而钢材抓得不够，钢材的问题突出了，钢材不能满足各方面的需要，同时也不能满足钢铁继续发展的需要。为什么？或许有人要问：这几个月钢铁生产增长得这样快，为什么还会发生钢材不够用的问题呢？原来，这几个月钢铁工业虽然猛烈发展，但是它本身的各个环节并不是齐头并进的。在党中央刚提出生产一千零七十万吨钢的号召的时候，当时的主要问题是生铁不足，炼钢厂没有足够的原料。不久，全民炼铁的运动突破了这道关，生铁的产量问题解决了。接着，又出现了“恨铁不成钢”、如何把铁变成钢的问题。全民炼钢的运动，把钢产量的问题也解决了。现在我们又面临着一个新的问题——把钢轧成材。饭只能一口一口地吃，我们不可能在钢和铁还不够的时候就要求有足够的钢材。因此，在整个钢铁工业大跃进的过程中，钢材不够是不足为奇的。
    钢材不够，这是合乎事物发展规律的。但是，如果现在还不重视这个问题，还不动手去抓这个问题，我们就要落在客观形势的后面，就会阻碍钢铁工业以至整个工业的进一步发展。必须善于抓住时机，善于在转变关头抓住新的环节，我们才能取得一个接着一个的胜利。
    那么，怎样来解决钢材问题呢？这里，第一件事就是要增产钢锭。要轧制钢材，必须先有钢锭。但是，目前我们每天所产的钢中，约有一半左右是用土法炼成的，要经过锤锻才能够成为钢块或钢坯，不能直接浇铸成锭。能够直接铸成钢锭的只有那些拥有现代化平炉、转炉和电炉的重点企业。因此要增产钢锭，首先要在这些重点企业中挖掘潜力。据估算，如果全国的平炉利用系数向上钢三厂看齐，电炉利用系数向本溪钢铁公司看齐，已装备起来的转炉做到有一半正常吹炼，则利用现有设备，就可以增产很大数量的钢锭。但这里有一个主要问题必须解决，就是要给这些炼钢厂供应足够的好铁。目前许多重点钢厂需要的生铁不能按质按量按期地供应，这种状况是无法发挥它们的生产潜力的。因此各地必须继续努力，尽快地提高土铁质量和突破运输关，用最有效的办法尽速地把好铁集中起来，保证重点钢厂的需要。这是目前增加钢锭的真正的关键所在，不容等闲视之。增产钢锭的另一个途径是提高和改良土法炼钢的技术，使生铁化成钢水，能够直接铸成钢锭。现在山西长治故县镇已研究出了土平炉，河南商城正在进行把土钢锻成大坯轧制线材的试验，各省已在建设一些土洋结合的小转炉，这些做法应当大力提倡和推广。
    有了更多的钢锭，只能说是为解决钢材问题创造了前提条件。毫无疑问，要增产钢材，更重要的还是要增加轧钢设备的能力。在这方面，首先要发掘现有轧钢厂的潜力。现在许多轧钢厂的设备能力还没有充分利用，许多应该做的工作还没有做，或者做得不够好，还没有把群众充分发动起来，群众运动还没有真正形成。这些企业如果马上加一把劲，集中群众的智慧，第一步达到设备利用能力，第二步打破陈规旧律，加强薄弱环节，大闹技术革命，再提高现在的设备利用率，这样，就能很快地增产出一大批钢材。其次，为了增加轧钢能力，还需要发动群众想土办法，制造土轧钢机，创造土轧钢法。13日本报发表的东北工学院制成无锭轧钢设备，云南下关机床厂制成土轧钢机的消息，证明这条道路大有可为。现在一般人对轧钢的神秘感比对炼铁炼钢尤甚，总认为轧钢设备必须自动化、机械化才行。但是，事实证明，现在我国质量最好的出口钢材，恰恰是在上海手工操作的轧钢机上生产的。只要我们把群众发动起来，大胆地想，大胆地干，我们就有可能像炼土铁土钢似的，掀起一个土法轧钢的高潮。
    采取上面两个办法，还不能满足各个部门对钢材的需要。据估算，到今年年底，全国炼钢能力将达到约三千万吨左右（不包括土法炼钢的能力在内），但是轧钢能力仅有一千几百万吨。这个巨大的缺额必须增加新的轧钢能力才能补足，必须制造大批的新轧钢机，才能充分发挥炼铁炼钢胜利的成果，把所有的钢变成成材，来满足各方面的需要。因此，制造轧钢机，又成为解决钢材问题的许多措施中最重要的一环。
    集中力量制造轧钢机，是机械工业部门和非机械工业部门的机械修理和制造部分的职工的主要任务。机械工业部门的职工，必须拿出最大的力量，用最快的速度来突击制造轧钢设备。各级领导干部必须政治挂帅、加强组织工作，各个有关的企业必须加强协作，使轧钢设备成套地制造，成套地安装，完备无缺地顺利投入生产。但是，制造轧钢机，仅仅依靠机械工业部门的努力是不够的。还需要其他各个部门给以支持。这里，最突出的一个问题就是在钢材的分配上，许多部门还要停车让路。制造轧钢机必须使用钢材，而钢材恰恰是目前最缺少、大家都最需要的东西。这有限的钢材怎样使用呢？是按照“不患寡而患不均”的原则，大家你几吨我几吨地平均分光呢，还是先集中用来制造轧钢机呢？毫无疑问，我们要选择后者。好比吃鸡蛋，蛋少人多，大家一顿分光，虽然解决了一些眼前的需要，可是下一步就难以为继了。而如果大家暂时忍耐一下，把蛋孵成鸡，鸡再下蛋，那么，不但可以吃到更多的蛋，而且可以经常有蛋吃。一个时期集中力量解决一个中心问题，这个问题解决了，反过来为解决其他的问题创造了条件，使大家都前进一步，然后又解决下一个中心问题。这样波浪式地前进，正是我们从实践中摸索出来的一条符合客观规律的领导经济工作的方法。但是，有些同志不了解这个方法，不了解经济发展的客观规律要求我们必须采取这个方法。他们不了解，平衡是相对的，各个部门相互联系、相互依赖，只是问题的一面，而不平衡则是绝对的，经济生活中任何时候都有主要矛盾和次要矛盾，各个部门不可能每一天每一月每一季都齐步前进。为了保证在今后几个月内集中力量完成制造轧钢机的任务，各个部门各个地区的同志必须弄清楚这个观点，自觉自愿地停车让路，群策群力地保证重点。
    大搞生产钢材的群众运动，大搞制造轧钢机的群众运动，这就是当前“以钢为纲”的工业生产战线上第二个战役。我们已经取得了前一个战役的胜利，相信这一次战役，我们一定也能够取得决定性的胜利。
