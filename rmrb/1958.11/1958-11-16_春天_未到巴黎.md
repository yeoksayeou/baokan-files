"Spring" Hasn't Arrived in Paris
By Our Correspondent Pan Fei

French Minister of Information Soustelle announced after the cabinet meeting on the 14th that France rejected Britain's proposal to establish a "free trade zone." This marks the entry of the struggle for markets between Britain on one side and France and West Germany on the other into a white-hot stage.

The "Common Market," composed of West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, is a customs union that emerged amidst the shrinking capitalist world market. Internally, it gradually reduces tariffs between member states until they are completely abolished; externally, it builds high tariff barriers to resist goods from other countries. This would undoubtedly be a severe blow to Britain, as it has always regarded Western Europe as its traditional market.

From its own interests, Britain proposed a counter-proposal to establish a "free trade zone." Including the six countries of the "Common Market," it would encompass seventeen countries in Western Europe. However, finding a compromise between major monopoly groups with conflicting interests is undoubtedly more difficult than diplomats clinking champagne glasses and saying a few words about "mutual dependence." Simply put, France's attitude towards Britain's proposal is: "If you want to profit in Western Europe, then let us also get some benefits within your British Commonwealth!" This is tantamount to abolishing Britain's "Imperial Preference," which of course will not be accepted by Britain.

Under these circumstances, the "free trade zone" proposal has been discussed repeatedly for two years without any results; for Britain, it remains a pie in the sky. Seeing that British goods are about to be squeezed out of the Western European market, the anxiety and unease in the City of London are self-evident. During a recent discussion of this issue by a special committee in Paris, the dispute between British and French representatives had reached the point of losing gentlemanly demeanor. The chairman of the committee, Britain's chief representative Maudling, sat down in his chair and announced: "The meeting will not adjourn until an agreement is reached!" The French representative ridiculed Britain's desire to play both sides: wanting to get a foothold in the Western European market and monopolize the Commonwealth area.

On the 14th, British newspapers spread a wave of optimism. It was said that France's attitude had changed. "The Manchester Guardian" reported: "Spring has returned to Paris; it is full of warmth and friendship everywhere." Unfortunately, the earth did not return to spring, but instead ushered in a hailstorm. The gnashing of teeth could be faintly heard in the British newspapers on the 15th. "The Daily Telegraph" wrote in an editorial: "The establishment of discriminatory principles in Europe will mean the end of the European Economic Cooperation Agency. … Political unity in Europe will be dealt a blow that will be difficult to recover for a generation."

Britain has long threatened that if France rejects the "free trade zone" proposal, if Western Europe excludes Britain, it will not hesitate to take revenge. An editorial in "The Financial Times" even advocated that Britain should quickly form another customs union with Northern Europe and Austria and Switzerland in order to counter the "Common Market." British newspapers have been clamoring in recent days for people to save "the division of Europe." But they will not understand, or dare not admit: this division is precisely an irresistible law of the capitalist world.

### “春天”未到巴黎

    “春天”未到巴黎
    本报记者　潘非
    法国情报部长苏斯戴尔在14日的内阁会议以后宣布，法国拒绝英国的关于建立“自由贸易区”的建议。这标志着以英国为一方、以法国和西德为另一方的争夺市场的斗争，已进入了白热阶段。
    由西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡六国组成的“共同市场”，是在资本主义世界市场日益萎缩的情况下出现的关税同盟。它对内逐步减低成员国之间的关税，直到最后完全废除；对外则高筑关税壁垒，抵制其他国家的商品。这对于英国，无疑地将是严重的打击，因为英国一直把西欧作为它的传统的市场。
    英国从本身的利益出发，提出了建立“自由贸易区”的对案。它所包括的成员，连同“共同市场”的六国在内，共有西欧的十七个国家。但是，想在利益冲突的各大垄断集团之间找出一个妥协的办法，无疑地，要比外交家们碰香槟酒杯，说几句“互相依赖”，要困难得多。简单说来，法国对英国建议的态度是：“如果你想在西欧占便宜，那么，也让我们在你的英联邦内部得些好处吧！”这就等于取消了英国的“帝国特惠制”，当然不会被英国所接受。
    就是在这种情况下，“自由贸易区”的方案翻来复去地讨论了两年而毫无结果；对英国来说，到头来仍然是个画饼。眼看着英国商品即将在西欧受到排挤，伦敦城的焦虑和不安是不言而喻的。最近的一个专门委员会在巴黎讨论这一问题时，英法代表间的争吵，已到了有失绅士风度的地步。委员会的主席、英国的首席代表莫德林把屁股在椅子上一坐，宣布：“不达到协议，就不散会！”法国的代表则耻笑英国想左右逢源：既想插足西欧市场，又要独霸英联邦区。
    14日的英国报纸，散布了一阵乐观空气。据说，法国的态度有了转变。“曼彻斯特卫报”报道：“春天已回巴黎；到处充满了温暖和友谊。”可惜，大地没有回春，却迎头来了一场冰雹。15日英国报纸咬牙切齿之声，隐然可闻。“每日电讯报”的社论写道：“在欧洲歧视原则的建立，将意味着欧洲经济合作局的终结。……欧洲在政治方面的团结将受到打击而一个世代难以恢复。”
    英国早已扬言，如果法国拒绝“自由贸易区”的建议，如果西欧把英国排斥在外，它将毫不迟疑地采取报复。“金融时报”的一篇社论，还主张英国尽速与北欧及奥地利、瑞士结成另一个关税同盟，以便与“共同市场”相抗衡。英国报纸近几天来一直在大声疾呼，要人们来挽救“欧洲的分裂”。但他们不会理解，或者不敢承认：这种分裂，正是资本主义世界无法抗拒的规律。
