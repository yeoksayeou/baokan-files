Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: Scientific research institutions of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and the Ministry of Transportation recently jointly convened a national conference on prestressed concrete and reinforced concrete structures in Beijing. It was preliminarily determined that next year, the country will promote 2 million cubic meters of prestressed concrete structures, which can save the country 600,000 to 800,000 tons of steel.
	Prestressing involves tightening the steel bars when prefabricating reinforced concrete components to prevent the components from bending or cracking due to excessive expansion and contraction of the steel bars, thereby increasing the load-bearing capacity of the components. Generally, components made with this pre-added coping ability can have their strength increased several times, and the use of steel bars and cement can be reduced significantly. China only began using prestressed concrete structures in 1956, and has made great achievements in just a few years. Last year, the quantity of this structure used in China was 20,000 cubic meters, and this year it has reached 200,000 cubic meters, which is ten times that of last year. Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, saved 2,650 tons of steel and reduced construction costs by 800,000 yuan this year by using more than 20,000 cubic meters of prestressed concrete components. At present, 19 provinces and cities in China have promoted prestressed concrete structures. The scope of application is also very wide, not only used in beams, roof trusses, roof panels, foundations, and crane beams in industrial and civil buildings, but also used as bridges, railway sleepers, power poles, pressure, water pipes, and mine supports.
	In the process of promoting prestressed concrete structures, construction workers have broken through technical "mysticism" and "skepticism" and have gained successful experience in manufacturing and construction. They proposed that they can complete 100% of the task with only three-quarters of the materials requested from the state. National cooperation zones, provinces and cities are about to establish prestressed concrete bases. It is expected that the amount of steel used in national capital construction next year will be reduced.

    建筑业节约钢材的重要措施
    推广预应力混凝土结构
    新华社19日讯　建筑工程部、冶金工业部、铁道部、水利电力部和交通部的科学研究机构，最近在北京联合召开了全国预应力混凝土和钢筋混凝土结构会议，初步确定，明年全国将推广预应力混凝土结构二百万立方公尺，可为国家节约钢材六十到八十万吨。
    预应力是在预制钢筋混凝土构件时，先将钢筋拉紧，不致因钢筋伸缩过大而使构件弯曲、裂断，提高构件的载重能力。一般采取这种预先加上应付能力做出的构件，强度可提高数倍，钢筋、水泥可以少用许多。我国从1956年才开始采用预应力混凝土结构，短短几年已经取得很大的成绩。去年，我国采用这种结构的数量为两万立方公尺，而今年已达到二十万立方公尺，为去年的十倍。山西省太原市今年采用了二万多立方公尺预应力混凝土构件，就节约了二千六百五十吨钢材，降低造价八十万元。目前，我国已有十九个省、市推广了预应力混凝土结构。应用的范围也很广，不仅用于工业和民用建筑中的房梁、屋架、屋面板、基础和吊车梁，而且还用做桥梁、轨枕、电杆、压力、水管、矿井支架。
    在推广预应力混凝土结构过程中，建筑业的职工们破除了技术上的“神秘论”、“怀疑论”，取得了制造和施工方面的成功经验。他们提出，只向国家要四分之三的材料，便可以百分之百地完成任务。全国各协作区、各省市即将建立起预应力混凝土基地。预计明年国家基本建设中，使用的钢材将减少。
