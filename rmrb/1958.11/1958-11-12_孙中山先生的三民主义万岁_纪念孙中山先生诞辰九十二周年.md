Long Live Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People
——Commemorating the Ninety-Second Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth
He Xiangning
The ninety-second anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth is here. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, seeing the Qing government's political corruption, its weakness and incompetence in the face of foreign powers, the bullying and aggression of imperialism, and the oppression of the people, who lived in misery, sought national independence, resistance to the great powers, and the overthrow of the feudal autocratic rule. Therefore, he initiated the organization of the Xingzhonghui and the Tongmenghui, overthrew the Qing government, and founded the Republic of China. He persevered and struggled his whole life for China's independence, freedom, and equality, and was a great pioneer of the Chinese revolution. We commemorate him forever with the most respectful feelings.

More than thirty years have passed since Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. His dying words, earnestly instructing us to "seek freedom and equality for China" and "abolish unequal treaties," still echo clearly in my ears. Many of those who worked with Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the past have passed away. Now, apart from some comrades who adhere to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and revolutionary principles, and continue to work tirelessly for the people in New China, there are others in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu who are suffering the bullying and oppression of American imperialism. Although our views differed at one point, we ultimately worked side by side under the leadership of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. So, on this day of commemoration, we might as well recall together whether we have lived up to his expectations.

Nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood are the Three Principles of the People first advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang of China, passed on January 23, 1924, clearly stated: "Nationalism has two meanings: first, the Chinese nation seeks its own liberation; second, all ethnic groups within China are equal." The "purpose of nationalism is to make the Chinese nation free and independent in the world." "Therefore, the goal of the struggle for national liberation, for the majority of the people, is nothing more than anti-imperialism." Regarding democracy, the declaration pointed out that democracy "is shared by the general public, and not privately owned by a minority." "All individuals and groups who genuinely oppose imperialism shall enjoy all freedoms and rights, and all those who sell out the country and deceive the people to be loyal to imperialism and warlords, whether they are groups or individuals, shall not enjoy such freedoms and rights." Regarding the people's livelihood, the declaration also pointed out that "the most important principles are no more than two: one is equal land rights; the other is the regulation of capital." The declaration further summarized Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People into the following clear content, that is, the true meaning of the Three Principles of the People is to "resist imperialism and warlords, resist special classes that are unfavorable to farmers and workers, and seek the liberation of farmers and workers; in other words, to fight for farmers and workers, that is, for farmers and workers to fight for themselves."

In order to realize such revolutionary Three Principles of the People, Dr. Sun Yat-sen further formulated the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit is clearly manifested in the Three Principles of the People and the three major policies he formulated. Now let us examine how to implement his legacy.

Personally, I believe that in the People's China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People have long been fully realized, greatly surpassed, and have entered the stage of socialist revolution and socialist construction. From the national perspective, New China has completely achieved national independence and has become a large family of ethnic groups closely united, free, and happy. No more imperialists dare to ride on the heads of our people and act as overlords. From the perspective of democracy, the workers, peasants, and all working people of the country have become masters of the country, our universal suffrage has been held, and the voters throughout the country have fully exercised their democratic rights. From the perspective of the people's livelihood, feudalism has long been eliminated, and private industrial and commercial enterprises have become joint state-private enterprises. Due to the rapid progress of socialist construction, our industry and agriculture are very developed. This year, steel production will exceed 10.7 million tons, and the people throughout the country are now fighting to complete this plan. This year's grain harvest is also a bumper one, with an estimated average of more than 1,000 jin of grain per person. In science, we also have made leaps and bounds. Scientists have made great achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and atomic reactors have been built. The lives of the people throughout the country have been greatly improved compared to before liberation and are gradually improving. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideas have been thoroughly realized and greatly surpassed and developed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It can truly be said that national independence has been achieved, democracy has been expanded, and the people's livelihood has been improved. I personally feel very comforted and satisfied. I think that all of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's true revolutionary followers must feel as happy and encouraged as I do.

However, on the other hand, every time I think of the fact that the motherland's territory of Taiwan has not yet been liberated, and that many compatriots there are dependent on others and suffering from oppression and trampling, I feel deeply saddened.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen told us in his will that he had devoted himself to the national revolution for forty years, and that his goal was to seek freedom and equality for China. This lofty goal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen has been realized due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China. However, everyone knows that today's Taiwan, under the trampling of American imperialism, is virtually without hope. American imperialism extends its claws to Taiwan, and of course, it is impossible to treat the compatriots in Taiwan with freedom and equality. I still remember that Dr. Sun Yat-sen often mentioned during his lifetime that it was necessary to "unite the oppressed nations and fight together to resist imperialism." He was also very concerned about and sympathetic to the national independence movements in India, Indonesia, and Burma. More than thirty years have passed. Now, not only has our great motherland overthrown the oppression of imperialism and stood tall in the world, but India, Indonesia, and Burma have also shaken off the oppression of imperialism and become nationally independent countries. The regrettable thing is that Taiwan, an inseparable part of our great motherland, has not yet been liberated. American imperialists have occupied Taiwan and are further trying to turn it into a colony of the United States. American imperialists not only control Taiwan's politics, but also control Taiwan's military, economy, and culture. At the same time, as everyone knows, Dr. Sun Yat-sen specifically emphasized "abolishing unequal treaties" in his will. In our New China, this is no longer a problem. However, in Taiwan, a part of the motherland's territory, the United States has illegally signed some unequal treaties with the Taiwan authorities under various pretexts, intensifying its control over Taiwan. In the face of this situation, can all the people in Taiwan who have national consciousness and patriotism not feel heartbroken? As for the issue of people's livelihood, Taiwan's abundant resources are being plundered by the insatiable American monopoly capitalists. Taiwan's economy is subject to the control of American imperialism and cannot be developed, and the people's lives are very difficult. Isn't this completely contrary to solving the problem of people's livelihood? Moreover, what is particularly distressing is that many industrial and consumer goods in Taiwan have to rely on American supplies. Thus, American imperialism gives you surplus materials with one hand and puts chains on you with the other. The more Taiwan relies on the United States, the more severe the United States' control over Taiwan becomes. This is the current reality in Taiwan. Can any sons and daughters of China with national self-esteem really be willing to suffer such humiliation? American imperialists only trust lackeys who are loyal to them, and they suspect and reject anyone with even a little national consciousness. The exposure of the Sun Liren anti-Chiang incident fully demonstrates the American conspiracy to support pro-American factions and use the lackeys it has created to serve as American accomplices, so as to further completely control Taiwan and bring it under its control.

Imperialism is imperialism. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nationalism is completely opposed to American colonialism. American imperialism's control of Taiwan is precisely to implement its colonial policy in Taiwan. How can it let you "implement nationalism"? American imperialism is even more afraid of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's democracy, because if the power of the compatriots in Taiwan is expanded, it will be detrimental to American imperialism. American imperialism, the "Emperor Emeritus" of Taiwan, will absolutely not allow the people of Taiwan under its "throne" to enjoy true "democracy." American imperialism is also unwilling to see Dr. Sun Yat-sen's people's livelihood realized in Taiwan, because the ultimate goal of the people's livelihood is to develop the economy. If Taiwan really realizes the people's livelihood, wouldn't American imperialism have no way to carry out its economic aggression?

The only prerequisite for the Taiwan authorities to "implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People" is to resist American imperialism. Without getting rid of the control of American imperialism, there is no way to talk about nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood.

Old friends who worked with me under the leadership of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the past, who shared weal and woe and overcame difficulties together, I miss you very much! You are located on the island of Taiwan, reciting the sentences "seeking freedom and equality for China" and "abolishing unequal treaties" in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will. When you think about the past in the quiet of the night, can you not feel heartbroken? If things continue like this, you will inevitably be blamed by future generations. Perhaps there is no need for me to say more, but for the sake of protecting your future, I earnestly hope that you will wake up in time!

Dr. Sun Yat-sen struggled tirelessly for the revolution throughout his life, opposing the Qing government's autocratic rule, opposing Yuan Shikai, and opposing imperialism. In order to build China into a country that could truly implement the Three Principles of the People he advocated, he resolutely reorganized the Kuomintang of China in 1924 and implemented the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers. China must "seek freedom and equality" and resist imperialism. Only by allying with Russia, allying with the Communist Party, and assisting farmers and workers can there be a way out. China and the Soviet Union both have vast lands and abundant resources, and the people of both countries are fighting for the same ideals. The unity and mutual assistance of these two great powers can not only guarantee the prosperity and strength of the two countries, but also is a source of strength for maintaining world peace. Today, we have realized Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal and formed a solid alliance with the great Soviet Union. If he knew this in the afterlife, he would be comforted. I am one of the witnesses to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will. Dr. Sun Yat-sen had long foreseen before his death that some people in the Kuomintang would violate the three major policies and be softened by the enemy. Therefore, in his dying moments, he earnestly instructed Wang Jingwei: "After my death, there are enemies on all sides. You must never be softened by the enemy." Wang Jingwei said: "If we are softened by the enemy like this, we will not be revolutionary." Who knew that Wang Jingwei was really softened by the enemy later, which shows that Dr. Sun Yat-sen had foresight. Dr. Sun Yat-sen also left a letter to the Soviet Union before his death, in which he said: "I would like to express my fervent hope that the dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally. The two countries will join hands in the great battle for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory." After signing the will, he specially called out to me three times: "Mrs. Liao Zhongkai." I immediately realized that Mr. Sun was still calling Zhongkai's name in his dying moments, meaning to encourage all comrades to be truly loyal to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit, that is, to implement the three major policies and resist imperialism, otherwise they would definitely be softened by the enemy, and would eventually violate Mr. Sun. Therefore, I immediately replied to him: "Mr. Sun, please rest assured, we will definitely adhere to the spirit of reorganizing the Kuomintang, implement the three major policies, resist imperialism, and cherish Mrs. Sun, and we will never forget it even if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble." He shook my hand tightly and said: "I thank you." Finally, he called out "peace, struggle, save China" several times and passed away peacefully. Today, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we must deeply understand that in his dying moments, he still kept in mind the spirit of reorganizing the Kuomintang and the painstaking efforts to adhere to the three major policies, and we must not fail to live up to his exhortations in his dying moments.

Just as Minister Peng Dehuai said in his letter to the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu: The affairs of the Chinese people should be resolved by the Chinese people themselves. If it is difficult to resolve for the time being, we can discuss it at length. This era is an era full of hope, and all patriots have a way out. Don't be afraid of any imperialism. We should turn enemies into friends, unite against foreign enemies, and smash the American imperialist plot to create two Chinas. We are all Chinese, and harmony is the most precious thing. No one is perfect, and if we correct our mistakes, we can reunite. Since the deaths of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Liao Zhongkai, the two parties have separated and cooperated twice, and more than thirty years have passed in the blink of an eye. The best plan for now is to turn enemies into friends, reconcile, and think about the happiness of future generations. Re-cooperation is the time! The motherland is carrying out a great socialist construction cause, and the door to peace talks is wide open to you. As a follower of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, one should first be a fervent patriot. One's own interests can be sacrificed, but the interests of the country and the nation must not be damaged in the slightest. The interests of the 650 million Chinese people are the eternal interests of our sons and grandsons. We must not let our enemies rejoice and our loved ones grieve. Make a decisive decision, please don't have any doubts.

I am old and can only contribute this much to you all.

Long live patriotism!
Long live the motherland!
Long live Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People! November 11, 1958

    孙中山先生的三民主义万岁
    ——纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十二周年
    何香凝
    孙中山先生诞辰九十二周年纪念到了。孙中山先生眼见清廷政治腐败，对外软弱无能，受帝国主义的欺凌侵略，对内压迫百姓，民不聊生，唯有谋求民族独立，抵抗列强，推翻封建君主专政。于是发起组织兴中会，同盟会，推翻清政府，创立中华民国。他百折不挠，为求中国独立、自由、平等，奋斗一生，是中国革命的伟大先行者。我们永远怀着最崇敬的心情纪念他。
    孙中山先生逝世至今已有三十多年。他临终遗嘱谆谆教导我们“求中国之自由平等”、“取消不平等条约”的话，还很清晰地在我的耳边回响。过去和我一起跟孙中山先生工作过的人，很多都已逝世。现在，除了有一些坚守孙中山先生遗志和革命主张的同志，在新中国继续孜孜不倦地为人民工作以外，其余还有一些人，正在台、澎、金、马受尽美帝国主义的欺凌和压迫。尽管有一个时期，我们之间的主张有所不同，但是我们究竟曾经同在孙中山先生领导之下，并肩工作过。那么，在这个纪念他的日子，我们不妨一起来回忆当年，我们有没有辜负了他的期望呢？
    民族主义、民权主义、民生主义是孙中山先生所首倡的三民主义。1924年1月23日通过的中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言中明确指出：“民族主义有两方面之意义：一则中国民族自求解放；二则中国境内各民族一律平等。”民族主义之“目的在使中国民族得自由独立于世界。”“故民族解放之斗争，对于多数之民众，其目标皆不外反帝国主义而已。”关于民权主义，宣言中指出，民权主义“为一般平民所共有，非少数人所得而私也。”“凡真正反对帝国主义之个人及团体，均得享有一切自由及权利，而凡卖国罔民以效忠于帝国主义及军阀者，无论其为团体或个人，皆不得享有此等自由及权利。”关于民生主义，宣言也指出，“最重要之原则不外二者：一曰平均地权；二曰节制资本。”宣言更将孙中山先生的三民主义概括为以下明确的内容，即三民主义的真意，是“反抗帝国主义与军阀，反抗不利于农夫工人之特殊阶级，以谋农夫工人之解放；质言之，即为农夫工人而奋斗，亦即农夫工人为自身而奋斗也。”
    为着实现这样革命的三民主义，孙中山先生更手订了联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策。
    孙中山先生的革命精神，明确表现在他手订的三民主义和三大政策之中。现在就让我们来检查如何执行他的遗训吧。
    我个人认为，在人民的中国，孙中山先生的三民主义早都已经全部实现，而且大大超过，并且已经进入社会主义革命和社会主义建设的阶段了。从民族方面看，新中国已经完全实现民族独立，已经成为各民族紧密团结、自由幸福的大家庭。再没有帝国主义敢骑在我们人民的头上作威作福了。从民权方面看，全国工人、农民及一切劳动人民都已成为国家主人翁，我们全民普选已经举行，全国的选民已充分行使了他们的民主权利。从民生方面来看，封建主义早已消灭，私营工商业已经变为公私合营企业。由于社会主义建设突飞猛进，我们的工农业都很发达。今年钢的产量要超过一千零七十万吨，现在全国人民正为完成这个计划而奋斗。今年粮食也是大丰收，估计每人平均可有粮食一千斤以上。在科学方面，我们也有飞跃的进步。科学家们进行和平利用原子能的研究有很大成绩，原子反应堆已经建成。全国人民的生活，较之解放以前已经大大改善，并正在逐步提高。孙中山先生的革命主张，早在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，彻底实现，而且大大超过和发展了。真可以说是民族独立了，民权伸张了，民生改善了。我个人感到万分安慰和满意。我想，凡是孙中山先生的真正革命信徒，也一定同我一样感觉到欢欣鼓舞。
  但是，反过来，每念到祖国领土台湾尚未解放，那里有不少同胞依人篱下，饱受压迫蹂躏的痛苦，我又深为惋惜。
    孙中山先生在遗嘱中告诉我们：他致力国民革命凡四十年，其目的在求中国之自由平等。中山先生的这个崇高的目标，已经由于中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的诞生而实现了。但是，谁都知道，今天的台湾，在美帝国主义的蹂躏之下，正所谓不见天日。美帝国主义把魔爪伸到台湾，对台湾的同胞，当然不可能以自由平等相待。我还记得，孙中山先生生前，常常提到要“联合被压迫民族，共同奋斗，反抗帝国主义”。他对印度、印尼、缅甸的民族独立运动，也十分关心，十分同情。三十多年过去了。现在，不但我们伟大的祖国早已推翻了帝国主义的压迫，巍然屹立于世界之上；而且，印度、印尼、缅甸也已经摆脱帝国主义的压迫，成为民族独立的国家。遗憾的是，我们伟大祖国不可分割的一部分——台湾，现在还没有解放，美帝国主义者侵占了台湾，并且正在进一步想把它沦为美国的殖民地。美帝国主义者不仅控制了台湾的政治，亦控制了台湾的军事、经济和文化。同时，大家知道，孙中山先生在遗嘱中，特别强调“取消不平等条约”。在我们新中国，这早已不成问题了。但是，在祖国一部分领土的台湾，美国还以种种借口和台湾当局非法签订了一些不平等条约，加紧对台湾的控制。对于这种情况，现在台湾的一切具有民族觉悟和爱国心的人，能不感到痛心吗？至于说到民生问题，台湾的丰富资源，正受着美国垄断资本家的无餍的掠夺。台湾的经济要受美帝国主义的控制，无从发展，人民生活十分困苦。这不是同解决民生问题完全背道而驰吗？而且，尤其令人痛心者是台湾许多工业生活用品要依赖美国供应。于是美帝国主义一只手给你们剩余物资，一只手就给你们戴上锁链。台湾越依赖美国，美国对台湾的控制就越厉害，这正是台湾当前的实际情况。凡有民族自尊心的中华儿女，就真的甘心这样备受屈辱吗？美帝国主义者只相信忠顺于它的奴才，而对于稍有民族意识的人，则一律怀疑排斥。孙立人反蒋事件的暴露，正充分说明美国阴谋扶植亲美派系，利用它一手制造的奴才来作美国帮凶，以便进一步把台湾完全控制起来，归它支配。
    帝国主义就是帝国主义。孙中山先生的民族主义是同美帝的殖民主义完全对立的。美帝国主义控制台湾，正是想在台湾实现它的殖民政策，怎么会让你“实行民族主义”呢？美帝国主义更害怕孙中山先生的民权主义，因为如果台湾同胞的权力伸张了，对美帝国主义就不利了。美帝国主义这个台湾的“太上皇”，是绝对不会允许它“宝座”下的台湾人民享有真正的“民权”的。美帝国主义也不愿意孙中山先生的民生主义在台湾实现，因为民生主义的最终目的，是发展经济。要是台湾真的实现了民生主义，那美帝国主义岂不是再无从施展它的经济侵略了吗？
    台湾当局“要实行孙中山先生的三民主义”的唯一先决条件，就必须反抗美帝国主义，不摆脱美帝国主义的控制，是根本谈不到民族主义、民权主义、民生主义的。
    过去与我一起在孙中山先生领导之下从事革命事业、同过甘苦、共过患难的老朋友，我十分怀念你们！你们处于台湾一岛，诵读孙中山先生遗嘱中“求中国之自由平等”以及“取消不平等条约”之句，静夜三思，抚今追昔，能不痛心乎？若长此以往，必难免受后人责备。这些，也许用不着我来多说，但是我为爱护你们的前途，所以恳切希望你们及时猛醒！
    孙中山先生一生百折不挠为革命奋斗，反对清廷君主专制，反对袁世凯，反对帝国主义，他为了要把中国建设成为一个真正能够实行他所首倡的三民主义的国家，他在1924年坚决改组中国国民党，实行联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策。中国要“求自由平等”，要反抗帝国主义，只有联俄、联共、扶助农工才有出路。中苏两国都有辽阔的土地和丰富的资源，两国人民都为同样的理想而奋斗。这两个大国的团结互助，不仅可以保证两国的繁荣富强，而且也是维护世界和平的力量泉源。今天我们已经实现了孙中山先生的理想，同伟大的苏联结成巩固的同盟。他若死而有知，亦有所安慰。我是孙中山先生遗嘱的见证人之一。孙中山先生临终前早就洞察国民党中有一些人是会违背三大政策，是会被敌人软化的，所以在弥留之时，又谆谆嘱咐汪精卫：“我死之后，四面都是敌人，你们千万不要被敌人软化。”汪精卫说：“我们要是这样被敌人软化，就不革命了。”谁知后来汪精卫真的被敌人所软化，可见孙中山先生有先见之明。孙中山先生临终还有致苏联遗书，里面说到：“我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”他在遗嘱签字之后，还特别对我连呼三声：“廖仲恺夫人”，我立即体会到孙先生临终还叫着仲恺名字，意思就是勉励大家同志真正要忠实于孙中山先生的革命精神，就是必须实行三大政策，抵抗帝国主义，否则一定要被敌人软化，最后就会违背孙先生，因此我马上回答他：“先生放心，我们一定坚持改组国民党的精神，实行三大政策，抵抗帝国主义，以及爱护孙夫人，海枯石烂，不会忘记。”他紧握我的手说：“我感谢你。”最后，连呼“和平、奋斗、救中国”数声，溘然长逝。我们今日纪念孙中山先生，要深切体会他临终一刻，还念念不忘改组中国国民党的精神，坚守三大政策的苦心，要毋负他临终时的嘱咐。
    正如彭德怀部长在告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书中所说：中国人自己的事，应该由中国人自己解决。一时难于解决，可以从长商议。现在这个时代，是一个充满希望的时代，一切爱国者都有出路，不要怕什么帝国主义。应该化敌为友，一致对外，粉碎美帝制造两个中国的阴谋。我们都是中国人，和为贵。人孰无过，过而改之，可重新团结。自孙中山先生和廖仲恺逝世以后，两党两经分离，两经合作，又转眼三十多年。为今之计，化敌为友，言归于好，为子孙万代幸福着想，重新合作，此其时矣！祖国正在进行伟大的社会主义建设事业，和谈的大门正向着你们大开。作为一个孙中山先生的三民主义奉行者，首先应该是一个热烈的爱国者。一己的利益可以牺牲，而国家民族的利益决不能丝毫受损。六亿五千万中国人民的利益，是我们子子孙孙永远的利益。我们不可为仇者快，为亲者痛。当机立断，请你们不必疑虑了。
    我年纪已老，所能贡献与你们大家的仅止于此。
    爱国主义万岁！
    祖国万岁！
