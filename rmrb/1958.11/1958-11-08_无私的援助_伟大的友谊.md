Selfless Assistance, Great Friendship

Gifting Us Three Thousand Stallions

To help our country's animal husbandry develop rapidly, the Soviet Union has successively transported more than three thousand fine stallions to our country. These stallions, raised in various places, have been mating with Chinese horses for years and have already bred more than one hundred and fifty thousand improved horses.

The three thousand Soviet stallions include heavy draft, riding, and dual-purpose breeds. For example, the Ardennes, Vladimir, and Soviet Heavy Draft horses can pull vehicles weighing over ten tons in short distances. The Don, Orlov, and Kabardin breeds, which are both riding and draft horses, are world-renowned for their stamina. They can travel thousands of kilometers for dozens of days without fatigue in tests. The Thoroughbred riding horse can run one kilometer per minute and is the fastest horse breed in the world.

The Soviet Union has also continuously sent animal husbandry experts to help our country establish pastures and run artificial insemination technology training classes. With the help of Soviet experts, the level of artificial insemination technology has improved rapidly. In Nong'an County, Jilin Province, one stallion inseminated 1,200 mares this year, reaching an advanced international level.

At the Beijing Film Studio

Not long ago, a Soviet expert team led by the famous film studio design and technology expert Podgorov came to Beijing. They brought drawings and technological standards from various Soviet film studios and enthusiastically joined the entire design work of the Beijing Film Studio.

In order to design a Beijing Film Studio that has both world-class standards and suits China's needs, Soviet experts earnestly implemented China's socialist construction policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results during the design process. In order to find an ideal site, expert Podgorov and others personally surveyed more than thirty locations. In order to make the studio's "overall layout" and "elevation design" suitable for Chinese conditions, the architectural expert Mikhailovich revised his design more than ten times continuously. Electrical expert Vanigodov, in order to manufacture an important power supply equipment suitable for China's current situation, braved the mid-July heat to delve into the workshops of some motor factories in Shanghai and discussed and designed with the Chinese comrades in the factories. Air conditioning expert Daponin also personally went to Shenyang to select equipment. In order to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the experts often tirelessly changed the long-used standard designs. For example, the Chinese designers proposed using a prestressed structure for the catwalk in the studio, which has not yet been used in film studios around the world. This suggestion received strong support from Soviet experts. This item alone can save 120 tons of steel.

Soviet experts not only care about the construction of this one factory, but also care about the development of China's entire film industry. When Soviet experts saw in Chinese newspapers the news that a large number of simple film studios would be built throughout the country, they took the initiative to make design plans for local simple film studios for the reference of our cultural departments.

Investigation of Subtropical Biology

The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Sciences have been conducting comprehensive investigations of tropical and subtropical biology in minority areas of Yunnan for four years. The Soviet Union has successively sent twenty-six experts in zoology, botany, forestry, and microclimatology to our country to participate in this work.

During the four-year investigation, Chinese and Soviet experts discovered more than one hundred species of plants that had not been recorded in our country in the past and captured our country's first batch of wild cattle (three). They clarified the various situations related to lac insects and their parasitic plants, laying a scientific foundation for the development of lac production. They understood Yunnan's natural conditions and proposed directions for utilizing tropical and subtropical biological resources. On the eve of the October Revolution, another group of Soviet experts came to Kunming, preparing to study the dialectical relationship of the mutual influence of various natural factors in tropical areas.

In those days and nights in the tropical forest, Chinese and Soviet experts established close friendships. There was a pair of old experts in the expedition team who were born in the same year, both born on September 20, 1901. The Chinese expert was named Liu Chongle, and the Soviet expert was named Popov. In their work, they pondered day and night and studied together. Now Popov has returned to the Soviet Union, and the two still have frequent correspondence. On September 20th this year, both received congratulatory telegrams from each other. Liu Chongle told reporters: As the saying goes, we miss our loved ones even more during the holidays. I always feel uneasy if I don't greet my Soviet friend of the same age during the New Year's and holidays. The October Revolution is coming again, and I miss Popov again.

Sixteen years ago, Soviet doctor Andrei Arlov enthusiastically supported the health and medical cause of our people, treating and saving many patients, women in labor, and infants. Yang Defu, a farmer in Xiaobian Gou Village, Yan'an, and Gao Xingde, a farmer in Zaoyuan Village, named their children "Yuansheng" and "Yuancheng" respectively to commemorate the kindness of Yan'an Central Hospital and Dr. Arlov.

    无私的援助　伟大的友谊
    赠我种马三千匹
    为了帮助我国畜牧业迅速发展，苏联先后运送给我国的优良种马目前已达三千多匹。这些分散各地饲养的种马连年来同中国马交配，已经繁殖十五万多匹改良马。
    三千多匹苏联种马包括重挽、骑乘和乘挽兼用三类。如阿尔登·富拉基米和苏维埃重挽马，在短距离内能拉载重十吨以上的车子。乘挽兼用的顿河、奥洛夫和卡巴金，是世界上有名的好马，它们的持久力很强，在测验中经几十天走几千公里都不疲劳。骑乘型的纯血马，一分钟能跑一公里，是世界上速度最快的马种。
    苏联连年来还不断派来畜牧专家，帮助我国建立牧场，开办人工授精技术训练班。在苏联专家帮助下，人工授精技术水平提高很快。吉林省农安县有一匹种公马今年配了一千二百匹母马，达到了国际先进水平。
    在北京电影制片厂
    不久前，一个以著名电影厂设计工艺专家波德戈夫为首的苏联专家组来到了北京。他们带来了苏联各电影制片厂的图纸和工艺标准，热情地投入了北京电影制片厂的全部设计工作。
    为了设计出一个既具有世界先进水平又适合中国需要的北京电影制片厂，苏联专家在设计过程中认真贯彻了中国的多快好省的社会主义建设方针。为了寻找一个理想的厂址，波德戈夫专家等曾经亲自勘查过三十多个地点。为了使制片厂的“总平面处理”和“立面设计”适合中国情况，建筑专家米哈依洛维奇曾经连续十多次修改自己的设计。电力专家凡尼戈多夫为了制造出一种适合中国当前情况的供电用的重要设备，曾经冒着七月的盛暑深入上海一些电机厂的车间，和厂里的中国同志一起商讨、设计。空气调节专家达波宁也为了选择设备亲自跑到沈阳去。为了实现多快好省，专家们常常不厌其烦地改变习用已久的标准设计。如摄影棚的工作天桥，中国设计人员提出采用世界各国制片厂还未用过的预应力结构。这个建议得到苏联专家的大力支持。仅此一项就可以节省钢材一百二十吨。
    苏联专家不仅关心这一个厂的建设，而且关心中国整个电影事业的发展。当苏联专家们看到中国报纸上刊载全国各地将大量兴办简易制片厂的消息以后，就主动地作出地方简易电影制片厂的设计方案，交给我国文化部门参考。
    考察亚热带生物
    中国科学院和苏联科学院在云南少数民族地区对热带和亚热带生物的综合考察工作已经进行了四年了。苏联先后派遣了二十六名动物、植物、森林、小气候学专家来我国参加这个工作。
    在长达四年的考察中，中苏专家们发现了一百多种过去我国没有记载过的植物，捉住了我国的第一批野牛（三只）。调查清楚了有关紫胶虫及其寄生植物的各种情况，为发展紫胶生产打下了科学的基础。摸清了云南的自然条件，提出了利用热带和亚热带生物资源的方向。在十月革命节前夕，又一批苏联专家来到了昆明，准备研究在热带地区各个自然因素相互影响的辩证关系。
    在热带森林里的那些个日日夜夜里，中国和苏联的专家们建立了亲密的友情。考察队里有一对同庚生的老专家，他们都是在1901年9月20日生的，中国的专家叫刘崇乐，苏联专家叫波波夫。在工作中他们日夜琢磨，共同研究。现在波波夫已经回到苏联去了，两人的书信来往仍然很密。今年9月20日，两个人都收到了彼此祝寿的电报。刘崇乐告诉记者说：俗话说，每逢佳节倍思亲，过年过节不问候一下我那苏联同庚生的朋友，心里总是放不下，十月革命节又到了，我又思念起波波夫来。（以上据新华社稿）（附图片）
    十六年前，苏联医生安德烈·阿洛夫热忱支援我国人民的卫生医疗事业，医治和救活了许多病人和产妇、婴孩。延安小砭沟村农民杨德福、枣园村农民高兴德为了纪念延安中央医院和阿洛夫医生的恩情，分别把自己的小孩取名为“院生”、“院成”。
