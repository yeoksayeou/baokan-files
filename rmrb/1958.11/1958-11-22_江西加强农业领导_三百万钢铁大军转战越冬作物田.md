    Jiangxi Strengthens Agricultural Leadership
    Three Million Steel Troops Switch to Winter Crop Fields
    (Our report) After overfulfilling the annual pig iron production plan on the 15th of this month, the three million steel warriors of Jiangxi immediately rushed to the province's 25 million mu of winter crop fields to carry out battles such as topdressing, weeding, checking seedlings, and replanting for oilseed rape, wheat, barley, and red clover (green manure).
    In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of agricultural production this winter and next spring, the Provincial Party Committee recently decided that, in addition to keeping 15-20% of the labor force fixed on the steel front to continue fighting, the remaining 80-85% of the labor force should be transferred to agriculture.
    In Linchuan County, more than a hundred cadres from the Fenggang People's Commune, having just finished their command tasks on the steel front, formed three inspection corps to go deep into the fields to check each plot and section, make detailed appraisals, register by category, classify teams, and quickly mobilize forces to engage in seedling transplanting and replanting, as well as shock topdressing to promote seedling growth. The Hongxing Brigade of the Hunan People's Commune checked over 100 mu of planted oilseed rape and immediately applied water fertilizer and plant ash, turning the seedlings green again.
    In organizing professional teams and large-scale corps operations, various localities have also universally adopted a responsibility system that goes to the very end. Fixed personnel are responsible, and the methods of fixing the field, fixing the person, fixing the work, fixing the quality, fixing the quantity, and guaranteeing seedling emergence, thinning, setting seedlings, rational fertilization, and yield are implemented. This strengthens the responsibility of the commune members, improves management quality, and accelerates the speed. Up to now, various parts of the province have generally applied fertilizer once or twice and weeded once, and have replanted any missing or sparse seedlings, and have universally strengthened frost and cold prevention work.
    At present, various crops are generally growing strong, lush, and lovely. Farmers are happily carrying out various management activities. (Zhang Zizhong)

    江西加强农业领导
    三百万钢铁大军转战越冬作物田
    本报讯　在本月15日超额完成了全年生铁生产计划后，江西三百多万钢铁战士，立刻奔向了全省两千五百多万亩冬季作物田，对油菜、大小麦、红花草（绿肥）等，展开了追肥、锄草、查苗、补苗等战斗。
    为了加强对今冬明春农业生产的组织领导，省委最近决定除以15—20％劳动力固定在钢铁战线坚持战斗外，其余80—85％的劳动力都转到农业方面来。
    临川县凤岗人民公社百多名干部刚刚结束了钢铁战线的指挥任务，就组成了三个检查兵团，深入田间逐丘逐段的检查，精细鉴定，划片登记，分类站队，火速的调动了力量，投入移苗补苗，突击追肥催苗。湖南人民公社红星大队检查了种下的一百多亩油菜，就立即追施了水肥、草木灰，使幼苗还青。
    各地在组织专业队和大兵团作战中，还普遍采取一竿子插到底的责任制度，固定专人负责，实行定田、定人、定工、定质、定量和包出苗、包间苗、定苗、包合理施肥、包产量的办法，加强了社员的责任心，提高了管理质量，加快了速度。到目前为止，全省各地一般都施过一两次肥和锄了一遍草，对缺苗少兜的都进行了补栽，并且普遍的加强了防霜防冻工作。
    现在各种作物普遍生长茁壮，葱绿可爱，农民们正在欢天喜地的进行各种管理活动。　（张自忠）
