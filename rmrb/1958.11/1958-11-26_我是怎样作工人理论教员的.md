How I Became a Worker-Theorist Instructor
Xu Dongqin

I am a fine yarn worker in the JiaMusI Textile Factory's yarn workshop, Class A. I have been working for five years since I entered the factory in 1953.

Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for building socialism, the entire staff of Class A in our yarn workshop, like the people of the whole country, have launched a high tide of studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong, while at the same time production is leaping forward. In our Class A alone, more than twenty communist schools have been established. Workers take time out of their busy schedules to study theory, but there are many things they don't understand and can't learn, and they urgently need someone to help. At that time, the Youth League secretary mobilized me to be a theory instructor. Oh dear! My heart leaped when I heard that. How could I do that? I have neither education nor theory. At that time, I was very timid and didn't agree. Later, the Party committee talked to me several times, asking me to break with superstition, emancipate my mind, study hard myself, and help my fellow workers to study at the same time. I struggled ideologically for several days, and finally figured it out. I am a member of the Communist Youth League, I should study Marxism-Leninism well, and I also have the responsibility to promote Marxism-Leninism. Give off a bit of light and heat. Now that socialism is leaping forward, everyone is working hard and practically, and I can't fall behind. If you don't understand much, you should study. If you don't study, how can you improve? When I thought of this, I got excited and my courage grew, so I agreed!

I have given three lessons since I became a theory instructor. The first lesson was on the first lecture of "Introduction" in the "Basic Knowledge of Philosophy" textbook. The second lesson was on the issue of two types of contradictions. The third lesson was a guiding speech on studying the Red Flag magazine. Because I had never been an instructor before, I was groping my way. To tell you the truth, I took a detour!

When I gave the first lesson, I followed the "Basic Knowledge of Philosophy" textbook. The situation at that time was like this: The workers in Room 28 each bought a copy of the "Basic Knowledge of Philosophy" textbook for studying philosophy, and everyone buried their heads in it, reading it over and over again. Some people couldn't understand it. They asked me to teach it. When I looked at the first lecture of the "Basic Knowledge of Philosophy" textbook, I listed three outlines: ① What is philosophy? ② Why should we study philosophy? ③ How to study philosophy? I spent a lot of effort reading the introduction thoroughly, and also wrote a lecture script. On the day of the lecture, I was sweating profusely, explaining it to them sentence by sentence, over and over again. After finally finishing the lecture, I asked, "Did you understand?" A few people vaguely said they understood. Some people just stared at me blankly. Some people said to me with gratitude and embarrassment, "Little Xu, are you tired? Take a break." After class, I individually talked to a few workers to see how they were learning. I asked, "What is philosophy?" Some said, "Philosophy is the study of world outlook, that is to say, it is people's general view or system of views on everything in the world." Ah, they memorized it exactly like the textbook, not even a single word wrong. However, some people couldn't memorize it, saying things like: Each country has its own philosophy... etc. When I saw this, I knew something was wrong. They said they understood, but they didn't actually understand. It turned out they were afraid of undermining my confidence in being an instructor, so they said that. What was the reason? At that time, I thought, was it because I didn't prepare enough, didn't explain in detail, and didn't put in enough effort? Or was it for other reasons? After considering it, I thought that I had prepared the lesson carefully and explained it sentence by sentence, and I had put in enough effort, so the reason was not here. I thought the main thing was that I didn't implement the policy of combining theory with practice put forward by Chairman Mao. I explained too many concepts, and sometimes I didn't even know what I was talking about. That "Basic Knowledge of Philosophy" textbook is supposed to be easy to understand, but it was still difficult for us to read. It seemed that teaching philosophy according to this book would be difficult, and I had to find another way.

At this time, our factory was carrying out the struggle against bad elements. Secretary Dong made a report. When the workers discussed Secretary Dong's report, they discussed a lot of things. What is the difference between contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy? What kind of contradiction is a thief? Are there any bad elements in our workshop? Everyone had different opinions. At that time, I worked with the principal and director of the communist school to study how to help the workers learn about the issue of two types of contradictions in coordination with the current struggle against bad elements. This is also philosophical study, and it is a very realistic and vivid philosophy lesson. My second lecture started under this situation.

In order to give this lesson well, I learned about the ideological situation of some workers in the struggle against bad elements. I originally worked in Class A of the yarn workshop, and I knew some of the workers' ideological situation, but I felt that it was not down-to-earth, so I studied it with the cadres of the communist school. The general situation was grasped. But I felt that it was not enough, so I consciously exchanged opinions with a few workers individually. The workers had many opinions. Some said, "There are no bad elements in our workshop, only a few backward elements, nothing great." Some said: Someone usually grumbles a few words, it's nothing. Some said, "Anyway, I'm not a bad element, it has nothing to do with me whether I fight bad elements or not"... Although there were many opinions, in summary, there was only one question: They couldn't distinguish between two different types of contradictions. Based on this situation, I worked with the school cadres to put forward several central questions: ① What are the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy? ② What are the contradictions among the people? ③ What attitude should we take towards these two different types of contradictions? Give them to the workers for debate. At that time, we did this for three purposes: ① Through debate, improve understanding and achieve the purpose of self-education. ② Through debate, discover problems, grasp the focus, and lay the foundation for future lectures. ③ Through debate, promote the communist style of daring to think and speak among the workers. This debate was very lively. It was originally scheduled for two hours, but it lasted for half a day. The expected purpose of the debate was achieved. Through debate, some problems were solved. For example, those who used to think that the bad elements' remarks were "backward words" now realized the anti-Party and anti-socialist nature of these reactionary remarks, and realized that bad elements are our enemies, not a problem within the people. Although some problems have not yet reached a consensus, the focus of the debate is even more obvious. For example, there are two opinions on the understanding of thieves: One opinion is that all theft of state property is a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy, and all theft of personal property is a contradiction among the people. The other opinion is that habitual thieves who repeatedly fail to reform are contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and general petty thieves who commit the crime for the first time and can reform after education belong to the contradictions among the people. The debate made very important preparations for my lesson preparation and lectures.

Under this situation, I started preparing for the lesson, writing outlines, looking for reference books, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People", and finally wrote the lecture script. To be cautious, I worked with the principal and director of the communist school to study the lecture script, and made revisions based on their opinions. The lecture script was finalized!

This lecture was not as dry as the first one. The lecture systematically summarized all the issues debated in the debate. It affirmed the correct opinions and criticized the incorrect opinions. Combined with these specific issues, it explained the six criteria for distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds put forward by Chairman Mao. When I talked about the issue of thieves, I criticized the view that "stealing public things is a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy, and stealing personal things is a contradiction among the people." Because the two types of contradictions cannot be distinguished according to the object of stealing, but should be distinguished according to the six criteria put forward by Chairman Mao, to see whether it seriously harms the interests of the working people and the interests of socialist construction, and whether it undermines the socialist order and harms the system of people's democratic dictatorship. Here, I focused on analyzing the issue of a worker who beat someone to death for stealing things, and criticized the view that "he beat someone to death for stealing things, but it can't be considered a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy", pointing out that although he came from the working class, he was deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology, greedy for money and harming people's lives, degenerating and betraying the working class, seriously endangering the people's property and personal safety, so his contradiction with us is already a problem between ourselves and the enemy. The workers suddenly realized this when they heard this. When I criticized the kind of analysis that does not use a class viewpoint to analyze problems, only looks at the superficial phenomena of people, and regards reactionary remarks as "backward words", I cited the understanding of a fellow worker to illustrate. This fellow worker used to admire a rightist very much, saying, "He is really energetic, a young man, talented, handsome, and enthusiastic to people. What does it matter if he grumbles a few words!" He was shocked when he saw the big-character poster saying he was a rightist. The workers all laughed when they heard this. In this lecture, I also felt that I spoke happily and felt comfortable in my heart.

After the lecture, some groups organized discussions. I also participated in their discussions, talking about my feelings and debating issues with them.

Through this study, the workers gained a lot. First of all, they improved their understanding. For example, Fan Yukun said, "This time I have drawn a clear line. I used to think that there were no bad elements in the fine yarn workshop, even if there were a few individual figures, they were just backward elements, who like to complain, nothing great. Through this debate and the instructor's lecture, I realized what kind of person is considered a bad element." Han Xuegeng was originally a trade union group leader, but he was unwilling to do trade union work, and his relationship with his comrades was not good. Through this study, he improved his understanding, took charge of trade union work, and his relationship with his comrades improved. For another example, Li Guangfa improved his awareness through study, and actively confessed some of the mistakes he had made in the past to the organization, and his enthusiasm for production was also high. Secondly, the workers' positions were also more firm. For example, at the beginning of the struggle against bad elements, many workers held the idea that it had nothing to do with them. They did not speak at the struggle meeting. After studying, they actively participated in the struggle at the struggle meeting. Again, it is reflected in production, and their enthusiasm is even greater. In the past, they complained when they had to pick up the machine, and if they did a little more work. Now they turn at high speed, speed up production, and eat without stopping the machine. The workers have no objection, but work hard without complaint. After finishing work during the day, they also participate in voluntary labor in the evening, and they are not willing to fall behind in various movements. Of course, the achievement of these achievements is multifaceted, but the workers' thoughts have been inserted with red flags through theoretical study, and there is no doubt that it is one of the main reasons.

Although I have not been a theory instructor for a very long time, I have a deep understanding: Being a worker-theorist instructor is not mysterious. As long as you break with superstition, emancipate your mind, study and research hard, dare to think and act under the leadership of the Party, don't be discouraged when you run into problems, listen to the opinions of your fellow workers with humility, and learn and improve as you go, you will definitely become a very good theory instructor in the future.

    我是怎样作工人理论教员的
    徐东琴
    我是佳木斯纺织厂纱厂甲班细纱工人。从1953年入厂到现在，已经工作了五年。
    我们纱厂甲班的全体职工，在党建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下和全国人民一样，在生产跃进的同时，又掀起了一个学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的高潮。仅我们甲班就建立了二十几个共产主义学校。工人们在百忙中抽时间学习理论，但有很多地方看不明白，学不懂，非常需要有人帮助。当时团支书动员我当理论教员。啊呀！我一听心里就跳起来了，我怎么行，既没文化，又没理论，当时我很胆虚，没答应。以后党委找我谈了几次话，要我破除迷信，解放思想，自己努力学习，同时帮助工友们学习。我思想斗争了好几天，终于想通了。我是一个共青团员，我应该学好马列主义，也有责任宣传马列主义。有一分热发一分光，现在社会主义大跃进，人人都苦干实干，我也不能落后呀。懂的不多就应该学，不学，怎么能提高呢。我想到这里，劲就来了，胆量也大了，就答应下来啦！
    从我作理论教员，到现在已讲过三次课了。第一课讲的是哲学常识读本第一讲“序论”。第二课讲的是两类矛盾问题。第三课是学习红旗杂志的辅导发言。因为我过去没当过教员，是摸索着干的，说起来，我还走了一段弯路哩！
    我讲第一课是按着哲学常识读本来讲的。当时的情况是这样：二十八室的工友们因为学习哲学每人买了一本哲学常识读本，个个埋着头看，看了一遍又一遍，有些人看不懂。他们就要我去讲，我一看哲学常识读本第一讲序论，就列了三个题纲：①什么是哲学？②为什么要学哲学？③怎样学习哲学？费了好大的劲把序论读熟了，还写了讲稿。讲课的那天，我累得满头大汗，一句一句的反来复去的讲给他们听。好容易讲完了，我就问：“听懂了没有”？有几个人含含糊糊的说听懂了。有一些人直呆呆的看着我。还有一些人很不好意思的带着感谢的口吻对我说：“小徐，累啦吧？快休息休息。”下课以后，我就个别的找了几个工友谈谈，看他们学的怎样。我问：“什么是哲学？”有的说：“哲学是关于世界观的学问，也就是说，它是人们对于世界一切事物的总的看法或观点的体系。”呵，背得和书本上的一模一样，连一个字也不错。但是，也有的人背不出来，说什么：每个国家有每个国家的哲学……等。我一看，不对头，他们嘴里说是听懂了，实际上没听懂，原来他们怕挫伤了我当教员的信心，才这么说的。什么原因呢？我当时就想，是我准备的不够，讲的不细致，用劲不够呢？还是别的原因？考虑的结果，我认为我是认真备了课的，而且是一句一句讲的，费的劲也够大，原因不在这里。我想主要是没有贯彻毛主席所提出的理论联系实际的方针。解释概念多，有时候我自己也不知道讲了些什么。那本哲学常识，按道理说是通俗的，可是对我们来说，读起来还是怪费劲的，看来，按这本书来讲哲学，够呛，得另想办法。
    这时我们厂子里正开展反坏分子的斗争。董书记作了报告，工友们在讨论董书记报告时议论纷纷，什么人民内部矛盾，敌我矛盾搞不清。小偷算什么矛盾？我们车间有没有坏分子？大家的说法不一。当时，我就和共产主义学校的校长、主任一块研究，配合当前反坏斗争应该帮助工友们学好两类矛盾的问题。这也是哲学学习，而且是很现实很生动的哲学课。我第二次讲课就是在这种情况下开始的。
    为了把这课讲好，就了解一些工友们在反坏斗争中的思想情况。我本来就在纱厂甲班干活，工友们的思想情况我是了解一些的，但我觉得还不落实，便和共产主义学校的干部们一起研究，总的情况是掌握了。但觉得还不够，于是我又有意识的各别的和几个工友交换了一下意见，工友们的看法很多。有的说：“咱们车间没啥坏分子，只有几个落后分子，没啥了不起。”有的说：谁谁平日好发几句牢骚，算不了啥。有的说：“反正我不是坏分子，反坏不反坏与我无关”……。说法虽然很多，但总起来看，实质上只有一个问题：分不清两种不同性质的矛盾。根据这种情况，我就和学校的干部们共同研究提出了几个中心问题：①什么是敌我矛盾？②什么是人民内部矛盾？③我们应该用什么态度来对待这两种性质不同的矛盾？交给工友们辩论。当时，我们这样作有三个目的：①通过辩论，提高认识，达到自我教育的目的。②通过辩论，发现问题，抓住焦点，为将来的讲课打下基础。③通过辩论，发扬工友们敢想敢说的共产主义风格。这次辩论得很热烈，原定两小时，可是一辩论就辩论了半天。辩论会预期的目的是达到啦。通过辩论，有些问题解决了。如过去认为坏分子的言论是“落后话”的那些人，现在已认识到了这些反动言论反党反社会主义的本质，认识到坏分子是我们的敌人，而不是人民内部的问题。有些问题虽然还没得出一致的认识来，但争论的焦点是更加明显啦。如对盗窃犯的认识有两种意见：一种意见认为凡是盗窃国家财产的都是敌我矛盾，凡是盗窃个人财产的都是人民内部矛盾。另一种意见认为屡教不改的惯盗是敌我矛盾，一般的小偷初犯经教育后，能改邪归正的都属于人民内部矛盾。辩论会给我备课和讲课作了很重要的准备。
    在这种情况下我开始备课啦，写题纲，找参考书，反复学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的文章，最后写出了讲稿。为了慎重起见，我和共产主义学校的校长、主任共同研究了讲稿，根据他们的意见作了修改，讲稿算定下来啦！
    这次讲课就不像第一次那么干巴啦，讲课中系统的总结了辩论会中所辩论的一切问题。肯定了正确的意见，批判了不正确的意见。结合着这些具体问题解释了毛主席所提出的辨别香花和毒草的六条标准。当我讲到盗窃犯问题时，批判了那种认为“偷公家东西是敌我矛盾，偷个人东西是人民内部矛盾”的说法。因为区别两类矛盾不能按偷东西的对象来区别，而应该按毛主席提出的六条标准来区别，看它是不是严重的危害了劳动人民的利益和社会主义建设的利益，是不是破坏了社会主义秩序危害了人民民主专政的制度。在这里我着重的就一个工人因偷东西而打死人的问题作了分析，批判了那种认为：“他虽然因偷人东西打死了人，也不能算敌我矛盾”的说法，指出他虽然出身于工人阶级，但因他深受资产阶级思想影响，贪财害命，蜕化变质，背叛了工人阶级，严重的危害了人民财产与生命安全，所以他和我们的矛盾已经是敌我问题了。工人们听到这里才恍然大悟。当我批判那种不用阶级观点分析问题，只看人的表面现象，把反动言论当作“落后话”的认识时，我举出了一个工友同志的认识来说明，这个工友同志过去很崇拜一个右派分子，说“他真带劲呀，年轻小伙，有才，漂亮，对人又热情，就是发几句牢骚有什么关系呀！”一见大字报说他是右派，才大吃一惊。工友们听到这里都哈哈的笑了。在这次讲课中我自己也感到讲的痛快，心里舒坦。
    讲完课后，有一些小组组织了座谈。我也参加了他们的座谈会。和他们一起谈感想，辩论问题。
    通过这次学习，工友们的收获很大。首先提高了认识。如范玉坤说：“这回我可划清界限啦，以前我以为细纱车间那有坏分子呢，就是有几个个别人物也不过是落后分子，好发牢骚，没啥了不起。通过这次辩论和教员讲课我才认识到什么人算坏分子。”韩学庚原是工会小组长，但不愿作工会工作，和同志的关系也不好，通过这次学习提高了认识，工会工作负责啦，同志关系也好啦。再如李广发通过学习提高了觉悟，主动的向组织交代了过去所犯的一些错误问题，生产上的积极性也高啦。其次，工友们的立场也更加坚定了。例如在反坏斗争开始时，许多工友抱着与己无关的思想，斗争会上不发言，学习后，在斗争会上都积极的参加了斗争。再次，表现在生产上，干劲也更大了，过去挑机台，干活稍多些就发牢骚，现在高速度回转，加快生产，吃饭不停车，工友们也没意见，反而任劳任怨的埋头劳动。白天干完活晚上还要参加义务劳动，在各项运动中都不甘落后。当然，这些成绩的取得是多方面的，但是通过理论学习，工友们的思想上插上了红旗，毫无疑问，是其中的主要原因之一。
    我当理论教员的时间虽然还不很长，但我有一点很深的体会：作工人理论教员并不神秘。只要破除迷信，解放思想，努力学习和钻研，在党的领导下敢想敢干，碰了钉子不灰心，虚心听取工友们的意见，边干边学边提高，将来就一定能成为一个很好的理论教员。
