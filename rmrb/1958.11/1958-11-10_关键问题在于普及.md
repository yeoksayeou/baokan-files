    The Key Problem Lies in Popularization
    Wu Jiang
    To eliminate ignorance and enlighten people's wisdom, philosophy must be popularized – this is a problem that Comrade Mao Zedong raised early in his revolutionary activities. However, some people only see or emphasize that philosophy is a more advanced ideological system, and do not see or appropriately emphasize the popular nature of philosophy. Philosophy, precisely because it has the greatest generality, also has greater popularity and universal applicability. The more advanced something is, the more popular it is at the same time.
    The key problem at present lies in popularization. Our improvement work needs a foundation of popularization (the past shortcoming was the lack of this foundation), and our specialists also need to be cultivated or re-trained in popularization work. For specialists to devote themselves to popularization work, first, they must participate in labor and various struggle practices, which may greatly change their mental state. Second, whether philosophy can be popularized well depends entirely on whether philosophy can be applied in practical work. This forces philosophy to proceed from reality and earnestly solve the problem of linking theory with practice. Third, drawing nourishment from the masses, using the experience of the vast number of popularization workers, and summarizing the practical experience of personal participation may lead to real and reliable improvements.
    Our ranks should be expanded on the basis of popularization work. Can we stipulate that anyone who is to be trained as a professional philosophy worker, such as those studying philosophy in various schools, should pass the test of popularization work and have experience in popularizing philosophy among the masses in order to be qualified? Should every philosophy working agency, philosophy worker, including philosophy magazines, undertake certain popularization tasks, or under the leadership of the Party, undertake popularization work in a certain area? In the next few years, can some philosophical associations and research societies make popularization work one of their main agendas? Is it also possible to directly organize philosophical popularization associations and absorb popularization workers emerging from the masses to participate? As for summarizing the experience of popularization work up to now, in order to plan future work, this is urgently needed.

    关键问题在于普及
    吴江
    要扫除愚昧，启发人们的智慧，非普及哲学不可，——这是毛泽东同志早在他革命活动初期便提出了的问题。但是，有人总是只看到或只强调哲学是更高级的思想体系这一面，而没有看到或没有适当强调哲学的普及性这一面。哲学，唯其具有最大的概括性，所以也就具有更大的普及性和普遍适用性。更高级的东西，同时也是更普及的东西。
    目前关键问题在于普及。我们的提高工作需要有普及的基础（过去的缺点就在于没有这个基础），我们的专门工作者也需要到普及工作中去培养或重新锻炼。专门家投身于普及工作，第一，必须参加到劳动和各种斗争实践中去，这就有可能极大地改变自己的精神状态。第二，能否做好哲学普及工作，全在于能否在实际工作中运用哲学。这就迫使哲学必须从实际出发，认真解决理论联系实际问题。第三，从群众中吸收养料，利用广大普及工作者的经验，总结自己亲自参加的实践经验，这就可能有真正的、切实可靠的提高。
    我们的队伍应当在普及工作的基础上扩大。是否可以规定这样一条：凡是要训练成为哲学专业工作者的，例如在各种学校中学哲学的人，都应当过普及工作这一关，具有在群众中普及哲学的经验，方为合格。每一个哲学工作机关、哲学工作者，包括哲学杂志在内，是不是都应当担负一定的普及任务，或者在党的领导下担负一个地区的普及工作。一些哲学协会和研究会，在若干年内，是不是可以把普及工作提为主要工作日程之一？径直地组织哲学普及协会，吸收从群众中涌现出来的普及工作者参加，是不是也可以？至于直到目前为止的普及工作经验应当加以总结，借以策划今后的工作，则是迫切需要做的。
