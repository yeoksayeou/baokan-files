Visiting Hecuo Village
Xia Jingfan

We arrived at Hecuo Village filled with respect and excitement for its heroic people.

Soon after arriving in Xiamen, we heard many heroic stories of fighting the enemy and supporting the front lines in this frontline village:

Communist Youth League member Lin Zhongming, while using a water-drawing irrigation device in the fields, had his pole broken three times by enemy shells. Each time, he immediately repaired it and continued drawing water, saying, "Chiang Kai-shek, that idiot, thinks my water-drawing pole is a cannon! Okay, I'll install another one!"

Young woman Lin Biqiong, during the artillery battles, volunteered to help the artillerymen boil water. When she went to the well to fetch water, enemy shells exploded not far from her, she immediately got up and continued carrying water.

Party Branch Secretary He Jiangping was always present in the most urgent and dangerous situations, and whenever there were arduous tasks. He braved the rain while ill to repair the national defense highway that had been washed away by the flood. The flood was so rapid that the thrown soil and stones could not stop the breach. He and Communist Party members He Yunzhou, He Minglei, and others jumped into the rapids without hesitation, using their bodies to block the flood, enabling the highway to be quickly repaired. ...

The day we arrived at the village, the weather was clear. Jinmen Island was clearly visible from five or six miles away from Hecuo. Standing on the coast near Hecuo Village, people with good eyesight could even faintly see the activities of enemy sentries. It is said that if the enemy had cars coming and going, the sound of the engines could even be heard. The people here were fighting the enemy almost face to face.

The village was full of enemy shell craters. Most of the houses had broken beams and collapsed walls, and some of the large trees had been blown in half. At first glance, the atmosphere of war enveloped this peaceful village. The elderly and children in the village had been evacuated to the rear, and the young men and women who remained here were very brave in the struggle against the enemy and in production. When I walked into some of the houses that had not been completely destroyed, I felt a fresh and powerful sensation. The goods in the supply and marketing cooperative were still complete. The salesman had just finished pouring vinegar for a teenager, and two girls came to buy sugar. The barber shop had been relocated to a large hall, and two female barbers were busy giving haircuts. The five cooks in the canteen were busy cutting vegetables and cooking. Arriving at the production team's office, the room was surrounded by people, and the table was filled with stacks of cash. Several people were clicking away on abacuses. It turned out that the Qianxian People's Commune had implemented a wage system in October, and this time Hecuo Village's Second Battalion distributed more than 2,800 yuan in wages.

Comrade He Jiangping, the Party Branch Secretary, led us to see the aquatic product farming site on the beach. Although the enemy had also fired many shells at this beach, it was neatly filled with oyster stones, even close to the deep water. He pointed to the opposite Little Jinmen and asked us to observe the enemy's movements. Comrade Jiangping said humorously, "If the seawater were a little shallower, we would put the oyster stones on Jinmen."

He also pointed to a depression near the seaside and said, "That's where our militiamen practice shooting." I looked at it and saw more than a dozen machine guns on the ground, with groups of militiamen crawling behind the machine guns, concentrating on taking turns practicing aiming. He said excitedly, "Our militiamen are not only production teams here, but also combat teams. They are on guard, producing, and training day and night. A few days ago, they learned to fire cannons from the artillerymen, and all of them learned from the first gunner to the fifth gunner." As the local folk song describes: "The militia are brave and fully armed, building a copper wall and an iron wall. Once the motherland blows the horn, they rush to the front line to protect the country."

In the militia of Hecuo Village, many are young women. Among the female militia are the famous Ten Sisters. They are girls from ten families who, in the struggle to support the front lines and fight the enemy, have the same will and action. They have formed sisters on the same post of supporting the front line struggle. The eldest of the Ten Sisters is twenty-three years old, and the youngest is only fifteen years old. Each of them has a gun, and they stand guard with their guns on their backs like men. They also rush to the People's Liberation Army positions to collect clothes for soldiers, helping them sew and wash. In more than two months, they have sewn and washed more than 3,000 pieces of clothing for the soldiers. When these ten girls are mentioned, the soldiers praise them with warmth and affection, just like praising their own sisters.

In this village, there are also the famous "Little Eighth Route Army." They are all Young Pioneers from Hecuo Elementary School, but they are also the "little logistics soldiers" of the troops. They help adults repair roads, wipe shells, and deliver boiling water, becoming good helpers for the PLA uncles. As we approached the school, we saw that the brick walls of the school were pitted with shrapnel, and the lime on the gable had been blown off. The teacher taught them in this room. The children were very quiet and worked hard on their exercises. After class, they rushed towards us, shouting crisply and affectionately: "Hello, hello!" He Danian wanted us to sit in his house, He Jiaru also wanted us to see her house, and Guo Shengyuan also wanted to go to the seaside to catch a few big crabs to entertain us.

There are endless heroic stories to tell and write about in Hecuo Village. What is recorded here is only a drop in the ocean. But from this drop, can't we also feel the pulse of the heroic people?

### 访何厝村

    访何厝村
    夏景凡
    我们满怀着对英雄人民的敬意和激越的心情来到何厝村。
    初到厦门，就听到这个最前沿的乡村里有许许多多对敌斗争和支援前线的英勇故事：
    共青团员林忠明，在吊水灌田中，吊竿被敌人炮弹打断三次，他都立刻把它修好，继续吊水。并说：“蒋介石这个笨蛋，把我的吊乌（即吊竿）当大炮了，好吧，我就再来安它一尊！”
    青年妇女林碧琼，在炮战中，自动去帮助炮兵烧开水，到井上打水时，敌人的炮弹在离她不太远的地方爆炸后，就立刻爬起来继续挑水。
    党总支书记何江萍，在最紧急的时候，最危险的地方，有什么艰巨任务，总有他在场。他带病冒雨抢修被洪水冲断的国防公路，洪水太急，抛下的泥土石头都挡不住缺口，他和共产党员何允宙、何明类等奋不顾身地跳入急流，用身体挡住洪水，使公路迅速修复。……
    我们到村子里的这天，天气晴朗，离何厝五六里路，就清楚的看到金门岛。站在何厝村边的海岸上，眼力好的人，还能隐约地看到敌人哨兵的活动，据说，要是敌人有汽车来往，连马达声也可以听见。这里的人民和敌人几乎是面对面的斗争了。
    村子里，遍地是敌人打的炮弹坑，大部分房屋打得断梁塌壁，有的大树也被打去半截。猛然一看，战争的气氛笼罩了这和平的村庄。村子上的老人和孩子都转移到后方去了，留在这里的男女青年，在对敌斗争和生产上，都是十分英勇的。当我走进一些未被完全打烂的房子里，真有一种新鲜有力的感觉。供销部的货物还是那样齐全，售货员刚给一个少年打完了醋，又来了两个买糖的姑娘。理发店改设在一大间堂屋里，两个女理发员正在忙着给人理发。食堂的五个炊事员正在忙着切菜做饭。来到生产队的办公处，屋里围着一些人，桌上摆满一叠叠现金，几个人铁咧哒啦的打算盘，原来前线人民公社从10月份实行工资制，这次何厝村二营共发工资二千八百多元。
    总支书记何江萍同志领我们去看海滩上的水产养殖场，敌人虽然也向这海滩上打了不少炮，但滩上甚至接近深水的地方却整齐地摆满了蚝石。他指着对面的小金门让我们察看敌人动静。江萍同志诙谐地说：“海水再小一点，我们就把蚝石摆到金门了。”
    他又指着靠近海边的一块洼地说：“那儿是我们民兵练习打靶的地方。”我一眼望去，地上摆着十多架机关枪，机枪后面爬着一组组的民兵，聚精会神地在轮流练习瞄准。他兴奋地说：“我们的民兵不仅是这里的生产队，也是战斗队。他们日夜放哨、生产、练兵。前几天跟炮兵学打炮，都从一炮手学到五炮手了”。正如这里民歌所描写的一样：“民兵英勇全武装，筑成铜壁和铁墙，一旦祖国吹起号，冲上前线把国保”。
    何厝村的民兵队伍中，有不少是青年妇女，女民兵中有著名的十姐妹。她们是十家的姑娘，在支援前线打击敌人的斗争中，有着同一的意志和行动，在同一个支前斗争的岗位上，结成了姐妹。十姐妹中大姐二十三岁，小妹只有十五岁。她们每人都有一支枪，跟男人一样背枪放哨，每天还争先恐后的都到解放军阵地上去收衣服，帮助战士们缝洗，两个多月中，她们已为战士缝洗了三千多件衣服。提起这十位姑娘，战士们就像夸赞自己的亲姐妹那样又热情又亲切。
    这个村子上，还有著名的“小八路”。他们都是何厝小学的少先队员，可是他们又是部队的“小后勤兵”。他们帮助成年人修公路，擦炮弹，送开水，成为解放军叔叔的好帮手。我们走近学校，便看到学校的砖墙被弹片打的坑坑凹凹，山墙上的石灰都打掉了。老师就在这屋里给他们上课。孩子们都很安静很认真地爬在桌上作练习。下课后，便向我们扑来，清脆而又亲热的喊着：“你好，你好！”何大年要我们到他家里去坐，何佳汝也要我们到她家去看看，郭胜源还要下海边去抓几个大螃蟹来招待我们哩。
    何厝村上还有说不完写不完的英雄故事，这里记下的，只不过是大海中的一滴。但从这一滴中，我们不也能感到英雄的人民的脉膊么？
