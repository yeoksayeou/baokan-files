    Thoroughly Smashing "Authority" and "Hierarchy"
    —A Record of the Comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the Department of Neurology at Peking Union Medical College Hospital
    Guo Shaojun, Xiong Shiqi
    Since the beginning of October, the Department of Neurology at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, after eliminating the hierarchical system dominated by bourgeois legal rights ideology, establishing the Party's absolute leadership over professional technology, and implementing the mass line, the principle of "everything for the patient," and the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, has ushered in a comprehensive Great Leap Forward. "Incurable diseases" can now be cured, "certain deaths" are being saved, and the wards, once filled day and night with moans and despair, have been transformed into a cheerful and happy big family.

          Grasping the Key to the Leap Forward
    Since the rectification campaign and the technical revolution, the Party's leadership has been strengthened in the Department of Neurology, as in other units, superstitions have begun to be eliminated, and over thirty innovations have been completed. After implementing 24-hour outpatient services in June, the number of outpatients has increased more than fourfold compared to the past, and the number of hospital beds has increased from twenty-eight to forty-six. At this time, the onlookers in the department clamored that they had already "leaped too far." The hospital Party committee proposed, "Continue the leap forward, fight hard for a month, and offer a gift to National Day." As the days passed quickly, the leap forward targets were not smoothly achieved, and some people had not even started on the innovation projects they were responsible for.
    What was holding back everyone's leap forward? The Party organization carefully examined and analyzed the eleven targets and the situation in the department. It turned out that these eleven innovations were not closely linked to the key national tasks. Most of the topics were proposed based on the interests of experts and were contracted by experts, still not breaking free from the expert line and old traditions. The masses had not been fully mobilized, and the Party's leadership over professional technology had not been effectively established. Peking Union Medical College Hospital originally had a tradition of numerous levels and strict hierarchy. The words of senior physicians were "golden words," and the higher the position and rank of the physician, the further they were from the reality of the patients. Once they were promoted to lecturer or professor, they were mostly aloof, burying themselves in "profound theories" and personal interests. Physicians who had just graduated from school could only deal with patients all day long and had no right to interfere with research work. Sometimes, when senior physicians came to make rounds, they often tried to apply foreign literature to the actual situation of patients and replaced scientific arguments with subjective conclusions.
    Because experts and professors were keen on personal interests and personal fame, and the superstitions of the masses were not completely eliminated, it was impossible to clearly propose an attack on the two major diseases of the nervous system (neurasthenia and cerebrovascular diseases) in the eleven leap forward targets, because these diseases were, in the eyes of experts and professors, a thankless task that could not quickly produce papers that brought both fame and fortune. In the past, patients with these diseases were often treated with a perfunctory attitude or simply turned away. Once, a young physician "violated regulations" by admitting a critically ill cerebrovascular patient to the ward and was rebuked by a professor as "courting death." What experts and professors were obsessed with were rare and strange diseases, cases that were only occasionally encountered once every few years or even decades, which became treasures in the hands of experts and professors. Two professors almost fought over a rare medical record material. In this situation, their leap forward targets could not possibly serve the urgent needs of the broad masses of people, and the leap forward could not possibly be a vigorous mass movement.

    Smash Bourgeois Medical Authority
    Establish Proletarian Health Ambition
    After the Party put forward the resounding slogans of "Smash bourgeois medical authority, establish proletarian health ambition" and "Smash bourgeois legal rights ideology, establish socialist rules and regulations," the comrades in the Department of Neurology quickly understood what were the main obstacles currently standing in the way of their continued Great Leap Forward.
    One evening in late September, the Party organization convened a department-wide meeting, which was a meeting of fierce debate and a meeting of great destruction and great construction. Based on this meeting, the Department of Neurology immediately began a rapid transformation in the following aspects.
    From the beginning of October, senior physicians were sent down to outpatient clinics and wards to specifically undertake outpatient and medical work, and research work was carried out based on facing reality and serving patients. The boundaries between levels were eliminated, and everyone learned to be versatile, uniting superiors and subordinates. In order to promote traditional Chinese medicine, everyone learned acupuncture and plum-blossom needle therapy after ten days of hard work, and began the study of "Introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine" in a planned way. Nurses began to undertake some of the routine treatment work of physicians, such as injections, blood transfusions, infusions, and punctures, so that physicians could better concentrate their efforts on treatment. Physicians also actively took advantage of every opportunity to help with nursing work. Whenever it was mealtime, not only nurses but also physicians fed patients. In this way, superiors and subordinates and medical staff were united into one family, and work efficiency and medical quality were significantly improved. Some chaotic phenomena in past work were quickly overcome, and the same personnel completed one to several times more work than in the past.
    Implement technical democracy. Within the entire department, with the Party organization as the core, and with the participation of young people and veteran experts who were both politically and technically good and had a certain organizational ability, a core group was formed to be responsible for the leadership of the department's medical and research work. Diseases that were previously unpopular but that the broad masses of people suffered from and could not be cured became the common target of attack for the entire department. The ward began to admit a large number of patients with cerebrovascular diseases, and the first batch of one hundred neurasthenia patients were concentrated in the outpatient clinic. Various effective integrated Chinese and Western medicine therapies were used to begin a planned treatment. Everyone learned to apply the principle of "dialectical treatment" in traditional Chinese medicine theory in practical work, dividing patients into different types according to different symptoms and adopting different treatment methods, changing the unrealistic method of treating all cases of neurasthenia in the same way in the past. In just half a month, more than half of them began to improve. In the event of critically ill and difficult patients, the Party organization immediately organized a rescue team including relevant medical staff, and everyone jointly discussed the treatment plan, giving full play to collective wisdom. Now it is no longer the experts who have the final say, and young people can constantly put forward many new therapies and constructive opinions in collective discussions. In the treatment work, they do not neglect to absorb the opinions of experts, but some experts, due to long-term detachment from reality, often appear helpless in the face of new things today, or provide some outdated old methods from foreign literature many years ago. Once, when rescuing a patient with cerebral hemorrhage, in the discussion, a professor proposed to draw 400 CC of blood. At that time, the patient was undergoing artificial hibernation and had myocardial ischemia. Obviously, this method was wrong, and everyone disagreed with taking this method. A professor used to use the saying "old ginger is spicier" to reprimand young people, but now this sentence can no longer be heard.
    Large-scale collaboration replaces working alone. In the struggle against major diseases, everyone quickly discovered that the strength of one person or one department was small, and the idea and method of large-scale collaboration became everyone's common requirement. In addition to the collaboration between superiors and subordinates and between medical staff within the department, it is also necessary for all relevant departments in the hospital to collaborate together. In the recent rescue of severe cerebral hemorrhage and several other critically ill patients, physicians from traditional Chinese medicine, internal medicine, surgery, and anesthesia all joined the battle at their active request. In the treatment of neurasthenia patients, it is necessary to humbly accept the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine when using various traditional Chinese medicine therapies, and it is also necessary to coordinate with relevant departments when conducting social investigations of etiology.

    Miracles Appear　Patients Praise
    After great destruction and great construction, a department-wide Great Leap Forward was launched, and great results were achieved in less than a month. In addition to daily outpatient and medical work, they successively rushed to rescue more than a dozen critically ill patients, some of whom were previously considered certain deaths, but were also rescued in the face of collective strength. Miracles of the "Qiu Cai Kang" type continued to appear. A worker comrade poisoned by carbon monoxide had fallen into a serious coma, complicated by pneumonia, the corneal and pupillary reflexes were about to disappear, and the limbs were paralyzed. If this had happened in the past, it would have been considered a certain death. This time, when he was admitted to the hospital, some people lacked confidence in organizing the rescue, but the Party organization immediately organized a rescue team including relevant physicians. After four days and nights of continuous hard work, and after the comprehensive application of various Chinese and Western medicine therapies, the worker comrade was finally brought back from danger and completely regained consciousness. Another patient with severe cerebral hemorrhage, who was also considered a "terminal illness" in the past, and who some experts and professors would not have allowed to be admitted to the hospital at all, was now resurrected under the collective rescue efforts.
    In the past, outpatient patients had many opinions about the medical staff in the Department of Neurology and often wrote letters to express criticism and dissatisfaction, but now the letters received by the Department of Neurology every day are mostly praising their work. The Beijing Glass Factory stated in a letter that because a worker comrade who was severely poisoned by carbon monoxide was revived under everyone's rescue efforts, it greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers in the factory, and they must better complete their production tasks. In the past, in the hospital wards, the crying of patients in the Department of Neurology was the most severe, but now it is not only no longer heard, but many patients have become singers and poets. A patient with lower limb muscle atrophy (for which there is currently no specific medicine) wrote a poem on his sickbed, praising the ward born in this great era:

    She is like a close-knit big family,
    She is like a classroom for diligent work and study,
    She is like a venue for discussing major domestic and foreign affairs,
    She is like a camp ready to set off after rest.
    Here,
    The sound of laughter drives away moans and pain,
    Collective strength and strong will overcome despair and sorrow,
    Today, they are recuperating here from nervous system diseases,
    Tomorrow, they will embark on the journey and rush to various battlefields.

    Currently, the various departments of Peking Union Medical College Hospital have launched a mass friendship competition movement of "learning from the Department of Neurology and catching up with the Department of Neurology." The remaining bourgeois traditional forces in the entire Peking Union Medical College Hospital will also be completely swept away soon. The comrades in the Department of Neurology are also determined to take advantage of the victory and advance on the existing basis to make greater contributions to the motherland's medical and health undertakings.

    大破“权威”和“等级制”
    ——记协和医院脑系科的全面大跃进
    郭少军　熊世琦
    从10月初以来，北京协和医院脑系科在破除了资产阶级法权思想支配下的等级制度以后，确立了党对业务技术的绝对领导，贯彻了群众路线、一切从病人出发和中西医结合的方针，从而出现了一个全面大跃进的局面。“不治之症”能治了，“必死”的病人救活了，过去日夜充满着呻吟和失望的病房，变成了欢畅快乐的大家庭。
          抓住跃进关键
    整风和技术革命以来，脑系科和其他单位一样，党的领导加强了，迷信开始破除，完成了三十多项革新。6月份实行二十四小时门诊后，门诊人数比过去增加四倍以上，病房床位由二十八张增至四十六张。这时科里观潮派叫嚷着已经“跃过了火”。院党委提出
  “继续跃进，苦战一个月，向国庆献礼”。日子一天天飞快的逝去，跃进指标并没有顺利实现，有些人对自己负责的革新项目甚至还根本没有着手去搞。
    是什么东西绊住了大家跃进的脚步呢？党组织仔细检查分析了十一项指标和科里的情况。原来这十一项革新并没有紧密结合国家重点任务，大多数题目还是根据专家兴趣提出，由专家挂名包办，仍然没有摆脱专家路线和旧传统的束缚，群众还没有完全发动起来，党对业务技术的领导还没能有效地确立。协和原来有这样一种传统：层次繁多，等级严明，上级医师的话是“金口玉言”，医师的职位级别越高，脱离病人实际越远，一升到讲师、教授，便多是高高在上，埋头于“高深理论”和个人兴趣，刚出校门的医师只有终日和病人打交道，对研究工作无权过问，有时高级医师下来查房，也往往是以外国文献套病人实际，以主观结论代替科学论断。
    由于专家教授热中个人兴趣和个人名利，群众的迷信未彻底清除，十一项跃进指标就不可能明确提出对神经系统两大疾病（神经衰弱和脑血管疾病）展开攻击，因为这些病在专家教授们的眼睛里是费力不讨好，不能很快搞出名利双收的论文。过去对这些疾病患者，多是采取应付态度，或干脆拒之于门外，一次，青年医师“违章”把危重脑血管病人收入病房，竟被一位教授斥之为“自杀之道”。专家教授所迷恋的却是罕见的怪症，几年甚至几十年才偶尔碰到的病例，到了专家教授手里就成了宝贝。有两位教授，一次为着争夺一份罕见病历材料，几乎闹的要打起架来。在这种情况下，其跃进指标当然不可能是为广大人民的迫切需要服务，跃进也不可能是轰轰烈烈的群众运动。
    破资产阶级医药权威
    立无产阶级卫生志气
    党提出“破资产阶级医药权威，立无产阶级卫生志气”，“破资产阶级法权思想，立社会主义规章制度”的响亮口号后，脑系科的同志们很快明白了：什么是目前摆在他们继续大跃进道路上的主要障碍。
    9月下旬的一个晚上，党组织召开了一个全科大会，这是一个激烈论战的大会，又是一个大破大立的大会。在这次会议的基础上，脑系科从以下几个方面马上开始了急剧的变化。
    高级医师从10月初起下放到门诊和病房具体担任门诊和医疗工作，在面向实际和为病人服务的基础上开展研究工作。等级之间的界限打消了，人人学作多面手，上下一致；为发扬祖国医学，苦战十天，每个人都学会了针灸和梅花针疗法，并有步骤地开始了“中医学概论”的学习。护士们开始担负起医师们的部分常规治疗工作，如打针、输血、输液、穿刺等，使医师们更好集中力量于治疗，医师们也主动利用一切机会帮助作护理工作，每遇开饭时间，给病人喂饭的不仅有护士，也有医师。这样一来，上下级医师之间和医护之间由分家合成了一家，工作效率和医疗质量显著提高，过去工作中的一些忙乱现象很快被克服，同样的人员完成了比过去多一倍以至数倍的工作量。
    实行技术民主。在全科范围内以党组织为核心，并由政治和技术条件都好而又有一定组织能力的青年和老专家共同参加，组成核心组，负责全科医疗和研究工作的领导。过去不受欢迎却为广大人民苦于不治的疾病，成了全科一致攻击的目标，病房里开始收容大量脑血管疾病患者，在门诊集中了第一批一百名神经衰弱患者，采用各种有效的中西医综合疗法，开始了有步骤的治疗。大家在实际工作中学习运用祖国医学理论中“辩证论治”的原则，根据不同症状把患者分为不同类型，采取不同的治疗方法，改变了过去只要是神经衰弱就千篇一律对待的那种脱离实际的方法。在短短半个月时间内，有半数以上开始有了好转。遇有危重和疑难病人，立即以党组织为核心组织包括有关医护人员参加的抢救小组，大家共同讨论治疗方案，充分发挥集体智慧。现在再不是专家说了算，青年们在集体讨论中能不断提出许多新的疗法和建设性的意见。在治疗工作中，他们并不忽视吸收专家的意见，但是，有些专家由于长期脱离实际，今天在新事物面前，往往表现束手无策，或提供一些多年前外国文献上过时的老办法。有一次抢救一位脑出血病人，在讨论中，一位教授提出要放血四百CC，当时病人正作人工冬眠，又有心肌供血不足现象，显然这个办法不对，大家不同意采取此种办法。一位教授过去惯于用“姜是老的辣”这句话去训斥青年，现在再也听不到这句话了。
    大协作代单干。大家在和主要疾病作斗争中，很快就发现一个人或一个部门的力量是微小的，大协作的思想和方法成了大家的共同要求。协作的范围除了本科上下之间和医护之间的协作外，还必须全院有关各科之间共同协作起来。在近来抢救严重脑血管出血及其他数个危重病人中，中医、内、外、麻醉各科的医师们都在他们积极要求下，一齐投入了战斗。在治疗神经衰弱病人当中，采用各种中医疗法时，必需虚心接受中医指导，在进行病因社会调查时还需与有关各科步调一致。
    奇迹出现　病人歌颂
    经过大破大立，掀起了全科大跃进，在不到一个月的时间内取得很大成效。除日常门诊和医疗工作外，他们连续突击抢救了十多个危重病人，其中有的在过去被认为是必死的病人，也在集体力量面前被救活了，“丘财康”式的奇迹不断出现。一位一氧化碳中毒的工人同志已陷入严重昏迷，合并肺炎，角膜与瞳孔反射即将消失，四肢麻痹，如在过去将被认为必死无疑，这次入院，也有人对组织抢救信心不足，但是党组织立即组织了包括有关医师参加的抢救小组，在四个昼夜的连续苦战中，经过各种中西医疗法的综合运用，终于使这位工人同志转危为安，完全清醒过来。另一位严重脑出血患者，过去也被认为是“绝症”，如在过去，某些专家教授根本就不可能让其入院，现在也在集体力量的抢救下，使这位患者死而复生了。
    过去门诊病人对脑系科医护人员的意见较多，经常来信提出批评和不满，而现在脑系科每天收到的来信中却多是对他们的工作提出赞扬。北京市玻璃厂在来信中表示，由于一严重一氧化碳中毒的工人同志，在大家抢救下复活了，大大鼓舞了全厂工人的干劲，他们一定要更好完成生产任务。过去在医院病房中，脑系科病人的哭闹声最厉害，现在不仅听不到了，而且有很多病人都成了歌手和诗人。一位下肢肌肉萎缩患者（目前尚无特效药治疗），在病榻上挥笔写诗一首，歌颂这个伟大时代里诞生的病房：
    她像是一个亲密团结的大家庭，
    她像是一个勤工俭学的课堂，
    她像是一个讨论国内外大事的会场，
    她像是一个休整中待命出发的营帐。
    在这里，
    欢笑的声浪驱走了呻吟和痛苦，
    集体的力量和坚强意志战胜了绝望和悲伤，
    今天作为神经系统疾病在此休养，
    明天他们将跨上征途奔赴各个战场。
    目前，协和医院各科已经掀起了一个“学脑系科赶脑系科”的群众性友谊竞赛运动，整个协和医院所残留的资产阶级传统势力也将很快被彻底扫清，脑系科的同志也决心在现有基础上乘胜前进，为祖国医学卫生事业做出更大贡献。
