Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 15th - The iron and steel front in Hubei Province has adopted the method of "intensive cultivation and meticulous work," rapidly breaking through the quality barrier of native iron, resulting in iron of good quality. According to the analysis of eleven samples of native iron produced in Xishui and Luotian counties by the Daye Steel Plant, the iron content is all above 94.96%; the carbon element, which is beneficial to increasing the strength of pig iron, has a content of 2% - 4%; the proportion of harmful impurities in pig iron is very small, the phosphorus content is below 0.7%, of which nine samples are below 0.4%, the sulfur content is mostly between 0.02% and 0.09%, and it contains a certain proportion of silicon and manganese. Such pig iron is a good raw material for alkaline open-hearth steelmaking widely used in our country. According to the analysis of native iron produced in Yichang, Huangmei, Wufeng and other counties, the iron content has also reached 92% - 96%.
	Hubei Province's ability to produce high-quality pig iron is a victory for the broad masses who have worked hard to study and overcome technical barriers. For example, the steel workers in some communes in Macheng, Yingshan and other counties, although they were farmers who knew nothing about ironmaking two or three months ago, they used the method of "intensive cultivation and meticulous work" in agriculture to make iron with amazing perseverance and hard work. The iron sand they brought from the river was carefully selected again and again, and they had to wash it four or five times to remove the miscellaneous sand, so that the purity reached more than 90%, and then put it in a pot to heat it before refining it. The workers of the "Huang Jiguang Furnace" in the Dongfeng People's Commune of Macheng also used magnets to test the iron content, and if the purity was not enough, they rewashed it. Increasing the air force to increase the furnace temperature is the key to ensuring the quality of pig iron. In this regard, the masses have also created a lot of experience, such as changing single bellows to double bellows, changing cold air to hot air, and changing square bellows to round bellows. Chaomei People's Commune in Baokang County has already used more than 40 water-powered blowers. The use of this blower can make the furnace temperature reach 1,300 to 1,500 degrees Celsius, which is more than 200 degrees Celsius higher than the furnace temperature of manual bellows. In addition, the workers continue to improve furnace construction technology and furnace front operation technology, so that the iron tapping of the furnace gradually becomes normal, not only producing more iron but also producing good iron. A small blast furnace of eight cubic meters in the Yuhua Yarn Factory in Wuhan City produced more than 500 tons of pig iron from September 7 to November 7, all of which were gray iron.
	The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has always put guaranteeing the quality of pig iron in the first place, and has repeatedly emphasized it in various instructions, telephone conferences and other occasions. The Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, headed by Zhao Xiu, the first secretary, organized five inspection teams to help various counties identify the quality of pig iron, conduct inventory and ranking, and decided to report the unqualified sintered iron after it was refined into steel. As for ferrous oxide, it will be prepared for remelting as ore. The Suixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China has also formed an inspection team to inspect the quality of pig iron in various communes, and has dealt with unqualified sintered iron or iron slag mixtures separately. The county party committee also plans to build more native blast furnaces of more than 0.5 cubic meters to gradually replace the current 3,000 small native furnaces in order to ensure the quality of pig iron.

    产量高还要质量好有好铁就能炼好钢
    新华社武汉15日电　湖北省钢铁战线上采用“精耕细作”的方法，迅速突破土铁质量关，所产生铁质量良好。据大冶钢厂对浠水、罗田两县所产土铁的十一个样品的化验分析，含铁量都在94.96％；有利于增加生铁强度的炭元素，含量在2％——4％；生铁中有害杂质的比重很小，磷的含量在0.7％以下，其中九个样品在0.4％以下，硫的含量大部分在0.02％到0.09％，并且含有一定比重的矽和锰。这样的生铁，是我国广泛采用的碱性平炉炼钢用的好原料。另据对宜昌、黄梅、五峰等县所产土铁的化验分析，含铁量也都达到92％——96％。
    湖北省能够生产出质地优良的生铁，是广大群众刻苦钻研、猛攻技术关的胜利。像麻城、应山等县一些公社的钢铁工人，虽然在两三个月以前还是对炼铁一窍不通的庄稼汉，可是他们以惊人的毅力和刻苦精神，把农业上“精耕细作”的方法运用来炼铁，把河里淘上来的铁砂一次又一次地精选，总得淘上四、五遍去掉杂砂，使纯度达到90％以上，再放到锅里炒热，然后再炼。麻城东风人民公社“黄继光炉”的工人，还用吸铁石来测验铁的含量，纯度不够就重新淘过。加大风力提高炉温，是保证生铁质量的关键。在这方面，群众也创造了不少经验，如改单风箱为双风箱，改冷风为热风，改方风箱为圆风箱等等。保康县超美人民公社已经改用四十多部水打鼓风机，使用这种鼓风机可以使炉温达到一千三百度到一千五百度，比人力拉风箱的炉温高二百多度。除此以外，工人们还不断改进建炉技术、炉前操作技术，使炉子出铁逐渐正常，不仅多出铁而且出好铁。武汉市裕华纱厂一座八立方公尺的小高炉，从9月7日投入生产到11月7日，共出了五百多吨生铁，全部都是灰口铁。
    中共湖北省委一直把保证生铁质量放在首要地位，在历次指示、电话会议以及其他各种场合都一再加以强调。中共襄阳地委以第一书记赵修为首组织了五个检查团，帮助各县鉴别生铁质量，进行清仓排队，对于不合规格的烧结铁，决定在炼成钢以后再上报，至于一氧化铁就准备作为矿石重新冶炼。中共随县县委也已组成检查组到各公社检查生铁质量，对不合规格的烧结铁或铁渣混合物分别作了处理。县委还准备增建零点五立方公尺以上的土高炉，来逐步代替目前的三千多个小小土炉，以保证生铁质量。
