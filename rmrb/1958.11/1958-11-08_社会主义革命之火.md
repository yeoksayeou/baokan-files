The following is the translation:

Karl Marx drew a clear line of demarcation between bourgeois and proletarian revolutions. He said that although bourgeois revolutions come on swiftly, they are fleeting things. They are full of dramatic effects but lack profound content. In contrast, proletarian revolutions develop slowly but are profound. They engage in self-criticism, sometimes retreating, but then moving forward again, paving the way to the ultimate goal of communism.

Historical facts confirm this theoretical generalization made by Marx. The French Revolution of the late eighteenth century is known as the classic bourgeois revolution. It was full of dramatic effects. The revolutionary flames it unleashed were rapid and bright, but soon died out. In the brief period of less than ten years, the Revolution of 1789 traced a path from the overthrow of the monarchy to military dictatorship and the restoration of the old order. Its flames were extinguished.

However, the eternally burning flame of the Great October Socialist Revolution, which has illuminated the globe, has been burning for forty-one years. During these years, all the reactionary forces of the old world have attempted to extinguish the flames of socialism. They have failed. World wars have not helped the enemies of socialism to do this. In the world war, German fascism was the tool of international imperialism against the first socialist country.

Forty-one years! However, in the Soviet state, the flames of socialism have not only not diminished but have become increasingly fervent. Our country, the cradle of socialism, has entered the 1950s. In the past forty-one years, in bourgeois countries, countless governments have risen and fallen, countless political parties have disappeared in a flash, countless social and political systems have been replaced, and Western Europe and its military blocs have appeared so weak, desperate, and senile... However, in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party, the inspirer and organizer of the victory of socialism, has been at the helm for forty-one years as if it were one day. For forty-one years, the Soviet government has been leading its people continuously towards the brilliant peak of higher communism. Words such as "aging" and "senility" are not applicable to socialist nations. In a few years and decades, socialist nations do not age but become younger. This is true of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and of all the people's democracies.

The Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp are becoming younger, growing, and becoming stronger. We have seen the same phenomenon in the great People's China as has occurred in the Soviet Union. Life is seething. People are full of inexhaustible energy. Their hands are engaged in creative labor. Their minds are full of broad ideas and grand plans.

We are not preparing to comment on the revolutionary events of the past year. We only want to talk briefly about a few facts filled with amazing miracles and advancing world history.

While celebrating the forty-first anniversary of the October Revolution, the entire Soviet Union is seriously preparing for the 21st Congress of the CPSU and welcoming the new Seven-Year Plan. The whole country is preparing to make a vigorous leap forward on the road to communism. The world has long seen the tremendous achievements in economy and culture in the Soviet regime's various Five-Year Plans. Those days are long gone when bourgeois thinkers, upon seeing the indicators of the Soviet Union's growth rate, did not believe their own eyes and repeatedly said: This is fundamentally impossible. Now they believe it, they know it can be done, and so they are plotting to use forceful means to block this shocking continuous growth. This is wishful thinking! The Seven-Year Plan for 1959-1965 surprises even those who have long ceased to be surprised.

The issue is not just the huge numbers but the new quality. The new surge in Soviet production marks the development of new relations, new life, and new people. If the Soviet Union has completely eliminated poverty in the past stages of socialism, then now it is a further substantial increase in the material well-being of all working people, their entire personal interests are guaranteed, and their living standards reach heights unattainable under the capitalist system. Socialism shows its superiority over capitalism more vividly, not only in labor productivity but also in guaranteeing the welfare of all working people and the unprecedented development of material and spiritual culture. This inspires the Soviet people, both old and young, to make new achievements in struggle and labor. The flame of creation illuminates our hearts and minds. This flame tempers iron into steel and tempers people's souls into the heroism of selfless labor for the construction of a new communist society.

The task put forward by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass advanced capitalist countries in terms of per capita product production in the shortest possible time is nearing resolution. Now, the Soviet Union is the most powerful country. In the future, it will be even more powerful. It looks with calm and contempt at the enemies of the Soviet Union who are trying to provoke an atomic war. Those who try to provoke an atomic war are doomed. No matter how much suffering this war inflicts on the people of all countries, it will lead to the death of capitalism and the victory of communism. The Soviet people do not need war and do not want to start a war. The Soviet people, like all peace-loving countries that have been or are being liberated from imperialist oppression, need peace.

Imperialism is running around and scurrying everywhere. It is afraid of the great tide of anger of the people of all countries. It does not believe in its own strength, but it is still carrying out military provocations all over the world. It attacked Egypt and suffered a shameful defeat. It infiltrated Syria but was also rebuffed here. This year, American imperialism, in collusion with British imperialism, attacked Lebanon and Jordan. The people of all countries drove it out of these places. When it fled, it wanted people to believe that it left on its own accord. The birth of the United Arab Republic, the unity of the Arab countries, and the liberation of Iraq from colonial oppression - these are all evidence of the failure of imperialism. The reason why the people of the Arab countries have been able to triumph is because the socialist and democratic world, led by the Soviet Union, stands on their side. "No imperialist intervention in the East!" The socialist and democratic world said solemnly and calmly. So the imperialist dogs tucked their tails and slipped away.

However, imperialism has not learned a lesson from recent events. Now it is plotting new adventures in the Far East. But, standing before it and Chiang Kai-shek's scum is the Great People's China, a wall of bronze and iron. America also sees the Soviet Union, the fraternal brother of the Chinese people, standing shoulder to shoulder with People's China.

The provocations of American imperialism continue. However, on the occasion of the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Revolution, we can point out the following significant phenomena. The socialist and democratic world is resolutely united in resisting any act of aggression. Fraternal friendship has forged an unbreakable alliance of mutual assistance among the socialist nations. The governments of all socialist countries have a consistent foreign policy - a policy of peace and the struggle for the independence of all nations.

But, what has imperialism's provocation revealed? In the attack on Egypt, Britain, France, and Israel participated. The United States across the ocean secretly supported them. Other capitalist countries also helped them.

In the attack on Lebanon and Jordan, only the United States and Britain participated. Other capitalist countries took a bystander attitude.

The United States has neither allies nor partners in the Taiwan Strait. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact are all paralyzed.

The socialist world is thriving, and the capitalist world is at the end of its rope.

Now something has happened that bourgeois thinkers did not expect and thought was impossible.

American imperialism trumpets to the whole world that they will give economic assistance to all countries that need it. The American president cherishes this aid plan like a chicken feather as an arrow. But, in reality, American imperialists have not given any real assistance to anyone because in their view, economic assistance is to supply American weapons in preparation for wars against the Soviet Union, People's China, and the entire socialist camp. The people of almost all countries reject this kind of assistance.

The Soviet Union silently, without fanfare, and without boasting, gives genuine assistance to underdeveloped countries, providing them with material resources, goods, and sending technical advisors, without attaching any enslaving or military conditions. This assistance truly comes from friendship and is selfless.

The Egyptian people have long requested the capitalist world to help them build a dam on the Nile River to protect the vital interests of the country. The American imperialists agreed to provide this assistance on the condition that Egypt return to the era of the Pharaohs and that Egyptian farmers become slaves to American Pharaoh capital. However, the proud Egyptian people refused this condition of kneeling before the American Pharaohs of the twentieth century. The New York Stock Exchange refused to give the Egyptian people the necessary credit to build the Aswan High Dam. The imperialists gloated and stood by, thinking that if they did not pay, then no one would give the Egyptians money. They were dead wrong. There is already a force in the world that can help small and weak nations. This is the power of socialism. On the eve of the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Revolution, the Soviet people generously and selflessly provided materials and technology to assist in the construction of the Aswan Dam on the Nile River. Although the Soviet Union's own grand construction requires a lot of funds, this does not prevent the Soviet people from helping their friends. This makes all the Soviet people feel their own strength. This also shows the superiority of socialism over capitalism. We are proud that in one of the largest projects of our time, there is a share of our labor and our culture.

The flames of the capitalist West are about to be extinguished. The cold rain and bitter wind of the economic crisis have extinguished the steelmaking furnaces and iron smelting furnaces in the United States. Large tracts of land in the western United States are barren, overgrown with weeds, covered with gravel, and hundreds of thousands and millions of unemployed people are wandering around, desperately looking for work and bread. The flames in the schools are about to be extinguished, and people are becoming savage in racial hatred. The civilization of the bourgeoisie is at the end of its rope.

But in socialist countries, the revolutionary flame of creation is becoming more and more radiant. On the ruins of the cursed past, batches of new and brilliant buildings are rising. The number of primary and secondary schools and universities is constantly increasing. Free science is creating miracles in laboratories. Humanity, armed with scientific knowledge, is moving beyond the Earth's atmosphere into the vast expanse of outer space. Soviet artificial satellites are natural communist satellites. These satellites revolving around the Earth herald the arrival of a new, bright, and joyful era for all (an era of happiness for the entire Earth).
