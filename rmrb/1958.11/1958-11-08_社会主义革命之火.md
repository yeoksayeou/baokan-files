The following is the translation:

Karl Marx drew a clear line of demarcation between bourgeois and proletarian revolutions. He said that although bourgeois revolutions come on swiftly, they are fleeting things. They are full of dramatic effects but lack profound content. In contrast, proletarian revolutions develop slowly but are profound. They engage in self-criticism, sometimes retreating, but then moving forward again, paving the way to the ultimate goal of communism.

Historical facts confirm this theoretical generalization made by Marx. The French Revolution of the late eighteenth century is known as the classic bourgeois revolution. It was full of dramatic effects. The revolutionary flames it unleashed were rapid and bright, but soon died out. In the brief period of less than ten years, the Revolution of 1789 traced a path from the overthrow of the monarchy to military dictatorship and the restoration of the old order. Its flames were extinguished.

However, the eternally burning flame of the Great October Socialist Revolution, which has illuminated the globe, has been burning for forty-one years. During these years, all the reactionary forces of the old world have attempted to extinguish the flames of socialism. They have failed. World wars have not helped the enemies of socialism to do this. In the world war, German fascism was the tool of international imperialism against the first socialist country.

Forty-one years! However, in the Soviet state, the flames of socialism have not only not diminished but have become increasingly fervent. Our country, the cradle of socialism, has entered the 1950s. In the past forty-one years, in bourgeois countries, countless governments have risen and fallen, countless political parties have disappeared in a flash, countless social and political systems have been replaced, and Western Europe and its military blocs have appeared so weak, desperate, and senile... However, in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party, the inspirer and organizer of the victory of socialism, has been at the helm for forty-one years as if it were one day. For forty-one years, the Soviet government has been leading its people continuously towards the brilliant peak of higher communism. Words such as "aging" and "senility" are not applicable to socialist nations. In a few years and decades, socialist nations do not age but become younger. This is true of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and of all the people's democracies.

The Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp are becoming younger, growing, and becoming stronger. We have seen the same phenomenon in the great People's China as has occurred in the Soviet Union. Life is seething. People are full of inexhaustible energy. Their hands are engaged in creative labor. Their minds are full of broad ideas and grand plans.

We are not preparing to comment on the revolutionary events of the past year. We only want to talk briefly about a few facts filled with amazing miracles and advancing world history.

While celebrating the forty-first anniversary of the October Revolution, the entire Soviet Union is seriously preparing for the 21st Congress of the CPSU and welcoming the new Seven-Year Plan. The whole country is preparing to make a vigorous leap forward on the road to communism. The world has long seen the tremendous achievements in economy and culture in the Soviet regime's various Five-Year Plans. Those days are long gone when bourgeois thinkers, upon seeing the indicators of the Soviet Union's growth rate, did not believe their own eyes and repeatedly said: This is fundamentally impossible. Now they believe it, they know it can be done, and so they are plotting to use forceful means to block this shocking continuous growth. This is wishful thinking! The Seven-Year Plan for 1959-1965 surprises even those who have long ceased to be surprised.

The issue is not just the huge numbers but the new quality. The new surge in Soviet production marks the development of new relations, new life, and new people. If the Soviet Union has completely eliminated poverty in the past stages of socialism, then now it is a further substantial increase in the material well-being of all working people, their entire personal interests are guaranteed, and their living standards reach heights unattainable under the capitalist system. Socialism shows its superiority over capitalism more vividly, not only in labor productivity but also in guaranteeing the welfare of all working people and the unprecedented development of material and spiritual culture. This inspires the Soviet people, both old and young, to make new achievements in struggle and labor. The flame of creation illuminates our hearts and minds. This flame tempers iron into steel and tempers people's souls into the heroism of selfless labor for the construction of a new communist society.

The task put forward by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass advanced capitalist countries in terms of per capita product production in the shortest possible time is nearing resolution. Now, the Soviet Union is the most powerful country. In the future, it will be even more powerful. It looks with calm and contempt at the enemies of the Soviet Union who are trying to provoke an atomic war. Those who try to provoke an atomic war are doomed. No matter how much suffering this war inflicts on the people of all countries, it will lead to the death of capitalism and the victory of communism. The Soviet people do not need war and do not want to start a war. The Soviet people, like all peace-loving countries that have been or are being liberated from imperialist oppression, need peace.

Imperialism is running around and scurrying everywhere. It is afraid of the great tide of anger of the people of all countries. It does not believe in its own strength, but it is still carrying out military provocations all over the world. It attacked Egypt and suffered a shameful defeat. It infiltrated Syria but was also rebuffed here. This year, American imperialism, in collusion with British imperialism, attacked Lebanon and Jordan. The people of all countries drove it out of these places. When it fled, it wanted people to believe that it left on its own accord. The birth of the United Arab Republic, the unity of the Arab countries, and the liberation of Iraq from colonial oppression - these are all evidence of the failure of imperialism. The reason why the people of the Arab countries have been able to triumph is because the socialist and democratic world, led by the Soviet Union, stands on their side. "No imperialist intervention in the East!" The socialist and democratic world said solemnly and calmly. So the imperialist dogs tucked their tails and slipped away.

However, imperialism has not learned a lesson from recent events. Now it is plotting new adventures in the Far East. But, standing before it and Chiang Kai-shek's scum is the Great People's China, a wall of bronze and iron. America also sees the Soviet Union, the fraternal brother of the Chinese people, standing shoulder to shoulder with People's China.

The provocations of American imperialism continue. However, on the occasion of the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Revolution, we can point out the following significant phenomena. The socialist and democratic world is resolutely united in resisting any act of aggression. Fraternal friendship has forged an unbreakable alliance of mutual assistance among the socialist nations. The governments of all socialist countries have a consistent foreign policy - a policy of peace and the struggle for the independence of all nations.

But, what has imperialism's provocation revealed? In the attack on Egypt, Britain, France, and Israel participated. The United States across the ocean secretly supported them. Other capitalist countries also helped them.

In the attack on Lebanon and Jordan, only the United States and Britain participated. Other capitalist countries took a bystander attitude.

The United States has neither allies nor partners in the Taiwan Strait. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact are all paralyzed.

The socialist world is thriving, and the capitalist world is at the end of its rope.

Now something has happened that bourgeois thinkers did not expect and thought was impossible.

American imperialism trumpets to the whole world that they will give economic assistance to all countries that need it. The American president cherishes this aid plan like a chicken feather as an arrow. But, in reality, American imperialists have not given any real assistance to anyone because in their view, economic assistance is to supply American weapons in preparation for wars against the Soviet Union, People's China, and the entire socialist camp. The people of almost all countries reject this kind of assistance.

The Soviet Union silently, without fanfare, and without boasting, gives genuine assistance to underdeveloped countries, providing them with material resources, goods, and sending technical advisors, without attaching any enslaving or military conditions. This assistance truly comes from friendship and is selfless.

The Egyptian people have long requested the capitalist world to help them build a dam on the Nile River to protect the vital interests of the country. The American imperialists agreed to provide this assistance on the condition that Egypt return to the era of the Pharaohs and that Egyptian farmers become slaves to American Pharaoh capital. However, the proud Egyptian people refused this condition of kneeling before the American Pharaohs of the twentieth century. The New York Stock Exchange refused to give the Egyptian people the necessary credit to build the Aswan High Dam. The imperialists gloated and stood by, thinking that if they did not pay, then no one would give the Egyptians money. They were dead wrong. There is already a force in the world that can help small and weak nations. This is the power of socialism. On the eve of the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Revolution, the Soviet people generously and selflessly provided materials and technology to assist in the construction of the Aswan Dam on the Nile River. Although the Soviet Union's own grand construction requires a lot of funds, this does not prevent the Soviet people from helping their friends. This makes all the Soviet people feel their own strength. This also shows the superiority of socialism over capitalism. We are proud that in one of the largest projects of our time, there is a share of our labor and our culture.

The flames of the capitalist West are about to be extinguished. The cold rain and bitter wind of the economic crisis have extinguished the steelmaking furnaces and iron smelting furnaces in the United States. Large tracts of land in the western United States are barren, overgrown with weeds, covered with gravel, and hundreds of thousands and millions of unemployed people are wandering around, desperately looking for work and bread. The flames in the schools are about to be extinguished, and people are becoming savage in racial hatred. The civilization of the bourgeoisie is at the end of its rope.

But in socialist countries, the revolutionary flame of creation is becoming more and more radiant. On the ruins of the cursed past, batches of new and brilliant buildings are rising. The number of primary and secondary schools and universities is constantly increasing. Free science is creating miracles in laboratories. Humanity, armed with scientific knowledge, is moving beyond the Earth's atmosphere into the vast expanse of outer space. Soviet artificial satellites are natural communist satellites. These satellites revolving around the Earth herald the arrival of a new, bright, and joyful era for all (an era of happiness for the entire Earth).

    社会主义革命之火
    苏联　德·萨斯拉夫斯基
    卡尔·马克思在资产阶级革命和无产阶级革命之间，划了一条截然的界限。他说，资产阶级革命虽然来势迅猛，却是浮光掠影的东西。它充满戏剧性的效果，但缺乏深刻的内容。和这相反，无产阶级革命虽然发展缓慢，然而是深刻的。它进行自我批判，有时向后退，但跟着又重新前进，为达到最终的目标共产主义而开辟道路。
    历史事实证实了马克思所作的这一理论上的概括。十八世纪末的法国革命，被称为古典的资产阶级革命。它充满戏剧性的效果。它爆发出来的革命火焰，迅速而鲜明，但不久就熄灭了。1789年革命在不足十年的暂短时期内，开出了一条从推翻君主制到将军独裁和旧制度复辟的道路。它的火焰熄灭了。
    但是，照亮了全球的、伟大十月社会主义革命永不熄灭的火焰，已经一直燃烧了四十一年。在这些年代里，旧世界的所有反动势力，一直企图扑灭社会主义的火焰。他们失败了。世界大战也没有帮助社会主义的敌人做到这一点。在世界大战中，德国法西斯主义是国际帝国主义反对第一个社会主义国家的工具。
    四十一年了！可是，在苏维埃国家里，社会主义的火焰不仅没有减弱，反而日益炽烈起来。曾经是社会主义摇篮的我国，已经进入了五十年代。在过去的四十一年里，在资产阶级国家里不知有多少个政府兴兴衰衰，不知有多少个政党倏忽泯没，不知更换了多少个社会政治制度，而且西欧及其军事集团已显得多么萎靡、绝望和老朽……但是，在苏联却四十一年如一日始终由社会主义胜利的鼓舞者和组织者共产党掌舵。四十一年如一日始终是由苏维埃政府，领导自己的人民不断地走向更高的共产主义的光辉顶峰。“衰老”和“萎靡”这样的词儿，对社会主义各民族是不适用的。在几年和几十年当中，社会主义各民族不是衰老而是年青了。苏联和中华人民共和国是如此，一切人民民主国家也都是如此。
    苏联以及整个社会主义阵营，越来越年青，越来越成长和壮大起来。我们在伟大的人民中国看到了和苏联所发生的同样现象。生活在沸腾着。人们充满了无穷无尽的精力。他们的双手从事着创造性的劳动。他们的头脑充满着广阔的思想和宏伟的计划。
    我们不预备评述过去一年的革命事件。我们只想极简略地谈几件充满惊人的奇迹并向前推进世界历史的几件事实。
    在庆祝十月革命四十一周年时，苏联全国正在认真地筹备苏共第二十一次代表大会和迎接新的七年计划。全国正在准备在走向共产主义的道路上实行生龙活虎般的跃进。全世界在苏维埃政权的历次五年计划中早已看到过经济与文化方面的巨大成就。那样的时代早已过去了，当时资产阶级思想家看到苏联增长速度的指标时，不相信他们自己的眼睛，并口口声声说：这是根本不可能的。现在他们相信了，他们知道这是会做到的，于是他们就策划用武力的强制手段来阻挡这一使他们震惊的不断的增长。这是妄想！1959—1965年的七年计划，甚至使那些早已不会感到吃惊的人，感到惊讶。
    问题不仅在于巨大的数目字，而是在于新的质量。苏联生产的新高涨，标志着新的关系、新的生活和新人的发展。如果说在社会主义的过去阶段苏联已经完全铲除了贫困，那末现在则是全体劳动人民物质福利要进一步大大提高，他们的全部切身利益有保障，他们的生活水平达到在资本主义制度下不可能达到的高度水平。社会主义不仅在劳动生产率，而且在保障全体劳动人民福利，以及物质与精神文化的空前发展方面，更加鲜明地显示出它对资本主义的优越性。这鼓舞着苏维埃人，不论是老年人和青年人，在斗争和劳动中作出新的功绩。创造的火焰，照亮了我们的心田和头脑。这火焰把铁炼成了钢，把人的心灵炼成了为建设共产主义新社会而进行忘我劳动的英雄气概。
    苏联共产党提出的在最短的时期内，在按人口计算的产品生产方面赶上和超过先进的资本主义国家的任务，已接近解决。现在，苏联已经是最强大的国家。将来它还要更加强大。它以镇定和藐视的目光，注视着企图挑起原子战争的苏联的敌人。那些企图挑起原子战争的人，是要倒霉的。不论这个战争使各国人民遭到多么大的痛苦，但它会致资本主义于死命，使共产主义获得胜利。苏联人民不需要战争，也不想发动战争。苏联人民和一切已经或正在从帝国主义压迫下解放的爱好和平的各国人民一样，需要和平。
    帝国主义在东奔西跑，到处乱窜。它害怕各国人民的巨大的怒潮。它不相信自己的力量，但是还在世界各地进行军事挑衅。它进攻埃及，遭到了可耻的失败。它钻进了叙利亚，但是在这里也碰了一鼻子灰。今年美帝国主义串通英帝国主义进攻了黎巴嫩和约旦。各国人民把它从这些地方赶走了。它在逃跑的时候，要人们相信它是自动走开的。阿拉伯联合共和国的诞生、阿拉伯各国的团结以及伊拉克从殖民压迫下得到了解放，——这些都是帝国主义失败的证据。阿拉伯各国人民之所以能够胜利，是因为有以苏联为首的社会主义和民主世界站在他们一边。“不许帝国主义干涉东方！”社会主义和民主世界庄严而又镇定地这样说道。于是帝国主义恶犬便夹着尾巴溜走了。
    但是，帝国主义并没有从不久以前的事情中吸取教训。现在它又在远东策动新的冒险。但是，在它和蒋介石败类面前竖立着伟大的人民中国这样一堵铜墙铁壁。美国还看到了中国人民的亲兄弟苏联，同人民中国并肩地站在一起。
    美帝国主义的挑衅在继续着。但是，在纪念伟大十月革命四十一周年时，我们可以举出以下一些意义重大的现象。社会主义和民主世界坚决一致地抗击任何侵略行为。兄弟般的友谊，使社会主义各民族结成了牢不可破的互助同盟。一切社会主义国家政府，都有一致的对外政策——和平与争取各国人民独立的政策。
    但是，帝国主义者的挑衅表现出了什么呢？在进攻埃及时，有英国、法国和以色列参加。大洋彼岸的美国暗中予以支持。其它的资本主义国家也帮助它们。
    在进攻黎巴嫩和约旦时，只有美国和英国参加。其它的资本主义国家采取旁观态度。
    美国在台湾海峡既没有同盟国，也没有伙伴，北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约组织都瘫痪了。
    社会主义世界在蒸蒸日上，资本主义世界已日暮途穷。
    现在发生了不久以前资产阶级思想家还意想不到，并认为不可能的事情。
    美帝国主义对全世界大吹大擂说他们将对需要经济援助的一切国家给予经济援助。美国总统像一个拿鸡毛当令箭的人一样，把这个援助计划当宝贝。但是，实际上美帝国主义者不曾给予任何人真正的援助，因为在他们观念中的经济援助，就是供给美式武器准备进行反对苏联、人民中国，反对整个社会主义阵营的战争。几乎所有国家的人民都拒绝这种援助。
    苏联不声不响，不吹不擂，毫不夸耀他给不发达国家以真正的援助，援助它们物质资料、商品和派遣技术顾问，而不附加任何奴役性的或是军事的条件。这种援助是真正出自友谊，是大公无私的。
    埃及人民早就要求资本主义世界援助他们修建尼罗河上的水坝，以保障国家的切身利益。美帝国主义答应给予这种援助的条件，是要埃及回到法老时代，要埃及农民当美国法老资本的奴隶。但是，自豪的埃及人民拒绝了这一向二十世纪的美国法老屈膝的条件。纽约交易所拒绝给埃及人民以必要的信贷来修建阿斯旺大水坝。帝国主义者幸灾乐祸，袖手旁观，他们认为如果他们不出钱，那么任何人也不会给埃及人钱。他们大错特错了。世界上已经有这样一种力量，它能够帮助弱小民族。这就是社会主义的力量。在伟大十月革命四十一周年的前夕，苏联人民慷慨无私地提供了物资和技术来援助尼罗河上的阿斯旺水坝的建设工程。尽管苏联本国的宏伟建设需要大量资金，但这并不妨碍苏联人民援助自己的朋友们。这使全体苏联人民体会到了自己的力量。在这方面也表现出社会主义比资本主义的优越性。我们引以为自豪的，是在我们时代的一个最大的工程中，有我们劳动和我们文化的一份。
    资本主义西方的火焰快要熄灭了。经济危机的凄风苦雨吹灭了美国的炼钢炉和炼铁炉。美国西部的大片土地荒芜了，杂草丛生，砂砾遍地，成千上万的农民，几十万和上百万的失业者到处流浪，绝望地寻找工作和面包。学校里的火焰快要熄灭了，在种族仇视中人们变得野蛮了。资产阶级的文明，已是蜡尽烛残的时光了。
    但是在社会主义国家，革命的创造火焰却日益光芒万丈。在可诅咒的过去的废墟上，一批批新的充满光辉的大厦在兴起。中小学校和大学不断增加。自由的科学在试验所里创造着奇迹。以科学知识武装了的人类，正在越出地球的大气层，进入广漠无垠的宇宙空间。苏联人造地球卫星，这是天然的共产主义卫星。围绕地球运转的这些卫星，预告着新的、光辉的、万人尽欢的时代（整个地球幸福的时代）的到来。
