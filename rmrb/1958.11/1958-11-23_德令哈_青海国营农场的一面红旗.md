    DeLingHa
    A Red Flag on the Qinghai State-Owned Farm
    When I arrived at the DeLingHa Farm in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province, the spring wheat here was already ripe. The plants were strong, and the grains were full, growing exceptionally well. Recent actual yield results show that the average yield of spring wheat planted on over 14,000 mu across the farm reached over 1,200 jin per mu; and 1.07 mu of experimental fields achieved a high yield of 5,743 jin and 6 liang per mu. In this high-altitude and frigid region with an elevation of more than 2,800 meters and a frost-free period of only about 90 days, achieving such a high and abundant yield of spring wheat can be considered a miracle.
    Diverse Economy, All-Round Development
    In this farm, the peas, soybeans, rapeseed, potatoes and other crops planted this year are growing very well. The highland barley and rapeseed have also produced high-yield "satellites" of 4,974 jin and 14 liang and 2,161 jin and 11 liang per mu respectively. The vegetables grown by the farm, such as cabbage, green onions, vegetable melons, and radishes, not only meet the needs of the farm's staff but can also supply a large amount for the geological prospecting personnel in Qaidam to eat. The farm has also successfully experimented with cultivating fine vegetables and melons and fruits such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and sweet melons this year, which can be planted on a large scale next year. For people working in the basin, being able to eat tomatoes and sweet melons produced in the basin is indeed an encouraging thing!
    Since its establishment in 1954, DeLingHa Farm has developed diversified operations and implemented the principle of supporting the farm with its own operations. Over the past few years, the farm has successively built 41 factories for oil pressing, flour milling, non-staple food processing, sugar making, winemaking, clothing, brick and tile making, lime making, and machine tool repair, with an estimated output value of more than 3.6 million yuan by the end of the year, capable of turning over profits of 840,000 yuan. Now, the farm can not only be self-sufficient in staple foods and major non-staple foods, but also manufacture livestock machinery and ball bearings. Overhauls of tractors and automobiles can also be resolved by themselves. After the Party Central Committee put forward the slogan of "the whole party running industry, the whole people running industry," the farm also organized manpower to engage in mining, steel smelting, and other industries. More than ten kinds of minerals have now been mined. Since 1955, the farm has also established livestock teams for horses, cattle, and sheep, and paid attention to pig breeding. The number of pigs on the farm is expected to reach more than 11,000 by the end of this year.
    Making Do with What You Have, Running the Farm Diligently and Frugally
    The policy of "running the farm diligently and frugally" has been well implemented at DeLingHa Farm. The farm's existing buildings, with an area of more than 78,000 square meters, are mostly made of earth and wood, except for a few production workshops. Reed is used instead of wood for roofing panels and cave dwellings, and most of the tables, benches, and sofas are made of adobe. These two items alone have reduced the state's investment by more than 154,000 yuan in timber costs. Other facilities, such as medical care, schools, and recreational and sports activities, have also been gradually developed based on the principles of "making do with what you have, using local materials," and "production first, welfare second." To date, the welfare facilities on the farm account for only 4.13% of the total investment.
    Because this farm has implemented the policy of "running the farm diligently and frugally" and vigorously developed diversified operations, it turned over a profit of more than 120,000 yuan to the state in the first year of its establishment, breaking the convention of "no profit turned over for three years after the establishment of the farm." Subsequently, the profits turned over have increased year by year, and it is estimated that a profit of 1.42 million yuan can be turned over this year. In addition, DeLingHa Farm has also helped establish four other farms: Gobi, Saishike, and Chachaxiangka.
    "DeLingHa People"
    Now, on this thousand-year-old desolate grassland, more than 72,000 mu of land have been cultivated, with crisscrossing canals, accessible transportation, numerous factories, and herds of cattle and sheep. Postal and telecommunications, trade, banking, and other units have established institutions here. The howling of wolves and foxes has been replaced by the roar of machines.
    Seeing this tremendous change, one naturally thinks of the people working here. In March 1954, Farm Director Hao Dengge and others accepted the task assigned by the Party and came to DeLingHa with more than 1,600 people to establish the farm. They set off from Xining by car, trekking through mountains and rivers, building roads as they advanced, and it took them 22 days to travel more than 530 kilometers. Spring is a windy season in Qaidam, and their tents were often blown down by the wind. Sometimes, flour was not supplied in time, so they cooked highland barley to eat. The most distressing problem for everyone was the lack of production knowledge and tools. At that time, there was only one intermediate agricultural technician who had just graduated from school. No one could guide them in surveying and designing, road building, ditch digging, watering, and planting. However, in the face of heroic people, there are no insurmountable difficulties. They learned while doing, and did while learning, working with high morale. After sowing, they watered the fields, but because there was no soil loosening, the ground was compacted, and seedlings could not emerge, so they used the nails for pitching tents to dig the soil and help the seedlings emerge. Without plows, they used modified shovels as substitutes. Under such difficult conditions, they reclaimed more than 23,600 mu of land that year, rushed to plant more than 8,200 mu of various crops, and achieved an all-round bumper harvest with an average yield of 298 jin of wheat and 305 jin of highland barley per mu.
    At DeLingHa Farm, I have visited and contacted many people, and they all expressed a deep affection for this place, saying that they would work on the farm for the rest of their lives and continue to build this place with their own hands. Deputy Farm Director Ma Zhilong is most fond of conducting various plant cultivation experiments. The apricot trees, mulberry trees, and maple trees in the Fourth Production Station were all cultivated by him personally. Deputy Farm Director Chen Fusheng was originally an old Red Army soldier who knew nothing about industry, but because he was willing to work hard and study diligently, he has found more than ten large and small mineral deposits this year. Even the girls who came here from large cities such as Shanghai have now deeply fallen in love with this beautiful and rich place. Some people proudly call themselves "DeLingHa people." Their selfless working attitude and outstanding work achievements have been praised by Vice Chairman Zhu De and the responsible comrades of the Qinghai Provincial Party and government. In August of this year, the central competent authorities also held an on-site meeting of state-owned farms in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces (autonomous regions) here to promote and exchange the work and production experience of this farm.

    德令哈
    青海国营农场的一面红旗
    当我来到青海省柴达木盆地德令哈农场的时候，这里的春小麦已经成熟了。株壮粒饱，长得实在好。最近实收的结果，全场播种的一万四千多亩春小麦，平均亩产达到一千二百斤以上；还有一点零七亩试验田、亩产高达五千七百四十三斤六两。在这拔海二千八百多公尺，无霜期只有九十天左右的高寒地区、春小麦能够获得这样的高额丰产，应该说是一个奇迹。
    多种经济　样样发展
    在这个农场里，今年播种的豌豆、大豆、油菜、马铃薯等农作物，都生长得很好。青稞、油菜并分别出现了亩产四千九百七十四斤十四两和二千一百六十一斤十一两的高产“卫星”。农场种的白菜、大葱、菜瓜、萝卜等蔬菜，不仅满足了农场工作人员的需要，还可以大量供应柴达木勘探人员吃用。农场今年还试验培育成功西红柿、黄瓜、甜瓜等细菜和瓜果，明年就可大量种植。对于在盆地工作的人来说，能够吃到盆地产的西红柿和甜瓜，这的确是一件令人鼓舞的事情！
    德令哈农场从1954年建场以来，就开展多种经营，实行以场养场。几年来，农场先后建起了榨油、面粉、副食加工、制糖、酿酒、被服、砖瓦、石灰和机具修配等四十一个工厂，预计年底产值可达三百六十多万元，能上交利润八十四万元。现在农场不仅主食和主要副食可以自给，而且畜力机具、滚珠轴承等都能自制。拖拉机、汽车的中修也可以自己解决。党中央提出“全党办工业、全民办工业”的口号以后，农场又组织人力，大闹矿山开采、钢铁冶炼等工业。现在已经开采的矿产就有十多种。从1955年开始，农场还建立了马、牛、羊等畜牧队，并注意了养猪事业，场里的毛猪到今年年底可发展到一万一千多口。
    因陋就简　　勤俭办场
    “勤俭办场”的方针在德令哈农场贯彻执行得很好。农场现有的七万八千多平方公尺面积的房屋，除几处生产车间外，都是土木结构。屋面板和供窑洞用的木料都用芦苇代替，桌凳、沙发绝大部分都是用土坯作的。仅这两项节省的木料费就减少国家投资十五万四千多元。其他如医疗、学校和文娱体育活动等设施，也都是在“因陋就简、就地取材”和“先生产、后福利”的原则下，逐步发展起来的。到目前，全场的福利设施还只占总投资的4.13％。
    这个农场由于贯彻执行了“勤俭办场”的方针，大力开展了多种经营，所以在建场的第一年就给国家上交利润十二万多元，打破了“建场三年无利上交”的常规。以后上交利润逐年有所增加，预计今年可上交利润一百四十二万元。另外，德令哈农场还帮助建立了戈壁、赛什克、查查香卡等四个农场。
    “德令哈人”
    现在，在这千年荒寂的草原上，已经垦种的土地有七万二千多亩，渠道纵横，交通四通八达，工厂林立，牛羊成群，邮电、贸易、银行等单位都在这里建立了机构。狼、狐的啸叫已被机器的轰鸣所代替。
    看见这种巨大的变化，很自然地就会想起在这里工作的人们。1954年3月，郝登阁场长等人接受了党交给的任务，带着一千六百多人来到德令哈建场。他们从西宁坐汽车出发，一路翻山涉水，边修路边前进，五百三十多公里路程走了二十二天才到达。春天，柴达木正是多风的季节，他们的帐房常被大风吹倒。有时面粉供应不上，他们就煮青稞吃。最使大家感到苦恼的问题是缺乏生产知识和生产工具。那时全场只有一个刚从学校毕业的中级农业技术人员。勘查设计，修路挖渠，浇水播种，都没有人指导。但是，在英雄的人们面前，没有克服不了的困难。他们边做边学，边学边做，斗志昂扬地干了起来。下种后浇水，因为没有松土，地面板结，出不了苗，他们就用钉帐房的钉子挖土，帮助出苗。没有犁，他们用板镢改装代替。就在这种十分困难的条件下，他们当年开荒二万三千六百多亩，抢种各种作物八千二百多亩，并且获得了小麦平均亩产二百九十八斤和青稞平均亩产三百零五斤的全面丰收。
    在德令哈农场，我曾访问和接触过很多人，他们都流露出对这个地方的深厚感情，表示要在农场干一辈子，用他们的双手继续建设这个地方。马治龙副场长最喜欢搞各种植物的栽培试验，第四作业站上的杏树、桑树和枫树，都是他亲手栽培成功的。陈复生副场长原来是一个对工业一窍不通的红军老战士，但是由于他肯干肯钻，今年已经找到了十多个大、小矿点。就连从上海等大城市来这里的姑娘们，现在也都深深地爱上了这个美丽富饶的地方。有的人还骄傲地自称是“德令哈人”。他们的这种忘我的工作态度和出色的工作成绩，曾得到朱德副主席和青海省党、政负责同志的表扬。今年8月间，中央主管部门还在这里召开了甘肃、青海、宁夏三省（自治区）国营农场现场会议，推广交流了这个农场的工作和生产经验。
