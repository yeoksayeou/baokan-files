    Soviet Union Publishes Third Edition of "Textbook of Political Economy"
    The third edition of the "Textbook of Political Economy," compiled by the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, was published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House at the end of October. The Chinese version is currently being translated and will be published by the People's Publishing House.
    Compared with the second edition, the third edition has some structural changes and many revisions and supplements in terms of content. The part on the socialist mode of production has been revised and supplemented the most. Regarding this part, the preface to the third edition states:
    "In preparing the third edition of the textbook, the authors strived to make a more detailed theoretical analysis of the economic laws and categories of socialism, their manifestations, and the ways in which they are used in the practice of planned management of the socialist economy. Therefore, theoretical issues related to the further development of Lenin's principle of democratic centralism in economic construction, as well as theoretical issues related to the characteristics of the planned management of collective farm production based on cooperative collective farm ownership, are more widely elaborated in the textbook.
    "In the textbook, greater importance has been given to the following issues: the role of the law of value, especially its role in the field of production of the means of production and in the economic activities of collective farms; strengthening economic accounting; developing material incentives for increasing production, improving labor productivity, and reducing costs; and realizing all the advantages of socialist planned economy as fully as possible in order to accelerate the solution of the Soviet Union's basic economic tasks and build the material and productive base of communism."

    苏联出版“政治经济学教科书”第三版
    苏联科学院经济研究所编写的“政治经济学教科书”第三版，已由苏联国家政治书籍出版局在10月底出版。中文本现已进行翻译，将由人民出版社出版。
    第三版同第二版比较，在结构上有一些变动，在内容上也有不少修改和补充。修改和补充得最多的是社会主义生产方式部分。关于这一部分，第三版的序言里说：
    “在准备教科书的第三版时，作者力求对社会主义的经济规律和范畴，它们的表现形式和在社会主义经济的计划领导的实践中利用的方式，作出更详细的理论分析。因此，同在经济建设中进一步发展列宁的民主集中原则有关的理论问题，以及同以合作社集体农庄所有制形式为基础的集体农庄生产发展的计划领导的特点有关的理论问题，在教科书中得到更广泛的阐述。
    “在教科书中，对于以下问题给予了更加重要的地位：价值规律的作用问题，特别是它在生产资料生产的领域和在集体农庄的经济活动中的作用问题；巩固经济核算问题；发展增加生产，提高劳动生产率和降低成本的物质鼓励问题；为加速解决苏联的基本经济任务和建成共产主义的物质生产基础而尽可能充分地实现社会主义计划经济的一切优越性问题。”
