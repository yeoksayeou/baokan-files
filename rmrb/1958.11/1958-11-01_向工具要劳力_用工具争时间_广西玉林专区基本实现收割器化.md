Using Tools to Free Labor, Using Tools to Compete for Time
Yulin Prefecture, Guangxi, Basically Achieves Harvester Mechanization

(According to Guangxi Daily) Yulin Prefecture vigorously carried out a tool reform movement for the autumn harvest. As of October 21, the entire prefecture had manufactured more than 182,000 harvesters. Based on the current labor force participating in the autumn harvest in the entire prefecture, there is an average of one for every three-plus people, basically achieving harvester mechanization.

In September, the prefecture held an on-site tool reform meeting in Beiliu, arranging for each county to resolutely carry out tool reform. All localities, through extensive debates, presented the situation, calculated labor accounts, and fully recognized that the characteristics of this year's autumn harvest work are: concentrated work, large volume, and insufficient labor. The prefectural committee required that this year's autumn harvest be basically completed by November 10 in order to gain the initiative. This requires vigorous tool reform, especially the promotion of harvesters. Qianjin Commune in Beiliu County calculated a detailed account. The entire commune had 4,588 laborers left behind. Harvesting 25,000 mu of late rice would take 130 days if the old method of autumn harvest was used. If harvesters, threshers, and trucks are used for transportation, it can be reduced to 25 days. The experimental results of Shuanglong Work Area of Fengshan Commune in Bobai showed that using a hand sickle to harvest each person could harvest 0.3 mu per day, and it would take 25 days to harvest all the late rice. If a harvester is used, one person can harvest 2 to 3 mu per day, so it can be harvested in 6 days. Through debate and trial use of harvesters, everyone realized that harvesters must be vigorously developed. After recognizing the importance of tool reform, each commune in Luchuan County immediately extracted nine township committee members to specifically lead this work. Qianjin Commune in Beiliu put forward the slogan of extracting labor from tools and extracting time from tools, and vigorously launched a mass movement for tool reform, dispatching more than 2,700 people to make 2,962 harvesters in just two days.

The entire district basically achieved harvester mechanization in the context of transferring a large number of laborers to support steel production and leaving few laborers in the rear. The Yulin Prefectural Committee issued two instructions successively, emphasizing that tool reform should involve a large-scale mass movement, with everyone taking action. The deadline for achieving harvester mechanization was October 20. It is necessary to correct the phenomenon of relying solely on craftsmen to take action slowly. According to instructions, all localities immediately mobilized the masses to have craftsmen impart technology, drive the masses, and have everyone take action, first breaking through the technical barrier.

In the mass movement for tool reform, all localities also mobilized the masses to contribute iron and find wood. Ningtan Commune in Bobai was short of more than 9,000 jin of iron, which was solved by mobilizing commune members to contribute iron.

In order to ensure the quality of the harvesters, all localities also implemented the method of manufacturing and inspecting at the same time during tool reform, so that the harvesters could ensure quality. After manufacturing, harvesters were also trained in a timely manner, teaching everyone how to use them.

    向工具要劳力  用工具争时间
    广西玉林专区基本实现收割器化
    据广西日报消息　玉林专区大力开展秋收工具改革运动，至10月21日，全区制出收割器十八万二千多部，按全专区目前参加秋收的劳力计算，平均每三个多人有一架，基本实现收割器化。
    这个专区9月间就在北流召开了工具改革现场会议，布置各县坚决搞好工具改革。各地都通过大辩论摆情况，算劳力账，充分认识到今年秋收工作的特点是：工作集中、量大、劳力不足，而地委要求今年秋收在11月10日基本结束，以便争取主动。这就必须大搞工具改革，特别是推广收割器。北流县前进公社算了一个细账，全公社留后方的劳动力四千五百八十八人，二万五千亩晚糙，如按老办法秋收，要做一百三十天，才能收割完；如用收割器、打谷机和用车子运输，可缩为二十五天。博白凤山公社双龙工区试验结果，用手镰刀收割每人每天收三分，全部晚稻要二十五天才能收割完；如用收割器一人一天可割二至三亩，这样六天可收割完。通过辩论和试用收割器，使大家认识到，必须大搞收割器。陆川县各公社认识工具改革的重要后，九个公社即抽出九个乡委委员专门领导这一工作。北流前进公社提出要向工具索取劳力，向工具索取时间的口号，大搞工具改革群众运动，出动二千七百多人，仅两天时间做出收割器二千九百六十二个。
    全区基本实现收割器化，是在抽调大批劳力支援钢铁生产，留在后方的劳力不多的情况下进行的。玉林地委先后发出两次指示，强调工具改革要大搞群众运动，人人动手，限期在10月20日实现收割器化，必须纠正光依靠工匠动手，慢吞吞的现象。各地根据指示立即发动群众以工匠传授技术，带动群众，人人动手，首先攻破技术关。
    各地在大搞工具改革群众运动中，还发动群众献铁、找木料。博白宁潭公社缺铁九千多斤，发动社员献铁就解决了。
    为保证收割器的质量，各地在搞工具改革中，还贯彻边制造、边检查的办法，使收割器能保证质量。在制造后，还及时训练收割手，教会人人使用。
