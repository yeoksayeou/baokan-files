New Type of Quick Harvester
Five Times More Efficient Than Manual Labor, One Time More Efficient Than Old Harvesters

The new type of quick harvester recently modified in Zhejiang Province is an improved version of the quick harvester from Hunan.

The features, structure, and usage of this new type of quick harvester are introduced below:

Features

1.  Fast Harvesting, High Efficiency: According to test results, each person can harvest four to six mu per day (based on ten hours), which is three to five times more efficient than manual labor; it is also about one time more efficient than the original quick harvester.
2.  Able to Harvest Lodged Rice: It is not only suitable for harvesting upright rice, but also suitable for harvesting rice that has lodged up to fifteen degrees (i.e., rice that has lodged to the point of almost touching the mud). For rice that has lodged below fifteen degrees or above sixteen degrees, it can also be harvested as long as a "bamboo bow rice support frame" is installed on the right or left side of the rice collecting frame. This is its most superior feature. In addition, it can be used in both paddy fields and dry fields.
3.  Easy to Master the Technique: It only takes more than an hour to learn.
4.  Labor-Saving Operation: Women and semi-able-bodied people can use it.
5.  Simple Structure, Low Cost: It only requires a small amount of iron, wood, and bamboo materials, and can be manufactured by blacksmiths and carpenters in the people's communes. The cost per unit is only about three yuan.

Structure

The structure is very simple, consisting of three parts: a wooden handle (bamboo can also be used), a rice collecting frame, and a sickle. The wooden handle is installed on the rice collecting frame through a support rod, and the bottom is connected to the sickle; the rice collecting frame is made of bamboo strips and small wooden strips, forming a trapezoidal frame that is low in the front and high in the back. The two small wooden strips at the bottom form a boat-shaped bottom, with the tip slightly upturned, and the bottom should be higher than the sickle.

The rice collecting frame has two functions: first, to separate the rice and also to lift up the more severely lodged rice into the sickle for cutting; second, to hold the cut rice inside.

The sickle consists of two blades, the cutting edge of the blade is serrated, and mixed with steel. A gap of one millimeter must be left in the middle where the two blades meet, and a square hole is left at the place where the tails of the two blades meet, so that the remaining grass can leak down through the gap of the small square hole, which can avoid the blades being blocked by rice straw and affecting work. There are three holes each on the top of the tail of the two blades, and iron nails are passed through the holes and nailed to the bottom of the wooden handle. The tips of the two blades are fixed in the boat-shaped wooden strips on both sides to prevent the sickle from shaking.

Usage

1.  When using, hold the handle with one hand and the wooden handle with the other, or hold the handle with both hands, and push forward. Push one row at a time. If the plant spacing is very dense, more than fifty clusters can be cut at once and placed in a pile.
2.  When cutting rice, the height distance between the tip of the sickle and the ground should be appropriate. If the sickle is tilted upward too high, it will not cut; if it is too low downward, it will insert into the mud.
3.  When pushing forward, if you find it difficult to push, it is because the cutting edge of the sickle is blocked. At this time, you should not continue to cut, but should unload the already cut rice, and remove the remaining grass from the sickle before cutting again, otherwise, it will be difficult to push, cut off, or cut cleanly.
4.  When the sickle has been used for a long time, residual grass is often entangled on it, and attention must be paid to cleaning it frequently. Otherwise, the phenomenon of unclean cutting or inability to push will occur.
5.  The speed of pushing forward should be faster.
6.  The method of harvesting should be determined according to the actual situation. The general principle is: choose very straight rows to harvest, and if the degree of lodging is slight, you can harvest in the direction of lodging, or you can cut horizontally in the direction of lodging. But if the degree of lodging is very serious, you must cut horizontally in the direction of lodging.
7.  When the rice is cut off and fully loaded in the rice collecting frame and needs to be unloaded on the ground, the harvester can be erected, and the rice will fall down accordingly. At this time, you only need to step on it with your foot to unload it on the ground.

### 新式快速收割器  比人工提高效率五倍比旧收割器提高效率一倍

    新式快速收割器
    比人工提高效率五倍比旧收割器提高效率一倍
    浙江省最近改制的新式快速收割器是在湖南的快速收割器的基础上改进成功的。
    现将这种新式快速收割器的特点、构造和使用方法分别介绍如下：
            特点
    1、割得快工效高：据试验结果，每天（以十小时计算）每人可割四到六亩，比人工提高工效三到五倍；比原来的快速收割器还要提高工效一倍左右。
    2、能收割倒伏的稻：它不但很适合收割竖立的稻，而且也适合收割倒伏程度达十五度的稻（即倒伏到快要着泥的稻）。对倒伏程度达十五度以下、十六度以上的稻，只要在装稻架的右侧或左侧安装上“竹弓扶稻架”也可以收割。这是它最优越的地方。此外，无论在水田或干田也都能使用。
    3、技术容易掌握：一个多钟头就可以学会。
    4、操作省力：妇女、半劳力都可以使用。
    5、结构简单成本低廉：只需少量铁、木、竹材料，人民公社的铁匠和木匠都可以制造，每部成本只需三元左右。
            构造
    构造非常简单，由木手柄（也可用竹代替）、装稻架、镰刀等三部分构成。木手柄通过一根支条安装在装稻架上，底部与镰刀相接；装稻架由竹片与小木条制成，上面形成一个前低后高的梯形架子，底部的两根小木条形成船底形，尖端稍向上翘起，底部要高出镰刀。
    装稻架的作用有二：一是将稻分开，还可把倒伏较严重的稻扶起进入镰刀，以便切割；二是将割下的稻装在里面。
    镰刀由两块刀片组成，刀片刃口部分是锯齿形的，掺有钢。两块刀片相吻合的中部，必须留出一公厘的缝，两块刀片尾部相合处并留一个方孔，残草通过小方孔间隙漏下，能避免刀片堵塞稻草而影响工作。两块刀片的最尾部上面各有三个孔，铁钉就从孔中穿过钉在木手柄的底部。两块刀片的尖端固定在两边的船形木条内，以免镰刀晃动。
          使用方法
    1、使用时，一手握住柄把，一手握住木柄或两手握住柄把上，向前推进。一次推一行。株距很密的，一次能割五十多丛，放成一堆。
    2、割稻时，镰刀尖端与地面的高度距离要适当，如镰刀向上翘得过高，就会割不断；如向下过低，则会插入泥内。
    3、推着向前行进时，如发现推不动，这是因为镰刀刃口上被堵塞了。这时不应继续再割，而应把已割的稻卸掉，并将镰刀上的残草加以清除后再割，否则会有推动费力、割不断或割不净的毛病发生。
    4、镰刀收割时间久了，常有残草缠在上面，必须注意经常清除。否则将会发生割不净或推不动的现象。
    5、向前推进的速度，以快一些为好。
    6、收割的方法，应看实际情况确定。一般的原则是：选择很直的行子收割，倒伏程度轻微的，可以按倒伏的方向收割，也可按倒伏的方向横割。但如果倒伏程度很严重的，就必须按倒伏的方向横割。
    7、当稻割断满装在装稻架而需要卸掉在地面上的时候，可将收割器立起，稻就顺着向下倒去，这时只需要用脚踩一下，即可卸掉在地上。
