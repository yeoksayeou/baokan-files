    Red Flags Flutter in the Arctic Circle
    —A First Visit to the Soviet Arctic Region
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Li Nan
    In the minds of most people, the Arctic is generally thought of as a desolate, frigid, and lifeless wilderness. However, in the Soviet Arctic region, one gets an entirely different impression. Here, life is bustling, and the working people and scientists, like those in other parts of the Soviet Union, are enthusiastically and diligently engaged in the great cause of communist construction, living a comfortable and wonderful life like their counterparts in other parts of the Soviet Union.

    This was the first impression gained by the reporter and a group of Soviet and foreign journalists as they set foot on the Soviet land within the Arctic Circle.

    Nights Stretch for Months, Wonderful Scenery Captivates
    Here, we learned about the lives of the working people and scientists in the Soviet Arctic region, as well as their diligent and courageous work, and also admired the enchanting scenery of the long Arctic nights.

    Now, the severe and wondrous Arctic night has descended. This magnificent spectacle of nature gives the cities and villages of the Arctic region a unique charm.

    From November onwards, most areas within the Arctic Circle are submerged in months of continuous darkness. The sun is not visible in the sky, and there is no bright daylight. In some areas, the sky may brighten slightly at noon, resembling a twilight moonlit night or the hazy scenery of a dawning morning. Areas closer to the Arctic center are completely shrouded in darkness. Bright daylight cannot penetrate, and the faint glimmer of dawn is quickly replaced by the scene of dusk.

    The plane of the Arctic Air Force we were traveling on flew northeast via Arkhangelsk, crossed the mouth of the Ob River, and then flew north along the Yenisei River. The further north we flew, the longer the Arctic night became. Further ahead, we were flying entirely in darkness.

    Glimmering Cold Stars Accompany the Cold Moon, Colorful Bands of Light Abound
    The spectacle of the Arctic night is truly magnificent. The ground is covered with a meter-thick layer of white snow. Rivers and seas are entirely covered in ice and snow. When the weather is clear, the cold Arctic sky stretches out boundlessly, and the North Star twinkles overhead. Streaks of colorful light appear in the sky from time to time. These bands of light move constantly, transforming into thousands of beautiful scenes, suddenly extinguishing completely, leaving behind glimmering cold stars and a cold moon. This is the famous Aurora Borealis.

    The Arctic is, after all, the Arctic. In winter, the climate and living conditions here are severe and frigid. The mercury in the thermometer is frozen and contracted, shrinking to minus thirty degrees Celsius. Ice and snow seal the earth. The north wind roars, and the Arctic gale reaches force twelve.

    Braving the Cold Wind to Compete, Chisel Through the Ice to Catch Big Fish
    However, no matter how fierce the wind or how cold the weather, in the vast Soviet Arctic region, working life continues to bustle, and the construction of communism never stops for a moment. The whistles of factories and the sounds of machines break through the silence of the Arctic, and workers, under the twinkling stars and amid the roaring north wind, head to their production posts. Factory production continues non-stop. To welcome the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, workers are currently engaged in enthusiastic labor competitions.

    Air transport continues in the Arctic night. Brave and experienced Arctic pilots deliver grain and newspapers to the Arctic people and staff in a timely manner. The two major economic sectors of the Arctic region—fishing and hunting—are constantly active. Hunters drive dog-sleds across the white snowy fields, chasing valuable wild animals. Members of fishing cooperatives chisel through the ice on the snow, and drop fishing nets. Meteorologists and scientists continuously conduct scientific research and weather reporting.

    Cities Rise from the Vast Wilderness, Spring Breezes Blow Through the Arctic Circle
    In the dark Arctic night, within the cold Arctic Circle, the working people live a bright and warm life. Thanks to the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, they still have milk, potatoes, and vegetables even in winter. No matter how cold it is outside, it is always so warm indoors, like a warm spring night. Urban construction in the Arctic region is booming. This used to be a wilderness, but in the Soviet era, one modern city after another has risen.

    Now, cities and ethnic regions here are discussing the Soviet Seven-Year Plan. Everyone recognizes that this plan is a plan to accelerate the construction of communism. It will also accelerate the transformation of the Arctic region. Industry, agriculture, culture, and transportation in the Arctic Circle will be further developed, maritime transport will be unprecedentedly developed, and the Soviet people's cause of conquering the Arctic region will be further advanced.

    The scenery of the Arctic night is enchanting, and the Aurora Borealis is indeed beautiful and brilliant. However, in the Soviet Arctic region, the light of communism is even more enchanting, even more beautiful, leaving an unforgettable impression on visitors.

    北极圈内红旗飘
    ——初访苏维埃北极区域
    新华社记者　李楠
    北极，在一般人的心目中，总认为是茫无人迹、酷寒死寂的荒野。但是，在苏维埃北极区域，人们得到的完全是另一种印象。这里，生活在沸腾着，这里的劳动人民和科学工作者，像在苏联其它地方一样，在热情、紧张地从事着伟大的共产主义建设，他们过着像苏联其它地方一样的舒适、美好的生活。
    这就是记者同一批苏联和外国记者踏入北极圈内的苏维埃大地上获得的第一个印象。
    黑夜绵延长数月  奇妙风光令人迷
    我们在这里了解了苏维埃北极区域劳动人民和科学工作者的生活，以及他们的勤劳勇敢的劳动，也欣赏到了北极漫漫长夜的迷人风光。
    现在，严峻奇妙的北极夜已经降临。这一大自然的奇妙景象使得北极地区的城市和乡村更具有一番独特的景色。
    从11月份起，北极圈以内的大部分地区，连续几个月沉没在漫长的黑夜中。天空中见不到太阳，也没有明亮的白昼。有些地区在中午的时候，天色还会稍稍明亮，像黄昏的月夜或晨光熹微的朦胧景色。靠近北极中心地区，却完全笼罩在黑夜中。明亮的白日闯不进来，微茫的黎明曙光很快就被黄昏景象所代替了。
    我们乘坐的一架北极航空队的飞机，是经过阿尔汉格尔，向东北飞行，跨过鄂毕河的入海口，然后沿着叶尼塞河再向北飞行的。越向北飞行，北极夜的时间就越长。再向前去，就完全是在黑暗中飞行了。
    点点寒星伴冷月  条条光带色缤纷
    北极夜的景象是蔚为奇观的。大地上覆盖着一片一公尺厚的白雪。河流和海洋全部为冰雪覆盖。在天气晴朗的时候，北极寒冷的星空一望无际，北极星在头顶上闪烁。一条条彩色缤纷的光带不时在天空中出现。光带不断移动，幻变出千万种美丽的景色，突然一下完全熄灭，留下点点寒星和一轮冷月，这就是著名的北极光。
    北极究竟还是北极。在冬天，这里的气候和生活条件是严峻和酷寒的。温度表里的水银柱也冻得蜷缩起来，缩到了零下三十度。冰雪封住了大地。北风怒吼，北极的寒风达到了十二级。
    冲破寒风搞竞赛  凿开坚冰捕大鱼
    但是，不管风如何猛烈，天气多么寒冷，在广大的苏维埃北极地区，劳动生活依然在沸腾，共产主义的建设一刻也没有停止。工厂的汽笛和机器声冲破了北极的寂静，工人们在星光的闪耀下，在北风的怒吼中，走向生产岗位。工厂的生产不断进行。为了迎接苏共第二十一次代表大会，目前工人们都在热烈进行着劳动竞赛。
    在北极夜里，航空运输仍在进行中。勇敢的、富有经验的北极飞行员们，将粮食和书报及时供应给北极人民和北极工作人员。北极地区两大经济部门——捕渔业和猎兽业，不停地在活动。猎人们驾驶着用狗拉的雪橇，在一片白雪的原野上追逐珍贵的野兽。渔业合作社的社员们在冰雪上凿开坚冰，放下渔网。气象工作者和科学家们毫不间断地进行着科学研究和气象报告工作。
    茫茫荒野城市起  管教春风度极圈
    在黑暗的北极长夜里，在寒冷的北极圈内，劳动人民过着光明的、温暖的生活。由于发展了农业和畜牧业，这里甚至在冬天都照样有牛奶、马铃薯和蔬菜。不管室外多么冷，室内却总是那么暖和，就像温暖的春夜一般。北极地区的城市建设正在蓬勃发展。这里曾经是一片荒野，但在苏维埃年代，一座又一座的现代化城市耸立了起来。
    现在，这里各城市和民族区都在讨论苏联七年远景发展计划。大家认识到这个计划是加速共产主义建设的计划。它也将加速北极地区面貌的改变，北极圈内的工业、农业、文化、交通事业将进一步发展，海上的航运将空前发达，苏联人民征服北极地区的事业也将进一步推进。
    北极夜的景色是迷人的，北极光的确是美丽、灿烂的。但是，在苏维埃北极区域，共产主义的光芒更是迷人，更加美丽，给来访的人留下难忘的印象。
