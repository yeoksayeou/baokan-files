Sending Warmth to the Steel Front
Gansu, Shanxi, and Heilongjiang Actively Arrange for Steel Workers to Spend the Winter
Snowflakes Flutter, Molten Iron Reflects Red
Underground Shelters Keep Warm, Earthen Furnaces Make for a Good Winter

According to the Gansu Daily, in the iron smelting sites of Huicheng and Kang Counties, Gansu Province, in order to ensure that everyone is in high spirits and that every furnace produces iron normally, various sites have taken a series of measures to strengthen cold-weather preparations, so that workers can spend the winter safely.

Since late September, Jianglu, Shuiquan, Niyang, Huangzhu, and other townships in Huicheng County have successively launched campaigns to support the iron smelting sites with thousands of sets of cotton clothes and tens of thousands of pairs of shoes. Niyang Township has already transported more than forty sets of cotton clothes to the site. Shuiquan Township's Youhao People's Commune alone has contributed 104 pieces of cotton-padded clothes, wool sweaters, single clothes, and lined clothes. They are now rushing to make shoes, proposing that the quality of the shoes should be as strong and durable as those previously made for the army. In addition, the workers and cadres at the iron smelting sites have also demonstrated a high degree of communist spirit, adjusting clothes, shoes, socks, and bedding among themselves. Now, each site has assigned special personnel to collect winter clothes and quilts from various workers' families and is starting to send them to the sites in a steady stream, so that workers can concentrate their energy without worries, working hard to produce more iron, produce iron faster, and complete this year's iron production tasks ahead of schedule and above quota.

In Kang County, the masses were mobilized at the three smelting bases to build thatched sheds and bamboo houses in the space around and between the earthen furnaces, basically solving the problem of accommodation for the smelting soldiers to spend the winter.

Workers at the Heitan Temple Xiangziba Iron Plant have all moved into the sheds. Warm as spring, whether sleeping, resting, or smelting, it is like being in a factory with heating.

According to the Shanxi Daily, the Yuci Special Zone has taken measures in many aspects, including political ideology, clothing, food, and housing, to ensure that the steel army spends the winter happily.

The first is to give the steel army sufficient political grain. In terms of life, we must achieve three goods to protect one good, that is, eat well, live well, and rest well, to ensure good production. On the issue of clothing, the whole region has organized more than 20 sewing groups and women's handmade shoe teams to go to the steel front to sew new clothes, mend old ones, and wash clothes for the steel army. Pingyao County has prepared 20,000 cotton-padded coats for the steel army. On the issue of eating, it was decided to establish construction site canteens. Now, construction site canteens have been established in Heshun, Xiyang, Yangquan and other places, and a grain supply system has been implemented, so that the steel army can eat their fill, eat well, and eat hot food. On the issue of housing, the whole region mobilized the masses in villages near the mining areas to contribute 16,310 good houses and 363 good cave dwellings, and newly built 2,271 earthen cave dwellings. Pingyao County built more than 400 semi-cave, semi-house structures, basically solving the housing problem for the steel army.

In addition, the Yuci Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China also proposed to protect the furnaces and machines to safely spend the winter. The safety of furnaces and machines during the winter mainly depends on preparing materials and insulation. In terms of preparing materials, it is required to prepare five months' worth of raw materials in November. Now, more than 400,000 tons of ore, 1.6 million tons of coal, and more than 40,000 tons of coke have been prepared. In terms of insulation, it is required to realize three houses, namely, machine rooms, work rooms, and material rooms. Now, the whole region has built 4,861 machine rooms, work rooms, and material rooms, and also built many earthen cave dwellings. Pingyao County proposed: to clothe the small indigenous blast furnaces, put hats on them, and tie belts around their waists, and add heating to the air inlets. Xiyang County is also preparing to provide heating to the earthen square furnaces.

According to Heilongjiang News, after a heavy snowfall, Chaihe Town in Linkou County was covered in white snow all day, and the temperature was cold. However, the seven indigenous blast furnaces in the town's first "iron smelting workshop" were still producing a steady stream of molten iron.

Can small blast furnaces survive the winter? Some people had many concerns about this question some time ago. They said: It is necessary to change three colds into three heats when smelting iron in the summer. Smelting iron in the winter is possible inside the passes, but in our province, where water turns into ice, it is impossible at all. Some people wanted to take this opportunity to give up. In response to this thought, the commune party committee immediately mobilized the masses and, through vigorous airing of views, big debates, the commune party committee proposed three insulation plans: 1. Put cotton clothes on the indigenous blast furnaces; 2. Move the furnaces into houses; 3. Dig underground shelters. As a result of the debate, everyone agreed that digging underground shelters was good. The commune party committee, based on everyone's opinions, decided to build a large, simple factory building 90 meters long, 8 meters wide, and covering an area of 720 square meters. Based on the principle of self-reliance, taking local materials, and organizing large-scale cooperation, the problem of raw materials was solved. After overall arrangements, more than 800 people were organized in agencies, schools, enterprises, and work areas, and the task was completed in five and a half days. They used 80 cubic meters of old wood to erect a frame on the ground, used wheat straw and wet soil to build a 150 cm high earthen wall, and then dug a 150 cm deep trench below the ground. On top of the frame, they used sorghum stalks tied into long bundles to cover it, smeared it with mud inside and out, and installed doors and windows. In this way, the underground shelter became an iron smelting workshop that was both warm and spacious. In order to meet production needs, while using underground shelters for insulation of the indigenous blast furnaces, the iron smelting personnel also dug underground shelter dormitories and canteens to facilitate follow-up labor.

    把温暖送到钢铁前线去
    甘肃山西黑龙江积极安排钢铁大军过冬
    白雪纷纷飞　铁水映雪红
    地窨保温暖　土炉好过冬
    据甘肃日报消息　甘肃省徽成、康县等地炼铁工地为了做到人人精神振奋，炉炉正常出铁，各工地已采取了一系列措施，加强防寒准备，使工人安全过冬。
    徽成县江洛、水泉、泥阳、黄渚等乡，从9月下旬以来，都先后开展了千套棉衣万双鞋的支援炼铁工地的运动。泥阳乡已经把四十多套棉衣运到工地，水泉乡仅友好人民公社就拿出棉衣、毛衣和单衣、夹衣一百零四件，目前还正突击做鞋，他们提出鞋的质量要像从前给部队的一样结实耐穿。另外，炼铁工地的工人干部也发扬了高度的共产主义精神，互相调剂衣服鞋袜和被褥。现在，各工地还抽出专人从各个工人家庭集中冬衣、棉被，开始源源送上工地，使工人无忧无虑，精力集中，为多出铁、快出铁，提前和超额完成今年铁的生产任务而努力。
    康县在三个冶炼基地发动群众，利用土炉周围和炉炉之间的空间，搭起草棚竹舍，基本解决了冶炼战士们的住宿过冬问题。
    黑潭寺香子坝铁厂工人已全部住进了棚内。温暖如春，无论睡眠休息或冶炼，都如在设有暖气的工厂一样。
    据山西日报消息　榆次专区从政治思想以及衣、食、住等多方面采取措施，以保证钢铁大军愉快地过冬。
    首先是给钢铁大军充足的政治粮食。在生活方面要做到三好保一好，即吃好、住好、休息好，保证生产好。在穿衣问题上，全区已组织了二十多个缝纫组和妇女手工做鞋队，到钢铁前线给钢铁大军缝新补旧，拆洗衣服。平遥县已给钢铁大军准备好了两万件棉大衣。在吃饭问题上，决定建立工地食堂。现在和顺、昔阳、阳泉等地已建立了工地食堂，并实行了粮食供给制，做到了使钢铁大军吃饱、吃好、吃热。在住房问题上，全区动员靠近矿区村庄的群众，献出好房子一万六千三百一十间、好窑洞三百六十三间，新打了土窑洞二千二百七十一间。平遥县因地制宜地搭了半窑半屋的房子四百余间，基本上解决了钢铁大军的住宿问题。
    此外，中共榆次地委还提出了要保护炉子和机器安全过冬。炉子和机器安全过冬主要是做好备料和保温。在备料方面，要求在11月份要准备好五个月的原材料。现在已准备好四十多万吨矿石、一百六十万吨煤、四万多吨焦炭。在保温方面，要求实现三房，即机房、工房、料房。现在全区已搭下机房、工房、料房四千八百六十一座，还打了许多土窑洞。平遥县提出了：要给小土高炉穿衣、戴帽、系腰带，送风口上加暖气。昔阳县准备给土方炉也送暖气。
    据黑龙江消息　经过一场大雪，林口县柴河镇整天白雪纷飞，气温寒冷，镇上第一个“炼铁车间”里的七座土高炉，却依然铁水畅流。
    小高炉能否过冬？前些时候有些人对这个问题存在着很多顾虑，他们说：夏天炼铁还得三冷变三热呢，冬天炼铁关内能行，我们省滴水成冰，根本不成。有人就想趁此丢手不干了。针对这种思想，公社党委即发动群众，通过大鸣大放大辩论，公社党委提出了三种保温方案：一、给土高炉穿棉衣；二、把炉子搬进房子里；三、挖地窨子。辩论的结果，一致认为挖地窨子好。公社党委即根据大家意见，决定修建一座九十公尺长、八公尺宽、面积达七百二十平方公尺的大型简易厂房。本着自力更生、就地取材、组织大协作的原则解决了原材料问题。经过全面安排，在机关、学校、企业和作业区组织了八百多人，突击了五个半天就完成了任务。他们在地平面上用八十立方公尺旧木材竖起房架，用麦秸合湿土，打成一百五十公分高的土墙，再从地平面下挖一百五十公分深的地槽。在房架上面，用秫秸扎成长捆压盖，里外用泥抹好，安上门窗。这样地窨子就成了又保温又宽大的炼铁车间。为了适应生产需要，在土高炉采用地窨子保温的同时，炼铁人员也挖了地窨子宿舍和食堂，便于跟班劳动。（附图片）
