Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, November 17th: A pastoral university has recently been established on the Ordos Banner grassland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Ih Ju League. Among the first group of 51 new students studying here, 50 are children of Mongolian herdsmen. In addition to studying general political and cultural courses, they will focus on studying animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and grassland improvement, as well as other scientific knowledge related to animal husbandry.

The first term of study at the Ordos Banner Pastoral University is tentatively set for one year. The local Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Banner Committee and the Propaganda Minister serve as the president and education director, respectively. All students at the university receive a living allowance. After the establishment of the pastoral university, Mongolian herdsmen excitedly said: Before liberation, this remote grassland not only lacked middle schools, but even primary schools were scarce. Now the Communist Party has helped us establish a university. This is truly a dream come true!

    内蒙古草原上办一所畜牧业大学
    新华社呼和浩特17日电　在内蒙古伊克昭盟的鄂托克旗草原上，最近创办了一所畜牧业大学。在这里学习的第一批五十一名新生中，有五十名是蒙古族牧民的子女。他们除学习一般政治、文化课程外，还着重钻研畜牧兽医和草原改良等有关畜牧的科学知识。
    鄂托克旗畜牧业大学第一期学习时间暂定为一年，由当地中共旗委书记、宣传部长分别担任校长和教育长。全校学生享受着助学金待遇。畜牧业大学成立后，蒙古族牧民兴奋地说：解放前，这个偏僻的草原不仅没有中学校，连小学校也很少，现在共产党帮助我们办起了大学，真是梦想不到的大喜事。
