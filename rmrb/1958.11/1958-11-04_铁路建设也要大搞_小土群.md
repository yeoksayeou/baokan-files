To build railways at high speed to keep up with the needs of national economic development, a large number of steel rails, locomotives, vehicles, and many other materials and equipment are required. Among them, the steel rail problem is very important. Because if there are locomotives and vehicles but no steel rails, then heroes have no place to use their skills. Now, encouraged by the slogan of the whole party and the whole people running transportation, railway construction is progressing rapidly. In many places, the roadbeds have been built and are waiting to be laid with steel rails, but the supply of steel rails cannot keep up. What is the reason? Because steel rails are made of steel, and only large steel rolling mills such as Anshan Iron and Steel can roll them, the quantity is far from meeting the needs. According to the recent plan arranged by the Ministry of Railways, next year China's track laying task will not double, but increase several times, and the number of steel rails required will be even greater. Building large steel rolling mills? The investment is large and the time is long, and distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. What should we do?

The problem is very clear: railway construction also needs to walk on two legs. It is not enough to have only one leg of the "large foreign groups"; we also need the leg of "small indigenous groups" to follow. The recent economic development situation in our country shows that anything that implements walking on two legs is bound to run like flying and develop rapidly. The steel industry has adopted walking on two legs, and a new leap forward has emerged in a short period of time. The national steel production in October increased by 91% compared with September. Doubling steel production this year is already in sight. Therefore, railway construction and other constructions can only accelerate if this policy is implemented.

How should railway construction engage in "small indigenous groups"? In terms of steel rails, after people's efforts, a way has been found. This is to use various cast iron rails, of which ductile iron rails have been proven technically successful through testing and use.

However, some people still do not believe in ductile iron rails. They shake their heads and say, "Is this thing of good quality? What if it derails?" We do not advocate unfounded adventures. We will never act blindly without technical reliability. We require both economy and safety. So, are ductile iron rails okay? We say that practice is the standard for testing truth, and whether it is okay depends on the results of testing and use. The ductile iron rails created by Tsinghua University and laid on the railway special line of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have been in use for nearly three months, with more than 15,000 train passages and a cargo volume of more than 10 million tons, exceeding the annual freight volume of an ordinary railway. This proves that ductile iron rails are basically successful. It can be said with certainty that this type of rail can not only be used as light rail, but also can be used to replace some heavy rails, and can be used on railway branch lines, dedicated lines, and marshalling station tracks. This solves a big problem. We can transfer the heavy rails in these places to the main lines for use, greatly accelerating railway construction.

Some people say that the lifespan of ductile iron rails is shorter than that of steel rails. From the current technical conditions, this is a fact. But steel rails are in short supply and cannot meet the needs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. The problem currently facing us is whether to wait for steel rails and postpone railway construction, thereby affecting national economic development, or to advocate walking on two legs, striving for railway precedence, to promote the development of the entire national economy? The latter should definitely be chosen. Therefore, the shorter lifespan of iron rails is not the primary concern. More importantly, it buys time for construction. Even if these iron rails are damaged after a few years, we have already solved the problem, and we can replace them with steel rails if necessary, and the old iron rails can be recovered for steelmaking. This is equally worthwhile.

Therefore, any attitude of doubt and indifference towards ductile iron rails is wrong. The correct attitude should be to welcome it, support it, and actively promote its development. At the same time, we must also widely carry out experimental research work. The most important thing here is to further liberate our minds. Only by liberating our minds and boldly raising questions can we conduct in-depth research and find out the internal laws of things. Whether it is the basically successful ductile iron rail or the cast steel rail, pig iron rail, or high-sulfur malleable cast iron rail that is being tested, they all have great prospects. Now the cross-sectional shape of our steel rails is that the rail head is thicker, and the rail web and rail base are thinner. This is designed based on the characteristics of steel rail materials, rolling technology, and load-bearing capacity, and is not suitable for cast rails. Can we research a rail cross-sectional shape that is suitable for the mechanical properties and casting properties of ductile iron? Can we find an economical and mass-supplied spheroidizing agent to replace expensive metallic magnesium as a spheroidizing agent? Can we ensure that the local iron with higher phosphorus and sulfur content produced everywhere can be used to manufacture iron rails that meet quality requirements? All of these have a lot to offer, and heroes can emerge from them.

With the advent of ductile iron rails, railway construction can be greatly accelerated. But it also raises new problems for us, that is, locomotives and vehicles must also catch up quickly. We believe that as long as everyone uses their brains and finds solutions, fruitful results will definitely be achieved in the "small indigenous groups" aspect of railways.

### 铁路建设也要大搞“小土群”

    铁路建设也要大搞“小土群”
    要高速度地建设铁路，以赶上国民经济发展的需要，就需要大量的钢轨、机车车辆和其他许多材料设备。其中钢轨问题很重要。因为如果有了机车车辆而无钢轨，那么英雄也无用武之地。现在，在全党全民办交通的口号鼓舞下，铁路施工进展很快，许多地方的路基都筑起来了，就等着铺钢轨了，但是钢轨就是供应不上。原因何在呢？因为钢轨都是用钢轧制的，而且只有鞍钢等大型轧钢厂才能轧制，数量远远不能满足需要。按照铁道部最近安排的计划，明年我国铁路的铺轨任务，不是翻一番，而是翻几番，需要的钢轨数量更为巨大。建设大型轧钢厂吗？投资既多，时间又久，远水解不了近渴。怎么办呢？
    问题摆得很清楚，建设铁路也需要两条腿走路。光有“大洋群”一条腿还不够，还需要“小土群”这条腿跟上去。我们国家最近经济发展的形势表明，凡是贯彻两条腿走路的，必然是跑步如飞，发展迅速。钢铁工业采取两条腿走路，短时间内就出现了新的大跃进的局面。10月份全国钢的产量比9月份猛增了91％。今年钢产加番，已是胜利在望了。因此，铁路建设和其他各项建设，也只有贯彻这个方针，才能加快速度。
    铁路建设怎么搞“小土群”呢？在钢轨方面，经过人们的努力，现在已经摸到一条道路了，这就是采用各种铸造铁轨，其中球墨铸铁铁轨，经过试验和使用，证明在技术上是成功的。
    但是现在有些人对球墨铸铁铁轨还不大相信。他们摇摇头说：“这玩意儿质量行吗？如果翻了车怎么办？”我们并不提倡毫无根据的冒险。没有技术上的可靠保证，我们绝不去蛮干。我们既要求经济，又要求安全。那么，球墨铸铁铁轨行不行呢？我们说，实践是检验真理的标准，行不行要看试验和使用结果如何而定。清华大学创造的球墨铸铁铁轨铺设在石景山钢铁厂铁路专用线上，已经使用了将近三个月，通车一万五千多次，通过的货物量达一千多万吨，超过一条普通铁路一年的货运量。这就证明球墨铸铁铁轨基本上是成功的，可以肯定地说，这种铁轨不仅完全可以用做轻轨，而且可以用来代替部分重轨，使用在铁路支线、专用线和编组站站线上。这就解决很大的问题。我们可以把这些地方的重轨调到主要干线上使用，大大加快铁路的建设。
    有些人说，球墨铸铁铁轨的寿命比钢轨短，从现在的技术条件看，这是事实。但钢轨就是数量少，远远不能满足工农业大跃进的需要。目前摆在我们面前的问题是坐等钢轨，推迟铁路的建设，以至影响国民经济的发展呢？还是提倡用两条腿走路，力争铁路先行，以促进整个国民经济的发展呢？肯定的应该选择后者。因此，铁轨寿命短一些还不是首要的，更重要的是为建设争取了时间。几年以后，即使这些铁轨坏了，但是我们已经解决了问题，必要时还可以再换上钢轨，而旧铁轨还可以收回炼钢。这同样是划得来的。
    因此，任何对球墨铸铁铁轨采取怀疑和冷淡的态度都是错误的。正确的态度应该是欢迎它，扶持它，并积极地促进它的发展。同时，还要广泛地开展试验研究工作。这里面最重要的是进一步解放思想。只有解放思想，大胆的提出问题，才能进行深入的研究，找出事物的内在规律。不论是已经基本成功的球墨铸铁铁轨或正在试验中的铸钢钢轨、生铁铁轨或高硫可锻铸铁铁轨，都是有很大前途的。现在我们钢轨的断面形状是轨头较粗，轨腰和轨底较薄，这是根据钢轨的材料、轧制工艺、承受力量等特点设计的，不适合于铸造的路轨。是否可以研究出适用于球墨铸铁的机械性能和铸造性能的铁轨断面形状呢？能不能找出既经济而又能大量供应的球化剂来代替贵重的金属镁作球化剂呢？能不能够做到各地生产的磷硫成份较高的土铁，都可以用来制造满足质量要求的铁轨呢？所有这些都大有文章可做，都可以出英雄。
    球墨铸铁铁轨出来以后，铁路的建设可以大大加快了。但是又给我们提出了新的问题，这就是机车车辆也要迅速地赶上来。我们相信，只要大家动脑筋，想办法，在铁路的“小土群”方面，一定能结出丰硕的果实来。
