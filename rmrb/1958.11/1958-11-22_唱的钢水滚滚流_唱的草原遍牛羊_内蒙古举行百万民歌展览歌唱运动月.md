    唱的钢水滚滚流　唱的草原遍牛羊
    内蒙古举行百万民歌展览歌唱运动月
    新华社呼和浩特20日电　内蒙古自治区从16日开始举行“千人唱，万人和”的百万民歌展览歌唱运动月。一向有“诗歌海洋”之称的内蒙古，这几天，人们豪情诗意更加漾溢。北起大兴安岭，南到鄂尔多斯草原，到处飘荡着歌颂今年大跃进的欢乐歌声。正是“人人都把山歌唱，山歌唱出万担粮，唱的钢水滚滚流，唱的草原遍牛羊”。
    运动月中举办的民歌展览会，展出了从三百多万首各族民歌中挑选出来的一百四十多万首民歌。展览会的解说工作，由内蒙古一级表演艺术团体的演员，采用合唱、独唱、朗诵、好力宝、快板和相声等艺术表现形式进行。在运动月中，自治区还要举办歌唱演出大会、全区赛诗广播大会和青年歌咏赛诗大会等。这个运动将逐渐从自治区首府呼和浩特市，向各盟、旗、县、市和乡、社、村、户深入发展。在运动月期间，自治区各文化、艺术、新闻等部门也都加强有关民歌的搜集、整理、报道和演唱等活动。
    中国文学艺术界联合会和中国民间文艺研究会，已向这个百万民歌展览歌唱运动月致电祝贺。中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记乌兰夫（蒙古族）书记杨植霖、王铎和内蒙古自治区副主席王再天（蒙古族）等领导人员，都参观了民歌展览会，并写了题词。
