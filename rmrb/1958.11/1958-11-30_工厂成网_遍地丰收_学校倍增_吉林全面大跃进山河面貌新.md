    Jilin's Comprehensive Great Leap Forward Brings a New Look to the Land
    (By Our Correspondent) Jilin Province, nestled against the Changbai Mountains in the east and the Songliao Plain in the west, has taken on a completely new look in this year of the Great Leap Forward.
    From January to October this year, the province's industrial output value increased by 56.4% compared to the same period last year, with the average output value in thirty-four days equaling the entire year's output in 1949. Since the upsurge of the mass movement to run industry in May this year, the province has built more than 120,000 large and small factories and mines, with an average of 680 factories and mines being built and put into production every day. The industrial network is spreading throughout the province, with Changchun City and Gongzhuling City in the central part of the Songliao Plain, Jilin City on the Songhua River, Tonghua City at the foot of the Changbai Mountains, Baicheng City on the vast grassland, and Yanji City, the capital of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, all developing towards modern industrial cities. This year, Jilin Province ended its history of not producing steel, cement, or machine tools. In the days of the Great Leap Forward, more than 70,000 iron-smelting furnaces have been built, and several medium and small-sized iron and steel joint enterprises are under intense construction; a total of 912 cement plants have been built; and 58 machine repair plants have been transformed into machine manufacturing plants. As of October, the province had trial-produced more than 3,390 new products, of which 228 have reached or exceeded international standards.
    During the First Five-Year Plan, the automobile, chemical, electric power, paper, and forestry industries established and developed in Jilin Province have fully played a huge role in supporting the whole country. In addition to supplying a large number of Jiefang brand trucks to various places, Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has also manufactured Hongqi brand high-end sedans, Dongfeng brand small sedans, three-axle drive high-off-road performance trucks, dump trucks, and coal trucks in the past six months. At present, a mass movement is being carried out to rapidly leap from a production capacity of 70,000 vehicles per year to a target of 150,000 vehicles per year. Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, located on the banks of the Songhua River, is producing large quantities of chemical fertilizers, dyes, and calcium carbide, and is vigorously developing organic synthetic chemical industry based on coal and calcium carbide. The development of the electric power industry in Jilin Province is also very rapid. In addition to the Fengman Hydropower Station supplying inexpensive power to various parts of Northeast China, the Longwangmiao Hydropower Station, which will be more than twice as powerful as the smaller Fengman station, is about to be built on the upper reaches of the Second Songhua River. Jilin Province's paper industry, which ranks first in the country in terms of output, has an average output every twelve days equal to the average annual output during the Puppet Manchukuo period. The forestry industry in the Changbai Mountain area is moving towards mechanization. In the first half of this year, the proportion of comprehensive mechanization increased by 44% compared to the same period last year, and the proportion of mechanized timber harvesting increased by one time.
    Jilin Province's grain output this year (including soybeans) increased by 40% compared to last year, with an average of 1,100 catties of grain per person. Twelve cities and counties in the province have achieved the grain production targets set in the National Agricultural Development Program. The alpine Changbai Mountain area and the saline-alkali land in the western grassland have all become places rich in grain production. The mountain products and wild products of the Changbai Mountain area, such as the famous "Three Treasures" - ginseng, mink fur, and deer antlers, have also successively launched high-yield "satellites" this year; the ginseng gardens, deer farms, orchards, and bee farms in the mountain valleys are also expanding rapidly.
    The rural areas of the province have realized the people's commune system. The rural areas are moving towards mechanization and electrification. Up to now, 117 small hydropower stations have been built in the rural areas of the province.
    In the upsurge of cultural revolution and technical revolution, the development of culture and education in Jilin Province has been unprecedented. By the end of June this year, the province had basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people; in August, all school-age children were enrolled, and primary and secondary education below junior high school was universalized. The number of universities and colleges in the province has increased from seven in 1957 to 133, and the number of college students has increased by two times; the number of secondary schools has increased from 267 to 3,588, and the number of students has increased by 1.6 times; the number of primary schools has increased from 6,854 to 18,177, and the number of students has nearly doubled. Factories, rural areas, government agencies, and organizations have established 2,462 Red and Expert schools, and nurseries and kindergartens are all over the villages, and hospitals, maternity hospitals, and libraries are available in every township. There are 20,000 spare time schools. Jilin Province has put forward the grand goal of universalizing higher education within ten years. Scientific research has also developed rapidly due to the mass movement, and a mass scientific network has been built throughout the province, with a total of 3,624 scientific research institutions and a thirteen-fold increase in scientific researchers compared to last year. The Jilin Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has sixteen research institutes, was officially established in August this year.

    工厂成网　遍地丰收　学校倍增
    吉林全面大跃进山河面貌新
    本报讯　东依长白山，西卧松辽平原的吉林省，在大跃进的一年里，面貌焕然一新。
    全省今年1至10月份的工业产值比去年同期增长56.4％，平均三十四天的产值就等于1949年全年的产值。从今年5月掀起全民办工业的高潮以来，全省已建成十二万多座大、小厂矿，平均每天有六百八十座厂矿建成并投入生产。工业网散布全省，处于松辽平原中部的长春市和公主岭市，松花江边的吉林市，长白山麓的通化市，茫茫草原上的白城市，以及延边朝鲜族自治州的首府延吉市，都在向着近代化工业城市发展。吉林省今年结束了不出钢铁、不出水泥、不能制造机床的历史。在大跃进的日子里，已建成七万多座炼铁炉，还有数座中、小型钢铁联合企业正在紧张施工；水泥厂共建成九百一十二座；有五十八座机器修配厂转为机器制造厂。截至10月份为止，全省已试制出三千三百九十余种新产品，其中有二百二十八种达到和超过国际水平。
    第一个五年计划期间，在吉林省建立和发展起来的汽车、化学、电力、造纸和森林工业，都充分发挥了支援全国的巨大作用。长春第一汽车制造厂除供应各地大批解放牌载重汽车外，近半年来又制成了红旗牌高级轿车、东风牌小轿车、三轴传动高越野性能载重汽车、翻斗车和煤汽车。目前正大搞群众运动，由年产七万辆的生产能力向年产十五万辆的目标，飞速跃进。位于松花江畔的吉林化学工业公司，正在大量生产化学肥料、染料和电石，并以煤炭和电石为基础大力发展有机合成化学工业。吉林省电力工业的发展也很迅速，除丰满水电站以廉价电力源源供给东北各地外，在第二松花江上游即将建设功率比小丰满大一倍多的龙王庙水电站。产量居全国首位的吉林省造纸工业，今年平均每十二天的产量就等于伪满时期平均一年的产量。长白山区的森林工业，正在向机械化方向迈进，今年上半年综合机械化比重比去年同期提高44％，机械化集材比重提高一倍。
    吉林省今年的粮食产量（包括大豆）比去年增长40％，平均每人有粮一千一百斤。全省已有十二个市、县实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食生产指标。位于高寒地带的长白山区和西部草原的盐碱土地，都跃为盛产粮食的地方。长白山区的山货野物，如著名的“三宝”——人参、貂皮、鹿茸，今年也先后放出高产“卫星”；山间谷地的参园、鹿场、果园、蜂场，也都在迅速扩大。
    全省农村已实现人民公社化。农村正在向着机械化和电气化方向迈进。到目前为止，全省农村已建成小型水电站一百一十七处。
    在文化革命和技术革命的高潮中，吉林省文化教育事业的发展为历年所未有。今年6月末，全省基本扫除青壮年文盲；8月份适龄儿童全部入学，并普及了初中以下的学校教育。全省高等学校由1957年的七所增至一百三十三所，大学生增加了两倍；中等学校由二百六十七所增至三千五百八十八所，学生增加了一点六倍；小学由六千八百五十四所增至一万八千一百七十七所，学生增加近一倍。工厂、农村、机关、团体办起红专学校二千四百六十二所，托儿所、幼儿园、遍布各村，医院、产院、图书馆、乡乡皆有。业余学校达两万所。吉林省已经提出了在十年内普及高等教育的宏伟目标。科学研究事业也由于大搞群众运动而飞跃发展，全省已建成群众性的科学网，共有科学研究机构三千六百二十四所，科学研究人员比去年增加十三倍。拥有十六个研究所的中国科学院吉林省分院已在今年8月间正式成立。
