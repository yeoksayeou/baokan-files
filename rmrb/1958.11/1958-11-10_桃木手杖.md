    Peach Wood Cane
    Nikolai Tikhonov

    Mao Yeqing, an old man from Shaoshan Village, the hometown of Comrade Mao Zedong, gave me a light peach wood cane. When Old Man Mao Yeqing was working underground, he carried this cane and traveled all over Hunan Province for twenty-five years. Light old peach wood cane, you always stand before my eyes. How good you are at walking silently, covered with the tempering of wind and sun. How many roads are asking: Who are you? Jungles disappear in groups behind you, twenty-five years of underground work, brother, closely linked with you. It was an old man from Shaoshan Village who held you and traveled thousands of miles. Like you, he can tell many stories, stories that are hard to find in books. As if it just happened yesterday, signal fires blazed in the night, letting the sound of cannons dispel the long night, and letting bullets destroy the shackles of poverty. One end of you is bent, broken by stones on the winding path. You, walking non-stop like this, are not visiting the heroes who rest after the war... People listen to the sound of your tapping, as if listening to a heart beating. You say: "I keep knocking, I keep walking, so that people will remember my words. I transmit orders to the Communist Party members, I summon all people to fight for freedom, I am not afraid of any enemy, and I have never been tripped by weeds. Regardless of the sun and rain above my head, I move forward forever day and night. Above my head is the lovely sky of my hometown, and I serve the people wholeheartedly. If my master has a fever and falls ill, I will accompany another messenger, I will re-knock on the winding path, and continue my endless journey. People who see me will think like this: Messenger, we believe this password! It is the loyal envoy sent by the Party, and we trust it completely faithfully and reliably. I am haggard, like peasant brothers, I am sharp, like the land crying, and my cane head is burning hot like the rolling tears of the people of Hunan. Years flow by like a river, and I stand in a quiet corner of the room. I was once a loyal messenger of the Party, but that was many years ago.” I gently stroke the peach wood cane, and each tree knot seems kind and lovely. No matter which side I look at it from carefully, they all burn with magical brilliance. They seem to want to tell someone's story, or talk about the victory of the people of Hunan. Twenty-five years of underground work shine like a myth before my eyes.

    桃木手杖
    尼·吉洪诺夫
    毛泽东同志故乡韶山村的毛叶青老人，送给我一根轻轻的桃木手杖。毛叶青老人当年在地下工作时，拿着这只手杖，二十五年中，走遍了湖南全省。轻便的老桃木手杖啊，你一直立在我的眼前。你多么善于无声地行走啊满身是风吹日晒的磨炼。多少条道路都在问：你是谁？丛林在你身后成群地消逝，二十五年的地下工作兄弟啊，跟你紧连在一起。拿着你走遍千里长途的是韶山村的一位老人，他和你一样能叙述许多事迹，这些事迹在书本里难寻。就像昨天刚发生过一样，黑夜里燃起了信号的烈火，让炮声驱散漫长的黑夜，让枪弹摧毁贫困的枷锁。你的一端弯了起来，是被羊肠小道上的石子打烂，你呀，这样不停地走路，并不是到战后休息的英雄处作客……人们倾听你敲击的声音，就像倾听一个心灵在跳动。你说：“我不住地敲，不住地走，为的是使人们把我的话牢记心中。我给共产党员传送着命令，我召唤所有的人为自由斗争，我不怕任何敌人，从没有被乱草绊住脚跟。不管头上的日晒雨淋，不管白天黑夜我永远前进，在我头上是家乡可爱的天空，我一心一意服务于人民。如果我的主人发烧病倒，我就伴随着另一个送信人，我重新敲打着羊肠小道，继续我无尽的行程。人们看到我就会这样思忖，送信人，我们相信这个暗号！它就是党派来的忠实使者，我们完全信任它忠实可靠。我憔悴了，就像农民兄弟，我尖利了，像土地在哭泣，我的杖头磨得发烫像湖南人民的滚滚热泪。岁月像河水般流去，我站在了一个寂静的屋角里，我曾经是党的忠实信使可这已经是许多年以前的事。”我亲切地抚摸着桃木手杖，个个树结全显得可亲可爱，无论从哪一面仔细端详，它们都燃烧着神奇的光彩。它们好像要讲述谁的故事，或者谈谈湖南人民的胜利，地下工作的二十五年，像神话般闪耀在我的眼前。
