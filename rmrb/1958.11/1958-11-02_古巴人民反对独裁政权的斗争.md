    The Cuban People's Struggle Against the Dictatorial Regime
    Zhang Ye
    New Storm
    Cuba is currently in the midst of a new storm. Faced with the constantly expanding and intensifying anti-dictatorial struggle of the Cuban people, the Batista reactionaries are stubbornly trying to impose the sham of a general election on the Cuban people. Batista's attempt to hold elections is a conspiracy to prop up Andres Rivero Aguero, his henchman and a lackey of US imperialism, as the candidate of the ruling party, while he himself retreats behind the scenes to continue issuing orders. The Cuban people resolutely oppose Batista's election fraud, and the flames of anger against the dictatorship and the election fraud have spread throughout Cuba.
    The forces opposing Batista include the "July 26th Movement" led by Castro and the insurgent forces; former Cuban President Prio Socarras, now in exile in Miami, Florida, in the United States; and the democratic forces led by the Cuban Popular Socialist Party.
    Castro, along with his eighty-one comrades, landed in the Playa Colorada area of Oriente Province in eastern Cuba on December 2, 1956, twenty-three months ago, aboard the yacht "Granma" from Mexico. They established the headquarters of the insurgent forces and a guerrilla base in the Sierra Maestra mountains, launching a guerrilla war. Castro's insurgent movement initially had a military adventurist character, but later their combat objectives and action program gradually became clear. They announced that their combat objective was first to end the Cuban dictatorial system, laying the foundation for the establishment of a truly representative government; their proposed action program was: to demand the release of all political prisoners, to achieve freedom of the press, to restore the political rights of all citizens, to implement land reform, to improve the people's living standards, to eliminate unemployment, to eliminate illiteracy, and to industrialize the country. The actions of the insurgent forces have increasingly gained the support of people from all walks of life in Cuba, making this movement increasingly democratic and nationalistic in nature. Now, the insurgent forces in the Sierra Maestra alone have expanded to more than five thousand people. Guerrilla activities are taking place in all six provinces of Cuba. The insurgent forces control large areas of the three provinces of Oriente, Las Villas, and Matanzas, and effectively control the situation there.
    The group led by Prio Socarras, exiled in Miami, is actually a loyal lackey of US imperialism and a reserve puppet of the United States. Socarras was elected president in June 1948 with the support of the United States. Because his policy of betraying national interests aroused strong opposition from the people, US imperialism instigated a policy to support Batista's rise to power. Now, Batista's situation is more difficult than Socarras's situation was in those days. So US imperialism has thought of Socarras again. Initially, Socarras attempted to use the armed uprising movement to raise funds and supply arms for Castro. But when Castro's insurgent movement became increasingly democratic and nationalistic in nature, Socarras refused to support Castro and even prevented weapons from being transported to the insurgent forces. Castro also publicly broke with the pro-American Socarras, making his struggle against Batista and against American support for Batista even more resolute.
    The Cuban Popular Socialist Party is the vanguard of the Cuban people's anti-dictatorial struggle. For many years, the Popular Socialist Party has waged a resolute struggle against the Batista dictatorship in the harsh environment of white terror, using the mobilization of the masses as a weapon. The Popular Socialist Party does not approve of Castro's terrorist actions in urban and rural areas, such as bombing, burning sugarcane plantations, and attacking trains, believing that such "actions that are divorced from the people, isolated terrorism, and assassinations... are not a sufficient way to mobilize the entire people." However, the Popular Socialist Party still supports Castro's insurgent movement. It has stated that it not only sympathizes with the armed struggle of the insurgent forces, but also actively supports every guerrilla zone, helping to strengthen the connection between guerrilla operations and mass struggles.
    The Shameless Interference of the United States
    In the storm of the people's anti-dictatorial struggle, the reason why Batista can still eke out his regime is mainly due to the full support and shameless interference of US imperialism. The United States, according to the "Continental Defense Military Treaty" signed with Cuba, constantly supplies Batista with ammunition and weapons to slaughter the Cuban people. The two US naval bases in Cuba, Caimanera and Guantanamo, have played a role in directly supporting Batista's troops. The United States also transports weapons to Batista through Trujillo, the dictator of the Dominican Republic. The US military delegation in Cuba, in addition to helping train the Cuban army, directly commands the Cuban government army to fight against the Cuban insurgent forces.
    Not only that, but the US government also announced in August of this year that it would send Marines to land in Cuba to guard the Guantanamo aqueduct for Batista in order to carry out direct armed intervention. This aggressive attempt by the United States was strongly opposed by the Cuban people and world public opinion, and it was forced to withdraw its landing troops. However, in less than three months, the inherently aggressive US imperialism, under the pretext of "protecting American property and American citizens," issued a statement threatening to "take measures" to deal with the insurgent forces, and, under the pretext of evacuating expatriates, sent a fast attack transport ship to Nicaro on the northeast coast of Cuba.
    In addition, the US State Department signed a secret agreement with Batista at the end of January this year, promising to take action to prevent the insurgent forces from raising funds and purchasing arms in the United States. According to this agreement, the US government arrested Castro's representative in New York, Angel Perez, in August. As for Cuban citizens who raise funds and transport arms for the insurgent forces in the United States, they are often subjected to unreasonable interference and arrest by the US government.
    Unity is the Key to Victory
    Another very important factor in Batista's ability to maintain his precarious situation is that the various forces of the Cuban people opposing the Batista dictatorship have not united.
    The armed uprising movement led by Castro has received the support of the Cuban people from a wide range of strata and patriotic democratic parties. In mid-October 1957, the "July 26th Movement" led by Castro, the Cuban University Students Federation, the Cuban People's Party, the Cuban Revolutionary Party, and overseas compatriots' organizations jointly established the "Cuban Liberation Committee." In April of this year, when Castro launched the anti-Batista "total war," he gained the support of forty-two groups representing important forces in the country, and the Cuban Popular Socialist Party also issued a statement of support. However, Castro's unity with other bourgeois and petty-bourgeois opposition parties is loose. Due to the US sowing discord, disputes often occur between them. And these forces opposing Batista, including Castro, are afraid to varying degrees of the rise of the people's movement, and intentionally exclude the Popular Socialist Party from participating in many joint actions related to opposing Batista.
    The Cuban Popular Socialist Party has persevered in its struggle to establish a democratic national united front. In August of this year, Juan Marinello, chairman of the Popular Socialist Party, and Blas Roca, general secretary, pointed out in an open letter to Castro and other opposition parties that the only way to liberate Cuba from the current despotic rule of the Batista government is for all opposition parties to unite and establish a consultative committee composed of representatives from various opposition parties, as well as student, labor, industrial, commercial, civic organizations, patriotic groups, and Catholic organizations.
    Due to the experience of nearly two years of cruel struggle, the demand for unity has begun to emerge among the various forces opposing Batista. Not long ago, some Cuban parties opposing the dictatorial government signed a unity agreement in Caracas (the capital of Venezuela). This agreement declares the unconditional unity of all Cubans opposing Batista's tyranny.
    The outlook for the situation in Cuba is bright. As long as all forces in Cuba opposing Batista can unite closely and form a united front to carry out a resolute struggle, then the American-backed dictatorship can be overthrown.

    古巴人民反对独裁政权的斗争
    章叶
    新的风暴
    目前的古巴正处在新的风暴中。面对着古巴人民不断扩大和加强的反独裁斗争，巴蒂斯塔反动集团执意要把大选的骗局强加在古巴人民身上。巴蒂斯塔搞大选的企图是阴谋把他豢养的奴仆、美帝国主义的走狗安德雷斯·里韦罗·阿古阿罗作为执政党的候选人扶上台，而让自己退到幕后继续发号施令。古巴人民坚决反对巴蒂斯塔的选举骗局，反对独裁政权和选举骗局的怒火已燃遍了整个古巴。
    反对巴蒂斯塔的力量，有卡斯特罗领导的“7月26日运动”派和起义部队；古巴前总统、现在流亡在美国佛罗里达州迈阿密城的普里奥·苏加拉斯和以古巴社会主义人民党为首的民主力量。
    卡斯特罗是在二十三个月以前，1956年12月2日带领他的八十一个战友，从墨西哥乘“格拉玛”号游艇在古巴东部奥连特省的布拉牙·奥罗拉地方登陆的。他们在马埃斯特腊山区建立了起义部队的总部和游击根据地，展开了游击战争。卡斯特罗领导的起义运动，起初具有军事冒险性质，后来他们的战斗目的和行动纲领逐渐明确。他们宣布他们的战斗目的首先是结束古巴独裁制度，为建立一个真正的具有代表性的政府打下基础；他们提出的行动纲领是：要求释放一切政治犯，实现出版自由，恢复全体公民的政治权利，实行土地改革，提高人民生活水平，消除失业现象，扫除文盲和使国家工业化。起义部队的行动越来越得到古巴各阶层人民的支持，使这个运动日益具有民主主义和民族主义的性质。现在，单是马埃斯特腊山区的起义部队已经扩大到五千人以上。古巴全国六个省都有了游击队的活动。起义部队控制了奥连特、拉斯维利亚斯和马坦萨斯等三个省的广大地区，并且实际上控制了那里的局势。
    流亡在迈阿密的以普里奥·苏加拉斯为首的一群人，实际上是美帝国主义的忠实走狗，是美国的后备傀儡。苏加拉斯是1948年6月受美国支持当选总统的。由于他出卖民族利益的政策引起了人民的强烈反对，美帝国主义便策动政策，扶植巴蒂斯塔上台。现在，巴蒂斯塔的处境比当年苏加拉斯的处境更为困难。于是美帝国主义又想起苏加拉斯来了。最初，苏加拉斯曾企图利用武装起义运动，为卡斯特罗筹款和供应军火。但当卡斯特罗的起义运动日益具有民主主义和民族主义运动的性质的时候，苏加拉斯就拒绝支持卡斯特罗，甚至阻止把武器运送给起义部队。卡斯特罗也公开同亲美的苏加拉斯决裂，使他的反对巴蒂斯塔和反对美国支持巴蒂斯塔的斗争更加坚决起来。
    古巴社会主义人民党是古巴人民反独裁斗争的先锋队。多年以来，社会主义人民党在白色恐怖的艰苦环境中，以发动群众作为武器对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权进行坚决的斗争。社会主义人民党不赞成卡斯特罗在城乡中进行的投炸弹、烧甘蔗种植园、袭击列车等恐怖行动，认为这种“脱离人民的行动、孤立的恐怖主义和暗杀行为……并不是足以动员全民的办法”。但是，社会主义人民党对卡斯特罗的起义运动仍然加以支持，它曾经声明，不仅同情起义部队的武装斗争，而且积极支援每一个游击区，帮助加强游击队的行动和群众斗争之间的联系。
    美国的无耻干涉
    在人民反独裁斗争的风暴中，巴蒂斯塔所以还能苟延残喘地维持他的政权，主要是由于美帝国主义的全力支持和无耻干涉。美国根据同古巴签订的“大陆防御军事条约”，不断地把弹药和武器供给巴蒂斯塔屠杀古巴人民。美国在古巴的卡伊马内拉和关塔那摩两个海军基地则起了直接支援巴蒂斯塔的部队的作用。美国还通过多米尼加共和国的独裁者特鲁希略把武器运给巴蒂斯塔。美国驻古巴的军事代表团除了帮助训练古巴军队外，并直接指挥古巴政府军对古巴起义部队作战。
    不仅如此，美国政府还在今年8月间宣布要派遣海军陆战队在古巴登陆，替巴蒂斯塔看守关塔那摩输水道，以便进行直接的武装干涉。美国这一侵略图谋，遭到古巴人民和全世界舆论的强烈反对，被迫撤回它的登陆部队。但是，不到三个月，侵略成性的美帝国主义又借口“保护美国财产和美国公民”而发表一项声明，威胁要“采取措施”来对付起义部队，并在撤退侨民的借口下，派了一艘快速进攻运输舰前往古巴东北海岸的尼卡罗。
    此外，美国国务院还在今年1月底同巴蒂斯塔签订一项秘密协定，答应采取行动阻止起义部队在美国筹集款项和购买军火。根据这个协定，美国政府在8月间逮捕了卡斯特罗驻纽约的代表安吉尔·佩雷兹。至于在美国为起义部队筹集款项和运送军火的古巴公民更是经常遭到美国政府的无理干涉和逮捕。
    团结是胜利的关键
    巴蒂斯塔之所以能够维持他的残局，还有一个很重要的因素，就是古巴人民反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的各种力量还没有团结起来。
    卡斯特罗领导的武装起义运动，获得古巴广泛阶层的人民和爱国民主党派的支持。1957年10月中旬，卡斯特罗领导的“7月26日运动”派、古巴大学生联合会、古巴人民党、古巴革命党和国外侨胞团体联合成立了“古巴解放委员会”。今年4月，卡斯特罗发动反巴蒂斯塔“总体战”时，曾获得了代表国内各方面重要力量的四十二个团体的支持，古巴社会主义人民党也发表声明支持。但是，卡斯特罗同其他资产阶级和小资产阶级的反对派的团结是松弛的。由于美国的挑拨离间，他们之间还时常发生纠纷。而这些反对巴蒂斯塔的力量，包括卡斯特罗在内，又在不同程度上害怕人民运动的高涨，在许多有关反对巴蒂斯塔的联合行动中，有意排斥社会主义人民党参加。
    古巴社会主义人民党坚持不懈地为建立民主民族统一战线而奋斗。今年8月间，社会主义人民党的主席胡安·马里内略和总书记布拉斯·罗加在写给卡斯特罗和其他反对派的一封公开信中指出，把古巴从巴蒂斯塔政府目前的专制统治之下解放出来的唯一办法是所有反对派联合起来，成立一个由各反对派及学生、劳工、工业、商业、市民组织、爱国团体和天主教组织的代表共同组成的协商委员会。
    由于将近两年的残酷斗争的经验，在反对巴蒂斯塔的各种力量中开始有了团结的要求。不久以前，古巴一些反对独裁政府的党派在加拉加斯（委内瑞拉首都）签订了一项团结协定。这个协定宣布要毫无例外地团结一切反对巴蒂斯塔暴政的古巴人。
    古巴局势的前景是光明的。只要古巴所有反对巴蒂斯塔的力量都能紧密地团结起来，组成统一战线，坚决进行斗争，那末，美国支持的独裁统治是可以被推翻的。
