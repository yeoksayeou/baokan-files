Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 1st: Copenhagen Dispatch: The 20th Congress of the Danish Communist Party opened on October 31st.

    The congress passed a resolution to expel Central Committee member Moltke from the party by a vote of 142 to 31.

    In the morning session, Thomsen, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party, delivered the work report of the Central Committee.

    In his report, Thomsen criticized and refuted the revisionist tendencies within the party leadership, especially the performance of the former party chairman Larsen, and emphasized the solidarity and unity of the Danish Communist Party with the communist parties and workers' parties of all countries.

    Referring to the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the report pointed out that the authors of the draft program of the LCY are modern revisionists. They attempt to revise the basic principles of the revolutionary movement on a series of important issues and deceive the workers. The Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party refuted and condemned the various revisionist arguments in the draft program of the LCY.

    The Central Committee's work report pointed out that the erroneous remarks of the former party chairman Larsen have nothing in common with socialism. It opened the door wide for revisionist theories and tendencies. The Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party opposed these arguments and once again emphasized its firm support for the solidarity and unity of the international workers' movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. The Central Committee once again declared its complete agreement with the Moscow Declaration of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties.

    The main focus of the report on the party's political work was on upholding the principle of democratic centralism. Thomsen pointed out that revisionists are attacking the principle of democratic centralism and demanding freedom to organize factions within the party.

    He continued, we must safeguard our Danish Communist Party, making it a loyal member of the international proletarian family. We must carry out organizational, political, and personnel reforms and adjustments to ensure that the party continues to advance and that it continues to receive the support of the working class and all working people.

    In the afternoon session, a discussion of Thomsen's report was launched, with nine people speaking at the meeting.

    The head of the Soviet delegation, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Pospelov, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress. He said that the Danish Communist Party has entered its fortieth year of existence. During this period, it has gone through a long and arduous road of struggle, safeguarding the interests of the Danish working people, and safeguarding their social and democratic rights.

    Pospelov said that in the year since the Moscow meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties, the communist and workers' parties have been further consolidated, and their ranks have been strengthened ideologically and politically. This situation has aroused new conspiracies on the part of the imperialist reactionaries, who are attempting to undermine the solidarity of the international communist movement and destroy the communist party and other democratic movements by any means possible. He continued, it must not be forgotten that in addition to adopting political means to persecute democratic forces, the reactionary bourgeoisie also adopts methods of ideological struggle, and is now placing its main bet on revisionism, in order to undermine the communist party and workers' parties from within. Revisionism is the ideological weapon of the reactionaries and is the main danger to the communist movement. The anti-Marxist and anti-communist views of modern revisionism, and its adaptation to capitalism, are particularly evident in the revisionist program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. This program, in its main content, is a right-wing opportunist program, the purpose of which is to revise the most important principles of Marxism-Leninism.

    Pospelov concluded by reading out the congratulatory message from the CPSU Central Committee. The message said: "The Danish Communist Party, together with all progressive forces, is actively struggling for lasting peace and friendship between the peoples of all countries, against the policy of submitting the country to aggressive blocs, and for the independence and national sovereignty of Denmark.

    The Danish Communist Party is loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and is repelling the attacks of revisionism and the attempts of revisionists to undermine the unity of the party.

    The CPSU Central Committee wishes the Danish Communist Party further organizational and ideological strengthening of its ranks, and wishes it success in the struggle for the vital rights and freedoms of the working people, and for peace and socialism."

    托姆森向丹共代表大会作中央工作报告
    反击修正主义  维护党的统一
    波斯别洛夫指出修正主义是共产主义运动主要危险
    据新华社柏林1日电　哥本哈根消息：丹麦共产党第二十次代表大会10月31日开幕。
    大会以一百四十二票对三十一票通过了开除中央委员莫尔基党籍的决定。
    在上午会议上，丹共中央书记托姆森作了中央委员会工作报告。
    托姆森在报告中对于党的领导内部的修正主义倾向、特别是党的前主席拉森的表现进行了批判和驳斥，并强调了丹共同各国共产党和工人党的团结一致。
    在谈到南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领时，报告指出，南共纲领草案的作者是现代修正主义者。他们企图在一系列重要问题上修改革命运动的基本原则，并欺骗工人。丹共中央驳斥和谴责了南共纲领草案中的种种修正主义论点。
    党中央的工作报告指出，党的前主席拉森的错误言论，同社会主义毫无共同之处。它给修正主义的理论和倾向大开方便之门。丹共中央反对这些论调，再一次地强调它坚决支持国际工人运动在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结一致。中央委员会再一次宣布它完全赞同各国共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议宣言。
    报告关于党的政治工作这一部分的主要注意力放在维护民主集中制原则上。托姆森指出，修正主义分子进攻民主集中制原则，要求在党内组织派别的自由。
    他继续说，我们要维护我们丹麦共产党，使它作为国际无产阶级大家庭的忠实的一员，我们要进行组织上、政治上和人员上的革新和调整，以保证党继续前进，保证得到工人阶级和全体劳动人民的支持。
    下午会议对托姆森的报告展开了讨论，在会上共有九个人发了言。
    苏联代表团团长、苏共中央主席团候补委员和苏共中央书记波斯别洛夫向大会致了贺词。他说，丹麦共产党进入了自己存在的第四十年，它在这个期间走过了一段漫长的、艰巨的斗争道路，维护了丹麦劳动人民的利益，维护了他们的社会权利和民主权利。
    波斯别洛夫说，在共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议以后的一年来，共产党和工人党进一步巩固了，它们的队伍在思想上和政治上加强了。这种情况引起了帝国主义反动派方面的新阴谋，它们企图不择手段地破坏国际共产主义运动的团结，摧残共产党和其他民主运动。他继续说，不能忘记，反动的资产阶级除了采取政治手段迫害民主力量以外，还采取思想斗争的方法，现在把主要赌注下在修正主义身上，以便从内部破坏共产党和工人党。修正主义是反动派的思想武器，是共产主义运动的主要危险。现代修正主义的反马克思主义、反共的观点，它适应资本主义的企图，特别明显地表现在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义纲领上。这个纲领就它的主要内容来说是一个右倾机会主义的纲领，其目的是要修正马克思列宁主义的最重要的原理。
    波斯别洛夫最后宣读了苏共中央的贺词。贺词中说：“丹麦共产党同全体进步力量一道，为持久和平和各国人民之间的友谊、为反对本国屈从于侵略集团的政策、为争取丹麦的独立和民族主权而积极奋斗。
    丹麦共产党忠于马克思列宁主义的原则，对修正主义的进攻、对修正主义者破坏党的团结的企图给予反击。
    苏共中央祝丹麦共产党在组织上和思想上进一步加强它的队伍，祝它在争取劳动人民的切身权利和自由、争取和平和社会主义的斗争中获得成就。”
