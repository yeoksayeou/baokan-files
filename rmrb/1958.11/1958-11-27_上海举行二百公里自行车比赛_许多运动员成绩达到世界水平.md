Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 26th: Shanghai's cyclists achieved excellent results in the men's 200-kilometer road bicycle race held on the 25th. The first place was won by Wang Awu, a 25-year-old manure cart worker from Pudong County, with a time of 5 hours, 1 minute, and 13.9 seconds. The second place went to Wang Chenglin, who recently surpassed the world's highest record in the men's 100-kilometer road bicycle race, with a time of 5 hours, 6 minutes, and 32.6 seconds. The third place was won by Weng Weisong, a worker from the Shanghai Resin Factory, with a time of 5 hours, 9 minutes, and 9.5 seconds. The fourth place went to Jin Qiqian, with a time of 5 hours, 27 minutes, and 11.3 seconds. Their results all exceeded the standard of 5 hours and 42 minutes for male athletes in the 200-kilometer road bicycle race set by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, and were better than the known international records for men's road bicycle races of similar distances. French athlete José Beyaert set the highest record of 5 hours, 18 minutes, and 12.6 seconds in the men's 120-mile and 194-yard road bicycle race at the 14th Olympic Games in 1948. Soviet athlete Biebienin set the highest record of 5 hours and 5 seconds in the men's 186-kilometer road bicycle team race at the 6th World Youth Festival and the 3rd World Youth Friendship Games in Moscow in 1957.

    The race was held on the streets of Shanghai's western suburbs and included more than sixty sharp turns throughout the course. The chief referee of the competition was national referee Jin Zhaojun.

    上海举行二百公里自行车比赛  许多运动员成绩达到世界水平
    新华社上海26日电　上海市自行车运动员在25日举行的男子二百公里公路自行车比赛中，创造了优异的成绩。第一名是浦东县二十五岁的踏粪车工人王阿五，成绩是五小时一分十三秒九。第二名是不久前超过男子一百公里公路自行车世界最高成绩的王成林，成绩是五小时六分三十二秒六。第三名是上海树脂厂工人翁维松，成绩五小时九分九秒五。第四名金其骞，成绩五小时二十七分十一秒三。他们的成绩都超过了国家体委规定的男子二百公里公路自行车五小时四十二分的运动健将的标准，并且比已经知道的国际上里程相近的男子公路自行车比赛的成绩要好。法国运动员乔斯·贝勒尔1948年在第十四届奥林匹克运动会上创造的男子一百二十英里一百九十四码公路自行车比赛的最高成绩是五小时十八分十二秒六。苏联运动员别别宁1957年在莫斯科第六届世界青年联欢节、第三届世界青年友谊运动会上创造的男子一百八十六公里公路自行车团体赛的最高成绩是五小时零五秒。
    这次比赛是在上海西郊街道上举行的，全程共有六十多个大拐弯。担任比赛总裁判的是国家裁判金兆均。
