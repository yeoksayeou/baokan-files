Anhui

Our correspondent from Hefei, 16th: Under the slogan "Three days of preparation, seven days of action, ten days and nights of hard work to guarantee the transportation of 100,000 tons of pig iron," the people of Anhui Province have launched a high tide of transferring pig iron to support steelmaking in Shanghai. The entire province transferred 30,541 tons of high-quality pig iron in a single day on the 11th, an increase of 50% compared to the total amount of pig iron transferred out of the province in early November.

From January to November 11 this year, Anhui has transferred a total of more than 275,000 tons of pig iron to various regions, including nearly 90,000 tons of good iron to Shanghai and other places from October 1 to November 11. In the external transfer of pig iron, various regions have overcome localism and decentralism, established an overall perspective, and embodied the communist spirit of putting others first and oneself last.

On the 11th of this month, the province launched a mass movement to transfer pig iron. More than 20 units in Hefei City with the task of transferring iron selected and reselected the pig iron before it left the factory. When it was transported to the freight yard for concentration and loading, it was reselected twice. Finally, large pieces of complete pig iron were loaded onto vehicles and transported away. All 2,586 tons of iron transported were of good quality. The steel plant of the Provincial Political and Legal Department originally had the task of transferring only 550 tons of iron. However, because the iron they produced was of good quality, they temporarily stopped the pig iron that was originally prepared to supply two factories in Hefei City for the manufacture of metallurgical equipment and transported an additional 150 tons of good iron to Shanghai.

On this day, the province, while producing, concentrating, and transporting, organized a 300,000-strong transportation army including workers, peasants, cadres, and students. It mobilized more than 250 cars and a large number of ships, trains and other modern transportation tools, as well as more than 23,000 flatbed trucks, wheelbarrows, and animal-drawn carts. Everywhere on major highways and waterways, there was a tense transportation scene. Jinzhai County in the Dabie Mountains mobilized more than 30,000 people, adopted the method of unified scheduling of vehicles and ships, unified use, and relay transportation, and concentrated more than 2,000 tons of pig iron from remote mountain areas to Meishan Station for loading and shipment within a day and night. Many county party secretaries and ministers also personally participated in the transportation battle.

Currently, the Party committees in various regions of the province are strengthening organizational leadership, fully mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and rationally arranging labor. They are determined to complete the glorious task of transferring 100,000 tons of pig iron in the next few days.

Shandong

Our correspondent from Jinan, 16th: The high-quality pig iron produced in Shandong Province is being continuously transported to Shanghai, Beijing, and other places to support steelmaking production.

In Shandong Province, the external transport of good iron has greatly increased in November. An average of about 3,000 tons of high-quality iron are shipped to Shanghai every day, and the highest daily shipment has exceeded 5,000 tons. This month, it is planned to ship 120,000 tons of good iron to Shanghai alone, which is more than 50% more than the total amount shipped in September and October.

These days, the main railway stations in Shandong are particularly busy. On the 11th and 12th, it rained all day, but the transportation and loading workers still fought hard in the rain, showing great enthusiasm for supporting Shanghai.

The Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China requires party secretaries at all levels to personally take charge of the external transfer of iron to ensure that the task of external transfer of good iron is completed on time; at the same time, it is also necessary to organize a certain amount of manpower and transportation capacity to achieve immediate production, immediate concentration, and immediate rush transportation. In order to fully support steelmaking in Shanghai, it has been decided that good iron is not allowed to be used for steelmaking in the province at present, and iron for other purposes will also be temporarily postponed.

Hunan

Our correspondent from Changsha, 16th: Hunan Province is carrying out a mass movement to rush the transfer of pig iron, and a large number of high-quality pig iron are being continuously transferred to key steel plants in Shanghai, Daye, and other places for steelmaking. Currently, more than 800,000 people throughout the province are participating in the transportation activities of transferring pig iron, and trains and fleets full of pig iron are continuously heading towards Shanghai and Wuhan from both land and water. In early November, the province transferred 18,350 tons of pig iron, and in the three days from the 11th to the 13th, the province transferred another 9,606 tons of pig iron, and more than 30,000 tons of pig iron have been concentrated at stations and docks. Party committees at all levels and counties have guaranteed to complete the glorious task of transferring 100,000 tons of pig iron out of the province before November 25.

Because the political task of external transfer of pig iron is very urgent, party committees at all levels have taken effective measures and launched a mass movement on a large scale. Lianyuan County organized large-scale troop operations, organizing the 120,000-strong transportation army participating in the iron transfer into regiments, battalions, companies, and platoons, and fully cared for the lives of the masses in the intense transportation, and the transportation efficiency was very high. From November 1 to 5, it transferred 10,000 tons of pig iron. You County had transferred 11,000 tons of pig iron in October, overfulfilling the external transfer task. Recently, they transferred another 5,272 tons of pig iron in three days.

Guangxi

Our correspondent from Nanning, 16th: Guangxi produced good iron to support Shanghai, and recently received a letter of thanks from the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. The enthusiasm of the steel army to support Shanghai's production is even more boiling.

Fighting in the six regions of Yulin, Liuzhou, Guilin, Nanning, Wuzhou, and Baise, the powerful transportation army, under the slogan of "The whole country is a chessboard, support Shanghai," worked tirelessly day and night, carrying pig iron from the blast furnaces scattered in the deep mountains and valleys to the transportation routes. As of the 14th, the entire autonomous region has increased the external transfer of pig iron to Shanghai to 24,833 tons.

In order to allow Shanghai's steelmaking furnaces to receive more good iron from Guangxi, the entire autonomous region has launched a movement to re-smelt all iron that does not meet national standards. More than 190 cupola furnaces in Liuzhou that can directly make steel have now been converted into blast furnace shapes and have all been transferred to the production line of smelting substandard iron and sintered iron into good iron. In the Nanning area, incomplete statistics up to the 12th show that another 3,367 indigenous blast furnaces have been put into operation to process substandard iron and sintered iron with slightly inferior quality. Guiping, Luzhai County, Wuzhou, Teng County and other places have already discovered a set of effective methods for handling substandard iron and sintered iron.

Fujian

Our correspondent from Fuzhou, 16th: The people on the steel front in Fujian Province are supporting steelmaking in Shanghai with the communist spirit of not leaving out a single jin or ounce. In the five days from the 11th to the 15th of this month, the province transferred 20,000 tons of pig iron to supply Shanghai.

Recently, Fujian is in the midst of the autumn harvest and on the eve of the decisive battle for steel production. However, after learning that Shanghai was short of pig iron, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee immediately instructed party committees in various regions on the 11th to immediately mobilize, resolutely implement the principle of ensuring key projects, and transfer 20,000 tons of pig iron to supply Shanghai steelmaking within a time limit of five days, and stipulated that all counties in the province should sweep out all the pig iron in stock and first transfer it to Shanghai. The pig iron needed for steelmaking and agricultural tool manufacturing in the province should be subordinate to Shanghai steelmaking. The instruction also pointed out that Shanghai steelmaking is the overall situation, and this province is a small situation, and the small situation must be subordinate to the overall situation.

In recent days, vehicles have been traveling back and forth on various highways, and railway stations have been crowded with people loading and transporting day and night. The people of Pingtan Island, located on the front line of coastal defense, overcame all difficulties in the gaps between battles and refined more than ten tons of pig iron. Hearing that they were going to support steelmaking in Shanghai, everyone was overjoyed and said: Although we have less pig iron, our determination to support Shanghai cannot fall behind others. On the same day, all the only seventeen tons of iron were loaded on ships and transported to Fuzhou for transshipment to Shanghai. The staff of the province's transportation departments transported pig iron day and night in the spirit of "making way for iron and giving priority to iron." Upon hearing the news of supporting steelmaking in Shanghai, the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front line in Fujian also immediately dispatched 310 vehicles to help with the rush transportation.

Jiangxi

Our correspondent from Nanchang, 16th: Jiangxi has taken emergency measures to launch a "rush ten-day" movement to accelerate the transfer of high-quality iron and scrap steel to support key steel plants in Shanghai.

In order to ensure the needs of Shanghai steel plants for pig iron and scrap steel, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee issued an emergency instruction to all regions on the 10th, requiring all regions in the province to immediately launch a rush ten-day movement from the 10th to the 20th to resolutely ensure the completion of the pig iron transfer task. The Provincial Party Committee also strictly stipulated that high-quality iron must be guaranteed to support Shanghai. High-quality iron is not allowed to be used in any region, and all of it must be shipped out. If local needs arise, priority should also be given to transfer, and local areas should try to use second-class iron.

After receiving the instructions, party committees in various regions immediately took action. The Ji'an Prefectural Committee has formed four working groups to go to various counties to supervise the battle. At the same time, the entire region has concentrated 138 vehicles to transport to various counties. In the Ganzhou area, Ganzhou, Shangrao, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Fuzhou and other special zones, a large amount of pig iron is also being urgently transferred. As of the 15th, the province has transferred more than 4,000 tons of high-quality iron and scrap steel to Shanghai, and the average daily transport volume has increased from 300 tons to more than 500 tons.

Zhejiang

Our correspondent from Hangzhou, 16th: Zhejiang Province is accelerating the transfer of high-quality pig iron to support steelmaking in Shanghai. People's communes in the province's plains, mountains, and islands are continuously carrying pig iron from various furnace groups to ports, stations, and concentration points using civilian handcarts, wheelbarrows, civilian boats, and fishing boats. To date, the province has transported more than 34,900 tons of pig iron and scrap steel to Shanghai, including more than 29,400 tons of high-quality pig iron.

Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China specifically held a telephone conference to arrange for various regions to seize the transfer of pig iron to support Shanghai, requiring that the pig iron transferred to Shanghai must be guaranteed in quality and quantity.

Jiangsu

Our correspondent from Nanjing, 16th: Jiangsu Province has transferred 6,500 tons of pig iron to support steelmaking in Shanghai from November 1 to 14.

Jiangsu Province has limited pig iron production due to lack of ore and coal, and coupled with the launch of the mechanical marshal in November, the province's pig iron production cannot keep up with demand. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China still insisted on implementing the principle of "supporting Shanghai first" and tried every means to transfer high-quality iron to support Shanghai. The Nanjing Automobile Manufacturing Plant itself needed 200 tons of pig iron, but when they received instructions on the transfer of pig iron, they unhesitatingly transferred all 255 tons of pig iron produced to Shanghai without deducting a single jin.

Shanxi

Our correspondent from Taiyuan, 16th: The pig iron recently transferred from Shanxi Province to key steel plants across the country, such as Beijing and Anshan, has been well received by these production units. The staff of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Metallurgy, who were responsible for the acceptance work in Shanxi, selected and tested the pig iron transferred to them, proving that the iron purity reached more than 90%.

Since the end of October, the key iron smelting areas in Shanxi Province have launched a movement to "support the whole country and ensure key projects" by transferring good iron, selecting the best quality pig iron and first transferring it to steel plants in Beijing, Anshan and other places. As of the 14th, the province had transferred more than 4,100 tons of high-quality pig iron to Beijing, Anshan and other places. And more than 10,000 tons have been concentrated along highways and railway stations, waiting to be shipped.

In order to transfer the best pig iron to key steel plants as soon as possible, the Changzhi and Yuci special zones in Shanxi Province organized thousands of vehicles and livestock to transport day and night. In the Taihang Mountains in southeastern Shanxi, nearly 5,000 small iron-wheeled vehicles and more than 10,000 pack mules are carrying pig iron from all directions along the mountain roads, concentrating the high-quality iron scattered in the mining areas and mountain valleys to the roadsides. Gaoping County organized a transportation army of nearly 10,000 people, and has transferred more than 1,000 tons of pig iron in ten days. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has stored more than 300 tons of pig iron to be transported at Yangquan Station. Upon hearing that Beijing, Anshan and other places needed it more urgently, they immediately gave it to their brother steel plants first. (Attached picture)

    好铁先给别人　小局服从大局
    全民突击运铁支援重点钢厂
    安徽
    本报合肥16日电  安徽人民在“三天准备，七天行动，苦战十昼夜，保证运出生铁十万吨”的口号下，掀起了一个调运生铁支援上海炼钢的高潮，全省在11日一天内就调出质量优良的生铁三万零五百四十一吨，比11月上旬全省外调生铁总数增加了50％。
    今年1月到11月11日，安徽调往各地的生铁共达二十七万五千多吨，其中从10月1日到11月11日，调给上海等地的好铁近九万吨。各地在外调生铁中，克服了本位主义和分散主义，树立了全局观点，体现了先别人后自己的共产主义精神。
    本月11日，全省掀起了一个全民调运生铁运动。合肥市有调铁任务的二十多个单位，在生铁出厂以前，都选了又选，运到货场集中和装车时，又精选了两次，最后把大块的、整段的生铁装车运走，运出的二千五百八十六吨铁都是好铁。省政法部门钢铁厂，原只有五百五十吨铁的外调任务，但因他们生产的铁质量好，就暂时停止了原来准备供应合肥市两个工厂制造冶金设备所需的生铁，给上海多运出一百五十吨好铁。
    这天，全省在边生产、边集中、边运送的情况下，组织了一支包括工、农、干部、学生等参加的三十万人运输大军，出动了二百五十多辆汽车和大批轮船、火车等现代运输工具，和平板车、独轮车、兽力车两万三千多辆。大小公路上、河道上，到处都出现了车水马龙的紧张运输景象。大别山区的金寨县发动了三万多人，采取车船统一调度，统一使用和接力运输的办法，在一昼夜间，就把两千多吨生铁从偏僻的山区集中到梅山车站装车启运。很多县的县委书记和部长也都亲自参加了运输战斗。
    现在，全省各地党委正加强组织领导，充分发动群众，依靠群众，合理安排劳力，决心要在最近几天完成外调生铁十万吨的光荣任务。
    山东
  本报济南16日电山东省生产的优质生铁正源源运往上海、北京等地，支援炼钢生产。
    山东省进入11月份，外运的好铁大大增加，每天光运往上海的优质铁就达三千吨左右，最高的一天曾外运五千吨以上。这个月计划光运往上海的好铁就有十二万吨，比9、10月份运去的总和还多50％。
    这几天山东境内各个主要火车站上显得特别忙碌，11、12日整天下雨，运输、装车工人们仍冒雨奋战，为支援上海表现出极高的热情。
    中共山东省委要求各级党委书记亲自抓好铁外调工作，保证好铁外调任务按时完成；同时还要组织一定的人力和运输力量，做到随产、随集中、随抢运。为了全力支援上海炼钢，决定目前省内炼钢一律不准使用好铁，其它方面用铁也暂缓拨付。
    湖南
  本报长沙16日电湖南省正在开展一个突击调运生铁的群众运动，把大批质量优良的生铁，源源调运到上海、大冶等地重点钢厂炼钢。现在，全省每天有八十多万人参加调运生铁的运输活动，装满生铁的列车和船队，源源不断地从水、陆两路向上海和武汉进发。11月上旬，全省调出生铁一万八千三百五十吨，在11日到13日三天内，全省又调出生铁九千六百零六吨，并有三万多吨生铁已集运到车站和码头。各地、县委都保证在11月25日之前，完成全省外调十万吨生铁的光荣任务。
    由于外调生铁的政治任务十分紧急，各级党委都采取有力措施，大搞群众运动。涟源县组织大兵团作战，把参加调铁的十二万运输大军组织成团、营、连、排，并在紧张的运输中充分关心群众生活，运输效率很高，从11月1日到5日，就调出生铁一万吨。攸县在10月份已调出生铁一万一千吨，超额完成外调任务，最近，他们在三天内又调出五千二百七十二吨生铁。
    广西
  本报南宁16日电广西生产好铁支援上海，最近收到上海市委的感谢电，钢铁大军支援上海的生产热潮更加沸腾。
    奋战在玉林、柳州、桂林、南宁、梧州、百色六个地区的强大运输大军，在“全国一盘棋，支援大上海”的口号下，风餐野宿，披星戴月，从分散在深山野谷的高炉旁把生铁赶运到交通沿线。截至14日止，全自治区已经外调上海生铁已增加到两万四千八百三十三吨。
    为使上海炼钢炉子吃到广西更多的好铁，全自治区又掀起一个对一切不符合国家规定标准的铁的回炉重炼运动。柳州市一百九十多个能够直接炼钢的冲天炉现在都已改成高炉型状，全部转入把次铁和烧结铁炼成好铁的生产行列。南宁地区到12日止不完全统计，投入处理质量稍差的次铁和烧结铁的土高炉又有三千三百六十七个。桂平、鹿寨县、梧州、藤县等地都已经摸出一套处理次铁和烧结铁的有效办法。
    福建
    本报福州16日电福建省钢铁战线上的人民以一斤不少，一两不留的共产主义协作精神支援上海炼钢。从本月11日到15日五天之内，全省调运二万吨生铁供应上海。
    最近福建正处于秋收大忙阶段和钢铁生产决战的前夜。但是中共福建省委得悉上海炼钢缺少生铁的情况以后，即于11日指示各地党委立即动员起来，坚决贯彻保证重点的方针，限期在五天之内调足二万吨生铁供应上海炼钢，并规定：全省各县库存的生铁，一律扫地出门，先调上海。省内炼钢和农具制造所需的生铁应服从上海炼钢。指示中还指出上海炼钢是大局，本省是小局，小局要服从大局。
    连日来，各公路线车辆往返如梭，火车站人山人海日夜装运。地处海防前线的平潭岛人民，在坚持战斗的空隙中，排尽万难，炼出十多吨生铁，听说要支援上海炼钢，大家都喜出望外地说：我们生铁虽少，但支援上海决心不能落在别人后面。当天就把仅有的十七吨铁全部装船运到福州转运上海。全省交通运输部门职工本着“逢铁让路，见铁先行”的精神，日夜启程运送生铁。战斗在福建前线的解放军听到支援上海炼钢的消息，也立即调出三百一十辆汽车帮助突击运输。
    江西
    本报南昌16日电江西采取紧急措施，开展“突击旬”运动，加速调运优质铁和废钢铁支援上海重点钢厂。
    为确保上海钢厂对生铁、废钢铁的需要，中共江西省委在10日向各地发出了紧急指示，要求全省各地从10日到20日立即开展一个突击旬运动，坚决保证生铁调运任务的完成。省委并严格规定，保证优质铁支援上海，凡是优质铁各地一律不准动用，要全部运出，如本地需要，亦应首先服从调运，本地尽量利用二类铁。
    各地党委接到指示后，已立即行动起来。吉安地委已组成四个工作组下到各县督战。与此同时，全区集中了一百三十八辆汽车分往各县运输。赣南地区，上饶、南昌、九江、抚州等专区，大量生铁也正在加紧调运中。到15日为止，全省调运上海的优质铁和废钢铁，已达四千余吨，平均日运量由三百吨提高到五百余吨。浙　江
  本报杭州16日电浙江省加速调运优质生铁支援上海炼钢，全省平原山区海岛等地人民公社以民用手拉车、独轮车、民船渔船川流不息地把生铁从各炉群载运到港口车站各集中点。到目前止，全省已有三万四千九百多吨生铁和废钢铁运往上海，其中优质生铁有二万九千四百多吨。
    最近，中共浙江省委专门召开了电话会议，布置各地抓紧调运生铁支援上海的工作，要求调往上海的生铁一定要保质保量。
    江苏
    本报南京16日电江苏省从11月1日到14日已经调运出六千五百吨生铁支援上海炼钢。
    江苏省因为缺乏矿石和煤炭，生铁产量有限，加上11月份机械元帅上马，因此，省内生铁生产跟不上需要，但是中共江苏省委仍坚持贯彻“支援上海第一”的方针，千方百计地调运优质铁支援上海。南京市汽车制配厂本身需要二百吨生铁，但当他们接到关于调运生铁的指示之后，毫不犹疑地将生产出来的二百五十五吨生铁一斤不扣地全部调运给上海。
    山西
    本报太原16日电山西省最近调给北京、鞍山等全国重点钢厂的生铁，获得这些生产单位的好评。北京市冶金局在山西负责验收的工作人员把调给他们的生铁选样化验，证明含铁纯度达到90％以上。
    从10月未开始，山西省各重点炼铁地区就开展了“支援全国、保证重点”的调运好铁运动，挑选质量最好的优质生铁首先调给北京、鞍山等地炼钢厂。截至14日为止，全省已经调往北京、鞍山等地的优质生铁达四千一百多吨。并有一万多吨已集中到公路沿线和铁路车站，正待启运。
    为把最好的生铁尽快调给重点钢厂，山西省长治、榆次两个专区组织了成千上万的车辆和牲畜日夜赶运。在晋东南太行山区，每天有近五千辆小铁轮车和一万多头驮骡，满载生铁从四面八方沿山路把分散在矿区和山沟里的优质铁集中到公路沿线。高平县组织了近万人的运输大军，十天已调运生铁一千多吨。太原钢铁公司在阳泉车站储备了三百多吨待运的生铁，一听北京、鞍山等地要的更急，便立刻先让给了兄弟钢厂。（附图片）
