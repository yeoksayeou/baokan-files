Agricultural Products Enter the City, Industrial Products Go to the Countryside
Henan's Commercial Grand Competition: Purchase, Process, Transport, and Store Locally by Communes / Tianjin Explores Sources of Goods to Meet Peak Season Market Needs, Prioritizing Winter Goods for the Countryside

(Reported by this newspaper) Henan Province has launched a comprehensive high tide of agricultural product procurement. According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the Henan Provincial Party Committee held two telephone conferences on October 25th and 29th, attended by the Party Committees of prefectures and cities, to specifically deploy the procurement and transportation of agricultural products. Party committees at all levels directly lead this work, making key overall arrangements. The broad masses of commune members in the people's communes throughout the province have made a hundredfold effort, worked hard, and achieved brilliant results.

By the end of October, Henan Province's grain purchase had exceeded 6.3 billion jin; cotton unified purchase exceeded 6.2 million dan; sesame exceeded 110 million jin; flue-cured tobacco exceeded 310 million jin; bast fiber exceeded 36 million jin; and live pig purchases reached 2.18 million heads. Transportation work is also being strengthened, with large quantities of wheat, oil, cotton, live pigs, etc., being transferred out of the province. Financial work and bank loan collection and savings work have also made significant progress.

The main reason for the rapid progress of the agricultural product procurement movement in Henan Province is that politics is in command. Under the principle of "taking steel as the key link to drive everything else," extensive debates were carried out to arm the minds of cadres. This enabled everyone to recognize the new situation, raise their thinking, and boost their enthusiasm.

Henan Province implemented the policy of launching a mass movement in the procurement of agricultural products. The method is to carry out red flag competitions. The Party committee makes overall arrangements, properly arranging receiving points and transfer points. On the other hand, mobilize the masses and organize shock teams of thousands of troops. For example, Xiping, Shangcai, Xinyang, Shangcheng, Zhengyang, Runan, Suixian, and other counties worked hard for one or two days and nights to complete and overfulfill the annual plans for more than ten items, including the purchase of grain, cotton, oil, tobacco, hemp, pigs, scrap iron and steel, scrap copper, financial revenue, savings, and loan collection. Because some regions launched "satellites" and took the lead, followed by a surge of enthusiasm, which aroused the revolutionary drive of the broad masses of cadres and the masses in various places, further promoting a new high tide of competition.

Another feature of Henan Province's agricultural product procurement, processing, and transportation work this year is the adoption of the "four localizations" method. That is, resolutely decentralizing financial and trade institutions to the communes, implementing local procurement by communes, local processing by communes, local transportation by communes, and local storage by communes. This is an important reason why many regions quickly completed their tasks. Therefore, people say that the "four localizations" method is the specific application of the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy in agricultural product procurement work.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 13th. The broad masses of employees in Tianjin's commercial departments are doing everything possible to explore sources of goods, carry out a large-scale purchasing and sales campaign, and increase the supply of industrial products to the rural peak season market. The total value of industrial products planned to be supplied to various regions in the second half of this year will increase by 62% compared with the same period last year.

With the rapid development of agricultural production and the high tide of rural people's communes, the demand for commodities in rural areas has undergone great changes. Some items that were previously considered slow-selling, such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, and leather belts, have now become best-selling goods.

In order to adapt to the new situation in the rural market, Tianjin's commercial departments launched a "five satisfactions" movement from September, centered on completing plans according to policies, supporting production with large purchases and sales, and facilitating purchases and sales to meet needs (satisfying the state, people's communes, the masses, cooperative departments, and financial and trade employees).

Because Party committees at all levels let go and mobilized the masses, the large-scale purchasing and sales movement centered on "five satisfactions" quickly unfolded vigorously. Purchasing and supply stations launched a competition upsurge in which everyone offered ideas, everyone contributed suggestions, and everyone acted as a purchaser, using methods such as saving substitutes, tapping production potential, and social materials to do everything possible to find sources of goods and expand purchases and sales. Employees of the pharmaceutical purchasing and supply station used their rest time to sort out more than 300 kinds of incomplete commodities worth more than 2 million yuan that were pressed in the warehouse, and repaired and fitted them to become good commodities. Employees of the department store purchasing and supply station went deep into dozens of factories and production cooperatives to tap production potential and inventory materials, and organized a total of more than 13 million yuan of goods, equivalent to 20% of the fourth quarter purchasing plan.

Under the current extremely tight transportation capacity, Tianjin's commercial departments, in addition to prioritizing the transportation of urgently needed production materials and winter goods to various regions, specially organized a shock transportation team of more than 2,000 people. They also strengthened cooperation with the transportation departments, adopting the combination of light and heavy goods for loading to increase the loading capacity of goods, and promptly learned about the return empty trains in the Northeast, and rushed to load the goods waiting to be transported. They seized this opportunity and loaded more than 140 train carriages of goods in just one day. (Attached picture)

### 农产品进城  工业品下乡  河南商业大竞赛就社收购就社加工就社调运就社保管  天津市挖掘货源满足旺季市场需要冬令商品优先下乡

    农产品进城  工业品下乡
    河南商业大竞赛就社收购就社加工就社调运就社保管  天津市挖掘货源满足旺季市场需要冬令商品优先下乡
    本报讯　河南省已掀起了全面农业品采购高潮。根据中共中央和国务院的指示，河南省委在10月25日和29日召开了两次地、市委参加的电话会议，具体部署了对农产品收购调运工作。各级党委直接领导这一工作，进行有重点地统筹安排。各地区人民公社广大社员群众百倍努力，苦战苦干，获得了辉煌战果。
    到10月底为止，河南省粮食征购已超过六十三亿斤；棉花统购超过六百二十万担；芝麻超过一亿一千万斤；烤烟超过三亿一千万斤；麻类超过三千六百万斤；生猪收购二百一十八万头。调运工作也在加强，正向省外调出大批的小麦、油脂、棉花、生猪等。财政工作和银行收贷和储蓄工作，也都有较大的进展。
    河南省采购农产品运动进展得快的主要原因，是由于政治挂了帅，在“以钢为纲带动全面”的原则下，开展大辩论，武装干部的思想。使大家认清了新形势，提高思想，鼓足干劲。
    河南省在农产品采购中贯彻了大搞群众运动的方针。办法就是开展红旗竞赛。由党委统筹安排，把接收点和转运点摆布好；另一方面发动群众，组织千军万马的突击队伍。如西平、上蔡、信阳、商城、正阳、汝南、睢县等县，都是苦战一两昼夜，完成并超额完成粮、棉、油、烟、麻、猪、废钢铁、杂铜的收购和财政收入以及储蓄、收贷等十数项的全年计划。由于有的地区卫星上天，一马当先，随之万马奔腾，鼓起各地广大干群的革命干劲，于是更加推进了新的竞赛高潮。
    河南省今年农产品采购、加工、调运工作中的另一个特点，是采用了“四就”的方法。这就是，把财贸机构坚决下放到公社，实行就社收购、就社加工、就社调运、就社保管。这是许多地区迅速完成任务的重要原因。所以人们说，“四就”方法是“小、土、群”方针在农产品采购工作中的具体运用。
    本报天津13日电　天津市商业部门广大职工千方百计挖掘货源，开展大购大销运动，增加对农村旺季市场工业品的供应量。今年下半年计划供应各地的工业品总值比去年同期增加62％。
    随着农业生产的飞跃发展和农村人民公社化的高潮，农村对商品的需要发生了很大变化。一些过去被认为是滞销的牙膏、牙刷、皮腰带等如今都成为畅销货了。
    为了适应农村市场的新形势，天津市商业部门从9月份起就开展了以按照政策完成计划、大购大销支持生产、购销方便满足需要等为中心的“五满意”（国家、人民公社、群众、协作部门和财贸职工）运动。
    由于各级党委放手发动群众，以“五满意”为中心的大购大销运动，很快就轰轰烈烈的开展起来。各采购供应站掀起了人人出主意、个个献良策、人人作进货员的竞赛热潮，采用节约代用、挖掘生产潜力、社会物资等方法，千方百计地寻找货源扩大购销。医药采购供应站职工利用休息时间，把压在仓库里的价值二百多万元的三百多种残缺商品清理出来，加以修配变成了好的商品。百货采购供应站职工深入数十个工厂、生产合作社，挖生产潜力和库存物资，共组织了一千三百多万元的货源，相当于第四季度进货计划的20％。
    在当前运输力极度紧张的情况下，天津市商业部门除把各地急需的生产资料和冬令商品优先调运外，专门组织了有二千多人参加的突击运输大队。他们还加强和交通运输部门的配合，采用轻重商品搭配装载，提高商品装载量，并及时了解东北回空火车，突击装运待运物资，他们抓住这个时机，仅一天，就装出一百四十多个车皮的货物。（附图片）
