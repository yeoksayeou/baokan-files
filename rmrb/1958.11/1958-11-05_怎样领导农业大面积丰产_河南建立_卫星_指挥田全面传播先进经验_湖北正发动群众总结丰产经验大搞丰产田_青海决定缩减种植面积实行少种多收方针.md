How to Lead Large-Scale Agricultural Bumper Harvests
    Henan Establishes “Satellite” Command Fields to Comprehensively Disseminate Advanced Experience
    Hubei is Mobilizing the Masses to Summarize Bumper Harvest Experiences and Vigorously Develop Bumper Harvest Fields
    Qinghai Decides to Reduce Planting Area and Implement the Policy of Planting Less and Harvesting More

    This newspaper reports: Henan Province has created a good method of managing large-scale "satellite" command fields to guide production. This new leadership method has already played a positive role in the current wheat production.
    Henan Province planted 80 million mu of wheat this year, and aims to increase the unit area yield from the original 270+ jin to over 1,000 jin next year. To achieve this grand leap forward target, simply relying on past methods of issuing official documents or having a few cadres engage in small-scale experimental fields is far from meeting the needs of objective situations and mass production. To solve this problem, during wheat sowing, organizations at all levels, based on the advanced experience of this year's agricultural "satellite" launches, established approximately 30 million mu of high-yield "satellite" fields throughout the province, requiring a yield of over 5,000 jin per mu, as a basic measure to strive for a major leap forward in production next year. In addition, more than one million mu of "satellite" command fields with a yield of over 10,000 jin per mu were designated from the total cultivated area, distributed like stars across every corner of the province. In these "satellite" command fields, comprehensive yield-increasing technologies such as irrigation water and fertilization are creatively promoted, advanced experiences from various aspects are concentrated, and examples are set in every production link. In this way, the surrounding "satellite" fields and large fields are organically connected through the commune or area, forming a network of bumper harvest satellites that can disseminate various advanced experiences and direct the large-scale bumper harvest movement at any time. This year, the Kaifeng Special District has a wheat sowing area of over 8 million mu, of which "satellite" command fields requiring a yield of over 10,000 jin per mu account for 150,000 mu, and 3 million mu require over 5,000 jin per mu. Grasping these two items alone can yield more than 16.5 billion jin of grain. With a population of 4.5 million in the district, each person can obtain an average of 3,690 jin, enough to eat for more than seven years. In order to realize this bold plan and better leverage the guiding role of the "satellite" command fields, the district committee recently convened a "satellite" command field conference. After overall planning, with the satellite command fields as the core and the commune as the unit, a "satellite" command network was universally established throughout the district, with dedicated personnel responsible to the end. Registration cards were created, technical operation files and "field chief" systems for the "satellite" fields were established, and new problems and experiences in production were regularly checked and summarized for timely resolution and promotion. During the wheat sowing stage in Shuipo Township, Kaifeng County, uneven sowing density occurred. At this time, the township party secretary and "satellite" field chief Liu Zhenjiang immediately summoned the heads of the "satellite" fields and drilling machine operators from the entire township to conduct a sowing demonstration together in his "satellite" command field, identify good methods, and quickly promote them. In the end, the wheat in the entire township reached the standards of straight row spacing, uniform sowing width, consistent depth, and no missing seedlings or broken ridges. (Qu Mingzhen)

    This newspaper reports: Mobilizing the masses to vigorously develop large-scale bumper harvest fields has been proven to be a powerful measure to organize a great leap forward in agriculture in Hubei Province this year. Currently, party committees at all levels are further promoting this practice, already familiar to the broad masses, throughout the province to create conditions for an even greater leap forward in agriculture next year.
    The large-scale bumper harvest fields that have emerged in the vast rural areas of Hubei Province this year are called bumper harvest “fans” and “gangs” in some places, and bumper harvest zones and “chongs” in others.
    Various large-scale bumper harvest fields are organized with cadre experimental fields as the core or base point. The yield increase targets and measures of the bumper harvest fields are more advanced than those of ordinary fields in the area, while the cadre experimental fields are even more advanced than them. Usually, when promoting an advanced technology that is considered relatively reliable, experimental fields and bumper harvest fields can act simultaneously; if the technology to be promoted is not yet certain or the masses participating in breeding bumper harvest fields are unwilling to accept it, the experimental fields will first demonstrate it, and then promote it through on-site meetings.
    Large-scale bumper harvest fields can play a huge role in promoting the comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production because: First, it becomes a good place to promote new technologies and disseminate new technologies. Situations in various places show that the various creations of experimental fields, influencing ordinary fields through large-scale bumper harvest fields, are more effective than directly influencing ordinary fields. Second, cadres, after planting small-area experimental fields and managing large-area bumper harvest fields, are more likely to conduct in-depth and comprehensive leadership, preventing the tendency of burying themselves in a small experimental field without asking about others. Third, it can further stimulate the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and break various superstitions. In the past, although obtaining high yields in experimental fields had a profound impact on the broad masses, there were still some people who believed that: high yields were possible in small areas, but not in large areas. When large-scale bumper harvest fields appeared, this superstitious thinking was broken, so that this part of the people also confidently leaped forward boldly.
    After summarizing the experience of vigorously developing large-scale bumper harvest fields in various places this year, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to further promote and develop it, in order to create conditions for obtaining greater agricultural bumper harvests next year. Judging from the current situation of sowing wheat and rapeseed in various places, the area of large-scale bumper harvest fields has increased significantly compared to last year. Generally, the large-scale bumper harvest fields for wheat and rapeseed, which the counties plan to produce one to four times higher than ordinary fields, generally account for 10% to 20% of similar fields. The proportion of large-scale bumper harvest fields for rice and cotton in similar fields generally accounts for 20% to 30%, and some even account for more than 50%, and the planned yield targets are two to six times higher than those of ordinary fields.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 4th: Qinghai Province has decided to reduce a portion of the planting area and implement the policy of planting less and harvesting more to increase the total output of crops next year.
    Qinghai Province has more land than people, with an average of more than ten mu of land cultivated per labor force, and some areas as many as twenty mu or so. Although some shallow mountain land requires a lot of labor, seeds, and fertilizer, the harvest is not large and affects the intensive cultivation of flatland paddy fields. Therefore, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently decided to resolutely change the past cultivation method of extensive planting and low harvest, implement the policy of planting less and harvesting more, and reduce the sowing area next year. The reduced portion is mostly shallow mountain dry land with inconvenient transportation, difficult fertilization and watering, large slopes, severe soil erosion, and small yields. After reducing this portion of the area, intensive cultivation can be carried out on fertile land to generally increase the unit area yield, and high-yielding bumper harvests can be implemented on 10% to 15% of the planting area. In this way, the total grain output of the province next year can be increased several times compared to this year. The reduced land will be planted with forage and feed, etc.
    In order to achieve the goal of planting less and harvesting more, it is necessary to implement the yield increase measures of sufficient water, adequate fertilizer, deep plowing, good seeds, close planting, tool reform, and disaster prevention. At present, the main task is to carry out a concentrated deep plowing of the land. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference on the evening of October 30, requiring all localities to earnestly implement it. Qinghai has a cold climate, and only twenty or so days remain before freezing. The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to immediately organize labor, widely promote rope-pulled machines, and universally plow the 7.5 million mu of land once, of which 4.5 million mu of land should be deeply plowed by more than one chi, and bumper harvest fields should be deeply plowed by three to five chi. At the same time, it is necessary to once again launch a movement to accumulate fertilizer, manufacture native fertilizer, winter irrigation, construct water conservancy projects, and reform agricultural tools, especially close-planting agricultural tools.

    怎样领导农业大面积丰产
    河南建立“卫星”指挥田全面传播先进经验
    湖北正发动群众总结丰产经验大搞丰产田
    青海决定缩减种植面积实行少种多收方针
    本报讯　河南省创造出一种搞大面积“卫星”指挥田以生产指导生产的好办法。这种新的领导方法，对当前小麦生产已起到良好作用。
    河南省今年种植小麦八千万亩，要求明年单位面积产量由原来的二百七十多斤，提高到一千斤以上。实现这个宏伟的跃进指标，单纯依靠过去下达公文指示或少数干部搞小片试验田的领导方法，远远不能适应客观形势发展和群众生产的需要。为了解决这个问题，在麦播当中，各级组织根据今年农业大放“卫星”的先进经验，在全省范围内大约搞有三千万亩要求亩产五千斤以上的高产“卫星”田，作为争取明年生产大跃进的基本措施。另外还从农田总面积中划出一百多万亩亩产万斤以上的“卫星”指挥田，星罗棋布地分布在全省各个角落。在这些“卫星”指挥田里，创造性地推行灌溉用水，施肥等综合性的增产技术，集中多方面的先进经验，每个生产环节都做出榜样，这样，通过社或片有机地把周围的“卫星”田和大田连接起来，组成一个个丰产卫星网，随时可以传播各种先进经验，指挥大面积丰产运动。开封专区今年麦播面积八百多万亩，其中，要求亩产万斤以上的
  “卫星”指挥田占十五万亩，亩产五千斤以上的三百万亩，抓住这两项就可收粮食一百六十五亿多斤，全区四百五十万人口，每人平均可得三千六百九十斤，可以饱吃七年多。地委为实现这个大胆的规划，更好地发挥“卫星”指挥田的指导作用，最近专门召开了“卫星”指挥田会议，经过统筹安排，以卫星指挥田为核心，以社为单位，全区普遍成立了“卫星”指挥网，确定专人负责到底，登记卡片，建立
  “卫星”田技术操作档案和“田长”制度，定期检查总结生产上出现的新问题、新经验，以便及时解决，推广。开封县水坡乡在试播小麦阶段，发生了播种稀稠不匀的现象，这时，乡党委书记、“卫星”田长刘振江等就立即把全乡“卫星”田负责人和摇耧手召集起来，共同在他的“卫星”指挥田里进行播种表演，找出好办法，迅速推广开来。最后，全乡麦子都达到行距笔直、播幅均匀、深浅一致、没有缺苗断垅的标准。　（曲明振）
    本报讯　发动群众大搞大面积丰产田，今年已在湖北省被证明是一种组织农业大跃进的有力措施。目前，各级党委正在把这种已为广大群众所熟悉的作法，进一步在全省范围内推广，为明年全省农业的更大跃进创造条件。
    今年湖北省广大农村中出现的大面积丰产田，有的地方叫丰产畈、丰产岗，有的地方叫丰产区、丰产冲。
    各种大面积的丰产田都是以干部试验田为核心或基点来组织的。丰产田的增产指标和措施，都比所在地区的一般田先进，而干部试验田又比它们还先进些。通常情况是在推行一项已经被认为是较有把握的先进技术时，试验田和丰产田可以同时行动；假如要推行的技术措施还没有把握或参加育种丰产田的群众还不肯接受时，就先由试验田示范，然后再通过现场会推广。
    大面积的丰产田能够对农业生产的全面跃进起到巨大的推动作用，是因为：第一、它成为推行新技术和传播新技术的良好园地。各地情况都说明，试验田的各种创造，通过大面积的丰产田去影响普通田，收效比直接影响普通田要快得多。第二、干部既种小面积的试验田又管大面积的丰产田后，更便于进行深入的、全面的领导，防止埋头于一小块试验田而不问其它的倾向。第三、可以进一步激发群众的革命干劲，破除各种迷信。过去，试验田获得高产虽然在广大群众中有深刻的影响，但也还有一部分人认为：小面积能高产大面积就不行。当大面积丰产田出现后，这种迷信思想就被冲破，从而使这一部分人也信心充沛地大胆跃进了。
    湖北省各级中共党委总结了今年各地大搞大面积丰产田的经验后，已决定进一步加以推广和发展，以便为明年获得更大的农业丰产创造条件。从目前各地播种小麦、油菜的情况看，大面积丰产田已较去年有巨大的增加。各县计划比普通田产量高出一倍到四倍的小麦、油菜大面积丰产田，一般都占到同类田的10％到20％水稻、棉花的大面积丰产田在同类田中所占的比重，一般都占到20％到30％，也有占到50％以上的，而且产量计划指标比普通田要高出二倍到六倍以上。

    据新华社西宁4日电　青海省决定缩减一部分种植面积，实行少种多收来提高明年农作物的总产量。
    青海省地多人少，平均每个劳动力种地十亩以上，有的地区多到二十亩左右。有些浅山土地虽然费了很多劳力、籽种、肥料，但是收获不大，并且影响到对平地水田的精耕细作。因此，中共青海省委最近决定坚决改变以往广种薄收的耕作方法，实行少种多收的方针，缩减明年的播种面积。缩减的部分，多是交通不便、施肥浇水困难、坡度大、水土流失严重、收获量不大的浅山旱地。缩减这一部分面积后，就可以在肥沃的土地上精耕细作，普遍提高单位面积产量，其中10％到15％的种植面积还可以实行大面积高额丰产。这样，全省明年粮食总产量就可以比今年增加几倍。缩减的土地将种植饲草饲料等。
    为了达到少种多收的目的，就要贯彻水饱、肥足、深耕、良种、密植、工具改革和防灾等项增产措施，当前主要是突击深翻地。为此，省委在10月30日晚召开了电话会议，要求各地认真执行。青海气候较冷，距离封冻只剩下二十多天了。省委要求各地立即组织劳力，广泛推广绳索牵引机，把七百五十万亩土地普遍翻耕一次，其中四百五十万亩土地要深翻一尺以上，丰产田要深翻三尺到五尺。同时，要再度掀起一个积肥、制造土化肥、冬灌、兴修水利、改革农具特别是密植农具的运动。
