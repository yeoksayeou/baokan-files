Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, November 21st: Bengbu No. 3 Middle School in Anhui Province, in implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, has actively adopted various measures to improve the quality of teaching. Since the beginning of February this year, the quality of mathematics has been continuously rising along with the development of work-study programs.

Bengbu No. 3 Middle School has 23 ordinary classes in its senior and junior high school departments. After the school established a factory, the factory also established a school, enrolling eight classes of students. In total, the school has more than 1,700 students. Since the beginning of February this year, the school has actively launched work-study activities, vigorously establishing factories and farms. It has now set up 13 workshops for fitting, turning, forging, foundry, chemical engineering, carpentry, art, model making, and textbooks. It has also jointly established the "Red Flag Farm" with other schools, covering more than 400 mu. In the vigorous campaign for steel production, it has actively engaged in iron smelting and coking. In addition, students sometimes work as auxiliary workers in factories and engage in transportation work.

Students learn and labor simultaneously, achieving great success in productive labor, and the quality of teaching has also significantly improved. According to preliminary statistics, students across the school have completed 83,000 workdays since the summer vacation. More than 200 people have learned plowing and sowing, more than 200 people have learned foundry work, and 80% of the people have learned iron smelting. In various workshops, many students have reached the level of third-grade technicians. Compared with the second semester of 1957, the overall average scores of the students in this school increased by 13.6 points in the junior high school department and 4.6 points in the senior high school department during the end-of-term exams this summer, with the overall score increasing by 7.65 points. In the past, the average score for physics in Senior Grade 3 (1) class was only 60 points, but this summer, the average score increased to 82 points; in the past, the average score for chemistry was only 68 points, but this summer, it increased to 85 points. Some subjects, such as geography and history, have eliminated failing grades. The improvement in Chinese language class is also very significant. Before the work-study program, students' compositions were full of empty words and failed to express their meaning clearly. Teachers would only assign topics such as "Spring Colors Fill the Garden" to describe the campus, and students could only write articles about spring flowers and autumn moons, lacking any real content. After the work-study program, students' lives became richer, and their vocabulary also expanded. When smelting steel, they wrote about smelting steel; when farming, they wrote about farming. Their content was substantial, with flesh and blood. In the past, each student would only write three to five articles per semester and often failed to submit their assignments on time. This summer vacation, many students wrote 20 to 30 articles during their labor. Students also wrote poems, folk songs, and essays. The entire school wrote more than 40,000 folk songs since the summer vacation.

Bengbu No. 3 Middle School, in implementing the Party's education policy, has always attached great importance to improving the quality of teaching. First of all, this spring, the school organized all teachers and students to universally and systematically study the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, clarifying the significant meaning of combining education with productive labor. Through a large-scale debate, the school made all teachers and students realize that combining education with productive labor is precisely to improve the quality of education, so that the school can cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, and cultivate working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert. Secondly, the school made appropriate arrangements for the time spent on teaching and labor, adhering to the system of four days of study and two days of labor per week. Except for a portion of the courses that were taught in conjunction with labor, and the teaching hours were slightly reduced, the teaching hours for general basic courses such as Chinese language, mathematics, physics, and chemistry were not reduced. In the past, there were only four to five classes per day, about 30 class hours per week. Now, there are generally six classes per day, still maintaining about 25 class hours per week. Thirdly, the school adopted a teaching method that combined theory with practice. All teachers were assigned to related workshops and farms. For example, biology teachers were assigned to farms and animal and plant specimen workshops, and physics teachers were assigned to fitting and turning workshops. In addition to classroom teaching, some courses were moved to workshops, farms, construction sites, and iron smelting furnaces for teaching, and some courses were also moved to factories, farms, and people's communes outside the school as needed. For example, when the chemistry class discussed glass, the students were taken to a glass factory; when the physics class discussed machinery, the students were taken to a machinery factory; when the political common sense class discussed people's communes, the students were taken to the people's communes to visit and learn. Fourthly, the school specifically arranged productive labor according to the students' age, knowledge, and the different courses they were studying, so that productive labor and learning were closely integrated. For example, first and second grade students studying plants and animals participated in agricultural labor, responsible for raising poultry and livestock, and making plant and animal specimens. High school students studying physiology were assigned to make physiological models, those studying physics were assigned to electrical, fitting, and turning workshops, and those studying chemistry were assigned to chemical engineering workshops. In this way, after students learned in the classroom, they then engaged in hands-on labor, learning and doing at the same time, which integrated theory with practice, making it easier for students to consolidate the knowledge they learned. Cao Dezhen, a student in Senior Grade 3 (2) class, had previously failed geography. Later, she participated in the labor of making map models. By repairing molds, coloring, and pasting place names, she remembered clearly where there were mountains, where there was water, and what the place was. Now, her geography grades are very good. She said: "After making map models, I will never forget the geography I learned in my entire life."

Bengbu No. 3 Middle School, in implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, has constantly paid attention to carrying out the struggle between the two lines and doing a good job in ideological education. At the beginning, some teachers doubted whether combining education with productive labor could improve the quality of education. The school Party organization organized all teachers and students to study various documents related to combining education with productive labor, and carried out large-scale debates, explaining the principles, presenting the facts, and refuting various skeptical arguments. After the Party's education policy began to be accepted by the majority of teachers and students and they universally participated in productive labor, the school Party organization promptly criticized the idea held by some teachers and students that only labor was necessary, not study, or that it was impossible to study well if one participated in productive labor. The school's Party organization believed that the purpose of the Party's education policy was to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, to cultivate working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert, and to gradually eliminate the difference between manual and mental labor. Therefore, various methods must be adopted to closely integrate teaching and productive labor, so that students can not only widely participate in productive labor, improve their class consciousness, and master production knowledge, but also ensure that students study basic courses well. Only in this way can the Party's education policy be correctly implemented.

    要劳动也要读书　生产好学习也好
    蚌埠三中教学质量步步上升
    新华社合肥21日电　安徽省蚌埠市第三中学在贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针中，积极采取各种措施提高教学质量，从今年2月初以来，数学质量一直随着勤工俭学的发展而不断上升。
    蚌埠三中高中部和初中部现有普通班二十三个班，学校办工厂以后，工厂又办了学校，招收学生八个班，总计全校共有学生一千七百多人。今年2月初，学校积极开展勤工俭学活动，大办工厂和农场，现在已办起钳工、车工、锻工、翻砂、化工、木工、美工、模型、课本等十三个车间，并且和其他学校合办了一个四百多亩地的红旗农场，在大办钢铁中又积极开展炼铁、炼焦。此外，学生们有时还到工厂做辅助工，搞运输工作。
    学生们一边学习，一边劳动，在生产劳动方面做出很大成绩，教学质量也显著提高。据初步统计，全校学生自暑假以来，已做了八万三千个劳动日，有二百多人学会了犁地、播种，有二百多人学会了翻砂，80％的人学会了炼铁。在各个车间，很多学生已达到三级技工的水平。今年暑期期终考试时，这个学校学生各科学习成绩和1957年下学期相比，初中部总平均成绩提高一三点六分，高中部提高四点六分，全校的成绩提高七点六五分。高三（一）班物理课过去平均成绩只有六十分，今年暑期平均成绩提高到八十二分；化学课过去只有六十八分，今年暑期提高到八十五分。有些学科如地理、历史等，已消灭了不及格现象。语文课提高也很显著，在勤工俭学以前，学生作文时空话连篇，词不达意。教师只是出些“春色满园”之类的题目去描写校园，学生也只能写些春花秋月、毫无内容的文章。勤工俭学以后，学生们的生活丰富了，词汇也丰富了，炼钢铁就写炼钢铁，种地就写种地，内容充实，有血有肉。过去一学期每个学生只写三、五篇文章，还不能按时交作业，今年一个暑假，很多学生在劳动中写了二、三十篇。学生们还写诗，写民歌，写散文，全校从暑假以来共写民歌四万多首。
    蚌埠三中在贯彻党的教育方针时，一开始就非常重视提高教学质量的问题。首先在今年春天，学校就组织全校师生普遍系统地学习了党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，明确了教育与生产劳动相结合的重大意义，并且通过大辩论，使全校师生认识到教育与生产劳动相结合正是为了提高教育质量，使学校能培养出有社会主义觉悟和有文化的劳动者，培养出又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。其次，学校对教学与劳动的时间作了妥善的安排，坚持每周学习四天，劳动两天的制度。各门课程除一部分结合劳动讲授，教学时数略有减少以外，一般的基础课程如语文、数学、物理、化学等教学时数都没有减少。过去每天只上四节到五节课，每周三十学时左右，现在一般每天都上六节课，每周仍有二十五学时左右。第三，采取理论结合实际的教学方法。全校所有教师都分别同有关的车间和农场挂钩，如生物教师同农场和动植物标本车间挂钩，物理教师同钳工、车工车间挂钩。除了课堂教学外，有些课程搬到车间、农场、工地、炼铁炉旁进行教学，有些课程还根据需要搬到校外的工厂、农场、人民公社去上课。如化学课讲到玻璃，就把学生带到玻璃厂去讲课；物理课讲到机械，就把学生带到机械厂去讲课；政治常识课讲到人民公社，就把学生带到人民公 社去一边参观，一边讲课。第四，根据学生的年龄、知识和所学课程的不同情况，具体安排生产劳动，使生产劳动和学习密切结合。如初一、二学习动植物，就参加农业劳动，负责家禽、家畜的饲养，做植物、动物的标本。高中部学生学习生理就分配做生理模型，学习物理的就分配到电工、钳工、车工等车间，学习化学的就分配到化工车间。这样，学生在课堂上学习以后，再经过亲自劳动，一边学一边动手做，就使理论与实际结合起来，学生们学到的各种知识容易巩固。这个学校高三（二）班的学生曹德珍过去地理不及格，以后她参加做地图模型的劳动，通过修模、着色、贴地名，哪里有什么山，哪里有什么水，哪里是什么地方，记得清清楚楚，现在地理成绩很好。她说：“做地图模型以后，我学的地理一辈子也忘不了。”
    蚌埠三中在贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针中，曾经不断地注意开展两条道路的斗争和做好思想教育工作。开始时，有些教师怀疑教育与生产劳动相结合能否提高教育质量，学校党组织就一方面组织全校师生学习有关教育与生产劳动相结合的各种文件，一方面开展大辩论，讲道理，摆事实，驳倒了各种怀疑论调。当党的教育方针开始为大多数师生所接受，并且普遍参加生产劳动以后，学校党组织又及时批判了部分师生中认为只要劳动，不要学习，或者认为要参加生产劳动，就不可能搞好学习的思想。这个学校的党组织认为，党的教育方针的目的是培养有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者，培养又红又专的工人阶级知识分子，逐步消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别。因此，要采取各种方法使教学和生产劳动密切结合起来，使学生们既能广泛地参加生产劳动，提高阶级觉悟和掌握生产知识，又能保证学生们学好基础课程，只有这样，才能正确地贯彻党的教育方针。
