	Export trade is in a slump
	According to "U.S. News & World Report," the total value of U.S. export trade in the first nine months of this year has fallen by an average of 17% compared with last year; the magazine predicts that the export volume will continue to decline in the next six to nine months. In order to save the export trade crisis, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently announced a barter plan to exchange surplus agricultural products such as cotton and tobacco for 26 kinds of raw materials from foreign countries to expand the dumping of surplus agricultural products.
	
	Steel and automobile production show no improvement
	"Steel Age" magazine says that this year's steel production will be the lowest since 1949, and the average annual operating rate is expected to be only 60%. According to figures from the U.S. Department of Commerce, steel production in the first nine months of this year has fallen from 87.7 million tons in the same period last year to 59.07 million tons, a decrease of about 32.6%. It is generally estimated that this year's steel production will be only about 80 million tons. The automobile industry has not improved much, and it is estimated that this year will not exceed 4.5 million vehicles, a decrease of 38% compared with the highest output in 1955.
	
	Unemployment will continue to increase
	Ewan Clague, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor, said that from now until next winter, "employment will drop significantly, and the number of unemployed will increase." According to figures in the November bulletin of the "Federal Reserve Bank," since March of this year, the number of unemployed has consistently accounted for between 6.8% and 7.6% of the total U.S. employment population of more than 60 million. A recent new survey conducted by the Michigan Survey Research Center shows that due to unemployment, the income of nine million American families has been greatly reduced.
	
	National debt hits an unprecedented record
	According to statistics from the U.S. Budget Bureau, in the fiscal year ending June 30 next year, the U.S. government's national debt will reach the astronomical figure of $288 billion, with each American bearing an average of more than $1,590 in government debt. The U.S. Treasury Department is preparing to launch a $5 billion savings bond campaign in early next year to squeeze money from the American people to fill the budget deficit.

    美国经济危机一些情况
    出口贸易一蹶不振
    据“美国新闻与世界报道”报道，今年头九个月美国出口贸易总值平均比去年下跌17％；这家杂志预测在未来半年至九个月内，出口数量仍将继续下降。为了挽救出口贸易危机，美国农业部最近已宣布一项以棉花、烟叶等剩余农产品同外国交换二十六种原料的换货计划，以扩大倾销剩余农产品。
    钢铁和汽车生产无起色
    美国“钢铁时代”杂志说，今年钢产量将是1949年以来最低的数字，全年平均开工率预料只有60％。另据美国商务部数字，今年头九个月的钢产量，已从去年同期的八千七百七十万吨下降到五千九百零七万吨，大约下降了32.6％。一般估计，今年钢产量只有八千万吨左右。汽车工业没有多大起色，估计今年不会超出四百五十万辆，比产量最高的1955年，下降了38％。
    失业还将增加
    美国劳工部劳工统计局局长尤·克拉格说，从现在起直到明冬，“就业人数将大大下降，失业人数将增加”。据“联邦储备银行”11月份公报的数字，从今年3月以来，失业人数始终占美国六千多万就业人口总数6.8％至7.6％之间。密执安调查研究中心最近进行一次新调查表明，由于失业，九百万个美国家庭收入大为减少。
    国债创空前纪录
    据美国预算局统计，到明年6月30日为止的财政年度中，美国政府的国债将达二千八百八十亿美元的天文数字，平均每一个美国人要负担一千五百九十多美元的政府债务。美国财政部准备在明年初展开一项推销五十亿美元储蓄券运动，在美国人民身上挤出一笔钱来填补预算赤字。
