Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Performing Arts Troupe gave a report-back performance to the people of the capital in Tiananmen Square this morning. More than 20,000 spectators watched the fourteen song, dance, and folk art programs they performed. These programs portrayed the heroic image of the Volunteer Army and the profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. Every program was warmly welcomed by the audience.

At the end of the performance, the audience surrounded the performers and applauded for a long time, reluctant to leave. All the performers walked off the stage and shook hands with the audience. Some Young Pioneers took off their red scarves, some university students removed their labor-defense system medals, and some government cadres took out small notebooks from their pockets and gave them to the members of the performing arts troupe to express their respect and love for the victorious Volunteer Army returning home.
