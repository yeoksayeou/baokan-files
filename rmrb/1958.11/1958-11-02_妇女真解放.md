    Women's True Liberation
    In the grain processing factory, the machines hum loudly.
    Everyone goes to the canteen, the meals are prepared and ready.
    Sewing is done by specialists.
    Large bathhouses are provided for bathing.
    Children are sent to kindergartens, playing in groups and singing in unison.
    Realizing the collectivization of life, achieving women's true liberation.
    True liberation, gaining freedom, no longer confined to the stone mills,
    No longer stuck by the stoves and beds, able to soar freely like seagulls.
    Participating in the Great Leap Forward in production, sweat all shed for the public,
    Rushing wherever there's a need for a concentrated effort, women are equally not lagging behind.
    Red and expert schools, militia teams, all kinds of factories can be joined,
    Not needing three or five years, everyone will become multi-skilled.
    Can women's lofty aspirations not match men's?
    From now on, we will see each and every one achieve greatness!

    妇女真解放
    叶圣陶粮食加工厂，机声隆隆响。大伙进食堂，饭菜做停当。缝纫有专工。洗澡设大汤。孩子送进幼儿园，成群玩儿齐声唱。实现生活集体化，获致妇女真解放。真解放，得自由，再不困在碾台磨台旁，再不守在锅台炕台头，尽可任意翱翔像海鸥。参加生产大跃进，汗水全为公众流，哪儿突击往哪儿，妇女同样不落后。红专校，民兵队，种种工厂也可投，不须三年或五载，个个皆成多面手。妇女壮志宁不逮男儿？从今将见各各有千秋！
