Sister and Brother Blood
朝鲜 Li Yuzi

In May 1952, I was a nurse in the People's Army 71st Hospital. At that time, our hospital was stationed in Malhui-ri, Huaiyang County, Gangwon Province, very close to the front lines. Many wounded soldiers were sent to our hospital. Sometimes, we nurses would even cross the steep mountains of the Kumgang Mountains to pick up the wounded directly from the front lines.

One day, our hospital suddenly received a young Volunteer Army soldier who was seriously injured. His face was pale, he was unconscious, and he kept muttering, but none of us could understand what he was saying. It seemed that his life was in grave danger.

The military doctor told us: "He needs a blood transfusion immediately!" It was our combat mission as nurses to be ready to give blood transfusions to seriously wounded soldiers at any time. However, we had already given blood to many wounded soldiers, and coupled with the tireless nursing work day and night, all of our comrades' bodies had become extremely weak. But, how could we stand idly by when we saw the young Volunteer Army soldier unconscious, even in danger of losing his life! He was the outstanding son of the Chinese people who used their blood to help us. Today he was wounded, just like our own younger brother was wounded. So we were all heartbroken and shed tears, and we all rushed to the injection room to demand to give him a blood transfusion.

That time, I had the honor of giving him blood. Although I didn't give much blood, my blood finally flowed together with his. A few hours after the transfusion, I went to the ward and was delighted to see that he had opened his eyes! He looked around, and then looked at me for a long time. As if he realized everything after his injury, he gestured for clothes. I immediately brought him his military uniform. He took out a pen from his uniform and wrote the words "brothers" in my palm, and then wrote his name: "Xie Ping." At that time, I was truly infinitely happy for his escape from danger. Afterwards, we quickly became familiar, as close as siblings.

One day, more than a month after he was hospitalized, I went to the front lines with my comrades as usual to carry stretchers. When crossing Tiehling, we were suddenly bombed by enemy planes. I was unfortunately injured in the right chest, and the injury was also very serious. Comrade Xie Ping's body had not yet recovered at that time, but at his firm request, his blood was transfused into my veins again. From then on, our blood mingled once again, our lives, youth, and future were linked together once again, and we used blood to form a true sibling relationship...

One day, the military doctor told me: "Comrade Xie Ping can walk now!" I was very happy to hear that, and thought: "When can I get out of bed and walk? When that time comes, I must immediately run to my dear brother, hold hands, and walk together!" However, my wish did not come true. The next day, I was transferred to a rear hospital and separated from Comrade Xie Ping. I remember that at the time of parting, Comrade Xie Ping came to my bedside with a cane, supported by a nurse. With infinite reluctance, he called me "sister," and gave me a photo as a souvenir. Not long after I left the hospital, I heard that he was also transferred to a Volunteer Army hospital.

To this day, I still regret that we don't know each other's mailing addresses. In order to find Comrade Xie Ping, whenever I see the figure of a passing Volunteer Army comrade, I suspect that he is Comrade Xie Ping, but after I run up to take a closer look, it is not. Because of this, I have shed countless tears sadly. Because my blood is still flowing in Comrade Xie Ping's veins, and Comrade Xie Ping's blood is also flowing in my veins. How can I forget this kind of sibling friendship formed with blood! (Attached picture)

    姊弟血
    朝鲜  李玉子
    1952年5月，我在人民军七一医院当护士。那时，我们的医院驻在江原道淮阳郡末辉里，和前线相隔很近，很多伤员都送到我们医院里来。有时候，我们护士们还越过金刚山的峻岭，直接到前沿阵地去接运伤员。
    有一天，我们医院里忽然送来了一位年轻的志愿军伤员。他的伤势很严重，脸色惨白，昏迷不醒，嘴里呓语不休，但我们谁也听不懂他在说些什么。看来，他的生命正处于很危险的境地。
    军医同志对我们说：“需要马上给他输血！”本来，随时准备给重伤员输血，在那时是我们护士们的战斗任务。可是，我们已经给许多伤员输过血，再加上日夜不停的护理工作，我们所有同志的身体都已经弄得极其衰弱了。但是，我们眼看着年轻的志愿军伤员不省人事，甚至还有生命的危险，又怎能袖手旁观呢！他是用鲜血援助我们的中国人民的优秀的儿子，今天他负了伤，就和我们的亲弟弟负了伤一样。所以我们心里都难过得流出了眼泪，大家一起到注射室里去争着要求给他输血。
    那一次，我光荣地给他输了血，虽然输的血不多，但是我的血终于和他的血流在一起了。在输过血几个钟头以后，我去病房里一看，使人高兴的是：他已睁开眼睛了！他望望周围，又看了我好久，好像他意识到他伤后的一切，便打着手势要衣服。我马上把他的军装给他送过去。他在自己军服里拿出钢笔来，在我的手心里写了“兄弟”两个字，接着又写了他自己的名字：“谢平”。当时我真为他的脱险感到无限高兴。以后，我们很快地就熟悉起来了，像姐弟一样的亲密。
    在他住院一个多月后的一天，我照常和同志们一同到前沿阵地去抬担架。越过铁岭的时候，突然遭到了敌机的轰炸，我的右胸部不幸受伤，伤势也很重。谢平同志的身体那时还没有痊愈，但在他的坚决要求下，又把他的血输进了我的血管里。从此，我们的鲜血又一次地交融了，我们的生命、青春和未来又一次地联系在一起了，我们用鲜血结成了真正的姊弟……。
    有一天，军医告诉我说：“谢平同志现在可以走路啦！”我听了很高兴，心想：“什么时候我也可以下床走路呢？到那时，我一定马上跑到我的亲弟弟面前去，手拉手地在一起散步！”可是，我的愿望并没有实现。第二天，我被转运到后方医院去，就和谢平同志分手了。记得，在临别的时候，谢平同志拄着拐杖，在护士的搀扶下来到我的床前。他怀着无限惜别的心情，叫了我一声“姐姐”，便拿出一张照片赠给我留念。我离开医院以后不久，听说他也被转送到志愿军医院去了。
    至今我都感到遗憾的是：我们互相不知道通信地址。我为了找谢平同志，每当看见一个过路的志愿军同志的身影，都疑惑他就是谢平同志，但等我跑到跟前仔细地看看之后，却又不是。为此，我曾难过地流过无数次的眼泪。因为，我的血现在还在谢平同志血管里流，而谢平同志的血也在我的血管里流。这种以鲜血结成的姊弟情谊，怎能使我忘记呢！（附图片）
