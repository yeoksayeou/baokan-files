    Korean Government Issues Statement Pointing Out
    Without the Participation of Representatives of the Korean People
    The United Nations Has No Right to Discuss the Korean Question
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 6th: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today regarding the United Nations' refusal, under the manipulation of the United States, to allow representatives of the DPRK government to participate in the current UN General Assembly's discussion on the Korean question. The statement declared that it would not recognize any resolution on the Korean question unilaterally adopted by the United Nations in the absence of representatives of the DPRK government, in violation of the will and interests of the Korean people.
    The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as a party concerned in the Korean question, has the legitimate right to send its representatives to participate in all discussions concerning the interests of the Korean people. Precisely for this reason, the Soviet delegation's proposal to support Foreign Minister Nam Il's letter of September 24 requesting participation in the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the Korean question, and inviting representatives of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the United Nations General Assembly's discussion, received the support of representatives of many countries. However, in pursuit of its aims to invade Korea, the US imperialists, who manipulate the United Nations, have once again set their voting machine in motion, causing the United Nations to pass an illegitimate "resolution" refusing representatives of the DPRK government to participate in the discussion on the Korean question. As a result, the current UN General Assembly is illegally discussing the Korean question in the absence of the true representatives of the Korean people.
    The statement said that refusing representatives of the DPRK government to participate in the discussion on the Korean question is a serious violation of the interests and rights of the Korean people, and is an illegitimate measure that crudely tramples upon the various provisions of the United Nations Charter and the various principles recognized by international law. Therefore, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people resolutely oppose this illegitimate resolution passed by the United Nations Political Committee under the pressure of the US imperialists.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: On the morning of November 5th, the UN General Assembly Political Committee voted on the question of inviting representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea to participate in the discussion of the Korean question. The Soviet proposal suggested inviting representatives from both Koreas. The US proposal suggested only inviting representatives of the Syngman Rhee regime. The Indian delegation proposed an amendment to the US proposal, suggesting also inviting the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Under US manipulation, the Soviet proposal and the Indian amendment to the US proposal were both rejected, and the US proposal was passed by a majority vote.

    朝鲜政府发表声明指出
    没有朝鲜人民的代表参加
    联合国无权讨论朝鲜问题
    新华社平壤6日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人今天就联合国在美国操纵下拒绝共和国政府代表参加本届联大关于朝鲜问题的讨论一事发表声明，表示将不承认联合国在没有共和国政府代表参加的情况下，违背朝鲜人民的意志和利益，片面地通过的关于朝鲜问题的任何决议。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府是具有合法权利派自己的代表参加一切有关朝鲜人民利益问题的讨论朝鲜问题的当事者。正因为如此，苏联代表团关于支持南日外务相9月24日关于要求参加联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题的信件，邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表参加联合国大会的讨论的提案，受到了许多国家代表的支持。但是，为了追求侵略朝鲜的目的，操纵着联合国的美帝国主义者这次又开动它的表决机器，使联合国通过了拒绝共和国政府代表参加关于朝鲜问题讨论的不正当的“决议”。结果，本届联大就在没有朝鲜人民的真正代表参加的情况下非法讨论朝鲜问题。
    声明说，拒绝共和国政府代表参加朝鲜问题的讨论，是严重侵犯朝鲜人民的利益和权利，并且是粗暴地蹂躏联合国宪章的各项规定和国际法所公认的各项原则的不正当的措施。因此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民坚决反对联合国政治委员会在美帝国主义者的压力下所通过的这种不正当的决议。
    据新华社7日讯　5日上午联大政治委员会就关于邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜的代表参加讨论朝鲜问题这一问题进行表决。苏联提案建议邀请两个朝鲜的代表。美国提案建议只邀请李承晚政权的代表。印度代表团对美国提案提出了一项修正案，建议也邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。在美国操纵下，苏联提案以及印度对美国提案的修正案都遭到否决，美国提案以多数票通过。
