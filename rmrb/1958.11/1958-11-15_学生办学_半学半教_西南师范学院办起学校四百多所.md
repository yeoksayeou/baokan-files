Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 14th: Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the students of Southwest Normal College are implementing a half-study, half-teach system. Since August of this year, they have independently established and assisted relevant departments in establishing more than 400 schools. These schools include nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools, and even universities. The forms of schooling include part-work, part-study schools, as well as spare-time night schools, correspondence courses, single-subject training classes, and bi-daily, tri-daily, and Sunday systems. Tens of thousands of workers, farmers, and street residents have been organized to enroll. At the same time, the college has also opened lectures on family education and nine teacher tutoring stations. Nearly a thousand students have participated in literacy campaigns, and more than a hundred students have gone to rural areas to investigate the situation of rural schools. In this way, an educational network centered on the normal college has been initially formed. More than 50% of the students in the college have participated in school-running work.

In running schools, they have adhered to the direction of opening the doors to workers and peasants. Students from worker and peasant backgrounds account for 85% of the total number of students in all schools run by the college. They went to rural areas, factories, and streets to mobilize households one by one, bringing culture to their doorsteps and setting up schools in factories, people's communes, and streets. If there were no classrooms, they borrowed rooms in restaurants, hotels, and open spaces; if there were no teaching aids, they made them themselves or pooled money to buy chalk and brushes. In the selection and compilation of teaching materials, the students paid attention to both meeting the urgent needs of the workers and peasants and helping them improve their theoretical knowledge. Therefore, the students visited workers and peasants in advance, lived and worked with them, and then compiled teaching materials and reformed teaching methods in light of the characteristics of the workers and peasants and their actual needs. They compiled more than a hundred kinds of textbooks, lecture notes, and teaching outlines that were welcomed by workers and peasants.

In the past, after the students of this college entered the school, they spent more than three and a half years studying behind closed doors in the school for four years; although they had been studying educational courses such as psychology, education, and teaching methods every year since the first grade, the internship process was less than three months, and coupled with the serious bourgeois teaching views of some teachers and the detachment of some teaching materials from reality, the knowledge students learned was easily forgotten and difficult to consolidate. When the fourth-year students of the Chinese Department first participated in school management, more than half of the students did not know how to write lesson plans. But after running schools on a large scale and learning and teaching at the same time, it was very different. Now, they can not only compile their own lesson plans and teaching materials, but also many students can teach two or more subjects. Now, through the exercise of running schools, students can not only teach ordinary middle schools and secondary normal schools, but also teach students in various types of schools such as industrial and agricultural middle schools. Students also launched mass scientific research on the problems they found in their teaching, such as "How do private nurseries implement full-time care" and "How do township and commune party committees lead and manage private middle schools," and wrote more than 500 valuable and practical academic papers.

Some students who were not very comfortable studying at the normal college in the past, personally experienced in the practice of running schools that the education cause is a part of the Party's cause, and understood the importance of cultivating "people," which greatly consolidated their professional thinking. Many students in the Chinese, Chemistry, Education and other departments went to agricultural middle schools dozens of miles away to teach classes every Saturday, rain or shine, and often did not return to school until late at night. While running schools in factories and rural areas, students also took time to participate in labor production, and the relationship between students and workers and peasants became closer. When there was a drought and a lack of labor in rural areas, the students went to support them; when the school ran factories and farms, the workers and peasants also sent their best experts to guide them. College students no longer felt that workers and peasants were stupid and rude, and workers and peasants no longer regarded college students as outsiders.

This mass school-running movement has made professors and lecturers who doubted the Party's education policy and school-running policy admit the correctness and greatness of the Party's policy in the face of facts, and have to express their willingness to learn from the masses. Many teachers also participated in teaching at Red and Expert Universities and investigated the situation and problems of private middle schools with the students. After many teachers realized the seriousness of the separation of theory from practice from the facts, they expressed their willingness to put down their airs and go to practice to find treasures.

### 学生办学　半学半教  西南师范学院办起学校四百多所

    学生办学　半学半教
    西南师范学院办起学校四百多所
    新华社重庆14日电　西南师范学院的学生们在党委领导下，实行半学半教，从今年8月份以来自办和协助有关部门办起了四百多所学校。这些学校包括托儿所、幼儿园、小学、中学，一直到大学。学校的形式有半工半读，有业余性质的夜校、函授班、单科性训练班及间日制、三日制、星期日制等多种多样，组织了数以万计的职工、农民和街道居民入学。同时，这个学院还开办了家庭教育讲座和九所教师辅导站，近千名学生参加了扫盲，并且有一百多名学生到农村去调查研究农村办学情况。这样，一个以师范学院为中心的教育网初步形成。全院50％以上的学生参加了办学工作。
    在办学中，他们坚持了向工农开门的方向，全院所办的学校工农成分的学生占总数85％。他们到农村、工厂、街道去挨家挨户动员，把文化送上门，把学校办到工厂、人民公社和街道。没有课堂，就借餐厅、旅馆的房子和空地；没有教具就自己动手制作，或凑钱去买粉笔、刷子。在教材的选择和编写上，学生们都注意既适合工、农群众的迫切需要，又能帮助他们提高理论知识。因此学生们都事先访问工农群众，和工农同住同劳动，然后结合工农特点针对实际需要编写教材、改革教学。他们自己编写了百种以上受工人、农民欢迎的课本、讲义和教学大纲。
    过去，这个学院的学生进校以后，四年内在学校闭门学习的时间就有三年半以上；虽然过去从一年级开始，每年都要学习心理学、教育学、教学法等教育课程，但实习过程不到三个月，加上部分教师资产阶级教学观点严重和一些教材的脱离实际，学生们学到的知识随学随忘不易巩固。中文系四年级学生刚开始参加办学时，有一半以上的学生不知如何写教案。可是通过大办学校、边学边教以后就大不相同了。现在，他们不仅自己会编教案、教材，同时不少学生还可以教两门或两门以上的课。现在，学生们通过办学的锻炼，不但能教一般的中学和中等师范学校，并且能教工、农业中学等各式各样学校的学生。学生们还根据自己教学中发现的问题如“民办托儿所如何实行全托制”、“乡社党委如何领导和管理民办中学”等展开了群众性的科学研究，并写出了有价值又结合实际的学术论文五百多篇。
    一些过去不太安心在师范学院学习的学生，在办学实践中切身体会到了教育事业是党的事业的一部分，懂得了培养“人”的工作的重要性，大大巩固了专业思想。中文、化学、教育等系的许多学生，每个星期六不分天晴下雨都摸黑到几十里地以外的农业中学去教课，常常是深夜才回学校。学生们在工厂农村办学的同时，还抽空参加劳动生产，学生和工农的关系进一步密切起来。天旱农村缺乏劳动力的时候，学生们就去支援；学校办工厂、农场的时候，工人、农民也派出自己最好的能手去指导。大学生不再觉得工人、农民又笨又粗，工人、农民也不再把大学生当外人了。
    这个群众性的办学运动，使过去怀疑党的教育方针和办学方针的教授、讲师，在事实面前不得不承认党的方针的正确、伟大，不得不表示愿意向群众学习。不少教师还参加红专大学授课，和学生一起调查研究民办中学的情况、问题。不少教师从事实中认识到理论脱离实际的严重性后，表示愿意放下架子，到实际中去寻珠取宝。（附图片）
