    Transforming Gifts into Products
  　Huagong
    Zheng Fu used indigenous methods for hot rolling gears, conquering a world-class new technology fortress. This is a very valuable creation. However, how to rapidly and universally promote a new technological creation is a problem worth noting.
    Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Party, workers and masses in various regions have been vigorously engaged in technological revolution, and many new creations, inventions, and products have emerged. Some have already been mass-produced to meet social needs. But there are also some products that, after being created, remain in the "gift" stage. How to "transform gifts into products" has not been well addressed in many production departments. One of the important reasons is that some production departments have not completely broken free from the blind faith in planned balance. They are afraid to resolutely adjust established production plans and order, and to resolutely support new things. This causes the flowers of the technological revolution to stagnate at the stage of successful trial production, and they cannot be applied and promoted in a timely manner.
    Any new technology that can improve labor productivity, when applied to production, will inevitably disrupt the original production plan, scheduling plan, material allocation plan, etc., to varying degrees. This is a normal phenomenon and nothing to be afraid of. For example, many machine tool factories are currently manufacturing a large number of gear cutting machine tools, and the task is indeed very heavy. But if the production plan is adjusted and the manufacturing task of hot-rolled gear equipment is included, one set of hot-rolling equipment can replace eighty to one hundred gear cutting machine tools. Therefore, if disrupting the original low-yield plan is exchanged for high-yield results, what could be better?
    It should be seen that allowing various inventions and creations to be long treated as gifts at exhibitions not only damages production but also hinders the further development of the mass technological revolution movement. It can be seen that transforming gifts into products and ensuring that the creations of the masses are quickly applied to production is not only a technical organizational work but also a political task that cannot be ignored.

    化礼品为产品
  　华工
    郑富有用土法热轧齿轮，攻下了世界新技术堡垒。这是一个很有价值的创造。但是，一项新的技术创造出来以后，如何迅速地普遍推广，却是一个值得注意的问题。
    今年以来，各地工人群众在党的领导下大搞技术革命，曾经出现了不少的新创造、新发明和新产品。有的已经大量生产，满足了社会需要。但也有一些产品创制以后还停留在礼品阶段。怎样“变礼品为产品”，在不少生产部门中还没有很好注意解决。其中重要原因之一，是有些生产部门对计划平衡的迷信没有完全打破。他们不敢坚决调整既定的生产计划与秩序，坚决支持新生事物。这样，就使技术革命的花朵停滞在试制成功的阶段，而得不到及时应用和推广。
    任何一件能够提高劳动生产率的新技术，运用到生产中去，必然会程度不等地打破原来的生产计划、调度计划、物资分配计划等等。这是正常现象，毫不可怕。譬如，目前有不少机械制造厂正在制造大批切削齿轮的机床，任务的确十分繁重。但如果把生产计划调整一下，将热轧齿轮设备的制造任务排进去，则一套热轧设备就可代替八十台到一百台切削齿轮的机床，试问打乱了原来的低产计划换来了高产果实，这又何乐而不为呢？
    应该看到，让各种创造发明长期当做展览会上的礼品，不但使生产受到损失，还将阻碍群众性技术革命运动的进一步开展。由此可见，变礼品为产品，保证群众的创造迅速应用到生产中去，不仅是个技术性的组织工作，也是一件不可忽视的政治任务。
