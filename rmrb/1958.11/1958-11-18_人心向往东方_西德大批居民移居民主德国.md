People's Hearts Turn Towards the East
Large Numbers of West German Residents Migrate to Democratic Germany

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th. According to the "Neues Deutschland" newspaper, with the further decline of the West German economy, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed has greatly increased, and militarization has intensified. In recent months, many West German working people have moved to Democratic Germany to live. This trend is growing stronger.

Among the immigrants from West Germany are a large number of miners, smelter workers, textile workers, and many technicians from other industrial sectors. A significant proportion are also young men of conscription age who have fled to Democratic Germany to engage in peaceful labor, unwilling to serve in the West German army.

In order to better receive these compatriots from West Germany, the government of Democratic Germany has established five temporary reception stations along the border between East and West Germany. After a short stay at the stations, immigrants can go to their work posts and start a new life.

This growing wave of migration to Democratic Germany has alarmed the West German ruling group. West German military police have recently stepped up search measures at border stations leading to Democratic Germany and have unreasonably arrested a large number of people they consider suspected of immigrating. As a result, many West German immigrants have to risk crossing the border at night.

Reports say that the Schleswig-Holstein state government in West Germany recently ordered increased vigilance on the border with Democratic Germany in the state and deployed additional border police units and outposts on all roads leading to the border.

    人心向往东方
    西德大批居民移居民主德国
    新华社柏林15日电　据“新德意志报”报道，随着西德经济的进一步衰退，失业和半失业人数大大增加以及军国主义化的加紧，近几个月来许多西德劳动人民纷纷迁来民主德国生活。这种潮流有越来越壮大的趋势。
    在从西德迁来的移民中有大批矿工、冶炼工人、纺织工人和不少其他工业部门的技术人员。由于不愿到西德军队中当兵而逃来民主德国从事和平劳动的适龄青年也占很大的比例。
    为了更好地接待这批来自西德的同胞，民主德国政府已经沿着东西德边界设立了五处临时收容站。移民们在站上稍事逗留之后便可以分头前往工作岗位开始新生活。
    这股声势日益浩大的迁居民主德国的浪潮使西德统治集团感到惊慌。西德军警近来在通往民主德国的各边境车站上加紧搜查措施，并且无理逮捕大批被他们认为有移居嫌疑的人。不少西德移民因此不得不冒着危险，黑夜偷越边境。
    有消息说，西德石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州政府最近下令在该州同民主德国毗邻的边境上加强警戒，并且在所有通向边界的公路上增派边防警察部队和岗哨。
