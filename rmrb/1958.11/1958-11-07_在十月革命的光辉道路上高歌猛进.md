    Today is the forty-first anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. The Chinese people, with boundless joy, join the fraternal Soviet people, the people of the socialist camp, the working people of the world, and all progressive mankind in celebrating this great and glorious festival.
    The great October Socialist Revolution began a new era in human history, the transition from capitalism to socialism. In the forty-one years since the October Revolution, a sharp and repeated struggle has unfolded between the nascent socialist revolutionary forces and the national revolutionary forces supported by socialism, and the decaying imperialist forces. The history of the past forty-one years is a history of the struggle between nascent forces and decaying forces. The historical development of the past forty-one years shows that the nascent socialist forces will surely defeat the decaying imperialist forces.
    Forty-one years ago, in the sound of the October Revolution's cannons, a socialist spring was born in human history. Socialism changed from an ideal into reality, taking root in one-sixth of the world's land. From that time on, the socialist forces, with their inexhaustible youthful vitality, have broken through brambles, sailed against the wind, and advanced forward. Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the great Soviet people built socialism in a short historical period; crushed the frenzied attacks of Hitlerite fascism, and defended world peace and the cause of human progress. After the Second World War, a series of socialist countries emerged in Europe and Asia. The situation in which the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, was like an isolated island surrounded by a capitalist ocean no longer existed. A powerful socialist system centered on the Soviet Union has taken shape. Now, this powerful new world system spans Europe and Asia, occupies more than a quarter of the world's territory, accounts for more than a third of the world's population, and its total industrial output accounts for about two-fifths of the world's total. The countries of the socialist camp have established a new type of fraternal relationship in accordance with the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. They are closely united in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, supporting each other, encouraging each other, and moving forward hand in hand.
    After the victory of the October Revolution, under the impact of the socialist movement and the national independence movement, imperialism increasingly moved towards decline and death. Especially since the Second World War, socialist revolutions and national revolutionary movements have surged, and the people's movements for peace and democracy in various countries have risen like waves, strongly shaking the foundations of imperialism. People can see that in the twelve years from the end of the First World War to the outbreak of the Second World War, the capitalist world still experienced temporary and relative stability, and the colonial system was still basically kept intact. In the more than ten years since the Second World War, the situation has been completely different. The political, economic, and revolutionary crises of the capitalist world have intensified in the postwar years. A relatively stable situation no longer appears. Colonies and semi-colonies are no longer the rear of imperialism. The old world is disintegrating internally. Imperialism's lifespan will not be long.
    In the past year, the great Soviet people have made tremendous achievements in communist construction. The reorganization of industry and construction implemented last year and the reorganization of machine tractor stations implemented this year have greatly accelerated the pace of Soviet construction. In the first half of this year, compared with the same period last year, Soviet industrial output increased by 10.5%, while the United States decreased by 10.8%. At present, the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in terms of the average annual increase in the absolute quantity of important industrial products such as pig iron, steel, iron ore, coal, oil, cement, and wool fabrics, and is striving to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita output in the shortest possible time. This year, Soviet agriculture has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The Soviet Union continues to leap forward in science and technology. To this day, the Soviet Union's third large satellite is still operating in the air; this year, the Soviet Union has achieved new achievements in the study of the peaceful use of thermonuclear reactions and in mastering rocket technology and aviation technology. The magnificent seven-year plan that the Soviet Union is currently drafting will be a decisive step in surpassing the United States in the peaceful competition, and will be a brilliant and magnificent picture of moving towards communism. The brilliant achievements of Soviet communist construction have greatly strengthened the power of the socialist camp and inspired the working people of the world to yearn for it.
    In the past year, the powerful Soviet Union has played an outstanding role in maintaining peace and preventing imperialist aggression. The Soviet Union has made a series of efforts to strive for consultations among major powers to resolve important international issues, reduce armaments, and stop nuclear weapons testing. The Soviet Union firmly opposed the US-British imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and firmly defended the independence of the new-born Republic of Iraq. It is precisely because of the Arab people's resolute struggle, and because of the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace forces of the world for the Arab national independence movement, that the US-British imperialist aggression against the Middle East finally suffered a shameful defeat. The Soviet Union firmly supports the Chinese people's just struggle to defend their homeland's territory, and strongly condemns the US imperialist military provocations and war threats in the Taiwan Strait area. The Soviet government has repeatedly warned US imperialism that infringing upon China is infringing upon the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union recently granted the United Arab Republic and Argentina huge preferential loans, which is a sincere assistance to the development of national economies in economically underdeveloped countries. The facts of the past year have once again proved that the Soviet Union is a strong fortress of world peace, a strong pillar of national independence movements, and the most loyal friend of the people of all countries striving for peace.
    The fraternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has been further strengthened. In the past year, all aspects of China's socialist construction have been leaping forward. This year, China's total grain output will reach more than 700 billion catties, and steel production will definitely double; cultural revolution and technological revolution are developing extensively. The achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction are inseparable from the great and selfless assistance of the fraternal Soviet people. It is particularly worth mentioning the meeting between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev in Beijing. The meeting between the Chinese and Soviet leaders marked a new stage in the friendly unity between our two countries. As Comrade Khrushchev said not long ago: "The friendship between the Soviet Union and China is now more solid than ever." The powerful development of the strength of China and the Soviet Union, and the further strengthening and consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship, are undoubtedly an important guarantee for maintaining world peace.
    A year ago, representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties from various countries gathered in Moscow to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, and then held the Moscow Conference, which adopted a historically significant declaration. This series of activities embodied the great international solidarity of the communist movement centered on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In the year since then, the communists of socialist countries and the communists of all countries in the world have been tempered in the struggle to criticize the Yugoslav modern revisionism serving imperialism. This struggle resolutely defended the purity of Marxism-Leninism, greatly enhanced the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary ranks, and further consolidated the unity of the socialist camp. In this way, better conditions have been prepared for the development of the international communist movement and the maintenance of world peace.
    The results of the struggle between the nascent socialist forces and the decadent imperialist forces over the past forty-one years have fully proved Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant thesis that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." The development of the situation in the future will inevitably prove this more powerfully. The East, represented by socialism and the national revolutionary movement, is a rising new world, while the West, represented by imperialism and colonialism, is a setting old world. The new world will surely replace the old world. This is the direction of historical development, and it is also the direction pointed out by the October Revolution, which cannot be stopped by any force. The people of socialist countries and the working people of the world will march forward triumphantly on the brilliant path of the October Revolution.

    在十月革命的光辉道路上高歌猛进
    今天是伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年。中国人民以无限欢欣的心情，同兄弟般的苏联人民，同社会主义阵营各国人民，同全世界劳动人民以及全体进步人类一起，共同庆祝这个伟大的光辉的节日。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，开始了人类由资本主义过渡到社会主义的新时代。十月革命以来的四十一年，新生的社会主义革命力量和为社会主义所支持的民族革命力量同腐朽的帝国主义力量之间，展开了尖锐的、反复的斗争。四十一年来的历史，就是一部新生力量同腐朽力量的斗争史。四十一年来的历史发展表明，新生的社会主义力量一定能够战胜腐朽的帝国主义力量。
    四十一年前，在十月革命的炮声中，人类历史上诞生了一个社会主义的春天。社会主义从理想变成了现实，在世界六分之一土地上扎下了根。从那时候起，社会主义力量就以其无穷无尽的青春活力，披荆斩棘，乘风破浪，向前迈进。伟大的苏联人民，在光荣的苏联共产党的领导下，在短短的历史时期内建成了社会主义；粉碎了希特勒法西斯的疯狂进攻，捍卫了世界和平和人类进步事业。第二次世界大战以后，欧亚两洲出现了一系列的社会主义国家，第一个社会主义国家苏联像孤岛般处在资本主义海洋包围中的那种形势不复存在了，一个以苏联为中心的强大的社会主义体系形成了。现在，这个强大的新的世界体系，横跨欧亚两大洲，领土占全世界的四分之一以上，人口占全世界的三分之一以上，工业总产量约占全世界的五分之二。社会主义阵营各国，按照马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则，建立了新型的兄弟关系。它们紧密团结在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中，彼此支援，互相鼓舞，携手并进。
    十月革命胜利后，在社会主义运动和民族独立运动这两种力量的冲击之下，帝国主义日益走向没落和死亡。特别是第二次世界大战以后，社会主义革命和民族革命运动风起云涌，各国人民争取和平和民主的运动如浪似潮，强烈地震撼着帝国主义的根基。人们可以看到，从第一次世界大战结束到第二次世界大战爆发的十二年间，资本主义世界还有过暂时的、相对的稳定，殖民体系还基本上完整地被保持着。第二次世界大战以后的十多年间，情况完全不同了。资本主义世界的政治危机、经济危机和革命危机，在战后年代里愈演愈烈。相对稳定的局面不再出现了。殖民地和半殖民地不再成为帝国主义的后方了。旧世界内部分崩离析。帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。
    这一年来，伟大的苏联人民在共产主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。去年实行的工业和建筑业的改组和今年实行的机器拖拉机站的改组，大大加快了苏联建设的速度。今年上半年与去年同期比较，苏联工业产量增加了10.5％，而美国却下降了10.8％。目前，苏联不论在生铁、钢、铁矿砂、煤、石油、水泥、毛织品等重要工业品的每年平均增产的绝对数量上都已超过美国，并争取最短的时期内按人口平均产量方面赶上和超过美国。今年苏联的农业获得了空前的大丰收。苏联在科学和技术方面继续跃进。至今苏联第三颗大卫星还在空中运转；苏联今年在研究和平利用热核反应方面，在掌握火箭技术和航空技术方面都取得了新的成就。最近苏联正在拟订的规模宏伟的七年计划，将是在和平竞赛中超过美国的一个决定性步骤，将是向共产主义迈进的一幅光辉灿烂的图景。苏联共产主义建设的辉煌成就，大大加强了社会主义阵营的威力，使全世界劳动人民为之鼓舞向往。
    这一年来，强大的苏联在维护和平、制止帝国主义侵略方面发挥了卓越的作用。苏联在争取大国协商解决重要国际问题、裁减军备和停止试验核武器等方面作了一系列的努力。苏联坚决反对美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，坚决维护新生的伊拉克共和国的独立。正是由于阿拉伯人民的坚决斗争，由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界和平力量对阿拉伯民族独立运动的支持，美英帝国主义对中东的侵略终于遭到可耻的失败。苏联坚决支持中国人民保卫祖国领土的正义斗争，严厉谴责美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅和战争威胁。苏联政府一再警告美帝国主义，侵犯中国就是侵犯苏联。苏联最近给予阿拉伯联合共和国和阿根廷以巨额的优惠贷款，这是对经济不发达国家发展民族经济的真诚援助。过去一年来的事实再一次证明，苏联是世界和平的坚强堡垒，是民族独立运动的强大支柱，是争取和平的各国人民的最忠实的朋友。
    中苏两国人民兄弟般的、牢不可破的友谊进一步地加强了。过去一年中，我国社会主义建设的各方面都在大跃进。今年我国粮食总产量达到七千亿斤以上，钢产量肯定地要翻一番；文化革命和技术革命正在广泛发展。我国人民在社会主义建设中的成就，是同兄弟般的苏联人民的伟大无私的援助分不开的。特别值得提起的是，毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志在北京举行的会谈。中苏领导人的会谈标志着两国友好团结的新阶段。正如赫鲁晓夫同志不久前所说的：“苏联和中国的友谊现在比任何时候都巩固。”中苏两国力量的强大发展，中苏友谊的进一步加强和巩固，无疑地是维护世界和平的重要保证。
    一年以前，各国共产党和工人党的代表云集莫斯科庆祝十月革命四十周年，并且接着举行了莫斯科会议，通过了有历史意义的宣言。这一系列的活动体现了以苏联共产党为中心的共产主义运动的伟大的国际团结。一年以来，社会主义阵营各国共产党人和世界各国共产党人，都在批判为帝国主义服务的南斯拉夫现代修正主义的斗争中得到了锻炼。这一斗争坚决地捍卫了马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，大大地增强了革命队伍的战斗力，进一步巩固了社会主义阵营的团结。这样，就为发展国际共产主义运动和维护世界和平事业准备了更好的条件。
    过去四十一年间，新生的社会主义力量和腐朽的帝国主义力量斗争的结果，充分证明了毛泽东同志关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断。今后形势的发展必然将更加有力地证明这一点。社会主义和民族革命运动的东方代表方兴未艾的新世界，帝国主义和殖民主义的西方代表夕阳残照的旧世界。新世界一定代替旧世界。这是历史发展的方向，也是十月革命所指出的方向，是任何力量所不能阻挡的。社会主义各国人民和全世界劳动人民将在十月革命的光辉道路上高歌猛进。
