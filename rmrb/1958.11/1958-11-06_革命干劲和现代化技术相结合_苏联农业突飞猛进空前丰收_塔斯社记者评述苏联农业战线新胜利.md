TASS reporter on economic issues, A. Artemov, wrote on the 4th: "The achievements made in Soviet agricultural production this year are unprecedented in the entire history of the Soviet Union since the establishment of Soviet power."

The reporter said that the new victory achieved by the largest republic in the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation, is now clear. Collective farms and state farms in the Russian Federation have sold more than 31 million tons of commercial grain to the state. Earlier, Ukraine and Kazakhstan had sold 9 million tons and 16 million tons of grain to the state, respectively. Thus, the total sales of these three republics this autumn broke the all-Union record of 55 million tons of grain purchased, set in 1956. They provide about nine-tenths of the country's purchases. Acquisition is now continuing.

The unprecedented bumper grain harvest this autumn marks the development of Soviet agriculture in recent years. Thanks to the reclamation of 36 million hectares of wasteland, the grain production center has finally shifted to the east of the Ural Mountains - Siberia and northern Kazakhstan. In four years, Kazakhstan's grain production has increased fivefold, approaching the level of Canada.

The reporter added that according to the views of five years ago, there would be no bumper harvest in Siberia and Kazakhstan this year. The spring in these places was long and cold. In the short summer, dry and hot winds blew from the southern semi-desert area, followed by early autumn with occasional rain and snow. All of these were very unfavorable for grain growth and harvesting. However, the excellent grain yield obtained under such conditions this year shows the growing economic power of Soviet collective farms and state farms in recent years, the organization of collective farmers, and their high level of use of agricultural technology.

According to old views, cotton should also have been a poor harvest this year. In the main cotton-growing areas this year, two-thirds of the cotton seedlings were replanted due to the cold spring. Without powerful technical equipment and the high awareness of the people, Soviet cotton production would probably have been greatly reduced this year. However, by the end of October, 3 million tons of seed cotton had been harvested, which is more than the highest output in the entire history of Soviet cotton cultivation at the same time last year. Currently, only about two-thirds of the cotton planting area has been harvested, but it is already clear to everyone that the yield will be very good, if not breaking the record.

As for the important industrial crop - sugar beet (the Soviet Union ranks first in the world in sugar beet planting, just like wheat production), although not all of it has been harvested yet, it is now obvious that the sugar beet yield will break the record for bumper harvests in the entire history of Soviet sugar beet production. According to statistics, the sugar beet harvest this year will be at least 50 million tons. About 8 million tons of sugar can be made from such a quantity of sugar beets.

Artemov said that the yield of the main oil crop - sunflower - this year is also unprecedented. News from the main planting areas of this crop says that the harvest of many farms is unusual, with a harvest of more than 20 quintals per hectare.

Due to the expansion of maize planting area and the bumper harvest of this crop, the Soviet Union has so far stored about 145 million tons of silage, which is almost five times that of 1953. (Attached picture)

    革命干劲和现代化技术相结合
    苏联农业突飞猛进空前丰收
    塔斯社记者评述苏联农业战线新胜利
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社经济问题记者阿捷莫夫4日写道：“今年苏联农业生产获得的成绩是苏维埃政权建立以来，苏联全部历史上的空前的成绩。”
    这位记者说，苏联十五个加盟共和国中最大的共和国——俄罗斯联邦所取得的新胜利，今天已见分晓。俄罗斯联邦的集体农庄和国营农场向国家交售了三千一百万吨以上的商品谷物。早些时候乌克兰和哈萨克共和国分别向国家交售了九百万吨和一千六百万吨粮食。这样，这三个共和国在今年秋季的总交售量就打破了1956年创造的收购粮食的全苏纪录——五千五百万吨。它们提供的粮食约占国家收购量的十分之九。收购工作现在正在继续进行。
    今年秋天粮食的空前丰收标志着近年来苏联农业的发展。由于开垦了三千六百万公顷的荒地，粮食生产中心终于移到了乌拉尔山的东部——西伯利亚和哈萨克北部。四年来，哈萨克的粮食产量增加了五倍，接近了加拿大的水平。
    记者又说，根据五年前的看法，西伯利亚和哈萨克今年不会出现丰收。这些地方的春季漫长而寒冷。在短短的夏天里，干燥的热风从南部半沙漠地带吹来，然后就是不时有雨和风雪的早秋。所有这些对于粮食的成长和收割都是十分不利的。但是，今年在这种条件下出色地获得的粮食丰产，显示出了近年来苏联集体农庄和国营农场的日益增长的经济威力和集体农民的组织性，以及他们使用农业技术的高度水平。
    根据旧的看法，今年棉花也应当是歉收。今年这种作物的主要种植区由于春天寒冷，棉苗有三分之二进行了补种。如果没有强大的技术装备和人民的高度觉悟，那么，今年苏联的棉花恐怕要大大减产了。可是在10月底就收了三百万吨籽棉，比去年同时期所获得的苏联整个棉花种植史上的最高产量还要多一些。目前大约只有三分之二的棉花种植面积进行了收割，但是，大家已经看得很清楚，产量如果不破纪录也会是很好的。
    至于重要的技术作物——甜菜（苏联在甜菜种植方面同小麦的产量一样，占世界第一位），虽然到现在已经收获的还不是全部，但是现在已经很明显，甜菜的产量将打破苏联整个甜菜生产史的丰产纪录。据统计，今年甜菜的收获量将至少有五千万吨。从这样数量的甜菜中可以制出八百万吨左右的糖。
    阿捷莫夫说，今年主要油料作物——向日葵的产量也是空前的。来自这种作物主要种植区的消息说，许多农场的收获是不寻常的，每公顷的收获量超过了二十公担。
    由于玉蜀黍种植面积的扩大和这种作物的丰收，苏联至今已经贮存了一亿四千五百万吨左右的青贮饲料，这几乎等于1953年的五倍。（附图片）
