    Conquering Cashmere
    Cashmere is a high-grade animal fiber, beautiful in appearance, light, soft and warm. Its finished products, the so-called "cashmere," are regarded as a high-grade woolen fabric. China's cashmere production accounts for more than half of the world's total, and the quality is very good. In the past, due to the lack of combing technology, it could only be exported as raw material, and then foreign "cashmere" was purchased at high prices.
    Recently, woolen mills in Tianjin and Shanghai have successively produced cashmere combing machines, which use them to select coarse and fine wool, solving the key problem of utilizing cashmere raw materials. In terms of the knitting industry, a series of processing technology problems have also been solved. Now, domestically produced men's cashmere shirts are selling well at home and abroad.

    征服了山羊绒
    山羊绒是一种高级动物纤维，外观既美，又轻柔保暖。它的制成品，即所谓“开士米”，被视为一种高级毛织物。我国山羊绒产量占全世界一半以上，而且质量非常好。过去由于没有掌握分梳技术，只能以原料输出，再用高价购买外国的“开士米”。
    最近，天津和上海的毛纺厂先后制成了山羊绒分梳机，用它们剔选粗细毛，解决了利用山羊绒原料的关键问题。针织工业方面，也解决了一系列的加工技术问题。现在，国产的男开士米衫，已经畅销国内外了。
