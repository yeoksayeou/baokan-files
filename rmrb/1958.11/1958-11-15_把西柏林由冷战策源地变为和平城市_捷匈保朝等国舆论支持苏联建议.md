    Turn West Berlin from a Hotbed of the Cold War into a City of Peace
    Public Opinion in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, North Korea, and Other Countries Supports Soviet Proposal

    Xinhua News Agency - The press in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Democratic People's Republic of Korea support Khrushchev's proposal on the 10th to end the remnants of the occupation regime in Berlin.

    The Czechoslovakian "Red Right Daily" published a commentary on the 13th, saying that the Soviet proposal is justified, and the realization of this proposal is in the interests of European peace. The commentary pointed out that the reason why Western countries demand to maintain the status quo in Berlin is only because it is beneficial to them, even though they themselves have long undermined the legal basis for their continued presence in West Berlin.

    The Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" published an article on the 12th saying that the statement by the head of the Soviet government on ending the remnants of the Berlin occupation system is a new peace initiative by the Soviet government, which will greatly help to transform West Berlin from a hotbed of the Cold War into a peaceful city. The article pointed out that Western imperialism and German militarists use West Berlin as a center for American intelligence agencies, espionage activities, and the revival of fascism. The article said that this situation should have ended long ago.

    The Bulgarian "Agricultural Banner" also welcomed the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers' proposal on the 13th, and criticized the ruling groups in Washington, London, and Bonn for their reaction to the proposal. The newspaper pointed out that the extreme opposition of Western ruling groups to this timely Soviet proposal is an extremely dangerous attitude. The newspaper said that the attitude of Western countries towards the Soviet proposal once again exposes the opposition of Western ruling groups to any steps to normalize the situation in Germany.

    A commentary in the "Democratic Korea Daily" on the 13th stated that Western imperialists, headed by the United States, have consistently violated the Potsdam Agreement, which aimed to prevent the revival of German militarism and fascism forever, in West Germany. The commentary said: "In this situation, it is entirely reasonable to reconsider the issue of the continued stationing of troops by the Western powers in West Berlin and their continued enjoyment of 'Allied' privileges." The commentary warned against the clamor of the United States to maintain its rule over West Berlin "by force," and commented: "Today, the power of the united socialist family can defeat any conspiracy of the enemy. Those who resist this power will only destroy themselves."

    把西柏林由冷战策源地变为和平城市
    捷匈保朝等国舆论支持苏联建议
    新华社讯　捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚和民主朝鲜的舆论支持赫鲁晓夫10日提出的结束占领柏林制度的残余的建议。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”13日发表评论说，苏联的建议是正当的，实现这个建议是符合欧洲和平的利益的。评论指出，西方国家之所以要求保持柏林的现状，这只是由于这对它们有利，尽管它们自己早已破坏了它们继续留在西柏林的法律根据。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”12日发表文章说，苏联政府首脑关于结束占领柏林制度残余的声明是苏联政府的新的和平倡议，这个倡议将大大有助于把西柏林从冷战策源地变成和平的城市。文章指出，西方帝国主义及德国军国主义者把西柏林作为美国情报机关、间谍活动以及复活法西斯的中心。文章说，早就应该结束这种状况。
    保加利亚“农业旗帜报”13日也欢迎苏联部长会议主席的建议，并且抨击华盛顿、伦敦和波恩统治集团对这一建议的反应。这家报纸指出，西方统治集团极端反对苏联的这个及时的建议，这是一种极端危险的态度。报纸说，西方国家对苏联建议所抱的态度再一次暴露出了西方统治集团反对任何使德国局势正常化的步骤。
    “民主朝鲜报”13日的评论说，以美国为首的西方帝国主义者在西德一贯违反永远防止德国军国主义和法西斯主义复活的波茨坦协定。评论说：“在这种情况下，重新考虑西方大国在西柏林继续驻扎军队的问题和它们继续享有‘同盟国’特权问题，是十分理所当然的事情。”评论警告美国“用武力”维持它对西柏林的统治的叫嚣，评论说：“今天，团结一致的社会主义大家庭的威力，可以击败敌人的任何策动。抗拒这一威力的人必将自取灭亡”。
