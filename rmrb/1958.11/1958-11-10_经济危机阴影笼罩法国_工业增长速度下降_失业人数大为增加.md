    (Report from our newspaper) Recently, signs of crisis in the French economy have become increasingly apparent. The growth rate of industrial production has significantly decreased. The number of orders in sectors such as aviation, machinery, metallurgy, shipbuilding, fuel, construction, and cotton and wool textiles continues to shrink. For example, aviation factories have not received new orders since the end of last year. The order volume in the metallurgical industry has dropped to only the equivalent of three months' worth of work. Prices are constantly rising. According to official French statistics, the retail price index for 250 items rose by 4% in September compared to August, and 20% compared to June of last year. In the case of food, prices have risen by a quarter in the past year. In the first week of October, 15 of 23 food items, including beef, fruit, vegetables, and sugar, continued to rise in price.
    The economic recession in France has severely affected the lives of the working people. Currently, the phenomenon of layoffs and reduced working hours has spread throughout France. According to official statistics, the number of unemployed workers receiving relief is 12% higher than in July. In recent months, the number of people seeking employment but unable to find work has increased by 20%. The French newspaper "Les Echos" reported that due to irregular working hours, the number of partially unemployed people in France has reached one million.

    经济危机阴影笼罩法国
    工业增长速度下降　失业人数大为增加
    本报讯  最近以来，法国经济中的危机迹象日益明显。工业生产增长速度大大下降。航空、机械、冶金、造船、燃料、建筑、棉毛纺织等部门订货的数量继续缩减。像航空工业各工厂从去年年底以来一直没有接到新的订单。冶金工业的订货额降到了只等于三个月的工作量。物价不断上涨。据法国官方统计，二百五十种物品的零售价格指数9月比8月上涨4％，较去年6月上涨20％。如果就食品而论，则一年来已经涨价四分之一，在10月第一周，二十三种食品中就有包括牛肉、水果、蔬菜、糖等十五种食品在继续涨价。
    法国的经济衰退严重地影响了劳动人民的生活。目前解雇工人和缩短开工时间的现象已经波及法国全境。据官方统计，现在受救济的失业工人比7月增加12％。近几月来，要求就业但是没有找到工作的人已经增加20％。法国“回声报”说，由于劳动时间不定，法国部分失业者人数已达到一百万人。
