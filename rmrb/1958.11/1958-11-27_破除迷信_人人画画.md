　　Breaking Superstition: Everyone Paints
　　Huang Qinwen, Farmer of Jiashan, Zhejiang

　　This year, when our Hongxi Township in Jiashan County established the People's Commune, the Cultural Center held a meeting saying that People's Communes should be run by the people, and everyone should be mobilized to write their ideals on the walls and paint them on the walls. I thought, having just gotten rid of illiteracy in March, how could I write poetry and paint? The masses felt the same way as me! But then I thought, it's the Great Leap Forward, so let's just do it! However, when I reported back to the branch secretary, he also lacked confidence. In the end, we still firmly decided to proceed, and convened a Youth League branch meeting, deciding to first mobilize the youth production team. We started that very night. When we mobilized the youth production team, everyone asked how to paint? But I myself didn't know how to paint! I said, "Now that we have a People's Commune, what are your ideals? Let's talk about them first." Everyone started talking, some wanted to drive tractors, some wanted to... But how to paint? At that time, I wanted a single rice plant to yield 60,000 jin. So I drew a rice plant on the wall, not caring if it looked like one or not. I wanted to draw myself sitting on top of the rice plant without it collapsing, but I couldn't see my own face, how to draw that? I just painted it, not caring if it looked right or not. After finishing the drawing, I wrote four lines:

　　The People's Commune has high yields, aiming for 60,000 jin of rice.
　　I will sit on top of the rice plant, guaranteeing the rice seedlings won't be crushed.

　　After I finished painting, everyone laughed, some saying I dared to speak and dared to imagine, others saying that the painting didn't look like me but like Guanyin. No matter what, I had expressed my ideal through painting. Later, everyone else also started painting. But three or four brushes weren't enough, what to do? Everyone came up with the idea of tying grass into brushes, softening the tips, and using kiln coal as ink. All twenty-nine youths started painting, their enthusiasm growing higher and higher.

　　Everyone truly dared to speak and dared to imagine. In two hours, this small team was already filled with poetry and paintings. The branch secretary came to take a look, he said it was very good, and could see that their minds had been liberated. The branch secretary also painted, and so did the commune leader. But what about the other eleven small teams? That night, we convened an on-site meeting at the youth team for all the teams. At that time, Yu Longbao, a mother of six children, was very enthusiastic after seeing it. She said, "If the youth can paint, can't we?" Therefore, everyone expressed their determination to get it done in two nights. As long as the masses are mobilized, nothing is impossible. After two days and two nights of hard work, 90% of the members of our entire Liming Cooperative wrote poetry and painted, creating a total of 937 paintings and writing 1,043 poems. The oldest was seventy-three years old, and the youngest was seven years old, all participating, realizing the whole cooperative being filled with poetry and painting, with cadres, masses, men, women, old and young all involved. Moreover, the content of the paintings had very good political significance.

　　After the poetry and painting were launched, other activities were also fully developed, such as the socialist long-term planning model exhibition, which only cost two jiao to set up; the exhibition on liberating Taiwan was successfully organized by the secretary leading the masses in one night. Soon, we launched the second round of painting and poetry writing, with the theme of "Working Hard for Three Years to Realize the Plan." This time it was even more in-depth. Even the cooks in the canteen painted, one of them drawing a person cooking dishes, with the words:

　　The public canteen is truly good, the cooks also find the knack,
　　Improving all kinds of dishes, making the commune members smile contentedly.

　　In short, our poetry and paintings have ideals, aspirations, and determination, as well as praise and criticism, and each time we feel that the content is richer.

　　Now we are launching the third round of poetry and painting. The situation is very different this time. 95% of the young and middle-aged people have been transferred to work on steelmaking, leaving behind mostly women and the elderly, with only me and another comrade among the young women. Without young people, how can we carry out activities? We seized on agricultural tool reform and technological innovation to launch the poetry and painting movement again. Everyone thought of new agricultural tools and drew them. The People's Commune is organized militarily, and the entire battalion works together. Women live together, and there are more houses, so we take off the door panels and paint on them, with both praise and criticism, one piece per person, carrying them to the fields. Therefore, during the autumn harvest and winter planting, club activities are moved to the fields. Now that life is collectivized, the conditions for cultural propaganda work are even more favorable.

　　The little success that our cooperative's art activities have achieved is mainly due to the Party's leadership and deep mobilization of the masses, truly achieving everyone's participation. In the future, we will continue to improve, but I think improvement mainly depends on the masses themselves to improve. We are preparing to mobilize those who paint well to lead those who paint relatively poorly, so that everyone can paint well. In addition, we also need professional artists to guide us, so that our art creation activities can be popularized more quickly and on a larger scale.

    破除迷信　人人画画
    浙江嘉善农民　黄琴文
    我们嘉善县洪溪乡今年在办人民公社时，文化馆开了会，说人民公社要人民来办，要发动大家把理想写在墙头上，画在墙头上。我想今年3月里文盲刚刚扫掉，要我写诗画画，那怎么行？群众也同我一样呀！另外又想着大跃进了，搞就搞吧！但回去向支部书记汇报时，书记也有些信心不足，最后我们仍然坚决要搞，召开了团支部会议，决定先动员青年生产队。当晚就搞。到青年生产队一发动，大家说怎么画法？但怎么画法我自己也不知道呀！我说：“办人民公社了，你有啥理想先谈出来。”大家都谈开了，有的说要开拖拉机，有的说要……。但怎么画呢？当时我就想要一棵稻能收六万斤。我就在墙上画一棵稻，像不像不去管它，我要画自己坐在稻头上不会倒伏，但我又看不见自己面孔，怎么画呢？画上去再说，像不像也不管它，画好后我写着四句：
    人民公社产量高，要收六万斤的稻。
    我要坐在稻头上，稻苗保证不压倒。
    我画完后，大家都笑开了，有的说我敢说敢想，有的说画的不像我像个观世音。不管怎样我总把理想画出来了，后来大家也都画了。可是三、四支笔不够用，怎么办呢？大家想出了用草扎成笔，头上打打软，用窑煤代墨，二十九个青年都动手画了，劲头越画越高。
    大家真是敢说敢想，两个钟头这个小队已经诗画化了。支部书记跑来一看，他说很好，一看思想也解放了。支部书记也画，社长也画。但还有十一个小队怎么办呢？当夜就召集各队在青年队开现场会议。当时有六个孩子的妈妈余龙宝看了后，劲头也很大，她说：“青年能画我们难道画不来？”因此大家都表示决心，保证两夜搞起来。群众只要发动起来，没有什么办不到的。苦战了两天两夜，我们整个黎明社90％的社员都写诗画画，共画了九百三十七幅，写诗一千零四十三首，年纪最大的七十三岁，最小的七岁都动手画，实现了干部群众、男女老少全社诗画化。而且画的内容政治意义都很好。
    诗画搞起来后，其他活动也全面开展起来，如社会主义远景规划模型展览，只花了二角钱就搞起来了；解放台湾的展览，是书记带头依靠群众一个晚上就办成功。不久我们第二次又发动了画画写诗，题目是苦战三年，实现规划。这一次更加深入了。连食堂炊事员也画了画，他画一个人在烧小菜，上面写着：
    公共食堂真正好，炊事员也把窍门找，
    各种品菜来提高，社员吃得咪咪笑。
    总之，我们的诗画，有理想，有志愿，有决心，也有表扬批评，一次比一次感到内容丰富。
    现在是发动第三次搞诗画了。第三次情况大大不同了。95％的青壮年都抽调去搞钢铁了，留下的都是妇女和老人，妇女中青年只有我和另一个同志。没有青年活动怎么搞法呢？我们便抓住农具改革，技术革新又搞起诗画运动。大家想新式农具就画新式农具。人民公社组织军事化了，整个营大协作，妇女住在一起，房子多了，我们就把门板除下来，上面画画，也有表扬批评，一个人一块，掮到田头。所以在秋收冬种时，俱乐部活动搬到了田头。现在生活集体化了，搞文化宣传工作条件更加有利。
    我们社的美术活动取得的这一点点成绩，主要是由于党的领导和深入发动群众，真正做到了人人动手。今后还要不断提高，但是，我想提高主要是依靠群众自己去提高。我们准备发动那些画得好的去带动画得比较差的，让人人都画得好。另外，我们也很需要专业画家对我们作辅导，使我们的美术创作活动能够更快更大的普及。
