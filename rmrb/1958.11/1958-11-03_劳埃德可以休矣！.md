Observer's Commentary

Lloyd Should Retire!

British Foreign Secretary Lloyd made a statement in the House of Commons on October 30 regarding the Far East issue. He began by denying that the "conflict between the Chinese Communists and the Chinese Nationalists" was an internal affair, instead describing it as a dispute between "two Chinas." Lloyd spoke at length about the so-called "no use of force" issue and clamored that the United States must not "yield to the use of force on the Taiwan and coastal islands issue." He believed that an "international atmosphere of public opinion against the use of force" should be created, and demanded that the parties concerned "show some flexibility in their attitude." In Lloyd's view, the United States' "efforts to promote a ceasefire" have demonstrated an attitude of "flexibility," while the "attitude of the Beijing government is completely inflexible."

How much these words resemble Dulles' voice! The dignified British Foreign Secretary is actually dancing to Dulles' tune. On September 25, Lloyd had already given such a performance at the United Nations General Assembly. At that time, Dulles said that the Chinese people's shelling of Jinmen was a "serious threat" to peace; Lloyd followed by saying that the shelling of Jinmen "aggravated the crisis." Dulles said that the United States "hoped to achieve a ceasefire soon"; Lloyd followed by saying that Britain hoped to "stop this act of using force." Now, under pressure from the situation, Dulles' tune has changed, so Lloyd immediately came out to give a new performance, the purpose of which is to help Dulles peddle the so-called "two Chinas" plan.

Like Dulles, Lloyd desperately grasps the so-called "no use of force" as a lifeline and makes a big deal out of it. But everyone knows that the principle of no use of force can only be applied to international disputes and cannot be used as a tool to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu are Chinese territories. Whether the Chinese people fight or reconcile with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, whether they fight and stop or fight and stop halfway, is China's internal affair, and no foreign country has the right to interfere. Here, there is no question of the "no use of force" that Lloyd mentioned, let alone any question of the United States "yielding." Lloyd's nonsense on this point is obviously deliberately mystifying in order to deceive people. The universally recognized fact is that the United States has occupied China's territory of Taiwan and has amassed a large military force in the Taiwan Strait area, carrying out military threats and war provocations against the Chinese people. This is the most blatant act of using force in international relations. British Labor Party leader Bevan also pointed out after Lloyd's speech that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the status of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu has been determined by the United States' use of force. If we want to talk about opposing the use of force, we should demand that the United States military forces withdraw from Taiwan. However, Lloyd turns a blind eye to these facts and instead tries to defend the American aggressors in every possible way. It can be seen that he is not opposing the "use of force" at all. On the contrary, he is vigorously supporting the United States' use of force against China's Taiwan and following the United States in interfering in China's internal affairs.

Lloyd praised the United States for "working to bring about a ceasefire" while attacking the Chinese government's attitude as "completely inflexible," which further reveals Lloyd's true intention to help the United States create "two Chinas." As everyone knows, the United States is trying to draw a dividing line between Taiwan and the mainland as a step towards creating "two Chinas" and permanently occupying Taiwan. The so-called "ceasefire" is a poisonous plan to interfere in China's internal affairs and to invade China. The Chinese people will never accept it and it has been condemned by fair public opinion around the world. Lloyd and his ilk openly condone and support the United States' policy of aggression and provocation against China, which can only prove that they are accomplices of the United States. History has repeatedly proven that condoning aggressors will only harm oneself. The United States' conspiracy to create "two Chinas" is not only an expedient measure in the process of the United States turning Taiwan into its colony, but this policy itself is a war policy. As the British "Political Monthly" said, "Any plan to solve the Asian crisis by cutting off a part of Chinese territory is not a solution. It can only become the source of international conflict and potential war danger."

Lloyd's fallacies published on October 30 were not without reason. After the United States' conspiracy to create "two Chinas" became public, Britain believed that the time had come, eager to try, and wanted to show its skills in this conspiracy. So Lloyd and his ilk took the lead in carrying out activities for the United States. Lloyd said triumphantly that Britain will "use our (referring to Britain) influence." How to use "influence"? That is to drag more countries into the water, create a so-called "international atmosphere of public opinion," and force the Chinese people to accept "two Chinas." Britain is a country that has diplomatic relations with China. Its foreign minister openly engages in such blatant activities hostile to the Chinese people, and openly praises the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This is an extremely unfriendly expression towards China, and the Chinese people cannot but express their indignation.

The Chinese people's position of safeguarding their territory and sovereignty and opposing "two Chinas" will never waver. It will not work for the Americans to create "two Chinas," it will not work for the British to create "two Chinas," and it will not work for anyone to create "two Chinas." We want to solemnly warn Lloyd: It is futile to serve Dulles and carry out activities for "two Chinas." We believe that all countries and people upholding justice will not be fooled by Dulles, nor will they be fooled by Lloyd.

### 劳埃德可以休矣！

专栏：观察家评论

    劳埃德可以休矣！
    英国外交大臣劳埃德10月30日在下院作了关于远东问题的发言。他一开头就否认“中国共产党人和中国国民党人之间的冲突”是内政，而把它说成是“两个中国”之间的争端。劳埃德大谈所谓“不使用武力”问题，并且叫喊美国不能“对于在台湾和沿海岛屿问题上使用武力屈服”。他认为，应该创造一种“反对使用武力的国际舆论气氛”，并且要求有关方面“在态度上表现某种灵活性”。在劳埃德看来，美国“努力促成实现停火”，已表现了态度“灵活”；而“北京政府的态度是完全不灵活的”。
    这些话，是多么像杜勒斯的声音啊！堂堂的英国外交大臣原来是跟着杜勒斯的笛音跳舞的。9月25日，劳埃德在联合国大会上就曾经做过一次这样的表演。当时，杜勒斯说，中国人民炮击金门是对和平的“严重威胁”；劳埃德跟着说，炮击金门“使危机加剧”了。杜勒斯说，美国“希望很快实现停火”；劳埃德跟着说，英国希望“停止这个使用武力的行动”。现在，迫于形势，杜勒斯的调子变了，于是劳埃德就立刻出来做新的表演，其目的是要帮助杜勒斯兜售所谓“两个中国”的计划。
    劳埃德和杜勒斯一样，拚命抓住所谓“不使用武力”这根救命草大做文章。但是谁都知道，不使用武力的原则只能适用于国际争端中，而不能把它作为干涉他国内政的工具。台澎金马是中国领土，中国人民同蒋介石集团之间不论是打还是和，是打打停停还是半打半停，都是中国的内政，任何外国都无权干涉。在这里，根本不存在劳埃德所谓的
  “不使用武力”的问题，更不存在什么美国“屈服”的问题。劳埃德对此信口雌黄，显然是在故弄玄虚，借以骗人。人所共见的事实是，美国侵占了中国领土台湾，并且在台湾海峡地区集结庞大兵力，对中国人民进行军事威胁和战争挑衅，这是在国际关系上使用武力的最露骨的行为。英国工党领袖比万在劳埃德发言后也指出，自从中华人民共和国成立以来，台澎金马的地位就一直是由美国的武力所决定的。要谈反对使用武力，就应该要求美国军事力量从台湾撤走。但是，劳埃德却对这些事实视而不见，反而百般替美国侵略者辩解。可见他根本不是要反对什么“使用武力”，恰恰相反，它是在极力支持美国对中国台湾使用武力，并且跟着美国干涉中国内政。
    劳埃德赞扬美国“努力促成实现停火”，同时反过来攻击中国政府的态度“完全不灵活”，这就更加透露了劳埃德帮助美国制造“两个中国”的真情。大家知道，美国企图在台湾和大陆之间划一条分界线，作为制造“两个中国”和长期霸占台湾的一个步骤。所谓“停火”，是干涉中国内政和侵略中国的毒计，中国人民绝对不会接受，并且也受到全世界公正舆论的谴责。劳埃德之流公然纵容和支持美国对中国的侵略和挑衅政策，只能证明他们是美国的帮凶。历史一再证明，纵容侵略者，结果只会害了自己。美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，不但是美国把台湾变成它的殖民地过程中的一种权宜之计，而且这个政策本身就是一个战争政策。正同英国“政治月刊”所说，“以割掉中国领土一部分来解决亚洲危机的任何方案都不是解决办法。它只能成为国际冲突和潜在战争危险的根源。”
    劳埃德10月30日发表的谬论，不是没有缘由的。美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋表面化以后，英国认为时机已至，跃跃欲试，想在这个阴谋中一显身手。于是劳埃德之流就带头出来替美国进行活动。劳埃德得意忘形地说，英国将“使用我们（指英国）的影响”。怎样使用“影响”呢？那就是把更多的国家拉下水，造成所谓“国际舆论气氛”，强迫中国人民接受“两个中国”。英国是同中国有外交关系的国家，它的外交大臣公然进行这样露骨的敌视中国人民的活动，而且公然为蒋介石集团吹捧，这是对中国极不友好的表示，中国人民不能不表示愤慨。
    中国人民维护自己的领土和主权的立场，反对“两个中国”的立场，决不会动摇。美国人想制造“两个中国”是不行的，英国人想制造“两个中国”同样是不行的，任何人想制造“两个中国”都是不行的。我们要正告劳埃德：为杜勒斯效劳，进行“两个中国”的活动，是徒劳无益的。我们相信，一切主持正义的国家和人民都不会上杜勒斯的当，也不会上劳埃德的当。
