    Mechanical Stone Crushing: Saving Labor and Increasing Efficiency

    In September, during his inspection tour of Jiangsu Province, Comrade Shaoqi instructed that the use of crushers could alleviate physical labor and save a great deal of manpower. When Comrade Shaoqi heard that a machine had been developed that could replace the labor of fifty people, he said: That's very good, we must promote it quickly.

    One Machine Replaces 500 Laborers

    This newspaper reports that the Changchun Public-Private Joint Venture Tongxing Tool Factory in Jilin Province recently manufactured seven jaw crushers to support iron and steel production.

    In the process of manufacturing the crushers, all the factory workers displayed the communist spirit of daring to think and daring to act. Although the factory did not have a gantry planer, boring machine, or large lathe, and the existing equipment was completely unsuitable for manufacturing ore crushers weighing three and a half tons each, under the leadership of the Party branch, the workers adopted the method of "ants gnawing on bones" to overcome the difficulties of insufficient equipment.

    The factory had no engineers or technicians, only one eighth-grade worker. In order to solve the technical problems, the vast majority of veteran workers in the factory devoted themselves to the manufacture of the crushers and fully displayed their initiative. They finally overcame the difficulties of insufficient equipment and technical strength and completed the task of manufacturing seven ore crushers on October 22 as originally planned. The production volume of each crusher is equivalent to the working capacity of 500 laborers, powerfully supporting iron and steel production.

    Over Thirty Tons of Stone Crushed Daily

    This newspaper reports that the Shandan Agricultural Implement Repair Factory in Shandan County, Gansu Province, launched a vigorous technical revolution and manufactured two stone crushers on October 26. After trial runs, they operated well. Each machine can crush more than 30 tons of ore per day, replacing three to four hundred laborers.

    The Shandan Agricultural Implement Repair Factory is a small factory with extremely simple equipment. The entire factory only had a hand-cranked small drill and a hand-cranked grinder. It only started sand casting a month ago. The workers overcame many difficulties. Without machine tools, they used hacksaws and files; without electric welding, they used rivets. After seven days of hard work, they finally succeeded in the trial production.

    Stone Crushing Without Manual Labor Ten Times More Efficient

    This newspaper reports that the Xuanhua Iron Factory in Dawu County, Hubei Province, recently successfully trial-produced a stone crusher and stone mortar.

    The factory has a total of fifty-seven indigenous blast furnaces, all using ore for iron smelting. Every day, five hundred and twenty workers have to manually hammer the ore, accounting for 20% of the entire iron smelting labor force, and sometimes the supply cannot meet the needs. In order to solve this problem, the workers set up a tool reform group on the construction site. After several days of hard work, they finally successfully trial-produced the stone crusher and stone mortar. After testing and appraisal: the stone crusher requires four people to operate, and can crush about 20,000 catties of ore a day, increasing efficiency seven times. The stone mortar only requires two people to operate, and can crush 5,000 catties of ore a day, increasing efficiency ten times compared to manual hammering.

    Two Hundred Catties of Ore Smashed in Two Hits

    This newspaper reports that Xie Genlin, a young draftsman at the Technical Design Office of the Shenxin Textile Factory in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, recently designed a hammer crusher powered by a motor and driven by a belt, according to the technical data provided by Zhang Heyou, a wire maintenance worker in the factory's second workshop. The hammering force of this stone crusher is as high as half a ton. A piece of iron ore weighing two hundred catties can usually be smashed and screened into the indigenous blast furnace with just one or two hammer blows. It only requires two people to operate and can crush about 20 tons of ore per day.

    The structure of this stone crusher is quite simple. The main components are a motor, two sets of bridge belts, a pair of pressure rollers (with eccentric wheels inside), a lifting timber, a heavy hammer, two light rails, and an iron pier. Before hammering, pull the "switch", the pressure roller will clamp the lifting timber with the heavy hammer, and lift it up; release the "switch", the pressure roller will automatically release the lifting timber, allowing the heavy hammer to quickly and steadily descend along the light rail, directly hammering the iron pier.

    Editorial Note

    Mass-Produce Crushers

    In mass iron and steel production, the crushing of ore, fuel, and refractory materials is still mostly done by manual hammering, occupying a large amount of labor and failing to meet the needs of production development.

    What to do? There is only one solution: use crushers to replace manual labor. Now, mechanical factories in many places have begun to allocate manpower and rush to manufacture crushing machinery. However, the tens of thousands of indigenous furnaces spread across the country cannot all be supplied by the mechanical industry departments. It is also necessary to mobilize the masses to mass-produce indigenous crushers. The masses have many methods. As long as the wisdom of the masses is fully utilized, a variety of simple, easy-to-operate indigenous crushers and crushing tools will be manufactured continuously.

    Relying on the masses to build machinery is a major event, and it is the fundamental way to thoroughly reduce physical labor and improve production efficiency. Some people only shout about labor shortages but still do not know how to solve this problem. The examples of manufacturing crushers in various places tell people: after mass-producing various indigenous machines, the problem of labor shortages will naturally be eliminated.

    碎石用机械　省人又省力
    少奇同志9月份在江苏省视察工作时，曾指示：用上破碎机，可以减轻体力劳动，节约很多劳动力。少奇同志听到已制成一种机器，一部机器抵五十个人的劳动时，他说：那很好，要赶紧推广。
    一台顶五百个劳动力
    本报讯　吉林省长春公私合营同兴工具厂在最近制成七台颚式矿石粉碎机，支援了钢铁生产。
    在制造粉碎机的过程中，全厂职工发挥了敢想敢干的共产主义精神。这个工厂虽然没有龙门刨床、镗床，也没有大车床；而且原有的设备完全不适合制造每台重达三吨半的矿石粉碎机，但是在党支部的领导下，工人们采取了蚂蚁啃骨头的办法克服了设备不足的困难。
    这个工厂没有工程师、技术员，只有一名八级工人，为了解决技术上的问题，全厂绝大部分老工人都投入了制造粉碎机的工作，并且充分发挥了积极性。他们终于战胜了设备和技术力量不足的困难，按原计划于10月22日完成了七台矿石粉碎机的任务。每台粉碎机的生产量相当于五百名劳动力的工作能力，有力地支援了钢铁生产。
    每天碎石三十多吨
    本报讯　甘肃省山丹县山丹农具修配厂，大闹技术革命，在10月26日制成碎石机两台。经过试车，运转良好。每日每台可碎矿石三十多吨，能代替三、四百个劳动力。
    山丹农具修配厂是一个设备极为简单的小厂子，全厂只有一台手摇小钻和一个手摇砂轮，一个月前才有了翻砂。职工们克服了不少困难，没有机床就用钢锯锉，没有电焊就用铆钉铆，经过七天苦战，终于试制成功。
    碎石不用手工效大十倍
    本报讯　湖北省大悟县宣化铁厂，最近试制碎石机和舂石臼成功。
    这个厂共五十七个土高炉，全部用矿石炼铁，每天要五百二十个工人用手工捶打碎石，占去了整个炼铁劳力的20％，有时还供应不上需要。为了解决这个问题，职工们在工地上成立了工具改革小组，经过几天苦战，终于试制成了碎石机和舂石臼。经过试验鉴定：碎石机四个人操作，一天可打矿石二万斤左右，提高工效七倍。舂石臼，只要两人操作，一天可舂碎矿石五千斤，比手捶矿石工效提高十倍。
    两百斤的矿石两下就打碎
    本报讯　江苏省无锡市申新纺织厂技术设计室青年绘图员谢根林，最近按照这个厂第二车间钢丝保全工张和友提供的技术资料，设计出一种以马达为动力，用皮带传动的锤击碎石机。这种碎石机锤击力高达半吨左右。一块二百市斤重的铁矿石，一般只要锤一两下，便可击碎过筛，送入土高炉。它只要两个人操纵，每天可击碎矿石二十吨左右。
    这种碎石机，构造相当简单，主要部件是一台马达，两付过桥皮带，一对压辊（内带偏心轮），一块升降木，一个重锤，两条轻便铁轨，一个铁墩。锤击前一拉“开关”，压辊即将装着重锤的升降木夹住，往上提升；一松“开关”，压辊又自动放开升降木，让重锤沿着轻便铁轨迅速稳妥猛降，直锤铁墩。
    编后
    大造破碎机
    群众性的钢铁生产中，矿石、燃料和耐火材料的破碎工作，绝大部分还是手工捶击，占用了大批劳动力，还不能满足生产发展的需要。
    怎么办？办法只有一条，就是用上破碎机代替手工劳动。现在，许多地方的机械工厂，已经开始抽调力量，赶制破碎机械，但是，密布全国的数以万计的土炉，不能都靠机械工业部门来供应，还需要发动群众，大造土破碎机。群众的办法是很多的。只要把群众的智慧充分发挥出来，那末，多种多样、结构简单、操作容易的土破碎机和破碎工具，就会源源制造出来。
    依靠群众造机械是一件大事，是彻底减轻体力劳动，提高生产效率的根本道路。有些人只是叫喊劳动力紧张，却还不知道怎样解决这个问题。各地制造破碎机的事例告诉人们：在大造各种各样的土机械以后，劳动力紧张问题就自然消除了。（附图片）
