    The Wuhan Academy of Sciences History Group Conducts Revolutionary History Investigation
    Under the direct leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the History Group of the Wuhan Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted an investigation of the revolutionary history of Qiliping District, Hong'an County, lasting more than one hundred days from April to August. More than 100 people directly participated in this investigation, including all comrades from the History Group of the Institute, comrades from the Provincial Propaganda Department and the Fifth Intermediate Party School of the Central Committee, and teachers and students from the third grade of the History Department of Wuhan University. During the investigation, they interviewed more than 900 revolutionary veterans and held 247 small-scale symposiums based on agricultural cooperatives. By mid-August, they had basically completed the investigation of the Qiliping District and had initially sorted out the investigative materials. These historical materials can not only be used to compile the history of revolutionary struggle and the chronicle of events in Qiliping, but also provide important materials for compiling the history of revolutionary struggle and the chronicle of events in the old base areas of Hubei, Henan and Anhui, and Hong'an County.
    The Institute of Hydrobiology of the Academy of Sciences Discovers Rice "Eternal Fertilizer"
    The Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has found a promising new bio-fertilizer for rice, which is widely planted in our country—blue-green algae fertilizer.
    Blue-green algae is a lower plant. Some blue-green algae, like nitrogen-fixing bacteria, can fix free nitrogen from the air and turn it into organic nitrogen in the algae body. Ordinary nitrogen-fixing bacteria are aerobic and do not grow well in paddy fields, but these blue-green algae can grow and reproduce in paddy fields. It secretes part of the organic nitrogen in its body during its life, and when it dies and decomposes, it dissolves a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the water and soil, which becomes nitrogen fertilizer that can be used by rice. Therefore, the growth and reproduction of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae in paddy fields is like opening a nitrogen fertilizer factory in paddy fields. Air is an inexhaustible source of raw materials, and paddy fields are the factory buildings. Moreover, blue-green algae has a strong ability to live. As long as the conditions are suitable, it can reproduce naturally in paddy fields without annual application. It can be said to be the ideal "eternal fertilizer".
    Foreign countries that have conducted research on nitrogen fixation by blue-green algae include Britain, the United States, Japan, and India, with Japan having achieved the most. In the past six months, the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has collected many specimens in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and other places, and has carried out various experimental work, and has found four kinds of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae. Among them, one kind of Nostoc (No. 686) has the highest nitrogen fixation capacity. In 100 ml of nitrogen-deficient culture medium, under sterilization conditions, the amount of nitrogen fixed after four days of growth and reproduction is 1.01 mg. The amount of nitrogen fixed by blue-green algae is the sum of the amount of nitrogen increased in the nitrogen-deficient culture medium and the calculated amount of increase, excluding the amount of blue-green algae inoculated. In general experimental processes, blue-green algae reproduces relatively slowly at the beginning after sterilization. However, our nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae grows very fast in the first four days, and if it reproduces for sixty days, the amount of nitrogen fixed will significantly exceed the current world's highest level.
    The Anfeng Township Committee of the Communist Party of China Launches a Theoretical Publication
    The "Emancipate the Mind" magazine, sponsored by the Anfeng Township Committee of Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, was launched in October. It is a popular theoretical publication mainly aimed at grassroots cadres. It is the first theoretical publication sponsored by a township committee in Xinghua County. The task of "Emancipate the Mind" is to: publicize Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, criticize various bourgeois ideological viewpoints, publicize the Party's general line and various policies; summarize and promote advanced experience, expound the superiority of the socialist system and people's communes; and focus on reflecting the achievements of socialist construction and the new social outlook.
    The inaugural issue of "Emancipate the Mind" has a total of nine articles. The main articles include the inaugural speech "Emancipate the Mind" by Qu Jiashi, the secretary of the township party committee, and "Pulling out White Flags and Inserting Red Flags in Tanggang Area," co-authored by him and Zhu Tingzhen, the former deputy secretary of the Tanggang Township Party Committee; "People's Commune is Good" by Xu Bingrang, a cadre sent down from the Central Ministry of Culture; and "An Inspiring Grand Plan" by Dou Ruiqing, a teacher at Anfeng Primary School. "Emancipate the Mind" magazine is published semi-monthly, mimeographed in 16-open format, with short, concise, lively, and easy-to-understand articles.

    武汉科学院历史组进行革命史的调查工作
    中国科学院武汉哲学社会科学研究所历史组，在中共湖北省委宣传部的直接领导下，从4月到8月，进行了历时一百多天的红安县七里坪区革命史调查工作。直接参加这次调查的共一百多人，其中包括这个研究所历史组的全体同志，省委宣传部和中共中央第五中级党校的同志，以及武汉大学历史系三年级的师生。他们在进行调查工作的期间，访问了革命老人九百多人，召开了以农业社为单位的小型座谈会二百四十七次。8月中旬，他们已经基本上完成了七里坪区的调查工作，并且已初步整理出调查材料。这些史料不仅可以用来编撰七里坪革命斗争史和大事年表，并且为编撰鄂豫皖老根据地和红安县的革命斗争史和大事年表提供了重要材料。
    科学院水生生物研究所发现水稻“万年肥”
    中国科学院水生生物研究所已经为我国种植面积广大的水稻，找到了一种很有希望的新的生物肥料——蓝藻肥料。
    蓝藻是一种低等植物。有些蓝藻同固氮细菌一样，能够把空气中游离的氮素固定下来，成为藻体内的有机氮。一般的固氮细菌是好气性的，在水田里成长不好，而这些蓝藻却能在水田中生长繁殖。它在生活时将体内部分的有机氮分泌出来，在死亡分解时更把大量的氮肥溶解在水中、土中，成为水稻所能利用的氮肥。因此，固氮蓝藻在稻田中生长繁殖，就像在稻田中开设氮肥工厂一样，空气就是用之不尽取之不竭的原料，稻田就是厂房。并且，蓝藻有较强的生活能力，只要条件合适，就能在水田中自然繁殖，不必每年施放。它可以说是理想中的“万年肥”。
    在外国进行蓝藻固氮作用研究的：有英、美、日本和印度等，其中以日本成就最大。近半年来，中国科学院水生生物研究所在湖北、湖南和江西等地采集了不少标本，并进行了各种试验工作，已经找到四种固氮蓝藻。其中一种念珠藻（686号），固氮能力最高，在100毫升缺氮培养基中，在灭菌条件下，生长繁殖四天的固氮量为1.01毫克。蓝藻的固氮量是除去接入的蓝藻数量外，计算其增长的数量和缺氮培养基中增加的氮量的总和。在一般试验过程中，经过灭菌处理，蓝藻在开始时是繁殖较慢的。但是，我们的固氮蓝藻在最初四天就长得很快，若是繁殖六十天后，固氮量将显著地超过目前世界最高水平。
    中共安丰乡委创办理论刊物
    中共江苏省兴化县安丰乡委主办的“解放思想”杂志于10月创刊了。它是以基层干部为主要对象的通俗的理论刊物。它是兴化县全县第一个由乡委主办的理论刊物。“解放思想”的任务是：宣传马列主义和毛泽东思想，批判各种资产阶级的思想观点，宣传党的总路线和各项方针政策；总结和推广先进经验，阐述社会主义制度和人民公社的优越性；集中地反映社会主义建设成就和新的社会面貌。
    “解放思想”创刊号共九篇文章，主要文章有乡委书记瞿加仕的“解放思想”发刊词和他与原唐港乡委副书记朱庭珍合作的“唐港片拔白旗插红旗”；中央文化部下放干部徐秉让的“人民公社好”，安丰小学教师窦瑞庆的“一个振奋人心的宏伟规划”等文章。“解放思想”杂志半月出刊一期，油印十六开本，文章形式短小精干，生动活泼，内容通俗易懂。
