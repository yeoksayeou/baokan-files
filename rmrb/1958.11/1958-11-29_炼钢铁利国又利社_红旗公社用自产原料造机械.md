Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Electric Dispatch: The Hongqi People's Commune in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, uses the iron and steel it produces itself to manufacture a large number of farm tools and machines, powerfully supporting the commune's agricultural production and various construction projects.

The Hongqi People's Commune's monthly iron and steel output is now sufficient for the commune to manufacture all kinds of farm tools and machinery for a year. In addition to fulfilling the state's upward transfer tasks this year, they can also allocate a lot more iron and steel to manufacture various farm tools. Since the large-scale iron and steel production campaign began, the commune's farm tool repair and manufacturing plant has used its own produced iron and steel to make two indigenous lathes, indigenous rails and an indigenous locomotive, as well as threshing machines, sweet potato slicers, earth excavators, double-furrow plows, deep plows, large shovels, and sickles.

The commune members, seeing the iron they had personally smelted turned into steel, and then into various machines and farm tools, and using them themselves, were all overjoyed, further boosting their enthusiasm for large-scale iron and steel production and striving for even greater agricultural harvests. Beside the steelmaking furnace, almost every day, commune members who had just finished work gathered around. Unable to rest, they enthusiastically rushed to the furnace to watch the tapping of the steel, some helping the steelmaking commune members pull the bellows, and some swinging iron hammers to help hammer the steel. Male commune members went to the iron and steel front, increasing the amount of farm work for female commune members, but they did not complain, but rather said with full enthusiasm: Now we work hard for a while, and in the future, when we have iron and steel, and make our own machines, our labor will become lighter and lighter.

Recently, the Commune Party Committee and the Commune Affairs Management Committee, based on the development of iron and steel production throughout the commune, further made plans to use the daily output of iron and steel to make farm tools and machinery.

    炼钢铁利国又利社
    红旗公社用自产原料造机械
    新华社合肥电　安徽省怀远县红旗人民公社用自己生产的钢铁制造了大量农具和机器，有力地支持了社内农业生产和各项建设。
    红旗人民公社目前一个月的钢铁产量，就够本社制造各种农具、机械用一年。他们今年除完成国家上调任务以外，还可以多下很多钢铁用来制造各种农具。自从大办钢铁以来，社里的农具修配制造厂已经用自己生产的钢铁制成了两部土车床，制成了土铁轨和土火车头，还制成了打稻机、山芋切片机、挖土机、双铧犁、深耕犁和大锹、镰刀等。
    社员们看到亲手炼出的铁变成了钢，又变成了各种机械和农具，并且亲手使用，个个都兴高采烈，进一步鼓起了大搞钢铁和争取农业更大丰收的干劲。在炼钢炉边，几乎每天都有才下工的社员团团围在那里，他们顾不了休息，都热情地赶到炉前去看出钢，有的帮助炼钢的社员拉风箱，有的抡起铁锤帮助锤钢。男社员上了钢铁战线，给女社员增加了不少农活，但是她们并不叫苦，反而干劲十足地说：现在苦干一下，将来有了钢铁，自造机器，我们的劳动就越来越轻快了。
    最近公社党委和社务管理委员会根据全社钢铁生产发展的情况，进一步作出了利用日产钢铁制作农具机械的规划。
