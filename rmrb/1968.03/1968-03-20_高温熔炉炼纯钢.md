High-Temperature Furnace Refines Pure Steel

Representative of the Model Workers Studying Chairman Mao's Works Conference of the Railway Engineering Corps, Political Instructor of the 16th Company of a Certain Unit, Zheng Lianzhang

Last year, we were tasked with constructing a railway tunnel in the scorching southern region. The company was stationed in a river valley surrounded by towering mountains on two sides. We often had to work in high temperatures, making it difficult for the soldiers to eat and sleep. The intense heat brought immense challenges to the construction work. The working face of the tunnel was small, and the deeper we went, the less air circulation there was, making it extremely hot and humid, like a steamer. As soon as we entered, it was not just about laboring; even standing for a few minutes would make us sweat profusely. Many comrades would feel dizzy and weak after a short period of work, with their limbs feeling powerless and their chests feeling stuffed with cotton. However, all the comrades in the company regarded overcoming the scorching heat as a good battlefield for tempering their selfless spirit. Everyone said, "High-temperature furnaces refine pure steel; the hotter it is, the more we can fight against selfishness," and "To build a world revolutionary base, not only do we not fear the tunnel being like a steamer, but we are also ready to jump into boiling oil!"

The boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong are the best weapons for breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit, and for overcoming the scorching heat. Everyone used Mao Zedong Thought to guide the battle, drilling a row of holes, pushing a cart of rubble, and blocking a collapse, all requiring a comparison with the "Old Three Articles" to fight against selfishness. The hotter the weather, the greater the enthusiasm; the harder the stones, the firmer the will. As the tunnel extended, the soldiers' selfless spirit became more solid, and the construction progress became faster and faster.

The deeper the tunnel went, the hotter the weather became, and the greater the construction difficulties. When it became unbearably hot, everyone would read Chairman Mao's quotations: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by them." "Resolve to fight, dare to sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Some comrades fainted but, upon hearing Chairman Mao's teachings, they got up, went to the ventilation machine to blow some wind, drank a bowl of bean milk, and continued the battle. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the construction progress became faster and faster. All the comrades in the company had a higher level of selfless spirit, and together with the brother companies, they completed their tasks ahead of schedule every month, maintaining stable and high production. At the year-end evaluation, more than 80% of the comrades in the company were awarded or evaluated as Five-Good Soldiers.

　　高温熔炉炼纯钢
　　铁道兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表  某部十六连指导员  郑连章
    去年，我们在炎热的南方担负铁路隧道施工任务。连队住在一个两面高山耸立的河谷里，常常在高温的情况下进行施工，战士们吃不下饭，睡不好觉。酷暑给施工带来了极大的困难。导坑里工作面小，越往里进，空气越不流通，又闷又热，象个蒸笼。乍到里面，不用说劳动，就是站上一二十分钟，便会汗流浃背。不少同志劳动一会儿就头晕眼花，四肢无力，胸中象塞了棉花一样难受。但是，全连同志把战胜炎热酷暑当作磨练自己一心为公思想的好战场。大家说：“高温熔炉炼纯钢，越炎热越好斗私心”，“为了建设世界革命根据地，不要说隧道里象个蒸笼，就是油锅我们也敢下去打个滚！”
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是破私立公、战胜炎热最好的武器。大家用毛泽东思想指挥战斗，打一排炮眼，推一车石碴，堵一次塌方，都要对照“老三篇”，狠斗一次私心。天越热，干劲越大；石头越硬，意志越坚。随着隧道的伸展，指战员们一心为公的思想越来越牢固，施工进度也越来越快。
    隧道越打越深，天气越来越热，施工困难越来越大。实在热得不得了，大家就朗读毛主席语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”有的同志晕倒了，听到毛主席的教导，爬起来跑到通风机口吹吹风，喝碗豆浆，又继续战斗。在毛泽东思想的指引下，施工进度越来越快，全连同志一心为公的思想境界越来越高，和兄弟连队一起，月月超额完成任务，保持了稳产高产。年终总评，全连百分之八十以上的同志立了功或被评为五好战士。
