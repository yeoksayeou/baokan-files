	Finding Joy in Hardship and Honoring It
	— Criticizing the Bourgeois Hedonism of China's Khrushchev

	Willing to Be Anonymous Heroes Who Seek Out Hardship

	Huang Yao Wei, Platoon Leader of a Certain Unit: China's Khrushchev shouts about how "life in the wilderness is tough," and "you will suffer, but others will know, you suffer first and reap the benefits later." This is a great insult to us revolutionary soldiers. We carry out missions, living in the mountains and huts for long periods, spending the whole day with shovels, pickaxes, stones, and soil. Our hands are calloused, our shoulders are swollen, and we are dirty and tired, but no one feels that "life in the wilderness is tough." No one tries to suffer a little to gain some "benefit." We all have one common wish: to bury the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries early and liberate all humanity. Every stone we strike is like eliminating one American imperialist; every shovel of dirt we dig is like building a tomb for imperialism and revisionism. To complete the tasks given to us by Chairman Mao, even if we have to walk on swords and tread on fire, we fear nothing. No matter how great the hardship, we can endure it. We are willing to be anonymous heroes for life.

	Chen Da Li, Deputy Political Instructor of a Certain Unit: Revolutionary soldiers join the revolution following Chairman Mao's teachings to serve the Chinese and world people wholeheartedly. The tougher it is, the more we can endure; the harder it is, the more we can overcome. Our soldiers, such as Qi Zong Shu, worked in the river to build roads, soaking his feet until they rotted, and his shoes fell apart. Leaders repeatedly advised him to rest, but he refused. He said, "Comrade Jiao Yu Lu dedicated himself to revolution, refusing to rest until he changed the face of Lan Kiao; for the revolution, I will not rest until I complete the road construction task." Soldier Zhou Fu Ding sought out hardship for the revolution, carrying six baskets of stones while others carried two; during tight construction tasks, he often worked alone at night and did not rest on holidays. Soldiers composed a song about this spirit of defiance: "A red sun warms our hearts, endless strength rolls in, fearing neither treacherous mountains nor evil waters, soldiers wave their hands and open the heavens and earth." The China's Khrushchev, who preaches that "suffering a little hardship will eventually bring great benefits," is like a rat crossing the street in the eyes of the heroic engineering troops armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

	For the People, Hardship is Our Nature

	Yan Zhi Yi, Deputy Platoon Leader of a Certain Unit: Chairman Mao teaches us to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people. A Communist's heart should be focused on "public" matters, and his efforts should be directed towards "public" causes. As long as the work is beneficial to the revolution and the people, no matter how tough it is, I will do it. Whether it's construction, kitchen duty, or labor in the countryside, regardless of scorching heat, severe cold, wind, or rain, I fear neither hardship, fatigue, nor injury. I have only one thought: to eliminate imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries early and liberate all oppressed people worldwide. I have never thought that personal suffering is a loss, nor have I ever considered future "great benefits," "respect," or personal "prospects."

	Si Zeng Shan, Political Instructor of a Certain Unit: We are revolutionary soldiers nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, with "public" ideals in our minds and "public" blood flowing in our veins. We endure hardship for the world revolution and the liberation of humanity, finding joy in hardship; we endure hardship for building socialism and communism, honoring hardship; we endure hardship to defend Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, finding sweetness in hardship. Even in construction, we carry bags of cement on our shoulders for years, with rolling sweat on our bodies. Our necks are burned, our throats are swollen, our waists are sore, our backs are aching, and our legs are swelling. But comrades proudly say, "Enduring hardship for the people is our nature. We endure hardship for one purpose—to liberate the world's people, not for personal gain." In China's Khrushchev's view, enduring hardship is the "means," and enjoying benefits is the "end." This is purely the decadent philosophy of the bourgeoisie, "if you don't seek personal gain, you will be punished by heaven and earth." We must thoroughly criticize and expose his reactionary fallacies.

	For Great Public Causes, Endure Great Hardships and Tolerate Great Fatigue

	Zhao Zhen Cang, Cook Squad Leader of a Certain Unit: China's Khrushchev spreads the fallacy that "suffering a little hardship will eventually bring great benefits," which is a poisonous pill to corrupt revolutionary soldiers and party members. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Suffer first and enjoy later." I do as Chairman Mao says. I have been a cook since I enlisted, choosing the dirty and tiring job of stoking the fire, dealing with coal, smoke, and ash all day; even after becoming a deputy squad leader, I still stoke the fire, and as a squad leader, I continue to stoke the fire. For four years, I have been stoking the fire for four years. I consider enduring more hardship as a support for the world people's revolution, and saving a little coal as a contribution to the world people. The fire I stoke is the fire of revolution, burning the rotten branches of the old world, liberating the people, and destroying imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. As long as the Chinese revolution and world revolution need it, I am willing to be a cook for life, using Mao Zedong Thought to make the revolutionary fire burn brighter and stronger, burning China's Khrushchev and his peddled bourgeois worldview to ashes.

	Lu Ji Lan, Mechanical Section Head of a Certain Unit: Doing revolution means being prepared to endure great hardship and being willing to endure it. Over the past decade, I have followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "Hard work is like a burden in front of us, see if we dare to bear it," overcoming the difficulties of low cultural level and low technical skills, innovating dozens or hundreds of times, never complaining or feeling tired. Once, during a downhill tunnel operation, water could not be drained, the construction progress was continuously delayed, and comrades' health was affected. I was very anxious. Together with the soldiers, we finally found the cause and decided to try making a new type of water pump. The news spread, and someone said to me, "If this problem could be solved, experts would have solved it long ago. Don't suffer in vain." We didn't care about that. We worked during the day and at night. When it was deep into the night and cold, we recited Chairman Mao's quotations. When we were tired, we poured cold water on ourselves. Several times, I fainted in the water due to overwork, but after being helped up by comrades, I continued to work. Due to being in the water for too long, my lower body was swollen, and my joints were inflamed, but I endured the pain and continued to work. Finally, we successfully made the water pump, drained the accumulated water, accelerated the construction progress, ensured comrades' health, and I was overjoyed. I think being able to contribute to the revolution is the greatest happiness.

	Gao Jing Fu, Cook Squad Leader of a Certain Unit: China's Khrushchev says, "Honest people suffer a little now and will succeed in the end." This is a typical merchant's business philosophy. After enlisting, I have been feeding pigs and stoking the fire, circling the stove for ten whole years. I firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Let others enjoy, and I will bear the heavy burden." I feed pigs and stoke the fire for the people's service, never thinking about personal "success" or "benefits." Some comrades say, "Old Gao, don't feed the pigs anymore. The pigs are fat, and you are thin." I think, as long as comrades can eat well and do the revolution well, I don't mind being thin. I will not fall for China's Khrushchev's trick of "suffering first and enjoying later." My heart beats for "loyalty," and my blood circulates for "public" causes; I am willing to endure hardship for the revolution for life and be a cook for the people for life.

	For the Revolution, Enduring Hardship is Loyalty to Chairman Mao

	Gong Chun Ju, Soldier of a Certain Unit: Chairman Mao teaches us to be "selfless" and "wholeheartedly serve the people." This is our revolutionary soldiers' vow. I feed pigs for the revolution, participate in construction, and am not afraid of bleeding and sweating, willingly enduring the greatest hardship. In June 1965, there was an urgent matter at home, and a letter came asking me to return. I thought that personal matters, no matter how big, are small matters, and revolutionary matters, no matter how small, are big matters. I must not forget the public for the private or drop the big for the small. For the revolution, no matter whether it is within or outside my duties, I volunteer to do it. I feed pigs during the day and participate in construction at night, sometimes working for sixteen consecutive hours without rest or food. I think of the fact that most laboring people in the world are still not liberated. To revolutionize, no hardship is hard, and no difficulty is difficult. China's Khrushchev preaches "suffering first" to "enjoy later," attempting to lead us to the path of seeking personal fame and fortune, betraying the revolution. We will not be deceived.

	Geng De Cheng, Soldier of a Certain Unit: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Suffer first and enjoy later. Such comrades are good comrades." I am weak, and during the execution of the camp construction mission, my back was injured. I don't feel the hardship. Today, we suffer for the revolution's needs, for the realization of communism, and for the liberation of humanity. Being able to endure hardship for the revolution is the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao. China's Khrushchev vigorously promotes the decadent philosophy of "suffering first and enjoying later," which is a great betrayal of the world's revolutionary people. We revolutionary soldiers have "loyalty" in our hearts, work hard with our heads down, endure hardship on our bodies, and find joy in our hearts.

    以苦为乐　以苦为荣
    ——痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级苦乐观
    甘当专找苦吃的无名英雄
    某部班长黄耀维：中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚷什么“野外生活是苦的”，“你们受了苦，人家会知道的，你们吃苦在前，得利在后”。这是对我们革命战士莫大的侮辱。我们执行任务，长期住山沟、草棚，整天和圆锹、十字镐、石头、泥土打交道，手磨破了，肩压肿了，又脏又累，但没有一个人感到“野外生活是苦的”，更没有人企图受点苦，想得到什么“利”。大家只有一个共同心愿：早日埋葬帝、修、反，解放全人类。我们多打一块石头，就算多消灭一个美帝强盗；多挖一锹土，就等于多给帝国主义、修正主义筑了一个坟墓。为了完成毛主席交给我们的任务，哪怕上刀山，下火海，我们也无所畏惧，天大的苦我们也能吃。我们愿当一辈子无名英雄。
    某部副政治指导员程大礼：革命战士参加革命，就是按照毛主席的教导，全心全意地为中国和世界人民服务，越苦越能吃，越难越能上。我们部队战士祁樟树同志在河里捞石筑路，脚泡烂了，鞋穿不上，领导同志多次劝他休息，他坚决不肯。他说：“焦裕禄同志为革命，不改变兰考面貌死不瞑目；为了革命，我不完成筑路任务死不甘心。”战士周福定同志为革命专找苦吃，挑石头别人一次挑两筐，他一次挑六筐；工程任务紧张时，他常常夜间一个人去工地干活，假日也不休息。战士们把这种战天斗地的豪情壮志编成歌谣：“一轮红日暖胸怀，无穷力量滚滚来，险山恶水何所惧，战士挥手天地开。”宣扬“吃点小苦头”最后“得大便宜”的中国赫鲁晓夫，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的工程兵战士面前，只是一只人人喊打的过街老鼠。
        为人民吃苦是我们的本色
    某部副班长鄢志益：毛主席教导我们要“完全”、
  “彻底”为人民服务。一个共产党员的心应该往“公”字上想，劲应该往“公”字上使。只要是对革命、对人民有利的工作，再苦我也干，施工、帮厨、到农村劳动，不管酷暑严寒风雨大，苦累伤病都不怕。我只有一个念头，就是早日消灭帝、修、反，解放全世界被压迫人民。我从没想到个人吃苦是吃了亏，更没想过将来还要得什么“大便宜”，受什么“尊敬”，追求什么个人的“前途”。
    某部政治指导员司增山：我们是毛泽东思想哺育的革命战士，头脑里刻的是“公”字的思想，周身流通的是“公”字的血液。我们为世界革命，为人类解放事业而吃苦，视苦为乐；为建设社会主义和共产主义而吃苦，以苦为荣；为保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的革命路线而吃苦，以苦为甜。我们连在施工中，长年累月是“袋袋水泥肩上扛，滚滚汗水身上淌，脖子烧破喉呛肿，腰酸背痛腿发胀”。但是同志们豪迈地说：“为人民吃苦是我们的本色。我们吃苦只有一个目的——为世界人民翻身解放，决不是为个人。”在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，吃苦是“本”，“享福”是“利”，吃苦是手段，享福得利是目的，这纯粹是资产阶级“人不为己，天诛地灭”的腐朽哲学。我们要彻底批臭他的反动谬论。
          为了大公吃大苦耐大劳
    某部炊事班长赵振仓：中国赫鲁晓夫散布“吃点小的苦头，但最后是得大便宜的”的谬论，是毒害革命战士、腐蚀党员的一服毒药。毛主席教导我们：“吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头”。毛主席咋说我咋做，我把为革命吃苦当作最大的幸福。一入伍我就当炊事员，选了又脏又累的烧火工作，整天和煤、烟、灰打交道；当了副班长我仍然烧火，当了班长我还是烧火，当四年兵我烧了四年火。我把自己多吃一点苦当作对世界人民革命的一分支援，把多节约一两煤当作对世界人民的一点贡献。我烧的是革命的火，是烧尽旧世界朽木枯枝的火，是使人民翻身解放的火，是使帝、修、反灭亡的火。只要中国革命和世界革命需要，我愿当一辈子炊事员，用毛泽东思想把革命的炉火烧得更红更旺，把中国赫鲁晓夫和他所贩卖的资产阶级世界观烧死、烧焦，化为灰烬。
    某部机械股长吕纪兰：干革命就要准备吃大苦，要乐于吃大苦。十几年来，我按照毛主席“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担”的教导，克服文化程度不高，技术水平低的困难，几十次、几百次搞革新，从不叫苦，从不喊累。有一次，下坡坑道作业，水排不出，工程进度不断下降，同志们身体健康受影响，自己心里十分焦急。我同战士们一起，终于找到了原因，并决定试制一种新式水泵。消息传开，有人对我说：“如果这个问题能解决，专家早解决了，你不要白讨苦吃。”我们不管那一套，白天干，晚上也干。夜深了，天冷了，就背毛主席语录，疲劳了就用凉水浇一浇。有几次劳累过度，我晕倒在水里，同志们扶起来后，我还是继续干。由于在水里泡的时间太长，下身浮肿，关节发炎，我忍着痛，坚持工作。最后终于试制成了水泵，排除了积水，工程进度加快了，同志们身体健康有了保证，我心里乐滋滋的。我认为能够为革命作一点贡献，就是最大的快乐。
    某部炊事班长高敬甫：中国赫鲁晓夫说：“老实人，现在吃一点亏，最后会成功的。”这是典型的投机商人的生意经。我入伍后一直喂猪、烧火，围着锅台转，整整十年。我牢记毛主席的教导：“享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑”。我喂猪、烧火，是为人民服务，从没想过什么个人的“成功”、“得利”。有的同志说：“老高，你别喂猪了，猪喂肥了，你也累瘦了。”我想，只要同志们能吃饱吃好，好好干革命，我个人瘦点怕啥。我决不上中国赫鲁晓夫“吃苦在前，得利在后”的当。我的心脏要为“忠”字跳动，血液要为“公”字循环；我愿为革命吃一辈子苦，为人民当一辈子炊事员。
    为革命吃苦　就是对毛主席的忠
    某部战士龚纯菊：毛主席教导我们要“大公无私”，“全心全意地为人民服务”。这就是我们革命战士的志愿。我为革命喂猪，参加施工，不怕流血流汗，经受最大的艰苦都心甘情愿。一九六五年六月，家里有急事，来信要我回去，我想个人的事再大是小事，革命的事再小是大事，我决不能为私忘公，为小事丢大事。为革命，不管分内分外的工作，我都抢着干，白天喂猪，晚上参加施工，有时一连十六个小时不休息、不吃饭。我想到世界上大部分劳动人民还没有解放，要革命，再大的苦也不苦，再大的难也不难。中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬“吃苦在前”，是为了“得利在后”，这是妄图把我们引向追求个人名利，背叛革命的邪路上去，我们决不上当。
    某部战士耿德成：毛主席教导我们：“吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。”我身体弱，执行营建任务中，背压伤了，我不觉得苦。我们今天吃苦，是革命的需要，是实现共产主义的需要，是人类解放事业的需要。能为革命吃大苦，就是对毛主席最大的忠。中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹“吃苦在前，得利在后”的腐朽哲学，这是对世界革命人民最大的背叛。我们革命战士心怀“忠”字，埋头苦干，苦在身上，乐在心间。
