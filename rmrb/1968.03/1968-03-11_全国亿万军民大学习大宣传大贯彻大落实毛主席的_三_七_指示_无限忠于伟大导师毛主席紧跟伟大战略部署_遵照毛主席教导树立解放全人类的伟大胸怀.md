In the midst of the nationwide military and civilian masses' great march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a wave of studying, publicizing, implementing, and ensuring the realization of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as outlined in his March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions, is sweeping across the country more extensively and deeply. Revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers across the country are expressing their revolutionary enthusiasm, vowing to uphold the "loyalty" of the proletariat, to be loyal to the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, to be loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to be loyal to Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, to be loyal to the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, and to be loyal to the Central Cultural Revolution Group.

In recent days, the military and civilian masses across the country, with profound proletarian emotions of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty towards Chairman Mao, have repeatedly reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The army should, in stages and batches, conduct military training for universities, middle schools, and high-grade primary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, reorganizing organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership bodies, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Start with pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually expand. Also, persuade students to implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself, and during military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes. Except for the elderly and the sick, let these people participate to facilitate their reform. All these problems can be solved as long as they are done seriously."

The military and civilian masses across the country have expressed their determination to follow the great strategic deployment of the great teacher, Chairman Mao, to further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions, one must raise the consciousness of class struggle and line struggle to a higher level.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no room for compromise on the line issue."

Revolutionary masses and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Henan, Gansu, Hebei, Jilin, and other places, with hearts full of infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have been studying and deeply understanding the spirit of Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions. The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army executing the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks in Beijing said that whether or not to implement Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions is a mark of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, an attitude issue, a stance issue, and a principle issue of which line one stands on. Fully implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions is the fundamental stance, the highest consciousness, the greatest principle, the purest party spirit, and the greatest loyalty of proletarian revolutionaries. The soldiers and officers participating in military and political training in the Shanghai Garrison reviewed their fighting journey over the past year and deeply felt that helping the broad revolutionary teachers and students establish a firm "loyalty" to Chairman Mao in their minds is the fundamental guarantee and purpose of implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students of the "May 7th Commune" (formerly Shanghai Jiaotong University) practicing the proletarian educational revolution scheme on the construction site, upon reviewing Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive, felt even more deeply. They said that implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions is a major issue related to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a major issue related to cultivating and fostering successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, a matter of great importance for a hundred years, a thousand years, and ten thousand years. Every step we take is permeated with the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. We must hold high the banner of Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and May 7th Directive, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and strive to establish a brand-new proletarian educational system. The broad soldiers and officers executing military and political training tasks in the schools of the Guiyang region expressed their determination to temper their hearts of infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao in the great struggle of implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions.

To be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions, one must carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be proficient in it and apply it. The purpose of being proficient is entirely for application."

The military and civilian masses across the country have deeply felt from the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and more that to comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions, one must have a "loyalty" to the great leader Chairman Mao and fully carry forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao himself. They pointed out that loyalty is shown through actions. Whether to use or not to use Chairman Mao's instructions is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao, a fundamental attitude issue towards Mao Zedong Thought. In recent days, many regions, many factories, schools, stores, and organizations have held mass meetings to further implement Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions, emphasizing the need to further carry forward Chairman Mao's revolutionary academic style and continue to establish and run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well. The broad workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and People's Liberation Army leftist support personnel must take immediate action with the most enthusiastic political passion and the most effective measures to further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions. The Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province's School Work Leading Group issued a decision to the primary, secondary, and tertiary schools across the province on further implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive, requiring the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff across the province to, with the strongest will, the highest enthusiasm, the greatest effort, and the fastest speed, launch a new learning high tide, establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and foster a revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice.

The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army and the broad revolutionary masses in Qinghai, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and other places, with a heart full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, further study and apply Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions, determined to learn to a new level and apply to a new level. The revolutionary teachers and students of various primary and secondary schools in Hohhot have been holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in recent days, determined to raise the revolutionary great criticism to a new level, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and further do a good job in the struggle for class education. The revolutionary committees of some primary, secondary, and tertiary schools in the Xining region, along with the revolutionary teachers and students and the People's Liberation Army responsible for military training, seriously compared with the March 7th Directive, studied and revised the plan for the struggle for class education. The revolutionary teachers and students of Huazhong Institute of Technology, one of the earliest establishments of the revolutionary committee in the tertiary institutions of the Wuhan region, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings of "only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself" and "correctly treating cadres," liberated a large number of revolutionary cadres.

To be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions, one must continuously enhance proletarian party spirit and raise revolutionary vigilance.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is necessary to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the revolutionary track of the proletariat. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The broad military and civilian masses across the country have deeply felt from the struggle practice over the past year that to comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions, one must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, thoroughly overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, eliminate the poison of anarchism, continuously enhance proletarian party spirit, enhance the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, arm the masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and form a highly proletarianized, highly combat-ready, and steely united revolutionary army. The Red Guards of the Red Revolutionary Committee of the capital's middle schools said that they must overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, eliminate interference from the right or ultra-"left" sides, and resolutely smash the plots of the class enemies to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On March 7th, all 24 full-time higher education institutions in Shanghai established revolutionary committees, achieving a sea of red. The broad revolutionary teachers and students once again reviewed Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive, feeling more intimate and clearer in direction the more they studied. They are determined, in the great struggle of further comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of his latest instructions, to be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to be loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to be loyal to Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, to be loyal to the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, and to be loyal to the Central Cultural Revolution Group.

The broad military and civilian masses across the country, while further studying and implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and discussing the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and educational revolution, always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle." They said: A handful of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders are attempting to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must "not be too naive to simplify the complex class struggle." We must better grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this most powerful ideological weapon, and heighten our vigilance a hundredfold. We must permeate the thought of firmly grasping class struggle and line struggle into all aspects and fields of political life and social life, analyze and identify the new characteristics and trends of class struggle and line struggle, keep our eyes sharp, stand firm, resolutely defend the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, protect military-civilian unity like protecting our eyes, resolutely defend the newly born revolutionary committees, thoroughly smash all the sabotage plots of the class enemies, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    据新华社十日讯　在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大进军中，一个大学习、大宣传、大贯彻、大落实毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命伟大战略部署的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的热潮，正在各地更加广泛深入地展开。各地无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员，满怀革命豪情地表示一定要突出无产阶级的“忠”字，忠于无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，忠于毛主席的最亲密战友林副主席，忠于以毛主席为首的党中央，忠于中央文革。
    这几天，各地亿万军民怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情，一遍又一遍地重温了毛主席的伟大教导：“军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。先作试点，取得经验，逐步推广。还要说服学生，实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导，在军训时不要排斥犯错误的教师和干部。除老年和生病的以外，要让这些人参加，以利改造。所有这些，只要认真去做，问题并不难解决。”各地军民表示，一定要紧跟伟大导师毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    无限忠于毛主席，进一步全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，就要把阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟提得高高的
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”
      北京、上海、天津、贵州、江西、河南、甘肃、河北、吉林等地广大革命群众和解放军指战员，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心，连日来反复学习、认真领会毛主席“三·七”指示的精神，把对待毛主席的这一光辉指示和一系列最新指示的态度问题提到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度来认识。在北京执行“三支”“两军”任务的解放军指战员们说，对毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示执行不执行，是忠不忠于伟大领袖毛主席的标志，是态度问题，立场问题，是站在哪条路线上的原则问题。条条落实、全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，是无产阶级革命战士最根本的立场，最高的觉悟，最大的原则，最纯的党性，最大的忠。上海警备区参加军政训练的指战员们回顾一年来的战斗历程，深深体会到，帮助广大革命师生在头脑里大树对毛主席的“忠”字，是落实毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的根本保证和根本目的。正在工地上实践无产阶级教育革命方案的“五·七”公社（原上海同济大学）的革命师生，重温毛主席的“三·七”指示，感受更深。他们说，落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，是关系到无产阶级文化大革命取得全面胜利的大问题，是关系到培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的大问题，是百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。我们每前进一步都贯串着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。我们一定要更高地举起毛主席“三·七”指示和“五·七”指示的光辉旗帜，彻底摧毁中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，为建立一个崭新的无产阶级教育制度而奋斗。在贵阳地区大中学校执行军政训练任务的广大指战员表示，一定要在落实毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的伟大斗争中，锤炼无限忠于毛主席的红心。
    无限忠于毛主席，进一步全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新  指示，就要发扬毛主席倡导的革命学风
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”
    各地军民从一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中深深体会到，要全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，必须对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，充分发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风。他们指出，忠不忠，看行动。对于毛主席的指示用还是不用，是对毛主席忠不忠的大问题，是对毛泽东思想的根本态度问题。连日来，很多地区，很多工厂、学校、商店和机关的革命委员会和广大革命群众，为了进一步落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，在“用”字上狠下功夫，更加广泛深入地展开了大学习、大宣传、大检查、大总结的群众性活动。
    山东省革命委员会和广东省革命委员会、广州市革命委员会分别举行了进一步落实毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的群众大会，强调要进一步发扬毛主席倡导的革命学风，继续大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班。广大工人、贫下中农、革命师生员工、革命干部和革命的知识分子以及人民解放军支左人员，都要立即行动起来，以最饱满的政治热情，采取最有效的措施，把毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示进一步全面落实到行动中。贵州省革命委员会学校工作领导小组向全省大中小学校发出了关于进一步贯彻伟大领袖毛主席“三·七”指示的决定，要求全省广大革命师生员工，以最坚强的毅力，最高的热情，最大的干劲，最快的速度，大张旗鼓地掀起新的学习高潮，大办毛泽东思想学习班，大树理论联系实际的革命学风。
    青海、湖北、内蒙古、新疆、黑龙江、湖南、山西、江苏、宁夏、陕西等地解放军指战员和广大革命群众，怀着对毛主席的一片忠心，进一步活学活用毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，决心学出新水平，用出新水平。呼和浩特各大中小学革命师生连日来纷纷举办毛泽东思想学习班，决心把革命的大批判提高到新水平，巩固和发展革命大联合、革命三结合，进一步搞好复课闹革命。西宁地区一些大、中、小学校的革委会、革命师生和担负军训工作的解放军一起，认真对照“三·七”指示，研究和修订了复课闹革命的计划。武汉地区大专院校成立革命委员会较早的华中工学院全体革命师生，在毛主席“三·七”指示的指引下，遵照毛主席“只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己”的教导和“正确地对待干部”的教导，解放了大批革命干部。
    无限忠于毛主席，进一步全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，就要不断增强无产阶级党性，就要提高革命警惕性
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”
    各地广大军民从一年来的斗争实践中深切体会到，要全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，就必须遵循毛主席的教导，彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，肃清无政府主义的流毒，不断加强无产阶级党性，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装群众，组成一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的、钢铁般团结的革命大军。首都中学红代会的红卫兵小将说，我们一定要克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，排除来自右的或极“左”方面的干扰，坚决粉碎阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋。上海二十四所全日制高等院校三月七日全部成立革委会，实现了一片红。广大革命师生再一次重温毛主席的“三·七”指示，越学越感到亲切，越学方向越明。他们决心在进一步全面落实毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的伟大斗争中，做到忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，忠于毛主席的最亲密战友林副主席，忠于以毛主席为首的党中央，忠于中央文革。
    各地广大军民在进一步学习、落实毛主席的“三·七”指示，畅谈无产阶级文化大革命和教育革命的空前大好形势时，时刻牢记着毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导。他们说：一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子和死不悔改的走资派，妄图破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。我们“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了”。我们一定要更好地掌握毛泽东思想这个最强大的思想武器，百倍地提高警惕，把狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争的思想贯穿到政治生活和社会生活的一切领域、一切方面，分析、识别阶级斗争、路线斗争的新特点、新动向，擦亮眼睛，站稳立场，坚决捍卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，象保护眼珠一样维护军民团结，坚决捍卫新诞生的革命委员会，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的一切破坏阴谋，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
