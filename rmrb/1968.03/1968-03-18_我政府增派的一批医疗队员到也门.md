Another batch of Chinese medical personnel, sent by the Chinese government at the request of the Yemeni government, arrived in Yemen's second-largest city, Taiz, by plane on March 13.

They were warmly welcomed by the governor of Taiz Province and the directors of the health, foreign affairs, news, and finance offices in Taiz upon their arrival at Taiz Airport.

The first batch of Chinese medical personnel arrived in Yemen as early as July 1966. Over the past year, they have wholeheartedly served the Yemeni people in Sana'a, Ibb, and other places, earning high praise from the Yemeni government and people. During the recent battle to defend the Yemeni capital Sana'a and counter the armed subversion of the Yemeni Republican government by U.S. imperialism and the Saudi Arabian reactionaries, the Chinese medical team further demonstrated their high internationalist spirit. They rushed from the southern city of Ibb to Sana'a, working day and night amidst the roar of cannons to rescue wounded and sick soldiers from the front lines.

According to the request of the Yemeni government, the newly arrived Chinese medical team will work together with the original Chinese medical team in Sana'a, Taiz, and Ibb.

　　我政府增派的一批医疗队员到也门
    新华社萨那十五日电  中国政府应也门政府的要求，增派的另一批医疗队员，于十三日乘飞机到达也门第二大城市塔伊兹。
    他们在抵达塔伊兹机场时，受到塔伊兹省省长和卫生、外交、新闻、财政等部驻塔伊兹办公室主任的热情欢迎。
    第一批中国医疗队员早在一九六六年七月就来到也门。一年多来，他们在萨那、伊卜等地全心全意地为也门人民服务，受到也门政府和人民的高度赞扬。在这次也门人民保卫首都萨那、反击美帝国主义和沙特阿拉伯反动派武装颠覆也门共和政权的战斗中，中国医疗队进一步发扬高度的国际主义精神，特地从南部城市伊卜赶到萨那，在隆隆炮声中，日夜不停地抢救从前线下来的伤病员。
    按照也门政府的要求，这次新来的中国医疗队，将和原来的中国医疗队一起，在萨那、塔伊兹和伊卜三地工作。
