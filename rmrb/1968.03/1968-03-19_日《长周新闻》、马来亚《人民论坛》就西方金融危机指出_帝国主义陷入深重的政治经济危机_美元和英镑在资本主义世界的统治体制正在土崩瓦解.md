Tokyo, March 18 (New China News Agency) — The Japanese newspaper "Long Weekly News" published an editorial on March 17 on the financial crisis in the capitalist world, pointing out that U.S. imperialism is now being punished by history and is rapidly heading for collapse. The editorial says that the two most typical events marking the accelerated collapse of imperialism are: the U.S. imperialists being beaten black and blue by the heroic Vietnamese people in the Vietnam War, suffering a heavy defeat; and the dollar and pound sterling in the capitalist world's ruling system crumbling.

The editorial says that in the past, the U.S. and British imperialists used the dollar and pound sterling to control the economy of the capitalist world. However, recently, the British imperialists announced the devaluation of the pound sterling. Immediately afterward, the dollar crisis deepened. Now, the United States and Britain are scrambling to maintain the status of the dollar and pound sterling.

The editorial points out that the dollar crisis and the devaluation of the pound sterling indicate that the position of U.S. and British imperialism in the capitalist world has greatly declined.

The editorial points out that Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." The current situation of U.S. and British imperialism fully confirms Chairman Mao's wise judgment.

The editorial concludes by pointing out that U.S. imperialism and the Sato sellout government, as well as the Revisionist group led by Komoto, are now in a state of panic. A tragic fate awaits them all.

Singapore, March 18 (New China News Agency) — The organ of the Malayan People's Party, the "People's Forum," recently published an article pointing out that the current financial crisis in the capitalist world is an "earthquake" for imperialism, and the capitalist world monetary system, which is based on the dollar, is on the verge of collapse.

The article says that over the past year, the great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and the widespread propagation of Mao Zedong Thought worldwide have greatly promoted the anti-imperialist struggle of the revolutionary people of the world, placing imperialism and its lackeys in various countries in an even more difficult position, and exacerbating the contradictions among imperialists.

The article says that the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, has long pointed out: "The imperialist system is riddled with internal contradictions that cannot be overcome, plunging the imperialists into great distress." Over the past year, under the heavy blows of the surging revolutionary struggle of the people of the world and the great upheaval, reorganization, and realignment of political forces worldwide, imperialism, which is accelerating toward comprehensive collapse, has fallen into an even deeper political and economic crisis.

The article says that the devaluation of the pound sterling last November caused great turmoil in the entire capitalist world financial and monetary system, indicating that the capitalist world financial and monetary system, which uses the dollar and pound sterling as "reserve currencies," is already on the verge of collapse.

The article points out that the measures taken by U.S. imperialism to save the dollar crisis will only further expose the weakness of the dollar. The article says that after the devaluation of the pound sterling, the dollar has become even more unstable, and the instability of the dollar, in turn, affects the pound sterling. The measures taken by the United States and Britain to save the situation will not only have any effect but will inevitably make the struggle among Western countries to seize overseas markets more intense, greatly exacerbating the contradictions among imperialist countries.

　　日《长周新闻》、马来亚《人民论坛》就西方金融危机指出
　　帝国主义陷入深重的政治经济危机
　　美元和英镑在资本主义世界的统治体制正在土崩瓦解
    新华社十八日讯　东京消息：日本《长周新闻》十七日就资本主义世界的金融危机发表社论指出：美帝国主义现在正受到历史的惩罚，迅速地走向崩溃。社论说，标志着帝国主义加速走向崩溃的两个最典型事件是：美帝在侵越战争中被英雄的越南人民打得焦头烂额，遭到惨重的失败；美元和英镑在资本主义世界的统治体制陷于土崩瓦解。
    社论说，过去，美、英两个帝国主义用美元和英镑对资本主义世界的经济进行控制。但是，不久前英帝国主义宣布了英镑的贬值。紧接着，美元危机日益深重。现在，美国和英国为了维持美元和英镑的地位，正在疲于奔命。
    社论指出，美元危机和英镑贬值，表明美帝国主义和英帝国主义在资本主义世界的地位，大大地降低。
    社论指出，毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”美、英帝国主义目前的处境，完全证实了毛主席的这一英明论断。
    社论最后指出，美帝国主义和佐藤卖国政府以及宫本修正主义集团，现在都张惶失措，慌了手脚。等待着它们的，是共同的悲惨命运。
    新华社十八日讯　新加坡消息：马来亚政党新加坡人民党机关报《人民论坛》最近发表文章指出：目前资本主义世界的金融危机对帝国主义来说是一场“地震”，以美元为支柱的资本主义世界货币体系已经摇摇欲坠。
    文章说：一年多来，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利和毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播，大大促进了世界革命人民的反帝斗争，使帝国主义及其在各国的走狗处于更加困难的境地，使帝国主义之间的矛盾加剧。
    文章说：世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席早已指出：“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服，使帝国主义者陷入了极大的苦闷中。”过去一年中，在全世界人民汹涌澎湃的革命斗争浪潮的沉重打击下，在全世界各地政治力量大动荡、大分化、大改组的局面下，正在加速走向全面崩溃的帝国主义，陷入了更加深重的政治和经济危机。
    文章说：去年十一月英镑贬值引起了整个资本主义世界金融货币体系的极大混乱，表明以美元和英镑为“储备货币”的资本主义世界金融、货币体系，已经摇摇欲坠了。
    文章指出：美帝企图挽救美元危机的措施，只能进一步暴露美元的虚弱。文章说：英镑贬值后，美元愈加不稳，而美元的不稳，又反过来影响英镑。美英两国所采取的挽救措施，不仅不会产生任何实效，而且必然使西方世界各国争夺海外市场的斗争更趋剧烈，使帝国主义各国之间的矛盾大大加剧。
