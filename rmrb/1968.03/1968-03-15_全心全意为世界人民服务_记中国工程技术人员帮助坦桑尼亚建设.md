On the eve of the third anniversary of the signing of the China-Tanzania Friendship Treaty, a reporter visited some construction sites where China is assisting Tanzania. Guided by the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, Chinese engineering and technical personnel have made tremendous contributions to strengthening and developing the friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania through their diligent and effective labor. The Tanzanian people enthusiastically praise them as "good engineering and technical personnel sent by Chairman Mao."

Good Engineering and Technical Personnel Sent by Chairman Mao

In the suburbs of Dar es Salaam, in Ubungo, what was once a year ago a wild field overgrown with weeds has now become a large area of modern factory buildings. The 40,000-spindle textile printing and dyeing combined factory, the Tanzania Friendship Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, which China is helping Tanzania build, is nearing completion. This, the largest state-owned textile factory in Tanzania, is scheduled to be completed in July this year and is expected to produce 24 million square yards of cotton cloth annually for the cotton-producing people of Tanzania.

Chinese engineering and technical personnel, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, regard passing on technology to the Tanzanian people as their internationalist duty.

Chinese tin worker Tian Buyun is an old craftsman in his fifties. He is very enthusiastic about teaching Tanzanian young apprentices, personally guiding them until they master the skills. Those who have come into contact with him all praise him. Some say: "Only from the good engineering and technical personnel sent by Mao Zedong can we truly learn technology."

A worker said: "When I see the Chinese engineering and technical personnel working on the construction site, covered in mud, laboring alongside us, and selflessly imparting technology, I think: Tanzania has found the best friends."

A Model of Hard Work and Simplicity

When we arrived at the Ruvo State Farm, 50 miles from Dar es Salaam, and the Ubenaga Farm in the central part of Zanzibar Island, we saw vast tracts of fertile land plowed by tractors and small plots of vegetable, tobacco, and sugarcane experimental fields. Due to the joint efforts of Chinese engineering and technical personnel and Tanzanian workers, these two comprehensive state farms have already taken shape. By the end of this year, they will be basically completed and will produce grain and various agricultural and sideline products for the Tanzanian people.

Chinese engineering and technical personnel working on the farms enthusiastically responded to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They have withstood the test of the tropical heat, overcome one natural difficulty after another, and maintained abundant energy and enthusiasm.

In the dry season, they labored every day under the scorching equatorial sun, with sweat soaking their work clothes, blisters forming on their faces and backs, and peeling skin layer by layer. However, for two years, they have insisted on working eight hours a day in the fields. They say: "With Mao Zedong Thought, we are not afraid of the scorching sun for the sake of building Africa."

In the rainy season, they often work in the rain.

Chinese engineering and technical personnel live in simple wooden houses or sheds they built themselves in the wilderness all year round. Some Chinese engineering and technical personnel on the Ubenaga Farm in Zanzibar have lived in a small thatched hut made of scrap wood and coconut leaves for more than two years. They rarely go into the city on weekends or holidays, but stay on the farm to green the environment or engage in other labor.

The hardworking and simple style of the Chinese engineering and technical personnel has left a deep impression on the Tanzanian people. Tanzanian national leaders have repeatedly called on the people to learn from the good example of the hardworking and simple Chinese engineering and technical personnel.

Undaunted by Risks to Explore Coal Fields

Chinese engineering and technical personnel who went to Tanzania to survey coal and iron mines remembered Chairman Mao's teachings. They fearlessly overcame difficulties and dangers, crossed mountains and valleys to find mineral deposits for the Tanzanian people, and made positive contributions to the geological survey of Tanzania.

Chinese coal mine surveyors covered more than 6,000 miles in just four months, surveying more than ten coal fields. They went to areas where Western "experts" previously dared not go, where the terrain was steep and few people ventured. The coal reserves they explored in Tanzania were more than three times those surveyed by Western "experts."

On their way to survey a mine in the southern region, heavy tropical rain turned the dirt roads into a quagmire, making car travel dangerous at any moment. The Tanzanian friends accompanying the Chinese comrades suggested going to another place for the survey, considering the safety of the Chinese comrades. The Chinese surveyors, with a high sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for Tanzania's construction, reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They decided not to give up the mine area considered too dangerous by Western surveyors. They overcame countless difficulties, braved the rain, and walked for five days through high mountains, valleys, and treacherous roads to finally reach their destination.

In the wild, they always found ways to overcome one danger after another. They held hands to cross rapid currents, climbed vines down cliffs, and used human ladders to climb steep walls. They put personal safety aside and found one rich coal field after another for the Tanzanian people. They said: "We are geologists of the Mao Zedong era, fearing no danger for the benefit of the people of the world."

The Tanzanian people were moved and said to their Chinese friends: "From you, we see the noble qualities of the Chinese people." They shouted: "Long live China-Tanzania friendship! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" A Tanzanian worker who was about to leave the construction site held the hands of the Chinese engineering and technical personnel and said with reluctance: "During the time we spent together, I saw how good the Chinese engineering and technical personnel are as taught by Chairman Mao. Please convey my greetings to Chairman Mao when you return home. The Tanzanian people thank him."

### 全心全意为世界人民服务——记中国工程技术人员帮助坦桑尼亚建设

　　全心全意为世界人民服务
    ——记中国工程技术人员帮助坦桑尼亚建设
    在庆祝中国和坦桑尼亚友好条约签订三周年前夕，记者参观了中国援助坦桑尼亚修建的一些工程工地。中国工程技术人员根据伟大领袖毛主席的教导，以卓有成效的辛勤劳动为加强和发展中坦两国人民的友谊作出了巨大的贡献。坦桑尼亚人民热烈赞扬他们是“毛主席派来的好工程技术人员。”
    毛主席派来的好工程技术人员
    在达累斯萨拉姆市郊的乌邦果，一年多前还是一片杂草丛生的野地上，如今建立起了一大片现代化的厂房。中国援助坦桑尼亚修建的四万纱锭的纺织印染联合工厂——坦桑尼亚友谊纺织印染厂——已接近竣工。这所坦桑尼亚最大的国营纺织厂今年七月建成后，预计每年将为盛产棉花的坦桑尼亚人民生产两千四百万平方码的棉布。
    毛泽东思想哺育下的中国工程技术人员把向坦桑尼亚人民传授技术看作是应尽的国际主义义务。
    中国白铁工田步云是一位年逾半百的老技工。他对坦桑尼亚青年徒工十分热情，一个个把着手教，直到他们完全掌握技术为止。同他接触过的坦桑尼亚青年无不称赞他。有的说：“只有从毛泽东派来的好工程技术人员那里，我们才能真正学到技术”。
    一位工人说：“我一看见中国工程技术人员在工地上满身泥浆同我们一起劳动，无私地传授技术，我就想到：坦桑尼亚找到了最好的朋友。”
    艰苦朴素的好榜样
    当我们到达距达累斯萨拉姆市五十英里的鲁伏国营农场和桑给巴尔岛中部的乌本加农场时，我们看到拖拉机开垦出的大片肥沃土地和小块蔬菜、烟草、甘蔗试验田。由于中国工程技术人员和坦桑尼亚工人共同努力，这两个综合性的国营农场都已初具规模，到今年年底基本建成后将为坦桑尼亚人民生产粮食和多种农副产品。
    在农场工作的中国工程技术人员热烈响应林彪副主席的号召，努力学习毛主席著作，按照毛主席的指示办事。他们经受了热带酷暑的考验，战胜了大自然带来的一个又一个的困难，始终保持着充沛的干劲和热情。
    在旱季，他们天天在赤道烈日曝晒下劳动，汗水湿透了工作服，脸上、背膀上晒起了泡，灼伤的皮肤脱了一层又一层。但是，两年来他们一直坚持每天在田间劳动八小时。他们说：“有了毛泽东思想，为了非洲人民的建设，我们不怕赤日似火烤”。
    在雨季，他们经常冒雨劳动。
    中国工程技术人员在野外终年住的是自己动手盖的简单的木板房或工棚。桑给巴尔乌本加农场的一些中国工程技术人员，在一间用废木料和椰子树叶盖的矮小的茅屋里住了两年多。他们星期天或假日也很少进城，而是留在农场绿化环境或从事其它劳动。
    中国工程技术人员这种勤劳朴素的作风在坦桑尼亚人民心目中留下极其深刻的印象。坦桑尼亚国家领导人多次号召人民学习中国工程技术人员艰苦朴素的好榜样。
    不畏风险探煤田
    到坦桑尼亚考察煤矿和铁矿的中国工程技术人员牢记毛主席的教导，他们不畏艰难险阻，翻山越岭为坦桑尼亚人民找矿藏，对坦桑尼亚地质考察作出了积极贡献。
    中国煤矿考察工作人员在短短的四个月跑了六千多英里，对十多个煤田进行了考察。他们到过西方考察“专家”过去不敢去的地势陡峭人迹罕到的煤田区，他们勘探的坦桑尼亚储煤量同西方“专家”考察的储煤量比较超出三倍多。
    在赴南部某矿区考察途中，热带暴雨把土路冲得泥泞不堪，汽车行驶随时可能发生意外。陪同中国同志的坦桑尼亚朋友考虑到中国同志的安全，建议到另外的地方考察。中国考察人员对坦桑尼亚建设怀着高度的热情和责任感，他们重温了毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们决心不放弃这个被西方考察者认为地势险不能去的矿区。他们千方百计克服困难，冒着暴雨，在高山河谷和艰险的道路上走了五天，终于到达目的地。
    在野外考察中他们总是想尽办法越过一个又一个的险境。他们手挽手过急流、攀树藤下悬崖、搭人梯上峭壁。他们就是这样把个人安危置之度外，为坦桑尼亚人民找到了一个又一个丰富的煤田。他们说：“我们是毛泽东时代的地质工作者，为了世界人民的利益不畏任何艰险。”
    坦桑尼亚人民感动地向中国朋友说：“从你们身上我们看到了中国人民高贵的品质”。他们高呼：“中国—坦桑尼亚友谊万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”一位即将离开工地的坦桑尼亚工人依依不舍地握着中国工程技术人员的手说：“同你们相处的日子里，我看到了毛主席教导的中国工程技术人员是多么好。请你们回国后代我向毛主席问好，坦桑尼亚人民感谢他老人家。”
