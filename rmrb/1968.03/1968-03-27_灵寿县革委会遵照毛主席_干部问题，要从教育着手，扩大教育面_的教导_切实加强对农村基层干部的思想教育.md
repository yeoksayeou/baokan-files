The Lingxu County Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great instruction that "cadre issues should be addressed through education, expanding the scope of education," has earnestly strengthened the ideological education of rural grassroots cadres. This has led to significant changes in the spiritual outlook of these cadres.

The first sign of this change is that rural grassroots cadres have developed a deeper love for Chairman Mao and have become more diligent in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. When they encounter problems, they first seek guidance from Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions, rather than relying on old experiences.

Another sign of this change is the correct handling of the relationship between the individual and the masses. When the masses express their opinions or suggestions about their plans and work, they conduct investigations and research according to Chairman Mao's instructions. If there are mistakes, they correct them; if they are right, they persuade the masses, rather than forcing the masses to execute their plans. When facing criticism from the masses, they humbly examine their own shortcomings and errors, finding the root cause in their work style, rather than resisting criticism or emphasizing objective factors.

A third sign of this change is the correct handling of their own attitudes. They follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, treating themselves both as a force for revolution and as an object of revolution. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they engage in self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism, setting an example and leading the masses.

A fourth sign of this change is the correct handling of the relationship between politics and business. After the higher authorities assign various tasks, they organize special Mao Zedong Thought study classes or hold meetings, studying Chairman Mao's works with the masses and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide all business work. After the autumn harvest last year, the county's rural grassroots cadres, following Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. They led the masses to actively deliver grain to the state, resulting in Lingxu County being the first in Hebei Province to complete the annual grain delivery task.

A fifth sign of this change is a significant transformation in their leadership style. They follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "be both an official and a common person," actively participating in collective production labor. Many tasks are completed by squeezing in time. The masses are very satisfied with this, saying, "This is truly a good cadre as taught by Chairman Mao."

The Lingxu County Revolutionary Committee persists in using Mao Zedong Thought to strengthen the ideological education of rural grassroots cadres. The measures they have taken are as follows:

First, they organize large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, mobilizing cadres and the masses to engage in self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism. In these classes, they first focus on class education, arousing the grassroots cadres' boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, they engage in self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism, transforming their worldview.

Second, they convene cadre meetings to help them correctly handle their relationship with the masses. Some cadres do not understand the mass movement and cannot correctly handle their relationship with the masses. The county revolutionary committee has convened two large-scale cadre meetings, inviting the main leaders of production brigades and teams to participate. They help them understand the great significance and tremendous victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, recognize the mainstream of the mass movement, and educate them to establish the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, actively engaging in the revolution.

Third, they promote heart-to-heart talks. In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the influence of the capitalist reactionary line, many grassroots cadres were affected, and there were some estrangements between county, commune, and brigade cadres. County and commune leaders took advantage of study classes, cadre meetings, and fieldwork opportunities to talk with grassroots cadres, exchange views, and eliminate estrangements. Grassroots cadres expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end.

Fourth, they promote exemplary models and learn from advanced examples. They identify cadres who have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and adhered to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, help them summarize their experiences, and promote them in large meetings, over the radio, or in on-site conferences.

Chairman Mao has taught us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. This issue must be resolved." In the face of the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Lingxu County Revolutionary Committee has focused on the ideological education of grassroots cadres, driving the revolution and production forward. The broad masses of rural grassroots cadres take the lead in rallying their spirits, striving for progress, promoting the revolution, and boosting production. The masses have shown greater revolutionary enthusiasm than in previous years, actively engaging in water conservancy projects, repairing irrigation equipment, preparing seeds, fertilizing, rolling fields, and carrying out spring plowing. They are determined to achieve double victories in the revolution and agricultural production.

### 灵寿县革委会遵照毛主席“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”的教导  切实加强对农村基层干部的思想教育

    灵寿县革委会遵照毛主席“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”的教导
    切实加强对农村基层干部的思想教育
    据新华社石家庄二十四日电　河北省灵寿县革命委员会遵照毛主席“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”的伟大教导，切实加强对农村基层干部的思想教育，使农村基层干部的精神面貌发生了显著的变化。
    农村基层干部精神面貌发生显著变化的第一个标志是，他们更加热爱毛主席，更加认真地活学活用毛泽东思想，他们遇到问题，首先向毛主席请教，从毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示中找答案，而不是按老经验办事。
    显著变化的另一个标志是，正确处理个人和群众的关系。群众对他们的想法和工作计划提出意见时，他们就按照毛主席的指示进行调查研究，有了错误就改，对的就说服群众，而不是强迫群众去执行。在听到群众的批评时，他们虚心地检查自己的缺点和错误，从思想作风上找根源，而不是抵制批评或者强调客观因素。
    显著变化的第三个标志是，能够正确地对待自己。他们按照林彪副主席的指示，既把自己当作革命的一份力量，又不断地把自己当作革命的对象，以毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修，以身作则，带动群众。
    显著变化的第四个标志是，正确处理政治和业务的关系。上级把各项业务工作布置下来以后，他们就举办专题毛泽东思想学习班，或者召开座谈会，和群众一起学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切业务工作。去年秋收后，全县农村基层干部按照毛主席的教导，正确处理国家、集体和社员三者之间的关系，带动广大社员积极向国家交售粮食，结果，在河北省第一个超额完成了全年粮食交售任务。
    显著变化的第五个标志是，领导作风有很大转变。他们按照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，积极参加集体生产劳动，许多工作尽量挤时间办。社员群众对这一点非常满意，说“这才真正是毛主席教导的好干部。”
    河北省灵寿县革命委员会坚持用毛泽东思想加强对农村基层干部进行思想教育。他们采取的措施是：
    第一，大办毛泽东思想学习班，组织干部和群众一起斗私批修。在学习班里，首先大抓阶级教育，激发基层干部对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情。以毛主席的最新指示为武器，进行斗私批修，改造世界观。
    第二，召开干部会议，帮助他们正确对待群众。有一些干部对群众运动不理解，不能正确地对待群众。县革委会就连续召开两次大型的干部会，吸收生产大队和生产队主要领导干部参加，帮助他们认识无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和所取得的巨大胜利，认清群众运动的主流，教育他们树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神，积极起来干革命。
    第三，开展谈心活动。无产阶级文化大革命初期，由于资产阶级反动路线的影响，许多基层干部受到冲击，县、公社和生产大队干部之间，形成了一些隔阂，干部互相有意见，不接近。县、社领导干部就利用学习班、干部会和下乡工作的机会，找基层干部谈心，交换意见，消除了隔阂。基层干部表示，决心跟着毛主席革命到底。
    第四，抓典型树样板，学先进赶先进。发现在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的好干部，就帮助他们总结经验，在大会上、有线广播中或召开现场会推广。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”灵寿县革命委员会在取得无产阶级文化大革命决定性胜利的大好形势下，狠抓基层干部的思想教育，推动着革命和生产胜利向前发展。广大农村基层干部带头鼓足干劲，力争上游，抓革命、促生产，社员们发挥比往年更大的革命干劲，积极兴修水利工程，检修排灌机具，准备种子，积极送粪，耙压麦田，开展备耕工作，决心夺取革命和农业生产双胜利。
