In the midst of the triumphant drums of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary committee of Guangdong Province, located by the South China Sea, has just been established. From the northeastern part of the country, under the Changbai Mountains, comes another piece of heartening news: the revolutionary committees of Jilin Province and Changchun City have been simultaneously and triumphantly born. The nation's hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel are celebrating this joyously. People are raising their arms and shouting a thousand and ten thousand times: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The birth of the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee once again powerfully proves the great leader Chairman Mao's wise judgment: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than at any time in the past. In a few more months, the situation will be even better." Revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people from all places have been greatly inspired by this. They have expressed their determination to learn from the proletarian revolutionaries of Jilin Province, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to be infinitely loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They will further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary committees from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Qinghai, Gansu, and other places have sent congratulatory telegrams and letters to the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Many places have held celebrations or discussion meetings to celebrate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought's another great victory. Revolutionary masses from various places have pointed out that the birth of the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee once again vividly shows that following the great commander Chairman Mao is victory. Comrade Cai Yongxiang, a communist warrior, from Lakebin People's Commune in Feidong County, Anhui Province, said excitedly, "We must be like Comrade Cai Yongxiang, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life and die for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." The revolutionary masses of Qinghutang Street in Changsha City, Hunan Province, have expressed their determination to take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating self" as the key link, to run the Mao Zedong Thought study classes better and better, and to firmly establish the "loyalty" to Chairman Mao in their hearts, letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly over all positions.

The revolutionary workers of Shanxi Hongwei Textile Factory pointed out when celebrating the birth of the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee that the great victory achieved by the Jilin proletarian revolutionaries is the fruitful result of their earnest implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. Where Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented, there the revolution achieves victory. We must be like the Jilin proletarian revolutionaries, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and promote the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao himself. We must truly learn Chairman Mao's latest instructions and use them, learn a bit and use a bit, speak and act consistently, and see immediate results. The revolutionary masses of Yinchuan City said excitedly, "The red sun shines over Changbai Mountain, and the red flag rolls over Liupanshan Mountain. We must humbly learn from the comrades in Jilin Province, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and strive harder for the early birth of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee." The responsible person of the Red Guards Congress of middle schools in Lanzhou Region said, "The establishment of the Jilin Revolutionary Committee is a powerful promotion for us to further implement Chairman Mao's 'March 7' instructions and a series of latest instructions. The middle schools in Lanzhou Region have already fully resumed classes. We are determined to ignite the flames of educational revolution under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and turn the middle schools in Lanzhou Region into red Mao Zedong Thought universities."

Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses from Shandong, Liaoning, Zhejiang, Guangxi, and other places pointed out that solving the cadre issue according to Mao Zedong Thought, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue, consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, are important guarantees for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They expressed their determination to learn from the experience and example of the broad revolutionary masses in Jilin Province in correctly implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy, continuing to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, enhancing proletarian party spirit, and unconditionally implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue, realizing, consolidating, and developing the three-in-one combination.

Revolutionary masses from many places and units that have already established revolutionary committees, when celebrating the establishment of the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee, have seriously studied and understood Chairman Mao's teachings on establishing revolutionary committees. They have expressed their determination to further establish the proletarian authority of the revolutionary committees. Many members of the revolutionary committees of 24 full-time higher education institutions in Shanghai have expressed that the revolutionary committee is not a liaison station for various factions but a temporary power organ of the proletarian dictatorship of the three-in-one combination. We must be representatives of the proletarian revolutionaries and servants of the broad revolutionary people, and we must not be representatives of small groups and factions. We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, exercise and use power according to the principles of proletarian party spirit, and resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." When celebrating the birth of the Jilin Province and Changchun City Revolutionary Committees, the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army have reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings. They have expressed that we, the children of the people, warmly support, firmly support, bravely defend, and respect and maintain the revolutionary authority of the newly born proletarian revolutionary power. We must heighten our vigilance, strengthen our preparedness, and be ready at any time to smash all sabotage plots of the domestic and foreign class enemies, defend socialist motherland, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" have expressed their determination to be like all the cadres and fighters of the troops stationed in Jilin, to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and to achieve new victories in the struggle for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
