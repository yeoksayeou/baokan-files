Title: Mobilize to Attack Anarchism

Our factory has achieved great victories in the struggle against anarchism. However, in this struggle, a few people have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, saying: "Why rush? Once everyone else has overcome anarchism, our place will be fine too." Some people also say: "Our unit's leadership hasn't moved yet, so why should we rush?" Therefore, in these units, anarchist tendencies still run rampant!

We can't keep waiting like this! Have these comrades thought about the fact that while they are waiting, the class enemies are never resting. Anarchism, in collusion with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, is constantly corrupting the souls of revolutionary comrades and obstructing the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Faced with such a situation, shouldn't we urgently mobilize and quickly defeat and expose anarchism? What are we waiting for?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary forces, if you don't beat them, they won't fall." Similarly, we need to launch a "people's war" against anarchism and eliminate its poison. The idea that anarchism will suddenly disappear on its own without a struggle is an unrealistic fantasy.

We hope that in places where anarchism still exists, whether it is among leading comrades or ordinary masses, everyone should replace the word "wait" with "fight." Everyone should take action and shout to attack, making anarchism a rat crossing the street—wherever it appears, it should be eliminated there.

　　动员起来，向无政府主义开火
    我们工厂围剿无政府主义已经取得了很大胜利。但是，在这场斗争中，也有少数人采取了等待的态度，说：忙什么！等人家都克服了无政府主义，我们这里也就好了。也有人说：我们单位领导上还没有动，我们急什么！因此，在这些单位，无政府主义倾向仍然畅通无阻！
    不能再这样等下去了！这些同志可曾想到，在你等的时候，阶级敌人一时一刻也没有睡觉。无政府主义配合着资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，时时刻刻都在腐蚀着革命同志的灵魂，阻碍着毛主席最新指示的落实。面对着这样的情况，难道还不应该紧急动员起来，迅速把无政府主义打倒搞臭，更待何时！？
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”对待无政府主义同样需要发动一场“人民战争”，并肃清它的流毒。那种企图不经过斗争，无政府主义会在一天早晨突然自行消灭的想法，是不切实际的幻想。
    我们希望，目前还有无政府主义的地方，无论是领导同志，还是普通群众，都应当把“等”字换成“斗”字，人人动手，个个喊打，使无政府主义成为过街老鼠，它在哪里出现，就把它消灭在哪里。
