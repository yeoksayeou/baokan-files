In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of women have participated in the movement with unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm, becoming an important component of the vast army of the cultural revolution.

The development of the Chinese revolution is also the process of the liberation of the broad masses of working women. Our great leader Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to the participation of the broad masses of working women in the revolutionary struggle and regards the cause of the liberation of working women as an important part of the entire cause of the proletarian revolution. As early as the initial period of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Women make up half of the population. The economic status of working women and their particularly oppressed situation not only prove the urgent need for women in the revolution but also are a decisive force in the victory or defeat of the revolution. In the future, we must have concrete slogans and carry out extensive propaganda for women." In 1939, Chairman Mao again pointed out: "When women across the country rise up, it will be the time of victory for the Chinese revolution." This shows that in the entire revolutionary movement, the masses of women are a great force. The broad masses of oppressed women can only change their own status by following the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao and through socialist transformation.

However, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, have formulated and implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the women's movement. China's Khrushchev has never regarded the broad masses of women as a revolutionary force. He opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, peddles the bourgeois "view on women" and "welfare view," and emphasizes the so-called special interests of women, opposing women's revolution, and striving to make the broad masses of women detach themselves from the current political struggle, from the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. He attempts to use the women's work front as a base for his activities to restore capitalism, turning women's organizations into a tool to promote revisionism. China's Khrushchev is the sworn enemy of revolutionary women across the country.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the women's movement

A ship needs a helmsman, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work and is also the guiding ideology of the women's movement. We working women, who suffered the deepest oppression in the old society, particularly understand that to make a revolution, the most important thing is to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

China's Khrushchev is an old counter-revolutionary who is extremely afraid of women mastering Mao Zedong Thought and goes to great lengths to oppose women studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In July 1958, at a meeting with street cadres and residents in Tianjin, he said: "I wonder if we should propose two slogans: one is to participate in production, and the other is to participate in study... What to study? One is technology, and the other is culture." He never mentioned studying Chairman Mao's works and opposed the broad masses of women arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought.

In 1960, Vice Chairman Lin Biao issued the great call to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought." The All-China Women's Federation, under the demand of the broad revolutionary women, proposed to print and distribute Chairman Mao's quotations on the women's movement. However, China's Khrushchev did not allow it. He even issued a black directive: "Use fewer authorities and conduct more free discussions and debates among comrades." This is how he arrogantly attacked Chairman Mao, attempting to lower Chairman Mao's exalted prestige in the hearts of revolutionary women across the country.

In 1964, a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works swept through cities and countryside across the country, and a large number of active learners emerged, with working women making up a significant proportion. At this time, the All-China Women's Federation, in response to the demands of the grassroots, proposed that the first condition for evaluating excellent women's congresses was "studying Chairman Mao's works well." However, China's Khrushchev's accomplice, Lu Dingyi, spouted reactionary fallacies, saying that "studying the Selected Works of Mao Zedong cannot be forced" and "do not use studying Chairman Mao's works as an evaluation condition." Thus, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the All-China Women's Federation, according to this black "instruction," removed this condition. In 1965, the All-China Women's Federation held a conference of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region women's federation chairpersons in Beidaihe. Another major capitalist-roader within the Party, through his lackeys planted in the women's federation, maliciously slandered studying Chairman Mao's works as "exorbitant taxes" and absurdly claimed that women have "low culture, heavy housework, and many children" and cannot study Chairman Mao's works. This was extremely arrogant!

Chairman Mao's books are the treasure books of the revolutionary people of the world and are also the treasure books for working women to fight for liberation. Widely spreading and fully implementing Chairman Mao's instructions is the complete victory of the revolution. We must learn, execute, propagate, and defend Chairman Mao's instructions from generation to generation. The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party opposes us studying Chairman Mao's works and attempts to make women detach themselves from Mao Zedong Thought to engage in "free discussions and debates." Isn't this allowing bourgeois reactionary thoughts to spread freely and opening the door wide for the restoration of capitalism?

Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "We must, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, instill Mao Zedong Thought into the workers and peasants, change the spiritual outlook of the laboring people, and turn spiritual strength into tremendous material force." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary masses studied Chairman Mao's works extensively, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes spread from society to the family. Mao Zedong Thought achieved unprecedented popularity. The broad masses of working women, after studying Chairman Mao's works, achieved unprecedented political and ideological awakening, ensuring that the women's movement developed healthily along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

The fundamental issue of proletarian dictatorship is the fundamental issue of the women's movement

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." Before liberation, Chinese women were subjected to the control of four powers: political power, clan power, divine power, and husband power. "The landlord political power is the backbone of all powers. Once the landlord political power is overthrown, clan power, divine power, and husband power will all be shaken." Chairman Mao's teachings clearly tell us: the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power, and the fundamental issue of the women's movement is also the issue of power. Only by overthrowing the power of the exploiting classes and establishing proletarian dictatorship can there be everything for the laboring people, and everything for working women.

During the period of the national democratic revolution, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people used revolutionary war to oppose the armed domestic and foreign class enemies. The fundamental task of the women's movement during this period was to mobilize and organize the masses of women to actively participate in and support the revolutionary war, to defeat Japanese imperialism, overthrow the reactionary Kuomintang government, and establish proletarian dictatorship, contributing their strength.

However, China's Khrushchev went against the grain. He denied that the fundamental issue of the women's movement was the issue of power and, with ulterior motives, regarded solving women's special problems as the fundamental policy and fundamental task of the women's movement. At the critical moments of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, in his "instructions" on women's work, he did not mention a word about mobilizing women to participate in the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation but instead talked extensively about developing production, planning life, and getting rich. He said: "The policy for women's work in the base areas is 'construction.' 'The central task of women's work is also production. If production is not good, food will not be good.'" China's Khrushchev, to prevent women from participating in the revolutionary struggle, deliberately distorted the revolutionary nature of women's organizations. He absurdly said that "women's (organizations) are also economic organizations, not political organizations." He criticized the use of organizations like the "Women's Anti-Imperialist Association" to mobilize women, absurdly claiming that this was a "leftist" approach and "not a demand of the masses." He advocated that women work hard to produce, achieve abundant clothing and food, saying, "We propose abundant clothing and food, which means abundant clothing and food for the family."

In 1943, Chairman Mao called on the people in the base areas to "work hard and achieve abundant clothing and food" to support the frontline battles and ensure people's lives. At that time, the Anti-Japanese base areas were facing the mad attacks of the enemy on one side and the economic blockade of the Kuomintang reactionaries on the other, causing great difficulties for both the frontline battles and the rear life. In the decisions on women's work made by the Party Central Committee in 1943 and 1948, it was also advocated that women actively produce, and it was pointed out: "This is equally a glorious task as sending men to the frontline." However, China's Khrushchev distorted Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's correct calls into only pursuing "abundant clothing and food for the family." This was a blatant opposition to women participating in the revolutionary struggle, attempting to make the women's movement deviate from the track of the national democratic revolution, making the masses of women only care about their own family's sustenance, not the revolutionary interests, and walk the capitalist road of getting rich.

China's Khrushchev is a "parliamentary fanatic." On one hand, he opposed women participating in the revolution and seeking liberation through revolutionary struggle, and on the other hand, he advocated bourgeois feminism, attempting to solve the so-called women's issues through parliamentary struggle. In 1943, he absurdly said to the comrades of the Central Women's Commission: "Now women do not need democracy but need women leaders." In his view, the liberation of working women does not need to seize power and implement proletarian dictatorship but only needs a few women to become "ministers," "leaders," and "councilors" to implement the so-called women's "participation in politics."

This is a major exposure of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary conspiracy. Without armed struggle, would imperialism automatically withdraw from China, and would the Kuomintang reactionaries hand over power? Without proletarian dictatorship, could the Chinese people and Chinese women be liberated? China's Khrushchev's mad opposition to women participating in the revolutionary struggle and advocacy of bourgeois feminism were precisely attempts to sabotage the proletarian women's movement.

In the early days of liberation, the country was carrying out the magnificent movements of land reform, eliminating bandits and tyrants, and supporting Korea against America, which were major struggles related to consolidating our newly born proletarian state power. Facing this situation, China's Khrushchev, when receiving the representatives of the First National Women's Congress, said: "The first task of the Women's Federation's work, whether it is the five-year plan or the ten-year plan, the Women's Federation should call on women to engage in the nursery industry and child welfare industry." China's Khrushchev did not mention a word about mobilizing women to participate in real political struggles but instead talked extensively about solving women's special problems, emphasizing that this was the "first task," placing it above the central task of the Party and the people across the country.

China's Khrushchev's one-sided emphasis on women's special problems ultimately boils down to emphasizing the differences between men and women, erasing class antagonisms, and thus opposing women's revolution. Women, like men, belong to various classes and are fundamentally not a classless entity.

Marxist-Leninists have always acknowledged the existence of special problems for working women and are concerned about women's special problems. In 1934, Chairman Mao called on us to "care about the people's lives," which included caring about solving women's special problems. After liberation, the Party established many welfare institutions for women and children, enabling more working women to participate in class struggle and production struggle. However, the solution to women's special problems must serve the interests of the proletarian revolutionary struggle. If we detach ourselves from the proletarian struggle to seize and consolidate power, exaggerate the special nature of women's issues, and purely pursue women's so-called welfare, we will divert the political direction of the women's movement and lead the broad masses of women down the capitalist road. China's Khrushchev's evil conspiracy must be thoroughly exposed!

The socialist road is the road to women's liberation

The issue of women arose with the emergence of private ownership. Only by eliminating private ownership can the laboring people and working women achieve complete liberation. Lenin once taught us many times: "Wherever capitalism still exists, where land private ownership and factory private ownership are still preserved, where capitalist power is still preserved, men are always privileged there." "Because of private ownership... women are in a position of double oppression."

The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the transition of the Chinese revolution from the stage of the new democratic revolution to the stage of the socialist revolution. Is China to take the socialist road or the capitalist road? This is the focal point of the struggle between two classes and two lines. At the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao emphasized: "After the victory of the Chinese revolution across the country and the solution of the land problem, China still has two basic contradictions. The first is domestic, that is, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao wrote for the magazine "New China Women": "Unite and participate in production and political activities, and improve women's economic and political status." Therefore, the masses of women must actively participate in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, eliminate the system of exploitation, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, resolutely take the socialist road, and seek liberation in this struggle.

In 1955, under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce reached a climax. To successfully complete the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, we must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class." However, China's Khrushchev sang a different tune, absurdly saying that "the working class may not be reliable at certain times." On one hand, he slandered the working class, and on the other hand, he whitewashed the bourgeoisie and extolled the wives of capitalists, doing everything possible to seek political status for the bourgeoisie. He absurdly said: "Among the bourgeoisie, among the wives of the bourgeoisie, among the children of the bourgeoisie, there is a group of activists who support communism and propagate communism. These activists are very valuable." He even absurdly said: "The words of a capitalist's wife at night can be more powerful than two vice-premiers. We should see her role in this way." Because China's Khrushchev proposed and promoted the line of class capitulation, the leadership of some grassroots women's congresses in large cities was usurped by the wives of capitalists. Some wives of capitalists set up nurseries and even stole the title of "active builder of socialism." China's Khrushchev praised the capitalists and their wives to the skies because they were the social foundation for his restoration of capitalism.

In the agricultural cooperativization movement, Chairman Mao gave many wise instructions on the women's movement. He said: "To mobilize all female labor power to participate in the labor front on the principle of equal pay for equal work, this requirement should be realized in the shortest possible time." He also said: "True equality between men and women can only be achieved in the process of the socialist transformation of the whole society." Chairman Mao's instructions greatly encouraged the broad masses of working women, and their enthusiasm for participating in collective production reached an unprecedented height.

In December 1956, the All-China Women's Federation held a conference on rural women's work. China's Khrushchev, through his lackeys, issued a black directive for this conference. They opposed Chairman Mao's programmatic document "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" and, from the perspective of women's work, strongly opposed the agricultural cooperativization movement and dismantled the socialist collective economy in agriculture. They absurdly said: "Women should not participate too much in field production, should not compete with male labor for work, and housework also has social value." They also opposed the regulation in the "National Program for Agricultural Development" that women's productive labor time should not be less than 80 to 180 days, shouting, "This is not a law, and seven years later, it won't be a crime if it can't be done." The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the All-China Women's Federation closely followed, using the pretext of caring about women's household burdens and farmers' family lives to call on women to engage in family sideline businesses and advocate the development of private economy. Their purpose was to oppose rural working women taking the socialist road, making our countryside retain and develop individual economy, and prepare conditions for the restoration of capitalism.

In 1957, the class struggle at home and abroad was extremely sharp, and the rightist elements launched a fierce attack on the Party. Under Chairman Mao's personal leadership, the entire Party and the people across the country fought back against the rightist elements and achieved a great victory.

Just in September of that year, the Third National Women's Congress, manipulated by China's Khrushchev, was held. This congress did not mention studying Chairman Mao's works, mentioned the struggle against the rightists and the struggle between the two lines in the countryside very little, but according to China's Khrushchev's "instructions," put forward "frugal nation-building and frugal family management" as the "fundamental policy for the women's movement in our country in the future." Another major capitalist-roader within the Party also "instructed" that "the work of the Women's Federation should never forget the word 'home' at any time." This was the essence of their "two frugals" policy. It is necessary to grasp "frugal family management" as a specific task. We should always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and think about the fact that our country is a large socialist country and a poor country with a backward economy. We should strive hard and execute the principle of frugality in everything. However, we must oppose individualism that disregards national and collective interests and oppose the "frugal enrichment" of small producers. They waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, saying that they wanted to "build the nation frugally" on the surface but emphasizing "frugal family management" one-sidedly, actually wanting women to detach themselves from the three great revolutionary movements, only care about the living arrangements of small families, care about private plots and family sideline businesses, and walk the capitalist road of "getting rich." The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the All-China Women's Federation understood this well and made a big deal out of "frugal family management." The magazine "Chinese Women" even held a special discussion on "frugal family management." They tried to attract the attention of the masses of women to family life, making the broad masses of women calculate every penny for their own private interests, undermining the revolutionary will of the masses of women, making women's work revolve around the bourgeois "self," and heading towards the dead end of capitalism.

In 1958, under the inspiration of the Party's general line for building socialism, the people across the country raised the three red banners high, launching a high tide of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the country presented a prosperous scene. The broad masses of working women broke through the heavy shackles set by the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, full of spirit and fighting spirit, and joined the ranks of the Great Leap Forward. In 1961, when our country was facing temporary difficulties, another major capitalist-roader within the Party, at the conference of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region women's federation chairpersons, still stubbornly attracted the attention of the masses of women to family life, further emphasizing their "two frugals policy, unchanged for ten years." Under the influence of this erroneous ideology, in some places, the evil winds of "men in collective, women free," "men do agriculture, women do sideline businesses," and "eating depends on the collective, spending depends on oneself" prevailed for a time. At the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle," making the broad masses of working women see more clearly and more brightly, resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's great call, and firmly taking the socialist road.

In the women's movement, for a long time, there has been a sharp struggle between two lines. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line guides us to participate in the revolutionary struggle, establish and consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and take the socialist road. We must have a heart for the motherland and an eye for the world. We not only need to carry out the revolution in our own country but also actively support the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat in all countries around the world to seek liberation. At present, we resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism" and criticize and repudiate China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the women's movement and his bourgeois "view on women" and "welfare view." The more China's Khrushchev does not allow women to make a revolution, the more we must resolutely take the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao. We must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, quickly and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever fly high on the women's work front!

　　劳动妇女坚决走毛主席指引的革命道路
　　——彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义妇女运动路线
　　全国妇联无产阶级革命派
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大妇女群众以空前的革命热情投入运动，成为浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军中的重要组成力量。
    中国革命的发展过程，也就是广大劳动妇女逐步获得解放的过程。我们伟大领袖毛主席从来就十分重视广大劳动妇女参加革命斗争，并把劳动妇女的解放事业看作是无产阶级整个革命事业的一个重要组成部分。早在第二次国内革命战争初期，毛主席就指出：“妇女占人口的半数，劳动妇女在经济上的地位和她们特别受压迫的状况，不但证明妇女对革命的迫切需要，而且是决定革命胜败的一个力量，以后对妇女要有切实的口号，做普遍的宣传。”一九三九年毛主席又指出：“全国妇女起来之日，就是中国革命胜利之时。”这说明在整个革命运动中，妇女群众是一个伟大的力量。广大被压迫妇女只有走毛主席指引的革命道路，通过社会主义改造，才能改变她们自己的地位。
    但是，以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内一小撮走资派，却在妇女运动中制定和推行了一条反革命修正主义路线。中国赫鲁晓夫从来不把广大妇女群众看作是一支革命力量。他对抗毛主席的革命路线，大肆贩卖资产阶级的“妇女观点”和“福利观点”，片面强调所谓妇女的特殊利益，反对妇女革命，极力使广大妇女离开当前的政治斗争，离开无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。他妄图把妇女工作阵地作为他复辟资本主义的一个活动基地，使妇女组织变成推行修正主义的一个工具。中国赫鲁晓夫是全国革命妇女的不共戴天的仇敌。
　　毛泽东思想是妇女运动的指导思想
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指导方针，也是妇女运动的指导思想。我们劳动妇女在旧社会受压迫最深，尤其深刻地体会到要闹革命，最重要的就是要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是一个老反革命，非常害怕妇女掌握毛泽东思想，千方百计地反对妇女活学活用毛主席著作。一九五八年七月，他在天津街道干部和居民座谈会上说：“我想是不是提两个口号：一是参加生产，一是参加学习……学什么呢？一个是技术，一个是文化。”他就是不谈学习毛主席著作，反对广大妇女用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。
    一九六○年。林彪副主席发出了“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的伟大号召。全国妇联在广大革命妇女的要求下，提出要印发毛主席关于妇女运动的语录，而中国赫鲁晓夫却不准印发。他竟下了这么一个黑批示：“少用一些权威，多在同志中进行自由的讨论和辩论”。他就是这样狂妄地攻击毛主席，妄图贬低毛主席在全国革命妇女心目中的崇高威望。
    一九六四年，全国城乡都已掀起学习毛主席著作的群众运动高潮，学习毛主席著作的积极分子大量涌现，其中劳动妇女占很大的比例。这时，全国妇联适应基层的要求，提出评比五好妇代会的条件第一条是“学习毛主席著作好”。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫的死党陆定一却大发反动谬论，说什么“学毛选不能强迫”，“不要把学习毛主席著作作为评比条件”。于是，全国妇联党内一小撮走资派按照这个黑“指示”，把这一条砍掉了。一九六五年，全国妇联在北戴河召开省、市、自治区妇联主任会议。党内另一个最大的走资派，又通过他安插在妇联的爪牙，在会上大肆诬蔑学习毛主席著作是“苛捐杂税”，并胡说妇女“文化低、家务重、孩子多，不能学习毛主席著作”。真是猖狂已极！
    毛主席的书是全世界革命人民的宝书，也是劳动妇女争取解放的宝书。广泛传播、全面落实毛主席的指示，就是革命的全面胜利。我们就是要世世代代永远学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的指示。党内最大的一小撮走资派反对我们学习毛主席著作，妄想让妇女离开毛泽东思想去进行什么“自由的讨论和辩论”，这不就是让资产阶级反动思想自由泛滥，给资本主义复辟大开方便之门吗？
    林彪副主席说：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命群众大学毛主席著作，毛泽东思想学习班从社会发展到家庭。毛泽东思想得到了空前的大普及。广大劳动妇女学了毛主席著作，政治思想觉悟得到了空前提高，使妇女运动沿着毛主席指引的方向健康发展，有了最根本的保证。
　　无产阶级专政问题是妇女运动的根本问题
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”中国妇女在解放前受着政权、族权、神权、夫权四种权力的支配，而“地主政权，是一切权力的基干。地主政权既被打翻，族权、神权、夫权便一概跟着动摇起来。”毛主席的教导，清楚地告诉我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题，妇女运动的根本问题也是政权问题。只有推翻剥削阶级的政权，建立无产阶级专政，才有劳动人民的一切，才有劳动妇女的一切。
    在民族民主革命时期，中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，用革命战争来反对武装的国内外的阶级敌人。这个时期妇女运动的根本任务，就是动员和组织妇女群众积极参加和支援革命战争，为打败日本帝国主义，推翻国民党反动政权，建立无产阶级专政而贡献自己的力量。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却反其道而行之。他否认妇女运动的根本问题是政权问题，别有用心地把解决妇女的特殊问题作为妇女运动的根本方针和根本任务。在抗日战争和解放战争的重要时刻，他对妇女工作所作的“指示”中，只字不提发动妇女参加抗日战争和解放战争，而是大谈特谈发展生产，计划生活，发家致富。他说：根据地妇女工作的方针是“建设”。“妇女工作的中心任务也是搞生产。生产不好，饭就吃不好。”中国赫鲁晓夫为了不让妇女参加革命斗争，极力篡改妇女团体的革命性质。他胡说什么“妇女（团体）也是经济团体，不是政治组织”。他指责用“妇女救国会”这样的团体去发动妇女，胡说这是“左”的做法，“不是群众切身要求”。他号召妇女努力生产，达到丰衣足食，说“我们提出丰衣足食，就是家庭的丰衣足食”。
    一九四三年，毛主席号召根据地人民“自己动手，丰衣足食”，以支援前方作战，保证人民生活。当时的抗日根据地，一方面是日寇的疯狂进攻，一方面是国民党反动派的经济封锁，使前方作战、后方生活都发生很大的困难。一九四三年和一九四八年党中央所作的妇女工作决定中，也号召妇女积极生产，并且指出：这“与壮丁上前线同样是战斗的光荣任务”。而中国赫鲁晓夫却把毛主席和党中央的正确号召，篡改为只搞“家庭的丰衣足食”。这是明目张胆地反对妇女参加革命斗争，妄想使妇女运动脱离民族民主革命的轨道，使妇女群众只顾一家温饱，不顾革命利益，走上发家致富的资本主义道路。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是个“议会迷”。他一方面反对妇女参加革命，通过革命斗争求得解放，一方面鼓吹资产阶级的女权主义，妄图通过议会斗争来解决所谓妇女问题。一九四三年，他对中央妇委的同志胡说什么：“现在妇女不需要民主，倒是需要妇女领袖。”在他看来，劳动妇女的解放，不需要夺取政权，实行无产阶级专政，只要有几个妇女当上“部长”、“领袖”、“参议员”，实行所谓妇女“参政”就行了。
    这是中国赫鲁晓夫反革命阴谋的一个大暴露。难道不通过武装斗争，帝国主义就会自动退出中国，国民党反动派就会拱手让权吗？难道没有无产阶级专政，中国人民和中国妇女能够得到解放吗？中国赫鲁晓夫这样疯狂地反对妇女参加革命斗争，宣扬资产阶级的女权主义，正是妄想破坏无产阶级的妇女运动。
    解放初期，全国正在开展轰轰烈烈的土地改革、清匪反霸、抗美援朝等伟大运动，这是关系到巩固我们新生的无产阶级政权的重大斗争。面对这种形势，中国赫鲁晓夫在接见全国第一次妇女代表大会代表时却说：“妇联工作的头一个任务，无论五年计划也好，十年计划也好，妇联应该号召妇女从事托儿所事业和儿童福利事业。”中国赫鲁晓夫只字不提发动妇女参加现实的政治斗争，却大谈解决什么妇女特殊问题，强调这是“头一个任务”，把它凌驾于党和全国人民的中心任务之上。
    中国赫鲁晓夫片面强调妇女的特殊问题，归根到底是片面强调男女的差别，抹煞阶级的对立，从而反对妇女革命。妇女和男子一样，是分属于各个阶级的，根本就没有超阶级的妇女。
    马克思列宁主义者从来承认劳动妇女存在特殊问题，而且关心妇女的特殊问题。一九三四年，毛主席号召我们“关心群众生活”，其中就包括了关心解决妇女的特殊问题。解放后，党为妇女儿童设立了不少福利机构，使更多的劳动妇女能参加阶级斗争、生产斗争。但是，妇女特殊问题的解决，必须服从无产阶级革命斗争的利益。如果离开无产阶级夺取政权、巩固政权的革命斗争，夸大妇女问题的特殊性，单纯地去搞妇女的所谓福利，那就转移了妇女运动的政治方向，把广大妇女群众引向资本主义道路。中国赫鲁晓夫这一罪恶阴谋必须彻底戳穿！
　　社会主义道路是妇女解放的道路
    妇女问题是随着私有制的产生而产生的，只有消灭私有制，劳动人民和劳动妇女才能得到彻底解放。列宁曾经多次教导我们：“哪里还存在着资本主义，还保留着土地私有制和工厂私有制，还保留着资本政权，那里的男子总是有特权的。”“因为私有制……使妇女处于受双重奴役的地位。”
    中华人民共和国的成立，标志着中国革命由新民主主义革命阶段推进到社会主义革命阶段。中国走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路？这是两个阶级、两条路线斗争的焦点。毛主席在党的七届二中全会上着重指出：“中国革命在全国胜利，并且解决了土地问题以后，中国还存在着两种基本的矛盾。第一种是国内的，即工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾。”毛主席为《新中国妇女》杂志题词说：“团结起来，参加生产和政治活动，改善妇女的经济地位和政治地位”。因此，妇女群众必须积极参加阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，消灭剥削制度，巩固无产阶级专政，坚决走社会主义道路，并在这个斗争中求得解放。
    一九五五年，在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的过渡时期总路线光辉照耀下，我国农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造达到高潮。要能胜利地完成资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，只有坚决地按照毛主席的教导：“我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫大唱反调，胡说什么“工人阶级在一定的时候也可能是不能依靠的”。他一面诬蔑工人阶级，一面又为资产阶级涂脂抹粉，并极力美化资本家老婆，千方百计地为资产阶级谋取政治地位。他胡说什么：“在资产阶级中间，在资产阶级的老婆中间，在资产阶级的子女中间，有一批积极分子，赞成共产，宣传共产，这种积极分子是很可宝贵的。”他甚至胡说什么：“资本家的老婆晚上回去一席话就比两个副总理还厉害，要这样看他的作用。”由于中国赫鲁晓夫提出和推行阶级投降路线，一些大城市的基层妇代会被资本家老婆篡夺了领导权。有的资本家老婆办了托儿所，居然窃取了“社会主义建设积极分子”的称号。中国赫鲁晓夫把资本家及其老婆吹捧上了天，因为他们是他复辟资本主义的社会基础。
    在农业合作化运动中，毛主席对妇女运动作了许多英明指示。他说：“使全部妇女劳动力，在同工同酬的原则下，一律参加到劳动战线上去，这个要求，应当在尽可能短的时间内，予以实现。”又说：“真正的男女平等，只有在整个社会的社会主义改造过程中才能实现。”毛主席的指示，给广大劳动妇女极大的鼓舞，她们参加集体生产的积极性空前高涨。
    一九五六年十二月，全国妇联召开农村妇女工作座谈会。中国赫鲁晓夫通过他的爪牙，对这次会议做了黑指示。他们和毛主席《关于农业合作化问题》这一纲领性的文件相对抗，从妇女工作方面，大反农业合作化运动，大拆农业社会主义集体经济的台。他们胡说什么：“妇女不要多参加田间生产，不要和男劳力抢活干，搞家务劳动也同样具有社会价值。”他们还反对《全国农业发展纲要》上妇女生产劳动的时间不少于八十天到一百八十天的规定，叫嚷“这不是法律，七年以后做不到也不犯法”。全国妇联党内一小撮走资派紧紧跟上，以关心妇女的家务负担和农民家庭生活为名，在会上号召妇女大搞家庭副业，提倡发展私有经济。其目的就是反对农村劳动妇女走社会主义道路，使我国农村保留和发展个体经济，为复辟资本主义准备条件。
    一九五七年，国内外阶级斗争十分尖锐，资产阶级右派分子向党发动了猖狂进攻。在毛主席的亲自领导下，全党和全国人民对资产阶级右派进行了反击，取得了伟大的胜利。
    就在这年九月，中国赫鲁晓夫操纵下的全国第三次妇女代表大会召开了。这次大会不提学习毛主席著作，很少提反右派斗争和农村两条道路的斗争，却按照中国赫鲁晓夫的“指示”，把“勤俭建国，勤俭持家”作为“今后我国妇女运动的根本方针”。党内另一个最大的走资派也“指示”说：“妇联工作任何时候都不要忘记一个‘家’字。”这就为他们的“两勤”方针作了画龙点睛。把“勤俭持家”作为一项具体工作去抓，这是必要的。我们应当牢记毛主席的教导，时刻想到我国是一个社会主义大国，又是一个经济落后的穷国，我们要艰苦奋斗，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。但是，我们必须反对不顾国家利益和集体利益的个人主义，反对小生产者的“勤俭发家”。他们打着“红旗”反红旗，表面上说要“勤俭建国”，却片面地强调“勤俭持家”，实际上就是要妇女脱离三大革命运动，只关心小家庭的生活安排，关心自留地和家庭副业，走“发家致富”的资本主义道路。全国妇联党内一小撮走资派心领神会，便在“勤俭持家”方面大作文章。《中国妇女》杂志还开展了“勤俭持家”的专题讨论。他们极力把妇女群众的注意力吸引到家庭生活方面，让广大妇女为谋一家一户的私利而精打细算，以瓦解妇女群众的革命意志，使妇女工作围绕着资产阶级的“私”字打转转，走向资本主义的死胡同。
    一九五八年，全国人民在党的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，高举三面红旗，掀起了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的高潮，全国出现一片欣欣向荣的景象。广大劳动妇女冲破了党内最大的一小撮走资派设置的重重枷锁，意气风发、斗志昂扬，投入了大跃进的行列。一九六一年，正是我国遭到暂时困难的时刻，党内另一个最大的走资派在省、市、自治区妇联主任会议上，仍然顽固地把妇女群众的注意力吸引到家庭生活方面，进一步强调他们的“两勤方针，十年不变”。在这种错误思想的影响下，有些地方，“男集体女自由”，“男搞农业，女搞副业”，“吃饭靠集体，花钱靠自己”的歪风嚣张一时。在党的八届十中全会上毛主席发出“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，使广大劳动妇女眼更明，心更亮，坚决响应毛主席这一伟大号召，坚定地走社会主义道路。
    在妇女运动中，长期以来，一直贯串着两条路线的尖锐斗争。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线引导我们参加革命斗争，建立和巩固无产阶级专政，走社会主义道路。我们必须胸怀祖国，放眼世界。我们不但要进行本国的革命斗争，而且要积极支援全世界各国无产阶级争取解放的革命斗争。在当前，我们坚决响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义妇女运动路线，批倒批臭他的资产阶级的“妇女观点”、“福利观点”。中国赫鲁晓夫越是不准妇女革命，我们越要坚决走毛主席指引的革命道路。我们一定要努力活学活用毛主席著作，迅速全面落实毛主席的最新指示，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在妇女工作阵地上高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
