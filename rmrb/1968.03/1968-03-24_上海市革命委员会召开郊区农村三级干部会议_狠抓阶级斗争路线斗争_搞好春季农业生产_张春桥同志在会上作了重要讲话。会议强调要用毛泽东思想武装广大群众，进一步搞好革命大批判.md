The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee recently held a conference for rural three-level cadres in the suburbs. The conference called on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs to mobilize urgently and, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," swiftly launch a new high tide of spring agricultural production!

This conference, guided by the principle of "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self," repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, analyzed the new trends in class struggle in rural areas, and deployed work for spring agricultural production. Participants included representatives from the municipal, county, and commune levels, as well as some brigade cadres and representatives from the People's Liberation Army who are responsible for supporting the left and agriculture, totaling more than a thousand people. With boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, everyone linked the actual situation and their thoughts, discussing the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The entire conference was like an "anti-Japanese military and political university" style Mao Zedong Thought study class.

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, including Zhang Chunqiao, other members of the committee, and leaders from the Shanghai Garrison Command of the People's Liberation Army attended the conference. Zhang Chunqiao made an important speech at the conference.

The conference believed that the situation in Shanghai's suburban rural areas, like the rest of the country, is excellent. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are becoming more numerous and better organized. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is reaching a new high tide. The revolutionary criticism is being carried out more extensively and deeply. Revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination are becoming more consolidated and developed in the struggle. Most counties and communes have established revolutionary committees. Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in 1967, the suburbs achieved good harvests of grain, cotton, oil crops, and other economic crops. Judging from the current excellent situation of revolutionary production in the suburbs, there is great hope for a bumper harvest of summer crops and all-year-round crops.

The conference pointed out that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Further improving agricultural production in Shanghai's suburbs is not only closely related to industrial production and people's lives in the urban areas of Shanghai but also has great significance for the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the entire country.

Following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," the representatives at the conference analyzed the trends of class struggle in Shanghai's suburban rural areas. Everyone pointed out that although we have achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists do not accept their defeat. They are still trying every means to sabotage spring farming and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone agreed that to do a good job in this year's spring agricultural production, we must arm the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought, grasp class struggle, further carry out revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in rural areas.

The conference pointed out that establishing a strong, revolutionary, and combat-ready leadership cadre is the key to doing a good job in the revolution and production. Counties and communes that have established revolutionary committees should further empower the proletarian revolutionary factions and poor and lower-middle peasants to hold and use power. Counties and communes that have not yet established revolutionary committees should quickly establish and improve various levels of revolutionary production leadership cadres, take up the revolution and production, and strive to establish revolutionary committees as soon as possible. All revolutionary mass organizations should follow Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, correctly handle cadres, and help revolutionary cadres come forward to revolutionize. Revolutionary leading cadres at all levels should break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, be daring, and take root among the masses, closely fighting alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, grasping the revolution and promoting production, and creating new merits for the people.

Representatives from units related to agricultural production who attended the conference also firmly expressed their determination to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, strongly support agriculture, and better serve agricultural production.

Above all, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the most important. The conference called on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, further organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry out the thought revolution of the people, create a strong political atmosphere, raise class struggle and line struggle awareness, and boost revolutionary enthusiasm. Set ambitious goals, establish great aspirations, follow the Dazhai road, learn from the Dazhai people, and foster the Dazhai spirit. Grasp the revolution, promote production, fight the spring agricultural production battle, strive for a greater harvest in all-year-round agriculture, and for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    上海市革命委员会召开郊区农村三级干部会议
    狠抓阶级斗争路线斗争　搞好春季农业生产
    张春桥同志在会上作了重要讲话。会议强调要用毛泽东思想武装广大群众，进一步搞好革命大批判
    新华社上海二十三日电　上海市革命委员会最近召开的郊区农村三级干部会议，号召郊区广大贫下中农和革命干部紧急动员起来，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，迅速掀起春季农业生产新高潮！
    这次会议以“斗私，批修”为纲，反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，分析了当前农村阶级斗争的新动向，部署了春季农业生产工作。参加会议的有市、县、公社代表和部分大队干部以及担负支左、支农任务的解放军代表共一千多人。大家怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的感情，联系实际，联系思想，畅谈了毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，畅谈了无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势。整个会议，就是一个活学活用毛泽东思想的“抗大”式的毛泽东思想学习班。
    上海市革命委员会负责人张春桥同志、市革命委员会其他领导成员和人民解放军上海警备区负责人出席了大会。张春桥同志在会上作了重要讲话。
    会议认为，上海郊区农村和全国一样，形势大好。毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好。活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新高潮。革命的大批判，正在更加广泛、深入地开展。革命的大联合和革命的三结合，在斗争中日益巩固和发展。大部分县、社已经建立了革命委员会。在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，一九六七年，郊区粮食、棉花、油料及其它经济作物获得了好收成。从当前郊区的革命生产大好形势看，夺取夏熟和全年农作物的丰收大有希望。
    会议指出，农业是国民经济的基础。进一步搞好上海郊区的农业生产，不仅对上海市区的工业生产和人民生活有着十分密切的关系，而且，对全国社会主义革命和社会主义建设也具有十分重大的意义。
    到会代表遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，分析了上海郊区农村阶级斗争的动向。大家指出，我们虽然已经取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，但是，一小撮特务、叛徒、死不悔改的走资派和社会上没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，并不甘心他们的失败，他们还在千方百计地大搞破坏活动，妄图破坏春耕生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。大家认为，要搞好今年的春季农业生产，一定要用毛泽东思想武装广大群众，狠抓阶级斗争，进一步搞好革命的大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在农村散布的反革命修正主义流毒。
    会议指出，建立一个坚强的、革命化、战斗化的领导班子，是搞好革命、抓好生产的关键。已经建立革命委员会的县、社，要进一步为无产阶级革命派和贫下中农掌好权，用好权。还没有建立革命委员会的县、社，要迅速建立和健全各级革命生产领导班子，把革命、生产抓起来，并且争取早日建立革命委员会。各革命群众组织要按照毛主席的干部政策，正确对待干部，帮助革命干部站出来革命。各级革命领导干部，要破私立公，“敢”字当头，扎根在群众之中，紧紧地和贫下中农战斗在一起，抓革命，促生产，为人民立新功。
    出席会议的与农业生产有关单位的代表，也坚决表示要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，大力支援农业，更好地为农业生产服务。
    千重要，万重要，活学活用毛泽东思想最重要。大会号召郊区广大贫下中农和革命干部，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，进一步办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，搞好人的思想革命化，把政治空气搞得浓浓的，把阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟提得高高的，把革命干劲鼓得足足的。树雄心，立壮志，走大寨路，学大寨人，树大寨风。狠抓革命，猛促生产，打好春季农业生产这一仗，为夺取全年农业的更大丰收，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋勇前进！
