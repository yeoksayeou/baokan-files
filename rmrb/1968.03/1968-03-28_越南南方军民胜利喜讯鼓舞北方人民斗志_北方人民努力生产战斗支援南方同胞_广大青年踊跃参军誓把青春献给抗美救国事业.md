The recent victories of the military and civilians in South Vietnam have greatly inspired the people of North Vietnam. They are redoubling their efforts in production, strengthening their combat readiness, and eagerly enlisting in the military to support their compatriots in the South in their struggle against American aggression. They are determined to achieve a complete victory over the American invaders, liberate the South, and reunify the country.

Recently, our correspondent visited several factories, shops, and agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Hanoi. Everywhere, one could see inspiring slogans such as "Learn from the heroic South Vietnamese military and civilians!" "Celebrate the New Year victories of the heroic South Vietnamese military and civilians!" "Everything for the complete defeat of American aggressors!" "Everything for the frontline!" The workers at the Hanoi Shipyard launched a production competition to celebrate the victories of the South Vietnamese military and civilians, pledging to build more pontoon bridges to meet transportation needs. The workers innovated and improved production techniques, significantly increasing production efficiency. Nguyen Van Thuan, the trade union chairman of the shipyard, said, "Our comrades on the frontline have achieved great victories in the struggle against American aggression. We in the rear must ensure that when enemy planes come, we fight them; when they leave, we speed up production to meet transportation needs."

The workers at the Hanoi Red River Stationery Factory linked their production to the struggle of the South Vietnamese military and civilians, working day and night without complaint. The workers in the grinding department, who previously could only grind 400 pen tips per person per day, now grind 700. The administrative staff of the factory work in the morning and participate in production to support the South in the afternoon.

The members of the Viet-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Hanoi launched a production competition called "Defeating American Aggressors in the Fields." The members, with the resolve to decisively defeat the American invaders, work hard, going out early and returning late, increasing production efficiency by 10% compared to before. Female militia member Le Thi Tu said, "Women in the South have shown great courage and tenacity in fighting against the American puppets. We must learn from their fighting spirit, do a good job in production, and strengthen our combat readiness."

The female saleswomen at the No. 5 Shop on Nam Buu Road in Hanoi, inspired by the New Year victories in the South, decided to do their work better, fight bravely, and compete with their sisters in the South.

The young people of North Vietnam, while strengthening production and combat readiness, are eagerly enlisting in the military, pledging to dedicate their youth to the great cause of resisting American aggression and saving the nation. In some factories, 100% of the youth have applied to enlist. Those approved to enlist are overjoyed, while those not yet approved have expressed their determination to work hard, strengthen their physical fitness, and be ready to rush to the battlefield to fight the enemy and save the nation as soon as the country needs them. The female militia members of the Viet-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative also expressed that they would rush to the frontline as soon as Chairman Ho gives the order.

The broad masses of farmers in North Vietnam are fighting while producing, actively engaging in agricultural construction and improving agricultural technology, and achieving another bumper harvest of grain.

    据新华社河内二十六日电　本社记者报道：越南南方军民取得的新春大捷，极大地鼓舞了越南北方人民。他们正在加倍努力生产，加强战斗，踊跃参军，以实际行动坚决支援南方同胞的抗美救国斗争，为彻底战胜美国侵略者，解放南方，统一祖国而奋斗。
    最近，记者访问了河内的一些工厂、商店和郊区农业生产合作社，到处看到“学习英雄的南方军民！”“欢呼英雄的南方军民新春大捷！”“一切为了彻底战胜美国侵略强盗！”“一切为了前线！”等鼓舞人心的标语口号。河内造船厂的工人们为了祝贺南方军民的新春胜利，发动了生产竞赛运动，保证多制造浮桥，满足交通运输需要。工人们动脑筋，想办法，改进生产技术，大大提高了生产效率。这家工厂的工会书记阮文琮说：“前线的同志们在抗美救国斗争中取得了巨大胜利，我们在后方一定要做到敌机来了就打；敌机走了就加紧生产，保证交通运输的需要”。
    河内红河文具厂的工人，把自己的生产同南方军民的斗争紧密联系起来，不怕苦，不怕累，夜以继日地劳动。磨圆组的工人，过去每人每天只能磨笔尖四百个，现在提高到磨七百个。这家工厂的行政人员上午办公，下午就参加支援南方的生产劳动。
    河内郊区越中友好农业社社员发动了名为“在田野里战胜美国强盗”的生产竞赛运动。社员们都以决战决胜美国侵略强盗的意志努力生产，早出晚归，生产效率比过去提高百分之十。女民兵梁氏七说：“南方妇女在反击美伪集团的斗争中，表现得非常英勇顽强。我们一定努力学习她们的斗争精神，搞好生产，加强战斗。”
    河内市南部路五号商店的女售货员们在南方新春大捷的鼓舞下，决心把工作做得更好，勇敢战斗，同南方姐妹们展开竞赛。
    越南北方的广大青年在加强生产和战斗的同时，纷纷报名参军，誓把自己的青春献给伟大的抗美救国事业。有的工厂百分之百的青年都申请参军。被批准参军的人，个个兴高采烈，暂时未被批准的人，都表示安心生产，加强锻炼身体，只要祖国需要，就马上奔赴战场，杀敌救国。越中友好农业合作社的女民兵们也表示，一旦胡主席一声令下，她们就马上奔赴前线。（附图片）
    越南北方广大农民，边战斗边生产，积极进行农田建设和改进农业技术，粮食生产又获丰收。
