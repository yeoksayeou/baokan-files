The memorial hall dedicated to the great leader Chairman Mao's good soldier, martyr Liu Yingjun, opened on March 15th in the western suburbs of Jiamusi City, at the Yingjun Martyrs' Cemetery.

March 15th marked the second anniversary of Liu Yingjun's martyrdom. On this day, over 40,000 military personnel and civilians from Jiamusi City participated in the opening ceremony of the Liu Yingjun Martyr Memorial Hall and the meeting to learn from Liu Yingjun. They resolved to be inspired and driven by Liu Yingjun's brilliant deeds of unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the main hall of the memorial, a full-body statue of Chairman Mao stands prominently. The many photographs and personal items on display, including Liu Yingjun's copies of Chairman Mao's four volumes of selected works, his diaries, notebooks, letters, and articles, vividly reflect his unwavering loyalty to the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and his dedication to applying Chairman Mao's invincible thought. They also reflect his highest level of consciousness and greatest enthusiasm in propagating Mao Zedong Thought to his comrades, relatives, and the broad masses of people, and his moving deeds of vowing to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

After visiting the memorial, the broad revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army soldiers said: Liu Yingjun is good in every way, but his best quality is his active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. To learn from Liu Yingjun, we must, like him, with deep proletarian feelings, study Mao Zedong Thought without a moment's pause, propagate Mao Zedong Thought without a second's rest, execute Mao Zedong Thought without the slightest deviation, and defend Mao Zedong Thought without the slightest waver.

Leaders from the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the Hejiang Regional Revolutionary Committee, the Jiamusi City Revolutionary Committee, and Liu Yingjun's former unit attended the opening ceremony and the meeting. The Hejiang Regional Revolutionary Committee and the Jiamusi City Revolutionary Committee also made decisions to further promote the learning of Liu Yingjun's spirit.

On the same day, over 5,000 military personnel and civilians from Liu Yingjun's hometown, Changchun, also held a meeting to learn from Liu Yingjun.
