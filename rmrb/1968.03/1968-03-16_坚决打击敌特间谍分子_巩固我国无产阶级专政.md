The British imperialist intelligence agency, using the British "Vickers-Gimma Company" as a cover for trade, has sent spy elements to brazenly gather military, political, economic, and cultural revolution intelligence from our country. The company has also engaged in economic and technological fraud, seriously endangering our country's security and disrupting our socialist economic construction. The public security organs of Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, have sentenced the British spy George Watt to three years' imprisonment and expelled another spy element, Peter Dickett, from the country. This is a powerful measure taken by the Chinese government to maintain national sovereignty, safeguard national security, protect the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and consolidate proletarian dictatorship. It is a severe punishment for foreign spy elements who dare to engage in sabotage and disruptive activities in our country.

Our country is a great socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We have always pursued friendly cooperation with the peoples of all countries, but we will not allow any domestic or foreign enemies to take advantage of the situation to engage in counter-revolutionary activities in our country. For all enemies who engage in espionage, subversion, and sabotage activities in our country, endangering our national security, regardless of which country's passport they hold or what disguise they wear, the Chinese government will certainly exercise the power of the proletarian dictatorship and punish them severely.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their defeat in China. They will collude with each other and use all possible means to oppose the Chinese people."

For a long time, imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries from various countries have never stopped their plots of subversion and sabotage against our country. They not only collude with and utilize a small handful of class enemies within our country but also continuously send various spies and special agents, using legal cover, to infiltrate and engage in various evil activities. Especially since our country launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, domestic and foreign class enemies, on the one hand, out of fear and hatred of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and on the other hand, thinking there is an opportunity, have tried to fish in troubled waters, and have crazily intensified their espionage and subversion activities. The exposure of this British spy case once again tells us: The imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries from various countries will not change their counter-revolutionary nature.

At present, the people of our country, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, are striving to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not, because of victory, relax our vigilance against the cunning revenge plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will be disarmed politically and put in a passive position." Every revolutionary of the proletariat, every revolutionary comrade, must firmly remember this teaching of our great leader, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, heighten vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen the awareness of enemy situations, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, and root out all hidden American, Chiang Kai-shek, Soviet revisionist, British, Japanese spies... and not let a single one escape. We must resolutely and thoroughly smash all their plots, consolidate our country's proletarian dictatorship, and ensure the comprehensive victory of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　坚决打击敌特间谍分子
    巩固我国无产阶级专政

    英帝国主义情报机关通过英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”，以贸易为掩护，派遣间谍分子，猖狂地刺探我国的军事、政治、经济和无产阶级文化大革命等重要情报，该公司并在经济技术上进行诈骗，严重地危害了我们祖国的安全，破坏了我国的社会主义经济建设。我国甘肃省兰州市专政机关，依法判处英国间谍乔治·瓦特有期徒刑三年，并将另一名从事间谍活动的分子彼德·迪卡特驱逐出境。这是我国政府为维护国家主权、保卫国家安全、保卫无产阶级文化大革命，巩固无产阶级专政所采取的有力措施。这是对胆敢在我国进行破坏和捣乱活动的外国间谍分子的严厉惩罚。
    我国是一个无产阶级专政的伟大的社会主义国家。我们一贯地同世界各国人民实行友好合作，但是，决不允许任何国内外敌人乘机在我国进行反革命活动。对于一切在我国进行间谍、颠覆、破坏活动，危害我们国家安全的敌人，不管他拿着哪一个国家的护照，披着什么式样的外衣，我国政府都一定要行使无产阶级专政的权力，严惩不贷。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。”
    长期以来，以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派，从未停止过对我国的颠覆阴谋和破坏活动。他们不仅勾结和利用我国国内一小撮阶级敌人，而且不断派遣形形色色的间谍特务，利用合法的外衣，钻进来从事各种罪恶勾当。特别是自从我国开展无产阶级文化大革命以来，国内外的阶级敌人，一方面出于对我国无产阶级文化大革命的恐惧和仇恨，另一方面以为有机可趁，企图混水摸鱼，更是疯狂地加紧了他们的间谍、颠覆活动。这次英国间谍案的破获，再一次告诉我们：帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，他们的反革命本性是不会改变的。
    目前，我国人民正在伟大领袖毛主席的英明指引下夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。毛主席教导说：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”每一个无产阶级革命派，每一个革命同志必须牢牢记住我们伟大领袖的这一教导，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，百倍提高警惕，加强敌情观念，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，把暗藏的美蒋特务、苏修特务、英国特务、日本特务……统统揪出来，一个也不放过，坚决彻底粉碎他们的一切阴谋，巩固我国无产阶级专政，保证我国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
