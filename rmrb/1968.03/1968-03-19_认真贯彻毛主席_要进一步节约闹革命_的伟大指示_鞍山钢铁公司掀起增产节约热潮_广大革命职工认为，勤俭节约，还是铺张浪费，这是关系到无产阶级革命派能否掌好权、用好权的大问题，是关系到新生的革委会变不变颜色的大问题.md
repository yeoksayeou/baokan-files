Anshan Iron and Steel Company Launches a Production and Savings Campaign

The broad revolutionary masses of workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company believe that whether to practice thrift or waste is a major issue concerning whether the proletarian revolutionary faction can properly exercise power and use it well. It is also a major issue concerning whether the newly born revolutionary committee will change color.

New China News Agency, Anshan, March 18—Under the strong assistance of the PLA's support-leftist troops, the broad revolutionary masses of workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company are seriously implementing and carrying out Chairman Mao's great directives of "building the country through thrift" and "further saving and making revolution." They use revolution to lead production, increase production while remembering to save, and explore every possible way to tap into savings potential, launching a new high tide of production and savings.

The revolutionary masses of workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company believe that whether to implement or not to implement Chairman Mao's great directives of "building the country through thrift" and "further saving and making revolution" is an important manifestation of loyalty or disloyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty or disloyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty or disloyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Saving and making revolution is a major matter of preventing revisionism and avoiding capitalist restoration. Now, the revolutionary masses of workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company are discussing the great significance of "saving and making revolution" and "managing the factory through thrift" in their study sessions on applying Chairman Mao's works, on big-character posters, and on blackboard newspapers. They are determined to resolutely fight against the bourgeois wasteful behavior and "young master" attitude, thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, and forever establish the fine tradition of "saving is glorious, wasting is shameful," striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The revolutionary workers in various steelmaking plants are currently carrying out a campaign of learning from each other, helping each other, and catching up with each other, with the content of shortening the smelting time, producing more high-quality steel, and reducing fuel consumption. The No. 9 open-hearth furnace at the No. 1 Steel Plant, which is ahead of all its sister furnaces, created a new record of producing four furnaces of steel per day on the 13th. This is a rare achievement in the large open-hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel Company since the Great Leap Forward. Since March, due to the significant reduction in smelting time, this plant has saved a large amount of fuel.

The revolutionary masses of workers at the power plant, which is responsible for the entire power supply of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, are brainstorming and offering suggestions in the tide of saving and making revolution. They have eliminated the unreasonable phenomena of "big horse pulling a small cart" and idling transformers by breaking old conventions and changing the power supply methods, saving the country 121,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity every day. Last November, this plant organized a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team for saving electricity, which went deep into 26 key factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and residential areas to propagate. Wherever they went, they first propagated Chairman Mao's great policy of "saving and making revolution," explaining the great significance of saving electricity. With their help, all factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have fully mobilized the masses, found ways, tapped potentials, and formulated reasonable measures for electricity use, saving a large amount of electricity.

Currently, the revolutionary committees of many factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have listed saving and making revolution as an important agenda item, frequently discussing and studying it, and paying attention to doing a good job in this regard. They say that whether to practice thrift or waste is a major issue concerning whether the proletarian revolutionary faction can properly exercise power and use it well. It is also a major issue concerning whether the newly born revolutionary committee will change color. We absolutely cannot treat it lightly. Most factories and mines' revolutionary committees have mobilized the masses to discuss the issue of saving and making revolution, proposing practical measures. The revolutionary committee of the Chemical General Plant, by taking measures and insisting on saving and making revolution, and organizing more than 80% of the revolutionary committee's staff to go to the production front line, leading the workers to do a good job in saving, has made the entire plant present a new situation where waste has someone to manage, saving has someone to praise, advanced has someone to learn from, and backward has someone to help. The Electric Repair Plant is the unit with the highest copper consumption in Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The workers of this plant, through adopting methods such as utilizing waste materials, have already been able to self-supply 30% of the copper materials for the entire plant. Many revolutionary workers of various factories and mines also carry forward the spirit of the master of the state, starting from the big picture and the small details, saving for the state everywhere. Many workers in the welding pipe rolling mill carry sewing kits, and when their gloves and work clothes are torn, they mend them themselves.

To further implement saving and making revolution, the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have also timely helped the leaders and revolutionary workers of various factories and mines to seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, raise their awareness of properly exercising financial power for the revolution, criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism, guard the financial and economic gate, and establish and improve reasonable financial and economic systems.

　　认真贯彻毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示
　　鞍山钢铁公司掀起增产节约热潮
    广大革命职工认为，勤俭节约，还是铺张浪费，这是关系到无产阶级革命派能否掌好权、用好权的大问题，是关系到新生的革委会变不变颜色的大问题
    新华社鞍山十八日电　鞍山钢铁公司的广大革命职工，在解放军支左部队的大力帮助下，认真贯彻落实毛主席“勤俭建国”和
  “要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，以革命统帅生产，增产不忘节约，千方百计挖掘节约潜力，掀起了增产节约的新高潮。
    鞍钢广大革命职工认为，执行不执行毛主席“勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，是忠不忠于毛主席、忠不忠于毛泽东思想、忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一个重要表现。节约闹革命，是防止修正主义，避免资本主义复辟的大事。现在，鞍钢的广大革命职工在活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会上，在大字报和黑板报上，都大谈“节约闹革命”和“勤俭办工厂”的重大意义。他们决心同资产阶级的铺张浪费行为和“大少爷”作风作坚决斗争，彻底肃清反革命经济主义的流毒，永远树立起“节约光荣，浪费可耻”的好风尚，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而努力！
    各炼钢厂的革命职工正在开展以缩短熔炼时间，多生产优质钢和降低燃料消耗为内容的比学赶帮活动。跑在各兄弟平炉前边的第一炼钢厂九号平炉，十三日创造了日出四炉钢的新纪录。这是从大跃进以来，在鞍钢大型平炉中，很少有的成绩。三月份以来，由于熔炼时间的大大缩短，这个厂节约了大量的燃料。
    担负整个鞍钢电力供应的供电厂的广大革命职工，在节约闹革命的热潮中，人人开动脑筋，献计献策。他们通过破除旧框框，改变电力供应“大马拉小车”和变压器空运等不合理现象，每天给国家节约的电力达十二万一千多度。这个厂的革命职工在去年十一月，曾经组织了一支节电毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到鞍钢二十六个重点厂矿和家属住宅区，进行宣传。他们每到一处，首先宣传的是毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大方针，说明节约用电的重大意义。在他们的帮助下，鞍钢各个厂矿，都充分发动群众，找门路，挖潜力，制订出合理的用电措施，节约了大量电力。
    目前，鞍钢许多厂矿的革命委员会都把节约闹革命，列为重要的议事日程，经常讨论研究，注意抓好这项工作。他们说，是勤俭节约，还是铺张浪费，这是关系到无产阶级革命派能否掌好权、用好权的大问题，是关系到新诞生的革命委员会变不变颜色的大问题，我们绝不能等闲视之。大部分厂矿的革命委员会都发动群众讨论节约闹革命的问题，提出切实可行的措施。化工总厂革命委员会，由于采取措施，坚持节约闹革命，并且组织了百分之八十以上的革委会工作人员深入到生产第一线，带领职工搞好节约工作，全厂出现了浪费有人管，节约有人夸，先进有人学，后进有人帮的新气象。电修厂，是鞍钢耗铜量最多的单位。这个厂的职工通过采取利用废旧材料等办法，全厂百分之三十的铜料已经可以自给。不少厂矿的革命职工还发扬国家主人翁的精神，从大处着眼，小处着手，处处为国家节约。焊管厂轧钢车间很多职工身上都带着针线包，手套和劳作服坏了，自己就动手缝补。
    为了进一步实行节约闹革命，驻鞍钢各厂矿的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，还及时帮助各厂、矿的领导干部和革命职工认真学习毛主席的有关教导，提高为革命掌好财权的认识，斗私批修，把好财经关，建立和健全了合理的财经制度。
