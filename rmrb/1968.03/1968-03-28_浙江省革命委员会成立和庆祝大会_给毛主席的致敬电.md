	To the Most Respected and Beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao:

	The 31 million military and civilian people of Zhejiang, who are eternally loyal to you, are filled with revolutionary fervor and joyfully report to you, the brightest red sun in our hearts: The Zhejiang Revolutionary Committee, which you personally approved, has been born in glory amidst the stormy class struggle!

	Respected Chairman Mao! We celebrate your brilliant victory of thought! We sing a triumphant song for your proletarian revolutionary line! We praise the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army, which you personally created and led!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is your brilliant thoughts that have given us the soul of revolution; it is your great teachings that have imparted to us a new proletarian youth. We love you, believe in you, worship you, and are loyal to you without limits! A million red hearts resonate with a single voice: We sincerely wish you, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

	Respected Chairman Mao! It is you who have armed our minds with the great theory of contradictions, class, and class struggle in socialist society; it is you who have illuminated our path forward with the brilliant theory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Right here, in the place where you have directed many major political campaigns, Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang attempted to restore capitalism. In the early days of agricultural collectivization, they slashed 15,000 agricultural cooperatives. They glorified capitalism, calling the suffering of the laboring people and the debauchery of the bourgeoisie "paradise." Over there, they shouted, "Whether it's a white cat or a black cat, as long as it catches mice, it's a good cat." Here, they clamored, "What socialism, what communism, as long as you have a full stomach, it's a good ideology." In reality, they wanted the rich peasants and capitalists to get rich. Can we allow these reactionary elements to succeed in their plot to restore capitalism? No! No! Absolutely not! Can we allow these counter-revolutionary capitalist-roaders to change the color of our Party and country? No! No! Absolutely not!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is you who personally ignited the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With the order from the supreme commander, we rushed to the battlefield. From the breakthrough you personally opened in the headquarters of Chinese Khrushchev, we launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Zhejiang! We navigated through rapid currents and hidden reefs, repelling the enemy's repeated ferocious counterattacks; we subdued tigers and eagles, shattering their evil plots to restore capitalism; we exposed the "snake disguised as a beautiful woman" and rooted out the "snake baring its fangs." After repeated struggles, we finally achieved a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Respected Chairman Mao! It is you who issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left. The PLA units stationed in Zhejiang stood firm and clear, stepping forward at critical moments to become the strong backbone of the proletarian revolutionaries. The powerful army, navy, and air force guard the frontline of the East China Sea day and night. The communist warrior Cai Yongqiang bravely sacrificed himself at the Qiantang River Bridge. The PLA units in Zhejiang and the proletarian revolutionaries fought side by side, sharing life and death.

	Respected Chairman Mao! At every difficult juncture, it is you who have repeatedly shown us your affectionate care; at every critical moment, it is you who have repeatedly given us your wise instructions. Through countless severe tests and twists and turns in the struggle, it is you who have given us courage, confidence, wisdom, and strength! Making our hearts redder, our eyes brighter, and our iron bones stronger! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Every victory we achieve is a crystallization of your brilliant thoughts! Every step we advance is guided by your personal leadership!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! At the crucial moment of our decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you personally inspected Zhejiang, giving us a series of extremely important new instructions. This is the most affectionate care, the deepest education, the most powerful encouragement, and the greatest inspiration for us! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your great teachings have become the conscious actions of the revolutionary people of Zhejiang, generating boundless material force. Following your teachings, we have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the province, opening up the battlefield of "criticizing self and criticizing revisionism." We have swiftly launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and industrial and agricultural production.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will definitely hold high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," fully implement your series of new instructions, and strive forward to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We will definitely continue to set up and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, strengthen education on the struggle between the two lines, and carry out revolutionary criticism, struggle, and reform more broadly and deeply; develop and consolidate revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination; grasp revolution and promote production, economize for revolution, and further launch a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production.

	Respected Chairman Mao! We will definitely rely on your brilliant thoughts to hold and use the power of the proletariat, firmly remembering your affectionate teachings: "Class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment are the three great revolutionary movements for building a powerful socialist state, and are the reliable guarantees for communists to avoid bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism, and stand unshakable; they are the reliable guarantees for the proletariat to unite with the broad masses of laboring people and implement democratic dictatorship." We will definitely never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, never forget highlighting proletarian politics, and never forget holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying your brilliant thoughts more broadly and deeply throughout the province, diligently read your books, honestly listen to your words, strictly follow your instructions, and loyally be your good soldiers. We vow to turn Zhejiang into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, letting your brilliant thoughts' great red flag fly high and forever on the coast of the East China Sea!

	Respected Chairman Mao! We will definitely follow your teachings: "On a larger scale, launch a fervent movement of supporting the army and loving the people," further strengthen military-civilian unity, heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and shatter all plots and sabotage by the U.S. imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits, making the southeastern coast stand as a red Great Wall. We will resolutely execute your order: "Spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy." If they come by water, we fight them in the water; if they come by land, we fight them on the land; if they come by air, we fight them in the air; we will decisively, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly annihilate all enemies who dare to invade.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the helmsman of the great ocean voyage, the lighthouse of human liberation, the guide of communism, and the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We are proud to fight in your era and proud to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the world revolution!

	We sing the song of praise to you every day and pass on your great thoughts to future generations! Let us once again express our best wishes to you: Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, great helmsman, the brightest red sun in our hearts, live forever! Live forever! Live forever!

    给毛主席的致敬电最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    永远忠于您的浙江省三千一百万军民，满怀革命豪情，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳报喜：您亲自批准的浙江省革命委员会，在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中光荣诞生了！
    敬爱的毛主席！我们欢呼您光辉思想的又一个伟大胜利！我们高唱您的无产阶级革命路线的又一曲嘹亮凯歌！我们颂扬您亲自缔造和领导的人民解放军的又一丰功伟绩！
    毛主席呀，毛主席！是您的光辉思想，给了我们革命的灵魂；是您的伟大教导，赋予我们新的无产阶级青春。我们对您无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚！千万颗红心迸发出一个共同的声音：衷心地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
      敬爱的毛主席！是您，用社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的伟大学说武装了我们的头脑；是您，用无产阶级文化大革命的光辉理论照亮了我们前进的道路。就在这里——您老人家指挥过多次重大政治战役的地方，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江的代理人妄图实现资本主义复辟，曾经在农业合作化初期，就一刀砍去一万五千个农业社。他们美化资本主义，把劳动人民饥寒交迫和资产阶级荒淫无耻的生活叫做“天堂”。那边叫嚣：“不管白猫黑猫，能捉老鼠就是好猫”，这里喧嚷：“什么社会主义，什么共产主义，吃饱肚皮就是好主义”，实际上就是要让富农和资本家大发其财。我们能让这些反动家伙复辟资本主义的阴谋得逞吗？不能！不能！绝对不能！我们能让这些反革命的走资派改变我们党和国家的颜色吗？不能！不能！绝对不能！
      毛主席呀，毛主席！是您，亲手点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。最高统帅一声令下，我们就上了战场，从您亲自轰开的中国赫鲁晓夫黑司令部的突破口冲过去，向浙江省党内一小撮走资派发起猛烈攻击！渡急流，绕暗礁，打退了阶级敌人一次又一次的猖狂反扑；驱虎豹，缚鲲鹏，粉碎了他们复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋；识破了“化成美女的蛇”，揪出了“露出毒牙的蛇”。经过反复较量，我们终于取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    敬爱的毛主席！是您，发出了“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，人民解放军驻浙部队，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，在关键时刻挺身而出，做了无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。强大的陆海空三军日夜守卫着东海前哨，共产主义战士蔡永祥英勇献身在钱江桥畔。人民解放军驻浙部队和无产阶级革命派，并肩战斗，生死与共。
    敬爱的毛主席！在每一个困难关头，都是您一次又一次的给我们亲切关怀；在每一个关键时刻，都是您一次又一次的给我们英明指示。多少次严峻的考验，多少回曲折的斗争，都是您给了我们勇气，给了我们信心，给了我们智慧，给了我们力量！使得我们心更红，眼更亮，铮铮铁骨更坚强！毛主席呀，毛主席！我们的每一个战果，都是您光辉思想的结晶！我们每前进一步，都是您亲手指引！
      毛主席呀，毛主席！在我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命决定性胜利的关键时刻，您亲临浙江视察，给了我们一系列极为重要的最新指示。这是对我们最亲切的关怀，最深刻的教育，最有力的鞭策，最巨大的鼓舞！毛主席呀，毛主席！您的伟大教导变成了浙江革命人民的自觉行动，产生了无穷无尽的物质力量。我们遵照您的教导，大办毛泽东思想学习班，在全省摆开了“斗私，批修”的战场，批判资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，迅速掀起了革命大批判的高潮，革命大联合的高潮，革命三结合的高潮，工农业生产的高潮。
    毛主席呀，毛主席！我们一定更高举起您光辉思想的伟大红旗，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，全面落实您的一系列最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋勇前进！我们一定继续大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，加强两条路线斗争教育，把革命的大批判和斗批改开展得更加广泛、更加深入；革命的大联合和革命的三结合更加发展、更加巩固；狠抓革命，猛促生产，节约闹革命，进一步掀起工农业生产的新高潮。
      敬爱的毛主席！我们一定依靠您的光辉思想掌好无产阶级的权、用好无产阶级的权，牢牢记住您的亲切教导：“阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是建设社会主义强大国家的三项伟大革命运动，是使共产党人免除官僚主义、避免修正主义和教条主义，永远立于不败之地的确实保证，是使无产阶级能够和广大劳动群众联合起来，实行民主专政的可靠保证。”我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。我们一定要在全省更加广泛、更加深入地开展活学活用您的光辉思想的伟大群众运动，孜孜不倦地读您的书，老老实实地听您的话，不折不扣地照您的指示办事，忠心耿耿地做您的好战士。我们誓把浙江办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，让您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，在祖国东海岸高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
    敬爱的毛主席！我们一定遵照您的教导：“更大规模地展开热烈的拥军爱民运动”，进一步加强军民团结，提高警惕，加强战备，粉碎美帝、蒋匪的一切阴谋破坏，使东南海疆屹立起红色长城。我们坚决执行您的命令：“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌。”水上来，水上打；地上来，地上打；天上来，天上打；坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭一切胆敢来犯的敌人。
      毛主席呀，毛主席！您是大海航行的舵手，人类解放的灯塔，共产主义的引路人，革命人民心中的红太阳！毛主席呀，毛主席！我们以战斗在您的时代而感到幸福，以肩负世界革命的重任而感到自豪！
      我们把献给您的颂歌天天唱，把您的伟大思想代代传！让我们再一次向您表达最良好的祝愿：我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    浙江省革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
