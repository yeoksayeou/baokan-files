In recent days, thrilling reports of victory have been continuously coming from the battlefields of Laos. After the great victory at Nam Bao, the patriotic military and civilian people of Laos have shown an indomitable spirit, fearlessly fighting the enemy and achieving tremendous results. The heroic struggles of the Lao patriotic forces have dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, bringing about a new situation in the Lao people's war of resistance against American aggression.

Over the past few years, U.S. imperialism has continuously expanded its aggression against Laos. It has heavily supported and armed the right-wing forces in Laos and directly sent large numbers of military personnel to command the war of aggression. It has also frequently sent warplanes to bomb the liberated areas of Laos. However, the patriotic military and civilian people of Laos have remained undaunted and grown stronger in battle, repeatedly repelling the attacks of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. This year, the patriotic forces of Laos have fought a series of brilliant battles. They have liberated several important strongholds, foiled the enemy's plot to "eat away" at the liberated areas, and greatly consolidated and expanded the liberated zones.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "In a protracted and bitter war, guerrilla warfare will display tremendous power, and it is indeed a matter of no small consequence." The brilliant victories of the Lao people in their war of resistance against American aggression have powerfully proven this truth.

In the past year, the patriotic military and civilian people of Laos fought over 1,800 battles with the enemy, annihilating nearly 16,000 enemy troops. In the first two months of this year, the patriotic forces of Laos fought over 100 battles, annihilating and dispersing more than 5,000 enemy troops. In this way, the Lao people have demonstrated the great power of guerrilla warfare, gradually consuming the enemy. By persisting in this manner, accumulating small victories into great victories, they can gradually change the balance of power between the enemy and themselves, ultimately defeating U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

U.S. imperialism has suffered repeated defeats on the battlefields of Vietnam and is facing imminent disaster. On the battlefields of Laos, it has also been repeatedly beaten and is in a very awkward situation. However, it is not yet ready to give up and is desperately struggling. The Johnson administration, in an attempt to extricate itself from the predicament in Laos and save the failing war in Vietnam, is hastening to plan new military adventures in Indochina, plotting direct intervention and sending Thai reactionary forces to invade Laos. The Soviet revisionist clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, is closely coordinating with the Lao reactionaries, attempting to strangle the revolutionary struggles of the Lao people and the entire Indochinese people. However, all the struggles of the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys will only hasten their own doom.

The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front recently issued a solemn call: "The Lao people of all ethnic groups must seize the current favorable situation, advance in victory, and annihilate the enemy." The heroic Lao people, by strengthening their struggle and persisting, will surely achieve final victory in their war of resistance against American aggression. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, pledge to be the staunch backbone of the Lao people, resolutely supporting the Lao people in their war of resistance against American aggression to the end, and completing the great cause of national liberation!

    老挝人民乘胜前进
    本报评论员
    最近，从老挝战场不断传来振奋人心的捷报。老挝爱国军民在南博大捷以后，发扬了不怕疲劳和连续作战的精神，广泛袭击敌人，取得了巨大的战果。老挝爱国军民的英勇战斗，沉重地打击了美帝国主义及其走狗，使老挝人民的抗美救国战争出现了新局面。
    几年来，美帝国主义不断扩大对老挝的侵略战争。它大力扶植和武装老挝右派军队，并且直接派遣大量军事人员指挥侵略战争，不断出动强盗飞机轰炸老挝解放区。但是，老挝爱国军民英勇不屈，越战越强，接连挫败了美帝国主义及其走狗的进攻。今年以来，老挝爱国军民打了一连串的漂亮仗。他们解放了不少重要据点，粉碎了敌人“蚕食”解放区的阴谋，大大地巩固并扩大了解放区。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席指出：“在长期和残酷的战争中，游击战争将表现其很大的威力，实在是非同小可的事业。”老挝人民抗美救国战争的辉煌胜利，有力地证明了这个真理。
    在去年一年中，老挝爱国军民同敌人进行了一千八百多次战斗，歼敌近一万六千名。今年头两个月，老挝爱国军民作战百余次，又消灭和瓦解敌军五千多名。老挝人民就是这样发挥了游击战的巨大威力，把敌人一口一口地吃掉。这样长期坚持下去，积小胜为大胜，就能逐步改变敌我力量的对比，最后彻底打败美帝国主义及其走狗。
    美帝国主义在越南战场上一败再败，面临着灭顶之灾，在老挝战场上也连连挨打，处境十分狼狈。但是，它却贼心不死，仍然在拚命进行绝望挣扎。约翰逊政府为了摆脱它在老挝战场上的困境，挽救侵越战争的败局，正加紧策划在印度支那扩大军事冒险，酝酿直接出兵和让泰国反动派增派军队侵略老挝。苏修叛徒集团同美帝国主义密切配合，加紧同老挝反动派勾结，妄想扼杀老挝人民和整个印度支那人民的革命斗争。但是，美国侵略者及其走狗的一切挣扎，只能加速它们自己的灭亡。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会最近发出庄严号召：“老挝各族人民要抓住当前的大好形势，乘胜前进，消灭敌人。”英雄的老挝人民加强战斗，坚持下去，必将取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民誓作老挝人民的坚强后盾，坚决支援老挝人民把抗美救国战争进行到底，完成民族解放的伟大事业！
