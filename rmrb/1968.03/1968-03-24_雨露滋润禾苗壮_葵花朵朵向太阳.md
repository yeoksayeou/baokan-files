The Qinghai Provincial Minhe County Grain Company organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class for children, which greatly deepened the children's boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It also cultivated the children's excellent qualities of loving the proletarian revolutionary cause, loving the collective, loving labor, cherishing public property, being united and helpful, and observing discipline.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 23rd, the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee believes that organizing half-day school students and utilizing their extracurricular time to hold study classes is a good experience in using Mao Zedong Thought to educate young children. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee is promoting this experience widely in various departments, factories, enterprises, institutions, and urban neighborhoods.

Dew and rain nourish the seedlings, sunflowers bloom towards the sun. The children of the Minhe County Grain Company organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class during their extracurricular time, which was initiated by the children's boundless love for Chairman Mao and their close following of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. One winter night last year, four primary school students—Wang Xiaoyong, Wang Xiaolin, Liu Yu, and Niu Jingjing, who are children of employees of the Minhe County Grain Company—formed a "Study Group of the Three Articles" at Wang Xiaoyong's home. Suddenly, a group of children from the same courtyard rushed in, causing a disturbance and making it impossible to study. At this moment, Wang Xiaoyong and the other four students remembered Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They said, "Chairman Mao has called for the establishment of study classes nationwide. Uncles have already started them, so why can't we start one for these children to study the 'Three Articles' and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism?"

The idea of these four students was enthusiastically supported by other children. The next day, they began preparations. However, the children did not anticipate the many difficulties they would encounter. Some parents thought that the children who disrupted others' studies were "naughty and mischievous," and that teachers and parents could not manage them, so how could they solve the problem by organizing a study class? They doubted whether the children could successfully run the study class and were not enthusiastic about supporting it. Some parents were afraid that their children would be influenced by the "naughty" children and become bad, so they did not allow their children to attend the study class. The children also had no solution for problems like the classroom. After discussion and research, the children believed that the PLA uncles would definitely support them. So, they went to find the PLA comrades who were supporting the leftist cause in the company. The PLA comrades enthusiastically supported the children's revolutionary aspirations and suggested to the revolutionary mass organizations and leading cadres of the Grain Company that they support these children in organizing the study class. The revolutionary leading group of the Grain Company, after serious discussion, sent a revolutionary worker to help the children organize the study class, provided two empty rooms for the children to use as classrooms, and helped the children build desks and benches from old bricks. The PLA comrades supporting the leftist cause and the responsible comrades of the revolutionary leading group of the company also went to the study class to give lectures to the children.

This study class had fourteen children, the oldest being fourteen and the youngest being six. They elected their own class leader, deputy class leader, and study group leader, managing and educating themselves. The portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao on the wall were put up by themselves, the slogans were written by themselves, the schedule was made by themselves, and all activities were organized by themselves. After completing their homework, the students checked each other; when encountering difficulties, they helped each other, with the older ones taking care of the younger ones and the higher grades teaching the lower grades. In the past four months, the study class has been running better and better, attracting children from the county epidemic prevention station, county bank, and other units, with the maximum number reaching twenty-four. Later, children from other units went back to organize their own study classes, but they still persisted in running the class.

The main content of this children's Mao Zedong Thought study class is the "Five Articles" and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Every day when they start studying, the first thing they say is to sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life! The first quotation from Chairman Mao they recite is "To criticize and repudiate revisionism," the first slogan they shout is "The ship sails on the vast ocean relying on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," and the first song they sing is "The East Is Red." They learn from the "Five Articles" or the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," applying what they learn immediately, combining learning with practice, and seeing immediate results. After studying every day, the children follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "serving the people" and engage in doing good deeds, establishing the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao from a young age.

Since the children started studying in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, their spiritual outlook has changed greatly. They love the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought even more. In the past, when their parents gave them pocket money, they would spend it on snacks as soon as they got it. Now, they save their pocket money bit by bit to buy portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao, respectfully pasting them on the walls of the study class. In the past, many boys had slingshots and stones in their pockets, and whenever they met, they would either quarrel or fight. Now, they have quotations from Chairman Mao in their pockets, often taking them out to read. Eleven-year-old Wang Xiaoyong has already memorized Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Five Articles" and more than a hundred quotations from Chairman Mao, as well as the preface to the second edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" written by Vice Chairman Lin.

The children participating in the study class seriously study and strive to implement every battle order issued by the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters represented by Chairman Mao. They copied Chairman Mao's important instructions during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China in their diaries, word for word, and studied them seriously. They also published wall newspapers and bulletin boards. After the heroic deeds of Li Wentong, a model of supporting the left and loving the people, were published, they immediately wrote articles for the wall newspaper, expressing their determination to learn from Li Wentong. They also quoted many articles on self-criticism and criticism of revisionism on the wall newspaper. On one side of their bulletin board, they posted poems and articles praising the great leader Chairman Mao, and on the other side, they posted articles exposing and criticizing the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev in restoring capitalism. Every day, the children in the study class are cultivating a strong sense of love and hatred of the proletariat.

Another change in the children's spiritual outlook is that their sense of loving the collective, loving labor, and cherishing public property has been greatly strengthened. In the past, some children played with slingshots and often broke the glass windows of office buildings, dormitories, or streetlights. Now, they not only no longer damage public property but also find some broken glass and repair the windows they once broke. They often volunteer to do good deeds, helping the company's cooks chop firewood, fetch water, clean out the stove, and buy vegetables. Once, Wang Xiaoyong and Hu Wenwei found a watch in the cinema and actively looked for the person who lost it, returning the watch to the owner.

In the study class, the children also cultivated the excellent qualities of unity and mutual aid, and observing organizational discipline. In the morning, the children exercise with the adults. No matter if it's windy or snowy, they insist on attending classes. In the study class, the older children take care of the younger ones, the higher-grade children teach the lower-grade children, helping and loving each other, getting along very harmoniously.

    雨露滋润禾苗壮　葵花朵朵向太阳
    青海省民和县粮食公司举办少年儿童毛泽东思想学习班，大大加深了儿童们对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限热爱；培育了儿童们热爱无产阶级革命事业、热爱集体、热爱劳动、爱护公共财物、团结互助、遵守纪律的优良品德
    据新华社西宁二十三日电　青海省民和县粮食公司举办少年儿童毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛泽东思想，开展斗私批修，大大加深了儿童们对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，培育了儿童们热爱无产阶级革命事业、热爱集体、热爱劳动、爱护公共财物、团结互助和遵守纪律的优良品德。青海省革命委员会认为，把半日制学校的学生组织起来，利用校外时间举办学习班，这是用毛泽东思想教育少年儿童的一个好经验。省革委会正在各机关、厂矿、企业、事业单位和城市街道里普遍推广。
    雨露滋润禾苗壮，葵花朵朵向太阳。民和县粮食公司少年儿童利用在校外的时间举办毛泽东思想学习班，是孩子们无限热爱毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署而创办起来的。去年冬季的一个夜晚，由民和县粮食公司职工的孩子——王晓勇、王晓林、刘羽、牛景景四个小学生组成的“老三篇”学习小组，正在王晓勇家中学习，突然同院一群孩子一哄而入，闹得无法学习。这时，王晓勇等四个小学生想起了毛主席的最新指示。他们说，毛主席不是号召全国大办学习班吗？叔叔们已经办起来了，我们为什么不可以办一个学习班，让这些小朋友都来学习“老三篇”，都来斗私批修呢！这四个小学生的主意得到了其他一些小朋友的积极支持。第二天，他们就开始筹办起来。但是，孩子们没有想到他们会遇到许多困难。有的家长认为，那些扰乱别人学习的孩子“调皮捣蛋”，老师、家长都管不了，咋能自己办学习班解决问题。他们对孩子们能不能办好学习班表示怀疑，不积极支持。个别家长怕自己的孩子受那些“调皮”孩子的影响而变坏，不让自己的孩子去学习班学习。学习班的课堂等问题，孩子们也无法解决。孩子们经过讨论、研究，认为解放军叔叔一定会支持他们。于是他们就跑去找在这个公司支左的解放军同志。解放军同志热情地支持孩子们革命化的愿望，并且向粮食公司的革命群众组织负责人和革命领导干部提出建议，支持这些孩子办学习班。粮食公司革命领导小组经过认真研究，派出一位革命工人帮助孩子们办学习班，让出两间空房子给孩子作课堂，并且帮助孩子们用烂砖头搭成桌子，垒起凳子。解放军支左人员和公司革命领导小组的负责人，还到学习班去给孩子们讲课。
    这个学习班共有十四个孩子，最大的十四岁，最小的六岁。他们自己选出班长、副班长、学习组长，自己管理自己，自己教育自己。墙上的毛主席像、毛主席语录是他们自己张贴的，标语是他们自己写的；作息时间是他们自己制订的。各种活动都是他们自己组织的。每当做完作业，同学们互相检查；遇到了困难，互相帮助，年龄大的照顾年龄小的，高年级的教低年级的。四个月来，学习班越办越好，他们把县防疫站、县银行等单位的孩子们也吸引来，最多时发展到二十四人。后来外单位的孩子回去自己办学习班了，他们仍然坚持不懈地办下去。
    这个少年儿童毛泽东思想学习班学习的主要内容是“老五篇”和《毛主席语录》。他们每天在学习班开始学习时，说的第一句话是衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！背诵的第一条毛主席语录是“要斗私，批修”，喊的第一个口号是“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”，唱的第一支歌是《东方红》。他们学习“老五篇”或《毛主席语录》，学一点就用一点，学用结合，立竿见影。每天学习结束以后，孩子们就遵照毛主席“为人民服务”的教导，开展做好事活动，使自己从小就树立起毛主席倡导的革命好学风。
    孩子们在毛泽东思想学习班学习以来，精神面貌发生了很大变化。他们更加无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想。过去，爸爸妈妈给他们的零用钱，一到手就买零食吃掉了。现在，他们把零用钱一分一分地积攒起来，买毛主席像和毛主席语录，恭恭敬敬地贴在学习班里的墙壁上。过去不少男孩子口袋里装的是弹弓、石子，相互见面，不是吵嘴，就是打架。现在，他们口袋里装的是《毛主席语录》，经常拿出来阅读。十一岁的男孩子王晓勇，已经背熟了毛主席的光辉著作“老五篇”和毛主席的一百多条语录，背会了林副主席写的《毛主席语录》再版前言。
    参加学习班的孩子们，对伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为代表的无产阶级司令部发出的每一个战斗号令，都认真学习，努力去办。他们把毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的重要指示，一笔一划地抄在日记本上，认真学习。他们还办了墙报和贴报栏。支左爱民模范李文忠同志的英雄事迹发表后，他们立即写墙报稿，表示向李文忠同志学习的决心，他们还在墙报上摘抄了很多有关斗私批修的文章。他们的贴报栏里，一边贴的是歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的诗文，一边贴的是揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义罪行的文章。孩子们在学习班里，每天都在培育着强烈的爱憎分明的无产阶级感情。
    孩子们精神面貌的另一个变化是，热爱集体、热爱劳动和爱护公共财物的观念大大加强了。过去，有些孩子玩弹弓，经常打碎机关办公室、宿舍窗子上的玻璃或路灯上的灯泡。现在，他们不仅不再破坏公共财物，而且找来一些废玻璃，把原来被他们打碎玻璃的窗户修好。他们还经常抢着做好事，帮助公司炊事员劈柴，打水，掏炉灰，买菜。一次，王晓勇和胡文伟在电影院拾到一只手表，就主动寻找丢表的人，把表交给了失主。
    孩子们在学习班里，还养成了团结友爱和遵守组织纪律等优良品德。早晨，孩子们和大人一同起床作操。不管刮风下雪，他们都坚持上课。在学习班里，大孩子照顾小孩子，高年级的孩子教低年级的孩子，互相帮助，互相爱护，相处得十分融洽。
