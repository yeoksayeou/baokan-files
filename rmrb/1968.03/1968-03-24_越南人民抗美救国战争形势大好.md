The situation in the Vietnamese People's War of Resistance Against America is excellent and getting better. The recent communiqué from the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam is proof of this. Johnson's announcement of the replacement of the U.S. commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, is another proof.

After the great victory of the Tet Offensive, the military and civilian population of South Vietnam have continued to advance, launching one strong offensive after another, continuing to strike hard at the American aggressors and their puppets. According to the communiqué from the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, the military and civilian population of South Vietnam, from the end of January to March 15, in a period of one and a half months, annihilated a total of 150,000 enemy troops, destroyed nearly 2,200 enemy aircraft, and more than 3,000 military vehicles. This brilliant victory shows that today, the power of the South Vietnamese people has never been greater, and they have further seized the initiative on the battlefield. The Vietnamese People's War of Resistance Against America is no longer a question of whether it will win or lose, nor is it a question of a big victory or a small victory; it is a definite victory. The final victory of the Vietnamese people is in sight.

The new victories in the Vietnamese People's War of Resistance Against America have further exposed the paper tiger nature of American imperialism. It has made people around the world more convinced that the seemingly powerful American imperialism is not invincible; the people of the invaded countries, as long as they use the effective weapon of people's war, can thoroughly defeat this hollow number one imperialist power.

In the face of the victory of the Tet Offensive by the military and civilian population of South Vietnam, the head of American imperialism, Johnson, still tries to feign composure, claiming that the South Vietnamese people's Tet Offensive is a "temporary act of bravery" and that it has suffered "complete failure" militarily. He has repeatedly expressed his "confidence" in the U.S. commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland. However, before long, he had to remove this defeated general from the battlefield. Johnson's change of command in the midst of the battle not only shows that the American ruling class can no longer conceal its defeat in the Vietnam War but also reflects the American ruling class's confusion in the face of the defeat.

Our great leader Chairman Mao once pointed out when talking about the inevitable failure of imperialism and reactionaries: "They are so corrupt, so full of increasingly numerous internal disputes that cannot be resolved, so despised by the people and completely isolated, and have suffered so many defeats, that they must inevitably head towards destruction." The situation of American imperialism in the Vietnam War is exactly like this.

The days of the American aggressors in South Vietnam are numbered. Precisely because their days are numbered, they will inevitably make more desperate struggles. Currently, the Johnson administration is continuously sending more troops to South Vietnam, intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam, and planning to increase the Vietnam War budget and call up reservists, scheming to expand the war to the entire Indochina. However, no matter how American imperialism expands the war, it will absolutely not be able to save itself from its complete defeat in Vietnam.

The 31 million Vietnamese people have made up their minds to fight to the end. They are responding to the call of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, to fight to the end and win, unyielding and relentless, overcoming all difficulties, and fighting bravely. The final victory will definitely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people. The American aggressors will be driven out of Vietnam, not a single one left!

    越南人民抗美救国战争形势大好
    本报评论员
    越南人民抗美救国战争形势大好，而且越来越好。越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部最近发表的公报，是一个证明。约翰逊宣布撤换侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰，又是一个证明。
    越南南方军民在新春大捷以后，乘胜前进，接连发动了一次又一次的强大攻势，继续狠狠地打击美国侵略者及其走狗。据越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部发表的公报，越南南方军民在一月末至三月十五日的一个半月中，总共歼灭敌军十五万名，击毁敌机近二千二百架、军车三千多辆。这个辉煌的战果表明，今天，越南南方人民的力量空前壮大，他们进一步掌握了战场上的主动权。越南人民的抗美救国战争，已经不是能不能胜利的问题，也不是大胜小胜的问题，而是确定无疑地要胜利。越南人民的最后胜利已经看得见了。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的新胜利，进一步戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎的面目。它使全世界人民更加确信，貌似强大的美帝国主义是不经打的；被侵略国家的人民，只要运用人民战争的有效法宝，就能够把这个外强中干的头号帝国主义彻底打败。
    在越南南方军民新春攻势的胜利面前，美帝国主义头子约翰逊还竭力假装镇静，胡说什么南越军民的新春出击是“暂时的勇敢”，在军事上遭到“完全失败”，而且一再表示对侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰的“信任”。但是，曾几何时，他不得不把越南人民的这个手下败将撤下阵来。约翰逊这种阵前易帅的做法，不仅表明美国统治集团再也无法掩饰它在侵越战争中的惨败，而且反映了美国统治集团在侵越败局面前乱了手脚。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席在谈到帝国主义和反动派必然失败的时候，曾经指出：“他们是那样腐化，那样充满日益增多的无法解决的内部争吵，那样被人民唾弃而陷于完全的孤立，打了那样多的败仗，因此他们就必不可免地走向灭亡。”美帝国主义在侵越战争中的处境正是这样。
    美国侵略者在南越的日子不长了。惟其不长，它必然还会进行更加疯狂的挣扎。目前，约翰逊政府正在陆续向南越增兵，加紧对越南北方的狂轰滥炸，并且酝酿追加大笔侵越军费和征召预备役人员，策划把战争扩大到整个印度支那。但是，不论美帝国主义怎样扩大战争，都绝对挽救不了它在越南的彻底失败。
    三千一百万越南人民已经下定了打到底的坚强决心。他们正在响应越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席决战决胜的号召，不屈不挠，再接再厉，排除万难，英勇战斗。最后的胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民。美国侵略者必将一个不剩地从越南滚出去！
