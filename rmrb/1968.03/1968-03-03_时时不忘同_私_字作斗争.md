This year, our platoon received some new recruits, and the leadership assigned me to lead them. I thought: these new recruits are all products of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with a strong revolutionary spirit. I, as their squad leader, might find it difficult to lead them, and I had some reservations about the new recruits in my mind.

Once, during an emergency assembly, the new recruit Liu Sidede was a bit slow in his actions, so I criticized him severely in front of everyone. Unexpectedly, instead of accepting the criticism humbly, he complained a lot. At that time, I thought more and more that new recruits were indeed "difficult to manage."

Later, I thought over and over again, what was the problem? Why was he not convinced, and why did I feel that new recruits were "difficult to manage"? After thinking it over, the main issue was that there was still a "selfish" element in my mind, a sense of authority, and a lack of deep class feelings for the new recruits. With this issue in mind, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings, struggled against "selfishness," and decided to go to Liu Sidede and check my own mistakes in my work methods.

That night, after I checked my shortcomings and mistakes with Liu Sidede, he coldly said, "You're just pretending to check on me. Who asked you to come and check?" After saying this, he turned and left, leaving me embarrassed. I thought: I am the squad leader, and I took the initiative to check with you, but you still treat me like this. That night, I couldn't sleep, so I turned on the light, opened the golden "Little Red Book," and repeatedly checked my thoughts against it. I realized that I hadn't completely overcome my "selfishness" and hadn't used Chairman Mao's instructions to lead the new recruits, so the soldiers didn't listen to me.

The next night, I went to find Liu Sidede again, but I didn't find him, so I returned. Unexpectedly, when I entered the room, he was sitting on his bed waiting for me. He grabbed my hand excitedly and said, "Squad leader, my attitude yesterday was very bad. After you left, I felt very uneasy, so I studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with this issue in mind. You took the initiative to talk to me, which shows that you have studied Chairman Mao's works well. I have low awareness and was blinded by 'selfishness,' disappointing Chairman Mao's kind instructions." Hearing this, tears welled up in my eyes.

From that night on, the barriers between us were removed. This incident made me realize that if you don't overcome "selfishness," you can't lead new recruits well; only by using Mao Zedong Thought to lead new recruits can you lead them well.

    时时不忘同“私”字作斗争
    今年我们连里来了一些新战士，领导上让我负责带领他们。我想：新战士都是在无产阶级文化大革命中冲杀出来的，造反精神强，自己这个班长恐怕不太好当，思想上对新战士有些“戒备”。
    一次紧急集合，新战士刘思德动作慢了一些，我就当众对他进行了严肃的批评。谁知，他不但不虚心接受批评，还发了许多牢骚。当时，我越想越认为新战士就是“不好管”。
    后来，我反复地想，问题究竟在哪里？为啥他不服气，为啥自己感到新战士“不好管”？想来想去主要是自己的头脑里还有个“私”字，有“官气”，对新战士缺乏深厚的阶级感情。我带着这个问题，反复学习毛主席的教导，狠斗“私”字，决心去向刘思德同志检查自己工作方法过于简单的错误。
    晚上，当我向刘思德检查了自己的缺点和错误之后，他很冷淡地说：“假心假意的还来哄我，谁要你来检查。”说完扭头就走了。弄得我下不了台。心想：我是班长，主动找你作检查，你还用这种态度对待我。夜里，我怎么也睡不着觉，于是打开电灯，翻开了金光闪闪的“老五篇”，反复地对照自己的思想进行检查，原来自己的“私”字还没有完全斗倒，没有用毛主席的指示去带新兵，所以战士听不进去。
    第二天晚上，我又去找刘思德，没有找到，我就回来了。出乎意料的是，我一进屋，他正坐在床铺上等着我呢。他一把抓住我的手激动地说：“班长，我昨天的态度很不好。你走了以后，我心里很不安，就带着这个问题，学习了毛主席的最新指示。你主动找我谈心，是你毛主席著作学得好。我觉悟低，叫‘私’字迷住了心窍，对不起毛主席他老人家的亲切教导。”听他这么一说，我的热泪夺眶而出。
    从那天晚上起，我们俩之间的隔阂消除了。这件事使我体会到：“私”字斗不倒，新兵带不好；只有用毛泽东思想去带新兵，才能带好。
