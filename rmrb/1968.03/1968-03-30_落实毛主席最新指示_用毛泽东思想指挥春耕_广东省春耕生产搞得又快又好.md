The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of Guangdong Province are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have launched a high tide of spring plowing production. At present, spring sowing and planting work in most parts of the province is nearing completion, and early rice transplanting is being carried out on a full scale. In the relatively early season of Hainan Island, early rice transplanting has been completed by about 70 percent.

The most distinctive feature of Guangdong's spring plowing production this year is the prominent emphasis on class struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide production and direct spring plowing. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres say: "No matter how busy we are, we must not forget to study Mao Zedong Thought; no matter how difficult it is, with Mao Zedong Thought we can overcome it." All over the province, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," and in accordance with the characteristics of the busy spring plowing season, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are being held extensively, at all levels, in all production teams, in the fields during work, and in the evenings after work. The masses and cadres, with the slogan "criticize and repudiate revisionism and struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism," are studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions extensively and using them extensively, studying and using the "Three Articles" extensively, recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, criticizing and repudiating revisionism and selfishness, eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit. This has made the spring plowing production front a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Through study, the masses' consciousness has been greatly raised, revolutionary enthusiasm has been greatly aroused, and the pace of spring plowing production has been accelerated. In many communes and production teams in Zhongshan County, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held, linking spring plowing production with actual conditions, pinpointing the living thoughts of cadres and masses, criticizing and repudiating revisionism and selfishness, and removing various ideological obstacles to spring plowing production, thus launching a high tide of spring plowing production. All items of work such as fertilizer accumulation and transportation, plowing and harrowing, sowing and seedling raising, and early rice transplanting have been carried out faster and better than last year.

The broad masses of grass-roots cadres in the rural areas are the backbone of production, and promoting the thought revolutionization of cadres is the key to doing a good job of spring plowing production at present. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various places all take helping cadres to achieve thought revolutionization as an important task, insisting on using Mao Zedong Thought to educate cadres, and promoting cadres to eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, correctly treat the masses, correctly treat themselves, put down their burdens, start their machines, and bravely go to the front line of revolution and production, striving to do new deeds for the people. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically help cadres to correct their mistakes and actively support cadres in leading spring plowing production. In many places, a new situation of members supporting cadres, cadres caring for members, uniting as one, and making a great fuss over spring plowing production has emerged.

In the spring plowing production, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have further carried out a thorough criticism and repudiation of revisionism, closely linking it with local actual conditions, and severely criticizing the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, eliminating the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been more deeply rooted in people's hearts, the socialist position in the rural areas has been more consolidated, and the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants has been more aroused. In many places, the members, taking Dazhai as an example, rely on their own efforts, strive hard, build canals and dams, open up wasteland and create fields, improve irrigation and drainage conditions, and strive to develop the collective economy. The members of Hongwei Production Team, Baijin Brigade, Baiyin Commune, Enping County, after studying Chairman Mao's instruction that "only socialism can save China," severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crime of attempting to restore capitalism, aroused revolutionary enthusiasm, and in two days accumulated more than 20,000 piculs of soil and miscellaneous fertilizer, opened up more than 20 acres of wasteland, planted more than 15,000 cassava trees, and more than 15,000 bamboo seedlings.

    落实毛主席最新指示　用毛泽东思想指挥春耕
    广东省春耕生产搞得又快又好
    新华社广州二十七日电　广东省农村广大贫下中农和革命干部坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，掀起春耕生产高潮。现在全省大部分地区的春种春播工作已接近结束，早稻插秧正全面展开。季节较早的海南岛，早稻插秧已经完成七成左右。
    广东今年春耕生产的最大特点是大力突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，指挥春耕。广大贫下中农和革命干部说：“千忙万忙，学习毛泽东思想不能忘；千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难。”全省各地遵照毛主席关于“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，根据春耕大忙的特点，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，层层办，队队办，上工田间办，收工夜间办，广大群众、干部，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大学大用毛主席的最新指示，大学大用“老三篇”，忆苦思甜，斗私批修，破私立公，使春耕生产第一线成为活学活用毛主席最新指示的大课堂，成为斗私批修的战场。通过学习，群众觉悟大提高，革命干劲大发扬，加快了春耕生产的进程。中山县许多社队举办的毛泽东思想学习班，联系春耕生产实际，针对干部群众中的活思想，斗私批修，扫除春耕生产中的各种思想障碍，掀起了春耕生产高潮。全县积肥送肥、犁田耙田、播种育秧、早稻插秧等各项工作都比去年进行得又快又好。
    农村广大基层干部是生产的骨干，促进干部的思想革命化是当前搞好春耕生产的关键。各地举办的毛泽东思想学习班，都把帮助干部实现思想革命化作为一项重要任务，坚持用毛泽东思想教育干部，促使干部破私立公，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，放下包袱，开动机器，勇敢地走上革命、生产第一线，努力为人民立新功。广大贫下中农热情地帮助干部改正错误，积极支持干部领导春耕生产。许多地方出现了社员支持干部，干部关心社员，团结一致，大闹春耕生产的新局面。
    在春耕生产中，各地广大贫下中农和革命干部以毛泽东思想为武器，进一步开展革命大批判，密切结合当地实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论，肃清反革命修正主义路线的流毒。战无不胜的毛泽东思想更加深入人心，农村社会主义阵地更加巩固，广大贫下中农的社会主义积极性更加高涨。许多地方的社员以大寨为榜样，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，修渠筑坝，开荒造田，改善排灌条件，努力发展集体经济。恩平县横陂公社白银大队红卫生产队社员学习了毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，鼓起革命干劲，两天内便积土杂肥二万多担，开荒二十多亩，栽种木薯一万五千多棵，竹苗一万五千多株。
