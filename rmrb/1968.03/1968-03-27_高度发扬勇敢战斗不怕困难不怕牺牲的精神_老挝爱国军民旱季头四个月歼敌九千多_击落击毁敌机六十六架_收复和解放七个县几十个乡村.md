The Laotian patriotic military and civilians, in the first four months of the dry season, annihilated over nine thousand enemy troops, shot down and destroyed sixty-six enemy aircraft, and liberated seven counties and dozens of townships and villages.

KANGO, March 27 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the Laotian People's Liberation Army General Command issued a communiqué on March 12, detailing the achievements of the Laotian patriotic military and civilians in the first four months of the 1967-1968 dry season. The communiqué highly praises the bravery of the Laotian patriotic military and civilians on all battlefields across the country, achieving tremendous victories, and calls on them to press forward and achieve even greater victories.

The communiqué states that from November 1967 to February 1968, the Laotian People's Liberation Armed Forces, Patriotic Neutralist Armed Forces, and patriotic compatriots of all ethnic groups across the country continuously and proactively engaged in over four hundred large and small battles. They annihilated and dismantled over nine thousand enemy troops, including completely annihilating eight enemy battalions and eleven companies, severely damaging four regiments and twenty-one battalions, and eliminating two regimental command posts and eight battalion command posts. They also seized over two thousand four hundred pieces of various weapons, shot down and destroyed sixty-six enemy aircraft, sank fourteen motorboats and patrol boats, and captured a large amount of ammunition and combat equipment. The People's Liberation Armed Forces also liberated and freed seven counties, nearly twenty townships, and dozens of villages, liberating tens of thousands of people.

The communiqué notes that the number of enemy troops annihilated in the first four months of the 1967-1968 dry season was three thousand four hundred ninety more than the number annihilated in the seven months of the 1966-1967 dry season. The number of enemy troops captured, surrendered, or deserted increased by five times.

The communiqué points out that the aforementioned victories prove that the Laotian patriotic military and civilians have sufficient strength to defeat American imperialism and its lackeys. This great victory, along with the recent brilliant victories achieved by the military and civilians in South Vietnam, further pushes American imperialism and its lackeys into a passive, desperate, and hopeless situation.

The communiqué concludes by calling on the Laotian patriotic military and civilians to further strengthen their resolve to defeat American imperialism and its lackeys under any circumstances, to bravely advance, to highly embody the spirit of brave combat, fearlessness of hardships and sacrifices, to enhance unity between the military and civilians, and between the Liberation Armed Forces and the Patriotic Neutralist Armed Forces, and to achieve even greater victories.

    新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝人民解放军最高指挥部三月十二日发表了老挝爱国军民一九六七——一九六八年旱季头四个月的战绩公报。公报热烈表扬老挝爱国军民在全国各个战场上勇猛杀敌，取得了巨大战果，并且号召老挝爱国军民乘胜前进，夺取更大的胜利。
    公报说，在一九六七年十一月到一九六八年二月的旱季头四个月中，老挝人民解放武装力量、爱国中立武装力量和全国各族爱国同胞连续和主动地进行大小规模战斗四百多次，歼灭和瓦解敌人九千多名，其中包括全歼敌军八个营、十一个连，重创四个团、二十一个营，歼灭团指挥部两个、营指挥部八个；缴获各种武器二千四百多件，击落击毁敌机六十六架，击沉汽艇和机动艇十四艘，缴获大批弹药和作战工具。人民解放武装力量还收复和解放七个县、近二十个乡和数十个村，使成万人民获得了解放。
