In the newly formed revolutionary committees, it is crucial for new and old revolutionary cadres to learn from each other and strengthen unity. This is a very important issue in promoting the thought revolutionization of the leading cadre and consolidating the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "New and old cadres should respect each other, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, so as to unite as one and engage in a common cause, and prevent the tendency of sectarianism."

Whether they are old cadres or new cadres, they all have their strengths and weaknesses. One must correctly treat oneself and correctly treat others. If one holds prejudices of bourgeoisie, petty-bourgeoisie sectarianism, and individualism, only seeing one's own strengths and not seeing others' strengths, only demanding that others respect oneself but not respecting others, it will inevitably hinder unity and hinder work, and is not conducive to consolidating the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

The new and old revolutionary cadres participating in the revolutionary committees are all cadres taught and trained by Chairman Mao, all servants of the people. They should take the party principles of the proletariat as their code of conduct; regard the revolutionary interests of the proletariat as their highest interests. In executing the common combat mission of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they should care for each other, love each other, learn from each other, and help each other.

Within the revolutionary committees, democratic centralism should be practiced, and democratic life should be strengthened. If there are differing opinions, they should be discussed openly, and problems should be placed on the table. According to the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, issues should be resolved through criticism and self-criticism. One should not gossip behind others' backs or engage in liberalism.

The experiences of the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Municipal Transport Company Revolutionary Committee in correctly handling the relationship between new and old cadres are very good. The new and old cadres of revolutionary committees at all levels should, like them, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, unite as one, work closely together, and make the revolutionary committees truly become a vigorous, energetic, and authoritative leading core and combat collective with proletarian revolutionary authority.

    新老干部要互相学习
    本报评论员
    在新生的革命委员会里，新老革命干部互相学习，加强团结，这是促进领导班子思想革命化，巩固革命三结合的一个很重要的问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业，而防止宗派主义的倾向。”
    无论是老干部还是新干部，都有自己的长处，也有自己的弱点。一定要正确地对待自己，正确地对待别人。如果抱着资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和个人主义的偏见，只看到自己的长处，看不到别人的长处，只要求别人尊重自己，自己却不尊重别人，那就势必妨碍团结，妨碍工作，不利于巩固革命的三结合。
    参加革命委员会的新老革命干部，都是毛主席教导和培养的干部，都是人民的勤务员。他们应当把无产阶级的党性原则，作为自己的行动准则；把无产阶级的革命利益，看作自己的最高利益。他们在执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的共同战斗任务中，应当互相关心，互相爱护，互相学习，互相帮助。
    在革命委员会内部，要实行民主集中制，健全民主生活。彼此有意见，要当面说，把问题摆在桌面上，按照毛泽东思想的原则，通过批评和自我批评加以解决，决不要在背后议论，搞自由主义。
    广州市革命委员会和北京市运输公司革命委员会正确处理新老干部关系的经验，都是很好的。各级革命委员会的新老干部，应该象他们那样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，团结一致，亲密合作，使革命委员会真正成为一个富有生命力的、朝气蓬勃的、具有无产阶级革命权威的领导核心和战斗集体。
