The Battlefield of Revolutionary Criticism is Set Up in the Fields of Zheyanpo Brigade

The Zheyanpo Brigade of Dalu Commune in Qionghai County, Hainan Island, has been deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism, which has effectively promoted the thought revolutionization and spring plowing production of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have an even more ardent loyalty to Chairman Mao, a higher awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and an increasingly good revolutionary and production situation.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Zheyanpo Brigade have always insisted on carrying out revolutionary criticism. They set up revolutionary criticism battlefields in the fields, on the roadsides, in the homes, and in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They thoroughly expose and criticize the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism and resolutely eliminate the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. No matter how busy the farm work is or how tight the time is, they insist on using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism for three evenings a week. The poor and lower-middle peasants, in carrying out revolutionary criticism, study one revolutionary viewpoint of Chairman Mao each time, criticize one counter-revolutionary fallacy of China's Khrushchev, and eliminate the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in one aspect of their unit. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants often recall the bitterness of the old society and compare it with the sweetness of the new society. With profound proletarian feelings, they praise the greatness and correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry out the "three loyalties" activity of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Revolutionary criticism has made the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres understand Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle" more deeply, see the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside more clearly, and hate China's Khrushchev more deeply. They say: We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, grasp class struggle, talk about it year after year, month after month, and day after day, and use the viewpoint of class struggle and line struggle to analyze and deal with everything, thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, including their agents in Guangdong, and eliminate all their poisonous influences.

In the process of revolutionary criticism, the Zheyanpo Brigade also focused on criticizing China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small number" in the cadre issue, raising the awareness of cadres and community members, strengthening the unity between cadres and community members, and making Chairman Mao's cadre policy more deeply rooted in people's hearts. Originally, some cadres who wanted to shirk responsibility and were afraid to take on heavy burdens bravely stood up to revolution. They said: All hatred should be concentrated on China's Khrushchev. They expressed their determination to unite with the broad revolutionary masses, raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Each production team further established and improved the revolutionary production leadership cadre, and vigorously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Revolutionary criticism has inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses and cadres. They vigorously emphasize proletarian politics, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide production, and have launched a spring plowing production upsurge. The entire brigade has carried out a mass movement to follow the Dazhai path, learn from the Dazhai people, and promote the Dazhai spirit. This year, the entire brigade's early rice planting area has expanded by 1,900 mu compared to last year, with strong and robust seedlings, presenting a prosperous scene.

    新华社广州二十八日电　海南岛琼海县大路公社蔗园坡大队深入持久地开展革命大批判，有力地促进了人的思想革命化和春耕生产。贫下中农和革命干部无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心越来越红，阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟越来越高，革命、生产形势越来越好。
    蔗园坡大队的贫下中农和革命干部，一直坚持开展革命大批判。他们在田头、地边、家庭和毛泽东思想学习班，处处摆下革命大批判的战场，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，坚决肃清反革命修正主义路线的流毒。不论农活怎样忙，时间怎样紧，他们都坚持以毛泽东思想为武器，每周用三个晚上开展革命大批判。贫下中农在开展革命大批判中，每次学习毛主席一个革命观点，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反革命谬论，肃清反革命修正主义路线在本单位一个方面的流毒。广大贫下中农还经常忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜。他们怀着无比深厚的无产阶级感情，颂扬伟大领袖毛主席、伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无比伟大、正确，开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动。
    革命大批判，使广大贫下中农和革命干部，对毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，理解得越来越深刻，对农村中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，看得越来越清楚；对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨越来越深。他们说：我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，狠抓阶级斗争，年年讲，月月讲，天天讲，做到用阶级斗争的观点，用路线斗争的观点，分析一切，对待一切，彻底批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在广东的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，肃清其一切流毒。
    蔗园坡大队在革命大批判中，还重点批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，提高了干部、社员的觉悟，增强了干部和社员的团结，毛主席的干部政策更加深入人心。原来一些想撂挑子、怕担重担的干部勇敢地站出来革命。他们说：千仇万恨，要集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上。他们表示要和广大革命群众一条心、一股劲，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。各生产队都进一步建立和健全了革命生产领导班子，大力落实毛主席的最新指示。
    革命大批判激发了广大群众、干部的革命干劲，他们大力突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，掀起了春耕生产高潮。全大队开展了走大寨路，学大寨人，兴大寨风的群众运动。今年全大队早稻种植面积比去年扩大了一千九百亩，苗强苗壮，一片兴旺景象。
