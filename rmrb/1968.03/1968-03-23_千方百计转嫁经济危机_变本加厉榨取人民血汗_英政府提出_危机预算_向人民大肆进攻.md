The British Labour government on March 19 presented a "crisis budget" to the House of Commons, which was filled with an atmosphere of anxiety and unease. The budget aims to ruthlessly exploit the British people to plug the holes in Britain's ailing fiscal and economic ship, in a vain attempt to prevent it from being swallowed by the turbulent waves of the capitalist world's financial crisis.

This is the first budget since the devaluation of the pound in November last year. A wave of gold buying, intensifying with each passing day, finally triggered the capitalist world's financial crisis on the eve of the new British budget. The entire Western monetary and financial system is now in the process of collapsing. Under these circumstances, Britain's weak fiscal and economic situation has been dealt a heavy blow. The pound's position is once again in jeopardy, and rumors of a second devaluation are rife. To cope with the emergency, the British government had to increase its standby credit from the International Monetary Fund from $1.4 billion to $4 billion following the devaluation of the pound. It is under this dire situation that the Labour government has proposed a new budget to further squeeze the working people.

British Chancellor of the Exchequer Roy Jenkins, in presenting the budget and subsequent television speech, stated that the purpose of this budget is to prevent Britain from "rapidly sliding back into the kind of economic crisis we have suffered at least eight times since the end of the Second World War." The means to achieve this goal, he said, is to ruthlessly cut into the British people. He said that the British people must make "arduous sacrifices" over the next two years.

One of these "sacrifices" is to force people to pay more taxes from their already meager pockets—an increase of £923 million in taxes over the year, which is three times the highest tax increase in any non-war period in British history and even harsher than the tax increases during the Second World War.

Local journalists believe that to shift the heavy tax burden onto the broad masses of people, capitalists will inevitably raise the prices of goods, further driving up the already soaring prices since the devaluation of the pound.

At the same time that prices are bound to skyrocket, the wages of the broad laboring masses will not be allowed to increase. Jenkins said in the House of Commons that the government would seek parliamentary authority to suspend workers' wage increase demands for up to a year at any time within the next eighteen months.

Jenkins also stated in his budget speech and television address that the Labour government intends to sacrifice the people to help monopolistic capitalists enhance the competitiveness of British goods in foreign markets, thereby helping Britain to escape the international payments crisis, improve the pound's position, and contribute to delaying the collapse of the entire capitalist monetary and financial system. However, even some British bourgeois elements believe that this hope is difficult to realize. They are concerned that the new budget will greatly reduce the purchasing power of the British people, leading to further contraction of the domestic market. The foreign market will inevitably be affected by the capitalist world's financial crisis, with more difficulties and risks, and capitalist world trade activities will "slow down." In this way, the Labour government's calculations will completely fall through.

    千方百计转嫁经济危机　变本加厉榨取人民血汗
    英政府提出“危机预算”向人民大肆进攻
    据新华社伦敦二十日电　英国工党政府十九日在充满焦虑不安气氛的议会下院中，提出了一项“危机预算”，决定变本加厉地榨取英国人民的血汗，去堵塞英国财政经济这条破船的漏洞，妄图使它不致被资本主义世界金融危机的惊涛骇浪所吞没。
    这是工党政府在去年十一月英镑贬值后提出来的第一个预算。英镑贬值后，一阵紧似一阵的黄金抢购风潮，终于在英国新预算出笼的前夕触发了资本主义世界的金融危机，整个西方货币金融体系正在加速垮台。在这种情况下，英国虚弱的财政经济又受到了十分沉重的打击，英镑地位再次告急，第二次贬值的风声盛极一时。为了应急，英国政府不得不把它在英镑贬值后向“国际货币基金”组织借贷的“备用信贷”从十四亿美元提高到四十亿美元。正是在这种危急的局势下，工党政府提出了向劳动人民进一步开刀的新预算。
    英国财政大臣詹金斯在提出预算时以及随后在电视讲话中表示，这个预算的目的，是要使英国避免“迅速地再次滑到（第二次世界）大战结束以来我们至少遭过八次的那种经济危机当中去”。而达到目的的办法，就是恶狠狠地向英国人民进行砍杀。他说，英国人民必须在今后两年中作出“艰苦牺牲”。
    这些“牺牲”之一，就是迫使人民从干瘪的腰包中掏出更多的税款——一年中增税九亿二千三百万英镑，等于过去英国任何非战争时期的预算所规定的最高增税幅度的三倍，甚至比第二次世界大战时预算所规定的增税幅度还厉害。
    这里的报界人士认为，为了把沉重的赋税负担转嫁给广大人民，资本家势必大大提高商品价格，从而使英镑贬值以来急剧上升的物价进一步扶摇直上。
    在物价必然猛涨的同时，广大劳动群众的工资却不得增加。詹金斯在下院表示，政府将要求议会授予权力，以便在十八个月内随时可以把工人关于增加工资的要求搁置一年。
    詹金斯在提出预算时以及在电视讲话中还表示，工党政府企图通过牺牲人民来帮助垄断资本家增强英国商品在外国市场的竞争能力，从而使英国摆脱国际支付危机，改善英镑地位，进而为延缓整个资本主义货币金融体系的垮台作出“贡献”。但是，连一些英国资产阶级人士都认为，这种希望难以实现。他们担心，新预算大量压缩英国人民的购买力，这将导致国内市场的进一步萎缩，而国外市场又势必受到资本主义世界金融危机的影响，困难和风险更多，资本主义世界的国际贸易活动势将“放慢”，这样一来，工党政府的如意算盘就将完全落空。
