Qingdao No. 8 Middle School has established a new style of revolutionary thrift. The Revolutionary Committee of Qingdao No. 8 Middle School in Qingdao City has earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's great directive to "further economize and make revolution." Starting from ideological education, they have vigorously promoted political and ideological education on economizing and making revolution, gradually fostering a good tradition among the broad revolutionary teachers and students: "Thrift is glorious, waste is shameful."

After the Revolutionary Committee was established in April last year, there was once a period when waste was relatively serious. Some members of the Revolutionary Committee also showed signs of extravagance, ostentation, and flaunting wealth. The stationed PLA soldiers, in response to these problems, first organized the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the Red Guards Committee to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on "further economizing and making revolution," overcoming the "young master" tendency of extravagance and waste.

Over the past year, the school's Revolutionary Committee has consistently adhered to the principle of economizing and making revolution. They have focused on both major and minor aspects, carefully planning and saving for the revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, although the demand for paper, ink, glue, electricity, and other supplies suddenly increased, the expenditure of various funds across the school still decreased by 20% compared to the original plan.

In the process of economizing and making revolution, the school's Revolutionary Committee has paid special attention to fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of logistical and financial personnel. The kitchen workers noticed that there were unburned coal pieces in the ashes, so they persisted in sifting through them every day despite the hard work, mixing the unburned coal pieces with good coal to burn. They also improved the stoves, saving nearly ten tons of coal in one year. The logistical and financial personnel insisted on principles, refusing to pay for any unreasonable expenses and not issuing any materials that did not comply with regulations. They also formulated specific measures for financial expenditures and material management and use based on national policies and the school's specific situation, ensuring the implementation of various economizing measures from an institutional perspective.

　　青岛第八中学树立勤俭节约革命新风尚
    青岛市第八中学革命委员会认真贯彻执行毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，从思想教育入手，大抓狠抓节约闹革命的政治思想教育，使广大革命师生逐渐树立了“节约光荣，浪费可耻”的好风尚。
    青岛八中在去年四月成立了革命委员会后，一度浪费现象比较严重，有些革委会成员也有大手大脚、讲排场、摆阔气的苗头。驻校解放军同志针对这些问题，首先组织革命委员会和红卫兵委员会成员认真学习毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”等有关教导，克服铺张浪费的“大少爷”作风。
    近一年来，校革委会始终坚持了节约闹革命的原则。从大处着眼、小处着手，精打细算，为革命节约。在文化大革命中，虽然纸张、墨水、浆糊、水电等需要量骤然增加，但全校各种经费的开支却比原计划下降了百分之二十。
    在节约闹革命中，校革委会特别注意充分发挥后勤人员、财务人员的积极性和创造性。伙房炊事员看到炉灰里还有未烧透的煤渣，就不顾劳累，坚持天天筛拣，把未烧透的煤渣掺在好煤里烧；并且改造了炉灶，一年来共节约煤炭近十吨。后勤、财务人员注意坚持原则，不管什么人，不合理的开支一律不付，不符合规定的物资一律不发。他们还根据国家的有关政策和本校的具体情况，制定了一些有关财务开支和物资保管使用的具体办法，从制度上保证了各项节约措施的落实。
