The military training team stationed at Zhangjiakou No. 3 Middle School in Hebei Province has, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on trusting and relying on the masses, mobilized revolutionary parents and the masses to help teachers and students overcome factionalism and resume classes to make revolution. They have achieved good results. They have gone into the homes of the vast majority of teachers and students, repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's instructions on revolutionary great alliance and resuming classes to make revolution, and done painstaking ideological and political work. They have mobilized social forces to help revolutionary teachers and students with their ideological revolutionization, rooted out bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, developed and consolidated the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The attendance rate of students has reached ninety-five percent.

The 1,400 teachers and students of this school had participated in two revolutionary mass organizations. As the struggle between the two factions in this area intensified, the two factions of teachers and students in this school often had friction, and the antagonistic sentiments were very serious. Some students did not go to school for a long time. This situation seriously affected the realization of the revolutionary great alliance, the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and the smooth progress of resuming classes to make revolution.

The comrades of the military training team analyzed this situation and believed that to solve this problem, on the one hand, it is necessary to rely on the revolutionary teachers and students to fight against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and on the other hand, it is necessary to mobilize revolutionary parents to promote the ideological revolutionization of teachers and students and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Therefore, the comrades of the military training team, together with some teachers and students, went from door to door to visit the homes of revolutionary teachers and students and propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

They first conducted investigations and learned about the situation of the parents. Most of the students in this school are children of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary workers. Each family has a history of suffering and a debt of blood and tears. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary workers have an extremely deep class feeling for Chairman Mao, and a deep hatred for the old society and Chinese Khrushchev. They listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. But the revolutionary teachers and students, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "Many young people, due to lack of political experience and social life experience, are not good at comparing old China with new China, and it is not easy for them to deeply understand that our people have gone through thousands of hardships and struggles to get rid of the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries." Therefore, by conducting class education for them, arousing their deep class feelings of unlimited love, loyalty, belief, and admiration for Chairman Mao, they can achieve "Chairman Mao instructs me to do it, Chairman Mao waves his hand and I move forward!" Therefore, the military training team, together with revolutionary parents and revolutionary teachers and students, held family remembrance meetings, spoke at length about the suffering of class oppression and exploitation in the old society, denounced the heinous crimes of Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism, and studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary great alliance and resuming classes to make revolution. Many parents, with tears streaming down their faces, excitedly shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" and expressed to the comrades of the military training team that they would definitely educate and help their children to strengthen proletarian party spirit, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, achieve revolutionary great alliance, and do well in resuming classes to make revolution.

Qifengjiao, a student in Class One of the second year, was a key member of one factional organization. Due to being deeply deceived by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, she found various excuses to obstruct the revolutionary great alliance. The comrades of the military training team learned that her family background was very bitter, so they visited her home, held a remembrance meeting together, and studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "Who are our enemies and who are our friends." Her mother, with tears in her eyes, recalled the tragic family history of begging for food, being beaten, and scolded since she was young. Her sister exposed the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary line in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Her aunt said, "In our family, generation after generation, only you have the opportunity to study. Without Chairman Mao, could there be today? Not listening to Chairman Mao's words is ungrateful!" This gave Qifengjiao a great education. She said with tears, "In the past, I was blinded by factionalism, treating class sisters as enemies, interfering with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, which is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. In the future, I will definitely remember the class suffering and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life." Qifengjiao returned to school and actively promoted the revolutionary great alliance in her class and actively prepared for resuming classes to make revolution.

There were also some parents who, due to being deeply poisoned by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, participated in the same factional organization in society with their children, influencing each other, and having strong factionalism. For such families, the comrades of the military training team, during their visits, spoke to them about the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, talked about the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, helped the whole family to study the "Old Five Articles," strengthened proletarian party spirit, and overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Xue Ehuo, a student in Class Two of the second year, had his whole family participate in the same factional organization. The comrades of the military training team visited his home six times. The brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought finally illuminated their hearts and dispelled the fog of factionalism. Xue Ehuo's father not only thanked the army for their help and education but also actively educated his children to return to school and do well in resuming classes to make revolution.

Through painstaking ideological and political work, the military training team made revolutionary parents care about and support the school in resuming classes to make revolution, and ensured that things unfavorable to resuming classes to make revolution were managed, and things unfavorable to the revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination were stopped.

The comrades of the military training team also adopted the method of inviting in, inviting old workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and old Red Army soldiers to the school to speak from their personal experiences, educating the younger generation. This also played a great role in helping teachers and students to achieve revolutionary great alliance and do well in resuming classes to make revolution.

Because revolutionary parents and the masses were mobilized to support the school in resuming classes to make revolution, many parents, seeing that their children had not gone to school for a long time, used their own painful experiences in the old society to educate their children, making them listen to Chairman Mao's words and resume classes to make revolution; some parents even personally sent their children to school. At present, this middle school has achieved revolutionary great alliance, liberated all revolutionary cadres, established a revolutionary committee, and is vigorously carrying out the resumption of classes to make revolution. Some students who were originally opposed to each other have now formed teaching reform groups, jointly criticizing the revisionist educational line. A high tide of education revolution and struggle, criticism, and transformation in this unit is surging in No. 3 Middle School.

    张家口三中军训团把毛主席最新指示送到革命家长的心坎里
    发动革命家长帮助师生克服派性复课闹革命
    本报讯　驻河北省张家口市第三中学军训团遵照毛主席关于相信群众，依靠群众的教导，发动革命家长、革命群众帮助师生复课闹革命，取得了很好的效果。他们深入到绝大部分师生的家庭里，反复宣传毛主席关于革命大联合和复课闹革命的指示，做艰苦细致的思想政治工作，发动社会力量帮助革命师生搞好思想革命化，铲除了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，发展和巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，学生到课率已达百分之九十五。
    这个学校的一千四百名师生，曾经分别参加了两派革命群众组织。随着本地区两大派斗争的尖锐化，这个学校的两派师生也经常发生磨擦，对立情绪非常严重。部分同学长期不到学校。这种情况，严重地影响了革命大联合、革命三结合的实现和复课闹革命的顺利进行。
    军训团的同志对这种情况进行了分析，并且认为：要解决这个问题，一方面要依靠学校的革命师生狠斗资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，同时也需要发动革命家长促进师生思想革命化，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。因此，军训团的同志便和部分师生一起，逐门逐户地访问革命师生的家庭，宣传毛主席的最新指示。
    他们首先通过调查研究，摸清了家长的情况。这个学校的学生大部分是贫下中农、革命工人的子女。他们每家都有一部苦难史，一笔血泪仇。贫下中农和革命工人对毛主席有无比深厚的阶级感情，对旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫有刻骨的仇恨，他们最听毛主席的话。而革命师生，正象毛主席所指出的：“不少青年人由于缺少政治经验和社会生活经验，不善于把旧中国和新中国加以比较，不容易深切了解我国人民曾经怎样经历千辛万苦的斗争才摆脱了帝国主义和国民党反动派的压迫”。因此，对他们进行阶级教育，激发起他们对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的深厚阶级感情，就能够做到“毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进！”于是，军训团同革命家长、革命师生一起召开家庭忆苦会，大讲大忆旧社会阶级压迫和阶级剥削苦，大批中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，大学毛主席关于革命大联合、复课闹革命的最新指示。不少家长泪流满面激动地高呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”并且向军训团的同志表示，一定教育和帮助自己的子女增强无产阶级党性，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，实现革命大联合，搞好复课闹革命。
    高二一班齐凤娟同学是一派群众组织的主要成员，由于受资产阶级、小资产阶级派性蒙蔽较深，就找各种借口阻碍革命大联合。军训团的同志了解到她家庭出身很苦，便到她家访问，在一起开了忆苦会，学习了毛主席关于“谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友”的教导。她的母亲含着眼泪回忆了从小要饭挨打受骂的悲惨家史。她的姐姐揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫在文化大革命中推行资产阶级反动路线的罪行。她婶婶说：“咱们家祖祖辈辈就出了你这么个念书的，没有毛主席能有今天吗？你不听毛主席的话就是忘本啊！”这使齐凤娟受到了很大教育。她流着眼泪说：“过去我被派性蒙住了眼，把阶级姊妹当成敌人，干扰了毛主席的伟大战略部署，这是对毛主席他老人家最大的不忠。今后我一定要牢记阶级苦，紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。”齐凤娟到校后，积极促进班级的革命大联合，积极筹备复课闹革命。
    也有些家长由于受资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的毒害较深，又和自己的子女参加了社会上同一派组织，互相影响，派性很强。对于这样的家庭，军训团的同志在访问时就向他们大讲毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，大谈无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，帮助全家大学“老五篇”，增强无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。高二二班薛霭和同学全家参加了同一派组织，军训团的同志先后六次登门访问，伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉终于照亮了他们的心，驱散了派性的迷雾。薛霭和的父亲不仅感谢解放军的帮助和教育，还主动教育自己的孩子回校搞好复课闹革命。
    军训团通过艰苦细致的思想政治工作，使革命家长更进一步关心和支持学校复课闹革命，做到了不利于复课闹革命的事有人管，不利于革命大联合、三结合的事有人制止。
    军训团的同志们还采取请进来的方法，把苦大仇深的老工人、贫下中农、老红军请到学校现身说法，教育年青一代，这对于帮助师生实现革命大联合、搞好复课闹革命，也起了很大的作用。
    由于发动了革命家长、革命群众支持学校复课闹革命，有许多家长看到自己孩子有较长一段时间没去学校，就用自己在旧社会的痛苦经历教育孩子，让孩子听毛主席的话，复课闹革命；有的家长还把自己孩子亲自送到学校。目前，这所中学已实现了革命大联合，解放了所有的革命干部，建立了革命委员会，复课闹革命搞得有声有色。原来对立的一些同学，现在组成了教改小组，共同批判修正主义教育路线。一个大闹教育革命和本单位斗、批、改的高潮正在三中蓬勃开展。（郑继胜、王自正、龚贵）
