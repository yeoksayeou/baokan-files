Approximately 2,500 students from universities across Britain gathered in Trafalgar Square, London, on March 3 to protest against the Wilson government's policy of asking students to tighten their belts. British students are currently engaged in a movement against the decline in their living standards due to rising prices. This gathering was the first nationwide action of this movement. After the rally, many students marched through Downing Street, where the Prime Minister's office is located, chanting slogans such as: "Wilson, get out, get out, get out!" and "Gordon-Walker (British Minister of Education), get out!"

    英国大学生抗议政府要学生勒紧腰带
    来自英国全国各大学的大约二千五百名学生，三日在伦敦特拉法加广场集会，抗议威尔逊政府要学生勒紧腰带的政策。英国的大学生正在开展一个运动，反对因物价上涨而使他们的生活水平下降。这次集会就是这个运动中的第一次全国性行动。集会结束后，有许多学生列队穿过首相府所在的唐宁街，沿途高呼口号：“威尔逊滚蛋，滚蛋，滚蛋！”“戈登—沃克（英国教育大臣）滚蛋！”
