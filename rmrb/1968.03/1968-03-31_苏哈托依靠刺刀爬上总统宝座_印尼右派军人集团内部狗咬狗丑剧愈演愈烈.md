The running dog of American imperialism and the head of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Suharto, on the 27th employed military means to climb from the position of acting president to the presidency. The Indonesian right-wing military clique, with blood on their hands from the Indonesian Communist Party and revolutionary people, will further slide down the road of fascism, anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-China.

The puppet of the Indonesian fascist military regime, the highest legislative body, the "Provisional People's Consultative Assembly," under Suharto's orders, on March 21st in Jakarta struck the gong for this power struggle farce. After intense bargaining and heated arguments among the right-wing parties, on the 27th, they passed the decision for Suharto to serve as president for five years.

According to Western news agencies, during the performance of this farce, Jakarta was under strict guard. Before the curtain rose, Suharto mobilized troops, holding a "guard inspection" in Jakarta to show off his military might. Agence France-Presse reported: "Thirty battalions of troops were dispersed to protect the meeting." Tanks lined the roads, and armored vehicles patrolled the city. The Jakarta reactionary authorities also ordered the closure of all schools and banned all demonstrations and parades during the performance of this farce.

According to reports, to defeat his rival, the old lackey of the Americans, Nasution, Suharto climbed from the position of acting president to the presidency. Before the "Provisional People's Consultative Assembly" convened, he adopted a series of deceitful and treacherous plots. On February 9th, Suharto used his authority to reorganize his puppet parliament, appointing sixty-seven new members, thirty-two of whom were his trusted generals and officers. On February 29th, Suharto manipulated the parliament to pass a resolution suggesting his "promotion" to the presidency for five years and ordering the "Provisional People's Consultative Assembly" to immediately convene a meeting to discuss the issue of "appointing" him as president. On March 13th, Suharto appointed one hundred and two members of the "Provisional People's Consultative Assembly," including right-wing generals, officers, and their relatives. In this way, Suharto secured the majority vote in the "Provisional People's Consultative Assembly," ensuring his appointment as president, and further prepared organizationally for his dictatorship and the establishment of militarism.

Suharto's tactics first infuriated Nasution, who had been vying for the presidency for over a decade. Nasution, in his capacity as the chairman of the "Provisional People's Consultative Assembly," presided over the executive committee meeting, emphasizing that Suharto must "respect" his rights and that Suharto must clarify the "legal basis" of his actions. The anti-communist vanguard "Indonesian Youth Student Action Unity Organization," controlled by Nasution, distributed leaflets during Suharto's new parliamentary members' swearing-in ceremony, refusing to recognize Suharto's appointment and withdrawing its twenty representatives from the parliament. Some right-wing parties and organizations took to the streets in succession, attacking Suharto as a "new beneficiary."

Although this Indonesian "Provisional People's Consultative Assembly" appointed Suharto as president, the infighting among the Indonesian reactionaries has not ended. The days of the Indonesian reactionaries are not good, and Suharto helplessly admitted: "The economic deterioration we currently face is indeed serious."

The great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, when talking about American imperialism and its lackeys in various countries, pointed out: "The foundation of this enemy is weak; it is internally divided; it is detached from the people; it has an economic crisis that cannot be resolved; therefore, it can be defeated."

The Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime is precisely such an enemy.

### 苏哈托依靠刺刀爬上总统宝座  印尼右派军人集团内部狗咬狗丑剧愈演愈烈

    苏哈托依靠刺刀爬上总统宝座
    印尼右派军人集团内部狗咬狗丑剧愈演愈烈
    据新华社三十日讯 雅加达消息：美帝国主义的走狗、印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权头目苏哈托，二十七日施展军事手段，从代总统爬上总统宝座。双手沾满印尼共产党人和革命人民鲜血的印尼右派军人集团，将进一步沿着反共、反人民、反华的法西斯道路滑下去。
    印尼法西斯军人政权的御用工具、最高立法机构“临时人民协商会议”，根据苏哈托的命令，在三月二十一日在雅加达敲响了这场争权夺利丑剧的锣鼓，各右派政党经过讨价还价的激烈争吵，二十七日通过了苏哈托担任总统五年的决定。
    据西方通讯社透露，在丑剧上演期间，雅加达戒备森严。丑剧开场前夕，苏哈托调兵遣将，在雅加达举行了“戒备检阅”，炫耀武力。法新社说：“三十个营的军队被分散来保护会议。”公路上布满了坦克，装甲汽车在市内来往巡逻。雅加达反动当局还下令，在丑剧上演期间关闭全部学校，禁止一切示威游行。
    据报道，苏哈托为了战胜他的对手美帝的老牌走狗纳苏蒂安，从代总统爬上总统的宝座，在这次
  “临时人民协商会议”召开之前，采取了一系列尔虞我诈的阴谋手段。二月九日，苏哈托利用职权改组他的御用国会，任命六十七个新成员，其中三十二个是他的亲信将领和军官。二月二十九日，苏哈托操纵国会通过决议，建议“提升”他担任总统五年，并勒令“临时人民协商会议”立即召开会议，讨论“委任”他当总统的问题。三月十三日，苏哈托又任命包括右派将领、军官和他们的家属在内的一百零二名“临时人民协商会议”成员。这样，苏哈托就控制了“临时人民协商会议”的多数票，保证他自己能被任命为总统，并为他实行独裁和建立军国主义统治进一步做好了组织上的准备。
    苏哈托的这一套手段，首先触怒了十几年来争当总统未成的纳苏蒂安。纳苏蒂安以“临时人民协商会议”主席的身份，主持执行委员会会议时，强调苏哈托要“尊重”他的权利，并要苏哈托澄清他自己的行为的“法律根据”。由纳苏蒂安操纵的反共急先锋“印尼青年学生统一行动组织”在苏哈托主持国会新议员就职仪式上，散发传单，不承认苏哈托的任命，并从国会中撤回自己的二十名代表。有些右派政党和团体接连上街示威，攻击苏哈托是“新的既得利益者”。
    这次印尼“临时人民协商会议”虽然任命苏哈托为总统，但印尼反动派内部狗咬狗的争斗并没有结束。印尼反动派的日子很不好过，苏哈托无可奈何供认：“我们现在面临的经济恶化确实是严重的”。
    无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席在谈到美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗的时候指出：“这个敌人的基础是虚弱的，它的内部分崩离析，它脱离人民，它有无法解脱的经济危机，因此，它是能够被战胜的。”
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权正是这样一个敌人。
