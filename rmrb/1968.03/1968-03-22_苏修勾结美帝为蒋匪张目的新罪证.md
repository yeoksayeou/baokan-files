The sixth issue of the 1968 catalog of new Soviet books published by the Soviet International Bookstore features the so-called "national emblem" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits under the guise of promoting the Olympic Games. This is a new piece of evidence of the Soviet revisionist traitors' collusion with the Chiang bandits in their malicious opposition to the great People's Republic of China. This is a despicable provocation by the Soviet revisionist traitors against the great 700 million Chinese people.

The Chiang Kai-shek bandits are a political corpse long since spat upon by the Chinese people. That flag with wolf teeth is nothing but a tattered shroud, stinking to high heaven. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique actually treats it as a treasure, shamelessly promoting it. This shows how far these traitors have fallen.

Khrushchev and his successors, the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique, harbor deep hatred for the Chinese people who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have long been colluding with the Chiang bandits, the enemy of the Chinese people. In 1963, they openly allowed the Chiang bandits to sign the infamous Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty as a "sovereign state." They have repeatedly referred to the territory of Taiwan, where the Chiang bandits are holed up, as a "state" in their publications. They have also sat with the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on the same bench at various international conferences. Now, the Soviet revisionist clique openly prints the black flag of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in their publications. This is certainly not accidental.

The series of criminal acts by the Soviet revisionist clique is a deliberate effort to serve the US imperialists' conspiracy to create "two Chinas." For many years, the US imperialists have been racking their brains to carry out the conspiracy of "two Chinas," but they have not succeeded. They rely on their running dogs and accomplices to help them out. The Soviet revisionist clique has been working hard in this regard. Not long ago, at the United Nations General Assembly, they maliciously linked the issue of restoring China's lawful rights in the United Nations with the issue of admitting two Germanys. This is clearly in collusion with the US imperialists' conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Recently, they even had American officials shout that "Taipei and Beijing should both become members of the United Nations," which is the most shameless and despicable. The Chinese people will certainly settle accounts with the Soviet revisionist clique for these blatant anti-China crimes in collusion with the US.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot,' this is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some foolish people. The reactionaries of various countries are just such a bunch of fools."

The US imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries are colluding to frenziedly oppose China. But their conspiracies are doomed to fail. Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the 700 million Chinese people are marching forward with great strides. Especially after the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the international prestige of socialist China has reached an unprecedented height. The Soviet revisionist clique's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and hostility towards the Chinese people will not harm the glory of the great People's Republic of China in the slightest. It only exposes that they themselves are of the same ilk as the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

### 苏修勾结美帝为蒋匪张目的新罪证

    苏修勾结美帝为蒋匪张目的新罪证
    今年出版的苏修国际书店《苏联新书》目录第六期中，竟借宣传奥林匹克运动会为名，把蒋介石匪帮的所谓“国徽”，赫然登在封面里页上。这是苏修叛徒勾结蒋匪帮恶毒反对伟大的中华人民共和国的新罪证。这是苏修叛徒对伟大的七亿中国人民的卑鄙挑衅。
    蒋介石匪帮是早已被中国人民唾弃的一具政治僵尸，那面狼牙旗不过是一幅破烂的裹尸布，臭不可闻。苏修统治集团居然把它当作宝贝，不知羞耻地为之宣扬。可见这些叛徒已堕落到何等程度了。
    赫鲁晓夫及其继承人勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团，对于高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民，怀有刻骨仇恨。他们早就同中国人民的公敌蒋介石匪帮勾勾搭搭。一九六三年，他们公然让蒋匪帮作为一个“主权国家”在臭名昭著的所谓部分禁止核试验条约上签字。他们一而再、再而三地在报刊上把蒋匪盘踞的我国领土台湾称作“国家”。他们还多次同蒋介石匪帮的“代表”坐在一条板凳上开各种国际会议。现在苏修集团在他们的刊物上明目张胆地刊印蒋介石匪帮的黑旗，这绝不是偶然的。
    苏修集团的这一系列罪恶行径，是蓄意为美帝国主义制造
  “两个中国”的阴谋效劳的。多年以来，美帝国主义为了搞“两个中国”的阴谋，煞费了苦心，但始终未能得逞，因而有赖它的走卒和帮凶助一臂之力。苏修集团就在这方面大卖力气。他们在不久以前召开的联合国大会上，别有用心地把恢复中国在联合国合法权利的问题同接纳两个德国的问题相提并论，这分明是同美帝制造“两个中国”的阴谋相配合。最近，他们竟借美国官员之口，叫嚷什么“台湾和北京都应成为联合国成员”，真是无耻之尤，可恶之极。对于苏修集团这种明火执仗的联美反华罪行，中国人民是一定要清算的。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”
    美帝、苏修和各国反动派，串通一气，疯狂反华。但是，它们的阴谋是注定要失败的。七亿中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下阔步前进。特别是经过史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，社会主义中国的国际威望空前提高。苏修集团勾结蒋介石匪帮，与中国人民为敌，丝毫无损于伟大的中华人民共和国的光辉，只能暴露他们自己同蒋介石匪帮是一丘之貉。
