In recent more than a year, Albanian women have raised high the great red banner of ideological revolutionization, actively participated in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and achieved brilliant successes in the revolutionization movement.

After the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, especially after Comrade Enver Hoxha's speech on "Further Revolutionizing the Party and the State" last February 6, the broad masses of Albanian women, together with the people of the whole country, have actively mobilized themselves. Through various meetings and big-character posters, they have thoroughly criticized the backward ideas and customs of feudalism, clanism, religion, and male chauvinism that oppress women, and have actively promoted socialist new culture, new customs, and new habits. They have also actively participated in political movements against bureaucratism and other issues.

Over the past year, under the battle slogan of "Think, work, and live like a revolutionary," more than 20,000 women in Albania have broken free from the shackles of feudal backward customs and participated in voluntary labor. Tens of thousands of urban women use Sundays to participate in urban public welfare labor. Many women in mountainous areas, in the socialist agricultural collectivization movement, resolutely take the socialist road and actively sign up to join cooperatives.

Through participating in various political movements, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of women has reached an unprecedented height. They are more actively and extensively involved in the political, economic, and cultural life of the country. Currently, among the 240 members of the highest organ of state power in Albania—the People's Assembly, women account for more than 16%. There are more than 10,900 women elected as representatives of people's assemblies at various levels, accounting for more than 36% of the total number of representatives. There are more than 600 women holding leading positions in industrial and mining enterprises and social and cultural institutions. There are 230-plus women serving as chairpersons or deputy chairpersons of agricultural cooperatives.

With the development of the socialist revolution, the number of kindergartens, nurseries, and canteens in urban and rural areas has increased, freeing a large number of women workers to become a powerful force in socialist construction. Currently, women account for 42% of the total number of industrial and agricultural workers in the country. Compared to the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan—1961, the number of female workers has doubled, and the number of female members in agricultural cooperatives has increased by 52%.

To better participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the broad masses of women are actively improving their political theory, cultural, and professional levels. They are actively studying the party's documents and the works of Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Under the guidance of the Party of Labour and the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian women resolutely respond to the call of the Party of Labour of Albania to "hold a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other." They actively participate in shooting, marching, mountain climbing, and other military training, strengthen preparedness, and are ready at any time to give a crushing blow to any enemy who dares to invade socialist Albania.

    在劳动党和伟大领袖霍查同志教导下
    阿尔巴尼亚妇女在革命化大道上勇往直前
    据新华社地拉那七日电　最近一年多来，阿尔巴尼亚妇女高举思想革命化的伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设，在革命化运动中进一步取得了光辉的成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会以后，特别是霍查同志去年二月六日作了关于“党和政权的进一步革命化”的讲话以后，阿尔巴尼亚广大妇女和全国人民一起，积极动员起来，通过各种会议和大字报等形式，大破压迫妇女的封建、宗法、宗教和夫权的落后思想和习俗，大树社会主义的新文化、新风尚和新习惯，并且积极投入了反对官僚主义等政治运动。
    一年多来，在“象革命者一样思考、工作和生活”的战斗口号下，阿尔巴尼亚全国有两万多名妇女，摆脱了封建落后习俗的束缚，参加了义务劳动。成千上万的城市妇女利用星期天参加城市的公益劳动。许多山区的妇女在山区农业集体化运动中，坚决走社会主义道路，积极报名参加合作社。
    广大妇女通过参加各项政治运动，社会主义觉悟空前提高。她们比以前更加广泛和积极地投入到国家政治、经济和文化生活中去。目前，阿尔巴尼亚最高政权机关——人民议会的二百四十名代表中，妇女代表占百分之十六多。全国有一万零九百多名妇女被选为各级人民会议的代表，占全体代表总数的百分之三十六以上。全国共有六百多名妇女担任工矿企业和社会文教机关的领导工作。有二百三十多名妇女担任农业合作社的正副主席。
    随着社会主义革命的发展，城乡托儿所、幼儿园和食堂增加了，大批妇女劳动力得到了解放，成为社会主义建设的一支强大的生力军。现在，全国工农业劳动者总数中有百分之四十二是妇女，同第三个五年计划第一年——一九六一年相比，女职工人数增加了一倍，农业合作社女社员增加了百分之五十二。
    为了更好地参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设，广大妇女还积极提高自己的政治理论、文化和业务水平。广大妇女积极学习党的文件和霍查同志的著作。
    在劳动党和伟大领袖霍查同志教导下的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚妇女，坚决响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的号召，积极参加射击、行军、爬山等军事训练，加强战备，时刻准备给任何敢于侵犯社会主义阿尔巴尼亚的敌人以毁灭性的打击。
