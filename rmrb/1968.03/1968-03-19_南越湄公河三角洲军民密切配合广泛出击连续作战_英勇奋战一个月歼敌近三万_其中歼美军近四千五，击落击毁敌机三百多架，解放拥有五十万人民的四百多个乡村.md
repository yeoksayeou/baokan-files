The military and civilians of the Mekong Delta in South Vietnam have closely coordinated and launched widespread attacks, engaging in continuous battles. They have fought bravely for a month, annihilating nearly 30,000 enemy troops. Among them, nearly 4,500 American troops were annihilated, over 300 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed, and more than 400 villages with a population of 500,000 were liberated.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, March 18 - According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the military and civilians of the Mekong Delta in South Vietnam, in coordination with other battlefields, launched widespread attacks on 65 enemy-occupied towns and military bases, as well as all enemy-occupied rural areas, from January 30 to February 29. They achieved the brilliant results of annihilating nearly 30,000 enemy troops and demoralizing tens of thousands of enemy troops.

	Among the annihilated enemy troops were nearly 4,500 American invaders. The enemy's 18 infantry battalions, 5 armored battalions, and 96 companies were wiped out or severely damaged.

	Many of the enemy's military and political headquarters, including the staff of the puppet army's Fourth Military Region, the headquarters of the 7th, 9th, and 21st Divisions, the headquarters of the 2nd Brigade of the U.S. 9th Infantry Division, and the command posts of nine regiments and four military districts, as well as the offices of many provincial puppet governors and other puppet government agencies, were successively attacked by the people's liberation armed forces. The flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fluttered in the wind in the provincial capitals and many towns of ten provinces.

	During this period, the military and civilians of the Mekong Delta launched repeated attacks on the enemy's seven airfields, two naval bases, and many logistics bases, causing serious damage to the enemy's war tools and combat supplies. This included the destruction of 340 aircraft, the destruction of more than 500 military vehicles, the sinking or damaging of 82 ships, and the destruction and burning of thousands of tons of ammunition and tens of thousands of liters of gasoline.

	The local military and civilians also cut off and controlled many of the enemy's water and land transportation routes, causing the transportation on the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th highways, as well as the Mekong River, the Ham Luong River, and the My Tho Canal, to frequently fall into a state of paralysis.

	Under the fierce attacks of the military and civilians of the Mekong Delta, the puppet regime collapsed in large areas. Nearly 600 outposts and fortifications were leveled, forced to surrender, or forced to retreat. More than 450 villages with a population of 500,000 were liberated. Many places in the liberated areas have connected villages and counties, directly threatening the lairs of the American puppet group.

	In addition, the people of the delta also destroyed three enemy prisons, rescuing thousands of imprisoned patriots. (See attached picture)
