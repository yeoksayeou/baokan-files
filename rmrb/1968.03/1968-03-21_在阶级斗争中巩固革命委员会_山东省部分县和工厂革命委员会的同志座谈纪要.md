Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary committees have been established at various levels. The question facing these committees after their establishment is how to effectively exercise power and use it correctly. Shandong Province's Wulian County, Laoshan County, Jinan Locomotive Factory, Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, and Qingdao Steel Plant are among the earliest regions and units to achieve the "three-in-one combination" and establish revolutionary committees. Recently, we invited responsible comrades from these regions and units to discuss their experiences in exercising power and using it correctly.

A thousand tasks, ten thousand tasks, the first and foremost is to grasp the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To grasp ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to engage in great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the party's political tasks cannot be completed."

Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "Navigating the great seas relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

The comrades participating in the discussion all agreed that the primary task of the revolutionary committees is to grasp the study of Mao Zedong Thought. The most important thing for the proletarian revolutionary faction to exercise power is to grasp the power to study, propagate, implement, and defend Mao Zedong Thought. Leading with Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the ideological transformation of the people, this is the politics within politics, the soul within the soul, the core within the core. To follow the great leader Chairman Mao, we must study Mao Zedong Thought deeply and apply it actively. Revolutionary committees that act according to Mao Zedong Thought have authority, but without Mao Zedong Thought, they cannot take a single step forward. The work of the revolutionary committees is complex and varied, and they must break free from trivial matters and focus on the fundamentals. Only by grasping the study of Mao Zedong Thought can we effectively fight against class enemies, win battles in the struggle between the two lines, and enable the revolutionary committees to play their due role.

Comrade Cheng Zenglu of the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory Revolutionary Committee said: Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. To carry out work well, the revolutionary committee must focus on the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Conducting study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The revolutionary committee must vigorously conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Last year, when our factory established the revolutionary committee, there were still disagreements within. Some wanted to organize their own factions and vie for more seats; some, while in the revolutionary committee, still had their hearts in their own organizations, serving their own little factions. Later, with the help of the stationed soldiers, we held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The leaders of various factions, with Mao Zedong Thought as the criterion, conducted self-criticism and heart-to-heart talks, criticized bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and fought against selfishness. Subsequently, we mobilized the masses to conduct more study classes. Not only the factory but also the workshops, departments, teams, and families conducted them. From April last year to January this year, over 20,000 people participated in various types of study classes, significantly raising the class consciousness of the workers and severely striking down bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and various non-proletarian thoughts. On this basis, the upper and lower levels became more united, and the revolutionary committee became more consolidated.

Everyone agreed that conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes is the best way to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and must be persisted in. In the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, we must be lifelong students.

Lead the masses to firmly grasp class struggle and consolidate the revolutionary committee in the struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle."

The comrades participating in the discussion believe that after the establishment of the revolutionary committees, there must be no thought of "relaxing and taking a break." Because the establishment of the revolutionary committees does not mean the end of class struggle, class struggle will inevitably continue in the new situation. Establishing a revolutionary committee is to better carry out class struggle and to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, to carry out the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines to the end. Everyone said that class enemies will never willingly accept their own destruction and will definitely be very hostile to the newly born revolutionary committees. They will certainly adopt open or covert means to sabotage and disrupt, interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment from the right or ultra-"left" side, and even try to infiltrate our ranks, attempting to seize the leadership of the revolutionary committees from within and overthrow the newly born revolutionary committees. Therefore, we must never relax our revolutionary vigilance.

The comrades participating in the discussion also believe that the revolutionary committee can only consolidate itself by leading the masses forward in class struggle, fighting a few hard battles, and winning a few victories. The revolutionary committee must become a strong command center for grasping class struggle. Members of the revolutionary committee must be good at using Chairman Mao's class struggle viewpoint and class analysis method to observe and analyze everything, have a keen political sense, stand on the frontline of class struggle, lead the masses in charging forward, and fight resolutely against class enemies.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Comrade Han Renjun of the Jinan Locomotive Factory Revolutionary Committee said: Before and after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" and related discussions on class struggle, clearly recognizing that to exercise power correctly, we must firmly grasp class struggle. The facts are indeed so. Even before the revolutionary committee was established, when the revolutionary masses were brewing the list of revolutionary committee members, a small handful of class enemies stirred up trouble, spreading rumors and doing everything possible to sabotage the establishment of the revolutionary committee. At that time, we mobilized the masses to expose these bad elements. Through a fierce class struggle, we exposed these bad elements one by one, clearing the obstacles for the establishment of the revolutionary committee.

Comrade Dai Delian of the Laoshan County Revolutionary Committee said: To grasp class struggle, we must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, lead the situation, and achieve victory. After our county established the revolutionary committee in February last year, the capitalist roaders deceived some of the masses and did everything possible to oppose the "little people" taking power, launching an attack on the newly established revolutionary committee. At this time, we followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carried out extensive revolutionary criticism, and severely criticized the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and a small handful of capitalist roaders in our county. The more we criticized, the more the broad revolutionary masses hated these class enemies, the more they loved the great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the more they loved their own revolutionary committee. Those who were deceived, the vast majority also raised their class consciousness through revolutionary criticism, gradually changed, and supported the revolutionary committee.

Firmly exercise power with proletarian party spirit.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We stand on the side of the proletariat and the people. For Communist Party members, this means standing on the side of the party, on the side of party spirit and party policy."

The comrades participating in the discussion believe that only by firmly standing on the party spirit advocated by Chairman Mao and using proletarian party spirit as the criterion for speech and action can we exercise power correctly and gain the support and trust of the masses. Exercising power with proletarian party spirit is to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions in everything, "acting in the interests of the people, not in the interests of individuals or small groups."

Comrade Wang Xianbian of the Wulian County Revolutionary Committee said: To exercise power correctly, the revolutionary committee must always pay attention to "orientation" with Mao Zedong Thought. After our revolutionary committee was established, the members first studied the "Old Five Articles," discussed who the revolutionary committee's power belongs to, for whom we exercise power, and how to exercise power. Everyone realized that the revolutionary committee's power is not the power of an individual or a faction, but the power of the proletariat; we do not exercise power for an individual or a faction, but for the proletariat; members of the revolutionary committee cannot exercise power with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and individualism, but must exercise power with Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian party spirit. Through this study, our work direction became clearer.

Comrade Zhang Shouzong of the Qingdao Steel Plant Revolutionary Committee said: After our revolutionary committee was established last year, due to some comrades not having cleared their bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism from their minds, when social struggles fluctuated, some comrades in the revolutionary committee had factionalism flare up and came out to form factions again. At that time, some comrades said: "We have the numbers and strength, let them step aside." Most comrades did not agree with this, believing that only by acting according to the principles of proletarian party spirit can problems be solved. If factionalism is met with factionalism, it will only make things worse. With the help of the stationed soldiers, we had the leaders of both sides sit together, study Chairman Mao's works, and conduct self-criticism. The comrades who formed factions realized their mistakes and fell for the class enemies' tricks, and returned to the team to participate in the great alliance of revolution. We felt that acting according to proletarian party spirit would gain the support of the masses and smoothly carry out work; acting according to bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism would lead to biased thinking and actions, deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and would definitely be opposed by the masses and would inevitably collapse!

Oppose becoming officials and lords, forever rooting among the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members must never detach themselves from the masses, never stand above the masses, acting as officials and lords, but should appear before the masses as ordinary laborers, immerse themselves among the masses, and blend with the masses."

In the discussion, everyone believed that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the most thorough mass line. Whether the members of the revolutionary committee are "official lords" or servants of the people; whether they are willing to be students of the masses or regard themselves as leaders; whether they believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and maintain close ties with the masses, or whether they are self-righteous and stand above the masses, detaching themselves from the masses, this is not a simple matter of work style, but a manifestation of the struggle between the two lines. "The masses are the true heroes," and they are the foundation of the revolutionary committee. Members of the revolutionary committee can only stand firm and have a basis for action by rooting among the masses and obtaining the support, help, and supervision of the masses. After the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power, no matter how things change, the spirit of ordinary laborers must not change, and the blood-tie relationship with the masses must not change.

Comrade Cheng Zenglu of the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory Revolutionary Committee said: The masses' concern and supervision of the activities of the revolutionary committee members, and their timely criticism of our shortcomings and mistakes, are good things and a sign that the revolutionary committee has a mass base. We must correctly treat the masses' opinions. For a period, when the masses sharply criticized our shortcomings, we were a bit impatient. Some comrades said: "I work day and night, but it's still not appreciated." At this time, the stationed soldiers organized us to study the "Old Three Articles" and use the standard of "complete" and "thorough" service to the people for comparison. We realized that the thought of "working hard but not being appreciated" was the bourgeois idea of fame, profit, and power at work. Because of the change in position, we unknowingly picked up some official airs. Chairman Mao teaches us to be the "ox" of the proletariat and the people, to dedicate ourselves and die for the cause. Since the "ox" has problems and the steps are not coordinated, it is completely reasonable for the revolutionary masses to whip it on the back. This is concern and care, and it should not be resisted. The masses elected us to work in the revolutionary committee, not to become officials, but to revolutionize. Therefore, we not only welcome the masses' criticism and supervision but also strive to obtain the masses' criticism and supervision, so that our shortcomings can be discovered and corrected in time. Only in this way can we be united from top to bottom, form a single force, and advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to victory.

Comrade Zhang Shouzong of the Qingdao Steel Plant Revolutionary Committee said: At the beginning, due to lack of experience, the comrades of our factory's revolutionary committee were busy with trivial matters all day. Some masses said: "During the rebellion, there were many comrades, but after taking power, comrades are not seen." This alerted us. We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao often teaches us that any Communist Party member, regardless of seniority or position, must regard themselves as the son of the people, be honest and sincere, and be a servant of the people. Some old cadres also talked about the lessons of making mistakes due to detachment from the masses. This made us realize that detachment from the masses is very dangerous. We then formulated measures to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses: the 14 standing committee members of the factory revolutionary committee usually only leave one or two people to handle daily work, and the rest all go deep into the teams. Where there are more problems and difficulties, we go there. In this way, the relationship between cadres and the masses improved quickly, and the authority of the revolutionary committee also increased. Workers said: "Cadres and we have heart-to-heart connections, they are truly our confidants." Some old difficult problems were also solved. For example, in the production of seamless steel pipes in our factory, the acid mist is very large during the pickling process, seriously affecting the health of the workers and seriously affecting production. Before the Cultural Revolution, this problem had not been solved. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the leadership went deep into the production frontline and worked with the masses to find solutions. Everyone worked together, spending only 3,000 yuan to make a fume extractor that used to cost 30,000 yuan, solving this problem. This is the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, this is the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

The key lies in the leadership cadre's breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit, being infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To ensure that our party and state do not change color, we need not only a correct line and policy but also to cultivate and train tens of millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause."

How to prevent the newly born revolutionary committee from taking the old road? How to continuously consolidate the revolutionary committee? Everyone agreed during the discussion that the key to the key is the ideological transformation of the leadership core. The leadership cadre issue is a state power issue. Only by doing a good job in the ideological transformation of the leadership members, making the leadership members become steadfast warriors infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, can the revolutionary committee not change color and forever advance along the revolutionary course indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao. Everyone believes that to do a good job in ideological transformation, we must firmly grasp the study of Mao Zedong Thought, must thoroughly break with selfishness, and build a great wall of public spirit in the depths of the soul.

Comrade Cheng Zenglu of the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory Revolutionary Committee said: The most important sign of the ideological transformation of the leadership cadre is infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. This is the concentrated expression of our proletarian revolutionary faction's high class consciousness and line struggle consciousness. We must forge a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao on the battlefield of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. With infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, we can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step, can implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the spirit of "seizing the day," can do as Chairman Mao says, go where Chairman Mao points, can fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive and die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line after death. Our factory's revolutionary committee, to promote the ideological transformation of the leadership cadre, in addition to usually focusing on the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, also conducted five rectification campaigns, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, with high standards and strict requirements, to fight against selfishness. We feel that the deeper the fight against selfishness, the more loyal to Chairman Mao; the more resolute the fight against selfishness, the closer to Chairman Mao. Because we firmly grasped the fight against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, we continuously promoted the ideological transformation of the leadership cadre, making the work of the revolutionary committee continuously improved and elevated.

    在阶级斗争中巩固革命委员会
    ——山东省部分县和工厂革命委员会的同志座谈纪要
    在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，各级革命委员会大批建立起来了。革命委员会建立以后面临的问题，是怎样掌好权，用好权？山东省的五莲县、崂山县、济南机车厂、青岛四方机车车辆厂、青岛钢厂等，都是较早地实现三结合，建立革命委员会的地区和单位。最近，我们请这些地区和单位革委会的负责同志座谈了掌权、用权的经验。
    千件事，万件事，抓好活学活用毛泽东思想是第一件事
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”
    林副主席指示我们：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
    参加座谈的同志都认为，革委会的首要任务就是抓好毛泽东思想的学习。无产阶级革命派掌权，最重要的是掌好学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛泽东思想的权。用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，这是政治中的政治，灵魂中的灵魂，核心中的核心。我们要紧跟伟大导师毛主席，就要对毛泽东思想学得深，用得活。革命委员会按毛泽东思想办事就有权威，离开毛泽东思想就寸步难行。革委会工作千头万绪，必须从烦琐的事务中解脱出来，狠抓根本。只有抓好毛泽东思想的学习，才能有效地同阶级敌人作斗争，才能在两条路线斗争中打胜仗，才能使革委会发挥应有的作用。
    青岛四方机车车辆厂革委会程增禄同志说：毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，革委会要很好地开展工作，就必须在活学活用毛泽东思想上狠下功夫。毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”革委会必须大力办好毛泽东思想学习班。去年，我们厂刚成立革委会的时候，内部仍有分歧。有的想拉队伍另立山头，为自己组织多争几个席位；有的身在革委会，心在自己的组织里，为自己的小山头服务。后来，在驻厂解放军同志的帮助下，我们举办了毛泽东思想学习班。几派头头在一起，以毛泽东思想为指针，开展自我批评和谈心活动，清算了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，狠斗了“私”字。接着，我们又发动群众办起更多的学习班。不但工厂办，车间、科室、班组、家庭也办。从去年四月到今年一月，全厂参加各种类型学习班的人员达二万多人次，大大提高了职工的阶级觉悟，狠狠打击了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和各种非无产阶级思想。在这个基础上，上下更加一致，革委会也更加巩固。
    大家一致认为，办好毛泽东思想学习班，是落实毛主席最新指示的最好的办法，必须坚持不懈地办下去。我们在活学活用毛泽东思想方面，要做一个永不结业的学生。
    带领群众狠抓阶级斗争，在斗争中巩固革委会
    毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”
    参加座谈的同志认为，革委会建立以后，绝不能有“松口气，歇一歇”的思想。因为革委会的建立，绝不意味着阶级斗争的结束，阶级斗争必然在新形势下继续。成立革委会，就是为了更好地进行阶级斗争，为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争进行到底。大家说，阶级敌人绝不会甘心于自己的灭亡，对新生的革委会一定会十分仇视，它们必然会采取公开或隐蔽的方式从事破坏和捣乱，从右的或极“左”的方面来干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，甚至会削尖脑袋钻到我们的队伍中来，妄图从内部篡夺革委会的领导权，颠覆新生的革委会。因此，我们绝对不能丝毫松懈自己的革命警惕性。
    参加座谈的同志还认为，革委会只有在阶级斗争中带领群众前进，打几个硬仗，打几个胜仗，才能在群众中建立威信，确立起无产阶级的革命权威，革命委员会才能巩固。革命委员会，要成为抓阶级斗争的坚强的指挥部。革委会的成员，要善于用毛主席的阶级斗争的观点和阶级分析的方法去观察一切，分析一切，要有敏锐的政治嗅觉，要站在阶级斗争的第一线，带领群众冲锋陷阵，同阶级敌人进行坚决的斗争。
   “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”济南机车厂革委会韩仁俊同志说：我们在建立革委会前后，反复学习了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》和有关阶级斗争的论述，明确认识到要掌好权、用好权，必须狠抓阶级斗争。事实也是如此。还在革委会成立前夕，革命群众正在酝酿革委会成员名单的时候，一小撮阶级敌人就兴风作浪，造谣生事，千方百计破坏革委会的建立。当时，我们就发动群众起来清查坏人。经过一场激烈的阶级斗争，把这些坏人一个个揪了出来，为建立革命委员会扫除了障碍。
    崂山县革委会戴德良同志说：抓阶级斗争，要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，因势利导，夺取胜利。我们县去年二月建立革委会以后，走资派蒙蔽部分群众，千方百计反对“小人物”掌权，向刚刚建立的革委会发动进攻。这时候，我们根据毛主席的伟大战略部署，广泛开展了革命的大批判，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和本县党内一小撮走资派的滔天罪行。越批判，广大革命群众就越恨这些阶级敌人，就越热爱伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席的革命路线，就越热爱自己的革委会。那些受蒙蔽的群众，绝大部分也在革命大批判中提高了阶级觉悟，逐渐转变过来，拥护和支持革命委员会。
    坚决用无产阶级党性掌权
    毛主席教导我们：“我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。”
    参加座谈的同志认为，只有坚决站在毛主席教导的党性立场上，用无产阶级党性作为革委会成员的言论和行动的准则，才能掌好权，用好权，才能得到群众的拥护和信任。用无产阶级党性掌权，就是要处处按照毛主席的指示办事，“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。
    五莲县革委会王先鞭同志说：革委会要掌好权，用好权，就要时刻注意用毛泽东思想“定向”。我们革委会成立以后，革委会成员首先学习“老五篇”，讨论了革委会是谁的权，我们为谁掌权，以及怎样掌权的问题。大家认识到，革委会的权，不是那一个人或那一派的权，而是无产阶级的权；我们不是为个人或那一派掌权，而是为无产阶级掌权；革委会成员不能用资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和个人主义掌权，而是要用毛泽东思想、用无产阶级党性掌权。通过这次学习，我们的工作方向就更加明确了。
    青岛钢厂革委会张守忠同志说：我们去年成立革委会以后，由于有些同志头脑里资产阶级、小资产阶级派性没有清除，当社会上的斗争出现反复的时候，革委会中有的同志就派性发作，重新出来拉山头。当时，有的同志说：“我们人多势大，干脆让他们靠边站。”多数同志不同意这样做，认为只有按无产阶级党性原则办事才能解决问题，如果以派性对派性，就会把事情搞得更糟。在驻厂解放军同志帮助下，我们双方的头头坐在一起，学习毛主席著作，开展自我批评。拉山头的同志认识到自己犯了错误，上了阶级敌人的当，又拉回队伍参加革命的大联合。我们感到，按无产阶级党性办事，就能受到群众拥护，顺利地开展工作；按资产阶级、小资产阶级派性办事，就会心偏、眼偏，偏离毛主席的革命路线，就一定会受到群众反对，发展下去非垮台不可！
    反对做官当老爷，永远扎根于群众中
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，而应当以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。”
    座谈中，大家认为，毛主席的革命路线就是最彻底的群众路线。革委会成员是当“官老爷”，还是当人民的勤务员；是甘当群众的小学生，还是以领导者自居；是相信群众，依靠群众，密切联系群众，还是自以为是，高高在上，脱离群众，这绝不是简单的工作作风问题，而是两条路线斗争的表现。“群众是真正的英雄”，是革委会的基础。革委会成员只有立足于群众之中，得到群众的支持、帮助和监督，脚跟才站得稳，办事才有依靠。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，千变万变，普通劳动者的本色不能变，同群众血肉相连的关系不能变。
    青岛四方机车车辆厂革委会程增禄同志说：群众关心和监督革委会成员的活动，及时批评我们的缺点错误，是件大好事，是革委会有群众基础的表现。我们必须正确地对待群众的意见。有段时间，当群众对我们的缺点尖锐地提出批评的时候，我们有些沉不住气。有的同志说：“我白天黑夜干，还出力不讨好。”这时候，驻厂解放军同志就组织我们学习“老三篇”，用“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的标准进行对照，认识到这个“出力不讨好”的想法就是资产阶级的名、利、权的思想在作怪。自己因为地位变了，不知不觉地就沾染了一些官气。毛主席教导我们，要“做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”。既然“牛”有了毛病，步子走得不协调，革命群众在他背上加一鞭是完全应该的，这是关心和爱护，不应该抵触。群众推选我们到革委会来工作，不是要我们来做官，而是要我们来革命。因此，我们不但要欢迎群众的批评监督，而且要争取群众的批评监督，使我们有缺点能及时发现，及时改正。这样，才能上下心连心，拧成一股绳，沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进。
    青岛钢厂革委会张守忠同志说：我厂革委会的同志，开始由于经验不足，整天浮在上面忙事务。有些群众就说：“造反时战友一大片，掌权后战友不见面。”这引起了我们的警惕。我们带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席的教导。毛主席经常教育我们，任何一个共产党员，不论资格大小，职位高低，都必须把自己看成是人民的儿子，老老实实地，诚诚恳恳地，当人民的勤务员。有的老干部也谈了因为脱离群众而犯错误的教训。这使我们认识到，脱离群众就会脱离毛主席的革命路线，是非常危险的。我们便制订了改善干群关系的措施：厂革委会十四个常委，平时只留一两个人主持日常工作，其余的人全部深入班组。那里问题多，那里困难大，就到那里去。这样，干群关系很快改善了，革委会的威信也提高了。工人们说：“干部和我们心贴心，真是我们的知心人。”一些老大难的问题也得到了解决。如厂里生产无缝钢管，在酸洗过程中，酸雾很大，严重影响职工的身体健康，严重影响生产。文化大革命以前，这个问题一直没有解决。革委会成立以后，领导深入生产第一线，和群众一起想办法。大家一起动手，只花三千元就制成了过去要用三万元的排雾器，解决了这个问题。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，这是毛主席的革命路线的胜利！
  关键在于领导班子破私立公，无限忠于伟大导师毛主席
    毛主席教导我们：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    如何使新生的革命委员会不走老路？怎样使革委会不断巩固？大家在座谈时一致认为，关键的关键在于领导核心的思想革命化。领导班子问题就是政权问题。只有搞好领导成员的思想革命化，使领导成员成为无限忠于毛主席的坚强战士，才能使革委会不变颜色，永远沿着伟大导师毛主席指引的革命航道前进。大家认为，要搞好思想革命化，必须狠抓毛泽东思想的学习，必须和“私”字彻底决裂，在灵魂深处筑起“公”字的长城。
    青岛四方机车车辆厂革委会程增禄同志说：领导班子思想革命化的最最重要的标志，就是无限忠于伟大导师毛主席。这是我们无产阶级革命派高度的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟的集中表现。我们要在斗私、批修战场上，锤炼出一颗永远无限忠于毛主席的红心。有了对毛主席的无限忠心，就能对毛主席的伟大战略部署步步紧跟，就能以“只争朝夕”的精神去全面落实毛主席的最新指示；就能做到毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做，毛主席指向那里，我们就奔向那里；就能生为毛主席的革命路线战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线献身。我们厂的革委会为了促进领导班子思想革命化，除了平时大抓活学活用毛主席著作，还先后五次整风，以毛泽东思想为武器，高标准、严要求地狠斗“私”字。我们体会到，斗私越深，对毛主席越忠；斗私越狠，跟毛主席越紧。因为我们狠抓了斗私批修，就不断促进了领导班子的思想革命化，使革委会的工作不断得到改进和提高。
