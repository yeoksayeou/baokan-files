Under the thunderous blows of the Spring Offensive by the Vietnamese people in South Vietnam, the contradictions between the U.S. and the puppet regime, as well as within the puppet regime itself, have further intensified. They are blaming each other, accusing each other, and sabotaging each other, falling into a state of chaos.

According to reports, under the fierce attacks of the Vietnamese people in South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors, who suffered an unprecedented defeat, have been cursing the Saigon puppet regime for being corrupt and incompetent. In recent periods, U.S. officials and media have publicly condemned the Saigon puppet government for lacking "bold and strong leadership," being "one of the most corrupt governments in the world," and being "pessimistic and helpless" after suffering heavy blows, "leaving the country (referring to the South Vietnamese puppet regime) in a state of semi-paralysis." The U.S. masters have also blamed the puppet army for being useless, unable to defend even the cities, forcing the U.S. to deploy a large number of troops to guard the cities. The Saigon puppet regime, in turn, has retaliated, expressing dissatisfaction with the U.S. master's deployment in Khe Sanh, even publicly attacking, saying that defending Khe Sanh is the U.S. "sacrificing their strategic flexibility for questionable political prestige." Especially, the puppet regime, fearing that the People's Liberation Armed Forces will launch another large-scale attack on Saigon, has recently shouted: "The war will not be decided by Khe Sanh, nor even by (South Vietnam) the North, but by Saigon itself." The Saigon puppet regime has also incited Saigon newspapers to strongly criticize U.S. actions and policies.

On the battlefield, the U.S. and puppet forces, which have always had sharp contradictions, have seen their conflicts further escalate after suffering heavy blows, even to the point of fighting each other. During the fierce battle in Hue, the U.S. Marine Corps, driven to desperation by the Hue people, openly fired on the puppet army to seize rations. In the early hours of February 3, the puppet army in Binh Dinh Province's Tuy Hoa City, while retreating, was heavily fired upon by the "rescuing" U.S. troops, killing hundreds. Incidents of the puppet army rebelling against the oppression of the U.S. aggressors have been rampant. Many puppet soldiers have increasingly seen through the true face of the U.S. aggressors, turning their guns on them in retaliation. On February 16, the puppet soldiers stationed at Loc Ninh Airport in Long An Province cooperated with the People's Liberation Armed Forces to launch a fierce attack on the U.S. troops inside the airport, annihilating all the U.S. aggressors. A platoon of puppet soldiers in a certain place in Thua Thien Province also joined the revolutionary forces to beat the U.S. aggressors.

The South Vietnamese traitorous clique, facing new defeats, has seen internal strife escalate. The contradictions between the puppet "President" Nguyen Van Thieu and his "Vice President" Nguyen Cao Ky, who have been sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, have further surfaced. On February 20, Nguyen Cao Ky suddenly announced his resignation from the chairmanship of the so-called "Restoration Committee" established by the puppet regime after the Spring Offensive defeat, putting pressure on Nguyen Van Thieu. Regarding this, the Associated Press could not help but lament that the puppet regime, despite facing "serious challenges," "Nguyen Cao Ky still could not work with Nguyen Van Thieu." Nguyen Van Thieu and the puppet legislature are also riddled with contradictions. Nguyen Van Thieu attempted to use the Spring Offensive defeat to seize power, demanding that the two houses of the puppet legislature grant him "special powers," but the puppet House of Representatives and Senate rejected Nguyen Van Thieu's demand on March 1 and 7, respectively. At the same time, the puppet "Prime Minister" Nguyen Van Loc's cabinet has been criticized as "incompetent," and its position is precarious. Some puppet military leaders have been replaced due to consecutive defeats. In late February, within three days, two of the four puppet military tactical zone commanders in South Vietnam were replaced: the commander of the puppet Fourth Tactical Zone, which oversees the Mekong Delta, and the commander of the puppet Second Tactical Zone, which oversees the Central Highlands and coastal areas.

The Saigon puppet regime, in a desperate struggle, has been arresting anti-U.S. and anti-puppet figures while also taking the opportunity to eliminate political opponents, arresting thousands of people by February 27. This has further intensified the contradictions among the various factions of running dogs, making the puppet regime even more shaky.

　　在南越军民新春攻势沉重打击下
　　美伪之间和傀儡集团内部矛盾加剧
　　彼此互相埋怨互相指责互相拆台陷于一片混乱
    新华社河内十一日电  在越南南方军民新春攻势雷霆万钧般的打击下，美伪集团主奴之间和奴才内部的矛盾进一步加剧，它们互相埋怨，互相指责，陷于一片混乱中。
    据报道，在越南南方军民猛烈的进攻下遭到空前惨败的美国侵略者，为了给自己遮羞，大骂西贡傀儡集团腐败无能。最近一个时期内，美国官员和报刊公开骂西贡傀儡政权“没有大胆、强有力的领导”，“是世界上最腐败的政府之一”，在遭到沉重打击后“悲观和手足无措”，“使这个国家（指南越傀儡政权）处于半瘫痪状态”。美国主子还大肆责怪伪军不中用，连城市都守不住，使得美国不得不部署大量的美军看守城市。而西贡傀儡集团也反唇相讥，不满美国主子困守溪山的部署，甚至公开攻击说，死守溪山是美国人“为了值得怀疑的政治威信，而牺牲了他们在战略上的灵活性”。特别是傀儡集团由于害怕人民解放武装力量再一次大规模进攻西贡，最近更大叫：“战争不会决定于溪山，甚至于也不会决定于（越南南方）北部，而是决定于西贡本身。”西贡傀儡集团还怂恿西贡报刊大肆抨击美国的行动和政策。
    在战场上，一向有着尖锐矛盾的美伪军，遭到沉重打击以后，矛盾进一步发展，甚至火并。在顺化的激烈战斗中，被顺化军民打得焦头烂额的美国海军陆战队为了抢夺口粮，公然向伪军开枪。驻在边和省春禄市的伪军二月三日凌晨在败逃时，前往“救援”的美军向这些伪军逃兵猛烈扫射，打死数百名。伪军不堪美国侵略军的欺压而起来反抗的事件也层出不穷。很多伪军士兵越来越认清美国侵略者的面目，他们毅然掉转枪口，给美国侵略者反戈一击。驻在芹苴省洛代机场的伪军官兵二月十六日配合人民解放武装力量，猛烈进攻机场内的美军，把美国侵略军全部歼灭。承天省某地一个排伪军也同革命力量一起痛打美国侵略军。
    南越卖国集团在新的惨败面前内讧愈演愈烈。同床异梦的伪正副“总统”阮文绍和阮高其之间的矛盾也进一步表面化。阮高其在二月二十日突然宣布辞去傀儡集团在新春惨败后成立的所谓“恢复委员会主席”的职务，向阮文绍施加压力。对此，美联社也不能不哀叹说，傀儡集团尽管面临“严重挑战”，
  “但是阮高其仍无法同阮文绍共事”。阮文绍同伪议会之间也是矛盾重重。阮文绍企图利用新春大败乘机独揽大权，他要求伪议会两院给予他“特别权力”，但伪众议院和参议院先后在三月一日和七日否决了阮文绍的要求。同时，伪“总理”阮文碌的内阁也被指责为“无能”，地位岌岌可危。一些伪军头目因连吃败仗而被换马。在二月下旬的三天内，在南越的四个伪军战术区司令中，就有管辖湄公河三角洲的伪第四战术地区和管辖中部高原和沿海地区的伪第二战术地区的两名司令被撤换。
    西贡傀儡集团为了进行垂死挣扎，在大肆逮捕反美伪的人士的同时，还乘机排斥异己，大肆逮捕对立派。据西方通讯社报道，到二月二十七日为止，就有五千多人被捕。这就进一步加剧了各派走狗之间的矛盾，使傀儡集团更加处于风雨飘摇之中。
