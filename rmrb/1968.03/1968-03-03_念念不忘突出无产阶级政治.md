After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, there are countless tasks to attend to. What should be prioritized first?

The experience of the revolutionary committee of Hangjinhou Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region once again proves that in any situation, one must never forget to promote proletarian politics. Political work must be placed in the first position, and it cannot be placed in the second or third position, nor can it be on the same level as other work.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true during periods of fundamental change in the socio-economic system." Political work is about guiding thoughts, souls, and revolutionization. It is the overall leader of all sectors. Without politics, there is no soul, no direction, no initiative, no creativity, no consciousness, and nothing to lead.

Promoting proletarian politics means leading with Mao Zedong Thought, and carrying out the revolutionization of people's thinking. This is the core of politics, the essence of the soul, and the heart of the heart. It is a major issue concerning the survival of the state, the party, and the government, and it is a major issue concerning whether the people gain everything or lose everything.

We have been fighting the revolution for decades, and we have always relied on promoting proletarian politics and the great Mao Zedong Thought to achieve victory. Our party has become the Communist Party, our army has become the People's Liberation Army, and our government has become the proletarian government, all because of proletarian politics and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to promote proletarian politics and establish Mao Zedong Thought. It is a revolution that touches people's souls. The deeper the revolution goes, the more we need to consciously promote proletarian politics at a higher level, firmly lead with Mao Zedong Thought, and with greater revolutionary enthusiasm, invest more effort in doing thorough, detailed, and arduous political work among the masses to vigorously promote the revolutionization of people's thinking.

In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all levels of revolutionary committees must take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, and vigorously promote the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. Aimed at the active thoughts of the masses in completing the five battle tasks proposed by the Central Committee, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes should be organized. Through these study classes, organize the masses and cadres to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, criticize and repudiate private thoughts and revisionism, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, overthrow anarchism, and overthrow counter-revolutionary economism. Enhance proletarian party spirit, and improve revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline. Firmly lead the masses to advance according to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and great strategic deployment.

    念念不忘突出无产阶级政治
    本报评论员
    革命委员会成立以后，工作千头万绪，首先应该抓什么？
    内蒙古自治区杭锦后旗革命委员会的经验又一次证明：不论在任何情况下，都必须念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，必须把政治工作摆在第一位，而决不能摆在第二位、第三位，也不能和其他工作摆在同等地位。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”政治工作是管思想、管灵魂、管革命化的，是各行各业的总管。政治统帅一切。没有政治就没有灵魂，没有方向，没有积极性、创造性，没有觉悟，没有带头的挂帅的东西。
    突出无产阶级政治，就是用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化。这是政治中间的政治，是灵魂中间的灵魂，是核心中间的核心。这是关系到国家的存亡，党的存亡，政权的存亡的大问题，是关系到人民得到一切或者丧失一切的大问题。
    我们干了几十年的革命，历来就是靠突出无产阶级政治，靠伟大的毛泽东思想取得胜利的。我们的党所以成为共产党，我们的军队所以成为人民解放军，我们的政权所以成为无产阶级的政权，就是因为有了无产阶级政治，有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场突出无产阶级政治、大立毛泽东思想的大革命，是触及人们灵魂的大革命。革命越是深入，就越需要我们更加自觉地在更高水平上坚持突出无产阶级政治，坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，就越需要我们用更高的革命热情，花更大的功夫，向广大群众做深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作，大力促进人的思想革命化。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，各级革命委员会，要以毛主席的最新指示为纲，大抓狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，针对群众在完成党中央提出的五项战斗任务中的活思想，大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。通过学习班，组织广大群众和干部活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，打倒无政府主义，打倒反革命经济主义，增强无产阶级党性，提高革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，坚定不移地带领群众按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和伟大战略部署，胜利前进。
