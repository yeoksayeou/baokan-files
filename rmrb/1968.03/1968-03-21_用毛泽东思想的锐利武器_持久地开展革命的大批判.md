The West Second Brigade of Xixiang Commune in Xin Yang County, Henan Province, has deeply carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasped class education, and closely combined the brigade's struggle, criticism, and reform with various tasks to carry out revolutionary criticism. This has promoted the thought revolutionization of the people and advanced the revolution and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Zhengzhou, the West Second Brigade of Xixiang Commune in Xin Yang County, Henan Province, has followed Chairman Mao's great teachings on peasants also criticizing the bourgeoisie, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and closely combining various tasks to persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, achieving good results. The brigade's revolutionary criticism has become increasingly profound, the number of participants has increased, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has become more extensive and profound, greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of the people, and advancing the revolution, production, and various tasks.

The main experiences of the West Second Brigade in carrying out revolutionary criticism are as follows:

First, deeply carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, continuously raise the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of commune members, and use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism.

Some commune members in this brigade initially had insufficient understanding of the significance of revolutionary criticism; some had low cultural levels and had difficulties in participating in revolutionary criticism. The brigade's leading cadre studied the active thoughts of the commune members. They said, "Comrade Lin Biao instructed us: 'Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country.' As long as we firmly grasp the masses' study and application of Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm every person's mind, no matter how many or how big the difficulties are, even if there is no culture or low culture, we can still carry out the revolutionary criticism well." They immediately organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organized commune members to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, recall and speak about the history of the Chinese revolution's victory relying on Mao Zedong Thought, mobilized the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses to list a large number of revolutionary struggle facts and their personal experiences, and praised that all past victories were achieved under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and were achieved relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This greatly inspired their deep proletarian feelings of infinite love, faith, reverence, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: In the past, we relied on Mao Zedong Thought to defeat the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, overthrow the landlords and rich peasants, and achieve agricultural collectivization. Today, we rely on this invincible treasure of Mao Zedong Thought to definitely carry out the revolutionary criticism well.

With the improvement of ideological awareness, the revolutionary criticism was carried out vigorously. The brigade has always insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to lead the revolutionary criticism. When formulating criticism topics and plans, they first formulated a study plan of Chairman Mao's works based on the criticism content; before each criticism meeting, they first read Chairman Mao's quotations; when summarizing the achievements and experiences of the revolutionary criticism, they first mobilized the masses to hold meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's works at the production team and brigade levels, continuously improving the level of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and the level of revolutionary criticism. They also organized Mao Zedong Thought study guidance groups to help elderly and female commune members with no culture to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, mastering the powerful ideological weapon of revolutionary criticism.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, with their deep proletarian feelings of infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with questions, insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and transform everything. The more they studied, the higher their political awareness, the clearer their direction and path, the stronger their class struggle consciousness, and the greater their momentum to criticize the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev. In the past three months, they have held 650 criticism meetings, and cadres and commune members have written 470 criticism articles.

Second, combine revolutionary criticism with class education, carry out extensive recall and comparison activities, and arouse the broad poor and lower-middle peasants' deep hatred towards the old society and the heinous crimes of the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and attempting to restore capitalism.

The leading cadre of this brigade believed that it is necessary to firmly grasp class education and continuously raise the commune members' awareness of class struggle and line struggle. Only by deeply hating the old society and China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line can the revolutionary criticism be carried out well and persistently. They followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," mobilized the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out extensive recall bitterness and compare sweetness activities, and insisted on carrying out mass class education movements. The specific methods are as follows:

1. At the beginning of each criticism topic, first combine the criticism content to carry out a class education of "four recalls and four comparisons." The content of "four recalls and four comparisons" is: recall the bitterness of the old society, compare the sweetness of the new society, and arouse the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to deeply hate the old society and infinitely love socialism; recall the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line, compare the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, raise the broad poor and lower-middle peasants' awareness of line struggle, deeply hate China's Khrushchev, infinitely love Chairman Mao, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao; recall the bitterness of individual farming, compare the sweetness of collectivization, make the broad poor and lower-middle peasants further clarify the direction and path, and firmly follow Chairman Mao to walk the socialist broad road; recall the bitterness of "self," compare the sweetness of "public," make the broad poor and lower-middle peasants hate and fight "self," love and establish "public," and further achieve thought revolutionization.

2. Throughout the entire criticism process, according to the criticism content and the active thoughts of the commune members, carry out recall bitterness and compare sweetness activities and class education in a timely manner.

3. The forms of class education are flexible and diverse, mainly adopting the "five combinations" method, that is, combining large-scale recall bitterness and compare sweetness with small-scale and family meetings; combining the history of the village and brigade with the history of the family and personal blood grudges; combining recall bitterness meals and recall bitterness plays with the exhibition of the history of the village, family, and personal blood grudges; combining typical recall bitterness and compare sweetness with mass recall bitterness and compare sweetness; combining the bitterness of the old society with the bitterness of suffering from China's Khrushchev promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the countryside after liberation.

4. Fully play the role of old poor peasants and the advantages of educated youth, organize young commune members to help old poor peasants study and apply Chairman Mao's works, raise their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and concentrate their hatred on the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party and their counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. At the same time, organize old poor peasants to tell the young commune members about the bitterness of being exploited and oppressed in the old society, raise the young people's class awareness and class struggle consciousness, and jointly criticize revisionism.

5. When summarizing the achievements and experiences of the revolutionary criticism, pay attention to summarizing the achievements and experiences of carrying out class education, continuously raise class education, and better insist on it.

Mass class education has strongly promoted the class awareness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. With their infinite love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and his agents, they regarded whether to carry out revolutionary criticism as a fundamental attitude and fundamental position of forgetting or not forgetting their roots, being revolutionary or not, and being loyal or not to Chairman Mao, and actively participated in the criticism of the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party.

Third, closely combine the brigade's struggle, criticism, and reform with various tasks to carry out criticism, achieving what is criticized and what is poisoned, criticizing and changing while inspiring fighting spirit.

In the early stage of carrying out revolutionary criticism, only the brigade and production team used the evening to carry out criticism. Later, they followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "human beings must continuously summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress," daringly created, and opened the battlefield of criticism in the fields, feeding rooms, sideline teams, dining places, and all other places. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants did not restrict the forms, closely combined the brigade's struggle, criticism, and reform with various tasks, criticized what they did, and criticized and poisoned what they criticized. The criticism meeting was only held at the beginning and end of each criticism topic, and the usual criticism was closely combined with the brigade's struggle, criticism, and reform and various tasks, using various fixed or relatively fixed professional teams, temporary production groups, and families as units, setting up the battlefield on the spot, and carrying out criticism at any time. In this way, the forms were flexible and diverse, closely combined with actual work, and effectively ensured that the revolutionary criticism was carried out extensively, profoundly, and persistently.

In the revolutionary criticism, this brigade, on the one hand, criticized fiercely, and on the other hand, dared to change, criticizing and improving while being swift and decisive. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants said, "After learning Mao Zedong Thought, we must use it; after criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist black goods, we must eliminate his poison." While thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms," they mobilized the masses to carry out the movement of learning from Dazhai, developing agricultural production. The broad commune members saw the new achievements of struggle, criticism, and reform, were greatly inspired, and further strengthened their determination to thoroughly carry out the revolutionary criticism well.

Currently, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres of this brigade are high-spiritedly holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implementing the five great battle tasks proposed in the New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and PLA Daily in 1968, determined to advance victoriously, more extensively, profoundly, and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, vowing to thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents, thoroughly eliminate all their poisons, comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    用毛泽东思想的锐利武器
    持久地开展革命的大批判
    河南沁阳县西向第二大队深入开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，狠抓阶级教育，紧密结合本单位的斗批改和各项任务开展革命大批判，促进了人的思想革命化，推动了革命和生产
    据新华社郑州电　河南省沁阳县西向公社西向第二大队遵照毛主席关于农民也要批判资产阶级的伟大教导，以毛泽东思想为武器，紧密结合各项任务，持久地开展革命大批判，收到了很好的效果。这个大队的革命大批判越来越深入，参加大批判的人越来越多，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动越来越广泛、深入，极大地促进了人的思想革命化，推动了革命、生产和各项工作。
    西向第二大队开展革命大批判的主要经验是：
    第一，深入开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，不断提高广大社员的社会主义觉悟，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入开展革命大批判。
    这个大队有些社员起初对革命大批判的意义认识不足；有的社员文化低，对参加革命大批判有畏难情绪。大队领导班子研究了社员群众中的活思想。他们说，林彪副主席指示我们：“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”只要狠抓群众活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装每一个人的头脑，不管困难再多、再大，就是没有文化或文化低，照样能搞好革命的大批判。他们立即大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，组织社员活学活用毛主席著作，大忆、大讲中国革命靠毛泽东思想取得胜利的斗争史，发动广大贫下中农和革命群众，列举大量革命斗争史实和自己的亲身经历，大颂过去的一切胜利都是在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想取得的，从而极大地激发了他们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情。贫下中农说：过去我们靠毛泽东思想打败了日本强盗、蒋匪帮，斗倒了地主、富农，实现了农业合作化，今天，我们靠毛泽东思想这个百战百胜的法宝，一定能搞好革命大批判。
    思想觉悟提高了，革命大批判轰轰烈烈地开展起来。大队始终坚持用毛泽东思想统帅革命的大批判。在订批判专题和批判计划时，首先根据批判内容，订出学习毛主席著作的计划；每一次批判会，都首先朗读毛主席语录；总结大批判的成绩、经验时，首先发动群众，以生产队和大队为单位召开活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，不断提高活学活用毛主席著作水平和革命大批判的水平。他们还组织了学习毛主席著作辅导小组，帮助没有文化的老年人和妇女社员活学活用毛主席著作，掌握革命大批判的强大思想武器。
    广大贫下中农和革命群众，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，坚持用毛泽东思想分析一切，改造一切。他们越学习，政治觉悟越高，方向、道路越明，阶级斗争的观念越强，批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的劲头越大。三个多月来，已开过批判会六百五十多次，干部、社员写批判文章四百七十多篇。　
    第二，结合革命大批判，坚持进行阶级教育，大搞忆比活动，激发广大贫下中农社员对旧社会，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派推行反革命修正主义路线、妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行的无比仇恨。
    这个大队的领导班子认为，必须紧紧抓住阶级教育，不断提高社员的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。对旧社会、对中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线恨得深，革命大批判才会搞得好，才能持久不懈地开展下去。他们遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，发动广大贫下中农大搞忆苦思甜活动，坚持开展群众性的阶级教育运动。具体做法是：
    一、在每个批判专题开始时，首先结合批判内容，搞一次“四忆四比”的阶级教育。“四忆四比”的内容是：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，激发广大贫下中农更加痛恨旧社会，无限热爱社会主义；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席革命路线的甜，提高广大贫下中农的路线斗争觉悟，无比仇视中国赫鲁晓夫，无限热爱毛主席，永远忠于毛主席；忆单干的苦，比集体化的甜，使广大贫下中农进一步明确方向、道路，坚定不移地跟着毛主席走社会主义康庄大道；忆“私”字的苦，比“公”字的甜，使广大贫下中农恨私斗私，爱公立公，进一步实现思想革命化。
    二、在整个大批判过程中，针对批判内容和结合社员中的活思想，有的放矢地随时随地地开展忆苦思甜活动，进行阶级教育。
    三、阶级教育的形式灵活多样，主要采取“五结合”的办法，即大会忆苦思甜和小会、家庭会忆苦思甜相结合；忆村史、队史和忆家史、个人血泪仇相结合；吃忆苦饭、演忆苦戏和村史、家史、个人血泪史展览相结合；典型忆苦思甜和群众性忆苦思甜相结合；忆旧社会的苦和诉解放后受中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行反革命修正主义路线的苦相结合。
    四、充分发挥老贫农的作用和知识青年的特长，组织青年社员帮助老贫农活学活用毛主席著作，提高他们的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟，把仇恨集中到党内最大的一小撮走资派和他们宣扬的反革命修正主义谬论上。同时，组织老贫农向青年社员一代讲在旧社会受剥削受压迫的苦，提高青年的阶级觉悟和阶级斗争观念，共同批判修正主义。
    五、在总结大批判的成绩、经验时，注意总结进行阶级教育的成绩与经验，把阶级教育不断提高，更好地坚持下去。
    群众性的阶级教育，有力地促进了广大贫下中农社员的阶级觉悟。他们怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的无比仇恨，把搞不搞革命大批判看作是忘本不忘本，革命不革命，忠不忠于毛主席的根本态度和根本立场问题，积极投入了对党内最大的一小撮走资派的大批判。
    第三，紧密结合本单位的斗批改和各项工作任务开展大批判，做到干啥批啥肃啥毒，边批边改鼓斗志。
    这个大队在开展革命大批判的初期，只是大队和生产队利用晚间进行大批判。后来，他们遵照毛主席“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的伟大教导，大胆创造，在田间地头、饲养室、副业组、吃饭场等一切场合，摆开了大批判的战场。广大贫下中农不拘形式，紧密结合本单位的斗批改和各项任务，干啥就批啥，批啥肃啥毒。批判大会只在每一个批判专题的开始和结束时开，经常的大批判，是紧密结合本单位的斗批改和各项任务，以各种固定的或比较固定的专业队、临时生产组和家庭为单位，就地摆战场，随时随地进行批判。这样，形式灵活多样，密切结合实际工作，有效地保证了革命大批判广泛、深入、持久地进行。
    这个大队在革命大批判中，一方面狠狠批，一方面大胆改，边批判，边改进，雷厉风行，立竿见影。广大贫下中农社员说，学了毛泽东思想，就要用；批了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货，就要肃清他的流毒。他们在彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义路线的同时，发动群众开展了学大寨的运动，发展了农业生产。广大社员看到斗批改的新成就，深受鼓舞，进一步增强了彻底搞好革命大批判的决心。
    目前，这个大队的广大贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，正高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论提出的五项伟大战斗任务，决心乘胜前进，更加广泛、深入、持久地开展革命大批判，誓把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人批深批透，彻底肃清其一切流毒，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。
