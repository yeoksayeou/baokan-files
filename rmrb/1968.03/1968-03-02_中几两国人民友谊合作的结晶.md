The tea factory and tea plantation in Massanta, built with Chinese aid in Guinea, held a grand completion ceremony on February 22 in Massanta. Guinea's President Sekou Toure and Tanzanian President Julius K. Nyerere, who was visiting Guinea at the time, attended the ceremony.

Also present were Guinea's Minister of Economic Development Ismail Toure, State Minister Diallo Seforaye, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Lansana Beavogui.

On this day, the entire city of Massanta was filled with a festive atmosphere. Thousands of workers, farmers, students, and residents, dressed in their finest, traveled from dozens of kilometers away to celebrate with Chinese technicians the completion of this symbol of Sino-Guinean friendship and cooperation—the first tea factory and tea plantation in Guinea.

President Toure invited Tanzanian President Nyerere to cut the ribbon for the completion of the tea factory and tea plantation. Afterwards, the two presidents, accompanied by Lin Bingnan, the acting charge d'affaires, toured the tea factory.

    中几两国人民友谊合作的结晶
    由中国援助几内亚兴建的马桑塔茶厂和茶园，二月二十二日在马桑塔举行隆重的落成仪式。几内亚总统塞古·杜尔和当时正在几内亚访问的坦桑尼亚总统朱利叶斯·克·尼雷尔出席了落成仪式。
    出席这次仪式的还有几内亚经济发展部长伊斯梅尔·杜尔、国务部长迪亚洛·塞福拉耶和外交部长兰萨纳·贝阿沃吉。
    这一天，马桑塔全城洋溢着欢乐的气氛。数以千计的工人、农民、学生和居民穿着节日的盛装，从几十公里外赶来同中国技术人员一道庆祝这一几中两国人民友谊合作的产物——几内亚的第一个茶厂和茶园的落成。
    杜尔总统邀请坦桑尼亚总统尼雷尔为茶厂和茶园的落成剪彩。随后，两位总统在林秉南临时代办的陪同下参观了茶厂。
