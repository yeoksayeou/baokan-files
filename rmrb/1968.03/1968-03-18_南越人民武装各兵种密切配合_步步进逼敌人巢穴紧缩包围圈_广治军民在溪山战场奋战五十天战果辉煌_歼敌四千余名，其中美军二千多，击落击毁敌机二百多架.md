	South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces Coordinate Closely, Step by Step Advancing to Besiege the Enemy's Nest, Tightening the Encircling Circle
	The Military and Civilians of Quang Tri Fight Bravely for Fifty Days on the Khe Sanh Battlefield, Achieving Brilliant Results
	Over 4,000 Enemy Soldiers Annihilated, Including More Than 2,000 American Soldiers, Over 200 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down or Destroyed

	HANOI, March 17 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, from January 21 to March 13, the military and civilians of the northern region of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam fought bravely for fifty days on the Khe Sanh battlefield, achieving brilliant results. They annihilated over 4,120 enemy soldiers, including 2,580 American invaders, and shot down or destroyed 218 enemy aircraft.

	The Khe Sanh base in the northern region of Quang Tri Province, west of Highway 9, includes the Da Krong stronghold, the Xom Hoa military support area, and the Lang Vei outpost. It is an important base in the enemy's Highway 9 defense line, with over 7,000 enemy troops, including 6,000 American Marines.

	The report said that the military and civilians of the northern region of Quang Tri Province responded to the call for the winter-spring offensive by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Since the beginning of this year, they have continuously and fiercely attacked the enemy, inflicting heavy blows on the American puppet forces stationed in the Khe Sanh area.

	On January 21, the People's Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on the enemy in the Khe Sanh area, capturing the Xom Hoa military support area, annihilating three puppet army battalions, liberating the town of Xom Hoa and most of the surrounding areas, and freeing 10,000 people. At the same time, they cleared all the enemy's "strategic hamlets" in the northwestern region of Quang Tri Province and broke through the enemy's defensive line to the southeast of the Khe Sanh area.

	In the early hours of February 6 and 7, while the American aggressors were panicking due to the fierce attacks by the military and civilians of South Vietnam, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Tri Province delivered a thunderous blow to the enemy. After three hours of fierce fighting, they completely captured the Lang Vei outpost, annihilating and capturing nearly 1,000 enemy soldiers, seizing all their weapons, and gaining complete control of the battlefield. The People's Liberation Armed Forces completely controlled a 45-kilometer-long road passing near the Khe Sanh base, isolating the Da Krong stronghold on the west side of Highway 9.

	Since February, the artillery of the People's Liberation Armed Forces has been relentlessly shelling the American invaders day and night, tightening the encirclement of various enemy strongholds in the Khe Sanh area. Sometimes, the artillery of the People's Liberation Armed Forces would shell the enemy ten times a day, forcing the American aggressors to hide in underground shelters and fortifications all day.

	During the more than fifty days of encirclement, the artillery, anti-aircraft artillery units, and infantry of the People's Liberation Armed Forces closely coordinated, annihilating 1,960 enemy soldiers in the Khe Sanh stronghold and shooting down or destroying 218 enemy aircraft. The infantry steadily tightened the encirclement, step by step approaching the enemy's nest, intercepting enemy patrols and engineers at the barbed wire, or annihilating the enemy inside the base. Many soldiers became "brave warriors" in the battles. In the various battles around the Da Krong stronghold alone, the infantry units of the People's Liberation Armed Forces annihilated over 860 American puppet soldiers.

	Currently, the People's Liberation Armed Forces are steadily tightening the encirclement of the American Marines in the Khe Sanh area, digging trenches outside the barbed wire of the Khe Sanh base. The enemy is forced to hide in fortifications day and night, daring not to leave the base. The enemy's land supply lines are also under the control of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, and the airport is frequently shelled. The enemy troops in various strongholds can only rely on airdrops for ammunition and food. The American aggressors, in an attempt to salvage their failure on the Highway 9 battlefield, are resorting to all means, including the use of B-52 bombers to bomb the Khe Sanh area day and night, in order to hold onto the Khe Sanh base. However, under the fierce offensive of the military and civilians of the northern region of Quang Tri Province, all the American aggressors' tactics cannot break through the iron encirclement of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, and they cannot escape the predicament of the American puppet forces on the Khe Sanh battlefield.

　　南越人民武装各兵种密切配合　步步进逼敌人巢穴紧缩包围圈
　　广治军民在溪山战场奋战五十天战果辉煌
　　歼敌四千余名，其中美军二千多，击落击毁敌机二百多架
    新华社河内十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方广治省北部地区军民，从一月二十一日到三月十三日在溪山战场连续英勇奋战五十个昼夜，建立了辉煌的战功，消灭敌军四千一百二十多名，其中包括美国侵略军二千五百八十名，击落击毁敌机二百一十八架。
    广治省北部九号公路以西的溪山基地，包括达根据点、香化军事支区和卫村据点。它是敌人九号公路防线中的一个重要基地，驻有敌人七千多名，其中有美国海军陆战队六千名。
    报道说，广治省北部地区军民，响应越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的冬春季战斗号召，从今年初春以来连续和猛烈地打击敌人，给盘踞在溪山地区的美伪军以极其沉重的打击。
    一月二十一日，人民解放武装力量猛烈进攻溪山地区敌军，攻克了敌人香化军事支区，歼灭伪军三个连，解放了香化县城，和香化县周围大部分地区，使一万人民获得解放。同时，还扫清了广治省西北地区的全部敌人“战略村”，冲破了溪山地区东南面的防线。
    二月六日夜间和七日凌晨，正当美国强盗面对着越南南方军民猛烈进攻而感到惊惶失措的时候，广治省人民解放武装力量给予敌人以雷霆万钧般的打击，经过三个小时的英勇战斗，完全攻克了卫村据点，消灭和俘虏敌人近一千名，缴获全部武器，完全掌握战场上的控制权。人民解放武装力量完全控制了经过溪山基地附近的长达四十五公里的公路，使达根据点被完全孤立在九号公路的西面。
    自二月份以来，人民解放武装力量炮兵日以继夜地轰击美国侵略军，并紧缩对溪山地区各据点的包围。有时，人民解放武装力量的炮兵一天轰击成十次，使美国强盗整天地龟缩在地下室和工事里。
    在包围敌人的五十多天中，人民解放武装力量的炮兵、高射炮部队同步兵紧密配合，消灭溪山据点的敌人一千九百六十名，击落击毁敌机二百一十八架。步兵日益缩紧包围圈，步步逼近敌人的巢穴，在铁丝网边截击敌人的巡逻队和工兵，或者消灭基地里的敌人。许多战士在战斗中成为“歼美勇士”。仅在达根据点周围的各次战斗中，人民解放武装力量步兵的各个分队就消灭美伪军八百六十多名。
    目前，人民解放武装力量日益缩紧对溪山地区美国海军陆战队的包围圈，已经把战壕挖到溪山基地的铁丝网外边，敌人被打得整天整夜地龟缩在工事里，不敢走出基地。敌人的陆上运输线也处于人民解放武装力量的控制下，机场不断遭到轰击，各据点的敌军只能靠飞机空投弹药和粮食。美国强盗妄图挽救它在九号公路战场上的失败，不择一切手段，其中包括使用B—52型轰炸机对溪山地区进行日以继夜的轰炸，以便保住溪山基地。但是，在广治省北部地区军民暴风骤雨般的攻势下，美国强盗的各种手段都不能冲破人民解放武装力量的钢铁包围圈，都无法摆脱美伪军在溪山战场上的困境。
