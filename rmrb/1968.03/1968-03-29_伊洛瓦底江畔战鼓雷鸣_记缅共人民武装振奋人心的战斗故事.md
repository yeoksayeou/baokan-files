The radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought
Guides the world's people in the right direction.
Firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought,
The world's proletarians take up arms.
Victorious in battle, invincible in attack,
The boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought.

This is a song praising the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, that is popular among the revolutionary people of Burma. Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a people's revolutionary war is unfolding in the vast rural areas of Burma.

The people's armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party actively apply Chairman Mao's military thoughts. Despite being at a disadvantage in numbers and equipment, they wage flexible guerrilla warfare, annihilate the enemy's combat forces, seize the enemy's weapons, and grow stronger. Relying on the support of the masses, they bravely and wisely strike the enemy, achieving many brilliant victories.

A daring raid on the enemy's stronghold opens the map of Burma. Between the cities of Pyay and Kyauktaw in the southern region of Dala, there is a small town called Yeywa. Not far from the opposite bank of this town is the famous Yedana Zayat tin mine in all of Burma.

Once, the Pyay County people's armed forces intercepted a reactionary government car on their way to the Yedana Zayat tin mine. They then drove the car straight to the police station in the mining area. At that time, there were twelve enemies in the station. The people's armed forces launched a surprise attack with superior forces, annihilating the defenders in just five minutes and capturing eight of them.

After occupying the tin mine, the people's armed forces, with the help of the worker comrades, gathered intelligence on the enemy and launched a night raid on the Yeywa town police station, capturing the deputy mayor and deputy chief on the spot. Subsequently, the people's armed forces forced the enemy to surrender without firing a single shot, capturing nineteen prisoners and seizing twenty-one guns.

After occupying Yeywa town, the police station chief and some policemen who had gone out returned by motorboat from Pyay. The people's armed forces took advantage of the favorable terrain, ordering the enemy to surrender their weapons, but the policemen put up a stubborn resistance. At this point, the people's armed forces attacked from both sides, firing fiercely, and annihilated this enemy force.

In three battles, the people's armed forces paid the price of only one lightly wounded, capturing thirty-seven enemies and seizing thirty-eight guns and over 1,500 rounds of ammunition.

The people's armed forces controlled the Yedana Zayat tin mine and Yeywa town for six days. During this period, they held mass rallies, propagated the policies of the Burmese Communist Party, and exposed the crimes of imperialism and the Ne Win reactionary clique. They distributed the resources seized from the people by the reactionary government to the poor masses in the surrounding villages. After educating the prisoners, they released them. A brilliant ambush

The Burmese people's armed forces, relying on the support of the masses, displayed the characteristics of guerrilla warfare, concentrated as many forces as possible, and took secret and swift actions to launch surprise attacks on the enemy.

At the beginning of last year, the Burmese reactionary government dispatched several special battalions to attack the revolutionary base area in the Bago Mountains. On the Yangon-Mandalay highway between East Dagon and Pyinmana, enemy military vehicles passed through every day. A local elderly farmer, out of hatred for the Burmese reactionary government, pointed out a favorable location for ambushing enemy military vehicles to the people's armed forces. This place is close to both sides of the highway, with forests and ditches, making it very suitable for ambushes.

The people's armed forces hurried to this place overnight and set up the ambush circle at 3 AM. Despite hunger and fatigue, they patiently waited for the enemy's military vehicles. Until noon, four military vehicles loaded with enemy soldiers and police indeed arrived. The first military vehicle entered the ambush circle, and the enemies on it were annihilated. The enemies on the second military vehicle were also mostly annihilated within the ambush circle, with only three escaping. The remaining two vehicles of enemies were blocked outside the ambush circle and fled in disarray.

In this ambush battle, the people's armed forces annihilated two enemy platoons on the enemy's transportation line, seizing a batch of weapons and ammunition.

After the battle, the enemy sent reinforcements to counterattack, firing over a hundred artillery shells at the ambush area. At this time, the people's armed forces, who had already moved to a safe area, were very excited, laughing about how the so-called elite troops equipped with American weapons were also paper tigers. Displaying heroism on the transportation line

The Burmese people's armed forces attack the enemy's railways, highways, and water transportation lines everywhere in Burma.

The people's armed forces in the Irrawaddy Delta region frequently attack enemy ships. This armed force, after the rectification movement and studying Chairman Mao's works, had an even stronger fighting spirit and decided to attack a relatively large enemy ship, the "Daw Myat."

On October 4 of last year, the people's armed forces mobilized three motorboats from the masses, ambushing the enemy ship's route. At noon, the "Daw Myat" discovered something amiss as it approached the people's armed forces' ambush circle and turned around to flee. The three motorboats driven by the people's armed forces, with full power, chased after it. The enemy ship, when it reached near an enemy outpost, did not have time to dock and rushed towards the shore in a panic. The guards on the ship abandoned it and fled, while the enemy on the shore fired fiercely at the people's armed forces, trying to prevent them from approaching. Under the enemy's fire, the people's armed forces fearlessly fought and approached the enemy ship, using ropes to pull it back. The people's armed forces, with great courage and strong revolutionary will, fought with the enemy for over an hour, finally seizing the enemy ship. On the way back, the masses on both banks of the river came out to cheer and applaud the people's armed forces, celebrating the glorious victory of their sons!

The victories of the Burmese people's armed forces greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and crushed the arrogance of the reactionary forces. Under the radiant guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the people's revolutionary armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party will surely become stronger with each battle and achieve even more glorious victories.

    伊洛瓦底江畔战鼓雷鸣
    ——记缅共人民武装振奋人心的战斗故事
    毛泽东思想光辉灿烂的阳光，
    给世界人民指引方向。
    紧紧掌握毛泽东思想，
    世界无产者拿起刀枪。
    战必胜、攻必克，
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想。
    这是在缅甸革命人民中流传的一首歌颂世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲。在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指引下，一场人民革命战争正在缅甸广大农村地区发展。
    缅甸共产党领导的人民武装，活学活用毛主席的军事思想，在数量和装备处于优势的敌人面前，开展机动灵活的游击战，歼灭敌人的有生力量，夺取敌人的武器，来发展壮大自己。他们依靠群众的支持，勇敢机智地打击敌人，创造了许多光辉的战绩。奇袭敌人据点翻开缅甸地图，在南部德林达依的卑市和戈东市之间，有一个小镇叫礼雅，该镇对岸不远的地方，就是全缅闻名的耶达那崩锡矿。
    有一次，卑县人民武装在向耶达那崩锡矿进军途中，在公路上截住了反动政府的一辆汽车，然后乘着汽车直奔矿区的警察哨所。当时这个哨所里有十二个敌人。人民武装以优势兵力发动突然袭击，只用五分钟的时间，全歼守敌，活捉了八名。
    占领锡矿之后，人民武装在工人弟兄的帮助下，摸清敌情，又连夜奇袭礼雅镇警察哨所，当场逮捕了副镇长和副所长。随后，人民武装不费一枪一弹迫使敌人投降，抓到十九个俘虏，缴获二十一支枪。
    人民武装占领礼雅镇后，外出的敌人警察哨所所长和一些警察乘着汽船从卑市返回。人民武装利用有利地形，勒令敌人交枪，但警察负隅顽抗。这时，人民武装两边夹攻，猛烈射击，全部消灭了这股敌人。
    三次战斗，人民武装只付出轻伤一人的代价，俘敌三十七人，缴获枪三十八支和子弹一千五百多发。
    人民武装控制着耶达那崩锡矿和礼雅镇六天。这期间，他们召开群众大会，宣传缅甸共产党的政策，揭露帝国主义和奈温反动派的罪行。他们把反动政府从老百姓那里搜刮来的物资，分发给附近村庄的贫苦群众。对俘虏进行教育后予以释放。出色的伏击战缅甸人民武装，依靠群众的支持，发挥游击战争的特长，集中可能多的兵力，采取秘密和神速的行动，出其不意地袭击敌人。
    去年初，缅甸反动政府派出一些特别营向勃固山区革命根据地发动进攻，在仰光—曼德勒公路上的东坞到彪镇之间，每天有敌人的军车来往。当地一个老农民出于对缅甸反动政府的仇恨，给人民武装指引了一个伏击敌人军车的有利地形。这里紧靠公路两侧，有树林和河沟，十分便于埋伏。
    人民武装连夜赶到这个地方，在凌晨三时设好了埋伏圈。他们不顾饥饿和疲劳，耐心地等待着敌人军车的到来。直到中午十二时，果然有四辆军车，满载敌人军警开来了。第一辆军车进入伏击圈后，车上的敌人遭到全歼。第二辆军车上的敌人也在伏击圈内被歼大半，只有三人跑掉。其余两车敌人被阻击在伏击圈外，狼狈逃去。
    人民武装在这次伏击战中，在敌人的交通要道，歼灭敌军两个排，缴获一批枪支和弹药。
    战斗结束后，敌人派来援兵进行反扑，向伏击圈地区发射一百多发炮弹。这时，已经转移到安全地区的人民武装，非常兴奋，笑谈敌人用美式武器装备起来的所谓精锐部队，也是纸老虎。交通线上逞英豪
    缅甸人民武装，在全缅各地到处袭击敌人的铁路、公路和水上运输线。
    渺?县人民武装在伊洛瓦底江三角洲地区，经常袭击敌人的轮船。这支人民武装经过整风运动，学习了毛主席著作，战斗意志更加旺盛，决定袭击敌人一只较大的轮船“多最”号。
    去年十月四日，人民武装动员了群众的三艘机动船，埋伏在敌船的航道上。中午十二时，“多最”号在开近人民武装埋伏圈时，发现情况不妙，掉头就跑。人民武装驾驶的三艘机动船，开足了马力，尾随猛追。敌船逃到接近一个敌军哨站时，来不及靠岸，就慌忙向岸边冲去。船上护航的警卫弃船逃命，岸上的敌军猛烈向人民武装射击，企图阻止人民武装靠近。在敌人的火力下，人民武装毫不畏惧，一边打，一边冲近敌船，用绳索拴住它往回拉。人民武装战士以大无畏的精神和坚强的革命意志，同敌军激战一个多小时，终于缴获了这艘敌船。在凯旋途中，沿河两岸群众都跑出来向人民武装鼓掌欢呼，祝贺子弟兵的光辉胜利！
    缅甸人民武装的胜利，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了反动派的威风。在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，缅甸共产党领导的人民革命武装必将越战越强，夺取更加辉煌的胜利。（新华社）
