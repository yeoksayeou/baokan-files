In the midst of the call to victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the leadership of the Chengdu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army recently held a provincial agricultural production work conference. The conference called on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres throughout the province to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further carry out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," summon up greater efforts, strive to be in the forefront, and swiftly launch a spring production high tide. This is to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a bumper harvest in 1968, creating new achievements.

This conference, with the theme of "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism," seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions and the New Year's Day editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. It also took Dazhai as an example to review and summarize the experiences and problems of last year's efforts to combine revolution with production. The representatives at the meeting unanimously agreed that the current situation in Sichuan Province is excellent, not just good, but getting better and better. Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is deeply rooted in people's hearts. The pace of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination has been significantly accelerated. Mao Zedong Thought study classes organized in various places across the province are becoming more and more numerous and better and better. Based on last year's good harvests of grain, cotton, sugarcane, hemp, flue-cured tobacco, and cocoons, this year's winter crops have also achieved good results in field management and basic farmland construction, and the number of pigs has increased compared to the same period last year. Everyone agreed that all these achievements are the results of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The representatives expressed that at present, we must further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly criticize and repudiate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois selfishness, strengthen proletarian party spirit, further develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and make new contributions to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In discussing this year's agricultural production tasks, some comrades initially felt that there were too many tasks in rural work and were unsure of what to focus on. After studying and discussing, the representatives unanimously agreed that among many tasks, the fundamental one is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions. Politics is the command and the soul. Arming the peasant masses throughout the province with Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental and important task on the agricultural front. Only with the greatest determination and the fastest speed, can we thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide production, carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminate the revisionist poison spread by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Sichuan's countryside, and promote the thought revolutionization of the people, so as to make agricultural production leap forward.

The representatives, through summarizing and exchanging advanced experiences, further criticized the erroneous view of opposing revolution to production. The representatives pointed out that the facts have proven that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces. The boundless revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants ignited by the Cultural Revolution will definitely be reflected in production. The conference, with the spirit of summoning up greater efforts and striving to be in the forefront, formulated and implemented the provincial agricultural production targets for this year, focusing on grain production, diversified operations, and comprehensive development. The representatives expressed that they would definitely, like Dazhai, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, always, everywhere, and in all matters study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and swiftly launch a magnificent spring production high tide across the province's countryside.

    迅速让毛主席的最新指示在四川农村落实
    鼓足干劲力争上游立即掀起春耕生产高潮
    四川省革筹小组和驻军领导机关召开农业生产工作会议
    新华社成都二十三日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军号中，四川省革命委员会筹备小组和人民解放军成都部队领导机关，最近召开了全省农业生产工作会议。会议号召全省广大贫下中农和农村基层干部，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，进一步贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，鼓足干劲，力争上游，迅速掀起春耕生产高潮，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，夺取一九六八年农业生产全面大丰收而立新功。
    这次会议以“斗私，批修”为纲，认真学习了毛主席的一系列极为重要的最新指示，学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论，并且以大寨为榜样，检查和总结了去年抓革命促生产的经验和问题。到会代表一致认为，当前四川全省的形势大好，不是小好，而且越来越好。毛泽东思想大普及，毛主席的革命路线更加深入人心。革命大联合、革命三结合的步伐大大加快。全省各地举办的毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好。全省在去年粮食、棉花、甘蔗、麻类、烤烟、蚕茧等都获得较好收成的基础上，今年小春作物的田间管理和农田基本建设也作出了成绩，生猪也比去年同期有所增加。大家认为，所有这些成就，都是贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的光辉成果。代表们表示，当前一定要进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，进一步发展革命大联合和革命三结合，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利做出新贡献。
    在讨论今年的农业生产任务时，开始有的同志感到农村工作头绪多，任务重，到底该抓什么，心里没有数。代表们经过学习、讨论，一致认为，千头万绪抓根本，根本就是活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示。政治是统帅，是灵魂。用毛泽东思想武装全省农民群众，是农业战线最根本、最重要的任务。只有以最大的决心，最快的速度，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，深入开展革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其在四川的代理人在农村散布的修正主义流毒，促进人的思想革命化，才能使农业生产突飞猛进。
    到会代表通过总结和交流先进经验，进一步批判了那种把革命和生产对立起来的错误观点。代表们指出，事实证明，无产阶级文化大革命是发展生产力的强大推动力。广大贫下中农在文化大革命中激发出来的冲天革命干劲，一定会在生产上表现出来。会议本着鼓足干劲，力争上游的革命精神，制定并落实了全省今年以粮为纲、多种经营、全面发展的农业生产指标。代表们表示，一定要象大寨那样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，时时、事事、处处活学活用毛泽东思想，在全省农村迅速掀起轰轰烈烈的春耕生产高潮。
