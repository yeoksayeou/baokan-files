In the face of the deepening political and economic crisis of imperialism, the imperialist system is accelerating its collapse. Recently, the capitalist world has witnessed the most severe and profound financial crisis in forty years. Concurrently, the domestic economies of various imperialist countries are fraught with danger and shrouded in crisis. This not only severely limits the room for maneuver of the imperialist countries led by the United States in dealing with the financial crisis but also, as the financial crisis develops further, may accelerate the outbreak of the long-brewing production overcapacity crisis in these countries. The spokesmen of the monopoly capitalist groups in various imperialist countries and their mouthpieces are generally concerned about the gloomy prospect of the financial crisis intertwining with the production overcapacity crisis. They watch with despair as an economic crisis similar to the one that engulfed the entire capitalist world from 1929 to 1933 appears to be approaching.

The United States' industrial production has stagnated, and the economy is "unfavorable."

The United States, which has been hit hardest by the current Western financial crisis, has seen its industrial production clearly stagnate. A series of important industrial sectors saw production decline last year; among them, the so-called "pillar" of the U.S. economy, the automobile and steel industries, saw their annual output decrease by 13.8% and 6% respectively compared to 1966. The situation this year is no better, with the industrial production index for the first two months lower than that of December last year.

What particularly unsettles the U.S. monopoly capitalists is that the new orders in the industrial sector in January this year were significantly lower than in December last year; among them, new orders in the durable goods industry decreased by 7.1% from the previous month, the steepest decline in eleven years; new orders in the machine tool industry dropped to the lowest level in four years. The "unfavorable" situation in orders presages a further decline in U.S. industrial production this year. The situation indicates that despite the U.S. monopoly capitalists' attempts to "stimulate" the economy with hundreds of billions of dollars in Vietnam War orders, they still cannot reverse the trend of stagnation or decline in overall U.S. industry due to difficulties in sales. At the same time, as the capitalist world market shrinks and the economic situation worsens in various imperialist countries, the competition for export markets is becoming increasingly fierce, and U.S. goods are facing greater obstacles in foreign sales.

Due to the slow growth of exports compared to imports, U.S. foreign trade is deteriorating. Although the U.S. export volume last year was still higher than the import volume, the surplus was the lowest since 1960. This trend has further developed this year, with the foreign trade surplus for the first two months, if annualized, being only half of last year's. This is another heavy blow to the U.S. ruling class, which has long relied on foreign trade surpluses to offset part of the international payments deficit. According to the latest estimates by Paris sources, the U.S. international payments deficit for the first quarter of this year may reach 20 billion dollars; if annualized, the full-year deficit will set a record of 80 billion dollars, doubling last year's figure. This will inevitably further accelerate the collapse of the dollar's position, making the situation of U.S. imperialism, which is under the onslaught of the financial crisis, even more precarious.

The British economy is deteriorating rapidly, and the situation is dire.

As British imperialism accelerates its decline, British industrial production, which has been stagnant for many years, again stagnated and even declined in 1967. The situation in many important industrial sectors is worsening year by year, with steel production down 11.5% from 1965. The automobile manufacturing industry is even worse: car production has dropped to its lowest level since 1962, commercial vehicles have decreased by 13% compared to 1966, the lowest since 1959. Coal and textile industries are also reducing production; while machinery manufacturing and shipbuilding industries are in a state of stagnation.

At the same time as production stagnates and declines, investment is also decreasing. According to the British Board of Trade's estimate on March 1, British industrial investment last year was down 3% from the previous year, and in the fourth quarter alone, it decreased by 7%. This situation has made the British bourgeoisie particularly anxious, as the decline in investment presages an even darker future for British industrial production.

To avoid losses caused by difficulties in industrial production and to squeeze out the maximum profit, British capitalists are competing to sacrifice workers, leading to a serious deterioration in unemployment. According to official figures, the number of unemployed in Britain throughout 1967 remained at around 500,000 to 600,000, nearly double the number of unemployed in the first half of 1966, and the severe unemployment situation in Northern Ireland is not included in these statistics. These capitalists are also vying to raise prices and lower workers' wages. According to British newspaper reports, especially after the devaluation of the pound in November last year, prices have soared, with more than 3,000 items seeing price increases.

Meanwhile, the tool of British monopoly capital—the Labour government—has taken severe measures to prolong the life of the pound. However, these measures not only failed to save the pound from its fate of collapsing internationally but also accelerated the deterioration of Britain's economic ills, making the danger of Britain's financial and economic crises converging and breaking out more imminent. As the financial crisis in the capitalist world develops further, the capitalist world market may fall into great chaos, and countries like the United States, the main imperialist powers, will inevitably take measures to shift the crisis onto their neighbors in a bid to avoid being swallowed by the crisis wave. In such a fierce battle, the ailing British economy will be utterly defeated and unable to recover.

The French economy is stagnant, and the situation is grim.

France, which is vying with the United States in various fields, is also in a dire economic situation.

Last year, France's industrial production was the worst since the partial economic crisis in Western European countries in 1959. During this year, French monopoly capital, in an attempt to shift difficulties onto the people, saw the number of unemployed reach its highest level in more than twenty years, and prices rose to their most rapid pace since France implemented austerity measures in 1963.

Throughout last year, French industrial production stagnated for a long period, and it was only in the last few months that it was artificially "stimulated" by government spending and other measures. However, the overall industrial production for the year increased by only 2.2%, less than half the average growth rate from 1959 to 1966. France's main emerging industrial sector—the automobile industry—saw a 2% decrease in production; steel production has stagnated for four consecutive years, and metal smelting, coal, and most consumer goods industries saw a decline in production. It is estimated that France's industrial production in the first half of this year will not see much improvement. The French government was forced to announce on January 24 a series of artificial measures, injecting approximately 3 billion francs, to further "stimulate" production.

The main reason for the stagnation in industrial production is the declining purchasing power of the French working people, the shrinking domestic market, and the increasingly fierce competition in the foreign market among imperialist countries. According to statistics, the domestic sales volume of French industrial products last year was not only lower than the previous year but also lower than in 1965. France's trade deficit with its main trading partners—the non-Franc zone countries—last year reached more than 52 billion francs, an increase of more than 7 billion francs from the previous year. Currently, due to the devaluation of the pound, the United States' measures to rescue the dollar at the expense of others, and the complete elimination of tariffs among the six "Common Market" countries, France's foreign trade is facing even more intense competition.

Under these circumstances, the French monopoly groups' attempts to "stimulate" production by increasing government spending will not only have little effect but will also expand France's budget deficit. Last year, France's budget deficit had already increased to 72 billion francs, declaring the failure of France's austerity plan announced a few years ago. Therefore, the French monopoly groups are anxious about France's economic prospects.

West Germany's production is declining, and the future is bleak.

West Germany, which has long been considered to have an "economic power" position in the Western world, is also facing a worsening economic situation, with industrial production declining absolutely last year, and the situation in January this year indicating that it will face an even more perilous year.

In 1967, various important industrial sectors in West Germany saw stagnation and reduced production. Despite the Bonn government's adoption of measures such as "advancing purchasing power" and other artificial means in an attempt to stimulate production and delay the arrival of the crisis, the total industrial production for the year still declined absolutely compared to 1966, a situation not seen since 1949. Last year, West Germany's coal, shipbuilding, machinery manufacturing, and consumer goods industries all saw worsening conditions, and in the so-called "prosperous" economy of West Germany, the two industrial sectors of construction and automobile manufacturing, which occupy an important position, saw a sharp decline in production, dealing a heavy blow to the entire West German economy.

Due to capitalists desperately shifting the losses from declining production, the unemployment situation has become increasingly severe. According to Western media reports, since the autumn of 1966, nearly a million workers have been laid off by capitalists; among them, the number of unemployed workers in West Germany has more than doubled, reaching over 520,000, and another approximately 350,000 unemployed foreign workers have been forced to leave West Germany.

As unemployment surges, prices continue to rise, and the purchasing power of the working people continues to decline, further exacerbating the shrinkage of the domestic market. This is clearly reflected in the significant decline in the sales volume of wholesale and retail businesses, with January this year seeing a decline of 24.9% and 41% respectively compared to the previous month. As the competition for markets among imperialist countries intensifies, West Germany's foreign trade is deteriorating, and due to the U.S. government's adoption of a series of "emergency measures" to rescue the dollar, West Germany's foreign trade, which is closely related to the United States, will face even more severe blows.

Faced with this situation, West German monopoly capital is trying to shift the losses caused by economic deterioration onto the working people through various means such as reducing wages and increasing taxes, thereby greatly exacerbating class contradictions within West Germany.

The capitalist system is on its last legs and accelerating its collapse.

As the economies of major imperialist countries such as the United States and Britain continue to deteriorate, other capitalist countries in Western Europe are also seeing industrial production stagnation, increasing unemployment, and worsening inflation.

For example, Belgium's main industrial sectors—coal mining and metallurgy—have been in a state of crisis for years, with many enterprises already closed; many small and medium-sized enterprises in Sweden have gone bankrupt; Finland's unemployment rate has also reached its highest level in recent years. In countries such as Spain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Luxembourg, inflation is particularly severe, and industrial production is more stagnant. As the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world flourish and the overall political and economic crisis of capitalism deepens, the economies of imperialist countries, which are already riddled with holes, will further wither and collapse. No matter how hard the imperialists led by the United States struggle, they cannot escape the fate of economic crisis. As the great teacher of the world proletariat, Chairman Mao, has taught: "We are now in an era when the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse, and the imperialists have fallen into an insoluble crisis."

    金融危机山雨袭来　生产危机阴云密布
    帝国主义制度加速走向全面崩溃
    在帝国主义政治经济总危机不断深化，帝国主义制度加速走向全面崩溃的情况下，资本主义世界最近爆发了四十年来最严重、最深刻的金融危机；与此同时，各帝国主义国家的国内经济普遍险象环生、危机阴云密布。这就不仅使以美国为首的帝国主义国家应付金融危机的余地大受限制，而且，随着金融危机的进一步发展，很可能使这些国家内酝酿已久的生产过剩危机加速爆发。帝国主义各国垄断资本集团的代言人及其喉舌普遍对金融危机可能与生产过剩危机相互交织的阴暗前景表示严重忧虑，他们怀着绝望的心情注视着一场类似一九二九——一九三三年波及整个资本主义世界的经济大危机正在到来。
    美国工业生产停滞，经济“不景气”
    在当前西方金融危机中受到最沉重打击的美国，工业生产已经陷入了明显的停滞，一系列重要的工业部门的生产在去年出现了明显下降；其中号称美国经济“重要支柱”的汽车工业和钢铁工业的全年产量，比一九六六年分别下降了百分之十三点八和百分之六。今年以来，情况依然不妙，头两个月的工业生产指数低于去年十二月份的水平。
    特别引起美国垄断集团不安的是，今年一月份工业部门的新订货比去年十二月明显下降；其中，耐用品工业的新订货比前一月减少了百分之七点一，这是十一年来最猛烈的下降；机床工业的新订货降到了四年来的最低水平。订货情况的“不景气”预示着美国的工业生产在今年内还将进一步下降。情况表明，尽管美国垄断资本集团用成百亿美元的侵越战争订货进行“刺激”，但仍然不能扭转整个美国工业因销路困难而出现的生产停滞或下降的趋势。同时，由于资本主义世界市场越来越小，经济情况普遍恶化的各帝国主义国家争夺出口市场的斗争日益尖锐，美国商品在国外的销售遭到了越来越大的阻力。
    由于出口的增长速度赶不上进口的增长，美国的对外贸易每况愈下。去年美国的出口额虽然仍然大于进口额，但顺差却是一九六○年以来最低的一年。今年以来这种趋势又有进一步的发展，头两个月的对外贸易顺差，如折合年率计算，只及去年的一半。这对一向依靠外贸顺差来弥补一部分国际收支赤字的美国统治集团来说，又是沉重的一棒。据巴黎人士的最新估计，今年第一季度美国的国际收支赤字可能高达二十亿美元；如折合年率计算，全年赤字将创造八十亿美元的最高纪录，比去年又增加一倍。这势必进一步加速美元地位的垮台，使得处在金融危机风暴袭击下的美帝国主义处境更加险恶。
    英国经济加速恶化，险象环生
    随着英帝国主义的加速衰亡，多年来踏步不前的英国工业生产，在一九六七年又一次停滞，甚至下降。不少重要工业部门的情况一年不如一年，炼钢工业的产量比一九六五年低百分之十一点五。汽车制造业的情况更糟：小汽车的产量降到一九六二年以来的最低水平，商用车辆比一九六六年减产百分之十三，为一九五九年以来的最低点。煤炭和纺织工业也纷纷减产；而机器制造和造船工业的生产则陷于停滞状态。
    在生产停滞和下降的同时，投资也在下降。据英国贸易部三月一日的估计数字，英国去年全年的工业投资比前年下降百分之三，而在去年第四季度一个季度里甚至下降了百分之七。这种情况使得英国资产阶级特别焦急，因为投资的下降预示着英国工业生产前景更加黯淡。
    为了避免由于工业生产困难而造成的损失，并榨取最大的利润，英国的资本家争先恐后地以工人作牺牲品，使失业现象严重恶化。根据官方数字，一九六七年全年英国的失业人数始终保持在五六十万左右，比一九六六年上半年的失业人数差不多增加一倍，而失业现象特别严重的北爱尔兰的统计数字还不包括在内。这些资本家还竞相抬高物价，压低职工的工资。据英国报纸报道，特别是在去年十一月英镑贬值后，物价扶摇直上，涨价的物品达三千种以上。
    与此同时，英国垄断资本的工具——工党政府为了使英镑苟延残喘，曾经多次采取向人民开刀的严酷措施。但是，这些措施不但没能挽救英镑国际地位垮台的厄运，反而加速了英国经济痼疾的恶化，使得英国的财政金融危机和经济危机交集并发的危险更加迫近。随着资本主义世界金融危机的进一步发展，资本主义世界市场很可能发生大混乱，而美国等主要帝国主义国家为使自己不致被危机的浪潮所吞没，就必然会争相采取以邻为壑的措施，千方百计互相转嫁危机。在这样一场大混战中，老朽的英国经济将一败涂地，一蹶不振。
    法国经济踏步不前，情况不妙
    正在各个领域里同美国争霸的法国，经济情况也不妙。
    去年法国的工业生产是一九五九年西欧国家普遍发生局部性经济危机以来最糟的。在这一年中，法国垄断资本为了向人民转嫁困难，使失业人数达到二十多年来的最高峰，使物价上涨到一九六三年法国采取紧缩通货的措施以来最猛烈的程度。
    去年内法国工业生产长期停滞，到最后几个月，靠政府扩大开支等办法，才人为地“刺激”起来。但是全年合计，工业生产只增加百分之二点二，不到一九五九年至一九六六年期间平均增长率的一半。法国主要新兴工业部门——汽车工业去年减产百分之二；钢产量连续四年踏步不前，金属冶炼、煤和大部分消费品工业，去年产量都下降。据估计，法国今年上半年的工业生产不会有很大起色。法国政府被迫在一月二十四日宣布采取一系列人为措施，再投入约三十亿法郎资金，以进一步“刺激”生产。
    工业生产停滞的主要原因，是法国劳动人民购买力日益下降，国内市场萎缩，而国外市场上帝国主义国家之间的竞争又日益剧烈。据统计，去年法国工业产品国内销售额不仅低于前年，而且低于一九六五年。法国同它的主要贸易对手——非法郎区国家的贸易，去年逆差达五十二亿多法郎，比前年增加了七亿多法郎。目前，由于英镑贬值、美国为抢救美元进一步采取损人利己的措施以及六国“共同市场”集团即将完全取消对成员国的关税，法国对外贸易正面临更激烈的竞争。
    在这种情况下，法国垄断集团用增加政府支出来“刺激”生产，这就不仅不可能产生多大效果，反而扩大了法国政府的预算赤字。去年法国的预算赤字实际上已经增加到七十二亿法郎，这就宣告了法国几年前公布的紧缩通货计划实际上已经垮台。因此，法国垄断集团对法国经济前景惶惶不安。
    西德生产下降，前途凶多吉少
    一向在西方世界被认为具有经济“实力”地位的西德，经济状况同样毫不例外地越来越坏，继去年工业生产绝对下降之后，今年一月份的情况预示，今年它将面临一个更为艰险的年头。
      一九六七年，西德各个重要工业部门纷纷滞销减产。尽管波恩政府采取了“预支购买力”等许多人为措施，妄图刺激生产，延缓危机的到来，但是仍然出现了全年工业生产总值比一九六六年绝对下降的情况，这是西德自一九四九年以来所未有的。去年，西德的煤炭、造船、机器制造和消费品工业的生产都不断恶化，而在西德的所谓经济“繁荣”中占有重要地位的建筑和汽车制造这两个工业部门的生产，更出现了大幅度的猛烈下降，使西德整个经济遭到沉重打击。
    由于资本家拚命转嫁生产下降的损失，使失业情况越来越严重。据西方报刊材料，自从一九六六年秋天以来，已经有将近一百万工人被资本家解雇；其中，西德本国的失业工人增加了一倍多，达到五十二万多人，另外还有约三十五万名外籍失业工人被迫离开了西德。
    在失业猛增的同时，物价不断上涨，劳动人民的购买力不断降低，从而加剧了国内市场的萎缩。这明显地反映在批发和零售商业的销售额大幅度降低，今年一月比上一个月分别降低了百分之二十四点九和百分之四十一。而随着帝国主义各国间市场争夺战的加剧，西德的对外贸易每况愈下，而由于美国政府为了抢救美元采取了一系列“紧急措施”，同美国关系十分密切的西德对外贸易势将受到更严重的打击。
    面临着这种情况，西德垄断资本正在通过变相削减工资、增加税收等办法，千方百计地把经济恶化造成的损失转嫁给劳动人民，从而大大加剧了西德国内的阶级矛盾。
    资本主义制度日暮途穷，加速崩溃
    在美英等主要帝国主义国家经济日益恶化的同时，西欧其他一些资本主义国家也纷纷出现了工业生产停滞、失业人数增加，通货膨胀加剧等情况。
    例如，比利时的主要工业部门——采煤业和冶金业，近年来一直处于危机状态，不少企业已经关闭；瑞典许多中小企业相继倒闭；芬兰的失业人数目前也达到了近年来的最高数字。在西班牙、荷兰、瑞士、卢森堡等国，通货膨胀特别严重。工业生产更加停滞。随着世界人民革命斗争的蓬勃高涨和资本主义政治经济总危机不断深化，帝国主义各国早已百孔千疮的经济，必将进一步凋零和崩溃。不管以美国为首的帝国主义怎样挣扎，他们都无法逃避经济危机的厄运。正如世界无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席所教导的：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。　（据新华社）
