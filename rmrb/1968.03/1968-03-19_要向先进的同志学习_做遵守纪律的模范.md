The labor discipline at the Coal Mining Team 1 of the Kongji Coal Mine in Huainan became lax under the influence of anarchist thinking. Later, with the help of the PLA's leftist support troops, there was significant improvement in labor discipline and production efficiency. However, after a short period, some people began to waver again. Some saw that certain teams did not adhere to the three-shift system and felt that their own team was at a disadvantage. Others, seeing that their tardiness was less than others, took a lenient attitude towards their own tardiness, saying things like, "Compared to others, I'm not so bad."

Compare what? With whom? Obviously, if this issue is not clarified, the struggle against anarchism will be half-hearted. At this time, the PLA comrades organized the workers to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works, the "Three Articles." Through the study, everyone understood that: comparison needs a standard, if the standard is wrong, right and wrong cannot be distinguished. The standard that revolutionary workers should use for comparison is Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune. Compared to them, what we do is not "good enough," but far from sufficient. We should also compare with our colleagues at work, but we should compare with those advanced comrades who insist on combining revolution with production. If we do not compare with the advanced, but only align with the backward, this "comparison" is actually an excuse for our anarchist behavior. If we continue to "compare" in this way, we will go further and further down the wrong path of anarchism.

This study not only helped everyone distinguish right from wrong but also further mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers. By overturning anarchism, everyone strives to be at the forefront, and the situation of combining revolution with production is getting better and better. Since this year, the entire team has completed the coal production tasks ahead of schedule every month.

　　要向先进的同志学习  做遵守纪律的模范
    淮南孔集煤矿采煤一队在无政府主义思潮影响下，劳动纪律一度出现过松弛现象。后来，在解放军支左部队的帮助下，劳动纪律和生产效率等方面都有了较大的好转。但时间不长，又有人动摇起来，有的人看到个别队没有坚持三班制，认为自己队吃了亏；有的人看到自己迟到的时间比别人少，对自己的迟到行为就采取原谅态度，还说什么“和人家比一比，我还不错。”
    比什么？和谁比？显然，这个问题不弄清，反对无政府主义的斗争就会半途而废。这时，解放军同志就组织职工学习了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”。通过学习，大家明确了：比，需要一个标尺，比的尺子错了，是非就搞不清。革命职工用来作为比较的标尺，只能是张思德、白求恩。和他们比，我们每个人做的都不是“差不多”，而是差得很多很多。和周围一起工作的同志也应该比，但要和那些坚持抓革命促生产的好同志比。不和先进的比，光向个别落后的看齐，这样“比”，实际是替自己的无政府主义行为辩护。这样“比”下去，就会使自己在无政府主义邪路上越走越远。
    这次学习，不但帮助大家辨明了是非，同时也进一步调动了广大革命职工的积极性。反掉了无政府主义，人人争上游，抓革命促生产的形势越来越好。今年以来，全队月月超额完成煤炭生产任务。
