The third session of the Stude and Apply Mao Zedong Thought Active Participants' Conference of the Shenyang Military Region successfully concluded. The conference called on all comrades to take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, adapt to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 25 - Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, amidst the victorious songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the third session of the Study and Apply Mao Zedong Thought Active Participants' Conference of the People's Liberation Army Shenyang Military Region successfully concluded on March 17. During the more than 20-day conference, nearly 3,000 representatives deeply studied the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, extensively exchanged experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, and promoting the ideological transformation of the people. The conference held that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has pushed the revolutionary construction of our army to a new stage. The new situation requires us to prioritize raising the awareness of cadres and soldiers in the struggle between the two lines. Ideological transformation is the embodiment of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's "loyalty." Loyalty to Chairman Mao requires a high level of awareness in the struggle between the two lines and a high level of awareness in continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, consciously executing and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The conference called on all members to take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, adapt to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao is a shining example of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, the greatest banner-bearer leading the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation to scale the peaks of Mao Zedong Thought, and has made outstanding contributions to opening a new era of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought for the Chinese people and the people of the world. To promote ideological transformation, one must, like Comrade Lin Biao, internalize Mao Zedong Thought as one's soul, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The conference held that to promote ideological transformation and raise awareness of the struggle between the two lines, the most fundamental thing is to continuously deepen one's proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao and strive to learn Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, methods, and principles on continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. Deep proletarian feelings of infinite love, infinite faith, infinite admiration, and infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao are the concentrated embodiment of high awareness in the struggle between the two lines and the fundamental driving force for promoting ideological transformation. The report "Bravely Defend the Right to Study Mao Zedong Thought" by the "Model Red Ninth Company" in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought gave the representatives a profound education in the struggle between the two lines. The comrades of the Red Ninth Company, with their infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, bravely fought against the bourgeois military line promoted by the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and steadfastly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The representatives believed that one must have a full understanding of the long-term and complex nature of class struggle under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not handled properly, capitalist restoration is possible at any time." "Be extremely vigilant and never relax." The class struggle under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship is prominently and concentratedly reflected in the struggle between the two lines within the Party. Therefore, without awareness of the struggle between the two lines, one cannot handle the class struggle under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. We must continuously strengthen the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, maintain a firm and correct political direction and a clear mind in the face of storms and waves, see clearly, stand firmly, and withstand the pressure. We must always remember class struggle, always remember proletarian dictatorship, always emphasize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The conference held that to promote ideological transformation and raise awareness of the struggle between the two lines, one must experience storms and see the world in the midst of mass struggles; one must persist in carrying out revolutionary criticism and education on the struggle between the two lines. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the midst of mass struggles and grow in the tempering of revolutionary storms and waves." Comrades participating in the "Three Supports and Two Militaries" must, in the midst of class struggle storms and waves, persist in emphasizing proletarian politics and promoting their own ideological transformation. Units not participating in the "Three Supports and Two Militaries" must also, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, prioritize raising awareness of the struggle between the two lines in promoting ideological transformation. Practice has proven that, in the army, deeply carrying out great praise for the great leader Chairman Mao and great criticism of China's Khrushchev is an extremely important content and an extremely effective method for raising awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

In the future, continuous efforts must be made to carry out revolutionary criticism and small rectification movements, combining them with the actual thoughts of the army, and promoting ideological transformation in the process of criticizing revisionism and linking it with self-criticism.

The conference held that to promote ideological transformation and raise awareness of the struggle between the two lines, one must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought with the problems of the struggle between the two lines in mind, carry forward the spirit of self-revolution, and thoroughly transform one's worldview. Studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought must emphasize the word "apply." Applying to others and to oneself must emphasize applying to oneself; applying to improving work and transforming thoughts must emphasize transforming thoughts; applying to minor issues and major issues must emphasize major issues. Many units have achieved remarkable results by using the method of finding problems in the struggle between the two lines, finding causes in one's worldview, finding answers in Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions, and judging effectiveness by actions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party within the Fourth Red Army exists with various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the execution of the Party's correct line." The representatives felt that only by criticizing and transforming one's worldview can one truly understand and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, eliminate interference from the right or ultra-"left," and bravely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

To criticize and transform one's worldview, one must study and apply the "Three Articles" thoroughly. The representatives believed that the "Three Articles" are line articles, and thoroughly studying and applying the "Three Articles" means studying and applying them to execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; it means using them to solve problems in the struggle between the two lines, making one's thoughts fully conform to the requirements of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With awareness of the struggle between the two lines, one has great public spirit and can stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the fierce struggle between the two classes. The representatives said: Studying and applying the "Three Articles" as line articles makes them always new and always effective.

The conference held that to promote the ideological transformation of the army and raise the army's awareness of the struggle between the two lines, the leadership cadre must be strictly managed. The leadership cadre is the power. Only by promoting the ideological transformation of the leadership cadre and raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines can the ideological transformation of the army be promoted, and soldiers with high awareness of the struggle between the two lines be cultivated. Only by building the Party committee into a leadership cadre that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao can an army that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao be led. The representatives believed that leading cadres must, like leading the troops in charging forward in the past, take the lead in realizing ideological transformation, criticize and transform the "self," establish the "public," and thoroughly change one's worldview. Truly achieving eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao, eternal loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The 3,000 representatives, with profound proletarian feelings of infinite love, infinite faith, infinite admiration, and infinite loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, sent a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao.

Comrade Chen XiLian, Commander of the Shenyang Military Region, made a report titled "Infinitely Loyal to Chairman Mao, Infinitely Loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, Infinitely Loyal to Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line" at the conference. Comrade Zeng ShaoShan, Political Commissar, made an important speech at the opening ceremony. (Accompanied by pictures)

The Party Committee of a certain regiment in the Shenyang Military Region insisted on going to the masses to criticize and transform the "self," carrying out self-revolution. This is them holding a Mao Zedong Thought study class with soldiers participating, listening to soldiers' opinions on Party Committee members.

    活学活用毛泽东思想提高路线斗争觉悟  做无限忠于毛主席革命路线的坚强战士
    沈阳部队第三次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会胜利闭幕。大会号召全体同志以林副主席为光辉榜样，适应无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，真正把毛泽东思想学到手
    新华社沈阳二十五日电　在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，人民解放军沈阳部队第三次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会，于三月十七日胜利闭幕。在历时二十多天的大会上，近三千名代表深入地学习了伟大导师毛主席的最新指示，广泛地交流了活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，搞好人的思想革命化的经验。会议认为，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把我军的革命化建设推向了一个新的阶段。新的形势，要求我们必须把提高干部战士对两条路线斗争的觉悟放在首要地位。思想革命化就是无限忠于毛主席的“忠”字化。忠于毛主席，必须有高度的对两条路线斗争的觉悟，高度的在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的觉悟，自觉地执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    大会号召全体成员要以林副主席为光辉榜样，适应无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，真正把毛泽东思想学到手。林副主席是活学活用毛泽东思想的光辉典范，是率领全党、全军、全国攀登毛泽东思想高峰的最伟大的旗手，他为开创中国人民和世界革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想的新纪元作出了卓越的贡献。搞好思想革命化，就要象林副主席那样，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    会议认为，搞好思想革命化，提高对两条路线斗争的觉悟，最根本的是要不断加深对伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级感情，努力学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情，是对两条路线斗争觉悟高的集中体现，是搞好思想革命化的根本动力。“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”在会上作的《勇敢地捍卫学习毛泽东思想的大权》的报告，使代表们受到了一次深刻的两条路线斗争的教育。红九连的同志们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限忠诚，勇敢地同反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的资产阶级军事路线进行斗争，始终坚定不移地活学活用毛主席著作，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    代表们认为，对于无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争的长期性、复杂性，必须有充分的认识。毛主席教导我们：“革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。”“千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，突出地集中地表现在党内的两条路线斗争。因此，没有对两条路线斗争的觉悟，就搞不好无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争。我们一定要不断加强两条路线斗争的观念，在大风大浪中永远保持坚定正确的政治方向和清醒的头脑，看得清，站得稳，顶得住。我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    会议认为，要搞好思想革命化，提高对两条路线斗争的觉悟，就必须在群众斗争中经风雨，见世面；必须坚持开展革命大批判，搞好两条路线斗争教育。毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”参加“三支”“两军”的同志，要在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，坚持突出无产阶级政治，抓好自身的思想革命化。没有参加“三支”“两军”的部队，同样必须以毛主席的最新指示为纲，把提高对两条路线斗争的觉悟放在搞好思想革命化的首位。实践证明：在部队中深入地开展对伟大领袖毛主席的大颂扬，对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判，是提高对两条路线斗争觉悟的非常重要的内容和非常有效的方法。
    今后要持续不断地开展下去，要从部队的思想实际出发，把革命大批判和小整风结合起来，在批修中自觉联系斗私，促进思想革命化。
    会议认为，搞好思想革命化，提高对两条路线斗争的觉悟，一定要带着两条路线斗争中的问题活学活用毛泽东思想，发扬自我革命精神，彻底改造世界观。活学活用毛泽东思想，一定要突出用字。用于别人和用于自己，一定要突出用于自己；用于改进工作和用于改造思想，一定要突出用于改造思想；用于抓小节和用于抓大节，一定要突出用于抓大节。许多部队学习毛泽东思想采用的从两条路线斗争中找问题，从世界观上找原因，从毛主席著作和毛主席最新指示中找答案，从行动看效果的方法，取得了显著成效。
    毛主席教导我们：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。”代表们体会到：斗私，批修，改造世界观，才能真正理解和贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能排除来自右的或极“左”的方面的干扰，英勇地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    破私立公改造世界观，要狠学狠用“老三篇”。代表们认为，“老三篇”是路线篇，狠学狠用“老三篇”，就是要为执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而学，为执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而用；就是要用来解决两条路线斗争中的问题，使自己的思想完全符合毛主席无产阶级革命路线的要求。有了对两条路线斗争的觉悟，就是有了大公，就能在两个阶级的激烈斗争中，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。代表们说：把“老三篇”作为路线篇来学，来用，就常用常新，常用常灵。
    会议认为，搞好部队的思想革命化，提高部队对两条路线斗争的觉悟，首先必须狠抓领导班子。领导班子就是政权。只有搞好领导班子的思想革命化，把领导班子对两条路线斗争的觉悟提得高高的，才能搞好部队的思想革命化，培养具有两条路线斗争高度觉悟的战士。只有把党委建设成为无限忠于毛主席的领导班子，才能带出无限忠于毛主席的部队。代表们认为，领导干部一定要象当年带领部队冲锋陷阵那样，冲在前边，带头实现思想革命化，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，搞臭个人主义和一切剥削阶级观念，彻底改造世界观。真正做到永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    大会三千名代表怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情，向毛主席发了致敬电。
    沈阳部队司令员陈锡联同志在大会上做了《无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线》的报告，政治委员曾绍山同志在开幕式上做了重要讲话。（附图片）
