The armed revolutionary struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party has entered a new stage.

BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China today sent a congratulatory message to the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party to warmly celebrate the 20th anniversary of the armed revolutionary struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party. The full text of the message is as follows:

To Chairman Thakin Than Tun of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party:

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people warmly celebrate the 20th anniversary of the armed revolutionary struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party.

Over the past 20 years, the various nationalities of Burma, under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, have relied on their own strength to wage a long, arduous, and unyielding struggle. The red flag of the people's revolutionary armed struggle has always flown high in Burma. This is a great victory for the various nationalities of Burma and a great victory for the combination of Marxism-Leninism with Burmese conditions.

At present, the situation of the revolutionary armed struggle in Burma is excellent. Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Thakin Than Tun, the Burmese Communist Party has adhered to the proletarian revolutionary line of "winning the war and seizing power," using revolutionary armed forces to oppose counter-revolutionary armed forces. You have learned from war, insisted on self-reliance, firmly relied on the people, carried out land struggles, expanded revolutionary base areas and revolutionary armed forces, and united the revolutionary armed forces of various nationalities. You have repeatedly smashed the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression," pushing the people's revolutionary armed struggle in Burma into a new stage. The victory of the Burmese people's armed struggle is a heavy blow to imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys, and a major support for the Vietnamese people who are fighting against the U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Communist Party of China is convinced that the Burmese Communist Party, which combines the invincible Marxism-Leninism with Burmese conditions, will definitely lead the various nationalities of Burma to defeat U.S. imperialism and its agent in Burma, the Ne Win reactionary clique, as well as the Soviet modern revisionists who are helping the U.S., and achieve the final victory in the armed revolutionary struggle.

Under the personal initiation and leadership of Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has thoroughly smashed the evil plot of Chinese Khrushchev and his gang to restore capitalism, consolidating the proletarian dictatorship in our country. This is of great significance not only to the Chinese people but also, in a certain sense, to the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world.

The protracted armed revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people will surely win!

    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，巩固了中国的无产阶级专政。这不仅对中国人民具有伟大的意义，对于全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争在某一方面也将具有一定的意义
    新华社二十八日讯　中国共产党中央委员会今天致电缅甸共产党中央委员会，热烈祝贺缅甸共产党领导的革命武装斗争二十周年。贺电全文如下：缅甸共产党中央委员会主席德钦丹东同志：
    中国共产党和中国人民热烈祝贺缅甸共产党领导的革命武装斗争二十周年。
    二十年来，缅甸各族人民，在缅甸共产党领导下，依靠自己的力量，进行了长期艰苦卓绝的斗争。人民革命武装斗争的红旗始终飘扬在缅甸上空。这是缅甸各族人民的伟大胜利，是马克思列宁主义与缅甸情况相结合的伟大胜利。
    目前，缅甸革命武装斗争形势大好。缅甸共产党在以德钦丹东同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，坚持了“赢得战争，夺取政权”的无产阶级革命路线，用革命的武装反对反革命武装。你们从战争学习战争，坚持自力更生，坚决依靠人民，开展土地斗争，扩大革命根据地和革命武装力量，并团结各族的革命武装，一次又一次地粉碎了敌人的反革命“围剿”，把缅甸人民的革命武装斗争推向了一个崭新的阶段。缅甸人民武装斗争的胜利，是对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的沉重打击，对坚持抗美救国战争的越南人民的重大支持。中国共产党坚信，用战无不胜的马克思列宁主义与缅甸情况相结合的缅甸共产党，一定能够领导缅甸各族人民，战胜美帝国主义及其在缅甸的代理人——奈温反动集团，以及美帝帮凶苏联现代修正主义，赢得革命武装斗争的最后胜利。
    我们在毛主席亲自发动和领导下的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，巩固了我国的无产阶级专政。这不仅对中国人民具有伟大的意义，对于全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争在某一方面也将具有一定的意义。
    缅甸人民的持久的革命武装斗争必胜！
                    中国共产党中央委员会
                            一九六八年三月二十八日
