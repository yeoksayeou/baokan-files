Early March saw another wave of gold-buying in Western Europe. In markets like London, Paris, and Zurich, people rushed to exchange dollars and pounds for gold. The U.S. and British imperialists, in an attempt to rescue their currencies, continued to lose large amounts of their gold reserves. After the devaluation of the pound, the dollar, already in a precarious position, faced even greater uncertainty.

The Dollar's Fall from Grace

Before this wave, rumors spread in Western Europe that the U.S. government would ban gold exports starting in April and devalue the dollar. As a result, people hurried to exchange their dollars for gold. This gold-buying rush reflects the growing distrust in the capitalist world towards the dollar.

After World War II, U.S. imperialism became the hegemon of the capitalist world, and the dollar became the cornerstone of the capitalist monetary system. Many countries used the dollar for international settlements and as foreign exchange reserves. U.S. imperialism exploited its hegemony to issue large amounts of dollars, using various means such as foreign aid, private investment, credit, and trade to expand politically, economically, and militarily abroad. Domestically, it used methods like increasing government spending, issuing paper money, and expanding credit consumption (installment payments, mortgage loans) to stimulate the U.S. economy through inflation, creating a false prosperity. However, this approach eventually backfired. On one hand, the massive export of dollars led to years of huge trade deficits, causing foreigners to hold more dollars and increasingly demand gold in exchange, leading to a significant loss of U.S. gold reserves. On the other hand, the domestic inflation policy caused the dollar's value to plummet, severely weakening domestic purchasing power and reducing the competitiveness of U.S. exports. This further shook confidence in the dollar.

Johnson's Futile Efforts

Since the beginning of this year, the Johnson administration has taken a series of emergency measures domestically and internationally to stabilize the dollar, but these efforts have encountered insurmountable difficulties both at home and abroad.

Johnson's "emergency measures" aimed to curb domestic inflation through tax increases, reduce the trade deficit, and urge other major capitalist countries to use their gold reserves to help maintain the dollar's shaky position. However, given the increasingly unfavorable situation facing U.S. imperialism, Johnson's measures have faced significant obstacles.

Domestically, the escalation of the Vietnam War has increased government spending, especially military expenditures, making it difficult to reduce the budget deficit and control inflation. The Johnson administration, to balance the budget and protect the dollar's credibility, repeatedly urged Congress to quickly pass a bill increasing income tax by 10%. However, due to strong domestic opposition to tax increases, the U.S. Congress has yet to pass this bill.

Internationally, Johnson's plan to stabilize the dollar by shifting the burden to other countries has also faced resistance. Led by France, Western European countries have taken various measures to counter the U.S. France's Finance Minister Debré openly declared, "France's efforts are aimed at preventing the implementation of these measures." The U.S. requested West Germany to purchase $10 billion in U.S. military equipment and securities, but West Germany only reluctantly agreed to buy $5 billion. Britain canceled its order for U.S. F-111 fighter jets, reducing U.S. revenue by $1 billion over the next few years. The U.S. is now pushing for the early implementation of the "special drawing rights" agreed upon by the International Monetary Fund last year, aiming to establish a $100 billion "settlement reserve" over five years to strengthen measures to cope with the dollar crisis.

Due to the U.S. intention to use this "reserve" to maintain the dollar and pound as "world currencies," it has faced opposition from France. It seems that this plan will not be easily realized.

The Hegemon's Position on the Brink of Collapse

Recently, the Johnson administration requested that Congress approve the use of the portion of the gold reserve supporting the domestic dollar to cope with the foreign gold redemption crisis. Despite this, the U.S. gold reserve is still far from sufficient to meet the redemption demands. Additionally, gold continues to flow out, with a reduction of over $60 million in January. In January, the U.S. trade surplus was half of the monthly average of the previous year, contrary to Johnson's subjective desire to expand the trade surplus. Therefore, when rumors spread in Western Europe that the U.S. would ban gold exports starting in April, the gold-buying rush followed. The pound, closely linked to the dollar, also suffered a blow, falling to its lowest point since the devaluation. To stop the gold-buying rush, the U.S. recently joined forces with West Germany, Switzerland, and other "gold pool" member countries to issue a statement guaranteeing the gold price. However, this has not weakened the momentum of the gold-buying rush. As the dollar crisis deepens, U.S. and British imperialism will face even greater difficulties.

The dollar crisis is an inherent contradiction of the imperialist system, a manifestation of the increasing decay of U.S. imperialism. No matter what measures Johnson takes, he cannot change the objective laws of historical development.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The imperialist system is riddled with contradictions that cannot be overcome, plunging the imperialists into great anguish."

The severe dollar crisis reflects the weakening of U.S. power under the heavy blows of revolutionary people worldwide, as well as the serious political and economic crises facing the entire capitalist world. The development of the dollar crisis will plunge the capitalist world's financial and monetary system into greater chaos, greatly exacerbating the contradictions between the U.S. and other imperialist countries, and further sharpening class contradictions within the U.S. and the entire capitalist world. Under the more intense revolutionary storm sweeping the world, the imperialist system will more quickly head towards total collapse.

### 西欧抢购黄金风潮和美元危机

    西欧抢购黄金风潮和美元危机
    三月初以来，西欧又刮起了抢购黄金的风潮。在伦敦、巴黎和苏黎世等黄金市场上，人们纷纷抛出美元、英镑，购进黄金。美英帝国主义为了抢救它们的货币，继续流失大量黄金储备。英镑贬值以后，处境困难的美元，再次处于风雨飘摇、朝不保夕的地位。
    美元地位一落千丈
    这次风潮发生前夕，西欧盛传美国政府将从四月份起禁止黄金出口并实行美元贬值。因而人们就纷纷抛掉手里的美元，换成黄金。这次抢购黄金的风潮，反映了资本主义世界对于美元越来越强烈的不信任。
    第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义成了资本主义世界的霸主，美元也就成了资本主义世界货币金融体系中的台柱，许多国家都拿美元进行国际清算和作为外汇储备。美帝国主义利用它的霸主地位，大量发行美元，在国外通过对外“援助”、私人投资、信贷、贸易等途径，进行政治、经济和军事扩张；在国内则通过大量增加政府开支、滥发纸币、扩大信贷消费（分期付款、抵押贷款）等办法，用通货膨胀来刺激美国经济，制造虚假繁荣。但是，美帝国主义的这种做法，终于走向了自己的反面。一方面，大量的美元输出造成连年的巨额国际收支逆差，使外国人手里的美元越来越多，并且不断向美国要求兑换黄金，从而造成了美国库存黄金的大量流失；另一方面，国内执行通货膨胀政策的结果，也造成了美元实际价值的急剧下跌，大大削弱了国内人民的购买力，并且使美国货的出口竞争能力为之减弱。这就进一步加剧了对美元信用的动摇。
    约翰逊回天乏术
    从今年年初以来，约翰逊政府为了稳定美元，在国内外采取了一系列抢救措施，想了许多应急办法。
    约翰逊所采取的“紧急措施”，就是想一方面通过增税来阻止国内的通货膨胀，同时设法减少国际收支逆差，并且竭力要求其他主要资本主义国家用它们的黄金储备，帮助美国维持住岌岌可危的美元地位。但是，在美帝国主义今天面临着对它越来越不利的形势下，约翰逊政府的措施和办法，在国内外都遇到不可克服的困难。
    在美国国内，侵越战争的“升级”，使政府开支，特别是军费开支更加增大，预算赤字更难压缩，通货膨胀趋势已越来越无法遏制。约翰逊政府为平衡财政，保护美元信用，一再要求国会火速通过增加所得税百分之十的法案。但是，由于国内人民强烈反对增税，美国国会至今未敢通过这一法案。
    在国外，约翰逊政府为稳定美元地位而把美国的困难转嫁给其他国家的计划，也遭到抵制。以法国为代表的西欧国家，采取各种办法对美国进行反击。法国财政部长德勃雷公开宣布，“法国的全部努力在于避免（美国）这些措施的实行”。美国要西德购买十亿美元的美国军火和证券，西德只勉强答应购买五亿美元。英国取消了对美国F—111型战斗机的订货，使美国在今后几年内减少了十亿美元的收入。美国现在又要求提前实施“国际货币基金组织”去年达成协议的“特别提款权”，要这个组织建立一笔为期五年、数达一百亿美元的“清偿储备”，来加强应付美元危机的手段。
    由于美国想利用这项“储备”来保持美元以及英镑的“世界货币”地位，因此遭到了法国的反对。看来美国的这一个如意算盘也不是容易实现的。
    霸主地位濒于垮台
    不久以前，约翰逊政府要求美国国会同意把支持国内美元的那部分黄金储备移用于应付国外挤兑黄金的风潮。尽管这样，美国的黄金储备还是远远不足以应付兑换的要求。加上黄金继续流失，一月份又减少了六千多万美元。一月份美国的贸易顺差比去年每月平均少了一半，与约翰逊扩大贸易顺差的主观愿望背道而驰。因此，当西欧传出美国将在四月份起禁止黄金出口的风声，抢购黄金的风潮就随之而起。同美元有密切联系的英镑，跟着也遭到冲击，使英镑价格跌落到了英镑贬值以后的最低点。美国为了遏止抢购黄金的风潮，最近再次联合西德、瑞士等“黄金总库”的六个成员国，于十日发表声明保证黄金价格不变。但是，这依然未能减弱抢购黄金风潮的势头。随着美元危机的更进一步发展，美英帝国主义都将陷入更加困难的境地。
    美元危机是帝国主义制度本身的固有矛盾所造成的，是美帝国主义日益腐朽衰落的表现。约翰逊不管采取什么办法，也改变不了历史发展的客观规律。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服，使帝国主义者陷入了极大的苦闷中。”
    美元的严重危机，反映了在全世界革命人民沉重打击下美帝的力量日益削弱，也反映了整个资本主义世界所面临的严重的政治和经济危机。美元危机的发展，将使资本主义世界的金融货币制度陷入更大的混乱，大大加剧美帝同其他帝国主义国家之间的矛盾，同时使美国国内和整个资本主义世界的阶级矛盾更加尖锐化。在更加高涨的席卷全世界的革命风暴的猛烈冲击下，帝国主义制度将更快地走向全面崩溃。
