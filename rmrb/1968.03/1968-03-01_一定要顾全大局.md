Workers at the Third Steel Plant in Anshan, a major steel production base in China, have, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support units, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have launched a campaign to suppress the anarchist tendencies that hinder the revolution and affect production, achieving great victories. Many revolutionary workers have written articles, shared their thoughts, and discussed their experiences. Some of these have been selected and edited for publication, along with a foreword written by three veteran steelworkers from Anshan Steel Plant: Guo Yaozhong, Li Zhenxiang, and Liu Xiguang.

In my revolutionary practice, I have come to realize that we must overcome anarchism and cultivate a sense of considering the overall situation. Only then can we all think and act in unison, and only then can the production of open-hearth furnaces present a lively scene.

The three shifts on our open-hearth furnace have, through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, overcome the phenomenon of leaving as soon as the shift ends and each doing their own thing. Instead, we have seen the emergence of a new spirit of communist cooperation where one person's problem is everyone's problem, and one shift's difficulty is everyone's difficulty.

One day, as we were about to end our shift, we heard that Shift B suddenly had four or five people absent due to illness, making it difficult to complete the production tasks. Faced with this unexpected problem, what should we do? Everyone immediately gathered around, and after studying Chairman Mao's teaching on "considering the overall situation," everyone gave up the idea of going home after the shift. One after another, they volunteered, "Leave me behind!" "Shift B's difficulties are our difficulties; we must consider the overall situation." Everyone's cooperative spirit was high, and in the end, the leadership decided, considering the next day's production, to leave only one person from our shift to support the next shift.

To strengthen the unity and cooperation among the three shifts, we have also used Mao Zedong Thought to ensure smooth shift handovers, creating favorable production conditions for the next shift. By doing so, we have significantly reduced the steelmaking time. On February 5, we produced three furnaces of steel in one day, setting a new record for fast steelmaking in large open-hearth furnaces. These events have made me deeply realize that by arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, keeping the overall situation in mind, anarchist tendencies will have no room to infiltrate, and both revolution and production will achieve new successes.

    一定要顾全大局
    第三炼钢厂二十一号平炉丙班炉长　张教生
    新华社鞍山二十九日电　我国钢铁工业基地——鞍钢的广大革命职工，在解放军支左部队帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席的最新指示，对障碍革命、影响生产的无政府主义思潮展开围剿，取得了巨大的胜利。许多革命职工挥笔写文章，谈感想，讲体会。现在，从中挑选整理一部分发表，并由鞍钢炼铁厂郭尧忠、李振堂和刘锡贵三位炼铁老工人写了个前言。
    在革命实践中我体会到：必须打倒无政府主义，树立起顾全大局的思想，才能使大家心往一处想，劲往一处使，平炉生产才能呈现一派热气腾腾的景象。
    我们平炉上的三个班，通过活学活用毛主席著作，克服了那种下班就走，生产上各敲各的鼓，各打各的锣的现象，出现了一人有事全班帮，一班有难各班助的共产主义大协作的新风尚。
    有一天，我们正准备下班，听说乙班一下子因病缺勤四五个人，生产任务很难完成。面临这样一个突如其来的问题，怎么办？大家立刻围拢来，学习了毛主席“要提倡顾全大局”的教导之后，大家放弃了下班回家的念头，一个个争先恐后地说：“把我留下！”“乙班的困难，就是我们的困难，我们一定要顾全大局。”大家协作的劲头可足了，最后，领导上考虑为了照顾第二天生产，在我们班只留下一个人去支援下一班。
    为了加强三班之间的团结协作，我们还用毛泽东思想做好交接班，上一班为下一班创造生产有利条件。我们这样做，使炼钢时间大大缩短。在二月五日一天就出了三炉钢，创造了大型平炉快速炼钢的新纪录。这些事使我深深体会到，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，心中有了大局，无政府主义思潮就没有空子可钻，抓革命、促生产都会创造出新成就。
