Last June and July, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, our family responded to Chairman Mao's call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" and launched a revolutionary critique within the family.

	Follow Chairman Mao's Instructions
My parents were both poor people in the past and had a simple class sentiment. To mobilize the whole family to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to carry out the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, we needed to further arouse the family's deep class sentiment for the great teacher Chairman Mao. At the same time, we needed to recount the bitterness of the old society to further raise the family's proletarian consciousness.

	During those days, every day after work, I would tell my father about the greatness of Chairman Mao and expose the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev. One evening, while I was telling my father about Chairman Mao being our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, I linked it to our happy lives as young people. As I spoke, my father shed tears beside me. My younger brother asked my father what was wrong. He sadly said, "Seeing you all living happily now, I think back to my bitter experiences as a child..." Then, my father recounted his hardships in the old society.

My father lost his father when he was two years old. He couldn't eat enough or keep warm. At sixteen, he started working for the landlord, working to the point of exhaustion, but still couldn't make ends meet. It wasn't until he was over thirty that he got married. At his wedding, he only had a tattered quilt, and the house he lived in was a mud cave, dark and cold. As he spoke, he couldn't continue. My mother also put down her work and, tears streaming down her face, said, "Back then, we had nothing to eat, wear, or use. I used a single stalk of sorghum to light the fire three or four times." After hearing my mother recount the bitterness of the old society, I asked, "How did we get today's happiness?" My mother said, "Chairman Mao led us to it!" My father also said, "Chairman Mao is truly great, always thinking of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Without Chairman Mao, how could we have today's happiness?" That night, the whole family was so moved that we couldn't sleep well.

From then on, whenever my mother had time, she would ask me to read Chairman Mao's quotations to her. She said, "Every time I hear Chairman Mao's words, my heart feels bright. Chairman Mao's kindness is great, his words are good, and I must remember them and act on them!" Seeing that my mother's thoughts had truly changed, I solemnly told her, "Recently, Chairman Mao has called on us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. What should we do in our family?" She said, "What do you mean? We must definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions!"

	The Family Launches the Battlefield Against Selfishness and Revisionism
Initially, my mother only knew that having "selfishness" was wrong but didn't realize that having "selfishness" meant having "revisionism," and didn't consider it a big deal. Later, I deliberately steered the conversation towards criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev. I said, "Chairman Mao is so good to us, but the biggest capitalist-roader within the party, the Chinese Khrushchev, opposes him and wants to overthrow the socialist state, take away the good days Chairman Mao has given us, and make us walk back to suffering again!" As soon as I said this, my mother angrily said, "The old ghost Chinese Khrushchev wants us to walk back to suffering and live in misery again. The old society was hell, and I would rather die than walk his path!" My father also said, "We must overthrow the villain Chinese Khrushchev to protect the socialist state."

Our family's revolutionary critique was to carry out active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works with real-life issues, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. Based on our personal experiences, we praised Chairman Mao's wisdom and greatness; we recalled the bitterness of the old society and compared it to the sweetness of the new society. Through the critique, we drew a clear line between the two classes, two roads, two line struggles, and two worldviews, establishing in our minds an unconditional love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Our family's revolutionary critique was quite flexible in form. During study sessions, at the dinner table, or when the family sat together in the morning or evening, we would all engage in revolutionary critique.

Since the cooperative movement, our family's life has been getting better day by day. However, my mother was still not satisfied, always thinking only of her own family and not the collective, saying things like, "Every family's livelihood can't do without selfishness." To address this thought, one time, while I was helping my father lay out the quilts, I deliberately asked, "Our family of four has only three quilts, how will we manage when it gets cold?" My father heard this and angrily said, "Hmph! You all have it so good now that you don't know what's enough! When I was young, I couldn't even have a quilt, let alone a good one!" I said, "Father, it's not that I'm not satisfied, I just want to ask how these quilts came to be?" Before I could finish, my mother said, "How did they come? You have to work for them yourself, no one will give them to you for free!" I said, "But in the old society, you didn't earn them..." My mother thought for a moment and said, "That's true, back then in our village of over forty households, four families were so poor they were ruined, three families had to beg for food to survive, and over twenty families had to flee to other places. Back then, there was no hope for the poor!" My father said, "The people are the same, the village is the same, but life is completely different. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao leading us on the socialist path. If we had followed the Chinese Khrushchev's path of 'self-reliance, self-management, and freedom in four areas,' we would soon be suffering again." He then used the evidence from 1962 when livestock was sent down and the mountains were opened up, damaging the collective economy, to criticize the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev. My mother said, "Our family, for the sake of small plots of land and personal gardens, didn't contribute any manure to the team. I also didn't go to work, always thinking about my own little life, all because I was tricked by the Chinese Khrushchev."

	Everyone Helps to Fight Selfishness
Chairman Mao teaches us, "All reactionary things, you don't beat them, they won't fall. This is also like sweeping the floor, if the broom doesn't reach, the dust won't run away by itself." This "selfishness" is a great enemy in our minds, if you don't attack it, it will attack you. We use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch an offensive against the enemy of "selfishness."

"Selfishness" has both open and hidden forms; it is cunning and stubborn. Today you defeat it, tomorrow it will rise again; today you defeat it on one issue, tomorrow it will rise on another. Therefore, fighting selfishness must be done at all times and in all places until it is completely eliminated.

Last year, when the team was distributing cabbages, on the first day my mother heard the news and, fearing she wouldn't get a good one, planned to not go to work the next day and wait at home for the distribution. She didn't reveal this selfish thought at the night's critique meeting. However, she struggled within herself. When she woke up at around one in the morning, she called me and asked, "I plan to not go to work tomorrow and wait at home for some cabbages, is this selfishness?" I didn't directly answer her question, I just told her, "We have been studying 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' and 'Serve the People,' haven't we? Zhang Zide was 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people, Norman Bethune was 'selflessly serving the people,' 'having no selfishness.' Think for yourself, do what is right!" The next morning at breakfast, my mother revealed this selfish thought at the table. She said, "I didn't sleep well last night, no matter how I thought about it, it didn't match Chairman Mao's teachings. If everyone goes to get good cabbages, who will get the bad ones? My selfish thought of always putting myself first is not good!"

A few days later, my younger brother picked up a few grains of wheat from the road, which led to another round of my mother's selfishness struggle. She knew that public property should not be taken by individuals, but she also thought, a few small grains of wheat, what's the big deal, if given to the team, it won't make much difference, but if kept at home to feed the chickens, it would be enough for two chickens to eat their fill; besides, picking it up is something, if not picked up, it would be wasted on the road. So, she didn't think much of it. At that night's critique meeting, my younger brother criticized this incident. He said, "The team's wheat should be sent to the team, but I brought it home, this is selfishness." At this time, my mother still argued, "A few small grains of wheat count as selfishness? If there is selfishness, reveal it, if there isn't, don't force it!" After studying 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' together, she finally recognized this "selfishness." She said, "This 'selfishness' is really sneaky, it's everywhere, even in such a small matter!"

	Follow Chairman Mao for a Lifetime of Revolution
Through fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, the whole family's class consciousness was raised, promoting the revolutionization of the family.

First, the whole family's love for Chairman Mao in their minds became even stronger. The person whose thoughts changed the most was my mother. She realized that reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions is the fundamental path for poor and lower-middle peasants. She was the first among the elderly to wear Chairman Mao's badge. She said, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, wearing his badge, I will always be clear-minded."

Studying and reciting Chairman Mao's quotations whenever there is time has become a habit in our family.

Second, the whole family firmly decided to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life. My father was very enthusiastic about being the team leader, leading the villagers to work every day from dawn to dusk. He said, "As long as the revolution needs me, and the poor and lower-middle peasants trust me, I will work until I'm old." My mother, who used to be content with her own little garden and personal affairs, became a person who cared about the revolution, loved the collective, and broke selfishness to establish public-mindedness.

Third, our family changed old traditions and created new family customs. In the past, conversations didn't leave personal gardens and small families, now it's about national affairs, and before doing anything, we fight selfishness. In the past, my mother was the head of the family, and if anyone spoke against her, they would be scolded; now, if anyone has a flaw, everyone criticizes, if anyone has selfish thoughts, we sit together and fight it, as long as it benefits the collective, anyone can take the lead.

Last autumn, my father felt that the team's work was almost done, the ground was about to freeze, and our home's kang (heated bed) hadn't been changed, so he wanted to take a day off to work on it. At this time, the commune issued a call to plant trees and build forests, and after a family discussion, we all agreed: planting trees is a collective matter, related to "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and we can't let personal matters affect collective matters. My mother said, "If we, as the leaders, stay at home to change the kang, how will others do it? If everyone stays at home to change the kang, the trees won't be planted!" So, my father immediately led the villagers to plant trees.

Fourth, everyone in our family cares about national affairs and knows the importance of putting politics in command. In the past, my father only focused on production and didn't ask about politics. He said, "The team leader is the one who leads everyone to work and do a good job in production, and then everything will be fine." Now he has changed, although he is illiterate, he calls on the villagers every day to study Chairman Mao's works and mobilizes the masses to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. The villagers say, "The Cultural Revolution has truly changed the old team leader!" In the past, my mother would visit others' homes and talk about small living matters, now she goes everywhere talking about Chairman Mao's great achievements and sharing her experiences in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism.

    斗私批修树立新家风
    辽宁省朝阳县西营子公社仇家店大队学习毛主席著作积极分子　洪文兰
    去年六、七月间，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，我家响应了毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，家庭里进行了革命大批判。
      毛主席咋说咱就咋办
    我的父母过去都是受苦人，有着朴素的阶级感情。要发动全家活学活用毛主席著作，开展斗私批修，就要进一步激发全家人对伟大导师毛主席深厚的阶级感情。同时大诉旧社会的苦，进一步提高全家人的无产阶级觉悟。
    在那些日子里，每天收工回来，我就给我爸爸讲毛主席他老人家的伟大，同时大揭中国赫鲁晓夫的罪恶。有天晚上，我给爸爸讲毛主席是我们革命人民的伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手的时候，联系着谈起我们青年一代过的幸福生活。说着说着，我爸爸在一旁掉下了眼泪。我弟弟问我爸爸咋的了？他伤心地说：“看到你们现在的幸福生活，就想起了我小时候的酸心事……”。接着，爸爸就诉起自己在旧社会的苦。
    爸爸两岁的时候就死了父亲。吃不饱，穿不暖。十六岁就给地主扛活，拚死拚活地干，还是糊不住口。一直到三十多岁才成家。结婚时，只有一床破薄被，住的房子是土洞棚个盖，又黑又冷。讲着讲着，他说不下去了。妈妈也放下手里的活，流着眼泪说：“那时候吃、烧、穿，用啥也没有，一根高粱荛子我引过三、四次火。”听我妈诉了旧社会的苦，我就问：“今天的幸福是咋得来的？”我妈说：“毛主席领导的呗！”爸爸也说：“毛主席就是伟大，啥事都想着咱贫下中农。若是没有毛主席他老人家，咋会有今天呢？”这一夜一家人都感动得没有睡好觉。
    从那以后，我妈有工夫就叫我给她念毛主席语录。她说：“我一听到毛主席的话，心里就豁亮。毛主席的恩情就是大，话说的就是好，我可得用心记住，照着去做！”我看我妈的思想真变了，就郑重其事地跟她说：“最近，毛主席叫咱们斗私批修呢。你说咱们家该咋办？”她说：“那还用说，咱们坚决按照毛主席说的办呗！”
        家里摆开了斗私批修战场
    起初，我妈光知道有“私”不对，没认识到有
  “私”就有“修”，没把它当成什么大不了的事情。后来，我就有意地往批判中国赫鲁晓夫的事上引。我说：“毛主席对咱们这样好，可是党内最大的走资派中国赫鲁晓夫却反对他老人家，要把社会主义的江山推翻，把毛主席给咱的好日子夺走，叫咱们走回头路，受二遍苦呢！”我这么一说，我妈就气冲冲地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫这个老鬼，想叫我们走回头路，再过苦日子。过去那个世道是地狱，我死了也不能走他那条路！”我爸爸也说：“中国赫鲁晓夫这个坏蛋不打倒，社会主义江山就没法保。”
    我家的革命大批判，就是带着现实的思想问题，活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修。根据自己的切身体会，颂扬毛主席的英明伟大；围绕批判的问题，忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜。通过大批判，划清两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线、两种世界观的界限，在头脑里树立对毛主席、对毛泽东思想无限热爱的阶级感情。
    我家的革命大批判，形式比较灵活。在学习会上，吃饭桌上，或者一家人早晚坐在一起时，都进行革命大批判。
    从合作化以来，我们家的生活一天比一天好。可是我妈还不知足，总是只顾自己家，不顾集体，说什么“谁家过日子也离不开私”。针对这种思想，一次，我给我爸爸铺毡子的时候，故意地问：“咱们家四口人，才三床毡子，多会赶那床啊？”我爸一听，生气地说：“哼！你们过上好日子都不知咋的了，这么多毡子还不知足？！我小时候，别说铺毡子，能铺上一床破褥子就好哩！”我说：“爸爸，不是我不知足，我是想问咱这些毡子是咋来的？”没等我说完，我妈就说：“咋来的，自己不挣可没人白给你！”我说：“旧社会你咋没挣来呢……”我妈寻思寻思说：“可也是，过去咱们村子四十多户，有四户穷得家破人亡，有三户靠要饭活着，有二十多户逃荒在外。那时候没咱穷人的天日！”我爸爸说：“人还是那个人，村还是那个村，生活可大不一样了。这都是毛主席领导走社会主义道路的好处，若是照中国赫鲁晓夫的那个‘三自一包’、‘四大自由’的道走，又快受大穷了。”接着，他用一九六二年牲畜下放，大开山损害集体经济的铁证，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论。我妈说：“咱家为了搞小开荒、自留地，好粪一点不往队里投。我还不出工，整天想着自己的小日子，这都是上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当。”
        一人有“私”全家帮助斗
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”“私”字这个东西，是我们头脑中的大敌，你不进攻它，它就进攻你。我们以毛泽东思想为武器，向“私”字这个敌人打了进攻仗。
      “私”字有公开的，有暗藏的；“私”字很狡猾，也很顽固。今天斗倒了，明天还会冒出来；今天在这个问题上斗倒了，明天还会从另一个问题上冒出来。所以，斗私必须时时斗，处处斗，直至把它消灭。
    去年队里分白菜，头一天我妈听到这个信儿，怕自己分不着好的，就准备第二天不出工，在家里等着分菜。她在晚上斗私会上，没有亮这个私心。可是她内心展开了斗争。当睡到半夜一点多钟时，她叫醒我，问道：“我明天想不出工，在家等着分点菜，这算私心吗？”我没有直接回答她的问题，我就给她讲：
  “咱不是学习《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》了吗？张思德是‘完全’、‘彻底’为人民服务，白求恩是‘毫不利己专门利人’，‘毫无自私自利之心’。你自己想一想，怎么对就怎么做！”第二天早饭时，我妈就在饭桌上亮了这个私心。她说：“我半宿没睡着，咋想也和毛主席的教导对不上号，若都去分好白菜，剩下次的给谁呢，我这种啥事先想自己的私心眼可不好！”
    过了几天，我弟弟从路上拣回来几个谷穗，这件事又引起我妈一场斗私活动。她知道公家的东西，个人不该要；但又一想，几个小谷穗算个啥，交给队里也看不出多来，若是留在家里喂鸡，足够两只鸡吃个饱；再说，拣回来是点东西，如果不拣回来，在道上也糟践了。她就没把它当回事。在这天晚上的斗私会上，我弟弟检讨了这件事。他说：“队上的谷穗，应当送到队上去，可我拿回家来了，这是私心。”这时，我妈还分辩说：“几个小谷穗还算私心？有私就亮，没私别强亮！”经过和她一起学习《纪念白求恩》，她终于认识了这个“私”。她说：“私”字这个东西真鬼，到处都有，这么大点小事上也藏着私！
    跟着毛主席干一辈子革命
    通过斗私批修，提高了全家人的阶级觉悟，促进了家庭革命化。
    第一、全家人在思想上更加热爱毛主席。思想变化最大的是我妈，她认识到：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，是贫下中农的根本。她在老年人里，是第一个戴上毛主席像章的。她说：“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，戴上他老人家的像章，我永远心明眼亮。”
    有空就学毛主席语录，背毛主席语录，在我们家里成了习惯。
    第二、一家人都坚定地跟毛主席闹一辈子革命。我爸当队长干得可有劲了，每天起早贪黑地领着社员干，他说：“只要革命需要，贫下中农信任我，我就干到老。”我妈由一个“站在屋檐下，看到自留地，坐到炕头上，算计小日子”的人，变成了一个关心革命，热爱集体，破私立公的人。
    第三、我家改变了旧传统，出现了新家风。过去说话不离自留地和个人小家庭，现在说的是国家大事，办事先斗私。过去，我妈是一家之主，谁说话不顺着她就得挨骂；现在，谁有缺点，就大家批评，谁有私心，就坐在一起斗，只要对集体有好处的事，谁都敢作主。
    去年秋天，我爸觉得队里活干得差不多了，地快上冻了，家里的炕还没换，想在家脱一天坯。这时正赶上公社发出植树造林的号召，全家一讨论，一致认为：植树是集体的事，是关系到“备战、备荒、为人民”的大事，不能因为个人的私事影响集体的事。我妈说：“咱这当头行人的在家换炕，别人咋办呢？都在家换炕，树还栽不！”于是，我爸立即带动社员植树去了。
    第四、我家的人都关心国家大事了，知道突出政治了。我爸过去只抓生产，不问政治。他说：“队长就是干活打头的，领着大家搞好生产，啥都有了。”现在变了，他虽然不识字，可是天天招呼着社员学习毛主席著作，发动群众斗私批修。群众说：“文化大革命，可真把老队长革变样了！”我妈过去到别人家串门，总是说些生活小事，现在到哪儿都讲毛主席的丰功伟绩，说自己斗私批修的体会。
