In the Revolutionary Committee and Among the Masses

The non-full-time members of the Qian'an County Revolutionary Committee are closely connected with the masses, heart to heart, facing the entire county, and working actively, making the Revolutionary Committee deeply rooted among the masses.

Editor's Note: The experience of Qian'an County Revolutionary Committee in fully utilizing the role of non-full-time members at the grassroots level is very worthy of attention. These members are representatives of the revolutionary masses. They are closely connected with the masses, heart to heart, and are the best bridge between the Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary masses. Fully utilizing their role, the Revolutionary Committee will have a solid mass foundation. This is a major advantage of the newly established "three-in-one combination" revolutionary government.

To fully utilize the role of non-full-time members, revolutionary leading cadres and full-time members must enthusiastically help them, respect them, rely on them, and learn from them, rather than treating them as mere decorations. This is a fundamental attitude towards the masses and a major issue of whether to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This problem must be solved well.

The Qian'an County Revolutionary Committee in Hebei Province, according to Chairman Mao's great thought of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," has fully utilized the role of non-full-time members who do not leave their production, making the Revolutionary Committee deeply rooted among the masses.

Of the 49 members of this county's Revolutionary Committee, 33 are at the grassroots level and mostly do not leave their production. Their revolutionary enthusiasm is high, and their determination to wield power properly is strong. However, some people think that although they have become members, truly managing the county's major affairs still depends on full-time members. Some comrades say: "We come to meetings, and the standing committee discusses and decides how we should do it." Some full-time members, when there are problems, are willing to report to the full-time standing committee, thinking that it is better to solve problems by finding the full-time standing committee than by finding a non-full-time vice chairman.

These active thoughts have drawn the attention of the standing committee. The standing committee believes that the Revolutionary Committee is a new-born proletarian revolutionary government. In work, is it to strengthen collective leadership, fully utilize the role of the members, and jointly wield power properly, or is it to follow the old ways, with a few people issuing orders? This is a matter of two-line struggle. In a meeting of all members, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on party committee leadership and the mass line, as well as relevant editorials. Everyone realized that the foundation of the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ is the broad revolutionary masses. The non-full-time members who often stay at the grassroots level are representatives of the revolutionary masses. The Revolutionary Committee must fully utilize their role and pay attention to their opinions. Otherwise, it cannot truly become a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power organ. In the discussion, everyone also realized that the non-full-time members at the grassroots level live among the masses and best understand the opinions and demands of the masses. At the same time, as Chairman Mao taught: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience." Not paying attention to the opinions of these members means not being able to well concentrate the wisdom of the masses. For these non-full-time members themselves, whether they actively play their due role is a matter of whether they can wholeheartedly serve the people.

After raising their ideological awareness, they also paid attention to improving their work methods. For example, the standing committee often goes down to hold meetings with the members who live at the grassroots level, organizing everyone to exchange experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works and achieving ideological revolutionization; conveying upper-level instructions and the standing committee's work opinions to these members, organizing everyone to study and discuss. The secretariat of the county Revolutionary Committee's office also often goes down to strengthen contact with these members. The county Revolutionary Committee also requires the leading comrades of the areas and communes where these members are located to often solicit their opinions and pay attention to summarizing and promoting their work experiences.

Now, the non-full-time members have a strong sense of revolutionary responsibility and work very actively. Many of them can stand in their own units, face the entire county, actively report situations to the county Revolutionary Committee, make suggestions, and play a leading and exemplary role in revolution and production. Li Fa, the party branch secretary of Li Jia Stretch Brigade of Malan Public Community, is a member of the county Revolutionary Committee. After receiving the county Revolutionary Committee's notice on holding large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, he actively went to the public community to discuss and arrange with the leading cadres. At the meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres held by the public community, he solicited opinions and demands for the county Revolutionary Committee from one brigade to another and reported them to the county Revolutionary Committee. Now, many brigades in this public community often find him to report and discuss problems. Wang Hongxin, a member of the county Revolutionary Committee living in Quhe Brigade of Xuliucamp Public Community, after understanding the spirit of the Tangshan area Revolutionary Committee's instructions on holding large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, immediately organized the poor and lower-middle peasants in his village to discuss and mobilize everyone to actively hold and participate in study classes. Previously, the number of women participating in studies in this brigade was relatively small. Under Wang Hongxin's promotion, twelve women's study classes were quickly set up, with more than 250 people participating in the studies. In this way, not only was the revolution and production in this brigade greatly promoted, but also experience was created for holding women's study classes throughout the county.

    身在革委会  立足群众中
    迁安县革委会不脱产委员和群众息息相关，心心相连，面向全县，积极工作，使革委会深深扎根于群众中
    编者按：迁安县革命委员会充分发挥基层单位不脱产委员的作用的经验，很值得重视。这些委员是革命群众的代表，他们和群众息息相关，心心相连，是革委会和革命群众之间最好的桥梁。充分发挥他们的作用，革命委员会就有了深厚的群众基础。这正是新生的“三结合”革命政权的一大优点。
      要充分发挥不脱产委员的作用，革命领导干部和脱产的委员就要满腔热情地帮助他们，尊重他们，依靠他们，向他们学习，而不是把他们看作陪衬。这是对待群众的根本态度问题，是执行不执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题。这个问题一定要解决好。
    本报讯　河北省迁安县革命委员会，根据毛主席的革命“三结合”的伟大思想，充分发挥不脱离生产的委员的作用，使革委会深深扎根于群众中。
    这个县革命委员会的四十九名成员中，有三十三名在基层单位，大都不脱离生产。他们的革命热情很高，掌好权用好权的决心很大。但是，有的人认为自己虽然当了委员，但真正管理全县的大事，还得依靠脱产的委员。有的同志说：“开会我们就来，常委怎么研究决定，我们就怎么办。”有的脱产委员，有问题愿意找脱产常委反映，认为找脱产常委比找不脱产的副主任委员还解决问题。
    这些活思想，引起了常委的重视。常委认为，革命委员会是新生的无产阶级革命政权。在工作上，是加强集体领导，充分发挥委员们的作用，共同掌好权用好权，还是走老路子，由少数人发号施令？这是两条路线斗争的问题。在一次全体委员会议上，他们学习了毛主席有关党委领导和群众路线的教导以及有关社论。大家认识到，革命“三结合”临时权力机构的基础，是广大革命群众。经常住基层单位的不脱产的委员，是革命群众的代表。革命委员会必须充分发挥他们的作用，必须重视他们的意见。否则，就不能真正成为一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。在讨论中，大家还认识到，基层单位不脱产的委员，生活在群众之中，最了解群众的意见和要求。同时，正如毛主席所教导的：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”不注意听取这些委员的意见，就不能很好地集中群众的智慧。就这部分不脱产的委员本身来说，当主人还是当客人，是否积极发挥自己应有的作用，则是能否全心全意为人民服务的问题。
    思想认识提高以后，他们又注意从工作方法上加以改进。如常委经常下去，分片召开住基层单位的委员的碰头会，组织大家交流自己活学活用毛主席著作，实现思想革命化的经验；向这些委员传达上级指示和常委会的工作意见，组织大家研究讨论。县革委会办公室秘书组的同志也经常下去，加强同这些委员的联系。县革委会还要求这些委员所在区、社的领导同志，经常征询这些委员的意见，注意总结推广他们的工作经验。
    现在，不脱产的委员们革命责任心都很强，工作非常积极。许多人都能立足本单位，面向全县，积极向县革委会反映情况，提出建议，并且在革命和生产中起带头、模范作用。马兰庄公社李家沟大队党支部书记李发，是县革委会委员。他在接到县革委会关于大办毛泽东思想学习班的通知后，主动到公社找领导班子研究安排。在公社召开的贫下中农和干部会议上，他一个大队一个大队地征求了对县革委会的意见和要求，反映给县革委会。现在，这个公社的许多大队经常找他反映和讨论问题。住徐流营公社曲河大队的县革委会委员王红新，了解到唐山地区革委会关于大办毛泽东思想学习班的指示精神以后，立即组织本村贫下中农座谈研究，动员大家积极举办和参加学习班。过去，这个大队妇女参加学习的比较少，在王红新的推动下，很快办起了十二个妇女学习班，参加学习的达二百五十多人。这样，不仅有力地推动了本大队的革命和生产，而且为全县办好妇女学习班创造了经验。
