American imperialism is suffering from a serious illness. The failure of its war in Vietnam and the worsening of the dollar crisis are its two most significant ailments at present. These two issues influence and exacerbate each other.

The dollar crisis originated from the continuous increase in the United States' massive fiscal budget deficit and trade deficit. Severe inflation and the depletion of gold reserves have led to a rapid decline in the dollar's credibility both domestically and internationally. The aggressive war that American imperialism is waging in Vietnam is a crucial factor in deepening America's financial woes. The annual cost of the war in Vietnam has reached three hundred billion dollars, with nearly one-third of the U.S. federal government's expenditures being spent on the battlefield in Vietnam. This not only makes the U.S. fiscal deficit worse, but also makes it impossible to reduce the trade deficit.

At the same time, the dollar crisis exacerbates the difficulties American imperialism faces in the Vietnam War, making it even more impossible to reverse the losing situation. American imperialism wants to intensify its military actions in Vietnam, but financial difficulties constrain it. The various "austerity" measures taken by the U.S. ruling class to alleviate financial difficulties are first directed at the people, which will inevitably lead to a surge in the American people's movement against the Vietnam War. This situation of internal and external pressures, how can American imperialism withstand it?

American imperialism, in an attempt to salvage its failure in Vietnam, continues to escalate the war of aggression, which will inevitably deepen the dollar crisis. The deepening of the dollar crisis will, in turn, create even greater difficulties for American imperialism in the Vietnam War. This forms a vicious cycle, a fatal blow to American imperialism.

This vicious cycle is not a temporary or accidental phenomenon. It is determined by the inherent contradictions within the imperialist system and by the various contradictions currently facing American imperialism.

American imperialism is at odds with the people of the world, engaging in frenzied aggression and expansion. However, its manpower, military strength, material resources, and financial resources are far from sufficient compared to its ambition to dominate the globe. In the face of the world revolutionary tide that is shaking the four seas and five continents, the externally strong but internally weak and increasingly declining American imperialism is increasingly finding itself in a situation where it is overwhelmed and beaten everywhere. It cannot handle one thing without neglecting another. It wants to strengthen its military aggression, but financial support is insufficient; and to save the financial crisis, military aggression is even more unsustainable. The current serious dollar crisis is the result of these insurmountable contradictions.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The various irreconcilable contradictions within and outside the country are like a volcano, threatening American imperialism every day. American imperialism is sitting on this volcano."

Undoubtedly, the continuous "earthquakes" in the capitalist world, big and small, will one day trigger the total eruption of this volcano, thus announcing the total collapse of American imperialism!

    恶性循环
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义正患着一身重病。侵越战争的失败和美元危机的恶化，是它当前最主要的两大痼疾。而这二者又是互相影响，互相促进的。
    美元危机，起因于美国连年增加的巨额财政预算赤字和国际收支逆差。严重的通货膨胀和黄金储备的枯竭，造成了美元在国内外信用的急剧下降。而美帝国主义在越南进行的侵略战争成为加深美国财政恶化的一个十分重要的因素。美帝国主义每年的侵越战费已高达三百亿美元，美国联邦政府的开支将近三分之一耗费在越南战场上。这不仅使得美国财政赤字有增无已，而且使得美国的国际收支逆差无法减少。
    同时，美元危机又反过来增加美帝国主义侵越战争中的困难，使它更加无法挽救败局。美帝国主义要在越南加强战争行动，但是财政金融困难又使它受到一定的约制。而美国统治集团为了缓和财政金融困难而采取的种种“紧缩”措施，首先是针对人民开刀，这势必促使美国人民反对侵越战争的运动更加高涨。这种内外夹攻的局面，美帝国主义怎么招架得住？
    美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南的失败，不断地扩大这场侵略战争，必然使美元危机日益加深。而美元危机的日益加深，又必然造成美帝国主义在侵越战争中的更大困难。这样就形成一种恶性循环，成为美帝国主义的致命伤。
    这种恶性循环，绝不是一时的、偶然的现象。它是帝国主义制度内部的固有矛盾所决定的，也是当前美帝国主义所面临的各种矛盾所决定的。
    美帝国主义同全世界人民为敌，进行疯狂的侵略和扩张。但是它的人力、军力、物力和财力，同它独霸全球的野心比较起来，是远远不足的。在四海翻腾、五洲震荡的世界革命洪流面前，外强中干、日益没落的美帝国主义，越来越陷于穷于应付，处处挨打的境地。它顾了这一头，顾不了那一头。它要加强军事侵略力量，财政金融支持不了；而要挽救财政金融危机，军事侵略力量又更加顶不住。目前这一场严重的美元危机，就是在这种不可克服的重重矛盾中爆发的。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席指出：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”
    毫无疑问，资本主义世界的大大小小的连续不断的“地震”，终有一天要引起这座火山的总爆发，从而宣告美帝国主义的总崩溃！
