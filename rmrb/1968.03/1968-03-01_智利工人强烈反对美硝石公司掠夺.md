Workers at the Maria Elena and Pedro de Valdivia nitrate plants in northern Chile's Antofagasta province have been holding militant mass meetings since the 15th, protesting against the government's plan to establish a "joint venture" nitrate company with the American-owned Anglo-Lautaro Nitrate Company.

The Anglo-Lautaro Company, which already controls about two-thirds of the industry, is now following the same conspiratorial tactics used by the American copper companies in Chile. It aims to intensify its economic infiltration and control over Chile's nitrate industry under the guise of a "joint venture."

    智利工人强烈反对美硝石公司掠夺
    智利北部安托法加斯塔省的玛丽亚·埃伦娜硝石厂和佩德罗·德巴尔迪维亚硝石厂的全体工人从十五日起连续举行富有战斗性的群众大会，反对政府同美资安格洛—劳塔罗硝石公司建立
  “联营”硝石公司的计划。
    已经控制着这项工业三分之二左右的安格洛—劳塔罗公司，现在仿效在智利的美国铜公司利阴谋手法，要在“联营”的掩盖下加紧它对智的硝石工业的经济渗透和控制。
