Editor's Note: For a long time, Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, has advocated a whole set of revisionist party-building lines. He brazenly opposes using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of our party, vigorously promotes the bourgeois worldview, advocates detaching from class struggle and revolutionary practice to engage in idealist "cultivation," peddles the fallacy of the "party of the whole people," and attempts to change the nature of our party, turning the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party into a revisionist party.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The party organization should be composed of the advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy." Chairman Mao's great directive is the most powerful weapon for us to thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist party-building line and is the great program for us to rectify the party organization and strengthen party building.

The representatives of the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the armored forces criticized Liu Shaoqi's revisionist party-building line during the conference. They used their personal experiences in struggle to prove: A party organization armed with Mao Zedong Thought is a strong fortress of the proletariat; a Communist Party member nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought is a true vanguard warrior of the proletariat. These experiences once again tell us that only by further studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and arming the broad masses of party members with Mao Zedong Thought can we thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of Liu Shaoqi's revisionist party-building line and build our party into an even more vigorous vanguard organization of the proletariat capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy.

    装甲兵学习毛主席著作积极分子革命大批判文章选登
    编者按：长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫提出了一整套修正主义建党路线，猖狂地反对用毛泽东思想作为我们党的指导思想，竭力宣扬资产阶级世界观，鼓吹脱离阶级斗争、脱离革命实践去搞唯心主义的“修养”，贩卖“全民党”的谬论，妄图改变我们党的性质，使伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党变成修正主义的党。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”毛主席的这个伟大指示，是我们彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线最锐利的武器，是我们整顿党的组织和加强党的建设的伟大纲领。
    装甲兵首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表，在会议期间批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线。他们用亲身的斗争经验证明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的党组织是无产阶级坚强的战斗堡垒；用毛泽东思想哺育成长起来的共产党员，是真正的无产阶级先锋队战士。这些经验再一次告诉我们，只有进一步活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装广大党员，才能彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线的流毒，把我们党建设成为更加能够领导无产阶级和革命群众对阶级敌人进行战斗的、更加朝气蓬勃的无产阶级先锋队组织。
