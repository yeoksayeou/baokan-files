	Cherish the Democracy of the Proletariat and Oppose the "Freedom" of the Bourgeoisie
	Beijing Silk Thread Factory Worker, Fu Jinting

	"The freedom I have is none of your business!" This kind of talk is currently being used to support a part of the people in promoting anarchism within enterprises.

	What is freedom? I have a deep understanding of this. Before liberation, my father worked for the landlord, and when I was three years old, he was worked to death. At the age of eleven, my mother sent me to a capitalist workshop as an apprentice. I worked seventeen hours a day for three whole years without earning a single cent or a piece of cloth. I resisted this exploitation and demanded my rightful rights, but as a result, I was kicked out of the factory. Under the capitalist's brutal exploitation and oppression, all we had was the freedom to be exploited. After liberation, Chairman Mao led us workers to rise up, but the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road wanted to drag our enterprises back onto the capitalist road. When I and some of my colleagues in the factory stood up to rebel against them, a group of revolutionary comrades were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." Under the rule of the bourgeois reactionary line, what freedom did we have?! It was at this critical moment that Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the Sixteen Points, giving the proletarian revolutionary faction the democratic right to carry out the "Four Greats." In the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, we used the sharp weapon of the "Four Greats" to expose all monsters and demons, and fiercely criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. If it were not for Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, could the working class have such democratic rights?

	Freedom and democracy both have specific class content. Those who are now singing the praises of "my freedom" are, in essence, seeking not the freedom of the proletariat, but the "individual liberation" and personal indulgence of the bourgeoisie. When they say "you can't interfere," the result is that they do not want proletarian ideology to interfere, but rather bourgeois ideology. In their minds, there is no socialist discipline, no proletarian unity, only an "I." If such anarchist thoughts are allowed to spread, they will seriously corrupt the unity of will in our revolutionary ranks, damage the authority of the proletarian revolution, and undermine socialist discipline. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people enjoy extensive democracy and freedom; at the same time, they must discipline themselves with socialist discipline." We revolutionary workers must cherish the democratic rights of socialism and resist the infiltration of anarchist thoughts.

    珍惜无产阶级的民主反对资产阶级的“自由”
    北京丝线厂工人  傅金亭
    “我有我的自由，你管不着！”这种论调，目前正在支持着一部分人在企业中大搞无政府主义。
    什么是自由，我是感受很深的。解放前，我父亲给地主干活，在我三岁的时候，他就活活的给累死了。十一岁，母亲把我送到资本家的作坊里当学徒，一天干十七个小时，整整三年，没有拿到一文钱，一寸布。我反抗这种剥削，要求正当的权利，结果被赶出了厂房。在资本家残酷的剥削压迫下，我们有的只是被剥削的自由。解放后，毛主席领导我们工人翻了身，但是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派却要把我们企业重新拉上资本主义道路。当我和工厂的一部分同志起来造他们的反的时候，有一批革命同志却被打成“反革命”。在资产阶级反动路线的统治下，我们又有什么自由呢？！就是在这样关键的时刻，是毛主席亲自主持制订了十六条，给了无产阶级革命派开展“四大”的民主权利。在轰轰烈烈的文化大革命中，我们运用“四大”的锐利武器，揭露一切牛鬼蛇神，狠批党内一小撮走资派。如果没有毛主席和毛主席的革命路线，我们工人阶级能有这样的民主权利吗？
    自由和民主都是有具体阶级内容的。现在那些高唱“我有我的自由”的人，说穿了，他们要的不是无产阶级的自由，而是资产阶级的“个性解放”和个人放任。他们说“你管不着”，其结果只能是不要无产阶级思想管，而要资产阶级思想管。在这些人的心目中，没有社会主义纪律，也没有无产阶级的集中，有的只是一个“我”字。如果让这种无政府主义思想泛滥下去，就会严重腐蚀我们革命队伍的统一意志，损害无产阶级革命权威，败坏社会主义纪律。毛主席教导我们：“人民享受着广泛的民主和自由；同时又必须用社会主义的纪律约束自己。”我们革命工人，一定要懂得珍惜社会主义的民主权利，抵制无政府主义思想的侵蚀。
