The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on March 21 sent a note of protest to the Soviet Embassy in China, strongly condemning the new serious crime of the Soviet revisionist leadership's active collusion with U.S. imperialism in creating the "Two Chinas" plot. The note pointed out that the 700 million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. The Soviet revisionist leadership's actions only further expose their shameful role as accomplices of U.S. imperialism in the eyes of the people of the world.

The note said: The sixth issue of the 1968 "New Books of the Soviet Union" published by the Soviet revisionist International Bookstore features a photograph of the Olympic Games on the inner cover page, which includes the so-called "national emblem" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The Soviet side also provocatively sent this catalog to the Chinese side. This is a new serious crime of the Soviet government actively colluding with U.S. imperialism in creating the "Two Chinas" plot, a blatant political provocation against the 700 million Chinese people, and an ironclad piece of evidence of the Soviet government's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in opposing the great People's Republic of China. The Chinese government strongly protests this to the Soviet government.

The note said: The Soviet revisionist leadership has long been actively colluding with U.S. imperialism in creating the "Two Chinas" plot. Soviet representatives have long been sitting on the same bench with the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in so-called international conferences. In Soviet publications, Taiwan is openly referred to as a "state," and it is propagated that "Taiwan and Beijing should both become members of the United Nations." The Chinese government has repeatedly protested to the Soviet government regarding the Soviet authorities' involvement in U.S. imperialism's creation of the "Two Chinas" plot, but the Soviet government has repeatedly ignored the Chinese government's serious stance and has become even more despicable and shameless in actively colluding with U.S. imperialism in creating the "Two Chinas" plot.

The note concluded: We must warn the Soviet government: Taiwan is an inseparable part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China. Any attempt to create "Two Chinas" in any form will definitely fail and will meet with the resolute opposition of the Chinese people. The 700 million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. Your actions only further expose your shameful role as accomplices of U.S. imperialism in the eyes of the people of the world.

    我外交部强烈抗议苏修配合美帝制造“两个中国”的罪恶阴谋
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民不可侮
    新华社二十一日讯 中华人民共和国外交部二十一日照会苏联驻华大使馆，强烈抗议苏修领导集团积极配合美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的新的严重罪行。照会指出，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不可侮的。苏修领导集团这样做，只能在全世界人民面前更加暴露他们是美帝帮凶的可耻嘴脸。
    照会说：一九六八年出版的苏修国际书店《苏联新书》目录第六期封面内页宣传奥林匹克运动会的照片中，竟刊登蒋匪帮的所谓“国徽”。苏联方面还挑衅性地把上述目录寄给了中国方面。这是苏联政府积极配合美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的新的严重罪行，是对七亿中国人民的明目张胆的政治挑衅，是苏联政府勾结蒋匪帮反对伟大的中华人民共和国的一个新的铁的罪证。对此，中国政府向苏联政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会说：苏修领导集团积极配合美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的罪恶阴谋由来已久。苏联代表早就同蒋匪帮的“代表”坐在一条板凳上开什么国际会议。在苏联报刊上公开把中国的台湾说成是一个“国家”，并宣传什么“台湾和北京都应成为联合国成员”。中国政府曾不止一次地就苏联当局参预美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的活动，向苏联政府提出抗议，但苏联政府却一再无视中国政府的严正立场，更加卑鄙无耻地积极配合美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    照会最后说：我们要正告苏联政府：台湾是中华人民共和国神圣领土不可分割的一部分。任何人企图以任何形式制造“两个中国”的阴谋，是绝对不能得逞的，都将遭到中国人民的坚决反对。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不可侮的。你们这样做，只能在全世界人民面前更加暴露你们是美帝帮凶的可耻嘴脸。
