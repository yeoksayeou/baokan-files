The work of the Revolutionary Committee is complex; emphasizing politics leads to victory. The People's Liberation Army shares its political work experience with the Lu Long County Revolutionary Committee, igniting a fervent atmosphere of revolution and production throughout the county.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 15th, the 4676 Unit of the People's Liberation Army and the Lu Long County Military Department's leftist support personnel, after the establishment of the county Revolutionary Committee, actively shared with the committee members and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations the army's experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the Four Firsts, and promoting the Three-Eight Style. This significantly enhanced their awareness of emphasizing proletarian politics, creating a vibrant scene of revolution and production across the county.

Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Lu Long County established its Revolutionary Committee in November last year. At that time, there were countless tasks to handle, and some comrades were unsure where to start. Some comrades were buried in administrative work all day, resulting in more confusion the more they tried to manage.

The 4676 Unit of the People's Liberation Army and the Military Department personnel supporting Lu Long County analyzed these situations and believed that this was a crucial issue of whether to build the Revolutionary Committee into a command center for upholding Mao Zedong Thought or to reduce it to a purely administrative leadership team. It was also a critical issue of whether the Revolutionary Committee could be consolidated and developed. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the guiding force and the soul, and Comrade Lin Biao's discussions on emphasizing politics and the revolutionary transformation of the leadership team. The county Revolutionary Committee bears the fundamental task of leading the people of the entire county to uphold Mao Zedong Thought and turn the entire county into a red-hot Mao Zedong Thought school. It is necessary to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, emphasizing proletarian politics at all times, in all places, and in all matters, to fulfill this task. The leftist support personnel regarded helping the Revolutionary Committee leaders and proletarian revolutionary leaders to adhere to the path of emphasizing proletarian politics as a highly important task.

The leftist support troops and Military Department personnel first helped the county Revolutionary Committee organize a Mao Zedong Thought study class for revolutionary cadres and leaders of mass organizations. They organized everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the guiding force and the soul, and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," and Comrade Lin Biao's related discussions on emphasizing proletarian politics. During the study, everyone angrily denounced the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his small clique in the county who tried every means to oppose emphasizing proletarian politics and studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Some erring cadres also spoke from personal experience, summarizing the lessons of not emphasizing proletarian politics, losing direction in class struggle, and not standing firm in their stance. Before the study class ended, the county Revolutionary Committee, after serious discussion, passed three resolutions: to launch a high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions; to improve leadership style and promote the ideological revolutionization of the leadership team; to launch a new high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production." The county Revolutionary Committee and the leadership bodies of revolutionary mass organizations, taking the People's Liberation Army as an example, established institutions such as "daily reading," "report and share sessions," and "study days." They also organized a three-in-one Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team consisting of revolutionary cadres, proletarian revolutionaries, and the People's Liberation Army, to deeply propagate Mao Zedong Thought in rural areas, spread the experience of emphasizing proletarian politics, and firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Based on helping the county Revolutionary Committee members improve their understanding, the leftist support personnel and the army comrades participating in the three-in-one leadership team actively went deep into various levels of cadres, studying Chairman Mao's works with them, and in practical struggles, passing on the army's experiences of adhering to the Four Firsts and emphasizing proletarian politics. In February this year, during the county-wide "grasp revolution, promote production" rally, some comrades thought the meeting mainly addressed production arrangements, believing that as long as targets were set and measures were outlined, the purpose would be achieved. At this time, the army comrades participating in the county Revolutionary Committee immediately pointed out sincerely that Chairman Mao taught us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." It is necessary to adhere to emphasizing proletarian politics and to lead production with revolution. With the help of the army comrades, the meeting focused on studying how to firmly grasp the ideological revolutionization of people during spring plowing and production, using revolution to drive production, and other issues. The meeting was concluded as a session of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, a session of exchanging experiences of emphasizing proletarian politics. As soon as the meeting ended, the entire county launched a high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production."

Chairman Mao taught us: "We should go among the masses, learn from the masses, and summarize their experiences into better, more systematic principles and methods, and then tell the masses (propagate), and call on the masses to implement them, solve the problems of the masses, and bring liberation and happiness to the masses." The 4676 Unit and the Military Department personnel of Lu Long County firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, often helping the Revolutionary Committee and various levels of revolutionary cadres to timely summarize the experiences of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing politics from practical struggles, discovering advanced models and experiences, and quickly promoting them. They also helped various levels of leading cadres to continuously improve their awareness of emphasizing proletarian politics through methods such as personal experiences. Under the influence of the leftist support personnel, the Lu Long County Revolutionary Committee and many grassroots units' Revolutionary Committees all placed studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing politics, and firmly grasping the ideological revolutionization of people at the forefront of all work, quickly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and powerfully promoting revolution and production. Currently, Mao Zedong Thought study classes in communes, brigades, households, and courtyards are springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain. All 35 communes in the county have established Revolutionary Committees, achieving a red tide across the county.

　　革委会工作千头万绪  突出政治就节节胜利
    解放军向卢龙县革委会传授部队政治工作经验，全县革命和生产热气腾腾
    据新华社十五日讯　人民解放军四六七六部队和河北卢龙县武装部支左人员，在县革命委员会成立后，大力向革命委员会成员和革命群众组织负责人，传授部队活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的经验，大大提高了他们突出无产阶级政治的自觉性，使全县的革命和生产出现了一派热气腾腾的景象。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，卢龙县在去年十一月成立了革命委员会。当时，事情千头万绪，有的同志不知从那里抓起。有的同志整天埋头事务工作，结果工作越抓越没有头绪。
    在卢龙县担负支左任务的人民解放军四六七六部队和武装部的同志分析了这些情况后认为，这是关系到把革命委员会建设成大立毛泽东思想的指挥部，还是降低成为单纯抓业务的领导班子的大问题；是关系到革命委员会能不能巩固和发展的大问题。他们带着问题进一步学习了毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导和林彪副主席关于突出政治和领导班子革命化的论述。县革命委员会肩负着领导全县人民大立毛泽东思想，把全县办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校的根本任务。必须无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，时时、处处、事事突出无产阶级政治，才能担负起这个任务。支左人员把帮助革委会领导成员和无产阶级革命派负责人，坚持走突出无产阶级政治的道路，作为一项极为重要的任务来抓。
    支左部队和武装部指战员首先帮助县革命委员会举办有革命干部和群众组织负责人参加的毛泽东思想学习班，组织大家认真学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导和林彪副主席有关突出无产阶级政治的论述。学习中大家愤怒控诉中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本县的一小撮代理人千方百计反对突出无产阶级政治，反对活学活用毛泽东思想的滔天罪行；一些犯错误的干部还现身说法，总结了不突出无产阶级政治，在阶级斗争中认不清方向，站不稳立场的经验教训。学习班还未结束，县革命委员会就经过认真讨论，作出了三项决议：掀起活学活用毛泽东思想、全面落实毛主席最新指示高潮的决议；改进领导作风，促进领导班子思想革命化的决议；掀起“抓革命，促生产”新高潮的决议。县革命委员会和革命群众组织领导机构都以解放军为榜样，建立了“天天读”、“讲用会”、“学习日”等制度。并且组织了由革命干部、无产阶级革命派和解放军组成的三结合毛泽东思想宣传队，深入农村大力宣传毛泽东思想，传播突出无产阶级政治的经验，狠抓毛主席最新指示的落实。
    在帮助县革委会成员提高认识的基础上，支左人员和参加三结合领导班子的部队同志，还积极深入到各级干部中去，和他们一起学习毛主席著作，在斗争实践中口传身带，传授部队坚持四个第一，突出无产阶级政治的经验。今年二月，召开全县“抓革命，促生产”誓师大会时，有些同志认为会议着重解决的是布置生产问题，只要提出指标，订出措施，就达到了目的。这时，参加县革命委员会的部队同志立即恳切地指出，毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”必须坚持突出无产阶级政治，以革命统帅生产。在部队同志的帮助下，会议着重研究了春耕生产中如何狠抓人的思想革命化，用革命带动生产等问题，把大会开成了活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，突出无产阶级政治的经验交流会。会议一结束，全县就掀起了“抓革命，促生产”的热潮。
    毛主席教导我们：“应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习，把他们的经验综合起来，成为更好的有条理的道理和办法，然后再告诉群众（宣传），并号召群众实行起来，解决群众的问题，使群众得到解放和幸福。”四六七六部队和卢龙县武装部指战员，牢记毛主席的教导，经常帮助革命委员会和各级革命干部从斗争实践中及时总结活学活用毛泽东思想，突出政治的经验，发现先进典型先进经验，迅速推广。同时还通过现身说法等方法，帮助各级领导干部不断提高突出无产阶级政治的自觉性。在支左人员的带动下，卢龙县革委会和许多基层单位的革委会，都做到把活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，狠抓人的思想革命化放在一切工作的首位，使毛主席最新指示迅速落实，有力地推动了革命和生产。目前全县社办、队办、户办、院办的毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，全县三十五个公社全部成立了革命委员会，实现了全县一片红。
