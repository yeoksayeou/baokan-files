	Protecting the Wounded with One's Body
	Eighteen-year-old Fan Qiu and the medical team were transporting wounded soldiers when they encountered a torrential downpour. Ahead of them lay a deep, fast-flowing mountain stream.

	Fan Qiu, without hesitation, jumped into the chest-deep water and, together with the medical team, carried the wounded soldiers one by one across the stream. They had just crossed the stream when enemy planes began bombing and strafing. At that moment, their only thought was: the wounded must not be injured again. So, they threw themselves onto the wounded, using their own bodies to shield them. One severely wounded soldier fainted from the shockwave of the explosion and needed a blood transfusion. Fan Qiu immediately donated her blood to the soldier. Upon regaining consciousness, the soldier excitedly said, "Once I recover, I will immediately return to the front lines, fight bravely, and make contributions for the people."

    用身体掩护伤员
    十八岁的范氏秋和救护队人员在运送伤员的途中遇上了倾盆大雨。前面横着一条山溪，溪深水急。
    范氏秋奋不顾身跳进齐胸深的水中，和救护队人员一起把伤员一个一个地背过山溪。她们刚越过山溪不久，敌机就来轰炸扫射。当时，她们想到的是：决不能让伤员们再次受伤。于是，她们扑到伤员身上，用自己的身体掩护了伤员。一位重伤员在爆炸气浪冲击下昏迷过去了，需要输血。范氏秋立即把自己的血输给了那位战士。这位重伤员苏醒过来后，激动地说：“我伤愈后，立即返回前线，英勇杀敌，为人民立功。”
