The Friendship Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, built with Chinese aid, in Tanzania recently began production in Dar es Salaam.

The Friendship Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory mainly consists of two mills with a total of 40,000 spindles and a printing and dyeing workshop. Thanks to the joint efforts and close cooperation between Chinese engineers and technicians and Tanzanian workers, the construction and installation work of the first mill was completed ahead of schedule.

Tanzania's Minister of Finance, Jamal, presided over the opening ceremony of the first mill. Jamal and Jiang Da, the Chinese economic representative in Tanzania, both spoke at the ceremony.

Many Tanzanian friends praised the textile printing and dyeing factory built with Chinese aid as "first-class in East Africa" and "completed at an astonishing speed." One worker told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "We are proud of this factory. It is the result of our joint efforts. During the construction, Chinese engineers and technicians sweated alongside us. We thank Chairman Mao, and we thank the Chinese people."
