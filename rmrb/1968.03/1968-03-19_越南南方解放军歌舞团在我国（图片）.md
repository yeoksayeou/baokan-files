In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Chinese people's revolutionary fervor as they strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary cultural warriors from the front lines of the anti-American struggle—the Vietnamese South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe—visited our country.

They brought with them the deep affection of the heroic Vietnamese people for the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and the fighting camaraderie of the Vietnamese brothers towards the Chinese people.

The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely stand together with the heroic Vietnamese people, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle to the end in the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation. We are confident that victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people.

The entire revolutionary cultural warriors of the Vietnamese South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, with boundless reverence, visited the place where the red sun rises—Shaoshan. This is a group photo of them in front of the giant statue of Chairman Mao. Each of them expressed that they would forever remember this most happy and most glorious moment.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, and your brilliant thoughts illuminate the hearts of the world's revolutionary people. The revolutionary cultural warriors of South Vietnam, after receiving the golden Mao badges, could not help but sing, "The East is Red, the sun rises, from China comes Mao Zedong..."

The photographs on this page were taken by a reporter from this newspaper.

The Vietnamese South cultural warriors, with hearts full of excitement, tightly held the precious gifts given by the Chinese people and our party—a gun. The people of South Vietnam and all the Vietnamese people can believe that your struggle is our struggle. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are determined to be the strong backbone of the Vietnamese brothers. The U.S. imperialists will be defeated! Vietnam will be victorious!

The people of South Vietnam, holding high the great banner of people's war, have dealt heavy blows to the American aggressors and achieved glorious victories. The Vietnamese people fight well! The victory of the Vietnamese people is our victory. Look! The old revolutionaries of Jinggangshan are so happy to receive the precious gift from the visiting Vietnamese South revolutionary cultural warriors—a badge of the Vietnamese South Liberation Army.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism. The Vietnamese South revolutionary cultural warriors, after receiving the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" with excitement.

When visiting the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's early revolutionary activities, the Vietnamese South revolutionary cultural warriors, with boundless reverence, observed the pen that Chairman Mao once used. This pen drew the great blueprint of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, pointing out the bright path for the world's revolutionary people to socialism and communism.
