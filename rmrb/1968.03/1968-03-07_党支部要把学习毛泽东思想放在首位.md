Party branches must prioritize the study of Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese Khrushchev maliciously defined the tasks of party branches as "studying culture," using "culture classes" to replace party small group meetings and "clubs" to replace branch meetings. This is an attempt to strip the soul from branch construction and to maliciously alter the nature of our party.

Comrade Lin Biao instructed us: "To arm the minds of the people throughout the country with Mao Zedong Thought and to insist on using Mao Zedong Thought as the banner in all work is the fundamental task of our party's political and ideological work." The fundamental task of party branches is to prioritize the study, implementation, propagation, and defense of Mao Zedong Thought, using the great Mao Zedong Thought to educate party members.

Our company's party branch, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school," has turned the company into a great school for studying Mao Zedong Thought. To foster a deep class sentiment among all company members towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, the party branch frequently organizes the entire company to study Comrade Lin Biao's most comprehensive and lofty evaluation of Mao Zedong Thought, to study heroes who have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out "bitter memories, sweet present" activities, and to conduct class struggle education. We use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, through recalling party history and military history, discussing the struggle between the two lines, and criticizing the crimes of "Left" and "Right" opportunism; through recalling family history, exposing the crimes of the private ownership system, and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's ambition to restore capitalism. We carry out the struggle against selfishness and the criticism of revisionism, smashing bourgeois ideology and establishing proletarian ideology. In this way, we continually arm party members with Mao Zedong Thought, continually strengthening party members' unlimited faith and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao. No matter where comrades go, the first thing they do is hang up the radiant portrait of Chairman Mao, letting the red sun forever illuminate their hearts. Loving Chairman Mao deeply, studying Chairman Mao's works diligently, no matter how dispersed the personnel or how difficult the tasks, ensuring that the study of Chairman Mao's works never stops. Comrades say: "Chairman Mao's works are the treasure among treasures, revolutionaries cannot do without them, studying them diligently at all times, only then can the revolution be successful."

The facts have proven that only by prioritizing the study of Mao Zedong Thought in all work can party organizations make Communist Party members into vigorous and brave vanguard fighters. We must smash the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to alter the nature of the party, building party branches into strongholds that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, leading the masses in fighting against class enemies.

    党支部要把学习毛泽东思想放在首位
    某部坦克四连指导员　王跃宗
    中国赫鲁晓夫别有用心地把党支部的任务规定为“学文化”，用什么“文化班”来代替党小组会，用什么“俱乐部”来代替支部大会。这是企图抽掉支部建设的灵魂，妄图篡改我们党的性质。
    林副主席指示我们：“用毛泽东思想武装全国人民的头脑，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，是我党政治思想工作最根本的任务。”党支部最根本的任务就是要把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想放在首位，用伟大的毛泽东思想教育党员。
    我们连队党支部遵照伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大指示，把连队办成学习毛泽东思想的大学校。为了使全连同志对毛主席、对毛泽东思想有深厚的阶级感情，党支部经常组织全连学习林副主席对毛泽东思想最全面、最崇高的评价，学习用毛泽东思想哺育成长起来的英雄人物，开展忆苦思甜活动，进行阶级斗争的教育。我们以毛泽东思想为武器，通过忆党史、军史，谈两条路线的斗争，批判“左”右倾机会主义的罪行；通过忆家史，揭发私有制度的罪恶，批判中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的野心。我们开展斗私批修，大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想。这样不断用毛泽东思想武装党员，就不断增强党员对伟大统帅毛主席的无限信仰，无限崇拜。同志们不论到那里，第一件大事首先是挂起金光闪闪的毛主席像，让红太阳永远照亮自己的心坎。对毛主席爱得深，毛主席著作学得勤，不管人员多么分散，任务多么困难，做到学习毛主席著作始终不间断。同志们说：“毛主席著作是宝中宝，革命战士离不了，时刻学习不放松，革命才能搞得好。”
    事实证明，党的组织只有把学习毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，才能使共产党员成为朝气蓬勃、勇敢战斗的先锋战士。我们一定要粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫篡改党的性质的阴谋，把党支部建设成无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，成为领导群众向阶级敌人进行战斗的坚强堡垒。
