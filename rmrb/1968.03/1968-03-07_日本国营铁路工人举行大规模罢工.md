Japanese national railway workers began a four-hour strike at midnight on the 2nd across the country. The strike was organized to protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and to oppose the dismissal of railway workers.

This strike dealt a powerful blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. By noon on the 2nd, hundreds of trains had stopped running in various parts of Japan, many locomotive depots were paralyzed, and all national railway operations were in chaos. Railway workers held meetings and demonstrations in various locations, chanting slogans such as "Oppose the dismissal of 50,000 workers," "Oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam," "Do not transport oil for the U.S. military," "Overthrow the Sato government," and "Abolish U.S. military bases." They also posted leaflets on many buildings and trains of the national railway.

    日本国营铁路工人举行大规模罢工
    日本国营铁路工人二日零时起在全国各地举行了四个小时的罢工，反对美帝国主义侵略越南和反对解雇铁路工人。
    这次罢工给美日反动派以有力打击。到二日中午，日本各地国营铁路已有四百列列车停驶，很多机务段瘫痪，所有的国营铁路运行陷入混乱。铁路工人在各地召开会议，举行示威游行，高呼“反对解雇五万工人”、“反对美帝国主义侵略越南”、“不给美军运输汽油”、“打倒佐藤政府”、“取消美军基地”等口号。他们还在国营铁路局的许多建筑物和列车上张贴了传单。
