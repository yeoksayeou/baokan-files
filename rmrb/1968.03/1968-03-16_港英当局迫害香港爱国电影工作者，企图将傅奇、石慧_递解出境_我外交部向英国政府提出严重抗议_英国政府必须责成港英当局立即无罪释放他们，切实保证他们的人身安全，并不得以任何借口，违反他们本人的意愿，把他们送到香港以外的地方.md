The British authorities in Hong Kong are persecuting Hong Kong patriotic film workers and attempting to "expel" Fu Qi and Shi Hui.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has lodged a serious protest with the British government.

The British government must order the British authorities in Hong Kong to immediately release them without charge, ensure their personal safety, and under no pretext, against their will, send them to places outside Hong Kong.

BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The responsible official of the Western Europe Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China summoned British Charge d'Affaires Hopson this evening to lodge a serious protest with the British government over the British authorities in Hong Kong's attempt to "expel" the patriotic film workers Fu Qi and Shi Hui.

The official said that at noon on March 14, the British authorities in Hong Kong forcibly took Fu Qi and Shi Hui, who had been illegally detained in a concentration camp, to the Luohu Bridge, attempting to "expel" them. This is another act of persecution by the British authorities in Hong Kong against our compatriots residing and working in Hong Kong.

The official pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong must understand that our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have the sacred right to reside and work in Hong Kong, and this right cannot be taken away by anyone. The British authorities in Hong Kong have been persecuting our patriotic compatriots, and now, instead of releasing them without charge, they are using trumped-up charges to forcibly "expel" them against their will. This is utterly unreasonable. I am now instructed to lodge a serious protest with the British government.

The official sternly pointed out that your new persecution of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong will only arouse strong indignation among our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the local people on the border, and thus reignite tensions within Hong Kong and on the border.

The official finally said that I am instructed to declare that the Chinese government has always provided convenience for Chinese residents in Hong Kong to travel freely between Hong Kong and the mainland, but firmly opposes the British authorities in Hong Kong forcibly "expelling" our patriotic compatriots, regardless of where they are expelled to. The British government must immediately stop the British authorities in Hong Kong from taking such unreasonable actions and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. At the same time, the Chinese government demands that the British government order the British authorities in Hong Kong to immediately release Fu Qi and Shi Hui without charge, restore their personal freedom, not persecute them in any way, ensure their personal safety, and under no pretext, against their will, send them to places outside Hong Kong. Otherwise, the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong must bear all the consequences that arise from this.

HONG KONG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- On March 14, the British authorities in Hong Kong used violence to forcibly take the patriotic film workers Fu Qi and Shi Hui to the Luohu Bridge, attempting to "expel" them. Fu Qi and Shi Hui put up a firm and heroic struggle with the British authorities at the Luohu Bridge and angrily exposed the British authorities' persecution of them.

Fu Qi and Shi Hui were illegally abducted by the British authorities in Hong Kong on July 15 last year and have been detained in the Ma On Shan concentration camp in Hong Kong. For eight months, the British authorities have repeatedly threatened to "expel" them. On the morning of March 14, when the political department officials of the British authorities used violence to abduct them onto a car and leave the concentration camp, they immediately protested strongly to the British officials and repeatedly shouted, "Protest against the British authorities' illegal expulsion!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Other patriotic compatriots detained in the concentration camp also strongly supported them, protesting strongly against the British authorities' fascist atrocities. When Fu Qi and Shi Hui were forcibly pushed onto the Luohu Bridge, they once again expressed their firm refusal to leave and pointed out sternly: Hong Kong has been Chinese territory since ancient times, and the Chinese people have the sacred and inviolable right to reside, work, study, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought here. To thwart the British authorities' plot to further persecute patriotic compatriots through illegal "expulsion," Fu Qi and Shi Hui insisted on fighting on the bridge. They repeatedly shouted slogans and sang revolutionary songs, exposing to the travelers crossing the border the British authorities' fascist persecution. Their struggle won the warm praise and firm support of their compatriots. Until late at night on March 14, they were still insisting on fighting on the bridge. In the evening, the British authorities dispatched more police and military to Luohu to create a tense atmosphere.

That afternoon, the representative of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch strongly protested to the British political advisor Ireaw this in person and pointed out that the British authorities' attempt to "expel" Fu Qi and Shi Hui is entirely unreasonable. Fu Qi and Shi Hui, along with other patriotic compatriots detained in the concentration camp, should be released immediately. If the British authorities insist on forcibly expelling them, they must bear all the consequences that arise from this.

The Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee of the Longshan Film Production Company issued a statement on the same day, strongly protesting against the British authorities' plot to illegally "expel" Fu Qi and Shi Hui.

　　港英当局迫害香港爱国电影工作者，企图将傅奇、石慧“递解出境”
　　我外交部向英国政府提出严重抗议
　　英国政府必须责成港英当局立即无罪释放他们，切实保证他们的人身安全，并不得以任何借口，违反他们本人的意愿，把他们送到香港以外的地方
    新华社十五日讯　我国外交部西欧司负责人今晚召见英国驻中国代办霍普森，就香港英国当局企图将香港爱国电影工作者傅奇、石慧“递解出境”的迫害行为，奉命向英国政府提出严重抗议。
    西欧司负责人说，三月十四日中午，香港英国当局将被无理监禁在集中营的爱国电影工作者傅奇、石慧二人，强行押到罗湖桥头，企图把他们“递解出境”。这是香港英国当局对我居住和工作在港九的爱国同胞的又一次迫害措施。
    西欧司负责人指出，香港英国当局必须明白，我香港爱国同胞有在香港居住和工作的神圣权利，这一权利不容任何人剥夺。香港英国当局对我爱国同胞肆加迫害，现在不但不把他们无罪释放，反而以莫须有的罪名，违反其本人意志，把他们强行“递解出境”，这是毫无道理的。我现在奉命向英国政府提出严重抗议。
    西欧司负责人严正指出，你们对我香港爱国同胞进行这种新的迫害，只能激起香港爱国同胞和边境当地群众的强烈愤慨，并从而重新引起香港内部和边境上的紧张局面。
    西欧司负责人最后说，我奉命声明，中国政府一向给予香港中国居民在香港和祖国间自由往来的便利，但坚决反对香港英国当局把我香港爱国同胞强行“递解出境”，不论递解到什么地方都不行。英国政府必须立即制止香港英国当局的这种无理做法，切实保证今后不再发生类似事件。同时，中国政府要求英国政府责成香港英国当局立即无罪释放傅奇、石慧二人，恢复他们的人身自由，不得对他们进行任何迫害，切实保证他们的人身安全，并不得以任何借口，违反他们本人的意愿，把他们二人送到香港以外的地方。否则，英国政府和香港英国当局必须承担由此而产生的一切后果。
    新华社香港十五日电　港英当局十四日用暴力把香港爱国电影工作者傅奇、石慧夫妇非法押解到罗湖桥头，企图把他们“递解出境”。傅奇、石慧在罗湖桥头坚持和港英当局进行坚决的和英勇的斗争，并愤怒揭露港英当局对他们进行迫害的罪行。
    傅奇、石慧是在去年七月十五日被港英当局非法绑架的，一直被拘留在香港摩星岭集中营。八个月来，港英当局不断对他们进行威胁，要把他们“递解出境”。三月十四日清早，当港英政治部官员用暴力把他们绑架上汽车离开集中营时，他们立即向港英官员提出强烈抗议，并不断高呼：“抗议港英当局非法递解出境！”“毛主席万岁！”被拘留在集中营的其他爱国同胞也纷纷声援他们，强烈抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行。傅奇、石慧在被强行推上罗湖桥时，再次表示坚决拒绝离境，并且严正指出：香港自古以来就是中国的领土，中国人民有在这里居住、工作以及学习和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣不可侵犯的权利。为了击破港英当局用非法“递解出境”的办法进一步迫害爱国同胞的阴谋，傅奇、石慧坚持在桥头上进行斗争。他们不断高呼口号，高唱革命歌曲，向进出边境的旅客控诉和揭露港英当局的法西斯迫害。他们的斗争得到同胞们的热烈赞扬和坚决支持。直到十四日深夜，他们还坚持在桥头上。傍晚，港英当局加派军警在罗湖布防，制造紧张空气。
    当天下午，新华社香港分社代表向港英政治顾问伊理觉当面提出强烈抗议，并指出：港英当局把傅奇、石慧二人“递解出境”是毫无理由的。傅奇、石慧二人和其他被拘留在集中营的爱国同胞应该立即释放，如果港英当局竟想强押他们出境，那就必须负起由此而产生的一切后果。
    傅奇、石慧二人所在的长城电影制片公司的反对港英迫害斗争委员会在同一天发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局阴谋把傅奇、石慧非法“递解出境”。
