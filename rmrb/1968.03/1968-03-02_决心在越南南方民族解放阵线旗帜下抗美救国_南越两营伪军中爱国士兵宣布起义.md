	Determined to fight against America and save the country under the banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, patriotic soldiers in two camps of the puppet army in South Vietnam announce their uprising.

	Hanoi, March 28 — According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, patriotic soldiers from the 2nd Battalion and the 31st Special Forces Battalion of the 5th Division of the puppet army stationed in the northern part of Binh Dinh Province in South Vietnam issued a statement on the 20th, announcing their withdrawal from the Saigon puppet regime. They declared their determination to fight against America and save the country under the banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

	The statement said that the American aggressors have committed heinous crimes on Vietnamese soil. Their true colors of aggression have been fully exposed. The traitorous group of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky is nothing but a bunch of criminals who bring disaster to the country and the people. The Americans and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky group are our people's sworn enemies.

	The statement said that the struggle led by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam against the American-Thieu group is completely just because it serves the interests of the entire nation. The current unprecedented, all-out, and fierce offensive launched by various revolutionary forces led by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam against the American-Thieu group will surely achieve a thorough victory. The days of the American-Thieu group are numbered.

	The statement further said, "We declare: We withdraw from the puppet army of the Saigon regime and resolutely get rid of the life of being mercenaries; we establish the Association of Patriotic Uprising Soldiers and fight under the banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam against the American-Thieu group."

	The statement appealed to the officers and soldiers of the 5th Division of the puppet army and to the enemy forces in this province to recognize the situation early, turn their guns around, and eliminate the American aggressors and their lackeys.

    决心在越南南方民族解放阵线旗帜下抗美救国
    南越两营伪军中爱国士兵宣布起义
    新华社河内二十八日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：驻扎在越南南方边和省北部的伪军第五师第二营和第三十一别动营的爱国士兵，二十日发表一项声明，宣布脱离西贡伪政权，并且决心在越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜下，进行抗美救国斗争。
    声明说，美国侵略者在越南的土地上犯下了滔天罪行。他们的侵略原形已经暴露无遗了。而越奸阮文绍—阮高其集团，只不过是祸国殃民的歹徒。美国佬和阮文绍—阮高其集团是我国同胞不共戴天的敌人。
    声明说，越南南方人民在民族解放阵线领导下进行的反对美阮集团的斗争，是完全正义的。因为它符合全民族的利益。由越南南方民族解放阵线领导的各种革命力量目前向美阮集团发动的空前的、全面和猛烈的进攻，必将取得彻底的胜利。美阮集团崩溃的日子不远了。
    声明接着说，我们声明：脱离西贡伪政权军队，坚决摆脱当雇佣军的生活；成立起义爱国士兵协会，在越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜下，进行反对美阮集团的战斗。
    声明呼吁伪军第五师的官兵和在这个省的敌人队伍中的官兵，及早认清形势，掉转枪口，消灭美国佬和走狗恶棍。
