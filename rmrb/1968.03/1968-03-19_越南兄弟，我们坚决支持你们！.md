	Vietnamese brothers, we firmly support you!
	Beijing Postage Stamp Factory Revolutionary Committee

	“Down with American imperialism!” “American imperialism, get out!” Eighteen years ago today, the Vietnamese people roared on the banks of the Saigon River.

	On March 19, 1950, Saigon-Cholon saw a massive anti-American demonstration with tens of thousands of people. They protested against American imperialism sending two destroyers and aircraft from an aircraft carrier to provoke the Vietnamese people madly. This struggle was overwhelming, frightening the arrogant American bandits into a panic. The American imperialist warships were finally forced to retreat with their tails between their legs. The Vietnamese people opened the curtain on their struggle against American imperialism and achieved their first victory.

	Over the past eighteen years, American imperialism has escalated from armed intervention to direct aggression against the Vietnamese people, and has been steadily expanding. They attempted to use force to subjugate the Vietnamese people and realize their ambition to occupy South Vietnam. However, the Vietnamese people are a heroic people with a glorious anti-imperialist tradition. They united as one, fighting against the enemy, and launched a brave battle against the American aggressors, achieving continuous glorious victories. Recently, the South Vietnamese people's Tet Offensive has struck this most vicious imperialist to the point of utter defeat and disarray, opening a new phase in the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism. Now, the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism is no longer a question of whether they can win or not, nor is it a question of big victories or small victories. It is a definite victory, and they have already achieved great victories. The day when American imperialism will be driven out of Vietnam is not far off.

	The victory of the Vietnamese people is a great victory of revolutionary heroism. The heroic Vietnamese people are brave and unyielding, daring to defy American imperialism, this “giant,” daring to confront it directly, and finally achieving today's great situation. The Vietnamese people's spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win is worth our deep study.

	The victory of the Vietnamese people is a great victory of people's war. The heroic Vietnamese people have mobilized broadly, persisted in long-term warfare, and creatively applied the strategies and tactics of people's war. They have turned their weaknesses into strengths, turned passivity into initiative, and plunged the fully modernized more than fifty thousand American aggressors into a disaster. The precious experience of the Vietnamese people's war is worth our deep study.

	All the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Postage Stamp Factory, with the boundless affection of comrades and brothers, have designed and printed a large number of stamps reflecting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism over the past few years. These millions of stamps have proclaimed to the people of the world the heroic struggle and great victories of the Vietnamese people, expressing the Chinese people's resolute support for the Vietnamese people.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao said: “Seven hundred million Chinese people are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people.” Chairman Mao's mighty voice, resonating across the five continents, expresses the resolute will of the seven hundred million Chinese people to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism. We, the Chinese working class of the Mao Zedong era, always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings and have always regarded the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism as our own struggle. We are determined to exert our greatest efforts, with practical actions to support our Vietnamese brothers until the Vietnamese people thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

	Just as the great leader of the Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh, pointed out: “The closer to victory, the more difficulties will arise. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will struggle more fiercely.” But American imperialism, no matter what means it uses, cannot save itself from failure. Vietnamese comrades, the final victory is in sight! As long as you strengthen your unity, persist in the struggle, fight fiercely, and fight continuously, the national struggle against American imperialism that began eighteen years ago will surely achieve the final victory.

	The Vietnamese people will win! American imperialism will be defeated!

　　越南兄弟，我们坚决支持你们！
　　北京邮票厂革命委员会
    “打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义滚回去！”十八年前的今天，越南人民在西贡河畔发出了震天的吼声。
    一九五○年三月十九日，西贡—堤岸爆发了数十万人的声势浩大的反美示威，抗议美帝国主义派遣两艘驱逐舰和从航空母舰上出动飞机向越南人民进行疯狂挑衅。这一斗争波涛汹涌，把耀武扬威的美国强盗吓的慌作一团。美帝的军舰终于被迫夹着尾巴溜走了。越南人民揭开了抗美救国斗争的序幕，取得了第一次胜利。
    十八年来，美帝国主义对越南人民从武装干涉到直接发动侵略战争，并且步步扩大，妄图用武力迫使越南人民屈服，实现其霸占越南南方的野心。但是，越南人民是有着光荣反帝斗争传统的英雄人民。他们同仇敌忾，万众一心，向美国侵略者展开了英勇的战斗，并且不断取得辉煌的胜利。最近越南南方人民的新春出击，把这个最凶恶的帝国主义打得一败涂地，狼狈不堪，打开了越南人民抗美救国战争的新局面。现在，越南人民的抗美救国战争，已经不是能不能胜利的问题，也不是大胜小胜的问题，而是确定无疑地要胜利，并且已经取得了伟大的胜利。美帝国主义滚出越南的日子不会很远了。
    越南人民的胜利，是革命英雄主义的伟大胜利。英雄的越南人民英勇顽强，不畏强暴，敢于藐视美帝国主义这个“庞然大物”，敢于同它直接较量，终于打出了今天这样的大好形势。越南人民这种敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，值得我们很好地学习。
    越南人民的胜利，是人民战争的伟大胜利。英雄的越南人民广泛动员起来，坚持长期作战，创造性地运用了人民战争的战略战术，以己之长，攻敌之短，变劣势为优势，变被动为主动，使全副现代化装备的五十多万美国侵略军陷入了灭顶之灾。越南人民战争的宝贵经验，值得我们很好地学习。
    我们北京邮票厂的全体革命职工，怀着战友和兄弟的无限深情，几年来设计和印制了大量反映越南人民抗美救国战争的邮票。这千千万万张邮票，向世界各国人民宣扬了越南人民的英勇斗争和伟大胜利，表达了中国人民坚决支援越南人民的坚强决心。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”毛主席响彻五洲四海的伟大声音，表达了七亿中国人民支持越南人民抗美救国战争的坚强决心。我们，毛泽东时代的中国工人阶级，牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，一向把越南人民的抗美救国战争看成是自己的斗争。我们决心尽自己的最大力量，以实际行动来支援越南兄弟，直至越南人民彻底打败美国侵略者。
    正象越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席指出的：“越接近胜利，困难将会越多。敌人就象一头走投无路的野兽，将更加疯狂地挣扎。”但是美帝国主义用任何办法都不能挽救它的失败。越南战友们，最后胜利在望了！只要加强团结，坚持战斗，狠狠地打，连续地打，十八年前开始的越南全国抗美救国斗争，就一定能够夺得最后的胜利。
    越南人民必胜！美帝国主义必败！
