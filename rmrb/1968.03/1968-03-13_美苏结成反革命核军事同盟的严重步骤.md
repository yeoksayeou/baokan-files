The US imperialists and the Soviet revisionists, after long-term collusion, jointly proposed an agreement at the Geneva "disarmament" conference on March 7, in collusion with British imperialism, announcing that they would provide so-called "nuclear protection" to "non-nuclear countries" that sign the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty." This is another serious step in the formation of a nuclear military alliance between the US and the Soviet revisionists for their intensified global collusion against China, against communism, and against the people.

The agreement between the US and the Soviet revisionists uses the despicable trick of the thief crying "stop thief." They attempt to portray the US imperialists, who have consistently used nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats against the peoples of the world, as the "protectors" of world peace. They slander socialist China, which develops nuclear weapons for self-defense and to safeguard world peace, as the source of "nuclear threats." They also attempt to use this so-called "nuclear protection" to embolden reactionary elements like the Indian reactionaries, who are anti-China, to engage in even more frenzied anti-China activities. The Soviet revisionist traitors have publicly declared through this counter-revolutionary act that the world's number one enemy, US imperialism, is their closest "ally." The joint provision of so-called "nuclear protection" to "non-nuclear countries" by the US and the Soviet revisionists once again exposes the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist traitors as the chief accomplices of US imperialism.

What is this "nuclear protection"? In the past, imperialists and colonialists used gunboats to "protect" weak countries. Now, the US and the Soviet revisionists want to use nuclear weapons to "protect" non-nuclear countries. Isn't this a typical imperialist policy of banditry?

It is the US and the Soviet revisionists themselves who refuse to give up the use of nuclear weapons and collude to use nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats against the peoples of the world. Now they turn around and claim to provide "nuclear protection" to other countries. Isn't this the height of shamelessness?

The US and the Soviet revisionists use this so-called "nuclear protection" to force non-nuclear countries in the world to join the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" they have plotted. This is a sinister plot to control and enslave those non-nuclear countries and turn their peoples into nuclear slaves. They attempt to use their nuclear weapons to turn the "non-nuclear countries" in the world into their "protectorates." If this plot succeeds, then all non-nuclear countries that join the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" will not only be permanently unable to possess nuclear weapons to resist the nuclear threats of the US and the Soviet revisionists, but they will also have no right to oppose the development, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons by the US and the Soviet revisionists. They will only be able to meekly submit to the US and the Soviet revisionists manipulating their fate.

All countries in the world, regardless of size or whether they have nuclear weapons, should be treated equally. The very proposal of so-called "nuclear protection" is an insult to the dignity of all non-nuclear countries and an interference in the sovereignty of non-nuclear countries. All countries that cherish their independence and sovereignty will see through this plot of the US and the Soviet revisionists. All truly peace-loving countries and peoples in the world resolutely oppose the "nuclear protection" of the US and the Soviet revisionists.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs that the US imperialists have in their hands are no scarecrow." Whether it is the nuclear weapons of US imperialism or the nuclear weapons of the Soviet revisionists, they absolutely cannot frighten the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and they absolutely cannot stop the great tide of the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of the world. The nuclear blackmail and nuclear threat policies of the US and the Soviet revisionists have already failed and will definitely suffer a complete failure.

The Chinese people and the Chinese government have always advocated the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and resolutely oppose the monopoly of nuclear weapons by big powers, threatening other countries. China's development of nuclear weapons is precisely to oppose the collusion of the US and the Soviet revisionists in implementing nuclear monopoly, nuclear blackmail, and nuclear threats, with the ultimate goal of completely eliminating nuclear weapons. We have repeatedly solemnly declared that under any circumstances, China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. China's possession of nuclear weapons is a great encouragement to all revolutionary peoples of the world and a great contribution to world peace. The Chinese people and the Chinese government will unswervingly join with all peace-loving countries and peoples of the world to fight to the end to smash the nuclear threats and nuclear blackmail of the US and the Soviet revisionists, and to achieve the lofty goal of completely prohibiting and thoroughly destroying nuclear weapons!

　　美苏结成反革命核军事同盟的严重步骤
　　本报评论员
    美帝国主义和苏修集团经过长期密谋，三月七日在日内瓦“裁军”会议上，伙同英帝国主义联合抛出了一项协议，宣布它们将对参加签订所谓“防止核扩散条约”的“非核国家”提供所谓“核保护”。这是美帝苏修为了加紧反华、反共、反人民的反革命全球性勾结而公开结成核军事同盟的又一个严重步骤。
    美帝苏修的这个协议，使用了贼喊捉贼的无耻伎俩。它们妄图把一贯对世界人民进行核讹诈和核威胁的美帝国主义装扮成世界和平的“保护者”，而把为了进行自卫和保卫世界和平而发展核武器的社会主义中国诬蔑为“核威胁”的来源。它们还妄图用这种提供“核保护”的手段，来给印度反动派等反华的走卒打气，嗾使这些走卒更加疯狂地进行反华活动。苏修叛徒集团用这个反革命行动公开宣告：全世界人民的死敌美帝国主义是它的最亲密的“盟友”。美苏联合对“非核国家”提供所谓“核保护”，又一次暴露了苏修叛徒集团作为美帝国主义头号帮凶的狰狞嘴脸。
    什么“核保护”？帝国主义和殖民主义过去用炮舰对弱小国家进行“保护”，现在美帝苏修要用核武器对无核国家进行“保护”，这不是典型的帝国主义的强盗政策吗？
    明明是美帝苏修自己不肯放弃使用核武器，勾结起来对全世界人民进行核讹诈和核威胁，现在反过来还叫嚷要对别的国家进行“核保护”，这不是无耻之极吗？
    美帝苏修利用所谓“核保护”，硬要把世界上的无核国家拖下水，参加它们所策划的“防止核扩散条约”。这是一个控制和奴役那些无核国家，把那些国家的人民变成它们的核奴隶的一个险恶阴谋。它们妄图凭着自己手里的核武器，把世界上的“非核国家”变成它们的“保护国”。如果这个阴谋得逞，那末，一切参加“防止核扩散条约”的无核国家，就不仅自己永远不能拥有核武器，以抵抗美帝苏修的核威胁，并且将无权反对美帝苏修发展、储存和使用核武器，而只能俯首帖耳地听任美帝苏修摆布它们的命运。
    世界各国不论大小，不论有没有核武器，都应当一律平等。提出所谓“核保护”本身，就是对一切无核国家的尊严的侮辱，就是干涉无核国家的主权。一切珍视自己独立和主权的国家，都会识破美帝苏修的这个阴谋诡计。全世界真正爱好和平的国家和人民，坚决反对美帝苏修的“核保护”。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“美帝国主义手里的原子弹、氢弹，是吓不倒一切不愿意做奴隶的人们的。”不管是美帝国主义的核武器也罢，苏修集团的核武器也罢，都绝不能吓倒亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国的革命人民，绝对阻挡不了全世界人民反帝革命斗争的巨大洪流。美帝苏修的核讹诈和核威胁政策，已经遭到破产，而且一定要遭到彻底的破产。
    中国人民和中国政府一贯主张全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器，坚决反对大国垄断核武器，威胁其他国家。中国发展核武器，正是为了反对美苏勾结实行核垄断、核讹诈和核威胁，最终目的是要彻底消灭核武器。我们曾一再郑重地宣布，在任何时候，任何情况下，中国都不会首先使用核武器。中国掌握了核武器，是对全世界革命人民的巨大鼓舞，是对世界和平的伟大贡献。中国人民和中国政府坚持不渝地同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民一道，为共同粉碎美帝苏修的核威胁和核讹诈，为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的崇高目标而斗争到底！
