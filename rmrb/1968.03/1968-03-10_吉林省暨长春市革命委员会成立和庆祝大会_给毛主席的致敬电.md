	To Our Most Beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao:

	In the midst of the excellent spring weather as we fully implement Your latest directives, and amidst the drumbeats of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Revolutionary Committee of Jilin Province has been born! The Revolutionary Committee of Changchun City has been born!

	This is a great victory for Your brilliant thoughts!

	This is a resounding triumph for Your proletarian revolutionary line!

	This is a magnificent achievement of the People's Liberation Army in their "three supports, two militaries" work!

	With boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, we joyfully report to You—our most red, most red red sun in our hearts—our good news! Good news! Good news!

	In the Changbai Mountains, spring comes early, and by the Songhua River, everything is in full bloom. Today, from the green forests in the east to the golden prairies in the west, from the industrial cities with roaring machinery to the vast farmlands producing soybeans and sorghum, the mountains are cheering and the waters are laughing, with waves of red flags and surging songs. The 17 million heroes of all ethnic groups, who are infinitely loyal to You, hold up the red book, face the golden Beijing, with tears of joy streaming down, and shout with all their might: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The heavens and the earth are not as great as Your kindness. Parents are not as dear as You.

	It is You who, with far-sighted vision, creatively proposed the entire set of theories, lines, policies, and guidelines for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. You personally initiated and led this unprecedented, world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, opening a new era in the international communist movement.

	It is You who personally wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," issuing the great order to march forward. The billion military and civilian people of the nation, with the force of a thousand thunderbolts and the momentum of overturning mountains, smashed the headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by China's Khrushchev.

	It is Your great teaching, "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," that inspired us to raise high the banner of proletarian revolutionary rebellion. We broke out of the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, exposed China's Khrushchev's agent and great traitor Zhao Lin and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, defeating them thoroughly and completely, and their evil plot to restore capitalism was utterly ruined.

	It is the great People's Liberation Army of China, created and led by You and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, that, at the crucial moment of life-and-death struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, firmly and unanimously supported the proletarian revolutionary masses. They stood shoulder to shoulder with us, heart to heart, sharing the same breath and destiny. The great People's Liberation Army of China is the most steadfast rear guard of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

	The series of extremely important latest directives from the proletarian headquarters led by You for the Cultural Revolution in Jilin Province fully reflect Your deep concern for the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses.

	Your series of extremely important latest directives are like timely rain, nourishing our hearts; like a lighthouse shining brightly, illuminating our path forward. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprouted up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Everywhere, battlefields of criticizing revisionism and repudiating selfishness are set up. We hold high the banner of the proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev; strengthening proletarian party spirit, overcoming bourgeois, petty-bourgeois factionalism, and anarchism. We fully carry out the "four greats," and according to Your policy on cadres, we have conducted mass investigations of cadres, promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which victory is not the crystallization of Your brilliant thoughts?! Which triumphant song is not composed by Your revolutionary line?!

	We will never forget that it was Your wise leadership in the great victory of the Anti-Japanese War that saved us from the depths of misery.

	We will never forget that it was Your close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, who held high the great banner of Your military thought, "established a solid Northeast base," led the people to fight three times south of the river, defended Lianjiang four times, and fought fiercely in Liaoshen, liberating Changchun and accelerating the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek regime.

	We will never forget that fifteen years ago, You personally wrote the eleven golden words "First Automobile Manufacturing Plant Foundation Memorial," illuminating our splendid future of large-scale socialist construction.

	We will never forget that ten years ago in the spring, a thousand beams of golden light shone over the spring city. You traveled thousands of miles, full of vigor, and came among us. Your warm care and great teachings inspired us to launch the surging waves of the Great Leap Forward, and the red flag of the general line for socialist construction flew high.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Looking at today, recalling the past, and gazing into the future, we have forged an unshakable conviction: Navigating the great sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought!

	Relying on Your thoughts, our great socialist state stands tall and prosperous;

	Relying on Your thoughts, our great Communist Party of China holds high the banner of proletarian revolution, unyielding and invincible;

	Relying on Your thoughts, our great people are full of spirit and fighting vigor;

	Relying on Your thoughts, our great army is like an iron wall, unparalleled in the world.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Following You is the direction! Following You is victory! We will forever be loyal to You, forever loyal to Your brilliant thoughts, forever loyal to Your revolutionary line. We will resolutely take Vice Chairman Lin as our great example, read Your books, listen to Your words, and act according to Your directives. We vow to turn Jilin Province into a blazing red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	We are determined to raise high the great red banner of Your thoughts, to fully implement Your latest directives, to emphasize proletarian politics, to conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to let Your boundless thoughts spread for ten thousand generations! Let our proletarian iron-clad state remain red for all generations!

	We will resolutely respond to Your great call, criticize selfishness, repudiate revisionism, further carry out the great criticism, consolidate and develop the great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," rectify our units and departments, strengthen the party's organization, and carry out the movement of supporting the army and loving the people. We will strengthen military-civilian unity, promote revolution, production, work, and preparedness, and do a better job in all aspects to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	We will always remember Your great teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold. We will guard against sabotage and disruption by domestic and foreign enemies, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, defend the proletarian revolutionary power, and safeguard our great socialist motherland.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The world has entered a new era with Your thoughts as the great banner. You are the greatest genius of the contemporary proletariat. You are the lighthouse of the international communist movement. You are the eternal red sun in the hearts of the people of the world. We will forever cherish our motherland in our hearts and look at the global situation, facing the thunderous winds of the world revolution, closely following You, marching towards the brilliant future of communism.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The Changbai Mountains and Zhongnanhai are thousands of miles apart, but the 17 million heroic sons and daughters have their red hearts closely connected with Yours. The light of the red sun shines over the world, and we fight day and night by Your side! The blue waves of the Songhua River flow for a thousand miles, and we cannot express our boundless admiration and love for You; the pine trees of the Changbai Mountains roar for ten thousand generations, and we cannot sing enough of our boundless loyalty and adoration for You. We shout a thousand times, we sing a thousand times: We wish You—our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman—eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

      我们永远也不能忘记，十五年前，您亲笔写的“第一汽车制造厂奠基纪念”十一个金光闪闪的大字，照耀着我们大规模社会主义建设的锦绣前程。
      我们永远也不能忘记，十年前的春天，万道金光照春城。您千里迢迢，神采奕奕，来到我们中间。您亲切的关怀，伟大的教导，鼓舞着我们掀起大跃进的滚滚热浪，社会主义建设总路线的红旗高高飘扬。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！看今朝，忆过去，展望未来，我们凝结成一个最最坚定的信念：大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想！
