Refuting the "Public-Private Fusion" Theory of the Chinese Khrushchev

	Air Force Hero Squadron Commander Dong Xiaohai

The Chinese Khrushchev absurdly claims that a "good party member" should "treat public property as if it were his own and work diligently and responsibly on the party's public tasks as if they were his own." This is a reactionary "public-private fusion" theory, a poisonous opium that corrupts the minds of party members.

How does one become a good Communist Party member? Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, loyal, active, and put revolutionary interests above all else, subordinating personal interests to revolutionary interests"; "He should be selfless and have no selfish motives."

Chairman Mao's requirements for a Communist Party member are selflessness, public-spiritedness, and placing revolutionary interests above everything else. The great communist warrior Lei Feng is forever in people's hearts and serves as a shining example to inspire us because he "had the whole people in his heart, but not himself." The comrades in our squadron follow Chairman Mao's teachings, taking "Three Articles" as our motto, striving for a spirit of selflessness, and treating "selfishness" as a target to shoot at every day. Everyone voluntarily exposes and shoots at this target, effectively promoting the revolutionization of our thoughts. Comrades say: We fight to defend Chairman Mao and are ready to die for him. We are prepared to shed our blood in the sky and write a red "loyalty" with our blood. For more than ten years, we have relied on a red heart and Mao Zedong Thought to shoot down and damage one enemy plane after another.

A Communist Party member should have only the party's cause, the revolutionary cause, the people, and the great leader Chairman Mao in his heart, with no room for himself. Only then can he make the proper contribution to the revolution in his ordinary work; only then can he have the greatest courage, wisdom, and strength in battle. Young Communist Party member and wingman pilot Liu Yecao, during a formation flight, encountered an unexpected situation where the engine stopped due to fuel exhaustion upon landing. In this critical moment, a second earlier meant more safety; a second later meant more danger of death. At this crucial juncture of life and death, Liu Yecao remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "selflessness and serving others," and continued to follow behind his comrades, gliding. To avoid interfering with the commander's instructions and to give his comrades more opportunities to report the flight status, he chose not to speak and let his comrades use the radio more. The plane could no longer glide, but Liu Yecao still did not leave the combat weapon entrusted to him by Chairman Mao. After his comrades landed safely, he calmly and decisively performed an emergency landing, demonstrating the noble qualities of a Communist Party member nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, and with an unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao, wrote a triumphant song of "loyalty" with his actions! This gave the Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of selfish individualism a resounding slap in the face.

Public and private are the thoughts of the two opposing classes, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and cannot be "fused." To serve the public, one must abandon the private; to care for the private, one must harm the public. If a Communist Party member is always concerned about personal matters and puts "me" above everything else, he will not be able to dedicate himself to the cause of the proletariat and will certainly lack the spirit of self-sacrifice.

The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously promotes the "public-private fusion" theory to party members, with malicious intent. If we fall for his tricks, we will head down the dangerous path of struggling for personal gain. We Communist Party members must use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, thoroughly criticize and eliminate the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party line, completely purge its poison, study and apply Chairman Mao's works extensively, and firmly establish a communist worldview of selflessness. We must become steadfast warriors who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

### 斥中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化”论

    斥中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化”论
    航空兵英雄中队中队长　董小海
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“一个好党员”“应把公家的东西当作自己的东西一样来爱惜它，把党的公共的工作当作自己的工作一样尽心努力负责去工作。”这是反动的“公私溶化”论，是毒害党员思想的鸦片。
    怎样才能做一个好共产党员呢？伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”；“毫无自私自利之心的精神”。
    毛主席对一个共产党员的要求是无私、是大公，是把革命利益看得高于一切。伟大的共产主义战士雷锋之所以能够永远活在人们的心里，成为激励我们前进的光辉榜样，就是因为他“心里装着全体人民，唯独没有他自己。”我们中队的同志遵循毛主席的教导，以“老三篇”作为座右铭，向大公无私的精神境界进军，把“私”字当作天天射的靶子，人人自觉地亮靶，射靶，有力地促进了思想革命化。同志们说：我们生为保卫毛主席而战斗，死为保卫毛主席而献身，准备血洒长空，用自己的鲜血写出一个红彤彤的“忠”字。十几年来，我们就是靠着一颗红心，靠着毛泽东思想，打落打伤一架又一架的敌机。
    一个共产党员，心目中只有党的事业，革命的事业，只有人民，只有伟大的领袖毛主席，完全没有他自己，才能在平凡的工作岗位上，为革命作出应有的贡献；才能在战斗中有最大的勇敢，最大的智慧，最大的力量。年青的共产党员、僚机飞行员刘业孝，在一次编队飞行中遇到意外情况，着陆时，发动机由于油料耗尽而停车。在这千钧一发的关键时刻，早一秒钟着陆，就多一分安全；晚一秒钟着陆，就多一分死亡的危险。在这生死考验的严峻关头，刘业孝同志牢记毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，仍然紧跟在战友们的后面继续滑翔。为了不干扰指挥员的指挥，为了给战友有更多报告飞行状态的机会，他宁可自己不讲话，而让战友更多地使用无线电。飞机已经无法继续滑翔了，刘业孝同志仍不离开毛主席交给他的战斗武器，在同志们安全着陆以后，他才沉着、果敢地进行迫降，表现了用毛泽东思想哺育出来的共产党员的高贵品质，用无限忠于毛主席的一颗红心，用自己的行动，谱写出一曲“忠”字的凯歌！这给中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的利己主义世界观一记响亮耳光。
    公和私，是无产阶级和资产阶级这两个相互对立的阶级的思想，绝不能“溶化”起来。为公必弃私，顾私必损公。一个共产党员如果对个人的事情耿耿于怀，把“我”字看得高于一切，那他就不可能对无产阶级的事业尽心负责，更不可能有大无畏的牺牲精神。
    中国赫鲁晓夫极力对党员鼓吹
  “公私溶化”论，用心是很毒辣的。如果上了他的当，我们就会走上为个人奋斗的危险道路。我们共产党员一定要以毛泽东思想为武器，大破特破中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，彻底肃清它的流毒，大学大用毛主席著作，牢固树立一心为公的共产主义世界观，使自己成为永远忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的坚强战士。
