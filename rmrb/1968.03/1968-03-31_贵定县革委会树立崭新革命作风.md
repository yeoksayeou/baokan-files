The Revolutionary Committee of Guiding County, armed with the thoughts of Mao Zedong, guides the actions of the leading cadre. The comrades from the county's military sub-district participating in the "three-in-one combination" brought many good traditions, experiences, and styles from the People's Liberation Army to the county's Revolutionary Committee, greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the committee members.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres of Guiding County, under the support of the advanced unit in studying and applying Mao Zedong's works in Guizhou Province and the banner of supporting the left in Guizhou Province—the Guiding County Military Sub-district, seized power in March of the previous year and immediately established the county's Revolutionary Committee. At the first meeting of the county's Revolutionary Committee, everyone, with hearts full of excitement, solemnly swore before Mao Zedong's portrait: "We will forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great thought of Mao Zedong, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." However, how to truly achieve this, some comrades thought it was quite simple, believing that since they had come out of the revolutionary storm, their loyalty to Chairman Mao was already assured. The comrades from the county's military sub-district participating in the "three-in-one combination" promptly grasped these active thoughts and conducted a serious analysis and study. They believed that the most precious virtue is to love the great leader Chairman Mao infinitely. However, some leaders of the revolutionary factions and the Red Guards lacked sufficient understanding of the long-term and complex nature of class struggle and the arduousness of transforming one's worldview. Chairman Mao taught us: "Never forget class struggle." If we do not grasp class struggle and constantly raise our proletarian consciousness and awareness of line struggle, our loyalty to Chairman Mao will be mere lip service, not action. Therefore, they, together with the comrades of the county's Revolutionary Committee, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, enabling everyone to have a deeper understanding that the establishment of the revolutionary committee does not mean the end of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, but rather the starting point of a new battle. The class enemies will not readily accept their defeat; they will inevitably make a last-ditch struggle. At the same time, the danger of capitalist restoration also comes from the "self" in one's mind. If one relaxes the transformation of one's ideology, one may be hit by the enemy's sugar-coated bullets. On the ideological front, if the proletarian revolutionary factions do not plant the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, the class enemies will plant the black flag of revisionism.

The facts are indeed like this. As the class struggle deepens, the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in society has affected the internal affairs of the county's Revolutionary Committee. A member of the county's Revolutionary Committee, originally the leader of the largest revolutionary mass organization in the county, was once influenced by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, engaged in small-groupism, and conducted activities detrimental to the consolidation of the county's Revolutionary Committee, temporarily deviating from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The county's Revolutionary Committee conducted a class education around this incident, fighting against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism with proletarian party spirit. Through education, not only was the comrade who engaged in small-groupism helped, but everyone's class consciousness and awareness of line struggle were also raised. Everyone more clearly realized that "if the 'self' does not fall, the country is difficult to protect." To firmly establish a "loyalty," one must fiercely fight against "selfishness." Thus, a wave of fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism swept through the county's Revolutionary Committee, causing everyone to have a revolutionary explosion in their souls.

The comrades from the military sub-district also brought the glorious tradition of ideological and political work of the People's Liberation Army into the Revolutionary Committee. The leading cadres often engage in mutual assistance and heart-to-heart talks, holding a talk meeting every half month, taking the lead in reporting their thoughts and work to the collective, conducting criticism and self-criticism, and ensuring that the leading cadre's fight against selfishness continues and deepens. Through practice, the leading cadre members deeply felt that the more fiercely they fight against selfishness, the closer they follow Chairman Mao.

Maintaining the Humble Spirit of a Common Laborer

Chairman Mao taught us: "We communists are not seeking official positions, but revolution. We must have a thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not for a moment be separated from the masses. As long as we do not separate from the masses, we will definitely be victorious."

Among the members of the county's Revolutionary Committee, there are workers, community members, cadres, Red Guard revolutionary youths, revolutionary teachers, and medical workers. After joining the county's Revolutionary Committee, they have never left their original work positions. The county's Revolutionary Committee requires them to be good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought at their respective work positions, to model good work, and to act as bridges and ties between the Revolutionary Committee and the broad masses. The daily work of the county's Revolutionary Committee is handled by a combination of old and new members taking turns on duty to ensure that the leading cadre lives among the masses. Most members of the county's Revolutionary Committee actively turn their units into "experimental fields" for implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, obtaining first-hand materials, and better participating in the county's leading work. Commissioner Pan Qicai is a community member of Shaba Village, Dingnan Commune. He learned that some nearby production teams' Mao Zedong Thought study classes had affected the enthusiasm of the masses due to improper methods. He collected the opinions of the masses, improved the methods, and first conducted a pilot test in his own team, with good results. He immediately summarized the experience and reported it to the leading cadre, which was later promoted throughout the county, effectively guiding the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the rural areas of the entire county.

The comrades from the military sub-district realized from practice that achieving the ideological revolutionization of the leading cadre cannot be separated from the supervision and help of the masses, and one must sincerely and humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. They set an example in this regard. Once, a comrade criticized the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, He Baocheng, for having a bad attitude in speaking. He Baocheng, in addition to immediately apologizing to the comrade face to face, also seriously examined the root cause, realizing that the bad attitude in speaking was due to the rise of officialdom. He further conducted self-criticism in the leading cadre. His attitude towards the masses' criticism inspired the other members of the leading cadre. Everyone more clearly established the viewpoint that "the masses are the real heroes" and more consciously accepted the supervision of the masses, becoming students of the masses.

Commissioner Gong Huanru works at the county hospital. In the past, he complained that the masses criticizing him for having officialdom was "not understanding" him. After raising his awareness, he actively requested all the comrades in the hospital to criticize him and made a self-criticism at the mass meeting, also institutionalizing the practice of mobilizing the masses to criticize the leadership, conducting it once a month. The masses happily said to him: "We criticize you because we care for you, fearing that you will go astray. You can actively seek everyone's help like this, and we trust you even more."

The leading cadre of Guiding County, in order to more broadly listen to the opinions of the masses, regularly holds a meeting of the responsible comrades of revolutionary mass organizations once a month to listen to opinions from the masses. They also personally handle letters and visits from the masses, treating the reception station for mass visits as a good channel for connecting with the masses. He Baocheng and the deputy chairman of the county's Revolutionary Committee, Lan Jianmin, go to the reception station every evening to understand the reflections of the masses that day. In 1967, they handled 950 cases of letters and visits from the masses, ensuring that each case had a follow-up and each matter had a response, with 90% being resolved. This effectively strengthened the connection with the masses and drew wisdom and strength from the masses.

From the Masses, To the Masses

The great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around and see for themselves, adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience." The comrades from the Guiding County Military Sub-district firmly acted according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, taking the deepening of actual conditions, deepening of the grassroots, personally participating in the masses' struggles, and thoroughly changing the leading style as another major issue in helping the county's leading cadre achieve revolutionization.

Once the leading cadre was established, it was proposed to go deep into the grassroots, but it was delayed. Why? The military sub-district and the comrades of the county's Revolutionary Committee jointly conducted a detailed analysis. On the surface, it was because there was too much work and too many threads, making it difficult to get out of the administrative circle. In terms of ideology, there were still a few "fears": fearing that going deep into the grassroots would be too hard, fearing that encountering problems would be difficult to handle, fearing responsibility, and so on. What to do? Seek guidance from the works of Chairman Mao. They jointly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on ideological and work methods, investigation and research, and the mass line, compared them with their own ideological reality, analyzed and discussed, enabling everyone to realize that deepening into actual conditions and participating in the masses' struggles is the only way to seize the leading power. To be able to lead the masses, one must first learn from the masses. At the same time, this is also the necessary path to achieve the revolutionization of the leadership. Revolutionization can only be achieved in actual struggles. Work hinders progress, and one cannot go down. What to do? Ultimately, this is not just a work method issue, but a fundamental issue of whether to believe in and rely on the masses. Everyone made up their minds: go down! Except for one or two people often on duty in the office, the other members of the leading cadre, together with military cadres and other comrades, jointly formed a "three-in-one combination" Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, going deep into the rural areas, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and helping the grassroots implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The members of the leading cadre themselves carried their backpacks, did not take cars, and went wherever it was difficult, climbing mountains and crossing rivers. Wherever they went, they lived with the poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen, studied Chairman Mao's works together, and carried out revolutionary great criticism together. Dingnan Commune suffered from hail, and the deputy chairman of the county's Revolutionary Committee, Lan Jianmin, who had just returned from a forty-li journey, rushed to Dingnan upon hearing the news. He boosted the morale of the community members to produce and resist disasters with Mao Zedong Thought. The community members said: "Just when we needed leadership, the leadership came."

From deepening into actual conditions, the members of the leading cadre felt: going down made their hearts solid, their backs straight, their eyes bright, and their words powerful. Some comrades deeply felt: "Shouting a hundred times from above is not as good as going down for a walk." (According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou, March 29)

    用毛泽东思想武装领导成员的头脑指挥领导班子的行动
    贵定县革委会树立崭新革命作风
    参加三结合的县武装部的同志，把解放军的许多好传统、好经验、好作风带到县革委会，大大促进了革委会成员的思想革命化
    永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席
    贵定县无产阶级革命派，在贵州省军区活学活用毛主席著作的先进单位、贵州省支左工作的一面旗帜——贵定县武装部的支持下，于去年三月夺权后紧接着建立了县革命委员会。县革委会召开第一次会议时，大家怀着万分激动的心情，面对毛主席像庄严宣誓：永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。但是，怎样真正做到这一点，有的同志却想得很简单，认为自己是从革命暴风雨中“杀”出来的，忠于毛主席已经没有问题了。参加三结合的县革委会的武装部同志及时抓住这些活思想，并认真进行了分析、研究。他们认为，无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，是最可贵的大节。可是，一些革命派的头头和红卫兵革命小将，对阶级斗争的长期性、复杂性，对于改造自己世界观的艰巨性，缺乏足够的认识。毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”如果不抓阶级斗争，不时刻注意提高自己的无产阶级觉悟和路线斗争的觉悟，忠于毛主席，就是嘴上讲忠，行动上不忠。于是，他们就和县革委会的同志一起，反复学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的教导，使大家更深刻地认识到，革命委员会的成立，绝不意味着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的结束，而是新的战斗的起点。阶级敌人决不会甘心他们的失败，他们还必然要进行垂死挣扎。同时，资本主义复辟的危险还来自自己头脑里的“私”字，如果放松对自己的思想改造，就有可能被阶级敌人用糖衣裹着的炮弹击中。在思想阵地上，无产阶级革命派不插毛泽东思想的红旗，阶级敌人就要插修正主义的黑旗。
    事实也正是这样。随着阶级斗争的深入，社会上的资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，影响到了县革委会的内部。县革委会一位成员，原是县里一个最大的革命群众组织的头头。由于受资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的影响，他曾一度闹小团体主义，进行了不利于巩固县革委会的活动，一时背离了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。县革委会围绕着这件事情，进行了一场无产阶级党性同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性斗争的教育。经过教育，既帮助了这位闹小团体主义的同志，也提高了大家的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。大家更加清楚地认识到，“‘私’字不倒，江山难保”。要大树一个
  “忠”字，就必须狠斗一个“私”字。于是，县革委会里掀起了斗私批修的热潮，使大家在灵魂深处爆发革命。
    武装部的同志还把人民解放军做思想政治工作的光荣传统，带到革委会里。领导成员之间，经常开展互助谈心活动，半月开一次谈心会，带头向集体汇报自己的思想、工作情况，开展批评和自我批评，使领导班子的斗私活动持续、深入地开展下去。通过实践，领导班子的成员深刻体会到：斗私越狠，跟毛主席越紧。
      保持普通劳动者的本色
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”
    在县革委会成员中，有工人，有人民公社社员，有干部，有红卫兵革命小将和革命教师，还有医务工作者。他们参加县革委会工作后，一直没有脱离原来的工作岗位。县革委会要求他们在各自的工作岗位上，当好毛泽东思想宣传员，模范地搞好工作，并且在县革委会和广大群众之间起桥梁和纽带的作用。县革委会的日常工作，则采取新老结合、轮流值班的办法，以保证领导班子成员生活在群众中间。县革委会的多数成员，积极地把自己所在单位办成落实毛主席最新指示的“试验田”，取得第一手材料，更好地参与全县领导工作。委员潘启才，是定南公社沙坝大队的社员。他了解到邻近一些生产队举办的毛泽东思想学习班，因为方法不当，在某些方面影响群众的积极性。他收集了群众的意见，改进了方法，并且先在本队试点，效果很好。他立即总结了经验，向领导班子汇报，后来在全县推广，有力地指导了全县农村毛泽东思想学
  习班的工作。
    武装部的同志从实践中体会到，实现领导班子思想革命化，离不开群众的监督、帮助，必须虚心、诚恳地听取群众的意见。他们在这一方面又作出了表率。有一次，一个同志给革委会主任贺宝清提意见，批评他有一次说话态度不好。贺宝清除了马上找这个同志当面道歉外，还认真挖了思想根子，检查这次说话态度不好，表面上是性情急躁，实质上是官气抬头。他进一步在领导班子中作了自我批评。他对待群众批评的态度，启发了领导班子的其他成员。大家更明确地树立起“群众是真正的英雄”的观点，更加自觉地接受群众监督，当群众的小学生。
    县革委会常委巩桓如在县人民医院工作，过去埋怨群众批评他有官气是“不体谅”他，提高认识以后，主动要求全院同志给他提意见，并在群众大会上作了检讨，还把发动群众给领导提意见作为制度固定下来，每月进行一次。群众高兴地对他说：“我们批评你，是爱护你，怕你走到邪路上去。你能这样主动争取大家的帮助，我们更信得过你了。”
    贵定县领导班子为了更广泛地听取群众意见，每月定期召开一次革命群众组织负责人会议，听取来自群众中的意见。他们还亲自处理群众来信来访，把群众来访接待站作为联系群众的一条很好的渠道。贺宝清和县革委会副主任蓝建民，每天晚上都要到接待站了解当天群众的反映。一九六七年，他们处理了九百五十起群众来信来访，做到了件件有着落，事事有答复，百分之九十作了结案。这样做，有效地密切了和群众的联系，并且从群众中吸取了智慧和力量。
      从群众中来，到群众中去
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”贵定县武装部的同志坚决按照毛主席最新指示办事，把深入实际、深入基层，亲身参加群众斗争，彻底改变领导作风，当作帮助县领导班子实现革命化的又一个重大问题。
    领导班子一成立，就提出要深入下去，但迟迟下不去。为什么？武装部和县革委会的同志一同作了细致分析。从表面上看，是因为工作多，头绪多，陷在事务圈子里拔不出来。在思想上，仍旧是有几个“怕”字：怕深入下去生活艰苦，怕碰到问题不好处理，怕负责任，等等。怎么办？向毛主席著作请教。他们共同学习了毛主席关于思想方法和工作方法、调查研究、群众路线等方面的教导，对照自己思想实际，分析、讨论，使大家认识到，深入实际，参加群众斗争，是取得领导权的唯一途径。要能领导群众，就要先向群众学习。同时，这又是实现领导革命化的必由之路。革命化，只有在实际斗争中才能实现。事务绊腿，下不去，又怎么办？归根到底，这不单是个工作方法问题，而是一个是否相信群众、依靠群众的根本问题。大家下定决心：下去！领导班子的成员除经常有一两个人在机关值班外，其余都和军队干部、以及其他同志一起共同组成三结合的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入农村，宣传毛主席的最新指示，帮助基层落实毛主席的最新指示。
    领导班子的成员自己背着背包，不坐车，哪里艰苦就爬山涉水走到哪里去。走到哪里就和哪里的贫下中农、民兵住在一起，一起学习毛主席著作，一起开展革命的大批判。定南公社遭了雹灾，县革委会副主任蓝建民虽刚刚从四十里外赶路回到县里，闻讯连夜奔赴定南。用毛泽东思想把社员群众生产抗灾的士气鼓得足足的。社员群众说：“正当我们需要领导的时候，领导赶来了。”
    从深入实际中，领导班子的成员体会到：深入下去了，心里就扎实，腰杆子就硬，眼睛就亮，说话就有力。有的同志深有感受地说：“坐在上面喊百遍，不如下去走一遍。”（据新华社贵阳二十九日电）
