Vietnamese Democratic Republic Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Statement
Strongly Protests Japanese Government's Services to U.S. Imperialism's Aggression Against Vietnam

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 16 - According to recent reports from local newspapers, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic issued a statement on March 13, strongly protesting the Sato reactionary government of Japan for its new crimes of serving U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression against Vietnam by providing bases for B-52 bombers.

The statement said: It is well known that the Japanese government, for a long time, has been increasingly brazen in following the U.S. aggressors, turning Japan into the largest military logistics base in Asia for the U.S. to serve its war of aggression against the Vietnamese people. The Japanese government not only declared support for the U.S. policy of aggression but also allowed the U.S. to use various military bases on Japanese territory to serve this war, and provided the U.S. with manpower, weapons, ammunition, napalm, chemical poisons, and many other military supplies used in Vietnam.

The statement pointed out that on February 5, U.S. imperialism again dispatched about fifteen B-52 bombers to the U.S. air base on Okinawa, Japan. This is another extremely serious step taken by the Sato government in its collusion with U.S. imperialism, its opposition to the Vietnamese people, and its betrayal of the interests of the Japanese people and the peoples of Asia.

The statement strongly protests the aforementioned criminal actions of U.S. imperialism and the Sato reactionary government, and firmly demands that the Japanese government must stop allowing the U.S. to use Japanese territory as a base for B-52 bombers to launch attacks on South Vietnam. The U.S. government and the Japanese government must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences caused by their war actions.

The statement said, the Vietnamese people fully support the Japanese people's struggle to demand that the U.S. return Okinawa and abolish the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty." The Vietnamese people and the Japanese people's struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialist aggressors, to defend peace and national independence, will surely achieve victory.

	Vietnamese People's Army soldiers are determined to train themselves to be highly skilled, ready to strike back at the U.S. aggressors at any time.

　　越南民主共和国外交部发言人声明
　　强烈抗议日本政府为美帝侵越效劳
    新华社河内十六日电　据这里报纸最近报道：越南民主共和国外交部发言人十三日发表声明，强烈抗议日本佐藤反动政府为美帝国主义侵越政策效劳，向美国提供B—52轰炸机基地的新罪行。
    声明说：众所周知，日本政府长期以来日益变本加厉地追随美国侵略者，把日本变成为美国对越南人民进行的侵略战争服务的亚洲最大的军事后勤基地。日本政府不仅宣布支持美国侵略政策，而且还让美国使用日本领土上的各个军事基地为这场战争服务，并为美国提供了在越南使用的人力、武器、弹药、凝固汽油弹，化学毒药和许多其他军用物资。
    声明指出，二月五日，美帝国主义又派遣约十五架B—52轰炸机进驻日本冲绳岛的空军基地。这是佐藤政府在同美帝国主义勾结、反对越南人民、违背日本人民和亚洲人民的利益的行动中，又跨出了极其严重的新的一步。
    声明强烈抗议美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府的上述罪恶行动，坚决要求日本政府必须停止让美国使用日本领土作为B—52型飞机起飞轰炸越南南方的基地。美国政府和日本政府必须对它们的战争行动所造成的一切严重后果负全部责任。
    声明说，越南人民完全支持日本人民要求美国归还冲绳和废除“日美安全”条约的斗争。越南人民和日本人民反对共同敌人美帝国主义侵略者、保卫和平和民族独立的斗争事业一定取得胜利。（附图片）
