Keep Mao Zedong Thought in Mind and Guide the Masses to Follow the Party

The PLA propaganda team stationed at Hunan Village, Zhang Qiliang

Luo Ruiqing is an old opportunist. He fundamentally does not believe in the masses and absurdly claims that the masses do not want to accept the Party's policies. His famous black words are: “If you want the masses to accept (the Party's policies), they still won’t accept, and there’s nothing you can do. The mother wants to get married, and the sky wants to rain, there’s nothing you can do.” This is a slander against the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses and is a thoroughly bourgeois worldview.

Chairman Mao teaches Communist Party members to be students of the masses, to believe in the masses, to actively guide the masses to liberate themselves, and to be good at uniting the broad masses to fight. We revolutionary soldiers, in the “three supports, two militaries” work, are doing things according to Chairman Mao’s instructions.

We responded to Chairman Mao’s great call for the People’s Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses and came to Hunan Village. Here, class struggle is extremely fierce. A small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, in order to protect themselves, directed their spears at the masses, inciting antagonism among the masses. We, the People’s Liberation Army, are the most loyal defenders and executors of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. We resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary masses and give the broad leftist masses support. Therefore, this small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party hates us to death and fears us to death. They spread rumors and sow discord among the masses, trying to sabotage military-civilian unity. However, revolutionary soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought in their hearts are selfless and fearless, fearing neither heaven nor earth, daring to trample the ghosts and snakes underfoot.

In any situation, we always firmly believe in Chairman Mao’s great teaching that “we must resolutely believe that the majority of the masses are good, and that bad people are very few.” Through investigation, we find the essential problems from complex phenomena and realize that the majority of those who were incited are deceived. As long as we expose the enemy’s plots and propagate Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line to them, they will soon become enlightened. Thus, we turned the places where the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party incited trouble into battlefields for propagating Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, doing mass work, and exposing the enemy’s crimes and tricks. We also went deep into various production brigades and to the homes of the masses, actively and vigorously propagating the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, explaining what Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line is, what the direction of the struggle is, and what the capitalist reactionary line is. We also exposed the plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Peng Zhen to restore capitalism, arousing the class consciousness of the broad masses and enhancing their understanding of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. At the same time, we also care about the lives of the masses and help them solve their difficulties. All of this, the broad masses see it with their own eyes and remember it in their hearts. The masses expressed to us: “We will definitely listen to Chairman Mao’s words and follow Chairman Mao.” From then on, there emerged many touching stories of the masses loving the PLA.

As Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly grasped by the revolutionary masses and Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line is increasingly ingrained in their hearts, the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party becomes more and more isolated. Finally, these bad guys who manipulated the masses to fight the masses were exposed, and the masses who were deceived woke up one after another and firmly stood on Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.

More than a year of supporting-left work has made us deeply feel that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses have their hearts with Chairman Mao, with the PLA, and have the deepest class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, and have unlimited faith in Mao Zedong Thought. Some people, in a certain period, may temporarily not understand our policies, which is completely possible. However, as long as we act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions and firmly believe in the majority of the masses, we can guide the masses to follow Chairman Mao and make the revolution. The Chinese Khrushchev’s attempt to spread the fallacy that the masses do not accept policies and that there is nothing one can do, in order to sabotage the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the masses, is something that will never succeed. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, in the future supporting-left work, continue to make new contributions to the people!

    毛泽东思想记心头　引导群众跟党走
    驻河南寨公社毛泽东思想宣传队　张启良
    中国赫鲁晓夫是一个老机会主义者。他根本不相信群众，竟胡说群众不愿意接受党的政策。他有名的黑话是：“要求群众接受（党的政策），他还不接受，也没办法，娘要嫁人，天要下雨，毫无办法。”这是对亿万革命群众的污蔑，是地地道道的资产阶级世界观。
    毛主席教导共产党员要做群众的小学生，要相信群众，要积极引导群众自己解放自己，善于团结广大的群众进行战斗。我们革命战士在“三支”“两军”工作中，就是按照毛主席的指示去办事的。
    我们响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召来到河南寨时，这里阶级斗争非常激烈，党内一小撮走资派为了保护自己，把矛头指向群众，挑动群众之间的对立情绪。我们人民解放军是毛主席革命路线最忠诚的捍卫者和执行者，坚决支持革命群众的革命行动，给左派广大群众撑腰。因此，党内一小撮走资派对我们恨得要命，怕得要死，在群众中播弄是非，挑拨离间，破坏军民团结。但是，革命战士心中有了毛泽东思想，最无私，最无畏，天不怕，地不怕，敢把牛鬼蛇神踩在脚底下。
    我们无论在什么情况下，始终坚信毛主席的“要坚决相信大多数群众是好的，坏人是极少数”这一伟大教导。我们通过调查，从复杂的现象中找出本质问题来，认识到被挑动的人中绝大多数是受蒙蔽的，只要揭露敌人的阴谋，向他们宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，他们一定会很快觉悟过来。于是，我们把党内一小撮走资派挑动纠纷的场所，变成宣传毛主席革命路线、做群众工作的阵地，变成揭露敌人罪行和阴谋诡计的讲台。我们还深入到各大队，到群众家里，积极地向群众大力宣传毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，大讲什么是毛主席的革命路线，什么是斗争的大方向，什么是资产阶级反动路线；还揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫和以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团复辟资本主义的阴谋，激发广大群众的阶级觉悟，提高他们对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的认识。同时，我们还关心群众的生活，帮助他们解决困难。这一切，广大群众看在眼里，记在心上。群众向我们表示：“坚决听毛主席的话，跟毛主席走。”从此，出现了群众热爱解放军的许多动人事迹。
    随着毛泽东思想不断为革命群众所掌握，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的不断深入人心，党内一小撮走资派愈来愈孤立，最后这些在背后操纵群众斗群众的坏家伙被揭露了出来，原来受蒙蔽的群众纷纷觉醒，坚决站到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    一年多的支左工作，使我们深深地体会到，广大贫下中农、革命群众心向着毛主席，向着解放军，对党和毛主席、毛主席革命路线怀着最深厚的阶级感情，无限地信仰毛泽东思想。有些人，在一个时期内，对我们的政策暂时不理解，是完全可能的。但是，我们只要遵循毛主席指示办事，坚定地相信群众的绝大多数，就能引导群众跟着毛主席干革命。中国赫鲁晓夫极力散布群众“不接受”政策、“毫无办法”的谬论，妄图破坏党和群众的血肉关系，这是永远办不到的。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在今后支左工作中继续为人民立新功！
