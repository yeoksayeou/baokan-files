	Make rocks grow green leaves and flowers, make barren hills hang with golden melons and silver fruits. With their boundless love for Chairman Mao and their hardworking hands, the engineering troops turned the overgrown slopes into a “mixed vegetable garden.”

	Engineering Corps Unit 3 Company 8, stationed by the shores of Lake Alkali, had made their home on the sandy shores. The higher-ups often sent them fresh vegetables, but after the long journey, half of the vegetables would rot by the time they reached the soldiers of Company 8. The affection of Chairman Mao and the Party was deeply etched in the soldiers' hearts, but it also stirred up unease in their minds.

	The vast Lake Alkali had made the surrounding land saline, and only the slopes and hilltops far from the lake grew wild grass. One day, after completing a mission, Platoon Leader Li Shida heard the soldiers singing about Nanyuan. An idea sparked in his mind: Our revolutionary forebears, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "self-reliance and self-sufficiency," fought while producing, turning the "barren mountains" of Nanyuan into the "good Jiangnan" of Shaanbei. Why can't we do the same and rely on the vegetables sent by the higher-ups? That night, the entire platoon gathered around the kerosene lamp. Li Shida opened the red book and led everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on hard work and self-reliance and the "May 7th Directive." Everyone agreed: Solving the vegetable problem through our own efforts not only improves the living conditions of the troops and reduces the burden on the people but also carries forward the glorious tradition of hard work in our army, implements Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," and promotes our own ideological revolution. Comrades said: "We revolutionary soldiers, with our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and our hardworking hands, must make rocks grow green leaves and flowers, and make barren hills hang with golden melons and silver fruits!"

	Action followed words. The soldiers sent letters home requesting seeds for melons and vegetables, then picked up their hoes and shovels to start clearing the land. Everyone used their spare time between tasks to hack through the brush, clearing small patches of land from the rocks. They diverted a stream of fresh water from upstream, carrying it bucket by bucket to the slopes and hilltops, washing away the salt and alkali from the soil; they gathered cow dung from the mountains, burned it into ash, and prepared large amounts of fertilizer.

	Seeds arrived in small bags from all directions; the land was cleared and washed; the fertilizer was piled up by the fields. How to plant them well? They went to ask the nearby villagers for advice. The villagers kindly advised: "The wind is strong here, the soil is salty, and there are many pests. Only wild grass can grow here." The comrades said: "Strong winds can temper our will; heavy salinity can test our resolve; many pests, we have our hardworking hands!"

	The comrades improved the soil, burned the pests, and with sweat and water, planted the first batch of seeds. Everyone counted the days, eagerly waiting for the seeds to sprout. But as soon as the tender shoots emerged, they were eaten by pests overnight. They tried planting four times, but none were successful. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." Summarizing their experiences, they re-entered the battle with renewed confidence. After many attempts, they finally saw green sprouts growing in the fields.

	A patch of green sprouts brought everyone the joy of victory. In the morning, the comrades watered and fertilized the fields with dew on their feet; in the evening, they picked off pests one by one; at night, they used flashlights to hunt for locusts.

	Sunlight and rain nurtured the new sprouts. Under everyone's careful care, lush green vegetables covered every small plot of land, and everyone finally tasted the fresh vegetables grown in the "vegetable prohibition zone."

	The engineering troops, with their hardworking and skillful hands, turned the overgrown slopes into a “mixed vegetable garden” filled with various vegetables. Vegetables from Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, and Henan, among others, all found a home here. Even the small trees and rock edges were adorned with gourds, winter melons, and bottle gourds. The soldiers also raised two large fat pigs, more than twenty white geese, and over a hundred chickens and ducks. People unfamiliar with the situation, upon seeing "geese and ducks quacking, chickens running all over the hills," might think this was a large village!

	The soldiers sent their labor fruits to the nearby villagers. The villagers praised them, saying, "Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can win battles with guns and turn barren mountains and saline land into fragrant vegetables with hoes. Truly remarkable!"

　　叫岩石长出绿叶鲜花，叫荒岗挂满金瓜银果。工程兵战士凭着对毛主席无限热爱的红心和一双勤劳的手，把荒草丛生的陡坡山岗变成了——
　　“什锦菜园”
    工程兵某部三连八班，在碱水湖畔的沙石滩上安了家。上级机关经常给他们运来上好的蔬菜，但是，经过长途运输，菜到八班战士手里，已经烂掉了一半。毛主席和党的亲切关怀，深深地印在战士们心里，同时，也激起了他们思想上的不安。
    茫茫的碱水湖淹碱了四周的土地，只有远离碱水湖的山坡和岗顶上才长着茅草。一天，班长李时达执行任务回来，听见战士们正在歌唱南泥湾，脑海里翻起了一个浪花：我们的革命老前辈，遵照毛主席“自己动手，丰衣足食”的教导，一边打仗一边生产，把“到处是荒山”的南泥湾变成了陕北的“好江南”，难道我们就只能吃上级送来的现成菜？晚上，全班同志围坐在煤油灯旁，李时达打开了红彤彤的宝书，组织大家学习了毛主席关于艰苦奋斗的教导和“五·七”指示。大家一致认识到：自己动手解决蔬菜问题，不但可以改善部队生活，减轻人民负担，而且可以发扬我军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，落实毛主席的“五·七”指示，促进自己思想革命化。同志们说：“我们革命战士，凭着对毛主席一颗无限忠诚的红心和一双勤劳的手，一定要叫岩石长出绿叶鲜花，要叫荒岗挂满金瓜银果！”
    说干就干。战士们向自己的家乡发出了一封封要瓜种菜子的书信，接着就扛着锹镐去开荒。大家利用工间空隙时间，劈荆斩棘，在石头缝里开出了一小块、一小条的荒地。他们从河流的上游引来了一股淡水，把水一担担地挑到山坡和岗顶上，一块块地洗掉了土里的盐碱；他们又从山上拣来了牛粪，烧了草木灰，准备了大量的肥料。
    种子，一小袋、一小袋地从四面八方邮来了；地，一块块地开好了，洗净了；肥，一堆堆地送到了地边。怎样才能种好呢？他们又去请教驻地附近的老乡。老乡好心地劝他们说：这里风沙大，盐碱重，害虫多，历来只能生长茅草。同志们说：“风沙大，可以锻炼我们的意志；盐碱重，可以考验我们的决心；害虫多，我们有勤劳的双手！”
    同志们改良了土壤，烧死了害虫，一串汗珠一担水地把第一批种子播进了地里。大家扳着手指算天数，好不容易盼着种子发了芽。可是嫩芽刚出土，过一晚就被害虫吃光了。接连撒了四次种都没有成功。大家学习了毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”总结了经验教训，信心百倍地重新投入战斗。经过多次的反复，终于使地里长出了一片片葱绿的嫩苗。
    一片片的嫩苗，给大家带来了胜利的喜悦。早晨，同志们踏着露水浇水施肥；傍晚，一根苗一根苗地捕捉害虫；深夜，还打着手电去消灭地蚂蚱。
    阳光雨露育新苗。在大家精心的管理下，绿油油的青菜铺满了每一块小地，大家终于尝到了在“蔬菜禁区”长出来的新鲜蔬菜。
    工程兵战士用勤劳灵巧的双手，把荒草丛生的陡坡山岗，变成了种有各种蔬菜的“什锦菜园”。湖南的辣椒，广东的萝卜，广西的空心菜，山东的大葱，河南的包心白菜等十几种蔬菜，都在这里安家落了户，就连小树上、岩石尖也挂上了南瓜、冬瓜和丝瓜。战士们还养了两口大肥猪，喂了二十多只大白鹅和一百多只鸡鸭，不了解情况的人乍一来，看见“鹅鸭嘎嘎叫，鸡子满山钻”，还以为这里是一个大村庄哩！
    战士们把自己的劳动果实送给附近的老乡。老乡们竖起大拇指，赞不绝口地说：“毛泽东思想武装起来的子弟兵，拿起枪来能打胜仗，抡起锄来能叫荒山碱地瓜菜香，真是了不起！”
