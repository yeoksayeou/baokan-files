The great leader Chairman Mao's March 7th directives and the series of extremely important directives on "resuming classes and making revolution," "education must be revolutionized," and others are important components of Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and strategy for the continuing revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are strategic measures for preventing revisionism and are long-term plans for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, ensuring that our country will never change color. These directives must be resolutely carried out and implemented in every detail and in full. To implement Chairman Mao's March 7th directives, we must respond to Chairman Mao's great call for "all levels and types of schools to resume classes and make revolution," because this is the top priority for all levels and types of schools at present, the key to doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the major direction of the current proletarian cultural revolution in schools, and an important measure for determining whether one is a genuine revolutionary of the proletariat who is determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. Insisting on resuming classes and making revolution, and vigorously promoting educational revolution, is the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao.

To implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives and the great directives on educational revolution, we must go through fierce struggles between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the bad elements within our ranks, and the ghosts and monsters in society will not readily accept their defeat. They are using anarchism and the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie in every possible way to disrupt and sabotage the great direction of "resuming classes and making revolution" and educational revolution as pointed out by Chairman Mao. The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students must not let down their guard or become complacent.

    把复课闹革命推向新高潮
    伟大领袖毛主席的“三·七”指示和“复课闹革命”、“教育要革命”等一系列极其重要的指示，是毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策的重要组成部分，是反修防修的战略措施，是培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，保证我们的国家永不变色的千年大计、万年大计。必须坚决贯彻执行，条条落实、全面落实。落实毛主席“三·七”指示，又必须响应毛主席“大中小学校都要复课闹革命”的伟大号召，因为这是当前各级各类学校的头等大事，是搞好学校斗、批、改的关键，是当前学校无产阶级文化大革命的大方向，也是衡量是否做“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”的重要标志。坚持复课闹革命，狠抓教育革命，就是对毛主席最大的忠。
    贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示和教育革命的伟大指示，要经过两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。党内一小撮走资派、混在我们内部的坏人和社会上的牛鬼蛇神决不甘心他们的失败，他们正在利用无政府主义和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，千方百计地干扰和破坏毛主席指出的“复课闹革命”和教育革命的大方向，广大红卫兵小将和革命师生员工切莫丧失警惕，掉以轻心。
