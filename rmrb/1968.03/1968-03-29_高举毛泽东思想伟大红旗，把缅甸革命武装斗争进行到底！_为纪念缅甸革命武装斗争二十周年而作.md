The armed revolution of the Burmese people has reached its 20th anniversary on March 28, 1968.

On March 28, 1948, the ruling class launched a reactionary civil war, attempting to completely annihilate the Communist Party of Burma and progressive forces.

The Communist Party of Burma and the masses, mainly relying on their own strength, fought back against the counter-revolutionary war with a revolutionary war.

Lenin taught us: "In a revolutionary period, what thousands and thousands of people learn in a week is more than what they learn in a year of confused life." This is very correct.

Over the past 20 years, the armed struggle in Burma has undergone various twists and turns, overcome numerous difficulties, and gained some experience. In other words, the 20-year armed struggle of the Burmese people is like a revolutionary university. Those who participate in the revolution enter this school and are tempered in politics, ideology, military affairs, organization, economics, and other aspects. They cultivate the spirit of hard struggle, serving the party, the revolution, and the people, and dedicating themselves. Many party members and soldiers have gained some experience in applying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in practice.

Over the past 20 years, many members, soldiers, and comrades of the Burmese Communist Party have sacrificed their lives, contributing their lives to the party, the revolution, and the people.

The work of every martyr has been taken over by new comrades. The revolutionary ranks have thus been continuously replenished with new strength and thrown into battle.

On this 20th anniversary of the armed struggle in Burma, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Burma and Chairman Déqīn Dāndōng, we pay revolutionary respects to the martyrs! At the same time, we guarantee that we will be loyal to these martyrs and complete the unfinished revolutionary cause.

On the 20th anniversary of the armed revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people, the international situation is very favorable.

The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which has shaken the world, has greatly strengthened the power of the base of world proletarian revolution—the People's Republic of China. In the situation where the revolutionary people of the world are increasingly mastering the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary movement of the world proletariat is developing and growing with tremendous momentum. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially in Southeast Asia, the sparks of revolution have already spread into a prairie fire. The heroic people of Vietnam have achieved great victories in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. The tide of struggle against American imperialism is surging higher and higher in North America, Western Europe, and the world.

Today, in Burma, the revolutionary situation is also very good. With the development of the revolutionary war, our base areas have become more consolidated and expanded. In Burma, from the east in Shan State to the west in Arakan State, from the south in Ye, Tharrawaddy, and Danu to the north in Myitkyina, there are revolutionary base areas. During the 20-year revolutionary war in Burma, we have established seven consolidated base areas.

The northern upper base area is distributed in the Gada, Bhamo, and Kachin areas.

The northwestern base area is distributed in the Bago, Minbu, and areas near the Arakan Mountains.

The central base area controls a large area, including Bhamo, Minbu, Pyinmana, Mandalay, and southern Shan State.

The Arakan base area stands on the west coast of Burma, extending to the border with Pakistan.

The Dala base area is located in the coastal area of southernmost Burma and is adjacent to Thailand.

The Delta base area controls the main rice-producing area of Burma. Our party and people's army, together with the revolutionary Karen armed forces, are continuously launching attacks on the Ne Win military government in this area and controlling vast rural areas.

The Bago mountain area base area is distributed in the Bago, East Bago, Yinmabin, Daya, and Hpyu areas, extending to the vicinity of the Burmese capital, Rangoon. The existence and development of this base area pose a constant threat to the enemy and gradually form a situation of encircling the enemy's heartland.

In addition to the above consolidated base areas, there are extensive guerrilla areas and combat areas throughout Burma.

Currently, the base areas and guerrilla areas account for 67% of the national territory. On the one hand, our enemy—the Ne Win military government—uses railways, highways, and other transportation lines and cities as strongholds to encircle our base areas. On the other hand, our party and people's army, as well as the armed forces participating in the National Democratic United Front, operate in the rural areas of the entire country, forming a nationwide counter-encirclement against the enemy through extensive guerrilla warfare.

Over the past 20 years of revolutionary war in Burma, our basic forces—the party, people's army, local guerrilla forces, militias, etc.—have developed and consolidated.

We have summarized the experience of the struggle between the two lines within the party over the past 20 years of the revolutionary war in Burma, armed the entire party with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely smashed modern revisionism within the party, and formulated a program, line, and policy in accordance with contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought.

Over the past 20 years of revolutionary war in Burma, we have not only fought against revisionism within the party but have also engaged in fierce struggles against foreign revisionism. For example, in 1954, the Soviet revisionist leadership headed by Khrushchev exerted various pressures on us to abandon armed struggle and cooperate with U Nu; at the same time, the Chinese Khrushchev also exerted pressure on us to abandon armed struggle and cooperate with the ruling class.

However, our party adhered to Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely withstood their pressures, and never abandoned armed struggle. Therefore, our armed struggle has been able to continue for 20 years.

The Soviet revisionist clique, seeing that they could not subjugate our party, attempted to establish a communist party in Burma that would sing a different tune from ours. Due to the opposition of the people, their despicable plot did not succeed.

Now, the Soviet revisionist leadership openly supports the Ne Win military reactionary government, praising Ne Win's "Burmese Socialist Program" as a "non-capitalist path." This is a betrayal of the armed struggle of the Burmese people.

Chairman Mao said very correctly: "At present, the task of opposing revisionism is particularly urgent." Our 20 years of experience prove: if we do not concentrate our efforts to oppose revisionism, our armed struggle will not be able to continue.

Over the past 20 years, we have waged many long-term struggles against revisionism within and outside the party, at home and abroad, and have achieved basic victories.

If we say that the history of our party's 20 years of armed struggle is the history of concentrating efforts to overthrow revisionism and establishing Mao Zedong Thought, that would not be wrong. Therefore, our party has already united on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and has further strengthened and played the leading role of the party in the Burmese revolutionary war.

The people's army, which accepts the absolute leadership of the party armed with Mao Zedong Thought and grasps Chairman Mao's military line, has rapidly developed its strength, established a three-in-one system of militias, local forces, and main forces, improved political and ideological standards, strengthened the unity of officers and soldiers and the unity of the army and the people, boosted morale, and more skillfully mastered guerrilla warfare and annihilation warfare.

With the development and growth of our party and armed forces, the worker-peasant alliance led by the party has also been consolidated and further developed.

In the rural base areas, we have established poor peasants' associations and peasant associations (including poor and middle peasants), established a rural people's democratic government based on poor and hired peasants and united with middle peasants, established the pillar of the rural people's democratic government—the militia, eliminated the political power and economic power of landlords and rich peasants (in the current stage, we do not touch the economic power of rich peasants) as the social base of the Ne Win military government in the countryside, disbanded the pillars of the Ne Win military government in the countryside, namely the "Security Administrative Committee," "Land Committee," and "Agricultural Comprehensive Cooperative," confiscated the materials of the so-called "People's Stores" of the Ne Win military government, and distributed them to the basic rural masses. The mass movement to confiscate and distribute the materials of the "People's Stores" is currently continuing to develop widely.

In the relatively stable Delta and Arakan base areas, the work of restoring land distribution has already begun. In the guerrilla areas, combat areas, and enemy-occupied areas, struggles are being widely waged to demand a price of 500 kyats per hundred baskets of rice, to oppose the Ne Win army's raids on the countryside to seize rice, to sabotage the enemy's ports, rice mills, and transportation to stop the enemy from exporting rice and solve the domestic food problem, to keep rice from leaving the village and to carry out mutual adjustment, to seize and distribute rice, to confiscate and distribute state-owned timber, to confiscate state-owned materials, and to sabotage enemy materials, machinery, buildings, and bridges that cannot be transported or distributed in time.

The peasant struggles led by the party are not purely economic struggles, not purely for the purpose of obtaining food and materials, but are political struggles with mass characteristics, adopting various forms of struggle suitable for the local situation, combining politics, military affairs, and economics, and giving a comprehensive and heavy blow to the Ne Win military government. These struggles serve to continuously annihilate the enemy, establish and expand base areas, and establish people's democratic governments, providing tremendous help for consolidating the foundations of building the party, building the army, and establishing a united front in various places.

Over the past 20 years of revolutionary war in Burma, our party has, on the basis of a consolidated worker-peasant alliance, united all forces that can be united, and seriously carried out the work of a united front against imperialism, feudalism, and the Ne Win military government. Therefore, while our basic forces have rapidly developed, our united front has also developed, and the armed forces participating in the National Democratic United Front have also developed.

Our party, in 1959, together with the Karen National United Party, New Mon State Party, Kayah National Progressive Party, Chin National Council, established the National Democratic United Front. This front has been consolidated in the struggle against the Ne Win military government. With the development and growth of our basic forces and the armed forces participating in the National Democratic United Front, the mass movements in the enemy-occupied areas have also developed.

Especially in the situation of a food crisis, the working people living in the cities, in order to solve the problem of hunger, have held demonstrations and marches, and waged struggles to seize rice. In the city of Akyab in Arakan State and the town of Mawlaik, the hungry masses rose up to seize rice and were shot by the Ne Win military government's army, killing more than a hundred people and injuring many. This incident occurred on August 13, 1967, and had a great impact on the country. Workers, because they could not bear the economic difficulties and oppression, left their posts to protest, and students also took various forms to protest against the oppression of the Ne Win military government and school authorities. This means that in the enemy-occupied areas, various classes and strata are taking various forms to struggle against the Ne Win military government.

Over the past 20 years of revolutionary war in Burma, due to the development and consolidation of the party and various revolutionary forces, the ruling class and the Ne Win military government have faced difficulties in politics, economics, military affairs, and other aspects.

Over the past 20 years, the ruling class has used the reactionary civil war to attempt to annihilate our party and various revolutionary forces. They once boasted, "The Anti-Fascist League will rule for 40 years."

No matter how the ruling class tries to annihilate us, we have not been annihilated. On the contrary, the ruling class has been split into pieces due to our party's armed struggle and its internal contradictions. During these 20 years, due to the influence of domestic class contradictions and the contradictions within the ruling class, the ruling Anti-Fascist League has split many times, and the government has changed many times.

Since the Ne Win military clique came to power, there has been internal strife and continuous splits. On the other hand, during this period, the reactionary policies implemented by the ruling class have intensified class contradictions, making the ruling class face crises in politics, economics, military affairs, and other aspects.

The Ne Win military clique, in order to establish a military monopoly capitalist system, openly implements fascist military dictatorship, adopts unprecedentedly cruel oppression measures, and even discards the mask of bourgeois democracy that previous governments have worn.

The Ne Win military dictatorship government has intensified its anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary activities, persecuting and massacring ethnic minorities.

This government, on July 7, 1962, in Rangoon, shot and killed more than a hundred university students and wounded more than three hundred. This is one of the rare July massacres in world history. This is the signal of its implementation of fascist military dictatorship.

This government, on March 28, 1963, banned all political parties and mass organizations and implemented the one-party dictatorship of the "Socialist Program Party."

This government, under the pretext of protection, imprisoned thousands of people, including many progressive figures. It uses a batch of military spies trained by the United States, Japan, and Israel to implement unprecedented terrorist rule; in prisons, it implements the most cruel persecution and massacre.

The Ne Win military government implements Great Burman chauvinism. In its more than six years in power, from the north in Kachin State to the south in Danu and Tharrawaddy, it has brutally oppressed and exploited the Karen, Kachin, Shan, Pa-O, Intha, Pa-O, Mon, Kayah, Chin, Arakan, Naga, and Lisu ethnic minorities; it uses military means to brutally suppress and massacre the ethnic minorities that are waging armed revolutionary struggles.

This government implements military monopoly capitalist rule in various ethnic minority states, making the political, social, economic, and other conditions of the people of various ethnic minorities worse than ever before. They, like the people of the Burmese mainland, are in a state of hunger.

The reactionary policies of the Ne Win military government have not only caused political crises but also economic crises.

Under the military monopoly capitalist rule of the Ne Win military clique, national production has declined year by year. Private small industries and small handicraft industries have gone bankrupt in large numbers. The number of unemployed people is close to two million. The reactionary land policy of the Ne Win military government has made the vast majority of peasants not only suffer from various exploitations of feudal landlords but also suffer from the severe exploitations of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Due to the decline in production and the monopoly of domestic trade to extract high profits, the national economy has fallen into chaos, prices have soared, goods are in short supply, and people are facing famine.

The Ne Win military dictatorship government, which has been in power for more than six years, also faces a military crisis.

Currently, the enemy has the advantage in military strength, which is a fact. However, the enemy not only faces insurmountable contradictions in politics and economics but also faces insurmountable contradictions in the military. These contradictions are: the contradiction between combat missions and the missions of defending cities and transportation lines; the contradiction between concentrating forces to attack our party and concentrating forces to attack various ethnic minorities within the country; the contradiction between the forces needed in the military and the many forces used in economics and administration. These contradictions are developing day by day. The enemy's forces are insufficient, and they are in a situation of being surrounded on all sides.

The military struggles waged by our party and people's army are on a larger scale, more intense, and more annihilation in nature. The National Democratic United Front and other patriotic and progressive forces also give the Ne Win military government heavier blows. We have achieved greater and greater victories. Even on the railways, highways, inland waterways, and cities controlled by the Ne Win army, one can hear gunshots and explosions.

The Ne Win military dictatorship government launched an attack on the Bago mountain revolutionary base area since early August last year. However, under the battle cry of "counterattack to smash the enemy's attack" by Chairman Déqīn Dāndōng and the party central, our people's army and revolutionary people struck and annihilated these fascist troops, smashing the enemy's attack.

For example, in the battle of Dona Yapa Kong in the Pakokku area of Hpyu, the people's army annihilated more than a platoon of the enemy. In the Minla area, the people's army annihilated an entire platoon of the enemy. On the Rangoon-Mandalay and Rangoon-Hpyu railway lines, enemy trains and freight cars were blown up by landmines. On November 21 last year, the people's army, in a lightning attack, annihilated two platoons of the enemy, fully armed with American automatic weapons, who were attacking the Nadlin and Zigon areas of the Bago mountain foothills. On March 6 this year, the people's army concentrated 200 troops to attack the town of An in the Arakan mountain area, occupied the town for 24 hours, seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and daily necessities, released prisoners from the prison, and destroyed the police barracks, treasury, warehouses, and communication facilities.

In other places, battles of annihilating the enemy also frequently occur, and our people's army has achieved great victories.

The political, economic, and military crises of the Ne Win military government are becoming more and more serious. Ne Win is like sitting on a landmine about to explode.

In order to get rid of these crises, the Ne Win military government has intensified its anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary activities, further suppressing and massacring people of all ethnic groups.

When the ruling class encounters comprehensive crises and is on the verge of death, in order to get rid of the crisis, they use their usual tricks, which is to cunningly use religion to attack the Communist Party of Burma and progressive forces.

In 1958, the ruling class put forward the so-called "religious crisis" to oppose and attack our party. However, the Burmese people, with their revolutionary traditions and rich experience, saw through the ruling class's despicable plot of using religion and did not fall for it.

The reactionary policies of the Ne Win military government have brought unprecedented suffering to the people and aroused great anger among the people. Now, in order to divert attention, the Ne Win military government has again put forward the so-called "religious crisis," using religion to attack our party. However, this time, it will definitely be met with resistance from the masses, just like the last time.

Not long ago, the Ne Win military government, in order to get rid of the crisis, released from prison Ba Maw, U Thant, U Kyaw Nyein, and feudal lords who have always shown reactionary tendencies in Burmese politics, and spread the rumor that they also released communists. Their purpose is to unite all rightists and reactionaries under the slogans of "defending the federation," "national unity," "eliminating domestic and foreign rebels," and "anti-China" to further launch a wave of anti-communist, anti-people, suppression and massacre of ethnic minorities, sabotage of the revolution, and anti-China activities.

Internationally, the Ne Win military government, in order to get rid of the crisis, is further intensifying its anti-China activities. It accepts more aid from American imperialism and further colludes with American imperialism. Ne Win personally visited his master, the American imperialist leader Johnson, in September 1966, shamelessly saying, "I am the most enthusiastic anti-communist in Asia." This means that he guarantees to sell out the country and the people to the maximum extent. Therefore, American imperialism also agreed to provide the Ne Win military government with more money, weapons, and technology. A very obvious example is that last year, American imperialism sold rifles to Ne Win, charging only 25 cents per rifle.

The Soviet revisionist leadership, which has always opposed the Communist Party of Burma and the Burmese revolution, opposed Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of China, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, has also intensified its collusion with the Ne Win military government. The Soviet revisionist clique providing a ship full of weapons to the Ne Win military government is a clear example.

At the same time, the Ne Win military government is also intensifying its collusion with Japanese reactionaries. Not long ago, the Ne Win military government sent a military delegation to Japan to purchase weapons. Not only that, it has tried and is trying to collude with the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek in Burma to oppose our party, our people's army, and the People's Republic of China.

The Ne Win military government is intensifying its reliance on American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and domestic and foreign reactionaries, desperately selling out the Union of Burma and the Burmese people. It not only cannot solve various difficulties but, on the contrary, the difficulties will become more and more serious.

Today, the country is facing various political, economic, and social difficulties, and people of all classes, strata, and ethnic groups hate the Ne Win military government to death. Today, in Burma, the Ne Win military government is the representative of the three great enemies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. It betrays national interests and desperately sells out the entire Union of Burma. It is a lackey of American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and domestic and foreign reactionaries, and the culprit behind various disasters. The people of all ethnic groups are increasingly seeing through the reactionary true face of the Ne Win military government.

In the current situation, the only way to get rid of various crises is to overthrow the representative of the three great enemies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—the Ne Win military government. For this, it is necessary to establish a broad united front against the Ne Win military government, including workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, ethnic minorities, patriotic capitalists, and other democratic forces.

In the current stage of the revolution, the historical task of our party is, relying on the strength of this united front, to liberate all of Burma and establish a new People's Democratic Federal Republic based on various revolutionary classes and revolutionary ethnic minorities, which is completely independent, democratic, prosperous, peaceful, happy, and equal and united among all ethnic minorities.

Over the past 20 years of revolutionary war in Burma, our party has gained certain experiences and lessons. In the statement of the party central on the 20th anniversary of the armed struggle, some experiences and lessons have been expounded. This article wants to expound some of the main experiences and lessons.

First, the most important experience and lesson of the Burmese armed revolution is: when our party combines Mao Zedong Thought with the revolutionary practice of Burma, the revolution achieves victory; when it deviates from or abandons Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution suffers defeat. When our party firmly adheres to the path of the Chinese revolution (the continuation of the October Revolution), the revolution achieves victory; when it deviates from or abandons the path of the Chinese revolution, the revolution suffers defeat and loss.

The greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "Without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution."

The revolutionary practice of Burma has already clearly proved that this universal truth taught by Chairman Mao has great power and is very correct. Practice has proved that whoever deviates from Chairman Mao's teaching or wavers in this teaching will suffer losses and defeats in the revolutionary war.

The greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao, teaches us to implement the strategy of establishing rural base areas and surrounding cities with the countryside, and to take the road of seizing power through a protracted people's war.

The revolutionary history of Burma has already clearly proved the unparalleled correctness of this teaching and proved that deviating from this teaching will lead to setbacks and defeats.

Our party as early as February 1949 decided not only to take the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin but also to take the doctrines of Comrade Mao Zedong as our guiding principles. Today, it is not enough to just take this attitude. Therefore, our party has determined a complete and correct attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism and the global victory of socialism. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism.

Therefore, to oppose Mao Zedong Thought is to oppose Marxism-Leninism. Whoever accepts Marxism-Leninism in words but rejects Mao Zedong Thought in practice is an opportunist, a revisionist.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all revolutionary work in Burma. Comrade Mao Zedong's theories on the construction of the proletarian party, the construction of the people's army, and the theory of people's war are even more the guiding light for the victory of the Burmese revolution.

For a proletarian revolutionary or a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, the primary and most fundamental condition is to study and firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, loyally apply Mao Zedong Thought, and use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle.

Therefore, our party will, within the party and in the international communist movement, resolutely fight against all those who oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

Now let's talk about the two main key issues of the Burmese revolution. The first issue is the peasant issue, the land revolution issue. The second issue is the ethnic minority issue. Only by correctly and well solving these two issues can the Burmese revolution achieve victory.

The armed revolution in Burma has proved that in backward agricultural economies where agriculture dominates and peasants make up the majority of the population, only by relying on the peasant masses, propagating, organizing, and arming the peasant masses, and solving the peasant issue, can a protracted revolutionary war be waged and victory achieved.

Peasants make up more than 80% of the population of Burma. Peasants suffer from the triple oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Therefore, peasants have high enthusiasm for the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and the ruling bourgeoisie and the land revolution, and they resolutely join the struggle. Under the leadership of our party headed by Chairman Déqīn Dāndōng, the main axis of the current people's democratic revolution is the land revolution. In the people's democratic revolution, the leadership of the peasant struggle and the leadership of the land revolution struggle are our party's basic tasks. Only by resolutely carrying out the land revolution can the current revolution achieve victory.

Chairman Mao pointed out that peasants are the most reliable and broadest allies of the proletariat and the main force of the revolutionary war.

Therefore, the people's democratic revolution is a peasant war led by the working class. The main source of the people's army is peasants. The material and financial resources needed for a protracted war also come from peasants.

Therefore, the revolutionary war in Burma fully proves that as long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions, truly rely on peasants, solve the peasant issue, and carry out the land revolution, we can persist in a protracted war and create the basic conditions for the final victory.

According to the experience of the revolutionary war in Burma, correctly solving the ethnic minority issue is an important key to achieving revolutionary victory.

Burma is not a country with only the Burmese ethnic group but a country with more than a hundred ethnic groups, including the Kachin, Karen, Kayah, Chin, Burmese, Mon, Shan, Arakan, Pa-O, etc.

Ethnic minorities are scattered throughout the country, but they mainly reside in the border areas, and these areas account for about two-thirds of the total area of Burma and about 45% of the total population.

After the Burmese bourgeoisie compromised with British imperialism and seized power, the ruling class over the past 20 years has not only brutally oppressed and exploited the Burmese people but also implemented Great Burmese chauvinism, brutally oppressing and exploiting various ethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities cannot bear the oppression and exploitation of the ruling bourgeoisie's Great Burmese chauvinism and have taken up arms to resist the ruling class. The Karen, Kachin, Arakan, Mon, Intha, Pa-O, Kayah, Chin, and Shan ethnic minorities are waging long-term armed struggles.

Therefore, the armed struggles of various ethnic minorities are the issue of fighting for complete national equality and the right to self-determination. It is an important component of the people's democratic revolution carried out in the entire country of Burma.

Today, the various ethnic minorities of Burma are at different stages of political and economic development. The degree of class differentiation is also different. To correctly solve the national issue, we must grasp the class essence of this issue. Comrade Stalin taught us, "The basis of the national question, its inner essence, remains the peasant question."

Chairman Mao also taught us, "National struggle, after all, is a class struggle issue."

Today, the armed revolutions of various ethnic minorities in Burma are essentially peasant issues. According to the experience of our party, correctly leading and solving the national issue is the issue of forming an alliance between the working class and the peasant class under the leadership of the working class. Therefore, correctly solving the national issue is a very important link in achieving revolutionary victory.

The Ne Win military government, which implements bourgeois Great Burmese chauvinism, can never solve the current national issue in Burma. Only the Communist Party of Burma, which adheres to the proletarian policy of national unity, can correctly solve this issue.

Our party advocates that all ethnic minorities in Burma are equal. In politics, economics, society, culture, and other aspects, they must have equal rights. All ethnic minorities must have full self-determination rights and full self-governance rights.

Marxist-Leninists believe that the right to self-determination is an inherent right of all ethnic minorities and that this right to self-determination includes the right to secession.

The so-called right to secession does not mean establishing another small state but opposes all national oppression and advocates the equality, unity, and cooperation of all ethnic minorities.

Regarding this issue, Comrade Lenin taught us, "The right to self-determination does not mean the demand for secession, dispersion, and the establishment of small states, but is a thorough expression of opposition to all national oppression."

Comrade Lenin also taught us, "We propose the right to self-determination not to 'advocate' secession, but on the contrary, to promote and accelerate the democratic rapprochement and fusion of all ethnic minorities."

The greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao, creatively developed Marxism-Leninism on the national issue. He clearly proposed, "Recognize the right to self-government of all ethnic minorities within China," "Advocate equal union, not mutual oppression." The so-called self-government refers to self-government from the village level to the provincial level.

Chairman Mao's wise and correct judgment is not only completely applicable to China but also completely applicable to the specific situation of Burma.

Under the Great Burmese chauvinist regime of the Ne Win military government, the so-called "friendship and unity of all ethnic minorities within the country" no longer exists.

One ethnic group points a gun at another ethnic group, while saying something about friendship and unity, which is purely shameless deception.

Therefore, our party resolutely opposes the armed suppression of ethnic minorities by the Ne Win military government with a Great Burmese chauvinist attitude. At the same time, we also resolutely oppose the attempts of imperialism and its followers to split Burma.

In the current situation, if the slogan of secession and the establishment of an independent state is raised, it would be to cater to the needs of imperialism and domestic reactionaries and would be to abandon the task of uniting to overthrow the common enemy—the Ne Win military government and liberate the people of all ethnic minorities.

Our country has more than a hundred ethnic minorities. It is obvious that in a country like ours, to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the three great enemies, and to overthrow the representative of these three enemies, the Ne Win military government, we cannot fight separately but must unite and struggle to achieve victory.

Chairman Mao taught us, "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all ethnic minorities within the country are the basic guarantees for the success of our cause."

Our party will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, unite the people of the entire country, unite all ethnic minorities, and strive to completely smash the common enemy, the Ne Win military government. We will establish a new People's Democratic Federal Republic with equal and united ethnic minorities to replace the Ne Win military government.

Our party, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, is correctly solving the national issue. Therefore, the National Democratic United Front has been further consolidated. In the future, we will not only consolidate the existing united front but also unite other ethnic minorities that are waging armed struggles and strive to completely smash the common enemy, the Ne Win military government.

The experience of the revolutionary war in Burma also tells us that to wage a protracted armed struggle, we must mainly rely on our own strength.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "On what basis should our policy be based? It should be based on our own strength, called self-reliance. We are not isolated; all countries and peoples in the world that oppose imperialism are our friends. However, we emphasize self-reliance."

Our party, according to Chairman Mao's teaching, has resolutely carried out armed struggle. The weapons and ammunition in our hands are seized from the enemy by our comrades with the spirit of self-reliance, using their lives and blood.

The spirit of self-reliance is to use the great Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, resolutely rely on the people, propagate, organize, and arm the people, and wage a people's revolutionary war. Therefore, without this ideology, it is impossible to rely on the people, impossible to propagate, organize, and arm the people, not only impossible to achieve victory in armed revolutionary struggles but also impossible to wage a protracted revolutionary war.

Therefore, to wage a protracted armed struggle, we must firmly establish the ideology of self-reliance. This is one of our party's fine traditions and important experiences.

Self-reliance is the main focus, but we do not abandon international aid. We believe that we need to obtain the sympathy and support of the oppressed peoples of the world, especially the sympathy and support of the 700 million Chinese people.

We believe that by relying mainly on self-reliance and also obtaining international sympathy and support, our revolution will develop rapidly.

Whether the revolution can achieve victory depends on which class leads the revolution. Therefore, the most important key issue in the current people's democratic revolution is the issue of the leadership of the Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

We can review the history of Burma. In 1930-1931, the Saya San peasant uprising broke out. At that time, there was no Communist Party, and this peasant uprising lasted for two years and failed.

The current armed revolutionary struggle in Burma has lasted for 20 years. This is the longest armed revolution in Burmese history. At the same time, Burma is also one of the countries with the longest internal war in world history. This is because there is a Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought leading, which can persist in such a protracted armed struggle.

Since 1948, in the history of social development in Burma, there has been a very fierce struggle between two paths and two leaderships. This struggle is still ongoing. One is the leadership of U Nu, Ba U, U Thant, Ne Win, etc., which is the leadership of the bourgeoisie. The other is the leadership of the Communist Party, which is the leadership of the proletariat. From the perspective of historical development, in addition to these two leaderships, there cannot be a third leadership. It is either following the proletariat or following the bourgeoisie.

Today, the most crucial issue of the Burmese revolution is the issue of which class has obtained the leadership of the peasant masses and ethnic minorities. If the bourgeoisie obtains the leadership of the peasant masses and ethnic minorities, the bourgeois dictatorship in Burma will be consolidated; if the proletariat obtains the leadership, it can create conditions for the establishment of a people's democratic dictatorship.

Therefore, in the armed struggle in Burma, the leadership of the Communist Party is a crucial issue.

So, an important experience we have gained is to fully arm the entire party with Mao Zedong Thought, and on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, from the central to the grassroots branches, unite as one in thought, politics, and organization, and use this method to continuously improve the leading role of the party in the revolutionary war.

In conclusion, our party and people's army have now waged a 20-year revolutionary war. The reason we have been able to wage a 20-year armed struggle is that our party, led by Chairman Déqīn Dāndōng, has taken root among the masses, gained the support of the broad masses, and gained the sympathy and support of Marxist-Leninist forces and progressive forces in various countries.

Over the past 20 years, we have experienced many twists and turns. In the protracted armed revolutionary struggle, we have experienced various hardships, sacrifices, and unprecedented losses, and have been tested. We have had failures and victories. In the protracted armed struggle, we have paid the price of blood and sweat and learned some experience of class struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "After crossing the difficult path of war, the road to victory will come, this is the natural logic of war."

Just as Chairman Mao taught, our struggle will definitely follow this natural logic and achieve final victory.

We have already fought for 20 years. If necessary, we can fight for another 20 years or even longer. We have made mental preparations to wage a protracted war until we completely smash the enemy and establish a people's democratic dictatorship in Burma.

Chairman Déqīn Dāndōng teaches us, "We must dare to sacrifice, dare to struggle, and dare to win." We will fight on according to Chairman Déqīn Dāndōng's teachings.

Today, we already have a party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; we have a people's army led by such a party; we have a united front led by such a party, with the participation of various revolutionary classes, ethnic peoples, and patriotic democratic forces. In a word, we have basically obtained the three magic weapons taught by Chairman Mao for achieving victory.

Therefore, we can confidently say that on the road ahead, no matter how many twists and turns we encounter, our armed revolution will definitely achieve final victory.

On the 20th anniversary of the armed revolutionary struggle in Burma, let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and march forward bravely!

Carry the armed struggle of the Burmese people through to the end!

March forward bravely and strive for final victory!

The Burmese people's democratic revolution will surely win!

The Burmese Chiang Kai-shek—Ne Win military government—will surely fail!

All ethnic minorities, unite to oppose the common enemy—the Ne Win military government!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the Communist Party of Burma!

Long live Chairman Déqīn Dāndōng!

Long live the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Long live!

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把缅甸革命武装斗争进行到底！
    ——为纪念缅甸革命武装斗争二十周年而作
    缅甸共产党中央第一副主席　德钦巴登顶
    前言
    缅甸人民的武装革命，到一九六八年三月二十八日，已经整整二十年了。
    一九四八年三月二十八日那一天，统治阶级发动了反动的内战，企图彻底消灭缅甸共产党和进步力量。
    缅甸共产党和人民群众主要依靠自己的力量，以革命的战争反对了反革命的战争。
    列宁教导我们说：“在革命时期千百万人民一个星期内学到的东西，比他们平常在一年糊涂的生活中所学到的还要多。”这是非常正确的。
    二十年来，缅甸的武装斗争经历了种种曲折，克服了种种困难，取得了一定的经验。换句话说，缅甸人民二十年的武装斗争就象一所革命大学，参加革命的同志进了这所学校，他们在政治、思想、军事、组织、经济等各个方面得到了锻炼，培养了艰苦奋斗，为党、为革命、为人民服务和献身的精神。许多党员和战士在实际运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想方面取得了一定的经验。
    二十年来，不少缅共党员、战士和同志牺牲了，他们为党、为革命、为人民贡献了他们的生命。
    每一位牺牲了的同志的工作都已由新的同志接替，革命的队伍就这样不断地以新生力量来补充自己，投入战斗。
    值此缅甸武装斗争二十周年之际，谨代表缅甸共产党中央委员会、代表德钦丹东主席向烈士们致以革命的敬礼！同时，我们保证，我们一定忠于这些先烈，最后完成未竟的革命事业。
    （一）
    在缅甸人民的武装革命斗争二十周年的今天，国际上是一片大好形势。
    震撼世界的伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命空前地加强了世界无产阶级革命的根据地——中华人民共和国的力量。在世界革命人民日益掌握战无不胜的毛泽东思想的情况下，世界无产阶级的革命运动正以磅礴之势日益发展壮大。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，尤其是在东南亚，革命的星星之火已燃烧成燎原之势。英雄的越南人民的抗美救国斗争取得了伟大的胜利。反对美帝国主义斗争的浪潮正在北美、西欧和全世界日益高涨。
    今天，在缅甸，更是一片大好的革命形势。随着革命战争的发展，我们的根据地更加巩固、更加扩大了。在缅甸，东至掸邦，西至若开邦，南至耶、土瓦和丹老，北至密支那，都有革命的根据地。在缅甸二十年革命战争中，我们建立了七个巩固的根据地。
    缅北的上游专区根据地分布在格达、八莫和克钦邦一带。
    西北专区根据地分布在勃科固、敏布和靠近若开山脉地区一带。
    缅中专区根据地控制了大片地区，其中包括彬文那、敏建、密铁拉、曼德勒和掸邦南部等地区。
    若开专区根据地屹立在缅甸西海岸，一直延伸到巴基斯坦边境一带。
    德林达依根据地位于缅甸最南端的沿海一带，它同泰国相毗邻。
    三角洲根据地控制了缅甸大米主要产区。我们党和人民军同革命的克伦族武装一道，正在这个地区向奈温军人政府不断发动进攻，并控制着广大的农村。
    勃固山区根据地遍布于勃固、东坞、因盛、达雅瓦底、卑谬等县，并伸展至缅甸首都仰光附近地区。这个根据地的存在和发展，对敌人形成了不断的威胁，并逐渐形成了对敌人心脏地区的包围形势。
    除了上述巩固的根据地以外，全缅各地有广泛的游击区和战斗区。
    目前，根据地和游击区占全国面积的百分之六十七。一方面，我们的敌人——奈温军人政府以铁路、公路等交通线和城镇为据点，对我根据地形成了包围；另一方面，我们党和人民军以及参加民族民主团结阵线的武装力量活动于全国农村，又以广泛的游击战争对敌人形成了全国范围的反包围。
    缅甸革命战争二十年来，我们的基本力量——党、人民军、地方游击队、民兵等，获得了发展和巩固。
    我们总结了缅甸革命战争二十年来党内两条路线斗争的经验，用毛泽东思想武装了全党，坚决粉碎了党内的现代修正主义，制定了符合当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的纲领、路线和政策。
    缅甸革命战争二十年来，我们不仅同党内的修正主义进行斗争，而且还同国外的修正主义进行了激烈的斗争。比如说，在一九五四年，以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏修领导集团对我们曾经施加过种种压力，要我们放弃武装斗争去同吴努合作；同时，中国赫鲁晓夫也对我们施加压力，要我们放弃武装斗争去同统治集团合作。
    但是，我们党坚持毛泽东思想，坚决地顶住了他们的压力，始终不放弃武装斗争。因此，我们的武装斗争才能坚持二十年之久。
    苏修集团看到迫使我党就范不成，又企图在缅甸建立一个同我们党唱对台戏的共产党。因为人民的反对，他们的卑鄙阴谋没有得逞。
    现在，苏修领导集团公开支持奈温军人反动政府，吹捧奈温的“缅甸社会主义纲领”是什么“走非资本主义道路”。这是对缅甸人民的武装斗争的背叛。
    毛主席说得非常正确：“在目前，反对修正主义的倾向尤其是迫切的任务”。我们的二十年经验证明：如果不集中力量反对修正主义，我们的武装斗争就不可能坚持下来。
    二十年来，我们在党内和党外，在国内和国外，对修正主义进行了多次的长期的斗争，取得了基本胜利。
    如果说我们党领导的二十年武装斗争的历史，就是集中力量打倒修正主义、树立毛泽东思想的历史，那是不会错的。因此，我们的党已经在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来了，并且在缅甸革命战争中更加发挥和加强了党的领导作用。
    接受以毛泽东思想武装起来的党的绝对领导、掌握了毛主席的军事路线的人民军，已经迅速地发展了自己的力量，建立了民兵、地方军和主力军三结合的体制，提高了政治思想水平，加强了官兵团结和军民团结，提高了士气，更加熟练地掌握了游击战和歼灭战。
    与我们党和武装力量发展壮大的同时，党领导下的工农联盟也得到了巩固和进一步的发展。
    我们在农村根据地建立了贫农会和农会（包括贫农和中农），建立了以贫雇农为基础、联合中农的农村人民民主政权，建立了农村人民民主政权的柱石——民兵，打掉了作为奈温军人政府在农村的社会基础的地主和富农的政治势力和地主经济势力（在现阶段先不动富农经济），解散了奈温军人政府在农村的台柱，即“安全行政委员会”、“土地委员会”和“农业综合合作社”，没收了奈温军人政府所谓的“人民商店”的物资，分给农村基本群众。没收和分配“人民商店”物资的群众运动，目前正在继续广泛地发展。
    在相对稳定的三角洲和若开根据地已经开始恢复分地工作。在游击区、战斗区和敌占区则广泛开展争取谷价每百箩五百缅元的斗争，开展反对奈温军队下乡抢米的斗争，开展破坏敌人港口、米厂、交通运输以制止敌人出口大米和解决国内粮食问题的斗争，开展大米不出村、由自己进行互相调剂的斗争，开展抢米分米斗争，开展没收和分配官营木材的斗争，开展没收官方物资的斗争，开展破坏运不了和来不及分配的敌人物资、机器、建筑、桥梁的斗争。
    在党领导下所进行的这些农民斗争，不是单纯的经济斗争，不是单纯为了获取粮食和物资的斗争，而是具有政治性质的群众斗争，是采取适合本地区情况的多种多样的斗争，是把政治、军事和经济结合起来的、给予奈温军人政府以全面沉重打击的斗争。这些斗争是为不断消灭敌人、建立和扩大根据地、建立人民民主政权而服务的，为各地巩固地打下建党、建军和建立统一战线的基础提供了巨大的帮助。
    缅甸革命战争二十年来，我们党在巩固的工农联盟基础上团结了一切可以团结的力量，认真地进行了反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对奈温军人政府的统一战线工作。因此，在我们的基本力量得到迅速发展的同时，我们的统一战线也得到了发展，参加民族民主团结阵线的武装力量也得到了发展。
    我们党在一九五九年同克伦民族团结党、新孟邦党、克耶民族进步党、钦族最高委员会，共同成立民族民主团结阵线，这个阵线在同奈温军人政府的斗争中已经得到了巩固。与我们的基本力量和参加民族民主团结阵线的武装力量得到发展壮大的同时，敌占区的群众运动也得到了发展。
    特别是在粮食危机的情况下，居住在城市的劳苦大众为了解决饥饿问题，纷纷举行游行示威，开展夺粮斗争。若开邦实兑市和谬豪镇的饥饿的群众起来进行夺粮斗争时，遭到了奈温军人政府军队的枪杀，死一百多人，许多人受伤。这个事件发生在一九六七年八月十三日，对全国产生了巨大的影响。工人们因为忍受不了经济困难和压迫，纷纷离开岗位以示抗议，学生也采取各种方式抗议奈温军人政府和学校当局的迫害。这就是说，敌占区各个阶级、各个阶层，正在采取各种方式对奈温军人政府进行斗争。
    （二）
    缅甸革命战争二十年来，由于党和各个革命力量的发展壮大和巩固，统治阶级和奈温军人政府在政治、经济、军事等各个方面一次又一次地面临着困难。
    二十年来，统治阶级利用反动的内战企图消灭我们党和各种革命力量。他们曾叫嚷“自由同盟要执政四十年”。
    不管统治阶级怎样企图消灭我们，我们并没有被消灭，相反，统治阶级由于我们党领导的武装斗争以及它自己内部的矛盾而四分五裂。在这二十年期间，由于国内阶级矛盾的影响以及统治阶级内部的矛盾，造成了执政的自由同盟多次发生分裂，政府多次更迭。
    奈温军人集团执政以来，内部互相倾轧，不断分化。另一方面，在这个时期内，统治阶级实行的一系列的反动政策，引起了阶级矛盾的加剧，这使统治阶级面临政治、经济、军事等各个方面的危机。
    奈温军人集团为了建立军人垄断资本主义制度，公然实行法西斯军人专政，采取了二十年来前所未有的残酷压迫的措施，甚至连过去历届政府所装饰的资产阶级民主这个假面具也不要了。
    奈温军人独裁政府变本加厉地进行反共、反人民、反革命的勾当，迫害和屠杀少数民族。
    这个政府在一九六二年七月七日在仰光开枪打死大学生一百多人，打伤三百多人。这就是世界史上所少有的七月惨案。这是它实行法西斯军人专政的信号。
    这个政府在一九六三年三月二十八日取缔了所有政党和群众团体，实行“社会主义纲领党”一党专政。
    这个政府以保护为名，监禁了几千人，其中包括许多进步人士。它利用美、日、以色列训练出来的一批军事侦探，实行空前的恐怖统治；在监狱里实行最残酷的迫害和屠杀。
    奈温军人政府实行大缅族主义。在其执政的六年多时间内，北至克钦邦、南至丹老、土瓦，对克伦、克钦、掸、勃奥、茵、勃东、孟、克耶、钦、若开、那加、傈僳等缅甸各少数民族实行残酷压迫和剥削；它以军事手段，对正在进行武装革命斗争的各少数民族实行残酷的镇压和屠杀。
    这个政府在各少数民族邦实行军人垄断资本主义统治，使各少数民族人民的政治、社会、经济等各方面的条件空前恶化，他们同缅甸本部的人民群众一样，处于饥饿的困境。
    奈温军人政府实行反动的政策，不仅造成政治危机，而且也造成经济危机。
    在奈温军人集团的军人垄断资本主义统治下，全国生产年年下降。私营小工业和小手工业大批破产。失业人数将近二百万。奈温军人政府的反动土地政策，使广大农民不但受到封建地主的种种剥削，而且还受到官僚资产阶级的惨重剥削。由于生产下降和为了榨取高额利润而对国内贸易实行垄断，全国经济发生混乱，物价飞涨，商品奇缺，以至于人民无米下炊，面临着饥荒。
    执政了六年多的奈温军人独裁政府，也面临着军事危机。
    目前，敌人在军事力量方面占优势，这是事实。但是，敌人不仅在政治和经济上面临着不可克服的矛盾，在军事上也面临着不可克服的矛盾。这些矛盾是：作战任务与守卫城市、交通线任务之间的矛盾；重点进攻我们的党与集中兵力进攻国内各少数民族之间的矛盾；在军事方面需要使用的力量与在经济和行政管理方面使用了很多力量之间的矛盾等等。这些矛盾正在日益发展。敌人兵力不足，处于四面楚歌的境地。
    我党和人民军进行的军事斗争规模更巨大，更激烈，更加具有歼灭战的性质。民族民主团结阵线和其他爱国进步力量也给奈温军人政府以更加沉重的打击。我们取得了越来越大的胜利。甚至在奈温军队控制着的铁路、公路、内河等交通线上和城镇里，也可以听到枪声和爆炸声。
    奈温军人独裁政府从去年八月初就向勃固山脉革命根据地发动了进攻。但是，在德钦丹东主席和党中央的“以进攻粉碎敌人的进攻”这一战斗号召下，我人民军和革命的人民打击和消灭了这些法西斯军队，粉碎了敌人的进攻。
    例如，人民军在卑谬县包康地区多内雅帕贡的战斗中消灭了敌人一个班以上，在敏腊地区全歼了敌人一个班。在仰光—曼德勒和仰光—卑谬铁路干线上，敌人的军车和货车被地雷炸翻。去年十一月二十一日，人民军闪电般地袭击和歼灭了进攻纳德林、只贡地区勃固山麓的以美国自动武器全副武装起来的敌人两个班。今年三月六日，人民军集中了二百人的兵力袭击若开山区的安镇，占领该镇二十四小时，缴获大量武器弹药和日用品，释放了关押在监狱里的犯人，破坏了警察营房、银库、仓库和电讯设备。
    在其他各地，也不断出现歼灭敌人的战斗，我人民军获得了巨大的战绩。
    奈温军人政府的政治、经济和军事危机日益严重，奈温就象坐在即将爆炸的地雷之上。
    为了摆脱这些危机，奈温军人政府加紧反共、反人民、反革命，进一步镇压和屠杀各族人民。
    统治阶级在他们遇到全面危机、处于奄奄一息的时候，为了摆脱危机，就使出他们惯用的手法，这就是阴险地利用宗教来攻击缅甸共产党和进步力量。
    一九五八年，统治阶级提出所谓“宗教危机”来反对和攻击我们的党。但是，具有革命传统和丰富经验的缅甸人民识破了统治阶级利用宗教的卑鄙阴谋，没有上他们的当。
    奈温军人政府的反动政策，给人民带来了前所未有的痛苦，引起了人民的极大的愤怒。现在奈温军人政府为了转移视线，又提出所谓的“宗教危机”，利用宗教来攻击我们党。但是，这一次一定会象上一次那样，遭到人民群众的反击。
    不久以前，奈温军人政府为了摆脱危机，从狱中释放了在缅甸政治界一贯表现反动的巴莫、觉迎、昂基和封建土司，并造谣说，他们也释放了共产党人。他们这样做的目的，就是要在“保卫联邦”、“全民团结”、“消灭国内外的叛乱者”、“反华”的骗人口号下，联合一切右派和反动派，进一步掀起反共、反人民、镇压和屠杀少数民族、破坏革命以及反华的浪潮。
    在国际上，奈温军人政府为了摆脱危机，正在进一步反华。它更多地接受美帝国主义的援助，同美帝国主义进一步勾结。奈温于一九六六年九月亲自去拜访他的主子美帝头子约翰逊，恬不知耻地说：“我在亚洲反共最卖力”。这就是说，他保证要最大限度地出卖国家和人民。因此，美帝国主义也就同意再给奈温军人政府以金钱、武器和技术的援助。一个很明显的例子是，去年美帝国主义卖步枪给奈温，每支只收美元二十五分。
    一贯反对缅甸共产党和缅甸革命，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，反对中国和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命斗争的苏联修正主义领导集团，也加紧同奈温军人政府勾结。苏修集团给奈温军人政府一轮船的武器援助，就是一个明显的例证。
    同时，奈温军人政府还加紧同日本反动派勾结。不久以前，奈温军人政府派了一个军事代表团到日本购买武器。不仅如此，它过去和现在都企图同缅甸境内的蒋介石残匪勾结，反对我们的党、我们的人民军和中华人民共和国。
    奈温军人政府加紧投靠美帝、苏修和国内外反动派，极力出卖缅甸联邦和缅甸人民。它不但不能解决各方面的困难，相反，困难必将日益加重。
    今天，全国正面临着种种政治、经济和社会的困难，各阶级、各阶层和各族人民对奈温军人政府恨得要死。今天，在缅甸，奈温军人政府就是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三大敌人的代表。它背叛民族利益，极力出卖整个缅甸联邦。它是美帝、苏修和国内外反动派的走卒，是制造种种灾难的罪魁祸首。各族人民日益看清了奈温军人政府的反动真面目。
    在目前的形势下，摆脱种种危机的唯一出路，就是打倒帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义这三大敌人的代表——奈温军人政府。为此，就必须建立一个包括工人、农民、小资产阶级、少数民族、爱国资本家和其他民主力量在内的、广泛的反对奈温军人政府的统一战线。
    在革命的现阶段，我党的历史任务是，依靠这个统一战线的力量，解放全缅甸，建立一个以各革命阶级和革命的少数民族为基础的、完全独立、民主、繁荣、和平幸福的、各民族平等团结的、新的人民民主联邦共和国。
    （三）
    我们党在缅甸二十年的革命战争中，取得了一定的经验教训。在一九六七年建党二十八周年的时候，曾阐述了某些经验教训。在我党中央关于武装斗争二十周年的声明中，也阐述了某些经验教训。本文想阐述以下一些主要的经验教训。
    一、缅甸武装革命的最重要的经验教训是：当我们党把毛泽东思想和缅甸革命实践相结合的时候，革命就取得胜利；违背或放弃毛泽东思想的时候，革命就遭受失败。当我们党坚定不移地遵循中国革命（十月革命的继续）道路的时候，革命就取得胜利；违背或放弃中国革命道路的时候，革命就遭受失败和损失。
    当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席教导说：
  “枪杆子里面出政权”，“离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”
    缅甸的革命实践已经清楚地证明，毛主席教导我们的这一普遍真理具有强大的威力，是十分正确的。实践证明，谁违背毛主席的这一教导，或对这一教导产生动摇，谁就在革命战争中遭到损失和失败。
    当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席教导我们，要实行建立农村根据地、农村包围城市的战略，走通过持久的人民战争夺取政权的道路。
    缅甸的革命历史已经清楚地证明这一教导的无比正确性，并证明违背这一教导就要受到挫折和失败。
    我们党早在一九四九年二月就作出决定，不仅要把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，而且也要把毛泽东同志的学说，作为我们的指导方针。在今天，仅仅采取这一态度已经不够了。因此，我们党确定了一个对毛泽东思想的完整的正确的态度。
    毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。
    因此，反对毛泽东思想，就是反对马克思列宁主义。谁口头上接受马克思列宁主义，而在实际上拒绝接受毛泽东思想，谁就是一个机会主义者，修正主义者。
    毛泽东思想是缅甸一切革命工作的指导方针。毛泽东同志关于无产阶级政党的建设、人民军队的建设、人民战争的理论，更是缅甸革命胜利的指路明灯。
    对一个无产阶级革命者来说，或者对一个无产阶级革命事业的接班人来说，首要的和最基本的条件是，学习和紧紧掌握毛泽东思想，忠实地运用毛泽东思想，要用毛泽东思想挂帅。
    因此，我们党将在党内和国际共产主义运动中，同一切反对毛泽东思想的人进行坚决的斗争。
    二、现在谈谈缅甸革命的两个主要关键问题。第一个问题是农民问题，是土地革命问题。第二个问题是少数民族问题。只有正确地很好地解决这两个问题，缅甸革命才能胜利。
    缅甸武装革命证明，在落后的农业经济占统治地位的、农民占全国人口的大多数的缅甸，只有依靠农民群众，宣传、组织和武装农民群众，解决农民问题，才能进行持久的革命战争，并取得胜利。
    农民占缅甸人口的百分之八十以上。农民身受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的三重压迫和剥削。因此，农民对于反帝、反封建、反对执政的资产阶级集团的斗争和土地革命，有极高的积极性，并坚决投入斗争。在以德钦丹东主席为首的我们党领导下，目前所进行的人民民主革命的主要轴心是土地革命。在人民民主革命中，对农民斗争的领导，对土地革命斗争的领导，是我们党的基本任务，只有坚决进行土地革命，目前的革命才能取得胜利。
    毛主席指出，农民是无产阶级最可靠和最广大的同盟者，是革命战争的主力军。
    因此，人民民主革命，就是工人阶级领导的农民战争。人民军的来源主要是农民。进行长期战争所需要的物力财力也是来自农民。
    因此，缅甸革命战争充分证明，只要按照毛主席的指示，真正依靠农民，解决农民问题，进行土地革命，就能坚持长期战争，并为夺取最后胜利创造基本条件。
      三、根据缅甸革命战争的经验，正确解决少数民族问题，是取得革命胜利的一个重要关键。
      缅甸并不是一个只有缅族的国家，而是居住着克钦、克伦、克耶、钦、缅、孟、掸、若开、勃奥等一
  百多个民族的国家。
      少数民族虽然遍布全国，但他们主要聚居于边界，
  而这些地区的面积约占缅甸全国面积的三分之二，人
  口占全国人口的百分之四十五左右。
    缅甸资产阶级同英帝国主义妥协并攫取政权后，二十年来统治阶级不仅残酷地压迫和剥削缅族人民，而且实行大缅族主义，残酷地压迫和剥削各少数民族。少数民族不堪忍受执政资产阶级实行的大缅族主义的压迫和剥削，纷纷拿起武器，反对统治阶级。克伦、克钦、若开、孟、茵、勃奥、克耶、钦、掸等少数民族，正在进行长期的武装斗争。
    因此，各少数民族的武装斗争是争取完全的民族平等和民族自决权的问题。它是在缅甸全国范围内进行的人民民主革命的重要组成部分。
    今天，缅甸的各少数民族处在不同的政治、经济发展阶段。阶级分化的程度也不同。为了正确地解决民族问题，我们必须掌握这个问题的阶级实质。斯大林同志教导我们说，“民族问题的基础，它的内在实质仍然是农民问题”。
    毛主席也教导我们说，“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”
    今天，在缅甸发生的各民族的武装革命，实质上是农民问题。根据我党的经验，正确领导和解决民族问题，是在工人阶级领导下，结成工人阶级和农民阶级的联盟问题。因此，正确解决民族问题，是革命胜利的一个非常重要的环节。
    实行资产阶级大缅族主义的奈温军人政府，无论如何也不能解决当前缅甸的民族问题。只有坚持无产阶级民族团结政策的缅甸共产党，才能正确解决这个问题。
    我党主张，缅甸各民族一律平等。在政治、经济、社会、文化等各方面都必须有平等权利。各民族都必须有充分的民族自决权，都必须有充分的民族自治权利。
    马克思列宁主义者认为，民族自决权是各民族固有的权利，而且认为这个民族自决权包括有分离权。
    所谓分离权，并不意味着另外建立一个小国家，而是反对一切民族压迫，主张各民族一律平等、团结和合作。
    关于这个问题，列宁同志教导我们说，所谓民族自决权，“并不等于分离、分散、成立小国家的要求，它只是反对一切民族压迫的彻底表现。”
    列宁同志又教导我们说，我们提出民族自决权，
  “决不是为了‘提倡’实行分离，相反地，是为了促进和加速各民族的民主的亲近和融合。”
      当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席，在民族问题上创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。他明确地提出，“承认中国境内各少数民族有平等自治的权利”，
  “赞成平等的联合，而不赞成互相压迫”。所谓民族自治，是指从乡一级到省一级的自治。
      毛主席的这个英明正确的论断，不仅对中国，而且对缅甸的具体情况，也是完全适用的。
    在实行大缅族主义的奈温军人专政制度下，所谓
  “国内各民族的亲善和团结”已经完全不存在了。
      一个民族用枪口对准另一个民族，而口头上又说什么亲善呀，团结呀，这纯粹是无耻的欺骗。
      因此，我党坚决反对奈温军人政府以大缅族主义的态度对少数民族进行的武装镇压。同时，我们也坚决反对帝国主义及其追随者分裂缅甸的企图。
    在目前情况下，如果提出分离和建立独立国的口
  号，那就是迎合帝国主义和国内反动派的需要，那就
  是放弃了团结一致打倒人民公敌——奈温军人政府、解放各族人民的任务。
    我国有一百多个民族。很明显，象我们这样的国家，要打倒帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三大敌人，打倒这三个敌人的代表奈温军人政府，不能各打各的，只能团结一致，进行斗争，才能获得胜利。
    毛主席教导我们说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”
    我党一定要遵照毛主席的教导，团结全国人民，团结各民族，为彻底打垮人民公敌奈温军人政府而奋斗。我们要建立一个各民族平等、团结的新的人民民主联邦共和国，以代替奈温军人政府。
    我党用毛泽东思想挂帅，正在正确地解决民族问题。因此，民族民主团结阵线已经获得进一步的巩固。今后，我们不但将巩固现有的统一战线，而且将团结其他正在进行武装斗争的少数民族，为最后打倒人民公敌奈温军人政府而奋斗。
    四、缅甸革命战争的经验还告诉我们，进行持久的武装斗争必须主要依靠自己的力量。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。我们并不孤立，全世界一切反对帝国主义的国家和人民都是我们的朋友。但是我们强调自力更生”。
    我党按照毛主席的这个教导，坚决地进行了武装斗争。我们手里的武器和弹药，是我们的同志以自力更生的精神，用生命和鲜血从敌人手里夺来的。
    自力更生的精神，就是用伟大的毛泽东思想挂帅，坚决依靠人民，宣传、组织和武装人民，进行人民革命战争。因此，如果没有这种思想，就不可能依靠人民，不可能宣传、组织和武装人民，不但不可能取得武装革命斗争的胜利，也不可能进行持久的革命战争。
    因此，为了进行持久的武装斗争，必须牢牢树立自力更生的思想。这是我党的一个优良的传统和重要的经验。
    自力更生是主要的，但我们也不放弃国际援助。我们认为，我们需要取得世界上被压迫人民的同情和支持，尤其需要七亿中国人民的同情和支持。
    我们相信，以自力更生为主，同时也取得国际的同情和支持，我们的革命将会得到迅速的发展。
    五、革命能不能取得胜利，取决于这个革命由那一个阶级来领导。因此，目前进行的人民民主革命的最重要的关键问题，是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党的领导问题。
      可以回顾一下缅甸历史。一九三○——一九三一年爆发了沙耶山农民起义。当时还没有共产党，结果这次农民起义持续了两年以后失败了。
      目前在缅甸进行的革命武装斗争，已经有二十年了。这是缅甸历史上时间最长的武装革命。同时缅甸也是世界历史上内战持续最长的国家之一。这是因为有了一个用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党的领导，才能坚持这样持久的武装斗争。
      一九四八年以来，在缅甸社会发展史上，展开了两条道路、两个领导的非常激烈的斗争。这个斗争目前还在持续。一个是吴努、巴瑞、觉迎、奈温等人的
  领导，这是资产阶级的领导。另一种是共产党的领导，
  是无产阶级的领导。根据历史发展来看，除了这两种
  领导以外，再不可能有第三种领导。不是跟着无产阶级走，就是跟着资产阶级走。
    今天，缅甸革命的最关键的问题，是那一个阶级取得了对农民群众和少数民族的领导权的问题。如果资产阶级取得了对农民群众和少数民族的领导权，缅甸的资产阶级专政将会巩固下去；如果是无产阶级取得了领导权，就可以为建立人民民主专政创造条件。
    因此，在缅甸的武装斗争中，共产党的领导权是一个最关键的问题。
    所以，我们取得的一个十分重要的经验是，用毛泽东思想充分武装全党，在毛泽东思想的基础上，从中央到基层支部，从思想上、政治上和组织上团结一致，用这个方法不断提高党在革命战争中的领导作用。
          结束语
    我党和人民军现在已经进行了二十年的革命战争了。我们之所以能进行二十年的武装斗争，是因为以德钦丹东主席为首的我们的党，已经在人民群众中扎下了根，得到了广大人民群众的拥护，得到了各国马克思列宁主义力量和进步力量的同情和支持。
    二十年来，我们经历了许多曲折和起伏。在持久的武装革命斗争中，经历了种种困苦、牺牲和前所未有的损失，经受了考验。我们有过失败，也有过胜利。我们在持久的武装斗争中，付出了血和汗的代价，学到了一定的阶级斗争的经验。
    毛主席教导我们：“跨过战争的艰难路程之后，胜利的坦途就到来了，这是战争的自然逻辑。”
    正如毛主席所教导的那样，我们的斗争也必定会按照这种自然逻辑，取得最后胜利。
    我们已经打了二十年了。如果需要，我们还可以再打二十年或者更长的时间。我们已经做好思想准备，进行持久战，直至彻底打垮敌人，在缅甸建立人民民主专政。
    德钦丹东主席教导我们说：“要敢于牺牲，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。”我们将按照德钦丹东主席的教导，坚决战斗下去。
    今天，我们已经有了用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党；有了一支由这样的党领导的人民军；有了一个由这样的党领导的，各革命阶级、各族人民、爱国的民主力量参加的统一战线。一句话，我们已经基本上有了毛主席教导的取得胜利的三大法宝。
      因此，我们可以肯定地说，在前进的道路上，不管还会遇到多少曲折和起伏，我们的武装革命一定会取得最后的胜利。
    在缅甸武装革命斗争已满二十周年的今天，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋勇前进！
    把缅甸人民的革命武装斗争进行到底！
    奋勇前进，争取最后胜利！
    缅甸人民民主革命必胜！
    缅甸的蒋介石——奈温军人政府必败！
    各民族团结起来，反对共同敌人——奈温军人政府！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    缅甸共产党万岁！
    德钦丹东主席万岁！
    世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
