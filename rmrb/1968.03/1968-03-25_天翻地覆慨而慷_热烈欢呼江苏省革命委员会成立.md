In the current favorable situation, news of another great victory has come from the southeastern part of our motherland: under the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born! This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

With boundless joy, we extend our warmest congratulations to the heroic Jiangsu proletarian revolutionary factions and the 47 million people of Jiangsu, and to the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Jiangsu who have made outstanding contributions in the "three supports, two militaries" work!

Jiangsu is a key region in southeastern China. The revolutionary people of Jiangsu have long, arduous, and repeated struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The Kuomintang reactionaries of Chiang Kai-shek once made Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu, their lair for bloody counter-revolutionary rule, but it was finally destroyed by our great People's Liberation Army in April 1949. This great victory ushered in a new era of socialist revolution and socialist construction for the people of Jiangsu. However, class struggle has not ended. Imperialism, the landlord class, the bourgeoisie, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, using China's Khrushchev and other top capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Jiangsu, have been relentlessly pushing the revisionist line and plotting counter-revolutionary restoration. The establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee marks the shattering of the capitalist restoration dream of China's Khrushchev and his agents Jiang Yiqing and Chen Guang, and it deals another heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and their running dogs. "The tiger crouches, the dragon coils, today's victory surpasses the past; the earth shakes and the heavens rejoice, the times are tumultuous and stirring." A new, brilliant page in Jiangsu's history has been turned.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength, and not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." Chairman Mao's great teaching points out the direction of our advance. In this current favorable situation, we must never forget class struggle.

The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gets to complete victory, the more acute and complex the class struggle becomes. Although the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have been overthrown, they will undoubtedly continue to use various despicable and vile means to sabotage. From the very first day of its establishment, the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. It must hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev and the top handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Jiangsu, Jiang Yiqing and Chen Guang, and expose and criticize them thoroughly. It must thoroughly purge the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. It must unleash the mighty power of the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthen military-civilian unity, maintain high vigilance, and together fight the enemy, thoroughly exposing spies, traitors, diehard capitalist-roaders, and all open or covert counter-revolutionaries.

At every critical moment in the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangsu, it is the great leader Chairman Mao who has pointed out the direction of our victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for attacking class enemies; following Chairman Mao is victory! The newly born Jiangsu Revolutionary Committee must place the study, implementation, propagation, and defense of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all its work. It must continue to vigorously establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fight selfishness, criticize revisionism, and promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. It must continue to promote and consolidate revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units. It must strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism. It must resolutely oppose the erroneous tendencies of mountainism and sectarianism, and seriously implement Chairman Mao's teaching: "We all come from the lakes and seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." No matter where the revolutionary comrades come from, they must unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought principles, under the common goal of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary committee must truly become an organ with proletarian revolutionary authority, and unleash the mighty power of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

"The heavens, if they have feelings, will also age; the right way in the world is change." Jiangsu has advanced again in the storm of revolution! We wish the people of Jiangsu, following the great helmsman Chairman Mao, to grasp the revolution and promote production, and achieve even greater victories to report to our great leader Chairman Mao, and seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    天翻地覆慨而慷
    ——热烈欢呼江苏省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    在当前大好形势下，从祖国的东南又传来了新的喜讯：在伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲切关怀下，江苏省革命委员会胜利诞生了！这是毛泽东思想的又一个伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一个伟大胜利！
    我们怀着无限喜悦的心情，向英雄的江苏省无产阶级革命派和四千七百万江苏人民，向在“三支”“两军”工作中立下卓越功勋的中国人民解放军驻江苏部队广大指战员，表示最热烈的祝贺！
    江苏是我国东南的重镇。江苏革命人民同帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义进行了长期的、反复的、艰巨的斗争。蒋介石国民党反动派曾经把江苏省会南京，作为他们进行血腥的反革命统治的巢穴，终于在一九四九年四月间被我们伟大的人民解放军所摧毁。这个伟大的胜利，使江苏省人民进入了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新时代。但是，阶级斗争并没有结束。帝国主义、地主阶级、资产阶级、国民党反动派，他们利用中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其在江苏的代理人，竭力推行修正主义路线，进行反革命复辟的阴谋活动。江苏省革命委员会的成立，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人江渭清、陈光之流在江苏省复辟资本主义黄粱美梦的破灭，给了帝国主义、现代修正主义及其走狗又一个沉重的打击。“虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”江苏省的历史又揭开了光辉灿烂的一页。
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”毛主席这一伟大教导，指明了我们前进的方向。在当前大好形势下，我们千万不能忘记阶级斗争。
    无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越尖锐复杂。党内一小撮走资派虽然被打倒了，但是，他们必然要不断利用各种卑鄙恶劣的手段，进行破坏。江苏省革命委员会从成立的第一天起，就必须牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，要高举革命批判大旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在江苏的代理人江渭清、陈光等批深批透，批倒批臭。要彻底肃清反革命修正主义路线的流毒。要发挥无产阶级专政的强大威力，大力加强军民团结，保持高度警惕，共同对敌，彻底揭露特务、叛徒、顽固不化的走资派和一切公开或隐蔽的反革命分子。
    在江苏省无产阶级文化大革命发展的每一个关键时刻，都是伟大领袖毛主席为我们指出了胜利前进的方向。毛泽东思想是向阶级敌人进攻最锐利的武器，紧跟毛主席就是胜利！新生的江苏革命委员会，必须把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想，放在一切工作的首位。必须继续大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，斗私，批修，促进人的思想革命化，继续促进和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好各单位的斗、批、改。要增强无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义。要坚决反对山头主义、宗派主义的错误倾向，认真执行毛主席教导：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”不管来自什么山头的革命同志，都要在毛泽东思想原则基础上，在贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的共同目标下，团结起来。要使革命委员会真正成为有无产阶级革命权威的机关，发挥出无产阶级专政的强大威力。
      “天若有情天亦老，人间正道是沧桑。”江苏在革命的风暴中又前进了！我们预祝江苏人民紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，狠抓革命，猛促生产，以更大的胜利向我们伟大领袖毛主席报喜，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
