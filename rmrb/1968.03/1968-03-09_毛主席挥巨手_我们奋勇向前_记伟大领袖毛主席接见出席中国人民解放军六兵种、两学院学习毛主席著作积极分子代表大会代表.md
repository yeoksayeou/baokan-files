Respected Chairman Mao has arrived, and we cheer a thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!

The news shakes the heavens, and our blood surges like a tide.

The most blessed moment is about to arrive, and the most beautiful wish is about to be realized!

On the afternoon of March 7, 1968, representatives of the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the six military branches and two academies of the People's Liberation Army gathered in the Great Hall of the People. They came from the towering peaks of the world, from the vast forests and snowy plains, from the borders and coastal defenses of the motherland, and from the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militant" campaigns. They brought the boundless love and loyalty of millions of soldiers to Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao has arrived! Chairman Mao has arrived! Chairman Mao has arrived!

Respected Chairman Mao, with a radiant face and a vigorous stride, is walking towards us!

Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Central Committee members Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, and Yao Wenyuan are walking towards us!

Millions of excited hearts fly towards Chairman Mao, millions of hands holding red books are raised towards Chairman Mao, and millions of eyes filled with tears of joy gaze at Chairman Mao. Millions of people shout in unison:

"Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao forever!"

Bo Dongrui's former comrade-in-arms and battle hero Wang Shunyi, the "Iron Soldier" of the Railway Corps Zhang Chunyu, and former volunteer army battle hero Zheng Dingfu are shouting with joy!

Those who have been awarded first-class merit, such as Ge Caifu, Wang Kejing, Liu Yue'an, Liang Zhaonian, Jin Kebin, Peng Zuxun, Tong Weizhi, Lin Huanqing, Hu Nianyin, LÃ¼ Jilan, and He Weihua, are shouting with joy!

Representatives of advanced collectives such as the class of Lei Feng, the class of Wang Jie, the company of Yang Liandi, the Fourth Company of a certain artillery unit that has been awarded first-class merit, the Engineering Company of a certain armored unit, the First Company of a certain engineering unit, the Fifth Company of a certain communications unit, and the Seventh Company of a certain chemical defense unit are shouting with joy!

Shout, shout! All the representatives are shouting joyfully, shouting with all their hearts!

In this joyous sea, the soldier Liu Jianlie from a certain artillery unit is particularly excited. How much he loves Chairman Mao, how much he misses Chairman Mao! During a mission, when he was seriously injured and his life was in danger, he still shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" He was in a coma for forty-five days, and the first words he uttered when he woke up were, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Today, he sees with his own eyes that the respected great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, is in excellent health and full of energy. How can his shout not be particularly loud!

In this joyous sea, a young soldier from the Railway Corps, Chen Qihui, is crying tears of joy and repeatedly jumps up to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live forever!" This Yi ethnic soldier from the border, when he set out for Beijing, heard that more than ninety Yi villagers immediately sewed in the light of a pine oil lamp all night long, and embroidered nine shining golden characters on a piece of bright red cloth, "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life," and entrusted Chen Qihui to present it to Chairman Mao. They repeatedly instructed, "The Yi people will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao. When you see Chairman Mao, you must shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' for us many times." Now, Chen Qihui is shouting on behalf of the Yi people and all ethnic groups, sincerely wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

In this joyous sea, the representative of the support-left personnel from the Beijing Foreign Language Printing Plant of the Artillery Headquarters wipes away his tears of joy again and again, gazing affectionately at Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the Lenin of our time, the banner of the era, and the people of the world love you dearly! In their support-left work at the Beijing Foreign Language Printing Plant, they saw millions of letters from revolutionary people around the world, requesting Chairman Mao's revolutionary books, enthusiastically praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and sincerely wishing the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, eternal life! To meet the demands of the world's revolutionary people, they worked with the revolutionary masses of the plant to print batch after batch of Chairman Mao's books. Today, they cannot contain their excitement and shout joyfully over and over again: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!

"Long live Chairman Mao!" This is the voice from the hearts of all the soldiers and officers of the army, this is the voice from the hearts of all the ethnic groups of the country, this is the voice from the hearts of all the revolutionary people of the world. This voice is like thunder, echoing through the sky, shaking the globe!

Respected Chairman Mao inspects us, and we shout joyfully: Victory belongs to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

The mountains dance, and the blue sky laughs.

Respected leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, are inspecting us!

Chairman Mao stands on the rostrum, smiling kindly at the entire audience, waving frequently, and clapping warmly.

Vice Chairman Lin leads us in raising high the red books, and instantly, a surging red sea shines with countless rays of light.

Chairman Mao inspects the representatives of the active learners of his works and the advanced collectives from the six military branches. The representatives, with tears of joy streaming down their faces and surging emotions, shout joyfully: Respected Chairman Mao, all glory belongs to you, all victories belong to your brilliant thoughts! We study and apply your thoughts in our preparations for war; in the "Three Supports, Two Militant" campaigns, we study and apply your thoughts, with red hearts and clear eyes, knowing the direction; in construction, we study and apply your thoughts, with unyielding spirit to move mountains and fill seas; in production, we study and apply your thoughts, becoming pioneers to change the sky and earth!

Chairman Mao's good cadre Yu Chun, the representative of the heroic collective with unyielding spirit and red bones, Tao Naixing, the soldier like Yu Yangjun, Shi Futing, and Deng Anwen, they look at Chairman Mao smiling and clapping for them, and their emotions surge like waves. Tears of joy fill their eyes, and they are particularly excited: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is your brilliant thoughts that nurture us to grow. With your brilliant thoughts, we can climb mountains of knives and make steel blades blunt; we can enter fires and make the flames extinguish; we can fight demons and make them flee in terror; we can kill enemies and make them perish!

The Twelfth Company of a certain communications unit, to ensure smooth communication, they "resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." On the vast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the surging Yellow River, they erected telephone lines, creating astonishing miracles. Today, their representative Liu Xiuzhong, seeing Chairman Mao clapping and smiling warmly, is extremely excited, waving the red book he reads every day during construction, with surging emotions: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the face of such dangerous engineering projects, it is your brilliant thoughts that gave us the heroic spirit to overcome all obstacles, the wisdom and strength to conquer natural hazards!

The Tenth Company of a certain engineering unit, which has been fighting hard on the windy and snowy plateau for eighteen years, has been following Chairman Mao's teaching to "continue to maintain the spirit of hard work and plain living" since the founding of the People's Republic of China. They have been carrying their simple equipment, stained with the smoke of the battlefield, and walking on a new Long March. From the plateau to the Gobi Desert, from the snow-capped mountains to the grasslands, they have conquered treacherous mountains and rivers, and overcome scorching heat and bitter cold. Wherever they are needed, they pitch their tents and settle down. The soldiers say, "Standing on the mountain, looking at Beijing, a red sun rises in our hearts, singing 'The East is Red' loudly, our red hearts forever with Chairman Mao!" Today, their representative Wang Songhai, looking at Chairman Mao smiling and clapping warmly, has a thousand words in his heart: Respected Chairman Mao, your thoughts are the most powerful, the soldiers armed with your thoughts have the hardest bones, your thoughts can melt thousands of years of ice and snow, and can transform tens of thousands of years of desert into a new look!

Chairman Mao inspects the representatives of the units participating in nuclear weapon tests. The representatives, looking at Chairman Mao smiling and clapping warmly for them, are filled with excitement and joy: Respected Chairman Mao, even if there were a million thunderbolts, they would not be as powerful as your thoughts. Gathering the light of the universe would not be as bright as your thoughts. Your brilliant thoughts are an invincible spiritual atomic bomb. With your thoughts, we can create more and better material atomic bombs! We can create any miracle on earth!

Chairman Mao inspects the representatives of the Higher Military Academy and the Political Academy. The representatives, with boiling blood, shout joyfully: Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, making a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought! "Remembering the past, the years were full of ups and downs." In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, dared to fight, and were good at fighting. They have made new contributions to defending the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Looking at Chairman Mao's kind smile, they say excitedly: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your great works are the priceless treasures of the revolution, your brilliant thoughts are the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, and they are very typical in concentrating and developing the excellent thoughts of humanity. Mastering your thoughts, we have direction, wisdom, and strength! We can "sweep away all harmful creatures and have no enemies"!

Respected Chairman Mao, you smile kindly at us, wave frequently, and clap warmly. This is the greatest encouragement for us! We will definitely take Vice Chairman Lin as a brilliant example, hold high your great red flag of thoughts, learn your great thoughts better, and better! Our minds will be armed with your thoughts, our souls will be tempered red with your thoughts, our hearts will beat for loyalty to you, and our blood will flow for loyalty to you!

Respected Chairman Mao is with us, and we will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao!

The sun is the reddest, and the Big Dipper is the brightest.

Respected Chairman Mao walks vigorously from the south end of the rostrum to the north end and then to the middle, standing tall before us. His concerned gaze sweeps from left to right, from right to left, from the upper floor to the lower floor, and from the lower floor to the upper floor. He looks and looks again, and every soldier is in his heart!

Respected Chairman Mao's concerned gaze is like the rays of the rising sun, making our blood boil and our hearts bloom. Millions of eyes gaze at the great leader Chairman Mao, and millions of red hearts are closer and closer to Chairman Mao! Tears of joy, do not flow out! Let us take a good look at the reddest sun in our hearts, and let us forever and forever engrave the brilliant image of the great leader Chairman Mao in our hearts!

The old Red Army soldier Su Dayuan, who always maintains revolutionary youth, the representative of the military training team at Beijing Shijingshan Middle School, Zhang Fengqi, who seriously implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the model soldier who loves soldiers, Yang Deming, who always acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the cadre Zhang Yongchang, who is a good soldier of Chairman Mao, Kang Liande, the former comrade-in-arms of Wang Shucheng, the young soldiers who have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, such as Li Enjiang, Gao Wensheng, Hou Suotang, Zhou Chucheng, Yan Xianglin, Fang Lilin, Li Zhaocai, Li Yingquan, Xie Zilong, Wu Yixian, Zheng Xinghe, and the happiest people standing in front of Chairman Mao. They burst out a common voice from the bottom of their hearts: Respected Chairman Mao, your soldiers will forever be loyal to you and forever follow you closely. Whatever you say, we will definitely do it!

The practicing researcher Ding Xiuzhen from a certain chemical defense unit is the happiest person standing in front of Chairman Mao. She listens to Chairman Mao the most. Chairman Mao calls on intellectuals to follow the road of integrating with workers and peasants, so she takes workers as her teachers and works with peasants to temper her thoughts to be redder. Chairman Mao calls on you to "care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" She strives to learn the revolutionary spirit of the working class and bravely and firmly fights against counter-revolutionary revisionists, undergoing the tempering and testing of class struggle. Now, she is bathed in the glory of the red sun and has many heartfelt words to tell Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! I will definitely listen to you and use your thoughts to guide my soul, fight against selfishness, and criticize revisionism. In the great storms, I will stand firm and forever be with you heart to heart!

The representative of the support-left personnel from the Materials Department of the Jumen Oil Management Bureau of a certain engineering unit is the happiest person standing in front of Chairman Mao. The support-left personnel act immediately upon Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao says, "Carry out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good." They do painstaking and detailed ideological and political work for the two revolutionary mass organizations, achieving a revolutionary great alliance of the two major factions that had been fighting each other for a long time. They say excitedly, "Respected Chairman Mao, we will definitely study your latest instructions seriously and implement them without distortion!"

The representative of the military training team from the Fifth Middle School in Changchun of a certain armored unit is the happiest person standing in front of Chairman Mao. They resolutely implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" instructions, hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and take "criticize selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline. They overcome the impact and interference of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies and develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance based on teaching classes, achieving the return to classes and making a revolution. They say excitedly: Respected Chairman Mao, implementing your latest instructions, the most important thing is the word "use." No matter how much interference or risk we encounter, we will definitely use it unconditionally.

The representative of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from a certain railway unit in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang, is the happiest person standing in front of Chairman Mao. This propaganda team resolutely implements the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, regards both factions of revolutionary masses as their class brothers, and regardless of which faction, if it conforms to Chairman Mao's instructions, they support it resolutely; if it does not conform to Chairman Mao's instructions, they help them correct it enthusiastically. Thus, both factions of revolutionary masses advance victoriously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They say excitedly: Respected Chairman Mao, you stand the highest and see the farthest. Your latest instructions are the sharpest weapons to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will definitely implement them item by item, layer by layer, and comprehensively!

All the representatives standing closely in front of Chairman Mao are immersed in unbounded happiness. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your concerned gaze, we will never forget! Your concerned gaze is forever the force that inspires us to move forward! At this most unforgettable and exciting moment, with hearts full of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to you, we solemnly swear to you, the reddest sun in our hearts: We will forever be loyal to you and forever be with you heart to heart! Your brilliant thoughts, we praise them everywhere, your great works, we study them every day, your latest instructions, we follow them to the letter, your great strategic deployments, we follow them resolutely!

Respected Chairman Mao waves his giant hand to us, and we charge forward bravely!

Red light shines in all directions, and colorful clouds fill the sky.

Respected Chairman Mao looks at us with a smiling face and waves his giant hand to us.

Respected Chairman Mao, your hand is the giant hand that supports the heavens, the giant hand that turns the world upside down, the giant hand that steers the ship of the Chinese and world revolution! On the banks of the Xiangjiang River, you waved your giant hand, awakening millions of workers and peasants to fight corruption and bind the dragon; on Jinggangshan, you waved your giant hand, creating the first people's army and opening up the first red base area; in Yan'an, you waved your giant hand, mobilizing millions of troops to defeat the Japanese invaders and bury the Chiang Kai-shek regime; on Tiananmen, you personally raised the first five-star red flag, and our great motherland stands tall in the East like a giant; in the holy land of the world revolutionâBeijing, you waved your giant hand, launching the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and thoroughly shattering the beautiful dream of the capitalist restoration by the handful of capitalist roaders within the party led by the Chinese Khrushchev; today, under the unprecedented good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you wave your giant hand to us, calling on us to redouble our efforts, strive to be the best, and win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, guiding us to march towards the wonderful communism!

Respected Chairman Mao, you wave your giant hand to us, hoping that we will forever walk the revolutionary road of emphasizing proletarian politics. The representatives of the First Company of a certain engineering unit that bravely defends Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, the Fourth Tank Company of a certain armored unit that holds high the great red flag of Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought, and the medical team of a certain chemical defense unit that sincerely serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers, promise you: Respected Chairman Mao, we will definitely hold higher your great red flag of military thought, always put studying and applying your brilliant thoughts in the first place in all our work, insist on the four firsts, carry forward the spirit of March 8th, launch the movement of the four good companies, and turn the company into a red Mao Zedong Thought school!

Respected Chairman Mao, you wave your giant hand to us, hoping that we will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We, the proletarian revolutionaries from the direct organs of the six military branches, academies, and the Higher Military Academy and Political Academy, and all the representatives of workers and families, promise you: Respected Chairman Mao, we will definitely study hard, implement resolutely, propagate enthusiastically, and defend bravely your brilliant thoughts and series of latest instructions. We will definitely respond to your great call, hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry forward the good learning style of the revolution, implement your latest instructions item by item, layer by layer, and comprehensively.

Respected Chairman Mao, you wave your giant hand to us, hoping that we will complete the "Three Supports, Two Militant" tasks perfectly. We, the representatives of the "Three Supports, Two Militant" tasks, promise you: Respected Chairman Mao, we will definitely study your theory, line, policy, method, and policy of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and help the revolutionary masses fully implement your latest instructions, raising the "Three Supports, Two Militant" work to a new level.

Respected Chairman Mao, you wave your giant hand to us, hoping that we will better "grasp the revolution, promote production, work, and prepare for war." We, the representatives of the units and factories responsible for production, construction, and war preparedness, promise you: Respected Chairman Mao, we will definitely arm the minds of all soldiers and officers with your great thoughts, complete the production and construction tasks perfectly, and do a good job of war preparedness. The imperialists and their running dogs dare to touch a single hair of ours, your loyal soldiers will smash them to pieces!

Respected Chairman Mao walks vigorously, and with his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, and other central leaders, he walks out of the reception hall. Chairman Mao turns around and waves his giant hand again. At this moment, the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" from the entire audience are like a mountain echoing and a sea roaring, wave after wave. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your brilliant image will forever and forever be engraved in our hearts, and your giant hand will forever and forever guide us to charge forward bravely!

The representatives, with tears of joy and surging red hearts, rush to the telegraph building and to the telephone, spreading the greatest happiness, the greatest glory, and the greatest expectations that Chairman Mao has given us to the entire army and the entire country as quickly as possible!

The long-distance switchboard of a certain communications unit immediately transmits this greatest news to Shenyang, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Kunming, Lanzhou, Lhasa, the border and coastal defense front lines, and all parts of the country. The entire army is boiling, and the entire country is boiling.

The vast revolutionary army, composed of hundreds of millions of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, is advancing with the momentum of moving mountains and the force of thunder, rolling forward, advancing forward, and forever charging forward bravely!
