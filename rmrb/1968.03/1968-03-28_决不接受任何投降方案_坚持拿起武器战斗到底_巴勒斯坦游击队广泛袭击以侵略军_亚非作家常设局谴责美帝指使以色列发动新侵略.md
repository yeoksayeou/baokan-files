	Palestinian Guerrillas Widely Attack Israeli Aggressor Forces
	The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Condemns U.S. Imperialism for Directing Israel to Launch New Aggression

	According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Damascus, a responsible person from the Palestinian underground nationalist organization "Fatah" said on the evening of the 22nd in Damascus to a Xinhua News Agency reporter: During the period of the new aggression by the U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, against Jordan, the "Storm" commando unit of this organization launched attacks on the enemy's rear in the West Bank of the Jordan River, tying down the enemy's actions and accelerating the collapse of the Israeli aggressor forces.

	He said, the "Storm" commando unit had long been monitoring the enemy's actions and anticipated that Israeli Defense Minister Dayan would command the new aggression, so they were fully prepared for battle. At one o'clock in the morning on the 20th, an Israeli military convoy passed between Tel Aviv and Yazur (a suburb of Tel Aviv), and the "Storm" commando unit immediately launched an attack, destroying three enemy vehicles. Israeli Defense Minister Dayan was seriously injured in the car.

	This responsible person also said that on the night before the Israeli army launched its attack on Jordan on the 21st, the mortar unit of the "Storm" commando unit bombarded Israeli positions on the West Bank of the Jordan River for eight hours, causing heavy casualties among the enemy.

	He said, Israel's new aggression is part of the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Zionism. On the one hand, they are exerting pressure on Arab countries to force them to accept the so-called "political solution" plan, allowing the United Nations to protect Israel's occupation; on the other hand, they are trying to stop the increasingly strong activities of the Palestinian guerrillas in the occupied Arab territories by massacring the Palestinian people.

	He said: As Chairman Mao pointed out, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Israel's new aggression does not indicate the strength of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israel, but rather indicates their weakness.

	He emphasized that we will never accept the so-called "political solution" and any surrender plan. We will not yield to military pressure and other pressures. On the road of armed struggle, we will not waver. We will definitely persist in the just struggle until we smash the imperialist and Zionist aggression conspiracy and liberate all Arab lands occupied by Israel.

	According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency on the 27th, the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau issued a statement today, strongly condemning the new aggression crime of the U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, launching a large-scale surprise attack on Jordan. The statement pointed out that this is a blatant provocation to the peoples and governments of the Arab countries and to all the people of the world who love freedom and justice.

	The statement said, the Arab people cannot put any hope in the "wisdom" of imperialism led by the United States, cannot put hope in the renegade leaders of the infamous Soviet revisionism, and cannot put hope in the market of the United Nations, which is a tool of imperialism. The great leader of the world's revolution, Chairman Mao Zedong, correctly pointed out: "The oppressed peoples and nations can never rely on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys for their liberation, but only through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle can they achieve victory." The statement hopes that the Palestinian and Arab peoples will thoroughly expose the crimes of imperialism led by the United States and its number one accomplice, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, and hopes to fight Israel head-on until final victory is achieved.

	The statement calls on all revolutionary and progressive writers in Asia and Africa to strongly protest against the shameless aggression of U.S. imperialism and Israel, expose the despicable betrayal of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, and encourage the struggle of the Arab people.

    决不接受任何投降方案　坚持拿起武器战斗到底
    巴勒斯坦游击队广泛袭击以侵略军
    亚非作家常设局谴责美帝指使以色列发动新侵略
    据新华社大马士革电　巴勒斯坦地下民族主义组织“法塔赫”的一位负责人二十二日晚上在大马士革对新华社记者说：在美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列对约旦进行新的侵略期间，这个组织的“暴风”突击队对约旦河西岸敌军后方发动袭击，牵制了敌军行动，加速了以色列侵略军的溃败。
    他说，“暴风”突击队早已监视着敌军行动，预料以色列国防部长达扬将指挥新的侵略行动，因而他们作好了战斗准备。二十日清晨一时，一个以色列军用车队经过特拉维夫和雅祖尔（特拉维夫市郊区）之间的公路，“暴风”突击队当即发动攻击，击毁敌人三辆汽车，以色列国防部长达扬在车中受重伤。
    这位负责人还说，在二十一日以军发动对约旦进攻的前夜，“暴风”突击队的迫击炮部队轰击约旦河西岸的以色列阵地达八小时，使敌军遭到重大死伤。
    这位负责人说，以色列这次新的侵略行动，是美帝国主义和以色列犹太复国主义阴谋的一部分，他们一方面对阿拉伯国家施加压力，企图迫使阿拉伯国家接受所谓“政治解决”计划，让联合国来保护以色列的占领；另一方面企图通过屠杀巴勒斯坦人民，来制止巴勒斯坦游击队在被占领的阿拉伯领土上的日益加强的活动。
    他说：正如毛主席指出的，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。以色列新的侵略并不表明美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的强大，而是表明他们的虚弱。
    他强调说，我们决不接受所谓“政治解决”和任何投降方案，我们决不向军事压力和其他压力屈服，在武装斗争的道路上，我们决不动摇，我们一定要坚持正义斗争，直到粉碎帝国主义和犹太复国主义的侵略阴谋，解放一切被以色列占领的阿拉伯土地。
    据新华社二十七日讯亚非作家常设局今天发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列向约旦发动大规模突然袭击的新的侵略罪行。声明指出，这是对阿拉伯各国人民和政府以及全世界爱好自由和正义的人民的公然挑衅。
    声明说，阿拉伯人民决不能把任何希望寄托在以美国为首的帝国主义的“明智”上，决不能寄托在帝国主义的帮凶、臭名远扬的苏联修正主义领导人身上，决不能寄托在他们做买卖的市场联合国上。全世界的革命领袖毛泽东主席正确地指出：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”声明希望巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民起来彻底揭露以美国为首的帝国主义及其头号帮凶——苏修领导集团的罪行，并且希望对以色列进行针锋相对的斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    声明号召所有亚非革命的进步作家强烈抗议美帝国主义和以色列的无耻的侵略，揭露苏修统治集团卑劣的叛卖行为，鼓励阿拉伯人民的斗争。
