In the brilliant "March 7th Directive," Chairman Mao once again points out to us: "We must carry out Marx's teaching that 'the proletariat can only liberate itself by liberating all mankind.'" Chairman Mao's great call embodies the broad-mindedness of the proletariat, which can encompass the entire world, and the magnificent spirit of taking "liberating all mankind" as our mission.

Whether or not we faithfully carry out Chairman Mao's "March 7th Directive" is, just like whether or not we resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, a matter of attitude towards our great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

To be loyal to the "March 7th Directive," we must correctly handle comrades who have made mistakes. If their mistakes are not of an antagonistic nature, we must patiently persuade them to correct their errors and warmly help them to do so. As long as they sincerely correct their mistakes, we should welcome them enthusiastically and not keep criticizing them endlessly, let alone "exaggerate their mistakes indefinitely."

To be loyal to the "March 7th Directive," we must correctly handle cadres who have made mistakes. As long as they are not traitors, spies, or incorrigible capitalist roaders, we must have the courage to allow them to have made mistakes in the past and to correct them now. We must also allow them to make mistakes again after being liberated and united, and continue to help them correct their mistakes. We must provide conditions for cadres who have made mistakes to achieve new merits, so that they can boldly take up their work.

To be loyal to the "March 7th Directive," revolutionary youngsters in schools must also correctly handle revolutionary teachers, encouraging them to play an active role in the educational revolution. For those whose family backgrounds are not good but who themselves have no problems, or who have some general historical issues but have been cleared, as well as teachers who have made mistakes, we should not exclude them but let them continue to work for their reform.

It is worth noting that up to now, some comrades are still implementing a policy of "isolating oneself." In dealing with comrades, they always "hold onto their mistakes and exaggerate them indefinitely," or they are incompatible and cannot eliminate their antagonistic sentiments. In dealing with cadres, they always do not distinguish between major and minor issues, "liberating those who follow me and overthrowing those who oppose me," or they are not satisfied and do not dare to unite with them.

Those who cannot correctly handle others will also not be able to correctly handle themselves. Comrades who implement the policy of "isolating oneself" always think they are right, as if the truth is in their hands; they always think only they are capable, and others are not, as if the world would not turn without them. Is there really such a thing in the world? Can you, a few people, really smash the old world?

### 确立解放全人类的伟大气魄

　　确立解放全人类的伟大气魄
    在光辉的“三·七”指示中，毛主席再一次向我们指出：要“实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导”。毛主席这个伟大的号召，体现了无产阶级装得下整个世界的宽广胸怀，以“解放全人类”为己任的宏伟气魄。
    是不是忠实执行毛主席的“三·七”指示，同是不是坚决贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示一样，这是对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想的态度问题。
    忠于“三·七”指示，就要正确对待犯过错误的战友。如果他的错误，还不是敌我矛盾的性质，就要耐心地劝说他们改正，热情地帮助他们改正。只要人家认真改正了，就应当热烈欢迎，不要老是批评个没完，更不要“无限上纲”。
    忠于“三·七”指示，就要正确对待犯过错误的干部。只要他不是叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，我们就要有这样的气魄，不但允许他们过去犯错误，现在改正错误，而且还允许他们在解放、结合以后再犯错误，并继续帮助他们改正错误。我们要为犯过错误的干部提供立新功的条件，使他们能够大胆地把工作抓起来。
    忠于“三·七”指示，学校中的革命小将还要正确对待革命的教员，鼓励他们在教育革命中发挥积极的作用。对于那些家庭出身不好、但本人没有什么问题的，或有一般历史问题、但已查清楚的，以及犯过错误的教员，也不要排斥他们，要让他们继续工作，以利改造。
    值得注意的是，直到现在，有些同志还在实行“孤家寡人”的政策。对待战友，老是“揪住辫子，无限上纲”，或者格格不入，对立情绪怎么也消除不了。对待干部，老是不分大节和小节，“顺我者解放，逆我者打倒”，或者不称心不放心，怎么也不肯结合。
    不能正确地对待别人，也就不能正确地对待自己。实行“孤家寡人”政策的同志，总是以为自己对，好象真理都在自己手里；总是认为只有自己才行，别人什么都不行，好象世界上没有自己，地球就不转了。难道天下真有这样的事情吗？难道光靠你们这少数人，能把旧世界砸烂吗？
