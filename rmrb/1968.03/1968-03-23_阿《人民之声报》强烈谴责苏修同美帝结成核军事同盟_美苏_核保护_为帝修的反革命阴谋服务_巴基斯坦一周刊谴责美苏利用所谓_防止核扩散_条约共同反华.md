The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial on March 21 strongly condemning the intensified collusion between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism on nuclear issues, pointing out that this collusion serves the hegemonic policies of the two superpowers to dominate the world.

The article states: Recently, imperialism and revisionism have been using their propaganda machines to hype up the draft treaty on "preventing nuclear proliferation" and the "nuclear umbrella" agreement jointly concocted by the Soviet Union and the United States. This is a propaganda ploy to deceive the peoples of various countries. The conspiracies jointly hatched by Washington and Moscow are based on the "holy alliance" of the two superpowers to dominate the world, aiming to serve the counter-revolutionary plots of the United States and the Soviet Union.

The article states: The "nuclear protection" conspiracy fabricated by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism actually harbors the cunning and evil intention to enslave the peoples of other countries. The conspiracy of "preventing nuclear proliferation" strips the sovereign countries of their right to strengthen their own defensive capabilities, placing these countries under the "protection" and "benevolence" of the two "superpowers."

The article states: However, the draft treaty on "preventing nuclear proliferation" imposes no restrictions on the increasingly extensive nuclear arms race between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. In fact, these two "superpowers," based on their hegemonic policies to dominate the world, are increasing their atomic weapons, continuing nuclear blackmail, and jointly plotting various conspiracies to oppose revolutionary forces.

The article states: The main target of these conspiracies by the United States and the Soviet Union is the great people of China. China is the iron bastion of the world revolution and an insurmountable obstacle to the U.S. and Soviet plans to enslave the peoples of the world.

The article points out: The Chinese people's possession of nuclear weapons has broken the nuclear monopoly of the two "superpowers." This is the reason why all revolutionary and anti-imperialist forces rejoice in the Chinese people's possession of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and missiles.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Lahore, March 21: The weekly "Rock" published in Layyah, West Pakistan, recently criticized the draft treaty on "preventing nuclear proliferation" and the agreement to provide a "nuclear umbrella" to the Indian reactionaries jointly concocted by the United States and the Soviet Union. The article states: The current rulers of the Soviet Union have gone beyond the so-called boundary of peaceful coexistence with imperialism and have become supporters of imperialism.

The article points out that these conspiratorial activities jointly carried out by the United States and the Soviet Union are directed against socialist China, which they oppose, and are intended to incite the Indian reactionaries to provoke China at any time.

    新华社地拉那二十二日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十一日发表编辑部文章，强烈谴责美帝苏修在核问题上加紧勾结，指出这种勾结是为两大国主宰世界霸权政策效劳的。
    文章说：帝国主义和修正主义最近开动宣传机器，大肆吹捧苏美合伙炮制的“防止核扩散”条约草案和“核保护伞”协议。这是它们为了欺骗各国人民而进行的宣传。华盛顿和莫斯科之间共同炮制的这些阴谋，是建立在苏美两大国主宰世界的“神圣同盟”的基础上的，其目的是为美苏两大国的反革命阴谋服务。
    文章说：美帝和苏修制造的“核保护”阴谋，实际上是包藏了企图奴役其它国家人民的狡猾的和罪恶的祸心。而“防止核扩散”的阴谋则剥夺了各主权国家加强自己防御能力的权利，使这些国家置身于这两个“超级大国”的“保护”和“施舍”之下。
    文章说：但是，“防止核扩散”条约草案对美帝和苏修愈益广泛地进行核军备竞赛，却不加任何限制。事实上，这两个
  “超级大国”根据它们主宰世界的霸权政策，正在增加原子武器，继续进行核讹诈，共同策划各种阴谋来反对革命力量。
    文章说：美苏这些阴谋的主要矛头是针对伟大的中国人民的。中国是世界革命的钢铁堡垒，是美苏推行奴役世界人民计划的不可逾越的障碍。
    文章指出：中国人民掌握核武器，打破了美苏两个“超级大国”的核垄断。这就是一切革命的和反帝的力量，为中国人民掌握原子武器、氢弹和导弹而欢欣鼓舞的原因所在。
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第二十一日电　西巴基斯坦莱雅普尔出版的《顽石》周刊最近一期发表文章，谴责美苏炮制的“防止核扩散”条约草案和共同向印度反动派等提供“核保护伞”的协议。文章说：苏联当前的统治者已经越过了所谓同帝国主义和平共处的界限，而且已经成为帝国主义的支持者。
    文章指出，苏美合伙搞的这些阴谋活动，是针对它们所敌视的社会主义中国的，并且是为了唆使印度反动派随时对中国进行挑衅活动。
