The capital's revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing warmly welcomed the heroes of the Vietnamese South, the delegation of Vietnamese South Youth and Anti-American Warriors, who arrived in Beijing amidst the joyous cheers for the Vietnamese South's New Year victories. The revolutionary masses expressed that the Chinese people will definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the anti-American, national salvation war to the final victory.

The delegation, led by Vuong Quoc Trung, Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese South Youth Liberation Union, was invited by the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association to participate in the celebrations of the national anti-American day in Vietnam and to conduct a friendly visit to China. The delegation members include the anti-American warriors Vuong Truong Kien, Phan Van Song, the member of the Women's Liberation Union of Quang Tri Province, Le Thi An, and Nguyen Thi Hau, among others.

Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, relevant responsible persons Han Nianlong, Wang Xinting, Ding Xilin, Mao Zedong's good soldier Nian Siyang, combat hero Shu Jicheng, air force combat hero Han Yongwu, responsible members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and over 2,000 revolutionary masses from the capital welcomed the heroic Vietnamese South comrades at the airport.

The permanent representative of the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front in China, Nguyen Van Quang, the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Ambassador to China, Vu Minh Loan, and other Vietnamese comrades in Beijing also went to the airport to welcome them.

Today, the capital airport flew high the national flags of China and the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front. The comrades of the Vietnamese South Youth and Anti-American Warriors delegation, amidst the enthusiastic cheers of "Salute to the heroic Vietnamese people," stepped off the plane. Li Fuchun and Chen Yi, along with others, went forward to shake hands with Vuong Quoc Trung and the delegation members, welcoming them to join the Chinese people in celebrating the glorious fighting days of the Vietnamese people.

Red Guards representatives from the capital pinned Mao Zedong badges on the chests of the Vietnamese South comrades and presented them with the red revolutionary book "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

The Red Guards representatives read aloud the quotations from Chairman Mao: "You are fighting well! Under extremely difficult conditions, you have relied on your own strength to defeat the most ferocious American imperialists, making them desperate and disorganized. This is a great victory. The Chinese people salute you."

They also read aloud the quotations from President Ho Chi Minh: "In the early days of spring, our southern military and people fought well, launching widespread attacks and achieving great victories everywhere! The American aggressors and their lackeys have been struck by thunderous blows and are extremely panicked and disorganized; the puppet government and puppet army are being dissolved in large numbers. The whole nation is excited and proud of this; our friends from the five continents are very happy!"

Accompanied by Li Fuchun and Chen Yi, Vuong Quoc Trung and other Vietnamese comrades walked around the airport to greet the welcoming revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses of the capital, who are closely following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, and are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, expressed their most enthusiastic revolutionary sentiments and firm support to the heroic Vietnamese comrades. People held high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, the portraits of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh, and the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front, Nguyen Huu Tho, the national flags of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front, waving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live President Ho Chi Minh! Long live the victory of the people's war! Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Resolutely support the great anti-American, national salvation war of the Vietnamese people! Long live the brotherly friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam! Seven hundred million Chinese people are determined to be the strong rear support for the Vietnamese people! Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet modern revisionism! Resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world!"

The Vietnamese South comrades left the airport, and the slogans "The heroic Vietnamese people will surely win! The American imperialists will surely be defeated!" still echoed in the airport.

On the evening of the 18th, Li Fuchun, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, held a banquet to warmly welcome the delegation of Vietnamese South Youth and Anti-American Warriors led by Vuong Quoc Trung.

At the banquet filled with revolutionary and fighting friendship, Li Fuchun and Vuong Quoc Trung made speeches. Li Fuchun highly praised the New Year victories of the Vietnamese South military and people as a creative development of people's war, pointing out that the victories of the Vietnamese people have inspired all revolutionary peoples and greatly dampened the spirits of American imperialism and its lackeys. He said that we will always follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, regard supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation war as our internationalist duty.

Vuong Quoc Trung said in his speech that we express our deepest and most sincere gratitude to the great and sincere assistance provided by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people led by the respected Chairman Mao to the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese South military and people are determined to press on with victories, continue to fight, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and traitorous lackeys.

The comrades of China and Vietnam frequently raised their glasses, toasting to the long life of Chairman Mao! To the long life of President Ho Chi Minh! To the health of Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho! To the health of Vice Chairman Lin Biao!

The permanent representative of the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front in China, Nguyen Van Quang, and the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Ambassador to China, Vu Minh Loan, were invited to attend the banquet.

In his speech, Li Fuchun, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, expressed the warmest welcome to the Vietnamese South comrades who came from the battlefield to the rear. He said, you are the heroes of the anti-American struggle, and you have established many merits in the anti-American, national salvation war. We salute you and, through you, salute all the Vietnamese South military and people, and salute the heroic Vietnamese people.

Li Fuchun said, the heroic Vietnamese South military and people have achieved extremely brilliant victories in the struggle against American imperialism over the past few years. Especially this year's New Year victories, which have made American imperialism suffer greatly, are worthy of our great praise and are remarkable victories. Now, the Vietnamese South is facing an unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation. We extend our warmest congratulations to the Vietnamese comrades.

Li Fuchun pointed out that the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese South people are the great victories of people's war. This powerful New Year offensive, combining urban and rural areas, military and civilians, and internal and external forces, is a creative development of people's war. The victories achieved by all the Vietnamese people have shocked the world, inspired all revolutionary peoples, and greatly dampened the spirits of American imperialism and its lackeys. As our great leader Chairman Mao said in his telegram to Nguyen Huu Tho, "Your victories once again show that no matter how large or small a country is, as long as it fully mobilizes the people and relies on the people to fight a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated. The anti-American, national salvation war led by the great leader Ho Chi Minh has set a brilliant example for the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world to achieve liberation."

He said, the days of the American aggressors in Vietnam are getting worse. They have shown signs of impending doom. However, American imperialism is still unwilling to admit defeat. They are sending more troops to South Vietnam, threatening to invade Laos, and intensifying their bombing of North Vietnam. American imperialism is also colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership to plot various peace talks. President Ho Chi Minh of the Vietnamese people pointed out in his telegram to Nguyen Huu Tho, "The closer we get to victory, the more difficulties we will face. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will struggle more desperately. Therefore, our military and people must strengthen their unity and continue to fight, strike hard, and strike continuously to achieve greater victories." We are confident that under the correct leadership of the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front and the guidance of the program of the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front, the Vietnamese South people will definitely overcome the difficulties on the road to victory and achieve the final victory in the anti-American, national salvation war.

Li Fuchun finally said, the Chinese people will be greatly inspired by your heroic deeds. During the delegation's visit to our country, you will also see the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the profound significance of this great revolution. We wish the delegation a successful visit.

Vuong Quoc Trung said in his speech that we were dispatched by the Central Committee of the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front to come to the vast and strong rear of our Vietnamese people. We convey the most cordial and fighting unity to the brothers and sisters of the Chinese people who are fighting on the frontline against the American aggressors and their lackeys and are achieving victories.

He said, we express our deepest gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party and the brotherly Chinese people led by the respected Chairman Mao for their great, sincere, and effective assistance to our military and people in the anti-American, national salvation struggle.

Vuong Quoc Trung said, last winter and this spring, our military and people carried out the orders of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front, achieving great and comprehensive victories in both military and political aspects, laying a solid foundation for the final victory. Our series of attacks launched simultaneously in the New Year and the widespread uprisings in various places are the initial victories of the current long-term anti-American, national salvation struggle entering a new stage. We are determined to press on with victories, continue to fight, and continue to give the American aggressors and traitorous lackeys heavier blows, making them suffer a thorough defeat.

He said, our extremely great victories are the victories of the political program of the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front, which shines with the light of justice, the victories of our military and people's unity, perseverance, and brave fighting. At the same time, it is inseparable from the wholehearted support of our 17 million compatriots in the North and the great and effective assistance of the brotherly 700 million Chinese people who are willing to make any great sacrifices. The Vietnamese South people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front, are determined to fight tenaciously, thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and traitorous lackeys, liberate the South, defend the North, and eventually achieve the peaceful reunification of the Vietnamese motherland.

Attending the banquet were also representatives of the PLA's active learners of Chairman Mao's works and combat heroes, representatives of the revolutionary masses of the capital, and responsible persons from relevant departments, including Han Nianlong, Wang Xinting, Ding Xilin, and others.

    新华社十八日讯　中共中央政治局常委李富春和国务院副总理陈毅今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎由武公中率领的越南南方青年和歼美勇士代表团。
    在充满革命战斗友谊气氛的宴会上，李富春同志和武公中团长先后讲了话。李富春同志热烈赞扬越南南方军民新春大捷是人民战争的创造性的发展，指出越南人民取得的胜利，鼓舞了一切革命的人民，大灭了美帝国主义及其走狗的威风。他说，我们永远遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把支援越南人民的抗美救国战争看成是自己的国际主义义务。

    李富春同志说，英雄的越南南方军民几年来在抗击美帝国主义的斗争中，取得了极其辉煌的胜利。特别是今年的新春大捷，把美帝国主义打得焦头烂额，是值得我们大大称颂的了不起的胜利。现在，越南南方出现了一片空前大好的革命形势。我们向越南同志表示最热烈的祝贺。
    李富春同志指出，越南南方人民所取得的伟大胜利，是人民战争的伟大胜利。这次强大的新春攻势，城乡结合、军民结合、内外结合，是人民战争的创造性的发展。全体越南人民所取得的胜利，震惊了世界，鼓舞了一切革命的人民，大灭了美帝国主义及其走狗的威风。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席给阮友寿主席的贺电中所说的：“你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。越南人民在伟大领袖胡志明主席的英明领导下进行的抗美救国战争，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，树立了一个光辉的榜样。”

    李富春同志最后说，中国人民将从你们的英雄事迹中，受到巨大的鼓舞。代表团在我国访问期间，还会看到我国无产阶级文化大革命所获得的伟大成果，以及这场大革命的深远意义。我们预祝代表团访问成功。
    武公中团长在讲话中说，我们受越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的委派，来到我们越南人民辽阔和坚强的后方。我们向兄弟的中国人民转达战斗在抗击美国侵略者及其走狗的前线并正在取得胜利的越南南方军民的最亲切的团结战斗的敬意。
    他说，我们对以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党、兄弟的中国人民在我们军民进行的抗美救国斗争中所给予我们的巨大的、真诚的和非常有效的援助，表示我们越南南方人民、人民解放武装力量和越南南方青年解放联合会的深切的感谢。
    武公中团长说，去冬今春，我们军民执行了越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团的命令，在军事上和政治上取得了巨大和全面的胜利，为夺取最后的胜利打下了牢固的基础。我们在新春同时发动的一系列的进攻以及各地的广泛的起义，是当前我们长期的抗美救国斗争进入了一个新的阶段所取得的初步的胜利，我们决心乘胜前进，再接再厉，继续给予美国侵略者及卖国走狗以更沉重的打击，使它们遭到彻底的失败。
    他说，我们取得的极其巨大的胜利，是越南南方民族解放阵线闪耀着正义光辉的政治纲领的路线的胜利，是我们军民团结一致、坚韧不拔、英勇战斗的胜利。同时，它与我们北方一千七百万骨肉同胞的全心全意的援助是分不开的，与兄弟的七亿中国人民不惜任何巨大牺牲，所给予我们的巨大而有效的援助是分不开的。越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，决心顽强坚持战斗，彻底打败美国侵略强盗及卖国走狗，解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一越南祖国。
