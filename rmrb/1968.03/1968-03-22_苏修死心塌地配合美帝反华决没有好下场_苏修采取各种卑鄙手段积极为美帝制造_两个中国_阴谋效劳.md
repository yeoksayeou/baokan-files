Recently, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has been even more despicable and shameless in adopting various means to actively collaborate with U.S. imperialism in its evil plot to create "two Chinas."

On February 5, 1968, the sixth issue of the Soviet Bookstore's *New Soviet Books* catalog, under the guise of promoting the Olympic Games, shamelessly published the so-called "national emblem" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit clique on the inside cover. The Soviet revisionists also provocatively sent batches of this *New Soviet Books* catalog to relevant Chinese parties. This is yet another piece of evidence of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's anti-China conspiracy activities.

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique's activities in following the U.S. imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas" are not new. In 1965, the Soviet "Komsomol" Press published a picture album titled *For the People of the World*, which included a photograph of the Olympic Games featuring the so-called "national flag" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit clique. At that time, the Soviet revisionists also shamelessly sent this picture album to the Chinese side, brazenly provoking the 700 million people of China politically.

In recent years, especially since the great proletarian cultural revolution that has shaken the world began in China, representatives of the Soviet revisionist clique have openly sat on the same bench with "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit clique in various international conferences. For example, the Soviet revisionists, together with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit clique, have participated in more than ten conferences organized by United Nations agencies in the Southeast Asian region. These include the Asian Development Bank planning conference, the Asian Children and Youth Work Conference, the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East conference, the Asian Radio and Television Education Conference, the World Buddhist Fellowship Conference, the 13th Session of the Asian Consultative Committee, and the Asian International Exposition, among others.

At the same time, Soviet revisionist publications have deliberately propagated that Taiwan Province is a "state." The Soviet *Abroad* magazine published two articles in its 21st and 37th issues of 1966, both of which separated Taiwan from China and treated it as a "state." On July 28, 1967, TASS openly referred to Taiwan as a "state" in its report. On July 6, 1966, *Pravda* even shamelessly referred to Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the Chinese people, as the "Nationalist Party President." Recently, the Soviet revisionists have been even more zealously promoting the fallacy of "two Chinas." On February 13 of this year, *Pravda* even used the words of U.S. imperialists to propagate that "Taipei and Beijing should both become members of the United Nations."

Despite the fact that the Chinese government has repeatedly protested to the Soviet authorities, the Soviet revisionists' active collaboration with U.S. imperialism in its evil plot to create "two Chinas" has not only shown no sign of abatement but has instead become even more despicable, blatant, and arrogant.

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Those who are wholeheartedly led by U.S. imperialism to walk the path of slavery will ultimately meet their doom at the hands of U.S. imperialism." Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit clique, which has been occupying Taiwan, has long been despised by the 700 million people of China. The Soviet revisionists' wholehearted service to U.S. imperialism in its evil plot to create "two Chinas" will certainly meet a bad end.

    苏修死心塌地配合美帝反华决没有好下场
    苏修采取各种卑鄙手段积极为美帝制造“两个中国”阴谋效劳
    新华社二十一日讯 最近一个时期以来，苏修叛徒集团更加卑鄙无耻地采取种种手段，积极配合美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的罪恶阴谋。
    一九六八年二月五日出版的苏联国际书店《苏联新书》目录第六期，竟在封面内页借宣传奥林匹克运动会的照片，无耻地刊登蒋匪帮的所谓“国徽”。苏修方面还挑衅性地成批地把这本《苏联新书》目录寄给了中国有关方面。这是苏修叛徒集团反华阴谋活动的又一个新罪证。
    苏修叛徒集团追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动，绝非今日始。一九六五年由苏联“青年近卫军”出版社出版的题为《为了世界上的人们》的画册中，就刊登过一幅有蒋匪帮的所谓“国旗”的奥林匹克运动会的照片。当时，苏修方面也无耻地把这个画册送给了中国方面，明目张胆地向七亿中国人民进行政治挑衅。
    近几年来，特别是在震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命开展以后，苏修集团的代表就公开同蒋匪帮的“代表”坐在一条板凳上开什么国际会议，其中苏修同蒋匪帮一起参加由联合国机构在东南亚地区举行的会议，就有十多次。诸如什么亚洲开发银行计划会议、亚洲儿童和青年工作会议、联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会会议、亚洲无线电和电视教育会议、世界佛教徒联谊会会议、亚洲谘询委员会第十三届代表大会、亚洲国际博览会等等。
    与此同时，苏修报刊蓄意宣传中国的台湾省是一个“国家”。苏修《在国外》杂志一九六六年第二十一、三十七期分别刊登两篇文章，均把台湾同中国割裂开来当作“国家”。一九六七年七月二十八日塔斯社在报道中公然又把台湾称作“国家”。《真理报》一九六六年七月六日还无耻地把中国人民公敌蒋介石叫作“国民党总统”。最近苏修更加卖力鼓吹“两个中国”的谬论。今年二月十三日《真理报》竟借美帝国主义分子之口，宣传什么“台湾和北京都应成为联合国成员”。
    尽管中国政府曾多次向苏联当局提出抗议，但苏修积极配合美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的罪恶活动，不仅毫无收敛，反而变本加厉，更加卑鄙、露骨和嚣张。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”台湾是中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，盘踞在台湾的蒋匪帮是早已被七亿中国人民所唾弃的卖国贼。苏修死心塌地为美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的罪恶阴谋效劳，是决没有好下场的。
