The capital holds a grand rally to support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle.

A Xinhua News Agency report dated March 19th: March 19th is the Vietnam National Anti-American Day. Today, the capital's people held a grand rally to support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle, enthusiastically acclaiming the Vietnamese people's full utilization of the invincible power of people's war, defeating the most ferocious American imperialism in the world, making it suffer a humiliating defeat.

The rally solemnly declared: The peoples of China and Vietnam are close comrades and brothers. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: "The 700 million Chinese people are the strong backing of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." The Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war until final victory is achieved.

The grand rally was held in the Great Hall of the People. At the center of the stage hung the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Vietnamese people Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and the Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho. Facing the stage hung a banner with Chairman Mao's words: "Victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people!" and another banner reading: "The 700 million Chinese people swear to be the strong backing of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war!"

Before the rally began, more than ten thousand People's Liberation Army soldiers from the land, sea, and air forces, revolutionary masses from the capital, and Red Guards, read aloud Chairman Mao's words: "Your victory once again shows that regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

They also read aloud Chairman Ho Chi Minh's words: "Justice is on our side. All our compatriots and soldiers nationwide are united as one, brave and intelligent, and will decisively win the decisive battle. We will surely achieve a complete victory!"

The Acting Mayor of Beijing, Comrade Xie Fuzhi, announced the beginning of the rally. Everyone stood up, and the orchestra played the songs "Liberate the South" of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the national anthem of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.

Comrade Zhou Enlai, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, spoke at the rally. He enthusiastically praised the new victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war.

Following this, the leader of the delegation of Vietnamese youth and anti-American heroes from South Vietnam spoke, saying that the military and people of South Vietnam are determined to advance victoriously, fearing neither sacrifice nor hardship, and will resolutely and tenaciously launch continuous attacks on the enemy, definitely carrying out the anti-American national salvation cause to complete victory, liberating the South, defending the North, and eventually achieving the peaceful reunification of the Vietnamese motherland.

After the leader of the South Vietnamese delegation spoke, along with other members of the delegation, they presented a banner to the people of the capital in a storm of applause. The banner read: "United as one, decisive battle, decisive victory, thoroughly defeat the American imperialist invaders!"

The Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China also spoke.

Representatives of the PLA garrison in Beijing and representatives of various revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing also spoke at the rally. They expressed their determination to learn from the Vietnamese comrades' spirit of despising the enemy, fighting bravely, fearing neither sacrifice nor hardship, and advancing fearlessly. They vowed to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, decisively win the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and contribute all their strength to support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war and to support the world revolution.

All the speeches at the rally were met with enthusiastic applause from the audience.

"Resolutely support the great anti-American national salvation war of the Vietnamese people!" "The 700 million Chinese people swear to be the strong backing of the Vietnamese people!" "Long live the brotherly friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam!" "Long live the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" "Salute to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam led by Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho!" "The Vietnamese people will win, American imperialism will be defeated!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world!" "Long live people's war!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"
