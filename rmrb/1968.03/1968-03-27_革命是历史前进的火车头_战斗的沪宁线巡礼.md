Revolution is the locomotive of history's progress – A tour of the battle-ready Shanghai-Nanjing Railway

Revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of history's progress.

The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, tempered by the baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is now more vibrant than ever. On the 600-mile winding tracks, trains shuttle back and forth, "red flags fluttering like paintings," the revolutionary spring is endless, and the production wave surges higher and higher. Along the railway, revolutionary workers, facing the surging waves of class struggle, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Together with the soldiers and officers of the 6410th Unit executing the task of supporting the left and protecting the railway, they advance shoulder to shoulder on the revolutionary tracks of Mao Zedong Thought.

The excellent situation on the Shanghai-Nanjing line is a great victory won by the heroic military and civilian population along the line in their struggle against the class enemy. It is not easy to block the train with one's arm.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, a thrilling class struggle unfolded on the Shanghai-Nanjing line. Just as the broad masses of railway workers were angrily denouncing the crimes of China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders in the old Ministry of Railways who attempted to restore capitalism on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, and just as the struggle between the two lines in the Suzhou area was at its peak, some reactionary creatures hiding in the shadows emerged, waving the banner of "rebellion," fiercely protecting a handful of capitalist roaders, and launching a savage attack on the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and the broad revolutionary masses. The counter-revolutionary clique of Li Shunzhi and Qi Zhen, directly manipulated by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, once gathered arrogantly along the Shanghai-Nanjing line, issuing cries of "daring to take risks and solve problems through armed struggle," and "the more the two factions fight, the happier I am." They stretched their evil hands into the cities and countryside along the Shanghai-Nanjing line, creating divisions among the masses and inciting armed struggles.

Just at this critical moment in the class struggle, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected the North China, Central South, and East China regions, issuing a series of extremely important instructions. At this time, the 6410th Unit, tasked with supporting the left, adhered to the principle of "supporting the left but not factions" and shared the heavy responsibility of protecting the railway with the revolutionary masses. When the class enemy incited serious confrontations between the two revolutionary mass organizations, the soldiers and officers, disregarding personal safety, patrolled the railway day and night, guarded the signal equipment, and stood side by side with the locomotive drivers to ensure the normal operation of the trains. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, they mobilized overnight, going door to door to convey the spring breeze to all stations and sections along the line, and even to the vast rural areas on both sides of the railway. Chairman Mao's latest instructions armed the broad revolutionary workers, forming a tremendous force. The heroic military and civilian population along the line, remembering the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," firmly grasped the power of the railway in their own hands, aimed their guns and fists at a handful of class enemies, and launched a fierce attack on the evil-doing Li and Qi counter-revolutionary clique.

Once, when the scoundrels of the Li and Qi counter-revolutionary clique, under the guise of "rebellion," ordered all workers of a certain water supply station to leave their posts, attempting to create a water and train stoppage incident, the revolutionary workers of this water supply station, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, immediately saw through the class enemy's evil plot and gave a resolute blow. They said, "We workers only listen to Chairman Mao's orders. Chairman Mao tells us to 'grasp revolution and promote production,' so we will not leave our battle stations by a single step!"

Another time, the Li and Qi counter-revolutionary clique repeatedly instigated armed struggles in a certain place, seriously threatening the safety of train operations along the entire line. At this critical moment, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who were infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and more than twenty revolutionary workers from the Suzhou Signal Section, stepped forward, loudly reading Chairman Mao's quotations:

"Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's instructions, and under the protection of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the railway workers smashed the class enemy's sabotage plot.

It is not easy to block the train with one's arm. Last year, when the Li and Qi counter-revolutionary clique was frantically carrying out sabotage activities along the Shanghai-Nanjing line, they once boasted, blinded by greed and arrogance, "The Beijing-Shanghai line can be said to be entirely in our hands." But the wheel of history will not turn backward according to the whims of a handful of counter-revolutionary clowns. As Chairman Mao's latest instructions were implemented along the Shanghai-Nanjing line, a handful of counter-revolutionary clowns were surrounded by the vast sea of revolutionary masses. Today, on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, one can see everywhere soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary workers enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought; northbound and southbound freight trains are fully loaded with various materials sent to all parts of the country. The revolutionary train is speeding forward on the tracks of Mao Zedong Thought!

Fire surrounds factionalism

In the struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders and the Li and Qi counter-revolutionary clique, the broad revolutionary workers along the Shanghai-Nanjing line deeply felt: bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a big poisonous snake. They said, "The reactionary nature of factionalism lies in its being used by the enemy." With the help of the 6410th Unit, they held large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, deeply studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "there being no fundamental conflict of interests within the working class," "each doing more self-criticism," and "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism." They launched a "people's war" to surround and annihilate factionalism, turning the 600-mile Shanghai-Nanjing Railway into a frontline for fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. The more they studied, the more they felt their class brothers were close, the more they hated a handful of class enemies, the more they hated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and the faster they advanced the steps of revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

The Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works, an old factory with a history of seventy years, had a period when the class enemy's black hands also reached here, inciting serious divisions among the revolutionary mass organizations. Just at this time, the soldiers sent by Chairman Mao, helped the two factions establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the study classes, everyone deeply studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, focused on class education, and cadres and masses, leaders and masses, workers and family members, soldiers and revolutionary comrades, all together recalled bitterness and sweetness, surrounded and annihilated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and cut off the black hands, finally quickly achieving revolutionary great alliance. Revolutionary workers said, "We are the victims of factionalism, and we are also the gravediggers of factionalism." They also held a mass meeting to surround and annihilate factionalism, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance in thought, and promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination. At present, all 61 stations and various line sections along the Shanghai-Nanjing line have fully achieved revolutionary great alliance.

The warm spring breeze brings redness to the entire line. Under the help of the 6410th Unit, the broad revolutionary workers, riding the east wind of revolutionary great alliance, put forward the action slogan of "fighting selfishness with iron fists and surrounding factionalism with fire," and launched an attack on the issue of cadres to achieve the revolutionary three-in-one combination as quickly as possible. In this new revolutionary high tide, the Hengshiguan Station, which was the first to achieve revolutionary great alliance along the line, took the lead again and established a revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership cadre. This station, with few people and a small size, but with great aspirations, resolutely eliminated interference and said proudly, "We do not want factional flags, we want the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought." A single red plum blossom brings spring news, and endless spring tides roll in. Now, a large number of basic-level revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership cadres along the Shanghai-Nanjing line have been born one after another. Good news smiles towards the sun

"Red flags dance in the spring breeze, good news smiles towards the sun." The surging spring tide of revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination greatly accelerated the steps of revolutionary workers along the Shanghai-Nanjing line in responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness," and a wave of learning, helping, and catching up in railway transportation production has risen. The attendance rate of various stations and sections along the line has greatly increased, exceeding the highest level in history. The freight work of various stations along the line has been done to load and unload as soon as they arrive.

In this wave of railway transportation production, the broad revolutionary workers never forget to raise high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. Whether workers or family members, everyone insists on the system of everyone reading the precious book every day. Mao Zedong Thought has dyed the souls of revolutionary railway workers red, and good deeds are constantly emerging on the Shanghai-Nanjing line.

Once, the freight department of Changzhou Station was in the process of shifting between the upper and lower shifts when 78 wagons of materials arrived. Considering that if they unloaded the cars according to the usual procedure, it would inevitably affect the turnover of the wagons and cause material accumulation, they decided to launch a continuous assault. At this time, the workers of the previous shift, who had already taken a bath and changed their clothes, disregarded rest and returned to fight side by side with the workers of the current shift. After a short period of intense unloading, they completed the task ahead of schedule. The Huangdu Station has 12 old workers, with an average age of 45. They are old but red-hearted and full of energy. For four months, regardless of wind or rain, they have not been absent once, and have already worked continuously for more than 1,800 days without errors or accidents, becoming the "red in old age" small team.

The old switchman Yao Hongxi from Zhenjiang Station suffered immense oppression in the old society, but in the new society, he is the master, always remembering Chairman Mao's kindness. During the Cultural Revolution, the supporting-left soldiers and the workers on the station helped him study the "Three Constantly Read Articles." He listened to one sentence, remembered one sentence, and used one sentence. He often said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'serve the people wholeheartedly,' and we must do it word for word, without any discount." On the evening of March 1st, he was on duty at the No. 2 switch room at the west entrance of the Zhenjiang Station tunnel, waiting for the 74th express train from Shanghai to pass through the crossing. Suddenly, he saw a freight train coming from the branch line to the main line. At this moment, the 74th express train was about to arrive, and a serious accident was about to occur. Old Yao, disregarding danger, rushed towards the freight train, waving his arms to signal it to stop. Seeing this, the driver immediately applied the emergency brake. The freight train just stopped at the switch point, and the 74th express train flew past on the main line. A major accident was avoided. Afterwards, comrades were all moved by Old Yao's heroic deed, but Old Yao said, "It's nothing, serving the people, that's all."

The soldiers and officers of the 6410th Unit executing the supporting-left task along the line, in addition to propagating Mao Zedong Thought at all times, also worked together with the revolutionary workers, escorted the train, guarded the railway, sold tickets, checked tickets, connected lines, and switched tracks, and even received and dispatched trains. Passengers praised them as the "three-in-one personnel": they are both propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, service personnel of the revolutionary train, and guards. Once, on a train heading to Beijing, the soldier Shi Zhenrong, who was orphaned, just finished propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions with his personal feelings, and without stopping, he wiped the windows and swept the floor, doing this and that for the passengers. Passengers advised him to rest, but he replied, "No! This is a train heading to Chairman Mao's side, and I want to bring my loyalty to him!" ...

The spring breeze is favorable, and the wheels sing. The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, is flourishing. Along the line, columns of revolutionary criticism stand tall, and reports of transportation and production victories are frequent. On the people's red train, passengers coming and going from the south and north, enjoy the spring scenery of Jiangnan, and frequently wish for the future of the Shanghai-Nanjing line. Ten thousand wishes, a hundred thousand wishes, first of all, wishing our most red, most red red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

    革命是历史前进的火车头
    ——战斗的沪宁线巡礼
    卫东文　齐久文　解胜文
    “毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头”。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命战斗洗礼的沪宁铁路线，如今更加生气蓬勃。六百里蜿蜒的铁道上，列车往来如梭，“风展红旗如画”，革命春光无限好，生产热潮逐浪高。铁路沿线的广大革命职工，迎着阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同正在执行支左护路任务的六四一○部队指战员，肩并肩地在毛泽东思想的革命轨道上高歌猛进。
    沪宁线上的一片大好形势，是沿线的英雄军民同阶级敌人进行一场大搏斗取得的巨大胜利。螳臂挡车谈何易
    在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，沪宁线上展开了一场惊心动魄的阶级大搏斗。正当广大铁路职工愤怒声讨中国赫鲁晓夫和旧铁道部一小撮走资派企图在沪宁线复辟资本主义的罪行的时候，正当苏南地区两条路线斗争的风雷空前激荡的时候，一些蛰居的反革命爬虫争相出洞，打着“造反”的旗号，死保一小撮走资派，猖狂地向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部和广大无产阶级革命派进攻。由党内一小撮走资派直接操纵的李顺之、戚拯反革命小集团，就曾得意忘形地麇集在沪宁沿线，发出“挺身走险，武斗解决问题”，“两派武斗，我越看越高兴”的嚎叫。他们把罪恶的黑手伸进沪宁沿线的城乡，制造群众组织的对立，挑动武斗。
    就在这阶级大搏斗的关键时刻，我们的伟大领袖毛主席视察了华北、中南和华东地区，作了一系列极为重要的指示。也就在这个时候，担任支左任务的六四一○部队，坚持“支左不支派”的原则，和革命群众共同担起护路重任。在阶级敌人挑起两派革命群众组织严重对峙时，指战员们不顾个人安危，昼夜巡视铁道，守护信号设备，跨上机车和司机并肩战斗，保证列车正常运行。毛主席的最新指示一传出，他们就连夜出动，挨门逐户给沿线所有站、段直到铁路两侧的广大农村传送春风。毛主席的最新指示，武装了广大革命职工，形成了一股巨大的力量。沿线的英雄军民，牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，把铁路大权紧紧地掌握在自己手中，把枪口、铁拳对准一小撮阶级敌人，向作恶多端的李、戚反革命小集团发动了猛烈的进攻。
    有一次，当李、戚反革命小集团的坏蛋黄盘林以
  “造反”为名，“命令”某给水所的职工全部撤离生产岗位，想制造停水停车事件时，这个给水所的革命职工用毛泽东思想识破了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，立即给以坚决打击。他们说：“我们工人只听毛主席的命令，毛主席叫我们‘抓革命，促生产’，我们就一步也不离开战斗岗位！”
    还有一次，李、戚反革命小集团在××地方一再挑起武斗，严重威胁着全线的行车安全。在这紧急关头，无限忠于毛主席的解放军战士和苏州电务段的二十多名革命职工，挺身而出，高声朗读毛主席语录：
  “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”铁路工人在毛主席指示的鼓舞下，在解放军战士的掩护下，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。
    螳臂挡车谈何易。去年，当李、戚反革命小集团在沪宁沿线疯狂地进行破坏活动时，曾经利令智昏、得意忘形地叫嚣：“京（指南京）沪线可以说尽在我们掌握之下了。”可是，历史的车轮决不会随着一小撮反革命小丑的如意算盘倒转。随着毛主席最新指示在沪宁沿线条条落实，一小撮反革命小丑就陷入革命群众的汪洋大海包围之中。今日沪宁线上，处处可以看到解放军战士和革命职工在热情地宣传毛泽东思想；南来北往的货车满载着各种物资送往全国各地。革命的列车正沿着毛泽东思想的轨道胜利飞奔！烈火围着派性烧
    在向一小撮走资派和李、戚反革命小集团作斗争中，沪宁线的广大革命职工深深体会到：资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是一条大毒蛇。他们说：“派性的反动性，就反动在它被敌人利用。”他们在六四一○部队的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，大学大用毛主席关于“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”和“各自多做自我批评”、“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，发动了一场围剿派性的“人民战争”，把六百里沪宁铁路变成斗私批修的战线。大家越学越觉得自己的阶级兄弟亲，越学越恨一小撮阶级敌人，越学越恨资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，越学越加快了革命大联合和革命三结合的步伐。
    戚墅堰机车车辆工厂这个有七十年历史的老厂，有一段时间，阶级敌人的黑手也曾伸到这里，挑动革命群众组织的严重对立。正在这个时候，毛主席派来的亲人解放军，帮助两派办起了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，大家大学大用毛主席的最新指示，大抓阶级教育，干部和群众、头头和群众、职工和家属、指战员和革命派战友，一起忆苦思甜，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，斩掉黑手，终于很快实现了革命大联合。革命职工说：“我们是派性的受害者，也是派性的掘墓人。”他们还召开了围剿派性的万人大会，进一步从思想上巩固和发展了革命大联合，促进了革命三结合。目前，沪宁全线六十一个车站和各个线路区，已经全部实现了革命大联合。
    春风送暖满路红。广大革命职工在六四一○部队的帮助下，乘革命大联合的东风，提出“铁拳对着私心捣，烈火围着派性烧”的行动口号，在干部问题上发动了一场斗私批修的进攻战，力争以最快的速度实现革命的三结合。在这个革命新高潮中，全线最早实现革命大联合的浒墅关车站，又一马当先，建立了革命三结合领导班子。这个站，人少站小志气大，他们坚决排除干扰，豪迈地说：“我们不要派旗，我们要毛泽东思想伟大红旗。”一枝红梅报春讯，不尽春潮滚滚来。现在，沪宁沿线一大批基层的革命三结合领导班子已经纷纷胜利诞生。喜报向着太阳笑
    “红旗迎着春风舞，喜报向着太阳笑。”革命大联合和革命三结合的澎湃春潮，大大加快了沪宁沿线革命职工响应毛主席“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”伟大号召的战斗步伐，一场比学赶帮的铁路运输生产热潮掀起了。沿线各站段的出勤率大大提高，超过了历年来的最高水平。沿线各站的货运工作都做到了随到随装，随到随卸。
    在这场铁路运输生产热潮中，广大革命职工念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。无论是职工还是家属，都坚持人人读宝书，天天读宝书的制度。毛泽东思想染红了铁路革命职工的灵魂，沪宁线上的好人好事不断涌现。
    有一次，常州车站货运部门正处在上下两班交接的时候，一下来了七十八节车皮的物资。大家考虑到，如果按常规卸车，势必影响车皮周转，造成物资积压，于是决定连续突击。这时，已经洗了澡、换了衣服的上一班工人不顾休息，又回来和本班工人并肩作战，经过短短时间的紧张抢卸，提前完成了任务。黄渡车站有十二名老工人，平均年龄四十五岁。他们人老心红干劲大，四个月来，不管刮风下雨，无一缺勤，已经连续一千八百多天没有发生差错和事故，成了“老来红小分队”。
    镇江站老扳道工人姚洪喜，旧社会他受尽压迫，新社会他当家作主，念念不忘毛主席的恩情。在文化大革命中，支左的解放军和站上的职工帮助他学习“老三篇”。他听一句，记一句，用一句。他常说：“毛主席教导我们‘全心全意地为人民服务’，我们就要一个字一个字地照着去做，不能打折扣。”三月一日傍晚，他正在镇江站隧道西口二号扳道房值班，等待从上海开来的七十四次快车通过道口，突然发现一列货车从岔道向正道驶来。这时，七十四次快车就要来了，眼看一场撞车的严重事故就要发生，老姚不顾危险，奋力冲着货车奔去，连连打着停车的手势。司机一见，立即紧急刹车。货车刚在道岔口刹住，七十四次快车就从正道飞驰过去了。一场重大事故避免了。事后，同志们无不为老姚的英雄行为所感动，老姚却说：“没有什么，为人民服务嘛，应该这样。”
    在沿线执行支左任务的六四一○部队指战员，除了随时随地宣传毛泽东思想以外，还同革命职工一起，跟车执勤，护卫铁路，售票，检票，接线，扳道，甚至接发列车，样样都干。旅客们称赞他们是“三大员”：既是毛泽东思想宣传员，又是革命列车的勤务员和警卫员。有一次，在开往北京的列车上，孤儿出身的战士史樟荣刚用自己的切身感受宣传了毛主席最新指示，又一刻不停地擦窗扫地，为旅客干这干那。旅客们劝他歇会儿，他回答说：“不啦！这是开往毛主席身边去的列车啊，我要把自己的一份忠心带给他老人家！”……
    春风得意，车轮欢唱。沪宁铁路在毛泽东思想阳光普照下，欣欣向荣。沿线站段，革命大批判专栏林立，运输生产捷报频传。在人民的红色列车上，南来北往的旅客，饱览江南春色，为沪宁沿线的未来频频祝愿。千祝愿，万祝愿，首先祝愿的是：我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
