The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is flying high in the wind. The strategy and tactics of people's war are shaking the world. The people's armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party are growing stronger in battle. The people's armed forces study Chairman Mao's works, are full of vigor and fighting spirit, and have repeatedly defeated the reactionary government's "encirclement and suppression."

Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: Our correspondent reports that the people's armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and using the strategy and tactics of people's war. They are bravely fighting against the "encirclement and suppression" by the Burmese reactionary government and are reporting victories frequently.

With the support of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique, the Burmese reactionary government has re-equipped the reactionary army, which has been beaten to a pulp by the people's armed forces, with American weapons. They have expanded into the "77th" and "88th" divisions, specifically to deal with the people's armed forces. Wherever these reactionary troops go, they burn, kill, and loot, committing all sorts of atrocities. They have imprisoned many innocent farmers, regardless of age or gender, in concentration camps and subjected them to various forms of persecution.

The Burmese Communist Party, led by Chairman Thakin Than Tun, has called on all party members, the people's army, guerrillas, militias, and revolutionary masses to resolutely smash the enemy's arrogant attacks. In mobilizing for battle, Chairman Thakin Than Tun pointed out: "The enemy's divisions are nothing to be afraid of. They are the same troops that we have beaten recently. What they call a division is just a change of number. We should see them as our defeated enemies." Under the leadership and inspiration of the Burmese Communist Party, the people's armed forces have actively and proactively engaged in the anti-"encirclement and suppression" battles.

Since last August, the Burmese reactionary government has concentrated its forces to attack the revolutionary base areas of the Burmese Communist Party in the Bekko Mountains and other places. The people's armed forces in the Bekko Mountains revolutionary base area, based on studying Chairman Mao's works and criticizing revisionist thought, are full of vigor and fighting spirit, and have severely beaten the invading enemy. A reactionary army of the Burmese government, as soon as it entered the revolutionary base area of Bimaw County, was attacked by militias. On the Zhoubin-E-Danpao road, it was ambushed by the people's armed forces and suffered heavy casualties. In the Bago area, the people's armed forces annihilated dozens of enemy soldiers. In the Myaing area, the people's armed forces also annihilated a small enemy unit. The people's armed forces have thus beaten the enemy into a state of disarray.

The Burmese people's armed forces, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "strategically, we must despise all enemies; tactically, we must take all enemies seriously," have concentrated superior forces in specific battles to annihilate the enemy's effective strength. On November 21st last year, when the fully American-equipped enemy's 1st Battalion of the Chin Regiment was "sweeping" at the foot of the Bekko Mountains, the people's armed forces in Daya Wa Dyi Township ambushed two platoons of enemy troops transporting supplies to Yawla Village and annihilated this enemy force. In this battle, the people's armed forces captured one mortar, nine guns of various types, and a large amount of military supplies. Female soldiers and militiamen armed with muskets, spears, or large knives participated in this battle. After the battle, the people's armed forces educated and released the prisoners and then calmly moved to a safe area.

In the face of the enemy's attacks, the Burmese people's armed forces use flexible guerrilla tactics, seize every opportunity, and take the initiative to attack. On January 2nd of this year, the people's armed forces used a surprise attack to capture a police outpost heavily guarded by the enemy at the western gate of Bekko City, killing six enemy soldiers and capturing a batch of guns and ammunition, and returned victorious. On February 16th and 17th, the people's armed forces attacked reactionary police in the Yan Gyi Bin and Anlan areas, killing ten enemy soldiers and capturing all their weapons.

The Burmese people's armed forces are also active along the Yangon-Bimaw and Yangon-Mandalay railway lines, disrupting the enemy's transportation. In recent months, enemy military and cargo vehicles have often been blown over. On the evening of October 23rd last year, the people's armed forces blew up six carriages of an enemy train between Minla and Thakhin with landmines.

The people's armed forces in the northern, southern, and western regions of Burma are also actively fighting. They ambush enemy patrols, attack enemy military and police outposts, and disrupt enemy transportation lines, achieving many victories. On August 18th last year, the people's armed forces in the Derindaing area captured a reactionary police outpost on the Danlou-Tuwa road, seizing light machine guns, submachine guns, and twenty-six rifles, along with a batch of ammunition. On December 19th, more than two hundred people's armed forces attacked the Danlou ammunition depot. On December 29th, the Burmese Communist Party's sea guerrillas intercepted five fishing boats of the reactionary government. The enemy sent a company of troops to seize the fishing boats, and the people's armed forces ambushed them on their march, capturing more than thirty enemy soldiers and seizing more than thirty guns of various types. On March 4th of this year, about two hundred people's armed forces led by the National Democratic United Front captured a police station on the east bank of the Sittang River in Thayet District. On March 6th, more than two hundred people's armed forces captured Akyab Town in Arakan State, occupying the town for twenty-four hours and seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition.

The people's armed forces active in the Irrawaddy Delta region, following Chairman Thakin Than Tun's teaching of "not fearing sacrifice, daring to struggle, and daring to win," are bravely fighting the enemy and reporting inspiring victories. Recently, the people's armed forces in Minbu County have fought three brilliant battles in active offensives. They captured two reactionary government ships, one radio transceiver, and a large amount of combat supplies. After they captured the fishing boat "Yayang" No. 14 on December 21st, the enemy, in a fit of rage, sent a battalion of troops in nine vessels to counterattack, attempting to seize back the fishing boat. However, due to the masses blocking the news, the enemy searched for more than ten days without results. At this time, the people's armed forces, taking advantage of the enemy's rear being empty, attacked Mawgyi, killing nine enemy soldiers and forcing the enemy to retreat in panic after hearing the news.

The great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, said: "The deepest source of the great power of war lies in the masses of the people." (See attached picture)

    毛泽东思想伟大红旗迎风招展　人民战争战略战术威震四方
    缅共领导的人民武装在战斗中成长壮大
    人民武装大学毛主席著作，意气风发斗志昂扬，粉碎缅甸反动派“围剿”连连取胜
    新华社二十六日讯　本社记者报道：缅甸共产党领导的人民武装，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，运用人民战争的战略战术，在缅甸反动政府的“围剿”面前，英勇作战，捷报频传。
    缅甸反动政府在美帝国主义和苏修领导集团的支持下，把已经被人民武装打得焦头烂额的反动军队，用美国武器重新装备起来，扩编成“七十七”和“八十八”两个师，专门对付人民武装。这些反动军队所到之处，烧杀抢掠，无恶不作。他们把许多无辜农民，不分男女老幼关进集中营里，进行种种迫害。
    英勇的缅甸共产党领导全体革命人民，对缅甸反动政府的“围剿”进行了针锋相对的斗争。缅共中央号召全体党员、人民军、游击队、民兵和革命群众，坚决粉碎敌人的猖狂进攻。缅甸共产党中央委员会主席德钦丹东同志在进行战斗动员时指出：“敌人的师并不可怕，他们就是那些不久前被我们打击的军队。所谓师，实际上是换了一个番号而已，应该看到他们是我们的手下败将。”在缅甸共产党的领导和鼓舞下，缅甸人民武装积极、主动地投入了反“围剿”作战。
    去年八月以来，缅甸反动政府就集中兵力进攻缅共武装革命根据地勃固山区等地。勃固山区革命根据地的人民武装，在大学毛主席著作批判修正主义思想的基础上，意气风发，斗志昂扬，狠狠打击了前来进犯的敌人。缅甸政府的一支反动军队，刚刚进入卑谬县革命根据地，就遭到民兵的袭击。在周彬埃—德潘巧公路上，又遭到人民武装伏击，伤亡惨重。在包康区，人民武装消灭敌军十几人。在敏拉区，人民武装也全歼敌人一支小部队。人民武装就这样把敌人打得狼狈不堪。
    缅甸人民武装，根据伟大领袖毛主席“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的教导，在具体战斗中注意集中优势兵力，以歼灭敌人的有生力量。去年十一月二十一日，正当全副美式装备的敌军钦第一营在勃固山脚下进行“扫荡”的时候，达雅瓦底县人民武装伏击了向姚拉村运送物资的两班敌军，全部歼灭了这股敌人。在这次战斗中，人民武装缴获迫击炮一门，各种枪九支，以及许多军用物资。参加这次战斗的有女战士，以及手持土枪、梭标或大刀的民兵。战斗结束后，人民武装对俘虏进行教育予以释放，然后从容地转移到安全地区。
    在敌人的进攻面前，缅甸人民武装运用机动灵活的游击战术，抓紧一切时机，主动出击。今年一月二日，人民武装采用突然袭击的办法，攻占了敌军重兵驻守的勃固城西门的一个警察哨所，消灭敌人六名，缴获一批枪支和子弹，胜利而归。二月十六日和十七日，人民武装分别在良礼彬和昂兰地区，袭击反动警察，消灭敌人十名，缴获了他们的全部武器。
    缅甸人民武装还活跃在仰光—卑谬和仰光—曼德勒铁路沿线，破坏敌人的交通运输。几个月来，敌人的军车和货车，常常被炸翻。去年十月二十三日晚上，人民武装在敏拉和昔昆之间，用地雷炸翻了敌人一列火车的六节车皮。
    缅甸北部、南部、西部等地区的人民武装，也都主动出击，积极战斗。他们伏击敌人的巡逻队，袭击敌人军警哨所，破坏敌人交通运输线，取得了许多胜利，去年八月十八日，德林达依地区人民武装攻克丹老—土瓦公路上一反动警察据点，缴获轻机枪、冲锋枪和步枪二十六支和一批弹药。十二月十九日，人民武装二百多人袭击了丹老军火库。十二月二十九日，土瓦缅共海上游击队截获反动政府五艘渔轮，敌人派一连兵力赶来抢夺渔轮，人民武装在敌人行军途中打了一场漂亮的伏击战，俘虏敌军三十多名，缴获各种枪三十多支。今年三月四日，民族民主团结阵线领导下的克伦族人民武装约二百人，攻占了东吁县昔当河东岸的一所警察局。三月六日，人民武装二百多人攻克若开邦安镇，占领该镇二十四小时，缴获一大批武器和弹药。
    活跃在伊洛瓦底江三角洲地区的人民武装，按照德钦丹东主席“不怕牺牲，敢于斗争，敢于胜利”的教导，英勇杀敌，传出了振奋人心的捷报。不久前，渺?县人民武装，在主动出击中接连打了三次漂亮仗。他们缴获反动政府轮船两艘，无线电收发报机一部和许多作战物资。当他们在十二月二十一日缴获渔轮“雅仰”十四号之后，敌人老羞成怒，从毛礼派出一营兵力，分乘九艘舰艇进行反扑，企图夺回渔轮。但是，由于群众封锁消息，敌人搜索十多天毫无结果。这时，人民武装乘敌人后方空虚之际，袭击了毛礼，消灭敌军九名，迫使敌人闻讯后慌忙退了回去。
    世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”（附图片）
    缅甸人民武装在反“围剿”作战中的不断胜利，又一次证明了这个放之四海而皆准的真理。缅甸共产党领导的人民武装正在进行射击练兵　新华社发
