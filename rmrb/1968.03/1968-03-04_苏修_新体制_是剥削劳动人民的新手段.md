The Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique is acting in reverse, pushing forward a comprehensive restoration of capitalism with the "new economic system." This "new system," as soon as it was introduced, met with opposition from the broad masses of the Soviet people. This has caused the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to panic. Thus, on the one hand, they issued a resolution in the name of the Central Committee of the CPSU to "strengthen labor discipline," forcibly pushing the "new system"; on the other hand, they boasted loudly, falsely claiming that the "new system" has "improved the material well-being of the Soviet people," "reflects the common fundamental interests of all the Soviet people," and that the implementation of the "new system" has made "the Soviet people eat better, dress better, and their spiritual life more colorful and rich," and so on, boasting to the skies, attempting to deceive the Soviet people.

However, lies cannot cover up the facts. The crimes committed after the implementation of the "new system" have completely exposed the lies of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique.

The "new system" is a new shackle around the necks of the broad masses of the Soviet people.

The "new system" places material incentives of capitalism in the first place. The Soviet revisionist clique boasts that bonuses and other material incentives can increase workers' wages and "increase personal income." This is pure deception. Who exactly has their "personal income increased"? For the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, it is like a mute eating dumplings—knowing the truth in their hearts. The "new system" stipulates that bonuses are distributed according to wage levels, meaning that those with high wages can get high bonuses. As a result, the majority of the bonuses fall into the pockets of the high-salary strata such as factory directors and engineers. For example, in a glass factory in Gomel, in one quarter of 1967, the bonuses given to the leadership amounted to 147.2% of their salaries, while the broad masses of workers did not receive a single kopeck.

According to the "new system," enterprise managers have the power to change workers' wage grades and bonus amounts. Thus, Soviet enterprise managers abuse their power, appropriating a large amount of bonuses for themselves. According to the Soviet revisionist newspapers' own admissions: a manager of a construction trust embezzled bonuses seven times in one month.

The Soviet "new system" also gives enterprise managers the power to hire, fire, and punish workers at will. Some enterprise managers, in order to make high profits, like capitalists, under the pretext of "reducing surplus personnel" and "tightening the organization," lay off a large number of workers, causing unemployment to soar.

These are the so-called "new system" that "reflects the common fundamental interests of all the Soviet people," the "welfare" it brings to the broad masses of Soviet workers!

"Everything for profit" is the core of the "new system." The "new system" gives Soviet enterprise managers the legal right to make huge profits.

Under the pretext of "making the price of products correspond to the labor consumption of social production," they decide to "revise" the wholesale prices of all commodities. The increase in industrial wholesale prices reaches 13 to 15 percent, with coal prices increased by 78 percent, and the wholesale prices of a large number of industrial products almost doubled. The increase in wholesale prices inevitably leads to an increase in retail prices.

In addition, the "new system" stipulates that the state only manages the amount of profit enterprises turn over, while production of what products and quality are completely ignored. In order to make profits, enterprise managers only pursue the quantity of products without regard to quality, resulting in poor product quality and reduced efficiency.

The "new system" opens wide the door for enterprises to engage in speculation. For example, the "new system" stipulates that enterprises have the right to set retail prices for new products. Thus, enterprise managers, driven by greed, arbitrarily raise the prices of "new products," or slightly modify existing products, passing them off as "new products" for high prices. Some even falsify and cheat to make money, such as stretching 40 meters of fabric into 43 meters for sale. All this actually increases the economic burden on the working people.

Lenin pointed out that in a socialist society, new capitalists who emerge "often oppress workers more severely than the old landlords and capitalists."

Today, in the Soviet Union where the "new system" is being vigorously implemented, such a situation has emerged. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's evil purpose in pushing the "new economic system" is to fully restore and consolidate the capitalist system in the Soviet Union, using the state machine to exploit the working people to the bone. This nakedly exposes the greedy, blood-sucking, bourgeois face of this traitor clique, exposing their counter-revolutionary nature.

### 苏修“新体制”是剥削劳动人民的新手段

    苏修“新体制”是剥削劳动人民的新手段
    北京轧钢三厂工人　洪萱
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团，倒行逆施，在国内推行了全面复辟资本主义的“新经济体制”。这个“新体制”一出笼就遭到了广大苏联劳动人民的反对。这使苏修叛徒集团恐慌万分。于是，他们一面以苏共中央的名义，作出了什么“加强劳动纪律”的决议，强制推行“新体制”；一面大吹牛皮，胡说什么“新体制”“提高了苏联人民的物质福利”，“体现着全体苏联人民的共同根本利益”，实行了“新体制”使“苏联人吃的穿的更好了，他们的精神生活面貌更加丰富多彩”，如此等等，吹得天花乱坠，妄图愚弄苏联人民。
    但是，谎言掩盖不了事实。“新体制”推行后的累累罪证，完全戳穿了苏修叛徒集团的骗人鬼话。
      “新体制”完全是套在苏联广大劳动人民脖子上的新枷锁。
    “新体制”把资本主义的物质刺激提到了首位。苏修集团却吹嘘说，奖金等物质刺激可以提高工人劳动报酬，
  “使私人收入增加”。这纯粹是欺人之谈。到底是什么人“私人收入增加”？对苏修叛徒集团说来，那真是哑巴吃饺子——心中有数。“新体制”规定奖金是按工资比例发的，就是说，高工资的就可以得高奖金。结果，奖金的绝大部分落入厂长、工程师这些高薪阶层的腰包里。例如，戈米尔的一个玻璃厂，在一九六七年一个季度发给领导人员的奖金竟等于他们薪金的百分之一四七点二，而广大工人却分文未得。
    根据“新体制”规定，企业负责人有权改变工人工资级别和奖金数目。这样，苏修企业负责人就滥用权力，把大量奖金据为己有。据苏修报纸自己招认：一个建筑业托拉斯经理一个月内吞占了七次奖金。
    苏修的“新体制”还给了企业负责人自行招收、解雇、处罚工人的权力。一些企业负责人为了牟取高额利润，象资本家一样，借口“裁减多余人员”和“紧缩编制”，大量解雇工人，使得失业激增。
    这些就是所谓“体现着全体苏联人民的共同根本利益”的“新体制”，给广大苏联工人增加的“福利”！
      “一切为了利润”是“新体制”的核心。“新体制”给了苏修企业负责人大赚卢布的合法权利。
    他们在所谓“使产品的价格符合社会生产支付的劳动消耗”的幌子下，决定全部“修改”商品的批发价格，工业品批发价格提高幅度达百分之十三到十五，其中煤提高了百分之七十八，大量的工业品批发价格几乎提高了一倍。批发价格的提高必然影响到零售价格提高。
    此外“新体制”规定国家只管企业上交利润的数字，至于生产什么产品，质量如何，全都不管。为了牟取利润，企业负责人只追求产品数量而不顾质量，致使产品质量低劣，使用效率降低。
      “新体制”给企业大开投机取巧的方便之门。例如，“新体制”规定企业有权规定新产品零售价格，于是利欲熏心的企业负责人，就任意提高“新产品”的售价，或将原有产品稍加装潢，冒充“新产品”高价出售。有的甚至弄虚作假，骗人赚钱，例如把四十米衣料硬拉成四十三米出售。这一切实际上增加了劳动人民的经济负担。
    列宁指出，在社会主义社会中新产生的资本家，“他们往往比旧的地主和资本家更厉害地压迫工人”。
    今天，在“新体制”加紧实施的苏联，这种情景出现了。苏修叛徒集团推行“新经济体制”的罪恶目的，是要在苏联全面复辟和巩固资本主义制度，运用国家机器对劳动人民进行敲骨吸髓的剥削。这就赤裸裸地暴露了这伙叛徒贪婪榨取人民血汗的资产阶级的狰狞面目，暴露了他们的反革命嘴脸。
