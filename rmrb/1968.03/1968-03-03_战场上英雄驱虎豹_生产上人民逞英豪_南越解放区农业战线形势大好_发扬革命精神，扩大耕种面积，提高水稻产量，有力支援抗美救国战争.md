Heroes Drive Tigers and Leopards on the Battlefield, People Display Heroism in Production

The agricultural front in the liberated areas of South Vietnam is in an excellent situation. Carrying forward the revolutionary spirit, expanding the cultivated area, and increasing the rice yield, they have powerfully supported the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation.

HANOI, March 2 (Xinhua) — Our correspondent reports: The heroic people of the liberated areas of South Vietnam achieved brilliant results in 1967 while simultaneously displaying unyielding revolutionary spirit in their struggle against the enemy on another front—the agricultural production front. They have achieved significant results, powerfully supporting the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation.

Last year, under intense combat conditions, the cultivated area in the liberated areas of South Vietnam increased significantly compared to the previous year, exceeding the production plan. The total rice yield in various regions was higher than the previous year to varying degrees. The harvest of miscellaneous grains and tubers was also generally better than in previous years. In some places, even in areas of intense combat such as New Chu County in New An Province, Cai Lay County in My Tho Province, and the northern part of Tan Thuan, the rice yield increased by several times or even doubled. The brilliant achievements of the South Vietnamese people in agricultural production, along with their great victories on the battlefield, shine brightly, radiating the glory of people's war.

The good harvest of grain that the South Vietnamese people achieved last year was obtained through unyielding struggle against the enemy. The desperate American imperialists and their lackeys used various evil means to create great difficulties for the agricultural production of the South Vietnamese people. However, as the great leader Chairman Mao taught, "No difficulty can stop the revolutionary people from advancing." Under the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the South Vietnamese people resolutely overcame all the difficulties created by the enemy. To defeat the enemy's "sweeping" plots, to persist in production, and to defend production, brave South Vietnamese farmers put forward the battle slogan, "Fight when the enemy comes, work when the enemy retreats." When the enemy comes to "sweep," they take up arms and fight alongside the people's liberation armed forces; when the enemy is defeated or driven away, they return to the fields to continue working. To cope with the enemy's aerial bombardment, they work in the fields at night when they cannot work during the day. The enemy dropped tens of thousands of tons of bombs, but they could not shake the iron will of the South Vietnamese farmers. They planted corn and cassava on the edges of bomb craters; in many places, the enemy, in order to destroy production, madly killed draft animals and destroyed farming tools. In some communes in Quang Nam and Binh Dinh provinces, only five to ten draft animals remained, but this did not deter the tenacious South Vietnamese farmers. They used human labor to replace the draft animals and continued to cultivate the land on time. When the enemy sprayed chemical poisons to destroy crops, the unyielding South Vietnamese farmers replanted immediately after the enemy destroyed a crop, thwarting the enemy's plot to disrupt production. To resist the enemy's sabotage and natural disasters and strive for a bumper harvest, South Vietnamese farmers also organized production. Last year, mutual aid teams and labor exchange teams spread throughout the South, effectively promoting production.

The South Vietnamese farmers not only displayed unyielding spirit in their struggle against the enemy and persisted in production but also took various measures to increase production. Last year, farmers in some places changed old habits and began to plant double-crop and triple-crop rice. Previously, provinces like Ben Tre, Chau Doc, Long An, Sa Dec, An Xuyen, and My Tho, which were accustomed to planting single-crop rice, planted a lot of double-crop rice last year. Farmers in various regions also combined the construction of "battle villages" and "battle communes" with large-scale water conservancy projects. The new water conservancy projects in the Mekong Delta provinces increased by onefold compared to the previous year.

The great leader Chairman Mao taught: "The deepest source of the great power of war lies among the people." Millions of South Vietnamese people, to ensure the victory of the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation, put forward the resounding slogans, "The frontline does not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice, the rear does not hesitate to expend manpower and resources" and "Everything for the frontline." They enthusiastically paid public grain taxes to support the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation. Every household took pride in paying first and paying more. They dried the grain thoroughly and carried it day and night to the payment points.

Chairman Mao pointed out: The true "iron wall" is "tens of millions of people who genuinely support the revolution." In the face of tens of millions of South Vietnamese people who are united, resolute, tenacious, and genuinely support the revolution, the American imperialist beast can only be burned to death in the flames of people's war.

    战场上英雄驱虎豹　生产上人民逞英豪
    南越解放区农业战线形势大好
    发扬革命精神，扩大耕种面积，提高水稻产量，有力支援抗美救国战争
    新华社河内一日电　本社记者报道：英雄的越南南方解放区人民，一九六七年在取得辉煌战绩的同时，以坚韧不拔的革命精神，与敌人作针锋相对的斗争，在抗美救国的另一条战线——农业生产上，取得了重大成绩，有力地支援了抗美救国战争。
    去年，在激烈的战斗环境下，越南南方解放区耕种面积比前一年大大增加，超额完成了生产计划，各地水稻总产量都比前年有不同程度的提高，杂粮、薯类收成也普遍比往年好。有不少地方，甚至某些处在激烈战斗的地区，如新安省新柱县、美萩省丐礼县和同塔梅北部等地，水稻产量增加几成以至一倍以上。越南南方人民在农业生产上取得的这些光辉成绩，和他们在战场上取得的伟大战果交相辉映，放射出人民战争的胜利光芒。
    越南南方人民去年获得的粮食好收成，是在同敌人进行了不屈不挠的斗争中取得的。正在进行垂死挣扎的美帝国主义及其走狗，使用种种罪恶手段，给越南南方人民的农业生产造成了极大的困难。但是，正象伟大领袖毛主席教导的：“任何困难都阻挡不住革命人民的前进。”越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的正确领导下，坚决战胜了敌人所制造的各种困难。为了击败敌人的“扫荡”阴谋，坚持生产，保卫生产，英勇的南方农民提出了“敌来我打，敌退我干”的战斗口号，敌人来
  “扫荡”，他们就拿起武器，同人民解放武装力量一起，进行反“扫荡”战斗，敌人被歼灭、被打跑了，他们就回到田间继续劳动；为了对付敌机的狂轰滥炸，不误农时，农民们白天不能下田时就改在晚上下田劳动。敌机倾下成万吨的炸弹，也动摇不了南方农民的钢铁意志，他们在一小块一小块的炸弹坑边上，栽种了玉米和木薯；在不少地方，敌人为了破坏生产，疯狂地杀死耕牛、毁坏农具，如广南省和建丰省的一些乡，只剩下五到十头耕牛，但这也难不倒顽强的南方农民，他们以人力来代替，照样不误农时地耕种；敌人喷撒化学毒药毁坏农作物，不屈的南方农民，在敌人毁坏了一片庄稼之后，他们立即补种上，使敌人破坏生产的阴谋不能得逞；为了抵御敌人的破坏和天灾，争取丰收，南方农民还组织起来进行生产。去年，互助组、变工队已经遍及南方各地，有力地促进了生产。
    越南南方农民，不仅以坚强不屈的精神同敌人作斗争，坚持生产，而且还采取各种措施来增加生产。去年，一些地方的农民，改变旧习惯，开始种植双季稻、三季稻，以前一向习惯种单季稻的槟椥、朱笃、龙川、堤岸、新安、沙沥、美萩等省，去年种植了许多双季稻。各地农民还结合建设“战斗村”、“战斗乡”，大兴水利。湄公河三角洲各省新修的水利工程，比前年增加了一倍。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”千千万万的越南南方人民，为了保证抗美救国战争的胜利，提出了“前线不惜流血牺牲，后方不惜人力物力”和“一切为了前线”的响亮口号，踊跃缴公粮，支援抗美救国战争。家家户户都以先缴、多缴为荣。他们把粮食打晒得干干净净，不分昼夜地赶挑到缴纳地点去。
    毛主席指出：真正的铜墙铁壁“是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众”。在千百万团结一致，坚决顽强，真心实意拥护革命的越南南方人民面前，美帝国主义这头野牛非在人民战争的烈火中烧死不可。
