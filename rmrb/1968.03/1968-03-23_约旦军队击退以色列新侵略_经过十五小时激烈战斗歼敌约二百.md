Jordanian forces repelled a new Israeli aggression after a fierce 15-hour battle, annihilating approximately 200 enemy soldiers.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 22nd, the U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, launched a sudden military aggression against Jordan on the morning of the 21st. Facing determined resistance from Jordanian forces, the Israeli aggressors were forced to begin their retreat in the evening of the 21st after 15 hours of intense combat.

According to a broadcast by Amman Radio, a statement issued by Jordan said that Jordanian forces had driven the Israeli aggressors back across the Jordan River. The Israeli forces suffered heavy losses, with many tanks and military vehicles destroyed, five aircraft shot down, and approximately 200 Israeli aggressors killed.

According to reports, a Jordanian military spokesman said that Israel deployed nearly 15,000 troops in this new aggression, making it the largest-scale aggression since Israel launched its invasion of Arab countries in June last year.

Israel's new aggression was carried out entirely under the repeated indulgence of U.S. imperialism. Since the beginning of this year, after Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol visited the United States, the U.S. has continued to supply weapons to Israel, fueling its aggressive ambitions. At the same time, it has actively promoted the resolution on the Middle East issue passed by the United Nations Security Council in November last year under U.S.-Soviet manipulation, attempting to force the Arab people to tolerate Israel's aggression and occupation.

    约旦军队击退以色列新侵略
    经过十五小时激烈战斗歼敌约二百
    据新华社二十二日讯 美帝国主义侵略工具以色列二十一日清晨突然发动对约旦的新的军事侵略，遭到约旦军队坚决抵抗，经过十五小时的激烈战斗后，以色列侵略军二十一日傍晚被迫开始撤退。
    据安曼电台广播，约旦发表的公报说，约旦军队已把以色列侵略军赶回到约旦河彼岸。以色列军队遭到惨重的损失，许多坦克和军车被击毁，五架飞机被击落，约二百名以色列侵略军被打死。
    据报道，约旦军方发言人说，以色列在这次新的侵略中使用了将近一万五千人，这是去年六月以色列对阿拉伯国家发动侵略以来规模最大的一次新的侵略行动。
    以色列发动的这次新侵略完全是在美帝一再纵容下进行的。自从今年年初以色列总理艾希科尔访问美国后，美国一方面继续向以色列提供武器，助长它的侵略气焰，一方面积极兜售去年十一月在美苏操纵下联合国安理会通过的关于中东问题的决议，妄图逼迫阿拉伯人民容忍以色列的侵略和占领。
