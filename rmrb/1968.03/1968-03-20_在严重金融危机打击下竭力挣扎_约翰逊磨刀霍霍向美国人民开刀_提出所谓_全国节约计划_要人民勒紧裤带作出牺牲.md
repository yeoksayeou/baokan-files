	In the face of a worsening capitalist world financial crisis, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, already flustered by the Vietnam War debacle, has become even more flustered and disoriented. This imperialist chief has been repeatedly making speeches in recent days, claiming to implement a "national austerity plan," calling on the American people to "tighten their belts," and attempting to use further exploitation of the broad masses of laborers to struggle and rescue the crisis.

	In the current gold-buying frenzy triggered by the dollar crisis, the Johnson administration, which has been hit the hardest, has completely lost its bearings. It announced a series of "emergency measures" in one night on March 14, including closing the London gold market, raising the bank discount rate, and canceling the gold backing of domestic currency; then, after hurriedly holding an emergency meeting with representatives of the main capitalist countries in Western Europe on March 16 and 17, it made the decision to effectively abolish the "gold pool" used to defend the dollar's position and allow the dollar to depreciate in the capitalist world financial market. At the same time, Johnson announced on March 16 and 18 that he would implement a "national austerity plan" and called on the American people to "tighten their belts" and "participate" in this plan to help prop up the rapidly deteriorating U.S. fiscal economy.

	According to reports, the main contents of Johnson's so-called "austerity plan" include increasing the income tax surcharge by 10%, increasing revenue by 80 to 90 billion dollars; at the same time, it includes reducing "government spending" by about 30 to 40 billion dollars; restricting private overseas investment; restricting overseas travel consumption, etc. Such an "austerity plan" fully exposes the ugly face of U.S. imperialism in sharpening its knives against the American laboring people and shifting difficulties, and also fully exposes its helpless and embarrassed state in the face of a serious crisis.

	When talking about reducing government spending, Johnson boasted that this reduction would be "comprehensive" and even "delay many necessary spending plans," but he did not allow touching the war expenses in Vietnam; in both speeches, he shouted that the United States would "do whatever is necessary" in South Vietnam to "win victory." This fully shows that the essence of his so-called "national austerity plan" is to further exploit the broad masses of the American people to ensure the economic interests of the U.S. monopoly capitalist group and to adapt to its policy of external aggression.

	Johnson's wishful thinking is doomed to fail and will lead to very serious consequences. This is because: since the end of World War II, U.S. imperialism has been crazily implementing policies of military expansion and economic plunder abroad, causing long-term deficits in international payments and fiscal budgets, continuously increasing deficits, mounting public and private debts, emptying the treasury, and exhausting gold reserves. Reducing spending by tens of billions of dollars and increasing revenue by tens of billions of dollars is originally a drop in the bucket and cannot fundamentally improve the dollar's position; while the Vietnam War is a bottomless pit, consuming more and more of the United States' financial and material resources. Therefore, under the condition that the Johnson administration continues and expands the Vietnam War, the emergency measures it plans to take are even less able to stabilize the dollar's position and restore the capitalist world's trust in the dollar.

	At the same time, the U.S. economy has shown signs of stagnation since last year, and implementing tax increases and other "tightening" measures may accelerate the arrival of the long-delayed economic crisis, causing financial and economic crises to occur simultaneously. Therefore, although the U.S. ruling class is currently struggling desperately, it is inwardly in a state of great anxiety, and many people not only doubt the effectiveness of the emergency measures recently taken by the Johnson administration in a flurry, but also are worried about the consequences that these measures may bring.

　　在严重金融危机打击下竭力挣扎
    约翰逊磨刀霍霍向美国人民开刀
    提出所谓“全国节约计划”要人民勒紧裤带作出牺牲
    新华社十九日讯　华盛顿消息：正在恶性发展的资本主义世界金融危机使得已经被侵越惨败弄得焦头烂额的美国总统约翰逊，更加手足失措，狼狈万状。这个美帝头子连日来一再发表谈话，声称要实行一项“全国节约计划”，叫嚷要美国人民“勒紧裤带”，妄图用向广大劳动人民进一步开刀的办法进行挣扎，挽救危机。
    在当前这场由美元危机引起的抢购黄金风暴中，美帝首当其冲，遭到最沉重打击的约翰逊政府完全乱了手脚。它在十四日一夜之间，接连宣布了要求关闭伦敦黄金市场、提高银行贴现率、取消国内通货的黄金保证等一系列“抢险”措施；接着，又在十六日和十七日匆匆忙忙同西欧主要资本主义国家金融资本的代表举行了紧急会议之后，作出了实际上取消用以保卫美元地位的“黄金总库”、听任美元在资本主义世界金融市场上贬值的决定。与此同时，约翰逊在十六日和十八日又接连宣布要实行一项“全国节约计划”，并且呼吁美国人民“勒紧裤带”，“参加”这项计划，以帮助支撑急剧恶化的美国财政经济。
    据报道，约翰逊心目中的所谓“节约计划”的主要内容是增加所得税附加税百分之十，增加八十亿至九十亿美元的收入；同时还包括削减“政府开支”约三十亿至四十亿美元；限制私人海外投资；限制海外旅行消费，等等。这样一个所谓“节约计划”充分地暴露了美帝国主义向美国劳动人民磨刀霍霍、转嫁困难的狰狞嘴脸，也充分地暴露了它在严重的危机面前束手无策、狼狈不堪的困窘状态。
    约翰逊在谈到削减政府开支时大肆宣扬什么这种削减将是“全面的”，甚至“将使许多必要的开支计划推迟”，但是唯独不许触动侵越战争费用；他在两次谈话中都叫嚷，美国将在南越“作必须作的一切”，以“赢得胜利”。这就完全表明，他的所谓“全国节约计划”的实质，就是要进一步压榨广大的美国人民群众，以保证美国垄断资本集团的经济利益和适应其对外侵略政策的需要。
    约翰逊的这个如意算盘是注定行不通的，而且将导致极为严重的后果。这是因为，美元问题的一个症结是：二次世界大战结束以来，美帝国主义对外疯狂实行军事扩张、经济掠夺政策，使得国际收支和财政预算长期出现亏空，赤字不断增加，公私债务累累，国库空虚，黄金储备枯竭。削减几十亿美元开支，增加几十亿美元收入，本来就是杯水车薪，无法从根本上改善美元地位；而侵越战争又是个无底洞，越来越多地消耗着美国的财力、物力。因此，在约翰逊政府继续并扩大侵越战争的情况下，它打算采取的这些应急措施，更不足以稳定美元地位，恢复资本主义世界对美元的信任。
    同时，美国经济情况从去年开始已经出现停滞的趋势，实行增税等“紧缩”措施，很可能加速拖延已久的经济危机的到来，使金融危机和经济危机同时发作。因此，虽然美国统治集团目前还在竭力挣扎，但是内心却是一片惶惶不安，许多人不仅怀疑约翰逊政府最近手忙脚乱地采取的一些应急措施的效用，而且提心吊胆地注视着这些措施可能引起的后果。
