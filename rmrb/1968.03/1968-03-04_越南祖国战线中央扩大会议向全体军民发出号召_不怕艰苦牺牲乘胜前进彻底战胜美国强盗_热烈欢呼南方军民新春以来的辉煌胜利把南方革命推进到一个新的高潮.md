The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front recently held its 15th expanded meeting, calling on the Vietnamese people and military to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's battle call, advance in victory, and completely defeat the American aggressors.

The meeting was presided over by Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Central Committee.

Attendees included Politburo members of the Vietnam Labor Party Central Committee, Chairman of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Central Committee Le Duong, and committee members Phan Khac Suu, Nguyen Huu Tho, and Truong Chinh, among others. Representatives from various political parties, organizations, and the People's Army also participated.

Nguyen Van Hieu, head of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front's permanent delegation to the North, also attended the meeting.

Nguyen Huu Tho delivered the opening speech. He enthusiastically hailed the great victories achieved by the southern military and civilians since the beginning of the year. He said that these great victories have pushed the southern revolution to a new high point, marking an important turning point in the resistance against American aggression and for national salvation. He also warmly welcomed the newly established political organizations and new patriotic armed forces in the South, urging them to join the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in fighting the enemy and resisting American aggression.

Nguyen Huu Tho called on the 31 million people of Vietnam to unite and bravely advance, defeating the American aggressors and achieving complete victory.

Le Duong, in his speech, pointed out that the task of the Vietnam Fatherland Front in 1968 is to mobilize the entire population and military to implement all the proposals of the Labor Party, government, and the Fatherland Front. It is essential to decisively thwart all new war "escalation" plots by the American aggressors, defend the North, fully support the liberation struggle of the southern compatriots, successfully complete the 1968 national plan, build a strong rear, and ensure all needs of the front line. He emphasized that we must concentrate the strength of the entire nation to realize the slogan "Everything for defeating the American aggressors," bravely advance, and achieve complete victory.

Huynh Tan Phat, representing the Vietnam Fatherland Front Central Committee, delivered a political report to the conference. He said that the strong offensive of the southern military and civilians over the past month has dealt a new fatal blow to the American imperialists and their lackeys.

He said that at present, American imperialism is still extremely stubborn and warlike. It is trying to cover up its failures, intensifying conscription and sending more troops to the South, preparing public opinion and plans for more barbaric bombing of the North, while continuing to spread peace deception to evade condemnation from world and American public opinion. The anti-American resistance war of the southern compatriots and the entire nation will still face many difficulties. Our people must remember Chairman Ho's teachings: "The closer to victory, the more difficulties will arise. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will struggle more fiercely. Therefore, our military and civilians must strengthen unity, persist in the fight, strike hard, and continuously strike to achieve greater victories."

Huynh Tan Phat said that in this intense stage of the struggle, all compatriots must respond to the sacred call of the Fatherland and Chairman Ho, for the South, for the nation, for the anti-American resistance, and for the bright future of the Fatherland, mustering all their strength and wisdom to resolutely and excellently complete all tasks.

Huynh Tan Phat pointed out that the path to complete victory for our people is clearly before us. The period of comprehensive attack and final victory has begun. The 31 million military and civilians of our nation will resolutely advance in victory, fearing no hardships or sacrifices, continuously attacking and achieving victories.

Huynh Tan Phat finally said that the southern compatriots will certainly achieve complete victory. The American aggressors and their lackeys, who are in a state of confusion in both military and political terms, will surely suffer complete defeat.

Nguyen Van Hieu, head of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front's permanent delegation to the North, also spoke at the meeting. He expressed that the southern military and civilians will advance in victory, fearing no hardships or sacrifices, continuously attacking, and resolutely completing the glorious mission assigned by history: liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately reunifying the nation.

The meeting passed a letter to the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and a statement condemning the brutal killings of civilians in southern cities by the American puppet regime.

The meeting also passed a call to action, urging all Vietnamese military and civilians to respond to Chairman Ho's sacred call, fear no hardships or sacrifices, advance in victory, and completely defeat the American aggressors.

    越南祖国战线中央扩大会议向全体军民发出号召
    不怕艰苦牺牲乘胜前进彻底战胜美国强盗
    热烈欢呼南方军民新春以来的辉煌胜利把南方革命推进到一个新的高潮
    新华社河内三日电　据这里报纸三日报道：越南祖国战线中央委员会最近举行第十五次会议（扩大），号召越南全国军民响应胡志明主席的战斗号召，乘胜前进，彻底战胜美国侵略强盗。
    会议由越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜主持。
    出席会议的有越南劳动党中央委员会政治局委员、祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员长征，以及主席团成员潘继遂、黄国越、春水等。参加大会的还有各政党、团体和人民军代表。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻北方代表团团长阮文进也出席了会议。
    孙德胜首先致开幕词。他热烈欢呼南方军民初春以来取得的巨大胜利。他说，这一巨大胜利，把南方革命推进到一个新的高潮，这是抗美救国战争的重要转折点。他还热烈欢迎南方新成立的各政治组织和新的爱国武装力量，和南方民族解放阵线一起奋起杀敌，抗美救国。
    孙德胜号召越南三千一百万人民团结一致，奋勇前进，战胜美国侵略强盗，夺取彻底的胜利。
    长征在讲话中指出，越南祖国战线一九六八年的任务是：努力动员全民、全军实现劳动党、政府和祖国战线的一切主张，坚决挫败美国强盗的一切新的战争“升级”阴谋，保卫北方，全心全力支援南方同胞的解放斗争，胜利完成一九六八年国家计划，建设强大的后方，保证前线的一切需要。他强调说，我们必须集中全国力量，实现“一切为了战胜美国侵略强盗”的口号，奋勇前进，夺取彻底的胜利。
    黄国越代表越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团向大会作了政治报告。他说，南方军民一个多月来的强大攻势，给了美帝国主义及其走狗以新的致命打击。
    他说，目前，美帝国主义还是极其顽固和好战。它极力掩盖失败，加紧征兵和向南方增派军队，为更加野蛮地轰炸北方准备舆论和制定计划，同时继续散布和平欺诈论调，以便逃避世界舆论和美国舆论的谴责。南方同胞和全国人民的抗美救国战争还要遇到许多困难。我国人民必须牢记胡主席的教导：“越接近胜利，困难将会越多。敌人就象一头走投无路的野兽，将更加疯狂地挣扎。因此，我们军民更要加强团结，坚持战斗，狠狠地打，连续地打，以夺取更大的胜利。”
    黄国越说，在这个激烈的战斗阶段里，全体同胞要响应祖国和胡主席的神圣号召，为南方，为全国，为抗美救国事业，为祖国的光明前景，拿出全部力量和智慧，坚决出色地完成一切任务。
    黄国越指出，我国人民走向彻底胜利的道路，已经明显地展现在我们眼前。全面进攻、夺取最后胜利的时期已经开始了。我国三千一百万军民坚决乘胜前进，不怕艰苦、牺牲，连续进攻，连续夺取胜利。
    黄国越最后说，南方同胞必定获得全胜。在军事和政治上被打得晕头转向的美国强盗及其走狗，必将遭到彻底失败。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻北方代表团团长阮文进也在会上发表了讲话。
    他表示南方军民将乘胜前进，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，连续进攻，狠狠地打，坚决完成历史所赋予的光荣任务：解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。
    会议通过了给南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的信和一项谴责美伪集团野蛮残杀南方城市人民血腥罪行的声明。
    会议还通过了一项号召书，号召越南全体军民响应胡主席的神圣号召，不怕艰苦、牺牲，乘胜前进，彻底战胜美国侵略强盗。
