The Revolutionary Committee of Yichun City, Heilongjiang Province, since its establishment in May last year, has closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. In the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, it has taken "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle. It has focused on the revolutionary transformation of the leading cadre group, particularly addressing the issue of how the revolutionary cadres, after seizing power, can "guard against arrogance and prevent change." By focusing on this aspect, they have greatly invigorated the revolutionary spirit, improved relations between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses, and significantly promoted the revolution and production.

Recently, the standing committee members of the Yichun City Revolutionary Committee held a discussion on how to "guard against arrogance and prevent change."

Struggle Against the "Arrogance" in Our Minds to Remain Loyal to Chairman Mao Forever

Representative of the People's Liberation Army and Chairman of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Sun Yunhan, said: How can we build a revolutionary leading cadre group that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizes proletarian politics, and is full of revolutionary spirit? This is a very important question facing the proletarian revolutionary cadres after their victory in seizing power.

Soon after the establishment of the Yichun City Revolutionary Committee, the broad revolutionary masses were all elated. However, it was not long before reports came in: some people, after joining the Revolutionary Committee, had become arrogant, did not listen to the masses' opinions, and had changed their way of life. Soon after, the following satirical poem appeared: "Chairs are moved inside, front three rows for shows, the old lord just overthrown, the young lord comes in." Why did the masses have such reflections soon after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee? Is this not the "arrogance, self-conceit, complacency, desire for enjoyment, and unwillingness to lead a hard life" that Chairman Mao had long ago foresightedly warned about? The issue of guarding against arrogance and preventing change has been brought before us.

To build a revolutionary leading cadre group, the PLA representatives participating in the "three-in-one combination" must take the lead in guarding against arrogance and preventing change, and struggle against the "arrogance" in their minds. I and my comrades studied together Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, "Study and the Situation," and the "Three Constantly Read Articles," among other brilliant works. We discovered that in our minds, we were burdened with the baggage of "supporting the left with merits" and "consistently adhering to the correct line." Because of this "arrogance," when someone praises us, we are satisfied. When we encounter differing opinions, we sometimes do not want to accept them and often act as if we are always right. This arrogant attitude unknowingly crept into the Revolutionary Committee, influencing other comrades and causing harm to the revolution.

The practice of class struggle has made me deeply realize: if there is "arrogance" in our minds, we cannot closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; with "arrogance," we will detach from the masses, affecting the relationship between superiors and subordinates; with "arrogance," there will be disunity within; with "arrogance," the desire for fame and gain will grow; with "arrogance," we will stagnate and not be able to achieve new merits for the people; with "arrogance," we will not be able to build a truly revolutionary leading cadre group. In the end, "arrogance" is a manifestation of disloyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Arrogance leads to change and revisionism; arrogance is a great enemy of the proletarian revolutionary cadres in seizing and using power correctly. Therefore, struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, guarding against arrogance and preventing change, has become a very important issue in the revolutionary transformation of the leading cadre group. New cadres need to be humble and cautious, and old cadres need to guard against arrogance and impatience. Only in this way can we remain forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and follow the great leader Chairman Mao's revolution to the end.

Eagerly Accept the Supervision of the Masses to Be a Servant of the People Forever

Revolutionary cadre representative and Vice Chairman of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Li Zhiguang, said: With arrogance, one will not listen to the masses' opinions and will not accept the masses' supervision, thus detaching from the masses. I have deep feelings about this. In the early days of the proletarian revolutionary cadres seizing power, due to the arrogant attitude of "I was the first to rebel, I have the longest tenure, and I have the highest level" in my mind, I did not welcome the criticisms and suggestions from the masses. Comrades who had rebelled with me in the past and are now working together in the Revolutionary Committee gave me some suggestions out of concern and care, but I rejected them with the excuse of "not to my taste." In this way, the masses began to distance themselves from me, and they no longer wanted to share their opinions with me. Later, through studying Chairman Mao's works, I deeply excavated the root of the "arrogance" and realized that the essence of arrogance and self-satisfaction is individualism, bourgeois, and petty-bourgeois ideology. To overcome "arrogance," one must struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, break with the old and establish the new, and uphold a thorough mass perspective.

The practice of nearly a year of working in the Revolutionary Committee has made me deeply realize: "arrogance" is the beginning of "change." With the "arrogance," Chairman Mao's instructions cannot be learned, the masses' opinions cannot be heard, and one cannot keep up or rely on the masses. If one is not vigilant, it will inevitably lead to detachment from the masses and from Mao Zedong Thought, and one will repeat the mistakes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. Any member of the Revolutionary Committee can only be a servant of the people and never an official or a lord. Therefore, all members of the Revolutionary Committee must place themselves under the supervision of the masses and eagerly accept the masses' supervision.

Always Be One with the Masses to Maintain the Character of the Working Class

Revolutionary mass representative and Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Lin Yunxi, said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." I was originally a grain shop clerk and was elected into the Revolutionary Committee. Sometimes I sat in the office, and I also often went out to attend meetings and give reports. Gradually, I had less contact with my former colleagues who I used to be with every day. One day I went back to the grain shop, and as soon as I entered the door, I saw many people buying grain, so I hurriedly went forward to help carry the sacks. Who would have thought that as soon as I stretched out my hand, a comrade quickly stopped me and said, "Don't carry it, or you'll get flour all over you!" At first, I did not pay much attention to this, but later, when I thought about it carefully, I was shocked: I had only been away for a few days, and everyone had started to treat me differently. If this continued, wouldn't I eventually detach from the masses? I reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on "wholeheartedly serving the people and never detaching from the masses" and decided to act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. From then on, in addition to sometimes participating in the Standing Committee's meetings to decide on major issues, I still worked with the comrades in the grain shop to sell grain and carry sacks as before. The revolutionary masses became close to me again. Later, I felt that just participating in the grain selling labor was not enough. As a leading member of the Revolutionary Committee, I should often go to the masses, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. With the support of the Revolutionary Committee, I often went to the grassroots production units and streets, worked and studied Mao Zedong Thought with the workers and peasants, and gave lectures to the masses using a magic lantern to conduct class education. By often going deep into the masses, I realized that the broad workers and peasants have the highest consciousness and the deepest class feelings for Chairman Mao, and they listen to Chairman Mao the most. Only by often being with the masses, being a small student of the masses, and learning from the masses, can one forever maintain the character of a proletarian fighter and be a good servant of the people.

Actively Learn and Apply Chairman Mao's Works to Grasp the Root of Guarding Against Arrogance and Preventing Change

Revolutionary mass representative and Vice Chairman of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Chen Rongyu, said: I was originally a worker. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, I rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. At that time, every time I studied a section of Chairman Mao's quotations, I felt very close to them and was greatly inspired and strengthened. After seizing power, I was elected to work in the Revolutionary Committee. At the beginning, no matter how late the work was every day, I insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and, based on my work that day, checked which things were done right and which were done wrong, found the direction and methods for the next day's work, and then went to sleep. Although the work was very difficult at that time, my mind was clear, I did not detach from the masses, and I followed Chairman Mao's strategic deployment relatively closely.

However, after a period of work, I had grasped some work rules, the pressure was reduced, and I relaxed my study of Chairman Mao's works and was not strict with myself. The "arrogance" then took the opportunity to sneak in. From then on, I spent more time in the office attending meetings and handling affairs and less time with the masses. When talking with the masses, I often appeared in the attitude of an educator, feeling that I was more brilliant than others. Later, a comrade, in order to help me, gave me four quotations from Chairman Mao. At that time, I did not understand it very well, but after calming down, I compared my thoughts and actions with these four quotations from Chairman Mao and found that they had deviated from Chairman Mao's teachings, mainly because I had developed an arrogant attitude in my mind. I brought this problem and restudied Chairman Mao's teachings on "We should be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people." I realized that if the arrogant attitude developed, it would make me gradually become a high-and-mighty official, and I would walk the old road of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party again, and eventually be abandoned by the revolutionary people. After tracing the root of the problem, I realized that the arrogant attitude was because I had relaxed my active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works. I deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, and we cannot do without it for a moment. From then on, I grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works again and insisted on using Chairman Mao's teachings to examine and check my thoughts and actions. The work situation improved. I am determined to study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, maintain a humble and cautious style for a lifetime, and revolutionize with the revolutionary masses for a lifetime.

### 斗私批修　戒骄防变——伊春市革命委员会常委座谈领导班子思想革命化

　　斗私批修　戒骄防变
　　——伊春市革命委员会常委座谈领导班子思想革命化
    本报讯　黑龙江省伊春市革命委员会，从去年五月成立以来，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓领导班子的思想革命化，突出地解决无产阶级革命派掌权后如何“戒骄防变”的问题。他们狠抓这个环节，大大振奋了革命精神，改善了上下级关系和干群关系，对革命和生产起了很大的推动作用。
    最近，伊春市革命委员会的常委就如何“戒骄防变”问题举行了座谈。
    狠斗头脑中的“骄”字  才能永远忠于毛主席
    解放军代表、市革委会主任孙云汉说：怎样把革命委员会建设成高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，朝气蓬勃的革命的领导班子？这是无产阶级革命派夺权胜利以后，面临的一个十分重要的问题。
    伊春市革命委员会一成立，广大革命群众无不欢欣鼓舞。但是不久就听到反映：有的人到革委会以后“架子大了”，“听不进群众意见了”，“生活也变样了”。紧接着，又出现了“沙发往里抬，看戏前三排，老爷刚打倒，少爷又进来”的打油诗。为什么革命委员会成立不久，群众就有了这样的反映呢？这不正是毛主席早已英明预见的“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪”开始在生长吗？戒骄防变的问题提到我们面前来了。
    为了建设一个革命的领导班子，参加“三结合”的解放军代表，必须带头戒骄防变，狠斗头脑中的“骄”字。我和同志们一道学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告、《学习和时局》、“老三篇”等光辉著作，发现自己思想上背着“支左有功”、“一贯坚持正确方针”的包袱。由于有了“骄”字，别人说个好，就心满意足。碰到不同意见，有时不愿接受，常常表现自以为是。这种骄傲情绪在不知不觉中带到了革委会，影响了别的同志，给革命带来了损害。
    阶级斗争实践，使我深深体会到：思想上有了“骄”，就不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署；有了“骄”就要脱离群众，影响上下级关系；有了“骄”内部就要发生不团结；有了“骄”就必然滋长名利思想；有了“骄”就必然停滞不前，不能为人民立新功；有了“骄”也就不能建设一个真正革命化的领导班子。归根到底，“骄”是对伟大领袖毛主席，对毛泽东思想，对毛主席革命路线不忠的表现。骄则要变、要修，骄是无产阶级革命派夺权胜利后掌好权用好权的一个大敌。因此，斗私批修，戒骄防变，就成为当前领导班子思想革命化的一个十分重要的问题。新干部需要谦虚、谨慎，老干部更需要戒骄、戒躁。这样，才能永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远紧跟伟大领袖毛主席革命到底。
    热忱接受群众监督  永远做人民勤务员
    革命干部代表、市革委会副主任李植光说：有了骄气就必然听不进群众意见，不愿接受群众的监督，因而脱离群众。在这方面，我是深有体会的。在无产阶级革命派掌权初期，由于我在思想上滋长了“论造反我早，论资格我老，论水平我高”的骄傲情绪，对于来自群众的批评意见，不是热忱欢迎。过去和我在一起造反，现在又同在革委会一起工作的同志，出于关心和爱护，给我提过一些建议，我也曾以“不合口味”给顶了回去。这样无形中群众对我开始疏远了，有意见也不愿跟我讲了。后来，经过学习毛主席著作，深挖了“骄”字的根源，认识到骄傲自满的本质是个人主义，是资产阶级、小资产阶级思想。要克服“骄”字，就要斗私批修，破私立公，树立彻底的群众观点。
    参加革委会工作将近一年来的实践，使我深刻地体会到：“骄”是“变”的开始。有了“骄”字，毛主席指示学不进，群众意见听不进，既不能紧紧跟上，也不能紧紧靠下。如果不警惕，发展下去，必然会脱离群众，脱离毛泽东思想，重蹈党内一小撮走资派的覆辙。革委会的任何成员都只能是人民的勤务员，而决不能做官当老爷。因此，革委会的一切工作人员都必须把自己置于群众监督之下，热忱接受群众的监督。
    始终和群众打成一片  保持工人阶级的本色
    革命群众代表、市革委会常委林云喜说：毛主席教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。我原来是粮店售粮员，被选进革委会后，有时坐办公室，也经常外出开会、作报告。渐渐地，我同原来朝夕相处的同志接触少了。有一次我回粮店去，一进门看到买粮的人很多，就急忙上前帮助倒面袋子。谁知刚一伸手，一个同志赶紧拦住说：“别倒了，看整你一身面！”这句话，开始我没有怎么注意，后来仔细一想，不禁大吃一惊：我离开才几天，大家就对我不一样了，天长日久，不是就脱离群众了吗？我重温了毛主席关于“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，决心按照毛主席的教导去做。从此以后，我除了有时参加常委决定重大问题的会议以外，还象过去一样，同粮店的同志一起售粮、倒袋子。革命群众又和我亲近起来。后来，感到光是参加售粮劳动是不够的，作为革委会的一个领导成员，应当经常到群众中去，向他们宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的最新指示。于是，我在革委会的支持下，经常到基层生产单位和街道去，和工农群众一起劳动，一道学习毛泽东思想，并给群众演幻灯，进行阶级教育。这样经常深入群众，使我体会到，广大工农群众觉悟最高，对毛主席的阶级感情最深，最听毛主席的话。只有经常和群众在一起，当群众的小学生，向群众学习，才能永远保持无产阶级战士的本色，当好人民的勤务员。
    活学活用毛主席著作  抓住戒骄防变的根本
    革命群众代表、市革委会副主任陈荣玉说：我原来是个工人。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，在毛主席革命路线指引下，造了党内一小撮走资派的反。那时候，每学一段毛主席语录，都觉得非常亲切，都得到极大的鼓舞和力量。夺权以后，我被选入革委会工作。开始的时候，每天工作不论怎么晚，都坚持学习毛主席著作，并且对照自己当天的工作，检查哪件事情作对了，哪件事情作错了，找出第二天的工作方向和工作方法，然后再睡觉。那时候的工作虽然困难很多，但心明眼亮，不脱离群众，对毛主席的战略部署跟得比较紧。
    可是，经过一段工作之后，摸到了一些工作规律，压力减轻了，我竟一度放松了学习毛主席著作，对自己要求不严了，“骄”字就乘隙而入。从此，坐在办公室开会和处理事务的时间多了，到群众中去的时间少了，和群众谈话常以教育者的姿态出现，觉得自己比别人高明。后来，一位同志为了帮助我，选送给我四条毛主席语录。当时，我还很不理解，但冷静下来之后，用这四条毛主席语录一对照，发觉自己的思想和行动，都有些离开了毛主席的教导，主要是头脑中产生了骄傲情绪。我带着这个问题，重新学习了毛主席关于“我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务”的教导。我认识到骄傲情绪发展下去，就会使自己逐渐变成一个高高在上的官老爷，就会重新走党内一小撮走资派的老路，最终被革命人民所抛弃。经过查根找源，我认识到产生骄傲情绪，就是因为放松了活学活用毛主席著作。我更加深刻地体会到毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，一时一刻也离不开。从此，又抓紧了对毛主席著作的学习，坚持用毛主席的教导对照检查自己的思想和行动，工作情况就有了改进。我决心学一辈子毛主席著作，一辈子保持谦虚、谨慎的作风，和革命群众一起革命一辈子。
