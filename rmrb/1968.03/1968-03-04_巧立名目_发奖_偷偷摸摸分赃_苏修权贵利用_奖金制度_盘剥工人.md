		Cleverly Inventing Pretexts to "Award" Prizes, Secretly Dividing Spoils
		The Soviet Revisionist Privileged Class Uses the "Bonus System" to Exploit Workers

		New China News Agency, Moscow: In the Soviet Union, where the so-called "new system" of complete capitalist restoration is being implemented, the "bonus system" is being vigorously promoted in various enterprises and departments. A small clique of privileged elements, using "bonuses" as a pretext, engage in deception, embezzle public funds, and increase their exploitation of the working class.

		The Soviet revisionist leadership, in the so-called "Regulations on State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" issued in 1965, granted enterprise leaders the authority to determine bonuses at their discretion. Thus, a small clique of privileged elements use the so-called "bonus system" as a means to amass wealth. They invent all sorts of pretexts, awarding bonuses for everything, taking bonuses from everywhere. They stipulate that bonuses are distributed according to salary ratios, so the higher the salary of the new bourgeois elements, the more bonuses they receive. Some enterprise leaders receive bonuses that are 150 times more than the average worker; in some enterprises, although the number of leaders is small, the bonuses they take account for 60% of the total bonus amount, while the vast majority of ordinary workers receive only a meager amount of bonuses after completing harsh quotas, otherwise, their salaries are deducted.

		It is revealed that the leaders of a glass factory in Gomel received bonuses amounting to 147.2% of their salaries in one quarter, while the workers received nothing. The manager of an enterprise in Lipetsk cleverly received seven bonuses in one month, totaling 1,400 rubles. Some enterprise leaders, in order to receive bonuses, even falsely report "rationalization suggestions"; some list machines that cannot be matched as completed products; some even deliberately increase product costs in the previous month to reduce them in the next month, thereby receiving bonuses.

		The Soviet privileged class, in order to increase the exploitation of workers, put forward the slogan of "you contribute profits, so please accept the increase in your personal income," using the name of "increasing personal income" to deceive workers into creating more profits for them. However, sometimes the small amount of "bonuses" distributed to workers as window dressing is also taken by the privileged class within the factory. A worker in Sverdlovsk exposed the situation of bonus distribution in his factory, saying: "Sometimes this 'division of spoils' is done secretly."

		The Soviet privileged class, under the pretext of "improving people's material well-being" and "more pay for more work," is committing the evil act of increasing the exploitation of workers, which is arousing increasingly strong dissatisfaction among the broad masses of laboring people.

    巧立名目“发奖”　偷偷摸摸分赃
    苏修权贵利用“奖金制度”盘剥工人
    新华社讯　莫斯科消息：在施行彻底复辟资本主义的所谓“新体制”的苏联各个企业部门中，正在大力推广所谓的“奖金制度”。一小撮特权阶层以“奖金”为幌子，弄虚作假，大肥私囊，加重对工人阶级的剥削。
    苏修领导集团在一九六五年颁发的所谓“国营生产企业条例”给予企业领导人自订奖金的大权。于是，一小撮特权阶层把所谓“奖金制度”作为他们大发横财的手段。他们巧立名目，事事搞奖金，处处拿奖金。他们规定奖金是按工资比例发的，因此那些工资越高的新资产阶级分子，所得的奖金越多。有的企业领导人所得的奖金甚至高于一般工人的一百五十倍之多；有些企业的领导人，人数虽少但捞取的奖金竟占全部奖金额的百分之六十，而广大的普通工人要得到为数甚微的奖金却要完成苛刻的定额，否则还要扣除工资。
    据透露，戈米尔的一个玻璃厂的领导人员在一个季度中所捞取的奖金就占他们薪金额的百分之一四七·二，而广大工人却分文未得。利佩茨克一个企业的经理，一个月就巧妙地捞到七次奖金，共达一千四百卢布。有些企业领导人为了捞取奖金，甚至虚报“合理化建议”；有的把不能配套的机器列入完成的产品量；有的甚至故意在前一个月提高产品成本，以便在后一个月再降低它，从而捞到奖金。
    苏修特权阶层为了加重对工人的剥削，向工人提出了所谓“你交了利润，那么就请收下你的一份私人收入的增加”的口号，以“增加私人收入”为名，欺骗工人为他们创造更多的利润。但是，有时作为装潢门面而分给工人的一点数目极小的“奖金”也被工厂内的特权阶层分掉。斯维尔德洛夫斯克一位工人揭露他所在的工厂分配“奖金”的情况时就说：“有时这种‘分赃’是偷偷摸摸进行的。”
    苏联特权阶层在所谓“提高人民物质福利”、“多劳多得”的幌子下加重对工人剥削的罪恶行径，正在激起广大劳动人民越来越强烈的不满。
