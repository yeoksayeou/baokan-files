The revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards of Dongchang Middle School in Shanghai have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to launch a "people's war" against anarchism. Through this struggle, they have raised their class consciousness, strengthened their revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline, making the situation of resuming classes and making revolution better and better.

After the school's revolutionary committee was established in September last year, the work of resuming classes and making revolution proceeded smoothly. Later, however, some students, influenced by the anarchist trends in society, did not come to school regularly or would come for a short while and then leave. Faced with this situation, the broad revolutionary teachers and students were very anxious. The students of the Mao Zedong Thought study group in Class 2 (3) wrote a big-character poster fiercely attacking anarchism.

This poster aroused a strong response from the teachers and students. Some people did not understand why anarchism should be criticized, thinking that the current struggle's main direction is to study, criticize, and resume classes and make revolution, and that criticizing anarchism would interfere with the main direction of the struggle. Some even thought that this was directing the spearhead at the masses. In response to these active thoughts, the school revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the school. They organized revolutionary teachers and students to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles." Through study, everyone realized that criticizing anarchism is precisely to ensure the normal progress of studying, criticizing, and resuming classes and making revolution.

During the struggle against anarchism, the school revolutionary committee always grasped the class struggle as the key. On the one hand, they focused on educating through typical cases within the school, and on the other hand, they invited soldiers from the People's Liberation Army and relevant units to give reports in the school, introducing how class enemies in society use anarchist trends to corrupt young people. Many vivid facts aroused the revolutionary teachers and students' hatred towards the class enemies and deepened their understanding of the harmfulness of anarchism.

To thoroughly eliminate the influence of anarchist trends in thought, the school revolutionary committee also guided the teachers and students to fiercely struggle against the "self" and uproot the ideological roots of anarchism. Many classes held struggle-against-self meetings, thoroughly exposing the crimes of the "self," which effectively promoted ideological revolutionization. Everyone voluntarily abided by revolutionary discipline.

### 大反无政府主义　加强革命纪律性  上海东昌中学复课闹革命搞得好

    大反无政府主义　加强革命纪律性
    上海东昌中学复课闹革命搞得好
    据新华社上海一日电　上海市东昌中学革命师生和红卫兵小将，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，掀起了一场围剿无政府主义的“人民战争”，在斗争中提高了阶级觉悟，加强了革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，使复课闹革命的形势越来越好。
    这所学校在去年九月成立革命委员会以后，复课闹革命进行得很好。后来，有一部分学生由于受到社会上无政府主义思潮的影响，随便不到校上课，或者到校转一转就回家了。面对这种情况，广大革命师生非常焦急。初二（三）班毛泽东思想学习小组的同学，写出了一张向无政府主义猛烈开火的革命大字报。
    这张大字报引起了广大师生强烈的反响。有一些人对为什么要批判无政府主义不太理解，认为当前斗争大方向是大学习、大批判和复课闹革命，批判无政府主义会干扰斗争大方向；有的甚至认为这是把矛头指向群众。针对这些活思想，校革委会遵循毛主席关于“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，在全校大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，组织革命师生反复学习毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”。经过学习，大家认识到，批判无政府主义，正是为了保证大学习、大批判和复课闹革命的正常进行。
    在围剿无政府主义过程中，校革委会始终抓住阶级斗争这个纲。他们一方面抓住校内典型事例进行教育，同时邀请解放军和有关单位的同志来校作报告，介绍社会上的阶级敌人如何利用无政府主义思潮来腐蚀青少年。许多活生生的事实，激发了广大革命师生对阶级敌人的仇恨，加深了对无政府主义危害性的认识。
    为了从思想上肃清无政府主义思潮的影响，校革委会还引导师生狠斗“私”字，挖掉产生无政府主义的思想根源。许多班级召开斗私会，大摆“私”字的罪状，有力地促进了思想革命化，大家都自觉地遵守革命纪律。
