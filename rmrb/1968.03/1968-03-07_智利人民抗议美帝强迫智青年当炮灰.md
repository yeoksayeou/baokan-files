The Chilean people have expressed great indignation at the barbaric actions of U.S. imperialism in forcing Chilean youth to serve as cannon fodder in the U.S. invasion of Vietnam.

Recently, a 22-year-old Chilean youth named Daniel Alarcon, who resides in Los Angeles, was preparing to return to Chile. However, he received a notice from the U.S. military authorities stating that he would not receive a visa to return to Chile before February 20th, and that he was being forced to join the U.S. Marine Corps and sent to Vietnam to die.

This Chilean youth wrote a letter to his mother in Chile, expressing his determination to fight against this barbaric and violent act by the U.S. imperialists.

This incident has sparked strong protests among the people in Chile.

    智利人民抗议美帝强迫智青年当炮灰
    智利人民对美帝国主义野蛮地强迫智利青年充当美国侵略越南的炮灰，表示极大的愤慨。
    最近，有一个居住在美国洛杉矶的二十二岁的智利青年丹尼尔·阿拉尔孔要回智利去，但他接到了美国军事当局的通知，说他在二月二十日前得不到回智利的签证，并且硬要他参加美国海军陆战队，要把他送到越南去送死。
    这个智利青年给他在智利的母亲写了一封信，表示要同美帝国主义者的这一野蛮暴行作斗争。
    这件事在智利引起了人们的强烈抗议。
