Our great leader Chairman Mao has always taught us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "Without a correct political standpoint, it is as if one has no soul."

However, the Chinese Khrushchev openly opposes Chairman Mao. He spreads the fallacy of "good production equals good politics" everywhere, claiming that "technical work determines everything" and that "if one truly has a skill, a creation, an invention, regardless of other aspects, one can be a hero or a model." He wants to lead people down the wrong path of detaching from politics, focusing solely on technology and production. He proposes that as long as "production is good," one can be developed into a party member. This is his malicious plot to attempt to transform our party into a revisionist party, and we must resolutely refute him.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy." The Communist Party is the tool of the proletariat for class struggle. Therefore, to be a Communist Party member, one must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always emphasize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Only by placing politics in the first position can one become a vanguard fighter of the proletariat.

Communist Party members should certainly play a model and leading role in production struggles, diligently study their profession, and do a good job in production. However, production must be guided by politics; otherwise, one will lose direction and will not be able to truly succeed in socialist production. If we fall for the Chinese Khrushchev's tricks, focusing only on production and professional skills, neglecting class struggle and national affairs, in the face of the sharp and complex struggles between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, allowing the class enemy to stir up trouble, and not knowing what is happening when the country changes color, then what use is good production?

"Good production equals good politics"? This is nonsense! Many of our worker comrades are able to excel in production precisely because they study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using proletarian politics to guide their work and production. It is precisely because they uphold the proletarian class standpoint, have an immense love for socialism, and a deep hatred for the class enemy, establishing the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people, that they can dedicate all their strength to the cause of socialist construction. They enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," resolutely smash the class enemy's plot to sabotage production, resolutely oppose anarchism, and firmly guard their production posts. Some of our comrades, although they did not initially master the technology and their production was not very good, because they love the Party and Chairman Mao, always emphasize politics, have a clear direction, and are full of enthusiasm, they can quickly master the technology and become models of grasping revolution and promoting production. Countless facts show: only with good politics can there be good production.

On the contrary, there are also some people who, on the surface, seem to understand technology and have good production, but their starting point is personal fame and gain, it is the "self." Such people, when they feel that work is beneficial to their personal interests, can also work very hard; once work conflicts with their personal interests, they will become sullen, act arrogantly, and even throw up their hands and refuse to work, disregarding the interests of the state. There is also a small group of class enemies who, to deceive the masses, pretend to be active in production, appearing to do well, but at the slightest disturbance, they will stir up trouble, create chaos, and sabotage, revealing their hostile faces towards the Party and socialism. For such people, is "good production" not precisely to cover up their political corruption?

The "good production equals good politics" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, that as long as "production is good" and "has a skill," one can become a party member, is entirely business-first, technology-first, and letting individualism take the lead, letting bourgeois counter-revolutionary politics take the lead. If we follow the Chinese Khrushchev's standard to recruit party members, then those individualistic opportunists, those capitalists with "expert" labels, those counter-revolutionary two-faced people, as well as traitors and spies, will infiltrate the party. In this way, will the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China not be transformed by the likes of the Chinese Khrushchev into a "production party," becoming a bourgeois party, a revisionist party?

In the past, the fallacy of "good production equals good politics" propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev also had an influence in our factory. The factory's party organization rarely organized Communist Party members and worker comrades to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, did not educate party members to be vanguard fighters of class struggle, but instead spread the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, talking about how "emphasizing politics must be realized in production and professional work, otherwise it is empty." When developing party members, they emphasized production over politics, developing those with good production, and disregarding those with good politics but poor production. The factory once had a prevalent trend of "politics is a check, technology is cash," with some people mistakenly believing that whether a person is good politically is intangible and ungraspable; as long as one has technology, the leadership will appreciate it, one can be rated as excellent, and have the hope of joining the party. Therefore, some Communist Party members and young workers only focused on production and technology, detaching from politics and class struggle. As a result, in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the face of sharp and complex class struggles, they lost their direction, stood on the wrong side, and became tools for the Chinese Khrushchev to implement the bourgeois reactionary line. In this movement to thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line of building the party, these comrades, through their personal experiences, criticized and repudiated the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "good production equals good politics," and resolutely eliminated his reactionary influence.

We worker comrades must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, be both revolutionary pioneers and production models, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide production and guide everything, and strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    共产党员要做无产阶级的先锋战士
    ——驳“生产好就是政治好”的谬论
    上海电子管厂革命委员会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席一贯教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫却公然同毛主席唱反调。他到处散布“生产好就是政治好”的谬论，胡说什么“技术工作决定一切”，“如果真有一门本事，真有一种创造，真有一种发明，不管其他好不好，就可以是英雄或者模范”。他要把人们引上脱离政治、埋头搞技术、搞生产的歧途。他提出，只要“生产好”，就可以发展为党员。这是他妄图将我们党篡改为修正主义的党的恶毒阴谋，我们一定要坚决驳倒他。
    毛主席最近指示我们说：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”共产党就是无产阶级进行阶级斗争的工具，因此，做一个共产党员，首先一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。只有把政治摆在第一位，才能作一名无产阶级的先锋战士。
    共产党员当然应该在生产斗争中起模范带头作用，努力钻研业务，搞好生产。但是，搞生产一定要由政治来统帅，否则就会迷失方向，不可能真正搞好社会主义的生产。如果我们上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，只去埋头搞生产，埋头搞业务，把阶级斗争、国家大事统统抛在脑后，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线尖锐复杂的斗争的情况下，任凭阶级敌人兴风作浪，连国家变了颜色都不知道是怎么回事，那么，生产再好又有什么用呢？
      “生产好就是政治好”吗？这是胡说！我们许多工人同志，生产所以干得非常出色，就是因为他们活学活用毛主席著作，用无产阶级政治统帅业务，统帅生产。正是由于他们坚持无产阶级的阶级立场，对社会主义无比热爱，对阶级敌人异常痛恨，树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想，才能把自己的全部力量贡献给社会主义建设事业。他们热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，坚决粉碎阶级敌人妄图破坏生产的阴谋，坚决反对无政府主义，坚守生产岗位。我们有些同志，虽然开始工作时没有掌握技术，生产还不大好，但是因为他们热爱党，热爱毛主席，处处时时突出政治，方向明，干劲大，所以他们就能很快掌握技术，成为抓革命、促生产的模范。无数事实说明：只有政治好，才能生产好。
    相反，也有一些人，表面上看来，懂技术，生产好，但是，他们的出发点是个人的名和利，是“私”字。这样的人，当他觉得工作对他个人有利的时候，也可以干得很起劲；一旦工作和他的个人利益发生了矛盾，他就会闹情绪，耍态度，甚至甩手不干，置国家利益于不顾。更有一小撮阶级敌人，为了欺骗群众，平时在生产上伪装积极，表面上也可以干得很好，但一有风吹草动，他们就煽阴风、点鬼火，捣乱，破坏，敌视党、敌视社会主义的狰狞面目就暴露出来了。这样的人，“生产好”不恰恰正是为了掩盖他们的政治坏吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫所说的“生产好就是政治好”，只要“生产好”，“有一门本事”，就可以做党员，这完全是业务挂帅，技术挂帅，就是让个人主义挂帅，让资产阶级的反革命政治挂帅。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的这种标准去吸收党员，那就会让那些个人主义投机家，挂着“专家”招牌的资本家，反革命两面派，以及叛徒特务，钻入党内。这样，伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党，岂不要被中国赫鲁晓夫之流篡改成为“生产党”，变成资产阶级的党、修正主义的党吗？
    过去，中国赫鲁晓夫“生产好就是政治好”的谬论，在我们厂里也是有流毒的。厂里的党组织很少组织共产党员和工人同志活学活用毛主席著作，没有教育党员要做阶级斗争的先锋战士，而是散布中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论，讲什么“突出政治要落实到生产上，业务上，否则就是空的”。在发展党员时，偏重生产，不重政治，生产好的就培养发展，生产上过不得硬，政治再好也看不中。厂里曾一度流行“政治是支票，技术是现钞”的歪风，有些人错误地认为一个人政治上好不好，是摸不着、拿不到的；只要有了技术，领导看得上，就能评上五好，就有希望入党。因此，有些共产党员和青年工人，就只是埋头搞生产，钻技术，脱离政治，脱离阶级斗争。结果，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争面前，迷失了方向，站错了队，成为中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线的工具。在这次大学毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线的群众运动中，这些同志用他们自己的切身体会，斗私批修，纷纷起来愤怒揭发中国赫鲁晓夫“生产好就是政治好”的谬论，要坚决肃清他的反动影响。
    我们工人同志一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，既当革命的闯将，又当生产的模范，以毛泽东思想来统帅生产，统帅我们的一切，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而努力奋斗。
