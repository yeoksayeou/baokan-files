The revolutionary people of Algeria, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, deeply love and respect the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Chairman Mao. Currently, more and more Algerian workers, peasants, students, and cadres are studying Chairman Mao's works. Many people carry "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them and study it seriously.

Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought

An Algerian worker named Amar deeply respects the great leader Chairman Mao and loves reading his books. He said, "Chairman Mao is the Lenin of our time," "Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the whole world." He always carries a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in his pocket, and whenever he has time, he reads it, day or night. He once told his friends, "Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We workers must study Chairman Mao's works well. Chairman Mao's works are the invincible and powerful ideological weapons for the working class to wage struggle." Amar can now almost fluently recite the parts of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" about class and class struggle, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, daring to struggle and daring to win, people's war, etc.

One day, holding "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he pointed to a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall in front of his room and said to a Chinese friend with deep affection, "Chairman Mao is the great savior of all oppressed peoples in the world, the guide of the revolutionary people." Then, he said with great passion, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" while sick

One day, an Algerian youth named Kamidud visited a sick friend in the hospital. When Kamidud approached her bed, her first words were to ask Kamidud if he had brought the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" she wanted. When Kamidud handed her a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" he had obtained from a Chinese friend, she was so happy that she forgot her pain, tightly pressing the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to her chest, and excitedly said, "I have a copy of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao'!" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" From then on, she insisted on studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" while sick.

Wind and rain cannot stop reading Chairman Mao's books

One day, in a certain place in Algeria, it was windy and raining. A Chinese friend, while on the road, suddenly saw a young villager sitting under an olive tree, engrossed in reading a little red book, despite the wind and rain. Upon closer inspection, the young man was seriously reading the revolutionary treasure of the people of the world, "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The young man told the Chinese comrades, "Mao Zedong Thought has tremendous power. No matter how big the wind and rain, it cannot stop me from reading Chairman Mao's books!"

Reading the revolutionary red treasure every day

One day, in the southern part of Algeria, in the town of Djelfa, a firefighter covered in mud, with red eyes from continuous labor for four days and nights without sleep, should have been resting that night. However, upon seeing a Chinese friend, he couldn't even think about sleeping and insisted on talking with the Chinese friend.

He said, "I used to be an anti-French fighter and was injured seven times. We will never forget the great help of the great Chinese people led by the great leader Chairman Mao to the Algerian people." He also said, "During the anti-French war, we read Chairman Mao's books and fought according to Mao Zedong Thought, and we defeated the enemy. I am so eager to read Chairman Mao's books!" After receiving two Chairman Mao badges and a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he wore the Chairman Mao badges on his chest, raised the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and excitedly said, "This is the revolutionary red treasure. I will read it every day."

　　阿尔及利亚革命人民非常爱读毛主席的书
    毛泽东思想威力无穷
    据新华社阿尔及尔电  具有反帝斗争光荣传统的阿尔及利亚革命人民无限热爱、无限敬仰中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席。现在，学习毛主席著作的阿尔及利亚工人、农民、学生和干部越来越多了。许多人随身带着《毛主席语录》，认真学习。
    干革命靠毛泽东思想
    一位名叫阿马尔的阿尔及利亚工人非常敬仰伟大领袖毛主席，非常爱读毛主席的书。他说：“毛主席是当代的列宁”，“毛泽东思想照亮了全世界”。在他的衣服口袋里，总是装着一本《毛主席语录》，无论白天晚上，一有时间就看。他曾经对他的朋友说：“干革命靠毛泽东思想。我们工人必须好好学习毛主席著作，毛主席的著作是我们工人阶级进行斗争的战无不胜的强大的思想武器。”阿马尔现在几乎能流利地背诵《毛主席语录》中关于阶级和阶级斗争、帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎、敢于斗争，敢于胜利、人民战争等部分。
    一天，他拿着《毛主席语录》，指着他住室正面墙上挂着的一张毛主席像，无限深情地对一位中国朋友说：“毛主席是全世界被压迫人民的大救星，是革命人民的带路人。”然后，他又满怀激情地说：“祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！”
    病中坚持读《毛主席语录》
    一天，一位名叫卡米杜德的阿尔及利亚青年，到医院去探望一位生病的朋友。当卡米杜德走到她床前的时候，她的第一句话就问卡米杜德把她要的《毛主席语录》带来了没有。当卡米杜德把他从中国朋友那里要到的一本《毛主席语录》交给她时，她高兴得忘记了病痛，把红彤彤的《毛主席语录》紧紧地贴在胸前，激动地说：“我有一本《毛主席语录》了！”并欢呼“毛主席万岁！”从此，她在病中坚持学习《毛主席语录》。
    风雨阻挡不了读毛主席的书
    一天，阿尔及利亚某地刮着风，下着雨，正在赶路的中国朋友忽然在道旁的一棵橄榄树下发现一位放羊的农村青年，不顾风雨，坐在那里全神贯注地看一本小红书。他们走近一看，原来那位青年正在认真阅读全世界人民的革命宝书《毛主席语录》。这位青年对中国同志说：毛泽东思想有巨大的威力。风雨再大，也不能阻挡我读毛主席的书！
    天天要读革命红宝书
    有一天，在阿尔及利亚南方的杰尔法镇，一位全身沾满污泥、两眼通红的消防队员，连续劳动了四昼夜没有睡觉了，那天晚上本该他休息，可是他一见到中国朋友，觉也顾不得睡，一定要求和中国朋友谈谈。
    他说：“我过去是一名抗法战士，曾受过七次伤。我们永远忘不了伟大领袖毛主席领导的伟大中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的巨大帮助。”他又说：“在抗法战争中，我们就读过毛主席的书，按照毛泽东思想去战斗，就打败了敌人。我多么渴望读毛主席的书啊！”当他得到两枚毛主席像章和一本《毛主席语录》后，他将毛主席像章佩戴在胸前，高举《毛主席语录》，激动地说：“这是革命的红宝书，我要天天读。”
