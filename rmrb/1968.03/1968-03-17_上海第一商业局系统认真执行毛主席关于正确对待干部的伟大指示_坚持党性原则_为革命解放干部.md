Shanghai First Commercial Bureau System Seriously Implements Chairman Mao's Great Instructions on Correctly Handling Cadres
Upholds Party Principles for the Revolution to Liberate Cadres

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 16 - The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of the Shanghai First Commercial Bureau system have seriously implemented the great instructions of the great teacher Chairman Mao on correctly handling cadres. Through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, they have raised their understanding of the importance of liberating cadres, upheld proletarian party principles in the work of liberating cadres, and helped a large number of cadres stand up for the revolution. Now, in this commercial bureau's 27 purchasing and supply stations, specialized companies, directly affiliated stores, and one commercial accounting school, more than a thousand cadres have mostly stood up, and many have participated in the revolutionary three-in-one leadership teams at various levels. The entire system has achieved revolutionary three-in-one leadership.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Abandon erroneous views, and cadres will stand before you." The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of the Shanghai First Commercial Bureau system, after conducting a comprehensive investigation and analysis of the cadres in their system and units, believe that the majority of cadres are good or relatively good. Some cadres made serious mistakes by taking the wrong side in the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, but they have the resolve to correct their mistakes. They should be helped to correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line according to the principle of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient."

In the process of helping cadres stand up for the revolution, some active thoughts have emerged among the masses. The main issues are that some cadres have various shortcomings, making people feel dissatisfied and unideal. Some masses fear that once cadres are liberated, they will retaliate against them; others worry that cadres who dare to fight will be difficult to get along with once they are integrated. In response to this state of mind, the proletarian revolutionary factions of this system believe that to correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, the revolutionary masses must first arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, put revolutionary interests first, break away from personal interests, eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, discard personal biases, and never let personal feelings replace policy, personal grudges replace revolutionary principles, or personal and small group interests and status. To liberate cadres, one must first liberate one's own thoughts. In a word, it is to liberate cadres for the revolution.

To solve the various active thoughts in liberating cadres and raise the ideological awareness of cadres and the masses, the proletarian revolutionary factions of this bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-left personnel, have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, inviting revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to participate in the study. So far, the bureau's Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held six times, with more than a thousand revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres participating. The study classes organized by various units have been held as many as ten times. Through study and self-criticism, broad revolutionary workers have come to realize that whether or not to boldly liberate and use revolutionary cadres is a key to whether the proletarian revolutionary factions can wield power well and use power well. It is an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. To liberate cadres, one must stand on the standpoint of proletarian party principles, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, use the method of one divides into two, and conduct a comprehensive and historical analysis of cadres. One must look at the major issues, the essence, and the mainstream. For those cadres who should be liberated, they must be liberated resolutely.

The former deputy secretary of the Shanghai Petroleum and Coal Company's Party Committee made mistakes by executing the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the movement. However, with the help of revolutionary masses, he deeply examined his soul, seriously checked his mistakes, and bravely stood up to expose the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. At the same time, he actively sought out revolutionary masses he had persecuted in the early stages of the movement to rectify his mistakes. The company's revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "not only looking at a cadre's momentary actions but also at the cadre's entire history and all work," conducted a comprehensive investigation of this cadre's history, work, and attitude towards the masses. They unanimously agreed to liberate him first and invite him to participate in the revolutionary three-in-one leadership team, making him the first in command.

In the process of integrating cadres, the revolutionary workers of the Dongfanghong Department Store encountered another problem. The store had a deputy manager who had a good background, was young, had revolutionary enthusiasm, and could uphold principles. Revolutionary workers generally considered him a relatively good cadre. However, should he be allowed to participate in the revolutionary committee and take on leadership responsibilities? Some responsible individuals of the revolutionary mass organizations hesitated, fearing that this cadre would be "uncooperative" and difficult to work with. However, the majority of revolutionary comrades did not agree with this view. They believed that daring to uphold revolutionary principles and speak out, rather than being a yes-man, is precisely the kind of cadre the party needs. "The Communist Party's cadre policy should be based on whether one can resolutely execute the party's line, obey party discipline, have close ties with the masses, have independent work capabilities, be active and hardworking, and not seek personal gain. This is the line of 'selecting the best.'" The revolutionary workers of the Dongfanghong Department Store followed Chairman Mao's teaching to identify and evaluate cadres and decided to nominate him to take on responsible work in the department store's revolutionary committee.

The proletarian revolutionary factions of the Shanghai First Commercial Bureau system have adopted a serious criticism and warm help attitude towards cadres who have made mistakes, showing no leniency or indulgence towards their mistakes. Their main methods are: first, pushing cadres who have made mistakes to the forefront of mass struggles for tempering and testing, supporting cadres to "show their faces" in the struggle between the two lines; second, organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes to help cadres link their thoughts and actions, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and some even adopt the method of "one helping one" by revolutionary mass organizations' responsible individuals to help cadres correctly treat themselves and the masses, conducting class education and two-line struggle education for cadres; third, for some leading cadres, if the masses have many opinions about them, revolutionary mass organizations' help groups will, based on the different situations of the cadres, formulate specific measures to provide in-depth and detailed help; fourth, for the bureau's leading cadres, the proletarian revolutionary factions of the bureau and its affiliated units will jointly investigate, study, and systematically analyze, combining efforts from top to bottom, to help cadres recognize and correct their mistakes. This approach has formed a mass movement of helping cadres throughout the bureau system.

　　上海第一商业局系统认真执行毛主席关于正确对待干部的伟大指示
　　坚持党性原则　为革命解放干部
    新华社上海十六日电　上海市第一商业局系统的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，认真执行伟大导师毛主席关于正确地对待干部的伟大指示，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，提高了对解放干部的重要意义的认识，在解放干部工作中坚持无产阶级党性原则，帮助大批干部站出来革命。现在这个商业局所属的二十七个采购供应站、专业公司、直属商店和一个商业会计学校的一千多名干部，绝大多数已经站出来，有不少还参加了各级革命三结合的领导班子，全局系统已经实现了革命的三结合。
    毛主席教导我们：“丢掉错误的观点，干部就站在面前了。”上海市第一商业局系统的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，对本系统、本单位的干部进行了全面的调查、分析后认为，绝大多数干部是好的和比较好的。有些干部在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期站错了队，犯了比较严重的错误，但是他们有决心改正错误，应当按照“惩前毖后，治病救人”的原则，帮助他们改正错误，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    在帮助干部站出来革命的过程中，群众中间也出现了一些活思想，主要是看到干部存在着这样或那样的缺点，总感到不满意、不理想。对于在运动中受过批判的干部，有些群众怕解放出来以后，会对自己进行打击报复；对有些敢于斗争的干部，又担心结合进来以后不好相处等等。针对这种思想状况，这个系统的无产阶级革命派认为，要正确贯彻毛主席的干部政策，从革命群众方面说，首先要用毛泽东思想武装头脑，一切从革命利益出发，破私立公，打掉资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，扔掉私心杂念，决不能以感情代替政策，以个人恩怨代替革命原则，更不能计较个人和小团体的名利、地位。要解放干部，先要解放自己的思想。一句话，就是要为革命解放干部。
    为了解决解放干部中的各种活思想，提高干部和群众的思想觉悟，这个局的无产阶级革命派在人民解放军支左人员帮助下，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，组织革命群众和革命干部一起参加学习。到目前为止，全局的毛泽东思想学习班已经举办了六期，参加学习的革命群众和革命干部有一千多人。各单位自己办的毛泽东思想学习班，多的已办了十几期。通过学习和斗私批修，广大革命职工认识到，能不能大胆解放和使用革命干部，这是无产阶级革命派掌好权、用好权的一个关键，是忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。要解放干部，必须站在无产阶级党性的立场上，严格区别两类不同性质的矛盾，用一分为二的方法，对干部进行全面的、历史的分析，要看大节、看本质、看主流。对那些该解放的干部，要坚决解放。
    上海石油煤炭公司的原党委副书记，在运动初期执行过资产阶级反动路线，但是他在革命群众帮助下，狠触灵魂，认真检查了自己所犯的错误，并且勇敢地站起来揭发党内一小撮走资派的罪行，同时还主动找运动初期被他整过的革命群众检查错误。公司的革命群众按照毛主席“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”的教导，对这个干部的历史、工作和对群众的态度，作了全面的考察，一致同意把他首先解放出来，吸收他参加革命三结合的领导班子，并且当了第一把手。
    在结合干部的过程中，东方红百货商店的革命职工碰到了另一个问题。商店有一个副经理，出身好，年纪轻，有革命干劲，能坚持原则。革命职工都认为他是一个比较好的干部。但是要不要让他参加革委会担负领导工作呢？革命群众组织的个别负责人有点犹豫，他们担心这个干部“不听话”，工作难搞。但是大多数革命同志不同意这种看法，他们认为，敢于坚持革命原则，敢于说话，不是唯唯诺诺当“老好人”，恰恰是党所需要的革命干部。“共产党的干部政策，应是以能否坚决地执行党的路线，服从党的纪律，和群众有密切的联系，有独立的工作能力，积极肯干，不谋私利为标准，这就是‘任人唯贤’的路线。”东方红百货商店的革命职工遵照毛主席的这一教导来识别干部，衡量干部，决定推选他担任商店革命委员会的负责工作。
    上海市第一商业局系统的无产阶级革命派，对犯过错误的干部采取既严肃批判，又热情帮助的态度，对他们的错误丝毫不姑息迁就。他们的主要作法是：一、把犯错误的干部推到群众斗争第一线去经受锻炼和考验，支持干部在两条路线斗争中“亮相”；二、举办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助干部联系自己的思想行动，活学活用毛主席的最新指示，有的还采取革命群众组织负责人同干部“一帮一”的办法，帮助干部正确对待自己，正确对待群众，对干部进行阶级教育和两条路线斗争的教育；三、有些领导干部，群众对他们意见比较多，就由革命群众组织帮助小组，根据干部的不同情况，订出具体措施，对症下药地进行深入细致的帮助；四、对局的领导干部，由局机关和局所属单位的无产阶级革命派一道调查研究、系统分析，上下结合，帮助干部认识和改正错误。这样做的结果，使全局系统形成了一个群众性帮助干部的热潮。
