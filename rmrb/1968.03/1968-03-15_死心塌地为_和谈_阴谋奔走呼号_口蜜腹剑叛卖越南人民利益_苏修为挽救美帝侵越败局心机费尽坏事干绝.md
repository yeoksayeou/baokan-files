	Recently, the Soviet revisionist leadership has become increasingly close with the U.S. imperialists, vigorously promoting the Johnson administration's "peace talks" deception, attempting to trick the Vietnamese people into laying down their arms amidst the victory songs of their anti-American, national salvation war and surrendering to the American aggressors. Their despicable actions of betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people and loyally serving the U.S. policy of invading Vietnam have reached an even more shameless level after the great victories of the South Vietnamese people this New Year.

	The U.S. imperialists have long used a counter-revolutionary strategy of war and peace against the Vietnamese people. Especially in the past half year, due to their increasing defeats on the Vietnamese battlefield and the growing criticism of their Vietnam policy at home, the U.S. imperialists, while planning further escalation of the war, have become even more closely coordinated with the Soviet revisionist clique and other reactionaries, frantically pushing the new "peace talks" conspiracy.

	The U.S. "Peace Talks" Wind

	The recent "peace talks" wind in the U.S. was started by U.S. President Johnson in his speech on September 29, 1967, in San Antonio, Texas. In this speech, Johnson threatened the heroic Vietnamese people with war while also offering an olive branch, proposing the so-called "San Antonio (peace talks) plan," raising the banner of "leading to fruitful discussions," and using more cunning tactics to reapply the tricks of "bombing to force talks" and "stopping bombing to deceive into talks." Under Johnson's direction, various "peace talks" brokers in Washington, from British Prime Minister Wilson to UN Secretary-General U Thant, from the Pope to Japanese Foreign Minister Takeo Miki, from Yugoslav traitor Tito to Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, all took the stage to perform. As the main "peace talks" broker and the number one accomplice of the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionist leadership, due to the continuous exposure by the revolutionary people of the world, had to hide in the dark corners for a period before September 1967 to promote the U.S. "peace talks" deception. After Johnson threw out the "San Antonio plan," this group of traitors eagerly returned to the stage, actively promoting the Washington "peace talks" deception, offering strategies and tactics.

	As soon as the U.S. "San Antonio plan" was unveiled, the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique further coordinated with the U.S. imperialists on the international stage, eagerly creating an atmosphere for U.S.-Soviet "cooperation" on the Vietnamese issue, encouraging Washington to more brazenly engage in war blackmail and play "peace talks" tricks in Vietnam. On one hand, they continued to engage in "d√©tente" with the U.S. in Europe, jointly maintaining the imperialist, revisionist counter-revolutionary "order" in Europe, allowing the U.S. to gradually withdraw troops from Western Europe to strengthen the war in Vietnam. On the other hand, they closely coordinated with the U.S.'s war escalation actions, frantically hyping the "terror" of the Vietnamese war, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to submit to the tyranny of the American aggressors and accept "peace talks." At the same time, they rushed to reach new compromises with the U.S. imperialists on the issue of "preventing nuclear proliferation," jointly proposing a draft treaty on "preventing nuclear proliferation" with Washington in August 1967, followed by a comprehensive draft of the treaty in January 1968, creating public opinion for U.S.-Soviet "reconciliation" and creating conditions for the U.S.-Soviet joint promotion of the "peace talks" deception in Vietnam.

	After Johnson stirred up this "peace talks" wind from San Antonio, the Soviet revisionist traitors immediately colluded with the U.S. imperialists, actively promoting the U.S. "peace talks" new conspiracy in various aspects. From September to December 1967, during the 22nd session of the United Nations General Assembly and the subsequent Security Council meetings, the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists closely coordinated, repeatedly plotting for the United Nations and the Security Council to intervene in the Vietnamese issue. U.S. representative Arthur Goldberg sang the old "peace talks" tune at the General Assembly, shouting hoarsely about "political solutions," "gradual reduction," and "reopening the Geneva Conference," etc. The next day, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko hurriedly stood up to support him, talking at length about the so-called "danger" of the Vietnamese issue, creating public opinion to promote the "peace talks" deception. At the end of November 1967, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a resolution, urging the U.S. government to find a way to let the Security Council "discuss" the Vietnamese issue. At this time, the Soviet revisionists more frequently conspired with the U.S. imperialists and, through so-called "diplomats" of the United Nations, leaked that they "would not oppose (the Security Council) discussing the Vietnamese issue."

	Johnson Takes the Lead, Kosygin Runs Around

	The shameful failure of this farce jointly staged by the Soviet revisionists and the U.S. imperialists to let the United Nations intervene in the Vietnamese issue and create a "peace talks" deception was followed by Johnson personally rushing to Asia and Europe at the end of December, secretly discussing the Vietnamese issue with a group of U.S. lackeys and "peace talks" propagandists, including the Pope, to plot new "peace talks" tricks. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique also took active action this time, coordinating with them. On December 19, Kosygin had a long discussion with U.S. Michigan Governor George Romney, who was preparing to run for the Republican presidential nomination, on the Vietnamese issue in Moscow. Subsequently, under the remote control and personal guidance of Washington, Kosygin also jointly launched a very blatant "peace talks" conspiracy activity with British Prime Minister Harold Wilson in early January this year. In this activity, the Soviet and British leaders sent their own deputy prime ministers and foreign ministers to Tokyo to secretly conspire with the Japanese Sato government, while personally holding tense discussions on the Vietnamese issue in Moscow. During the discussion, Kosygin learned from Wilson the "exact and latest situation" of "American thoughts on Vietnam," and in turn, he informed Wilson of the Soviet revisionists' attitude towards the Vietnamese issue. Both sides emphasized the "urgency" of "politically solving" the Vietnamese issue and expressed their determination to "jointly or separately do everything possible" to achieve this goal. Wilson later repeatedly boasted that the "bridge" to "Vietnamese peace" had been "greatly shortened" compared to before; in arranging "peace talks," the "distance" between Johnson and Kosygin was "relatively small," etc.

	After this backstage plotting, Kosygin and Wilson, these two big accomplices of the U.S. imperialists, again went abroad to promote the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary conspiracy: Kosygin rushed to New Delhi at the end of January to collude with Indira Gandhi and Tito; Wilson rushed to Washington in mid-February to report to Johnson the situation and results of his conspiracy with the Soviet revisionist leaders.

	During this period, Brezhnev and Kosygin personally spoke to foreign journalists, advocating "stopping bombing and talking." According to a report by the U.S. magazine "Life," Kosygin, in a conversation with American journalists on January 19, showed that he was "very serious" about "ending (the Vietnamese war)."

	The U.S. Is More Defeated, the Soviet Revisionists Serve More Eagerly

	Since the New Year, the military and civilians in South Vietnam have launched a comprehensive offensive on all fronts, inflicting unprecedented heavy blows on the American aggressors and their lackeys, achieving stunning results that shocked the world. The Soviet revisionist leadership was taken aback and anxious, and in the past month, they couldn't bother to cover up, openly jumping out to give advice to their dazed and confused Washington masters, actively serving them, pushing their betrayal activities on the Vietnamese issue to a new high.

	Just as the revolutionary people of the world were enthusiastically celebrating the great victories of the South Vietnamese people in the New Year, the Soviet revisionist leadership launched an unprecedentedly fervent campaign to promote "peace talks" in Vietnam.

	These propaganda efforts focused on the so-called "Vietnamese peace talks" and the U.S. imperialists' "rationality," while completely ignoring the firm determination of the South Vietnamese military and civilians to continue fighting on the basis of their victories, defeat the U.S. imperialists, and achieve a complete victory. They shouted and screamed against the so-called "military solution" to the Vietnamese issue, advocating "political solution" and "stopping bombing and talking," propagating that "negotiations are possible," as long as "the U.S. stops bombing, it can lead to peaceful talks on the Vietnamese issue," etc., frantically creating an atmosphere for "peace talks." The Soviet revisionist leadership also used their propaganda machines to exaggerate the "great sacrifices, damages, and material losses" caused by the bombing of U.S. bandit planes on North Vietnam. The "Red Star" newspaper on February 6 even used the words of a British bourgeois newspaper to propagandize that "due to new failures, Washington may 'lose its mind and further expand the war.'" These propaganda efforts, on the surface, criticized the U.S., but in reality, they attempted to use this to intimidate the Vietnamese people who were fighting stronger and stronger.

	The Soviet revisionist clique also repeatedly advised the Johnson administration through their newspapers and news agencies to "listen to the voice of reason," "seize the opportunity," and decide to "utilize" the current "possibility of getting out of the (Vietnamese war) dead end," "stop bombing and talk."

	The Soviet revisionists' pressure and temptation towards the Vietnamese people, and their persuasion and advice to Washington, vividly revealed a traitor's and accomplice's ugly face.

	At the same time, the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, after the great victories of the South Vietnamese military and civilians in the New Year, also greatly intensified their plotting of "peace talks" evil activities.

	On February 6, Kosygin met with U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Llewellyn Thompson in Moscow for a secret discussion. Three days later, on February 9, the Soviet revisionist clique authorized Tass to issue a statement, officially advocating "stopping bombing and talking."

	From February 11 to 12, the Soviet revisionists invited U Thant, who was then running around the world serving the U.S. "peace talks" deception, to visit Moscow, where they discussed with him the "prospects for Vietnamese peace." It was revealed that during the discussion, the Soviet revisionist leaders "assured U Thant that they were willing to help promote peace talks as much as possible."

	On February 14 and 16, Kosygin and Brezhnev delivered speeches in Minsk and Leningrad, respectively, advocating that the Vietnamese issue "cannot be solved by military means" but should "take the path of political solution," emphasizing the need to quickly "stop bombing and talk" in Vietnam. Their performance of this farce was completely in tune with U Thant's statement on February 24 at the United Nations on the results of his recent running around for Vietnamese "peace talks."

	During this period, the Soviet revisionists also extended their tentacles abroad, launching intense activities. In Washington, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., who had just returned to his post with the Soviet revisionists' secret instructions, held two consecutive meetings with U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk within 24 hours on February 15 and 16 to secretly discuss the Vietnamese issue. In London, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain met with British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had just returned from the U.S., to "detailed" convey the "current U.S. attitude towards the Vietnamese issue." In Paris, the Soviet Ambassador to France met with French President Charles de Gaulle on February 20 to inform him of the Soviet revisionists' "attitude towards the development of the Vietnamese situation" and to "exchange information and consult" on the Vietnamese issue.

	The U.S. Defeat Is Inevitable, the Soviet Revisionists Cannot Escape Punishment

	On one hand, blatantly creating public opinion for "peace talks," on the other hand, tensely plotting "peace talks" activities, this clearly shows that the gang of traitors and scoundrels in the Kremlin, in order to pull the U.S. imperialists out of the dead end of the Vietnam war and realize Washington's "peace talks" conspiracy, have reached an extremely anxious and eager level.

	The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Friends have true and false, but through practice, one can see who is a true friend and who is a false friend." The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique has long played counter-revolutionary two-faced tricks, blowing and shouting, desperately trying to disguise themselves as friends of the Vietnamese people. However, their actions of destroying the Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation war in the past few years, especially in the past half year, and their loyal service to the U.S. imperialists, have thoroughly exposed their true colors. Their "support" for the Vietnamese people is false, and their betrayal is true; their anti-American stance is false, and their stance of surrendering to and colluding with the Americans is true.

	The defeat of the U.S. imperialists' Vietnam war is inevitable, and the despicable Soviet revisionist traitors who shamelessly betray the interests of the Vietnamese people will also inevitably escape historical punishment. The heroic Vietnamese people will surely break through all difficulties and obstacles, continue the anti-American, national salvation war, and fight until they achieve final victory.
