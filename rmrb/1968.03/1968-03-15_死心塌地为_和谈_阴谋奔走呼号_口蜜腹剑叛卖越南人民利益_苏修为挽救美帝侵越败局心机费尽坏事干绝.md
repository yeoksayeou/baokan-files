	Recently, the Soviet revisionist leadership has become increasingly close with the U.S. imperialists, vigorously promoting the Johnson administration's "peace talks" deception, attempting to trick the Vietnamese people into laying down their arms amidst the victory songs of their anti-American, national salvation war and surrendering to the American aggressors. Their despicable actions of betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people and loyally serving the U.S. policy of invading Vietnam have reached an even more shameless level after the great victories of the South Vietnamese people this New Year.

	The U.S. imperialists have long used a counter-revolutionary strategy of war and peace against the Vietnamese people. Especially in the past half year, due to their increasing defeats on the Vietnamese battlefield and the growing criticism of their Vietnam policy at home, the U.S. imperialists, while planning further escalation of the war, have become even more closely coordinated with the Soviet revisionist clique and other reactionaries, frantically pushing the new "peace talks" conspiracy.

	The U.S. "Peace Talks" Wind

	The recent "peace talks" wind in the U.S. was started by U.S. President Johnson in his speech on September 29, 1967, in San Antonio, Texas. In this speech, Johnson threatened the heroic Vietnamese people with war while also offering an olive branch, proposing the so-called "San Antonio (peace talks) plan," raising the banner of "leading to fruitful discussions," and using more cunning tactics to reapply the tricks of "bombing to force talks" and "stopping bombing to deceive into talks." Under Johnson's direction, various "peace talks" brokers in Washington, from British Prime Minister Wilson to UN Secretary-General U Thant, from the Pope to Japanese Foreign Minister Takeo Miki, from Yugoslav traitor Tito to Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, all took the stage to perform. As the main "peace talks" broker and the number one accomplice of the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionist leadership, due to the continuous exposure by the revolutionary people of the world, had to hide in the dark corners for a period before September 1967 to promote the U.S. "peace talks" deception. After Johnson threw out the "San Antonio plan," this group of traitors eagerly returned to the stage, actively promoting the Washington "peace talks" deception, offering strategies and tactics.

	As soon as the U.S. "San Antonio plan" was unveiled, the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique further coordinated with the U.S. imperialists on the international stage, eagerly creating an atmosphere for U.S.-Soviet "cooperation" on the Vietnamese issue, encouraging Washington to more brazenly engage in war blackmail and play "peace talks" tricks in Vietnam. On one hand, they continued to engage in "détente" with the U.S. in Europe, jointly maintaining the imperialist, revisionist counter-revolutionary "order" in Europe, allowing the U.S. to gradually withdraw troops from Western Europe to strengthen the war in Vietnam. On the other hand, they closely coordinated with the U.S.'s war escalation actions, frantically hyping the "terror" of the Vietnamese war, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to submit to the tyranny of the American aggressors and accept "peace talks." At the same time, they rushed to reach new compromises with the U.S. imperialists on the issue of "preventing nuclear proliferation," jointly proposing a draft treaty on "preventing nuclear proliferation" with Washington in August 1967, followed by a comprehensive draft of the treaty in January 1968, creating public opinion for U.S.-Soviet "reconciliation" and creating conditions for the U.S.-Soviet joint promotion of the "peace talks" deception in Vietnam.

	After Johnson stirred up this "peace talks" wind from San Antonio, the Soviet revisionist traitors immediately colluded with the U.S. imperialists, actively promoting the U.S. "peace talks" new conspiracy in various aspects. From September to December 1967, during the 22nd session of the United Nations General Assembly and the subsequent Security Council meetings, the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists closely coordinated, repeatedly plotting for the United Nations and the Security Council to intervene in the Vietnamese issue. U.S. representative Arthur Goldberg sang the old "peace talks" tune at the General Assembly, shouting hoarsely about "political solutions," "gradual reduction," and "reopening the Geneva Conference," etc. The next day, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko hurriedly stood up to support him, talking at length about the so-called "danger" of the Vietnamese issue, creating public opinion to promote the "peace talks" deception. At the end of November 1967, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a resolution, urging the U.S. government to find a way to let the Security Council "discuss" the Vietnamese issue. At this time, the Soviet revisionists more frequently conspired with the U.S. imperialists and, through so-called "diplomats" of the United Nations, leaked that they "would not oppose (the Security Council) discussing the Vietnamese issue."

	Johnson Takes the Lead, Kosygin Runs Around

	The shameful failure of this farce jointly staged by the Soviet revisionists and the U.S. imperialists to let the United Nations intervene in the Vietnamese issue and create a "peace talks" deception was followed by Johnson personally rushing to Asia and Europe at the end of December, secretly discussing the Vietnamese issue with a group of U.S. lackeys and "peace talks" propagandists, including the Pope, to plot new "peace talks" tricks. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique also took active action this time, coordinating with them. On December 19, Kosygin had a long discussion with U.S. Michigan Governor George Romney, who was preparing to run for the Republican presidential nomination, on the Vietnamese issue in Moscow. Subsequently, under the remote control and personal guidance of Washington, Kosygin also jointly launched a very blatant "peace talks" conspiracy activity with British Prime Minister Harold Wilson in early January this year. In this activity, the Soviet and British leaders sent their own deputy prime ministers and foreign ministers to Tokyo to secretly conspire with the Japanese Sato government, while personally holding tense discussions on the Vietnamese issue in Moscow. During the discussion, Kosygin learned from Wilson the "exact and latest situation" of "American thoughts on Vietnam," and in turn, he informed Wilson of the Soviet revisionists' attitude towards the Vietnamese issue. Both sides emphasized the "urgency" of "politically solving" the Vietnamese issue and expressed their determination to "jointly or separately do everything possible" to achieve this goal. Wilson later repeatedly boasted that the "bridge" to "Vietnamese peace" had been "greatly shortened" compared to before; in arranging "peace talks," the "distance" between Johnson and Kosygin was "relatively small," etc.

	After this backstage plotting, Kosygin and Wilson, these two big accomplices of the U.S. imperialists, again went abroad to promote the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary conspiracy: Kosygin rushed to New Delhi at the end of January to collude with Indira Gandhi and Tito; Wilson rushed to Washington in mid-February to report to Johnson the situation and results of his conspiracy with the Soviet revisionist leaders.

	During this period, Brezhnev and Kosygin personally spoke to foreign journalists, advocating "stopping bombing and talking." According to a report by the U.S. magazine "Life," Kosygin, in a conversation with American journalists on January 19, showed that he was "very serious" about "ending (the Vietnamese war)."

	The U.S. Is More Defeated, the Soviet Revisionists Serve More Eagerly

	Since the New Year, the military and civilians in South Vietnam have launched a comprehensive offensive on all fronts, inflicting unprecedented heavy blows on the American aggressors and their lackeys, achieving stunning results that shocked the world. The Soviet revisionist leadership was taken aback and anxious, and in the past month, they couldn't bother to cover up, openly jumping out to give advice to their dazed and confused Washington masters, actively serving them, pushing their betrayal activities on the Vietnamese issue to a new high.

	Just as the revolutionary people of the world were enthusiastically celebrating the great victories of the South Vietnamese people in the New Year, the Soviet revisionist leadership launched an unprecedentedly fervent campaign to promote "peace talks" in Vietnam.

	These propaganda efforts focused on the so-called "Vietnamese peace talks" and the U.S. imperialists' "rationality," while completely ignoring the firm determination of the South Vietnamese military and civilians to continue fighting on the basis of their victories, defeat the U.S. imperialists, and achieve a complete victory. They shouted and screamed against the so-called "military solution" to the Vietnamese issue, advocating "political solution" and "stopping bombing and talking," propagating that "negotiations are possible," as long as "the U.S. stops bombing, it can lead to peaceful talks on the Vietnamese issue," etc., frantically creating an atmosphere for "peace talks." The Soviet revisionist leadership also used their propaganda machines to exaggerate the "great sacrifices, damages, and material losses" caused by the bombing of U.S. bandit planes on North Vietnam. The "Red Star" newspaper on February 6 even used the words of a British bourgeois newspaper to propagandize that "due to new failures, Washington may 'lose its mind and further expand the war.'" These propaganda efforts, on the surface, criticized the U.S., but in reality, they attempted to use this to intimidate the Vietnamese people who were fighting stronger and stronger.

	The Soviet revisionist clique also repeatedly advised the Johnson administration through their newspapers and news agencies to "listen to the voice of reason," "seize the opportunity," and decide to "utilize" the current "possibility of getting out of the (Vietnamese war) dead end," "stop bombing and talk."

	The Soviet revisionists' pressure and temptation towards the Vietnamese people, and their persuasion and advice to Washington, vividly revealed a traitor's and accomplice's ugly face.

	At the same time, the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, after the great victories of the South Vietnamese military and civilians in the New Year, also greatly intensified their plotting of "peace talks" evil activities.

	On February 6, Kosygin met with U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Llewellyn Thompson in Moscow for a secret discussion. Three days later, on February 9, the Soviet revisionist clique authorized Tass to issue a statement, officially advocating "stopping bombing and talking."

	From February 11 to 12, the Soviet revisionists invited U Thant, who was then running around the world serving the U.S. "peace talks" deception, to visit Moscow, where they discussed with him the "prospects for Vietnamese peace." It was revealed that during the discussion, the Soviet revisionist leaders "assured U Thant that they were willing to help promote peace talks as much as possible."

	On February 14 and 16, Kosygin and Brezhnev delivered speeches in Minsk and Leningrad, respectively, advocating that the Vietnamese issue "cannot be solved by military means" but should "take the path of political solution," emphasizing the need to quickly "stop bombing and talk" in Vietnam. Their performance of this farce was completely in tune with U Thant's statement on February 24 at the United Nations on the results of his recent running around for Vietnamese "peace talks."

	During this period, the Soviet revisionists also extended their tentacles abroad, launching intense activities. In Washington, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., who had just returned to his post with the Soviet revisionists' secret instructions, held two consecutive meetings with U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk within 24 hours on February 15 and 16 to secretly discuss the Vietnamese issue. In London, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain met with British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had just returned from the U.S., to "detailed" convey the "current U.S. attitude towards the Vietnamese issue." In Paris, the Soviet Ambassador to France met with French President Charles de Gaulle on February 20 to inform him of the Soviet revisionists' "attitude towards the development of the Vietnamese situation" and to "exchange information and consult" on the Vietnamese issue.

	The U.S. Defeat Is Inevitable, the Soviet Revisionists Cannot Escape Punishment

	On one hand, blatantly creating public opinion for "peace talks," on the other hand, tensely plotting "peace talks" activities, this clearly shows that the gang of traitors and scoundrels in the Kremlin, in order to pull the U.S. imperialists out of the dead end of the Vietnam war and realize Washington's "peace talks" conspiracy, have reached an extremely anxious and eager level.

	The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Friends have true and false, but through practice, one can see who is a true friend and who is a false friend." The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique has long played counter-revolutionary two-faced tricks, blowing and shouting, desperately trying to disguise themselves as friends of the Vietnamese people. However, their actions of destroying the Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation war in the past few years, especially in the past half year, and their loyal service to the U.S. imperialists, have thoroughly exposed their true colors. Their "support" for the Vietnamese people is false, and their betrayal is true; their anti-American stance is false, and their stance of surrendering to and colluding with the Americans is true.

	The defeat of the U.S. imperialists' Vietnam war is inevitable, and the despicable Soviet revisionist traitors who shamelessly betray the interests of the Vietnamese people will also inevitably escape historical punishment. The heroic Vietnamese people will surely break through all difficulties and obstacles, continue the anti-American, national salvation war, and fight until they achieve final victory.

　　死心塌地为“和谈”阴谋奔走呼号　口蜜腹剑叛卖越南人民利益
　　苏修为挽救美帝侵越败局心机费尽坏事干绝
    据新华社十四日讯　本社记者报道：最近半年来苏修领导集团越来越紧密地同美帝配合，大力推销约翰逊政府的“和谈”骗局，妄图诱迫越南人民在抗美救国战争节节胜利的凯歌声中放下武器，向美国侵略者屈膝投降。他们这种叛卖越南人民利益、忠心耿耿地为美国侵越政策效劳的卑劣行径，在越南南方人民今年新春大捷以后，发展到了更加无耻的程度。
    美帝国主义长时期以来一直对越南人民使用反革命的战、“和”两手策略。特别是最近半年来，由于在越南战场上越败越惨，侵越政策在国内遭到越来越强烈的抨击，美帝在策划进一步战争“升级”的同时，就更加紧密地同苏修集团和其他反动派串通一气，猖狂地推行“和谈”新阴谋。
    美帝大煽妖风　苏修积极响应
    美国近半年来的“和谈”新妖风，是由美帝头子约翰逊在去年九月二十九日在美国圣安东尼奥的一次讲话中开始煽起来的。在这次讲话中，约翰逊一面对英勇抗战的越南人民进行战争讹诈，一面大摇橄榄枝，提出所谓“圣安东尼奥（和谈）方案”，打出“导致有成果的讨论”的旗号，以更加诡诈的手法，向越南人民重施“停炸诱和”、“以炸迫和”的诡计。在约翰逊一手策划和导演之下，华盛顿的形形色色的“和谈”掮客们，从英国首相威尔逊到联合国秘书长吴丹，从梵蒂冈教皇到日本外相三木武夫，从南斯拉夫大叛徒铁托到印度总理英迪拉·甘地等，纷纷登台表演。作为美帝主要“和谈”掮客和头号帮凶的苏修领导集团，在去年九月以前由于全世界革命人民的不断揭露，有一个时期在推销美国“和谈”骗局方面被迫隐藏在阴暗的角落活动。在约翰逊抛出“圣安东尼奥方案”后，这帮叛徒就迫不及待地再次走上前台，为华盛顿的“和谈”骗局奔走呼号，出谋划策。
    美国“圣安东尼奥方案”一出笼，勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团就进一步在国际范围内同美帝大做交易，竭力为美苏在越南问题上的“合作”制造气氛，鼓励华盛顿更加放手地在越南进行战争讹诈和玩弄“和谈”诡计。一方面，他们继续在欧洲同美国大搞“缓和”，共同维护帝国主义、修正主义在欧洲的反革命“秩序”，使美国能够陆续从西欧抽调兵力，来强化侵越战争。另一方面，他们紧密配合美国的战争“升级”行动，拚命渲染越南战争的“恐怖”，妄图压越南人民屈服于美国侵略者的淫威之下，接受“和谈”。与此同时，他们在“防止核扩散”问题上急急忙忙地同美帝达成新的妥协，在去年八月同华盛顿共同提出“防止核扩散”条约草案以后，接着又在今年一月抛出条约的全面草案，大造美苏“和解”舆论，并为美苏合伙在越南推行“和谈”骗局创造条件。
    在约翰逊从圣安东尼奥煽起这股“和谈”妖风之后，苏修叛徒们立即和美帝勾结起来，在各方面大肆展开兜售美国“和谈”新阴谋的活动。从去年九月到十二月，在第二十二届联合国大会和后来安理会开会期间，美帝和苏修密切配合，多次策划由联合国和安理会插手干预越南问题。美国代表戈德堡在大会上大唱“和谈”老调，声嘶力竭地叫嚷什么“政治解决”、“逐步降级”，以及“重开日内瓦会议”等等。苏修外交部长葛罗米柯第二天就连忙站出来帮腔，大谈特谈越南问题的所谓“危险”，为推行“和谈”骗局制造舆论。去年十一月底，美国参议院外交委员会通过决议，要求美国政府设法让安理会“讨论”越南问题。这时，苏修更加频繁地同美帝密谋，并且通过联合国所谓“外交人士”透风说，他们“不会反对（安理会）讨论越南问题”。
    约翰逊亲自出马　柯西金四处奔走
    苏修同美帝联合串演的这场企图让联合国干预越南问题、制造“和谈”骗局的丑剧，遭到了可耻的破产。紧接着，约翰逊在十二月下旬亲自跑到亚洲和欧洲，同包括梵蒂冈教皇在内的一批美帝走卒和“和谈”吹鼓手就越南问题进行密商，策划“和谈”的新花招。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团这一次也积极行动起来，与之配合。十二月十九日，柯西金在莫斯科同准备竞选共和党总统候选人的美国密执安州州长罗姆尼就越南问题进行了长时间的会谈。接着，在华盛顿遥控和一手牵线之下，柯西金又在今年一月下旬同英国首相威尔逊共同展开了极为露骨的“和谈”阴谋活动。在这一活动中，苏英头目一面分别派出自己的部长会议副主席和外交大臣到东京同日本佐藤政府密谋，一面亲自在莫斯科就越南问题进行了紧张的会谈。会谈中，柯西金从威尔逊那里了解了“美国关于越南的想法的确切和最新的情况”，又把苏修关于越南问题的态度向威尔逊交了底。双方一致强调“政治解决”越南问题的“迫切性”，并表示“决心共同地或者分别地为达到这一目的而尽其一切所能”。威尔逊事后一再得意忘形地宣称，通向“越南和平”的“桥梁”比以前已经“大大缩短了”；在安排“和谈”方面，约翰逊和柯西金之间的“距离比较小”等等。
    经过这番幕后策划，柯西金和威尔逊这两名美帝大帮凶，又为推销美帝的反革命阴谋出国奔走：柯西金在一月底跑到新德里，同英迪拉·甘地和铁托进行勾搭；威尔逊则在二月中旬赶往华盛顿，向约翰逊汇报他同苏修头目密谋的情况和结果。
    在这前后，勃列日涅夫、柯西金还亲自出面，对外国记者发表谈话，鼓吹“停炸和谈”。据美国《生活》杂志报道，柯西金一月十九日在对美国记者的一次谈话中，表现出他对于“要结束（越南战争）这件事是很认真的。”
    美国越败越惨　苏修加紧效劳
    今年新春以来，越南南方军民在各条战线上全面出击，空前沉重地打击了美国侵略者及其走狗，取得了震惊世界的辉煌成果。苏修领导集团对此惊慌失措、焦灼不安，最近一个月来顾不得粉饰打扮，干脆赤裸裸地跳出来，为被打得晕头转向的华盛顿主子出主意，积极效劳，把他们在越南问题上的叛卖活动推向一个新的高潮。
    正当全世界革命人民都在为越南南方人民的新春大捷而热烈欢呼的时候，苏修领导集团却开动他们的一切宣传机器，掀起了一阵空前狂热的越南“和谈”鼓噪。
    这些宣传，在所谓越南“和谈”和美帝的什么“理智”上大做文章；而对越南南方军民要在已取得的胜利的基础上，坚持战斗，打败美帝，夺取彻底胜利的坚定决心，却闭口不提。他们大喊大叫反对所谓越南问题的“军事解决”，而鼓吹“政治解决”和“停炸和谈”，宣传什么“谈判是可能的”，只要“美国停止轰炸，就能导致进行越南问题的和平谈判”，等等，拚命制造“和谈”空气。苏修领导集团还通过他们的宣传机器，大肆渲染美国强盗飞机的轰炸对越南北方造成的“巨大牺牲、损害和物资损失”。《红星报》二月六日还利用英国资产阶级报纸的话，宣扬“由于遭到新的失败，华盛顿可能‘失去理智，更加扩大战争’”。这些宣传，表面上是指责美国，实际上是妄图以此吓唬愈战愈强的越南人民。
    苏修集团还通过他们的报刊和通讯社一再向约翰逊政府献策，要它“听取理智的呼声”，“抓住机会”，下决心“利用”目前存在的“走出（越南战争）死胡同的可能性”，“停炸和谈”。
    苏修对越南人民如此压之、诱之，对华盛顿如此劝之、谏之，活活显出了一副叛徒和帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。
    与此同时，勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团在南越军民新春大捷以后，也大大加紧了策划“和谈”的罪恶活动。
    二月六日，柯西金在莫斯科接见美国驻苏联大使汤普森，进行密商。三天以后，二月九日，苏修集团授权塔斯社发表声明，以官方身份出面鼓吹“停炸和谈”。
    二月十一日至十二日，苏修邀请当时正为美国“和谈”骗局在世界各地奔走效劳的联合国秘书长吴丹访问莫斯科，同他一起“讨论越南和平的前景”。据透露，会谈中，苏修头目“向吴丹确保，他们愿意尽可能地帮助促进和谈”。
    二月十四日和十六日，柯西金和勃列日涅夫分别在明斯克和列宁格勒发表演说，鼓吹越南问题“不能靠军事解决”，而要“走政治解决的道路”，强调快点在越南“停炸和谈”。他们唱的这一套丑剧，同吴丹二月二十四日在联合国就他不久前为越南“和谈”在各地奔走的结果而发表的声明，完全是一个调子。
    这期间，苏修在国外也伸出触角，展开紧张的活动。在华盛顿，二月十五日和十六日，领了苏修的密旨刚刚返任的苏联驻美国大使，在二十四小时内接连两次同美国国务卿腊斯克举行会谈，密商越南问题。在伦敦，苏联驻英国大使在同一个时候，拜会了访美归来的英国首相威尔逊，听他“详细”传达了“美国目前对越南问题的态度”。在巴黎，苏联驻法国大使在二月二十日求见法国总统戴高乐，把苏修“对越南局势发展的态度”告诉他，并就越南问题“互相交流情况和磋商”。
    美帝败局已定　苏修难逃惩罚
    一边露骨地制造“和谈”舆论，一边紧张地进行策划“和谈”的活动，这十分清楚地表明，克里姆林宫的一伙叛徒工贼，为了把美帝从侵越战争的死胡同中救出来，实现华盛顿的“和谈”阴谋，已经达到了何等心急情切的程度。
    伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“朋友有真假，但通过实践可以看清谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友。”勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流长期来玩弄反革命两面派伎俩，大吹大擂，拚命把自己装扮成越南人民的朋友。然而，几年来、特别是近半年来他们破坏越南人民抗美救国战争，忠实为美帝效劳的叛徒行径，彻底戳穿了他们的画皮。他们对越南人民“支援”是假，出卖是真，反美是假，降美联美是真。
    美帝国主义侵越战争的败局已定，无耻出卖越南人民利益的苏修叛徒也必然逃脱不了历史的惩罚。英雄的越南人民必将冲破一切困难和障碍，把抗美救国战争坚持下去，直到取得最后胜利。
