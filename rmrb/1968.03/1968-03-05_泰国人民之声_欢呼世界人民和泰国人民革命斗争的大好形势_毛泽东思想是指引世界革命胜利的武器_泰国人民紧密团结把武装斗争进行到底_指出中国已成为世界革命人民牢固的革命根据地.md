“Voice of the Thai People” radio station issued a commentary on March 1, pointing out: “The highest peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—is being grasped by more and more revolutionary peoples of various countries, which is of extremely important significance for promoting the more rapid victory of the world revolution.”

The commentary titled “Firmly Persist in People’s War to the End Is Victory” pointed out that at present, the development of the international situation is just as the great leader of the world’s revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao, said: “The enemy is rotting away day by day, while we are growing stronger day by day.” The revolutionary forces of the peoples of various countries, including the revolutionary forces of the Thai people, are rapidly developing and growing stronger, and are achieving greater and greater victories, while the reactionary forces of imperialism headed by the United States and their running dogs are becoming more and more decadent.

The commentary said that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, China is achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Mao Zedong Thought has deeply taken root among the 700 million Chinese people, making socialist China more solid and powerful, and becoming a firm revolutionary base for the revolutionary peoples of the whole world.

The commentary said that the oppressed peoples of various countries are speeding up their awakening. The armed struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are like a raging wildfire, developing rapidly, with the most prominent being in the Southeast Asian region. The military offensives launched by the military and people of South Vietnam against American imperialism and its running dogs since the New Year have achieved unprecedented great victories. The people’s armed forces in Laos, Burma, Indonesia, Thailand, and other countries are developing rapidly. The revolutionary storm sweeping the globe is shaking the reactionary forces of imperialism headed by the United States and their running dogs in various countries, and their ruling positions are becoming increasingly unstable. The modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership group has further exposed its traitorous face of colluding with U.S. imperialism, and is severely condemned and resolutely opposed by the revolutionary peoples of various countries.

The commentary said that the current international situation is just as Chairman Mao pointed out: “We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will certainly deal a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world.” “The proletariat and working people of Europe, North America, and Oceania are awakening anew. The U.S. imperialists and all other harmful creatures have already prepared their own gravediggers, and the day of their burial will not be far off.”

In discussing the revolutionary struggles of the Thai people, the commentary said: “Because the Communist Party of Thailand combines Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the revolutionary practice of Thailand, correctly analyzes the situation, formulates policies and lines that are completely suitable for the Thai revolution, and clearly points out who are friends and who are enemies, and the revolutionary tasks of each stage, and bravely leads the people to carry out the national democratic revolution, to struggle for the true independence, democracy, and well-being of the Thai people. Therefore, the Communist Party of Thailand enjoys extremely high prestige among the people and gains the support of an increasingly broad mass of the people. The Communist Party of Thailand has become the core force that resolutely and bravely leads the people to struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the traitorous clique.”

The commentary said that the Communist Party of Thailand, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely opposes modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership group, and defends the purity of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, it also enjoys very high prestige internationally and gains the praise and support of the genuine Marxist-Leninist parties and revolutionary peoples of various countries.

The commentary pointed out that the people’s armed forces under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand are continuously developing and growing stronger, their operational scope is rapidly expanding, and their combat effectiveness and tactics are improving. With the support of the masses, the people’s armed forces have repeatedly smashed the enemy’s “encirclement and suppression,” annihilated a large number of enemies, and seized a large number of weapons. The people’s armed propaganda teams are active in the vast areas of the northeast, south, and north. The Thai people and the people’s armed forces are learning warfare from warfare and becoming stronger and stronger.

The commentary said that while rapidly developing the armed struggle in the countryside, the Communist Party of Thailand also leads the people in various forms of struggles in the political, economic, and other fields, and more and more people are participating in these struggles. People of various nationalities and classes, mass organizations, and all patriotic democratic personages have realized that to drive out U.S. imperialism and overthrow the traitorous clique of Thanom-Babbo, they must strengthen unity and organize a broad patriotic democratic united front. The Patriotic Front of Thailand is now more developed and stronger, and solemnly declared on January 1 that it resolutely supports the armed struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand.

The commentary finally emphasized, “The revolutionary struggle of the Thai people is a component part of the world revolution. Our struggle is not isolated but gains the enthusiastic support of the revolutionary peoples of the whole world, especially the powerful support of the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The international situation is favorable to the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people. As long as the Thai people are more closely united and broadly organized, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, resolutely persist in the armed struggle to the end, final victory will certainly belong to the Thai people, U.S. imperialism will certainly be driven out of Thai territory, and the traitorous clique of Thanom-Babbo will certainly be overthrown, and an independent, democratic, and prosperous new Thailand will certainly emerge.”

    “泰国人民之声”欢呼世界人民和泰国人民革命斗争的大好形势
    毛泽东思想是指引世界革命胜利的武器
    泰国人民紧密团结把武装斗争进行到底
    指出中国已成为世界革命人民牢固的革命根据地
    新华社三日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台三月一日发表评论指出：“当代马克思列宁主义的最高峰——毛泽东思想更多地为各国革命人民所掌握，这对于推动世界革命更快地取得胜利，具有极其重要的意义。”
    这篇题为《坚决把人民战争坚持到底就是胜利》的评论指出，目前，国际形势的发展，正如世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席所说：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。”各国人民的革命力量包括泰国人民的革命力量在迅速发展壮大，并取得越来越伟大的胜利，而以美国为首的帝国主义反动势力及其走狗却日益衰败。
    评论说，在毛主席和中国共产党领导下，中国正在取得无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。毛泽东思想在七亿中国人民中深深地扎下了根，使社会主义中国更加坚固强大，成为全世界革命人民牢固的革命根据地。
    评论说，各国被压迫人民正在加速觉醒。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民武装斗争犹如燎原烈火，迅速发展，最突出的是东南亚地区。南越军民新春以来对美帝国主义及其走狗发动的大规模军事攻势，取得了空前伟大的胜利。老挝、缅甸、印度尼西亚、泰国以及其他国家的人民武装正迅速向前发展。席卷全球的革命风暴震撼着以美国为首的帝国主义反动势力及其各国走狗，它们的统治地位日益动摇不稳。以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义更进一步暴露了它们与美帝狼狈为奸的叛徒面目，遭到各国革命人民的严厉谴责和坚决反对。
    评论说，当前国际形势正如毛主席所指出的：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。”“欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”
    评论在谈到泰国人民的革命斗争时说：“由于泰国共产党把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想与泰国的革命实践相结合，正确分析形势，制订完全适合泰国革命的方针政策，给人民指明谁是朋友，谁是敌人，指明各个阶段的革命任务，并坚决勇敢地带领人民进行民族民主革命，为争取泰国的真正独立、民主、人民的安居乐业而斗争。因此，泰国共产党在人民中享有极高的威望，获得越来越广泛的人民群众的支持。泰国共产党已成为泰国人民坚决勇敢地同美帝国主义及其走狗卖国集团进行斗争的核心力量。”
    评论说，泰国共产党高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决反对以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，因此，在国际上也享有很高的威望，获得各国真正马克思列宁主义政党和革命人民的赞扬和支持。
    评论指出，泰国共产党领导下的人民武装力量不断发展壮大，活动范围迅速扩展，战斗力和战术都提高了。在人民群众的支持下，人民武装一次又一次地粉碎了敌人的“围剿”，歼灭了大量敌人，缴获大批武器。人民武装宣传队活跃在东北部、南部和北部的广大地区。泰国人民和人民武装正在从战争中学习战争，而且越战越强。
    评论说，在迅速发展农村人民武装斗争的同时，泰国共产党还领导人民在政治、经济等方面进行了各种形式的斗争，参加到这些斗争中的人民越来越多。各民族和各阶层人民、群众团体和所有爱国民主人士认识到，要驱逐美帝国主义，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团，就只有加强团结，组织起广泛的爱国民主统一战线。泰国爱国阵线现在更加发展壮大，并在今年一月一日郑重宣布，坚决支持泰共领导下的武装斗争。
    评论最后强调指出，“泰国人民的革命斗争是世界革命的一个组成部分。我们的斗争并不孤立，而是获得全世界革命人民的热情支持，特别是获得了用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民的有力支持。国际形势有利于泰国人民的革命斗争。只要泰国人民更紧密团结和广泛组织起来，在泰国共产党领导下，坚决把武装斗争坚持到底，最后胜利就一定属于泰国人民，美帝国主义一定要被驱逐出泰国领土，美帝国主义的走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团一定要被推翻，独立、民主、繁荣的新泰国一定会出现。”
