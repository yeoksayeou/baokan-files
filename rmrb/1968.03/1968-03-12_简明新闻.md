	Syria's President Condemns U.S. Imperialism's Intrigues in the Middle East

	Syrian head of state Nur al-Din al-Atassi, in a speech at a rally celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Syrian Revolution on March 8, said that U.S. imperialism supported Israel's aggression against Arab countries last June and subsequently used the United Nations to pass a British proposal that coerces the Arab people into submission. Now, it has sent a UN "special envoy," Jarring, to Arab countries to promote this resolution. The Syrian people reject this resolution because it equates the aggressor with the victim, not only failing to punish the aggressor but rewarding them. This resolution has become a new pretext for Israel to continue occupying Arab territories.

	Guinea Youth Organization's Resolution Condemns U.S. Aggression in Vietnam

	The Fifth National Congress of the Guinea African Democratic Revolutionary Youth Organization, held from March 4 to 7 in Conakry, passed a resolution. The resolution strongly condemns imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and solemnly reaffirms its unconditional support for the heroic and glorious Vietnamese youth and people.

	The resolution, in discussing the Middle East issue, states: "The Guinea African Democratic Revolutionary Youth Organization Congress strongly condemns imperialism's aggression against the peoples of the Arab countries."

	French Ruling Class Fails to Suppress Guadeloupe Patriots

	The French ruling class, in an attempt to suppress the national independence movement in Guadeloupe (a French territory in Latin America), has failed in its trial of nineteen Guadeloupe anti-colonialist fighters.

	This illegal trial began on February 19 in Paris. The Guadeloupe anti-colonialist fighters bravely fought in court. Under the firm resistance of the Guadeloupe patriots and the pressure of progressive public opinion, the French authorities, finding themselves at a loss for words and arguments, were forced to acquit thirteen of the nineteen detained patriots, but still unreasonably sentenced six of them to three or four years in prison, suspended.

	Indian Reactionaries Aim to Replace British Imperialism in the Indian Ocean

	With the encouragement and support of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, the Indian reactionary government openly declared its intention to replace British imperialism in controlling the Indian Ocean.

	Indian Navy Chief of Staff Chatterji boasted, "When the British fleet withdraws in 1971, the Indian Navy will fully take over the defense of the Indian Ocean." This is a very reactionary slogan of "filling the vacuum" spread by the Indian reactionaries. To this end, the Indian reactionary government decided to divide the naval leadership into eastern and western naval commands and to establish a separate eastern fleet. At the same time, despite domestic economic difficulties, it will increase naval vessels and recruit more naval personnel.

　　阿塔西谴责美帝在中东的阴谋活动
    叙利亚国家元首努尔丁·阿塔西在庆祝三月八日叙利亚革命五周年举行的集会上说，美帝国主义去年六月支持以色列侵略阿拉伯国家，在这以后又利用联合国通过一项迫使阿拉伯人民屈服的关于中东问题的英国提案，现在则派遣联合国“特使”雅林到阿拉伯国家推销这一决议。叙利亚人民拒绝接受这一决议，因为这个决议把被侵略者和侵略者相提并论，不仅不惩罚侵略者，反而犒赏他们，这个决议成了以色列人继续霸占阿拉伯领土的新借口。
    几内亚青年组织总决议谴责美帝侵越
    几内亚非洲民主革命青年组织第五届全国代表大会，三月四日到七日在科纳克里举行会议并通过了一项总决议。总决议强烈谴责帝国主义在越南进行的侵略，并庄严重申对英勇的、光荣的越南青年和越南人民的无条件的声援和支持。
    总决议在谈到中东问题时说：“几内亚非洲民主革命青年组织代表大会强烈谴责帝国主义对阿拉伯各国人民的侵略。”
    法统治集团迫害瓜德罗普爱国者失败
    法国统治集团为了镇压瓜德罗普（法国在拉丁美洲属地）民族独立运动而对十九名瓜德罗普反殖民主义战士的“审判”，已经遭到失败。
    这次非法审判是从二月十九日开始在巴黎举行的。瓜德罗普反殖民主义战士在法庭上进行了英勇的斗争。正是在瓜德罗普爱国者们坚决斗争和进步舆论的压力下，法国当局词穷理屈，才不得不对被捕的十九名爱国者中的十三人宣布无罪释放，但仍然对其中六人无理宣判三年或四年徒刑，缓期执行。
    印度反动派妄图接替英帝控制印度洋
    在苏修叛徒集团的怂恿和支持下，印度反动政府公然宣布要接替英帝国主义控制印度洋。
    印度海军参谋长查特吉叫嚷说：“英国舰队在一九七一年撤出时，印度海军将把印度洋的防务完全担负起来。”这是印度反动派散布的十分反动的“填补真空”的滥调。为此，印度反动政府决定把海军领导机构划分为东部和西部两个海军司令部，还将单独成立一支东海舰队；同时，不顾国内的经济困难，将增加海军舰只，增募海军人员。
