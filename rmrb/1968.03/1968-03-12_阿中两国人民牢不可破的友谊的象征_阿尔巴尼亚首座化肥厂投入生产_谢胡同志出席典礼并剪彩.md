The unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Albania and China: Albania's first fertilizer plant begins production, Comrade Shehu attends the ceremony and cuts the ribbon

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 10th: Albania's first fertilizer plant, the Fieri Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, held a grand ceremony on March 8th to mark the start of its production. Comrade Shehu, Chairman of the Albanian Council of Ministers, attended the ceremony and personally cut the ribbon.

On this day, the grand and magnificent factory building of the Fieri Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant was adorned with giant portraits of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. The square was filled with red flags and revolutionary songs played by the orchestra. Tens of thousands of workers, agricultural cooperative members, soldiers and officers of the People's Army, government officials, and students from Tirana and Fieri gathered to celebrate the construction of Albania's first fertilizer plant under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour, and the struggle against the blockade and sabotage by imperialism and revisionism.

Attending the ceremony were also Albanian Deputy Prime Minister Charcani, Central Committee Secretary Spasiu, and other relevant department heads.

The acting chargé d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Li Tingqian, and Chinese engineering and technical personnel who participated in the construction of the Fieri Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant were also invited to attend the ceremony.

At noon, the mass rally began, with Charcani and Li Tingqian speaking in turn.

Comrade Charcani first expressed his heartfelt congratulations on behalf of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, the Council of Ministers, and the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, to the factory and the people of Fieri. He said: Albania was once the most backward country in Europe, but today it has its own new chemical industry, which fills the Albanian people with immense joy and pride. This is a great victory for the Albanian Party of Labour's correct and far-sighted policy in building socialism. It is a great victory for the Party's directive on self-reliance in building socialism.

Comrade Charcani said: Under the Party's guidance, the builders of the Fieri Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant understand that building a nitrogen fertilizer plant is first and foremost a great political struggle. The Albanian working class and people, under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, rely on their unshakable confidence in their own strength and high revolutionary spirit, and with the internationalist aid of the Chinese people, have resolutely smashed the savage blockade by the Soviet revisionist leadership against Albania's socialist construction.

Comrade Charcani pointed out: The completion and smooth operation of the Fieri Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant is a symbol of the unbreakable friendship between the Albanian people and the great Chinese people. It is a vivid manifestation of the proletarian internationalism of the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. He said: On behalf of the Albanian Party of Labour, the government, and the people of the entire country, we once again express our deepest gratitude and appreciation to the great Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, the great leader of the Chinese people and the most beloved friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong.

Comrade Li Tingqian, on behalf of the Chinese Embassy in Albania and the Chinese engineering and technical personnel working in Albania, extended the warmest congratulations to the brotherly Albanian people and all the employees of the nitrogen fertilizer plant.

Comrade Li Tingqian reported on the excellent situation in which the Chinese people are fighting under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Li Tingqian finally enthusiastically praised the fraternal friendship and combat unity between the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of China and Albania. He said: This friendship and unity were personally forged by Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, formed in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, tested by the storms of international class struggle, and are eternal and unbreakable.

The speeches of Comrades Charcani and Li Tingqian were repeatedly interrupted by slogans such as "Long live Enver-Mao," "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha," "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong," and "Long live Sino-Albanian friendship!"

After the meeting, Comrade Shehu, amid enthusiastic applause, cut the ribbon to mark the start of production at the nitrogen fertilizer plant and toured the entire production process of the factory.

    查尔查尼同志说：在党教育下的费里氮肥厂的建设者们懂得，建设氮肥厂首先是一场伟大的政治斗争。阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级和人民，在党和霍查同志的领导下，依靠对自己力量毫不动摇的信心和高度的革命气概，并在中国人民的国际主义援助下，坚决粉碎了苏修领导集团对阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设的野蛮封锁。
    查尔查尼同志指出：费里氮肥厂的建成并顺利投入生产，是阿尔巴尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民之间牢不可破的友谊的象征。它是毛泽东同志领导下的中国人民和中国共产党的无产阶级国际主义的生动表现。他说：我代表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、政府和全国人民，向伟大的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党、中国政府和杰出的马克思列宁主义者、中国人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民最敬爱的朋友毛泽东同志，再次表示最深切的谢意和感激。

    李庭荃同志最后热情称颂中阿两党、两国和两国人民的兄弟友谊和战斗团结。他说：这种友谊和团结是毛主席和霍查同志亲自缔造的，是在反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中形成的，是经过国际阶级斗争的大风大浪考验的，是永恒和牢不可破的。
