In the basement of a French peasant's home, there hangs a colorful portrait of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin inspecting the cultural revolution troops on Tiananmen. The owner of the house often invites his friends to listen to broadcasts from Beijing here. Once, after they finished listening, a progressive friend said, "I saw the great leader Chairman Mao in Beijing last year. I am the happiest person." He also said, "We firmly believe that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolution in France will surely achieve final victory." Another worker said, "The sun in the sky can only illuminate half of the earth. Now, we have a red sun in our hearts, that is the great leader Chairman Mao. He will forever illuminate the hearts of all the people of the world." Finally, the owner and everyone together raised their glasses many times, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!

Following Chairman Mao to Make the Revolution

In a remote mountain village in France, there lives a young shepherd. His father and younger brother are both members of the French Communist Party. He resolutely struggled against his family and left home alone. Every day, he insists on studying the works of Chairman Mao for two hours. He has read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" many times and can recite many of its aphorisms. He said, "The revolution of the present era, if it does not have the contemporary Lenin—Chairman Mao and his thought to guide it, is not possible. Through studying the works of Chairman Mao, I have come to understand who the enemy is and who the friend is, enabling me to resolutely oppose the French revisionists and stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint. I also often write articles to the Paris 'Red Guards' newspaper and 'New Humanity' newspaper to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, so that more French people can also grasp Mao Zedong Thought. We must follow Chairman Mao to make the revolution."

Long Live Chairman Mao Forever!

On a French worker's birthday, he enthusiastically told a Chinese comrade, "According to French national customs, birthdays are celebrated by inviting friends to drink." He then invited the Chinese comrade and a few of his worker friends to his home to drink. At this family gathering, someone proposed a toast to Chairman Mao's health, and everyone joyfully raised their glasses high, first toasting to Chairman Mao's eternal life! Then they drank it all at once. Following this, the worker said, "We are people living in a capitalist society. Here, we toast to Chairman Mao's health, which fully expresses the aspirations of the French working class." Finally, the Chinese comrade presented a photo of the great leader Chairman Mao to the French worker comrade. They were overjoyed, and one of the workers said, "When I go back, I will frame Chairman Mao's portrait. This way, we can see him every day."

    法国工人农民的心愿
    我是最幸福的人
    在法国一位农民家中的地下室里，墙上挂着一幅毛主席和林副主席在天安门上检阅文化革命大军的彩色画像。这个家庭的主人经常邀集他的朋友们在这里收听北京的广播。有一次，他们收听完以后，一位进步朋友说：“我去年在北京见到了伟大的领袖毛主席，我是最幸福的人。”他还说：“我们坚信，在毛泽东思想的指引下，法国的无产阶级革命一定会取得最后的胜利。”另一位工人说：“天上的太阳只能照亮地球的一半，现在，我们心中有个红太阳，就是伟大的领袖毛主席。他永远照亮全世界人民的心。”最后，主人和大家一起频频举杯，祝福毛主席万寿无疆！
    跟着毛主席干革命
    在法国一个偏僻的山村，住着一个牧羊的青年。他的父亲和弟弟都是法修党员。他向家庭进行了坚决的斗争，一个人毅然地离开了家庭。他每天都坚持学习毛主席著作两小时。他把《毛主席语录》通读了许多遍，许多警句都能背下来。他说：“当代革命如果没有当代的列宁——毛主席和他的思想来指导，是不行的。我通过学习毛主席著作，认清了谁是敌人？谁是朋友？使我能够坚决反对法修，站稳了无产阶级立场。我还经常写稿到巴黎《红卫兵报》和《新人道报》去，宣传毛泽东思想，为的是使更多的法国人民也能够掌握毛泽东思想。我们要跟着毛主席干革命。”
    敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    一位法国工人过生日那天，热情地对中国同志说：“按照法国的民族习惯，过生日要请朋友喝酒。”于是，他把中国同志和他的几个工人朋友请到他家中去喝酒。在这个家庭酒会上，有人提议为毛主席的健康干杯，大家兴高采烈地把酒杯高高举起，首先敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！然后一饮而尽。接着，这位工人说：“我们是生活在资本主义社会里的人，我们在这里为毛主席的健康干杯，这完全表达了我们法国工人阶级的心愿。”最后，中国同志把伟大领袖毛主席的照片送给了法国工人同志。他们高兴极了，其中一位工人说：“我回去以后，要把毛主席的像镶在镜框里。这样，我们每天就能看到他老人家了。”
