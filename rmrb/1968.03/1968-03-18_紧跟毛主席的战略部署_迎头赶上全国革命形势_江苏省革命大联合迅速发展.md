In accordance with the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary tripartite alliance in Jiangsu Province have surged forward, developing rapidly. Currently, over 80% of the counties and cities in the province have achieved revolutionary great alliance, and cities like Wuxi, as well as counties such as Jiangning, Qidong, and Yizheng, have achieved revolutionary tripartite alliance. A large number of temporary power organs for revolutionary tripartite alliance have been established in grassroots units like rain after spring. The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire province is excellent and getting better.

The excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangsu Province is the result of the revolutionary enthusiasm and vigor of the revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses in the province, who have swiftly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Since this year, the proletarian revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses in Jiangsu Province, through repeated study and deep understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have summarized the experiences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, deeply recognizing that following Chairman Mao is victory. With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, catch up with the advanced steps of the proletarian revolutionary masses nationwide, advance bravely, and strive for the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and eliminating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, they have enhanced proletarian party spirit, exposed the black hands that disrupt and sabotage the revolutionary ranks, and the tide of revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary tripartite alliance has rapidly spread throughout the province. The important city of Wuxi on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, under the leadership of the working class and with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist personnel, achieved revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary tripartite alliance in less than a month and a half, establishing the Municipal Revolutionary Committee. In the provincial capital Nanjing, over 90% of the factories and enterprises have achieved revolutionary great alliance, and six out of nine districts have established temporary power organs for revolutionary tripartite alliance.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." In the process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, various cities and rural areas in Jiangsu Province have firmly grasped the key of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes. With the great help of the People's Liberation Army, the province has, in a short period, held tens of thousands of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The proletarian revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses in the study classes have carried forward the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, being loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao with a single-minded devotion, and grasping the application of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various places have firmly grasped class education, greatly arousing the profound proletarian feelings of the broad revolutionary masses for Chairman Mao, and enhancing the self-awareness of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

After achieving revolutionary great alliance, the proletarian revolutionary masses in various places, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on cadre issues, have correctly handled cadre issues. Provinces, cities, prefectures, counties, and many grassroots units have seen a large number of revolutionary cadres step forward, creating conditions for achieving revolutionary tripartite alliance.

Currently, the proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in Jiangsu Province are determined to strive bravely for the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　紧跟毛主席的战略部署  迎头赶上全国革命形势
    江苏省革命大联合迅速发展
    据新华社南京十三日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，江苏省革命大联合和革命三结合的热潮一浪高过一浪，迅速发展。目前，全省百分之八十以上的县、市实现了革命大联合，无锡市和江宁、启东、仪征等一批重要的县，实现了革命三结合。大批基层单位革命三结合的临时权力机构如雨后春笋，纷纷建立起来。全省无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，越来越好。
    江苏省无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，是全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众以饱满的政治热情，充沛的革命干劲，迅速落实毛主席一系列最新指示的结果。今年以来，江苏省的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，通过反复学习、深刻领会毛主席的一系列最新指示，总结了一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的经验，深刻地认识到，紧跟毛主席就是胜利。他们满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，迎头赶上全国无产阶级革命派的先进步伐，高歌猛进，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。他们通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，揪出伸向革命队伍进行破坏和捣乱的黑手，革命大联合和革命三结合的热潮迅速遍及全省。沪宁线上的重要城市无锡市，在工人阶级的带动下，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，在不到一个半月的时间里，就迅速实现了全市革命大联合和革命三结合，成立了市革命委员会。省会南京市，也有百分之九十以上的工厂企业实现了革命大联合，全市九个区有六个区建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”在落实毛主席一系列最新指示的过程中，江苏省各地城乡，紧紧抓住大力办好毛泽东思想学习班这个关键。在人民解放军的大力帮助下，全省在短短的时间里，办起了数以十万计的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在学习班里，发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，对无产阶级伟大导师毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，把无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情，落实到活学活用毛主席著作、贯彻毛主席的最新指示上。各地举办的毛泽东思想学习班，都狠抓阶级教育，大大激发了广大革命群众对毛主席的无比深厚的无产阶级感情，加强了活学活用毛主席著作和落实毛主席最新指示的自觉性。
    各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在实现革命大联合以后，遵照毛主席有关干部问题的教导，正确地对待干部，省、市、专区、县和许多基层单位，都有大批革命干部站了出来，为实现革命三结合创造了条件。
    目前，江苏省的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，决心为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋勇前进。
