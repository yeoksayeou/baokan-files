The victorious South Vietnamese people's liberation armed forces, who achieved a stunning victory during the Lunar New Year, are continuing their advance on all fronts. In the first few days of March, they frequently attacked enemy bases, strongholds, and towns, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy's combat forces and war materials.

On March 2, the people's liberation armed forces in the Saigon-Cholon area, near the heart of the enemy, ambushed a unit of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division's 1st Brigade on a densely forested road about 15 kilometers north of Saigon. They heavily damaged one company. According to Western news agencies, the people's liberation armed forces, from well-prepared positions, launched a fierce assault with machine guns and rocket launchers. Many U.S. invaders were killed or wounded, and the rest fled in panic, only to step on mines planted by the liberation forces in the bushes along the road. According to the reduced figures from Western news agencies, this under-strength company of U.S. invaders had 48 killed, 10 "missing," and 28 wounded. The U.S. command in Vietnam admitted that the U.S. forces suffered heavy casualties in this battle.

On March 4, the people's liberation armed forces launched a fierce artillery attack on two large U.S. air bases in South Vietnam, Danang and Bien Hoa, as well as the largest U.S. oil storage area in South Vietnam, Cat Lai. According to Western news agencies, the Danang air base and the nearby Marble Mountain base, about 5 kilometers southeast of Danang, as well as the U.S. Fourth Logistics Command, which provides supplies for the U.S. Marine Corps in Danang, were all hit by artillery fire, illuminating the night sky over Danang with blazing fires.

The Bien Hoa air base was also hit by accurate artillery shells from the people's liberation armed forces. According to reports, this artillery attack occurred just a few hours after a company of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade was ambushed while patrolling nearby. Western news agencies revealed that in this ambush, three-quarters of the personnel of this company of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division were killed or wounded.

The Cat Lai oil storage area, about 8 kilometers south of Saigon, was hit by artillery fire from the people's liberation armed forces, and the fire burned for six hours until it was extinguished at dawn.

In the first few days of March, U.S. military bases in the demilitarized zone south of Khe Sanh, Carroll Camp, Yung Ling, Dong Ha, and the rear base of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division in An Xuyen, Binh Dinh Province, as well as the counties and provincial capitals of Phuoc Long, Phong Dinh, and Vi Thanh in the Mekong Delta, were all subjected to fierce attacks by the liberation forces, suffering heavy losses.

According to a report from Hanoi on March 3, the heroic military and civilian people of various places in South Vietnam, riding the momentum of the Lunar New Year victory, bravely advanced and continuously attacked the enemy, achieving great results.

According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the people's liberation armed forces in Bien Hoa Province launched a fierce attack on the U.S. and puppet military base in Tra Cu and the Bien Hoa air base and Long Binh U.S. logistics base on the night of February 17 and the early morning of February 18, achieving great victories. In Tra Cu, the people's liberation armed forces attacked the U.S. and Australian and New Zealand puppet artillery positions and armored vehicle parking lot, killing more than 200 U.S. and Australian and New Zealand puppet soldiers, destroying 70 tanks and armored vehicles, and 9 cannons. In the attack on the Bien Hoa air base, the people's liberation armed forces destroyed 6 jet fighters, 2 C-130 large transport planes, and hit 2 buildings housing U.S. military officers and technicians, 30 tents, and 3 ammunition depots. At the Long Binh logistics base, the people's liberation armed forces' artillery destroyed several enemy ammunition depots, chemical material warehouses, and fuel depots, killing hundreds of U.S. soldiers defending the base.

The people's liberation armed forces in Tuy Hoa Province bombarded the U.S. base in Lai Thieu four times from February 18 to 21, killing or wounding more than 200 U.S. invaders and South Korean puppet soldiers, destroying 7 enemy aircraft, and causing an ammunition depot to explode.

The people's liberation armed forces in Chau Doc Province surrounded and attacked the enemy headquarters in Chau Doc City again from the night of February 17 to the early morning of February 18. During the attack on the Chau Doc air base, the liberation army burned down many of the enemy's fuel depots and shot down 3 enemy aircraft. From morning to afternoon on February 18, the people's liberation armed forces fought bravely for eight consecutive hours, inflicting a heavy blow on the enemy's counterattack, annihilating more than 300 U.S. and puppet soldiers in one go.

The people's liberation armed forces in Can Tho Province, on February 19, routed the enemy's multiple counterattacks protected by an armored battalion in the suburbs of Can Tho City, killing more than 300 enemy soldiers, including more than 100 U.S. invaders. From February 24 to 27, the people's liberation armed forces frequently attacked the enemy, killing more than 440 enemy soldiers, including more than 200 U.S. invaders, sinking 14 landing boats, shooting down 9 aircraft, burning down 4 fuel and ammunition depots, and seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

The people's liberation armed forces in Phu Thuan Province launched fierce attacks on many enemy military targets and puppet government headquarters in Phu Thuan City from February 18 to 20 over three days, annihilating nearly 1,400 U.S. and puppet soldiers, heavily damaging two U.S. and puppet battalions, and capturing the enemy's military stronghold, the puppet "provincial governor's" residence, the puppet police headquarters, the puppet 53rd Engineering Battalion's base, the Phu Thuan City puppet government office, and prison, liberating 800 patriots imprisoned by the enemy.
