	The night before National Day last year, a cable crossing a certain river became tangled, seriously affecting communications.

	At that time, I had caught a cold from working in the rain and had been suffering from stomach pain and diarrhea for several days, feeling completely drained. However, I thought that this was a critical moment in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, and it was also the eve of National Day. If the line could not be repaired in time, it would hinder the great commander's leadership of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, causing losses to the Party and the people. Without regard for my weakness and illness, I immediately rushed to the scene with another comrade and began the urgent repair work.

	The river was wide, and the cables were tightly tangled. After shaking them from the shore for a while, we were exhausted and sweaty, but it was to no avail. We decided to go into the water and use a rope to pull the tangled cables apart. Since we couldn't find a rope, we had to use a steel bar instead.

	I held the steel bar that was hooked onto the power line and jumped into the river, which was over three meters deep. I hadn't swum far when a strong electric current hit me, making my arms jump. I let go of the steel bar, and it bounced back to the shore.

	"Our army has an indomitable spirit. It will vanquish all enemies and never be subdued by them." Chairman Mao's teachings gave me boundless courage and strength. I jumped into the water a second time. The swift river current and the strong electric current both assailed me. With every stroke forward, it was a struggle. When I was almost at the center of the river, my leg cramped, and my body couldn't hold on, causing me to swallow several mouthfuls of water. Just then, an even stronger electric current hit me, making my whole body ache, and the steel bar bounced back to the shore again.

	I hesitated for a moment: the water was deep and swift, the electric current was strong, and the cables were so tightly tangled. Could I pull them apart? My body was weak, and with the cold water and electric shock, plus the cramp, even if the electric current didn't kill me, I might drown. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao's great teachings echoed in my ears: "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai." To ensure Chairman Mao's command, I would charge through fire and water. No matter how strong the electric current, it couldn't match the power of Mao Zedong Thought; no matter how cold the river water, my heart had an eternal red sun. No matter how tightly the cables were tangled, I would pull them apart and ensure smooth communication for the proletarian headquarters. Red communications soldiers are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and must seize every second without delay. Thinking this, I tightly grasped the steel bar, shouting, "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." I jumped into the water from upstream, riding the swift current, and struggled towards the opposite shore. After a tense battle, I finally pulled apart the tightly tangled cables and successfully completed the repair task.

	After getting out of the water, the cold wind turned my lips purple, and I couldn't speak, but my heart was burning like fire. Facing the sunrise, looking at the smooth communication lines, and thinking of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's teachings being swiftly transmitted to every corner of the country, I felt an indescribable joy and happiness!

    心里有颗红太阳，线路畅通有保障
    通信兵某部班长　张凡骋
    去年国庆前夕，某河口上的飞线发生了混线故障，严重地影响了通信联络。
    当时，我因为冒雨修路着了凉，肚痛腹泻好几天，浑身一点劲都没有。但是，想到现在正是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的时刻，又是国庆前夕，线路如果不能及时修通，就会妨碍伟大统帅对无产阶级文化大革命的指挥，就会给党和人民造成损失。我顾不得体弱有病，马上和另一个同志奔到现场，投入了紧张的抢修战斗。
    这里水面较宽，飞线交叉混得很紧，在岸上摇打了一阵，累得满头大汗，毫无效果。我们决定下水用绳子把绞线拉开。绳子没能借到，只好用钢筋来代替。
    我用手拉着搭在电线上的钢筋，跳进三米多深的大河。没游多远，一股强烈的电流袭来，打得我两臂直跳，我的手一松，钢筋被弹回岸边。
      “这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”毛主席的教导，给了我无穷的勇气和力量。我第二次跳下水，湍急的河水，强烈的电流，一齐向我袭来，每向前划进一步，就是一场搏斗。快游到河中心的时候，我的腿抽筋了，身体支持不住，一连呛了几口水。正在这时，又一股更强烈的电流袭来，打得我全身疼痛，钢筋又一次从我手里弹回岸上。
    我心里有点犹豫：水深流急，电流很强，线又混得这么紧，能拉得开吗？自己身体又不好，水冷电打，加上抽筋，即使电不死，也有被淹死的危险。在这关键时刻，毛主席的伟大教导响在我的耳边：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。为了保证毛主席的指挥，就是刀山火海也要冲过去。电流再强，没有毛泽东思想的威力强；河水再凉，我的心中有永远不落的红太阳。不管钢线混得多么紧，我也要把它拉开，保证无产阶级司令部的通信顺畅。红色通信兵无限忠于毛主席要分秒必争，不能耽误一秒钟。想到这里，我紧紧抓住钢筋，高喊：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”从上游跳下水，乘着湍急的流势，奋力向对岸冲去。经过一场紧张的搏斗，终于拉开了混得很紧的钢线，胜利地完成了抢修任务。
    上岸后，冷风一吹，嘴唇冻得发紫，说不出话来，但我的心却象火一样热。我迎着朝阳，看着通畅的线路，想到毛主席和林副主席的教导，正迅速地传达到祖国的四面八方，内心感到说不出的愉快和幸福！
