Chairman Mao teaches us: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What standard do we use? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing and actually combines with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Those who are willing and actually combine with the workers and peasants are revolutionary; otherwise, they are not revolutionary, or even counter-revolutionary." Chairman Mao has pointed out the only correct and bright path for the youth to achieve ideological revolution. This is the greatest concern, greatest expectation, and greatest encouragement for the youth.

Over the past few years, especially since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have deeply felt that intellectuals combining with workers and peasants is a necessity for the socialist revolution and socialist construction. It is an important measure to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensure that the ironclad mountain of the proletariat will never change color. It is the only way for young intellectuals to achieve ideological revolution.

The fundamental path for intellectuals to transform themselves

In 1964, after graduating from university, I was honored to join the People's Liberation Army of China. When I stepped into this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, I felt it was very different from my previous school, and I felt especially warm.

Soon after arriving at the unit, the Party, in order to cultivate me quickly, sent me to the countryside for labor practice and to participate in the Four Clean-ups movement. At that time, I had insufficient understanding of the great significance of combining with the masses of workers and peasants and the urgency of ideological transformation. I thought that someone like me, with a good family background, going to the countryside was like a daughter of poor peasants returning to her parents. Combining with workers and peasants would be no problem at all.

However, after going down, it was not as simple as I had imagined. When struggling against reactionary actions of landlords, every poor peasant was filled with deep hatred, angrily exposing and resolutely struggling. But my hatred for the landlords was not as deep as that of the poor peasants. Although I said I would learn from the poor peasants, in my heart, I felt that I had more education and knew more about things. Thus, I unconsciously adopted an attitude of educating others, talking endlessly to the masses. But the villagers did not wait for me to finish; some shook their heads and said they did not understand. When I worked with the villagers, although I worked hard, I could not last more than three days before my waist and legs ached, and I did not want to move. The villagers said, "These young students are good at writing and drawing, but when it comes to wielding a pickaxe, they are weak." During rest times, the villagers would chat happily, but when I went, they talked less. When sleeping with an old peasant woman, she did not let the children come near me, fearing I would find them dirty; when eating at the same table, she would let me eat the good and fine food, fearing I would not be able to eat the coarse food.

What did these situations indicate? At night, I lay in bed, tossing and turning, and a series of question marks appeared in my mind: I was originally a person of poor peasant origin, why was my class stance not as firm as that of the poor peasants? Why was my hatred not as clear as theirs? I was originally a child born and raised in the countryside, why did the poor peasants not understand my words? Why did they say I was weak at wielding a pickaxe? Why did they take such good care of me? I began to feel that in my thoughts, emotions, and life, I had already developed a certain distance from the poor peasants. The poor peasant nature in me had begun to change. I remembered that when I was in university, my father had instructed me, "Our family has been exploited and oppressed for generations, and there has never been anyone who could read. Chairman Mao led us poor people to stand up, and you, a girl, were able to go to university. Don't forget the poor people!" I thought of my forgetting my roots and felt very sad.

But why, after studying in the city for a few years, did I have such a big gap with the masses of workers and peasants? In the past, although I also felt that there were problems with the school's teaching, I did not know exactly where the problem was. It was not until this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that I further realized: the culprit is China's Khrushchev. China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line instilled bourgeois ideology in young people, leading them down the capitalist path of detaching from labor, detaching from reality, detaching from the masses of workers and peasants, and seeking fame and profit. Initially, I found those bourgeois evil winds and stench disgusting and resisted them in my thoughts. Later, I gradually got used to them. I did not realize that I had already been corrupted by bourgeois ideology until I went down to live with the poor peasants. I realized that if we do not thoroughly smash this revisionist educational line, thoroughly eliminate its poison, and resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, taking the path of combining with the masses of workers and peasants, we young people will forget class and class struggle, forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and become successors of the bourgeoisie. I deeply felt that a person's origin cannot determine the path they take. Those with good origins, if they relax their ideological transformation, will also be corrupted by bourgeois ideology and even fall into the quagmire of revisionism. My original "automatic red" thinking was completely wrong. There is only "transformed red," not "automatic red." As Chairman Mao teaches, "Not only those whose basic stance has not yet turned over need to be transformed, but everyone should learn and be transformed. 'Without this transformation, nothing can be done well, everything will be out of place.' This is an absolute truth. I decided to follow the bright path pointed out by Chairman Mao, combining with the masses of workers and peasants, to quickly shorten the distance with the poor peasants and strengthen my ideological transformation.

In the practice of mass struggle, experiencing storms and gaining experience

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the midst of the masses and tempered in the great winds and storms of revolution." If we want to be successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause and want to experience storms and gain experience in the midst of mass struggles, we must actively throw ourselves into the three great revolutionary movements and into the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

What do we succeed? Ultimately, it is to succeed in revolution, to succeed in Mao Zedong Thought. I feel that without combining with the masses of workers and peasants, it is impossible to succeed in this. The broad masses of workers and peasants understand class and class struggle the best, understand exploitation and oppression the best. Their class viewpoint is the clearest, their class stance is the firmest, their hatred is the clearest, they understand revolution the best, and they are the most daring in revolution.

When participating in the Four Clean-ups in the countryside, I saw that the broad masses of poor peasants always stood at the forefront of the struggle. They were the most active in struggling against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. As soon as I entered the village, a poor peasant with deep bitterness said to me, "In our village, the landlords are not stinky, and the poor peasants are not fragrant." With one sentence, he exposed the class struggle situation in the village. Later, this peasant exposed many crimes of the landlord elements. The broad masses of poor peasants in class struggle were not afraid of threats and intimidation from landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, nor were they deceived by their sweet talk. How landlords and rich peasants dreamed of "changing the sky," how they used money, beautiful women, and meat to bribe and corrupt cadres; how they engaged in speculation; how they worshipped ancestral graves and continued family genealogies, etc., were all exposed by the poor peasants. This was a vivid class education course for me, making me see with my own eyes the sharp and complex nature of class struggle and further enhancing my class consciousness, deepening my understanding of Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle."

I and the poor peasants are like bitter gourds on the same vine. To remember class bitterness and cherish blood hatred, I asked those poor peasants with deep bitterness to tell me and the broad rural youth about their family histories and village histories. I received an extremely profound class education. The broad masses of poor peasants recalled their tragic past, contrasted it with today's happiness, and thus loved the Party, loved Chairman Mao, and loved socialism even more. They worked from dawn to dusk, fearing neither dirt nor hardship, wholeheartedly for the collective. A landlord's wife maliciously said to a poor peasant, "The garlic in your private plot is about to rot, and the wheat has fallen to the ground. Why don't you take care of it?" This landlord's wife thought she could touch the poor peasant's selfless red heart. But the peasant firmly said, "In the past, I did not work hard in the team, and when the production team's crops suffered losses, why didn't you care? Today, I did not take care of my private plot, and you are concerned about me. I think you are a weasel paying New Year's greetings to the chickens, with no good intentions."

Look, how firm the poor peasants are in taking the socialist path! China's Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism, promoted the "three selfs and one contract" in the countryside, advocating the development of "three horses, one plow, and one cart" style peasants, which has long been spit upon by the poor peasants!

I am of poor peasant origin, but I still had ideological struggles about participating in labor. This struggle was actually a struggle between proletarian and bourgeois ideologies. Take picking manure as an example. As soon as I picked up the manure basket, I had ideological struggles. I am a female comrade and a university graduate, fearing ridicule, feeling unnatural. My eyes were not focused on finding manure but on whether someone was coming. My feet were not directed towards places with manure but towards places with no one. This was actually the influence of bourgeois ideology. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works, my ideological problems were solved. When picking up the manure basket again, it became natural, and I picked more.

I felt that picking one more basket of manure touched my soul once more, fought my selfishness once more, and brought me one step closer to the thoughts and feelings of the working people.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords riding on the heads of the people. Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." Chairman Mao's teaching clearly shows that cadres participating in labor and intellectuals combining with workers and peasants is not a small matter but a major matter related to preventing and opposing revisionism, related to whether our country will change color. Many cadres who made mistakes in the countryside started by detaching from labor.

With my awareness raised, I followed Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely learned from the poor peasants, actively participated in production labor, fearing neither dirt nor hardship, and decided to temper myself. In spring, when planting trees on the mountain, I had to go down the mountain to fetch water, walking a long distance for a round trip. Carrying a bucket of water up the mountain made me breathless. My arthritis flared up, and at night, lying in bed, my legs ached like being stabbed with needles, making it hard to sleep. Comrades and villagers all advised me to rest. At this time, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "You want the masses to understand you, you want to blend with the masses, you must make a decision and go through long-term, even painful, tempering." Looking at some villagers who were very old but never rested, working year-round, I was so young, with a little pain in my body, what was that! So I insisted on working with the villagers. The villagers said, "This girl is really strong, working like a young man."

During the busy summer harvest and planting season, although I was sick, every day, in addition to working with the villagers, I also seized the gaps in labor to write propaganda materials, promoting the progress of summer harvest and planting work. One afternoon, the team leader assigned me to stay at home and organize materials for model villagers. As soon as I sat down, I felt dizzy, with stars in my eyes. The landlady saw my pale face and advised me to lie down and rest, but I insisted on continuing. However, my condition worsened, with a fever of forty degrees, vomiting and diarrhea, and finally collapsing in the toilet. Many poor peasants came to see me, and the landlady even helped me wash my dirty clothes. The concern of the poor peasants gave me great encouragement and motivation. As soon as the fever subsided, I insisted on working and threw myself into the hot struggle again.

In the issue of cultivating and educating the younger generation, there has always been a sharp class struggle. Great leader Chairman Mao teaches the youth to go to the hot struggles of the masses of workers and peasants, to experience storms and gain experience in struggles, and to take the path of combining with the masses of workers and peasants; while China's Khrushchev maliciously wants to lead the youth down the path of detaching from the masses of workers and peasants and "cultivating" themselves in seclusion. These are two diametrically opposed paths, one leading to communism and the other to restoring capitalism. I will resolutely and unshakably follow the bright path pointed out by Chairman Mao.

Forever march forward on the revolutionary course pointed out by Chairman Mao

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To learn Marxism, we must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the masses of workers and peasants, can we truly learn it." The practice of the Four Clean-ups movement, especially this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, made me deeply feel that: the process of combining with workers and peasants is the process of criticizing and repudiating oneself and revisionism, the process of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works to transform one's subjective world.

To transform one's worldview with Mao Zedong Thought, the most fundamental thing is to let the spirit of "publicness" take root in one's mind, to wholeheartedly serve the people, and to completely and thoroughly serve the people. Are you really wholeheartedly and completely serving the people? Or are you half-heartedly serving the people? In the process of combining with the masses of workers and peasants, you can get the best test.

One cold winter day, I heard that a sick poor peasant woman did not have a quilt to wear, and I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "serving the people," rushing to mend her quilt for her. But seeing the quilt was dirty and torn, and hearing she had a contagious disease, I had ideological struggles. At this time, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "selflessness" and "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and that to be extremely responsible for work and extremely enthusiastic for comrades and the people, I felt that not acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions was disloyal to Chairman Mao and that I could not master Mao Zedong Thought. Thinking this, I put aside all thoughts of dirt and contagious diseases. With the urgency of the poor peasants in my heart, I quickly mended the old woman's quilt. The old woman, wearing the newly mended quilt, with tears of excitement, said to me, "The PLA is so good, I will never forget you in my life!" After hearing this, my face felt hot, I should not accept the old woman's thanks, but should thank our beloved leader Chairman Mao. It was because of Chairman Mao's words that I did this.

On windy and snowy days, when the wind was biting, I saw that the grass on the roof of a difficult household was about to be blown away by the wind. At this time, the image of Jiao Yulu appeared before me. So I climbed onto the roof and used stones and tiles to secure the grass. I felt that to solve the difficulties of the masses, relying on myself was not enough. I organized the youth to learn Chairman Mao's teachings on "serving the people" and the deeds of heroes like Lei Feng and Wang Jie. The youth were all mobilized, eagerly doing good deeds for the difficult households.

Every time I followed Chairman Mao's teachings and did something for the poor peasants, I felt that I had shortened the distance with them, that I was advancing one step forward on the limitlessly loyal path to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

The People's Liberation Army is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. As an honorable soldier of the People's Liberation Army, I not only strive to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works but also strive to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses, mobilize the masses, and do a good job in production and work. I feel that propagating Mao Zedong Thought and leading the broad masses to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works is my duty that I cannot shirk. Caring for the masses politically is the greatest service to the people.

Every time I go to the countryside, I try every means to send Mao Zedong Thought to the hearts of the broad masses of villagers. When participating in the Four Clean-ups, I mobilized the masses to organize several study groups of Chairman Mao's works and helped them set up night schools and clubs, buying single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works to give to them. At that time, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" could not be distributed to everyone, so I printed them for the villagers. Whether in the fields, meeting rooms, or families, I propagated wherever I went. To promote the study of Chairman Mao's works, I timely compiled production and study good deeds into cultural materials for propaganda. Whether in severe winter or scorching summer, I went out with the local youth to put up blackboard newspapers. As long as it was about propagating Mao Zedong Thought, I was not afraid of fatigue and hunger, with endless energy.

Vice Chairman Lin said: "Chairman Mao's words have the highest level, the highest prestige, and the greatest power." He also said, "When the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they become the smartest and bravest, and can unleash boundless power!" Indeed, the broad masses of villagers, after studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," had a great change in their spiritual outlook. Everyone strove to learn from Zhang Side, White, and "Old Fool," and many new people and new deeds of public spirit emerged. In the past, some people, for more work points, only cared about quantity and ignored quality when working. After studying Chairman Mao's works, their awareness was raised, they worked more, the quality improved, and the phenomenon of working wholeheartedly for the collective increased. Mutual help, mutual care, the atmosphere of unity and progress became thicker day by day. Some villagers got up early to pick manure and secretly sent it to the team without asking for rewards; got up early to work for the team without asking for work points. Truly, people change their thoughts, the earth changes its clothes, the production outlook changes greatly, dry land becomes paddy fields, and grain production increases greatly. Later, this team was rated as one of the five good production teams in the commune.

In organizing and mobilizing the broad masses of villagers to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, I felt that the poor peasants had deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. They loved to read Chairman Mao's books the most and applied what they learned. They dared to expose their selfishness and dared to fight against it. The moving deeds of the broad masses of poor peasants in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works further inspired my awareness and enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works.

In the Cultural Revolution, the reason I could stand firm, not lose direction, resist the current, and overcome the waves was that I resolutely listened to Chairman Mao's words, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; at the same time, it was also because I firmly believed in the great truth of combining with workers and peasants pointed out by Chairman Mao and stood firmly with the broad revolutionary masses in the struggle. On this path pointed out by Chairman Mao, I have only just taken the first step. A longer journey and more arduous tempering lie ahead. I will forever march forward on the revolutionary course pointed out by Chairman Mao, study Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

　　听毛主席的话，坚决走和工农群众相结合的道路
　　防化学兵首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表　丁秀珍
    毛主席教导我们：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”毛主席为知识青年指出了一条实现思想革命化的唯一正确的光明大道。这是对青年的最大关怀，最大期望，最大鼓舞。
    几年来，特别是无产阶级文化大革命运动以来，我深深地体会到，知识分子和工农相结合，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要，是巩固无产阶级专政，使无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色的重要措施；是知识青年实现思想革命化的必由之路。
    知识分子改造的根本道路
    一九六四年，我大学毕业后，光荣地参加了中国人民解放军。当我一踏进这个毛泽东思想大学校，就觉得和原来的学校大不一样，感到格外温暖。
    到部队不久，党为了培养我尽快成长，让我到农村劳动锻炼和参加四清运动。当时我对和工农群众相结合的重大意义，对思想改造的迫切性都是认识不足的。我想，象我这样出身好的人下农村，这是贫下中农的女儿又回到父母身边了，和工农打成一片，根本不成问题。
      可是，我下去以后，事实上并不象我想象的那样简单。在斗争有反动言行的地主分子时，贫下中农个个都满怀刻骨仇恨，愤怒揭发，坚决斗争。而我对地主分子的仇恨却不如贫下中农那样深。我嘴里也说向贫下中农学习，心里却感到自己有文化，懂得事情多。这样，我就不知不觉地摆起一副教育别人的架子来，和群众讲起来没个完。可是社员们没等我讲完，有的就摇头，说听不懂。我和社员一起劳动，虽然鼓足劲干，但是干不了三天，就腰酸腿疼，躺在床上不想动弹。社员们说：“这些年轻学生，写写画画还行，叫他们抡镐头就稀松了。”劳动休息时，社员们有说有笑，我一去，他们的话就少了。和贫农老大娘睡在一个床上，大娘不让小孩贴近我，怕我嫌脏；和她在一个桌上吃饭，也尽让我吃好的细的，怕我吃不下粗的。
    这些情况说明什么呢？晚上我躺在床上翻来复去地想，头脑里出现了一连串的问号：我原是个贫农出身的人，为什么阶级立场没有贫下中农那么坚定？爱憎没有他们那么鲜明？我原是个农村土生土长的孩子，为什么贫下中农听不懂我的话？为什么说我抡镐头稀松？为什么对我那么照顾？我开始感觉到，我在思想上、感情上、生活上，已经和贫下中农有了一定的距离，我身上的贫下中农的本色，已经开始变了。记得在我上大学时，父亲曾叮嘱我：“咱家祖祖辈辈受剥削、受压迫，没有一个识字的。毛主席领导咱穷人翻了身，你这个女孩子才能上大学，你可别忘了咱穷人啊！”我想到自己忘了本，感到十分难过。
    可是，为什么在城市里上了几年学就和工农群众有了这么大的差距呢？过去，我虽然也感觉到学校的教学有问题，但是问题究竟在那里还搞不清楚。直到这次无产阶级文化大革命，才使我进一步认识到：罪魁祸首是中国赫鲁晓夫。中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线向青年灌输资产阶级思想，把青年引向脱离劳动、脱离实际、脱离工农群众、求名求利的资本主义的歧途。起初，我对于那些资产阶级的妖风臭气，还感到讨厌，思想上有所抵制，后来也渐渐习惯了。自己过去还没有觉察到已经受了资产阶级思想的腐蚀，直到下去和贫下中农一起生活以后，我才有所觉悟。我认识到，不彻底砸烂这条修正主义教育路线，不彻底肃清它的流毒，不坚决地听毛主席的话，走和工农群众相结合的道路，我们青年就会忘记阶级和阶级斗争，就会忘记无产阶级专政，就会变成资产阶级接班人。我深深地体会到，一个人的出身并不能决定他走什么样的道路，出身好的人，如果放松了思想改造，也会被资产阶级思想腐蚀，甚至陷入修正主义的泥坑。自己原来的“自来红”思想，是完全错误的。只有改造红，没有“自来红”。正如毛主席教导的：“不仅那些基本立场还没有转过来的人要改造，而且所有的人都应该学习，都应该改造。”“没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”这是千真万确的真理。我决心沿着毛主席指引的和工农群众相结合的这条光明大道走下去，尽快地缩短和贫下中农的距离，加强自己的思想改造。
    在群众斗争的实践中，经风雨见世面
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”我们要想做个无产阶级革命事业的接班人，要想在群众斗争中经风雨，见世面，就必须积极地投身到三大革命运动中去，投身到广大工农兵群众中去。
    我们接班，接什么班？归根到底就是接革命的班，接毛泽东思想的班。我体会到，不和工农群众相结合，就不可能接好这个班。广大工农群众最懂得阶级和阶级斗争，最懂得剥削和压迫。他们的阶级观点最明确，阶级立场最坚定，他们爱憎最分明，他们最懂得革命，最勇于革命。
    在农村参加四清时，我看到广大贫下中农始终站在斗争的最前列，他们对地富反坏斗争最积极。我一入村，一位苦大仇深的贫农社员就对我说：“我们这里地主不臭，贫农不香。”一句话就点破了这个村的阶级斗争情况。后来，这个社员揭发了地主分子的不少罪行。广大贫下中农在阶级斗争中，不怕地、富、反、坏分子威胁恫吓，也不被他们的花言巧语所迷惑。地主富农如何梦想“变天”，如何用金钱、美女、酒肉拉拢腐蚀干部；如何搞投机倒把；如何祭祖坟、续家谱，等等，都被贫下中农一一揭发出来了。这对我是一堂生动的阶级教育课，使我亲眼看到了阶级斗争的尖锐复杂，进一步提高了我的阶级觉悟，加深了对毛主席指示的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的认识。
    我和贫下中农是一根藤上的苦瓜。为了不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，我就请那些苦大仇深的老贫农，给我和广大农村青年讲家史、村史。我受到了极其深刻的阶级教育。广大贫下中农回忆悲惨的过去，对比今天的幸福，就更加热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义。他们起早贪黑地干活，不怕脏，不怕累，一心为集体。有个地主婆不怀好意地对一个贫农社员说：“你自留地里的蒜快烂掉头啦，麦子都掉了粒啦，你还不去管管？”这个地主婆，满以为这样可以打动这个贫农社员的公而忘私的一颗红心。可是，这个社员却斩钉截铁地说：“我过去少干队里的活，生产队的庄稼受损失时，你为什么不管？今天我没管自留地，你倒关心起我来了。我看你是黄鼠狼给鸡拜年，没安好心。”
    看，贫下中农对走社会主义道路是多么坚定！中国赫鲁晓夫为了复辟资本主义，在农村推行的“三自一包”，鼓吹发展“三马一犁一车”式农民，早已为贫下中农所唾弃！
    我是贫农出身的，但是对参加劳动还是有思想斗争的。这个斗争，实际上是无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的斗争。就拿拾粪来说吧。一背起粪筐，思想就有斗争。我是个女同志，又是个大学生，怕人家笑话，觉得不自然。我的眼睛不是专心找大粪，而是注意有没有人来，脚不是向有粪的地方去，而是朝着没有人的地方走。这实际上是资产阶级思想的影响。后来学习了毛主席著作，思想问题才解决了。再背起粪筐，也就自然了，拾得也多了。
    我体会到，多拾一筐粪，就多触及了一次灵魂，就多斗了一分私心，就和劳动人民的思想感情接近了一步。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”毛主席的这一教导，清楚地说明干部参加劳动，知识分子和工农相结合，不是件小事情，而是关系到防修反修的大事，是关系到我们国家是否改变颜色的大事。农村中犯错误的干部，不少是由脱离劳动开始的。
    认识提高了，我就遵照毛主席的教导，坚决向贫下中农学习，积极参加生产劳动，不怕脏，不怕累，下决心去磨练自己。春天，在山上栽树，要跑到山下去担水，来回一趟要走很远的路，一担水挑到山上就累得上气不接下气。我的关节炎发作了，晚上躺在床上，两腿疼得象针扎一样，睡不着觉，社员和同志们都劝我休息。这时，我想起了毛主席的教导：“你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”再看看有些社员年纪很大了，却从来不休息，成年累月地坚持出工。我这么年轻，身上有点疼痛，算得了什么！所以我就坚持和社员们一起出工。社员们说：“这姑娘真刚强，干活象个小伙子。”
    在夏收夏种大忙季节，我虽然有病，每天除和社员一起出工劳动外，还抓紧劳动空隙时间编写宣传材料，推动夏收夏种工作的进展。一天下午，队长分配我在家整理五好社员材料，刚坐下就觉得天旋地转，眼前直冒金花。房东大娘看我脸色苍白，劝我躺下休息，我坚持干下去。可是病情越来越重，发烧到四十度，上吐下泻，终于昏倒在厕所里。许多贫下中农都来看我，房东大娘还帮我洗了脏衣服。贫下中农的关怀，给了我极大的鞭策和鼓励。于是，刚一退烧，我就坚持出工，又投身到火热的斗争中去了。
    在培养和教育青年一代的问题上，一直存在着尖锐的阶级斗争。伟大领袖毛主席教导青年要到火热的工农群众的斗争中去，在斗争中经风雨见世面，走和工农群众相结合的道路；而中国赫鲁晓夫，却恶毒地要把青年引向脱离工农群众，闭门“修养”的歧途。这是两条截然相反的道路，一条是通往共产主义的道路，一条是复辟资本主义的道路，我一定坚定不移地走毛主席指出的这条光明大道。
    永远沿着毛主席指引的革命航道前进
    毛主席教导我们说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”四清运动，特别是这次无产阶级文化大革命运动的革命实践，使我深深地体会到：和工农结合的过程，是斗私批修的过程，是活学活用毛主席著作改造主观世界的过程。
    用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，最根本的就是让“公”字在头脑里扎根，全心全意地为人民服务，完全彻底地为人民服务。你究竟是全心全意地、完全彻底地为人民服务？还是半心半意地为人民服务？在和工农群众相结合的过程中，就能得到最好的检验。
    一个严冬腊月天，我听说一个生病的贫农大娘还没有棉衣穿，就想起了毛主席“为人民服务”的教导，急忙跑去为她缝补棉衣。可是一看棉衣又脏又破，又听说她患的是传染病，于是思想上就斗争起来。这时想起了毛主席的“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，想起了为人民服务要“完全”“彻底”，要对工作极端的负责任，对同志对人民极端的热忱，我感到不按毛主席指示办事就是对毛主席的不忠，就不可能把毛泽东思想学到手。想到这里，什么脏，什么传染病，一概置之脑后了。我怀着急贫下中农所急的心情，很快为老大娘补好了棉衣，大娘穿着新缝补的棉衣，含着激动的泪水，对我说：“解放军真好，我一辈子也忘不了你啊！”我听了之后，脸上热辣辣的，我不应该接受大娘的感谢，应该感谢我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，我是听了毛主席他老人家的话才这样做的。
    在风雪交加、寒风刺骨的日子里，我看到困难户房上的草快被风吹掉了。这时，焦裕禄的高大形象出现在我面前。于是我就爬到房顶上，用石头和瓦片把草压好。我感到要解决群众的困难，光靠自己是不行的。我就组织青年们学习毛主席“为人民服务”的教导，学习雷锋、王杰等英雄人物的事迹。青年们都发动起来了，争先为困难户做好事。
    我每当按照毛主席的教导，为贫下中农做了一件事以后，都感到和他们缩短了一段距离，都感到是在无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想的光辉道路上，向前跨进了一步。
    人民解放军是毛泽东思想的大学校。我是一个光荣的人民解放军战士，不仅我自己要努力活学活用毛主席著作，而且要努力宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想去武装群众、发动群众，搞好生产、搞好工作。我觉得宣传毛泽东思想，带动广大群众活学活用毛主席著作，是我义不容辞的政治任务，从政治上关心群众，就是最大的为人民服务。
    每次到农村，我都想尽一切办法把毛泽东思想送到广大社员心坎里。参加四清时，我发动群众组织了若干个学习毛主席著作小组，并帮助他们办起了民校、俱乐部，买毛主席著作单行本送给他们。当时《毛主席语录》还不能做到人手一册，我就给社员们刻印。不论在田间、会场或家庭，走到那里我就宣传到那里。为了推动毛主席著作学习，我就及时把生产中、学习上的好人好事编成文娱材料进行宣传。不论在严冬还是酷夏，我都同当地青年一起出黑板报。只要是宣传
  毛泽东思想的事，我就不怕什么疲劳和饥饿，浑身有使不完的劲。
    林副主席说：“毛主席的话，水平最高，威信最高，威力最大”。又说：“人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量！”的确如此。广大社员群众学习了“老三篇”，精神面貌发生了很大变化。个个争学张思德、白求恩、“老愚公”，出现了很多公而忘私的新人新事。过去，有的人为多挣工分，干活只求数量，不顾质量。学了毛主席著作以后，觉悟提高了，干活多了，质量好了，一心为集体的现象多了。互相帮助，互相关心，团结、进步的气氛一天天浓了。有的社员早起拾粪，偷偷送到队里，不计报酬；早起为队里干活，不要工分。真是人换思想地换装，生产面貌大变样，旱地变水田，粮食大增产。后来，这个队被评为公社五好生产队。
    在组织和发动广大社员群众活学活用毛主席著作中，我感到贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席有深厚的阶级感情，他们最爱读毛主席的书，而且学了就用。他们最敢于亮私、敢于斗私。广大贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作的动人事迹，更激发了我学习毛主席著作的自觉性和积极性。
    在文化大革命运动中，我所以能够站稳立场，不迷方向，顶住逆流，战胜恶浪，是由于我坚决听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署；同时也是由于我坚信毛主席指引的和工农相结合的伟大真理，在斗争中坚决和广大的革命群众站到了一边。我在毛主席指引的这条大道上，还只是刚刚迈开第一步。更长远的路程，更艰苦的磨练，还在后面。我要永远沿着毛主席指引的革命航道一直走下去，一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。（附图片）
