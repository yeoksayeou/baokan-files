	The brave people of various places in the liberated areas of Laos not only defeated the "encroachment" attacks of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in the military field over the past year but also overcame the wanton destruction of U.S. warplanes. In the agricultural front, they have achieved tremendous successes. Farmers in various liberated areas have displayed a spirit of fortitude and bravery, producing while fighting, and the agricultural production in the liberated areas has flourished.

	The Lao Patriotic Front attaches great importance to the development of agriculture. Over the past year, it has trained a large number of agricultural and water conservancy cadres for various places. Just in Xieng Khouang Province, more than 360 cadres have been trained.

	Over the past year, the water conservancy industry in the liberated areas has developed rapidly. Farmers in Xieng Khouang Province have built 55 water conservancy projects, which can irrigate about 1,000 hectares of farmland. According to statistics, so far, farmers in various liberated areas have built a total of 168 medium and small water conservancy projects. Just in Xam Neua Province, 31 water conservancy projects have been completed, which can irrigate half of the farmland in the entire province.

	The development of water conservancy has promoted the development of agricultural production. Over the past year, the cultivated area in various liberated areas has been expanding day by day. The land that was abandoned due to enemy bombing has now been planted with crops, and many wastelands have also been reclaimed. Khammouane Province is the place that has suffered the most barbaric bombing by U.S. warplanes, but local farmers have still managed to plant all their farmland with crops in every possible way.

	Over the past year, the production of early and late rice in the liberated areas of Laos has been bountiful. A few years ago, the first experimental plot of early rice was started in Ban Koun, Khoun District, Xieng Khouang Province. Now it has been widely promoted in the liberated areas, forming an early rice production movement, and producing a large amount of grain for the cause of resisting the Americans and saving the nation.

	Cadres of various agencies and military units in the liberated areas have displayed a spirit of self-reliance, producing grain by themselves. Cadres and military units in the southern region have made use of their spare time and intervals between battles to persist in production. After a year of hard work, they have harvested more than 750 tons of paddy, greatly reducing the burden on the state and the people.

    培训干部　大兴水利　扩大耕地
    老挝解放区农业生产欣欣向荣
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：英勇的老挝解放区各地人民，在过去一年中不但在军事上挫败了美帝国主义及其走狗的“蚕食”进攻，而且战胜了美国强盗飞机的疯狂破坏，在农业战线上取得了巨大的成绩。解放区各地农民发扬坚强勇敢的精神，边生产、边战斗，解放区的农业生产蓬勃发展。
    老挝爱国战线党十分关心农业的发展，一年来为各地培养了大批农业和水利干部，仅桑怒省就培养了三百六十多名。
    过去一年中，解放区的水利事业获得了大力发展。桑怒省农民兴修了五十五项水利工程，可引水灌溉农田约一千公顷。据统计，到目前为止，解放区各地农民共兴建了中、小型水利工程一百六十八项。仅川圹省就完成了三十一项水利工程，可以引水灌溉全省二分之一的耕地。
    水利的发展推动了农业生产的发展。一年来各地解放区的耕作面积日益扩大。过去由于敌机狂轰滥炸而丢荒的土地，现在都种上了庄稼，并且还开垦了许多荒地。甘蒙省是遭到美国强盗飞机最野蛮的轰炸的地方，但当地农民仍千方百计地把全部耕地种上作物。
    在过去的一年中，老挝解放区的早稻和晚稻生产都获得了好收成。几年前，在桑怒省川库县川昆乡开始种第一块早稻试验田，现在已经在解放区广泛推广，形成一个早稻生产运动，为抗美救国事业增产大量的粮食。
    解放区各机关干部和部队单位发扬自力更生精神，自己动手生产粮食。下寮地区的干部和部队，利用业余时间和战斗间隙，坚持生产，经过一年的辛勤劳动，收获了七百五十多吨稻谷，大大地减轻了国家和人民的负担。
