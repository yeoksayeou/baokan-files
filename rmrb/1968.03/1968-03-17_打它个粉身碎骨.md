Our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force, after achieving a series of brilliant victories, remains humble and unyielding, continuing to strive forward. On March 15, they struck down another U.S. imperialist unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft that had intruded into our airspace. This is another triumph of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We extend our warmest congratulations to the Air Force, which has repeatedly achieved great feats.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary forces, when they are on the verge of extinction, will always make desperate struggles."

The U.S. aggressors, who have been beaten to a pulp by the Vietnamese military and people, see that the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is awakening revolutionary people all over the world. They instinctively sense their own doom approaching and, in their desperation, are making more frenzied struggles, repeatedly sending planes to provoke us.

The People's Liberation Army Air Force and Naval Air Force, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, take Comrade Lin Biao as their example, earnestly study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote preparedness for war," maintain constant vigilance, and fight bravely. In just two and a half months, they have achieved four consecutive victories in shooting down U.S. aggressor planes.

This once again shows that the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is a great wall of steel, on high alert against imperialist aggression.

We sternly warn the U.S. imperialist aggressors: Our airspace is sacred and inviolable. We will surely punish any invading enemy, smashing them to pieces.

Comrades of the entire People's Liberation Army, the more victorious we are, the more vigilant we must be. We must strengthen our preparedness for war, be ready at any moment to smash the new provocations of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, defend the great leader Chairman Mao, defend the great socialist motherland, and defend the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　打它个粉身碎骨
　　本报评论员
    我英雄的人民解放军空军部队，在取得了一系列辉煌胜利之后，不骄不躁，再接再厉，于三月十五日，又击落侵入我国领空的美帝军用无人驾驶高空侦察机一架。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利。我们谨向屡建功勋的空军部队，表示最热烈的祝贺。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”
    被越南军民打得焦头烂额的美国强盗，眼看到我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利正在激醒全世界的革命人民，他们本能地预感到自己末日的来临，因而更加疯狂地进行绝望的挣扎，一再派飞机对我进行挑衅。
    我人民解放军空军部队和海军航空兵部队，怀着无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席的最深厚的无产阶级感情，以林副统帅为榜样，认真地活学活用毛泽东思想，贯彻执行毛主席关于抓革命、促战备的方针，常备不懈，英勇战斗，在两个半月的时间里，连续四次获得击落美国强盗飞机的巨大胜利。
    这再一次表明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军，是坚如钢铁的伟大长城，对帝国主义的侵略，是有高度戒备的。
    我们严厉警告美帝国主义强盗，我国的领空是神圣不可侵犯的，对来犯的敌人，我们一定严惩不贷，打它个粉身碎骨。
    人民解放军的全体指战员同志们，越是在胜利的时候，越要百倍警惕，加强战备，时刻准备粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗新的挑衅，保卫伟大的领袖毛主席，保卫伟大的社会主义祖国，保卫伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。
