The invincible thought of Mao Zedong has achieved a new victory on the scientific and technological front. China has found a way to prevent potato degeneration. The revolutionary workers and scientific workers of the Institute of Genetics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, have concentrated the wisdom and experience of the masses and, through trials and promotion, have achieved remarkable results.

Xinhua News Agency, March 11 -- The potato degeneration problem, which has long been considered difficult to solve in domestic and international agricultural production, has been addressed in China. The revolutionary workers and scientific workers of the Institute of Genetics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as agricultural technicians from various production departments, have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "practice, cognition, more practice, more cognition." In recent years, they have gone deep into the masses, learned from the masses, systematically studied and summarized the rich experiences of Chinese farmers in preventing potato degeneration, and conducted trials and promotions in many regions, achieving remarkable results. In the future, with further extensive trials and promotions, this scientific research achievement will surely be further developed and improved.

Potatoes are a high-yielding grain crop and also an excellent vegetable for the off-season market. However, this crop generally has high yields in the first year of planting, a significant drop in the second year, and by the third year, it basically loses its value as seed. The degeneration of potatoes is a problem encountered in potato-growing regions around the world and has been a topic of discussion and research by scientists for over a century. Various scholars have different explanations for the degeneration of potatoes, but none have solved the practical problems of production. For many years, in the vast central region of China, due to the degeneration of seed potatoes, it has not been possible to retain seeds locally, and every year, seed potatoes have to be transported from the cold regions of Northeast China, making it difficult to further expand the planting area of this short-growing, high-yielding crop.

Since 1954, and especially since 1960, the scientific workers of the Institute of Genetics have begun to study this urgent problem in production. Initially, they were influenced by the poisonous line of anti-revolutionary revisionism promoted by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the scientific and technological community, attempting to solve China's problems using materials recorded in foreign literature. They took what was supposedly the "essence" from foreign literature, pieced it together, and conducted repeated experiments, only to find that these explanations could not solve the practical problems of production. Later, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "Oppose Bookishness," followed Chairman Mao's teachings on linking theory with practice, going to the masses, and learning from the masses, and walked out of the laboratory. They went to many provinces and autonomous regions, including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, Shandong, and Inner Mongolia, to conduct extensive investigations and research on the degeneration of potatoes, collecting many valuable experiences of Chinese farmers in solving the degeneration of potatoes. They then systematically summarized these experiences and, through scientific experiments, conducted theoretical analyses, believing that the degeneration of potatoes is greatly related to the characteristics of the variety, and whether it degenerates or not is also controlled by environmental conditions. Therefore, in the vast rural areas of China, it is possible to prevent the degeneration of potatoes by cultivating varieties suitable for local cultivation according to local conditions and adopting corresponding cultivation methods for different varieties. The scientific workers of the Institute of Genetics cooperated with the scientific and technological departments, agricultural departments, and other units such as the Agricultural College of Shandong Province to summarize, experiment, and promote the rich experiences of farmers in preventing the degeneration of potatoes. Currently, in Beijing, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Liaodong, Jinan, Yantai, Teng County of Shandong, Jieshou of Anhui, Lianyungang of Jiangsu, and Ba County of Hebei, the use of some early-maturing, high-yielding, and anti-degeneration varieties and the cultivation method of autumn sowing with two seasons have basically made the seed potatoes not degenerate, solving the problem of local seed retention. The autumn sowing with two seasons cultivation method currently used in the central region of China has developed considerably. After the scientific workers of the Institute of Genetics summarized the experiences of farmers in various places in solving the degeneration of potatoes, they proposed a set of ideas for solving the degeneration of potatoes based on the different natural conditions in various regions of China, preparing to submit them to relevant scientific research units and production departments for joint experiments, and to prepare for large-scale promotion in China.

The work of summarizing the experiences of farmers in solving the degeneration of potatoes by the revolutionary scientific workers of the Institute of Genetics was carried out in the midst of a fierce struggle between the two lines. In the process of following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, going deep into the masses, and conducting this research work, they were subjected to various rejections and attacks by a small handful of capitalist roaders within the Academy of Sciences. This small handful of capitalist roaders within the party crazily promoted the anti-revolutionary revisionist research line, doing everything possible to oppose this work. They worshipped foreigners and despised the masses' practice, saying, "Summarizing the experiences of the masses, summarizing and summarizing, it's still the farmers' way, there's nothing new." In addition to setting up numerous obstacles in terms of manpower and resources, they sometimes even obstructed the contact between the scientific workers engaged in this work and the relevant production departments and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. All this did not frighten the scientific workers armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. They started from the urgent needs of the broad masses of farmers and the urgent needs of agricultural production, closely united with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and conducted experiments together in the production teams of the people's communes. They humbly learned from the masses. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses of proletarians, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, seized power from a small handful of capitalist roaders within the party, thoroughly exposed and criticized the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Academy of Sciences in promoting the anti-revolutionary revisionist research line. This research work also turned over a new leaf. The scientific workers engaged in this work, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, grasped revolution and promoted production, took "The Outline for Agricultural Development" as the guideline, and together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the comrades in the agricultural production departments, conducted summarization, experimentation, and promotion, finally finding a way to solve the potato degeneration problem, which has been considered a difficult problem by domestic and foreign scientific workers. This is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Chinese working people and scientific and technological personnel, and another victory of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong on the scientific and technological front.

　　战无不胜的毛泽东思想在科学技术战线上的新胜利
　　我国找到防止马铃薯退化的途径
    马铃薯退化现象，是各国科学家长期没有解决的问题。中国科学院遗传研究所革命工人和革命科学工作者集中了群众的智慧和经验，经过试验推广，取得显著成效
    新华社十一日讯　国内外农业生产上长期以来被认为是难以解决的马铃薯退化问题，在我国已经找到了解决的途径。中国科学院遗传研究所的革命工人和革命科学工作者，以及各地生产部门的农业技术人员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”的教导，近几年来深入群众，向群众学习，系统地研究总结了我国农民防止马铃薯退化的丰富经验，并在许多地区进行了试验推广，取得了显著成效。在今后进一步的广泛试验推广中，这项科学研究成果必将进一步发展提高。
    马铃薯是一种高产的粮食作物，又是淡季供应市场的优良菜种。但是，这种作物在一般情况下调种当年产量高，第二年产量就大幅度下降，第三年就基本上失去了作种的价值。马铃薯的这种退化现象，是世界各国种植马铃薯地区普遍遇到的问题，也是各国科学家百余年来一直在探讨解决的问题。各国学者关于马铃薯退化的现象，有各种各样的解释，但是都没有解决生产上的实际问题。多年来，我国中原广大地区因为种薯退化，不能就地留种，每年都要去东北的冷凉地区调运种薯，使得这种生长期短、产量高的作物种植面积一直不能更加扩大。
    从一九五四年以来，特别是一九六○年以后，遗传研究所的科学工作者，开始研究这个生产上迫切需要解决的课题。最初他们由于受到中国赫鲁晓夫及其在科学技术界代理人推行的反革命修正主义科研路线的毒害，曾经试图用外国文献上记载的材料来解决我国的问题。他们把外国文献上所谓“精华”的东西，拿来捏在一起，进行重复试验，结果证明这些说法都不能解决生产实际问题。后来他们反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《反对本本主义》，遵照毛主席关于理论联系实际、到群众中去、向群众学习的教导，走出实验室，先后到黑龙江、辽宁、河北、山西、河南、安徽、山东、内蒙古等许多省和自治区的广大农村，拜贫下中农为师，就马铃薯退化问题进行了广泛的调查研究，搜集到了我国广大农民解决马铃薯退化问题的不少宝贵经验，然后对这些经验进行了系统的总结，并通过科学实验，进行了理论上的分析，认为马铃薯的退化与品种的特性有很大关系，退化与否又受环境条件的支配。因此，在幅员辽阔的我国广大农村，因地制宜地培育适于当地栽培的品种，并根据不同的品种采取相应的栽培方法，就可以防止马铃薯退化。遗传研究所科学工作者同河南郑州市和安徽界首的科学技术部门、农业部门以及山东省农学院等单位的科学技术工作人员大力协作，对农民创造的防止马铃薯退化的丰富经验，边总结边试验边推广。现在，北京、天津、郑州、旅大、济南、烟台、山东滕县、安徽界首、江苏连云港、河北霸县等地采用一些早熟、丰产、抗退化的品种和催芽秋播二季作的栽培方法，已能基本上使种薯不退化，解决了就地留种的问题。我国中原地区采用的催芽秋播二季作栽培方法，目前已有相当发展。遗传研究所的科学工作者对各地农民解决马铃薯退化问题的经验进行了科学总结以后，根据我国不同地区的自然条件，提出了一套解决马铃薯退化问题的设想，准备提交各地有关科学研究单位和生产部门共同试验，为在我国大面积推广作好准备。
    遗传研究所革命的科学工作者总结农民解决马铃薯退化经验的工作，是在两条路线的激烈斗争中进行的。革命的科学工作者在遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，深入群众，深入实际，进行这项研究工作的过程中，曾遭到了科学院党内一小撮走资派的种种排斥和打击。党内一小撮走资派疯狂推行反革命修正主义科研路线，千方百计地反对进行这项工作，他们迷信洋人，轻视群众实践，胡说什么：“总结群众经验，总结来总结去，还是农民的一套，没有什么新东西。”党内一小撮走资派除了在人力、物力上设置重重障碍外，有时甚至阻挠从事这项工作的科学工作者同有关生产部门和广大贫下中农的联系。所有这些，都没有吓倒用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的科学工作者，他们从广大农民的迫切需要出发，从农业生产的迫切需要出发，和广大贫下中农紧密结合，共同在人民公社生产队进行试验，虚心向群众学习。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大无产阶级革命派在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，彻底揭发批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在科学院代理人推行反革命修正主义科研路线的罪行，这项研究工作也翻了身。从事这项工作的科学工作者，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，抓革命、促生产，以“农业发展纲要”为指针，同广大贫下中农和农业生产部门的同志一起进行总结试验和推广，终于找到了解决马铃薯退化这个被国内外科学工作者认为是老大难问题的途径。这是我国劳动人民同科学技术人员集体智慧的结晶，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想在科学技术战线上的又一胜利。
