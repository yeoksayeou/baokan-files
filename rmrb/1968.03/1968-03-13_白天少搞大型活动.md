Spring production must be grasped with a spirit of "seizing the day." During the busy spring planting season, the time of the commune members is extremely precious, and it is generally not advisable to organize large-scale meetings, parades, and other activities during the day. Some units in our county have not paid enough attention to this issue. The other day, a commune in our county organized more than a thousand commune members to deliver a congratulatory letter to a unit more than fifty miles away, taking two days round trip, not only delaying production but also not in line with the principle of thrift in revolution. In addition, some factories and offices in the city, whenever it is Sunday, drive down to the countryside to celebrate with poor and lower-middle peasants, sometimes even performing plays during the day, attracting many commune members working in the fields. These activities are good in nature, but occupying daytime during the spring planting season will affect production. It is hoped that relevant units will pay attention to this issue when arranging activities.

    白天少搞大型活动
    春耕生产必须以“只争朝夕”的精神抓紧抓好。在春耕大忙时，社员的时间非常宝贵，一般不宜在白天组织大型的集会、游行等活动。我县有些单位，对这个问题还没有引起足够的重视。前几天，我县有个公社竟组织了千余名社员去给相隔五十多里的某单位送贺信，往返两天，不仅耽误生产，也不符合节约闹革命的原则。此外，城里有些工厂和机关的群众组织，每逢星期天，就开着汽车下乡去和贫下中农联欢，有时还下去白天演戏，吸引了许多在田间劳动的社员。本来这些活动是好事，但是在春耕季节占用白天时间，就会影响生产。希望有关单位在安排活动时，注意这个问题。
