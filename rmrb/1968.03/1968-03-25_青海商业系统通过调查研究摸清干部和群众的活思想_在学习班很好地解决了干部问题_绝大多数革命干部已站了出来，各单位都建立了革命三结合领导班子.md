The Qinghai Commercial System has conducted investigations and research to understand the dynamic thoughts of cadres and the masses. Through study classes, they have effectively resolved cadre issues. The vast majority of revolutionary cadres have stepped forward, and each unit has established revolutionary three-in-one leadership teams.

	The Qinghai Commercial System's study classes on Mao Zedong Thought have learned from the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army. By addressing dynamic thoughts and conducting in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, they have resolved cadre issues. Five sessions of the study classes have been held, and many issues that were not resolved in the original units have been addressed in the study classes, greatly promoting the three-in-one leadership in various units.

	After the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Qinghai Commercial System took power, the work of liberating cadres progressed relatively quickly. However, they encountered many obstacles. Some revolutionary masses did not understand certain leading cadres and held grudges; some leading cadres themselves lacked the confidence to step forward and could not deeply recognize and examine their mistakes. Facing this situation, the responsible comrades of the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction Joint Committee of the Commercial System, together with the PLA's support-left comrades, conducted a serious study and believed that the cadres in this system were mostly good or relatively good. They should create conditions to allow more leading cadres to step forward. Therefore, they decided to establish study classes on Mao Zedong Thought to address the difficult issues in cadre work.

	To understand the dynamic thoughts of cadres and the masses, the study classes, before starting, sent people to conduct investigations and research in various units: Why can't certain leading cadres step forward? How do the revolutionary masses view them? What is the focal point of the problem? Which side is the main aspect of the contradiction? Through investigation and analysis, they started from the perspective of facilitating ideological mutual assistance and solving practical problems, deciding who to select for study, how to form classes and groups, and arranging mutual assistance partners.

	Under the specific guidance of the PLA support-left comrades, this study class adopted many lively and engaging methods, making the ideological and political work deep and detailed. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the brilliant works of the "Three Articles," organized "thought mutual assistance groups" of three to five people for heart-to-heart talks, held remembrance and reflection meetings, conducted self-criticism and rectification meetings, organized students to return to their original units for communication, invited revolutionary masses from various units to the class for discussions, and so on. Some leading cadres who had committed serious errors raised their consciousness during the study, correctly understood themselves, the revolutionary masses, and the mass movement after recognizing their errors, and the study class arranged for them to make deep self-criticisms to their unit's masses, helping them to quickly gain the understanding and trust of the revolutionary masses. This series of activities brought a strong atmosphere of ideological mutual assistance and self-criticism to the study class, creating good conditions for resolving cadre issues, and also expanding the influence of the study class to all units in the system, making the class inside and outside mutually combined and mutually promoting.

	In one unit, a leading cadre had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the revolutionary masses had significant opinions about him. He himself thought that he had a good background and had done some beneficial work for the people, carrying a burden, and thus could not correctly recognize the seriousness of the errors he had made. As a result, the distance between him and the revolutionary masses grew wider. Later, both this leading cadre and the responsible comrade of the revolutionary mass organization entered the study class. The study class put them in the same "thought mutual assistance group," studying Chairman Mao's works together, comparing Mao Zedong Thought with their own thoughts, and identifying which of their ideas and actions did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. The responsible comrade of the revolutionary mass organization examined his own focus only on the leading cadre's implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line, not seeing the cadre's entire history and work, thus only criticizing without helping, lacking the willingness to unite. This was contrary to Chairman Mao's cadre policy. In the future, they must follow Chairman Mao's method of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to help leading cadres recognize and correct their errors and stand tall to do revolution. That leading cadre also deeply examined his own "relying on past merits" mentality and his wrong attitude towards the mass movement, determined to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After they both spoke at the self-criticism and rectification meeting, the study class took the work directly to the original unit. On one hand, it let the responsible comrade of the revolutionary mass organization return to the unit to discuss learning gains and how to correctly treat cadres according to Mao Zedong Thought; on the other hand, it mobilized that leading cadre to make a self-criticism at the unit's mass meeting. The activities arranged by the study class had a good effect, and that leading cadre soon gained the understanding and trust of the masses. After liberating the cadre, the unit quickly established a three-in-one leadership team.

	This study class also paid great attention to consolidating the learning effects, striving to thoroughly resolve issues. After each session of the study class, the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction Joint Committee of the Commercial System and the PLA support-left comrades would collect feedback, understand the effects, learn from experiences and lessons, and make the next session better. If they found that some issues were not thoroughly resolved or relapsed, they would continue to do ideological and political work with a sense of responsibility. In one unit, the responsible comrade of the revolutionary mass organization had a correct understanding of liberating the unit's leading cadre during the study, but after returning to the unit and hearing someone comment on him, he wavered again. After learning about this situation, the study class sent someone to have a heart-to-heart talk with him, encouraging him to insist on acting according to Mao Zedong Thought. He finally stood firm and resolutely supported that leading cadre to step forward.

	Now, the various units under the Commercial System have all established three-in-one revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups, achieving a red tide throughout the system. The revolutionary leading cadres who should step forward have basically all done so.

    青海商业系统通过调查研究摸清干部和群众的活思想
    在学习班很好地解决了干部问题
    绝大多数革命干部已站了出来，各单位都建立了革命三结合领导班子
    本报讯　青海省商业系统的毛泽东思想学习班，学习人民解放军的政治工作经验，通过抓活的思想，做深入细致的思想政治工作来解决干部问题。学习班已经办了五期，许多在原单位没有解决的问题，在学习班里得到了解决，大大促进了各单位的革命三结合。
    青海省商业系统的无产阶级革命派掌权以后，解放干部的工作进展较快。但是在工作中遇到不少阻力。有些革命群众对某些领导干部不谅解，揪住不放；一些领导干部自己也缺乏站出来的信心，不能深刻认识和检查错误。针对这种情况，商业系统无产阶级革命派联合委员会负责人同解放军支左同志作了认真的研究，认为本系统的干部绝大多数是好的和比较好的，应该创造条件让更多的领导干部站出来。因此，他们决定开办毛泽东思想学习班，把干部工作中的难题拿到学习班里来解决。
    为了摸清干部和群众的活思想，学习班在开学前，派人深入到各单位调查研究：为什么某些领导干部还站不出来？革命群众对他们是怎么看的？问题的焦点在那里？那一方面是矛盾的主要方面？通过调查和分析，他们从有利于开展思想互助和解决实际问题出发，商定抽调那些人来学习，怎样编班分组，安排互助对象。
    在解放军支左同志的具体帮助下，这个学习班采用了许多生动活泼的方法，使思想政治工作做得又深又细。他们认真学习毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”等光辉著作，还组织三五个人为一组的“思想互助组”，开展谈心活动，召开忆苦思甜会，斗私批修讲用会，组织学员回本单位串连，请各单位的革命群众到班里来座谈，等等。有的犯有严重错误的领导干部在学习中提高了觉悟，对待自己、对待革命群众和群众运动有了正确的认识以后，学习班便安排他们向本单位的群众作深刻检查，帮助他们较快地取得革命群众的谅解和信任。这一系列的活动，给学习班带来了浓厚的思想互助、自我批评气氛，为解决好干部问题创造了良好的条件，也使学习班的影响扩大到全系统各单位，使得班内班外互相结合，互相促进。
    有个单位的领导干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中执行过资产阶级反动路线，革命群众对他有较大的意见。他本人却认为自己出身好，过去做过一些对人民有益的工作，背了包袱，因而不能正确认识所犯错误的严重性。这样，他同革命群众的距离越来越远。后来这位领导干部和革命群众组织负责人都进了学习班，学习班就把他们编在一个“思想互助组”里，一起学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想和自己的思想实际相对照，看自己那些想法做法不符合毛泽东思想。革命群众组织负责人检查了只看到领导干部执行过资产阶级反动路线，没看到他的全部历史和全部工作，因而对他只批不帮，缺乏团结的愿望。这是违反毛主席的干部政策的。今后，一定要按照毛主席提出的“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方法，来帮助领导干部认识错误，改正错误，挺起腰杆干革命。那位领导干部也深刻检查了自己“吃老本”的思想和对待群众运动的错误态度，决心回到毛主席的革命路线上来。他们两人在斗私批修讲用会上发言后，学习班又把工作直接做到原单位去。一方面，让革命群众组织负责人回本单位向革命群众谈学习收获，谈应该如何按照毛泽东思想正确对待干部；一方面，动员那位领导干部到本单位的群众大会上去作检查。学习班安排的这些活动起了很好的作用，这位领导干部不久就取得了群众的谅解和信任。这个单位解放了干部后，三结合的领导班子很快就建立起来。
    这个学习班还十分注意巩固学习的效果，力求彻底解决问题。每一期学习班办完之后，商业系统无产阶级革命派联合委员会和解放军支左同志都重视收集反映，了解效果，吸取经验教训，使下一期学习班办得更好。如果发现有些问题解决不彻底，或者出现反复，他们都本着负责到底的精神，继续做思想政治工作。有个单位的革命群众组织负责人，在学习时对解放本单位的领导干部有了正确的认识，但在回到本单位后听到有人议论他，又动摇起来了。学习班了解了这个情况后，便派人同他谈心，鼓励他坚持按照毛泽东思想办事。他终于站稳了立场，坚定地支持那位领导干部站出来。
    现在，商业系统所属的各个单位，都已经建立了三结合的革命委员会或者革命领导小组，实现了全系统一片红，应该站出来的革命领导干部，基本上都已经站了出来。
