	Intensify the Study of Mao Zedong Thought, Criticize and Repudiate Private and Revisionist Tendencies, and Eliminate Bourgeois and Petty-Bourgeois Factionalism
	Nanjing Speeds Up the Pace of Revolutionary Great Unity

	Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Under the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses in Nanjing have established numerous study classes of Mao Zedong Thought. They are earnestly studying and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promoting the rapid development of revolutionary great unity.

	So far, factories, schools, government agencies, streets, and suburban people's communes in the entire city have held more than 8,000 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 300,000 participants.

	In the study classes, the broad revolutionary masses have extensively studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they have criticized and repudiated private and revisionist tendencies, surrounded and eliminated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and greatly accelerated the pace of revolutionary great unity. Many study classes, with the help of the army, have taken Comrade Li Wenzhong, a model of supporting the left and loving the people, as an example, establishing a revolutionary learning style. The revolutionary masses have studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, doing as Chairman Mao instructs and advancing as Chairman Mao directs. After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," the two revolutionary factions of the Nanjing Chemical Fertilizer Factory held activities to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, greatly raising their class consciousness. They said, "In the old society, we were all oppressed and exploited class brothers. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the sea of suffering and helped us stand up. Today, we have a common enemy and a common revolutionary goal. We have a thousand reasons and ten thousand reasons to unite, and no reason to split." The revolutionary workers of this factory used various forms to list the crimes of factionalism, discuss the harm of factionalism, and dig out the roots of factionalism, launching a total attack on factionalism. Now, the entire factory has achieved revolutionary great unity and established a Revolutionary Great Unity Committee in late February. The representatives of the two factions in the Sand Wheel Factory, Smelting and Repair Factory, and Sanatorium in Yu Hua District sat on the same bench without speaking and stayed in the same room without talking when they first entered the study class. After studying, the representatives of the two factions eliminated their differences, strengthened their unity, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. Before and after the Spring Festival, all 49 primary schools in Zunyi District achieved revolutionary great unity through intensive study classes. The tide of revolutionary great unity in other districts is surging forward like a river, advancing by leaps and bounds.

　　大办毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，搞臭资产阶级、小资产阶级派性
　　南京大大加快革命大联合的步伐
    新华社南京电　南京市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在人民解放军的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习、坚决落实毛主席的最新指示，推动革命大联合迅速发展。
    到目前为止，全市工厂、学校、机关、街道和郊区人民公社已经举办了八千多个各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的达三十多万人。
    广大革命群众在学习班里，大学大用毛主席的最新指示，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，大大加快了革命大联合的步伐。许多学习班在解放军的帮助下，以“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志为榜样，树立起革命好学风，革命群众对毛主席的最新指示，学了就用，做到“毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”南京化肥厂两派革命职工在学习班里学习了毛主席关于“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的教导以后，开展了忆苦思甜活动，阶级觉悟大大提高。他们说，在旧社会我们都是受压迫、受剥削的阶级兄弟，是毛主席把我们救出苦海，翻身作了主人。今天我们有共同的敌人，有共同的革命目标，我们有一千条理由一万条理由联合起来，没有半点理由分裂下去。这个厂的革命职工，利用各种形式大列派性的罪状，大谈派性的危害，大挖派性的老根，向派性发起了一场总攻击。现在全厂已经实现了革命的大联合，在二月下旬成立了革命大联合委员会。雨花区的砂轮厂、冶修厂、疗养所等单位的两派代表，刚进学习班时，情绪对立，同坐一条板凳不说话，同住一个房间不搭腔。经过学习，两派代表消除了分歧，增强了团结，迅速实现了革命大联合。遵义区的四十九所小学春节前后经过大办学习班，全部实现了革命大联合。其他各区革命大联合的浪潮，也如江河奔腾，一日千里，不断向前发展。
