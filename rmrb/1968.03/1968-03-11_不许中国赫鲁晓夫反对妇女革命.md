Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "When all Chinese women rise up, that will be the day of victory for the Chinese revolution." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, millions of working women in the countryside and cities have actively participated in the revolutionary struggle and made significant contributions. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, who always wants to restore capitalism, never allows women to revolt and opposes women taking the socialist path. He blathers on: "Generally, female comrades without children are impossible. Those who want to do something in the Party should not marry, nor do we oppose having affairs. If you want to marry, you must make a decision, face the inevitability, and either decide to raise children, or do not think about any great future." According to the Chinese Khrushchev, women have two paths: one is to marry, raise children, and become slaves of the family; the other is to not marry, not raise children, and pursue personal "great futures." In reality, both paths mean not revolting.

We strongly detest and despise the Chinese Khrushchev's black words. We, the women of New China armed with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution.

Countless facts have refuted the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacies.

Take our Beijing Knitting Mill as an example. Female workers make up 57% of the entire workforce, and many of them are married with children. They are not only a crucial force in production but also fight shoulder to shoulder with male workers in revolutionary movements without falling behind. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, female workers have maintained production while actively participating in the struggle. Many mothers with several children do not go home after work but stay to fight alongside everyone else to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many female workers participate in revolutionary activities at night and still go to work the next day. With the help of the support-left personnel from the 8341 unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the factory, all workers in the factory have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, achieving great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have also completed the 1967 annual production tasks 22 days ahead of schedule, significantly improving product quality, reducing defective products, and solving some long-standing technical issues. We have successfully created whole ironing machines, fabric inspection machines, packaging machines, and more, greatly saving labor, reducing labor intensity, and increasing labor productivity.

We working women are a crucial force in seizing the revolution and promoting production. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to confine us to the small world of the family, making us "good wives and mothers," focusing on housework, and not involving ourselves in politics, so that the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party can overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. This will absolutely not happen! Chairman Mao teaches us: "Chinese women are a great human resource. We must tap into this resource and strive to build a great socialist country." We workers have suffered endless oppression and exploitation in the old society. It is Chairman Mao who saved us from the sea of suffering. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and contribute our strength to the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

We must wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly smash the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line on women's movements. (Accompanying photo)

### 不许中国赫鲁晓夫反对妇女革命

　　不许中国赫鲁晓夫反对妇女革命

    我们伟大领袖毛主席曾经指出：“全国妇女起来之日，就是中国革命胜利之时。”千百万工农劳动妇女在毛主席教导下，积极投入革命斗争，作出了重大贡献。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫一心想搞资本主义，从来不许妇女革命，反对妇女走社会主义道路。他胡说：“一般的女同志没有小孩子的不可能，真正在党里要做些事倒是不结婚好，也不反对打姘头。要结婚就下决心，正视必然性，要么下决心带孩子，不要再想什么远大前途。”照中国赫鲁晓夫的说法，妇女的出路有两条：一是结婚，带孩子，做家庭的奴隶；一是不结婚，不带孩子，去追求个人的“远大前途”。两条实际上是一条，就是不要革命。
    我们极端仇视和鄙视中国赫鲁晓夫的这些黑话。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的新中国妇女，坚决跟着毛主席闹革命。
    无数事实，驳倒了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命谬论。
    就拿我们北京针织总厂来说，女工占全厂职工的百分之五十七，其中很多都是结了婚和有了孩子的。她们不但在生产上是一支重要力量，而且在革命运动中也都和男职工并肩战斗，没有落后过。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，女工们一面坚持生产，一面积极投入战斗。许多有好几个孩子的妈妈，下了班也坚持不回家，和大家一起为保卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗。很多女工夜里参加革命运动，第二天照常上班生产。全厂职工在驻厂解放军八三四一部队支左人员的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，取得了我厂无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，并提前二十二天完成了一九六七年全年的生产任务，大大提高了产品质量，减少了废品次品。过去长期没有解决的一些技术问题，现在由于毛泽东思想挂了帅，得到了解决。我们创造成功了整烫机、验布机、包装机等等，大大节约了劳动力，降低了劳动强度，提高了劳动生产率。
    我们劳动妇女是抓革命促生产的一个重要力量。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想把我们关在家庭的小天地里，做“贤妻良母”，埋头家务，不问政治，好让党内最大的一小撮走资派颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。这是绝对办不到的！毛主席教导我们：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。”我们工人在旧社会受尽压迫和剥削，是毛主席他老人家把我们从苦海中救出来的。我们坚决听毛主席的话，为社会主义革命、社会主义建设而贡献自己的力量。
    我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义妇女运动路线。（附图片）
