Reporter of Xinhua News Agency: The people of the cities in South Vietnam, carrying forward the glorious tradition of the March 19 anti-American struggle, have demonstrated the invincible power of people's war in the earth-shaking Spring Offensive with their powerful military and political strike forces. In just a few dozen days, hundreds of large and small cities and towns, including Saigon, Hue, and Da Nang, have seen tens of millions of workers, students, and people from other strata rise up in revolt, forming a mighty revolutionary army. Together with the liberated armed forces and the rural people, they have fiercely attacked the enemy's so-called "safe" rear bases, dealt heavy blows to the enemy, severely punished traitors, overthrown the puppet regime, and struck the enemy with such force that they are terrified, sleepless, and at their wits' end.

The cities in South Vietnam are the strongholds of the American and puppet forces. For a long time, the American aggressors and their lackeys have been committing heinous crimes there. The enemy's brutal oppression and exploitation have ignited a fire of hatred in the hearts of the broad masses of the urban population. In the Spring Offensive, they took up arms with deep hatred for the enemy and fought bravely alongside the Liberation Army.

The people of Saigon, with a glorious tradition of anti-American struggle, once again dealt a heavy blow to the American aggressors and their lackeys in the great battle of the new spring, making their due contribution to the cause of resisting America and saving the nation. When the Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on the American "Embassy" and the puppet "Presidential Palace" and other enemy strongholds, tens of thousands of people rose up in struggle at the same time. Some acted as guides for the Liberation Army, some fought alongside the Liberation Army, and some took on logistical support for the Liberation Army. Large numbers of workers and young students joined the labor corps, braving the hail of bullets to deliver food, water, and ammunition to the Liberation Army. The self-defense teams in Saigon were active in many areas, coordinating with the Liberation Army in combat and propaganda. They bravely sniped at the puppet "Naval Command" in the city center for a long time, making the enemy look ridiculous. Saigon, the city where the brave anti-American gunshots rang out eighteen years ago, has today become a battlefield where the people are everywhere defeating the enemy.

The heroic people of Hue, in close coordination with the Liberation Army, annihilated many of the enemy's fighting forces in the Spring Offensive, demonstrating an indomitable fighting spirit. In the fierce street battles, they wiped out a large number of enemies. They cooperated with the Liberation Army to attack the "Flag Tower" enemy stronghold and climbed over the high walls to tear down the puppet regime's flag and hoist the glorious flag of the National Liberation Front. They also mobilized widely to serve the battle. An old woman risked her life to guide the Liberation Army to capture an American colonel "advisor" who was hiding. Western news agencies exclaimed: "Ninety percent of the people in Hue have joined the Viet Cong (referring to the National Liberation Front), and many people volunteer to work for the Viet Cong."

In addition to Saigon and Hue, the people of many cities in the plains of South Vietnam, especially the people of many towns in the Mekong Delta, also rose up in struggle and fought side by side with the Liberation Army, charging into the enemy's various strongholds, pursuing and annihilating the enemy, and achieving great merits.

Under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the urban people of South Vietnam have been widely mobilized, organized, and armed in the Spring Offensive. After destroying the puppet government institutions, the people in many cities have established revolutionary and patriotic organizations. Armed self-defense teams have sprung up like mushrooms after rain in the cities. Organized masses of people have vigorously carried out anti-traitor activities, safeguarding the fruits of the revolution and resisting the enemy's counterattacks. Ten female self-defense team members in Hue bravely repelled a battalion of American troops' counterattack with submachine guns and grenades, killing more than 120 enemies in one battle. Tens of thousands of young people in various cities have enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Armed Forces and marched to the battlefield. In the Mekong Delta provinces of My Tho, Ben Tre, Kien Phong, and An Giang, more than 7,500 young people joined the army in the first twenty days of the Spring Offensive. Saigon and Hue saw thousands of young people join the army and fight the enemy in just a few days. Some new soldiers have performed outstanding feats in the Spring Offensive and have been awarded the honorable title of "Heroes of Anti-American Warfare."

Under the heavy blows of the Spring Offensive, which is characterized by the combination of military and civilian forces, urban and rural areas, and internal and external forces, many of the most heinous elements in the puppet regime have received their due punishment. Many provincial and county puppet regimes have collapsed.

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable." The great victory of the urban and rural people of South Vietnam in the new spring has once again proven this brilliant thesis.

The people of South Vietnam have long been mobilizing and organizing the masses in the vast rural areas, carrying out guerrilla warfare, annihilating the enemy, and establishing revolutionary bases, creating a favorable situation of surrounding the cities from the countryside, and laying the foundation and favorable conditions for the urban people's anti-enemy struggle. Under the struggle of the broad masses of urban and rural areas, the enemy has fallen into the vast ocean of people's war, facing imminent doom.

The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys are currently slaughtering and persecuting the urban people who have risen up in struggle, attempting to reverse the situation. However, in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people, all their desperate struggles are in vain. As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Any military adventure and political deception by American imperialism is doomed to failure." The Vietnamese people, who resolutely respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to battle, will continue to overcome all difficulties, persist in protracted warfare, fully mobilize the great power of people's war, and continuously annihilate the enemy's fighting forces, and will surely achieve the final victory.

　　发扬“三·一九”反美斗争光荣传统　组织成浩浩荡荡的革命大军
　　南越新春攻势显示人民战争巨大威力
　　军民结合、城乡结合、内外结合打出了抗美救国斗争大好形势
    新华社十八日讯　本社记者报道：发扬“三·一九”光荣的反美斗争传统的越南南方城镇人民，在惊天动地的新春攻势中，以其强大的军事和政治的打击力量，又一次显示了人民战争的无敌威力。在几十天内，西贡、顺化、岘港等数以百计的大小城镇的千百万工人、学生以及其它阶层的人民群众，纷纷揭竿而起，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，同解放武装力量和农村人民一起，猛捣美伪集团认为最“安全”的后方巢穴，痛击敌军，严惩越奸，推翻伪政权，打得敌人丧魂落魄，寝食不安，走投无路。
    南越各城镇是美伪集团盘踞的巢穴。美国侵略者及其走狗长期以来在那里为非作歹，犯下了滔天罪行。敌人的残酷压迫和剥削，在城市广大人民群众的心里燃起了仇恨的怒火。在新春攻势中，他们怀着对敌人的深仇大恨，纷纷拿起武器，同解放军一道，英勇杀敌。
    富有反美斗争光荣传统的西贡人民，在新春的伟大战斗中，又一次给了美国侵略强盗及其走狗以沉重的打击，为抗美救国事业作出了应有的贡献。当解放武装力量猛袭美国“大使馆”和伪“总统府”等敌人巢穴的时候，成千上万的人民同时奋起斗争，有的充当解放军的向导，有的同解放军一起作战，有的为解放军担任后勤工作。大批工人和青年学生参加民工队，冒着枪林弹雨，为解放军送饭、送水、送弹药。西贡市的自卫队活跃在许多街区，配合解放军战斗和向群众宣传。他们长时间地英勇狙击市中心的伪“海军司令部”，打得敌人狼狈万状。西贡，十八年前曾经响起英勇的反美枪声的这个城市，今天已经成为人民到处痛歼敌人的疆场。
    英雄古城顺化市人民同解放军紧密配合，在新春战斗中歼灭了敌人许多有生力量，表现了无比英勇顽强的战斗精神。他们在激烈的巷战中消灭了大批敌人。他们配合解放军，袭击“旗台”敌军据点，并爬上高墙，扯下了伪政权的旗帜，升上光辉灿烂的民族解放阵线的旗帜。他们还广泛地动员起来，为战斗服务。一位老大娘冒着生命危险，给解放军带路去捉拿一名躲藏起来的美国上校“顾问”。西方通讯社惊呼：“顺化市百分之九十的人民群众归于越共（指民族解放阵线）了，很多人自愿为越共工作。”
    除了西贡和顺化之外，南越平原地区的许多城市的人民，尤其是湄公河三角洲上的许多城镇人民也纷纷奋起斗争，同解放军并肩作战，冲进敌人的各个巢穴，追歼敌人，立下了巨大的战功。
    在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，南越城镇人民在新春攻势中已经广泛地动员起来，组织起来，武装起来。在摧毁了伪政权机构之后，许多城镇的人民建立了革命和爱国的组织。城镇里的武装自卫队如雨后春笋般地建立起来，组织起来的人民群众，大力开展锄奸活动，保卫革命成果，抗击敌人的反扑。顺化市十名女自卫队员，在一次战斗中，用冲锋枪、手榴弹英勇打退一营美军的反扑，歼敌一百二十多名。各城镇成千上万的青年踊跃参加了人民解放武装力量，杀上疆场。在湄公河三角洲的美萩、槟椥、建丰、安江等省，在新春攻势的头二十天中，就有七千五百名青年参军。西贡、顺化在几天内就有数以千计的青年参军杀敌。一些新战士，在新春战斗中立下了出色的战功，获得了“歼美勇士”的光荣称号。
    在具有军民结合、城乡结合、内外结合的鲜明特点的新春攻势的沉重打击下，伪政权中许多罪大恶极的分子受到了应有的惩罚。许多省和县伪政权陷于瘫痪。
    伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。”越南南方城乡人民新春的伟大胜利，又一次证明了这一光辉的论断。
    南越军民长期以来在广大农村地区发动、组织群众，开展游击战争，歼灭敌人，建立了革命根据地，打出了农村包围城市的有利形势，为城市人民的歼敌斗争创造了前提和有利的条件。在城乡广大群众的奋起斗争下，敌人陷入了人民战争的汪洋大海之中，面临灭顶之灾。
    美帝及其走狗，目前正在大肆屠杀和迫害起来斗争的城镇人民，妄图挽救败局。但是，在英勇的越南人民面前，他们的任何垂死挣扎都是徒劳的。正如伟大领袖毛主席所指出：“美帝国主义的任何军事冒险和政治欺骗都是注定要失败的。”坚决响应胡志明主席的战斗号召的越南人民，再接再厉，排除万难，坚持持久作战，高度发挥人民战争的巨大威力，不断消灭敌人的有生力量，一定能够取得最后的胜利。
