New Delhi, March 28 (Xinhua) - The Indian weekly "Patriot" published a special issue in Hindi on Naxalbari in February, promoting Mao Zedong Thought and calling on the Indian revolutionary people to raise the banner of revolution and launch peasant revolutionary struggles.

The special issue features a photograph of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the world's people, on its front page. Below the photograph are two quotations from Chairman Mao: "To make revolution, it is necessary to have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." and "Revolution is not a dinner party, not an essay, not a painting, not embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another."

The inside cover of the issue introduces the publication of the Hindi edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the individual works of Chairman Mao by the Thought Publishing House, including: "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "The Spark Will Kindle a Prairie Fire," "Why Is the Red Army's Political Power Able to Exist in China?," "On the Rectification of the Party's Style of Work," "The Direction of the Youth Movement," "Reform Our Study," "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," "Against Libertinism," "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and "To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing."

The editorial titled "Raise the Sacred Banner of Revolution" says: The Naxalbari peasant uprising has become a catalyst for the Indian revolution, and all revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces have shown their true colors before it. The editorial says that the leaders of the Communist Party of India (referring to the revisionists of the CPI) have sworn more than anyone else to lead the revolution, but the spark of Naxalbari has proven that those who sincerely think about the true meaning of revolution are jubilant and praise Naxalbari, and are determined to spread this spark throughout the country, while those who shout revolution in public but sabotage it in secret have joined the ranks of traitors. Today, these leaders have perfectly illustrated the phrase "honeyed words, a dagger in the heart." They are still trying to win over all sincere revolutionary comrades with revolutionary slogans. However, these comrades are considering launching uprisings in various ways. Most revolutionary comrades have already joined the revolutionary ranks, some are moving towards it, and others will definitely join.

The editorial points out that under the influence of Naxalbari, peasant revolutionary struggles have arisen in some regions of India.

The editorial says that in West Bengal, the districts of Midnapore, Jalpaiguri, 24-Parganas, and Hooghly have launched peasant struggles under the influence of Naxalbari. The peasants in the districts of Champaran, Saharsa, Purnea, and Bhagalpur in Bihar have also fought against the police stations and landlord militias.

The editorial says that the revolutionary struggle of the peasants in Andhra Pradesh is also developing. The district of Srikakulam has become a battlefield for the struggle, and the reactionary ruling class is trying to dispatch armed police to suppress the peasant struggle, turning the entire region into a world of terror. However, the fire of revolutionary struggle is still spreading, and now the districts of Warangal and Nalgonda in Telangana have also erupted in struggle.

The editorial says that the peasant movement in Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh is also developing. The police officials there have declared that they will not let it become Naxalbari. However, the peasants understand that struggle is not bound by laws. No matter what laws the government enacts, the peasants understand the words of Comrade Mao Zedong: "This vast spear force... is a new armed force that makes all local tyrants and evil gentry tremble."

The editorial says that the revolutionary struggles across the country are developing, and the actions against revisionism are intensifying. Comrades are preparing to establish revolutionary organizations because they know that without a revolutionary organization, they cannot lead the revolution.

The editorial concludes by saying that it is now time for all revolutionary comrades to unite and raise the sacred banner of revolution, and join the struggle.

    号召人民高举革命大旗开展农民革命斗争
    决心把纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争火种播向全国各地强调革命斗争要有一个革命组织领导才能取得胜利
    新华社二十八日讯 新德里消息：印度《爱国者》周刊在今年二月出版了印地文的纳萨尔巴里特刊，宣传毛泽东思想，号召印度革命人民举起革命的旗帜，开展农民革命斗争。
    这期特刊在首页刊登了世界人民伟大领袖毛主席的照片。照片下边是两条毛主席的语录，一条是：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”另一条语录是：“革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让。革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”
    刊物封面里页介绍思想出版社发行了印地文本《毛主席语录》和毛主席著作单行本，其中有：《湖南农民运动考察报告》、《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《星星之火，可以燎原》、《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？》、《愚公移山》、《青年运动的方向》、《改造我们的学习》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、《论人民民主专政》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事》等。
    这期特刊发表的题为《举起神圣的革命的旗帜》的社论说：纳萨尔巴里农民起义成为印度革命的催化剂，一切革命派和反革命派都在它面前亮相。社论说，印度共产党的领导人（指印共修正主义分子）曾经比任何人都卖力地赌咒发誓宣称要领导革命，但是，纳萨尔巴里的星星之火证明了，那些真诚地思考真正含义上的革命的人们为此欢欣鼓舞，歌颂纳萨尔巴里，并决心把这个火种播向全国各个角落，而那些口头上高喊革命、暗中戕害革命的人们则站到叛徒的队伍中。今天这些领导人恰好应验了“口蜜腹剑”这句成语，他们还在以革命的词句来拉拢一切真诚革命的同志们。然而这些同志们正在考虑以各自不同的方式发动起义，多数革命的同志已经站到革命的行列中来了，一些人正在向这里靠拢，还有一些也将要站过来，一定会站过来。
    社论指出，在纳萨尔巴里的影响下，印度国内一些地区已经兴起农民革命斗争。
    社论说，西孟加拉邦的米德纳普尔、贾尔派古里、24—帕加纳斯、豪拉等县在纳萨尔巴里的影响下开展了农民斗争。比哈尔邦的昌帕兰、萨哈萨、普尔尼亚、巴加尔普尔等县的农民也与警察分局和地主武装展开了斗争。
    社论说，安得拉邦农民的革命斗争也在发展，斯里卡库兰县形成了斗争的战场，反动的统治阶级妄图调遣武装警察镇压那里的农民斗争，整个地区成为恐怖世界，但是革命斗争的火种仍在蔓延，现在特仑甘纳地区的伏隆古尔和拿尔刚达县也爆发了斗争。
    社论说，北方邦巴赫拉伊奇县的农民运动也有所发展，那里的警察官员宣称，不让那里变成纳萨尔巴里。但是农民懂得，斗争是不顾忌法律的。不论政府制订什么样的法律，可是农民理解毛泽东同志的这句话：“这个广大的梭镖势力，……是使一切土豪劣绅看了打颤的一种新起的武装力量。”
    社论说，全国的革命斗争在发展，反对修正主义的造反行动正在激化，同志们准备建立革命的组织，因为他们知道，没有革命的组织就不能领导革命。
    社论最后说，现在是一切革命同志团结在一起举起革命的神圣旗帜，参加到斗争中来的时候了。
