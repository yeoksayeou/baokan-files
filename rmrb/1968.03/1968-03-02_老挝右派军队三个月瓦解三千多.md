Under the fierce attacks of the patriotic military and civilians of Laos, the rightist military forces in Laos are rapidly disintegrating. According to incomplete statistics, since the start of the dry season last November, over three months, 3,594 enemy soldiers have been dissolved (including captured, surrendered, and deserted), which is five times more than the total number of enemy soldiers dissolved in the previous dry season.

In the battle of Nam Bao alone, from January 12 to 26, over the course of half a month, 1,867 rightist soldiers surrendered or were captured. Among them were one colonel, three majors, and 26 company commanders.

    老挝右派军队三个月瓦解三千多
    据新华社讯　在老挝爱国军民猛烈打击下，老挝右派军队正日益土崩瓦解。据不完全统计，从去年十一月旱季开始以来的三个月中，敌军就被瓦解（包括被俘、投诚和开小差）三千五百九十四人，这比上一个旱季敌军瓦解的总数还多五倍。
    仅南博一仗，在从一月十二日到二十六日的半个月中，右派军队就有一千八百六十七人投降或被俘，其中包括一个上校、三个少校、二十六个连长。
