Spring Festival has been over for a long time, but some students who returned home from the city for the holiday have not yet returned to school to resume classes and make revolution. They are running around in the countryside, interfering with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in rural areas, which has resulted in doing more harm than good, affecting the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and is not beneficial for the current spring plowing and production.

The Cultural Revolution in the countryside should be led by poor and lower-middle peasants. Students and teachers from the cities should not interfere with the movement in the countryside and affect agricultural production. We hope that students who are lingering in the countryside will quickly return to school to resume classes and make revolution, and not continue to hinder the movement and production in the countryside.

    不要妨碍农村的革命和生产
    春节已经过去很久了，有些从城里回家过春节的学生还不回校复课闹革命。他们在农村东跑西串，干预农村的无产阶级文化大革命，结果是帮了倒忙，影响了毛主席最新指示的全面落实，对当前春耕生产不利。
    农村的文化大革命应以贫下中农为主体。城市的学生、教师都不应该去干涉农村的运动，影响农业生产。我们希望逗留在农村的学生赶快回到学校去复课闹革命，不要继续妨碍农村的运动和生产。　山东高密县　一战士
