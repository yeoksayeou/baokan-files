The vast sky is filled with reports of victories. Our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force, with boundless loyalty to the great teacher Chairman Mao, on March 22nd, shot down another American imperialist unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft over a certain place in South China.

This is the second American aggressor aircraft shot down in less than ten days.

This is the fifth American aggressor aircraft shot down in less than three months.

The American imperialists are terrified by the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, beaten to a pulp by the spring offensive of the people and soldiers of South Vietnam, and thrown into chaos by the financial crisis sweeping the Western world. The American imperialists continue to provoke us militarily, showing that they are not willing to accept their defeat and are still struggling in their dying moments.

The American aggressor aircraft are being shot down one by one by our brave People's Liberation Army, proving that the great People's Liberation Army of China, with boundless loyalty to the great teacher Chairman Mao, to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is invincible. The air force soldiers say it well: "Loyal to Chairman Mao, eagles strike the sky with no enemies."

Let us shout: Learn from the PLA! Salute the PLA!

Our great teacher Chairman Mao has long issued the great call to "Learn from the People's Liberation Army."

Learning from the PLA, the fundamental principle is to be as loyal to Chairman Mao as the PLA is.

Only by being loyal to Chairman Mao can one have a high sense of vigilance against the enemy, closely watch the movements of all class enemies at home and abroad, and be ready to crush the enemy's provocations at any time.

Only by being loyal to Chairman Mao can one have a strong fighting will, listen to the battle orders at any moment, move at the wind, and follow closely.

Only by being loyal to Chairman Mao can one have a powerful fighting force, not be overwhelmed by any enemy, but overcome all enemies.

Loyal to Chairman Mao, the revolution is invincible!

    无限忠于毛主席　鹰击长空全无敌
    本报评论员
    万里长空，捷报频传。我英雄的人民解放军空军部队，怀着对伟大导师毛主席的无限忠心，三月二十二日又在华南某地上空，一举击落美帝军用无人驾驶高空侦察机一架。
    这是不到十天，击落的第二架美国强盗飞机。
    这是不到三个月，击落的第五架美国强盗飞机。
    美帝国主义被我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利吓得浑身发抖，被越南南方军民的新春攻势打得头破血流，被席卷西方世界的金融危机搞得一片慌乱。美帝国主义不断地对我国进行军事挑衅，说明他们绝不甘心自己的失败，他们还要进行垂死的挣扎。
    美国强盗飞机一架一架地被我英勇的人民解放军打得粉身碎骨，说明了无限忠于伟大导师毛主席，无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大的中国人民解放军永远是不可战胜的。空军战士说得好：“无限忠于毛主席，鹰击长空全无敌。”
    让我们高呼：向解放军学习！向解放军致敬！
    我们伟大的导师毛主席早就发出了“全国学人民解放军”的伟大号召。
    学习解放军，根本的根本，就是要象解放军那样无限忠于毛主席。
    无限忠于毛主席，才有高度的敌情观念，密切注视国内外一切阶级敌人的动向，随时准备粉碎敌人的挑衅。
    无限忠于毛主席，才有饱满的战斗意志，时刻倾听战斗的号令，闻风而动，步步紧跟。
    无限忠于毛主席，才有强大的战斗力，不被任何敌人所压倒，而要压倒一切敌人。
    无限忠于毛主席，革命战斗无不胜！
