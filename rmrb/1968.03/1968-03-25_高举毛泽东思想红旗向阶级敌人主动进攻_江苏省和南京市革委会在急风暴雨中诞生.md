The thunderous waves of the Yangtze River resound with joy, as 500,000 military personnel and civilians of Nanjing hold a grand rally to celebrate the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians have expressed their determination to hoist high the banner of revolutionary criticism, to seize class struggle, to strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and to be vigilant and crush all sabotage and disruption by class enemies. They vow to thoroughly criticize and expose the traitors within the party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangsu.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 24th — "The tiger crouches and the dragon coils, today surpassing yesterday; the world is turned upside down, the times are stirring." Amidst the call to arms for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the nation, a new triumphant song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution echoes from the frontline of the Yellow Sea and the banks of the Yangtze River — the Revolutionary Committees of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City have been gloriously born in the storm of class struggle! This is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Great leader Chairman Mao has always been concerned about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangsu Province. Chairman Mao's warm care and his series of latest instructions have given the revolutionary people of Jiangsu Province boundless courage and infinite strength. Over the past year, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the entire province, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have waged a sharp and fierce struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, smashed the repeated counterattacks of the enemies of the proletariat, exposed and criticized the traitors within the party such as Jiang Yiqing and Chen Guang, and seized back the power they had usurped, achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people of Jiangsu Province, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, have comprehensively implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, smashed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhanced proletarian party spirit, and developed and consolidated revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. A great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is flourishing. They have never been so spirited and enthusiastic. From the shores of the Yellow Sea to the banks of Hongze Lake, from the Xuhuai Plain to the Jiangnan region, industrial battle reports are frequent, spring plowing and production are surging to new heights, and the revolutionary and production situation in the entire province is better than ever.

On March 23rd, the provincial capital of Jiangsu, Nanjing, was adorned with red flags and echoed with cheers. Five hundred thousand revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army from all fronts across the province gathered in the People's Square, carrying the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," to hold a grand rally to celebrate the victorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City.

The celebration began with the majestic melody of "The East is Red." When the meeting solemnly announced the victorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, the entire venue erupted in cheers. People repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" "Long live our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Jiangsu is located on the frontline of national defense, the gateway to the Yangtze River. For a long time, the people of Jiangsu have followed the great leader Chairman Mao, waging a long, repeated, and arduous struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism. During the War of Liberation, under the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army's million-strong army crossed the Yangtze River, thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary lair of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, and ended the 22 years of bloody rule by the Kuomintang reactionaries over the Chinese people. Since liberation, the revolutionary people of Jiangsu Province have followed the great leader Chairman Mao, achieving new great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

"Without an army of the people, there can be nothing of the people." On the 23rd, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jiangsu, with hearts full of excitement, joined the masses to celebrate the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City. At the celebration, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres repeatedly shouted, "Learn from the great People's Liberation Army!" "Salute to the great People's Liberation Army!" "Long live the great People's Liberation Army!" In the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in Jiangsu Province, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jiangsu Province have resolutely responded to the battle call of the great leader Chairman Mao, armed the revolutionary cadres and broad revolutionary masses with the great Mao Zedong Thought, fought side by side with them, and achieved outstanding new merits in the "three supports, two military" work, playing a very significant role in seizing the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangsu Province.

Comrade Xu Shiyou, the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration. He said that the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee signifies that the people of Jiangsu Province are facing more glorious, more magnificent, and more arduous tasks. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the most important and fundamental task is to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more deeply and widely, and to achieve the revolutionization of people's thinking. He said that insisting on Mao Zedong Thought in all fields, achieving the revolutionization of people's thinking, is a matter of life and death for the country, the party, and the regime, and is the most important issue of whether the people gain everything or lose everything. He called on the people of the entire province to definitely learn from the brilliant example of Comrade Lin Biao, to love, believe in, worship, and be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line without limit, and to place the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. Comrade Xu Shiyou pointed out that we must continue to vigorously run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the key, touching the soul, thoroughly transforming the worldview, overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, enhancing proletarian party spirit, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on every battlefield.

Comrade Xu Shiyou emphasized that the class struggle in Jiangsu Province has always been extremely sharp and complex. At this moment of celebration, we must remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never resign themselves to their defeat, and they will make their last struggle," to seize class struggle, to strengthen proletarian dictatorship, to launch a fierce and continuous offensive against class enemies, to be vigilant and crush all sabotage and disruption by class enemies. We must hoist high the banner of revolutionary criticism, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism movement, thoroughly criticize and expose the traitors within the party such as the Chinese Khrushchev and their agents in Jiangsu, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, to thoroughly eliminate the poison they have spread. At the same time, we must, according to Chairman Mao's thoughts on party building, rectify the party organization and strengthen party building.

Comrade Xu Shiyou said that we must further implement Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," to seize the revolution and vigorously promote production, to quickly launch a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production, to further save on revolution, and to achieve double victories in revolution and production! He said, "Support the army and love the people," is Chairman Mao's great call and a consistent strategic thought of Chairman Mao. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people must more firmly believe in and rely on the army, help and support the army, and actively assist the People's Liberation Army to better complete the glorious task of "three supports, two military."

Comrade Xu Shiyou finally said that the Revolutionary Committee must become a strong command post for promoting Mao Zedong Thought. For the newly born Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary people must cherish it, support it, consolidate it, maintain its proletarian authority, help it to continuously improve, and absolutely not allow class enemies to shake it, split it, or overthrow it from the right or the ultra-"left." Each member of the Revolutionary Committee must set an example, practice what they preach, become a model of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, be a faithful servant of the people, use Mao Zedong Thought to hold power well, use power well, and forever follow the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao, making our proletarian revolutionary regime forever red, red to the end!

Comrade Du Ping, a responsible comrade of the Nanjing Military Region, Comrade Yang Guangli, Vice Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee and Chairman of the Nanjing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and Comrade Peng Chong, Vice Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary leading cadre, also spoke at the meeting.

Representatives of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards from the Nanjing area and various places in Jiangsu all spoke passionately at the meeting. They unanimously expressed that they would, under the leadership of the newly born proletarian revolutionary regime, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, with "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the key, continue to run and run well Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high tide. They would more broadly, more deeply, and more consciously carry out revolutionary criticism, further consolidate revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, and contribute their strength to defending the proletarian revolutionary regime of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City and to the continuous consolidation and strengthening of proletarian dictatorship.

The celebration was presided over by Comrade Wu Dasheng, Vice Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, a responsible comrade of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, also attended the meeting and spoke. Comrade Wang Hongwen, a responsible comrade of the Shanghai "Workers' General Headquarters," congratulated the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial and Nanjing Municipal Revolutionary Committees on behalf of the Shanghai proletariat.

The celebration, amidst thunderous applause and extremely enthusiastic cheers, passed a telegram of respect to the most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

After the meeting, a grand parade was held. (Photos attached)

The banks of the Yangtze River were adorned with red flags, and the cheers echoed under the Purple Mountain. On March 23rd, the revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of Jiangsu Province held a grand rally in the People's Square of Nanjing to celebrate the victorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City.

Revolutionary masses of Jiangsu Province sang and danced, celebrating the victorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City. With boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, they shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" ten thousand times and sang "Wishing our heart's most red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life!" ten thousand times.

    广大军民表示：一定要高举革命批判大旗，狠抓阶级斗争，大力加强无产阶级专政，警惕和粉碎阶级敌人的一切破坏和捣乱。誓把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其在江苏的代理人批深批透，批倒批臭
    新华社南京二十四日电　“虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军号中，祖国黄海前哨、扬子江畔传来了又一曲无产阶级文化大革命伟大胜利的凯歌——江苏省和南京市革命委员会，在阶级斗争的暴风雨中，同时光荣诞生了！这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    伟大领袖毛主席，一直关怀着江苏省的无产阶级文化大革命。毛主席的亲切关怀和毛主席的一系列最新指示，给了江苏省革命人民以无比的勇气和无穷的力量。一年多来，全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，根据毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线进行了尖锐、激烈的斗争，粉碎了无产阶级的敌人一次又一次的反扑，揭发和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在江苏省的代理人江渭清、陈光等党内一小撮走资派，把他们窃据的权力夺回到无产阶级革命派手中，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    江苏省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，大破资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，发展和巩固了革命大联合和革命三结合。一个活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，正在蓬蓬勃勃地深入展开。他们从来没有象现在这样斗志昂扬，意气风发。从黄海之滨到洪泽湖畔，从徐淮平原到锦绣江南，工业战线捷报频传，春耕生产正在掀起新的高潮，全省革命、生产形势空前大好，越来越好。
    三月二十三日，江苏省省会南京市，红旗如画，欢声震天。全省各条战线上的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员五十万人，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，汇集在人民广场，隆重举行大会，庆祝江苏省和南京市革命委员会的胜利诞生。
    庆祝大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。当大会庄严宣告江苏省和南京市革命委员会胜利诞生时，全场欢声雷动。人们一遍又一遍地振臂高呼：“伟大的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”江苏地处国防前线，长江门户。长期以来，江苏人民紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，同帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义进行了长期的、反复的、艰巨的斗争。解放战争时期，在伟大统帅毛主席的指挥下，人民解放军百万雄师过大江，彻底捣毁了蒋家王朝的反革命巢穴，结束了国民党反动派对中国人民二十二年的血腥统治。解放以来，江苏省革命人民紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了新的伟大成就。
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”二十三日，人民解放军驻江苏部队广大指战员怀着无比激动的心情，同广大群众一起欢庆江苏省和南京市革命委员会的光荣诞生。在庆祝大会上，广大无产阶级革命派一遍又一遍地高呼：“向伟大的中国人民解放军学习！”“向伟大的中国人民解放军致敬！”“伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！”在江苏省两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，人民解放军驻江苏部队广大指战员，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的战斗号令，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，同他们并肩战斗，在“三支”“两军”工作中立下了卓越的新功，对夺取江苏省无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，起了很巨大的作用。
    江苏省革命委员会主任许世友同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，江苏省革命委员会的成立，标志着江苏省人民正面临着更加光荣、更加伟大、更加艰巨的战斗任务。革命委员会成立以后，最重要、最根本的任务，就是要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加深入、广泛地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，实现人的思想革命化。他说，坚持在一切领域中用毛泽东思想挂帅，实现人的思想革命化，这是关系到国家的存亡、党的存亡、政权的存亡，是人民得到一切或丧失一切的头等重大问题。他号召全省人民一定要学习林副主席的光辉榜样，要象林副主席那样对伟大领袖毛主席、伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。许世友同志指出，我们要继续大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，触及灵魂，彻底改造世界观，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，增强无产阶级党性，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍各个阵地。
    许世友同志强调说，江苏省的阶级斗争历来十分尖锐复杂。在我们欢庆胜利的时刻，一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席关于“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎”的教导，狠抓阶级斗争，大力加强无产阶级专政，主动地向阶级敌人发起猛烈的连续进攻，警惕和粉碎阶级敌人的一切破坏和捣乱。要高举革命大批判的旗帜，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，继续深入地开展革命大批判运动，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在江苏的代理人，从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底肃清他们所散布的流毒。在这同时，还必须按照毛主席的建党思想，整顿党的组织，加强党的建设。
    许世友同志说，我们要进一步贯彻落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大战略方针，狠抓革命，猛促生产，迅速掀起工农业生产的新高潮，进一步节约闹革命，夺取革命、生产双胜利！他说，“拥军爱民”，是毛主席的伟大号召，是毛主席一贯的战略思想。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，要更加坚定地相信和依靠解放军，帮助和支持解放军，积极地协助人民解放军更好地完成“三支”“两军”的光荣任务。
    许世友同志最后说，革命委员会要成为大立毛泽东思想的坚强指挥部。对于新生的革命委员会，革命人民要爱护她，支持她，巩固她，维护她的无产阶级权威，帮助她不断完善。绝不允许阶级敌人从右的方面或极“左”的方面去动摇她、分裂她、颠覆她。革命委员会的每个成员，要以身作则，身体力行，成为活学活用毛泽东思想的模范，做人民忠实的勤务员，用毛泽东思想为人民掌好权，用好权，永远沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道前进，使我们的无产阶级革命政权永远红，红到底！
