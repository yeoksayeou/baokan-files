Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all work. Compared to all business and technology, politics is always the leader, in the first position. This position cannot be reversed, nor can a middle-of-the-road compromise be made.

Emphasizing proletarian politics means letting the invincible Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, using Mao Zedong Thought to command, guide, promote, and transform everything. Emphasizing politics must be implemented to improve the ideological revolution of people, using ideological revolution to promote the completion of all tasks.

Emphasizing proletarian politics is necessary to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent capitalist restoration. Not emphasizing proletarian politics will inevitably lead to emphasizing bourgeois politics; there is no middle ground.

Emphasizing politics or emphasizing military and technical matters has always been the focal point of the two-line struggle in our army. Insisting on emphasizing politics is loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; opposing emphasizing politics is betrayal of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing opposed emphasizing politics and advocated the fallacy of "technology first," aiming to oppose Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead and opposing the ideological revolution of people, to achieve their goals of usurping the party, the army, and the government.

The following articles by representatives of the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the Chemical Defense Corps provide a vivid and powerful criticism of the fallacies such as "technology first."

Emphasizing Politics is the Foundation of Platoon Building

Certain Unit's Seventh Platoon

What is the key to building a platoon? Is it emphasizing politics or emphasizing military matters? Where should emphasizing politics be implemented? This involves the fundamental struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois military lines.

While advocating the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," the Chinese Khrushchev also advocated that the party's main task is to "rapidly develop productive forces." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing even blatantly said that "good production, being able to produce more grain, is emphasizing politics." This is sheer nonsense! Over the past few years, our platoon has been focused on production. Due to the poisoning of such fallacies, the party branch once placed production in the first position. The cadres were busy with sowing areas, counting heads, calculating time, and computing yields. During the busy farming season, the daily reading of Chairman Mao's works was disrupted, and politics was disrupted. The result was that the political atmosphere in the platoon was thin, and the ideological problems among the soldiers could not be quickly resolved, and production did not improve. Comrades said: If politics does not lead, the direction will definitely be wrong, and production will not improve, leading to a series of problems.

Emphasizing politics is the fundamental aspect of Chairman Mao's proletarian military line. Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all work. If political work is done well, production and training can all be done well. Emphasizing politics means using Mao Zedong Thought as the leader, promoting the ideological revolution of the platoon's soldiers. This is the politics within politics, the soul within the soul, the fundamental within the fundamental. In recent years, the party branch of our platoon has always regarded establishing Mao Zedong Thought and cultivating the soldiers' unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao as the highest responsibility. We let Mao Zedong Thought command all our tasks, direct all our actions, and control every second of our lives. We use the vast fields as classrooms, memorize the "Three Articles" in our minds, and always measure ourselves with the "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people's "ruler." We always compare ourselves with the images of White, Zhang, and the "Old Fool," gradually eradicating the "self," and repeatedly cleansing the mud and dirt in our souls. Comrades say: Not studying Chairman Mao's works is the greatest betrayal; only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought can we follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize for life.

We listen to Chairman Mao's words, and the land listens to our words. Last spring and summer, during the drought, the seedlings could not be grown well, and even if they were grown, they could not survive after being transplanted. The first batch of seedlings all died. The party branch, based on the platoon's active thoughts, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations such as "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Comrades memorized Chairman Mao's highest instructions, applied them in action, guarded the fields day and night, carefully tended the seedlings, and fought against nature to obtain grain. Everyone had only one thought: To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to seize the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to support the world revolution, we must produce more grain. In this way, we finally overcame the drought and achieved another good harvest. This is the victory of emphasizing politics, a direct blow to the Chinese Khrushchev.

The work of building a platoon has countless aspects, but emphasizing politics and letting Mao Zedong Thought take the lead is the first. With this, there is everything for the people; without this, everything will be lost, and the party and the country will perish. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates that the party's main task is to "rapidly develop productive forces," aiming to secretly change the color of our country under the cover of "developing productive forces." Revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought will resolutely smash the Chinese Khrushchev's conspiracy!

### 突出政治是连队建设的根本

专栏：七亿人民都来做批判家

    编者按：毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。同一切业务和技术比起来，政治总是挂帅的，占第一位的。这个位置不能颠倒，也不能搞一半对一半的折中主义。
    突出无产阶级政治，就是让战无不胜的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，推动一切，改造一切。突出政治要落实到搞好人的思想革命化，以思想革命化来推动完成各项任务。
    突出无产阶级政治，是巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的需要。不突出无产阶级政治，必定突出资产阶级政治，中间道路是没有的。
    突出政治，还是突出军事、技术，一直是我军两条路线斗争的焦点。坚持突出政治，就是对毛主席和毛泽东思想的忠诚；反对突出政治，就是对毛主席和毛泽东思想的背叛。中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿反对突出政治，鼓吹“技术第一”等谬论，其罪恶目的就是反对毛泽东思想挂帅，反对搞人的思想革命化，以实现他们篡党、篡军、篡政的目的。
    这里发表的防化学兵首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会部分代表写的文章，对“技术第一”等谬论作了生动有力的批判。
　　突出政治是连队建设的根本
　　某部七连
    建设连队靠什么？是突出政治，还是突出军事？突出政治要落实到什么地方？这里存在着无产阶级和资产阶级两条根本对立的建军路线的斗争。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论的同时，鼓吹党的主要任务是“尽快的发展生产力”。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿也公然说什么“生产好，能够多打粮食，就算突出政治。”简直是一派胡言！几年来，我们连一直在搞生产。由于受了这种谬论的毒害，党支部曾一度把生产放在首位。干部们整天抓播种面积，数人头，计时间，算产量。到农忙季节，更是冲击了天天读毛主席著作的制度，冲击了政治。结果是连队政治空气稀薄，战士中出现的思想问题不能很快解决，生产也上不去。同志们讲：政治不领先，方向一定偏，生产上不去，问题一大串。
    突出政治是毛主席无产阶级军事路线的根本。毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。政治工作抓好了，什么生产、训练都能搞好。突出政治，就是要用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好连队指战员的思想革命化。这是政治中的政治，灵魂中的灵魂，根本中的根本。近几年，我们连的党支部工作始终把大立毛泽东思想、培养指战员无限忠于毛主席作为最高职责，让毛泽东思想统帅我们每一项任务，指挥我们每一个行动，支配我们生命的每一秒钟。我们以千顷良田作课堂，把“老三篇”记在脑子里经常照，把“完全”“彻底”为人民服务这把“尺子”装在身上经常量，把白求恩、张思德、“老愚公”三个形象放在心里经常比，把“私”字一点一点地挖掉，把灵魂深处的污泥浊水一遍一遍地冲刷干净。同志们说，不学习毛主席著作，是最大的忘本，最大的背叛；只有掌握了毛泽东思想，才能跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
    我们听毛主席的话，地听我们的话。去年春、夏两季干旱，秧苗育不好，育好了插下去也活不长，第一次插的秧全部死了。党支部根据连队的活思想，组织大家学习“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”等毛主席语录。同志们把毛主席的最高指示记在脑子里，用在行动上，昼夜守在地头，精心保苗，向自然开战，向大地要粮。大家只有一个念头：为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，为了夺取无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利，为了支援世界革命，我们一定要多收粮食。就这样，我们终于战胜了干旱，夺得了又一个好收成。这是突出政治的胜利，是对中国赫鲁晓夫的一个迎头痛击。
    连队建设工作千条万条，突出政治、毛泽东思想挂帅是第一条。有了这一条，就有人民的一切；丢掉这一条，就会丧失一切，就会亡党亡国。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹党的主要任务是“尽快的发展生产力”，其阴险目的就是妄图在“发展生产力”的烟雾下，悄悄地改变我们国家的颜色。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，坚决把中国赫鲁晓夫的这个阴谋彻底粉碎！
