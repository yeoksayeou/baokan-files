The Chinese-Pakistan Friendship Association held a banquet this evening to enthusiastically celebrate the 12th anniversary of the founding of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

Vice Premier Chen Yi of the State Council, relevant officials, and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in the capital, along with Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan and other Pakistani friends in Beijing, attended the banquet.

Chu Tu-nan, president of the China Council for the Promotion of International Friendship, spoke on behalf of the Chinese-Pakistan Friendship Association at the banquet. He said, China and Pakistan are friendly neighboring countries. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries have been increasingly hostile and destructive towards the developing friendship and cooperative relationship between China and Pakistan. This only shows that the friendship between China and Pakistan is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and is beneficial to the cause of unity and anti-imperialism among the peoples of Asia and Africa. The consolidation and development of the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan are unstoppable by any force. He wished the Pakistani people continuous new achievements on the road to independent development.

Ambassador Sultan, in his speech, praised the friendly relations between Pakistan and China and the new developments in the traditional friendship between the two peoples. He said, we are grateful for the firm support China provided to Pakistan when we were in danger. We highly appreciate the firm support of the Chinese government and people for the right of self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. The ambassador wished the Chinese people greater achievements under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao.

    为庆祝巴基斯坦国庆中巴友协举行招待会
    新华社二十二日讯　中国巴基斯坦友好协会今晚举行招待会，热烈庆祝巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国成立十二周年。
    国务院副总理陈毅，有关方面的负责人和首都革命群众组织的代表，同巴基斯坦驻中国大使苏尔坦以及在北京的其他巴基斯坦朋友，出席了招待会。
    对外友协会长楚图南代表中巴友协在招待会上讲话。他说，中国和巴基斯坦是友好的邻邦。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，对正在发展中的中巴友谊和两国的友好合作关系，越是百般敌视和破坏，就越说明中巴友好符合中巴两国人民的根本利益，是有利于亚非各国人民团结反帝事业的。中巴两国人民友谊的巩固和发展，是任何力量也不能阻挡的。他祝巴基斯坦人民在独立发展的道路上，继续不断取得新的成就。
    苏尔坦大使在讲话中赞扬了巴中两国的友好关系和两国人民传统友谊的新发展。他说，我们以感激的心情，回顾巴基斯坦在面临危险的时候，中国所给予我们的坚决支持，我们高度评价中国政府和中国人民对查谟和克什米尔人民自决权的坚决支持。大使祝中国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，取得更加伟大的成就。
