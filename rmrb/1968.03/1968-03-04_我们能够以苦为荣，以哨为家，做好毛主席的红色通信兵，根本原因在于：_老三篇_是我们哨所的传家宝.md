We can take pride in hardship and make the outpost our home, being good red communication soldiers of Chairman Mao, fundamentally because:

“The Old Three Articles” are the heirloom of our outpost.

In a remote mountain village surrounded by hills, our outpost is located in a place with inconvenient transportation. The lines we maintain pass through mountains at an altitude of 1,500 meters. The summer here is scorching hot, and the winter is bitterly cold. Living conditions are relatively harsh, and maintenance tasks are heavy. The Chinese Khrushchev, in his frenzied opposition to our study of Chairman Mao’s works, claims that in the party member’s textbook, “there should be no quotations from Chairman Mao.” This counter-revolutionary revisionist who has infiltrated the party aims to seize control of the party, the military, and the country, and actually wants to prevent us from studying the great Mao Zedong Thought. He is truly reactionary to the core!

We firmly remember the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao: “Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.” Studying Chairman Mao’s works is our most important and top priority. Actively learning and applying “The Old Three Articles” is the heirloom of our outpost.

Our outpost is in a small mountain village surrounded by hills. The region is remote, and transportation is inconvenient. The lines we maintain pass through mountains at an altitude of 1,500 meters. This region experiences scorching summers and bitterly cold winters, with relatively harsh living conditions and heavy maintenance tasks. The Chinese Khrushchev fiercely opposes our study of Chairman Mao’s works. We say: if we do not study Chairman Mao’s works, we cannot do a good job here even for a single day. Every comrade who has worked here has encountered numerous difficulties. Because we always prioritize studying Chairman Mao’s works, using the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, we have overcome selfish desires and vanquished one difficulty after another. We have continuously improved the conditions of the outpost, relatively well completed the line maintenance tasks, ensured smooth communication, and have been rated as a “Four Good” outpost for seven consecutive years.

Whenever someone is assigned to our outpost, the old comrades and new comrades together study “In Memory of Norman Bethune” and recall past hardships to cherish the present, establishing the thought of “wholeheartedly serving the people.” Comrades realize: although our work objects are just a dozen lines, each line connects to Beijing, day and night transmitting the voice of Chairman Mao’s command center, linking the hearts of the people across the nation with Beijing. We bear a heavy yet glorious task. Comrades say: “We must learn from Comrade Zhang Side, taking the outpost as our home and taking pride in hardship, climbing electric poles in the mountains for the revolution all our lives!” Over the years, we have worked in the wind and rain, in the deep snow of the night, exploring the mountains, climbing poles, repairing lines, and eliminating faults. The more difficult the situation, the more we think of Chairman Mao’s teachings: “We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do.” This produces boundless strength.

The more the Chinese Khrushchev opposes our study of Chairman Mao’s works, the more we must study the great revolutionary classics. We rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to settle down in the mountains, taking root. We are not afraid of harsh environments and heavy tasks. For the sake of transmitting Chairman Mao’s instructions and for the cause of communism, we fight all our lives in the mountain villages and feel immensely joyful.

### 我们能够以苦为荣，以哨为家，做好毛主席的红色通信兵，根本原因在于：  “老三篇”是我们哨所的传家宝

    我们能够以苦为荣，以哨为家，做好毛主席的红色通信兵，根本原因在于：
    “老三篇”是我们哨所的传家宝
    某部1038维护哨
    中国赫鲁晓夫污蔑我们学习毛主席著作是“形式主义”，叫嚷什么在党员课本中“不要摘引毛主席的话”。他这个混进党内的反革命修正主义分子，为了篡党篡军篡国，竟想阻止我们学习伟大的毛泽东思想，真是反动透顶！
    我们牢牢记着林副主席的指示：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”学习毛主席著作是我们最重要的头等大事，活学活用“老三篇”是我们哨所的传家宝。
    我们哨所是在一个群山环抱的小山村里，地区偏僻，交通不便。我们维护的线路经过拔海一千五百米的大山。这个地区夏天酷热，冬天严寒，生活条件比较艰苦，维护任务比较繁重。中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们说：如果不学习毛主席著作，我们在这里，一天也干不好。在这里工作过的每一个同志都遇到过不少困难，由于我们始终把学习毛主席著作放在第一位，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想，克服了私心杂念，战胜了一个又一个的困难，不断改变了哨所的面貌，较好地完成维护线路的任务，保证了通信联络的畅通，连续七年被评为四好哨。
    每逢有人分配到我们哨所，老同志就和新同志一起学习《为人民服务》，一起忆苦思甜，树立“全心全意地为人民服务”的思想。同志们认识到：别看我们的工作对象就是十几根线路，可是条条线路通北京，它日夜传送着毛主席司令部的声音，把全国人民的心和北京紧紧连在一起。我们担负着艰巨而光荣的任务，同志们说：“我们一定向张思德同志学习，以哨为家，以苦为荣，为革命在山沟里爬一辈子电线杆！”几年来，我们在风里、雨里，在大雪纷飞的深夜里，摸山沟，爬线杆，修理线路，排除故障。越是困难的时候，我们越是想到毛主席的教导：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”就产生了无穷的力量。
    中国赫鲁晓夫越是反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们就越要学习伟大的革命宝书。我们靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想在山沟里安下了家，扎下了根。我们不怕环境艰苦，任务繁重。为了传送毛主席的指示，为了共产主义事业，我们一辈子战斗在山村野岭，也感到无比欢畅。
