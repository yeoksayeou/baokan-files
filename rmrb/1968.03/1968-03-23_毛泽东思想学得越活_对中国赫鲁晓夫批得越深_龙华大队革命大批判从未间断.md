The more actively Mao Zedong Thought is studied, the deeper the criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev. The revolutionary criticism in Longhua Brigade has never stopped.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangdong Province, Boluo County, Longxi Commune, Longhua Brigade has been combining various tasks with sustained revolutionary criticism, greatly enhancing the consciousness of the commune members.

Longhua Brigade has been conducting revolutionary criticism for nearly a year. Now, it is still continuing and deepening. The commune members use their rest time in the fields to hold criticism meetings. On the 3rd, 6th, and 9th days of each month, the commune members gather by production team in the evenings to collectively study Chairman Mao's quotations and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Each family, when there is nothing to do in the evenings, also holds family criticism meetings or joint family criticism meetings. Over the past year, the revolutionary criticism columns set up by various production teams have been published continuously without interruption. Through revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of commune members have a deeper love for the great leader Chairman Mao, for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; they have an intense hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

The method of Longhua Brigade's sustained revolutionary criticism is as follows:

First, combine revolutionary criticism with production and work in each period, targeting the active thoughts of cadres and commune members, studying Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. This way, the commune members study Mao Zedong Thought actively, remember it firmly, and combine learning with practice, seeing immediate results, and the more they study, the more enthusiastic they become; they criticize the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev deeply and thoroughly, and the more they criticize, the more they hate the Chinese Khrushchev. In the past year, during the busy seasons of sowing and harvesting, in the development of sideline production, year-end distribution, and the delivery of public grain, they targeted the active thoughts of the commune members, studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, and focused on criticizing one aspect of the revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, making the revolutionary criticism deeper and deeper, and the proletarian consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the commune members continuously improving.

Second, in carrying out revolutionary criticism, emphasize class education, conduct activities of recalling bitterness and comparing the old and new societies, arouse the poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless love for Chairman Mao's proletarian feelings, and resolutely eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. Old poor peasant Chen Jin of Hongxin Production Team suffered greatly from the exploitation of landlords in the old society. When criticizing the reactionary fallacy of "three freedoms and one contract" by the Chinese Khrushchev, he recalled the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, gaining a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's great truth that "only socialism can save China," and hating the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crime of attempting to restore capitalism even more.

Third, combine revolutionary criticism with the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and the transformation of world outlook. When the poor and lower-middle peasants of Longhua Brigade conduct revolutionary criticism, they study one quotation from Chairman Mao, criticize one revisionist fallacy, and break down private interests and establish public interests in the criticism. When criticizing revisionism, they pay special attention to combining it with the transformation of their world outlook, breaking down the bourgeois "self" and establishing the proletarian "public." Through revolutionary criticism, they have effectively promoted the revolutionization of people's thoughts.

### 毛泽东思想学得越活　对中国赫鲁晓夫批得越深  龙华大队革命大批判从未间断

    毛泽东思想学得越活　对中国赫鲁晓夫批得越深 
    龙华大队革命大批判从未间断
    据新华社广州电　广东省博罗县龙溪公社龙华大队结合各项任务，持久地开展革命大批判，大大提高了社员的无产阶级觉悟。
    龙华大队开展革命大批判已经将近一年。现在，仍在持续深入地进行。社员们每天在田里劳动时，利用歇息时间，开田头批判会。每逢三、六、九学习日，社员们以生产队为单位，在晚间集体学习毛主席语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。各家各户，晚上没有事情，还召开家庭批判会或联家批判会。一年多来，各生产队办起的革命大批判专栏，一期接一期，从未间断。通过革命大批判，广大社员对伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加热爱；对中国赫鲁晓夫和他推行的反革命修正主义路线无比仇恨。
    龙华大队持久开展革命大批判的做法是：
    一，把革命的大批判和各个时期的生产、工作紧密结合起来，针对干部、社员中的活思想，大学毛主席的有关教导，大批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。这样做，社员们对毛泽东思想学得活，记得牢，学用结合，立竿见影，越学劲头越大；对中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论，批得深，批得透，越批对中国赫鲁晓夫恨得越深。在过去一年多时间里，他们在播种收获的大忙季节，在发展副业生产、年终分配、交售公粮等项工作中，针对社员中的活思想，学习毛主席的有关教导，重点批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个方面的修正主义谬论，使革命大批判步步深入，社员的无产阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟不断提高。
    二，在开展革命大批判中，狠抓阶级教育，进行忆苦思甜、新旧社会对比的活动，激发贫下中农无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级感情，坚决肃清中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒。红心生产队老贫农陈金，在旧社会受尽地主剥削，苦大仇深。在批判中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”反动谬论时，他忆旧社会的苦，思新社会的甜，更加深刻地认识到毛主席说的“只有社会主义能够救中国”这一伟大真理，对中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行更加仇恨。
    三，把革命的大批判和活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观结合起来。龙华大队的贫下中农进行革命大批判时，都是学一条毛主席语录，批一个修正主义谬论，在大批判中破私立公。他们在批判修正主义时，十分注意同改造自己的世界观结合起来，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字。通过革命大批判，有力地促进了人的思想革命化。
