	Ten Songs of the Mao Zedong Thought Study Class
	Yi Heyuan

	Mao Zedong Thought fills the sky, nationwide study classes are held,
	The benefits of the study classes are countless,
	A thousand and ten thousand songs of praise cannot be sung completely.
	First song of the Mao Zedong Thought study class:
	The great wave of the Cultural Revolution surges,
	Thousands of threads are grasped at the root,
	Learning Mao Zedong Thought is the top priority.
	Second song of the Mao Zedong Thought study class:
	The latest directives are kept in mind:
	"Holding study classes is a good method,"
	Problems are solved without fear of difficulty.
	Third song of the Mao Zedong Thought study class:
	Fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism are both ahead,
	Defeating factionalism and increasing party spirit,
	Unless the black hand of the poisonous snake is cut off, it will not be satisfied.
	Fourth song of the Mao Zedong Thought study class:
	The revolutionary great alliance triumphantly sings,
	In one night, the east wind rises,
	Flowers bloom everywhere, and good news is reported.
	Fifth song of the Mao Zedong Thought study class:
	The revolutionary three-in-one combination is realized early,
	The leading group's thoughts are revolutionized,
	The double burden of revolution and production is shouldered.
	Sixth song of the Mao Zedong Thought study class:
	Anarchism is surrounded and annihilated,
	Revolution is grasped tightly and not relaxed,
	Production enthusiasm is added.
	Seventh song of the Mao Zedong Thought study class:
	Efforts are made to change one's worldview,
	New achievements are made without relying on old merits,
	Self-criticism is made exemplary.
	Eighth song of the Mao Zedong Thought study class:
	Tens of thousands of new people are cultivated,
	The seedlings are nourished by dew and grow strong,
	All trees in the frost are red and vibrant.
	Ninth song of the Mao Zedong Thought study class:
	Urban and rural factories and communes are all established,
	Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread,
	A red sun shines over the rivers and mountains.
	Tenth song of the Mao Zedong Thought study class:
	The power of Mao Zedong Thought is boundless,
	The revolutionary situation in the country is limitlessly good,
	The red flag dances in the wind.
	Singing together loudly, ten thousand songs and a myriad of melodies cannot be sung completely.
	Following the great helmsman Chairman Mao,
	Sailing against the wind and waves, forever forward!
