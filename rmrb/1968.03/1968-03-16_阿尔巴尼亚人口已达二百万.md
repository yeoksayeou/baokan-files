Albania's population has reached two million. According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, the People's Republic of Albania currently has a population of two million. Compared to the statistics from 1944 when Albania was liberated, the national population has increased by 82 percent.

Currently, the urban population of Albania accounts for more than 33 percent of the total population. The population of the capital, Tirana, has exceeded 170,000, while in 1938 it was only 25,000.

Since Albania's liberation, with the continuous development of production and construction, the living and medical conditions of the broad masses of laborers have gradually improved. Consequently, the birth rate has increased, the death rate has decreased, and the population has seen a significant increase.
