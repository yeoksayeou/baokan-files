A Shining Example

The heroic deeds of fifteen-year-old Shkurtë Vata have spread throughout the Land of Eagles, stirring the hearts of every Albanian.

This night, the party and government officials of Dukagjin, along with all the residents of this remote mountain area, gathered at the riverbank in Dukagjin Center with reverent hearts. They were waiting for the body of the young hero who had sacrificed himself on the construction site of the Logaricë-Fier railway to be brought back.

Among the crowd, an old man with prominent cheekbones and a wrinkled face, grasped the hand of Dukagjin Party Secretary Mark Ndau and said, "Oh, Mark, why don't you speak? Truly, my Shkurtë has gloriously given her life for the Party, and I feel she has not died! We all should contribute everything for the Party's cause!"

This old man was Pal Vata, Shkurtë's father. Mark grasped his strong hand and, in the traditional manner, tightly embraced Pal, kissing his forehead, and said, "Uncle Pal, you are truly a tough man. You have brought honor to the Party and to Dukagjin! Our people are proud to have such a good citizen as you!"

Father and Daughter

Pal Vata is a member of an agricultural cooperative in a mountainous area of the Shkodër district of Albania. He is also the son of those mountain people who have fought bravely for freedom, independence, and liberation for centuries. To fight for national liberation, Pal's grandfather sacrificed his life in the fierce battle against Turkish aggression. His uncle sacrificed his life in the struggle against foreign aggression. His father also participated in the struggle for national liberation.

Pal grew up alone, his heart filled with boundless hatred for the enemy. He had worked as a laborer in Kosovo, Shkodër, and Zadrima. In 1944, the heroic army led by Comrade Enver Hoxha liberated the suffering homeland. From then on, Pal began a new life. He dedicated his entire being to the Party, demonstrating with his actions his boundless love for the Party of Labor and the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha.

In the village of Buçaj, he was the first to join the agricultural production cooperative and actively propagandized among the surrounding farmers. People praised him, saying, "Although Pal is old, he is getting younger every day!"

When the People's Assembly of Saranda wrote a letter to Comrade Hoxha to eliminate unreasonable religious and other backward customs, Pal was overjoyed. After signing the letter, he discussed with his wife and children how to carry out this work in practice.

"Father, I have been fourteen for several months now. I request to join the Albanian Labor Youth League. Is that okay?" Shkurtë asked her father seriously.

Pal smiled and replied, "Good child, of course, I am happy about such a good thing. But joining the organization is not enough; one must also work well. Being a laggard is not our family tradition!"

"Shkurtë will not disgrace us!" her mother said from the side.

Indeed, Shkurtë was truly outstanding. In the youth organization, she was the first to volunteer to go to the railway construction site for voluntary labor, forming the "Mujo Spanu" labor brigade. Thus, they carried the bright red flag, wearing the commemorative scarves of voluntary labor, and shouldered their shovels and picks, marching proudly to the plain of Mushqeta.

Just fifteen years old, Shkurtë worked like a strong young man. She was always at the forefront, taking on the heaviest tasks. She was particularly caring towards her comrades. Everyone said that this young girl radiated a unique youthful vigor. Her close friend Landa said, "Compared to her, we are really ashamed. She always overfulfilled her quotas. That day, when the earth suddenly collapsed, she only said these words: 'Don't worry about me, I am nothing, keep working! Strive for victory! For the Party and the homeland!' Even after the surgery, she still said these words. She never forgot the Party and her comrades. When her father came to the hospital to visit her, father and daughter talked calmly, as if nothing had happened. She was a girl of extraordinary willpower!"

Shkurtë Lives in Our Hearts

When Shkurtë's body was brought back to the village, the villagers all came to comfort the Vata family. But Pal said to the villagers, "Comrades, this is your glory! Shkurtë has not died; she will always be a voluntary laborer, she will always live in our hearts! Friends, tell me, do brave people die?"

"No, Uncle Pal!" the people said.

"Do brave people cry?"

"No, glorious Pal comrade! Brave people always sing!"

Yes, the Albanian people will always sing!

The heroic and resonant song of the Albanian people echoes through the valleys and rivers—

Who says Shkurtë has left the world?
Who says she will never see the sixteenth spring?
She dedicated her youth to the revolution,
Like a dove spreading its wings to fly high.

No, Shkurtë is forever a red flower,
She is a red flag, waving in the wind on the railway construction site!

Who Will Take Over?

Shkurtë has sacrificed herself, and someone needs to take over her work on the construction site. This news spread throughout Dukagjin overnight.

On the night of November 3 last year, the youth organization of the village of Leke held a meeting and decided that everyone would go to the railway construction site for voluntary labor the next day. On the same night, the youth organizations of Buçaj, Mauër, Rodaj, Gërmaj, Zanaj, and Polaj reported to the Party Committee that all the youth wanted to participate in voluntary labor.

So many people wanted to take over Shkurtë's work, it made the Dukagjin Party Committee very difficult. Finally, the Party Committee decided to select twenty people from hundreds of youth to go to the construction site. However, at the moment this decision was announced, even more exciting news came: Shkurtë's father, Pal Vata, and her cousin actively requested to go to the construction site to take over her work!

That night, Pal Vata held a special meeting at his home. Pal said to his wife, "Shkurtë sacrificed herself heroically for the Party; we should go to take over her work."

"You can't go; this work must be done by me!" the mother firmly said.

"Father, we will go! We are Young Pioneers, and we can also sacrifice our lives for the Party!" the two younger sons eagerly requested their father's permission to participate in voluntary labor.

The whole family's hearts were boiling. After a heated discussion, the family meeting finally decided that Pal and Shkurtë's cousin would go to take over her work.

Thus, Pal and the most outstanding youth selected from various places came to the construction site where Shkurtë had fought.

On the construction site where Shkurtë had fought, Pal and the youth worked together.

Letters filled with deep proletarian feelings flew like snowflakes from all over Albania to Pal's embrace. Newspapers praising Pal and Shkurtë, such as "The Voice of the People," quickly spread among the people.

"The Central Committee of the Party of Labor has made a special resolution to posthumously recognize Comrade Shkurtë as a formal member of the Party of Labor!"

"Comrade Hoxha has written a letter to Uncle Pal! The letter says: Shkurtë has set a shining example of high patriotism, heroism, and boundless love for the homeland, the Party, and the people with her bold actions."

Instantly, the entire construction site boiled over, and everyone lifted Uncle Pal up, singing and shouting in joy. "Long live the Party of Labor!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" The cheers echoed throughout the construction site.

Brave Eagles, Spread Your Wings and Soar!

　　光辉的榜样
    十五岁的小英雄什库塔·瓦塔的光辉事迹传遍了山鹰之国，激动着每个阿尔巴尼亚人的心……。
    这天夜里，杜卡吉尼的党政负责同志，以及这个偏僻山区的全体居民，怀着崇敬的心情来到杜卡吉尼中心，聚集在河岸上。人们等待着在洛格齐恩—费里铁路建设工地英勇献身的小英雄的遗体运回来。
    在人群中，一位颧骨微微突出、满面皱纹的老人，握住杜卡吉尼党委书记马尔克·恩道乌的手说：“噢！马尔克，你为什么不讲话啊？说真的，我的什库塔为党光荣地献出了生命，我觉得她并没有死！我们都应当为党的事业而贡献一切！”
    这位老人叫帕尔·瓦塔，是什库塔的爸爸。马尔克握着他那有力的大手，并象传统那样，紧紧地拥抱了帕尔，亲吻他的额头，说道：“帕尔大叔，你真是一个硬汉子，你为劳动党和我们杜卡吉尼争得了光荣！我国人民为有你这样的好公民而自豪啊！”
    父亲和女儿
    帕尔·瓦塔是阿尔巴尼亚斯库台区一个山区的农业合作社社员，他也是那些为了自由、独立和解放进行过几个世纪英勇战斗的山民的儿子。为了争取民族解放，帕尔的祖父在反抗土耳其侵略的激战中英勇牺牲了。他的伯父在反抗外国侵略的斗争中献出了生命。他的爸爸也参加了争取民族解放的斗争。
    帕尔孤苦伶仃地成长着，内心充满了对敌人的无比仇恨。他在科索沃、斯库台、扎得林姆作过苦工。一九四四年，恩维尔·霍查同志领导的英雄军队解放了苦难的祖国。从此帕尔开始了新生活。他把整个身心都交给了党，他以自己的行动表明了，他对劳动党和伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的无限热爱。
    在百查村，他第一个加入农业生产合作社，并向周围的农民进行积极宣传。人们都夸他：“别看帕尔上了年纪，可越活越年轻啊！”
    当萨拉人民会议给霍查同志写信，要消灭不合理的宗教和其他落后习俗时，帕尔高兴极了，他在信上签了名以后，就同妻子和孩子们一起商量，如何以实际行动来搞好这项工作。
    “爸爸，我年满十四周岁已经几个月了，我要求加入阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟，好吗？”什库塔严肃地问父亲。
    帕尔微笑着回答：“好孩子，这样好的事我当然高兴。不过，光加入组织还不够，还应当很好地工作，落后当尾巴可不是我们家的传统！”
    “什库塔不会给我们丢脸的！”妈妈在一旁说。
    是的，什库塔真是好样的。在青年组织里，她第一个报名去铁路建设工地参加义务劳动，组成了“穆·斯班荻”劳动队。就这样，他们打着鲜艳的红旗，带着义务劳动的纪念围巾，扛着锹镐，雄赳赳，气昂昂，来到了茂柴却平原。
    刚刚年满十五岁的什库塔，干起活来简直象一个身强力壮的小伙子。她事事跑在前头，专找重活干。她对同志特别关心。大家都说，这个小姑娘的身上洋溢着一种特殊的青春活力。她生前的好朋友兰达说：“和她相比，我们可真有些惭愧，她总是超额完成指标。那天，当土堆突然塌下来的时候，她只说了这几句话：‘不要管我，我算不了什么，继续干下去啊！争取胜利！为了党和祖国！’动过手术以后，她还是讲这几句话。她念念不忘的是党和同志们。当她父亲来到医院看望她的时候，父女俩平静地谈着，简直就象没发生任何事情似的。她是一位意志非常坚强的姑娘！”
    什库塔活在我们心中
    什库塔的遗体运回村里，乡亲们都赶来安慰帕尔一家。但是，帕尔却对乡亲们说：“同志们，这是你们的光荣！什库塔没有死，她永远是一个义务劳动者，她永远活在我们的心中！朋友们，你们说，勇敢的人会死吗？”
    “不会死！帕尔大叔！”人们说道。
    “勇敢的人哭泣吗？”
    “不，光荣的帕尔同志！勇敢的人永远歌唱！”
    对！阿尔巴尼亚人民永远歌唱！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民歌唱什库塔的雄壮嘹亮的歌声响彻山谷、河畔——
    谁说什库塔离开了人间？
    谁说她再也见不到第十六个春天？
    她把青春献给了革命，
    如同鸽子展开双翅高高飞翔。
    不，什库塔永远是鲜红的花朵，
    她是一面红旗，在铁路工地上迎风飘扬！
    谁来接班
    什库塔牺牲了，需要一个人到工地去接她的班。一夜间这个消息传遍了整个杜卡吉尼。
    去年十一月三日夜晚，列卡村青年组织召开会议，决定第二天全体到铁路建设工地参加义务劳动。也就在这天夜里，百查村、玛乌里奇、罗达依、格玛依、扎恩、波拉依等地的青年组织纷纷向党委会报告，所有的青年都要求参加义务劳动。
  这么多的人都请求接什库塔的班，可把杜卡吉尼党委会难住了。最后党委会决定，从上百名青年中挑选二十名去工地。然而就在这个决定下达的时候，又传来了更激动人心的消息：什库塔的爸爸帕尔·瓦塔和她的表姐积极要求到工地去接班！
    那天夜里，帕尔·瓦塔家里召开了一个特别会议。帕尔对妻子说：“什库塔象一个英雄那样为党牺牲了，我们应该去接她的班。”
    “你不能去，这个班得由我来接！”母亲坚决地说。
    “爸爸，我们去！我们是少先队员，我们也可以为党献出生命！”两个小儿子也争先恐后地要求爸爸允许他们去参加义务劳动。
    全家人的心都在沸腾。经过热烈的争论，家庭会议最后决定由帕尔和什库塔的表姐去接她的班。
    就这样，帕尔和从各地挑选的最优秀的青年来到了什库塔生前战斗的工地。
    在什库塔生前战斗的工地上，什库塔的父亲帕尔和青年们一起劳动着。
    一封封充满无产阶级深厚感情的信件，象雪片一样不断从阿尔巴尼亚各地飞向帕尔的怀抱。一张张赞扬帕尔和什库塔的《人民之声报》，飞快地在人们中间传开了。
    “同志们，劳动党中央委员会作出了特别决议，追认什库塔同志为劳动党正式党员！”
      “霍查同志给帕尔大叔来信了！信中说：什库塔以自己的果敢行为，树立了崇高的爱国主义、英雄主义以及无限热爱祖国、热爱党和人民的光辉榜样。”
    顿时，整个工地沸腾起来，大家把帕尔大叔举了起来，尽情地欢呼、歌唱。“劳动党万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”欢呼声响彻整个工地。
    勇敢的山鹰展翅高翔吧！
