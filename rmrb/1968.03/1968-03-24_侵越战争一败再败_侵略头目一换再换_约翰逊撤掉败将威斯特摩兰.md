The Vietnam War suffers defeat after defeat, aggressors change leaders again and again
Johnson removes defeated general Westmoreland

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 23rd: Washington news: On the 22nd, the U.S. imperialist head Johnson announced that he would remove the defeated U.S. general in Vietnam, Westmoreland, from his position as commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam. This is Johnson's second "midstream change of horse" after he removed Secretary of Defense McNamara from his post last November, fully demonstrating that U.S. imperialism is in a state of utter helplessness and disarray in the Vietnam War.

	According to Johnson's announcement, Westmoreland will leave his position as commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam in July to take on the relatively powerless role of Army Chief of Staff. The war criminal Westmoreland, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people, has, over the past four years as the U.S. commander in Vietnam, followed Johnson's orders to repeatedly "escalate" the war, increasing the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam from over two million to 520,000. However, under the increasingly heavy blows from the Vietnamese people, his strategies and tactics have all failed, and each "escalation" has resulted in even more devastating defeats.

	Recently, under the thunderous blows of the South Vietnamese people's New Year Offensive, the arguments within the U.S. ruling class over the failures in Vietnam have reached an unprecedented level of intensity. The criticism within the ruling class against the defeated general Westmoreland has grown stronger and stronger, with more and more people demanding that Westmoreland be removed. In this situation, Johnson finally had to order his "most outstanding authority" and "most trusted" person to pack up and return to the United States at this "critical moment" when the U.S. war in Vietnam has suffered unprecedented defeats, serving as another "scapegoat" for the failure in Vietnam.

    侵越战争一败再败　侵略头目一换再换
    约翰逊撤掉败将威斯特摩兰
    据新华社二十三日讯　华盛顿消息：美帝头子约翰逊二十二日宣布要撤掉美国侵越败将威斯特摩兰的侵越美军司令职务。这是约翰逊继去年十一月撤掉国防部长麦克纳马拉的职务之后，而被迫采取的又一个“中流换马”的行动，充分地表明美帝国主义在侵越战争中陷入了黔驴技穷，狼狈不堪的境地。
    据约翰逊宣布，威斯特摩兰将在七月间离开他的侵越美军司令职务，去担任对侵越战争没有多大实权的陆军参谋长的差事。双手沾满越南人民鲜血的战争罪犯威斯特摩兰，在担任侵越美军头目的四年来，按照约翰逊的意旨，在侵越战争中一再使战争大“升级”，使侵越美军几年来从两万多人增加到五十二万人。但是，在越南人民越来越沉重的打击下，他的战略战术统统破产了，每一次大“升级”，其结果都是遭到更惨重的失败。
    最近，在南越人民新春攻势的雷霆万钧的打击下，美国统治集团围绕侵越失败而进行的争吵达到了空前激烈的程度，统治集团内部对败将威斯特摩兰的抨击一阵比一阵强烈，越来越多的人要求把威斯特摩兰撤掉。在这种情况下，约翰逊终于不得不下令要他的这个“最优秀的权威”和最受“信任”的人，在美国侵越战争遭到空前惨败的这个“重要时刻”，卷起铺盖，滚回美国，作为侵越失败的又一个“替罪羊”。
