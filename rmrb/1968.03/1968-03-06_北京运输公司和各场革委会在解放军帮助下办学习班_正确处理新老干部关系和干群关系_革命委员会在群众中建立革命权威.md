The PLA personnel stationed in Beijing Transport Company to support the left have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings that "we cannot assume that the new system will be completely consolidated once it is established; that is impossible. It needs to be gradually consolidated," actively helped the company and its 18 affiliated units to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they constantly struggle against the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, correctly handle the relationships between new and old cadres, between the representatives of the two factions within the revolutionary committees, and between cadres and the masses. This has made the temporary power organs of the revolutionary three-in-one combination increasingly consolidated and established revolutionary authority among the masses.

The relationship between new and old cadres is the first problem encountered after the establishment of the revolutionary committees. Some young revolutionaries, after being elected into the revolutionary committees, are full of vigor and enthusiasm, dare to take on responsibilities, and work actively and enthusiastically, making significant contributions to the revolution and production. However, some new cadres lack experience and are accustomed to rushing into work without paying attention to detailed ideological and political work. Some new cadres do not fully trust the old cadres, and if the old cadres' reasonable suggestions or correct actions do not align with their personal preferences, they develop resentment towards the old cadres. Some old cadres, on the other hand, are overly cautious and lack initiative in their work. When they see flaws in the new cadres' work, they do not dare to point them out. The PLA personnel supporting the left saw this situation and helped the revolutionary committees at all levels to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. This problem must be solved."

"The party, if it does not have a large number of new cadres working together with old cadres, our cause will be interrupted. Therefore, all old cadres should welcome new cadres with great enthusiasm and care for them." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, new and old cadres deeply examined and fought against their own selfishness, making self-criticisms. They then, according to the spirit of the brilliant work "The Working Methods of the Party Committee," established a system of democratic centralism within the revolutionary committees, where major issues are discussed and decided collectively, and responsibilities are divided for implementation. This way, old cadres can avoid the shortcomings of a "one-person show," and new cadres are cultivated, learning to handle problems boldly and meticulously.

Through these efforts, a revolutionary camaraderie of mutual respect, mutual learning, complementing each other's strengths, and mutual assistance has been established between new and old cadres. In one unit, a new cadre was criticized in a big-character poster for giving a long and unclear report. He became very angry and posted a counter-criticism note on the poster, revealing his arrogance, which the masses did not react well to. The old cadres in the revolutionary committee had a heart-to-heart talk with him, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism together, and using their own past experiences of rejecting criticism from the masses, which led to serious errors, to enlighten him. With the help of the old cadres, this new cadre apologized to the masses who posted the big-character poster for his mistakes. The company's revolutionary committee director, Wang Yuxiu, encountered difficulties in work, and new cadres always encouraged and supported him to do a good job. Once, the company received a task to support transportation in another province. Wang Yuxiu was afraid that the masses would not listen to him for mobilization, but when he explained the situation, a new cadre personally led the workers to carry out the task. Wang Yuxiu saw that the new cadres and revolutionary masses resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy and actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and was deeply moved, becoming more active and responsible in his work, always cooperating well with the new cadres.

Within the revolutionary committees, the representatives originally from the two factions of mass organizations, due to the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, would, when encountering disagreements in work, think of past "internal wars," harboring suspicions and not yielding to each other. When establishing revolutionary leadership groups in the units, some representatives did not stand on the proletarian party's principles, considering the overall and collective interests, but rather from the perspective of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, fighting for power and positions for small groups. To address this issue, the PLA personnel supporting the left helped them study Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, launching a "people's war" to suppress factionalism throughout the company. Many members of the revolutionary committees with serious factionalism actively criticized their erroneous thoughts of "considering themselves as the core of the old revolutionary faction" and "putting themselves at the center," expressing their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, "not only to unite with those who agree with us, but also to be good at uniting with those who disagree with us." They actively went to the masses to do "disinfection" work, eliminating the influence of factionalism, and successfully establishing revolutionary leadership groups in each unit, achieving a red tide throughout the company. The representatives originally from the two factions frequently held life meetings and heart-to-heart talks together, recalling class bitterness and criticizing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. Now, the representatives originally from the two factions in the revolutionary committees at all levels of this company can basically act according to the principles of proletarian party nature, and their thoughts and feelings are becoming closer.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, how to establish a relationship with the broad revolutionary masses is a very important issue. Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "resolving the upper and lower level relationship problems well and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses" have pointed the way for the members of the revolutionary committees at all levels of this company. They repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "serving the people wholeheartedly and never leaving the masses." They unanimously agreed that the revolutionary committees must be built into a highly revolutionary fighting collective that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and all members must "be both an official and a common person." They appeared among the masses as ordinary laborers, eating, living, studying, and working with the masses. Revolutionary committees and revolutionary leadership groups at all levels have established a system for cadres to participate in labor, and many committee members insist on working and producing at their original posts. Some committee members responsible for workshops and teams, while implementing leadership, also work as ordinary workers, taking on heavy duties, not being late or leaving early. They are closely connected with the broad masses, establishing deep class feelings with the masses, and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses.

    北京运输公司和各场革委会在解放军帮助下办学习班
    正确处理新老干部关系和干群关系
    革命委员会在群众中建立革命权威
    据新华社五日讯　在北京市运输公司支左的解放军同志，遵循毛主席关于“不能认为新制度一旦建立起来就完全巩固了，那是不可能的。需要逐步地巩固”的教导，积极帮助这个公司和所属十八个场的革命委员会举办毛泽东思想学习班，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，不断地同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作斗争，正确处理新老干部之间、原属两派群众组织的委员之间和干群之间的关系，使革命三结合的临时权力机构越来越巩固，在群众中建立了革命的权威。
    新老干部之间的关系，是革命委员会建立以后遇到的头一个问题。一些革命小将被选入革命委员会以后，朝气蓬勃，干劲十足，敢于挑担子，工作积极热情，对革命、生产作出了不少贡献。但是有的新干部，缺乏经验，工作上习惯于猛冲猛打，不善于做细致的思想政治工作。有的新干部对老干部还不大信任，老干部提出的合理建议或做的正确的事情，如果不合他们个人的心意，就对老干部有意见。有些老干部则“怕”字当头，工作上不大胆，看到新干部工作有缺点，也不敢提。支左的解放军同志看到这种情况，就帮助各级革命委员会的新老干部认真学习毛主席的教导：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”
  “我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。所以一切老干部应该以极大的热忱欢迎新干部，关心新干部。”按照毛主席的教导，新老干部都深挖、狠斗自己的“私”字，作了自我批评。然后根据《党委会的工作方法》这篇光辉著作的精神，确定在革命委员会内部实行民主集中制，重大问题都经过集体讨论，作出决定，分工负责执行。这样，老干部可以避免个人说了算的“一言堂”的缺点重犯，新干部得到了培养，学到了大胆而周密地处理问题的方法。
    经过这些工作，新老干部之间建立了彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，互相帮助的革命感情。有一个场的一位新干部，群众给他贴了一张大字报，批评他的报告太长，说得不清楚。他就非常生气地在这张大字报上贴了一张反批评的纸条，字里行间流露出骄傲情绪，群众反应很不好。革命委员会的老干部就亲切地和他谈心，同他一起学习毛主席关于批评与自我批评的教导，并且用自己过去长期以来拒绝群众批评，严重脱离群众以致犯了错误的教训去启发他。在老干部的帮助下，这个新干部向贴大字报的群众检讨了自己的错误。公司革命委员会主任王毓秀在工作上每次遇到困难问题，新干部都鼓励他、支持他搞好工作。有一次公司接到支援外地的运输任务，王毓秀怕自己刚站出来，群众不会听他调动，没想到他一说明情况，一位新干部就亲自带着工人出车执行任务去了。王毓秀看到新干部和革命群众坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，受到很大的感动，工作上更加积极负责，一直同新干部合作得很好。
    革命委员会中原来属于两派群众组织的委员，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作祟，在工作中发生意见分歧时，就联想到过去打“内战”的情形，互相猜疑，互不服气。在各场的车队成立革命领导小组时，有的委员不是站在无产阶级党性的立场上，从全局和整体利益出发，而是从资产阶级、小资产阶级派性出发，为小团体利益争权，争席位。针对这个问题，支左的解放军同志帮助他们学习毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，在全公司展开了围剿派性的“人民战争”。不少派性严重的革命委员会成员主动批判了自己
  “以老造反派自居”、“以我为核心”等错误思想，表示坚决听毛主席的话，“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人”。他们主动到群众中去做“消毒”工作，清除派性的影响，使各场的车队都顺利地建立起革命领导小组，全公司上上下下实现了一片红。原属两派组织的委员，互相间还经常在一起开生活会，开展谈心活动，一起忆阶级苦，批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线的罪行。现在，这个公司各级革命委员会中原属两派组织的委员，基本上能做到按照无产阶级党性原则办事，思想感情越来越接近了。
    革命委员会成立以后，同广大革命群众建立什么样的关系？这是一个十分重要的问题。毛主席关于“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系”的最新指示，给这个公司各级革命委员会的成员指明了方向。他们反复地学习“老三篇”，反复地学习毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，一致认为，必须把革命委员会建设成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的非常革命化的战斗集体，所有成员都要
  “既当‘官’，又当老百姓”。他们以普通劳动者的身份在群众中出现，和群众同吃，同住，同学习，同劳动。各级革命委员会和革命领导小组都建立了干部参加劳动的制度，很多委员都坚持在原岗位从事生产和工作。有些分工抓车间和车队工作的常委和委员，在实行领导的同时，又以一个普通工人的身份，顶班生产，不迟到，不早退，担子拣重的挑。他们同广大群众紧密地联系在一起，同群众建立起深厚的阶级感情，密切了干群关系。
