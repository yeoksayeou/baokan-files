	Coordinating with U.S. Imperialist Military Forces' Eastward Shift, Betraying the Interests of the German and European Peoples
	The Soviet Revisionists and West German Militarism in Cahoots

	BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) — While closely coordinating with U.S. imperialism in suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially in jointly sabotaging the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, the Soviet revisionist leadership is also playing the role of U.S. imperialism's henchman in Europe. They are intensifying their attempts to pull and collude with the West German militarist forces, which harbor expansionist ambitions, in an attempt to maintain the imperialist, capitalist, and revisionist counter-revolutionary rule in Europe.

	West German militarism was nurtured by U.S. imperialism after World War II, and the latter has been using it as a tool to control Western Europe and invade Eastern Europe. West Germany has been used as a bridgehead for U.S. imperialism to carry out subversive activities and implement its "peaceful" infiltration policy against Eastern European countries. The Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to coordinate with the eastward shift of U.S. imperialist military forces and to establish so-called "peace and security" to maintain the counter-revolutionary order in Europe, is further discarding its mask of opposing West German militarism. It is openly and covertly colluding with the West German ruling clique.

	In recent periods, the Soviet revisionist clique's collusion with West German militarism has become increasingly close, with frequent contacts between Moscow and Bonn. It is reported that West German Foreign Minister Brandt and the Soviet Ambassador to West Germany have held "frequent talks" recently, one of whose contents is to make some kind of "renunciation of the use of force declaration" between the two countries. Western news agencies commented that "such talks are extremely secretive," and the "contacts" between the two sides are "fruitful." Moscow "has so far avoided bringing the dispute into the discussion." The West German "Bonn Review" shouted that if there were no German Democratic Republic, Moscow's "entire plan with Bonn could be quickly implemented." Meanwhile, the Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic began "secret talks" with West Berlin Mayor Schultz in January this year, "detailedly explaining Russia's new Berlin plan" to him. Schultz later expressed that the talks would "continue," and his impression was that "Russia does not want a new Berlin crisis" and that the Soviet Union "hopes to maintain the status quo of this city." The British "Daily Telegraph" commented: "The Russians seem to want to establish 'a quiet area' in Berlin. This would allow them to free up their hands to concentrate on other issues, such as the Vietnam issue and the China issue."

	It should be pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership's actions are a further development of their intensified collusion with West German militarism over the past few years. As early as 1966, the Soviet revisionist leadership expressed in an official government communiqué that the Soviet revisionists wanted to "improve" relations with West Germany and advocated "overcoming past mistrust." Since then, the Soviet side has repeatedly expressed in official documents its desire to develop "good relations" with West Germany. According to Western media reports, Soviet leader Kosygin recently wrote a letter to the West German government discussing the possibility and conditions for "easing" the situation in Europe. Western media believe that this is a major "friendly gesture" made by the Soviet Union to West Germany. It is under such circumstances that for more than a year, there has been a constant stream of people between the Soviet Union and West Germany. West German ruling party "foreign affairs experts" and other "social activists" have continuously gone to Moscow for "exploration," while the Soviet Union's large "journalist delegation" and "trade union delegation" have successively been active in West Germany, and so on.

	The fact that Moscow and Bonn are getting along so well once again exposes the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique in surrendering to imperialism and betraying the interests of the European peoples.

	Everyone knows that the West German militarist forces, relying on the support of U.S. imperialism, have been plotting for more than a decade to annex the German Democratic Republic and expand into Eastern Europe. For this purpose, they have been vigorously expanding their military and preparing for war, raising a large army of revenge-seeking militarists. They have been constantly carrying out subversive and destructive activities against Eastern European countries, and they have been constantly issuing revenge cries and making reckless provocations. Just on March 4 this year, more than ten ministers of the West German government and 400 members of the West German parliament openly and brazenly entered West Berlin, which is located on the territory of the German Democratic Republic, for a week-long meeting. West German Chancellor Kissinger also frequently "visited" West Berlin to demonstrate their ambition to annex West Berlin. Faced with such a situation, the Soviet revisionist leaders actually sat on the same bench with the representatives of West German militarism to discuss what "not to use force" and to beg for the maintenance of the "quiet" status of West Berlin. This fully illustrates that they are sacrificing the interests of the people of the German Democratic Republic and other countries in Europe to appease and collude with West German militarism.

	Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "'Lifting a stone to drop on one's own feet,' this is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools." The Soviet revisionist leadership is just such a bunch of fools. Their criminal actions of colluding with West German militarist forces will inevitably arouse the revolutionary indignation of the European peoples and the German people who have suffered greatly from German militarism. The handful of jumping jacks, such as Brezhnev and Kosygin, who attempt to reverse the wheel of history, will ultimately become the sacrificial offerings of U.S. imperialism and West German militarism.

    配合美帝军事力量东移　出卖德国和欧洲人民利益
    苏修同西德军国主义眉来眼去打得火热
    新华社九日讯　苏修领导集团在密切配合美帝镇压亚非拉人民革命斗争，特别是共同破坏越南人民抗美救国斗争的同时，还在欧洲极力充当美帝帮凶，加紧拉拢和勾结怀有扩张野心的西德军国主义势力，妄图借以维护帝国主义、资本主义和修正主义在欧洲的反革命统治。
    西德军国主义是美帝在二次大战后一手扶植起来的，美帝一直利用它作为控制西欧、侵略东欧的工具，把西德作为向东欧国家进行颠覆活动，推行
  “和平”渗透政策的桥头堡。苏修领导集团为了配合美帝军事力量东移，在欧洲建立维持反革命“秩序”的所谓“和平与安全”，正在进一步抛弃它那副反对西德军国主义的假面具，明里暗里同西德统治集团眉来眼去，勾勾搭搭。
    最近一个时期，苏修集团同西德军国主义的勾搭越来越紧，莫斯科和波恩之间的接触十分频繁。据报道，西德外长勃兰特和苏联驻西德大使不久前举行了“频频的会谈”，其内容之一就是要在两国间搞一个什么“放弃使用武力声明”。西方通讯社在评论中指出，“这种会谈是极其秘密的”，双方的“接触”是“富有成果的”，莫斯科“迄今一直避免把争论带到讨论中去”。西德《波恩评论报》叫嚷说，如果没有德意志民主共和国，莫斯科同波恩的“全部计划就可以很快拿出来”。与此同时，苏联驻德意志民主共和国大使在今年一月间又开始了同西柏林市市长舒茨的“密谈”，向他“详细地解释俄国的新的柏林计划”。舒茨在事后表示，会谈将“继续进行”，他的印象是“俄国不希望出现新的柏林危机”，“苏联希望继续保持这个城市的现状”。英国《每日电讯报》在评论中指出：“俄国人看来想在柏林建立‘一个平静地区’。这样做，能使他们腾出手来，把精力集中在其他问题上，如越南问题和中国问题。”
    应该指出，苏修领导集团的这些行径是它几年来加紧勾结西德军国主义的进一步发展。早在一九六六年，苏修领导集团就以政府正式照会的方式表白苏修要“改善”同西德的关系，鼓吹“跨过过去造成的不信任。”此后，苏联方面又多次在正式文件中表示要同西德发展“良好关系”。据西方报刊透露，苏修头目柯西金不久前曾写信给西德政府，讨论“缓和”欧洲局势的可能性和条件。西方报刊认为，这是苏联向西德作出的一个重大的“友好姿态”。正是在这样的情况下，一年多来苏联和西德间人来人往络绎不绝。西德执政党的“外交事务专家”和其他“社会活动家”连续去莫斯科进行“探索”，而苏联庞大的“记者团”、“工会代表团”则先后到西德活动，等等。
    莫斯科同波恩之间打得如此火热，再一次暴露了苏修集团投降帝国主义、出卖欧洲人民利益的叛徒嘴脸。
    谁都知道，西德军国主义势力依仗着美帝的支持，十几年来一直在阴谋吞并德意志民主共和国和向东欧扩张。它们为此极力扩军备战，豢养了一支庞大的复仇主义的军队，它们对东欧国家不断进行颠覆破坏，它们还不断发出复仇叫嚷，进行狂妄挑衅。就在今年三月四日，西德政府的十几名部长和西德议会的四百名议员又公然大摇大摆地进入位于德意志民主共和国领土上的西柏林，举行为时一周的会议，西德总理基辛格也频繁“访问”西柏林，以显示他们吞并西柏林的野心。面对这种情况，苏修头目竟然同西德军国主义的代表人物坐在一条板凳上讨论什么“不使用武力”，乞求维持西柏林的“平静”，这就充分地说明了它们正在牺牲德意志民主共和国人民和欧洲其它各国人民的利益来安抚和勾结西德军国主义。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”苏修领导集团正是这样一批蠢人。它们同西德军国主义势力勾勾搭搭的罪恶行径，必将激起曾饱受德国军国主义残害的欧洲人民和德国人民的革命怒火。勃列日涅夫、柯西金等一小撮妄图扭转历史车轮的跳梁小丑，最终将成为美帝国主义和西德军国主义的殉葬品。
