In the past year, U.S. imperialism, through its puppet regime led by Balaguer, has intensified its infiltration and control over the Dominican Republic, brutally suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the Dominican people. However, the aggression and oppression by U.S. imperialism have awakened the Dominican people further, and their resistance against U.S. imperialism is growing stronger.

U.S. imperialism, through its puppet—the Balaguer dictatorship representing the big landlords and big bourgeoisie—has gained many new privileges. In the mining sector, U.S. corporations have obtained the right to exploit manganese mines over 24,000 hectares of land, and they are rapidly extracting iron ore in southern Dominican Republic at extremely low costs. U.S. monopolies are continuously sending personnel to the Dominican Republic to seek new investment opportunities and markets for their goods.

The ruthless plunder by U.S. imperialism has deepened the economic crisis in the Dominican Republic. In the past year, prices have soared, food is scarce, and foreign debt has risen sharply. The Balaguer dictatorship, to shift the economic crisis onto the Dominican working people, has taken a series of reactionary measures such as freezing wages and mass layoffs, resulting in over 400,000 unemployed.

To strangle the revolutionary struggles of the Dominican people, U.S. imperialism is adopting various vicious methods to intensify the suppression of revolutionary forces in the Dominican Republic. CIA agents are spread throughout the country, directly commanding the Dominican secret police to arrest and kill numerous revolutionaries. At the same time, the number of U.S. "Peace Corps" members has doubled, intensifying infiltration into rural areas.

The economic plunder and political oppression by U.S. imperialism have sparked more intense resistance from the Dominican people. Port workers in Santo Domingo have joined the struggle, protesting against unfair wage systems, and their fight has gained the support of a wide range of workers, students, and residents. Many factories and schools have established committees to support the port workers' struggle. Workers in the textile and tobacco industries have taken broad actions to demand the restoration of their rights; meanwhile, the broad masses of laboring people are increasingly strongly opposing the reactionary measures of the Balaguer dictatorship, such as freezing wages and laying off workers.

The struggles of the peasant masses in the Dominican Republic are also gradually developing. They seize the land from large landowners, resisting the savage exploitation by landlords and the government's various atrocities against peasants. The broad masses of young students are continually fighting against the government's cuts in educational funds and political persecution.

The revolutionary organizations in the Dominican Republic, the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" and the "People's Movement," after their armed struggle against the U.S. was temporarily defeated in 1965, have been continuously summarizing their experiences and accumulating revolutionary forces. They recognize that to achieve victory in the Dominican Revolution, they must take the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their guide and follow the path of armed seizure of power as indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao. They send their outstanding cadres to the countryside to propagate among the peasants and organize the peasants, and they have strengthened their ties with workers and other laboring masses. They are not only determined to carry out the revolutionary struggle against the U.S. and the dictatorship but also, to achieve victory in this revolution, recognize the importance of subjective world transformation, paying attention to eliminating bourgeois thought within the organization and establishing Mao Zedong Thought. It can be predicted that the revolutionary people of the Dominican Republic, in the new year, on the basis of further mastering the great Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely advance the revolutionary struggle in the Dominican Republic.

    美帝的侵略和压迫激起多米尼加人民的强烈反抗
    多米尼加人民反美反独裁斗争不断发展
    据新华社二十八日讯本社记者报道：在过去一年中，美帝国主义依靠它一手扶植起来的巴拉格傀儡政权，加紧对多米尼加的渗透和控制，残酷镇压多米尼加人民的革命斗争。但是，美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，促使多米尼加人民更加觉醒，他们对美帝国主义的反抗正在加强。
    美帝国主义通过它的傀儡——代表大地主、大资产阶级的巴拉格独裁政府，取得了许多新的特权。在矿业方面，美国财团取得了两万四千公顷土地的锰矿开采权，并且在多米尼加南部以极低的成本加速开采那里的铁矾土。美国垄断企业不断派出人员来到多米尼加，寻找新的投资场所和商品销售市场。
    美帝国主义的残酷掠夺加深了多米尼加的经济危机。在过去一年中，多米尼加物价飞涨，食品奇缺，外债急剧上升。巴拉格独裁政府为了转嫁经济危机，加紧向多米尼加劳动人民开刀，它采取了冻结工资、大批解雇工人等一系列的反动措施，使失业人数达四十万之多。
    美帝国主义为了扼杀多米尼加人民的革命斗争，正在采取种种恶毒手段，加紧对多米尼加的革命力量进行镇压。美国中央情报局的特务遍布多米尼加，直接指挥多米尼加特务机构，逮捕和杀害大批革命者。与此同时，美国“和平队”的人数也增加了一倍，加紧对农村的渗透。
    美帝国主义的经济掠夺和政治压迫促使多米尼加人民更激烈的反抗。圣多明各港口工人纷纷投入斗争，抗议不合理的工资制度，他们的斗争得到广大工人、学生和居民的支持，不少工厂、学校成立了支援港口工人斗争的委员会。纺织和烟草等业的工人曾广泛行动起来，要求恢复被剥夺了的权利；与此同时，广大劳动人民越来越猛烈地反对巴拉格独裁政权所采取的冻结工资、解雇工人等反动措施。
    多米尼加农民群众的斗争也在逐渐开展。他们夺取大庄园主的土地，反抗地主的野蛮剥削和政府迫害农民的种种暴行。广大青年学生为反对政府削减教育经费和对他们的政治迫害不断展开斗争。
    多米尼加的革命组织
  “六月十四日革命运动”和“人民运动”在一九六五年反美武装斗争暂时遭到失败之后，不断总结斗争经验，积蓄革命力量。他们认识到：要取得多米尼加革命的胜利，必须以战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为斗争的指南，走伟大领袖毛主席所指引的武装夺取政权的道路。他们把自己的优秀干部派往农村，进行宣传农民和组织农民的工作，并且加强了与工人和其他劳动群众的联系。他们不仅决心进行反美反独裁的革命斗争，而且为了胜利地进行这一革命，认识到主观世界改造的重要性，注意在组织内部破资产阶级思想，立毛泽东思想。可以预料，多米尼加革命人民在新的一年中，在进一步掌握伟大的毛泽东思想的基础上，必定会把多米尼加的革命斗争向前推进一步。
