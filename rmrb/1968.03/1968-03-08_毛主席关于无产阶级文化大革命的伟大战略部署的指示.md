Our great leader Chairman Mao on March 7, 1967, made the famous "March 7th Directive" regarding the great strategic deployment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in response to the report "Tianjin Yanan Middle School's Experience in Achieving School-wide Unity and Strengthening, Consolidating, and Developing the Red Guards Based on Teaching Classes." To commemorate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's great directive, the full text is reprinted below.

"The March 7th Directive" reads as follows:

To Comrades Lin Biao, Zhou Enlai, and the Cultural Revolution Group:

This document can be circulated nationwide for reference and implementation. The army should, in phases and batches, conduct military training for universities, middle schools, and high-grade primary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, reorganizing organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership organs, and carrying out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. First, conduct pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually promote them. It is also necessary to persuade students to follow Marx's teaching that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself. During military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes, except for the elderly and the sick. Let these people participate, which will be beneficial for their reform. All these tasks, if done seriously, are not difficult to solve.

Mao Zedong
March 7, 1967

    毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署的指示
    新华社七日讯　我们伟大导师毛主席于一九六七年三月七日，对于《天津延安中学以教学班为基础，实现全校大联合和整顿、巩固、发展红卫兵的体会》这一个报告，作了有关无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署的著名的“三·七”指示。为纪念毛主席这个伟大指示一周年，现将全文重新发表。“三·七”指示全文如下：林彪、恩来、文革小组各同志：此件似可转发全国，参照执行。军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。先作试点，取得经验，逐步推广。还要说服学生，实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导，在军训时不要排斥犯错误的教师和干部。除老年和生病的以外，要让这些人参加，以利改造。所有这些，只要认真去做，问题并不难解决。毛泽东三月七日
