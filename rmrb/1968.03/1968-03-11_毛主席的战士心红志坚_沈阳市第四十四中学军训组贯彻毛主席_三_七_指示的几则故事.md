	It is Chairman Mao who told me to do this

	The revolutionary great alliance and the resumption of classes for revolutionary struggle in Class 1, Grade 1 were in full swing. Students said: The comrades from the People's Liberation Army have armed us with Mao Zedong Thought, a red heart has moved us, and our hearts have come together.

	Originally, Comrade Yang Zhixin, who was in charge of the military training for Class 1, Grade 1, had a problem with his spine. The doctor wanted him to be hospitalized for treatment. He thought: Military training is a battle to propagate, implement, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I cannot leave the students, and the students do not want to leave me. I am a Communist Party member, and in the face of difficulties, I must stand firm.

	At night, he couldn't sleep because of the pain in his waist, so he recited the "Three Articles"; during the day, he carried a hot water bottle to warm his waist and insisted on going to the classroom. When students asked him, he smiled and said, "For the convenience of drinking water."

	The military training began. Due to the sabotage by class enemies, only seven students came to class. This worried Yang Zhixin. To convey Chairman Mao's instructions to the revolutionary teachers and students in a timely manner, he carried Chairman Mao's book in his chest and visited students' homes on holidays. Every day, he endured the pain and walked dozens of miles, visiting six or seven families. In more than two months, he visited all 51 students in the class. Once, he went to Jiaoyongxia's home. Halfway there, the pain in his waist was so severe that he could hardly stand it. But when he thought of Mao Zedong's good student Jia Yulu visiting poor peasants' homes in the snow, he made up his mind: Persistence is victory! He used both hands to support his waist and repeated to himself, "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He persisted and walked on. When he arrived at Jiaoyongxia's home, the beads of sweat on his face had not been wiped off, and he took out the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from his chest and started studying with Jiaoyongxia and her entire family. Jiaoyongxia's father is an old worker. When he learned that Yang Zhixin had come to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions despite his illness, he was so moved that he shed tears. He tightly grasped Yang Zhixin's hand and said excitedly, "The comrades from the People's Liberation Army are truly reliable!" Yang Zhixin replied, "It is Chairman Mao who told me to do this."

	The Guide to Self-Criticism

	Once, during a criticism meeting in Class 4, Grade 3, Xing Zhenguo was still playing basketball. Comrade Peng Jianxiu, the leader of the military training team, went to stop him, but he did not listen and used the basketball to pass it over Peng's head, saying angrily, "Without you, we can still train!" Peng Jianxiu got angry at Xing Zhenguo.

	That night, Peng Jianxiu lay in bed, and his mind kept racing. He was not thinking about Xing Zhenguo's attitude towards him, but felt that his attitude towards Xing Zhenguo was not good. Why was he so angry at that time? It was still the "self" at work, feeling that as a cadre, Xing Zhenguo was making a fool of him in front of so many teachers and students, feeling that he could not come down from the stage, could not put down his pride.

	The next day after breakfast, Peng Jianxiu came to the classroom. First, he studied with everyone the teachings of Chairman Mao: "Because we are serving the people, so if we have shortcomings, we should not be afraid of others pointing them out." Then, he examined his shortcomings, fought against his selfishness, and sincerely sought the opinions of the teachers and students. As soon as he finished speaking, Xing Zhenguo stood up and said emotionally, "Don't say anymore, it's all my fault. I was influenced by the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, deliberately disrupting other organizations' meetings, deliberately giving the People's Liberation Army a hard time. In the future, I will definitely not say anything that is not beneficial to the great alliance and not do anything that is not beneficial to the great alliance."

	The teacher of this class, Teacher Ru, also could not sit still. He voluntarily examined his past shortcomings of not having deep feelings for the students and not caring enough about the great alliance in the class, and expressed his willingness to contribute to the great alliance in the class.

	Then, the whole class discussed the issue of the great alliance in the class. Everyone made self-criticisms, quickly eliminated the barriers, and achieved the revolutionary great alliance. The students excitedly said: The self-criticism path guided by the People's Liberation Army is good, and it has removed the ideological obstacles for the class to achieve the revolutionary great alliance.

	Building a "Wall of Prevention" in Thought

	Cai Shuntang is a new soldier who enlisted in 1966. He helped the teachers and students in Class 2, Grade 1 with military training and got along very well with the Red Guards. The students affectionately called him "Little Cai."

	Some classrooms had broken glass in the doors and windows, and the cold wind blew in, making it chilly. Some students said, "When the north wind blows, I will go home." Little Cai thought: It's getting colder day by day, and the classroom needs to be repaired. What should we do? At this time, the Party branch of the military training team mobilized everyone to actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "save and make revolution," carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, overcome difficulties, and resolutely do a good job in military training and the resumption of classes for revolutionary struggle. Little Cai immediately organized the teachers and students in the class to study.

	"The educational policy of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University is: firm and correct political direction, hardworking and simple work style, flexible and mobile strategy and tactics. These three aspects are indispensable for creating a revolutionary soldier who fights against Japan." Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated the hearts of the Red Guards. They all expressed: We little red soldiers listen to Chairman Mao the most. We must carry forward the excellent revolutionary traditions of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, walk the path of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and establish an Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-style school. We will not spend a single penny and repair the school buildings ourselves, using Mao Zedong Thought to build a "wall of prevention" in our minds. After studying Chairman Mao's teachings and seeing the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, Little Cai suddenly felt enlightened and his confidence soared.

	One afternoon, the comrades from the military training team and the teachers and students were repairing the classroom as usual. Everyone was busy when Little Cai suddenly noticed a crack at the junction of the wall, the wall was leaning out, and the soil was falling down. The revolutionary teachers and students were in danger of being hit. What should he do? At this critical moment, Little Cai heard Chairman Mao's teachings in his ears: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people..." The images of heroes Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang appeared before him. In an instant, he felt that his body was filled with boundless strength. He dashed forward and used his body to prop up the wall, raised both hands to support the top of the wall, and while strenuously resisting the collapsing wall, he shouted, "Students, quickly get out of the way! Quickly!" The Red Guards saw this scene and did not want to leave. They also rushed forward...

	The cracked wall was repaired, and the "wall of prevention" was built. The teachers and students excitedly said, "The People's Liberation Army helped us build a 'wall of prevention' in our minds."

　　——沈阳市第四十四中学军训组贯彻毛主席“三·七”指示的几则故事
　　向阳
    是毛主席叫我这样做的
    初一（一）班的革命大联合、复课闹革命搞得热火朝天，同学们都说：解放军同志用毛泽东思想武装了我们，一颗红心感动了我们，使我们的心贴到一起了。
    原来，担任初一（一）班军训任务的杨芝新同志腰脊椎骨有了毛病，医生要他住院治疗。他心想：军训是一场宣传、贯彻和捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗，我离不开同学，同学也不愿离开我。我是一个共产党员，在困难面前，一定要顶得住。
    夜间，他腰疼得睡不着，就背诵“老三篇”；白天，背个热水壶暖腰，坚持到班上去，同学们问他时，他笑呵呵地说：“为了喝水方便。”
    军训开始了，由于阶级敌人的破坏，班上只来了七名同学。这可急坏了杨芝新。他为了把毛主席的指示及时传达给革命师生，怀里揣着毛主席的书，利用节日假日到学生家里访问。他每天忍痛步行几十里，访问六、七家，两个多月，走遍了全班五十一名同学的家。一次，他去焦永霞同学家，走到半路，腰疼得厉害，有些坚持不住了。可是，当他想到毛主席的好学生焦裕禄在风雪天到老贫农家里的情景，便暗暗下定决心：坚持就是胜利！他两只手紧紧地撑着腰部，心里默念着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”坚持走下去。到了焦永霞的家，脸上豆粒似的汗珠还没擦，就从怀里掏出红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和焦永霞全家一起学习起来。焦永霞的父亲是老工人，当知道杨芝新带病来宣传毛主席的最新指示时，感动得流下泪来。他紧握着杨芝新的手激动地说：“解放军同志真过硬！”杨芝新回答说：“是毛主席叫我这样做的。”
    自我批评的引路人
    一次，初三（四）班开批判会，邢振国同学还在那里玩篮球。军训组组长彭建修同志去劝阻，他不听，还用篮球在老彭的头上传来传去，气冲冲地说：“没有你们，我们一样军训。”彭建修听了，对邢振国也发了火。
    晚上，彭建修躺在床上脑子里不住地翻腾，他想的不是邢振国对自己的态度，而是感到自己对邢振国态度不好。当时火气为什么那么大呢？还是“私”字在作怪，觉得自己是领导干部，邢振国在这么多师生面前戏弄自己，感到下不来台，放不下架子。
    第二天吃罢早饭，彭建修来到班上。先和大家一块学习毛主席的教导：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”接着，他检查了缺点，狠斗了私心，诚恳地征求师生的意见。话音刚落，邢振国霍地站起来感动地说：“不要说了，都是我的错，我是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，故意扰乱别的组织开会，故意给解放军出难题。今后我一定做到不利于大联合的话不说，不利于大联合的事不做。”
    这个班的茹老师也坐不住了，主动检查了过去对同学感情不深，对班上大联合关心不够的缺点，表示要为班上的大联合做出贡献。
    接着，全班同学在一起讨论班级大联合的问题。各自都做了自我批评，很快就消除了隔阂，实现了革命大联合。同学们兴奋地说：解放军自我批评的路引得好，为班上实现革命大联合扫除了思想障碍。
    筑起思想上的“防修墙”
    蔡顺堂是一九六六年入伍的新战士，他在初一（二）班帮助师生搞军训，跟红卫兵小将处得很熟，同学们都亲热地管他叫“小蔡”。
    有的教室门窗上的玻璃坏了，冷风吹进来，冷嗖嗖的。有的同学说：“北风一刮，我就回家。”小蔡心想：一天比一天冷了，教室也要整修，怎么办呢？这时，军训组党支部动员大家积极响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，发扬“抗大”革命精神，战胜困难，坚决搞好军训和复课闹革命。小蔡马上组织班里师生进行学习。
      “抗大的教育方针是：坚定正确的政治方向，艰苦朴素的工作作风，灵活机动的战略战术。这三者是造成一个抗日的革命的军人所不可缺的。”毛主席的教导照亮了红卫兵的心。他们纷纷表示：我们红小兵最听毛主席的话，一定要发扬“抗大”的优良革命传统，走“抗大”的道路，办“抗大”式的学校，不花一分钱，自己动手修校舍，用毛泽东思想在头脑里筑起一道“防修墙”。学习了毛主席的教导，看到红卫兵小将的革命精神，小蔡顿时觉得心明眼亮，信心倍增。
    一天下午，军训组的同志和师生们跟往常一样在修整教室。大家正忙得起劲，小蔡忽然发现墙接头的地方裂了一道缝，墙往外倒，土往下掉，革命师生眼看就有被砸的危险。怎么办？在这千钧一发的时候，小蔡耳边响起了毛主席的教导：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。……”张思德、白求恩、王杰、刘英俊、蔡永祥等英雄形象出现在他的眼前，刹那间他感到浑身增添了无穷的力量，一个箭步窜上去，用身体顶住墙面，高举起双手托住墙头，一面奋力抵住要倒的墙壁，一面喊：“同学们，快闪开！快！”红卫兵小将一见这情景，哪里肯走，也都一拥而上……
    裂开的墙缝补好了，“防修墙”修好了。师生们激动地说：“解放军帮助我们在思想上筑起一道‘防修墙’。”
