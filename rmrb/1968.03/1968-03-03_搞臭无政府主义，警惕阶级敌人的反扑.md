Chairman Mao teaches us: "Anarchy does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people."

Recently, reporters from this newspaper visited several factories in the Beijing textile system. With the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factories to support the left, several meetings were held. Revolutionary workers, upon mentioning anarchism, expressed deep hatred and loathing, especially the old workers who had suffered oppression and exploitation in the old society. With deep class feelings of limitless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they used vivid facts to launch a fierce attack on the reactionary anarchism. They declared: They will definitely firmly carry out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," definitely drive out the evil wind of anarchism, and firmly establish proletarian spirit. Below are excerpts from the speeches of some comrades at the meeting.

Exposing anarchism is a serious combat task facing the proletariat today. Some people now say: Having a bit of freedom, being a little late for work, skipping a few days, these are minor things, no big deal, why make a fuss! Those who say these things, if not out of confusion, are certainly up to no good.

Not long ago, revolutionary masses in Beijing's Fengtai District exposed a person who disrupted social order. Upon investigation, it turned out to be one of our factory workers who had been on long-term "sick leave." In nearly half a year, he ran from one hospital to another, obtaining sick leave certificates, and during his "rest" time, he wandered around with bad elements in society, doing things harmful to social order. Before this matter was exposed, our thinking was very complacent. We thought he was just a bit lax in labor discipline, liked to "soak in the mud," and did not ask about his long-term absence from the factory. In fact, this person also spread words to disrupt labor discipline in the factory. Looking back now, some bad elements took advantage of the gap of "lax labor discipline, no big deal." This is no small matter!

Chairman Mao teaches us: Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat; they will make their last struggle. A handful of capitalist roaders within the Party have been overthrown by us, and counter-revolutionary economism has been exposed. The enemy is using anarchism to disperse our revolutionary organizations, undermine the combat effectiveness of our revolutionary ranks, damage the authority of the proletarian revolution, weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat, and attempt to obstruct our comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Anarchism is a means by which the bourgeoisie is making a frantic counterattack against the proletariat. If we relax our vigilance, we will fall into the trap of the class enemy.

Revolutionary workers are the main force of socialist revolution and construction. We must manage the behavior of anarchism; if we do not manage it, we are supporting the enemy. Those who seriously harm social order must be subjected to the dictatorship of the proletariat, and those influenced by anarchist thoughts must be patiently educated and helped. We are workers with relatively long production experience. In the old society, we suffered deeply from the exploitation and oppression of capitalists. We must cherish and care for the young people, especially care for their political and ideological growth, and cultivate them into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause who meet Chairman Mao's requirements.

    搞臭无政府主义，警惕阶级敌人的反扑

    毛主席教导我们：“无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望。”
    最近，本报记者访问了北京纺织系统的一些工厂，在驻厂支左的人民解放军帮助下，召开了一些座谈会。广大革命职工一提到无政府主义，无不深恶痛绝，尤其是在旧社会饱受了压迫和剥削的老工人，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，用活生生的事实，对反动的无政府主义痛加围剿。他们表示：一定坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，一定把无政府主义歪风打下去，把无产阶级正气牢牢树起来。下面是座谈会上部分同志的发言摘要。
    搞臭无政府主义，是当前摆在我们工人阶级面前的一个严肃的战斗任务。现在有些人说：搞点小自由，上班迟到一点，旷上几天工，都是小事情，没有什么了不起，何必大惊小怪！说这些话的人，如果不是出于糊涂，就是别有用心。
    不久前北京丰台区的革命群众揪出了一个破坏社会治安的人，一查原来是我们工厂一个长期告“病假”的。在近半年的时间里，他从这个医院跑到那个医院，骗取病假休息证明，在“休息”时间他就到处乱串，伙同社会上的坏人，做危害社会治安的坏事。在这件事情没有揭发以前，我们思想上很麻痹，总以为他不过是劳动纪律松弛一些，爱“泡蘑菇”，对他长期离厂在家“休息”也不过问。其实，这个人在厂里也不断散布一些破坏劳动纪律的话。现在回过头来想想，有些坏人正是钻了“劳动纪律松弛没啥”的空子，这哪里是小事情呢？！
    毛主席教导我们：帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。党内一小撮走资派被我们打倒了，反革命经济主义被揭露了，敌人就假手于无政府主义来涣散我们的革命组织，瓦解我们革命队伍的战斗力，损害无产阶级革命权威，削弱无产阶级专政，妄图阻碍我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。无政府主义是当前资产阶级向无产阶级进行疯狂反扑的一种手段。我们如果放松警惕，就会上阶级敌人的当。
    革命工人是社会主义革命和建设的主力军，对无政府主义的行为一定要管，如果看到不管就是支持了敌人。对那些严重危害社会治安的坏人要实行无产阶级专政，对某些受无政府主义思想影响的人要耐心地教育帮助。我们都是参加生产年限比较长的工人，在旧社会深受资本家的剥削压迫；我们对青年人要爱护，要关心，特别要从政治思想上关心他们的成长，培养他们成为符合毛主席要求的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
