	Revolutionary committees have been established. What should support-left personnel do?

	The experience of the support-left personnel of the 4619 Unit is: the fundamental tasks of "three supports, two militaries" do not change; the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions does not change; the spirit of being a student of the masses does not change; the insistence on the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style does not change.

	According to a report from our newspaper, the Party Committee of the 4619 Unit of the People's Liberation Army recently convened a meeting with support-left personnel to discuss the work of support-left personnel after the establishment of revolutionary committees in the units they support. During the meeting, everyone seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and related works, reviewed the one-year-plus Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, analyzed the current excellent situation, summarized the experience of support-left work, and clarified the tasks and direction for better completing the "three supports, two militaries" in the future.

	The meeting believed that the fundamental task of "three supports, two militaries" is to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and to propagate and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Under any circumstances, this fundamental task must not be forgotten. Currently, the majority of units supported by the 4619 Unit have established revolutionary committees. In this new situation, some support-left personnel have had a tendency to relax, with some busy with administrative work and neglecting the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought to the masses. However, the class enemies are unwilling to accept their defeat and continue to carry out sabotage, with some creating counter-revolutionary public opinion, attempting to dismantle the revolutionary committees.

	Through the discussion, the support-left personnel unanimously recognized that the establishment of revolutionary committees is "only the first step of the Long March of ten thousand li." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a sharp and complex class struggle. After the establishment of revolutionary committees, the focal point of the life-and-death struggle between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces remains the issue of power. Therefore, any complacency and relaxation are extremely dangerous. In the new situation, support-left personnel should particularly strengthen their class struggle consciousness, continually arm themselves and the broad leftist masses with Mao Zedong Thought. They should take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, vigorously organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and strive to help various levels of revolutionary committees and proletarian revolutionary factions carry out the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, continually consolidating and improving the newly established revolutionary committees, and enhancing the revolutionary nature, representativeness, and authority of the revolutionary committees. Support-left personnel should, as always, be good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and do everything possible to assist the revolutionary committees in turning their units into vibrant Mao Zedong Thought schools.

	The discussion proposed that after the establishment of revolutionary committees, the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions must be continued, and the struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism must be carried out. Support-left personnel must first guard against being influenced by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. They must educate revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations not to bring bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism into the revolutionary committees and prevent class enemies from using bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist tendencies within the revolutionary ranks to sabotage the newly established revolutionary committees from within. Military support-left personnel should support and rely on the revolutionary committees, model the execution of revolutionary committee resolutions. They should help the revolutionary committees to seize power with proletarian party spirit, opposing the seizure of power with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

	Chairman Mao teaches: "In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around and see for themselves, adhere to the mass line, and consult with the masses on everything, and be students of the masses." After support-left personnel are integrated into various levels of revolutionary committees, their status has changed. In this situation, what should be done? During the discussion, everyone believed that in the past, the military was in a supporting position, mainly relying on the proletarian revolutionary factions of the units to handle work; after assuming a leading position, it is necessary to come up with ideas and solutions. However, the military support-left personnel are not very familiar with local work and must continue to be good students of the masses, not acting as leaders, consulting with the masses on everything, and conducting more investigations among the masses to quickly familiarize themselves with the new work, and to mobilize the broad masses to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and do a good job in the revolution and production of their units. In short, regardless of changes in position and status, the spirit of being a student of the masses must not change. Without this, no work can be done well.

	The discussion also mentioned that in the future, the consciousness of class struggle must be strengthened, and class struggle must be firmly grasped. At the same time, it must be seen that the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have undergone the test of the storm and stress of class struggle in more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary factions have unprecedentedly expanded and strengthened, and the cadre ranks have become purer and more revolutionary. Only by firmly believing in and relying on the broad revolutionary masses and the majority of cadres can the initiative and creativity of the people be maximized to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

	The comrades participating in the discussion believed that the broad revolutionary masses have great trust and love for the People's Liberation Army. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, after some support-left personnel participate in the work of revolutionary committees, the broad revolutionary masses treat the People's Liberation Army as their learning example even more. The actions and words of support-left personnel will have a great political influence on the broad masses. Therefore, the military must firmly grasp the ideological transformation of support-left personnel. Support-left personnel should continue to carry forward the fine tradition of the military in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing politics, insisting on the Four Firsts, and promoting the Three-Eight Style, always setting an example with their actions, and doing a good job in everything to make the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army deeply rooted in the local areas. This is how new achievements can be made for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 宣传毛泽东思想  落实毛主席最新指示

    革命委员会成立后支左人员应该怎么办？
    宣传毛泽东思想  落实毛主席最新指示
    四六一九部队支左人员的经验是：“三支”“两军”的根本任务不变；支左不支派的原则不变；甘当群众小学生的精神不变；坚持四个第一和三八作风不变
    本报讯　人民解放军四六一九部队党委最近召集支左人员，就支左部队所在单位成立革命委员会以后支左人员的工作问题举行了座谈。在座谈会上，大家认真学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示和有关著作，回顾了一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命运动，分析了当前的大好形势，总结了支左工作的经验，明确了今后更好地完成“三支”“两军”的任务和方向。
    座谈会认为，“三支”“两军”的根本任务，就是用毛泽东思想武装群众，宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示。在任何情况下，都不能忘记这一根本任务。目前，四六一九部队负责支左的单位绝大部分已经成立了革命委员会。在这样新的形势下，部分支左人员一度产生了松劲情绪，有的支左人员整天忙于事务性的工作，放松了向群众宣传毛泽东思想。可是，阶级敌人不甘心自己的失败，还在继续进行破坏，有的大造反革命舆论，妄想拆革命委员会的台。
    通过座谈，支左人员一致认识到，成立革命委员会，“只是万里长征走完了第一步”。无产阶级文化大革命是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，成立革命委员会以后，反革命同革命势力拚死斗争的焦点仍然是政权问题。因此，任何麻痹思想和松劲情绪都是十分危险的。在新的形势下，支左人员尤其应当加强阶级斗争观念，不断地用毛泽东思想武装自己和左派广大群众。要以毛主席的最新指示为纲，大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，努力帮助各级革命委员会和无产阶级革命派搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改，不断巩固、完善新生的革命委员会，增强革命委员会的革命性、代表性和权威性。支左人员要一如既往地当好毛泽东思想宣传员，尽一切努力协助革命委员会把所在单位办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    座谈中提出，革命委员会建立以后，必须继续贯彻支左不支派的原则，坚持开展对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的斗争。支左人员首先要防止自己受资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的影响，要教育革命干部和革命群众组织负责人不要把资产阶级、小资产阶级派性带进革命委员会，要防止阶级敌人利用革命队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮，从内部破坏新生的革命委员会。部队支左人员要支持和依靠革命委员会，模范地执行革命委员会的决议。要帮助革命委员会用无产阶级党性掌权，反对用资产阶级、小资产阶级派性掌权。
    毛主席教导说：“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”支左人员被结合到各级革命委员会以后，地位发生了变化，在这种情况下应该怎么办？座谈中大家认为，过去部队处于支持的地位，主要是依靠所在单位的无产阶级革命派处理工作；处于领导地位以后，就需要出主意，想办法。而部队支左人员对地方工作还不太熟悉，必须继续当好群众的小学生，不以领导者自居，遇事多和群众商量，多向群众作调查，才能较快地熟悉新的工作，才能很好地发动广大群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，搞好本单位的革命和生产。总之，职务、地位不论怎样改变，甘当群众小学生的精神不能变。没有这一条，是什么工作也做不好的。
    座谈当中还谈到，今后要继续加强阶级斗争观念，狠抓阶级斗争。同时要看到，广大的革命群众和革命干部在一年多的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，经受了阶级斗争疾风暴雨的考验，无产阶级革命派的队伍空前发展壮大，干部队伍也更加纯洁，更加富有革命的朝气。只有坚定不移地相信和依靠广大的革命群众，相信和依靠干部的大多数，才能最大限度地调动人民群众的积极性和创造性，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    参加座谈会的同志认为，广大革命群众对人民解放军非常信任，非常热爱。随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，一些支左人员参加了革命委员会的工作以后，广大革命群众更是处处把人民解放军当做自己学习的榜样。支左人员的一举一动，一言一行，都会在广大群众中间产生巨大的政治影响。因此，部队要狠抓支左人员的思想革命化。支左人员要继续发扬部队活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的优良传统，时时刻刻以身作则，事事处处作好榜样，使人民解放军的优良传统深深地在地方扎下根子。这才能为无产阶级文化大革命运动建立新功。
