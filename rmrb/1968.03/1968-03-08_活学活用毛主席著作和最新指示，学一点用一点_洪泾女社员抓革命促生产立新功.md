The women of Hongqing Brigade in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, a nationally renowned unit for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have earnestly carried forward the revolutionary study style of combining theory with practice as advocated by Chairman Mao. They study Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions bit by bit and apply them bit by bit, striving to transform their worldviews and make new contributions to the revolution and production. Currently, over 70 percent of the activists who study Chairman Mao's works and 60 percent of the five-good members in the brigade are women.

The women of Hongqing Brigade have deeply felt from their own experiences that without the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, there would be no today for the laboring women. Therefore, they have deep class sentiments for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They say, Chairman Mao's books are so dear to our hearts. Overcoming the difficulties of low cultural level, heavy housework, and busy production, they eagerly and seriously study Chairman Mao's works. Taking Gu Atao, a nationally renowned activist for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, as their model, they learn to read if they are illiterate; they find ways to make time if they are busy with housework and production. They study before work, recite while walking, discuss during breaks, review after work, and think about it before sleep, using the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains, bit by bit engraving Chairman Mao's works in their minds.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it; the purpose of mastering it is entirely for application." The women of Hongqing Brigade follow Chairman Mao's teachings, targeting the "self" in their minds, and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively in revolution and production. They learn a bit, use a bit, study hard, and apply hard, becoming vanguards in criticizing and repudiating oneself and fighters in criticizing and repudiating revisionism. They dare to expose their private thoughts without shame, dare to criticize and repudiate themselves without fear of pain, and dare to make a revolution in the depths of their souls.

The women of Hongqing follow Chairman Mao's instruction: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." They actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, launching a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev. From women in their seventies and eighties to girls in their teens, everyone participates in the revolutionary criticism. Together with the broad masses of community members, they fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious," "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and "material incentives," repelling the counter-revolutionary wind of economism blown by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, turning the fields, courtyards, and homes into battlegrounds for anti-revisionism and guarding against revisionism.

They follow Chairman Mao's great guideline of "grasp revolution, promote production," channeling the surging enthusiasm released from the Cultural Revolution into production. They break conventions, go on boats to dredge mud, and take on heavy work, greatly promoting production in the past winter and this spring. The women of the 14th production team braved temperatures of minus five to six degrees Celsius, singing the song of the slogan "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and worked continuously for four days to finish all the cotton ridges. In the battle of "criticizing and repudiating oneself and criticizing and repudiating revisionism," the women cadres of Hongqing set an example by taking the lead.

    活学活用毛主席著作和最新指示，学一点用一点
    洪泾女社员抓革命促生产立新功
    据新华社南京七日电　全国著名的活学活用毛主席著作先进单位——江苏太仓县洪泾大队的广大劳动妇女，认真发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，对毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示学一点用一点，努力改造世界观，在革命和生产中作出新贡献。现在，全大队百分之七十以上的学习毛主席著作积极分子和百分之六十的五好社员都是妇女。
    洪泾大队的劳动妇女从自己的亲身经历中深深体会到，没有伟大领袖毛主席的领导，就没有劳动妇女的今天。因此，她们对伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有无限深厚的阶级感情。她们说，毛主席的宝书，字字句句都说到我们的心坎里。她们克服了文化低、家务重、生产忙等许多困难，如饥似渴地认真学习毛主席著作。她们以全国著名的活学活用毛主席著作积极分子顾阿桃老妈妈为榜样，不识字，就请人教；家务重、生产忙，就千方百计挤出时间。上工以前学一学，走在路上背一背，田头休息议一议，收工时候照一照，睡在床上想一想，用愚公移山的精神，一点一点把毛主席著作刻在脑子里。
    毛主席教导说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”洪泾大队的劳动妇女遵循毛主席的教导，针对自己头脑里的“私”字，带着革命和生产中的问题，活学活用毛主席著作，做到学一点，用一点，狠学狠用，成了斗私的尖兵，批修的闯将。她们亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕痛，勇于在灵魂深处闹革命。
    洪泾妇女遵循毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，积极投入无产阶级文化大革命运动，大造以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的反。从七、八十岁的老太婆到十来岁的小姑娘，人人都参加了革命的大批判，她们和广大社员一起，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”等反动谬论，击退了党内一小撮走资派刮起的反革命经济主义妖风，把田头、场头、家庭变成了反修、防修的战场。
    她们遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，把从文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上。她们打破惯例，下船罱泥，抢干重活，大大推动了去冬今春的生产。第十四生产队的妇女，冒着零下五、六度的严寒，高唱着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录歌，连续奋战四天，翻好了全部棉墒。在“斗私，批修”的战斗中，洪泾的妇女干部以身作则，走在前面。
