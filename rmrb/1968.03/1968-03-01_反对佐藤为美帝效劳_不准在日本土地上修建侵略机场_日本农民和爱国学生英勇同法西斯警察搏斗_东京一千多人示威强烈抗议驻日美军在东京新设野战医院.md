BEIJING, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the Oriental News Agency, 2,000 Japanese peasants and patriotic students held a rally in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, on Feb. 26 to oppose the Sato reactionary government's construction of the Sanrizuka Airport to assist U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Asia. The Sato reactionary government mobilized 2,000 fascist police to carry out a bloody suppression. The heroic Japanese peasants and students used revolutionary violence to resist counter-revolutionary violence and engaged in a fierce struggle with the fascist police.

Facing the armed police's atrocities, the peasants and students were fearless. They fought back with sticks and stones and seized a batch of police batons and two armored vehicles from the police. Some peasant women from Sanrizuka also joined the battle. The peasants and students' struggle powerfully struck back at the armed police's atrocities.

The leader of the Sanrizuka peasant movement, Tomura Kazuo, directed the counterattack against the police. Although he was seriously injured in the head, he still insisted on continuing the struggle and did not leave the front line.

The patriotic actions of Japanese peasants and students received strong support from the residents of Narita City. They strongly condemned the Sato reactionary government's fascist atrocities and threw stones at the police, fighting side by side with the peasants and students.

The fierce struggle lasted from 2 p.m. until evening. More than 100 peasants and students were injured, and 22 patriots were illegally arrested.

Tomura Kazuo commented on this struggle, saying: The Sato government mobilized a large number of armed police to suppress us, but we will not surrender. The Vietnamese people, facing the U.S. imperialists who possess modern weapons, have achieved great victories by persisting in people's war. The anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the Japanese people is reaching a climax. As long as we continue to struggle, the final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people.

BEIJING, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the Oriental News Agency, 1,200 Japanese youths, students, workers, and citizens held a rally in Tokyo on Feb. 27 to strongly oppose the U.S. forces in Japan setting up a new field hospital in Tokyo.

The rally exposed and condemned the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam and enthusiastically hailed the great victories of the people of South Vietnam in the spring offensive.

Japanese peasants opposing the expansion of U.S. bases, wearing Mao Zedong badges, participated in the rally. A peasant representative spoke at the meeting, saying that the Japanese people would never allow the Sato government to offer Japan to U.S. imperialism to be used as a base for aggression against Vietnam and Asia.

After the meeting, the participants held a demonstration. When the demonstration marched towards the U.S. military base in Tokyo, they were brutally suppressed by 1,500 Japanese police. The police beat and kicked the demonstrators and illegally arrested three patriotic youths on the spot.

The police's fascist atrocities aroused the indignation of many citizens. They shouted at the police, "Get out, lackeys of the U.S.!" "Traitors, shame on you!" At this time, the demonstration and the citizens gathered together, and the slogans merged into one, completely surrounding the armed police sent by the Sato government, making them extremely embarrassed.

    日本农民和爱国学生英勇同法西斯警察搏斗
    东京一千多人示威强烈抗议驻日美军在东京新设野战医院
    新华社二十七日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本农民和爱国学生两千人，二十六日在千叶县成田市举行大会，反对佐藤反动政府修建三里塚飞机场帮助美帝侵略亚洲的罪行。佐藤反动政府出动了两千名法西斯警察进行血腥的镇压，英雄的日本农民和学生用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，同法西斯警察展开了英勇的搏斗。
    面对着武装警察的暴行，农民和学生毫不畏惧，他们用木棍和石头进行反击，并从警察手中夺下了一批警棍和两辆装甲车。三里塚的一些农民妇女也投入了战斗。农民和学生的斗争有力地回击了武装警察的暴行。
    三里塚的农民运动领导人户村一作指挥了对警察的反击战。他虽然头部受到重伤，但是仍然坚持斗争，不下火线。
    日本农民和学生的爱国行动，得到了成田市居民的有力支持。他们强烈谴责佐藤反动政府的法西斯暴行，并且向警察投掷石头，同农民和学生并肩战斗。
    这场激烈的斗争从下午两点起一直持续到傍晚。有一百多名农民和学生受伤，有二十二名爱国者被非法逮捕。
    户村一作就这场斗争发表谈话说：佐藤政府出动大批武装警察镇压我们，我们绝不屈服。越南人民面对着拥有现代化武器的美帝国主义，由于坚持了人民战争，不断地取得了伟大胜利。日本人民的反美爱国斗争正在走向高潮，只要我们斗争下去，最后的胜利一定是属于日本人民的。
    新华社二十八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本青年、学生、工人、市民一千二百人，二十七日晚上在东京举行大会，强烈反对驻日美军当局在东京新设野战医院。
    大会揭露和谴责了美帝国主义侵略越南的罪行，热烈欢呼越南南方军民的新春大捷。
    反对美军扩建基地的日本农民，胸前戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章参加了大会。农民代表在会上讲话说，日本人民绝对不允许佐藤政府把日本献给美帝国主义，充当侵略越南和亚洲的基地。
    参加大会的群众在会后进行了示威游行。当示威队伍走向东京王子美军兵营时，遭到了一千五百名日本警察的野蛮镇压。他们对示威者拳打脚踢，并当场非法逮捕了三名爱国青年。
    警察的法西斯暴行，激起了许多市民的愤慨。他们对着警察高呼：“美国洋奴滚蛋！”“卖国贼可耻！”这时，示威队伍和市民汇拢起来，口号声连成一片，使佐藤政府派出的武装警察完全处在群众的包围之中，极为狼狈。（附图片）
