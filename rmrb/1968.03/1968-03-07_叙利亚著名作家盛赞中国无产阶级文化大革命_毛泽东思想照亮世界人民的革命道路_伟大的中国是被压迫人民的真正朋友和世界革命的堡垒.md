	Syrian renowned writer Zadat Rikaibi recently told Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Damascus that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is guided by Mao Zedong Thought, is "a great event of historic significance in contemporary times."

	Rikaibi recently visited China. He said: "During my visit to China, I came into contact with people from all walks of life, including workers, peasants, writers, and revolutionary intellectuals. I can confidently say that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, has deeply penetrated people's hearts and achieved decisive victories."

	He said this victory "shattered the slanders of the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries of various countries who were trembling with fear."

	Rikaibi said that the Chinese people have an immense love for Chairman Mao, and Mao Zedong Thought has been vividly and concretely applied. Chairman Mao's great call to "Criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeoisie" has been carried out. He emphasized: "The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. They will win the final victory."

	Rikaibi said that Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the revolutionary path for the people of all countries. "To eliminate imperialism and the system of exploitation, one must deeply study the works of Chairman Mao Zedong." He pointed out: "The Arab people must, in their struggle against imperialism and Zionism, seek guidance and enlightenment from Mao Zedong Thought."

	Rikaibi said: The love of the Chinese people for the Syrian people, who firmly stand on the side of opposing U.S. imperialism and its puppet Israel, deeply moved me. The Chinese people resolutely and thoroughly support the struggle of the Arab people against imperialists and aggressors, which is a concrete manifestation of internationalism.

	He said: "The Syrian Arab people have great love for Chairman Mao and the great Chinese people. After we gain more experience and lessons from our struggles, the friendship between our two peoples will surely grow stronger."

	Rikaibi finally pointed out: China is the true friend of the oppressed people. China is the pillar for the people of the world to achieve the final decisive victory in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The great China with a population of 700 million is the fortress of the world revolution.

    新华社大马士革电　叙利亚著名作家扎达特·里卡比不久前在这里对新华社记者说，以毛泽东思想作为指导思想的中国无产阶级文化大革命，“是当代具有历史意义的伟大事件”。
    里卡比不久前访问了中国。他说：“在我访问中国期间，我接触了各阶层的友好的中国人民，其中有工人、农民、作家和革命的知识分子。我可以肯定地说，由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命已经深入人心，并取得了决定性的胜利。”
    他说，这一胜利“粉碎了吓得胆战心惊的美帝国主义和各国反动派的种种诽谤”。
    里卡比说，中国人民对毛主席无比热爱，毛泽东思想得到了生动的具体的运用。毛主席的“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召得到了贯彻。他强调指出：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民是不可战胜的。他们将赢得最后的胜利。”
    里卡比说，毛泽东思想照亮了世界各国人民的革命道路，“为了消灭帝国主义和剥削制度，要深入学习毛泽东主席的著作。”他指出：“阿拉伯人民必须在反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争中，向毛泽东思想求教并得到启示。”
    里卡比说：中国人民对坚定地站在反对美帝国主义及其傀儡以色列的立场上的叙利亚人民的热爱，使我很受感动。中国人民坚决、彻底地支持阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义者和侵略者的斗争，这是国际主义精神的具体表现。
    他说：“阿拉伯叙利亚人民对毛主席和伟大的中国人民怀着极大的热爱。当我们在斗争中得到新的教训和得到更多的经验之后，我们两国人民的友谊必将越来越增长。”
    里卡比最后指出：中国是被压迫人民的真正朋友。中国是世界人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中赢得最后的决定性胜利的支柱。拥有七亿人口的伟大中国是世界革命的堡垒。
