The certain unit of the Engineering Corps of the People's Liberation Army is a model company that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unshakably follow the path of promoting proletarian politics, and engage in a head-on struggle against the bourgeois military line advocated by the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. They bravely defend the great leader Chairman Mao's military thought and military line.

This company, with Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, has been working in the mountains, living in shacks, enduring hardships, and toiling for years to safeguard Chairman Mao's construction work. They have overcome mountains and opened roads.

This company has been rated as a "Four Good" company for seven consecutive years and has been honored to receive the great leader Chairman Mao's reception twice.

Firmly Walking the Bright Path Indicated by Chairman Mao

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military lines are not produced and developed naturally and peacefully, but are produced and developed through struggle."

The struggle between the two lines in our army is one of promoting politics and the other of promoting military affairs. This is a serious class struggle.

This struggle is also reflected in the construction of the Engineering Corps. The question of what kind of Engineering Corps to build and how to build it is at the core of the struggle between the two lines. Is it to persist in the path of promoting proletarian politics, to build the army according to Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, and to cultivate revolutionary soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and have a high level of communist consciousness? Or is it to follow the path of promoting military affairs and technology, to build the army according to the bourgeois military line, and to cultivate "confused soldiers" who only know how to drill and blast, eat and sleep, and are full of individualism? This is the core and focus of the struggle between the two lines.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing attempted to use the bourgeois military line to transform the Engineering Corps. Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing visited the unit where the company is located multiple times, spreading poison and advocating reactionary slogans such as "construction is the key," "construction is supreme," and "everything gives way to construction." They shouted that "whether the cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat," attempting to lead the construction of the Engineering Corps astray.

At this critical moment, our beloved Vice Chairman Lin Biao inspected the unit and gave extremely important instructions to strengthen the political and ideological work of the company to safeguard Chairman Mao's construction work. Soon, the resolution of the 1960 enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, chaired by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, was transmitted to the unit where the company is located. The instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao and the resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission inherited and carried forward the traditions of the Gutian Conference, like a beacon, illuminating the path of our army's victory and pointing out the direction for the construction of the Engineering Corps.

During the study of the resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, the soldiers of the company reviewed the path they had walked: whenever they put proletarian politics in the first place in the construction of the company, the company thrived; whenever they neglected politics for technology, all work went astray. Personal experiences and vivid contrasts made the broad masses of cadres and soldiers deeply realize that leading with Mao Zedong Thought and promoting the ideological revolution of people is the foundation of the company's construction. They must unshakably follow the bright path of promoting proletarian politics indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao.

Through study, the cadres of the company raised their awareness of the "Four Firsts" and focused on the ideological revolution of people. Before construction, they used Mao Zedong Thought for political mobilization; during construction, they used Chairman Mao's quotations to inspire soldiers to overcome difficulties; after construction, they used Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" as the standard for evaluation. The company established on-site political propaganda and mobilization personnel to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, commend good deeds, and carry out political work on-site and in the hearts of every individual.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A correct understanding often needs to go through multiple repetitions from matter to spirit, from spirit to matter, that is, from practice to cognition, from cognition to practice, to be completed." The company, in practice, continuously summed up experiences and continuously raised the awareness of promoting proletarian politics.

Once, the company participated in a major engineering battle. The construction task was heavy, the time was tight, the manpower was insufficient, and the technical conditions were poor. Under these circumstances, some people thought that while they could insist on the "Four Firsts" in normal times, now that the task was so heavy, they should focus on construction. Some people proposed canceling on-site propaganda work temporarily to add more labor force to construction. The party branch seized this active thought and immediately organized everyone to review the Gutian Conference resolution and the 1960 resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission. After the study, everyone unanimously agreed that political work is the foundation of our army's construction, and Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our army's construction. The heavier the task, the tighter the time, and the greater the difficulty, the more we should insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, and the more we should insist on the "Four Firsts." Because they insisted on the "Four Firsts" and strengthened on-site propaganda and mobilization work, they promoted the ideological revolution of the company. The great spiritual power of Mao Zedong Thought was transformed into tremendous material power, and as a result, they completed the construction task ahead of schedule. The soldiers of the company won another great victory in the struggle to promote proletarian politics.

The Engineering Corps is a technical corps. What should be relied on to build the army? The soldiers of the company firmly answered: the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! The company moved to a new construction site and was assigned the task of building a chimney. This type of work had never been done by the company before. What should they do? The party branch of the company first led the entire company to treat the construction site as a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to study and apply the "Three Articles" extensively, and then handed over the task to the masses for discussion, held "Zhuge Liang meetings," and mobilized everyone to think of solutions and offer suggestions. Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "When the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they become the smartest and bravest, and can exert boundless power!" The company used politics to lead construction and technology, "learning war from war," and finally overcame numerous technical difficulties, broke through one technical barrier after another, and excellently completed the task assigned by the party. They used ironclad facts to thoroughly smash the reactionary fallacies of "technology first" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing.

Bravely Defending Chairman Mao's Military Line

In 1964, when the company was advancing victoriously along the bright path of promoting proletarian politics under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, in order to achieve his evil goal of usurping the military and opposing the party, stirred up the evil wind of large-scale military exercises. Chairman Mao said: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no room for compromise on the line issue." At this critical moment of the great struggle between the two military lines, the heroic company stood up and bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. When the evil wind of large-scale military exercises blew, the soldiers of the company keenly sensed that there was a problem. After watching the "expert performances," the soldiers said: "Large-scale military exercises, isn't this playing tricks?" "If this continues, the army will become a circus!" "Can a few 'experts' fight a war?" At this time, the party branch organized everyone to study the Gutian Conference resolution and the 1960 resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, and reviewed the facts of resolutely responding to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's great call for the "Four Firsts" since 1961 and advancing victoriously along Chairman Mao's military line. Everyone firmly stated: Among all the principles, the first is to listen to Chairman Mao's words. Large-scale military exercises do not conform to Chairman Mao's military thought and military line. No matter who instructed it, we will not engage in it. From then on, a head-on struggle began.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing wanted to compete for military supremacy and engage in large-scale military exercises; the soldiers of the company competed for political supremacy and launched a "great study" of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They firmly said: We compete for the first place in promoting Mao Zedong Thought, the first place in promoting proletarian politics, and the first place in implementing the "Four Firsts" proposed by Vice Chairman Lin. Other first places are not important. The party branch also made special regulations: When arranging work, first arrange the study of Chairman Mao's works; when inspecting work, first inspect the situation of studying Chairman Mao's works; when reporting work, first report the situation of studying Chairman Mao's works; when summarizing work, first summarize the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing required various units to study how to conduct large-scale military exercises and to "implement them quickly." The soldiers of the company did not listen to this and took the opposite approach, finding the weak links in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, seriously summarizing the experience of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, studying how to better carry out the mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and insisting on the "Four Firsts." The party branch decided not to form an elite class but to establish an active model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the platoon and company.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing advocated visiting large-scale military exercises, and the party branch of the company organized the entire company to visit the advanced examples of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works by comrades Liao Chujian, Feng Fugeng, and Huang Zushi, as well as some advanced examples of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the locality, and set up an exhibition of advanced experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the company.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing wanted to summarize and exchange the experience of large-scale military exercises. The party branch of the company organized the entire company to extensively study and apply the "Three Articles," hold a study and application meeting of Chairman Mao's works every week, summarize and promote the advanced experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works within the unit and in other units.

Promoting politics leads to the promotion of everything. Building the company with Mao Zedong Thought will have the greatest combat effectiveness. That year, the company unshakably followed the path of promoting proletarian politics, focused on the fundamentals, insisted on building the company with Mao Zedong Thought, strengthened ideological and political work, implemented the "Four Firsts," and launched an unprecedented mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They not only had firm political and ideological standards but also had firm military training, construction, and production. They not only completed the construction task in excess but also achieved excellence in military training. Through the resolute struggle against the bourgeois military line, the red flag of the "Four Good" company of the company was not only not lowered but was held even higher. At the end of 1964, our beloved Vice Chairman Lin Biao issued instructions to the entire army to promote politics, exposing Luo Ruiqing's evil conspiracy. However, Luo Ruiqing, this counter-revolutionary revisionist element, did not give up and continued to play the role of a counter-revolutionary two-faced trickster, spreading the fallacy of opportunism. He personally went to the unit and spread poison, saying: "Are you not promoting politics now? Completing this project is the greatest promotion of politics."

The great leader Chairman Mao warned us: "Those who do not believe in promoting politics and express it as paying lip service while secretly spreading a set of opportunism (i.e., revisionism) should be alerted by everyone." The soldiers of the company, through the practice of struggle, had gradually mastered the experience of struggling against various bourgeois military lines. They did not fall for Luo Ruiqing's trick. The party branch, in order to resist and eliminate the fallacy of opportunism spread by Luo Ruiqing, organized the entire company to hold a great debate on "How to promote politics and insist on the 'Four Firsts'." Everyone talked about and exposed the benefits of promoting proletarian politics and insisting on the "Four Firsts," and the harms of military first and construction first. Through the debate, the soldiers of the company further raised their understanding of promoting proletarian politics and strengthened their awareness of insisting on the "Four Firsts." Even in the face of tight time, heavy construction tasks, and poor conditions, they insisted on political education and party and league activities without hesitation. "Daily Reading" was unshakable. Studying Chairman Mao's works was not affected by tight time or heavy tasks, and they insisted on the fundamentals without wavering.

They braved the adverse winds and waves, always holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and unshakably followed the bright path of promoting proletarian politics.

Forever Loyal to the Great Leader Chairman Mao

On August 17 and October 10, 1965, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao received the company twice.

After being received by Chairman Mao, the soldiers of the company raised the construction of the company to a new and higher level. They led with Mao Zedong Thought, promoted the ideological revolution of people; they took forever loyalty to Chairman Mao, forever loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the foundation of the company's construction. They often carried out mass self-education activities of "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao," with everyone loving Chairman Mao and following Chairman Mao closely. They raised the promotion of proletarian politics to the height of loyalty to Chairman Mao, and more consciously and firmly followed the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

In recent years, the company has moved from one construction site to another, with tasks, environments, and personnel constantly changing. However, the soldiers' red hearts of loyalty to Chairman Mao never changed, and their path of promoting proletarian politics never changed. The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought was held higher and higher in the company.

In 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao personally ignited the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world. The company's garrison was surrounded by big-character posters and leaflets, and revolutionary masses continuously debated and marched around the garrison from morning to night. At this critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the company also faced a severe test.

Once, the local party capitalist-roaders called the company, attempting to incite the company to suppress the proletarian revolutionary faction. The company's political instructor Zhang Tangyin firmly refuted on the phone: "We are soldiers loyal to Chairman Mao. Without the order of the proletarian headquarters, no one can mobilize our company." This gave the class enemy a blow to the head.

This party capitalist-roader, failing in one plot, played another trick, inciting some deceived masses to the company, stirring up the soldiers, and attempting to disrupt the army. The soldiers patiently read to the deceived masses the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao regarding the army's participation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and firmly said: "We do what Chairman Mao says." The company firmly resisted the black wind of the party capitalist-roaders and firmly supported the revolutionary actions of the proletarian revolutionary faction. Revolutionary masses said: The soldiers of the company are clear-eyed and steadfast, completely standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction, unshakable by strong winds, and unmovable by surging waves.

To safeguard Chairman Mao, safeguard Mao Zedong Thought, and safeguard Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the soldiers of the company joined the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. They fearlessly and tirelessly turned the construction site into a battlefield, working during the day and holding denunciation and criticism meetings at night, writing articles, and putting up wall newspapers, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. The soldier Mao Qingfan, who had never been to school, usually had others write letters for him. With his boundless love for Chairman Mao and his deep hatred for the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, he asked others to teach him letter by letter, spending seven consecutive nights writing a criticism article of several thousand words. The entire company of cadres and soldiers were boiling with blood and burning with anger, writing nearly five thousand criticism articles.

In July 1967, the company was assigned the glorious task of building a giant statue of Chairman Mao. They, with their loyal hearts to Chairman Mao, overcame one difficulty after another, and after fifty-nine days of hard work, built a magnificent statue of Chairman Mao.

On the day they left the construction site, the soldiers of the company, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," lined up in front of the statue of Chairman Mao and solemnly swore: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you received us twice, which is the greatest concern for us, forever inspiring us to advance along the bright path you indicated. We will forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and forever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line. We dare to brave the sword mountain and fire sea, and our resolve will not be shaken even if the sky falls and the earth collapses."

The company, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will forever advance along the victorious path indicated by Chairman Mao!

    勇敢捍卫伟大统帅毛主席的建军路线
    坚定不移走突出无产阶级政治的道路
    ——记中国人民解放军工程兵第二届学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会先进集体某部一连
    人民解放军工程兵某部一连，是一个无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的模范连队。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，针锋相对地同中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级军事路线作斗争，勇敢地捍卫了伟大统帅毛主席的建军思想和建军路线。
    这个连队，用毛泽东思想挂帅，长年累月，钻山沟，住窝棚，吃大苦，耐大劳，为保卫毛主席施工，劈山山倒，开路路通。
    这个连队，连续七年被评为四好连队，两次光荣地受到伟大统帅毛主席的接见。
    坚定地走毛主席指引的光明大道
    毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”
    我军两条路线的斗争，一条是突出政治，一条是突出军事。这是一场严重的阶级斗争。
    这场斗争也反映在工程兵部队的建设上。建设一支什么样的工程兵，靠什么建设工程兵？是坚持走突出无产阶级政治的道路，按照毛主席的无产阶级建军路线建设部队，培养无限忠于毛主席、具有高度共产主义觉悟的革命战士，还是走突出军事、突出技术的道路，按照资产阶级军事路线建设部队，培养只会打眼放炮、吃饭睡觉，满脑子个人主义的“糊涂兵”？这是两条路线斗争的核心，斗争的焦点。
    反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，妄想用资产阶级建军路线来改造工程兵部队。彭德怀、罗瑞卿先后多次来到一连所在的部队放毒，提出“以施工为纲”、“施工高于一切”、“一切为施工让路”等反动口号，叫嚷什么“不管白猫黑猫，抓住老鼠就是好猫”，企图把工程兵部队的建设引向邪路。
    就在这个关键时刻，我们敬爱的副统帅林彪同志视察了这个部队，对部队作了极为重要的指示，要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，加强连队的政治思想工作，为保卫毛主席施工。不久，林彪副主席亲自主持制定的一九六○年军委扩大会议决议传到了一连所在的部队。林彪副主席的指示和军委扩大会议决议，继承和发扬了古田会议的传统，象一盏光芒四射的红灯，照亮了我军胜利前进的道路，指明了工程兵部队建设的方向。
    在学习军委扩大会议决议过程中，一连指战员们回顾了连队走过的道路：什么时候把突出无产阶级政治摆在连队建设的第一位，连队就蓬蓬勃勃；什么时候突出技术丢掉了政治，各项工作就走上歪路。切身的经历，鲜明的对比，使广大干部战士深刻地认识到，用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，是连队建设的根本，一定要坚定不移地走伟大统帅毛主席指引的突出无产阶级政治的光明大道。
    通过学习，连队干部坚持四个第一的自觉性提高了，他们狠抓人的思想革命化。施工前，用毛泽东思想进行政治动员，施工中，用毛主席语录鼓动战士战胜困难；施工后，以毛主席的“老三篇”为标准进行讲评。连队设立了现场政治宣传鼓动员，宣传毛泽东思想，表扬好人好事，连队政治工作做到现场，做到每个人的心坎上。
    毛主席教导说：“一个正确的认识，往往需要经过由物质到精神，由精神到物质，即由实践到认识，由认识到实践这样多次的反复，才能够完成。”一连在实践中，不断总结经验，不断提高突出无产阶级政治的自觉性。
    一次，一连参加某项工程大会战。施工任务很重，时间要求很紧，人力不够，技术条件差。在这种情况下，有人认为，平时可以坚持四个第一，现在任务这么重，应该突出一下施工了。有人提出，现场宣传工作可以暂时取消，这样可以多几个劳动力投入施工。党支部抓住这种活思想，立即组织大家重温了古田会议决议和一九六○年军委扩大会议决议。经过学习，大家一致认为，政治工作是我军建设的根本，毛泽东思想是我军建设的灵魂，任务越重，时间越紧，困难越大，越是要坚持活学活用毛主席著作，越是要坚持四个第一。由于坚持了四个第一，加强了现场宣传鼓动工作，促进了连队的思想革命化，毛泽东思想的伟大精神力量转化成了巨大的物质力量，结果，提前完成了施工任务。一连指战员在突出无产阶级政治的斗争中，又打了一个大胜仗。
    工程兵是一个技术兵种。建设部队靠什么？一连指战员们坚定地回答：靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想！一连转到一个新的工地，担任烟囱施工的任务。这种工作，一连从来没有干过。怎么办？一连党支部首先领导全连把工地当成活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，大学大用“老三篇”，然后把任务交给群众讨论，开“诸葛亮会”，发动大家想办法，出主意。林副主席说：“人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量！”一连用政治统帅施工，用政治统帅技术，“从战争学习战争”，终于克服重重困难，攻破了一个个技术难关，出色地完成了党交给他们的任务。他们用铁一般的事实，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿鼓吹的“技术第一”的反动谬论。
      英勇地捍卫毛主席的建军路线
    一九六四年，正当一连高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席指引的突出无产阶级政治的光明大道胜利前进时，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，为了达到他篡军反党的罪恶目的，刮起了大比武的妖风。毛主席说：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”英雄的一连在两条建军路线大搏斗的关键时刻，挺身而出，英勇地捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。当大比武的妖风刮来时，一连的同志们就敏锐地察觉到这中间有问题。战士们看了“尖子表演”后说：“大比武，这不是玩戏法吗！”“这样下去，军队不就成了马戏团啦！”“光靠几个‘尖子’能打仗吗？”这时党支部组织大家学习古田会议决议和一九六○年军委扩大会议决议，回顾了一九六一年以来坚决响应林彪副主席提出的四个第一的伟大号召，沿着毛主席的建军路线大踏步胜利前进的事实。大家坚定地表示：千条万条，听毛主席的话是第一条。大比武不符合毛主席的建军思想和军事路线，不管他是谁指示的，就是不搞。从此，一场针锋相对的斗争开始了。
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿要争军事第一，搞大比武；一连的同志们就争政治第一，开展活学活用毛主席著作的“大比学”。他们坚定地说：争，我们要争突出毛泽东思想的第一，争突出无产阶级政治的第一，争贯彻林副主席提出的四个第一的第一，其他第一不要。党支部还作了专门规定：布置工作，首先布置学习毛主席著作；检查工作，首先检查学习毛主席著作的情况；汇报工作，首先汇报学习毛主席著作的情况；总结工作，首先总结活学活用毛主席著作的经验。
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿要求各单位研究如何搞好大比武，要“赶紧落实”。一连的同志不听这一套，就来了个反其道而行之，狠找活学活用毛主席著作方面的薄弱环节，认真总结活学活用毛主席著作的经验，研究如何更好地开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，坚持四个第一。党支部决定不凑尖子班，而在班排连树立了活学活用毛主席著作的活样板。
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿鼓吹参观大比武，一连党支部就组织全连的同志参观廖初江、丰福生、黄祖示同志活学活用毛主席著作先进事迹和地方上一些活学活用毛主席著作先进事迹的展览，并且在连队里办起了活学活用毛主席著作先进经验的展览。
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿要总结、交流大比武的经验。一连党支部就组织全连同志大学大用“老三篇”，每周开一次活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，总结、推广本单位和外单位活学活用毛主席著作的先进经验。
    突出政治，一通百通。用毛泽东思想建设连队就会有最大的战斗力。这一年，一连坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的路，大抓了根本，坚持用毛泽东思想建设连队，思想政治工作更加加强了，四个第一更加落实了，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了一个空前未有的新局面。他们不仅政治思想过得硬，军事训练、施工、生产也过得硬，不但超额完成了施工任务，军事训练也达到优秀。经过同资产阶级军事路线的坚决斗争，一连四好连队的红旗不但没有倒下去，反而比过去举得更高了。
    一九六四年底，我们敬爱的林副主席向全军发出了突出政治的指示，揭穿了罗瑞卿的罪恶阴谋。但是，罗瑞卿这个反革命修正主义分子贼心不死，继续玩弄反革命两面派手段，大放折中主义的谬论。他亲自出马，跑到这个部队放毒说：“你们现在不是要突出政治吗？完成这个工程就是最大的突出政治。”
    伟大领袖毛主席告诫我们说：“那些不相信突出政治，对于突出政治表示阳奉阴违，而自己另外散布一套折中主义（即机会主义）的人们，大家应当有所警惕。”一连的同志们通过斗争的实践已逐步掌握了和形形色色的资产阶级军事路线作斗争的经验，他们没有上罗瑞卿的当。党支部为了抵制和肃清罗瑞卿散布的折中主义谬论，组织全连展开了一个“怎样突出政治，坚持四个第一”的大辩论。大家大谈大摆突出无产阶级政治、坚持四个第一的好处，大诉大批军事第一、工程第一的危害。通过辩论，一连的同志们更进一步提高了对突出无产阶级政治的认识，增强了坚持四个第一的自觉性，在时间紧、施工任务重，条件差的情况下，仍毫不犹豫地坚持政治教育和党团活动，“天天读”雷打不动。学习毛主席著作做到了时间紧挤不倒，任务重压不倒，坚持根本不转向。
    他们顶逆风，战恶浪，始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地走在突出无产阶级政治的光明大道上。
        永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席
    一九六五年八月十七日和十月十日，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席两次接见了一连。
    在毛主席接见以后，一连指战员把连队建设提高到一个更新的阶段，更高的水平。他们以毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化；以永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，作为连队建设的根本。他们经常开展“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”的群众性自我教育活动，人人热爱毛主席，个个紧跟毛主席。他们把突出无产阶级政治，提到忠于毛主席的高度，更加自觉，更加坚定地走毛主席指引的路。
    几年来，一连从一个工地转到另一个工地，任务、环境、人员不断变化。但是，指战员们忠于毛主席的红心永不变，走突出无产阶级政治的路永不变。毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在一连越举越高。
    一九六六年，我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃了震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火。一连驻地附近到处贴满了大字报、传单，从早到晚，革命群众接连不断地在驻地附近辩论、游行。在这个两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，一连也面临着严峻的考验。
    有一次，驻地党内走资派打电话给一连，妄图挑动一连去镇压无产阶级革命派。一连指导员张堂印在电话中坚定地驳斥说：“我们是忠于毛主席的战士，没有无产阶级司令部的命令，谁也休想调动我们连队。”给了阶级敌人当头一棒。
    这个党内走资派一个阴谋没有得逞，又耍出第二个阴谋，煽动一些受蒙蔽的群众到一连，挑动战士，妄图把部队搞乱。战士们向受蒙蔽的群众耐心地宣读了毛主席和以毛主席为首的党中央有关对部队参加无产阶级文化大革命的指示，坚定地说：“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。”一连对党内走资派的黑风坚决顶住，对无产阶级革命派的革命行动坚决支持。革命群众说：一连同志们心明眼亮立场稳，完全站在无产阶级革命派一边，狂风吹不动，恶浪打不倒。
    为了保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一连指战员投入了对党内最大的一小撮走资派的斗争。他们不怕疲劳，不怕困难，把工地变成战场，白天施工，夜晚召开声讨会、批判会，写文章，出墙报，以毛泽东思想作武器，狠狠批判中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿。战士毛庆芳没有读过书，平时写信都是请别人代写。他怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，怀着对党内最大的一小撮走资派的无比仇恨，请别人一字字教他，整整花了七个夜晚，写出几千字的批判文章。全连干部、战士热血沸腾，怒火燃烧，写出了四千九百多篇批判稿。
    一九六七年七月，一连接受了建造毛主席巨型塑像的光荣任务。他们怀着对毛主席的赤胆忠心，克服一个又一个困难，经过五十九天奋战，把一座雄伟的毛主席塑像建造了起来。
    在离开工地那天，一连指战员手捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，列队在毛主席塑像前，齐声宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席，您两次接见我们，是对我们最大的关怀，永远鼓舞着我们沿着您指引的光明大道前进。我们永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线，刀山火海也敢闯，天塌地陷志不移。”
    一连高举着毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席指引的胜利大道，永远向前！
