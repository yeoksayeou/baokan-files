Japanese Youth in Yamaguchi Prefecture Rise Up to Protest
Tokyo Patriotic Youth Hold Another Rally to Protest U.S. Military's Construction of New Field Hospital for Vietnam

BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the East Asia News Agency: About 300 youths, students, farmers, and women from Yamaguchi Prefecture held a rally in Hōfu City on March 3 to oppose the Sato government's revival of Japanese militarism and to support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against American imperialism.

Speaking at the rally, youth representative KUBO Teruo pointed out that revolutionary waves are surging in every corner of the world. In various parts of Japan, the flames of resistance against the war policies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are burning brightly. The Japanese people must unite and, undaunted by sacrifices, fight to the end for the liberation of their motherland.

ANMURA Tetsuji, a standing committee member of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left Wing), and SUZUKI Atsuo, secretary-general of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Headquarters of the Japanese Socialist Party, both spoke at the rally, expressing their determination to join the youth and farmers in the struggle against militarism and American imperialism.

After the rally, the participants marched to the gates of the "Self-Defense Forces" base and the police station in Hōfu City, shouting slogans such as "Oppose the revival of militarism!" and "U.S. troops out of Japan!" The protesters received widespread support from the local residents.

The Japanese reactionary authorities dispatched 250 armed police to suppress the protesters' march and illegally arrested five young workers. The protesters bravely fought back against the police.

BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the East Asia News Agency: About 1,000 patriotic youths and students in Tokyo held another rally on March 3 to protest the construction of a new field hospital by the U.S. military in Tokyo. After the rally, they marched to the U.S. military barracks in Tokyo's Ōji District to hold a protest demonstration.

As soon as the march began, heavily armed Japanese police brutally suppressed the protesters with bayonets and clubs. The youths and students, undeterred by the violence, bravely fought back against the armed police. The police illegally arrested 49 students.

On the same day, inspired by the students' brave struggle, about 150 residents and housewives living near the U.S. military barracks in Ōji District also held a rally to oppose the construction of the new field hospital and marched to the barracks to hold a protest demonstration.

Due to the increasing number of wounded U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam, the U.S. military, with the assistance of the Sato government, is hurriedly constructing a new field hospital in Tokyo.

Recently, patriotic youths and students, as well as the broad masses of Tokyo residents, have continuously held protest demonstrations at the U.S. military barracks to oppose the reactionary actions of American imperialism.
