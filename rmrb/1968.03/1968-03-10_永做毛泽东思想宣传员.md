The East is red, the sun is rising. The greatest leader of the revolutionary people of the whole world, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, received us. Happiness and excitement make it difficult for us to express our boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao with words.

Dear Chairman Mao! Rain nourishes the seedlings. It is your brilliant ideas that have made us, two children of poor peasants, follow the revolutionary army led by you from a young age and embark on the revolutionary journey. It is your brilliant ideas that have made us grow continuously in the revolutionary struggle.

Dear Chairman Mao! When the sky is filled with dark clouds, your brilliant ideas are a great beacon, guiding us forward. When the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the party, in collusion with Soviet revisionists, peddled revisionist fallacies, you wisely taught us that philosophy must serve proletarian politics. You called on us to take philosophy out of the study and out of the classroom. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which you personally initiated and led, exposed the conspiracy of the biggest clique of capitalist roaders and counter-revolutionary revisionists within the party to oppose and distort your great thoughts and prevent us from studying and applying your great works. We must follow your teachings, use philosophy as a sharp weapon for the proletariat to fight against the bourgeoisie, and make the study and propagation of your great philosophical ideas our lifelong mission.

Dear Chairman Mao! We deeply realize that in this new era when the world enters under the great banner of your brilliant ideas, it is a great honor and responsibility to be propagandists of your great thoughts!

To study your brilliant ideas, we resolutely respond to your great call: go to the masses, learn from the masses, and be humble students of the masses. We must, in the great waves of mass movements, persist in criticizing and repudiating revisionism, constantly reform and temper ourselves.

Dear Chairman Mao! We pledge to you: forever loyal to you, forever loyal to your great thoughts, forever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line, forever be propagandists of your great thoughts.

    永做毛泽东思想宣传员
    政治学院学习毛主席著作积极分子于乃昌　武涛
    东方红，太阳升。全世界革命人民最伟大的领袖，我们心中的红太阳毛主席接见了我们。幸福和激动，使我们难以用语言表达对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱无限忠诚的心情。
    敬爱的毛主席啊，毛主席！雨露滋润禾苗长。是您的光辉思想，使我们这两个贫农的孩子，从小就跟随您率领的革命大军，踏上了革命的征程。是您的光辉思想，使我们在革命斗争中不断成长。
    敬爱的毛主席！在天空乌云弥漫的时候，您的光辉思想，是一盏伟大的明灯，给我们指引了前进的方向。当党内最大的一小撮走资派同苏修内外呼应，大肆贩卖修正主义谬论的时候，您英明地教导我们，哲学要为无产阶级政治服务。您号召我们，哲学要走出书斋，哲学要走出课堂。您亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，揭穿了党内最大的一小撮走资派和反革命修正主义分子反对和歪曲您的伟大思想、不准我们活学活用您的伟大著作的阴谋。我们一定要遵照您的教导，把哲学当成无产阶级对资产阶级进行斗争的锐利武器，把学习和宣传您的伟大哲学思想，当作毕生的战斗任务。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们深深地认识到：在全世界进入以您的光辉思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，作为您的伟大思想的宣传员，责任是多么光荣和重大！
    为了学习您的光辉思想，我们坚决响应您的伟大号召：到群众中去，向群众学习，甘当群众的小学生。我们一定要在群众运动的大风大浪中，坚持斗私批修，不断改造自己，锻炼自己。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们向您宣誓：永远忠于您，永远忠于您的伟大思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线，永远做您的伟大思想的宣传员。
