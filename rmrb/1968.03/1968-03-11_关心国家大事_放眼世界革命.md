	Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must concern yourselves with national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We women of Dazhai have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, been pioneers in revolution, vanguards in fighting selfishness, and models in production, achieving great victories in 1967.

	China's Khrushchov opposes women studying Chairman Mao's works, opposes women participating in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. He forbade the All-China Women's Federation from printing Chairman Mao's sayings on the women's movement, actually stating in his "instructions" that "we should use less authority and more free discussion and debate among comrades." His accomplice, Lu Dingyi, also "instructed" the All-China Women's Federation, saying, "Do not use the study of Chairman Mao's works as a criterion for evaluation." This is extremely reactionary! They do not want us to study Chairman Mao's works, so what do they want us to study? China's Khrushchov wants women to study only "technology" and "culture," to ensure "family prosperity." China's Khrushchov wants to strip us women of our revolutionary spirit, bind us within the small family circle, and make us the social base for his restoration of capitalism. This counter-revolutionary plot must be thoroughly exposed.

	We poor and lower-middle peasant women suffered immense exploitation and oppression from landlords and rich peasants in the old society. We hate the exploiting classes and the exploiting system to the core. It is Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that liberated us from suffering. Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's words are the truth, speaking directly to our hearts.

	We women of Dazhai listen most to Chairman Mao and are most loyal to Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought has given us boundless strength, and the red sun has illuminated our path forward in Dazhai. Over the years, we women, just like the male members, have made contributions in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. Every piece of land in Dazhai, every farming task, and every construction project all bear the sweat and blood of our women.

	Standing on Hu Tou Mountain, looking towards Tiananmen, our hearts embrace the world. After last year's wheat harvest, we women proactively suggested to the branch that wheat should be stored well, can be made into biscuits and bread, and we should sell more to the state, eating more coarse grains ourselves. To support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, we are willing to endure some hardship ourselves. If we ourselves are liberated and live a happy life, but forget our class brothers and sisters who suffered, then we are not true revolutionaries, but false revolutionaries.

	We women of Dazhai must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively organize and participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, thoroughly carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, raise the level of women's ideological revolution to a new height, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 关心国家大事　放眼世界革命

　　关心国家大事　放眼世界革命
　　大寨大队党支部副书记　妇代会主任　宋立英
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们大寨妇女，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，革命当闯将，斗私当先锋，生产当模范，在一九六七年取得了伟大胜利。
    中国赫鲁晓夫反对妇女学习毛主席著作，反对妇女参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设。他不准全国妇联印发毛主席关于妇女运动的语录，竟在“批示”中胡说什么：“少用一些权威，多在同志中进行自由的讨论和辩论。”他的死党陆定一还对全国妇联“指示”说：“不要把学习毛主席著作作为评比条件。”真是反动透顶！他们不让我们学习毛主席著作，要我们学什么呢？中国赫鲁晓夫只要妇女学习
  “技术”，学习“文化”，搞“家庭的丰衣足食”。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想抽掉我们妇女的革命灵魂，把我们妇女束缚在小家庭的圈子里，成为他复辟资本主义的社会基础。这个反革命阴谋，必须彻底戳穿。
    我们贫下中农妇女，在旧社会受尽地主、富农的剥削和压迫，我们恨透了剥削阶级和剥削制度。是毛主席和共产党把我们从苦水里解放出来。爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。毛主席的话是真理，句句说到我们心坎上。
    我们大寨妇女最听毛主席话，最忠于毛主席。毛泽东思想给了我们无穷无尽的力量，红太阳照亮了我们大寨前进的道路。多年来，我们妇女和男社员一样，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，做出了贡献。大寨的每一块土地，每一种农活，每一项建设工程，都有我们妇女的血汗。
    我们站在虎头山，眼望天安门，胸怀全世界。去年小麦丰收后，我们妇女主动向支部建议，小麦好储备，能做饼干、面包，要多卖一些给国家，自己多吃点粗粮。为了支援世界人民的革命斗争，我们宁愿自己艰苦一些。如果自己解放了，过上了幸福生活，就忘记了受苦受难的阶级兄弟姐妹，那就不是真革命，而是假革命。
    我们大寨妇女一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极举办和参加毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把妇女的思想革命化提高到一个新水平，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
