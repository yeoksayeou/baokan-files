	Rational Rules and Regulations Must Be Enforced
	Material Clerk of the Chemical Plant, Dong Huapu

	I am a material clerk. I have come to realize that resisting the anarchist trend is everyone's responsibility. As someone who guards the gate to state property, I must not be extravagant with state assets or engage in activities that harm revolutionary interests.

	When I strictly control the issuance of materials, some people criticize me, saying that I use regulations to "block" people. They also criticize me for "not breaking old frameworks" and "lacking revolutionary spirit"!

	Hearing these criticisms, my mind was in turmoil. I thought, are the regulations unreasonable? Do they hinder production by being outdated? No, they are not! In fact, for the issuance of items like gloves, masks, and work clothes, they are exchanged for new ones on schedule; for materials needed for engineering, they are allocated based on actual engineering needs. What is wrong with that?

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy, must be in the interests of the people,..." It is completely right to abolish unreasonable rules and regulations, but to indiscriminately discard good experiences and methods accumulated from long-term production practice is not "revolutionary spirit," but rather a disruption of production and a disregard for revolutionary order, a manifestation of the spread of anarchist trends. Some people want to get new labor protection items before their time; some use the factory's steel for private work, how can this be allowed! Thinking of these things, I tightened my control even more. When encountering people who乱领 materials, I persuade and dissuade them. This way, I have achieved good results.

    合理的规章制度一定要执行
    化工总厂材料员　董化普
    我是个材料员。我体会到，抵制无政府主义思潮，人人有责。咱管材料的，守着国家财物的大门，决不能慷国家财物之慨，干危害革命利益的勾当。
    我发放材料卡得紧一些，有人就给我提一大堆意见，说我尽拿制度“卡”人。又批评我“不能破除旧框框”，“没有造反精神”！
    听到这些意见，我头脑里七上八下。我想，是制度不合理吗？是它因袭成规，妨碍了生产吗？不！不是！事实上，凡是发放手套、口罩、劳作服等劳动保护品，都按期交旧换新；供应工程需要的材料，是根据工程实际需要来拨。这有什么不对的呢？
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，……”不合理的规章制度，要彻底破除，这是完全应该的，但对长期生产实践积累出来的好经验、好办法，不分青红皂白，一律扔光，这并不是什么“造反精神”，而是破坏生产，不要革命秩序，是无政府主义思潮泛滥的一种表现。有个别人没到期就要领新劳动保护品；有的拿厂里的钢材干私活，这怎么行呢！想到这些，我卡得更紧了。遇到乱领材料的人，我就说服和劝阻。我这样做，收到了很好的效果。
