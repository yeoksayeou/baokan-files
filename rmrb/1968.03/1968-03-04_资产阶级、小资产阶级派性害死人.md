Chairman Mao teaches us: "Anything reactionary, if you don't hit it, it won't fall." Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a reactionary ideology that must be thoroughly overthrown. Otherwise, if one is poisoned by factionalism, one will not be able to distinguish between friends and enemies, right and wrong, will treat enemies as friends, and friends as enemies, and will not be able to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	Liu Yonghai: Factionalism really kills people. At that time, we were entangled by this big poisonous snake of factionalism, forgot Chairman Mao's teachings, and couldn't tell who was a friend and who was an enemy. Those who agreed with my views were comrades, and those who didn't were enemies. To suppress the other side, we exaggerated their shortcomings, and without distinguishing right from wrong, we regarded the leaders of the opposing organization as "stubborn" "bad leaders." Under this kind of thinking, factionalism became more and more intense, and "internal wars" became more and more fierce. To achieve victory for our faction, we sought support from everywhere. As long as someone supported us, we would regard them as comrades. When the army came to help us solve problems, we pushed the responsibility onto the other side. Now, through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, I realize that my responsibility is great.

	Liu Shikuang: Talking about the harm of factionalism, looking back at myself, I am truly ashamed.

	When Liu Yonghai's fighting team was established, the masses who were oppressed by the bourgeois reactionary line all stood up, with over a hundred and thirty people signing up in one day. While our fighting team had only thirty-plus people when it was established. I thought that although our numbers were few, the truth was on our side. After our fighting team was established, we wrote big-character posters and quoted Chairman Mao's instructions, each taking what was needed, using what was beneficial to us. Looking back now, all of this was a manifestation of factionalism. We took a utilitarian attitude towards the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions, which was a great mistake.

	At that time, in our factory, big-character posters and big debates could no longer proceed normally. The two factions, as soon as they met, were like enemies, glaring at each other, and cursing each other. I told the core members: "People have faces, trees have bark. Can we, as adults, take insults? If they curse me, I'll curse them back. We must be confrontational." This way, the more we cursed, the greater the anger, the deeper the contradictions, and the more the problems could not be solved, even leading to armed clashes. We never examined ourselves for mistakes but instead blamed Liu Yonghai for everything, waiting to "settle accounts in the autumn." This way, the antagonism between the two factions became even greater.

	Liu Yonghai: Factionalism is a big poisonous snake. If it is not cut off, it will always be harmful. The army's left-supporting troops helped our factory implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve revolutionary great unity. But what attitude did our faction take? A few leaders said: Chairman Mao proposed revolutionary great unity, not responding to it is conservatism. We should take a high stance, unwilling to unite in our hearts but shouting for unity with our mouths. Because our faction was talking about unity while holding onto factionalism, the result was that in order to raise what banner to report to the higher-ups, we started arguing again. We united in the morning, and by the afternoon, it was blown off.

	Liu Shikuang: Talking about unity, without overthrowing factionalism, it is impossible. That day, the army comrades on the stage said: Follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seek great unity, and tolerate minor differences. I thought in my heart: You are just smoothing things over. I had my own ideas in my heart, but on the surface, I acted very enthusiastically.

	When we held a core meeting to study the unity issue, I said: Now is the time for great unity, and we must unite. I also said, even if we don't want to unite in our hearts, we must shout for unity with our mouths and paint big slogans. If the other side doesn't want to unite and disrupts great unity, the blame will fall on them; if the other side wants to unite, we must not give in on core issues and banner issues. After unity, the number of core members must be the same as theirs; on their original united committee's banner, we must definitely add a "great" character, otherwise, the masses will say we have surrendered to them.

	In the afternoon, after the mobilization meeting was over, the army took us from both factions to discuss the issue of reporting good news. What banner should we raise? Just for the issue of adding or not adding a "great" character, the two factions argued fiercely.

    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性害死人
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”资产阶级、小资产阶级派性就是一种反动思潮，必须彻底打倒。否则，中了派性的毒，就会敌我不分，是非不清，把敌人当朋友，把朋友当敌人，就不能全面落实毛主席的最新指示。
    刘永海：派性可真是害死人。那时，我们被派性这条大毒蛇缠住了，就忘记了毛主席的教导，分不清谁是朋友，谁是敌人。谁同意我的观点就是同志，谁不同意我的观点就是敌人。为了压倒对方，把对方的缺点无限上纲，甚至不分青红皂白，把对方组织的负责人看成是“顽固不化”的“坏头头”，在这种思想的支配下，派性越闹越大，“内战”越打越凶。为了我这一派的胜利，到处找人支持，只要有人支持，我就一律把他们当作同志。解放军来帮助我们解决问题，我们就把责任推给对方。现在通过斗私批修，我认识到我的责任很大。
    刘士宽：谈到派性的危害，回过头来看看自己，真是惭愧。
    刘永海他们的战斗队一成立，受资产阶级反动路线压迫的群众都起来了，一天报名的就有一百三十多人。而我们战斗队，成立时才三十多人。我认为，我们人数虽少，但真理在我们方面。我们这个战斗队成立后，写大字报，引用毛主席的指示，也是各取所需，对我们有利的就用。现在看来，这都是派性的恶性发作。我们对伟大领袖毛主席的指示，竟然采取实用主义的态度，这是极大的错误。
    当时，在我们厂里，大字报、大辩论已经不能正常进行。两派一见面，就好象仇人一样分外眼红，彼此对骂。我对核心成员讲：“人有脸，树有皮，咱们这么大人能挨骂？他骂我也骂，要针锋相对。”这样，越骂火气越大，矛盾越深，问题越得不到解决，甚至发生武斗。我们从不检查自己有没有错误，而是把帐记在刘永海的身上，等待“秋后算帐”。这样就造成两派之间更加对立。
    刘永海：派性是条大毒蛇，什么时候不斩断，什么时候都会受它的毒害。解放军支左部队帮助我们厂落实毛主席的最新指示，实现了革命大联合。可我这一派抱什么态度呢？几个头头说：毛主席提出革命大联合，不响应，这不是保守吗？要高姿态嘛，心里不愿联合，嘴里要喊联合。由于我这派是抱住派性谈联合，结果为了打什么旗帜去向上级报喜，又吵起来了。上午联合，下午就吹了。
    刘士宽：说起联合来，不打倒派性，根本办不到。那天，解放军同志在台上讲：紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，求大同，存小异。我在下面就想：你们纯粹是和稀泥。我心里有自己的一套，但是表面上却装得挺热情似的。
    当我们召开核心会，研究联合问题的时候，我却讲：现在是大联合的形势，不联合不行。还说，心里不愿意联合，口里也得喊联合，大标语也得猛刷。如果对方不愿意联合，破坏大联合的罪名就落在他们身上；如果对方愿意，我们在核心问题和旗帜问题上一定不能让步。联合以后，核心的人数，我们一定要同他们一样多；在他们原来联合委员会的旗帜上，一定得添个“大”字，不添个“大”字，群众会说我们投降他们了。
    下午，动员会一散，解放军就找我们两派一块商量报喜问题。打什么旗帜去呢？就为添不添个“大”字，两派闹得不可开交。
