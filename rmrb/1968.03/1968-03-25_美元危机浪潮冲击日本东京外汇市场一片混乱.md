Title: Dollar Crisis Waves Hit Tokyo's Foreign Exchange Market in Chaos

The dollar crisis waves have struck the Tokyo foreign exchange market, causing chaos. According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 22nd, Tokyo reports that under the current financial crisis that is shaking the entire imperialist system, Japanese monopoly capital, which has long been tightly dependent on U.S. imperialism since the end of World War II, has fallen into extreme panic.

As the gold-buying frenzy swept across Western Europe, the yen was quickly drawn into the dollar crisis vortex, and the Tokyo foreign exchange market was in chaos. Because the yen's position is even weaker than the dollar, the Japanese financial sector generally fears that if the yen devalues, it will definitely devalue more than the dollar; thus, a wave of selling yen and buying dollars swept the market. Faced with this critical situation, Japanese monopoly capital, in order to prevent the yen from devaluing before the dollar, had to sell large amounts of dollars, which it had long regarded as a "deity," and buy yen to stabilize the yen's exchange rate.

Under the influence of the gold-buying frenzy, Japan, which lacks gold reserves, even saw a phenomenon of buying gold and silver medals, causing the prices of various medals to soar. For example, a set of medals that originally cost 6,000 yen is now worth 20,000 yen; some gold medals can be sold for 10,000 yen each.

What particularly terrified the Japanese ruling class was that the dollar crisis would inevitably trigger Japan's foreign exchange crisis. Reports indicate that Japan's current foreign exchange reserves are less than two-thirds of actual needs, and gold reserves are particularly lacking, with most being U.S. paper currency. The latest issue of Japan's "Economist" magazine points out that if the dollar devalues, Japan will be the most affected. Moreover, this financial crisis will directly impact Japan's absorption of foreign capital from Europe and America. The "Japan Economic News" on the 16th stated that the Sato government and the Japanese banking sector fear that in the process of the collapse of the capitalist world monetary system dominated by the dollar, nearly $1.5 billion in European foreign exchange will flow out of Japan, and it will become even more difficult to absorb U.S. funds, "causing foreign exchange funds to be in short supply."

Additionally, since one-third of Japan's foreign trade relies on exports to the United States, the Japanese monopoly groups are particularly dissatisfied and anxious about the Johnson administration's measures to "defend the dollar" by restricting the import of Japanese goods. They are concerned that the U.S.'s practice of shifting the crisis to Japan will significantly impact Japan's exports, leading to a larger trade deficit and an even more unstable yen position.

All of this has created a panic atmosphere in the Japanese financial sector. Japan's financial giants have been wailing in unison. The president of Sumitomo Bank, Horita Shozo, said: This dollar crisis may develop into "great chaos" in the capitalist economic system, and the capitalist world is "facing a serious test since the 1930s." The president of Fuji Bank, Iwasa Keijitsu, said that in the face of the dollar crisis, "regrettably, Japan is almost powerless." "The Mainichi News" lamented: The Japanese authorities "have no power to stop the gold turmoil," and "they have no solution. This is the harsh reality facing Japan's economy, which has been thrown into confusion by the gold turmoil."

### 美元危机浪潮冲击日本东京外汇市场一片混乱

    美元危机浪潮冲击日本东京外汇市场一片混乱
    据新华社二十二日讯 东京消息：在当前震撼着整个帝国主义制度的金融危机袭击下，第二次世界大战后一直紧紧依附于美帝国主义的日本垄断资本陷入了极度的恐慌。
    在抢购黄金风潮横扫西欧的同时，日元也很快地被卷进了美元危机的漩涡，东京外汇市场一片混乱。由于日元地位比美元更加虚弱，日本金融界普遍担心日元一旦贬值，肯定会比美元贬值的幅度还大；于是市场上刮起了抛售日元、抢购美元的风潮。面对着这种危急局势，日本垄断资本为了防止日元先于美元贬值，不得不大量抛售一向被它视为“神灵”的美元，购进日元，以稳定日元的比价。
    在抢购黄金风潮的影响下，缺乏黄金储备的日本甚至出现了抢购金质和银质奖章的现象，使得各种奖章的价格猛涨。例如，原来值六千日元一套的奖章，现在已涨到二万日元；有的一枚金质奖章就可以卖一万日元。
    而特别使日本统治集团感到恐慌的是，美元危机将不可避免地引起日本的外汇危机。据报道，日本目前的外汇储备不到实际需要的三分之二，而其中黄金储备更为缺乏，大部分是美元纸币。最近一期的日本《经济学人》杂志指出，如果美元贬值，日本受害最大。不仅如此，这次金融危机还将直接影响日本从欧美吸收外资。《日本经济新闻》十六日说，佐藤政府和日本银行界害怕在美元占统治地位的资本主义世界货币体制崩溃的过程中，会使近十五亿美元的欧洲外汇从日本流出，并使吸收美国资金越发困难，“造成外汇资金周转不灵”。
    另外，由于日本对外贸易的三分之一要依靠向美国出口，日本垄断集团对约翰逊政府为“保卫美元”而采取的限制日货进口的措施特别感到不满和不安。他们担心美国这种向日本转嫁危机的做法会使日本的出口大受影响，以致国际收支出现更大的赤字，日元地位更加不稳。
    所有这一切，使日本金融界弥漫着恐慌气氛，日本的金融巨头纷纷大发哀鸣。住友银行总经理堀田庄三说：这次美元危机很可能发展成资本主义经济体制的“极大混乱”，资本主义世界“正面临着三十年代以来的严重考验”。富士银行总经理岩佐凯实说，在美元危机面前，“很遗憾，日本几乎完全无能为力”。《每日新闻》哀叹：日本当局“没有力量制止黄金骚动”，它“拿不出任何办法。而这就是被黄金骚动搞得晕头转向的日本经济面临的严酷现实”。
