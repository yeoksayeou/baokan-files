Albania's socialist construction is thriving. The Vlorë alkali plant has started production, and the lamp factory has begun construction. Comrade Shehu attended the celebration and laid the foundation stone for the lamp factory construction project.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tirana on the 11th, a mass rally was held in Vlorë on the 9th to celebrate the commencement of production at the alkali plant and the start of construction at the lamp factory.

On this day, the coastal city of Vlorë on the Adriatic Sea was filled with a festive atmosphere. Workers from the Vlorë district, members of agricultural production cooperatives, cadres, and students gathered joyfully in front of the factory gate of the Vlorë alkali plant, holding portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, red flags, and banners. The stage of the meeting was adorned with large portraits of the great leaders of the Albanian and Chinese peoples, Comrade Enver Hoxha and Chairman Mao, as well as the national flags of Albania and China.

Albanian Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu, Deputy Prime Minister Beqir Balluku, and relevant department heads attended the celebration. Chinese Charge d'Affaires Li Tingqian and Economic Counselor Zhou Ping were also invited to attend.

Albanian Minister of Industry and Mines Todi Shkurti first spoke at the meeting. He expressed warm congratulations to the people of Vlorë on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the Council of Ministers, and the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Shkurti said that the commencement of production at the Vlorë alkali plant will fully meet the needs of the country's petroleum, textile, papermaking, soap, glass, and other chemical industries for caustic soda and caustic potash. Thus, the country not only has rid itself of the previous situation of importing this industrial necessity from abroad but also has created conditions for the further development of the chemical industry itself.

He said that the Vlorë alkali plant is an important project started during the third five-year plan of Albania, with the help of internationalism from the People's Republic of China. We once again express our sincere thanks to the Communist Party of China and the great Marxist-Leninist, our party and people's respected friend, Comrade Mao Zedong, the government of the People's Republic of China, and all the people of China for this assistance. We believe that these projects will further strengthen the friendship between our two parties, forged on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, which binds our two peoples together.

Chinese Charge d'Affaires Li Tingqian, on behalf of the Chinese embassy and the Chinese engineering and technical personnel who helped build the alkali plant, extended warm congratulations to the fraternal Albanian people and the Albanian workers who built this factory.

He enthusiastically praised the heroic Albanian people, who, under the correct leadership of the glorious Albanian Party of Labor headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Enver Hoxha, have achieved tremendous successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. He enthusiastically praised the great friendship and combat unity between the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Amidst warm applause, Comrade Shehu laid the foundation stone for the construction of the Vlorë lamp factory, and Comrade Balluku cut the ribbon for the official commencement of production at the Vlorë alkali plant.

At the end of the meeting, the crowd repeatedly shouted, "Enver—Mao Zedong!"

    据新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚发罗拉市九日举行群众集会，庆祝制碱厂投入生产和灯泡厂开工建设。
    这一天，亚得里亚海滨的发罗拉市，一片欢腾景象。发罗拉区的工人、农业生产合作社社员、干部和学生举着毛主席和霍查同志的画像，举着红旗和标语牌，欢欣鼓舞地集聚在发罗拉制碱厂厂房大门前的广场上。大会的主席台上，高挂着阿中两国人民的伟大领袖霍查同志和毛主席的巨幅画像，以及阿中两国国旗。

    他说，发罗拉制碱厂是在中华人民共和国国际主义的帮助下，阿尔巴尼亚第三个五年计划期间开始建设的重要项目之一。对于这种援助，我们再次向中国共产党和伟大的马克思列宁主义者、我们党和人民的尊敬的朋友毛泽东同志、中华人民共和国政府和全中国人民，表示真诚的感谢。我们相信，这些项目将进一步加强我们两党在马克思列宁主义基础上锤炼起来的、把我们两国人民联结在一起的友谊。
    中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办李庭荃代表中国大使馆和帮助建设制碱厂的中国工程技术人员，向兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民和建设这个工厂的阿尔巴尼亚职工表示热烈的祝贺。
    他热烈赞扬英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的巨大成就。他热情称颂中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志亲自缔造的中阿友谊和战斗团结。
    在热烈的掌声中，谢胡同志为发罗拉灯泡厂建设工程破土奠基，查尔查尼同志为发罗拉制碱厂正式投入生产剪彩。
    大会结束时，群众不断高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东！”
