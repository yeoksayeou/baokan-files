Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy." Comrades attending the first conference of active learners and users of Mao Zedong Thought at the People's Liberation Army Political Academy, filled with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, deeply studied Chairman Mao's great program for party building, criticized the revisionist party line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and focused on criticizing his heinous crimes of destroying the Party's democratic centralism.

Comrades pointed out: How to handle the Party's democratic centralism is a very important issue in party building and is a major matter concerning the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, through long-term great revolutionary practice, brilliantly and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism on democratic centralism. Democratic centralism is the fundamental system of the Party and the state. The Party relies on this system to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of Party members and the people in the arduous and unyielding struggle of the revolution, to overcome powerful domestic and foreign enemies, and to achieve one great victory after another.

Comrades pointed out: Whether to uphold or destroy the Party's democratic centralism is always closely linked to the struggle between the two lines within the Party. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers and, fundamentally speaking, is a line of coming from the masses and going to the masses. Therefore, it is necessary to implement democratic centralism. It is necessary to fully develop democracy within and outside the Party and, on the basis of high democracy, strengthen the Party's centralized and unified leadership. The struggle between the two lines within the Party has always revolved around the issue of the masses and, therefore, cannot but be reflected in the attitude towards democratic centralism. All "left" and right opportunists, in order to push their opportunist political line, must push an opportunist organizational line and destroy the Party's democratic centralism.

Everyone angrily pointed out: For decades, the Chinese Khrushchev has consistently destroyed the Party's democratic centralism. On the one hand, he opposes proletarian democracy, peddles the "tame tool" theory, and advocates slavery; on the other hand, he opposes proletarian centralism, emphasizes spontaneous movements of the masses, and advocates anarchism. Two kinds of goods, one purpose, is to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, push his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and attempt to turn the Party into a revisionist party, a fascist party, to achieve his evil goal of usurping the Party and the state, restoring capitalism. We proletarian revolutionaries must firmly uphold the great red banner of Chairman Mao's party line, resolutely defend the principles of the Party's democratic centralism, ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and ensure that our Party and state will never change color.

Fully develop democracy, oppose the "tame tool" theory

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Expanding intra-party democracy should be regarded as a necessary step to consolidate and develop the Party, as an important weapon to make the Party lively and cheerful, happy and satisfied in great struggles, to grow new strength, and to break through the difficulties of war." Chairman Mao has always emphasized the construction of the Party's democratic centralism and stressed that the Party's centralism is based on democracy. Therefore, Chairman Mao has always advocated fully developing intra-party democracy, activating party life, and adhering to the mass line in all work. Any bad habit of suppressing democracy and being arbitrary is incompatible with the nature of our Party and is absolutely not allowed. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, out of counter-revolutionary political needs, has consistently and frantically opposed the development of intra-party democracy, saying that "intra-party democracy should not be generally emphasized" and that developing democracy will "loosen party unity and loosen the fighting will within the Party." He openly opposes Chairman Mao's instructions to expand democracy within and outside the Party, which is audacious and extremely detestable!

Will developing intra-party democracy really "loosen party unity and loosen the fighting will within the Party"? Our Party is strong and powerful because, in the revolutionary struggle, it has consistently implemented democratic centralism and fully developed intra-party democracy, which has enabled the Party to continuously develop, consolidate, and strengthen. Because only by fully developing intra-party democracy can the enthusiasm of the entire Party be mobilized, the wisdom of all revolutionary people be fully utilized, will and action be unified. As early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The material life of the Red Army is so meager, and the battles are so frequent, yet it can be maintained without collapse, apart from the role of the Party, it is also due to the implementation of democracy within the army." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our great leader Chairman Mao personally led the Rectification Movement in Yan'an. Because intra-party democracy was fully developed, our Party achieved unprecedented unity in ideology, politics, and organization, laying the foundation for defeating Japanese imperialism and winning the War of Liberation. Currently, the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao is the broadest, most thorough, and greatest democracy under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. This great democracy has mobilized the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people to the greatest extent, exposed a handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, and spies within the Party, and destroyed the bourgeois command headquarters hidden within the Party. The facts have proven that adhering to the Party's democratic centralism and fully developing intra-party democracy will not "loosen party unity and loosen the fighting will within the Party"; on the contrary, it makes our Party purer, more united, more cohesive, stronger, and more vigorous. The claim by the Chinese Khrushchev that developing democracy will loosen "unity" and loosen "fighting will" is pure nonsense, completely aimed at suppressing democracy, stifling the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, implementing a policy of keeping the people in the dark, creating "tame tools," and paving the way for his counter-revolutionary line of restoring capitalism.

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought hold that proletarian democracy is an important weapon for the proletariat to defeat the bourgeoisie. Proletarian democracy is a necessity for proletarian revolutionary struggle and serves proletarian politics. With proletarian and laboring people's democracy, there is no bourgeois and all kinds of demonic democracy. Therefore, various representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks will inevitably do everything they can to destroy the Party's democratic centralism and oppose proletarian democracy. The Chinese Khrushchev absurdly says that democracy must have "restrictions" and that without the "permission" of the "superiors," it is an "illegal activity." In reality, he wants to abolish proletarian democracy and implement fascist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. His so-called "superiors" and "permission" are the "permission" of the bourgeois command headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, which is extremely reactionary. It is precisely this Chinese Khrushchev who, in this great proletarian cultural revolution, feeling that his doom is approaching, again resorted to his so-called "regulations of the superiors," "internal and external distinctions," "restrictions," and other fallacies, distorting right and wrong, confusing black and white, suppressing the masses, implementing white terror, encircling the revolutionary faction, and sabotaging the great proletarian cultural revolution. We proletarian revolutionaries must firmly uphold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully use the great democracy advocated by our great leader Chairman Mao, overthrow the handful of capitalist roaders headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, overthrow them, seize their power, and throw them into the garbage heap of history, so that they will never be able to rise again.

Chairman Mao pointed out: The Chinese people and the army need democracy. "Whether inside or outside the Party, there must be a full democratic life, that is, democratic centralism must be genuinely implemented." Proletarian democratic centralism is centralism based on extensive democracy and democracy under highly centralized guidance. Without extensive democracy, there can be no genuine centralism. Without fully developing democracy, it is impossible to broadly listen to the opinions of the masses, to mobilize the wisdom of the masses, to correctly summarize experience and lessons, and to formulate good lines, policies, and measures. If there is no democracy and various opinions are not fully listened to, but problems are decided by the superior leadership organs based on one-sided or untrue materials, it is inevitable that it will not be objective and, therefore, it will not be possible to achieve genuine centralized unity. Therefore, the kind of centralism without extensive democracy is only false, empty, and erroneous. Everyone angrily pointed out: The Chinese Khrushchev slandered proletarian democracy as "idle talk" and "empty talk," openly declaring that "the system in our army," "work organs," and even "schools" are "not democratic centralism." This fully exposed the ugly face of the Chinese Khrushchev, a descendant of the landlord bourgeoisie, who suppresses democracy and advocates fascist dictatorship.

Comrades unanimously emphasized: The attitude towards proletarian democracy is an attitude towards the people, a fundamental stance issue, and a worldview issue. Fear of democracy is fear of the masses. We proletarian revolutionary fighters believe that our cause is completely consistent with the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers. We must always follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, dare to fully develop democracy, and mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of people to the greatest extent to carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

Comrades angrily pointed out: The Chinese Khrushchev shamelessly destroyed democratic centralism and abolished intra-party democracy, aiming to sever the Party's connection with the masses, stifle the life of the Party, and turn our Party into a revisionist party, turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. This is sheer fantasy.

Strengthen centralized unity, oppose anarchism

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party not only needs democracy but especially needs centralism." First democracy, then centralism; without high democracy, there can be no high centralism, and without high centralism, there can be no unified leadership of the Party, no proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, and no establishment of socialism.

Our Party is a vanguard organization leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy. To defeat the enemy, it is necessary to ensure the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, to ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to have strict organizational discipline. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee has consistently overcome the state of indiscipline and anarchist tendencies that exist in many places, continuously opposed individualism and sectarianism, and built our Party into a centralized and unified party. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, in the democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories.

Comrades unanimously pointed out: The centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao is the unity of consciousness, policy, plan, command, and action realized on the basis of fully developing democracy and concentrating correct opinions. Without this centralized unity, there is no policy, no leadership, and no authority. The centralized and unified leadership of the Party is not only reflected in the formulation of unified lines, policies, and plans but also in the implementation of all these in the masses, turning them into conscious actions of the masses. Therefore, centralized and unified leadership is not empty but relies on the various levels of Party and government organizations and revolutionary cadres to implement it. Chairman Mao said: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." This old counter-revolutionary, the Chinese Khrushchev, not only suppresses proletarian democracy but also frantically destroys proletarian centralism and abolishes the Party's centralized and unified leadership. He hysterically shouts that "we do not rely on cadres, government, or the Party" and that "we mainly rely on the spontaneous movement of the masses" and that "the masses can do whatever they want." Isn't this fundamentally negating proletarian centralism and advocating extreme reactionary anarchism?

Comrades angrily criticized the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three not rely on."

Chairman Mao teaches us to "believe in and rely on the majority of cadres." Everyone pointed out: Our broad revolutionary cadres have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. They are loyal to Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the long-term revolutionary struggle and have accumulated rich experience in struggle, have strong organizational and work abilities, and have made certain contributions to the Party's revolutionary cause. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party are only a small number. It is under the leadership of Chairman Mao that our Party, relying on the broad revolutionary cadres, has united and led the Chinese people to achieve one great victory after another in the revolution and construction. The Chinese Khrushchev has always regarded the broad revolutionary cadres who are loyal to Chairman Mao as thorns in the eye and flesh in the flesh, consistently excluding, striking, and framing them. In the land reform movement, he made a big fuss about "moving stones"; in the socialist education movement, he again carried out the "great replacement" of "left" in form and "right" in essence; in this great proletarian cultural revolution, he even more frantically "struck a large area and protected a small number." The Chinese Khrushchev's shouting that he does not rely on cadres is a vicious plot to use anarchism to sabotage the Party's centralized and unified leadership and to resist Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Comrades unanimously expressed: In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries must expose the Chinese Khrushchev's plot, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres, and dare to liberate a large area and strike a small number. For revolutionary cadres who have made different mistakes, we must enthusiastically help them recognize and correct their mistakes and actively support them to stand up and make new contributions to the people. Currently, solving the cadre issue is a key to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Comrades also pointed out: Our government is the power of the proletarian dictatorship under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Chinese Communist Party. We rely on our state power to resist the aggression of imperialism, suppress the resistance of domestic class enemies, and defend the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Chinese Khrushchev's shouting that he does not rely on the government is to use anarchism to oppose the proletarian dictatorship, so as to facilitate his restoration of capitalism.

In the current great proletarian cultural revolution, the anarchism peddled by the Chinese Khrushchev is also reflected in the sabotage of the revolutionary committees. The revolutionary committees established in the great proletarian cultural revolution are new powers. We proletarian revolutionaries must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, encircle and suppress anarchism, fully support the revolutionary committees, consciously maintain the authority of the proletarian revolution, and smash all sabotage and disruption by class enemies at any time.

Comrades also pointed out: Our Party is the great leader Chairman Mao's personally created and nurtured Party, the core force leading the Chinese revolution, and the mainstay of the world revolution. Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China; without the Communist Party, there would be no great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction; without the Communist Party, there would be no people's today. The Chinese Khrushchev dares to propose not relying on the Party's leadership and abolishing the Party's leadership, which fully exposes him as a traitor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The reactionary essence of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three not rely on" is to not want the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to abolish proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. The Chinese Khrushchev's decades of counter-revolutionary actions fully prove: he does not want cadres, but only wants cadres who are not loyal to Chairman Mao, such as capitalist roaders, traitors, and spies; he does not want the government, but only wants the bourgeois government; he does not want the Party, but only wants the revisionist party, the fascist party. In short, before the proletariat seizes power, he strives to maintain the rule of the reactionary classes; after the proletariat seizes power, he wants to restore capitalism.

The Chinese Khrushchev maliciously says that "the masses can do whatever they want" and that "we mainly rely on the spontaneous movement of the masses." This is the most blatant opposition to the Party's leadership and the peddling of anarchism. Lenin pointed out: Any worship of the spontaneity of the workers' movement is to strengthen the influence of the bourgeois ideological system on the workers. "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are not the products of spontaneous movements. Only by infusing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought into the masses can there be a genuine revolutionary mass movement. The Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies are to lead the masses astray, deviate from the track of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and achieve his evil goal of sabotaging the revolution and serving the landlord bourgeoisie, which is absolutely impossible.

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, making a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." This is a highly summarized experience of the Chinese revolution and world revolution, and it is the greatest truth of the contemporary world. It expresses the voice of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people and is the strongest voice of our era. The centralized and unified leadership of the Party is centralized and unified under Mao Zedong Thought, centralized and unified under Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and centralized and unified under the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the greatest genius of the contemporary world, the greatest Marxist-Leninist, and the red sun in the hearts of all Chinese people and revolutionary people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary world, the science of proletarian revolution, the representative of the fundamental interests of the proletariat and laboring people, and the lifeline of revolutionary people. The Chinese revolution and world revolution have repeatedly proven that without Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution will suffer setbacks and fail; with Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, the revolution will develop and win. The prosperity of China relies on Mao Zedong Thought, and the liberation of the world's people also relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

With Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, to do a good job of the ideological revolution of the people is a matter of life and death for the state, the Party, and the power, and it is a primary and important issue of whether the people will gain everything or lose everything. The current great proletarian cultural revolution movement in our country is a great democracy under the absolute leadership of the highest authority of Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. This high democracy and high centralism ensure the victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution. We proletarian revolutionaries must consciously defend Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the centralized and unified leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. This is the purest party spirit, the most noble duty, and the most glorious combat mission.

Strictly adhering to the principles of democratic centralism is an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

The unity of proletarian democracy and centralism is to come from the masses and go to the masses, to combine leadership with the masses, which is the basic principle to ensure the correct leadership of our Party.

Chairman Mao said: "Within the people, democracy is relative to centralism, and freedom is relative to discipline. These are two contradictory aspects of a unity, they are contradictory and at the same time unified. We should not emphasize one aspect while denying the other. Within the people, there must be no freedom, nor must there be no discipline; there must be no democracy, nor must there be no centralism. This unity of democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, is our democratic centralism." This is the most complete, scientific, and profound exposition by our great leader Chairman Mao on proletarian democratic centralism. Chairman Mao clearly tells us that it is absolutely not allowed to separate democracy from centralism. It is democratic and at the same time centralized. There is no unbridgeable chasm between democracy and centralism. However, the Chinese Khrushchev insists on separating democracy from centralism, absurdly saying that "Party leaders and superior organs should pay more attention to democracy; Party members and subordinate organs should obey more." This is all nonsense, aimed at creating chaos. We know that proletarian democratic centralism requires that Party leaders at all levels must, on the basis of extensive democracy, concentrate the correct opinions of the masses; the broad masses of Party members must, under centralized guidance, fully exercise their democratic rights, care for the Party's cause, "dare to and be good at raising questions, expressing opinions, criticizing shortcomings, and supervising the leading organs and leading cadres from the perspective of caring." The Chinese Khrushchev's absurd claim that superiors should "pay more attention to democracy" and subordinates should "obey more" is, in essence, using the name of democracy to practice dictatorship, false democracy, and true dictatorship, fundamentally distorting and negating proletarian democratic centralism.

Comrades realized: Proletarian democratic centralism has great significance in the political life of the Party and the state. Consciously, seriously, and strictly adhering to the principles of democratic centralism is an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and loyalty to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. It is a manifestation of the strong party spirit of the proletariat. In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, adhering to and implementing democratic centralism inevitably encounters sabotage and interference from the right and the "ultra-left." We must maintain high vigilance against this. In the current great proletarian cultural revolution, reactionary anarchism and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism are the great enemies of implementing democratic centralism. Everyone emphasized: Class enemies will inevitably use bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism to sabotage the great proletarian cultural revolution and interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, opposing the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. We proletarian revolutionaries, in order to achieve a comprehensive victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution, must resolutely fight against the reactionary anarchist trend and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism are manifestations of the reactionary bourgeois worldview. Their core is the character of "self."

Comrades unanimously expressed: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive even harder to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticize self, criticize revisionism" as the key, and trigger a revolution in the depths of the soul, continuously transform the worldview, promote ideological revolutionization, ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution!

　　民主集中制是贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的重要保证
　　人民解放军政治学院首次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子大会批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线座谈会纪要
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”中国人民解放军政治学院出席首次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子大会的同志们，满怀对伟大统帅毛主席无限忠诚的心情，深入地学习了毛主席这一整党建党的伟大纲领，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义的建党路线，着重批判了他破坏党的民主集中制的滔天罪行。
    同志们指出：如何对待党的民主集中制，是党的建设中一个极其重要的问题，是关系到贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大事。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席，在长期的伟大革命实践中，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于民主集中制的思想。民主集中制是党和国家的根本制度。党依靠这一制度，在革命艰苦卓绝的斗争中，极大地调动了广大党员和人民群众的积极性，战胜了强大的国内外敌人，使革命取得了一个又一个伟大胜利。
    同志们指出：坚持还是破坏党的民主集中制，总是同党内两条路线的斗争紧密联系着的。毛主席的革命路线，是代表无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益的，从根本上说，就是从群众中来到群众中去的路线。为此，就必须实行民主集中制。既要在党内外充分发扬民主，又要在高度民主的基础上加强党的集中统一领导。党内两条路线的斗争一直围绕在群众的问题上，也就不能不反映在对待民主集中制的态度上。一切“左”右倾机会主义者，为了推行他们的机会主义的政治路线，必然要推行一条机会主义的组织路线，破坏党的民主集中制。
    大家愤怒指出：中国赫鲁晓夫几十年来，一贯地破坏党的民主集中制。他一面反对无产阶级的民主制，兜售“驯服工具”论，宣扬奴隶主义；一面反对无产阶级的集中制，强调群众的自发运动，鼓吹无政府主义。两种货色，一个目的，就是为了反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，推行其反革命修正主义路线，妄图把党变为修正主义党、法西斯党，以达到其篡党篡国、复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。我们无产阶级革命派，就是要高举毛主席建党路线的伟大红旗，坚决捍卫党的民主集中制的原则，保证毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行，保证我们的党和国家永不变色。
    充分发扬民主，反对“驯服工具”论
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“扩大党内民主，应看作是巩固党和发展党的必要的步骤，是使党在伟大斗争中生动活跃，胜任愉快，生长新的力量，突破战争难关的一个重要的武器。”毛主席一贯强调党的民主集中制的建设，强调党的集中是以民主作基础的。所以，毛主席历来主张充分发扬党内民主，活跃党的民主生活，在一切工作中坚持群众路线。任何压制民主、独断专横的恶劣作风，都是同我党的性质不相容的，是绝对不允许的。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫出于反革命的政治需要，一贯地、疯狂地反对发扬党内民主，胡说什么“党内民主不一般地强调”，发扬民主会“松懈党内团结，松懈党内战斗意志”。公然与毛主席的扩大党内外民主的指示相对抗，真是狗胆包天，可恶之极！
    发扬党内民主果真会“松懈党内团结，松懈党内战斗意志”吗？我党之所以坚强有力量，在革命的斗争中，不断地得到发展、巩固和壮大，是同我党坚决贯彻民主集中制，充分发扬党内民主分不开的。因为，只有充分发扬党内民主，才能调动全党的积极性，充分发挥一切革命人民的智慧，统一意志，统一行动。远在第二次国内革命战争时期，我们伟大领袖毛主席就指出：“红军的物质生活如此菲薄，战斗如此频繁，仍能维持不敝，除党的作用外，就是靠实行军队内的民主主义。”在抗日战争时期，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的延安整风，由于充分地发扬了党内民主，使我党在思想上、政治上、组织上达到空前的统一，为打败日本帝国主义和赢得解放战争的胜利奠定了基础。目前，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政条件下的一次最广泛、最充分、最大的民主。这个大民主，最大限度地调动了亿万革命人民群众的积极性，揪出了党内一小撮走资派和叛徒、特务，摧毁了隐藏在党内的资产阶级司令部。事实证明，坚持党的民主集中制，充分发扬党内民主，不仅不会“松懈党内团结，松懈党内战斗意志”，恰恰相反，使我党更加纯洁、更加团结、更加统一、更加坚强、更加朝气蓬勃。中国赫鲁晓夫所说的发扬民主会松懈“团结”，松懈“战斗意志”，纯粹是胡言乱语，完全是为了扼杀民主，压制人民群众的革命积极性，实行愚民政策，制造“驯服工具”，为其推行复辟资本主义的反革命路线鸣锣开道。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想认为，无产阶级民主制是无产阶级战胜资产阶级的重要武器。无产阶级的民主，是无产阶级革命斗争的需要，是为无产阶级政治服务的。有了无产阶级和劳动人民的民主，就没有资产阶级的和一切牛鬼蛇神的民主。因此，混进革命队伍里的各种资产阶级代表人物，必然千方百计地破坏党的民主集中制，反对无产阶级的民主制。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么民主要有“限制”，不经过“上级”“允许”，就是“非法活动”。实际上就是要取消无产阶级的民主，实行资产阶级法西斯的独裁。他所说的“上级”
  “允许”，就是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的“允许”，真是反动透顶。正是这个中国赫鲁晓夫，在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，感到末日来临，又祭起了他那一套所谓“上级规定”、“内外有别”、要有“限制”等谬论，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，镇压群众，实行白色恐怖，围剿革命派，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。我们无产阶级革命派就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，充分运用伟大领袖毛主席所倡导的无产阶级大民主，造以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的反，革他们的命，夺他们的权，把他们扔进历史的垃圾堆，使他们永世不得翻身。
    毛主席指出：中国人民和军队都是需要民主的，“不论党内党外，都要有充分的民主生活，就是说，都要认真实行民主集中制”。无产阶级民主集中制，是在广泛民主基础上的集中，是在高度集中指导下的民主，没有广泛的民主，就不可能有真正的集中。离开充分发扬民主，就不可能广泛听取群众的意见，就不可能发挥群众的智慧，就不可能正确地总结经验教训，制定出好的路线、方针、政策和办法。如果没有民主，不充分听取各方面的意见，只由上级领导机关凭着片面的或者不真实的材料决定问题，那就难免不是主观主义的，因而也就不可能实现真正的集中统一。所以，没有广泛民主的那种集中，只能是假的、空的、错误的。大家愤怒指出：中国赫鲁晓夫辱骂无产阶级的民主是“闲话”、“清谈”，公然宣称什么“我们军队里面的制度”、“工作机关甚至于学校”，都“不是民主集中制”，这充分暴露了中国赫鲁晓夫这个地主资产阶级的孝子贤孙，压制民主，主张法西斯独裁的丑恶面目。
    同志们一致强调：对待无产阶级民主制的态度问题，就是对待人民群众的态度问题，是个根本立场问题，是个世界观问题。怕民主，就是怕群众。我们无产阶级革命战士，相信自己的事业是同无产阶级和广大劳动人民群众的根本利益完全一致的。我们要永远遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，相信群众，依靠群众，敢于放手发扬民主，最大限度地调动广大人民群众的革命积极性，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    同志们愤怒地指出：中国赫鲁晓夫肆无忌惮地破坏民主集中制，取消党内民主，就是要割断我党和人民群众的联系，窒息党的生命，使我党蜕化成为修正主义的党，使无产阶级专政蜕化为资产阶级专政。这完全是痴心妄想。
    加强集中统一，反对无政府主义
    毛主席教导说：“共产党不但要民主，尤其要集中。”先民主，后集中；没有高度的民主，不可能有高度的集中，而没有高度的集中，就没有党的统一领导，就没有无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，就不可能建立社会主义。
    我们党是领导无产阶级和革命群众对阶级敌人进行战斗的先锋队。要战胜敌人，就要确保以毛主席为首的党中央的集中统一领导，就要确保毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行，就要有严格的组织纪律。以毛主席为首的党中央，在长期的革命斗争中，坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态和无政府主义倾向，不断反对个人主义和宗派主义，把我们的党建设成为一个集中的统一的党。在毛主席的英明领导下，在民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，全国人民，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    同志们一致指出：以毛主席为首的党中央的集中统一，是在充分发扬民主，集中正确意见的基础上，所实现的统一认识，统一政策，统一计划，统一指挥，统一行动。没有这种集中统一，就没有政策，就没有领导，就没有权威。党的集中统一的领导不仅体现在统一的路线、方针、政策的制定，而且还要把这一切在群众中坚持下去，变成群众的自觉行动。所以，集中统一的领导不是空的，而是要依靠党和政府的各级组织和广大革命干部去贯彻执行。毛主席说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”中国赫鲁晓夫这个老反革命，不但扼杀无产阶级的民主制，而且疯狂地破坏无产阶级的集中制，取消党的集中统一领导。他歇斯底里地叫嚷什么“不靠干部、政府、党”，“主要依靠群众的自发运动”，“群众要怎么办就怎么办”。这岂不是从根本上否定了无产阶级集中制，提倡极端反动的无政府主义吗？
    同志们愤怒地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“不靠干部、政府、党”的无政府主义反动谬论。
    毛主席教导我们要“相信和依靠干部的大多数”。大家指出：我们的广大革命干部，是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的，他们在长期的革命斗争中是忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席革命路线的，并且积累了丰富的斗争经验，具有较强的组织能力和工作能力，为党的革命事业作出了一定的贡献。党内走资本主义道路的当权派只是一小撮。我们党在毛主席的英明领导下，正是依靠广大革命干部团结和带领全国人民，取得了革命和建设的一个又一个的伟大胜利。中国赫鲁晓夫对忠于毛主席的广大革命干部，视为眼中钉、肉中刺，一贯地进行排斥、打击、陷害。他在土地改革运动中，大搞“搬石头”；在社会主义教育运动中，又搞形“左”实右的“大换班”；在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，更加疯狂地“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚷什么不靠干部，是他用无政府主义破坏党的集中统一领导，对抗毛主席的革命路线的一个罪恶阴谋。
    同志们一致表示：在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，我们无产阶级革命派，一定要揭穿中国赫鲁晓夫的这一阴谋，坚决执行毛主席对待干部问题的最新指示，敢于解放一大片，打击一小撮。对犯有不同错误的革命干部，要热情帮助他们认识错误改正错误，积极支持他们站出来为人民立新功。在当前，解决好干部问题，是落实毛主席最新指示的一个关键。
    同志们还指出：我们的政府是在伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的中国共产党的英明领导下的无产阶级专政的政权。我们依靠自己的国家政权，抵御帝国主义的侵略，镇压国内阶级敌人的反抗，保卫社会主义革命和社会主义建设。中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚷什么不靠政府，就是用无政府主义来反对无产阶级专政，以便于他搞资本主义复辟。
    在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫所贩卖的这种无政府主义又表现在对革命委员会的破坏。在无产阶级文化大革命中建立起来的各级革命委员会，是新生的政权。我们无产阶级革命派，要坚决遵照毛主席最新指示，围剿无政府主义，全力支持革命委员会，自觉地维护无产阶级革命权威，随时粉碎阶级敌人的一切破坏和捣乱。
    同志们又指出，我们的党是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和培育的，是领导中国革命的核心力量，是世界革命的中流砥柱。没有共产党就没有新中国，没有共产党就没有社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，没有共产党就没有人民的今天。中国赫鲁晓夫胆敢提出不靠党的领导，取消党的领导，这就完全暴露了他是一个十足的无产阶级革命事业的大叛徒。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“三不靠”的反动实质，就是不要中国共产党的领导，取消无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。中国赫鲁晓夫几十年的反革命行径，充分证明：他不是不要干部，只是不要忠于毛主席的革命干部，而要走资派、叛徒、特务；他不是不要政府，只是不要无产阶级的政府，而要资产阶级的政府；他不是不要党，只是不要用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命的党，而要修正主义党，法西斯党。一句话，在无产阶级夺取政权前，他极力维护反动阶级的统治；在无产阶级取得政权后，他就是要复辟资本主义。
    中国赫鲁晓夫别有用心地胡说什么“群众要怎么办就怎么办”，“主要依靠群众的自发运动”。这是最露骨的反对党的领导，贩卖无政府主义。列宁指出：对工人运动自发性的任何崇拜，都是加强资产阶级思想体系对工人的影响。“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。”马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，绝不是自发运动的产物，只有把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想灌输到群众中去，才有真正的革命群众运动。中国赫鲁晓夫这一套反动谬论，就是要把群众引入歧途，背离毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的轨道，以达到其破坏革命，效忠于地主资产阶级的罪恶目的，这是万万办不到的。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”这是中国革命和世界革命经验的高度概括，这是当代世界最伟大的真理。它表达了亿万革命人民的心声，是我们时代的最强音。党的集中统一领导，就是集中统一于毛泽东思想，集中统一于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，集中统一于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。毛主席是当代最伟大的天才，最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是全中国人民和世界革命人民心中最红的红太阳。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级革命的科学，是无产阶级和劳动人民根本利益的代表，是革命人民的命根子。中国革命和世界革命一再证明，离开了毛泽东思想，革命就受挫折，就失败；毛泽东思想挂帅，革命就发展，就胜利。中国的兴旺要靠毛泽东思想，世界人民的解放也要靠毛泽东思想。
    以毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，这是关系到国家的存亡，党的存亡，政权的存亡，是人民得到一切或丧失一切的头等重大问题。当前我国的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是在毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部最高权威的绝对领导下的大民主。这种高度民主和高度集中的统一，保证了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。我们无产阶级革命派，一定要自觉地捍卫毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的集中统一的领导。这是最纯洁的党性，最崇高的职责，最光荣的战斗任务。
    严格按照民主集中制的原则办事是忠于毛主席革命路线的重要标志
    无产阶级的民主制和集中制的统一，就是从群众中来，到群众中去，领导同群众相结合，这是保证我党正确领导的基本原则。
    毛主席说：“在人民内部，民主是对集中而言，自由是对纪律而言。这些都是一个统一体的两个矛盾着的侧面，它们是矛盾的，又是统一的，我们不应当片面地强调某一个侧面而否定另一个侧面。在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。”这是我们伟大领袖毛主席对无产阶级的民主集中制的最完整、最科学、最精辟的论述。毛主席非常明确地告诉我们，绝不允许把民主和集中割裂开来，它是民主的，又是集中的，民主和集中之间，并没有不可越过的深沟。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫，却硬要把民主和集中割裂开来，胡说什么“党的领导人和上级机关应多注意民主；党的被领导者和下级机关应当多服从。”这完全是骗人的鬼话，这是有意制造混乱。我们知道，无产阶级的民主集中制，要求党的各级领导，必须在广泛民主的基础上，集中群众的正确意见；广大党员群众，又必须在集中指导下，充分运用民主权利，关心党的事业，“敢于和善于提出问题、发表意见、批评缺点，以及对于领导机关和领导干部从爱护观点出发的监督作用。”中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么上级“多注意民主”，下级“多服从”的无耻谰言，说穿了，就是借民主之名，行独裁之实，假民主，真独裁，从根本上歪曲和否定无产阶级的民主集中制。
    同志们认识到：无产阶级民主集中制，在党和国家的政治生活中，具有重大意义。自觉地、认真地、严格地按照民主集中制的原则办事，是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线，忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的一个重要标志，是无产阶级坚强党性的表现。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，坚持贯彻民主集中制，不可避免地要遇到来自右的和极“左”方面的破坏和干扰。对此，我们要保持高度的警惕性。在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，反动的无政府主义和资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，是贯彻执行民主集中制的大敌。大家强调指出：阶级敌人必然要利用资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义来破坏无产阶级文化大革命，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，对抗以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。我们无产阶级革命派，为了夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，就必须同反动的无政府主义思潮和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作坚决的斗争。
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，是反动的资产阶级世界观的表现。它的核心就是一个“私”字。
    同志们一致表示：要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加努力活学活用毛泽东思想，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在灵魂深处爆发革命，不断改造世界观，促进思想革命化，保证毛主席最新指示条条落实，全面落实，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军中立新功！
