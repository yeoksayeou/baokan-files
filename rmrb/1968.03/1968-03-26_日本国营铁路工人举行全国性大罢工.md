Japanese national railway workers in Tokyo, Mito, Kumamoto, Kagoshima, and 55 other locations across the country went on a nationwide strike from 4 AM to 8 AM on the 23rd. They protested against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and the Sato government's attempt to lay off a large number of railway workers. This is the second major strike by Japanese national railway workers following the one on March 2nd. Due to the suspension of numerous trains, many railway services were paralyzed.

During the strike, railway workers in various locations held meetings and demonstrations.

    日本国营铁路工人举行全国性大罢工
    日本东京、水户、熊本、鹿儿岛等全国五十八个地方的国营铁路工人，二十三日从早晨四点到八点举行了全国性大罢工，抗议美帝国主义侵略越南和佐藤政府企图大批解雇铁路工人的罪行。这是日本国营铁路工人继三月二日罢工之后的又一次大规模罢工。由于大批列车停运，许多铁路瘫痪。
    罢工期间，各地铁路工人纷纷集会示威。
