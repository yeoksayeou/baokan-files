    美帝国主义及其老挝走狗在巴提地区安置了一个“特种部队”营地，经常对以上三个省的解放区进行骚扰和空袭。桑怒省的爱国武装力量为了保卫解放区，从今年一月份开始向巴提地区的敌人发动了猛烈进攻。在一月十九日到二十一日的三天中，爱国武装力量攻克了在芒猪、猪发、宗德、巴杭、法欣会、冯西、俊班和富贡的敌人哨所，打死敌军数百名。
    在二月份，地方武装部队和游击队收缩了对巴提的敌人的主要据点的包围，并不断截击敌人的空中供应。
    三月十一日，爱国武装力量在当地人民的有力支援下向敌人在巴提地区的最后一个据点发动了猛烈攻击，完全解放了这个地区和数以千计的人民。目前，爱国武装力量正在追歼逃入附近丛林中的残敌。
    新华社康开十七日电据巴特寮通讯社报道：英勇善战的老挝沙拉湾省爱国军民二月二十三日和二十五日以强大的攻势，猛烈进攻敌人，取得了歼敌三百多名的巨大胜利。
