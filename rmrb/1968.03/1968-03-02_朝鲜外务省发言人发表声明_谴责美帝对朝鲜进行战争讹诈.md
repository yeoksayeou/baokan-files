The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on February 27, condemning the war blackmail by U.S. imperialism against Korea.

The statement said that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique are currently making frenzied war threats against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Recently, the U.S. imperialists have established a special task force, the Third Special Task Force, and deployed it in the waters near the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They have strengthened their bases in South Korea with hundreds of fighter-bombers, threatening and blackmailing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They have issued an emergency mobilization order to the U.S. invasion forces occupying South Korea and the South Korean puppet army, and have been continuously conducting military provocations on land, sea, and air.

At the same time, the U.S. imperialists have strengthened the equipment of the puppet army, providing the South Korean puppet clique with military "aid" worth one hundred million dollars. They have also instructed the South Korean puppet clique to request the sixteen countries that participated in the U.S. imperialist invasion of Korea to immediately join the war if they launch a new one, and have sent letters requesting assistance to Japan and the Kuomintang bandits.

The statement said: On February 23, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk labeled the People's Army's Navy's lawful self-defense measure of capturing the armed spy ship "Pueblo" and the armed guerrilla activities of the South Korean people as "provocations by North Korea."

The statement pointed out that no matter how the U.S. warmongers and their lackeys use their bandit logic to distort right and wrong, they cannot conceal their aggressive nature or deceive world public opinion.

The statement said: "The U.S. imperialists are trying to use the capture of the armed spy ship 'Pueblo' as an excuse to launch a war. From the fact that the U.S. imperialists have no sincerity in the talks at Panmunjom regarding this incident and insist on their unjust positions, creating obstacles for the talks, it can be clearly seen."

In discussing the armed guerrilla activities of the South Korean people, which the U.S. imperialists and the Park Chung-hee clique are shouting about, the statement pointed out that this is a necessary phenomenon caused by the fascist rule of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys. Today, the armed guerrilla struggle in South Korea is a revolutionary patriotic struggle of the South Korean people, who can no longer tolerate the brutal fascist terror rule of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, and have taken up arms.

The statement pointed out that if the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique finally launch an aggressive war, the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are fully prepared to fight an anti-aggression war. The statement demands that U.S. imperialism immediately stop its piratical military threats and blackmail, as well as its hostile provocations against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and immediately withdraw its invasion forces and weapons from South Korea.

    朝鲜外务省发言人发表声明
    谴责美帝对朝鲜进行战争讹诈
    新华社一日讯　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省的一位发言人在二月二十七日发表声明，谴责美帝国主义对朝鲜进行战争讹诈。
    声明说，美帝国主义者和南朝鲜傀儡集团目前正在对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发出疯狂的战争叫嚣。
    美帝国主义者最近竟建立了一支特混舰队，叫第三特混部队，把它部署在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国附近的海面，以几百架战斗轰炸机加强了在南朝鲜的基地，对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行威胁和讹诈，向占领南朝鲜的美帝国主义侵略军和南朝鲜傀儡军发布了一项紧急动员令，并且正在不断地在陆地上、海上和空中进行军事挑衅。
    与此同时，美帝国主义者加强了傀儡军的装备，向南朝鲜傀儡集团增拨了价值一亿美元的军事“援助”，还指使南朝鲜傀儡集团请求过去参与美帝国主义侵朝战争的十六个国家，在他们一旦发动新的战争时立即参战，并向日本和蒋介石匪帮发出请求援助的信件。
    声明说：二月二十三日，美国国务卿腊斯克还把我们的人民军海军采取俘获“普韦布洛号”武装间谍船的正当的自卫措施和南朝鲜人民爱国的武装游击活动说成是“北朝鲜的挑衅”。
    声明指出，美国战争狂人及其走狗不管怎样使用颠倒黑白的强盗逻辑都不能掩盖其侵略本性，也欺骗不了世界公众舆论。
    声明说：“美帝国主义者力图利用武装间谍船‘普韦布洛号’被俘获的事件寻找发动一场战争的借口，从美帝国主义者对板门店有关这次事件的会谈没有任何诚意，并且坚持其非正义立场，给会谈制造障碍的事实，也可以清楚地看出。”
    声明在谈到美帝国主义者和朴正熙集团正在大叫大嚷的南朝鲜人民的武装游击队的活动时指出，这是美帝国主义者及其走狗的法西斯统治所造成的必然现象。今天在南朝鲜进行的武装游击斗争是南朝鲜人民一次革命的爱国斗争，他们再也不能忍受美帝国主义及其走狗残暴的法西斯恐怖统治，拿起了武器。
    声明指出，如果美帝国主义和南朝鲜的傀儡集团终于发动了侵略战争，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民充分准备进行反侵略战争。声明要求美帝国主义立即停止强盗式的军事威胁和讹诈以及对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的敌意挑衅，立即带着他们的侵略部队和武器撤出南朝鲜。
