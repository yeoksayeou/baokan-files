Political Discrimination, Economic Exploitation, and Ideological Poisoning
Soviet Women Workers Suffer Heavy Oppression Under the Rule of the Soviet Revisionist Clique

	MOSCOW, March 10 (Xinhua) — Under the rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, many Soviet women workers have lost their political rights, cannot find jobs, and face hardships in life. Even those who are lucky enough to have jobs are cruelly oppressed and exploited by the privileged class.

	Since the Soviet revisionist clique implemented the "new economic system" centered on the principle of profit in Soviet industrial and commercial enterprises, enterprise leaders have the power to arbitrarily hire, fire, and punish workers. As a result, many workers, especially women, have become the main targets of layoffs. According to Soviet publications, out of 83,000 women of working age in the mining town of Prokopievsk in the Kemerovo region, 33,000 have been laid off over the years. It is estimated that about 90,000 women in this region are unemployed.

	The working conditions for women workers are extremely poor. According to a female worker, V. I. Altamoshkina, from the Drezna Textile Mill in Moscow, "The machines often break down, and there is little lighting. Even when there is, it is dim, so the eyes quickly get tired." She also said that their looms often malfunction. "We start work at 5:30 AM, checking the cloth on the looms before starting the machines 20 minutes before the shift starts. After half an hour, one machine stops, producing defective goods. When this machine starts again, another stops, and then another. During a shift, the total downtime for the machines is six hours, which means that in a set of ten looms, one machine is almost always down for the entire shift."

	Many women workers have no political rights and are merely laboring under the slavery of the privileged class. Young women workers at a road construction machine station complained that they work outdoors all year round, enduring severe cold and heat, wind, and rain. Even if they have something to shield them from the sun, they are usually so tired that they are covered in sweat. The leaders specifically assign them the heaviest tasks: lifting, road construction, etc., and can freely insult and humiliate them.

	More seriously, some store managers embezzle and steal public funds and then frame others, persecuting female saleswomen. According to reports, female saleswomen in fruit and vegetable shops and food stores often discover shortages, so they have to use their own wages or their fathers' income to make up the deficit. Later, they found out that these bad deeds were "easily" done by the store managers.

	At the same time, the Soviet revisionist clique is desperately poisoning the minds of women. In recent years, Soviet newspapers have shamelessly advocated using "feminine charm" to "enliven life." In addition, they talk a lot about clothing. Some large cities in the Soviet Union often hold seasonal fashion shows, with fashion models performing on stage. In addition to professional models, female university students are also ordered to participate. Female students from a drama academy in the Soviet Union not only perform as models in various cities in the Soviet Union to showcase fashion, but also go to other countries to showcase it.

	Soviet publications also publish a large number of articles advocating bourgeois worldviews and lifestyles, advocating love above all, low-level vulgarity, guiding young women to pursue eating, drinking, and entertainment, discussing "new hairstyles," and engaging in "beauty treatments," pursuing money, cars, finding husbands who earn more, and living a comfortable life, thereby corrupting the will of young women. Some women who are deeply poisoned even become corrupt and idle, spending the whole day mixing with foreign sailors and indulging in the decadent life of the West.

	Soviet women will not endure the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Soviet revisionist clique for long. One day, they will rise up and smash the shackles imposed on them by the Soviet revisionist clique, achieving true liberation.

### 政治受歧视　经济受剥削　思想受毒化　苏联劳动妇女在苏修集团统治下遭受重重压迫

　　政治受歧视　经济受剥削　思想受毒化
　　苏联劳动妇女在苏修集团统治下遭受重重压迫
    新华社十日讯　莫斯科消息：在苏修领导集团统治下，许多苏联劳动妇女失去政治权利，找不到工作，生活困难；即令侥幸有工作的，也受着特权阶层残酷的压迫和剥削。
    自从苏修领导集团在苏联工矿企业和商业中推行以利润原则为核心的“经济新体制”后，企业领导人有权擅自招收、解雇和处罚工人。于是，许多工人，特别是妇女便成了解雇的主要对象。据苏联报刊透露，在基米罗伏州的矿工城普罗科皮耶夫斯克的八万三千个有劳动能力的妇女中，几年内，就有三万三千个妇女被先后解雇。据估计，这个州大约有九万妇女失业。
    女工们工作条件也极端恶劣。据莫斯科州德列兹纳纺织厂女工瓦·伊·阿尔塔莫什金娜揭露，她上班后，“机器常常停工，灯很少，即使有，也是半明半暗，因此眼睛很快就疲倦了。”她还说，她们的织机常常出故障。“清晨五点半就到工作地点了。查看了织机上的布，在上班前二十分钟就开机了。过了半小时，有一架停了，出了废品。当这架开了后，另一架又停了，随后又是一架。一班时间内，停机总时数达六个小时，这等于在十架织机中有一架几乎整班都停机”。
    许多女工毫无政治权利，只是在特权阶层的奴役下劳动着。在一个修路机械站工作的青年女工们抱怨说，她们终年在露天下工作，经受着严寒酷暑，风吹雨淋，即使有了“遮太阳的东西”，通常也是累得满头大汗。领导上专叫她们干“最重的活：起重、修路……”，而且可以随便谩骂和侮辱她们。
    更严重的是一些商店经理贪污盗窃公款后，却嫁祸于人，对女售货员进行迫害。据报道，一些在水果蔬菜门市部和食品商店工作的女售货员，经常发现短款，于是，她们不得不用自己的工资或父亲的收入来弥补缺款。后来她们才发现这些坏事都是商店领导人“常常很不费力地”干的。
    与此同时，苏修领导集团还在思想上拚命毒化妇女。近年来，苏修报纸公然无耻地鼓吹用“女性魔力”来“点缀生活”。此外，还大谈穿戴衣着。苏联一些大城市经常举办季节性的所谓时髦服装展览，并由时装模特儿登台表演。参加表演的除了职业性的模特儿以外，还命令女大学生参加。苏联一戏剧学院的女学生不仅在苏联各城市当模特儿展出时装，而且还到其他国家去展出。
    苏修报刊还大量刊登宣扬资产阶级世界观和资产阶级生活方式，宣扬爱情至上、低级庸俗的文章，引导青年妇女追求吃喝玩乐、谈论“新式发型”，大搞“美容”，追求金钱、汽车，寻找挣钱多的丈夫，过舒适的生活，以此来腐蚀青年妇女的意志。有些中毒很深的妇女甚至腐化堕落，不务正业，整天和外国水手鬼混，迷恋西方的糜烂生活。
    苏联妇女决不会长期忍受苏修领导集团对她们的残酷压迫和剥削。终有一天，她们会奋起砸碎苏修集团强加在她们身上的枷锁，获得真正的解放。
