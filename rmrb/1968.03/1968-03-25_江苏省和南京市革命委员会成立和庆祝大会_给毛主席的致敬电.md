Most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao:

"Spring breeze and willows a thousand strands, six hundred million people all become sage emperors."

Today, the proletarian revolutionary power of the gateway to the Yangtze River, the Jiangsu Province and Nanjing Municipal Revolutionary Committees, have been gloriously born!

From the plains of northern Jiangsu to the water towns of southern Jiangsu, the red flags are like the sea and the people are like the tide. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Where is there not joyous shouting? Where is there not singing with all one's heart? Shouting for the great victory of your latest directives! Singing for the outstanding achievements of the People's Liberation Army's "three supports, two militaries" work under your personal leadership! Millions of people send their most beautiful wishes from the bottom of their hearts: Long live, long live, long live the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! On this grand occasion, the four thousand seven hundred million heroic sons and daughters of yours fighting on the frontlines of the Yellow Sea think of you even more deeply, our benefactor, our savior!

"Long night difficult to illuminate the red dust of the world." In the dark old society, the three great mountains weighed heavily upon our heads for so many years! Old Nanjing was the lair of the Kuomintang reactionaries, demons danced and ghosts roamed. The Qinhuai River, how much filth and mud it accumulated; the Yangtze River, how much blood and tears of the suffering people it held!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The bitter and deep-hating people of Jiangsu, following you, fought revolution fearlessly and sought liberation at the cost of their lives.

The sparks of the Jinggangshan fire illuminated the path of armed struggle for the people of Jiangsu!

The unquenchable light of the Yan'an cave dwellings guided our direction of victory!

Countless revolutionary martyrs loyal to you wrote immortal poems with their blood! The singing of the "Internationale" at the foot of the Rainflower Terrace will forever inspire us to remember your teachings: Never forget class struggle.

"Winds and rains rise over Mount Zhong, a million heroes cross the Yangtze." A million heroes, sweeping away mountains and overturning seas! The thousand-mile river surface, sails like clouds! At this crucial moment of the Chinese revolution, Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It was your call to "carry the revolution through to the end" that shattered the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk to abort the revolution halfway; it was your command to "march on all over China" that overthrew the three great mountains oppressing the Chinese people and broke through the eastern front of imperialism! "The tiger crouches and the dragon coils, today it is better than ever before, the world is upside down and the times are stirring." Beloved Chairman Mao, the liberated people of Jiangsu, under your guidance, have embarked on the path of socialism! In the high tide of agricultural cooperation, you foresaw from a village in Kunshan County that "the masses harbor a great socialist enthusiasm," exposing the opportunist face of the Chinese Khrushchev. The heroic sons and daughters of Jiangsu, holding high the great red banner of your brilliant thoughts, built the magnificent edifice of socialism.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You personally ignited the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, your big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" like the million heroes crossing the Yangtze, smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and opened a new era in the international communist movement!

Beloved Chairman Mao! Following your teachings of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," along the revolutionary course you indicated, the heroic sons and daughters of Jiangsu launched the "people's war" of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

"In June, the heavenly soldiers march to exterminate evil, ten thousand zhang of rope to bind the rocs." The revolutionary masses of Jiangsu, hand in hand, heart to heart, "sweeping away a thousand troops like rolling up a mat," defeated the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangsu, Jiang Yiqing, Chen Guang, and a handful of capitalist roaders, making them fall like flowers in the wind.

Beloved Chairman Mao! You taught us: "All reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." The January Revolution storm in Shanghai swept across the country, a handful of capitalist roaders and Taozhi-style careerists within the Jiangsu Party launched a frenzied counterattack against the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. "Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." At this decisive moment, it was your series of latest directives that dispelled layer upon layer of mist and withstood gust after gust of evil wind. Your call to "support the army and love the people" made us unite and fight with our beloved People's Liberation Army, shattering the enemy's evil plot to destroy our Great Wall! Your affectionate teachings that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest" made us see through the enemy's malicious schemes to create divisions and incite armed struggles! Your great program of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" guided us to oppose bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and cut off the black hands. Under the call of the proletarian headquarters led by you, the working class of Jiangsu has united! All revolutionary masses of the proletariat have united!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Looking back on this arduous and glorious journey, which decision was not made by you personally? Which battle was not commanded by you personally? Which crucial moment was not indicated by you? Which victory does not shine with your great thoughts!

Beloved Chairman Mao, you said: Revolutionary committees are good. Revolutionary committees are indeed good! The Jiangsu Province and Nanjing Municipal Revolutionary Committees nurtured by you personally will definitely defend your brilliant thoughts and carry out your revolutionary line! We will definitely remember your teachings, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and swear with our blood and lives to defend the proletarian revolutionary power that is forever loyal to you.

Beloved Chairman Mao, your brilliant thoughts guide our direction of advance! We will use your thoughts to command everything, highlight proletarian politics, and achieve the revolutionization of people's thinking. We will definitely take Comrade Lin Biao as our shining example and be forever loyal to you! We will let Mao Zedong Thought study classes bloom everywhere, let the revolutionary academic style you personally advocated flourish greatly, "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism"! Let the Jiangsu Province and Nanjing Municipal Revolutionary Committees forever be in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat who are infinitely loyal to you, let the proletarian mountains remain forever red!

Most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, the full implementation of your latest directives is the full victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. We pledge to you: We will definitely respond more enthusiastically to your great call of "support the army and love the people," build an iron Great Wall on the frontlines of the Yellow Sea in our motherland; we will definitely carry out thorough criticism and repudiation of the revolution, thoroughly eliminate all the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk and their agents in Jiangsu, Jiang Yiqing, Chen Guang, and others, consolidate and develop the great alliance of the revolution and the three-in-one combination; rectify the Party organization and strengthen Party building; "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, promote preparedness," further economize on revolution. We will definitely follow your great strategic deployment, carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The sons and daughters of Jiangsu who are forever loyal to you wish you from the bottom of their hearts, our red sun in our hearts, long live, long live, long live!

    江苏省和南京市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
    给毛主席的致敬电
    最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    “春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。”
    今天，长江门户的无产阶级革命政权江苏省和南京市革命委员会，光荣地诞生了！
    从苏北平原，到江南水乡，红旗似海人如潮。毛主席啊，毛主席！哪里不在尽情地欢呼，哪里不在纵情地歌唱，欢呼您最新指示的伟大胜利！歌唱您亲手缔造的中国人民解放军“三支”
  “两军”工作的卓越功勋！千百万人民从心坎里发出最美好的祝愿：敬祝您老人家，我们心中最红最红的红太阳万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在这盛大的节日里，战斗在黄海前哨的您的四千七百万英雄儿女，更加深深地想念您啊，我们的恩人，我们的救星！
   “长夜难明赤县天”。在那黑暗的旧社会，三座大山压在我们头上多少年啊！旧南京是国民党反动派的老巢，群魔乱舞，鬼蜮成灾。秦淮河，积淀了多少污泥和浊水；扬子江，饱含了多少劳苦人民的血泪和仇恨！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！苦大仇深的江苏儿女，跟着您，前仆后继闹革命，出生入死求解放。
    井冈山的星星之火，照亮了江苏人民武装斗争的道路！
    延安窑洞不灭的灯光，指引着我们的胜利方向！
    多少无限忠于您的革命先烈，用鲜血写下了不朽的诗章！雨花台下的《国际歌》声啊，永远激励我们牢记您的教导：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。
    “钟山风雨起苍黄，百万雄师过大江。”百万雄师，排山倒海！千里江面，战帆如云！在这中国革命的关键时刻，毛主席啊，毛主席！正是您“将革命进行到底”的伟大号召，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫之流妄图使革命半途而废的罪恶阴谋；正是您“向全国进军”的伟大命令，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，冲破了帝国主义的东方战线！“虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”敬爱的毛主席，解放了的江苏人民，在您的指引下，踏上了社会主义的征途！在农业合作化的高潮中，您高瞻远瞩，从昆山县一个乡，看到“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性”，戳穿了中国赫鲁晓夫的机会主义嘴脸。英雄的江苏儿女，高举您光辉思想的伟大红旗，建设起社会主义的宏伟大厦。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您亲自点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，您《炮打司令部》的大字报，象当年百万雄师过大江，轰垮了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，开创了国际共产主义运动的新纪元！
    敬爱的毛主席！遵循您“对反动派造反有理”的教导，沿着您所指引的革命航向，英雄的江苏儿女，打响了在无产阶级专政下继续革命的
   “人民战争”。
   “六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”江苏省的无产阶级革命派手挽手，心连心，“横扫千军如卷席”，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江苏的代理人江渭清、陈光等一小撮走资派，打得落花流水。
    敬爱的毛主席！您教导我们：“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。上海“一月革命”的风暴席卷全国，江苏党内一小撮走资派和陶铸式的个人野心家，向无产阶级革命派疯狂反扑。“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”在这决定胜负的关头，是您一系列最新指示，拨开了层层迷雾，顶住了阵阵妖风。您“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，使我们和亲人解放军团结战斗，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图毁我长城的罪恶阴谋！您“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”的亲切教导，使我们识破了阶级敌人制造分裂、挑起武斗的恶毒鬼计！您“要斗私，批修”的伟大纲领，指导我们反对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，斩断黑手。在以您为首的无产阶级司令部的号召下，江苏工人阶级联合起来了！一切无产阶级革命派联合起来了！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！回顾这艰难而伟大的历程，那一个决策不是您亲自制定，那一个战役不是您亲自指挥，那一个关键时刻不是您指明方向，那一个胜利不闪耀着您伟大思想的光辉！
    敬爱的毛主席，您说：革命委员会好。革命委员会就是好！您亲手培育的江苏省和南京市革命委员会，一定要捍卫您的光辉思想，执行您的革命路线！我们一定牢记您的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，誓用鲜血和生命捍卫永远忠于您的无产阶级革命政权。
    敬爱的毛主席，您的光辉思想，指引着我们前进的方向！我们要用您的思想统帅一切，突出无产阶级政治，实现人的思想革命化。我们一定以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于您！我们要让毛泽东思想学习班遍地开花，让您亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风大大发扬，“斗私，批修”！让江苏省和南京市革命委员会永远掌握在无限忠于您的无产阶级革命派手中，让无产阶级江山千秋万代永远保持鲜红鲜红的颜色！
    最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，您最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。我们向您保证：我们一定更加热烈地响应您“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，在祖国黄海前哨筑起钢铁长城；我们一定要深入开展革命的大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其在江苏省的代理人江渭清、陈光等散布的一切流毒，巩固、发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合；整顿党的组织，加强党的建设；“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”，进一步节约闹革命。我们一定紧跟您的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！永远忠于您的江苏儿女，最最衷心地祝愿您啊，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    江苏省暨南京市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
                    一九六八年三月二十三日
