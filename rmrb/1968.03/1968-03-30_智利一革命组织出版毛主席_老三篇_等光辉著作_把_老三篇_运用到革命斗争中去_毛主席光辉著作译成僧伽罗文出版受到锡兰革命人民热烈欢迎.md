Edition: 5

A revolutionary organization in Chile has recently published three brilliant works by the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao: "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains."

In the preface to this book, the publisher points out: "We believe that we must seriously study the content of these three articles and creatively apply them to our revolutionary struggle. Since the problems raised in these three articles are always valid, this will help in forging revolutionary, resolute, brave, and principled fighters and loyal servants of the people who are prepared to make the greatest sacrifices and never consider themselves."

The preface states that such people are now growing under the banner of revolution.

In addition to the full texts of the "Three Articles," this book also includes several sections from the Little Red Book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," such as "Serve the People," "Patriotism and Internationalism," "Self-reliance and Hard Struggle," and "Communist Party Members."

To help the broad revolutionary masses in Chile understand Chairman Mao's works, the publisher has also reprinted editorials and articles from Beijing's "People's Daily," "Red Flag" magazine, and the "Liberation Army Daily" on studying these three articles.

The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, has many brilliant works, including "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," which have recently been translated into Sinhala and published as separate volumes by the "Labor News" of the Communist Party of Ceylon.

The single-volume works translated into Sinhala include: "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Why Can the Red Political Power in China Exist?," "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," "The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War," and "The Problem of Independence and Initiative in the United Front."

The progressive Sinhala weekly "Path" recently published Chairman Mao's brilliant essay "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?"

The Sinhala editions of these brilliant works by Chairman Mao have been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary people of Ceylon.
