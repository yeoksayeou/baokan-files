	Thai People Protest Against U.S. Imperialist Soldiers' Brutality Toward Thai Women

	Under the protection and encouragement of the traitorous Thanom-Praphat regime, U.S. aggressor troops stationed in Thailand have been running amok, killing Thai civilians at will, which has aroused great indignation among the Thai people.

	According to Thai newspapers, recently, near the U.S. military base in Nakhon Sawan's Takhli, another innocent Thai woman was brutally murdered by U.S. soldiers.

	It is also reported that not long ago, near the Takhli U.S. military base, several bodies of Thai girls who were raped and killed by U.S. soldiers were found.

	In recent days, Thai public opinion has been widely condemning these atrocities committed by U.S. imperialism.

	Ecuadorian People Oppose U.S. Imperialist Plunder of Resources

	The U.S. imperialists' intensified plundering of Ecuador's forest resources has met with strong opposition from the broad masses of the Ecuadorian people.

	The U.S. timber monopoly, Georgia-Pacific Plywood Company, with the tacit approval of the Ecuadorian government, seized the lease rights to 800,000 hectares of forest land in the northwestern Esmeraldas province in February this year, ruthlessly plundering the rich virgin forest resources in the region.

	The broad masses of people in Esmeraldas province are extremely indignant at this plundering act by U.S. imperialism and have recently held meetings to strongly condemn U.S. imperialism's banditry that violates Ecuador's territorial integrity.

	U.S. Government Distributes Drugs to Boost Morale of U.S. Troops in Vietnam

	Since the New Year, U.S. aggressor troops in Vietnam have suffered heavy blows from the military and people of South Vietnam, leading to widespread demoralization, panic, and low morale.

	Faced with this serious situation, the Johnson administration, in addition to using some minor favors to "boost morale," has been distributing large quantities of drugs among U.S. troops in Vietnam to encourage drug use. Recently returned soldiers from South Vietnam have complained, "The government is poisoning us with drugs." They say that currently, the morale of U.S. troops in South Vietnam is very low, with a high number of desertions. Officers "know the soldiers are afraid and have to get something to calm their nerves," so they "supply drugs throughout the battlefield." Some have revealed that officers often distribute marijuana leaves or "stimulant pills" before the troops go into battle to "make them better fighting machines."

    泰国人民抗议美帝兽兵残害泰妇女
    在美帝走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团包庇纵容下，驻在泰国的美国侵略军横行霸道，任意凶杀泰国居民，激起泰国人民极大的愤慨。
    据泰国报纸报道，最近，在那空沙旺府打卡里美军基地附近，又有一名无辜的泰国妇女惨遭美国兽兵的杀害。
    另据报道，不久前，在打卡里美军基地附近，曾经发现过好几具被美国兽兵奸杀的泰国少女的尸体。
    连日来，泰国公众舆论纷纷声讨美帝国主义的这些暴行。
    厄瓜多尔人民反对美帝掠夺资源
    美帝国主义加紧大肆掠夺厄瓜多尔森林资源的强盗行径，遭到了厄瓜多尔广大人民的强烈反对。
    美国木材垄断企业乔治亚—太平洋胶合板公司在厄瓜多尔政府的默许下，今年二月间攫取了厄瓜多尔西北部埃斯梅拉尔达斯省森林区的八十万公顷土地的租让权，大肆掠夺这个地区丰富的原始森林资源。
    埃斯梅拉尔达斯省的广大人民对美帝国主义这一掠夺行为感到无比的愤慨，最近纷纷举行集会，强烈谴责美帝国主义侵犯厄瓜多尔领土完整的强盗行径。
    美国政府散发毒品给侵越美军打气
    新春以来，美国侵略军由于连续遭到越南南方军民的沉重打击，军心涣散，恐慌万状，士气极为低落。
    面临着这种严重的情况，约翰逊政府除了采用一些小恩小惠措施来“鼓舞士气”之外，还在侵越美军中大量散发毒品，鼓励吸毒。新近从南越服役期满回国的士兵们抱怨，“（美国）政府正在用毒品毒害我们当兵的。”他们说，目前在南越的美军士气很低，“开小差的人数极多”，军官们“知道士兵们害怕，不得不弄点什么东西来镇静他们的神经”，于是“在整个战场大量供应毒品”。有的人还透露，军官们往往“在部队投入战斗前”散发大麻叶或者“刺激性药丸”之类的“提神药品”，以便“使他们成为一架更好的作战机器”。
