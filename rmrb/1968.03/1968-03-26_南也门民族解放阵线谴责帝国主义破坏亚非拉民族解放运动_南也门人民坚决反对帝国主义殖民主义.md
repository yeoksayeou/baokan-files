The National Liberation Front of South Yemen recently issued a resolution from a meeting, exposing and denouncing the crimes of imperialism and colonialism in sabotaging national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The fourth meeting of the National Liberation Front was held from March 2 to 8 in the coastal town of Zinjibar, northeast of Aden. The resolution stipulates that the Central Command of the National Liberation Front, consisting of 41 elected members, is temporarily considered the highest authority of the People's Republic of South Yemen.

The resolution points out that South Yemen must break free from the economic control of foreign capital, liberate national capital from foreign control and exploitation, and transform the national economy from a consumer economy to an industrial production economy.

The resolution decides to quickly purge traitors and counter-revolutionaries from the government's administrative departments and military organs.

The resolution also decides to implement land reform and carry out literacy campaigns in rural and urban areas.

The resolution states that since South Yemen is an indivisible part of the Arab world, it is South Yemen's fundamental duty to support the national liberation movements in the Arabian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula fighting against imperialism, colonialism, and reactionaries, and to play an active role. The resolution reaffirms support for the armed struggle of the Palestinian people and condemns imperialism's aggressive war against the heroic Vietnamese people.

The Central Command of the National Liberation Front also issued a political statement. The statement points out: Colonialism is changing and developing its policies towards newly independent countries, binding them politically and economically to the wheels of neo-colonialism through military treaties and cultural exchanges. Imperialism attempts to sabotage these countries through plots or reactionary coups, deliberately creating regional conflicts to profit from them and consolidate their international monopolies.

The statement denounces imperialism and colonialism for waging wars, using force, and sabotaging national liberation movements in some regions of the world, such as Vietnam and Arab countries.

The statement says that in recent years, national liberation movements have swept across the Arab world. The broad masses of laborers are the true revolutionaries. The failure to withstand the military provocations of colonialist countries and Zionism on June 5, 1967, was because the national liberation movement, as a revolutionary means, did not rely on the Arab laboring masses.

The statement says that in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and Zionism, South Yemen is an indivisible part of the Arab nation. The statement expresses that South Yemen will not retreat in this struggle.

    新华社亚丁电　南也门民族解放阵线最近发表了一项会议决议，揭露和谴责帝国主义和殖民主义破坏亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族解放运动的罪行。
    南也门民族解放阵线第四次会议是从三月二日至八日在亚丁东北的沿海市镇津吉巴尔举行的。会议决议规定，由选举产生的四十一名成员组成的民族解放阵线总指挥部暂时被认为是南也门人民共和国的最高权力机构。
    决议指出，南也门必须在经济上摆脱外国资本的统治，使民族资本摆脱外国的控制和剥削，把国民经济从消费性经济改变为工业生产性经济。
    决议决定把走狗、反革命分子从政府的行政部门和军事机关中迅速地清洗出去。
    决议还决定实行土地改革，以及在农村和城市开展扫盲工作。
    决议指出，由于南也门是阿拉伯世界不可分割的一部分，因此支持阿拉伯湾和阿拉伯半岛为反对帝国主义、殖民主义和反动派而战斗的民族解放运动是南也门的根本义务，并要发挥积极作用。决议重申支持巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争，谴责帝国主义对英雄的越南人民发动的侵略战争。
    民族解放阵线总指挥部也发表了一项政治声明。声明指出：殖民主义对获得了独立的国家正在改变和发展它的政策，即通过军事条约和文化交流，从政治和经济上把它们绑在新殖民主义的车轮上。帝国主义企图通过对这些国家策划阴谋或制造反动政变从事破坏，并蓄意制造地区冲突，从中渔利，以巩固它们的国际垄断。
    声明谴责帝国主义和殖民主义在世界的一些地区如越南以及阿拉伯国家发动战争，使用武力，破坏民族解放运动。
    声明说，近年来，民族解放运动席卷阿拉伯世界。广大的劳动群众是真正的革命者。一九六七年六月五日没有顶住殖民主义国家和犹太复国主义的军事挑衅，是因为作为革命手段的民族解放运动，没有依靠阿拉伯劳动群众。
    声明说，在反对帝国主义、殖民主义和犹太复国主义的斗争中，南也门是阿拉伯民族的一个不可分割的部分。声明表示，在这场斗争中，南也门决不会退缩。
