African public opinion strongly condemns the atrocities of the Smith fascist colonial regime in Southern Rhodesia, which brutally murdered five Zimbabwean patriots.

The Tanzanian newspaper *Uhuru* stated: There should be no more illusions about the British Labour government. This newspaper called for active armed struggle against the Smith regime. It said: The crimes of the Smith regime must be punished.

The Secretariat of the Organization of African Unity issued a statement in Addis Ababa on March 7, expressing extreme outrage at this atrocity by the colonial authorities in Southern Rhodesia. The statement said that Africans will accept this challenge and defend their honor. It also reaffirmed that force is the only way to smash the Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia.

On March 6, Mauritania's Foreign Minister Mamadou Wane issued a statement saying: "The Mauritanian government strongly protests against this inhuman and barbaric act and will continue to provide steadfast support to the brotherly Zimbabwean people within the framework of the Organization of African Unity to strengthen the struggle for national liberation."

Zambia's Foreign Minister Kamanaga, in a speech to the parliament, expressed great shock and indignation at the atrocities of the Smith regime.

A responsible person from the Mozambican freedom fighters told a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Dar es Salaam: The recent killing of Zimbabwean freedom fighters by the Smith regime is a good negative example. For the African people, two lessons should be learned: "First, the African people should not harbor any illusions about British imperialism, which conspires with the Smith gangsters, nor should they have any hope for so-called condemnatory statements from organizations like the United Nations. Second, the only way to solve the Zimbabwe problem is for the Zimbabwean people to take up arms and wage a people's war."

Another Mozambican freedom fighter said that the killing of Zimbabwean freedom fighters is a bad thing, but as the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "Bad things can be turned into good things." This Mozambican freedom fighter continued, saying that the Smith regime cannot intimidate the Zimbabwean people but will only arouse the people's hatred towards the enemy and strengthen their determination to fight more bravely to achieve final victory.

The Mozambican freedom fighters in Dar es Salaam also issued a statement on March 14, calling on the people of the entire southern region of Africa to intensify various revolutionary actions to provide stronger support for their Zimbabwean brothers.

    据新华社讯　非洲公众舆论强烈谴责南罗得西亚史密斯法西斯殖民政权残酷杀害津巴布韦五名爱国者的暴行。
    坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》说：现在不应当再对英国工党政府抱什么幻想了。这家报纸号召进行积极的武装斗争来对付史密斯政权。它说：史密斯政权的罪行必须得到惩罚。
    非洲统一组织秘书处七日在亚的斯亚贝巴发表声明，对南罗得西亚殖民当局这一暴行表示极为愤怒。声明说，非洲人将接受这个挑战，维护他们的荣誉。它还重申，武力是粉碎南罗得西亚史密斯政权的唯一办法。
    毛里塔尼亚外交部长马马杜·瓦尼六日发表声明说：“毛里塔尼亚政府对这种惨无人道的野蛮行径提出最强烈的抗议，并且将继续在非洲统一组织范围内给予兄弟的津巴布韦人民以坚持不懈的支持，来加强争取民族解放的斗争。”
    赞比亚外交部长卡曼加在向议会发表的一篇谈话中，对史密斯政权的暴行表示极大的震惊和愤慨。
    莫三鼻给自由战士的一位负责人在达累斯萨拉姆对新华社记者说：最近史密斯政权杀害津巴布韦自由战士是很好的反面教材，对非洲人民来说应该吸取两个经验教训：“第一，非洲人民不能对同史密斯匪徒共谋的英帝国主义抱有任何幻想，也不能对象联合国之类的组织发表什么所谓谴责声明抱任何希望。第二，解决津巴布韦问题的唯一途径是津巴布韦人民拿起武器，进行人民战争。”
    另一位莫三鼻给自由战士说，津巴布韦自由战士被杀害是坏事，但是正如中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“坏事也可以转变成为好事。”这位莫三鼻给自由战士接着说，史密斯政权决不能吓倒津巴布韦人民，而只会激起津巴布韦人民对敌人的仇恨，增强他们更加勇敢地战斗去夺取最后胜利的决心。
    在达累斯萨拉姆的莫三鼻给自由战士十四日还发表一项声明，号召整个非洲南部地区的人民加紧采取各种革命行动，给津巴布韦兄弟以更有力的支持。
