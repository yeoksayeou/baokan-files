	Be a Model in Upholding Revolutionary Discipline
	Foundry Worker Shen Gusheng of the Casting Shop, Casting Plant

	Recently, due to the influence of anarchist thinking, some people in our shop, under the pretext of "self-education," have been slacking off at work and not observing labor discipline. As a result, the steel ingot molds have not been cleaned of floating sand in a timely manner, and the sand has accumulated, totaling over eighty molds, affecting the production of the steelmaking plant. Seeing this, we felt as if our hearts were being wrung by a knife.

	What should we do? After much discussion, we found that the only solution was to implement Chairman Mao's instructions. Through the study of Chairman Mao's works, we came to a deeper understanding that without observing unified revolutionary discipline, we cannot win the battle. The root cause of the failure to clean the steel ingot molds in a timely manner is the lack of observance of labor discipline. To describe the behavior of not observing labor discipline as "self-education" is the logic of lazy people who harm the public interest for personal gain and is an expression of disloyalty to Chairman Mao. This kind of thinking must be thoroughly corrected.

	"Strengthen discipline, and the revolution will be invincible." Because Chairman Mao's instructions were implemented, more people began to consciously observe labor discipline, and everyone's spirit changed. Some comrades came to the steel ingot mold cleaning site as soon as it was light, preparing tools such as punches, hammers, and wind shovels. As soon as everyone started work, they picked up their tools and worked enthusiastically. If the work was not completed during the day, they would work overnight. When they were tired, everyone would recite, "Promote the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous combat (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." As a result, in just a few days, they cleaned all eighty-plus steel ingot molds, making them "bald," and all were delivered to the steelmaking plant on time. Since then, our production has taken the initiative, and we have won victory after victory.

    做遵守革命纪律的模范
    铸管厂铸造车间清砂工人　沈古生
    前些时候，由于受无政府主义思潮的影响，我们车间有的人借口“自己教育自己”，工作遛遛达达，不遵守劳动纪律。结果，铸造用的钢锭模子，没能及时把浮砂清理掉，越积越多，共积了八十多个，影响炼钢厂生产。看到这些，咱们心里真是急的象刀绞的一样。
    怎么办呢？大伙找来找去，办法只有一条，就是落实毛主席的指示。通过毛主席著作的学习，更深刻地认识到，不遵守统一的革命纪律，就不能打胜仗。钢锭模没能及时清除浮砂，根本原因之一就是没有遵守劳动纪律。把不遵守劳动纪律的行为说成是“自己教育自己”，是损公利己的懒汉逻辑，是对毛主席不忠的表现。这种思想必须彻底纠正。
      “加强纪律性，革命无不胜。”由于毛主席指示得到了落实，自觉遵守劳动纪律的人多了起来，大家的精神面貌也变了。有的同志天刚蒙蒙亮就来到钢锭模清砂现场，准备钎子、铁锤、风铲等工具，大伙一上班就操起工具热气腾腾地干起来。白天干不完，晚间连夜突击。干累了，大伙就背诵“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”。结果，几天之内就把积存的八十多个钢锭模剃了“光秃”，全部及时运给了炼钢厂。从这以后，我们的生产取得了主动，接连打了胜仗。
