The military and civilian population of South Vietnam's Saigon have fought valiantly for half a month, turning the enemy's stronghold into a battlefield to strike the enemy. From January 31 to February 15, they achieved brilliant results, annihilating and dismantling nearly 22,000 enemy troops (including nearly 9,500 American invaders and mercenaries). They destroyed six enemy battalions (including one American battalion), 34 companies (including two American companies), and one armored vehicle regiment of the puppet army.

The military and civilian population of Saigon also destroyed 430 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, and 30 other military vehicles. They shot down and destroyed more than 200 enemy aircraft, blew up 35 ammunition depots, captured and forced the enemy to withdraw from more than 40 outposts and sentry posts near Saigon, blew up more than 20 bridges, and seized dozens of enemy fuel depots, food, and military supply warehouses. They also seized thousands of various weapons.

The report said that during the powerful Tet Offensive of the South Vietnamese military and civilian population, hundreds of thousands of people in Saigon rose up to fight alongside the People's Liberation Armed Forces, launching attacks on various headquarters and important bases of the American puppet group in Saigon. They fought the enemy to a standstill, causing them to collapse. From the puppet "Presidential Palace" of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky group to the American "Embassy," from the headquarters of Westmoreland to the puppet army general staff, marine corps headquarters, and the "Capital Special Zone" headquarters, from the puppet police headquarters to the police stations in various districts, as well as the Saigon Broadcasting Station and other American puppet ruling institutions, all were attacked or destroyed. The enemy was terrified and in a state of panic. Many of the enemy's large military bases were also attacked, suffering heavy losses. The New Mountain Airport alone was attacked dozens of times by the People's Liberation Armed Forces' infantry and artillery, destroying and shooting down hundreds of aircraft, causing this most important air base to be paralyzed multiple times. The water and land transportation lines around Saigon, including the Fourth, First, Thirteenth, and Fifteenth Roads, the Saigon-Bien Hoa Road, the Saigon River, and the Dong Nai River, were all cut off, putting the enemy in a very difficult situation.

The report said that, in particular, the military and civilian population north of Saigon closely coordinated with the military and civilian population inside the city to launch attacks on the bases of the U.S. First and Twenty-Fifth Infantry Divisions stationed in Go Vap, Dong Nai, and other places in Gia Dinh Province, as well as in O Long Vinh, Lai Thieu, Phu Loi, and Bien Hoa in Thu Duc Province. They annihilated thousands of American invaders, tying down the American mobile forces and preventing them from rushing to rescue the besieged American puppet headquarters and bases. Under the fierce, continuous, and widespread attacks of the military and civilian population of Saigon, the enemy's ruling institutions collapsed in large areas. Many outposts and sentry posts of the puppet army around Saigon rose up, handing over the outposts, sentry posts, and weapons to the people.

The report said that in the fifteen days of the Tet Offensive, the military and civilian population of Saigon launched attacks on the enemy's stronghold, achieving brilliant victories both militarily and politically. The military and civilian population of Saigon have already controlled many important areas around the important bases of the American puppet army, surrounding the enemy from all sides, tightly pinning down the American mobile forces north of Saigon, and dragging the puppet army's strategic reserve forces to Saigon. At the same time, this victory has rapidly and vigorously developed the revolutionary forces of the Saigon people, making it even more advantageous for the military and civilian population of South Vietnam to advance bravely and seize complete victory.

    把敌人老巢变成打击敌人的战场
    南越西贡军民奋战半月歼敌二万多
    歼美军和帮凶军九千多名，击毁坦克、装甲车四百三十多辆，击落击毁敌机二百多架
    新华社河内二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西贡市军民从一月三十一日到二月十五日的半个月内，猛捣美伪集团的老窠，取得了辉煌的战绩，共消灭和瓦解敌军近二万二千名（包括美国侵略军和帮凶军近九千五百名），歼灭和重创敌军六个营（其中美军一个营）、三十四个连（其中美军两个连）和伪军一个装甲车战团。
    西贡市军民还击毁敌人坦克、装甲车四百三十多辆和其他军车三十辆，击落击毁敌机二百多架，摧毁军火仓库三十五座，攻克和迫使敌人撤出西贡市附近的据点和哨所四十多座，炸毁桥梁二十多座，攻占了成十座敌人的汽油仓库、粮食和军用物资仓库，缴获数以千计的各种武器。
    报道说，在越南南方军民的强大新春攻势中，西贡市成百万人民奋起战斗，同人民解放武装力量一起，向西贡市美伪集团的各个首脑机关和重要基地发起进攻，把它们打得落花流水，处于瘫痪状态。从阮文绍—阮高其集团的伪“总统府”到美国“大使馆”，从威斯特摩兰的司令部到伪军总参谋部、海军陆战队司令部和“首都特区”司令部，从伪警察总署到各县的警察署以及西贡广播电台和其他美伪统治机构，全部遭到袭击或被摧毁。敌人被打得胆战心惊，恐慌万状。敌人的许多大型军事基地也遭到进攻，损失惨重。仅新山一机场就遭到人民解放武装力量的步兵和炮兵的成十次袭击，击毁击落飞机成百架，敌人的这个最重要的空军基地多次处于瘫痪。西贡周围的第四号、第一号、第十三号和第十五号公路，西贡—边和公路，芽?河和西贡河等水陆交通线也全部被切断，使敌人陷于极其困窘的处境。
    报道说，特别是西贡市北面军民，紧密配合市内军民的战斗，向驻在嘉定省古芝、东如，土龙木省的油汀、莱溪、富利、边葛，以及边和、龙城等地的美国第一和第二十五步兵师的各个基地发动进攻，消灭成千名美国侵略军，拖住了美军的机动力量，使它们无法前往救援遭到袭击的美伪首脑机关和基地。在西贡市军民的猛烈、连续和广泛的进攻之下，敌人的统治机构大片瓦解。西贡市四周敌人许多据点和哨所里的伪军爱国士兵纷纷起义，把据点、哨所和武器交给人民。
    报道说，西贡市军民在新春的十五天内，向敌人的这个老窠发动的进攻中，在军事上和政治上都取得了辉煌的胜利。西贡市军民已经控制了美伪军重要基地周围的许多重要区域，从四面八方围困敌人，把美军的机动力量紧紧地钳制在西贡北面，并把伪军的战略总后备力量拖在西贡。同时，这一胜利使西贡人民革命力量迅速、蓬勃发展，更加有利于越南南方军民奋勇向前，夺取彻底的胜利。
