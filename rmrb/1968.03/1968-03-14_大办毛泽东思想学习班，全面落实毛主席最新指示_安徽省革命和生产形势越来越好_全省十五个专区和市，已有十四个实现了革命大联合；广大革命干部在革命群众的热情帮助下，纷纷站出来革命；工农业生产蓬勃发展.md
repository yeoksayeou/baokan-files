The revolutionary and production situation in Anhui Province is getting better and better. Out of the 15 prefectures and cities in the province, 14 have already achieved great revolutionary unity. Under the enthusiastic help of revolutionary masses, a large number of revolutionary cadres have come forward to join the revolution. Industrial and agricultural production is thriving.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: The situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Anhui Province is unprecedentedly good and getting better. Currently, out of the 15 prefectures and cities in the province, 14 have already achieved great revolutionary unity. Places like Hefei, Huainan, Ma'anshan, and Fuyang, which achieved unity earlier, have further consolidated the revolutionary great unity in their minds through struggle and are now preparing to establish revolutionary committees. The two opposing revolutionary mass organizations in Wuhu City have recently also achieved revolutionary great unity, which will greatly promote the victorious development of the Cultural Revolution in the areas along the Yangtze River and in southern Anhui.

Since the beginning of the glorious year 1968, the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Anhui Province, with the help of the PLA's left-supporting troops, have launched a new high tide of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Everywhere, the focus is on setting up and running well Mao Zedong Thought study classes to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. According to incomplete statistics, the province has set up more than 57,000 study classes, with nearly 3 million people participating in the study. The broad masses of workers and peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, with deep class feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, eagerly participate in the study classes. In the study classes, they fiercely fight against selfishness and establish public-mindedness, launching a "people's war" to eradicate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Bengbu City held more than 1,300 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 90,000 revolutionary masses participating in the study. In the study classes, they seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles," using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to investigate manifestations of factionalism, list the crimes of factionalism, expose the harm of factionalism, and uproot the roots of factionalism. The leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations consciously examined their factionalism, exposed their private thoughts, and fought against them, clearing away the ideological obstacles for the city to achieve revolutionary great unity.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of one's own unit. This issue must be resolved." The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses follow Chairman Mao's teachings, actively helping revolutionary cadres to correctly handle relations with the masses and correctly handle themselves, deeply examine their mistakes, and bravely come forward to join the revolution. Revolutionary cadres also resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, go to the masses, humbly learn from the masses, listen to the masses' opinions, change their worldview, and gain the understanding of the masses. Now, from the province to various counties, a large number of revolutionary cadres have been liberated, creating conditions for achieving the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Since November last year, the revolutionary mass organizations and the broad revolutionary masses in various places in Anhui Province, especially those units that have achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, have further deepened the revolutionary criticism activities and combined the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Hefei area held consecutive meetings to expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui. The vast rural areas also criticized and denounced, resolutely purging all revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui. Through revolutionary criticism, the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines of the broad revolutionary masses have been further heightened.

The broad masses of workers and peasants have directed the revolutionary enthusiasm aroused in the Cultural Revolution into production, promoting the thriving development of industrial and agricultural production. Based on the great harvest of agriculture last year, the broad masses of community members are now busy preparing for farming and water conservancy projects, fertilizing wheat fields, and striving for an even better harvest this year. The industrial production of the whole province is also developing day by day.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the PLA stationed in Anhui, fighting on the front line of "three supports and two militaries," resolutely respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to arms, seriously implement the principle of "supporting the left but not the faction," and regard the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the fundamental task of "three supports and two militaries." They go deep into the masses, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, learn from the masses, and bring a series of good traditions such as emphasizing politics, adhering to the four firsts, carrying forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, and promoting democracy to the masses. With great enthusiasm, they arm the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, help the broad revolutionary masses further overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, making contributions to the early establishment of the revolutionary committee in Anhui Province.

　　大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席最新指示
　　安徽省革命和生产形势越来越好
    全省十五个专区和市，已有十四个实现了革命大联合；广大革命干部在革命群众的热情帮助下，纷纷站出来革命；工农业生产蓬勃发展
    新华社合肥电　安徽省无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，越来越好。目前，全省十五个专区和市，已有十四个实现了革命大联合。联合较早的合肥、淮南、马鞍山、阜阳等地，在斗争中进一步从思想上巩固了革命大联合，目前正在筹备建立革命委员会。芜湖市长期对立的两派革命群众组织，最近也实现了革命大联合，这对长江两岸和皖南地区文化大革命的胜利发展将起有力的促进作用。
    进入光辉的一九六八年以来，安徽省的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，广泛掀起了全面落实毛主席最新指示的新高潮。各地都把大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，作为全面落实毛主席最新指示的关键。据不完全统计，全省已办学习班五万七千多个，参加学习的近三百万人。广大工农群众、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，踊跃参加学习班学习。他们在学习班里，狠斗私字，大立公字，展开了一场围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”。蚌埠市举办了一千三百多个毛泽东思想学习班，有九万多革命群众参加学习。他们在学习班里认真学习毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，查派性的表现，列派性的罪状，诉派性的危害，挖派性的老根。两派革命群众组织的头头自觉地检查派性，亮私斗私，为全市实现革命大联合扫清了思想障碍。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众遵照毛主席这一教导，积极帮助革命干部正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，深刻地检查自己的错误，勇敢地站出来革命。广大革命干部也坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，到群众中去，虚心向群众学习，听取群众意见，改造自己的世界观，取得群众的谅解。现在，从省到各县已经解放出一大批革命干部，为实现革命三结合创造了条件。
    从去年十一月份以来，安徽省各地革命群众组织和广大革命群众，特别是已经实现革命大联合和革命三结合的单位，进一步深入地展开了革命大批判活动，并把革命大批判和本单位的斗、批、改结合起来。合肥地区无产阶级革命派连续召开大会，揭发和批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人的反革命修正主义罪行。广大农村也人人口诛笔伐，坚决肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人在农村散布的一切修正主义流毒。通过革命大批判，进一步提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    广大工农群众把在文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲用到生产中去，促进了工农业生产蓬勃发展。广大社员在去年农业获得大丰收的基础上，目前正在忙着备耕和兴修水利、给麦田追肥等农事活动，为夺取今年更好收成而奋斗。全省工业生产也正在日益发展。
    战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军驻安徽部队广大指战员，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的战斗号召，认真执行“支左不支派”的原则，把全面落实毛主席最新指示当作“三支”“两军”工作的根本。他们深入群众，相信群众，依靠群众，向群众学习，把突出政治、坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬民主等一系列好传统带给群众，满腔热情地用毛泽东思想武装革命群众，帮助广大革命群众进一步克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为安徽省早日成立革命委员会作出贡献。
