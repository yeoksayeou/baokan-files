	Vietnamese military and civilians in the South have been fighting vigorously since the New Year in the Mekong Delta, turning the tide in their favor. The U.S. puppet regime is increasingly losing control over this fertile region, known as the "rice bowl."

	Since January 30, military and civilian forces in the delta provinces have closely coordinated their efforts, launching a powerful offensive against the cities of My Tho, My Tho, My Tho, and many provincial capitals, counties, and enemy military bases and outposts. They have dealt the U.S. puppet regime a series of heavy blows. The U.S. and puppet forces stationed here have suffered heavy casualties, and many of their military and political headquarters in various cities and towns have been destroyed. Their plans to "pacify" the countryside have almost entirely failed in the sixteen delta provinces. More and more of the countryside has become the people's domain, with the red flag of victory flying everywhere.

	According to incomplete statistics, in the five provinces of My Tho, Go Cong, My Tho, Soai Rap, and Ba Ria, military and civilian forces destroyed and disbanded more than 15,300 U.S. and puppet troops from January 31 to February 29. This included the complete annihilation of eight enemy battalions, twelve companies, and the severe mauling of six battalions and dozens of companies. The main force of the puppet army's 7th Division, stationed in My Tho and Go Cong, was wiped out, with over 4,500 casualties.

	In addition, the military and civilian forces in these five provinces shot down, destroyed, or damaged more than 200 aircraft; destroyed or damaged more than 230 military vehicles; sank more than 20 ships; demolished several oil and ammunition depots; and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

	During this period, the military and civilian forces in these five provinces also destroyed, sabotaged, or forced the enemy to withdraw from more than 150 outposts and sentry posts, and demolished dozens of "strategic hamlets." In Soai Rap and Ba Ria, vast areas with more than 50,000 people were liberated.

	The military and civilian forces in Long An Province destroyed and disbanded more than 3,750 enemy troops in just half a month, from January 31 to February 14, and shot down or destroyed 79 aircraft.

	The U.S. mouthpiece, the Associated Press, admitted that the powerful offensive by the people's liberation forces has left the Mekong Delta in a state of "paralysis."

	A large part of the U.S. and puppet forces are bogged down in cities and counties, while the people's liberation forces can move freely in the countryside. Road transport has been disrupted and cut off, and most of the U.S. and puppet military outposts along the Mekong River have fallen. The desperate U.S. and puppet forces are filled with despair and anxiety.

	According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, military and civilian forces in the Central South Region have launched continuous, fierce attacks on the enemy, achieving brilliant results.

	According to preliminary statistics, in the nearly thirty days since January 30, military and civilian forces in the Central South Region have annihilated more than 12,000 enemy troops, including more than 2,500 U.S. invaders; destroyed four infantry battalions (including two U.S. battalions), one armored car regiment, two armored battalions, and twenty companies; destroyed and severely damaged the headquarters of the puppet army's 7th Infantry Division, three military sector "sweep" command posts, and the headquarters of two puppet army regiments; captured and demolished three puppet provincial headquarters, three provincial security force command posts, four puppet city halls, and many other puppet government institutions, and liberated many patriots imprisoned by the enemy.

	The entire region's military and civilian forces also shot down and destroyed forty U.S. aggressor aircraft, destroyed tanks, armored vehicles, and other military vehicles totaling three hundred, destroyed eighteen cannons, sank twenty-five military ships, demolished seven ammunition and gasoline depots, cut off more than twenty important roads, blew up twenty-six bridges, and seized nearly three thousand weapons.

	The report said that under the powerful offensive of the military and civilian forces in the Central South Region, the puppet army and puppet government quickly collapsed. According to preliminary statistics, during this period, more than 25,000 puppet soldiers defected to the people's side, and nearly eighty outposts and sentry posts of puppet soldiers surrendered their weapons. Many outposts and sentry posts of puppet soldiers also rebelled and joined the ranks of the people's liberation forces, fighting alongside the people to annihilate U.S. and puppet forces.

　　湄公河畔凯歌高奏　南部中区捷报纷传
　　越南南方军民同心协力英勇杀敌
    据新华社河内九日电　越南南方军民新春以来在湄公河三角洲战场打出了一派大好形势，美伪集团越来越丧失了对这个素有“谷仓”之称的富饶地区的控制权。
    从一月三十日开始，三角洲各省军民紧密配合，向芹苴、美萩、永隆三大城市以及许多省会、县镇，和敌人的一系列军事基地、据点，发动了暴风骤雨般的强大攻势，给予美伪集团一个接一个的沉重打击。盘踞在这里的美伪军遭到沉重伤亡，美伪集团在各个城镇中的许多军政首脑机构被捣毁，他们“绥靖”农村的罪恶计划在十六个三角洲省份中几乎全部破产。越来越广阔的农村成了人民的天下，胜利的红旗到处迎风招展。
    据不完全统计，仅美萩、鹅贡、芹苴、朔庄和薄寮五个省的军民，在从一月三十一日到二月二十九日期间，就歼灭和瓦解美伪军一万五千三百多名，其中包括全歼美伪军八个营、十二个连、重创六个营和数以十计的连。单是驻扎在美萩和鹅贡两省的伪军主力第七师即被消灭四千五百多名。
    此外，这五个省的军民还击落、击毁、击伤各种飞机二百多架；击毁击伤军车二百三十多辆；击沉船艇二十多艘；摧毁油库和军火库多座，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    在这期间，五个省的军民还摧毁、破坏和迫使敌人撤出一百五十多个据点和哨所，捣毁数十个“战略村”。在朔庄和薄寮两省，拥有五万多人民的广大地区获得了解放。
    永隆省军民在从一月三十一日到二月十四日的半个月内，共歼灭和瓦解敌人三千七百五十名，击落击毁飞机七十九架。
    美国的喉舌美联社供认，人民解放武装力量的强大攻势已使湄公河三角洲陷于“瘫痪状态”。
    美伪军的很大一部分被牵制在城市和县镇之中，而人民解放武装力量则可以在乡村自由活动，陆路交通被破坏而告中断，湄公河沿岸的大部分美伪军前哨据点已经陷落。处境窘迫的美伪军充满悲观失望和惶惶不安的情绪。
    新华社河内十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方南部中区军民接连向敌人发动猛烈进攻，取得了辉煌战果。
    据初步统计，从一月三十日夜间起的近三十个昼夜里，南部中区军民共歼灭敌人一万二千多名，其中有美国侵略军二千五百多名；歼灭敌人四个步兵营（其中美军两个营）、一个装甲车战团、两个装甲营和二十个连；摧毁和重创伪军第七步兵师司令部、三个军事小区的“扫荡”指挥部和伪军两个团的指挥部；攻克和捣毁了三个伪省长老巢、三个省保安团指挥所、四个伪市政厅以及许多伪政权机构，解放了被敌人监禁的大批爱国者。
    全区军民还击落击毁美国强盗飞机四十架，击毁坦克、装甲车和其它军车三百辆，击毁大炮十八门，击沉军用船只二十五艘，摧毁弹药库和汽油库七座，切断二十多条重要公路，炸毁桥梁二十六座，缴获武器近三千件。
    报道说，在南部中区军民的强大攻势下，伪军和伪政权迅速瓦解。据初步统计，在这期间，有二万五千多名伪军弃暗投明，近八十个据点和哨所的伪军士兵向人民缴械投诚。还有许多据点和哨所的伪军士兵举行起义，参加抗美救国行列，同人民解放武装力量和人民配合，消灭美伪军。
