The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the great instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao on the "March 7th" directive, and have achieved great success in conducting military and political training in Shanghai's primary, secondary, and tertiary schools. They have made significant contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Last year, after the great leader Chairman Mao issued the brilliant "March 7th" directive, the officers and soldiers of the PLA stationed in Shanghai swiftly responded. They closely followed, swiftly followed, and thoroughly implemented Chairman Mao's great instructions. They organized numerous military and political training teams, companies, and groups, as well as Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, and went to various schools to help revolutionary teachers and students conduct military and political training. They also participated in work related to the opening of schools, the rectification of organizations, the establishment of three-in-one leadership bodies, and the implementation of struggle, criticism, and transformation. This was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students.

During the military and political training, they focused on the fundamental task of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. After arriving at the schools, the military training units followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments step by step, spreading Mao Zedong Thought everywhere, demonstrating the People's Liberation Army's boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao. In April last year, the military training units followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, mobilized the masses extensively, and used various forms to launch a mass movement of revolutionary criticism. Subsequently, Chairman Mao called for "all primary, secondary, and tertiary schools to resume classes and make revolution." The military training units swiftly implemented this, helping revolutionary teachers and students launch a wave of resuming classes and making revolution. When Chairman Mao issued the great call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," the military training units joined the revolutionary youngsters in exposing and struggling against selfishness, breaking down private interests and establishing public interests. This promoted, consolidated, and developed revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination in many schools. Chairman Mao taught us: "Holding study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." Before and after the Spring Festival this year, the military training units organized large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various schools, extensively studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, extensively discussed the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and extensively debated the responsibilities of the proletarian revolutionary faction. They concentrated their efforts on eliminating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, helping many schools quickly establish revolutionary committees. Originally, there were eleven middle schools in Yangpu District that were constantly at war with each other. With the help of the PLA Air Force stationed in Shanghai, revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination were achieved in all schools within a few days, and school revolutionary committees were established.

The military training units firmly grasped the key of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and firmly believed in and relied on the masses. They firmly implemented and executed the mass line, launched extensive mass movements, and let the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves. The military training units of the Shanghai Garrison Area fully mobilized and relied on the masses. Over the past year, they helped more than 200 primary, secondary, and tertiary schools achieve revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

The officers and soldiers executing military training tasks in the schools carried forward the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army. They always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "All our soldiers must always remember that we are the great People's Liberation Army, the army led by the great Communist Party of China. As long as we always follow the Party's instructions, we will surely be victorious." They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and our army's "Four Firsts," "March 8th Spirit," and the excellent traditions of "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" to help revolutionary youngsters strengthen their revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline. They guided petty-bourgeois thoughts onto the revolutionary track of the proletariat, making revolutionary youngsters establish the belief that "only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself." The officers and soldiers of the East China Sea Fleet executing military training tasks had a common understanding: military and political training is good. It is good because the purpose of military training is to promote the thought revolution of people and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end; it is good because the content of military training is to train revolutionary teachers and students with the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, helping them to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and focusing on the "use" of Mao Zedong Thought; it is good because the method of military training is to adhere to the mass line; it is good because the principle of military training is to highlight proletarian politics, not just the task-oriented view; it is good because it cultivates the younger generation into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    雷厉风行地执行毛主席的伟大指示
    在无产阶级文化大革命中立下新功
    驻沪三军指战员帮助大中小学校实行军训取得很大成绩
    据新华社上海七日电　中国人民解放军驻沪陆海空三军广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行伟大统帅毛主席的“三·七”指示，分期分批到上海大、中、小学校实行军政训练，宣传毛泽东思想，取得了很大成绩，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了功勋。
    去年，伟大领袖毛主席发出光辉的“三·七”指示后，驻沪三军部队指战员闻风而动，对毛主席的伟大指示跟得紧，跟得快，跟得彻底。他们组成了许多军政训练团、营、组和毛泽东思想宣传队，分赴各学校，帮助革命师生实行军政训练，“并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。”受到广大红卫兵小将和革命师生员工的热烈欢迎。
    在军政训练中，他们狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本。各个军训部队到学校后，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，时时处处宣传毛泽东思想，显示了人民解放军对毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚。去年四月份，各军训部队紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，广泛发动群众，运用各种形式，开展革命大批判的群众运动。接着，毛主席又号召“大中小学校都要复课闹革命”，各军训部队又雷厉风行，帮助革命师生掀起了复课闹革命的热潮。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，各军训部队同革命小将一起亮私斗私，破私立公，使许多学校原来对立的两派交心交底，促进、巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合。毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”今年春节前后，军训部队在各校大办特办毛泽东思想学习班，大学大用毛主席的最新指示，大讲特讲无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，大论特论无产阶级革命派的责任，全力围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，推动许多学校迅速地建立起革命委员会。原来，杨浦区有十一所中学“内战”不停。在驻沪空军的帮助下，几天之内就全部实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，建立了校革命委员会。
    军训部队紧紧抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争这个纲，坚定地相信和依靠群众，坚定地贯彻和执行群众路线，大搞群众运动，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。上海警备区军训部队充分发动群众、依靠群众，一年来帮助二百多所大、中学校实现了革命大联合和革命三结合。
    在学校执行军训任务的指战员，发扬了中国人民解放军的光荣传统，他们牢记毛主席的教导：“我全军将士必须时刻牢记，我们是伟大的人民解放军，是伟大的中国共产党领导的队伍。只要我们时刻遵守党的指示，我们就一定胜利。”他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想和我军的“四个第一”，“三八作风”，
  “三大纪律八项注意”的优良传统，去帮助革命小将加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级的革命轨道上来，使革命小将树立起“只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己”的信念。东海舰队执行军训任务的指战员有个共同的体会：军政训练好。好就好在军训的目的是促进人的思想革命化，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；好就好在军训的内容是用光芒四射的毛泽东思想训练革命师生，帮助革命师生活学活用毛泽东思想，在“用”字上狠下功夫；好就好在军训的方法是坚持群众路线；好就好在军训的原则是突出无产阶级政治，而不是单纯的任务观点；好就好在把青少年一代培养成为无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
