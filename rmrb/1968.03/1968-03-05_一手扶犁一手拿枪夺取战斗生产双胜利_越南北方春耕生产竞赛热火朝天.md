Farmers in North Vietnam, fighting on the anti-American front, have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's new battle call. They are holding plows in one hand and guns in the other, vigorously launching spring plowing and sowing production competitions. They are determined to achieve new victories in agricultural production this year.

In the fiercely contested areas of Quang Binh, Nghe An, and Thanh Hoa, local people, despite the relentless bombing by American aggressor planes, persist in both fighting and producing. Local militias actively maintain their air defense networks and stand guard. When enemy planes come, they take up arms to fight; when the planes leave, they work day and night to plow and sow. The armed forces, while carrying out their combat missions, have dispatched personnel to the agricultural support front. The local forces of Ninh Binh Province have contributed 3,000 labor days to help local farmers with spring plowing and sowing.

Inspired by the great victories of the military and people in the South during the New Year, agricultural cooperatives across the North have launched the "For Our Beloved South" competition, which has effectively promoted the completion of spring plowing and sowing tasks. Cooperatives across the country have turned Chairman Ho's battle call into a powerful force driving production. They have strengthened labor management and intensified ideological education, fully mobilizing manpower and resources. Many cooperatives have mobilized more than 90% of their primary and secondary labor force for spring plowing and sowing. Farmers are also striving to transport fertilizer and transplant seedlings at night, so they can concentrate on transplanting during the day. In Thai Binh Province, 10,000 women's transplanting teams have been established to complete the transplanting task. Many places have completed transplanting without missing the agricultural season, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest. By January 20, the provinces of Ninh Binh, Nghe An, Cao Bang, and Lang Son had completed their early rice transplanting tasks. By mid-February, early rice transplanting in North Vietnam had been basically completed. Many areas that have finished transplanting are now actively strengthening field management. Farmers in the Vinh Yen area, despite the enemy's relentless bombing, have completed the first round of weeding for most of their fields.

While striving to complete the early rice transplanting as soon as possible, cooperatives across the country are also vigorously sowing spring rice. The suburbs of Hanoi have summarized the experience of high-yield spring rice from previous years and decided to expand the spring rice planting area. Utilizing the favorable conditions and soil characteristics of the suburbs, they are deeply plowing and carefully managing the fields to strive for three harvests a year. The suburbs of Hai Phong City have sent people to learn from areas with experience in spring rice planting, adopting high-yield varieties and advanced farming techniques to strive for high yields. Many areas are also vigorously sowing coarse grains, vegetables, and economic crops. The provinces of Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ninh Binh, and Quang Binh have increased the area of tuber crops this spring by more than 10,000 hectares compared to last year.

    一手扶犁一手拿枪夺取战斗生产双胜利
    越南北方春耕生产竞赛热火朝天
    新华社河内电　战斗在反美前线的越南北方广大农民积极响应胡志明主席新的战斗号召，一手扶犁，一手拿枪，蓬勃开展春耕春种生产竞赛，决心夺取今年农业生产的新胜利。
    在战斗激烈的广平、义安、清化一带，当地人民不顾美国强盗飞机的狂轰滥炸，坚持边战斗、边生产，民兵自卫队积极搞好防空网，坚持战斗值班。敌机一来就拿起武器战斗，敌机一走就不分昼夜地进行耕种。人民武装力量在紧张地执行战斗任务的同时，纷纷抽调人员开赴支农前线。河静省地方部队用了三千个劳动日，帮助当地农民春耕春种。
    在南方军民新春大捷的鼓舞下，北方各地农业合作社开展的“为骨肉南方”的竞赛运动，有力地推动了春耕春播任务的完成。各地合作社把胡主席的战斗号召变成推动生产的巨大动力，加强了劳动管理，抓紧思想教育工作，充分调动人力、物力，许多合作社调动了百分之九十以上的主次劳动力投入春耕春种。社员们还争取在夜里运肥、拔秧，以便在白天能集中力量插秧。在太平省还成立了一万个妇女插秧组，突击完成插秧任务。许多地方不误农时地插完秧，为夺取丰收打下了基础。到一月二十日为止，河静、义安、高平、谅山等省就完成早稻插秧任务。到二月中旬，越南北方早稻插秧已基本完成。许多已插完秧的地区，正积极加强田间管理。永灵地区农民冒着敌机的狂轰滥炸，已大部分完成第一遍锄草工作。
    在力争早日插完早稻的同时，各地合作社还大力播种春稻。河内郊区总结了过去几年春稻高产的经验，决定扩大春稻种植面积。利用市郊的有利条件和土壤特点，深耕细作，加强管理，争取实现每年收获三造。海防市郊各县派人前往种植春稻有经验的地方取经，采用良种和先进耕作技术，决心夺取高产。许多地区还大力播种杂粮、蔬菜和经济作物。清化、义安，河静、广平等省今春薯类的种植面积比去年增加了一万多公顷。
