Albania's Agricultural Production Cooperatives Hold Fifth Representative Congress

Strengthening Ideological Revolutionization and Consolidating and Developing the Socialist Agricultural Economy

Albania's Great Leader Comrade Enver Hoxha Attends; Comrade Mehmet Shehu Delivers Opening Speech

BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Representative Congress of Albania's Agricultural Production Cooperatives was held from March 15 to 17 in Tirana. The congress discussed the tasks of implementing the important directives of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania regarding further ideological revolutionization, consolidating and developing the socialist agricultural economy, and rapidly developing agricultural and livestock production, especially grain production.

Albania's great leader, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and other party and government leaders attended the meeting.

After Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, Comrade Mehmet Shehu, delivered the opening speech, the congress listened to the report by Minister of Agriculture Piro Dodebiha, titled "Striving for the Rapid Development of Agricultural Production and the Comprehensive Development of Our Cooperativized Countryside."

Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Haki Toska, addressed the congress.

He said, "Our party has wisely led the peasants onto the path of collectivization. Our peasants have loyally followed the party's line, engaged in fierce class struggle, and bravely and enthusiastically fought to realize the program of socialist transformation in the countryside. He pointed out that the completion of agricultural collectivization, the fulfillment and over-fulfillment of the main indicators of agricultural and livestock production, and the further deepening of the ideological and cultural revolution in the countryside are the most important achievements of the peasants since the historic resolution of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour."

He said, "The establishment of the cooperative system is the greatest victory of the party in its struggle to realize the program of socialist construction in the countryside. The superiority of the cooperative system has opened up limitless prospects for the development of productive forces."

Toska said, "Now, an unprecedented revolutionary situation has emerged in our countryside. With the development of this situation, various initiatives for ideological revolutionization to transform people's worldviews continue to appear. The teachings of Marxism-Leninism, the party, and Comrade Hoxha are driving this great revolutionary tide."

Toska pointed out, "Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, the Party of Labour of Albania is successfully leading the great process of further revolutionizing national life. In the countryside, this process, led by the party, blocks all channels for the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism."

Toska said, "In the past two years, cooperative farmers have worked hard, organized the promotion of advanced experience and scientific experiments, and striven for high yields per unit area. Many mountain cooperative communities have ensured self-sufficiency in grain in the first year of collectivization. He said, 'We must not only have a developed industry but also an advanced agriculture; to make our country's economy strong and independent, we must rely on both socialist industry and agriculture.'"

In discussing international issues, Toska said, "The world situation is very favorable for the revolutionary cause and the socialist cause. The imperialist and revisionist front is crumbling. The recent so-called 'consultative meeting' in Budapest shows that modern revisionists have used all kinds of means to achieve their nefarious purposes. They are the enemies of Marxism-Leninism and the peoples of all countries, and they are weak and decaying. Toska stressed, 'If we do not oppose revisionism, we cannot oppose imperialism. Our party unswervingly adheres to the line of struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and in defending the great cause of Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and revolution.'"

In his report, Minister of Agriculture Dodebiha pointed out that the task of this congress is to summarize the experiences accumulated by cooperative members in their labor and struggle, especially the experiences of the past two years, to complete the various tasks proposed by the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour, and to open up new prospects for the further revolutionization of rural life.

He said, "Today, the proportion of cooperative farmland in the total cultivated land area of the country has increased from 86 percent at the time of the previous congress of agricultural production cooperatives (February 1962) to 99 percent, and the number of households joining cooperatives has increased from 71 percent of the total number of households in the country to 98 percent. This is a great victory of the party's line of socialist transformation of agriculture. At the same time, cooperative farmers have continuously highlighted politics, carried out class struggle, destroyed the possible bases for the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, and increasingly demonstrated socialist ideology and communist moral qualities. This is one of the greatest victories of socialism in our countryside."

Dodebiha said, "Due to the constant care of the party and the people's government, a powerful material and technical foundation has been established in our socialist agriculture and is being further strengthened. In this regard, the people of fraternal China under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong have already provided and continue to provide us with great internationalist aid."

He then detailed many important measures that must be taken to further rapidly develop agricultural and livestock production, especially grain production.

Dodebiha also discussed issues such as further improving the socio-economic relations within agricultural production cooperatives, cadres participating in labor, and continuously consolidating and expanding democracy within cooperatives.

During the congress, 48 representatives spoke. After discussion, the congress unanimously agreed with the report made by Dodebiha.

The congress also amended the model constitution of agricultural production cooperatives.

At the closing of the congress, Albania's beloved leader Comrade Hoxha and other party and government leaders, amidst warm applause and cheers, awarded red banners to many agricultural communities that won in the socialist competition and proposed important initiatives for ideological revolutionization.

　　阿尔巴尼亚农业生产合作社举行第五次代表大会
　　加强思想革命化　巩固和发展社会主义农业经济
　　阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志出席  谢胡同志致开幕词
    新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚农业生产合作社第五次代表大会于十五日到十七日在地拉那隆重举行。大会讨论了合作社社员在实现阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会关于思想进一步革命化、巩固和发展社会主义农业经济和最迅速地发展农牧业生产，特别是粮食生产等重要指示中的战斗任务。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志，以及党政其他领导人出席了会议。
    大会在阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志致开幕词后，听取了农业部长皮罗·多德比巴作的题为《争取最迅速地发展农业生产和全面发展我国合作化农村》的报告。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席哈基·托斯卡向大会致贺词。
    他说，我们党英明地领导农民走上了集体化的道路。我国农民忠实地遵循党的路线，通过尖锐的阶级斗争，为实现农村社会主义改造的纲领，勇敢、热情地投入战斗。他指出，农村集体化的完成、农牧业生产的主要指标的完成和超额完成、农村思想文化革命的进一步深入开展，这是劳动党第五次代表大会的历史性决议发表后，农民获得的最重要的成就。
    他说，合作社制度的建立是党在为实现农村社会主义建设纲领而进行的斗争中所取得的最伟大的胜利。合作社制度的优越性为生产力的发展开辟了无限的前景。
    托斯卡说，现在，在我国农村出现了空前未有的革命形势。随着这种形势的发展，深入改造人的世界观的各种革命化倡议不断出现。马克思列宁主义思想、党和霍查同志的教导推动着这一伟大的革命热潮。
    托斯卡指出，在马克思列宁主义学说照耀下的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党正在成功地领导着国家生活进一步革命化的伟大进程。在农村，党领导的这一进程堵塞着在农村产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的一切渠道。
    托斯卡说，最近两年来，合作社农民鼓足干劲，有组织地推广先进经验和科学实验，争取单位面积的高产量。许多山区合作社在合作化的第一年就保证了全年粮食自给。他说，我们不仅应当具有发达的工业，而且应当具有先进的农业；为了使我国经济强大和独立，应当依靠社会主义的工业和农业这两条腿走路。
    托斯卡在谈到国际问题时说，世界形势十分有利于革命事业、社会主义事业。帝国主义和修正主义阵线正在分崩离析。最近在布达佩斯举行的所谓“协商会晤”表明，现代修正主义者为了达到他们的不可告人的目的使尽了种种手段，他们是马克思列宁主义和各国人民的死敌，他们是虚弱和腐朽的。托斯卡强调说，如果不反对修正主义，是不可能反对帝国主义的。我们党毫不动摇地坚持在反对帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的战线上，在保卫马克思列宁主义、社会主义和革命的伟大事业的战线上进行斗争。
    农业部长多德比巴在报告中指出，这次代表大会的任务是总结合作社社员在劳动和斗争中积累起来的经验，特别是总结最近两年来的经验，以完成劳动党第五次代表大会提出的各项任务，为农村生活的进一步革命化开辟新的前景。
    他说，今天，农业生产合作社的耕地面积在全国耕地总面积中的百分比已从农业生产合作社上次代表大会时（一九六二年二月）的百分之八十六提高到了百分之九十九，而加入合作社的农户从占全国农户总数的百分之七十一提高到了百分之九十八。这是党对农业的社会主义改造路线的伟大胜利。与此同时，合作社农民不断突出政治，开展阶级斗争，摧毁可能产生修正主义以及复辟资本主义的基础，越来越多地表现出社会主义思想和共产主义道德品质。这是社会主义在我国农村最伟大的胜利之一。
    多德比巴说，由于党和人民政权的不断关怀，在我国社会主义农业中已经建立了强大的物质技术基础，并在日益得到增强。在这方面，毛泽东同志领导下的兄弟的中国人民已经并正在继续给予我们以巨大的国际主义援助。
    他接着详细谈到了为进一步迅速发展农牧业生产，特别是粮食生产所必须采取的许多重要措施。
    多德比巴还谈到了进一步完善农业生产合作社内部的社会经济关系、干部参加劳动，以及不断巩固和扩大合作社内的民主等问题。
    大会期间，四十八名代表发了言。大会经过讨论，一致同意多德比巴所作的报告。
    大会还修改了农业生产合作社示范章程。
    大会结束时，阿尔巴尼亚人民的敬爱领袖霍查同志和党政其他领导人，在热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，向在社会主义竞赛中获胜和提出重要革命化倡议的许多农业社颁发了红旗。
