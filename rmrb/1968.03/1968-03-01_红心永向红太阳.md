For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has been peddling the "suffer first, enjoy later" bourgeois philosophy of life to our broad masses of Party members. He attempts to make our broad masses of Party members follow his example, first feigning activism and enduring hardships to deceive the Party and the people into "trusting" him, thereby seeking personal fame and profit, and ultimately achieving his shameful goal of usurping the Party and the state. His intentions are so sinister and malicious!

"A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, loyal, and active, with revolutionary interests as his first priority and personal interests subordinate to revolutionary interests." Our platoon's comrades have followed this teaching of Chairman Mao. In recent years, they have repeatedly gone to the vast northwest to struggle against nature. We live in tents, eat sand-laden rice, and drink salty water. The climate in the northwest is changeable, with harsh winters, flying sand, and howling winds that can blow over tents. Comrades often use their bodies to press down the tents and fight against the storms. In the summer, under the scorching sun, the ground is hot, the asphalt melts, and the thermometer bursts. At temperatures over sixty degrees, comrades' backs peel from the sun, and their hands blister from the heat, yet they continue to work without a single complaint. We never think about personal gains. We think about loyalty to Chairman Mao, about bringing glory to Chairman Mao, and about standing up for the revolutionary people of the world. Comrades proudly say: "Knowing there are tigers in the mountains, we still venture into the tiger's den. With the resolve of Yu Gong, we don't mind hardship and fatigue. 'Personal suffering is for the liberation of all humanity, for the laboring masses of the world to not suffer. Others say it's bitter, but we say it's sweet, and it's the greatest joy and happiness.' Many comrades regret not being able to endure such hardships because of work requirements that keep them in the rear."

Our platoon has a comrade who contracted liver disease and, before fully recovering, insisted on leaving the hospital and continuing to work despite his illness. This year, the leadership allowed him to be demobilized, and he happily returned to the countryside. According to the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, this Party member should now reap the benefits after having suffered in the past. However, this comrade said: "The Party's needs are voluntary, steadfastly moving forward, shouldering the revolutionary burden, not relying on past merits but creating new ones, with hearts forever toward the red sun." He resolutely follows the call issued by the Mao Zedong command and happily takes up a new post.

Living facts give the Chinese Khrushchev a resounding slap. In the face of Communist Party members and revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, any poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev can only be a fly hitting a wall.

    红心永向红太阳
    某部第三中队指导员　寿汉能
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫向我们广大党员贩卖
  “先苦后乐”的资产阶级苦乐观。他妄图要广大党员象他那样，先伪装积极，吃点苦，骗取党和人民的“信任”，以求个人名利兼收，达到他篡党篡国的可耻目的。其用心多么阴险毒辣！
    “一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。我们中队的同志正是遵照了毛主席的这个教导，近几年来连续到大西北同大自然奋战。我们住的是帐篷，吃的是砂粒饭，喝的是盐碱水。西北高原，气候多变，酷冬严寒，飞沙走石，呼啸一声，就会把帐篷刮倒。同志们经常用身体压住帐篷，与风暴搏斗。夏日曝晒，大地滚烫，沥青晒化了，温度计也炸了。在六十多度高温下，背晒脱了皮，手烫起了泡，同志们仍然坚持工作，没有一个叫苦。我们根本没有想到个人的“得利”，我们想的是忠于毛主席，想的是为毛主席争光，为世界革命人民争气。同志们豪迈地说：“明知山有虎，偏向虎山行，立下愚公志，那管苦和累。”“个人吃点苦，是为了全人类的解放，为了全世界劳苦大众不吃苦。别人说苦，我们说甜，而且是最大的愉快，最大的幸福。”许多同志因工作需要留守后方，他们为吃不上这样的苦而遗憾。
    我们中队有位同志患了肝病，没等病好就坚决出院，带病坚持工作。今年领导上让他复员，他又愉快地回到农村。按照中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论，这个党员过去吃了苦，现在应该得利了。但是，这位同志说：“党的需要是志愿，坚定不移向前进，革命重担挑在肩，不吃老本立新功，红心永向红太阳。”他坚决按照毛主席司令部发出的号召办事，愉快地走上了新的岗位。
    活生生的事实，给中国赫鲁晓夫一记响亮的耳光。在用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党员、革命战士面前，中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的任何毒素，永远只能是碰壁的苍蝇。
