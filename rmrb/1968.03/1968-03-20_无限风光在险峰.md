Our unit was building a railway in a certain location where the mountains were high and the roads were treacherous, making transportation difficult and obtaining vegetables challenging. The company decided to send me and two other comrades to go up the mountain to clear land and plant vegetables. Upon reaching the mountain, I saw steep cliffs, vertical precipices, and no paths. Everywhere were strange and enormous rocks. It was not just about clearing land and planting vegetables; one false step could mean falling to one's death.

Faced with such a daunting task, should I bravely take on the responsibility or fearfully retreat? I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings:

"Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, that is where we should go to solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. That is what a good comrade should do." Chairman Mao's teachings helped me realize that to ensure our comrades could eat green vegetables, have stronger bodies, complete the construction tasks, and build the railway as soon as possible, even sacrificing one's life would be a noble cause.

I immediately made over fifty Mao Zedong Quotations boards and placed them along the most dangerous and arduous paths. On the mountaintop, I erected a portrait of our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao. From then on, every time I went up the mountain to clear land, Chairman Mao's great image and highest directives became my immense source of strength to overcome countless difficulties.

Summer arrived, and due to the scorching sun, the temperature was high, causing the vegetables to wither. Immediate watering and fertilizing were necessary to save them. At this critical moment, I caught a cold. One day, I carried a load of manure up a sheer cliff. Halfway up, I felt completely drained and wanted to put down my load to rest. At that moment, I looked up and saw the highest directive: "In times of difficulty, our comrades must see achievements, see the light, and boost our courage." Chairman Mao's teachings instantly gave me boundless strength. I thought, doing revolution means overcoming difficulties and forging ahead on paths never trodden before. I must forever carry this heavy load, brave the dangers, and scale the heights! Reciting Chairman Mao's teachings, I climbed for nearly an hour before finally reaching the mountaintop. Looking at Chairman Mao's portrait on the mountaintop, without even unloading my burden, I loudly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years!" On that day, I carried ten loads of manure and water up the mountain, saving the vegetables.

Last year, we produced over seven thousand jin of vegetables, contributing to strengthening our comrades' physical strength and better completing the railway construction tasks.

　　无限风光在险峰
　　铁道兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表  某部五连战士  雍洪才
    我们部队在某地修铁路，那里山高路险，交通不便，吃蔬菜很困难。连里决定让我和另外两个同志上山开荒种菜。我上山一看，笔立的陡坡，垂直的绝壁，简直没有路，到处都是希奇古怪的大石头，不要说开荒种菜，一不小心掉下去，就会粉身碎骨。
    面对着这样艰巨的任务，是勇于挑重担呢，还是贪生怕死打退堂鼓？我反复学习了毛主席的教导：
  “什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的教导使我认识到：为了让同志们能吃上青菜，有更强壮的身体完成施工任务，把铁路早日建成，就是牺牲了自己的生命也是“死得其所”。
    于是，我立即动手制作了五十多块毛主席语录板，插在沿路最危险、最艰苦的地方，在山顶上插上最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的画像。从此，我每次上山开荒，毛主席的伟大形象和最高指示就成了我克服重重困难的巨大动力。
    夏天到了，由于太阳烘烤大地，温度高，蔬菜都枯黄了，必须立即浇水施肥抢救。在这个节骨眼上，我得了感冒。那天我担了一担粪，走到一处绝壁上，浑身一点劲都没有了，真想放下担子来歇歇气。就在这个时候，我抬头见到了最高指示：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的教导，顿时使我增添了无穷的力量。我想，干革命就是要克服困难，要走前人没有走过的道路，我要永远挑着这副重担子闯险道，攀险峰！我默念着毛主席的教导，整整爬了半个来小时，终于爬到了山顶。我望着山顶上的毛主席画像，来不及卸下身上的担子，就大声地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！！”就在这一天，我挑了十挑粪和水上山，把菜救活了。
    去年一年，我们生产了七千多斤蔬菜，为增强同志们的体力、更好地完成铁路建设任务，尽了一分力量。
