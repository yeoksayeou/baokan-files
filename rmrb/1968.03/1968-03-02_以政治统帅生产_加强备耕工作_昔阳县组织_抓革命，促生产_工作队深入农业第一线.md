The revolutionary committee of Xiyang County in Shanxi Province has organized more than 420 revolutionary cadres from county and commune-level leadership organs into several spring "seize the revolution and promote production" work teams. These teams have gone to the front lines of agricultural production, working alongside broad masses of rural grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants. They are leading production with politics, strengthening pre-planting work, and creating a great situation for current production.

At present, more than 95% of the labor force in the rural areas of Xiyang County are engaged in the intense pre-planting activities. They are swinging iron arms and wielding silver hoes, opening mountains and building dams, developing water conservancy projects, and constructing Dazhai-style fields. They are braving the cold to collect and compost fertilizer, delivering it to the fields. Revolutionary masses from all sectors of the county are contributing their strength to spring plowing and production.

The spring "seize the revolution and promote production" work teams in Xiyang County are composed of the heads of the core groups of the county and commune-level Party committees, the chairmen of the revolutionary committees, and general staff members. Each work team is a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought. They regard the thorough implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the soul and foundation of all work, placing it at the forefront of all tasks. They carry Chairman Mao's latest instructions with them, spreading them wherever they go and implementing them wherever they go. They help commune members set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon. Together with the masses, they engage in self-criticism, criticize China's Khrushchev, learn from Dazhai's revolutionary spirit, and insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide pre-planting work. These study classes focus on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles," taking Dazhai as an example, and promoting Mao Zedong's advocacy of the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice. They vigorously address the active thoughts in pre-planting work, applying them actively and seeing immediate results. The work teams also help the masses use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to formulate plans and specific measures for a great leap forward in agricultural production this year.

    以政治统帅生产　加强备耕工作
    昔阳县组织“抓革命，促生产”工作队深入农业第一线
    据新华社太原电　山西省昔阳县革命委员会从县、社两级领导机关抽调四百二十多名革命干部，组成许多支春季“抓革命，促生产”工作队到农业生产第一线，同广大农村基层干部和贫下中农一道，以政治统帅生产，加强备耕工作，使当前生产出现一派大好形势。
    目前，昔阳县农村百分之九十五以上的劳力投入了紧张的备耕活动。他们摇动铁臂，挥舞银锄，开山筑坝，兴修水利，建设大寨田；他们冒着严寒，积肥、沤肥，把肥料送到地里。全县各行各业的革命群众都在为春耕生产贡献力量。
    昔阳县春季“抓革命，促生产”工作队，是由县、社两级党的核心小组组长、革命委员会主任和一般工作人员组成的。各工作队都是毛泽东思想宣传队。他们把全面落实毛主席的最新指示，当作一切工作的灵魂和根本，放在一切工作的首位。他们带着毛主席的最新指示，走到那里，宣传到那里，落实到那里。他们帮助社员开办毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，同社员群众一起斗私，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫，一起学习大寨的革命精神，坚持用毛泽东思想统帅备耕工作。这些学习班以学习毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”为主，以大寨为榜样，发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风，大抓备耕工作中的活思想，活学活用，立竿见影。工作队还帮助社员群众以毛泽东思想为指针，订出了今年农业生产大发展的规划和具体措施。
