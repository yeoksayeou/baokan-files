Today is Vietnam's National Day of Resistance against America. The Chinese people and the soldiers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are filled with great excitement as they extend their warmest congratulations and highest respects to the Vietnamese brothers who have achieved brilliant victories in the war against American aggression. We also extend a warm welcome to the delegation of Vietnamese youth and heroes from the South who have come to our country to participate in the commemorative activities.

Eighteen years ago today, the heroic Vietnamese people bravely repelled the aggressive provocations of American imperialist warships and aircraft, achieving their first victory against American imperialist aggression and intervention. This marked the beginning of the glorious chapter of the Vietnamese people's struggle against America.

Over the past eighteen years, the Vietnamese people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, have been engaged in a long and arduous struggle against American aggression to achieve national independence and unification. They have fought bravely and grown stronger with each battle, creating a favorable revolutionary situation.

Vietnam is currently the focal point of the global anti-American struggle. The great war of the Vietnamese people against American aggression has profound and significant global implications.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will undoubtedly deliver a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world. The great victory of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression is a powerful proof of this."

The victory of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression fully demonstrates the power of people's war, setting a brilliant example for the struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world to achieve liberation. It shows that regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and closely rely on the people to wage a people's war and persist in a protracted struggle, any powerful aggressor can be defeated.

Under the heavy blows of the heroic Vietnamese people, American imperialism is in a state of extreme embarrassment. The American economy is in a state of severe crisis, domestic class contradictions are extremely sharp, and there is intense infighting within the ruling class. The United States is in a very isolated position internationally. American imperialism is deeply mired in the Vietnam War, facing internal and external difficulties, and is in a state of panic.

The revolutionary peoples of the world regard the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle and see the victory of the Vietnamese people as their own victory. They firmly support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end, driving the American aggressors out of Vietnam, and achieving national liberation and unification.

American imperialism and its various lackeys and henchmen are trying every means to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against America. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is even more actively serving American imperialism's policy of aggression against Vietnam. It pretends to support the Vietnamese people while actually betraying them, helping the United States promote the "peace talks" deception, and acting as the number one accomplice of American imperialism. To support the Vietnamese people in defeating the American aggressors, the people of the world must resolutely expose and smash the treacherous plots of the Soviet revisionist clique to betray the Vietnamese people.

The great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, pointed out: "The closer we get to victory, the more difficulties we will face. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will struggle more desperately. Therefore, our military and civilian personnel must strengthen unity, persist in the struggle, fight hard, and fight continuously to achieve greater victories."

Currently, the heroic Vietnamese people are responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms, advancing with victory. No matter how desperately American imperialism expands its war of adventure or how cunningly it plays the "peace talks" deception, it cannot shake the Vietnamese people's resolve for a protracted struggle. The Vietnamese people's war against American aggression will ultimately achieve victory.

The Chinese people, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression as their internationalist duty. The seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are stronger and better prepared. We will steadfastly stand shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

　　向奋战在反美斗争前线的越南人民致敬
　　《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    今天是越南全国反美日。中国人民和中国人民解放军指战员怀着极其兴奋的心情，向在抗美救国战争中取得了辉煌胜利的越南兄弟，致以最热烈的祝贺和最崇高的敬意；并向前来我国参加纪念活动的越南南方青年和歼美勇士代表团，表示最热情的欢迎。
    十八年前的今天，英雄的越南人民，不畏强暴，英勇地击退了美帝国主义派遣军舰和飞机进行的猖狂挑衅活动，取得了反对美帝国主义侵略和干涉的第一个胜利，揭开了越南人民反美斗争的光辉篇章。
    十八年来，具有光荣革命传统的越南人民，为了反对美帝国主义的侵略，争取祖国的独立和统一，同美国侵略者进行长期艰苦卓绝的战斗。他们越战越勇，越战越强，打出了一个大好的革命形势。
    越南是当前世界反美斗争的焦点。越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争，具有深远重大的世界意义。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席指出：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，就是一个有力的证明。”
    越南人民的抗美救国战争的胜利，充分显示了人民战争的威力，为世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争树立了一个光辉的榜样。它表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，紧密依靠人民，进行人民战争，坚持长期抗战，就可以打败任何强大的侵略者。
    在英雄的越南人民的沉重打击下，美帝国主义正处于极其狼狈的困境。美国的经济情况正陷入一个巨大的危机，国内阶级矛盾十分尖锐，统治集团内部争吵得很激烈，美国在国际上的处境十分孤立。美帝国主义深陷在侵越战争的泥潭中无法自拔，内外交困，焦头烂额。
    世界革命人民把越南人民的斗争看作自己的斗争，把越南人民的胜利看作自己的胜利。他们坚决支持越南人民打到底，把美国侵略者赶出越南，实现民族解放和祖国统一的伟大事业。
    美帝国主义及其形形色色的走卒爪牙，千方百计想要扑灭越南人民反美斗争的烈火。而苏修叛徒集团更是最积极不过地为美帝国主义的侵越政策效劳。它对越南人民实行假支持、真出卖，帮助美国推销“和谈”骗局，充当美帝国主义的头号帮凶。全世界人民要支援越南人民战胜美国侵略者，就不能不坚决揭露和粉碎苏修集团叛卖越南人民的罪恶阴谋。
    越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席指出：“越接近胜利，困难将会越多。敌人就象一头走投无路的野兽，将更加疯狂地挣扎。因此，我们军民更要加强团结，坚持战斗，狠狠地打，连续地打，以夺取更大的胜利。”
    目前，英雄的越南人民，正在响应胡志明主席的战斗号召，乘胜前进。不论美帝国主义怎样疯狂地扩大战争冒险，不论美帝国主义怎样狡猾地玩弄“和谈”骗局，都动摇不了越南人民持久作战的决心。越南人民的抗美救国战争必将取得最后胜利。
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，一贯把支援越南人民的抗美救国战争看成是自己的国际主义义务。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民，力量更加强大了，准备更加充分了。我们将坚定不移地同越南人民并肩战斗，彻底打败美国侵略者。
