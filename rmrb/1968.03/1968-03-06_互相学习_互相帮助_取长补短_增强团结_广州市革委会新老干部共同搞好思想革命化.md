The new and old revolutionary cadres of the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, are earnestly studying and implementing Chairman Mao's relevant instructions. They learn from each other, help each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, strengthen unity, and work together to advance their ideological revolutionization. They are determined to build the Revolutionary Committee into a highly revolutionary fighting collective that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The newly established Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee recently held its first full meeting. During the meeting, the new and old revolutionary cadres, focusing on the issues of their mutual relationships, studied Chairman Mao's series of instructions on cadre issues word by word and sentence by sentence. They also used the spare time during the meeting to hold discussion sessions and heart-to-heart talks, learning from each other and effectively strengthening unity.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If our Party does not have a large number of new cadres cooperating with the old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." Everyone studied Chairman Mao's instruction and, in light of the excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution in Guangzhou, had a heated discussion. They unanimously agreed that the Municipal Revolutionary Committee is the power of the proletariat. Every member of the Revolutionary Committee, whether a new cadre or an old cadre, is a servant of the people. The new and old revolutionary cadres must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite as one, and work closely together to make the Municipal Revolutionary Committee truly a united, cohesive, vibrant, and dynamic leadership core and fighting whole. They said: The entire membership of the Revolutionary Committee can only have one ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought; only one direction, which is the direction indicated by Chairman Mao; only one line, which is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; and only one principle, which is the principle of proletarian party spirit. The Municipal Revolutionary Committee must unite more than 95% of the cadres and more than 95% of the masses in the city, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian Cultural Revolution, and turn Guangzhou into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The new cadres of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee feel that the task ahead is enormous as they study Chairman Mao's instructions. They unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, represent the 300 million people of the city, and not represent any particular organization or faction. They must exercise power with party spirit and oppose exercising power with factional spirit. One young standing committee member, after studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "New cadres are bound to have shortcomings. They have participated in the revolution for a short time and lack experience. Some of them still carry with them the tail of the bad thoughts of the old society, that is, the remnants of petty-bourgeois individualism," said, "In the past, I always liked to show off and stir up factions. My mind was full of the idea of 'I alone am correct.' Actually, this is the remnant of petty-bourgeois individualism that Chairman Mao criticized. To ensure that the ironclad dictatorship of the proletariat never changes color, we must uproot all bourgeois 'self' from our minds, firmly establish proletarian 'public,' and pass on and carry forward the excellent revolutionary traditions of the proletariat."

Chairman Mao teaches: "Many young people, due to lack of political experience and social life experience, are not good at comparing old China with new China, and it is not easy for them to deeply understand how our people have experienced countless hardships in struggle to get rid of the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and how much long-term hard work is needed to build a beautiful socialist society." The young new cadres, in light of Chairman Mao's teachings, examined their own thoughts. They believe that to exercise power for the proletariat, to use power well, and to be a good servant of the people, one must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, maintain the fine tradition of hard work, remember the decades of hard struggle of the revolutionary forerunners, learn from the rich experience of the revolutionary forerunners, and pass on the revolutionary tradition from generation to generation. They actively sought out old revolutionary cadres to talk heart-to-heart, asking the old cadres to share their experiences of struggle and talk about revolutionary traditions.

The old revolutionary cadres who participated in the meeting were deeply moved by the young cadres' revolutionary spirit of using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, strictly demanding of themselves, and being willing to learn and ask questions. They reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Their strength, as Stalin said, is their keen sensitivity to new things, and therefore their high enthusiasm and initiative, which some old cadres lack." "Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force. They are the most eager to learn and have the least conservative ideas, especially in the socialist era." They deeply realized that there are many places where new cadres are worth learning from. They actively checked themselves with the new cadres for the mistakes they made during the Cultural Revolution, especially with those new cadres who had more opinions about them, taking responsibility and learning from the young cadres.

During the mutual heart-to-heart talks between the new and old revolutionary cadres, some old cadres shared their painful lessons of making mistakes with the new cadres, earnestly encouraging the new cadres to learn from their lessons, never forget class struggle, and firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought. The old revolutionary cadres' earnest heart-to-heart talks deeply educated many new cadres.

During the first full meeting of the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee, all the new and old revolutionary cadres, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "New and old cadres should respect each other, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, so as to unite as one and carry out common undertakings, and prevent sectarian tendencies," were open and sincere with each other, learned from each other, fought against selfishness and revised their thoughts, strengthened ideological revolutionization, and truly achieved unity in thought. The meeting presented a fighting and united atmosphere. Everyone expressed their determination to "put down their burdens and start their machines," strive to be models in overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening proletarian party spirit, and being servants of the people who do everything for the people and have their hearts with the people. They will forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao in revolution and forever be students of the masses.

    互相学习  互相帮助  取长补短  增强团结
    广州市革委会新老干部共同搞好思想革命化
    据新华社广州五日电　广州市革命委员会的新、老革命干部，怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，认真学习、执行毛主席的有关指示，彼此之间互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，增强团结，共同搞好思想革命化，决心把革命委员会建设成一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的非常革命化的战斗集体。
    新诞生的广州市革命委员会最近召开了第一次全体会议。会议期间，新、老革命干部针对在相互之间的关系上存在的活思想，逐字逐句地学习了毛主席关于干部问题的一系列指示，并且利用会余时间举行座谈会、谈心会，互相谈心、交心，互相学习，有效地增强了团结。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”大家学习了毛主席的这个指示，结合广州市文化大革命的大好形势，进行了热烈的讨论，一致认为，市革命委员会是无产阶级的政权。革命委员会的每一个成员，不管是新干部还是老干部，都是人民的勤务员。新、老革命干部必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，团结一致，亲密合作，使市革命委员会真正成为一个团结的、统一的、富有生命力的、朝气蓬勃的领导核心和战斗的整体。他们说：革命委员会的全体成员只能有一个思想，就是毛泽东思想；只能有一个方向，就是毛主席指引的方向；只能有一个路线，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；只能有一个原则，就是无产阶级党性原则。市革命委员会要团结全市百分之九十五以上的干部和百分之九十五以上的群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把广州市办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    市革命委员会的新干部，越学习毛主席的指示，越感到任务重大。他们一致表示，要坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，当全市三百万人民的代表，不当某个组织、某一派的代表，要用党性掌权，反对用派性掌权。有一位青年常委学习了毛主席“新干部是有缺点的，他们参加革命还不久，还缺乏经验，他们中的有些人还不免带来旧社会不良思想的尾巴，这就是小资产阶级个人主义思想的残余”这一教导以后说，过去我总是好出风头，好闹派性，头脑里“唯我独左”，“唯我正确”的思想相当严重。其实，这就是毛主席批评的小资产阶级个人主义思想的残余。要保证无产阶级专政的铁打江山永远不变颜色，我们就必须铲除自己头脑中的一切资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，把无产阶级的优良的革命传统接过来、传下去。
    毛主席教导说：“不少青年人由于缺少政治经验和社会生活经验，不善于把旧中国和新中国加以比较，不容易深切了解我国人民曾经怎样经历千辛万苦的斗争才摆脱了帝国主义和国民党反动派的压迫，而建立一个美好的社会主义社会要经过怎样的长时间的艰苦劳动。”年轻的新干部对照毛主席的教导，检查了自己的思想。他们认为，要为无产阶级掌好权，用好权，当好人民的勤务员，必须按照毛主席的教导，保持艰苦奋斗的优良作风，牢记革命前辈几十年千辛万苦的斗争历程，学习革命前辈的丰富斗争经验，把革命传统代代传下去。他们纷纷找革命老干部谈心，请老干部介绍斗争经历，讲革命优良传统。
    参加会议的革命老干部，深深为青年干部以毛泽东思想为指针，严格要求自己，说干就干、肯学好问的革命精神所感动。他们重温了毛主席的教导：“他们的长处，正如斯大林说过的，是对于新鲜事物有锐敏的感觉，因而有高度的热情和积极性，而在这一点上，有些老干部则正是缺乏的。”“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。他们最肯学习，最少保守思想，在社会主义时代尤其是这样。”深深认识到新干部值得自己学习的地方很多。他们主动地向新干部检查自己在文化大革命中所犯的错误，特别是找对自己意见比较多的新干部去谈心，主动承担责任，向青年干部学习。
    在新、老革命干部互相谈心时，有些老干部把自己犯了错误的沉痛教训，介绍给新干部，恳切地勉励新干部要以自己的教训为借鉴，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，要牢牢掌握毛泽东思想。革命老干部的恳切谈心，使许多新干部受到深刻的教育。
    广州市革命委员会第一次全体会议期间，全体新、老革命干部按照毛主席“新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业，而防止宗派主义的倾向”的教导，彼此之间开诚相见，互相学习，共同斗私批修，加强思想革命化，真正从思想上达到了团结。会议呈现出一派战斗、团结的气氛。大家纷纷表示，一定要“放下包袱，开动机器”，努力做克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性的模范，做一个一切为人民、一心为人民的勤务员，永远紧跟伟大领袖毛主席干革命，永远做群众的小学生。
