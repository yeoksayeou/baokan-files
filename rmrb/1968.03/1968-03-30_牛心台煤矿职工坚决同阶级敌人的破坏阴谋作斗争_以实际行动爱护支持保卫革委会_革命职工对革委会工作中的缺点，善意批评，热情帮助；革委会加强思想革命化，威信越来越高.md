The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed at Niu Xintai Coal Mine is resolutely implementing the latest directive of the great teacher Chairman Mao, "Revolutionary committees are good." They are earnestly mobilizing all revolutionary workers in the mine to support, cherish, and defend the newly established revolutionary committee with practical actions, making this mine's revolutionary committee increasingly consolidated and perfected amidst the intense class struggle.

The broad revolutionary workers of Niu Xintai Coal Mine, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, were the first in Benxi City to establish a revolutionary committee. The birth of this new type of power organ was met with great joy and enthusiasm by the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat. However, a handful of class enemies were terrified and enraged. They used various means in an attempt to overthrow the revolutionary committee.

Facing this complex situation, the comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the People's Liberation Army repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directives regarding revolutionary committees. Chairman Mao said: "In places and units where power needs to be seized, the principle of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. The name of this power organ is good to be called a revolutionary committee." Everyone studied Chairman Mao's teachings and unanimously agreed: The mine's revolutionary committee is a great achievement of the struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary workers of the entire mine. It represents the revolutionary demands of the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres of the entire mine. It is the command center leading the broad revolutionary masses to fight against class enemies. We must support it, cherish it, and consolidate it, making it increasingly perfect. We must not allow class enemies to shake or overthrow it. Comrade Hu Xinqu, a model soldier and Communist Party member, said: "The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' We will resolutely defend the newly born revolutionary committee with struggle."

The comrades of the propaganda team went to the workers and their families to widely publicize Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and his statements on class and class struggle. They spoke extensively about the facts of class struggle at home and abroad, guiding the broad revolutionary workers to recognize the reactionary nature of class enemies in conjunction with the class struggle within the mine, exposing the plots and tricks of class enemies who attempted to overthrow the revolutionary committee, and greatly enhancing the class struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Revolutionary workers, workers' families, and retired workers throughout the mine all expressed their determination to defend the revolutionary committee with practical actions. Many revolutionary workers said: "The enemy wants to overthrow our newly born revolutionary committee, this is a pipe dream! The resolutions of the revolutionary committee, we will resolutely execute; the calls of the revolutionary committee, we will resolutely respond to; the authority of the revolutionary committee, we will resolutely uphold; the actions of the revolutionary committee, we will resolutely support. The revolutionary committee is a new thing and cannot be without flaws. If it has flaws and errors, we will kindly point them out and enthusiastically help. Whoever wants to overthrow the revolutionary committee, we will resolutely fight to the end!" After the mine's revolutionary committee issued a resolution on seizing the revolution and promoting production, revolutionary workers enthusiastically responded. In the previous period, due to the influence of anarchist thinking, some workers did not strictly follow labor discipline. There was a significant change. Worker Liu Chengru of the tunneling team did not strictly follow labor discipline in the past. After hearing the propaganda of the Liberation Army, he learned that someone wanted to overthrow the revolutionary committee and was very angry. He immediately went to the revolutionary committee to check his own mistakes and the next day actively joined the coal mining battle.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, following Chairman Mao's teachings, paid great attention to educating the masses to correctly handle the flaws and errors in the work of the revolutionary committee. The revolutionary committee had two standing committee members who, due to the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, were once deeply estranged from each other, affecting the work. The comrades of the propaganda team helped them have several heart-to-heart talks and expose their inner thoughts. Through recalling past class bitterness, they jointly criticized the poisoning of the bourgeois reactionary line on themselves. The two quickly eliminated their differences and helped each other in their subsequent work. The correct approach of the propaganda team deeply educated the broad revolutionary masses. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings and, from the perspective of cherishing, kindly pointed out criticisms and sincerely provided help for the errors and flaws in the work of the revolutionary committee. Worker Cao Hongjun of the 361 coal mining team became a standing committee member of the revolutionary committee but was worried about his low ability and feared that he could not do a good job. Therefore, he was hesitant and dared not take responsibility. The comrades of the 361 coal mining team knew about this and immediately invited Cao Hongjun back to the team. The entire team helped him study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and enthusiastically expressed their hopes, resolutely supporting him to stand on the proletarian party's stance and take power for the revolution. Under the enthusiastic support and help of the revolutionary faction, Cao Hongjun eliminated his worries and boldly took on the responsibility of leading work.

Under the guidance of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the People's Liberation Army and the enthusiastic help of the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, the revolutionary committee of Niu Xintai Coal Mine is vigorously promoting its own ideological and organizational revolutionization, setting a good example for the masses in all aspects. The committee's prestige among the masses is also increasingly high. In the past three months, it has led all revolutionary workers in the mine to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and has excellently completed various combat tasks of revolution and production.

    牛心台煤矿职工坚决同阶级敌人的破坏阴谋作斗争
    以实际行动爱护支持保卫革委会
    革命职工对革委会工作中的缺点，善意批评，热情帮助；革委会加强思想革命化，威信越来越高
    新华社沈阳二十九日电　人民解放军某部驻牛心台煤矿毛泽东思想宣传队，坚决落实伟大导师毛主席“革命委员会好”的最新指示，认真发动全矿革命职工以实际行动支持、爱护和保卫新生的革命委员会，使这个矿的革命委员会在激烈的阶级斗争中不断巩固和完善。
    牛心台煤矿广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在本溪市第一个成立了革命委员会。对于这个新型的权力机构的诞生，广大无产阶级革命派无不欢欣鼓舞。可是，一小撮阶级敌人，却怕得要死，恨得要命。他们采取各种手段，妄图把革命委员会整垮。
    面对着这种复杂的情况，人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志们反复学习了毛主席有关革命委员会的最新指示。毛主席说：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”大家学习毛主席的教导，一致认为：矿革命委员会是全矿无产阶级革命派和革命职工向党内一小撮走资派进行夺权斗争的伟大成果，它代表了全矿革命职工、革命干部的革命要求，它是领导广大革命群众向阶级敌人进行战斗的指挥部，对于新生的革命委员会，必须支持它、爱护它、巩固它，使它不断完善。决不允许阶级敌人动摇、颠覆它。五好战士、共产党员胡新奎说：“伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’我们坚决用战斗来保卫新生的革命委员会。”
    宣传队的同志分头到工人、家属中广泛宣传毛主席的伟大战略部署和毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，大讲当前国内外阶级斗争的事实，启发广大革命工人结合矿内阶级斗争的情况，认清阶级敌人的反动本质，揭露了阶级敌人妄想搞垮革命委员会的阴谋诡计，大大提高了广大无产阶级革命派的阶级斗争观念。全矿革命职工、职工家属和退休工人，都表示要用实际行动来坚决保卫革命委员会。许多革命职工说：“敌人想搞垮我们新生的革命委员会，这是白日做梦！革命委员会的决议，我们坚决执行；革命委员会的号召，我们坚决响应；革命委员会的权威，我们坚决维护；革命委员会的行动，我们坚决支持。革命委员会是新生事物，不可能没有缺点。它有了缺点和错误，我们要善意地提出批评，热情地进行帮助。谁要是想搞垮革命委员会，我们就坚决和他斗争到底！”矿革命委员会作出关于抓革命、促生产的决议后，革命职工热烈响应，前一段时期由于受到无政府主义思潮的影响，而对劳动纪律遵守不够的职工，有了很大转变。掘进队工人刘成鲁，过去对劳动纪律遵守不够，他听了解放军的宣传后，知道有人想搞垮革命委员会，非常气愤，立刻到革命委员会检查了自己的错误，第二天就积极投入了夺煤大战。
    毛泽东思想宣传队遵照毛主席的教导，十分注意教育群众正确对待革命委员会工作中的缺点和错误。革委会有两个常委，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，一度彼此隔阂很深，使工作受到影响。宣传队的同志们就帮助他们多次交心、亮私，通过回忆过去的阶级苦，共批资产阶级反动路线对自己的毒害，两个人很快消除了分歧，在以后的工作中互相帮助，共同前进。宣传队的这种正确做法，深深教育了广大革命群众，他们遵照毛主席的教导，对革命委员会工作中的错误和缺点，从爱护的角度出发，善意地提出批评，诚恳地进行帮助。三六一采煤队的工人曹洪钧当了革委会常委后，担心自己能力低，搞不好工作。因此，工作缩手缩脚，不敢大胆负责。三六一采煤队的同志们知道后，马上把曹洪钧找回队里去，全队同志帮助他学习了毛主席的有关教导，热情地给他提出希望，坚决支持他站在无产阶级党性的立场上，为革命掌好权。在革命派的热情支持和帮助下，曹洪钧消除了顾虑，大胆地挑起了领导工作的担子。
    牛心台煤矿革命委员会，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和广大无产阶级革命派的热情帮助下，狠抓自身的思想革命化和组织革命化，处处为群众作出好样子。革委会在群众中的威信也越来越高，三个月以来，率领全矿革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，出色地完成了革命、生产等各项战斗任务。
