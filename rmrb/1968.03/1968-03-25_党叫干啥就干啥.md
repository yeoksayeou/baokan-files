Zhang Benlin is a soldier who has served for twelve years and has been a model soldier every year. With an unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, he goes wherever he is needed and does whatever the Party asks. On his battlefield post, he has always studied diligently and worked hard, and his comrades praise him as a comrade who "completely" and "thoroughly" serves the people.

In the spring of 1960, the company's leadership promoted a soldier who had enlisted with Zhang Benlin to be a squad leader. Zhang Benlin actively helped the new squad leader manage the squad's work. Later, this new squad leader was promoted to deputy platoon leader, and Zhang Benlin became the squad leader. At this time, some people saw Zhang Benlin and started to gossip: "So-and-so enlisted with you, and now he's an officer, but you're still just a regular soldier." However, Zhang Benlin did not think this way. He thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people's service." He saw that the deputy platoon leader was not very bold in his work, so he actively sought him out for a heart-to-heart talk, sincerely saying: "Deputy Platoon Leader, we are old comrades-in-arms. We are both working for the Party. You go ahead and do your job boldly. If you encounter any problems, we can discuss and solve them together." These heartfelt words warmed the deputy platoon leader's heart, and he tightly grasped Zhang Benlin's hand, not knowing what to say for a moment.

In the days that followed, Zhang Benlin always strictly demanded of himself in all aspects and wholeheartedly assisted the deputy platoon leader in managing the platoon's work. Once, the company assigned an urgent repair task to the platoon, but the deputy platoon leader could not be found. Upon hearing this, Zhang Benlin, without a second thought, actively discussed the matter with his squad members, immediately selected a few people, took the toolbox to the tank company, and began the urgent repair task. The deputy platoon leader saw what Zhang Benlin had done, kept it in his heart, and was deeply moved. Now, this deputy platoon leader has been transferred to work in a local area, but whenever he mentions Zhang Benlin, he always speaks with deep affection: "Comrade Zhang Benlin is like a rust-free screw. The Party places him wherever he is needed, and he performs his duties there. He is truly a comrade armed with Mao Zedong Thought!"

    党叫干啥就干啥
    张本林是一个十二年服役年年红的五好战士。他怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的一颗红心，走到那里就战斗在那里，党叫干啥就干啥。他在自己的战斗岗位上，一贯认认真真地学习，踏踏实实地工作，同志们称赞他是一个“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的好同志。
    一九六○年春，连的领导把同张本林一起入伍的一个战士提为班长后，张本林主动地帮助班长把班的工作做好。后来，这个新班长又提升为副排长，张本林当了班长。这时，有的人看到张本林就议论开了：“某同志和你一起入伍，他现在当了干部，你怎么还当普通一兵？”但是，张本林却不是这样想的，他想的是毛主席的教导，“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。他看到副排长工作不大胆，就主动地找他谈心，诚挚地说：“副排长，我们是老战友了，咱们都是为党工作，你大胆地干吧，遇到什么问题，我们可以共同商量解决。”一席贴心话，说得副排长心头热呼呼的，他紧紧握住张本林的手，一时不知说什么好。
    在以后的日子里，张本林在各方面总是严格要求自己，满腔热情地协助副排长搞好排里工作。有一次，连队布置排里一项紧急修车任务，一时找不到副排长。张本林知道后，二话没讲，主动找班里同志商量，立即抽出了几个人，带了工具箱到坦克连，投入了紧张的修车任务。副排长把张本林做的这些事，看在眼里，记在心里，很受感动。现在，这个副排长已经转业到地方工作了，但是一提起张本林同志，他总是满怀深情地说：“张本林同志象一颗不生锈的螺丝钉，党把他拧在那里就在那里发挥作用，真是一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的好同志！”
