The Hong Kong British authorities' plot to illegally deport Hong Kong patriotic film workers Fu Qi and Shi Hui failed, and they mobilized a large number of "riot police" to illegally kidnap Fu Qi and Shi Hui. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Joint Struggle Committee and the Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency issued strong protests.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 16th - After the Hong Kong British authorities' plot to illegally deport Hong Kong patriotic film workers Fu Qi and Shi Hui failed, they mobilized a large number of "riot police" to illegally kidnap Fu Qi and Shi Hui and persecuted Xinhua News Agency reporters and patriotic newspaper reporters on the scene. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Joint Struggle Committee and the Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency both issued statements, strongly protesting against the Hong Kong British authorities.

On the morning of the 14th, Fu Qi and Shi Hui were forcibly escorted by the Hong Kong British authorities to the Luohu Bridge. With a fearless spirit, they repeatedly denounced the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities to the passing travelers, ruthlessly exposing the Hong Kong British authorities' plot to politically persecute and illegally deport them. They also chanted slogans and sang revolutionary songs with the travelers.

Fu Qi and Shi Hui's brave struggle received strong support from their compatriots in the motherland and Hong Kong patriotic compatriots. Compatriots in the motherland and patriotic compatriots enthusiastically hung their most beloved Chairman Mao badges on Fu Qi and Shi Hui's chests and presented them with the most precious gifts, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Fu Qi and Shi Hui were so moved that tears welled up in their eyes. They told their compatriots in the motherland: We can persist in our struggle because of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The more difficult the situation, the more we feel that Chairman Mao is with us. In the concentration camp, we sing "Father and Mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao" every day. We have an eternal red sun in our hearts, and we are not afraid of anything. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao forever. To win the victory in the struggle against British imperialism and violence, we are willing to sit in prison for life.

On the afternoon of the 15th, after Fu Qi and Shi Hui foiled the Hong Kong British authorities' plot to illegally deport them, they walked firmly with their chests adorned with shining Chairman Mao badges, amidst the enthusiastic applause and slogans of their compatriots in the motherland and passing travelers, and boarded the train to Kowloon. When the train arrived at the Sheung Shui station, a large number of "riot police" rushed into the carriage and illegally kidnapped Fu Qi and Shi Hui. Fu Qi and Shi Hui immediately protested to the Hong Kong British authorities. The staff of the Hong Kong China Travel Service who accompanied them back to their residence in Kowloon, as well as the reporters from the Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao," "Wen Wei Po," and "Xin Wan Bao" who were conducting normal interviews on the train, also stood up to protest the British fascist atrocities. At this time, under the command of the deputy director of the Hong Kong British Information Services, Mr. Shi Yunxin, the Hong Kong British police actually handcuffed a Xinhua News Agency reporter and a "Wen Wei Po" reporter and forcibly pulled another female reporter from Xinhua News Agency off the train. After the reporters protested and Fu Qi and Shi Hui were kidnapped, the reporters were released.

With the support of the motherland and the broad patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, Fu Qi and Shi Hui successfully foiled the Hong Kong British authorities' plot to "deport them out of the territory," greatly encouraging the broad patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. Over the past two days, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Joint Struggle Committee against British Persecution and the Anti-Persecution Struggle Committees of the film, news, student communities, and the China Travel Service have issued statements, praising Fu Qi and Shi Hui's brave struggle against the enemy and strongly condemning the new atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities against Hong Kong patriotic compatriots. These statements solemnly declare: We will never allow the Hong Kong British authorities to forcibly deport Fu Qi and Shi Hui. The statements strongly protest the Hong Kong British authorities' illegal kidnapping of Fu Qi and Shi Hui again and the insults and persecution of Xinhua News Agency and patriotic reporters on the scene. The statements demand that the Hong Kong British authorities must immediately release Fu Qi and Shi Hui and the Hong Kong patriotic compatriots who are currently illegally imprisoned in the Ma On Shan Concentration Camp and other prisons; they must completely stop all forms of persecution against Hong Kong patriotic compatriots.

The Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency and the Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee of 14 patriotic news agencies issued statements on the 15th, strongly protesting the Hong Kong British authorities' persecution of two Xinhua News Agency reporters and three patriotic newspaper reporters who were conducting normal interviews.

　　妄图把香港爱国电影工作者非法递解出境的阴谋破产后
　　港英当局再次非法绑架傅奇石慧
　　港九各界斗委会和新华社香港分社提出强烈抗议
    新华社香港十六日电　港英当局妄图把香港爱国电影工作者傅奇和石慧非法递解出境的阴谋遭到破产后，又出动大批“防暴队”非法绑架了傅奇和石慧二人，并对在场的新华社记者和爱国报纸记者进行迫害。港九各界斗委会和新华社香港分社都发表声明，向港英当局提出强烈抗议。
    傅奇和石慧十四日清早被港英当局用暴力押解到罗湖桥头后，他们以蔑视港英警察、特务的大无畏精神，一遍又一遍地向过境旅客控诉港英当局的法西斯暴行，无情地揭露港英当局妄图把他们非法递解出境的政治迫害阴谋，并同旅客一道高呼口号，高唱革命歌曲。
    傅奇和石慧的英勇斗争得到祖国亲人和香港爱国同胞的大力支持。祖国亲人和爱国同胞纷纷把自己最心爱的毛主席像章挂在他们的胸前，并且给他们送来了最宝贵的礼物《毛泽东选集》和《毛主席语录》。傅奇和石慧得到毛主席的革命宝书时，激动得热泪盈眶。他们对祖国亲人说：我们能够坚持斗争，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，越是在艰难困苦的场合，我们越是觉得毛主席和我们心连心。我们在集中营里，天天都要唱《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》。我们心中有个永远不落的红太阳，我们就什么都不怕，我们决心永远跟着毛主席。为了夺取反英抗暴斗争的胜利，我们愿把牢底坐穿。
    十五日下午三时，傅奇和石慧在粉碎了港英非法递解出境的阴谋后，胸前挂满金光闪闪的毛主席像章，迈着坚定的步伐，在祖国亲人和过境旅客的热烈掌声和口号声中，昂首挺胸地踏上开往九龙的火车。当火车驶抵上水车站时，大批“防暴队”涌上车厢，非法绑架了傅奇和石慧。傅奇、石慧当场向港英当局提出严正抗议，陪同他们回转九龙住所的香港中国旅行社职员以及正在火车上进行正常采访的新华社香港分社、香港《大公报》、《文汇报》和《新晚报》的记者，也站起来抗议港英的法西斯暴行。这时，港英警察在港英新闻处副处长史允信的指挥下，竟把一名新华社记者和一名《文汇报》记者扣上手铐，并把新华社的另一名女记者用暴力拉下火车。在记者们提出严正抗议，并在傅奇、石慧被绑架走后，记者们才被恢复自由。
    傅奇和石慧在祖国和香港广大爱国同胞的支援下，胜利地粉碎了港英当局“递解出境”的阴谋，使香港广大爱国同胞受到极大的鼓舞。两天来，港九各界爱国同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会以及电影、新闻、学生界等和中国旅行社的反迫害斗争委员会分别发表声明，热烈赞扬傅奇和石慧同敌人进行英勇斗争的精神，愤怒谴责港英当局迫害香港爱国同胞的新暴行。这些声明严正表示：绝对不容许港英当局把傅奇、石慧强行递解出境。声明对港英当局再次非法绑架傅奇、石慧，并对在现场执行采访任务的新华社和爱国记者进行侮辱和迫害，提出强烈的抗议。声明要港英当局必须立即释放傅奇和石慧以及目前仍被非法囚禁在摩星岭集中营和其他监狱中的香港爱国同胞；必须完全停止对香港爱国同胞的各种迫害。
    新华社香港分社全体工作人员和十四家爱国新闻机构的反迫害斗争委员会十五日分别发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局对正在进行正常采访的两名新华社记者和三名爱国报纸记者进行迫害的罪行。
