People's Liberation Army units from the Guangzhou Military Region have helped local production brigades to set up part-time Mao Zedong Thought study classes, focusing on addressing the living thoughts of community members and cadres in the rural class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-path struggle. They have intensified class education, significantly raising the awareness of community members and cadres in class struggle and line struggle, and continuously deepening the revolutionary criticism in rural areas.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of this unit, while propagating Mao Zedong Thought in rural areas, were pleased to see the revolutionary situation in rural areas was excellent. Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, in the waves of class struggle, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, combated selfishness and criticized revisionism, continuously raising their class consciousness, and achieving victories in both revolution and production. At the same time, the soldiers also found that some community members believed that "the Chinese Khrushchev has been exposed and thoroughly criticized," and that the "selfishness" in the minds of cadres and community members had decreased, leading to the thought that "the revolution has been mostly completed." They had insufficient understanding of the sharp and complex class struggle in rural areas, showing signs of complacency and relaxation, which affected the deepening of the revolutionary criticism. In response to these situations, the military party committee organized the propaganda teams to seriously study the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, making everyone realize that to carry forward the rural class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-path struggle, it is necessary to intensify class education and significantly raise the awareness of community members and cadres in class struggle and line struggle. Therefore, they helped the local production brigades to set up part-time Mao Zedong Thought study classes, mobilizing poor and lower-middle peasants and community members to participate in the study, and making the conduct of class struggle and line struggle education an important content of the study classes.

The various Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of this unit, following Chairman Mao's instructions on letting the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves, encouraged the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and community members to express their thoughts and views, and together find out the various erroneous understandings that hinder the deepening of the revolutionary criticism in rural areas at present. Then, they and the community members and cadres together studied Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, methods, and guidelines on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, as well as Chairman Mao's teachings on criticizing the bourgeoisie among commune members and "you should pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." They also studied important articles from the editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, such as "The Struggle Between the Two Lines in China's Countryside." They guided the community members and cadres to recall the history of the rural class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-path struggle since liberation, to further raise the self-awareness of community members and cadres in carrying out revolutionary criticism. Through this lesson, the broad masses of community members and cadres deeply realized that intensifying the class struggle, deeply criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that the Chinese Khrushchev promoted in rural areas, and thoroughly eliminating its poison, is of great significance in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and turning our country's rural areas into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

On this basis, the comrades from the various Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres held bitter-sweet remembrance meetings. At the meetings, everyone ate bitter-sweet meals, and the old poor peasants who had deep hatred first recalled their bitter experiences. Then, everyone extensively recounted the village history, family history, and personal history of hardships in the old society and the history of standing up after liberation. The comrades from the propaganda teams also, together with the community members and cadres, held "exhibitions on the history of class struggle," deeply conducting class education among the masses, and extensively carrying out the "five studies, five remembrances, five criticisms" activities: studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, recalling the family history of hardships in the old society, and fiercely criticizing the reactionary fallacies promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "exploitation is beneficial" and "developing the rich peasant economy"; studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "only socialism can save China," recalling the history of the struggle for cooperation and commune-ization in this commune and brigade, and fiercely criticizing the black goods peddled by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and the heinous crimes of severely cutting down cooperatives and severely promoting individual farming; studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "one must never forget class struggle," recalling the history of the rural class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-path struggle since liberation, and fiercely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of the theory of "extinguishing class struggle"; studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "it is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind or the west wind prevailing over the east wind, and there is no room for compromise on the line issue," recalling the bitterness of being persecuted by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, and fiercely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's stubborn promotion of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie in the Four Clean-ups and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "politics is the commander, the soul, and the lifeline of all economic work," recalling personal experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and fiercely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes of promoting material incentives. "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." Through these activities, the hatred of the broad masses of community members and cadres towards the Chinese Khrushchev was further ignited, their love for socialism was further deepened, and their proletarian feelings towards the great leader Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line were further strengthened.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the comrades from the propaganda teams organized the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "combating selfishness and criticizing revisionism," consciously igniting a revolution in their souls, breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and raising their awareness in line struggle. In the process of combating selfishness and criticizing revisionism, the comrades from the various propaganda teams all took the lead in expressing their thoughts and combating selfishness, sharing their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and organizing community members and cadres who did well in combating selfishness and criticizing revisionism to share their experiences. Under the influence of the comrades from the propaganda teams, the community members and cadres all consciously listed the harms of "selfishness," listed the crimes of "selfishness," and discussed the relationship between combating selfishness and criticizing revisionism, deeply realizing that "selfishness" is the breeding ground for revisionism and the root cause of the Chinese Khrushchev's restoration of capitalism. Just criticizing revisionism without combating selfishness is like cutting the grass without uprooting it. To carry the rural class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-path struggle through to the end, to make the socialist position in rural areas continuously consolidate and develop, it is necessary to fiercely combat selfishness and fiercely criticize revisionism. The comrades from the various propaganda teams and the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres together, with "combating selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the main task, with the "three articles" as their motto, with Chairman Mao's theory on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat as their weapon, and with the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev as their target, guided everyone to consciously use one of Chairman Mao's viewpoints to criticize one of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies, eliminate one of his poisons in this area, combating "selfishness" once in their souls, uprooting one of the roots of revisionism, solving one problem in their worldview, and letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy one more inch of territory in their minds.

The part-time Mao Zedong Thought study classes set up by the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of this unit, by consistently grasping the class struggle as the main thread, became more lively and effective. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres competed to be the vanguard in combating selfishness and the pioneers in criticizing revisionism, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and the revolutionary criticism in rural areas deepened step by step.

    大抓阶级教育　提高社员和干部觉悟
    集中千仇万恨　狠批中国的赫鲁晓夫
    新华社广州二十八日电　人民解放军广州部队某部毛泽东思想宣传组的指战员，帮助驻地生产队普遍举办业余毛泽东思想学习班，针对广大社员和干部在农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中出现的活思想，狠抓阶级教育，大大提高了社员和干部的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，使农村的革命大批判不断深入发展。
    这支部队毛泽东思想宣传组的指战员在驻地农村宣传毛泽东思想时，高兴地看到农村革命形势大好，广大贫下中农在阶级斗争的风浪中活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，阶级觉悟不断提高，夺得了革命、生产双胜利。同时，指战员们也发现，有些社员认为：“中国赫鲁晓夫已经被揪了出来，斗倒斗臭了”，干部、社员的头脑中“私”字也少了，产生了“革命已经搞得差不多了”的思想，对农村尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争认识不足，表现出麻痹松劲情绪，影响了革命大批判的深入开展。针对这些情况，部队党委组织各宣传组的指战员认真学习了伟大导师毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，使大家认识到，要把农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争深入地开展下去，就必须狠抓阶级教育，大大提高社员、干部的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。于是，他们就帮助驻地生产队大办业余毛泽东思想学习班，发动贫下中农和社员群众普遍参加学习，并且把进行阶级斗争和路线斗争的教育作为学习班的重要内容。
    这个部队的各毛泽东思想宣传组遵循毛主席关于让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的教导，启发贫下中农、革命干部和社员群众亮思想，谈看法，共同找出阻碍当前农村深入开展革命大批判的种种错误认识。接着，他们和社员、干部一起，学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，以及毛主席关于公社农民也要批判资产阶级和“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部的重要文章《中国农村两条道路的斗争》，引导社员、干部回忆解放以来农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史，以进一步提高社员、干部开展革命大批判的自觉性。通过这一课学习，广大社员、干部深深认识到，狠抓阶级斗争，深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行的反革命修正主义路线，彻底肃清其流毒，这对巩固无产阶级专政，把我国农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，有着十分重大的意义。广大贫下中农和革命干部认识提高后，个个怒火满胸，他们在田头地边，村前村后，处处摆开了革命大批判的战场，用大字报和批判会等形式，向中国赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火。
    在这基础上，各毛泽东思想宣传组的同志和贫下中农、革命干部又普遍召开了忆苦思甜会。在会上，大家吃忆苦饭，并由苦大仇深的老贫农首先忆苦思甜，接着大家普遍大讲村史、家史、个人在旧社会的苦难史和解放后的翻身史。宣传组的同志还和社员、干部一起举办了“阶级斗争史展览”，向群众深入进行阶级教育，并且广泛开展了“五学、五忆、五批”活动：学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，忆旧社会的家庭苦难史，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的
  “剥削有功”、“发展富农经济”等反动谬论；学习毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的教导，忆本社、本队实现合作化、公社化的斗争史，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等黑货和大砍合作社、大刮单干风的滔天罪行；学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，忆解放以来农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争史，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”；学习毛主席“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地”的教导，忆遭受资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在四清中大搞形“左”实右和在无产阶级文化大革命中顽固推行资产阶级反动路线的罪行；学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，忆本队本人活学活用毛主席著作的切身体会，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫大搞物质刺激的罪行。“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”，通过这些活动，进一步激发了广大社员、干部对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，对社会主义的无限热爱，加深了广大社员、干部对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想和对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的深厚的无产阶级感情。
    宣传组的同志在毛泽东思想学习班里，组织贫下中农、干部反复学习毛主席“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命，破私立公，提高路线斗争的觉悟。在斗私批修中，各宣传组的同志都带头亮思想、斗私心，畅谈活学活用毛主席最新指示的体会，并且组织斗私批修搞得好的社员、干部向大家介绍自己的体会。在宣传组同志的带动下，社员、干部都自觉地大摆“私”字的危害，大列“私”字的罪状，大谈斗私与批修的关系，深刻地认识到，“私”字是产生修正主义的温床，是中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的祸根。光批修，不斗私，等于斩草不除根。要把农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争进行到底，使农村的社会主义阵地不断巩固和发展，就必须狠斗私，猛批修。各宣传组的同志和贫下中农、革命干部一起，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老三篇”为座右铭，以毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论为武器，以中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命谬论为靶子，引导大家自觉地运用毛主席的一个观点，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个反动谬论，肃清他在本地区的一股流毒，在灵魂深处狠斗一次“私”字，狠挖一次修根，在世界观上解决一个问题，让毛泽东思想在头脑里多占领一分阵地。
    这个部队毛泽东思想宣传组帮助驻地生产队举办的业余毛泽东思想学习班，由于自始至终抓住了阶级斗争这条纲，越办越活泼，越办越有效果。广大贫下中农和革命干部争当斗私的尖兵，批修的闯将，活学活用毛主席著作出现了新的局面，农村的革命大批判步步深入。
