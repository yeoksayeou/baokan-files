The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station commented on the 23rd that the Communist Party of Thailand, which holds high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, has become the core leadership of the Thai people in their heroic struggle against American imperialism and the Sarit-Thanom-Praphas co-sellout clique. Currently, the revolutionary people of Thailand are responding to the call of the Communist Party of Thailand, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely carrying out armed struggle to the end.

The commentary said that the revolution of the Thai people, the liberation of the Thai nation, and the current task of the Thai people to expel American aggressors and overthrow the Sarit-Thanom-Praphas co-sellout clique require a party like the Communist Party of Thailand to lead. Only the Communist Party of Thailand can lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat American imperialism and its running dogs.

The commentary said that under the correct and wise leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the revolutionary cause of the Thai people is flourishing. The armed struggle of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand is rapidly developing in fierce battles. The Communist Party of Thailand's declaration for its 25th anniversary firmly stated, "We are determined to lead the people in armed struggle, mobilize the peasant masses, establish rural base areas, persist in people's war, surround the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seize national power."

The commentary said that the Communist Party of Thailand has made its own contributions in the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership and in supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Therefore, it not only enjoys high prestige among the Thai people but also enjoys high prestige among the revolutionary people of the world.

The commentary said that the U.S. imperialists and their Thai lackeys are terrified of the rapid development and growth of the Communist Party of Thailand, and therefore, they are frantically and maliciously slandering and attacking the Communist Party of Thailand. The more the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people develops, the more they tighten their slanderous propaganda. However, as the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out, being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. Chairman Mao said, "If a party is opposed by the enemy, that is good. It means we have drawn a clear line with the enemy. If the enemy strongly opposes us, saying that we are completely wrong and have no merits, that is even better. It means not only have we drawn a clear line with the enemy, but it also means our work has achieved great success." The malicious slander and attacks by U.S. imperialism and the Sarit-Thanom-Praphas co-sellout clique are merely manifestations of their desperate struggles. This also indicates that the Communist Party of Thailand is completely correct and that it has achieved many successes in leading the heroic struggle of the Thai people's revolution.

The New China News Agency reported on the 29th that according to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station on the 29th, the armed forces of the Thai people under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are fighting stronger and stronger, dealing heavy blows to the U.S.-Thai reactionaries.

The radio station said that so far, in 71 provinces of Thailand, armed patriotic struggles have been launched in 29 provinces. According to incomplete statistics, since August 1965, over two years, the armed forces of the Thai people have fought 750 battles with the enemy, killing more than 1,650 enemy soldiers, shooting down or damaging 6 enemy helicopters, and seizing a batch of weapons.

The radio station said that the armed forces also frequently enter enemy-occupied villages for armed propaganda, mobilizing the masses, eliminating spies, and executing nearly 300 notorious traitors and spies, gaining the enthusiastic welcome and support of the broad masses.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗  坚决把武装斗争进行到底
    泰共已成为领导人民革命的坚强核心
    两年多来，泰共领导的人民武装战斗七百五十一次歼敌一千六百多名
    新华社讯　“泰国人民之声”电台二十三日发表评论说，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗的泰国共产党，已经成为泰国人民同美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团进行英勇斗争的领导核心。目前泰国革命人民正在响应泰国共产党的号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决把武装斗争进行到底。
    评论说，泰国人民的革命，泰国民族的解放，泰国人民当前驱逐美国侵略者、推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团的任务，需要有象泰国共产党这样一个政党来领导，也只有泰国共产党才能带领工人阶级和广大人民群众去战胜美帝国主义和它的走狗。
    评论说，在泰国共产党的正确英明领导下，泰国人民的革命事业正在蓬勃发展。泰共领导下的人民武装斗争，在激烈的战斗中不断迅速发展。泰国共产党为建党二十五周年发表的文告坚决表示“决心领导人民进行武装斗争，发动农民群众，建立农村根据地，坚持人民战争，以农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权”。
    评论说，泰国共产党在同以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中，在支持世界人民革命的斗争中，作出了自己的贡献。因此，她不仅在泰国人民中享有崇高的威望，在世界革命人民中也享有崇高的威望。
    评论说，美帝和它的泰国仆从对泰共的迅速发展壮大怕得要死，因此疯狂地恶毒污蔑和攻击泰国共产党。泰国人民革命斗争越是发展，它们就越加紧造谣污蔑。但是，正如世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席指出的，被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。毛主席说，一个政党“如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团的恶毒污蔑和攻击，只不过是它们垂死挣扎的表现。这同时也表明了泰国共产党是完全正确的，表明了她在领导泰国人民革命的英勇斗争中已作出了很多成绩。
    新华社二十九日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台二十九日广播，泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民武装，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，越战越强，沉重地打击着美泰反动派。
    这家电台说，到目前为止，在泰国七十一个府中，已有二十九个府开展了爱国武装斗争。据不完全统计，从一九六五年八月以来，两年多时间，泰国人民武装同敌人战斗共七百五十一次，歼灭敌人一千六百五十多人，打落打伤敌人直升机六架，并缴获一批武器。
    电台说，人民武装还不断进入敌后村庄进行武装宣传，动员群众，锄奸和处决了近三百名罪大恶极的暗探特务，获得了广大群众的热烈欢迎和支持。
