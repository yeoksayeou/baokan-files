A tank that had undergone minor repairs was not yet ready, but the tank platoon was waiting to drive it. Repairman Chen Xinghai and his comrades worked tirelessly all day to fix the vehicle, ensuring nighttime driving training could proceed.

The lights were turned off. The sound of engines roared from the training ground, signaling the start of training. Chen Xinghai lay in bed, habitually reviewing his day's work with the standards of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and the two "extremes." When he thought about the installation of the front support for the gearbox, he suddenly had doubts: after tightening the bolts, he hadn't installed the locking pin before moving on to other tasks. Had another comrade installed it? He thought and thought, but couldn't remember. If the locking pin wasn't installed, the tank might shake violently on the uneven training ground, and if the bolts loosened, it could cause problems! This would not only affect training but also result in damage to state property. Thinking of this, he became uneasy. It was as if Chairman Mao's teachings were echoing in his ears: "Be extremely responsible in your work," and serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." Suddenly, he felt his face burning with shame and guilt. Why hadn't he checked carefully before letting the tank go out? Although the locking pin was small, not carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions with the utmost care was a big problem. He couldn't lie still any longer. Chairman Mao's instructions were the highest command. He put on his clothes and rushed to the training ground. On the training ground, he anxiously found the tank he had repaired and explained his situation to the driver. After opening the armor plate and checking, sure enough, the locking pin was not installed. Chen Xinghai installed the locking pin and checked all the vehicle's components before finally feeling at ease. He apologized to the driver, "I did not faithfully carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, affecting your training. In the future, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's books more diligently and work hard on the 'use' aspect." The drivers and trainees on the scene were all moved by Chen Xinghai's seriousness in carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions and his extreme sense of responsibility towards his work.

### 一丝不苟地执行毛主席的指示

    一丝不苟地执行毛主席的指示
    一辆小修坦克还没修好，坦克连在等着开车。修理工陈兴海和同志们紧张地工作了一整天，才修复了这辆车，保证了夜间驾驶训练。
    熄灯了。驾驶场上传来阵阵马达声，训练已经开始了。陈兴海躺在床上，习惯地用“完全”“彻底”为人民服务和两个“极端”检查自己一天的工作情况。当他想到安装变速箱前支架的情况时，忽然发生了疑问：自己拧紧了紧密螺栓后，没有打保险片，就去干别的活了，是不是别的同志把保险片打上了呢？想来想去，怎么也记不起来了。如果保险片没打，坦克在起伏不平的驾驶场上剧烈地颠簸，万一螺栓松动了，可要出问题呀！这不仅影响训练，还会使国家财产遭受损失。想到这里，他不安起来了。仿佛毛主席的教导又在耳边清晰地响起……，对工作要“极端的负责任”，为人民服务要“完全”“彻底”。顿时，他感到脸上火辣辣的，心里惭愧起来，为什么自己没有仔细检查好，就让坦克出车呢？保险片虽然不大，但是没有一丝不苟地执行毛主席的指示，可是个大问题。他再也躺不住了。毛主席的指示，就是最高的命令。他披上衣服就向驾驶场上跑去。在驾驶场上，他焦急地找到了自己修理的坦克后，向驾驶员说明了来意，打开装甲板一检查，果然保险片没打。陈兴海打好保险片，又检查了车辆的各个部件，才放下心来。他向驾驶员检讨说：“我没有忠实地执行毛主席的指示，影响了你们的训练。今后一定好好读毛主席的书，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”在场的驾驶员和学员无不被陈兴海这种认真执行毛主席的指示，对工作极端负责的精神所感动。
