The Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam have continued to launch widespread attacks on U.S. and puppet forces over the past week, further exacerbating the enemy's difficulties in managing multiple fronts and sustaining heavy losses.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 22nd, news from Saigon indicates that the Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces have been relentlessly attacking U.S. and puppet forces across various battlefields since the 17th.

From the 17th onwards, U.S. and puppet forces along the 9th Highway south of the demilitarized zone, near Kontum in the Central Highlands, around Saigon, and in the Mekong Delta have been continuously under attack and suffering significant losses.

The U.S. Marine Corps bases along the 9th Highway, including Khe Sanh, Dong Ha, Y-Ling, and Khe Ganh, have frequently come under artillery bombardment from the Liberation Armed Forces. The forces surrounding the Khe Sanh base have been steadily advancing, with some units closing in to within hand grenade-throwing distance of the enemy's outposts. On the morning of the 17th, Liberation Armed Forces infantry briefly breached the outer perimeter of the base, just 70 yards away, using explosive charges to destroy barbed wire and engaging in fierce close combat with the enemy, leaving them in disarray.

Near Kontum, the Liberation Armed Forces have been relentlessly attacking three battalions of the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade over the past few days. On the morning of the 20th, they ambushed one of the U.S. battalions on the 14th Highway between Kontum and Da Lat, inflicting heavy casualties.

In an attempt to rescue the "capital" of Saigon, the U.S. and puppet forces have recently mobilized a large number of troops to conduct large-scale "sweeping" operations around the city. On the 20th, the Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on three battalions of U.S. and puppet forces conducting a "sweep" about 40 kilometers northwest of Saigon, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers. On the 21st and 22nd, the Liberation Armed Forces continued their attacks, targeting Tan Son Nhut Airport, Bien Hoa Airport, and three other targets, destroying and damaging several enemy aircraft.

The Liberation Armed Forces have also been highly active in the Mekong Delta, attacking the provincial capitals of My Tho and An Giang, shelling the Can Tho Airport in Can Tho Province and Soc Trang Airport in Soc Trang Province, and striking various enemy military strongholds in My Tho and Vinh Long Provinces, as well as other provinces, annihilating large numbers of enemy troops.

    南越解放武装力量广泛发动进攻猛袭敌人
    美伪军在各个战场顾此失彼不断挨打损失重大
    据新华社二十二日讯　西贡消息：越南南方人民解放武装力量在最近一周里，继续在各个战场上向美伪军发动广泛进攻，使敌人更加陷于顾此失彼的窘境。
    从十七日以来，美伪军在非军事区以南九号公路沿线、在中部高原的昆嵩市附近、在西贡周围以及湄公河三角洲，不断挨打，遭到许多损失。
    九号公路沿线美国海军陆战队的溪山、东河、犹灵、昆天等基地，经常遭到人民解放武装力量的炮轰。包围溪山基地的人民解放武装力量部队一步一步地向敌人防圈紧逼，有的甚至逼近到离敌人的突击队只有“投掷手榴弹的距离”那么远了。十七日清晨，人民解放武装力量的步兵，一度冲进了离基地仅七十码的外围防圈，用爆破筒炸毁铁丝网，同敌人展开激烈的近战，打得敌人狼狈不堪。
    在昆嵩市附近，人民解放武装力量连日来揪住美国第一七三空降旅的三个营的部队，不断地狠揍它们。二十日清晨，人民解放武装力量在十四号公路从昆嵩到德都的路上，伏击其中的一营美军，使敌人遭到重大伤亡。
    美伪集团为了解救西贡这个伪“首都”之危，最近拼凑了大批兵力，在西贡周围发动大规模“扫荡”。二十日，人民解放武装力量在西贡西北约四十公里的地方，猛烈袭击前往“扫荡”的三个营的美伪军，杀伤许多敌人。二十一日和二十二日，人民解放武装力量又接连向敌人新山一机场、边和机场和其它三个目标发动猛烈炮轰，击毁击伤一批敌机。
    人民解放武装力量在湄公河三角洲也十分活跃，他们进攻了美萩省和安川省的省会，炮轰了芹苴省的茶诺机场和朔庄省的朔庄机场，并且袭击了美萩省和永隆省的一些伪军军事首脑机构以及其它各省的许多敌军据点，歼灭大批敌人。
