After the proletariat seizes political power, is the Party's central task still to engage in class struggle? This is a question that concerns the fundamental nature and tasks of our Party, and it is a marker that distinguishes a Marxist-Leninist party from a revisionist party. On this issue, Chairman Mao's proletarian line on party building and the revisionist line on party building advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev are diametrically opposed.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In our country, although the socialist transformation, in terms of ownership, has been basically completed, ... however, the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador class still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended." Therefore, after the proletariat seizes political power, the Party's central task is still to engage in class struggle. We must carry out the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the political, economic, ideological, and cultural spheres, and continuously strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev, in order to adapt to his needs of counter-revolutionary and usurpation of the Party, openly contradicts Chairman Mao, vigorously advocating the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," claiming that the Party's task is no longer to engage in class struggle. He blathers on about how "national construction work is the central task of our Party nationwide," and "now the task of the people and the Party of our country is to rapidly develop the productive forces," and so on, vigorously advocating that the Party should only focus on production and not engage in class struggle.

Does the Chinese Khrushchev really care about socialist economic construction? No, absolutely not! He spreads these fallacies to change the nature of our Party, making our Party only focus on production and abandon class struggle. This way, it is convenient for the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to attack the proletariat, carry out a capitalist restoration, and change the color of our Party and our country.

All political parties are products of class struggle and tools of class struggle. In modern times, they are either tools for the proletariat to engage in class struggle or tools for the bourgeoisie to engage in class struggle. There has never been a political party in the world that only focuses on production and does not engage in class struggle. The Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique advocates that the Soviet Union "has no classes and class struggle," vigorously advocating "technology first," and turning the Communist Party of the Soviet Union into a party that only engages in "communist construction," a "production party," and an "industrial party." They carried out a capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, turning the Communist Party of the Soviet Union into a tool for their bourgeois dictatorship. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to bring this counter-revolutionary conspiracy to China to realize it, but this will never succeed.

The fundamental task of the Communist Party is to engage in revolution and class struggle. Chairman Mao recently teaches us: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against class enemies." Our Party must be a vigorous vanguard organization and must never forget the fighting task of struggling against class enemies. We must not only be good at defeating all open and hidden class enemies but also be able to continuously struggle against class enemies within our own minds, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and transform our worldview. We must be pioneers in the struggle against enemies and must never abandon class struggle and focus only on production.

The Communist Party must lead the working class and other laboring people to do a good job in production and rapidly build our motherland into a strong socialist country. Anyone who neglects production and does not focus on production is fundamentally wrong. However, our Communist Party engages in production primarily for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, primarily relying on politics. We must, as the great leader Chairman Mao points out, "grasp revolution and promote production," using politics to lead business. The history of our country's 18 years of building the nation shows that every time our Party launches a major political movement and repels the fierce attacks of the bourgeoisie, a high tide of production and construction leaps forward immediately. "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." Only in this way can we avoid losing our direction and truly advance victoriously on the bright path of socialism.

In the past, some Party members in our factory were influenced by the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, forgetting that there are still sharp and complex class struggles in socialist society, mistakenly thinking that the main task of the Party branch is to focus on production, believing that as long as production is good, the country will be rich and strong, the people will be happy, and communism will come. Some people even said: "Good production is real, visible, tangible, strong, and loud; while good politics is empty, invisible, intangible, not strong, and not loud." Some branch leaders also only focused on production and did not ask about politics, detaching themselves from class struggle. When holding branch meetings, they also could not say three sentences without mentioning production. Everyone had opinions about this approach, saying that the branch "only focuses on quantity, not on friends and enemies." As a result, during this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Party branch could not lead the masses to firmly struggle against class enemies. Some Party members, in the sharp struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, once stood on the wrong side. This is a profound lesson!

We must firmly remember the teachings of the great teacher Chairman Mao: "Never forget class struggle," always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to emphasize politics, and always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we truly do a good job in socialist production.

"Grasp revolution and promote production." After the proletarian revolutionary faction in our factory took power, due to the intense study of Chairman Mao's works and the intense criticism of the revolution, the ideological transformation of people was greatly promoted, driving a new leap in production and construction. Since our factory took power, production has exceeded the quota every month. The facts prove that Chairman Mao's teaching that "class struggle, once grasped, is effective" is an unshakable truth.

The reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev have been discarded by the broad revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The Communist Party of China will forever be the vanguard organization that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against class enemies.

    共产党就是要搞阶级斗争
    上海爱民糖果厂革命委员会　真宣
    无产阶级夺取政权以后，党的中心任务是不是依然要搞阶级斗争？这是关系我们党的根本性质和任务的问题，是区别马列主义党和修正主义党的标志。在这个问题上，毛主席的无产阶级建党路线和中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线是根本对立的。
    毛主席教导我们：“在我国，虽然社会主义改造，在所有制方面说来，已经基本完成，……但是，被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束”。因此，在无产阶级夺取政权以后，党的中心任务依然是搞阶级斗争，一定要在政治、经济、思想、文化等方面，把两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争进行到底，不断加强和巩固无产阶级专政。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫为了适应他的反党篡党的需要，公然同毛主席唱反调，极力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，叫嚷党的任务已经不是搞阶级斗争了。他胡说什么“国家建设工作是我党在全国的中心工作”，“现在我国人民和党的任务，就是尽快发展生产力”等等，竭力鼓吹党只要搞生产，不要再搞阶级斗争。
    难道中国赫鲁晓夫真是关心社会主义经济建设吗？不是，绝对不是！他散布这套谬论，目的是要改变我们党的性质，使我们党只埋头搞生产，放弃阶级斗争，这样，就便于中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派向无产阶级进攻，搞资本主义复辟，使我们党和国家改变颜色。
    一切政党都是阶级斗争的产物，都是阶级斗争的工具。在现代，不是无产阶级进行阶级斗争的工具，就是资产阶级进行阶级斗争的工具。世界上从来就没有只搞生产，不搞阶级斗争的政党。苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团就是宣扬什么苏联“已经没有阶级和阶级斗争了”，拚命宣扬“技术第一”，把苏联共产党说成是只搞“共产主义建设”的什么“生产党”、“工业党”，在苏联实行资本主义复辟，把苏联共产党篡改成为他们实行资产阶级专政的工具。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想把这套反革命阴谋搬到中国来实现，这是永远也办不到的。
    共产党的根本任务就是要搞革命，搞阶级斗争。毛主席最近教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”我们党必须是朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织，一时一刻也不能忘记和阶级敌人作斗争的战斗任务。我们不仅要善于战胜一切明的和暗藏的阶级敌人，而且还要能不断地和自己头脑中的阶级敌人作斗争，破私立公，改造世界观。我们一定要在对敌斗争中作闯将，决不能放弃阶级斗争，埋头搞生产。
    共产党一定要领导工人阶级和其他劳动人民搞好生产，迅速地把祖国建设成一个社会主义的强国。谁要是忽视生产、不抓生产，也是根本错误的。但是，我们共产党搞生产，首先是为了中国革命和世界革命，首先要靠政治。必须象伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“抓革命，促生产”，用政治来统帅业务。我们建国十八年来的历史表明：每当我党发动一次大的政治运动，击退资产阶级的猖狂进攻之后，接着就立即出现一个生产建设大跃进的高潮。“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”。只有这样，我们才不会迷失方向，才能真正在社会主义光明大道上胜利前进。
    过去，我厂有些党员同志受了中国赫鲁晓夫谬论的影响，忘掉了社会主义社会中还存在着尖锐的、复杂的阶级斗争，错误地以为党支部的主要任务就是搞生产，以为只要生产搞得好，国家就能富强，人民就能幸福，共产主义就会到来了。有的人还说：“生产好是实的，看得见，摸得着，过得硬，讲得响；而政治好是空的，看不见，摸不着，过不硬，讲不响”。有的支部领导同志也只埋头生产，不问政治，脱离阶级斗争。开起支部会来，也是三句话离不开生产。对这种做法，同志们都有意见，说支部“只抓产量多，不分敌我友”。结果在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，党支部就不能很好地带领群众同阶级敌人作坚决斗争。有些党员同志，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐斗争中，一度站错了队，这是多么深刻的教训啊！
    我们必须牢牢记住伟大导师毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。只有这样，我们才能真正搞好社会主义生产。
      “抓革命，促生产”。我厂无产阶级革命派掌权后，由于狠抓毛主席著作的学习，狠抓革命的大批判，大大促进了人的思想革命化，带动了生产建设的新飞跃。我们厂从夺权以后，生产月月超额完成。事实证明，毛主席的教导“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”是颠扑不破的真理。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论，已经被毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命人民所抛弃。中国共产党永远是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。
