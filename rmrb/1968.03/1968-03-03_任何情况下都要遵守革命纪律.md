Our factory was influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line, and in the early stages of the movement, it split into two major factions. During the "January Revolution" storm, the opposing faction seized power. At that time, our faction's comrades debated whether to obey or disobey socialist labor discipline. A few comrades thought: the opposing faction's seizure of power was not perfect, and we had no need to obey "one faction's discipline." "Obeying this discipline is slavery." At that time, the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team arrived at the factory. They disseminated the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's letter to revolutionary workers and cadres nationwide, and organized everyone to study and discuss it. During the study, the majority of comrades believed: in the movement, different opinions among mass organizations are normal, but they should not affect production. "Grasp revolution, promote production" is Chairman Mao's battle cry. Socialist labor discipline is an indispensable condition for enterprises to carry out normal production. Obeying socialist labor discipline and adhering to the eight-hour workday is the duty of the working class. If we neglect the state's production tasks, fight for the so-called "face" of our small organization, and deliberately create trouble with production, then we are slaves of factionalism and bourgeois individualism.

After this study, we decided: we must fully support the production plans made by the factory and workshops, and each comrade must seriously check the completion of the production plan every day. For those who do not obey labor discipline well, we hold meetings to carry out criticism and self-criticism. We often strive secretly to engage in revolutionary competition with comrades from the brother faction in production. The comrades from the brother faction also firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, grasp revolution, and promote production. After they seized power, from an overall perspective, they arranged production, made plans, and did not discriminate against us. They also strictly required their own faction's masses, and the completion of each person's daily tasks was published on a blackboard in the entire workshop. Some comrades did not complete the plan well, and they often held meetings to find the reasons. Their actions also inspired us.

Now our entire factory has achieved unity under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, and we recently established a revolutionary committee through the "three-in-one combination." In this victorious situation, it is easy to have some slackening of efforts. Therefore, in various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and team meetings within the factory, we often take obeying socialist labor discipline as a subject of study. "Strengthen discipline, and revolution will be invincible." Now is the crucial moment to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must resolutely oppose anarchism, further strengthen proletarian discipline, strive to be models of grasping revolution and promoting production, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    任何情况下都要遵守革命纪律
    北京丝线厂蜡光组工人　张玉祥
    我们工厂由于资产阶级反动路线的影响，运动初期分成了两大派组织。在“一月革命”风暴中，对方组织夺了权，当时，我们组织的战士对遵守不遵守社会主义劳动纪律，就议论纷纷。有少数同志认为：对方组织夺权是不完善的，我们没有必要遵守“一派的纪律”，“遵守这种纪律就是奴隶性”。当时解放军毛泽东思想宣传队正好来到工厂，他们向全厂的职工宣传了中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信，并且组织大家进行了学习和讨论。在学习中，绝大多数同志认为：在运动中，群众组织产生不同观点是正常现象，但不能因此影响生产。“抓革命，促生产”是毛主席发出的战斗号召，社会主义劳动纪律是保证企业进行正常生产不可缺少的条件。遵守社会主义劳动纪律，坚持八小时工作制，是工人阶级应尽的职责。如果把国家的生产任务置于脑后，争自己小组织的所谓“面子”，憋着劲儿，和生产闹别扭，那么我们就是做了小团体主义、资产阶级个人主义的奴隶。
    经过这次学习后，我们决定：厂和车间制定的生产计划要全力支持，每个战士要认真检查每天完成生产计划的情况，有的同志遵守劳动纪律不好，就召开会议开展批评和自我批评。我们经常暗暗地使劲儿，要和兄弟组织的同志在生产上展开革命的竞赛。兄弟组织的同志也是始终牢牢掌握斗争大方向，抓革命，促生产。他们掌权后，从总的方面来看，安排生产、制定计划等等，对我们没有歧视。他们对自己组织里的群众也是严格要求的，每个人每天完成任务的情况在全车间用黑板报公布，有些同志完成计划不好，还经常开会找原因。他们这样做，也鼓舞了我们。
    现在我们全厂已经实现了按部门归口大联合，不久前又实现了革命的三结合，成立了革命委员会。在胜利形势下，容易产生某些松劲情绪。因此，在厂内各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班上，在班组会上，我们经常把遵守社会主义劳动纪律作为学习的内容。“加强纪律性，革命无不胜。”现在正是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们要坚决反对无政府主义，进一步加强无产阶级纪律性，争当抓革命，促生产的模范，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
