Class Struggle Has Not Been Extinguished

Shanghai City, Xuhui District, Tianping Street, Kangping Lane, Worker and Resident Committee, Ding Yunqing, Zhang Linzhu

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: In a socialist society, classes, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist. There is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. The Chinese Khrushchev sings the opposite tune, loudly advocating the theory of "class struggle being extinguished." He blathers on about how "among the bourgeoisie, among the wives of the bourgeoisie, among the children of the bourgeoisie, there is a group of activists who support communism and propagate communism." He attempts to make us let down our class guard against the wives of capitalists, allowing them to launch a rampant attack on us.

In our lane, several big capitalists live here, and their wives use every opportunity and various methods to attack us, the proletariat and laboring women. They loudly promote the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle being extinguished," singing about how "we are all sisters," "in the past, we were all oppressed by our husbands," attempting to use the difference between men and women to blur class antagonism. One capitalist's wife lives in extreme luxury and decadence, employing four people to serve her. However, she actually "complains" at the residents' reading group meeting, saying she is "not enlightened" and took a wrong step by marrying a capitalist, using this to deceive people and confuse class boundaries. These wives of capitalists also vigorously advocate that capitalists and laboring people should "unite and help each other," saying things like "distant relatives are not as good as close neighbors, everyone should care for and help each other." They often invite neighbors to their homes to watch TV, treat them warmly, and constantly give things to their neighbors to curry favor. They are truly insidious. They and the Chinese Khrushchev, top and bottom, blur class boundaries, dreaming of overthrowing the proletarian dictatorship and restoring capitalism. Under the cover of the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle being extinguished," for a period, these wives of capitalists usurped positions such as the lane's cultural and educational director, welfare director, clinic director, and women's director, acting very arrogantly.

They act kindly on the surface but secretly hate the laboring people. One reactionary capitalist, through his wife, recorded in a notebook all the movements of the lane cadres and revolutionary masses who supervised him, and viciously wrote that he would repay in kind. These bloodsuckers are always looking for opportunities, hoping to one day counterattack.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, exposing these bloodsuckers' backers, the Chinese Khrushchev, and these reactionary wives of capitalists have also revealed their true colors. However, the class struggle has not ended. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the realm of ideology will be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle being extinguished," and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, ensuring that our proletarian red regime will never change color.

　　阶级斗争没有熄灭
　　上海市徐汇区天平街道康平里委职工家属  丁韵清　张琳珠
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：社会主义社会还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫大唱反调，拚命宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论。他胡说什么：“在资产阶级中间，在资产阶级的老婆中间，在资产阶级的子女中间，有一批积极分子，赞成共产，宣传共产。”他妄图使我们对资本家的老婆放弃阶级警惕，让她们向我们猖狂进攻。
    我们这条里弄，住了几个大资本家，他们的老婆就利用一切机会，采用各种手法，向我们无产阶级、劳动妇女进攻。她们大肆鼓吹中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，高唱什么：“我们都是妇女姊妹”，“过去都是受丈夫的压迫”，妄图以男女的区别，来抹杀阶级的对立。有一个资本家的老婆生活极端奢侈腐化，家中雇了四个人侍候。但是，她居然在居民读报小组会上“诉苦”，说什么她是“觉悟不高”，错走了一步，嫁给了资本家，借以骗取同情，混淆阶级界限。这些资本家的老婆还拚命鼓吹资本家和劳动人民要
  “团结互助”，说什么：“远亲不如近邻，大家要互相关心帮助。”她们经常让邻居到她们家中去看电视，殷勤招待，还不断送东西给左邻右舍进行拉拢。真可说是无孔不入。她们和中国赫鲁晓夫上呼下应，混淆阶级界限，梦想推翻无产阶级政权，复辟资本主义。在中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的掩护下，有一段时期，这些资本家的老婆篡夺了里弄文教主任、福利主任、卫生站长、妇女主任等等职务，神气活现。
    她们表面上装得和善，而背地里却对劳动人民咬牙切齿。有个反动资本家通过他的老婆把里弄干部和革命群众对他进行监督的一举一动都详细记在本子上，并且恶狠狠地写着要以牙还牙。这些吸血鬼总在窥测时机，妄图有朝一日反攻倒算。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，把这伙吸血鬼的后台老板中国赫鲁晓夫揪出来了，这些反动资本家的老婆也原形毕露了。但是，阶级斗争并没有结束。毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，使我们无产阶级的红色江山永不变色。
