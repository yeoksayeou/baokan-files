Comrade Wilcocks, General Secretary of the New Zealand Communist Party, accompanied by Shè Fùzhì, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, visited the Beijing Knitting Factory on the 16th. Comrade Wilcocks praised the support-left personnel of the 8341 Unit of the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary workers of the Knitting Factory for following the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and achieving great victories. He warmly encouraged all the revolutionary workers of the factory to always be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to constantly and unceasingly study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and to achieve greater victories.

After arriving, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory held a grand welcoming ceremony. The crowd shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and repeatedly waved red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to pay tribute to Comrade Wilcocks.

Comrade Wilcocks delivered a speech full of revolutionary friendship to all the workers of the factory. He said, we warmly congratulate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and we warmly congratulate the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line of the great leader of the Chinese people, the leader of the world Marxist-Leninist movement, Chairman Mao. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China ensures that China will not restore capitalism like the Soviet Union. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is like a sharp blade piercing the rotten heart of the imperialist camp led by the United States. He said, your victory is also our victory, because your victory helps our struggle in New Zealand.

In his speech, Comrade Wilcocks also specially praised the achievements of the People's Liberation Army in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. He said, these achievements were all made under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao. Comrade Wilcocks' speech was met with enthusiastic applause.

Subsequently, Comrade Wilcocks toured various workshops in the factory. He saw that Mao Zedong's portraits and quotations were hung everywhere in the workshops, and learned about the workers' daily practices of reporting to Chairman Mao, making reports, and exchanging quotations from Chairman Mao. He repeatedly expressed his praise. He told the revolutionary committee of the factory and the responsible comrades of the 8341 Unit supporting the left: "The victory of the Knitting Factory is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought."
