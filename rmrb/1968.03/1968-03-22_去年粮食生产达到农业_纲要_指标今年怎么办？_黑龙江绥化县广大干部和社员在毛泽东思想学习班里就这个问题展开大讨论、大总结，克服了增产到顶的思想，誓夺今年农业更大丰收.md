The broad masses of cadres and community members in Suhua County, Heilongjiang, have been discussing and summarizing the issue of what to do after achieving the agricultural "outline" target for grain production last year in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have overcome the idea that production has reached its peak and are determined to achieve an even greater harvest this year.

The People's Daily reports: After achieving the agricultural "outline" target last year, what should be done this year? The broad masses of rural cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants in Suhua County, Heilongjiang, which has already achieved the agricultural "outline" target, have recently conducted extensive discussions and summaries in Mao Zedong Thought study classes on this issue. They have further comprehensively implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, focused on revolution, and vigorously promoted production, making revolution and production boil with enthusiasm.

Is it to maintain the status quo or to continue leaping forward?

Last year, the broad masses of rural cadres and community members in Suhua County, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fought against nature, fought against the land, and fought against class enemies. On the basis of several years of continuous leaps, agricultural production surpassed the "outline" target. After the great harvest, most rural cadres and community members were eager to make another leap forward this year. However, some cadres and community members had the idea that production had reached its peak. Some cadres said, "Last year, we worked day and night with the community members, and our efforts were exhausted. If we can maintain this production level this year, it would be good enough." Some community members said, "I have lived for over sixty years, and I have never even heard of such a high grain yield." Others said, "It is easy to reach the 'outline,' but it is difficult to cross the 'Yellow River.'"

The revolutionary committee believed that this idea was a major obstacle to this year's preparation for production. If this problem is not solved, it will be impossible to achieve an even greater harvest this year, and it may even lead to a decline. Therefore, they took solving this problem as a key issue.

As early as last winter, the county revolutionary committee organized county and commune Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into the grassroots, conduct extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and discuss extensively the topic of "After reaching the 'outline,' is it to maintain the status quo or to continue leaping forward?" During the discussion, they organized the broad masses of cadres and community members to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "Human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress" and "Humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind," and extensively talked about the situation, listed favorable and unfavorable factors, linked them to reality, and thoroughly criticized selfishness, examined its harm, found its root cause, compared with Dazhai, found the gap, and found the problem. Through this, cadres and community members recognized the situation and raised their awareness. The broad masses of cadres and community members in Xinhua Commune said: This study has awakened us. Having a little achievement and not taking another step, only looking back and not forward, this cannot keep up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and cannot achieve the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The cadres and community members in Six He Village, Xingfu Commune said: Although the grain yield has surpassed the "outline," there is still a big gap compared to Dazhai. The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is not held as high as Dazhai's, the spirit of continuous revolution is not as strong as Dazhai's, and the self-reliance is not as sufficient as Dazhai's. Dazhai is so advanced and still strives forward, but we are satisfied after reaching the "outline." This idea is unacceptable. The broad masses of cadres and community members raised their awareness and decided to take Dazhai as an example and, on the basis of reaching the "outline" last year, strive for another leap forward.

Should we prepare our minds first or our materials first?

In the face of numerous tasks in the preparation for spring plowing, some cadres and community members were not entirely clear on whether to prioritize mental preparation or material preparation. When the preparation for spring plowing reached its peak, some commune cadres felt they had energy but did not know where to start; others only focused on production and dragged their feet in preparation work. The leadership at all levels, in response to this situation, organized the broad masses of cadres and community members in study classes to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, discuss how to do a good job in preparation for spring plowing, and summarize the experience of last year's unprecedented harvest. Many cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants said: Last year's achievement of the "outline" was not due to heaven or earth but to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Among countless experiences, the most fundamental experience is to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide revolution and production. This year, to leap forward again, we must comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promote preparation for spring plowing with revolution, prepare people first, and prepare minds first. With clear awareness, since last winter, according to the different problems in the minds of cadres and community members at each stage, three thousand different types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held, with more than 120,000 participants. They repeatedly studied the "Three Old Articles" and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, thoroughly criticized selfishness and established selflessness. With the improvement of people's minds, problems in production and materials were also solved. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the county voluntarily donated the fertilizer prepared for their private plots to the production teams, solving the problem of insufficient fertilizer; many production teams, to speed up the delivery of fertilizer, adopted the method of carrying it by hand and cart. Each place, based on the requirements of high standards, high quality, and high speed, prepared for spring plowing better than any other year.

Should cadres stay above or go deep down?

After the preparation for spring plowing reached its peak throughout the county, a new problem was presented to cadres at all levels: should they stay above or go deep down and, together with the masses, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and make preparation for spring plowing even better? As soon as spring plowing began, the county revolutionary committee, aiming at the idea of some cadres staying above and not wanting to go deep into the grassroots, took this as a major issue to be solved in the county and commune-level cadre study classes. Through studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. This is what a good comrade should do," they conducted extensive great debates. Everyone unanimously recognized that staying above or going deep down is not just a matter of work style but a major issue concerning where the leadership goes and whether Chairman Mao's latest instructions can be turned into the conscious actions of the broad masses. After raising their awareness, counties and communes mobilized batches of cadres to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, adopting the method of going all the way to the production front line, and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. For example, the county and commune Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team went to Six He Village, Xingfu Commune, and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, worked and studied, discovering that the revolutionary criticism was not deep enough and that some cadres and community members, due to reaching the "outline" last year, had developed blind optimism and were not tightly grasping the preparation for spring plowing. In response to this situation, the team members worked with the community members during the day and participated in study classes and revolutionary criticism at night, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, summarizing last year's increase in production experience, inspecting this year's preparation for spring plowing work, and formulating this year's increase in production measures. As a result, the revolution and production in this village changed from cold and quiet to vigorous. Due to the sabotage by class enemies, the preparation for spring plowing in some production teams in Xinsheng Commune was far behind. After the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team went down, through working and studying with the poor and lower-middle peasants Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, and introducing the experience of other places in closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, strengthening the consciousness of class struggle, and overcoming anarchism, the broad masses of cadres and community members sharpened their eyes, saw through the class enemies' sabotage of production, and repelled the class enemies' attacks, making revolution and production present a new situation.

Currently, the revolution and production in the rural areas of the entire county present a very good situation. Everyone reads Chairman Mao's books, and every family conducts self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. The preparation for spring plowing is in full swing. The entire county has mobilized 26,000 people to brave the wind and snow to dig and transport fertilizer and engage in water conservancy projects, and more than half of the cultivated land has been fertilized. The broad masses of cadres and community members are full of confidence and determined to achieve an even greater harvest this year, making new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 去年粮食生产达到农业“纲要”指标今年怎么办？  黑龙江绥化县广大干部和社员在毛泽东思想学习班里就这个问题展开大讨论、大总结，克服了增产到顶的思想，誓夺今年农业更大丰收

    去年粮食生产达到农业“纲要”指标今年怎么办？
    黑龙江绥化县广大干部和社员在毛泽东思想学习班里就这个问题展开大讨论、大总结，克服了增产到顶的思想，誓夺今年农业更大丰收
    本报讯　去年粮食生产达到农业“纲要”今年该怎么办？黑龙江省已经达到农业“纲要”指标的绥化县广大农村干部和贫下中农，最近就这个问题在毛泽东思想学习班里广泛展开了大讨论、大总结，进一步全面落实毛主席最新指示，狠抓革命，猛促生产，把革命、生产搞得热气腾腾。
    是维持现状，还是继续跃进？
    去年绥化县广大农村干部和社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，与天斗，与地斗，同阶级敌人斗，在连续几年跃进的基础上，农业生产跨过了“纲要”指标。大丰收之后，农村大多数干部、社员再鼓干劲，决心争取今年更大跃进。但是，也有一部分干部和社员出现了“增产到顶”思想。有的干部说：“去年起早贪黑和社员干了一年，劲算使到头了，今年能保住这个产量就不错了。”有的社员说：“我活了六十多岁，甭说看着地打这么多粮食，就连听说过都没有。”还有的说：“上‘纲要’容易，过‘黄河’就难了。”
    县革委会认为这种思想是今年备耕生产的很大阻力。这个问题不解决，就不能夺得今年更大的丰收，弄不好，还会走下坡路。于是便把解决这个问题作为关键来抓。
    早在去年冬天，县革命委员会就组织县、社毛泽东思想宣传队，深入基层，大办毛泽东思想学习班，进行斗私批修，并以“上‘纲要’以后，是维持现状，还是持续跃进”为题，开展大讨论。在讨论中，组织广大干部、社员学习毛主席关于“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”和“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”等教导，大谈形势，大摆有利条件和不利因素，联系实际，狠斗私，查危害，找根源，再和大寨比，找差距，找问题。从而使干部、社员认清了形势，提高了认识。新华公社的广大干部和社员说：这一学可醒悟了。有一点成绩就不迈步了，光往后看，不往前看，这就跟不上毛主席的伟大战略部署，就不能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。兴福公社六合大队的干部、社员说：粮食产量虽然跨过“纲要”，但和大寨比差距很大。毛泽东思想伟大红旗不如大寨举得高，不断革命精神不如大寨强，自力更生劲头不如大寨足。大寨那样先进，还一个劲地往前奔，我们上了“纲要”就满足了，这种思想要不得。广大干部、社员的认识提高了，决心以大寨为榜样，在去年上“纲要”的基础上，更上一层楼。
    先备思想，还是先备物资？
    在备耕工作千头万绪的情况下，是思想准备第一，还是物资准备第一？在备耕工作开始的时候，有些干部和社员对这个问题认识不十分清楚。当备耕生产高潮掀起来之后，有的社队干部感到有劲使不出，不知从哪儿下手；也有的光在生产上打主意，把备耕工作搞得慢慢腾腾。各级领导班子针对这种情况，组织广大干部、社员在学习班里反复学习毛主席有关教导，开展如何搞好备耕生产大讨论，同时总结了去年农业生产获得空前大丰收的经验。许多干部和贫下中农都说：去年上“纲要”，不靠天，不靠地，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。千经验，万经验，用毛泽东思想统帅革命和生产是最根本的经验。今年要再往上跃，就得全面落实毛主席的最新指示，以革命促备耕，备耕先备人，备人先备思想。认识明确了，去冬以来，根据每个时期干部、社员思想上存在的不同问题，先后举办了三千个不同类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加的有十二万多人，反复学习了“老三篇”和毛主席一系列最新指示，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。人的思想提高了，生产和物资方面的问题也就迎刃而解了。全县广大贫下中农自动地把准备上自留地的粪肥献给了生产队，解决了粪肥不足的困难；许多生产队为了加快送粪的进度，采取人挑车送的方法。各地都本着高标准、高质量、高速度的要求，备耕生产比以往任何一年都搞得好。
    干部是浮在上面，还是深入下去？
    全县备耕生产高潮掀起来以后，给各级干部提出了一个新问题，就是浮在上面，还是深入下去，同群众一道落实毛主席最新指示，把备耕生产搞得好上加好？春耕刚一开始，县革命委员会就对一部分干部浮在上面，不愿深入基层的思想，有目的地在举办县、社两级干部学习班时，作为主要问题加以解决。通过学习毛主席关于“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”的教导，开展大鸣大放大辩论。大家一致认识到，浮在上面，还是深入下去，不单单是思想作风问题，是关系到领导班子向何处去的大问题，是关系到能否把毛主席最新指示变为广大群众自觉行动的大问题。认识提高以后，县、社动员大批干部组成毛泽东思想宣传队，采取一竿子插到底的方法，杀上生产第一线，和贫下中农一起落实毛主席最新指示。例如县社毛泽东思想宣传队来到兴福公社六合大队，和贫下中农一起劳动，一起学习，发现革命大批判搞得不深，一部分干部、社员由于去年上了“纲要”，便产生了盲目乐观情绪，对今年备耕生产抓得不紧。针对这种情况，宣传队的同志白天和社员一起干活，晚间一起参加学习班，一起搞革命大批判，以毛主席最新指示为武器，总结去年的增产经验，检查今年的备耕工作，制定今年的增产措施。因而使这个大队革命和生产由冷冷清清变为轰轰烈烈。新生公社一部分生产队由于阶级敌人的破坏，备耕生产十分落后。毛泽东思想宣传队下去后，通过同贫下中农同劳动，一起学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，并介绍外地紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，加强阶级斗争观念，打倒无政府主义的经验，使广大干部、社员擦亮了眼睛，识破了阶级敌人破坏生产的阴谋，打退了阶级敌人的进攻，革命和生产出现了新气象。
    目前，全县农村革命和生产呈现一派大好形势。人人读毛主席的书，家家开展斗私批修，备耕生产热火朝天。全县出动二万六千人顶风冒雪刨粪送粪和兴修水利，一半以上的耕地已送满了粪。广大社员干部满怀信心誓夺今年农业的更大丰收，为无产阶级文化大革命再立新功。　（毕长春　冯国信　陈伯山）
