The Japanese revolutionary theater troupe, the Gear Playhouse, performed the revolutionary drama "Wildfire" on the evening of March 21 in Tokyo, which was attended by about 2,000 people from various circles in Tokyo. This drama, which embodies Chairman Mao's great truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," greatly inspired the Japanese workers and peasants who watched it.

The theater was adorned with quotations from the great leader Chairman Mao: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first and foremost for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for them and for their use."

At the beginning of each performance, a young actress would hold up a red copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and recite aloud.

When farmers from Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka and Yamanashi Prefecture's Minami-Fuji saw the impoverished farmers on stage holding weapons to defeat the landlords and police, and finally rise up in armed rebellion against the autocratic regime, they enthusiastically cheered loudly.

In the final scene, when a giant portrait of Chairman Mao appeared on the stage and the "Internationale" played, the audience stood up, waving their red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands, expressing their boundless respect and love for Chairman Mao. After the performance, the deeply moved audience reluctantly left their seats, singing "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

Before the performance, the chairman of the Tokyo branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Nishikawa Keibu, said: "Last year, Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Premier Zhou Enlai received the entire Gear Playhouse troupe visiting China, which made the Japanese people fighting against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries feel very happy and greatly inspired." He said, "The revolutionary drama 'Wildfire' embodies the truth that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' and is a drama that serves the people's struggle by adhering to Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line."

After watching "Wildfire," Ohmori Matsutomi and Watanabe Kimie, leaders of the Minami-Fuji farmers' movement, who are bravely fighting against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, said that the script, written under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, fully expresses the feelings of Japanese farmers fighting against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. What we learn from this play is to persist in the struggle until we achieve final victory.

The chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Nakajima Takeshige, said: The drama "Wildfire" has opened a new chapter in the history of Japanese drama. This play stands firmly on the side of the people and inspires the people's struggle. After watching "Wildfire," people will be more courageous in joining the battle. This is the result of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Recently, people from various circles in Yamaguchi Prefecture have been expressing their views to reporters from the Oriental News Agency, praising the success of the Gear Playhouse's performance of the revolutionary drama "Wildfire" as a victory in implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line.

A bus conductor, Hatanaka Takako, said: "Wildfire" is the first drama in Japan written for the people, especially for the workers and peasants. After watching the performance, I once again fully realized the truth of Chairman Mao's teaching: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history."

A leader of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party, Anetsugu Takayuki, said in an interview: The performance of the drama "Wildfire" has received enthusiastic support and praise from the revolutionary people of Yamaguchi Prefecture. This is a victory in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

    “枪杆子里面出政权”是伟大真理
    日本齿轮座剧团演出革命话剧《野火》极大鼓舞日本人民
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本革命剧团齿轮座二十一日晚上在东京演出了描写农民起义的话剧《野火》，东京各界人民约两千人观看了这次演出。这个体现毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”伟大真理的革命话剧，使日本工农观众受到了巨大鼓舞。
    剧场内悬挂着伟大领袖毛主席的语录：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”
    每一场演出开始时，都有一位青年女演员捧着红彤彤的宝书《毛主席语录》，高声朗诵。
    当千叶县三里塚和山梨县北富士的几十个农民看到台上的贫苦农民手持武器打败地主和警察，最后起来举行武装暴动反对专制制度时，他们热情地高声欢呼。
    在最后一场，当天幕上出现毛主席的巨幅画像并响起《国际歌》时，观众起立，热情地挥动手中红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，表示对毛主席的无限敬仰和热爱。演出结束后，深受感动的观众依依不舍地留在座位上，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《东方红》。
    日中友好协会（正统）东京都总部会长西川景文在演出前致词说：“毛泽东主席和林彪副主席以及周恩来总理去年接见了访华的齿轮座剧团全体团员，使正在同美日反动派作斗争的日本人民感到十分高兴和莫大鼓舞。”他说：“革命话剧《野火》体现了‘枪杆子里面出政权’的真理，是贯彻毛主席的革命文艺路线的为人民斗争服务的话剧。”
    正在同美日反动派进行英勇斗争的北富士农民运动领导人大森松富和渡边喜美江在观看《野火》以后说，在毛泽东思想指导下编写的这个剧本完全表达了正在同美日反动派进行斗争的日本农民的感情。我们从这出戏里学到的是坚持斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏说：话剧《野火》打开了日本话剧史上新的一页。这出戏坚定地站在人民一边，鼓舞着人民的斗争。人们看了《野火》后，将更加英勇投入战斗。这就是活学活用毛泽东思想的成果。
    山口县各界人民最近纷纷向东方通讯社记者发表谈话，赞扬齿轮座剧团演出的革命话剧《野火》的成功是执行毛主席文艺路线的胜利。
    公共汽车女售票员旗野高子说：“《野火》是日本第一次为人民，特别是为工农编写的话剧。看了演出之后，我再一次充分认识到毛主席的教导：‘人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力’这个真理。”
    日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）的一位领导人穴迫隆之在谈话中说：话剧《野火》的演出，受到山口县革命人民的热情支持和赞扬。这是执行毛主席革命文艺路线的胜利。
