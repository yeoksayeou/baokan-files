The military and civilian population of the Central Region of South Vietnam, located south of Saigon, have continuously dealt heavy blows to the U.S.-puppet forces from January 31 to March 15, annihilating a large number of puppet troops and routing the American aggressors, thus foiling the "strategic pacification" plot of the U.S.-puppet clique in this region.

According to incomplete statistics, the military and civilian population of the Central Region have, during this period, killed, wounded, and captured more than 18,500 enemy troops, including over 3,100 American and mercenary troops. Nearly half of the 2nd Brigade of the U.S. 9th Infantry Division has been annihilated. Among the enemy forces annihilated are an entire armored car regiment, five infantry battalions (three of which are American), two armored battalions, and twenty companies (four of which are American), as well as six severely damaged battalions. The people of the entire region have also destroyed nearly 200 enemy tanks and armored vehicles and 230 other military vehicles, shot down or destroyed 100 aircraft, sunk or damaged 60 military vessels, burned 10 fuel and ammunition depots, and seized 3,000 weapons.

The report states that during this period, the People's Liberation Armed Forces attacked the cities of Mỹ Tho, Bến Tre, Trà Vinh, Châu Đốc, Cà Mau, and Gò Công, as well as nearly 20 counties. Under the heavy blows of the broad masses of military and civilian population, many enemy command posts and puppet government agencies have been paralyzed, and the enemy is in a state of panic, with morale further plummeting. During this period, more than 20,000 puppet soldiers have deserted.

The military and civilian population of the Central Region have also cut off and controlled many important enemy water and land transportation lines, such as the 4th, 6th, 12th, 24th, and 28th highways, as well as the Mekong River, causing the enemy's transportation to be paralyzed and annihilating a large number of enemy troops, as well as destroying a large number of enemy transportation vehicles.

In these 45 days, the People's Liberation Armed Forces and the broad masses of the people have closely cooperated, captured, and forced the enemy to withdraw from more than 260 outposts and sentry posts, destroyed 150 "strategic hamlets," liberated nearly 30 towns with a population of over 300,000, and foiled the enemy's plot to pacify the Mekong Delta.

    报道说，在这期间，人民解放武装力量袭击了美萩、槟椥、朱笃、建祥、高岭、鹅贡等市和近二十个县城。在广大军民的沉重打击下，敌人的许多指挥部和伪政权机构陷于瘫痪，敌人恐慌万状，士气更加低落，在这期间有两万多名伪军士兵逃跑。
    南部中区军民还切断和控制了敌人许多重要的水陆交通线，如第四号、第六号、第十二号、第二十四号和第二十八号公路以及湄公河等，使敌人的交通陷于瘫痪，并且消灭了敌人大量有生力量，击毁了敌人大量交通工具。
    在这四十五天中，南部中区人民解放武装力量和广大人民密切配合，攻克和迫使敌人撤出二百六十多个据点和哨所，捣毁了一百五十个“战略村”，解放了有三十多万人口的近三十个乡，使敌人“绥靖”湄公河三角洲的阴谋破产。
