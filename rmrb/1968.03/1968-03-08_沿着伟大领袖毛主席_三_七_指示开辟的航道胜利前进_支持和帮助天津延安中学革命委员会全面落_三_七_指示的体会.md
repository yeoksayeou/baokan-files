Our great teacher Chairman Mao, on March 7, 1967, made the famous March 7th instructions regarding the report "Tianjin Yuandan Middle School's Experience in Achieving School-Wide Unity and Organizing, Strengthening, and Developing the Red Guards Based on Teaching Classes." These instructions are a great strategic deployment for the proletarian cultural revolution. Like a lighthouse shining brightly, they illuminate the path forward for the proletarian cultural revolution. Over the past year, we, along with the revolutionary teachers and students of Yuandan Middle School, have fully implemented the March 7th instructions. Following the course opened by the March 7th instructions, we have sailed against the wind and waves, forged ahead courageously, and achieved one victory after another.

Establishing a Three-in-One Leadership Body as the Command Center for Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions Throughout the School

In the March 7th instructions, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The military should, in batches, conduct military training for universities, middle schools, and high-grade elementary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, reorganizing organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership bodies, and carrying out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation." Through repeated study, we have come to understand that fully implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions means closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution in schools to the end, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois educational system, and establishing a brand-new proletarian educational system. To accomplish this glorious and arduous task, the military training team must not take over and issue orders but must fully mobilize and rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the school. With great enthusiasm, we must help and support them in establishing a powerful three-in-one leadership body—the revolutionary committee—that can lead the revolutionary teachers and students in the school to carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

Based on this understanding, the military training team took helping Yuandan Middle School establish and consolidate the revolutionary committee as the primary task for implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions. We seized the momentum of the March 7th instructions and, on the basis of achieving revolutionary unity throughout the school, quickly realized the revolutionary three-in-one combination. On April 5, 1967, the revolutionary committee was formally established.

When the military training team first entered the school, we were on the front line, directly handling various problems in the school's work. After the school's revolutionary committee was established, we completely withdrew to the second line, focusing our work on "assistance." The school's revolutionary committee directly led the proletarian cultural revolution and various tasks throughout the school. In this way, the revolutionary committee was able to receive training on the leadership position, gradually establish proletarian revolutionary authority in practice, and become the command center for implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions and a series of latest instructions throughout the school. It became the command center for leading the revolutionary teachers and students in the school to carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

In implementing the March 7th instructions, we deeply felt that the greatest support for the newly born revolutionary committee is to thoroughly support its leadership cadre's ideological transformation and arm every member of the revolutionary committee with the great thought of Mao Zedong. We mainly helped the Yuandan Middle School revolutionary committee with three things:

First, grasping the root among countless tasks. After the revolutionary committee was established in April last year, it faced many tasks and many urgent problems that needed to be solved. Among countless tasks, what should be grasped? We followed Chairman Mao's teaching that politics is the commander and the soul, and first armed the commissioners' minds with Mao Zedong Thought. At the first full meeting of the revolutionary committee after its establishment, we suggested that they formulate a system for studying Chairman Mao's works and measures for ideological transformation. It was stipulated that all commissioners must insist on "reading every day," hold a study meeting once a week, and a life meeting once a week, placing the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. The first notice issued by the revolutionary committee called on all revolutionary teachers and students in the school to launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, turning Yuandan Middle School into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. After resuming classes, the first class taught was Mao Zedong Thought. The commissioners and all revolutionary teachers and students fought against selfishness and criticism of revisionism together, consciously transformed their worldviews, and brought the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the school to a new stage. They also held the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the school.

Second, holding large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes to help members of the revolutionary committee overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthen proletarian party spirit. Some members of the Yuandan Middle School revolutionary committee were originally leaders of different mass organizations. After being elected as commissioners of the revolutionary committee, we immediately reminded them not to bring bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism into the revolutionary committee. They should hold power and use power with proletarian party spirit, acting from the interests of the proletariat and the masses, and not from the interests of small groups. The military training team specially helped the members of the revolutionary committee hold five study classes centered on eliminating factionalism. The main members of the revolutionary committee, Meng Qinglin and Yao Tongfa, were originally leaders of two organizations with strong opposing sentiments. After being elected into the revolutionary committee, they often clashed, and neither could stand the sight of the other, affecting their work. To eliminate the factionalism between these two people, we suggested that they enter the Mao Zedong Thought study class. At the beginning, under the control of factionalism, neither of them talked about their own problems but instead picked on each other's faults, making the situation more tense. Facing this situation, we organized them to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on both sides making self-criticisms, guiding them to dig deep into their selfishness and thoroughly expose the harm of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. This made them recognize their shortcomings and sit down calmly to fight against selfishness. One night, they denounced the harm of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism together and decided to unite under the principle of proletarian party spirit. That night, they took an oath in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and formed a "pair of red." Later, Meng Qinglin and Yao Tongfa shared their experiences of fighting against selfishness and eliminating factionalism with all the commissioners and teachers and students in the school. This deeply educated the members of the revolutionary committee and all the teachers and students, launching a tide of holding large-scale study classes and eliminating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism throughout the school.

Third, helping the members of the revolutionary committee improve their leadership style, get close to the masses, and get close to the grassroots, "being both an official and a common person." Most members of the Yuandan Middle School revolutionary committee were selected from the grassroots and had high work enthusiasm and tight work. To solve various problems in the school, their schedules were filled with various meetings. Some commissioners even suggested increasing some staff and adding some on-duty personnel every day. Seeing this situation, the military training team organized the commissioners to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line and leadership methods, introduced the experience of the military leadership organs directly leading the platoons, and helped them improve their leadership style. They overcame the phenomena of floating on the surface and being busy with meetings, adopting the method of commissioners directly connecting with teaching classes. All commissioners went to the masses for face-to-face leadership. To widely listen to the opinions of the masses, the military training team and the school revolutionary committee conducted open rectification many times, accepting the supervision of the broad revolutionary teachers and students. If there were any mistakes, they immediately corrected them.

With the support and help of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, the ideological transformation of the Yuandan Middle School revolutionary committee has been increasingly thorough, and the leadership of implementing the March 7th instructions has been increasingly effective. The facts have proven that only by thoroughly grasping the ideological transformation of the leadership cadre can the revolutionary committee gain the trust of the masses and establish proletarian revolutionary authority.

With the March 7th Instructions as a Weapon, Firmly Grasp the Direction of the Revolutionary Struggle, and Strengthen and Consolidate the Revolutionary Committee in the Struggle Against Various Interferences

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggles.... They will try every day and every hour to restore their rule in China." As Chairman Mao pointed out, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the ghosts and monsters in society are not willing to accept their defeat. They extremely hate the new things supported by Chairman Mao that represent the direction of the revolutionary struggle. After the establishment of the Yuandan Middle School revolutionary committee, they used the anarchist trend of opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything that appeared in society to deceive some people to constantly go to Yuandan Middle School to provoke and challenge. They shouted that the revolutionary great unity of Yuandan Middle School was a "big squeeze," the revolutionary three-in-one combination was a "three mix," and the experience of the educational revolution was reformism. Facing this situation, some students could not calm down, and the revolutionary committee also felt very anxious. Everyone was busy dealing with these provocations, seriously disrupting the school's revolutionary great criticism and educational revolution.

To help the revolutionary committee firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, the military training team organized the members of the revolutionary committee to study Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions again, jointly analyzed the situation, and made everyone clearly understand in their minds that our main enemy is the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev. Our direction of the revolutionary struggle is to carry out the revolutionary great criticism and resume classes for the revolution. Therefore, we must eliminate various interferences and unswervingly advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions, completing all tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school.

After clarifying the direction of the revolutionary struggle, the revolutionary committee, on the one hand, educated all the teachers and students in the school to follow Chairman Mao's instruction of "only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself," correctly treat the deceived masses who came to provoke, and enthusiastically propagandize the March 7th instructions to them, doing a good job of mass work that came to the door. On the other hand, they led all revolutionary teachers and students in the school to launch a magnificent wave of revolutionary great criticism and educational revolution. No matter how big the interference was, it could not shake their determination.

In July and August last year, an ultra-left trend opposing the newly born revolutionary committees appeared in society. A few teachers and students in Yuandan Middle School, under the instigation of a handful of bad elements, also directed their arrows at the revolutionary committee. We believed that the Yuandan Middle School revolutionary committee was established according to revolutionary principles, and the military training team had the responsibility to protect this temporary power organ. Therefore, we mobilized all the teachers and students in the school to discuss the topic "What attitude should be taken towards the newly born revolutionary committee." In the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that the school revolutionary committee represented the fundamental interests of the broad revolutionary teachers and students. In the past few months, it had led the masses to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry out revolutionary great criticism, struggle, criticism, and transformation, defend Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions, and become the locomotive of Yuandan Middle School in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The direction was correct, the work was successful, and the shortcomings and mistakes were only one finger out of ten. It was not allowed to make a big deal out of this one-finger problem and dismantle the revolutionary committee's stage. Once the masses were mobilized, the wrong wind of opposing the revolutionary committee was quickly stopped. At the same time, the military training team actively helped the revolutionary committee correct the shortcomings and mistakes in its work. They suggested that they start from reality and adjust the core forces, making the revolutionary committee more perfect and consolidated.

The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois intellectuals knew that the day of the victory of the proletarian educational revolution was the day they ended their rule over the school. Therefore, when the revolutionary committee led all the teachers and students to launch a magnificent educational revolution, they used every means to use the anarchist thoughts among the students to sabotage, shouting that "Yuandan Middle School must be in great chaos." At this time, we suggested that the revolutionary committee organize the broad revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, analyze and criticize various fallacies opposing the proletarian educational revolution, and expose with facts the evil plots of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party to sabotage the educational revolution. Some classmates who were not clear about the direction of the educational revolution recognized the enemy's plots after exposing them, fought against their selfishness, criticized anarchist thoughts, and consciously stood up to firmly fight against the phenomena of sabotaging the educational revolution. Classmates expressed: Our school is a school that Chairman Mao has personally made remarks on. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud.

In the great storms of class struggle and in the struggle against various interferences, the newly born Yuandan Middle School revolutionary committee has been tempered and become more solid and authoritative in proletarian revolution.

Implementing Political School Construction, Building a Revolutionary Committee That Always Puts Proletarian Politics First, Is the Fundamental Guarantee for Fully Implementing the March 7th Instructions

Chairman Mao said: "The method of sending military cadres to train revolutionary teachers and students is very good. Training and not training are very different. Doing so can learn politics, military affairs, the four firsts, the three-eight style, the three major disciplines and eight points for attention from the PLA, and strengthen organizational discipline." The revolutionary teachers and students throughout the school and the comrades of the military training team repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings and Chairman Mao's brilliant expositions on the proletarian educational revolution. They clearly understood that carrying out the proletarian educational revolution must take Chairman Mao's May 7th instructions and March 7th instructions as the guideline, learn from the PLA, follow the path of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and follow the path of political school construction. The revolutionary teachers and students enthusiastically requested the comrades of the military training team to impart the political work experience of the PLA. They said: If we can master the set of treasures of the PLA's emphasis on proletarian politics, insistence on the four firsts, and the promotion of the three-eight style, we can ensure that the leadership of the school is always in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction; even if the PLA leaves, here will always remain a non-uniformed PLA.

According to the requirements of the revolutionary teachers and students throughout the school, our military training team gave lectures to the school revolutionary committee and various teaching classes on the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and the 1960 resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission on strengthening the political and ideological work of the army. We also lectured on Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's teachings on emphasizing proletarian politics, the glorious tradition of the PLA's political construction of the army, and guided the members of the revolutionary committee and revolutionary teachers and students to hold a great debate on why we should follow the path of political school construction and the relationship between politics and business. In the debate, everyone connected with reality, talked a lot about the bitterness of not emphasizing proletarian politics and the sweetness of emphasizing proletarian politics, and deeply understood that in the past, the school pushed the "first in scores, first in business, first in intelligence, first in admission" line, which was a thorough revisionist educational line. The people trained were only "selfish" bourgeois successors. Only by following the principles of political construction of the army established by Chairman Mao and insisted on by Vice Chairman Lin, learning from the PLA, and carrying out political school construction, can we take the only correct path. This is the necessary path and the path to victory for building a Mao Zedong Thought school.

Through the great debate, the members of the revolutionary committee and revolutionary teachers and students fully understood the profound significance of political school construction. Everyone worked together to learn the political work experience of the PLA, combined with the characteristics of school work, and formulated a plan for political school construction. First, they reformed the school's political work organs, established a political department, abolished the teaching and research groups that emphasized business, changed the grades and classes into companies and platoons, and appointed political instructors in each company. At the same time, they applied the series of effective political work systems of the army, such as insisting on the four firsts, promoting the three-eight style, cultivating excellent companies and soldiers, carrying out "one helps one, one pair of red," daily reading of Chairman Mao's works, and lecture and use meetings, to the school.

To ensure that the school always follows the path of emphasizing proletarian politics and insists on the principle of political school construction, we must first build a revolutionary committee that always emphasizes proletarian politics and cultivate a group of political work cadres. Therefore, the comrades of the military training team used every opportunity to impart ideology, style, and experience to the members of the revolutionary committee and political work personnel. The political commissar of the military training team personally helped the chairman and commissioners of the revolutionary committee learn to do political work. Other comrades of the military training team also adopted the method of "one helps one" to help revolutionary teachers learn to do the work of political instructors.

Through a year of military training work, we deeply understood that Chairman Mao's brilliant March 7th instructions are the guiding light for doing a good job in military and political training, carrying out the proletarian educational revolution, and successfully carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school, seizing the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. As long as we strictly follow the March 7th instructions, we will go from victory to victory! We must seriously study, enthusiastically propagate, resolutely execute, and defend with our lives Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions, let the brilliant March 7th instructions and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and his brilliant educational revolutionary thoughts be fully implemented in Yuandan Middle School, do a better job in military training work, and with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, turn Yuandan Middle School into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    沿着伟大领袖毛主席“三·七”指示开辟的航道胜利前进
    ——支持和帮助天津延安中学革命委员会全面落“三·七”指示的体会
    人民解放军驻天津延安中学军训团
     我们伟大导师毛主席于一九六七年三月七日，对于《天津延安中学以教学班为基础，实现全校大联合和整顿、巩固、发展红卫兵的体会》这个报告，作了有关无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署的著名的“三·七”指示。这一指示象光芒四射的灯塔，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命前进的道路。一年来，我们和延安中学的革命师生一道，全面落实“三·七”指示，沿着
  “三·七”指示开辟的航道乘风破浪，奋勇前进，取得了一个又一个胜利。
      建立三结合领导机关，作为全校
    落实毛主席最新指示的指挥部
    伟大领袖毛主席在“三·七”指示中指出：“军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。”经过反复学习，我们认识到：全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示，就是要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把学校的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底砸烂资产阶级旧的教育制度，建立崭新的无产阶级教育制度。要完成这一光荣而艰巨的任务，军训团绝不能自己包办代替，发号施令，而必须充分地发动和依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，满腔热情地帮助和支持他们建立一个能够领导全校革命师生把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的强有力的三结合领导机关——革命委员会。
    根据这个认识，军训团把帮助延安中学建立和巩固革命委员会做为贯彻执行毛主席“三·七”指示的首要工作来抓。我们大借“三·七”指示的东风，在帮助全校革命师生实现了革命大联合的基础上，迅速实现革命的三结合，于一九六七年四月五日，正式成立了革命委员会。
    我们军训团刚进校的时候，是站在第一线上直接处理学校工作中的各种问题。校革命委员会成立以后，我们全部退到第二线，把工作重点放在“帮”字上，由校革命委员会直接领导全校的无产阶级文化大革命和各项工作。这样，就使革命委员会能够在领导岗位上经受锻炼，在实践中逐步树立无产阶级的革命权威，成为学校里贯彻执行毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的指挥部，成为领导全校革命师生进行斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的指挥部。
    我们在贯彻执行“三·七”指示中深刻地体会到：对新诞生的革命委员会，千支持，万支持，狠抓领导班子的思想革命化，用伟大的毛泽东思想去武装革命委员会的每一个成员，是最大的支持。我们主要帮助延安中学革命委员会做了三件事：
    第一、千头万绪抓根本。去年四月份革命委员会成立后，面临着许多工作，许多急待解决的问题。千头万绪抓什么？我们遵照毛主席政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，首先用毛泽东思想武装委员们的头脑。在革命委员会成立后的第一次全体会议上，我们就建议他们制订学习毛主席著作的制度和实现思想革命化的措施，规定全体委员对毛主席著作必须坚持“天天读”，一周一次学习会，一周一次生活会，把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。革命委员会发出的第一号通告，就号召全校革命师生掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，把延安中学办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。复课后，开的第一门课就是毛泽东思想课。委员们和全校革命师生一起斗私批修，自觉地改造自己的世界观，使全校活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了新局面，并召开了全校首届学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。
    第二、大办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助革命委员会成员克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。延安中学革命委员会有些成员，是原来不同观点的群众组织的头头。他们被选为革命委员会委员以后，我们立即提醒他们，不能把资产阶级、小资产阶级派性带到革命委员会里来，要以无产阶级党性掌好权，用好权，事事从无产阶级和人民大众的利益出发，而不能从小团体的利益出发。军训团特别帮助革命委员会成员举办了五期以围剿派性为中心的学习班。革命委员会主要成员孟庆林和姚同发，原来是两个对立情绪很大的组织的头头，被选入革命委员会以后，经常顶顶撞撞，谁看谁也不顺眼，影响了工作。为了消除这两个人的派性，我们建议他们进毛泽东思想学习班。开始，在派性的支配下，他们谁也不谈自己的问题，而是互相挑毛病，越闹越僵。针对这种情况，我们组织他们反复学习毛主席关于双方要各自多做自我批评的最新指示，引导他们多挖自己的私心，大摆资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的危害，使他们认识到自己的缺点，冷静地坐下来斗私。有一天晚上，他们在一起控诉了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的危害，决心在无产阶级党性的原则下团结起来。当天晚上，他们就在毛主席像前宣誓，结成了“一对红”。后来，孟庆林和姚同发向全体委员和全校师生介绍了他们狠斗私心，围剿派性的体会，使革命委员会成员和全体师生受到了深刻的教育，从而在全校掀起了一个大办学习班，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的热潮。
    第三、帮助革命委员会成员改进领导作风，深入群众，深入基层，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”。延安中学革命委员会的成员大部分是从基层选拔上来的，他们工作热情很高，工作抓得很紧。为了解决学校里的各种问题，日程表上排满了各种会议。有的委员还建议，增加一些办事人员，每天增加一些值班的。军训团看到这种情况，组织委员们学习了毛主席关于群众路线和关于领导方法的教导，向他们介绍了解放军领导机关对连队实行面对面领导的经验，帮助他们改进了领导作风，克服了浮在上面和忙于开会的现象，采取了委员与教学班直接挂钩的办法，所有的委员都到群众中去，进行面对面的领导。为了广泛地听取群众的意见，军训团和校革命委员会多次进行开门整风，接受广大革命师生的监督，有了错误，立即改正。
    在广大革命师生的支持、帮助下，延安中学革命委员会思想革命化的程度越来越高，领导落实“三·七”指示也越来越得力了。事实证明：只有狠抓领导班子的思想革命化，革命委员会才会取得群众的信任，才会树立起无产阶级革命权威。
      以“三·七”指示为武器，紧紧掌
  握革命斗争的大方向，在同各种干扰斗
  争中加强和巩固革命委员会
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。……他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”正如毛主席指出的那样，党内一小撮走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神是不甘心于他们的失败的，他们对毛主席支持的代表革命斗争大方向的新生事物极端仇视。在延安中学革命委员会建立以后，他们利用社会上出现的一股反对一切、排斥一切、打倒一切的无政府主义思潮，蒙蔽一些人天天到延安中学去冲击、挑衅。他们叫嚷，延安中学的革命大联合是“大捏合”，革命三结合是“三凑合”，教育革命的经验是改良主义。面对这种情况，有些学生沉不住气了，革命委员会也感到很着急。大家忙于应付这些冲击，使学校的革命大批判和教育革命受到了严重的干扰。
    为了帮助革命委员会牢牢掌握斗争大方向，军训团再次组织革命委员会成员学习毛主席的“三·七”指示，共同分析了形势，使大家从思想上明确地认识到，我们最主要的敌人是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，我们的革命斗争大方向是搞革命大批判和复课闹革命。因此，我们一定要排除各种干扰，坚定不移地沿着毛主席“三·七”指示指引的方向，奋勇前进，彻底完成学校斗、批、改的各项任务。
    明确了革命斗争的大方向以后，革命委员会一方面教育全校师生遵循毛主席“实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导”的指示，正确对待受了蒙蔽前来冲击的群众，满腔热情地向他们宣传“三·七”指示，做好送上门来的群众工作；一方面，领导全校革命师生，掀起一个波澜壮阔的革命大批判和教育革命的高潮，不管干扰多大，都动摇不了他们的决心。
    去年七、八月份，社会上出现了一股反对新生的革命委员会的极“左”思潮。延安中学内少数师生，在一小撮坏人的挑拨下，也把矛头指向了革命委员会。我们认为，延安中学的革命委员会，是按照革命的原则建立起来的，军训团有责任保卫这个临时权力机构。于是我们发动全校师生，以“对待新生的革命委员会应该抱什么态度”为题，展开了一次讨论。在讨论中，大家一致认为校革命委员会代表了广大革命师生的根本利益，几个月以来，它带领群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，开展革命大批判，进行斗、批、改，捍卫了毛主席的“三·七”指示，成为延安中学执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的火车头，大方向是正确的，工作是有成绩的，缺点和错误只不过是十个指头中的一个指头。绝不允许借这一个指头的问题大作文章，拆革命委员会的台。群众一发动起来，反对革命委员会的歪风很快就被煞住了。同时，军训团积极帮助革命委员会纠正工作中的缺点和错误。建议他们从实际出发，调整了骨干力量，使革命委员会更加完善和巩固。
    党内一小撮走资派和反动的资产阶级知识分子知道：无产阶级教育革命胜利之日，就是他们统治学校结束之时。因此，在革命委员会领导全体师生轰轰烈烈开展教育革命的时候，他们又千方百计利用学生中的无政府主义思想来进行破坏，叫嚷什么“延安中学必须大乱特乱”。这时，我们又建议革命委员会组织广大革命师生学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，分析和批判了各种反对无产阶级教育革命的谬论，并用事实揭露了党内一小撮走资派破坏教育革命的罪恶阴谋。一些原来对教育革命大方向认识不清的同学，在识破了敌人阴谋之后，狠斗了自己的私心，批判了无政府主义思想，自觉地站出来同破坏教育革命的现象做坚决斗争。同学们纷纷表示：我们的学校是毛主席亲自作过批示的学校，毛主席给我们撑腰，我们一定要给毛主席争气。
    在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，在同各种干扰进行斗争的过程中，新生的延安中学革命委员会锻炼得更加坚强、更有无产阶级革命权威了。
      实行政治建校，建设一个永远突出
    无产阶级政治的革命委员会，是全面落
    实“三·七”指示的根本保证
    毛主席说：“派军队干部训练革命师生的方法很好。训练一下和不训练大不一样。这样做，可以向解放军学政治，学军事，学四个第一，学三八作风，学三大纪律八项注意，加强组织纪律性。”全校革命师生和军训团的同志反复学习了毛主席的这一教导和毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的光辉论述，明确地认识到，进行无产阶级教育革命必须以毛主席的“五
  ·七”指示和“三·七”指示为指针，大学解放军，走抗大的道路，走政治建校的道路。革命师生们热情地要求军训团的同志传授解放军的政治工作经验。他们说：把解放军突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风这一套法宝学到手，就能保证学校的领导权永远掌握在无产阶级革命派手中；就是解放军走了，这里仍会永远留下一支不穿军装的解放军。
    根据全校革命师生的要求，我们军训团向校革命委员会和各教学班，大讲古田会议决议、一九六○年《中共中央军委扩大会议关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》，大讲毛主席和林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的教导，大讲人民解放军政治建军的光荣传统。同时，引导革命委员会成员和革命师生开展了为什么要走政治建校的道路以及政治和业务的关系的大辩论。在辩论中，大家联系实际，大讲不突出无产阶级政治的苦头和突出无产阶级政治的甜头，深刻认识到，过去学校里推行“分数第一，业务第一，智育第一，升学第一”，是地地道道的修正主义教育路线；培养出来的人，只能是“私”字当头的资产阶级接班人。只有按照毛主席创立的、林副主席坚持的政治建军原则，学习解放军，进行政治建校，才是唯一正确的道路。这是建设毛泽东思想大学校的必由之路，胜利之路。
    通过大辩论，革命委员会的成员和革命师生充分地认识了政治建校的深远意义。大家一起动手，学习解放军的政治工作经验，结合学校工作的特点，制订了政治建校的方案。首先，改革了学校的政治工作机构，设立了政治处，取消了突出业务的教研组，把各年级和班改为连、排，并在各连配备了政治指导员。同时，把部队坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，培养四好连队、五好战士，开展“一帮一、一对红”，以及天天读毛主席著作、开讲用会等一系列行之有效的政治工作制度，运用到学校中去。
    要保证学校永远走突出无产阶级政治的道路，坚持政治建校的原则，首先必须建设一个永远突出无产阶级政治的革命委员会，培养一批政治工作的骨干力量。因此，军训团的同志利用一切机会向革命委员会成员和政治工作人员传思想，传作风，传经验。军训团政委亲自帮助革命委员会主任和委员们学会做政治工作。军训团的其他同志也采取一帮一的办法，帮助革命教师学会做政治指导员的工作。
    通过一年来的军训工作，使我们深深认识到，毛主席的光辉的“三·七”指示，是搞好军政训练，开展无产阶级教育革命，胜利地进行学校的斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指路明灯。只要我们不折不扣地照“三·七”指示办事，就会从胜利走向胜利！我们一定要认真学习、热情宣传、坚决执行、誓死捍卫毛主席的“三·七”指示，让光芒四射的“三·七”指示，让毛主席的一系列最新指示和他老人家的光辉的教育革命思想，在延安中学全面落实，把军训工作搞得更好，誓与广大革命师生一道，把延安中学办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
