Revolutionary women from various countries in Beijing enthusiastically hail the new era of Mao Zedong Thought on the eve of International Women's Day. They declare that learning and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the historical mission of revolutionary women from all countries. They call on all to join the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, to strive for revolutionary victory and women's liberation.

They expressed their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. They said, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people and women of the world. Chairman Mao cares most about the world revolution and the cause of women's liberation. The revolutionary people and women of the world sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life! A long life!"

New China News Agency, March 7th: On the eve of International Women's Day, revolutionary women from various countries in Beijing spoke to our reporter, enthusiastically hailing the new era of revolution under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. They said, "Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the revolutionary people and women of the world, the red sun in their hearts. Chairman Mao cares most about the world revolution and the cause of women's liberation. The revolutionary people and women of the world sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life! A long life!"

A ship needs a helmsman to navigate the seas, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. The women from various countries said in their discussions, "In the great era of Mao Zedong Thought, the historical mission of revolutionary women from all countries is to strive to learn and master the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they should actively engage in the fiery revolutionary struggle, oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, strive for national liberation and revolutionary victory, and thereby achieve women's liberation."

Thai friend Nida said in her discussion, "In the great era of Mao Zedong Thought, women of the world who seek liberation must rely on Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the measure of whether one is a true revolutionary or a false one. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, has made China, the world's revolutionary base, even more solid and powerful. It will provide even stronger support for the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. The revolutionary people of the world feel extremely fortunate to have such a great leader as Chairman Mao. The Thai people and women love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought from the bottom of their hearts."

Nida said, "The great leader Chairman Mao once said, 'When all women rise up, it will be the day of victory for the Chinese revolution.' Chairman Mao's teaching fully applies to the situation in Thailand. Under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Thai women have come to realize that armed struggle is the only path to liberation for the Thai people. They actively participate in the people's war to overthrow the Thanon-Praphas regime, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism. They have played a significant role in the Thai people's war and have become an indispensable force. Especially in the guerrilla areas, women not only undertake combat tasks but also take on medical, transportation, propaganda, and mobilization work. Revolutionary struggle has completely transformed the spiritual face of Thai women. Their new awakening marks a new development in the Thai revolution."

Nida said, "The reason Thai women can play such a great role is inseparable from their arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. In the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth anniversary proclamations of the Thai Communist Party, it was called upon to study the works of Chairman Mao. Now the revolutionary people of Thailand are all actively studying the works of Chairman Mao. Many rural women can recite 'Three Constantly Read Articles' and some sayings of Chairman Mao. Even in enemy-occupied areas, revolutionary people bravely study the works of Chairman Mao despite numerous difficulties. We are full of confidence that the Thai revolution, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely achieve victory."

Indonesian friend Darmini praised, "Our era is the era of Mao Zedong Thought, an era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. The great Mao Zedong Thought has become a powerful weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to defeat their enemies—imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and reactionaries in various countries. Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the people and women of the world will achieve thorough liberation and march towards a bright future—socialism and communism."

Darmini said, "The characteristic of this year's International Women's Day is the rise of women around the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is the rise of women in the era of Mao Zedong Thought. Now, the people's armed struggles are surging in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and revolutionary people and women are flocking to the revolutionary path. The parliamentary road or 'peaceful road' advocated by Soviet modern revisionism and the Chinese Khrushchev has been fundamentally bankrupt. The oppressed peoples and nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are increasingly realizing that the only path to national liberation is the path of 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' relying on the peasants, establishing revolutionary bases in the countryside, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and finally seizing the cities."

Darmini said, "Indonesian women and revolutionary people have realized that the struggle for women's liberation is inseparable from the struggle for national liberation, which is armed people's struggle. Chairman Mao's teaching on 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' has inspired Indonesian revolutionary people and women. They are resolutely fighting against the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution, which is supported by U.S. imperialism and colludes with Soviet modern revisionism. Indonesian revolutionary women are making all their activities serve the armed struggle of the Indonesian people. They deeply understand that 'without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people,' and only by waging a people's war can a free and democratic Indonesia be established. Now, Indonesian women warriors in the countryside are combining with the poor peasant masses, together with their comrades-in-arms, mobilizing the masses, arming the masses, and fighting bravely against the enemy."

She said, "Indonesian revolutionary people and women overcome all difficulties and obstacles, placing the study of Chairman Mao's works in the highest position, insisting on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. Indonesian revolutionary people and women love Chairman Mao very much; they regard Chairman Mao as their great teacher and savior. In some places, young women and revolutionary youth together actively establish groups to spread Mao Zedong Thought, regarding the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as their glorious mission. In prisons and detention camps, revolutionary fighters study the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, turning prisons and detention camps into places to study Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, they become stronger and stronger, 'determined to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory.'"

Mrs. Shirley Graham, the wife of the famous American black leader W.E.B. Du Bois, who had been received by Chairman Mao, enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao for developing Marxism-Leninism to a new level, and Mao Zedong Thought for pushing the world revolutionary struggle to a new level. She said that she came from Africa and personally felt that the African people love Chairman Mao very much. In many places in Africa, she saw the precious book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong."

Graham said, "Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought on 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' the revolutionary armed struggles of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples are developing vigorously. She especially talked about the awakening of the African people and American blacks, saying that the African people and American blacks are gradually realizing that they must wage armed struggle to achieve national and people's liberation."

Graham said, "The African people are increasingly seeing clearly that the Soviet modern revisionists have betrayed them. The Soviet modern revisionists want the African people not to struggle, saying things like 'wait for negotiations' and 'peaceful coexistence.' The African people know very clearly that all this is nonsense."

Based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "all the people of the world, unite! Oppose the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys!" Graham called on the African people and African women to unite, be determined, fear no sacrifice, and fight bravely to defeat imperialism and old and new colonialism.

Japanese friend Tokuzo Tetsuda said in her discussion, "At this time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is striving for comprehensive victory in China, welcoming International Women's Day has special significance. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has greatly promoted the revolutionary struggles of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples. The Japanese revolutionary people highly evaluate this revolution and strongly support it."

Tokuzo Tetsuda said, "The most beloved great leader Chairman Mao of the world people cares about the struggles of the Japanese people and firmly supports them. Since 1960, Chairman Mao has made four extremely important speeches supporting the struggles of the Japanese people. Chairman Mao said, 'U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese people,' 'The Japanese people are a great people. They will never allow U.S. imperialism to ride on their heads for long.' Chairman Mao's teachings have illuminated the revolutionary path of the Japanese people, giving the Japanese people and women boundless strength. The Japanese people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, direct their main struggle against U.S. imperialism."

Tokuzo Tetsuda said, "The Japanese people love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought boundlessly. The Japanese revolutionary leftists hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They regard 'Three Constantly Read Articles' as their motto. Tokuzo Tetsuda, who is already 71 years old, expressed her determination to strive to learn and master Mao Zedong Thought. She said that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary struggles of the Japanese people will definitely achieve greater victories and ultimate victory."

Brazilian friend Largo Gessoy said in her discussion, "First of all, I wish our great leader Chairman Mao a long life! A long life! She said, 'Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the world people. Chairman Mao's wise leadership determines not only the destiny of China but also the destiny of the world.'

Gessoy said, "I have seen with my own eyes that in China, from cities to villages, from factories to offices and schools, women are all striving to study the works of Chairman Mao, actively responding to Chairman Mao's great call to 'care about state affairs' and 'carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end,' striving to make contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. She said that the brave revolutionary struggles of Chinese women armed with Mao Zedong Thought are a great encouragement to women all over the world. Today, the revolutionary winds of China blow across the world, and the revolutionary storms of people's wars sweep through Asia, Africa, and Latin America. People in the struggle deeply realize that they must strive to study the works of Chairman Mao and, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, seize the victory of the revolutionary struggle."

She said, "Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of revolutionary people in various countries. Now, in Latin America, more and more people and mass organizations are forming study groups to study 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong,' 'Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong,' and 'Three Constantly Read Articles.' More and more women in Latin America, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have taken up arms and joined the armed struggle, striving for complete national liberation."

Gessoy said, "In Latin America, it is necessary to widely propagate Mao Zedong Thought and drive out the influence of modern revisionism before the revolutionary high tide can come. She pointed out that China's experience of seizing political power through long-term armed struggle is especially precious for the peoples of Latin American countries, especially the Brazilian people. The Brazilian people must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, establish a Marxist-Leninist party, establish an army led by this party, wage armed struggle, and take the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside. Only in this way can they achieve thorough revolutionary victory."

She said, "The most important task for women in Latin American countries at present is to spread Mao Zedong Thought to various countries, turning them into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought, so that the women there, like Chinese women, can follow the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and take the revolutionary path, making contributions to the proletarian revolution in Latin America."

Tanzanian friends Aisha and Suleyman shared their experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works. They praised Chairman Mao as the great leader of the world revolutionary people, and Mao Zedong Thought as the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the most scientific summary of contemporary revolutionary experience. They said that any country's people and nations, to achieve independence and liberation, must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and engage in revolutionary struggles.

They said, "Women from various countries can only achieve liberation by following Chairman Mao's teachings, engaging in the struggle for national and people's liberation, and joining the ranks of the struggle for liberation. In the struggle for liberation, people of all nationalities and women must help and support each other."

Aisha and Suleyman said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader Chairman Mao not only consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat in China but also made great contributions to the world revolution. China has become the base of the world revolution. Every victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great encouragement to the people and women of the world. It will further promote the revolutionary struggles of the people and women of various countries in the world."

The revolutionary friends from various countries also conveyed the respect of women from various countries to Chinese revolutionary women, wishing Chinese women to make greater contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They paid tribute to the heroic Vietnamese women fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle and called on revolutionary women from various countries to unite and fight for greater victories.

    在京各国革命妇女“三八”节前夕热烈欢呼世界进入毛泽东思想新时代
    学习和掌握毛泽东思想是各国革命妇女的历史使命
    投入反对帝修反的战斗争取革命胜利争取妇女解放
    她们热情地表达了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。她们说，毛主席是世界革命人民和妇女心中的红太阳。毛主席最关心世界革命和妇女的解放事业，世界革命人民和妇女衷心地敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    新华社七日讯　“三八”国际劳动妇女节前夕，在北京的各国革命妇女向本社记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的革命新时代，热情地表达了她们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。她们说，毛主席是世界革命人民和妇女的伟大导师，是世界革命人民和妇女心中的红太阳。毛主席最关心世界革命和妇女的解放事业，世界革命人民和妇女衷心地敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。各国妇女在谈话中说，在伟大的毛泽东思想时代里，各国革命妇女的历史使命，就是要努力学习和掌握战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在毛泽东思想指引下，积极投身于火热的革命斗争中，反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，争取民族的解放和革命的胜利，从而取得妇女的解放。
    泰国朋友妮达在谈话中说，在世界进入伟大的毛泽东思想时代里，世界妇女要求得解放必须依靠毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，对待毛泽东思想的态度是衡量真革命还是假革命的尺度。由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，使中国这个世界革命根据地更加巩固、更加强大，将更有力地支援世界人民的革命斗争。世界革命人民以有毛主席这样伟大的领袖感到无比幸福。泰国人民和妇女从内心里无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想。
    妮达说，伟大领袖毛主席曾经说：“全国妇女起来之日，就是中国革命胜利之时。”毛主席的教导完全符合泰国情况。泰国妇女在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的泰国共产党领导下，认识到武装斗争是泰国人民争取解放的唯一道路，积极参加推翻美帝国主义的走狗他侬—巴博集团的人民战争。她们在泰国人民战争中发挥了很大作用，成为一支不可缺少的力量。特别是游击区的妇女，她们不仅担负着战斗任务，还负责医疗、运输、宣传和发动群众的工作。革命斗争使泰国妇女的精神面貌焕然一新。她们的新觉醒标志着泰国革命的新发展。
    妮达说，泰国妇女所以能发挥如此巨大作用，是和她们用毛泽东思想武装自己分不开的。泰国共产党在成立二十四周年和二十五周年的文告中，都号召人民学习毛主席著作。现在泰国革命人民都积极学习毛主席著作，不少农村妇女都能背诵“老三篇”和毛主席的一些语录，就连敌占区的革命人民，也冲破重重困难，热情学习毛主席著作。我们满怀信心，泰国革命在毛泽东思想指引下，一定能获得胜利。
    印度尼西亚朋友达尔米妮赞颂说，我们的时代是毛泽东思想的时代，是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。伟大的毛泽东思想已成为全世界革命人民战胜敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的强大武器。在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，全世界人民和妇女将取得彻底的解放，走向光辉灿烂的未来——社会主义和共产主义。
    达尔米妮说，今年国际妇女节的特征是全世界妇女，特别是亚非拉妇女的奋起。这是在毛泽东思想时代的妇女的奋起。现在亚非拉地区人民武装斗争风起云涌，革命人民和妇女纷纷走上革命的道路。苏联现代修正主义和中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的议会道路或“和平道路”已遭到根本的破产。亚非拉各国被压迫人民和被压迫民族日益认识到，走向民族解放的唯一道路，就是“枪杆子里面出政权”的道路，依靠农民，在农村建立革命根据地，以农村包围城市，最后占领城市的道路。
    达尔米妮说，印尼妇女和革命人民认识到，争取妇女解放的斗争，是同争取祖国解放斗争即武装的人民斗争，分不开的。毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，鼓舞了印尼革命人民和妇女，他们正在同得到美帝国主义支持、同苏联现代修正主义勾结的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权进行坚决的斗争。印尼革命妇女正在使她们的一切活动为印尼人民的武装斗争服务。她们深刻地认识到，“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”，只有进行人民战争，才能建立一个自由和民主的印尼。现在，印尼妇女战士在农村同贫农群众相结合，同她们的战友一起，发动群众，武装群众，同敌人进行英勇的战斗。
    她说，印尼革命人民和妇女排除一切困难和障碍，把学习毛主席著作，放在高于一切的地位，坚持用毛泽东思想统帅一切。印尼革命人民和妇女非常热爱毛主席，他们把毛主席看作是他们的伟大导师和救星。在一些地方，青年妇女和革命青年一起，积极地成立传播毛泽东思想的小组，把宣传毛泽东思想当作自己的光荣任务。在监狱和拘留营里，革命战士学习战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把监狱和拘留营变成了学习毛泽东思想的场所。这样，他们就变得越来越坚强，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    曾经受到毛主席接见的美国著名黑人领袖杜波依斯的夫人歇莉·格雷姆在谈话中，热烈赞扬伟大领袖毛主席把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段，毛泽东思想把世界革命斗争推进到一个新的水平。她说，她从非洲来，亲身感受到非洲人民非常热爱毛主席，在非洲许多地方看到有《毛主席语录》这本宝书。
    格雷姆说，在毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的思想指引下，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命武装斗争正在蓬勃发展。她特别谈到了非洲人民和美国黑人的觉醒，她说，非洲人民和美国黑人逐渐认识到，他们必须进行武装斗争，才能取得民族和人民的解放。
    格雷姆说，非洲人民越来越清楚地看到，苏联现代修正主义者背叛了他们。苏联现代修正主义者要非洲人民不要斗争，说什么要“等待谈判”，要“和平共处”。非洲人民清楚地知道他们的这一套是胡说八道。
    格雷姆根据毛主席关于“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗”的教导，呼吁非洲人民和非洲妇女，团结起来，下定决心，不怕牺牲，前赴后继，为打败帝国主义和新老殖民主义而战斗。
    日本朋友德田多津在谈话中说，在中国无产阶级文化大革命争取全面胜利的时候迎接“三八”国际劳动妇女节，具有特别重要的意义。史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，大大推动了亚非拉人民的革命斗争，日本革命人民高度评价这场革命，并且热烈支持这场革命。
    德田多津说，世界人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席非常关怀日本人民的斗争，并且给予坚决支持。从一九六○年以来，毛主席四次发表支持日本人民斗争的极为重要的谈话。毛主席说：“美帝国主义是日本民族的最凶恶的敌人”，“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”毛主席的这些教导照亮了日本人民革命的道路，给日本人民和妇女增加了无穷力量。日本人民按照毛主席的教导，把斗争的主要矛头对准美帝国主义。
    德田多津说，日本人民无限热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想。日本革命左派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，他们把“老三篇”作为座右铭。已经七十一岁的德田多津表示一定要努力学习和掌握毛泽东思想。她说，在毛泽东思想的指引下，日本人民的革命斗争一定会取得更大的胜利，取得最后的胜利。
    巴西朋友拉戈尔·格索依在谈话中，首先祝愿我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！她说，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界人民的伟大领袖。毛主席的英明领导既决定着中国的命运，也决定着世界的命运。
    格索依说，我亲眼看到，在中国从城市到乡村，从工厂到机关和学校，妇女都在努力学习毛主席著作，积极响应毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，努力为无产阶级文化大革命作出贡献。她说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的新中国妇女所进行的英勇的革命斗争，对全世界的妇女是个极大的鼓舞。今天，中国革命的劲风吹遍全世界，人民战争的革命风暴席卷亚非拉。斗争中的各国人民深刻地认识到，必须努力学习毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想指引下夺取革命斗争的胜利。
    她说，毛泽东思想是各国革命人民反帝反修斗争的强大思想武器。现在拉丁美洲有越来越多的人和群众团体组成学习小组，学习《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》、《毛泽东军事文选》和“老三篇”。拉丁美洲有越来越多的妇女，在毛泽东思想指引下，拿起了武器，参加了武装斗争，争取民族彻底解放。
    格索依说，在拉丁美洲必须广泛地宣传毛泽东思想，驱除现代修正主义的影响，革命高潮才能到来。她指出，中国通过长期的武装斗争取得政权的经验，对拉丁美洲各国人民特别是巴西人民来说特别宝贵。巴西人民必须按照毛主席的教导，建立马克思列宁主义的党，建立一支由这个党领导的军队，开展武装斗争，走农村包围城市的道路。这样才能取得革命的彻底胜利。
    她说，拉丁美洲各国妇女当前最重要的任务，就是把毛泽东思想传播到各国去，把那里办成毛泽东思想的大学校，使那里的妇女象中国妇女一样，在毛泽东思想指引下，走上革命道路，为拉丁美洲无产阶级革命作出贡献。
    坦桑尼亚朋友阿霞和苏莱娅畅谈了她们学习毛主席著作的心得。她们称颂毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖，赞颂毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是当代革命经验最科学的总结。她们说，任何国家的人民和民族，要取得独立和解放，就必须遵照毛主席的教导进行革命斗争。
    她们说，各国妇女只有遵照毛主席的教导，通过斗争，投身于民族和人民解放斗争的行列，才能获得解放。在争取解放的斗争中，各民族人民和妇女都要互相帮助，互相支援。
    阿霞和苏莱娅说，伟大领袖毛主席领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，不仅巩固了中国无产阶级专政，也为世界革命作出了巨大的贡献，中国已成为世界革命的基地。中国无产阶级文化大革命的每一个胜利，都是对世界人民和妇女的巨大鼓舞，它必将进一步促进世界各国人民和妇女的革命斗争。
    各国革命朋友在谈话中还转达了各国妇女对中国革命妇女的敬意，祝愿中国妇女在无产阶级文化大革命中作出更大贡献。她们向战斗在抗美斗争最前线的英雄越南妇女致敬，并且呼吁各国革命妇女团结起来进行战斗，争取更大的胜利。
