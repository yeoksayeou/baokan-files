The revolutionary masses of Zhejiang Province, with three thousand one hundred million heroes, are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and warmly celebrate the raising of a brilliant red flag on the eastern coast of the motherland—the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee was born in the stormy weather of class struggle. Along the Qiantang River, in the Yandang Mountain area, on the islands scattered in the East China Sea, and on the fertile Hangjiahu Plain, these days are filled with a joyous atmosphere. People from all walks of life, including workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres, are holding various celebrations to celebrate the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province. People shout with all their might: "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

"Following Chairman Mao is victory!" The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Zhejiang Province, while celebrating the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, reviewed the more than one-year-long battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They deeply felt that every achievement they had made was the result of closely following the great commander Chairman Mao, and it was the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They said, the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao's affectionate care and timely guidance for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province, especially Chairman Mao's personal inspection of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang last year, will forever be engraved in the hearts of the three thousand one hundred million people of the province. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and advance bravely in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

At the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Xinghua, South Lake, the poor and lower-middle peasants of South Lake Brigade held a celebration meeting to celebrate the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee. They said, forty-seven years ago, the great leader Chairman Mao came to South Lake and personally ignited the blazing fire of the Chinese revolution, which spread throughout China and illuminated the world, saving us from the deep water and fiery hell of the old society. Today, the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally ignited by him has pushed the Chinese revolution to a new stage. We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the great leader Chairman Mao closely, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and ensure that the proletarian iron mountain of the great motherland remains unshakable for thousands of years.

While celebrating the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, revolutionary masses from all over the province once again studied the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," and further heightened their revolutionary vigilance. They said, Zhejiang is located on the front line of coastal defense, where class struggle is sharp and complex. The establishment of the revolutionary committee does not mean the end of class struggle, but rather the starting point of a new struggle. We must, under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, continue to consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly expose and criticize the revisionist line of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique headed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions. The people of Mayi Island People's Commune expressed that they would, under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp class struggle, thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of the "three autonomies and one contract" and other revisionist black goods pushed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Mayi Island, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in the sky of Mayi Island.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in the province, while celebrating the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the three armies stationed in Zhejiang in the "three supports and two militaries" work. They expressed that they would more firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, support and love the PLA, help the PLA do a good job in the "three supports and two militaries" work, carry out military support activities on a larger scale, further strengthen military-civilian unity, and build an indestructible steel wall on the front line of the motherland's East China Sea to defend the great socialist motherland and the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    浙江省革命群众欢呼省革委会在急风暴雨中诞生
    狠抓阶级斗争　永保江山不变色
    新华社杭州二十八日电　浙江省三千一百万英雄儿女满怀革命豪情，热烈欢呼在祖国的东海之滨树起了一面鲜艳的红旗——浙江省革命委员会在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中胜利诞生。在钱塘江畔，在雁荡山区，在东海中星罗棋布的岛屿上，在富饶的杭嘉湖平原，这几天到处是一片欢腾景象。各地广大工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将和革命干部纷纷举行各种庆祝活动，热烈庆祝无产阶级文化大革命在浙江省取得的决定性胜利。人们千遍万遍地振臂高呼：“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”
  “战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
      “紧跟毛主席就是胜利！”浙江省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在欢呼省革命委员会成立的时候，回顾一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，深深体会到他们所取得的每一个成就，都是紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的结果，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。他们说，伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席对浙江省无产阶级文化大革命的亲切关怀和及时指导，特别是毛主席去年亲临浙江视察无产阶级文化大革命，将永远铭刻在全省三千一百万人民的心坎上。我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中奋勇前进！在中国共产党第一次全国代表大会会址的嘉兴南湖，南湖大队的贫下中农为庆祝省革委会成立举行了庆祝大会。他们说，四十七年前伟大领袖毛主席来到南湖亲手点燃的中国革命的燎原烈火，燃遍了全中国，照亮了全世界，把我们从水深火热的旧社会中拯救了出来。今天他老人家亲手点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，又把中国革命推向了一个新的阶段。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证伟大祖国无产阶级的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色。
    在欢庆省革命委员会成立的时候，各地广大革命群众再一次学习了伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，更加百倍地提高革命警惕性。他们说，浙江地处海防前线，阶级斗争尖锐复杂，革命委员会的建立决不意味着阶级斗争的结束，而是新的斗争的起点。我们一定要在省革命委员会的领导下，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争，彻底粉碎一小撮叛徒、美蒋特务、反革命分子和死不悔改的走资派以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右的一切反革命破坏活动。一定要牢牢掌握斗争大方向，继续巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，深入开展革命的大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在浙江的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线揭深批透，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。蚂蚁岛人民公社的广大渔民表示，要在省革命委员会的领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在蚂蚁岛推行的“三自一包”等反革命修正主义黑货的流毒，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在蚂蚁岛上空永远飘扬。
    全省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在欢庆省革命委员会成立的日子里，热情赞颂人民解放军驻浙三军在“三支”“两军”工作中创建的丰功伟绩。他们表示，要更加坚决相信和依靠人民解放军，拥护和热爱解放军，帮助解放军做好“三支”“两军”工作，要更大规模地开展拥军活动，进一步加强军民团结，在祖国东海前哨筑起一道坚不可摧的钢铁长城，保卫伟大的社会主义祖国，保卫伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。
