The entire nation of a billion people enthusiastically acclaims the revolutionary committees!

Chairman Mao's brilliant directive on the three-in-one combination has pointed the way for the construction of revolutionary committees.

In the midst of striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of soldiers and civilians are determined to study, propagate, and implement Chairman Mao's latest directive earnestly, enthusiastically, and swiftly. They will build the revolutionary committees into battle command posts that are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, revolutionary, and closely linked with the masses. They will always be vigilant and expose the plots of class enemies who attempt to undermine and overthrow the revolutionary committees from the right or the "ultra-left."

New China News Agency, March 30th: The important editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good," published in the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily, conveys our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive: "The basic experience of revolutionary committees has three aspects: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination in the revolution. Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline personnel, and organize a revolutionary, mass-linked leadership cadre." This great news spread across the country, and the entire nation rejoiced. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses enthusiastically acclaim Chairman Mao's brilliant latest directive, which has pointed the way for the construction of revolutionary committees and provided an immense fighting force for the billion revolutionary masses striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They enthusiastically acclaim, "Revolutionary committees are good!" They enthusiastically acclaim, "Long live the great thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Revolutionary masses in various places are extremely excited and say that one year ago, when the revolutionary committees, this new thing, just appeared on the eastern horizon, our great leader Chairman Mao, with his great genius as a proletarian revolutionary, foresaw and pointed out: "In places and units where power needs to be seized, the policy of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power organ. The name of this power organ is good to be called the revolutionary committee." Over the past year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great directive, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved one great victory after another. On the vast land of our motherland, the red flags of revolutionary committees have appeared and fluttered in the wind. In this unprecedentedly good situation, Chairman Mao has issued a new battle cry to us, which is the greatest encouragement, greatest education, greatest support, and greatest spur to us. We must study it earnestly, propagate it enthusiastically, implement it swiftly, and execute it resolutely. We will build the revolutionary committees into battle command posts that are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, revolutionary, and closely linked with the masses. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, we will achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the capital, as soon as the editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good" was broadcast, the broad revolutionary masses spread the news enthusiastically and acclaimed Chairman Mao's latest directive. Some members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and standing committee members of the agricultural representatives' conference immediately went to the masses and to the poor and lower-middle peasants to enthusiastically propagate Chairman Mao's latest directive and the spirit of the editorial. Many representatives attending the conference of active learners and propagandists of Chairman Mao's works among Beijing's middle school Red Guards today discussed in a study session, combining the good situation in their schools after the establishment of revolutionary committees, extolling the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest directive, and enumerating the good points of revolutionary committees. Revolutionary workers and supporting military personnel of the Beijing Railway Bureau's Guang'anmen District's six units held a grand meeting to enthusiastically acclaim and celebrate the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. After the meeting, some members of the revolutionary committee and some revolutionary masses and supporting military personnel held a discussion. They said that Chairman Mao's latest brilliant directive struck a chord in their hearts. Revolutionary committees are good, indeed good! They expressed their determination to study, deeply understand, actively propagate, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's brilliant directive. They must cherish, support, and help the newly born revolutionary committees, making them more solid and perfect in the class struggle.

The revolutionary committees of Tianjin, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Gansu, and other provinces and municipalities held standing committee meetings or full committee meetings yesterday and today to earnestly study Chairman Mao's latest directive and the editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good." Many provincial and municipal revolutionary committees also issued notices and decisions to study and implement them earnestly. Many counties and districts in Hebei Province held telephone conferences overnight to propagate and implement Chairman Mao's latest directive. This morning, the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a celebration meeting. Provincial Revolutionary Committee leaders Li Xuefeng, Liu Zihou, and Geng Changsuo, and committee member Wang Guozhan, among others, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously pointed out that Chairman Mao's latest directive has illuminated the path for revolutionary committees, which is of great significance in promoting the thorough revolutionization of all levels of revolutionary committees and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must study it earnestly and implement it resolutely. The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Jinan Military Region today jointly held a radio broadcast oath-taking rally to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest directive on revolutionary committees. Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Chairman Cheng Shiqing and Vice Chairman Yang Dongliang, and committee members, today went to factories, institutions, schools, and military units to convey Chairman Mao's latest directive and propagate the editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good."

In studying the editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good," revolutionary masses and cadres in various places linked it with the good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in their regions and units, enthusiastically extolling the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee Chairman Xian Henghan said: Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's great directive, eleven prefectures, regions, and municipalities in Gansu Province have already established or approved the establishment of revolutionary committees. In the current good situation, Chairman Mao has issued another great latest directive, which will greatly promote the further implementation of the three-in-one combination and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. More than 70% of large and medium-sized factories, enterprises, and more than half of large and medium-sized schools in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and ten rural people's communes in the suburbs have established "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committees. Many members of revolutionary committees said in discussions today that in more than a year of intense class struggle, the newly born revolutionary committees have repeatedly smashed the fierce attacks of class enemies, fully demonstrating their strong vitality.

Comrades of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee pointed out that the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committees fully embody Chairman Mao's great teaching of "believing in and relying on the masses, believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army, and believing in and relying on the majority of cadres," closely combining the three aspects organizationally, better adapting to the needs of the socialist economic base, and better adapting to the needs of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. The power organ established according to Chairman Mao's great teaching has a broad mass base, has the great People's Liberation Army as a pillar, and has revolutionary leading cadres as the backbone. It has strong vitality. Comrades of the Qinghai "August 18th" Joint Committee excitedly said that now, except for one county, all prefectures, counties, and municipalities in Qinghai Province have established revolutionary committees, and the revolutionary situation is getting better and better. Today, after studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, our eyes are clearer and our hearts are brighter. Revolutionary committees are good because they are leadership cadres composed of representatives of revolutionary cadres, the military, and revolutionary masses, who can shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, better implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and correctly organize and lead the masses to advance. Comrades of the Hangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Committee excitedly said that our great leader Chairman Mao believes in the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, and respects the masses' revolutionary pioneering spirit the most. Chairman Mao instructs us that the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committees must have the participation of representatives of revolutionary masses, which ensures that our proletarian revolutionary power forever takes root among the masses. Revolutionary leading cadres participating in the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees said that the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committees must do as Chairman Mao teaches, so that the older generation does not detach from the masses and the younger generation gets tempered. In the revolutionary committees, we work with revolutionary masses and young revolutionaries, learning a lot from them and receiving great education. The direct participation of revolutionary masses in state management and the implementation of revolutionary supervision from the bottom up on various levels of power organs are of great significance in ensuring that our leading cadres at all levels prevent bureaucratism, adhere to the mass line, and maintain close ties with the masses. The participation of military representatives in the "three-in-one combination" power organ has strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat, developing military-civilian unity to a new stage. Such revolutionary committees can better withstand any storm and smash the plots of all class enemies at home and abroad, exerting greater power in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental aspect of the reform of state organs is to link with the masses." Revolutionary masses in various places, in studying the editorial, enthusiastically praised the new revolutionary style and beneficial institutions of the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committees. Workers of the third workshop of Changsha Automobile Electrical Equipment Factory, which established a revolutionary committee as early as last May, said that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee in our factory, everything important is discussed with us, and we are very satisfied. The members of the revolutionary committee often come down to the workshops, studying and working with us, humbly listening to the opinions of the masses. With such a "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committee that believes in and relies on the masses to lead us in seizing the revolution and promoting production, our enthusiasm is increasing. Revolutionary workers of Nanning's Beishan Brick and Tile Factory said that after the establishment of our factory's revolutionary committee, we truly implemented Chairman Mao's teaching of "streamlining personnel," changing the phenomenon of large, redundant, and redundant personnel in the factory. The factory used to have fifty-one full-time personnel, and production was still not good; now, full-time personnel have been reduced by more than half, and everything has someone to take care of, and production is continuously improving. Workers of Jiangxi Hongdu Machinery Factory and Harbin Bicycle Factory, in discussing the new situation and new appearance of the factory revolutionary committees, unanimously pointed out that the revolutionary committees implement the three-in-one combination, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, and integrate the three-eight style of the Liberation Army, the hard-working and struggling qualities of the working people, and our party's fine tradition of linking with the masses. In this way, it can truly become a revolutionary, closely linked with the masses, and authoritative proletarian power organ.

In studying Chairman Mao's latest directive and the editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good," the broad proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses in Shanghai, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Jilin, Sichuan, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Anhui, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Fujian, and Tibet Autonomous Regions, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions emphasized that revolutionary committees are good in thousands of ways, but the most fundamental aspect is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively. Some revolutionary masses participating in the "three-in-one combination" power organ in Shanghai said that Chairman Mao's latest directive has pointed the way for the construction of revolutionary committees.

We must strive harder to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, taking it as our highest requirement to be absolutely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to the great thought of Mao Zedong, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Former Yang County Revolutionary Committee Chairman Chen Yonggui expressed that every member of our revolutionary committee must be absolutely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to the great thought of Mao Zedong, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must take the study, implementation, propagation, and defense of Chairman Mao's directives as our most sacred duty, and put the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place in all our work. Revolutionary masses in regions and units that have not yet established revolutionary committees expressed their determination to promote the early birth of revolutionary committees under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directive.

In enthusiastically acclaiming and studying Chairman Mao's latest directive and the editorial, the broad revolutionary masses across the country resolutely expressed that they must always love, firmly support, wholeheartedly help, and bravely defend the newly born revolutionary committees. They must be vigilant and expose the plots of class enemies who attempt to undermine and overthrow the revolutionary committees from the right or the "ultra-left." They must resolutely build the revolutionary committees into battle command posts that hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, closely link with the masses, are full of revolutionary spirit, act decisively and forcefully, and forever preserve revolutionary youth.

New China News Agency, March 30th: "The basic experience of revolutionary committees has three aspects: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination in the revolution. Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline personnel, and organize a revolutionary, mass-linked leadership cadre." This brilliant latest directive of the great leader Chairman Mao has greatly encouraged the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces. With their profound proletarian feelings of absolute loyalty to the great commander Chairman Mao, they enthusiastically acclaim the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive and enthusiastically acclaim revolutionary committees are good. They excitedly said: Revolutionary committees are good! Revolutionary committees are indeed good! We will resolutely cherish, support, defend, and help them, making them truly become revolutionary command posts with proletarian authority, exerting greater power in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

From last night to today, various units have listened to the important editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good" published in the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily many times. Wherever Chairman Mao's latest directive reaches, there is rejoicing. The cadres and fighters thousands of times enthusiastically shout: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!" With boundless joy in their hearts, they organized discussions, put up wall newspapers, posted big-character posters, held celebration meetings, and enthusiastically talked about the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest directive and the great significance of the birth of revolutionary committees like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. It is an important sign of the good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a magnificent scene of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some units held party committee meetings or expanded party committee meetings, making decisions to urge their subordinate units to resolutely and swiftly implement Chairman Mao's latest directive; some units held overnight "support and defend revolutionary committees oath-taking rallies," expressing their absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao, absolute loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with red hearts. Some units rushed to print Chairman Mao's latest directive and rushed to rehearse programs such as "Revolutionary Committees Are Good," going deep into factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools to propagate to the proletarian revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses. Some cadres and fighters also held thematic praise meetings with revolutionary masses, enthusiastically praising the mighty power of the revolutionary committees that have appeared on the eastern horizon.

In studying, the broad cadres and fighters enthusiastically praised the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest directive and the mighty vitality of revolutionary committees. Representatives attending the conference of active learners and propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought among the National Defense Science and Technology Commission and Wuhan, Jinan, Kunming, and other units said: Revolutionary committees are a great creation of the Chinese working class and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in the process of struggling against a handful of capitalist roaders within the party under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. They will lead the proletariat and broad revolutionary masses to play a great revolutionary role in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In a discussion, Cluster Commander Song Kongguang of a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region excitedly said that the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committees are a new proletarian revolutionary power organ proposed by Chairman Mao after geniusly summarizing the masses' experience in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They can better adapt to the needs of the socialist economic base and better adapt to the needs of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. A military representative participating in the Qingdao Vehicle Factory Revolutionary Committee, in talking about his personal experience, said that Chairman Mao's latest directive has pointed the way for the construction of revolutionary committees. He said that the Vehicle Factory Revolutionary Committee has twenty-four members, only three of whom are full-time, and only one person is left in the office on duty every day. The other members all work and study with the workers. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teaching, better implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline personnel, and strive to build the revolutionary committees into revolutionary, mass-linked leadership cadres.

"When the military and civilians unite as one, who in the world can be our enemy?" Broad cadres and fighters of various headquarters, military branches, and military services unanimously believe in studying that following Chairman Mao's teaching and implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" will further develop military-civilian unity to a new stage and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. Broad cadres and fighters of Beijing, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan, and other units fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" used a large number of vivid examples to illustrate that military personnel participating in revolutionary committees and "three supports and two militaries" work have closely linked with the masses, received great tempering, and the military and civilians are more intimate, and the dictatorship of the proletariat is more consolidated. This will certainly exert greater power in smashing the plots of all class enemies at home and abroad and in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The supporting left work model unit—Unit 8341 of the supporting left forces in Beijing Textile General Factory—said in a discussion that implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," revolutionary cadre representatives, military representatives, and revolutionary mass representatives work and fight together, implement unified leadership, learn from each other, help each other, make up for each other's shortcomings, and make the revolutionary committees become absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's strong battle command posts, displaying vigorous vitality in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the enthusiastic atmosphere of acclaiming Chairman Mao's latest directive, the broad cadres and fighters resolutely expressed that they will resolutely cherish, support, respect, and defend the revolutionary committees. Whoever supports the revolutionary committees is our friend, and whoever opposes the revolutionary committees is our enemy. With a red heart, we love the revolutionary committees and vow to be good defenders of the revolutionary committees. "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People," "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," "Model Red Ninth Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works," "Iron Second Company," "Sea Tiger Boat," "Aviation Hero Squadron," and "Iron-Road Warrior" Zhang Chunyu, Mao Zedong's good fighter Nian Sihuang, and others, in discussing and studying, all talked about definitely following Li Wentong's example, "Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; Chairman Mao instructs me, I act accordingly; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance." Chairman Mao issues the latest directive, and we will definitely act accordingly. Chairman Mao says "revolutionary committees are good," and we will definitely love, support, and defend them with our lives. Broad cadres and fighters of Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other units guarding the coastal front lines, and broad cadres and fighters of Yunnan, Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, and other units guarding the border outposts, all expressed that they will increase vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen preparedness, resolutely crack down on all plots of domestic and foreign class enemies, and use their lives and blood to defend the proletarian revolutionary power organ—the revolutionary committees, letting them forever advance along the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao.

    全国亿万军民最热烈欢呼革命委员会好！
    毛主席关于革命三结合的光辉指示
    为革命委员会建设指出了根本方向
    正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的广大军民，决心认真学习、热情宣传、迅速落实、坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席的、革命化的、联系群众的战斗指挥部，时刻警惕和揭露阶级敌人从右的或极“左”的方面来动摇、颠覆革命委员会的阴谋
    新华社三十日讯　《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的重要社论《革命委员会好》，传达了我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”这一特大喜讯传到全国各地，举国上下一片欢腾。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众最热烈地欢呼毛主席这一光辉的最新指示，为革命委员会的建设指出了根本的方向，给正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的亿万革命群众增加了新的无比巨大的战斗力量。他们最热烈地欢呼：“革命委员会好！”最热烈地欢呼：“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    各地广大革命群众无比兴奋地说，一年前，当东方地平线上刚刚出现革命委员会这个新生事物的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席，就以他无产阶级革命家的伟大天才，高瞻远瞩地指出：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”一年来，在毛主席伟大指示的指引下，我国无产阶级文化大革命取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。在祖国大地上，革命委员会的鲜艳红旗联翩出现，迎风招展。在这一空前大好形势下，毛主席向我们发出了新的战斗号令，这是对我们的最大鼓舞，最大教育，最大支持，最大鞭策。我们一定要认真学习，热情宣传，迅速落实，坚决执行，把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席的革命化的联系群众的战斗指挥部，在毛主席的一系列最新指示的指引下，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    在首都，社论《革命委员会好》刚一广播，广大革命群众就奔走相告，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。北京市革命委员会的一些委员、农代会的常委，立即到群众中去，到贫下中农中去，热情宣传伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示和社论精神。正在出席北京中等学校红卫兵活学活用毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的许多代表，今天在学习座谈会上，结合自己学校成立革命委员会以后的大好形势，大颂毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，大摆革命委员会的好处。北京铁路局广安门地区所属六个单位的革命职工和支左解放军，举行了最热烈欢呼和庆祝毛主席最新指示发表大会。会后，革命委员会部分干部以及一些革命群众和支左解放军，进行了座谈，他们说，毛主席的最新光辉指示，句句说到了我们心坎里，革命委员会就是好，就是好！他们表示，一定要认真学习、深刻领会、积极宣传、坚决贯彻毛主席的这一光辉指示，一定要爱护、支持、帮助新诞生的革命委员会，使它在阶级斗争中更加巩固、完善。
    天津、山东、黑龙江、贵州、江西、河南、河北、湖北、广东、浙江、甘肃等省、市的革命委员会，昨晚和今天纷纷举行常委会议或全体委员会议，认真地学习毛主席的最新指示和社论《革命委员会好》。许多省、市的革命委员会，还发出了认真学习和贯彻执行的通知和决定。河北省许多地、县的革命委员会，连夜召开电话会议，宣传贯彻毛主席的最新指示。今天上午，河北省革命委员会举行了庆祝会。省革命委员会负责人李雪峰、刘子厚、耿长锁和常委王国藩等同志，在会上讲了话。他们一致指出，毛主席的最新指示，照亮了革命委员会前进的道路，对于促进各级革命委员会的彻底革命化，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，具有极其重要的意义。我们一定要认真学习，坚决贯彻执行。山东省革命委员会和济南部队今天联合召开了坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示的广播誓师大会。江西省革命委员会主任程世清同志、副主任杨栋梁同志和常委们，今天分别到工厂、机关、学校、部队传达伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，宣讲社论《革命委员会好》。
    各地广大革命群众和革命干部在学习社论《革命委员会好》的时候，联系本地区、本单位无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，热烈颂扬毛主席最新指示的伟大意义。甘肃省革委会主任冼恒汉同志说：在伟大领袖毛主席伟大指示的指引下，甘肃省十一个专、州、市，有九个已经成立或已经批准成立革委会。在当前一派大好形势下，毛主席又发出了伟大的最新指示，这对进一步促进革命的三结合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，必将起巨大的推动作用。河南省郑州市目前已有百分之七十以上的大中型厂矿企业、一半以上的大中学校和郊区的十个农村人民公社，建立了“三结合”的革命委员会。许多革命委员会的成员，今天在座谈时兴奋地说，在一年多激烈的阶级斗争中，新诞生的革命委员会不断粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，充分显示了它的强大的生命力。
    天津市革命委员会常委会的同志们指出，“三结合”的革命委员会，最充分地体现了毛主席“要相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数”的伟大教导，把三个方面在组织上紧密地结合在一起，更加适应社会主义经济基础的需要，更加适应巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的需要。按照毛主席的伟大教导建设起来的“三结合”的权力机构，具有广泛的群众基础，有伟大的人民解放军作支柱，有革命领导干部作骨干，它有强大的生命力。青海省“八·一八”联委会的同志们兴奋地说，现在，青海省除了一个县以外，其余的州、县、市都成立了革命委员会，革命形势越来越好。今天，学习了毛主席的最新指示，我们的眼更明，心更亮。革命委员会之所以好，就是因为它是有革命干部的代表、军队的代表和革命群众的代表参加的“三结合”的领导班子，能把革命、生产两副重担一肩挑，能更好地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，正确地组织和带领群众前进。杭州市革命职工委员会的同志们激动地说，我们伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众，最尊重群众的革命首创精神。毛主席指示我们，
  “三结合”的革命委员会，要有革命群众的代表参加，这就保证我们无产阶级革命政权永远扎根于群众。参加广东省和广州市革命委员会的革命领导干部说，“三结合”的革命委员会，一定要做到毛主席所教导的那样，使前辈人不脱离群众，使青年人得到锻炼。在革命委员会中，我们同革命群众、革命小将一起工作，从他们身上学到很多东西，受到很大教育。有革命群众直接参加国家的管理，对各级政权机构实行自下而上的革命监督，这对于保证我们各级领导班子防止官僚主义，坚持群众路线，和群众保持血肉的联系，有十分重大的意义。军队代表参加“三结合”的权力机构，强化了无产阶级专政，把我们的军民团结发展到一个崭新的阶段。这样的革命委员会，就更能够经受任何惊涛骇浪的考验，就更能够粉碎国内外一切阶级敌人的阴谋，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中发挥出更加强大的威力。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”各地革命群众在学习社论时，热烈赞扬“三结合”的革命委员会有崭新的革命作风和有利于人民的制度。早在去年五月就成立了革命委员会的长沙汽车电器厂三车间的工人说，我们厂革命委员会成立后，有什么大事都交给我们讨论，我们最满意。革委会的成员经常下车间来，和我们一起学习、一起劳动，虚心听取群众的意见。有这样一个相信群众、依靠群众的“三结合”的革命委员会领导我们抓革命、促生产，我们的干劲就越来越大。南宁市北岸砖瓦厂的革命职工说，我们厂革委会成立后，真正实现了毛主席“精兵简政”的教导，改变了工厂中机构庞大、重叠、人浮于事的现象。全厂过去有五十一个脱产人员，生产还搞不好；现在脱产人员减少了一半多，事事有人抓，生产不断上升。江西洪都机械厂和哈尔滨自行车厂的职工，在畅谈工厂革命委员会成立后出现的新气象、新面貌时一致指出，革命委员会实行三结合，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，把解放军的三八作风，劳动人民艰苦奋斗的品质和我党联系群众的优良传统融合在一起了。这样就能真正成为革命化的、密切联系群众的、具有革命权威的无产阶级的权力机构。
    上海、山西、内蒙古、江苏、吉林、四川、宁夏、陕西、辽宁、安徽、新疆、云南、福建、西藏等省、市、自治区广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在学习毛主席的最新指示和社论《革命委员会好》时强调指出，革命委员会千好万好，最根本的一条，是要活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想。上海市一些参加“三结合”权力机构的革命群众代表说，毛主席的最新指示，给革命委员会的建设指出了根本的方向。
    我们一定要更加努力活学活用毛泽东思想，把无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，作为对自己的最高要求。山西省昔阳县革命委员会主任陈永贵同志表示，我们革命委员会的每一个成员，都要无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。要把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的指示，当作自己最神圣的职责，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位。还没有建立革委会的地区和单位的革命群众表示，一定要在毛主席最新指示的指引下，促进革命委员会早日诞生。
    全国各地广大革命群众在热烈欢呼、认真学习毛主席的最新指示和社论时坚决表示，对新生的革命委员会，要始终不渝地热爱她，坚定不移地支持她，满腔热情地帮助她，坚决勇敢地捍卫她。要警惕和揭露阶级敌人从右的或极“左”的方面来动摇、颠覆革命委员会的阴谋。坚决把革命委员会建设成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，密切联系群众，充满革命干劲，雷厉风行，精悍有力的无产阶级战斗指挥部，使革命委员会永葆革命青春。
    新华社三十日讯　“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”伟大领袖毛主席的这一光辉的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员。他们怀着无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表，热烈欢呼革命委员会好。他们激动地说：革命委员会好！革命委员会就是好！我们坚决爱护它，支持它，保卫它，帮助它，让它真正成为有无产阶级权威，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业中发挥更强大威力的革命司令部。
    从昨晚到今天，各部队一次又一次地收听了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的重要社论《革命委员会好》。毛主席最新指示传到那里，那里一片欢腾。指战员们千百遍地高呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”他们怀着无比喜悦的心情，纷纷组织座谈讨论，出墙报，贴大字标语，开庆祝大会，大讲毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，大讲革命委员会如雨后春笋般地诞生，是无产阶级文化大革命形势大好、越来越好的一个重要标志，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的壮丽一幕。有的部队召开党委会或党委扩大会，作出决定，号召所属部队最坚决、最迅速地落实毛主席的这一最新指示；有的部队连夜召开“支持和保卫革命委员会誓师大会”，表达无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的赤胆忠心。还有些部队赶印毛主席最新指示，赶排《革命委员会好》等文艺节目，深入工厂、农村、机关、学校，向无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众进行宣传。有的指战员还和革命群众一起举行专题颂扬会，大颂特颂出现在东方地平线上的革命委员会的无比强大的威力。
    广大指战员在学习中，热烈颂扬毛主席最新指示的伟大意义和革命委员会的无比生命力。正在出席国防科委和武汉、济南、昆明等部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的代表，一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的最新指示，他们说：革命委员会是我国工人阶级和亿万革命群众在毛泽东思想指引下，向党内一小撮走资派进行夺权斗争过程中的一个伟大创举，它将带领无产阶级和广大革命群众，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，发挥出巨大的革命作用。南京部队某部团长宋孔广，在座谈中激动地说，“三结合”的革命委员会，是毛主席在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，天才地总结了群众的经验以后，提出的崭新的无产阶级的革命权力机构，它更能适应社会主义经济基础的需要，更能适应巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的需要。参加青岛车辆厂革命委员会的部队代表，在谈到自己的切身体会时说，毛主席的最新指示为革命委员会的建设指出了根本的方向。他说，车辆厂革命委员会有二十四个委员，只有三个脱产的，每天只留一个人在办公室值班，其他委员都同工人一起劳动，一起学习。我们一定遵照毛主席的教导，更好地实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，为把革命委员会建设成为一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子而努力。
    “军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”各总部、各军种、各兵种广大指战员在学习中一致认为：遵照毛主席的教导，实行革命的“三结合”，就会进一步地把军民团结发展到一个崭新的阶段，强化无产阶级专政。战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的北京、沈阳、广州、南京、兰州、成都、武汉等部队的广大指战员，用大量的生动事例说明，部队人员参加革命委员会，参加“三支”“两军”工作，密切联了群众，受到了很大的锻炼，军民更加亲密无间，无产阶级专政更加巩固。这对粉碎国内外一切阶级敌人的阴谋，对社会主义革命和社会主义建设，必将发挥出更强大的威力。支左工作中的一面红旗——八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员在座谈中说，实行革命“三结合”，革命干部代表、部队代表和革命群众代表在一起工作，一起战斗，实行一元化领导，互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，使革命委员会成为无限忠于毛主席的坚强的战斗指挥部，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，显示出了朝气勃勃的强大生命力。
    在欢呼毛主席最新指示的热烈气氛中，广大指战员坚定地表示：坚决爱护、支持、尊重、保卫革命委员会。谁拥护革命委员会就和谁亲，谁反对革命委员会就和谁拚，一颗红心热爱革命委员会，誓做捍卫革命委员会的好战士，为人民立新功。“支左爱民模范排”、“南京路上好八连”、“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”、“钢铁红二连”、“海上猛虎艇”、“航空兵英雄中队”的指战员和“铁道兵硬骨头战士”张春玉、毛主席的好战士年四旺等，在座谈讨论中都谈到，一定要象李文忠同志那样，“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”毛主席发出最新指示，我们就坚决照办，毛主席说“革命委员会好”，我们就坚决热爱它，拥护它，誓死捍卫它。守卫在海防前线的广西、广东、福建、浙江、江苏部队和守卫在边防前哨的云南、西藏、新疆、内蒙古、黑龙江等部队的广大指战员，纷纷表示：要百倍提高警惕，加强战备，坚决打击一切国内外阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，用生命和鲜血保卫无产阶级革命权力机构——革命委员会，让它永远沿着毛主席指引的革命航向阔步前进。
