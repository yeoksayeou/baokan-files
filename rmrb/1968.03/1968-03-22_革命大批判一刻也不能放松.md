There are two completely different attitudes towards the great criticism of the revolution.

One attitude is to oppose the great criticism of the revolution to other tasks, to do it intermittently, and to treat it as dispensable. This approach not only prevents the great criticism from being sustained and deepened, but also makes it impossible for other tasks to be accomplished.

The other attitude is to regard the great criticism of the revolution as the main direction of the struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to combine it with other tasks, using the great criticism to promote the development of other work.

The great criticism of the revolution is the most fundamental content that runs through the entire Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Reviewing the history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is there any step or any victory that has not been achieved through the great criticism of the revolution?

It was the great criticism of the revolution that ignited the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, preparing public opinion for this unprecedented revolution.

It was the great criticism of the revolution that exposed the true face of the capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents, preparing the conditions for the proletariat's struggle for power.

It was the great criticism of the revolution that exposed the class enemy's plot to split the revolutionary ranks, uniting the revolutionary masses of two or more factions into a mighty revolutionary army united under Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

It was the great criticism of the revolution that smashed the capitalist roaders' reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a small number," freeing a large number of revolutionary cadres and promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

At present, to consolidate the newly established revolutionary committees, to smash the class enemy's plot to restore the old order, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is particularly necessary to combine the current situation and tasks, and to sustain the great criticism of the revolution.

Whether or not to grasp the great criticism of the revolution is a major issue of whether or not one has a class struggle consciousness, whether or not one emphasizes proletarian politics, and whether or not one can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The great criticism of the revolution is a major offensive and counterattack by the proletariat against the plot of a small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party to restore capitalism. It is a continuation of the long-term class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will make their last desperate struggle." Every battle task in the process of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will encounter numerous obstacles set up by the class enemy in politics, ideology, theory, and organization. To remove these obstacles, one must never relax the great criticism of the revolution, this most sharp weapon of struggle.

    革命大批判一刻也不能放松本报评论员
    对待革命大批判有两种截然不同的态度。
    一种态度是：把革命的大批判同其他各项任务对立起来，搞搞停停，可有可无。这样做，不但大批判不能持续深入，其他各项任务也不可能搞好。
    另一种态度是：把革命的大批判当作无产阶级文化大革命的斗争大方向，并把它同其他各项任务结合起来，通过革命大批判推动其他各项工作的开展。
    革命的大批判，是贯穿无产阶级文化大革命始终的最基本的内容。回顾无产阶级文化大革命的历史，哪一步进程，哪一个胜利，离得了革命的大批判？
    是革命的大批判，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，为这场史无前例的大革命作了舆论准备。
    是革命的大批判，戳穿了资产阶级反动路线的画皮，暴露了党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人的原形，为无产阶级的夺权斗争准备了条件。
    是革命的大批判，揭露了阶级敌人分裂革命队伍的阴谋，把两派或几派的革命群众联合起来，组成一支统一于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的浩浩荡荡的革命大军。
    是革命的大批判，粉碎了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，把大批革命干部解放出来，促进了革命的三结合。
    当前，要巩固新生的革命委员会，粉碎阶级敌人的复辟阴谋，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，特别需要结合形势和任务，把革命的大批判持久地开展下去。
    抓不抓革命的大批判，是有没有阶级斗争观念，是不是突出无产阶级政治，能不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署、全面落实毛主席最新指示的重大问题。
    革命的大批判，是无产阶级对于党内一小撮走资派复辟阴谋的大进攻、大反击，是长期以来无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争的继续。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”无产阶级文化大革命进程中的每一项战斗任务，都会遇到阶级敌人在政治上、思想上、理论上和组织上设置的重重障碍。要扫除这些障碍，就一刻也不能放松革命大批判这个最锐利的战斗武器。
