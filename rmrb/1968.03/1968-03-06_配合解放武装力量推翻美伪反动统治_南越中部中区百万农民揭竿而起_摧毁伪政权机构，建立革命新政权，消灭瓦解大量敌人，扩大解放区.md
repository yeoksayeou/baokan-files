	Coordinating with Liberation Forces to Overthrow U.S. Puppet Regime

	Over a million farmers in the central region of South Vietnam rise up

	Destroying puppet government institutions, establishing revolutionary new governments, annihilating and disintegrating large numbers of enemy forces, and expanding liberated areas

	Hanoi, March 5 (Xinhua) - According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, over a million farmers in the central region of South Vietnam have risen up in the global-shaking Tet Offensive, coordinating with the People's Liberation Armed Forces to launch fierce attacks on the U.S. puppet regime, destroying many of the enemy's ruling institutions, annihilating and disintegrating large numbers of enemy forces, and expanding liberated areas.

	The report states that from January 30 to February 8, as the gunfire of the People's Liberation Armed Forces echoed throughout the entire central region, over a million farmers in this region took up arms. They destroyed many puppet government institutions, punished hundreds of bloodthirsty criminals, and, in coordination with the people in the occupied areas, cut off the first, fourteenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-first strategic highways, controlling many enemy strongholds on major transportation routes, and blowing up more than fifty bridges. Nearly 250,000 people in Quang Nam Province, 100,000 people in Quang Ngai Province, nearly 200,000 people in Quang Tri, Quang Nam, and other provinces, and tens of thousands of people in the Western Highlands took up arms, seizing enemy weapons, annihilating large numbers of "self-defense corps," leveling a series of enemy military strongholds and outposts, and destroying many "strategic hamlets."

	Under the heavy blows of the local military and people, the puppet government institutions in the entire region have largely disintegrated. Over 30,000 puppet soldiers and officers have deserted the enemy ranks, carrying weapons to join the people, volunteering to participate in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

	In these ten days, the liberated areas in the central region have rapidly expanded. The people of some counties in Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, and other provinces, after a short period of fighting, have completely cleared out the puppet army and puppet government institutions, expanded the liberated areas, and controlled large numbers of villages. The liberated areas around cities such as Da Nang, Hoi An, Tam Ky, Tuy Hoa, Qui Nhon, and Ban Me Thuot have also continued to expand.

	Currently, the farmers in the newly liberated areas are actively consolidating and developing political and military forces, quickly establishing and consolidating revolutionary governments, preparing at any time to crush the enemy's counterattacks, and vigorously promoting production and combat, thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors.

    配合解放武装力量推翻美伪反动统治
    南越中部中区百万农民揭竿而起
    摧毁伪政权机构，建立革命新政权，消灭瓦解大量敌人，扩大解放区
    新华社河内五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方中部中区一百多万农民，在震撼全球的新春攻势中，纷纷揭竿而起，配合人民解放武装力量，向美伪集团发动猛烈进攻，摧毁敌人许多统治机构，消灭和瓦解大量敌人，扩大了解放区。
    报道说，从一月三十日起到二月八日，在人民解放武装力量进攻的枪炮声响遍整个中部中区的时候，这个地区有一百多万农民奋起斗争。他们摧毁了许多伪政权机构，惩办了数百名血债累累的恶棍，并且配合敌占区人民切断了第一号、十四号、十八号、十九号和二十一号战略公路，控制了各条重要交通干线上的许多敌人据点，炸毁桥梁五十多座。近二十五万广南省人民、十万广义省人民、近二十万富安、庆和等省人民和数以万计的西原区人民奋起夺取敌人武器武装自己，消灭大批伪“民卫队”，夷平一系列敌军据点、哨所，捣毁许多“战略村”。
    在当地军民的沉重打击下，全区的伪政权机构大片瓦解。三万多伪军官兵脱离敌人队伍，携带武器投向人民，志愿参加抗美救国斗争。
    在这十天中，中部中区解放区迅速扩大。广义、平定等省的一些县的人民，经过短时间战斗，就完全扫清了伪军和伪政权机构，扩大了解放区，控制了大批乡村。岘港、会安、三岐、绥和、芽庄、邦美蜀等市周围的解放区也日益扩大。
    目前，新解放区农民正积极巩固和发展政治力量和武装力量，迅速建立和巩固革命政权，随时准备粉碎敌人的反扑，并且大力促进生产和战斗，彻底战胜美国侵略强盗。
