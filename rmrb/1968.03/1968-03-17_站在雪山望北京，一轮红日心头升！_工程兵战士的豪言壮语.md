Standing on the snowy mountains, gazing at Beijing, a red sun rises in our hearts!

	•	Standing on the snowy mountains, gazing at Beijing, a red sun rises in our hearts; through hard work and struggle we make revolution, forever following Chairman Mao.
	•	Tents adorned with Chairman Mao's portrait, making the whole country our home to build national defense; construction sites adorned with Chairman Mao's portrait, moving mountains and filling seas with strength; fortifications adorned with Chairman Mao's portrait, turning the vast land into an iron wall; everyone wearing Chairman Mao's portrait, every red heart facing the sun.
	•	With the "loyalty" to Chairman Mao in our minds, there is no "hardship" in our thoughts, no "difficulty" in our actions, and no "fear" in the face of danger.
	•	Hardship is glory, hardship is victory, hard work and struggle is loyalty to Chairman Mao.
	•	Engineering soldiers climb the mountains, ten thousand rivers and mountains applaud; iron picks flash with silver light, splitting the ten-thousand-foot cliffs, a thunderous roar, half the mountain tumbles down!
	•	Drops of sweat trickle down, inch by inch the red walls rise; every red heart is for the people, building after building of barracks facing the sun.

　　站在雪山望北京，一轮红日心头升！
　　——工程兵战士的豪言壮语
    △站在雪山望北京，一轮红日心头升；艰苦奋斗干革命，永远跟着毛泽东。
    △帐篷挂上毛主席像，四海为家建国防；工地挂上毛主席像，移山填海有力量；工事挂上毛主席像，万里江山变铜墙；人人佩戴毛主席像，颗颗红心向太阳。
    △头脑里有了对毛主席的“忠”字，思想上就没有“苦”字，行动上就没有“难”字，在艰险面前就没有“怕”字。
    △艰苦就是光荣，艰苦就是胜利，艰苦奋斗就是忠于毛主席。
    △工兵战士上山来，万水千山齐喝采；铁镐闪银光，劈开万丈崖，一阵惊雷响，半个山头滚下来！
    △一滴滴汗水往下淌，一寸寸红墙往上长；一颗颗红心为人民，一幢幢营房向太阳。
