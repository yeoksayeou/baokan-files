Recently, the U.S. destroyer "Iron Hammer," which was involved in the aggression against Vietnam, just as it entered the Australian port of Cairns, was met with strong protests from local residents. Some people in motorboats demonstrated around the U.S. warship, with banners hanging from the boats condemning U.S. aggression against Vietnam and demanding that U.S. aggressor troops withdraw from South Vietnam. About five hundred people held up banners condemning U.S. imperialism's aggression and barbaric massacre of the Vietnamese people, and held a demonstration in the city. As a result, the Australian authorities were forced to cancel the originally scheduled "welcome ceremony" for the U.S. warship involved in the aggression against Vietnam.

    澳人民愤怒抗议美军舰到澳活动
    最近，美国侵越驱逐舰“铁锤号”刚一开进澳大利亚开姆布拉港，就遭到当地人民强烈抗议。一部分人开着汽艇在这艘美国军舰周围示威，汽艇上挂着谴责美国侵略越南和要求美国侵略军滚出南越的横幅。大约五百名群众高举着谴责美帝国主义侵略和野蛮屠杀越南人民的横幅，在市内举行示威，结果迫使澳大利亚当局取消了原定为美国侵越军舰举行的“欢迎会”。
