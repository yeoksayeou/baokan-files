Title: The Brave Have High Skills

The Chinese Khrushchev's agent in the military, Luo Ruiqing, vigorously spread the reactionary fallacies of "we mainly rely on technology to complete tasks" and "the skilled are brave," madly opposing the emphasis on politics and the Four Firsts, attempting to change the color of our army and realize his ambition to usurp the Party and the military.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The foundation of the army lies with the soldiers. Without the spirit of progress permeating the army, without progressive political work to carry out this permeation, ... all technology and tactics cannot find the best foundation to exert their due effectiveness." Through executing tasks, I deeply felt that being skilled does not necessarily mean being brave; only the brave can be skilled. This bravery is the revolutionary soldier's red-hearted loyalty to Chairman Mao. Our troops' soldiers and commanders are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, they can train hard and make the best use of technical equipment to excellently complete tasks.

At the beginning of last year, we went to a desolate wilderness to execute a task. It was dozens of kilometers away from our base, and many places were difficult for vehicles to pass through, making it easy to get lost. Although we had not rested for three days and three nights, we decided to "carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous combat (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." In the cold of minus twenty degrees, our hands and feet became numb; wearing protective gear for a long time caused dizziness and headaches, making it difficult to operate the instruments. However, when we saw the smiling Chairman Mao waving at us, we suddenly became skilled and obtained one set of data after another. After an 11-12 hour arduous struggle, we finally overcame the difficulties of cold and thirst and successfully completed the task.

Luo Ruiqing's "the skilled are brave" is a variant of the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "technology determines everything." We must firmly grasp the emphasis on politics and firmly grasp the revolutionization of people's ideology, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, marching forward, ever forward.

　　胆大人艺高
　　某部参谋　刘春秋
    中国赫鲁晓夫在军内的代理人罗瑞卿竭力散布“我们主要是靠技术完成任务”，“艺高人胆大”等反动谬论，疯狂反对突出政治，反对四个第一，企图改变我军的颜色，实现其篡党篡军的野心。
    毛主席教导我们：“军队的基础在士兵，没有进步的政治精神贯注于军队之中，没有进步的政治工作去执行这种贯注，……一切技术和战术就不能得着最好的基础去发挥它们应有的效力。”通过执行任务，我深刻体会到艺高不见得胆大，只有胆大才能艺高。这个胆就是革命战士对毛主席的赤胆忠心。我们部队指战员无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，因此，能苦练过硬功夫，最大限度地发挥技术装备的效力，出色地完成任务。
    去年初，我们到一个荒无人烟的野地去执行任务。那里距驻地几十公里，很多地方汽车难以通行，容易迷失方向。我们虽然已经三天三夜没有休息，但下决心“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”在零下二十几度的严寒中，手脚麻木了；长时间穿戴防护器材，引起头晕脑胀，操纵仪器十分困难。但是，当我们看见微笑着向我们招手的毛主席像时，顿时心灵手巧，测得一个又一个数据。经过十一、二小时的艰苦奋战，我们终于克服了寒冷和饥渴的困难，胜利完成了任务。
    罗瑞卿的“艺高人胆大”是中国赫鲁晓夫技术“决定一切”谬论的变种。我们必须狠抓突出政治，狠抓人的思想革命化，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，前进，再前进。
