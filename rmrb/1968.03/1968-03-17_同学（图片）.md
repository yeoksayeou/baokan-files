	The soldiers of the 3225th Unit of the People's Liberation Army were all born and raised in the same village. They have been through thick and thin together, sharing joys and sorrows, and have forged a deep bond of camaraderie. They have fought side by side in the revolutionary struggles, from the early days of the Chinese Communist Party to the present, and have always been united in their efforts to serve the people and the revolution.

	In the early days of the revolution, they were all poor peasants who had suffered under the oppression of the landlords and the Kuomintang. They joined the Communist Party and took up arms to fight for a better future. They fought in the Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, and have always been at the forefront of the struggle.

	Now, as they stand together in the ranks of the People's Liberation Army, they are more determined than ever to defend the gains of the revolution and to build a socialist China. They are proud to be soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and are committed to serving the people and the revolution with all their hearts.

	They often reminisce about their past, recalling the hardships they endured and the victories they achieved. They remember the comrades who have fallen in the struggle and vow to carry on their legacy. They are united in their determination to fight for the cause of socialism and to build a prosperous and strong China.

	The soldiers of the 3225th Unit are a shining example of the revolutionary spirit and the unity of the Chinese people. They are a testament to the power of the Communist Party and the strength of the People's Liberation Army. They are proud to be classmates, comrades, and brothers in arms, and are committed to serving the people and the revolution with all their hearts.
