The Albanian "People's Voice" Hails the Great Victory of Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line
The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is Advancing with Irresistible Momentum Towards Complete Victory

	According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 19th, the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial on the 14th, enthusiastically hailing the new brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	The article, titled "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China Advances Victoriously," states that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong is advancing with unprecedented momentum and is achieving comprehensive victories in the political, ideological, organizational, and economic spheres. In this revolutionary torrent, the hundreds of millions of Chinese people are further strengthening their powerful revolutionary unity around the Communist Party of China and are fully supporting and endorsing Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line and his Marxist-Leninist thought. Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and revolutionary intellectuals armed with Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought are smashing the revisionist line and bourgeois line of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road with China's Khrushchev at their head throughout the country.

	The article praises the excellent situation of revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-one combinations in various places in China. The article points out that revolutionary great alliances have become an irresistible torrent; the establishment of many provincial and municipal revolutionary committees clearly shows that the Chinese revisionists have been thoroughly overthrown. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing very smoothly in both breadth and depth. These new victories have been won through fierce class struggle and in the steadfast efforts to strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	The article says that in the great struggle for the complete victory of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, and in the irresistible advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the glorious Communist Party of China is purifying and strengthening its ranks. As Chairman Mao Zedong's latest instructions say: Party organizations should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat. The Communist Party of China is further strengthening its role as the vanguard organization that can lead the Chinese working class and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy and push the revolution and socialist cause to the end. The work of rectifying Party organizations and strengthening Party building most vividly shows that the Chinese Communists and revolutionary masses are determined to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the leadership of the Party, the Communists and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, hoisting high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's revolutionary thought, will advance with even greater strides to win new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and will thoroughly smash the various plots and tricks of the imperialists and revisionists and their agents in China.

	The article says that the excellent situation that has emerged in the victorious advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has caused the creative power of the brilliant Chinese people to burst forth with redoubled strength. Revolutionary masses of the proletariat, workers, technicians, and commune members, under the battle cry of "Grasp revolution, promote production," have achieved new great victories on all fronts of socialist construction.

	China's science and technology are advancing at astonishing speed to reach the world's highest peaks. The mastery of the hydrogen bomb and missiles by New China has strengthened its powerful national defense, thoroughly foiling the great conspiracy of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists to contain China and attempt to intimidate China with nuclear blackmail. New China has broken the nuclear monopoly of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

	The article says that the comprehensive and magnificent achievements of the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have made the enemies of revolution and socialism—imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Brezhnev-Kosygin renegade clique in the Soviet Union—even more uneasy. They fear the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the further strengthening of China's economic and national defense power because revolutionary China is the main obstacle to their plan to dominate the world. They are maddened by the fact that New China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people who are taking up arms to fight bravely against the American aggressors. This is the reason why the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, in collusion, are continuing to engage in frenzied, all-round anti-China hostile activities, cursing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and stubbornly strengthening and expanding the "encirclement of firepower" against the People's Republic of China. They fear the inspiring example of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and its enormous influence among the revolutionary peoples of the world, and are desperately trying to distort and obliterate the reality of China. One of the Soviet revisionist leaders, Suslov, and his henchmen used the platform of the recently concluded counter-revolutionary black meeting in Budapest to viciously attack China. But all their plots will, as in the past, be smashed by the Chinese people.

	The article concludes by saying that the Albanian people sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on their new brilliant victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and congratulate the victory of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line and his Marxist-Leninist thought. These victories are also our victories, victories of the eternal fighting friendship between our two brotherly peoples and comrades-in-arms, and between our two Marxist-Leninist parties led by the tried and tested leaders Enver Hoxha and Mao Zedong. Our people regard the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the People's Republic of China and the consolidation of the socialist camp, the defeat of the bourgeois, revisionist enemies headed by China's Khrushchev, and the smashing of the imperialist and revisionist anti-China conspiracies as great contributions to the revolutionary cause. The brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution inspire all fighters for freedom, independence, socialism, and communism.

    阿《人民之声报》欢呼毛主席的无产阶级革命路线伟大胜利
    中国文化大革命正以澎湃气势向前发展夺取全面胜利
    据新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十四日发表编辑部文章，热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命取得新的辉煌胜利。
    这篇题为《中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进》的文章说，由毛泽东同志发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，正以空前的澎湃的气势向前发展，并正在政治、思想、组织和经济领域里夺取全面的胜利。在这个革命洪流中，中国亿万群众，正在进一步加强在中国共产党周围的强大的革命团结，并完全拥护和支持毛泽东同志的无产阶级革命路线和他的马克思列宁主义思想。用毛泽东的马克思列宁主义思想武装起来的工人、农民、战士、学生和革命知识分子正在全国粉碎以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的修正主义和资产阶级路线。
    文章赞扬中国各地实现革命的大联合和革命三结合的大好形势。文章指出，革命的大联合已经变成汹涌澎湃和势不可挡的洪流；许多省、市革命委员会的成立清楚地证明，中国的修正主义者现在已经被打翻在地。无产阶级文化大革命正在十分顺利地向广度和深度发展。这些新的胜利是通过激烈的阶级斗争取得的，是在为加强和巩固无产阶级专政的坚定的努力中取得的。
    文章说，在为争取毛泽东的无产阶级革命路线彻底胜利的伟大战斗中，在无产阶级文化大革命势不可挡的胜利进军中，光荣的中国共产党正在纯洁和加强自己的队伍。正如毛泽东主席的最新指示中所说的：党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成。中国共产党正在进一步加强她作为能够领导中国工人阶级和革命群众对阶级敌人进行战斗以及把革命和社会主义事业推进到底的先锋队组织的作用。整顿党的组织和加强党的建设的工作再好不过地说明，中国共产党人和革命群众决心大力加强无产阶级专政。中国共产党人和无产阶级革命派，在党的领导下，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东革命思想的旗帜，为争取无产阶级文化大革命的新的胜利，将以更快的步伐向前进军，将彻底粉碎帝修这些外部敌人及其在中国的代理人的各种阴谋诡计。
    文章说，在无产阶级文化大革命胜利进军中出现的大好形势，使天才的中国人民的创造能力以成倍的力量迸发出来。无产阶级革命派、工人、技术人员和人民公社社员，在“抓革命，促生产”的战斗口号下，在社会主义建设的各条战线上都取得了新的伟大成就。
    中国的科学和技术正以惊人的速度在攀登世界水平的最高峰。人民中国掌握氢弹和导弹使其强大的国防力量得到加强，使美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者遏制中国、企图以核讹诈恐吓中国的大阴谋彻底完蛋。人民中国已经打破了美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者的核垄断。
    文章说，中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中的全面的宏伟的成就，使革命和社会主义的敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义更为不安。他们害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的经济和国防力量的进一步加强，因为革命的中国是他们实行称霸世界计划的主要障碍。他们为中华人民共和国是拿起武器同美国侵略者进行英勇斗争的越南人民的可靠后方而发狂。这就是美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者串通一气继续疯狂地进行全面的反华敌对活动、咒骂中国无产阶级文化大革命、顽固地加强和扩大反对中华人民共和国的“火力包围圈”的原因所在。他们害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命的令人鼓舞的榜样及其在世界革命人民中间的巨大影响，拚命地歪曲和抹煞中国的现实。苏修头目之一苏斯洛夫及其娄罗们利用刚刚结束的布达佩斯反革命黑会的讲台恶毒攻击中国。但是，他们的一切阴谋将同过去一样，被中国人民所粉碎。
    文章最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心祝贺中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中的新的辉煌胜利，祝贺毛泽东的无产阶级革命路线和他的马克思列宁主义思想的胜利。这些胜利也是我们的胜利，是我们两国兄弟人民和战友之间，以及以久经考验的领袖霍查和毛泽东为首的我们两个马克思列宁主义政党之间的永恒的战斗友谊的胜利。我国人民把中华人民共和国的无产阶级专政的加强和社会主义阵地的巩固，把击溃以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级、修正主义敌人和粉碎帝修反华大阴谋，看作是对革命事业的巨大贡献。中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中的辉煌成就，鼓舞着为自由、独立、社会主义和共产主义而奋斗的所有战士。
