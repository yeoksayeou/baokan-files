The spring breeze blows across the land, and the songs of victory echo far and wide. New revolutionary committees are being established across the country! In this unprecedentedly good situation, another piece of exhilarating news has arrived: the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees have been issued. In these latest instructions, Chairman Mao, with his great genius, has summarized the basic experiences of revolutionary committees at all levels and pointed out the fundamental direction for the construction of revolutionary committees. The people of Xingguo are all overjoyed and shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!

The revolutionary committee is good, the revolutionary committee is truly good. The members of the revolutionary committee, having all passed the test of class struggle, are outstanding representatives of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres. They all have deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, for Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They regard loyalty to Chairman Mao as the highest criterion for their words and deeds, and regard studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's instructions as their sacred duty. The members of the revolutionary committee focus on the fundamentals, organizing the people of the entire county to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, a new wave of mass learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought swept across the entire county, greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the people of the entire county and powerfully driving the people of the entire county to create "first-class work." After the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, class struggle was vigorously carried out, and continuous revolutionary criticism was launched, raising the class consciousness of the people of the entire county and further eliminating the poison of Khrushchev's revisionism in China. The poor and lower-middle peasants joyfully said: "In the old county committee, a handful of capitalist roaders advocated piecework and material incentives. Now, the revolutionary committee advocates political leadership and cares for us politically. The revolutionary power of the three-in-one combination is truly good!"

Among the members of the revolutionary committee, the representatives of the working and peasant masses who do not separate from production play an important role. They have infused new blood into our proletarian dictatorship and brought in new air. For example, Comrade Zhong Xiuxin, a member of the standing committee of the county revolutionary committee, is a representative of revolutionary workers. In addition to participating in the work of the county revolutionary committee, he often returns to the factory to work on the shop floor. Some workers advised him to move to the county revolutionary committee to live. He replied: "Moving to the county revolutionary committee to live makes it convenient to go to work, but the distance between me and you will become greater and greater." Because he has maintained the character of the working class, the broad masses of workers all support and endorse him. Comrade Wu Caifang, a member of the revolutionary committee living in the countryside, in addition to participating in the work of the county revolutionary committee, spends most of his time in the production team, studying, working, and criticizing revisionism together with the commune members. Through these comrades, the county revolutionary committee can maintain the closest ties with the broad masses of workers and peasants and can better and more timely convey the voice of Chairman Mao and the voice of the proletarian headquarters to the broad masses of workers and peasants. The representatives of the revolutionary masses working together with revolutionary cadres and representatives of the People's Liberation Army can also directly learn from them how to do political work and grasp class struggle, improve their policy level and work ability, and better serve the people.

"The unity of the army and the people is like one person; see who can defeat us?" The representatives of the People's Liberation Army directly participating in the revolutionary committee can not only bring the good traditions and good style of the army to the revolutionary committee but also have great significance for strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. After the establishment of our county revolutionary committee, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the ghosts and snakes in society deceived some masses and stirred up wave after wave of evil winds, attempting to exert pressure on the new-born revolutionary power to achieve their unspeakable evil purposes. However, "it is easy for an ant to shake a tree," with the strong support of the great People's Liberation Army, we have timely exposed and smashed the plots of the class enemies, and the new-born revolutionary power has become more and more consolidated.

The revolutionary cadres in the revolutionary committee, after more than a year of class struggle storms, have severely examined their souls and further established the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. They work together with the revolutionary masses, which can bring the old and the new together, making the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause grow rapidly; at the same time, they can directly hear the opinions of the masses and be supervised by the masses, preventing and overcoming bureaucratic tendencies.

We also follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "streamlining administration and reducing personnel" to break down the overlapping administrative organs of the old county committee and county people's committee, reducing the number of administrative personnel by two-thirds and strengthening the leadership at the grassroots level.

In the past few months, the new-born revolutionary power has shown great superiority. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory," to strive to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees, to continuously improve the work of the revolutionary committee, and to lead the people of the entire county to create new "first-class work" to respond to Chairman Mao's care for us.

    三结合的革命政权就是好
    江西省兴国县革命委员会
    春风吹大地，凯歌传四方，大批新生的革命委员会在全国各地陆续建立起来了！就在这空前大好形势下，又传来振奋人心的喜讯：伟大领袖毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示发表了。在这一最新指示中，毛主席以他伟大的天才，总结了各级革命委员会的基本经验，指出了革命委员会建设的根本方向。兴国儿女无不欢欣鼓舞，一千遍一万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    革命委员会好，革命委员会就是好。参加革委会的成员，由于都经过了阶级斗争的考验，是人民解放军、广大贫下中农、革命工人、革命学生和革命干部的优秀代表。他们都对伟大领袖毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的革命路线有着深厚的阶级感情。他们把忠于毛主席作为衡量自己言行的最高准则，把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的指示作为自己的神圣职责。革命委员会的成员狠抓根本，组织全县人民活学活用毛主席著作，大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。在县革委会成立后，全县迅速掀起了群众性的活学活用毛泽东思想的新的热潮，大大促进了全县人民的思想革命化，有力地推动着全县人民去创造“第一等的工作”。县革委会成立后，狠抓阶级斗争，持续地开展革命大批判，提高了全县人民的阶级觉悟，进一步肃清了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义流毒。贫下中农高兴地说：“旧县委内一小撮走资派搞的是工分挂帅，物质刺激，现在，革委会政治挂帅，从政治上关心我们。三结合的革命政权就是好！”
    县革委会的成员中，不脱离生产的工农群众代表起着重要的作用。他们为我们的无产阶级政权充实了新的血液，带来了新的空气。例如，县革委会常委钟修信同志，是革命工人代表。他除了参加县革委会的工作以外，经常回到厂里下车间劳动。有的工人劝他搬到县革委会去住。他回答说：“搬到县革委会去住，上班是近了，但我同你们的距离会越来越远。”由于他保持了工人阶级的本色，广大工人群众都拥护和支持他。住在农村的革委会委员吴才枋同志，除了参加县革委会的工作以外，绝大部分时间都在生产队里，同社员一起学习，一起劳动，一起斗私批修。县革委会通过这些同志，既和广大工农群众保持了最密切的联系，又能把毛主席的声音、无产阶级司令部的声音，更好地及时传达到广大工农群众中去。革命群众的代表同革命干部、人民解放军代表一起工作，也可以直接向他们学习做政治工作、抓阶级斗争的经验，提高政策水平和工作能力，更好地为人民服务。
      “军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”人民解放军代表直接参加革委会，不但可以把解放军的好传统、好作风带到革委会来，而且对于加强无产阶级专政有很大的意义。我们县革委会成立以后，党内一小撮走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，蒙蔽了一些群众，刮起了一股又一股的歪风，妄图对新生的革命政权施加压力，达到他们不可告人的罪恶目的。但是，“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”，在伟大的人民解放军的大力支持下，我们及时地揭穿和粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋，新生的革命政权越来越巩固了。
    县革委会中的革命领导干部，经过一年多来阶级斗争暴风雨的考验，狠触了自己的灵魂，进一步树立了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想。他们和革命群众一起工作，就可以以老带新，使无产阶级革命事业接班人迅速成长；同时，可以直接听到群众的意见，受到群众的监督，防止和克服官僚主义作风。
    我们还遵照毛主席“精兵简政”的教导，打破了旧县委、县人委的重叠的行政机构，精简了三分之二的机关工作人员，充实了基层领导力量。
    几个月来，新生的革命政权已经显示出巨大的优越性。我们决心遵照毛主席的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教导，努力贯彻执行毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示，不断改进革委会的工作，带领全县人民去创造新的“第一等的工作”，来回答毛主席他老人家对我们的关怀。
