The joyous news that our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, received the representatives of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the six military branches and two academies, has greatly inspired the cadres and soldiers of these units. The representatives of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works from these units and the cadres and soldiers of the military and civilian departments, with hearts full of boundless excitement and happiness, held grand meetings and parades to celebrate this joyous event. They resolved to take Vice Chairman Lin as their shining example, to be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao with a single "loyalty," to grasp the use of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought with a single "use," and to turn the six military branches and two academies into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

On the night of March 7, the headquarters of the artillery, armored, engineering, railway, communication, and chemical defense troops, the Higher Military Academy, the Political Academy, and the venues of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works from various units were brightly lit, with red flags waving and firecrackers and drums echoing through the sky. Bunches of fireworks illuminated the night sky of the capital in a riot of colors. The active learners of Chairman Mao's works, who had just been warmly received by Chairman Mao, together with the cadres and soldiers, workers, and family members of the military and civilian departments, held grand celebrations. They sang with tears of joy, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and enthusiastically sang "The East is Red," "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman," and "Father and Mother are Dear, but Not as Dear as Chairman Mao." They repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Chen Renqi, Huang Zhiyong, Chen Shiqian, Tan Furen, Luo Huasheng, Jiang Wen, Huang Wenming, Li Zhen, Liu Zhong, and Song Weiqin, the leaders of the six military branches and two academies, participated in the celebration meetings and spoke at the meetings. They said that the great commander Chairman Mao is in excellent health, which is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao's reception is the greatest care, trust, encouragement, and spur for our conference and all the cadres and soldiers of the army. We must forever remember this most happy moment, and we must turn Chairman Mao's warm reception into a great driving force, to launch a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought on a larger scale. They praised the great leader Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with the history of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and their personal revolutionary struggle practice. They required the representatives of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works and the broad cadres and soldiers of the subordinate units to take Vice Chairman Lin as their shining example, to firmly establish an unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They must regard being loyal to Chairman Mao as the most fundamental standpoint, the highest awareness, and the purest party nature. They must regard defending Chairman Mao's highest leadership position as their most sublime and sacred duty. They must regard Mao Zedong Thought as the highest criterion for all actions and the highest guiding principle for all work. For every instruction from the great leader Chairman Mao, they must implement it seriously and carry it out resolutely. They must firmly establish the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, combining learning and application, seeing immediate results, and working hard on the "use." They must strive to learn and apply Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles on continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, and follow the revolutionary course opened by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, breaking waves and forging ahead!

During the celebration, the representatives of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works and the broad cadres and soldiers of various units, with deep feelings of unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, solemnly swore: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Defending you is our greatest duty; defending your brilliant thoughts and revolutionary line is our lifelong mission; reading your red revolutionary book is our lifelong need; being your good soldier is our sublime aspiration. To defend you, to defend your brilliant thoughts, to defend your proletarian revolutionary line, we dare to climb the knife mountain and dare to rush into the fire sea. We will forever be loyal to you, our hearts unchanging even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, we will forever follow you, our will unshaken even if the sky falls and the earth collapses.

The "iron-hard soldiers" of the railway troops, Zhang Chunyu, Peng Zuxun of a certain artillery unit who was awarded the first-class merit, Shi Futing of the armored troops who was a model soldier in five aspects like Ouyang Hai, Zheng Dingfu of a certain engineering unit who was a volunteer war hero, Ding Xiuzhen of a certain chemical defense unit who was a practicing researcher, and the representative of a certain long-distance station of the communication troops, as well as the revolutionary soldiers of the six military branches and two academies, were extremely excited and expressed their determination to better respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call, to read Chairman Mao's books, to listen to Chairman Mao's words, to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be Chairman Mao's good soldiers, to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought higher, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "not eating old capital, but creating new merits," and to create new merits for the people in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At the celebration meeting, the representatives passed a resolution of determination to Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin with enthusiastic applause. Some military branches and academies' party committees also held late-night meetings and made the decision to "Celebrate the warm reception by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and to turn the troops into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought."

The joyous news of the great commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin warmly receiving the revolutionary soldiers was quickly transmitted by telephone and telegram to Shaoshan, Jinggangshan, Zunyi, Yan'an, the Kangba Plateau, the front lines of the southeast coast, and all over the country. Wherever the news spread, there was joy and excitement. The broad cadres and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, who are loyal to Chairman Mao, welcomed the sunrise, facing Beijing, and sang "The East is Red" with all their hearts, wishing the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!
