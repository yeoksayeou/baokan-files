	Educating oneself with Mao Zedong Thought
	The revolutionary youngsters of the junior high school graduating class at Guiyang Thirteenth Middle School, through the study of Mao Zedong Thought classes, unanimously believe that educating oneself is not about being unmanageable by anyone, nor is it about using anarchism to indulge oneself.

	Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, March 17 - How should we correctly understand the great teacher Chairman Mao's instruction of "educating oneself"? The revolutionary youngsters of the junior high school graduating class at Guiyang Thirteenth Middle School, through the study of Mao Zedong Thought classes, unanimously believe that educating oneself is about using Mao Zedong Thought to educate and arm oneself, and it is absolutely not about being unmanageable by anyone, nor is it about using anarchism to indulge oneself.

	Since March last year, when Guiyang Thirteenth Middle School resumed classes and made revolution, there has been a debate among the students of the junior high school graduating class on how to correctly understand Chairman Mao's instruction of "educating oneself." Recently, they held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, taking "criticizing private thoughts and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly criticizing the anarchist thoughts such as "now it is about educating oneself, no one can manage anyone," and unifying the understanding of "educating oneself." Now, all 185 graduating students in the three junior high school graduating classes of the entire school are firmly holding on to returning to school to make revolution. After completing the graduation assessment, all graduating students continue to return to school, obeying the unified arrangement of the school revolutionary committee. Some go to factories for labor practice, some are responsible for receiving new students, and some serve as tutors for lower-grade students. Together with all revolutionary teachers and students in the school, they have made the school's resumption of classes and revolution vigorously. The revolutionary youngsters have expressed their determination to follow the strategic deployment of the great teacher Chairman Mao, to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, making new contributions.

	Before holding the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, due to the influence of anarchist trends, the number of students attending classes in the graduating class was the least, and classroom discipline was the worst. Teachers and class cadres mobilized them to resume classes and make revolution, and they said that now it is about "educating oneself," and the school cannot manage them.

	However, a part of the active elements among the graduates, such as the eight revolutionary youngsters of the "Expel Tigers and Leopards" combat team in Class 2 of Grade 3, insisted on attending school every day and actively participating in the educational revolution. When other students in the class did not attend school, they went to their classmates' homes to visit, studying Chairman Mao's works with these classmates and mobilizing them to return to school to contribute to the educational revolution and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. When some teachers had opinions about the anarchist tendencies among the students and were unwilling to teach, the students of "Expel Tigers and Leopards" went to their homes to invite them.

	Once, they went to invite a teacher, and this teacher said angrily, "You educate yourselves!" On the spot, the students and the teacher studied Chairman Mao's instruction together: "You should care about national affairs and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!" And they said to this teacher, resuming classes and making revolution is the great call of Chairman Mao, if the teacher does not teach, and still asks the students to educate themselves, how are you listening to Chairman Mao's words? Some students proposed, hoping that this teacher would first use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize private thoughts and revisionism, and educate oneself first. The students' sharp and pertinent criticism made this teacher change his attitude and actively shoulder the responsibilities of a revolutionary teacher.

	Chairman Mao instructs: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The revolutionary committee of Guiyang Thirteenth Middle School, following Chairman Mao's instruction, specifically held a Mao Zedong Thought study class for the graduates, targeting the anarchist tendencies among the students. The graduates repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles" in the study class, using the arrows of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the targets of anarchist thoughts, letting the students recognize in the process of study, discussion, and free debate what is right and what is wrong, what actions are correct and what actions are not correct, truly achieving the goal of educating oneself. The students used Mao Zedong Thought to educate and arm themselves, deeply realizing that anarchist trends interfered with and obstructed the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and resolutely broke with anarchism. A student named Guo Guirong from Class 1 of Grade 3, used to think that as long as one had the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to make revolution, one was following Chairman Mao's words and being loyal to Chairman Mao. He was not interested in resuming classes and making revolution and rarely went to school. When classmates criticized him, he emphasized the need to educate oneself and liberate oneself in the great winds and waves and debated with the classmates who criticized him. In Guo Guirong's mind, running around outside, charging here and there, was the way to make revolution, and sitting down to resume classes and make revolution was not meaningful. Under the influence of this wrong thinking, in August last year, Guo Guirong and a few classmates ran to another place to play for more than a month. He participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, studied "Opposing Liberalism," and read "There are no principles of collective life in one's mind, only free and easy attitudes" and felt that Chairman Mao's criticism hit the nail on the head. He decided not to adopt a liberal attitude towards himself. He fiercely criticized his private thoughts, examined his mistakes of going out without asking for leave, and realized that this anarchist behavior was a manifestation of disloyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He exposed his private thoughts thoroughly, criticized his private thoughts resolutely, and corrected his mistakes quickly. During the Spring Festival this year, he asked for leave to return to his hometown in Zhi Jin County. In the last few days of the holiday, the mountains of Zhi Jin were covered with snow and ice, and the roads were frozen, and the buses stopped running. Guo Guirong, in order to return to school on time to make the educational revolution, braved the snow and walked more than 150 miles. Revolutionary teachers and students deeply understood Chairman Mao's instruction from this student's transformation: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois thoughts in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key problem for the victory of the Cultural Revolution."

	The graduates of Guiyang Thirteenth Middle School, in the battle to suppress the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois cliques and overcome anarchist trends, raised the issue of whether to correctly treat the problem of educating oneself to the height of being loyal to Chairman Mao or not. They said, to be loyal to Chairman Mao for life, one must criticize private thoughts and revisionism for life, and use Mao Zedong Thought to educate oneself for life; without Mao Zedong Thought, talking about educating oneself would turn into indulging oneself, which would inevitably make one sink deeper and deeper into the anarchist quagmire. They enthusiastically praised the Mao Zedong Thought study class, believing that the study class is the best place for educating oneself. Li Xiaoli, who was one of the earliest revolutionaries to rebel against the bourgeois reactionary line at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, later had a sense of pride, and the thought of "unique revolution" emerged. As a result, she was influenced by the anarchist trend. She said in the study class with deep feelings that Chairman Mao most believed in the masses, letting the masses educate themselves, which is the greatest trust and the greatest encouragement to us. We must not disappoint Chairman Mao's sincere expectations, correctly treat ourselves, strictly demand of ourselves, and always use Mao Zedong Thought to arm ourselves, criticize private thoughts and revisionism, and ignite a revolution in the depths of our souls. Some people misunderstood the great significance of educating oneself, using this sentence as a shield to resist criticism and self-criticism, rejecting others' education of oneself and not educating oneself, which is actually pursuing bourgeois liberalization. As a result, it harmed oneself and endangered the revolution.

	The revolutionary youngsters of the junior high school graduating class at Guiyang Thirteenth Middle School, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, criticize anarchism, and truly achieve the goal of educating oneself. They expressed that as long as they stay in school for one more day, they will use the school as a battlefield, insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to educate themselves for one more day, with the highest revolutionary consciousness and the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, actively participate in the educational revolution, and vow to be proletarian revolutionaries who will carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, contributing their strength to the educational revolution.

### 自己教育自己，就是用毛泽东思想教育自己  贵阳十三中学初中毕业班的革命小将，通过毛泽东思想学习班的学习，一致认为：自己教育自己，绝不是谁也不能管自己，更不是用无政府主义来放纵自己

　　自己教育自己，就是用毛泽东思想教育自己
    贵阳十三中学初中毕业班的革命小将，通过毛泽东思想学习班的学习，一致认为：自己教育自己，绝不是谁也不能管自己，更不是用无政府主义来放纵自己
    新华社贵阳十七日电 应当怎样正确理解伟大导师毛主席“自己教育自己”的教导？贵阳十三中学初中毕业班的革命小将通过在毛泽东思想学习班的学习一致认为，自己教育自己，就是用毛泽东思想来教育自己、武装自己，而绝不是谁也不能管自己，更不是用无政府主义来放纵自己。
    贵阳十三中学从去年三月开始复课闹革命以来，初中毕业班的学生中就在争论着怎样正确理解毛主席“自己教育自己”的教导。最近他们通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判了“现在是自己教育自己，谁也管不着谁”等无政府主义思想，统一了对“自己教育自己”的认识。现在全校初中三个毕业班的一百八十五名毕业生，全部坚持到校复课闹革命。搞完毕业鉴定后，全体毕业生还继续到校，服从校革命委员会的统一安排，有的下厂劳动锻炼，有的负责接待新生，有的担任低年级学生的辅导员。他们和全校革命师生一起，把学校的复课闹革命搞得热气腾腾。革命小将们纷纷表示决心紧跟伟大导师毛主席的战略部署，为贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，作出新的贡献。
    在办毛泽东思想学习班以前，由于无政府主义思潮的影响，毕业班的学生到校人数最少，课堂纪律最差。教师、班干部动员他们复课闹革命，他们就说现在是“自己教育自己”，学校里管不着他们。
    但是，毕业生中间的一部分积极分子，例如三年级二班“驱虎豹”战斗队的八名革命小将，坚持天天到校，积极参加教育革命。班里其他学生不到校，他们就到同学家里去访问，和这些同学一起学习毛主席著作，动员他们回校，为教育革命作出贡献，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。有的教师因为对学生中的无政府主义倾向有意见，不愿上课，“驱虎豹”的同学们就登门去请。
    有一次，他们去请一个教师，这位教师气虎虎地说：“你们自己教育自己嘛！”当场，同学们就和教师一起学习毛主席的教导：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”并对这位教师说，复课闹革命，是毛主席发出的伟大号召，教师不上课，还叫同学们自己教育自己，你是怎样听毛主席的话的？有的同学提出，希望这位教师自己首先以毛泽东思想为武器，好好斗私批修，自己先教育教育自己。学生们尖锐而中肯的批评，使这位教师改变了态度，积极地担起了革命教师应尽的职责。
    毛主席教导说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”贵阳十三中学革命委员会遵照毛主席的教导，针对学生中的无政府主义倾向，专门为毕业生举办了一期毛泽东思想学习班。毕业生们在学习班上反复学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示和“老五篇”，用毛泽东思想之矢，去射无政府主义思想之的，让同学们在学习讨论和自由辩论中，去识别那些是对的，那些是错的，那些做法正确，那些做法不正确，真正达到了自己教育自己的目的。同学们自己用毛泽东思想教育自己，武装自己，深刻地认识到无政府主义思潮干扰和阻碍了全面落实毛主席的最新指示，就坚决同无政府主义决裂。三年级一班的学生郭贵荣，过去认为只要有敢想、敢说、敢干、敢革命的精神，就是听毛主席的话，就是忠于毛主席。他对复课闹革命不感兴趣，很少到学校里去。同学们批评他，他就强调要在大风大浪里自己教育自己，自己解放自己，并和批评他的同学辩论。在郭贵荣的心目中，在外面东奔西跑，这里冲冲那里冲冲，才是干革命的样子，坐下来复课闹革命，意思不大。在这种错误思想的支配下，去年八月，郭贵荣和几个同学，一道跑到外地玩了一个多月。他参加了毛泽东思想学习班，学了《反对自由主义》，读到“心目中没有集体生活的原则，只有自由放任”时，他感到毛主席的批评，正击中了自己的要害。他决心对自己不再采取自由主义的态度。他狠狠地斗了自己的私心，检讨了自己不请假外出的错误，认识到这种无政府主义的行为，就是对伟大领袖毛主席、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线不忠的表现。他亮私亮得彻底，斗私斗得坚决，改正也改得迅速。今年春节期间，他请假回织金县老家，假期快满那几天，织金山区风雪弥漫，公路结冰，客车停驶。郭贵荣为了按期回到学校搞教育革命，冒着风雪，步行了一百五十多里。革命师生从这位同学的转变中，更加深刻地领会了毛主席的教导：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”
    贵阳十三中的毕业生们，在围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性、克服无政府主义思潮的战斗中，把是否正确地对待自己教育自己的问题，提高到对毛主席忠不忠的高度来认识。他们说，要一辈子忠于毛主席，就要一辈子斗私批修，一辈子用毛泽东思想来自己教育自己；离开毛泽东思想空讲自己教育自己，那就变成了自己放纵自己，那势必在无政府主义的泥坑里越陷越深。他们热情地歌颂毛泽东思想学习班好，认为学习班是自己教育自己的最好场所。李筱莉在文化大革命初期，是全校最早起来造资产阶级反动路线反的革命小将。后来有了骄傲情绪，“唯我独革”的思想抬头，结果受到了无政府主义思潮的影响。她在学习班里深有所感地说，毛主席最相信群众，让群众自己教育自己，这是对我们的最大信任，也是对我们的最大鞭策。我们决不能辜负毛主席的殷切期望，要正确地对待自己，严格地要求自己，时时刻刻都要用毛泽东思想武装自己，斗私批修，在灵魂深处爆发革命。有的人曲解了自己教育自己的伟大意义，拿这句话来做抵制批评与自我批评的挡箭牌，既拒绝别人教育自己，又不自己教育自己，这实际上是搞资产阶级的自由化。结果，既害了自己，更危害了革命。
    十三中学初中毕业班的革命小将们，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，活学活用毛泽东思想，批判了无政府主义，真正做到了自己教育自己。他们表示，只要留在学校一天，就要以学校为阵地，坚持用毛泽东思想教育自己一天，就要以最高的革命自觉，最大的革命热情，积极参加教育革命，誓做把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，为教育革命贡献自己的力量。
