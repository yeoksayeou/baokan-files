The Indian reactionary government, under the control of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, has openly stated in its 1968-1969 budget that it will intensify the exploitation of the Indian people, increase military spending, expand military armaments, and actively pursue its anti-China and oppressive policies towards other neighboring countries.

According to a report from New Delhi by Xinhua News Agency, Indian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Morarji Desai presented the 1968-1969 budget to the parliament on February 29. The budget shows that the Indian reactionary government will increase the already unbearable military burden on the Indian people to 10.15 billion rupees (approximately $1.353 billion), an increase of 4.5 billion rupees compared to the 1967-1968 fiscal year. Thus, the military expenditure of the Indian reactionary government is nearly three times that of the 1960-1961 fiscal year, the year before it launched a large-scale attack on China in 1962. The Indian reactionary government, under the direction of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, is crazily increasing military spending, which is one of the important reasons for the worsening economic situation and the miserable living conditions of the Indian people in recent years.

Desai also said many deceitful things when presenting the budget. He shamelessly claimed that the Indian economy has improved and that the 1968-1969 fiscal year will be a "year of recovery." He also boasted about the "harvest" of Indian agriculture last year. However, Desai simultaneously announced that the food ration for the Indian people in the 1968-1969 fiscal year will be even lower than the average amount from 1961 to 1963 or 1963 to 1965. The Indian government plans to import 7.5 million tons of grain, similar to the previous two fiscal years. This indicates that the Indian sellout government will continue to open its doors to U.S. imperialism, willingly allowing the U.S. to dump grain, disrupt Indian grain production, and further control India.

    印度反动政府增加军费压榨人民
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：在美帝和苏修控制下的印度反动政府，在一九六八——一九六九年度预算中公开表示要加紧压榨印度人民，增加军费，扩充军备，积极推行它的反华和欺压其他邻国的反动政策。
    印度副总理兼财政部长德赛二月二十九日在议会提出的一九六八——一九六九年度预算，表明印度反动政府将把印度人民已经难以忍受的军费负担，再增加到一百零一亿五千万卢比（约合十三亿五千三百万美元），比一九六七——六八年度增加四亿五千万卢比。这样，印度反动政府的军费开支，比它在一九六二年向中国发动大规模进攻的前一年度的军费开支，即比一九六○——六一年度，几乎增加了三倍。印度反动政府在美帝苏修的指使下疯狂地增加军费，是近年来印度经济情况比以前更加恶化，人民生活更加悲惨的重要原因之一。
    德赛在提出预算时还说了许多骗人的鬼话。他厚着脸皮胡说什么，印度经济情况好转了，一九六八——六九年度将是“恢复年”。他还大肆吹嘘去年印度农业“丰收”。但是，德赛同时宣布，在一九六八——六九年度，印度人民的口粮将比一九六一年至一九六三年或一九六三年至一九六五年期间的平均数量还要低。印度政府打算象前两个年度一样，进口七百五十万吨粮食。这表明，印度卖国政府将继续向美帝国主义打开大门，甘心情愿让美帝倾销粮食，破坏印度的粮食生产，进一步控制印度。
