The South Vietnamese military and civilians, who have achieved a great victory in the recent Lunar New Year battles, have continued to display their brave and tenacious fighting spirit. Undeterred by fatigue and sacrifice, they have been pressing onward to victory, continuously striking the enemy on the vast battlefield of South Vietnam and achieving many new victories.

In the eastern region of Route 9 in Quang Tri Province, the military and civilians have been closely coordinating with those in the western region who are besieging and repeatedly attacking the enemy in the Khe Sanh area. In late February and early March, they launched fierce attacks on enemy bases such as Vinh Loc and Dong Ha, repeatedly ambushed enemy forces conducting "search and destroy" missions near Yung Ling, and continued to besiege many enemy strongholds and outposts, cutting off several roads, and frequently attacking enemy water transport convoys. The enemy has suffered heavy losses.

Statistics show that from February 21 to 29, the military and civilians in this region engaged in more than 90 battles, killing and capturing over 760 enemy soldiers, destroying 22 military vehicles, shooting down or destroying 19 aircraft, and sinking or damaging 50 ships. Following this, from March 1 to 13, the military and civilians in the eastern region of Route 9 continued their efforts, killing over 860 enemy soldiers, shooting down 4 aircraft, sinking 7 military ships, and destroying 4 tanks and armored vehicles.

In Gia Dinh Province, the military and civilians of Go Vap District, following their significant victories in the Lunar New Year, fought bravely from February 27 to March 8, attacking enemy bases and repelling multiple enemy counterattacks. They killed 600 enemy soldiers (including 551 American invaders), destroyed 24 tanks and armored vehicles, and shot down 18 aircraft. In the battles on February 27 and 28 against the Dong Nhi, Trung Hoa, and My Quynh outposts, as well as in the battles in the western Xinh Thinh Commune and on Route 1, the military and civilians of Go Vap District alone killed nearly 400 enemy soldiers.

On March 13, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Kon Tum Province ambushed an enemy convoy on Route 14, destroying or damaging all 42 military vehicles and 8 tanks escorting the convoy, annihilating many enemy soldiers on the vehicles.

On March 11 and 12, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Phu Yen Province attacked the enemy near the provincial capital of Tuy Hoa and repelled multiple enemy counterattacks, killing over 550 enemy soldiers, including an entire battalion, a company, and three platoons, and severely damaging another battalion and three companies.

On March 11, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Nam Province launched simultaneous attacks on two enemy strongholds in Kien Giang County. Preliminary reports indicate that they killed or wounded over 160 American soldiers from the 3rd Battalion of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade, and destroyed 14 aircraft and 2 tanks.

Previously, the local forces and guerrillas of Kien Giang and Thuan Phuoc Counties launched four attacks on enemy strongholds and "strategic hamlets" over four days (March 3, 4, 6, and 7), killing over 100 enemy soldiers, destroying or damaging 12 tanks and armored vehicles, and demolishing 4 bunkers.

In the early hours of March 9, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Binh Dinh Province attacked an enemy vehicle parking lot near the city of Qui Nhon, destroying or damaging 15 military vehicles of various types and annihilating an entire company of American invaders after a fierce one-hour battle.

On March 10 and 11, the artillery units of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Ninh Thuan Province launched heavy artillery strikes on enemy military and political headquarters in the provincial capital of Phan Rang and the Trung My military district, inflicting significant losses on the enemy.
