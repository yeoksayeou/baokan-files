The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." This is a great truth known to all. However, when some comrades encounter specific work, they still habitually discuss things on a case-by-case basis, with their minds full of progress, numbers, and targets, seeing only things and not people. In this way, the positive factors of people cannot be mobilized, and specific work will definitely not be done well.

This letter from a reader, although it discusses how to formulate advanced production targets, actually reminds us once again that even in the busy spring plowing season, we must never forget to emphasize proletarian politics and first arm the community members and cadres with Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought in command, all difficulties can be overcome, and this year's spring plowing battle will surely be won.

Every spring before plowing, the commune and brigade, production teams all formulate production plans and implement production targets. This year, during the discussion of spring plowing production, some comrades said that only with advanced targets can there be advanced production; once the targets are implemented, production can be easily managed. However, some comrades said that this is just talking about production without emphasizing politics and Mao Zedong Thought.

Due to differing views on this issue, we organized a discussion among the commune and brigade cadres on the question of what to rely on to implement production targets. Through the discussion, everyone realized that to have advanced production, one must have advanced thinking. Only by carrying out the ideological revolution of the people can the production targets be advanced and truly implemented. If one only talks about production without emphasizing politics and does not use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the people's minds, not only will the production targets not be advanced, but they will also not be implemented.

During the discussion, many comrades shared their personal experiences with vivid examples.

Comrades from Sanmen Guo Jia Brigade said that advanced production targets must be completed by people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao calls on us to "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and do all work better." After studying this latest directive from Chairman Mao, the broad masses of cadres and community members in our brigade are spirited, full of fighting spirit, and work hard from dawn to dusk to prepare for plowing. Some cadres also mentioned that they originally had personal desires and did not want to be cadres anymore, not caring about collective production; after studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, they felt enlightened and determined to forever take the lead in grasping revolution and promoting production.

Comrades from Xinglong Brigade said that Chairman Mao's latest directive is the most powerful. Wherever it is applied, it works. Take our brigade, for example. After studying the latest directive, everyone united to prepare for plowing, helping each other, thinking together, and working together, making the preparation work better than any other year.

This discussion has great educational significance for us commune cadres. In the past, we only knew how to focus on targets and urge numbers, using telephones and reports to direct production, rather than using Mao Zedong Thought to lead production. As a result, targets often fell short. This year, comrades from the People's Liberation Army helped us organize study classes, arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought and promoting the ideological revolution of the people, making production thrive. This made us further understand the great truth that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." In the future, we will further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything, and turn the entire commune into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

### 落实先进的生产指标靠什么？

    落实先进的生产指标靠什么？
    毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”这是大家都熟知的伟大真理。但是，某些同志一接触到具体工作的时候，仍然习惯于就事论事，满脑子是进度、数字、指标，就是见物不见人。这样，人的积极因素调动不起来，具体工作肯定做不好。
    这封读者来信虽然谈的是如何制订先进生产指标的问题，实际上是再一次提醒我们，春耕再忙，也要念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，也要首先用毛泽东思想武装社员和干部的头脑。毛泽东思想挂了帅，什么困难都能克服，今年春耕这一仗一定能打胜。　——编　者
    每年春耕前，公社和大队、生产队都要制订生产计划，落实生产指标。今年在讨论春耕生产时，有的同志说，有了先进的指标才有先进的产量；指标落实了，生产就好抓了。但是，有的同志说，这样就生产谈生产，就是不突出政治，不突出毛泽东思想。
    由于对这个问题的看法有分歧，我们组织公社和大队干部，就落实生产指标靠什么的问题，进行了一场讨论。通过讨论，大家认识到要有先进的产量，必须有先进的思想，只有搞好人的思想革命化，生产指标才能先进，才能真正落实。如果单纯地就生产谈生产，不突出政治，不用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，生产指标不但不可能先进，而且也落实不了。
    在讨论的过程中，很多同志都用生动的事例，畅谈了自己的切身体会。
    三门郭家大队的同志说，先进的生产指标，就是要靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的人去完成。毛主席号召我们“要抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好”。我们大队广大干部和社员学习了这一条最新指示以后，精神焕发，斗志昂扬，起早贪黑搞备耕。有的干部还谈到，自己原来有私心，不愿当干部了，对集体的生产不关心；学习了毛主席最新指示，感到心眼明，腰杆硬，决心永远为抓革命促生产打头阵。
    兴隆大队的同志们说，毛主席的最新指示威力最大，用到那里那里灵。就拿我们大队来说吧，学习了最新指示后，大家团结闹备耕，你帮我，我帮你，心往一处想，劲往一处使，备耕工作搞得比哪年都好。
    这场讨论，对我们公社干部教育意义很大。过去我们只知道抓指标，催数字，靠电话、表报去指挥生产，而不是用毛泽东思想去统帅生产，结果指标常常落空。今年，解放军同志帮助我们大办学习班，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，促进人的思想革命化，生产就搞得热火朝天。这使我们进一步懂得了“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”这一伟大真理。今后我们要更进一步活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，把全公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
