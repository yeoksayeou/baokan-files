On March 30, the editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good" published in the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and the *Liberation Army Daily* conveyed the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive: "The basic experience of revolutionary committees is threefold: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination of the revolution. Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected to the masses." Upon hearing this, we were overjoyed. We immediately spread this great news to the work areas, workshops, schools, and households at the fastest speed. Instantly, our mining area was in an uproar, and everyone, with hearts full of joy, shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Our revolutionary committee immediately held a meeting to study and discuss this. We all felt that Chairman Mao's great directive is the most profound, correct, and comprehensive summary of the experience of the proletarian revolutionary forces in seizing power during the Cultural Revolution. It is a new development of the proletarian dictatorship theory and has immense significance. Chairman Mao always points out the direction for us at critical moments of the revolution. When we proletarian revolutionaries rose up to seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, he timely instructed us on how to establish a temporary power organ combining the three revolutionary elements. Now that we have established the revolutionary committee, he continues to instruct us on how to properly exercise power and consolidate and develop the revolutionary committee. Chairman Mao's latest directive is our guideline for action and the fundamental principle for properly exercising power. We will definitely carry it out to the letter.

From our struggle practice, we deeply feel that the new revolutionary power implements the three-in-one combination, which is the fundamental guarantee for the revolutionary committee to stand unshakable. In our Ertaozhuang revolutionary committee, there are representatives of the revolutionary masses, who are revolutionary fighters with practical experience and close ties with the masses. This enables our revolutionary committee to take root among the masses and have a broad mass base. Our revolutionary power has injected new blood, and we can better cultivate revolutionary successors. The participation of military representatives in our revolutionary committee provides a strong backbone and support. The military comrades are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao closely, emphasize proletarian politics, and are good at handling living thoughts. They bring us excellent revolutionary traditions and styles, enabling us to learn directly from the military and strengthen our ideological revolutionization. We have liberated and combined the original mine party committee secretary and mine director, who have relatively rich revolutionary struggle experience and production management capabilities and can play a leading role. This ensures that we can do a good job in "grasp the revolution, promote production."

Implementing the three-in-one combination of the revolution enables the revolutionary committee to exert tremendous power in the struggle and lead the broad masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies. After the establishment of our revolutionary committee, based on Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," we firmly grasped class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, making the revolutionary committee increasingly consolidated in class struggle. After learning Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, we realized that only by grasping the "heads" can we grasp the picks, shovels, and spades. We took "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and drove out bourgeois, petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, allowing proletarian party spirit to settle in our minds. We often study and analyze the class struggle situation, actively attack the class enemies, carry out revolutionary criticism, and severely criticize the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Ertaozhuang, greatly enhancing the class consciousness of the revolutionary masses. We exposed the class enemies' plot to use fame, power, and wealth as bait to corrupt some leaders of our revolutionary committee. "Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Because we firmly grasped class struggle and revolution, we thus promoted production. In the first quarter of this year, the entire mine completed the state plan eight days ahead of schedule, creating the highest monthly production record since the mine's establishment. Everyone said this is a powerful proof of the good revolutionary committee and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, we will definitely take Chairman Mao's latest directive as our guideline, further grasp the ideological and organizational revolutionization of the revolutionary committee, and strive to make the revolutionary committee a strong command center for learning, executing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought.

    光辉的总结　英明的指针
    山东省枣庄市矿务局陶庄煤矿革命委员会
    三月三十日，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》社论《革命委员会好》传达了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”我们听后无比欢欣鼓舞。我们立即以最快的速度把这一最大的喜讯传达到工区、车间、学校和家庭中去。顿时，我们矿区沸腾起来了，大家怀着万分喜悦的心情，一千遍一万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    我们革委会立即举行会议学习讨论，大家感到：毛主席这一伟大指示，是对我们无产阶级革命派在文化大革命中夺权掌权经验最精辟、最正确、最全面的概括，是对无产阶级专政学说的新发展，具有极其伟大的意义。毛主席总是在革命的关键时刻给我们指出前进的方向。当我们无产阶级革命派起来向党内一小撮走资派夺权的时候，他老人家及时教导我们如何建立革命三结合的临时权力机构。当我们成立了革命委员会，他老人家又继续教导我们如何掌好权用好权，巩固和发展革命委员会。毛主席的这一最新指示，是我们革委会行动的指南，是掌好权用好权的根本。我们一定不折不扣地执行。
    我们从斗争实践中深深地体会到，新的革命政权实行三结合，是使革命委员会立于不败之地的根本保证。我们陶庄矿革委会中有革命群众的代表，他们是有实践经验的革命战士，与群众有密切的联系，这就使我们革委会能扎根于群众之中，有广泛的群众基础。我们革命政权中增添了新的血液，也能更好地培养革命接班人。我们革委会中有解放军代表参加，就有了坚强的后盾和支柱。解放军同志无限忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席，突出无产阶级政治，善于抓活思想。他们给我们带来了优良的革命传统和作风，使我们能直接地向解放军学习，加强思想革命化。我们解放并结合了原矿党委书记和矿长，他们有较丰富的革命斗争经验和生产管理能力，能发挥骨干作用，我们在搞好“抓革命，促生产”上就更有了保证。我们革委会建立的时间虽然不长，但已深切地感到，革命的三结合就是好。
    实行革命的三结合，就能使革委会在斗争中发挥巨大的威力，带领广大群众向阶级敌人勇猛进攻。我们革命委员会成立后，根据毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓了阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争，使革命委员会在阶级斗争中不断得到巩固。我们学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导以后认识到，只有抓好“人头”，才能抓好镐头、锨头和铲子头。我们以“斗私，批修”为纲，开办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，把资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义扫地出门，让无产阶级党性在我们头脑中安家落户。我们经常研究分析阶级斗争形势，主动地向阶级敌人进攻，开展了革命的大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在陶庄的代理人的滔天罪行，大大提高了革命群众的阶级觉悟。我们揭露了阶级敌人妄图以名、权、利为诱饵，腐蚀我们革委会某些领导成员的阴谋。“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”，由于我们狠抓了阶级斗争，狠抓了革命，因而就带动了生产。今年第一季度，全矿提前八天完成了国家计划，创造了建矿以来平均月产量的最高纪录。大家都说，这是革命委员会好的有力证明，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们今后一定以毛主席最新指示为指针，进一步抓好革命委员会的思想革命化和组织革命化，为使革命委员会成为学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想的坚强指挥部而努力。
