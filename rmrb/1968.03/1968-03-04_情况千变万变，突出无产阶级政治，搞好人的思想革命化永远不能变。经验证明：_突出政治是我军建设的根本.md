No matter how the situation changes, emphasizing proletarian politics and promoting the ideological revolutionization of people must never change. Experience has proven that emphasizing politics is the fundamental principle of our military construction.

In 1963, our company was tasked with construction and repair work, with a deadline of seven months. Given the heavy workload, tight schedule, high-quality requirements, large number of new recruits, and few technical experts, it was objectively challenging to complete the task on time. The question arose: should we emphasize politics and complete the task through strengthening political and ideological work, or should we emphasize technical skills and complete the task through overtime work? During a party branch committee meeting, a heated debate ensued. A minority of the committee members argued that since the Fifth Company is an elite communications unit with a strong ideological foundation, and this task was being carried out under the direct supervision of higher authorities, failure to complete it excellently would affect the company's honor. Therefore, they advocated for reducing political study time and completing the construction task through overtime work. The majority, however, believed that while the Fifth Company has a relatively strong ideological foundation, emphasizing politics is the key to the company's construction. Regardless of the circumstances, we must vigorously promote the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, emphasize proletarian politics, adhere to the "Four Firsts," and address active thoughts. Everyone studied Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the guiding force and the soul, and that political work is the lifeline of all economic work. Through study, everyone's understanding deepened.

To help everyone deeply understand Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought, Comrade Zhang Guoheng, the party branch secretary, encouraged everyone to recall the company's history. Everyone remembered how, in the vast, desolate Gobi Desert, they worked in temperatures as high as 40 degrees Celsius in the summer and as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius in the winter, often wearing rubber boots while working on poles. At that time, the unit had few technical experts, and 80% were new recruits. Despite the extremely difficult conditions, because everyone had an unlimited love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they emphasized proletarian politics, fully mobilized the enthusiasm of both officers and soldiers, and completed the task of laying the main line from the heart of the motherland to the northwest in just one year. This further unified everyone's understanding and resolved to follow the path of emphasizing proletarian politics. No matter the circumstances, we must vigorously emphasize proletarian politics, promote the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and adhere to the "Daily Reading" and party day system, ensuring that these activities are not disrupted. Officers joined the soldiers in studying and transforming their thoughts. We insisted on emphasizing proletarian politics in all work. The company became a scene of fervent activity, with everyone emphasizing politics and actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Spirit becomes matter. The construction task was not only completed with better quality but also at a faster pace. When rushing to complete another construction task, a task scheduled for seven days was completed in four. Immediately afterward, we were tasked with renovating nine flat-roofed houses, originally planned to take a month, but it was completed ten days ahead of schedule. This fully demonstrated the immense power of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The struggle has made us deeply realize that in the construction of the company, there is a struggle between two military thoughts and two military lines. In periods when Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought was well implemented and proletarian politics were emphasized, all work advanced, the company made progress, and there were the fewest problems. In periods when political and ideological work was relaxed, military matters overshadowed politics, and Chairman Mao's proletarian military line was abandoned, all work regressed. Not only could tasks not be guaranteed to be completed, but various negative tendencies and problems also emerged. Therefore, no matter how the situation changes, emphasizing proletarian politics and promoting the ideological revolutionization of people must never change. We must wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to smash to pieces the fallacy of "technology first" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and forever march forward along Chairman Mao's proletarian military line.

    情况千变万变，突出无产阶级政治，搞好人的思想革命化永远不能变。经验证明：
    突出政治是我军建设的根本
    某部五连
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对伟大领袖毛主席关于政治建军的伟大思想，大肆鼓吹“技术第一”、技术“决定一切”的谬论，疯狂地反对突出无产阶级政治，反对突出毛泽东思想，反对“四个第一”。
    究竟是把政治思想工作放在第一位，还是把军事、技术放在第一位；在定任务、提要求时，究竟是突出政治，还是突出军事；政治和军事有了矛盾时，是军事为政治让路，还是政治为军事让路，这是毛主席的无产阶级军事路线和资产阶级军事路线斗争的焦点，我们必须认真对待。
    一九六三年十月，我们连担负了营建修缮任务，上级要求在七个月内完成。在任务重、时间紧、质量要求高、新兵多、技术骨干少的情况下，要按时完成任务，客观上有许多困难。是坚持突出政治，通过加强政治思想工作来完成？还是突出业务，靠加班加点的办法来完成？在党支部委员会讨论时，发生了激烈的争论。少数支委认为：五连是通信兵的尖子连队，思想基础好，这次又是在上级领导机关眼皮底下搞营建，如果任务完成不出色，就会影响连队的荣誉，因此主张减少一些政治学习的时间，用加班加点的办法完成营建任务。而多数支委认为：五连政治思想基础虽然比较好，但突出政治是连队建设的根本，不论在什么情况下，都应该大抓狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，抓好活思想。大家带着问题学习了毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”，“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”等教导，通过学习，提高了大家的认识。
    为了使大家深刻地领会毛主席的无产阶级建军思想，支部书记张国贤同志又启发大家回忆连史。大家谈起在那一望无际、荒无人烟的戈壁滩上架线时，夏天经常在四十度的高温下抬杆拉线，冬季则在零下三十多度穿着胶鞋上杆作业。当时部队技术骨干又少，百分之八十是新战士。尽管条件极端困难，但由于大家对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚，突出了无产阶级政治，充分调动了干部和战士的积极因素，奋战一年就圆满地完成了架设从祖国心脏通往大西北的干线任务。这使大家进一步统一了认识，决心走突出无产阶级政治的路。不管在什么情况下，我们都狠抓突出无产阶级政治，狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，坚持“天天读”和党日制度，做到雷打不动。干部深入到班和战士一同学习，一同改造思想。坚持在一切工作中突出无产阶级政治。连队是一片热气腾腾的景象，出现了人人突出政治，个个活学活用毛主席著作的新局面。
    精神变物质。营建任务完成得不仅质量比以前好，速度也比以往快。在突击完成另一项营建任务时，七天的任务四天就完成了。紧接着又担负了九间平房的翻修任务，原来计划一个月的时间，结果提前十天就完成了。这充分显示了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大威力。
    斗争的实践使我们深深地认识到：在连队建设中，存在着两种建军思想、两条建军路线的斗争。那一个时期毛主席的无产阶级建军思想贯彻得好，突出了无产阶级政治，各项工作就向前发展，连队就进步，问题就最少；那一个时期放松了政治思想工作，军事冲击了政治，离开了毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，各项工作就后退，不仅不能保证完成任务，还会出现各种各样的不良倾向和问题。因此，无论情况千变万变，突出无产阶级政治，搞好人的思想革命化，永远不能变。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，把中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“技术第一”的谬论，砸个稀巴烂，永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级建军路线奋勇前进。
