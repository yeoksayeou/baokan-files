	Eliminate Anarchism, Ensure Spring Ploughing

	After the Spring Festival this year, a few young people in Pingjie Brigade of Xinglong Commune in our county were influenced by anarchist thinking and did not work hard. Some played cards, visited relatives, and went out to see friends; others did not follow the correct leadership of the brigade cadres, argued over work points, demanded better treatment, and shirked heavy work. They even called such wrong behavior "breaking old frameworks" and "opposing slave mentality." A few cadres were afraid of offending people and did not dare to take the lead actively. Some old poor peasants watched this with concern and repeatedly asked the brigade and production team leadership to cast off their mental burdens, stand up straight, and strengthen leadership.

	The brigade leadership seriously studied the opinions of the old poor peasants and decided to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes from the brigade to the production team to resolutely eliminate the influence of anarchism. Participants in the study classes included cadres, old poor peasants, and young people. In the study classes, by thoroughly exposing the crimes of anarchism, finding its harms, and digging out its roots, everyone unanimously recognized that anarchism is a great enemy of the revolutionary masses and must be resolutely overthrown.

	After raising their awareness, everyone launched a fierce attack on anarchism. Those who were heavily influenced by anarchism all made heartfelt self-criticisms. Some cadres also examined their own thoughts of not daring to manage. For example, the brigade leader said: "I have a big ego and am afraid to manage, fearing to get burned on the left and scalded on the right, resulting in the spread of anarchism and affecting production. In the future, I will definitely uphold principles and fight against all kinds of bad tendencies, together with everyone to achieve a great harvest in agriculture this year." Some production team leaders originally thought that some members had serious anarchism and were hard to lead, and they themselves wanted to quit; after studying, they realized that their thoughts did not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings and actively took the lead in leading the revolution and production.

	After suppressing anarchism, the thought revolution of cadres and community members was promoted. A new revolutionary order was established, and Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution and promote production" was further implemented in this brigade. Now, all laborers in Pingjie Brigade are fully attending, and community members go to the fields as soon as it is light and do not return home until the sun sets. Cadres and community members are fighting together on the front line of spring ploughing, and everyone is determined to achieve a great victory in agricultural production.

	I think the approach of Pingjie Brigade is very good. At the current busy spring ploughing season, leadership at all levels must stand up straight to strengthen leadership to achieve a bumper harvest for the whole year.

　　清除无政府主义，搞好春耕生产
    今年春节后，我县兴隆公社平阶大队有少数青年受了无政府主义思潮影响，不好好劳动。他们有的打扑克、串亲戚、出外看朋友；有的不服从队干部的正确领导，争工分、闹待遇，挑轻躲重。他们还把这种错误的行为说成是“打破旧框框”、“反对奴隶主义”。有少数干部怕得罪人，不敢积极领导了。一些老贫农看在眼里，急在心里，再三要求大队和生产队的领导班子丢掉思想包袱，挺起腰杆，加强领导。
    大队领导班子认真研究了老贫农的意见，决定从大队到生产队都办毛泽东思想学习班，坚决肃清无政府主义影响。参加学习班的有干部、老贫农和青年。在学习班里，通过大摆无政府主义的罪状，大找危害，大挖毒根，大家一致认识到：无政府主义是无产阶级革命派的大敌，必须坚决打倒。
    认识提高以后，大家猛烈向无政府主义开炮。受无政府主义影响较大的人，都痛心地作了检查。有些干部也检查了自己不敢管的错误思想。如大队长说：我私心大，不敢管，左怕烧了，右怕烫了，结果让无政府主义泛滥，使生产受到影响。以后我一定坚持原则，同各种歪风邪气斗争，同大家一起夺取今年农业大丰收。个别生产队长本来认为有的社员无政府主义严重，不好领导，自己想不干了；经过学习，认识到自己的想法不符合毛主席的教导，又积极站出来领导革命和生产。
    围剿了无政府主义，促进了干部和社员的思想革命化。革命新秩序建立起来了，毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示在这个大队进一步落实了。现在，平阶大队的劳力全部出勤，社员们天一亮就下地，太阳不落不回家。干部和社员一同奋战在春耕生产第一线上，大家都决心要在农业生产上打一个大胜仗。
    我认为平阶大队的做法很好。在当前春耕大忙时节，各级领导班子一定要挺起腰杆来加强领导，才能夺得全年的农业丰收。　辽宁岫岩县　武通
