Managing Financial Power Well

After the seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary faction, the class enemy is using bourgeois ideology to corrupt us economically. This is a new trend in the current class struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All government workers should understand that embezzlement and waste are grave crimes." Now, we must further implement the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions of "building the country through thrift" and "saving to make revolution." We must resolutely oppose extravagance and waste, resist the bourgeois counter-revolutionary economic trends, strictly manage finance and currency, and economize on expenditures. Anyone who does not follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "building the country through thrift" and "saving to make revolution," and engages in extravagance and waste, is disloyal to Chairman Mao and commits a grave crime against the people.

Managing financial power well is not just about managing a few dollars. Further implementing the policy of saving to make revolution and resolutely economizing on expenditures is not just an economic struggle, but a serious political struggle. The class enemy is using every means to sabotage our socialist economy, aiming to politically sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and undermine the dictatorship of the proletariat. In opposing extravagance and waste and economizing on expenditures, a small number of enemies will inevitably come out to oppose us, using various excuses and methods. We must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance against this.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction takes control of financial power, we must further oppose factionalism. We are managing financial power for the proletariat, not for a faction, and certainly not for individuals. Every penny spent must be considered from the perspective of the entire proletarian class interest, thinking about whether it should be spent or not. In managing financial power, if factionalism is allowed to grow, it will inevitably lead to major mistakes.

In further promoting the mass movement of saving to make revolution, financial, banking, and financial personnel must stand at the forefront of the struggle, actively support the Cultural Revolution, and support socialist construction. They must firmly guard their posts, strictly follow policies and regulations, and resolutely oppose the waste of state resources and violations of financial discipline.

A new wave of production is about to arrive. By firmly grasping this class struggle on the economic front, we will further promote the revolutionization of people's thinking and the leapfrog development of production. All regions, departments, and units must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production, develop the economy, increase income, and promote the revolutionization of the savings movement. We must mobilize the masses to voluntarily comply with the regulations, formulate savings measures, and ensure that all savings measures are implemented and sustained.

### 掌好财权

专栏：各地报纸社论摘要

    掌好财权
    在无产阶级革命派掌权以后，阶级敌人在经济上用资产阶级思想来腐蚀我们，这是当前阶级斗争的一种新动向。
    毛主席教导我们：“应该使一切政府工作人员明白，贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪。”现在，我们一定要进一步贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“勤俭建国”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，坚决反对铺张浪费，抵制资产阶级反革命经济主义歪风，严格财政、金融管理，节约开支。谁不执行毛主席关于“勤俭建国”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，铺张浪费，谁就是对毛主席的不忠，就是对人民的极大的犯罪。
    掌好财权，不只是管好几个钱的问题。进一步实行节约闹革命，坚决节约开支，也不仅是一场经济斗争，而是一场严肃的政治斗争。阶级敌人千方百计破坏我们的社会主义经济，其目的就是要在政治上破坏无产阶级文化大革命，瓦解无产阶级专政。我们反对铺张浪费，节约开支，一定会有一小撮敌人跳出来，会用各种借口和手法来反对。对此，我们一定要保持高度的革命警惕性。
    无产阶级革命派掌管财权后，必须进一步反对小团体主义。我们是为无产阶级掌财权，不是为小团体掌财权，更不是为个人掌财权。每用一分钱，都要从无产阶级整个阶级利益出发，想一想究竟该不该花。在掌管财权的工作中滋长小团体主义，非犯大错误不可。
    在进一步开展节约闹革命的群众运动中，财政、银行人员和财务人员，更要站在斗争的前列，积极支持文化大革命，支持社会主义建设。要坚守工作岗位，坚决按政策和制度办事，坚决反对浪费国家资财和违反财经纪律的行为。
    一个生产新高潮即将到来了，狠狠地抓一抓经济战线上的这场阶级斗争，必将进一步促进人的思想革命化，促进生产的飞跃发展。各地区、各部门、各单位必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓革命，猛促生产，发展经济，增加收入，必须以革命化带动节约运动，发动广大群众，自觉地遵守制度，订出节约措施，并把各项节约措施条条落实，坚持下去。
