	Newly established revolutionary committees have a multitude of tasks to handle. What should they focus on?
	Focus on proletarian politics and hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.
	Never forget class struggle and foster a strong atmosphere of revolutionary criticism.

	Under the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary committee of the Shanhaiguan Iron Works in Hebei Province held a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the theme "Never Forget Class Struggle." This helped overcome the tendency to neglect politics and focus solely on production, strengthened the awareness of class struggle, and improved the revolutionary and production situation throughout the factory.

	The New China News Agency, Shijiazhuang, March 22 — The revolutionary committee of the Shanhaiguan Iron Works in Hebei Province, with the enthusiastic assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory, held a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the theme "Never Forget Class Struggle." This led the broad revolutionary masses of workers to focus on class struggle, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly implement the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. They are determined to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and turn the factory into a vibrant school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of workers at the Shanhaiguan Iron Works closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and bravely fought against the class enemy. In early November last year, they seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and established a temporary power organ, the factory revolutionary committee, composed of three elements: representatives of the revolutionary masses, representatives of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary cadres. Revolutionary committees in various workshops were also established one after another. Amidst the joyous celebration of victory, some comrades began to relax, thinking that since the power had been seized, the class enemy could no longer cause trouble, and it was time to catch their breath. Even within the revolutionary committee, some comrades developed the idea of "revolutionary success." Under this guidance, revolutionary criticism was relaxed, and the struggle against the capitalist roaders within the party was no longer carried out. Some workshops began to focus solely on production. However, the class enemy did not sleep. Some came out to support, praising the revolutionary committee for "tightly grasping production" and "having methods," even using money, cigarettes, and alcohol to curry favor and corrupt members of the revolutionary committee and revolutionary workers.

	The comrades of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory saw these situations and took them to heart. After analysis, they believed that after achieving the victory of seizing power, some leading comrades and revolutionary workers in the revolutionary committee relaxing class struggle was very dangerous. They immediately helped organize a Mao Zedong Thought study class for all members of the factory revolutionary committee and the directors of various workshop revolutionary committees. This study class, with the theme of Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction "Never forget class struggle," led everyone to discuss the question of "What should the revolutionary committee focus on after its establishment?" During the study class, everyone, in conjunction with the actual class struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in society and within the factory before and after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, studied Chairman Mao's theory, line, policies, and directives on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and studied many instructions from Vice Chairman Lin. Chairman Mao pointed out in his famous report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "Because of victory, there may arise in the party the mood of arrogance, the mood of self-congratulation, the mood of complacency, the mood of desiring ease and shunning hardship in our life. Because of victory, the people will express their gratitude to us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to flatter us." Chairman Mao's teachings sounded the alarm. They clearly realized that the establishment of the revolutionary committee did not mean the end of class struggle, just as Chairman Mao pointed out, "This is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li," "The road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous." "Any thought of relaxing the will to fight and any thought of underestimating the enemy is wrong."

	Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the members of the factory revolutionary committee and the directors of various workshop revolutionary committees, in the face of living class struggle facts, more deeply felt that the temporary power organ of the revolutionary three-in-one combination must firmly establish the character of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, unwaveringly follow the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, lead the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to continue to carry out revolutionary criticism, do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some comrades said, as soon as the revolutionary committee was established, I ran around everywhere to get raw materials and make plans, and the idea of focusing solely on production emerged in my mind again. I mistakenly thought that only by focusing on production could the authority of the revolutionary committee be enhanced. Now I realize that these wrong thoughts, if not overcome in time, will bring great harm to the revolution. They said, if the revolutionary committee does not focus on class struggle and does not put emphasizing proletarian politics in the first place, it is not a genuine proletarian revolutionary leading cadre. There are a thousand and one tasks to handle, and class struggle must be firmly grasped. The more victorious the situation, the more class struggle must be grasped. Whether or not to grasp class struggle is a major issue of whether the newly established revolutionary committee can be consolidated and whether we are truly loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao.

	The comrades of the Shanhaiguan Iron Works revolutionary committee, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory, immediately went deep into the masses, held a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the theme "Never Forget Class Struggle," and led the revolutionary workers of the entire factory to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit.

	During the study class, revolutionary workers extensively carried out "three-history" education activities. They spoke at length about the factory history of how capitalists cruelly exploited workers in the old society and the struggle history since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The walls around the factory and inside the workshops were covered with quotations from Chairman Mao on class and class struggle. The study class became a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating oneself and modifying and criticizing the bourgeoisie. Revolutionary criticism was carried out vigorously. They combined the struggle within the factory to criticize the reactionary fallacies of China's Khrushchev, such as the theory of the extinction of class struggle and the theory of peace within the party. Through criticism, everyone's eyes were opened, and they further recognized the reactionary nature of China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. At the same time, they exposed a class enemy who disguised himself and infiltrated the mass organizations. The broad revolutionary workers enhanced their awareness of the enemy and united more closely around the revolutionary committee. Many comrades said: The revolutionary masses must hold power well and use power well, and they must always maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance. They must always remember Vice Chairman Lin's instructions: "Never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought."

	The factory revolutionary committee led the revolutionary workers of the entire factory to combine the struggle to criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line with struggle, criticism, and transformation. They criticized and transformed while criticizing. The leading members voluntarily moved from the house to the simple office, and they also established a system of collective leadership, division of labor, and rotation of duty among standing committee members. The factory revolutionary committee, in addition to leaving one standing committee member on duty each day, sent the other standing committee members to the workshops to maintain close contact with the masses, often participate in production labor, and maintain the style of ordinary laborers.

	In the process of criticizing China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory repeatedly criticized the reactionary fallacies advocated by the capitalist roaders within the factory, such as "relying on experts, relying on money, and relying on blueprints" to run the factory. They carried out a thorough ideological revolution, further established the proletarian worldview of working for the revolution, and enhanced the enthusiasm for revolutionary technological innovation. The workers said, we innovate, not relying on heaven, not relying on earth, only relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and relying on our loyal hearts to the great leader Chairman Mao. They dared to think and act, and as soon as they said they would do it, they did it. They completed the overhaul of the No. 9 furnace, which was originally planned to take half a year, in just over two months.

	At present, the revolutionary situation in this factory is excellent. Revolutionary criticism is being carried out continuously and deeply, and the production of pig iron is increasing day by day. The broad revolutionary workers unanimously said that they must put the revolution in the first place, use the revolution to promote production, firmly grasp class struggle, foster a strong atmosphere of revolutionary criticism, and do a good job of production. They must firmly plant Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their minds.

    新生的革命委员会工作千头万绪应该抓什么？
    突出无产阶级政治　把毛泽东思想红旗举得高高的
    念念不忘阶级斗争　把革命大批判气氛搞得浓浓的
    宣化铁厂革委会在解放军帮助下，以“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”为专题举办毛泽东思想学习班，克服了忽视政治、只抓生产等倾向，加强了阶级斗争观念，全厂革命和生产形势大好
    新华社石家庄二十二日电　河北省宣化铁厂革命委员会在驻厂解放军支左人员的热情帮助下，以“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”为专题举办毛泽东思想学习班，带领广大革命职工狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判和本单位的斗、批、改，决心夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把铁厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    宣化铁厂无产阶级革命派在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向阶级敌人进行了英勇的斗争，去年十一月初，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构厂革命委员会。各车间革命委员会也先后建立起来。在欢庆胜利的锣鼓声中，有些同志开始麻痹起来，他们认为大权已夺过来了，阶级敌人再也翻不了天了，该喘口气了。甚至在革委会内部也有同志产生了“革命成功”的思想。在这种思想指导下，革命大批判放松了，对党内走资派也不再批斗了。有些车间开始出现了只顾抓生产的现象。但是，阶级敌人并没有睡大觉，有的出来捧场，说革委会对生产“抓的紧”、“有办法”，甚至用金钱、烟、酒拉拢腐蚀革委会成员和革命职工。
    驻厂解放军同志把这些情况看在眼里，记在心上。他们经过分析，认为在取得夺权胜利之后，革委会里有些领导同志以及革命职工放松了阶级斗争是很危险的。便立即帮助举办了厂革委会全体成员和各车间革委会主任参加的毛泽东思想学习班。这个学习班，以伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的光辉教导为专题，引导大家对“革委会成立之后应该抓什么”的问题展开讨论。在学习班上，大家结合革委会成立前后社会上和厂内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策和林副主席的许多指示。毛主席早在党的七届二中全会的著名报告中就教导我们：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。”“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”毛主席的教导，给大家敲起了警钟。他们清醒地认识到，革命委员会的建立，决不意味着阶级斗争的终结，正象毛主席所指出的，“这只是万里长征走完了第一步”，“革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”“任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，厂革委会成员和各车间革委会主任在活生生的阶级斗争事实面前更加体会到，革命三结合的临时权力机构，必须牢固地树立对伟大领袖毛主席的“忠”字，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，进一步落实毛主席一系列最新指示，带领全厂革命群众持续地开展革命大批判，搞好本单位斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。有的同志说，一成立革委会，我就到处跑原料，搞规划，单纯抓生产的观点又在我脑子里作怪了。我错误地认为只有把生产抓起来才能提高革委会的权威。现在认识到，这些错误思想如不及时克服，就会给革命带来很大损失。他们说，革委会不抓阶级斗争，不把突出无产阶级政治放在第一位，就不是真正的无产阶级的革命领导班子。工作千头万绪，一定要狠抓阶级斗争，越是在胜利的时候，越要抓阶级斗争。抓不抓阶级斗争，是关系到新生的革命委员会能不能巩固的大问题，是考验我们是不是无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的大问题。
    宣化铁厂革委会的同志们提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，在驻厂解放军的帮助下，立即深入到群众中去，以“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”为专题，大办毛泽东思想学习班，带领全厂革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入开展革命大批判，推动本单位的斗、批、改。
    在学习班上，革命职工们广泛开展“三史”教育活动。他们大讲旧社会资本家残酷剥削工人的厂史，大讲无产阶级文化大革命以来的斗争史。厂房四周，车间内外，墙壁上贴满了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的语录，学习班成了活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，斗私批修的战场。革命大批判轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。他们结合本厂的斗争实际，对中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“党内和平论”等反动谬论，展开了专题批判。通过大批判，大家擦亮了眼睛，进一步认清了中国赫鲁晓夫和党内一小撮走资派的反动本性，同时还把一个乔装打扮、混进群众组织内部的阶级敌人揪了出来。广大革命职工增强了敌情观念，更加紧密地团结在革命委员会的周围。许多同志说：无产阶级革命派要掌好权，用好权，一定要时刻保持高度的革命警惕，一定要牢记林副主席的指示：“念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。”
    厂革委会领导着全厂革命职工把狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线同斗批改结合起来，边批边改。领导成员在大批判中主动地从楼房搬到简陋的平房办公，并且规定了集体领导，分工负责以及常委轮流值班制度。厂革委会每天除留一名常委值班以外，其他常委都深入车间，与群众保持密切联系，经常参加生产劳动，保持普通劳动者的本色。
    在批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的过程中，全厂革命职工们反复批判了本厂党内走资派鼓吹“靠专家、靠金钱、靠图纸”办厂的反动谬论，大搞思想革命化，进一步树立起为革命做工的无产阶级世界观，提高了为革命大搞技术革新的劲头。工人们说，我们搞革新，不靠天，不靠地，只靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠我们对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心。他们敢想敢干，说干就干，仅用两个多月时间就胜利完成了原计划半年才能完成的九号炉大修任务。
    目前，这个工厂的革命形势一片大好，革命大批判正在持续深入地进行，生铁产量不断上升。广大革命职工一致表示，一定要把革命放在首位，以革命带动生产，狠抓阶级斗争，把革命大批判的气氛搞得浓浓的，把生产搞得好好的，让毛主席的最新指示在思想上牢牢地扎下根子。
