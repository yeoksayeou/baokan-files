	In evaluating whether one has truly learned Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, what standard should we use?

	Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "If you can apply Marxist-Leninist viewpoints to explain one or two practical problems, then you deserve praise and have achieved some success. The more things you can explain, the more universal and profound they are, the greater your achievements will be."

	The representatives of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works in Mudanjiang City, during their conference, went among the people to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and used Mao Zedong Thought to help solve practical problems that were urgently needed in the Cultural Revolution. They broke away from the rigid framework of meetings, taking the achievements of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to the people for verification, and personally practiced Chairman Mao's advocacy of the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice. This approach deserves praise.

	Currently, the movement to study Chairman Mao's works is surging to new heights nationwide. The most important thing now is whether we have truly learned or not. To truly learn, we must combine theory with practice, study and apply it actively, using Mao Zedong Thought to address various real problems in class struggle. Verifying our learning achievements in practical struggles is an exam without exams, a much more reliable exam.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members should face storms and see the world." The profound Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great storm and a great world for the masses' struggles. Such a great storm and great world is a great classroom for actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. We should throw ourselves into the great winds and waves of class struggle, consciously temper and transform ourselves, and strive even harder to study Mao Zedong Thought and more firmly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    不考试的考试

    对于马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，真正学到还是没有学到，拿什么标准来衡量呢？
    我们伟大的导师毛主席指出：“如果你能应用马克思列宁主义的观点，说明一个两个实际问题，那就要受到称赞，就算有了几分成绩。被你说明的东西越多，越普遍，越深刻，你的成绩就越大。”
    牡丹江市学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表，在会议期间，到群众中去，宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想帮助解决那些地方在文化大革命中迫切需要解决的实际问题。他们打破了开会的框框，把活学活用毛主席著作的成绩，拿到群众中去检验，亲身实践了毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风。这种作法，应当受到称赞。
    目前，学习毛主席著作的群众运动，在全国出现了新的高涨。现在最重要的，是真正学到还是没有学到的问题。要真正学到，就必须结合实际，活学活用，用毛泽东思想之矢，去射阶级斗争各种现实问题之的。在实际斗争中检验我们学习的成绩，这是不考试的考试，比考试过硬得多的考试。
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员应该经风雨，见世面”。极其深刻的无产阶级文化大革命，就是群众斗争的大风雨，群众斗争的大世面。这样的大风雨、大世面，是活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。我们应当投身到阶级斗争的大风大浪中去，自觉地锻炼自己，改造自己，更加努力地学习毛泽东思想，更加坚定地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
