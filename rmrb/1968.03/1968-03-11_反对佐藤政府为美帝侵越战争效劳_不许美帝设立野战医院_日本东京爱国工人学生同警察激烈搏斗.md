	Oppose the Sato Government Serving U.S. Imperialism's Aggression in Vietnam; Do Not Allow U.S. Imperialism to Establish a Field Hospital
	Japanese Workers, Students, and Citizens in Tokyo Clash with Police in Fierce Struggle

	Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: According to a report from the Oriental News Agency: Over 2,000 patriotic workers, students, women, and citizens in Tokyo resolutely opposed the U.S. imperialists' plan to establish a U.S. military field hospital in the northern district of Tokyo. From the afternoon of the 8th to late at night, they engaged in prolonged, fierce struggles with the armed police dispatched by the reactionary Sato government to suppress them.

	A group of patriotic students arrived at the west gate of the U.S. military barracks at 3 PM, cutting through the barbed wire at the entrance. The students continuously repelled the attacks of the fully armed police mobile units with stones and bottles. Another group of students went to the east side of the U.S. military barracks, breaking open a two-meter-long hole in the concrete wall and using stones to damage some of the equipment inside the barracks.

	In the evening, over 2,000 workers, students, and women held a rally and demonstration march near the U.S. military barracks. Among the demonstrators were contingents from the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters and the Japan Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, carrying banners that read, "Long Live the Invincible Thought of Mao Zedong!" and "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Some young people also carried banners of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam during the march.

	When the demonstration march reached near the U.S. military barracks, the police mobile units savagely beat the demonstrators and passersby with batons, injuring many demonstrators and citizens, and arresting 157 demonstrators, including workers and students. However, the workers and students were fearless. They fought back against the police with stones and sticks. Many nearby citizens cheered and encouraged the workers and students in their struggle, and many joined the demonstrators in throwing stones at the police. Despite the reactionary police's armed suppression, the demonstrators persisted in their struggle at the main gate of the U.S. military barracks and its surroundings until late at night.

　　反对佐藤政府为美帝侵越战争效劳　不许美帝设立野战医院
　　日本东京爱国工人学生同警察激烈搏斗
    新华社九日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本东京两千多名爱国工人、学生、妇女、市民等，坚决反对美帝在东京北区一带设立美军野战医院，从八日下午到深夜同佐藤反动政府派出前往镇压的武装警察进行了长时间的激烈搏斗。
    一队爱国学生下午三点钟就到达美军兵营的西门，切断了兵营大门口的铁丝网。学生们用石头和瓶子接连不断地打退了全副武装的警察机动队的进攻。另一队学生绕到了美军兵营的东面，把水泥围墙砸开了两米长的一个大洞，并且用石头砸坏了美军兵营内的一些设备。
    晚上，两千多名工人、学生、妇女等，在美军兵营附近举行集会和游行示威。在示威队伍当中，有打着“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“星星之火，可以燎原”旗帜的日中友好协会（正统）总部和亚非人民团结日本委员会的队伍。还有一些青年在游行时打着越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜。
    当游行队伍走到美军兵营附近的时候，警察机动队野蛮地用警棍毒打示威群众和路上的行人，使许多示威群众和市民受了伤，并逮捕了一百五十七名示威的工人和学生。但是，工人、学生毫不畏惧，他们用石头和棒子同警察进行搏斗。附近的许多市民用热烈的掌声鼓励工人和学生进行斗争，很多人和示威群众一起用石头反击警察。示威群众不顾反动警察的武装镇压，在美军兵营的正门和兵营附近坚持斗争，直到深夜。
