Hundreds of young people from French Guiana, Martinique, and French Guiana residing in France, along with French progressives, held a demonstration and march in Paris on the afternoon of the 19th. They protested against the impending trial of nineteen anti-colonial warriors from Guadeloupe by the French State Security Court.

The demonstrators held banners and chanted slogans such as "Down with French colonialism!" "Guadeloupe wants independence!" and "Release the patriots!"

The nineteen Guadeloupe patriots who are about to be tried were arrested by the French authorities last May for opposing French colonial rule. In addition, forty-nine Guadeloupe patriots have been sentenced to heavy penalties by the colonial courts of the French authorities.

    拉美青年抗议迫害瓜得罗普爱国者
    数百名旅居法国的法属瓜得罗普、马提尼克、圭亚那青年以及法国进步人士十九日下午在巴黎举行示威游行，抗议法国国家安全法院即将审讯十九名瓜得罗普的反殖民主义战士。
    示威群众高举着横幅，高呼：“打倒法国殖民主义！”“瓜得罗普要独立！”“释放爱国者！”等口号。
    即将被审讯的十九名瓜得罗普爱国者是因反对法国殖民统治于去年五月间被法国当局逮捕的。此外，还有四十九名瓜得罗普爱国者被法国殖民当局的法院判处了重刑。
