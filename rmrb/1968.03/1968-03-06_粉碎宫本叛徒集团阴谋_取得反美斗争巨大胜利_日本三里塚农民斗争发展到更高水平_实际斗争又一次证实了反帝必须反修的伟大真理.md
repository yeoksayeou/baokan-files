The farmers of Sanrizuka in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, have, after foiling the treacherous plot of the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) Miyamoto group, pushed their struggle against the construction of a U.S.-Japanese reactionary military airfield to a higher level. People say: "The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries have exposed themselves as paper tigers in Sanrizuka, where there are only a few thousand farmers."

As soon as one enters Sanrizuka, one can see the watchtowers erected at the village entrance and field boundaries, the iron buckets hanging on the trees by the road for sounding the alarm, and the warning signs in front of every house. The warning signs read: "Police and thugs of the construction company are not allowed to enter. We will not sell even an inch of our land." As soon as the police and plainclothes agents dare to enter the village, the alarm bells ring, and everyone shouts to drive them away. Since last October, when the thugs of the construction company forcibly drove in stakes, they were severely punished by the farmers. Since then, the police and thugs of the company dare not take a single step into the village. Workers from other places who come to support the Sanrizuka farmers' struggle praise: "Sanrizuka is the farmers' domain."

However, the great achievements made by the Sanrizuka farmers in their anti-American struggle are inseparable from their constant struggle against the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) Miyamoto group. They have, in actual struggle, verified the great truth that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism. When the Sanrizuka farmers' struggle began, the running dogs of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, the Miyamoto group, also came to Sanrizuka under the pretext of "supporting the farmers." At first, the farmers, not seeing through the true colors of the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist), accepted their participation in the "joint struggle" against the construction of the military airfield. In mid-August last year, the women of Sanrizuka bravely broke into the prefectural government building and lodged a strong protest against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The young workers who came to support the Sanrizuka struggle then resolutely joined the ranks of the sit-in struggle. The struggle lasted the whole night. However, on the same day, the leaders of the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) crowded into a propaganda car, not only daring not to support the farmers' actions but also cursing the farmers' sit-in struggle as "brainless" and shouting through the loudspeaker to "stop the sit-in!" The farmers, pointing at the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) members, angrily replied: "Cowards, get out of here!"

On October 10 last year, the Sato government sent in 2,000 armed police to protect the thugs of the construction company as they drove stakes around the airfield. Upon hearing the news, all the farmers and young people who came to support the farmers' struggle immediately rushed to the scene. Despite the brutal suppression by the police, they fought to the death to stop the staking work, showing great courage. An old farmer who participated in the action of the old people's squad said: "We old people will fight the enemy to the end. Our minds are made up. Even if the enemy's bulldozer crushes us under its wheels, we will not give up an inch of our land." However, on the same day, at the second staking site, a group of Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) members were there pretending to be active. When the police came and shouted at them, they immediately retreated more than fifty meters and stood on the hill, watching from afar as the enemy drove the stake into the ground. These facts made the Sanrizuka farmers realize that the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) was completely unreliable. The farmers pointed out: "The Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) came to us first of all to expand the circulation of the Red Flag newspaper and to solicit votes. They came to Sanrizuka to make money for themselves. They not only do not participate in the struggle, but when we fight the enemy, they pull our legs from behind."

As the struggle intensified, the true colors of the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) were increasingly exposed, while the friendship and unity between revolutionary young workers, patriotic students, and farmers grew stronger. This situation made the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) very anxious. Therefore, they conspired to sabotage the unity between the farmers and the young workers and patriotic students. At that time, the leaders of the Sanrizuka farmers' movement participated in the "Overthrow the Sato Cabinet Meeting" held by the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) headquarters and the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and other organizations in October and November. The young workers and patriotic students held a meeting in Sanrizuka to protest against the construction of the military airfield. The Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) frantically pressured the leaders of the Sanrizuka farmers' movement to sever their ties with the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) headquarters and patriotic students. After this plot failed, the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) crazily attacked and slandered these leaders, even spreading shameful rumors that "the leaders have secretly dealt with the government and sold the land," attempting to sow discord between the farmers and their leaders, split the anti-American movement, and sabotage the struggle in Sanrizuka.

The farmers of Sanrizuka could no longer suppress their anger and decided to drive the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) out of the struggle.

On December 15 last year, the Sanrizuka farmers held a meeting and issued a statement, publicly announcing that the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) would no longer be allowed to continue its sabotage activities in Sanrizuka, and at the same time exposing the truth about the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist)'s sabotage of the farmers' struggle. The leader of the Sanrizuka farmers' movement, Tomura Kazuo, said: The Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist) is no longer a friend of the farmers. It has completely stood on the opposite side of the farmers. More than a year of fierce struggle has enabled us to further distinguish between friends and enemies.

By eliminating the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist)'s sabotage and disruption from within and foiling the Japanese Communist Party (Revisionist)'s attempt to impose capitulationism on the farmers' struggle, the Sanrizuka farmers, with the powerful support of workers and patriotic students, have achieved great victories. The resolute struggle of the broad masses of farmers has forced the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' construction of the airfield to almost come to a complete halt. The first 4,000-meter-long runway of the airfield, which was originally scheduled to be completed in 1971 and was supposed to begin geological drilling this March, has not yet started surveying work, making it impossible to start drilling on schedule.

The farmers of Sanrizuka not only have organized themselves but have also become stronger in the struggle. Youth, women, old people, and children have all formed various action squads. They say proudly:

"We oppose the construction of a military airfield here. This is not only to protect our land but more importantly to prevent our land from being used by American imperialism to invade Vietnam, China, and Asia."

    粉碎宫本叛徒集团阴谋　取得反美斗争巨大胜利
    日本三里塚农民斗争发展到更高水平
    实际斗争又一次证实了反帝必须反修的伟大真理
    据新华社五日讯　东京消息：日本千叶县三里塚农民在粉碎了日修宫本集团的叛卖阴谋以后，已经把反对美日反动派修建军用机场的斗争推向更高的水平。人们都说：“美日反动派在仅有几千农民的三里塚，现出了纸老虎的原形。”
    一走进三里塚，就会看见树立在村口和地头的一个又一个的瞭望楼和挂在路旁树上的敲警报用的铁桶，以及每家门前的警告板。警告板上写道：“警察、机场建筑公司走狗莫入，誓死不卖一寸土地”。只要警察和便衣特务等一闯进村，立即警报齐鸣，人人喊打。自从去年十月机场建筑公司的走狗强行打标桩，受到农民严厉惩罚以后，警察和公司的走狗再也不敢迈进村内一步。从外地来支援三里塚农民斗争的工人赞佩地说：“三里塚是农民的天下。”
    然而，三里塚农民在反美斗争中所取得的巨大成就，是和他们不断同日修宫本集团作斗争分不开的。他们在实际斗争中，证实了反帝必须反修的伟大真理。当三里塚农民斗争刚一开始时，美日反动派的帮凶宫本集团，也打着所谓“支援农民”的幌子来到了三里塚。开始时，农民们看不清日修的真面目，便接受它们参加反对建筑军用机场的“共同斗争”。去年八月中旬，三里塚的妇女第一次勇敢地闯到县政府前面，向美日反动派提出强烈抗议。参加支援三里塚斗争的青年工人，接着也毅然参加了静坐斗争的行列。斗争坚持了一整夜。但是在这同一天，日修的头目们却挤在一辆宣传车内，不仅不敢支持农民的行动，反而咒骂农民的静坐斗争是“没有头脑”，并且通过扩音器不断叫嚷什么“停止静坐！”农民们指着日修分子愤怒地回答：“胆小鬼，滚开！”
    去年十月十日，佐藤政府出动两千名武装警察，保护机场建筑公司的走狗到三里塚打机场外围的标桩。全体农民和支援农民斗争的青年闻讯后立即跑到现场，不顾警察的残酷镇压，拚死地阻止了打标桩的工作，表现了大无畏的气概。参加老人行动队的一位老农民说：“我们老人要和敌人斗争到底，我们的决心下定了，就是敌人的推土机把我们压死在车轮下，我们也决不让出一寸土地。”但是，就在这同一天，在第二个打标桩的地点，有一伙日修分子在那里装模作样。当警察来势汹汹地到他们前面一叫嚷，他们立刻吓得退后了五十多米，站在山坡上，远远地看着敌人把这个标桩打在地里。这些事实，使三里塚农民认识到日修是完全靠不住的。农民们一针见血地揭露说：“日修到我们这里来，第一件事就是千方百计地扩大《赤旗报》订户，拉选票，他们是为了自己捞油水到三里塚来的。他们不仅不参加斗争，当我们同敌人斗争时，他们还拉我们的后腿。”
    随着斗争的激烈展开，日修的原形越来越清楚地暴露，而革命青年工人、爱国学生和农民的友谊和团结却日益增强。这种情况使日修大为惊慌。因此，他们就阴谋破坏农民和青年工人、爱国学生之间的团结。当时，三里塚农民运动的领导人在十月和十一月先后参加了日中友好协会（正统）总部、日本国际贸易促进协会等团体举行的“打倒佐藤内阁大会”。青年工人、爱国学生在三里塚举行了抗议修建军用机场的大会。日修就拚命地向三里塚农民运动领导人施加压力，一定要他们断绝和日中友好协会（正统）总部和爱国学生的联系。在这一阴谋未能得逞以后，日修便疯狂地攻击、诽谤这些领导人，甚至进行可耻的造谣，说什么“领导干部们和政府暗中进行交易，出卖了土地”，企图挑拨农民同他们的领导人的关系，分裂反美运动，破坏三里塚的斗争。
    三里塚的农民，再也按捺不住心头怒火，他们决定把日修从斗争的行列里清除出去。
    去年十二月十五日，三里塚农民举行大会并发表声明，公开宣布不准日修继续在三里塚进行破坏活动，同时公布了日修破坏农民斗争的真相。三里塚农民运动的领导人户村一作说：日修已经不是农民的朋友，它完全站到了农民的敌对方面，一年多严峻的斗争，使我们更进一步分清了敌友。
    由于清除了日修从内部的破坏和捣乱，粉碎了日修企图强加于农民斗争的投降主义，三里塚农民的斗争，在工人和爱国学生的有力支持下，取得了巨大胜利。广大农民的坚决斗争已迫使美日反动派修建机场的工作几乎全部陷于停顿。原来预定在一九七一年完成的第一条四千米的机场大跑道，本应从今年三月进行地质钻探。但是由于至今还没有开始测量工作，钻探根本无法按期开工。
    三里塚的农民不仅组织起来了，而且在斗争中越战越强。青年、妇女、老人、儿童，都成立了各种行动队。他们豪迈地说：
  “我们反对在这里建筑军用机场，这不仅是为了保卫自己的土地，更重要的是为了不让我们的土地被美帝国主义用来侵略越南、中国和亚洲”。
