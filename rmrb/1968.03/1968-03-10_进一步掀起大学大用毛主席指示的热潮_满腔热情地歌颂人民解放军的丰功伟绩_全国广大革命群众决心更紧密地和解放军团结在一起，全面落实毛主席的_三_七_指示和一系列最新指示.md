	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres across the country continued to hold various celebrations and study activities today, further stirring up the tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the March 7th Directive, and a series of latest instructions. With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they extensively discussed and praised the brilliant significance of the March 7th Directive, fervently praised the glorious achievements of the People's Liberation Army in implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of latest instructions over the past year. They expressed their determination to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unite more closely with the great People's Liberation Army, learn better from the great People's Liberation Army, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of latest instructions to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao, in the March 7th Directive, issued a great call: "The army should, in phases and batches, conduct military training for colleges, high schools, and upper grades of primary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, rectifying organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership organs, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. First, conduct pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually promote them. Also, persuade students to implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself, and during military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes. Except for the elderly and the sick, let these people participate to facilitate their reform. All these, as long as they are seriously carried out, the problems are not difficult to solve." The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army responded enthusiastically, studied diligently, propagated enthusiastically, executed resolutely, and defended bravely. Over the past year, in the "three supports, two militaries" work, they have established immortal merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad revolutionary masses across the country, reviewing the past year's battle course, excitedly said, the People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, is the most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, the most loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the most loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They study and apply Chairman Mao's works the best, execute Chairman Mao's instructions the most resolutely, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment the closest, and have set a brilliant example for us.

	Revolutionary workers in Beijing and Shanghai said, in the more than a year of the Cultural Revolution, it is the People's Liberation Army that has brought the great Mao Zedong Thought to us, and given us the most powerful support in politics; it is the People's Liberation Army that has helped us deeply understand that the proletarian revolutionary cadres must first have a loyal heart to Chairman Mao, and place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work; it is the People's Liberation Army that, in accordance with Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive, armed us with the thought of "only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself," helping us correctly handle cadres who have made mistakes, promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and consolidating the revolutionary great alliance; it is the People's Liberation Army that has helped us establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, raising our ideological revolutionization to a new level. An old worker from Tianjin's San Tiao Shi said, with the spiritual armor of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the strong support of the beloved PLA, we can achieve double victories in revolution and production. Revolutionary masses and students of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province said, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the PLA has brought Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of latest instructions to every unit, every family, and every individual, deeply into our hearts, greatly promoting the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Several dozen students from Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Changsha's Qing Shui Tang area excitedly said, we must learn from the great People's Liberation Army, and like the PLA, defend and resolutely implement the great leader Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of latest instructions, achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Representatives of revolutionary teachers and students attending the first session of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Advanced Collectives and Active Individuals Conference for Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought held a discussion on studying the March 7th Directive. They said with deep emotion: the PLA led us forward on the path indicated by the March 7th Directive, and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism was swept away, and the school's appearance changed greatly. Revolutionary teachers and students from 21 colleges and universities in the Xi'an area all praised the PLA with their personal experiences and feelings, saying that the PLA is a model in implementing Chairman Mao's great instructions.

	Revolutionary cadres and masses from many factories, schools, and organs in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Guizhou, Guangdong, Jilin, Liaoning, Zhejiang, Ningxia, Sichuan, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Xinjiang provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions expressed in meetings, reports, and experience-sharing sessions that they would learn from the PLA, take the PLA as an example, be loyal to the great leader of the proletariat Chairman Mao, and grasp the application of the great Mao Zedong Thought, further comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of latest instructions. Revolutionary teachers and students from Taiyuan Medical School expressed that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army," learn from the PLA's experience of holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learning from the PLA's tradition of emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and carrying forward the three-eight work style. At a celebration held by the Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee in Harbin City's middle schools, more than 190 representatives from middle schools unanimously expressed that they would strive to learn from the PLA, strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline. Revolutionary teachers and students from Guangxi Nationalities Institute pointed out in a discussion meeting that learning from the PLA is fundamentally about learning their unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, their unlimited loyalty to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	Revolutionary masses and students across the country expressed that they would resolutely implement Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive, enthusiastically support the PLA, and firmly support and help the PLA do the "three supports, two militaries" work well. A thousand and five hundred revolutionary teachers and students from Nanchang No. 9 Middle School held a support-the-army meeting and a military-civilian celebration. Revolutionary teachers and students and the PLA soldiers responsible for military training decided to further improve military-political training and resume classes to make revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students from Lanzhou's colleges and universities and the college military training team held a grand support-the-army, love-the-people meeting on the 9th to commemorate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive.

    北京、上海的广大革命职工说，在一年多来的文化大革命中，是人民解放军把伟大的毛泽东思想带给了我们，在政治上给了我们最有力的支援；是人民解放军帮助我们更深刻地懂得了无产阶级革命派掌权，首先必须对毛主席心怀一个忠字，把活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位；是人民解放军遵照毛主席的“三·七”指示，用“只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己”的思想武装我们，使我们正确地对待犯错误的干部，促进了革命的三结合，巩固了革命的大联合；是人民解放军帮助我们大办毛泽东思想学习班，进行斗私批修，使我们的思想革命化提高到了一个新的水平。天津市三条石的老工人说，有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的精神武装，有了亲人解放军的大力支持，就能取得革命和生产的双胜利。青海省各族广大革命群众和革命师生说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，解放军把毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，送到了每一个单位，每一个家庭，每一个人，送到了我们的心坎上，大大促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。长沙市清水塘地区的几十个毛泽东思想学习班的学员们激动地说，我们一定要向伟大的人民解放军学习，要象人民解放军那样誓死捍卫和坚定不移地执行伟大领袖毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
