Title: Fish and Water or Oil and Water?

The Chinese Communist Party, which has grown and strengthened in the midst of extremely complex and sharp class struggle, has a relationship with the masses comparable to that of fish and water, or seeds and soil. We Communist Party members must steadfastly follow the consistent teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, going into the masses' struggles to weather storms and gain experience, sharing the same breath and fate with the masses in their struggles. Only in this way can we be heart-to-heart with the masses, forever maintaining this life-and-death relationship between the Party and the masses. However, China's Khrushchev fundamentally opposes Party members from getting close to the masses, advocating that through closed-door "cultivation," one can produce "loyalty and love" for the masses. He advocates that "if Party cadres participate in labor, sweep the floor, and shovel some dirt, the masses' impression will change, the relationship will improve, and prestige will be enhanced, very clever indeed."

Sitting in a room humming "cultivation" hymns, then going to the edge of the masses' struggles to gild oneself and put on a show—will this "improve" the Party-mass relationship? This is sheer nonsense! A Communist Party member, if he does not go into the storms of the masses' struggles to fight shoulder to shoulder with them, will never become a close friend of the masses in his entire life. The other day, I went to a factory to support the left, and saw that the two revolutionary mass organizations in the factory had formed opposing factions, which made me very anxious. At that time, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on how Communist Party members "must be able to combine with the masses on any issue." I realized that only by going deep into the masses' struggles, seeking advice from the masses, and consulting with the masses, could I help the masses solve their problems. Therefore, I moved my bedding into the workers' dormitory and studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions with everyone, discussed problems, exchanged opinions, and handled the disputes between the two factions correctly according to Chairman Mao's teachings. In the end, both sides stopped their "internal war" and directed their struggle against the common enemy—China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The fighting friendship between me and the revolutionary masses of this factory was forged in the stormy class struggle. Following China's Khrushchev's "cultivation" tricks will not yield such results. Exposed, China's Khrushchev's "tricks" are nothing more than pretending to touch the hoe handle and having a reporter take a photo to be published, eating high-grade pastries and then pretending to go to a peasant's home to eat steamed buns. This is a trick of a complete hypocrite! What is called changing the "impression" of the "masses" is merely a trick used by bourgeois politicians to deceive people!

    鱼水相依还是油水分离？
    某部侦察连副指导员　陈学政
    在极端复杂尖锐的阶级斗争中发展壮大起来的中国共产党，和群众的关系好比是鱼和水的关系，种子和土地的关系。我们共产党员，只有坚定不移地遵照伟大领袖毛主席的一贯教导，到群众斗争中去经风雨，见世面，在群众斗争中和群众同呼吸，共命运，才能和群众心连心，永远保持党和群众这种生死与共的关系。可是中国赫鲁晓夫根本反对党员深入群众，鼓吹通过闭门“修养”，就会产生对群众的“忠诚热爱”，鼓吹“党员干部参加劳动，扫扫地，铲铲土，群众的观感就改变了，相应地关系就改善了，威信就提高，灵得很。”
    坐在房子里哼哼“修养”经，再到群众斗争的边沿去镀镀金，装装样子，党群关系就“改善”了吗？完全是胡说八道！一个共产党员，如果不到群众斗争的风雨里去和群众并肩战斗，一生一世也不会变成群众的知心朋友。前些日子，我去一个工厂支左，看到厂里两派革命群众组织形成对立，心里非常着急。当时，我反复学习了毛主席关于共产党员“无论在什么问题上，一定要能够同群众相结合”的教导，认识到只有到群众斗争的深处去，向群众请教，同群众商量，才可能帮助群众解决问题。于是，我把铺盖搬进了工人宿舍，和大家一起学习毛主席的有关指示，一起商讨问题，交换意见，一起按毛主席的教导正确处理两派之间的争论。最后，双方终于停止了“内战”，把斗争矛头一齐指向共同的敌人——以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派。我和这个厂的革命群众之间的战斗友谊，正是在阶级斗争的暴风雨中结成的。按照中国赫鲁晓夫的“修养”诀窍去做，是不会有这样的结果的。拆穿了说，中国赫鲁晓夫的“诀窍”，无非是一摸锄头柄就要记者给拍照登报，吃饱了高级点心再装样去社员家里啃窝窝头的“诀窍”，这彻头彻尾是伪君子的“诀窍”！所谓改变“群众”的“观感”，只不过是资产阶级政客做政治买卖的一种骗人把戏罢了！
