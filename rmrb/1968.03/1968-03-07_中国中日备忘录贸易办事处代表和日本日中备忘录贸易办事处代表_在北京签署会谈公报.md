	New China News Agency, March 6th: Representatives of the Chinese Liaison Office for Memorandum Trade and the Japanese Liaison Office for Memorandum Trade signed a joint communiqué in Beijing today.

	Both sides affirmed in the communiqué that the Three Political Principles and the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics are principles that must be adhered to in Sino-Japanese relations and are the political foundation for the relationship between the two liaison offices.

	The full text of the joint communiqué is as follows:

	Representatives of the Chinese Liaison Office for Memorandum Trade, Liu Xihuan, Wang Xiaoyun, and Sun Pinghua, and representatives of the Japanese Liaison Office for Memorandum Trade, dispatched by Mr. Matsumura Kenzo, Koi Jijitsu, Okazaki Kabeita, and Tagawa Seiichi, held talks in Beijing from February 8th to March 6th, 1968. Both sides, based on the principles of the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Mr. Matsumura Kenzo, exchanged views frankly and amicably on issues of mutual concern.

	Both sides believe that China and Japan are neighboring countries with a traditional friendship between their peoples. Promoting friendly relations between the two peoples and normalizing relations between the two countries not only meets the common aspirations of the peoples of China and Japan but also contributes to the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world.

	The Chinese side pointed out that the obstacles in Sino-Japanese relations, including those between us, are due to the hostile policies towards China pursued by U.S. imperialism and the Japanese authorities.

	The Japanese side expressed deep understanding of the Chinese side's position and stated that it would make further efforts to remove these obstacles and promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

	The Chinese side reiterated the insistence on the Three Political Principles and the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics in Sino-Japanese relations. The Japanese side expressed agreement. Both sides believe that the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics means that politics and economics are inseparable and mutually reinforcing, and that the improvement of political relations will facilitate the development of economic relations.

	Both sides unanimously affirmed that the Three Political Principles and the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics are principles that must be adhered to in Sino-Japanese relations and are the political foundation for our relationship, and declared their determination to continue to make efforts to adhere to the above principles and maintain this political foundation.

	Both sides reached an agreement on the memorandum trade items for 1968.
