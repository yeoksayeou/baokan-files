Study classes in the fields are good! During the busy spring ploughing season, large-scale study classes in the fields have been organized. Personnel, organization, and time have all been ensured. By linking theory with practice, the consciousness of poor and lower-middle peasants in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions has been heightened, making both revolution and production vigorous and solid.

With the start of spring ploughing, the Daxin Production Team encountered new problems in organizing study classes on Mao Zedong Thought: due to the need for spring ploughing work, the entire team was divided into six work groups for ploughing, seedling raising, and cattle herding, etc. Work locations were scattered, and work start times varied, making it difficult to ensure that participants in the study classes were in place and that time was well arranged. In response to these problems, with the help of the propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought from the Fourth Company of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, they followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "consult with the masses on all matters" and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied and decided to organize study classes on Mao Zedong Thought in the fields according to work types.

First, they organized the team members into study groups according to their work types and selected group leaders. Team cadres and instructors for studying the works of Chairman Mao were paired with each group. The study content was uniformly arranged by the team committee. Each group could flexibly use breaks and leisure time according to their group's ideological situation and work tasks, selecting and studying Chairman Mao's quotations and latest instructions that were relevant to their needs. Each study session focused on one viewpoint, criticized one black statement by the Chinese Khrushchev, engaged in one struggle against selfishness, and solved one practical problem. In the study classes, everyone was both a student and a teacher. Those who studied well were invited to teach. Their method of self-organizing, self-arranging time, and closely linking theory with practice achieved immediate results.

There are four advantages to organizing study classes in the fields:

First, ensuring personnel. No matter what work team members were engaged in, they could all participate in the study classes. Full-time team members who plough and raise seedlings studied in the fields; part-time team members who herd cattle studied by the roadside and on the mountainside; elderly team members who cooked and took care of children organized study classes at home. The cattle-herding group of thirteen team members, who previously could not participate in study classes, established a study group after organizing study classes according to work types. Group leader Liang Renquan often organized everyone to study while herding cattle. In the recent two study sessions, all thirteen members participated without exception.

Second, ensuring organization. No matter how complex the work types were or how scattered the team members were, the study classes were never disrupted. Recently, the team had eight to ten types of spring ploughing work, with team members scattered over an area of four to five li. It took thirty to forty minutes to gather everyone together. However, by adopting the method of organizing study classes according to work types, the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the struggle against selfishness and revisionism never stopped, and the study classes were still lively and vibrant. Even if individual team members changed their work, they could continue their studies by transferring from one study group to another.

Third, ensuring time. Organizing study groups according to work types resulted in smaller groups, making it easier to gather and arrange time. Everyone had more opportunities to speak during study sessions. No matter how heavy the workload was, study time was still guaranteed.

Fourth, achieving good results in struggling against selfishness and revisionism. Organizing study classes according to work types allowed for a better understanding of the thoughts of the students, timely discovery of problems, and quick solutions. Young female team member Liang Chunjiu was usually talkative and cheerful, but one day while raising seedlings, she suddenly became silent. Team member Zhang Mucang found out that she had been scolded by the team leader for not requesting leave to go to the city a few days earlier and was holding a grudge. During a break, Zhang Mucang sat with her on a dike and studied Chairman Mao's instruction that "anarchy does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people," raising her awareness. In the study class, she said with shame, "I went to the city without requesting leave because my mind was filled with selfishness, influenced by anarchist thoughts, and poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev's 'personal interests must be taken care of.'" From then on, she followed all work assignments, took the heavy burdens, and did the dirty work. Through such study classes, the fields became a good classroom for actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a good battlefield for struggling against selfishness and revisionism. Good people and good deeds in grasping the revolution and promoting production emerged continuously.

Now, the Daxin Production Team has achieved a situation of vigorously grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production. The fields are filled with the singing of quotations, and everyone is striving to be a pioneer in struggling against selfishness and revisionism and a hero in vigorously promoting spring ploughing production.

   田头学习班好！
   春耕大忙季节，大办田头学习班，人员落实，组织落实，时间落实，理论联系实际，提高了贫下中农落实毛主席最新指示的自觉性，把革命、生产搞得轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实
    春耕开始，田心生产队办毛泽东思想学习班遇到了新问题：由于春耕工作需要，全队分成犁田、育秧、放牛等六个作业组，工作地点分散，出工先后不一，因此，参加学习班人员不能落实，时间不好安排。针对这些问题，他们在广州部队某部四连毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，遵照毛主席“遇事多和群众商量”的教导，和贫下中农一起研究，最后决定把毛泽东思想学习班按工种办在田头。
    他们首先按工种把社员编成学习组，各组选出组长。队干部和学习毛主席著作辅导员搭配在各个组。学习内容由队委统一研究布置。各组可根据本组的思想情况和工作任务，灵活利用工间休息和业余时间，有的放矢地选学毛主席语录和毛主席最新指示。每次学习一个观点，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一句黑话，斗一次私心，解决一个现实问题。在学习班里，人人是学员，又是教员。谁学得好，就请谁当老师。他们这种学习自己抓，时间自己挤，理论联系实际，学用紧密结合的方法，收到了立竿见影的效果。
    办田头学习班有四个好处：
    一，人员落实。不论从事哪一项工作的社员，都能参加学习班学习。使牛、育秧的全劳力社员学在田头；放牛的半劳力社员学在路旁山边；做饭带小孩的老人在家组织学习。放牛组十三个社员，以往不能参加学习。按工种办学习班以后，他们成立了学习小组，组长梁任全经常组织大家一边放牛，一边学习。最近两期学习班，他们十三人一个不拉，每期都参加。
    二，组织落实。不论工种多繁杂，人员多分散，学习班始终冲不散。最近队里春耕工作多达八到十种，人员分散在方圆四五里地，集中起来需要三四十分钟。但是由于采用了按工种办学习班的方法，学习毛主席最新指示和斗私批修始终不间断，学习班同样办得生动活泼。个别社员工作变动，也可以从这个学习组到那个学习组继续学习。
    三，时间落实。按工种编成学习组，人数较少，便于集中，便于挤时间。学习时，每个人发言的机会也多。任务再繁重，学习时间仍然有保证。
    四，斗私批修效果好。按工种办学习班，由于学员经常在一起，活思想能够摸得准，发现及时，问题解决得快。青年女社员梁纯娇一向爱说爱笑，一天育秧时，突然变得沉默了。社员张木容了解到，是她前几天不请假上街，受了队长批评，心里憋了气。工间休息，张木容和她坐在一条田埂上，学习了毛主席“无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望”的教导，提高了她的认识。在学习班上，她惭愧地说：“我不请假上街，是头脑里‘私’字作怪，是受了无政府主义思潮的影响，是中了中国赫鲁晓夫‘个人利益一定要照顾’的毒。”从此以后，她样样工作服从分配，重担抢着挑，脏活抢着干。通过办这样的学习班，田间变成了活学活用毛主席最新指示的好课堂，斗私批修的好战场。抓革命促生产的好人好事不断涌现。
    现在，田心生产队出现了狠抓革命猛促生产的局面。田头到处都可以听到语录歌声，人人都争当斗私批修的先锋、大闹春耕生产的闯将。
