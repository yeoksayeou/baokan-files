Thousands of students in Rome have been holding demonstrations and marching in recent days, and have bravely fought against the fascist police who are suppressing them. The city of Rome has been paralyzed several times, and the ruling authorities are in a state of panic.

Italian students have repeatedly risen up against the corrupt and reactionary educational system in Italy. They have opposed the autocratic rule of the university presidents, demanded reforms in teaching content, increased educational funding, and improved the living conditions of poor students. However, the Italian authorities have consistently ignored these demands and brutally suppressed the student movements, which has led to a new wave of student struggles across the country.

The Italian authorities, frightened by the struggles of the students at the University of Rome, sent more than 1,500 police into the university on February 29 to brutally beat the students. This fascist violence enraged the students of Rome. That evening, 1,500 students held a protest demonstration. The following day, March 1, more than 4,000 students in Rome, carrying banners reading "Police out of the university!" "The president must resign!" and condemning the Italian government, held a demonstration. A large number of police, wearing helmets and wielding batons, attacked the demonstrators. The students picked up paving stones and tore down iron railings as weapons and bravely fought back against the police. They repelled the police's attack, seized a batch of police weapons, and burned and destroyed more than ten police cars.

The Italian authorities quickly sent another 2,000 police, using police cars to charge at the crowd, and used water cannons and tear gas to brutally suppress the students, injuring more than 300 students. Two hundred and twenty-eight students were unjustly arrested. During this period, traffic in Rome was disrupted, shops were closed, and the city was paralyzed.

On the 2nd and 3rd, several thousand students in Rome, despite the police's threats, continued to hold meetings and marches, protesting against the fascist violence of the Italian authorities. They expressed their determination not only to continue the struggle but also to promote and strengthen the national student movement.

The struggle of the students in Rome in recent days has pushed the student movements in other cities in Italy, such as Milan, Turin, Trieste, and Padua, to take action and fight against the reactionary authorities.

The just struggle of the Italian students has gained widespread support.

Many progressive students in Italy, while marching and demonstrating and fighting against the police, shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Revolution, revolution!" They were not afraid of the threats from the fully armed police and posted quotations from Chairman Mao on the streets.

Italian progressive students have great respect for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. Last week, when the Chinese film "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought" was shown at the University of Rome, every time Chairman Mao's great image appeared on the screen, they enthusiastically shouted, "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong!" and burst into thunderous applause.

    反对腐朽反动的教育制度　反对当局残暴镇压学生运动
    意大利大学生斗争浪潮席卷全国
    示威学生高呼“毛泽东万岁！”并在大街上张贴毛主席语录
    据新华社四日讯　罗马消息：意大利大学生反对意大利现行的腐朽反动的教育制度和反对政府当局残暴镇压学生运动的斗争浪潮最近席卷全国。数千名罗马学生，连日来举行示威游行，并同镇压他们的法西斯警察进行英勇搏斗，罗马市区一再陷于瘫痪，统治当局惶惶不安。
    意大利广大学生对于意大利现行的腐朽反动的教育制度一再起来反对。他们纷纷反对校长专制，要求改革教学内容，增加教育经费和改善贫苦学生的生活。但意大利当局一直置之不理，并且残酷镇压学生斗争，这就使得意大利全国各地的大学生最近掀起了斗争的新高潮。
    被罗马大学生的斗争吓得惊慌失措的意大利当局，二月二十九日出动了一千五百多名警察冲入罗马大学，残酷地殴打学生。这种法西斯暴行激起罗马学生的愤慨。当天晚上，一千五百名学生举行了抗议示威。接着，在三月一日，四千多名罗马学生高举着“警察滚出大学！”“校长必须辞职！”以及谴责意大利政府的标语牌举行了示威游行。头戴钢盔，挥舞警棍的大批警察袭击了示威群众。学生们挖起铺地的石头，拔起路旁的铁栏杆作为武器，英勇地对警察进行了反击。他们打退了警察的进攻，缴获了一批警察的枪支，焚烧和捣毁了十多辆警车。
    意大利当局连忙增派了约二千名警察，用警车对群众冲击，并使用了强力水龙和催泪弹对学生进行了野蛮的镇压，打伤了三百多名学生。二百二十八个学生被无理逮捕。在这期间，罗马市交通断绝，商店关门，市区陷于瘫痪状态。
    二日和三日，几千名罗马学生不顾警察的威胁，继续集会游行，抗议意大利当局的法西斯暴行。他们表示不仅要坚持斗争下去，而且要推动和加强全国性的学生斗争。
    罗马学生这几天的斗争推动了意大利其它各城市的学生运动，米兰、都灵、的里雅斯特、帕多瓦等城市的大学生都已纷纷行动起来，同反动当局进行斗争。
    意大利学生的正义斗争获得了广泛的支持。
    意大利的许多进步学生，在游行示威以及同警察搏斗时高呼“毛泽东万岁！”“革命，革命！”他们不怕全副武装的警察的威胁，在大街上张贴毛主席语录。
    意大利进步学生对全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席无限崇敬。上星期，中国影片《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利》在罗马大学放映时，每当毛主席的伟大形象在银幕上出现，他们就热情地高呼：“毛泽东，毛泽东！”并且爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。
