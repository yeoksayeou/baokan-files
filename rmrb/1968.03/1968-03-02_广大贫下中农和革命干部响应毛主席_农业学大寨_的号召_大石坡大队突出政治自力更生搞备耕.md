The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Dashipo Production Brigade of Taowu Commune, Changping County, Beijing, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, taking "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link, carrying out thorough revolutionary criticism and struggle, and thoroughly eliminating the poison of Liu Shaoqi's opposition to political leadership and self-reliance. People are presenting a new spiritual face, with a hundredfold revolutionary enthusiasm, and have launched a vigorous spring plowing campaign.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We advocate self-reliance. We hope to have foreign aid, but we cannot depend on it. We rely on our own efforts, on the creative power of the entire army and people." The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, based on Chairman Mao's teaching, analyzed the situation in Dashipo Brigade over the past more than ten years since liberation: The broad poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres in Dashipo have always followed Chairman Mao's lead and resolutely taken the socialist road. However, due to the infiltration of Liu Shaoqi's economicism poison, some people still have the incorrect idea of relying solely on state aid. This idea directly affects the smooth progress of the current spring plowing work. Therefore, the Propaganda Team decided to use the Mao Zedong Thought study class as a good platform to guide the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres' strong class feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the faithful implementation of the teaching of "learn from Dazhai in agriculture."

To help the broad poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres establish confidence in learning from and catching up with Dazhai, the study class carried out activities of two comparisons and one criticism. Two comparisons, that is, comparing the great changes in people's spiritual outlook before and after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; comparing the natural conditions of Dashipo Brigade and Dazhai Brigade. One criticism, that is, thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi and his agents' economicism poison spread in the old Beijing Municipal Committee and Changping County Committee within Dashipo. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, the more they compared, the more they felt that Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture" is the only correct direction for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants; the more they criticized, the more they felt that the economicism promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents is a poisonous snake that strangles the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm. This poisonous snake must be eradicated before Dashipo can truly emancipate itself.

The direction of learning from Dazhai has been determined, but there are still a few members who work solely for work points. This shows that Liu Shaoqi's poison of "material incentives" and "work points in command" has not been thoroughly eliminated from everyone's mind. Therefore, in the study class, this issue was discussed in terms of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, organizing members to repeatedly study the "Three Articles," and fiercely criticize the target of "work points in command" in their own minds. The comrades of the Propaganda Team also recalled bitterness and sweetness with everyone, jointly criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist fallacies of "work points in command" and "material incentives." Through these activities, the class consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants was greatly aroused. Old poor peasant Zhang Shixiu said: "Under the poison of Liu Shaoqi's 'work points in command' and 'material incentives,' I used to attach great importance to work points in the past. In fact, this is not just a simple matter of work points, but a big issue of whether to adhere to the socialist road and whether there is Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind. I only circled around work points and did not think about state affairs, forgetting Chairman Mao's teaching that politics is the commander and the soul. In the future, I will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, learn one and use one, with one heart for the collective, and with revolutionary enthusiasm, to make Chairman Mao happy."

Through setting up study classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Dashipo Brigade have further implemented Chairman Mao's teaching of "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," established the genuine thought of farming for revolution, and a wave of learning from Dazhai has flourished. Now, men, women, old, and young in the entire brigade have all thrown themselves into the enthusiastic spring plowing activities. This brigade of only sixty-three households has already opened up more than ten mu of Dazhai-style fields. To solve the problem of fertilizer, cadres and members are making high-temperature compost. Over fifty-year-old poor peasant Liu Yongshun, in addition to raising livestock for the brigade, also voluntarily collects manure for the brigade. He alone has collected more than fourteen thousand jin.

    广大贫下中农和革命干部响应毛主席“农业学大寨”的号召
    大石坡大队突出政治自力更生搞备耕
    本报讯　北京市昌平县桃洼公社大石坡大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，深入开展革命的大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反对政治挂帅、反对自力更生的流毒，人们以崭新的精神面貌，以百倍的革命热情，掀起了轰轰烈烈的备耕活动。
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”毛泽东思想宣传队根据毛主席这一教导，分析了大石坡大队解放十几年来的情况：大石坡的广大贫农、下中农和革命干部，一直是紧跟毛主席坚决地走社会主义道路的。但是由于受了中国赫鲁晓夫经济主义流毒的侵蚀，还有部分人有单纯依靠国家援助的不正确想法。他们这种想法，直接影响着当前备耕工作顺利开展。因此，宣传队决定利用毛泽东思想学习班这个大好课堂，把贫下中农和革命干部无限忠于毛主席革命路线的强烈阶级感情，引导到忠实执行“农业学大寨”的教导上来。
    为了帮助广大贫农、下中农和革命干部树立学、赶大寨的信心，学习班里开展了两对比、一批判的活动。两对比，就是把文化大革命以前和文化大革命以来的人的精神面貌的巨大变化进行对比；把大石坡大队和大寨大队的自然条件进行对比。一批判，就是彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人旧北京市委内和昌平县委内一小撮走资派在大石坡所散布的“经济主义”流毒。广大贫下中农和革命干部，越对比越觉得毛主席“农业学大寨”的号召，是广大贫下中农唯一正确的方向，越批判越觉得中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的经济主义是一条扼杀群众革命积极性的毒蛇，这条毒蛇不铲除，大石坡就不能彻底翻身。
    学大寨的方向肯定了，但也还有个别社员单纯为工分而干活。这说明了中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”的流毒还没有在每个人的头脑中彻底肃清。于是，在学习班里就这个问题进行斗私批修，组织社员反复学习“老三篇”，狠打自己头脑里“工分挂帅”的活靶子。宣传队的同志并和大家一起忆苦思甜，共同狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义谬论。通过这些活动，大大激发了广大贫下中农阶级觉悟。老贫农张士秀说：“在中国赫鲁晓夫‘工分挂帅’、‘物质刺激’的毒害下，过去我把工分看的很重，其实这不是一个简单的工分问题，而是坚持不坚持社会主义道路，头脑里有没有毛泽东思想的大问题。我只围着工分打圈子，没想到国家大事，忘记了毛主席政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导。以后我一定按毛主席教导办事，学一条用一条，一个心眼为集体，鼓起革命干劲，为毛主席他老人家争气。”
    大石坡大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，通过大办学习班，进一步落实了毛主席“农业学大寨”的教导，树立了真正为革命种田的思想，一个学大寨的热潮蓬勃发展起来。现在，全大队男女老少，都投入了热火朝天的备耕活动。这个仅仅六十三户的生产大队已开出大寨田十几亩。为了解决肥料问题，干部、社员大搞高温沤肥。五十多岁的贫农刘永顺，除给队里饲养牲口，还主动为队里拣粪，仅他一个人已拣了一万四千多斤。　晨　阳
