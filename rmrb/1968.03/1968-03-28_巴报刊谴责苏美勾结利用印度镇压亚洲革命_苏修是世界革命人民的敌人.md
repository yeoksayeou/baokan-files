Pakistani newspapers have condemned the Soviet-American collusion in using India to suppress the Asian revolution, labeling Soviet revisionists as enemies of the world's revolutionary people.

	NEW DELHI, March 26 (Xinhua) — The Lahore-based "Construction Daily" published articles on March 25 and 26 criticizing the massive military aid provided by the United States and the Soviet Union to the Indian reactionaries. The articles state that while the British Empire is unable to maintain its military presence east of the Suez Canal, the United States and the Soviet Union are hastening to use India militarily to counter the surging revolutionary tide in Asia.

	The articles point out that, as the United States is already bogged down in the people's war in Vietnam, it is forcing the Indian reactionaries to serve its political interests. The Soviet Union, like the United States, is hostile towards the People's Republic of China. Therefore, the United States and the Soviet Union are pursuing the same policy of using India as a tool against China.

	The articles note that due to India's acceptance of large-scale weapons aid from the Soviet Union and the United States, the threat of Indian military aggression against Pakistan is becoming increasingly severe.

	The articles state: "In this situation, the People's Republic of China is Pakistan's only sincere friend. China is Pakistan's friend, first and foremost, because the Chinese government regards Pakistan as a victim of Indian aggression, and secondly, because in Asia, only China pursues a clear policy of supporting anti-imperialist struggles."

	The articles say that the Vietnamese people have already achieved victory in their people's war against U.S. imperialism. The articles call on Pakistan to also use people's war to resist Indian aggression.

	NEW DELHI, March 26 (Xinhua) — The March issue of the monthly "Program" published in Karachi, West Pakistan, features an article stating that the Soviet revisionist leadership is an enemy of the revolutionary people worldwide.

	The article says that the Soviet rulers, in colluding with U.S. imperialism to pursue an anti-China policy, are not only hostile to China but also to the revolutionary ideology represented by China.

	The article says that despite the Soviet rulers' hypocritical talk about their supposed anti-imperialist stance on Vietnam and the Arab issue, the world knows that it is due to the betrayal by the Soviet revisionists that U.S. imperialism has been able to continue its armed aggression against Vietnam and that Arab countries have suffered temporary setbacks in the face of U.S.-Israeli aggression.

	The article condemns the Soviet revisionists' collusion with U.S. imperialism in playing the "peace talks" trick on the Vietnam issue.

	The article says that the Soviet rulers are providing large-scale weapons aid to the Indian reactionaries. India will not only use these weapons to invade Pakistan and suppress the freedom fighters in Kashmir but will also use them to massacre the revolutionaries in Naxalbari, India.

	The article says: "All these facts show that the Soviet rulers have not only abandoned the revolution but have become outright counter-revolutionaries. They are not friends but enemies of the people of Vietnam, the Middle East, Kashmir, Pakistan, and India."

	The article says that despite the Soviet rulers' various counter-revolutionary activities, the world revolutionary movement will not be extinguished but will ultimately achieve victory, while the hypocritical Soviet rulers will inevitably meet their doom.

    巴报刊谴责苏美勾结利用印度镇压亚洲革命
    苏修是世界革命人民的敌人
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二十六日电　巴基斯坦拉瓦尔品第《建设报》二十五日和二十六日就美帝和苏修给印度反动派以大批军事援助发表文章说，正当英帝国主义无法在苏伊士以东保持其军事力量的时候，美国和苏联加紧在军事上利用印度来对付亚洲日益高涨的革命浪潮。
    文章指出，由于美国自己已陷入越南人民战争的汪洋大海，它竭力驱使印度反动派为美国的政治利益效劳。苏联跟美国一样地敌视中华人民共和国。因此美国和苏联在奉行同样的政策，利用印度作为它们反对中国的工具。
    文章指出，由于印度接受苏美的大量武器援助，印度对巴基斯坦进行军事侵略的威胁变得愈来愈大了。
    文章说：“在这种情况下，人民中国是巴基斯坦唯一的真诚的朋友。中国所以是巴基斯坦的朋友，首先是因为中国政府认为，巴基斯坦是印度侵略野心的受害者，其次是因为在亚洲，只有中国奉行明确的支持反帝斗争的政策。”
    文章说，越南人民已经在抗击美帝的人民战争中取得了胜利。文章呼吁巴基斯坦也用人民战争来反抗印度的侵略。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第电　在西巴基斯坦卡拉奇出版的《纲领》月刊三月号刊登一篇文章说，苏修领导集团是全世界革命人民的敌人。
    文章说，苏联统治者勾结美帝国主义推行的反华政策，不仅是对中国的敌视，而且是对以中国为代表的革命思想的敌视。
    文章说，尽管苏联统治者假惺惺地谈论他们在越南和阿拉伯问题上的所谓反帝立场，但是全世界都知道，正是由于苏修的背叛，美帝国主义才得以继续对越南进行武装侵略，并使阿拉伯国家在美、以侵略中遭到了暂时的挫折。
    文章谴责了苏修伙同美帝在越南问题上玩弄“和谈”骗局。
    文章说，苏联统治者正向印度反动派提供大量的武器援助。印度将不仅使用这些武器来侵略巴基斯坦和镇压克什米尔的自由战士，而且还将用来屠杀纳萨尔巴里的印度革命者。
    文章说：“所有这些事实都表明，苏联统治者不仅已经抛弃了革命，而且已经变成赤裸裸的反革命。他们不是越南、中东、克什米尔、巴基斯坦和印度人民的朋友，而是敌人。”
  文章说，尽管苏联统治者干了这种种反革命活动，但是，世界革命运动不会被扑灭，相反将取得最后胜利，而伪善的苏联统治者则不可避免要走向灭亡。
