The leadership of the Beijing Military Region convened a meeting in Tianjin for military training units in North China to summarize and exchange experiences, focusing on intensifying class struggle and line struggle education, and fully implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive.

A New China News Agency report from Tianjin on March 14 stated: On the first anniversary of the issuance of Chairman Mao's famous directive on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and on the occasion of the re-publication of this great directive, the leadership of the People's Liberation Army Beijing Military Region held a meeting in Tianjin for military training units in North China to implement and carry out Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive. The meeting reviewed and summarized the implementation of the "March 7" directive over the past year, exchanged experiences, and studied measures for further implementation. The meeting called on all cadres and soldiers executing military training tasks in North China to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launch a campaign to study, propagate, implement, and carry out Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, and, guided by Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

During the seven-day meeting, representatives from military training units across North China, filled with profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, repeatedly reviewed Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive. Everyone agreed that this brilliant directive most profoundly, thoroughly, comprehensively, and to the highest degree summarized the fundamental purpose, fundamental tasks, fundamental methods, and fundamental attitudes of military and political training. It is a programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a powerful ideological weapon for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone resolved to implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives with the most enthusiastic political passion and revolutionary spirit, complete the glorious tasks assigned by Chairman Mao to the broad cadres and soldiers, and take Tianjin Yan'an Middle School as an example to turn the primary, secondary, and tertiary schools in North China into genuine red schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

With revolutionary enthusiasm, the representatives reviewed the brilliant journey of studying, propagating, executing, and defending Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive over the past year. Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, the primary, secondary, and tertiary schools in North China undergoing military training have undergone tremendous changes. Revolutionary teachers and students have an even deeper love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, they have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fought against selfishness and revisionism, suppressed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and consolidated and developed revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Currently, in the schools in North China undergoing military training, over 94% have achieved revolutionary unity, and over 82% have established revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination. Revolutionary teachers and students have responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, insisted on resuming classes and making revolution, and the great mass movement of the proletarian educational revolution, guided by Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts, is developing in depth.

The meeting emphasized that fully implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives must highlight the proletarian "loyalty." It must be absolutely loyal to the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, absolutely loyal to the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, and absolutely loyal to the Central Cultural Revolution Group. It must be fully recognized that the process of implementing the "March 7" directive is a sharp and complex class struggle. The attitude towards Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives must be elevated to the level of two classes, two roads, and two lines struggle. Only by highlighting the proletarian "loyalty" can one firmly believe in and unshakably implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives. Only by highlighting the proletarian "loyalty" can one expose the various conspiracies of the class enemy to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, eliminate various interferences, and bravely defend Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives in the stormy waves of class struggle, ensuring that every directive is implemented and fully implemented. The meeting pointed out that in the process of implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives, it is necessary to intensify the ideological transformation of military training personnel. The more the ideological transformation of military training personnel is intensified, the closer one follows Chairman Mao, the more loyal one is to Chairman Mao, and the better the military and political training is conducted. Military training personnel must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "to be a good teacher, one must first be a good student," humbly and sincerely learn from revolutionary youngsters, revolutionary teachers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary workers, and ignite a revolution in their souls while transforming the objective world.

The meeting believed that implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives must focus on the fundamentals, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the school, and arm the broad revolutionary teachers and students with Mao Zedong Thought. This is the essence of politics, the essence of the soul, and the core of the core. Due to the influence of several thousand years of private ownership and the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line and revisionist educational line, the struggle between bourgeois and proletarian ideologies among revolutionary teachers and students has been very intense. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist trends are corrosive to the revolutionary ranks, seriously interfering with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and affecting the implementation of Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives. Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is necessary to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks to the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Military training cadres and soldiers must follow this great teaching of Chairman Mao, help revolutionary teachers and students learn, apply, and use Mao Zedong Thought, highlight the "loyalty" to Chairman Mao, intensify the "use" of Mao Zedong Thought, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, and organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in schools, grades, classes, outside schools, and families. Do a good job in ideological and political work, and guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in the revolutionary ranks to the track of Mao Zedong Thought. Military training cadres and soldiers should lead by example, spreading and applying the political work system of the People's Liberation Army, such as insisting on the Four Firsts, promoting the Three-Eight Style, cultivating the Four Good Teams and Five Good Soldiers, and carrying out "one helps one, one pairs with one," as well as daily reading of Chairman Mao's works and speaking meetings, to the school work, implementing political leadership of the school, and letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions inside and outside the school. Intensify class struggle education and line struggle education, help revolutionary teachers and students learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Invite workers, peasants, and soldiers to give class education, carry out mass "recall and compare" activities, and carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation, thoroughly criticizing the crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev in pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and conspiring to restore capitalism.

The meeting believed that implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, insist on resuming classes and making revolution, and do a good job in the proletarian educational revolution. "All primary, secondary, and tertiary schools must resume classes and make revolution," this is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Only by insisting on resuming classes and making revolution and doing a good job in the proletarian educational revolution can the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools be thoroughly changed. In the process of resuming classes and making revolution, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," and old forces will inevitably use the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies in our ranks to resist and sabotage. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to eliminating various interferences, continuously consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and continuously enhancing the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, insisting on the correct direction of resuming classes and making revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the school, and rely on the active elements among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end." Military training cadres and soldiers must follow this great teaching of Chairman Mao, believe in the masses, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and organize a surging proletarian educational revolutionary army. Deeply study Chairman Mao's brilliant expositions on educational revolution, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, thoroughly reform the old educational system, and reform the old teaching principles and methods. Organize the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers, with Chairman Mao's brilliant educational revolutionary thoughts as the guide, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, implement the combination of teaching reform groups and broad revolutionary teachers and students; the combination of local teachers and students and the broad workers, peasants, and soldiers; the combination of teaching reform and teaching practice, teaching while practicing, and reforming while practicing.

The meeting emphasized that fully implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives must help the school build a revolutionary leadership cadre. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." Vice Chairman Lin instructs: "Our leadership cadre should be composed of people who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever walk the revolutionary path of Chairman Mao." Military training units should help establish revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination, and more importantly, help the revolutionary committees do a good job in ideological and organizational transformation. Only when the revolutionary committee is armed with Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, will it have a soul, have a direction, and truly become an authoritative power organ of the proletariat, truly become the strong command post leading the broad revolutionary teachers and students to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school, complete the great historical task of transforming the school with Mao Zedong Thought, implementing Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts, and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Military training units should actively support and fully respect the revolutionary committee. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, all work in the school, including the cultural revolution, should be led by the revolutionary committee, and the military training units should not take over. Military training personnel should actively lead in implementing the resolutions of the revolutionary committee and set an example. Make revolutionary cadres and young revolutionaries able to be tempered in leadership positions, establish proletarian authority in actual struggles, and play a leading role. Principles must be insisted upon, and vigilance must be heightened to prevent class enemies from sabotaging the new revolutionary committee. Military training units should be the strong backbone of the revolutionary committee.

The meeting emphasized that the re-publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant "March 7" directive makes us further understand that the tasks of military training units in the future are even more glorious and arduous. We must further raise our understanding of Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, be good at using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the situation, strengthen the ideological transformation of military training personnel, prevent complacency and relaxation, be vigilant against the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, redouble our efforts, strive to be the best, and continue to fully implement Chairman Mao's brilliant "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives, and in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, create new achievements for the people.

Responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army Beijing Military Region and responsible comrades of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee attended the meeting. Representatives from relevant departments of the revolutionary committees of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in North China also attended the meeting.

　　北京部队领导机关召开华北军训部队会议总结交流经验
　　狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争教育
　　全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示
    新华社天津十四日电　在我们伟大导师毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署的著名的“三·七”指示发出一周年和这一伟大指示重新发表的时候，人民解放军北京部队领导机关在天津召开了华北地区军训部队贯彻落实毛主席“三·七”指示会议，检查总结了一年来贯彻执行“三·七”指示的情况，交流了经验，研究了今后进一步贯彻落实“三·七”指示的措施。会议号召在华北地区执行军训任务的全体指战员紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起一个大学习、大宣传、大贯彻、大落实毛主席“三·七”指示的热潮，沿着毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示指引的光辉道路，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    在历时七天的会议上，来自华北各地的军训部队代表，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，一遍又一遍地重温了毛主席的“三·七”指示。大家一致认为，这一光辉的指示，最精辟、最透彻、最全面、最高度地概括了军政训练的根本目的、根本任务、根本方法和根本态度，是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的强大思想武器。大家决心以最饱满的政治热情和革命干劲，进一步全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，胜利完成毛主席交给广大指战员的光荣任务，以天津延安中学为榜样，把华北地区大、中、小学真正办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    代表们满怀革命豪情，回顾了一年来学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛主席“三·七”指示的光辉历程。在伟大领袖毛主席“三·七”指示的光辉照耀下，华北地区实行军训的大、中、小学，发生了巨大的变化，广大革命师生对毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线更加热爱、更加忠诚。他们在人民解放军的帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，斗私批修，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，增强无产阶级党性，巩固、发展了革命大联合和革命三结合。目前，在华北地区实行军训的学校中，已有百分之九十四以上实现了革命大联合，百分之八十二以上建立了三结合的革命委员会。广大革命师生响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，坚持复课闹革命，以毛主席教育革命思想为指针的无产阶级教育革命的伟大群众运动正在向纵深发展。
    会议强调指出，全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，必须突出无产阶级的“忠”字，无限忠于无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席，无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无限忠于毛主席的最亲密战友林副主席，无限忠于毛主席为首的党中央，无限忠于中央文革。要充分认识到，落实“三·七”指示的过程，是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争过程。必须把对待毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的态度问题提到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度来认识。只有突出无产阶级的“忠”字，才会对毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示坚信不疑，坚定不移，坚决执行。只有突出无产阶级的“忠”字，才会识破阶级敌人破坏毛主席伟大战略部署的各种阴谋，排除各种干扰，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中勇敢地捍卫毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，使毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示条条落实，全面落实。会议指出，在落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的过程中，必须狠抓军训人员的思想革命化。军训人员的思想革命化抓得越狠，跟毛主席就越紧，对毛主席就越忠，军政训练也就搞得越好。军训人员必须遵照毛主席关于“要作好先生，首先要作好学生”的教导，虚心诚恳地向革命小将、革命教师、革命干部、革命工人学习，在灵魂深处爆发革命，在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界。
    会议认为，贯彻落实毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，必须狠抓根本，用毛泽东思想统帅学校，用毛泽东思想武装广大革命师生的头脑，搞好人的思想革命化。这是政治中的政治，灵魂中的灵魂，核心中的核心。由于几千年私有制的影响，由于资产阶级反动路线和修正主义教育路线的流毒，革命师生中资产阶级和无产阶级两种思想的斗争一直是很剧烈的。资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮，是革命队伍的腐蚀剂，严重干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，影响毛主席“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的贯彻落实。毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”执行军训任务的指战员必须遵照毛主席这一伟大教导，帮助革命师生活学活用毛泽东思想，对毛主席突出一个“忠”字，对毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，学校办，年级办，班里办，校外办，家庭办，做好思想政治工作，把革命队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到毛泽东思想的轨道。执行军训任务的指战员要言传身教，把人民解放军坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，培养四好连队、五好战士，开展“一帮一、一对红”，以及天天读毛主席著作、开讲用会等一系列行之有效的政治工作制度，传播和运用到学校工作中去，实行政治建校，让毛泽东思想占领校内外一切阵地。要狠抓阶级斗争教育和路线斗争教育，帮助革命师生在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想。请工农兵上阶级教育课，开展群众性“忆比”活动，开展革命大批判，彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派推行反革命修正主义路线，阴谋复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。
    会议认为，落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持复课闹革命，搞好无产阶级教育革命。“大中小学校都要复课闹革命”，这是毛主席的伟大战略部署。只有坚持复课闹革命，搞好无产阶级教育革命，才能彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象。在复课闹革命的过程中，党内一小撮走资派、资产阶级反动学术“权威”和旧的习惯势力，必然会利用我们队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，进行抵制和破坏。因此，必须注意排除各种干扰，不断巩固、发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，不断增强广大革命师生的革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，坚持复课闹革命的大方向。
    毛主席教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”执行军训任务的指战员要遵照毛主席这一伟大教导，相信群众，发动群众，依靠群众，组织浩浩荡荡的无产阶级教育革命大军，深入学习毛主席关于教育革命的光辉论述，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义教育路线，彻底改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教学方针和方法。要把广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人组织起来，以毛主席光辉的教育革命思想为统帅，在革命委员会的领导下，实行教改小组和广大革命师生相结合；本校师生和广大工农兵相结合；教学改革和教学实践相结合，边教学，边实践，边改革。
    会议着重指出，全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，一定要帮助学校建设一个革命化的领导班子。毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”林副主席指示：“我们的领导班子，应该是永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远走毛主席革命道路的人组成。”军训部队要帮助建立三结合的革命委员会，更重要的是要帮助革命委员会搞好思想革命化和组织革命化。革命委员会只有用毛泽东思想武装起来，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才有灵魂，才有方向，才能真正成为有无产阶级权威的权力机构，才能真正成为领导广大革命师生搞好学校斗、批、改的坚强指挥部，完成用毛泽东思想改造学校，落实毛主席教育革命思想，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大历史任务。军训部队要积极支持、充分尊重革命委员会。革命委员会成立以后，学校的文化大革命和其他一切工作，统由革命委员会领导，军训部队不要包办代替。军训人员对革命委员会的决议，要积极带头贯彻执行，做好样子。使革命干部、革命小将能够在领导岗位上经受锻炼，在实际斗争中树立无产阶级权威，发挥领导作用。要坚持原则，提高警惕，防止阶级敌人破坏新生的革命委员会。军训部队要做革命委员会的坚强后盾。
    会议强调指出，毛主席光辉的“三·七”指示的重新发表，使我们进一步理解到，今后军训部队的任务更加光荣，更加艰巨，必须进一步提高对毛主席“三·七”指示的认识，善于用毛泽东思想分析形势，加强军训人员的思想革命化，防止自满松劲情绪，警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，全面落实毛主席光辉的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，为人民立新功。
    人民解放军北京部队负责人、天津市革命委员会负责人出席了会议。出席会议的还有华北地区各省、市、自治区革命委员会有关部门的代表。
