The Revolutionary Committee of Pinggu County, Beijing, conducted class education for grassroots cadres and the masses by organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The education focused on "three remembrances, three comparisons, and one summary." The "three remembrances, three comparisons, and one summary" are as follows:

1. Remember the bitterness of the old society and compare it with the sweetness of the new society;
2. Remember the bitterness of the capitalist reactionary line and compare it with the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line;
3. Remember the cultivation by Chairman Mao and the Party, and compare it with one's own contributions to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

On this basis, summarize how to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

	Remember the bitterness of the old society,
	Compare it with the sweetness of the new society

Most grassroots cadres are from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, each with a history of blood and tears. Some young cadres, who grew up in the new society, have not experienced the hardships of the old society. Through remembering the bitterness, class education can further raise their class consciousness. The Party Secretary of the Hanzhuang Commune's Shuiwu Brigade, during the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, was struck by the storm and became confused, not wanting to be a cadre anymore. He said, "It was like being in a field of fallen high corn, I couldn't find my way." After remembering the bitterness of the old society, he recalled the past: no food, holding an empty gourd all day, begging for food outside. He also thought of Chairman Mao leading the people in revolution, and he himself was liberated. He couldn't sleep for two nights. He said, "The red sun shines in my heart, the path is clear. Remembering the bitterness suffered in the old society, no matter what, I must do the revolution."

	In addition to remembering the bitterness personally, some deeply aggrieved poor peasants were invited to share their stories to set the tone and stir up memories of bitterness. The Wangxin Commune organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class, gathering brigade and production team cadres to study, and invited someone who had suffered deeply in the old society to share their experiences. Some cadres had forgotten their past hardships, but now they were reminded, recalling the scenes of landlords and capitalists "grinding their teeth at three in the morning and eating people at five in the morning," they hated the old society even more and loved the new society even more. Some young men and women, after listening, said indignantly, "There were such things! The old society must not return, we must revolutionize to the end!"

	To make the bitterness and sweetness education more profound, many Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Pinggu County adopted the method of "eating bitterness meals." The Wangxin Commune's study class, one day, prepared thirty pounds of bran, five pounds of sweet potato leaves, and a small amount of cornmeal, making over sixty bran cakes, one for each person. Everyone ate while remembering the bitterness. An old man seeing the bran cakes said, "I used to eat this when I herded sheep for the landlord. At that time, two shoulders carried one mouth, suffering endless bitterness." He ate two, and didn't eat the evening meal made of white flour. Everyone thought of the past bitter days and expressed, "We must not let the Chinese Khrushchev restore capitalism, the days of the old society must not return!"

	Remembering the bitterness is also combined with the education of the "four histories": family history, village history, the history of struggle after liberation, and the history of liberation. The deeper the bitterness is remembered, the sweeter the new society feels. When talking about the liberation history of the new society, everyone had more to say. In the Donggao Village Commune study class, everyone compared Zhao Village. In the past, out of 110 households, only three landlords and rich peasants lived in tiled houses; today, the entire village has tiled houses. Only one family has three earthen rooms, which are used as a shed for firewood.

	Remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing it with the sweetness of the new society is not just about trivial details, but about guiding everyone to trace the roots. The bitterness of the old society lies in the oppression of the three big mountains. The sweetness of the new society lies in the leadership of Chairman Mao in building socialism. This elevates everyone's sensory memories and comparisons to a rational understanding.

	Remember the bitterness of the capitalist reactionary line,
	Compare it with the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line

During the Cultural Revolution, some cadres often could not correctly handle the impact of the mass movement, always feeling wronged. They need to be guided to express their grievances, focusing on the Chinese Khrushchev; they need to be guided to correctly handle the masses, recognizing their own shortcomings and errors, and accepting criticism from the masses, even if it is a bit excessive. A cadre who transferred from the army, during the Cultural Revolution, was criticized by the masses and was very unhappy. Later, in the study class, he remembered the bitterness of the capitalist reactionary line, realizing that the Chinese Khrushchev is the root of the trouble, and he couldn't help but cry. He immediately went back and made a self-criticism to the masses.

	Remembering the bitterness must not be for the sake of remembering the bitterness, but must be targeted at current thoughts and solve ideological problems. While remembering the bitterness, discussions must be held. "The revolutionary spirit of the masses is strong, it's hard to lead them." This is a thought that arose during the remembrance of the bitterness of the capitalist reactionary line. A deputy secretary of the Xiong'erzhuang Commune originally felt that the masses were hard to lead. Through study and discussion, his consciousness was raised. He said, "To lead the masses well, I must first learn Mao Zedong Thought well. If it doesn't conform to Mao Zedong Thought, the masses will rebel against me; if it conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, the masses will definitely support me."

	Recalling and comparing are conducted alternately. Comparing the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is to conduct line education for everyone. Two lines, two methods. Everyone, through study, deeply felt that the capitalist reactionary line strikes down a large number and protects a few, while Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line believes in and relies on the majority of the masses and cadres. Many people said emotionally, "We must spend our lives red on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

	Remember the cultivation by Chairman Mao and the Party,
	Compare it with one's own contributions to the revolutionary cause

The vast majority of grassroots cadres in rural areas are cultivated by the Party. Everyone, upon recalling, felt a surge of class sentiment towards Chairman Mao and the Party.

	"Why did Chairman Mao and the Party cultivate us?" In the recall, everyone discussed this question. Initially, everyone had different opinions, but in the end, it became clear: Chairman Mao and the Party cultivated us to seize power for the proletariat, to seize power for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Only by seizing this power can we ensure that our country does not change color. Zhou Caifang, a young Party branch secretary from Shandongzhuang Commune's Qiaotou Camp, was trained during the Four Cleanups and struggled during the Cultural Revolution. She said, "I once thought, it would be better to be a community member, why bother being a cadre and getting struggled? Later, I thought, if I don't stand up and seize power, and let the unclean cadres seize power again, isn't that letting Qiaotou Camp change color?"

	Chairman Mao said, "We Communist Party members should face the wind and rain, see the world." In the study class, the cadres, through study, all realized this. The cultivation by Chairman Mao and the Party is not to cultivate in a warm nest, such people have no combat effectiveness. Only through struggle can one become a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The Cultural Revolution is like a fierce fire, burning away one's shortcomings and errors, what's bad about that?

	Comparing one's own contributions to the people, everyone felt it was not enough. A cadre who had won battles said, "In the past, I said, take off your clothes and see who has bullet holes, who is a revolutionary rebel. After learning Chairman Mao's instruction, 'Don't eat old capital, create new achievements,' I felt I was wrong. What contributions have I made to the people? I must create new achievements."

	Summarize how to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought

The "three remembrances and three comparisons" helped cadres stand firm in their class stance, making everyone's minds clear and their spirits high. Ultimately, the "three remembrances and three comparisons" are to raise awareness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

	Some people, during the Cultural Revolution, because they did not learn Mao Zedong Thought well, took many detours. After study, they summarized: "The Yellow River took a hundred bends, but still flows east. I will actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution."

    阶级教育的课堂
    ——平谷县毛泽东思想学习班调查报告
    北京市平谷县革命委员会在大办毛泽东思想学习班中，对基层干部和广大群众进行了“三忆、三比、一总结”的阶级教育。“三忆、三比、一总结”是：
      忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；
      忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜；
      忆毛主席和党的培养，比自己对无产阶级革命事业的贡献；
      在三忆、三比的基础上，总结自己如何活学活用毛泽东思想。
          忆旧社会的苦，
    比新社会的甜
    广大基层干部，绝大多数是贫下中农，人人有一部血泪史。有些青年干部，在新社会长大，没有受过旧社会的苦。通过忆苦，对他们进行阶级教育，就可以进一步提高他们的阶级觉悟。韩庄公社洙水大队党支部书记，在文化大革命的大风大浪中受到冲击，一时思想混乱，不想再当干部。他说：“仿佛到了给大风吹倒的乱高粱地里，怎么走，我都摸不清。”经过忆旧社会苦，他想起了过去：没有吃的，成天抱着个干水瓢，出外讨饭……。他又想起了毛主席领导人民闹革命，自己得到了解放。他一连两个晚上睡不着觉。他说：“红太阳照到我心里，路清楚了。想起了在旧社会受的苦，说什么我也得干革命。”
    除了自己忆苦以外，还请一些苦大仇深的贫下中农来给大家忆苦，做个引子，以苦引苦。王辛庄公社开办毛泽东思想学习班，集中大队、生产队干部学习，请了一个在旧社会受苦很深的人来给大家忆苦。有些干部把自己过去的苦本来都忘了，这时也给引了起来，想起地主资本家“三更天磨牙，五更天吃人”的情景，更加仇恨旧社会，更加热爱新社会。有些青年姑娘、小伙子听了，都愤慨地说：“还有这等事！绝不能让旧社会重来，我们干革命一定干到底！”
    为了把忆苦思甜教育进行得更深刻，平谷县许多毛泽东思想学习班，采取了“吃苦餐”的办法。王辛庄公社的学习班，有一天，找了三十斤小米糠，五斤白薯叶，外加少许玉米面，做了六十多个糠窝窝，平均一人一个。大家一边吃，一边忆苦。一个老人见了糠窝窝，连声说：“我以前给地主放羊就吃这个。那时两个肩膀扛着一张嘴，苦受尽了。”他一连吃了两个，白面做的晚饭也不吃了。大家想起了过去的苦日子，纷纷表示：“可不能让中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义，旧社会的日子绝不能再来！”
    忆苦还结合四史教育。四史就是家史、村史、解放后的斗争史、翻身史。苦忆得越深，越感到新社会甜。谈到新社会的翻身史，大家的话就更多了。东高村公社学习班里，大家拿赵庄户作了一个对比。赵庄户一百一十户人家，过去，只有三户地主富农住瓦房；今天呢，全村都是瓦房了。只有一家有三间土房，还是当柴禾棚子用的。
    忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，不是尽扯眉毛眼角的琐事，要引导大家追根。旧社会的苦，苦在三座大山压头。新社会的甜，甜在毛主席领导的社会主义好。把大家从感性的回忆对比，提到理性认识的高度。
            忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，
      比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜
    在无产阶级文化大革命当中，有些干部往往不能正确对待群众运动的冲击，总觉得自己受了委屈。要引导他们诉苦，把目标集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上；要引导他们正确对待群众，认识到自己有缺点错误，受到群众的批判是应当的，过火一点也不要紧。有一个从部队转业的干部，在无产阶级文化大革命当中，受到群众批判，很不服气。后来他在学习班里忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，认识到中国赫鲁晓夫是祸根，不禁哭了。他回去立即向群众作了检查。
    不能为忆苦而忆苦，必须针对活思想，解决思想问题。一面忆苦，要一面讨论。“群众革命造反精神强，不好领导了。”这是大家在忆资产阶级反动路线的苦中产生的活思想。熊耳寨公社一个支部副书记，原来觉得群众不好领导了。学习当中，大家议论以后，他认识提高了。他说：“要领好群众，我得先学好毛泽东思想。不符合毛泽东思想，群众就会造我的反；符合毛泽东思想，群众一定会支持。”
    回忆和对比交错进行。比毛主席革命路线的甜，就是要向大家进行路线教育。两条路线，两种做法。大家经过学习，深深体会到，资产阶级反动路线打击一大片，保护一小撮，而毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是相信和依靠群众和干部的大多数。许多人感动地说：“我们要一辈子红在毛主席的革命路线上。”
      忆毛主席和党的培养，
  比自己对革命事业的贡献
  农村广大基层干部，都是党培养起来的。大家回忆起来，对毛主席和党的阶级感情都油然而生。
    “毛主席和党为什么培养我们？”在回忆中大家讨论了这个问题。开始，大家说法不一，说到最后，就成了一条理：毛主席和党培养我们，就是要我们为无产阶级掌权，为贫下中农掌权。只有掌好这个权，才能保证我们国家不变颜色。山东庄公社桥头营周彩花，是在四清中培养出来的年青的党支部书记。她在文化大革命中，受到四不清下台干部的斗争。她说：“我也曾想过，当个社员多好呀，何必当干部挨斗？后来想到我要不挺起腰杆来掌权，再让四不清干部掌权，不正是叫桥头营变颜色？”
    毛主席说：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面”。在学习班中，广大干部经过学习，都认识到这一点。毛主席和党对自己的培养，并不是放到暖洞子里去培养，那样的人是没有战斗力的。只有到斗争中去锻炼，才能成为无产阶级革命事业接班人。无产阶级文化大革命，好比一场烈火，把自己的缺点错误烧掉了，那有什么不好？
    比到自己对人民的贡献，大家都感到很不够。在战场上立过功的干部说：“过去我说，脱下衣服来，看看谁身上有枪眼，谁才是革命造反派。学了毛主席
  ‘不要吃老本，要立新功’的指示，我感到错了。我对人民有多少贡献？一定要立新功。”
        总结如何活学活用毛泽东思想
    三忆三比，帮助干部站稳了阶级立场，使人人头脑清醒，干劲倍增。三忆三比，归根结底，是为了提高对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的觉悟，无限忠于毛主席。
    有的人在文化大革命中，因为没有学好毛泽东思想，走了许多弯路，经过学习，总结了一条：“黄河绕了一百个弯子，还要向东。我要活学活用毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席干革命。”
