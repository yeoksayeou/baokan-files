The imperialist tool of the United States, Israel, after brazenly declaring the Arab territories it had seized as "military occupied zones," launched a sudden large-scale military invasion of Jordan on March 21. The Jordanian army and the Palestinian anti-imperialist armed forces resolutely resisted Israel's new invasion. The Israeli invading forces suffered heavy losses and were finally forced to withdraw to the west bank of the Jordan River.

The Israeli invaders have recently been repeatedly provoking Arab countries with military actions, fully exposing the expansionist ambitions of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to permanently occupy Arab territories. Although the U.S.-Israeli invaders' armed invasion of Jordan was repelled, they will not give up. Israeli Defense Minister Dayan recently brazenly boasted that he would engage in a "long-term battle" with the Palestinian armed forces, arrogantly stating that he would not "give up" the positions he had gained in the invasion. This means that the Israeli invaders are attempting to use force to further coerce Arab countries into submission and extinguish the flames of the Palestinian people's anti-imperialist armed struggle.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is the real steel wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who truly and sincerely support the revolution. This is the real steel wall, which no force can break, absolutely no force can break."

The Palestinian armed forces are a new force. In this battle to counter the Israeli invasion, this force played an active role. They did not rely on superior weapons and equipment, but on the masses who sincerely took up arms to fight bravely. As long as the Palestinian people and the Arab people remain steadfast and unyielding, and persist in armed struggle, they will surely defeat the Israeli invaders supported by U.S. imperialism.

Regarding the anti-invasion struggle of the Arab people, especially the Palestinian people, the Soviet revisionist leadership has always played a counter-revolutionary two-faced game of false support and real betrayal. After the United States supported its lackey Israel in launching a new invasion of Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist leadership hastily issued a statement, hypocritically declaring its willingness to "participate in the implementation" of sanctions against Israel, while at the same time advocating for a "political solution" to the Near East problem through the United Nations. In essence, this is to pressure the Arab people to stop their anti-invasion armed struggle, once again betraying the interests of the Arab people, and serving the imperialist and war policies of the United States.

The aggressive actions of Israel have aroused the indignation of the Arab countries and people. Arab public opinion strongly condemns the U.S.-Israeli aggression. The people of Iraq held demonstrations. The armed forces of Syria are on alert. The United Arab Republic, Iraq, Yemen, Algeria, South Yemen, and other Arab countries have issued statements supporting the heroic struggle of Jordan and the Palestinian people. The struggle of the Arab people is not isolated. It is an inseparable part of the entire anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely support the just struggle of the Palestinian people and the Arab people against U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel. The Chinese people believe that the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel will ultimately be thoroughly smashed by the Arab people. The final victory will surely belong to the Palestinian people and the Arab people, who have a tradition of anti-imperialist struggle!

    胜利一定属于阿拉伯人民
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列，在把强占的阿拉伯国家领土悍然宣布为“军事占领区”以后，又于三月二十一日突然发动对约旦的大规模军事侵略。约旦军队和巴勒斯坦人民反帝武装力量对以色列的新的侵略行动进行了坚决抵抗。以色列侵略军损失惨重，终于被迫撤回约旦河西岸地区。
    以色列侵略者最近接二连三地对阿拉伯国家进行军事挑衅，充分暴露了美帝国主义及其走卒企图长期霸占阿拉伯领土的扩张野心。美、以侵略者这次武装侵略约旦虽被击退，但它们是绝不会死心的。以色列国防部长达扬最近公然叫嚣要同巴勒斯坦人民武装力量进行一场“长期的战役”，野心勃勃地表示“不愿意放弃”它在侵略战争中“所取得的阵地”。这就是说，以色列侵略者妄图用武力进一步胁迫阿拉伯国家屈服，扑灭巴勒斯坦人民反帝武装斗争的火焰。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席教导说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。”
    巴勒斯坦人民武装力量是一支新生的力量。在这次反击以色列侵略战斗中，这支力量发挥了积极的作用。他们依靠的并不是什么优势的武器装备，而是真心实意地拿起武器进行英勇战斗的群众。巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民只要坚强不屈，坚持武装斗争，就一定能打败美帝国主义支持的以色列侵略者。
    对于阿拉伯人民、特别是巴勒斯坦人民的反侵略斗争，苏修领导集团一直是玩弄着假支持、真出卖的反革命两面派手法。在这次美国支持其走狗以色列发动对阿拉伯国家新的侵略后，苏修领导集团匆匆忙忙抛出一个声明，一面假惺惺地宣称它愿意“参加执行”对以色列“采取制裁”，一面又鼓吹通过联合国“政治解决”近东问题。说穿了，就是要压迫阿拉伯人民停止反侵略的武装斗争，再一次出卖阿拉伯人民利益，为美帝的侵略政策和战争政策效劳。
    以色列的侵略行径，激起了阿拉伯国家和人民的同仇敌忾。阿拉伯各国舆论强烈谴责美、以侵略。伊拉克人民举行示威游行。叙利亚的武装部队已处于戒备状态。阿联、伊拉克、也门、阿尔及利亚、南也门等阿拉伯国家纷纷发表声明，支援约旦和巴勒斯坦人民的英勇斗争。阿拉伯人民的斗争决不是孤立的。它是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民整个反帝革命事业的不可分割的一部分。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民，坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民反抗美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的正义斗争。中国人民相信，美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的侵略，终将被阿拉伯人民彻底粉碎。最后胜利一定属于富有反帝斗争传统的巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民！
