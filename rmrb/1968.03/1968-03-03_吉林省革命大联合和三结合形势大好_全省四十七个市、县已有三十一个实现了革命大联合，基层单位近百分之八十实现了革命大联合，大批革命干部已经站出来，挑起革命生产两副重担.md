In the midst of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the tide of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination in Jilin Province is surging forward. The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire province is excellent and getting better.

Revolutionary scenes are everywhere in the cities and countryside of Jilin. Since the Spring Festival, the number of cities, counties, and grassroots units that have achieved revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination has been increasing. Currently, out of the 47 cities and counties in the province, 31 have achieved revolutionary unity. Nearly 80% of the grassroots units have achieved revolutionary unity. With the realization of revolutionary unity, the three-in-one combination is also rapidly developing. Some regions, counties, and a large number of grassroots units have already established temporary power organs for the three-in-one combination.

Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses in Jilin Province have made studying and applying Chairman Mao's works their first need in life. The movement to study Chairman Mao's works has never been as widespread and in-depth as it is now; implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions has never been as conscious as it is today. After Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction to establish many study classes, the masses across the province responded enthusiastically. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, covering the cities and countryside. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 100,000 study classes of various types have been established across the province, with over 3 million people participating in the study.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the broad revolutionary masses and the Red Guards have carried out a profound revolution in their souls, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to attack the "self" and declare war on factionalism. They have exposed the crimes of factionalism, denounced the harm of factionalism, dug out the roots of factionalism, and launched a "people's war" to suppress factionalism.

Many units' revolutionary masses in the study classes have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, reviewed and summarized through self-examination, and recalled comparisons, finding four similarities among the revolutionary masses of various factions: first, love is the same, all have unlimited love for Chairman Mao and unlimited love for Mao Zedong Thought; second, hate is the same, all hate the old society, hate the Chinese Khrushchev, and hate imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries; third, the path is the same, all follow the socialist broad road indicated by Chairman Mao; fourth, the revolutionary goal is the same, all aim to achieve a comprehensive victory in the cultural revolution and ensure that the iron-clad dictatorship of the proletariat in our country remains unshakable for thousands of years. They said, these four similarities are our fundamental interests. We have no reason to split into this faction or that faction. We should be one faction, the revolutionary faction armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Before the Spring Festival, only about 40% of the grassroots units in the province had achieved revolutionary unity. After the Spring Festival, this number increased by nearly onefold, reaching nearly 80%.

Chairman Mao teaches: "Correctly handling the relationship with cadres is a key issue in implementing the three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. It must be solved well." Many Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various places have absorbed cadres to participate or specially organized revolutionary factions to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue, effectively solving the cadre issue. Currently, a large number of revolutionary cadres have stood out in the province, municipalities, counties, and many grassroots units.

The broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" in Jilin Province have conscientiously implemented the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, patiently done a large amount of ideological and political work, helped revolutionary masses and Red Guards overcome factionalism, and strengthened party spirit, making outstanding contributions to promoting revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

    吉林省革命大联合和三结合形势大好
    全省四十七个市、县已有三十一个实现了革命大联合，基层单位近百分之八十实现了革命大联合，大批革命干部已经站出来，挑起革命生产两副重担
    据新华社长春一日电　在全面落实毛主席最新指示的热潮中，吉林省革命大联合和革命三结合的洪流滚滚向前，全省无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，越来越好。
    吉林城乡到处充满了热气腾腾的革命景象。春节以来，实现革命大联合和革命三结合的市、县和基层单位，越来越多。目前，全省四十七个市、县中已经有三十一个实现了革命大联合。实现革命大联合的基层单位已近百分之八十。随着革命大联合的实现，革命三结合也正在迅速发展。一些地区、县和一大批基层单位，已经建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构。
    从无产阶级文化大革命运动开始以来，吉林省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众把活学活用毛主席著作当成生活的第一需要。学习毛主席著作的群众运动，从来没有象现在这样广泛深入；落实毛主席的最新指示，从来没有象今天这样自觉。毛主席发出大办学习班的最新指示后，全省广大群众闻风而动，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，如雨后春笋，遍布城乡。据不完全统计，全省已开办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班近十万个，参加学习的达三百多万人。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，广大革命群众和红卫兵小将，在灵魂深处大闹革命，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，向私字开火，向派性宣战。他们大摆派性的罪状，大诉派性的危害，大挖派性的根源，打响了一场围剿派性的“人民战争”。
    许多单位的无产阶级革命派在学习班里学习了毛主席的最新指示，通过检查总结、回忆对比，找到各派革命群众之间有四大相同：一、爱相同，都无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想；二、恨相同，都恨旧社会，恨中国赫鲁晓夫，恨帝、修、反；三、路相同，都是走的毛主席指引的社会主义康庄大道；四、革命目标相同，都是为了夺取文化大革命的全面胜利，保证我国无产阶级专政的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色。他们说，这四大相同就是我们的根本利益，我们没有理由分成这个派，那个派，我们应该是一派，是毛泽东思想武装的革命派。春节以前，全省实现革命大联合的基层单位只有百分之四十，春节以后，就增加了将近一倍，达到近百分之八十。
    毛主席教导说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”各地举办的许多毛泽东思想学习班，吸收干部参加，或者专门组织革命派学习毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，有效地解决了干部问题。目前，省、地、市、县和许多基层单位都已经有一大批革命干部站了出来。
    战斗在吉林省“三支”、“两军”第一线的人民解放军广大指战员，认真执行支左不支派的原则，耐心地做了大量的思想政治工作，帮助革命群众、红卫兵小将克服派性，增强党性，为促进革命大联合和三结合作出了卓越贡献。
