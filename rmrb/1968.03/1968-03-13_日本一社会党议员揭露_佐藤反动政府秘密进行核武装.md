Japanese Socialist Party Member Exposes Sato Reactionary Government's Secret Nuclear Armament

	New China News Agency reports: According to East China News Agency, Japanese Socialist Party member Hayashi Yanosuke revealed in the Diet Budget Committee meeting on February 28 and 29 that the Sato government is secretly pursuing nuclear armament.

	Hayashi said that the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" already possess equipment capable of carrying nuclear weapons, but the warheads are still in the hands of the Americans. He pointed out that the "Nike" missiles of the "Self-Defense Forces" can be equipped with nuclear warheads; the new type of fighter jets recently used by the "Self-Defense Forces" can also carry nuclear weapons.

	Hayashi further revealed that the Sato government's third military expansion plan (1967 to 1971) secretly decided to manufacture missiles equipped with nuclear warheads.

	Hayashi emphasized that these facts show that the so-called "three non-nuclear principles" promised by Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato—"not to manufacture nuclear weapons, not to possess nuclear weapons, and not to allow nuclear weapons to enter the country"—are all lies.

	Hayashi's revelations left Sato Eisaku and the Japanese "Defense Agency" Director Masuda Koji in a state of panic. They initially claimed, "This is a secret, we cannot disclose it," but were later forced to admit that the Japanese military authorities had studied the issue of missiles equipped with nuclear warheads. The Budget Committee meeting fell into chaos due to this revelation.

　　日本一社会党议员揭露
　　佐藤反动政府秘密进行核武装
    新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本社会党议员楢崎弥之助二月二十八日和二十九日在众议院预算委员会会议上揭露，佐藤政府正在秘密地进行核武装。
    楢崎说，日本“自卫队”已经拥有载运核武器的装备，只是核弹头还掌握在美国手里。他指出，“自卫队”的“奈克”导弹可以装核弹头；“自卫队”最近使用的新型战斗机也可以运载核武器。
    楢崎还进一步揭露，佐藤政府的第三次扩军计划（一九六七年到一九七一年），决定秘密地制造装核弹头的导弹。
    楢崎强调指出，这些事实表明，日本首相佐藤荣作所“保证”的日本“不制造核武器、不持有核武器、不运进核武器”的所谓三原则，完全是骗人的鬼话。
    楢崎的揭露，使佐藤荣作和日本“防卫厅”长官增田甲子七狼狈不堪。他们先是说什么“这是秘密，不能说”，但后来被迫承认日本军事当局研究过装核弹头的导弹的问题。预算委员会会议由于这一揭露已陷入混乱状态。
