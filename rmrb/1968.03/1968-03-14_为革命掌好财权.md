Since the military training began at our Shunchang No. 1 Middle School, under the guidance of the PLA comrades, we have focused on class education and strictly enforced financial management, resulting in reduced expenditures. Now, our monthly total expenses are 60% less than before the military training.

Before the military training, our school had many mass organizations, with severe bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist tendencies rampant. At that time, various mass organizations all competed to demand office supplies, office equipment, and furniture from the school, leading to significant waste. After the military training began, the PLA leftist comrades and the school revolutionary committee believed that this phenomenon was not an isolated issue of daily life but a reflection of bourgeois ideology within our ranks, which must be resolutely overcome. They organized all teachers, students, and staff to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "frugal nation-building" and "further economizing to make revolution." Through study and discussion, everyone deeply understood that extravagance and waste are the beginning of "peaceful evolution" and the enemy of revolutionary cadres holding and using power correctly. We must resolutely resist and oppose them.

Over the past year, revolutionary teachers and students have made significant changes in economizing to make revolution. They have returned all the cash, grain tickets, and items they borrowed during their connections. They use inferior or substitute goods for stationery and supplies, and they make things themselves instead of asking others to do it. The school's expenses have been greatly reduced.

　　为革命掌好财权
    我们顺昌一中自从军政训练开始以后，在解放军同志的帮助下，狠抓阶级教育，严格财政管理制度，节约开支，支出不断减少，现在每月总开支比军训前节约了百分之六十。
    军训前，我校群众组织很多，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性严重，无政府主义思潮泛滥。那时，各个群众组织都竞相伸手向学校要办公费，要办公用品，要家具，造成很大浪费。军训开始后，解放军支左同志和校革命委员会认为，这种现象不是孤立的生活细节问题，而是资产阶级思想在我们队伍中的反映，必须坚决克服。他们组织全校师生员工学习毛主席关于
  “勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的教导，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫腐朽的资产阶级世界观。经过学习和讨论，大家深刻认识到，铺张浪费是“和平演变”的开始，是无产阶级革命派掌好权、用好权的大敌，必须坚决抵制，坚决反对。
    一年来，广大革命师生在节约闹革命方面已有很大转变。他们过去串连借支的现金、粮票和物品，凡能归还的，都归还了。文具用品能用次品的就用次品，能用代用品的就用代用品，能自己动手做的，决不请人做。全校开支大大缩减。
