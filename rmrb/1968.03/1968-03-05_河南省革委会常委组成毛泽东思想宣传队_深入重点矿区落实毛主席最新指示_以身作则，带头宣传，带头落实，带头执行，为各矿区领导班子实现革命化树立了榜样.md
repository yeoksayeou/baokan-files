The standing committee members of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, who participated in the first meeting of the committee, combined studying and understanding Chairman Mao's latest instructions with implementing them in practical struggles. During the meeting, a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team was formed by the standing committee members attending the meeting. They went to various key mining areas in Henan Province, engaged with the masses, and fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, effectively promoting the revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in these mining areas.

The first meeting of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee began in early February and has not yet concluded. The committee members attending the meeting carefully studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the beginning of the meeting and discussed the situation and tasks of the Cultural Revolution in Henan Province. They believed that the current fundamental task of the provincial revolutionary committee is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, lead the revolutionary people of the entire province to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. They followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and work together with the masses to make the Cultural Revolution better," and "You must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on every matter, and be a student of the masses." Shortly after the meeting began, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee was formed by the standing committee members attending the meeting. Led by Liu Jianxun, the chairman of the provincial revolutionary committee, and vice-chairmen Wang Xin, Ji Denggui, and Geng Qichang, they went to key coal mining areas such as Pingdingshan, Hebi, Jiaozuo, and Yiluo and Guanyintang in western Henan. They worked together with the broad revolutionary miners to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promoting revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in these mining areas.

After arriving at the various coal mining areas, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee immediately worked with local military personnel to go deep into the grassroots and among the masses, vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, assist the two revolutionary mass organizations in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and conduct thorough and detailed ideological and political work, effectively promoting the movement in the mining areas. Previously, the several revolutionary mass organizations in these places had been engaged in prolonged "internal warfare" and could not achieve revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. With the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the broad revolutionary workers in these places fought against selfishness, overthrew bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and now a tide of revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination has emerged. The two revolutionary mass organizations in the Pingdingshan area have achieved revolutionary unity, and five large coal mines have established revolutionary committees on the basis of revolutionary unity. The Hebi Mining Bureau and its seven affiliated coal mines have also achieved bottom-up revolutionary unity and are in the process of establishing revolutionary committees. Good news of revolutionary unity has also come from the Guanyintang Coal Mine in western Henan. The revolutionary situation in the mining areas has promoted a significant increase in coal production. The average daily output of various mines in the Pingdingshan area, the Hebi Mining Bureau, and the Jiaozuo Coal Mine in mid-February was significantly higher than in the previous week.

An important reason why the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee was able to drive the revolution and production in various mines to a new stage in a short period is that the standing committee members led by example, took the initiative to propagate, implement, and execute Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, and after arriving at the various mining areas, they adopted the attitude of being willing to be a student, went deep into the revolutionary miners, listened to opinions extensively, and worked in the mines as ordinary laborers, mobilizing the workers to seize the revolution and promote production. They used every opportunity to repeatedly propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, introduced the experiences of revolutionary masses in other regions following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, overcoming factionalism, and achieving revolutionary unity, thereby promoting revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in various mines. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee strictly adhered to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. The standing committee members who originally belonged to the two revolutionary mass organizations held high the banner of proletarian party spirit and firmly acted according to Mao Zedong Thought. They adopted a warm and friendly attitude towards all revolutionary mass organizations and did not favor one faction over another. For the actions of various mass organizations, they firmly and enthusiastically supported those that conformed to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and did not support those that did not conform, and patiently educated them to correct their mistakes consciously. Therefore, the propaganda team quickly gained the trust and support of the various factions.

Following Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, upon arriving at the various mining areas, worked with local military personnel to vigorously promote the joint holding of Mao Zedong Thought study classes by the two factions, conducted thorough and detailed ideological and political work, and fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieving good results. During the study classes, the leaders of many revolutionary mass organizations expressed their determination to overcome factionalism, strengthen party spirit, and contribute to promoting revolutionary unity.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee went deep into the grassroots and among the masses, swiftly and fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, setting an example for the leadership of various mining areas to achieve revolutionization. On the night of the day the revolutionary committee of Pingdingshan Mine No. 4 was established, the first meeting of the standing committee was held, deciding that all members of the revolutionary committee would not leave their production posts and resolutely be ordinary laborers who can go up and down. The members of various mine revolutionary committees mostly achieved going down to the mines to work with the workers, coming up to the mines to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism with the workers, taking the lead in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and promoting the mines to quickly launch a new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

The first meeting of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee will continue after the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams return to Zhengzhou from various places.

    河南省革委会常委组成毛泽东思想宣传队
    深入重点矿区落实毛主席最新指示
    以身作则，带头宣传，带头落实，带头执行，为各矿区领导班子实现革命化树立了榜样
    据新华社郑州四日电　参加河南省革命委员会第一次常委会议的常委们，把在会议上学习、领会毛主席的最新指示同到实际斗争中去贯彻落实结合起来。在会议期间，由参加会议的常委组成省革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传队，分赴河南省各重点矿区，深入群众，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，有力地促进了这些矿区的革命大联合和革命三结合。
    河南省革命委员会第一次常委会议，是从二月初开始的，现在还没有结束。参加会议的常委们，在会议开始时认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，讨论了河南省无产阶级文化大革命的形势和任务。他们认为，省革命委员会当前的根本任务，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，带领全省革命人民，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。他们遵循毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”，“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的伟大教导，在会议开始不久，就由出席会议的常委组成省革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传队，由省革命委员会主任刘建勋、副主任王新、纪登奎、耿启昌等同志带领，分赴平顶山、鹤壁、焦作和豫西的宜洛、观音堂等重点煤矿区，和广大革命矿工一起，去学习、落实毛主席的最新指示，促进这些矿区实现革命大联合和革命三结合。
    河南省革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传队到达各煤矿区后，立即会同当地驻军指战员，深入基层，深入群众，大力宣传毛主席的最新指示，协助两派革命群众组织举办毛泽东思想学习班，深入细致地做思想政治工作，有力地促进了矿区的运动。这些地方的几派革命群众组织，以前长期打“内战”，迟迟不能实现革命大联合和革命三结合。在省革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下广大革命职工狠斗“私”字，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，现在已经出现了革命大联合、革命三结合的热潮。平顶山地区的两派革命群众组织已经实现了革命大联合，五个大煤矿都在革命大联合的基础上，建立了矿革命委员会。鹤壁矿务局及其所属七个煤矿，也都实现了自下而上的革命大联合，正在建立革命委员会。豫西的观音堂煤矿也传来了革命大联合的喜讯。矿区的大好革命形势，促进了煤炭生产的大幅度上升。平顶山地区各矿、鹤壁矿务局和焦作煤矿，二月中旬的平均日产量都比上旬大幅度提高。
    省革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传队在短时间内推动各矿革命、生产出现新局面，一个重要原因是常委们以身作则，带头宣传、带头落实、带头执行毛主席的最新指示。他们遵循毛主席的教导，到各矿区以后，以甘当小学生的态度，深入到革命矿工中去，广泛听取意见，并以普通劳动者身份下井劳动，带动工人群众抓革命促生产。他们利用一切机会反复宣传毛主席的最新指示，介绍其他地区革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，打倒派性，实现革命大联合的经验，因而促进了各矿的革命大联合和革命三结合。省革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传队严格执行支左不支派的原则。原属两派革命群众组织的常委们，高举无产阶级党性旗帜，坚决按照毛泽东思想办事。对各派革命群众都采取热情亲近的态度，不亲一派疏一派。对各派群众组织的言行，凡是符合毛主席的最新指示的，都坚决地、热情地支持；凡是不符合毛主席的最新指示的，都不支持，并且耐心地教育他们自觉改正。因此，宣传队很快地得到了各派群众的信任和支持。
    省革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导，在到达各矿区后，同当地驻军一起，大力推动两派群众组织联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，认真地、细致地做思想政治工作，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，收到了很好的效果。在学习班学习的过程中，许多革命群众组织的头头纷纷表示，决心打倒派性，增强党性，为促进革命大联合作出贡献。
    省革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传队深入基层，深入群众，雷厉风行地全面落实毛主席的最新指示，为各矿区领导班子实现革命化树立了榜样。平顶山四矿革命委员会成立后的当天夜晚，召开了第一次常委会议，决定全体革委会成员都不脱离生产岗位，坚决做一个能上能下的普通劳动者。各矿革命委员会的成员，大都做到下井同工人一起劳动，上井同工人一起斗私批修，带头落实毛主席的最新指示，推动各矿很快掀起了抓革命，促生产的新高潮。
    河南省革命委员会第一次常委会议，将在赴各地的毛泽东思想宣传队返回郑州后继续进行。
