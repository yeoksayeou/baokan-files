The U.S. aggressors, who have been beaten back by the Vietnamese people's New Year Offensive, have recently rushed another 1,050 American invaders to the South Vietnamese battlefield to serve as cannon fodder.

According to Western news agencies, the newly dispatched 4,000 paratroopers from the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and 6,500 marines from the 5th Marine Division arrived in the northern South Vietnamese city of Da Nang at the end of February. This brings the total number of U.S. troops in Vietnam to over 510,000.

In a desperate attempt to salvage the deteriorating situation, the U.S. imperialists, who are facing a shortage of troops, have also planned to redeploy some of the U.S. forces stationed in Da Nang to areas south of the Demilitarized Zone for "emergency" use.

　　美国侵略者又向南越送炮灰一万多
　　据新华社讯　西贡消息：被越南南方军民的新春攻势打得焦头烂额的美帝国主义，最近又向南越战场紧急增派美国侵略军一万零五百名，充当炮灰。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国新增派的第八十二空降师一个旅的四千名伞兵和海军陆战队第五师的六千五百名侵略军于二月底先后被运到南越北部岘港地区。这样，侵越美军总数超过了五十一万人。
    兵源枯竭的美帝国主义为了挽救败局，还采取剜肉补疮的办法，计划抽调一部分驻在岘港地区的美军到非军事区以南地区去“应急”。
