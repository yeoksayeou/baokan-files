Under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's March 7th directive, and with the patient help of the PLA comrades responsible for military training, the revolutionary young soldiers of Class 1(5) of Beijing No. 36 Middle School are growing vigorously.

The PLA Sets a Fine Example

One day, the entire school of revolutionary teachers and students went to Changping County to participate in labor. Class 1(5) stayed in a large empty room in Fengshan Village. After laying down the straw mats, Teacher Fang placed her own bedding in the position closest to the door. The students did not pay much attention and laid out their own beds.

During the night, a cold wind woke up Teacher Fang, who was sleeping by the door. She remembered the exemplary actions of Zhang, the PLA platoon leader, who cared for the students with meticulous attention. She immediately got up quietly and checked each bed, covering up the students who had not covered themselves properly. For those whose blankets were thin, she added her own clothes on top.

The cold wind also woke up Xu Shuping, who was sleeping next to Teacher Fang. She opened her eyes and saw that Teacher Fang was not there. She immediately thought, "Why did Teacher Fang place her bedding in the position closest to the door first?" She thought, "I really didn't notice. Teacher Fang marched with us during the day and even helped us carry things. She is older and won't be able to sleep well like this." So, she moved to Teacher Fang's bed.

Teacher Fang came back and saw someone on her bed. Upon closer inspection, she saw it was Xu Shuping. She understood everything. She thought, "The students have changed. Xu Shuping, who used to have the most complaints about me, has also changed. After Chairman Mao's call to 'criticize and repudiate revisionism,' our hearts are united." She leaned over and whispered in Xu Shuping's ear, "You should sleep inside, don't catch a cold." Xu Shuping suddenly sat up and said, "Chairman Mao has long taught us to be selfless and dedicated to others. I want to follow Chairman Mao's words." The two argued until they finally compromised and slept together.

The next day, the students learned about this and everyone wanted to sleep in that position. Teacher Fang repeatedly persuaded everyone, and finally, Wang Zongxin exchanged his thick quilt with Teacher Fang.

This incident deeply moved the entire class. They said, "Teacher Fang loves us just like the PLA."

Selfless Dedication

One day, the revolutionary committee decided to allocate one hundred new desks and chairs to the class. Teacher Fang told the entire class about this, immediately sparking a strong reaction. Some said, "Our class's desks and chairs are better than those of other classes. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and give the convenience to others, leaving the difficulties for ourselves. We cannot accept these one hundred new desks and chairs." Others said, "It was the revolutionary committee that allocated them to us, not something we asked for, so it is completely reasonable to accept them." The debate was intense.

Yi Xiaoxing and Li Jing were a "red pair." That night, they studied Chairman Mao's works seriously regarding the debate over the one hundred new desks and chairs. Chairman Mao said, "All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other." Chairman Mao's teachings made them realize that accepting or not accepting the new desks and chairs was a struggle between two kinds of thoughts: putting others first or oneself first? This was a major issue of whether our Red Guards, following Chairman Mao, put "public" first or "private" first. They immediately wrote a proposal, suggesting that the entire class follow Chairman Mao's teachings of selflessness and dedication, and give the new desks and chairs to other classes.

After reading the proposal, the students spontaneously gathered to discuss. Finally, everyone unanimously decided to give the one hundred new desks and chairs to other classes. To save expenses, they carried the one hundred new desks and chairs from a factory a few miles away, cleaned them, and handed them over to the revolutionary committee. They deeply felt, "These one hundred new desks and chairs gave us the most practical lesson in criticizing and repudiating revisionism."

The Power of the "Three Articles"

In the past, Ding Guolin was known as a "troublemaker" in the class. From teachers to classmates, everyone found her "thorny" and difficult to do ideological work with.

During a down-to-the-countryside labor session, the entire class worked while engaging in the struggle to criticize and repudiate revisionism. Ding Guolin thought, "If it's about criticizing revisionism, I have a lot to say; if it's about criticizing oneself, I have nothing to say."

One night, the military training platoon leader exposed his private thoughts in front of the entire class. Then, the deputy platoon leader and class leader also took the lead in exposing their private thoughts. Everyone spoke from the heart, exposing and criticizing without fear of embarrassment or pain. Ding Guolin listened and thought deeply, feeling a great shock. She didn't sleep well that night, thinking, "Why can the platoon leader criticize himself so well? Ultimately, it's because they have a heart loyal to Chairman Mao and dedicated to serving the people wholeheartedly." She thought about herself and felt that she was not without private thoughts, but she had not yet established a thorough and complete thought of serving the people.

The next morning, as soon as it was light, she took up the "Three Articles" and read them word by word. The more she read, the fresher and more intimate she felt. She could no longer contain her excitement and immediately wrote a speech manuscript for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. She exposed her private thoughts in the class and platoon meetings. Her progress was immediately welcomed by the entire class.

From then on, the classmates all said she had changed. She said, "It is the great thought of Mao Zedong that made me recognize myself and pointed out the direction for me to advance. I will strive to study Chairman Mao's works and become a revolutionary who is determined to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end."

　　雨露滋润禾苗壮
　　于志星
    在毛主席“三·七”指示的光辉照耀下，在负责军训的解放军同志的耐心帮助下，北京市三十六中一（五）班的革命小将正在茁壮成长。
    解放军是好榜样
    一天，全校革命师生来到了昌平县参加劳动。一（五）班住在丰善村一间大空房里。铺草铺好了，方老师把自己的被褥，放在紧靠门边的铺位上。同学们没有在意，都把自己的铺位铺好了。
    夜间，阵阵寒风把睡在门边的方老师吹醒了。她想起解放军张排长无微不至地爱护同学的模范行动，立即轻轻地起来，逐个地检查了一遍，替没有盖好被子的同学盖好被子，有的同学被子薄，就把衣服给她们压上。
    寒风也把紧靠着方老师睡的许淑平同学吹醒了。她睁眼一看，方老师不在了，她立刻想到，方老师为什么第一个把被褥放在门边的铺位上。哎！我真没留意，方老师白天和我们一起行军，还帮我们拿东西，她年岁大，睡不好怎么行？于是，她睡到了方老师睡的铺位上。
    方老师回来一看，自己的铺位上有人了，仔细一瞧，是许淑平同学。她心里完全明白了。她心想：同学们都变了，过去对我意见最多的许淑平也变了。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的号召以后，我们的心贴在一起了。她把嘴贴在小许的耳边，小声地说：“你快到里边睡，不要冻着了。”小许忽地坐起来，说：“毛主席早就教导我们，要毫不利己专门利人。我要听毛主席的话。”两人争到最后只好妥协，挤在一起睡了。
    第二天，同学们知道了这件事，人人都争着要睡这个铺位。方老师一再说服大家，最后王宗新同学把自己的厚被子换给了方老师。
    这件事，使全班同学都很受感动。她们说：“方老师和解放军一样爱护我们。”
    毫不利己专门利人
    一天，校革命委员会决定分配给这个班一百张新桌椅。方老师把这件事告诉了全班同学，立即引起了强烈的反响。有的说：“我们班的桌椅比其他班的还好，我们要牢记毛主席的教导，把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己，这一百张新桌椅不能要。”有的说：“是革命委员会分给我们的，又不是咱们伸手要的，完全有理由接收。”互相辩论得很激烈。
    易小兴和李静同学是“一对红”。晚上，她俩针对一百张新桌椅的争论，认真地学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”毛主席的教导使她俩认识到：要和不要新桌椅，这是两种思想的斗争，是他人第一，还是自己第一？这是衡量我们毛主席的红卫兵是“公”字当头，还是“私”字当头的大问题。于是她们连夜写了倡议书，建议全班同学按照毛主席的毫不利己专门利人的教导办事，把新桌椅让给其他班级。
    同学们看了这份倡议书后，自动地围拢在一起讨论。最后，大家一致决定：这一百张新桌椅让给其他班。为了节省开支，她们把这一百张新桌椅从两三里路外的工厂搬了回来，擦洗干净，交给了革委会。她们深有感触地说：“这一百张新桌椅，给我们上了一堂最实际的斗私批修课。”
    “老三篇”的威力
    过去，丁果林同学是班里有名的“刺头”，从老师到同学，都感到她“扎手”，碰不得，不好做思想政治工作。
    一次下乡劳动时，全班同学一面劳动，一面投入了斗私批修战斗。丁果林想：要批修，我有的说；要斗私，我可没的说。
    一天晚上，军训排长在全班师生面前亮了自己的私心。接着，副排长和班长也带头亮私。大家心里有啥说啥，边亮边批，不怕丑，不怕痛。小丁边听边想，思想上震动很大。她一夜没有睡好觉，心想：排长他们为什么斗私斗得那么好呢？归根结底，是他们有一颗忠于毛主席、全心全意为人民服务的红心。她又想想自己，觉得并不是没有私心，而是自己还没有树立完全、彻底为人民服务的思想。
    第二天天刚亮，她就拿起“老三篇”一字一句地读，越读越觉得新鲜，越读越觉得亲切。她再也按捺不住内心的激动，马上拿起笔写了斗私批修发言稿，先后在班、排上亮了自己的私心。她的进步立刻得到了全班的欢迎。
    从那以后，同学们都说她变了。她说：“这是伟大的毛泽东思想使我认识了自己，给我指明了前进的方向。我要努力学习毛主席著作，做一个‘决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派’。”
