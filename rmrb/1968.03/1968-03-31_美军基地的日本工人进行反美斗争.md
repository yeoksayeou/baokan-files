	More than 1,500 Japanese workers at the U.S. military airport in Zushi, Japan, went on strike for three consecutive days from March 13 to 15. They protested against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. The workers erected red flags at the airport gate and set up picket lines, preventing 160 trucks carrying aviation fuel for the U.S. military from moving.

	In the city of Sagamihara, more than 5,000 Japanese workers at the U.S. military general depot went on strike for three days starting from March 13. They refused to repair the U.S. military tanks and other vehicles that had been severely damaged by the heroic Vietnamese military and people.

    在日本厚木美军机场劳动的一千五百多名日本工人，从三月十三日到十五日的三天里，连续举行罢工，反对美帝侵略越南。工人们在机场大门前竖起红旗，建立了纠察队，迫使运输美军航空汽油的一百六十辆汽车不能行驶。
    在相模原市美军综合兵站，五千多名日本工人从三月十三日起举行了三天的罢工，拒绝修理被英雄的越南军民打得千疮百孔的美军破坦克和其他军车。
