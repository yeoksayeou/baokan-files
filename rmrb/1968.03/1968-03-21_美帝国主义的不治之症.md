Since the devaluation of the pound last November, the entire capitalist world has experienced the most severe financial and monetary crisis since 1929. Especially since late February this year, a frenzy of gold buying has swept through the major capitalist countries, showing no signs of abating. The United States has been forced to dump large quantities of gold, yet it has been unable to stop this trend. The dollar, which has been a symbol of American imperialist power and dominated the capitalist world after World War II, is on the verge of collapse. The capitalist financial and monetary system, with the dollar as its core, is beginning to crumble. This financial crisis in the capitalist world, centered around the dollar, has thoroughly exposed the hollow and weak nature of American imperialism, revealing the extreme decay and decline of the imperialist system.

Desperate measures for a desperate situation. American imperialism hastily demanded that Britain close the London gold market, and at the same time, it rallied some major capitalist countries to hold a two-day "emergency meeting" in Washington to discuss strategies to save the dollar. They were forced to announce that in the future, official transactions between capitalist countries would continue to be conducted at the current exchange rate between the dollar and gold, while in the "free market," private transactions would allow gold prices to rise. American imperialism hopes to use this method to maintain the dollar's position.

However, this method will not save the dollar.

The frenzy of gold buying in the capitalist world is due to the severe shake in dollar confidence. People, fearing that the dollar will be devalued, are rushing to sell their dollars and buy gold. Now, the Washington meeting has decided to implement a two-tier gold trading system with dual pricing, which is essentially an admission of the dollar's devaluation. This will not only fail to save the dollar's credit but will, on the contrary, make the dollar's credit plummet even further. This stopgap measure, even if it helps the United States temporarily cope with the difficult situation, will only breed greater crises.

The Johnson administration hopes to use this to catch its breath, so it can take some measures to reduce the domestic budget deficit and international trade deficit, and improve the dollar's position. But what miracle cure can it find? Increase taxes? Expand exports? Reduce capital outflows? All these measures are not only difficult to implement but will also exacerbate the already crisis-ridden U.S. economy, intensifying trade wars and currency wars among imperialist countries. The result will only accelerate the complete collapse of the dollar and the capitalist monetary system centered around the dollar, bringing the capitalist world economic crisis even faster.

The dollar crisis is the result of the failure of American imperialism's aggressive and war policies, and its weakening strength; it is the result of the inherent contradictions of the imperialist system, especially the intensifying contradictions between American imperialism and the peoples of various countries. After being fattened by the two world wars, American imperialism, after World War II, established the "hegemony" of the dollar in the capitalist world with its greatly expanded economic power. It used the dollar, which had obtained the privilege of being the "world currency," to invade, control, interfere with, and bully other countries. However, those who sow thorns will reap thorns. American imperialism can only reap the bitter fruits. The struggle of the people of the world, especially the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, has dragged American imperialism to the point of exhaustion. The mad expansion and meddling of American imperialism, its massive overseas military spending and capital outflows, have resulted in long-term severe international trade deficits. Meanwhile, Western European countries, in their opposition to American control and their struggle for financial hegemony, have taken advantage of various means to undermine the credit of the dollar. Thus, the dollar crisis has become an incurable disease for American imperialism. All efforts by the American ruling class are obviously in vain.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "We are now in an era when the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse, and the imperialists have fallen into an insoluble crisis."

The dollar crisis and the overall financial and monetary crisis in the capitalist world mark the accelerating collapse of the imperialist system in the face of the revolutionary storm sweeping the world. The east wind prevails, and the west wind declines. The international situation is more favorable to the revolutionary people of the world and less favorable to imperialism and all reactionaries. No matter how desperately American imperialism struggles, victory will definitely belong to the revolutionary people of the world.

    美帝国主义的不治之症
    本报评论员
    去年十一月英镑贬值以来，整个资本主义世界爆发了一九二九年以来最严重的一场金融货币危机。特别是今年二月底以后，抢购黄金的狂潮席卷各主要资本主义国家，大有不可收拾之势。美国被迫抛出了大量的黄金，依然不能遏止这股风潮。作为美帝国主义实力象征、战后在资本主义世界曾经称霸一时的美元，眼看就要垮台。以美元为主体的资本主义金融货币体系，开始崩溃。这场以美元危机为中心的资本主义世界金融危机，彻底暴露了美帝国主义这只纸老虎的外强中干的虚弱本质，暴露了帝国主义制度的极端腐朽和日益没落。
    病笃乱投医。美帝国主义慌忙要求英国关闭伦敦黄金市场，同时纠集一些主要资本主义国家，在华盛顿举行了两天“紧急会议”，商量挽救美元的对策。它们迫不得已地宣布，今后在各资本主义国家官方之间，仍然按照目前美元同黄金的比价进行交易，而在“自由市场”上私人的交易中，则听任黄金涨价。美帝国主义企图用这个办法，来维持美元的地位。
    但是，这个办法根本救不了美元的命。
    资本主义世界抢购黄金的风潮，是由于美元信用的严重动摇而引起的。人们因为担心美元宣布贬值，所以争相抛售手中的美元而抢购黄金。现在，华盛顿会议决定实行黄金交易两个市场、双重价格，就实际上等于宣告了美元的贬值。这不但不能挽救美元的信用，恰恰相反，只能使美元的信用更加一落千丈。这种权宜之计，即便能够帮助美国暂时应付一下困难的局面，但是却孕育着更大的危机。
    约翰逊政府企图借此喘一口气，以便采取一些措施来减少国内财政赤字和国际收支逆差，来改善美元的地位。但是，它能找到什么灵丹妙药呢？增加税收吗？扩大出口吗？削减资本输出吗？所有这些办法不但实行起来困难重重，而且将会促使已经面临危机的美国经济进一步恶化，促使帝国主义国家之间的贸易战和货币战更加尖锐化。结果，只能加速美元彻底垮台的进程，加速以美元为主体的资本主义货币体系的彻底崩溃，使资本主义世界经济大危机来得更快。
    美元危机，是美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策遭到失败、它的实力日益削弱的结果；是帝国主义制度固有的各种矛盾，特别是美帝国主义同各国人民之间的矛盾日益激化的结果。在两次世界大战中喂肥起来的美帝国主义，第二次世界大战以后凭着它的大大膨胀了的经济实力，在资本主义世界树立了美元的“霸权”。它利用取得“世界货币”特权地位的美元，到处侵略、控制、干涉和欺负别的国家。但是，种蒺藜者得刺，美帝国主义只能收获恶果。全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，特别是越南人民的抗美救国斗争，把美帝国主义拖得精疲力竭。美帝国主义的疯狂扩张和到处伸手，它的大量海外军费开支和资本输出，造成了长期严重的国际收支赤字。与此同时，西欧国家为了反对美国的控制，同美国争夺金融霸权，乘机利用各种手段来打击美元的信用。这样，美元危机就成了美帝国主义的一个不治之症。美国统治集团的一切努力，显然都是徒劳的。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席曾经指出：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。
    美元危机和整个资本主义世界的金融货币危机，标志着帝国主义制度在席卷全世界的革命风暴中正在加速走向全面崩溃。东风浩荡，西风衰微。国际形势更加有利于全世界革命人民而不利于帝国主义和一切反动派。不管美帝国主义进行怎样的垂死挣扎，胜利一定属于全世界革命人民。
