The military and civilians in the three provinces of Xining, Tuy Hoa, and Tien Giang near Saigon in South Vietnam have taken the initiative on the battlefield. From March 7th to 18th, they repelled various "sweeping" operations by the U.S. and puppet forces and launched continuous attacks, achieving the significant victory of annihilating over 1,500 enemy forces.

The report states that on the 7th, the local forces in Tra Vinh County, Xining Province, launched a fierce attack on a U.S. military unit that had just been air-dropped to the north of Tra Vinh Town, annihilating 300 U.S. soldiers and rendering the enemy command and artillery positions paralyzed. From the 8th to the 10th, the local forces and guerrilla units in Tra Vinh County launched multiple attacks on the enemy, killing and wounding over 160 U.S. soldiers. A female guerrilla unit annihilated an entire U.S. platoon and shot down two helicopters.

The people's liberation forces in Tuy Hoa Province annihilated 565 U.S. and puppet soldiers and a puppet company from the 16th to the 18th. In the early hours of the 16th, the people's liberation forces attacked the U.S. and puppet military officers' quarters in Tuy Hoa City. After a few minutes of fierce battle, they annihilated 120 U.S. "advisors," 150 puppet soldiers, and a guard company, destroying many barracks. At the same time, the people's liberation forces also captured two enemy outposts and strongholds in Chau Thanh County, killing 50 enemy soldiers and wounding many more. On the 17th and 18th, the guerrilla units and local forces continuously ambushed and attacked enemy positions, annihilating 245 U.S. aggressor soldiers, including an entire company.

Additionally, from the 12th to the 14th, the local forces and guerrilla units in Ben Cat and Chau Thanh Counties in Tuy Hoa Province also continuously ambushed the enemy, annihilating over 130 U.S. soldiers and destroying or damaging 17 tanks and armored vehicles.

During these days, the people in various communes in Dinh Tuong County also cut off the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th highways, paralyzing the enemy's transportation.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 27th, the battlefront in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam has seen frequent victories. The people's liberation forces in Gia Lai, Kon Tum, and Dac Lac provinces have recently launched continuous attacks on the enemy, achieving many victories.

According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the people's liberation forces in Gia Lai Province achieved three victories in one day on the 15th, annihilating three enemy convoys, destroying 60 military vehicles, and annihilating over 100 U.S. aggressor soldiers.

The report states that on the 15th, the people's liberation forces in Gia Lai Province ambushed an enemy convoy on Highway 19. When the first enemy convoy entered the ambush circle, the people's liberation forces, after a few minutes of battle, destroyed 21 military vehicles, killed and wounded many U.S. aggressor soldiers, and seized many weapons. Then, the second enemy convoy also fell into another ambush circle of the people's liberation forces. Twenty-six military vehicles loaded with military supplies were all destroyed or damaged, a large amount of military supplies were burned, and many U.S. aggressor soldiers were annihilated.

Subsequently, the people's liberation forces, with the spirit of continuous battle, ambushed and annihilated the enemy's third convoy on the same day on this highway, destroying 13 military vehicles, burning a large amount of military supplies, and annihilating many U.S. aggressor soldiers.

According to Western news agencies, from the 24th to the 26th, the people's liberation forces in Gia Lai, Kon Tum, and Dac Lac provinces continuously and fiercely bombarded the enemy's facilities in Pleiku and Ban Me Thuot cities, the U.S. military airport in Kon Tum City, and the U.S. 4th Infantry Division's artillery base west of Kon Tum City, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.
