In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad female members of the Dazhai Brigade in Dazhai Commune, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, have a heart full of loyalty, firmly grasp the use of Mao Zedong Thought, and more consciously study Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely combat selfishness and criticize revisionism, striding forward on the path of thought revolutionization.

The women of Dazhai are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely love Mao Zedong Thought. They say: "Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary books, books for women to rise up and seek liberation. We will read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for a lifetime." "Among a thousand things and ten thousand things, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the first big thing." In the great waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the women of Dazhai, with profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, bring problems from class struggle, and eagerly study Chairman Mao's works. They truly achieve: heavy household chores do not drag them down; lack of education does not deter them; busy work does not press them down; they study and apply, seeing immediate results. The more the broad female members study and apply Chairman Mao's works, the deeper their proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao become.

The women of Dazhai believe that to be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and truly master the great Mao Zedong Thought, one must constantly strengthen the consciousness of class struggle and the consciousness of line struggle, and in struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, constantly enhancing revolutionary consciousness. The women of Dazhai respond to Chairman Mao's call to "care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," and at the critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, they raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight shoulder to shoulder with the broad revolutionary masses, and launch a heroic struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the former Shanxi Provincial Committee, Jinzhong Regional Committee, and Xiyang County Committee, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Together with the broad revolutionary masses, they use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, purging its poison. With deep class hatred, they denounce and criticize Liu Shaoqi in big and small meetings, in the fields, and in their homes, setting up a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, exposing, accusing, and criticizing Liu Shaoqi. They say, Liu Shaoqi advocates the counter-revolutionary fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms," attempting to restore capitalism in China's rural areas, making us poor and lower-middle peasants suffer again. We will never agree! The revolutionary criticism greatly raised the ideological awareness of the women of Dazhai. They love Chairman Mao more, love Mao Zedong Thought more, and love Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line more. With deep emotion, they say: "Our mother gave birth to us, but it is the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that nurtured our growth!"

The women of Dazhai raise high the banner of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," setting up a battlefield for eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, and making a revolution in their souls. They say: "The more we fight selfishness, the closer we are to Chairman Mao; the more we criticize revisionism, the tighter we follow Chairman Mao." They regard eliminating one more bit of selfishness as adding one more bit of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Female member Jia Mangni studies and applies "Old Three Articles," using the two measures of "completely" and "thoroughly" to often examine herself, and using the three shining examples of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man Moving Mountains to often inspire herself, fiercely fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, greatly raising her ideological awareness. She overcomes the difficulties of having many children and heavy household chores, insisting on grasping revolution and promoting production, working over 200 days last year.

After more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the women of Dazhai stand taller and see farther. They link their every word and deed to the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and to supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. They have a heart for all of China and eyes for the whole world. Last year, Dazhai Brigade achieved a bumper harvest, and the grain distributed to the members increased, but the women of Dazhai remember Chairman Mao's consistent teachings and his latest instruction to "further economize and make revolution," economizing and living frugally, being thrifty in running the household, and being thrifty in all undertakings, actively suggesting to sell more grain to the state. They say, our lives in Dazhai have improved, but there are still many suffering peoples in the world whose lives are not good. We must economize on grain to support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

The heroic women of Dazhai are determined to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve new victories in the great struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    努力学习毛泽东思想，增强革命自觉性
    大寨女社员胸怀全中国放眼全世界
    据新华社太原七日电　在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队的广大女社员，心怀一个“忠”字，狠抓一个“用”字，更加自觉地学习毛泽东思想，狠斗私猛批修，在思想革命化的大道上阔步前进。
    大寨妇女无限忠于毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想。她们说：“毛主席的书，是革命的书，是妇女翻身求解放的书，我们要读一辈子毛主席的书，跟毛主席干一辈子革命。”“千件事，万件事，活学活用毛主席著作是第一件大事。”在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中，大寨妇女怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，带着阶级斗争中的问题，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，真正做到了：家务重，拖不倒；没文化，难不倒；工作忙，压不倒；学了就用，立竿见影。广大女社员越活学活用毛主席著作，对毛主席的无产阶级感情越深厚。
    大寨妇女认为，忠于伟大领袖毛主席，真正把伟大的毛泽东思想学到手，必须不断增强阶级斗争的观念，增强路线斗争的观念，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，不断增强革命自觉性。大寨妇女响应毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同广大革命群众并肩战斗，向原山西省委、晋中地委、昔阳县委内一小撮走资派展开英勇斗争，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。她们和广大革命群众一起，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和他推行的反革命修正主义路线，肃清其流毒。她们怀着满腔的阶级仇恨，人人口诛笔伐，在大会小会，在田间地头，在家庭炕头，大摆革命大批判的战场，对中国赫鲁晓夫展开了大揭发、大控诉、大批判。她们说，中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命谬论，妄图在中国农村复辟资本主义，使我们贫下中农再吃二遍苦，再受二遍罪，我们决不答应！革命的大批判，大大提高了大寨妇女的思想觉悟。她们更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱毛泽东思想，更加热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。她们满怀深情地说：“生我是娘，哺育我们成长的是伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想！”
    大寨妇女高举“斗私，批修”的大旗，大摆破私立公的战场，在灵魂深处闹革命。她们说：“斗私越深，对毛主席越亲；批修越狠，跟毛主席越紧。”她们把多斗掉一分私心，看作是多增一分对毛主席的忠心。女社员贾忙妮，大学大用“老三篇”，用“完全”“彻底”这两把尺子经常衡量自己，用张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象经常激励自己，狠斗私心，狠批修正主义，思想觉悟大大提高。她克服孩子多家务事重的困难，坚持抓革命、促生产，去年出勤二百多天。
    经过一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，大寨妇女站得更高了，看得更远了。她们把自己的一言一行，都同反帝反修斗争，同支援世界人民的革命斗争联系起来。她们胸怀全中国，放眼全世界。去年大寨大队夺得特大丰收，社员分配的粮食多了，收入增加了，但是大寨妇女牢记毛主席的一贯教导和“要进一步节约闹革命”的最新指示，省吃俭用，勤俭持家，勤俭办一切事业，积极建议多交售粮食给国家。她们说，我们大寨的生活好了，但世界上还有广大的受苦受难的人民生活不好，我们要节约粮食，支援世界革命人民的革命斗争。
    英雄的大寨妇女决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中立新功。
