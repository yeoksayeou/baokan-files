The first conference of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary peasants in Nanning, the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, was held on March 22. This conference is a rally for the 100,000 poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanning to hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, to be absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and to be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It aims to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The preparatory group of the Guangxi Revolutionary Committee, the Guangxi Military Region, and the responsible officials of the Nanning garrison, including Wei Guoqing, Ou Zhifu, Wei Youzhu, Jiao Hongguang, Wu Jinnan, and An Pingsheng, attended the conference.

The representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary peasants in Nanning summarized and exchanged experiences from the past year on safeguarding Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They decided to continue to establish and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The conference expressed that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary peasants in Nanning must hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, place the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and heavier than everything. They must be models in studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and be pioneers in criticizing and repudiating private thoughts and modifying revisionism. They must thoroughly expose the heinous crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, represented by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Guangxi who are attempting to restore capitalism. They must thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They must resolutely respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production," muster great enthusiasm, strive to be the best, and win the first battle of spring plowing. They will strive to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and create new achievements.

An Pingsheng, on behalf of the preparatory group of the autonomous region's revolutionary committee, the Guangxi Military Region, and the Nanning garrison, extended warm congratulations to the conference.

The conference passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and a letter to all poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary peasants in the city.
