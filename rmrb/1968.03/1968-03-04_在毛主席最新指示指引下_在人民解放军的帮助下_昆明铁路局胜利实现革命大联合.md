Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 3rd: The revolutionary mass organizations of the Kunming Railway Bureau, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have recently achieved revolutionary great unity.

On February 28th, more than 14,000 people, including revolutionary workers from the Kunming Railway Bureau and its affiliated departments in Yiliang, Kaiyuan, Anning, Lufeng, Yangfangwa, and Qujing, representatives of revolutionary mass organizations from all over the province, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, held a grand celebration meeting.

The Kunming Railway Bureau is responsible for the important transportation tasks of developing agriculture and industry in Yunnan and strengthening national defense construction. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers of the Kunming Railway system played a leading role and made tremendous contributions. Due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, the Kunming Railway system once faced a situation where the two revolutionary factions were opposed to each other. Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and with the help of the People's Liberation Army in carrying out the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, they took "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, recalled their history of fighting side by side, seriously summed up the lessons of splitting and fighting "internal wars," made self-criticisms, and resolutely overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhancing proletarian party spirit. After full consultations, representatives of the two revolutionary mass organizations reached an agreement in January in Beijing to achieve revolutionary great unity. After returning to Kunming, the representatives immediately conveyed to the broad revolutionary workers the warm care of the proletarian headquarters led by the great leader Chairman Mao for the revolutionary workers of the railway, greatly inspiring and educating the broad revolutionary workers. They expressed their determination to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions as quickly as possible. In recent times, the revolutionary workers of various units in the Kunming Railway system have achieved revolutionary great unity under revolutionary principles. At the same time, a new situation has emerged in transportation and production.

Leaders of the PLA units stationed in Kunming and the Yunnan Provincial Military Region, including Ru Ruilin, Liu Maogong, Cui Wenbin, and Wang Yinshan, attended the meeting to offer warm congratulations. The leader of the Kunming unit, Ru Ruilin, spoke at the meeting. He highly praised the revolutionary great unity of the two revolutionary mass organizations in the Kunming Railway system, setting an example for the revolutionary mass organizations in Yunnan Province and Kunming City, and greatly promoting the rapid arrival of the revolutionary great unity high tide in Yunnan Province and Kunming City.

The representative of the Revolutionary Great Unity Committee of the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction of the Kunming Railway Bureau spoke, expressing their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, strive to run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in all aspects. Struggle against selfishness, attack factionalism, consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity, promote revolutionary three-in-one combination. Further implement Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army and love the people," firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, support and assist the People's Liberation Army in doing the "three supports, two militaries" work. Enhance revolutionary vigilance, prevent class enemies from sowing discord. Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," firmly guard work posts, observe labor discipline, persist in revolutionary activities in spare time, save money for revolution, and carry out revolution on the spot, launching a new high tide in railway transportation and production.

The meeting concluded with thunderous applause and cheers, and a telegram of respect was sent to the great leader Chairman Mao. After the meeting, a celebratory parade was held.

    人民解放军驻昆明部队和云南省军区负责人鲁瑞林、刘懋功、崔文斌、王银山等同志到会热烈祝贺。昆明部队负责人鲁瑞林在大会上讲了话。他高度赞扬昆明铁路系统两派革命群众组织的革命大联合，为云南省、昆明市各革命群众组织树立了榜样，将有力地促进云南省、昆明市革命大联合高潮的迅速到来。
    昆明铁路局无产阶级革命派大联合委员会代表在讲话中表示，一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在人民解放军的帮助下，努力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示。狠斗私字，猛攻派性，巩固和发展革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合。进一步贯彻执行毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，坚决相信和依靠人民解放军，支持和协助人民解放军做好“三支”“两军”工作。提高革命警惕，严防阶级敌人挑拨离间。坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，坚守工作岗位，遵守劳动纪律，坚持业余闹革命，节约闹革命，就地闹革命，掀起铁路运输生产的新高潮。
