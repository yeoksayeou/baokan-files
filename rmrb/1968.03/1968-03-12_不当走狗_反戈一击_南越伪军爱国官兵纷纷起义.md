In the face of the powerful Tet Offensive launched by the military and people of South Vietnam, large numbers of patriotic soldiers in the puppet army of South Vietnam have risen up and defected to the people's side.

In the province of Tra Vinh, from January 31 to February 28, 712 soldiers from 34 outposts and sentry posts defected to the people, bringing with them a large amount of weapons. They declared their determination to fight alongside the people to resist American imperialism and its puppets, and to achieve a complete victory.

In the districts of Chau Thanh and Chau My of Tra Vinh province, 200 soldiers from 18 outposts and sentry posts staged a mutiny, destroyed the outposts and sentry posts, and defected to the people with a large amount of weapons.

In the area of An Xuyen-Dinh Tuong, in the first half of February, 3,915 soldiers defected from the enemy's ranks to the people's side. Among these defectors was a captain. In the area of Dinh Tuong, 446 personnel of the puppet regime defected from the enemy's ranks and stood on the side of the people.

The patriotic soldiers and personnel of the puppet regime who defected were warmly welcomed by the National Liberation Front and the people.

According to a report from the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, on March 5, the three companies of puppet soldiers stationed in the area of the Vam Co Dong River in the province of My Tho staged a simultaneous mutiny and defected to the people.

The report said that these three companies of puppet soldiers numbered more than 300. After eliminating the die-hard reactionaries, they brought their weapons and defected to the liberated areas.

Thus, from January 31 to March 5, more than 500 soldiers defected from the puppet army in the area of the Vam Co Dong River.
