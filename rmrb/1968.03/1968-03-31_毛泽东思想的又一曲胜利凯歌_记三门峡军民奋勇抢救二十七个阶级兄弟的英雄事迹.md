In our great motherland, the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are creating heroic feats every moment.

On January 22 this year, the military and civilians of Sanmenxia, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, bravely rescued 27 class brothers from Shijiaping Production Brigade of Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, who were in danger on the Yellow River. They added another glorious page to the brilliant epic of Mao Zedong Thought.

On January 22, the Sanmenxia Valley was howling with north winds, and the surging Yellow River was rolling with muddy waves and ice floes rushing downstream. The ice jam flood had arrived in the upper reaches of the Yellow River! The Sanmenxia Dam, which spans Henan and Shanxi provinces, opened six spillways, swallowing the yellow water and controlling the water levels upstream and downstream.

In this turbulent current, a small boat lost control, pushed forward by the waves and ice floes, getting closer and closer to the dam. At a point 500 meters from the dam, the water rapidly swirled into the spillways. If the boat reached here, it would be instantly crushed to pieces!

Originally, this boat was from the opposite shore of Sanmenxia City, Henan Province – Shijiaping Production Brigade of Sanmenxia Commune, Sanmenxia District, Pinglu County, Shanxi Province. The 27 members of the brigade responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." On the morning of January 22, they boarded the boat to cross the Yellow River to the opposite shore in Sanmenxia City, Henan Province, to transport livestock feed and prepare for the spring plowing. The small boat navigated through the ice floes, and when it reached the middle of the river, a large ice block about two mu in size suddenly rushed towards the boat. The boat could not avoid it and was hit, damaging the rudder. At this moment, the boat was out of control, and a huge ice block tightly pressed against it, drifting towards the Sanmenxia Dam. A boat-crushing, life-threatening incident was about to occur.

At this critical moment, Shijiaping Production Brigade leader Xi Xiaolai stood on the boat, leading everyone to loudly recite Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." This inspired everyone to fight against the ice and the rapids.

This voice, resounding like thunder, flew out over the river and spread in all directions.

"All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." Chairman Mao's great teachings shone brilliantly in people's minds.

On the north bank of the Yellow River, the cadres of Sanmenxia Commune, Sanmenxia District, Pinglu County, including Xi Man Dun, saw their class brothers in danger and immediately reported to the commune. Vice Chairman Jin Taizhong of the Sanmenxia Commune Revolutionary Committee immediately organized people to rescue them while reporting to the Pinglu County Revolutionary Committee. The Pinglu County Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "extreme responsibility to work and extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people," immediately formed a rescue command center and dispatched leaders to the scene to direct the rescue.

At the same time, on the Henan side, the poor peasants of Gaomiao Commune in Sanmenxia City, including Shi Sanxi and Shi Tie Mao, saw their class brothers in danger and immediately ran to the dam and the commune to report the situation.

The revolutionary soldiers and workers in the dam area, upon hearing the news, quickly opened the warehouse and moved out bamboo poles, wooden planks, ropes, and other rescue materials.

The People's Liberation Army's 8250th Unit also formed a 130-person rescue team and rushed to the dam. They said, "Rescue is to implement Chairman Mao's latest directive of 'supporting the army and loving the people.' We must spare no effort to rescue our class brothers."

Just as people were rushing to the Yellow River shore, the wooden boat continued to drift, getting closer and closer to the dam. At this time, the only emergency measure was to close the gates of the Sanmenxia Dam. However, the Sanmenxia Dam controls the water levels upstream and downstream of the Yellow River, and closing the gates requires approval from the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. What to do? The political instructor of the People's Liberation Army's 8239th Unit, Xu Jiangzhe, immediately discussed with the revolutionary soldiers at the dam head, based on the water situation upstream and downstream, and decided that closing a few spillways would not cause problems in a short time. Thus, they decisively adopted the gate-closing measure and simultaneously sent an urgent telegram to the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power.

After closing a few spillways, the water flow slowed, and the small boat stopped in the middle of the river, about 200 meters from the dam. However, the ice floes from upstream surrounded the small boat, tightening their grip. The small boat was in imminent danger of being crushed. The lives of the 27 class brothers were still in serious danger.

The wind blew harder, the sky was filled with dark clouds, and it started to snow heavily.

The news of the 27 class brothers in danger spread through telephone lines in all directions. Revolutionary workers, commune members, and revolutionary cadres from all over the Sanmenxia Dam area continued to rush to the rescue. The Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Shanxi Provincial Military Area Party Committee, as well as the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the Henan Provincial Military Area Party Committee, sent telegrams and made phone calls one after another, expressing concern for the class brothers in danger and instructing local military and civilians to do everything possible to complete the rescue mission.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda station at the dam head continuously broadcasted: "Class brothers in danger, Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, raise our courage.' With the great leader Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the People's Liberation Army that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, and the broad revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, you will definitely be rescued. Hold on, and victory is yours...." Comforting the class brothers in danger and inspiring the fighting spirit of the military and civilians participating in the rescue.

The 27 comrades on the boat were in high spirits, continuously shouting slogans, expressing their determination to fight against the wind and waves. The 55-year-old old poor peasant livestock feeder Chen Manxi stood at the bow of the boat and shouted to his fellow villagers: "Don't worry about us, remember to add grass for the calves!"

Time is life; every minute delayed increases the danger to the lives of the 27 class brothers.

Motorboats arrived, but due to the large ice floes and thick ice layers, they could not approach the small boat. Ropes were pulled from both shores for the class brothers in danger to grab and come ashore. However, due to the wide river, many ice blocks, heavy ropes, and great resistance, this method also failed.

It gradually got dark, and night fell, but the 27 class brothers had not been rescued. What to do?

"The masses are the real heroes." People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, bravest, and wisest. They can create any human miracle and overcome any great difficulty. Everyone brainstormed and decided: Use oil drums to make a raft, break the ice, and rescue.

As soon as the plan was announced, people from all directions took action.

Military and civilians braved the wind and snow, carrying bamboo poles, wooden planks, oil drums, and other materials along the mountain paths. The revolutionary workers at the dam head quickly set up searchlights, illuminating the rescue scene. Six crane operators who had just finished work ran through the flying snow and cold wind to bind the raft.

The raft was ready to be launched. A moving scene appeared on the Yellow River shore: The rescue assault team from the 8250th Unit of the People's Liberation Army wanted to board the raft; the soldiers from the 8239th Unit also wanted to board the raft; the revolutionary soldiers from the dam head ran to the raft, also wanting to board the raft. Everyone was eager to take on the heavy responsibility of the rescue. Thousands of red hearts had only one common vow: Like Ouyang Hai, Liu Yingjun, the heroic fourth platoon, and Comrade Li Wentong, to rescue class brothers, even if it means sacrificing one's own life, it is willingly accepted.

The temporary rescue command center, composed of military and civilians, decided that four people from the 8250th Unit, two from the 8239th Unit's 66th Team, five revolutionary soldiers from the dam head, and one boatworker from Pinglu would form a rescue assault team. Wang Nianyue would be the team leader.

Before setting off, the 12 rescue heroes, with unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, stood in a row on the shore, reciting Chairman Mao's teachings in unison:

"The military and the people are united as one, see who can defeat us?"

Night was dark, and snow was heavy. The raft, carrying the loyalty of the military and civilians on both shores of the Yellow River to Chairman Mao and their deep concern for their class brothers, broke through the waves and advanced!

Not far from the raft's launch, it was suddenly sucked into a whirlpool, spinning and swaying, unable to move forward. The people on the raft were in imminent danger of being thrown into the rapids. At this critical moment, Political Instructor Wang Nianyue stood calmly at the bow of the raft, loudly reciting: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." These 17 shining words gave the heroes unparalleled courage and strength. The 12 people united as one, pulling the raft out of the whirlpool.

The raft broke through the rapids not far, encountering a huge ice block blocking the way forward.

"This army has the spirit of advancing without fear of sacrifice, it will subdue all enemies and will never be subdued by the enemy." Chairman Mao's great teachings were battle commands. The heroes treated the ice block as an enemy, raising their arms, swinging their pickaxes and steel drills, declaring war on the ice. The ice was as hard as stone, and the pickaxes and steel drills struck the ice, causing their arms to ache. However, no matter how hard the ice was, it was no match for the revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought; no matter how firm the ice was, it could not shake the heroes' determination to rescue their class brothers. After two hours of fierce battle, the hard ice blocks were finally broken one by one, bowing down and making way for the heroes.

The raft advanced step by step, and when it was about 100 meters from the small boat, it was blocked by another group of ice blocks. What to do? Breaking the ice again, time was running out, and even if a channel was opened, the floating ice would quickly close up, and the raft would be in danger of being surrounded; the class brothers still could not be rescued.

Advance or retreat? "No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight." The 12 heroes said in unison: "We can only advance, not retreat. If we do not complete the mission, we will not return." Everyone decided to send one comrade to tread the ice and send the rope to the boat, rescuing the 27 class brothers in danger.

Treading on the floating ice blocks was fraught with danger, but the revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought feared no danger. Deputy Squad Leader Xu Yongfu of the 8250th Unit wanted to go, Five Good Soldier Hu Fulin of the 8239th Unit wanted to go, Revolutionary Soldier Li Chunming from the dam head wanted to go, and the boatworker from Pinglu also wanted to go. Political Instructor Wang Nianyue looked at everyone and finally fixed his gaze on Xu Yongfu. This staunch Communist and Five Good Soldier had already tied the rope around his waist, looked at the political instructor, and leaped off the raft.

Suddenly, a beam of light shot out from the dark river surface. Xu Yongfu, holding a flashlight, took resolute steps, treading on the floating ice and advancing.

The snow fell heavier, covering the floating ice blocks with a thick layer of white snow. Where was the undercurrent, where was the ice crack, where was the thin ice? Xu Yongfu could not tell. He relied on the faint light of the flashlight, feeling his way forward. Every step he took, the ice block made a creaking sound, and every step forward was a danger of falling into the ice. At this moment, our great leader Mao Zedong's teaching of "dying for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai" gave him endless courage. He forgot about his own safety and only thought about quickly rescuing the 27 class brothers on the small boat.

Suddenly, the light of the flashlight disappeared. Xu Yongfu fell into the water under the ice. Xu Yongfu fought with the rapids and the hard ice for a long time in the water, his arms and waist aching from exhaustion. Just at this moment, the loud voice of "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" rang in his ears. Chairman Mao's teachings inspired him. The heroic image of Li Wentong, who sacrificed himself to rescue the Red Guards, encouraged him. Suddenly, he felt full of strength, pushed his hands on the ice blocks, and leaped out of the ice crack.

The flashlight lit up again, and Xu Yongfu continued to advance. His cotton clothes and pants were soaked through with ice water, and quickly froze to his body in the cold wind, cold and piercing. He paid no attention to this and continued forward. The ice blocks were uneven and of different sizes. Xu Yongfu sometimes jumped over them, sometimes crawled forward. He had not walked 50 meters when he fell into the water under the ice again. At this dangerous and difficult moment, he seemed to see the great leader Chairman Mao waving his hand, urging him to advance. He gathered his strength again and broke free from the danger.

Xu Yongfu, disregarding his own safety, braved the rapids, explored the ice path, and finally boarded the small boat, tying the rope firmly to the mast, opening the way for the 27 class brothers in danger to escape. This path, every step of which shone with the light of Mao Zedong Thought. The 27 class brothers tightly grasped the rescue rope, tears streaming down their faces, and a thousand words condensed into one sentence:

"Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!"

At this time, Xu Yongfu, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "selflessly serving others" and "caring for others more than oneself," took care of the 27 class brothers to leave the danger first and was the last to leave the small boat.

The raft returned, and the 27 class brothers were rescued.

The east is red, the sun rises, and the golden sunlight shines on both shores of the Yellow River. The heroic deed of the military and civilians of Sanmenxia bravely rescuing their class brothers quickly spread to the surrounding areas, inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of millions of revolutionary masses for revolution and production. They decided to take the rescue heroes as examples, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, turn Mao Zedong Thought into their souls, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao in revolution.

    毛泽东思想的又一曲胜利凯歌
    ——记三门峡军民奋勇抢救二十七个阶级兄弟的英雄事迹
    在我们伟大的祖国，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，每时每刻都在创造着英雄业绩。
    今年一月二十二日，三门峡军民依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，英勇地抢救出山西省平陆县席家坪生产队二十七名在黄河上遇险的阶级兄弟，写下了又一页光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想的颂诗。
    一          
    一月二十二日这天，三门峡谷，北风呼啸，滔滔黄河，浊浪翻滚，排排冰凌，奔腾直下。黄河上游的凌汛来了！横跨河南、山西两省的三门峡拦河大坝，敞开六个溢流孔，吞吐着黄水，控制着上游的水位和下游的流量。
    在这湍急的激流中，一只小船，失去了控制，让浪涛冰凌推着前进，离大坝越来越近。在坝前五百米处，流水急速地漩入溢流孔。小船如果到达这里，瞬息就会粉身碎骨！
    原来，这只船是从河南省三门峡市的对岸——山西省平陆县三门公社三门大队席家坪生产队驶来的，船上有席家坪生产队的二十七名社员。他们响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，一月二十二日一早，乘船横渡黄河，到对岸的河南省三门峡市去运牲畜饲料，迎接春耕。小船在冰排中穿行，到了河心，突然一块约两亩大的冰块向小船冲来，小船躲避不及，被撞坏了船舵。这时，船已无法控制，巨大的冰块紧紧地抵住它向三门峡大坝飘去。一场船碎人亡的事件就要发生了。
    在这万分危急的关头，席家坪生产队队长席小来站在船上领着大家高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”鼓舞着大家与冰块、激流进行搏斗。
    这气壮山河的声音飞出河面，传向四面八方。
    二
    “一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”毛主席的伟大教导，在人们的头脑里闪耀着灿烂的光辉。
    在黄河北岸，平陆县三门公社三门大队的干部冀满囤看到阶级兄弟遇险，连忙给公社打电话汇报。三门公社革命委员会副主任靳太忠一面叫人向县革命委员会报告，一面立即组织人员抢救。平陆县革命委员会听到消息，遵照毛主席“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的教导，立即组成抢救指挥部，并派出领导干部奔赴现场指挥抢救。
    就在这同一时间，河南岸的三门峡市高庙公社贫农社员史三喜、史铁毛看见阶级兄弟遇险，立即奔跑到大坝和公社向人们报告险情。
    在坝区工作的无产阶级革命派战士和革命职工，闻讯之后迅速地打开仓库，搬出了杉杆、木板、绳索等抢救用的物资。
    人民解放军八二五○部队某部也组成了一支一百三十多人的抢险队伍，赶到大坝。他们说，抢险就是落实毛主席“拥军爱民”的最新指示，要不惜一切代价，抢救出阶级兄弟。
    正当人们赶向黄河岸边的时候，木船在继续向前飘着，离大坝越来越近。这时，唯一急救办法，就是关闭三门峡大坝的闸门。但是，三门峡大坝控制着黄河上游水位和下游流量，关闸必须经水利电力部批准。怎么办？守卫大坝的人民解放军八二三九部队指导员许江哲当即和坝头的无产阶级革命派战士研究，根据上下游水情，认为关闭几孔溢流孔，在短时间内不会发生问题。于是当机立断，决定采取关闸措施，同时向水利电力部急电报告。
    溢流孔关了几孔之后，水流慢了，小船停在距大坝二百多米的河心。但是，上游冲下来的浮冰围住了小船，越围越紧。小船随时都有被挤碎的危险。二十七个阶级兄弟的生命仍然受着严重的威胁。
    三
    风越刮越紧，乌云满天，下起了漫天大雪。
    二十七名阶级兄弟遇险的消息通过电话向四面八方传送着。三门峡大坝周围各地革命职工、公社社员、革命干部继续纷纷赶来抢救。山西省革命委员会和山西省军区党委、河南省革命委员会筹备小组和河南省军区党委也先后打来电报、电话，向遇险的阶级兄弟表示慰问，指示当地军民要尽一切办法完成抢救任务。
    坝头的毛泽东思想宣传站，不断地作着这样的广播：“遇险的阶级兄弟们，毛主席教导我们说：‘我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。’有伟大的领袖毛主席，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有无限忠于毛主席的人民解放军，有用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命群众，一定会把你们救出来，坚持下去，就是胜利……。”慰问着遇险的阶级兄弟，鼓舞着参加抢救工作的军民的斗志。
    船上的二十七名社员，斗志昂扬，不断高呼口号，表示与风浪作斗争的决心。五十五岁的老贫农饲养员陈满喜还屹立船头，向同村社员喊道：“不要光顾我们，记住给小牛添草哇！”
      时间就是生命，拖延一分钟就对二十七名阶级兄弟的生命安全多一分危险。
    机船驶来了，但因冰排过大，冰层过厚，无法接近小船。两岸拉起绳索，让遇险的阶级兄弟拉住绳子上岸。可是，由于河面宽，冰块多，绳子重，阻力大，这种办法也没有奏效。
    天渐渐暗下来，开始入夜了，二十七个阶级兄弟还没有救出。怎么办？
      “群众是真正的英雄”。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最聪明，最勇敢，最有智慧，什么人间奇迹都可以造出来，天大的困难也能够克服。大家出谋献策，决定：用汽油桶扎木筏，破冰抢救。
    一个办法传出去，四面八方齐行动。
    军民们顶着风雪，在山间小路上川流不息，扛来了杉杆、木板、油桶等物资。坝头的革命职工以最快的速度，安装起探照灯，照亮了抢救现场。刚刚下班的六名起重工，迎着飞雪寒风跑步赶来，动手绑扎木筏。
      筏子要下水了。黄河岸边出现了十分动人的情景：八二五○部队某部组成的抢险突击队要上筏；八二三九部队的战士们争着要上筏；坝头无产阶级革命派战士，跑到筏前，也争着要上筏，都争着挑起抢险的重担。千百颗红心只有一个共同的誓愿：象欧阳海、刘英俊、英雄四排和李文忠同志那样，为了抢救阶级兄弟，就是牺牲个人生命，也心甘情愿。
      由军民共同组成的临时抢救指挥部研究决定，由八二五○部队某部指导员汪年跃等四人，八二三九部队六六分队两人，大坝无产阶级革命派战士五人，平
  陆船工一人，组成一支抢险突击队。汪年跃担任队长。
      出发前，十二名抢险勇士，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，雄赳赳地列队岸边，齐声朗诵毛主席的教导：
    “军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”
    夜沉沉，雪漫漫。木筏满载着黄河两岸军民对毛主席的赤胆忠心，对阶级兄弟的深切关怀，破浪前进了！
    木筏下水不远，突然被卷进漩涡，打起转转，左右摇晃，不能前进，木筏上的人随时有翻下激流的危险。在这危急的时刻，指导员汪年跃，沉着镇静，昂立筏头，高声朗诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这十七个闪闪发光的大字，给勇士们增添了无比的勇气和力量。十二个人拧成一股劲，把木筏划出了漩涡。
    木筏冲过激流不远，又遇到巨大的冰块，挡住前进的航道。
    “这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”毛主席的伟大教导就是战斗命令。勇士们把冰块当作敌人，奋起双臂，抡起铁镐、钢钎，向冰宣战。冰块象石头一样坚硬，铁镐、钢钎打在冰上，震得手臂酸痛。但是，冰再硬，也硬不过用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士；冰再坚，也动摇不了勇士们抢救阶级兄弟的决心。经过两个小时的激战，坚硬的冰块终于一块块地被敲碎，在勇士们面前低头让路。
    木筏一步步前进，当距离小船还有一百来米的时候，又被冰群挡住了。怎么办？再破冰，时间不等人，即使是开辟出一条航道，浮冰还会很快地合拢，木筏也有被围住的危险；阶级兄弟还是救不出来。
    前进，还是后退？“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”十二名勇士异口同声地说：“我们只能前进，不能后退，完不成任务，决不返航。”大家决定，派一个同志踩冰探路，把绳子送到船上，救出二十七名遇险的阶级兄弟。
    在浮动的冰排群上探路，随时都有掉进水里的危险。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，谁畏艰险？八二五○部队副班长徐永福要去，八二三九部队五好战士胡福林要去，大坝无产阶级革命派战士李春明要去，平陆的船工也要去。指导员汪年跃看了看大家，最后把目光落在徐永福身上。这个坚强的共产党员、五好战士，早已把绳子拴在腰上，望了一眼指导员，纵身跳下了木筏。
    从黑暗的河面上，蓦地射出一道亮光。徐永福拿着手电筒，迈开刚毅的步伐，踏着浮冰前进了。
    雪越下越大，浮动的冰排上铺盖了一层厚厚的白雪。那里是暗流，那里是冰缝，那里是薄冰，徐永福无法辨认，他凭着手电筒的微弱亮光，摸索着前进。脚踩下去，冰排发出咯吱咯吱的响声，每前进一步，都有坠入冰下的危险。这时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席的“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的伟大教导，给他增加了无穷的勇气，他忘掉了个人的一切，只想赶快救出小船上的那二十七个阶级兄弟。
    陡然间，手电筒的光亮不见了。徐永福掉到了冰下水中。徐永福在水里与激流、坚冰进行了长时间的战斗，累得臂痛腰酸。正在这个时候，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的洪亮的声音，在他耳边响起。毛主席的教导，激励着他。李文忠舍身抢救红卫兵的英雄形象，鼓舞着他。顿时，他感到浑身都是力量，双手按在冰块上，往上一纵，跳出了冰缝。
    手电筒亮了，徐永福又继续前进。他的棉衣、棉裤全被冰水湿透了，经冷风一吹，很快结成了冰，贴在身上，冰冷刺骨。他没有理会这些，继续向前。冰块高低不平，大小不一。徐永福有时跳跃而过，有时匍匐前进，没走出五十米的距离，又掉到了冰下水中。在这艰险困难的时刻，他仿佛看到伟大领袖毛主席在挥手，让他前进。他再次鼓足了力量，摆脱了危险。
    徐永福不顾个人安危，闯激流，探冰路，终于踏上小船，把绳子牢牢地拴在桅杆上，为遇险的二十七名阶级兄弟开出了脱险的道路。这条路，每一步都闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。二十七名阶级弟兄紧握救生绳，满脸热泪，千言万语汇成一句话：
    “毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    这时，徐永福又按照毛主席的“毫不利己专门利人”、“关心他人比关心自己为重”的伟大教导，照顾着二十七名阶级兄弟先离开险境，自己最后一个离开了小船。
    木筏返航了。二十七个阶级兄弟脱险了。
    四
    东方红，太阳升，金色的阳光照耀着黄河两岸。三门峡军民奋勇抢救阶级兄弟的英雄事迹，迅速传遍周围各地，鼓舞着千百万革命群众的革命、生产的热情。他们决心以抢险英雄为榜样，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想化为灵魂，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，永远跟着伟大领袖毛主席干革命。
