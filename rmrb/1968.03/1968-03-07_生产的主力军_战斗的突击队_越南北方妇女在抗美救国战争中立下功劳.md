Women fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle in North Vietnam have responded to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms, bravely enduring hardships and sacrifices, and achieving outstanding results in production and battle. They have made tremendous contributions to the anti-American national salvation war.

In 1965, the "three assurances" movement among women in North Vietnam spread from cities to rural areas, from plains to mountainous regions. With the fighting spirit of "determined to defeat the American aggressors," women joyfully sent their loved ones to the front lines, bravely took on men's work, and did everything possible to complete their tasks. Currently, women in North Vietnam are not only the main force in production but also a crucial force in battle.

In the past year, women in North Vietnam, especially in agricultural production, have played an even greater role. Despite the destruction caused by American aggressor planes, rural women have persevered in production and achieved bumper harvests. For example, the production brigade led by female brigade leader Phan Thi Qua in the Me Xa Agricultural Cooperative in the Thuong Xa Commune of Hai Hung Province is a key area targeted by enemy bombing. She organized women to evacuate children to safe places, while continuing to work, overcoming severe drought and cold, and achieving a bumper harvest. This brigade became the highest-yielding unit in North Vietnam in terms of per-unit area yield. The female director of the Thuan Chau Commune in the Thuan Thanh District of Ninh Binh Province led the cooperative to achieve a bumper harvest. Women in agricultural cooperatives across Thai Binh Province formed 10,000 planting teams named after the southern heroine Nguyen Thi Du, completing the winter-spring planting tasks on time. Women across North Vietnam have raised the slogan in production: "Fight to the death to complete production tasks, support our southern compatriots, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors."

In the past year, women in North Vietnam not only actively participated in production but also bravely joined the self-defense militia, voluntarily served in battles, and directly participated in combat, becoming an important force in the anti-American national salvation war. Whether on the self-defense militia positions, high-altitude artillery positions, roadside battle fortifications, or coastal artillery positions, there are always female militia members. They have established great merits for the motherland in battle. In the 1967 model workers' conference across North Vietnam, 17 female soldiers were named heroes, the 9th Assault Battalion (female) was named a heroic unit, and 8 female militia units were awarded the title of "decisive units." In Nghe An Province, more than 4,700 militia members were awarded the "three good" title, with more than half being women. Female militia members not only fight alongside male militia members or anti-aircraft artillery but also can fight independently and achieve victories. It is reported that in 1967, 11 female militia units shot down a total of 12 enemy planes. The female militia company in Thua Thien Province was the first unit to shoot down an American aggressor plane, and then female militia members across the country launched a competition to strike down American planes, achieving great victories.

Female militia members in coastal areas are heroic coastal artillery troops. They bravely defend the motherland's territorial waters and fiercely strike invading American pirates. A female militia battalion in a commune in Nghe An Province once damaged an American destroyer, and another female militia member, Vo Thi Nga's artillery squad, repelled two enemy speedboats, protecting fishermen working at sea. In addition, female militia members have made outstanding contributions in repairing roads, ferries, and other work. They overcame various difficulties, fearlessly sacrificed, and ensured the smooth flow of traffic. The 9th Female Youth Shock Brigade had 100 female members responsible for setting up two floating bridges, which were bombed by enemy planes more than 50 times, but still completed the task on time.

In the fierce battle environment, women in North Vietnam have withstood severe tests, becoming even more resolute and brave, and are truly heroic women of a heroic nation.

    生产的主力军　战斗的突击队
    越南北方妇女在抗美救国战争中立下功劳
    据新华社河内六日电　本社记者报道：战斗在抗美斗争前线的越南北方妇女，响应胡志明主席的战斗号召，不畏艰苦牺牲，在生产、战斗中取得了出色的成绩，为抗美救国战争作出了巨大的贡献。
    一九六五年在越南北方妇女中展开的“三承担”运动，已经从城市发展到乡村、从平原发展到山区。广大妇女怀着“决心战胜美国侵略强盗”的战斗豪情，愉快地送自己的亲人去参军杀敌，勇敢地承担起男人的工作，千方百计地完成任务。目前，越南北方妇女既是生产的主力军，又是战斗的重要力量。
    在过去的一年中，越南北方广大妇女在生产中特别是农业生产中，发挥了更加巨大的作用。广大农村妇女在美国强盗飞机的轰炸破坏下坚持生产，获得了丰收。例如，海阳省四圻县美舍农业社的一个生产队是敌机轰炸的一个重点地区，生产队女队长范氏居组织妇女把儿童疏散到安全地方去，她们继续留下生产，战胜了严重的干旱和寒冷，取得了丰收，成为越南北方单位面积产量最高的一个生产队。永福省永祥县尊正乡上村合作社主任是位妇女，领导合作社夺得了丰收。太平省各地农业社妇女组成了一万个以南方女英雄阮氏坞命名的插秧组，及时完成了冬春插秧任务。北方广大妇女在生产中提出响亮的口号：“誓死完成生产任务，支援南方同胞，彻底战胜美国侵略者”。
    越南北方妇女在过去一年中不但积极生产，还勇敢地参加民兵自卫队，自觉地为战斗服务和直接参加战斗，成为抗美救国战争中的一支重要力量。无论是在民兵自卫队阵地上，还是在高炮阵地上，也无论是在公路旁的战斗工事里，还是在沿海炮兵阵地旁，都有女民兵自卫队员。她们在战斗中，为祖国建立了巨大的功勋。在一九六七年全北方劳模大会上，十七位女战士被评为英雄，突击队第九连（女）被评为英雄单位，八个女民兵单位荣获“决胜单位”称号。广平省有四千七百多名民兵获得“三好”称号，其中一大半是妇女。女民兵自卫队员不仅同男民兵自卫队员或高射炮兵一起战斗，而且自己也能独立作战，并取得胜利。据报道，一九六七年有十一个女民兵自卫队单位击落了敌机共十二架。清化省厚禄县女民兵中队是第一个击落美国强盗飞机的女民兵单位，接着各地女民兵展开打击美机的竞赛，取得很大胜利。
    沿海地区的女民兵是英雄的海岸炮兵，她们英勇保卫祖国的领海，狠狠打击入侵的美国海盗。广平省一个乡的女民兵大队海岸炮兵曾击伤美国驱逐舰一艘，另一个乡的女民兵武氏娥炮兵班击退敌人二艘别动艇，保卫了在海上作业的渔民。此外，女民兵自卫队员在抢修公路、渡口等工作中也作出了出色的贡献。她们克服各种困难，不怕流血牺牲，保证了公路畅通无阻。女青年突击队第九连有一百名女队员，负责架设两座浮桥，曾遭到敌机轰炸五十多次，但仍然按期完成了任务。
    在激烈的战斗环境中，越南北方妇女经受住了严峻的考验，锻炼得更加坚强勇敢，不愧为英雄的民族的英雄妇女。
