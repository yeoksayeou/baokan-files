Ah Li is a brave female guerrilla fighter and an outstanding guerrilla warfare commander in the western region of Thừa Thiên Province. She is a model soldier of the Liberation Armed Forces in the Central Region and has been awarded two Liberation Merit Medals, one of which recognizes her achievements in commanding the siege of the A Lưới outpost.

The A Lưới outpost is located in the middle of a basin. The enemy inside frequently comes out to harass, burn down the homes of the villagers, and massacre the people. All of this has filled Ah Li and the villagers with immense anger, and they have resolved to severely punish the rampaging enemy.

One day, Ah Li and her comrades infiltrated near the enemy's bunker, hiding all day beside rows of hedges and barbed wire, watching the enemy. Seeing the enemy emerge from their fortifications, some comrades wanted to fire, but Ah Li restrained them, saying, "If we shoot now, we can only kill one or two enemies. We should wait until the enemies come out in groups, then we can annihilate more of them."

As the sun began to set, a group of enemies came out and gathered on the outpost's parade ground. Ah Li saw clearly that there were two individuals wearing red hats, unusually tall, and she thought to herself, "This time we've encountered Americans." The comrades' hands were itching to pull the triggers, but Ah Li still did not allow them to fire. She first assigned tasks, having two comrades specifically target the Americans, while she and the other comrades used grenades to eliminate the puppet soldiers.

The enemies were busy eating and drinking, arguing loudly, when suddenly, dozens of grenades flew over the hedges and landed right among the enemy, exploding one after another.

The enemies, frightened, rushed back into the bunkers, hiding in the fortifications and not daring to show their heads, like a group of pigs trapped in a pen.

Ah Li's guerrilla unit decided to eliminate the bunker in front of the airstrip. Before the sun rose, Ah Li and her comrades were already in ambush there. The enemy's patrol team, half asleep and stumbling, walked over for patrol. Ah Li calmly assigned tasks to each comrade before ordering the attack. The moment the shots rang out, eight enemies were hit and fell to the ground, lying in all directions.

After this battle, the enemies stationed at the airstrip were in great panic. One day, a large group of enemies went out on patrol and, upon returning, saw that leaflets were scattered inside the bunker. They hurriedly abandoned the airstrip and fled back to the A Lưới outpost in a panic.

Ah Li's guerrilla unit gradually tightened the encirclement around the A Lưới outpost. The villagers helped the guerrillas sharpen stakes and, together with the guerrilla fighters, set up clever traps around the outpost. Countless sharp stakes, countless traps, a series of accurate grenades, and repeated brave, surprise ambushes caused the enemies in the A Lưới outpost to suffer heavy casualties, with many killed and wounded.

In this way, the A Lưới outpost was finally destroyed in the guerrilla warfare blazing in the western region of Thừa Thiên Province.

    战斗中的越南南方妇女
    勇敢顽强的女战士—阿历
    阿历是个勇敢的女游击队员，又是承天省西部地区一位出色的游击战指挥员。她是中部中区解放武装力量的模范战士，曾获得两枚解放战功勋章，其中一枚是表彰她在指挥围攻亚累据点的功绩。
    亚累据点设在盆地中间。据点里的敌人经常出来骚扰，烧毁老乡们的家园，屠杀人民。这一切引起了阿历和乡亲们的无比愤怒，他们决心严惩胡作非为的敌人。
    有一天，阿历和同志们深入敌人碉堡附近，整天埋伏在一排排篱笆和铁丝网旁边监视敌人。看见敌人冒出工事，有的同志很想射击，阿历劝阻道：“现在打，只能打死一两个敌人，等敌人集中出来时打，才能歼灭更多的敌人。”
    太阳快下山了，一群敌人出来，集中在据点的操场上。阿历看得非常清楚，有两个戴红帽子的，个子高得出奇，阿历满心欢喜，心想这下可遇上美国佬了。同志们的手在发痒，都想扳动枪机，阿历还是不让开枪，她先分好工，让两个同志专打美国佬，她和其他同志用手榴弹消灭伪军。
    敌人正在吵吵嚷嚷大吃大喝，突然，几十颗手榴弹从一排排篱笆那边飞过来，正好投中敌群，一个接一个地炸开了。
    敌人吓得赶忙往碉堡里跑，躲在工事里不敢露出头来，活象一群猪被圈在猪圈里。
    阿历的游击组决定要拔除在飞机场前面的碉堡。在太阳还没升起的时候，阿历和同志们已埋伏在那里，敌人的巡逻队半睡半醒、跌跌撞撞地走过来巡逻，阿历沉着地向每一个同志交代任务后才下令开枪。枪声一响，八个敌人没来得及散开就被打中了，横七竖八地倒在地上。
    这场战斗后，驻在飞机场的敌人十分恐慌。有一天敌人成队出去巡逻，回来时，看见碉堡里撒满传单，他们慌忙丢下机场，一溜烟跑回亚累据点。
    阿历指挥的游击队越来越缩紧对亚累据点的包围圈。乡亲们帮着游击队削尖桩，并且同游击队员一起在据点周围设置巧妙的陷阱。无数锋利的尖桩，无数陷阱，一串串非常准确的手榴弹，一次次勇敢的、出其不意的伏击战，使得亚累据点的敌人死的死、伤的伤。
    就这样，亚累据点最后在承天西部地区军民的游击战争的烈火中被烧毁了。
