Hearts Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao
—Congratulations on the Successful Opening of the Second Session of the Engineering Corps' Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works Conference

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Revolutionary soldiers are forever loyal to you. Whatever you say, we will do. We fight and work to defend you! We will always listen to you and serve the people wholeheartedly. We will resolutely carry out your latest instructions and create new achievements for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The picture shows representatives from a certain unit at the conference, expressing their deep class feelings for Chairman Mao by standing before his portrait.

A red flag flying in the snowy highlands—the 10th Company of a certain unit in the Engineering Corps has been studying and applying Chairman Mao's works diligently, carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle. For 18 years, they have made significant contributions to national defense construction and have been rated as a "Four Good" company for seven consecutive years, earning the honorable title of "Model 'Four Good' Company" in the Engineering Corps. This is the 10th Company's soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works in the snowy highlands.

Head can be cut off, blood can be shed, but the resolve to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line cannot be abandoned; the sea can dry up, and rocks can crumble, but the red heart loyal to Chairman Mao will never change. The 1st Company of a certain unit in the Engineering Corps has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and resisted the counter-revolutionary revisionist wind of "military exercises" stirred up by Luo Ruiqing. They have made important contributions to national defense construction and have been rated as a "Four Good" company for seven consecutive years. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have criticized and denounced China's Khrushchev. This is the 1st Company's soldiers conducting a big criticism.

Revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless, brave, and intelligent. They can climb any peak and create any miracle. Wang Huanrong, a worker from a certain unit in the Engineering Corps, has studied and applied Chairman Mao's works diligently, shown great perseverance in construction, and achieved outstanding results, earning a second-class merit citation. This is Wang Huanrong with his comrades studying Chairman Mao's works.

The latest instructions are in our hearts, supporting the left and loving the people to write new chapters. Former volunteer soldier and explosion hero, now deputy battalion commander of a certain unit in the Engineering Corps, Zheng Dingfu, made great contributions in the anti-American aid Korea war; in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he has created new achievements for the people. This is Zheng Dingfu on the front line of "three supports, two militaries," discussing with the revolutionary masses his experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The red sun shines bright, its rays reaching the hearts of the families. The second family unit of the rear service of a certain unit in the Engineering Corps, following the great leader Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive, studies politics, military affairs, and culture, and engages in agricultural and sideline production. They are determined to turn the family unit into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought. This is them engaged in agricultural labor.

Among thousands of reds, the soldiers' loyalty to Chairman Mao is the reddest; among thousands of loyalties, resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the greatest loyalty. The military training team of a certain unit in the Engineering Corps stationed at Beijing Yuegezhuang Middle School has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, done meticulous ideological and political work, greatly promoted the thought revolution of teachers and students, helped revolutionary youngsters return to class and make revolution, and achieved remarkable results. The picture shows the military training team's comrades and revolutionary youngsters studying Chairman Mao's works together.

With a heart full of loyalty, grasping the use of it, and establishing great public spirit. The proletarian revolutionary faction of the direct-affiliated organs of the Engineering Corps, in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, has closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, seriously carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. This is them holding a class meeting in the Mao Zedong Thought study class.

    红心永向毛主席
    ——祝贺工程兵第二届学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会胜利召开
    毛主席啊，毛主席！革命战士永远忠于您。您老人家怎么说，我们就怎么做。我们为保卫您而战斗，为保卫您而施工！我们永远听您老人家的话，全心全意地为人民服务。我们坚决贯彻执行您的最新指示，在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立新功。图为出席大会的某部代表，怀着对毛主席无比深厚的阶级感情，来到毛主席像前，敬表战士们的一片忠心。
    飘扬在风雪高原上的一面红旗——工程兵某部十连，活学活用毛主席著作，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命传统，十八年如一日，为国防建设作出了重大贡献，连续七年被评为四好连队，并荣获工程兵“四好连队标兵”的光荣称号。这是十连的战士在风雪高原上认真学习毛主席著作。
    头可断，血可流，保卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的决心不可丢；海可枯，石可烂，忠于毛主席的红心永不变。工程兵某部一连，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，顶住了反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿刮起的“大比武”妖风。他们在国防建设中作出了重要贡献，连续七年被评为四好连队。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们口诛笔伐，万炮齐轰中国赫鲁晓夫。这是一连的战士们在进行大批判。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，最无畏、最勇敢、最聪明，什么高峰都可以攀登，什么人间奇迹都可以创造。工程兵某部职工王焕荣同志活学活用毛主席著作，在施工中英勇顽强，取得了卓越的成绩，荣立二等功。这是王焕荣同志和战友们一起学习毛主席著作。
    最新指示记心间，支左爱民写新篇。前中国人民志愿军爆破英雄、现工程兵某部副营长郑定富同志，在当年抗美援朝战争中立下了战功；在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，又为人民立下了新功。这是郑定富同志在“三支”“两军”第一线，和革命群众一起交谈活学活用毛主席最新指示的体会。
    太阳红，太阳亮，红太阳的光芒照到家属心坎上。工程兵某部留守处第二家属队，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的“五·七”指示，学政治、学军事、学文化，从事农副业生产。她们决心把家属队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。这是她们在从事农业劳动。
    千红万红，战士忠于毛主席的心最红；千忠万忠，坚决执行毛主席最新指示是最大的忠。工程兵某部驻北京岳各庄中学军训团，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，做艰苦细致的思想政治工作，大大地促进了师生的思想革命化，帮助革命小将复课闹革命，取得了显著的成绩。图为军训团的同志和革命小将一起学习毛主席著作。
    心怀一个“忠”字，狠抓一个“用”字，大立一个“公”字。工程兵直属机关无产阶级革命派，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，认真执行毛主席的最新指示，大办毛泽东思想学习班。这是他们正在毛泽东思想学习班里开讲用会。
