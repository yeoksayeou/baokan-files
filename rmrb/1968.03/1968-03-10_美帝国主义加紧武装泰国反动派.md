The U.S. imperialists are intensifying the armament of the Thai reactionaries, attempting to further assist the Thanom clique in suppressing the burgeoning armed struggle of the Thai people. On February 29, the deputy defense minister and chief of staff of the Thai puppet government, Thawit Juntaraksa, revealed at a press conference that the U.S. imperialists will provide the Thanom clique with $250 million this year to construct strategic roads, airports, and military ports in Thailand. The U.S. has decided to provide the Thanom clique with $60 million in "special aid" to suppress the burgeoning armed struggle in northeastern Thailand. According to Thawit, the annual military aid the U.S. provides to Thailand will also increase from $40 million two years ago to $75 million this year. It is reported that 30 police patrol cars provided by the U.S. for suppressing the people's armed struggle have already been handed over to the Thanom clique at the end of January. The U.S. will also supply the Thanom clique with 50 helicopters this year. To bolster the confidence of the Thanom clique, the U.S. has also agreed to equip the Thai reactionary army with an "anti-aircraft missile battery." (According to Xinhua News Agency)
