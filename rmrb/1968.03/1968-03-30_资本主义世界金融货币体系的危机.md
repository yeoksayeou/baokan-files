The capitalist world's financial monetary system is experiencing a crisis. The imperialist bloc led by the United States is facing the most severe financial crisis in forty years. The capitalist world monetary system centered around the dollar has begun to collapse.

The U.S. Empire Utilizes Dollar Hegemony for External Expansion

After World War II, relying on its financial and economic advantages in the capitalist world, the United States established a capitalist world monetary system centered around the dollar.

In the 1930s, after the capitalist world experienced the Great Depression, the gold standard for various countries' currencies collapsed, and many countries' currencies were decoupled from gold. After the war, the United States controlled more than half of the world's gold reserves. It then, through the International Monetary Fund it orchestrated, set the exchange rates of various countries' currencies to be fixed to the dollar, with only the dollar maintaining a link to gold. At the same time, it stipulated that the exchange rates between various countries' currencies should remain fixed and not be arbitrarily changed. Additionally, the International Monetary Fund recognized the gold price unilaterally set by the United States, and without U.S. approval, gold prices could not be adjusted in practice. This formed the capitalist world monetary system centered around the dollar. In addition to using the dollar as an international settlement tool and payment method, capitalist countries also used the dollar along with gold as their currency reserves. Thus, the dollar became the primary international reserve currency in the capitalist world.

The capitalist world international monetary system centered around the dollar is an important tool for U.S. imperialist expansion.

First, the fixed exchange rates between various countries' currencies and the dollar facilitate the export of U.S. goods and capital.

Second, since the dollar became the international reserve currency, the United States can directly use dollars for foreign payments. Other countries hold dollars as reserves, allowing the United States to arbitrarily print dollars to provide "aid" to other countries, pay for overseas military expenses, invest overseas, and intensify economic plunder and political control of other countries.

Third, U.S. inflation causes the purchasing power of the dollar to continuously decline, but the gold price set by the United States remains unchanged, effectively suppressing the price of gold. In the early post-war period, Western European countries, due to war destruction and economic difficulties, urgently needed material supplies. The United States took the opportunity to dump large quantities of goods. As a result, Western European countries generally experienced severe "dollar shortages." In the situation where Western European countries urgently needed dollars, the United States took the opportunity to buy large quantities of gold from various countries at low prices. On the other hand, when other countries had surpluses in their international balance of payments and held dollar funds, they suffered invisible losses due to the continuous decline in the actual purchasing power of the dollar.

Fourth, foreigners holding dollar reserves, apart from a small portion being dollar cash, most are deposits in U.S. banks or purchases of U.S. short-term bonds. These are all U.S. short-term debts. The United States is in a debtor position. However, because the funds are in the United States, the U.S. monopoly capitalist group can use these funds to invest or lend abroad, controlling the economies of other countries.

The Dollar Faces Insurmountable Contradictions

Due to the development of revolutionary struggles by the people of various countries and the intensification of various contradictions within the imperialist system, the dollar, as the "backbone" of the capitalist world monetary system, has fallen into an inescapable crisis.

First, U.S. imperialism, in order to suppress revolutionary movements in various countries, implements aggressive and war policies, resulting in enormous military expenditures, increasing fiscal deficits, and worsening inflation, causing the purchasing power of the dollar to continuously decline and fundamentally shaking the credit of the dollar.

Second, U.S. imperialism, utilizing the privileged position of the dollar, prints dollars indiscriminately to fund its external aggression and expansion, resulting in a significant increase in overseas expenditures and a large amount of dollars falling into foreign hands, forming a massive international balance of payments deficit. In recent years, as the Vietnam War escalates, overseas military spending has surged, further widening the international balance of payments deficit. Foreigners' holdings of dollar reserves continue to rise, while U.S. gold reserves are increasingly depleted. The former is already more than three times the latter, and the U.S. gold reserves are far from enough to cover its short-term foreign debts, causing the credit of the dollar to decline.

Third, led by France, Western European countries, in order to oppose U.S. control and compete with the United States for hegemony, use various opportunities to strike at the credit of the dollar. The contradictions and competition between France and the United States in the monetary sphere are becoming increasingly intense. Since 1965, the French government has not only taken the lead in exchanging dollars for gold with the United States but also used opportunities to stir up gold market speculation, triggering a gold-buying frenzy and striking at the position of the dollar. At the same time, the capitalist world monetary system centered around the dollar puts countries like France in a disadvantageous position in the competition for markets, investment venues, and spheres of influence. Therefore, France strongly demands the reform of the current capitalist world monetary system and, in terms of how to reform, continually pressures the United States, insisting on not giving in.

Since the 1960s, in order to cope with the dollar crisis, the United States has taken some patchwork measures, such as establishing the "Gold Pool," creating reciprocal credit, and expanding the lending capacity of the International Monetary Fund, but these have not solved the fundamental problems of the dollar.

The Capitalist World Monetary System on the Brink of Collapse

The severe financial crisis that swept the capitalist world in February and March, triggered by the gold-buying frenzy, is an important sign of the collapse of the dollar and the capitalist world monetary system centered around the dollar. On March 16, the United States, together with several major capitalist countries, met in Washington to discuss countermeasures and was forced to announce that it would no longer maintain the official price of gold at $35 per ounce in the open market. This indicates that it has reached a dead end in maintaining the official gold price. Without maintaining the open market, the price of gold will inevitably rise. The rise in the international market price of gold is equivalent to the dollar not being able to maintain its fixed official price against gold, which is the devaluation of the dollar. The U.S. official gold price is an important pillar of the post-war capitalist world monetary system, and this pillar is now beginning to collapse.

The Johnson administration is now desperately trying to maintain the current fixed exchange rate system based on the dollar. To maintain the fixed exchange rate relationships between various countries' currencies, the dollar's parity must first be stabilized. The emergency measures currently taken by the United States are: (1) Continuing to require central banks of various countries not to exchange dollars for gold. (2) To cope with the speculative wave in the foreign exchange market, the United States has expanded reciprocal credit with various countries from more than $7 billion to $9.3 billion. (3) Implementing domestic austerity measures, increasing taxes, reducing civilian spending, and shifting the crisis onto the working people.

However, these measures are not only difficult to implement but will also inevitably exacerbate the contradictions within and outside the United States, thus only pushing the United States into a more severe economic and political crisis.

The fundamental cause of the dollar crisis is the inflation and international balance of payments deficit caused by the U.S. policy of aggression and war. As long as the basic contradictions are not resolved, relying on some patchwork measures will, of course, be of no avail. Moreover, the contradictions between France and the United States in the monetary sphere have recently developed further. The meeting of the finance ministers of the ten Western countries that began in Stockholm on March 29 has become the focus of attention for capitalist countries because the imperialist countries, especially France and the United States, are going to have a major showdown on the reform of the current capitalist world monetary system. If the exchange rate relationships between capitalist countries based on the dollar standard collapse, the current exchange rate relationships will be disrupted, resulting in the complete disintegration of the capitalist world monetary system. Once the exchange rate relationships between various countries fall into chaos, trade between countries, capital movements, and other economic activities based on the current exchange rate relationships will all fall into a state of turmoil and chaos.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The era we are in is the era of the complete collapse of the imperialist system, and the imperialists have fallen into an insoluble crisis." The development of the capitalist world financial crisis centered around the dollar crisis will accelerate the comprehensive collapse of the imperialist system.

### 资本主义世界金融货币体系的危机

    资本主义世界金融货币体系的危机
    以美国为首的帝国主义集团，正经历着一场四十年来最严重的金融危机。以美元为中心的资本主义世界货币体系已经开始崩溃。
    美帝利用美元霸权地位对外扩张
    第二次世界大战后，美国依仗它在资本主义世界所拥有的金融经济优势，建立了以美元为中心的资本主义世界货币体系。
    三十年代资本主义世界在经济大危机之后，各国货币的金本位制崩溃了，许多国家的货币都同黄金割断了联系。战后，美国掌握了资本主义世界黄金储备的一半以上，它就通过它一手策划成立的“国际货币基金组织”，规定各国货币的平价固定在美元上，只有美元才同黄金保持联系；同时，还规定各国货币相互之间保持固定汇率，不能随意改变。此外，“国际货币基金组织”还确认了美国单方面规定的黄金价格，没有美国同意，实际上就不能对金价进行变动。这就形成了以美元为中心的资本主义世界货币体系。资本主义各国除了使用美元作为国际结算工具和国际支付手段外，还把美元同黄金一起，作为本国的货币储备。于是美元成为资本主义世界主要国际储备货币。
    以美元为中心的资本主义国际货币体系，是美帝国主义对外扩张的重要工具。
    第一，各国货币同美元保持固定汇率，这就有利于美国商品输出和资本输出的进行。
    第二，由于美元成为国际储备货币，美国就可以直接用美元办理对外支付，其他国家把美元作为储备，它可以任意滥发美钞，以提供对其他国家的“援助”，支付海外军事开支，进行海外投资，加紧对其他国家的经济掠夺和政治控制。
    第三，美国通货膨胀造成美元购买力不断下降，但美国规定的黄金价格却一直不变，实际上就是故意压低黄金的价格。战后初期西欧国家因为战争破坏，经济困难，迫切需要物资供应，美国就乘机大量倾销商品。结果使西欧各国普遍出现严重的“美元荒”。在西欧各国都迫切要求取得美元的情况下，美国乘机按低价搜刮各国的大量黄金。另一方面，当其他国家国际收支有盈余，持有美元资金时，又因美元实际购买力不断下降而遭受无形损失。
    第四，外国人持有美元储备，除了一小部分是美元现钞外，大部分是存在美国银行的存款或购买美国短期债券。这些都是美国欠人家的短期负债，美国处于债务人地位。但是因为资金存在美国，美国垄断资本集团又得以利用这些资金来对外投资或贷款，控制别国的经济。
    美元面对无法克服的矛盾
    由于各国人民革命斗争的发展和帝国主义制度各种矛盾的加剧，作为资本主义世界货币体系的“脊椎骨”的美元，陷入了不可解脱的危机。
    第一，美帝国主义为了镇压各国人民革命运动，推行侵略和战争政策，弄得军费开支庞大，财政赤字激增，通货膨胀日益发展，美元购买力不断下降，从根本上动摇了美元的信用。
    第二，美帝国主义利用美元特权地位，滥发美元，资助它的对外侵略和扩张，结果海外开支大大增加，大量美元落到外国人手里，形成了庞大的国际收支逆差。最近几年，侵越战争不断“升级”，海外军费大幅度上升，更加扩大了国际收支逆差。外国人持有的美元储备不断上升，而美国的黄金储备却日益枯竭，前者已经等于后者的三倍多，美国的黄金远远不足以弥补它的对外短期负债，美元信用日益低落。
    第三，以法国为代表的西欧各国为了反对美国控制，同美国争夺霸权，利用各种时机打击美元的信用。法、美在货币领域内的矛盾和竞争日趋激烈。一九六五年以来，法国政府不但带头用手头的美元向美国兑换黄金，而且利用时机在黄金市场上煽风点火，掀起抢购黄金风潮，打击美元地位。同时，以美元为中心的资本主义世界货币体系，使法国等主要西欧国家在争夺市场、投资场所和势力范围的竞争中处于不利地位。因此，法国强烈要求改革现行资本主义世界货币体系，并在如何改革方面，对美国处处进逼，坚持不让。
    六十年代以来，美国为了应付美元危机四伏的局面，采取了一些修修补补的措施，例如成立“黄金总库”、建立互惠信贷、扩大“国际货币基金组织”贷款能力等，但是都解决不了美元的根本问题。
    资本主义世界货币体系濒于崩溃
    今年二、三月间由抢购黄金风潮而触发的席卷资本主义世界的严重金融危机，是美元垮台和以美元为中心的资本主义世界货币体系开始崩溃的重要标志。三月十六日，美国纠集几个主要资本主义国家在华盛顿商量对策，被迫宣布不再维持公开市场上三十五美元一盎司的黄金价格。这表明它在维持黄金官价方面已经落到山穷水尽的地步。不维持公开市场，金价必然上涨。黄金在国际市场上的价格上涨，就等于美元不能保持它对黄金的固定官价，就是美元的实际贬值。美国黄金官价是战后资本主义世界货币体系所依靠的一根重要支柱，目前这根支柱开始倒塌了。
    约翰逊政府现在拚命死保以美元为标准的各国货币汇率相对固定的现行汇价制度。要保住各国货币汇价关系不变，必须首先稳住美元平价。美国目前所采取的应急措施是：（一）继续要求各国中央银行不把美元兑换黄金。（二）为了应付外汇市场投机风潮，美国已把同各国的互惠信贷从七十余亿美元扩大到九十三亿美元。（三）国内实行紧缩，增加税收，削减民用开支，向劳动人民开刀，把危机转嫁到劳动人民身上。
    但是，这些办法不仅难以实行，而且实行起来也必然要加剧美国国内外的矛盾，因而只能使美国陷入更严重的经济和政治危机。
    美元危机的根本症结，是美国的侵略和战争政策造成的通货膨胀和国际收支逆差。基本矛盾解决不了，只靠一些修修补补的办法，当然无济于事。而且法、美在货币领域内的矛盾最近又有新的发展。三月二十九日开始在斯德哥尔摩举行的西方十国财长会议，所以成为资本主义各国注目的中心，就是因为帝国主义国家，特别是法、美之间要对现行资本主义世界货币体系的改革问题进行重大摊牌。如果以美元为标准的资本主义各国货币汇价关系解体，现行汇率关系就将打乱，结果是资本主义世界货币体系的彻底瓦解。各国货币的汇率关系一陷入混乱，以现行汇率关系为基础的各国贸易往来、资金移动及其他经济活动，都将出现一片动荡和混乱局面。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。以美元危机为中心的资本主义世界金融危机的发展，必将加速帝国主义制度的全面崩溃。（附图片）
