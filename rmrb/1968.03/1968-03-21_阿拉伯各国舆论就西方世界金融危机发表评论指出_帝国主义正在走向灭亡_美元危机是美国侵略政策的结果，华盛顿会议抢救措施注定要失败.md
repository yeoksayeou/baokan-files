Newspapers in Syria and Iraq have recently pointed out that the current financial crisis in the Western world indicates that the imperialist system is accelerating its collapse.

An article published in Syria's *Al-Ba'ath* on the 19th stated: "The current financial crisis in the Western world is the result of U.S. imperialist aggression." The article said, "The gold reserve countries, in order to protect the dollar, recently held a meeting in Washington, but their attempts are doomed to fail because the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism will not change."

An article published in Syria's *Al-Thawra* on the 19th also pointed out: "The current crisis, which is manifested by the rush to buy gold, is actually a crisis of the imperialist system, and this crisis is accelerating the collapse of the imperialist system."

An article published in this newspaper on the 18th said: This crisis is a natural result of imperialism's opposition to the peoples of all countries. The article said: "Imperialism is now at its end." "The responsibility of the peoples of all countries is to redouble their efforts to weaken imperialism's strength and thereby eliminate it from the world."

The Iraqi News Agency published a commentary on the 18th pointing out that the serious financial and economic crisis currently being experienced by the imperialist countries led by the United States clearly exposes the crisis of imperialism.

The commentary pointed out that one of the main causes of the current imperialist crisis is the vigorous development of the national liberation movements around the world. The commentary said that oppressed nations and peoples are gaining independence one after another, which destroys a major pillar of the imperialist system.

The commentary said that U.S. imperialism is currently sending more troops to invade South Vietnam, but contrary to its wishes, the U.S. aggression in Vietnam has consumed huge financial expenditures, and the U.S. has a huge deficit in its revenue and expenditure, and the U.S. economy can no longer withstand a major impact.

Newspapers in Cairo, Damascus, and Algiers pointed out that the current financial crisis in the capitalist world, especially the dollar crisis, is a result of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, which is shaking the hegemony of the dollar and the pound in the capitalist world monetary system.

A commentary in Cairo's *Al-Jumhuriya* on the 16th said that the U.S. failure in Vietnam and its rampant criminal policy at home "are disastrous for the Western monetary system, which is based on the dollar and the pound."

The newspaper pointed out: The adventurous policies of imperialism have made countries around the world no longer trust the value of the dollar or the pound, and imperialism's insistence on its policies of aggression and domination will not be able to get out of this predicament.

A commentary in Damascus's *Al-Thawra* on the 16th also pointed out: The U.S. financial difficulties are the result of its aggression in Vietnam. It pointed out that the current financial crisis clearly indicates that capitalism is heading for destruction.

Algeria's *Al-Mujahid* on the 16th pointed out that a major crisis is shaking the Western world, and the United States, which is preparing for elections and continuing to spend large amounts of money every day to maintain its aggression in Vietnam, is in a state of panic.

The newspaper said that the dollar's chronic illness has led to the current situation, and this crisis fully exposes the bankruptcy of the capitalist monetary system.

The Algerian News Agency commented on the measures taken by the United States to rescue the crisis, saying that these measures cannot save the U.S. economy from its deeply rooted troubles.

    阿拉伯各国舆论就西方世界金融危机发表评论指出
    帝国主义正在走向灭亡
    美元危机是美国侵略政策的结果，华盛顿会议抢救措施注定要失败
    新华社二十日讯　叙利亚和伊拉克的报刊舆论最近指出，目前西方世界的金融危机表明帝国主义制度正在加速崩溃。
    叙利亚《复兴报》十九日发表文章说：目前西方世界的金融危机“是美帝国主义的侵略政策引起的”。文章说，“黄金总库”国家为了保护美元最近在华盛顿举行会议，但是他们的企图是注定要失败的，因为美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。
    叙利亚《革命报》十九日也发表文章指出：“目前以抢购黄金风潮表现出来的危机，实际上是帝国主义制度的危机，这个危机加速了帝国主义制度的崩溃。”
    这家报纸十八日发表的一篇文章说：这次危机是帝国主义反对世界各国人民的自然结果。文章说：“帝国主义现在已是末日临头。”“世界各国人民的责任是加倍努力地进行斗争，以削弱帝国主义的力量，从而把它们从世界上消灭掉。”
    伊拉克通讯社十八日发表评论指出，以美国为首的帝国主义国家正在经历的严重的财政金融危机十分清楚地暴露了帝国主义的危机。
    评论指出，造成帝国主义目前的危机的一个主要原因，是全世界民族解放运动的蓬勃发展。评论说，被压迫民族和人民纷纷取得独立，这就破坏了帝国主义制度的一根主要支柱。
    评论说，美帝国主义目前正向越南南方增派侵略军，但是，同它的愿望相反，美国对越南进行的侵略耗费了巨大的财政开支，美国在收支方面出现了庞大赤字，美国的经济已经变得经不起巨大的冲击了。
    新华社十八日讯　开罗、大马士革和阿尔及尔的报纸指出，目前资本主义世界的金融危机，特别是美元危机，是美国侵略越南的一个结果，它动摇着美元和英镑在资本主义世界货币体系中的统治地位。
    开罗《共和国报》十六日的社论说，美国在越南的失败以及在国内的猖狂的犯罪政策等“对以美元和英镑为支柱的西方货币制度都是灾难性的”。
    这家报纸指出：帝国主义的冒险政策使世界各国不再信任美元或英镑的价值了，帝国主义坚持它们的侵略和统治政策，就无法摆脱这种困境。
    大马士革的《革命报》十六日发表的评论也指出：美国在财政金融方面的困境是它侵略越南造成的。它指出，当前的金融危机明显地表明了资本主义正在走向灭亡。
    阿尔及利亚的《圣战者日报》十六日指出，一场大危机正震撼着西方世界，正在准备进行大选和继续每天拿出大量资金来维持在越南的侵略战争的美国已经惶惶不安了。
    这家报纸说，美元的痼疾导致出现目前的局势，这场危机充分暴露了资本主义货币制度的大破产。
    阿尔及利亚新闻社在评论美国为了挽救危机所采取的措施时说，这些措施无法使美国经济摆脱根深蒂固的祸患。
