Further Fully Implement the Brilliant "March 7" Directive of Great Leader Chairman Mao
Establish a Leadership Corps Unlimitedly Loyal to Chairman Mao to Seize Power for the Proletariat

Shanghai held a grand rally to celebrate the establishment of revolutionary committees in all full-time higher education institutions, with Comrade Zhang Chunqiao attending and delivering a speech.

The proletarian cultural revolution is a revolution to seize leadership on the educational front, a revolution to cultivate and train successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and it is related to whether the proletarian cultural revolution can be carried out to the end, and to the future of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The newly born revolutionary committees must focus on studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts, establish Chairman Mao's thought study classes, lead the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to fight against class enemies, eliminate interference from rightist and ultra-leftist trends, continue to overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, and rectify the Party organization and revolutionary mass organizations in the struggle, and build up the class ranks.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 11th: Under the brilliant guidance of the "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives of Great Leader Chairman Mao, revolutionary committees have been established in all 24 full-time higher education institutions in Shanghai. Today, more than ten thousand proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary faculty, staff, and students from Shanghai's educational front held a grand rally to celebrate the establishment of revolutionary committees in all full-time higher education institutions and to inaugurate a new high tide of educational revolution. With profound proletarian feelings of unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Great Leader Chairman Mao, they reported the good news to Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts. They resolved to unite even more closely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fully implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives without any deviation, to strive for the thorough victory of the proletarian cultural revolution and the proletarian educational revolution.

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, including Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, and other leaders attended the rally to extend warm congratulations. Responsible comrades from the Shanghai Military District's Three Armies Military and Political Training Team also attended the rally.

The rally pointed out that the proletarian educational revolution is a revolution to seize leadership on the educational front, a revolution to cultivate and train successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and it is related to whether the proletarian cultural revolution can be carried out to the end, and to the future of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Chairman Mao has always emphasized the importance of leadership in his teachings on educational revolution. We must not understand the educational revolution merely as a revolution in teaching methods. Curricula, systems, and other aspects need reform, but the primary task is to solve the problem of leadership, to establish a leadership corps that is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao spoke at the rally. He demanded that after the establishment of revolutionary committees, higher education institutions must focus on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, establish Chairman Mao's thought study classes, seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution, and thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev. The newly born revolutionary committees must seize power for the proletariat, use proletarian party spirit to seize power, lead the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to fight against class enemies, eliminate interference from rightist and ultra-leftist trends, continue to overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, and rectify the Party organization and revolutionary mass organizations in the struggle, and build up the class ranks.

Today, Red Guards and revolutionary faculty, staff, and students from various higher education institutions and some secondary schools entered the Cultural Revolution Square in high spirits and with fighting determination. They held red revolutionary books and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's quotations, singing revolutionary songs.

At the beginning of the rally, they first reviewed Great Leader Chairman Mao's brilliant "March 7" directive. The Red Guards, with hearts full of joy and excitement, read out a report of good news to the most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao. They proudly said: The establishment of revolutionary committees in all full-time higher education institutions in Shanghai marks a new stage in the proletarian cultural revolution movement in Shanghai's higher education institutions. This is another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! It is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! They said that the current battle task before them is: to strengthen and improve the newly born revolutionary committees, to achieve the revolutionization of the revolutionary committee leadership corps, to seize power and use power well for the proletariat, to establish and run Chairman Mao's thought study classes, to achieve the thought revolutionization of people with "criticize revisionism and repudiate oneself" as the key, to intensify class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, to rectify the Party organization and revolutionary mass organizations, to fully implement Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, a series of latest directives, and a series of directives on educational revolution, to inaugurate a new high tide of educational revolution, and to achieve the overall victory of the proletarian cultural revolution!

    无产阶级教育革命是在教育战线上夺取领导权的革命，是培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的革命，关系到无产阶级文化大革命能否进行到底，关系到中国革命和世界革命的前途。新诞生的革命委员会要大抓活学活用毛泽东思想，大办毛泽东思想学习班，带领无产阶级革命派和革命群众对阶级敌人进行战斗，排除来自右的和极“左”方面的思潮的干扰，继续打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，在斗争中整顿党的组织和革命群众组织，把阶级队伍树立起来。
    新华社上海十一日电　在伟大领袖毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，上海二十四所全日制高等学校全部成立了革命委员会。今天，上海教育战线上的一万多名无产阶级革命派和革命的师生员工，隆重举行庆祝全日制高等学校全部建立革命委员会，掀起教育革命新高潮誓师大会。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，向我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席报喜。他们决心更紧密地团结在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不折不扣地全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命和无产阶级教育革命的彻底胜利而奋斗。

    大会指出，无产阶级教育革命是在教育战线上夺取领导权的革命，是培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的革命，关系到无产阶级文化大革命能否进行到底，关系到中国革命和世界革命的前途。毛主席历来关于教育革命的教导，早就指出了领导权的重要性。我们决不能把教育革命仅仅理解为教学方法的革命。课程、学制等方面是需要改革的，但是首要的是解决领导权的问题，确立无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的领导班子，领导本单位的斗、批、改。
    张春桥同志在会上作了讲话。他要求高等院校在建立了革命委员会以后，要大抓活学活用毛泽东思想，大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席光辉的教育革命思想，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线。新诞生的革命委员会必须为无产阶级掌权，用无产阶级党性掌权，带领无产阶级革命派和革命群众对阶级敌人进行战斗，排除来自右的和极“左”方面的思潮的干扰，继续打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，在斗争中整顿党的组织和革命群众组织，把阶级队伍树立起来。
    今天，来自各高等学校和部分中等学校的红卫兵小将和革命的师生员工，意气风发，斗志昂扬，列队进入文化革命广场。他们手捧红彤彤的革命宝书，一遍一遍地学习毛主席语录，高唱革命歌曲。
    大会一开始，首先重温了伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“三·七”指示。红卫兵小将怀着万分喜悦和激动的心情，宣读了给最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的报喜信。他们豪迈地说：上海全日制高等学校全部建立革命委员会，标志着上海高等学校的无产阶级文化大革命运动进入了一个崭新的阶段，这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！他们说，现在摆在我们面前的战斗任务是：大力巩固和完善新诞生的革命委员会，实现革命委员会领导班子的革命化，为无产阶级掌好权、用好权，大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，实现人的思想革命化；狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争，整顿党的组织和革命群众组织，全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示、一系列最新指示和关于教育革命的一系列指示，掀起教育革命新高潮，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
