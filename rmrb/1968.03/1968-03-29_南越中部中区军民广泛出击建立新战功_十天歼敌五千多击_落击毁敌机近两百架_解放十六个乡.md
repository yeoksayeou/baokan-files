The military and civilians in the central region of South Vietnam have launched widespread attacks and achieved new victories. In the ten days from March 4 to March 13, they employed flexible and mobile tactics in the plains, mountains, and cities, achieving significant victories. According to statistics, the military and civilians in the region annihilated 5,310 enemy troops in these ten days, including more than 2,200 American invaders and 200 South Korean mercenaries.

During these ten days, the military and civilians in the central region attacked 50 important enemy targets in the provinces of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Binh Thuan, Kon Tum, Gia Lai, and Dac Lac. These targets included 18 towns, 16 American and puppet airfields, 16 American and puppet artillery positions and parking lots, as well as the headquarters of American and puppet army divisions and regiments. They annihilated a large number of enemy forces.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces also conducted consecutive ambushes on the 1st, 14th, and 19th highways, cutting off enemy supply lines and annihilating a large number of American and puppet troops.

During these ten days, the military and civilians in the central region shot down and destroyed nearly 190 enemy aircraft, destroyed or damaged nearly 310 military vehicles (including 147 tanks and armored vehicles), and destroyed 42 cannons. They also burned down 14 military warehouses.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces captured and forced the enemy to withdraw from many outposts and sentry points. The local people, in close cooperation with the People's Liberation Armed Forces, destroyed the enemy's reactionary rule, demolished nearly 20 "strategic hamlets" and concentration camps, and liberated 16 villages with a population of 120,000 in the outskirts of some county towns in Binh Dinh and Phu Yen provinces.

In the anti-American national salvation war, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam have firmly grasped the initiative of the war, roaming freely on the land of the motherland, and bravely fighting the enemy.
