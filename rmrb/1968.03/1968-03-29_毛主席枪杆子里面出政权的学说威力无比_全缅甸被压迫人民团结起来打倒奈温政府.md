The Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party issued a declaration on March 18 commemorating the 20th anniversary of the armed revolutionary struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

All Oppressed People of the Nation, Unite to Overthrow the Paper Tiger—Ne Win's Military Government

—Declaration by the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party on the 20th Anniversary of the Armed Revolutionary Struggle Led by the Burmese Communist Party

(1) The victories achieved in the protracted war in Burma are great victories of the great Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary war led by the Burmese Communist Party began on March 28, 1948, and has now lasted exactly 20 years.

The series of victories we have achieved in this protracted war are great victories of the great people of the Union of Burma; they are great victories of the Burmese Communist Party, armed with the correct thought that there is no other way but to resist the enemy's armed suppression with armed force; they are great victories of the correct guiding principles of the Burmese Communist Party and contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought; they are great victories of the proletariat of all countries and the oppressed people of the whole world; they are great defeats of the reactionaries of all countries, headed by U.S. imperialism, and of modern revisionism, headed by the Soviet Communist Party leadership, who have been advocating the parliamentary road to this day.

Long live contemporary Marxism-Leninism—the great Mao Zedong Thought!

(2) Unite to Overthrow the Ne Win Fascist Government, Which Is Surrounded on All Sides

The traitor Ne Win military government is facing an unprecedented and insoluble economic, political, organizational, and military crisis.

The facts of the past six years of the traitor Ne Win military government's rule show that their so-called Burmese-style pseudo-socialist program cannot solve this crisis in the slightest. This bunch of people openly attack Marxism-Leninism, rely on imperialism and revisionism, and practice military dictatorship of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. They say they want to build socialism, which is a blatant swindle.

These traitors collude with all imperialists and all revisionists, using imperialist and revisionist military equipment and money to expand the civil war. But they have fallen into a crisis. This bunch of national traitors attack the Burmese Communist Party as traitors, national traitors, destroyers of the Union of Burma, destroyers of state sovereignty, people who recognize the enemy as their father, and destroyers of religion, all to cover up their true colors. The thief cries "Stop thief," which is really laughable. This bunch of traitors have not the slightest qualification to wave the banner of the nation.

To consolidate their power, this bunch of traitors have also adopted a set of false land policies to deceive the peasant masses. But the peasant masses, who have suffered so much, have seen through their tricks. The fact that the peasant masses are still suffering exposes the swindle of this bunch of national traitors. The fact that this bunch of traitors had to dissolve the fake Land Committee in October 1966 shows that their land policy has failed, while the 24th notice on the rice problem and the first decree are acts of persecution against the peasants and the people of the whole country.

This bunch of traitors have now put forward the slogan of opposing the People's Republic of China, forcing workers to work overtime and exploiting them, and issuing a series of orders to suppress workers.

This bunch of traitors similarly oppress students, urban poor, petty bourgeoisie, intellectuals, technicians, patriotic national capitalists, and all nationalities within the country.

Therefore, to achieve liberation from the oppression of this fascist government, the only way is for the oppressed people of all nationalities in the Union of Burma to unite and overthrow the Ne Win military government.

The situation at home and abroad is better than ever.

We will surely accomplish the historical mission entrusted to us and overthrow the Ne Win military government to establish a new people's democratic government that the people of the whole country long for.

(3) The People's Democratic Revolution Led by the Burmese Communist Party Will Surely Win

Twenty years of armed struggle have proved that no class enemy can destroy the Burmese Communist Party.

In the course of these twenty years of armed struggle, the Burmese Communist Party has gained many experiences and lessons with its blood, among which the important experiences and lessons are:

1. A Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has a thousand and one conditions, but the most important one is to gain the support of the oppressed people. With this condition, no matter how much military and financial aid the U.S. and British imperialists and the revisionists, as well as the reactionaries of various countries, provide to the Burmese reactionary rulers, and no matter how much they scheme and strive, they can never use reactionary war to destroy the Communist Party.

The fact that the government has changed hands five times in the past twenty years, and the current Ne Win military government's all-around crisis, shows: whoever wants to destroy the Communist Party will only bring about their own destruction.

2. Practice has proved that Chairman Mao's theory that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun is correct and has unparalleled power. Whenever there is any wavering or deviation from this theory, it will bring difficulties to the revolution and cause the revolution to suffer setbacks. The principle that the party commands the gun and the gun must not command the party is a very precious experience and lesson for the Burmese Communist Party.

3. Twenty years of history have proved that Chairman Mao's line of protracted war of rural base areas surrounding the cities and finally seizing political power is correct.

4. The fact that we have been able to persist in a long-term armed struggle for twenty years proves that in a small country like Burma, a Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, as long as it relies on the rural base areas and the peasant masses, can wage a long-term war.

5. Practice has also proved that the unity and mutual support of the international proletariat are necessary, but it is possible to rely mainly on self-reliance to wage a protracted war.

6. In the above situation, a country engaged in armed struggle, whether it is adjacent to or far from a socialist country, or for some reason, the party of this country has its connection with a socialist country interrupted for a considerable period, can also wage a long-term, unyielding struggle against the enemy.

7. The history of the world revolution and the twenty-year history of the armed struggle in Burma provide an important experience: there must be a Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to lead the revolution to achieve victory. Therefore, it must be believed that only under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party can the Burmese people's democratic revolution achieve victory.

8. To achieve this victory, it is also necessary to solve the land problem and the national problem, which are very important problems in the Burmese revolution.

The Burmese Communist Party, which has gained these experiences and lessons in theory and practice, relying on the strength of the oppressed people, will surely defeat the Ne Win fascist government, which is surrounded on all sides.

Down with the Ne Win military government!

All oppressed people of the nation, unite!

All nationalities, unite to oppose the common enemy—the Ne Win military government!

Overthrow the Ne Win fascist military government!

The people's democratic revolution led by the Burmese Communist Party will surely win!

Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live Chairman Thakin Than Tun!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    缅共中央发表关于纪念缅共领导的革命武装斗争二十周年的声明
    毛主席枪杆子里面出政权的学说威力无比
    全缅甸被压迫人民团结起来打倒奈温政府
    新华社二十八日讯　缅甸共产党中央委员会三月十八日发表关于纪念缅甸共产党领导的革命武装斗争二十周年的声明。声明全文如下：
    全国被压迫人民团结起来，打倒纸老虎——奈温军人政府
    ——缅甸共产党中央委员会关于纪念缅甸共产党领导的革命武装斗争二十周年声明
      （一）缅甸在持久的战争中所取得的
  胜利，是伟大的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东
  思想的伟大胜利
    缅甸共产党领导的革命战争，从一九四八年三月二十八日开始，到今年三月二十八日，已经整整二十年了。
    我们在这个持久的战争中所取得的一系列的胜利，是缅甸联邦伟大人民的伟大胜利；是以除了用武力反抗敌人的武力镇压外，别无其他道路可走这一正确思想武装起来的缅甸共产党的伟大胜利；是缅甸共产党的正确指导方针、当代马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的伟大胜利；是各国无产阶级和全世界被压迫人民的伟大胜利；是以美帝国主义为首的各国反动派，和一直到现在还在鼓吹议会道路的、以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义的重大失败。
    当代的马克思列宁主义——伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
    （二）团结起来，打倒已经陷入四面
    楚歌的奈温法西斯政府
    卖国贼奈温军人政府正面临着一场空前未有的、无法解决的经济、政治、组织和军事危机。
    卖国贼奈温军人政府执政六年多的事实表明，他们的所谓缅甸式的假社会主义纲领，根本无法解决这场危机。这一伙人公开攻击马克思列宁主义学说，依靠帝国主义和修正主义，实行军人垄断资产阶级专政，他们说要建设社会主义，完全是一场明目张胆的诈骗。
    这些卖国贼勾结一切帝国主义、勾结一切修正主义，拿帝国主义和修正主义的军事装备和金钱来扩大内战。但是，他们反而陷入了危机。这一伙民族败类攻击缅甸共产党是卖国贼、民族败类、缅甸联邦的破坏分子、国家主权的破坏者、认贼为父的人、宗教的破坏者，无非是为了掩盖他们的真面目。贼喊捉贼，实在滑稽。这一伙卖国贼根本就没有一丝半点的资格打出什么民族的旗号。
    这一伙卖国贼为了巩固自己的政权，还采用了一套虚假的土地政策来欺骗农民群众。但是，受尽苦难的农民群众已经识破了他们的阴谋诡计。农民群众还在受苦受难的事实就揭穿了这一伙民族败类的骗局。这一伙卖国贼不得不在一九六六年十月解散伪土地委员会的事实表明，他们的土地政策已经破产，而大米问题第二十四号通告和第一号法令却是对农民和全国人民的迫害。
    这一伙卖国贼现在抛出了反对中华人民共和国的口号，强迫工人加班加点，进行剥削，并发出了一系列镇压工人的指令。
    这一伙卖国贼同样压迫学生、城市贫民、小资产阶级、知识分子、技术人员、爱国的民族资本家和国内各民族。
    因此，为了从这个法西斯政府压迫下取得解放，唯一的道路是，缅甸联邦各族被压迫人民团结起来，打倒奈温军人政府。
    国内外形势空前大好。
    我们一定能够胜利完成历史所赋予我们的任务，打倒奈温军人政府，建立全国人民所期望的人民民主新政府。
    （三）缅甸共产党领导的人民民主革命必胜
    二十年的武装斗争证明，任何阶级敌人都无法消灭缅甸共产党。
    在这二十年武装斗争的过程中，缅甸共产党用鲜血换得了许多经验教训，其中重要的经验教训是：
    一、用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党，千条万条，取得被压迫人民的支持是最主要的一条。有了这一条，不管美英帝国主义者和修正主义者以及各国的反动派向缅甸反动统治者提供多少军事的和财政上的援助，出谋划策，奔走卖力，也根本无法用反动的战争来消灭共产党。
    二十年来政府先后更迭五次，以及当今奈温军人政府的全面危机表明：谁想消灭共产党，只能自取灭亡。
    二、实践证明：毛主席关于枪杆子里面出政权这一具有普遍意义的学说是正确的，它具有无比的威力。什么时候对这个学说发生动摇，或者违背这个学说，就会给革命带来困难，使革命遭到挫折。党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党这个原则，对缅甸共产党来说，是一个极其宝贵的经验教训。
    三、二十年的历史证明：毛主席关于以农村为根据地，农村包围城市，最后夺取政权的持久战路线是正确的。
    四、我们能够坚持二十年长期武装斗争的实践证明：在缅甸这样一个小国家，一个用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党，只要以农村为根据地，依靠农民群众，就能进行长期战争。
    五、实践还证明，国际无产阶级的团结和相互支持是必要的，但是，首先可以依靠自力更生进行持久战争。
    六、在上述情况下，一个进行武装斗争的国家，无论是背靠或远离社会主义国家，或者由于某种原因，这个国家的党与社会主义国家的联系被中断相当一个时期，也是能够同敌人进行长期的不屈不挠的斗争。
    七、世界革命的历史和缅甸武装斗争二十年的历史提供的一个重要经验是：必须有一个以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党的领导，革命才能取得胜利。因此，必须坚信，只有在缅甸共产党的领导下，缅甸人民民主革命才能取得胜利。
    八、为了取得这个胜利，还必须解决土地问题和民族问题，这是缅甸革命的非常重要的问题。
    已经从理论和实践上取得了这些经验教训的缅甸共产党，依靠被压迫人民的力量，一定能够打败已经陷入四面楚歌的奈温法西斯政府。
    奈温军人政府必败！
    全国被压迫人民团结起来！
    各民族团结起来，反对共同的敌人——奈温军人政府！
    打倒奈温法西斯军人政府！
    缅甸共产党领导的人民民主革命必胜！
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    德钦丹东主席万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
        缅甸共产党中央委员会
                        一九六八年三月十八日
