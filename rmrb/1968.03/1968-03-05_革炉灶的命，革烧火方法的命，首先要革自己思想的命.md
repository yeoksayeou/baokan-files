Since April 1966, when I took on the task of firing the stove, I have worked with all my comrades to use Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts as our guide. We have learned from the advanced and caught up with the advanced, fully unleashing the subjective initiative of people, constantly breaking through the notion of "no further improvements" and "maximum savings," transforming the furnace, transforming the firing method, and also transforming our own thoughts. This has reduced the coal consumption for cooking from an average of seven liang per person per day to one liang and two qian. I deeply feel that the process of transforming the furnace and saving coal is a process of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's works, fiercely fighting against selfishness, and establishing selflessness, transforming our worldview, and promoting the revolutionization of our thoughts. It is also a process of cultivating and tempering our hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

Transform the Furnace, First Transform the Thoughts

After I took on the task of firing the stove, our unit was studying the advanced experience of Zhang Daolu in transforming the furnace and saving coal. We had already transformed the furnace several times, and the coal consumption had been reduced from over two liang to seven liang. However, we still had not reached Zhang Daolu's advanced level of three liang and five qian. My confidence began to waver. The class leader took the initiative to talk to me. With this issue in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift and daring to struggle and daring to win. Chairman Mao said: "We must always remember that our country is a socialist country, but it is also a backward and poor country. This is a great contradiction. To make our country rich and strong, we need several decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of the policy of thrift and opposing waste in the construction of our country." Chairman Mao also said: "We must eliminate all thoughts of weakness and incompetence within our ranks." As I read and reflected, I realized that whether to learn and dare to learn from advanced experiences is related to the construction of the country and the world revolution. It is a major issue of loyalty or disloyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

With my awareness raised, my enthusiasm was different. I worked with my comrades to repeatedly transform the furnace according to Zhang Daolu's blueprints. After several transformations, it still did not work well. Once, because the fire did not come up, the rice was half-cooked. A large bowl of white rice was left over. Some comrades joked with me: "Huang Baodong, if you keep transforming like this, not only will you save coal, but I think you will also save grain!" Hearing this, I felt very uncomfortable, thinking that I had put in a lot of effort but did not get a good result. My confidence in transforming the furnace waned again. With this issue in mind, I repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," realizing that the so-called "not getting a good result" contained a bit of selfishness. Originally, I wanted to achieve some results in saving coal for cooking to solve my problem of joining the party. This thought is not the reflection of the bourgeois worldview of "merging public and private interests" advocated by China's Khrushchev? I realized that to transform the furnace well, we must first transform our thoughts. Thus, I made up my mind to use the process of transforming the furnace as a battle to attack selfishness and let selflessness take root in my mind. After fiercely fighting against my thought of "getting a good result," I had no more worries. I focused on transforming the furnace for the revolution and saving coal for the revolution. With the enthusiastic help and strong support of all the comrades in the company, we tried again and again. After many efforts, we basically mastered Zhang Daolu's advanced methods, reducing the coal consumption to two liang and four qian.

Later, our company moved to a valley. The coal consumption increased back to the seven liang when I first started firing the stove. We transformed the furnace more than fifty times, but it did not come down. What was the problem? It turned out that because we lived in a valley, the terrain was concave, and the wind blew over the mountain top and down, pressing the fire down. Chairman Mao said: "There are two attitudes towards learning. One is the dogmatic attitude, which does not consider the situation in our country, and indiscriminately adopts both applicable and inapplicable things. This attitude is not good. The other attitude is to think with one's brain while learning, to learn those things that are suitable for our country's situation, that is, to absorb beneficial experiences for us. We need this kind of attitude." Chairman Mao's teachings opened my mind. I thought, Zhang Daolu has Zhang Daolu's situation, and we have our situation. We learn from his experience, but the most important thing is to learn from his good thoughts. Simply copying and following in someone else's footsteps is not enough. To achieve new results, we must, on the basis of learning from the advanced, combine our own situation and forge a new path. Later, we fought for more than eight months, working and researching, researching and improving. We transformed the furnace more than 230 times, reducing and maintaining the coal consumption below two liang and four qian.

Cooking for the Revolution, Tempering Loyalty in the Process of Cooking

The new furnace was transformed, and some comrades said this furnace is really "like a dog chasing a duck, quacking!" I was overjoyed. I thought, with this furnace, saving more coal is a sure thing. However, after a week, the coal consumption was still the same. I carefully checked the furnace and found no problems. I then checked the furnace ash and found a few black coal cores in the ash, realizing that the coal was not burned through! It seemed that there was still a problem with the firing method. With this issue in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." Chairman Mao's teachings were like opening a window in my heart, suddenly enlightening me. The furnace and weapons are the same, both are things, dead objects, and they must be mastered by people to fully play their role. A good furnace can save coal, but to turn it into a reality of saving coal, it still depends on people's efforts. If no one makes use of it, the furnace becomes a pile of dirt. And I was exactly like this, after the new furnace was transformed, I let out a sigh of relief, putting all my hopes on the furnace, and did not further unleash the human factor. How could this further save coal? Thus, in the process of firing, I carefully observed the burning situation of the furnace ash. I found that where there were large pieces of furnace ash, the flames were strong, and where there were small pieces of furnace ash, the flames did not come up, forming uneven firepower in the furnace. When pressing the fire, large pieces of furnace ash could not extinguish the fire. Thus, I divided the furnace ash into large, medium, and small pieces. Large pieces of furnace ash have good ventilation and are used as the base, small pieces of furnace ash are not easy to ventilate and are used to press the fire, medium pieces of furnace ash have strong and even firepower and are used to fire, and a little pure coal is added when a large fire is needed. I summarized this firing method into "one look, five additions": one look is to look frequently; five additions are to add frequently, add a little, add lightly, add evenly, and add evenly. Using this method, after many trials, good results were achieved.

Later, I repeatedly pondered the way to save coal. One day, while cooking dinner, I found that the flames in the furnace were strong and hard. At that time, I thought, this furnace ash was just picked from the eggplant field at noon, why is it so easy to burn? After repeated pondering, it turned out that this furnace ash had been exposed to the elements for a long time, and its surface layer of ash had been washed away by the rain. Where can I find such good furnace ash? Thus, as soon as I had free time, I would pick up the furnace ash with a basket. After picking up the furnace ash in the camp, I went outside the camp to pick more. Over a year, I picked up more than four thousand jin of furnace ash.

Furnace ash picked from the eggplant field was so easy to burn, I thought, if other furnace ash is sifted and washed with water, and then dried, it should also be easy to burn. After trials, it was indeed easy to burn. Since then, I sifted, washed, dried, and divided the picked furnace ash into large, medium, and small pieces, and then burned it. This work was dirty and tiring. After a day's work, my waist and legs ached. I thought, can I persist for a long time? But I immediately realized that this was a thought of fearing hardship and fatigue. With this issue in mind, I repeatedly studied the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," further realizing that whether to persist in doing this is a major issue of daring to fight against selfishness in one's mind; it is a major issue of whether to implement or not to implement Chairman Mao's policy of thrift in building the country; it is a major issue of loyalty or disloyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Persisting in doing so, saving more coal, is a political and ideological victory, adding a bit of selflessness, and planting a seed of Mao Zedong Thought. I must not be a captive of selfishness. Thus, I resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, constantly fighting against selfishness, not letting selfishness stay in my mind for a single moment, and persisted in the practice of sifting, washing, drying, dividing, and burning the furnace ash.

Because I persisted in the new firing method and the picking, sifting, washing, drying, dividing, and burning of the furnace ash, the coal consumption was further reduced from two liang and four qian to one liang and seven qian.

"To Save and Make Revolution," Use Revolutionary Spirit to Save

When the coal consumption was reduced to one liang and seven qian, I thought: is this enough saving? I grabbed this fleeting thought and brought it up during the daily reading in the class, asking everyone to help me raise my awareness. Comrades pointed out this thought and studied with me, first selecting Chairman Mao's teachings: "Humanity must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress. The theory of stagnation, pessimistic theory, the theory of doing nothing and being complacent, are all wrong." Then they had a heated discussion. Some said: "The upper reaches have no end, it depends on whether you strive for it or not." Some said: "We can only take the achievements we have made as the starting point. If we think it is the peak, lying on the peak, the advanced will become backward; taking the achievements as the starting point, we can continuously revolutionize and progress." Comrades' speeches made me blush and sit uneasily. I realized that this thought of "good enough" is a thought of stagnation, pessimism, and doing nothing, which is very unworthy of a revolutionary fighter in the era of Mao Zedong.

At this time, our great helmsman Chairman Mao issued the great call to "save and make revolution." I decided to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, with the spirit of continuous revolution, to further transform the furnace and use practical actions to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. I worked with my comrades to study and find ways to further tap the potential of transforming the furnace and saving coal. Comrades put forward many good suggestions. At this time, a local unit successfully experimented with a reverse-door furnace that places the furnace door inside the room. The superior organ immediately organized us to go and observe. This furnace has many advantages, does not require a dedicated person to fire, saves manpower; the furnace door is inside the room, people do not get cold; coal is added only when needed, avoiding waste. However, it is not perfect. On the way back, sitting on the train, I thought, if we combine the advantages of this reverse-door furnace with the advantages of Zhang Daolu's double-eye return-wind furnace, we must be able to save more coal. The suggestions comrades put forward can also be used. Back at the company, I started working with my comrades to transform it. After failures and retries, failures and retries again, for more than a month, after more than seventy trials, we finally transformed a new type of "three-in-one" furnace with horsehoe, reverse-door, and double-eye, reducing the coal consumption from an average of one liang and seven qian per person per day to one liang and two qian (this one liang and two qian refers to the pure coal consumed, not including four liang and four qian of furnace ash and one liang and five qian of firewood. If only pure coal is burned, the average consumption per person per day is less than three liang, and the lowest has reached two liang and six qian).

Chairman Mao taught us: "The masses are the real heroes." I thought, relying on me alone to save coal, no matter how great the achievements, the effect is the smallest. If everyone comes to transform the furnace and save coal, the achievements will be the greatest. I deeply felt the responsibility to help others transform the furnace. Thus, under the arrangement of the superior organ, I successively helped twenty-two units within a few hundred li from Huangbo to Haicheng to transform the furnace. Every time I helped a unit transform the furnace, I first propagated Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift and saving, and the great significance of saving coal, because only Mao Zedong Thought can make the coal emit the greatest heat.

From this practical experience, I deeply felt: to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, it depends on a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and in the process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, this heart is constantly dyed redder. With this heart, one can actively care about national affairs and closely connect ordinary and small tasks with the fate of the country and the future of humanity. With this heart, one will never be complacent and will always take the already achieved peak as a new starting point, achieving "discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress."

### 革炉灶的命，革烧火方法的命，首先要革自己思想的命

    革炉灶的命，革烧火方法的命，
    首先要革自己思想的命
    沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、炊事班长　黄保东
    一九六六年四月我担任烧火工作以来，和全班同志一起，以毛泽东思想为指针，学先进，赶先进，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，不断破除无所作为、节约到顶的思想，革炉灶的命，革烧火方法的命，同时也革自己思想的命，使炊事用煤量从平均每人每天烧七两降低到一两二钱。我深深体会到，改灶节煤的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，改造世界观，促进思想革命化的过程，也是培养锻炼自己无限忠于毛主席的一颗红心的过程。
    改灶先改造思想
    我在担任烧火工作以后，班里正学习张道路同志改灶节煤的先进经验，已经进行过多次改灶，耗煤量也由二斤多降低到了七两，但是仍然没有达到张道路同志三两五钱三的先进水平。我信心有些不足了。班长主动和我谈心。我带着这个问题，学习毛主席关于节约和敢于斗争、敢于胜利的语录。毛主席说：“要使全体干部和全体人民经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”毛主席又说：“我们应当在自己内部肃清一切软弱无能的思想。”我边读边想，认识到了对先进经验学不学，敢不敢学，关系到国家建设和世界革命，是对毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线忠不忠的大问题。
    认识提高了，劲头就不一样。我和班里同志一起，一遍又一遍地照着张道路的图纸改起来。改了几次，还是没有改好。一次，因为火上不来把饭做夹生了，白花花的大米饭剩了一大盆。有的同志对我开玩笑说：“黄保东呀，照你这样改下去，不但煤节约了，我看粮食也节约了！”听了这话，我心里很不是滋味，觉得费了不少劲，还没落个好。改灶的信心又低落下来。我带着这个问题反复学习“老三篇”，认识到所谓没“落个好”，里面夹杂着一个“私”字。原来我想在节约炊事用煤上做出一些成绩，以早日解决我的入党问题。这种思想，不正是中国赫鲁晓夫所大力宣扬的“公私溶化论”的资产阶级世界观的反映吗？我认识到要改好灶，首先要改造好思想。于是下定决心把改灶的过程，作为向“私”字打进攻战，让“公”字在头脑里扎根的过程。狠斗了我那个“落个好”的思想以后，我就什么顾虑也没有了，一个心眼地想着为革命改灶，为革命节煤。在全连同志热情帮助和大力支持下，我们一次又一次试验起来。经过多次努力，基本上掌握了张道路同志的先进方法，使耗煤量下降到二两四钱。
    后来，我们连队搬到山沟里边，耗煤量又回升到我刚烧火时的七两。连续改灶五十多次，都没有降下来。这是怎么回事呢？原来是因为我们住在山沟里，地势凹，风一越过山顶就往下刮，压得火起不来。毛主席说：“学习有两种态度。一种是教条主义的态度，不管我国情况，适用的和不适用的，一起搬来。这种态度不好。另一种态度，学习的时候用脑筋想一下，学那些和我国情况相适合的东西，即吸取对我们有益的经验，我们需要的是这样一种态度。”毛主席的教导，使我心里开了窍。我想，张道路有张道路的情况，我们有我们的情况，我们学习他的经验，最主要的是学习他的好思想，照葫芦画瓢，踩着人家的脚印走是不行的。要创出新的成绩，还要在学先进的基础上结合自己的情况，闯出一条新的路子来。后来我们连续战斗了八个多月，边干边研究，边研究边改进，先后改灶二百三十余次，把耗煤量又降低并保持在二两四钱以下。
    为革命烧火，在烧火中炼忠心
    新灶改成了，有的同志说这个灶真是“狗撵鸭子呱呱叫哇！”我打心里往外高兴。我想，凭这灶，节约更多的煤，是十拿九稳了。可是，过了一个星期，耗煤量还是那么多。我仔细检查了炉灶，没有发现毛病。我又检查炉渣，发现了炉灰里有几个黑乎乎的煤核，这才知道，原来是煤还没有烧透哩！看来烧火方法还有问题。我带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”毛主席的教导，好象在我的心里打开了一扇窗户，忽然亮堂了。炉灶和武器一样，都是物，是死的东西，要靠人去掌握才能充分发挥它的作用。好灶能节煤，但要变成节煤的现实，还要通过人的努力。如果没有人去发挥它的作用，灶就变成了泥土一堆。而我就是这样，在新灶改成后，松了一口气，把希望全部寄托在灶上，没有进一步发挥人的因素，这怎么能进一步节煤呢？于是，我在烧火中仔细观察炉渣燃烧情况，我发现有大块炉渣的地方火苗很旺，碎炉渣的地方火苗起不来，形成炉膛火力不匀；压火时，大块的炉渣又不能把火压死。于是我就把炉渣分成大、中、小块，大块的炉渣通风好，就用来垫底，小块的不易通风，用来压火，中块的火力旺、火力匀，用来烧火，需要大火时再少添一点纯煤。我把这种烧火法归纳成一看五添：一看就是勤看；五添就是勤添、少添、轻添、平添、匀添。采用这种方法，经过多次试验，取得了很好的效果。
    以后，我又反复琢磨节煤的路子。一天做晚饭时，我发现炉膛里的火苗又旺又硬。当时我想，这种炉渣是中午刚从茄子地里拣来的，它为什么这么好烧呢？经过反复琢磨，原来是因为这种炉渣，天长日久，它表面上的灰层被雨水冲洗掉了。这么好的炉渣上哪里去找呀！于是我一到休息时间提着土篮就去拣。营区的炉渣拣完了，我又到营区外面去拣。一年多来，我共拣回炉渣四千多斤。
    从茄子地里拣来的炉渣，竟然这样好烧，我联想到，如果把其它炉渣筛一筛，再用水洗一洗，晒干后不也同样好烧吗？经过试验，果然好烧得很。打这以后，我把拣来的炉渣都过筛、冲洗、晒干、分成大中小块，然后再烧。这种活，又脏又累人。干完一天活，腰酸腿疼。我想，长期坚持下去，身体吃得消吗？但我立刻意识到这是怕苦怕累的思想。带着这个问题，我又反复学习了《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作，进一步认识到：能不能这样做下去，就是敢不敢和头脑里的“私”字作斗争的大问题；是贯彻不贯彻毛主席勤俭建国方针的大问题；是忠于不忠于毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席革命路线的大问题。坚持做，多节煤，就在政治上和思想上打了一次胜仗，增加了一分为公的思想，深扎了一次毛泽东思想的根子。我决不能做“私”字的俘虏。于是我坚决按毛主席教导的“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神，不断斗私，不让“私”字在脑子里有一分一秒的停留机会，坚持了筛、洗炉渣这种做法。
    由于我坚持了新的烧火方法和对炉渣的拣、筛、洗、晒、分、烧，耗煤量又从二两四钱降低到了一两七钱。
  “要节约闹革命”，用革命精神节约
      当耗煤量降到一两七钱的时候，我想：节约得差不多了吧！我抓住这一闪而过的活思想，在班里天天读的时候亮了出来，请大家帮助我提高认识。同志们针对这种思想，同我一起首先选读了毛主席的教导：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点，都是错误的。”然后进行了热烈的讨论。有的说：“上游无止境，看你争不争。”有的说：“我们只能把取得的成绩当作起点，如果认为是顶点，躺在顶点上，先进就会变后进；把成绩当起点，才能不断革命，不断前进。”同志们的发言，说得我脸发热，坐不住。我认识到了这种“差不多”的思想，就是停滞的思想，悲观的思想，无所作为的思想，这与一个毛泽东时代的革命战士是很不相称的。
    正在这时，我们伟大的舵手毛主席发出了“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召。我决心以毛主席最新指示为武器，以不断革命精神，进一步改灶，用实际行动来紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。我又和班里同志一起研究，想办法再挖掘改灶节煤的潜力。同志们提了很多好意见。这时地方上试验成功一种把灶门放在室内的反门灶，上级机关立即组织我们去参观。这种灶的优点很多，不需要专人烧火，省了人力；灶门在室内，人不受冻了；需要添煤时才添煤，避免浪费。但是也不够完善。回来时，坐在火车上我想，要是把这种反门灶的优点和张道路的双眼回风灶的优点结合起来，一定能节约更多的煤，同志们提的那些办法也可以用上了。回到连队，我就和班里同志动手改起来。经过了失败，重来；再失败，再重来，前后一个多月，试验七十多次，终于改成了一个马蹄、反门、双眼的新型“三结合”灶，使耗煤量从平均每人每天一两七钱降低到一两二钱（这一两二钱是指所消耗的纯煤，不包括炉渣四两四钱，劈柴一两五钱。如果光烧纯煤，平均每人每天烧三两以下，最低时达到过二两六钱）。
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”。我想，靠我一个人节煤，成绩再大，效果也是最小最小。如果大家都来改灶节煤，成绩就是最大最大的了。我深深感到有责任去帮助别人改灶。于是我在上级机关的安排下，先后为黄柏至海龙几百里内的二十二个单位改了灶。每帮助一个单位改灶时，我总是首先向他们宣传毛主席勤俭节约的教导，宣传节煤的重大意义，因为只有毛泽东思想才能让煤发出最大的热量来。
    从这一段实践中，我更深深体会到：要落实毛主席的最新指示，靠的是一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，而在落实毛主席最新指示的过程中，又不断把这颗红心染得更红。有了这颗红心，就能自觉地关心国家大事，把平凡细小的工作同国家的命运、人类的前途紧密连在一起。有了这颗红心，就会永不自满，不断把已有的顶点当成新的起点，做到“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”。　（新华社）
