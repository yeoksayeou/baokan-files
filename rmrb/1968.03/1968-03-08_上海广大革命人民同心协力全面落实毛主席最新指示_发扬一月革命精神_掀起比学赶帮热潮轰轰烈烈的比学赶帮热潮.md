A wave of emulation, learning, and helping each other has surged in Shanghai, the birthplace of the "January Revolution." This wave, with the goal of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is a brilliant revolutionary practice of Shanghai's revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai has seen a high tide of consolidating and developing revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones. The mass emulation and learning movement has developed on this basis. In early February, Xuhui District and Huangpu District took the lead in launching revolutionary competitions. Huangpu District, the first in Shanghai to establish a district-level revolutionary three-in-one provisional power organ, had a good work foundation with 93% of its grassroots units achieving revolutionary three-in-ones; Xuhui District, which established its revolutionary committee later, had only 67% of its grassroots units achieving revolutionary three-in-ones. The Xuhui District Revolutionary Committee, in learning from and catching up with Huangpu District, mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and earnestly learned and sincerely caught up. It eventually surpassed Huangpu District, and by February 16, all its grassroots units had established revolutionary committees, becoming the first district in Shanghai to achieve a red tide across the entire district. At this time, news came from the capital Beijing that revolutionary committees had been established in all 18 districts and counties in the city and suburbs. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Shanghai were elated and full of fighting spirit, proposing slogans to learn from Beijing, catch up with Beijing; learn from Xuhui, catch up with Huangpu. The city-wide emulation, learning, and helping each other movement developed from two districts to ten districts; from districts to various fronts; from cities to suburban rural areas, everywhere presenting a hot and lively revolutionary scene of mutual pursuit, mutual learning, and mutual help. In a short period, revolutionary committees were established in large numbers at various levels. By the end of February, following Xuhui District, Zhenbei, Yangpu, Luwan, Hongkou, and other districts also achieved a red tide across the entire district. The relatively backward Jing'an District and Putuo District recently consolidated revolutionary great alliances ideologically and successfully achieved revolutionary three-in-ones, thus making all ten districts in Shanghai establish revolutionary committees. The industrial system recently had nine companies and nearly 500 factories establish revolutionary committees, with the metallurgy, chemical, and materials systems achieving a red tide. The education and health systems, especially middle schools, saw a rapid development of the situation. About 90% of middle schools in the city have established revolutionary committees. The suburban situation is also encouraging, with Shanghai, Jiading, Chongming, and Baoshan counties recently establishing revolutionary committees.

Shanghai's current wave of emulation, learning, and helping each other first focused on accelerating the achievement of revolutionary three-in-ones, and then developed to rectifying the party organization, strengthening party building, deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, and promoting production.

Great leader Chairman Mao said: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." Various fronts in Shanghai, following Chairman Mao's instructions, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively. Leading organs held them, grassroots units held them, the masses held them, and residential families held them, with study classes blooming everywhere. The broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary cadres, with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, swept away bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist thoughts, and enhanced proletarian party spirit. In early February this year, the Municipal Revolutionary Committee timely made the decision to "carry forward the spirit of the January Revolution and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions," which greatly inspired the revolutionary spirit of the broad revolutionary people of Shanghai. Thus, advanced requirements had new breakthroughs, achieving a higher level; backward requirements sped up, catching up with the advanced. In this way, a wave of emulation, learning, and helping each other surged vigorously.

The magnificent wave of emulation, learning, and helping each other in Shanghai has several distinctive features:

First, emulation, learning, and helping each other are primarily about emulating revolutionary thinking, learning revolutionary thinking, and promoting the revolutionary transformation of thinking. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Shanghai, in the process of emulation, learning, and helping each other, continued to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively, making emulation, learning, and helping each other a process of using Mao Zedong Thought to continuously overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts, and a process of achieving the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. The Xuhui District Revolutionary Committee, based on Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the spirit of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee's "February 5" decision, took Huangpu District as an example, reviewed and checked the work of the previous stage, found the gap in following Chairman Mao's latest instructions compared to Huangpu District, immediately caught up vigorously, and grasped ideological education, continuing to hold and improve various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Chairman Mao's latest instructions shone in every corner of the district, and the revolutionary masses were full of spirit, creating outstanding achievements in learning from and catching up with Huangpu District.

Second, fully mobilizing positive factors from all aspects, organizing revolutionary forces, and uniting hearts and minds to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Workers in factories, soldiers and officers executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, revolutionary cadres in organs, revolutionary teachers and students in schools, and revolutionary residents in lanes, as well as white-haired elders and lively children, all joined the revolutionary torrent of emulation, learning, and helping each other. More than a million households of working people held family study meetings. Retired workers and housewives are all contributing to the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The 21 middle schools in Xuhui District that last achieved revolutionary three-in-ones did so under the help of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams composed of the PLA, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary workers, revolutionary residents (revolutionary martyrs' families, retired workers), and Red Guards. They held Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively, fought against selfishness, overthrew bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhanced proletarian party spirit, and achieved revolutionary three-in-ones. Revolutionary masses on various fronts also sent "treasures" to each other's doors or went out to "learn from experience," mutually learning and helping each other, forming a single rope and a single heart, and striving together to promote the rapid and comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Third, the vigorous wave of emulation, learning, and helping each other promoted the revolutionary transformation of the thinking of leading cadres, and the continuous revolutionary transformation of the thinking of leading cadres in turn led the mass movement to a new level. Chairman Mao taught us: "If there is only the enthusiasm of the masses without a powerful leading cadre to properly organize the enthusiasm of the masses, then the enthusiasm of the masses can neither be sustained nor can it be directed correctly and raised to a higher level." Under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in various districts, counties, industries, departments, and units in Shanghai has achieved great successes. However, some units' revolutionary committees' leading cadres have developed pride, slackness, and difficulty in facing challenges. When this wave of emulation, learning, and helping each other came, some comrades were not well-prepared and the leadership was not strong enough. Leading cadres of revolutionary committees at various levels, in their leading work, honestly learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, and seriously carried out self-reform. In this way, they continuously promoted their own revolutionary transformation of thinking in leading the movement, and their continuous revolutionary transformation of thinking in turn enabled them to better lead the movement. The leading cadres of the Huangpu District Revolutionary Committee, in the process of revolutionary competition with Xuhui District, found the gaps four times, deeply realizing that the pride and self-satisfaction of leading cadres were the "stumbling blocks" in Huangpu District's revolutionary work. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind," removed the "stumbling blocks," and caught up, making the work of the entire district present a lively and vigorous new situation. Many leading comrades of revolutionary committees also followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "you must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better," going deep into the front lines and fighting together with the revolutionary masses. They talked with the masses, analyzed contradictions with the masses, solved contradictions with the masses, further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, and powerfully promoted the progress of revolutionary three-in-ones and other work.

    上海广大革命人民同心协力全面落实毛主席最新指示
    发扬一月革命精神  掀起比学赶帮热潮轰轰烈烈的比学赶帮热潮
    促进了领导成员的思想革命化，领导成员思想不断革命化又引导群众运动提高到新水平
    新华社上海六日电　一个以全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利为战斗目标的比学赶帮热潮，在“一月革命”策源地上海市蓬勃兴起。这是上海市无产阶级革命派和革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的又一光辉的革命实践。
    今年以来，上海出现了巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合的高潮。群众性的比学赶帮运动，就是在这个基础上发展起来的。二月初，徐汇区和黄浦区首先展开革命竞赛。上海第一个建立区级革命三结合临时权力机构的黄浦区，由于工作基础好，已有百分之九十三的基层单位实现了革命三结合；徐汇区革命委员会建立较晚，所属基层单位实现革命三结合的只占到百分之六十七。徐汇区革命委员会在学黄浦、赶黄浦中，发动群众，依靠群众，扎扎实实地学，认认真真地赶，后来居上，到二月十六日，所属基层单位就全部建立了革命委员会，在上海第一个实现了全区一片红。正在这个时候，首都北京传来了城郊十八个区县全部成立革命委员会的喜讯。上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众欢欣鼓舞，斗志昂扬，纷纷提出学北京，赶北京；学徐汇、赶黄浦的战斗口号，全市的比学赶帮，从两个区发展到十个区；从区发展到各条战线；从城市发展到郊区农村，到处出现你追我赶，互学互帮的热气腾腾的革命景象。在一个较短的时间内，各级革命委员会大量地建立起来了。到二月底，继徐汇区之后，闸北、杨浦、卢湾、虹口等区都实现了全区一片红。比较后进的静安区和普陀区，最近也从思想上巩固了革命大联合，并且胜利地实现了革命三结合，从而使上海市内十个区全部建立了革命委员会。工业系统最近又有九个公司和近五百个工厂建立了革命委员会，冶金、化工、物资三个系统实现了一片红。教育卫生系统，特别是中学，形势发展很快。全市已经有百分之九十左右的中学建立了革命委员会。郊区形势也令人鼓舞，在最近又有上海、嘉定、崇明、宝山四个县建立了革命委员会。
    上海这次比学赶帮热潮，首先从加速实现革命三结合方面展开，继而发展到整顿党的组织加强党的建设，深入开展革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改，以及抓革命、促生产等方面。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”上海各条战线遵照毛主席的指示，大办毛泽东思想学习班。领导机关办，基层单位办，群众办，居民家庭办，学习班遍地开花。广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，以“斗私，批修”为纲，横扫资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思想，增强了无产阶级党性。今年二月初，市革命委员会及时作出了“发扬一月革命精神，全面落实毛主席最新指示的决议”，极大地鼓舞了上海广大革命人民的革命斗志。于是，先进的要求有新的突破，实现更上一层楼；后进的要求快马加鞭，迎头赶上先进。这样，一个比学赶帮热潮就轰轰烈烈地展开了。
    上海兴起的波澜壮阔的比学赶帮热潮，有几个显著的特点：
    一、比学赶帮，首先是比思想革命化，学思想革命化，促进思想革命化。上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众在比学赶帮中，继续大办毛泽东思想学习班，使比学赶帮成为用毛泽东思想不断战胜资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的过程，成为实现人的思想革命化的过程。徐汇区革命委员会根据毛主席的最新指示和市革委会“二·五”决议的精神，以黄浦区为榜样，回顾检查了前一阶段的工作，找到了对毛主席最新指示跟得不如黄浦区紧的差距，立刻急起猛追，狠抓思想教育，继续大办和办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀全区每个角落，革命群众意气风发，在学黄浦、赶黄浦中创造了出色的成绩。
    二、充分调动各方面的积极因素，把革命力量组织起来，同心协力，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。工厂的革命工人、执行“三支”“两军”任务的解放军指战员、机关的革命干部、学校的革命师生、里弄的革命居民，白发苍苍的老人和天真活泼的孩子，都投入了比学赶帮的革命洪流。有上百万户劳动人民家庭举办了家庭学习会。退休老工人、家庭妇女都在为全面落实毛主席的最新指示作出贡献。徐汇区最后实现革命三结合的二十一所中学，就是在由解放军、革命干部、革命工人、革命居民（军烈属、退休工人）、红卫兵等组成的毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠斗“私”字，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，实现了革命三结合的。各条战线的革命群众还送“宝”上门，或出门“取经”，互学互帮，拧成一股绳，结成一条心，为促进迅速全面落实毛主席的最新指示而共同奋斗。
    三、轰轰烈烈的比学赶帮热潮促进了领导成员的思想革命化，领导成员思想不断革命化又引导群众运动提高到新的水平。毛主席教导我们：“如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，上海市各区县、各行业、各部门、各单位的无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的成就。但是，有些单位革命委员会的领导成员，滋长了骄傲、松劲和畏难情绪。在这次比学赶帮潮头到来的时候，有些同志思想准备不足，领导不够有力。各级革命委员会的领导成员在领导工作中，老老实实地活学活用毛泽东思想，认真进行自我改造。这样，他们在领导运动中不断促进自己的思想革命化，而自己思想不断革命化又使他们更好地去领导运动。黄浦区革命委员会领导成员在同徐汇区开展革命竞赛过程中，曾经四次找差距，深刻认识到领导成员的骄傲自满是黄浦区革命工作进展的“绊脚石”。他们认真学习毛主席关于“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，搬掉“绊脚石”，迎头赶上去，全区工作出现了生动活泼的新局面。许多革命委员会的领导同志还遵照毛主席关于“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导，深入第一线，和革命群众战斗在一起。他们和群众一起谈心，一起分析矛盾，解决矛盾，进一步密切了干部和群众的关系，有力地推动了革命的三结合和其他各项工作的进展。
