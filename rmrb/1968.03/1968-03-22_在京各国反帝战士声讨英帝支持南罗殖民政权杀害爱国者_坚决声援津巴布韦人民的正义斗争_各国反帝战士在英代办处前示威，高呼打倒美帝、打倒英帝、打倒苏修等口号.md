In recent days, the Smith colonial regime in Southern Rhodesia has brutally murdered Zimbabwean patriots, sparking immense outrage among the revolutionary peoples of Africa and the world. Over a hundred anti-imperialist fighters from 28 countries in Africa and other regions, along with some Chinese comrades, gathered today in front of the British Representative Office to protest. They strongly condemned British imperialism for supporting and strengthening the Smith fascist regime, and denounced the Smith regime's heinous crimes against Zimbabwean patriots. They expressed their resolute support for the just struggle of the Zimbabwean people.

The anti-imperialist fighters carried portraits of the great leader of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao, and banners written in English, French, Arabic, and Chinese. They gathered in front of the British Representative Office in China, chanting slogans: "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with British imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Down with Smith's rule in Rhodesia!" "Long live the liberation struggle of Zimbabwe!" "Long live the liberation struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long live the great leader of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao!"

The anti-imperialist fighters posted slogans and cartoons in front of the British Representative Office. Their representative read a protest letter to the British Representative in China, Hopson.

The protest letter strongly condemned British imperialism for using counter-revolutionary tactics, supporting and strengthening the Smith fascist regime, and openly colluding with the South African fascist regime. It brutally and cruelly suppressed and murdered the people of Zimbabwe and South Africa. The protest letter solemnly warned that if the British government insisted on its course, it would certainly end up hurting itself, just like American imperialism in Vietnam. British imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger and will surely be swept away by the powerful storm of the peoples of the world.

    新华社二十一日讯 南罗得西亚史密斯殖民政权最近连续残暴杀害津巴布韦爱国者的法西斯暴行，激起了非洲革命人民和全世界革命人民的极大愤慨。在北京的非洲和其他地区二十八个国家的一百多名反帝战士，以及一部分中国同志，今天在英国代办处前举行游行示威，强烈抗议英帝国主义支持和强化史密斯法西斯政权，声讨史密斯法西斯政权杀害津巴布韦爱国者的滔天罪行，表示坚决声援津巴布韦人民的正义斗争。
    各国反帝战士，高举着世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席像，举着用英文、法文、阿拉伯文和中文书写的标语牌，来到英国驻中国代办处门前，高呼口号：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒英帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“打倒史密斯在罗得西亚的统治！”“津巴布韦的解放斗争万岁！”“亚非拉人民的解放斗争万岁！”“中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”各国反帝战士在英国代办处门前张贴了标语、漫画，他们的代表向英国驻中国代办霍普森宣读了抗议书。
    抗议书强烈谴责英帝国主义玩弄反革命两面手法，支持和强化史密斯法西斯政权，并公开与南非法西斯政权进行勾结，野蛮、残酷地镇压和杀害津巴布韦人民和南非人民。抗议书郑重警告说，英国政府如果一意孤行，就一定要搬起石头砸自己的脚，一定要遭到象美帝国主义在越南国土上一样的命运。英帝国主义只不过是纸老虎，它一定要被全世界人民的强大暴风骤雨所扫除。
