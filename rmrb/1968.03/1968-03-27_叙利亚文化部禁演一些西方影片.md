Syria's Ministry of Culture has banned several films from the United States and other Western countries from being shown in Syria this year. These films maliciously insult Arabs and arrogantly glorify invaders. Recently, the Minister of Culture, Tourism, and National Guidance, Suhail al-Ghazi, issued an order prohibiting all films produced by the American "Sigma Film Company" from being shown in Syria.

    叙利亚文化部禁演一些西方影片
    叙利亚文化部今年以来陆续禁止一些美帝国主义和西方国家的影片在叙利亚上演，因为这些影片恶毒地侮辱阿拉伯人，狂妄地美化侵略者。叙利亚文化、游览和国家指导部部长苏海尔·加齐最近发布了一项命令，禁止美国“西格马电影公司”拍制的所有影片在叙利亚上演。
