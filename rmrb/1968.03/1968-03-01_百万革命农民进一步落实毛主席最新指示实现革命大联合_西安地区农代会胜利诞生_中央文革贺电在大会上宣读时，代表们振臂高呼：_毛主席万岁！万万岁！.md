Under the guidance of the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, and amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of thousands of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary peasants in the Xi'an region have achieved revolutionary unity. On February 28, they successfully convened the Xi'an Region Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Revolutionary Peasants Representative Conference.

This conference is a gathering where the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary peasants in the Xi'an region further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. It is a conference for the great unity, great solidarity, and grand rally of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary peasants in the Xi'an region. It is also a mobilization conference to seize the opportunity for an even greater harvest this year and to immediately launch the first battle of spring farming production. The convening of this conference is another victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and another victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a congratulatory telegram to the conference. When the telegram was read at the conference, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause and firecrackers, and the representatives repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The representatives at the conference listened to a report titled "Comprehensively Implement the Latest Instructions of Our Great Leader Chairman Mao, Seize the Complete Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Rural Areas of Xi'an Region." The representatives unanimously agreed that the rural areas of Xi'an Region, like the rest of the country, have an unprecedentedly good situation that is getting better and better. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has never been as widespread and profound as it is now. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprouted up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain in the vast rural areas of Xi'an Region. So far, more than a thousand sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held, with over twenty million people participating in the study. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary peasants have launched a revolutionary criticism, fiercely attacking the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Xi'an Region, and eliminating the poison they spread in the countryside. After Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions were issued, out of the 86 communes in the Xi'an Region, 82 have already achieved revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and revolutionary committees are being established one after another.

Through more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the class consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres has been greatly enhanced. They love our great leader Chairman Mao even more, love the great Mao Zedong Thought even more, love Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line even more, and are more determined than ever to follow the socialist road. The collective economy has been further consolidated and developed. Last year, despite severe drought conditions, the Xi'an Region achieved a fairly good harvest. Now, a spring farming production upsurge is forming.

Comrade Huang Jingyao, a responsible comrade of the Shaanxi Provincial Military Support Group, spoke at the conference. He, on behalf of the Shaanxi Provincial Military Support Group, the Provincial Military Region, and all the officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Shaanxi, extended warm congratulations to the conference. He said that in the more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary peasants, and rural revolutionary cadres in the Xi'an Region have made significant contributions by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieving double victories in revolution and production. He hoped that in the new year, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary peasants in the Xi'an Region would hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism" as the key link, continue to deeply develop the revolutionary criticism, develop and consolidate the revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units. They should further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, guard against all sabotage activities by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Representatives from the Shaanxi Province Great Unity Consultative Conference, the Xi'an Region Workers' Congress, the Shaanxi Province Higher Education Red Guards Congress, the Xi'an Region Middle School Red Guards Congress, the Provincial and Municipal Government Great Unity Committee, and the People's Liberation Army representatives who are responsible for the "three supports, two militaries" tasks all attended the conference to extend their warm congratulations.

The conference, amidst warm applause and cheers, adopted a telegram of respect to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

The conference also passed the "Decision on Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production, Immediately Launching a Greater Spring Production Upsurge."
