One day in the New Year, as soon as it was light, the heroic people of Hue and their military forces launched attacks on the enemy at West Lac Airport, Mang Ca District, and other places. The sound of gunfire rang out continuously, like the firecrackers people set off during the New Year, crisp and rapid. In a short while, flames blazed up in the enemy's nests. The gates of Hue City were opened. The liberation forces divided into three columns and rushed into the city, beginning their attack on the enemy's administrative areas. Many high-ranking officials of the puppet government in Hue were either captured or surrendered.

By nine o'clock that morning, the people and military of Hue had completely taken control of the city. Even the heavily guarded American military headquarters at the Hue Hotel was occupied by the liberation forces. Many buildings of the puppet government and rooftops saw the rise of the flags of the National Liberation Front.

At this time, a unit of the liberation forces arrived at the flagpole in the ancient citadel, ordered to hoist the brilliant red and blue flag with the golden star atop the high flagpole. There, during the August 1945 general uprising of the Vietnamese people, the glorious red flag with the golden star first appeared. Today, the heroic people of South Vietnam were determined to let the flag symbolizing the victory and struggle of the Vietnamese people flutter in the sky above the ancient city.

Stubborn remnants of the enemy were still entrenched at the flagpole. The liberation forces rushed towards the flagpole like the wind, led by liberation soldier Nguyen Van Tien. This heroic soldier, who had participated in many battles, had fought in the attacks on the enemy bases at An Loc and Chi Hiep during the winter and spring of 1966-1967. Now, Nguyen Van Tien was once again at the forefront of the battle with his comrades.

As they approached the flagpole, the enemy fired at them from all directions. Nguyen Van Tien held the flag tightly, advancing along the city wall. At this critical moment, Nguyen Van Tien thought not of himself but of the glorious mission he carried—hoisting the flag of the National Liberation Front atop the flagpole, letting it flutter high in the sky over Hue City. He thought of the joy and encouragement the oppressed working people would feel when they saw the red and blue flag with the golden star rising in the city's sky. With this in mind, Nguyen Van Tien suddenly found an immense strength, and with his comrades, braved the hail of bullets to charge forward.

The liberation forces' machine guns roared in anger. In a short while, the enemy's firing points fell silent, and the remaining diehards fled. The enemy stronghold beneath the flagpole quickly fell into the hands of the liberation forces. Nguyen Van Tien led his soldiers, seizing the victory, and rushed to the flagpole, eliminating the enemy soldiers there, and capturing the flagpole. They tore down the "three flags" of the Saigon puppet regime and shredded them to pieces. At ten o'clock on the morning of January 31, 1968, a brilliant and resplendent flag of the National Liberation Front was hoisted on the forty-meter-high flagpole in Hue City.

Under the glorious light of the National Liberation Front's flag, the people's liberation forces marched forward bravely, invincible in all directions.

    胜利红旗迎风飘
    新春的一天，天刚亮，英雄的顺化军民就在西禄机场、芒嘉区等地向敌人发起进攻。枪声接连响了起来，有如人们在新春燃放的鞭炮，清脆而急促。不一会，敌人的巢穴里，燃起了熊熊的烈火。顺化市的各个城门被打开了。解放武装力量分三路冲进市内，开始进攻敌人行政区。顺化市伪政权的许多高级官员，有的被捕，有的投降。
    当天早上九时，顺化军民已完全控制这个城市，连防守非常严密的美军驻所顺化旅店也被解放军占领了。许多伪政权机关和屋顶上升起了民族解放阵线旗帜。
    这时，一支解放武装力量的队伍来到了古皇城的旗台，奉命把灿烂的金星红蓝旗插上高高的旗台。那里，当一九四五年八月越南人民总起义时，就是最先出现光辉的金星红旗的地方。今天，英雄的南越人民决心要让象征越南人民胜利和战斗的旗帜在古城上空迎风飘扬。
    顽固的残敌仍然在旗台盘踞着。解放军队伍象飞一样奔向旗台，为首的是解放军战士阮文线。这个身经数战的英雄战士，在一九六六年—一九六七年的冬春季，参加了攻打敌人在安禄、慈夏基地的战斗。现在，阮文线又和战友们奔驰在战斗的第一线。
    当他们快要接近旗台的时候，敌人从各个角度向他们射击。阮文线把旗抱得紧紧的，沿着城墙前进。在这个关键的时刻，阮文线想到的不是自己，而是自己肩负的光荣任务——把民族解放阵线的旗帜插到旗台上，让它在顺化市上空高高飘扬。他想到当苦难深重的劳动人民看到金星红蓝旗在市内上空升起的时候，将会如何幸福！得到多大的鼓舞啊！想到这里，阮文线陡然增加了无比巨大的力量，和战士们冒着枪林弹雨，坚决冲向前去。
    解放军愤怒的机枪吼叫起来了，不一会，敌人的火力点变成哑巴，余下的顽固分子夺路而逃，旗台下面的敌军据点，迅速落入解放军手里。阮文线率领战士们乘胜前进，冲到旗台下，消灭了旗台下的敌军，夺取了旗台。他们把旗台上的西贡傀儡集团的“三条旗”扯了下来，撕得粉碎。一九六八年一月三十一日早上十点钟，顺化市内四十多米高的旗台上，升起了一面光辉夺目的民族解放阵线的金星红蓝旗。
    在光荣的民族解放阵线旗帜的光辉照耀下，人民解放武装力量各路部队奋勇向前，所向无敌。
