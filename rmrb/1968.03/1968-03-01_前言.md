		Preface

Chairman Mao has taught us: "We must resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchy that exists in many places."

The anarchist trend is indeed harmful! Workers feel the pain in their hearts, and the enemy rejoices. If we do not overthrow anarchism and strengthen the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, we cannot better fight the enemy, we cannot fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and we cannot better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We, the working class, must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, raise our iron fists, and overthrow, expose, and completely eradicate anarchism from within our working class!

Anarchism is utterly bad. In politics, it denies everything; in production, it does as it pleases; in organization, it splits the ranks; in ideology, it disperses fighting spirit. Some people who do not walk the right path but take the wrong path, engage in anarchism without feeling ashamed, and even call it "rebellious spirit," "self-education," and so on. When we old workers hear this, it makes our lungs burst with anger!

We must never forget how miserable the situation was in Anshan Steel under the rule of Japanese imperialism in the old society. How many class brothers, for the sake of their families, were bent over by heavy labor; how many class brothers were whipped by the Japanese devils until they were covered in wounds and became permanently disabled, their families separated; how many class brothers were tortured and persecuted, dying miserably in factories and mines. At that time, to eat at Anshan Steel, one had to risk one's life.

The red sun rose from the east, and Chairman Mao, the great savior of the Chinese people, liberated us workers from the abyss of suffering. We workers have gone from being beasts of burden to becoming masters of the state. We must never forget all this! We fight day and night at the steel industry base of our motherland, Anshan Steel, shouldering the heavy burden of supporting the socialist revolution and construction, and supporting the world revolution. Everyone feels very honored. However, the class enemies who are not willing to admit defeat are trying to use the anarchist trend to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat, obstruct the revolution, and disrupt production. We, the working class, must never relax our vigilance!

Now, Anshan Steel, through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, has launched a campaign against the anarchist trend and has achieved great victories. Many class brothers who were influenced by the anarchist trend have stood up to eliminate the influence of the anarchist trend. We, the working class of Anshan Steel, are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production," put national interests first, and with a strong sense of responsibility as masters, bravely shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, and push the revolution and production to new heights.

    前言
    毛主席教导我们说：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态”。
    无政府主义思潮真是害人不浅啊！工人看到痛在心头，敌人看到喜于眉尖。不打倒无政府主义，不加强无产阶级的革命纪律性，就不能更好地同敌人战斗，就不能全面落实毛主席的最新指示，就不能更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。我们工人阶级一定以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，挥起钢铁的拳头，把无政府主义打倒，搞臭，把它从我们工人阶级内部彻底铲除！
    无政府主义坏透了。它在政治上否定一切，生产上随心所欲，组织上分裂队伍，思想上涣散斗志。一些正路不走走歪路的人，闹无政府主义不觉丑，还美其名曰“造反精神”、“自己教育自己”，等等。咱们老工人一听，把肺都要气炸了！
    我们决不能忘记，在旧社会日本帝国主义统治下的鞍钢是怎样悲惨的情景，多少阶级兄弟为了一家老小糊口，被沉重的劳动压弯了腰；多少阶级兄弟被日寇的皮鞭子抽打得遍体鳞伤，变成终生残废，全家妻离子散；多少阶级兄弟被折磨迫害，惨死在工厂、矿山。那时，要吃鞍钢的饭，就得拿命换。
    红太阳从东方升起，中国人民的大救星毛主席把我们工人从苦难的万丈深渊里解放出来，我们工人由当牛做马的地位变成了国家主人。这一切，我们工人怎能忘记！我们日夜战斗在祖国钢铁工业基地鞍钢，肩负着支援社会主义革命和社会主义建设，支援世界革命的重担，大家都感到十分光荣。但是，不甘心失败的阶级敌人却妄图利用无政府主义思潮，破坏无产阶级专政，阻碍革命，破坏生产。我们工人阶级万万不能松懈警惕啊！
    现在，我们鞍钢通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，对无政府主义思潮展开了围剿，已经取得了很大胜利。一些受无政府主义思潮影响的阶级兄弟纷纷起来清除无政府主义思潮的影响。我们鞍钢工人阶级决心遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，以国家利益为重，发扬主人翁的高度责任感，勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担，把革命和生产推向新高潮。
