The Former County Revolutionary Committee fully utilizes the combat role of wired broadcasting, promptly conveying Chairman Mao's latest directives to the hearts of the commune members, and using wired broadcasting to organize the people of the entire county to launch a major criticism and struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev.

	XINHUA, Taiyuan - After the Former County Revolutionary Committee of Shanxi Province was established in February 1967, it fully utilized the combat role of wired broadcasting to rapidly and repeatedly disseminate Chairman Mao's great directives, occupying the rural battlefield with Mao Zedong Thought.

	Former County is located in the Taihang Mountains, with a scattered population. The Former County Revolutionary Committee utilized the more than 7,200 wired broadcasting loudspeakers installed in various communes, production brigades, and production teams to connect all the mountain villages in the county.

	In February last year, under the leadership of Comrade Chen Yonggui, the Former County proletarian revolutionary faction engaged in fierce struggles to seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the county committee. The Former County Broadcasting Station repeatedly broadcasted the great leader Chairman Mao's battle cry, "Fire Upon the Headquarters," calling on the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire county to rise up and fight, launching an attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Former County.

	After the victory of the February seizure of power, the leadership cadres at various levels needed to be replenished and strengthened. At this critical moment, the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" was published. The Former County Broadcasting Station promptly relayed the broadcast from the Central People's Broadcasting Station. Comrade Chen Yonggui also went to the broadcasting station to give a broadcast speech to the rural cadres of the entire county. The comrades at the broadcasting station also took these broadcast recordings to 20 communes, playing them for 110,000 people, inspiring the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. They bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, further replenishing and strengthening the leadership cadres at various levels.

	In 1967, when the proletarian cultural revolution achieved decisive victories, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Former County gathered in front of the broadcasting loudspeakers, their hearts turned towards the red sun and Tiananmen, seriously listening to the extremely important speech given by Vice Chairman Lin Biao at the celebration rally in the capital. The next day after the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xizhai Commune listened to Vice Chairman Lin's speech, 18 brigades held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Under the leadership of the Former County Revolutionary Committee, the Former County Broadcasting Station closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, repeatedly broadcasting the joyous news of the great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central South, and East China, and broadcasting a series of extremely important latest directives given by Chairman Mao during the inspection. Revolutionary masses in various industries listened to Chairman Mao's latest directives and took action, launching a mass movement to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and bourgeois ideas" and to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

	On the brilliant New Year's Day of 1968, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Former County once again gathered in front of the broadcasting loudspeakers, listening to the New Year's editorial from Beijing broadcasted by the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily. The Former County Broadcasting Station broadcasted this editorial continuously for ten days and sent people to the countryside to organize the poor and lower-middle peasants to listen. The entire county launched a wave of studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives and the various battle tasks proposed in the New Year's editorial.

	Each commune held a mobilization meeting, and each production brigade successively formulated battle measures. The broadcasting station also conducted extensive propaganda and reporting, encouraging them to make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

	On March 7 of this year, the great leader Chairman Mao's famous "March 7" directive on the great strategic deployment of the proletarian cultural revolution was reissued. The Former County Broadcasting Station broadcasted it continuously and also broadcasted reports on some typical units implementing the "March 7" directive, making this great directive known to every household and pushing the revolutionary masses of the entire county to further follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and advance towards victory.

	The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Former County harbor deep hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev. The Former County Revolutionary Committee utilized wired broadcasting to organize the people of the entire county to launch a major criticism and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the original Shanxi Provincial Committee, Jinzhong Regional Committee, and Former County Committee, who attempted to restore capitalism. Thousands of people participated in the central rally held in the county seat, and 180,000 people in the entire county gathered in front of the broadcasting loudspeakers in various communes, brigades, and production teams to listen. The Former County Revolutionary Committee held such rallies six times. Through major criticism and struggle, the masses' class struggle and line struggle consciousness was heightened.

	"Learning from Dazhai in agriculture" is a great call issued by the great leader Chairman Mao. However, before the proletarian cultural revolution, Dazhai, located in Former County, had its leadership usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. This handful of capitalist roaders not only did not promote Dazhai's experience but also fiercely opposed Dazhai, plotting to cut down the red flag erected by Chairman Mao. After the Former County Revolutionary Committee was established, it continuously used wired broadcasting and other propaganda forms to promote the spirit of Dazhai. The broadcasting station held a "Learning from Dazhai" special program, inviting Chen Yonggui, the Party branch secretary of Dazhai, brigade leader Jia Chengran, and other comrades from Dazhai brigade to give broadcast speeches, introducing advanced examples of learning from Dazhai from various places. Since February last year, the broadcasting station has almost every day played recordings of Dazhai commune members' speeches for representatives from other places who came to visit, and made 3,000 copies of Dazhai commune members' speech tapes for the visiting representatives, spreading the spirit of Dazhai to various parts of the country. Now, following Chairman Mao's words and walking the path of Dazhai has become the conscious action of the broad revolutionary masses in the rural areas of Former County.

	Over the past year, the Former County Revolutionary Committee has been very concerned about the work of the broadcasting station. The core group of the Former County Communist Party and the responsible comrades of the county revolutionary committee often studied Chairman Mao's works together with the proletarian revolutionary faction of the broadcasting station, engaged in self-criticism and repudiation of revisionism together, and discussed the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought together, helping the broadcasting station solve problems in its work. County Revolutionary Committee Chairman Comrade Chen Yonggui encouraged the comrades at the broadcasting station to remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "Strive to do a good job in broadcasting and serve the people of the whole country and the people of the whole world." The proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses of the Former County Broadcasting Station are determined to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, and fight for the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

    昔阳县革委会充分发挥有线广播的战斗作用
    把毛主席最新指示及时传到社员心坎里
    并利用有线广播，组织全县人民对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派进行大批判、大斗争
      新华社太原电　山西省昔阳县革命委员会在一九六七年二月成立以后，充分发挥有线广播的战斗作用，迅速地、反复地传播毛主席的各项伟大指示，用毛泽东思想占领农村阵地。
    昔阳县位于太行山区，群众居住分散。县革命委员会利用安在各公社、生产大队、生产队的七千二百多只有线广播喇叭，把全县各个山村联系起来。
    去年二月，以陈永贵同志为首的昔阳县无产阶级革命派在向县委内一小撮走资派夺权的激烈搏斗中，昔阳县广播站反复播送了伟大领袖毛主席发出的《炮打司令部》的战斗号令，号召全县贫下中农群起奋战，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在昔阳县的代理人发起进攻。
    二月夺权胜利以后，各级领导班子需要充实和健全。正在这个时刻，《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》发表了。昔阳县广播站及时转播了中央人民广播电台的广播。陈永贵同志还到广播站向全县农村干部作广播讲话。广播站的同志又带着这些广播录音到二十个公社，向十一万群众播放，鼓舞了广大贫下中农和革命干部。他们勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担，进一步充实和健全了各级领导班子。
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的一九六七年国庆节，昔阳县广大贫下中农聚集在广播喇叭前面，心向红太阳，心向天安门，认真地听取林彪副主席在首都庆祝大会上作的极为重要的讲话。西寨公社的贫下中农和革命干部收听林副主席讲话后的第二天，就有十八个大队举办了毛泽东思想学习班。昔阳县广播站在县革委会领导下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，反复播送了伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区的喜讯，播送了毛主席在视察中所作的一系列极为重要的最新指示。各行各业广大革命群众收听了毛主席的最新指示，闻风而动，掀起了以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班的群众运动。
    光辉灿烂的一九六八年元旦，昔阳县贫下中农又都聚集在广播喇叭前面，倾听从北京传来的《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论。昔阳县广播站连续十天广播了这篇社论，并且派人到农村去，组织贫下中农收听。全县掀起了一个大学习、大宣传、大贯彻毛主席最新指示和元旦社论提出的各项战斗任务的热潮。
    各公社召开了誓师大会，各生产大队先后订出了战斗措施，广播站又作了广泛的宣传报道，鼓励他们为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利作出新贡献。
    今年三月七日，伟大领袖毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署的著名的“三·七”指示全文重新发表，昔阳县广播站连续广播，另外还广播报道了一些贯彻执行“三·七”指示的典型单位的经验，使这一伟大指示做到家喻户晓，推动着全县革命群众进一步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，胜利前进。
    昔阳县广大贫下中农和革命干部对中国赫鲁晓夫无比仇恨。昔阳县革命委员会利用有线广播，组织全县人民对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在原山西省委、晋中地委、昔阳县委的代理人妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，进行了大批判、大斗争。几千人参加的中心会场设在县城，全县十八万人民分别聚集在各公社、大队、生产队的广播喇叭前收听。象这样的大会，昔阳县革命委员会举行了六次。通过大批判、大斗争，使广大群众提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。
      “农业学大寨”，是伟大领袖毛主席发出的伟大号召。但是在无产阶级文化大革命以前，大寨所在的昔阳县被党内一小撮走资派篡夺了领导权。这一小撮走资派不仅不推广大寨的经验，而且疯狂反对大寨，阴谋砍倒毛主席树立起来的这面红旗。昔阳县革命委员会成立后，不断通过有线广播，还配合采用其他宣传形式，宣传大寨精神。广播站举办了“学大寨”专题节目，邀请大寨党支部书记陈永贵、大队长贾承让和大寨大队其他同志作广播讲话，介绍各地学大寨的先进事例。广播站从去年二月以来，几乎每天都给外地来参观的代表放大寨社员的讲话录音，并为参观的代表复制了三千盘大寨社员讲话录音带，把大寨的精神传播到全国各地去。现在，听毛主席的话，走大寨的路，已成为昔阳县农村广大革命群众的自觉行动。
    一年来，昔阳县革命委员会非常关心广播站的工作。中共昔阳县核心小组和县革命委员会的负责同志，经常和广播站的无产阶级革命派一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起研究宣传毛泽东思想，帮助广播站解决工作中的问题。县革委会主任陈永贵同志，勉励广播站的同志牢记毛主席关于“努力办好广播，为全中国人民和全世界人民服务”的教导。昔阳县广播站的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而战斗。
