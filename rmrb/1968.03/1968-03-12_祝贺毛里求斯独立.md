Today, the island nation of Mauritius in East Africa declared its independence! This is the result of the long struggle of the Mauritian people against colonial rule. The Chinese people extend their heartfelt congratulations to the people of Mauritius.

Mauritius is a country with fertile land and abundant resources. Since the 16th century, Dutch, French, and British colonialists have successively invaded this country, establishing brutal colonial rule and subjecting the Mauritian people to ruthless exploitation and oppression. Since then, the Mauritian people have been plunged into the deep disaster of colonialism.

From the time of the colonial invasion, the Mauritian people began their heroic struggle against colonialism and for national independence. In recent years, with the rise of the African national liberation movement, the Mauritian people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence has also developed, dealing continuous blows to British imperialism. It is under such circumstances that British imperialism has had to agree to Mauritius's independence.

However, imperialism and old and new colonialism are not willing to accept their defeat and continue to use every means to maintain their colonial interests in Africa, still attempting to control and enslave independent African countries politically, militarily, economically, and culturally. Therefore, the Mauritian people still face the arduous task of continuing to struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism and to safeguard and consolidate their national independence.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out when receiving African friends, "The entire African continent is now in the midst of a wave of opposition to imperialism and colonialism. Whether the countries that have already gained independence or those that have not yet gained independence, one day they will achieve complete and thorough independence and liberation. The entire Chinese people support you."

The Chinese government and people have always sympathized with and supported the Mauritian people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence. The Chinese people and the Mauritian people, the Chinese people and the African people, have always supported and assisted each other in the common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. We believe that after the Mauritian people have gained independence, the friendship between our two peoples forged in the common struggle against imperialism will be further developed, and the friendly relations between our two countries will also be continuously strengthened.

　　祝贺毛里求斯独立
　　本报评论员
    今天，非洲东部的一个岛国毛里求斯宣告独立了！这是毛里求斯人民长期进行反对殖民主义统治的斗争的结果。中国人民向毛里求斯人民表示衷心的祝贺。
    毛里求斯是一个土地肥沃、物产丰富的国家。自十六世纪起，荷兰、法国和英国殖民主义者先后侵入了这个国家，建立了野蛮的殖民统治，对毛里求斯人民进行了残酷的压榨和剥削。从此，毛里求斯人民陷入了殖民主义的深重灾难之中。
    从殖民主义入侵时起，毛里求斯人民就开始进行了反抗殖民主义、争取民族独立的英勇的斗争。近年来，随着非洲民族解放运动的高涨，毛里求斯人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争也日益发展，给予英帝国主义以不断的打击。正是在这样的形势下，英帝国主义不得不同意毛里求斯独立。
    然而，帝国主义和新老殖民主义不甘心于它们的失败，仍然千方百计地要维持它们在非洲的殖民利益，仍然企图从政治上、军事上、经济上、文化上继续控制和奴役非洲独立国家。因此，毛里求斯人民今后还面临着继续反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、维护和巩固民族独立的艰巨的斗争任务。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在接见非洲朋友时指出，“整个非洲现在都处在反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的浪潮中。不管已经获得独立的国家，或者还没有获得独立的国家，总有一天是要获得完全彻底的独立和解放的。整个中国人民都是支持你们的。”
    中国政府和中国人民一向同情和支持毛里求斯人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争。中国人民和毛里求斯人民，中国人民和非洲人民，在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，从来都是相互支持和相互援助的。我们相信，在毛里求斯人民取得独立后，我们两国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中结成的友谊，必将得到进一步的发展，我们两国的友好关系，也将会得到不断的发展。
