The Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee condemns the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs for massacring the people of South Vietnam
Support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and foil the U.S. imperialists' plot of aggression
"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station points out that the more frantically the U.S. imperialists massacre, the faster they will fail

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Khamkeut: The Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee issued a statement on February 28, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists and the South Vietnamese puppet clique for their savage bombing and strafing of the cities of Saigon, Hue, and other cities in South Vietnam, and their massacre of innocent people.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' savage and brutal actions prove that they are in a passive, defensive, and desperate situation, and further expose the U.S. imperialists' stubborn, warlike, and aggressive nature.

The statement said that in order to fulfill their sacred duty to support the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam, the Lao people and soldiers will resolutely fight to foil all the U.S. imperialists' plots to expand the war of aggression in Laos and achieve greater victories.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on March 7: "The Voice of the Thai People" radio station issued a commentary on March 6, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists and their South Vietnamese running dogs for their recent savage massacre of the people of South Vietnam. The commentary pointed out that the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, who have been beaten black and blue by the people and soldiers of South Vietnam, have recently carried out inhuman and frantic massacres of the people of South Vietnam, which is merely a sign of their desperate struggle. The commentary said that no matter how frantically the U.S. imperialists struggle, they cannot change their fate of failure. On the contrary, the more they frantically massacre the Vietnamese people, the deeper the hatred of the Vietnamese people will be, the more fiercely the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation will burn, and the faster their doomsday will come.

    “泰国人民之声”电台指出美帝越疯狂屠杀越失败得快
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会二月二十八日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义和南越卖国走狗集团野蛮轰炸、扫射越南南方西贡、顺化和其他城市，屠杀无辜人民的滔天罪行。
    声明指出，美帝国主义的这一野蛮和残暴的行动，证明了它正陷入被动挨打、惨重失败、惊惶失措和走投无路的困境，更加暴露了美帝国主义顽固、好战和侵略的本性。
    声明说，为了履行支持兄弟的越南南方人民的正义斗争的神圣义务，老挝爱国军民坚决进行斗争，粉碎美帝国主义扩大侵略老挝战争的一切阴谋，夺取更大的胜利。
    据新华社七日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台六日发表评论，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其南越走狗最近野蛮屠杀越南南方人民的滔天罪行。评论指出，被越南南方军民打得焦头烂额的美帝国主义及其走狗，最近对越南南方人民进行灭绝人性的疯狂屠杀，只不过是它们进行垂死挣扎的一种表现。评论说，美帝国主义不管它怎样疯狂挣扎，都无法改变它的失败命运。相反，它越是疯狂屠杀越南人民，就越加深越南人民的仇恨，使越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火烧得更旺，从而加速它的末日的到来。
