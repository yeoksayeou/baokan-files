Leaders of the Anshan Steel Works Intermediate Rolling Mill Revolutionary Committee, with the enthusiastic assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the factory to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, have stepped out of their offices and gone to the rolling mills to work with the workers to promote revolution and production. The picture shows Li Huimin (second from the right), the deputy director of the factory revolutionary committee who is an old worker, fighting tenaciously against the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois tendencies with the workers.
