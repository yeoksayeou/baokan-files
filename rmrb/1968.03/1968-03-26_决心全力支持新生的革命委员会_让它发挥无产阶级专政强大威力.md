The joyous news of the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Nanjing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has spread like a spring breeze throughout every corner of Jiangsu Province. In the past few days, revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres from all over Jiangsu have held grand meetings and various celebratory activities with hearts full of excitement. They enthusiastically hail the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial and Nanjing Municipal Revolutionary Committees as a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. People enthusiastically shout: "With all our hearts, we wish our great leader Chairman Mao a long, long life! Long, long life!"

The members of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Nanjing Municipal Revolutionary Committee recall with deep emotion the great leader Chairman Mao's affectionate care for the revolutionary people of Jiangsu. They say, after the establishment of the revolutionary committees, the most fundamental principle of all is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought well, and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This is an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao and a fundamental guarantee for holding and using power correctly. To quickly promote the thought revolutionization of the committee members and the revolutionary transformation of the leadership cadre, the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee has already organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class attended by all standing committee members. They are leading the way in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, further implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire province to new heights.

In this joyous day, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses from all over the province have reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Never forget class struggle." They say: studying Mao Zedong Thought and firmly grasping class struggle is the most important task for the revolutionary committees. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangsu, Jiang Yiqing and Chen Guang, along with a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and ghosts and snakes in society, will not readily accept their defeat. They will struggle desperately in their dying moments. In the current favorable situation, they will surely change their counter-revolutionary strategies and use various despicable means to sabotage the newly established revolutionary committees. Therefore, we must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to emphasize proletarian politics, always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen our unity with the great People's Liberation Army, maintain high revolutionary vigilance, and unite to fight the enemy. A responsible person from the Nanjing Workers' United Committee said: We, the working class, must, under the leadership of the newly established revolutionary committees, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly criticize and expose Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, along with their agents in Jiangsu, Jiang Yiqing and Chen Guang, politically, ideologically, and theoretically. We must thoroughly eliminate their poison in all fields. At the same time, we must firmly grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production, achieving greater victories to report to the great leader Chairman Mao.

The joyous news of the birth of the Jiangsu Provincial and Nanjing Municipal Revolutionary Committees has spread to the countryside, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are in high spirits. Metu, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said excitedly: Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply understand that the establishment of the proletarian revolutionary power is not easy. We must support, maintain, and consolidate the newly established revolutionary committees. The Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party want to usurp the proletarian power and restore capitalism, making us suffer twice and endure twice the hardships, which is absolutely impossible! We poor and lower-middle peasants will always follow Chairman Mao's words, always study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, initiate a high tide of revolutionary criticism and spring plowing, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Nanjing University, which recently established its revolutionary committee, is even more joyous and excited in these days. All revolutionary teachers and students unanimously expressed that they will strive to study, resolutely execute, actively propagate, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought. They will continue to consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, enhance proletarian party spirit, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois tendencies, overthrow anarchism, and overcome the erroneous tendencies of mountainism and sectarianism. On the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, they will strengthen unity and unite to fight the enemy.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the Nanjing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army enthusiastically hail the victorious birth of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and wholeheartedly support, safeguard, and defend the newly established revolutionary committees.

In recent days, the broad cadres and soldiers of the Nanjing Military Region have held celebratory activities for the victorious birth of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The cadres and soldiers say, the victorious birth of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee is another great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They enthusiastically shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao a long, long life!" The cadres and soldiers stationed on the eastern coast of the East China Sea, the front line of the Yellow Sea, and the south bank of the Yangtze River, who are executing the tasks of defending the motherland and "three supports, two militaries," excitedly say, the spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought blows red wherever it goes. Following Chairman Mao closely is victory, the closer we follow, the greater the victory. We will forever follow closely and forever be victorious. They unanimously expressed that they will forever be steadfast soldiers loyal to Chairman Mao, organize and conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and do the "three supports, two militaries" work even better.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." The broad cadres and soldiers unanimously believe that the establishment of the revolutionary committees is the result of the class struggle in the previous stage, not the end of class struggle. In the joyous day of celebrating the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Song Konguang, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a regiment commander of a certain unit, wrote an article enthusiastically praising the newly born revolutionary committees. He said, Jiangsu is a key city in southeastern China, and Nanjing was the center of the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary rule. After liberation, imperialism, the landlord class, the bourgeoisie, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, using Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Jiangsu, vigorously promoted the revisionist line and carried out counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracies. Now, they will not readily accept their defeat and will surely use various despicable and evil means to sabotage. We must always remember class struggle, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and launch a proactive attack on the class enemy. The cadres and soldiers of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The power obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." We must strengthen the consciousness of class struggle, heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, and thoroughly smash all the sabotage activities of the class enemy.

The broad cadres and soldiers guarding the coastal defense day and night express that the People's Liberation Army is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Defending the newly established revolutionary committees is the glorious mission entrusted to us by the great commander Chairman Mao. We must always keep a clear mind, be prepared for all battles, resolutely smash all sabotage activities of the class enemy, and defend the newly established revolutionary committees with our lives and blood.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the leadership organs of the Nanjing Military Region and units such as artillery, engineering, and armored forces have expressed in discussions that they will actively support, fully support, and respect the newly established revolutionary committees in all aspects, making the revolutionary committees truly become organs with proletarian revolutionary authority and exert the mighty power of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    江苏广大军民热烈欢呼毛泽东思想在我国东南重镇的伟大胜利
    决心全力支持新生的革命委员会
    让它发挥无产阶级专政强大威力
    新华社南京二十五日电　江苏省革命委员会和南京市革命委员会成立的喜讯，象春风一样吹遍了江苏省的每一个角落。这两天，江苏各地的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众怀着无比兴奋的心情，纷纷举行盛大集会和各种庆祝活动，热烈欢呼江苏省和南京市革委会的成立是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利。人们热烈欢呼：“最最衷心地祝愿我们的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    江苏省革命委员会和南京市革命委员会的委员们，以无比激动的心情回忆了伟大领袖毛主席对江苏省革命人民的亲切关怀。他们说，革委会成立以后，千条万条，最最根本的一条就是要学好、用好毛泽东思想，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。这是忠于毛主席的重要标志，也是掌好权、用好权的根本保证。为了迅速促进委员们的思想革命化和领导班子的革命化，江苏省革委会已经举办了由全体常委参加的毛泽东思想学习班，带头活学活用毛主席著作，进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把全省活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向新高潮。
    全省各地的广大无产阶级革命派在这大喜的日子里，重温了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导。他们说：学习毛泽东思想，狠抓阶级斗争，是革命委员会最重要的大事。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江苏的代理人江渭清、陈光之流以及一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派、社会上的牛鬼蛇神，决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作垂死的挣扎，在当前的大好形势下，他们必然会改变其反革命策略，利用各种卑鄙的手段，破坏新生的革命委员会。因此，我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力加强与伟大的人民解放军的团结，保持高度的革命警惕，共同对敌。南京工人大联委的负责人说：我们工人阶级，要在新生的革命委员会的领导下，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，高举革命的批判大旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在江苏的代理人江渭清、陈光之流，从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们在各个领域里的流毒。同时，我们还要狠抓革命、猛促生产，以更大的胜利，向伟大领袖毛主席报喜。
    江苏省和南京市革命委员会诞生的喜讯，传到全省农村，广大贫下中农和革命干部一片欢腾。学习毛主席著作积极分子顾阿桃激动地说：毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”我们贫下中农深深体会到，无产阶级革命政权的建立是不容易的。我们一定要支持、维护和巩固新生的革命委员会。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派，妄想篡夺无产阶级政权，复辟资本主义，让我们吃二遍苦，受二遍罪，这一千个办不到，一万个办不到！我们贫下中农要永远听毛主席的话，永远活学活用毛泽东思想，掀起革命大批判和春耕生产的高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    不久前成立了校革委会的南京大学，这几天更是欢欣鼓舞，喜上加喜。全校革命师生一致表示，一定要努力学习、坚决执行、积极宣传、勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，继续巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，增强无产阶级党性，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，打倒无政府主义，克服山头主义、宗派主义的错误倾向，在毛泽东思想的基础上加强团结，共同对敌。
    新华社南京二十五日电　人民解放军南京部队广大指战员，热烈欢呼江苏省革命委员会的胜利诞生。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全心全意地拥护、支持和保卫新生的革命委员会。
    南京部队的广大指战员，连日来纷纷为江苏省革命委员会的胜利诞生举行庆祝活动。指战员们说，江苏省革命委员会的胜利诞生，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利。他们纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
  “敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”正在东海之滨、黄海前哨和大江南北执行保卫祖国和“三支”“两军”任务的指战员，激动地说，毛泽东思想的春风，吹到哪里哪里红，紧跟毛主席就是胜利，跟得越紧，胜利越大，永远紧跟，永远胜利。他们一致表示，要永远做无限忠于毛主席的坚强战士，大办特办毛泽东思想学习班，进一步全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把“三支”“两军”工作做得好上加好。
    毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。广大指战员一致认为，革命委员会的建立，这是前一阶段阶级斗争的结果，而不是阶级斗争的结束。南京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部团长宋孔广在欢庆江苏省革命委员会成立的大喜日子里，写文章热烈歌颂新诞生的革命委员会。他说，江苏是我国东南重镇，南京曾是蒋匪帮反革命统治的中心。解放以后，帝国主义、地主阶级、资产阶级、国民党反动派，利用中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在江苏的代理人，竭力推行修正主义路线，进行反革命复辟的阴谋活动。现在，他们绝不会甘心于自己的失败，必然会不断利用各种卑鄙恶劣的手段，进行破坏。我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向阶级敌人主动进攻。“南京路上好八连”的指战员们说，毛主席教导我们：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”我们要加强阶级斗争观念，百倍地提高革命警惕，彻底地粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋破坏活动。
    日日夜夜守卫在海防前线的广大指战员表示，中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，捍卫新生的革命委员会，是伟大统帅毛主席赋予我们的光荣任务。我们要时刻保持清醒的头脑，做好一切战斗准备，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的一切破坏行动，用生命和鲜血保卫新生的革命委员会。
    南京部队领导机关和炮兵、工程兵、装甲兵等单位的广大干部战士，在座谈讨论中表示一定要积极拥护、全力支持、处处尊重新生的革命委员会，使革命委员会真正成为有无产阶级革命权威的机关，发挥出无产阶级专政的强大威力。
