We think of it every day, we long for it every day, hoping to see our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao. On March 7, this wish finally came true. The great leader Chairman Mao received us, and this is the greatest joy, the greatest happiness, and the greatest honor of our lives.

We faced the red sun, our blood boiling with excitement, our hearts surging with emotion, and all our words boiled down to one sentence: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao! A thousand songs and ten thousand melodies resound with the strongest notes of the times: Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Dear Chairman Mao, it is you who have shown us the direction forward. Your brilliant thoughts, like rain and sunlight, have nurtured us to grow strong. In the past, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, with China's Khrushchev at the helm, did not allow us to read your books and went to great lengths to obstruct the printing of your brilliant works. During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we followed your great teachings to "care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." We fought resolutely against China's Khrushchev and his accomplices, thoroughly smashing their evil plots to oppose the propagation of your brilliant thoughts. With our boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to you, we strive to study and apply your brilliant works, actively respond to your great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," rely on our own efforts, work hard, overcome numerous obstacles, and print large quantities of your red books, so that more people can be nurtured by your brilliant thoughts. In the more than a year of life-and-death struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, every victory we have achieved is a great victory of your brilliant thoughts.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your reception of us is the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, the greatest inspiration, and the greatest spur, adding boundless strength to us. In the triumphant songs of seizing the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we pledge to you: We will resolutely take Vice Chairman Lin as our shining example, forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and forever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line. We will read your books for a lifetime, print your books for a lifetime, and propagate your brilliant thoughts for a lifetime.

    我们天天想，日日盼，盼望能见到我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。三月七日这一天，这个愿望终于实现了。伟大领袖毛主席接见了我们，这是我们终生难忘的最大喜事，最大幸福，最大光荣。
    我们迎着红太阳，激动得热血沸腾，心潮澎湃，千言万语汇成一句话：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！千歌万曲响着时代的最强音：祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。敬爱的毛主席啊，是您老人家给我们指明了前进的方向，您的光辉思想的雨露阳光，哺育我们茁壮成长。过去，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派不让我们读您老人家的书，千方百计阻挠我们印制您老人家的光辉著作。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们遵照您老人家“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大教导，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，进行了坚决的斗争，彻底粉碎了他们反对宣传您的光辉思想的罪恶阴谋。我们凭着对您老人家的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚，努力活学活用您的光辉著作，积极响应您老人家“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，冲破重重阻力，战胜种种困难，大量印出了您的红色宝书，使更多的人受到您的光辉思想的哺育。在一年多来的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的生死搏斗中，我们所取得的每一个胜利，都是您的光辉思想的伟大胜利。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家的接见，是对我们最大的关怀、最大的鼓舞、最大的激励、最大的鞭策，给我们增添了无穷无尽的力量。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们向您宣誓：我们坚决以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于您，永远忠于您的伟大思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线。我们要一辈子读您的书，一辈子印您的书，一辈子宣传您的光辉思想。
