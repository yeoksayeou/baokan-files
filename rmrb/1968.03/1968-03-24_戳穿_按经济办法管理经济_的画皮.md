Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all work. Yet, the Chinese Khrushchev opposes emphasizing politics. The fallacy he advocates, "managing the economy with economic methods," is a counter-revolutionary revisionist lie that opposes emphasizing politics. This fallacy has deeply poisoned the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors. We must peel off its disguise, expose its true face, and thoroughly eliminate its poison.

The Malicious Intent Behind Advocating "Managing the Economy with Economic Methods"

Since the founding of the nation, there have been two fundamentally opposed lines on the economic front.

One is the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. This line emphasizes proletarian politics, strengthens the proletarian dictatorship, not only mechanizes but more importantly, revolutionizes, using revolutionization to lead mechanization, "grasp revolution, promote production." The other is the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, which only focuses on material construction, machinery, mechanization, and even material incentives.

The former line ensures that our socialist revolution and socialist construction continuously achieve victories and develop, that our proletarian state will never change color, and gradually develop from socialism to communism. The latter line leads down the capitalist road, step by step, and can only regress to the old path of semi-colonialism and colonialism.

It is under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line that the broad masses of laborers in our country have repeatedly repelled the attacks of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, achieving brilliant successes in socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The Chinese Khrushchev is unwilling to accept defeat and repeatedly changes tactics, using various methods to attack and disrupt Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The so-called "managing the economy with economic methods" is an arrow he has shot on the economic front.

Under the guise of "managing the economy with economic methods," he fiercely attacks the proletarian dictatorship's management agencies as "bureaucratic institutions," slandering our proletarian dictatorship's leadership of economic construction as "administrative methods," as "extra-economic methods." He viciously asks, "Why must it be managed by administrative methods and not by economic methods?"

Of course, managing the economy solely by administrative orders is not feasible, and no one has advocated this. However, the Chinese Khrushchev's attack on "administrative methods" is actually an attack on emphasizing politics, an attack on the rights of laborers to manage the state and enterprises. Compared to economics, politics must take the primary position. In any field (including the economic field), it is subordinate to a certain politics, and the leadership is always in the hands of a certain class. If proletarian politics are not emphasized, bourgeois politics will inevitably be emphasized; if the leadership is not in the hands of the proletariat, it will inevitably be in the hands of the bourgeoisie. The Chinese Khrushchev's attack on "administrative methods" and advocacy of "economic methods" is actually a opposition to emphasizing proletarian politics, a opposition to the proletarian dictatorship, and a opposition to running enterprises as schools of Mao Zedong Thought. He attempts to dissolve the socialist economy, weaken and overthrow the proletarian dictatorship, ultimately leading to the restoration of capitalism in China.

What is the "Economic Methods" Advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev?

What is the "economic method" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev? In short, it is the capitalist method of managing the economy. Listen to his confession:

He says: "Managing with administrative agencies is not as good as managing with enterprises. One must recognize this problem. How capitalists manage enterprises, how capitalists manage factories, they manage quite well." He also says, "We must learn from the experience of capitalist management of enterprises, especially the experience of monopolistic enterprises."

What capitalist methods of managing the economy does the Chinese Khrushchev admire?

First: Profit is the commander. He openly advocates that socialist enterprises should be like capitalist enterprises, seeking profit by any means necessary. He says, "A factory must make money; if it doesn't make money, it should close down and stop paying wages." To make money, factories can even engage in non-core businesses, disrupt the national unified plan. He openly says, "Factories in the past were too single-minded, not knowing how to engage in sideline businesses. ... The main business actually doesn't make much money, sideline businesses make money. 'This way, more money is made, more profits are made.'"

To say such words reeking of copper coins is truly disgusting and shameful.

Making money is indeed the purpose of capitalist economics. Marx said: Profit is the motive and decisive purpose of capitalism. Does this mean that we proletarians engage in revolution, construction, build factories, and run enterprises just to make money?

After the proletariat seizes power and engages in economic construction, the purpose is to develop the socialist economy, consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, carry the socialist revolution to the end, support the world people's revolution, and prepare conditions for gradually transitioning to communism. Socialist economic construction serves the politics of the proletariat. Managing the economy fundamentally, fundamentally, is to emphasize proletarian politics, emphasize Mao Zedong Thought. With proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought, it first ensures the socialist direction of the enterprise. Under the leadership of the national unified plan, the laboring people will consciously practice thrift in all endeavors, improve labor productivity, reduce costs, create more wealth, and increase more accumulation for the state.

If we follow the Chinese Khrushchev's words, an enterprise, for the sake of making money, can disrupt the national unified plan to engage in large-scale sideline businesses, disregard overall interests to seek personal gain, use any means necessary, and seek profit at all costs. Then, where is the socialism, where is the planned economy? Isn't it no different from a capitalist enterprise?

Second: Material incentives. The Chinese Khrushchev openly says, "Material incentives are still needed!" He also says, "Without adding some money, production enthusiasm is not enough, you won't produce well." Isn't this just a rehash of the exploitative class's "money can make the devil push the millstone"? Isn't this just what Lenin said, "Doing things for money—this is the morality of the capitalist world"?

Do our workers and peasants work just to make money? Workers and peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought have their hearts set on revolution and socialism. They link their labor to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, with their hearts in their motherland and their eyes on the world. The Chinese Khrushchev, with his soul tainted by the stench of copper coins, simply cannot understand the feelings of Chinese workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

The Chinese Khrushchev attempts to corrupt the masses with bourgeois selfishness, leading the broad masses of workers down the capitalist path, making people only think of making money, forgetting revolution, forgetting the distant ideal of communism, creating conditions for him to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and implement capitalist restoration. This is a soft knife that kills without blood!

Third: Handing over leadership to the bourgeoisie. The Chinese Khrushchev has always advocated relying on capitalists to engage in economic construction. He openly stands on the side of the capitalists and says, "How are the enterprises led by the Communist Party? Some capitalists don't believe it." He slanders the proletarian dictatorship's leadership of the economy as "managing with extra-economic methods, ... increasing bureaucracy." He shouts, "Administrative departments are not suitable for managing the economy. Administrative departments managing the economy will inevitably disrupt the economy. This problem has been solved in countries with highly developed monopoly capitalism." He also says, "Managing enterprises, the bourgeoisie has several hundred years of experience." Therefore, he advocates "learning from capitalist countries." In his view, economic construction can only rely on managers, experts, engineers, accountants, and economists, kicking workers to the side. He crazily promotes the economic management system of monopoly capitalism. In enterprises, he stubbornly insists on implementing the "one-man management" system and the reactionary "expert line." He also formulated a set of revisionist methods, regulations, rules, and systems, implementing bourgeois dictatorship over workers. He wants to hand over the leadership of the state economy and enterprises to the new and old bourgeois elements, creating conditions for him to seize the party and the state.

In summary, the Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "managing the economy with economic methods" is to follow the path of Soviet and Yugoslav revisionism, achieve enterprise liberalization, let enterprises freely compete for profits, disrupt the socialist planned economy, and at the same time use material incentives to poison the working class. He also hands over the management power of enterprises to new and old bourgeois elements, ultimately achieving the goal of restoring capitalism.

The matter is now clear. If we follow the Chinese Khrushchev's guidelines, socialist enterprises will become capitalist enterprises, and tomorrow's China will become today's Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. This is a very dangerous scenario!

We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, and turn our country's industrial and transportation enterprises into vibrant schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

    戳穿“按经济办法管理经济”的画皮
    国家经委无产阶级革命派
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂。政治工作是一切工作的生命线。而中国赫鲁晓夫却反对突出政治。他所鼓吹的“按经济办法管理经济”就是一个反对突出政治的反革命修正主义谬论。这个谬论在工交财贸各系统，流毒很深。我们必须剥开它的画皮，揭露它的真面目，彻底肃清它的流毒。
    鼓吹“按经济办法管理经济”的险恶用心
    建国以来，在我国经济战线上，一直存在着两条根本对立的路线。
    一条是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。这条路线，强调突出无产阶级政治，加强无产阶级专政，不仅搞机械化，更重要的是搞革命化，用革命化来领导机械化，“抓革命，促生产”。另一条是以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义路线，它只搞物质建设，搞机器，搞机械化，还搞什么物质刺激。
    前一条路线，是保证我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设不断取得胜利和发展，我国无产阶级江山永不变色、并逐步地由社会主义发展到共产主义的路线。后一条路线是沿着资本主义道路，一步一步滑下去，实际上只能倒退到半殖民地、殖民地的老路上去的路线。
    正是在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，我国广大劳动人民一次又一次地击退了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义路线的进攻，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的辉煌成就。
    中国赫鲁晓夫不甘心失败，一再改变战术，用各种办法来攻击和干扰毛主席的革命路线。所谓“按经济办法管理经济”，就是他在经济战线上射出的一支毒箭。
    他借“按经济办法管理经济”之名，竭力攻击无产阶级专政的管理机构“是官僚主义的机构”，污蔑我们无产阶级专政的国家领导经济建设的办法是“行政办法”，是“超经济的办法”。他恶狠狠地说：“为什么非按行政办法管理，不按经济办法管理？”
    当然，单靠行政命令的办法管理经济是不行的，谁也没有这样主张过。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫攻击“行政办法”，实际上是攻击突出政治，攻击劳动者管理国家和企业的权利。同经济比起来，政治不能不占首位，任何领域（当然包括经济领域在内）都是从属于一定的政治的，领导权总是为一定的阶级所掌握的。不突出无产阶级政治，就必然突出资产阶级政治；领导权不为无产阶级所掌握，就必然为资产阶级所掌握。中国赫鲁晓夫攻击“行政办法”，提倡“经济办法”，实际上是反对突出无产阶级政治，反对无产阶级专政，反对把企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校；企图瓦解社会主义经济，削弱和颠覆无产阶级专政，最后导致资本主义在中国复辟。
    “按经济办法管理经济”是什么货色？
    中国赫鲁晓夫所提倡的“经济办法”是什么货色呢？说穿了，就是资本主义管理经济的办法。请看他的自供：
    他说：“用行政机关管，不如用企业管，要认识这个问题。资本家怎样管企业，资本家管工厂，总算管得好的”。又说：“资本主义管理企业的经验，特别是垄断企业的经验要学习。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫所醉心的资本主义管理经济的办法又是什么呢？
    一曰：利润挂帅。他公然主张社会主义企业要象资本主义企业一样，唯利是图，不择手段地赚钱。他说：“一个工厂一定要赚钱，不赚钱就应关门，停发工资。”为了赚钱，工厂甚至可以不务正业，破坏国家统一计划，他公然说：“工厂过去太单打一，不知道搞副业，……正业其实不赚什么钱，副业赚钱。”“这样赚钱就多，利润就多了。”
    说出这种铜臭熏天的话，真是臭死了，丑死了。
    赚钱，的确是资本主义经济的目的。马克思说过：利润是资本主义的发动的动机和决定的目的。难道说，我们无产阶级干革命、搞建设、开工厂、办企业，也是为了赚钱吗？
    无产阶级夺取政权以后，进行经济建设的目的，是为了发展社会主义经济，巩固无产阶级专政，将社会主义革命进行到底，支援世界人民革命，并且为逐步向共产主义过渡准备条件。社会主义经济建设是为无产阶级的政治服务的。管理经济，根本的根本，就是必须突出无产阶级政治，突出毛泽东思想。有了无产阶级的政治，有了毛泽东思想，首先保证了企业的社会主义方向，劳动人民就会在国家统一计划的领导下，自觉地勤俭办一切事业，提高劳动生产率，降低成本，创造更多的财富，为国家增加更多的积累。
    如果照中国赫鲁晓夫的话去做，一个企业为了赚钱，可以破坏国家的统一计划去大搞副业，不顾整体利益去投机取巧，不择手段，唯利是图，那么，还有什么社会主义，还有什么计划经济，岂不是和资本主义企业没有两样了么？
    二曰：物质刺激。中国赫鲁晓夫公开说：“物质刺激还是要一点罗！”还说什么“不加点钱，生产积极性不够，不好好给你生产。”这不正是剥削阶级的“有钱能使鬼推磨”的再版吗？不正是列宁所说的“做事就是为了拿钱，——这是资本主义世界的道德”吗？
    难道说我们的工人和农民是为了赚钱才劳动的吗？用毛泽东思想武装起来的劳动人民，一心为革命，一心为社会主义。他们把自己从事的劳动和中国革命、世界革命联系起来，胸怀祖国，放眼世界。被铜臭染污了灵魂的中国赫鲁晓夫，根本没法理解用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人的心情。
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用资产阶级利己主义来腐蚀群众，把广大工人群众拉向资本主义的歧途，使人们只想赚钱，忘记革命，忘记共产主义的远大理想，为他颠覆无产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟创造条件。这是一把杀人不见血的软刀子！
    三曰：让资产阶级掌握领导权。中国赫鲁晓夫一向叫嚷要依靠资本家搞经济建设。他公然站在资本家的立场上说：“到底共产党领导的企业怎么样？有些资本家就不相信。”他污蔑无产阶级专政的国家对经济的领导是“用超经济办法管理，……增加了官僚主义。”他叫嚷“行政部门不适合管经济，行政部门管经济，势必把经济割断。这个问题在垄断资本主义高度发展的国家是解决了。”又说：“管企业，资产阶级有几百年的经验”。因此，他鼓吹“向资本主义国家学”。在他看来，搞经济建设只能依靠厂长、专家、工程师、会计师、经济师，把工人一脚踢开。他疯狂地推行垄断资本主义的经济管理体制。在企业里他顽固地坚持实行“一长制”和反动的“专家路线”，他还制定了一套修正主义的办法、条例、规章、制度，对工人实行资产阶级专政。他就是要把国家经济和企业的领导大权双手奉献给资产阶级，为他篡党篡国创造条件。
    总之，中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“用经济办法管理经济”，就是走苏联和南斯拉夫修正主义的道路，实现企业自由化，让企业和企业之间为争夺利润去自由竞争，破坏社会主义计划经济，同时用物质刺激的办法去毒害工人阶级，并且把企业管理大权交给新老资产阶级分子，最后达到复辟资本主义的目的。
    事情再清楚也没有了，照中国赫鲁晓夫的方针办理，社会主义的企业就会变成资本主义的企业，明日的中国就会变成今日的苏联和南斯拉夫，这是一种多么危险的情景啊！
    我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，强化无产阶级专政，把我国工业交通企业办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
