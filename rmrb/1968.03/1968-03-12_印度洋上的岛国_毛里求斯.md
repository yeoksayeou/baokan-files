		The island nation of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean declared independence on March 12. This is a victory achieved by the Mauritian people through their long struggle against colonial rule and for national independence.

		Mauritius is located in the southern Indian Ocean, over 2,200 kilometers from the eastern coast of Africa, with an area of over 2,000 square kilometers and a population of 789,000.

		As early as 1598 and 1715, Mauritius was successively occupied by Dutch and French colonizers. In 1810, it was seized by Britain and became a British colony.

		Mauritius is a volcanic island with fertile land. However, due to long-term colonial rule, Mauritius' economy has developed abnormally, becoming a single-crop economy. Mauritius' agriculture is mainly the cultivation of sugarcane, and its industry is almost entirely the sugar industry. The sugarcane plantations and enterprises are basically controlled by foreign colonizers. The fruits of the Mauritian people's hard work each year are largely expropriated by foreign colonizers.

		For a long time, the Mauritian people have suffered from the brutal oppression and exploitation of imperialism and colonialism, leading to a miserable life. They strongly demand independence. Under the immense pressure of the Mauritian people's struggle for independence, Britain was forced to agree in June 1961 to implement "internal self-government" in two phases for Mauritius, but it refused to specify the exact date for "internal self-government." Due to the surging African national liberation movement and the Mauritian people's persistent struggle, Mauritius achieved "internal self-government" in August 1967. At the same time, Britain was forced to agree to Mauritius' independence on March 12, 1968. After independence, Mauritius became a member of the Commonwealth.

		Imperialism and the old and new colonialists will never accept their defeat. The Mauritian people, who have long persisted in the struggle, will continue to fight to safeguard national independence. (Xinhua News Agency) (Accompanying picture)

### 印度洋上的岛国——毛里求斯

　　印度洋上的岛国——毛里求斯
    三月十二日，印度洋上的岛国毛里求斯宣告独立。这是毛里求斯人民进行长期反对殖民统治、争取民族独立斗争所取得的胜利。
    毛里求斯位于南印度洋上，距非洲东海岸二千二百多公里，面积二千余平方公里，人口为七十八万九千人。
    早在一五九八年和一七一五年，毛里求斯曾先后被荷兰和法国殖民者侵占，一八一○年又被英国占领，成为英国的殖民地。
    毛里求斯是个火山岛，土地肥沃。但由于长期殖民统治，造成毛里求斯的经济畸形发展，成为单一经济作物的国家。毛里求斯农业主要是种植甘蔗，工业也几乎都是制糖业。甘蔗种植园和企业基本上都操纵在外国殖民者手中。毛里求斯人民每年辛勤劳动的成果，大部分被外国殖民者剥夺去了。
    长期以来，毛里求斯人民身受帝国主义和殖民主义的残酷压迫和剥削，生活非常痛苦，强烈要求独立。在毛里求斯人民争取独立斗争的强大压力下，英国被迫于一九六一年六月同意毛里求斯分两阶段实行“内部自治”，但是一直拒绝规定“内部自治”的具体日期。由于非洲民族解放运动日益高涨和毛里求斯人民的坚持斗争，一九六七年八月毛里求斯实现“内部自治”，同时英国被迫同意毛里求斯于一九六八年三月十二日独立。独立后的毛里求斯成为英联邦成员国。
    帝国主义和新老殖民主义者绝不会甘心自己的失败。长期坚持斗争的毛里求斯人民，必将继续为维护民族独立而斗争。（新华社）（附图片）
