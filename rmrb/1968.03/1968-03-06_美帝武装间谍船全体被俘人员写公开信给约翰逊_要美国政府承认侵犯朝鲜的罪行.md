The crew of the U.S. armed spy ship "Pueblo," all 82 members, who were captured by the Korean People's Army naval vessels, wrote an open letter to U.S. President Johnson on February 29, demanding that the U.S. government admit to the crime of the "Pueblo" invading Korean territorial waters for spy activities.

The open letter states: "We are all members of the U.S. armed forces or the Department of Defense."

"The mission of the U.S. 'Pueblo' was to conduct electronic espionage, and it was equipped with a highly trained team for this purpose."

"We acted under the orders of the Commander of the U.S. Navy in Japan, our operational commander, which were formal orders from the U.S. Navy. These orders were approved and endorsed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of Naval Operations."

The open letter admits that the U.S. armed spy ship "Pueblo," "for the purpose of obtaining intelligence through electronic and visual means," "invaded the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."

The open letter states: "According to the orders we received, we concentrated on collecting intelligence in the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea near the ports of Chungjin, Chonjin, Mayangdo, and Wonsan for ten days. We detected electronic waves in the surrounding area, focusing on collecting various intelligence about the Korean People's Army Navy, and intercepted and located radar sites along the coast. We also intercepted communications and reconnoitered shore-based observation posts and military targets. We were captured while conducting hostile activities near Yonpo, 7.6 miles from Rido Island, in the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on January 23, 1968."

The open letter states: "Since the Korean People's Army has obtained documents exposing the true purpose of our work and evidence proving that our ship's position, navigation log, and navigation charts invaded the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, we can no longer deny the facts."

The open letter demands that the U.S. government admit to the fact that the "Pueblo" "invaded the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and conducted hostile activities," "apologize for these actions, and guarantee not to repeat them."

The open letter states: "The espionage activities we conducted were an unlawful infringement on the sovereignty of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."

"The evidence confirming that the 'Pueblo' invaded the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its espionage activities is conclusive and irrefutable."

    美帝武装间谍船全体被俘人员写公开信给约翰逊
    要美国政府承认侵犯朝鲜的罪行
    新华社五日讯　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，被朝鲜人民军海军舰艇俘获的美帝国主义武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”全体八十二名人员，二月二十九日向美国总统约翰逊写公开信，要求美国政府承认“普韦布洛号”侵入朝鲜领海从事间谍活动的罪行。
    公开信说：“我们都是美国武装部队或国防部的人员。”
      “美国‘普韦布洛号’的目的和任务是从事利用电子的间谍活动，并派有在这方面受过高度训练的一队人员。”
      “我们是根据驻日海军司令，我们的行动司令，向我们发布的美国海军的正式命令采取行动的。我们的命令是得到参谋长联席会议和海军作战部部长的赞同和批准的。”
    公开信供认，美国武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”“为了获得利用电子和视力得到的情报”，“侵入了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领海”。
    公开信说：“根据我们得到的命令，我们在十天里，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海内清津、城津、马养岛和元山四个港口的附近集中进行收集情报的活动。我们探测了周围的电子波，重点是收集关于朝鲜人民军海军的种种情报，并在沿海一带截听和找出雷达所在地。我们还截取了通讯，并侦察了岸上的观察站和军事目标。我们是在一九六八年一月二十三日在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海内元山附近距丽岛七点六英里处从事敌对行动时被俘的。”
    公开信说：“由于朝鲜人民军已得到了暴露我们工作的真正目的的文件和证明我们侵入了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海的船的位置、航海日记和航海图，我们就无法再否认事实了。”
    公开信要求美国政府承认“普韦布洛号”“侵入了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领海并从事敌对活动的事实”，“为这些行动道歉并保证不再重犯这些行动”。
    公开信说：“我们所从事的这种间谍活动是不正当地侵犯了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的主权。”
    “证实‘普韦布洛号’侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海及其间谍行动的证据是确凿的和不容反驳的。”
