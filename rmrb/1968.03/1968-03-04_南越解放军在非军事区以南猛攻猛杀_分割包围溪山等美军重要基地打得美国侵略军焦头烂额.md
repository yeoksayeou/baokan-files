The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has been launching fierce attacks south of the demilitarized zone, surrounding and dividing key U.S. bases such as Khe Sanh, Dong Ha, and Cam Lo along Route 9. These bases have been repeatedly subjected to intense assaults by the Liberation Army, leaving the American aggressors in a state of panic and disarray.

In recent days, the Liberation Army has not only continuously bombarded Khe Sanh base but also launched a ground assault on March 1st. Liberation Army soldiers bravely charged to the front lines of the base, annihilating the enemy. A camp of puppet soldiers defending the east side of the base was wiped out, with over seventy casualties. As the Liberation Army's encirclement tightens, no U.S. patrol teams have dared to venture out since a patrol was decimated on February 26th. The American aggressors have been huddled in their fortifications, too scared to step out, and have been frantically digging deeper trenches in a desperate attempt to save their lives. The Khe Sanh airfield, frequently under heavy bombardment, is also within the range of the Liberation Army's small arms fire, making it increasingly dangerous for enemy planes to land. On March 1st, a U.S. transport plane attempting to take off was shot down by a Liberation Army sniper before it could leave the runway, bursting into flames.

The U.S. bases at Carol Camp, Dong Ha, and Cam Lo to the northeast of Khe Sanh have also been under constant attack. The Liberation Army has been highly active around Dong Ha, cutting off the roads from Hue and Quang Tri to Dong Ha for several weeks. The U.S. forces in Dong Ha rely on air and water transport, but the airfield is frequently bombarded, and enemy supply ships on the Thu Bon River are often attacked. On February 29th, two supply convoys were heavily struck by the Liberation Army. The U.S. artillery positions at Dong Ha and Cam Lo have been under continuous heavy shelling, and patrolling U.S. troops have been repeatedly ambushed. On March 1st, the Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on a U.S. unit in a nearby village, killing and wounding over a hundred American soldiers.

At Carol Camp, the U.S. forces, like those at Khe Sanh, are hiding in underground bunkers, taking constant beatings but too afraid to retaliate for fear of provoking even more intense attacks from the Liberation Army. The commander of the U.S. Marine Corps' 4th Regiment at Carol Camp admitted that the Liberation Army holds the initiative. He lamented, "They (the Liberation Army) are now much closer and much stronger." He said, "They can definitely attack any of our positions."

On March 1st, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army launched a fierce artillery barrage on the Khe Sanh U.S. base's airfield, delivering a severe punishment to the American invaders. The image shows a U.S. plane attempting to flee, which was shot down before it could take off.

    南越解放军在非军事区以南猛攻猛杀
    分割包围溪山等美军重要基地打得美国侵略军焦头烂额
    新华社河内二日电被越南南方人民解放武装力量分割包围的非军事区以南九号公路沿线的溪山、东河、昆天等美军重要基地，连日来频频遭到人民解放武装力量的猛烈袭击。困守在这些基地内的美国侵略军被打得焦头烂额，日子越来越不好过。
    近几天来，人民解放武装力量不仅接连猛烈炮轰溪山基地，三月一日又一次对这个基地发动地面袭击，解放军战士们勇猛地冲到这个基地的前沿阵地消灭敌人。防守基地东边的一营伪军就被打死七十多人。由于人民解放武装力量的包围圈日益缩小，自从二月二十六日一个美军巡逻队被打得落花流水以后，美军指挥官再也不敢派出巡逻队了。这些美国侵略军整天龟缩在工事里，不敢离开防圈一步，并且每天拚命地把工事挖得更深一些，企图用这种办法来保住狗命。溪山机场不仅经常遭到猛烈的炮轰，而且还处在解放军战士轻武器的射程内，因此，胆敢飞到这个基地降落的敌机越来越少了。三月一日，一架美国运输机企图起飞逃跑，还未离开跑道就被解放军的神炮手击中，起火燃烧。
    溪山东北的卡罗尔营、东河、昆天等美军重要基地，也象溪山一样，天天挨打。人民解放武装力量在东河周围非常活跃，从顺化、广治通往东河的公路，已被人民解放武装力量切断了几周，东河基地的美军也只能依靠空运和水路运输，但是机场也经常遭到猛烈炮轰，越门河上的敌军运输船队频频遭到袭击。二月二十九日，又有两支船队遭到人民解放武装力量的猛烈袭击。东河和昆天的美国炮兵阵地近几天来不断遭到人民解放武装力量猛烈炮火的轰击，外出巡逻的美军也不断挨打。三月一日，人民解放武装力量在东河附近的一个村庄痛击美国侵略军，打死打伤美军一百多人。
    在卡罗尔营，困守这个营地的美军象溪山的守军一样，象鼹鼠一样钻在地洞里天天挨打，但是因为害怕招来人民解放武装力量更猛烈的打击，不敢还手。这个营地的美国海军陆战队第四团团长也不得不承认，人民解放武装力量稳操主动权。他哀叹，人民解放武装力量“现在要近得多了，并且强大得多了”。他说，“他们（指人民解放武装力量）肯定能够进攻我们的任何一个据点”。（附图片）
    三月一日，越南南方人民解放武装力量猛烈炮轰溪山美军基地的飞机场，给予美国强盗严厉的惩罚。图为一架企图逃命的美国强盗飞机，还没有来得及“升天”，就呜呼哀哉了。　新华社发（传真照片）
