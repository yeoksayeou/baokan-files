The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau, with their deep class feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, carry forward the high sense of revolutionary responsibility of the working class. Under the strong assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the bureau, they have ensured the successful completion of the task of safe power supply in the capital. They have ensured the power supply for Chairman Mao's eight receptions of Red Guard cadres, the power supply for festivals and various political meetings, and the power supply for industrial and agricultural production, municipal transportation, and the lives of the people in the capital. In the face of two typhoons that caused malfunctions, the malfunction rate in 1967 was reduced by 9.8% compared to 1966. With a fearless spirit of daring to revolutionize and innovate, they have basically realized the mechanization of digging pits and erecting poles, implemented comprehensive live-line operations, and promoted multiple innovation projects such as explosive line splicing, significantly improving the level of power supply work.

The boundless love for Chairman Mao ignites the workers' high sense of responsibility.

Beijing is the heart of the motherland, the center of the world revolution, and the place where our red sun, Chairman Mao, and the Party Central Committee reside. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau understand that ensuring the safe power supply in Beijing is to protect Chairman Mao, to protect the Party Central Committee, to protect the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to support the struggle of the revolutionary people of the world.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau deeply feel the honor of their mission and the weight of their responsibility. They know that every piece of work, if slightly neglected, even a small problem in a circuit or a minor fault in a transformer, will affect the overall situation and damage the prestige of Chairman Mao. Therefore, they treat every piece of work and every political task with utmost seriousness, diligence, and meticulousness. They say: "In front of Chairman Mao, not a single light bulb can be unlit; spreading Chairman Mao's voice cannot allow any interference." Chairman Mao's prestige organizes their actions. Before the National Day last year, to ensure Chairman Mao's inspection of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution army, they inspected and repaired every pole and every light bulb along the 50-li route from the airport to the welcoming hall, leaving no small problem unattended.

In the past year, amidst the stormy class struggle, although they were divided into several different factions with various viewpoints, they always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production" and spared no effort to ensure the safe power supply in the capital. Even at the height of the struggle, they never forgot the heavy responsibility on their shoulders. Some workers would still argue before work and continue their debates after work, but when it came to work, they were fully focused and meticulous.

A revolutionary leadership team leads the workers.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Once the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." A strong leadership team with proletarian authority is necessary to better command the working-class forces.

The power supply bureau is a large enterprise with over 3,000 workers, with organizational structures scattered in over a hundred places within and outside the city, and a long, non-fixed work line. This requires strengthening unified command and high concentration; otherwise, a single link that is not flexible will cause a chain reaction: lights will not shine, broadcasts will be interrupted, telegrams will not be sent, machines will stop running, and trams will stop moving. The stationed People's Liberation Army comrades deeply understand the importance of the leadership team. They have always adhered to the principle of "supporting the left without supporting factions" and focused on building the leadership team.

Before the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, the remnants of the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev had not been completely eliminated. Some work teams had not correctly treated the team leaders, causing them to step aside. Therefore, in some departments, there were brief periods of command failure. After the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, they addressed this situation by repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "grasp revolution, promote production" with the revolutionary workers, repeatedly publicizing the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country," and repeatedly publicizing the "Sixteen Points." They criticized the bourgeois reactionary line with the masses, distinguished between two types of contradictions, and eliminated some of the estrangement between workers and team leaders.

The People's Liberation Army also continuously educated the cadres, helping them correctly treat themselves and correctly treat the masses. To ensure the safe power supply in the capital, they encouraged them to dare to take responsibility and bravely shoulder heavy burdens.

Through extensive ideological and political work and full consultation among various mass organizations, the bureau's production first-line command department, consisting of representatives from various factions, representatives from the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres, was quickly established on April 1st last year. Various factories and departments also established production leadership groups. This team enjoys high prestige among the masses. Once a task is assigned, regardless of which faction the masses belong to, they generally say "do it" and do it. Most team leaders have firmly guarded their posts and taken their work seriously.

In September last year, the entire bureau achieved revolutionary great unity, and in December, it achieved revolutionary three-in-one combination, establishing the Beijing Power Supply Bureau Revolutionary Committee. The establishment of this revolutionary, representative, and proletarian-authoritative provisional power organ has more powerfully commanded the revolutionary workers of the entire bureau to grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production.

The exemplary actions of old workers inspire young workers.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau have become even stronger. They not only follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment but also always use whether they can ensure the safe power supply in the capital as a test of their loyalty to Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line. Especially the old workers, they embody their sincere loyalty to Chairman Mao in every action.

On a day in mid-July last year, Beijing suddenly experienced a level 7 or 8 typhoon. That day was the rest day for the power supply bureau workers. As soon as they heard the wind, many people, without waiting for instructions, rushed to the bureau. Whether they were line workers, repair workers, or drivers, whether it was within their scope of duty or unrelated to their work, the wind was the command, and the site of the accident was their battlefield. They took their tools and rushed to the scene to fight. Some repaired one place and then rushed to another, fighting continuously. After completing their tasks, they returned to the bureau, ready to be dispatched at any time. In three days, they handled hundreds of accidents that would normally take half a month to complete. Many old workers worked continuously for over 30 hours, still full of spirit and fighting spirit.

The comrades of the People's Liberation Army have always paid attention to the exemplary role of old workers, using the exemplary deeds of old workers to influence and educate the majority of young workers. In addition to praising the serious and responsible work spirit of old workers in large and small meetings and calling on young workers to learn from old workers, they also encouraged old workers to use their personal experiences to conduct class education for young workers.

The old workers of the power supply bureau have been working diligently and silently for over a decade. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have continuously used their bitter past to educate the younger generation to cherish today's happy life. When some young workers were unwilling to work on Sundays, old workers educated them to think from the overall situation and to consider that when other factories are resting, it is a good opportunity for us to maintain, so as not to affect the normal production of other factories and not to cause losses to the state. When some young workers were unwilling to do dirty and hard work, old workers told them the tragic history of the working class before liberation and educated young workers: "Chairman Mao liberated us, and we, the working class, became the masters of the state. What does it mean to be the masters? Being the masters is reflected in work, which is to work enthusiastically and creatively, and to work diligently and conscientiously."

The exemplary actions and heartfelt advice of old workers have had a positive impact on many young workers. The exemplary actions of old workers have inspired young workers.

Mao Zedong Thought unifies the workers' understanding.

Why have the revolutionary workers of the power supply bureau achieved such great results in the battle of "grasp revolution, promote production"? Why have they been so conscious of observing labor discipline and guarding their production posts in their work? Is it that the anarchist trend has had no interference on the power supply bureau? No, the power supply bureau is not a vacuum. Various trends in society are constantly impacting them, and various anarchist phenomena have also appeared in the power supply bureau. However, the comrades of the People's Liberation Army have always put politics in command, always doing ideological and political work in advance, using Mao Zedong Thought to raise the workers' awareness, helping them continuously overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and consciously resist the influence of anarchist trends.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." As soon as the People's Liberation Army entered the bureau, they brought the good experience and tradition of the People's Liberation Army's active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works to the bureau, organizing the majority of workers to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. So far, they have held 56 study classes, with 3,700 people participating in the study classes. In the study classes, they strive to carry forward the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, learning one point and applying one point, learning one sentence and applying one sentence, combining learning with application, and seeing immediate results.

The revolutionary workers of the power supply bureau use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions, use Mao Zedong Thought to check their work, use Mao Zedong Thought to summarize their experiences, and have produced many advanced deeds of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. Many work teams have formed a new communist style of mutual modesty in the face of achievements and mutual responsibility in the face of minor problems.

Now, a mass movement of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works has been launched in the Beijing Power Supply Bureau. They learn when accepting tasks, learn when encountering difficulties, learn when problems arise, and learn when achievements are made; they learn at home and also learn when on duty outside. This is how they use Mao Zedong Thought to unify their understanding and use Mao Zedong Thought to command their battles.

　　保证毛主席身边的盏盏电灯大放光明
　　保证毛主席的声音传遍全中国全世界
　　——记北京供电局广大革命职工抓革命促生产坚守岗位不断提高供电水平的事迹
    北京供电局广大革命职工，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，发扬工人阶级高度的革命责任感，在驻局支左的解放军同志大力帮助下，确保首都安全供电任务的胜利进行。他们保证了毛主席八次接见红卫兵小将时的用电，保证了节日和各种政治会议的用电，保证了首都工农业生产、市政交通和市民生活的用电。在两次风灾造成故障的情况下，一九六七年故障率比一九六六年仍降低了百分之九点八。他们以敢于革命、敢于创造的大无畏的气概，基本上实现了挖坑、立电杆的机械化施工，实行了综合带电作业，推广了爆破压接导线等多种革新项目，使供电工作的水平提高了一大步。
    对毛主席的无限热爱激发职工高度的责任感
    北京是祖国的心脏，是世界革命的中心，是我们心中的红太阳毛主席和党中央居住的地方。供电局的广大革命职工认识到：确保北京安全用电，就是保卫毛主席，就是保卫党中央，就是保卫无产阶级文化大革命，就是支援世界革命人民的斗争。
    北京供电局的广大革命职工深深感到自己任务的光荣，责任的重大。他们知道，每个人的工作，只要稍一疏忽，即使一条线路出了一点毛病，一个变压器有了一点故障，都会影响全局，都会影响毛主席的崇高威望。所以，他们对待每一件工作、每一项政治任务，都是那么认真负责，兢兢业业，一丝不苟。他们说：“在毛主席的面前，不能有一盏灯不亮；传播毛主席的声音，不能允许受到一点干扰。”毛主席的崇高威望把他们的行动组织起来。去年国庆节前夕，为了保证毛主席检阅无产阶级文化革命大军，他们对东起机场、西到迎宾馆长达五十里路上的一根根电杆、一个个灯泡，都进行了检修，一点小毛病都不放过。
    在过去的一年里，在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中，尽管他们内部分成几派不同的组织，存在着许多不同的观点，但是，他们始终牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，全力保证首都的安全用电。就是在斗争最激烈的时候，他们一刻也没有忘记自己身上担子的重大。有些工人上班前还在争论，下班后继续辩论，但干起活来却全神贯注，一丝不苟。
    革命的领导班子把职工率领起来
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”必须有一个坚强的有无产阶级权威的领导班子，才能指挥工人阶级队伍更好地战斗。
    供电局是一个有三千多职工的大企业，组织机构分散在城区内外上百个地方，工作战线很长，又不固定。这就要求加强统一指挥，要求高度集中，否则，一个环节调动不灵，就会引起连锁反应：电灯就会不亮，广播就会中断，电讯就会发不出去，机器就会停止转动，电车就会止步不前。支左的解放军同志深深懂得领导班子的重要性，他们始终坚持“支左不支派”的原则，狠抓领导班子的建设。
    解放军进局前，中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的流毒还没有肃清，一部分班组，没有正确地对待班组长，让他们靠边站了。因而在个别部门，在短暂的时间内出现了指挥失灵的现象。解放军进局后，针对这种情况，和广大革命职工反复学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，反复宣传《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，反复宣传“十六条”。他们和大家一起批判资产阶级反动路线，分清两种不同性质的矛盾，消除了一些工人和班组长之间的隔阂。
    解放军还不断地对干部进行教育，帮助他们正确对待自己，正确对待群众。为了保证首都安全供电，鼓舞他们要敢于负责，勇于挑重担子。
    通过大量的思想政治工作，通过各群众组织充分协商，去年四月一日，一个有各派群众组织代表、有解放军代表、有革命的领导干部参加的局生产第一线指挥部迅速建立起来了。各厂、处也建立了生产领导小组。这个班子在群众当中有较高的威信，只要布置任务，不管是哪一派的群众，大都是说干就干。绝大多数班组长都坚守岗位，认真负责工作。
    去年九月份，全局实现了革命的大联合，十二月份，实现了革命的三结合，成立了北京供电局革命委员会。这个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构的建立，更有力地指挥着全局广大革命职工狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    老工人的模范行动把青年职工带动起来
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，北京供电局的广大革命职工锻炼得更加坚强了。他们不仅紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，而且时时把能不能保证首都安全供电，作为考验自己是否忠于毛主席，是否忠于毛主席革命路线的标志。特别是老工人，他们把对毛主席的一片赤胆忠心，落实在自己的每一个行动中。
    去年七月中旬的一天，北京忽然刮起了七八级大风。那天正是供电局职工的休息日。一听到风声，很多人没有等通知，就不约而同地赶到局里。不管是线路工人，修配工人，还是汽车司机，不管是自己的职责范围，还是与自己毫无关系的作业内容，风声就是命令，发生事故的地点，就是自己的战场。他们纷纷拿起工具，奔赴现场，进行战斗。有的修好一处，又赶到另一处，连续不断地战斗。有的完成了任务以后，又回到局里，随时待命出发。三天之内，他们处理了在通常情况下需要半个月才能完成的数百起事故。许多老工人连续工作三十多个小时，仍然精神焕发，斗志昂扬。
    解放军同志始终注意发挥老工人的模范作用，用老工人的模范事迹去影响和教育广大的青年工人。他们除了在大会、小会表扬老工人认真负责的工作精神，号召青年工人向老工人学习外，还注意启发老工人用自己的亲身经历，对青年工人进行阶级教育。
    供电局的老工人，十几年来，总是那样勤勤恳恳、不声不响地工作着。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们不断地用自己辛酸的过去，教育青年一代珍惜今天的幸福生活。当有的青年工人不愿意在星期天干活的时候，老工人就教育他们，要从全局出发，要想到其他工厂休息的时候，正是我们检修的好机会，这样，就不会影响其他工厂的正常生产，就不会给国家带来损失。当有的青年工人不愿干脏活、累活的时候，老工人就给他们讲工人阶级解放以前当牛做马的悲惨历史，并教育青年工人说：“毛主席解放了我们，我们工人阶级才当了国家的主人。什么叫当家作主？当家作主体现在工作上，就是意气风发地创造性地干，就是兢兢业业地埋头苦干。”
    老工人的模范行动，语重心长的劝告，在很多青年工人身上发生了积极作用。老工人的模范行动把青年工人带动起来了。
    毛泽东思想把职工的认识统一起来
    供电局的广大革命职工，在“抓革命，促生产”的战斗中为什么能取得这样大的成绩？在工作中为什么能那样自觉地遵守劳动纪律，坚守生产岗位？难道无政府主义思潮对供电局就没有任何干扰？不是的。供电局并不是一个真空，社会上的各种思潮也随时在冲击着他们，在供电局里也曾经出现过无政府主义的各种现象。但是，解放军同志处处政治挂帅，时时把思想政治工作做在前边，用毛泽东思想去提高工人们的认识，帮助他们不断地克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，帮助他们自觉地抵制无政府主义思潮的影响。
    毛主席教导我们说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”解放军一进局就把解放军活学活用毛主席著作的好经验、好传统带到局里来，组织广大职工活学活用毛主席著作，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。到目前为止，他们已经办了五十六期学习班，有三千七百多人次参加了学习班的学习。他们在学习班里，努力发扬毛主席倡导的革命好学风，学一条，用一条，学一句，用一句，学用结合，立竿见影。
    供电局的广大革命职工用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动，用毛泽东思想来检查自己的工作，用毛泽东思想总结自己的经验，出现了许多活学活用毛主席著作的先进事迹。很多班组形成了一种有了成绩互相推让，出现一点毛病互相争担责任的共产主义新风尚。
    现在，一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，已经在北京供电局开展起来了。他们接受任务学，遇到困难学，出现问题学，取得成绩学；在家里学，外出执勤也学。他们就是这样，用毛泽东思想统一自己的认识，用毛泽东思想指挥自己战斗。
