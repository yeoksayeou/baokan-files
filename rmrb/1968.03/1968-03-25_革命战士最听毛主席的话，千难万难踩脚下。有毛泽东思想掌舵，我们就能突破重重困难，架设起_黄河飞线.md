Revolutionary soldiers follow Chairman Mao's words, and no matter how difficult, they trample it underfoot. With Mao Zedong Thought as our helm, we can break through all obstacles and build the Yellow River cable.

In 1965, our unit was ordered to build a certain Yellow River cable. This task required us to build two cables, each spanning one kilometer, across the surging Yellow River and between two steep mountains. Building such long cables in such a treacherous place was a daunting task. Most of the comrades participating in the construction were young soldiers who had only recently enlisted and were unfamiliar with the technology of cable construction. Completing this task was indeed very challenging. However, the red communications soldiers, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have no difficulties that cannot be overcome. As soon as we arrived at the construction site, we focused on actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, launching the "Infinitely Loyal to Chairman Mao" campaign. We regarded the quick completion of the Yellow River cable as a concrete expression of our infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao. Comrades proudly declared: Revolutionary soldiers have firm wills, and the Yellow River's dangers are nothing to us. Building cables for Chairman Mao, we are willing to sacrifice and shed blood!

The most difficult part of building cables over the Yellow River was pulling the cable across the river. Lacking experience, we mobilized the masses to think of solutions, with everyone contributing ideas and suggestions, proposing dozens of plans. After multiple trials, we overcame numerous technical difficulties and finally found a method of pulling and guiding the cable with a wooden boat.

However, this section of the Yellow River is between two mountains, with a large drop, fast currents, and many rocks. The local people have a saying: "When the boat reaches the mouth of the river, it's like walking through hell; you have to be willing to risk your life to navigate the boat!" Those days, it happened to be the rainy season upstream, with the river swelling, strong winds howling, and turbulent waves. What should we do? Should we wait for the Yellow River to recede before pulling the cable across, or should we pull the cable across immediately? To complete the combat mission given to us by Chairman Mao as soon as possible, everyone advocated pulling the cable across immediately. Comrades volunteered to take on this dangerous task. They said: For Chairman Mao, we go where it is most perilous! The poor and lower-middle peasants living by the Yellow River also provided strong support, serving as our consultants, giving us advice, and personally rowing and steering the boat for us.

The first attempt to cross the river began. Platoon leader Zhao Hecheng, along with five soldiers and four boatmen, boarded the wooden boat and headed into the river against the strong currents. The boat carried an iron wire, swaying in the rapids. With great difficulty, they reached the middle of the river. Due to the wire reel releasing the wire too quickly, the iron wire fell into the water and got caught on the rocks. The current pulled the wire, causing the wooden boat to rock violently. We had no choice but to cut the iron wire and return to the shore.

To prevent the wire from falling into the water, we modified the wire reel on the boat and attempted to cross the river again. When the boat reached the middle of the river, the wire suddenly got stuck on the reel, and the reel couldn't turn. In the rapids, the wooden boat was pulled sharply by the wire, listing heavily. Giant waves crashed into the boat, and it was in imminent danger of capsizing. We had no choice but to cut the wire again. The wooden boat was carried downstream before finally reaching the shore.

At this time, the sun was about to set. Platoon leader Zhao Hecheng was injured but insisted on staying on the front line. He led everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "struggle, failure, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory." Comrades said: "The task given to us by Chairman Mao is not yet completed, how can we go back?" Everyone volunteered to continue crossing the river to pull the wire. Squad leader Guo Faping hung Chairman Mao's portrait at the bow of the boat, filled with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Mao, and excitedly told the comrades: "With the great helmsman Mao Zedong guiding us, we can overcome any difficulty!" Comrades recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "With determination, fearlessness of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Learning from the experiences and lessons of the previous two attempts, after a fierce struggle, we finally successfully pulled the wire across the Yellow River. At that moment, shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed, drowning out the roar of the Yellow River's waves.

The two cables were quickly suspended between the steep mountains on both sides of the Yellow River. Summarizing this battle of building the Yellow River cable, comrades sang with revolutionary fervor: People say the Yellow River is dangerous, but we say there's no danger; revolutionary soldiers follow Chairman Mao's words, and no matter how difficult, they trample it underfoot.

    革命战士最听毛主席的话，千难万难踩脚下。有毛泽东思想掌舵，我们就能突破重重困难，架设起——
    黄河飞线
    通信兵某部十二连
    一九六五年，我们连奉命架设某地黄河飞线。这项任务，要求在波涛滚滚的黄河上面，在两座陡峭的高山之间，架设起跨距长达一千米的两道飞线。在这样险峻的地方，架设这么长跨距的飞线，工程是很艰巨的。我们参加施工的同志，大部分又是入伍时间不长，不熟悉架设技术的年轻战士。要完成这个任务，困难确实很大。然而，无限忠于毛主席的红色通信兵，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装了头脑，就没有不能克服的困难。一到工地，我们就大抓活学活用毛主席著作，开展“无限忠于毛主席”的活动，把尽快地架好黄河飞线，当作是无限忠于毛主席的具体表现。同志们豪迈地说：革命战士意志坚，黄河天险只等闲。为毛主席架飞线，牺牲流血也心甘！
    在黄河上架设飞线，最困难的，是把电线拉过河去。我们缺乏经验，就发动群众想办法，人人献计献策，提出了几十个建议。经过多次试验，突破重重技术难关，终于找到了一种引线牵引吊滑放线法，并且决定用木船把引线放过河去。
    可是，这一段黄河处在两山之间，落差大，水流急，礁石多。当地群众流传这样的歌谣：“船到××口，如从地狱走；舍得一条命，才敢把船行！”那几天，偏偏赶上上游暴雨，河水猛涨，狂风呼啸，浊浪翻滚。怎么办？是等待黄河落水后放线过河，还是立即放线过河？为了早日完成毛主席交给我们的战斗任务，大家主张立即放线过河。同志们争着要去完成这个危险的任务。他们说：为毛主席架线，那里最艰险，我们就到那里去！住在黄河岸边的贫下中农，也大力支援，给我们当参谋，出主意，亲自为我们划船掌舵。
    第一次抢渡开始了，排长赵和成带着五名战士，四名船工，跳上木船，迎着急浪，驶向河心。木船上牵着一条铁线，在激流中飘摇前进。好不容易驶到河心，由于线车放线太快，铁线落到水里，被礁石绊住。急流冲线，拉得木船剧烈地颠簸，我们只好剪断铁线，驶回岸来。
    为了避免引线落水，我们把线车改装在船上，又一次抢渡。船驶到河心，引线突然卡在线车上，线车转不动了。在急流中，木船被引线拉得极度倾斜，巨浪打进船舱，随时都有翻船的危险，我们只好又剪断了引线，木船被冲下老远，才靠上岸来。
    这时候，太阳快要落山了。排长赵和成负了伤，仍然坚持不下火线。他领着大家共同学习了毛主席关于“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利”的教导。同志们说：“毛主席交给我们的任务还没有完成，怎么能回去？”大家纷纷要求继续渡河引线。三班长郭发平把毛主席像挂在船头，怀着对伟大导师毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，激动地对同志们说：“有伟大舵手毛主席给我们领航，天大的困难也能闯过去！”同志们背诵着毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”吸取上两次的经验教训，经过一场英勇搏斗，终于胜利地把引线放过黄河。这时，“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声响成一片，压过了黄河波涛的呼啸声。
    两道飞线很快地悬架在黄河两岸绝峭的高山之间。同志们在总结这次架设黄河飞线的战斗时，满怀革命豪情地歌唱：人说黄河风险大，我们说风险没有啥；革命战士最听毛主席的话，千难万难踩脚下。
