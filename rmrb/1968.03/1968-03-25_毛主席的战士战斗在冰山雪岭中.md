	Chairman Mao's soldiers fight in the icy mountains
	Maintenance Station of a Certain Unit of the Signal Corps

	On the eve of New Year's Day last year, a serious avalanche occurred on the Dasha Mountain. In the valley of the forest farm, the accumulated snow from several mountain peaks collapsed and buried many telegraph poles, with nearly half of the telegraph poles buried in the snow.

	At this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the interruption of communication lines made the signal soldiers, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, anxious and impatient! Several comrades from our maintenance station stood in front of the portrait of the great teacher Chairman Mao and solemnly swore: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! To ensure your leadership of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, even if the heavens collapse and the earth shatters, we must restore the communication lines!" Holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," we sang the song "Down with determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory," and bravely set out, facing the raging winds and snow.

	On the eastern line, comrades Sun Dongsheng and Zhou Yunzhu climbed the ice-covered Dasha Mountain at a temperature of minus forty degrees. The snow slope was slippery, and sometimes a misstep would cause a person and their tools to roll into the deep snow; the telegraph poles were frozen with a layer of ice and snow, making them as slippery as ice sticks. Climbing a seven-meter-high telegraph pole would make one sweat profusely; in the high-altitude wind and snow, connecting wires sometimes would freeze and peel off a layer of skin from one's hands. However, the brave signal soldiers, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings about "The Chinese people are not afraid of death, so why fear difficulties?" with an unyielding revolutionary spirit and a heroic spirit that overcomes all obstacles, fought continuously for three days and nights, finally climbed the ice-covered Dasha Mountain, and restored the communication lines.

	On the western line, comrades Zhang Shirong and Mao Zhongyou were responsible for repairing the communication lines in the valley. They crawled and rolled in snow up to their waists. Every step forward was a struggle. By noon, avalanches occurred continuously, and there was always the danger of being buried in the snow. At that time, they thought of ensuring that Chairman Mao's commands would be communicated as soon as possible. Chairman Mao's teachings about "Dying for the people is a worthy death" made them completely disregard their personal safety. They crawled and rolled in the wind and snow, advancing inch by inch.

	The next day, due to fatigue and cold, Mao Zhongyou caught a severe cold, with dizziness and weak legs, making it difficult to walk. Zhang Shirong then helped him study Chairman Mao's quotations: "Develop a spirit of daring to fight, daring to sacrifice, daring to endure hardships, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." Chairman Mao's teachings inspired them. They supported each other and struggled forward. Sweat soaked their clothes, and if they stopped for a moment, they would freeze. They did not stop and advanced. When hungry, they chewed on frozen bread; when thirsty, they swallowed snow. After three days and nights of continuous struggle, they repaired 22 broken lines and finally reached the boundary pole of the maintenance line.

	The communication lines maintained by our station were repaired, but the telephone of the neighboring station to the west was still not working. Due to long-term work in the snow, everyone's eyes were sore from the snow glare, and with hunger and cold, everyone was very tired. At this time, we thought of Chairman Mao's teachings about "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. Although the maintenance section has boundaries, the responsibility to ensure that Chairman Mao's commands are communicated smoothly is shared. The entire line has not been repaired, so how can we retreat in the face of hardship and fatigue! Thinking of these things, the comrades took firm steps again, crossed the boundary, and fought for another day, helping the neighboring station repair the communication lines, restoring normal communication on the entire trunk line.

	"The sun on the ice-covered Dasha Mountain is exceptionally red, the silver wire on the ice-covered Dasha Mountain reaches Beijing. The soldiers on the ice-covered Dasha Mountain are nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, and the soldiers on the ice-covered Dasha Mountain are forever loyal to the great leader Mao Zedong!" Our victory song echoed through the vast icy mountains and snow-capped peaks, and our hearts, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, were tightly bound together.

    毛主席的战士战斗在冰山雪岭中
    通信兵某部维护站
    去年元旦前夕，大坂山上发生严重雪崩。在林场峡谷中，几个山头的积雪铺天盖地塌压下来，不少电线杆被拦腰砸断，近半数电线杆被埋入积雪。
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，发生通信线路中断，无限忠于毛主席的通信战士怎能不心急如火！我们维护站的几个同志站在伟大导师毛主席像前庄严宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！为了保证您老人家对无产阶级文化大革命的指挥，就是天崩地裂，也一定要把线路修通！”我们手举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录歌，迎着狂风大雪，雄赳赳气昂昂地分头出发了。
    东线的孙冬生、周云柱同志，在零下四十度低温的情况下，攀登海拔四千米的冰大坂。雪滑坡陡，有时一脚没踩稳，就连人带工具一齐滚入没顶的积雪中；电线杆冻上一层冰雪，滑得象根冰棍，爬上一棵七米高的电线杆，就得出一身大汗；在风雪呼啸的高空中接线，有时冰冻的电线就会沾掉手上一层皮。但是，勇敢的通信兵，牢记毛主席关于“中国人死都不怕，还怕困难么”的教导，以一往无前的革命精神，压倒一切的英雄气概，持续战斗了三天三夜，终于爬上了冰大坂，修复了大坂的线路。
    西线的张世荣、毛中友同志负责抢修峡谷的线路。他们一直在齐腰深的雪里爬滚，每前进一步，就是一场搏斗。一到中午，雪崩连续不断，随时都有被埋入雪中的危险。当时，他们想到的是保证毛主席的指挥尽快畅通。毛主席关于“为人民而死，就是死得其所”的教导，使他们把个人的安危完全置之度外。他们在风雪中爬着，滚着，一寸一寸地前进。
    第二天，由于疲劳和寒冷，毛中友患了重感冒，头昏腿软，行走很困难。张世荣就和他一起学习毛主席语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”毛主席的教导鼓舞着他们。他们互相搀扶着，艰难地向前爬滚。汗水湿透了衣服，稍一停息，就会冻成冰，他们就不停息地前进。饿了，就啃一口冻饼，渴了，就吞一把积雪。经过三天三夜的连续奋战，抢修了二十二处断线，终于到达了维护线路的分界杆。
    本站维护的线路抢修通了，西面友邻站的电话还是要不通。由于长时间在雪地工作，同志们的眼睛被雪光刺得发疼，加上饥饿和寒冷，大家都很疲劳。这时，我们又想起了毛主席关于“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，维护的线段虽然有界限，但是保证毛主席指挥通畅的责任却是共同的。整个线路还没修通，我们怎么能够在艰苦和疲劳面前退却呢！想到这些，同志们又迈开坚定的步伐，跨过界杆，又奋战了一天多，帮助友邻站把线路抢修通，使整个干线恢复了正常通信联络。
    “冰大坂的太阳分外红，冰大坂的银线通北京。冰大坂的战士全靠毛泽东思想来哺育，冰大坂的战士永远忠于伟大统帅毛泽东！”我们胜利的歌声震荡着茫茫的冰山雪岭，颗颗无限忠于毛主席的红心紧紧地靠在一起。
