The red sun warms the high-cold "forbidden zone"

Representative of the Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works at the Conference of the Iron Road Army, Political Instructor of the 9th Company of a Certain Unit, Liu Yanglian

The sun shines, the ice melts, and the high-cold "forbidden zone" changes its appearance.

In the vast forest and the snowy plains, under the most extreme cold conditions reaching minus fifty-seven degrees, we, together with our brother units, with unyielding loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, broke through the high-cold "forbidden zone." In the primeval forest, we laid down one steel road after another, and at the same time, forged a batch of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

To stand firm, thoughts must stand firm first

The primeval forest we are to develop is a "green treasure trove." The climate here is extremely cold, with an ice period of eight months each year. Developing this "treasure trove" is of great significance to the socialist construction of our country. The higher-ups ordered us to build the railway into the area, requiring us: "You must stand firm! You must achieve complete victory!"

Receiving this glorious mission, all the soldiers in the company were very excited and unanimously expressed: We are soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and we must turn such and such "forbidden zones" into thoroughfares, making the dormant treasures serve socialist construction. At the same time, according to Chairman Mao's teaching, "In strategy, we must despise all enemies, but in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously," we also fully estimated the difficulties. The Party branch organized all the soldiers in the company to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, inspiring everyone to discuss: What should we rely on to break through the high-cold "forbidden zone"? What should we rely on to stand firm? All the soldiers in the company realized: To break through the high-cold "forbidden zone," the most fundamental thing is not superior material equipment, but the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and the prominence of proletarian politics. To stand firm, thoughts must stand firm first. The soldiers said well: With the boundless spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we can "be loyal to Chairman Mao, have a red heart and hard bones, and charge through ice rivers and snow mountains!" Even if it's minus fifty degrees, we can still go in and stand firm.

This discussion was a vivid class on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and also a profound battle mobilization. Originally, according to the "old rules," entering the primeval forest was in June and exiting in October, never in winter. However, the soldiers heard that they had to wait for a winter, and they all got anxious, saying: The Vietnamese artillery is firing so intensely, and the flames of world revolution are burning so fiercely. Can we just sit still? No way. Let the severe cold test whether our thoughts are hard enough! We broke the "summer in, winter out" rule and, together with our brother units, marched into the high-cold "forbidden zone" in the depths of winter! The soldiers held high the portrait of Chairman Mao, shouting "Determine to struggle, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and set off, carrying their backpacks and tents, crossing ice mountains and forests, straight into the heart of the primeval forest.

Upon arriving at the destination, the sky above was blue, and the ground below was white with snow. Not only were there no houses, but even finding a place to set up a stove was difficult. That place was also a shady ditch, with extremely low temperatures. It was truly "breathing turns to frost, and spitting turns to nails." Tofu was frozen so hard that it had to be cut with a saw, and cabbage had to be chopped with an axe. However, the comrades said happily: This is good, we can display the style of the Iron Road Army and wield the big knife! They hung their tents on four trees, and the footprints they walked were the paths. At night, when they were frozen and couldn't sleep, the platoon leader Zhang Zuwen crawled out of the tent, picked up some dry firewood, lit a bonfire, and led the comrades to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," hold a "sharing session," face Beijing, and sing "The East Is Red"...

To commemorate the great victory of standing firm in the forest area, the comrades named the shady ditch where we lived "Sunny Ditch." Everyone said: "Loyal to Chairman Mao, forever with the sun, with the red sun shining, we can stand firm in the high-cold 'forbidden zone'!"

A red sun in the heart, warm in the ice pit

The company advanced into the forest and snowfield, standing firm in the high-cold "forbidden zone." This was just the beginning of the battle. Immediately after, we started building iron road bridges on the ice river.

Building bridges and roads in winter, this was the first time in the high-cold "forbidden zone." The river was frozen solid, and the ground was frozen like an iron plate. Sometimes, an eighteen-pound iron hammer would break a few iron drills before it could dig a pit the size of a steamed bun. Facing this situation, some comrades were worried about completing the task. A few even said: "Being able to stand firm at minus fifty degrees is already a miracle. Construction, let's wait until summer."

In the face of severe cold, should we adopt a passive defense and hide in the "firewood pile" to "hibernate"? Or should we launch an active offensive and make a big splash in the silver world to seize complete victory? We brought this question to study Chairman Mao's works and the report of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee: "We must have the great ambition and determination of the proletariat, dare to tread the paths that no one has trodden before, and dare to scale the peaks that no one has scaled before." Through study, everyone realized: Whether or not to carry out winter construction is not just a matter of construction time, but a fundamental issue of whether we have the great ambition and determination of the proletariat and whether we are determined to carry the revolution through to the end under the leadership of Chairman Mao. With heightened awareness, the soldiers expressed their determination: We came to the forest and snowfield not to "hibernate," but to "brave the winter." For socialism, for the world revolution, we dare to tread the paths that no one has trodden before, and we must build bridges at minus fifty degrees, making the "green treasure trove" serve socialist construction as soon as possible. All the soldiers in the company followed Chairman Mao's teachings, displaying a fearless spirit, and resolutely declared war on the severe cold and marched towards the ice river. The soldiers said proudly: "The ground is frozen three meters deep, but our hearts are hot with ten thousand degrees of passion! Chairman Mao gives us boundless warmth and strength!" The comrades, with the red book in their arms, went down to the river to shovel snow and chop ice, driving away the severe cold with selfless labor. When encountering difficulties, they repeatedly recited: "Determine to struggle, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." New soldier Kong Fanbao, when he first started chopping ice, swung an eight-pound hammer, shaking his arms and making his palms blister. He repeatedly studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," facing difficulties and tempering himself, gradually increasing to ten pounds, twelve pounds, often working from morning to night without letting comrades replace him. When comrades asked him where he got this spirit from, he said: "Chairman Mao draws the blueprint for communism with his pen, and we follow Chairman Mao to build bridges and roads for the world revolution, holding the red book and reading it every day, swearing to change the mountains and rivers of our motherland."

Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest and the wisest. They not only overcame the severe cold with astonishing willpower but also found ways to utilize the severe cold for construction. From practice, they summarized a set of good methods of "freezing to freeze." When building bridge piers, the river surface in winter froze several meters thick, making it difficult to dig the foundation pit. We utilized the condition that the ice layer on the river was very thick and adopted the "freezing method," peeling off the ice layer by layer. After peeling off one layer, another layer froze, all the way to the river bottom. Without a water pump or piling, we completed the bridge pier foundation.

Under the threat of severe cold, we all hoped the weather would warm up a bit! However, for the sake of the socialist construction of our motherland and the early completion of the construction task, the comrades hoped the weather would get colder. Sometimes, to make the temperature colder and freeze faster, we used tents to block the sun over the foundation pit and poured cold water into the pit to make it freeze faster. Of course, this excavation method made the foundation pit all ice around, and jumping into the pit was like jumping into an ice pit. However, all the soldiers in the company rushed to jump into the ice pit. The comrades said: "With a red sun in the heart, warm in the ice pit, fearless of minus fifty degrees, we will definitely change the mountains and rivers."

One shovel, one pickaxe to build the railway, thousands of hammers and forges a red heart

Last year was the year we achieved the greatest victory in building roads in the high-cold "forbidden zone." In January, we entered a new construction site. At that time, the "January Revolution" storm was sweeping the country, and the comrades, with the firm will to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death, supported the broad masses of the left with actual actions. In less than seven months, we built two large bridges.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution further changed the spiritual face of all the comrades in the company. Building roads in the high-cold "forbidden zone" was extremely tense and arduous, but the soldiers, with the boundless Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, established the great ambition of "fearing neither hardship nor death" for the socialist construction of our motherland, not only did not feel bitter but felt it was the greatest honor and happiness. We turned the construction site into a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating private interests and revisionism, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois philosophy of life peddled by China's Khrushchev, guiding everyone to study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles," criticize and repudiate private interests, and thoroughly reform their worldview. The soldiers said well: One shovel, one pickaxe to build the railway, touching the soul at every moment, "completely" and "thoroughly" doing revolution, forging a red heart with thousands of hammers and forges. New soldier Lu Jindong from Shanghai's Nanjing Road, when he first came to the forest and snowfield, saw the heavy work in the great wind and snow he had never seen before, and his heart was timid. At first, he had to wear four masks to stand guard. Later, he studied Chairman Mao's teachings with questions in mind: "The establishment of the socialist system has opened up a road for us to reach the ideal realm, but the realization of the ideal realm still depends on our hard work." Chairman Mao's teachings made him understand: Working for socialism and the world revolution, the heavier the burden, the more glorious. From then on, he worked with his comrades to shovel snow and chop ice, quickly tempering himself into a strong soldier who could endure hardship and heavy labor.

In the primeval forest, life was relatively hard, and clothes wore out quickly. Soldier Li Xueshun's every piece of clothing was mended again and again, and he was reluctant to take it off. Did soldier Li Xueshun have no clothes! No. He once turned in four sets of military uniforms. We advised him to keep some for himself and not to turn in so many, but he said: "I am not turning in one or two pieces of clothing, I am turning in the results of studying Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches us to 'completely selfless and dedicated to others,' for the liberation and happiness of the laboring people all over the world, to work hard and endure hardship, the heart is sweet!" In terms of climate, the high-cold "forbidden zone" is very cold; in terms of reforming thoughts, here is a high-temperature furnace that can burn away many private thoughts and forge a red heart loyal to Chairman Mao.

"Chairman Mao draws the blueprint for communism with his pen, and we follow Chairman Mao to build bridges and roads for the world revolution, holding the red book and reading it every day, swearing to change the mountains and rivers of our motherland."

The heroic People's Liberation Army Iron Road Army, with unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, has been fighting for many years in all directions of our motherland. They braved wind and snow, fought severe cold, endured scorching heat, battled fierce waves, endured hardship and heavy labor, and made great contributions to the socialist economic construction and national defense construction of our motherland.

What did they rely on to fight against nature and lay down one steel road after another? It was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, they could "have a red heart and hard bones, and charge through ice rivers and snow mountains!" Hard places are the best battlefields for criticizing and repudiating private interests and revisionism. The soldiers of the Iron Road Army not only built one steel transportation line after another but, more importantly, built a red line in their minds to be dedicated to the revolution, prevent and oppose revisionism.

　　红太阳照暖了高寒“禁区”
　　铁道兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表  某部九连政治指导员  刘养连
    太阳照，冰河消，高寒“禁区”换新貌。
    在茫茫林海，皑皑雪原，在最低达到零下五十七度的高寒条件下，我们和兄弟部队一起，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，突破高寒“禁区”，在原始森林里铺起了一条条钢铁大道，同时也炼出了一批批无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    人要站住脚，思想先要站住脚
    我们要开发的这片原始森林，是一个“绿色的宝库”。这里气候奇寒，每年冰冻期达八个月。开发这个“宝库”，对我国的社会主义建设有着重大的意义。上级命令我们把铁路修进去，要求我们：“一定要站住脚！一定要取得全胜！”
    接受了这一光荣任务，全连同志非常兴奋，一致表示：我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，就是要把这样那样的“禁区”变成通途，使沉睡的宝藏为社会主义建设服务。同时，根据毛主席“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的教导，我们也充分估计到了困难。党支部组织全连同志活学活用毛主席著作和林副主席指示，启发大家讨论：究竟靠什么突破高寒“禁区”，靠什么站住脚？全连同志认识到：要突破高寒“禁区”，主要的不是靠优越的物资设备，最根本的是靠光焰无际的毛泽东思想，靠突出无产阶级政治。人要站住脚，思想先要站住脚。战士们说得好：有毛泽东思想这个威力无穷的精神原子弹武装了头脑，就能“忠于毛主席，心红骨头硬，冰川雪岭任我冲！”别说零下五十几度，就是再冷一些，也能进得去，站住脚。
    这次讨论，是一堂生动的活学活用毛泽东思想的政治课，也是一次深入的战斗动员。本来，照“老规矩”，进原始森林都是六月进，十月出，从来没有冬天进去的。可是战士们听说要等一冬，都急了，说：越南炮火打得这么紧，世界革命烈火烧得这么旺，我们能呆着？不行。就让严寒考考我们的思想过不过得硬！我们打破了“夏进冬出”的“规矩”，和兄弟部队一起，就在隆冬腊月向高寒“禁区”大进军！战士们高举毛主席像，高喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”背起背包，抬着帐篷，翻过冰山，穿过林海，一直闯进原始森林中央。
    到了目的地，头上蓝天一块，地下白雪一片，不但没房子，找个安锅灶的地方都困难。那儿又是个背阴沟，气温特低，真是“呵气成霜，吐痰成钉”，豆腐冻得用锯子锯，白菜要用斧头劈。同志们却乐呵呵地说：这好嘛，可以发扬铁道兵的作风，大刀阔斧！他们把帐篷往四棵树上一挂就是家，走过的脚印就是路。夜晚冻得睡不着觉，班长张祖文就钻出帐篷，捡来一些干柴，烧起一堆篝火，领着同志们学习《为人民服务》，开“讲用会”，面向北京，高唱《东方红》……为了纪念在林区站住了脚这个伟大胜利，同志们把我们住的背阴沟起名为“太阳沟”。大家说：“忠于毛主席，就永远和太阳在一起，有红太阳照耀着，就能在高寒‘禁区’站住脚！”
    心中有个红太阳　身在冰窟暖洋洋
    连队开进林海雪原，在高寒“禁区”胜利地站住了脚，这只是战斗的开始。紧接着，我们又动手在冰河上修建铁路桥梁。
    冬季修桥筑路，这在高寒“禁区”还是破天荒第一次。河流冻得死死的，大地冻成铁板一块，十八磅重的铁锤打下去，有时钢钎打断了几根，才啃出个馒头大的坑坑。面对这种情况，有的同志担心完不成任务。个别的同志还说：“能在零下五十多度站住脚，这已经是个奇迹，施工，到夏季再说。”
    在严寒面前，是消极防御，钻到“柴禾堆”里“猫冬”呢？还是积极进攻，在白银世界里大干一场，去夺取全胜？我们又带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作和八届十一中全会公报：“我们一定要有无产阶级的雄心壮志，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。”通过学习，大家认识到：敢不敢进行冬季施工，不光是个施工时间问题，实质上是有没有无产阶级的雄心壮志，是不是紧跟毛主席把革命进行到底的大问题。认识提高了，战士们纷纷表示：我们来到林海雪原，不是来“猫冬”的，是来“闯冬”的。为了社会主义，为了世界革命，我们敢于走前人没有走过的路，就是要在零下五十几度修起大桥来，让“绿色的宝库”尽快地为社会主义建设服务。全连同志遵循毛主席的教导，发扬一往无前的精神，坚决向严寒宣战，向冰河进军。战士们豪迈地说：“地冻三米，心热万丈，毛主席他老人家给我们无比的温暖和力量！”同志们怀揣红色宝书，下河铲雪刨冰，以忘我的劳动驱散严寒。遇到困难，就一次又一次地背诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”新战士孔繁保，开始刨冰时，抡起八磅大锤，震得两臂酸疼，虎口开裂。他反复学习《愚公移山》，迎着困难进行锻炼，逐渐增加到十磅、十二磅，常常从早打到晚，不让同志替换他。同志们问他这股劲从那里来？他说：“毛主席挥笔为共产主义绘蓝图，我们紧跟毛主席为世界革命架桥铺路，手捧红色宝书天天读，誓叫祖国江山换新图。”
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，最勇敢，最聪明。他们不仅以惊人的毅力战胜严寒，还想方设法利用严寒为施工服务，从实践中研究总结出一套“以冻制冻”的好办法。在修建桥墩时，冬季河面冻起几米厚的冰，开挖基坑很困难，我们就利用冰河冻层很厚这个条件，采用“冻结法”，把冰河一层一层往下揭。揭开一层就冻上一层，一直揭到河底。不用抽水机，也不用打桩，就把桥墩基础打好了。
    在严寒威胁下，我们是多么希望天气变暖一些啊！但是，为了祖国社会主义建设事业，为了施工任务早日完成，同志们却巴不得天气变冷一些。有时为了使气温更冷些，冻得更快些，我们还用帐篷支在基坑上挡着阳光，把冷水泼进基坑，让它快些结冻。当然，这种开挖法，基坑周围全是冰，跳进基坑，就象跳进了冰窟里。可是全连指战员都抢着往冰窟里跳。同志们说：“心中有个红太阳，身在冰窟暖洋洋，零下五十度何足惧，定让山河换新装。”
    一锹一镐修铁路　千锤百炼铸红心
    去年一年，是我们在高寒“禁区”修路取得胜利最大的一年。一月间，我们进入一个新工地。当时，“一月革命”风暴正席卷全国，同志们怀着誓死捍卫毛主席，誓死捍卫毛泽东思想，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的坚定意志，以实际行动支持左派广大群众，不到七个月，一举修起两座大桥。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，进一步改变了全连同志的精神面貌。在高寒“禁区”修路，劳动是十分紧张、艰苦的，但是，战士们有光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装了头脑，树立了为祖国社会主义建设一不怕苦、二不怕死的雄心，不但不觉得苦，反而觉得是最大的光荣，最大的幸福。我们把劳动现场办成斗私批修的战场，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖的资产阶级人生哲学，引导大家活学活用“老三篇”，破私立公，认真改造世界观。战士们说得好：一锹一镐修铁路，时时刻刻触灵魂，“完全”“彻底”干革命，千锤百炼铸红心。来自上海南京路的新战士路金栋，刚到林海雪原，看到在过去没有见过的大风雪里进行紧张的劳动，心里很胆怯。开始，他站哨还要戴上四个口罩。后来，他带着问题学习了毛主席的教导：“社会主义制度的建立给我们开辟了一条到达理想境界的道路，而理想境界的实现还要靠我们的辛勤劳动。”毛主席的教导使他懂得了：为社会主义、为世界革命而劳动，担子越重越光荣。从此，他和同志们一起刨冰铲雪，很快地锻炼成能吃大苦、耐大劳的坚强战士。
    在原始森林里，生活是比较艰苦的，衣服磨损很快。战士李学顺的每一件衣服都是补了又补，还舍不得脱下。是李学顺同志没有衣服了吗！不。他一次就上交了四套军服。我们劝他留下自己穿，不要上交这么多，他说：“我交的不是一件两件衣服，我交的是学习毛主席著作的成果。毛主席教导我们要‘毫不利己专门利人’，为了全世界劳动人民的解放和幸福，艰苦奋斗，吃点苦，心里甜！”从气候讲，高寒“禁区”温度很低；从改造思想说，这里却是高温熔炉，能够烧掉人们许多私心杂念，炼出一颗忠于毛主席的红心。
    “毛主席挥笔为共产主义绘蓝图，我们紧跟毛主席为世界革命架桥铺路，手捧红色宝书天天读，誓叫祖国江山换新图。”
    英雄的人民解放军铁道兵部队，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，长年累月战斗在祖国的四面八方。他们顶风雪、斗严寒、冒酷暑、战恶浪、吃大苦、耐大劳，为祖国社会主义经济建设和国防建设，作出了巨大贡献。
    他们靠什么战天斗地，铺起一条条钢铁大道？就是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。用毛泽东思想武装了人的头脑，就能“心红骨头硬，冰川雪岭任我冲！”艰苦的地方，是斗私批修的最好战场。铁道兵战士不仅修起了条条钢铁运输线，更重要的是在自己思想上筑起了一条一心为革命，防修、反修的红线。
    这里发表的几篇文章，是出席铁道兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会部分代表学习毛主席著作的心得体会。　——编者（附图片）
