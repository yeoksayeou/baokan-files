	Soldiers are like young seedlings,
	Watered by the spring rain of Mao Zedong Thought,
	Roots deep, leaves lush, evergreen,
	Unshaken by storms and tempests.

	Shi Fudian, the driver of Tank Company One of a certain armored unit, has grown vigorously under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. He has deeply rooted the five characters "Serve the People" in his mind and truly implemented them in his actions. For the people's interests, in critical moments of life and death, he has the greatest courage; in the face of difficulties, he has unyielding willpower; in class struggle, he has a firm stance. He writes, with his actions, an endless chapter of loyalty to Chairman Mao and complete and thorough service to the people.

	Serve the People, Fear Not Even Death

	Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts and the bravest spirits. Shi Fudian began with studying and applying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," understanding the meaning of serving the people, and establishing the revolutionary spirit of bravery and fearlessness to protect the people's interests.

	During a nighttime tank exercise, Shi Fudian was in charge of directing traffic at a road and railway intersection. After guiding all the tanks through the intersection, he noticed a piece of railway sleeper stuck between the track and the guard rail. If not removed, it would cause a derailment when the train passed, resulting in a serious accident. At that moment, there were no tools at hand, and Shi Fudian and the track workers exerted all their strength but could not move it. Just as the track workers went to fetch tools, the sound of an approaching train was heard in the distance. A freight train was rushing towards them. Seeing that the people's lives and property were in danger, Shi Fudian's heart burned with urgency, and his blood boiled. He used his flashlight to signal the train desperately, shouting, but the train continued to roar forward.

	What to do? What to do? At this moment, Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people echoed in his ears: "Our army is completely for the people, and it works thoroughly for the people's interests." Chairman Mao's instructions gave Shi Fudian the greatest courage. He had only one thought: rush forward, even if it means death, stop the train! He disregarded his own safety, leaped into the track, and ran towards the train, waving his arms and shouting, "Stop the train! Stop the train!" The train driver suddenly saw someone in the track and blew the horn repeatedly. Shi Fudian, to force the train to stop, stood firmly in the track, facing the oncoming train, unmoving. At this moment, the driver felt the situation was urgent and immediately applied the emergency brake. The train shook violently and stopped just three or four sleepers away from Shi Fudian.

	Shi Fudian used his body as a stop signal, preventing a major derailment accident, and safeguarding the people's lives and property. He composed a victory song of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The train workers tightly grasped Shi Fudian's hand, excitedly saying, "You saved the train, you saved us! You are a good soldier nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought!" Passersby, night-shift workers, and nearby villagers all gathered around, praising Shi Fudian as a "living Ou Yanghai!" Shi Fudian humbly said, "Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people, and I should do this!" How simple and yet how noble!

	Thousands of Changes, the Red Heart for Serving the People Never Changes

	Shi Fudian, with unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, starts from establishing the fundamental viewpoint of serving the people, striving to master Mao Zedong Thought, learning a bit and applying it, practicing Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people. Work is hard, but the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people does not waver; the environment changes, but the standard of completely and thoroughly serving the people does not change.

	Once, during tank driving training, Shi Fudian served as an assistant instructor. After demonstrating uphill and downhill driving to the trainees, he jumped down from the tank and landed on a pothole, feeling a sharp pain in his left foot. His foot swelled up, and walking became painful. Continuing the training would be very difficult. Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people gave him strength. He decided that no matter how great the difficulty, he must put revolutionary work first, persist, and complete the tasks assigned by the Party. To avoid the leaders and comrades knowing, he secretly used hot water to soak his foot at night and continued the intense training the next day. He dragged his painful foot, running back and forth on the uneven driving field. Every step on the ground was a sharp pain, so he walked on his heels. His foot swelled day by day, and his liberation shoes could no longer be worn. He changed into large-sized cotton tank boots, supporting his left foot, and fought tenaciously against the pain, persisting in the training. The company commander noticed that he had difficulty getting on the tank and kindly asked if his foot was injured? Shi Fudian, enduring the pain, replied, "No problem." In front of the company commander, he led the trainees to run and get on the tank. Every step was heart-wrenching, beads of sweat formed on his forehead. When climbing onto the tank, his left foot was so painful that he could not step on it, so he stood on one foot on the tank, guiding the trainees in their operations. Only when his foot swelled so much that he could no longer wear his tank boots was he finally discovered by the leaders and immediately sent to the outpatient department for examination. After the doctor's diagnosis, it was found that his left foot was fractured, and he needed to be hospitalized for treatment.

	In the hospital, Shi Fudian still remembered to serve the people. He said: My foot is injured, but my mouth can still propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and my hands can still work for the people. The ward is my new post for serving the people. He organized the patients to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, discussing their thoughts. Under Shi Fudian's influence, the entire surgical ward was filled with a thick political atmosphere. The patients used Mao Zedong Thought to fight against their illnesses, following Chairman Mao's teachings to "care for each other, love and help each other." The ward became a large classroom for studying Mao Zedong Thought. Shi Fudian also formed a "Red Pair" with a worker in the next bed, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works together, carrying out mutual assistance in thoughts. This worker comrade had a heavier injury and was worried about becoming disabled and unable to return to work at his unit. Shi Fudian and he studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" together, recalling bitterness and sweetness. Chairman Mao's teachings broadened this worker comrade's mind. He told Shi Fudian, "Serving the people has no time or place. Even if disabled, as long as there is a breath, one should serve the people." Several students were also hospitalized, and Shi Fudian became their tutor, helping them study Chairman Mao's quotations, review their lessons, and care for their lives.

	In the four years since his enlistment, Shi Fudian has experienced various situations and encountered various difficulties. Every time he received a task and encountered difficulties, he first studied "Serve the People," using Mao Zedong Thought to guide his actions. Wherever Chairman Mao pointed, he fought there. Once, Shi Fudian led several comrades from his company to transport vehicles. This was his first time executing a task far from the leadership. The journey was long, the time was long, and the burden was heavy. He reported to the Party branch, "We have left the company and the leadership, but we have Mao Zedong Thought commanding our battles. No matter how many difficulties there are, we can overcome them and achieve results to report to Chairman Mao." He and his comrades studied Chairman Mao's teachings over and over again: "Our responsibility is to the people." When picking up the vehicles at the factory, he insisted on checking each vehicle. The factory workers said they had already checked them, and he could just spot-check a few. He said, "It's a small matter for us to be troublesome, but it's a big matter to be responsible to the people." He and his comrades, with a spirit of complete and thorough responsibility, checked every screw, every fuse, and every tool on the vehicles, ensuring they met the requirements before loading and transporting them. During the transport, Shi Fudian sat on the flatbed car. At that time, it was the coldest days of winter, and he and his comrades held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," studying the teachings on serving the people. The cold wind was biting, but their hearts for serving the people were burning. To protect the weapons and equipment entrusted by the people, as soon as the train stopped, he quickly jumped off to carefully check every tank, every tarp rope, and every fixing wood. At night, he stood guard on the car in the bitter cold wind. He always thought about the tasks entrusted by the Party and the people, and on the journey, he did not sleep well for seven days and seven nights, completing the task excellently and receiving praise from the leadership.

	Shi Fudian seriously practiced Chairman Mao's teachings and advanced on the path of completely and thoroughly serving the people. In four years of enlistment, he was evaluated as an excellent soldier every year and had attended the model soldier representative conferences of the division and Beijing Garrison.

	Unlimited Loyalty to Chairman Mao is the Highest Standard of Completely and Thoroughly Serving the People

	The great proletarian cultural revolution is a political class without lessons and an exam without tests.

	Shi Fudian, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, tempered his red heart for loyalty to Chairman Mao even more. He deeply understood that defending Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is to defend the fundamental interests of all the people in China and the world, ensuring that our country will never change color. Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the highest standard for a revolutionary soldier to completely and thoroughly serve the people.

	Last February, Shi Fudian received the battle command of the great leader Chairman Mao, going to a middle school in Beijing to carry out military training, serving as the platoon leader of the March 8th class. He said: Chairman Mao entrusted us with the glorious task of "Three Supports and Two Military Affairs." This is Chairman Mao's greatest trust in our military cadres and soldiers. We resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. This is the concrete manifestation of completely and thoroughly serving the people in this stage. After entering the school, he actively worked with revolutionary teachers and students to thoroughly criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, further arousing hatred towards the handful of capitalist roaders headed by China's Khrushchev, and deepening his unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

	Soon, Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions were issued. Shi Fudian, with unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao, actively and enthusiastically propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions. The revolutionary youngsters actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call, returning to their classes to make revolution, achieving revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes. However, after a few days of unity, due to the influence of anarchist thoughts in society, some students withdrew from the class unity, established their own factions, and continuous "internal wars" occurred. The school's struggle, criticism, and transformation could not be carried out. Facing this complex situation, Shi Fudian was somewhat disheartened. He studied Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions on the great proletarian cultural revolution, reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on completely and thoroughly serving the people, and realized that his thoughts were wrong: Red Guards are revolutionary pioneers, they love Chairman Mao, they withdrew from the class unity, it was his own propaganda of Chairman Mao's latest instructions that was not enough, the work was not done thoroughly. He actively checked with the Red Guard youngsters, using every opportunity to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to them, studying and discussing problems with them, exchanging opinions. A student withdrew from the class unity and had a strong opposition to the military training team. Shi Fudian actively talked with him, visiting his home several times, propagating Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions to his parents, and mobilizing his parents to assist the military training team in helping the student. Through school-internal and school-external work, this student initially recognized his mistakes. However, some problems had not been solved in his thoughts. Shi Fudian continued to help him patiently. During the autumn harvest labor, he lived with this student, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions together. Under Shi Fudian's help, this student deepened his understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, returned to school, and openly criticized his selfishness, fighting against factionalism, and returned to the class unity. The students of the March 8th class, under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, united and joined the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation, and the great proletarian cultural revolution presented a new situation.

	Shi Fudian, in the great waves of class struggle, seriously practiced Chairman Mao's teachings, advancing on the path of completely and thoroughly serving the people, undergoing new tempering and tests, and advancing unceasingly.

　　把“为人民服务”五个大字真正落实在行动上
　　——记装甲兵学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部坦克一连车长石福田
    战士好比小幼苗，
    毛泽东思想春雨浇，
    根深叶茂常年绿，
    狂风暴雨不动摇。
    装甲兵某部坦克一连车长石福田，在毛泽东思想哺育下，茁壮地成长。他把“为人民服务”五个大字深深扎根在头脑里，真正落实在行动上。为了人民利益，在情况危急的生死关头，他有最大的勇敢；在困难面前，他有顽强的毅力；在阶级斗争中，他有坚定的立场。他用自己的行动，书写着无限忠于毛主席，“完全”“彻底”为人民的篇章。
    为人民服务，粉身碎骨何所惧
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士心最红，胆最壮。石福田从活学活用“老三篇”开始，懂得了为人民服务的道理，树立了为保卫人民利益，勇敢不怕死的革命献身精神。
    在一次坦克夜间演习的时候，石福田担任公路和铁路交叉口调度员。当他引导着坦克全部通过路口以后，发现道轨和护轮轨之间卡着一段枕木，不取出来，火车通过的时候，就会造成脱轨翻车的严重事故。当时手头没有工具，石福田和养路工人用尽全身的力气，也搬不出来。就在养路工人回去取工具的时候，远处传来隆隆的响声，一列货车疾驰而来。眼看人民的生命财产就要受到损失，在这紧急关头，石福田心急如火，热血沸腾。他用手电筒朝着火车焦急地晃动，拚命地呼喊，可是火车依旧轰响着向前飞驰。
    怎么办？怎么办？这时，毛主席关于为人民服务的教导在他的耳旁回响：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”毛主席的指示，使石福田有了最大勇敢。他只有一个念头：冲上去，死也要把火车拦住！他不顾自身的安危跃进道心，迎着火车飞跑上去，挥动双手，大声疾呼：停车！停车！火车司机突然发现道心有人，连鸣汽笛。石福田为了迫使火车停下来，面对向他冲来的火车，岿然挺立在道心，一动不动。这时，司机感到情况紧急，立即紧急刹车，火车一阵剧烈的震动，在离石福田仅有三、四根枕木的地方停了下来。
    石福田用自己的身体作为停车信号，避免了一场重大的翻车事故，保住了人民的生命财产，谱写了一曲毛泽东思想的胜利凯歌。
    机车工人紧紧地握住石福田的手激动地说：“你救了火车，救了我们！你是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育起来的好战士！”过路的夜班工人和在附近抗旱的社员都围了上来，不住口地夸赞石福田是“活着的欧阳海”！石福田谦逊地说：“毛主席教导我们要为人民服务，我应该这样做！”
    这是多么朴素的语言！又是多么崇高的思想！
    千变万变，为人民服务的红心永不变
    石福田怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，从树立为人民服务这个根本观点入手，努力掌握毛泽东思想，学一点，用一点，实践着毛主席关于为人民服务的教导。工作艰苦，全心全意为人民服务的思想不动摇；环境变了，“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的标准不变。
    一次，坦克驾驶训练，石福田担任助教。他给学员做完了上下坡驾驶示范，下车的时候，正跳到一块坑洼地上，只觉得左脚一阵剧痛，脚面肿了起来，走起路来疼痛难忍，继续坚持训练有很大困难。毛主席关于为人民服务的教导给了他力量。他决心不管困难多大，也要把革命工作放在第一位，坚持下去，完成党交给的任务。为了不让领导和同志们知道，晚上回来，偷偷地用热水烫一烫，第二天继续投入紧张的训练。他拖着疼痛的脚，在起伏不平的驾驶场跑来跑去。脚掌着地就是一阵剧痛，他就用脚后跟走。脚面一天天肿大起来，解放鞋穿不上了，他换上大号的棉坦克靴，支撑着左脚，顽强地和疼痛作斗争，坚持训练。连长发现他上车很费力，亲切地问他是不是脚有毛病？石福田忍着疼痛回答：“没有问题。”在连长面前，他带领学员跑步上车。每跑一步，都疼得揪心，额头冒出豆粒大的汗珠，爬上坦克的时候，左脚痛得不敢着地，他就一只脚站在车上，指导学员操作。直到脚肿得连坦克靴也穿不上的时候，终于被领导发现，立即送他到门诊部检查。经过医生诊断，是左脚脚面骨折，要住院治疗。
    在医院里，石福田仍旧念念不忘为人民服务。他说：我的脚有了毛病，我的嘴还能宣传毛泽东思想，我的手还能为人民工作，病房就是我为人民服务的新岗位。他组织病人活学活用毛主席著作，针对病人的活思想，展开讨论。在石福田带动下，整个外科病房充满了浓厚的政治空气。病员们用毛泽东思想去和疾病作斗争，按照毛主席教导，“互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”。病房成了学习毛泽东思想的大课堂。石福田还和邻床的一位工人结成了“一对红”，一起活学活用毛主席著作，开展思想互助。这位工人同志伤势比较重，担心自己残废了，不能回本单位工作，思想有些负担。石福田和他一起学习“老三篇”，一起忆苦思甜。毛主席的教导使这位工人同志的心胸开阔起来。他对石福田说：“为人民服务没有时间地点之分，即使残废了，只要还有一口气，就要为人民服务。”几个小学生住了院，石福田就当他们的辅导员，帮助他们学习毛主席语录，温习功课，关心他们的生活。
    石福田入伍四年来，经历过各种情况，碰到过各种困难，每次接受任务，遇到困难，他都首先学习《为人民服务》，用毛泽东思想统帅自己的行动，毛主席指到哪里，他就在哪里战斗。一次，石福田带领连里几个同志外出运送车辆，这是他第一次远离领导执行任务。路途远，时间长，担子重。他向党支部表示：“我们离开了连队，离开了领导，但是有毛泽东思想指挥我们战斗，不管有多少困难，我们都能克服，做出成绩，向毛主席汇报。”他和同志们一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的教导：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”到工厂接车时，他要求逐车检查，工厂的同志说：已经检查过了，你们抽查几辆就行了，不要再麻烦了。他说：“自己麻烦事小，对人民负责事大。”他和同志们以“完全”“彻底”的负责精神，对车辆上的一个螺钉，一根保险丝，一件工具都要仔细清点，直到完全合乎要求，才装车起运。在运车途中，石福田坐在平板车上，当时正是数九寒天，他和同志们手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，学习为人民服务的教导。寒风刺骨，但是他们为人民服务的心火热。为了保卫好人民交给的武器装备，火车一到站，他就飞快地跳下车认真检查，每一辆坦克，每一根篷布绳，每一根固定木都不放过。夜晚，他冒着凛冽的寒风在车上警戒。他时刻想着党和人民交给的任务，旅途上七天七夜没有睡好觉，出色地完成了任务，受到了领导机关的表扬。
    石福田认真地实践着毛主席的教导，在“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的道路上，不断前进。入伍四年，年年被评为五好战士，先后出席过师、北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。
　　无限忠于毛主席，是“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的最高标准
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命是不上课的政治课，不经考试的考试。
    石福田在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，忠于毛主席的红心锤炼得更红。他深刻地认识到：保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的革命路线，就是保卫全中国和全世界人民的根本利益，保证我们国家永远不变颜色。无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，这是一个革命战士“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的最高标准。
    去年二月，石福田接受了伟大统帅毛主席的战斗命令，到北京一所中学执行军训任务，担任三八班排长。他说：毛主席把“三支”“两军”的光荣任务交给我们，这是毛主席对我军指战员最大的信任。我们坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，落实毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，这是“完全”“彻底”为人民服务在现阶段的具体体现。进校后，他积极和革命师生一起，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，更加激起了对中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的仇恨，更加深了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。
    不久，毛主席的“三·七”指示发出了。石福田怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，积极热情宣传贯彻毛主席的“三·七”指示。革命小将积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，回到班级复课闹革命，实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合。可是联合了没几天，由于社会上无政府主义思潮的影响，一些同学退出了班级大联合，另立山头，“内战”连续不断，学校的斗批改无法进行。面对这种复杂的情况，石福田有些灰心。他学习了毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，重温了毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，认识到自己的想法错了：红卫兵是革命闯将，他们是热爱毛主席的，他们退出班级大联合，是自己对毛主席的最新指示宣传不够，工作没有做到家。他主动向红卫兵小将作了检查，利用一切机会向他们宣传毛主席的最新指示，和他们共同学习，讨论问题，交换意见。有一个同学退出了班级大联合，和军训团对立情绪比较大。石福田主动和他谈心，几次到这个学生家里去访问，向家长宣传毛主席的“三·七”指示，动员家长协助军训团对学生进行帮助。经过校内校外工作，这个同学初步认识了自己的错误。但是，有些问题还没有从思想上解决。石福田继续对他进行耐心帮助。在秋收劳动中，他和这个同学住在一起，共同学习毛主席最新指示。在石福田的帮助下，这个同学加深了对毛主席最新指示的理解，回到学校以后，大亮私心，狠斗派性，回到了班级大联合。三八班的同学在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，联合起来，投入了学校的斗批改，无产阶级文化大革命出现了新局面。
    石福田在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，认真实践着毛主席的教导，在“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的道路上，经受新的锻炼和考验，不断前进。
