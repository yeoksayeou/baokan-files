Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

March 29, 1968

On March 21 and 22, U.S. aggressor aircraft carried out savage bombing raids on the liberated areas of Laos, particularly the city of Khang Khay, causing heavy losses of life and property among the local people. In these raids, U.S. aggressor aircraft once again bombed the residence of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission in Laos, causing serious damage to the mission's buildings. The Chinese government and people strongly condemn and protest in the strongest terms the criminal acts of U.S. imperialism.

The savage bombing of Khang Khay by U.S. aggressor aircraft is by no means an isolated incident.

The recent spring offensive by the people and soldiers of South Vietnam has put the U.S. aggressors in a desperate and chaotic situation, facing unprecedented difficulties and passivity. In a desperate attempt to reverse the situation, U.S. imperialism is frantically expanding its war of aggression in Vietnam, trying to drag the war into Laos. U.S. aggressor aircraft have been intensifying their bombing of the liberated areas of Laos. Under U.S. orders, rightist forces in Laos have been launching repeated military attacks on the liberated areas. U.S. imperialism is also actively plotting to send U.S. and Thai ground troops into Laos, further escalating its armed intervention. The savage bombing of Khang Khay and the Chinese mission's residence by U.S. aggressor aircraft is part of U.S. imperialism's scheme to intensify its war of aggression in Laos.

However, U.S. imperialism's attempt to expand its war of aggression in Laos has met with fierce resistance from the Lao people. Especially since this spring, the heroic Lao people have demonstrated the immense power of people's war, smashing one military offensive after another by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, annihilating large numbers of enemy troops, and achieving brilliant victories. This has brought about a new situation in the Lao people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national liberation. No matter how much the U.S. bombs the liberated areas of Laos, it cannot reverse its inevitable doom of failure.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "The people who have already won revolution should support the struggle of the people who are still striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." The Chinese people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have always regarded the struggle of the Lao people as our own struggle and have regarded supporting the Lao people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national liberation as our unshirkable internationalist duty. The Chinese people will firmly and unyieldingly support the just struggle of the Lao people until final victory.

The Chinese government and people solemnly warn U.S. imperialism: The crimes you have committed against the Chinese people will definitely be settled, and you must bear all the consequences that follow.

Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, March 29

From 3:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on March 21 and from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. on March 22, more than 80 sorties of U.S. aggressor aircraft carried out savage bombing and strafing raids on Khang Khay, the former location of the Lao Patriotic United Front Government, causing heavy losses of life and property among the local people. U.S. aggressor aircraft also bombed the residence of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission in Laos, dropping a large number of bombs and causing serious damage to the mission's buildings.

The savage bombing by U.S. imperialism has aroused the extreme indignation and fighting spirit of the local patriotic military and people. The soldiers of an anti-aircraft artillery unit stationed on a hilltop, undaunted by fatigue and sacrifice, filled with deep hatred for the U.S. air pirates, punished the enemy aircraft with fierce artillery fire, shooting down seven enemy planes on the spot.

The military and people of the Khang Khay region strongly condemn the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism in savagely killing innocent Lao people, and at the same time, enthusiastically celebrate their own victories.

    我外交部强烈抗议美机再次轰炸我驻老挝经济文化代表团驻地
    中国人民全力支持老挝人民斗争直到最后胜利
    严正警告美帝：中国人民一定要清算美帝所犯下的罪行
    新华社二十九日讯中华人民共和国外交部二十九日发表声明，强烈抗议美国强盗飞机又一次轰炸中国驻老挝经济文化代表团驻地的罪行，重申中国人民将坚定不移地全力支援老挝人民的正义斗争，直到最后胜利。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
    一九六八年三月二十九日
    三月二十一日、二十二日，美国强盗飞机对老挝解放区康开市进行了狂轰滥炸，使当地人民的生命财产受到重大损失。在这次空袭中，美国强盗飞机又一次轰炸了中国驻老挝经济文化代表团的驻地，使中国代表团的房屋受到严重破坏。中国政府和中国人民愤怒声讨并且强烈抗议美帝国主义的罪恶行径。
    美国强盗这次对康开进行野蛮轰炸，绝不是偶然的。
    越南南方军民的新春大捷，打得美国侵略者走投无路，狼狈不堪，陷入空前被动和困难的境地。为了挽救败局，美帝国主义正在疯狂扩大侵略越南的战争，力图把这场战争扩大到老挝。美国强盗飞机不断加强对老挝解放区的轰炸。在美国指使下，老挝右派军队接连向解放区发动军事进攻。美帝国主义还积极策划派遣美、泰地面部队进入老挝，进一步对老挝进行武装干涉。美国强盗飞机大肆轰炸康开和中国代表团驻地，就是美帝国主义加紧扩大侵略老挝战争的一个行动。
    但是，美帝国主义扩大侵略老挝的战争，遭到了老挝人民的英勇反击。特别是今年新春以来，英雄的老挝人民发挥了人民战争的无比威力，粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗一个又一个的军事进攻，消灭了敌人大量有生力量，取得了辉煌战果，使老挝人民的抗美救国战争出现了一个新局面。不论美国怎样对老挝解放区加紧轰炸，绝对挽回不了它必然失败的可耻命运。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”中国人民遵循毛主席的教导，一贯把老挝人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争，把支援老挝人民抗美救国战争看作是自己义不容辞的国际主义义务。中国人民将坚定不移地全力支援老挝人民的正义斗争，直到最后胜利。
    中国政府和中国人民严正警告美帝国主义：你们对中国人民所犯下的罪行是一定要清算的，你们必须承担由此而产生的一切后果。
    新华社康开二十九日电　三月二十一日十五时至十七时半、二十二日十五时至十六时半，八十多架次美国强盗飞机对前老挝民族团结政府所在地康开市连续进行野蛮轰炸和扫射，给当地人民的生命、财产造成重大损失。美国强盗飞机还轰炸了中国驻老挝经济文化代表团驻地，投下大批炸弹，使中国代表团的房屋再次遭受严重破坏。
    美帝国主义的狂轰滥炸，激起了当地爱国军民的极大愤慨和英勇的战斗精神。驻守在高地的某部高射炮部队指战员们不怕疲劳，不怕牺牲，怀着对美国空中强盗的刻骨仇恨，以猛烈的炮火严惩美国飞贼，当场击伤敌机七架。
    康开地区军民愤怒谴责美帝国主义野蛮杀害老挝无辜人民的滔天罪行，同时热烈欢呼自己的胜利。
