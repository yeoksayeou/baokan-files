A Black U.S. soldier in Vietnam has defected to the liberation zone. According to a report by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, a Black soldier in the U.S. forces in Vietnam, recognizing that "Johnson's war in South Vietnam is an aggressive war," recently bravely left the U.S. invading army and joined the liberation zone in South Vietnam. This soldier, named McKinley Nolan, also wrote a letter to Black soldiers in the U.S. forces in Vietnam, calling on them not to fight for the U.S. government, to take immediate action, and to join the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. McKinley Nolan was originally a sergeant in the A Company, 2nd Battalion, 16th Regiment, 1st Infantry Division of the U.S. Army. Upon arriving in the liberation zone in Long An Province southwest of Saigon, he was warmly welcomed by the local people.

    侵越美军一黑人士兵投奔解放区
    新华社河内十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：侵越美军中的一名黑人士兵，由于认识到“约翰逊（在南越）发动的战争是一场侵略战争”，最近毅然脱离美国侵略军，投奔越南南方解放区。这个名叫麦克金里诺兰的士兵还写信给侵越美军中的黑人士兵，呼吁他们不要为美国政府卖命，迅速采取行动，投奔越南南方民族解放阵线。麦克金里诺兰原是美国第一步兵师第十六团第二营A连的下士。他在到达西贡西南隆安省解放区时，受到当地人民热情的欢迎。
