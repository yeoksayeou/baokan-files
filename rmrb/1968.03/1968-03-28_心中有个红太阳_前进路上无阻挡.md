	The Red Sun in My Heart, No Obstacles on the Path Forward
	Soldier Bi Man Cang of the 4705 Unit, 3rd Company, People's Liberation Army

	Editor's Note: Comrade Bi Man Cang is a young soldier who has been in the army for over two years. He took on the task of supporting the leftist faction in a factory all by himself, and his work has been carried out with great success and effectiveness, earning him a commendation from his unit's party committee. Does he have any special skills? No. What he has is an unyielding heart that is loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. He follows Chairman Mao's instructions to the letter. He follows Chairman Mao's strategic deployments step by step. Whatever Chairman Mao says, he does.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." Every revolutionary soldier should strive to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, raising their class consciousness and their awareness of the line of struggle. With this awareness, any difficulty can be overcome, any storm of class struggle can be weathered, and any complex environment can be handled with ease.

	I enlisted in 1965. In June of last year, I was sent to the Tianjin South District's Curtain Cloth Factory to carry out leftist support work. In the more than half a year since then, I, along with all the revolutionary masses of the factory, have focused on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Production is booming. Currently, the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the Curtain Cloth Factory is deepening and developing, presenting a great and good situation.

	How have I studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions? I act as soon as I hear Chairman Mao's voice.

	Before going to the Curtain Cloth Factory, I supported agricultural work with my superiors and comrades. At that time, work was always smooth. Later, the leadership assigned me to the Curtain Cloth Factory to carry out leftist support work. I thought: I am a new soldier who has been in the army for less than two years, and now I am responsible for supporting a factory. Can I do it? Just as I was struggling with these thoughts, the political instructor said to me, "Little Bi, are you afraid of being a one-man show?" I nodded. The political instructor spoke earnestly, "Little Bi, you are not going to be a one-man show. You are going with Mao Zedong Thought. With the red sun in your heart, you have an army of a thousand and ten thousand." The red sun, the red sun! As soon as I heard these three words, my heart became clear, and my whole body felt warm. I immediately told the political instructor: With Mao Zedong Thought, I am not afraid of anything! I will definitely complete the mission. Before leaving, the political instructor also gave me a quote from Chairman Mao: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we must go, this is what a good comrade does." At that moment, I felt full of energy.

	Upon arriving at the Curtain Cloth Factory, before I could even catch my breath, a series of problems hit me all at once. Some came to complain to me, others to vent their grievances, some wanted my support, others wanted my stance, and there were also production issues, living issues, and so on.

	So many problems, where do I start? Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "Our country is a great socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a population of seven hundred million. It needs a unified, revolutionary, and correct ideology, and that is Mao Zedong Thought. With this ideology, we can maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit and have a firm and correct political direction." Following Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, I focused on propagating Mao Zedong Thought. I bought many portraits of Chairman Mao and hung them in the workshops and on the machines, so that everyone could see our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao at all times. To spread Chairman Mao's voice to everyone in a timely manner, I carried Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the "Old Five Articles" to the workshops, dormitories, and canteens, propagating and investigating as I went. For workers who were on sick leave and could not come to work, I went to their homes to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Although the workers lived scattered across five districts of Tianjin, I still used my days off to visit each household.

	One day after work, Chairman Mao's latest instructions from his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China were transmitted. I was very excited and wanted to immediately turn Chairman Mao's voice into the soul of the revolutionary masses of the Curtain Cloth Factory. However, at that time, the workers had all gone to watch a movie. Should I wait until the movie is over to transmit, or wait until the next day? Chairman Mao's latest instructions are great battle orders. For Chairman Mao's battle orders, we must act immediately, not a moment can be delayed! With this in mind, I took the latest instructions and ran to the movie theater. Fortunately, the movie had not started yet. I explained the situation to the theater staff, and they enthusiastically supported me. I then took the microphone and transmitted Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the revolutionary masses word by word. After coming out of the movie theater, I took a public bus back to the factory. I thought that Chairman Mao's latest instructions should be known to everyone, so I started propagating on the bus as well. The passengers, upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, were all excited. After arriving at the factory, I immediately printed Chairman Mao's latest instructions overnight. The next day, everyone received a copy. The workers, holding Chairman Mao's latest instructions, were all very excited and said, "This is truly the spring rain, the wind that sends the ship, the sun that never sets, the guiding light." At this moment, I became even clearer on how to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao. The standard is only one: to act as soon as I hear Chairman Mao's voice! Use Mao Zedong Thought to lead the masses, lead myself.

	Just as I was enthusiastically propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, I heard some feedback: "Little Bi is a strange person. He goes to every organization in the factory, and he supports every organization with all his might," "This person's banner is not clear, his attitude is not clear." These feedbacks put a lot of pressure on me, especially the phrase "banner is not clear." I repeatedly pondered these five words. What does it mean to have a clear banner? What banner should I have? I thought, it should be the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. I should propagate Mao Zedong Thought with all my might, following Chairman Mao's instructions to unite more than 95% of the masses and more than 95% of the cadres, uniting the thoughts of the masses on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. This is what it means to have a clear banner. With this in mind, I became more determined. No matter what feedback I received, I would still follow Vice Chairman Lin's instructions and focus on propagating Mao Zedong Thought as the foundation. I propagated during the day and at night. This continued for a long time, and the work of revolutionary great unity made significant progress.

	Just at this time, my eyes were red from strain, my toothache was unbearable, and half of my face was swollen. I was hospitalized. Although I was in the hospital, my thoughts were still in the Curtain Cloth Factory. I set a rule for myself: to call the factory once a day to propagate revolutionary great unity. Many revolutionary masses and leaders of mass organizations heard me speak with difficulty over the phone and advised me to rest well and not worry about the factory's affairs. They said, "The working class will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions." Many workers came to the hospital to visit me, and the leaders of various factions in the factory also came to visit me. I seized this opportunity to propagate the great significance of Chairman Mao's call for revolutionary great unity to them, enduring the pain. After repeated propagation, many workers and leaders of mass organizations were excited and said, "Little Bi! You can rest assured, we will propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions just like you, and we will follow Chairman Mao's instructions to the letter." They truly acted on their words. After returning to the factory, they propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions in large and small meetings, and in just a few days, they achieved revolutionary great unity throughout the factory. From this, I deeply felt that as long as we arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, we are not fighting alone, we have an army of a thousand and ten thousand, and we have an invincible power.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding the theory of Marxism, one must be able to master it and apply it. The purpose of mastering it is entirely for application." To arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, one must first arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought. Whether one applies it well or not is the fundamental criterion for a revolutionary soldier's loyalty to Chairman Mao. Therefore, I often use Chairman Mao's instructions as a standard, checking my thoughts against the factory's work, and seeing my shortcomings through the problems of the masses. After achieving revolutionary great unity throughout the factory, most of the masses could unite and work together, focusing on revolution and promoting production. However, a few people in the machine repair group still lacked enthusiasm. This matter caught my attention. Why did the vast majority of the masses actively promote revolution and production, while these few people lacked enthusiasm?

	At that time, some comrades said, "We have already united, and most of the people in the factory are active. Even if these few people lack enthusiasm, it won't affect the big picture." I heard this and initially thought that this made sense. After all, the work of most of the masses has been done, so what difference does it make if these few people lack enthusiasm? However, after studying Chairman Mao's great teachings of "uniting the broad masses of the people, the more the better," I immediately realized that this understanding was wrong. What is the big picture? Currently, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the biggest task. Our leftist support is not just about achieving unity, but about uniting the revolutionary masses to follow Chairman Mao and carry out the revolution, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions take root in everyone's mind and be implemented in everyone's actions. In this big picture, even if one person lacks enthusiasm, it shows that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have not been fully implemented; in this big picture, if one person lacks enthusiasm, it shows that our work of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is not yet complete. Thinking this way, I felt that although the problem was in this small group, the root was in myself. Chairman Mao's latest instructions had not been fully implemented in my mind.

	After raising my awareness, I immediately changed my previous phenomenon of having less study, less labor, and less heart-to-heart talks with this group due to emotional distance. First, I went to this group and thoroughly exposed and fought against my selfishness. I often went to this group and studied the latest instructions with them repeatedly. After a period of work, the machine repair group underwent great changes. Everyone consciously took Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, fought against selfishness, vigorously eradicated factionalism, and eliminated anarchism. Revolution and production were in full swing.

	Just as the situation in the factory was getting better and better, I heard someone behind me calling me "little old man." After investigation, the workers told me, "Your work is done well, it's just that you speak in a drawn-out voice and walk with your hands behind your back, which makes you look like an old man." When the workers explained it this way, I immediately realized the seriousness of the problem. Speaking in a drawn-out voice was to show that I was experienced, to show that I was great, to show that I knew a lot. In short, it was to show that I was different from the masses and more superior to others. I immediately studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be arrogant and self-satisfied." I realized that any achievements I had should be attributed to the great Mao Zedong Thought. I had made a mistake in my account, and raising my tail was the beginning of failure, which was disloyal to Chairman Mao. The problem had surfaced, and it could not be allowed to develop further. It had to be firmly suppressed. Following Chairman Mao's great teachings of "practicing open, mass self-criticism... and thoroughly correcting it," I made a sincere self-criticism at a mass meeting. To fight it to the end, I listed its crimes on a blackboard and hung it at the factory's gate, checking and correcting myself at any time, and letting the masses supervise me. I felt that this was not enough, so I set a system for myself: to seek opinions from various workshops and groups every half month; to make a comprehensive self-criticism to all the masses of the factory every month. In addition to the fixed system, I required all revolutionary workers of the factory to criticize and correct me at any time if they found any shortcomings or errors in my implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. I did this, and the workers did not treat me as an outsider. If they found any problem with me, even if it was just a wrong word, they would point it out to me at any time. Some, fearing to delay my work, would write their opinions on a piece of paper and give it to me after work or place it in my dormitory. From this, I deeply felt that establishing a genuine proletarian relationship with the broad masses, seeking their help at all times, is an important measure to accelerate my ideological transformation and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	Regarding Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must consciously and wholeheartedly follow it closely.

	Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is developing rapidly, and new revolutionary committees are sprouting up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Comparing the situation of the Curtain Cloth Factory, I felt that it was lagging behind. At that time, I saw in the newspaper the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which inspired and educated me. If the Curtain Cloth Factory also held Mao Zedong Thought study classes and tempered people's thoughts to be red, this would be the strongest force. Therefore, I shared my thoughts with everyone, and the workers were so happy that they jumped up. Some suggested ideas, and some proposed methods. In an instant, five types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held.

	After the study classes were held, the central content was to take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, achieve the revolutionary three-in-one combination through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and establish a revolutionary committee. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. This issue must be resolved." How to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on this? From my past practice, I felt that for any work, one must have sufficient ideological preparation and mobilization, and the most fundamental thing is to vigorously propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, I repeatedly organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's series of teachings on cadre policy and had heart-to-heart talks with masses who held different views, raising the awareness of the broad masses. Seeing that the thoughts of the masses were basically unified, I shifted the focus of the work to the cadres.

	The cadre team of the Curtain Cloth Factory is basically good, and the vast majority of cadres are from the working class and love the great leader Chairman Mao. Some cadres who made mistakes, through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the enthusiastic help of revolutionary masses, seriously checked and corrected their mistakes and stood up, taking on the heavy responsibility of promoting revolution and production. However, the first-in-command, Party branch secretary Yang Hengju, refused to step forward.

	Chairman Mao says: "Without investigation, there is no right to speak." Regarding Yang Hengju's situation, I conducted repeated investigations and research. From his entire history and work, he is not a capitalist-roader within the party, but a cadre who made mistakes and should be helped to recognize and correct his mistakes and stand up for the revolution. However, how to do his work? He is an old cadre with more than twenty years of party membership, while I am just a twenty-one-year-old kid. How can this new soldier convince this old cadre? It is indeed a difficult task. Difficult or not, I have to do it. Doing Yang Hengju's work is not just about the two of us, but about using Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line in his mind. I am a soldier of Chairman Mao, and implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is my duty. On this issue, I cannot make any conditions, otherwise, I cannot follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment closely. Thinking of this, I gained courage and strength, determined to do a good job on this!

	With a heart full of enthusiasm, I went to talk to Old Yang. The first time I went, he said nothing and gave me a cold shoulder; the second time I went, I studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with him, but he still ignored me and gave me a cold bench. To follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment closely, you are cold to me, but I am warm to you. I went to see him again and again. Unexpectedly, once his words started flowing, he poured out all his grievances. No matter how I guided him, he still did not check himself. Half a month had passed, and individual heart-to-heart talks had reached nearly twenty times. The study classes had also been held for more than ten sessions, but he still refused to check his mistakes.

	How to solve Old Yang's problem? I opened my legs and went to the masses to understand Yang Hengju's situation. The workers told me in detail about his sufferings in the old society and said that his two half-ears were frozen off while working for the capitalists. I thought, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." I decided to start with class education, arouse his class consciousness, guide him to recognize his mistakes, and help him stand up. Thus, the twenty-second heart-to-heart talk between Yang Hengju and me began.

	In this talk, we first studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, then exchanged our study notes, and I changed the topic, bringing the conversation to his half-ears, asking him about his ears. As soon as the matter of the ears was mentioned, the tragic scenes of the old society reappeared before Yang Hengju. Originally, he was from Shandong, and because he could not pay the rent to the landlord, he was forced to leave home at the age of thirteen to Tianjin. However, the capitalists in Tianjin were as cruel as the landlords in Shandong, making him work in single clothes in the dead of winter, tormenting him to the point of getting arthritis. His two ears were frozen off at that time. When he said this, I also talked about my family history, often hearing my mother talk about how in the old society, every Spring Festival, the family could not open the pot, the landlord's debt collectors were at the door, and they had to leave home to pass through the ghost gate. Old Yang and I are bitter gourds on the same vine! Our hands were tightly clenched together, and tears rolled down. Old Yang said, "It is the great leader Chairman Mao who saved us poor people from the sea of suffering and let us become masters of the house." I said, "Old Yang, how should we poor and lower-middle peasants repay Chairman Mao?" Old Yang stood up firmly and said, "Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do. Live to fight for Chairman Mao, die to dedicate to Chairman Mao." I said, "Right! But some comrades in our factory are not like this. Chairman Mao lets him be the master of the house, but he insists on throwing down his burden and not doing it. Do you think this is right?" Yang Hengju heard this and was silent for a long time. After a while, he said heavily, "I am ungrateful to Chairman Mao and the masses. I implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, and the revolutionary masses enthusiastically helped me, but I did not turn back. Instead, I decided not to be a cadre, forgetting my roots, throwing down my burden, which is the biggest selfishness." Finally, he said to me, "Little Bi, I want to check my mistakes to all the revolutionary workers of the factory." Seeing that he really understood, I happily said, "Good! I firmly support you."

	The next day, Old Yang's soul-stirring self-criticism was posted. The masses, after reading it, posted big-character posters one after another, welcoming him to stand up for the revolution. Yang Hengju was very moved and bravely stepped onto the stage again, making a deep self-criticism. Subsequently, he went to various workshops to expose his selfishness and fight against it, receiving a warm welcome from the revolutionary masses. Yang Hengju truly stood up with his actions. At the end of last year, the revolutionary committee of the Curtain Cloth Factory was born in glory, and Yang Hengju was elected as the chairman of the revolutionary committee.

	At the moment when all the revolutionary workers of the factory were joyfully celebrating the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, recalling my journey of fighting with the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, I deeply felt that this victory is inseparable from the step-by-step guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, inseparable from the line-by-line implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and inseparable from our red sun, Chairman Mao, who is the reddest in our hearts! With the red sun in our hearts, we have boundless strength, boundless wisdom, and boundless courage; with the red sun in our hearts, no difficulty can stop us, and no storm can change our direction. I am determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forever march forward in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao! Achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

专栏：

    心中有个红太阳　前进路上无阻挡
    人民解放军四七○五部队三连战士　边满仓
    编者按：边满仓同志是一位入伍两年多的青年战士。他一个人担负了一个工厂的支左任务，工作却开展得有声有色，卓有成效，受到了所在部队党委的通报表扬。他有什么特殊的本领？没有。他有的，只是一颗无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心。毛主席的指示，他句句照办。毛主席的战略部署，他步步紧跟。毛主席怎么说，他就怎么做。
    毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”每个革命战士，都应当努力活学活用毛泽东思想，提高阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。有了这种觉悟，任何困难都能克服，任何阶级斗争的风浪都能顶住，任何复杂的环境都能应付自如。
    我是一九六五年入伍的，去年六月到天津市南开区帘子布厂担任支左工作。在这半年多的时间里，我和全厂革命群众一起，狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓毛主席最新指示的落实，很快实现了全厂革命大联合和革命三结合。生产形势也蒸蒸日上。目前帘子布厂活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，正在不断地深入发展，呈现出一派大好景象。
    我是怎样活学活用毛主席著作，落实毛主席最新指示的呢？听到毛主席的声音就干
    我到帘子布厂之前，跟首长和战友们一起支农。那时候工作总是顺顺当当的。后来领导上把我调到帘子布厂去执行支左任务。我想：我是入伍不到两年的新兵，现在要负责一个厂子的支左工作，能行吗？正在我思想斗争激烈的时候，指导员对我说：“小边，是不是怕唱独角戏？”我“嗯”了一声。指导员语重心长地说：“小边，你不是去唱独角戏，你是带着毛泽东思想去的，心中有了红太阳，就有了千军万马。”红太阳，红太阳！我一听红太阳这三个字，心里顿时豁亮了，全身感到热呼呼的。我马上向指导员表示：有毛泽东思想，我什么也不怕！坚决完成任务。临出发时，指导员还送给我一条毛主席语录：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”这时，我觉得浑身是劲。
    到了帘子布厂，没等我歇个脚，劈头盖脑地来了一连串问题。这个向我“告状”，那个跟我“诉怨”，有的要我支持，有的要我表态，还有生产问题，生活问题，等等。
    这么多问题，从那里抓起？林副主席指示我们：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。有了这个思想，才能保持旺盛的革命干劲，才有坚定正确的政治方向。”我遵照林副主席的指示，狠抓宣传毛泽东思想。我买了许多毛主席像，端端正正贴在车间里，挂在机器上，让大家时时处处看到我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。为了把毛主席的声音及时传播给每一个人，我带着毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示和“老五篇”，走车间，串宿舍，进饭堂，边宣传，边调查。有的工人歇病假上不了班，我就到他们家里去宣传毛泽东思想。尽管工人们住得很分散，遍布天津市的五个区，我还是利用星期天，逐门逐户地进行访问。
    有一天下班后，毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时的最新指示传达下来，我听了心情非常激动，真想把毛主席的声音，立即化为帘子布厂广大革命职工的灵魂。可是，当时工人们都去看电影了。是散了电影再传达，还是等到第二天？毛主席的最新指示，就是伟大的战斗号令。对毛主席的战斗号令，就是要闻风而动，一刻也不能等！想到这里，我带着最新指示跑到了电影院。正好电影还没有开映，我跟影院的同志一说，得到了他们的热情支持。我便拿过话筒，一字一句地把毛主席的最新指示传达给广大革命群众。从电影院出来，我坐上公共汽车回厂。我想毛主席的最新指示应该让人人皆知、家喻户晓，于是就在公共汽车上也宣传开了，乘客们听到毛主席的最新指示，无不欢欣鼓舞。到厂后，我又连夜刻印了毛主席的最新指示。第二天人手一册，发给了全厂革命群众。工人们手捧毛主席的最新指示，都非常激动地说：“这真是春天的雨，送船的风，不落的太阳，指路的明灯。”这时我心里更明确了怎样才配做一个毛主席的好战士，标准只有一条，这就是：听到毛主席的声音就干！用毛泽东思想统帅群众，统帅自己
    正当我热情宣传毛主席最新指示的时候，听到了一些反映：“小边这人真怪，厂里四个组织，他那个组织也去，对那个组织也一个劲”，“这个人旗帜不鲜明，态度不明朗”。这些反映传到我耳朵里，对我的压力很大，特别是“旗帜不鲜明”，我反复琢磨这五个字。什么叫旗帜鲜明？要什么旗帜？我想，就是要毛泽东思想的旗帜，我下劲宣传毛泽东思想，按照毛主席关于团结百分之九十五以上的群众，团结百分之九十五以上的干部的指示，让几派群众的思想统一在毛泽东思想的基础上，这就是旗帜鲜明。想到这里，我心里踏实了，我下定决心，不管有什么反映，也要按照林副主席的指示，狠抓宣传毛泽东思想这一根本。白天宣传，夜晚也宣传。这样持续了很长时间，革命大联合工作有了很大的进展。
    正在这个时候，我的眼熬红了，牙痛得要命，半边脸肿得挺高挺高的，住了医院。人住了院，我的思想还在帘子布厂。我给自己规定了一条纪律，每天往厂里打一次电话，宣传革命的大联合。许多革命群众和群众组织的头头在电话里听我说话很困难，都劝我好好养病，不要为厂子的事操心。他们说：“工人阶级一定按毛主席的指示办事。”不少工人到医院来看我，厂里各派组织的头头也到医院来看我。我抓紧这个有利时机，忍着疼痛，向他们宣传毛主席号召革命大联合的伟大意义。经过反复宣传，许多工人和群众组织的头头都激动地说：“小边啊！你放心吧，我们一定象你这样宣传毛主席最新指示，不折不扣地按毛主席指示办事。”他们真是说了就办，回厂以后，大会小会都宣传毛主席最新指示，没隔几天就实现了全厂革命大联合。从这里，我深深体会到：只要坚持用毛泽东思想武装群众，我们就不是孤军作战，就有了千军万马，就有了无比强大的力量。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”用毛泽东思想武装群众，首先要用毛泽东思想武装自己。自己用得好不好，是革命战士忠不忠于毛主席的根本标志。所以，我经常以毛主席指示为标准，对照厂里的工作，检查自己的思想，透过群众身上的问题，看到自己的不足。在全厂实现革命大联合以后，全厂大多数群众都能团结一致，齐心协力，狠抓革命，猛促生产，可是机修小组里仍有几个人劲头不大。这件事引起了我的注意。为什么绝大多数群众都在积极地抓革命促生产，唯独这几个人差点劲？
    当时有的同志说：“我们已经联合了，全厂绝大多数人都动起来了，他们几个人差点劲，也碍不了大事。”我听到后，开始觉得这话说得满在理；可不是嘛，大多数群众的工作都做好了，这几个人差点劲又有什么关系？可是当我学习了毛主席“团结广大人民，团结得越多越好”的伟大教导以后，立刻意识到这种认识不对头。什么是大事？在当前，条条落实毛主席最新指示就是最大的事。我们支左决不只是为了搞联合，而是要让广大革命群众联合起来紧跟毛主席干革命，使毛主席的最新指示在每个人的头脑里扎根，在每个人的行动上落实。在这个大事面前，即使有一个人差点劲，也说明毛主席的最新指示还没有完全落实；在这个大事面前，有一个人差点劲，也说明我们落实毛主席最新指示的工作还没有完全做到家。这样一想，我觉得问题虽然出在这个小组，根子却在自己身上，毛主席最新指示还没有在自己头脑里完全落实。
    认识提高后，我立即改变了以前那种由于感情疏远而和这个小组一块学习少，一块劳动少，一块谈心少的现象。首先到这个小组狠亮狠斗自己的私心，经常到这个小组和他们一起反复学习最新指示。经过一段工作，机修小组发生了很大变化，大家自觉地以毛主席最新指示为纲，狠斗“私”字，猛铲派性，围歼无政府主义，革命、生产热火朝天。
    就在厂里形势一天比一天好的时候，我听到背后有人管我叫“小老头”。经过了解，工人对我说：“你的工作搞得不错，就是说话拉长声，走路背着手，不就象小老头了吗？”听工人这么一解释，我立刻意识到问题的严重性。拉长声，是为了显得自己老练，显得自己了不起，显得自己懂得多，一句话，就是显得自己与群众不同，比别人高明。我马上学习了毛主席的教导：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。”认识到自己取得的一些成绩都应该归功于伟大的毛泽东思想。自己记错了账，翘起了尾巴就是失败的开始，就是对毛主席的不忠。问题已经露头了，就不能叫它往下发展，就得把它坚决打下去。我遵照毛主席“实行公开的群众性的自我批评……而彻底改正之”的伟大教导，在群众大会上做了认真的检查。为了把它斗倒斗臭，我把它列出罪状写在黑板上，挂在工厂的大门口，一方面自己随时检查对照，一方面让群众监督改正。我觉得这还不够，又给自己规定了一套制度：每半个月到各个车间、班组征求一次意见；每一个月向全厂群众作一次全面检查。除固定制度外，我要求全厂革命职工，发现我在执行毛主席最新指示上有那些缺点错误，随时批评指正。我这样做了，工人也不把我当外人，发现我有一点问题，那怕是说错了一句话，都随时给我提出来。有的生怕耽误我的工作，把对我的意见写在纸条上，下班时交给我，或者放在我的宿舍里。从这里，我深深体会到，和广大群众建立真正的无产阶级感情，处处争取群众的帮助，是加速自己思想改造，不折不扣地落实毛主席最新指示的重要措施。对毛主席的伟大战略部署
    要自觉地全力紧跟
    在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，全国无产阶级文化大革命形势发展很快，新生的革命委员会象雨后春笋一样纷纷建立起来。我一对照帘子布厂的情况，感到有些落后。当时我看到报纸上发表的关于办好毛泽东思想学习班的经验，很受启发，很受教育。如果帘子布厂也把毛泽东思想学习班办起来，把人的思想炼得红红的，这就有了最强大的力量。于是，我把自己的想法告诉大家，工人们一听高兴得跳了起来，这个出主意，那个提办法，一下子，办了五种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。
    学习班办起来以后，中心内容是以毛主席最新指示为纲，通过斗私批修，实现革命的三结合，成立革命委员会。毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”怎样才能落实毛主席这一最新指示？我从以往的实践中体会到，进行任何一项工作，都要有充分的思想准备，要搞动员，而最根本的是大力宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。于是，我反复组织大家学习毛主席关于干部政策的一系列教导，又和持有不同观点的群众，一个个地谈心，提高了广大群众的觉悟。我一看群众的思想基本上一致了，就把工作的重心，转移到干部身上。
    帘子布厂的干部队伍基本上是好的，绝大多数干部都是劳动人民出身，是热爱伟大领袖毛主席的。有些犯错误的干部，通过学习毛主席最新指示和革命群众的热情帮助，认真地检查和改正了错误，纷纷站了出来，挑起了抓革命促生产的重担。可是，厂里的第一把手、党支部书记杨恒聚说什么也不往外站。
    毛主席说：“没有调查就没有发言权”。对杨恒聚的情况，我进行了反复的调查研究。从他的全部历史和全部工作来看，他不是党内走资派，而是犯了错误的干部，应该帮助他认识错误、改正错误，站出来革命。可是怎样做他的工作呢？人家是有二十多年党龄的老干部，我才是个二十一岁的毛孩子，人家的党龄比我的年龄都大；我这个新战士要做通这个老干部的思想工作，确实是个难题。难也得干。我做杨恒聚的工作，并不是我们俩人的事，而是要用毛主席的革命路线去肃清资产阶级反动路线在他头脑中的流毒。我是毛主席的战士，贯彻毛主席的革命路线是我的天职，在这个问题上不能讲任何条件，否则，就不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。想到这儿，我增添了勇气和力量，下定决心，一定要做好这个工作！
    我怀着满腔热情找老杨谈心。第一次找他，他不吭不哈地说：“没啥可谈”，给了我个软钉子；第二次我又去找他，和他一起学习毛主席的最新指示，他仍然带搭不理，给我个冷板凳。为了紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，你对我冷，我对你热。我接二连三地找他。没想到他的话匣子一打开，满肚子牢骚一个劲地往外倒。不管你怎么引导，他也不检查自己。半个月已经过去了，个别谈心都快二十次了，学习班也上了十来课，他还是不肯检查自己的错误。
    到底怎样解决老杨的问题呢？我迈开两条腿，到群众中去了解杨恒聚的情况，工人们把他在旧社会受苦的经过，原原本本地给我讲了一遍，并说，他那两只半截耳朵就是给资本家干活时冻掉的。我想，毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”我决定从阶级教育入手，启发他的阶级觉悟，引导他认识错误，帮助他站出来。这样，我和杨恒聚的第二十二次谈话开始了。
    这次谈话，我们俩先学习了毛主席的最新指示，接着交换了一下学习心得，我转了转话题，把话拉到他那两只半截耳朵上去了，问他的耳朵是怎么回事。一提耳朵的事，旧社会的悲惨情景，又浮现在杨恒聚眼前。原来，他老家在山东，因交不起地主的租子，被逼得十三岁就背井离乡到天津。可是天津的资本家和山东的地主一样狠，十冬腊月让他穿着单衣去干活，折磨得他得了关节炎，他那两只耳朵就是那时候冻掉的。当他说到这里的时候，我也说起了自己的家史，我经常听母亲讲在旧社会每年春节，家里揭不开锅，地主要债的不离门，只好背井离乡度过鬼门关。我和老杨是一根藤上的苦瓜呀！我俩的手紧紧攥在一起，泪珠滴答滴答滚了下来。老杨说：“是伟大领袖毛主席把我们穷人从苦海里救了出来，让我们当家做了主人。”我说：“老杨呀，咱们贫下中农应该怎样报答毛主席他老人家？”老杨站起来坚定地说：“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。生为保卫毛主席战斗，死为保卫毛主席献身。”我说：“对！可是咱们厂有的同志就不是这样，毛主席让他当家做主人，他偏偏想撂挑子不干，你说这种做法对不对？”杨恒聚一听，半天没吭声。过了好一会，才一字一板的，心情沉重地说：“我对不起毛主席，对不起群众。我执行了资产阶级反动路线，广大革命群众热情帮助我，可是我不回头，反而下决心不当干部了，我忘了本，撂挑子，是最大的私心。”最后他对我说：“小边呀，我要向全厂革命职工检查我的错误。”我看他真的通了，高兴地说：“好！我坚决支持你。”
    第二天，老杨触及灵魂的检查贴了出来。群众看了之后，纷纷贴出大字报，欢迎他站出来革命。杨恒聚很受感动，他又勇敢地登上讲台，再一次做了深刻检查。随后，又到各班组去亮私，斗私，受到革命群众的热烈欢迎。杨恒聚以他的实际行动，真正站出来了。去年年底，帘子布厂的革命委员会光荣诞生了，杨恒聚被选为革命委员会主任。
    在全厂革命职工喜气洋洋，共同欢呼毛泽东思想伟大胜利的时候，回忆我和无产阶级革命派一起战斗的历程，我深深体会到：这个胜利离不开毛泽东思想的步步指引，离不开毛主席最新指示的条条落实，离不开我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席！心中有个红太阳，就有了无穷的力量，无穷的智慧，无限的勇气；心中有个红太阳，任何困难无阻挡，大风大浪不转向。我决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远向着毛主席指引的方向前进！在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功！
