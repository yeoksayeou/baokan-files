A financial crisis sweeping through the capitalist world has left American-led imperialism reeling. In an attempt to save themselves, they are turning on each other, trying to drown their competitors, while at the same time targeting their own people, slashing into the broad masses of laborers. On March 16, Johnson announced a so-called "National Economy Plan," urging the American people to "tighten their belts." On March 19, the British Labour government proposed an "emergency budget," calling on the British people to make "hard sacrifices."

"Tighten your belts!" "Make hard sacrifices!" For what? The American President says: This is for the "national interest." The British Chancellor of the Exchequer says: Our goal is to make a major contribution to the "consolidation and healthy development of the international financial system." The gentlemen in Washington and London have concocted a fairy tale, telling the common people: We are all in the same boat, we should pull together; just endure a little!

This is sheer deception.

The people of the United States and Britain have no common interests with the monopolistic capital groups that exploit their blood and sweat, nor with the imperialists and colonialists who invade and plunder the peoples of other countries. The likes of Johnson singing about pulling together is merely to shift the financial and economic difficulties of imperialist countries onto the common people.

Lenin once pointed out: The result of "regulating economic life" in imperialist countries is to create military labor camps for workers (and part of the peasants) and build a paradise for bankers and capitalists. Their regulatory methods are to "tighten" the workers to the point of starvation. Isn't this exactly what American and British imperialism is doing now!

However, whether it is Johnson's "Economy Plan" or Wilson's "Emergency Budget," can these truly be the lifesavers for the financially and economically ailing United States and Britain? No. Implementing measures such as increasing taxes and freezing wages will inevitably lead to further shrinkage of the domestic market, and the hope of increasing exports will also inevitably fail due to fierce competition from other capitalist countries. The "magic solutions" from the White House and the Whitehall will not only fail to rescue the financial crisis of the United States and Britain but will only accelerate the arrival of the economic crisis.

The truly most important result of implementing this "tightening" policy is to further intensify class contradictions within the United States and Britain. Under the ruthless exploitation of American and British monopolistic capital, the broad masses of laboring people in the United States and Britain have already made enough sacrifices, and their belts have already been tightened enough. Now, the ruling classes of the United States and Britain are again slashing into them, which will inevitably provoke even stronger discontent and resistance from them.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own demise. The awakening of the masses of the people in the colonies and semi-colonies and the masses of the people within imperialist countries themselves is such a condition." The political awareness of the broad masses of laboring people in the United States and Britain will certainly be further heightened in the struggle against the worsening disaster policies of the American and British ruling classes. The conditions for the demise of American and British imperialism that they have prepared for themselves will be even more complete, and their days of demise will inevitably come even faster.

    帝国主义加紧给自己准备灭亡的条件
    本报评论员
    一场席卷资本主义世界的金融危机的风暴，把以美国为首的帝国主义打得晕头转向。它们为了挽救自己，一边互相倾轧，极力想把自己的竞争者淹死；一边就在本国人民身上打主意，向广大劳动群众开刀。三月十六日，约翰逊宣布了所谓“全国节约计划”，要美国人民“勒紧裤带”。三月十九日，英国工党政府提出了一项“危机预算”，要英国人民作出“艰苦牺牲”。
      “勒紧裤带”！“艰苦牺牲”！究竟是为了那一遭呢？美国总统说：这是为了“国家的利益”。英国财政大臣说：我们的目的是要“对国际金融体系的巩固和健全发展作出重大贡献”。华盛顿和伦敦的老爷们编造了一篇童话，他们向老百姓说：我们坐在一条船上，应当同舟共济；你们忍耐一下吧！
    这是彻头彻尾的欺骗。
    美国和英国的人民，同榨取他们血汗的垄断资本集团，同侵略和掠夺各国人民的帝国主义、殖民主义者，绝不存在什么共同利益。约翰逊之流唱起同舟共济的调子，无非是要把帝国主义国家的财政经济困难转嫁到老百姓身上罢了。
    列宁曾经指出：帝国主义国家“‘调节经济生活’的结果是给工人（和一部分农民）造成军事苦役营，给银行家和资本家建立起天堂。这些国家的调节办法就是把工人‘勒紧’，紧到挨饿的地步”。现在，美英帝国主义搞的不就正是这一套吗！
    然而，约翰逊政府的“节约计划”也好，威尔逊政府的“危机预算”也好，对于美国和英国的病入膏肓的财政经济说来，果真是什么救命灵丹吗？否。实行增加赋税、冻结工资等“紧缩”措施，势必要造成国内市场的进一步萎缩，而增加出口的如意算盘也必然会因为遇到其他资本主义国家的激烈竞争而落空。白宫和白厅的“锦囊妙计”，不但不能解救美国和英国的金融危机，而且只能加速经济危机的来临。
    实行这一套“勒紧”政策所造成的真正最重要的结果，就是使美国和英国国内阶级矛盾更加激化。在美英垄断资本的残酷剥削之下，美国和英国的广大劳动人民所作出的牺牲已经够多了，他们的裤带已经勒得够紧了。现在，美英统治集团又要向他们身上开刀，必然要激起他们更强烈的不满和反抗。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席说：“帝国主义给自己准备了灭亡的条件。殖民地半殖民地的人民大众和帝国主义自己国家内的人民大众的觉悟，就是这样的条件。”美国和英国广大劳动人民的政治觉悟，必将在反对美英统治集团变本加厉地实行灾难政策的斗争中更进一步提高。美英帝国主义给它们自己准备的灭亡的条件将更加充分，它们灭亡的日子也就必然要更快地到来。
