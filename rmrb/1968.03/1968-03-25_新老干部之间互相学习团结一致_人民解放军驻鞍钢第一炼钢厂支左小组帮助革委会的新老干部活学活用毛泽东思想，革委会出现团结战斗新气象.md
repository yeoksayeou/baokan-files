The People's Liberation Army support-left group stationed at Anshan Iron and Steel Company's First Steel Plant has enthusiastically assisted the revolutionary committee's new and old cadres in studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, fostering a new atmosphere of unity and struggle within the committee.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 20th: The People's Liberation Army support-left group stationed at Anshan Iron and Steel Company's First Steel Plant has enthusiastically assisted the revolutionary committee's new and old cadres in studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, establishing a new relationship between the new and old cadres.

After the revolutionary committee was established in this factory in January, some old cadres felt that they had made many mistakes in the past and that the new cadres were now supervising them, fearing that they might make even more mistakes. Therefore, they hesitated to speak openly to the new cadres and were cautious in their actions. Meanwhile, some new cadres did not understand the old cadres' feelings, suspecting that the old cadres harbored resentment and were not fully supportive. As a result, new and old cadres worked independently, leading to a lack of coordination in their work and hindering the smooth progress of the revolution and production. The support-left group, following Chairman Mao's directive that "our party, if it does not have a large number of new cadres working with old cadres in unity, our cause will be interrupted," approached this task with great enthusiasm and a strong sense of political responsibility. They helped the factory's revolutionary committee members study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, establishing a new relationship between the new and old cadres.

The support-left personnel first studied Chairman Mao's works "Rectification of the Party's Style of Work" and "Methods of Work of Party Committees," along with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using the method of small rectification to address the thoughts of the new and old cadres. Following Chairman Mao's teachings to "put problems on the table" and "each make self-criticism," they spoke from the heart, sincerely exchanging thoughts and feelings. This cleared up misunderstandings, resolved ideological knots, and fostered a spirit of mutual care, love, and support for a common revolutionary goal. This built a fighting friendship, uniting new and old cadres and creating a new atmosphere of unity and struggle within the committee.

Next, the support-left group helped initiate the "one helps one" and "one pair of reds" activities. The deputy chairman of the revolutionary committee and former factory director, Sun Meiwu, and the deputy chairman and new cadre, Han Zhongmin, formed a "pair of reds." Sun Meiwu had previously implemented a segment of the bourgeois reactionary line and had been criticized by the masses. After becoming deputy chairman, he feared making more mistakes and was hesitant in his work. Han Zhongmin noticed Sun Meiwu's ideological issues and studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with him: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." This helped Sun Meiwu further understand that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great mass socialist revolutionary movement. The masses giving cadres feedback is a sign of their care and support. Cadres must go among the masses to truly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Encouraged by Han Zhongmin, Sun Meiwu bravely took on the responsibility of leading the factory's production, frequently visiting the workshops, and solving problems with the workers. Once, the blast furnace workshop ran out of sintered ore, and to ensure normal steel production, Sun Meiwu decided to use natural ore as a substitute and explained the reasons and safety precautions to the workers. However, some workers did not understand and were unwilling to follow Sun Meiwu's method. The revolutionary committee's new cadres learned of this and believed Sun Meiwu's actions were correct and should be supported. They went to the workshop, understood the situation, did ideological work, organized the study of Chairman Mao's teachings on "grasp revolution, promote production" and "further economize and make revolution," and exchanged views with the workers who had objections. The problem was quickly resolved. The new cadres' strong support made Sun Meiwu work even more boldly.

When the support-left group helped the factory's revolutionary committee establish a new type of relationship between new and old cadres, they focused on doing good ideological and political work with the old cadres, encouraging them to wholeheartedly welcome the new cadres, care for them, turn their own lessons into the new cadres' experiences, and their own insights into the new cadres' practices. There was a new cadre who, due to not considering some issues thoroughly, caused some masses to have opinions about the revolutionary committee and this cadre. An old cadre who served as deputy chairman heard the feedback and immediately went to the masses to make a self-criticism, taking responsibility and explaining that the new cadre was unfamiliar with the situation and lacked work experience. They had problems mainly because the old cadres had not helped enough. On the other hand, he talked to this new cadre, using his own past work experiences to help him. The new cadre was deeply moved and sincerely checked with the masses, receiving their praise.

    新老干部之间互相学习团结一致
    人民解放军驻鞍钢第一炼钢厂支左小组帮助革委会的新老干部活学活用毛泽东思想，革委会出现团结战斗新气象
    据新华社沈阳二十日电　人民解放军驻鞍山钢铁公司第一炼钢厂支左小组热情帮助革命委员会的新老干部活学活用毛泽东思想，建立了新老干部之间崭新的关系。
    这个厂一月份成立了革命委员会以后，在“三结合”的领导班子中，有的老干部认为自己过去犯了许多错误，现在新干部就在眼前监督着自己，恐怕弄不好错上加错。因此，有话不能痛快地向新干部说，办事走一步向后看一看。而有些新干部对老干部的这种心情不理解，怀疑老干部对自己有怨气，不和自己一条心，有事也不愿去找老干部商量，这样，新老干部各敲各的鼓，各打各的锣，工作中不够协调，影响了抓革命、促生产的顺利进展。驻厂解放军支左小组遵照毛主席关于“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断”的教导，以满腔的热情和极大的政治责任感，帮助这个厂革命委员会的成员活学活用毛泽东思想，建立了新老干部之间崭新的关系。
    解放军支左人员首先和革命委员会成员一道学习了毛主席的光辉著作《整顿党的作风》、《党委会的工作方法》和毛主席的最新指示，以小整风的方法整顿了新老干部的思想。大家按照毛主席“要把问题摆到桌面上来”，“各自多做自我批评”的教导，讲心里话，诚恳地谈心、交心。双方消除了误会，解开了思想疙瘩，为了共同的革命目标，互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，建立了战斗的友谊，新老干部团结一致，革委会出现了团结战斗的气象。
    接着，解放军支左小组又帮助大家开展了“一帮一”、“一对红”活动，革委会副主任委员、原厂长孙梅伍和革委会副主任委员、新干部韩忠民结成了“一对红”的对子。孙梅伍执行过一段资产阶级反动路线，受过群众的冲击，担任副主任委员以后，怕再犯错误，一度思想上有顾虑，工作不够大胆。韩忠民看出了孙梅伍的思想问题，就和他一起学习毛主席的最新指示：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”帮助他进一步认识到，无产阶级文化大革命是一场伟大的群众性的社会主义革命运动，群众给干部提意见，正是关心和爱护干部的表现。干部只有到群众中去，才能真正站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。在韩忠民的鼓励下，孙梅伍大胆挑起了领导全厂生产的重担，经常深入车间，和群众一起发现问题，解决问题。一次，平炉车间正常生产使用的烧结矿一时供应不上，为了保证炼钢生产正常进行，孙梅伍决定用天然矿代替烧结矿，并且到现场向工人们讲清了道理和安全注意事项。但部分工人思想不通，不愿按孙梅伍提出的办法干。革委会的新干部知道后，认为孙梅伍的做法是对的，应该大力支持。他们深入到车间，边了解情况边做思想工作，组织大家学习毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”、“要进一步节约闹革命”的教导，找有意见的工人交换意见，问题很快得到解决。新干部的大力支持，使孙梅伍以后工作更加大胆。
    驻厂解放军支左小组在帮助厂革委会新老干部建立新型的关系时，把工作的重点放在做好老干部的思想政治工作上，启发老干部以极大的热忱欢迎新干部，关心新干部，把自己的教训变为新干部的经验，把自己的体会变为新干部的实践。有一个新干部，因为有些问题考虑不周，使部分群众对革命委员会和这个干部产生了意见。一个担任副主任委员的老干部听到反映以后，就一面到群众中去做检查，主动承担责任，说明新干部对情况不熟悉，又缺乏工作经验，他们有问题，主要是老干部平时帮助不够。一方面又找这个新干部谈，用自己过去工作中的教训来帮助他。这个新干部很受感动，就认真向群众作了检查，得到了群众的好评。
