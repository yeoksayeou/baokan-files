A financial storm, the largest in forty years, is fiercely striking the capitalist world, shaking the entire capitalist system. This marks the further deepening of the capitalist political and economic crisis, and the decaying and declining imperialist system is accelerating its demise.

The trigger for this crisis is the collapse of the dollar's position as the pillar of the capitalist world's monetary system. The U.S. empire's long-term, maddened pursuit of aggression and expansion has left the U.S. treasury empty and its reserves depleted, making the dollar's position increasingly weak. The prolonged and massive drain of the Vietnam War has further accelerated the dollar's collapse. In this context, since the beginning of this year, the Western financial markets have repeatedly seen waves of dumping dollars and pounds and buying gold. The buying spree that began at the end of February and the beginning of March has been like a flood breaking through a dam, unstoppable. London, Paris, Zurich, and other major Western financial markets have fallen into unprecedented chaos; the chaos in the financial markets has also led to chaos in the stock and commodity markets. Facing disaster, the monopolistic capitalist groups in the West are in a state of panic, and the bourgeois press is filled with lamentations.

In this fierce storm of crisis, the U.S. imperialism is the first to be hit the hardest. The U.S. monopolistic capitalists are in a state of panic and disorder, with the domestic stock and commodity markets in great turmoil.

At the same time that the gold-buying frenzy was sweeping through the European financial markets, the U.S. domestic market also experienced violent fluctuations. Due to U.S. laws prohibiting individuals from holding gold, some big capitalists withdrew their funds from the domestic market and invested in the European market to buy gold, while other capitalists and speculators rushed to buy platinum, silver, and other precious metals, as well as gold and silver jewelry, to minimize their losses when the dollar officially devalues. Due to the "frenzied" buying of goods in the commodity market and the extreme instability of the dollar's value, many financial and trading centers in the West have suspended operations, and the commodity trading in New York and Chicago, the two largest cities, has been basically paralyzed.

Facing the dire situation of the dollar's position and the entire capitalist world's monetary system on the brink of collapse, the U.S. ruling class is in a state of chaos and panic. The Johnson administration first tried to use hollow statements like "defending the dollar's position" to calm the situation. On the night of the 14th, it hastily adopted a series of "emergency measures," including closing the London gold market, canceling the gold backing of the domestic dollar, and raising the bank discount rate, followed by convening a two-day emergency meeting in Washington on the 16th with representatives of the major capitalist countries in Western Europe to decide to effectively abolish the "gold pool" used to defend the dollar's position and allow the dollar to devalue in the Western market.

The center of the gold-buying storm is the London gold market, the total market for gold trading in the capitalist world. Since the end of February and the beginning of March, the gold-buying frenzy in the London gold market has been getting more intense every day; by the 14th, the gold trading volume in the London market reached about four hundred tons, tens of times the normal trading volume. The ferocity and duration of this buying spree are unprecedented. Under the fierce impact of this storm, the U.S. could no longer care about the "credit" of the dollar and hastily requested that Britain close the gold market from the 15th onwards, stopping private individuals from exchanging dollars for gold.

Due to the uncertain future of the pound and the dollar, those holding these two currencies, unable to buy gold, turned to buying silver and tin, rubber, and other commodities, causing a sharp rise in the prices of these commodities. After the gold market was closed, Britain, fearing that the buying spree for various commodities would become more intense, simply closed the markets for silver, tin, rubber, cocoa, coffee, flour, timber, sugar, and other commodities.

In this gold-buying storm, rumors of the pound's devaluation are becoming more rampant. The panicked British government, fearing further chaos in the financial markets and heavier pressure on the pound, closed the foreign exchange market at the same time as the gold market and ordered banks to "take a holiday."

The French ruling class, while secretly rejoicing at the repeated attacks on the dollar's position as it competes with the U.S., is also very concerned that the serious consequences of the dollar's collapse in the entire capitalist world will affect France.

In the Paris gold market, the gold-buying frenzy was also unprecedentedly fierce. The trading volume on the 14th reached 260 million francs, more than fifty times the daily trading volume. After the London and other Western gold markets were closed, merchants from all over the capitalist world rushed to Paris like hungry wolves to buy gold, causing "great chaos" and turning the gold market into a "free-for-all." During the buying frenzy, the gold price in Paris once soared to $44 per ounce, far higher than the official price of $35 per ounce.

The French bourgeois press pointed out uneasily that the current financial crisis is not only a disaster for the U.S. but also a serious threat to France. *Le Figaro* commented on the 18th that the soaring gold price is equivalent to the "great devaluation" of all Western currencies. Whether it is the dollar or the franc, now they can only exchange for less gold, and this will continue to decrease. French bourgeois economists are worried that the devaluation of the dollar will harm the economies and trade of all Western countries, including France.

Facing this critical situation, French President Charles de Gaulle held special cabinet meetings on the 13th and 15th to discuss how to deal with the current financial crisis in the Western world. French Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de Murville issued a statement on the 15th, calling on the "Common Market" countries in Western Europe to "coordinate their attitudes towards major issues such as the pound, the dollar, and gold."

The West German ruling class, which boasts of its "strong" economic power, is also trembling with fear and anxiety in the face of this capitalist world financial crisis. They are deeply afraid that if the dollar devalues, not only will West Germany suffer losses due to holding a large amount of dollars, but the West German Mark, which is closely related to the dollar, will also be affected, dealing an extra blow to the West German economy, which is already on the decline.

According to reports, the gold and foreign exchange markets in Frankfurt, West Germany, are also becoming "increasingly unstable" with the dumping of dollars and buying of gold. Out of common interests, the West German central bank had to step in to buy dollars to "maintain dollar credit" as the dollar's exchange rate continued to fall. On the other hand, the West German authorities are also concerned about holding too many dollars, fearing that they will suffer heavy losses if the dollar officially devalues. Therefore, on the 12th, they announced an increase in the short-term exchange rate for dollars to West German Marks to limit the inflow of a large amount of dollars into West Germany. This reflects the West German authorities' lack of confidence in the dollar's position. West German Finance Minister Kai-Uwe von Hassel spoke anxiously on the 16th about the possibility of the dollar's devaluation and admitted that at that time, the West German Mark would also "not hold up," and West Germany would "be forced to suffer the consequences we have tried to avoid." The West German *Welt* newspaper also pointed out uneasily that the devaluation of the dollar would "severely impact Germany's exports and the entire German economy." It recalled with horror that the devaluation of the pound last November had already reduced West German exports by 10%, and the devaluation of the dollar would further worsen West German export trade.

In other Western capitalist countries, from the Nordic countries to Southern Europe's Italy, from North America's Canada to Oceania's Australia and New Zealand, all have been hit by this massive wave of dumping dollars and pounds and buying gold. At its peak, due to the extreme distrust of the dollar, the foreign exchange markets in many countries suspended operations, and banks did not handle foreign exchange business. The Netherlands, Switzerland, and other countries temporarily restricted foreign tourists from exchanging dollars and pounds for local currency, and some countries outright refused to accept dollars to prevent losses from the dollar's devaluation.

Currently, this massive and profound financial and monetary crisis in the capitalist world is fiercely shaking the entire capitalist system. The ruling classes of capitalist countries sense that the end of the capitalist system is approaching and are in a state of anxiety and fear, unable to rest.

The malignant development of the financial crisis in the capitalist world and its heavy blow to the imperialist countries once again prove the great teacher of the world proletariat, Chairman Mao's teaching: "This enemy's foundation is weak, it is internally divided, it is detached from the people, it has an economic crisis that cannot be resolved, therefore, it can be defeated."

    金融危机风暴横扫西欧北美猛撼资本主义体系
    帝国主义日薄西山　西方世界一片慌乱
    资本主义政治经济总危机进一步深化
  　腐朽没落的帝国主义制度加速走向衰亡
    据新华社二十日讯　本社记者报道：一场四十年来最大的金融危机正在猛烈地冲击着资本主义世界，震撼整个资本主义体系。这标志着资本主义政治经济总危机的进一步深化，腐朽、没落的帝国主义制度正在加速走向衰亡。
    触发这场危机的导因，是作为资本主义世界货币体系支柱的美元地位的破产。美帝在全世界长期疯狂实行侵略、扩张政策的结果，使美国国库空虚、储备枯竭，美元地位日趋虚弱；而侵越战争长期、大量地吞噬着美国有限的财力、物力，更加加速了美元地位的崩溃。正是在这种情况下，今年以来，西方金融市场上一再爆发争相抛售美元英镑、抢购黄金的风潮。二月底、三月初以来的这次抢购风潮，更是势如决堤之水，一发不可收拾，伦敦、巴黎、苏黎世等西方重要的金融市场陷于空前混乱状态；金融市场的混乱还导致了股票市场和商品市场的混乱。灾难临头，西方各国垄断资本集团惊惶万状，资产阶级报刊发出一片悲鸣。
      危机风暴袭来，美帝
  首当其冲
    在这场猛烈的危机风暴中，美帝国主义首当其冲地受到了最强烈的冲击。美国垄断资本一片惊惶失措，国内股票、商品市场陷于极大紊乱。
    在西欧金融市场黄金抢风猛刮的同时，美国国内市场也发生了激烈的动荡。由于美国法律规定私人不得持有黄金，一些大资本家把他们的资金从国内抽走，投入西欧市场，参加抢购黄金，其他许多资本家和投机商则纷纷把手中的美元用来抢购国内市场上的白金、白银等贵重金属，甚至金银首饰等商品，以求在美元正式贬值时少受损失。由于商品市场上抢购物资到了“狂热的程度”以及在美元币值极其不稳的情况下，西方许多金融、贸易中心纷纷停市，纽约和芝加哥两大城市的商品交易也一度基本上陷于瘫痪状态。
    面对着美元地位以及整个资本主义世界金融货币体系濒于彻底崩溃的险恶局势，美国统治集团焦头烂额、手忙脚乱。约翰逊政府先是企图用几纸“坚决保卫美元地位”之类的空洞声明来稳住人心。十四日夜间又匆忙采取了一系列“应急措施”，其中包括关闭伦敦黄金市场、取消国内美元的黄金保证，提高银行贴现率等，接着又在十六日召集西欧主要资本主义国家的垄断资本代表到华盛顿举行两天紧急会议，作出了实际上取消用以保卫美元地位的“黄金总库”、听任美元在西方市场上贬值的决定。
      伦敦市场一片抢风，
  垄断资本乱作一团
    抢购黄金的风暴中心是资本主义世界黄金买卖的总市场——伦敦黄金市场。从二月底、三月初以来，伦敦黄金市场上的抢风一天猛似一天；到十四日这一天，伦敦市场上的黄金成交量高达四百吨左右，超出正常销售量好几十倍。这次抢购风潮来势之猛，持续时间之长，都是空前的。在这股抢风的猛烈冲击下，美国再也顾不得美元的“信用”，赶忙要求英国从十五日起关闭黄金市场，停止私人用美元兑换黄金。
    由于英镑、美元地位朝不保夕，持有这两种货币的人在抢购不到黄金的情况下，就转而抢购白银及锡、橡胶等各种物资，从而引起这些商品价格的猛涨。黄金市场关闭后，英国担心抢购各种商品的风暴将越刮越猛，便索性把白银、锡、橡胶、可可、咖啡、面粉、木材、糖等各种商品的市场都一古脑儿关闭了。
    在这次抢购黄金的风暴中，英镑将再次贬值的传闻越来越盛。仓惶失措的英国政府，由于害怕金融市场进一步混乱，害怕英镑受到更加沉重的压力，在关闭黄金市场的同时，把外汇交易所也关闭了，并下令银行“休假”。
      巴黎金价暴涨，当局
  亟谋对策
    法国统治集团由于同美国正在加紧争霸，对美元地位一再遭到猛烈冲击幸灾乐祸，并且暗中推波助澜；但是，另一方面它也非常担心，由于美元垮台而在整个资本主义世界引起的严重后果将使法国遭殃。
    在巴黎黄金市场上，抢购黄金的风潮也空前猛烈。十四日的成交额达到二亿六千多万法郎，等于平日成交额的五十多倍。在伦敦和其他一些西方黄金市场关闭后，来自资本主义世界各地的商人象饿狼一样扑向巴黎。据西方通讯社报道，他们“用拳头开路”，冲进巴黎黄金市场进行抢购，从而引起了“一片大混乱”，使黄金市场成了“大打出手的场所”。在抢购高潮中，巴黎的黄金价格曾一度猛增到四十四美元一盎司，远远高于三十五美元一盎司的官价。
    法国资产阶级报刊舆论不安地指出，目前这场金融危机，不仅是美国的灾难，也是对法国的严重威胁。《费加罗报》十八日在评论中指出，金价飞涨，事实上“等于一切（西方）货币的大大贬值”。不论是美元或法郎，现在都“只能换到较少的黄金”，而且将越来越少。法国的资产阶级经济学家担心，美元的贬值，势将损害包括法国在内的所有西方国家的经济和贸易。
    面对着这种危急局势，法国总统戴高乐在十三日和十五日接连召开内阁特别会议，商讨如何应付当前西方世界的金融危机问题。法国外长德姆维尔十五日发表谈话，呼吁西欧“共同市场”国家“共同协调它们对英镑、美元和黄金等重大问题的态度”。
      美元殃及马克，西德
  忧心忡忡
    自恃经济实力“雄厚”的西德统治集团，在这次资本主义世界的金融危机面前，也是胆颤心惊、忐忑不安。他们深恐美元一旦贬值，不仅将使西德因储有大量美元而蒙受损失，而且同美元有密切关系的西德马克也将受到连累，使正走下坡路的西德经济遭受额外的打击。
    据报道，在西德法兰克福黄金和外汇市场上，抛售美元抢购黄金的风潮也“越来越不平静”。出于共同利益的考虑，在美元牌价不断下跌的情况下，西德中央银行不得不出来收购美元，以“维持美元信用”；但另一方面，西德当局又担心手头美元过多，一旦美元正式贬值，遭受损失太大，因此，在十二日宣布提高美元兑换西德马克的短期兑换率，以限制大量美元进入西德。这反映了西德当局对美元地位十分缺乏信心。西德财政部长施特劳斯十六日就恐慌地谈到美元贬值的可能性，并承认到那时候，西德马克也就“顶不住了”，西德将“被迫蒙受我们尽力希望避免的后果”。西德《世界报》也不安地指出，美元的贬值，将使“（西）德国的出口和整个（西）德国经济遭受严酷的打击”。它心有余悸地谈到，去年十一月的英镑贬值，已经使西德出口减少了百分之十，美元贬值，将使西德出口贸易更加恶化。
      金融危机急速发展，
  西方世界日暮途穷
    在其他西方资本主义国家，从北欧国家到南欧的意大利，从北美的加拿大到大洋洲的澳大利亚、新西兰，都毫无例外地受到了目前这股抛售美元英镑、抢购黄金的巨大浪潮的冲击。在最高潮时，由于对美元的极度不信任，许多国家外汇市场都停止营业，银行也不办理外汇业务。荷兰、瑞士等国一度限制外国游客用美元、英镑兑换本国货币，有的国家干脆拒收美元，以预防美元贬值时受到损失。
    目前，这场资本主义世界巨大而深刻的金融货币危机正在猛烈地震撼着整个资本主义制度。资本主义各国的统治集团预感到资本主义制度的末日日益临近而坐立不安，惶惶不可终日。
    资本主义世界恶性发展的金融危机以及它给帝国主义各国的沉重打击，再一次证明了世界无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的教导：“这个敌人的基础是虚弱的，它的内部分崩离析，它脱离人民，它有无法解脱的经济危机，因此，它是能够被战胜的。”（附图片）
