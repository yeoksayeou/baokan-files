Since the New Year, nearly 360,000 people have risen up to fight, closely cooperating with the People's Liberation Armed Forces to launch fierce offensives against the U.S. puppet regime, smashing the enemy's ruling apparatus, and seizing power.

From January 31 to February 19, nearly 360,000 people in the Central Region rose up to fight, overthrowing many urban and rural puppet regimes in this area.
