The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Hunan's rural areas are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and have launched a spring plowing and production campaign.

At present, the revolutionary and production situation in Hunan's rural areas is exceptionally good and is getting better and better. From the banks of Dongting Lake to the foothills of the Wuling Mountains, the revolutionary tide rolls forward, and the spring plowing and production is in full swing. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres, under the red sun, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles," singing "The East Is Red" and "The Ship of the Great Sea Navigates by the Helmsman," have joined the spring plowing battle. Since last winter, the ten million water conservancy projects completed across the province are now gradually being completed. The activities of accumulating and fermenting fertilizer are in full swing. Some areas have already started leveling the seedbeds, selecting and drying seeds, and some have already started soaking seeds and raising seedlings.

The preparatory committee of the provincial revolutionary committee recently held a mobilization meeting for the entire province to grasp revolution and promote production, launching a spring plowing and production campaign. The preparatory committee of the provincial revolutionary committee, the 69000th Unit of the PLA, and the Hunan Military Region issued the "Urgent Mobilization Order to Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Grasp Revolution, Promote Production, and Immediately Launch a Spring Plowing and Production Campaign" and the "Decision on Resolutely Implementing Chairman Mao's Great Instruction of 'Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture.'" Provincial-level organs are dispatching more than half of their cadres to the front lines of agricultural production.

The outstanding feature of Hunan's rural spring plowing and production this year is that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have launched a more extensive movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and grasp the use of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They have participated in various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Since last winter and this spring, according to incomplete statistics, nearly seven million people in the rural areas of the province have participated in the study. In various places, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles," and fiercely criticize the revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev such as the theory of "class struggle extinction," "exploitation is beneficial," "three freedoms and one contract," and "four freedoms." This has greatly promoted the revolutionization of thought and further strengthened the resolve to follow the socialist path. Good deeds that firmly safeguard collective interests and consolidate and expand the collective economy are constantly emerging. With the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, a large number of revolutionary cadres have taken on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. Many leaders of revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary cadres have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the great policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production," further implemented the plan to achieve a great harvest this year, and launched a spring plowing and production campaign.

In this year's spring plowing and production, various places have launched a new high tide of learning from Dazhai.

Facing an exceptionally good situation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Hunan's rural areas always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and always be vigilant against the sabotage plots of a handful of class enemies. During the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies in Huachong County came out, using the counter-revolutionary tactic of "waving the red flag to oppose the red flag," attempting to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, timely exposed their counter-revolutionary plots and wielded the iron fist of proletarian dictatorship, making these reactionaries suffer in the revolutionary flames. Through this struggle, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have further solidified their belief that following Chairman Mao's words and walking the socialist path is victory. They are determined to be the pioneers of the rural Cultural Revolution and models of "grasping revolution and promoting production." Now, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in this county are full of enthusiasm, and the situation is exceptionally good.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who are responsible for the "three supports and two militaries" tasks, have formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, gone deep into communes and production teams to assist in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In promoting revolution and production, they have again achieved new merits. The support-left forces stationed in Zhuzhou County, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," have formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, gone deep into all eight districts of the county to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and lived, worked, and studied with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres. They have quickly established and improved revolutionary leading bodies at all levels, and the revolution and production in the entire county are in full swing.

    湖南农村革命和生产形势空前大好
    近七百万人参加毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，促进思想革命化，掀起春耕高潮
    据新华社长沙二十四日电　湖南农村广大贫下中农和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，掀起了春耕生产热潮。
    目前，湖南农村革命、生产形势空前大好，越来越好。从洞庭湖滨，到五岭山下，革命洪流滚滚向前，春耕生产热气腾腾。广大贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，迎着红太阳，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和“老三篇”，高唱《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》，投入春耕战斗。去冬以来全省兴修的十万处水利工程，现已陆续竣工。积肥沤肥活动正在热烈展开。部分地区已在平整秧田，选种晒种，有的已经浸种育秧。
    省革命委员会筹备小组最近召开了全省抓革命促生产、掀起春耕生产高潮动员大会，省革命委员会筹备小组、解放军六九○○部队、湖南省军区发布了《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，立即掀起春耕生产高潮的紧急动员令》和《关于坚决贯彻执行毛主席“农业学大寨”伟大指示的决定》。省级机关正抽调一半以上的干部，奔赴农业生产第一线。
    湖南农村今年春耕生产的突出特点是：广大贫下中农和革命干部更广泛地掀起活学活用毛主席著作，全面落实毛主席最新指示的伟大群众运动，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅生产。广大贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，纷纷参加各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。去冬今春以来，据不完全统计，全省农村已有近七百万人参加了学习。各地广大贫下中农和革命干部在毛泽东思想学习班里以“斗私，批修”为纲，反复学习毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义黑货，大大促进了思想革命化，更加坚定了走社会主义道路的决心。坚决维护集体利益、巩固和扩大集体经济的好人好事不断涌现。在贫下中农和革命群众的帮助下，大批革命干部挑起革命和生产两副重担。不少地区的革命群众组织负责人和革命干部认真学习了毛主席的最新指示和“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，进一步落实了夺取今年农业大丰收的规划，掀起了春耕生产高潮。
    在今年的春耕生产中，各地广大贫下中农和革命干部，掀起了学大寨的新高潮。
    湖南农村广大贫下中农和革命干部，面临一派空前大好形势，时刻牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，大力加强无产阶级专政，时刻警惕一小撮阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。华容县在文化大革命高潮中，一小撮阶级敌人跳了出来，以打着“红旗”反红旗的反革命两面手法，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命。广大贫下中农和革命干部以毛泽东思想这个锐利武器，及时揭露了他们的反革命阴谋，挥起无产阶级专政的铁拳，使这一小撮反动家伙在革命的火阵中烧得焦头烂额。广大贫下中农和革命干部通过这场斗争，更进一步坚信听毛主席的话，走社会主义道路就是胜利。他们决心做农村文化大革命的闯将，当“抓革命，促生产”的模范。现在这个县的革命群众和革命干部干劲十足，形势空前大好。
    担负“三支”“两军”任务的中国人民解放军广大指战员，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入社、队协助举办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，在抓革命促生产中又立下了新功。驻株洲县支左部队，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，分别深入全县八个区大办毛泽东思想学习班，和广大贫下中农、农村干部同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习，迅速建立、健全各级革命领导班子、全县革命和生产一派热气腾腾。
