The revolutionary committee of Bulitun Commune in Miyun County, Beijing, has, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, taken revolutionary measures to go deep into the grassroots, implement the "five together" policy with poor and lower-middle peasants, and significantly promoted spring plowing production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the revolutionary committee of Bulitun Commune in Miyun County, Beijing, has, in the current busy spring plowing season, thoroughly changed its bureaucratic work style, shifted the focus of work to the production teams, and implemented the "five together" policy with poor and lower-middle peasants, effectively promoting the development of revolution and production.

With the arrival of the busy spring plowing season, both revolution and production have become more hectic. In this situation, how can we further grasp the revolution and promote production? The revolutionary committee of Bulitun Commune widely solicited the opinions of poor and lower-middle peasants and brigade and production team cadres, and held discussions with all commune cadres. The unanimous opinion was: although the revolutionary committee of the commune has achieved some results in revolutionization, it has not done enough in going deep among the poor and lower-middle peasants and relying on them. With the help of the PLA's support-left team, the revolutionary committee organized all cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related teachings on going deep among the masses and learning from the masses, and extensively discussed this issue. The following measures were taken:

1. Shift the focus of work to the production teams. Except for leaving one person at home to take care of daily work, all commune cadres went down to the grassroots, divided into areas and points to help brigades and production teams with their work. Matters that can be handled down there should not be brought to the commune; meetings that can be held down there should not be held in the commune.

2. Implement the "five together" policy with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, eating together, living together, working together, studying together, and fighting together. In everything, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from them, and participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes with them, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism together. Cadres who go down should follow Chairman Mao's instructions, consult with the masses on everything, study Mao's instructions together when there are differing opinions, use Mao Zedong Thought as the criterion, unify thoughts, and then make decisions.

3. Break away from the past mechanical division of labor, regardless of what kind of work personnel, first of all, are propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and fighters who execute and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Cadres who go down, whether they are in charge of ideological and political work or production business work, should grasp the fundamentals, put learning, executing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought in the first place in all work, and according to unified steps and plans, grasp all work.

After these measures were formulated, the leaders of the commune revolutionary committee took the lead in implementing them. The commune's main responsible person, who was assigned to a brigade less than 200 meters away from the commune, moved his luggage to the home of a poor and lower-middle peasant, implemented the "five together" policy with them, and did not return to the commune unless there was an urgent matter. Other deputy heads and committee members, when they had to return to the commune, no matter how late it was, would return to the brigade if possible. The commune cadres were full of spirit and enthusiasm, many matters that were previously handled in the commune were now handled on the spot, reducing the levels and greatly improving work efficiency. Under the joint efforts of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in this commune were more widely opened, revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination were more consolidated and developed, revolutionary great criticism was being carried out in depth and for a long time, and a vigorous spring plowing production upsurge had been launched.

    改变领导作风把工作重点放到生产队
    北京市密云县不老屯公社革委会在解放军帮助下，采取革命化措施，深入基层，同贫下中农实行“五同”，大大促进了春耕生产
    据新华社讯　北京市密云县不老屯公社革命委员会，在当前春耕大忙中，彻底改变机关化的工作作风，将工作重点放到生产队，公社干部和贫下中农实行“五同”，有力地促进了革命和生产的发展。
    随着春耕大忙季节到来，革命和生产更加繁忙，在这样的情况下，如何进一步抓好革命，促好生产？不老屯公社革命委员会广泛征求了贫下中农和大队、生产队干部的意见，召集全体公社干部进行了讨论。大家共同的意见是：公社革命委员会在革命化方面虽已做出一些成绩，但是深入贫下中农，依靠贫下中农，还做得不够。公社革命委员会在解放军支左部队帮助下，组织全体干部反复学习毛主席的最新指示和有关深入群众、向群众学习的教导，广泛讨论了这个问题，并采取了以下几项措施：
      一、将工作重点放到生产队。全公社干部除留一人在家照顾日常工作以外，全部下到基层去，分片分点帮助大队、生产队工作。能在下面办的事，就不到公社来办；能在下面开的会，就不到公社来开。
    二、同广大贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同战斗，坚持实行“五同”。事事处处依靠贫下中农，向贫下中农学习，同贫下中农一起参加毛泽东思想学习班，一起斗私批修。下去的干部，要遵照毛主席的教导，遇事多同群众商量。研究问题、决定问题，首先征求贫下中农和队干部的意见；意见不同，共同学习毛主席的指示，以毛泽东思想为指针，统一思想，再作决定。
    三、打破过去机械分工的框框，不论是什么工作人员，首先是毛泽东思想的宣传员，是执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的战斗员。下去的干部，不论是管思想政治工作的，还是管生产业务工作的，都要抓根本，把学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，按照统一步骤、统一计划，将所有的工作都抓起来。
    这些措施订出以后，公社革委会负责人首先带头执行。革委会主任分工蹲点的大队距离公社不到二百米，也把行李搬到贫下中农家里，同贫下中农实行“五同”，没有紧要事不回公社。其他副主任、常委，有事回公社，不论多晚，能回大队就回大队。公社干部意气风发，干劲十足，许多过去在公社办的事，现在就地就办了，减少了层次，大大提高了工作效率。在广大贫下中农和革命干部共同努力下，这个公社的毛泽东思想学习班更加广泛地开办起来，革命大联合、革命三结合更加巩固和发展，革命大批判正在深入持久地开展，轰轰烈烈的春耕生产高潮也已经掀起。
