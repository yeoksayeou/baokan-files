The Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee is vigorously addressing the issue of rural grassroots leadership. Before the busy spring plowing season, over 95% of the communes and production brigades in the county have established and strengthened their leadership teams. Revolutionary cadres, filled with political enthusiasm, are working with poor and lower-middle peasants to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, swiftly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and striving to make a strong start in this year's spring plowing production.

In the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of rural grassroots cadres in Xingguo County have undergone significant tempering, their ideological awareness has been further raised, and they have become even more closely connected with the masses. However, some cadres who have made mistakes have, due to criticism from the masses in this great movement, developed varying degrees of resistance. In some places, grassroots cadres have the idea of shirking responsibilities, causing the local commune and brigade leadership teams to fall into a state of weakness and ineffectiveness for a time.

Chairman Mao teaches: "Once the political line is established, cadres become the decisive factor." After the establishment of the Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee, it was keenly felt that to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the rural grassroots level and to ensure a good spring plowing production this year, it is necessary to swiftly address the ideological issues of rural grassroots cadres and to establish and strengthen leadership teams at all levels.

To address this issue, the Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, inviting cadres and the masses to participate. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres," firmly believing that the rural grassroots cadres nurtured under the revolutionary traditions of the old revolutionary base areas love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. As long as methods of class education and revolutionary tradition education are used, those cadres who temporarily have resistance can be inspired to put down their burdens and take on heavy responsibilities. Therefore, the study classes in various places first invited old cadres to speak about the history of revolutionary struggles in the Soviet area, organized the masses and cadres to visit the Longgang Brigade, where Chairman Mao personally conducted investigations, to learn from Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice and the glorious deeds of revolutionary forerunners, to arouse the proletarian feelings of cadres and the masses, to firmly establish loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to firmly establish the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and being selfless.

The forty cadres from the twelve production teams of Longkou Brigade in Longkou Commune listened to the revolutionary forerunners' selfless deeds of bringing their own meals to work and working at night with lanterns and were deeply moved. They all expressed that they would definitely learn from the glorious examples of revolutionary forerunners and always follow Chairman Mao in making revolution. Zhou Peizhen, a cadre from Wulong Brigade in Shufu Commune, had fluctuating emotions and developed the idea of stepping down when he was impacted by the mass movement. After receiving class education and revolutionary tradition education, he voluntarily checked himself, saying: "I wanted to shirk responsibilities, mainly because I wrongly thought that there were many opinions from the masses and the work was difficult to do. This time, participating in the study class made me realize that I have not yet established the thought of 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people." After returning from the study class, the poor and lower-middle peasants continued to elect him as a brigade cadre. He happily took on the responsibility and, moreover, always put politics in command, and his work was done better than before.

While addressing the ideological issues of cadres, the Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee also paid attention to educating the masses to correctly treat cadres. They took "Criticize Revisionism, Combat Selfishness" as the guiding principle, leading the masses to follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "not only looking at a cadre's temporary actions but also looking at the cadre's entire history and work," to comprehensively evaluate the achievements and mistakes of revolutionary cadres, and to recognize that the majority of cadres are their class brothers. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants actively and enthusiastically helped cadres to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, helped cadres to correct their shortcomings and mistakes, removed the fear, and stood up to make revolution.

The establishment of what kind of rural grassroots leadership team is a matter of who holds power in the rural grassroots. The Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee, in addressing the issue of grassroots leadership teams, firmly implemented the Party's class line in the countryside, relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants from the beginning to the end to implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy. The county held representative conferences of poor and lower-middle peasants at various levels, conducted class analysis of cadres in their own communes and brigades, carefully reviewed them, proposed lists, and then took the lists to the masses for discussion, democratic election, and finally approved by the higher-level leadership organs. Longgang Commune, in the process of establishing leadership teams at all levels, did in-depth and detailed ideological work, and the masses fully discussed. Therefore, after the establishment of the leadership team, it won the trust and support of the masses; cadres dared to take responsibility, and production and work were rapidly developed. The newly elected leadership team of Hongshan Brigade in Gaojiang Commune, through the discussion of the representative conference of poor and lower-middle peasants, democratically produced a new management committee, with nine out of the original eleven members re-elected, and two new forces were added. The broad masses reflected: The newly elected leadership team has its roots firmly planted, and the leadership power is truly in the hands of us poor and lower-middle peasants. With them in charge, we are very reassured. The elected cadres also expressed: The poor and lower-middle peasants trust us, and we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take on the two heavy responsibilities of revolution and production, wholeheartedly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, and be lifelong servants of the people.

Now, the rural grassroots leadership teams in Xingguo County are leading the masses of the whole county to grasp revolution and promote production, launching a spring plowing production upsurge. Many commune and brigade cadres are actively working with the masses to implement production plans and increase production measures, striving for an all-around bumper harvest this year.

### 兴国县革命委员会领导社队大办毛泽东思想学习班　加强农村基层领导班子搞好春耕生产

　　兴国县革命委员会领导社队大办毛泽东思想学习班
　　加强农村基层领导班子搞好春耕生产
    本报讯　江西兴国县革命委员会，大力解决农村基层领导班子的问题。春耕大忙之前，全县百分之九十五以上的公社和大队，已经建立和健全了领导班子。广大革命干部怀着饱满的政治热情，和贫下中农一起大办毛泽东思想学习班，雷厉风行地落实毛主席的最新指示，力争打响今年春耕生产第一炮。
    兴国县广大农村基层干部在近两年的无产阶级文化大革命中，受到了很大锻炼，思想觉悟进一步提高，更加密切了同群众的联系。但是，有一些犯过错误的干部，由于在这场群众运动的大风大浪中受到了群众的批判，产生了不同程度的抵触情绪。有些地方的基层干部有撂挑子思想，使当地社队的领导班子一度陷于软弱无力的状态。
    毛主席教导说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”兴国县革命委员会成立以后，突出地感到：要把毛主席的最新指示落实到农村基层中去，搞好今年的春耕生产，必须迅速解决农村基层干部的思想问题，建立和健全各级领导班子。
    为了解决这个问题，兴国县革命委员会大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，吸收干部和群众一起参加。他们遵照毛主席关于“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，坚信在老苏区革命传统抚育下成长的农村基层干部，是热爱毛主席和共产党的，只要采用阶级教育和革命传统教育的方法，就能启发那些一时有抵触情绪的干部，放下包袱，站出来挑重担。因此，各地学习班，首先请老干部讲苏区革命斗争史，组织群众和干部到当年毛主席亲自作过调查的长冈大队参观，学习毛主席的伟大革命实践，学习革命前辈的光辉事迹，激发干部和群众的无产阶级感情，大树对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的无限忠心，大树“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的、一心为公的思想。龙口公社龙口大队十二个生产队的四十名干部，学习了毛主席最新指示，听了老苏区干部自带饭菜去办公、夜里打着灯笼去工作的大公无私的事迹，极为感动。他们纷纷表示：一定要坚决学习革命前辈的光辉榜样，永远紧跟毛主席闹革命。社富公社五龙大队干部周培珍，在受到群众运动的冲击时，情绪波动，一度产生了退坡思想。经过阶级教育和革命传统教育以后，他主动检查说：“我想撂挑子，主要是错误地认为群众意见多，工作不好做。这次参加学习班，使我认识到自己还没有树立‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务的思想。”从学习班回去以后，贫下中农继续选他当大队干部。他愉快地挑起担子，而且处处突出政治，工作比以前做得更好了。
    在解决干部思想问题的同时，兴国县革命委员会注意教育群众正确地对待干部。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，引导群众遵照毛主席“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”的教导，全面衡量革命干部的成绩和过失，认识干部大多数是自己的阶级兄弟。广大贫下中农在学习班中积极热情地帮助干部活学活用毛主席著作，帮助干部改正缺点错误，去掉怕字，站出来革命。
    建立什么样的农村基层领导班子，是关系到农村基层政权掌握在谁手里的问题。兴国县革命委员会在解决基层领导班子问题的时候，坚决贯彻执行党在农村中的阶级路线，自始至终依靠贫下中农执行毛主席的干部政策。全县分别召开了各级贫下中农代表大会，对本社本队的干部进行阶级分析，认真审查，提出名单，然后把名单拿到群众中去酝酿，民主选举，最后经上一级的领导机构审查批准。长冈公社在建立各级领导班子的过程中，思想工作做得深入细致，群众酝酿充分。因此，领导班子建立后，得到群众的信任和支持；干部大胆负责，生产、工作迅速开展。高举公社蒙山大队通过贫下中农代表大会讨论，民主产生了新的管委会，原来十一个委员中有九个连任，还增选了两名新生力量。广大群众纷纷反映：新选出的领导班子，根子扎得正，领导权真正掌握在我们贫下中农手里。有他们来当家，我们很放心。当选的干部也表示：贫下中农信任我们，我们一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，挑起革命、生产两副重担，全心全意为贫下中农服务，做一辈子人民的勤务员。
    现在，兴国县农村各级领导班子，正在带领全县群众狠抓革命，猛促生产，掀起了春耕生产高潮。许多社、队干部积极和群众一起落实生产计划和增产措施，为夺取今年农业全面丰收而努力。
