The 15th enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front sent a letter to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on March 2, expressing the determination of the people and soldiers of North Vietnam to join hands with their southern compatriots, resolutely respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms, fear no sacrifice, press on to victory, and concentrate all efforts to defeat the American aggressors.

The letter said: Under the banner of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the people and soldiers of South Vietnam have launched continuous attacks, widely risen up to strike at the enemy, and achieved unprecedented and enormous victories. The revolution in the South is entering a new high tide, pushing the U.S.-puppet clique to the brink of irretrievable failure, and opening up a very favorable new situation for the seizure of greater victories.

The letter said: The American aggressors and the traitorous clique of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky are making desperate struggles before their doom, committing more crimes against the South and the North.

However, their desperate struggles only make the entire Vietnamese people and soldiers more hateful of them, more closely united, and more determined to annihilate them.

The letter said: Concentrating all efforts to defeat the American aggressors is an unprecedented and extremely great task for the Vietnamese nation.

At this historic moment, the people and soldiers of North Vietnam are determined to further promote the patriotic emulation movement, overfulfill all production, combat, and work tasks. No matter how difficult and arduous, the 17 million people of the North are determined to make every sacrifice, provide the most abundant and timely support to the front, and together with the 14 million people of the South, press on to victory, and fulfill the extremely great mission entrusted by the country and history.

The 15th enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a statement on March 2, strongly condemning the recent savage massacres of the people of South Vietnamese cities by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The statement said: Since the New Year, under the continuous and fierce attacks of the people and soldiers of South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism and the traitorous clique of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky have suffered unprecedented defeats. They are struggling like a dying beast, savagely committing more and more heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people.

The statement said: The 15th enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front fully agrees with and resolutely supports the statements issued by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on February 15 and February 25, respectively, strongly denouncing to domestic and international public opinion the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors and the traitorous clique of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky against the people of South Vietnamese cities, and sternly warning them: The Vietnamese people will definitely demand this blood debt!

The statement said: The desperate struggles of U.S. imperialism and the traitorous clique of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky further expose their extremely desperate, helpless, and doomed situation. The Vietnamese people will turn hatred into strength, further enhance unity, press on to victory, launch continuous attacks, and continuously win victories.

The statement called on all peoples of the world to stop the bloody crimes of the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys against the people of South Vietnamese cities, and to provide more resolute and powerful support in all aspects to the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

    信中说：美国强盗和阮文绍—阮高其越奸集团在灭亡之前还要进行疯狂的挣扎，对南方和北方犯下更多的罪行。
    但是，它们绝望的挣扎只能使越南全国军民更加仇恨它们，更加紧密地团结起来，坚决地消灭它们。
    信中说：集中全力战胜美国侵略强盗，这是越南民族的空前和无比伟大的任务。
    在这个历史时刻里，越南北方军民决心进一步促进爱国竞赛高潮，超额完成一切生产、战斗和工作任务。不管如何艰难困苦，一千七百万北方同胞决心不惜一切牺牲，最充分和最及时地支援大前线，同一千四百万南方同胞一起，乘胜前进，完成祖国和历史交给的无比伟大的使命。

    声明说：新春以来，在越南南方军民连续不断和猛烈的进攻下，美帝国主义和阮文绍—阮高其越奸集团遭到了空前的惨败。它们正象一头垂死的野兽一样进行挣扎，疯狂地对越南人民犯下更多、更野蛮的新罪行。
    声明说：越南祖国战线中央委员会第十五次会议（扩大），完全赞成和坚决支持越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南民主共和国政府二月十五日和二月二十五日分别发表的声明，向国内外舆论强烈控诉美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其卖国集团对南方城市人民犯下的滔天罪行，并且严厉警告它们：越南人民坚决向它们讨还这一笔血债！
    声明说：美帝国主义和阮文绍—阮高其走狗集团的疯狂挣扎，更加暴露了它们的无比困窘、一筹莫展和走向彻底失败的处境。越南人民将化仇恨为力量，更加增强团结，乘胜前进，连续进攻，连续夺取胜利。
    声明呼吁全世界人民制止美国侵略者及其走狗对南方城市人民的血腥罪行，并且在各个方面给越南人民的抗美救国斗争以更加坚决和有力的支持。
