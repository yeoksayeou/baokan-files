The 6810 Unit of the People's Liberation Army, in its support-left work, has followed the spirit of Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions to pass on the army's experience of emphasizing proletarian politics and adhering to the "Four Firsts" to the revolutionary committee of the Gan Nan Paper Mill. They have enthusiastically helped them build a three-in-one leadership organ from a political and ideological standpoint.

Passing on the Army's Revolutionary Experience to the New Leadership Team, Making the Revolutionary Committee a Strong Command Center with Proletarian Party Spirit

Since the establishment of the Gan Nan Paper Mill Revolutionary Committee, most members have followed Chairman Mao's instructions, establishing a firm belief in wielding power for the proletariat. However, at the beginning, some members had incorrect thoughts. Some thought, "Now that the revolutionary committee is established, we can relax a bit"; some leading cadres thought that the days of "shelling and burning" were over, and now it was time to become the driving force of the revolution, neglecting ideological transformation; some worker members felt the burden was too heavy and were not willing to work in the revolutionary committee; there were also instances of disunity among some members, and so on.

How to help them overcome these incorrect thoughts? This was a new task facing the supporting-left People's Liberation Army. The comrades of the 6810 Unit studied Chairman Mao's March 7th instructions on "establishing a three-in-one leadership organ," combined with the army's experience in ideological and political work, and realized that this three-in-one leadership organ must be ideologically revolutionary and must arm the members of the revolutionary committee with Mao Zedong Thought.

The supporting-left group, following Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on "how to view Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought," first focused on the members' attitude towards Chairman Mao. They organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class with worker representatives, starting from class education, comparing the bitterness of the old society with the sweetness of the new society, thus helping the new leaders firmly establish an unshakable belief in Chairman Mao. On this basis, the supporting-left group and the new leaders together, in connection with their own thoughts and work practices, studied Chairman Mao's five conditions for proletarian revolutionary successors and Vice Chairman Lin's three standards, studying, comparing, and examining them sentence by sentence and word by word, making them deeply realize that proletarian power must be in the hands of proletarian revolutionaries who are loyal to Chairman Mao in order to be wielded well and firmly. Loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the soul of proletarian revolutionary successors, the greatest driving force for breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and the highest criterion for thoroughly eliminating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and enhancing proletarian party spirit in the new leadership team. Everyone agreed that only by permeating the five golden characters "loyal to Chairman Mao" through all aspects of the new leadership team's work, study, and life, can the revolutionary committee become a strong command center with proletarian party spirit. For this purpose, they launched the "Three Highs" and "Five Leads" activities in the new leadership team. "Three Highs" refers to: high ideological realm; high work attitude; high comrade spirit; "Five Leads" refers to: leading in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles"; leading in propagating Mao Zedong Thought; leading in exposing and criticizing private thoughts; leading in actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought; leading in correcting shortcomings and errors.

The supporting-left soldiers brought the army's revolutionary experience into the revolutionary committee, raising the ideological revolutionization of the committee members to a new height. The broad revolutionary masses saw this and were delighted, saying: "Our proletarian power is in the hands of such a leadership team, and we are at ease."

Passing on the Army's Experience of Grasping the Essentials to the Revolutionary Committee, Making the New Leadership Team the Locomotive for Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions

The ideological awareness of the new leadership team has been raised, and their work enthusiasm has been greatly mobilized. Some members moved their bedding into the office to handle work at any time, and some members did not rest on Sundays for work. However, the supporting-left group found that some comrades focused more on trivial matters and less on fundamental issues. After discovering this situation, the supporting-left group immediately organized the new leadership members to study Chairman Mao's statements on emphasizing politics, in connection with the practice of China's revolutionary victory, making them deeply realize that China's revolution has today's victory because of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone said, Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our proletarian revolutionaries. Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be nothing for the proletarian revolutionaries. Work is important, but studying Mao Zedong Thought is the most important. It is the fundamental of fundamentals.

On this basis, the supporting-left group guided everyone to study Chairman Mao's great teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," making all members remember it firmly and understand it deeply. No matter what work is done, politics must be emphasized first. According to the army's experience, the main leaders of the revolutionary committee all used 100% of their energy to grasp the fundamentals, to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to grasp ideological revolutionization. Not long ago, the province, due to the need to print pocket-sized editions of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," proposed a task for the factory to produce 700 to 1,000 tons of offset paper. This factory only had one machine that could produce this type of paper. This machine was previously used to produce typewriter paper, and if calculated based on producing offset paper, the economic profit would decrease. Previously, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party in the factory called this machine the workers' iron rice bowl. Now that the new leadership team is in power, how should they deal with this issue? They said: "'The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.' Profit-seeking is not our proletarian class's iron rice bowl, but the capitalist's iron rice bowl. Mao Zedong Thought is our proletarian class's lifeline. We produce paper for printing the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' letting Mao Zedong Thought quickly grasp the hearts of millions of revolutionary people, is our most glorious task." The revolutionary committee's decision to produce offset paper made all the revolutionary masses in the factory receive a vivid education, and the broad revolutionary masses loved and were loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought even more.

Under the help of the supporting-left People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary committee of this factory learned many valuable experiences of grasping the fundamentals from the army. Now, they first arrange work to arrange the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, first report work to report the situation of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, first inspect work to inspect the effect of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and first summarize work to summarize the experience of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They put the thorough implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, item by item, layer by layer, in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. They also turned all large and small meetings into lectures on implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao said in the March 7th instructions: "As long as we seriously do it, the problem is not difficult to solve." The members of the revolutionary committee deeply felt that: as long as the ideological and political work is done well, other work can be done well. Thousands of tasks, as long as politics is emphasized, the fundamentals are grasped, and everything can be solved. Walking the path of emphasizing politics and seriously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the fundamental of fundamentals, the key of keys. Only this matter is done, the new leadership team can become the locomotive for implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Passing on the Army's Methods of Ideological and Political Work to the Revolutionary Committee, Making the New Leadership Team the Core of Uniting the Masses

How to lead all the revolutionary masses in the factory to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions? Under the help of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary committee put forward the battle call to the entire factory: "Propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions without delay, hear Chairman Mao's voice and act swiftly, and act decisively." Every time Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, the new leaders immediately lead the way to the workshops and dormitories, knocking on doors to convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and personally lead revolutionary workers to drum and shout on the streets to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

To make Chairman Mao's latest instructions take root in the hearts of the broad masses of workers, the supporting-left People's Liberation Army passed on the army's whole set of methods for meticulous political and ideological work to the revolutionary committee. At the end of last year, the supporting-left group, using the factory's 20 days of machine maintenance time, worked with the revolutionary committee members to hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the factory. In the study classes, they established Mao Zedong's personally advocated theoretical style of Marxism-Leninism, which combines theory with practice, and through the method of "pairing up and layering," helped the new leadership team learn to grasp living thoughts, lecture on Chairman Mao's latest instructions according to the problems, hold lectures on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and carry out "one helps one, one pairs with one" and other activities.

Every time the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions encounters ideological resistance, the supporting-left group would bring the responsible comrades of the revolutionary committee to the masses to talk heart-to-heart and resolve knots. The head of a mass organization in the logistics office had simple work methods in the past and did not know how to mobilize and propagate the masses; there was factionalism among the leading cadres, causing splits, and so on. The supporting-left group and the revolutionary committee members went to this place for a work point, talked heart-to-heart with them, helped them understand Chairman Mao's teachings on "fighting private interests and criticizing revisionism," and made them eliminate their misunderstandings and unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Because the responsible comrades took the lead in fighting private interests, overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and carrying out "one helps one, one pairs with one" activities, they led the masses to carry out "one helps one, one pairs with one" and mass heart-to-heart talks, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance from the ideological level and promoting the revolutionary great criticism.

This factory also widely carried out the activity of "when there is a matter, first implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions," and the masses had problems and learned the latest instructions, learning one latest instruction and solving one problem. There emerged a new atmosphere where people spoke according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, acted according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and unified everyone's thoughts with Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The comrades of the supporting-left People's Liberation Army in this factory, through words and deeds, consciously passed on the army's good experience, good traditions, and good methods of emphasizing politics to the revolutionary committee, making this new leadership team always, everywhere, and in everything pay attention to thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and doing good ideological and political work, thus winning the praise of all the revolutionary masses in the factory. Everyone reflected: The members of the revolutionary committee conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions to our hearts in a timely manner. Such a leadership team, we support it a thousand times, we support it ten thousand times!

　　把解放军的革命好作风传给革命委员会
　　六八一○部队用毛泽东思想武装赣南造纸厂革委会成员，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，狠抓思想革命化，使革委会成为具有无产阶级党性的坚强指挥部
    本报讯　六八一○部队在支左工作中，遵照毛主席的“三·七”指示的精神，把部队突出无产阶级政治、坚持四个第一的经验，传给了赣南造纸厂的革命委员会，热情帮助他们从政治思想上建设三结合领导机关。
    把部队革命化的经验传给新领导班子，使革命委员会成为具有无产阶级党性的坚强指挥部
    赣南造纸厂革命委员会成立以来，大多数委员都能按照毛主席指示办事，树立为无产阶级掌好权、用好权的坚强信念。但革委会成立之初，在部分成员中也曾产生过一些不正确的想法，有的人认为，“革命委员会成立了，可以松口气了”；个别领导干部认为，“炮打、火烧”的日子过去了，现在是当革命动力的时候了，忽视了思想改造；工人中的委员有的感到担子太重，不安心在革命委员会里工作；在个别委员中还有不团结的现象，等等。
    怎样帮助他们克服这些不正确的思想？这是摆在支左解放军面前的一项新的任务。六八一○部队的同志学习了毛主席的“三·七”指示中关于“建立三结合领导机关”的教导，结合部队做思想政治工作的经验，认识到这个三结合领导机关必须是思想革命化的，必须用毛泽东思想把革命委员会成员的头脑武装起来。
    支左小组遵照林副主席“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题”的指示，首先狠抓革委会成员对毛主席的态度问题。他们和新领导成员一起举办了有工人代表参加的毛泽东思想学习班，从阶级教育入手，通过忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，从而使新领导成员牢固地树立起对毛主席无限忠诚的坚强信念。在这个基础上，支左小组又和新领导成员一道，联系自己的思想和工作实际，学习毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件以及林副主席提出的三条标准，逐条逐句逐字地学习、对照、检查，使他们深刻地认识到无产阶级的政权，只有掌握在无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命派手里，才能掌得好，掌得牢。忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是无产阶级革命事业接班人的灵魂，是破私立公的最大动力，是在新领导班子里彻底扫除资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性的最高准则。大家一致认为，只有把“忠于毛主席”这五个金光闪闪的大字贯穿于新领导班子的工作、学习、生活的一切方面，才能使革委会成为具有无产阶级党性的坚强指挥部。为此，他们在新领导班子里开展“三高”“五带头”活动。“三高”即：思想高境界；工作高姿态；对同志高风格；“五带头”即：带头学习毛主席最新指示和“老五篇”；带头宣传毛泽东思想；带头亮私、斗私；带头活学活用毛泽东思想；带头改正缺点错误。
    支左的解放军把部队革命化的经验带到革命委员会里来，使革委会成员的思想革命化提到一个新的高度。广大革命群众看在眼里，乐在心里，他们说：“咱们的无产阶级大权，掌握在这样的领导班子手里，就放心了。”
    把部队抓根本的经验传给革命委员会，使新领导班子成为落实毛主席最新指示的火车头
    新领导班子的思想认识提高了，工作积极性就大大调动起来了。有的委员把铺盖搬进了办公室随时处理工作，有的委员为了工作，星期天也不休息。但是在他们辛勤的工作中，支左小组发现一些同志抓事务多、抓枝节问题多，抓根本、抓大问题少。发现这种情况后，支左小组马上组织新领导成员带着问题学习毛主席关于突出政治的论述，联系中国革命胜利的实践，使他们深刻地认识到，中国革命所以有今天的胜利，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。大家说，毛泽东思想是我们无产阶级革命派的命根子。没有毛泽东思想就没有无产阶级革命派的一切。工作千重要万重要，抓毛泽东思想学习最重要，千根本，万根本，毛泽东思想是根本的根本。
    在这个基础上，支左小组又引导大家学习毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”这个伟大教导，使全体成员记得特别牢靠，领会特别深刻。不管抓什么工作，都把突出政治放在第一位。根据解放军的经验，革命委员会的主要负责人，都用百分之百的精力抓根本，抓对毛主席最新指示的全面落实，抓思想革命化。不久以前，省里因为要印制袖珍本《毛主席语录》，给该厂提出了一项生产七百吨到一千吨凸版纸的任务。这个厂只有一台机器能生产这种纸。这台机器，以前是生产打字纸的，按生产凸版纸来计算经济利润，收入的利润就会减少。以前，厂里党内一小撮走资派把这台机器说成是工人的铁饭碗。现在新领导班子掌权，怎么对待这个问题呢？他们说：“‘大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。’利润挂帅不是我们工人阶级的铁饭碗，是资本家的铁饭碗，毛泽东思想才是我们工人阶级的命根子。我们生产印制《毛主席语录》用纸，让毛泽东思想迅速掌握千千万万革命人民，是我们最光荣的任务。”革命委员会决定生产凸版纸这件事，使全厂革命群众受到了一次最生动的教育，广大革命群众更加热爱、更加忠于伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想。
    在支左解放军的帮助下，这个厂的革命委员会学习了解放军抓根本的许多宝贵经验。现在，他们布置工作首先布置学习毛主席的最新指示，汇报工作首先汇报执行毛主席最新指示的情况，检查工作首先检查贯彻毛主席最新指示的效果，总结工作首先总结落实毛主席最新指示的经验。他们把狠抓毛主席最新指示的全面落实，条条落实，层层落实放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的位置上。他们还把一切大小会议都变成落实毛主席最新指示的讲用会。毛主席在“三·七”指示中说：“只要认真去做，问题并不难解决”。革命委员会的成员深深体会到：只要认真把思想政治工作做好了，其他工作就能做好。千头万绪的工作，只要抓住了突出政治，也就抓住了根本，一切工作就迎刃而解了。走突出政治的道路，认真抓落实毛主席的最新指示，这是根本的根本，关键的关键。只有这件事做了，新的领导班子才能成为落实毛主席最新指示的火车头。
    把部队做思想政治工作的一套方法传给革命委员会，使新领导班子成为团结群众的核心
    怎样带领全厂革命群众全面落实毛主席的最新指示？革命委员会在解放军的帮助下，向全厂提出“宣传毛主席的最新指示不过夜，听到毛主席的声音闻风而动，雷厉风行”的战斗号召。每当毛主席的最新指示一传来，新领导成员就立即带头到车间、宿舍，挨门串户地传达毛主席的最新指示，还亲自带领革命职工敲锣打鼓走上街头宣传毛主席的最新指示。
    为了把毛主席的最新指示扎根在广大职工的心坎上，支左解放军又把部队做艰苦细致的政治思想工作的一整套方法传给革命委员会。去年年底，支左小组利用厂里维修机器的二十天时间，和革命委员会成员一起在全厂大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，在学习班里，树立毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，通过“对口抓，层层传”的方法，帮助新领导班子学会抓活思想，针对问题宣讲毛主席的最新指示，召开学习毛主席最新指示的讲用会，开展“一帮一，一对红”等活动。
    每当落实毛主席的最新指示遇到思想阻力时，支左小组就带着革委会的负责同志一起到群众中去谈心，解疙瘩。后勤办公室一个群众组织的负责人过去工作方法简单，不会去发动群众，宣传群众；领导骨干中闹派性，搞分裂，等等。支左小组和革命委员会的成员就到这里蹲点，同他们谈心，帮助他们理解毛主席“要斗私，批修”的教导，使他们消除了隔阂，在毛泽东思想基础上团结起来。由于负责人带头斗私，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，开展“一帮一，一对红”活动，就带动了群众开展“一帮一，一对红”以及群众性的谈心活动，从思想上巩固了革命大联合，推动了革命大批判。
    这个厂还广泛开展了“一事当前，先落实毛主席最新指示”的活动，群众有了问题就学最新指示，学习一条最新指示就解决一个问题。出现了说话按毛主席最新指示讲，行动按毛主席最新指示做，每个人的思想都用毛主席的最新指示来统一的新气象。
    在这个厂支左的解放军同志，通过言传身带自觉地把部队突出政治的一套好经验，好传统，好方法，传给革委会，使这个新领导班子处处、时时、事事注意狠抓落实毛主席最新指示，做好思想政治工作，从而得到了全厂革命群众的赞扬。大家反映：革命委员会的成员，把毛主席的最新指示及时传到我们的心坎里，这样的领导班子，我们一千个拥护，一万个支持！
