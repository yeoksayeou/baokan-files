Editor's Note: Our great leader Chairman Mao attaches great importance to mobilizing women to participate in production and political activities and to fully utilize women's significant role in the revolution and production. As Chairman Mao teaches us: "The day when all women rise up is the day when the Chinese revolution achieves victory."

For a long time, there has been a sharp struggle between two lines in the women's movement. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the broad masses of working women have actively participated in the struggle for the proletariat to seize and consolidate political power, resolutely taking the socialist path, and in this struggle, striving for their own liberation. Meanwhile, the Chinese Khrushchev, using the bourgeois "women's point of view" and "welfare point of view," has concealed the class struggle essence of the women's movement, opposed women's revolution, and opposed women taking the socialist path. The Chinese Khrushchev attempted to make the broad masses of women detach themselves from the current political struggle, deviate from the socialist direction, tie women to the small circle of the family, revolve around the "self," and achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary women, together with the revolutionary masses across the country, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, launching a high tide of criticism against the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The articles selected by our newspaper today expose and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the women's movement. The authors, through their personal experiences, illustrate that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the women's movement, and the revolutionary path indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao is the only path to women's liberation.

Revolutionary women across the country should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and strive for new achievements in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always shown great concern for the broad masses of working women. At every critical juncture of the revolution, he has pointed out the direction for us to advance. When the socialist high tide arose in China's rural areas, Chairman Mao instructed us: "To build a great socialist society, it is of great significance to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in production activities. ... True equality between men and women can only be achieved in the process of the socialist transformation of the entire society." What was particularly inspiring was that in 1955, Chairman Mao personally wrote a comment for the article "The Plan of the Xingtai County Democratic Women's Federation on Women's Work in the Development of Agricultural Cooperativization." Chairman Mao said: "To mobilize all female labor to participate in the labor front on the principle of equal pay for equal work, this requirement should be realized in the shortest possible time." This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest encouragement, greatest trust, and greatest hope for us. The women of Xingtai, like women across the country, under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participated in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. In the three great revolutionary movements, we fought against nature, against the land, against the enemy, and against the "self." We broke free from the shackles of feudal patriarchy, repelled the invasion of capitalist ideology, and won economic and political positions. Women, like men, participated in collective labor and managed state affairs, playing the role of "half of the sky" in the great socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The Chinese Khrushchev saw that the broad masses of women were following Chairman Mao on the revolutionary path, and he was terrified and enraged. The Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle. Before liberation, he never talked about politics, claiming that "the central task of women's work is production," and that the purpose of production was for "family prosperity." In 1957, he put forward the so-called fundamental policy of the women's movement, emphasizing the importance of managing the household. In 1960, he promoted the "three autonomies and one contract" black goods, spreading the wind of individual farming. At that time, he also instructed his subordinates to shout everywhere: "Women should mainly engage in household sideline production." The master gives the order, and the servant carries it out. The Chinese Khrushchev's agents in our area did everything they could to obstruct women from participating in political struggle and production activities. They said things like: "When women are in charge, trees do not grow; when women lead, meals are a worry." When I became the branch secretary, they tried every means to suppress me, saying things like "girls will eventually get married," trying to bind me with family ties. I did not fall for the Chinese Khrushchev's tricks and resolutely followed the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents always talked about "home," trying to confine women to small families, making women revolve around the stove, mill, children, pigs, chickens, and ducks, not caring about politics or power, and letting the exploiting classes dominate their thoughts, walking the capitalist path of personal enrichment. Their evil intentions were to restore capitalism in China. If their reactionary plots were to succeed, we working women would suffer twice and endure double hardships.

In the old society, we working women suffered class oppression and swallowed bitter tears. It was our great savior Chairman Mao who rescued us from the deepest layer of the "dark pit"; it was Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that guided us women onto the broad socialist path; it was the boundless Mao Zedong Thought that gave us the right to be masters of our own fate, achieved our complete liberation, and brought us happiness. A thousand liberations, ten thousand liberations, only by arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought can we achieve complete liberation; a thousand happinesses, ten thousand happinesses, only by following Chairman Mao on the socialist path can we achieve the greatest happiness.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution." To achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, take "criticizing the self and opposing revisionism" as the key, organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and also organize family study classes, mobilizing the broad masses of women to expose, criticize, and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the women's movement, thoroughly eliminating its poisonous influence. Only by learning and mastering Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful weapon, and thoroughly criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the women's movement, can we women achieve complete liberation and better contribute to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

### 坚决走毛主席指引的革命路

专栏：

    编者按　我们伟大的领袖毛主席十分重视发动妇女参加生产和政治活动，十分重视发挥妇女在革命和生产中的重大作用。正如毛主席教导我们的：“全国妇女起来之日，就是中国革命胜利之时。”
    长期以来，在妇女运动中，一直进行着两条路线的尖锐斗争。广大劳动妇女在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，积极投入无产阶级夺取政权、巩固政权的斗争，坚决走社会主义道路，并在这个斗争中争取自身的解放。而中国赫鲁晓夫则用资产阶级的“妇女观点”、“福利观点”，掩盖妇女运动的阶级斗争实质，不准妇女革命，反对妇女走社会主义道路。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图使广大妇女离开当前的政治斗争，背离社会主义方向，把妇女拴在家庭的小圈子里，围绕“私”字打转转，以达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命妇女和全国革命群众一道，活学活用毛主席著作，掀起了批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的高潮。本报今天选登的几篇文章，对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义妇女运动路线进行了揭露和批判。作者以亲身体会说明，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是妇女运动的指导思想，伟大领袖毛主席指引的革命道路是妇女解放的唯一道路。
    广大革命妇女要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，办好毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。

    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，对广大劳动妇女非常关怀。他在每个革命的转变关头，都给我们指出前进的方向。当社会主义高潮在中国农村兴起的时候，毛主席指示我们：“为了建设伟大的社会主义社会，发动广大的妇女群众参加生产活动，具有极大的意义。……真正的男女平等，只有在整个社会的社会主义改造过程中才能实现。”特别激动人心的是，一九五五年，毛主席还亲自为《邢台县民主妇女联合会关于发展农业合作化运动中妇女工作的规划》一文写了按语。毛主席说：“使全部妇女劳动力，在同工同酬的原则下，一律参加到劳动战线上去，这个要求，应当在尽可能短的时间内，予以实现。”这是毛主席对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大信任，最大希望。我们邢台的妇女跟全国的妇女一样，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，积极投入阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验。在三大革命运动中，我们与天斗，与地斗，与敌人斗，与“私”字斗。我们斗垮了封建宗法的束缚，打退了资本主义思想的侵袭，争得了经济地位和政治地位。妇女跟男子一样参加集体劳动，管理国家大事，在伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，发挥了“半边天”的作用。
    中国赫鲁晓夫看到广大妇女群众紧跟毛主席走革命路，怕得要死，恨得要命。中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大学说。解放前，他根本不谈政治，胡说什么“妇女工作的中心任务也是生产”，生产的目的是为“家庭的丰衣足食”。一九五七年，他抛出所谓妇女运动的根本方针，大谈什么专心持家。一九六○年，他抛出“三自一包”的黑货，大刮单干风。这时，他又指使他的干将到处叫嚷：“妇女主要是搞家庭副业。”主子下令，奴才照办。中国赫鲁晓夫在我们这儿的代理人，极力阻挠妇女参加政治斗争和生产活动。他们胡说什么：“女人当家，林木不发；女人领头，吃饭上愁。”我当了支部书记，他们想方设法打击我，胡说什么“闺女早晚得成家”，想用家庭束缚我。我不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，坚决走毛主席指引的革命路。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人，张口一个“家”字，闭口一个“家”字。他们就是想把妇女圈在小家庭里，使妇女变成围着锅台转、磨台转、孩子转、猪羊鸡鸭转，不问政治，不问政权，思想上让剥削阶级来统治，一心走个人发家致富的资本主义道路。他们的恶毒用心，就是要在中国复辟资本主义。如果让他们的反动阴谋得逞，我们劳动妇女就要受二遍苦，遭二茬罪。
    在旧社会，我们劳动妇女吃尽了阶级苦，咽饱了血泪仇。是我们的大救星毛主席，把我们从“黑咕?咚的枯井”的最底层解救出来；是毛主席的革命路线，引导我们妇女走上了社会主义康庄大道；是光焰无际的毛泽东思想，给了我们当家作主的权利，使我们获得了彻底解放，得到了幸福。千解放，万解放，用毛泽东思想武装头脑才能获得彻底解放；千幸福，万幸福，紧跟毛主席走社会主义道路才是最大的幸福。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”为了夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，我们一定要更高地举起革命的批判旗帜，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，并且要办好家庭学习班，发动广大妇女群众，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义妇女运动路线，展开大揭发、大批判、大斗争，彻底肃清它的流毒。只有学习和掌握毛泽东思想这个强大的武器，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义妇女运动路线，我们妇女才能获得彻底解放，才能更好地为中国革命和世界革命贡献力量。
