Members of revolutionary leadership teams will encounter many problems in their actual work. For example, how should one correctly handle criticism and opinions from the masses? In work, should one be a people's servant who dares to take the lead, or a "peacemaker" who is afraid to take the lead? When encountering difficulties, should one avoid them or go to the most difficult places as Chairman Mao instructed? Ultimately, all these problems boil down to how to continue the revolution and how to constantly make new contributions to the people.

Cadres from some production brigades in the Cangzhou region have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly recognized and solved many new problems they faced, raised their consciousness, and promoted their work. Their experiences are worth reading.

The People's Masses Have Been Fully Mobilized, Making Work Easier

Wang Chongli, Party Branch Secretary of Zhaoguan Village, Chengguan Commune, Nanpi County:

I have been part of a "three-in-one" leadership team for over half a year. Reflecting on when I first stepped forward, I was always afraid of this and that, and dared not work boldly. Why? Because I had not truly understood Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "believe in and rely on the masses." I was afraid of making mistakes and being criticized by the masses. In reality, this was because I did not believe in the masses and underestimated their consciousness. Chairman Mao taught us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." We must regard our attitude towards the masses as our attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must believe what Chairman Mao believes and rely on what he relies on. Only in this way can we correctly handle ourselves and the masses, and boldly work with open arms.

My understanding of this has gradually deepened.

In September last year, the two factions in the village had united organizationally, but their thoughts had not yet fully united. Soon, Chairman Mao's latest instruction to hold extensive study classes was issued, and our "three-in-one" leadership team decided to hold a study class for both factions to consolidate the revolutionary great alliance. However, when the leadership members divided their tasks, they all thought that focusing on production was easier, while holding study classes was more troublesome. I also thought: Can both factions hold a study class together? If I get involved, what if I say something wrong? Will the faction that originally did not support me reorganize and attack me? Just as I was at a loss, Chairman Mao's teachings reminded me: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing." Yes, Chairman Mao wants us to hold study classes, so we must resolutely carry it out. We took the initiative to hold a study class for both factions, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary great alliance together, exposing our selfish thoughts, fighting factionalism, and listening to old poor peasants recalling bitter experiences and mutual care among poor and lower-middle peasants under the old society. In this way, the revolutionary masses of both factions said that there is no fundamental conflict of interest among us poor peasants. The cadres took the lead in holding study classes, and they did it right. Thus, the revolutionary masses of both factions further consolidated the revolutionary great alliance in their thoughts.

Facts have educated me. The important sign of the current good situation in the countryside, as pointed out by Chairman Mao, is that "the people have been fully mobilized." The poor and lower-middle peasants have greatly raised their consciousness. After the Cultural Revolution, rural work is not more difficult but easier. I think that in the "three-in-one" leadership team, not daring to work boldly is not because the masses do not believe in oneself, but because oneself does not believe in the masses. Loyalty to Chairman Mao means believing in the masses, and believing in the masses means daring to work boldly. This is my experience of working for over half a year.

The Masses Supervising Cadres with Mao Zedong Thought Is a Good Thing

Zhang Shuyuan, Brigade Leader of Dayezhuang, Nanchen Village Commune, Cangzhou City:

Now, some cadres complain about the masses raising more opinions and criticisms. This problem should be solved ideologically.

Indeed, the masses raise more opinions and criticisms now. This shows that after the Cultural Revolution, the broad masses care more about state affairs and socialist causes, and also care more about cadres; it shows that the masses' consciousness has been raised higher, they grasp Mao Zedong Thought more, see problems more sharply, and have higher and stricter requirements for cadres. This is a good thing, an important aspect of the good situation of the Cultural Revolution. Recognizing this, there is no complaint. If one treats the masses' daring to criticize and raise opinions with personalism or officialdom, one will have resentment. In the new situation, cadres should better integrate with the masses, humbly listen to the masses' opinions, and advance with the masses.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The masses are the real heroes," only by closely relying on the people and accepting the masses' criticisms and supervision can work be done well. Once, the villager Wang Jirui came to my home and asked me how my recent work was going. I said, "I have paid more attention to politics and have overcome some subjectivism." I did not mention what problems there were in my work. He said, "That's good," and then criticized me: "In your work, you still lack 'one punch, one hole,' 'one step, one footprint.'" He then gave examples of cadres' problems. He spoke, and I thought about the cadres' problems, realizing that I had not grasped them tightly enough. Although I had done some work, it was not solved well, and the cadres who should have stepped forward had not. I thought about how the poor and lower-middle peasants follow Chairman Mao closely and see far, feeling even more that listening to the masses' opinions is very important. Based on the masses' opinions, we held another short-term study class with village representatives and two branch secretaries participating, specifically to help the cadres. This made the two cadres quickly step forward and participate in the brigade leadership team. It can be seen that the masses raising more opinions and criticisms is a good thing!

As Long as It Conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, One Must Dare to Speak and Manage

Liu Shushan, Brigade Leader of Qianjiaoshangcun, Guan Zhuang Commune, Qing County:

Cadres are servants of the people. Servants of the people must uphold truth for the people's interests, speak when they should, and manage when they should. They cannot be indifferent and act as "peacemakers."

The masses dislike "peacemakers" the most. I have a deep understanding of this. When the masses criticized and helped me, I mistakenly thought that the masses had many opinions about me because I liked to manage things and managed too much, too seriously. I also mistakenly thought that if I managed less and was not so serious, I would not get so many opinions, and it would be better to be a "good person." Until I was elected into the brigade leadership team, this thought had not been well resolved. Sometimes in work, I would go along with the crowd and not dare to boldly put forward my opinions. Later, the masses found this active thought in me and saw similar thoughts in other cadres, and sharply pointed out: If cadres do not come up with an idea, how can they lead the villagers forward! I heard the villagers' opinions and knew that the villagers do not like "peacemakers," they like those who dare to speak and act, dare to work boldly, and dare to uphold truth. I also thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "As long as we uphold what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our team will definitely prosper." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings and the masses' wishes, I made up my mind: For the revolution, for the people's interests, I will speak when I should and manage when I should, and I will not be a "peacemaker."

This year, our brigade planted wheat. Originally, each production team arranged the wheat fields in the river bend, planning to use electric irrigation with river water, but because of the delay in buying electric wire for over a month, if we waited any longer, we would miss the wheat planting season. If we did not wait for the electric wire, the river bend fields could not be irrigated with wells. At this time, I thought of changing the wheat fields to the place where there were originally wells. But then I thought: Each team had already arranged the wheat fields, if I proposed a new plan, would someone say I was giving blind orders and get a lot of opinions. This thought came to mind, and I immediately thought that this was considering personal interests, which was wrong. How to plant the wheat in time is a big deal. So I put forward the idea of "moving" the wheat fields, letting the cadres and villagers discuss it. The cadres and villagers discussed while learning the self-reliant spirit of Dazhai, unified their thoughts, and together repaired the old wells and prepared the land, planting the wheat in time. The villagers all said my idea was right and well-managed. From this incident, I deeply felt that: As long as it conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, conforms to revolutionary and people's interests, one should speak more and manage more.

There is also an important point here. Daring to speak and manage for the revolution and managing less is a big issue of two lines of thought and struggle. Chairman Mao taught us: "Work is struggle." This means that there is struggle in work, and there must be struggle in work. Only by upholding truth and struggling in work can one conform to Chairman Mao's teachings and conform to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Being a "peacemaker," speaking less, and managing less, wanting to be a "good person" among the masses, not only will one not become a "good person," but one will also lose one's stance and direction on major issues.

Dare to Shoulder Heavy Burdens and Make New Contributions for the Revolution

Zhang Shuchen, Party Branch Secretary of Xinan Village, Shisu Commune, Suining County:

As a cadre, one often encounters difficulties. My experience is that as long as one is loyal to Chairman Mao, one dares to take the lead in shouldering heavy burdens, dares to take the first responsibility, and dares to be the first to take the lead.

In February last year, I participated in the "three-in-one" leadership team, and everyone elected me as the first-in-command. I had not been out for long when I encountered a difficult situation. Our brigade had a bumper harvest of wheat last year, and some people said: "This year's wheat harvest, we must keep an eye on it, and reduce the quota a bit, so that everyone can get about 200 jin." This talk reached the cadres' ears, and they all said this idea was wrong, but they were still afraid of this and that, and dared not take the lead in doing the work. I also had mixed feelings, especially thinking about the Cultural Revolution, where someone pasted a big-character poster on me, saying that I used to want to hand in more grain, curry favor with superiors, make a name, and twist my elbow outward. Thinking of this, my mind was filled with the struggle between "public" and "private." Should I go out and do the work with my head held high? What if some individuals do not understand it for the time being? Should I keep my head down and not do the work? How can I face Chairman Mao? At this time, it was as if Chairman Mao was by my side encouraging me: "Difficult work is like a burden, placed in front of us, see if we dare to undertake it." My mind suddenly became clear. The heavy burden of serving the people, who else will undertake it if not us? Loyalty to Chairman Mao is the top priority, who else will take the lead if not us? If one is not responsible for the work, picks the light and avoids the heavy, pushes the heavy burden to others, and picks the light for oneself, that is disloyalty to Chairman Mao.

Loyalty is shown in action. I first went to the second team, where I had received the most opinions and this time also demanded less procurement grain, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Then, I organized all the village cadres and villagers to severely criticize the fallacies of "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," "material incentives," etc., by the Chinese Khrushchev, and seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on subordinating partial interests to overall interests. I also took the lead in exposing my selfish thoughts and checking my thoughts of being insufficiently loyal to Chairman Mao at the meeting. In this way, the cadres and villagers, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, straightened out the relationship between the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and completed the summer procurement task for the whole year in the summer, and also completed the autumn procurement task in excess.

After the incident, I realized that loyalty to Chairman Mao means that one must take the lead in doing the most difficult things, "the more difficult the place, the more one must go," and the heavier the burden, the more one must shoulder it. In the future, I will dare to take the lead in the leadership team for the revolution, shoulder heavy burdens for the people, truly work with open arms for the revolution, and make new contributions to give Chairman Mao face.

    “忠”字在胸　“敢”字当头
    ——河北沧州地区部分生产大队干部畅谈在新领导班子里抓革命促生产的体会
    参加革命领导班子的干部，在实际工作中会遇到许多问题。例如，如何正确地对待群众的批评和意见？在工作中，是作“敢”字当头的人民勤务员，还是作“怕”字当头的“和事佬”？遇到“遭难”的事，是绕开道走，还是按着毛主席教导的“越是困难的地方越是要去”？所有这些问题，归根结底还是一个如何继续革命、如何不断为人民立新功的问题。
    沧州地区部分生产大队干部，遵照毛主席的教导，正确地认识和解决了面临的许多新问题，提高了觉悟，推动了工作，他们的体会值得大家一读。　——编者
    人民群众充分发动起来了，工作就好做了
    南皮县城关公社翟官屯大队党支部书记王崇礼：
    我参加“三结合”领导班子已经半年多了。回想自己刚站出来的时候，总是怕这怕那，不敢大胆工作。为什么呢？就是因为思想上还没有真正领会毛主席“要相信和依靠群众”的最新指示。怕自己说错了，群众揪住小辫子不放。实际上是不相信群众，把群众的觉悟估计得太低了。毛主席教导我们说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”我们必须把对待群众的态度，看成是对待毛主席革命路线的态度，要做到：毛主席相信我相信，毛主席依靠我依靠。只有这样，才能正确对待自己，正确对待群众，伸开手脚大胆地工作。
    我这个认识也是一步一步提高的。
    去年九月份，村里的两派群众组织从组织上联合了，可是思想上还没有完全联合起来。不久，毛主席关于大办学习班的最新指示下达了，我们“三结合”领导班子就想办一个两派都参加的学习班，以巩固革命大联合。但是领导成员研究分工的时候，都认为抓生产省心，办学习班费劲。我心里也在想：两派合着办学习班，能办到一块来吗？要是自己一插手，万一说错一句话，原来不支持自己的一派会不会重新拉起队伍来冲击自己呢？正在我没有主心骨的时候，毛主席他老人家的教导提醒了我：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”对，毛主席让咱办学习班，咱就要坚决照办。我们就主动办起了两派都参加的学习班，和大伙一块学习毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示，一块亮私心、斗派性，一块听老贫农忆苦和忆旧社会贫下中农互相关心的事迹。这样，两派革命群众都说，在咱们贫下中农内部也没有根本的利害冲突，天下穷人是一家，干部们带头办学习班，办对了。就这样，两派革命群众从思想上进一步巩固了革命大联合。
    事实教育了我，当前农村形势大好的重要标志，正象毛主席他老人家指出的，“是人民群众充分发动起来了”。贫下中农觉悟大大提高了，无产阶级文化大革命以后的农村工作不是更难做了，而是更好做了。我认为，在“三结合”领导班子里，不敢大胆工作，不是群众不相信自己，而是自己不相信群众。忠于毛主席就能相信群众，相信群众就能大胆工作。这就是我站出来工作半年多的体会。
    群众用毛泽东思想监督干部是大好事
    沧州市南陈屯公社大和庄大队长张书元：
    现在有的干部对社员爱提意见、爱提批评，有一种埋怨情绪。这个问题应从思想上解决。
    现在确实社员提意见多了，提批评多了。这说明广大群众经过无产阶级文化大革命，更关心国家大事，更关心社会主义事业了，也更关心干部了；说明人民群众觉悟提得更高了，毛泽东思想掌握得多了，看问题尖锐了，对干部要求也更高更严了。这是大好事，这是无产阶级文化大革命大好形势的一个重要方面。认识了这一点，就没有情绪。如果带着个人主义或者官气来对待群众的敢于批评、爱提意见，就有反感。在新的形势下，干部应当更好地深入群众，虚心听取群众意见，和群众一起前进。
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”，只有紧紧依靠人民群众，接受群众的批评和监督，工作才能做好。有一次，社员王继瑞找到我家，问我这段工作做得怎么样。我说：“注意抓政治了，主观主义也有了克服。”自己没有谈出工作中还有什么问题。他听后说了声“这点很好”，然后就对我提出了批评：“你在工作中还缺‘一个拳头砸一个坑’，‘一步一个脚印’。”接着他就举例说了干部问题。他这么一说，我想到在干部问题上就是抓得不紧，自己虽然做了些工作，但解决得还不好，应该站出来的干部还没站出来。我想到贫下中农跟毛主席跟得紧，看得远，更感到听取群众意见很重要。根据群众的意见，我们又开办了一个有社员代表和两个支部书记参加的短期学习班，专门帮助干部，使这两个干部很快站出来，参加了大队领导班子。可见群众多提意见，多提批评，就是好！
    只要符合毛泽东思想就要敢说敢管
    青县官庄公社前阁上营大队长刘树山：
    干部是人民的勤务员，人民的勤务员就得为人民利益坚持真理，应当说的就得说，应当管的就得管，不能得过且过，当“和事佬”。
    群众最不喜欢“和事佬”，这一点我有深刻的体会。在群众批评帮助我的时候，我曾错误地认为群众对我意见多，是因为自己爱管事、管事多，太认真了。我还错误地认为，要是少管点事，别那么太认真，就不至于落这么多意见，还是当“好好先生”好。直到我被选入大队领导班子以后，这种思想也没很好地得到解决。工作中有时随声附和，不敢大胆提出自己的意见。后来群众发现我这个活思想和见到别的干部也有类似的思想问题，就尖锐地提出：当干部的要是不拿出个主意来，怎么领着社员前进哪！我听到社员这种意见，知道了社员并不喜欢和稀泥的老好人，他们喜欢的是敢说敢做、敢大胆工作、敢坚持真理的人。我又想到毛主席的教导：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”根据毛主席的教导和群众的心愿，我下了决心：为革命，为人民利益，该说的就说，该管的就管，决不当“和事佬”。
    今年我们大队种大麦，原来各生产队把种大麦的地安排在河套里，想搞电灌引用河水种麦，可是因为买电线一直等了一个多月，如果再等下去就要误了种大麦。不等电线吧，河套地又不能打井，这时我就想到把大麦改在原来有井的地方去种。可是又一想：原来各队把大麦地都安排好了，再提出新方案来，是不是有人说我瞎指挥，落得一堆意见。这个思想一露头，自己马上想到这是从个人考虑，是不对的，怎么能够及时把大麦种上是大事。所以我就把大麦地“搬家”的意见提出来，让干部和社员讨论。干部和社员一面讨论，一面学习了大寨自力更生的精神，统一了思想，大家齐心修复旧井，整好了地，及时把大麦种上了。社员们都说我这个意见对，管得好。从这件事上我深刻体会到：只要符合毛泽东思想的，符合革命利益、人民利益的，就多说、多管。
    这里边还有重要的一点，为革命敢说敢管和少说少管，这是两种思想、两条路线斗争的大问题。毛主席教导我们说：“工作就是斗争”。这就是说，是工作就有斗争，只要工作就得斗争，只有在工作中坚持真理，坚持斗争，才符合毛主席的教导，才符合毛主席的革命路线。当“和事佬”，少说话，少管事，想以这个在群众中落“好人”，不光落不出“好人”来，还会在大是大非问题上丧失立场，迷失方向。
    为革命敢挑重担立新功
    肃宁县师素公社西南庄大队党支部书记张书臣：
    当干部常有这种事，碰上一个难题，看你敢不敢出头？我的体会是，只要一心忠于毛主席，就敢挑第一副重担子，敢负第一份大责任，敢当第一个打头人。
    去年二月份，我参加了“三结合”领导班子，大伙又推选我当了第一把手。我站出来时间不长，就碰上了一件“遭难”的事。我们大队去年小麦大丰收，有的人说：“今年麦子收下来，咱可得把着点，顶着少交点，每人准得分一头二百斤的。”这话传到干部耳朵里，都说这种想法不对头，可就是怕这怕那，不敢出头去做工作。我心里也是七上八下的，特别是想到文化大革命当中，有人给自己贴大字报，说我过去净想多交点粮食，向上级讨好，出出名，胳膊肘子往外扭。想到这，我的脑子里“公”字和“私”字就打开了架，抬着头去做工作吧，个别人一时不理解怎么办？闷着头不去做工作吧，那怎么对得起毛主席呢？这时候，就象毛主席他老人家在身旁鼓励我说：“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。”我一下子心里亮了，为人民服务的重担子，咱不承担谁承担？忠于毛主席是头等大事，咱不出头谁出头？要是对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的，那就是对毛主席的不忠。
    忠不忠，看行动。我首先到原来给自己提意见最多、这次又要求少交征购粮的二队去宣传毛泽东思想，接着，组织全村的干部和社员狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”等等谬论，认真学习了毛主席有关局部利益服从整体利益的教导。我还在会上带头亮私斗私，检查了自己忠于毛主席不够的思想表现。就这样，干部和社员按照毛主席的教导，摆正了国家、集体和个人利益三者之间的关系，去年夏征一季就完成了全年的任务，秋征又超额完成任务。
    事情过后我认识到，忠于毛主席，就得越是难出头的事越是要出头去干，“越是困难的地方越是要去”，越是重担子越是要挑。今后我要在领导班子里，为革命敢出头，为人民挑重担，真正做到伸开手脚干革命，晃开膀子立新功，给毛主席他老人家争气。
