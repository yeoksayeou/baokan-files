The General Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army issued a report on February 5, stating that the Lao patriotic army and people, continuing the momentum of the great victory at Nam Bao, have, with the wholehearted support of the people, actively and continuously struck the enemy, inflicting heavy losses.

According to incomplete statistics, the Lao patriotic army and people conducted 89 large and small battles during this period, annihilating and demoralizing over 1,200 enemy troops, shooting down and destroying 11 enemy aircraft, sinking 4 motorboats, destroying 4 military vehicles, seizing over 190 pieces of various weapons (including 9 cannons of different calibers), and destroying two ammunition depots.

KANGO, March 9 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, wrote a letter on March 7 to Lao women on the occasion of International Women's Day, warmly praising the significant contributions made by Lao women to the Lao people's struggle against American imperialism and for national salvation. He called on them to overcome all difficulties and achieve greater victories. The letter pointed out that the military and people of the entire country have responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, waging a very brave struggle to defeat American imperialism and its lackeys, achieving great victories. Lao women have made significant contributions to the struggle against American imperialism and for national salvation.

The letter pointed out that Lao women not only actively work and produce, supporting and assisting the military, serving the front lines, but also join the militia and guerrilla forces, taking up arms to fight the enemy and defend their homeland.

After praising the heroic deeds and shining examples of Lao women on various fronts of the struggle against American imperialism and for national salvation, the letter emphasized that the current situation is very favorable for the Lao people. Greater victories lie ahead. However, many difficulties still need to be overcome. American imperialism and its lackeys are preparing to expand the war, attempting to reverse their defeats in Laos and South Vietnam. Lao women and all ethnic groups in the country must further strengthen their unity, resolutely fight, and determine to defeat American imperialism and its lackeys, achieving greater victories.
