Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians have launched wide-ranging attacks and bravely advanced, annihilating large numbers of enemy forces and capturing many enemy strongholds.

Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut, March 15 — According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, in recent days, from the northern to the southern regions of Laos, patriotic soldiers and civilians have launched wide-ranging attacks and bravely advanced against the enemy, annihilating large numbers of enemy forces and capturing many enemy strongholds.

In the northern region, in February, the patriotic soldiers and civilians of Luang Namtha Province bravely attacked the enemy, forcing the right-wing military to retreat from Xieng Sen, Meng Mang, and La Ling. In the pursuit and annihilation of the enemy, the patriotic armed forces killed 31 enemy soldiers and captured 15 who surrendered.

In Phongsaly Province, at the end of February, the patriotic soldiers and civilians recaptured the Ong Phia, Nong Det, and Dong Ha regions from the enemy.

In early March, under the attack of local armed forces and guerrillas in Sam Neua Province, the right-wing military, which is supported by the Americans, was forced to abandon the strongholds of Phou Koun, Phi Pan, Xong Dien, and Phamay.

On March 2, the local armed forces and guerrillas of this province surrounded the Phou Koun enemy stronghold, killing and wounding 11 enemy soldiers. The bandits guarding this stronghold were forced to retreat to the Phi Pan stronghold, and later, under the continued attack of the patriotic armed forces, they abandoned this stronghold and fled in disarray. On March 4, the enemy sent troops to attempt to retake this position but was again defeated, with 18 enemy soldiers killed and many wounded.

In the southern region, from February 16 to 28, the local armed forces and guerrillas of Udomsai Province intercepted the American-supported "special forces" that came to the Anou Dong Sane-Etat region of this province to carry out harassment activities. Preliminary statistics indicate that at least 40 bandits were killed or wounded. During the battle, the patriotic soldiers and civilians seized 27 weapons and released 250 innocent civilians who had been detained by the enemy.

At the end of February, the local armed forces and guerrillas of Attapeu Province repelled the enemy's multiple "sweeps," annihilating more than 100 enemy soldiers and seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition.

On February 16, the patriotic soldiers and civilians of Savannakhet Province, in a counterattack against invading American air pirates, shot down one American aircraft. (Accompanying photo)

    新华社康开十五日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝爱国军民最近以来从上寮到下寮广泛出击，勇猛进攻敌人，消灭了敌人大批有生力量，攻占了许多敌军据点。
    在上寮地区，琅南塔省爱国军民二月份勇猛进攻敌人，迫使右派军队退出先仙、孟芒和拉灵等地。爱国武装力量在追歼敌人的战斗中，歼灭敌军三十一名，还有十五名投降。

    三月初，在桑怒省地方武装力量和游击队的攻击下，美国豢养的右派军队被迫放弃富贡、菲潘、宗天和法苗等据点。
    三月二日，这个省的地方武装力量和游击队包围了富贡敌人据点，打死打伤敌军十一名。驻守在该据点的匪徒，被迫退到菲潘据点，后来在爱国武装的继续进攻下又丢弃这个据点，狼狈逃窜。三月四日，敌人派军队企图重新夺回这个阵地，但又被打得惨败，被打死十八名，打伤许多名。
