During the period of our country's three years of economic difficulties, the Chinese Khrushchov, representing the interests of the landlords and the bourgeoisie, in line with the needs of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, stirred up a storm of individual farming in the countryside. He boldly ordered: "In industry, we must retreat sufficiently, and in agriculture, we must also retreat sufficiently, including the system of contracting production to households and individual farming." This storm of individual farming not only blew through agricultural production but also through sericulture production.

In our county, the agents of the Chinese Khrushchov, following the orders of their master, used the pretext of improving management and mobilizing the enthusiasm of sericulturists to push for the "downsizing of sericulture farms" and implement a whole set of revisionist management policies such as "low production quotas, high remuneration, generous rewards, and guaranteed distribution." The specific measures were to "hand over" the sericulture farms to individual sericulturists for management, to provide material incentives to the sericulturists, advocating for the lowest possible production quotas, the highest possible remuneration standards, and the largest possible rewards. Because the production quotas were set very low, sericulturists could "overfulfill" most of the time, and with high remuneration standards and various rewards, the "overfulfilled" part mostly ended up in the hands of individual sericulturists. Thus, the income of sericulturists was always far higher than that of ordinary farmers, sometimes even one, two, three, or four times higher. Due to the "guaranteed distribution" rule, even if there was a reduction in production, and not a single cocoon was harvested, the sericulturists could still get 80 to 90 percent of the originally agreed remuneration. After implementing these measures, the landlords and rich peasants were delighted, saying: "Sericulture production is about to retreat sufficiently, and there is hope for agriculture. In the future, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries should all retreat to this state!" Those wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist thoughts also vied to raise silkworms, using every means to exploit the collective's loopholes to enrich themselves.

Oak tussah silkworm production is a major specialty of our county. In production brigades with many sericulture farms like ours, a large number of spring and autumn silkworms are raised every year. Therefore, doing well in sericulture production not only brings a large income to the collective but also plays a significant role in supporting national construction. After the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents pushed the "downsizing of sericulture farms" and the "low production quotas, high remuneration, generous rewards, guaranteed distribution" set of revisionist goods, they made sericulture production chaotic, bringing extremely serious consequences. They "improved" capitalist management methods and "mobilized" individual production enthusiasm, striking at socialist collective production enthusiasm, destroying sericulture production, and undermining the collective economy. Specifically, there are four major harms: First, it caused a large gap in remuneration between agriculture and sericulture, affecting the unity among community members; second, it corrupted the thoughts of community members, making some sericulturists only think of their own interests and play tricks on the collective; third, individuals got rich, but the collective got less income, affecting the consolidation and development of the collective economy; fourth, the downsizing of sericulture farms destroyed the mountains and forests, only caring for the present and not for the future. In short, there are countless harms, and the most fundamental harm is that it led sericulture production down the capitalist road. The Chinese Khrushchov and his agents pushing this set of black goods in sericulture production is an attempt to undermine the socialist system in the countryside, destroy the people's communes, and sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is extremely reactionary.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only socialism can save China." We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, love socialism the most, care about the collective economy the most, and oppose individual farming the most. Therefore, as soon as this capitalist management method in sericulture production appeared, we poor and lower-middle peasants opposed it from the bottom of our hearts and used every means to resist this capitalist road. The Chinese Khrushchov and his agents pushed for the "downsizing of sericulture farms," and we insisted on unified management of sericulture farms and collective cultivation, providing favorable conditions for the future development of sericulture production. The Chinese Khrushchov and his agents pushed for "low production quotas, high remuneration, generous rewards, guaranteed distribution," and we tried our best to make the production quotas reasonable and the remuneration balanced, finding ways to narrow the remuneration gap between agriculture and sericulture. Over the years, we have been fighting against the "household contracting" and "individual farming" black winds stirred up by the Chinese Khrushchov in the countryside, making his plot to restore capitalism in the countryside unsuccessful.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Sericulture production must also adhere to political leadership, emphasizing proletarian politics everywhere, to adhere to the socialist road and develop healthily.

In the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, we must take up the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents. We must thoroughly smash this set of capitalist management methods in sericulture production, thoroughly eliminate all the poisons of the "household contracting," "material incentives," and other revisionist black goods advocated by the Chinese Khrushchov in the countryside, and uproot the roots of revisionism. We must take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self" as the key link, establish a set of socialist management systems with political leadership in the process of carrying out the struggle between the two roads, raise oak tussah silkworms with revolutionary spirit, increase collective income, provide more industrial raw materials for the country, further consolidate and develop the collective economy, and turn the sericulture farm into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 挖出蚕业生产上单干的总根子

    挖出蚕业生产上单干的总根子
    辽宁省宽甸县石湖沟公社亮子沟大队第五生产队队长　徐传久
    在我国三年经济暂时困难的时期，中国赫鲁晓夫代表地主、资产阶级的利益，适应帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的需要，在农村里刮起一股单干妖风。他悍然下令：“工业上要退够，农业上也要退够，包括包产到户，单干。”这股单干妖风不仅刮到了农业生产上，而且刮到了蚕业生产上。
    在我们县，中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人，秉承其主子的旨意，以改善经营管理，调动蚕民生产积极性为名，在柞蚕生产上大搞“蚕场下放”，推行“低包产、高报酬、厚奖励、保险分”等一整套修正主义经营路线。具体做法是，把蚕场“放”给蚕民个人管理，对蚕民大搞物质刺激，主张包产指标越低越好，报酬标准越高越好，奖励幅度越大越好。由于包产指标订得很低，蚕民在多数时候都可“超产”，加上报酬标准订得高，又有五花八门的奖励，“超产”部分就大部落入蚕民个人手里。这样，蚕民的收入总是远远地高于一般农民，有时甚至高出一、两倍到三、四倍。由于有了“保险分”的规定，个别时候减产了，即使一个茧不摘，蚕民还可得原订报酬的百分之八、九十的工分。实行了这些办法之后，地主、富农拍手叫好，说：“蚕业生产快要退够了，农业上也有希望了，将来农、林、牧、副、渔都退到这样才好呢！”那些资本主义思想严重的富裕中农，也削尖了脑袋争着放蚕，千方百计地钻集体的空子，借以发家致富。
    柞蚕生产是我们县的一大特产，象我们这样蚕场较多的山区生产队，每年都要放很多春蚕和秋蚕。因此，搞好蚕业生产不仅是集体的一大笔收入，而且对支援国家建设也有很大作用。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，推行了“蚕场下放”，“低包产、高报酬、厚奖励、保险分”这一套修正主义黑货之后，把蚕业生产搞得乌烟瘴气，带来了极其严重的恶果。它“改进”的是资本主义经营方法，“调动”的是个体生产积极性，打击了社会主义集体生产积极性，破坏了蚕业生产，瓦解了集体经济。具体说来，有四大危害：一、造成农、蚕报酬差距过大，影响了社员之间的团结；二、腐蚀了社员思想，使有些蚕民净打自己的小算盘，同集体耍心眼；三、个人发了家，集体少得收入，影响了集体经济的巩固和发展；四、蚕场下放，毁坏了山林，只顾眼前，不顾长远。总之，千条害处，万条害处，最根本的一条害处就是把蚕业生产引上了资本主义道路。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在蚕业生产上推行这一套黑货，就是妄图在农村瓦解社会主义制度，破坏人民公社，搞垮无产阶级专政，真是反动透顶。
    毛主席教导我们：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，最爱社会主义，最关心集体经济，最反对单干。所以，蚕业生产上的这种资本主义经营方式一露头，我们贫下中农都从心眼里反对，千方百计抵制这条资本主义道路。中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人大搞“蚕场下放”，我们就坚持蚕场统一管理，集体培育，为以后蚕业生产的发展提供了有利条件。中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人推行“低包产、高报酬、厚奖励、保险分”，我们就尽量把产量订得合理一些，把报酬搞得平衡一些，想办法缩小农、蚕之间的报酬差距。几年来，我们就是这样和中国赫鲁晓夫刮起的“包产到户”、“单干”的黑风进行针锋相对的斗争，使他在农村复辟资本主义的阴谋没有得逞。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”蚕业生产也必须坚持政治挂帅，处处突出无产阶级政治，才能坚持社会主义道路，才能健康地向前发展。
    在农村两条道路的斗争中，我们要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人。我们要彻底砸碎蚕业生产上这一套资本主义经营管理方式，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“包产到户”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货在农村的一切流毒，拔掉修正主义的根子。我们要以“斗私，批修”为纲，在开展两条道路斗争的过程中，建立一套政治挂帅的社会主义经营管理制度，用革命的精神放好柞蚕，增加集体收入，为国家提供更多的工业原料，进一步巩固和发展集体经济，把蚕场办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
