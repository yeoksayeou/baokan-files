In the midst of the busy spring ploughing season, how should study classes of Mao Zedong Thought be run? Several cadres from a few production brigades in Du Village Commune, Linchang County, Hebei, held a discussion on this issue.

The leading cadre of Tulou Village Brigade, Wang Haishen, said: We should run field-side study classes. He said: With the arrival of the busy spring ploughing season, there are many farm tasks, and labor is dispersed. It is no longer suitable to run study classes as in winter. The brigade leadership, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "consult with the masses on every matter," studied with the poor and lower-middle peasants and decided to run field-side study classes. With many farm tasks, we should run classes according to the farm tasks. This way, both personnel and time are guaranteed. During rest times, we study, and when called, everyone is ready. We can study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and farm tasks are done well and quickly.

The militia platoon leader of Sanjiaotang Village Brigade, Yang Jian'an, said: We should run family study classes. He said: During the busy spring ploughing season, days are long and nights are short, and farm tasks are heavy. Our brigade runs Mao Zedong Thought study classes for one or two families. Cadres at all levels take the lead, starting from their own families, gaining experience, and promoting it to the whole village. The brigade leader Yang Jinguang, with a family of five, started a family Mao Zedong Thought study class. Using time before and after meals, they study Chairman Mao's works, criticize and repudiate revisionism, and the whole family, including those working in the fields and those at home, can participate in the study without affecting production. The whole brigade of 246 households started 184 study classes, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The militia instructor of Songcun Village Brigade, Guo Herong, said: Study classes should be focused and solve key problems. He said: At the beginning of the busy spring ploughing season in our Songcun Village Brigade, study classes were temporarily suspended. The reason was that production was busy and time was short, and we wanted to solve all big and small problems, resulting in none of the problems being solved. Later, we studied and decided that study classes should be focused and solve key problems. In our brigade, there were three production team cadres who wanted to quit. The brigade cadres helped these three teams run study classes, focusing on the main problems of these cadres, especially the idea of "suffering losses" as cadres. Through studying the "Three Articles," comparing with White Seekers, Zhang Side, and Old Foolish Mountain Mover, we solved the cadres' ideological problems. The three teams' cadres all bravely took up the double burdens of revolution and production.

Our brigade's grain yield is low. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, cadres and commune members showed boundless enthusiasm, determined to transform the sandbank and turn low yield into high yield. However, some cadres and commune members had a sense of difficulty. The study class focused on this problem, organizing everyone to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The cadres and commune members' enthusiasm rose. The task originally planned to be completed in 25 days was finished in just 8 days. Running study classes this way, commune members are more interested in learning, and the study classes are run better and better.

    适应春耕大忙特点办好学习班
    河北临漳县杜村集公社几个大队干部举行座谈
    在春耕生产大忙中，怎样办好毛泽东思想学习班？河北临漳县杜村集公社几个大队的干部就这个问题进行了座谈。
    土楼庄大队领导成员王海申说：要办好田头学习班。他说：春耕大忙到来，农活多，劳力分散，还象冬季那样办学习班就不适应了。大队领导班子遵照毛主席“遇事多和群众商量”的教导，同贫下中农一起研究，决定办田头学习班。农活多，按照农活项目去办。这样做，人员、时间都有保证，休息时学习，一叫人就齐，针对问题，能活学活用毛主席著作，农活搞得又好又快。
    三教堂大队民兵连长杨金安说：要办好家庭学习班。他说：春耕生产大忙季节，天长夜短，农活又繁重，我们大队就办一家一户、三家两户的毛泽东思想学习班。各级干部带头，先从自己家着手，摸出经验，推向全村。一队长杨金冈全家五口人，办起家庭毛泽东思想学习班，利用饭前饭后时间，学习毛主席著作，斗私批修，全家男女老少，下地的、在家的都能参加学习，不影响生产。全大队二百四十六户办起了一百八十四个学习班，斗私批修，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。
    宋村大队民兵指导员郭合荣说：学习班要中心突出，重点解决问题。他说：俺宋村大队春耕大忙一开始，学习班一度停办了。原因是生产忙，时间少，大小问题都想解决，结果哪个问题也解决不了。后来就研究，办学习班要中心突出，重点解决问题。俺们大队有三个生产队的干部想撂挑子。大队干部就帮助这三个队办好学习班，根据这些干部的主要问题，重点解决当干部“吃亏”思想。经过学习
  “老三篇”，对照白求恩、张思德、老愚公，解决了干部的思想问题，三个队的干部，都勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担。
    俺大队粮食产量低，无产阶级文化大革命中，干部、社员焕发出冲天干劲，决心改造沙滩，变低产为高产。但也有些干部、社员有畏难情绪。学习班针对这个问题，组织大家学习《愚公移山》，干部、社员的劲头都起来了。原计划二十五天完成的任务，仅用八天就完成了。这样办学习班，社员越学越有兴趣，学习班越办越好。
