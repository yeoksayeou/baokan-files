The China Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee today issued a statement vehemently denouncing the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in their frenzied massacre of the people of South Vietnam.

The statement said that recently, the heroic people of South Vietnam have fought the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs into a state of disarray. The U.S. imperialists and their running dogs have been using aircraft and artillery to indiscriminately bomb cities such as Saigon, Hue, and Da Nang, even resorting to the use of napalm, phosphorus shells, and poison gas to slaughter innocent civilians. The Chinese people are filled with indignation over this.

The statement fully endorses the statement issued by our government on March 1, firmly supporting the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in their recent denunciation of the brutal crimes committed by the U.S. puppet regime in its frenzied massacre of the people of South Vietnam. It reiterates the declaration by the 31 million Vietnamese people that they will persist in their war of resistance against the U.S. aggressors to the end.

The statement points out that the recent New Year victories of the South Vietnamese military and people mark the development of the Vietnamese people's war to a new height. The Vietnamese people, building on their successes, will continue to fight and are sure to achieve final victory. As our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "To hold out is to win. I am deeply convinced that the Vietnamese people, by persisting in a protracted people's war, will surely drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam."

The statement says that all aggressors are stubborn and will not give up until they see the coffin. The U.S. imperialists, this paper tiger, are still desperately struggling in their death throes. They are savagely bombing the civilian population of South Vietnam, and the Johnson administration is stepping up military mobilization, expanding the call-up of reserves, sending new cannon fodder to South Vietnam, intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam, and colluding with the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique to hatch various plots for negotiations. However, under the mighty blows of the people's war waged by the heroic Vietnamese people, the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, no matter how brutal and cunning their methods, are doomed to failure.

The statement concludes by saying that at present, the situation in the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. aggressors is excellent. The great struggle and brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people have won the admiration and support of the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world. The Chinese people resolutely support their Vietnamese brothers in carrying the war of resistance against the U.S. aggressors to the end and learning from the unyielding revolutionary fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people.

    中国人民坚决支持兄弟的越南人民打到底
    不管美帝如何残暴和狡猾都逃脱不了彻底失败的命运
    新华社五日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天发表声明，愤怒声讨美帝国主义及其走狗疯狂屠杀南越人民的滔天罪行。
    声明说，最近，被英雄的越南南方人民打得狼狈不堪的美帝国主义及其走狗，用飞机、大炮狂轰滥炸西贡、顺化、岘港等许多城市，甚至使用凝固汽油弹、磷质炮弹和毒气，屠杀广大无辜居民。中国人民对此感到无比愤慨。
    声明表示完全拥护我国政府三月一日发表的声明，坚决支持越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南民主共和国政府最近关于控诉美伪集团疯狂屠杀越南南方人民的野蛮罪行，重申三千一百万越南人民誓把抗美救国战争进行到底的声明。
    声明指出，越南南方军民的新春大捷，标志着越南人民战争已经发展到新的高度。越南人民再接再厉，坚持战斗，必能取得最后胜利。正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席所说：“坚持下去就是胜利。我深信，越南人民坚持持久战争，一定能够把美国侵略者从越南赶出去。”
    声明说，一切侵略者都是不见棺材不掉泪的。美帝国主义这只纸老虎还在拚命进行垂死挣扎，它对越南南方城市居民进行野蛮轰炸，约翰逊政府还正在加紧军事动员，扩大征召后备兵员，向越南南方增派新的炮灰，加紧轰炸越南北方，并勾结苏联现代修正主义领导集团策划种种和谈阴谋。但是，在英雄的越南人民进行的人民战争无比威力的打击下，美帝国主义及其走狗无论使用如何残暴和狡猾的手段，都是注定要失败的。
    声明最后说，目前，越南人民抗美救国战争的形势一片大好。越南人民的伟大斗争和辉煌胜利赢得了亚洲、非洲和全世界革命人民的钦佩和支持。中国人民坚决支持兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底，并学习越南人民不屈不挠的革命战斗精神。
