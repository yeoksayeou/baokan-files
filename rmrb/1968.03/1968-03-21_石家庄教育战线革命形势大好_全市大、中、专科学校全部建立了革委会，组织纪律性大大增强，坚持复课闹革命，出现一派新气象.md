The revolutionary situation in the educational sector of Shijiazhuang is excellent. All universities, middle schools, and specialized schools in the city have established revolutionary committees, organizational discipline has significantly improved, and the focus is on resuming classes and making revolution, presenting a new and vibrant scene.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, March 20th: Under the help of the People's Liberation Army, the broad revolutionary teachers and students in the educational sector of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, suppressed the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, swept away anarchism, and significantly enhanced the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of revolutionary teachers and students. This has powerfully promoted revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. By March 5th, all 72 universities, middle schools, and specialized schools in the city had established revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs—the revolutionary committees.

Currently, the revolutionary situation in the educational sector of Shijiazhuang is excellent. Broad revolutionary teachers and students have an even deeper love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They guide their words and deeds with Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary teachers and students not only strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works but also help neighborhoods and families establish many Mao Zedong Thought study classes, regarding the spread of Mao Zedong Thought as their most glorious task. Many schools have organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, using spare time to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions in nearby factories and rural areas. Revolutionary youngsters remember Chairman Mao's teachings, insist on resuming classes and making revolution, line up on time for morning exercises, study on time, voluntarily observe the school's various rules and disciplines, and strive to learn and deeply understand Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution. They thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev. Broad revolutionary teachers and students are determined to criticize and expose the bourgeois educational system, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of the school, and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution on the educational front to the end.

The broad revolutionary teachers and students of 72 universities, middle schools, and specialized schools in Shijiazhuang, in the proletarian cultural revolution, have high-held the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and have resolutely fought against a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, achieving great victories. Because of the victories, some people have developed a sense of pride and complacency; coupled with the influence of anarchist thoughts, some people attend classes and meetings, listening if they want to, leaving if they don't, and saying this is "self-education"; some people regard the rules and disciplines established by the school to ensure the resumption of classes and making revolution as "frames," and do not want to observe them; some even do not seriously implement the instructions issued by the proletarian headquarters. This situation obstructs the realization of revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and obstructs the smooth progress of resuming classes and making revolution.

The comrades of the People's Liberation Army conducting military training in various schools have seriously analyzed these situations and believe that anarchism and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism are a pair of "twins," both being reactionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie, corrosive agents to the revolutionary ranks, and protective umbrellas for class enemies. Therefore, the comrades of the People's Liberation Army stationed in various schools have vigorously helped revolutionary teachers and students establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, while focusing on class education, organizing students to visit revolutionary martyrs' cemeteries, factories, and rural areas to investigate poverty and hardship, inviting old workers, poor peasants, and model heroes to give reports on bitter memories and sweet thoughts, exposing the plots of class enemies to sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution, and raising class struggle and line struggle awareness, determined to overcome the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism.

On this basis, the comrades of the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary teachers and students together study Chairman Mao's teachings of the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" and "Strengthen discipline, revolution will be invincible," discussing "How to treat revolutionary organizational discipline?" The comrades of the People's Liberation Army use their personal experiences to explain the great significance of high revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline in defeating the enemy and achieving victory in revolutionary struggles. At the same time, they set an example, implementing the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army such as the "March 8th Spirit" in their actions, and if there are any shortcomings, they will actively conduct self-examinations according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

Through study, discussion, and learning from the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, broad revolutionary youngsters unanimously recognize that being free and easy, casual, and doing whatever they want is an expression of extreme individualism, which does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Individualism in a revolutionary collective organization is very harmful. It is a corrosive agent that causes disintegration of unity, loosening of relations, passivity in work, and divergence of opinions." If this individualism is not resisted and allowed to develop, it will lead to the wrong path. They point out that in the past, the "organizational discipline" advocated by the handful of capitalist roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev was to cultivate obedient tools for them and serve their restoration of capitalism. This bourgeois "organizational discipline" must be resolutely overthrown and thoroughly smashed. While the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, the series of systems and regulations to ensure the smooth progress of resuming classes and making revolution, must be voluntarily observed and never violated. Broad revolutionary youngsters declare that we are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. We will definitely implement all the instructions issued by the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao without any deviation; we will definitely voluntarily observe the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat and thoroughly do a good job in resuming classes and making revolution.

Currently, the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of broad revolutionary teachers and students have significantly improved. They insist on resuming classes and making revolution, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and rapidly promote revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Revolutionary committees have been established in various schools, and resuming classes and making revolution present an excellent situation.

    石家庄教育战线革命形势大好
    全市大、中、专科学校全部建立了革委会，组织纪律性大大增强，坚持复课闹革命，出现一派新气象
    据新华社石家庄二十日电　河北省石家庄教育战线广大革命师生在人民解放军的帮助下，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，横扫无政府主义，革命师生的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性大大加强，有力地促进了革命大联合和革命三结合。到三月五日，全市七十二所大学、中学、专科学校全部建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构——革命委员会。
    目前，石家庄市教育战线革命形势大好。广大革命师生对伟大领袖毛主席、战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更加热爱，更加忠诚，事事用毛泽东思想指导自己的言行。革命师生们不但自己努力活学活用毛主席著作，还帮助街道、家庭办起了许多毛泽东思想学习班，把传播毛泽东思想作为自己最光荣的任务。许多学校组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，利用课余时间到附近的工厂、农村宣传毛主席的最新指示。革命小将们牢记毛主席的教导，坚持复课闹革命，每天按时整队出操，按时学习，自觉地遵守学校的各项制度和纪律，努力学习和深刻领会毛主席的教育革命思想，深入地批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线。广大革命师生决心批倒批臭资产阶级教育制度，搞好学校的斗、批、改，把教育战线的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    石家庄市七十二所大、中、专科学校的广大革命师生，在无产阶级文化大革命中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对党内一小撮走资派进行了坚决的斗争，取得了伟大的胜利。因为胜利，一些人产生了骄傲自满情绪；加之受到无政府主义思想的影响，有的上课、开会，愿意听就听，不愿意听就走，还说这是“自己教育自己”；有的把学校为保证复课闹革命规定的制度、纪律看成是“框框”，不愿遵守；有的甚至对无产阶级司令部发出的指示也不认真贯彻执行。这种情况，阻碍着革命大联合和革命三结合的实现，阻碍着复课闹革命的顺利进行。
    在各学校进行军训的解放军同志认真地分析了这些情况，认为无政府主义和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是一对“双胞胎”，都是资产阶级的反动思潮，是对革命队伍的腐蚀剂，是阶级敌人的保护伞。于是，驻各学校的解放军同志，大力帮助革命师生开办毛泽东思想学习班，同时狠抓阶级教育，组织同学参观革命烈士陵园、工厂，到农村访贫问苦，请老工人、老贫农、英雄模范作忆苦思甜的报告，揭露阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋活动，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，决心克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义的影响。
    在这个基础上，解放军同志和革命师生一起学习毛主席提出的“三大纪律八项注意”和“加强纪律性，革命无不胜”的教导，讨论了“怎样对待革命的组织纪律？”解放军同志用亲身体会，讲述了在革命斗争中，高度的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，对消灭敌人，取得胜利的重大意义。同时，他们以身作则，把解放军的三八作风等优良传统贯彻在行动中，如果有了缺点，就按照毛主席的教导，主动地进行检查。
    经过学习、讨论和学习解放军的优良作风，广大革命小将一致认识到：自由散漫，随随便便，自己想怎么办就怎么办，是极端自由主义的表现，不符合毛泽东思想。毛主席教导我们：“革命的集体组织中的自由主义是十分有害的。它是一种腐蚀剂，使团结涣散，关系松懈，工作消极，意见分歧。”如果对这种自由主义不加抵制，任其发展，就会走到邪路上去。他们指出，过去，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派所鼓吹的“组织纪律”，是为他们培养驯服工具，为他们复辟资本主义服务的。对这种资产阶级的“组织纪律”，就是要坚决打倒，彻底砸烂。而对无产阶级的革命纪律，对保证复课闹革命顺利进行的一系列制度、规定，就要自觉遵守，决不违反。广大革命小将表示，我们是毛主席的红卫兵，对伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出的一切指示，一定要不折不扣地坚决执行；对无产阶级的革命纪律，一定要自觉遵守，彻底搞好复课闹革命。
    目前广大革命师生革命性、科学性和组织纪律性大大增强，他们坚持复课闹革命，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，迅速地促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，各个学校的革命委员会纷纷建立起来，复课闹革命出现一派大好形势。
