The Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Province recently convened representatives of revolutionary masses, the People's Liberation Army's support-left units, and revolutionary cadre representatives from all over the province to come to Jinan to jointly hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. These classes concentrated on eradicating the two major evils currently hindering the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions: bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism. These classes promoted the revolutionary study style of linking theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao and achieved good results. They quickly influenced all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations across the province, promoting the thought revolutionization of the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries. Currently, a revolutionary mass movement to seriously overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism is being widely and deeply carried out across Shandong Province. From the Luxi Plain to the Jiaodong Peninsula, from the Yimeng Mountain area to the Yellow Sea coast, the situation of revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination is better than ever before. According to statistics, out of the thirteen prefectures and cities in the province, eleven have achieved revolutionary unity from top to bottom. Ninety-seven percent of county-level administrative units have achieved revolutionary unity. Revolutionary committees at the prefecture, county, and commune levels have been established like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

After the Shandong Province proletarian revolutionaries achieved the great victory of seizing power in February last year, they continued to follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao. The province quickly achieved basic revolutionary unity. However, due to the emergence of factionalism within the revolutionary ranks and the influence of anarchist trends, and due to the sabotage activities of a handful of class enemies, some regions and units were unable to achieve revolutionary unity in a timely manner; or after achieving organizational unity, they were unable to further consolidate it ideologically. Some units that had already achieved revolutionary three-in-one combination also found it difficult to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation well, and some even experienced setbacks. Thus, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism became two major disasters hindering the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the achievement of a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." The study classes jointly held by representatives from various places to eradicate factionalism and anarchism achieved immediate results. Representatives from regions and units where the two factions had not yet united studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions repeatedly in the study classes, raising the issue of whether to seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the level of attitude towards Chairman Mao, towards Mao Zedong Thought, and towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They emphasized the need to carry forward the revolutionary study style of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought advocated by Chairman Mao. Then, the two factions sat together to thoroughly expose the harm of the "two major evils," completely denounce factionalism and anarchism, and reached an agreement to achieve revolutionary unity, laying the foundation for truly achieving revolutionary unity in thought. The two factions in Junan County were once close comrades who fought their way out from under the rule of the bourgeois reactionary line. After victory, both sides showed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, giving the class enemy an opportunity to exploit, and since then, they have been engaged in "internal war" without rest. Before coming to Jinan to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class, both sides had their own "strategic deployments" and brought materials to attack each other, preparing to "fight internally and externally, coordinate above and below" to defeat the other side in one fell swoop. In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, both sides examined their own factionalism, and under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, quickly achieved revolutionary unity. Representatives from regions and units that had already achieved revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination also deeply examined and thoroughly investigated the manifestations of the "two major evils" in the study classes, digging up the roots of the "two major evils," and clearing obstacles for the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their regions and units.

Representatives from regions like Qingdao, Changwei, and Tai'an, where revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination were relatively well-established, also seriously eradicated factionalism and anarchism in the study classes. They believed that even in places where revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination had been achieved, there was still factionalism to be rooted out. For example, among those who rebelled early and late in the revolution, and between revolutionary masses and those who were once misled, there were still phenomena of closeness and distance. How the temporary power organs of the three-in-one combination correctly treat the masses who once took the wrong side or opposed them during the Cultural Revolution is also a very important issue. Through study, they further realized that if factionalism is not thoroughly eliminated in the process of seizing power, it will bring great harm to the revolutionary cause.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes held by representatives from various places played a good role in promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in various regions and units. In the high tide of eradicating factionalism and anarchism across the province, some counties, factories, enterprises, and institutions that had not previously achieved unity quickly achieved revolutionary unity. Previously, about ten percent of the counties in the province had not achieved unity or had achieved poor unity, and this time most of them solved the problem relatively thoroughly. Pingyi County, located in the revolutionary base area of the Yimeng Mountains, had long been unable to achieve unity between the two factions. Recently, the leaders of the two factions examined their own factionalism and anarchism in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, and under the leadership of the leaders, the upper and lower levels combined, and the study class combined internally and externally to thoroughly eradicate factionalism, quickly achieving revolutionary unity across the county. The two factions in Rongcheng County, through further studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, found the main reason for their long-term inability to unite was factionalism. They used to be "two grabs and one struggle," that is, mutually grabbing each other's shortcomings and errors, mutually grabbing bad leaders, and struggling for the core; now it has become "two finds and one lets go," that is, each side finds its own shortcomings and errors, each side finds bad leaders, and the "core" is given to those who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries in Shandong Province are waging a magnificent "people's war" to eradicate factionalism and overthrow anarchism. On the basis of exterminating the two major evils of factionalism and anarchism, the proletarian revolutionaries across the province have blown the advance signal for fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even more loudly. Various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are currently prevalent in cities and rural areas, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought across the province to a new high. Factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools in cities generally held three to five or even a dozen Mao Zedong Thought study classes. About eighty-five percent of the counties in rural areas held study classes extensively and well. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants in the study classes insisted on "criticizing the self and opposing revisionism" as the key, using the "Old Five Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as weapons to criticize the self and oppose revisionism, achieving immediate results, further consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

    树立理论联系实际革命好学风
    围剿派性和无政府主义两大害
    山东省革委会召集全省各地革命派、解放军支左部队和革命领导干部代表，联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，有力地促进和巩固了各地革命大联合和三结合
    新华社济南一日电　山东省革命委员会最近召集全省无产阶级革命派代表、人民解放军支左部队代表和革命领导干部代表，来济南联合举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，集中力量围剿当前阻碍全面落实毛主席最新指示的两大害——资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义。这些学习班发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，收到了很好的效果，并且很快影响到全省各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织，促进了广大无产阶级革命派的思想革命化。目前，一个认真克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义的革命群众运动，正在山东全省普遍深入地开展起来。从鲁西平原到胶东半岛，从沂蒙山区到黄海之滨，革命大联合和革命三结合的形势比以往任何时候都好。据统计，目前全省十三个专区和市，已有十一个从上到下全部实现了革命的大联合；县一级的行政单位，有百分之九十七实现了革命大联合。专区、县和公社的革命委员会，也象雨后春笋般地建立起来。
    山东省无产阶级革命派团结对敌，在去年二月取得夺权斗争的伟大胜利以后，继续紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，全省很快基本上实现了革命的大联合。但是，由于革命派内部出现的派性和受无政府主义思潮的影响，由于一小撮阶级敌人的破坏活动，有少数地区和单位没有能及时实现革命的大联合；或者实现了组织上的大联合后，没有能在思想上进一步巩固起来。有些已经实现革命三结合的单位，也因此不能很好地进行斗批改，有的甚至产生了一些反复。这样，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义就成了全面落实毛主席最新指示、夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的两大祸害。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”各地代表联合举办的毛泽东思想学习班，围剿派性和无政府主义取得了立竿见影的效果。两大派尚未联合的地区和单位的代表，在学习班上反复学习毛主席的最新指示，把是否认真落实毛主席的最新指示，提高到对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的态度上来认识，并且强调要发扬毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风。然后两派在一起大摆“两大害”的危害，彻底搞臭派性和无政府主义，达成了实现革命大联合的协议，为从思想上真正实现革命的大联合奠定基础。莒南县的两大派过去是从资产阶级反动路线统治下冲杀出来的亲密战友，因为胜利以后双方出现了资产阶级和小资产阶级派性，被阶级敌人钻了空子，从此“内战”不休。来济南举办毛泽东思想学习班以前，双方都有各自的“战略部署”，都带了攻击对方的材料，准备“内战外打，上下配合”，一举把对方击溃。在毛泽东思想学习班上，通过学习毛主席的最新指示，双方各自检查了自己的派性，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，很快实现了革命大联合。已经实现革命大联合和革命三结合的地区和单位的代表，也在学习班上从各方面深查、细找“两大害”的表现，挖掘产生“两大害”的根源，为搞好本地区、本单位的斗批改扫除障碍。
    革命大联合和革命三结合搞得比较好的青岛、昌潍、泰安等地区的无产阶级革命派代表，也在学习班上认真围剿派性和无政府主义。他们认为，就是已经实现了革命大联合和革命三结合的地方，也有派性可挖。比如，在革命造反较早和较晚的人们之间，在革命派和一度受蒙蔽的群众之间，有些人仍有亲此疏彼的不团结现象。三结合的临时权力机构如何正确对待在文化大革命中一度站错队的或者曾经反对过自己的群众，也是一个很重要的问题。他们通过学习进一步认识到，在掌权过程中如果不彻底铲除派性，就会给革命事业带来极大的危害。
    各地代表举办的毛泽东思想学习班，对各地区、各单位的无产阶级文化大革命起了很好的推动作用。在全省上下围剿派性和无政府主义的高潮中，有些过去一直没有实现大联合的县、工厂、企业和机关，很快实现了革命的大联合。过去全省约有百分之十左右的县没有联合或联合得不好，这次大部分都比较彻底地解决了问题。地处沂蒙山区革命老根据地的平邑县，过去两大派长期联合不起来。最近两派的头头在毛泽东思想学习班上各自检查了自己组织的派性和无政府主义，在头头带动下，上下结合，学习班内外结合，彻底围剿派性，全县迅速实现了革命大联合。荣成县两大派通过进一步学习毛主席的最新指示，找出长期不能联合的原因，主要是派性作怪。他们过去是“两抓、一争”，即互相抓对方的缺点、错误，互相抓坏头头，争自己作核心；现在变成了“两找、一让”，即各自找自己组织的缺点、错误，各自找坏头头，把“核心”让给高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的人。
    山东省广大无产阶级革命派掀起的这场波澜壮阔的围剿派性和打倒无政府主义的“人民战争”还正在发展。在围歼派性和无政府主义两大害的基础上，全省无产阶级革命派把全面落实毛主席最新指示、夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军号吹得更加响亮。各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班目前遍及城市和乡村，把全省活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了一个新的高潮。城市里的工厂、企业、机关、学校，一般都举办了三、五期或十几期毛泽东思想学习班。农村有百分之八十五左右的县，学习班办得比较广泛、比较好。广大贫下中农在学习班中坚持以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老五篇”和毛主席的最新指示为武器斗私批修，取得了立竿见影的效果，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
