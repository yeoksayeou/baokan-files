“Treading through the green mountains, one does not grow old; the scenery here is uniquely beautiful.”
The People's Liberation Army Engineering Corps has long been fighting in deep mountains, dense forests, deserts, and high plateaus, where the working and living conditions are extremely harsh. However, the heroic engineering soldiers, with "unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, kicking away all difficulties and dangers," view the arduous construction tasks and living conditions as opportunities to temper their revolutionary spirit and fighting will, promoting the ideological revolutionization of the troops. They take pride in hardship, find joy in hardship, and regard hard struggle as an important symbol of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. With a red heart and iron hands, they have overcome one difficulty after another, achieved one victory after another, and made significant contributions to the socialist construction and national defense construction of our motherland.

The following articles are a few short stories reflecting the fighting life of the engineering troops, reported by our correspondents.

“Wherever the people's engineers march, wherever it's harsh, there they make their home…” In the Gobi desert, in the depths of the forest, in places where no one has ever been, the singing of the engineering soldiers echoes everywhere. To defend Chairman Mao and to carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end, they have traversed the mountains and rivers of our motherland. Every drop of sweat is a testament to their loyalty to the Party and the people; every red heart is directed towards the great leader Chairman Mao!

This is a deep valley. Surrounded by towering mountains, the clear water river resembles a silver snake, occasionally appearing and disappearing, winding its way down. Deputy Commander Deng Guangming of the Eighth Company of a certain engineering unit led four soldiers to scout ahead for the unit's living quarters. Following the riverbed forward, they stopped on a stretch of rocky terrain. This place is backed by a cliff and faces the river, with a relatively open terrain. The unit decided to "set up camp" and lay out a new "battlefield" here.

They chopped and sawed for a while, setting up six tents on the rocky terrain. Smoke from the cooking fires rose in the valley, and the heroic songs and laughter of the engineering soldiers echoed through the valley. In the evening, they gathered around the bonfire, studying the highest directives: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade does." Gazing at the dimly lit mountains, studying Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings, their hearts were filled with fighting spirit, and their hearts were even closer to Chairman Mao.

Soon, the unit arrived here, and the once quiet valley became lively. The soldiers carried basket after basket of soil from the mountains to level the rocky terrain into a flat foundation; they built cobblestone paths between the tents; they also built stone walls around the tents to block the wind and sand. The soldiers picked up crystal-clear white stones from the riverbank and, with their skilled hands, laid out the image of Tiananmen Gate in front of the tents, carefully inlaying the words "Long Live Chairman Mao!" in five shining letters. Soon, a "tent courtyard" was completed, and this was the "home" of the engineering soldiers.

Inside the tents, portraits of Chairman Mao were hung, and the golden sun rose in their hearts. Although this place is thousands of miles away from Beijing, the soldiers' hearts are tightly connected to Beijing. Every morning, facing the golden sunrise to the east, the soldiers sing "The East Is Red" and wish Chairman Mao eternal life! They begin a day of intense fighting life.

With their heads resting on the green mountains and their feet on the barren beach, life is exceptionally hard. In the summer, the temperature in the high mountains changes drastically, with only 6 degrees Celsius at night and up to 46 degrees Celsius at noon. The tents are like ovens. Unable to sleep during the day, the soldiers bring cool water from the riverbed and splash it on the tent tops for "artificial cooling." Whenever it rains, it rains inside as well as outside; even after the outside stops, the inside continues to drip. Comrades can only use basins to catch the water, and when the basins are not enough, they use bowls. Unable to lie down to sleep, everyone studies Chairman Mao's works with basins on their heads. Comrades say: "Setting up camp in the high mountains and rugged terrain, pitching tents is our home, living in tents with hearts towards the sun, determined to fight against nature and the earth."

The wind on the plateau is particularly strong. When the wind blows, the sky darkens, and flying sand and stones can lift the entire tent. Comrades struggle to pull the tent ropes with their hands, but sometimes they can't even hold on, and sometimes they are dragged along with the tent. Some comrades jokingly say: "We've changed jobs, we're not engineers anymore, we've all become paratroopers!"

In the midst of intense labor, the soldiers' lives remain rich and colorful. Facing the sparsely populated high mountains and deep valleys, they always love to recite Chairman Mao's poems: "The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of the long march, ten thousand rivers and mountains are mere trifles…" They go to work and fight with revolutionary enthusiasm and ambition. They have opened up a small area on the rocky terrain, sometimes playing ball here, sometimes performing artistic programs. On the cliffs, the soldiers wrote these heroic lines:

In the midst of countless mountains by a small river, the engineering soldiers have made their home;
To defend Chairman Mao, their hearts are like red flames;
They vow to fight the mountains, the impassable passes will not hinder them;
In the tents, they temper their loyalty, passing down the spirit of hard work from generation to generation.

In the engineering troops, living in tents for years is a very common thing. The soldiers deeply understand: we live in tents to realize communism in China and the world, to plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought all over the world. Living in tents for the revolution, though hard, is an honor, though hard, it is a joy. Comrades describe the fighting life of the engineering troops as: "Pitching a tent, sowing a seed, pulling out a tent, blooming a flower!" Sowing and blooming again and again, our troops are advancing in great strides on the road of being highly revolutionary and highly combat-ready, striving for a lifelong struggle to welcome a bright red communist new world.

### 人民工兵走天下　哪里艰苦哪安家

　　人民工兵走天下　哪里艰苦哪安家
    “踏遍青山人未老，风景这边独好。”
    人民解放军工程兵部队，长期战斗在深山野林，荒漠高原，工作和生活条件都非常艰苦。但是，英雄的工程兵战士，“无限忠于毛主席，千难万险一脚踢。”他们把艰苦的施工任务和生活条件，看作是锤炼自己的革命精神和斗争意志，促进部队思想革命化的大好机会。他们以艰苦为荣，以艰苦为乐，把艰苦奋斗看作是忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的重要标志。他们凭着一颗红心，一双铁手，克服了一个又一个的困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利，为祖国的社会主义建设和国防建设，作出了重大的贡献。
    这里发表的几篇文章，就是本报通讯员报道的反映工程兵战斗生活的几个小故事。
                          ——编者
    “人民工兵走天下，哪里艰苦哪安家……”在戈壁荒原，在密林深处，在从来没有人到过的地方，到处都响起工程兵战士嘹亮的歌声。为了保卫毛主席，为了将中国革命和世界革命进行到底，他们踏遍祖国的万水千山。每一滴汗水，都凝聚着对党、对人民的忠诚；每一颗红心，都向着伟大领袖毛主席！
    这是一条深深的山谷。四周是巍峨的山峦，清水河好似一条银蛇，时隐时现，蜿蜒而下。工程兵某部八连副连长田光明，带领四个战士打前站，为部队勘察驻地。沿着河沟向前走，他们在一片乱石滩上，停了下来。这儿背靠?岩，面临河水，地形比较开阔。部队决定就在这里“安营扎寨”，摆开新的“战场”。
    他们又砍又锯地忙了一阵，在乱石滩上搭起了六个帐篷。山谷里升起了缕缕炊烟，工兵战士雄壮的歌声和笑声在山谷里回荡。晚上，他们围坐在篝火旁，学习最高指示：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”望着暮色苍茫的群山，学习着毛主席的亲切教导，他们心里充满了战斗的豪情，他们的心和毛主席贴得更紧了。
    很快，部队赶到了这里，寂静的山谷顿时喧腾活跃起来。战士们从山上挑来一筐筐的土，把乱石滩垫成了平坦的地基；帐篷之间修起了一条条卵石小路；帐篷周围还用石头垒成一道道石墙，用以抵挡风砂。战士们从河滩里拾来晶莹洁白的石子，用灵巧的双手，在帐篷前面砌成天安门的图案，精心镶嵌成“毛主席万岁！”五个闪闪发光的大字。很快地，一座“帐篷大院”落成了，这就是工程兵战士的“家”。
    帐篷里挂起毛主席像，金色的太阳从心头升起。这里和北京虽然相隔千山万水，但战士的心呵，和北京紧紧相连。每天早晨，迎着金灿灿的朝霞，面向东方，战士们高唱《东方红》，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！开始了一天紧张的战斗生活。
    头枕青山，脚踏荒滩，生活是异常艰苦的。夏天，高山气温变化大，晚上只有摄氏六度，到中午气温竟高达四十六度，帐篷里象个火炉。睡不着午觉，战士们就从河沟里端来清凉的水，泼在帐篷顶上，来一个“人工冷却”。每逢下雨，外边下，里边也下；外边不下了，里边还在下。同志们只好用盆子接水，盆子不够就用碗。没法躺下睡觉，大家就头顶着盆子学习毛主席著作。同志们说：“高山峻岭把营扎，支起帐篷就是家，身居帐篷心朝阳，战天斗地决心大。”
    高原上的风特别厉害。刮起风来，天昏地暗，飞砂走石，能把整个帐篷刮起来。同志们用手拚命拉住帐篷绳，拉都拉不住，有时候连人都拖着跑。有的战士风趣地说：“我们现在改行了，不当工程兵，都变成伞兵啦！”
    在紧张的劳动中，战士们的生活仍然丰富多彩。面对着人烟稀少的高山深谷，他们总是爱朗诵毛主席的诗句：“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲……”，带着革命的豪情壮志去劳动，去战斗。他们在乱石滩上开辟了一块不大的场地，有时在这里赛球，有时在这里表演文艺节目。在峭壁上，战士们写下了这样豪壮的诗句：
    万山丛中小河边，工兵战士把家安；为了保卫毛主席，丹心似火红艳艳；誓向群山去开仗，雄关险道无阻拦；帐篷之中炼忠心，艰苦作风代代传。
    在工程兵部队，长年累月住帐篷，已经是很平常的事。战士们深深懂得：我们住帐篷，就是为了在中国和全世界实现共产主义，就是为了把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全世界。为革命住帐篷，虽苦犹荣，虽苦犹乐。同志们形容工程兵部队的战斗生活是：“扎一次帐篷播一次种，拔一次帐篷开一片花！”一次又一次地播种、开花，我们的部队正在非常革命化、非常战斗化的道路上大踏步前进，为迎接一个红彤彤的共产主义新世界而奋斗终生。
