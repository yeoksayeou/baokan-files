Indian police illegally entered the Chinese Embassy in India, violating diplomatic privileges. The Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged a strong protest with the Indian government, pointing out that the Indian government's attempt to shift blame using twisted logic and false accusations is absolutely unacceptable.

	New China News Agency, March 10th—On the evening of March 10th, the responsible official from the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China summoned the acting charge d'affaires of the Indian Embassy in China, Shati, to protest strongly against the serious incident where Indian police illegally entered the Chinese Embassy in India on March 6th, violating diplomatic privileges.

	On the afternoon of March 6th, two Indian police officers in uniform and acting suspiciously illegally entered the Chinese Embassy in India, violating our diplomatic privileges. Chinese embassy staff immediately stopped and questioned them. One of them, with the help of Indian police and special agents monitoring the Chinese Embassy, fled the scene; the remaining Indian officer admitted to being an Indian police officer and acknowledged that he had illegally entered the Chinese Embassy. The Chinese Embassy immediately notified the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send someone to take the Indian officer away. The Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent two officials from the Protocol Department, P.S. Pri, to the Chinese Embassy. After inspecting the scene and understanding the facts, the Indian foreign affairs officials admitted that the Indian police's entry into the Chinese Embassy was completely wrong and a serious incident, and promised that such incidents would not happen again. Afterwards, the Indian foreign affairs officials took the Indian officer away.

	The Indian police's entry into the Chinese Embassy, violating diplomatic privileges, is a serious incident for which the Indian government bears unshirkable responsibility and should be seriously dealt with. However, the Indian government used the tactic of the aggressor filing a complaint first, issuing a so-called "protest note" to the Chinese Embassy on March 7th, falsely accusing the Chinese Embassy of "illegally detaining the Indian officer." The Indian government also mobilized its propaganda machinery to slander the Chinese Embassy, and the Indian Parliament was in an uproar, inciting anti-China sentiment. The Indian government's attempt to use such methods of distorting facts and shifting blame to cover up the fact that Indian police illegally entered the Chinese Embassy and violated diplomatic privileges, and to shirk responsibility, is absolutely unacceptable.

	The responsible official from the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Chinese Foreign Ministry demanded that the Indian acting charge d'affaires, Shati, immediately convey the Chinese government's strong protest to the Indian government, demanding that the Indian government seriously handle this incident, and pointed out that the Chinese government reserves the right to make further representations. On March 8th, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in India, Chen Zhaoyuan, also lodged a strong protest with the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding this incident.

　　印度警察非法闯入我驻印度大使馆侵犯我外交特权

　　指出印度政府妄图用颠倒是非倒打一耙的手法来推卸责任是绝对办不到的
    新华社十日讯　三月十日晚，中华人民共和国外交部第一亚洲司负责人约见印度驻华大使馆临时代办沙梯，就三月六日印度警察非法闯入中国驻印度大使馆、侵犯外交特权的严重事件，向印度政府提出强烈抗议。
    三月六日下午，两个身着制服、行动诡秘的印度警察非法闯入中国驻印度大使馆，侵犯我外交特权。中国大使馆人员发现后即叫住询问。其中一人在监视中国大使馆的印度警特的接应下逃跑；留下的印度人供认他是印度警察，并承认他非法闯入了中国大使馆。中国大使馆即通知印度外交部派人前来领走该印警。印度外交部派礼宾司官员皮·斯·普里等二人来中国大使馆。在视察现场和了解事实经过后，印度外交部官员承认，印警闯入中国大使馆是完全错误的，是严重事件，并且表示保证今后不再发生类似事件。之后，印度外交部官员即将该印警带走。
    印度警察闯入中国大使馆，侵犯外交特权，对于这一严重事件，印度政府负有不可推卸的责任，应当严肃处理。但是，印度政府竟然采用恶人先告状的惯技，于三月七日向中国大使馆提出所谓“抗议照会”，诬蔑中国大使馆“非法扣留印警”。印度政府还开动宣传机器，对中国大使馆大肆造谣诽谤，印度议会也为此吵吵嚷嚷，煽动反华情绪。印度政府妄图用这种颠倒是非、倒打一耙的手法，来掩盖印警非法闯入中国大使馆、侵犯外交特权的事实和推卸印度政府的责任，是绝对办不到的。
    中国外交部第一亚洲司负责人要求印度临时代办沙梯将中国政府的强烈抗议立即转达印度政府，要求印度政府严肃处理这一事件，并且指出，中国政府还保留进一步提出交涉的权利。
    三月八日，中国驻印度大使馆临时代办陈肇源也就此事件向印度外交部提出了强烈抗议。
