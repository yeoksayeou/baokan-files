Chairman Mao! You are the power and source of my life!

The representative of the second study session of Mao Zedong Thought among the artillery forces, deputy squad leader of a certain unit, and recipient of the first-class merit citation, Liu Jianlie

Red sun, red sun! The eternal red sun in our hearts! Chairman Mao! You are the great helmsman of the world revolution! You are the great savior of billions of laboring people! You are the power and source that made my life shine again! On March 7, you personally received us, which is the greatest happiness and greatest honor of our lives. I want to sing aloud, sing! I want to shout with joy, shout! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long life to Chairman Mao! I wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

Dear Chairman Mao, it is your brilliant thoughts that transformed me from an ordinary peasant's son into a tough revolutionary soldier of the Mao Zedong era. Last June 7, during a mission, I was severely injured in the head and fell to the ground. Although my brain was seriously injured, the teachings of Chairman Mao were fresh in my mind. Chairman Mao said, "No matter how difficult and painful the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." So, I mustered all my strength, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and stood up firmly, guarding my post and completing the task given to me by the Party and Chairman Mao. Later, in the hospital, I was in a coma for forty-five days. But when I woke up, the first thing I saw was the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, and I couldn't help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Great leader Chairman Mao, it is your great thoughts that taught me to be a good soldier like Ma Xiande.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You taught us, "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Since I was injured in the head, I have forgotten some of my past experiences, but I will never forget the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev attempting to restore capitalism. This time in Beijing, although my memory is still poor and half of my body is paralyzed, when I heard that the representatives were going to hold a meeting to thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and the anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, I eagerly signed up to participate. I will use my actions to denounce the reactionary fallacies spread by these anti-party conspirators aiming to seize power, opposing the emphasis on politics. I will always remember the teachings of Vice Chairman Lin and always emphasize proletarian politics, always emphasize Mao Zedong Thought.

Dear Chairman Mao! Today, standing by your side, a red sun rises in my heart, and a warm current nourishes my heart. I swear to you: To defend you, to defend your great thoughts, to defend your proletarian revolutionary line, I will fear neither climbing mountains of knives nor entering seas of fire! I will forever be loyal to you, forever follow you, and be a red-hearted, firm-willed, tough soldier like Ma Xiande.

    毛主席！您是我生命的力量和源泉  
    炮兵第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表、某部副班长、一等功荣立者  刘建列
    红太阳，红太阳！我们心中永远不落的红太阳！毛主席啊！您是世界革命的伟大舵手！您是亿万劳动人民的大救星！您是我生命重新放出光芒的力量和源泉！三月七日，您老人家亲自接见了我们，这是我们一生最大最大的幸福，最大最大的光荣。我要放声歌唱，歌唱啊！我要纵情欢呼，欢呼啊！毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    敬爱的毛主席啊，是您的光辉思想，使我从一个普通的贫农儿子，迅速成长为一个毛泽东时代的硬骨头革命战士。去年六月七日，在一次执行任务中，我头负重伤，昏倒在地上。当时，尽管我脑组织受了严重创伤，但毛主席的教导在我头脑中记忆犹新。毛主席说：“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”于是，我使出全身力气，呼喊着“毛主席万岁！”坚强地站起来，坚守工作岗位，胜利完成了党和毛主席交给自己的任务。以后，在医院里，四十五天中我一直处在昏睡状态。但当我苏醒过来的时候，第一眼就认出了墙上挂着的毛主席像，情不自禁地喊出了“毛主席万岁！”伟大领袖毛主席，是您的伟大思想，教育我要做一个麦贤得式的好战士。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您教导我们说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”自从我头部负伤以后，过去有些经历都忘了，但是，对中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的罪行，我一辈子也忘不了。这次上北京，虽然我记忆力还十分差，半身还瘫痪着，但当我一听说代表们要开大会彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫以及彭德怀、罗瑞卿的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行，我就积极报名参加。我要用自己的实际行动，痛斥这批反党篡军个人野心家散布的反对突出政治的反动谬论。我要牢记林副主席的教导，永远突出无产阶级政治，永远突出毛泽东思想。
    敬爱的毛主席啊！今天，站在您的身旁，我心中升起了红太阳，一股股暖流，滋润了我的心房。我要向您宣誓：为了保卫您，保卫您的伟大思想，保卫您的无产阶级革命路线，上刀山，下火海，我都在所不惜！我要永远永远忠于您，永远永远跟着您，做一个心红志坚的麦贤得式的硬骨头的好战士。
