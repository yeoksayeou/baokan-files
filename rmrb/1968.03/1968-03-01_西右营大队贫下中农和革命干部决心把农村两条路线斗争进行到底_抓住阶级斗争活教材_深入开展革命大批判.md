The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xiyouying Brigade in Beizhaikou Commune, Xian County, Tianjin, with the help of the propaganda team of the 4704 Unit of the People's Liberation Army, are high-spiritedly carrying out the struggle between the two lines in the countryside, deeply criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this area.

	Active Class Struggle Material

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The distinctive feature of the revolutionary criticism in Xiyouying Brigade is that it uses the examples of class struggle between the two classes and the two lines, especially in the past few years, as active teaching materials. It mobilizes the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to expose, denounce, and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this area have implemented in Xiyouying Brigade.

This brigade was once used by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Xian County as a black stronghold for implementing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the countryside. The party and government power of the brigade was once seized by class enemies who had infiltrated the party. They practiced brutal bourgeois dictatorship over the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang also came to Xiyouying and colluded with a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in this area, even more frantically implementing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

At a critical moment of class struggle, the great socialist education movement began in Xiyouying. The Four Clean-ups work team, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xiyouying to grasp and intensify class struggle. They finally uprooted the nails driven by the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Xiyouying Brigade, making the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao prevail. Through comparison, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xiyouying have a deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and a deep affection for Chairman Mao and his proletarian headquarters. Xu Zhongyi, a revolutionary cadre who had fought against a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in his village for seven years and is now the commander of the militia company, held family criticism meetings several times. Using the facts of the struggle between the two lines, he denounced and criticized the Chinese Khrushchev. Xu Zhongyi angrily denounced: "The agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in this area used the bourgeois reactionary line to label me as a 'counter-revolutionary,' expel me from the party, and even illegally detain me for seven days and seven nights. Why was the struggle so difficult at that time? It was because the Chinese Khrushchev was backing and encouraging his henchmen. I will concentrate all my hatred on the Chinese Khrushchev and will not rest until I thoroughly criticize and expose him!"

His words stirred up his father Xu Yunsheng's bitter tears from before liberation. Xu Yunsheng, full of anger, said: "In the old society where wolves roamed and there was no daylight, in 1938, I fled from Jinghai to Xiyouying due to famine. One daughter starved to death, another daughter was forced to sell herself, my wife was a wet nurse for the landlord and suffered endless abuse, and I carried heavy loads for the landlord for decades. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the pit of fire. But the Chinese Khrushchev advocates the counter-revolutionary fallacies of 'exploitation is meritorious,' 'class struggle is extinct,' 'three freedoms and one contract,' and 'four freedoms,' aiming to restore capitalism and make us return to the evil old society to suffer the exploitation and oppression of the landlords. This guy is more poisonous than a snake and more ferocious than a wolf. He is our mortal enemy. I will not rest in peace until I overthrow and expose him!" His nine-year-old grandson Xu Xuehong, hearing these words, jumped up in anger and said, "The Chinese Khrushchev is a big bad guy, the enemy of the people nationwide. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev, and become a good red successor!"

	The Old Men's Reasoning Team

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xiyouying Brigade, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "one of the important tasks on our ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," with the help of the army, have turned every household into a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. From the white-haired elders to the toddlers, everyone is a critic. The brigade has an "Old Men's Reasoning Team" composed of old poor and lower-middle peasants who voluntarily organize themselves. Carrying Chairman Mao's sacred books, they propagate Mao Zedong Thought and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev wherever they go. They know clearly who are the people of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters and who are the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev; who are good people and who are bad people. They say: "Chairman Mao teaches us 'rebellion is justified.' We are going to rebel against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we fight them; whoever loves Chairman Mao, we are close to them; whoever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we fight side by side with them; whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we firmly fight them." They use their personal experiences to expose and denounce the brutal exploitation and oppression of the class enemies on the poor and lower-middle peasants in the old society, stirring up everyone's hatred for the old society and the Chinese Khrushchev, and concentrating all the new and old grievances on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents.

The "Old Men's Reasoning Team" not only plays a leading role in criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev but also makes great efforts in the struggle against the class enemies' sabotage of the Cultural Revolution. The poor and lower-middle peasants join them in reasoning and fighting, repelling the enemy's fierce attacks and defending the achievements of the "Four Clean-ups." When the class enemies incite and utilize the anarchist trends and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks to attempt to sabotage "grasp revolution, promote production," the "Old Men's Reasoning Team" joins the poor and lower-middle peasants to resist these countercurrents and smash the enemy's plots. These revolutionary old men are vigorous in the revolutionary criticism, working day and night. Once, when the brigade held a criticism meeting, Old Li of the reasoning team could not attend due to illness. But when he heard the slogan "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev" from the meeting site, he could no longer sit still. He insisted that his son help him to the criticism meeting. He said, "Criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev is to defend Chairman Mao and defend the socialist homeland. I will spare no effort to participate." The old men's revolutionary actions educated everyone. The poor and lower-middle peasants all said, "'The Old Men's Reasoning Team' is great. They speak for us poor and lower-middle peasants, and their actions support us. We must unite as one to carry out the revolutionary criticism well!"

	Revolution Through Mao Zedong Thought

The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the full victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in Xiyouying Brigade has never been so grand; people's ideological awareness has never been so high; the spirit of public ownership has never been so firm; and the revolutionary criticism has never been so extensive and deep.

With the help of the army, Xiyouying Brigade has set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The brigade, production teams, and every household of poor and lower-middle peasants have established study classes for criticizing and reforming oneself. In the study classes, more than seventy activists and backbone members who eagerly study Chairman Mao's works have been cultivated. The whole brigade has seen a new high tide of studying, reciting, applying, and singing the "Three Articles." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are now, with sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm, throwing themselves into the fiery spring plowing production campaign; with ten thousand times and ten million times the determination, they are fighting for the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, striving for the full victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman; doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." They resolve that in the new year, they will hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, carry out the revolutionary criticism more extensively and deeply, change the sky of Xiyouying into the sky of Mao Zedong Thought; change the land of Xiyouying into the land of Mao Zedong Thought; change the people of Xiyouying into people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely carry the struggle between the two lines in the countryside to the end.

    西右营大队贫下中农和革命干部决心把农村两条路线斗争进行到底
    抓住阶级斗争活教材　深入开展革命大批判
    本报讯　天津市小站地区北闸口公社西右营大队的贫农下中农和革命干部，在解放军四七○四部队毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席最新指示为纲，深入地展开了农村两条路线斗争，展开了对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区代理人的大揭发、大控诉、大批判。
        阶级斗争的活教材
    毛主席教导我们说：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”西右营大队革命大批判的一个特点，是运用解放后特别是最近几年来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的事例，作为活教材，发动广大贫农下中农和革命干部揭发、控诉、批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在西右营大队所推行的反革命修正主义路线。
    这个大队曾被中国赫鲁晓夫及其在小站地区的代理人当作在农村推行反革命修正主义路线的黑据点。大队的党政大权一度曾为混进党内的阶级异己分子所把持，他们对贫农下中农和革命干部实行残酷的资产阶级专政。反革命修正主义分子周扬也曾经来到西右营，同当地党内一小撮走资派狼狈为奸，更加疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线。
    在阶级斗争的严重时刻，伟大的社会主义教育运动在西右营开始了。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的四清工作队，发动西右营贫农下中农和革命干部大抓狠抓阶级斗争，终于拔掉了中国赫鲁晓夫在小站地区的代理人在西右营大队安下的钉子，使毛主席的无产阶级革命路线占了统治地位。回忆对比，西右营贫农下中农和革命干部对中国赫鲁晓夫格外恨，对毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级司令部格外亲。曾经同村里的党内一小撮走资派斗争七年之久的革命干部、现任民兵连长徐仲义一家，多次召开家庭批判会，运用上述两条路线斗争的事实，控诉、批判中国赫鲁晓夫。徐仲义无比愤怒地控诉：“中国赫鲁晓夫在本地区的代理人，用资产阶级反动路线把我打成‘反革命’，开除我的党籍，甚至非法拘留我七天七夜。为什么当时斗争那么艰苦？就是因为有中国赫鲁晓夫在为他的爪牙撑腰打气。我要把千仇万恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上，不彻底批臭他誓不罢休！”
    一席话，引出了他父亲徐云松解放前的辛酸泪。徐云松满腔愤怒地说：“在那豺狼当道，暗无天日的旧社会，一九三八年我从静海逃荒到西右营，一个女儿活活饿死，一个女儿被逼得卖掉，老伴给地主当奶妈受尽欺负，我给地主扛了几十年长活。是毛主席把我们从火坑中救了出来，可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却鼓吹什么‘剥削有功’、‘阶级斗争熄灭论’、‘三自一包’、‘四大自由’等反革命谬论，他的罪恶目的就是要复辟资本主义，要我们再回到那万恶的旧社会，受地主老财的剥削压迫。这个家伙真是比毒蛇还毒，比豺狼还狠，他是我们贫农下中农的死对头。不批倒批臭他，我死不瞑目！”他九岁的孙子徐学红听了这些话，气得一跳老高，他说：“中国赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋，是全国人民的死敌，俺坚决听毛主席的话，打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，当好红色接班人！”
        老头说理队
    西右营大队的贫农下中农和革命干部，遵循毛主席关于“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，在解放军帮助下，家家户户组成了革命大批判的战场，从白发苍苍的老人，到几岁的娃娃，人人都是批判家。这个大队有一个由贫农下中农老人自动组织起来的“老头说理队”，他们身带毛主席的宝书，走到哪里，就在哪里宣传毛泽东思想，批判中国赫鲁晓夫。谁是毛主席无产阶级司令部的人，谁是中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人；谁是好人，谁是坏人，这些老人心中十分有数。他们说：“毛主席教导我们‘造反有理’，我们就是要造中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反。谁反对毛主席就和他拚，谁热爱毛主席就和他亲，谁符合毛泽东思想就和他并肩战斗，谁反对毛泽东思想就坚决同他斗。”他们以亲身经历给大家揭露控诉旧社会阶级敌人对贫农下中农的残酷剥削和压迫，以苦引苦，激发大家对旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，从而使大家把新仇旧恨，都集中到中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的身上。
      “老头说理队”不仅在对中国赫鲁晓夫的批判中起带头作用，而且在反击阶级敌人破坏文化大革命的斗争中，作了很大努力。贫农下中农一道同他们进行说理斗争，打退了这些家伙的猖狂进攻，保卫了“四清”成果。当阶级敌人煽动和利用革命队伍中的无政府主义思潮和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，妄图破坏“抓革命，促生产”时，“老头说理队”又和贫农下中农一道，顶住了这些逆流，粉碎了敌人的阴谋。这些革命的老人，在革命大批判中老当益壮，日夜奔忙。一次，队里开批判会时，说理队的李大爷因病未能出席，但当他在家听到会场上“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫”的口号声时，就再也坐不住了，硬叫儿子扶着他去参加批判会。他说：“批判中国赫鲁晓夫是为了保卫毛主席，保卫社会主义江山，拚上老命也要参加。”老人们的革命行动，教育了大家，贫农下中农都说：“‘老头说理队’就是好，说话为咱贫农下中农争气，行动为咱贫农下中农撑腰，我们要团结一心把革命大批判搞好！”
        干革命靠毛泽东思想
    毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。西右营大队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，从没有象今天这样声势浩大；人的思想觉悟从没有象今天这样高；“公”字从没有象今天这样立的牢；革命大批判从没有象今天这样广泛深入。
    西右营大队在解放军的帮助下，开办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，大队办，生产队办，贫农下中农家家户户都成立了斗私批修学习班。在学习班里，培养了七十多名学习毛主席著作积极分子和骨干，全队出现了大学、大背、大用、大唱“老三篇”的新高潮。广大贫农下中农和革命干部，正在以冲天的革命干劲，投入热火朝天的春耕生产运动；以千倍万倍的决心，为毛主席最新指示条条落实、全面落实，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而战斗。“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”他们决心在新的一年里，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席最新指示为纲，更广泛、更深入地开展革命大批判，把西右营的天，改变成为毛泽东思想的天；把西右营的地，改变成为毛泽东思想的地；把西右营的人，变成为用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，誓把农村两条路线斗争进行到底。（陆石流）
