The Fire of Revenge
- The Story of Female Militia Member Nguyen Thi Xuan Shooting Down an American "Phantom" Jet

Nguyen Thi Xuan is a militia member from the agricultural cooperative T in Quang Xa District, Quang Binh Province, in North Vietnam. She is only nineteen years old. Her mother was killed by French aggressor planes during the anti-French resistance war, and her brother, Ah Man, died heroically while fighting against American aggressor planes. The crimes of the invaders planted the seeds of hatred in the young heart of Nguyen Thi Xuan.

In 1966, Nguyen Thi Xuan proudly joined the militia and was issued a rifle. She cherished it as she would her own eyes, cleaning it every day and eagerly awaiting the moment to engage the enemy. That day finally came. On September 20, 1967, Nguyen Thi Xuan happily accepted the duty from her squad leader to strike down the American air invaders. There was a heavy machine gun in the trench where Ah Xuan was stationed, and she loved it. However, since she had never fired a heavy machine gun before, she was a bit worried about whether she could learn to use it. The platoon's political instructor, Nguyen Van Huu, told her, "Don't worry. You have to dare to dive in to learn how to swim."

With the encouragement of the political instructor, Nguyen Thi Xuan worked hard to learn how to aim and observe, and she resolved to take down any enemy plane that dared to attack.

On December 6, thick clouds covered the entire mountaintop. Nguyen Thi Xuan thought, "The cunning enemy will surely take this opportunity to launch a sneak attack. I must punish it severely!"

At 2 PM, two American "Phantom" jets sneaked in under the cover of thick clouds. Nguyen Thi Xuan quickly turned the gun barrel in the direction of the enemy planes' sound. One enemy plane flew low over a village on the south bank, but Ah Xuan did not engage it. She thought, "Hmph! I'll take you down when you fly over the position." The second American plane appeared. It headed straight for Ah Xuan's position, its nose and wings growing larger. Nguyen Thi Xuan calmly waited until the plane flew very low and close, then she locked it in her sights and began firing. In the blink of an eye, more than twenty bullets of hatred pierced the American "Phantom" jet. The enemy plane caught fire, exploded, and crashed into the sea.

Seeing the American aggressor plane fall into the vast ocean, Nguyen Thi Xuan's heart was filled with indescribable joy. She knew clearly that the American aggressors would not accept their defeat. Therefore, as soon as the battle ended, she quickly cleaned her gun, prepared for the next battle, and resolved to annihilate more air invaders.

    复仇的怒火
    ——记女民兵阮氏春击落美国“鬼怪”式飞机
    阮氏春是越南北方广平省广泽县T农业社的民兵，今年才十九岁。她的母亲在抗法战争时期被法国强盗飞机杀害，哥哥阿芒在反击美国强盗飞机的战斗中英勇牺牲。侵略者的罪行在阮氏春年幼的心灵里播下了仇恨的火种。
    一九六六年，阮氏春光荣地加入了民兵，领到一支步枪。她象爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护枪支，每天都把它擦得亮亮的，焦急地盼望着歼敌的时刻早日到来。
    这一天终于盼来了。一九六七年九月二十日，阮氏春高兴地接受了队长的值勤命令，去打击美国空中强盗。阿春所在的战壕里架着重机枪，阿春非常喜欢它。但由于没有打过重机枪，心里不免有点担心是否能学会。连队指导员阮文惠对她说：“你不要担心，要敢于下水才能学会游泳。”
    在指导员的鼓励下，阮氏春下功夫学习瞄准、观察，并下决心一定要揍下敢于来犯的敌机。
    十二月六日，密云遮盖了整个山顶。阮氏春心想：“狡猾的敌人一定会乘机来偷袭。一定要狠狠惩罚它！”
    下午二时，两架美国“鬼怪”式飞机借着浓密的云雾偷偷窜了进来。阮氏春随着敌机的声音迅速地转动着枪口。一架敌机向南岸边村庄低飞，阿春没有理它。她心想：“哼！等你朝阵地飞来，我才揍你。”第二架美国飞机出现了。它向阿春所在的地方直冲过来，机头和机翼越来越大。阮氏春沉着地等它飞得很低很近时，把它箝在瞄准圈里，开始射击。说时迟，那时快，二十多发仇恨的子弹直穿美国“鬼怪”式飞机。敌机在空中冒火、爆炸，倒栽入海。
    看到美国强盗飞机坠入茫茫大海，阮氏春心里充满了难以形容的喜悦。她清楚地知道，美国强盗绝不会甘心于它们的失败。因此，战斗一结束，她就抓紧时间擦枪，准备投入新的战斗，决心歼灭更多的空中强盗。
