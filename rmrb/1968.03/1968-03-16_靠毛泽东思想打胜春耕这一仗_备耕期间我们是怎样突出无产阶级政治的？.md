Winning the spring ploughing production battle depends on what? The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xipu Brigade, Jianming Commune, have come to the conclusion that it depends on the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Once spring ploughing gets busy, people's thoughts also get busy. It seems like it's just a shovel of dirt, a pickaxe of soil, a basket of fertilizer, but in reality, within this shovel, pickaxe, and basket, there is often a struggle between public and private interests, a question of for whom, a question of whether to cultivate for the revolution or for work points. It is either the "public" leading the way or the "private" taking the lead, either proletarian politics leading the way or bourgeois ideology causing trouble. The busier the spring ploughing, the more intense the struggle, the more rounds of conflict, and the sharper the clash between the two worldviews.

Since the beginning of spring, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of our Xipu Brigade have consistently placed emphasis on proletarian politics. This approach is also based on our summary of past experiences and lessons. Before the Cultural Revolution, during a certain period, due to the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agent in Hebei Province, some of our production teams neglected political work during the busy production season, and some teams even implemented "small piecework" for a time, aiding the class enemy in restoring capitalism. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our brigade has followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, intensively studied Chairman Mao's works, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and repudiation, raised the political awareness of cadres and community members, and done a good job in all farm activities. During the summer harvest period last year, planting, managing, and harvesting were all crammed together, but because we insisted on turning the fields and field edges into classrooms for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and into battlefields for criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev, community members were all spirited, and the production tasks were completed at a high standard.

This year, from the beginning of the preparation for spring ploughing, we have focused on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the fundamental task. Preparing for spring ploughing, we first prepared our thoughts for cultivating for the revolution; arranging spring ploughing measures, we first studied specific measures for thought revolutionization; checking the progress of spring ploughing preparations, we first checked the progress of criticizing and repudiating revisionism. In short, by focusing on the shovel, pickaxe, and basket, we can grasp the essence of eliminating private interests and establishing public interests, and many problems can be addressed at the root.

Chairman Mao said: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." He also said: "Running study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The key to emphasizing politics during the busy spring ploughing season is to grasp this fundamental aspect. Our approach is to grasp the universal ideological issues during the busy spring ploughing season and the various ideological problems that hinder the implementation of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and to address these issues through various types of study classes.

Since last winter, our Jianming Commune and Xipu Brigade have held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, solving many problems. For example, at the beginning of the preparation for spring ploughing, some brigade cadres were criticized by the masses during the movement and felt uncomfortable, with the words "grudge," "fear," and "difficulty" tying up their hands and feet, not daring to speak, act, fearing to offend people and be blamed; some brigades, due to the mischief of some people's bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, could not release the cadres in time; some community members, starting from "self," did not follow the correct leadership of the cadres and did not observe labor discipline; some brigades, when implementing the production plan, wanted to reduce the area of high-yield crops; some community members were busy building houses and managing private plots, causing conflicts with the collective over labor, fertilizer, and water. We addressed these problems by holding study classes, studying Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and his latest instructions, criticizing and repudiating revisionism. At the same time, we also focused on class education through recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness. Through the study, the community members' class consciousness was greatly enhanced, and the above series of problems were raised to the level of which side to stand on, who to follow, and which path to take; raised to the level of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; and raised to the level of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world. We firmly established the spirit of loyalty, thoroughly criticized and repudiated selfishness, and firmly established public interests, quickly implementing the spirit of "use." After the study, cadres who wanted to shirk responsibility stood up straight, spoke what needed to be said, managed what needed to be managed, did what needed to be done, and changed what needed to be changed. Some community members overcame anarchism and voluntarily observed labor discipline, using Mao Zedong Thought as the standard to judge right and wrong. Each brigade implemented the production plan, insisting on the socialist direction, considering the overall situation, recognizing the whole, and properly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants further established the idea of cultivating for the revolution, with clear minds and boundless energy, focusing their hearts on the collective and exerting their strength for the collective.

Our brigade, because the political work was grasped early and deeply during the preparation for spring ploughing, fought a proactive battle, achieving unity between cadres and community members, focusing on the revolution, and vigorously promoting production.

During the busy spring ploughing season, how can politics better lead production? The situation during the busy farming season is different from that during the slack season. Chairman Mao said: "When the revolutionary situation has changed, revolutionary strategy and revolutionary leadership methods must also change accordingly." Following Chairman Mao's instruction, based on the characteristics of spring ploughing production, we changed the Mao Zedong Thought study classes originally held collectively by the brigade and production teams into classes held by courtyards and households. The members of the brigade center group and the production team guidance group all went deep into the communities to help community members study. In winter, the Mao Zedong Thought study classes were mainly held indoors, but now the fields and field edges have all become battlefields for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Cadres, study guides, and active members of studying Chairman Mao's works are interspersed with the community members, ensuring that wherever there are community members, there are people organizing study. In the past, study time was relatively fixed, but now it is early in the morning and late in the evening that cadres and community members engage in criticizing and repudiating revisionism at home, study Chairman Mao's quotations during rest periods in the fields, and sing Mao Zedong Thought in labor chants, thus ensuring that political work leads every farm activity and every corner.

With the arrival of the busy farming season, community members are scattered in their work, and the battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism also expands. Therefore, cadres go deep into the masses, roll with the masses, work together, study together, and criticize and repudiate revisionism together. In this way, active thoughts can be discovered in a timely manner, and ideological and political work can be done accurately. With unity between cadres and the masses, everyone's revolutionary spirit is vibrant, powerfully promoting spring ploughing production.

At present, in our Xipu Brigade, politics truly leads everything, and all production tasks are done faster and better than in previous years. The base fertilizer for the spring fields has been fully delivered to the fields, all tools have been repaired and ready, seeds have been selected and prepared, plans have been implemented, and small-scale water conservancy projects such as dike construction and dam construction are under intense construction. In short, a good foundation has been laid for achieving a bumper harvest this year.

### 靠毛泽东思想打胜春耕这一仗——备耕期间我们是怎样突出无产阶级政治的？

　　靠毛泽东思想打胜春耕这一仗
　　——备耕期间我们是怎样突出无产阶级政治的？
　　王国藩
    打胜春耕生产这一仗靠什么？我们建明公社西铺大队贫下中农的体会是，靠伟大的毛泽东思想。
    春耕一忙，人的思想也就忙起来了。看来是一锨泥、一镐土、一筐粪，实际上在这一锨、一镐、一筐里，常常有公与私的斗争，有为谁的问题，有为革命种田还是为工分种田的问题。不是“公”字挂帅，就是“私”字当头，不是无产阶级政治挂帅，便是资产阶级思想作怪。春耕越忙，这种斗争越激烈，交锋的回合越多，两种世界观的冲突越尖锐。
    入春以来，我们西铺大队贫下中农和革命干部，一直把突出无产阶级政治放在首位。这样做，也是从总结过去的经验教训中得来的。文化大革命以前的一个阶段，由于中国赫鲁晓夫和他在河北省的代理人推行反革命修正主义路线，使我们的一些生产队在生产大忙时期忽视了政治工作，个别队还一度实行过“小包工”，为阶级敌人复辟资本主义帮了忙。无产阶级文化大革命以来，我们大队紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓毛主席著作的学习，深入开展革命的大批判，提高了干部和社员的政治觉悟，各项农活都做得很好。去年夏收时期，种、管、收挤在一起，由于我们坚持把田间、地头变成活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，变成批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战场，社员们个个精神焕发，高标准地完成了生产任务。
    今年备耕一开始，我们就把活学活用毛主席著作，落实毛主席最新指示，当作根本中的根本来抓。抓春耕准备，首先抓了为革命种田的思想准备；安排春耕措施，首先研究思想革命化的具体措施；检查备耕进度，首先检查斗私批修的进度。总之，透过一锨、一镐、一筐来抓破私立公，许多问题就能抓到点子上。
    毛主席说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”又说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”春耕大忙突出政治是根本，怎样才能抓住这个根本呢？我们的做法是：抓住春耕大忙时期带有普遍意义的活思想，抓住阻碍落实毛主席伟大战略部署的各种思想问题，带着这些问题办好各种类型的学习班。
    我们建明公社和西铺大队，去冬以来办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，解决了许多问题。比如，备耕开始时，一部分队干部在运动中受过群众批评，心里不舒畅，“怨”字、“怕”字、“难”字缠住了手脚，不敢说，不敢做，怕得罪人落埋怨；有的队由于有些人的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，干部迟迟解放不出来；个别社员从“私”字出发，不服从干部的正确领导，不遵守劳动纪律；个别队在落实生产计划时，想减少高产作物面积；个别社员忙于盖房子，搞自留地，发生与集体争工、争肥、争水的现象。我们就带着这些问题，举办了学习班，学习毛主席的“老三篇”和最新指示，斗私批修。同时还抓了忆苦思甜的阶级教育。经过学习，社员的阶级觉悟大大提高，把上述一系列问题提到站在那一边、跟谁走、走什么道路的高度上来认识，提到忠不忠于毛主席、忠不忠于毛泽东思想、忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的高度来认识；把备耕工作提到夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利、支援越南人民和世界人民革命斗争的高度来认识，大树“忠”字，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，迅速落实“用”字。经过学习，想撂挑子的干部，挺起了腰杆，该说的说，该管的管，该做的做，该改的改。一些社员克服了无政府主义，自觉地遵守劳动纪律，事事用毛泽东思想作为衡量是非的标准。各队落实生产计划，坚持社会主义方向，顾大局，识整体，摆正了国家、集体、个人三者的关系。广大贫下中农进一步树立了为革命种田的思想，心明眼亮，浑身是劲，心放在集体上，劲使在集体上。
    我们大队由于备耕中政治工作抓得早，抓得深，打了主动仗，做到干部、社员一条心，狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    在春耕大忙的时候，怎样才能使政治更好地统帅生产呢？农忙和农闲的情况不一样。毛主席说：“当着革命的形势已经改变的时候，革命的策略，革命的领导方式，也必须跟着改变。”我们按照毛主席这一教导，根据春耕生产的特点，把原来大队、生产队集中办的毛泽东思想学习班，改成院办、户办的学习班。大队中心组、生产队辅导组的同志，都深入下去帮助社员学习。冬季办毛泽东思想学习班主要是在室内，现在田间、地头都成了斗私批修的阵地。干部、学习辅导员、学习毛主席著作积极分子跟社员插在一起，做到哪里有社员，哪里就有人组织学习。过去学习时间是比较固定的，现在是一早一晚干部、社员在家里搞斗私批修，地头休息时学习毛主席语录，劳动号子喊语录，这就做到了政治工作统帅每一种农活，每一个角落。
    随着农活大忙到来，社员干活分散了，斗私批修战场也就随着扩大了。因此干部深入到群众中间去，跟群众滚在一起，同劳动，同学习，同斗私批修。这样，活思想能及时发现，思想政治工作能做到点子上。干部群众一条心，个个革命精神振奋，有力地推动了春耕生产。
    目前，在我们西铺大队，政治真正统帅一切，各项生产都比往年搞得又快又好。春田底肥已经全部送到地里，农具全都修好配齐，种子选好备足，计划已经落实，修渠挡坝等小型水利工程正在紧张施工，总之，为夺取今年农业大丰收已经打了一个良好的基础。
