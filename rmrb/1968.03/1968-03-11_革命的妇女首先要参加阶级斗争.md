Our great leader Chairman Mao has always shown great concern for the liberation of women and has always attached great importance to the role of women. He has called on women to "unite, participate in production and political activities, and improve their economic and political status." Only by following Chairman Mao's instructions can women achieve complete liberation and fully play their role in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment.

Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the broad masses of working women in our country have broken through countless shackles, overcome numerous difficulties, and played a tremendous role in the democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction. The economic and political status of women has fundamentally improved, and many heroic and model figures have emerged, such as Liu Huilan and Xiang Xiuli, who are outstanding representatives of women. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, millions of revolutionary women have greatly enhanced their proletarian consciousness and contributed their strength to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Among the delegates attending this conference on active learners of Chairman Mao's works, there are many women comrades, who are advanced elements in the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works on various fronts.

The Chinese Khrushchev, who is soaked from head to toe with bourgeois poison, pretends to care about women and says, "There have been few female politicians in history. How can one be a female politician when one has to get married and raise children?" He also says, "The central task of women's work is also to engage in production. If production is not good, one cannot eat well." The Chinese Khrushchev has never looked down on women and has never allowed women to revolt. His intention in saying this is to make the broad masses of women "hear nothing of world affairs with two ears and spend a lifetime around the three stoves," tying women to the small circle of the family, and putting heavy shackles on women again, dragging them back to the position of oppression and slavery in the old society.

The central task of women's work is to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to carry out the thought revolution of the people, to make the broad masses of women focus on politics, participate in class struggle, and care about national and international affairs. Only in this way can the broad masses of women continuously improve their proletarian consciousness and fully give play to their enthusiasm and creativity. If we follow the Chinese Khrushchev's words, women will never be liberated.

The Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies are actually nothing new. Under the rule of feudalism and capitalism, all exploiting and oppressing classes have driven women back to the kitchen. The Chinese Khrushchev is just following in their footsteps. His counter-revolutionary revisionist line on women's movement is a part of his entire counter-revolutionary revisionist line. However, as our great leader Chairman Mao teaches, "Opportunists who try to block the tide, though they may exist almost everywhere, cannot block the tide." The Chinese Khrushchev's efforts to oppose our women's revolution will only end in a shameful failure.

　　革命的妇女首先要参加阶级斗争

    我们的伟大领袖毛主席历来极为关怀妇女的解放，极为重视妇女的作用，号召妇女“团结起来，参加生产和政治活动，改善妇女的经济地位和政治地位”。只有按照毛主席指示去做，妇女才能获得彻底的解放，才能充分发挥她们在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验这三项伟大革命运动中的作用。
    我国广大劳动妇女，在伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，冲破层层束缚，克服种种困难，在民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设中发挥了巨大的作用。妇女的经济地位和政治地位也得到了根本的改善，并且涌现出许多英雄模范人物，象刘胡兰、向秀丽等就是妇女中间杰出的代表。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，亿万革命妇女群众更是大大地提高了无产阶级觉悟，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利贡献自己的力量。出席我们这次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的，就有不少女同志，她们就是各条战线上活学活用毛主席著作的先进分子。
    从头到脚每个细胞都浸透着资产阶级毒液的中国赫鲁晓夫，假装关心妇女的样子，胡说：“历史上没有多少女政治家。又要结婚，又要带孩子，如何能做女政治家？”他还胡说什么：“妇女工作的中心任务也是搞生产，生产不好，饭就吃不好。”中国赫鲁晓夫根本就看不起妇女，从来就不许妇女革命。他这样说的企图，就是要让广大妇女“两耳不闻天下事，一生围着三台转”，把妇女拴在家庭的小圈子里，就是又要给妇女加上重重的枷锁，把妇女拉回到旧社会那种被压迫、被奴役的地位。
    妇女工作的中心任务是活学活用毛主席著作，搞好人的思想革命化，使广大妇女突出政治，参加阶级斗争，关心国家大事，关心世界大事。这样才能使广大妇女不断提高无产阶级觉悟，充分发挥她们的积极性和创造性。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫说的去办，妇女就永远得不到解放。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这些谬论，其实不是什么新鲜货色。在封建主义和资本主义统治下，一切剥削压迫阶级，都是要驱使妇女回到厨房去，中国赫鲁晓夫不过是步他们的后尘而已。他的反革命修正主义的妇女运动路线，是他整个反革命修正主义路线的组成部分。但是，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所教导的：“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的”。中国赫鲁晓夫极力反对我们妇女革命，只能落个可耻的下场。
