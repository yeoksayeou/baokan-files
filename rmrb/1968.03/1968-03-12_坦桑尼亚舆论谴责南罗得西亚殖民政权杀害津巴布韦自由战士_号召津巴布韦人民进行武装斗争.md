Tanzanian public opinion has strongly condemned the imperialist-backed Smith colonial regime in South Rhodesia for brutally killing three Zimbabwean freedom fighters, and has called for armed struggle to eliminate the fascist colonialists in Zimbabwe and liberate the country.

The *Nationalist* recently published an editorial stating that the bloody massacre of Zimbabwean freedom fighters by the South Rhodesian fascist regime indicates that the contradiction between the Zimbabwean people and the imperialist-backed fascist colonialists "can only and must be resolved through armed struggle." It said: "This is a life-and-death struggle."

The editorial said that the cowardly hanging of three Zimbabwean freedom fighters by the Smith regime can only arouse the sons and daughters of Zimbabwe to fight back. The editorial called on the Zimbabwean people to wage a resolute struggle, to demand blood debt from Smith and his followers, and to eliminate all fascist colonialists on their land.

The editorial also exposed the hypocrisy of U.S. imperialism, which pretends to oppose but actually supports the Smith regime. The editorial emphasized that the African people will no longer ignore the lives of their brothers and believe the lies and deceits of U.S. imperialism.

The Swahili-language newspaper *Freedom Daily* called on the Zimbabwean people to wage a struggle against the Smith fascist regime in its editorial. The editorial pointed out: "Violence must be met with violence."

The workers of Tanzania expressed great anger over the hanging of the three Zimbabwean freedom fighters. The Tanganyika Federation of Labour issued a statement on the 9th saying: "Only through the use of force can our Zimbabwean brothers be liberated."

　　坦桑尼亚舆论谴责南罗得西亚殖民政权杀害津巴布韦自由战士
　　号召津巴布韦人民进行武装斗争
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆十日电　坦桑尼亚舆论严厉谴责得到帝国主义支持的南罗得西亚史密斯殖民政权残酷杀害三名津巴布韦自由战士，并号召进行武装斗争，消灭在津巴布韦的法西斯殖民主义者，解放这个国家。
    《民族主义者报》最近发表社论指出，南罗得西亚法西斯政权血腥屠杀津巴布韦自由战士，表明津巴布韦人民和得到帝国主义支持的法西斯殖民主义者之间的矛盾，“只有和必须通过武装斗争来解决”。它说：“这是一场生死搏斗。”
    社论说，史密斯政权卑怯地绞死三名津巴布韦自由战士，只能唤起津巴布韦儿女们起来进行斗争。社论号召津巴布韦人民进行坚决的战斗，向史密斯及其追随者讨还血债，消灭在他们国土上的一切法西斯殖民主义者。
    社论还揭露美帝国主义假反对、真支持史密斯政权。社论强调指出，非洲人民再也不会不顾自己兄弟的生命，而去相信美帝国主义的谎话和欺骗。
    斯瓦希利文报纸《自由日报》在社论中号召津巴布韦人民进行针锋相对的斗争，推翻史密斯法西斯政权。社论指出：“必须用暴力来对付暴力。”
    坦桑尼亚工人对三位津巴布韦自由战士被绞死一事，表示了极大的愤怒，坦噶尼喀全国工人联合会九日发表声明说：“只有使用武力，我们的津巴布韦兄弟才能得到解放。”
