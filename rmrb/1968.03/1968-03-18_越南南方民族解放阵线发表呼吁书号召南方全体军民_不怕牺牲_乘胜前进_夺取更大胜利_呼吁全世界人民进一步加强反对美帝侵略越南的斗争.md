The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has issued a call to arms urging all military and civilian personnel in the South to fear no sacrifice, press onward to victory, and calling on people around the world to strengthen the struggle against American imperialist aggression in Vietnam.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, March 17

	According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a call to arms on the eve of the 18th anniversary of the nationwide anti-American struggle on March 19. The call urges people around the world to strengthen their struggle against American imperialist aggression in Vietnam and calls on all military and civilian personnel in South Vietnam to make extraordinary efforts, overcome difficulties, fear no sacrifice, press onward to victory, launch continuous attacks and uprisings, and complete the glorious task of liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately achieving the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

	The call to arms exposes the recent series of plots by American imperialism to escalate the war in Vietnam and its continuous provocations against Cambodia, Laos, China, and Korea. The call points out that American imperialism is the most dangerous and vicious enemy of the Vietnamese people and all peoples of the world.

	The call to arms urges the governments and peoples of various countries to promptly and severely condemn American imperialism and take decisive actions to stop all aggressive acts and war "escalation" plots by American imperialism.

	After discussing how the government and people of Cambodia and the patriotic military and civilian personnel of Laos have consistently supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and have resolutely thwarted all military adventurist acts by the United States and its lackeys to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina Peninsula, the call points out that this not only embodies the spirit of fighting solidarity but also fully conforms to the interests of the peoples of the Indochina Peninsula. The call also urges the progressive people of the United States to stand up and wage a more powerful struggle against the unjust war of aggression policy of the U.S. government.

	The call to arms sternly warns the lackeys of the United States, including Thailand, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines, that they must immediately stop all actions of colluding with American imperialism to invade Vietnam and must withdraw their mercenary troops from South Vietnam. Acting as lackeys of American aggressors will only lead to the same disastrous fate as that of the American aggressors.

	The call to arms urges the military and civilian personnel of South Vietnam to, with the fighting spirit of March 19 and deep hatred for the aggressors and traitors, make extraordinary efforts, overcome difficulties, fear no sacrifice, press onward to victory, launch continuous attacks and uprisings, annihilate more of the enemy's fighting forces, defeat the puppet army, overthrow the puppet regime, smash the American bandits' aggressive plots, achieve greater victories, and gloriously complete the task of liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately achieving the peaceful reunification of the motherland, making active contributions to the cause of all nations opposing American imperialist aggressors and defending world peace.

　　越南南方民族解放阵线发表呼吁书号召南方全体军民
　　不怕牺牲　乘胜前进　夺取更大胜利
　　呼吁全世界人民进一步加强反对美帝侵略越南的斗争
    新华社河内十七日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会在“三·一九”全国抗美斗争日十八周年即将到来的时候发表一项呼吁书，呼吁全世界人民进一步加强反对美帝国主义侵略越南的斗争，并且号召越南南方全体军民作出非凡的努力，克服困难，不怕牺牲，乘胜前进，连续进攻和起义，完成解放南方、保卫北方、进而和平统一祖国的光荣任务。
    呼吁书揭露了美帝国主义最近一系列扩大侵越战争的阴谋和对柬埔寨、老挝、中国、朝鲜等国家不断采取的挑衅行动。呼吁书指出，美帝国主义是越南人民和全世界各国人民的最危险、最凶恶的敌人。
    呼吁书呼吁各国政府和人民及时地严厉谴责美帝国主义，并且采取坚决的行动，制止美帝国主义的一切侵略行径和战争“升级”阴谋。
    呼吁书在谈到柬埔寨政府和人民以及老挝爱国军民一贯支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，并且坚决挫败美国及其走狗企图把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那的一切军事冒险行动以后指出，这不但体现了互相支援的战斗团结精神，而且完全符合印度支那各国人民的利益。呼吁书还呼吁美国进步人民，站起来进行更加强有力的斗争，反对美国当局非正义的侵略战争政策。
    呼吁书中严厉警告泰国、南朝鲜、澳大利亚、新西兰和菲律宾等美国走狗集团：它们必须立即停止同美帝国主义勾结侵略越南的一切行动，必须把它们的帮凶军撤出越南南方。充当美国侵略者的帮凶，就只能遭到同美国侵略者一样的惨败命运。
    呼吁书号召越南南方军民要以“三·一九”的战斗精神和对侵略者和卖国贼的深仇大恨，进一步作出非凡的努力，克服困难，不怕牺牲，向着革命目标，乘胜前进，连续进攻和起义，消灭敌人更多的有生力量，击溃伪军，推翻伪政权，粉碎美国强盗的侵略阴谋，夺取更大的胜利，光荣地完成解放南方、保卫北方、进而和平统一祖国的任务，为各个民族反对美帝国主义侵略者和保卫世界和平的事业作出积极的贡献。
