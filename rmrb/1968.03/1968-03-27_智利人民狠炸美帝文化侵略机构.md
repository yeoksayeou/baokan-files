Under the intensified plundering and exploitation of U.S. imperialism, the Chilean people's struggle against U.S. imperialism is growing stronger. On March 22, the Chilean people used high-powered bombs to blow up the Chilean-American Cultural Institute in the city of Rancagua. This U.S. cultural invasion tool was blown to smithereens, and Johnson's portrait was shattered into pieces. Additionally, in the capital Santiago, 6,000 power workers, in protest against the ruthless exploitation by U.S. monopoly capital, also held a protest strike on the 18th.
