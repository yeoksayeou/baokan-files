The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Baoshan County, Shanghai suburbs, are following Chairman Mao's directive that "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture." With the help of the People's Liberation Army, they are constructing farmland water conservancy projects and expanding the area of irrigation, creating favorable conditions for a bumper harvest this year. This is a scene of members of the Wusong People's Commune working hard to excavate a river channel.
