We are bank employees. In the past period, we encountered some units and mass organizations that, disregarding the overall interests of the state, only cared about the interests of their own unit and faction, arbitrarily violating financial and economic regulations. For example, some unit leaders, using their authority, think of all kinds of ways and create false pretexts to use surplus funds. Some units' large amounts of business income in cash, not only do not deposit it into the bank as stipulated by the state, but also argue unreasonably: "This is our unit's business, we can do whatever we want!" Some units even arbitrarily divert production working capital; or, under the pretext of support, lend production funds to each other. There are even some units that, because they have not yet merged, the two factions do not jointly manage the financial authority according to state regulations, but instead open separate accounts at the bank, disregarding state interests and the people's interests, not abiding by laws and regulations themselves, and refusing to accept the supervision of the state bank.

The above practices not only disrupt the state's financial and economic plans but also affect national production and construction. However, they call this "breaking old frameworks." This is very wrong.

Chairman Mao's great directive to "further economize and make revolution" is the principle that we financial and economic workers must follow. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly guard our posts, resolutely act according to policies and regulations, and firmly fight against behaviors that violate state financial and economic regulations, safeguarding the financial authority of the proletariat and safeguarding the political power of the proletariat.

　　不要违反财经制度
    我们是银行工作人员。前一时期，在工作中遇到有的单位和群众组织，不顾国家整体利益，只顾本单位和本派的利益，任意违反财经制度。例如有的单位领导人，利用职权，想方设法，巧立名目，动用结余资金。有的单位业务收入的大量现金，不但不按国家规定存入银行，还强词夺理地说：“这是我们单位的事，爱怎么办就怎么办！”有的单位甚至随意挪用生产流动资金；或者以支援为名，互借生产资金。还有个别单位，因尚未联合，两派不按国家规定联合掌好财权，而是在银行各立账户，什么国家利益，人民利益都置之度外，自己不遵守法令制度，又拒不接受国家银行的监督。
    以上这些做法，既打乱了国家财经计划，又影响了国家生产建设。但他们却美其名曰“破旧框框”。这是很不对的。
    毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，是我们财经工作人员必须遵照执行的准则。我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，坚守工作岗位，坚决按政策和制度办事，向违反国家财经制度的行为作坚决的斗争，保卫无产阶级的财权，保卫无产阶级的政权。
