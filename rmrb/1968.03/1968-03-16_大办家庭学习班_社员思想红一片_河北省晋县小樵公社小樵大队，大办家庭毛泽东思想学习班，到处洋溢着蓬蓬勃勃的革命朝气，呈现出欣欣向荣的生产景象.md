The Xiaozhao Brigade of Xiaozhao Commune in Jin County, Hebei Province, has extensively established family study classes on Mao Zedong Thought. Everywhere, a vigorous revolutionary spirit is flourishing, and a prosperous production scene is presented.

Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, March 15th — The leadership cadre of Xiaozhao Brigade in Jin County, Hebei Province, following Chairman Mao's great instruction "The serious question of educating the peasants," has taken "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism, Struggle Against Selfishness" as the key, and while holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes at the production brigade level, has mobilized and led all 784 households of poor, lower-middle, and middle peasants in the entire brigade to establish family Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Everywhere in the brigade, a vigorous revolutionary spirit is flourishing, and a prosperous production scene is presented.

Now, every morning when the sun rises, the poor, lower-middle, and middle peasants in Xiaozhao Brigade, from the elderly to the children, together wish long life to the great leader Chairman Mao, recite Chairman Mao's quotations, and sing "The East Is Red." In the evening, the family gathers around the kang (heated bed), studies and applies the "Three Constantly Read Articles," uses "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people as a measure, takes Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the old man of the Yellow River as examples, and examines the day's thoughts and work. This has become the conscious action of every member of the family Mao Zedong Thought study class.

Chairman Mao teaches: "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation." The leadership cadre of Xiaozhao Brigade believes that guiding peasants to study Chairman Mao's works thoroughly is fundamentally to transform the peasants' world outlook: to thoroughly criticize and repudiate "selfishness" and establish "publicness," to eliminate the influence of private ownership left over from thousands of years on the members, to arm the members with Mao Zedong Thought, and to direct the members' actions. Therefore, in the family study classes established in Xiaozhao Brigade, the focus is on studying and applying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" to transform the world outlook.

Is farming for the revolution or for work points? This is the focal point of the struggle between public and private interests among the members. The idea of private ownership makes some peasants regard "earning work points" as the purpose of participating in collective labor. Every household of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xiaozhao Brigade studies the "Three Constantly Read Articles" with this question in mind and consciously criticizes the idea of "farming for work points." One day, an old peasant woman said to her son, "Spring plowing is here, now eat more hardship and earn more work points," using "earn more work points" to urge her son to work. This was heard by the old man, who that night led the family, with this thought in mind, to study the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune." The old man said to his son: Don't listen to your mother, she tells you to suffer a little to gain a lot, that's the way of the Chinese Khrushchev, you should listen to Chairman Mao, be selfless and dedicated, serve the people wholeheartedly. The old woman also studied Chairman Mao's works and made self-criticism, correcting her wrong thoughts.

"Being a cadre is a disadvantage" — some cadres have such active thoughts. The family Mao Zedong Thought study class takes this question and studies Chairman Mao's instructions, helping cadres to criticize and repudiate selfishness and establish publicness. During the initial period of the Cultural Revolution, the members of the fifth production team had posted a few big-character posters criticizing team leader Zhang Xiaoming for his harsh style. Zhang Xiaoming had a knot in his mind, always thinking that being a cadre is troublesome, earning fewer work points, and offending people, all are "disadvantages," and it's better to be an ordinary member. As soon as this thought surfaced, it was seized by the family Mao Zedong Thought study class. The six family members, with this question in mind, studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," held a criticize and repudiate revisionism meeting. Zhang Xiaoming's wife said to Zhang Xiaoming: "Chairman Mao said well: 'All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power.' You must not forget the past hardships after turning over!" Zhang Xiaoming studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and, with the help of his family, his mind became clear. He decided to uproot the "selfishness" in his mind and hold power for the proletariat well. He stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and said excitedly: "Chairman Mao! I will definitely follow your instructions, serve the people wholeheartedly, and work with you for a lifetime of revolution." The next day, he voluntarily checked his thought of wanting to quit with all the team members, bravely took up the heavy responsibilities of revolution and production, and fought on the front line of spring plowing production with the members.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Xiaozhao Brigade are like this, studying and applying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," learning one sentence and using one sentence, the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly is gradually taking root in their minds.

Chairman Mao says: "In the world, the most feared thing is the word 'serious,' and the Communist Party is the most serious." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaozhao Brigade, in order to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, with unlimited love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, with astonishing willpower, overcame various difficulties, and created many effective learning methods, making the family Mao Zedong Thought study classes achieve: low culture is not a hindrance, busy production is not a hindrance, heavy housework is not a hindrance.

The first difficulty encountered by the family study class is low culture. More than 70-80% of the middle-aged and above in the entire brigade are illiterate, but they have a deep proletarian feeling for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They say: "Studying Chairman Mao's works, as long as the determination is great, there is no fear of low culture." Each family study class selects a literate person from the family members to be the tutor. If there is no literate person in the household, they hire one from the neighbors. The tutor reads and explains, and the whole family memorizes and discusses, and uses every opportunity to study. In the morning, women cook and do housework while reviewing Chairman Mao's works; before and after meals, the family gathers around the table to recite Chairman Mao's quotations; before going to bed at night, husbands teach wives, children teach mothers, grandchildren teach grandparents, and they teach each other. Each study session has a little content, but the number of study sessions is high, accumulating little by little, everyone can remember, speak, and use it. Each family study class holds a family criticize and repudiate revisionism meeting every five days, focusing on the revolutionization of thoughts.

What if there is less study time during busy farming seasons? This brigade's family Mao Zedong Thought study class does not wait until the farming season is over to start, but according to the situation that the more busy the farming is, the more the "selfishness" tends to surface, they insist on holding the classes. Their method is: before going to the fields, based on the day's farming work and possible difficulties, study a few relevant quotations from Chairman Mao; during rest time, gather at the field edge or courtyard, everyone recites Chairman Mao's quotations, shares experiences, and holds a study and application meeting; after dinner, the family examines the day's actions based on the highest instructions.

The leadership cadre of Xiaozhao Brigade places leading the members to establish good family Mao Zedong Thought study classes and arming the members with Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work. They adopt the "four grasps" method to help the members establish good family study classes. First, cultivate cadres. The brigade leadership cadre, according to different political tasks and the active thoughts of cadres and members at different times, often holds various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes for cadres, militiamen, "Red Mothers," etc. The members who have studied in these classes generally become the cadres of the family study classes. Second, study plans. They, based on Vice Chairman Lin Biao's proposal to "take the 'Three Constantly Read Articles' as a motto to study" and "study Chairman Mao's works, study with questions, study and apply actively, study and use together, study urgently when needed, see results immediately, and focus on the 'use' word," emphasize that the family study classes should study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles" well, and carry out the revolutionization of people's thoughts. In addition, according to the development of the proletarian cultural revolution, they select a few quotations from Chairman Mao that guide the current struggle and relevant documents every month, distribute them to each family study class, so that they are known to every household and applied actively. Third, inspect and summarize. During the inspection, they carry out the "three inspections and three comparisons" activities. First, inspect the situation of reading every day, compare following Chairman Mao closely; second, inspect whether Chairman Mao's words are remembered, compare studying and applying actively; third, inspect the enthusiasm and consciousness of family members' study, compare the situation of adhering to the study system. Each inspection and summary raises the level by one step. Fourth, grasp the work of tutors. The brigade leadership cadre regularly holds tutor study classes, studies Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, summarizes the work methods of tutors, and helps them learn to grasp active thoughts, so as to organize learning in a targeted manner. The members of the brigade leadership cadre take the lead in studying well, grasp the transformation of world outlook, set an example, and lead the members.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaozhao Brigade reflect that extensively establishing family Mao Zedong Thought study classes has brought about ten major changes in the brigade:

First, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have a deeper proletarian feeling for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and have more unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Second, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has never been as extensive and deep as it is today, and the self-awareness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in transforming their world outlook has never been as high as it is today.

Third, the world outlook of the broad masses of members has undergone great changes. In the past, some members, when facing a matter, often revolved around the "selfishness" circle. Now, when facing a matter, they first think of the collective, the country, the revolution, and the "publicness" first.

Fourth, everyone cares about national affairs. In the past, elderly people in their sixties and seventies who did not hear about world affairs now study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and criticize and repudiate revisionism. In the past, old women who only cared about the stove and a few chickens now criticize the Chinese Khrushchev with their grandchildren.

Fifth, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has deeply entered people's hearts, the members' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has greatly improved, and they criticize errors when they encounter them.

Sixth, the spirit of farming for the revolution and working for the revolution among the members and cadres has been greatly carried forward. In the past, some members worked lightly and feared heavy work, and quarreled over work points. Now, members and cadres rush to do heavy and difficult work, and no one cares about personal rewards.

Seventh, in the past, some members did not care about each other, now if one family has difficulties, the whole team supports them, if one team has difficulties, the whole village supports them, and the spirit of communism has been greatly carried forward.

Eighth, in the past, the family was ruled by the head of the household, now Mao Zedong Thought is used to measure and solve all problems in the family, and a new type of family relationship is being established.

Ninth, the style of work of the cadres has undergone a great change. In the past, cadres liked to issue orders, and did not consult with the masses enough when there were matters. Now, cadres are the small students of the masses, they take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, take the lead in criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and take the lead in labor. Cadres care about the members, and members cherish the cadres.

Tenth, the mass movement of learning from Dazhai is being carried out in depth.

　　大办家庭学习班　社员思想红一片
    河北省晋县小樵公社小樵大队，大办家庭毛泽东思想学习班，到处洋溢着蓬蓬勃勃的革命朝气，呈现出欣欣向荣的生产景象
    新华社石家庄十五日电　河北省晋县小樵公社小樵大队的领导班子遵照毛主席“严重的问题是教育农民”的伟大教导，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在生产大队举办毛泽东思想学习班的同时，发动和领导全大队七百八十四户贫农、下中农和中农家家都办起了家庭毛泽东思想学习班，全大队到处洋溢着蓬蓬勃勃的革命朝气，到处呈现出欣欣向荣的生产景象。
    现在，每天清早，当太阳东升的时候，小樵大队贫农、下中农和中农家家户户从老人到小孩，共同敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，背诵毛主席语录，高唱《东方红》。到夜晚，一家人围坐在炕头上，活学活用“老三篇”，用“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务作尺子，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为榜样，检查一天的思想和工作。这已成为每一个家庭毛泽东思想学习班成员的自觉行动。
    毛主席教导说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。小樵大队的领导班子认为，引导农民大学毛主席著作，最根本的就是要使农民的世界观来一个大转变：大破“私”字，大立“公”字，消除几千年来私有制度遗留在社员身上的影响，用毛泽东思想武装社员的头脑，统帅社员的行动。因此，小樵大队在办起来的社员家庭学习班里，都以活学活用“老三篇”，改造世界观，作为中心内容。
    为革命种田还是为工分种田？这是社员中公与私斗争的焦点。私有观念使一些农民把“挣工分”当作参加集体劳动的目的。小樵大队广大贫下中农家家户户带着这个问题学习“老三篇”，自觉地对“为工分种田”的思想展开批判。有一天，一位贫农老大娘对她的儿子说：“春耕到了，现在多吃点苦，多挣点工分”，用“多挣工分”督促儿子去劳动。这句话被老汉听到了，当晚便领着一家人，带着这个思想问题，学习了《纪念白求恩》这篇光辉著作。老汉对儿子说：别听你娘的话，她叫你吃小亏占大便宜，那是中国赫鲁晓夫的一套，你要听毛主席的话，毫不利己，专门利人，全心全意为人民服务。老大娘学习了毛主席著作，也做了自我批评，纠正了自己的错误思想。
      “当干部吃亏”——有的干部存在着这样的活思想。干部家庭的毛泽东思想学习班就带着这个问题，学习毛主席的教导，帮助干部破私立公。第五生产队的社员在文化大革命初期曾给队长张小明贴过几张大字报，批评他作风生硬。张小明思想上结下了疙瘩，总想当干部受累，挣工分少，还得罪人，那一头都“吃亏”，不如当个普通社员好。他这个思想一露头，就被家庭毛泽东思想学习班抓住了，一家六口带着这个问题学习“老三篇”，开斗私批修会。张小明的老伴向张小明说：“毛主席他老人家说得好：‘世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。’你可不能翻了身，忘了过去苦啊！”张小明学了“老三篇”，又得到一家人的帮助，心里亮堂了。他决心挖掉自己头脑中的“私”字，为无产阶级掌好权。他站在毛主席像前激动地说：“毛主席啊！我一定听您老人家的话，全心全意为人民服务，跟您老人家干一辈子革命。”第二天，他主动地向全队社员检查了想撂挑子的思想，勇敢地挑起了革命、生产两副重担，和社员们一起战斗在春耕生产第一线。
    小樵大队的广大贫下中农和革命干部，就是这样活学活用“老三篇”，学一句，用一句，全心全意为人民服务的思想逐步在头脑里扎下了根子。
    毛主席说：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”小樵大队贫下中农，为了把毛泽东思想真正学到手，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，以惊人的毅力，克服了种种困难，创造了许多行之有效的学习方法，使家庭毛泽东思想学习班做到：文化低难不倒，生产忙挤不倒，家务重拖不倒。
    家庭学习班遇到的第一个困难就是文化低。全大队百分之七八十的中年以上的人不识字，但是他们对毛主席和毛泽东思想有着深厚的无产阶级感情，他们说：“学习毛主席著作，只要决心大，不怕文化低。”每一个家庭学习班，都从家庭成员中推选出一名识字的人当辅导员，有的户没有人识字，就从邻居中聘请。辅导员朗读、讲解，全家人记熟、议论，并且利用一切时间来学习。清早起，妇女一面做饭、料里家务，一面温习毛主席著作；饭前饭后，一家人围桌而坐，念毛主席语录；晚上睡觉前，夫教妻，子教母，孙儿教爷爷，互教互学。每次学习内容少一点，但是学习次数多，积少成多，每个人都能记得住，讲得出，用得上。每个家庭学习班，五天开一次全家斗私批修会，狠抓思想革命化。
    农忙时学习时间少，怎么办？这个大队的家庭毛泽东思想学习班不是等到农闲时再办，而是根据农活越忙，“私”字越容易露头的情况，越是坚持办。他们的办法是：下地前，根据当天的农活和可能遇到的困难，学习毛主席几段有关的语录，休息时间，集中在地头、场边，大家一起背毛主席语录，谈心得，开讲用会；晚饭后，一家人对照最高指示，检查一天的行动。
    小樵大队的领导班子把领导社员办好家庭毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想武装社员，放在一切工作的首位。他们采取“四抓”的办法，切实帮助社员把家庭学习班办好。一抓培养骨干。大队领导班子根据不同时期的政治任务和干部、社员的活思想，经常举办干部、民兵、“红大娘”等各种不同类型的毛泽东思想学习班，在这些学习班学习过的社员，一般都成为家庭学习班的骨干。二抓学习计划。他们根据林彪副主席提出的“要把‘老三篇’作为座右铭来学”和“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的原则，强调家庭学习班要学好用好“老三篇”，搞好人的思想革命化。另外，根据无产阶级文化大革命运动的发展，每月选择几条指导当前斗争的毛主席语录，以及有关文件，印发给各个家庭学习班，使之家喻户晓，活学活用。三抓检查总结。在检查中，开展“三查、三比”活动。一查坚持天天读的情况，比事事请教毛主席，紧跟毛主席；二查对毛主席的话有没有记牢，比活学活用；三查家庭成员的学习积极性和自觉性，比坚持学习制度的情况。每检查总结一次，就提高一步。四抓辅导员工作。大队领导班子定期举办辅导员学习班，学习毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，总结辅导员的工作方法，帮助他们学会抓活思想，以便有的放矢地组织学习。大队领导班子的成员，以身作则，首先自己好好学习，抓紧改造世界观，做出样子，带动社员。
    小樵大队的贫下中农反映，大办社员家庭毛泽东思想学习班，使大队发生了十大变化：
    一，广大贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无产阶级感情更加深厚，对毛主席和毛泽东思想更加无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。
    二，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动从来没有象今天这样广泛深入，广大贫下中农改造世界观的自觉性从来没有象今天这样高涨。
    三，广大社员群众的世界观有了很大的转变。过去有些社员一事当前，常常在“私”字的圈子里打转。现在一事当前，首先想到的是集体，是国家，是革命，是“公”字当头。
    四，人人关心国家大事。过去两耳不闻天下事的六七十岁的老人，现在学习“老三篇”，斗私批修。过去眼睛里只有鼻子底下一个锅台，几只老母鸡的老大娘，现在和儿孙一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫。
    五，毛主席的革命路线深入人心，社员们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的观念大大提高，遇到错误就提出批评。
    六，社员为革命种田，干部为革命工作的精神大大发扬。过去有些社员干活拈轻怕重，计工分争多嫌少。现在社员、干部抢着干重活、干难活，谁也不计较个人报酬。
    七，过去有些社员互不关心，现在是一家有困难，全队来支援，一队有困难，全村来支援，共产主义风格大大发扬。
    八，社员家庭里过去是家长说了算，现在是用毛泽东思想来衡量和解决家庭中的一切问题，一种新型的家庭关系正在建立起来。
    九，干部作风大转变。过去干部好发号施令，有事与群众商量不够。现在干部当群众的小学生，他们带头活学活用毛主席著作，带头斗私批修，带头劳动。干部关心社员，社员爱护干部。
    十，学大寨的群众运动，正在深入地开展。
