The leading cadres of the Seventh Institute of the Fifth Ministry in Shenyang correctly treat themselves and the masses

Raise awareness of line struggle and actively stand out for the revolution

With the help of the People's Liberation Army, through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, more than 95% of the cadres have now stood out, and many have joined the revolutionary committee of the institute or the leadership groups of the departments and workshops.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 28th: The revolutionary leading cadres of the Seventh Institute of the Fifth Ministry, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the institute, and through the Mao Zedong Thought study classes jointly organized by various revolutionary mass organizations within the institute, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have raised their awareness of line struggle, corrected their attitudes towards the masses, correctly recognized themselves, and truly liberated themselves from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line and the fetters of selfishness. At present, more than 95% of the cadres in this institute have bravely stood out. Many revolutionary leading cadres have been absorbed into the revolutionary committee of the institute or the leadership groups of the basic departments and workshops. They have closely united with the revolutionary masses, seized the revolution and promoted production, and are determined to build a leadership cadre that forever holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and is highly revolutionary.

The various revolutionary mass organizations in this institute, through the joint establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, have quickly eliminated factionalism and achieved and consolidated revolutionary great unity. With the deepening development of the revolutionary situation, the broad revolutionary masses generally demand that revolutionary cadres quickly stand out to establish a three-in-one combination leadership cadre to lead the Cultural Revolution of the Seventh Institute to continue to advance. The revolutionary cadres of this institute have studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on cadre issues and deeply felt that Chairman Mao understands cadres the most and cares for cadres the most, expressing their willingness to stand out for the revolution. However, there are still many active thoughts among the cadres. Some are afraid that the masses will not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and will not let go of them; some are afraid that the masses will say they are standing out for "opportunistic" reasons and that the masses will not support them if they stand out; some even adopt an attitude of speaking less, doing less, and having less contact with the masses. The comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the institute believe that these active thoughts among the cadres are essentially a fear of the masses and a lack of trust in the masses. Cadres who do not correct their attitudes towards the masses cannot actively stand out for the revolution.

In response to this situation, the propaganda team, on the one hand, organized the cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "believing in and relying on the masses," and on the other hand, used the shining example of Chairman Mao's belief in and reliance on the masses to inspire and educate the cadres. The cadres recalled Chairman Mao's attitude towards the masses, especially when they thought of Chairman Mao's great deed of receiving the cultural revolution army of more than 11 million people eight times during the Cultural Revolution, and compared it with their own attitude towards the masses, feeling deeply that their thoughts and actions completely went against Chairman Mao's teachings, thus correcting their attitudes towards the masses and raising their courage to stand out for the revolution.

To create conditions for cadres to stand out for the revolution, the propaganda team, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching that "for cadres who make mistakes, generally speaking, the method of persuasion should be adopted to help them correct their mistakes," mobilized the masses to actively help the cadres. The broad masses actively approached the cadres, had heart-to-heart talks with them, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, and encouraged them to actively stand out. The cadres excitedly said: Chairman Mao instructs us to stand out, and the revolutionary masses support us to stand out, we have no reason not to stand out. They went to the masses to check their mistakes, seek opinions, and listen to criticism. They especially went to the departments and workshops where there were the most opinions about them, and to the masses who had been struck by them for executing the bourgeois reactionary line, humbly asking the masses who understood them to help them recognize their mistakes. The entire institute presented a new situation where cadres actively sought the help of the masses and stood out for the revolution. Deputy Director Tian Jiyun, due to his past support for one faction's unilateral seizure of power and erroneous posting of big-character posters saying that he wanted to "grasp a handful" in another faction of the masses, had many opinions from the other faction. At the beginning of entering the study class, Tian Jiyun had many concerns, fearing that the other faction would not let go of him, and had a heavy mental burden. However, the other faction of the masses not only did not hold him accountable, but also patiently helped him, had many heart-to-heart talks with him, and hoped that he would quickly stand out. The actual actions of the masses in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions deeply educated this deputy director. He excitedly said: It is not that the masses do not believe in me, but that I do not believe in the masses. After his awareness was raised, he actively went to the faction that opposed him to listen to criticism, made a self-criticism in the study class, and in the mass meeting of the entire institute, exposed his private thoughts and struggled against them, and finally gained the understanding of the masses and was elected by the revolutionary masses as the deputy director of the revolutionary committee.

After the cadres corrected their attitudes towards the masses, they actively requested to stand out, but some cadres had difficulty recognizing their mistakes at the time. Some thought that the bourgeois reactionary line was "passed down" by the "bunch" of top capitalist roaders within the party, and that they only played the role of a "small peddler"; some, although admitting their mistakes, thought that they had not fought for positions or sought fame and fortune in the past, and that their integrity was not a problem. Therefore, they felt somewhat wronged when the masses attacked them during the movement. These active thoughts show that these cadres did not see clearly the essence of the bourgeois reactionary line pushed by the top capitalist roaders within the party and had not truly hated it. To make cadres deeply recognize their mistakes, it is necessary to take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, and start from the education of the two-line struggle to raise cadres' awareness of line struggle. For this purpose, the propaganda team stationed at the institute organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and relevant discussions on class, class contradictions, and class struggle, making everyone realize that the bourgeois reactionary line pushed by Khrushchev in China is to restore capitalism in China. Then, the propaganda team organized the cadres to work with the masses to expose the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. The more they exposed, the more they saw through the essence of the bourgeois reactionary line, the more they hated the bourgeois reactionary line, and the more they saw clearly their own mistakes. A leading cadre of the Political Department said, "In the past, although I also admitted that I had executed the bourgeois reactionary line and made mistakes, I did not use the perspective of the two-line struggle to recognize my mistakes, and I did not see that the two-line struggle is a first-class major issue related to whether the country changes color or not, so I did not truly hate the bourgeois reactionary line." Now, thinking of these things, I feel that my mistakes are too serious, and I am sorry to the revolutionary masses and Chairman Mao. The cadre who originally thought that he only played the role of a "small peddler" also realized that this was not a "small peddler" at all, but consciously or unconsciously helping Khrushchev in China to peddle the black goods of restoring capitalism. The cadre who originally thought that his "integrity was not a problem" deeply felt that he had thought in the past that not fighting for fame and not seeking profit was good integrity, and this standard was too low. Raised to the height of the line struggle, with the standard of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he was not a problem of integrity, but a big problem. After the broad cadres raised their awareness of line struggle, they all expressed their determination to draw a clear line with the top capitalist roaders within the party and the bourgeois reactionary line they pushed, to completely break with their own mistakes, and to stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

To truly liberate cadres from their thoughts and build a highly revolutionary leadership cadre to hold the power of the proletariat well, the propaganda team further guided the cadres to deeply excavate the root causes of their mistakes and their incorrect attitudes towards their mistakes. The cadres seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We communists are not to be officials, but to make revolution, we must all have a thorough spirit of revolution." Chairman Mao's teachings made them realize that in the past, mistakes were made because they were alienated from the masses, nurtured officialdom, and some people, in order to protect their "official" status, could not thoroughly revolutionize and executed the bourgeois reactionary line. In the future, to be a good servant of the people, one must eliminate the "official" mentality. Only by eliminating the "official" mentality can one thoroughly break with the bourgeois reactionary line and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by eliminating the "official" mentality can one achieve ideological revolutionization and leadership cadre revolutionization, and hold the proletarian revolutionary power well. With the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, after the revolutionary committee of this institute was established, it immediately put the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works and the use of Mao Zedong Thought to guide all work and achieve the revolutionization of the leadership cadre in the first place.

    五机部沈阳七所领导干部正确对待自己正确对待群众
    提高路线斗争觉悟　积极地站出来革命
    在解放军帮助下，通过办毛泽东思想学习班，百分之九十五以上的干部已站了出来，许多人参加了所的革委会或科室、车间领导小组
    据新华社沈阳二十八日电　五机部沈阳七所的革命领导干部，在驻所解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，在所内各派革命群众组织联合举办的毛泽东思想学习班里，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，提高路线斗争的觉悟，端正对群众的态度，正确认识自己，使自己真正从资产阶级反动路线的束缚中解放出来，从“私”字的桎梏中解放出来。目前，这个所百分之九十五以上的干部都已勇敢地站了出来，许多革命领导干部被吸收参加所的革命委员会或基层科室、车间领导小组。他们同革命群众紧密团结在一起，抓革命促生产，决心建设一个永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的非常革命化的领导班子。
    这个所的各派革命群众组织，通过联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，围剿派性，很快实现和巩固了革命大联合。随着革命形势的深入发展，广大革命群众普遍要求革命干部迅速站出来，建立三结合的领导班子，领导七所的文化大革命继续前进。这个所的革命干部学习了毛主席关于干部问题的一系列最新指示，也深深体会到毛主席最了解干部，最关心干部，表示要站出来革命。但是，在干部中还有不少活思想，有的怕群众不按毛主席指示办事，揪住自己不放；有的怕群众说自己站出来是“投机取巧”，怕站出来群众不支持；有的甚至采取少说话、少管事、少接触群众的态度。驻所毛泽东思想宣传队同志认为，干部中这些活思想，实质是害怕群众，不相信群众。干部不端正对群众的态度，就不能积极站出来革命。
    针对这种情况，宣传队一方面组织干部反复学习毛主席关于“相信和依靠群众”的教导，另一方面又以毛主席最相信群众、依靠群众的光辉范例启发教育干部。干部们回忆起毛主席历来对群众的态度，特别是当他们想到在文化大革命运动中，毛主席不辞辛苦地八次接见了一千一百多万文化革命大军的伟大创举，再拿自己对群众的态度一对照，深深感到自己的思想和行动，完全违背了毛主席的教导，从而端正了对群众的态度，提高了站出来革命的勇气。
    为了给干部站出来革命创造条件，宣传队根据毛主席“对于犯错误的干部，一般地应采取说服的方法，帮助他们改正错误”的教导，发动群众积极帮助干部。广大群众主动接近干部，找干部谈心，一起学习毛主席最新指示，鼓励他们积极站出来。干部们激动地说：毛主席指示我们站出来，革命群众支持我们站出来，我们没有半点理由不站出来。他们纷纷到群众中去，检查错误，征求意见，听取批评。他们特别是到对自己意见最多的科室和车间去，到曾经被自己执行资产阶级反动路线打击过的群众中去，虚心地请了解自己的群众帮助自己认识错误，全所出现了干部主动争取群众帮助，积极站出来革命的新局面。副所长田积运，由于过去支持一派单方面夺权，并错误地贴出大字报，说要在另一派群众中抓“一小撮”，另一派群众对他意见很大。开始进学习班时，田积运顾虑重重，害怕另一派群众会不放过自己，思想负担很重。但是，另一派群众不但没有揪住他不放，而且对他进行了耐心的帮助，多次找他谈心，希望他很快站出来。群众按毛主席最新指示办事的实际行动，使这位副所长深受教育。他激动地说：不是群众不相信自己，而是自己不相信群众。认识提高之后，他主动到反对自己的一派群众中听取批评，在学习班上作检查，并在全所群众大会上亮私、斗私，最后取得了群众的谅解，被革命群众推选为革命委员会的副主任。
    干部们端正了对群众的态度之后，积极要求站出来，但是有些干部对自己的错误一时认识上不去。有的认为资产阶级反动路线是党内最大的一小撮走资派“贯”下来的，自己仅仅起了“小商贩”的作用；有的虽然承认自己犯了错误，但是又认为自己过去不闹地位，不争名利，大节没有问题。因此，对群众在运动中冲击了自己，总感到有些委屈。这些活思想说明，这些干部对党内最大的一小撮走资派所推行的资产阶级反动路线的本质看得不清，没有真正恨起来。要使干部深刻认识自己的错误，必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，从两条路线斗争教育入手，提高干部路线斗争的觉悟。为此，驻所宣传队组织大家反复学习毛主席的最新指示和有关阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的论述，使大家认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线，就是要在中国复辟资本主义。接着，宣传队又组织干部同群众一起大摆资产阶级反动路线的罪行。大家越摆对资产阶级反动路线的本质看得越透，越摆对资产阶级反动路线越恨，越摆对自己的错误看得越清。政治部一位领导干部说，过去我虽然也承认执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了错误，但是并没有用两条路线斗争的观点去认识自己的错误，看不到两条路线斗争是关系到国家变不变颜色的头等重大问题，对资产阶级反动路线也就没有真正恨起来。现在一想到这些，感到自己错误太严重，对不起革命群众，对不起毛主席。原来认为自己仅仅是起了“小商贩”作用的干部也认识到，这决不是什么“小商贩”，而是自觉、不自觉地在帮助中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖复辟资本主义的黑货。原来认为自己“大节没问题”的干部，深深感到，过去以为不争名，不争利就是大节好，这标准太低了。提到路线斗争的高度，以无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的标准来衡量，自己就不是大节没问题，而是大有问题。广大干部提高了路线斗争觉悟之后，都表示坚决同党内最大的一小撮走资派和他们所推行的资产阶级反动路线划清界线，彻底同自己的错误决裂，站到毛主席革命路线上来。
    为了真正从思想上彻底解放干部，建设一个非常革命化的领导班子，为无产阶级掌好权，宣传队又进一步引导干部深挖自己犯错误和犯了错误又不能正确对待自己的思想根子。干部们认真学习了毛主席的教导：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神”。毛主席的教导使他们认识到，过去犯错误，是因为脱离了群众，滋长了官气，有些人为了保自己的“官”，就不能彻底革命，就执行了资产阶级反动路线。今后要当好人民的勤务员，必须打掉“官”字。只有打掉“官”字，才能同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。只有打掉“官”字，才能实现思想革命化，实现领导班子革命化，掌好无产阶级的革命政权。在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，这个所革命委员会成立后，就把活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切工作，实现领导班子革命化摆在第一位。
