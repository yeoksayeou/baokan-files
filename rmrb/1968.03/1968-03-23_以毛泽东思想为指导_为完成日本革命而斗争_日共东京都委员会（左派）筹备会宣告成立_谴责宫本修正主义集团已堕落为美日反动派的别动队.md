The Preparatory Committee of the Leftist Faction of the Tokyo Committee of the Japanese Communist Party announced its establishment on March 3. The committee issued a declaration stating: "We take Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as our guiding ideology."

The declaration said: "Comrade Mao Zedong not only led the 700 million Chinese people to achieve great victory in the Chinese revolution, making socialist China an unshakable bastion of world revolution, but also, through long-term and fierce struggles, summed up the rich experiences of the struggles of the peoples of the world, defended and developed Marxism-Leninism, and raised it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

The declaration said: "Just as in the past the attitude towards Leninism was the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, now the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between true communists and false communists. Whether we arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and whether we can arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought is the key to leading the revolution to victory.

"We must strive to establish a proletarian worldview according to Mao Zedong Thought, especially to constantly transform ourselves with the thoughts of the 'Three Articles.' Without struggling against selfishness, we cannot struggle against revisionism, nor can we enable the masses to grasp Mao Zedong Thought.

"We must stand on the revolutionary traditions of the Japanese people, inherit them, develop them, and apply Mao Zedong Thought to the realities of Japan."

The declaration said: "Currently, the world is presenting a great situation. The proletariat of the world, the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, with socialist China at the forefront, are on one side, while the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union and their followers, and the reactionaries of various countries are on the other side. The fierce struggle between revolution and counter-revolution is unfolding on a global scale.

"This fierce struggle is developing in a direction that is extremely favorable to the revolutionary people and extremely unfavorable to the imperialists, that is, 'the East Wind prevails over the West Wind.'"

The declaration said: "The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has thoroughly shattered the imperialists' and their running dogs' dream of changing the color of socialist China and restoring capitalism, building socialist China into an unshakable bastion of world revolution, and opening up the path to communism. This brilliant victory has opened up a new era for the international communist movement and people's struggles, ushered in a new era of Mao Zedong Thought, made China a reliable rear base for the struggle of the Vietnamese people, given infinite courage and hope to the revolutionary people of the world, and made the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries tremble with fear."

The declaration said: "The struggle of the Japanese people is also advancing. The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, right-wing social democrats, and the Kobayashi revisionist group are raging madly to strangle the revolutionary main force, the working class, and make it suffer setbacks. Under such circumstances, the Japanese working class, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, has seen through their true colors and begun to open up a new future with their own strength."

The declaration pointed out: "The revolutionary struggles of the world are advancing, and the struggle of the Japanese people is about to enter a new phase. In this great era, the Kobayashi revisionist group has completely abandoned the principles of Marxism-Leninism, abandoned the responsibility of being the vanguard of the Japanese people, abandoned the integrity of the Communist Party, and has now shamefully degenerated into 'defenders of capitalism.'

"The Kobayashi revisionist group, in collusion with the Soviet modern revisionists who have betrayed the Chinese people, the Cuban people, the Arab people, and are now plotting to betray the Vietnamese people, is trying to strangle the revolutionary struggles of the Japanese people and the people of the world.

"The Kobayashi revisionist group spreads the illusion of peaceful revolution, advocates parliamentarism, reformism, and economism, numbs the fighting spirit of the working class, pours cold water on the fiery mass struggles, and completely plays the role of counter-revolutionaries."

The declaration said: When Japanese workers and students were fighting to the death to prevent Sato from going to Taiwan and the United States, the Kobayashi group colluded with the Sato reactionaries to insult the demonstrators as "hooligans" and attempted to divert the attention of the people. When workers and students in Sasebo were fighting a bloody battle to oppose the docking of the "Enterprise," the Kobayashi group insulted and beat the workers and students. The Kobayashi group is completely playing the role of attacking the revolutionary ranks of the Japanese people and selling them out to the enemy regime, acting as a strike force for the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

The declaration pointed out: "The Kobayashi group also opposes Mao Zedong Thought, opposes the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, incites anti-China sentiments, and in step with the efforts to revive Japanese militarism, advocates chauvinism and bourgeois nationalism."

The declaration pointed out: "The Kobayashi revisionist group is a running dog of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries who have infiltrated the people's ranks and the hearts of the working class under the name of the 'Japanese Communist Party,' playing a role that the Liberal Democratic Party, right-wing violent groups, and right-wing social democrats cannot play."

The declaration said: "We will thoroughly smash the Kobayashi revisionist group, which has degenerated into a bunch of counter-revolutionary elements, eliminate its influence, and clear the way for the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people."

The declaration said: The enemies of the Japanese people are U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries centered on Japanese comprador monopoly capitalists who depend on it, and their biggest accomplices are Soviet modern revisionism and the Kobayashi revisionist group.

The declaration said: The Japanese revolution is a continuous revolution that develops from the national democratic revolution to the socialist revolution. It needs to form a broad national democratic united front led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting the broad masses of patriotic people and patriotic personages.

The declaration said: To complete the Japanese revolution, we must adhere to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We must adhere to the principle of violent revolution, thoroughly settle accounts with the theory of peaceful revolution, parliamentarism, and legalism; at the same time, we must combine all forms of struggle, legal and illegal, open and secret, parliamentary and mass, peaceful and armed, and use them. We must turn the great thought that 'the people, and only the people, are the motive force of world history' and 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' into the thoughts of the masses.

    以毛泽东思想为指导  为完成日本革命而斗争
    日共东京都委员会（左派）筹备会宣告成立
    谴责宫本修正主义集团已堕落为美日反动派的别动队
    新华社二十二日讯　东京消息：日本共产党东京都委员会（左派）筹备会三月三日宣告成立。筹备会发表宣言说：“我们把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想作为指导思想”。
    宣言说：“毛泽东同志不仅领导七亿中国人民取得了伟大中国革命的胜利，使社会主义中国成为世界革命的永不变色的坚不可摧的堡垒，而且在长期的激烈斗争中，总结了世界人民的丰富的斗争经验，捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，并把它提高到了一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。”
    宣言说：“正象过去对列宁主义采取什么态度是区分革命和反革命的分界线一样，现在，对毛泽东思想采取什么态度就是真共产主义者还是假共产主义者的分界线。我们用不用毛泽东思想武装自己，能不能用毛泽东思想武装群众，是能不能领导革命取得胜利的关键。
    “我们要按照毛泽东思想努力树立无产阶级世界观，特别要用‘老三篇’的思想不断地改造自己。不斗私，就不会同修正主义进行斗争，也不能使群众掌握毛泽东思想。
    “我们要立足于日本人民的革命传统，继承它，发展它，把毛泽东思想运用到日本的现实中去。”
    宣言说：“目前，世界出现了一派大好形势。以社会主义中国为首的全世界革命的工人阶级、被压迫人民和被压迫民族为一方，同以美国为首的帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其追随者以及各国反动派为另一方，革命与反革命的激烈大搏斗，正在全世界范围内开展着。
      “这场激烈的大搏斗，正在朝着非常有利于革命人民方面而非常不利于帝国主义方面的方向发展，也就是‘东风压倒西风’。”
    宣言说：“伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命，彻底地打破了帝国主义及其走狗妄图使社会主义中国改变颜色从而复辟资本主义的梦想，把社会主义中国建设成永不变色的世界革命的坚强堡垒，开辟了向共产主义发展的道路。这一辉煌胜利，开创了国际共产主义运动和人民斗争的新纪元，开辟了毛泽东思想的新时代，使中国成了越南人民斗争的可靠后方，给了全世界的革命人民无限的勇气和希望，使帝国主义、现代修正主义者和反动派们胆战心惊。”
    宣言说：“日本人民的斗争也在前进。美日反动派和右翼社会民主主义者以及宫本修正主义集团，正在为绞杀革命的主力军工人阶级的斗争并使之遭受挫折而疯狂肆虐。就在这种情况下，日本工人阶级在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，识破了他们的原形，开始用自己的力量开拓新的未来。”
    宣言指出：“全世界的革命斗争在进展，日本人民的斗争正要出现新的局面。在这样一个伟大的时代里，宫本修正主义集团，完全抛弃了马克思列宁主义的原则，抛弃了对日本人民所肩负的先锋队的责任，抛弃了共产党的节操，现在已经可耻地堕落成了‘资本主义的辩护士’。
      “宫本修正主义集团，同曾经背叛了中国人民，背叛了古巴人民，背叛了阿拉伯人民，而今天又在策划背叛越南人民的苏联现代修正主义者一个鼻孔出气，企图使日本人民和世界人民的革命斗争夭折。
      “宫本修正主义集团，散布和平革命的幻想，宣扬议会主义、改良主义和经济主义，麻痹工人阶级的斗志，给热火朝天的群众斗争泼冷水，完全扮演了反革命的角色。”
    宣言说：当日本工人、学生为了阻止佐藤去台湾、美国活动而进行殊死斗争的时刻，宫本集团和佐藤反动派里应外合，辱骂示威者是“暴徒”，并妄图转移人民的注意力。当工人、学生在佐世保为反对“企业号”停泊而进行流血斗争的时刻，宫本集团却对工人和学生百般辱骂和挥舞大棒。宫本集团完全是扮演着进攻日本人民革命队伍并把它出卖给敌对政权的角色，是美日反动派的别动队。
    宣言指出：“宫本集团还反对毛泽东思想，反对中国无产阶级文化大革命，煽动反华情绪，同加紧复活日本军国主义的步调相配合，鼓吹沙文主义和资产阶级民族主义。”
    宣言指出：宫本修正主义集团“是在以‘日本共产党’的名字作为政治资本、混进人民的队伍、潜入工人阶级的心脏的美日反动派的走狗，它起着自由民主党、右翼暴力团、右翼社会民主主义者所不能起到的作用。”
    宣言说：“我们将彻底粉碎已经堕落为一伙反革命党徒的宫本修正主义集团，消除其影响，扫清日本人民革命斗争前进的道路。”
    宣言说：日本人民的敌人，是美帝国主义和依附于它的以日本卖国垄断资本为核心的反动派，它们的最大帮凶，是苏联现代修正主义和宫本修正主义集团。
    宣言说，日本革命，是由民族民主革命向社会主义革命发展的两个阶段的连续革命。它需要组成以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础、团结广大爱国人民和爱国人士的广泛的民族民主统一战线。
    宣言说：为了完成日本革命，就要坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。坚持暴力革命的原则，彻底清算和平革命论、议会主义、合法主义；同时，把合法与非法、公开与秘密、议会的与群众的、和平的与武力的所有斗争形式结合起来，加以运用。一定要把“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”，“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大思想变成人民群众的思想。
