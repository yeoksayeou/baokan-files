At dawn on January 31, the sound of guns firing at the enemy echoed through the air. The brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who were fully prepared on the Fourth Highway, immediately split into multiple units, like sharp swords piercing the heart of Mỹ Tho's provincial capital. They launched a storm-like attack on the enemy's 32nd Special Forces Camp, the command center of the puppet 7th Division, and other puppet military and government agencies.

Faced with the fierce assault of the military and people of Mỹ Tho, the enemy leaders were in a state of panic and fled in disarray. Among the fleeing enemy leaders was the puppet president, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. A so-called "seaborne assault unit" of the U.S.-puppet forces, fearing annihilation, disintegrated and collapsed.

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Mỹ Tho Province fought fiercely, destroying the enemy's strongholds, while calling on the puppet soldiers to surrender. At the puppet Provincial Security Brigade headquarters, after just fifteen minutes of battle, the Liberation Army thoroughly annihilated the enemy's command group that was putting up stubborn resistance.

Other puppet security personnel hastily boarded two military vehicles, raised white flags, and surrendered to the people's liberation forces; many puppet policemen also laid down their weapons and surrendered to the Liberation Army in droves.

After several hours of intense fighting, the people's liberation forces occupied the central area of Mỹ Tho's provincial capital, annihilated most of two puppet battalions and the puppet Provincial Security Brigade headquarters, and destroyed the enemy's radio station and "re-education center." With the enthusiastic help of local residents, the liberation forces quickly fortified the streets and set up anti-aircraft positions on various buildings. They also shot down three enemy helicopters and one I-13 reconnaissance plane that were operating in the city's airspace. Other units of the liberation forces, with the assistance of the people of Mỹ Tho, attacked and occupied the puppet 7th Division command center, the puppet governor's residence, the living quarters of American aggressors and their mercenaries, and two ammunition depots, completely controlling the city center.

However, the enemy, unwilling to admit defeat, rallied several battalions of puppet forces and armored units for a desperate counterattack. The liberation forces, who had been waiting in readiness, immediately struck back fiercely, bravely annihilating the enemy.

The various units of the Liberation Army converged, and shouts of joy echoed through the skies, shaking the mountains and rivers. The flags of the National Liberation Front flew high atop the puppet governor's residence, the Buddhist temple, and other places in the city.

At 3 PM on February 1, the U.S.-puppet forces mobilized all the troops from the Phu Loi U.S. military base, attempting to rescue the enemy forces inside the city who had been defeated. Two battalions of U.S. troops and one battalion of puppet forces secretly landed east of Mỹ Tho City, attempting to infiltrate the city. With the close cooperation of the masses, the liberation forces continuously repelled nine enemy attacks, annihilating hundreds of enemy soldiers.

In this way, from 2:55 AM on January 31 to 5 PM on February 1, the military and people of Mỹ Tho Province completely controlled the central area of the provincial capital. They annihilated over 1,200 U.S.-puppet soldiers, destroyed numerous enemy armored vehicles and military trucks, shot down eight enemy aircraft, and seized over 1,000 guns.

    美萩城内歼灭战
    一月三十一日凌晨，向敌人发动进攻的枪声打响了。
    第四号公路上整装待发的解放军勇士们立即分成多路，象一把把利剑直插美萩省会中心，向敌人第三十二别动营、伪军第七师指挥部等伪军和伪政权机关展开暴风雨般的进攻。在美萩省军民极其猛烈的进攻面前，美伪军头目惊惶失措，狼狈逃窜。在逃走的敌军头目中，还有傀儡总统阮文绍。一个美伪军的所谓“海上冲锋团”，害怕被歼，自动瓦解，溃不成军。
    美萩省解放军战士一边猛冲猛打，摧毁敌人顽固的巢穴，一边号召伪军官兵投降。在伪省保安团部那里，仅仅经过十五分钟的战斗，解放军就干净彻底地消灭了顽抗的敌人指挥集团。
    其他伪保安队员慌忙跳上两辆军车，张起白旗，投向人民解放武装力量；许多伪警察也放下武器，纷纷向解放军投降。
    经过几小时激战，人民解放武装力量就占领了美萩省会的中心区，消灭了伪军两个连的大部和伪省保安团部，并摧毁了敌人广播电台和“反省厅”。在市内居民的热情帮助下，人民解放武装力量迅速修筑街道工事，在各座大楼上设置防空点，并击落敌人在市区上空活动的直升飞机三架、Ⅰ—13侦察机一架。解放武装力量的其他单位在美萩市人民群众的协助下，攻打和占领了伪军第七师指挥部、伪省长官邸、美国强盗及其雇佣军的住所、军械库两座，完全控制了市中心。
    但是，敌人不甘失败，纠集数营伪军和装甲部队进行疯狂反扑。早已严阵以待的解放武装力量立即予以迎头痛击，勇歼犯敌。
    各路解放军会师了，欢呼声响彻云霄，震荡着山河大地。民族解放阵线旗帜在美萩省伪省长官邸顶上、在佛印庙顶上和市内其他地方高高飘扬。
    二月一日下午三时，美伪军又出动了平德美军基地的所有军队，妄想前来解救市内被打得一败涂地的敌人。两个营的美军和一个营的伪军偷偷在美萩市的东面登陆，妄图向市内窜犯。解放武装力量在广大人民密切配合协作下，接连粉碎敌人九次进攻，歼灭成百敌人。
    就这样，从一月三十一日凌晨两点五十五分到二月一日十七点的两天内，美萩省军民完全控制了省会中心区，歼灭美伪军一千二百多名，摧毁敌装甲车和军车多辆，击落敌机八架，缴获各种枪枝一千支。
