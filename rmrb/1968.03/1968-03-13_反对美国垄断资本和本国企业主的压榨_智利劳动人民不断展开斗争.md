	Chilean workers and agricultural workers have recently been continuously fighting against the exploitation by U.S. monopolies and local bosses.

	Workers at various power plants in Chile, controlled by U.S. monopolies, have been on partial strikes since the 7th, demanding wage increases and protesting against the cruel exploitation of Chilean workers by American bosses.

	In the northern Chilean city of Antofagasta, 1,400 construction workers have been on strike since last week, demanding wage increases.

	Eight hundred workers at the Melon Cement Factory went on a 24-hour strike on the 6th, protesting against the factory owner's unjust layoffs of workers.

	Due to the intensified plunder by U.S. monopolies, the living conditions of the broad masses of Chilean workers are deteriorating day by day. Recently, the International Monetary Fund, controlled by the U.S., imposed a policy on Chile to restrict wage increases for workers, facilitating American capital's exploitation of Chilean workers. This has sparked strong opposition from Chilean workers.

　　智利劳动人民不断展开斗争
    据新华社讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利工人和农业工人最近不断展开斗争，反对美国垄断资本和本国企业主的压榨。
    美国垄断资本控制的智利各家发电厂的工人，从七日起举行各工段的部分罢工，要求增加工资，抗议美国老板对智利工人的残酷剥削。
    在智利北部的安托法加斯塔城，一千四百名建筑工人从上周起举行罢工，要求增加工资。
    梅隆水泥厂的八百名工人在六日举行二十四小时罢工，反对厂主无理解雇工人。
    由于美国垄断资本加紧对智利的掠夺，智利广大劳动人民的生活条件日益恶化。最近，美国控制的国际货币基金组织为了便于美国资本对智利工人的剥削，把一项限制提高工人工资的政策强加于智利，引起智利工人的强烈反对。
