	Collectivization is the Happy Path for the Poor and Lower-Middle Class Peasants of the Miao Ethnic Group

	The Chinese Khrushchev and the other major capitalist-roader within the Party are wolves in human skin, the chief culprits of the black wind of individual farming. They sing in unison, frantically advocating individual farming. One says: "In industry, we must retreat sufficiently, and in agriculture, we must also retreat sufficiently, including the responsibility system to the household and individual farming"; the other shouts: "A considerable number of peasants demand the distribution of land," "Peasants have lost confidence in the collective economy." This is the most vicious attack and slander against the five hundred million peasants!

	We Miao poor and lower-middle class peasants deeply understand from the cruel class oppression and exploitation of the old society that individual production means poverty and bitterness, and individual farming is a dead end! Before liberation, the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries raided villages and burned settlements, committing all sorts of atrocities; the "headmen," "Dao gongs," and local bullies, these den of vipers and local tyrants, also ruthlessly forced us into slavery. The Miao poor and lower-middle class peasants have suffered and struggled in the eighteen layers of hell for thousands of years! The Chinese Khrushchev and the other major capitalist-roader within the Party advocate individual farming, which is actually to make us regress back to the old society. What a deep and heavy disaster that would be!

	The red sun rises over the Miao mountains, and Chairman Mao leads us Miao poor and lower-middle class peasants to turn over a new leaf. We divided the land, determined to change the poor and drought-stricken face of the Miao mountains. However, "Individual farming is like grass on the wall, shallow roots and thin stalks, blown by the wind"; "Small peasant economy is weak, facing disasters can only eat wild fruits!" In the early years of liberation, there were droughts every year, and the individual farming Miao people could only watch the river water flow by below the mountain and the crops wither in the fields. The Miao villages quickly showed signs of polarization again. The newly liberated slaves had to borrow money and sell land, work as temporary laborers, or go up the mountain to pick wild fruits to survive the hard times, while the wealthy families took the opportunity to lend money and hire labor to exploit. Seeing this situation, the old poor peasants thought of the bitter past and were extremely anxious and restless! Just at this time, the great leader Chairman Mao called on us to organize and "implement collectivization, eliminate the rich peasant economy and individual economy in the countryside, and make all rural people prosperous together."

	Chairman Mao is truly the closest and dearest person to our Miao poor and lower-middle class peasants! He spoke our hearts. Everyone said: Chairman Mao's call is a beacon, we are determined to promote collectivization, unshakable by thunder and fire, unblinking even if the sky falls, and we will not let the poor and drought-stricken old Miao mountains be built into a new socialist Miao mountains, and we will not let Chairman Mao down.

	For more than a decade, we have done what we said. No matter how the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements stirred up trouble and spread rumors to sabotage, no matter how the major capitalist-roaders within the Party sabotaged and obstructed, slandered and attacked, we Miao poor and lower-middle class peasants have remained steadfast on the path of collectivization, unyielding in our resolve and unwavering in our loyalty! In 1962, when the Chinese Khrushchev and the other major capitalist-roader within the Party frantically advocated individual farming, we Miao poor and lower-middle class peasants, following Chairman Mao's teachings, focused on class struggle and conducted extensive class education. In every brigade and production team, every small village and large commune, we carried out activities to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, comparing two societies, two systems, and two paths. Everyone exposed the tricks and plots of the class enemies in spreading the black wind of individual farming, defeated the spontaneous capitalist forces, and consolidated and developed the collective economy. The other major capitalist-roader within the Party spread rumors saying: "A considerable number of peasants demand the distribution of land," "Peasants have lost confidence in the collective economy." This is extremely reactionary. Who demands the distribution of land? Who has lost confidence in the collective economy and harbors resentment? In our Miao mountains, only the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. Whom is the other major capitalist-roader within the Party speaking for? Isn't it clear?

	We Miao poor and lower-middle class peasants have only one demand, that is, to follow the great leader Chairman Mao in revolution forever, and to firmly walk the socialist path! The path of collectivization is the broad and smooth road to collective prosperity. Ironclad facts are the best proof. Collectivization and communalization have brought about earth-shaking changes in the Miao villages. Relying on the mighty power of the collective economy and with our hundredfold confidence and courage in socialism, we have opened up wastelands, built water conservancy projects, and constructed a six-li-long dam on the mid-mountain slope. The thousand-year-old drought-stricken Miao mountains are now crisscrossed with irrigation networks, steep slopes have been transformed into terraced fields, dry lands into paddy fields, barren mountains into fertile fields, and rice production has been bountiful year after year. The once poor and barren mountains and grain-deficient villages have become granaries. With water, we built power stations, and the Miao people began to use electric lights. The era of using pine torches and cypress bark for lighting has passed. Electric rice hullers, flour mills, noodle presses, and cotton gins have replaced heavy manual labor, liberated women's labor, strengthened the agricultural frontline, and further promoted agricultural production.

	The times have changed, and more importantly, people's spiritual outlook has undergone a great transformation. Studying Chairman Mao's works has promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking. The old customs have been swept away, and superstitious activities like seeking gods and driving away ghosts are no longer practiced. In the once "blind villages" and "wild communes," cultural rooms and primary schools have been built everywhere, and everywhere has become a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. The former "muddy Miao people" have now become dedicated good cadres and community members, active learners of Chairman Mao's works, honorable people's representatives, and pioneers of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many have even gone to Beijing and seen the great leader Chairman Mao. Look! What a great honor, what a great change! All honors go to the great leader Chairman Mao! All changes are thanks to listening to Chairman Mao's words and to communalization! Comparing the past with the present, the Miao poor and lower-middle class peasants all enthusiastically shout from the bottom of their hearts: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the people's commune! The community members are determined to carry the socialist revolution through to the end! The other major capitalist-roader within the Party slanders us, saying that we have "lost confidence in the collective economy" and that our "enthusiasm has been destroyed." Isn't this precisely a revelation of his wild ambition to sabotage the collective economy and restore capitalism?

	Chairman Mao said: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward-moving wheels of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly be victorious." Whether it is the American imperialists or the Soviet revisionists, whether it is the Chinese Khrushchev or the other major capitalist-roader within the Party, they attempt to block the rolling wheels of history, but they are merely blocking a cart with their arms, seeking self-destruction! We Miao poor and lower-middle class peasants resolutely walk the path of collectivization, all the way to the brilliant communist paradise. Let the Chinese Khrushchev and the other major capitalist-roader within the Party be crushed under the rolling wheels of history!

    集体化是苗族贫下中农的幸福路
    海军某部苗族五好战士　杨盛旺
    中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派是披着人皮的豺狼，大刮单干黑风的罪魁祸首。他们一唱一和，拚命鼓吹单干。一个说：“工业上要退够，农业上也要退够，包括包产到户，单干”；一个叫嚷：“相当多的农民要求分配土地”，“农民对集体经济丧失了信心”。这是对五亿农民最恶毒的攻击和污蔑！
    我们苗族贫下中农从旧社会的残酷的阶级压迫和阶级剥削中深深懂得：个体生产就是穷和苦，单干就是死路一条！解放前，日本侵略者和国民党反动派抄村烧寨，奸淫掠夺，无恶不作；“头人”、“道公”、恶霸这窝地头蛇、土皇帝，也穷凶极恶地逼我们当奴隶。苗家贫下中农在十八层地狱里熬煎、挣扎了几千年！中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派鼓吹单干，实际上就是要我们重新倒退到旧社会去。那是多深多重的灾难啊！
    红日东升苗山亮，毛主席领导我们苗家贫下中农把身翻。我们分了田地，一心想改变一穷二旱的苗山面貌。可是，“单干好比墙头草，根浅苗细随风倒”，“小农经济力单薄，有灾只能吃野果！”解放初期，年年干旱，单干的苗民眼巴巴地看着山下的河水白流，地里的禾苗枯死。苗家山寨很快又出现了两极分化，刚翻身的奴隶有的借债卖地，有的给人打短工，有的上山摘野果度荒，而富裕人家又乘机放债、雇工搞剥削。眼看这种情景，老贫农们联想到苦难的过去，真是焦虑万分，坐立不安啊！正在这个时候，伟大的领袖毛主席号召我们组织起来，“实行合作化，在农村中消灭富农经济制度和个体经济制度，使全体农村人民共同富裕起来”。
    毛主席真是我们苗族贫下中农最亲最亲的贴心人啊！他老人家说出了我们的心里话。大家都说：毛主席号召是灯塔，我们一心搞集体化，雷打火烧不动摇，天塌下来眼不眨，不把一穷二旱的旧苗山建设成社会主义的新苗山，就对不起毛主席他老人家。
    十几年来，我们说到做到。不管地富反坏怎样煽风点火，造谣破坏，不管党内最大的一小撮走资派怎样破坏阻挠，污蔑攻击，我们苗族贫下中农走集体化道路，始终大志不移，红心不变，在同阶级敌人作不调和的斗争中，我们最坚定最顽强！一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派拚命鼓吹单干的时候，我们苗家贫下中农却按照毛主席的教导，大抓阶级斗争，大搞阶级教育。小队大队，小村大寨，普遍开展了两个社会、两种制度、两条道路的忆苦思甜活动。大家戳穿了阶级敌人刮单干黑风的阴谋诡计，击败了资本主义自发势力，巩固和发展了集体经济。党内另一个最大的走资派造谣说：“相当多的农民要求分配土地”，“农民对集体经济丧失了信心”。真是反动透顶。谁要求分配土地？谁对集体经济丧失信心并且怀恨在心？在我们苗山只有地富反坏分子。党内另一个最大的走资派到底在替谁说话，不是昭然若揭吗？
    我们苗族贫下中农只有一个要求，那就是永生永世跟着伟大领袖毛主席闹革命，坚定不移地走社会主义道路！集体化道路是走向集体富裕的康庄大道。铁的事实就是最好的说明。集体化、公社化，苗家山寨发生了天翻地覆的大变化。依靠集体经济的强大威力，凭着我们对社会主义的百倍信心和勇气，我们大队开荒除灾修水利，半山腰筑起六里多长的大水坝，千年干旱的苗山已到处是自流化的排灌网，陡坡变梯田，旱地变水田，荒山变良田，水稻生产年年丰收，几千年的穷山寨、缺粮村变成了富足的米粮仓。有了水又建发电站，苗家开始用上电灯，靠松明子、杉木皮照明的时代一去不复返了。电动的碾米机、磨粉机、压面机、轧花机，代替了笨重的体力劳动，解放了妇女劳动力，加强了农业第一线，进一步推动了农业生产。
    天变地变，更重要的是人的精神面貌大改变。大学毛主席著作，推动了人的思想革命化。破除四旧，求神打鬼的迷信活动再也没人愿搞了。几千年的“盲村”、“野寨”，到处建起文化室、小学校，到处成了活学活用毛主席著作的课堂和斗私批修的战场。过去当牛做马的“土苗子”，今天当上了一心为公的好干部、好社员，当上了学习毛主席著作的积极分子，当上了光荣的人民代表，成了无产阶级文化大革命的闯将，不少人还上北京见到了伟大的领袖毛主席。看！这是多么高的荣誉，多么大的变化啊！千荣誉万荣誉，荣誉归于伟大领袖毛主席！千变化万变化，变化全靠听毛主席的话，全靠人民公社化！忆昔比今，苗族贫下中农都从心底里激动地高呼：毛主席万岁！人民公社万岁！社员们决心把社会主义革命进行到底！党内另一个最大的走资派污蔑我们“对集体经济丧失了信心”，“积极性破坏了”，这不正好是他妄图破坏集体经济、复辟资本主义的狼子野心的一次大暴露吗？
    毛主席说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”不管是美帝还是苏修，不管是中国的赫鲁晓夫还是党内另一个最大的走资派，他们妄图阻挡滚滚向前的历史车轮，只不过是螳臂当车，自取灭亡！我们苗族贫下中农坚决走集体化道路，一直走到光辉灿烂的共产主义天堂。让中国赫鲁晓夫及党内另一个最大的走资派在滚滚向前的历史车轮下面碾个粉碎吧！
