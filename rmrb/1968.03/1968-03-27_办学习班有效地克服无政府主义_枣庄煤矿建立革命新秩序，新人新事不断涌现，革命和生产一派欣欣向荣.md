The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Zaozhuang Coal Mine in Shandong, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mine, have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. These classes have effectively overcome the anarchist tendencies among some miners, ensuring that the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions are better implemented. As a result, the mine is experiencing a flourishing scene of revolution and production.

Zaozhuang Coal Mine is the largest coal mine in the Zaozhuang mining area, with over 7,000 employees. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the mine's proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers made significant contributions. However, due to the influence of anarchist tendencies, some workers exhibited free and easy attitudes and lax labor discipline. The mine's revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's directive to "hold study classes, which is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," mobilized the masses to organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes. These classes helped revolutionary workers further recognize the harm of anarchism and strive for new achievements in both revolution and production.

The revolutionary committee understood that to help some workers overcome reactionary anarchist tendencies, the key was for the leadership to take the initiative.

They first organized a study class attended by over 100 members of the revolutionary committee and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations. Through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles" (Old Three Articles), as well as intensifying class education, everyone's ideological awareness was significantly raised. They deeply understood that anarchism, like bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, is a venomous snake that poisons the revolutionary ranks. Wherever anarchist tendencies spread, unity disintegrates, discipline relaxes, Chairman Mao's latest instructions cannot be fully implemented, and the dictatorship of the proletariat is difficult to consolidate. Proletarian revolutionaries must strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline and overcome reactionary anarchism.

After the revolutionary committee members and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations raised their awareness, they organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The majority of revolutionary miners and their families participated in the study. Some workers who dared to revolutionize during the Cultural Revolution examined their shortcomings of considering themselves heroes and not paying attention to observing revolutionary discipline in the study classes. Some workers who were previously misled and stood on the wrong side also realized that they had stood on the wrong side in the past and should now strive for new achievements in both revolution and production. Through self-examination and criticism, the entire mine's cadres, workers, and their families generally raised their class consciousness. They said: Anarchism is a corrosive agent in our revolutionary ranks. If we do not resolutely resist anarchism, it will be used by class enemies, and the revolutionary cause will suffer losses.

Currently, Zaozhuang Coal Mine has established a new revolutionary order, with new people, new events, and new customs continuously emerging. The enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works has generally increased, and production has also changed significantly. Based on completing the February coal production task four days ahead of schedule, the mine's daily production in March is gradually increasing.

In Jiangsu Province, Taicang County, Shaqiu Commune, Hongjing Brigade's poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres follow the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions, organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    办学习班有效地克服无政府主义
    枣庄煤矿建立革命新秩序，新人新事不断涌现，革命和生产一派欣欣向荣
    新华社济南电　山东枣庄矿务局枣庄煤矿的无产阶级革命派，在解放军驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，有效地克服了一些矿工中的无政府主义思潮，使伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示更好地得到落实，全矿革命、生产出现一派欣欣向荣的新气象。
    枣庄煤矿是枣庄矿区最大的一个煤矿，拥有七千多名职工。这个矿的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中作出了不少的贡献。但是，由于无政府主义思潮的影响，在一部分职工中出现了自由散漫，劳动纪律松弛的现象。矿革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导，放手发动群众，大办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助革命职工进一步认清无政府主义的危害，在抓革命、促生产中立新功。
    矿革命委员会认识到，要帮助一部分职工克服反动的无政府主义思潮，关键在于领导带头。
    他们首先举办了一个由矿革委会委员、革命群众组织负责人共一百多人参加的毛泽东思想学习班。通过学习毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”以及狠抓阶级教育，大家的思想觉悟有了很大提高，深刻地认识到无政府主义和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性一样，是缠人的大毒蛇，凡是无政府主义思潮泛滥的地方，团结就涣散，纪律就松弛，毛主席的最新指示就不能得到全面落实，无产阶级专政就很难巩固。无产阶级革命派，一定要加强革命的组织纪律性，克服反动的无政府主义。
    革命委员会成员和革命群众组织负责人的认识提高后，纷纷办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，广大革命矿工和矿工家属普遍参加了学习。一些在文化大革命中敢于革命的职工，在学习班上检查了自己以功臣自居，不注意遵守革命纪律的缺点；一些过去受过蒙蔽站错过队的职工也认识到，过去站错了队，现在更应当在抓革命、促生产中立新功。通过亮私斗私，全矿干部、职工和家属普遍提高了阶级觉悟。他们说：无政府主义是我们革命队伍的腐蚀剂，如果对无政府主义不进行坚决的抵制，就会被阶级敌人所利用，革命事业就要受到损失。
    现在，枣庄煤矿已经建立起革命的新秩序，革命的新人、新事、新风尚不断涌现。全矿学习毛主席著作的风气普遍增强，生产也发生了很大变化。全矿在提前四天完成二月份产煤任务的基础上，三月份日产量正逐渐上升。
    江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队贫下中农和革命干部遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。　新华社稿（传真照片）
