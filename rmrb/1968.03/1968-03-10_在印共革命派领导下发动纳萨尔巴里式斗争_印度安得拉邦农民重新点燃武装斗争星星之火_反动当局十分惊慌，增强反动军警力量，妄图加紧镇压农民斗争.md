The peasants of Andhra Pradesh, India, who have a glorious tradition of armed revolutionary struggle, have recently, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Faction of the Communist Party of India, reignited the spark of armed revolutionary struggle, causing the Indian reactionary government to panic.

According to the *Indian Express*, in the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh and some areas bordering Orissa and Madhya Pradesh, revolutionary peasants have begun to launch Naxalbari-style struggles. Reports indicate that in these areas, "the secret manufacture of 'rough muzzle-loading guns' is increasing at an alarming rate. This situation has caused officials to be uneasy."

This bourgeois newspaper revealed that the tribal people in the Srikakulam mountainous region possess thousands of guns. Over the past two months, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Faction of the Communist Party of India, they have taken several violent actions. They are also busy manufacturing bows and arrows as weapons to resist the reactionaries' armed suppression. In the Parvathipuram area of Srikakulam district, the tribal people have launched several armed raids since February 1st.

The Chief Minister of the reactionary government of Andhra Pradesh, on the 4th, nervously shouted in the state assembly for the intensified suppression of the revolutionary peasants' struggle, declaring that the state government would allocate a large sum of money to strengthen the reactionary military and police forces.

The Chief Minister of Orissa, on the same day, admitted in the state assembly that in Koraput and Ganjam districts bordering Andhra Pradesh, there have been peasant struggles to seize forest land by force. He shouted that the Orissa state government would jointly suppress the struggle with the Andhra Pradesh government.

    据新华社讯　新德里消息：有着光荣的革命武装斗争传统的印度安得拉邦农民，最近在印度共产党革命派的领导下，重新点燃革命武装斗争的星星之火，使印度反动政府十分惊慌。
    据《印度斯坦时报》透露，在安得拉邦的斯里卡库兰县和这个邦同奥里萨邦和中央邦接界的一些地区，革命农民已经开始发动纳萨尔巴里式的斗争。据报道，在这些地区，“秘密地制造‘粗糙的前膛枪’的事例正在惊人地增加。这种情况已经引起官员们不安”。
    这家资产阶级报纸透露，斯里卡库兰山区的部族人民拥有上千支枪。过去两个月中，在印共革命派的领导下，他们采取了好几次暴力行动。他们还在加紧制造弓箭，作为对抗反动派进行武装镇压的武器。在斯里卡库兰县的帕尔瓦蒂普兰地区，部族人民从二月一日以来发动了几次武装突袭。
    安得拉邦反动政府的首席部长四日在邦议会上惊慌不安地叫嚷要加紧镇压革命农民的斗争，宣称邦政府将拨出一大笔款项来增强反动军警的力量。
    奥里萨邦的首席部长同一天在邦议会中承认，在同安得拉邦接界的科拉普特县和干查姆县发生了农民用暴力夺回森林土地的斗争。他叫嚷说，奥里萨邦政府将同安得拉邦政府合伙进行镇压。
