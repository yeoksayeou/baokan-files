In the midst of celebrating the imminent victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the boiler team at the Fengcheng Mine of the Chemical Industry Ministry successfully completed a comprehensive boiler modification experiment, primarily replacing water with steam. The average daily coal consumption was reduced from eight tons to 2.4 tons, eliminating the need for one boiler and two furnaces, and saving three boiler operators. Just from the two months of November and December last year, when the modifications were put into production, the nation saved 167 tons of raw coal.

This good news spread throughout Liaoning Province, and revolutionary masses who came to visit and learn enthusiastically exclaimed, "This is another victory for the great thought of Mao Zedong!"

The Fengcheng Mine previously had two boilers, one vertical and one horizontal, covering a total heating area of 3,700 square meters. Previously, the boilers operated around the clock in three shifts, with one boiler operator per shift per boiler. Every two minutes, three shovelfuls of coal had to be thrown in, with the minimum daily coal consumption being eight tons. Workers often referred to these two boilers as "coal tigers." Due to the frenzied promotion of the revisionist line by Khrushchev in China, the revolutionary spirit of the boiler operators was suppressed, and the boilers remained unmodified, wasting a large amount of national wealth.

Mao Zedong, personally initiating and leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, illuminated the hearts of the boiler workers. When Chairman Mao issued the great call to "make savings a revolution," the workers were overjoyed and full of fighting spirit. They quickly formulated a plan for the comprehensive modification of the boilers and received strong support from the PLA propaganda team stationed at the mine, revolutionary cadre leaders, and workers from other departments. The workers in this team demonstrated the fearless revolutionary spirit of the working class, working tirelessly for over seventy days, overcoming numerous difficulties, and finally achieving the comprehensive modification of the boilers in eight projects.

　　驯服“煤老虎”　节约闹革命
    化工部凤城矿改造锅炉大量节煤
    本报讯　在迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，化工部凤城矿锅炉小组进行以汽代水为主体的锅炉总体改造试验成功，平均日耗煤量由原来的八吨降到二点四吨，取消了一个锅炉和两个火炉，节省了三个司炉工人。仅从投入生产的去年十一、十二两个月计算，就为国家节约了一百六十七吨原煤。
    这一喜讯传遍了辽宁省各地，来这里参观学习的革命群众热烈欢呼：“这是伟大的毛泽东思想的又一胜利！”
    凤城矿过去共有立式、卧式两台锅炉，总取暖面积为三千七百平方米。过去昼夜三班，每台每班一个司炉，每两分钟就得用大锹扔进三锹煤，日耗煤量最低八吨。工人们常称这两台锅炉是“煤老虎”。由于中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂推行反革命修正主义路线，束缚了锅炉工人的革命精神，锅炉一直得不到改造，浪费了国家的大量财富。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，映红了锅炉工人的心。当毛主席发出“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召时，工人们个个欢欣鼓舞、斗志昂扬，很快订出了进行锅炉总体改造的计划，并得到了解放军驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队和革命领导干部及其他部门工人的大力支持。这个组的工人发扬了工人阶级大无畏的革命精神，连续奋战七十多天，克服了种种困难，终于实现了八个项目的锅炉总体改造。
