	Never Leave Chairman Mao's Teachings
	Representative of the Chemical Defense Troops' Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works Conference  Tian Fuxiang

	Day and night, I have been thinking and longing for this moment, the most happy, most glorious, and most unforgettable moment of my life. On March 7th, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received us. I was so moved that tears of happiness welled up in my eyes. There were so many heartfelt words I wanted to say, so many passionate songs I wanted to sing. All I knew was to raise my arms and shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Ten thousand years!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Studying and applying your brilliant works is the fundamental way for us to revolutionize our thinking. With this foundation, we are invincible.

	In 1963, after I became a chemical defense soldier, the first problem I encountered was the discomfort of wearing protective gear. After wearing the full-body protective gear for a short time, I would feel dizzy, nauseous, and vomit. I thought, how could I protect Chairman Mao like this? How could I protect Mao Zedong Thought? Thinking of protecting Chairman Mao, I made up my mind to train hard. Every morning, I would get up an hour earlier, carrying stones to climb mountains and run. Once, I had a high fever and couldn't eat, thinking of stopping for a while, but thinking of protecting Chairman Mao, I continued to train. Along the way, I fainted, but when I came to, I silently recited, "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and finally successfully climbed to the top of a mountain. Under the great encouragement of Mao Zedong Thought, after a period of hard training, I overcame the weakness of not adapting to wearing protective gear.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Over the years, I have deeply felt that to become a truly conscious revolutionary soldier, one must use your brilliant thoughts as a weapon, criticize and repudiate revisionism, constantly reform oneself, and never leave your affectionate teachings.

    一步不离毛主席的教导
    防化学兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表  田福祥
    天天想，夜夜盼，我一生中最最幸福、最最光荣、最最难忘的激动人心的时刻终于来到了。三月七日，世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳、我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见了我们。我激动得幸福的泪水夺眶而出，多少贴心的话不知从那里讲起，多少热情的歌不知从那里唱。我只知道振臂高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！活学活用您的光辉著作，是我们思想革命化的根本。有了这个根本，我们就无往而不胜。
    一九六三年我当了防化学兵后，碰到的第一个问题，就是穿防护器材不适应。穿上全身防护器材，不长时间，就头晕、恶心、呕吐。我想，这样怎能保卫毛主席？怎能保卫毛泽东思想？想到保卫毛主席，我就下定决心，刻苦锻炼。每天早上提前起床一个多小时，背上石头爬山、跑步。一次发高烧，吃不下饭，本想停一停，但想到保卫毛主席，就继续坚持锻炼。途中昏倒了，苏醒过来，我默默念着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，终于胜利地爬上了一个山头。在毛泽东思想的巨大鼓舞下，经过一段时间的苦练，我克服了不适应穿防护器材的这个弱点。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！几年来，我深深体会到，要使自己成为一个真正自觉的革命战士，必须以您的光辉思想为武器，斗私批修，不断改造自己，一步不离您的亲切教导。
