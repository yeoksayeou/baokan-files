It was the dead of winter, with snow falling everywhere. The Second Company of a certain engineering unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived at a mountain over three thousand meters high to undertake road construction.

January is the coldest month in the mountains. The trees on the mountain were all covered with a thick layer of ice, making them heavy and unable to stand straight. The snow-capped peaks were like drawn silver swords piercing the clouds. The high altitude and strong winds, accompanied by ice and snow, whipped up thick clouds of snow mist, making it impossible to open one's eyes. The accumulated snow rolling down the mountain turned a winding mountain path into a hard, icy road. The Second Company's task was to build a road here, opening a path for the troops.

The task was extremely arduous. However, no matter how great the difficulties, they could not stop the engineering soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Under the leadership of the party branch, the entire company launched a campaign to study "Yugong Moves Mountains." Comrades expressed their determination to fight against the wind and snow on the plateau and become "Red Yugong" in the Mao Zedong era. The soldiers said: On the battlefield in Korea, the volunteers climbed over ice and snow, facing the ferocious American imperialists, and built roads leading to victory. Today, to protect Chairman Mao and to build for the world revolution, this bit of wind and snow is nothing! When it's cold, we have the sun in our hearts, which can melt the ice and snow for a thousand miles; when the ground is hard, we have the four volumes of the precious book in our hands, which can build roads to the sky.

Construction began. Red signs with Chairman Mao's quotations were erected on the construction site, reading: "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." These were the red lanterns in the soldiers' hearts, the guiding stars for the engineering soldiers! They loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations, swung their pickaxes, and hacked through the mountains to open roads. The ground was frozen as hard as iron, and every swing of the pickaxe made their arms numb, leaving only a white mark. What to do? If they continued like this, the construction would progress slowly and delay the schedule. The soldiers immediately held a "Zhuge Liang" meeting, where everyone brainstormed ideas. Squad Leader Jia Chengtian suggested: This is a deep mountain, with dense trees and plenty of firewood. We can light fires to melt the ice and frozen soil before construction. Based on his suggestion, piles of fires were lit. The soldiers' faces were red like copper, their hearts burning like fire. They melted a section, built a section, and the quotation signs led the way in front, while the highway extended forward...

The construction site was filled with melted muddy water. The soldiers spent the whole day dealing with ice, snow, and mud, and all looked like mud statues. Many comrades had their feet frozen and cracked, and their hands bleeding, but not a single person complained. Five Good Soldier Deng Daijiang had his hands frozen and bleeding, but when the platoon leader told him to rest, he refused. He said: To suffer a bit and shed some blood for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution is the honor of revolutionary soldiers.

The Fourth Squad encountered a large boulder as big as a room on their way forward. Under normal circumstances, this could be solved with explosives. However, there were high-voltage lines nearby, so they could not use explosives. The members of the Fourth Squad swung their hammers and smashed the boulder into pieces, removing the obstacle from their path.

The difficulties were overcome, and the road was completed ahead of schedule. On the day of completion, the soldiers held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and looked towards Beijing, shouting with joy, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The slogan echoed through the mountains and resonated in the sky.

　　天冷，胸中自有朝阳；地硬，勤读宝书四卷，人民工兵——
　　靠毛泽东思想筑起条条通天道
    正是漫天飞雪的隆冬季节，工程兵某部二连来到了海拔三千余米的高山上，担负修路任务。
    一月，这是高山上最寒冷的时候。山上的树木都裹上了一层厚厚的冰甲，沉甸甸地直不起腰来；白雪皑皑的山峰，象一把把出鞘的银剑，直插云天。山高风大，狂风伴着冰雪，掀起一团团浓烟般的雪雾，打得人眼睛都睁不开。山上的积雪滚落下来，把通往深山的一条盘山小道，变成了一条坚硬的冰碴道。二连的任务，就是要在这里修出一条路来，为部队开辟道路。
    任务是十分艰巨的。但是，再大的困难也挡不住用毛泽东思想武装起来的工程兵战士。在党支部领导下，全连掀起一个学习《愚公移山》的热潮。同志们纷纷表示决心，要奋战风雪高原，做毛泽东时代的“红愚公”。战士们说：在朝鲜战场，志愿军爬冰卧雪，面对着凶恶的美帝国主义，修起了一条条通往胜利的道路。今天，为保卫毛主席施工，为世界革命施工，这点风雪算得了什么！天冷，我们胸中有朝阳，能化开千里冰雪；地硬，我们有宝书四卷在手，能筑成条条通天大道。
    施工开始了，工地上竖起一块块红光闪闪的毛主席语录牌，上面写着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这是战士们心中的红灯，这是工程兵战士前进的指路标！他们高声朗读毛主席语录，抡起铁镐，劈山开路。地冻得象铁一般硬，一镐下去，胳膊震得发麻，只留下一个白点。怎么办？这样下去，施工进展缓慢，就会耽误工期。战士们立即召开“诸葛亮”会，大家出主意想办法。三班长贾成田提出建议：这里是深山野岭，树密柴多，可以升起火来，把冰层冻土烤化了再施工。根据他这个建议，一堆堆火光升起来了。战士们脸似赤铜，心如烈火，烤一段，修一段，语录牌在前面领路，公路在不断地向前延伸……
    工地上积满了烤化的泥水。战士们整天和冰雪泥水打交道，一个个都象泥人。许多同志脚冻裂了，手震出了血，但没有一个人叫苦。五好战士邓大江双手冻裂，出血不止，连长要他去休息，他硬是不肯。他说：为中国革命和世界革命吃点苦、流点血这是我们革命战士的光荣。
    四班在前进路上遇上了一间房子大小的一块大石头。这在一般情况下，可以用炸药解决问题。但是，这里附近有高压线，不能爆破。四班的同志就抡起铁锤，硬是一锤一锤地把它砸得粉碎，搬掉了前进路上的障碍。
    困难被战胜了，路提前修成了。在完工那天，战士们手擎着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，遥望北京，纵情欢呼“毛主席万岁！”口号声震撼群山，响彻云霄！
