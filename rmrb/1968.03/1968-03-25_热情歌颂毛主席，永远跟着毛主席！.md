Enthusiastically Praise Chairman Mao, Follow Chairman Mao Forever!

A red sun shines over the four seas, a billion red hearts turn towards the sun.
Beloved Chairman Mao! You are the great teacher of the revolutionary people of China and the world. Your brilliant thoughts illuminate the path of struggle for all oppressed nations and peoples, pointing the way to revolution. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand words cannot express the boundless love of the peoples of all countries for you, ten thousand songs cannot sing your boundless admiration. How many revolutionary peoples enthusiastically shout: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

The name Mao Zedong is victory

One day, we happily received a letter from a Greek friend praising Chairman Mao. Comrades eagerly passed it around. Every word in this letter is filled with boundless love for the great teacher of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao.

This Greek friend wrote passionately: "Mao Zedong, this brilliant name, has risen in the hearts of revolutionary peoples around the world as an eternal red sun. The name Mao Zedong, like a red sun, has shown the world a bright path. The name Mao Zedong is strength, is courage, is wisdom, is victory. The name Mao Zedong has reached the battlefield of Vietnam, where the victory flag flies in the wind, and the ocean of people's war will bury the American aggressors. This brilliant name has reached the front lines of Laos, where thunder roars in the valleys. This brilliant name has reached the African continent, awakening black brothers faster. This brilliant name has reached Latin America, where the flames of revolution burn brighter and brighter. ... The brilliant name Mao Zedong has made the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries tremble with fear. Under the inspiration of this brilliant name, revolutionary peoples of the world are fighting the revolution, their red hearts forever turning towards the red sun rising in the east."

We read this passionate letter in one breath, and a great warmth surged in our hearts.

A brilliant beacon illuminates Africa

At a poetry recital praising Chairman Mao, thunderous cheers erupted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" Friends from the five continents, filled with boundless love for the great teacher Mao, sang passionate and unrestrained songs of praise. A friend from Africa named Muhammad Ali recited a poem he wrote with great fervor:

"Mao Zedong Thought, shining with brilliance, has swept away the dark clouds over Africa.
Dark Africa, shining with the light of revolution.
Those heavy shackles cannot conquer the people's iron will!
Those prison doors and iron windows cannot lock away the revolutionary's lofty ideals!
Africa wants freedom! Africa wants liberation!
Take up arms, follow the path of Mao Zedong,
The storm of revolution grows stronger, the flames of struggle burn brighter! ... ...
Look! A brilliant beacon illuminates Africa, listen! The drums of revolution resound through the heavens.
Armed struggle, seize power, the devil's palace shakes in the waves.
Ah! The invincible Mao Zedong Thought, like a golden sun, shines over Africa,
Guiding us on the path to liberation, forever radiating the light of truth!"

How sincere the words are! This moving voice still echoes in our ears.

Advancing along the revolutionary course guided by Chairman Mao

"In the east, the red sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong..." This is a Japanese friend singing with abandon. How many days and nights, how many mornings and evenings, he has sung this solemn song of praise for the great teacher Mao.

This Japanese friend held a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," with an extremely excited heart, eagerly walked up to us, pointing to the golden Mao Zedong badge on his chest and said:

"Mao Zedong is the helmsman of the world revolution; the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the theory guiding the world revolution. Today, I have the opportunity to come to the great teacher of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao, to the base of world revolution, Beijing, to seek the great truth—the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. I am the happiest person in the world. How can I not sing with all my heart?" Saying this, he raised his arm and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Ten thousand years!"

Then, with boundless respect for Chairman Mao, he told us: "Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon of human liberation, the brightest star in the sky. Chairman Mao is the greatest genius of the proletariat in contemporary times.

'Following Mao Zedong!' This is the battle oath, the source of strength, and the belief in victory of revolutionary peoples around the world. I am determined to read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly advancing along the revolutionary course guided by Chairman Mao!" He became more and more excited, finally firmly saying: "I must study the guiding light, the spiritual atom bomb with boundless power—Mao Zedong Thought well. After I return to my country, I must propagate it well to the Japanese people. Imprisonment is nothing to fear, beheading is nothing to fear. Forever following Mao Zedong! This path I have decided to take!"

The revolutionary treasure, the great truth

The school bell rang, a group of foreign children marched in orderly rows, singing the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" song and left the school. Suddenly, a child from Latin America realized that his "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was missing. He was so anxious that his face turned red, and he ran back into the school. He searched from the classroom to the outside, from the ground floor to the upper floors, so eager to find his most beloved treasure book. But he still couldn't find it, and he cried. I went up to him, and he sobbed while saying to me: "I carry the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' every day. 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is the revolutionary treasure, the great truth. Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." At this time, a group of foreign children also ran up, everyone was anxious because he couldn't find his "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and I and the children also helped him search.

On the playground, a red treasure book shone brightly under the evening glow, radiating dazzling light. The children ran over in unison, and he was at the forefront, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with both hands, excitedly shouting: "Found it! Found it!" Everyone's gaze focused on this treasure book, and they cheered excitedly. Immediately, the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" echoed through the sky.

    热情歌颂毛主席，永远跟着毛主席！
    一轮红日照四海，亿万红心向太阳。
    敬爱的毛主席啊！您是中国和全世界革命人民的伟大导师，您的光辉的思想给全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民照亮了战斗的道路，指明了革命的方向。毛主席啊，毛主席！千言万语也说不完各国人民对您的无限热爱，千歌万曲也唱不尽各国人民对您的无限敬仰。多少革命的人民在热情地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
      毛泽东的名字就是胜利
    一天，我们高兴地收到了一位希腊朋友寄来的一封热情歌颂毛主席的信。同志们争先恐后地传阅着。在这封信里，一字一句都充满着对世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席的无限热爱。
    这位希腊朋友在信中热情地写道：“毛泽东，这个光辉的名字，在全世界革命人民心中升起了永远不落的红太阳。毛泽东这个光辉的名字，象一轮红日，为全世界指明了一条光明大道。毛泽东这个光辉的名字，就是力量，就是勇气，就是智慧，就是胜利。毛泽东这个光辉的名字，传到了战斗的越南，胜利的旗帜迎风飘扬，人民战争的汪洋大海，把美国强盗彻底埋葬。这个光辉的名字，传到了老挝前线，山谷里响起了春雷。这个光辉的名字，传到了非洲大陆，黑人兄弟更快地觉醒。这个光辉的名字，传到了拉丁美洲，熊熊的革命烈火越烧越旺。……毛泽东这个光辉的名字，吓得帝修反胆战心惊。全世界革命人民在这个光辉名字的鼓舞下干革命，红心永远向着东方升起的红太阳。”
    我们一口气读完了这封热情洋溢的信，心中涌起了一股巨大的暖流。
    光辉的灯塔照亮了非洲
    在一次歌颂毛主席的诗歌会上，响起了春雷般的欢呼声：“毛主席万岁！”
  “敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”来自五大洲的朋友们怀着对伟大导师毛主席的无限热爱，用最美好的语言，唱出一首首热情奔放的颂歌。一位名叫穆罕默德·阿里的非洲朋友慷慨激昂地朗诵了他写的一首诗篇：
    “光芒万丈的毛泽东思想传到了非洲，把满天的阴云扫荡。
    黑暗的非洲，闪耀着革命的火光。
    那千斤镣铐，征服不了人民的钢铁意志！
    那牢门铁窗，锁不住革命者的崇高理想！
    非洲要自由！非洲要解放！
    拿起武器，走毛泽东的道路，
    革命的风暴越来越猛，斗争的烈火越烧越旺！…………
    看！光辉的灯塔照亮了非洲，听！革命的战鼓在天地间震响。
    武装斗争，夺取政权，魔鬼的宫殿在怒涛中摇晃。
    啊！战无不胜的毛泽东思想，象金色的太阳照耀着非洲，
    指明了我们解放的道路，永远放射着真理的光芒！”
    多么真挚的语言啊！这动人的声音至今还响在我们的耳边。
    沿着毛主席指引的革命航道前进
    “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东。……”这是一位日本朋友在纵情歌唱。他多少个白天夜晚，多少个清晨黄昏，放声高唱这支歌颂伟大导师毛主席的庄严的颂歌。
    这位日本朋友手里拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，怀着无比激动的心情，兴致勃勃地走到我们的跟前，用手指着胸前金光闪闪的毛主席像章说：
  “毛泽东，是世界革命的舵手；战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是指导世界革命的理论。今天，我有机会来到世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席身旁，来到世界革命的根据地北京，寻求伟大的真理——光焰无际的毛泽东思想。我是世界上最幸福的人了。我怎能不尽情地歌唱？”说到这里，他振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    接着，他怀着对毛主席无限崇敬的心情对我们说：“毛泽东思想是人类解放的灯塔，是天上最亮最亮的北斗星。毛主席是当代无产阶级最伟大的天才。
  ‘跟着毛泽东！’这是全世界革命人民战斗的誓言、力量的源泉、胜利的信念。我决心一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的革命航道前进！”他越说越激动，最后坚定地说：“我一定要把指路的明灯、威力无穷的精神原子弹——毛泽东思想学好。我回国以后，一定要好好地向日本人民进行宣传。坐牢不要紧，砍头我不怕。永远跟着毛泽东！这条路我是走定了！”
    革命的宝书伟大的真理
    放学铃响了，一群外国小朋友排着整齐的队伍，高唱着毛主席语录歌离开了学校。忽然有一个拉丁美洲的小朋友，发现自己的《毛主席语录》不见了。他急得满脸通红，调回头就往学校里跑去。他从教室里找到教室外，从楼下找到楼上，多么想马上找到他最心爱的宝书啊。可是，还是找不到，他急得哭了。我迎了上去，他一面抽泣着，一面对我说：“我每天都带着《毛主席语录》。《毛主席语录》是革命的宝书，伟大的真理。大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”这时，一群外国小朋友也跑了上来，大家都为他找不着《毛主席语录》而着急，我和小朋友们也帮他找……。
    在操场上，一本红彤彤的宝书在晚霞的辉映下，放射出耀眼的光芒。小朋友们不约而同地跑过去，他跑在最前头，双手捧起《毛主席语录》，兴奋地喊道：“找到了！找到了！”大家的目光聚集在这本宝书上，并且兴奋地欢呼起来。顿时，“毛主席万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”的欢呼声响彻云霄。
