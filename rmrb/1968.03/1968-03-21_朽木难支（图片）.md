The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people to their very souls and a great revolution that thoroughly sweeps away all monsters and demons. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the revolutionary masses have, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, deeply exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the renegade, hidden traitor, and scab, Liu Shaoqi, and the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line of the renegade, hidden traitor, and scab, Deng Xiaoping. The revolutionary masses have, through great debate-arguments, great wrestling, and great criticism, thoroughly criticized and repudiated the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the renegade, hidden traitor, and scab, Liu Shaoqi, and the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line of the renegade, hidden traitor, and scab, Deng Xiaoping, and have thoroughly exposed their true colors as renegades, hidden traitors, and scabs.

The reactionary bourgeoisie and all reactionaries are very afraid of this great revolution that touches people to their very souls. They are even more afraid of the great debate-arguments, great wrestling, and great criticism that thoroughly expose their true colors. They are even more afraid of the revolutionary masses who dare to revolt and who are good at revolting. They are even more afraid of the great truth: "Rebellion is justified." They are even more afraid of the great truth: "You are the sons of the revolution, and we are the sons of the counter-revolution." They are even more afraid of the great truth: "The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours. You have forsook your interests with a full bosom and we have forsook our interests with an empty bosom, and so the future is yours. The enemy is reeling, and you are on the offensive worldwide."
