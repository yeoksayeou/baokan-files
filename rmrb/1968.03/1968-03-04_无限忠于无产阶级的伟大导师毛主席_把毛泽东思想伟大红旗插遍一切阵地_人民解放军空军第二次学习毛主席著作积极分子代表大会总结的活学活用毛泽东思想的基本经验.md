The great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman of the proletariat of our time, Chairman Mao, has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, elevating it to a new stage. In the history of Marxism, he has set up the third great milestone.

Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism. Spreading Mao Zedong Thought throughout China and the world, and firmly establishing the great Mao Zedong Thought, is a matter of paramount importance concerning the fate of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. It is the fundamental issue that determines everything. Around this issue, Marxism-Leninism and counter-revolutionary revisionism are engaged in a long and fierce struggle both domestically and globally.

In this struggle that decides the fate of humanity, our beloved Vice Chairman Lin Biao, who is infinitely loyal to the great teacher of the proletariat Chairman Mao, has always followed Chairman Mao closely, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and unswervingly defended the great leader Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He has engaged in a head-on struggle against both "left" and right opportunist lines. With the strongest revolutionary will, Vice Chairman Lin has overcome the sabotage and interference of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and all class enemies, and in the army, the Party, and the country, he has steadfastly and actively advocated and vigorously promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. He has opened up the fundamental path for hundreds of millions of people to directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, making outstanding contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

Vice Chairman Lin's series of important instructions on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is to make us infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must truly master Mao Zedong Thought and follow Chairman Mao in revolution to the end. However, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as China's Khrushchev, fiercely oppose the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and strive to obstruct and sabotage the combination of Mao Zedong Thought with the broad masses.

The struggle between the two fundamentally opposed attitudes towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is a struggle over what ideological guidance to use in building the Party, the army, and the country. It is a struggle over which path China and the world should take. This struggle has always been the focal point of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line within our Party over the past few decades, and it is also the focal point of the struggle between the two lines in the international communist movement today.

Only by understanding the problem in this way can we truly grasp the great strategic significance of the entire set of policies, principles, and methods proposed by Vice Chairman Lin for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Only then can we more consciously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, more effectively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and truly be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. Otherwise, we will deviate from the requirements of the times, fall behind, and make serious mistakes.

The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the Air Force has been continuously deepened under this situation of struggle, and a new situation has emerged. The broad cadres and soldiers regard studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought as the first need of life. Their lofty feelings towards the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought have reached a new height and a new realm. Everyone's deep feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought are most concentrated in the five shining golden words: "Loyal to Chairman Mao."

In recent years, especially since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the fundamental experience of the Air Force in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is: consciously raise Vice Chairman Lin's series of policies, principles, and methods for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to the height of the struggle between the two lines, and take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example. Be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao is the highest revolutionary principle for proletarian revolutionary fighters, and it is the fundamental motive force and purpose for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

	(1) Loyalty to Chairman Mao means having profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." The attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is first and foremost a class feelings issue. Having profound proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao is a manifestation of a firm proletarian stance and a high degree of proletarian consciousness. With such profound proletarian feelings, Chairman Mao's instructions will be heard with special affection, studied with special seriousness, and applied with great vigor. One will firmly believe in Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao closely, and fight for the proletarian revolutionary cause for life. Proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao are the foundation of loyalty to Chairman Mao. The deeper the feelings, the more steadfast the loyalty.

How to deepen proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao? The main experience of the various units of the Air Force is:

Continuously raise the understanding of Mao Zedong Thought and elevate the proletarian feelings of loving Chairman Mao to the height of the new era of Mao Zedong Thought. The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in 1962: "From now on, over the next fifty to one hundred years, it will be a great era of thorough change in the social system of the world, a great era of upheaval, an era unprecedented in any previous historical period. In such an era, we must be prepared to engage in great struggles with many different characteristics from those of past eras." Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest ideological weapon for struggle in this great era, and it is the great banner of this great era. Only Mao Zedong Thought can ensure that our country and other countries that have established proletarian dictatorship prevent capitalist restoration; only Mao Zedong Thought can liberate oppressed nations and peoples; only Mao Zedong Thought can enable the people of countries whose power has been usurped by revisionism to overthrow the rule of revisionism and re-establish proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, loyalty to Chairman Mao is the first need of the times, the first need of the revolution, and the first need of the proletariat. Only by deeply understanding this fundamental issue can we elevate our proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao to the height of the new era of Mao Zedong Thought, and love, believe in, and be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao without reservation. To raise the understanding of Mao Zedong Thought, the primary task is to study and master Chairman Mao's theory, line, policies, methods, and principles on continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, and deeply understand their great significance for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. At the same time, we must repeatedly study and understand Vice Chairman Lin's lofty evaluation of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and raise our understanding to the height of Vice Chairman Lin's evaluation. The higher the understanding, the deeper the proletarian feelings of loving Chairman Mao.

We must deepen our proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao in revolutionary struggle practice. Mao Zedong Thought has a clear class nature and practicality. Its essence is to criticize, to struggle, and to revolutionize. "We must go to the masses, and we must go to the masses unconditionally, wholeheartedly, and for a long time, to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the fiery struggles," only then can we truly recognize Chairman Mao's genius, wisdom, greatness, and correctness, feel that Chairman Mao's words are great truths, and temper a strong revolutionary sentiment of clear hatred and love, always keeping our hearts connected with Chairman Mao's, and doing as Li Wentong comrade said: "Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao instructs me, I act accordingly; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I march forward!" The process of engaging in revolutionary struggle is the process of deepening proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad cadres and soldiers of the Air Force deeply feel that "the more revolutionary, the more one knows the truth of Chairman Mao's words; the more struggles, the more one feels the closeness of Chairman Mao's teachings." Every victory achieved by applying Mao Zedong Thought in struggle, every difficulty overcome, deepens the feelings for Chairman Mao by one more step. Many experiences show that continuing the revolution or stagnating is an important sign of whether one has proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. Those who slow down their revolutionary pace and live off old achievements will gradually weaken their proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao; those who stop their revolutionary pace will lose their proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and will definitely take the road of opposing the Party and socialism.

For leaders at all levels, being close to the masses and living among the people forever, struggling revolution together with the people, is the fundamental condition for deepening proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. Revolutionary masses love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Only by loving the masses can one truly love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; only by believing in the masses can one truly believe in Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. The closer one is to the masses, the deeper the feelings for Chairman Mao.

Conduct extensive class education and carry out mass activities to be loyal to Chairman Mao, strengthening proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. Over the past year, the various units of the Air Force have universally adopted methods such as reminiscing and comparing, recalling bitterness and sweetness, and using various forms to seize every opportunity to extensively and deeply carry out activities to be loyal to Chairman Mao, creating a strong atmosphere of loving Chairman Mao, raising the awareness of executing Chairman Mao's instructions, and deepening the hatred for class enemies. These activities not only express the boundless love for Chairman Mao but also further strengthen the proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao.

	(2) Loyalty to Chairman Mao means never forgetting class struggle, never forgetting proletarian dictatorship, and fiercely criticizing revisionism.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization." Vice Chairman Lin says, "Mao Zedong Thought reflects the objective laws of class struggle at home and abroad." "Mao Zedong Thought is the thought of class struggle." The issue of class struggle, the issue of the proletariat seizing and consolidating power, is the fundamental issue of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the first great proletarian cultural revolution in human history, deeply revealing the laws of class struggle in socialist society, and proposing a set of theories, lines, policies, methods, and principles on continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. He has raised the fundamental issue of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship to a higher stage both in theory and practice. To be loyal to Chairman Mao and truly master Mao Zedong Thought, we must strengthen the consciousness of class struggle, first learn and apply Chairman Mao's great theory on continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, and correctly understand and implement Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions. Forgetting class struggle, forgetting proletarian dictatorship, and forgetting the continuation of the revolution under proletarian dictatorship is forgetting the fundamental viewpoint of Mao Zedong Thought, equivalent to having no soul, doing things without roots, fighting without preparation, working without vigor, being confused, and not knowing how one's head was cut off.

To never forget class struggle, the first thing is to learn to use Chairman Mao's method of class analysis to distinguish right from wrong and friend from foe. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and use the perspective of class and class struggle, and the method of class analysis to view and analyze everything. The outstanding feature of class struggle under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship is that the main target of the revolution is the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, who wave the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. This brings new problems to the identification of friends and enemies and creates complex situations. If not handled well, friends may be mistaken for enemies and enemies for friends. In this situation, insisting on class analysis for people and things is of special importance. The relationship between people is a class relationship, a political relationship. Who to be close to, who to be distant from, who to support, and who to oppose must be based on political principles. This principle is to support or not support Chairman Mao, to support or not support Mao Zedong Thought, to support or not support Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

To never forget class struggle, one must learn Chairman Mao's teachings on line struggle, strengthen the consciousness of line struggle, and stand firmly on the proletarian stance. Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: In real class struggle, which side one stands on is a matter of stance, a primary matter, and other matters are secondary. This means that the issue of stance is above all other issues. If the stance is wrong, everything is wrong. "The greater the effort, the worse the result." Just like an airplane's course deviates, the faster it flies, the farther it deviates. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, class struggle, because the main enemy is the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, class struggle is prominently and concentratedly manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the Party, that is, the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road. Without the consciousness of line struggle, the consciousness of class struggle is abstract and incomplete. In the struggle between the two lines, supporting and implementing which line is the issue of which side one stands on, the most fundamental issue of stance. Without a firm proletarian stance and a clear consciousness of line struggle, it is easy to be deceived by the enemy who waves the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, and there is the danger of raising the gray flag, the white flag, and the black flag. Forgetting line struggle, one's ears and eyes become dull, and in critical moments, one will stand on the wrong side; remembering line struggle, one's ears and eyes become sharp, and in critical moments, one will see clearly, stand firmly, withstand the test, and stand firm.

To never forget class struggle, one must fiercely criticize revisionism. Chairman Mao said: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a critique of revisionism." We must fully mobilize the masses, closely link with reality, and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, to thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev, and thoroughly eliminate their influence.

To never forget class struggle, one must use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a guide, and continuously carry out education on the situation. Using Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze the complex situation of class struggle, unifying the understanding of the situation, and always maintaining the correct political direction and clear mind, can firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle," "All Party members, all the people of the country, do not think that one or two, three or four cultural revolutions will make everything peaceful and free from worries. Be always vigilant and never relax." We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, think about class struggle every day, every month, and every year; talk about class struggle every day, every month, and every year; and carry out class struggle education every day, every month, and every year. We must create a strong atmosphere of class struggle education, deepen the consciousness of class struggle, heighten the alertness of class struggle, and permeate the thought of class struggle into all aspects of combat, work, and life.

	(3) Loyalty to Chairman Mao means insisting on the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, applying Mao Zedong Thought as learned, and closely following Chairman Mao step by step.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The issue of academic style is an issue of the ideological method of the leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members, an issue of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism, and an issue of the work attitude of all comrades in the Party. Since this is the case, the issue of academic style is a very important issue, the first important issue." The most important aspect of the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao is the combination of theory and practice. Studying Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's instructions is to learn and apply, to learn a little and apply a little, to say and do, to be consistent in words and deeds, and to see immediate results. Whether to apply or not to apply what is learned, whether to implement or not to implement, whether to combine learning with application or to separate them, is a reflection of the two fundamentally opposed stances of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, an issue of class feelings and fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao, and an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Standing on the proletarian stance, one will inevitably feel that Chairman Mao's words are shining with golden light, every word and sentence represents the highest interests of the proletariat and the working people, and every word and sentence speaks to one's heart. One will not only study eagerly but also implement resolutely. "Loyalty brings trust, trust brings application, and application brings effectiveness." If standing on the bourgeois or petty-bourgeois stance, one will adopt a completely wrong attitude towards Chairman Mao's instructions, lack enthusiasm for working on the "application" aspect, and even distort and secretly oppose, "speak beautifully but act differently, shout support but do the opposite."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new problem in human history, and as the revolution deepens, new things emerge one after another. To keep up with the situation and complete the glorious tasks assigned by the great leader Chairman Mao, the most fundamental thing is to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously study, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. Whether one can learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought to a new level depends on whether one can closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao. The closer one follows, the deeper one learns, the more active one applies, the faster one progresses, and the greater the achievements.

Closely following the great commander Chairman Mao means having a strong proletarian party spirit. One must firmly believe in and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, even if one does not fully understand them at first. Chairman Mao is the greatest genius, and Chairman Mao's instructions are great scientific foresights. Many instructions we often do not understand or do not understand at all at the beginning. Not understanding shows that our thoughts do not conform to or do not fully conform to Mao Zedong Thought, showing that our party spirit is not pure. At this time, we must emphasize resolute implementation. Only in this way can we ensure that we do not make mistakes in the general direction, and even if we make mistakes, they can be easily corrected. From not understanding to understanding is a process of changing thoughts and raising consciousness through revolutionary struggle practice. Therefore, we must study diligently and think hard while implementing, and through struggle practice, speed up the understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions and deepen the understanding of Mao Zedong Thought. Those who do so will learn Chairman Mao's instructions well, have high awareness of implementation, and follow closely.

Closely following the great commander Chairman Mao means having high revolutionary enthusiasm. Implementing Chairman Mao's instructions swiftly and decisively, always being politically sensitive, and listening to Chairman Mao's voice from documents, broadcasts, newspapers, etc. When Chairman Mao gives an order, one must act with the spirit of "seizing the day," using the fastest speed and most effective methods to transmit, study, deeply understand, and resolutely implement. One must drive the instructions of Chairman Mao straight to the broad cadres and soldiers. Only by handing over Chairman Mao's instructions to the masses can we truly implement them sentence by sentence, item by item, and comprehensively. Closely following means being fast. One must transmit fast, implement fast, and respond fast. Following but not closely, always being passive, will inevitably fall behind.

Closely following the great commander Chairman Mao means having revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline. One must strictly demand, obey orders, and absolutely not engage in anarchism. Chairman Mao's instructions are the highest commands. We must do as Chairman Mao says, and go where Chairman Mao points. We must obey orders and implement them, no matter what obstacles, difficulties, or dangers we encounter. We must firmly implement what Chairman Mao does not allow and resolutely not do what Chairman Mao does not allow. Everything must be based on Chairman Mao's instructions, and firmly oppose interference from all sides, whether from the right or the extreme "left." We must resolutely push it back.

Closely following the great commander Chairman Mao means strengthening reporting and requests. One must always place oneself and the units one leads under the absolute leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and under the direct command of Vice Chairman Lin. One must seriously study and resolutely implement all important instructions from the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. Every important instruction from the Party Central Committee and the Central Cultural Revolution Group embodies the great Mao Zedong Thought and the great, wise, and correct leadership of the highest commander Chairman Mao. In all situations, one must strengthen reporting and requests and never be self-righteous, self-important, or self-willed. Only by reporting and requesting more can one closely follow Chairman Mao and successfully complete all tasks assigned by Chairman Mao.

Closely following the great commander Chairman Mao means having a strong spirit of self-criticism. One must correctly treat achievements and mistakes, not be arrogant when achieving something, and not have an inflated brain. All our achievements are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The more achievements, the more one must face one's shortcomings, strive to study Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, overcome shortcomings, and carry forward achievements to continue advancing. Being correct once does not guarantee being correct all the time; arrogance and complacency will inevitably turn into mistakes. Mistakes are ultimately due to deviating from Mao Zedong Thought. When making mistakes, one must seriously conduct self-criticism, change quickly, and change thoroughly. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, continuously learning from revolutionary practice, is an important method for studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

	(4) Loyalty to Chairman Mao means fiercely fighting against selfishness, firmly establishing selflessness, and cultivating the revolutionary spirit of bravery and fearlessness of death.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches people's souls. The more the revolution advances, the deeper it touches people's souls, the more prominent and sharp the contradiction between the proletariat's "selflessness" and the bourgeoisie's "selfishness" becomes, and the higher and more urgent the requirement to break selfishness and establish selflessness becomes. Without breaking selfishness, the defeated class enemies will revive through "selfishness," and without breaking selfishness, one will be "peacefully transformed" by class enemies. Only by consciously breaking selfishness and establishing selflessness can one truly be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. The deeper one fights against selfishness, the closer one is to Chairman Mao; the fiercer one fights against selfishness, the closer one follows Chairman Mao; with a heart for the public, one is most loyal to Chairman Mao.

Breaking selfishness and establishing selflessness means focusing on major principles. In this way, one can break selfishness at the root and establish selflessness at the foundation. Focusing only on minor principles and not on major principles will make one a political mediocrity, seemingly passing in daily life but failing in critical moments. Focusing on major principles means focusing on the attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly breaking all erroneous thoughts that hinder the understanding and implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions, and doing one's best in any situation and at any time to believe in Chairman Mao, believe in Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, and unswervingly follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary road. This is great selflessness and great loyalty; the opposite is great selfishness and great evil. Focusing on major principles but not neglecting minor principles. Minor principles must also be treated seriously, strictly demanded, and strived to be good in both major and minor principles.

Breaking selfishness and establishing selflessness means establishing the worldview of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. For the army, the most prominent and concentrated task is to cultivate and establish the revolutionary spirit of bravery and fearlessness of death, firmly establishing the determination to bravely sacrifice for Chairman Mao, for Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Having the revolutionary spirit of "being ready at any time to sacrifice one's life for our cause," is the concentrated expression of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and it is the peak that must be climbed in thoroughly transforming the worldview. Climbing this peak, on the battlefield, one will dare to engage in close combat at night, with bayonets, fearlessly advancing, bravely defeating the enemy, being able to attack and defend; in fierce class struggles, one will dare to resist evil winds and waves, fear no violence, and be unyielding; in dangerous and risky situations, one will dare to step forward, sacrifice for the public, sacrifice for others, and be willing to give up everything. Many comrades have already bravely climbed this peak. They believe that "a life shining with Mao Zedong Thought, even if it is short, is the most glorious; a life without Mao Zedong Thought, even if it is long, is meaningless." "To bravely sacrifice for defending Chairman Mao is to live even after death; to live for personal selfishness is to die even after living." Establishing the revolutionary spirit of bravery and fearlessness of death is a fierce battle to smash China's Khrushchev's philosophy of living, the philosophy of betrayal, a fierce revolution in the depths of the soul, and a violent action of the proletariat's "selflessness" completely defeating the bourgeoisie's "selfishness." The human brain is a battlefield of class struggle. Proletarian thought and bourgeois thought are constantly fighting for supremacy, one rising while the other falls, and there is no third way. Therefore, breaking selfishness and establishing selflessness must be done with high standards, high speed, and high posture. One must fight an "offensive battle," not just a "defensive battle," and not "peacefully transition." Compromising, being moderate, and being reformist is actually a defender of "selfishness," paving the way for revisionism. Countless facts show that those who engage in reformism in ideological transformation will definitely not be able to stand firm in politics and will fall into the quagmire of revisionism in the stormy waves of class struggle.

"The Three Articles" are the sharpest weapons for breaking selfishness and establishing selflessness, and for sparking a revolution in the depths of the soul. "The Three Articles" shine with the spirit of communism, condense the essence of the proletarian worldview, and are the most fundamental compulsory course for proletarian revolutionary fighters. As long as we study them frequently and apply them frequently, learning a little and applying a little, we will definitely be able to establish a red world of pure selflessness in our minds and definitely be able to climb the peak of the proletarian revolutionary spirit of bravery and fearlessness of death.

	(5) Loyalty to Chairman Mao means always emphasizing proletarian politics and planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought everywhere.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that politics is the commander, the soul, and the lifeline of all work. Vice Chairman Lin says: "We must let hundreds of millions of people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions, use Mao Zedong Thought to change the spiritual face of the whole society, and let the great spiritual force of Mao Zedong Thought become a great material force!"

Emphasizing politics and letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions is a need of class struggle, a need to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and prevent capitalist restoration, and a need for the construction of our army. Political work is about guiding thoughts, guiding souls, and guiding revolutionization, and it is the general manager of all industries. Emphasizing politics or emphasizing military affairs has always been the focal point of the struggle between the two lines in our army. Insisting on the road of emphasizing proletarian politics is loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; opposing the road of emphasizing proletarian politics is betraying Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Emphasizing proletarian politics is emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought, which is to plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought everywhere.

Planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought everywhere means using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. When executing various tasks and conducting various activities, one must first study Chairman Mao's works, clarify the political direction, find the guiding ideology, and use Mao Zedong Thought to command the entire process of the activity. Let Mao Zedong Thought occupy a dominant position in 100% of time, space, and personnel, and one can advance fearlessly and be invincible.

Planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought everywhere means using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. Guided by Mao Zedong Thought, people are the wisest and most innovative, daring to walk paths that others have not walked, and will "discover, invent, create, and advance." Various works will make rapid progress and have a completely new appearance.

Planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought everywhere means using Mao Zedong Thought to transform everything. Carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to venture, and dare to do, mobilizing the masses, boldly eliminating all old ideas, old habits, and old frameworks that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically supporting all new things that conform to Mao Zedong Thought, and accelerating the revolutionary and modern construction of our army. A large number of facts show that by fully mobilizing the masses and transforming the world according to Mao Zedong Thought, no height is insurmountable, and any human miracle can be created.

Planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought everywhere means, in all work and all activities, first carrying out the thought revolutionization of people, using the thought revolutionization to promote work revolutionization, and using Mao Zedong Thought to promote everything. Vice Chairman Lin says: "All our work must be led by Mao Zedong Thought. We must hold fast to this spiritual front. We must fight this battle to the end. Only by winning the battle in the brain can we win the material battle." Work is complex, but we must grasp the thought revolutionization of people and the Mao Zedong Thought consciousness of people. When people's Mao Zedong Thought consciousness is raised, everything is achieved, including bravery, initiative, creativity, organizational discipline, and material results will come in an endless stream.

In summary, planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought everywhere, using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, guide everything, transform everything, and promote everything, is a profound revolution in all fields, first and foremost a thought revolution, and a process full of sharp and complex struggles. Only by fully mobilizing the masses, fiercely criticizing bourgeois military thought, thoroughly eliminating its influence, breaking away from bourgeois and all exploiting class old ideas, old habits, and firmly establishing Mao Zedong Thought, and having everyone guard the gate of emphasizing proletarian politics, can we persistently carry out this revolution and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high on all positions.

    无限忠于无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席
    把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地
    ——人民解放军空军第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会总结的活学活用毛泽东思想的基本经验
    当代无产阶级和革命人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段，在马克思主义发展史上树立了第三个伟大的里程碑。
    毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。在全中国、全世界传播毛泽东思想，大立伟大的毛泽东思想，这是关系到中国人民和世界革命人民命运的头等大事，是决定一切的根本问题。围绕着这一问题，马克思列宁主义同反革命修正主义之间，不仅在国内进行着长期的激烈的斗争，在全世界范围也正在展开尖锐的斗争。
    在这场决定人类命运的斗争中，我们敬爱的副统帅林彪同志，无限忠于无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席，一贯紧跟毛主席，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，始终不渝地捍卫伟大领袖毛主席、伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同“左”的和右的机会主义路线进行了针锋相对的斗争。林副主席以最坚强的革命毅力，战胜党内最大的一小撮走资派和一切阶级敌人的种种破坏和干扰，在全军、全党和全国坚定不移地积极倡导、全力推进活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，开辟了亿万群众直接掌握毛泽东思想的根本途径，对中国革命和世界革命作出了杰出的贡献。
    林副主席关于活学活用毛主席著作的一系列重要指示，就是要我们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，真正把毛泽东思想学到手，跟着毛主席革命到底。而中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派，却疯狂反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，竭力阻挠和破坏毛泽东思想同广大群众的结合。
    对待毛主席和毛泽东思想两种根本对立的态度之间的斗争，就是用什么指导思想来建党、建军、建国的斗争，是中国和世界走什么道路的斗争。这一斗争，一直是我党几十年来无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线斗争的集中点，也是当前国际共产主义运动中两条路线斗争的集中点。
    只有这样地认识问题，才能真正理解林副主席提出的一整套活学活用毛主席著作的方针、原则和方法的伟大战略意义，才能更自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，更得力地全面落实毛主席的最新指示，才能真正忠于伟大领袖毛主席。否则，就要背离时代的要求，掉大队，犯大错误。
    空军活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，就是在这种斗争形势下不断深入地开展起来的，并出现了新的局面。广大指战员把活学活用毛泽东思想作为生活的第一需要，对伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的崇高感情，达到了新的高度，进入了新的境界。大家对毛主席和毛泽东思想的深厚感情，最集中地凝结在“忠于毛主席”这五个金光闪闪的大字上。
    几年来，特别是无产阶级文化大革命以来，空军活学活用毛泽东思想的根本经验是：把林副主席关于活学活用毛主席著作的一系列方针、原则和方法，自觉地提到两条路线斗争的高度来认识和贯彻，以林副主席为光辉榜样，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。无限忠于毛主席，这是无产阶级革命战士高于一切的革命大节，是活学活用毛泽东思想的根本动力和根本目的。
        （一）忠于毛主席，就要对
    伟大领袖毛主席有无限深厚的无
    产阶级感情
    林副主席指出：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”对毛主席和毛泽东思想的态度，首先是阶级感情问题。对毛主席怀有深厚的无产阶级感情，是坚定的无产阶级立场和高度的无产阶级觉悟的表现。有了这种深厚的无产阶级感情，对毛主席的指示，就“听起来格外亲切，学起来特别认真，用起来浑身是劲”，就能坚信毛主席，紧跟毛主席，为无产阶级革命事业战斗终生。对毛主席的无产阶级感情，是忠于毛主席的基础。感情越深厚，忠的信念越牢固。
    怎样加深对毛主席的无产阶级感情？空军各部队的主要体会是：
    不断提高对毛泽东思想的认识，把热爱毛主席的无产阶级感情提到毛泽东思想新时代的高度。伟大领袖毛主席在一九六二年指出：“从现在起，五十年内外到一百年内外，是世界上社会制度彻底变化的伟大时代，是一个翻天覆地的时代，是过去任何一个历史时代都不能比拟的。处在这样一个时代，我们必须准备进行同过去时代的斗争形式有着许多不同特点的伟大的斗争。”毛泽东思想就是我们这个伟大时代进行斗争的最锐利的思想武器，是我们这个伟大时代的伟大旗帜。只有毛泽东思想，才能保证我国和其他已经建立了无产阶级专政的国家，防止资本主义复辟；才能使被压迫民族、被压迫人民得到解放；才能使被修正主义篡夺了政权的国家的人民推翻修正主义的统治，重建无产阶级专政。因此，忠于毛主席，是时代的第一需要，是革命的第一需要，是无产阶级利益的第一需要。只有深刻认识这个根本问题，才能把对毛主席的无产阶级感情提到毛泽东思想新时代的高度，对伟大领袖毛主席无比热爱、无比坚信、无比忠诚。要提高对毛泽东思想的认识，首要的是学习和掌握毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，深刻理解它对中国革命和世界革命的伟大意义。同时，要反复学习和领会林副主席对毛主席和毛泽东思想的崇高评价，把我们的认识提到林副主席评价的高度。认识提得越高，热爱毛主席的无产阶级感情就越深。
    要在革命斗争实践中加深对毛主席的无产阶级感情。毛泽东思想具有鲜明的阶级性和实践性，它的基本点是要批判、要斗争、要革命。“必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”，才能真正认识到毛主席的天才、英明、伟大和正确，体会到毛主席的话是伟大的真理，才能锻炼出爱憎分明的强烈革命感情，时时刻刻和毛主席心连心，做到象李文忠同志那样“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进”！从事革命斗争的过程，就是加深对毛主席无产阶级感情的过程。通过无产阶级文化大革命，空军广大指战员深深体会到，“革命更知毛主席的话儿灵，斗争倍觉毛主席的教导亲”。在斗争中运用毛泽东思想每取得一个胜利，克服一次困难，对毛主席的感情就加深一分。很多经验说明，继续革命还是停滞不前，这是对毛主席有没有无产阶级感情的一个重要标志。谁的革命步伐放慢了，吃老本，他对毛主席的无产阶级感情就会逐渐淡薄；谁的革命步伐停止了，他对毛主席的无产阶级感情也就没有了，就一定会走上反党反社会主义的道路。
    对各级领导干部来说，密切联系群众，永远生活在群众之中，同群众一起闹革命，这是加深对毛主席无产阶级感情的根本条件。革命群众最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话。只有热爱群众，才能真正热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想；只有相信群众，才能真正相信毛主席和毛泽东思想。同群众靠得越近，对毛主席感情越深。
    大抓阶级教育，开展群众性的忠于毛主席的活动，增强对毛主席的无产阶级感情。一年多来，空军各部队普遍采取回忆对比、忆苦思甜等方法进行阶级教育，采用多种多样的形式，利用一切时机，广泛深入地开展了忠于毛主席的活动，把热爱毛主席的空气搞得浓浓的，把执行毛主席指示的自觉性提得高高的，把对阶级敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，极大地提高了广大指战员无限忠于毛主席的觉悟。这些活动，既表达了对毛主席的无限热爱，又进一步增强了对毛主席的无产阶级感情。
      （二）忠于毛主席，就要念念
  不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶
  级专政，狠批修正主义
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”林副主席说，“毛泽东思想，反映了国内国际阶级斗争的客观规律”。“毛泽东思想就是阶级斗争的思想”。阶级斗争问题，无产阶级夺取政权和巩固政权问题，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的根本问题。毛主席亲自发动和领导了人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命，深刻地揭示了社会主义社会的阶级斗争规律，提出了一整套关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，把阶级斗争和无产阶级专政这个马克思主义的根本问题，在理论上和实践上都提高到了更高的阶段。要忠于毛主席，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，就必须加强阶级斗争观念，首先学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大理论，正确理解和贯彻执行毛主席一系列极为重要的最新指示。忘记了阶级斗争，忘记了无产阶级专政，忘记了无产阶级专政下继续革命，就是忘记了毛泽东思想的根本观点，就等于没有灵魂，就办事没有根，打仗没有准，干工作没有劲，就是糊涂虫，脑袋掉了还不知道怎么掉的。
    念念不忘阶级斗争，首要的是学会运用毛主席的阶级分析的方法，分辨是非，分清敌我。我们要牢记毛主席的教导，要用阶级和阶级斗争的观点，用阶级分析的方法去看待一切、分析一切。无产阶级专政条件下阶级斗争的突出特点是，革命主要对象是党内一小撮走资派，他们打着“红旗”反红旗。这就给识别敌我带来了新的问题，出现了复杂的情况。搞不好，就会认敌为友，视友为敌。在这种情况下，对人对事坚持阶级分析，就更有特殊重要的意义。人和人之间的关系是阶级关系，政治关系。亲近谁，疏远谁，拥护谁，反对谁，必须以政治原则为标准。这个标准就是拥护不拥护毛主席，拥护不拥护毛泽东思想，拥护不拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    念念不忘阶级斗争，就要学好毛主席关于路线斗争的教导，增强路线斗争观念，站稳无产阶级立场。林副主席指出：在现实的阶级斗争中，站在哪一边，这是个立场问题，是个首要问题，其他都是附带的问题。这就是说，立场问题是高于一切的问题，立场错了，一切皆错，“干劲”越大越糟糕。就象飞机航向偏了，速度越大，偏得越远。在无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，由于党内一小撮走资派是主要敌人，所以，阶级斗争就突出地、集中地表现为党内两条路线的斗争，也就是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的斗争。没有路线斗争观念，阶级斗争观念就是抽象的，不彻底的。在两条路线斗争中拥护和执行哪条路线，就是跟谁走的问题，是最根本的立场问题。没有坚定的无产阶级立场，没有明确的路线斗争观念，就容易被打着“红旗”反红旗的敌人所蒙蔽，就有打灰旗、打白旗、打黑旗的危险。忘记路线斗争，就耳目失灵，在关键时刻就会站错队；牢记路线斗争，就耳聪目明，在关键时刻看得清，站得稳，顶得住，过得硬。
    念念不忘阶级斗争，就要狠批修正主义。毛主席说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”要充分发动群众，紧密联系实际，深入开展革命大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们的流毒。
    念念不忘阶级斗争，就要以毛主席的最新指示为指针，不断进行形势教育。用毛泽东思想去观察、分析错综复杂的阶级斗争形势，统一对形势的认识，时刻保持正确的政治方向和清醒的头脑，才能坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。毛主席教导我们：
  “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，“全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，对于阶级斗争，要天天想，月月想，年年想；天天讲，月月讲，年年讲；天天搞，月月搞，年年搞。要把阶级斗争教育的空气搞得浓浓的，把阶级斗争观念搞得深深的，把阶级斗争的警惕性提得高高的，使阶级斗争的思想贯彻到战斗、工作、生活的一切领域中。
      （三）忠于毛主席，就要坚
  持毛主席倡导的革命学风，对
  毛泽东思想学了就用，步步紧跟
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。”毛主席倡导的革命学风，最重要的就是理论联系实际。学习毛主席著作，学习毛主席的指示，就是要学了就用，学一点用一点，说到做到，言行一致，立竿见影。学了，用还是不用，执行还是不执行，是学以致用还是学用脱节，这是无产阶级和资产阶级两种根本对立的立场的反映，是对毛主席的阶级感情问题、根本态度问题，是对毛主席忠不忠的重要标志。站在无产阶级的立场上，必然感到毛主席的话金光闪闪，字字句句都代表了无产阶级和劳动人民的最高利益，字字句句都讲到自己的心坎上，不仅会如饥似渴地学习，也一定会雷厉风行地坚决照办。“忠必信，信必用，用必灵”。如果站在资产阶级、小资产阶级的立场上，对毛主席的指示就会采取完全错误的态度，对在“用”字上下功夫就缺乏热情，甚至断章取义，阳奉阴违，“讲得呱呱叫，实际做不到，嘴里喊拥护，行动另一套”。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是人类历史上崭新的问题，随着革命的深入发展，新事物层出不穷。要跟上形势，完成伟大领袖毛主席交给的光荣任务，最根本的是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真学习、坚决执行毛主席一系列最新指示。学习毛泽东思想，能不能学出新水平，用出新水平，关键在于能不能紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，跟得越紧，学得越深，用得越活，进步越快，成绩越大。
    紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，就要有坚强的无产阶级党性。对毛主席的指示坚信不疑，理解的坚决执行，暂时不完全理解的也坚决执行，在执行中加深理解。毛主席是最伟大的天才，毛主席的指示是高瞻远瞩的伟大科学预见，有很多指示我们往往开始不甚理解，或很不理解。不理解，正说明我们的思想不符合或不完全符合毛泽东思想，说明我们的党性还不纯，这时更要强调坚决执行，只有这样，才能保证在大方向上不至于犯错误，即使犯了错误也容易纠正。由不理解到理解，是一个通过革命斗争实践改造思想、提高觉悟的过程。所以，要在执行中刻苦学习，勤奋思考，通过斗争实践，加速对毛主席指示的理解，加深对毛泽东思想的领会。凡是这样做的，对毛主席的指示，学得就好，执行的自觉性就高，跟得就紧。
    紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，就要有高度的革命热情。执行毛主席的指示，雷厉风行，闻风而动。时时刻刻以最高的政治敏感，从文件、广播、报纸等各个方面听取伟大统帅毛主席的声音。毛主席一声令下，就要以“只争朝夕”的精神，用最快的速度，最有效的方法，传达、学习，深刻领会，坚决执行。要一竿子插到底，让毛主席的指示原原本本地直接和广大指战员见面。只有把毛主席的指示交给群众，才能真正做到句句落实，条条落实，全面落实。紧跟，贵在一个“快”字，要传达快，执行快，回音快。跟而不紧，老是被动，必然落伍。
    紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，就要有革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。要严格要求，令行禁止，绝对不搞无政府主义。毛主席的指示是最高命令，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做，毛主席指向那里，我们就奔向那里。有令则行，毛主席要我们做的，不管遇到什么阻力，什么困难，什么危险，就是上刀山下火海，也要坚决执行，坚决完成。有禁则止，毛主席不让做的，坚决不做。一切以毛主席的指示为准，坚决反对来自各方面的干扰，不管是来自右的方面，还是极“左”的方面，都要坚决把它顶回去。
    紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，就要加强请示报告。要把自己和自己所领导的单位，永远置于伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的绝对领导之下，置于林副主席的直接指挥之下。必须认真学习和坚决贯彻落实以毛主席为首的党中央和中央文革小组的一切重要指示。党中央、中央文革小组每一个重要指示，都体现了伟大的毛泽东思想，体现了最高统帅毛主席的伟大、英明、正确的领导。在各种情况下，都要加强请示报告，绝不能自作聪明，自以为是，自作主张。只有多请示报告，才能紧跟毛主席，胜利完成毛主席交给的一切任务。
    紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，就要有严格的自我批评精神。要正确对待成绩和错误，有了成绩，不翘尾巴，脑子不膨胀。我们一切成绩都是毛泽东思想的胜利。越有成绩，越要正视缺点，努力学习毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，克服缺点，发扬成绩，继续前进。一时正确，不能保证经常正确；骄傲自满就必然转化为错误。犯错误，归根结底都是由于背离了毛泽东思想。犯了错误，要认真地做自我批评，迅速改，彻底改。以毛泽东思想为指针，从革命实践中不断吸取经验教训，这是学习和掌握毛泽东思想的重要方法。
    （四）忠于毛主席，就要狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，发扬勇敢、不怕死的革命献身精神
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命。革命越向前发展，触及人们的灵魂越深刻，无产阶级的“公”字和资产阶级的“私”字的矛盾就越突出、越尖锐，破私立公的要求就越来越高，越来越迫切。不破私，被打倒的阶级敌人就会借“私”还魂，死灰复燃，不破私，就会被阶级敌人“和平演变”过去。只有自觉地破私立公，才能真正无限忠于毛主席。斗私越深，对毛主席越亲；斗私越狠，跟毛主席越紧；一心为公，对毛主席最忠。
    破私立公，要着重抓大节。这样，才能破私破在要害处，立公立在根本上。只抓小节，不抓大节，就会成为政治上的庸人，平时似乎过得去，但到紧要关头就过不得硬。抓大节，就是抓对毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线的态度，大破特破阻碍理解和执行毛主席指示的一切错误思想，做到在任何时候、任何情况下，都坚信毛主席，坚信毛泽东思想，坚决执行毛主席的指示，坚定不移地走毛主席的革命道路。这就是大公，大忠；相反，就是大私，大坏。着重抓大节，但不能忽视小节。对小节问题也要认真对待，严格要求，努力做到大节好，小节也好。
    破私立公，就是要树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的世界观。对于军队来说，最突出、最集中的是要培养和确立勇敢、不怕死的革命献身精神，牢固地树立起为毛主席、为毛泽东思想、为毛主席革命路线勇于献身的坚强决心。具有“随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业”的革命献身精神，这是无限忠于毛主席的集中表现，是彻底改造世界观必须攀登的高峰。攀登上了这个高峰，在战场上，就敢于近战夜战，刺刀见红，一往无前，勇敢歼敌，攻能攻得上，守能守得住；在激烈的阶级搏斗中，就敢于顶妖风，抗恶浪，不畏强暴，宁死不屈；在危急、艰险的情况下，就敢于挺身而出，舍己为公，舍己为人，不惜献出一切。我们有很多同志已经豪迈地登上了这个高峰。他们认为，“闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的生命，再短促也无尚光荣；离开了毛泽东思想的生命，活得再长也无意义”。“为保卫毛主席英勇献身，虽死犹生；为个人苟且偷生，虽生犹死。”确立勇敢、不怕死的革命献身精神，是摧毁中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学、叛徒哲学的一场激烈战斗，是灵魂深处的一场激烈革命，是无产阶级“公”字彻底战胜资产阶级“私”字的暴烈行动。人的头脑就是一个阶级斗争的战场，无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想，时刻展开争夺战，此长彼消，彼长此消，没有第三条道路可走。因此，破私立公必须高标准，高速度，高姿态。要打“进攻战”，不能只打“防御战”，不能“和平过渡”。搞调和，搞折中，搞改良主义，实际上就是“私”字的保皇派，为修正主义鸣锣开道。无数事实证明，在思想改造上搞改良主义的人，在政治上一定过不得硬，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中就会自觉不自觉地跌入修正主义的泥坑。
      “老三篇”是打破私立公“进攻战”、在灵魂深处爆发革命的最锐利的武器。“老三篇”闪耀着共产主义精神的光辉，凝结着无产阶级世界观的精髓，是无产阶级革命战士最根本的必修课。只要我们经常学，经常用，学一点，用一点，就一定能够在头脑中建立一个红彤彤的纯公精神世界，就一定能攀登上无产阶级的勇敢、不怕死的革命献身精神的高峰。
      （五）忠于毛主席，就要永远
  突出无产阶级政治，把毛泽东思
  想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。林副主席说：“我们要让亿万人民掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，用毛泽东思想来改变整个社会的精神面貌，让毛泽东思想这个伟大的精神力量，变成伟大的物质力量！”
    突出政治，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，这是阶级斗争的需要，是巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的需要，是我军建设的需要。政治工作是管思想、管灵魂、管革命化的，是各行各业的总管。突出政治还是突出军事，一直是我军两条路线斗争的焦点。坚持走突出无产阶级政治的道路，就是对毛主席和毛泽东思想的忠诚；反对走突出无产阶级政治的道路，就是对毛主席和毛泽东思想的背叛。突出无产阶级政治，就是突出毛泽东思想，就是要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地。
    把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地，就要用毛泽东思想统帅一切。执行各种任务，进行各种活动，都要首先学习毛主席著作，明确政治方向，找出指导思想，用毛泽东思想统帅活动的全过程。让毛泽东思想在百分之百的时间、空间和人员中占统治地位，就能一往无前，战无不胜。
    把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地，就要用毛泽东思想指导一切。用毛泽东思想作指导，人最聪明，最有智慧，勇于创新，敢于走前人没有走过的路，就会“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”。各项工作就会突飞猛进，面貌焕然一新。
    把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍一切阵地，就要用毛泽东思想改造一切。发扬敢想、敢闯、敢干的革命精神，放手发动群众，大胆革除一切不符合毛泽东思想的旧思想、旧习惯、旧框框，热情扶植一切符合毛泽东思想的新事物，加速我军革命化现代化建设。大量事实证明，把群众充分发动起来，按照毛泽东思想改造世界，无高不可攀，什么人间奇迹也可以创造出来。
    把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地，就要在一切工作、一切活动中，首先大搞人的思想革命化，以思想革命化带动工作革命化，用毛泽东思想推动一切。林副主席说：“我们一切工作，要由毛泽东思想领先。我们要把毛泽东思想这一个精神战线抓住不放。要把这场战斗顽强打到底。脑袋中打了胜仗，物质的仗才能打胜。”工作千头万绪，就是要抓人的思想革命化，抓人的毛泽东思想觉悟。人的毛泽东思想觉悟提高了，就什么都有了，勇敢也有了，积极性也有了，创造性也有了，组织纪律性也有了，物质成果就源源而来。
    总之，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，改造一切，推动一切，是在一切领域中实行的一场深刻的大革命，首先是一场思想大革命，是一个充满尖锐复杂的斗争过程。只有放手发动群众，狠狠批判资产阶级军事思想，彻底肃清其影响，破除资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧习惯，大立毛泽东思想，人人把好突出无产阶级政治的关，才能把这场革命坚持不懈地进行下去，才能让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在一切阵地高高飘扬。（新华社）
