Under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary situation in Ma'anshan, one of China's important steel bases, is better than ever and continues to improve. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in the entire city are advancing courageously along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, determined to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In this excellent situation, the Ma'anshan Revolutionary Committee was successfully established on March 15. This is the first prefecture-level and municipal revolutionary committee established in Anhui Province. The establishment of the municipal revolutionary committee has not only promoted a new high tide of "grasping revolution and promoting production" in the Ma'anshan region but has also played a driving role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement throughout the province. Currently, the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination in Ma'anshan are being further consolidated and developed, and over 160 grassroots units in the entire city have established temporary power organs of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Our great leader Chairman Mao made two important inspections of the Ma'anshan region in 1958 and 1959 and gave extremely important instructions: "The conditions in Ma'anshan are good, and it can be developed into a medium-sized steel and iron combined enterprise," and "The development of the steel industry must be carried out through mass movements." The Ma'anshan working class, which is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, has followed Chairman Mao's instructions, relied on its own efforts, and striven to build a brand-new steel city at the fastest speed. However, Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Anhui have done everything possible to resist Chairman Mao's instructions and attempted to restore capitalism in Ma'anshan. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary main force of the working class in Ma'anshan, holding high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," has defeated Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Ma'anshan, achieving immortal merits.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued a series of latest instructions, the workers of Ma'anshan Steel, with deep class feelings of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have comprehensively implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions and advanced courageously according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. With the help of the People's Liberation Army's left-supporting troops, they have insisted on establishing and running well Mao Zedong Thought study classes. So far, over 3,000 study classes have been held in the entire city, with more than 110,000 people participating in the study, accounting for more than half of the city's population. In the study classes, they have taken "criticizing revisionism and repudiating self" as the key link, grasped class struggle, and persisted in carrying out the revolutionary great criticism to eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism in various fields; at the same time, they have severely criticized "self," eliminated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and overcome anarchism. In this struggle, the old workers of Ma'anshan Steel, who have deep hatred and bitterness, have played a significant role. They have taken the lead in carrying out class education and launched the "two remembrances and three examinations" activities. They have also taken young workers to visit the "mass grave" under Ma'anshan, recounting the suffering and oppression the working class endured in the old society, and conducting class education by comparing the two societies, which has achieved immediate effects. The two factions of the original Ma'anshan Coke Chemical Plant quickly achieved revolutionary great unity through class education.

The working class of Ma'anshan, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on "correctly handling cadres," has established Mao Zedong Thought study classes to solve cadre problems, understood the active thoughts of cadres, recalled bitterness and sweetness with cadres, criticized revisionism and repudiated self, and helped cadres who made mistakes to recognize their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line through Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, a large number of revolutionary cadres have been quickly liberated, allowing them to stand on the front line of "grasping revolution and promoting production" and continue to make new contributions to the people. Wang Qin, the former deputy secretary of the Ma'anshan Party Committee, executed the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and made serious mistakes. With the help of revolutionary masses, he decided to repudiate self and establish public spirit and join the revolution. He has visited more than 20 units under Ma'anshan to examine his mistakes and listen to the criticism of revolutionary masses, earning the general understanding and praise of the broad revolutionary masses, and was elected as the deputy chairman of the municipal revolutionary committee.

The People's Liberation Army executing left-supporting tasks in Ma'anshan has made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Ma'anshan. At the critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in the steel city, they have held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, insisted on the principle of "supporting the left but not supporting factions," and regarded the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the fundamental task of the army's left-supporting work. They have breathed and shared destiny with the steel city workers, from leaders to soldiers, deeply entered grassroots units, and fought self and criticized revisionism with revolutionary masses, eating and living together, having heart-to-heart talks, propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and passing on the excellent traditions of the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style to the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of the steel city. This has effectively promoted the broad masses to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, and develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

    马鞍山工人无限忠于毛主席革命路线  狠抓阶级斗争坚持开展革命的大批判
    全市革命形势空前大好，革命大联合和革命三结合正在进一步巩固和发展
    据新华社合肥二十六日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，我国重要钢铁基地之一的马鞍山市革命形势空前大好，而且越来越好。全市广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众正在沿着毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进，决心夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    在一片大好形势下，马鞍山市革命委员会已在三月十五日胜利诞生。这是安徽省成立的第一个地、市级的革命委员会。市革命委员会的成立，不仅促使马鞍山地区出现了抓革命促生产的新高潮，对全省无产阶级文化大革命运动也起了推动作用。目前，马鞍山市革命大联合和革命三结合正在得到进一步巩固和发展，全市已有一百六十多个基层单位成立了革命的三结合的临时权力机构。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在一九五八年、一九五九年曾两次视察马鞍山地区，并作了极为重要的指示：“马鞍山条件很好，可以发展成为中型钢铁联合企业”，“发展钢铁工业一定要搞群众运动”。无限忠于毛主席的马鞍山工人阶级，遵照毛主席的指示，自力更生，奋发图强，以最快的速度建设起一座崭新的钢铁城市。可是中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人，却千方百计地对抗毛主席的指示，企图在马鞍山复辟资本主义。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，马鞍山革命的主力军工人阶级，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在马鞍山的代理人打得落花流水，立下了不朽的功勋。
    伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示下达后，马钢工人怀着无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚阶级感情，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进。他们在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，坚持大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，到目前为止，全市已举办了三千多个学习班，有十一万多人参加了学习，占全市人口一半以上。在学习班里，他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓阶级斗争，坚持不懈地开展革命大批判，肃清各个领域里的反革命修正主义流毒；同时，狠斗“私”字，消除资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，克服无政府主义。在这场斗争中，苦大仇深的马钢老工人，发挥了很大的作用。他们带头大搞阶级教育，开展“两忆三查”活动。他们还带着青年职工参观马鞍山下的“万人坑”，诉工人阶级在旧社会所受的剥削压迫苦，对青年职工进行两种社会对比的阶级教育，收到了立竿见影的效果。马钢焦化厂原来的两派群众组织，对立情绪相当严重，通过阶级教育，这个厂的两派革命群众很快实现了革命的大联合。
    马鞍山的工人阶级遵照毛主席关于“正确地对待干部”的教导，大办解决干部问题的毛泽东思想学习班，了解干部的活思想，同干部一起忆苦思甜，斗私批修，用毛泽东思想帮助犯了错误的干部认识错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，因而很快解放了一大批革命干部，让他们站到抓革命促生产的第一线，继续为人民立新功。原马钢党委副书记王钦，在无产阶级文化大革命初期，执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了严重错误。他在革命群众帮助下，决心破私立公，起来革命。他先后到马钢所属二十多个单位检讨自己的错误，听取革命群众的批判，得到了广大革命群众的普遍谅解和赞扬，并被推选到市革命委员会担任了副主任委员。
    在马鞍山执行支左任务的人民解放军，对马鞍山的无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大的贡献。在钢城两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持“支左不支派”的原则，把全面落实毛主席最新指示，作为部队支左的根本任务。他们同钢城工人阶级，同呼吸，共命运，从领导干部到战士都深入到基层单位，和革命群众一起斗私批修，同吃同住，促膝谈心，宣传毛泽东思想，把四个第一、三八作风等优良传统传授给钢城无产阶级革命派和革命群众，有力地促进了广大群众克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，发展和巩固了革命大联合和革命三结合。
