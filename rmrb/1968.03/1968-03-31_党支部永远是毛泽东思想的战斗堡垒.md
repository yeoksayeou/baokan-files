The Party Branch is Forever the Battle Fortress of Mao Zedong Thought

“Model Unit for Studying Chairman Mao’s Works” — Red Ninth Company Party Branch Secretary, Qiao Yunqi

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has used his important positions within the Party to vigorously promote the revisionist line of building the Party. In late 1948, at a Party members' congress of the Central Directly Affiliated Organs, he exposed his evil plot by spreading fallacies under the guise of caring for Party members' studies. He said: "Our branch has over 300 Party members. If we all enroll in study classes... this would be a good way to organize the branch, and we would not need to hold small group meetings. Holding study class meetings would be the same as holding Party meetings." He also absurdly claimed: "The Party branch should hold a branch congress once a month, which can be more lively, a one-hour meeting, two hours of performances, everyone likes the club, so we can turn it into a club meeting..." This Chinese Khrushchev wants to turn the Party's grassroots organizations—the branches—into "cultural classes" and "clubs," thereby changing the nature of the Party, fundamentally dispersing the fighting spirit of Party members, and weakening and destroying the fighting role of the Party branch. This is a major plot by the Chinese Khrushchev to seize the Party and the country, and we must not let his wolfish ambitions succeed!

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to the construction of grassroots Party organizations. He taught us long ago: "The Red Army has fought hard and not disintegrated, and 'building the Party branch at the company level' is an important reason." He also taught us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to engage in great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." Our Ninth Company Party branch has learned from practice that the most fundamental aspect of building grassroots Party organizations is to make the Party branch a battle fortress armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and to make Communist Party members models of learning, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's instructions.

Our Party branch places the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. We educate Party members to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao. On the one hand, our Party branch insists on recruiting Party members from among the active elements who study Chairman Mao's works, and on the other hand, it requires every Party member to become an active element in studying Chairman Mao's works. These Party members have the deepest class imprints of eradicating "self-interest" and the most solid roots of planting "public interest." They are open-hearted, loyal, and active, always putting revolutionary interests as their first priority. They are close to the masses, endure hardships first, and are truly advanced elements of the proletariat. These Party members are tightly united around the leadership core of the branch, forming the steel pillars that ensure the company's emphasis on politics. In this way, many excellent soldiers and a large number of red seeds spreading Mao Zedong Thought have been cultivated.

The Party's grassroots organizations are the cells of the entire Party, the link connecting with the masses, the frontline command center for uniting a vast number of Party members and revolutionary masses to charge against the class enemy, and the battle fortress for learning, implementing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to turn our Party's grassroots organizations into "cultural classes" and "clubs," with the intention of removing the soul and lifeline of our Party-building—the great Mao Zedong Thought—and turning Party members into revisionists through laughter and play, ultimately causing the Party branch, this fortress of the proletariat, to disintegrate. If the whole Party follows this path, "it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years at the least, several dozen years at the most, to inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist Party will definitely become a revisionist party, a Fascist party, and the entire China will change color." The Chinese Khrushchev's plot to abolish Party grassroots organizations is extremely poisonous!

We must rise up with the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods spread by the Chinese Khrushchev into smithereens, letting the invincible red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever stand on every Party branch's battlefield.

    党支部永远是毛泽东思想的战斗堡垒
    “学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”党支部书记　乔云歧
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫利用他所窃据的党内重要职务，极力推行修正主义建党路线。一九四八年底他在中央直属机关总支一次党员代表大会上散布的谬论，就是他罪恶阴谋的一次大暴露。
    在这个会上，他打着关心党员学习的旗号，别有用心地说：“我们的总支三百多个党员，如果都编入学习班……这就是支部组织的一个好方式，以后就不开小组会。开学习班的会，也即是开党的会。”他还胡说什么：党支部“一个月开一次支部大会，可以活泼一点，开一个钟头会，演两个钟头戏，大家喜欢俱乐部，就把它变成俱乐部会……。”这个中国赫鲁晓夫就是这样要把党的基层组织——支部变成“文化班”、“俱乐部”，从而改变党的性质，在根本上涣散党员的斗志，削弱和破坏党支部的战斗作用。这是中国赫鲁晓夫篡党、篡国的一个大阴谋，我们绝不能让他的狼子野心得逞！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席历来就十分重视基层党组织的建设，他很早就教导过我们：“红军所以艰难奋战而不溃散，‘支部建在连上’是一个重要原因。”他还教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”我们九连党支部从实践中体会到，基层党组织的建设，最根本的就是使党支部成为用毛泽东思想武装起来的战斗堡垒，使共产党员成为学习、宣传和执行毛主席教导的模范。
    我们党支部把学习毛主席著作放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的位置，教育党员读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。我们党支部一方面坚持从学习毛主席著作积极分子中发展党员，同时，又要求每个党员都成为学习毛主席著作的积极分子。这些党员挖“私”字的阶级烙印最狠，扎“公”字的根子也最牢。他们襟怀坦白，忠实积极，总是以革命利益为第一生命。他们联系群众，吃苦在前，不愧为无产阶级的先进分子。这些党员紧密团结在支部领导核心的周围，形成了保证连队突出政治的钢梁铁柱。这样，就培养了许多优秀的战士和大批传播毛泽东思想的红色种子。
    党的基层组织，是全党的细胞，是联系群众的纽带，是团结广大党员、革命群众向着阶级敌人冲锋陷阵的前线指挥部，是学习毛泽东思想、执行毛泽东思想、宣传毛泽东思想、捍卫毛泽东思想的战斗堡垒。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图把我们党的基层组织变成“文化班”、“俱乐部”，其目的就是要抽掉我们建党的灵魂和生命线——伟大的毛泽东思想，使党员在说笑玩乐中变成修正主义分子，使党支部这个无产阶级的战斗堡垒最后解体。如果全党“照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了”。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图取消党的基层组织的阴谋何其毒也！
    我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把中国赫鲁晓夫散布的反革命修正主义黑货砸个稀烂，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远插在每一个党支部的阵地上。
