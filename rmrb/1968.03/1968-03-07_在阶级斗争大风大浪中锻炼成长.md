In the storms of class struggle, we have been tempered and grown. We, the cadres of a certain service company, have been guided by Chairman Mao's teachings: "The successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution must be tempered in the great winds and storms of the revolutionary struggle." However, the Chinese Khrushchev advocates that Communist Party members should detach themselves from class struggle and engage in idealistic self-cultivation. This can only lead to more revisionism.

Our company's practice has proven that participating in class struggle is the best classroom for us to learn Chairman Mao's thoughts. All our comrades in the company have undergone new tests in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" campaigns, firmly defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Comrade Yu Zhangzhi, during his task of supporting the left, once encountered a student who treated him badly. He was about to get angry, but then he thought that this would fall into the trap of the class enemy. No matter how good his intentions, it would be the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. So, he picked up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" again and continued to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Wang Youyuan, based on the principle of "supporting the left, not the factions," realized that his views and attitude towards one revolutionary organization were incorrect. He then actively went to the students of that faction to make a self-criticism. However, those students did not understand his actions at first and said, "You are supporting factions, not the left." Wang Youyuan was very angry, but when he looked up and saw the portrait of Chairman Mao, he remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and smiled at them, saying, "You see, it is precisely because I have shortcomings that I come to make a self-criticism to you." His actions finally won the understanding of the young comrades. Practice has repeatedly proven that Communist Party members can only become true vanguards of the proletariat by tempering themselves in the storms of class struggle.

    在阶级斗争大风大浪中锻炼成长
    某部勤务连指导员　李俊明
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却鼓吹共产党员脱离阶级斗争去搞唯心主义的修身养性。这样就只能越养越修。
    我们连的实践证明，参加阶级斗争，是我们学习毛泽东思想的最好课堂。我们全连同志在“三支”“两军”中，经受新的考验，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。俞长智同志在执行支左任务中，有一次，一个同学对他态度不好，他要发火，但一想到这样会正中阶级敌人的诡计，不管主观愿望如何，都是对毛主席的最大不忠。于是，他又拿起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，继续宣传毛泽东思想。王友元同志根据
  “支左不支派”的原则，认识到自己对一派革命组织的看法和态度不对时，就主动向这派同学作检查。可是那些同学一开始对他的行动不理解，说：“你支派不支左。”王友元同志心里很生气，一抬头看见毛主席像，想起毛主席的教导，就笑着对他们说：“你看，不就是因为我有缺点才来向你们作检讨吗？”他的这种行动终于取得了小将们的谅解。实践一再证明，共产党员只有在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼自己，才能成为一个真正的无产阶级的先锋战士。
