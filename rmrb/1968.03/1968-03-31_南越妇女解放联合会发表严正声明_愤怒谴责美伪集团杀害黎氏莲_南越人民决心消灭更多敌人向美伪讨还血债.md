The South Vietnamese Women's Liberation Union issued a solemn statement on March 19, strongly condemning the savage act of the American aggressors and their lackeys in brutally murdering Le Thi Lien, a member of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and Vice Chairperson of the South Vietnamese Women's Liberation Union.

The statement said that the desperate American imperialists and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique recently secretly killed Le Thi Lien and many other patriots who were imprisoned by them, committing a new and extremely barbaric crime against the people of South Vietnam.

The statement pointed out that the brutal crimes of the American aggressors and their lackeys can only arouse even greater hatred among the people of all strata in the South.

The people of South Vietnam are determined to make any sacrifice to resolutely eliminate more American aggressors and their lackeys, to avenge Le Thi Lien and other patriotic comrades who were murdered.

Le Thi Lien was arrested by the American puppet forces while on a mission in May of last year and was murdered in Saigon on the night of January 31 this year.
