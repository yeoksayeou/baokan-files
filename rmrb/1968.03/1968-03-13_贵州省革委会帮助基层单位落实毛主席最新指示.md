Following Chairman Mao's great teachings, adhere to the mass line, and improve leadership style. Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee helps grassroots units implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Half of the standing committee members lead a large number of cadres to go to the front line, promote grassroots units to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and promote revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in all regions and units, achieving immediate results.

New China News Agency, Guiyang, March 11 — The Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee has recently taken a series of measures to vigorously promote the rapid and comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in all regions and grassroots units, achieve revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and the situation of the Cultural Revolution in the province is getting better and better. So far, more than 90% of the counties and cities in the province have established revolutionary committees, and some counties have achieved a red tide.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently held a working conference attended by responsible comrades from various prefectures (autonomous prefectures), cities, counties, and provincial-level systems. The conference decided to ride the momentum of the good situation, launch a high tide of achieving revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and quickly achieve a red tide throughout the province to seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

After the conference, half of the standing committee members of the provincial revolutionary committee personally led a large number of cadres to go to various regions and go deep into the front line. Wherever the problems are prominent, they go there. They go to the grassroots level, first explain Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the revolutionary masses, and learn and implement them with the masses, solving problems together, achieving immediate results. Some units have been fighting "internal wars" for more than a year, but after seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and criticizing and repudiating revisionism, they quickly achieved revolutionary unity or revolutionary three-in-one combination. The situation is developing very rapidly.

Members of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, when going deep into the grassroots level, pay special attention to grasping key units and key issues, breaking through one point, summarizing experience, and then immediately promoting it throughout the province, launching a wave of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping. The Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is the first region in the province where all counties have established revolutionary committees; Guiding County in this autonomous prefecture is the first county in the province where all districts and communes have established revolutionary committees. This autonomous prefecture and Guiding County have done a good job in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, boldly liberating cadres, and quickly achieving revolutionary unity. The provincial revolutionary committee immediately summarized their experience and promoted it, and called on the whole province to learn from them. The industrial, commercial, financial, agricultural, and forestry systems of the province, as well as the Zunyi, Qiannan, and Xingyi prefectures (autonomous prefectures) and counties, have all expressed their determination and taken measures to launch a wave of learning from the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and Guiding County. In recent days, more than ten counties, including Dushan, Duyun, and Daozhen, have all established revolutionary committees in their districts and communes.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The provincial revolutionary committee, based on Chairman Mao's great instruction, on the one hand, adopts the "going down" method to vigorously promote grassroots units to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions; on the other hand, adopts the "inviting up" method, inviting the responsible comrades of the two factions of the grassroots units that have been fighting "internal wars" for a long time to come to the province to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes and specially solve these "hard-to-solve" problems. The members of the revolutionary committee, because they go deep into the grassroots level, understand the situation, grasp the living thoughts, and grasp the main contradictions, therefore, the two methods of holding study classes have achieved good results, and many problems have been solved. The two revolutionary mass organizations in Longjiang County have been fighting "internal wars" for more than a year because of factionalism. The responsible comrades of these two revolutionary mass organizations participated in the study class held by the provincial revolutionary committee, fought against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthened proletarian party spirit, quickly achieving revolutionary unity and establishing a united committee, laying a solid foundation for establishing a three-in-one combination temporary power organ. At present, more than ten thousand study classes of various types have been held in various places in Guizhou Province. The province basically achieves the goal of revolutionary committees holding classes, revolutionary mass organizations holding classes, rural areas holding classes, and industrial and mining enterprises holding classes. Study classes have been set up in car teams traveling on the Guizhou Plateau, on remote sheep-grazing mountains, and even in courtyards where the learning atmosphere was previously poor. These study classes have laid a solid ideological foundation for consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and achieving revolutionary three-in-one combination, and have powerfully promoted the new high tide of grasping the revolution and promoting production throughout the province.

　　遵照毛主席的伟大教导，坚持群众路线，改进领导作风
　　贵州省革委会帮助基层单位落实毛主席最新指示
　　半数常委带领大批工作人员深入第一线，推动基层单位大办毛泽东思想学习班，促进各地区各单位实现革命大联合和革命三结合，收到立竿见影的效果
    新华社贵阳十一日电　贵州省革命委员会最近采取一系列措施，大力促进各地区和各基层单位迅速全面落实毛主席的最新指示，实现革命大联合和革命三结合，全省文化大革命形势越来越好。到目前为止，全省已有百分之九十以上的县、市建立了革命委员会，有的县实现了一片红。
    在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，贵州省革委会不久前召开了有各专区（自治州）、市、县和省级各系统的负责人参加的工作会议，决定乘大好形势的东风，掀起一个实现革命大联合、革命三结合的高潮，尽快地实现全省一片红，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    会后，省革委会有半数常委亲自带领大批工作人员，分赴各地区，深入第一线，哪里问题突出就到哪里去。他们到基层，首先向革命群众宣讲毛主席的最新指示，并和群众一起学习，一起落实，一起解决问题，收到了立竿见影的效果。有的单位打了一年多“内战”，经过认真学习毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，很快就实现了革命大联合或革命三结合。形势发展十分迅速。
    贵州省革命委员会的成员深入基层，十分注意抓重点单位，抓关键性问题，突破一点，总结经验，然后立即在全省推广，掀起比、学、赶、帮的热潮。黔南布依族苗族自治州是全省第一个全州各县都建立了革委会的先进地区；这个自治州的贵定县，又是全省第一个全部区、社都建立了革委会的先进县。这个自治州和贵定县在全面落实毛主席最新指示，大办毛泽东思想学习班，大胆解放干部，迅速实现革命大联合等方面，都做得较好。省革命委员会立即总结他们的经验加以推广，并号召全省向他们学习。省工交、财贸、农林等各系统，以及遵义、黔东南、兴义等专区（自治州）、县纷纷表决心，订措施，掀起了向黔南布依族苗族自治州和贵定县学习的热潮。连日来，已有独山、都匀、道真等十多个县的区、社全部建立了革命委员会。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”省革命委员会根据毛主席这一伟大指示，一方面采取“走下去”的方法，大力推动各基层单位举办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示；一方面采取“请上来”的方法，把长期打“内战”的地区或单位的两大派群众组织负责人，请到省里来，参加毛泽东思想学习班学习，专门解决这些“老大难”问题。革委会的成员由于深入基层，了解下情，抓住了活思想，抓住了主要矛盾，因此，这两种办学习班的方法，效果都很好，许多问题迎刃而解。榕江县两派革命群众组织，因为派性作怪，打了一年多“内战”。这两派革命群众组织的负责人参加省革委会举办的学习班学习，狠斗资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，很快实现了革命大联合，成立了大联合委员会，为建立三结合临时权力机构打下了坚实的基础。现在，贵州省各地举办的各种类型的学习班已达十万多个，全省基本上做到各级革委会办，革命群众组织办，农村办，工矿企业办。行驶在贵州高原上的汽车队，偏僻的牧羊山上以及过去学习气氛较差的家庭院落里，都办起了一个个学习班。这些学习班为巩固和发展革命大联合、实现革命三结合，打下了坚实的思想基础，并有力地推动了全省抓革命、促生产的新高潮。
