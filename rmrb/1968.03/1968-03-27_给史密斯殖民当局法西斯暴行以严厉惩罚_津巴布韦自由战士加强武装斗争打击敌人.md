The Zimbabwean freedom fighters have intensified their armed struggle, giving the Smith fascist colonial regime a severe punishment for recently killing five Zimbabwean freedom fighters.

According to a statement issued by the Zimbabwe African National Union on March 22 in Dar es Salaam, the Zimbabwe African National Union Liberation Army, in a fierce battle with the colonial forces of South Rhodesia and South Africa, killed twenty-five enemies and wounded more than fifty. The statement said that despite the intensified repression by the Smith fascist regime, the activities of the Zimbabwean freedom fighters have continued to expand in scale.

According to a message from Lusaka on March 19, Zimbabwean freedom fighters engaged in a battle near the Karoi region, ninety miles from the Zambian border, killing eighteen South Rhodesian colonial soldiers.

From March 18 to 20, the Zimbabwe African National Union forces killed twelve South Rhodesian colonial soldiers and wounded fourteen.

On March 21, the Zimbabwean guerrillas fought against the South Rhodesian military and police, who were equipped with helicopters and reconnaissance planes, in the Zambezi River Valley. According to reports, the guerrillas killed two enemies and wounded eight.

On the night of March 17, the armed forces of the Zimbabwe African National Union engaged in a firefight with the South Rhodesian security forces forty miles west of Makuti, killing seven enemies and seriously injuring three.

According to a message from the New China News Agency in Dar es Salaam, George Magombe, the Executive Secretary of the Liberation Committee of the Organization of African Unity, said in a speech on the Tanzanian radio on March 21: "The only way for Zimbabwe to gain freedom is to take up arms."

Magombe said, "Zimbabwe is the Zimbabwe of Africa, and Africa is the Africa of Africans!"

He added, "The Africans recently hanged by the Smith fascist regime will not die in vain. They died for the freedom and dignity of Africans. Now, as we mourn them, we must avenge their deaths. We should spare no effort to complete the cause for which they sacrificed their lives."

    津巴布韦自由战士加强武装斗争打击敌人
    新华社二十三日讯 津巴布韦自由战士加强了武装斗争，给予最近杀害五名津巴布韦自由战士的史密斯法西斯殖民当局以严厉的惩罚。
    据津巴布韦非洲民族联盟二十二日在达累斯萨拉姆发表的公报说，津巴布韦非洲民族联盟解放军在同南罗得西亚和南非殖民军队的一次激战中，打死二十五个敌人，打伤五十多。公报说，尽管史密斯法西斯政权加紧进行镇压，但津巴布韦自由战士的活动规模却一直在扩大。
    据卢萨卡十九日消息，津巴布韦自由战士在离赞比亚边境九十英里的卡罗伊地区的一次战斗中，打死十八名南罗得西亚殖民军。
    三月十八日至二十日，津巴布韦非洲民族联盟部队打死十二名南罗得西亚殖民军，打伤十四名。
    三月二十一日，津巴布韦游击队在赞比西河河谷同配备有直升飞机和侦察机的南罗得西亚军警交战，据报道，游击队打死敌人二名，打伤八名。
    三月十七日晚，津巴布韦非洲民族联盟武装部队在马库蒂以西四十英里同南罗得西亚治安部队交火，打死敌人七名，重伤三名。
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　非洲统一组织解放委员会执行秘书乔治·马贡贝二十一日在坦桑尼亚电台发表讲话时说：津巴布韦赢得自由的唯一道路是拿起枪杆子。
    马贡贝说：“津巴布韦是非洲的津巴布韦，而非洲是非洲人的非洲！”
    他接着说，最近被史密斯法西斯政权绞死的非洲人不会白白地死去。他们是为维护非洲人的自由权利和尊严而死去的。他说：“现在当我们哀悼他们的时候，我们一定要为他们的死难报仇，我们应该不惜任何代价完成他们为之献身的事业。”
