March 19 is Vietnam National Anti-American Struggle Day. Eighteen years ago today, the heroic Vietnamese people opened a glorious chapter in their history of struggle against American imperialism.

At that time, the French colonialists suffered heavy defeats in their war of aggression against Vietnam. The claws of American imperialism extended into Vietnam, actively supporting the French colonialists in prolonging and expanding the war of aggression, and attempting to seize the opportunity to replace France in its colonial position in Vietnam. On March 18, 1950, American imperialism openly dispatched two warships and seventy fighter planes to Saigon, and deployed several aircraft carriers in the sea from Da Nang to Vung Tau, conducting a "show of force" in an attempt to intimidate the Vietnamese people.

This blatant act of aggression by American imperialism further aroused the fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people. That night, the Vietnamese armed forces launched a fierce attack on the American warships docked in Saigon harbor. On the morning of March 19, tens of thousands of people in Saigon-Cholon bravely took to the streets, holding a massive demonstration. They shouted slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" "American imperialism get out!" and tore up the American flag, chasing after American sailors. The demonstrators, despite the enemy's use of tanks, armored vehicles, and tear gas for suppression, marched forward courageously and hoisted the national flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam high above the streets. At the same time, students, workers, and others in Saigon went on strike, boycotted classes, and shut down businesses. The anti-American tide swept through the city, forcing the two American warships to sneak out of Saigon harbor that very night. This was a historic victory for the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialist aggression. From then on, the Vietnamese people never stopped fighting, carrying forward the spirit of the March 19 struggle, overcoming all difficulties, and resolutely fighting for independence and freedom.

To commemorate this glorious day, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and the Vietnam Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Committee jointly decided on March 17, 1958, to designate March 19 of each year as Vietnam National Anti-American Struggle Day.

Today, in the war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation, the Vietnamese people have fully carried forward the glorious revolutionary fighting tradition, fearlessly confronting the enemy, daring to struggle, and daring to win. They have fully demonstrated the power of people's war, pushing the American aggressors to the brink of disaster, and creating a brilliant example of a single country resisting and defeating American imperialist aggression since the end of World War II. They have set a shining example for the struggle of oppressed peoples and nations around the world to achieve liberation.

　　“三·一九”越南全国反美斗争日
    三月十九日是越南全国反美斗争日。十八年前的这一天，英雄的越南人民在反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争的史篇上揭开了光辉的一页。
    当时，法国殖民者在侵略越南的战争中遭到惨重失败，美帝国主义的侵略魔爪伸进了越南，积极支持法国殖民者延长和扩大侵略战争，并且企图乘机取代法国在越南的殖民地位。一九五○年三月十八日，美帝国主义又公然派遣两艘军舰和七十架战斗机到西贡，并在岘港到头顿的海面上部署了几艘航空母舰，进行“武力示威”，妄图威胁越南人民。
    美帝国主义这种明目张胆的侵略行动，更加激起了越南人民的高昂斗志。当天夜间，越南人民武装力量迎头痛击停泊在西贡港的美国军舰。三月十九日上午，西贡—堤岸数十万人民勇敢地冲上街头，举行了声势浩大的示威游行，他们高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义滚回去！”等口号，并撕毁了美国国旗，追击美国水兵。参加游行的群众不顾敌人用坦克、装甲车、催泪弹进行镇压，英勇地前进，并把越南民主共和国的国旗高悬在大道上。同时，西贡的学生、工人等纷纷罢课、罢工、罢市。反美浪潮席卷全市，迫使两艘美国军舰当晚就从西贡港口悄悄溜走。这是越南人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中取得的具有历史意义的胜利。从此，越南人民一刻也没有停止过斗争，他们发扬“三·一九”英勇斗争的精神，排除一切艰难困苦，坚决争取独立和自由。
    为了纪念这一光辉的日子，越南祖国战线中央委员会和越南亚非人民团结委员会，在一九五八年三月十七日联合决定，把每年的三月十九日定为越南全国反美斗争日。
    今天，越南人民在抗美救国战争中，大力发扬光荣的革命斗争传统，不畏强敌，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，极大地发挥了人民战争的威力，使美国侵略者陷入灭顶之灾，创造了第二次世界大战以后一个国家单独抗击和战胜美帝国主义侵略的光辉典范，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争树立了光辉的榜样。（新华社）
