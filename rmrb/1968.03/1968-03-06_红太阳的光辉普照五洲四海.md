The radiance of the red sun shines over the five continents and four seas. The sun of the East shines with brilliant rays, and people across the five continents sing with joy. Dear Chairman Mao, you are the banner of the times, the hope of humanity, the symbol of victory, and the beacon of progress. You are the red sun in the hearts of all revolutionary people around the world. Revolutionary people around the world love and admire you. People around the world praise you with the most beautiful words and follow you with unwavering faith, determined to forge a new world of red.

In Search of the Precious Book from Afar

A few days after the New Year, the second officer, Mania, of the Greek ship "Captain George" docked in our port, woke up early. He was beaming with excitement as he examined the Mao badge on the chest of our staff on duty and the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in his hand, enthusiastically shouting, "Mao Zedong—the teacher!" "The little red book—the precious book, the guiding light."

A few days earlier, as soon as the ship anchored, Mania rushed to the sailors' club and said to our staff, "Chinese friends, I want the most precious book in the world—Mao Zedong's book."

He said eagerly, "To find a Greek version of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' I have been to several ports and still couldn't find it. Mao Zedong's book is more precious than any treasure." To meet Mania's urgent request, our staff finally found a Greek version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and gave him this precious book. Mania, who was busy working, jumped with joy as soon as he saw the book he had been longing for day and night. He immediately rushed to our staff and shook their hand tightly, saying, "Great! I finally got this most precious book."

He took out a handkerchief and wiped his hands over and over again, then carefully took the red book and pressed it to his heart.

He said, "Mao Zedong is the great teacher, leader, commander, and helmsman of the proletarian revolution. In the contemporary world, there is nothing greater than him and his outstanding works. I will apply Mao Zedong's words to practice."

Chairman Mao's Health is the Greatest Happiness for the World's People

Recently, the Japanese ship "Daifengmaru" docked in our port. A sailor on this ship has an unbounded love for Chairman Mao. For several days in a row, he stood in front of the giant portrait of Chairman Mao hanging at the port, gazing at it for a long time.

Once, our staff, Lao Liang, was taking a walk in the sailors' club, wearing a shiny Mao badge on his chest. Just then, this Japanese sailor was standing in front of the display window of Mao's works. As soon as he turned around and saw Lao Liang's Mao badge, he quickly walked up to Lao Liang, gesturing with his hands to ask for the Mao badge. Lao Liang personally pinned the badge on his chest. He immediately stood at attention, his eyes filled with happy excitement, and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" He said, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the world's people. We Japanese people love Chairman Mao the most. Only Mao Zedong Thought can save Japan."

The next day, we visited his dormitory and workshop. Inside, there were several color photos of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards. Among them, there was a photo of Chairman Mao smiling and waving to the Red Guards, which he particularly liked. He said, "I look at this photo every day. Whenever I see Chairman Mao waving his mighty hand, we gain the courage and confidence to fight against difficulties and enemies." He also said, "Chairman Mao's health is the greatest happiness for all the people in the world."

I Will Forever Sing the Praises of Mao Zedong

"In the East, the red sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong..." This moving song resonates across the five continents and echoes in every corner of the world.

Last year, on one day, in the Dutch port of Rotterdam, a manual worker in the suburbs, with an exceptionally excited heart, came to our country's "Yumen" ocean-going ship and said to our crew, "Chinese friends, I really want to get a copy of the Chinese record 'The East Is Red.' Yesterday, I heard from an old friend who works at the port that your ship is docked in our port. Today, I came from a very distant suburb early in the morning, just to get this record." He said, "I have seen Chinese movies and heard this song praising the great leader Mao Zedong. We all want to learn it. My children, wife, and I sing this song every day. I also want to teach more people to sing 'The East Is Red' and forever sing the praises of Mao Zedong."

However, because the "The East Is Red" records brought by our sailors had been taken by foreign friends in other ports, we could only apologize to this old worker and promise to bring it to him next time. The worker left his address and asked the Chinese friends not to forget. He said, "When we sing this song and think of Mao Zedong, we see the hope of the world."

Mao Zedong Thought is Our Lifeline

Not long ago, our country's "Zhenjiang" ocean-going ship docked in the port of Pointe-Noire in Congo (Brazzaville). Many Congolese (Brazzaville) friends, with boundless love for Chairman Mao's works in their hearts, shouted "Mao Zedong Waya (long live)!" and asked our sailors for the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Among them, many people are illiterate, but they said: Mao Zedong's book is our lifeline. The world's people want to gain liberation and happiness, they must read Mao Zedong's book. We are illiterate, we can ask our children who can read or literate people to read it to us.

Once, our sailors prepared to give Mao badges and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to Congolese (Brazzaville) friends. These Congolese (Brazzaville) friends were overjoyed and cheered. They immediately ran to the water tank, washing their hands clean and brushing off the dust on their bodies. They spontaneously lined up, waiting for this happy moment to arrive. When our sailors gave them the Mao badges and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" one by one, they always bowed respectfully and held the Mao badges and red books high above their heads, repeatedly shouting "Mao Zedong Waya!" "Mao Zedong Waya!"

Mao Zedong Thought Will Surely Illuminate the Whole World

Once, a team of our sailors played a soccer match with Romanian friends in a stadium in the Romanian port of Constanta. Many Romanian friends, upon hearing this news, eagerly sought opportunities to come to our sailors and enthusiastically shouted:

"Mao Zedong—the Lenin of our times!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Wish Chairman Mao a long life!" A worker from a nearby machinery factory walked up to our sailors, shook their hands, and said, "We are delighted to see that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories. We people are very concerned about China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Because this revolution is a revolution that shakes the world and makes the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries tremble." After the match, he escorted our sailors back to the ship and asked for a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He said, "Now, an anti-China trend has emerged in the world, which is a symbol of the enemy's approaching death. Facts have proven that the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought in the world makes the days of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism even worse. We firmly believe that in this new era, the enemy will surely fail, and the great Mao Zedong Thought will surely illuminate all of Europe and the world."

    红太阳的光辉普照五洲四海
    东方的太阳光芒万丈，五洲四海纵情歌唱。敬爱的毛主席，您是时代的旗帜，人类的希望，胜利的象征，前进的灯塔；您是全世界革命人民心中的红太阳。全世界革命人民热爱您，敬仰您；全世界人民用最美好的语言歌颂您，以坚定的信心跟着您，誓要闯出一个红彤彤的新世界。
    不远万里寻宝书
    元旦过后的一天早晨，停泊在我海港的希腊“乔治船长号”轮船的二副玛尼亚很早就起床了。他满面春风，异常激动地端详着我登轮执勤的工作人员胸前的毛主席像章和手中红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，热情地欢呼“毛泽东——导师！”“小红书——宝书、明灯。”
    前几天，这艘轮船一抛锚，玛尼亚就跑到海员俱乐部对我工作人员说：“中国朋友，我要世界上最珍贵的宝书——毛泽东的书。”
    他怀着十分迫切的心情说：“为了找到一本希腊文版的《毛主席语录》，我跑过了好几个港口都找不到。毛泽东的书比珍宝还珍贵千倍万倍。”为了满足玛尼亚迫切的要求，我工作人员终于找到了一本希腊文版的《毛主席语录》，把这本宝书赠给他。正在忙着干活的玛尼亚，一见到这日夜盼望的宝书，高兴得跳了起来，马上飞奔到我工作人员面前，紧紧地握住我工作人员的手说：“太好了！我终于得到了这本最珍贵的宝书。”
    他掏出手绢来，把手擦了一遍又一遍，然后小心翼翼地接过这本红书，贴在心坎上。
    他又说：“毛泽东是无产阶级革命的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手。当代世界上再没有什么比他和他的杰出著作更伟大的了。我要把毛泽东的话应用到实践中去。”
    毛主席身体健康
      是世界人民的最大幸福
    最近，日本“大丰丸”轮船在我海港停泊。这艘轮船的一位海员无限热爱毛主席。一连几天，他都走到高挂在海港前的毛主席巨幅画像面前仰望很久很久。
    有一次，我工作人员老梁在海员俱乐部散步，胸前戴着一个金光闪闪的毛主席像章。刚巧这位日本海员站在毛主席著作橱窗前，当他转身发现老梁胸前的毛主席像章后，赶忙走近老梁面前，比划着手势，索取这枚毛主席像章。老梁亲手把这枚像章佩戴在他胸前，他马上立正，两眼充满着幸福的激情，高呼
  “毛主席万岁！”他说：“毛主席是世界人民心中的红太阳，我们日本人民最热爱毛主席。只有毛泽东思想才能救日本。”
    第二天，我们参观了他的宿舍和工作室。里面张贴着几幅毛主席接见红卫兵的彩色照片。其中有一幅是毛主席神采奕奕向红卫兵招手的照片，他特别喜欢，他说：“我每天都要看一看这幅照片，一见到毛主席挥动巨手，我们就有了向困难和敌人斗争的勇气和信心。”他又说：“毛主席的身体健康，是全世界人民最大的幸福。”
    我要永远歌颂毛泽东
      “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”。这动人心弦的颂歌，响彻五洲四海，回荡在世界的每一个角落。
    去年的一天，在荷兰的鹿特丹港，有一个在郊区干杂活的手工业工人，怀着异常激动的心情，来到停泊在港口的我国“玉门号”远洋轮上，对我船员说：“中国朋友，我很想得到一张《东方红》的中国唱片。昨天，我从一位在港口工作的老朋友口中得知你们的轮船在我们港口停泊。今天一早，我就从很远的郊区赶来，为的是得到这张唱片。”他又说，“我看过中国电影，听到过这首歌颂伟大领袖毛泽东的歌，我们都想学会它。我和我的孩子、妻子天天都唱这个歌，我还想教会更多的人，让大家都唱《东方红》，永远歌颂毛泽东。”
    可是，因为我海员带来的《东方红》唱片，早被其他港口的外国朋友要光了。因此，只得向这位老工人抱歉，答应下次来一定带给他。这位工人留下了地址，并嘱中国朋友千万不要忘记。他说：“唱起这首歌，想起毛泽东，就看到了世界的希望。”
    毛泽东思想是我们的命根子
    不久以前，我国“镇江号”远洋轮船在刚果（布）的黑角港停泊。许多刚果（布）朋友怀着对毛主席著作无限热爱的心情，高呼“毛泽东奥耶（万岁）！”向我海员索取红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。他们中间很多人不识字，可是他们说：毛主席的书是我们的命根子，世界人民要获得解放和幸福，必须读毛泽东的书。我们不识字，可以叫我们念书的孩子或识字的人念给我们听。
    有一次，我海员准备把毛主席像章和《毛主席语录》送给刚果（布）朋友，这些刚果（布）朋友乐得欢呼雀跃。他们立即跑向清水池边，把手洗得干干净净，把身上的灰尘拍了又拍。不约而同地排好队，等候着这个幸福时刻的到来。当我海员挨个地赠给他们毛主席像章和《毛主席语录》时，他们总是恭恭敬敬地行礼，并把毛主席像章和红宝书高举在头上，不断高呼“毛泽东奥耶！”“毛泽东奥耶！”
    毛泽东思想定将照亮全世界
    有一次，一队我国海员在罗马尼亚的康斯坦萨港一个足球场和罗马尼亚朋友赛球。许多罗马尼亚朋友得知这个喜讯，纷纷寻找机会到我海员面前热情地高呼：
  “毛泽东——当代的列宁！”“毛泽东万岁！”“祝毛泽东主席万寿无疆！”有一个在附近一家机械厂工作的工人，走到我海员面前握住我海员的手说：“我们高兴地看到，中国文化大革命已经赢得了巨大的胜利。我们人民很关心中国文化大革命。因为这次革命，是一场使全世界震动，使帝修反丧魂失魄的大革命。”球赛完毕后，他把我海员一直送到船上，并向我海员索取了一本《毛主席语录》。他说：“现在世界上出现了一股反华逆流，这是敌人走向死亡的象征。事实证明，毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播，使美帝苏修的日子越来越不好过了。我们坚信，在这崭新的时代里，敌人一定要失败，伟大的毛泽东思想定将照亮全欧洲、全世界。”梁大年  叶植辉
