	Study Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's words,
	Act on Chairman Mao's instructions, be a good soldier of Chairman Mao
	—Congratulating the Successful Opening of the First Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works at the Higher Military Academy

	The representatives attending the conference are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are determined to make the conference a Mao Zedong Thought study class, firmly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and swearing to be revolutionaries who will carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	The representatives, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on rectifying the party's organization, and fiercely criticize the revisionist line of building the party advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev.

	The advanced collective attending the conference—the entire revolutionary staff of the printing plant—thoroughly smashed the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents to obstruct the printing of Chairman Mao's works, overcame numerous difficulties, and finally printed the red revolutionary treasure book. This is the revolutionary staff expressing their boundless love for Chairman Mao by binding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

	—Congratulating the Successful Opening of the First Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works at the Political Academy of the Liberation Army

	"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, carrying out the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The active learners of Chairman Mao's works attending the conference have deep class feelings for the great teacher Chairman Mao and always, in everything, and in every situation, act according to Mao Zedong Thought. This is them studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" seriously.

	Chairman Mao said: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the great alliance of revolution, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. This must be resolved." The active learners of Chairman Mao's works attending the conference, in their "supporting agriculture" work, together with the cadres of the production brigades and the responsible persons of revolutionary mass organizations, study how to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	The conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works is held as a Mao Zedong Thought study class. The representatives, with a heart of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, fiercely fight against selfishness and establish selflessness, sparking a revolution in their souls and promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts.
