In the spring of last year, at the crucial moment when the proletarian revolutionary masses united to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, Chairman Mao taught us: "In places and units where it is necessary to seize power, the policy of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power organ. The name of this power organ should be the Revolutionary Committee." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new stage; at the same time, they have also pointed out a clear direction and goal for the construction of the Revolutionary Committee. After more than a year of struggle, we deeply feel that the most essential and core issue of the Revolutionary Committee is to carry out the revolution. Revolution, first of all, must be led by Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out the ideological revolutionization of the leading cadre team, and to build the Revolutionary Committee into a steadfast stronghold of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao.

The "three-in-one combination" must be combined on the red line of Mao Zedong Thought

In February last year, the county established a "three-in-one combination" Revolutionary Committee. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, we encountered a most prominent problem: although the "three-in-one combination" was combined organizationally, it was not truly combined ideologically. The personnel came from various sides, and their spiritual states were different. There were many active thoughts. Some revolutionary youngsters regarded themselves as "old rebels," thinking that only they were "leftist" and "revolutionary," liking to hear praise and not being able to accept others' criticism and different opinions. Some revolutionary leading cadres who joined the combination, due to insufficient understanding of the criticism they received from the masses in the previous period, were afraid that no one would listen to them and that work would be difficult, and therefore, dared not take responsibility and dared not insist on principles. Faced with these problems, the comrades from the county military department who participated in the "three-in-one combination" also had a sense of difficulty for a time.

At that time, it was precisely the critical moment when Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line was in a decisive battle with the capitalist reactionary line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. Class struggle was extremely sharp and complex, and a series of serious struggle tasks were placed before us. If the state of the leading cadre team was not changed quickly, it would not be possible to faithfully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and it would be impossible to stand at the forefront of the movement to lead the masses to continue to advance.

Faced with this situation, some leading cadres of the county Revolutionary Committee first studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, analyzed the causes, and studied ways to solve the problem. They realized that the ideological estrangement between the revolutionary youngsters and the revolutionary leading cadres was caused by the capitalist reactionary line, which built a "wall" and dug a "trench." Only by using Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon to thoroughly criticize the capitalist reactionary line, could this "wall" be demolished and this "trench" be filled, truly uniting on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Then, all members of the Revolutionary Committee further studied Chairman Mao's great instructions on the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and his great teachings: "We all come from the four corners of the country, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." After studying, the representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations and the revolutionary leading cadres who participated in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ unanimously agreed: we have a common enemy, common interests, and a common goal of struggle. In the past, it was the capitalist reactionary line that separated us, and today it is Mao Zedong Thought that has brought us together again. We must jointly ensure that the proletariat exercises power well. On this basis, some leading members of the Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on "conducting heart-to-heart talks is a good method," carried out in-depth, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work, one by one, untangling the knots in comrades' minds.

Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee and former Deputy Secretary of the County Committee, Comrade Li Changren, after standing out, was afraid to contact the masses for a period of time. After comrades had heart-to-heart talks with him, he expressed his active thoughts. He said: "I have executed the capitalist reactionary line in the past, and now I have no prestige among the masses. Will they listen to me?" After several heart-to-heart talks, he gradually changed from fear to daring, from passive to active, and his relationship with the masses gradually became closer, and his prestige also increased.

Comrade Yu Cai, a member of the Revolutionary Committee, is a revolutionary pioneer who has fought against the capitalist reactionary line. However, he often saw more mistakes and shortcomings in the revolutionary leading cadres who stood out, and saw fewer advantages and merits. Therefore, he could not take an active and enthusiastic attitude towards the revolutionary leading cadres. When we had heart-to-heart talks with him, we repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, helping him to view cadres comprehensively and historically. Later, he often had heart-to-heart talks with cadres, increasing mutual understanding, and being able to correctly view cadres. In the process of thoroughly criticizing the capitalist reactionary line, we also fiercely fought against our selfish desires. Standing member and former county magistrate Zhang Yunhai, after standing out, consciously regarded himself as a target, regarding his past mistakes as negative examples, actively exposing his selfish desires and criticizing them in large and small meetings. The more he criticized his selfish desires, the more he tasted the sweetness; the more he tasted the sweetness, the more he fought against his selfish desires. Everyone said: "The 'three-in-one combination' must truly be combined on the red line of Mao Zedong Thought, and must have a revolution in the depths of the soul and thoroughly transform the worldview."

We deeply feel that the process of ideological combination is the process of using Mao Zedong Thought to purge the poison of the capitalist reactionary line, and it is also the process of having a revolution in the depths of one's soul and fiercely fighting against the "selfish" desires. The more thoroughly the capitalist reactionary line is criticized, the more thoroughly the "selfish" desires in one's mind are fought against, the deeper the understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the more solid the ideological combination will be. Only such a Revolutionary Committee will truly be united and cohesive, and it can ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fully playing the role of the temporary power organ.

Production and work are complex and varied, but the fundamental issue must be firmly grasped

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, there were many things to do, many tasks to accomplish, and many problems to solve. With so many things to do, how should we prioritize? This question was sharply presented to us.

At that time, it was approaching the busy spring planting season. Some cadres reflected: "We have been focusing on the revolution for more than a year, and now we have established the Revolutionary Committee. We should mainly focus on production." Others said: "The key to the year lies in the spring, and spring is the critical moment for agricultural production. Nothing is more important than focusing on the seedlings. If the seedlings cannot be focused on, everything will be ruined."

Many comrades in the Revolutionary Committee realized that this was a dangerous sign. Production must be focused on, but the question is how to focus on it. Is it to "focus on the revolution and promote production," or just to focus on production? This is not a simple scheduling issue, nor is it a general work method issue. It reflects the direction that the Revolutionary Committee insists on, the path it takes, and the power it exercises. We thought of a serious lesson from the past 17 years of political construction: under the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, under the control of a handful of capitalist roaders within the original county committee, the old county committee and the county people's committee did not emphasize proletarian politics, did not study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and did not focus on the ideological revolutionization of the people. In fact, it became a "production office." The reactionary fallacies advocated by a handful of capitalist roaders within the province, such as "the county is to focus on agricultural production, and if agricultural production is focused on, it is politics," had a wide influence. Now, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party have been overthrown, but their influence on political ideology has not been thoroughly purged, and the old habits are still very stubborn. Some cadres, although deeply educated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have not yet completely broken with the past. If we do not remain vigilant, we will go astray. We deeply felt that the Revolutionary Committee must not go down the old path again and must thoroughly block it. The new power organ of the Revolutionary Committee, what is new about it? In a thousand ways, it is new in establishing Mao Zedong Thought and insisting on using Mao Zedong Thought to lead in all work; it is new in insisting on the socialist direction and taking the path of emphasizing proletarian politics. This is the fundamental direction and path of the proletariat exercising power, and it is also the fundamental direction and path for the new power organ to lead various fronts in carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The proletariat exercises power, which is to grasp the commanding power of political ideology. Grasp this, and you grasp the fundamentals, and you can bring everything into motion. Grasp this power well, and you have everything; otherwise, you lose everything.

At that time, we convened a meeting of the standing committee of the Revolutionary Committee, first studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and Vice Chairman Lin's series of instructions on emphasizing politics, and then analyzing the situation in the countryside. We believed that the most urgent problem to be solved was not the problem of production technology and production arrangements, but the problem of people's ideology. Everyone realized that among the most important things, the most important thing is to grasp the factor of people, to grasp ideological revolutionization, and to grasp the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, at the four-level cadre meeting, we spent most of the time studying Chairman Mao's works and the letter from the Central Committee to all poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres nationwide, carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle. Revolutionary leading cadres and former county magistrate Zhang Yunhai comrade took the lead in inspecting himself and carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle at the meeting. Rural grassroots cadres also actively exposed their thoughts and unburdened themselves, turning the production arrangement meeting into a meeting of criticizing selfish desires and criticizing revisionism. Everyone reflected: "This meeting is unusual, emphasizing politics and grasping ideology; unburdening oneself, eliminating grievances, and feeling light and happy, full of strength." In the past, such meetings were always about asking for money and materials, arguing endlessly, like a trade fair. This time, the meeting had no money and no materials, but it had Mao Zedong Thought, clarified the direction, greatly boosted morale, and many problems could be solved easily.

In the past, when leading cadres went to the countryside for work, it was often "money first" and "materials first." As a result, the more cadres stayed there, the less production increased, and the more capitalist spontaneous forces developed. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, everyone thoroughly criticized this practice. Former county magistrate Zhang Yunhai comrade, the masses said: he went down to work, where he went, money went; where he stayed, it collapsed. Two years ago, he went to the 93rd Brigade for work, lending the brigade 18,000 yuan, but the yield per mu decreased by 30 jin compared to the previous year. Last year, after he stood out, through studying Chairman Mao's works and carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, his understanding greatly improved. He said: "Whether or not to emphasize proletarian politics is a matter of whether or not to take the socialist road." Last summer, he went to the 93rd Brigade for work again. Arriving there, he first organized the masses to study the "Three Articles," taking "criticizing selfish desires and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline from beginning to end, focusing on the ideological revolutionization of the people, resulting in a change in people's ideology and a change in the appearance of the land, with the yield per mu increasing by 48 jin. The masses said: "The former 'god of wealth' has become a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, staying for work left us with capitalist ideology, and this time, staying for work left us with an indelible propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought."

In this way, we further realized that the new power organ is called the Revolutionary Committee mainly because it holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizes proletarian politics, and focuses on the ideological revolutionization of the people. A county with tens of thousands of people has a thousand tasks for the Revolutionary Committee, with different work priorities at different times, but as long as it firmly grasps the emphasis on proletarian politics, thoroughly criticizes bourgeois ideology, establishes Mao Zedong Thought, and carries out the ideological revolutionization of the people, especially the ideological revolutionization of the leading cadre team, it grasps the fundamentals of the fundamentals.

For the proletariat to exercise power, it must always be under the supervision of the masses

Not long after the establishment of the Zhaozhou County Revolutionary Committee, a responsible person from a mass organization of the Agricultural Bureau had opinions on the personnel arrangements of the Revolutionary Committee, posting a big-character poster criticizing the Revolutionary Committee for not taking the mass line and questioning "Is the Revolutionary Committee revolutionary?" This big-character poster caused a great response within the Revolutionary Committee, with some welcoming it and others opposing it. The opposing comrades said: "This is malicious," "it is directing the spearhead at the Revolutionary Committee and the Military Department." Why did such a big-character poster cause such a great shock within the Revolutionary Committee? After analysis, we believed that it was because we had power, our status had changed, and we could not accept the masses' criticisms and could not bear them. We realized that this was another dangerous signal. Chairman Mao taught us: "Let people speak, the sky will not fall, and one will not collapse. If people are not allowed to speak, then one may collapse one day." Several responsible comrades of the Revolutionary Committee sat down and re-studied Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, methods, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, realizing that: in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, relying on the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses; after seizing power, to complete the arduous tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, we also need to rely on the revolutionary spirit of the masses. The masses dare to actively criticize and supervise the Revolutionary Committee, which is an important guarantee for us to always keep the power in the hands of the proletariat.

Everyone's understanding improved, and they became more conscious of accepting the masses' criticisms and supervision. Moreover, they increasingly felt that: to continuously promote the ideological revolutionization of the leading cadre team, to make the Revolutionary Committee always be revolutionary, and to be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, not for a moment can we do without the supervision of the broad revolutionary masses. For example: we several main responsible comrades have tight work, and many cadres and masses request to meet and help solve problems. We often have people looking for us in the office, waiting for us at home, and stopping us on the road. This is a normal phenomenon in the revolutionary period. However, we sometimes had the thought of being bothered, feeling that it was noisy all day, considering to quickly restore "normal" order, set up a framework for the organ, and spread out a stall, with personnel in their respective positions. For this matter, we avoided the masses, closed the door, and held many meetings, but the problem was still not solved. At this time, some masses, because they could not find us, had opinions. Some masses commented that we were: "New organ, old ideas; new team, old style." Some masses criticized the leading cadres of the Revolutionary Committee for "riding in cars when going out, sitting on the stage during meetings, not moving materials with their hands, and gesturing a lot." The masses' criticisms sounded the alarm for us. We thought: being bothered, not wanting to be close to more masses, would restore the order of the organ, and talk about etiquette. What kind of order should be restored? Is it called order just to set up the framework of the organ, sit down, and stay in the office? What is the difference between this order and the order of the original county committee and county people's committee organ? Thinking of these problems, we deeply felt that "restoring order" was still nostalgic for the old order of being an official and a lord. Restoring such an old order is to restore the old, and it will bury the revolution. This is a reflection of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads in the new situation.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Do not be infected with the bureaucratic style," and also taught: "We communists are not to be officials, but to make revolution." Being an official and a lord, the revolutionary youngsters will become ephemeral figures; the revolutionary leading cadres will turn to their opposites; the new power organ will go astray. The power seized by the proletariat may be lost again. At that time, we based on the masses' criticisms, focusing on the issue of "restoring order" and talking about etiquette, carried out rectification within the leading core, checked ourselves in front of the masses, and welcomed the masses to further criticize. In this way, everyone further realized that the new temporary power organ is not new in a sign, new in organizational form, or new in changing a few cadres; it is new in establishing Mao Zedong Thought, new in "not being officials but making revolution," and new in wholeheartedly serving the people and diligently serving as the people's servants.

The broad revolutionary masses heard and saw that their criticisms and supervision of the Revolutionary Committee had an effect, and they spread it among themselves. They became more concerned about state affairs and increased their sense of responsibility for supervising the work of the Revolutionary Committee. Now, the gate and corridor of the Revolutionary Committee often have big-character posters with criticisms or suggestions. Just the day before the New Year, the revolutionary masses also posted a big-character poster at the gate of the Revolutionary Committee. This big-character poster sent four quotations from Chairman Mao and raised four criticisms. It criticized us for not fully implementing the Central Committee's instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in rural areas; it criticized us for leading cadres often saying one thing but doing another. We were very moved after reading it, believing that this was the result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution raising the political awareness of the masses, and it was the greatest concern and love of the masses for the Revolutionary Committee.

We encourage the revolutionary masses to criticize and supervise the Revolutionary Committee, and after tasting the sweetness, some comrades proposed: just welcoming the masses to come to the door to give opinions is still a "defensive battle," not an "offensive battle." To fight an "offensive battle," one must actively go to the masses, be with the masses, and create conditions for the masses to further supervise. Therefore, the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee, especially the standing members, often go to the masses in groups, on the one hand, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; on the other hand, checking our shortcomings and mistakes in work, and listening to the masses' criticisms. Standing member and deputy political commissar of the Military Department, Comrade Li Yue, heard that a few students from Hongwei Middle School had opinions about him and wanted to "shell" him. He went to the "shelling" and actively held a symposium with those few students, soliciting opinions, and sincerely made self-criticism. In this way, the masses said: "The Revolutionary Committee is indeed revolutionary. In the past, the old county committee controlled by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party only criticized others and never made self-criticisms, let alone solicited opinions from the masses." Now, the main responsible comrades of our Revolutionary Committee do not have separate fixed offices, and their pockets are their desks. During the day, they live among the masses, and in the evening, they often walk around and talk. Where there is a problem, they solve it there, and they talk to whoever has a problem. We do this, and the masses say: "Leave Mao Zedong Thought behind, solve the problem, and take the opinion away."

We also had ideological struggles in doing this. Some comrades once worried that placing a power organ that manages the party, government, finance, and culture of the whole county under the supervision of the masses, allowing the masses to criticize when they want to, post big-character posters when they want to, and check themselves in front of the masses when there are shortcomings and mistakes, would this not lose authority? The facts proved that this worry was unnecessary. On the contrary, only by truly placing it under the supervision of the masses, daring to often propose criticisms to it, this power organ is truly representative of the masses and has authority. Because we want the authority of the proletariat, not the "official" authority of the bourgeoisie. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, wholeheartedly serving the people, and being the people's servants, is to have authority; maintaining close ties with the masses, accepting the masses' supervision, and representing the interests of the masses, is to have authority. The masses dare to propose their opinions and actively supervise the work of the Revolutionary Committee, which shows that the masses believe in and love this power organ; it proves that the masses do not regard the Revolutionary Committee as a bureaucratic organ above themselves, but as an organ for their own affairs; they do not regard the cadres as superiors, but as representatives of the people. This is the most important sign that the Revolutionary Committee has established its own authority. Some comrades were concerned that placing the Revolutionary Committee under the supervision of the masses would not foster the anarchist thoughts that exist among some masses? Our experience is: on the contrary, we often go deep into the masses, encourage the masses to criticize and supervise the work of the Revolutionary Committee, and we can also timely discover the different ideological tendencies that appear in the masses at different times, making it easier to help them overcome them early. Especially because the Revolutionary Committee has established close ties with the masses, the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ has established authority in the hearts of the masses, and the broad masses support the Revolutionary Committee, when various ideological tendencies appear among the masses, the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee only need to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and carry out in-depth, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work, the masses will also be more willing to accept. Therefore, in a sense, placing the Revolutionary Committee under the supervision of the masses also creates favorable conditions for educating the masses, raising their awareness, overcoming anarchist thoughts, and petty-bourgeois and bourgeois factionalism.

Now, many revolutionary leading cadres deeply feel: "In the past, various errors were made, with many reasons, and one of the most important reasons was violating Chairman Mao's teachings on closely connecting with the masses and listening to the masses' opinions. In the future, to prevent the power from changing color and individuals from changing quality, we must rely on Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought to guide the direction from above, and rely on the masses' supervision from below."

Chairman Mao taught us: "The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not done well, the restoration of capitalism is a possibility at any time." Through a year of struggle practice, we further realized the correctness, greatness, and correctness of Chairman Mao's teachings. We deeply feel that: the victory of seizing power is not the end of the struggle, but the beginning of a new struggle. We must only hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, never forget to emphasize proletarian politics, establish Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the ideological revolutionization of the people, and fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, can we fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the new year, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and ensure that the proletarian dictatorship will never change color.

　　把革命委员会建成无限忠于毛主席的坚强战斗堡垒
　　——关于“三结合”的临时权力机构掌好权用好权的几点体会
　　沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会代表  黑龙江省肇州县革命委员会主任委员  县人民武装部第二政治委员  田玉和
    去年春天，当无产阶级革命派联合起来向党内一小撮走资派夺权的关键时刻，毛主席教导我们：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”毛主席的这一最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命推进到一个崭新的阶段；同时，也为革命委员会的建设指出了明确的方向和奋斗的目标。经过一年多的斗争实践，我们深深体会到：革命委员会，最本质、最核心的问题是要革命。革命，首先要用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好领导班子的思想革命化，把革命委员会建成无限忠于毛主席的坚强战斗堡垒。
    “三结合”要结合在毛泽东思想的红线上
    肇州县在去年二月间建立了“三结合”的革命委员会。革命委员会建立以后，我们碰到一个最突出的问题，就是“三结合”虽然从组织上结合起来了，但思想上并没有真正结合起来。人员来自各个方面，精神状态各不相同，有不少活思想。有些革命小将以“老造反”自居，唯我独“左”，唯我独“革”，喜欢听表扬，听不进别人的批评和不同意见。有些结合进来的革命领导干部，由于对前一段受到群众的批评认识不够，担心说话没人听，工作不好干，因此，不敢大胆负责，不敢坚持原则。在这些问题面前，县武装部参加“三结合”的同志一时也产生了畏难情绪。
      当时，正是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线决战的关键时刻，阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂，一系列严重的斗争任务摆在我们面前。领导班子的这种状态，如果不迅速改变，就不能忠实执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就无法站在运动的前面领导群众继续前进。
    面对这种情况，县革命委员会的部分领导骨干，首先学习毛主席的有关指示，分析原因，研究解决的办法。他们认识到：革命小将和革命领导干部之间存在的思想隔阂，是资产阶级反动路线造成的，是这条反动路线筑起的“墙”，挖成的“沟”。只有用毛泽东思想这个强大的思想武器，狠批资产阶级反动路线，才能拆掉这堵“墙”，填平这条“沟”，真正在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来。然后，革命委员会的全体成员又进一步学习毛主席关于革命“三结合”的伟大指示，学习“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了”的伟大教导。经过学习，参加“三结合”临时权力机构的革命群众组织代表和革命领导干部一致认为：我们有共同的敌人，共同的利害关系，共同的奋斗目标。过去是资产阶级反动路线把我们隔开了，今天是毛泽东思想又把我们结合起来了。我们一定要共同为无产阶级掌好权、用好权。在这个基础上，革命委员会的部分领导成员又遵照毛主席关于“开展谈心活动这个办法很好”的教导，进行深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作，一个一个地解开同志们思想上的疙瘩。
    革命委员会副主任、原县委副书记李长仁同志，站出来之后，在一段时间里“怕”字当头，不敢接触群众。经过同志们跟他谈心，他谈出了自己的活思想。他说：“我过去执行过资产阶级反动路线，现在在群众中没有威信，说话人家能听吗？”经过多次谈心，终于使他逐渐由怕变敢，由被动转为主动，和群众的关系逐渐密切了，威信也提高了。
    革命委员会成员于才同志是在同资产阶级反动路线斗争中冲杀出来的革命闯将。但是，他对站出来的革命领导干部，往往看他们过去犯的错误和存在的缺点多，看他们的长处和优点少。因此，对待革命领导干部不能采取积极支持和热情帮助的态度。我们在同他谈心时，反复宣传毛主席的干部政策，帮助他全面地历史地看待干部。后来，他经常找干部谈心，增强了彼此的了解，能够正确地对待干部。我们在大破资产阶级反动路线的过程中，也狠斗了自己的私心杂念。常委、原县长张云海，从站出来之后，自觉地把自己当靶子，把过去犯的错误作为反面教材，主动在大会、小会上亮私斗私。越斗私，越尝到甜头；越有甜头，斗私的劲头越大。大家说：“三结合要真正结合在毛泽东思想的红线上，必须在灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底改造世界观。”
    我们深深体会到：思想结合的过程，就是用毛泽东思想去肃清资产阶级反动路线流毒的过程，也是在自己的灵魂深处爆发革命、狠斗“私”字的过程。对资产阶级反动路线批得越透，对自己头脑里的“私”字斗得越彻底，对毛主席革命路线理解得越深，思想上的真正结合也就越牢。这样的革命委员会，才会真正是统一的、团结的，才能保证毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利贯彻执行，充分发挥临时权力机构的作用。
    生产、工作千头万绪要紧紧抓住根本
    革命委员会建立后，很多事情要办，很多工作要做，很多问题要解决。千头万绪抓什么，怎样抓？这个问题尖锐地摆在我们面前。
    当时，正是接近春耕大忙季节。有些干部反映：“抓革命抓了一年多，现在已经建立了革命委员会，应该主要抓生产了。”还有的说：“一年之计在于春，春季是农业生产的关键时刻，什么也比不上抓苗重要。如果苗抓不上去，啥都完了。”
　　 革命委员会的许多同志发觉这是一个危险的苗头。生产是要抓紧的，问题是怎样抓，是“抓革命，促生产”，还是就生产抓生产？这不是一个简单的安排问题，也不是一般的工作方法问题，而是反映了革命委员会坚持什么方向，走什么道路，掌什么权的问题。我们想到十七年来政权建设的一个严重的教训，就是在中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线的影响下，在原肇州县委内一小撮走资派的控制下，旧县委、县人委不突出无产阶级政治，不活学活用毛主席著作，不抓人的思想革命化，实际上成了个“生产办公室”。我省党内一小撮走资派贩卖的“地、县就是抓农业生产，农业生产抓上去了，就是政治”等反动谬论，流毒很广。现在，党内一小撮走资派被打倒了，但是，他们在政治思想上的影响，还远没有肃清，旧的习惯势力还很顽强。有些干部虽然在无产阶级文化大革命中受到深刻的教育，但是同过去那一套还没有彻底决裂，如果不提高警惕，就会走到邪路上去。我们深深地感到：革命委员会决不能再走这条老路，必须彻底堵死它。革命委员会这个新的权力机构，到底新在什么地方呢？千新万新，就是新在大立毛泽东思想，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅上；新在坚持社会主义方向，走突出无产阶级政治的道路上。这是无产阶级掌权的根本方向和道路，也是新的权力机构领导各条战线进行斗批改的根本方向和根本道路。无产阶级掌权，就是要掌政治思想上的这个统帅权。抓住这个，就抓住了根本，就能把一切都带动起来。掌好这个权，就有了一切；否则，就丧失一切。
    当时，我们就召开了革命委员会常委会议，首先学习毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导和林副主席关于突出政治的一系列指示，然后分析农村的情况，认为：最需要解决的不是生产技术和生产安排问题，而是人的思想问题。大家认识到：千重要，万重要，抓人的因素，抓思想革命化，抓活学活用毛主席著作最重要。于是，在四级干部会议上，我们用大部分时间学习毛主席著作和中央给全国贫下中农和农村干部的一封信，开展革命大批判。革命领导干部、原县长张云海同志在会上带头检查自己，带头进行革命大批判。农村基层干部也纷纷亮思想，卸包袱，生产安排会变成了斗私批修会。大家反映：“这次会，不寻常，突出政治抓思想；卸包袱，扫怨气，轻松愉快浑身长力量。”过去开这样的会，总是伸手要钱要物，争论不休，象个交易会。这次开会，没有钱没有物，但是有了毛泽东思想，明确了方向，大长了志气，许多问题就可以迎刃而解。
    过去领导干部下乡蹲点，常常是“金钱挂帅”、“物质挂帅”。结果，干部越在那里蹲点，生产越上不去，资本主义自发势力越发展。建立革命委员会后，大家彻底批判了这种做法。原县长张云海同志，群众议论说：他下去蹲点，人到哪钱到哪，蹲到哪哪就垮。前年他到九三大队蹲点，给大队贷款一万八千元，可是亩产却比前一年减少了三十斤。去年他站出来之后，通过学习毛主席著作和进行革命大批判，认识有了很大提高。他说：“突出不突出无产阶级政治，实质是走不走社会主义道路的问题。”去年夏天，他又到九三大队蹲点，到了那里，他首先组织群众学习“老三篇”，自始至终以“斗私，批修”为纲，抓人的思想革命化，结果人换思想地换貌，亩产增加四十八斤。群众说：“往日的‘财神爷’，变成了毛泽东思想宣传员。过去蹲点给我们留下的是资本主义思想，这回蹲点给我们留下个不走的毛泽东思想宣传队。”
    这样，就使我们进一步认识到，新的权力机构之所以叫革命委员会，主要就是因为它高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，抓人的思想革命化。一个县有几十万人口，革命委员会的工作千头万绪，不同时期有不同的工作重点，但是，只要是紧紧抓住突出无产阶级政治，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，搞好人的思想革命化，首先是领导班子的思想革命化，就是抓住了根本中的根本。
    为无产阶级掌权要永远置于群众监督之下
    肇州县革命委员会建立不久，农业局一个群众组织的一位负责人，对革命委员会人事安排有意见，贴出一张大字报，批评革命委员会不走群众路线，质问“革命委员会是不是革命的”？这张大字报在革命委员会内部引起很大反响，有的欢迎，有的反对。反对的同志说：“这是别有用心”，“是把矛头指向革命委员会，指向武装部。”为什么这样一张大字报在革命委员会内部会引起这样大的震动呢？经过分析，我们认为：就是因为掌了权，地位变了，对群众的批评意见听不进，受不了了。我们发觉这又是一个危险的信号。毛主席教导我们：“让人讲话，天不会塌下来，自己也不会垮台。不让人讲话呢？那就难免有一天要垮台。”我们革命委员会的几个负责同志坐下来，重新学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，认识到：在无产阶级  文化大革命运动中，我们向党内一小撮走资派夺权，依靠的是广大群众的革命精神；夺权后，要完成繁重的斗批改任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，也需要依靠群众的革命精神。群众敢于主动地对革命委员会提出批评意见，进行监督，这正是使我们的政权永远掌握在无产阶级手中的重要保证。
    大家的认识提高了，对于接受群众的批评、监督也就更自觉了。而且越来越感觉到：要不断地促进领导班子的思想革命化，要使革命委员会永远是革命的，是忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的，就一时一刻也离不开广大革命群众的监督。如：我们几个主要负责同志，工作比较紧张，许多干部、群众要求见面帮助解决问题。我们经常是在办公室里有人找，回到家里有人在等，走在路上也有人拦。这本来是革命时期的一种正常现象。但是，我们有时闪出怕麻烦的思想，觉得整天乱哄哄的，考虑要快些恢复“正常”秩序，支起个机关的架子，铺开个摊子，人员各就各位。为了这件事，我们躲开群众，关上门开过多次会，问题始终解决不了。这时，有些群众由于找不到我们，就有了意见。有的群众议论我们是：“新机关，旧思想；新班子，旧作风。”有的群众则批评革命委员会的领导干部“出门坐汽车，开会台上坐，材料不动手，指手划脚多。”群众的批评，给我们敲起了警钟。我们就想：怕麻烦，不愿接近更多的群众，就要恢复机关化的秩序，讲排场。究竟要恢复的是什么样的秩序呢？难道把机关的架子搭起来，人员坐下来，办公室里一呆，这就叫秩序吗？这同原来的县委、县人委机关的秩序有什么两样呢？想到这些问题，使我们深深感到，“恢复秩序”就是头脑里还留恋过去做官当老爷的旧秩序。恢复这样的旧秩序，就是复旧，就将葬送革命。这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争在新形势下的一种反映。
    毛主席教导我们：“不要沾染官僚主义作风”，又教导说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。做官当老爷，革命小将就将变成昙花一现的人物；革命领导干部就将走向自己的反面；新的权力机构就将走到邪路上去。无产阶级夺得的政权，将有可能重新丧失掉。当时，我们就根据群众的批评意见，抓住“恢复秩序”和讲排场这个问题，在领导核心中进行整风，在群众面前进行检查，并欢迎群众进一步提出批评。这样就使大家进一步认识到：新的临时权力机构，不是新在一块牌子上，新在组织形式上，新在换几个干部上；而是新在大立毛泽东思想上，新在“不是要做官，而是要革命”上，新在全心全意为人民服务，勤勤恳恳当人民的勤务员上。
    广大革命群众耳闻目见自己对革命委员会的批评、监督起了作用，互相传诵，他们更加关心国家大事，更加增强了监督革命委员会工作的责任感。现在，革命委员会的大门口和走廊上经常出现批评或建议的大字报。就在今年过元旦的前一天，革命群众还在革命委员会的大门口贴上一张大字报。这张大字报送了四条毛主席语录，提出四条批评意见。批评我们贯彻中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的指示没有条条落实；批评我们领导干部常常说到了却做不到。我们看了十分感动，认为这是无产阶级文化大革命提高了群众的政治觉悟的结果，是群众对革命委员会最大的关心和爱护。
    我们鼓励革命群众对革命委员会进行批评、监督，尝到甜头后，有些同志就提出：光是欢迎群众上门提意见，还是打的“防御战”，不是打“进攻战”。要打“进攻战”，就要主动深入到群众中去，和群众在一起，给群众创造进一步进行监督的条件。因此，我们革命委员会的同志，首先是常委，经常分头到群众中去，一方面，宣传毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势；一方面检查我们工作中的缺点和错误，听取群众的批评。常委、武装部副政委李月同志，听说红卫中学有几名同学，对他有意见，要“炮轰”他。他就迎着“炮声”上，主动去请那几名同学开座谈会，征求意见，诚恳地作了自我批评。这样一来，群众就说：“革命委员会确实是革命的，过去，党内一小撮走资派控制的旧县委尽整别人，什么时候也没作过自我批评，更不要说到群众中征求意见了。”现在我们革命委员会的主要负责人都没有单独固定的办公室，背兜就是办公桌。白天生活在群众之中，晚间经常到处走一走，看一看，谈一谈。哪有事在哪办，谁有问题找谁谈。我们这样做，群众说是：“把毛泽东思想留下来，把问题解决了，把意见带走了。”
    我们这样做，不是没有思想斗争的。有的同志曾经担心，把一个掌管全县党政财文大权的权力机构，置于群众监督之下，群众愿批评就批评，想贴大字报就贴大字报，有了缺点、错误，还要在群众面前检查，这不就没有权威了吗？事实证明，这种担心是多余的。恰恰相反，只有真正置于群众监督之下，群众敢于经常对它提出批评意见，这个权力机构才是真正代表群众的，才是有权威的。因为，我们要的是无产阶级的权威，不是资产阶级的“官”威。照毛主席的指示办事，全心全意为人民服务，当人民的勤务员，才有权威；和群众保持血肉的联系，接受群众的监督，代表群众的利益，才有权威。群众有了意见敢于提出来，对革命委员会的工作积极进行监督，正是说明群众相信、热爱这个权力机构；证明群众把革命委员会不看成是凌驾在自己头上的官僚机关，而是看成为自己办事的机构；不是把干部当成上司，而是当作人民的代表。这是革命委员会已经建立了自己的权威的最重要的标志。还有的同志顾虑，革命委员会置于群众监督之下，这不正好助长了部分群众存在的无政府主义思想吗？我们的体会是：恰恰相反，我们经常深入到群众中去，鼓励群众对革命委员会的工作进行批评、监督，也就能及时发现群众中不同时期出现的不同思想倾向，便于及早帮助他们克服。特别是由于革命委员会同群众建立了较密切的联系，“三结合”的临时权力机构在群众心目中建立了权威，广大群众对革命委员会是拥护的，群众中产生了这样那样思想倾向，革命委员会的同志只要遵照毛主席的教导，进行深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作，群众也就容易接受。因此，从某种意义上说，把革命委员会置于群众监督之下，也正为教育群众、提高群众的觉悟，克服无政府主义思想和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，创造了有利条件。
    现在，许多革命领导干部，深有感触地说：“过去犯了这样那样的错误，有多种原因，其中很重要的一条就是违背了毛主席关于密切联系群众、倾听群众意见的教导。今后，要使政权不变色，个人不变质，上靠毛主席、毛泽东思想指引方向，下靠群众的监督。”
    毛主席教导我们说：“革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。”通过一年来的斗争实践，使我们进一步认识到毛主席这一教导无比英明、无比伟大、无比正确。我们深深体会到：夺权的胜利，并不是斗争的结束，而是新的斗争的开始。我们只有高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，大立毛泽东思想，搞好人的思想革命化，充分发挥广大群众的革命积极性，才能在新的一年中条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，才能保证无产阶级政权永远不改变颜色。
