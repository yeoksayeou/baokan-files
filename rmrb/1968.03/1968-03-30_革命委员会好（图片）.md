The most fundamental aspect of the Revolutionary Committee being excellent in every way is to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts actively and well. All members of the Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee in Jiangxi Province, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, held the first study session after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee at the site where Chairman Mao conducted a cadre training class in 1929—Wenchang Palace in Xingguo County. They studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Pay Attention to Methods of Work." Contributed by Jiangxi Daily.

The Revolutionary Committee has shown vigorous vitality in leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against class enemies. The Lankao County Revolutionary Committee in Henan Province has always directed its spearhead at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents. This is the poor and lower-middle peasants of Sanyi Township, denouncing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the "three selfs and one package" in the countryside, vowing to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and ensuring that the socialist iron mountain remains red for generations. Contributed by Henan Daily.

Members of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Revolutionary Committee in Guizhou Province, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, see for themselves, adhere to the mass line, consult the masses on everything, and be the students of the masses," have gone deep into the grassroots to seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This is Comrade Feng Yuqiu, a standing committee member of the prefecture Revolutionary Committee, deputy commander of the military sub-district, and an old Red Army soldier, explaining Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the stories of Red Army soldiers' loyalty to Chairman Mao to the revolutionary youngsters.

The Revolutionary Committee has its own new revolutionary style and institutions that benefit the people. Leaders of the Shenyang Bearing Factory Revolutionary Committee pay attention to maintaining a frugal and simple style, staying connected with the masses, and actively working with revolutionary masses to focus on revolution and promote production, striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a member of the factory Revolutionary Committee (center) working in the lathe workshop and checking the quality of the processed parts with the workers.

"In a certain sense, the most intelligent and most talented are those with the most practical experience." The Beijing Knitting Factory Revolutionary Committee is loyal to Chairman Mao's great teachings, determined to be the students of the masses. They take workers as their teachers, using the methods of "going out" and "inviting in" to actively seek opinions and humbly learn from the masses, which has been warmly welcomed and supported by the worker masses. This is the members of the Revolutionary Committee lining up to invite worker masses to a study class to share their experiences in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Photographed by Xinhua News Agency reporter.

The revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership team integrates the "three-eight" spirit of the People's Liberation Army, the hardworking and pioneering qualities of the working people, and the fine tradition of our Party's connection with the masses. "Being both an official and a common person." Members of the Qingdao City Revolutionary Committee often go deep into factories, rural areas, and ports, working with workers and peasants to resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology.

    革命委员会千好万好，最根本的一条，是要活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想。江西省兴国县革命委员会的全体委员，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，在毛主席一九二九年举办过干部训练班的地方——兴国县城文昌宫，举行革命委员会成立后的第一次学习会，学习毛主席光辉著作《为人民服务》和《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》。　江西日报供稿
