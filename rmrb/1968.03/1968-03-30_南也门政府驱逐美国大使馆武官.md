The People's Republic of South Yemen government has declared the U.S. military attaché to South Yemen, Perry, an "undesirable person" and ordered him to leave the country within a specified time. On the morning of the 28th, this American military attaché, who had been engaged in conspiratorial activities in South Yemen, left the young Arab country in disgrace.

When this American military attaché arrived at Aden Airport early on the 28th, many Arabs glared at him angrily. A airport official said, "You American, get out of here forever!"

A South Yemeni youth said, "The American imperialists are causing trouble everywhere in our country and around the world. Now we have given this American imperialist a lesson. The heroic Vietnamese people are fighting back against the American imperialists with guns and cannons."

An official from the South Yemeni government told a reporter, "We detest the activities this American has been conducting in our country."

    南也门政府驱逐美国大使馆武官
    新华社亚丁二十八日电　南也门人民共和国政府宣布美国驻南也门大使馆武官佩里为“不受欢迎的人”，并勒令他限期离境。二十八日清晨，这个在南也门进行阴谋活动的美国武官灰溜溜地离开了这个年轻的阿拉伯国家。
    当这个美国武官二十八日一早来到亚丁机场时，许多阿拉伯人用愤怒的目光怒视着这个美国佬。一位机场负责人说：“你这个美国佬，给我永远从这里滚出去！”
    一位南也门青年说：“美帝国主义者在我国和世界各地到处捣乱。现在我们教训了这个美帝国主义分子。英雄的越南人民正在用枪炮打击美帝国主义者。”
    南也门政府的一位官员对记者说：“我们厌恶这个美国家伙在我们国家所进行的活动。”
