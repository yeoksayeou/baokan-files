The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission announced on the 25th that another so-called low-yield nuclear test had been conducted at the Nevada Test Site.

According to reports, the U.S. imperialists have conducted multiple nuclear tests since the beginning of this year. This once again exposes the fact that the so-called "non-proliferation treaty" planned by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism is a complete fraud. Under the cover of this so-called treaty, the U.S. is continuing to develop nuclear weapons, attempting to engage in nuclear blackmail against the revolutionary peoples of the world.

    美帝进行核试验加紧发展核武器
    美国原子能委员会在二十五日宣布，在内华达试验场又进行了一次所谓低爆炸力的核试验。
    据报道，自今年以来美帝国主义已多次进行核试验。这再次戳穿了美帝苏修筹划的所谓“防止核扩散”条约是一个彻头彻尾的骗局。在这个所谓条约的掩盖下，美帝正继续发展核武器，妄图对世界革命人民进行核讹诈。
