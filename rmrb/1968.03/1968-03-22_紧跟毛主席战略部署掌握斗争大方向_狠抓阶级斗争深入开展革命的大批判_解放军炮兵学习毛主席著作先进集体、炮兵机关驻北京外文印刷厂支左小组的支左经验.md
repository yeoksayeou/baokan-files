The PLA Artillery Unit stationed at the Beijing Foreign Language Printing Factory and the revolutionary workers and cadres of the factory, with an infinite loyalty to the great teacher Chairman Mao, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's March 7th directive and a series of latest instructions. They quickly achieved revolutionary great unity based on production teams. In September last year, they established a revolutionary committee, gradually united more than 95% of the masses and cadres, completed organizational reforms, and are now focusing on rectification to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The factory's appearance has undergone a fundamental change, and everywhere is a scene of revolutionary fervor. Production has steadily increased, reaching a new level never seen before. Last year, they completed the national production plan ahead of schedule, printing nearly ten million copies of Chairman Mao's works in dozens of foreign languages, surpassing the total number of foreign language editions of Chairman Mao's works printed in the 16 years since the factory was established. They sent these powerful spiritual atomic bombs to the revolutionary people in more than 140 countries and regions around the world. The most important experience of this support-left group is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to grasp class struggle, and to carry out a continuous and in-depth revolutionary criticism to promote the implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions.

Revolutionary criticism promotes revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination

In March last year, when this support-left group entered the factory, it was at a critical moment of fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. At that time, the struggle was complicated, and the two factions were seriously opposed to each other. How to unite the revolutionary masses?

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In studying any process, if it is a complex process involving two or more contradictions, we must concentrate our efforts on finding its principal contradiction." The support-left personnel, following Chairman Mao's teachings, conducted investigations and carefully analyzed the situation at that time. They believed that the reason the two factions were seriously opposed to each other was the evil result of China's Khrushchev and his agents implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. The contradiction between the broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and China's Khrushchev and his agents was the principal contradiction. This was the concentrated expression of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, an enemy-versus-us contradiction. The current situation arose because the struggle against the enemy had been relaxed. Only by firmly grasping this principal contradiction, carrying out revolutionary criticism, fully exposing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents, and exposing their plot to incite the masses to fight each other, could the two factions be united to jointly fight the enemy. Therefore, they organized the two factions to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution, and it is also the primary question of the cultural revolution." They guided everyone to direct the struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents. The facts revealed by the criticism showed that the black hands of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee had reached into the Foreign Language Printing Factory. They fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought and vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. China's Khrushchev even had his wife, Wang XX, control the power of this factory, using every means to limit the printing of foreign language editions of Chairman Mao's works, while printing large quantities of the black "Self-Cultivation," turning this factory into a stronghold for spreading counter-revolutionary revisionist poison overseas. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they, in order to protect themselves, deceived the masses and incited the masses to fight each other. Through revolutionary criticism, everyone's awareness was raised, and their eyes were opened. The revolutionary rebels said: "We and the deceived masses are like melons on the same vine; we are all victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are our common enemy. We must concentrate our firepower to fight and expose the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party." The deceived masses said: "In the past, we did not look at problems from a class perspective and fell for the tricks of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. We must join the revolutionary rebels to firmly fight against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party." In this way, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory quickly united, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on achieving revolutionary great unity by system.

After achieving revolutionary great unity, the support-left personnel assisted in liberating the cadres. At this time, a new problem arose. Everyone had different views on the cadres. The support-left group conducted a comprehensive analysis of the cadres in this factory and believed that the majority of the cadres were good or relatively good. The differences among the masses regarding the cadres were mainly the evil result of the bourgeois reactionary line's "striking a large area and protecting a small area." To properly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, it was necessary to carry out revolutionary criticism, making everyone distinguish between Chairman Mao's cadre policy and line and the revisionist cadre policy and line. They first organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on cadre issues and then launched a criticism of the revisionist cadre line. They organized mid-level and above cadres to hold more than ten small criticism meetings and factory-wide criticism meetings. Many cadres actively participated in the struggle, thereby making the cadres "appear" in the criticism and educate themselves in the criticism. Revolutionary masses also grasped Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues in the criticism, identified the cadres, and helped revolutionary leading cadres stand out. For example, regarding the former deputy secretary of the Party committee, some wanted to overthrow him, while others wanted to protect him. In the criticism, he firmly stood on the side of the revolutionaries and engaged in a face-to-face struggle with the capitalist-roaders within the factory's Party, exposing the inner workings of the factory's Party capitalist-roaders implementing China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line. At the same time, he actively examined his own mistakes, gaining the understanding of the masses. Everyone unanimously recognized him as a revolutionary leading cadre and elected him as the deputy director of the factory's revolutionary committee.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." This support-left group, through repeated practice, felt that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line was developed in the struggle against China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line. To implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, it is necessary to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out continuous and in-depth revolutionary criticism, and to severely criticize the bourgeois reactionary line in various fields, eliminating its poison.

Revolutionary criticism promotes the revolutionary committee to firmly walk the path of emphasizing politics

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In places and units that need to seize power, the policy of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat." How to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions? As soon as the factory revolutionary committee was established, the support-left group studied with the members of the factory revolutionary committee and clearly understood that this temporary power organ must be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, and make a resolution on grasping the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and never forgetting class struggle.

However, in actual work, some comrades sometimes deviated from the path of emphasizing politics and unconsciously emphasized business. The support-left group and the factory revolutionary committee believed that this was mainly due to the lingering poison of the revisionist management system long promoted by China's Khrushchev. Therefore, they launched a factory-wide criticism of the revisionist management system. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres used big-character posters, small-character posters, blackboard newspapers, and broadcasts, through large and small meetings, fully exposing the crimes and harm of the revisionist management system, and criticizing it item by item with Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone saw more clearly in the criticism that China's Khrushchev's revisionist management system was extremely poisonous, with the most poisonous being the opposition to studying Chairman Mao's works and the opposition to emphasizing proletarian politics. They promoted material incentives and bonus systems to corrupt the souls of the workers. The workers said: "These are the sugar-coated bullets shot at us by China's Khrushchev, using soft knives to kill people, serving their evil purpose of restoring capitalism." Through revolutionary criticism, everyone further realized that: The newly established revolutionary committee must always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics to lead the broad revolutionary masses to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and ensure that the country will never change color.

After raising their awareness, the factory revolutionary committee more consciously put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work, establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which have been held more than sixty times with over nine hundred people participating. They established the system of reporting in the morning and summarizing in the evening, daily reading, and study days. The factory is full of classrooms for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and battlefields for criticizing and transforming oneself. Everyone studies Chairman Mao's works, and everyone cares about class struggle. The factory revolutionary committee led all revolutionary workers to resist interference from the right and the ultra-left, always directing the struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents, thoroughly eliminating all "chameleons" and "small insects." In one workshop, class enemies used bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to incite struggles among the masses. In the past, some comrades regarded this as factional struggle. The support-left group and the comrades of the factory revolutionary committee studied Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle together, using class analysis to analyze the reality of struggle in this workshop. They believed that the factional struggle in this workshop was instigated by class enemies using the banner of "revolution" and the slogan of "revolution," utilizing some comrades with heavy factionalism. The factory revolutionary committee led the masses to expose the "chameleons" after which the situation in this workshop changed dramatically. The broad masses united, and the revolution and production presented a new situation.

Revolutionary criticism strongly promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation in this unit

The support-left group helped the factory revolutionary committee to grasp revolutionary criticism, promoting the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with increasingly clear thoughts and increasingly broad paths. They promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation in this unit through revolutionary criticism.

They closely linked revolutionary criticism with the situation, tasks, and ideological reality. In criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line, they first severely criticized the crimes of the factory's Party capitalist-roaders in implementing this revisionist line. Each workshop and team also organized small meetings to criticize according to ideological reality. In some teams where the poison of slavery was deep, they repeatedly criticized slavery. In some teams where the poison of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage" was deep, they repeatedly criticized the fallacy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage." In this way, the deeper the criticism, the higher the awareness of the two-line struggle among the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and the deeper the roots of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their minds.

For every task of struggle, criticism, and transformation, they mobilized the masses extensively and deeply, fighting a "people's war" of revolutionary criticism. Streamlining the organization seemed to be just a cadre issue, but in essence, it was an issue of breaking away from the revisionist management system. Without fully mobilizing the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism, this task could not be completed. In November last year, when streamlining the organization, the factory revolutionary committee mobilized all cadres and workers in the factory to use Mao Zedong Thought to expose and criticize the revisionist management system and to expose the serious harm of bloated organizations and excessive personnel. Political awareness was raised, and thoughts were communicated, leading to a comprehensive understanding. Cadres volunteered to go down, and the factory's more than ten departments were streamlined into three offices. Half of the cadres were sent to the production front line, and the style of the organization and the spiritual face of the cadres were completely renewed. Everyone said that this method of doing things was thorough in breaking and solid in establishing. Everyone grasped Mao Zedong Thought, and if anyone tried to promote revisionism again, the masses would not agree.

For a year, revolutionary criticism in this factory has never stopped, with everyone criticizing with their mouths and pens, and the fire of revolutionary criticism burning more fiercely. Revolutionary criticism has become a powerful driving force for implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The broad revolutionary workers' love for the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian feelings have never been as deep as today, and the enthusiasm for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has never been as high as today. They are in the workshop with their hearts in the country and their eyes on the world, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, printing the red book for the world's revolutionary people quickly, well, and economically. Everyone said: Printing one more copy of Chairman Mao's works is contributing one more bit of strength to the world revolution. We must turn the Foreign Language Printing Factory into a red stronghold for spreading Mao Zedong Thought to the world, so that people all over the world can read the revolutionary book, and let the invincible Mao Zedong Thought spread all over the world!

    紧跟毛主席战略部署掌握斗争大方向
    狠抓阶级斗争深入开展革命的大批判
    解放军炮兵学习毛主席著作先进集体、炮兵机关驻北京外文印刷厂支左小组的支左经验
    人民解放军炮兵机关驻北京外文印刷厂支左小组和厂里的革命职工、革命干部一道，以无限忠于伟大导师毛主席的无产阶级的深厚感情，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，迅速实现了以班组为基础的革命大联合，去年九月成立了革命委员会，逐步团结了百分之九十五以上的群众和干部，完成了机构改革，目前正在以整党为中心深入开展斗、批、改。这个厂的面貌发生了天翻地覆的变化，到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象。生产稳步上升，出现了历史上从未有过的新水平，去年提前完成了国家生产计划，以几十种外国文字印制了近一千万册毛主席著作，超过了建厂十六年来印制毛主席著作外文本的总和，向全世界一百四十多个国家和地区的革命人民输送了威力无比的精神原子弹。这个支左小组的经验最重要的一条，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，持续深入地开展革命大批判，推动毛主席一系列最新指示全面落实。
    革命大批判推动革命大联合和革命三结合
    去年三月，这个支左小组进厂的时候，正是这个厂两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的紧要关头。那时候，斗争错综复杂，两派严重对立。怎样使革命群众联合起来呢？
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。”支左人员遵照毛主席的教导，通过调查研究，认真分析了当时的斗争形势，认为两派群众所以严重对立，是中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行资产阶级反动路线造成的恶果。广大革命群众、革命干部同中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的矛盾，是主要矛盾。这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的集中表现，是敌我矛盾。当前出现这种局面，就是因为放松了对敌斗争。只有紧紧抓住这个主要矛盾，开展革命大批判，充分揭露中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的滔天罪行，戳穿他们挑动群众斗群众的阴谋，才能使两派群众联合起来，共同对敌。于是，他们组织两派群众学习毛主席关于“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题”的教导，引导大家把斗争矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人。揭发的大量事实表明，党内最大的一小撮走资派和北京旧市委反革命修正主义集团的黑手，伸进了外文印刷厂。他们疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，竭力推行反革命修正主义路线。中国赫鲁晓夫还让他的老婆王××控制这个厂的大权，千方百计地限制印制外文版毛主席著作，而大量印制黑《修养》，使这个厂成为对国外散布反革命修正主义毒素的阵地。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们为了保自己，蒙蔽群众，挑动群众斗群众。通过革命大批判，使大家提高了觉悟，擦亮了眼睛。革命造反派说：“我们同受蒙蔽的群众是一根藤上的瓜，都是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，党内一小撮走资派是我们的共同敌人，我们要集中火力斗倒斗臭党内一小撮走资派。”受蒙蔽的群众说：“过去，我们没有用阶级观点看问题，上了党内一小撮走资派的当。我们一定要和革命造反派一道，同党内一小撮走资派作坚决的斗争。”这样，全厂革命职工很快就联合起来，落实了毛主席关于按系统实行革命大联合的最新指示。
    实现革命大联合以后，支左人员就协助搞好解放干部的工作。这时候又碰到新的问题。大家对干部的看法极不一致。支左小组对这个厂的干部进行了全面分析以后，认为大多数干部是好的和比较好的。群众在干部问题上的分歧，主要是资产阶级反动路线“打击一大片，保护一小撮”造成的恶果。要很好地落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，必须开展革命大批判，使大家分清什么是毛主席的干部政策和干部路线，什么是修正主义的干部政策和干部路线。他们首先组织大家学习了毛主席有关干部问题的教导，接着就发动大家展开对修正主义干部路线的大批判。他们组织中层以上干部开了十多次小型批判会和全厂批判大会，许多干部都积极地投入了斗争，从而使干部在大批判中“亮相”，在大批判中自己教育自己。革命群众也在大批判中掌握了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，鉴别了干部，帮助革命领导干部站了出来。例如，对原党委副书记，有的要打倒他，有的要保他。在大批判中，他坚定地站在革命派一边，向厂里党内走资派展开了面对面的斗争，揭穿了厂里党内走资派执行中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的内幕，同时主动检查了自己的错误，取得了群众的谅解，大家一致公认他是革命领导干部，并选他为厂革委会副主任。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”这个支左小组经过反复实践体会到，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是在同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的斗争中发展起来的。要贯彻毛主席的革命路线，落实毛主席的最新指示，必须以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，持续深入地开展革命大批判，在各个领域中狠批资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的流毒。
    革命大批判促进革命委员会坚定地走突出政治的道路
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。”怎样落实毛主席的这一最新指示呢？厂革命委员会一成立，支左小组就同厂革委会成员一起学习，明确认识到这个临时权力机构，必须是无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，坚定地走突出无产阶级政治道路的领导班子，并且作出关于狠抓活学活用毛主席著作和念念不忘阶级斗争的决议。
    但是，在实际工作中，有的同志有时却脱离了突出政治的轨道，不自觉地突出了业务。支左小组和厂革委会认为，这主要是由于中国赫鲁晓夫长期推行的修正主义经营管理制度的流毒还没有肃清，于是发动全厂狠批修正主义经营管理制度。广大革命群众和革命干部运用大字报、小字报、黑板报、广播，通过大会、小会，充分揭露修正主义经营管理制度的罪状和危害，用毛泽东思想逐条进行批判。大家在批判中越来越清楚地看到，中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义经营管理制度，千毒万毒，最毒的是反对学习毛主席著作，反对突出无产阶级政治，大搞物质刺激、奖金挂帅，来腐蚀工人灵魂。工人们说：“这是中国赫鲁晓夫向我们发射的糖衣炮弹，是用软刀子杀人，是为他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的服务的。”通过革命的大批判，大家进一步认识到：新生的革命委员会必须永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，走突出无产阶级政治的道路，才能带领广大革命群众把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证国家永不变色。
    认识提高以后，厂革委会更加自觉地把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，大办毛泽东思想学习班，先后开办了六十多期，九百多人参加了学习；建立了早请示、晚汇报和天天读、学习日的制度。厂里到处是活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，斗私批修的战场。人人学习毛主席著作，个个关心阶级斗争。厂革委会带领全厂革命职工顶住了来自右的方面和极“左”的方面的干扰，把斗争矛头始终指向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，彻底扫除一切“变色龙”、“小爬虫”。有一个车间，阶级敌人利用资产阶级、小资产阶级派性挑起群众之间的斗争。过去，有的同志把这看成是派性斗争。支左小组和厂革委会的同志一起学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述，用阶级分析的方法，分析了这个车间的斗争现实，认为这个车间的派性斗争是阶级敌人打着“革命”的招牌，喊着“革命”的口号，利用一些派性重的同志搞起来的。厂革委会带领群众把“变色龙”揪出来以后，这个车间的形势大变，广大群众团结起来，革命和生产出现崭新的局面。
    革命大批判有力地推动了本单位斗、批、改
    支左小组帮助厂革委会狠抓革命大批判，推动毛主席最新指示的落实，思想越来越明确，路子越走越宽阔。他们通过搞好革命大批判，进一步推动了本单位的斗、批、改。
    他们把革命大批判同形势、任务和思想实际紧密结合起来。在批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线时，首先狠批了厂里党内走资派贯彻这条修正主义路线的罪行。各车间、班组还结合思想实际组织小会进行批判。有的班组中奴隶主义的毒害较深，就反复批奴隶主义。有的班组中“吃小亏占大便宜”的毒素较深，就反复批“吃小亏占大便宜”的谬论。这样，越批越深入，广大革命群众和革命干部两条路线斗争的觉悟越高，毛主席的最新指示在思想上扎下的根子越深。
    每一项斗、批、改任务，他们都广泛深入地发动群众，打革命大批判的“人民战争”。精简机构，看来只是一个干部问题，实质上是破除修正主义的管理体制的问题，不充分发动群众开展革命大批判，就不能完成这个任务。去年十一月精简机构时，厂革委会发动全厂干部、职工用毛泽东思想大揭大批修正主义的经营管理制度，大揭机构臃肿、人浮于事的严重危害。政治觉悟提高了，思想通了，一通百通，干部纷纷要求下去，全厂十多个科室精简为三个办公室，半数干部下放到了生产第一线，机关的作风和干部的精神面貌焕然一新。大家说，这种搞法，破得彻底，立得牢固。大家掌握了毛泽东思想，谁想再搞修正主义那一套，群众就不会答应了。
    一年来，这个厂革命大批判一直没有间断过，人人口诛笔伐，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。革命大批判成了落实毛主席最新指示的强大动力。广大革命职工热爱伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级感情从来没有象今天这样深，活学活用毛泽东思想的积极性从来没有象今天这样高。他们身在车间，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，以最大的革命干劲，为世界革命人民多快好省地印制红色宝书。大家说：多印制一本毛主席著作，就是对世界革命多贡献一分力量。我们一定要把外文印刷厂办成向世界人民传播毛泽东思想的红色阵地，让全世界人民都能读到革命宝书，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想传遍全世界！
