The members of the Yanggao County Revolutionary Committee in Shanxi Province, following the instructions of Chairman Mao on trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit, went deep into the countryside. They discussed extensively with the masses and held democratic discussions to organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. This liberated over ninety-five percent of the county and commune leaders, effectively promoting and consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Taiyuan on the 16th, the Yanggao County Revolutionary Committee in Shanxi Province adheres to the mass line, respects the masses' pioneering spirit, and mobilizes the masses to organize large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions swiftly and effectively.

By February, Yanggao County had organized nearly two thousand study classes of various types. These study classes took "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as their fundamental guideline and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their primary task. They vigorously promoted Chairman Mao's revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, effectively promoting and consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" throughout the county. Currently, over ninety-five percent of the leaders at the county and commune levels have been liberated, with over eighty percent of the cadres participating in the temporary power organs of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" at various levels.

As early as May last year, the Yanggao County Revolutionary Committee relied on the masses' pioneering spirit to establish a cadre training class in the county, organizing rural cadres to study Chairman Mao's works. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism," the vast number of rural cadres and commune members in Yanggao County were overjoyed and took action, showing high enthusiasm for organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They flocked to the county seat, seeking experiences and methods from the county revolutionary committee. Faced with such fervent revolutionary enthusiasm from the masses, some leaders developed a "three-heads" mentality: fearing lack of experience and disrupting order, waiting for higher authorities to provide experiences and methods before taking action, and advocating a slow and steady approach.

To address these issues, the county revolutionary committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, convened a meeting of the leading cadres of various departments at the county level. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and Chairman Mao's quotations on the mass line. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "send cadres to the lower levels to walk around, observe, adhere to the mass line, and consult with the masses on matters, becoming the masses' students." They conducted investigations and research in the countryside. Upon arriving in the countryside, many leading cadres were surprised. They saw that the countryside was filled with battlefields for criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism. Everyone discussed their experiences in eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, expressing their determination to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Mao Zedong Thought had never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it was today. Their emotions were deeply stirred, and they felt that they were like women with bound feet, far behind the rapidly advancing new situation and the masses' awareness. The broad masses' revolutionary enthusiasm educated the cadres, and the cadres consciously criticized the "three-heads" mentality. Everyone realized that "the masses are the real heroes," and as long as they trusted the masses and relied on them, everyone could work together to organize and successfully run Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

After the leading members unified their thoughts, they followed Chairman Mao's instructions on trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit. They mobilized the masses to organize large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They discussed extensively with the masses and held democratic discussions to determine the methods of organizing study classes, primarily focusing on decentralized, small-scale, and part-time classes, combining a small number of centralized classes with a large number of decentralized classes. They relied on the masses to run the classes, quickly forming a wave of organizing large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In cities and countryside, revolutionary committees, government agencies, factories, schools, and residents' committees all organized classes; communes, production brigades, production teams, and even individual households also organized classes. There were large-scale and small-scale classes, full-time and half-time classes, and more importantly, mass part-time study classes organized by systems, industries, and production units. Workers in factories turned their workshops into study classes; farmers in fields turned their fields into study classes. The plans and methods for the study classes were discussed and formulated by the masses; the participants were discussed and proposed by the masses; the leading bodies of the study classes were elected by the masses; the class study meetings were managed by the masses themselves; and the focus of different study classes was discussed and decided by the masses. Because the leaders and the masses worked together, in a short period, Mao Zedong Thought study classes were widely promoted throughout the county, forming a lively and enthusiastic atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions.

Chairman Mao taught us: "We should go among the masses, learn from the masses, and summarize their experiences into better, more systematic theories and methods, then tell the masses (propagate) and call on the masses to implement them, solve the masses' problems, and liberate and bring happiness to the masses." After the study classes were widely organized, the leaders at various levels in Yanggao County followed Chairman Mao's instructions, going among the masses with the spirit of being willing students, seriously learning from the masses, discovering the masses' new creations, and summarizing the masses' new experiences. For example, the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Luowenzhao Commune, Xiaoshenyu Brigade, and Xujia Garden Brigade each had their own characteristics and were recognized by the masses. The leading bodies at various levels grasped these typical examples, held on-site meetings to exchange experiences, and achieved good results. Since organizing the study classes, they have summarized and promoted seven typical experiences and organized advanced elements in criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism to give lectures, sharing their experiences in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions to revolutionize their souls. This has greatly improved the quality of the study classes.

Chairman Mao taught us to let the masses themselves rise up in revolution, educate themselves, manage themselves, and liberate themselves. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Yanggao County have always adhered to this principle, arousing the self-awareness and active participation of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism and self-revolution.

The revolutionary masses and cadres participating in the study classes, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army, used Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles" as weapons. They consciously linked their thoughts with reality, linked the two-line struggle with reality, and linked their recognition and stance at critical moments with reality. They used Mao Zedong Thought as an arrow to hit the target of their actual thoughts, consciously finding problems in the two-line struggle, finding causes in their worldview, finding lessons in their mistakes, and finding answers in Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, many study classes grasped the problems accurately and dug deep into the roots.

Because the study classes adhered to the principle of the masses educating themselves and liberating themselves, they greatly aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of a large number of cadres and commune members to criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism. Everyone consciously rebelled against the "self" in their minds and seized the power of the "self" in their minds, raising the revolutionization of their thoughts to a new level.

　　领导和群众一齐动手大办学习班
    山西阳高县革命委员会领导成员，遵照毛主席关于信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众首创精神的教导，深入农村，同群众广泛商量，民主讨论，举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，解放了百分之九十五以上的县社领导干部，有力地促进和巩固了革命大联合和革命“三结合”。
    据新华社太原十六日电　山西省阳高县革命委员会坚持群众路线，尊重群众的首创精神，放手发动群众大办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示又快又好。
    到二月份为止，阳高县已举办了各种类型的学习班近两千个。这些学习班，把“斗私，批修”作为办学的根本纲领，把落实毛主席最新指示作为办学的根本任务，大力发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，有力地促进和巩固了全县的革命大联合和革命“三结合”。现在，县和公社已有百分之九十五以上的领导干部得到解放，其中有百分之八十以上的干部参加了各级革命“三结合”的临时权力机构。
    早在去年五月份，阳高县革命委员会就依靠群众的首创精神，在县上办起了干部训练班，组织农村干部学习毛主席著作。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以后，阳高县广大农村干部和社员欢欣鼓舞，闻风而动，大办毛泽东思想学习班的热情很高。他们纷纷来到县城，向县革委会要经验，要办法。面对着群众这种旺盛的革命热情，有些领导同志却产生了“三头”思想：“怕”字当头，耽心没有经验，搞乱了秩序；“等”字当头，等上级有了经验、办法再大办；“稳”字当头，主张慢慢来，逐步办。
    针对这些思想，县革命委员会在人民解放军帮助下，召开了县级各部门领导班子会议，认真学习了毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》和毛主席关于群众路线的语录，并遵循毛主席的“干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，深入农村进行调查研究。一到农村，许多领导干部吃了一惊。他们看到农村四处摆开了斗私批修的战场。大家谈的是破私立公的体会，表的是落实毛主席最新指示的决心，毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样深入人心。他们的心情十分激动，深深感到自己象小脚女人一样，大大落后于突飞猛进的新形势，落后于群众的觉悟。广大群众的革命积极性教育了干部，干部们自觉地批判了“三头”思想，大家从思想上认识到“群众是真正的英雄”，只要相信群众，依靠群众，大家动手，一定能够大办和办好毛泽东思想学习班。
    领导成员的思想统一以后，大家遵循毛主席关于信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神的教导，放手发动群众大办毛泽东思想学习班。他们同群众广泛商量，由群众民主讨论，确定以分散为主、小型为主、业余为主，少量集中办和大量分散办相结合的方法，依靠群众办学，很快形成了大办毛泽东思想学习班的热潮。在城乡上下，革命委员会办，机关办，工厂办，学校办，居民委员会也办；公社办，生产大队办，生产队办，社员家庭也办。学习班有大型的、小型的，有全日制、半日制，更多的是按系统、按行业、按生产单位举办的群众性的业余学习班。工人在车间，车间就是学习班；农民到田间，田间就是学习班。学习班的方案、办法，由群众讨论制定，入学人员，由群众讨论提出；学习班领导班子，由群众选举产生；班组学习会，由群众自己掌握；不同的学习班重点解决什么问题，由群众讨论决定。由于领导和群众齐心协力，一齐动手，在短短的时间内，毛泽东思想学习班就在全县范围内大普及，形成了积极、热烈地学习毛主席著作和毛主席最新指示的大好局面。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习，把他们的经验综合起来，成为更好的有条理的道理和办法，然后再告诉群众（宣传），并号召群众实行起来，解决群众的问题，使群众得到解放和幸福。”在学习班普遍办起来以后，阳高县各级领导人员遵照毛主席的这个教导，深入到群众中去，以甘当小学生的精神，认真向群众学习，发现群众的新创造，总结群众的新经验。如罗文皂公社、下神峪大队、许家园大队等单位的毛泽东思想学习班，各有各的特点，都为群众所公认。各级领导班子抓住这些典型，召开现场会交流经验，收到了良好的效果。从办学习班以来，他们先后总结推广了七个典型经验，还组织斗私批修的先进分子巡回讲用，介绍他们活学活用毛主席最新指示，在灵魂深处闹革命的体会，对提高学习班的质量起了很好作用。
    毛主席教导我们，让群众自己起来革命，自己教育自己，自己管理自己，自己解放自己。阳高县的毛泽东思想学习班始终坚持了这一原则，从各个方面唤起革命干部和革命群众的斗私批修的自觉性、自我革命的积极性。
    参加学习班的革命群众和革命干部，在解放军的辅导下，以毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”为武器，自觉地联系思想实际，联系两条路线斗争的实际，联系自己在关键时刻的认识和立场，用毛泽东思想之“矢”去射自己思想实际之“的”，自觉地在两条路线斗争中找问题，在世界观上找原因，在错误中找教训，在毛主席著作中找答案。因而，不少学习班问题抓得准，根子挖得深。
    由于学习班坚持了群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的原则，极大地激发了广大干部、社员的斗私批修的革命热情。大家自觉地造头脑里“私”字的反，夺头脑里“私”字的权，把思想革命化提高到了一个新的水准。
