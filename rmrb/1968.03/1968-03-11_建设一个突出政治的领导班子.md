Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive is the great guideline for implementing military and political training, and it is the beacon for achieving a comprehensive victory in the proletarian educational revolution. In the March 7th Directive, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "The military should, in stages and batches, conduct military training for colleges, middle schools, and upper grades of primary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, reorganizing organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership organs, and implementing struggle, criticism, and reform." Through a year of practice, we deeply feel that in military training, building a three-in-one leadership team that emphasizes proletarian politics is a key issue in fully implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive.

In March of last year, we responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call for "three supports and two militaries" and came to Beijing Yuegezhuang Middle School to carry out military training tasks. We raised high the great red banner of Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive, guiding revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. By mid-April, we achieved revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes. In early May, we established the Revolutionary Committee of the school, and immediately began the process of resuming classes and making revolution.

Chairman Mao said: "In a school of a hundred people, if there is no leadership core formed in practice (not artificially assembled) of the most active, most upright, and most agile few or even a dozen people from among the teachers, staff, and students, then this school is definitely not going to be well run." Vice Chairman Lin said: The leadership team is very important; the leadership team is the government. Following the teachings of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and in light of the actual situation at Yuegezhuang Middle School, we realized that consolidating and improving the revolutionary three-in-one leadership team is a top priority in seizing and holding proletarian power; and to make this newly established leadership team play the role of a "locomotive" in resuming classes and making revolution, and become a strong fighting fortress in creating a new type of proletarian school, the key lies in helping it do a good job of thought revolutionization, insisting on emphasizing proletarian politics, and using Mao Zedong Thought to seize power and use power correctly.

Helping the leadership team members raise their awareness of seizing power for the revolution. Not long after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, a "demolition wind" blew up among some teachers and students, saying that the Revolutionary Committee was a "three-in-one" and a "hodgepodge" and should be "smashed." At this critical juncture, some people in the Revolutionary Committee were afraid of taking risks and did not want to continue. We realized that to withstand this "demolition wind," we must use Mao Zedong Thought to unify the leadership team's thinking and enhance their awareness of seizing power for the revolution. "If this 'group of people' does not act in unison, then don't even think about leading tens of thousands of people to fight or build." We promptly organized the members of the Revolutionary Committee to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, proletarian dictatorship, and serving the people, guiding everyone to analyze and understand problems from the perspective of class struggle, and at the same time, to examine their own thoughts. Through the study, everyone realized that seizing power and consolidating power is the focus of class struggle; school leadership is the lifeline of the school; only by being dedicated to the revolution can one seize power and use power correctly. Some comrades voluntarily examined and criticized their thoughts of not wanting to do it because of selfish motives. Those who originally thought that being a committee member was nothing important decided to seize power and use power correctly for the revolution. Everyone was filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, saying: "We will stand firm for the people's interests, correct our mistakes, and even if the sky falls, we will dare to withstand it, and we will not be afraid of a typhoon of level twelve."

At this time, we also took the opportunity to organize all the committee members to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line and the mass viewpoint, as well as "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." This made everyone more clearly recognize that the masses are the real heroes and are the most reasonable. The committee members all appeared before the revolutionary teachers and students with the attitude of "ordinary soldiers," humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, and at the same time, explaining to the masses that the Revolutionary Committee is a revolutionary three-in-one, and the general direction is correct. The Revolutionary Committee of the school also took the initiative to propose an open rectification, asking everyone to offer suggestions and collectively improve the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, thus gaining the support of the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

The anarchist tendencies among some teachers and students were the ideological basis of the "demolition wind." We also worked closely with the Revolutionary Committee of the school to organize the broad revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's works, focusing on discussing how to maintain proletarian dictatorship and proletarian authority. Through study and discussion, everyone realized that the Revolutionary Committee is a new thing and should be nurtured; it can only be supported, not demolished. The committee members of the Revolutionary Committee deeply felt: "Of all the rules, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate people is the first rule; of all the difficulties, following Chairman Mao's instructions makes things easy."

Lead by example and grasp the fundamentals. The Revolutionary Committee had just been established, and all kinds of work rushed in at once. With so many things to do, from where should we start? The committee members felt unsure for a moment. We guided them to focus their main efforts on studying Chairman Mao's works and grasping people's active thoughts, and to do a good job of emphasizing politics. Every time the Revolutionary Committee or the Standing Committee met, we always guided everyone to first analyze the situation and the school's ideological trends. Based on a clear direction and a clear understanding of the situation, we then began to study the specific work deployment issues, making everyone clearly realize from their actual experience that the Revolutionary Committee should mainly conduct political leadership, insisting on Mao Zedong Thought in everything, and firmly grasping the direction of the revolutionary struggle. We also took the lead in exposing our thoughts when studying major issues, leading everyone to put their thoughts on the table, and using Mao Zedong Thought to unify their understanding, turning each meeting into a living classroom that emphasizes politics and insists on the four firsts. During a discussion on organizing a major battle of criticizing and reforming the self across the school, everyone put forward various active thoughts: some were afraid of causing people to fight each other, and of being criticized themselves; some were afraid of exposing their selfish motives, and of being criticized by the masses; some were afraid that the masses would know about the dirty things in their thoughts, and would have no face to continue working. In response to this situation, we organized everyone to study and discuss, making everyone realize that insisting on the four firsts requires efforts in grasping active thoughts; to grasp the active thoughts of the masses, one must first grasp one's own active thoughts. Only in this way can leaders and masses exchange hearts, closely unite the upper and lower levels, and jointly do a good job of thought revolutionization.

Over the past year, by firmly grasping the study of Chairman Mao's works and the thought revolutionization of the leadership team, the authority of the Revolutionary Committee of the school has been increasingly enhanced, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has been deeply carried out, the spiritual face of the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff has been completely renewed, and the resumption of classes and making revolution and the struggle, criticism, and reform have been carried out vigorously and solidly. The whole school, on the basis of continuously and deeply carrying out the great criticism, has thoroughly criticized the revisionist educational line and established the proletarian educational line, achieving great success in the educational revolution.

The revolutionary teachers and students of the whole school are full of fighting spirit and are vigorously carrying out the educational revolution.

　　建设一个突出政治的领导班子
　　北京岳各庄中学军训团
    毛主席的“三·七”指示，是实行军政训练的伟大纲领，是夺取无产阶级教育革命全面胜利的指路明灯。毛主席在“三·七”指示中明确指出：“军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。”通过一年来的实践，我们深深地体会到：在军训中，建设一个突出无产阶级政治的三结合领导班子，是全面落实毛主席“三·七”指示的一个关键问题。
    去年三月，我们响应伟大领袖毛主席“三支”“两军”的战斗号召，来到北京市岳各庄中学执行军训任务。我们高举毛主席“三·七”指示的伟大红旗，引导革命师生员工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，于四月中旬实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合，五月初成立了校革命委员会，紧接着就开始复课闹革命。
    毛主席说：“一个百人的学校，如果没有一个从教员中、职员中、学生中按照实际形成的（不是勉强凑集的）最积极最正派最机敏的几个人乃至十几个人的领导骨干，这个学校就一定办不好。”林副主席说：领导班子很重要，领导班子就是政权。遵照毛主席和林副主席的教导，结合岳各庄中学的实际情况，我们认识到：巩固和提高革命三结合的领导班子，是关系到掌好无产阶级政权的头等大事；而要使这个新建立的领导班子在复课闹革命中起到“火车头”的作用，在开创无产阶级新型学校中成为坚强的战斗堡垒，关键又在于帮助它搞好思想革命化，坚持突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想掌好权，用好权。
    帮助领导班子成员提高为革命掌好权的自觉性。校革命委员会建立不久，在部分师生中就刮起了一股拆台风。说革委会是什么“三凑合”、“大杂烩”，“应该砸烂”。在这个关口上，革委会中有的人怕担风险，不想干了。我们认识到，要顶住这股“拆台风”，必须用毛泽东思想统一领导班子的思想，增强他们为革命掌权的自觉性。“如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”我们及时组织革命委员会的成员学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争、无产阶级专政和为人民服务的教导，引导大家用阶级斗争观点分析、认识问题，同时对照检查自己的思想。通过学习，大家认识到，夺取政权和巩固政权，是阶级斗争的焦点；学校领导权，是学校的命根子；只有一心为革命，才能掌好权用好权。有的同志自觉地检查批判了自己因私心杂念而不愿干的思想。原来认为当个委员无所谓的同志，下决心为革命掌好权，用好权。大家满怀革命的豪情说：“我们为人民的利益坚持好的，改正错的，就是天塌下来也敢顶住，十二级台风刮来也不怕。”
    这时，我们又因势利导，组织全体委员学习毛主席关于群众观点和群众路线以及“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导，使大家更加明确地认识到群众是真正的英雄，是最通情达理的。委员们纷纷以“普通一兵”的姿态，出现在革命师生面前，虚心听取群众意见，同时，向群众说明校革委会是革命的三结合，大方向是正确的。校革命委员会还主动提出开门整风，要求大家提意见，群策群力改进革委会的领导，从而得到了广大革命师生的支持。
    部分师生中存在的无政府主义倾向，是拆台风的思想基础。我们又大力协同校革命委员会，组织广大革命师生学习毛主席著作，着重讨论如何维护无产阶级专政和无产阶级权威。通过学习讨论，大家认识到，革命委员会是新生事物，应该尽力扶植它，只能补台，不能拆台，革委会委员深有体会地说：“千条万条，用毛泽东思想教育人是第一条；千难万难，照毛主席的指示办事就不难。”
    言传身带抓根本。革委会刚刚成立，各项工作一齐涌到面前。千头万绪，从何处抓起？委员们一时感到心里没底。我们就引导他们要以主要精力大抓毛主席著作学习，大抓人的活思想，把好突出政治的关。每次召开革委会或常委会时，我们总是引导大家首先分析形势，分析学校的思想动向，在明确方向和弄清情况的基础上，再开始研究具体的工作部署问题，使大家从实际体验中明确地认识到，革命委员会应当主要进行政治领导，事事坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向。我们还在研究重大问题时带头亮思想，带动大家把思想摆出来，用毛泽东思想来统一认识，把每次会议变成突出政治、坚持四个第一的活课堂。在一次研究组织全校斗私批修的大战役时，大家就摆出了各式各样的活思想：有的怕引起群众斗群众，自己挨整；有的怕把私心亮出来，群众抓辫子；有的怕群众知道了自己思想上的脏东西，没有脸面再做工作。针对这种情况，我们组织大家进行了学习和讨论，使大家认识到，坚持四个第一，就要在抓活思想这个突破口上下功夫；要抓好群众的活思想，必须首先抓好自己的活思想。只有这样领导和群众互相交心，才能密切上下关系，共同搞好思想革命化。
    一年来，由于狠抓了毛主席著作的学习和领导班子的思想革命化，校革命委员会的权威日益提高，全校活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动深入开展，广大革命师生员工的精神面貌焕然一新，复课闹革命和斗、批、改搞得轰轰烈烈而又扎扎实实。全校在持续深入开展革命大批判的基础上，大破了修正主义教育路线，大立了无产阶级教育路线，教育革命取得了很大的成绩。
    全校革命师生斗志昂扬，意气风发，正在深入地开展教育革命。
