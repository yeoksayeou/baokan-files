The U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, launched a large-scale surprise attack on Jordan in the early hours of the 21st, committing a new act of aggression. This is the largest act of aggression by Israel against Jordan since February 15.

According to a broadcast by the Amman radio station in the Jordanian capital, the Israeli aggressors crossed the Jordan River in the early hours of the 21st and launched a new aggression against Jordan. They encountered fierce resistance from the Jordanian army. By 9:30 AM, three Israeli fighter jets had been shot down, 25 tanks and tracked vehicles had been destroyed, and approximately 200 enemy personnel had been killed or wounded. The broadcast said that the fighting was still ongoing and that Jordan had taken control of the situation.

With the support of U.S. imperialism, Israel has recently intensified military provocations against Arab countries, attempting to force Arab countries to submit to so-called "political solutions" and to stop armed struggles and patriotic activities on Arab lands occupied by Israel. Recently, Israel has repeatedly pressured and threatened Jordan to "stop" the so-called "destructive activities" of the Arab people in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River.

According to a statement issued by Amman: At 3:30 AM on the 21st, Israeli forces attacked Jordanian positions south of the Jordan River. Israeli troops crossed the Jordan River near the Damiya Bridge and King Hussein Bridge, parachuted commandos into the Karama refugee camp, where there are approximately 30,000 Arab refugees, and then launched air strikes on Jordanian positions.

The statement said: After fierce fighting, the Israeli forces have been repelled. The commandos parachuted by Israel in the Karama area have been surrounded by Jordanian forces. Jordanian troops are fighting Israeli aggressors along the entire southern front of the Jordan River.

According to reports, the Jordanian capital, Amman, is on high alert to prepare for any emergency.

According to Western news agencies, Israel had long been amassing large forces on the border in preparation for a new attack on Jordan. This act of aggression is being led by Israeli Defense Minister Dayan, with Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol personally going to the front lines to "inspect."

    约旦军队正在约旦河南部战线同以色列侵略军激烈战斗
    新华社大马士革二十一日电　美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列，二十一日清晨向约旦发动大规模的突然袭击，犯下了新的侵略罪行。这是二月十五日以来以色列对约旦发动的最大一次侵略行动。
    据约旦首都安曼电台广播，以色列侵略军二十一日清晨越过约旦河，向约旦发动了新的侵略后，遇到了约旦军队的激烈抵抗，截至上午九点三十分，以色列三架战斗机被击落，二十五辆坦克和履带车辆被击毁，大约二百名敌人被打死打伤。广播说，战斗正在进行中。约旦已经控制了局势。
    以色列侵略军在美帝国主义支持下，最近加紧对阿拉伯国家进行军事挑衅，妄图迫使阿拉伯国家屈服于所谓“政治解决”和制止在被以色列占领的阿拉伯土地上的武装斗争与爱国活动。最近以色列一再向约旦施加压力和进行恫吓，要约旦“制止”阿拉伯人民在被占领的约旦河西岸的所谓“破坏活动”。
    根据安曼发表的公报说：二十一日早晨三点三十分，以色列军队袭击了约旦河以南地区的约旦阵地。以色列的部队在达米亚桥和侯赛因国王桥附近越过约旦河，用直升飞机在约有三万名阿拉伯难民的卡拉马难民营地区空投伞兵，然后出动空军轰炸约旦的阵地。
    公报说：经过激烈战斗，以色列军队已受挫。以色列在卡拉马地区空投的伞兵，被约旦军队包围。约旦部队正在约旦河南部战线全线同以色列侵略者作战。
    据报道，约旦首都安曼处于戒备状态，以准备应付一切紧急情况。
    据西方通讯社报道，以色列早就在边境集结大量兵力准备对约旦发动新的进攻。这次侵略行动由以色列国防部长达扬指挥，以色列总理艾希科尔也亲自到现场去“视察”。
