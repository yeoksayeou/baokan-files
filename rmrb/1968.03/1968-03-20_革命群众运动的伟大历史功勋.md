	Correctly handling the relationship with the masses and mass movements is a fundamental issue of the proletarian worldview, a fundamental issue of Mao Zedong Thought. Every revolutionary cadre, regardless of their position, must consciously undergo the rigorous test of the mass movement in this extremely profound Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Class struggle in society and the struggle between the two lines within the Party cannot but profoundly reflect in our cadre ranks. The vast majority of our cadres are good or relatively good, firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, some cadres, due to long-term poisoning by the bourgeois reactionary line concocted by the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, think they are building socialism, but in reality, they are building capitalism. The great historical merit of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great historical merit of the mass criticism movement, lies in helping these cadres distinguish between Chairman Mao's socialist road and the fake socialist, real capitalist road of a Chinese Khrushchev; between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line of a Chinese Khrushchev.

	If our cadres fall seriously ill politically, what should be done? This requires using the momentum of the mass movement to "give the patient a heavy shock, shout at them, 'You're sick!', making the patient jump in surprise, sweat profusely, and then properly treat them." In this great revolution, it is precisely the mighty force of this strong east wind that has cured and is curing some cadres of their political and ideological ailments.

	Our Communist Party cadres must correctly handle criticism from the masses. They have only the obligation to listen to the masses' criticism and absolutely no right to reject it.

	Cadres have two attitudes towards mistakes: one is to correct them, that is, to seriously conduct self-criticism, seriously listen to the masses' criticism, and thus gain the masses' understanding and trust. The vast majority of our cadres do this. The other is not to correct them, that is, to vent their resentment and dissatisfaction with the mass criticism, to raise their tails at any opportunity, and even slide to the point of completely negating the mass movement. Such people, having made mistakes and not correcting them, will inevitably lose their revolutionary nature and go astray.

	This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a profound socialist revolution that touches people's souls, a new stage in the development of the socialist revolution. Named the Cultural Revolution, it is actually a great political and ideological revolution. Now it is clear that many cadres were not prepared ideologically for this great revolution. Old thoughts, when encountering a suitable climate, inevitably pop up from their minds. Thus, it is inevitable that they make mistakes, and their thoughts inevitably fluctuate, even multiple times. Fluctuations are not a big deal. They will temper and elevate our cadres, gain experience and lessons, and better transform their worldview. At the same time, it will also make the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses understand that the revolutionary road is tortuous and not smooth.

	All cadres must jump out of the small circle of "self," think about the seven hundred million people and the several billion people, think about the big issue of preventing capitalist restoration, think about the sublime ideal of liberating all mankind, forever maintain revolutionary vigor, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, be the masses' little students, and follow the great leader of the proletarian revolution, Chairman Mao, to the end.

　　革命群众运动的伟大历史功勋
　　本报评论员
    正确地对待群众和群众运动，是无产阶级世界观的根本问题，是毛泽东思想的根本问题。每一个革命干部，不论职位高低，都要在这场极其深刻的无产阶级文化大革命中，自觉地接受群众运动的严峻考验。
      社会上的阶级斗争，党内两条路线的斗争，不能不深刻地反映到我们的干部队伍中来。我们绝大多数干部是好的和比较好的，是坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边的。但是，有的干部，由于长期受党内最大一小撮走资派炮制的资产阶级反动路线的毒害，以为自己在搞社会主义，实际上搞的却是资本主义。这场无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史功勋，群众性批判运动的伟大历史功勋，就在于帮助这些干部分清什么是毛主席开辟的社会主义道路，什么是中国赫鲁晓夫骗人的假社会主义、真资本主义道路；分清什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线。
      我们的干部，如果得了政治上的严重病症，怎么办？这就要借群众运动的东风，“重重地给患病者一个刺激，向他们大喝一声，说：‘你有病呀！’使患者为之一惊，出一身汗，然后好好地叫他们治疗。”在这场大革命中，正是这股强劲东风的无比威力，医治好了和医治着一些干部政治上和思想上的毛病。
    我们共产党的干部，应该正确地对待群众的批评。他们只有听取群众批评的义务，绝没有拒绝群众批评的权利。
    干部对待错误，有两种态度：一种是改，就是认真地进行自我批评，认真地听取群众的批评，从而取得群众的谅解和信任。我们绝大多数干部是这样做的。一种是不改，就是发泄对群众性批判的怨气和不满，一有机会尾巴就翘起来，甚至滑到全盘否定群众运动的地步。这种人犯了错误，又知过不改，就必然会丧失革命性，走到邪路上去。
    这次无产阶级文化大革命，是触及人们灵魂的、深刻的社会主义大革命，是社会主义革命发展到了崭新的阶段。名之为文化大革命，实际上是政治思想的大革命。现在看得很清楚，对于这场大革命，不少干部是缺乏思想准备的。旧的思想，遇到合适的气候，仍不免要从脑子里冒出来。这样，就难免犯错误，思想上难免有反复，甚至多次的反复。反复，没有什么要紧。它将使我们的干部得到锻炼提高，取得经验教训，更好地改造自己的世界观。同时，也会使无产阶级革命派和革命群众，懂得革命的道路是曲折的，不平坦的。
    一切干部，一定要跳出“私”字的小圈圈，想想七亿人民和几十亿人民，想想防止资本主义复辟的大问题，想想解放全人类的崇高理想，永远保持革命的朝气，相信群众，依靠群众，做群众的小学生，紧跟无产阶级伟大的导师毛主席革命到底。
