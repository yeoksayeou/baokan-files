The fierce battle in Hue City entered its third day. Mr. Yi, who lives on Dongbo Street, gazed at the flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fluttering over Hue City, and could not suppress the joy in his heart. He thought, "I am old, I cannot carry stretchers, nor can I transport grain or deliver ammunition. What should I do?" Thinking this, he had an idea and immediately picked up a basket to fetch tea leaves. Upon returning home, he busied himself boiling water and preparing tea cups. Then, Mr. Yi, with one hand holding a thermos and the other holding a few tea cups, rushed towards the front lines.

The gunfire in Hue City was still intense, but Mr. Yi, without hesitation, rushed to the liberation army's position near Meizhonghuan Road. The soldiers, seeing this elderly man risking his life to bring them tea and water, were deeply moved. The soldiers, while expressing their gratitude, also advised, "Grandpa, don't bring tea water anymore. It's too dangerous to be on the streets now!"

Mr. Yi earnestly said, "Comrades, please drink the tea. You are not afraid of shedding blood and sacrificing your lives in battle, and I, an old man, bringing you some tea water is nothing."

From then on, Mr. Yi brought tea water to the liberation army every day, covering all the nearby positions.

One day, at a certain position, the soldiers were having lunch. Mr. Yi came again and saw that the liberation army soldiers were eating only salted rice. He was so moved that he couldn't speak. The next day, before lunch time, Mr. Yi brought a pot of vegetables. The soldiers refused to accept it. Mr. Yi said excitedly, "I know that the liberation army has strict discipline and does not take even a needle or thread from the people. But this is the heartfelt wish of our entire family. If you all don't eat it, I will be angry." After saying this, he persuaded each of them until everyone agreed to eat, and then he happily returned home.

The liberation army soldiers looked at Mr. Yi's back, their hearts understanding that this was not just the wish of Mr. Yi's family, but the will of all the people of Hue City. They yearned for freedom so much and cherished and trusted the liberation army! The soldiers, while eating the vegetables brought by Mr. Yi, silently vowed: They must resolutely and thoroughly annihilate the enemy and fight to the end for the resistance against American aggression and for national salvation!

The Courageous Three-Wheel Cart Worker

The battle in Hue City was still raging fiercely, and the liberation army was tenaciously resisting the enemy's desperate counterattacks.

In the midst of deafening gunfire, where no one was seen on the streets of Dongbo District, an elderly man riding a three-wheel cart stopped near a liberation army position. A liberation army soldier walked over and asked with concern, "Grandpa, do you have something urgent to do here? It's really dangerous to be on the streets now."

"You are even more in danger!" the old worker replied. "I am here to help you. Give me a task!"

Before the soldier could respond, the old worker said excitedly, "Although I am old, I still have strength and a cart. I really want to contribute to the revolution, whether it's transporting wounded soldiers or carrying anything you need."

The soldiers were deeply moved and said warmly, "Grandpa, we are very grateful for your intention. But it's not safe for you to be on the streets now."

The old worker was afraid that the liberation army, considering his safety, would not give him a task, so he said, "You can rest assured. I am very familiar with the streets of Hue City. I know which roads are passable and which are not."

From that day on, in the areas controlled by the liberation army, this old worker could be seen every day, busily pedaling his three-wheel cart, sometimes transporting wounded soldiers, sometimes loading ammunition and grain, speeding through the smoky streets of Hue.

A needle, a thread, a heartfelt wish; the bond between soldiers and civilians runs deep.

Ten thousand new clothes sent to the front lines, inspiring heroes to fight against the American army.

　　军民鱼水情
    易大爷的心意
    顺化市的激烈战斗进入第三天。住在东波街的易大爷凝望着飘扬在顺化市上空的越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，抑制不住心头的喜悦。他想：“我老了，不能抬担架，也不能运粮食、送炮弹，我应该作些什么呢？”想到这里，他若有所悟，立刻提着篮子去拿茶叶，回家后，又是烧开水，又是准备茶杯，忙个不停。然后，易大爷一手提着水壶，一手拿着几个茶杯，便往阵地跑去。
    顺化市的枪声还十分密集，易大爷不顾一切，一股劲儿跑到梅叔鸾路附近的解放军阵地。战士们见到这位老大爷冒着生命危险给他们送来茶水，十分感动。战士们边感谢边劝告说：“大爷，你别再送茶水来了，这时候在街上跑多危险啊！”
    易大爷恳切地说：“同志们，喝茶吧，你们战斗不怕流血牺牲，我老汉送些茶水算得了什么。”
    从此，易大爷天天为解放军送茶水，他跑遍了附近各个阵地。
    一天，某阵地正在开午饭，易大爷又来了，他看到解放军战士吃的只有盐巴和饭，激动得说不出话来。第二天，还没到开午饭时间，易大爷便送来了一锅菜。战士们那里肯收。易大爷激动地说：“我知道，解放军纪律严明，不拿群众一针一线，可是，这是我们一家人的一片心意，你们如果都不吃，我可要生气了。”易大爷说罢又一个一个地劝，直到大家都答应吃了，他才愉快地走回家去。
    解放军战士激动地望着易大爷的背影，他们心里明白，这不仅是易大爷一家人的心愿，而是全顺化市同胞的心意，他们是多么地渴望自由，多么爱护和信任解放军啊！战士们一边吃着易大爷送来的菜，一边默默地发誓：一定要坚决彻底消灭敌人，为抗美救国而战斗到底！
    勇敢的三轮车工人
    战斗仍在顺化市激烈地进行着，解放军顽强地抗击着进行疯狂反扑的敌人。
    在枪声震耳，看不到一个行人的东波区一条马路上，有一位脚踏三轮车的老大爷在解放军的一处阵地附近停下来。一位解放军战士走过去关心地问道：
    “大伯，您到这里来有什么要紧的事吗？这时候在马路上走实在太危险了。”
    “说危险，你们就更危险了！”老工人回答说，“我是来帮你们忙的。你们交任务吧！”
    还没等那位战士回答，老工人又激动地说：“我虽然老了，但是还有力气，又有车。我很希望能为革命出点力，或者运送伤员，或者运载你们要运的任何东西。”
    战士们十分感动，亲切地说：“大伯，我们非常感谢您的心意。但是，您这时候在马路上走是不能保证安全的。”
    老工人很怕解放军由于考虑到他的安全而不肯交给他任务，就说：“你们放心吧。顺化市的街道我非常熟悉，我知道那条路能走，那条路不能走。”
    从那天起，在解放军控制的街区，每天都能看到这位老工人繁忙地踏着三轮车，时而运送伤员，时而装载弹药、粮食，飞驰在硝烟弥漫的顺化街头。

　　一线一针一片心，军民鱼水情谊深。
　　新衣万件送前线，鼓舞英雄打美军。
