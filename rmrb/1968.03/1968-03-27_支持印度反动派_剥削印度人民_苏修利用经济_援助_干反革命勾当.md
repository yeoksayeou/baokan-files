According to a Xinhua News Agency report from New Delhi: A trade agreement recently signed between the Soviet revisionist clique and the Indian reactionary government has revealed the Soviet revisionists' use of trade and economic "aid" to support Indian reactionaries, deceive, and exploit the Indian people.

According to the Indian News Agency, the Soviet Union and the Indian government signed a trade agreement in New Delhi on the 13th, stipulating that India will provide the Soviet Union with 10,000 railway freight car bodies over the next four years. According to reports, "the final contract to be signed in Moscow in four months will be India's largest export contract."

The Soviet revisionists' "generous" purchase of a large number of freight cars from the Indian reactionaries has ulterior motives. In recent years, the Soviet revisionists have heavily invested in India, helping the Indian reactionaries establish a number of bureaucratic capitalist industrial enterprises. These enterprises have low operating rates, and their products are in large quantities. This is a heavy burden imposed on the Indian working people by the Soviet revisionists through the Indian reactionaries. For example, in the city of Ranchi, Bihar State, the heavy machinery plant built by the Soviet revisionists to help the Indian reactionaries has a capital expenditure of approximately $22 million, but in the past seven years, it has only produced goods worth $1 million.

    支持印度反动派　剥削印度人民
    苏修利用经济“援助”干反革命勾当
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：苏修叛徒集团同印度反动政府最近签订的一项贸易协定，暴露了苏修利用贸易和经济“援助”来支持印度反动派，欺骗和剥削印度人民的反动目的。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，苏联和印度政府十三日在新德里签订的贸易协定，规定印度在今后四年内向苏联提供一万个铁路货车车皮。据报道，“四个月后在莫斯科签订的最后的合同，将是印度签订的最大的一个出口合同。”
    苏修这样“慷慨”地向印度反动派购买大量货车，是有其不可告人的目的的。苏修近年来在印度大量投资，帮助印度反动派建立了一批官僚资本主义的工业企业。这些企业开工率很低，产品大量积压。这是苏修通过印度反动派强加给印度劳动人民的沉重负担。例如在比哈尔邦兰奇地方，苏修帮助印度反动派修建的重型机械厂，资本支出约合两千二百万美元，但在过去七年中总共只生产出价值一百万美元的产品。
