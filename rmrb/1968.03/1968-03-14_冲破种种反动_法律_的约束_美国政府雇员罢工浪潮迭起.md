Breaking Through Various Reactionary "Laws" Constraints
American Government Employees' Strike Waves Rise

According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington reports: The American ruling class's policy of external aggressive invasion and internal intensified oppression and exploitation of the working people has provoked increasingly strong resistance from the American working people. Like industrial workers, many government employees have also broken through the government's various "laws" designed to maintain its reactionary rule and prohibit civil servants from striking, launching wave after wave of strikes.

Following the ninety-eight teacher strikes last year, teachers across the United States have once again started striking at the beginning of this year, demanding wage increases and improved teaching conditions. Nearly 30,000 public elementary school teachers in Florida began a statewide strike on February 19, demanding wage increases, increased educational funding, and the right to speak on educational policies and administrative management.

Teachers in Cincinnati and Portsmouth, Ohio, also went on strike. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, about 1,000 teachers defied a court order and began striking on February 29. This was followed by 1,500 teachers in San Francisco starting their strike on March 1.

Meanwhile, 10,000 sanitation workers employed by the New York City government have been on strike since February 2, demanding wage increases and contract signings. The reactionary authorities invoked various laws prohibiting government employees from striking, but the strikers were not intimidated. After the New York sanitation workers' strike achieved partial victory and temporarily ended, more than 1,000 sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, began striking on February 12. They refused to comply with the mayor's order for workers to return to work by the 15th. On the 22nd and 23rd, the striking workers marched to the city council and through the city, engaging in a struggle with the police sent to suppress the demonstration. 

American bourgeois newspapers are worried that these strikes indicate that government departments, which have been relatively quiet due to various reactionary "laws" restricting strikes, are becoming increasingly "unrestful."

　　冲破种种反动“法律”的约束
    美国政府雇员罢工浪潮迭起
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国统治集团对外实行疯狂侵略，对内加紧压迫和剥削劳动人民的政策引起了美国劳动人民日益强烈的反抗。象产业工人一样，许多政府雇员也冲破政府为维护它的反动统治、禁止公务人员罢工而制定的种种“法律”的约束，掀起了一次又一次的罢工浪潮。
    继去年举行了九十八起罢教斗争之后，美国各地的教师今年一开始又纷纷罢教，要求增加工资和改善教学条件。弗罗里达州将近三万名公立小学教师从二月十九日起开始了全州范围的罢教，要求增加工资、增加教育经费，要求在教育方针、行政管理方面的发言权。
    辛辛那提和俄亥州朴次茅斯的教师也举行了罢教。在宾夕法尼亚州的匹兹堡，大约一千名教师不顾法院的禁令于二月二十九日开始罢教。接着，旧金山的一千五百名教师在三月一日开始罢教。
    与此同时，纽约市当局雇用的一万名清洁工人从二月二日起坚持了九天的罢工，要求增加工资和签订合同。反动当局搬用种种禁止政府雇员罢工的法令，但是威吓不了罢工者。在纽约清洁工人的罢工取得部分胜利暂告结束后，田纳西州孟菲斯的一千多名清洁工人也于二月十二日开始罢工。他们拒不执行市长强令工人十五日复工的命令。二十二日、二十三日，罢工工人到市议会门前和市区游行示威，同派去镇压示威的警察进行了一场搏斗。
    美国资产阶级报刊担心，这些罢工预示着，过去由于种种反动“法律”的限制而罢工运动显得比较沉寂的政府部门也越来越“不平静”了。
