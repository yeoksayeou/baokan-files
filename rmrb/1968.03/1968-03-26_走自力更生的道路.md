The path indicated by Chairman Mao for us poor and lower-middle peasants is to take the road of collectivization. We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely follow the instructions of Chairman Mao and have led the way from mutual aid teams, cooperatives to people's communes. The road has become wider and wider, and the collective economy has prospered year by year.

During the period of temporary economic difficulties, the Chinese Khrushchev spread the black wind of "three independences and one contract." This black wind quickly blew into our Lankao and even into our Duanyangshu Brigade. The agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Lankao and the capitalist forces in the countryside, as if they had found a treasure, kept shouting about "dividing land," "borrowing land," and "contracting production to households." The "three independences and one contract" were implemented, and the collective economy suffered. Our once surplus-producing brigade was turned into a deficit-producing brigade. We poor and lower-middle peasants were all indignant and said: We poor and lower-middle peasants have suffered enough in the old society, and we have always been enemies with individual farming. We firmly oppose the black wind of "three independences and one contract."

Just as the two classes and two roads were about to decide the outcome, Chairman Mao sent us a good secretary, Comrade Jiao Yulu. He brought Chairman Mao's precious book to Lankao, to Duanyangshu Brigade, and to our homes of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought and under the direct leadership of Comrade Jiao Yulu, we focused on class education, held remembrance meetings to recall bitterness and sweetness, invited old poor peasants who had deep hatred to recount the bitterness of the old society, the sweetness of the new society, the bitterness of "three independences and one contract," and the sweetness of the collective economy. We spoke of our boundless love for Chairman Mao and our love for the collective economy. Everyone said: The poverty of these few years is because the bad elements led us down a winding and dark path; now we must break with it completely, take the road to collective prosperity, the road of self-reliance, the road of socialism, in a word, the road indicated by Chairman Mao. At the remembrance meeting, some comrades who had been momentarily blinded by the black wind exposed the crimes of the bad elements inciting individual farming on the spot, further enlightening the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of comrades. Everyone expressed: No matter how big the black wind blows, with Chairman Mao at the helm, we poor and lower-middle peasants dare to sail against the wind and dare to climb the Flame Mountain. The road indicated by Chairman Mao, we will definitely take.

When developing production lacked livestock, we held a meeting of the masses to discuss. The poor and lower-middle peasants firmly said: "We will not stretch our hands up or out, but rely on the masses, rely on the collective, and be self-reliant." At this time, someone sneered and said, "The masses, what can the masses do now?" I heard this pouring of cold water and thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes." I immediately seriously said to him: "Do not underestimate the masses. Chiang Kai-shek's eight hundred thousand troops were defeated by Chairman Mao leading the masses. As long as the poor and lower-middle peasants unite as one, today's difficulties are nothing." My words had not yet finished when a poor peasant comrade stood up excitedly and said: "As the saying goes, the big river dries up, the small river dries up. Without the collective, how can there be individuals! This is the money I earned today pulling a cart, let the brigade buy livestock with it." A five-guarantee household woman insisted on giving the money she earned from selling eggs to the brigade to buy livestock. Everyone said she was old and persuaded her to keep it for herself. She said word by word: "Although this money is little, it is my heart following Chairman Mao." In this way, we tightly relied on the collective, relied on the masses, and resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions to overcome one difficulty after another, to withstand the black wind blown by the Chinese Khrushchev, to smash the sabotage of the class enemies, and on the road of the people's commune, our Duanyangshu became a surplus-producing brigade again! The dream of the Chinese Khrushchev to undermine the foundation of socialism became a bubble.

Comrade Jiao Yulu summarized the road we have taken as the "Duanyangshu Road." In fact, this road is the road of socialism, the road of the collective economy, the road of self-reliance, the bright road personally indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao. We poor and lower-middle peasants will follow this road all the way to communism.

    走自力更生的道路
    河南省兰考县革命委员会委员、双杨树大队党支部书记　王法祥
    毛主席给俺贫下中农指出的方向，就是走集体化的道路。俺贫下中农坚决照毛主席他老人家的指示办事，从互助组、合作社到人民公社，样样跑在前头，路子越走越宽敞，集体经济一年比一年兴旺。
    正当三年经济暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫刮起了“三自一包”的黑风，这股黑风很快地刮到了俺兰考，也刮到了俺双杨树大队。中国赫鲁晓夫在兰考的代理人和农村的资本主义势力，象得了宝贝一样，天天吵吵着要“分地”、要“借地”、要“包产到户”。“三自一包”搞来搞去，集体经济遭了殃，把我们好好的一个余粮队搞成了缺粮队。我们贫下中农都气不平地说：俺贫下中农吃够了旧社会的苦头，跟搞单干从来就是冤家对头，我们坚决反对“三自一包”的黑风。
    正在这两个阶级、两条道路决一死战的关口，毛主席给俺们派来了好书记焦裕禄同志。他带着毛主席的宝书来到了兰考，来到了双杨树大队，来到了俺贫下中农家里。
    在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，在焦裕禄同志的直接领导下，我们大抓阶级教育，召开忆苦思甜会，请苦大仇深的老贫农诉旧社会的苦，讲新社会的甜，诉“三自一包”的苦，讲集体经济的甜，讲对毛主席的无限热爱，对集体经济的热爱。大家都说：这几年的穷，是因为坏人带我们走了一条曲曲弯弯的黑路；现在咱要和它一刀两断，走集体富裕的道路，走自力更生的道路，走社会主义的道路，一句话，走毛主席指引的路。诉苦会上，有些一时被黑风刮迷了眼睛的社员，当场揭发了坏人煽动闹单干的罪行，更擦亮了贫下中农和广大社员的眼睛，大家纷纷表示：黑风刮得再大，有毛主席掌舵，我们贫下中农就是敢开顶风船，敢上火焰山，毛主席指引的路我们走定了。
    发展生产缺少牲口，我们就召开社员会让大家讨论。贫下中农坚定地说：“我们两手不向上伸，不向外伸，要依靠群众、依靠集体、自力更生。”这时有人在一旁轻蔑地嘿嘿了两声说：“群众，群众现在有啥法啊？”我一听这泼冷水的话，想起毛主席的教导：“群众是真正的英雄”。我马上严肃地对他说：“你不要小看群众，蒋介石的八百万军队就是毛主席带领人民群众把它打垮的。只要贫下中农拧成一股绳，今天这点困难，又算个啥？……”我的话音未落，一个贫农社员激动地站起来说：“俗话说，大河没水小河干，没有集体那有个人啊！这是我今天拉架子车挣的钱，交给队里买牲口吧。”一个五保户妇女说啥也要把她卖鸡蛋的钱交给队里买牲口，大家都说她年纪大了，劝她留着自己用。她一字一句地说：“这几个钱虽然少，可这是我跟着毛主席走的一颗心。”就这样，我们紧紧地依靠集体，依靠群众，坚决按毛主席的指示办事，克服了一个又一个的困难，顶住了中国赫鲁晓夫刮起的黑风，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏，在人民公社的大路上，我们双杨树又变成了余粮队！中国赫鲁晓夫梦想挖社会主义墙脚的阴谋成了泡影。
    焦裕禄同志把俺们走过来的道路总结为：“双杨树的道路”。其实这个道路，就是社会主义的道路，集体经济的道路，自力更生的道路，是伟大领袖毛主席亲自给俺们指引的光明大道。俺贫下中农要沿着这条道路，一直走到共产主义。
