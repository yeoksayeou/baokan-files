Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, sent an urgent telegram to Phoumi on the 20th, denouncing his actions in the face of the U.S. attempt to send troops to Laos to expand its aggression in Laos and South Vietnam, which are aimed at saving its shameful failure. Phoumi, on February 16, made a statement to the UPI correspondent: "I will request foreign military intervention in Laos."

Prince Souphanouvong pointed out in the telegram that anyone who trusts in the strength of the United States and continues to serve its secret plots will not escape the same fate as the United States.

The telegram said that if the U.S. imperialists persist in their stubborn and adventurous actions of sending troops to expand the war of aggression in Laos, the Lao Patriotic Front will, together with the people of the whole country, under the support of brotherly countries, launch a fierce and powerful counterattack and will certainly achieve a thorough victory. The United States and its followers must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from their actions.

The Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee spokesman issued a statement on the 26th, strongly protesting against the recent decision of the Indian and Canadian representatives of the International Control Commission in Laos to go to the Lower Laos region to "study the military situation," which is an illegal action.

The statement said that the current Vientiane pro-American puppet government is launching a smear campaign against the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to cover up its failures, deceive public opinion, and pave the way for new military adventures by U.S. aggressors in Laos.

The statement said that the current Vientiane puppet government was the result of a military coup staged by the U.S. and the right-wing military clique in Laos on April 19, 1964. It is not the tripartite national unity government established on the basis of the agreements in Geneva and the Plain of Jars. Therefore, it has no right to request the International Control Commission in Laos to carry out any work in the name of the tripartite national unity government.

The statement pointed out that the Lao Patriotic Front considers the recent actions of the Indian and Canadian representatives to be a deliberate violation of Laos' sovereignty and a deliberate violation of the 1962 Geneva Agreement, aimed at serving the U.S.'s new military adventurism.

The statement finally demanded that the Indian and Canadian representatives must stop the above illegal actions and must fully respect Laos' sovereignty and the 1962 Geneva Agreement. If the Indian and Canadian representatives insist on continuing their illegal actions, they must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from their actions.

    老挝爱国战线党强烈抗议国际委员会印度加拿大代表侵犯老挝主权的非法行动
    新华社康开二十九日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王二十日打紧急电报给富马，谴责他在美国为了挽救它在老挝和越南南方的可耻失败而阴谋向老挝派遣美军扩大对老挝的侵略战争的情况下，采取了违背祖国和人民利益的行动，于二月十六日，向美国合众国际社记者发表声明说：“将要求外国对老挝进行军事干涉”。
    苏发努冯亲王在电报中指出，谁要是迷信美国的力量，一味沿着为美国不可告人的阴谋效劳的道路走下去，那么，他将逃脱不了同美国一样的命运。
    电报说，如果美帝国主义一味顽固和冒险地派遣军队扩大侵略老挝的战争，老挝爱国战线党将同全国人民一起，在兄弟国家的支持下，进行激烈和有力的回击，并且一定取得彻底的胜利。美国和美国的追随者必须对由他们的行动所引起的一切后果承担全部责任。
    新华社河内二十七日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人二十六日发表一项声明，强烈抗议老挝国际委员会的印度和加拿大代表最近决定前往下寮地区进行所谓“研究军事情况”的非法行动。
    声明说，目前，万象亲美傀儡政权正在对老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国发动一个污蔑攻势，以便掩盖他们的失败，欺骗舆论，为美国侵略者在老挝推行新的军事冒险计划扫清道路。
    声明说，目前的万象傀儡政权是由美国和老挝右派军阀集团一九六四年四月十九日举行的军事政变产生的，它完全不是在苏黎世和查尔平原的各项协议的基础上成立的老挝三方民族团结政府。因此，它无权以老挝三方民族团结政府的名义要求老挝国际委员会进行任何一项工作。
    声明指出，老挝爱国战线党认为印度和加拿大代表最近的行动是蓄意侵犯老挝的主权，蓄意违反一九六二年日内瓦协议，以便为美国的新的军事冒险计划效劳。
    声明最后表示坚决要求印度和加拿大代表必须停止上述的非法行动，必须彻底尊重老挝主权和一九六二年的日内瓦协议。如果印度和加拿大代表一味继续进行非法行动，那么，他们就必须对由他们所引起的一切后果承担全部责任。
