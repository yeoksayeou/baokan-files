	As the financial crisis in the Western world intensifies and the position of the dollar is on the brink of collapse, French President Charles de Gaulle delivered a speech on March 20, once again launching a fierce attack on the dollar's hegemonic position in the Western monetary system, dealing a heavy blow to the Johnson administration, which has been hardest hit by this crisis.

	De Gaulle made this speech during a French cabinet meeting discussing the current financial crisis in the Western world. He said that the current monetary system, which is based on the "privilege" of the dollar, is not only unfair but also unsustainable in the future. He firmly opposed the United States' attempt to impose this system for a longer period and stated that if this were to continue, France would reserve the right to take "independent action."

	De Gaulle also addressed the situation where the United States has increasingly less gold, reiterating France's stance that a Western monetary system based on gold should be implemented to strike at U.S. hegemony. He also demanded the establishment of a new Western monetary organization where France would have a greater voice.

	French Foreign Minister Michel Debré, in a speech on March 19, also emphasized that the current Western monetary system, which is advantageous to the United States, "cannot exist forever." France has already "drawn its own conclusions" when exchanging dollars for gold. Moreover, Debré mocked the United States for having a "severe deficit" in its international balance of payments for the past seven or eight years and for being in a "far from comfortable" situation. Regarding the recent Washington meeting convened by the United States to save the dollar, Debré believed that "no clear achievements" were made.

	In the cutthroat competition among imperialist countries, the French monopoly capital group has always sought to undermine the dollar and elevate the status of the French franc. They have repeatedly exchanged dollars for gold, exacerbating the dollar crisis. French media revealed that since the devaluation of the pound in November last year, France has played a significant role in every wave of dollar selling and gold buying in the capitalist world. Now, the financial crisis that has brought the credibility of the dollar to the brink of collapse is sweeping across the entire capitalist world. The French government, while deeply concerned about the chaos in the Western monetary system that could bring adverse effects to France, is intensifying its rivalry with the United States, seizing every opportunity to launch attacks.

	Western observers pointed out that De Gaulle's speech is "a declaration of war" for the United States, which is currently seeking support everywhere. The British "News of the World" also believed that De Gaulle's speech is a "direct opposition to U.S. policy," adding "pain upon pain" for the United States.

    给陷于危机重重的约翰逊政府一闷棍
    戴高乐再次向美元霸权地位开火
    要求成立法国有更大发言权的西方世界货币组织
    新华社巴黎二十一日电　在西方世界金融危机猛烈发展、美元地位濒临彻底垮台的时候，法国总统戴高乐二十日发表谈话，再次激烈攻击美元在西方世界货币制度中的霸权地位，给了遭到这次危机最沉重打击的约翰逊政府一闷棍。
    戴高乐是在二十日法国内阁讨论当前西方世界的金融危机时发表这次谈话的。他说，西方世界以美元“特权为基础的现行（货币）制度不仅是不公平的，而且今后也是行不通的”。他表示坚决反对美国“硬要更长时间地把这种制度强加于人”，否则的话，法国将保留“行动自由”。
    戴高乐还针对美国现在手中黄金越来越少的情况，重申法国的主张，要求实行一种以黄金为基础的西方货币制度，以打击美国的霸权。他还要求成立新的法国在其中有更大发言权的西方世界货币组织。
    法国外长德姆维尔在十九日的一次谈话中也强调目前有利于美国的西方货币制度“决不能永远存在下去”，法国在用美元换取黄金的时候已经“得出了自己的结论”。不仅如此，德姆维尔还奚落美国
  “七八年内国际收支一直是严重逆差”，“有巨额赤字”，“处于决不是好过的境况中”。对于美国为挽救美元而在最近召集的华盛顿会议，德姆维尔认为“没有取得任何明确的成就”。
    在帝国主义国家间尔虞我诈的角逐中，法国垄断资本集团一直设法打击美元，抬高法国法郎的地位。他们不断地以手中的美元向美国兑换黄金，以加剧美元危机。法国报刊透露，在去年十一月英镑贬值以来资本主义世界掀起的每次抛售美元抢购黄金的风潮中，法国都起了推波助澜的作用。现在，使美元信用濒临彻底完蛋的金融危机正席卷整个资本主义世界，法国政府一方面十分担心西方货币制度的混乱也会给法国带来不良后果，但同时加紧同美国争霸，不断乘机对美国发动攻势。
    西方人士指出，戴高乐的这次讲话，对目前正在到处寻求支持的美国来说，无异是“一次宣战”。英国的《新闻晚报》也认为，戴高乐的谈话是“对美国政策直截了当的反对”，使美国“痛苦加上痛苦”。
