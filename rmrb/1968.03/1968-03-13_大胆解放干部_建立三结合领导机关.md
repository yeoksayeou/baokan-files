The revolutionary teachers and students of our school, under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's March 7th directive, with the enthusiastic help of the PLA, overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, liberated cadres, and established the revolutionary committee of the school. Now, old and new cadres are helping each other and moving forward together, determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

After achieving revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes, how do we closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and quickly realize the revolutionary three-in-one combination? Reviewing the battle's course, we deeply understand that by strictly following Chairman Mao's March 7th directive, educating revolutionary teachers and students to trust and rely on the majority of cadres, guiding revolutionary cadres to correctly handle mass movements, and actively going to the masses to reveal themselves, we can quickly realize the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Our school has seven cadres, six of whom were liberated before the revolutionary great unity. After achieving revolutionary great unity, with the help of the PLA, we followed Chairman Mao's March 7th directive on "establishing a three-in-one leadership body" and, during the preparation for the establishment of the revolutionary committee, proposed to all revolutionary teachers and students the issue of establishing a revolutionary three-in-one leadership team. Some people thought: the school's leading cadres all implemented the revisionist educational line and the bourgeois reactionary line; they must be overthrown or at least sidelined. Others said: our school's leadership team should simply be led by the PLA, and so on. Facing this situation, with the help of the PLA, we organized all revolutionary teachers and students to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's March 7th directive on "implementing Marx's teaching that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself" and Chairman Mao's latest directives on cadre issues, and to deeply discuss the situation in our school.

During the discussion, revolutionary teachers and students studied Chairman Mao's latest directives on cadre issues; they criticized China's Khrushchev for formulating and promoting the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number," and they talked about the comprehensive work and entire history of revolutionary cadres. Through study and discussion, the broad revolutionary teachers and students corrected their past erroneous view that cadres were a complete mess. They said: in the past, when criticizing cadres, we saw only their flaws and mistakes. Now, using Chairman Mao's cadre policy to photograph cadres, we see that they have many advantages and strengths. We should follow Chairman Mao's teaching to "trust and rely on the majority of cadres" and combine with the revolutionary cadres of our school. This change made us realize that the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students listen most to Chairman Mao. As long as we seriously implement Chairman Mao's March 7th directive and his latest directives on cadre issues, they can comprehensively, historically, and dialectically view cadres.

The issue of whether revolutionary cadres should be combined was just resolved, but the issue of combining whom arose again, with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism blocking the way. At that time, the two factions were at loggerheads, and the focus of the debate was on the issue of the original acting principal, Liu Zhiming. Liu Zhiming was promoted as acting principal during the later stage of the Four Clean-ups movement. He has a good background, is loyal to the Party, and has a strong revolutionary spirit; but sometimes his work style is not democratic enough, and he is detached from the masses. During the debate on his issue, one faction thought he was the best cadre in the school and should be combined with, even making him the first in command. The other faction, however, thought he had made mistakes and should not be combined with. The two factions held fast to their own views and would not give in.

In the study class, the PLA enthusiastically helped revolutionary teachers and students overcome factionalism, fiercely fight against selfishness, and correctly distinguish between the main and minor aspects, the major and minor issues of revolutionary cadres. The leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations first fiercely fought against factionalism and deeply excavated the roots of selfishness. The head of the faction that originally did not agree to combine with Liu Zhiming said: "I looked at cadres with factionalist glasses, seeing only the minor aspects and not the main aspects, seeing only the minor issues and not the major issues." Led by the heads, revolutionary teachers and students actively revealed their selfishness, fought against factionalism, and strongly promoted the establishment of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

After overcoming factionalism and eliminating selfishness, the broad revolutionary teachers and students further corrected their attitude towards cadres, and the relationship between cadres and the masses improved. However, some teachers and students still did not trust the cadres, fearing that they would be made to "wear small shoes" in the future. Some cadres still had a belly full of grievances and did not want to work. Some cadres did not dare to open their hearts to the masses, did not want to approach the masses. This situation directly affected the establishment of the revolutionary three-in-one combination. While the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students were having a big debate on the cadre issue, the PLA helped us hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class. In the study class, the PLA guided us to bring actual problems, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, methods, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The PLA encouraged revolutionary cadres to remove the "fear" character and replace it with the "dare" character; remove the "selfish" character and replace it with the "public" character; remove "trusting oneself" and replace it with "trusting the masses," and go to the masses for a "frontline" revelation. Revolutionary cadre Du Huizhu is a disabled soldier. Due to shortcomings and mistakes in his work, he was "dismissed" by the masses, and he had grievances in his heart, thinking of throwing in the towel. After the PLA and revolutionary teachers and students helped him many times, he studied Chairman Mao's latest directives on cadre issues with them repeatedly, raised his consciousness, and actively went to the young comrades to check his shortcomings and mistakes, listening to their criticism and opinions. The young comrades enthusiastically helped him analyze the causes of his mistakes, which moved him greatly. He said excitedly: "These criticisms are both stimulating injections and preventive injections. Injecting a stimulating injection can rescue me from illness; injecting a preventive injection can prevent me from getting sick and making fewer mistakes."

On the other hand, to solve the relationship between cadres and the masses, we must firmly grasp class education. The PLA inspired us to go to the masses and, together with revolutionary teachers and students, recall bitterness and think of sweetness, recalling the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society; recalling the bitterness of the revisionist educational line and the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary educational line. Through recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, revolutionary cadres raised their revolutionary consciousness and corrected their attitude towards mass movements. At the same time, revolutionary cadres and revolutionary teachers and students hated China's Khrushchev even more, hated the "selfish" character in their minds, and loved Chairman Mao and class brothers even more. After recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, the original acting principal Liu Zhiming further raised his class consciousness. He said: "I am a poor peasant's child, but I forgot my roots and implemented China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line and bourgeois reactionary line. I truly let down Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. In the future, I will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." He made four "frontline" revelations at teacher and student meetings, which were warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

Under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's March 7th directive and with the help of the PLA, our school established the revolutionary committee on December 29th of last year. Now, we new and old cadres have formed "one helping one" and "one red pair," helping each other and doing well the work entrusted to us by the Party and Chairman Mao, carrying the proletarian educational revolution through to the end!

　　大胆解放干部  建立三结合领导机关
    我校革命师生，在毛主席“三·七”指示的光辉照耀下，在解放军的热情帮助下，克服了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，解放了干部，建立了校革命委员会。现在，新老干部相互帮助，共同前进，决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
　　河北省怀来县沙城中学革命委员会
    实现以教学班为基础的革命大联合后，怎样紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，迅速实现革命三结合呢？回顾战斗的历程，我们深刻认识到：不折不扣地按照毛主席的“三·七”指示办事，教育革命师生相信和依靠干部的大多数，引导革命干部正确对待群众运动，主动到群众中亮相，就能迅速实现革命三结合。
    我们学校有七个干部，其中有六个在革命大联合前就解放了。实现革命大联合以后，在解放军帮助下，我们遵照毛主席“三·七”指示中关于“建立三结合领导机关”的教导，在筹备成立革委会的过程中，向全校革命师生提出了建立革命三结合领导班子的问题。有的人认为：学校的领导干部，都执行过修正主义教育路线和资产阶级反动路线，不打倒也得靠边站。也有的人说：我们学校的领导班子，干脆让解放军来负责，等等。针对这种情况，我们在解放军帮助下，组织全校革命师生，反复学习毛主席“三·七”指示中“实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导”和毛主席有关干部问题的最新指示，结合本校情况进行深入的讨论。
    在讨论中，革命师生大学毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示；大批中国赫鲁晓夫制定和推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，大谈革命干部的全面工作，全部历史。通过学习和讨论，广大革命师生扭转了过去认为干部是一团糟的错误看法。他们说：过去在批判干部的时候，把干部看得浑身都是缺点、错误。现在用毛主席的干部政策给干部照像，就看到他们有很多优点、长处。我们应该按照毛主席的教导“相信和依靠干部的大多数”，结合我校的革命干部。这一变化使我们认识到，红卫兵小将和革命师生最听毛主席的话。只要认真落实毛主席“三·七”指示和关于干部问题的最新指示，他们就能全面地、历史地、一分为二地看待干部。
    革命干部应该不应该结合的问题刚刚解决，在结合谁的问题上，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性又跳出来拦路。当时两派顶牛，辩论的焦点是原代理校长柳渍明的问题。柳渍明是在四清运动后期提拔的代理校长，他出身好，对党忠心耿耿，革命干劲大；但他有时工作作风不够民主，脱离群众。在辩论他的问题时，一派认为他是学校最好的干部，要结合，并让他当第一把手。另一派却认为，他有错误不能结合。两派各持己见，互不相让。
　　在学习班里，解放军热情帮助革命师生克服派性，狠斗“私”字，正确区分革命干部的主流和支流、大节和小节。革命群众组织头头首先狠斗派性，深挖私根。原先不同意结合柳渍明一派的头头说：“我带着派性眼镜看干部，只看支流，不看主流，只看小节，不看大节。”在头头带动下，革命师生积极亮“私”字，斗派性，有力地促进了革命三结合的建立。
    经过克服派性，破私立公，广大革命师生进一步端正了对干部的态度，干群关系有了好转。但仍然有部分师生对干部不放心，怕将来给自己“小鞋穿”。有的干部心里还是憋着一肚子怨气，不想干。有的干部不敢跟群众交心亮底，不愿意接近群众。这种情况直接影响革命三结合的建立。在全校革命师生对干部问题进行大辩论的同时，解放军帮助我们举办毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，解放军引导我们带着实际问题，活学活用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。解放军鼓励革命干部去掉“怕”字，换上“敢”字；去掉“私”字，换上“公”字；去掉“相信自己”，换上“相信群众”，到群众中进行“火线”亮相。革命干部杜怀渚是个残废军人，由于工作中有缺点和错误，挨了群众“轰”，他心里有怨气，一度想撂挑子。经过解放军和革命师生多次帮助，与他一起反复学习了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，他提高了认识，就主动到小将中去检查自己的缺点和错误，听取小将的批评和意见。小将们热情帮助他分析犯错误的原因，使他很感动。他激动地说：“这些批评有的是强心针，有的是预防针。打上强心针，能从病中挽救我；打上预防针，能使我不得病，少犯错误。”
    解决干群关系的另一方面，就是狠抓阶级教育。解放军启发我们到群众中去和革命师生一起进行忆苦思甜，大忆旧社会的苦，大讲新社会的甜；大忆修正主义教育路线的苦，大讲毛主席革命教育路线的甜。通过忆苦思甜，革命干部提高了革命自觉性，端正了对待群众运动的态度。同时，革命干部和革命师生都更加痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫，痛恨头脑中的“私”字，更加无限热爱毛主席，热爱阶级兄弟。原代理校长柳渍明经过忆苦思甜，进一步提高了阶级觉悟。他说：“我是个贫农的孩子，可我却忘了本，执行了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线和资产阶级反动路线，我真对不起毛主席，对不起共产党。今后，我一定牢记毛主席的教导，永远不忘阶级斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”他分别在师生大会上进行四次“火线”亮相，受到了广大革命师生的热烈欢迎。
    在毛主席“三·七”指示光辉照耀下，在解放军的帮助下，我校于去年十二月二十九日成立了校革命委员会。现在，我们新老干部结成“一帮一”“一对红”，互相帮助，共同做好党和毛主席交给我们的工作，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
