	Colombian revolutionaries have recently established several Mao Zedong Thought study groups. In their study of Chairman Mao's works, these groups have paid attention to linking the study with the actual revolutionary struggle in their country. Through their studies, they have strengthened their confidence in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, recognizing that only by correctly applying Mao Zedong Thought can they achieve victory in the revolutionary armed struggle.

	These Mao Zedong Thought study groups have recently studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On Some Important Problems in the Current Policy of Our Party," "Star Sparks Will Become a Prairie Fire," and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." After studying the works of the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, the members of the study groups said that Chairman Mao's brilliant assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers "developed Marxism-Leninism, enabling the people of the whole world not to be frightened by the military might of imperialism, and daring to struggle against imperialism and its lackeys."

	They linked this to the revolutionary movement in Colombia, criticizing the erroneous thinking of some people in Colombia who overestimate the enemy's strength and dare not struggle. They pointed out that whether to be frightened by the enemy's strength or to dare to struggle and dare to win is a struggle between two lines of thought. They quoted Chairman Mao's teaching: "We have every reason to despise them. We have the confidence and the ability to defeat all the internal and external enemies of the Chinese people."

	The members of the study groups also quoted Chairman Mao's words: "But in each specific struggle (whether military, political, economic, or ideological), we must never underestimate the enemy. On the contrary, we must take the enemy seriously and concentrate our forces to fight, in order to win victory." After studying this teaching, the members of the study groups said: "Our own experience has proven that Mao Zedong Thought is completely correct."

	In their studies, the groups also criticized the pessimistic attitudes of some people towards the revolution and their illusions about the Colombian reactionaries, pointing out that the revolutionary situation in Colombia is excellent: the people are increasingly unable to bear the exploitation and oppression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the people are gradually rejecting reformism, more and more peasants are refusing to participate in the farce of elections staged by the reactionary ruling class, and the broad masses of the people are preparing to launch a magnificent struggle. They said: "Colombia is also 'full of dry wood,' 'star sparks can become a prairie fire.'"

	The members of the study groups also criticized the erroneous thinking of some people who deny the important role of peasants in the revolutionary struggle and who advocate only urban struggle. They pointed out that in Colombia, to carry out people's war, one must "rely on the peasants, establish rural base areas, encircle the cities from the countryside, and finally seize the cities."

	The members of the Mao Zedong Thought study groups emphasized: Whether the armed struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America can achieve victory depends on whether Mao Zedong Thought can be correctly applied.

    哥伦比亚革命者成立毛主席著作学习小组活学活用毛泽东思想
    以毛泽东思想为指导才能取得武装斗争的胜利
    开展人民战争必须依靠农民，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市
    新华社二十七日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚革命者最近成立了一些毛泽东思想学习小组。这些小组在学习毛主席著作的活动中，注意联系本国的革命斗争实际，通过学习，他们增强了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争的信心，认识到只有正确地运用毛泽东思想，才能取得革命武装斗争的胜利。
    这些毛泽东思想学习小组最近学习了毛主席的《关于目前党的政策中的几个重要问题》、《星星之火，可以燎原》等光辉著作，以及《毛主席语录》。
    学习小组的成员在学习无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的著作以后说，毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，“发展了马克思列宁主义，使全世界人民不为帝国主义的强大军事力量所吓倒，敢于进行反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争”。
    他们联系哥伦比亚的革命运动，批判了哥伦比亚某些人对敌人力量估计过高，不敢进行斗争的错误思想。他们指出，究竟是被敌人的力量所吓倒，还是敢于斗争、敢于胜利，这是两种思想、两条路线的斗争。他们引用了毛主席的教导：“我们有理由轻视它们，我们有把握、有信心战胜中国人民的一切内外敌人。”
    学习小组的成员还引用了毛主席的话：“但是在每一个局部上，在每一个具体斗争问题上（不论是军事的、政治的、经济的或思想的斗争），却又决不可轻视敌人，相反，应当重视敌人，集中全力作战，方能取得胜利。”学习小组的成员在学习了这一教导后说：“我们通过自己的经验，证明毛泽东思想完全正确。”
    学习小组在学习中还批判了某些人对革命的悲观情绪和对哥伦比亚反动派的幻想，指出哥伦比亚的革命形势大好：人民日益不能忍受美帝国主义及其走狗的剥削和压迫，人民逐渐地拒绝改良主义，越来越多的农民拒不参加反动统治阶级的选举丑剧，广大人民群众正在准备开展波澜壮阔的斗争。他们说：“哥伦比亚也是‘布满了干柴’，‘星星之火，可以燎原。’”
    学习小组的成员还批判了某些人否定农民在革命斗争中的重要作用、单纯搞城市斗争的错误思想。他们指出，在哥伦比亚开展人民战争，必须“依靠农民，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市”。
    毛主席著作学习小组的成员强调指出：亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的武装斗争是否能取得胜利，取决于能否正确地运用毛泽东思想。
