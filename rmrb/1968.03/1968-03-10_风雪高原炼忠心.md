Our troops have long been fighting in the snowy plateau, separated from Beijing by countless mountains and rivers. However, the hearts of the engineering troops are forever directed towards Beijing, forever towards the brightest red sun in our hearts. We think of it day and night, yearning for the day when we can stand by Chairman Mao's side and see him with our own eyes.

This most fortunate and unforgettable moment has finally arrived. On the afternoon of March 7, a red sun rose before our eyes. Our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao, waved his mighty hand, which guides the world revolution, and with a vigorous stride, came before us. Instantly, a wave of happiness spread through our bodies, and tears of joy welled up in our eyes. We shouted a thousand times, ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! "A ship needs a helmsman to navigate the seas, and revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought." For eighteen years, our company has followed your teachings, "To achieve national victory is only the first step in the long march," and "We must always maintain the spirit of hard struggle." We have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carrying your brilliant works, with simple baggage, crossing the battlefield filled with smoke and fire, and marching onto the snowy plateau. We continue the long march to carry the revolution to the end. From the snow-covered mountains to the vast grasslands, from the "Roof of the World" in Sichuan-Tibet to the boundless deserts. Wherever you point, we go. The more difficult the place, the more we settle down. Countless difficulties cannot scare us, these revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought! Countless obstacles cannot block our steadfast will to be loyal to you! We engineering troops, with our boundless loyalty to you, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have conquered treacherous mountains and rivers, overcome scorching heat and bitter cold; cut through rivers and split mountains; pitch a tent and plant seeds, pull up a tent and bloom flowers; built roads to the heavens and fortified iron walls, successfully completing one glorious task after another assigned by you.

Most beloved leader, Chairman Mao! The engineering troops will forever be loyal to you! For eighteen years, we have struggled hard to defend your revolutionary line; struggled hard to overcome the attacks of class enemies; struggled hard to build an iron wall against revisionism. Eighteen years of tent life in the snowy plateau have tempered our red hearts, making them stronger and purer! We regard reading your sacred books as our first need in life, and being infinitely loyal to you as the highest duty of a revolutionary soldier. We will forever follow your teachings, forever maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, endure hardships and labor for the people, take hardship as glory, and take labor as joy. To plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought across all of China and the world, we are determined to live and fight in the snowy plateau for a lifetime!

    风雪高原炼忠心
    工程兵学习毛主席著作先进集体、某部十连代表  王松海
    我们的部队，长期战斗在风雪高原，同北京隔着千山万水；但是，工程兵战士的心，永远向着北京，永远向着我们心中最红最红的红太阳。我们日日想，夜夜盼，盼望着有一天能够来到毛主席的身旁，能够亲眼见到毛主席。
    这个最最幸福、最最难忘的时刻终于来到了。三月七日下午，一轮红日在我们面前升起，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，频频挥动着他那指导世界革命的巨手，迈着矫健的步伐，来到了我们面前。顿时，幸福的暖流传遍全身，欢喜的热泪夺眶而出。我们千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。十八年来，我们连遵照您老人家“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步”和“务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的伟大教导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，带上您的光辉著作，背上简单的行装，跨过硝烟滚滚的战场，走上风雪迷漫的高原，继续进行着将革命进行到底的万里长征。从千里冰封的雪山，到一望无际的草地，从号称“世界屋脊”的川藏高原，到浩瀚无垠的戈壁滩。您老人家指向那里，我们就打到那里。那里最艰苦，我们就在那里安家。重重困难，吓不倒我们这些用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士！道道险关，挡不住我们忠于您老人家的坚强意志！我们工程兵战士，凭着对您老人家的无限忠心，靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，征服了险山恶水，战胜了酷热严寒；斩江江断，劈山山裂；扎一次帐篷播一次种，拔一次帐篷开一片花；修出了一条条通天路，筑成了一座座铁长城，胜利地完成了您老人家交给我们的一个又一个的光荣任务。
    最最敬爱的领袖毛主席！工程兵战士永远忠于您！十八年来，我们为捍卫您的革命路线而艰苦奋斗；为战胜阶级敌人的进攻而艰苦奋斗；为筑起反修防修的钢铁长城而艰苦奋斗。十八年风雪高原的帐篷生活，把我们忠于您老人家的一颗红心，磨炼得更坚强，更纯粹！我们把读您的宝书当成生活的第一需要，把无限忠于您当成革命战士的最高天职。我们要永远遵照您的教导，永远保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的优良作风，为人民吃大苦，耐大劳，以艰苦为荣，以劳动为乐。为了把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全中国、全世界，我们决心在风雪高原生活一辈子，战斗一辈子！
