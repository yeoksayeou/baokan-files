Under the brilliant guidance of the latest instructions from Chairman Mao, the revolutionary great unity in the coal capital of Fushun has rapidly developed under the leadership of coal miners. In just over a month, more than 90% of the units in the city have achieved revolutionary great unity. The two major revolutionary mass organizations in the city have also achieved revolutionary great unity and established the Fushun City Revolutionary Great Unity Command.

The revolutionary workers of the Fushun coal mines have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instruction: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." They have taken the lead in achieving revolutionary great unity. Under the leadership of the coal miners, the city quickly formed a high tide of revolutionary great unity. The broad masses of workers in the city, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, recalled the hardships and joys, deeply realizing that in the old society, the working class had common hatreds, and in the new society, the working class had common happiness and the common ideal of realizing communism. The broad masses of workers are like fruits on the same vine, with countless reasons to unite and no reason to split. Some workers who were previously in serious opposition followed Chairman Mao's instructions, abandoned all personal desires, and quickly united. Chairman Mao instructed: "As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary great unity should be achieved under revolutionary principles." Many factories and mines, with a revolutionary spirit of seizing the day, sought common ground while reserving differences, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. In mid-January, more than 90% of the units that first achieved revolutionary great unity in the city were composed of workers. Under the leadership of the working class, all sectors of the city also saw a wave of seriously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with the tide of revolutionary great unity surging higher and higher.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The broad revolutionary masses of Fushun, inspired by the People's Liberation Army, held numerous Mao Zedong Thought study classes. According to incomplete statistics, the city has established more than 3,000 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 180,000 people participating in the studies. In these classes, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, with boundless love for Chairman Mao and boundless admiration for Mao Zedong Thought, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Constantly Read Articles," fiercely fought against selfishness, and thoroughly defeated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, rapidly raising their class consciousness and strengthening their proletarian party spirit. Many comrades, who initially blamed each other, became models of self-criticism after the study. Some comrades, who had not spoken to each other for a year, became intimate and had heart-to-heart talks after the study class. The study classes closely linked with thoughts and actual situations, solidly solved problems, and quickly eliminated the opposition between the two factions, promoting revolutionary great unity.

Currently, under the help of the People's Liberation Army, the broad revolutionary masses of the city are further improving the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in every aspect, mobilizing the masses to fiercely attack bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity from the ideological level, and promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

　　煤都抚顺市革命大联合迅猛发展
    在煤矿工人带动下，认真落实毛主席最新指示，全市百分之九十以上的单位实现了革命大联合
    新华社沈阳十二日电  在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，煤都抚顺市的革命大联合在煤矿工人的带动下迅猛发展。仅一个多月的时间里，全市就有百分之九十以上的单位实现了革命大联合。全市两大派革命群众组织也实现了革命大联合，成立了抚顺市革命大联合指挥部。
    抚顺煤矿的广大革命职工认真地学习了毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示，带头实现了革命大联合。在煤矿工人的带动下，全市迅速形成了革命大联合的高潮。全市广大工人经过学习毛主席的最新指示，忆苦思甜，深刻认识到，在旧社会，工人阶级有共同的仇恨，在新社会，工人阶级有共同的幸福，有实现共产主义的共同理想。广大工人是一条藤上的瓜，有千条万条理由联合起来，没有半条理由分裂下去。一些过去严重对立的工人按照毛主席的指示，抛弃了一切私心杂念，迅速团结起来。毛主席指示：“只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”许多厂矿以只争朝夕的革命精神，求大同，存小异，迅速实现了革命的大联合。一月中旬，全市第一批实现革命大联合的单位中，百分之九十以上是工人队伍。在工人阶级一马当先的带动下，全市各行各业也出现了认真落实毛主席最新指示的热潮，革命大联合的洪流一浪高过一浪。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”抚顺广大无产阶级革命派，闻风而动，在人民解放军的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班。据不完全统计，全市先后办起了三千多个各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的人数达十八万多人。在学习班里，广大革命群众和革命干部怀着对毛主席无限热爱，对毛泽东思想无限崇拜的心情，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席最新指示和“老三篇”，狠斗“私”字；痛歼资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，迅速提高了阶级觉悟，增强了无产阶级党性。许多同志刚进学习班时，互相指责对方，经过学习，成了勇于做自我批评的模范。有的同志一年来见面不说话，到学习班后亲密地促膝谈心。学习班密切联系思想，密切联系实际，扎扎实实解决问题，迅速地消除了两大派群众中的对立情绪，促进了革命大联合。
    目前，全市广大革命群众在解放军的帮助下，正在进一步办好毛泽东思想学习班，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，发动群众狠狠围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，从思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合。
