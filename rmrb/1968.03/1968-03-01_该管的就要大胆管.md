Recently, our No. 6 blast furnace also experienced a wave of anarchism. For a time, labor discipline was lax, with some people arriving late and leaving early, not adhering to the eight-hour workday, and not taking shift changes seriously. When I saw this situation, I wanted to advise and stop it, but the words died in my throat. I thought: I once stood on the wrong side during the Cultural Revolution, said some wrong things, and did some wrong things. Although I am now elected as a member of the "three-in-one" small group, will they listen to me? I was afraid of offending people, afraid of making more mistakes, and a whole bunch of "fears" filled my head. I thought it would be better to turn a blind eye, to avoid trouble.

Later, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Communists must always be ready to uphold the truth, because any truth is in the interests of the people." I examined my thoughts and actions and realized that my liberal attitude towards anarchism was a loss of party spirit and a manifestation of anarchist thoughts. I struggled against my selfish thoughts, replacing "fear" with "dare" and "self" with "public." I straightened my back and bravely fought against anarchism.

From then on, I often had individual talks with those who did not observe labor discipline, reminding them of the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society; recalling the persecution of the capitalist reactionary line and the greatness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. I guided everyone to recognize that the current class enemies are using anarchist trends to corrupt the souls of our working class, interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We workers must not be fooled! I also actively promoted good deeds of consciously observing labor discipline and striving to improve production, launching a "people's war" against anarchism on the blast furnace.

The leaders dared to take on responsibilities, and those who should manage did so boldly. Everyone together opened fire on anarchism, and the situation quickly changed. Now our blast furnace has basically established a new revolutionary order, with everyone caring about the revolution and production. The revolution and production have shown a new face.

    该管的就要大胆管
    炼铁厂六号高炉炉长　赵永长
    前些日子，我们六号高炉也刮起了一阵无政府主义的阴风，一时劳动纪律松懈，有的人晚来早走，不坚持八小时工作制，交接班也不认真……。我一看这种情景，想劝告制止，可话到嘴边又咽了回去，心里想：自己在文化大革命中曾一度站错了队，说了一些错话，干了一些错事，虽然现在被选为“三结合”小组成员，要管人家会不会服呢？怕得罪人，怕再犯错误，一大堆
  “怕”字把我的脑袋塞得满满登登的，心想不如睁只眼闭只眼，省得落一身不是。
    后来，我反复学习了毛主席的教导：“共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理，因为任何真理都是符合于人民利益的”，对照自己的思想和行为，认识到自己用自由主义态度对待无政府主义，这是丧失党性，也是无政府主义思想的表现。我狠斗了自己的私心杂念，把“怕”字换成了“敢”字，把“私”字换成了“公”字，挺起腰杆子，勇敢地向无政府主义作斗争。
    从此以后，我常找个别不遵守劳动纪律的人进行谈心，和他们一起忆旧社会的苦，看新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的迫害，看毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的英明伟大。引导大家认识到，当前阶级敌人利用无政府主义思潮，来腐蚀我们工人阶级的灵魂，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，我们工人阶级千万不能上当！我还大力宣传自觉遵守劳动纪律，努力搞好生产的好人好事，在高炉上掀起了一场围剿无政府主义的“人民战争”。
    领导敢于担担子，该管的就大胆管，大家一起向无政府主义开火，情况很快就变了。现在我们高炉基本上建立起了革命的新秩序，人人都关心革命和生产，革命和生产出现了崭新的面貌。
