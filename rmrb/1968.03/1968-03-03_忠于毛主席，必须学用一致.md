Many units of the People's Liberation Army have successively held conferences of activists who study Chairman Mao's works. These conferences have collectively reflected the achievements and experiences of our military's broad ranks of soldiers and officers in actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought over the past year and more in the struggle between the two lines. The entire army has produced a large number of advanced individuals and collectives who continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, the broad ranks of soldiers and officers have raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, strengthened their ideological revolutionization, and deepened their profound proletarian feelings of love for Chairman Mao. The mass movement of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in our military, in accordance with the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, has adapted to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and has reached a new stage.

For our great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we must harbor a "loyalty" in our hearts and grasp the "application" firmly. This is the most fundamental experience of the countless activists who study Chairman Mao's works, and it is also the key issue for our military to carry out the great mass movement of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought more broadly and deeply, and to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao pointed out: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." Loyalty to our great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, is loyalty to the proletarian revolutionary cause. This is the prerequisite for studying Mao Zedong Thought well. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, through various forms of activities, we have vigorously cultivated and strengthened our proletarian feelings of unbounded loyalty to Chairman Mao, which has powerfully promoted the tide of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. We must continue to grasp this firmly and not let it go.

It should be pointed out that actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and seriously executing Chairman Mao's instructions, is the fundamental issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Grasping attitude must firmly grasp the "application." We must turn our class feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line into the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, and work hard on the "application."

Loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought must be manifested through application. "Regarding the theory of Marxism, one must be able to master it and apply it; the purpose of mastery is entirely for application." Loyalty to Chairman Mao is to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary theory, line, policies, and strategies, and to carry out Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. This requires us to work hard in practice.

Loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought must be verified through application. "Social practice and its effects are the criteria for examining subjective wishes or motives." A revolutionary soldier who is truly loyal to Chairman Mao must be good at learning, executing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. If one has shortcomings and errors, one must use Mao Zedong Thought to strive to overcome and correct them. Those who do not practice what they preach, who are Marxist-Leninists towards others but libertarians towards themselves, cannot be said to be truly loyal to Chairman Mao.

Loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought must be continuously improved through application. "Practice, cognition, more practice, more cognition—this process of the spiral advancement of cognition is endless. The content of each cycle of practice and cognition is on a higher level than the last." Only by repeatedly learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in revolutionary struggles can one increasingly deeply understand Chairman Mao's wisdom, greatness, and the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. Only by truly understanding and mastering Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in revolutionary practice, raising one's proletarian consciousness, and transforming one's worldview, can one firmly establish proletarian feelings of unbounded loyalty to Chairman Mao. Otherwise, when the storm comes, one will consciously or unconsciously deviate from the proletarian revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao.

In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our military is shouldering more and heavier tasks than ever before, and the Party and the people have higher expectations of us. We must firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on guiding real-class struggles, and put them into action. We must execute what we understand and also execute what we do not yet fully understand, understanding it through execution, so that Chairman Mao's instructions are fully implemented at all levels.

The most fundamental aspect of grasping the "application" is to use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and repudiate revisionism. The bourgeois "self" is the great enemy of the proletarian "loyalty." The more "self" there is, the less "loyalty" there is. To be loyal to Chairman Mao, one must criticize and repudiate the "self." To be unboundedly loyal to Chairman Mao, one must thoroughly criticize and repudiate the "self." In the current struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, only by resolutely cutting out the poisonous tumor of "self," eliminating the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist thoughts, and removing various interferences that hinder us from implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, can we closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and truly be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If there is only the enthusiasm of the masses without a strong leadership cadre to properly organize the enthusiasm of the masses, then the enthusiasm of the masses will neither be sustained nor will it move in the correct direction and reach a higher level."

To raise the mass movement of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in our military to a higher level to adapt to the new situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must strengthen leadership. Towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, cadres at all levels must, in harboring a "loyalty" and grasping the "application," set an example by personally practicing it, guiding the broad ranks of soldiers and officers to continuously strengthen their proletarian feelings of unbounded love, faith, admiration, and loyalty towards the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. We must resolutely implement the set of principles proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao: "Study with problems in mind, actively learn and apply, combine learning with application, learn first what is urgently needed, see immediate results, and work hard on the 'application.'" We must repeatedly propagate and implement these principles, further establish the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, and make the great mass movement of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought both vigorous and solid.

### 忠于毛主席，必须学用一致

    忠于毛主席，必须学用一致
    全军许多单位陆续召开了学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。大会集中地反映了一年多来，我军广大指战员在两条路线斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想的新成就，新经验。全军涌现出了大批无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的先进人物和先进集体。广大指战员通过斗私，批修，提高了对两条路线斗争的觉悟，加强了思想革命化，大大地加深了热爱毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情。我军活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，按照林彪副主席的指示，适应无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，提高到了一个新的阶段。
    对我们无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，心怀一个“忠”字，狠抓一个“用”字，是千千万万学习毛主席著作积极分子的最基本的经验，也是我军更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，全面落实毛主席最新指示的关键问题。
    林彪副主席指出：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”忠于我们无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席，就是忠于无产阶级革命事业，这是学好毛泽东思想的前提。无产阶级文化大革命运动开展以来，我们通过各种形式的活动，大力培养和加强对毛主席无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，有力地推动了活学活用毛泽东思想的热潮。我们必须继续狠抓下去，抓住不放。
    应当指出，活学活用毛主席的著作，认真执行毛主席的指示，这是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的根本态度问题。抓态度，必须紧紧抓住一个“用”字，必须把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的阶级感情，落实到活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，要通过用来体现。“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”忠于毛主席，就是要用毛泽东思想统帅一切，把毛主席的革命理论、路线、方针、政策切实贯彻下去，把毛主席的伟大战略部署付诸实现。这就必须扎扎实实地在斗争中去用。
    忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，要通过用来检验。“社会实践及其效果是检验主观愿望或动机的标准。”一个革命战士真正忠于毛主席，就要善于学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。自己有了缺点错误，就要用毛泽东思想去努力克服和纠正。言行不一，对人马列主义，对自己自由主义，都不能说真正忠于毛主席。
    忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，要通过用来不断提高。
  “实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。”只有在革命斗争的实践中反复学习、反复运用毛泽东思想，才能越来越深刻地认识毛主席的英明、伟大和毛泽东思想的巨大威力。只有在革命实践中真正理解和掌握毛主席的革命路线，提高自己的无产阶级觉悟，改造世界观，才能牢固地建立起无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情。否则，风浪一来，就会自觉不自觉地离开毛主席指引的无产阶级革命轨道。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，我军担负着比过去更多更繁重的任务，党和人民群众对我们提出了更高的要求。我们一定要坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，把毛主席指导现实阶级斗争的一系列最新指示切实贯彻到自己的行动中去，理解的执行，暂时不完全理解的也执行，在执行中去理解，使毛主席的指示条条落实，层层落实，全面落实。
    狠抓一个“用”字，最根本的，是要用毛泽东思想斗私，批修。资产阶级“私”字，是无产阶级“忠”字的大敌。
  “私”字多一分，“忠”字就少一分。要忠于毛主席，就必须斗私。要无限地忠于毛主席，就要彻底地斗私。在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，只有舍得彻底割掉“私”字的毒瘤，肃清资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思想的影响，排除妨碍我们贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的种种干扰，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，真正做到忠于伟大领袖毛主席。
    毛主席教导我们：“如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”
    要使我军活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，适应夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的新形势，提到更高级的程度，就必须加强领导。对毛主席，对毛泽东思想，各级领导干部要在心怀一个“忠”字、狠抓一个“用”字上，身体力行做好样子，引导广大指战员不断增强对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情。要坚决贯彻林彪副主席提出的“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”这一整套方针原则，反复宣传，反复落实，进一步树立毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风，使活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，开展得轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。（三月三日）
