Thai people's armed forces grow stronger in battle. The people's armed forces in Chiang Rai Province of northern Thailand, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, are becoming increasingly powerful and have achieved continuous victories.

The radio station reported that, according to incomplete statistics, from last May to the present, the people's armed forces in Chiang Rai Province have engaged in 33 battles with the enemy, killing 86 enemy personnel, shooting down one enemy helicopter, and seizing a batch of weapons.

The radio station said that the people's armed forces in Chiang Rai Province often enter enemy-held villages to conduct propaganda and mobilize and organize the masses, receiving a warm welcome from the people.

According to another broadcast by the same radio station, on March 21, the people's armed forces in Kuy Buri County, Phetchabun Province, central Thailand, once again bravely and cleverly ambushed the enemy, killing and wounding a group of reactionaries from the so-called "development teams" sent by the American-Thanon group to suppress the people. The radio station said that a "defense team" sent by the Thanom-Paphon traitorous group to rescue them also suffered a head-on attack from the people's armed forces.

The radio station said that the people's armed forces in Kuy Buri had previously ambushed the enemy three times last year, killing and wounding a number of enemy personnel, including two colonel-level police officers.
