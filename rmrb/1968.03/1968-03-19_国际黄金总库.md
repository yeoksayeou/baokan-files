The "International Gold Reserve" (hereinafter referred to as the "Gold Reserve") was established in 1960 following a large-scale capitalistic world gold-buying frenzy. At that time, the position of the dollar was severely impacted. The United States saw that it could no longer handle the situation alone and thus rallied a group of Western European countries to form the "Gold Reserve." The aim was to use these countries' gold reserves to help it cope with the gold-buying frenzy and stabilize the dollar's position. These countries, considering their common interest in preventing the collapse of the capitalist monetary system, accepted the U.S. proposal.

The so-called "Gold Reserve" is not a real "vault" but refers to the supply of gold by member countries through the Bank of England to the London gold market to stabilize the gold price at the U.S. official rate of $35 per ounce. According to the agreement, more than half of the supplied gold is to be provided by the United States, with the remaining portion to be shared by the Western European member countries in proportion.

The seven Western European countries that initially participated in the "Gold Reserve" were: the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Later, France, considering its own interests, was unwilling to continue using gold to support the dollar's privileged position and ceased participating in the "Gold Reserve" activities starting in June 1967. Moreover, in the recent unprecedented large-scale gold-buying frenzy in the Western world, France actually played a role in fanning the flames from behind, launching an attack on the dollar to force the United States to abandon the dollar's privileged position.

The March 16-17 meeting of the "Gold Reserve" member countries in Washington decided that in the future, gold would no longer be supplied to the London gold market and other so-called "free gold markets." This effectively marked the collapse of the "Gold Reserve," which was established to defend the dollar's position, and also meant allowing the dollar to "freely" devalue.

### “国际黄金总库”

　　“国际黄金总库”
    “国际黄金总库”（简称“黄金总库”）成立于一九六○年一次资本主义世界大规模抢购黄金风潮之后。当时美元地位受到很大冲击。美国眼看依靠自己单独的力量已经无法应付，于是拉拢一批西欧国家组织“黄金总库”，目的是利用这些国家的黄金储备来帮它应付抢购黄金风潮，稳定美元地位；而这些国家当时出于不愿资本主义货币体系垮台的共同利害考虑，也就接受了美国的这个要求。
    所谓“黄金总库”并不是一个真正的“金库”，而是指的由各成员国通过英格兰银行向伦敦黄金市场供应黄金，以便使金价稳定在美国官方规定的每盎司三十五美元的水平；按照协议，所供应的黄金中，一半以上由美国承担，其余部分由西欧成员国按比例分担。
    最初参加“黄金总库”的七个西欧国家是：英国、法国、西德、意大利、比利时、瑞士和荷兰。后来，法国从本身的利益出发，不愿继续用黄金支持美元的特权地位，从一九六七年六月起停止参加“黄金总库”的活动；不仅如此，在西方世界最近空前规模的抢购黄金风潮中，法国实际上还在背后推波助澜，向美元发动进攻，力图迫使美国放弃美元的特权地位。
    三月十六日—十七日在华盛顿举行的“黄金总库”成员国会议决定，今后将不再向伦敦黄金市场和其它的所谓黄金“自由市场”供应黄金，这就实际上宣告了这个为保卫美元地位服务的“黄金总库”的垮台，同时也意味着听任美元“自由”贬值。
