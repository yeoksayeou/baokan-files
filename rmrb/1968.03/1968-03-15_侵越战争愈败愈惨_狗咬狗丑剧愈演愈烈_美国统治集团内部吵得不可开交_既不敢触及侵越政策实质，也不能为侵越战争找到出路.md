The Vietnam War becomes more disastrous; infighting among U.S. ruling class intensifies

The U.S. imperialists suffer heavier defeats on the battlefield in South Vietnam, and their ruling class engages in more intense internal squabbles. Recently, the U.S. aggressors were severely defeated on the battlefield in South Vietnam, and within the U.S., the ruling class is embroiled in fierce arguments over the unprecedented failures and lack of solutions in the war of aggression.

On March 11 and 12, during a meeting of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, some senators questioned Secretary of State Dean Rusk about the Johnson administration's planned new "escalation" of the war. Many senators expressed concern about the potential consequences of further escalation. Democratic Senator Albert Gore said that further escalation would "lead us to disaster."

During his two-day, 16-hour testimony, Rusk was evasive, attempting to conceal the U.S. imperialists' plans for war escalation. He claimed that the situation was being "studied from beginning to end" and that no decision had been made. At the same time, he vigorously defended the U.S. policy of aggression in Vietnam, asserting that the U.S. had certain "world police" responsibilities in South Vietnam.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman William Fulbright noted with concern that U.S. policy toward Vietnam had already produced and would continue to produce disastrous consequences both domestically and internationally. He accused the Johnson administration of concealing the truth about the failures in the Vietnam War, stating that the battlefield situation contradicted the U.S. government's accounts of the war. He admitted that after news of the U.S. government's plans to significantly escalate the war in Vietnam, domestic criticism of the policy had increased. Democratic Senator Albert Gore criticized Johnson, saying that the U.S. decision to use force in South Vietnam to achieve what could not be obtained through other means was a "serious mistake."

Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee questioned Rusk, Senator Wayne Morse revealed a secret investigative report on the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, exposing the U.S. government's fabrication of the pretext for bombing North Vietnam. The report indicated that the so-called Gulf of Tonkin incident was entirely fabricated by the U.S. as a pretext for bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The report admitted that the alleged attack on U.S. destroyers by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin "may never have happened" and was a pretext manufactured by the U.S. to justify bombing North Vietnam. Morse acknowledged in the committee that during the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the U.S. government and senators "used deceptive language to cover up our provocations." The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's investigation and disclosure of the results of its investigation showed that infighting within the U.S. ruling class over the Vietnam War had reached an unprecedented level of intensity.

According to Western news agencies, after two days of questioning, Rusk appeared exhausted. The United Press International reported: "Many senators expressed deep doubts about whether the U.S. could achieve its goals in Southeast Asia."

While the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was engaged in heated debates, a fierce argument over Vietnam policy also erupted in the House of Representatives, with many representatives also calling for a reassessment of U.S. basic policy toward Southeast Asia.

However, whether in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or the House of Representatives, the leaders of the U.S. ruling class insisted on continuing the aggression in Vietnam. They only demanded that the Johnson administration consult with Congress before implementing more extreme escalation. As Fulbright put it, such consultations were to make the U.S. government's actions in Vietnam "wiser," rather than recklessly pushing ahead and risking even greater failure. The infighting within the U.S. ruling class showed that, regardless of how fiercely they attacked each other or how harsh their language, they neither dared to challenge the substance of U.S. Vietnam policy nor could they provide a way out for U.S. Vietnam policy. Instead, as the Vietnam War became more disastrous, the infighting would only intensify.

　　侵越战争愈败愈惨  狗咬狗丑剧愈演愈烈
　　美国统治集团内部吵得不可开交
　　既不敢触及侵越政策实质，也不能为侵越战争找到出路
    新华社十三日讯　华盛顿消息：美帝国主义在南越战场上每遭到一次更惨重的失败，它的统治集团内部就爆发一次更激烈的争吵。最近，美国侵略者在越南南方战场上被打得人仰马翻，狼狈不堪，而在美国国内，统治集团内部也为侵略战争的空前惨败和毫无出路吵得不可开交。
    三月十一日和十二日，在美国参议院外交委员会里，一些参议员就约翰逊政府正在酝酿的战争新“升级”向国务卿腊斯克提出质问，许多参议员对进一步“升级”将会招致的后果表示不安，民主党参议员戈尔说：进一步“升级”“势将把我们导向灾难”。
    腊斯克在为期两天、长达十六小时的作证中，一方面含糊其词，力图掩盖美帝国主义的战争“升级”计划，说什么“整个情况正在从头至尾进行研究”，这个问题“尚未作出决定”。同时，他又极力为美帝侵越政策辩解，叫嚷美国在南越承担着“世界警察任务”的“某些方面”。
    参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特在质询中不安地指出，美国对越南的政策“在国内外已经产生了而且还将产生完全是灾难性的影响”。他指责约翰逊政府掩盖侵越战争失败的真相说，战场上的实况同美国政府关于战况的叙述有“显著的矛盾”。他承认，在传出了美国政府正策划使侵越战争大大“升级”的消息后，美国国内批评侵越政策的人增多了。民主党参议员戈尔指责约翰逊说，美国决定在南越“使用武力去取得我们用其他手段不能取得的东西”，这是犯了一个“重大的错误”。
    在参议院外交委员会对腊斯克进行质询之前，参议员莫尔斯透露了这个委员会关于一九六四年八月“东京湾事件”的一份绝密的调查研究报告，把美国政府发动对越南北方的强盗空袭的老底都翻出来。这份调查报告表明，所谓“东京湾事件”完全是美国为了轰炸越南民主共和国而捏造的一个借口。报告供认，在“东京湾”的美国两艘驱逐舰所谓受到越南民主共和国鱼雷艇袭击事件，“可能根本没有发生”，而是美国为了“决定轰炸北越”一手制造的借口。莫尔斯在外交委员会承认，在“东京湾事件”中，美国政府和参议员们“以骗人的话来掩盖我们的挑衅”。参议院外交委员会现在来“调查”所谓“东京湾事件”，并把它的调查结果加以透露，正是说明了在美国统治集团内部，关于侵越战争的狗咬狗的争吵已经达到空前的激烈程度。
    据西方通讯社报道，在经过两天的质询后，腊斯克显得疲惫不堪。美国合众国际社说：“许多参议员对美国能否达到它在东南亚的目标深表怀疑”。
    在参议院外交委员会进行唇枪舌剑争吵的同时，在众议院里也爆发了一场关于侵越政策的激烈辩论，许多众议员也要求重新研究美国对东南亚的基本政策。
    但是，不管是在参议院外交委员会还是众议院，美国统治集团的头目们都坚持美国继续侵略越南，他们只是要求约翰逊政府在实行更疯狂的升级之前，要同国会进行所谓“磋商”。用富布赖特的话说，这种磋商是为了要使美国政府在侵越中做得“明智”点，而不要不顾一切地挺而走险，结果招致更惨的失败。美国统治集团内部的争吵表明，不管他们互相攻讦多么激烈，用语多么刻薄，他们都既不敢触及美国侵越政策的实质，也不能为美国侵越政策提供出路，而只会是随着侵越战争的愈败愈惨，狗咬狗的争吵愈演愈烈。
