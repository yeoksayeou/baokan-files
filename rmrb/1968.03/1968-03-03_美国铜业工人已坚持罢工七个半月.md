A strike involving 60,000 workers in the U.S. copper industry, which began on July 15 last year, has now lasted seven and a half months. This is the longest strike in U.S. history involving all aspects of an industry. It has halted production at 60 copper mines and smelters in 23 states, bringing U.S. copper production to a virtual standstill and seriously affecting the production of armaments for the Vietnam War.

The 60,000 miners and smelters went on strike to protest their low wages and poor working conditions.

    美国铜业工人已坚持罢工七个半月
    有六万工人参加的美国铜业工人大罢工从去年七月十五日开始，到现在已经坚持了七个半月。这是美国历史上涉及一个工业部门各个环节的一次持续最久的大罢工。它使美国二十三个州的六十个铜业厂矿停止了生产，使美国铜的生产几乎全部陷于瘫痪，严重影响了侵越战争的军火生产。
    六万采铜和炼铜工人采取罢工行动是为了抗议他们的工资低和劳动条件恶劣。
