	Night Raid on Bau Bang
	— A Record of the Vietnamese Southern People's Liberation Armed Forces Attacking the American Puppet Military Stronghold Bau Bang

	Not long ago, a unit of the Vietnamese Southern People's Liberation Armed Forces swiftly attacked the American puppet military stronghold Bau Bang near Saigon, defeating the enemy thoroughly. The local people were overjoyed and celebrated this glorious victory enthusiastically.

	Bau Bang is located 34 kilometers northwest of Saigon, serving as a crucial military junction for Highway 10 and Highway 8. The command center of the puppet military district is stationed here, with a large number of American and puppet troops, as well as Filipino mercenaries, garrisoned in the area. It is also a den for many treacherous and wicked traitors.

	On January 7, a unit of the Liberation Army swiftly approached Bau Bang under the cover of darkness. Soon, the puppet military and political organs in Bau Bang came within the range of the Liberation Army's light and heavy weapons. At around 1 a.m., after a brief and sharp charge signal, various units of the Liberation Army bravely crossed the enemy's barbed wire and minefields, swiftly capturing the enemy's outer fortifications.

	The Liberation Army's artillery units unleashed a fierce barrage, accurately hitting all predetermined targets. The enemy's ammunition depot also exploded, causing a deafening roar and a sky-high blaze.

	Under the cover of the artillery units, the Liberation Army's infantry units penetrated deep into Bau Bang like sharp swords. The enemy's military and political organs fell into chaos. After a brief, disoriented resistance, most of the enemy soldiers threw down their weapons and either fled or surrendered. A company from the puppet 49th Regiment saw the Liberation Army and, in fear, dropped their weapons and fled. A heavy machine gun crew, along with all their equipment, surrendered to the Liberation Army. A deputy governor and a police chief of the puppet government were so terrified that they tore off their insignia and hastily surrendered.

	Just ten minutes after the battle began, the Liberation Army's assault teams hoisted the gold-starred red and blue flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on the rooftops of the puppet military and political organs, and the flag of victory fluttered in the wind.

	The Liberation Army, while pursuing the traitorous criminals, also opened the enemy's prison doors, rescuing the detained civilians.

	The battle progressed smoothly according to plan. The Liberation Army units coordinated closely and jointly annihilated several pockets of stubborn enemy resistance. Subsequently, they launched a powerful political offensive. Loudspeakers were set up on the battlefield, loudly calling on the puppet soldiers to lay down their arms and redeem their sins.

	After one hour, the Liberation Army had completely taken control of Bau Bang and the command center of the puppet military district at Thua Duc.

	The people of Bau Bang poured into the streets, warmly welcoming the Liberation Army soldiers. They offered tea and fruits, expressing their long-awaited joy to see their kin. Everywhere, there was a touching scene of military-civilian unity. The Liberation Army soldiers saw an old woman's house on fire and rushed to rescue her. The old woman stopped them, saying, "Children, quickly go and annihilate those damned enemies, my house is not important." The people also led the Liberation Army in capturing the hidden traitors and puppet military officers, one by one. The civilian workers joyfully cleaned up the battlefield and counted the spoils of war.

	This battle achieved a brilliant victory, annihilating over 1,100 enemy soldiers and completely destroying the important military stronghold and den of the American puppet group in Bau Bang.

　　夜袭保寨市
　　——记越南南方人民解放武装力量袭击美伪军事要地保寨市
    不久前，越南南方人民解放武装力量的一支部队，神速袭击西贡附近的美伪军事要地保寨市，打得敌人落花流水。当地的人民群众欢欣鼓舞，热烈庆祝这一辉煌胜利。
    保寨市位于西贡西北三十四公里处，是十号公路和八号公路相连接的军事要地。伪军军事小区的指挥机构设在这里，大批美伪军和菲律宾帮凶军在这里驻扎。这里也是许多血债累累的越奸恶棍盘踞的巢穴。
    一月七日，一支解放军队伍在漆黑的深夜，迅速地向保寨市逼近。不多久，设在保寨市的伪军政机关，都陷入解放军轻重武器的射程之内。凌晨一时许，在一阵短促的响亮的冲锋号声过后，各路解放军队伍奋勇地跃过敌人的铁丝网，越过布雷区，迅速地攻占了敌人的外围碉堡。
    解放军的炮兵部队以猛烈的炮火，准确地命中了各个预定的目标。敌人的弹药库也中弹爆炸，响声震耳，烈焰冲天。
    在炮兵部队的有力掩护下，解放军各步兵部队象一把把利剑，向保寨市的纵深穿插。敌人的军政机关，陷入了一片混乱之中。大部分敌人在晕头转向地抵抗一阵之后，就扔掉枪支弹药，逃命的逃命，投降的投降。伪军四十九团所属的一个连的士兵，刚看见解放军的影子，就吓得扔掉武器没命地逃跑；一个重机枪组带着全部装备，乖乖地钻出工事向解放军缴械投降。伪政权的一个副省长和一个警察局长，吓得面如土色，撕掉了肩章，慌忙地举手投降……。
    在战斗打响后的十分钟，解放军的突击队就把越南南方民族解放阵线的金星红蓝旗，插到伪军政机关的屋顶上，胜利的旗帜迎风飘扬。
    解放军一面追捕越奸恶棍，一面打开敌人的牢门，营救被监禁的人民群众。
    战斗按计划胜利进展。解放军各单位密切配合，协同作战，顺利歼灭了几股顽抗的敌人。接着，又发起强大的政治攻势。阵地上架起扩音喇叭，大声向敌人喊话，号召伪军官兵放下武器，将功赎罪。
    一小时后，解放军完全控制了保寨市和厚义伪军事小区的指挥机构。
    保寨市的人民群众涌上街头，热烈欢迎解放军战士，他们端茶送果，慰劳盼望已久的亲人。到处是一片军民一家的动人景象。解放军战士们看见一位老大娘的房子在燃烧，急忙冲过去抢救。那位老大娘却拦住说：“孩子，快去把那些该死的敌人消灭干净，我的房子不要紧。”群众还纷纷带领解放军把那些隐藏起来的恶棍和伪军军官，一个个地揪出来。民工们则欢欣鼓舞地打扫战场，清点战利品。
    这次战斗取得辉煌的战果，歼敌一千一百多名，彻底摧毁了美伪集团在保寨市的重要军事据点和巢穴。
