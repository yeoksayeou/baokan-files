Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the two revolutionary mass organizations in Jinzhou City have achieved revolutionary unity. In early February, the Jinzhou City Revolutionary Unity Committee was established. The formation of the Jinzhou City Revolutionary Unity Committee has strongly promoted revolutionary unity at the grassroots level; grassroots revolutionary unity, in turn, has consolidated the revolutionary unity of the entire city, forming a high tide of revolutionary unity from top to bottom and bottom to top.

In recent days, the entire city of Jinzhou has been in a festive atmosphere. Red flags are flying everywhere, drums are beating, and joyous revolutionary masses are constantly arriving to report their successes. By March 1st, more than 540 units, large and small, had come to the Jinzhou Garrison to report their achievements in implementing revolutionary unity.

During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Jinzhou City have waged a resolute struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. They have fiercely exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by China's Khrushchev and his local agents, who attempted to restore capitalism, making significant contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, the revolutionary masses of Jinzhou City were previously divided into two major factions, with serious antagonistic sentiments. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, the People's Liberation Army units stationed in Jinzhou, along with the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, helped the two revolutionary mass organizations hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The two factions of revolutionary masses, with the slogan "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism and Criticize and Repudiate the Self," summarized and reviewed the experiences and lessons of the previous stage of the movement. Chairman Mao's teachings on "Within the proletarian class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletarian class to split into two irreconcilable factions" illuminated the hearts of the revolutionary masses. Through class education activities such as recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, they thoroughly criticized and repudiated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening their proletarian party spirit. They said, the more the class enemies oppose our implementation of revolutionary unity, the more we must implement revolutionary unity.

Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, heart-to-heart talks were conducted, actively opening up and sharing their thoughts, eliminating misunderstandings and suspicions, and continuously clearing away bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Finally, the two revolutionary mass organizations successfully achieved revolutionary unity.

    广大革命派认真落实毛主席最新指示
    锦州市形成革命大联合高潮
    据新华社沈阳三日电　在毛主席最新指示的指引下，锦州市两大革命群众组织实现了革命大联合，二月上旬成立了锦州市革命大联合委员会。锦州市革命大联合委员会的成立，有力地推动了基层的革命大联合；基层的革命大联合又巩固了全市的革命大联合，形成了一个以上带下，以下促上的革命大联合的高潮。
    连日来，锦州全城一片欢腾。到处红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，报喜的革命群众队伍络绎不绝。到三月一日，实现革命大联合以后来到锦州警备区报喜的大小单位已有五百四十多个。
    锦州市无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，向党内一小撮走资派展开了坚决的斗争。他们狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区代理人推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，对无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大贡献。由于党内一小撮走资派的挑动和资产阶级反动路线的影响，锦州市革命群众前一时期分成两大派，对立情绪比较严重。毛主席的最新指示下达后，人民解放军驻锦州部队毛泽东思想宣传队帮助两派革命群众组织开办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。两派革命群众以“斗私，批修”为纲，总结检查了前段运动中的经验教训。毛主席关于“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的教导，照亮了革命群众的心，他们通过忆苦思甜等阶级教育活动，狠挖私心，狠斗资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强了无产阶级党性。他们说，阶级敌人越是反对我们实行革命大联合，我们越是要实行革命大联合。
    在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，开展了谈心活动，互相主动交心，亮“底”，消除隔阂，消除戒心，双方不断地清除资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，终于胜利地实现了两大革命群众组织的革命大联合。
