The Naga, Mizo, and other ethnic armed groups have resolved to strengthen cooperation and jointly fight the enemy, launching armed struggles to resist the oppression of the Indian reactionary forces. The anxious Indian reactionary government is colluding with the Burmese reactionary government, attempting to jointly extinguish the flames of these ethnic armed struggles.

According to Indian bourgeois newspapers, in the northeastern border regions of India, several ethnic armed groups are making new preparations for large-scale guerrilla activities. These regions include the Naga Hills, Mizo Hills, and the centrally administered territory of Manipur.

It is revealed that the Naga and Mizo peoples have strengthened their ties through Manipur. A large number of Mizo people have moved to the Churachandpur district of Manipur. They have closely contacted the local Kukis. Some armed units of the Naga people have coordinated their actions, reorganized their structures, and are expanding their forces.

Since the beginning of this year, these ethnic armed groups have repeatedly launched attacks, striking a powerful blow to the Indian reactionary forces. In an ambush early this year, the Mizo people killed 26 Indian soldiers and wounded many others.

In recent years, the Indian reactionary government has colluded with the Burmese reactionary government to conspire against these ethnic armed groups. The Indian newspaper "The Statesman" once revealed that the reactionary authorities of India and Burma reached an agreement in early 1966 to conduct joint patrols along the Indo-Burma border. When the former Indian Foreign Minister Chagla visited Burma in 1967, he again secretly discussed with the Burmese reactionary government further reactionary measures for joint suppression. In November 1967, the reactionary governments of India and Burma held secret talks in New Delhi on this issue.

The head of the Burmese reactionary government, Ne Win, is scheduled to visit India on March 15. It is revealed that he will further discuss with the Indian reactionary government the issue of jointly suppressing the ethnic armed groups in the border regions of the two countries.

The Indian reactionary forces are creating public opinion for this conspiracy. Indian reactionary government officials and bourgeois newspapers have been continuously propagating that "Naga people living in India have entered Burma in batches," "the headquarters of the Naga armed forces is in Burma," and so on.

The Indian reactionary forces also attempt to divide the Naga, Mizo, and other ethnic groups, buying off a portion of the ethnic traitors, providing them with weapons, and inciting them to kill their own people who do not wish to submit to the reactionary rule of India.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "National struggles, after all, are a class struggle issue." The armed struggles of the Naga, Mizo, and other ethnic groups are forced by the Indian reactionary forces, and are the inevitable result of the brutal class oppression of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie. Whether the Indian reactionary forces collude with the Burmese reactionary forces to suppress or take other reactionary measures, they cannot stop these ethnic groups, who have already risen up, from bravely fighting to maintain their right to exist.

### 那加、米佐等民族武装决心加强合作共同对敌　开展武装斗争反抗印度反动派压迫

　　那加、米佐等民族武装决心加强合作共同对敌
　　开展武装斗争反抗印度反动派压迫
    新华社十一日讯　新德里消息：那加、米佐、库基等民族最近加强合作，准备开展大规模的武装斗争，反抗印度反动派的压迫。惶恐不安的印度反动政府正在勾结缅甸反动政府，妄想联合扑灭这些民族武装斗争的火焰。
    据印度资产阶级报纸透露，在印度东北边境地区，一些民族武装正在为开展大规模游击活动进行新的准备工作。这些地区包括那加山区、米佐山区和中央直属领地曼尼普尔。
    据透露，那加族和米佐族人民通过曼尼普尔加强了联系。大批米佐族人已经迁居到曼尼普尔的恰拉昌德普尔区。他们和当地的库基族人密切接触。那加族的一些武装部队已经协调行动，改组机构，并且正在发展自己的队伍。
    今年以来，这些民族武装一再出击，有力地打击印度反动派。米佐族在年初的一次伏击中，一举打死印军士兵二十六名，打伤多名。
    印度反动政府近年来同缅甸反动政府相勾结，密谋镇压这些民族武装。印度《政治家报》曾经透露，印缅反动当局在一九六六年初达成了在印缅边境联合巡逻的协议。印度前外交部长查格拉一九六七年到缅甸活动时，又同缅甸反动政府密商了双方在联合镇压上进一步勾结的反动措施。一九六七年十一月间，印缅反动政府又在新德里就这一问题举行密谈。
    缅甸反动政府头子奈温订于三月十五日去印度活动。据透露，他将同印度反动政府进一步商谈联合镇压两国边境地区的民族武装问题。
    印度反动派正在为采取这一阴谋行动制造舆论。印度反动政府官员和资产阶级报刊接连大肆宣传，“住在印度的那加族人分批进入缅甸”，“那加族武装的总部设在缅甸”，等等。
    印度反动派还妄图分裂那加、米佐等民族，收买一部分民族败类，向他们提供武器，煽动他们去残杀不愿屈服于印度反动统治的本族人民。
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”那加、米佐等民族开展武装斗争是印度反动派逼出来的，是印度大地主大资产阶级残暴的阶级压迫的必然结果。无论印度反动派勾结缅甸反动派进行镇压还是采取其它反动措施，都不能阻止这些已经揭竿而起的民族为维护他们生存的权利而勇敢地战斗。
