On the first anniversary of the issuance of the brilliant "March 7" directive by our great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary teachers and students of the First Middle School in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, along with the People's Liberation Army soldiers executing military training tasks, filled with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty towards Chairman Mao, towards the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, reviewed the past year's battle journey. They carried out extensive celebrations, study sessions, propaganda, and implementation activities for Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive. Everyone further recognized that Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive is a great historical document that has pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in primary, secondary, and higher education to a new stage. Over the past year, the revolutionary teachers and students of the First Middle School in Shijiazhuang City have advanced along the course opened by Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, achieving significant successes in military and political training, resuming classes and making revolution, and educational reform.

In the "March 7" directive, Chairman Mao said: "The army should, in batches, conduct military training for universities, middle schools, and upper-grade primary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, rectifying organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership bodies, and carrying out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we first brought the army's entire set of political and ideological work experience and the spirit of the "March 8" Brigade into the school, implementing political leadership in education. We set an example everywhere, teaching by word and deed, establishing the practice of reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to news broadcasts every day. We also helped the broad revolutionary teachers and students carry out the "one helps one, one becomes red" activities. We invited old workers and poor peasants to give "bitter and sweet" reports to the revolutionary teachers and students, conducting class education. At the same time, we frequently held meetings to share experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, inviting active learners of Chairman Mao's works to share their experiences, enhancing the revolutionary teachers and students' deep proletarian feelings towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. A new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought swept across the entire school, powerfully promoting the thought revolution of the revolutionary teachers and students.

When we first arrived at this school, dozens of mass organizations were each standing on their own, unwilling to yield, and engaged in endless "internal wars." In response to this situation, we, together with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, repeatedly and seriously studied and deeply understood Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive. We studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for the revolution, and also the primary question for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," starting from class education, guiding everyone to distinguish between enemies and friends, clarify right and wrong, and recognize that our common enemy is the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, China's Khrushchev. Through repeated study of the "March 7" directive, we educated the students to take the world as their responsibility, "to implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself." Many revolutionary youngsters, after raising their consciousness, said with pain, "Our class brothers fighting 'internal wars' is deviating from the grand direction of the revolutionary struggle, causing pain to our loved ones and joy to our enemies. Unless we level the hills and stop the 'internal wars,' we cannot carry out educational reform and conduct a thorough criticism; if we fail in the thorough criticism, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be half-hearted, and we will not do justice to Chairman Mao." The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations actively had heart-to-heart talks, jointly criticized and rectified their private thoughts, checked their own and their organizations' shortcomings and errors, eliminated hostile sentiments, deepened class feelings, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes.

Regarding the treatment of teachers and cadres, some students, out of hatred for the bourgeois reactionary line, were unwilling to let teachers and cadres who had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line participate in military training. We repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's teachings to the students: "During military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes. Except for the elderly and the sick, let these people participate to facilitate their reform." Chairman Mao's words have the highest authority and the greatest power; the revolutionary youngsters listen most to Chairman Mao's words. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions, recognizing that revolutionary teachers and revolutionary leading cadres, although they had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and made mistakes, their essence is good; they are our class brothers, and we should direct our hatred towards China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. With their consciousness raised, they enthusiastically put up big-character posters, warmly welcoming revolutionary leading cadres to stand up and make revolution, and enthusiastically inviting teachers to class. The leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations also actively sought out revolutionary cadres and teachers for heart-to-heart talks, helping them recognize and correct their mistakes, encouraging them to move forward lightly, and jointly fight the enemy.

The former deputy secretary of the party branch, Comrade Liu Yinshan, comes from a good family background and has always been active and responsible in his work. In the early stages of the movement, he implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, but through studying Chairman Mao's works and relevant documents from the central authorities, he quickly recognized his mistakes and fiercely launched a "counterattack." Among the school's cadres, he was the first to put up a big-character poster, rebelling against a handful of capitalist roaders within the old Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee. The handful of capitalist roaders within the party hated him to death, calling him a "traitor" and wanting to expel him from the party. Under the white terror, Comrade Liu Yinshan still firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary proletarian faction, fought against the capitalist roaders, and bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Initially, some people had objections to liberating Comrade Liu Yinshan, believing that all cadres who had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line should be overthrown. On one hand, we introduced Comrade Liu Yinshan's overall situation to the broad revolutionary teachers and students, explaining that although he made serious mistakes in the early stages of the movement, from the perspective of his entire history and work, he is still a relatively good cadre. On the other hand, we organized everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's cadre policy, deeply understanding Chairman Mao's teachings on "looking at, helping, and punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, treating diseases to save people" regarding cadres who have made mistakes. We explained that to cadres who have made mistakes, not distinguishing between right and wrong and beating them with one stick is definitely not Chairman Mao's cadre policy, definitely not our party's tradition, but the bourgeois reactionary line. With the help of the military training camp and the revolutionary teachers and students, Comrade Liu Yinshan also made a soul-searching self-criticism, gaining the understanding of the masses. Everyone not only agreed to liberate him but also let him serve as the chairman of the school revolutionary committee.

On April 1, 1967, the school established a revolutionary committee. Since then, the work of the entire school has been more on the right track.

In the fierce and complex struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads in the Shijiazhuang area, the broad revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school firmly believed in and relied on the People's Liberation Army, overcoming interference from the right and the ultra-"left," bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The entire school quickly launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. Through revolutionary criticism, the consciousness of the broad revolutionary teachers and students reached an unprecedented height, further consolidating revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one" combination, powerfully promoting the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Currently, the First Middle School presents a vibrant scene. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are thriving, and the school grounds are filled with Chairman Mao's great image and the revolutionary teachers and students' heartfelt wishes for Chairman Mao. The revolutionary teachers and students deeply and emotionally say, "In the past, we followed the lead of grades; now, we follow the lead of Mao Zedong Thought."

Through summarizing the work of the past year, the revolutionary teachers and students have a deeper understanding that the greatest favor in the world is Chairman Mao's favor, and the best thing in the world is the People's Liberation Army. There are countless experiences, but the most important is to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fully implementing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and a series of latest directives. This is the key to the key, the core of the core. While enthusiastically discussing their achievements, the revolutionary teachers and students also seriously identified their weak links, determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with "criticizing and rectifying private thoughts and the bourgeoisie" as the guiding principle, to further deepen the revolutionary criticism, carry out educational reform, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the revisionist educational line, and resolutely become "proletarian revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

　　毛主席“三·七”指示是引导我们前进的灯塔
　　河北省石家庄市新一中军训营
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席发出光辉的“三·七”指示一周年的时候，石家庄市新一中革命师生和执行军训任务的解放军一起，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的激情，认真地回顾了一年来的战斗历程，对毛主席的“三·七”指示，开展了轰轰烈烈的大庆祝、大学习、大宣传、大落实的活动。大家进一步认识到：毛主席的“三·七”指示是一个伟大的历史文献，把大、中、小学的无产阶级文化大革命推进到一个新阶段。一年来，石家庄市新一中的革命师生，沿着毛主席“三·七”指示开辟的航道前进，在开展军政训练、复课闹革命和教育革命等方面，都获得了重大的成就。
    毛主席在“三·七”指示中说：“军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。”我们遵照毛主席的教导，首先把部队的一整套政治思想工作经验和三八作风带进了学校，实行政治建校，处处以身作则，口传身教，建立了天天读毛主席的书，天天听时事广播等制度，并帮助广大革命师生开展了“一帮一、一对红”活动。我们还请苦大仇深的老工人、老贫农向革命师生作忆苦思甜报告，进行阶级教育。同时，经常召开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，请学习毛主席著作积极分子介绍经验，增强革命师生对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的深厚的无产阶级感情，在全校迅速地掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮，有力地促进了革命师生的思想革命化。
    我们刚到这个学校时，全校几十个群众组织各立山头，互不服气，“内战”不休。针对这种情况，我们就和广大革命师生一起，一遍又一遍地认真学习、深刻领会毛主席的“三·七”指示，学习毛主席关于“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题”的教导，从阶级教育入手，引导大家分清敌我，明辨是非，认识到我们的共同敌人是党内一小撮走资派，是中国赫鲁晓夫。通过反复学习“三·七”指示，教育同学们要以天下为己任，“实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导”。很多革命小将在提高了觉悟以后，痛心地说：“我们阶级弟兄之间打‘内战’，就是背离了革命斗争的大方向，使亲者痛，仇者快，不削平山头，不停止‘内战’，就不能进行教育革命和开展革命的大批判；搞不好大批判，无产阶级文化大革命就会半途而废，就对不起毛主席他老人家。”各革命群众组织的头头主动地在一起谈心、交心，共同斗私批修，各自检查了自己和本组织的缺点错误，消除了对立情绪，加深了阶级感情，全校迅速地实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合。
    在对待教师和干部问题上，开始有的同学出于对资产阶级反动路线的愤恨，不愿意让执行过资产阶级反动路线的教师和干部参加军训。我们就向同学们反复宣传毛主席关于“在军训时不要排斥犯错误的教师和干部。除老年和生病的以外，要让这些人参加，以利改造”的教导，毛主席的话威信最高，威力最大，革命小将最听毛主席的话。他们遵照毛主席的教导，认识到革命的教师和革命的领导干部，虽然执行过资产阶级反动路线，犯了错误，但他们本质是好的，是自己的阶级兄弟，应该把仇恨集中在中国赫鲁晓夫和党内一小撮走资派身上。大家认识提高了，纷纷贴出大字报，热烈欢迎革命的领导干部站出来革命，敲锣打鼓把教师们请到班里。革命群众组织的头头还主动地找革命干部、教师谈心，帮助他们认识和改正错误，鼓励他们轻装前进，共同对敌。
    原党支部副书记刘银山同志，家庭出身好，工作一贯积极负责。他在运动初期执行了资产阶级反动路线，但是通过学习毛主席著作和中央的有关文件，很快地就认识了错误，而且猛杀了“回马枪”。在学校的干部中，他第一个贴出大字报，造了旧石家庄市委内一小撮走资派的反。党内一小撮走资派把他恨得要死，说他是“叛徒”，要开除他的党籍。在白色恐怖下，刘银山同志仍然坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，同走资派作斗争，勇敢地捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。最初，一些群众对解放刘银山同志有意见，认为凡是执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部都要打倒。我们一方面向广大革命师生介绍刘银山同志的全面情况，说明他虽然在运动初期犯了严重错误，但是从大节来看，从他的全部历史和全部工作来看，还是一个比较好的干部。另方面，我们还组织大家认真学习毛主席的干部政策，深刻领会毛主席关于对犯错误的干部要一看二帮，要“惩前毖后，治病救人”的教导。说明对犯错误的干部，不问青红皂白，一棍子打死，这决不是毛主席的干部政策，决不是我们党的传统，而是资产阶级反动路线。在军训营和革命师生的帮助下，刘银山同志也作了触及灵魂的检查，取得了群众的谅解，大家不但同意解放他，而且让他担任了校革命委员会主任委员。
    去年四月一日，这个学校就成立了革命委员会。从此以后，全校的工作更加走上了正轨。
    在石家庄地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线尖锐复杂的斗争中，全校广大革命师生坚决地相信和依靠人民解放军，排除了来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰，勇敢地捍卫了毛泽东思想，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。全校迅速掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。通过革命的大批判，广大革命师生的思想觉悟空前提高，进一步巩固了革命的大联合和“三结合”，有力地推动了学校的斗、批、改。
    目前，新一中呈现出一派朝气蓬勃的大好景象，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班越办越好，校院内到处能看到毛主席的伟大形象，到处能听到革命师生对毛主席发自肺腑的祝愿。革命师生无限深情地说：“过去，我们是分数挂帅，现在，我们是毛泽东思想挂帅。”
    通过对一年来工作的总结，革命师生更加深刻地认识到，天大地大，不如毛主席的恩情大，千好万好，不如解放军好。经验有千条万条，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，全面落实毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示是第一条。这是关键的关键，核心的核心。革命师生在畅谈成绩的同时，还认真地找出了薄弱环节，决心要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，更加深入地开展革命的大批判，开展教育革命，彻底肃清修正主义教育路线的流毒，誓做“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”。
