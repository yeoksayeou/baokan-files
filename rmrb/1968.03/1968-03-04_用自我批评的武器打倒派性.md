Chairman Mao teaches us: “The two sides should speak less about each other’s shortcomings and mistakes. Let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes. Each side should engage in more self-criticism, seeking great unity and preserving minor differences.” To thoroughly eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism from the mind, we must follow Chairman Mao’s teaching and launch a revolution within our souls, earnestly engaging in self-criticism.

Liu Yonghai: Chairman Mao teaches us: “We must fight selfishness and criticize revisionism.” The PLA comrades who support the left helped us organize a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Initially, I was afraid of being criticized and didn’t want to go. The PLA comrades asked me why I didn’t want to go, and I said, “I have no selfish thoughts, and my family background is red.” They continued to encourage me to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought study class. Later, I found five comrades who shared my views and went together, planning to just get through the session. The PLA comrades also invited Liu Shikuang from the other side to participate in the study class. In the class, Liu Shikuang and I sat facing each other, and the more I looked at him, the more uncomfortable I felt.

In the study class, the PLA comrades gave us the first lesson on Chairman Mao’s wisdom and greatness, asking us to compare Mao Zedong Thought with our own thoughts. The second lesson was about recalling hardships and sweetness. A female comrade spoke about the suffering under the reactionary bourgeois line, which deeply moved me. On the third day, the PLA comrades talked about the great significance of “fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism” and shared Chairman Mao’s latest instructions: “As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve great unity under revolutionary principles.” They also said that Chairman Mao calls on us to speak less about others’ shortcomings and to engage in more self-criticism. My understanding was that speaking less about others’ shortcomings does not mean not speaking about them at all. Therefore, in my speech, I first mentioned others’ mistakes and then said I was also wrong. When I spoke this way, the PLA comrades helped me, asking me to engage in more self-criticism. In my next speech, I said, “You cursed us, and we beat you. We were wrong,” implying that they made mistakes first and we made mistakes later. The PLA comrades patiently helped me study Chairman Mao’s latest instructions: “Let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes.” Later, I said, “Comrade Liu Shikuang, I was wrong to beat you before. I will go back to the factory to apologize to you.” This sentence was difficult for me to say, and I had to muster my courage several times before I could say it. But to my surprise, as soon as I finished speaking, Comrade Liu Shikuang stood up and said, “You don’t need to apologize. I should apologize to you. We should settle all accounts with the reactionary bourgeois line and direct all our hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev.” Through fighting selfishness, I deepened my understanding of Chairman Mao’s latest instructions and increased my awareness of overcoming factionalism. Based on our common fight against selfishness and revisionism, we launched the “Pair of Reds” activity. Liu Shikuang and I transformed from a “pair of enemies” into a “pair of reds.”

Liu Shikuang: With the help of the PLA comrades, my understanding gradually improved. Especially after studying Chairman Mao’s latest instructions: “The two sides should speak less about each other’s shortcomings and mistakes. Let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes. Each side should engage in more self-criticism,” I further realized that if we don’t engage in self-criticism, we won’t be able to solve the problem even if we sit for ten days, let alone a month. I initially wanted to engage in self-criticism first, but I also thought that I shouldn’t reveal everything at once. I should start with a little and see the effect. If it’s good, I’ll continue; if it’s not, I’ll stop. The next day, Liu Yonghai spoke first. When I heard his self-criticism, I couldn’t sit still any longer and started my self-criticism as well. Each side engaged in self-criticism, and all the knots from the past year were untied. In the past, I felt angry and uncomfortable whenever I saw Liu Yonghai. But once the factionalism was overcome, I felt that he was also a comrade following Chairman Mao to make revolution.

### 用自我批评的武器打倒派性

    用自我批评的武器打倒派性
    毛主席教导我们：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”要从思想上彻底消除资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就必须遵照毛主席的这一教导，在自己的灵魂深处爆发革命，认真地进行自我批评。
    刘永海：毛主席教导我们：“要斗私，批修”。支左的解放军同志帮助我们举办了毛泽东思想学习班，开始我怕挨批评，不去。解放军同志问我为嘛不去，我说，我没私心杂念，我出身历史是红的。他继续动员我参加毛泽东思想学习班。后来我就找了五个跟我同观点的同志一起去，准备混他一期。解放军同志还要另一派的刘士宽也参加学习班。在学习班里，我和刘士宽面对面坐着，越看越别扭。
    解放军同志在学习班上，第一课给我们讲毛主席的英明、伟大，要我们用毛泽东思想同自己的思想对对号。第二课，忆苦思甜。一个女同志忆受资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，使我很受感动。第三天，解放军同志讲“斗私，批修”的伟大意义，又讲了毛主席的最新指示：
  “只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”他还说，毛主席号召我们要少讲别人的缺点，要多作自我批评。我的理解是，少讲对方的缺点，不等于不讲对方的缺点。因此，在发言中，我先说人家有错误，再说我也错了。我这样一讲，解放军同志就帮助我，要我多做自我批评。再发言时，我说，你们骂了我们，我们打了你们，我们错了，以此含沙射影，说明是他们先犯错误，我们后犯错误的。解放军同志又耐心地帮助我学习毛主席的最新指示：“别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲”。后来我才说：“刘士宽同志，以前打你，的确错了，回厂给你赔礼道歉。”这一句话憋了好几天，下了几次狠心，就是不愿讲出口。可是没想到，我刚说完，刘士宽同志就站起来说：“你不用赔礼道歉了，我还要向你赔礼道歉呢。千笔账，万笔账，我们要算在资产阶级反动路线上，千仇万恨要集中在中国赫鲁晓夫身上。”通过斗私，我对毛主席的最新指示加深了理解，提高了克服派性的自觉性。我们在共同斗私批修的基础上，开展了“一对红”活动。我和刘士宽由“一对冤家”变成了“一对红”。
    刘士宽：经过解放军同志的帮助，我的认识逐步提高了。特别是学习了毛主席的最新指示：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评”，我进一步认识到，要是都不做自我批评，不要说坐十天，就是坐一个月，也解决不了问题。我本想先做自我批评，但是我又想，还是不要一下子什么都讲出去，先少讲一点，看看风向，效果好再说，效果不好就打住。第二天刘永海先说了，我一听他的检查，也就坐不住了，紧接着我也检查开了。各自都做自我批评，把一年多结下的疙瘩都解开了。过去看刘永海打心眼里生气，怎么看怎么别扭；派性一倒，就怎么看怎么顺眼了，感到人家也是紧跟毛主席闹革命的。
