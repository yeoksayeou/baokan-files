    Facing an accelerating and developing financial crisis, the capitalist world is in a state of panic and chaos. The U.S. imperialist ruling clique, at the forefront of this crisis, scrambled to take a series of "emergency" measures on the evening of the 14th, desperately struggling to escape the misfortune of this crisis.

    On the capitalist world's financial markets, the trend of selling dollars and pounds and buying gold, which has continued for more than two weeks, became even more intense on the 13th and 14th. This trend not only swept through various financial centers in Western Europe but also spread to financial markets in the Far East and South Africa. In many Western European countries' gold markets, transaction volumes repeatedly broke records, with some markets seeing gold being bought out entirely. Brokers in some major markets had to close their doors shortly after opening, stopping the acceptance of gold purchase orders that were pouring in like a tidal wave. On the 14th, the London market's gold transaction volume further surged to an unprecedented 225 tons, with gold prices reaching their highest point since 1960, while the pound's exchange rate fell to its lowest point in history. In Paris, the volume of gold purchases doubled the previous day's record, with the market in a frenzy of panic, especially in the last few minutes before closing, reaching a "mad" level.

    Facing the imminent danger of the dollar's position and the capitalist world's currency system being swept away by the frenzied gold-buying tide, the U.S. ruling clique, in a state of panic, took a series of emergency measures on the evening of the 14th, attempting to calm the storm and stabilize the dollar's position.

    These measures included: U.S. President Johnson directly urging British Prime Minister Wilson via the "hotline" to close the London gold market, attempting to halt the gold-buying activities in the world's largest gold market; announcing an increase in the U.S. bank discount rate (the interest rate at which the Federal Reserve lends to commercial banks) from 4.5% to 5%, the highest since the eve of the 1929 capitalist world crisis, attempting to absorb idle funds, control domestic inflation, and improve the dollar's precarious position; urgently convening the central bank governors of Western European partner countries in the "gold pool" to Washington for a meeting to discuss ways to cope with the current emergency situation; and canceling the legal gold reserve for the dollar to use part of the gold reserves originally used as a guarantee for domestic dollar currency (approximately $10.6 billion) to cope with the storm.

    None of these measures can fundamentally improve the dollar's position or effectively cope with the current wave of selling dollars and buying gold. On the contrary, the hasty adoption of these measures reflects the panic of the U.S. monopoly capitalist clique. For this reason, these measures, after being announced, not only failed to calm the storm but further increased the chaos in the Western financial markets. For example, just four hours after the U.S. announced the increase in the bank discount rate, Canada followed suit by raising its discount rate from 6.5% to 7% to prevent capital from flowing into the U.S., and also announced the suspension of all gold transactions; British banks also decided to suspend operations on the 15th to study the impact of the U.S. rate hike on Britain, causing British business activities to come to a halt. It was announced that Japan's Ministry of Finance also decided to hold an emergency meeting on the 15th to study the impact of this U.S. move on Japan's finance.

    The news indicates that the chaos in the capitalist world's financial markets has already caused severe fluctuations in the stock and commodity markets. On the 14th, stock prices in New York and Tokyo experienced a sharp decline.

　　黄金抢购风暴猛刮　西方金融危机临头
　　资本主义世界一片恐慌混乱
　　美国统治集团手忙脚乱采取“抢险”措施无法平息危机
　　西方主要黄金市场宣布停业，股票和商品市场剧烈动荡
    据新华社十五日讯　面临着一场正在加速形成和发展的金融危机，西方资本主义世界陷于一片恐慌与混乱之中，首当其冲的美帝国主义的统治集团在十四日晚间手忙脚乱地采取了一系列“抢险”措施，紧张地进行挣扎，妄图逃脱这场危机袭击的厄运。
    在资本主义世界金融市场上，持续已经两个多星期的抛售美元、英镑，抢购黄金的风潮，在十三日和十四日发展得更加猛烈，不仅席卷了西欧各金融中心，而且蔓延到了远东和南非的一些金融市场。在许多西欧国家的黄金市场上，成交量一再突破纪录数字，有的市场上，黄金被抢购一空。一些主要市场上的经纪人不得不在开市后不久就宣布关门，停止接受如潮水般涌来的订购黄金货单。伦敦市场十四日的黄金成交量进一步猛增到二百二十五吨的空前规模，金价涨到了一九六○年以来的最高点，而英镑牌价则跌到了历史上的最低点。在巴黎，黄金的抢购量比前一天的最高纪录又增加了两倍，市场上一片狂热和恐慌气氛，特别在关市前几分钟达到了“疯狂程度”。
    面对着美元地位和美元所代表的资本主义世界货币体系随时有被疯狂抢购黄金的狂澜冲垮的严重危险，美国统治集团仓惶失措地在十四日晚上采取了一系列紧急措施，妄图平息抢风，稳住美元地位。
    这一系列措施是：美国总统约翰逊通过“热线”直接央求英国首相威尔逊关闭伦敦的黄金市场，企图刹住这个资本主义世界最大的黄金市场上的抢购活动；宣布把美国的银行贴现率（即联邦储备银行向商业银行放款的利率）由百分之四点五提高到百分之五，这是一九二九年资本主义世界大危机前夕以来的最高峰，妄图以此吸收游资、控制国内的通货膨胀，以改善美元的垂危地位；紧急召集“黄金总库”中的西欧伙伴国中央银行行长去华盛顿开会，讨论应付当前危急局势的办法；取消美元的法定黄金后备，以便动用黄金储备中原来充作国内美元通货保证金的部分（约一百零六亿美元）来应付抢风。
    这些措施的任何一项都不能从根本上改善美元的地位，真正有力地应付目前抛售美元、抢购黄金的浪潮，相反，仓促采取这些措施正反映了美国垄断资本集团的慌乱。正因为这样，这些措施宣布后，不仅没有平息抢风，反而更进一步增加了西方金融市场的混乱。例如，在美国宣布提高银行贴现率之后不过四小时，加拿大就跟着宣布把贴现率由百分之六点五提高到百分之七，以防止资金流往美国，并且宣布暂停一切黄金交易；英国各银行也决定在十五日停止营业，以便研究美国提高贴现率对英国的影响，英国的企业活动已因此陷于停顿。据宣布，日本大藏省也决定在十五日召开紧急会议，研究美国此举对日本金融的影响。
    消息表明，资本主义世界金融市场的混乱，已经引起了股票市场和商品市场的剧烈动荡。纽约和东京的股票行情十四日出现了暴跌。
