The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region, who are tasked with supporting agriculture, helped the Yongdian People's Commune in Liaoning Province's Kuandian County to hold study classes on Mao Zedong Thought as the spring plowing season approached. Using Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles" as weapons, they enthusiastically helped the grassroots cadres establish a thorough and complete thought of serving the people, grasp the revolution to promote production, and become good cadres who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Most of the grassroots cadres in the Yongdian People's Commune were able to stand firm at their posts and lead production during the Cultural Revolution. However, some cadres, after being criticized by the masses during the movement, dared not work boldly when they stood up again. The military personnel supporting agriculture addressed this issue by assisting the commune in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes as the spring plowing season approached. They organized grassroots cadres to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and this teaching: "At present, it is the spring plowing season. I hope that all leaders, cadres, and masses in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the links in production and achieve greater results than last year." The cadres were deeply moved and said: This year is the year to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. What attitude should we take towards Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp the revolution and promote production"? Is it to implement it or not? This is the touchstone of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Following this, the military personnel supporting agriculture led the way, guiding everyone to link the current class struggle reality, study Chairman Mao's related theories on class and class struggle, making everyone realize that the tense spring plowing production has begun. If revolutionary cadres do not dare to boldly shoulder the double burdens of revolution and production, this is exactly what the class enemies need, and it will inevitably harm the fundamental interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants, affecting the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

After the class consciousness of the grassroots cadres was raised, they worked hard and boldly grasped the revolution to promote production. However, after some time, some cadres' enthusiasm for work was affected because they could not correctly handle the criticisms from the masses. After discovering this problem, the military personnel supporting agriculture organized these cadres to review Chairman Mao's related teachings, and at the same time, study the deeds of two good cadres in the commune who were highly praised by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

One of these good cadres was Ye Rongshan, the political squad leader of the 14th Production Brigade of Yongdian Brigade. Since he became a cadre, he has actively led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to walk the socialist road. The community members praised him as a good squad leader in the style of Chen Yonggui. Last winter, he followed Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture" and led the community members to build Dazhai fields. Because of overwork, his body gradually became thin. At this time, some community members criticized him for not having enough enthusiasm. Many community members did not agree with this criticism. Everyone said: "Comrade Ye leads us poor and lower-middle peasants to shoulder heavy burdens, work through the night, do the hardest work, and take the least pay. He never complains about hardship or fatigue. Where can we find such a good cadre? You still criticize him?" However, Ye Rongshan did not think this way. After hearing the community members' criticisms, he used the two "extremes" as a standard to strictly demand of himself. He said: "The community members' criticisms show that I have not done my work well and have not done it 'completely' and 'thoroughly.'" Since then, with greater revolutionary enthusiasm, he worked with the masses to open mountains, build fields, screen stones, and fill the ground, turning the barren mountains into "Dazhai fields," laying a solid foundation for greater agricultural harvests this year. The other good cadre is Meng Guangcai, the deputy secretary of the Yongdian Brigade Party Branch. Once, an old poor peasant community member, Wu Zhenyu, had ideological problems. Meng Guangcai went to his home to do ideological work to persuade Wu Zhenyu to walk the socialist road as indicated by Chairman Mao, but Wu Zhenyu created a rift with him instead. Meng Guangcai did not lose heart and continued to patiently do ideological work with Wu Zhenyu, helping him study Chairman Mao's works, recall class bitterness, and criticize the fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract" by the Chinese Khrushchev, finally making him raise his awareness. After studying the deeds of these two good cadres, everyone was greatly inspired. They said, to be a good cadre of Chairman Mao, one must firmly establish the thought of serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly," and use the two "extremes" as a measure for oneself throughout one's life. Only in this way can one gain the support and approval of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Currently, the broad grassroots cadres of this commune are actively leading the broad masses of community members, grasping the revolution, and vigorously promoting spring plowing production. The entire commune has presented a great situation of revolutionary flames burning and production waves surging.

    树立完全彻底为人民服务思想
    基层干部勇挑革命和生产重担
    沈阳部队某部指战员帮助永甸公社办学习班提高了干部的觉悟
    新华社沈阳电　沈阳部队某部担任支农任务的指战员，在春耕季节来临的时候，帮助辽宁省宽甸县永甸公社大办毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席最新指示和“老三篇”为武器，热情帮助基层干部树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想，抓革命促生产，做永远忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部。
    永甸公社的基层干部在文化大革命中，绝大多数都能坚守岗位，领导生产。但是，有些干部因为在运动中受到群众的冲击，站出来以后不敢大胆工作。部队支农人员针对这个问题，在春耕大忙到来的时候，协助公社开办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织基层干部学习毛主席的最新指示和这一教导：“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”干部们深受教育，他们说：今年是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一年。对毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针抱什么态度，是执行还是不执行，这是忠不忠于毛主席的试金石。接着，部队支农人员又因势利导，启发大家联系当前阶级斗争实际，学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，使大家认识到，当前，紧张的春耕生产已经开始，革命干部如果不敢大胆地挑起革命、生产两副重担，那正是迎合了阶级敌人的需要，必然使贫下中农的根本利益受到损失，影响文化大革命的全面胜利。
    基层干部的阶级觉悟提高以后，努力工作，大胆抓革命促生产。但是过了一段时间，有的干部因为不能正确对待群众对他们的批评，工作积极性又受到影响。部队支农人员发现这个问题后，组织这些干部重温毛主席的有关教导，同时学习本社两位深受贫下中农热情称赞的好干部的事迹。
    这两个好干部，一个是永甸大队第十四生产队的政治队长叶荣山。他自从当干部以来，积极带领广大贫下中农走社会主义道路，社员称赞他是陈永贵式的好队长。去年冬天，他遵照毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，带领社员建设大寨田。因为过于劳累，身体渐渐消瘦下来。这时，有的社员批评他劲头鼓得不足。很多社员都不同意这个批评。大伙说：“叶队长给咱贫下中农挑重担子，披星戴月，干活拣重的，报酬要少的，从来不叫一声苦，从来不说一声累，哪里能挑出这样的好干部，你们还批评他？”可是，叶荣山却不这样想。他听了社员的批评以后，用两个“极端”作标准来严格要求自己，他说：“社员们的批评，说明我还没有把工作做好，还没有做到‘完全’
  ‘彻底’。”从那以后，他以更大的革命干劲和群众一起，开山辟田，筛石填地，把荒山变成了“大寨田”，为今年夺取农业更大的丰收打下了坚实的基础。另一个是永甸大队党支部副书记孟广才。一次，老贫农社员吴振玉闹思想问题，孟广才为了说服吴振玉走毛主席指引的社会主义道路，到他家做思想工作，不料吴振玉反而同他产生了隔阂。孟广才并没有灰心，继续耐心地对吴振玉做思想工作，帮助他学习毛主席著作，忆阶级苦，批判中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的谬论，终于使他提高了认识。大家学习了这两个好干部的事迹以后，受到很大启发，他们说，作毛主席的好干部，就要牢固树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想，一辈子用两个“极端”为尺子衡量自己。只有这样，才能受到广大贫下中农的拥护和支持。
    目前，这个公社广大基层干部积极带领广大社员，狠抓革命，猛促春耕生产，全公社出现了革命烈火熊熊、生产热潮滚滚的大好局面。
