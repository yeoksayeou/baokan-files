Our great leader Chairman Mao has long said: “Different ideas and struggles within the party are constantly occurring. This is a reflection of class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things within the party. If there are no contradictions and ideological struggles to resolve them within the party, the party's life would cease.” Our Dazhai Party Branch has grown and strengthened by following Chairman Mao's teachings and consciously and proactively engaging in intra-party struggles.

For a long time, China's Khrushchev has distorted intra-party struggles, attempting to abolish them. He says things like: “Because various party members have different ways of looking at problems, their methods of handling problems are also different, leading to many disagreements and debates within the party, leading to struggles within the party.” This is all deceitful nonsense.

During China's democratic revolution and socialist revolution periods, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat has never stopped. This intense class struggle inevitably reflects within the party. In 1947, shortly after the establishment of the Dazhai Party Branch, a party member with an unstable class stance was targeted by class enemies. A landlord who was missed during land reform married his daughter to this party member's son. Subsequently, a few other landlords and rich peasants of the same surname established kinship ties with this party member. For a period, this party member became passive, not participating in the struggle against landlords during land reform and maintaining close ties with landlords and rich peasants. Is this a matter of different ways of looking at problems? No! This is a matter of which class stance one takes, whether to overthrow the landlord class or surrender to it. We conducted struggles within the party, and through repeated criticism and education, this party member came to his senses and drew a clear line with landlords and rich peasants. This also educated other party members.

The wind does not stop just because the tree wants to be still. In 1957, rightists launched a fierce attack on the party, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements all came out. This class struggle also reflected within the party. Two party members stood on the side of landlords and rich peasants, echoing the class enemies and publicly attacking the branch leaders who advocated selling more surplus grain to the state. They advocated reporting as little grain as possible from what was harvested and attacked the superiority of the socialist collective economy. Is this a matter of different ways of looking at problems? No, this is a public opposition to the socialist revolution, aiming to restore capitalism. After repeated criticism and struggle, they were eventually given disciplinary punishments. If we followed China's Khrushchev's reasoning, all this would just be “different ways of looking at problems” and “different methods of handling problems,” and there would be no need for serious struggle. If we followed China's Khrushchev's reasoning, there would be no Dazhai Party Branch today, and there would be no new Dazhai.

China's Khrushchev reduces intra-party struggles to “different ways of looking at problems” with his ulterior motives. Because he has long hung the sign of “old revolutionary” and “old party member” while engaging in counter-revolutionary activities, he is most afraid of others using class analysis to expose his reactionary words and deeds.

We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and correctly conduct intra-party struggles. Regularly and consciously engaging in intra-party struggles can save comrades who have made mistakes but are willing to correct them; it can expose bad elements who have infiltrated the party, like China's Khrushchev; and it can also educate other party members. The Dazhai Party Branch, following Chairman Mao, correctly understands and conducts intra-party struggles, making the party branch a strong leadership core for the brigade and achieving new victories in the three great revolutionary movements.

### 经常自觉地进行党内斗争

    经常自觉地进行党内斗争
    大寨大队党支部委员、副大队长　贾来恒
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早就说过：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”我们大寨党支部就是按照毛主席的这一教导，在经常自觉地主动地进行党内斗争中发展壮大起来的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫长期以来歪曲党内斗争，妄图取消党内斗争。他说什么：“因为各种党员看问题的方法不同，就使他们处理问题的方法也各不相同，就引起党内许多不同意见、不同主张的分歧和争论，就引起党内的斗争。”这完全是骗人的鬼话。
    在我国民主革命时期和社会主义革命时期，资产阶级同无产阶级的斗争从来没有停止过，这种激烈的阶级斗争必然要反映到党内来。一九四七年，大寨党支部建立不久，一个阶级立场不稳的党员被阶级敌人看中了。一户土改中被漏划的富农把女儿嫁给了这个党员的儿子，接着另外几户同姓的地主、富农也和这个党员续家谱，拉关系。在一段时间内，这个党员消极起来，土改中斗争地主，他不参加，还和地主、富农搞得很热乎。这是看问题的方法不同吗？不！这是站在什么立场上的问题，是要打倒地主阶级还是投降地主阶级的问题。我们在党内开展了斗争，经过多次批评教育，使这个党员觉悟过来，同地主、富农划清了界线。同时也教育了其他党员。
    树欲静而风不止。一九五七年右派向党发起猖狂进攻，地、富、反、坏分子又一齐出笼，这场阶级斗争又反映到党内来。有两个党员站在地主、富农立场上，和阶级敌人一唱一和，公开攻击主张多卖余粮给国家的支部负责人，他们主张打下的粮食尽量少报，他们攻击社会主义集体经济没有优越性。这是看问题的方法不同吗？不，这是公开反对社会主义革命，让资本主义复辟。经过多次批判斗争，最后分别给予纪律处分。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说法，这都仅仅是“看问题的方法不同”，“处理问题的方法也各不相同”，那就用不着进行严肃的斗争了。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说法去做，那就不会有今天的大寨党支部，也不会有今天的新大寨。
    中国赫鲁晓夫把党内斗争归结为“看问题的方法不同”，是有他的阴谋的。因为他长期以来挂着“老革命”、“老党员”的招牌，干着反革命的勾当，他最害怕别人用阶级分析方法来透视他的反动言行。
    我们一定要坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，正确地进行党内斗争。经常自觉地进行党内斗争，可以把犯了错误但愿改正的同志及早挽救过来；可以把钻进党内的坏人、象中国赫鲁晓夫这样的人揪出来；也可以使其他党员受到教育。大寨党支部紧跟毛主席，正确地认识和进行党内斗争，就使党支部成为大队的坚强领导核心，在三大革命运动中不断取得新的胜利。
