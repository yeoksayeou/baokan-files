Palestinian guerrillas have launched a series of attacks on Israeli invading forces in late February and early March, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. These attacks are a powerful response to the recent conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Israel to annex occupied Arab territories.

The underground Palestinian nationalist organization "Fatah" issued a series of battle reports in Damascus on March 3 and 4, stating: On the night of March 3, the Palestinian "Storm" commando units on the West Bank of the Jordan River in Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Hebron, and the Gaza Strip launched a series of attacks on Israeli military targets, shooting down one Israeli military helicopter and destroying several armored vehicles.

On the night of February 2, a "Storm" commando unit in Abu Ghosh, Jerusalem, attacked a military engineering vehicle garage, killing three Israeli soldiers, destroying many vehicles, and burning down the oil depot there.

On the night of February 1, another "Storm" commando unit blew up an enemy military camp in Hawara on the West Bank of the Jordan River, causing heavy losses to the enemy. The commando unit also ambushed an enemy convoy, destroying three Israeli military trucks and killing or wounding fifteen enemy soldiers.

The "Fatah" battle report issued in Cairo on February 28 said: From February 23 to 25, "Storm" commando fighters on the West Bank of the Jordan River launched four successful attacks on Israeli invading forces, destroying two enemy vehicles, damaging some Israeli military facilities, and killing or wounding many Israeli soldiers.

The "Storm" commando units also distributed leaflets in the Arab regions occupied by Israel, calling on the Arab people to fight against the Israeli invaders.

According to reports from Cairo newspapers, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian guerrillas recently attacked an Israeli police station with grenades. They also blew up an Israeli jeep with landmines near the village of Zadamotai in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, killing two Israelis in the vehicle.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Damascus, Palestinian guerrillas have launched a series of attacks on the enemy in the Israeli-occupied areas in recent periods, achieving new victories. During this period, Palestinian guerrillas conducted extensive guerrilla activities in the West Bank region occupied by Israel. According to a battle report recently issued by the underground Palestinian nationalist organization "Fatah" here, on the night of February 19, a unit led by this organization attacked an Israeli invading military camp in the Jenin region of the West Bank, destroying a large part of the camp, killing and wounding many Israeli officers who were holding a meeting, and destroying three tracked vehicles and two jeeps. The panicked enemy quickly dispatched reinforcements to surround the area, but Palestinian fighters broke through the encirclement and, after causing other losses to the enemy, withdrew to their base.

On the night of February 20, a "Storm" commando unit led by this organization blew up the main hydroelectric power station in Ein Arus south of the Dead Sea.

On the night of February 22, another "Storm" commando unit ambushed an Israeli military truck in the Khan al-Ahmar region of the West Bank, killing and wounding three Israeli soldiers.

On the night of February 24, the "Storm" commando unit engaged in a half-hour battle with Israeli invading forces near Al-Araha on the West Bank, killing and wounding some enemy soldiers.

During this period, Palestinian commando units also conducted guerrilla activities in the Syrian regions occupied by Israel. According to a battle report recently issued by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine here, on the night of February 20, three Palestinian commando units attacked Israeli invading forces stationed in the Qubein region of the Golan Heights, destroying part of the enemy's barbed wire, burning down an Israeli guard post, and killing all of an Israeli ambush unit. After this, the enemy turned off the lights, fired multiple flares, and dispatched two armored vehicles for reinforcement. As a result, the first armored vehicle was blown up by anti-tank mines set by the commando unit on the road, and the other escaped.

On February 20, Palestinian guerrillas attacked the Israeli military command center in Gaza City four times with grenades.

    二月二十日夜间，这个组织领导的一支“暴风”突击队炸毁在死海以南艾因阿鲁斯的主要水电站。

    二月二十日，巴勒斯坦游击队用手榴弹四次袭击了加沙市内的以色列军指挥部。
