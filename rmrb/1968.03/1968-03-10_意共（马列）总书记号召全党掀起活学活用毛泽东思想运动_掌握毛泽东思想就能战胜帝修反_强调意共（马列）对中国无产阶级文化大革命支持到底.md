	Rome, March 9 (New China News Agency) – Recently, Fosco Dinucci, the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), at the Party's second national organizational work conference, highly praised Mao Zedong Thought and called on the entire Party to seriously study the works of Chairman Mao, applying Mao's teachings to the revolutionary practice in Italy.

	Dinucci emphasized that the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) must carry out a revolution in ideology within the Party and strive to cultivate new types of Party members. To achieve this goal, we have the most powerful weapon in our hands: the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism – Mao Zedong Thought. We should study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" section by section and continually apply the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong to Italian reality. He said: "The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) has launched a movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. The Party should spare no effort, because as long as the Party can master Mao Zedong Thought, it will be able to defeat imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries."

	Dinucci enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He stressed that the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) will support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China to the end. The attitude towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the dividing line between true and false revolutionaries. He said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, has made 700 million Chinese people full of vigor, and has fully developed the people's spiritual and material strength. China is the most solid fortress in the anti-imperialist struggle. Any attack by imperialism is doomed to failure.

	Dinucci said: The Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) firmly opposes the "electoralism" of the Italian revisionists. He pointed out that the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) is accumulating revolutionary forces, closely combining theory with practice, and always keeping in mind the ultimate goal: to overthrow the bourgeois dictatorship and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) is making every effort to strengthen its ties with the masses.

	He finally said, the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) will carry its revolutionary struggle to the end, until victory.

    新华社九日讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）总书记福斯科·迪努齐不久前在党的第二次全国组织工作会议上，高度赞扬毛泽东思想，并号召全党认真学习毛主席著作，把毛主席的教导运用到意大利的革命实践中去。
    迪努齐强调指出：意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）必须在党内进行思想革命，努力培养新型的党员。为了达到这个目的，我们手中有最强大的武器：当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想。我们应当逐段地学习《毛主席语录》，不断地把毛泽东同志的教导运用到意大利现实中去。他说：“意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会掀起了一个活学活用毛泽东思想的运动。党应当全力以赴，因为党只要能掌握毛泽东思想，它就能够战胜帝国主义、修正主义和反动派。”
    迪努齐热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。他强调指出，意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）对中国无产阶级文化大革命支持到底，对待中国无产阶级文化大革命的态度，是真假革命者的分界线。他说：由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，使七亿中国人民意气风发，使人民的精神和物质力量得到充分的发展。中国是反帝斗争的最牢固的堡垒。帝国主义的任何进攻都是注定要失败的。
    迪努齐说：意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）坚决反对意修的“竞选主义”。他指出，意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）正在积蓄革命力量，把理论和实践紧密结合起来，永远牢记最终目标：推翻资产阶级政权并建立无产阶级专政。意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）为此正作出一切努力来加强同群众的联系。
    他最后说，意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）将把自己的革命斗争进行到底，直至胜利。
