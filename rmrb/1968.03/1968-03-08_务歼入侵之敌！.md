The heroic air force units, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, with a heart as red as blood, day and night guard their posts to defend the skies of our motherland. On March 7, an American imperialist unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft intruded into the airspace over a certain location in our southwestern region and was immediately shot down by our air force units. This brilliant victory is another great triumph of Mao Zedong Thought. We extend our warmest congratulations to the air force units that have achieved this new victory!

Recently, the powerful Tet Offensive by the military and people of South Vietnam has left American imperialism at a loss, howling in despair. In its grief, this unrepentant aggressor, in collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership, is playing both ends against the middle. It attempts to expand the war in Vietnam and launch new military adventures in a desperate struggle. However, it continues to suffer even more severe defeats on the vast battlefield of Vietnam. It has also had its fingers burned when it tried to meddle in China. The aggressive nature of American imperialism and its accomplices is doomed to failure in the face of the peoples of the world's revolution!

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote preparedness for war. They must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's battle order to "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy," be ever-vigilant, and be ready at any moment to smash any invading enemy.

The People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with Comrade Lin Biao as their shining example, is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have built an iron wall to defend socialist China and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Whether the enemy comes from the air, the sea, or the land, they will all be smashed to pieces against this great iron wall.

    务歼入侵之敌！
    本报评论员
    无限忠于毛主席的英雄空军部队，怀着“为毛主席站好岗，放好哨”的赤胆忠心，日夜坚守在保卫祖国领空的战斗岗位上。三月七日，美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机一架，刚窜入我西南某地上空，就立即被我空军部队打得粉碎。这个辉煌的战果，是毛泽东思想的又一个伟大胜利。我们谨向立下新的战功的空军部队，致以最热烈的祝贺！
    最近，越南南方军民的强大新春攻势，把美帝国主义打得一筹莫展，鬼哭狼嚎。在哀伤之余，这个死不回头的侵略强盗，还在与苏修领导集团狼狈为奸，玩弄反革命两手。它妄图用扩大侵越战争和新的军事冒险来进行垂死挣扎。但是，它在越南的广阔战场上继续遭到更惨重的失败。它把猪爪子伸进中国，也立即被斩断。侵略成性的美帝国主义及其帮凶，在世界革命人民面前，是注定要失败的！
    我人民解放军广大指战员，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，狠抓革命，猛促战备，坚决执行毛主席“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的战斗命令，常备不懈，百倍警惕，时刻准备着粉碎任何来犯之敌。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军，以林副主席为光辉榜样，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，筑成了保卫社会主义祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的钢铁长城。不管敌人是从空中来，从海上来，还是从陆地上来，都将在这座伟大的钢铁长城面前，碰得头破血流。
