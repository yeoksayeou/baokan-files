Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho calls for continued struggle in Saigon-Cholon area to achieve complete victory in the Anti-American National Salvation War

Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho writes to Prime Minister Pham Van Dong to thank the northern military and civilians for sending gifts to support the southern compatriots

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 19th, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported: On March 13th, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam wrote a letter to the people of Saigon-Cholon, warmly celebrating the 18th anniversary of the Vietnam National Anti-American Day (March 19th), and called on the people of this region to continue to fight, promote the revolutionary high tide, and achieve a complete victory in the Anti-American National Salvation War.

In reviewing the glorious history of the "March 19th" Vietnam National Anti-American Day, the letter said that the victories achieved by the military and civilians of South Vietnam since the New Year have immense significance. The military and civilians of South Vietnam have already and are pushing the liberation war into the lairs of the invading army and traitors, forming a situation of encirclement and division in various places, making them fall into a precarious passive situation, and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy's combat forces and combat equipment. Under the continuous and fatal blows of the military and civilians of South Vietnam, the military structure and ruling system of the U.S.-puppet group have fallen into chaos, the puppet army has largely disintegrated, and the U.S. and mercenary troops have suffered serious losses and annihilation. In various districts, villages, and neighborhoods, the puppet government system has almost completely collapsed. The central puppet government has become paralyzed, and internal contradictions among the enemy have become acute and chaotic. The entire new colonialist "enterprise" that the U.S. invaders have built over the years is facing the crisis of complete collapse.

The letter said that in the New Year's great victory, the revolutionary armed forces of the Saigon-Cholon area have received strong support from their compatriots and have accurately and heavily struck the headquarters of the invading army and traitors. This brilliant feat has directly inspired the people of various classes in the city to rise up and eliminate the traitors and thugs, smashing the puppet government institutions on every street.

The letter said that the great victories achieved by the military and civilians of the Saigon-Cholon area and the entire South in the past month have brought about a very rapid change in the situation in Saigon and the entire South Vietnam, creating a situation that is very favorable to the military and civilians of the South and very unfavorable to the enemy.

After pointing out that the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs are desperately taking frantic actions to save their desperate situation, the letter said: The enemy's savage crimes only expose their complete political failure and military helplessness. The extremely brutal war methods of the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs further arouse the hatred of the people of the South and strengthen the determination of the people of the South to fight.

The letter calls on the people of various classes in Saigon to press on, together with various revolutionary armed forces, to continuously attack the enemy, directly strike the headquarters, bases, and warehouses of the U.S.-puppet group, gradually tighten the encirclement, divide the enemy, and annihilate more of the enemy's combat forces.

The letter finally said, The heroic people of the Saigon-Cholon area will surely achieve the final victory! The beloved South and the motherland Vietnam will surely achieve complete victory!

According to reports from newspapers here on March 19th, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam recently wrote a letter to Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressing gratitude for the gifts sent by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the military and civilians of South Vietnam.

The letter said that at a time when the military and civilians of the South are building on the great victories of the New Year, continuously attacking the enemy, and striving to achieve a complete victory, the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have sent a batch of gifts to the military and civilians of the South. The military and civilians of the entire South are deeply grateful for the care and concern of their compatriots in the North.

The letter pointed out that the great victories achieved by the military and civilians of the South in the New Year have pushed the U.S.-puppet group into a situation from which they cannot extricate themselves. The enemy is making a desperate struggle, sending planes and using artillery to brutally bomb many densely populated areas, killing thousands of people, in an attempt to shake the determination of the people of South Vietnam to fight and win. However, the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs can only arouse greater hatred among the people of the South, making the people of the South more determined to fight and completely defeat U.S. imperialism, overthrowing the puppet government.

The letter said that at this critical and intense moment of battle, the people of the South look to the North, look to Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and pledge that under any circumstances, no matter how great the hardships and sacrifices, they will always remain loyal and resolute, fighting together with the people of the North to completely defeat U.S. imperialism and fulfill the tasks entrusted by the nation and their international duties.

　　阮友寿主席号召西贡—嘉定区军民继续战斗
　　发扬革命精神夺取抗美救国战争彻底胜利
　　阮友寿主席写信给范文同总理感谢北方军民赠送礼物支援南方同胞
    据新华社河内十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿十三日写信给西贡—嘉定区人民，热烈欢呼越南全国反美日十八周年（三月十九日），号召这个地区人民继续奋起斗争，促进革命高潮，夺取抗美救国斗争的彻底胜利。
    信中在回顾了“三·一九”越南全国反美日的光辉历史之后说，越南南方军民新春以来取得的胜利，具有无比巨大的意义。越南南方军民已经和正在把解放战争推进到侵略军和卖国贼的巢穴里，在各地形成了包围和分割它们的形势，使它们陷入岌岌可危的被动处境，并且给敌人的有生力量和作战工具造成巨大损失。在越南南方军民接连和致命的打击下，美伪集团的军事机构和统治系统陷入一片混乱，伪军大片瓦解，美军和帮凶军遭到了严重的消耗和消灭。在各个乡、村、街坊的伪政权系统，几乎全部崩溃。中央伪政权陷于瘫痪，敌人内部矛盾尖锐，混乱不堪。美国侵略者几年来建立起来的整个新殖民主义“基业”，正面临着彻底崩溃的危机。
    信中说，在新春大捷中，西贡—嘉定区革命武装力量的各个单位得到了同胞的大力支持，准确而沉重地打击了侵略军和卖国贼的首脑中心。这一辉煌战功，直接地鼓舞了市区各阶层人民浩浩荡荡地奋起消灭越奸、恶棍，粉碎各条街道的伪政权机构。
    信中说，西贡—嘉定区军民和全南方军民一个月来所取得的巨大胜利，使西贡局势和南越整个局势发生了十分迅速的变化。一个十分有利于南方军民、而十分不利于敌人的形势已经出现。
    信中谈到了美帝国主义及其走狗正在竭力采取疯狂的行动来挽救它们的绝望处境之后指出：敌人的野蛮罪行，只能暴露出它们在政治上的彻底失败、在军事上的一筹莫展。美帝国主义及其走狗的极其残暴的战争手段，更加激起南方人民的仇恨，进一步增强南方人民战斗的决心。
    信中号召西贡各阶层人民乘胜前进，同各种革命武装力量一起，连续进攻敌人，直捣美伪集团的各个首脑机关、基地、仓库，日益紧缩包围圈，分割敌人，以消灭敌人更多的有生力量。
    信中最后说，英雄的西贡—嘉定区人民必将取得最后胜利！可爱的南方和祖国越南必将获得全胜！
    新华社河内十九日电　据这里报纸十九日报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿最近写信给越南民主共和国政府总理范文同，感谢越南民主共和国政府赠送一批礼物给越南南方军民。
    信中说，正当南方军民发扬新春的巨大胜利，连续进攻敌人，以便进一步夺取彻底胜利的时候，越南民主共和国政府和北方人民赠给南方军民一批礼物，南方全体军民对骨肉的北方人民的这种爱护和关怀无比感激。
    信中指出，南方军民新春取得的巨大胜利，使美伪集团深深地陷于无法自拔的窘境。敌人正在进行垂死挣扎，他们派遣飞机和使用大炮，残暴地轰击许多居民稠密区，杀害了数以千计的人民，企图以此来动摇越南南方人民战斗和胜利的决心。但是美帝国主义及其走狗的滔天罪行，只能激起南方人民更大的仇恨，使南方人民更加坚决地战斗，彻底打败美帝国主义，推翻卖国傀儡政权。
    信中说，在当前战斗非常紧张和激烈的时刻，南方人民心向北方，心向胡志明主席，保证在任何情况下，不管要经受多大的艰苦和付出多大的牺牲，永远一片丹心，坚决同北方人民一起，彻底打败美帝国主义，完成民族赋予的任务和自己的国际义务。
