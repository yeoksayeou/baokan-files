Syrian Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Ibrahim Makhous denounces U.S. imperialism's support for Israel's aggression against Arab countries and points out that the Arab people can only gain liberation through armed struggle.

According to a report by the Syrian newspaper *Al-Ba'ath* on the 14th, Makhous stated on the 12th during a meeting with several foreign press delegations that, "Just as political struggle cannot replace the people's war of resistance against American aggression in Vietnam, political action cannot replace the armed struggle of the Arab masses."

He emphasized, "No country has been liberated without the struggle of its people."

Makhous cited facts to strongly illustrate that the United Nations organization cannot represent the interests of oppressed nations. He said, "When I first participated in the activities of the United Nations, I had said that unless aggression is condemned, there can be no question of justice. I thought that when the member states of the United Nations knew the actual situation—that the occupied territories belong to three member states (referring to Egypt, Syria, and Jordan)—then, even without any discussion, we would immediately condemn it together. However, the result was completely different. Even a theoretical condemnation of aggression was not possible." He went on to stress, "Obviously, the United States directed the battles that took place here and also directed the battles that took place at the United Nations."

It is known that in late November of last year, the United Nations Security Council, under the manipulation of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, passed a resolution on the Middle East issue. Not only did it not condemn the aggression of the U.S. and Israel against Arab countries, but it also attempted to force Arab countries to surrender to the aggressors. This criminal act was met with resistance and condemnation from the broad masses of the Arab people.

### 叙利亚副总理谴责美帝支持以色列侵略阿拉伯国家　阿拉伯人民只有通过武装斗争才能获得解放

　　叙利亚副总理谴责美帝支持以色列侵略阿拉伯国家
　　阿拉伯人民只有通过武装斗争才能获得解放
    新华社大马士革电  叙利亚副总理兼外交部长易卜拉欣·马胡斯谴责美帝国主义支持以色列侵略阿拉伯国家，并指出阿拉伯人民只有通过武装斗争才能获得解放。
    据叙利亚《复兴报》十四日报道，马胡斯于十二日在这里接见几个外国报界代表团时说，正如不能用政治斗争来代替越南人民正在进行的抗美救国战争一样，“政治行动不能代替阿拉伯群众被迫进行的人民武装斗争”。他指出：“已经获得解放的国家没有不是经过人民斗争的。”
    马胡斯列举事实，有力地说明联合国这个组织根本不可能代表被压迫民族的利益。他说：“当我第一次参加联合国的活动时，我当时曾经说过，除非侵略受到谴责，否则事情就谈不上什么道义。我想，当联合国成员国知道了实际情况，那就是被占领的是属于三个成员国（按指阿联、叙利亚和约旦）的领土时，那末，我们即使不经过任何讨论，也会立即共同加以谴责。然而，结果完全不同。甚至连在理论上谴责一下侵略也办不到。”他接着强调指出：“显然，美国在侵略过程中指挥了发生在这里的战斗，同时也指挥了发生在联合国那里的战斗。”
    大家知道，去年十一月底，联合国安全理事会在美苏操纵下曾就中东问题通过一项提案，不仅没有谴责美、以对阿拉伯国家的侵略，反而企图压迫阿拉伯国家向侵略者投降。这一罪恶行径，遭到了阿拉伯国家广大人民的抵制和谴责。
