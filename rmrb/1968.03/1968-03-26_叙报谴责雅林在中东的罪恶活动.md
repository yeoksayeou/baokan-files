Syrian newspapers *Al-Thawra* and *Al-Ba'ath* both published editorials on the 12th, condemning the United Nations "envoy" Yariv for acting on behalf of American imperialism. Yariv has repeatedly traveled to the Middle East, promoting a proposal passed by the UN Security Council at the end of November last year under the manipulation of the US and the Soviet Union. This proposal aims to force the Arab people to surrender to the United States and Israeli aggressors.

The editorials also point out that the only path for the Arab people to liberate their homeland is through armed struggle.

    叙报谴责雅林在中东的罪恶活动
    叙利亚《革命报》和《复兴报》分别在十二日发表社论，谴责联合国“特使”雅林秉承美帝国主义的意旨，一再到中东奔走，兜售去年十一月底在美苏操纵下联合国安理会通过的一项提案，妄图迫使阿拉伯人民向美国和以色列侵略者投降。
    社论并且指出，阿拉伯人民解放自己国土的唯一道路是进行武装斗争。
