	The spokesperson for the Lao People's Liberation Army General Command issued a statement on March 22, strongly protesting the barbaric airstrikes by U.S. imperialist warplanes on Sam Neua city. The statement said that on March 17, more than 40 sorties of U.S. aircraft bombed and strafed Sam Neua city, causing significant losses to the people's lives and property.

	The statement emphasized that the U.S. imperialists' barbaric bombing of Sam Neua city will not shake the fighting will of the Lao people. It can only prompt the Lao people to strengthen their struggle and launch more powerful counterattacks against the enemy, making them suffer even more severe defeats.

	The statement finally called on the Lao patriotic military and people to concentrate their hatred on the gun barrels and bayonets, charge forward, launch fierce attacks on the enemy, shoot down more U.S. aggressor planes, and annihilate more enemy combatants.

    强烈抗议美机野蛮轰炸桑怒罪行
    新华社康开二十七日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝人民解放军最高指挥部发言人二十二日发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义出动强盗飞机野蛮轰炸桑怒市的罪行。声明说，三月十七日，四十多架次美国飞机轰炸、扫射桑怒市，给人民的生命和财产造成许多损失。
    声明强调说，美帝国主义对桑怒市进行野蛮轰炸，也绝对动摇不了老挝人民的战斗意志。它只能促使老挝人民加强斗争，更猛烈地反击敌人，使它们遭受更加惨重的失败。
    声明最后号召老挝爱国军民要把仇恨凝集在枪口和刺刀上，冲上前去，猛烈进攻敌人，击落更多的美国强盗飞机，消灭更多的敌人有生力量。
