In the midst of the nationwide struggle of hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mudanjiang City recently held its first conference of representatives who actively study Chairman Mao's works.

During the conference, over 800 representatives and attendees left the meeting venue and went to more than 100 units. Together with the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams and the city's three-in-one revolutionary committees' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, they spread Mao Zedong Thought among the masses and used it to solve the most important practical problems in those places. This action inspired the revolutionary masses of Mudanjiang City to launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, effectively promoting and consolidating the city's revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

The representatives went to some places where revolutionary great alliances had not yet been achieved. In some units, the two factions or multiple factions were in opposition, arguing endlessly. In these places, spreading and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions to promote the Cultural Revolution encountered many difficulties. However, the majority of the representatives dared to face these difficulties head-on. They said: "This is the touchstone for measuring how high we hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, the great arena for testing our active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and the best opportunity to temper our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao." Over 800 revolutionary pioneers, with hearts full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, threw themselves into this arena of class struggle.

The representatives had originally prepared a set of speeches, but when they encountered practical problems, reciting the speeches did not work. They simply discarded the speeches and, based on the actual struggles and living thoughts of the masses in the units they visited, prescribed remedies to share their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a particular aspect.

Two representatives from Mudanjiang Forestry School, Li Zhiyuan and Li Bingkun, were originally leaders of two opposing organizations. They had recently engaged in intense "internal warfare." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the two factions resolved their ideological knots and achieved revolutionary great alliance. Their experience of uniting was exactly what the units that had not yet united needed. The two of them tirelessly went from place to place to share their experiences. They spoke well, and many units invited them, with the masses eager to listen. Once, they went to a factory where the "internal warfare" was intense. Initially, some workers were unwilling to listen, so the two of them found a few dozen people and started speaking in the clubhouse. Their vivid examples of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought attracted the revolutionary workers of the factory. Initially, a few dozen people listened, then a few hundred, until the clubhouse, which could hold over a thousand people, was full. Some people stood by the poles and listened through the loudspeakers. Everyone listened and discussed: They truly act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. If we continue to cling to bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, how can we be loyal to Chairman Mao?

Some representatives went to a unit where the emotions of the two factions were quite intense to spread Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After the representatives did painstaking and detailed ideological work there, the masses of various factions said: "We originally had no fundamental conflicts of interest. Chairman Mao's latest instructions truly speak to our hearts! We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and quickly achieve revolutionary great alliance." However, some leaders, due to their heavy bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, failed to reach an agreement in their negotiations, frustrating the masses. Many masses found the representatives and said: "If the leaders don't unite, just kick them out!"

Is kicking out the leaders the right approach? Some representatives thought it was right, while others thought it was wrong, and the two opinions could not be reconciled. Everyone reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "The attitude of Communist Party members towards backward people is not to despise them, look down on them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." Chairman Mao's great teachings immediately opened two windows in people's hearts. They acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and the problem was successfully resolved.

    在阶级斗争中检验活学活用毛泽东思想的成绩
    牡丹江市学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表到群众中去，帮助解决文化大革命中的实际问题，效果良好
    据《黑龙江日报》报道：在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大进军中，牡丹江市最近召开了第一次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。
    会议期间，八百多名代表和列席代表，走出会场，分赴一百多个单位，和人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队、市三代会毛泽东思想宣传队一起，向广大群众大讲毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想解决那里最重要的实际问题。他们这一行动，带动牡丹江市广大革命群众掀起了活学活用毛主席最新指示的新高潮，有力地促进和巩固了全市的革命大联合和革命三结合。
    代表们来到一些还没有实现革命大联合的地方。有的单位，两大派、几大派相互对立，争吵不休。在这些地方宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示，推动那里的文化大革命运动，遇到了不少困难。但是，绝大部分代表敢于迎着困难上。他们说：“这是衡量我们毛泽东思想红旗举得高不高的试金石，是检验我们活学活用毛泽东思想的大考场，是锻炼我们无限忠于毛主席的最好机会。”八百多名革命闯将，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心，投入了这场阶级斗争的大考场。
    代表们原来都准备好了一套讲稿，但是遇到实际问题，念讲稿行不通。他们干脆抛开了讲稿，针对所在单位的斗争实际和群众的活思想，对症下药地讲述自己在某个方面活学活用毛主席最新指示的体会。
    牡丹江林业学校的两位代表李植元和李冰坤，原来是两个对立组织的头头。他们不久前还大打“内战”。在毛主席最新指示的教导下，两派解开了思想疙瘩，实现了革命大联合。他们联合起来的经验，正是那些还没有联合的单位所需要的。他俩总是不辞劳苦地一个地方一个地方地去做介绍。他俩讲得好，许多单位争着请，群众抢着听。有一次，他俩到一个“内战”激烈的工厂去讲，开始有些职工不愿听，他俩就自己找了几十个人，在俱乐部里讲开了。他们活学活用毛泽东思想的生动事迹，吸引了这个厂的革命职工，开始几十个人听，后来几百人听，直到可容一千多人的俱乐部容纳不下，有的人站在电杆旁边从喇叭里听。大家一边听，一边议论：人家真是按毛主席指示办事。我们再死抱资产阶级、小资产阶级派性不放，怎么能算忠于毛主席？
    有一部分代表，到一个两派对立情绪较大的单位去宣传毛主席的最新指示。经过代表们在那里进行了一番艰苦细致的思想工作，各派群众都说：我们之间本来没有根本的利害冲突，毛主席的最新指示真说到我们心坎上啦！我们一定要听毛主席的话，尽快实现革命的大联合。可是，有些头头由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性较重，双方谈判一时没有达成协议，急得群众冒火。不少群众找代表们说：头头不联合，干脆把他们踢开算了！
    把头头踢开，这种做法对不对？有的代表认为对，有的代表认为不对，两种意见争持不下。大家重温了毛主席的教导。毛主席说：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”毛主席的伟大教导，使人们心里立刻开了两扇窗。他们按照毛主席的教导去做了，结果圆满地解决了问题。
