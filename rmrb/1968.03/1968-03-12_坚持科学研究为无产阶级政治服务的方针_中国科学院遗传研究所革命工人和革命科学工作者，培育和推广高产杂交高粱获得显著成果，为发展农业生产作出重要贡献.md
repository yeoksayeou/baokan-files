The revolutionary workers and scientific workers of the Institute of Genetics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, have achieved remarkable results in the cultivation and promotion of high-yield hybrid sorghum, making important contributions to the development of agricultural production.

New China News Agency, March 11th: The revolutionary workers and scientific workers of the Institute of Genetics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implemented the great policy of serving proletarian politics and socialist construction with scientific research, closely united with the peasant masses, and vigorously cultivated and promoted high-yield hybrid sorghum, achieving remarkable results. They are now expanding the promotion.

Hybrid sorghum is obtained by hybridizing male-sterile sorghum with ordinary sorghum. The hybrid vigor is very significant. In recent years, especially during the turbulent years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1966 and 1967, hybrid sorghum has been promoted in vast areas of Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Anhui and other provinces and autonomous regions. The planting area has reached several million mu. The planting situation in various places shows that hybrid sorghum not only has excellent characteristics such as drought resistance, waterlogging resistance, salt-alkali resistance, and adaptability to poor soils, but more importantly, it has achieved large-scale increases in yield. Hybrid sorghum generally increases yield by 30% to 40% compared to local varieties, and in some cases, the yield even doubles. Now, many places have broken through the yield of 1,000 jin per mu by planting hybrid sorghum on a large scale. Therefore, it has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in various places. They praise hybrid sorghum as the "northern rice" and the "treasure of saline-alkali land."

Sorghum is one of the main grains in the vast areas of Northeast China and North China, and it is an important raw material for brewing, starch production, and sugar making in industry. It is planted in both the south and the north of China. The promotion of hybrid sorghum is of great significance for changing the low-yield situation in the vast areas of the Yellow River, Huai River, and Hai River basins, implementing the great strategic plan of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao, and achieving the "Outline for Agricultural Development."

As early as the Great Leap Forward in 1958, revolutionary scientific workers followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao on self-reliance and striving for progress, and began to cultivate hybrid sorghum. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the scientific and technological circles crazily promoted the revisionist scientific research line, advocating "pure theory" research that is detached from politics, detached from the masses, and detached from production. They opposed the combination of revolutionary scientific workers and workers and peasants, and cut down scientific research projects such as hybrid sorghum that serve socialist construction, attempting to strangle this new thing, making it impossible for hybrid sorghum to be rapidly promoted on a large scale.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly inspired revolutionary scientific workers and vigorously promoted the work of promoting hybrid sorghum. The revolutionary cadres of the Institute of Genetics, who participated in the scientific experiments and promotion of hybrid sorghum, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, went to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and conducted scientific experiments and promotion of hybrid sorghum with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They took class struggle as the key link, used Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" as weapons, followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "practice, knowledge, more practice, more knowledge," conducted investigations and research in various people's communes and production teams, learned and summarized the advanced technology and experience of planting hybrid sorghum by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, promoted and popularized these advanced technologies and experiences, and helped the local broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to cultivate and train batch after batch of technical backbone teams for planting hybrid sorghum, making great contributions to the development of local agricultural production. The revolutionary cadres of the Institute of Genetics, in the process of promoting hybrid sorghum, also worked closely with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, ate, lived, and worked together, studied and applied the "Three Articles" together, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, humbly learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants, broke down selfishness, and established public spirit, transformed their world outlook, promoted the revolutionization of their thoughts, and achieved a double harvest in thought and scientific research.

　　坚持科学研究为无产阶级政治服务的方针
    中国科学院遗传研究所革命工人和革命科学工作者，培育和推广高产杂交高粱获得显著成果，为发展农业生产作出重要贡献
    新华社十一日讯　中国科学院遗传研究所的革命工人和革命科学工作者，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻科学研究为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义建设服务的伟大方针，和农民群众密切结合，大力培育和推广高产的杂交高粱，获得了显著成果，现在正在扩大推广。
    杂交高粱，是利用雄性不育系高粱和普通高粱，进行杂交获得的杂交种。杂交种优势非常显著。几年来，特别是在无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈进行的一九六六年和一九六七年，杂交高粱在我国山东、山西、河北、河南、辽宁、内蒙古、陕西、安徽等省和自治区广大地区推广，种植面积达几百万亩。各地种植情况表明：杂交高粱不仅具有抗旱，耐涝，耐盐碱，耐瘠薄，适应性强等优良特性，更可喜的是普遍获得大面积增产。杂交高粱比当地品种一般增产百分之三十到百分之四十，高的甚至成倍增产。现在很多地方在大面积上种植杂交高粱，已经闯过亩产千斤关。因此，受到各地广大贫下中农的热烈欢迎。他们称赞杂交高粱是“北方水稻”、“碱地的宝贝”。
    高粱是我国东北和华北等广大地区的主要粮食之一，在工业上是酿酒、制淀粉和制糖的重要原料，在我国的南方和北方都有种植。杂交高粱的推广，对改变我国黄河、淮河、海河流域广大地区的低产面貌，为实现伟大领袖毛主席提出的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，实现“农业发展纲要”，具有极为重要的意义。
    早在大跃进的一九五八年，革命的科学工作者就遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于自力更生、奋发图强的教导，开始培育杂交高粱。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在科技界的代理人疯狂推行反革命修正主义的科研路线，他们大肆鼓吹脱离政治，脱离群众，脱离生产的“纯理论”研究，反对革命的科学工作者和工农群众相结合，大砍象杂交高粱这样的为社会主义建设服务的科学研究项目，妄图扼杀这一新生事物，使杂交高粱不能迅速地大面积地推广。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，极大地鼓舞了革命的科学工作者，有力地推动了杂交高粱的推广工作。参加杂交高粱科学实验和推广工作的遗传研究所的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，到贫下中农中去，和贫下中农一起进行杂交高粱的科学实验和推广工作。他们以阶级斗争为纲，以毛主席的光辉著作《实践论》和《矛盾论》为武器，遵循毛主席关于“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”的教导，到各地人民公社、生产队调查研究，学习和总结广大贫下中农种植杂交高粱的先进技术和经验，宣传推广这些先进技术和经验，并帮助当地广大贫下中农培养和训练了一批又一批种植杂交高粱的技术骨干队伍，为发展当地的农业生产作出了很大贡献。遗传研究所的无产阶级革命派，在推广杂交高粱的过程中，还处处和广大贫下中农打成一片，和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，一起大学大用“老三篇”，一起斗私批修，虚心向贫下中农学习，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，改造世界观，促进思想革命化，取得了思想和科学研究双丰收。
