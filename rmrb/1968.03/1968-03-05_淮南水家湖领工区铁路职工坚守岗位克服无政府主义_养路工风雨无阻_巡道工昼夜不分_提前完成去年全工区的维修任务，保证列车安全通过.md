	“Follow Chairman Mao’s words, seize the revolution and promote production, guard the production posts, and ensure the smooth operation of the railways at all times!” This is the oath taken by all the railway workers of the Huainan Shuijiahu Section. The facts have proven that they not only say it, but they do it as well. From last September to now, the entire section of over forty people has not had a single person absent from work without reason for even a single day. They not only adhere to the eight-hour workday, but also, when work is needed, they go out at any time, day or night, and fight on the railway lines. They not only completed the 1967 maintenance tasks for the entire section ten days ahead of schedule, but the quality is also excellent. During this period, there have been no work-related injuries or train operation failures.

	Before last September, the more than forty people in this section were divided into two opposing factions. The two sides argued endlessly, disrupting the direction of the struggle, and anarchist tendencies spread, with many people leaving their production posts, causing losses to the state.

	Both factions of workers were dissatisfied with this situation. At this time, the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao came down, like a beacon lighting up the hearts of the railway workers. “Who wants us to split up except the class enemies?” The workers raised the same call: “Unite! Unite!”

	The working class says what it does. The two factions, with the spirit of “seizing the day,” quickly achieved revolutionary unity, and immediately held a meeting to criticize and repudiate revisionism and a meeting to promote production, putting Chairman Mao’s latest instructions into practice.

	They united within their own ranks, but interference often came from outside. One day in November last year, the Shuijiahu Section received a phone call from a place seventy miles away. This call was made by a mass organization from another unit, inviting them to attend a meeting convened unilaterally by this mass organization. In the past, they had gone to other units to attend similar meetings. But should they go this time? At this moment, they heard Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, realizing that attending such a meeting would not be beneficial to the revolutionary unity, so they resolutely replied to the other side: “We have already united. We will not attend meetings convened unilaterally by you.” From then on, they disengaged from the activities of other units, resisted external interference, and adhered to the policy of revolutionizing on the spot and in their spare time.

	The workers of this section, in defending Chairman Mao’s great line of “seizing the revolution and promoting production,” have always guarded their production posts. Day-shift workers have to walk thirty miles for each shift, and night-shift workers have to walk forty miles, but they never complain of fatigue. They say: “For the revolution, guarding the production posts, the harder the work, the happier we are!”

	One day in October last year, the 101st switch on the line from Shuijiahu to Bengbu was bent due to over-reversal. It was already midnight, and the track maintenance workers were asleep. After foreman Jiang Guitang heard the news, he thought of Chairman Mao’s teachings about “our army is completely for the liberation of the people, working thoroughly for the people’s interests,” and without hesitation, got out of bed and led a few workers to rush to the 101st switch, repairing the bent rail in time and ensuring safe train operation. They said: “We, the working class, must act according to Chairman Mao’s teachings, constantly struggle against selfishness, and uphold the public interest, forever ensuring the smooth operation of the railways.”

	Since this year, all the workers of the Shuijiahu Section, with the help of the People’s Liberation Army, have adhered to the principle of producing during the day and revolutionizing at night, holding extensive classes to study Chairman Mao’s thoughts. They not only eliminated absenteeism but also ensured that “track maintenance workers work regardless of weather, and patrol workers work day and night,” guaranteeing the safe passage of trains through their section and onward to all parts of the country!

    淮南水家湖领工区铁路职工坚守岗位克服无政府主义
    养路工风雨无阻  巡道工昼夜不分
    提前完成去年全工区的维修任务，保证列车安全通过
    本报讯　“听毛主席的话，抓革命、促生产，坚守生产岗位，时刻保证铁路畅通！”这是安徽淮南铁路水家湖领工区全体铁路工人立下的誓言。事实证明，他们不仅说得到，也做得到。从去年九月到现在，全工区四十多人，没有一个人、一天无故不上工。他们不仅坚持了八小时工作制，而且在工作需要时，不管白天黑夜，随时出动，战斗在铁路线上。他们不仅提前十天完成了一九六七年全工区的维修任务，而且质量优良。在这段时间内，没有发生过一次工伤事故、一次列车通行故障。
    在去年九月以前，这个工区的四十多人，也分为势不两立的两大派组织。两派之间争论不休，干扰了斗争的大方向，无政府主义思潮泛滥，不少人离开了生产岗位，给国家造成了损失。
    两派工人对这种情况都不满意。就在这时，伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示下来了，象一盏明灯照亮了铁路工人的心。“除了阶级敌人，谁希望我们分裂呢？”工人们发出了同一个呼声：“联合起来！联合起来！”
    工人阶级说到做到。两大派以“只争朝夕”的精神，迅速实现了革命的大联合，并且紧接着开了斗私批修大会和抓革命、促生产的跃进会，以实际行动落实毛主席的最新指示。
    自己内部联合起来了，可是干扰还常常从外面袭来。去年十一月的一天，水家湖领工区接到七十里外一个地方来的一个电话。这个电话是另一单位的一个群众组织打来的，要他们去参加这个群众组织单方面召开的一个会议。过去，他们曾经到外单位去参加过类似的会议。可是现在还去不去呢？这时，他们耳边响起了毛主席的最新指示，认识到参加这种会对革命大联合没有好处，于是斩钉截铁地回答对方：“我们已经联合起来了，你们单方面召开的会，我们不参加。”从此，他们同外单位的活动脱了钩，抵制了外来的干扰，坚持了就地闹革命、业余闹革命的方针。
    这个工区的工人，在捍卫毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中，一直坚守生产岗位。白班工人每班工作要走三十里路，夜班工人要走四十里路，但他们从不说累。他们说：“为革命坚守生产岗位，越累越幸福！”
    去年十月的一天，由水家湖往蚌埠方向去的101号道岔，由于倒车过猛把钢轨挤弯了一节。这时已是半夜，养路工都睡觉了。工长蒋桂堂得知这个消息以后，想起毛主席关于“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”的教导，毫不犹豫地从床上爬起来，带领几个工人直奔101号道岔，及时抢修好了弯轨，保证了安全行车。他们说：“我们工人阶级就是要按照毛主席的教导办事，时时狠斗私心，大立‘公’字，永远保持铁路畅通无阻”。
    今年以来，水家湖领工区的全体工人，在解放军的帮助下，坚持白天搞生产，晚上抓革命，大办毛泽东思想学习班。他们不仅消灭了旷工现象，而且做到了“养路工风雨无阻，巡道工昼夜不分”，保证了列车安全地通过本工区，奔向祖国的四面八方！
