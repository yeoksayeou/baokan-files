The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam, in the earth-shaking Tet Offensive, have unleashed a storm of revolutionary struggle in enemy-occupied rural areas, sweeping away the U.S. puppet "pacification" plan, and thoroughly smashing the "pacification of the countryside" scheme of the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys. They have liberated vast tracts of land and millions of people.

In just a few dozen days, from the foothills of the Truong Son Mountains to the banks of the Mekong River, a violent storm of peasant revolution swept forward. Millions of peasants, rising up in revolt, joined the People's Liberation Armed Forces in destroying enemy strongholds, demolishing "strategic hamlets," smashing the U.S. puppet administrative organs, eliminating the "pacification work teams" of the U.S. puppet clique, and capturing the notorious traitors and collaborators. The lower-level administrative organs of the Saigon puppet regime quickly collapsed, and the dark "pacification zones" in the countryside saw the light of day, becoming the people's territory. The military and civilian people around Hue not only annihilated a large number of U.S. puppet troops but also eliminated all of the enemy's "pacification work teams" and 169 platoons of the Self-Defense Corps, overthrowing a large number of puppet military and political organs from the provincial to the village level, liberating 400,000 people. The military and civilian people of Quang Ngai Province destroyed many of the enemy's "strategic hamlets" and resettlement areas, liberating 90,000 people in the first 20 days of the Tet Offensive. The Mekong Delta, where the U.S. puppet clique focused on implementing the "pacification plan," saw the emergence of large new liberated areas. In just one month, in the seven provinces of the Southwestern Region, including Ba Ria, Di An, and Tay Ninh, more than 200 communes and villages with a population of 500,000 were liberated. Especially in the "pacification showcase" of My Tho, the broad masses of military and civilian people smashed the U.S. puppet administrative organs in the countryside to pieces.

Under the powerful blows of revolutionary violence from millions of awakened masses, the U.S. puppet clique's "pacification of the countryside" plan has been thoroughly defeated. U.S. puppet troops are heavily besieged in isolated cities and bases. These cities and bases have become isolated islands in the vast ocean of people's war. An American reporter, with a frustrated heart, complained about the ineffectiveness of the U.S. puppet troops and the South Vietnamese puppet regime, frequently lamenting, "The hard-won results of the pacification plan in the 16 provinces of the Mekong Delta have been lost," the puppet regime has "fallen into a state of paralysis," and the U.S. puppet troops "a large part are tied down in cities," while the People's Liberation Armed Forces "almost freely roam the countryside."

As early as 30 years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his brilliant work "On Protracted War": "Mobilizing the entire population creates an ocean that drowns the enemy." The great revolutionary practice of the South Vietnamese people has once again proven this brilliant judgment. Today, U.S. imperialism has fallen into the vast ocean of people's war in South Vietnam, facing annihilation. Under the thunderous blows of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam, the puppet regime of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky has seen its administrative organs in the countryside largely destroyed by the people's revolutionary storm. In just 30 days, regions with a population of 1.2 million have been liberated. The military and civilian people of South Vietnam have thoroughly defeated the U.S. puppet clique's "pacification of the countryside" plan, turning increasingly vast rural areas into new territories for the people. The vast liberated rural areas are connected in large patches, stretching from the Central Highlands to the Quảng Trị-Thừa Thiên and the central coastal plains, from the mountains of the Southeastern Region to the outskirts of Saigon and the vast Mekong Delta. The South Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation rural base is increasingly consolidated, with human and material resources continuously strengthened.

The U.S. puppet clique's attempt to "pacify the countryside" to protect cities and bases and "win the hearts and minds" of the people has completely failed. Western news agencies and newspapers admit that the so-called "myth" of establishing "pacification zones" has been thoroughly shattered. An American reporter lamented, "In fact, South Vietnam (referring to the Saigon puppet regime) has abandoned its own countryside. The extremely important pacification plan, if not completely ruined, is in a state of stagnation." The U.S. ambassador to Saigon, Bunker, had to grudgingly admit that the "pacification efforts" of the U.S. puppet clique have "temporarily stalled."

The military and civilian people of South Vietnam, after arduous and unyielding struggles, have created an unprecedentedly favorable situation, defeating the U.S. puppet clique's series of strategic intentions to annihilate the main force of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, stabilize the countryside, and consolidate the puppet army, completely disrupting the U.S. imperialists' deployment, and putting the U.S. in an even more passive and defensive position. The U.S. aggressors have suffered heavy defeats both strategically and tactically and cannot escape the fate of ultimate failure. As our great leader Chairman Mao foresaw, "The days of the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam are numbered." The heroic people of South Vietnam, overcoming all difficulties, will persist in protracted warfare and ultimately drive the U.S. aggressors out of their homeland, planting the flag of victory across all of South Vietnam.

The thunderous cannon fire of the South Vietnamese military and civilian people's anti-American, national salvation struggle shakes the vast land of South Vietnam, defeating the U.S. aggressors and the South Vietnamese puppet army.

　　让敌占农村变成人民的天下  把侵略者淹没在人民战争汪洋大海中
　　南越新春攻势把美伪“绥靖计划”砸得粉碎
　　千百万敌占区农民揭竿而起配合解放武装力量捣毁“战略村”消灭伪政权解放广大农村
    据新华社十九日讯　本社记者报道：英雄的越南南方军民在震撼世界的新春攻势中，在敌占农村掀起了势如破竹的革命斗争风暴，横扫美伪军和伪政权，彻底粉碎美国侵略者及其走狗的“绥靖农村”计划，解放了大片土地和数以百万计的人民。
    在几十天中，从长山山麓到湄公河畔，势如暴风骤雨的农民革命浪潮滚滚向前。千百万揭竿而起的农民，配合人民解放武装力量摧毁敌人的据点，捣毁“战略村”，砸烂美伪的统治机构，消灭美伪集团的“绥靖工作小组”，追捕作恶多端的恶棍、越奸。西贡傀儡政权的大批基层统治机构迅速土崩瓦解，暗无天日的农村“绥靖区”重见光明，成了人民的天下。顺化周围地区军民，不仅歼灭了美伪军的大量有生力量，而且消灭了敌人的所有的“绥靖工作小组”和民卫队一百六十九个排，推翻了从省到村的大批伪军政机构，使四十万人民获得解放。广义省军民捣毁了敌人的许多“战略村”和居民集中区，在新春攻势的头二十天中就解放了九万人民。美伪集团重点推行“绥靖计划”的湄公河三角洲，更是出现了大片的新解放区。仅在南部西区薄寮、迪石、芹苴等七个省中，在一个月内就有包括五十万人口的二百多个乡和村获得解放。特别是被美伪集团视为“绥靖橱窗”的金瓯，广大军民更把在乡村里的美伪统治机构砸得稀巴烂。
    在千百万已经觉醒的群众的革命暴力强大打击下，美伪集团“绥靖农村”的计划遭到彻底破产，美伪军被重重围困在一些孤立的城镇和基地里。这些城镇和基地已成为人民战争汪洋大海中的孤岛。一个美国记者以懊丧的心情埋怨美伪军和南越傀儡集团不中用，他频频哀叹，“三角洲十六个省份中实行绥靖计划所取的来得不易的成果已经丧失了”，傀儡政权已“陷于瘫痪状态”，美伪军“很大一部分被牵制在城镇中”，而人民解放武装力量“几乎是在乡村里任意来往”。
    早在三十年前，我们的伟大领袖毛主席在他的光辉著作《论持久战》中已经指出：“动员了全国的老百姓，就造成了陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海”。南越人民的伟大革命实践，又一次证明了这一英明论断。今天，美帝国主义已经陷入了越南南方人民战争的汪洋大海之中，面临灭顶之灾。在越南南方军民雷霆万钧般的打击下，阮文绍—阮高其卖国集团在乡村的大部分统治机构已经被人民的革命风暴所摧毁。仅在三十天内，就有一百二十万人口的地区获得了解放。南越军民彻底挫败了美伪集团“绥靖农村”的计划，把越来越广阔的农村地区变成了人民的新天地。广阔的农村解放区连成大片，从西原山区伸展到广治—承天和中部沿海平原，从南部东区的山林伸展到西贡周围和辽阔的湄公河三角洲。越南南方人民抗美救国的广阔农村根据地日益巩固，人力物力基础不断加强。
    美伪集团妄图通过“绥靖农村”以保护城镇、基地的安全和“争取民心”的幻梦，已经彻底破灭。西方通讯社和报刊承认，美国吹嘘的所谓建立“绥靖区”的“神话”，已经彻底破产。一个美国记者叹道：“实际上，南越（指西贡傀儡政权）已经放弃了它自己的乡村。极其重要的绥靖计划，如果不是完蛋了，就是陷于停顿状态。”美国驻西贡“大使”邦克也不得不灰溜溜地承认，美伪集团的“绥靖努力已暂时停顿下来。”
    越南南方军民经过艰苦卓绝的战斗，打出了空前大好的形势，挫败了美伪集团妄图消灭人民解放武装主力、稳定农村、巩固伪军等一系列战略意图，完全打乱了美帝的侵略部署，使美帝陷入更加被动挨打的困境。美国侵略者在战略上、战术上，都遭到了惨重的失败，无法逃脱最后失败的命运。正如伟大领袖毛主席英明预见的：“美国侵略者在越南的日子不长了。”英雄的越南南方人民排除万难，坚持持久作战，最后必定能够把美国侵略强盗赶出自己的国土，把胜利的红旗插遍整个越南南方。（附图片）
