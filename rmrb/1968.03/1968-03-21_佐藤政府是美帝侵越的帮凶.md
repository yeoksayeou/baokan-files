The U.S. imperialists, in their war of aggression against Vietnam, have been beaten black and blue by the Vietnamese people, and are now at their wits' end. They are desperately seeking accomplices and lackeys to serve their war of aggression. The Sato government of Japan is a major accomplice of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and a vicious enemy of the Vietnamese people.

The Sato reactionary government, which has always followed the U.S. imperialists in pursuing a policy of aggression and war, now tries to present itself as having nothing to do with the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, claiming that it "hopes for a just and lasting peace in Vietnam." This is sheer hypocrisy. In fact, the Sato government of Japan has long been participating in the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, committing heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people. Politically, the Sato government has been vigorously supporting the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, openly declaring: "Japan, as a member of the free world, stands on the same side as the United States," urging the U.S. to "hold out in South Vietnam" and to continue bombing North Vietnam. Militarily, the Sato government has been steadily turning Japan into a direct military base for the U.S. aggression against Vietnam. It has allowed U.S. aircraft and warships involved in the aggression against Vietnam to freely use bases and ports on Japanese territory, even permitting U.S. nuclear aircraft carriers engaged in the Vietnam War to enter Japanese ports. It has also directly provided the U.S. with manpower, military ships, weapons, ammunition, napalm, chemical poisons, and other military supplies, helping the U.S. aggressors to slaughter the Vietnamese people. Now, it is blatantly allowing large numbers of U.S. B-52 bombers to be stationed on the Japanese territory of Okinawa, in defiance of the strong opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people. The Sato government has tightly tied Japan to the U.S. war chariot of aggression against Vietnam.

The Sato government hopes to expand its sphere of influence in Asia by supporting the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, in order to revive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." However, the Sato government's dream is doomed to fail. The U.S. imperialists have mobilized more than 500,000 U.S. aggressor troops, yet they have been beaten to a pulp by the Vietnamese people, losing face and suffering heavy losses, and are on the verge of being swallowed up by the Vietnamese people's war. Can Japanese militarism reap any benefits from the Vietnam War? The heroic Vietnamese people and the people of Asia know how to teach the U.S. imperialists and all their accomplices and lackeys a lesson.

Today, the workers, peasants, patriotic students, and other progressive forces in Japan, as well as the revolutionary left, are uniting to fight against U.S. military bases, against the stationing of U.S. B-52 bombers in Okinawa, against the entry of U.S. nuclear warships into Japanese ports, against the construction of U.S. field hospitals, and for the recovery of Okinawa and the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The Japanese people's anti-U.S. struggle is a powerful support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The awakened Japanese people will never allow the Sato clique to turn Japan into a breeding ground for U.S. imperialist wars of aggression in Asia.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "If the U.S. monopolistic capitalist clique insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably be hanged by the people of the whole world one day. The same will be true of other U.S. accomplices." "Those who are determined to be led by the nose by U.S. imperialism will end up as sacrifices for U.S. imperialism!" If the Japanese reactionaries persist in their delusions and follow the U.S. imperialists down the road of aggression and adventure, they will end up as sacrifices for U.S. imperialism!

    佐藤政府是美帝侵越的帮凶
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中，被越南人民打得焦头烂额，走投无路。它极力搜罗帮凶和走卒，来为它的侵略战争效劳。日本佐藤政府就是美帝国主义侵略越南的一个主要帮凶，是越南人民的凶恶的敌人。
    一贯追随美帝国主义推行侵略和战争政策的佐藤反动政府，竟然把自己打扮成同美帝国主义侵略越南无关的样子，说什么“希望在越南早日实现公正的持久和平”。这完全是无耻的谰言。事实上，日本佐藤政府早已参加了美国侵略越南的战争，对越南人民犯下了滔天罪行。在政治上，佐藤政府竭力支持美国侵略越南，公开叫嚷：“日本作为自由阵营的一员，同美国站在一样的立场上”，要美帝“在南越顶住”，在越南北方继续轰炸。在军事上，佐藤政府更步步加紧地把日本变为美国侵略越南的直接的军事基地。它让美国侵略越南的飞机和军舰自由地使用日本领土上的基地和港口，甚至允许在越南作战的美国核航空母舰开进日本港口。它还直接向美国提供人力、军用船只、武器、弹药、凝固汽油弹、化学毒药和其他许多军需物资，帮助美国侵略军屠杀越南人民。现在，它更不顾日本广大人民的强烈反对，公然让美国的大批B—52型轰炸机进驻日本的领土冲绳岛。佐藤政府已把日本紧紧地拴在美帝侵略越南的战车上了。
    佐藤政府妄图通过支持美帝侵略越南，来扩张它在亚洲的势力范围，以便重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。但是，佐藤政府的迷梦是注定要破灭的。美帝国主义调动了五十多万美国侵略军，尚且被越南人民打得鼻青脸肿，丢盔弃甲，在越南人民战争的汪洋大海中快要灭顶了，难道日本军国主义还能从侵越战争中捞到什么便宜吗？英雄的越南人民和亚洲人民是懂得怎样教训美帝国主义及其一切帮凶和走卒的。
    今天，日本的工人、农民、爱国学生及其他进步力量、日本的革命左派，正在团结起来，为反对美国军事基地、反对美国B—52型轰炸机进驻冲绳、反对美国核舰艇开进日本港口、反对修建美军野战医院，为收回冲绳和废除日美“安全条约”，进行着坚韧不拔的斗争。日本人民的反美斗争，是对越南人民抗美救国斗争的有力支援。觉醒起来的日本人民，绝不允许佐藤之流把日本变成美帝国主义在亚洲发动侵略战争的温床。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席指出：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”日本反动派如果执迷不悟，跟着美帝国主义在侵略冒险的道路上走下去，到头来只能充当美帝国主义的殉葬品！
