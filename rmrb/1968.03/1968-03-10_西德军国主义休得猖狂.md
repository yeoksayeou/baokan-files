Several ministers from the Bonn government of West Germany and 400 members of the West German Federal Parliament recently brazenly went to West Berlin to hold a series of meetings. This is a serious provocation by West German militarists against the people of the German Democratic Republic and the people of Europe.

West Berlin is located within the territory of the German Democratic Republic and has never belonged to West Germany. However, West German militarist forces, in order to seize West Berlin, have resorted to all sorts of tricks. Last December, the mayor of West Berlin, Schütz, attended the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting at the instigation of the Bonn authorities. In January of this year, West German Chancellor Kiesinger attended an illegal meeting of the revanchist organization "Exile Christian Democratic Union" held in West Berlin. The West German government and parliament have openly held meetings in West Berlin multiple times. All of this is an attempt to create the fait accompli that West Berlin belongs to West Germany.

The annexation of West Berlin is just one part of the West German militarists' arrogant revenge plan. In recent years, the West German militarist forces, represented by the Bonn government, have become increasingly arrogant. They not only accelerate military buildup and seek to obtain nuclear weapons with the support of American imperialism but also repeatedly make arrogant statements, claiming to be the "sole representative" of Germany, refusing to recognize the Oder-Neisse Line, and even proposing a so-called "new eastern policy" to attempt to isolate and eventually annex the German Democratic Republic through "peaceful infiltration." The expansionist ambitions of West German militarism cannot but arouse serious vigilance from the revolutionary people of the world.

The reason why the Bonn clique dares to act so brazenly is not accidental. American imperialism, in order to make West Germany the main pillar of its aggressive and war policies in Europe, has long been actively fostering West German militarist forces. In recent years, it has been even more actively encouraging them to realize the so-called "unification of Germany." The West German militarists' arrogant provocation in West Berlin this time is encouraged by American imperialism.

The treacherous and capitulationist policy of the Soviet revisionist clique has also greatly emboldened the West German militarist forces. Khrushchev, in signing the peace treaty, the unification of Germany, and the status of West Berlin, repeatedly capitulated to American imperialism and West German militarism, shamelessly betraying the interests of the German people. Regarding the status of West Berlin, he abandoned the position that West Berlin is part of the territory of the German Democratic Republic and repeatedly retreated. The Brezhnev and Kosygin clique not only completely inherited Khrushchev's capitulationist line on the German question but also went further. Under the pretext of "easing European tensions" and establishing a "European collective security system," they vigorously advocate for "peaceful coexistence" and "good relations" with West Germany, colluding closely with the Bonn clique. The criminal actions of the Soviet revisionist clique have thoroughly exposed their treacherous faces of betraying the German people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." The fate of Germany can only be decided by the German people. The American imperialists, the Soviet revisionist clique, and the West German militarists, who attempt to block the forward march of history, will inevitably be crushed to pieces.

    西德军国主义休得猖狂
    本报评论员
    西德波恩政府的十几名部长和西德联邦议院的四百名议员，最近又大模大样地跑到西柏林，举行一系列的会议。这是西德军国主义者对德意志民主共和国人民和欧洲人民的一次严重挑衅。
    西柏林位于德意志民主共和国的领土上，它从来不属于西德。可是，西德军国主义势力为了要把西柏林据为己有，耍尽了阴谋。去年十二月，西柏林市长舒茨在波恩当局唆使下参加北大西洋集团组织理事会；今年一月西德政府总理基辛格又出席复仇主义者组织“流亡基督教民主联盟”在西柏林召开的非法会议。西德政府和议院公然多次在西柏林开会，这一切都是企图造成西柏林属于西德的既成事实。
    吞并西柏林只是西德军国主义势力狂妄的复仇计划的一个部分。近几年来，以波恩政府为代表的西德军国主义势力气焰越来越嚣张。它不仅加紧扩充军备，力图依靠美帝国主义取得核武器，并且一再发出狂妄的叫嚣，自命为德国的“唯一代表”，拒绝承认奥得—尼斯线，甚至提出所谓“新东方政策”，妄图通过“和平渗透”的方式来孤立并进而吞并德意志民主共和国。西德军国主义的这种扩张野心，不能不引起全世界革命人民的严重警惕。
    波恩集团之所以胆敢如此肆无忌惮地胡作非为，绝不是偶然的。美帝国主义为了使西德成为它在欧洲推行侵略政策和战争政策的主要支柱，一直加紧扶植西德军国主义势力，近年更是积极怂恿它实现所谓“德国的统一”。西德军国主义者这次在西柏林所进行的狂妄挑衅，就是得到美帝国主义鼓励的。
    苏修叛徒集团的投降叛卖政策，也大大助长西德军国主义势力的气焰。赫鲁晓夫就在签订对德和约、德国统一和西柏林地位问题上，对美帝国主义和西德军国主义一再屈膝投降，无耻地出卖德国人民的利益。对于西柏林的地位，他抛弃了西柏林是德意志民主共和国领土一部分的立场，并且一再退让。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流不仅完全继承了赫鲁晓夫在德国问题上的投降路线，而且走得更远。他们打着“缓和欧洲局势”、建立“欧洲集体安全体系”的幌子，竭力鼓吹同西德“和平共处”、发展“良好关系”，同波恩集团加紧勾结。苏修集团的这种罪恶行径，彻底暴露了他们背叛德国人民的丑恶面目。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们，“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”德国的命运只能由德国人民来决定。妄图阻挡历史车轮前进的美帝国主义、苏修叛徒集团和西德军国主义，必将被辗得粉身碎骨。
