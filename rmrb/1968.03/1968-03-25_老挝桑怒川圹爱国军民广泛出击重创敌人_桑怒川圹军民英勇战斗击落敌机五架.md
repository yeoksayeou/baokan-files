Patriotic military and civilians in Xam Nuea and Khammouane provinces of Laos have launched widespread attacks from March 12 to 20, annihilating 72 enemy troops. On March 16 and 17, the patriotic military and civilians in the Mangkham area of Xam Nuea Province forced the enemy to abandon two outposts.

Under the heavy blows of the patriotic military and civilians, American-backed bandits and right-wing troops have been surrendering in droves. In the Baty and Monsadot areas of Xam Nuea Province, nearly 40 bandits surrendered to the patriotic military and civilians from March 14 to 20. On March 18, 11 soldiers from the enemy's "special forces" stationed in the Longkang area of Xam Nuea Province also surrendered with their weapons.

According to a supplementary report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, on March 11, the patriotic armed forces in Xam Nuea Province liberated the Baty area, annihilating 167 enemy troops, including 20 American "advisors." A large amount of weapons and military supplies were captured.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, on March 13, multiple batches of American aggressor planes invaded the airspace of the southern liberated area of Khammouane Province and carried out indiscriminate bombing. The local patriotic military and civilians, filled with deep hatred for the American aggressors, fiercely attacked the invading enemy planes, shooting down two American aggressor planes.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, on March 17, the patriotic military and civilians in Xam Nuea Province shot down three invading American aggressor planes and damaged several others.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army sent a letter on March 18 to the patriotic military and civilians in Xam Nuea Province, congratulating them on their brilliant victory in liberating the entire Baty area.

The congratulatory letter pointed out that the victory of the Xam Nuea military and civilians has created favorable conditions for the Lao people to achieve greater victories.

The letter emphasized that although the U.S. imperialists and the bandit leader Souphanouvong have suffered heavy defeats, they have not abandoned their plans for "special warfare" in Laos. The letter called on the Lao patriotic military and civilians to strengthen unity, maintain high vigilance, and thoroughly smash the evil plots of U.S. imperialism and the Souphanouvong bandits.
