In the face of deepening political and economic crises and intensifying internal contradictions within the ruling class, British Foreign Secretary George Brown announced his resignation on March 15.

The ostensible reason for Brown's resignation was that Wilson, without consulting Brown, agreed to Johnson's request to close British banks and gold stock markets to help the U.S. Johnson administration cope with the most severe financial crisis in forty years of capitalist history. However, it is well known that the real reason for the British Foreign Secretary's downfall is that the Wilson government's domestic and foreign policies have repeatedly failed over the past few years, especially Britain's foreign policy of following the U.S. and acting as its junior partner, which has hit a dead end. Brown had desperately advocated for Britain to reapply to join the West European Six's "Common Market," but due to French President de Gaulle's repeated rejections, Brown was always turned away. Therefore, each setback in Britain's bid to join the "Common Market" would cause a major uproar within the British ruling class, and rumors of Brown's resignation would surface.

Following the announcement of Brown's resignation, the British government immediately declared the merger of the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office, to be led by the newly appointed Foreign Secretary Stewart, with the aim of "simplifying the structure" and cutting expenses. This once again reflects the decline of the British Empire and the dire financial straits of the British economy.

Currently, the wave of selling dollars and pounds and buying gold is accelerating the financial crisis in the capitalist world, with London at the forefront. Brown's resignation has left the Wilson government in a precarious position, facing both internal and external pressures. The March 16 editorial in The Times acknowledged: "The beleaguered Wilson government can no longer withstand any further blows."

### 政治经济危机深重　对外政策到处碰壁　英国政府内外交困　外交大臣布朗辞职

　　政治经济危机深重　对外政策到处碰壁
　　英国政府内外交困　外交大臣布朗辞职
    新华社伦敦十六日电  在英帝国主义的政治经济危机日益深重、统治集团内部矛盾日益尖锐的情况下，英国外交大臣布朗十五日宣告辞职。
    布朗辞职的表面原因是，威尔逊为了帮助美国约翰逊政府应付资本主义世界四十年来最严重的金融危机，事前未同布朗商量就答应了约翰逊提出的关闭英国银行和黄金股票市场的要求。但是，尽人皆知，这个英国外交大臣下台的真实原因是，威尔逊政府几年来推行的对内对外政策连连破产，特别是英国追随美国、充当美国的小伙计的外交政策到处碰壁，陷进了死胡同。布朗为了给内外交困的工党政府找到一条出路，曾竭力主张英国重新乞求参加西欧六国“共同市场”，但是由于法国总统戴高乐一再拒绝，布朗总是吃闭门羹。因此，在英国参加“共同市场”的问题上每遭受一次挫折，英国统治集团内部就大吵大闹一阵，布朗辞职的说法就传播出来。
    在宣布布朗辞职后，英国政府又紧接着宣布把外交部和联邦关系部合并，统归新上任的外交大臣斯图尔特领导，以“简化机构”、紧缩开支，这再次反映了英帝国的没落和英国财政经济捉襟见肘的窘状。
    目前，抛售美元、英镑，抢购黄金的浪潮正在加速推进资本主义世界的金融危机，而伦敦首当其冲。布朗的辞职使得威尔逊政府处于内外夹攻、狼狈不堪的境地。十六日的《泰晤士报》社论承认：焦头烂额的威尔逊政府“再也受不住任何打击了”。
