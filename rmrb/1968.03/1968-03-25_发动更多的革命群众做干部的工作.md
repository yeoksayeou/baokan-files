Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadre issues is a key problem in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great alliances, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit. This problem must be solved." After the establishment of the New Xiang Region Revolutionary Committee, we mobilized the masses to focus on cadre issues. Through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, we have comprehensively implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, achieving remarkable results. Currently, in the entire region, 95% of the original commune party secretaries and commune heads have been liberated; 84% of municipal and county bureau directors and above have been liberated; and over 80% of the regional committee and bureau directors and above have been liberated. This has played an important role in further consolidating and developing revolutionary great alliances and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

When the masses grasp Chairman Mao's cadre policy, they can handle issues well.

Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and resolutely following the mass line is the primary issue in implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy and correctly handling cadre issues.

In the process of liberating cadres and implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, the New Xiang Region has held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, allowing the broad revolutionary masses to fully understand and truly grasp Chairman Mao's three guiding thoughts on cadre issues: the thought of "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres"; the thought of "handling cadre issues by starting with education and expanding the scope of education"; and the thought of "selecting people based on merit from the perspective of proletarian party spirit."

The facts have proven that once the broad revolutionary masses grasp Chairman Mao's cadre policy, they can handle issues well.

The revolutionary mass organizations in Wuzhi County initially had the idea of "rather left than right" regarding cadres, and they dared not liberate the original top leader of the county, wanting the higher-level revolutionary committee to send cadres there. Later, through study classes, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on cadre issues and gradually realized: "rather left than right" in essence is "left in form, right in essence," which is to deny that the majority of cadres are good or relatively good. For the entire cadre team, including the top leader, we must look at their entire history and all their work, and see how they behaved during each movement. Because the majority of revolutionary masses grasped the thought of believing in and relying on the majority of cadres, Wuzhi County quickly liberated a large number of revolutionary leading cadres, including the original county committee first secretary. The higher level did not send a single cadre, and they formed a "three-in-one combination" leadership team supported by the broad masses.

Originally, a few leading cadres in the New Xiang Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had made mistakes to varying degrees in the past and followed the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution. Therefore, after Chairman Mao's revolutionary line achieved decisive victory in Henan, the revolutionary masses in the organization were very angry with them. In addition, these few cadres did not have a good self-criticism of the errors they made, and some people thought they were beyond redemption and did not consider their entire historical performance, delaying their liberation. Later, the revolutionary mass organizations in this organization seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues and realized: only looking at and not helping cadres who make mistakes does not conform to Chairman Mao's cadre policy and is not in line with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must allow cadres to make mistakes, allow cadres to correct mistakes, and more importantly, help cadres correct mistakes. From then on, they changed their attitude towards these few cadres, actively helping them, and established a help group. For cadres who made mistakes, on the one hand, they conducted a serious and thorough criticism; on the other hand, they organized them to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles," helping them raise their class consciousness and awareness of line struggle. They also organized them to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism together with the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, encouraging them to go to departments where there are more mass opinions to accept criticism, check their mistakes, and together with the masses expose and criticize the capitalist roaders. Through the patient help of the masses, these cadres all correctly recognized and deeply examined their mistakes, gained the understanding of the masses, and successively stood up to participate in the revolutionary ranks. Some even participated in the "three-in-one combination" leadership team of the regional revolutionary committee.

Whether to handle cadre issues from the perspective of proletarian party spirit or from the perspective of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism seems to be a relatively complex issue. However, as long as the masses are truly mobilized and truly grasp Chairman Mao's cadre policy, even the most complex issues can be resolved. Xiuwu County once had revolutionary mass organizations with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and with the interference of bad elements, the masses were split into two major factions, and cadres could not come forward. However, when the two factions of masses jointly studied Chairman Mao's cadre policy in study classes and fought against selfishness, both sides gradually realized that handling cadre issues with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is either to affirm everything or to deny everything; handling cadre issues with proletarian party spirit can fully analyze, clearly distinguish right from wrong, correctly handle, and select people based on merit. Handling cadre issues with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism can only result in mutual attacks and defenses, long-term entanglement, and confusion between good and bad; handling cadre issues with proletarian party spirit can unite and fight against the enemy, strike down a small handful, and liberate a large area. Through the struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and the enhancement of proletarian party spirit, both sides quickly reached a consensus on cadres.

Mobilize poor and lower-middle peasants to help cadres fight against selfishness

To make cadres truly stand up, the key is to help cadres draw a clear line between themselves and the small handful of capitalist roaders within the party, draw a clear line between themselves and the bourgeois reactionary line, correctly handle relations with the masses, correctly handle mass movements, and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This work also needs to be done by mobilizing the masses. The New Xiang Region Revolutionary Committee, in order to let more revolutionary masses do the ideological work of cadres, in addition to organizing cadres to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, also mobilized poor and lower-middle peasants to help cadres fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism. For example, in Xiaodong Commune of Wuzhi County, a brigade party secretary had errors that he did not correct and even blamed the masses, and the masses had many opinions about him. The commune revolutionary committee helped him repeatedly study the latest instructions of "you must put politics in command, go among the masses, and together with the masses, make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better," and let him participate in the Mao Zedong Thought study class. In the study class, he and the poor and lower-middle peasants together exposed their selfish thoughts, dug out the roots of selfishness, and recalled bitterness and thought of sweetness. During the recall of bitterness and sweetness, his tears flowed with those of the poor and lower-middle peasants, his hatred and love were the same, and the more they talked, the more they felt the seriousness of their mistakes, feeling guilty towards Chairman Mao and the poor and lower-middle peasant class brothers, and voluntarily went door to door to check their mistakes and seek the opinions of the masses. Many old poor peasants said to him with class feelings: "You have been a suffering child since you were young and should strive for Chairman Mao and the poor and lower-middle peasants. As long as you correct your mistakes, my whole family will support you." After eliminating the estrangement with the masses, he was elected by the revolutionary masses as a major leader of the brigade.

Now, many cadres who have made mistakes deeply feel: the masses are reasonable, as long as they go among the masses and seriously examine their mistakes, even if they have made serious mistakes, the masses will forgive them; on the contrary, if they cannot correctly handle the criticism and struggle of the masses, cannot correctly handle mass movements, correctly handle the masses, and correctly handle themselves, even if the mistakes are not big, it will be difficult to gain the forgiveness of the masses.

Cadres place themselves under the supervision of the revolutionary masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The unity of the state, the unity of the people, and the unity of various nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause." After the establishment of the revolutionary committees at various levels in the New Xiang Region, we continue to mobilize the masses to do the work of cadres, which has played a significant role in continuously strengthening the unity of the leadership core, strengthening the unity of old and new cadres, and achieving ideological transformation.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, the work is complex and varied. The most fundamental thing is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, arm the minds of the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve the ideological transformation of people. To achieve this, we must first achieve the ideological transformation of the leading cadre team. After the establishment of the revolutionary committees at various levels in the New Xiang Region, they first discussed this major issue and realized that the ideological transformation of the leading cadre team must take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively, establish the style of hard struggle, and place themselves under the supervision of the broad revolutionary masses. Various places have generally promoted the "three-thirds" work method. From the committee members of the revolutionary committee to the general staff, one-third of the people regularly participate in study classes, one-third go to the countryside for investigation and research and participate in labor, and one-third maintain daily work in the office. This method has been supported by the broad revolutionary masses and has begun to achieve good results.

    发动更多的革命群众做干部的工作
    河南省新乡地区革命委员会
    毛主席教导我们说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”新乡地区革命委员会成立以后，就发动群众，狠抓干部问题。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，已收到了显著的效果。目前全区原公社正副书记、社长一级的干部，已解放的占百分之九十五；市、县科局长以上干部，已解放的占百分之八十四；地委专署直属局处长以上干部，已解放的占百分之八十以上。这对进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，起了重要的作用。
    群众掌握了毛主席的干部政策，就会把问题处理得很好
    相信群众，依靠群众，坚决走群众路线，是贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，正确对待干部的首要问题。
    新乡地区在解放干部、实行革命三结合的过程中，通过大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，让广大革命群众充分理解、切实掌握了毛主席关于干部问题的三个指导思想，即：“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的思想；“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”的思想；从无产阶级党性出发，“任人唯贤”的思想。
    事实证明，广大革命群众一旦掌握了毛主席的干部政策，便会把问题处理得很好。
    武陟县的革命群众组织，对干部一度有过宁“左”勿右的想法，对县里原来的第一把手不敢解放，要上级革命委员会派干部去。后来，他们在学习班里反复学习了毛主席关于干部问题的指示，逐渐认识到：宁“左”勿右，实质上是形“左”实右，是否定干部大多数是好的和比较好的。对整个干部队伍，包括第一把手在内，必须看他们的全部历史和全部工作，看他们在历次运动中的大节如何。由于大多数革命群众掌握了相信和依靠干部的大多数的思想，武陟县很快就解放了包括原县委第一书记在内的大批革命领导干部。上级并没有派一个干部去，他们就组成了一个为广大群众所拥护的“三结合”领导班子。
    原中共新乡地委机关有几个领导干部，过去有过程度不同的错误，在文化大革命中又执行了资产阶级反动路线。因此，当毛主席的革命路线在河南取得了决定性胜利以后，机关的革命群众对他们的火气非常大，再加上这几个干部，对自己所犯的错误检查认识得不够好，有的人就认为他们不可救药了，不考虑他们的全部历史表现，迟迟不愿解放。后来，这个机关的革命群众组织认真学习了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，认识到：对犯错误的干部只看不帮，这不符合毛主席的干部政策，不是毛主席的革命路线。要允许干部犯错误，也要允许干部改正错误，更要帮助干部改正错误。从此，他们就改变了对这几个干部的态度，主动地加以帮助，还成立了帮助小组。对犯错误的干部，一方面进行了严肃认真的批判；另一方面组织他们学习毛主席的最新指示，学习“老三篇”，帮助他们提高阶级觉悟和路线斗争的觉悟。又组织他们参加毛泽东思想学习班，和无产阶级革命派一起斗私批修，鼓励他们到群众意见比较大的部门去接受批评，检查错误，和群众一起揭发批判走资派。通过群众耐心的帮助，这几个干部都正确地认识和深刻检查了自己的错误，取得了群众的谅解，先后站出来参加了革命行列，有的还参加了地区革委会“三结合”领导班子。
    从无产阶级党性出发，还是从资产阶级、小资产阶级派性出发来对待干部，看来是个比较复杂的问题。但是，只要群众真正发动起来了，真正掌握了毛主席的干部政策，再复杂的问题，也能迎刃而解。修武县就曾经因为革命群众组织有资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，再加上坏人插手，使群众分裂成两大派，干部迟迟站不出来。但是，当两派群众共同在学习班学习了毛主席的干部政策，狠斗了“私”字后，双方就逐渐认识到，以资产阶级、小资产阶级派性对待干部，不是肯定一切，就是否定一切；以无产阶级党性对待干部，才能全面分析，是非分明，正确对待，任人唯贤。以资产阶级、小资产阶级派性对待干部，只能是你打我保，我保你揪，长期纠缠，好坏不分；以无产阶级党性对待干部，才能团结一致，共同对敌，打击一小撮，解放一大片。通过反资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强了无产阶级党性，双方很快对干部取得了一致意见。
      发动贫下中农帮助干部斗私
    要使干部真正地站出来，关键还是帮助干部和党内一小撮走资派划清界限，和资产阶级反动路线划清界限，正确地对待群众，正确地对待群众运动，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。这个工作也要发动群众来做。新乡地区革命委员会为了让更多的革命群众来做干部的思想工作，除组织干部参加毛泽东思想学习班忆苦思甜外，还发动贫下中农帮助干部斗私批修。例如，武陟县小董公社一个大队支部书记，有错误不检查，还埋怨群众，群众对他意见很大。公社革委会帮助他反复学习了“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的最新指示，让他参加了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，他和贫下中农一起亮“私”心，挖“私”根，忆苦思甜。在忆苦思甜时，他和贫下中农的眼泪流在一起，恨在一起，爱在一起，越谈越感到自己的错误严重，对不起毛主席，对不起贫下中农阶级弟兄，就主动登门上户检查错误，征求群众意见。许多老贫农满怀阶级感情对他说：“你从小就是个受苦的孩子，应该为毛主席争气，为贫下中农争气，只要你改正错误，我全家都支持你。”在消除了和群众的隔阂之后，他又被革命群众选为大队的主要领导成员。
    现在，许多犯过错误的干部都深深体会到：群众是通情达理的，只要到群众中去，认真检查自己的错误，即使犯了严重错误，群众也会谅解的；相反，如果不能正确对待群众的批判和斗争，不能正确对待群众运动，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，即使错误不大，也很难取得群众的谅解。
    干部把自己放在革命群众的监督下
    毛主席教导我们：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”新乡地区各级革命委员会成立以后，继续发动群众作干部的工作，这对不断加强领导核心的团结，加强新老干部的团结，实现思想革命化，起了不小的作用。
    革命委员会成立之后，工作千头万绪，最根本的是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑，实现人的思想革命化。而要作到这一点，又必须首先作到领导班子的思想革命化。新乡地区各级革命委员会成立之后，都首先讨论了这个重大问题，认识到领导班子思想革命化，必须带头活学活用毛泽东思想，树立艰苦奋斗的作风，把自己置于广大革命群众的监督之下。各地普遍推行了“三三制”的工作方法，从革委会的主任、委员到一般工作人员，经常有三分之一的人参加学习班学习，三分之一的人下乡调查研究和参加劳动，三分之一的人在机关坚持日常工作。这个方法，得到了广大革命群众的拥护，并开始收到了良好的效果。
