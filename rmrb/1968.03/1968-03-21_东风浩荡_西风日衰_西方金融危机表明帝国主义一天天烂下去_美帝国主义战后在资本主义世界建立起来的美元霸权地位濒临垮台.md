In the face of the burgeoning revolutionary struggles of the people worldwide, the imperialist bloc led by the United States is currently undergoing the most severe financial crisis in forty years; the entire imperialist system is experiencing the strongest shock since the 1929-1933 capitalist economic crisis. This fully demonstrates that imperialism is rotting away day by day and is accelerating towards comprehensive collapse.

Since late February this year, a wave of unprecedented and prolonged gold-buying frenzy has swept through the financial centers of Western Europe. In London, Paris, Zurich, and other gold markets, crowds of people rushed to buy gold, frantically dumping their dollars and pounds, and crazily snatching up the gold on the market. The volume of gold transactions in major markets in Western Europe has increased by hundreds of tons, far exceeding the usual levels by dozens of times. The gold price in the Paris market once soared to over $44 per ounce, far exceeding the official price of $35 per ounce set by the United States. The buying spree has also extended to other precious metals like platinum and silver; some have even indiscriminately hoarded copper, cocoa, coffee, and other commodities, causing a sharp rise in commodity market prices. Under the impact of this gold-buying frenzy, which has lasted for more than half a month, the Western world's monetary system centered on the dollar has essentially begun to collapse; the entire capitalist world's financial transactions, foreign exchange trading, stock trading, and commodity trading have all been greatly affected, falling into paralysis or chaos. All of this has caused the ruling cliques of the imperialist countries to panic, living in constant fear, and issuing desperate wails.

This financial crisis that has swept the entire capitalist world has erupted against the backdrop of the deepening political and economic crisis of imperialism, and is the inevitable result of the U.S. imperialists' intensified policy of aggression and war. The development of events over the years has proven that it is precisely this policy of aggression and war that has greatly consumed the limited financial and material resources of U.S. imperialism, making the dollar crisis increasingly severe and the dollar's hegemonic position in the Western world shaky.

At the end of World War II, the U.S. imperialists, having profited greatly from the war, relied on their overwhelming advantage in the financial and trade sectors of the capitalist world to dominate and act arbitrarily. At that time, they controlled about 70% of the world's gold. Relying on this, they established a monetary system centered on the dollar in the capitalist world. In this system, only the dollar could be directly exchanged for gold; other countries' currencies could not be directly exchanged for gold but were pegged to the dollar to determine their own exchange rates (for example, one pound sterling equals 2.4 dollars; four German marks equal one dollar, etc.). This effectively gave the dollar the privilege of being on par with gold.

Over the past twenty years, U.S. imperialism, in order to establish world hegemony, has used the privileged position of the dollar to export capital, provide economic and military "aid," and other means to recklessly issue dollars, crazily engage in economic plunder, and at the same time, the United States has established military bases everywhere in the world to carry out military aggression. All of this has led to a large outflow of dollars. It is precisely because of this situation that the United States' international balance of payments has almost always shown a huge deficit, the United States' gold reserves have been decreasing, while the dollars issued abroad have been accumulating. So far, the United States' gold reserves have only about $11.4 billion (almost half of what it was at the end of the war), while the total amount of dollars held by foreigners (which can be redeemed for gold at any time) has reached about $35 billion, more than twice the current gold reserves of the United States. At the same time, U.S. imperialism has been recklessly expanding military spending at home, issuing paper money, and causing the actual purchasing power of the dollar to continuously decline. All of these factors have caused the Western world's trust in the dollar to increasingly waver.

It must be pointed out that in recent years, with the escalation of the Vietnam War and the increasing war expenditures, the U.S. fiscal budget and international balance of payments deficit have further expanded, shaking the position of the dollar.

The dollar is not only a symbol of U.S. imperialist financial power and an important means for the United States to control, infiltrate, exploit, and enslave other countries, but it is also the "backbone" supporting the financial and monetary system of the Western world. More than 60% of capitalist world trade is settled in dollars. The vast majority of capitalist countries' gold and foreign exchange reserves are mostly, if not entirely, in dollars. Therefore, the fate of the dollar's position not only affects the United States itself but also involves the entire Western world. The collapse of the dollar means that U.S. imperialism's hegemony in the Western world will also collapse, and at the same time, it also means that all capitalist countries will be affected to varying degrees according to their dependence on the United States.

The current financial crisis in the Western world is one that imperialism cannot escape. Since the end of the war, with the flourishing revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the "territory" for imperialist exploitation and plunder has been increasingly shrinking, their strength has been continuously weakened, and their political and economic contradictions have become increasingly intense. This makes the current crisis particularly severe and profound, while the imperialist countries led by U.S. imperialism have very limited room to cope with the crisis. Although U.S. imperialism is still struggling desperately, trying to extricate itself from the crisis, the U.S. financial oligarchs and bourgeois press admit helplessly that the United States currently has no truly effective countermeasures to fundamentally improve the position of the dollar.

The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "We are now in an era when the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse, and the imperialists have fallen into an insoluble crisis." The current severe financial crisis is greatly accelerating the process of the entire imperialist system heading towards comprehensive collapse.

    东风浩荡　西风日衰
    西方金融危机表明帝国主义一天天烂下去
    美帝国主义战后在资本主义世界建立起来的美元霸权地位濒临垮台
    据新华社二十日讯　本社记者报道：在全世界人民革命斗争蓬勃发展的形势下，以美国为首的帝国主义集团，目前正在经历着一场四十年来最严重的金融危机的猛烈袭击；整个帝国主义制度正受到一九二九——一九三三年资本主义经济大危机以来最强烈的震撼。这充分表明，帝国主义正在一天天烂下去，加速走向全面崩溃。
    从今年二月底开始，西欧各金融中心刮起了一场空前持久、空前猛烈的抢购黄金风潮。在伦敦、巴黎、苏黎世等黄金市场上，挤满了抢购黄金的人群，拚命地抛出手中持有的美元、英镑钞票，疯狂抢购上市的黄金，使西欧各主要市场上的黄金交易量成百吨地增长，超出平日几十倍；巴黎市场上的金价曾一度上涨到每盎司四十四美元以上，大大突破了美国规定的三十五美元一盎司的官方牌价。抢购的范围还扩大到了白金、白银等贵重金属；有人甚至饥不择食地大量囤购铜、可可、咖啡等原料，从而引起了商品市场价格的剧烈上涨。在这股持续已达半月以上的抢购黄金风潮的猛烈打击下，以美元为中心的西方世界货币体系实际上已经开始崩溃；整个资本主义世界的金融往来、外汇交易、股票交易和商品交易无不受到极大震动，陷入了瘫痪或混乱状态。这一切使得帝国主义国家的统治集团恐慌万状，惶惶不可终日，纷纷发出绝望的哀号。
    这次席卷整个资本主义世界的金融危机是在帝国主义政治经济总危机不断加深的背景下爆发的，是美帝国主义加紧推行侵略和战争政策的必然结果。多年来的事态发展证明，正是由于这种侵略和战争政策极大地消耗着美帝国主义有限的财力物力，使得美元危机日益深重，美元在西方世界的霸权地位摇摇欲坠。
    第二次世界大战结束之初，在战争中大发了横财的美帝国主义，仗着它在资本主义世界金融和贸易领域内取得的压倒优势地位，称王称霸，为所欲为。当时它手里掌握着西方世界全部黄金的百分之七十左右。凭借着这一点，它在资本主义世界建立了以美元为中心的货币体系。在这个体系中，只有美元可以直接兑换成黄金；其他国家的货币不能直接兑换黄金，而是同美元挂钩以确定自己的比价（例如，一个英镑折合二点四美元；四个西德马克折合一美元等）。这样就实际上使美元取得了与黄金“平起平坐”的特权地位。
    二十多年来，美帝国主义为了建立世界霸权，利用了美元的这种特权地位，通过输出资本、提供经济和军事“援助”等各种方式，向国外滥发美钞，疯狂进行经济掠夺，同时，美国还在世界各地到处建立军事基地，进行军事侵略，这些都导致了美元的大量外流。正是由于这种情况，美国的国际收支几乎年年都出现巨额赤字，美国的黄金储备越来越减少，而流到国外的美元纸币却越积越多。到目前为止，美国的黄金储备只剩下了一百一十四亿多美元（比战后初期几乎少了一半），而外国人手里拥有的（可以随时要求兑换黄金的）美钞总和则达到了三百五十亿美元左右，超过美国目前黄金储备两倍多。在这同时，美帝国主义在国内疯狂扩大军费开支，滥发钞票，使美元的实际购买力不断下降。所有这些都使得西方世界对美元的信任日益动摇。
    必须指出的是，近年来，随着侵越战争不断“升级”，战费不断增加，进一步扩大了美国的财政预算和国际收支的亏空，动摇着美元的地位。
    美元不仅是美帝国主义金融实力的象征，是美国用来控制、渗透、剥削和奴役其他国家的一个重要手段，而且也是支撑着西方世界金融货币体系的“脊椎骨”。资本主义世界贸易的百分之六十以上是用美元来结算的。绝大多数资本主义国家的黄金外汇储备中，大部分、甚至全部都是美元。因此，美元地位的安危就不仅涉及美国本身，而且牵涉到整个西方世界。美元的垮台，意味着美帝国主义在西方世界的霸权将随之完蛋，同时也意味着所有资本主义国家也将根据它们对美国依附的程度受到不同程度的打击。
    当前西方世界的这场金融危机是帝国主义所无法逃避的。战后以来，随着亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命运动的蓬勃发展，帝国主义进行剥削和掠夺的“地盘”越来越缩小，它们的力量不断被削弱，它们之间在政治上和经济上的矛盾也越来越激烈。这就使当前的危机特别严重，特别深刻，而以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义国家应付危机的余地十分有限。尽管美帝国主义还在进行绝望的挣扎，妄图从危机的漩涡中挣脱出来，但是美国金融寡头和资产阶级报刊无可奈何地承认，美国目前拿不出任何真正有效的对策来根本改善美元的地位。
    无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。当前这场严重的金融危机就正在大大加速整个帝国主义制度走向全面崩溃的进程。
