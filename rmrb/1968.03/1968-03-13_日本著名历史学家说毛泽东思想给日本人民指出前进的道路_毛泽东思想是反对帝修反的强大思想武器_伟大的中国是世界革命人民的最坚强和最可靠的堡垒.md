Japanese renowned historian and Kyoto University professor Inoue Kiyoshi recently spoke to a Chinese reporter, highly praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. He pointed out that as long as people around the world follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, then the final victory will definitely belong to the people.

Inoue said that under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the current situation in Japan and the world is increasingly favorable to the people and unfavorable to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. U.S. imperialism has now fallen into a serious crisis worldwide. He said, the great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The United States has established hundreds of military bases in many countries around the world. The Chinese territory of Taiwan, Lebanon, and all U.S. military bases abroad are nooses around the neck of U.S. imperialism. It is not others but the Americans themselves who made these nooses and put them around their own necks, handing the other end of the noose to the Chinese people, the Arab peoples, and all peace-loving, anti-aggression peoples of the world. The longer the U.S. aggressors stay in these places, the tighter the noose around their necks will become." Inoue said, the situation of U.S. imperialism today is exactly like this.

Inoue said that U.S. imperialism is now more brazenly than ever using the Japanese reactionaries, and the Japanese reactionaries are more shamelessly selling out to U.S. imperialism, serving the desperate U.S. imperialism. Inoue emphasized that the ugly face of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique of Miyamoto, in collusion with the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and Soviet modern revisionism, has been fully exposed.

Inoue said that the broad masses of the Japanese people have seen through the reactionary nature of U.S. imperialism and the Sato government and are waging a fearless and heroic struggle against their fascist rule.

Inoue said that in recent years, Mao Zedong Thought has spread in Japan at a speed beyond people's imagination. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of the Japanese people have continuously grown and consolidated their strength in the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, finding their way forward.

Inoue pointed out that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for the Japanese and all revolutionary peoples of the world to fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries. It is a sharp weapon for the Japanese and all revolutionary peoples of the world to observe the development of world historical trends. Inoue stressed that the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought and the great People's Republic of China are the strongest and most reliable bastion for all revolutionary peoples of the world. The great China is inspiring the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations around the world for independence and liberation.

　　日本著名历史学家说毛泽东思想给日本人民指出前进的道路
　　毛泽东思想是反对帝修反的强大思想武器
　　伟大的中国是世界革命人民的最坚强和最可靠的堡垒
    新华社东京十二日电  日本著名历史学家、京都大学教授井上清最近对中国记者发表谈话，高度赞扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他指出，只要全世界人民遵循伟大导师毛主席的教导，勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想，坚决地同帝修反进行斗争，那末，最后的胜利一定属于人民。
    井上说，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，今天日本和世界形势的发展越来越有利于人民，而不利于帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。美帝国主义今天在全世界范围内已经陷入严重危机之中。他说，伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“美国在全世界许多国家建立了几百个军事基地。中国领土台湾、黎巴嫩以及所有美国在外国的军事基地，都是套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索。不是别人而是美国人自己制造这种绞索，并把它套在自己的脖子上，而把绞索的另一端交给了中国人民、阿拉伯各国人民和全世界一切爱和平反侵略的人民。美国侵略者在这些地方停留得越久，套在它的头上的绞索就将越紧。”井上说，今天美帝国主义的处境，正是这样。
    井上说，美帝国主义现在比任何时候都更加明目张胆地利用日本反动派，而日本反动派也更加卖身投靠美帝国主义，为日暮途穷的美帝国主义效劳。井上强调指出，日共宫本修正主义集团同美日反动派以及苏联现代修正主义相勾结的丑恶面目已经暴露无遗。
    井上说，广大的日本人民群众看穿了美帝国主义和佐藤政府的反动本质，并同它们的法西斯统治展开了大无畏的英勇斗争。
    井上说，近年来，毛泽东思想在日本以超过人们想象的速度得到了空前的传播。广大日本人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在同帝修反的斗争中，不断地壮大和巩固了自己的力量，找到了他们前进的道路。
    井上指出，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是日本和全世界革命人民同帝修反进行斗争的强大思想武器，是日本和全世界革命人民用以观察世界历史潮流发展的锐利武器。井上强调说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民和伟大的中华人民共和国是全世界革命人民的最坚强和最可靠的堡垒。伟大的中国正鼓舞着全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取独立与解放的斗争。
