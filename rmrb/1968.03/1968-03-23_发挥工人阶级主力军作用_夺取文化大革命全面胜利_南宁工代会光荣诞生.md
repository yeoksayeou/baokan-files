In the triumphant songs of achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of all ethnic groups in Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, achieved revolutionary unity. From March 18 to 20, they successfully held the first congress of the Nanning working class, announcing the establishment of the Nanning Workers' Congress. This is a significant achievement in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in Nanning, and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The preparatory group of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the leaders of the Guangxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and the leaders of the Nanning garrison, including Wei Guoqing, Wei Youzhu, Jiao Hongguang, Wu Jinnan, An Pingsheng, and Xu Qihai, attended the founding ceremony.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of all ethnic groups in Nanning enthusiastically responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Together with the broad revolutionary masses, they launched a fierce attack against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Guangxi, and against the capitalist roaders, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and making significant contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi. After Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China were conveyed, the workers of Nanning were overjoyed and quickly launched a wave of earnest study and comprehensive implementation. Under the support and help of the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, they organized extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, taking "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeois reactionary line" as the key link, thoroughly criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeois reactionary line, and thoroughly criticizing and repudiating the "private" character, establishing the "public" character, eliminating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening proletarian party spirit, opposing anarchism, enhancing revolutionary organization and discipline, eliminating interference from the right and ultra-left, taking the lead in achieving revolutionary unity and promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and setting an example for the broad revolutionary masses in the Nanning area.

At the conference, Comrade Wei Youzhu, on behalf of the preparatory group of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the Guangxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and the Nanning garrison, extended warm congratulations to the conference.

The representatives of the Workers' Congress expressed in their speeches that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

During the conference, the representatives exchanged experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieving and consolidating revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

The conference, amidst warm applause and cheers, passed a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao. It also passed a letter of greeting to all the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army and a letter to all revolutionary workers in the city.
