The nationwide proletarian revolutionary masses have been holding grand celebrations and parades over the past few days, enthusiastically hailing the one-year anniversary of the issuance of our great leader Chairman Mao's famous March 7 Directive on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the re-publication of the full text of this great directive.

In various places, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people, with profound proletarian feelings of boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty towards the great leader of the proletariat Chairman Mao, have repeatedly reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings in the March 7 Directive: "The army should, in stages and batches, conduct military training for universities, middle schools, and upper-grade elementary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, rectifying organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership organs, and carrying out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. First, conduct pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually promote them. It is also necessary to persuade the students to implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself. During military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes. Except for the elderly and the sick, let these people participate to facilitate their reform. All these, as long as they are done seriously, the problems are not difficult to solve." They pointed out that Chairman Mao's brilliant and extremely important directive is a great strategic deployment for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has extremely great significance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They resolutely declared that they would be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, further fully implement Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive and a series of latest directives, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary masses of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin have held discussions, study sessions, and celebration meetings over the past few days. A number of colleges and universities in the capital, as well as some middle and elementary schools in the distant suburbs, established revolutionary committees on the occasion of welcoming and celebrating the first anniversary of the issuance of Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive. Today, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of these schools are particularly excited and held meetings to enthusiastically hail the re-publication of Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive. In Shanghai, thousands of primary, secondary, and higher education institutions have held special lectures and discussions over the past few days to commemorate the first anniversary of the issuance of Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive. The entire city has 24 institutions of higher learning, all of which have established revolutionary committees by March 7, achieving a complete red victory. Revolutionary teachers and students excitedly said that the great March 7 Directive is a beacon illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will use concrete actions to further fully implement Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive and a series of latest directives, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The news of the re-publication of the full text of Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive reached Tianjin City's Yan'an Middle School, and the entire school was in high spirits. Revolutionary teachers and students, with tears of excitement, repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" They beat drums and gongs, joyfully went to the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee to report the good news, and immediately organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to propagate Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive. At the same time, they studied and discussed with the military training team stationed at the school. Revolutionary teachers and students resolutely declared that in the future, they would, with the help of the military training team, study, implement, propagate, and defend Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive more diligently. They would imprint Chairman Mao's great directive in their minds and implement it in their actions, following the course charted by Chairman Mao, and turn Yan'an Middle School into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Liu Zihou and Zhang Yinghui spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive is a great strategic deployment for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and is a programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive and a series of latest directives, Hebei Province's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. In the face of a good revolutionary situation, the province's proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses should not be arrogant or complacent, and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, further fully implement Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive and a series of latest directives, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

More than fifty thousand revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, along with soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, held a celebration meeting in Guiyang, Guizhou Province. Li Zaichan, a leader from the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Guizhou Military Region, spoke at the meeting. He said that the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in Guizhou Province, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive and inspired by Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts, have achieved great success in resuming classes and making revolution. He called on the broad revolutionary teachers and students to learn from the People's Liberation Army, uphold the four firsts, carry forward the spirit of March 8th, arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and wage a "people's war" to suppress bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, making new contributions to the educational revolution and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In their speeches, they called on the broad proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They should be models in learning, propagating, implementing, and defending Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive and a series of latest directives, and be proletarian revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they should achieve new successes. The Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee decided on March 8 that all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations in the province should seriously study and further fully implement Chairman Mao's March 7 Directive. At the celebration meeting held on March 8 for the establishment of the Lanzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee, one hundred thousand revolutionary masses and soldiers from the Lanzhou Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, with profound proletarian feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically celebrated the re-publication of the brilliant March 7 Directive and expressed their determination to further fully implement it.
