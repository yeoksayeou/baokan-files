According to Xinhua News Agency, the Eastern Communications Agency reported that more than four thousand farmers from Chiba Prefecture and workers from Tokyo and various prefectures in the Kanto region held a rally in Sanrizuka on the 20th. They strongly protested against the reactionary Sato government's plan to build the new Tokyo International Airport, which serves the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam.

The rally site was adorned with red flags. Many Japanese farmers participating in the rally wore badges of the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and marched into the venue with high spirits.

The rally passed a resolution stating that the struggles against the construction of the airport held on February 26 and March 10 in Narita City had dealt a heavy blow to the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to build the airport.

The resolution pointed out that the struggle against the construction of the airport in Sanrizuka is an integral part of the nationwide anti-U.S. patriotic struggles in Japan, including the struggle against U.S. aggression in Vietnam and the struggle against U.S. military bases. The resolution vowed to carry this struggle through to the end.

The chairman of the Central Council Against Airport Construction, Tanoya Yuzuru, spoke at the rally. He said: Any reactionary force, if it stands against the united broad masses of the people, is bound to fail. The victory of the Vietnamese people clearly proves this.

The representative of the Sanrizuka Farmers' Alliance Against Airport Construction, Sei Seiri, spoke at the rally. He said: We will not give up an inch of land, and we will not allow the airport to be built in Sanrizuka. We farmers will unite with patriotic workers, students, and the broad masses of the people, fear no violence, smash the enemy's attempts to sow discord, and resolutely carry the struggle against the construction of the airport to the end.

The participants also held a massive demonstration march in the area designated for the airport construction.

Recently, representatives from workers', farmers', and mass organizations from various counties near Tokyo and all over Japan have continuously come to Sanrizuka to support the local farmers' struggle.

On the 18th, Chairman Koyama Yuichi of the Japanese Journalists' Alliance talked with the farmers in Sanrizuka. He said, Chairman Mao's telegram to the Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho, said: "To hold out is to win." Chairman Mao's words are completely applicable to your struggle.

The Japanese Journalists' Alliance recently issued a statement firmly supporting the heroic struggle of the Sanrizuka farmers against the construction of the so-called "new international airport" by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. It highly praised the close unity of the farmers, workers, students, and citizens in the struggle.

The statement pointed out that the struggle in Sanrizuka is an integral part of the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and the struggle for national liberation.

The statement called on the Japanese people to strengthen their unity, summon their courage, strive for the victory of the Sanrizuka struggle, and push the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle to new heights.

The headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) recently also issued a statement firmly supporting the anti-U.S. struggle of the Sanrizuka farmers and severely condemning the fascist suppression by the reactionary Sato government against patriotic youth, students, and workers and peasants.

In the face of the growing unity of the Sanrizuka farmers and patriotic people and the developing anti-U.S. struggle, the revisionist group of Moshige, who have already become the lackeys of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, are plotting to split the Japanese people's anti-U.S. movement. On the 17th, they held a so-called "anti-airport construction" rally. However, the farmers immediately saw through their tricks. The farmers pointed out that the Moshige group wants to undermine our unity and disperse our fighting strength. We will not be deceived.

    支持三里塚人民反对修建机场的斗争
    反对佐藤政府为美帝侵越效劳
    日本各地四千多工人农民在三里塚集会示威
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道，日本千叶县农民以及东京和关东地区各县的工人共四千多人，二十日在三里塚举行大会，强烈抗议佐藤反动政府修建东京新国际机场，为美帝侵越战争效劳的罪恶勾当。
    大会会场上红旗招展。参加大会的许多日本农民，胸前佩戴着无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的像章，斗志昂扬地走进会场。
    大会通过一项决议指出：二月二十六日、三月十日在成田市举行的反对修建机场的斗争，沉重地打击了美日反动派建设机场的阴谋。
    决议指出，反对在三里塚修建机场的斗争，是日本全国范围内反对美帝侵略越南、反对美军基地斗争等反美爱国斗争的一个组成部分。决议表示一定要把这一斗争进行到底。
    反对建设机场中央协议会主席淡谷悠藏在大会上发言。他说：任何反动势力，如果他们同团结起来的广大人民为敌，是必定要遭到失败的，越南人民的胜利最清楚地证明了这一点。
    三里塚农民反对修建机场同盟的代表濑利诚在会上讲话。他说：我们绝不放弃一寸土地，绝不允许在三里塚建设机场。我们农民要同爱国的工人、学生和广大人民团结一致，不畏强暴，粉碎敌人的挑拨离间，坚决把反对建设机场的斗争进行到底。
    参加大会的群众还在预定建设机场的地区，举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
    最近，东京附近各县以及日本全国各地不断地有许多工人、农民和群众组织的代表来到三里塚，支持当地农民的斗争。
    日本记者同盟主席小林雄一十八日在三里塚同农民谈话时说，毛主席给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团阮友寿主席的贺电中说：“坚持下去就是胜利。”毛主席的这句话对你们的斗争是完全适用的。
    日本记者同盟最近发表声明，坚决支持三里塚农民反对美日反动派修建所谓“新国际机场”的英勇斗争，高度赞扬农民、工人、学生和市民在斗争中的紧密团结。
    声明指出，三里塚的斗争是反对美帝国主义侵略战争和争取民族解放斗争的一个组成部分。
    声明号召日本人民加强团结，鼓起勇气，争取三里塚斗争的胜利，并且把反美爱国斗争推向新高潮。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部最近也发表声明，坚决支持三里塚农民的反美斗争，并严厉谴责佐藤反动政府对爱国青年、学生和工农群众的法西斯镇压。
    在三里塚农民和爱国人民的团结日益加强，反美斗争日益发展的情况下，已经堕落成美日反动派帮凶的日共宫本修正主义集团，阴谋分裂日本人民的反美运动。他们在十七日举行了一个所谓“反对建设机场”的集会。但是，农民们立即看穿了他们的诡计。农民们指出，宫本集团是要破坏我们的团结，涣散我们的斗争力量，我们决不受骗。
