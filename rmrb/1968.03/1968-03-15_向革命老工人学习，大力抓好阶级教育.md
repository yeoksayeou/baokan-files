Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Gongchangling Iron Mine has invited old workers to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using their personal experiences to conduct bitter-sweet class education for young comrades. This is a very good experience.

Bitter-sweet class education is the most vivid and practical form of political education. If one does not understand what class is, does not understand what exploitation is, one will not understand revolution, will not deeply comprehend Mao Zedong Thought, and will not be able to effectively carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by firmly grasping class education can we fundamentally raise the proletarian consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses, enhance the self-awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and strengthen the resolve to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary old workers suffered the most and were oppressed the heaviest in the old society. They all have a tragic history of blood and tears, and they all have a ledger of past sufferings and present joys. They deeply understand how the people of our country, under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, after a long period of arduous struggle, finally won liberation; they also understand that if the capitalist restoration plot of the Chinese Khrushchev succeeds, the working people will suffer twice the bitterness and twice the pain. The personal experiences of revolutionary old workers are living textbooks for conducting class education among the broad masses, especially the younger generation, and their role should be fully utilized.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Many young people, due to their lack of political experience and social life experience, are not good at comparing old China with new China, and find it difficult to deeply understand how our people have gone through countless hardships in their struggle to shake off the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and how much long-term arduous labor is needed to build a beautiful socialist society."

Chairman Mao also points out: "We must strengthen class education for the youth and raise their class consciousness, and have them learn from outstanding old workers."

During the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary youngsters have displayed the bold spirit of daring to think, speak, act, venture, and revolution of the proletariat, making significant contributions. However, young comrades, who have grown up under the red flag, have no direct experience of class oppression and class exploitation. If they do not frequently receive class education and do not pay attention to raising their class consciousness, it is easy for bourgeois individualism to grow, and they may even go astray.

Young comrades should humbly learn from revolutionary old workers, never forget the class bitterness, and always remember the blood debt; be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; strive harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, constantly engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness; learn from Chairman Mao's works and from revolutionary old workers the revolutionary traditions of the Party, learn the excellent qualities of the working class, strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, enhance proletarian party spirit, resolutely resist and overcome the influences of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist thoughts, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and temper themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

　　向革命老工人学习，大力抓好阶级教育

    鞍山钢铁公司弓长岭铁矿，吸收老工人参加毛泽东思想学习班，用他们的亲身经历对青年同志进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育。这是一个很好的经验。
    忆苦思甜的阶级教育，是一种最生动最实际的政治教育。不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命，就不能深刻理解毛泽东思想，就不能很好地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。只有狠抓阶级教育，才能从根本上提高广大革命群众的无产阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，增强落实毛主席最新指示的自觉性和把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的坚强决心。
    革命的老工人，在旧社会受苦最深，受压迫最重。他们都有一部悲惨的血泪史，都有一本苦尽甘来的今昔对比账。他们深切了解我国人民是怎样在毛主席的英明领导下，经过长期的艰苦卓绝的斗争才争得了解放；也最懂得如果中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋得逞，劳动人民就要吃二遍苦，受二茬罪。革命老工人的亲身经历，是对广大群众、特别是对青年一代进行阶级教育的活教材，应当充分发挥他们的作用。
    毛主席教导我们：“不少青年人由于缺少政治经验和社会生活经验，不善于把旧中国和新中国加以比较，不容易深切了解我国人民曾经怎样经历千辛万苦的斗争才摆脱了帝国主义和国民党反动派的压迫，而建立一个美好的社会主义社会要经过怎样的长时间的艰苦劳动。”
    毛主席还指出：“对青年一定要加强阶级教育，提高他们的阶级觉悟，叫他们向优秀的老工人学习。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命小将发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的无产阶级战斗精神，作出了重大贡献。但是，年青的同志，生长在红旗下，对阶级压迫和阶级剥削没有直接的感受，如果不经常受到阶级教育，不注意提高自己的阶级觉悟，那就很容易滋长资产阶级自私自利的个人主义思想，甚至有可能走到邪路上去。
    青年同志要虚心地向革命老工人学习，不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；要更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，不断地斗私批修，破私立公；要从毛主席著作中，从革命老工人身上，学习党的革命传统，学习工人阶级的优秀品质，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，增强无产阶级党性，坚决抵制和克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思想的影响，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业坚强可靠的接班人。
