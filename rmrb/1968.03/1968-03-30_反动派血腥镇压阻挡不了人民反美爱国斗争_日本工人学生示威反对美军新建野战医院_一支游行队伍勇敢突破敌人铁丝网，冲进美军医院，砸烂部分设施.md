Japanese Workers and Students Demonstrate Against New U.S. Army Field Hospital

A group of protesters bravely broke through the enemy's barbed wire and stormed into the U.S. Army hospital, destroying part of the facilities.

New China News Agency, March 29th – According to the Oriental News Agency: On the afternoon and evening of the 28th, 2,000 Japanese workers and patriotic students, with the support of numerous citizens, held a rally and demonstration in Tokyo. They continued to oppose the construction of a new field hospital by the U.S. military stationed in Japan and engaged in a very courageous struggle against the armed police who came to suppress them, dealing a powerful blow to U.S. imperialist policies.

In this struggle, one group of protesters bravely broke through the enemy's barbed wire, stormed into the U.S. Army field hospital, occupied part of the buildings, and destroyed some of the facilities before leaving.

Another group of protesters, along with more than 1,000 citizens, demonstrated in front of the main gate of the U.S. Army field hospital for two hours.

The Sato government, which willingly acts as a lackey of U.S. imperialism, dispatched 3,000 armed police. They used batons, armored vehicles, and tear gas to carry out a bloody suppression against the workers and students. Nearly 1,000 protesters were injured, and 179 were illegally arrested. The Japanese workers and students fought back bravely with great courage, continuing the struggle. A patriotic youth, beaten bloody by the police, still raised his arm and shouted, "Let us fight on to overthrow U.S. imperialism!"

The anti-American, patriotic actions of the workers and students received strong support from more than 20,000 citizens. They joined the protest march, surrounded the fascist police, and threw stones at them. During the counterattack, Japanese workers, students, and citizens seized a batch of batons from the police, destroyed several armored vehicles, and fought back so fiercely that the reactionary police were forced to retreat.

This anti-American, patriotic struggle continued until midnight.

Previously, people from various sectors of Japan had engaged in many brave struggles to oppose the construction of a new field hospital by the U.S. military stationed in Japan.

    反动派血腥镇压阻挡不了人民反美爱国斗争
    日本工人学生示威反对美军新建野战医院
    一支游行队伍勇敢突破敌人铁丝网，冲进美军医院，砸烂部分设施
    新华社二十九日讯 据东方通讯社报道：日本工人和爱国学生两千人二十八日下午和晚上在众多市民的支持下，在东京举行集会和示威游行，继续反对驻日美军新建野战医院，并同前来镇压他们的武装警察进行了十分英勇的斗争，给美帝侵略政策以有力打击。
    在这场斗争中，一支游行队伍勇敢地突破敌人的铁丝网，冲进美军野战医院，占领了一部分建筑物，砸烂了一部分设施，然后离去。
    另一支游行队伍同一千多名市民一道，在美军野战医院正门前进行了两小时的示威。
    甘心充当美帝走狗的佐藤政府，出动三千名武装警察，用警棍、装甲车和催泪瓦斯对工人和学生进行了血腥镇压。有近一千名示威者被打伤，有一百七十九名示威者被非法逮捕。日本工人和学生以大无畏的精神奋勇还击，坚持斗争。一位被警察打得血淋淋的爱国青年仍然振臂高呼：“让我们为打倒美帝而战斗下去！”
    工人和学生的这一反美爱国行动，得到了两万多市民的强有力支持。他们同示威队伍联合起来，把法西斯警察团团围住，并向警察投掷石头。在反击过程中，日本工人、学生和市民从警察手中夺下了一批警棍，砸毁了数辆装甲车，打得反动警察落花流水，最后被迫“退却”。
    这场反美爱国斗争一直进行到深夜十二点。
    在此以前，日本各界人民曾进行多次英勇斗争，反对驻日美军新建野战医院。
