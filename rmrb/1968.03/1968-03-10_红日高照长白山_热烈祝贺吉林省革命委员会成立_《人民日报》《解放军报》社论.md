In the charge towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, following the joyous news from the coast of the South China Sea, a thrilling victory song echoes from the majestic Mount Changbai: the Revolutionary Committee of Jilin Province has been established.

Currently, the area around Mount Changbai and the Songliao Plain is filled with a great situation. Under the intimate care of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jilin, the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Jilin Province have, through repeated struggles, smashed the various plots and tricks of the class enemy, exposed the traitors like Zhao Lin, who were agents of the Chinese Khrushchev within the party, and achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

We extend our warmest congratulations and highest respects to the revolutionary masses of Jilin Province and the 17 million people of various nationalities, and to all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jilin who have made great contributions during the Cultural Revolution!

The People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries" in Jilin Province has, in the process of thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, effectively implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue. They have helped revolutionary mass organizations to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought to comprehensively and historically examine cadres, enabling the broad revolutionary masses to correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, distinguishing between class enemies and internal contradictions among the people, promoting revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones, and promoting the birth of revolutionary committees.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, the party's political tasks cannot be completed."

We hope that after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Jilin Province, the work of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought will be placed at the forefront of all work. We must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and continue to vigorously run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, mobilize the masses, and thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, eliminating its poison in all aspects and thoroughly exposing the traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents in Jilin. The criticism must be sustained and thorough, and must not be relaxed. All revolutionary mass organizations must take the line of criticizing revisionism and combating selfishness as their guiding principle, strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, criticize anarchism, and continuously consolidate and develop revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones. We must do a good job in fighting, criticizing, and transforming in various units. The revolutionary committee is not a liaison station for various factions, but a temporary power organ of the dictatorship of the proletariat that combines the three-in-ones of the revolution. Not only the revolutionary leading cadres participating in the revolutionary committee, but also the representatives of various revolutionary mass organizations participating in the revolutionary committee, must not only represent one faction, but must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, represent the proletarian revolutionaries, represent the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and represent the broad revolutionary people.

Jilin Province is located on the front line of national defense and is an important industrial and agricultural production base in China. The military and civilians of Jilin Province bear heavy combat tasks. We hope that the Revolutionary Committee of Jilin Province will further implement Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," strengthen military-civilian unity, and rely on the People's Liberation Army and the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to strengthen revolutionary unity among all nationalities. We must strengthen the sense of enemy danger, heighten class vigilance, and resolutely expose and smash a handful of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who attempt to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction. If bad elements infiltrate the revolutionary mass organizations, they must be exposed and cleaned up by themselves. We must seriously implement the policy of our great leader Chairman Mao of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," and must ensure a double harvest of revolution and production.

The spring breeze blows over Mount Changbai, and red flags flutter along the Songhua River. We believe that the Revolutionary Committee of Jilin Province will continue to advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, with great enthusiasm and striving to be the best, leading the revolutionary people of the entire province to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and turn Jilin Province into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    红日高照长白山
    ——热烈祝贺吉林省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军号中，紧接着南海之滨欢呼革命委员会成立，从壮丽的长白山下又传来了激动人心的凯歌：吉林省革命委员会成立了。
    当前，长白山麓、松辽平原，一片大好形势。吉林省的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席的亲切关怀下，在人民解放军驻吉林部队大力支持下，经过反复较量，粉碎了阶级敌人种种阴谋诡计，揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫在吉林的代理人、大叛徒赵林等党内一小撮走资派，取得了无产阶级文化大革命决定性的胜利。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    我们谨向吉林省无产阶级革命派和一千七百万各族人民，谨向在文化大革命中作出巨大贡献的人民解放军驻吉林部队全体指战员，表示最热烈的祝贺和最崇高的敬意！
    战斗在吉林省“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军，在狠抓毛主席最新指示的全面落实过程中，有力地抓了毛主席关于干部问题最新指示的落实。他们通过帮助革命群众组织大办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想来全面地、历史地考察干部，使广大革命群众正确地执行了毛主席的干部政策，区别了敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，促进了革命委员会的诞生。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”
    我们希望吉林省革命委员会成立以后，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，继续大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，放手发动群众，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，从各方面肃清其流毒，把党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在吉林的代理人批臭、批透。大批判要坚持地持久地开展下去，决不能松懈。各个革命群众组织都要以斗私、批修为纲，加强无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，批判无政府主义，不断地巩固和发展革命的大联合、革命的三结合，大力搞好各单位的斗、批、改。革命委员会不是各派的联络站，而是革命三结合的无产阶级专政的临时权力机构。不但参加革命委员会的革命领导干部，要做坚持毛主席无产阶级革命路线的干部；参加革委会的各个革命群众组织的代表，也不能只做一派的代表，而要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，做无产阶级革命派的代表，做工人阶级、贫下中农的代表，做广大革命人民的代表。
    吉林省地处国防前线，是我国重要的工农业生产基地。吉林省的军民担负着重大的战斗任务。我们希望吉林省革命委员会进一步贯彻执行毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，大力加强军民团结。要坚决依靠人民解放军，依靠广大革命群众和革命干部，加强各民族的革命团结。要加强敌情观念，百倍提高阶级警惕，坚决揭露和粉碎一小撮企图破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏社会主义建设的叛徒、特务、反革命分子、死不悔改的走资派。各革命群众组织中如果混进了坏人，要自己加以揭发和清理。要认真执行我们伟大领袖毛主席关于抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备的方针，一定要把工农业生产抓好，保证革命和生产的双丰收。
    长白山下春风浩荡，松花江畔红旗如画。我们相信，吉林省革命委员会一定能沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线继续前进，鼓足干劲，力争上游，领导全省革命人民夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把吉林省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
