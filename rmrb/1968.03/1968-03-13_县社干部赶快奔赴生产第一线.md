The spring plowing season is upon us. To further implement the great directive of our great leader Chairman Mao, "grasp revolution, promote production," to do a good job in spring agricultural production, and to strive for an even greater harvest in 1968, it is of great significance for seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, for implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic plan of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," and for supporting the revolutionary struggles of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, the broad revolutionary masses of workers and peasants, and revolutionary cadres must be urgently mobilized. With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they must quickly launch a new high tide of mass spring agricultural production.

Readers from various places are very concerned about spring plowing and production. They have put forward many good suggestions from various angles. A few are selected and published here, hoping to draw the attention of relevant parties.

County and commune cadres should rush to the production frontline immediately. Currently, the countryside urgently needs county and commune cadres to go to the production frontline, help production brigades and production teams fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and do a good job in spring plowing and production to lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest this year. However, in our county, some county and commune cadres are still staying in the offices, not going deep into the spring plowing frontline, and even calling it "staying in the office to make revolution." Some people are selfish and dare not go down. We hope that the leading cadres at the county and commune levels will take immediate action, organize more revolutionary cadres to go to the production frontline, and together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, the broad community members, and the brigade and production team cadres, grasp the revolution and promote production, and create new merits for the people.

专栏：革命群众来信

    春耕大忙季节已到，进一步贯彻执行我们伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，搞好春季农业生产，力争一九六八年农业生产的更大丰收，对于夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，对于实现毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，对于支援越南人民和世界人民的革命斗争，都具有极其重大的意义。
    广大贫下中农，广大无产阶级革命派和革命干部，必须紧急动员起来，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，迅速掀起一个群众性的春季农业生产的新高潮。
    各地广大读者对春耕生产非常关心，他们从各个角度提出了许多很好的意见。现在选登几件，希望引起有关方面的注意。

    县社干部赶快奔赴生产第一线
    目前，农村迫切需要县社干部下到生产第一线，帮助生产大队和生产队全面落实毛主席的最新指示，搞好春耕生产，为夺取今年的大丰收打下良好基础。可是在我县，有的县、社干部，仍旧住在机关里，不深入春耕第一线，还美其名曰“留在机关闹革命”。有的人是“私”字当头，不敢下去。我们希望县社两级领导班子火速行动起来，组织更多的革命干部深入生产第一线，和广大贫下中农、广大社员一起，和大队、生产队干部一起，狠抓革命，猛促生产，为人民立新功。
