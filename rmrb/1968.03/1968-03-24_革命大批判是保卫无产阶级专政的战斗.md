The members of Huangshandong Production Brigade, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have strengthened their class struggle awareness and elevated revolutionary criticism to the level of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The criticism has deepened step by step, and the spiritual outlook has been renewed.

	The People's Liberation Army Guangdong Military Region's certain unit stationed in Boluo County, Shidian Commune, Huangshandong Production Brigade, has helped the broad masses of militiamen and commune members strengthen their class struggle awareness, elevated revolutionary criticism to the level of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, which has effectively promoted the spring plowing production of the entire brigade.

	The Huangshandong Production Brigade has been carrying out the revolutionary criticism movement for more than a year. The broad masses of militiamen and commune members, through exposing and criticizing the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Central China and Guangdong such as Tao Zhu, have deepened their class feelings towards the great teacher Chairman Mao, and pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high. However, some people think that after more than a year of revolutionary criticism, continuing to carry out criticism is like "beating a dead tiger" or "playing the flute to a deaf person—wasting effort." Some individual commune members, under the influence of a small handful of speculators in society, have again shown some selfish thoughts, indicating that the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism has not been thoroughly eliminated.

	The support team from the Guangdong Military Region's certain unit carefully analyzed these situations and, together with the broad masses of militiamen and commune members, explored a set of methods to carry out revolutionary criticism to the end in the midst of struggle.

	Correctly Understanding the Relationship Between Revolutionary Criticism and the Consolidation of Power

	Why do some militiamen and commune members have such wrong views on revolutionary criticism? The support team believes that the main reason is the lack of understanding of the struggle for "seizing power" and "counter-seizing power" in the ideological field, and the lack of understanding of the relationship between criticizing revisionism and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	They first presented China's Khrushchev's series of fallacies about restoring capitalism in the countryside, one by one, to the broad masses of militiamen and commune members, pointing out that its essence is to seize power from the proletariat and attempt to make the poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice. Then, they organized militiamen and commune members to recall and compare, to recognize the flesh-and-blood relationship between the poor and lower-middle peasants and the proletarian dictatorship, making everyone realize that criticizing revisionism is not about "beating a dead tiger" or "playing the flute to a deaf person," but about whether the proletarian dictatorship will be lost, whether the socialist mountains and rivers will change color, and whether the poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer twice.

	Next, they used the method of recalling and comparing to educate the broad masses of commune members and militiamen, further recognizing the relationship between criticizing revisionism and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, hating China's Khrushchev, hating the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, and hating the bourgeois reactionary line with the greatest hatred; loving our great teacher Chairman Mao, loving the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, and loving Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with the greatest love. Concentrating hatred on one point is to hate China's Khrushchev for attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism; concentrating love on one point is to love the revolutionary power created by our great teacher Chairman Mao. Thus, the broad masses of militiamen and commune members all regard revolutionary criticism as a battle to defend Chairman Mao and the dictatorship of the proletariat, investing the highest political enthusiasm and the greatest revolutionary vigor into this battle. From the village to the fields, from the cultural room to the home, everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. From the elderly in their seventies and eighties to children in their early teens, everyone has joined this battle.

	Correctly Handling the Relationship Between "Fighting Selfishness" and "Criticizing Revisionism"

	The support team also guided everyone to correctly handle the relationship between criticizing revisionism and fighting selfishness, placing the transformation of worldviews in the struggle of revolutionary criticism, achieving the goal of criticizing revisionist fallacies once, examining the "selfishness" in one's mind once, and launching an offensive against "selfishness" once. In practice, they called this method "look, compare, think." That is, look at how Chairman Mao advocates, compare how China's Khrushchev spreads poison, and think about how one does it. Clarifying the relationship between criticizing revisionism and fighting selfishness, achieving the purpose of educating and transforming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought. As a result, the self-awareness of the broad masses of militiamen and commune members in transforming their worldviews has reached an unprecedented height, and everyone must fight "selfishness" and criticize "revisionism" whenever they encounter something, becoming more enthusiastic the more they criticize and fight.

	During a criticism session of China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "four freedoms" in the Cao Dikeng Production Team, everyone spoke very enthusiastically. However, when team leader Liu Shengqun guided everyone to investigate the poison of "four freedoms" in the team, everyone felt there was nothing to investigate. Later, with the help of the support team, they quickly investigated the poison of "four freedoms" using the method of "look, compare, think." In 1962, this production team had a bumper harvest. Due to the poisoning of "four freedoms," the team distributed all the surplus of more than ninety baskets of rice to the commune members, and some people took it to the free market to sell. This encouraged the "selfishness" in the minds of the commune members. The criticism meeting of the Cao Dikeng Production Team became a meeting to investigate, fight, and break selfishness. The commune members deeply felt: Our great teacher Chairman Mao blocked the road to the restoration of capitalism, and China's Khrushchev used our "selfishness" to stealthily open the gap for the restoration of capitalism. If we are not vigilant against "selfishness," we will go astray on the path they lead us to. The support team and the broad masses of militiamen and commune members also created the method of "discussing one issue at a time." That is, when an issue arises, let the commune members fully discuss: What form does China's Khrushchev take to support the "selfishness" in people's minds. This approach is not limited by time and place, and discussions can be held on the way to work, during labor breaks, and in the fields, making the criticism of revisionism and the struggle against selfishness combine and deepen through various methods.

	Correctly Handling the Relationship Between "Criticism" and "Reform"

	The relationship between "criticism" and "reform" is the relationship between breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit. Chairman Mao said: "If you do not destroy these bad things, you cannot build.... Only by destroying the old and rotten things can you build new and healthy things." The facts are indeed like this. Although revolutionary criticism touches people's souls, because it has not paid attention to criticizing and destroying the "selfishness" in the old system, it has not fundamentally uprooted the breeding ground for "selfishness." Therefore, in many specific issues, "selfishness" still has a legal position. This is a "roadblock" for deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism. Correctly handling the relationship between "criticism" and "reform" is an important aspect of continuously deepening revolutionary criticism.

	The support team of Huangshandong Production Brigade deeply understood this, firmly grasped this, and carried out criticism and reform simultaneously, breaking and establishing simultaneously, fundamentally uprooting the breeding ground for "selfishness." Their approach is: Criticize one reactionary fallacy of China's Khrushchev, link it to the actual situation of the brigade, destroy one old thing, and establish one new system. For example, they criticized China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "material incentives" and linked it to the past situation of evaluating work and recording points in the brigade, abolished the old work-point system, and established the Dazhai-style political evaluation system that highlights Mao Zedong Thought.

	In the process of implementing this new system, they also encountered some ideological obstacles. The support team and the broad masses of commune members, through the method of recalling and comparing, removed the ideological obstacles to establishing the new system. They investigated the various poisons of the old work-point system, recalled the sweetness of emphasizing politics, and used living facts to criticize the harm of the fallacy of "material incentives." This promoted the reform of the old system, uprooted the breeding ground for "selfishness," and renewed the spirit of the commune members, doubling their enthusiasm.

	The deepening of revolutionary criticism has effectively promoted the spring plowing production movement of the brigade, with sowing, seedling raising, fertilizer accumulation, and land preparation activities being carried out vigorously.

    革命大批判是保卫无产阶级专政的战斗
    黄山洞大队社员在人民解放军帮助下增强阶级斗争观念，把革命大批判提到忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的高度，批判步步深入，精神面貌焕然一新
      本报讯　人民解放军广东省军区某部驻博罗县石坝公社黄山洞大队支农人员，帮助广大民兵和社员增强阶级斗争观念，把革命大批判提高到忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线的高度，深入开展革命大批判，有力地促进了全大队的春耕生产。
    黄山洞大队开展革命大批判运动已经一年多了。广大民兵和社员通过大揭、大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在中南和广东的代理人陶铸之流的罪行，更加加深了对伟大导师毛主席的阶级感情，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了新高潮。但是，有些人认为，革命大批判搞了一年多，继续开展批判是打“死老虎”，“给聋子吹笛——白费力气”；个别社员在社会上一小撮投机倒把分子的影响下，又出现了一些私心杂念，说明反革命修正主义流毒还没有彻底肃清。
    广东军区某部支农人员认真分析了这些情况，同广大民兵和社员一道，在斗争实践中摸索出了一套把革命大批判进行到底的办法。
      正确认识革命大批判和巩固政权的关系
    为什么一些民兵和社员对革命大批判会有那些错误看法？驻队支农人员认为，主要是对革命大批判这个在意识形态方面的“夺权”和“反夺权”斗争缺乏认识，对批判修正主义和巩固无产阶级政权的关系缺乏认识。
    他们首先把中国赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本主义的一系列谬论，一个一个地摆在广大民兵和社员的面前，指出它的本质就是向无产阶级夺权，妄图叫贫下中农吃二遍苦。然后，组织民兵和社员进行回忆对比，认清贫下中农同无产阶级政权的血肉关系，使大家认识到，批判修正主义，绝不是什么“打死老虎”“给聋子吹笛”，而是关系到无产阶级政权会不会丢失，社会主义江山会不会改变颜色，贫下中农会不会吃二遍苦的大问题。
    其次，他们又运用回忆对比的方法，教育广大社员和民兵，进一步认清批判修正主义和巩固无产阶级专政的关系，以最大的恨去恨中国赫鲁晓夫，恨反革命修正主义谬论，恨资产阶级反动路线；以最大的爱去爱我们伟大的导师毛主席，爱光焰无际的毛泽东思想，爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。把恨归结到一点上，就是恨中国赫鲁晓夫妄图颠覆无产阶级政权，复辟资本主义；把爱集中到一点上，就是爱我们伟大导师毛主席为我们创建的革命政权。从而，使广大民兵和社员都把革命的大批判当作保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级专政的一场战斗，以最高的政治热情，最大的革命干劲投入这场战斗。从村内到田头，从文化室到家庭，到处都是革命大批判的阵地。上至七、八十岁的老人，下至十一、二岁的小孩，都投入了这场战斗。
        正确处理“斗私”和“批修”的关系
    驻队支农人员又引导大家正确处理批修和斗私的关系，把世界观的改造摆到革命大批判的斗争中去，做到批判一次修正主义谬论，查一次头脑里的“私”字，向“私”字打一次进攻战。在实践中，他们把这个方法叫做“看一看，比一比，想一想”。即看一看毛主席是如何提倡的，比一比中国赫鲁晓夫是如何放毒的，想一想自己是如何做的。弄清批修和斗私的关系，达到用毛泽东思想教育自己、改造自己的目的。这样做的结果，广大民兵社员改造世界观的自觉性空前提高，大家遇事必斗“私”，必批“修”，越批越斗越有劲头。
    曹对坑生产队在一次批判中国赫鲁晓夫“四大自由”的谬论时，大家发言很热烈。但是，当队长刘胜群引导大家清查“四大自由”在本队的流毒时，大家就觉得没有什么可查。后来，他们在驻队支农人员的帮助下，运用“看一看，比一比，想一想”的办法，很快就把“四大自由”的流毒清查出来了。一九六二年，这个生产队获得了大丰收，由于受了“四大自由”的毒害，队里把节余的九十多担稻谷全部分给社员，有些人就拿到自由市场上去卖了。这样就助长了社员头脑里的“私”字。曹对坑生产队的这次批判会，成了一次查私、斗私、破私的大会。社员们深有所感地说：我们伟大导师毛主席堵死了复辟资本主义的道路，中国赫鲁晓夫又利用我们头脑里的“私”字偷偷摸摸地打开了复辟资本主义的缺口，如果我们对“私”字失去警惕，就会走到他们引诱的错路上去。驻队支农人员还和广大民兵和社员一道，创造了“一事一议”的方法。就是一事当前，让社员们充分议论：中国赫鲁晓夫是采取什么形式来扶持人们头脑里的“私”字。这种做法不受时间、地点的限制，上工路上，劳动间隙，田头地尾，都可以展开议论，使批修斗争通过多种方法同斗私活动结合起来，深入下去。
      正确处理“批”和“改”的关系
    “批”和“改”的关系，就是破私立公的关系。毛主席说：“不去破坏这些坏东西，你就休想建设。……只有破坏旧的腐朽的东西，才能建设新的健全的东西。”事实正是这样。革命的大批判虽然触及了人们的灵魂，但是由于没有注意批判和破坏旧制度上的“私”字，没有从根本上铲除产生“私”字的温床，所以，在许多具体问题上，“私”字仍然有合法的地位。这是深入开展革命大批判的“拦路虎”。正确处理好“批”和“改”的关系，是将革命大批判不断引向深入的一个重要方面。
    驻黄山洞大队支农人员深刻地认识了这一点，狠狠地抓住这一点，边批边改，边破边立，从根本上铲除“私”字的温床。他们的做法是：批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反动谬论，联系本大队的实际，破坏一个旧的东西，建立一个新的制度。比如，他们批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“物质刺激”谬论，便联系了本大队过去评工记分的情况，破除了旧的记工制度，建立了大寨式的突出毛泽东思想的政治评分制。
    在执行这个新的制度的过程中，也曾经遇到一些思想障碍。驻队支农人员和广大社员，又通过回忆对比的办法，扫除建立新制度的思想障碍。查出了旧的记工制度的各种流毒，回忆了突出政治的甜头，用活生生的事实批判了“物质刺激”谬论的危害。促进了旧制度的改革，铲除了“私”字的温床，社员精神面貌一新，干劲倍增。
    革命大批判的深入发展，有力地推动了这个大队的春耕生产运动，播种、育秧、积肥、整地活动搞得热气腾腾。
