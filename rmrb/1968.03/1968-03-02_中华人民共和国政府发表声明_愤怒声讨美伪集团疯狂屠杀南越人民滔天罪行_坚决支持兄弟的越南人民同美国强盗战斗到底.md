The heroic South Vietnamese people's New Year offensive has left the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries around the world in a state of panic and despair, feeling the terror of impending doom. The U.S. imperialists' indiscriminate bombing of South Vietnamese cities has exposed the savage nature of imperialism and is a sign of their desperate struggle. All revolutionary peoples around the world stand with the Vietnamese people. The final victory will undoubtedly belong to the heroic Vietnamese people.

		New China News Agency, March 1st: The Chinese government issued a statement today, strongly condemning the recent brutal massacres of South Vietnamese city residents by U.S. imperialism and its puppet regime in South Vietnam, reaffirming China's government and 700 million Chinese people's full support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation. The full text of the statement is as follows:

		Statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China
		March 1, 1968

		The U.S. imperialists and their puppets, who have been severely beaten in the heroic South Vietnamese people's New Year offensive, have recently carried out a frenzied massacre of the South Vietnamese people, especially city residents. They used aircraft and artillery to bomb cities such as Saigon, Hue, and Da Nang, and even used poison gas, napalm, and phosphorus shells to kill countless urban and rural people. On February 15th and 25th, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued statements, strongly condemning the fascist atrocities of the U.S. puppet regime, and reaffirming the unyielding resolve of the 31 million heroic Vietnamese people to fight to the end against U.S. imperialism and its puppets. The Chinese government and 700 million Chinese people firmly support the just stance of the Vietnamese people, and strongly condemn the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese puppets.

		Since the beginning of this year, the South Vietnamese military and people have launched a powerful and fierce offensive on the South Vietnamese battlefield, demonstrating the immense power of people's war, and achieving unprecedented heavy blows against U.S. imperialism and its puppets, resulting in stunning victories that have shocked the world. The great victory of the South Vietnamese people has brought joy and encouragement to all revolutionary peoples around the world; imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries worldwide are in a state of panic and despair. The American aggressors, who were recently still pretending to be calm and arrogant, now feel the terror of impending doom.

		However, as our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "All reactionary forces, when they are on the verge of extinction, will always make desperate struggles. They will inevitably resort to various military adventures and political deceptions to save themselves from extinction." The American aggressors, facing imminent doom, have not abandoned their evil plans to invade Vietnam. On the one hand, they are hurriedly recruiting cannon fodder, calling up reserves, continuing to send more invasion troops to South Vietnam, and intensifying their bombing of North Vietnam; on the other hand, they are conspiring with the Soviet revisionist leadership to plot various peace talks. The recent savage massacres and persecutions of South Vietnamese city residents by the U.S. puppet regime are also a manifestation of the U.S. imperialists' desperate struggles.

		U.S. imperialism has already fallen into an extremely difficult situation in South Vietnam, surrounded by enemies on all sides. The cities they once considered safe have now become direct battlefields for striking them; the bases they once relied on to invade Vietnam have now become their own graves. The U.S. imperialists' indiscriminate bombing of South Vietnamese cities, on the one hand, exposes the savage nature of imperialism, and on the other hand, also indicates that their days of complete failure in Vietnam are not far off.

		Currently, the situation in the Vietnamese war of resistance against American aggression is excellent. The Vietnamese people's final victory is in sight. The great leader of the Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh, said well: "The closer to victory, the more difficulties there will be. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will struggle even more desperately. Therefore, our military and people must strengthen their unity, persist in the fight, fight hard, and fight continuously to achieve greater victories." Now, the 31 million Vietnamese people are responding to President Ho Chi Minh's call to arms, with unshakable belief in victory, overcoming all difficulties, fearing no hardships or sacrifices, and fighting more bravely for the complete victory of the war of resistance against American aggression. The Chinese people, with deep admiration, fully support the Vietnamese people. All revolutionary peoples around the world stand with the Vietnamese people. We firmly believe that no matter how desperately the U.S. imperialists struggle, they will never be able to stop the Vietnamese people's march to victory. The final victory will undoubtedly belong to the heroic Vietnamese people.

    中华人民共和国政府发表声明
    愤怒声讨美伪集团疯狂屠杀南越人民滔天罪行
    坚决支持兄弟的越南人民同美国强盗战斗到底
    越南南方军民新春大捷，使帝修反惊慌失措，垂头丧气，感到末日来临的恐惧。美帝对越南南方城市居民的狂轰滥炸，暴露了帝国主义的凶残本性，是美帝垂死挣扎的表现。全世界一切革命人民，都站在越南人民一边。最后胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民。
    新华社一日讯　中华人民共和国政府一日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其南越走狗最近野蛮屠杀越南南方城市居民的滔天罪行，重申中国政府和七亿中国人民全力支援兄弟的越南人民的抗美救国战争。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府声明
                                一九六八年三月一日
    在英雄的越南南方人民新春强大攻势中被打得焦头烂额的美帝国主义及其走狗，最近对越南南方人民，特别是城市居民进行了疯狂的屠杀。他们使用飞机大炮对西贡、顺化、岘港等城市进行狂轰滥炸，甚至使用毒气、凝固汽油弹、磷质炮弹杀害广大的城乡人民。二月十五日和二十五日，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南民主共和国政府分别发表声明，强烈控诉美伪集团的法西斯暴行，重申三千一百万英雄的越南人民不怕任何牺牲，誓与美帝国主义及其走狗战斗到底的坚强决心。中国政府和七亿中国人民坚决支持兄弟的越南人民的这一严正立场，愤怒声讨美帝国主义及其南越走狗的滔天罪行。
    今年新春以来，越南南方军民在越南南方战场上全面出击，发动了强大凌厉的攻势，发挥人民战争的无比威力，空前沉重地打击了美帝国主义及其走狗，取得震惊世界的辉煌战果。越南南方人民的这一伟大胜利，使世界上一切革命人民欢欣鼓舞；帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派惊慌失措，垂头丧气。不久前还在强作镇静、神气活现的美国侵略者，现在也感到末日来临的恐惧。
    但是，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的，“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。他们必然要采取军事冒险和政治欺骗的种种手段，来挽救自己的灭亡。”面临灭顶之灾的美国侵略者，仍然没有放弃侵略越南的罪恶计划。它一方面加紧搜罗炮灰，征召后备兵员，继续向越南南方增派侵略军队，加强对越南北方的轰炸；同时，又伙同苏联修正主义领导集团策划种种和谈阴谋。最近美伪集团对越南南方城市居民的野蛮屠杀和迫害，也正是美帝国主义进行垂死挣扎的一种表现。
    美帝国主义在越南南方已经陷入四面楚歌、空前困难的境地。过去他们认为最安全的城镇，如今已成为直接打击他们的战场；过去他们赖以向越南人民进行侵略的据点，如今已变成埋葬他们自己的坟墓。美帝国主义对越南南方城市居民的狂轰滥炸，一方面表现了帝国主义凶残本性，另一方面也说明它在越南彻底失败的日子不会很远了。
    当前，越南抗美救国战争的形势一片大好。越南人民的最后胜利已经看得见了。越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席说得好：“越接近胜利，困难将会越多。敌人就象一头走投无路的野兽，将更加疯狂地挣扎。因此，我们军民更要加强团结，坚持战斗，狠狠地打，连续地打，以夺取更大的胜利。”现在，三千一百万越南人民正在响应胡志明主席的战斗号召，以必胜的信念，排除一切困难，不怕艰苦牺牲，为争取抗美救国战争的彻底胜利而更加英勇的战斗。中国人民怀着无比敬佩的心情，全力支援兄弟的越南人民。全世界一切革命的人民，都站在越南人民的一边。我们坚信，不管美帝国主义怎样进行垂死的挣扎，都绝对不能阻挡越南人民的胜利前进，最后胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民。
