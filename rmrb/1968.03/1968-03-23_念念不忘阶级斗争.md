The establishment of the revolutionary committees is a victory for the revolutionary masses in their struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. It is a great revolution of one class overthrowing another, and a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The overthrown class enemies will not give up. They are always plotting to stage a comeback and are constantly trying to restore the old order. If we only hear the sound of victory celebrations and fail to see the harsh reality of class struggle behind it, we will suffer great losses, and the fruits of victory may be lost.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come out to applaud us." "There may be some Communists who have never been defeated by armed enemies; they are heroes in the face of these enemies. But they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets; they will be defeated in the face of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation."

Traitors, spies, and a handful of die-hard capitalist roaders within the Party, as well as landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed in society, find it increasingly difficult to openly oppose the revolutionary committees. With the changing situation, they often change their tactics: either they try to infiltrate the new revolutionary power, or they use sugar-coated bullets and counter-revolutionary economism to lure our people down, or they appear in an ultra-leftist guise, taking up revolutionary slogans, deceiving people, and confusing class lines, or they gather their trusted followers and place them within the revolutionary ranks as their agents, or they incite factional struggles among revolutionary mass organizations, foment anarchism, and disrupt the revolution and production, or they spread a black wind, denying the revolutionary mass movement and the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution, and so on. However, no matter what tricks these class enemies use, whether they are "left" or right, their targets are always the proletarian headquarters, the People's Liberation Army, and the new revolutionary committees.

Our comrades must not be naive and oversimplify the complex class struggle.

The revolutionary committees were born in the midst of fierce class struggle. They are also the command centers leading the broad revolutionary masses to attack the class enemies. The revolutionary committees should lead the broad revolutionary masses to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to carry out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, to always direct the spearhead of the struggle at the main enemy, and to continuously attack the class enemies. Only in this way can the revolutionary committees be continuously consolidated and their proletarian authority continuously enhanced.

We must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to emphasize proletarian politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    念念不忘阶级斗争
    本报评论员
    革命委员会的成立，是无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资派夺权斗争的胜利，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的大革命的胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。
      被推翻了的阶级敌人决不会死心，决不会睡大觉。他们的黑心眼，总是在谋算着翻案，每日每时企图复辟。如果我们只听到欢庆胜利的锣鼓声，看不到这种锣鼓声背后的严酷的阶级斗争的现实，我们就会吃大亏，胜利的果实就有丧失的危险。
    毛主席教导我们：“因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。”“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”
    混入革命队伍内部的叛徒、特务，党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派，以及社会上没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，他们明火执仗地反对革命委员会，是越来越困难了。随着形势的变化，他们常常改变自己的策略：或者削尖脑袋，钻进新生的革命政权里面来；或者施放糖衣炮弹，用反革命经济主义等手段，把我们的人拉下水；或者以极“左”的面目出现，接过革命的口号，到处招摇撞骗，搅乱阶级阵线；或者收罗心腹，安插在革命队伍内部，充当他们的代理人；或者挑起革命群众组织之间的派别斗争，煽动无政府主义，破坏抓革命、促生产；或者大刮黑风，否定革命群众运动，否定文化大革命的伟大成果，等等。但是，不管这些阶级敌人变换什么花样，“左”的还是右的，矛头都是对准无产阶级司令部，对准人民解放军，对准新生的革命委员会。
    对于这种情况，我们的同志“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”
    革命委员会是在激烈的阶级斗争中诞生的。它又是领导广大革命群众向阶级敌人进攻的战斗指挥部。革命委员会应当领导广大革命群众，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，持久地深入地开展革命大批判，始终把斗争的锋芒指向主要敌人，不停顿地对阶级敌人展开进攻。只有这样，革命委员会才能不断地得到巩固，不断地提高自己的无产阶级权威。
    我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗！
