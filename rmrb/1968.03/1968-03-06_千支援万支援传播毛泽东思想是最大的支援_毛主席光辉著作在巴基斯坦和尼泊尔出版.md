The brilliant works of Chairman Mao have recently been translated into the two main national languages of Pakistan, Urdu and Bengali, and published across the country, receiving a warm welcome from the Pakistani people.

The Karachi Publishers recently published seven single-volume works of Chairman Mao in Urdu, collecting twelve of Chairman Mao's brilliant works: "Reform Our Study," "The Situation After the Second Counter-Revolutionary Wave Has Been Repelled," "Summary of the Struggle Against the Second Counter-Revolutionary Wave," "Some Problems of Leadership Method," "Organize," "Several Important Problems in the Current Policy of the Party," "The May Fourth Movement," "Absorb a Large Number of Intellectuals," "The United Front in Cultural Work," "The Problem of Independence Within the United Front," "Unite All Anti-Japanese Forces, Oppose the Anti-Communist Diehards," and "The Problem of Political Power in the Anti-Japanese Base Areas."

Each single-volume work includes a portrait of Chairman Mao with the caption: "The Lenin of Today—Mao Zedong."

Two more brilliant works of Chairman Mao, "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "How to Analyze the Classes in Rural Areas," have recently been translated into Bengali and published in Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan.

The important article by Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, "Long Live the Victory of People's War," has also been translated into Urdu and published in Lahore, the capital of West Pakistan.

At a book exhibition held in Lahore in February, Chairman Mao's brilliant works received high praise from the Pakistani people. Many visitors eagerly purchased the red treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" at the bookstall.

A Pakistani friend pointed out: "Spreading the great Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest internationalist aid that China provides to the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa. This is more important than any material aid given to the peoples of Asia and Africa."

The brilliant work of the great leader Chairman Mao, "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," has recently been translated into Nepali by the President of the Nepal-China Friendship Association, Purna Bahadur, and published by the association in Kathmandu.

Other brilliant works of Chairman Mao, "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," have also been translated into Nepali and published in Kathmandu.
