On the eve of Zimbabwe Day (March 17), the cry of "Overthrow the Smith colonial regime" is echoing across the entire African continent. The recent bloody massacre of Zimbabwean freedom fighters by the fascist regime of South Rhodesia, backed by American and British imperialism, has sparked immense outrage and strong condemnation from the revolutionary people of the world. The situation is increasingly favorable for the armed struggle of the Zimbabwean people. Since the illegal declaration of "independence" by the white colonialist regime of Smith in November 1965, with the support and encouragement of American and British imperialism, the 4.5 million African people of Zimbabwe have been plunged into even deeper misery.

However, where there is oppression, there is resistance; where there is exploitation, there is struggle. In February 1966, the gunshots of people's armed struggle rang out on the heroic land of Zimbabwe. Over the past two years, the flames of armed struggle have burned brighter and brighter. The brave Zimbabwean freedom fighters are not only active in the dense forests but also frequently appear on the transportation lines. They lay mines, blow up bridges, punish colonialists, and ambush white colonial troops. Last year, in a series of ambushes, they eliminated hundreds of colonial troops. This year, Zimbabwean freedom fighters have intensified their guerrilla activities. In just five days in February, they killed about fifty enemy soldiers and wounded many more. The guerrilla areas of the Zimbabwean people's armed forces are gradually expanding from the north to the south.

The armed struggle of the Zimbabwean people has made the white colonialists panic-stricken and see danger in every bush. It is reported that Smith has built a ten-foot-high "security wall" around his residence as a protective measure. Special safety glass has also been installed between the viewing gallery and the debating hall in the "parliament."

To prop up its colonial rule and protect American and British interests in South Rhodesia, the Smith colonial regime has imposed even more brutal repression on the Zimbabwean people. Despite worldwide condemnation, it has colluded with American and British imperialism to kill five Zimbabwean freedom fighters on March 6 and 11.

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are exactly such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote more extensive, more violent revolutions."

The atrocities of the Smith colonial regime have not intimidated the Zimbabwean people but have instead fueled their deep hatred and strengthened their resolve to seize their guns and wage a broader armed struggle. The Zimbabwean people solemnly declare: "No matter how tortuous the road to liberation is, no matter how great the difficulties encountered, the Zimbabwean people are determined to persist in a protracted armed struggle until white colonialism is completely eliminated in Zimbabwe." They point out: "Zimbabwe will become the graveyard for all those who support Smith and his executioner clique."

The broad masses of Zimbabwean freedom fighters and African nationalists are increasingly aware that American and British imperialism are the backers of the Smith colonial regime, the chief culprits behind the massacre of Zimbabwean people. Some African nationalist organizations here have issued statements pointing out that American and British imperialism must bear full responsibility for the brutal slaughter of Zimbabwean fighters.

Facing the favorable situation at home, the Zimbabwean freedom fighters are more confident in their armed struggle. On the eve of Zimbabwe Day, the chief representative of the Zimbabwe African National Union here, Chihuta, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that through several years of struggle, the Zimbabwean people have deeply believed in Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." "Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory—this is the logic of the people. They will also never deviate from this logic." Chihuta emphasized: "We have made up our minds to struggle and win independence through armed struggle. We will definitely win." Another Zimbabwean freedom fighter clearly stated: "We cannot imagine begging for independence from Britain or the United Nations, the tool of American imperialism. We understand that only through armed struggle can we achieve victory."

　　有压迫就有反抗　有剥削就有斗争
　　津巴布韦人民决心坚持武装斗争推翻殖民政权
　　人民武装斗争不断发展，殖民主义者惊惶失措草木皆兵
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆十六日电　在津巴布韦日（三月十七日）的前夕，“打倒史密斯殖民政权”的怒吼声正在响遍整个非洲大陆。得到美英帝国主义支持的南罗得西亚法西斯政权最近血腥屠杀津巴布韦自由战士的滔天罪行，激起了全世界革命人民的无比愤怒和强烈谴责。形势的发展，对津巴布韦人民的武装斗争越来越有利。自从一九六五年十一月史密斯白人殖民主义当局在美英帝国主义的支持和纵容下非法宣布“独立”以来，四百五十万津巴布韦非洲人民被投入了更深的悲惨的深渊。
    但是，有压迫就有反抗，有剥削就有斗争。一九六六年二月，在津巴布韦的英雄土地上响起了人民武装斗争的枪声。两年来，武装斗争的火焰越烧越旺。英勇的津巴布韦自由战士不仅活跃在茂密的丛林中，而且经常出没在交通线上。他们埋地雷，炸桥梁，惩罚殖民主义者，伏击白人殖民军。他们去年在一系列的伏击中，消灭了几百名殖民军。今年以来，津巴布韦自由战士更加紧了游击活动，仅仅在二月份的五天之内，就打死敌军约五十名，打伤多名。津巴布韦人民武装的游击区正在逐步从北部扩大到南部。
    津巴布韦人民的武装斗争使白人殖民主义者惊惶失措，草木皆兵。据报道，史密斯在他的住所周围筑了一道十英尺高的“保安墙”，作为保护措施。在“议会”的旁听席和辩论厅之间还安装了特别的保险玻璃。
    史密斯殖民政权为了支撑它的殖民统治和保护美英在南罗得西亚的利益，对津巴布韦人民实行了更加野蛮的镇压。它不顾世界舆论的谴责，勾结美英帝国主义，在三月六日和十一日杀害了五名津巴布韦自由战士。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    史密斯殖民政权的暴行不但没有吓倒津巴布韦人民，反而增加了他们对敌人的深仇大恨，增强了他们紧握手中枪、更广泛地开展武装斗争的决心。津巴布韦人民庄严宣布：“解放的道路不管有多么曲折，遇到的困难不管有多大，津巴布韦人民决心坚持持久的武装斗争，直到在津巴布韦彻底消灭白人殖民主义者为止。”他们指出：“津巴布韦将成为一切拥护史密斯和他的刽子手集团的人的坟场。”
    广大的津巴布韦自由战士和非洲民族主义者越来越清楚地认识到，美英帝国主义是史密斯殖民当局的后台老板，是杀害津巴布韦人民的罪魁祸首。这里的一些非洲民族主义组织发表声明严正指出，美英帝国主义必须对残酷屠杀津巴布韦战士承担全部责任。
      津巴布韦自由战士面对国内的有利形势，对他们的武装斗争更加充满信心。津巴布韦非洲民族联盟驻这里的首席代表契胡塔在津巴布韦日的前夕对新华社记者说，津巴布韦人民通过几年的斗争，更加深信毛主席的伟大教导：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑，他们也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。”契胡塔强调说：“我们已下定决心进行斗争，通过武装斗争赢得独立。我们一定会胜利。”另一位津巴布韦自由战士明确指出：“我们决不能设想向英国或美帝国主义的工具联合国乞求独立。我们懂得，只有通过武装斗争，才能取得胜利。”
