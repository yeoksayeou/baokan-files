I once again saw our heart's reddest sun, Chairman Mao. This is the greatest happiness and greatest honor of my life. I shed tears of joy and shouted a thousand and ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!"

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The hearts of the railway soldiers are forever with you. When the red sun rises in the east, we think of you, for it is you who led the Chinese people through long, arduous struggles to overthrow the three big mountains and establish New China. When we hold your red book, we think of you, for your brilliant thoughts have armed the Chinese people and revolutionaries worldwide, ensuring the downfall of all reactionaries. When we raise the red flag and enter the construction site, we think of you, for you taught us: "The People's Liberation Army should be a great school," "Grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness." People change their thoughts, and the landscape changes.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The high Xingan Mountains cannot block the boundless love of the railway soldiers for you, and the long Songhua River cannot sever the boundless loyalty of the railway soldiers to you! We write your teachings on the construction site, guiding us through the vast forest to build roads; we hang your portrait in the tent, warming our hearts day and night; we carry your red revolutionary book with us, keeping a red sun in our hearts that never sets.

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." We are building roads in the northeastern forest area to open up the country's "green treasure trove." Here, the land is frozen for thousands of miles, and the climate is harsh, known as the "high-cold forbidden zone." The railway soldiers, with boundless loyalty to you, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have swept away the rolling cold currents and melted the thousand-year-old ice and snow. In the deep forest, we have built iron roads and trained a batch of successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat, achieving double victories in ideology and road construction.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! In the struggle against class enemies and nature, it is your brilliant sunlight that guides our growth. It is your brilliant thoughts that nurtured me from a poor peasant's son into a revolutionary soldier. Over the years, I have deeply felt that having a red sun in my heart means no obstacles on the road ahead. When a tunnel collapsed unexpectedly, endangering the lives of my comrades, it was your brilliant thoughts that guided me to rescue my comrades from the danger zone. After being injured and hospitalized, it was your brilliant thoughts that gave me endless strength to overcome the pain of injury. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it was your brilliant thoughts that guided me forward, turning the hospital ward into a battlefield, picking up the pen as a weapon, and resolutely fighting against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your brilliance surpasses the sun, and your kindness is deeper than the ocean. Following you gives us direction, following you means victory.

Most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, your reception is the greatest care, greatest encouragement, and greatest inspiration for us railway soldiers. I am determined, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," to study and apply your latest series of instructions thoroughly, to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" thoroughly, to transform my worldview thoroughly, and to forever follow you, to defend you with my life, with unwavering loyalty.

    永远紧跟毛主席  赤胆忠心志不移
    铁道兵硬骨头战士  张春玉
    我又一次见到我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，这是我一生中最大最大的幸福，最大最大的光荣。我流着幸福的眼泪，千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们铁道兵战士的颗颗红心永远向着您。当一轮红日从东方升起，我们想念您，是您领导中国人民经过长期的艰苦卓绝的斗争，推翻了三座大山，建立了新中国；当手捧起您的红色宝书，我们想念您，是您的光辉思想武装了中国和全世界革命人民，使国内外一切反动派都逃不脱覆灭的命运。当我们高举红旗走进工地，我们想念您，是您教导我们：“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”，“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备。”人换思想，山河变貌。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！高高的兴安岭挡不住铁道兵战士对您的无限热爱，长长的松花江截不断铁道兵战士对您的无限忠诚！我们把您的谆谆教导写在工地上，茫茫林海筑路有方向；我们把您的画像挂在帐篷里，阳光日夜暖心房；我们把您的红色革命宝书揣在身上，心中有颗永远不落的红太阳。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。我们在东北林区为打开祖国“绿色的宝库”修路，这里冰封千里，气候严寒，被人们称作“高寒禁区”。无限忠于您的铁道兵战士，怀着对您的一颗赤胆忠心，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，扫开了滚滚寒流，溶化了千年冰雪，在密林深处修建了一条条钢铁大道，锻炼了一批批无产阶级革命事业的接班人，获得了思想、修路双胜利。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在向阶级敌人和向大自然的斗争中，都是您的灿烂阳光，照耀我们成长。是您的光辉思想，把我从一个贫苦农民的儿子哺育成为一个革命战士。几年来，我深深地体会到，心中有颗红太阳，前进路上无阻挡。在隧道发生意外塌方，战友生命受到严重威胁的危急时刻，是您光辉的思想指挥我把战友救出了险区；我负伤住院后，是您的光辉思想给了我无穷的力量，战胜了伤残剧痛；在无产阶级文化大革命中，又是您的光辉思想指引我继续向前，把病房当战场，拿起笔作刀枪，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派进行坚决的斗争。毛主席啊，毛主席！您的光辉胜过太阳，您的恩情深过海洋，跟着您就有方向，跟着您就是胜利。
    最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席啊，您的接见是对我们铁道兵战士最大的关怀，最大的鞭策，最大的鼓舞。我决心以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，努力学好用好您的一系列最新指示，彻底地“斗私，批修”，彻底地改造世界观，永远紧跟您，誓死保卫您，赤胆忠心志不移。
