A new wave of selling dollars and pounds and buying gold has swept through the financial centers of Western Europe in recent days, delivering another severe blow to the shaky capitalist world monetary system. This is the third major gold-buying frenzy in just over three months since the devaluation of the pound on November 18 last year. The frequent occurrence of gold-buying frenzies is a dangerous sign that the capitalist world's financial and monetary system is accelerating towards collapse.

This round of gold-buying frenzy began last week. First, the prices of gold mining stocks surged, followed by a growing wave of selling dollars and pounds and buying gold in the gold markets of London, Paris, and other Western European countries. In London, the trading volume on the gold market reached an estimated 40 to 50 tons on March 1, nearly tripling the previous day's volume; the demand for gold reached its highest point since the unprecedented gold-buying frenzy triggered by the devaluation of the pound last year. The buying spree also extended to silver and other precious metals. The result of selling dollars and pounds and buying gold caused the exchange rates of the dollar and pound to drop significantly in the foreign exchange markets of various Western European countries; the pound's exchange rate in the London market has fallen to its lowest point since the devaluation. Western financial circles are anxiously predicting that the gold-buying frenzy will continue to expand.

The direct trigger for this gold-buying frenzy is the widespread rumor in Western Europe last week that the United States is about to ban the outflow of gold, causing dollar holders to panic and rush to exchange their dollars for gold to avoid losses. However, the fundamental reason is the deepening of the currency crisis in the Western world. So far this year, the United States has continued to see a huge deficit in its international balance of payments, with gold reserves falling to their lowest point in 31 years, making the dollar's position even more precarious; the devaluation of the pound has so far failed to pull Britain's finances and economy out of unprecedented dire straits. Additionally, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen, which are closely linked to the dollar, are currently facing significant difficulties, with rumors of their devaluation rife. If they are forced to devalue, it will undoubtedly trigger a severe chain reaction in the capitalist world. All of this has deepened the unease of financial circles in Western countries about the future. The resurgence of the gold-buying frenzy indicates a lack of confidence in the West's belief in the U.S. economy's ability to continue to support the dollar as the pillar of the capitalist world monetary system and maintain its privileged position.

In its commentary on the 2nd, the Paris Figaro wrote bluntly: "Despite repeated solemn statements by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, no one believes he will use the last gram of gold stored in Fort Knox (the U.S. gold reserve) to defend the current dollar-gold parity." The same day, the British Guardian acknowledged in its editorial that this new gold-buying frenzy reflects the ongoing crisis in the (Western) world's financial system. The newspaper expressed concern that the further deepening of the current currency crisis in the Western world could lead to a major economic crisis sweeping the entire capitalist world.

### 资本主义世界货币危机日益加深  西欧抢购黄金风潮再起  伦敦巴黎等黄金市场上争相抛售美元英镑

    资本主义世界货币危机日益加深
    西欧抢购黄金风潮再起
    伦敦巴黎等黄金市场上争相抛售美元英镑
    新华社三日讯　一股抛售美元英镑、抢购黄金的新浪潮连日来席卷西欧各金融中心，使得风雨飘摇的资本主义世界货币制度遭到了又一次猛烈的冲击。这是自从去年十一月十八日英镑贬值以来，在短短三个多月里，西方世界接连爆发的第三次大规模抢购黄金风潮。黄金抢风频繁发生是资本主义世界金融货币体系加速走向崩溃的一个危险信号。
    这次黄金抢风开始于上周初。先是金矿股票的价格急剧上涨，接着在伦敦、巴黎等西欧国家黄金市场，都出现了规模越来越大的抛售美元英镑、抢购黄金的风潮。在伦敦，三月一日这一天黄金市场上的成交量据估计达到了四十吨至五十吨之间，比前一天几乎增加三倍；市场上对黄金的需求量达到了自从去年英镑贬值所触发的那次空前规模黄金抢风以来的最高峰。抢购的范围还扩大到了白银和其他贵重金属。抛售美元英镑、抢购黄金的结果，在西欧各国的外汇市场上，美元和英镑的牌价显著下降；伦敦市场上英镑的牌价已经跌到了贬值以来的最低点。西方金融界人士惴惴不安地预言，黄金抢风还将继续扩大。
    触发这次黄金抢风的直接原因是西欧上周盛传美国即将禁止黄金流出美国，弄得美元持有者惶惶不安，都想尽早把手中的美元换成黄金，以免到时遭受损失。但是根本原因则是西方世界货币危机的进一步加深。今年以来，美国的国际收支继续出现巨额逆差，黄金储备降到了三十一年来的最低点，美元地位更加岌岌可危；英镑贬值迄今并没有能使英国财政经济从空前严重的困境中挣脱出来；另外，同美元有着密切联系的加拿大元和日元目前也遭到很大困难，有关加元和日元贬值的传说甚嚣尘上，一旦它们被迫贬值，必将在资本主义世界引起极其严重的连锁反应。这一切都加深了西方国家金融界人士对前景的不安。黄金抢风的再起，表明西方世界对美国经济是否有能力使美元继续充当资本主义世界货币体系的支柱并维持其特权地位，十分缺乏信心。
    巴黎《费加罗报》在二日的评论中直截了当地写道：“尽管美国财政部长一再发表庄严声明，但是没有一个人相信他真会用尽诺克斯堡（美国黄金金库）里储存的最后一克黄金，来保卫当前美元（对黄金）的比价。”英国的《卫报》同一天在社论中承认，这次新的黄金抢风反映了（西方）世界金融制度中连绵不断的危机。这家报纸表示担心，当前西方世界货币危机的进一步深化会导致一次遍及整个资本主义世界的经济大危机。
