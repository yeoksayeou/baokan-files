The revolutionary committees of Hebei, Guangdong, and Qinghai provinces have called on the broad revolutionary masses to carry forward the spirit of hard work and simplicity, and to swiftly launch a mass movement to increase production, increase income, oppose waste, and practice thrift.

The revolutionary committee of Hebei Province recently held a standing committee meeting. The participants repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "We must further economize to make revolution," and decided to focus on class struggle, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction, and swiftly launch a mass movement to increase production, increase income, oppose waste, and practice thrift.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must further economize to make revolution." The participants in the meeting unanimously pointed out during the study of this great instruction that Chairman Mao's great instruction is not merely an economic issue but is a component of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and a new battle cry for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All levels of revolutionary committees, local military support units, and revolutionary mass organizations must act swiftly and decisively to fight this political battle in the economic realm.

The meeting emphasized that the current situation in the entire province is excellent and is getting better. The great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing more broadly and deeply than ever before. Revolution has liberated the productive forces. Agricultural production achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest last year, industrial production is thriving, and socialist construction has entered a new leap-forward stage. However, class struggle remains sharp and complex. Corrupting from an economic standpoint is an important form of the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat at present.

The meeting cited numerous facts to prove that economizing to make revolution, opposing extravagance and waste, and resisting the bourgeoisie's counterrevolutionary economic wind are important aspects of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. It is a major issue for the proletarian revolutionary faction to prevent revisionism and to hold and use power well. We must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and thoroughly eliminate the poison of counterrevolutionary economism. We must overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism. Only by focusing on class struggle can we fully implement Chairman Mao's great instruction, "We must further economize to make revolution."

During the discussion, everyone emphasized that whether we can persist in economizing to make revolution is a test of our loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the great thought of Mao Zedong, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is a test of whether we can fight this political battle in the economic realm. All levels of revolutionary committees, local military support units, and revolutionary mass organizations must set an example in implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction and achieve new successes in seizing the revolution and promoting production. At the same time, the meeting also required all regions and departments to address the living thoughts in economizing to make revolution, hold Mao Zedong thought study classes, and make Chairman Mao's great instruction known to every household, turning it into the conscious action of the broad revolutionary masses.

The meeting also made corresponding decisions on how to fully implement Chairman Mao's great instruction, "We must further economize to make revolution."

Currently, a new high tide of a mass movement to increase production and practice thrift is surging across the entire province. Many organs, factories, and schools are actively mobilizing the masses, conducting inspections and discussions, further recognizing the political significance of economizing to make revolution, and formulating measures for increasing production and practicing thrift. The broad revolutionary masses have expressed their determination to increase production and practice thrift under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great instruction, "We must further economize to make revolution," and to resolutely fight against all thoughts and behaviors of extravagance and waste.

The revolutionary committee of Guangdong Province recently held a provincial meeting on economizing to make revolution, calling on all levels of revolutionary committees, revolutionary committee preparatory groups, and the people of the entire province to resolutely execute and fully implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "frugal construction of the country" and "we must further economize to make revolution." They must focus on revolution, vigorously promote production, resolutely oppose extravagance and waste, sweep away the counterrevolutionary economic wind, further establish the new socialist custom of thrift being glorious and waste being shameful, carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle and frugal construction, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Participants in the meeting included provincial, municipal, and relevant departments of various specialized areas, as well as representatives of the People's Liberation Army participating in the "three supports, two militaries" work. During the meeting, they repeatedly studied the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on economizing to make revolution, criticized the counterrevolutionary economism promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents, criticized various erroneous thoughts, and discussed measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "We must further economize to make revolution."

The meeting pointed out that "economizing to make revolution" is a component of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and a strategic measure to resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and prevent peaceful evolution. Whether we can fully implement Chairman Mao's great instruction, "We must further economize to make revolution," is an important content of whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can achieve a comprehensive victory. It is also an important marker of whether each person is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The proletarian revolutionary faction must definitely be a model for "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and economizing to make revolution.

The meeting required all levels of revolutionary committees, revolutionary committee preparatory groups, revolutionary mass organizations, and the broad revolutionary masses to remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Never forget class struggle," strengthen the consciousness of class struggle, focus on class struggle, resolutely eliminate the poison of counterrevolutionary economism, and be highly vigilant against the sabotage plots of domestic and foreign class enemies. They must immediately take action and do the following: First, all regions and units holding Mao Zedong thought study classes must include Chairman Mao's great instructions on "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and "we must further economize to make revolution" as study content. They must turn Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts of self-reliance, striving for strength, hard struggle, and frugal construction into the conscious actions of the broad revolutionary masses. Second, using Mao Zedong thought as a weapon, thoroughly criticize the counterrevolutionary economism promoted by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and eliminate its poison. Broadly and deeply launch the mass movement of seizing the revolution and promoting production and economizing to make revolution. Third, strengthen leadership, establish and improve leadership organs for economizing to make revolution at all levels. All levels of revolutionary committees, revolutionary committee preparatory groups, and revolutionary mass organizations must place economizing to make revolution in an important position and grasp it as a long-term policy for implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and building a socialist motherland. Fourth, seriously grasp the thrift of various materials, strictly manage finance and banking, and economize on expenditures. Currently, all industries must combine the task of supporting spring plowing production to better carry out thrift work. Fifth, discover models, establish examples, and promptly promote advanced experiences, commend units or individuals who actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and do a good job in thrift. All regions and units must promptly grasp the thrift work of key materials, hold on-site meetings, and promote advanced experiences from point to surface.

The revolutionary committee of Guangdong Province and the revolutionary committee of Guangzhou City recently held a mass rally with more than 7,000 revolutionary masses participating, calling on the broad revolutionary masses to swiftly launch a high tide of resolutely executing and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "We must further economize to make revolution."

To fully implement the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "frugal construction of the country" and "we must further economize to make revolution," organs, factories, enterprises, and schools in the Xining area are currently enthusiastically conducting study and discussion, seriously formulating measures for increasing production and practicing thrift, and are determined to fight a good "people's war" of increasing production and practicing thrift.

Many organs have, based on a deep understanding of the strategic significance of Chairman Mao's great instructions, already formulated public pacts and proposed various specific methods for greatly economizing on expenditures, ensuring that this year's administrative and operational funds, excluding wages to be paid, will be reduced by 30 to 40 percent compared to last year. Revolutionary workers in the financial and banking departments have proposed that they must strictly adhere to the state's financial and banking system, practice the principle of frugality and thrift, resolutely fight against the counterrevolutionary economic wind and wasteful behavior, and strongly support agricultural and industrial production, becoming models for implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction.

Various units, in their study and discussion, all start from analyzing the current excellent situation, deeply understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's instruction on "we must further economize to make revolution." They mentioned that Qinghai Province, like the rest of the country, currently has an excellent situation. Chairman Mao's latest instruction is being swiftly and fully implemented. Ninety percent of the prefectures and counties in the entire province have established revolutionary committees. The great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong thought is being broadly and deeply carried out. However, the class enemies are not willing to perish. They are using all despicable means in an attempt to corrupt the proletarian revolutionary faction economically. This is an important form of the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat at present. Therefore, implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction, "We must further economize to make revolution," is not merely an economic issue but a serious political struggle. It is a struggle to smash counterrevolutionary economism, resist bourgeois infiltration, and prevent peaceful evolution. This struggle is a major issue concerning the consolidation of the newly born revolutionary committees and ensuring that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is carried out to the end. The broad revolutionary masses firmly expressed in the discussion that they must, with the highest enthusiasm, the greatest determination, and the fastest speed, fully and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's great instruction and achieve new successes in the movement to increase production and practice thrift.

Not long ago, the revolutionary committee of Qinghai Province held a standing committee meeting, specially studying the implementation of Chairman Mao's great instruction, "We must further economize to make revolution," for the revolution to manage financial power well, and decided to launch a new high tide of the mass movement to increase production and practice thrift in Qinghai Province. At this standing committee meeting, based on the actual situation in Qinghai Province, specific regulations on increasing production and practicing thrift were also made. On March 2, the revolutionary committee of Qinghai Province held a grand mobilization meeting, calling on the proletarian revolutionary faction, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in the entire province to seriously implement the great leader Chairman Mao's related instructions on economizing to make revolution. This mobilization meeting further strengthened the revolutionary masses' consciousness of class struggle and greatly inspired their firm determination to implement Chairman Mao's great instruction. After the meeting, the Xining area quickly launched a high tide of enthusiastically studying and thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction, "We must further economize to make revolution."

　　全面落实伟大领袖毛主席最新指示
　　狠抓阶级斗争　进一步节约闹革命
    河北省、广东省、青海省革命委员会号召广大革命群众发扬艰苦朴素作风，迅速掀起增加生产、增加收入、反对浪费、厉行节约的群众运动
    新华社石家庄十三日电　河北省革命委员会最近举行常委会议，反复认真学习毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的最新指示，决定狠抓阶级斗争，全面落实毛主席这一最新指示，迅速掀起增加生产、增加收入、反对浪费、厉行节约的群众运动。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“要进一步节约闹革命”。参加会议的同志学习这一伟大指示的时候一致指出，毛主席的这一伟大指示绝不单纯是一个经济问题，而是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的组成部分，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的新的战斗号召。各级革命委员会、各地支左部队、各革命群众组织必须雷厉风行，迅速行动，坚决打好经济领域里的这场政治仗。
    会议强调指出，当前全省形势大好，而且越来越好，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争，正在空前广泛深入地向前发展。革命解放了生产力，农业生产去年获得了全面大丰收，工业生产蒸蒸日上，社会主义建设出现了新的跃进局面。但阶级斗争仍然是尖锐复杂的，从经济上进行腐蚀，正是当前资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的一个重要形式。
    会议列举大量事实证明，节约闹革命，反对铺张浪费，抵制资产阶级的反革命经济主义妖风，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争的一个重要方面，是无产阶级革命派防修反修，掌好权，用好权的重大问题，必须牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，彻底肃清反革命经济主义流毒，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义。只有狠抓阶级斗争，才能全面落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示。
    在讨论中，大家强调指出，能不能坚持节约闹革命，这是考验我们对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线忠不忠的问题，是考验我们能不能打好经济领域里的政治仗的问题。各级革命委员会、各地支左部队、各革命群众组织要以身作则，成为贯彻执行毛主席这一伟大指示的模范，在抓革命促生产中立新功。同时，会议还要求各地区、各部门要针对节约闹革命中的活思想，举办毛泽东思想学习班，使毛主席的伟大指示家喻户晓，变成广大革命群众的自觉行动。
    会议还对如何全面落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示作出了相应的决定。
    目前，一个轰轰烈烈的群众性增产节约运动新高潮正在全省各地蓬勃兴起。各地许多机关、工厂、学校正在放手发动群众，检查讨论，从政治上进一步认识节约闹革命的重要意义，制订增产节约的措施。广大革命群众表示，决心在毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示指引下，增加生产，厉行节约，向一切铺张浪费的思想和行为作坚决的斗争。
    新华社广州十三日电　广东省革命委员会最近召开了全省节约闹革命会议，号召各级革命委员会、革命委员会筹备小组和全省人民，坚决执行、全面落实毛主席“勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针，狠抓革命，猛促生产，坚决反对铺张浪费，横扫反革命经济主义歪风，进一步树立节约光荣、浪费可耻的社会主义新风尚，发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的光荣传统，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。
    参加会议的有省、市、各专区有关方面的负责人以及参加“三支”“两军”工作的人民解放军代表。他们在会议期间，反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于节约闹革命的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命经济主义，批判了各种错误思想，讨论了落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”最新指示的措施。
    会议指出，“要节约闹革命”，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的组成部分，是抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀、防止和平演变的战略措施。勤俭节约还是铺张浪费，是当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的一个重要方面。能不能全面落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，是无产阶级文化大革命能否取得全面胜利的一个重要内容，也是衡量每一个人是否忠于毛主席，是否忠于毛泽东思想，是否忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。无产阶级革命派一定要做“抓革命，促生产”和节约闹革命的模范。
    会议要求各级革命委员会、革命委员会筹备小组、各革命群众组织和广大革命群众，要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，加强阶级斗争观念，大抓阶级斗争，坚决肃清反革命经济主义流毒，百倍警惕国内外阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，立即行动起来，做好下列几项工作：一，各地区、各单位举办的毛泽东思想学习班，都要把毛主席“抓革命，促生产”、“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示作为学习内容，把毛主席的自力更生，奋发图强，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国的光辉思想，变成广大革命群众的自觉行动。二，以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判党内一小撮走资派推行的反革命经济主义并肃清其流毒，广泛深入地开展抓革命、促生产和节约闹革命的群众运动。三，大力加强领导，建立和健全各级节约闹革命的领导机构。各级革命委员会、革命委员会筹备小组、各革命群众组织，都要把节约闹革命放到重要地位，作为执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线，建设社会主义祖国的长期方针来抓。四，认真抓好各项物资的节约，严格财政、金融管理，节约开支。当前，各行各业都要结合支援春耕生产的任务，更好地开展节约工作。五，要发现典型，树立样板，及时推广先进经验，表扬活学活用毛主席著作，搞好节约工作的单位或个人。各地区和各单位要抓紧重点物资的节约工作，召开现场会议，以点带面地推广先进经验。
    广东省革命委员会和广州市革命委员会最近还召开了有七千多革命群众参加的誓师大会，号召广大革命群众迅速掀起坚决执行、全面落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”最新指示的高潮。
    新华社西宁十三日电　为了全面落实伟大领袖毛主席关于“勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，西宁地区的机关、厂矿、企业、学校，正在热烈地开展学习讨论，认真地制订增产节约措施，决心打好一场增产节约的“人民战争”。
    许多机关单位在深刻领会毛主席伟大指示的战略意义的基础上，已经制订了公约，提出了大力节省开支的各项具体办法，保证今年的行政、事业经费除去应发的工资以外，要比去年节省百分之三十到四十。财政、银行部门的革命职工提出，一定要严格遵守国家的财政金融制度，厉行勤俭节约原则，坚决同反革命经济主义歪风和铺张浪费行为作斗争，大力支持工农业生产，做执行毛主席这一伟大指示的模范。
    各单位在学习讨论中，都从分析当前大好形势入手，深刻领会毛主席关于“要进一步节约闹革命”指示的伟大意义。他们谈到，青海省同全国一样，当前是一片大好形势。毛主席的最新指示正在迅速全面落实。全省已有百分之九十的州、县建立了革命委员会。活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动正在广泛深入开展。但是，阶级敌人是不甘心灭亡的，他们正使出一切卑劣手段，妄图从经济上腐蚀无产阶级革命派。这是当前资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的一个重要形式。因此，贯彻执行毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，绝不是单纯的经济问题，而是一场严肃的政治斗争，是粉碎反革命经济主义、抵制资产阶级侵蚀、防止和平演变的斗争。这场斗争是关系到巩固新诞生的革命委员会、保证把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大问题。广大革命群众在讨论中坚定地表示，一定要以最高的热情，最大的决心，最快的速度，不折不扣地全面贯彻执行毛主席这一伟大指示，在增产节约运动中立新功。
    不久以前，青海省革命委员会曾经召开常委会议，专门研究了贯彻执行毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，为革命掌好财权的问题，并决定在青海省掀起增产节约群众运动的新高潮。在这次常委会上，还根据青海省的实际情况，作出了关于增产节约的具体规定。三月二日，青海省革命委员会又举行了规模盛大的动员会，号召全省无产阶级革命派、革命职工和各族革命人民，认真贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席有关节约闹革命的伟大指示。这次动员大会，进一步加强了革命群众的阶级斗争观念，大大激发了他们执行毛主席这一伟大指示的坚强决心。会后，西宁地区很快就掀起了热情学习和彻底落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示的热潮。
