People's War is Invincible
The Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile and the Dominican "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" Resolutely Support the Just Struggle of the Vietnamese People

	BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile recently wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, warmly congratulating the Vietnamese people and armed forces in South Vietnam on their brilliant victories in the anti-American national salvation war.

	The letter said: "The brilliant victories won by the people and armed forces of South Vietnam in recent months have once again played an immeasurable inspirational role in our people's struggle for liberation.

	These victories indisputably prove that American imperialism is a paper tiger, that people's war is invincible, and that the people of South Vietnam have developed people's war to a level worthy of emulation."

	The letter pointed out: "The firm will of the people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front to carry the struggle against the American aggressors and their lackeys to the end has won the respect, admiration, and support of the peoples of the world."

	The letter said: The heroism of the people of South Vietnam and their undoubted final victory will forever be recorded in the annals of human history. Their just struggle has great significance for the broad united front of the peoples of all countries against the mortal enemy, American imperialism. Through this just struggle, the people of the world are becoming clearer every day about the shameful role played by those who seek to force the Vietnamese people to surrender through the "peace talks" conspiracy.

	The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile concluded: "We once again assure you of our maximum support, promote the liberation struggle of our people, and through increasingly powerful efforts in the broadest strata of our country, carry out the movement to support and sympathize with your struggle."

	According to Xinhua News Agency, SANTO DOMINGO, March 12 -- The Central Committee of the Dominican "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" recently issued a statement, warmly congratulating the people and armed forces of South Vietnam on their brilliant victories in the anti-American national salvation war since the New Year.

	The statement said, the glorious and fighting people of Vietnam, steadfastly persisting in their sacred and heroic struggle, have fully demonstrated their boundless strength, adding glory to their time-tested heroic revolutionary tradition.

	The statement pointed out that under the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam headed by Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, the people of South Vietnam and the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people have united as one, taken up arms, and developed people's war to a higher level, dealing a fatal blow to the U.S. puppet forces, thus winning the support, love, and admiration of the entire progressive humanity, and putting the savage and criminal U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in an unprecedented predicament.

	The statement said: Chairman Mao pointed out: "All reactionary forces are bound to make desperate struggles before they are finally doomed to extinction." Based on this universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, U.S. imperialism will once again resort to its counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. Using the No. 1 running dog, the Soviet revisionists, as a tool, it will plot a "peace talks" conspiracy to prolong its rule in South Vietnam and use South Vietnam's territory as a base for invading North Vietnam, Indochina, and the People's Republic of China, as well as the entire Asia.

	The statement also quoted a passage from Chairman Ho Chi Minh: "The closer to victory, the more difficulties there will be. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will struggle more desperately."

	The statement emphasized: The people of the Dominican Republic and the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" firmly believe that the heroic people of South Vietnam will drive the aggressors out of their country.

	The statement concluded: The people of the Dominican Republic will forever fight alongside the people of Vietnam and share their victory.

　　人民战争是不可战胜的
　　智利革命共产党和多米尼加“六·一四革命运动”坚决支持越南人民正义斗争
    新华社十二日讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利革命共产党中央委员会最近写信给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会，热烈祝贺越南南方军民在抗美救国战争中取得的辉煌胜利。
    信中说：“越南南方人民和解放武装力量在最近几个月中取得的辉煌胜利，对我国人民开展自己的解放斗争又一次起了不可估量的鼓舞作用。
    这些胜利无可辩驳地证明美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，证明人民战争是不可战胜的，越南南方人民把人民战争发展到一个堪为表率的水平。”
    信中指出：“越南南方人民和民族解放阵线决心把反对美国强盗及其走狗的斗争进行到底的坚定意志，赢得了世界各国人民的敬佩、尊重和支持。”
    信中说：越南南方人民的英雄主义和无可怀疑的最后胜利，将永远载入人类的史册。他们的正义斗争，对组成各国人民反对不共戴天的死敌美帝国主义的广泛的统一战线，具有重大的意义。通过这场正义斗争，全世界人民一天比一天更清楚地认识到，那些企图通过“和谈”阴谋迫使越南人民屈服的分子所扮演的可耻角色。
    智利革命共产党中央委员会最后写道：“我们再一次保证向你们提供我们能提供的最大支持，推动我国人民的解放斗争，用越来越大的力量在我国最广泛的阶层中开展声援和支持你们斗争的运动。”
    据新华社讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加“六月十四日革命运动”中央委员会最近发表声明，热烈祝贺越南南方军民新春以来在抗美救国战争中取得的辉煌胜利。
    声明说，光荣的、战斗的越南人民，坚持神圣和英勇的抗战，充分发挥了他们无穷的力量，为他们久经考验的英勇的革命斗争传统增添了光荣。
    声明指出，越南南方人民和越南南方人民解放武装力量，在以阮友寿主席为首的越南南方民族解放阵线的正确领导下，团结一致，拿起武器，把人民战争发展到了一个更高的水平，给美伪军以致命的打击，从而赢得了整个进步人类的支持、热爱和敬佩，使残暴罪恶的美帝国主义及其走狗陷于前所未有的困境。
    声明说：毛主席指出：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”根据这个马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，美帝国主义将重新玩弄它的反革命两手策略。利用它的头号帮凶苏修集团作为工具，策划“和谈”阴谋，借此来长期维持它在越南南方的统治，并利用越南南方的领土作为侵略（越南）北方、印度支那和中华人民共和国以及整个亚洲的基地。
    声明还引用了胡志明主席的一段话：“越接近胜利，困难将会越多。敌人就象一头走投无路的野兽，将更加疯狂地挣扎。”
    声明强调指出：多米尼加人民和“六·一四革命运动”深信英雄的越南南方人民将把侵略者从他们的国土上赶出去。
    声明最后说，多米尼加人民将永远和越南人民战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
