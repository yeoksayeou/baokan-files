Thunder and lightning rage along the shores of the Gulf of Siam, and red flags flutter at the foot of Pu Pan Mountain. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the armed struggle of the Thai people is flourishing.

More than two years ago, the Thai people fired the first shot in their revolutionary armed struggle. The flames of revolution spread rapidly in all directions. Today, in seventy-one provinces nationwide, twenty-nine have already ignited the flames of revolutionary armed struggle. The Thai people's armed forces are increasingly taking the initiative to attack, engaging in nearly eight hundred battles with the enemy in just over two years, annihilating nearly two thousand enemy troops.

The rapid development of the Thai revolution is due to the Communist Party of Thailand's high举 of the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the path of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing political power through armed struggle, and applying Mao Zedong's strategies and tactics on guerrilla warfare according to Thai conditions.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao taught: "The ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the people."

From the very beginning of leading the armed struggle, the Communist Party of Thailand has focused on mobilizing the peasant masses and conducting armed struggle in the countryside. They formed "military work teams" and "armed propaganda teams," entering the countryside to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, and expose to the broad peasant masses the savage aggression of American imperialism and the treacherous crimes of the Thanom-Praphat clique. They led and supported the peasants in their struggles against traitors and local tyrants, punishing the most heinous landlords, traitors, and spies. In some regions where conditions are ripe, they are forming base areas. Currently, in many places in the northeastern, northern, and southern regions of Thailand, the peasants have been widely mobilized. It is under the protection and help of the people that the people's armed forces, like fish in water, have keen eyes and ears, free movement, and can continuously seize the initiative in battle. Despite the repeated "encirclement and suppression" campaigns by the American-Thai reactionaries against the regions where armed struggle is being conducted, and their implementation of the barbaric "three-all" policy of burning, killing, and looting, the people's armed forces have not only not been annihilated but have grown stronger and achieved one victory after another.

In battle, the Thai people's armed forces actively apply the tactics of guerrilla warfare formulated by Chairman Mao. They often "divide forces to mobilize the masses and concentrate forces to deal with the enemy," sometimes forming small teams to enter vast rural areas to organize and mobilize the masses, and sometimes concentrating forces to ambush enemy troops, attack enemy outposts, and destroy enemy vehicles. They are elusive and flexible. Therefore, the people's armed forces, which are generally at a disadvantage, can concentrate superior forces in each specific battle to gradually annihilate the temporarily strong enemy, continuously growing stronger and turning small victories into big victories. The people's armed forces apply Chairman Mao's basic military principles of guerrilla warfare, the sixteen-character formula: "Retreat when the enemy advances, harass when the enemy halts, attack when the enemy tires, and pursue when the enemy retreats," fully exploiting the power of guerrilla warfare, striking the enemy with great terror.

Currently, the heroic Vietnamese people have already tied down more than five hundred thousand American troops, annihilating more than three hundred thousand American invaders and their lackeys. Recently, the powerful offensive launched by the military and people of South Vietnam has left the American invaders in disarray. The patriotic armed forces of Laos are fiercely striking the American invaders and their lackeys. The flames of the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle are burning brighter. The armed struggles of the people of Indonesia, the Philippines, and other countries in Asia against American imperialism and its lackeys are also rising. The American imperialism, with all ten fingers spread wide, is being struck by the peoples of Southeast Asian countries, making it difficult to cope. As long as the peoples of all countries suffering from American aggression and enslavement unite, fight American imperialism with people's wars on their own battlefields, cooperate and support each other, striking its head while others strike its feet, then the peoples of all countries can divide and conquer the American imperialist giant, eating it bit by bit.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the armed struggle of the Thai people is advancing with great momentum. On the road of revolution, no matter how severe the difficulties and twists and turns the Thai people may encounter, as long as they hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and wage a protracted people's war, they will definitely defeat American imperialism and its lackey, the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique. The final victory will surely belong to the heroic Thai people who persist in the struggle!

    普潘山下红旗招展
    本报评论员
    暹罗湾畔风雷激荡，普潘山下红旗招展。在泰国共产党的领导下，泰国人民武装斗争呈现一片蓬勃发展的大好形势。
    两年多以前，泰国人民打响了革命武装斗争的第一枪，革命的烈火以迅猛之势向四面八方蔓延开来。今天，全国七十一个府中，已有二十九个府燃起了革命武装斗争的烽火。泰国人民武装越来越频繁地主动出击，两年多时间内总共同敌人战斗近八百次，歼灭敌人近两千人。
    泰国革命形势所以这样迅猛发展，是由于泰国共产党高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的道路，并根据泰国的特点，运用了毛主席关于游击战争的战略战术。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席教导说：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”
    泰国共产党从领导武装斗争的第一天起，就把发动农民群众，在农村开展武装斗争作为工作的重心。他们组成“武工队”、“武装宣传队”，深入农村，宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，向广大农民群众揭露美帝国主义的野蛮侵略和他侬—巴博集团的卖国罪行；领导和支持农民开展锄奸反霸斗争，惩处罪大恶极的地主恶霸和奸细、特务；有些条件成熟的地区，正在形成根据地。目前，泰国东北部、北部和南部等地区许多地方的农民广泛发动起来了。正是在人民群众的掩护和帮助下，人民武装力量如鱼得水，耳目灵通，行动自由，能够不断地争取战斗的主动权。尽管美泰反动派对开展武装斗争的地区进行一次又一次的“围剿”，实行野蛮的烧光、杀光、抢光的“三光”政策，但人民武装力量不仅没有被消灭，反而发展壮大，取得了一次又一次的胜利。
    泰国人民武装在战斗中活学活用毛主席所制定的游击战争的战术。经常“分兵以发动群众，集中以应付敌人”，时而组成小分队深入广大农村组织和发动群众，时而又集中兵力伏击敌军，袭击敌军哨所，炸毁敌人车辆。神出鬼没，机动灵活。因此，在全体上还处于劣势的人民武装力量，能够在每次具体战斗中，集中优势兵力，一部分一部分地消灭在全体上暂时强大的敌人，不断壮大自己，积小胜为大胜。人民武装力量运用毛主席关于游击战争的基本军事原则十六字诀：“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”，充分发挥了游击战争的威力，打得敌人惊魂不定。
    当前，英雄的越南人民，已经牵制了五十多万美国军队，歼灭了美国侵略军和帮凶军三十多万人。最近，越南南方军民发动的强大攻势，打得美国侵略军七零八落。老挝爱国武装力量正在狠狠打击美国侵略者及其走狗。泰国人民革命武装斗争的烈火，越烧越旺。亚洲地区的印尼、菲律宾等国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争也正在兴起。十个指头都张得很开的美帝国主义，被东南亚各国人民打得顾此失彼，穷于应付。只要遭受美国侵略和奴役的各国人民都团结起来，在各自的战场上用人民战争来对付美帝国主义，相互配合，相互支援，你打它的头，我打它的脚，那末，各国人民就可以把美帝国主义这个庞然大物分割开来，一口一口地吃掉。
    泰国人民的武装斗争在泰国共产党的领导下，正在高歌猛进。泰国人民在革命的征途上，不管会碰到多么严重的困难和曲折，只要高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进行持久的人民战争，就一定能够打败美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团。最后的胜利一定属于坚持战斗的英雄的泰国人民！
