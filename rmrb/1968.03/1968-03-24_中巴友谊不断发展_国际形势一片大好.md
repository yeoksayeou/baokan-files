Ambassador Sultan and Vice Premier Chen Yi Speak at Pakistan's National Day Reception

The international situation is developing in a way that fully confirms the wise judgment of Chairman Mao: "The enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day." The thriving scene of the revolutionary cause of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America has greatly encouraged all revolutionary people around the world. The failure of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam has led to extremely serious economic consequences. The shadow of the economic crisis is looming over the entire capitalist world, and imperialism is in chaos with unprecedented contradictions. As the accomplices of U.S. imperialism, modern revisionists are on their last legs. The February Black Conference further exposed their traitorous faces of surrendering to imperialism and betraying the interests of the revolutionary people, and revealed the disintegration and fragmentation of the modern revisionist group.

New China News Agency, March 23 – Ambassador Sultan Muhammad Khan of Pakistan to China held a reception in Beijing tonight to celebrate the National Day of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and Saifuddin, as well as Zhu Rongji, Lin Haiyun, and Han Nianlong, and other relevant officials attended the reception at the invitation.

Ambassador Sultan and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke at the reception, jointly wishing for the continuous consolidation and development of the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan. In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the development of the situation fully confirms the wise judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: "The enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day."

Ambassador Sultan said in his speech that in the past few years, the two countries have made progress in cooperation in many aspects. The friendship and good-neighborly relations between Pakistan and China are based on mutual non-interference in internal affairs, respect for territorial integrity, and mutual benefit. This friendship and cooperation are a constructive and positive driving force for peace and prosperity in our region.

The ambassador said that Pakistan highly admires the great and comprehensive progress made by the People's Republic of China under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong on the basis of self-reliance. We wish the great Chinese people greater achievements, progress, and prosperity.

He said, we believe that the People's Republic of China is fully qualified to play a leading role in international affairs. We firmly reject the fallacy of "two Chinas." We resolutely support the People's Republic of China's right to representation in the United Nations and all other international organizations. He said, the Pakistani people will forever remember with gratitude the firm support given by China when they were in a national crisis. We thank China for its cooperation and assistance in the economic development of Pakistan. This precious assistance and support have further strengthened the friendship between the two countries. We are deeply convinced that the relations between the two countries will continue to strengthen.

In his speech, Ambassador Sultan introduced the situation of Pakistan's economic construction and foreign policy.

Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the Pakistani people for their glorious tradition of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. He said that the Pakistani government and people recently foiled foreign plots to subvert and split Pakistan, exposing the evil deeds of imperialism and modern revisionism in arming India and threatening the security of Pakistan and the South Asian region. The just struggle of the Pakistani people has won the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and the world.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: "The just struggles of the people of all countries in the world are mutually supportive," "The Chinese people regard the victories of the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their own victories, and give enthusiastic support to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles." The Chinese government and people, in accordance with this teaching, firmly support the just struggle of the Pakistani government and people to oppose foreign aggression and interference, safeguard national sovereignty and national independence, and firmly support the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for national self-determination.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that in recent years, the friendly cooperative relations between China and Pakistan have continued to develop, and mutual understanding has deepened. Although imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries are extremely hostile to Sino-Pakistani friendship and constantly instigate and sabotage it, due to the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of the two countries, their plots have all suffered disgraceful failures. The Chinese government and people will, as always, make unremitting efforts to promote the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the current international situation is excellent, and the development of the situation fully confirms the wise judgment of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao: "The enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day."

He said, the thriving scene of the revolutionary cause of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America has made the revolutionary people of the world feel extremely excited and greatly encouraged. The great victory of the military and people of South Vietnam in the spring has opened up a new situation in the Vietnam War of resistance against U.S. aggression and national salvation. The U.S. imperialists' plot to play both counter-revolutionary hands, on the one hand, crazily expanding the war, on the other hand, playing the "peace talk" trick, but these cannot shake the determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to fight a protracted war. The U.S. imperialists are deeply mired in the quagmire of the Vietnam War, beaten everywhere, and have no way out, and cannot escape the fate of being ultimately annihilated. At present, the fierce arguments within the U.S. ruling class over the Vietnam War issue are a reflection of their dilemma and embarrassment.

He said, the failure of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam has led to extremely serious economic consequences. Now, the United States and the Western world are facing the most serious currency and financial crisis in more than thirty years. The capitalist financial and monetary system with the U.S. dollar as the main body is beginning to collapse. The shadow of the economic crisis is looming over the entire capitalist world, and imperialism is in chaos with unprecedented contradictions.

He said, modern revisionists, as accomplices of U.S. imperialism, are also on their last legs, and their days are getting worse. The February Black Conference further exposed their traitorous faces of surrendering to imperialism and betraying the interests of the revolutionary people, and revealed the disintegration and fragmentation of the modern revisionist group.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is achieving comprehensive victory. The people of the whole country are full of vigor and enthusiasm, and are launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Now, the revolutionary people of the world have a clearer understanding of the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. They are excited and inspired by the victories achieved by the Chinese people. The slanders and attacks of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries against our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are becoming more and more bankrupt in the face of ironclad facts. The victory of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will surely promote the leap-forward development of our industrial and agricultural production and the further strengthening of our national defense forces. We will better support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Our cause is thriving. Our future is bright. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, together with the revolutionary people of the world, and with all countries and peoples suffering from U.S. imperialist aggression, control, interference, and bullying, struggle together to oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism, and strive for the thorough liberation of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world.

Those who attended the reception at the invitation also included officials from various government departments, the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

Envoys from various countries to China also attended the reception.

    苏尔坦大使和陈毅副总理在巴基斯坦国庆招待会上讲话
    中巴友谊不断发展　国际形势一片大好
    陈毅副总理说，国际形势的发展完全证实了毛主席的英明论断：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。亚非拉人民革命事业的兴旺景象，使全世界革命人民得到极大鼓舞。美国侵越战争的失败，引起了极为严重的经济后果。经济危机的阴影笼罩着整个资本主义世界，帝国主义内部一片混乱，矛盾空前激化。作为美帝帮凶的现代修正主义日暮途穷。二月黑会进一步暴露了它们投降帝国主义、出卖革命人民利益的叛徒面目，暴露了现代修正主义集团的分崩离析，支离破碎。
    新华社二十三日讯  巴基斯坦驻中国大使苏尔坦·穆罕默德·汗，为巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国国庆日，今晚在北京举行招待会。
    国务院副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若、赛福鼎，以及粟裕、林海云、韩念龙等有关方面的负责人，应邀出席了招待会。
    苏尔坦大使和陈毅副总理在招待会上先后讲了话，共祝中巴两国人民的友谊不断巩固和发展。陈毅副总理在讲话中谈到当前国际形势一片大好时指出，形势的发展完全证实了我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。
    苏尔坦大使在讲话中说，在过去几年里，巴中两国在许多方面的合作都有了发展。巴中两国的友谊和睦邻关系是建立在互不干涉内政，尊重领土完整和互利的基础上的。这种友谊和合作对我们地区的和平与繁荣是一种建设性和积极的推动。
    大使说，巴基斯坦十分钦佩中华人民共和国在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，在自力更生的基础上所取得的巨大的全面的进步。我们祝伟大的中国人民取得更大的成绩、进步和繁荣。
    他说，我们认为中华人民共和国完全有资格在国际事务中起领导作用。我们断然拒绝关于“两个中国”的谬论。我们坚决支持中华人民共和国在联合国和所有其他国际组织中的代表权。他说，巴基斯坦人民永远以感激的心情记住，当他们处于民族危急的时刻中国所给予的坚决支持。我们感谢中国在巴基斯坦发展经济方面所给予的合作和援助。这种珍贵的援助和支持使两国之间的友谊得到了进一步的巩固。我们深信，两国关系今后将继续不断地增强。
    苏尔坦大使在讲话中介绍了巴基斯坦经济建设的情况和外交政策。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中赞扬巴基斯坦人民具有反帝反殖的光荣传统。他说，巴基斯坦政府和人民最近粉碎了外来的颠覆和分裂巴基斯坦的阴谋，揭露了帝国主义和现代修正主义加紧武装印度、威胁巴基斯坦和南亚地区安全的罪恶勾当。巴基斯坦人民的正义斗争，赢得了中国人民以及亚非和世界各国革命人民的同情和支持。
    陈毅副总理说，中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的”，“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”中国政府和人民根据这一教导，坚决支持巴基斯坦政府和人民反对外来侵略和干涉、维护国家主权和民族独立的正义斗争，坚决支持克什米尔人民争取民族自决权利的正义斗争。
    陈毅副总理说，近几年来，中巴两国的友好合作关系不断发展，相互间的了解不断加深。尽管帝、修、反都十分仇视中巴友谊，并且不断进行挑拨和破坏，但是，由于中巴两国政府和人民的共同努力，它们的阴谋都遭到了可耻的失败。中国政府和人民将一如既往，为增进中巴两国的友好合作关系作出不懈的努力。
    陈毅副总理说，当前国际形势一片大好，形势的发展完全证实了中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。
    他说，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命事业的兴旺景象，使全世界的革命人民感到无比的兴奋，得到极大的鼓舞。越南南方军民的新春大捷，打开了越南抗美救国战争的新局面。美帝国主义耍弄反革命两手的阴谋，一方面疯狂扩大战争，一方面大搞“和谈”骗局，但是，这些都动摇不了英雄的越南人民持久抗战的决心。美帝国主义深陷在侵越战争的泥潭之中，到处挨打，走投无路，逃脱不了最后被消灭的命运。目前，美国统治集团内部环绕着侵越战争问题的激烈争吵，正是它们进退维谷、狼狈不堪的处境的反映。
    他说，美国侵越战争的失败，引起了极为严重的经济后果。现在，美国和西方世界正面临着三十多年来最严重的一次货币、金融危机。以美元为主体的资本主义金融货币体系，开始走向崩溃。经济危机的阴影笼罩着整个资本主义世界，帝国主义内部一片混乱，矛盾空前激化。
    他说，作为美帝帮凶的现代修正主义，也是日暮途穷，日子越来越不好过。二月黑会进一步暴露了它们投降帝国主义、出卖革命人民利益的叛徒面目，暴露了现代修正主义集团的分崩离析，支离破碎。
    陈毅副总理说，史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命正在取得全面胜利。全国人民意气风发，斗志昂扬，正在掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。现在，世界革命人民更加清楚地认识到我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，他们为中国人民所取得的胜利欢欣鼓舞。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派对我国无产阶级文化大革命的诬蔑和攻击，在铁的事实面前，已经越来越破产。我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，必将促进我国工农业生产的飞跃发展和国防力量的进一步加强。我们将更好地支援世界人民的革命斗争。我们的事业蓬勃兴旺。我们的前途一片光明。我们将更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，同世界革命人民一道，同所有受到美帝国主义侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家和人民一道，为反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，为争取全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的彻底解放而共同奋斗。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有政府各部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会的负责人。
    各国驻中国的使节也出席了招待会。
