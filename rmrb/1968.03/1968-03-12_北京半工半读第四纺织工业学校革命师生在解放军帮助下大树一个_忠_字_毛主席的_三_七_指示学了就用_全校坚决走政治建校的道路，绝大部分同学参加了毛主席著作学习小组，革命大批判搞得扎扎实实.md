Under the radiant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive, and with the assistance of the military training personnel from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force and the support team from the 8341 Unit stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Beijing Fourth Textile Vocational School have steadfastly implemented Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and a series of latest instructions, firmly walking the path of building the school politically. They started from class education, focusing on the "loyalty" to the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, turning the military training process into a process of forging the "loyalty," thereby bringing about a profound change in the ideological outlook of the entire school.

In the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, plant a "loyalty"

To plant a "loyalty" to the great teacher Chairman Mao, one must first deeply cultivate proletarian feelings towards Chairman Mao.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "If one does not understand what class is, does not understand what exploitation is, one does not understand revolution." The PLA soldiers responsible for military training, after entering the school, gave the first lesson by guiding the revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," focusing on class education. In conjunction with this education, they organized revolutionary teachers and students to visit the "Rent Collection Hall," "Red Guards' Achievements Exhibition," and "Exhibition of Crimes of the Capitalist Reactionary Line." They invited workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and PLA soldiers to the school six times to share their bitter experiences from the old society, discuss the great kindness of Chairman Mao, expose the crimes of the capitalist reactionary line, and talk about the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary teachers and students listened attentively to the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and PLA soldiers' denunciations of the old society, each filled with indignation. At the same time, they used their family histories to angrily denounce the dark old society, exposing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in promoting the capitalist reactionary line and the anti-revolutionary revisionist educational line, attempting to restore capitalism. The revolutionary teachers and students said: "The more we hate the old society, the clearer we see China's Khrushchev's conspiracy, and the more loyal we are to the great leader Chairman Mao."

To plant a "loyalty" to the great teacher Chairman Mao, one must raise the understanding of the great Mao Zedong Thought. The PLA comrades helped the revolutionary teachers and students to extensively carry out the "three loyalties" education activities: loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyalty to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They also carried out the "four infinities" education activities: infinite love, infinite faith, infinite admiration, and infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They spoke highly of Chairman Mao's unparalleled greatness, unparalleled wisdom and correctness, unparalleled great contributions to the Chinese revolution and world revolution, Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, and the new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The entire school's revolutionary teachers and students, with "criticizing selfishness and revisionism" as the key, took Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, and firmly planted a "loyalty" to Chairman Mao. The revolutionary teachers and students voluntarily examined their own gaps with the "loyalty," found the roots of "selfishness," and raised their proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao to a new height. They said: "We grew up in the new era of Mao Zedong Thought, living by the side of Chairman Mao. In our minds, we should be filled with 100% Mao Zedong Thought and a 'loyalty' to Chairman Mao." Through this series of education, the school's atmosphere of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works was very strong. Over 95% of the students joined the study groups of Chairman Mao's works. To express their infinite love and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students spent three consecutive nights embroidering a giant portrait of Chairman Mao. This embroidered portrait embodies the loyalty of every revolutionary teacher and student to Chairman Mao.

In implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, test the "loyalty"

To Chairman Mao's every battle command, whether it is learned and applied, or learned but not applied, and secretly disobeyed, is an important sign of testing loyalty to Chairman Mao.

To apply, one must firmly implement Chairman Mao's instructions that are understood, and also firmly implement those that are not fully understood at the moment, deepening the understanding in the process of implementation. Last March, when different viewpoints among the revolutionary masses in the school were about to erupt into "internal warfare," the great leader Chairman Mao issued the brilliant March 7th Directive to us. The PLA comrades immediately organized the revolutionary teachers and students to study, guiding everyone to fiercely fight against "selfishness" and break down the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. Through the study, the revolutionary teachers and students expressed their determination to be promoters of revolutionary great unity. They firmly believed that every word of Chairman Mao is the truth, and Chairman Mao's instructions are the highest battle commands. They resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, which is the most loyal to Chairman Mao. The six revolutionary mass organizations in the entire school quickly leveled the hills and achieved revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes. Immediately after, they achieved the liberation of cadres through revolutionary great criticism, implemented the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and established the revolutionary committee.

To apply, one must follow the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, eliminating all interference and following through to the end. Chairman Mao called for "resuming classes and making revolution," so they focused on ideological work, overcame various obstacles, and resumed classes and made revolution. However, due to the impact of anarchist trends and factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie in society, many students could not sit still or listen, and some even thought this was "using class resumption to suppress the revolution and change the direction of the struggle." In this situation, whether to insist on resuming classes and making revolution, or to stop classes and make revolution? This is a principle issue of whether to follow or deviate from Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and whether to firmly implement or violate Chairman Mao's instructions. With the help of the PLA comrades, they decided to eliminate all interference and, with the actual action of insisting on class resumption, test their "loyalty" to Chairman Mao. The broad revolutionary teachers and students studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," correcting their attitudes towards resuming classes and making revolution. After their understanding improved, the revolutionary teachers and students were full of revolutionary enthusiasm and high spirits, launching a high tide of resuming classes and making revolution and educational revolution. They carried out a great criticism of the anti-revolutionary revisionist educational line, further deeply carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and appropriately resumed some business courses such as knitting, dyeing, and drafting. They taught and learned in criticism, taught and changed in criticism; and organized personnel to conduct investigations and learning in over thirty schools including full-time, part-time, and secondary vocational schools, and visited over fifty old workers and technicians in factory workshops to seek opinions. Based on this, they preliminarily formulated a teaching reform plan. For several months, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students have been insisting on resuming classes and making revolution with full revolutionary enthusiasm.

To apply, the most fundamental thing is to have a revolutionary explosion in the depths of the soul, fiercely fight against "selfishness," and firmly establish "publicness." Since the military training, the PLA comrades have always placed helping the revolutionary teachers and students to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, break down selfishness and establish publicness, and transform their worldview at the forefront of all work. The revolutionary committee first held a Mao Zedong Thought study class, fiercely fighting against the selfishness of committee members who do not serve each other, are afraid, and are irresponsible in their work, and first establishing the "loyalty" to the great leader Chairman Mao among the committee members. Immediately after, they held Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the school, launching a mass movement of criticizing selfishness and revisionism. The more they fought, the more they hated "selfishness," and the more they fought, the redder their thoughts became.

In the great waves of class struggle, temper the "loyalty" to Chairman Mao

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the masses' struggles and grow in the tempering of revolutionary storms and stresses." The revolutionary teachers and students realized that they must, in the great waves of class struggle, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, temper the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and temper the "loyalty" to the great leader Chairman Mao.

After achieving revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, this school quickly launched a great criticism and struggle against China's Khrushchev. They studied Chairman Mao's works and Vice Chairman Lin's preface to the second edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of opposing Mao Zedong Thought; studied Chairman Mao's discussions on class and class struggle, fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinction"; studied the "Old Three Articles," fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's philosophy of survival, traitor philosophy, and "merging public and private"; studied Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution, fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's anti-revolutionary revisionist educational line. The revolutionary youngsters charged forward in the great criticism, taking the lead. They said: "The pen in our hands is not an ordinary pen. On this small pen tip, it condenses our unparalleled loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and our unparalleled hatred for China's Khrushchev."

Just as they were implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive to achieve revolutionary great unity and fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev, a strong "demolition wind" swept through society, fiercely impacting the school. In early May last year, a part of the students in the school were influenced by anarchist trends and set up another faction. At this time, some people from other schools who came to connect also said that the great unity of the Fourth Textile School was a "big compromise" and a "big squeeze," and they said, "We will definitely demolish the stage of the Fourth Textile School's great unity." In an instant, the atmosphere in the school became very tense. The entire school's revolutionary teachers and students and the newly established revolutionary committee faced a serious struggle to defend Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With the help of the PLA, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, overcoming the idea of having a big fight with comrades who withdrew from the revolutionary great unity. They said: "Loyalty to Chairman Mao is tested in critical moments." The more complex the situation, the more we should act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They deeply and meticulously carried out ideological and political work, firmly believing in the power of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly believing that comrades who withdrew from the revolutionary great unity would definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words. Many students did not even rest on Sundays, going to the homes of comrades who withdrew from the revolutionary great unity to do ideological work, vigorously propagating Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive. In less than half a month, comrades who withdrew from the great unity returned to the revolutionary great unity team one after another, expressing their determination to firmly walk the revolutionary path guided by Chairman Mao. Thus, the revolutionary teachers and students held a warm welcome meeting. After this test of impact, the revolutionary great unity of this school was not only not demolished but also became more solid. At the same time, through this struggle to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students' "loyalty" to Chairman Mao was tempered again.

　　北京半工半读第四纺织工业学校革命师生在解放军帮助下大树一个“忠”字
　　毛主席的“三·七”指示学了就用
　　全校坚决走政治建校的道路，绝大部分同学参加了毛主席著作学习小组，革命大批判搞得扎扎实实
    据新华社十一日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席“三·七”指示的光辉照耀下，在人民解放军空军某部军训人员和八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员的帮助下，北京市半工半读第四纺织工业学校的革命师生，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，走政治建校的道路。他们从阶级教育入手，狠抓对无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的一个“忠”字，把军训的过程变成锤炼“忠”字的过程，使全校革命师生的思想面貌发生了深刻的变化。
    在对毛主席和毛泽东思想的态度上，大树一个“忠”字
    对伟大导师毛主席大树一个“忠”字，首先要把对毛主席的无产阶级感情搞得深深的。
    林彪副主席说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”担负军训任务的解放军指战员进校后，第一课就是辅导革命师生学习毛主席的光辉著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》，大抓阶级教育。配合这一教育，他们组织革命师生参观了“收租院”“红卫兵战果展览”和“资产阶级反动路线罪行展览”，先后六次请工人、贫下中农和解放军战士来校，同革命师生一起大诉旧社会的苦，大谈伟大领袖毛主席的恩情，大揭资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，大谈毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。革命师生认真听了工人、贫下中农和解放军战士对旧社会的控诉，个个满腔怒火，同时用自己的家史，愤怒地控诉了黑暗的旧社会，揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线和反革命修正主义教育路线，企图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。革命师生说：“对旧社会越恨，对中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋就看得越清，对伟大领袖毛主席就越忠。”
    对伟大导师毛主席大树一个“忠”字，就要把对伟大的毛泽东思想的认识提得高高的。解放军同志帮助革命师生广泛开展了忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”和对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的“四无限”的教育活动，大讲毛主席的无比伟大，大讲毛主席的无比英明正确，大讲毛主席对中国革命和世界革命无比伟大的贡献，大讲毛主席的伟大革命实践，大讲世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。全校革命师生以“斗私，批修”为纲，以林副主席为光辉榜样，大树特树对毛主席的一个“忠”字。革命师生自觉地查自己同“忠”字的差距，找“私”字的根源，把忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情提到了一个新的高度。他们说：“我们生长在伟大的毛泽东思想新时代，生活在毛主席的身边，在我们的头脑里，就应当百分之百地装上毛泽东思想，装上对毛主席的一个‘忠’字。”通过这一系列的教育，学校活学活用毛主席著作的空气很浓厚。百分之九十五以上的学生参加了毛主席著作学习小组。为了表达对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，全校革命师生还用了三个通宵的时间，一针一线地绣出了毛主席的巨幅像。这幅绣像，凝聚着每一个革命师生对毛主席的一片忠心。
    在执行毛主席最新指示中检验“忠”字
    对毛主席发出的每一个战斗号令，是学了就用，坚决照办，还是学了不用，阳奉阴违，这是检验对毛主席忠不忠的一个重要标志。
    用，就要对毛主席的指示，理解的坚决执行，暂时不完全理解的也坚决执行，在执行中加深理解。去年三月，正当学校里不同观点的革命群众即将爆发“内战”的时候，伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出了光辉的“三·七”指示。解放军同志立即组织革命师生进行学习，引导大家狠斗“私”字，大破资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。通过学习，革命师生纷纷表示，要做革命大联合的促进派。他们深信毛主席的话句句是真理，毛主席的指示就是最高的战斗号令，坚决照毛主席的指示去做，就是对毛主席最忠。全校六个革命群众组织，很快削平山头，实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合。紧接着，又通过革命大批判，解放了干部，实现了革命三结合，成立了革命委员会。
    用，就要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，排除一切干扰，紧跟到底。毛主席号召“复课闹革命”，他们就大抓活思想，克服各种阻力，复课闹革命。但是，由于社会上无政府主义思潮和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的冲击，有不少同学坐不下，听不进，有的甚至认为这是“拿复课压革命，扭转斗争大方向”。在这种情况下，是坚持复课闹革命，还是停课闹革命？这是关系到紧跟还是背离毛主席伟大战略部署，坚决执行还是违背毛主席指示的原则问题。在解放军同志帮助下，他们决心排除一切干扰，以坚持复课的实际行动，来检验对毛主席的“忠”字。广大革命师生大学毛主席的“老三篇”和《将革命进行到底》等光辉著作，端正对复课闹革命的态度。认识提高以后，革命师生意气风发，斗志昂扬，掀起了复课闹革命和教育革命的高潮，开展了对反革命修正主义教育路线的大批判，进一步深入开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，同时，适量地复了针织、染化、制图等业务课，在批判中教，在批判中学，边教边改；并且组织专人先后到全日制、半工半读、中专等三十多所学校进行调查、学习，到工厂车间找了五十多位老工人、技术员征求意见，并在这个基础上，初步制定了教改方案。几个月来，全校革命师生一直以满腔的革命热情坚持了复课闹革命。
    用，最根本的是在灵魂深处爆发革命，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字。军训以来，解放军同志一直把帮助革命师生活学活用毛泽东思想，破私立公，改造世界观放在一切工作的首位。革命委员会首先举办了毛泽东思想学习班，狠斗革委会成员中互不服气，“怕”字当头，工作不负责任等私心，在革委会成员中首先树起对伟大领袖毛主席的“忠”字。紧接着又通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，在全校革命师生中掀起群众性的斗私批修高潮。大家越斗，对“私”字越恨，越斗，思想越红。
    在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锤炼对毛主席的“忠”字
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”革命师生认识到，必须在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，活学活用毛泽东思想，锻炼无产阶级革命事业的接班人，锤炼对伟大领袖毛主席的“忠”字。
    这个学校在实现了革命大联合和革命三结合以后，迅速开展了对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判、大斗争。他们大学毛主席著作和林副主席为《毛主席语录》写的《再版前言》，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行；大学毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”；大学“老三篇”，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学、叛徒哲学和“公私溶化论”；大学毛主席教育革命的光辉思想，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义教育路线。革命小将在大批判中冲锋陷阵，一马当先。他们说：“我们挥动的不是普通的笔，这小小的笔尖上，凝结着我们对伟大领袖毛主席的无比忠诚，凝结着对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。”
    正当他们按照毛主席的“三·七”指示实现革命大联合，奋起狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的时候，社会上刮起的一股“拆台风”，猛烈地冲击着学校。去年五月初，学校有一部分同学受无政府主义思潮的影响，另立山头。这时候，外校来串连的一些人也说四纺校的大联合是“大凑合”“大捏合”，还说“四纺校大联合的台我们拆定了”。霎时间，学校的气氛变得很紧张。全校革命师生和刚刚建立起来的革命委员会，面临着一场捍卫毛主席“三·七”指示，捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的严重斗争。他们在解放军的帮助下，遵照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，克服了要和退出革命大联合的同志大干一场的想法。他们说：“对毛主席忠不忠，紧要关头看行动。”越是情况复杂，越要按照毛主席指示办事。他们深入做艰苦细致的思想政治工作，坚信毛泽东思想的威力，坚信退出革命大联合的同志一定会听毛主席的话。许多同学星期日也不休息，到退出革命大联合的同志家里去做思想工作，大力宣传毛主席的“三·七”指示。不到半个月，退出大联合的同志纷纷回到了革命大联合的队伍里，表示今后一定要坚定不移地走毛主席指引的革命道路。于是，革命师生召开了热烈的欢迎大会。经过这次冲击的考验，这个学校的革命大联合不但没有被冲垮，反而更加巩固了。同时，通过这次捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的斗争，全校革命师生对毛主席的“忠”字，又受了一次锤炼。
