The revolutionary committee of Xinanjiang Power Plant, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, emphasizes proletarian politics and is full of revolutionary spirit. Upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they immediately study and swiftly implement them. The committee members always maintain close ties with the masses, accept supervision from the masses, and do not engage in special privileges. The entire plant's revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination are continuously strengthened, and the spirit of thrift and revolution is prevalent throughout the plant.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 29th: The People's Liberation Army personnel stationed at Xinanjiang Power Plant have brought the good traditions and experiences of the People's Liberation Army, such as being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the Four Firsts, and promoting the Three-Eight Style, to the revolutionary committee of this plant. They have earnestly helped the committee members with their ideological revolutionization, making the committee a powerful fighting command center that emphasizes proletarian politics, is full of revolutionary spirit, and maintains close ties with the masses.

After the establishment of the Xinanjiang Power Plant Revolutionary Committee, the PLA personnel stationed there fully respected, supported, and enthusiastically helped the committee members with their ideological revolutionization. The stationed PLA personnel first brought the spirit of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the plant's revolutionary committee. The stationed personnel believed that loyalty to Chairman Mao should be reflected in the application of Mao Zedong Thought and in the swift and earnest implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions. Therefore, they first helped the plant's revolutionary committee members to grasp the attitude of studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Soon after the establishment of the committee, the stationed personnel helped it organize a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, attended by committee members and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations. During the class, they emphasized the application of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The participants, through reminiscence and comparison activities, deeply realized that implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is victory. Studying Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions without applying them is disloyalty to Chairman Mao. Therefore, they checked the implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions item by item during the class, with deep proletarian feelings of infinite love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, and proposed measures for fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Now, whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao come, the plant's revolutionary committee immediately takes action, studies earnestly, and implements them swiftly. When the New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily was published in 1968, the committee members immediately studied it earnestly, promptly drafted implementation measures, and convened a rally to pledge the implementation of the five battle tasks. The committee used seven days to launch a "people's war" against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. The committee members and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as weapons, fought against factionalism while deeply entering the workshops to solicit opinions, bravely exposing their private thoughts and factionalism to the masses, and swiftly launching a campaign to overcome factionalism throughout the plant, strengthening the revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

The stationed personnel earnestly introduced the experiences of the People's Liberation Army in emphasizing proletarian politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to solve the active thoughts of the masses, and doing good ideological and political work to the committee members, and personally practiced good ideological and political work among the masses. They often went deep into the masses, conducted heart-to-heart talks and investigations, grasped the active thoughts of the masses the most and the most accurately, and did timely and effective ideological work, setting an example for the committee members. Many people, seeing the stationed personnel's example of doing ideological and political work, were moved and said: "We must learn the good experience of the PLA, who are full of class feelings for the masses, unafraid of troubles and repetitions, and insist on arming the minds of the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, doing meticulous and arduous ideological and political work." There was a leading cadre who, in the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, had poor self-awareness, and had serious antagonistic feelings towards the masses. Two committee members were assigned to do ideological work with this cadre. The initial few talks were not effective, and these two members began to waver in their thoughts. At this time, they recalled how the PLA did ideological work, realizing that the key problem was that their own ideological work was not thorough. They decided to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate him, so that Chairman Mao's policy on cadres could be fully implemented. They then earnestly grasped this cadre's active thoughts, patiently and meticulously did the work, and finally educated a cadre who had been at odds with the masses for over a year. The committee members tasted the sweetness of doing ideological work, and they more consciously went deep into reality, deep into the masses, conducted investigations, grasped the active thoughts of the masses, conducted heart-to-heart talks, and united the revolutionary masses firmly on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

The People's Liberation Army stationed personnel, in helping the revolutionary committee to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, paid attention to bringing the PLA's fine traditions of hard work, simplicity, and close ties with the masses to the revolutionary committee, making the committee always maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit and a close relationship with the masses. During the Spring Festival, the committee members and the stationed personnel together went deep into the workshops and teams, participated in holiday maintenance with the workers, and braved the wind and snow to visit workers' families, inquiring about their well-being. They also sent a committee member hundreds of miles away to visit a retired old worker, bringing Mao Zedong's portrait, Mao Zedong badges, and Mao Zedong's revolutionary books. Usually, the committee members maintained close ties with the masses, accepted supervision from the masses, and lived modestly without special privileges. In managing financial power, the committee members remembered Chairman Mao's instructions to "build the country through thrift" and "promote revolution through thrift," spending money carefully. The committee members' spirit of hard work and thrift had a great influence on the entire plant's staff. The spirit of thrift and revolution has become a common practice among the plant's staff. A mass campaign of increased production and thrift is vigorously underway at Xinanjiang Power Plant. (Accompanying photo)

    新安江发电厂革委会在解放军帮助下突出无产阶级政治充满革命干劲
    听到毛主席最新指示立即学习迅速落实
    革委会成员始终保持同群众的密切联系，处处接受群众监督，不搞特殊化。全厂革命大联合和革命三结合不断巩固，节约闹革命在全厂形成风气
    据新华社杭州二十九日电　人民解放军驻新安江发电厂支左人员，以饱满的政治热情，把人民解放军无限忠于毛主席，活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的好传统、好经验带给这个厂的革命委员会，认真帮助革命委员会成员搞好思想革命化，使革委会成为一个突出无产阶级政治，充满革命干劲，同群众保持着密切联系的有力的战斗指挥部。
    新安江发电厂革命委员会成立后，在这个厂支左的解放军同志充分地尊重它、支持它，同时满腔热情地帮助革命委员会的成员搞好思想革命化。支左的解放军同志，首先把人民解放军无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“忠”字带给这个厂的革命委员会。支左人员认为，对毛主席的忠，要体现在对毛泽东思想的“用”字上，要体现在最迅速最认真地贯彻执行毛主席的指示上。因此，他们首先帮助厂革委会的成员狠抓对毛主席最新指示的学用一致的态度。厂革委会成立不久，支左人员就帮助它举办了一期有革委会成员、革命群众组织负责人参加的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班上，对毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示，狠抓一个“用”字。参加学习班的同志通过忆比活动，深深认识到，落实毛主席的最新指示就是胜利。对毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示学了不用，就是对毛主席不忠。于是，他们就在学习班里对毛主席一系列最新指示的落实情况，逐条逐条地进行检查，怀着无限热爱、无限忠于毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情，提出了全面落实毛主席最新指示的措施。现在，毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令一来，厂革命委员会就闻风而动，认真学习，迅速落实。《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论一发表，革委会成员立即认真学习，马上拟订出落实的措施，并召开了落实五项战斗任务的誓师大会。厂革委会用七天时间，开展了一场反对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”。革委会成员和革命群众组织负责人以毛主席最新指示为纲，以“老三篇”为武器，一面自己狠斗派性，一面深入到班组征求意见，大胆地向群众亮私心斗派性，在全厂雷厉风行地掀起了一个打倒派性的热潮，巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    支左人员认真把人民解放军突出无产阶级政治、用毛泽东思想解决群众的活思想，做好思想政治工作的经验介绍给革委会成员，同时身体力行认真做好群众的思想政治工作。他们经常深入群众，通过开展谈心活动和调查研究，对群众的活思想掌握得最多，摸得最准，思想工作做得及时有力，为革命委员会成员做出了样子。许多人看到支左人员做思想政治工作的榜样，感动地说：“我们一定要把解放军对群众充满阶级感情，不怕麻烦、不怕反复，坚持用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑，做细致艰苦的思想政治工作的好经验学到手。”有一个领导干部，无产阶级文化大革命初期执行了资产阶级反动路线，认识错误较差，和群众的对立情绪严重。革命委员会两个同志分工去做这个领导干部的思想工作。开始几次谈话，成效不大，这两个同志思想上有些动摇了。这时，他们想起解放军如何做思想工作的情景，感到关键问题是自己思想工作没有做到家。决心要用毛泽东思想把他教育过来，使毛主席的干部政策得到全面落实。他们就认真抓好这个干部的活思想，耐心细致地进行工作，终于把一个和群众“顶牛”了一年多的干部教育了过来。革命委员会成员从做思想工作中尝到了甜头，他们更自觉地深入实际，深入群众，调查研究，抓好群众的活思想，开展谈心活动，把革命群众在毛泽东思想的基础上紧紧地团结在一起。
    人民解放军支左人员，在帮助革命委员会活学活用毛泽东思想中，注意把我军艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的优良传统带给革命委员会，使革命委员会始终保持着朝气勃勃的革命精神，并且同群众保持了血肉相连的关系。过春节的时候，革委会成员和支左人员一起，深入到车间、班组，和工人一起参加节日检修；并且冒着风雪严寒去访问工人家庭，问寒问暖，还派了一个委员到几百里路外看望一个退休的老工人，给老工人送去了毛主席画像、毛主席像章和毛主席的革命宝书。平时，革委会成员和群众保持着密切的联系，处处接受群众的监督，生活上做到不特殊化。在管理财权中，革委会成员牢记毛主席“勤俭建国”、“要节约闹革命”的指示，花钱精打细算。革委会成员艰苦奋斗的精神，对全厂职工有很大影响。节约闹革命在全厂职工中已形成风气。一个群众性的增产节约活动，正在新安江电厂轰轰烈烈地掀起。（附图片）
