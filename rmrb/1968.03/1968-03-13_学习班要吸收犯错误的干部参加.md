The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Beijing Dyeing and Printing Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support group stationed at the factory, have allowed cadres who have made mistakes to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, achieving very good results.

Comrade Mao Zedong, in his great strategic deployment for the Cultural Revolution, the "March 7th" directive, teaches us: "We must implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself. During military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes. Except for the elderly and the sick, let these people participate, so as to facilitate their reform."

Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for transforming people's souls. Cadres who have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, as long as they are not traitors, spies, or diehard capitalist roaders, should be united with and educated, helped to correct their mistakes. Educating and helping cadres who have made mistakes to firmly stand on Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line is a major task of the Cultural Revolution and an unavoidable responsibility of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

To achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, we need to mobilize a vast revolutionary army, and we need more cadres to come forward and revolutionize. Only in this way can we promote and consolidate revolutionary great alliances, strengthen revolutionary three-in-one leadership teams, consolidate new revolutionary committees, and unite all forces that can be united, isolating and striking at a handful of class enemies to the greatest extent possible.

Mao Zedong Thought study classes are a good way to liberate cadres ideologically and politically. The proletarian revolutionary masses should have a great heart for liberating all of humanity. They should not abandon or overthrow cadres just because they have made mistakes. They should allow cadres who have made mistakes to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, so that through the education and help of the masses, they can, through criticizing and repudiating their own selfishness and revisionism, recognize and correct their own mistakes, thoroughly transform their worldview, and gain the understanding of the masses. At the same time, the proletarian revolutionary masses can also learn from the mistakes made by cadres, promoting their own ideological revolutionization.

　　学习班要吸收犯错误的干部参加
　　本报评论员
    北京印染厂的无产阶级革命派，在驻厂人民解放军支左小组帮助下，让犯错误的干部参加毛泽东思想学习班，收到了很好的效果。
    毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命伟大战略部署的“三·七”指示中教导我们：要“实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导，在军训时不要排斥犯错误的教师和干部。除老年和生病的以外，要让这些人参加，以利改造。”
    毛泽东思想是改造人们灵魂的强大思想武器。犯了错误，即使犯了严重错误的干部，只要不是叛徒、特务和顽固不化的走资派，都应当团结、教育他们，帮助他们改正错误。教育和帮助犯过错误的干部坚定地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，这是无产阶级文化大革命的一项重大任务，也是无产阶级革命派的不可推卸的责任。
    夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，需要调动浩浩荡荡的革命大军，需要更多的干部站出来革命。这样，才有利于促进和巩固革命的大联合，有利于加强革命三结合的领导班子，巩固新生的革命委员会，有利于团结一切可以团结的力量，最大限度地孤立和打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    毛泽东思想学习班，是从思想上、政治上解放干部的好办法。无产阶级革命派要有解放全人类的伟大胸怀，不要干部一犯错误就抛弃他们，打倒他们。应当吸收犯错误的干部参加毛泽东思想学习班，让他们在群众的教育和帮助下，通过斗私批修，认识和改正自己的错误，彻底改造自己的世界观，并取得群众的谅解。同时，无产阶级革命派也可以从干部犯错误中吸取经验教训，促进自己的思想革命化。
