Chairman Mao's Latest Directive

The basic experiences of the revolutionary committees have three points: one is to have representatives of revolutionary cadres, one is to have representatives of the military, and one is to have representatives of revolutionary masses, thus realizing the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline personnel, and organize a revolutionary and mass-linked leading cadre team.
