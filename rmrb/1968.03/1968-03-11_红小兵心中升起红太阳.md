The red sun rises in the hearts of the Red Guards.
Beijing Xiangfang Road Primary School Revolutionary Committee

Red is blooming in the city of Beijing, and Xiangfang Primary School is bathed in the morning sun.
Our school, with over 1,300 revolutionary teachers and students, is full of vigor and enthusiasm, celebrating the first anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the "March 7th Directive."

The Red Guards are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, following him with all their hearts. In carrying out the "March 7th Directive," the Red Guards have launched a wave of learning Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution, thoroughly criticizing the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev. Some people used to say: Today's children are all raised under the red flag, and there is no class struggle. Through the struggle, everyone deeply felt that under the control of China's Khrushchev and his agents, the primary school has always suppressed class and class struggle, completely failing to highlight Mao Zedong Thought, turning into a "nursery" for cultivating the successors of the bourgeoisie.

The Red Guards bravely took to the podium to criticize themselves and expose revisionism. Senior-grade Red Guards also denounced the harm of the revisionist educational line to their junior-grade classmates, helping them understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution. The Red Guards also enthusiastically helped teachers reform teaching methods and actively handled the revolutionary teacher-student relationship. After one teacher finished a class, a Red Guard sincerely said to him: "Teacher! Your class was still a lecture-style one. You should study Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution well." The teacher was very moved and said: "In the past, I was afraid I couldn't teach the students because they were naughty; now if I don't study Chairman Mao's works well and learn from the students, I really can't teach them."

We are a two-shift school. How to organize extracurricular half-day learning activities and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy the extracurricular battlefield is also a major issue related to how to carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end. Under the leadership of the school revolutionary committee, the Red Guards General Service Team organized three sessions of extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes and, taking the lead, universally organized extracurricular Chairman Mao's works study groups. These groups, with Red Guards as the backbone, are organized by proximity to home. Senior-grade Red Guards tutor junior-grade students in learning, and invite workers, peasants, and soldiers as tutors.

The extracurricular Chairman Mao's works study groups continuously hold self-criticism and expose revisionism meetings, carry out activities such as visiting the poor and asking about hardships, and supporting the military and caring for veterans. According to incomplete statistics, during the winter vacation alone, the extracurricular study groups held over 200 self-criticism and expose revisionism meetings and visited 40 military families. After studying, some Red Guard soldiers can already recite and apply over 160 quotations from Chairman Mao.

The extracurricular Chairman Mao's works study groups also widely organized Red Guard soldiers and non-Red Guard students to carry out "one helps one, one becomes red" activities. The students' ideological appearance has changed greatly. Parents generally reflect that in the past, children would fight when they came home, but now they come home to read Chairman Mao's books, sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, and some even use Mao Zedong Thought to help parents solve ideological problems, which is really not simple!

Now, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has become the first need in the life of the Red Guards. The Red Guards study and apply the "Three Articles" extensively, taking the shining images of Zhang Zedong, White Fur, and Old Fool as examples, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions. For example, Zhang Jieqiu from the Sixth Company, First Platoon, used to not care much about the collective. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he personally made glue and pasted all the windows in the classroom. After the teacher's praise, he still checked himself in the self-criticism meeting of the study class: "I have not yet done it 'completely' and 'thoroughly.' I only pasted the windows of my own class, and I did not think about the first-grade students whose classroom windows also need to be pasted. This shows that I still need to break private interests and establish public interests, and use high standards to demand of myself." The next day, with his lead, more than ten classmates together pasted all the windows in the first-grade classrooms.

The "one helps one, one becomes red" activity of the Red Guards is very active. "One becomes red" together to study Chairman Mao's works, together to criticize themselves and expose revisionism, and together to do good deeds for the collective. If there are problems between "one becomes red," they use Mao Zedong Thought to solve them. For example, a Red Guard became arrogant and looked down on her companion. The other person gave her a quotation from Chairman Mao: "The attitude of the Communist Party members towards backward people is not to despise them, look down on them, but to be close to them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." And attached a note: "Now I am progressing slower than you, but in the future, I am determined to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I will definitely become a Red Guard of Chairman Mao. I hope you can follow Chairman Mao's teachings to help me progress." This Red Guard was very moved, holding her companion's hand, with tears in her eyes, admitting her mistake in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. From then on, they cared for each other, loved each other, and helped each other, and both made great progress.

The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We will continue to sail forward to victory along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao's great "March 7th Directive"!

　　红小兵心中升起红太阳
　　北京香厂路小学革命委员会
    北京城里红烂漫，香厂小学尽朝晖。
    我校一千三百多名革命师生，意气风发，斗志昂扬，欢庆伟大领袖毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署的指示——“三·七”指示发出一周年。
    红小兵最忠于毛主席，一心紧跟毛主席。在执行“三·七”指示中，红小兵团掀起了学习毛主席教育革命思想的热潮，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线。原来有人说：现在的儿童都是在红旗下长大的，不存在阶级和阶级斗争的问题。通过大批判，大家深切地体会到，在中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人控制下的小学，一贯抹杀阶级和阶级斗争，根本不突出毛泽东思想，变成了培养资产阶级接班人的“苗圃”。
    红小兵勇敢地走上讲台斗私批修。高年级红小兵还向低年级同学控诉修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害，帮助低年级同学理解毛主席教育革命思想的伟大意义。红小兵也热情地帮助教师改革教学，主动地处理好革命的师生关系。一位老师上完一节课后，有个红小兵诚恳地对他说：“老师！你这一节课，还是注入式的，你要好好学习毛主席的教育革命思想。”这位老师很感动，他说：“过去我怕教不了学生，是怕他们淘气；现在我要不好好学习毛主席著作，不向学生学习，可就真教不了他们了。”
    我们是二部制学校，如何组织校外半天的学习活动，让毛泽东思想占领校外阵地，也是关系到如何把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的一个大问题。在校革委会领导下，红小兵总勤务组先后组织了三期校外毛泽东思想学习班，并且以点带面，普遍地组织了校外毛主席著作学习小组。这些小组以红小兵为骨干，按家庭居住远近编组。高年级红小兵辅导低年级同学学习，并请工、农、兵当辅导员。
    校外毛主席著作学习小组，不断地开斗私批修讲用会，开展访贫问苦、拥军优属等活动。据不完全统计，仅在寒假期间，校外学习小组就召开了二百多次斗私批修讲用会，慰问了四十户军属。经过学习，有的红小兵战士已能背诵和运用一百六十多条毛主席语录。
    校外毛主席著作学习小组，还广泛地组织红小兵战士和非红小兵同学开展“一帮一、一对红”的活动。同学们的思想面貌起了很大的变化。家长们普遍反映，过去孩子回家来就打闹，现在回来就读毛主席的书，唱毛主席语录歌，有的还用毛泽东思想帮助家长解决思想问题，真是不简单！
    现在，活学活用毛泽东思想，已成为红小兵生活中的第一需要。红小兵大学大用“老三篇”，以张思德、白求恩和老愚公的光辉形象为榜样，用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动。如六连一排张洁秋同学，过去不太关心集体，学习了《为人民服务》后，自己打了浆糊，把教室的窗户都糊好了。老师表扬后，他还在学习班的斗私会上检查说：“我还没有做到‘完全’、‘彻底’，只顾糊自己班的窗户，没有想到一年级小同学有的教室的窗户也要糊。这说明我还要不断破私立公，用高标准要求自己。”第二天，在他的带动下，十几名同学一起把一年级所有教室的窗户都糊好了。
    红小兵的“一帮一、一对红”活动非常活跃。“一对红”一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起为集体做好事。“一对红”之间发生了问题，就用毛泽东思想来解决。如有一个红小兵骄傲了，看不起自己的同伴，对方就送给她一条毛主席语录：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”并附了一张字条：“现在我进步比你慢，但是今后我有决心读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，我一定要做毛主席的红小兵，希望你能按照毛主席的教导，帮助我进步。”这个红小兵看了以后非常感动，拉着对方的手，含着热泪在毛主席像前承认了自己的错误。从此以后，他们互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，双方都有很大进步。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。我们将继续沿着毛主席的伟大“三·七”指示所指引的航向胜利前进！
